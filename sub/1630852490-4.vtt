Listen up!

00:47.310 --> 00:49.590
This is your agent from now on.

00:49.590 --> 00:51.270
His name is Jin Du-ho.

00:51.740 --> 00:52.740
Hello!

00:55.160 --> 00:56.160
Huh?

00:56.630 --> 00:59.290
Korea Top Star regional preliminaries, Gangwon-do?

00:59.950 --> 01:01.030
Wild Ginseng Boys!

01:01.050 --> 01:02.240
Yeah, that's right.

01:02.240 --> 01:03.240
Thank you.

01:03.380 --> 01:05.790
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:05.870 --> 01:07.380
- Seriously.
- What? What? What?

01:07.380 --> 01:09.760
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Sir, come here. Come on.

01:10.340 --> 01:12.030
What's with his name?

01:12.070 --> 01:13.180
James or Edward.

01:13.180 --> 01:15.320
I said I wanted names like that!

01:15.350 --> 01:17.310
Whoa, were you serious?

01:17.310 --> 01:18.250
What the...

01:18.250 --> 01:19.920
Giving us a lame name

01:19.920 --> 01:22.030
might lead to our ruin.

01:22.030 --> 01:23.880
But you call us Cotton Candy?

01:23.880 --> 01:25.530
That's so embarrassing.

01:25.530 --> 01:28.000
Then go back to what it used to be.

01:28.120 --> 01:29.740
Seriously...

01:29.780 --> 01:30.770
Come on, sir!

01:30.770 --> 01:33.340
Hey, I love Cotton Candy.

01:33.520 --> 01:36.130
Since you'll be like cotton candy that gives

01:36.130 --> 01:39.850
comfort, happiness and love to the world.

01:40.170 --> 01:41.600
- Come on, Sir!
- What is he talking about?

01:41.630 --> 01:43.810
We'll be ruined because of our name.

01:43.810 --> 01:44.960
- Du-ho.
- Yes?

01:44.960 --> 01:46.130
Who are you a fan of in Cotton Candy?

01:46.130 --> 01:48.330
Oh, I'm a fan of...Oh Hyun-ji.

01:48.330 --> 01:50.200
Hyun-ji! He's your fan. Come here.

01:50.750 --> 01:51.750
Hyun-ji!

01:52.620 --> 01:54.530
No! Never!

01:55.220 --> 01:57.440
Since Du-ho is here, let's leave her out.

01:57.570 --> 01:58.759
Please do your best!

01:58.780 --> 01:59.539
Oh, yes.

01:59.570 --> 02:01.040
We look forward to working with you!

02:01.040 --> 02:02.320
I'll do my best.

02:02.600 --> 02:03.730
Fight on!

02:12.790 --> 02:16.660
Can you feel this trembling?

02:16.890 --> 02:21.470
Do you feel the same way?

02:21.520 --> 02:26.450
Time has stopped as if I'm in a dream

02:27.520 --> 02:30.230
Is this love?

02:32.210 --> 02:35.420
I look around and lovers are everywhere

02:35.680 --> 02:39.820
I was sad that I was alone

02:41.400 --> 02:44.970
But I saw you by my side

02:46.329 --> 02:47.810
What do you think this is?

02:50.020 --> 02:51.020
Dust?

02:51.829 --> 02:54.210
Wipe it all clean!

02:54.880 --> 02:55.880
Seriously!

02:58.140 --> 03:04.090
- Hello! We're Cotton Candy!
- Hello!

03:16.010 --> 03:18.780
- What?
- Leave! You're confusing me!

03:18.780 --> 03:20.650
Alright! I'll just watch!

03:25.800 --> 03:26.800
Eat up.

03:33.090 --> 03:34.530
What in the world?

03:34.690 --> 03:35.660
Oh! No, no, no.

03:35.660 --> 03:37.340
They're eating right now.

03:37.690 --> 03:39.690
You can get your photos later.

03:41.070 --> 03:42.930
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

03:43.020 --> 03:44.660
Huh? Where are you going?

03:46.900 --> 03:47.930
Hyun-ji!

03:52.520 --> 03:53.520
Come quick!

04:00.570 --> 04:02.500
- What?
- What are you doing?

04:04.280 --> 04:06.340
Imagining you and me walking together

04:06.340 --> 04:08.760
My cheeks blush as if I found happiness

04:08.760 --> 04:10.380
Even though the path we're walking on

04:10.380 --> 04:11.540
Is different for a while

04:11.540 --> 04:13.690
Let's hold hands tightly and walk together

04:13.690 --> 04:15.680
We're going to be a pretty couple

04:15.680 --> 04:18.880
I'll be your only lover

04:19.100 --> 04:21.870
Come closer to me

04:24.070 --> 04:25.050
Eat up, eat up.

04:25.050 --> 04:28.030
- Bon appetit!
- Bon appetit!

04:28.380 --> 04:30.910
No, it's okay. You guys eat. I'm fine.

04:30.950 --> 04:34.030
We don't give drumsticks to just anyone. Eat up.

04:34.440 --> 04:35.800
Come on, take it.

04:35.840 --> 04:36.840
Take it.

04:37.150 --> 04:38.320
Thank you.

04:49.920 --> 04:50.920
Awesome!

04:51.159 --> 04:51.970
Du-ho.

04:52.170 --> 04:55.050
Was your dream to become a singer?

04:55.460 --> 04:56.460
No.

04:57.060 --> 04:58.350
Then why did you

04:59.030 --> 05:01.030
go on a dancing competition show?

05:02.580 --> 05:04.690
I danced at the village party.

05:05.290 --> 05:07.630
Everyone said I was good and suggested it.

05:08.530 --> 05:10.930
That's why you failed.

05:11.570 --> 05:14.200
You have to have a dream.

05:16.370 --> 05:19.000
When CEO Ma introduced me to you,

05:19.650 --> 05:21.330
I felt like my ancestors

05:21.820 --> 05:24.340
gave me a second chance in life.

05:24.750 --> 05:26.360
I believed so.

05:27.620 --> 05:29.000
To be a good agent

05:29.180 --> 05:30.900
for the successful Cotton Candy.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.560
That's my dream.

05:37.010 --> 05:38.110
So you all

05:38.540 --> 05:39.820
have to make it.

05:45.070 --> 05:46.070
My girls...

05:48.350 --> 05:49.850
What will happen to them?

06:14.400 --> 06:15.530
Seobit Medical Center Funeral Hall

06:21.500 --> 06:23.060
They're here.

09:09.830 --> 09:15.270
Part 4
How to Use Your 1% Potential

09:21.420 --> 09:22.490
Interview with New CEO Cha Jae-hyuk

09:22.250 --> 09:24.960
Your priority is going public, right?

09:24.990 --> 09:25.990
Of course.

09:26.300 --> 09:28.150
That's the biggest reason

09:28.150 --> 09:29.880
the board hired me.

09:32.570 --> 09:33.760
In order to go public,

09:34.270 --> 09:35.870
I will, by and large,

09:37.090 --> 09:38.770
clean up the company.

09:39.300 --> 09:41.740
- Please write a good article for us.
- Don't worry.

09:41.740 --> 09:43.720
- Goodbye. Goodbye.
- Bye.

09:45.810 --> 09:46.810
Hey.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.520
It's Cotton Candy's file.

09:48.520 --> 09:50.060
Tomorrow's the meeting.

09:50.760 --> 09:52.040
CEO Ma

09:52.180 --> 09:53.520
was going to give Cotton Candy

09:53.520 --> 09:55.470
another chance. Director Yoon told me.

09:55.470 --> 09:56.470
Really?

09:57.310 --> 09:58.750
But it's all over.

10:00.170 --> 10:01.650
It doesn't look too good.

10:01.930 --> 10:03.080
People think the reason Du-ho died

10:03.080 --> 10:04.650
was because of Cotton Candy.

10:06.590 --> 10:08.300
I heard the CEO died as well.

10:08.300 --> 10:10.330
What if the unit group of Mars gets pushed back?

10:10.330 --> 10:12.490
This is all that failed idol group's fault.

10:12.490 --> 10:13.610
Crazy jerks.

10:13.960 --> 10:15.650
A person has died.

10:17.010 --> 10:18.750
You call yourselves human?

10:19.040 --> 10:20.320
A person has died.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.120
You trash idiots!

10:22.220 --> 10:23.590
Stop it!

10:25.100 --> 10:26.250
Crazy fools.

10:26.940 --> 10:28.740
I'm going to kill them all!

10:33.000 --> 10:34.680
Do something about her.

10:34.720 --> 10:36.400
She's driving me crazy.

10:45.210 --> 10:47.130
Stop it, please!

10:47.130 --> 10:48.660
What do they know?

10:48.660 --> 10:49.980
How dare they!

10:50.420 --> 10:52.980
This won't help. It's useless!

10:52.980 --> 10:54.370
Let go!

10:55.730 --> 10:57.860
I'm going to rip them to pieces!

11:09.750 --> 11:10.750
Jenna.

11:13.210 --> 11:15.390
I think Hyun-ji will get in big trouble.

11:15.640 --> 11:16.480
She won't sleep.

11:16.480 --> 11:17.960
She chases after fan websites

11:17.960 --> 11:19.060
and fights with people.

11:20.430 --> 11:21.620
Go stop her.

11:23.070 --> 11:24.590
She listens to you.

11:25.310 --> 11:26.310
Huh?

11:32.250 --> 11:33.250
Jenna.

11:34.770 --> 11:36.450
You can't be like this.

11:40.470 --> 11:42.490
Then tell me what to do.

11:44.100 --> 11:45.780
Since you're like this,

11:45.850 --> 11:47.680
it seems like it's really all over.

11:49.600 --> 11:50.720
Du-ho wouldn't

11:52.530 --> 11:54.190
have wanted this.

12:01.230 --> 12:04.030
How do you know what a dead person thinks?

12:07.360 --> 12:08.360
Stella.

12:10.620 --> 12:12.060
Don't do anything.

12:15.830 --> 12:17.030
We're finished.

12:21.250 --> 12:23.160
Stella! Stella!

12:23.570 --> 12:25.250
It's Hyun-ji!

12:31.450 --> 12:33.980
Is it true that Highteen's agent bravely died

12:33.980 --> 12:35.650
while trying to promote a failed idol group?

12:35.650 --> 12:37.340
He should've died trying to promote Highteen.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.080
Why'd he sacrifice himself for a failed group?

12:39.100 --> 12:40.880
You're not even human.

12:41.050 --> 12:42.760
Die and go to hell!

12:42.890 --> 12:44.660
Your parents and siblings as well!

12:44.660 --> 12:47.240
Are you Cotton Candy? Why flip out?

12:47.240 --> 12:49.440
Yeah, I'm Cotton Candy's Hyun-ji.

12:49.460 --> 12:51.580
If you're so great, reveal yourselves! Don't hide.

12:51.580 --> 12:54.650
Seriously? She's here in person. Awesome.

12:54.700 --> 12:56.640
I'm better than you, failed idol singer.

12:56.640 --> 12:58.160
Come out! Come out!

12:58.360 --> 13:00.680
Let's see if you can do this in person!

13:00.680 --> 13:02.910
Whoa, real life player kill? State the place.

13:02.910 --> 13:04.040
Let's see a failed idol's face.

13:04.040 --> 13:05.330
Don't hightail it and write the address.

13:05.330 --> 13:06.340
I'm coming now.

13:06.340 --> 13:07.630
You think we'll be intimidated?

13:07.630 --> 13:09.530
Come to Center Internet CafÃ© in Sangam-dong.

13:09.530 --> 13:10.610
We'll wait until 10 PM.

13:10.610 --> 13:12.030
You're so dead!

13:23.410 --> 13:24.180
You thought

13:24.200 --> 13:26.200
we'd be scared because you're a celebrity?

13:27.320 --> 13:28.950
You can't do a thing, but you acted so fierce?

13:29.490 --> 13:31.290
You're full of spirit, huh?

13:31.580 --> 13:34.160
You should've sung with this spirit.

13:34.190 --> 13:36.620
Then you wouldn't have failed.

13:36.950 --> 13:39.400
It's true the dead guy isn't your agent, right?

13:39.720 --> 13:40.670
Because of him,

13:40.670 --> 13:42.730
you nobodies got famous, right?

13:42.750 --> 13:44.210
Then he did die after promoting

13:44.210 --> 13:45.650
you nobodies, right?

13:45.650 --> 13:46.860
Am I wrong?

13:47.190 --> 13:49.720
Why flip out and call us out at night?

13:51.360 --> 13:52.360
Hey!

13:52.660 --> 13:55.240
Let go! Let go!

14:08.620 --> 14:11.730
Why does what Du-ho does always fall apart?

14:11.950 --> 14:14.500
You're half the reason we failed!

14:14.500 --> 14:15.360
I'll be there soon.

14:15.360 --> 14:16.980
Go to a nearby coffee shop.

14:17.110 --> 14:19.470
There's no coffee shop in this countryside!

14:20.950 --> 14:23.040
That's enough. Let's go.

15:03.500 --> 15:04.890
Chae-ah! She's not there?

15:04.890 --> 15:05.890
No.

15:05.990 --> 15:07.640
- Where is she?
- Let's try over there.

15:07.920 --> 15:09.840
- Hyun-ji!
- Hyun-ji!

15:10.580 --> 15:11.580
Hyun-ji!

15:12.210 --> 15:13.210
Hyun-ji!

15:13.540 --> 15:14.750
Oh Hyun-ji!

15:16.630 --> 15:17.290
Hey!

15:17.290 --> 15:18.160
Are you okay?

15:18.210 --> 15:20.280
So why did you do that?

15:20.280 --> 15:21.280
Hyun-ji!

15:38.470 --> 15:39.570
Cotton Candy Expenditures Itemized

15:39.610 --> 15:41.420
It costs more to maintain this group

15:41.420 --> 15:43.100
than to breach their contract.

15:43.100 --> 15:45.300
Talk of early disbanding came up continuously.

15:46.080 --> 15:48.850
Well, CEO Ma couldn't make a decision.

15:49.020 --> 15:49.900
Why?

15:49.940 --> 15:51.200
They're the founding members.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.050
He has a lot of affection for them.

15:55.110 --> 15:56.710
I guess that's important

15:56.780 --> 15:57.970
to this company.

15:59.360 --> 16:01.090
Are there no other reasons

16:01.130 --> 16:02.730
for keeping them on?

16:04.810 --> 16:06.610
What do you all think?

16:07.690 --> 16:08.900
This group...

16:10.080 --> 16:11.080
Is there

16:12.490 --> 16:13.490
potential?

16:27.390 --> 16:29.680
Bbiyong wrote a new song for our unit.

16:29.980 --> 16:31.340
Check your email.

16:32.070 --> 16:33.750
He has a new concept.

16:33.890 --> 16:34.890
By the way,

16:35.300 --> 16:37.570
didn't you rearrange the previous song?

16:38.750 --> 16:40.920
I just did it because I was frustrated.

16:42.320 --> 16:44.060
Go to the office tomorrow.

16:44.280 --> 16:45.720
It's been 2 weeks.

16:45.890 --> 16:46.930
Go say hello.

16:48.300 --> 16:49.980
Whenever I played this,

16:52.080 --> 16:53.760
CEO Ma snorted, you know?

17:02.410 --> 17:04.609
I changed the lyrics to diss him.

17:06.750 --> 17:08.160
Half of it was cursing him.

17:13.720 --> 17:14.720
One time,

17:15.880 --> 17:16.550
in the studio,

17:16.550 --> 17:18.349
I was singing my heart out.

17:20.099 --> 17:21.270
CEO Ma

17:21.920 --> 17:24.490
You must not know who to thank

17:24.560 --> 17:26.220
I guess you'd think you succeeded

17:26.220 --> 17:28.190
But everyone knows (yeah)

17:28.290 --> 17:31.570
You're a pot-bellied old man with a 40-inch waist

17:31.910 --> 17:32.590
Look in the mirror

17:32.610 --> 17:35.420
You lack sense like you lack hair

17:35.540 --> 17:38.850
Come on, old man, don't act that way

17:39.200 --> 17:41.930
Your rambling speech hurts my ears

17:41.930 --> 17:45.990
You'd kill for my abs, no doubt

17:49.650 --> 17:51.760
I didn't know it, but he was listening.

17:51.920 --> 17:53.200
I was so scared.

17:53.990 --> 17:56.900
But he changed the words and dissed me right back.

18:00.200 --> 18:02.250
The lyrics were so childish.

18:03.890 --> 18:05.570
But they were sincere.

18:09.650 --> 18:11.100
It really stuck with me.

18:11.130 --> 18:13.190
Have you ever done a rap battle with an old man?

18:13.480 --> 18:14.310
Ji-han.

18:14.310 --> 18:16.040
I knelt right away like a man.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.950
He sometimes won me over like that.

18:24.130 --> 18:25.220
If you're not seeing CEO Cha

18:25.220 --> 18:26.450
because you can't let CEO Ma go...

18:27.510 --> 18:28.460
You're wrong.

18:33.030 --> 18:34.860
I haven't let CEO Ma go yet.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.300
But that's not why I can't accept that jerk.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.390
I just don't want to see him.

18:43.550 --> 18:44.550
That jerk

18:46.490 --> 18:47.530
is perverted.

18:47.740 --> 18:49.630
Even a tiny bit of potential.

18:49.630 --> 18:53.300
When you say "tiny," how much do you mean?

18:54.750 --> 18:57.630
1% potential is the best.

18:59.700 --> 19:01.250
With absurd logic...

19:01.250 --> 19:02.250
1%?

19:03.920 --> 19:06.490
He stabs a dagger in your heart and enjoys it!

19:06.490 --> 19:08.480
If there's even 1% potential,

19:08.920 --> 19:10.650
then I give them a chance.

19:10.920 --> 19:12.350
I get out my calculator later.

19:12.350 --> 19:14.210
He's an arrogant narcissist.

19:18.870 --> 19:21.250
The reason 1% potential is the best

19:22.990 --> 19:25.400
is because no one will bet on it.

19:25.710 --> 19:26.910
Because it means

19:27.190 --> 19:29.190
you take the biggest bite.

19:30.480 --> 19:31.860
But still,

19:31.860 --> 19:34.180
betting on 1% is too big of a risk.

19:34.490 --> 19:35.990
Reducing the risk

19:36.090 --> 19:37.770
is your job, isn't?

19:39.420 --> 19:41.270
So tell me.

19:43.440 --> 19:44.640
Does this group

19:45.770 --> 19:47.410
have that 1% potential

19:47.820 --> 19:48.970
to make it?

19:49.310 --> 19:50.310
In one word,

19:51.110 --> 19:52.630
he's not trustworthy.

19:55.010 --> 19:56.010
1%?

19:56.370 --> 19:58.630
Why do we have to reduce the risk?

19:59.330 --> 20:01.010
To put the blame on us?

20:01.630 --> 20:03.540
They say he's the Midas touch in investment.

20:03.540 --> 20:04.910
There was a reason for it.

20:04.910 --> 20:06.980
Midas, my foot. Minus is more like it.

20:07.690 --> 20:09.520
He's a calculator handling money.

20:09.550 --> 20:11.290
What does he know?

20:11.910 --> 20:14.440
The ability to recognize a talent in this business

20:15.130 --> 20:16.830
is a composite art.

20:17.320 --> 20:19.250
Didn't you know?

20:19.380 --> 20:20.390
CEO Cha,

20:20.390 --> 20:22.150
before he joined an investment company,

20:22.150 --> 20:23.160
he was a competent A&R

20:23.160 --> 20:24.770
in an American agency.

20:24.110 --> 20:26.320
A&R: Responsible for talent scouting,
overseeing the artist's artistic development,

20:24.890 --> 20:26.190
- Really?
- Yes!

20:26.320 --> 20:28.260
discovering songs that fit,
drawing a contract and production

20:26.600 --> 20:28.300
So what? Huh?

20:29.100 --> 20:30.100
Sir.

20:31.210 --> 20:33.710
Is it true CEO Ma was going to give Cotton Candy

20:33.920 --> 20:34.960
another chance?

20:36.630 --> 20:37.220
Yes.

20:37.220 --> 20:38.280
Shouldn't we tell them?

20:38.280 --> 20:39.100
Who?

20:39.450 --> 20:40.540
The girls?

20:41.040 --> 20:42.980
You want to kill them twice?

20:49.100 --> 20:50.130
I also think

20:51.060 --> 20:52.660
that team has no potential.

20:52.660 --> 20:54.630
Then why did you ask us earlier?

20:55.130 --> 20:57.030
Because I want to know what you think.

20:57.210 --> 20:58.390
Weren't all of you

20:58.920 --> 21:00.150
negative about it?

21:01.560 --> 21:02.700
Give them one more chance.

21:02.700 --> 21:03.250
Hey.

21:03.270 --> 21:04.560
What chance?

21:04.630 --> 21:05.630
Sir.

21:06.260 --> 21:08.650
Think of it as CEO Ma's dying wishes.

21:09.330 --> 21:11.760
You mean you want them to know

21:13.240 --> 21:15.950
that they don't have even 1% potential?

21:17.800 --> 21:19.480
Isn't that too cruel?

21:23.950 --> 21:26.140
She let them beat her up.

21:29.620 --> 21:31.250
She thinks Du-ho's accident

21:31.680 --> 21:33.560
was because of her.

21:37.760 --> 21:38.760
Jenna.

21:38.970 --> 21:40.650
Please say something.

21:44.420 --> 21:46.960
Whatever she thinks, it's on her.

21:48.580 --> 21:49.860
Her thoughts are her own.

22:13.100 --> 22:14.400
To be a good agent

22:14.400 --> 22:16.190
for the successful Cotton Candy.

22:17.690 --> 22:19.980
So you all have to make it.

22:24.100 --> 22:25.360
I lost.

22:30.200 --> 22:32.120
I lost!

22:47.680 --> 22:49.590
Mom / Why aren't you picking up your phone?

22:49.590 --> 22:51.930
Ye-rin / I can't seem to reach you.

23:00.490 --> 23:03.940
Phone
Du-ho

23:03.970 --> 23:05.290
Du-ho

23:10.140 --> 23:12.360
Delete

23:12.390 --> 23:13.090
Move the contact info to trash

23:15.890 --> 23:17.090
Move the contact info to trash

23:17.110 --> 23:17.900
Move

23:33.210 --> 23:34.750
Delete messages

23:41.740 --> 23:44.260
Delete all

23:45.010 --> 23:46.410
Starpeace Asst. Manager Park

23:56.630 --> 23:57.630
Jenna!

24:00.750 --> 24:03.920
The new CEO asked to see us, but you said no?

24:03.920 --> 24:04.920
Yes.

24:06.560 --> 24:07.560
Why?

24:08.610 --> 24:11.340
He said he'd see our performance, then decide?

24:11.450 --> 24:13.130
That's what we wanted.

24:14.390 --> 24:16.460
It might be our last chance.

24:16.870 --> 24:18.660
We can do really well.

24:22.100 --> 24:23.780
I said it's all over.

24:25.540 --> 24:26.540
Stella.

24:27.170 --> 24:28.420
We're finished.

24:28.440 --> 24:29.270
Okay?

24:29.670 --> 24:30.670
Jenna.

24:32.020 --> 24:33.280
Don't be like this.

24:34.970 --> 24:36.650
You don't really mean that.

24:37.200 --> 24:38.200
I don't?

24:45.120 --> 24:46.120
I don't?

24:48.860 --> 24:50.250
I do mean it.

24:54.220 --> 24:55.690
I get it now.

25:00.200 --> 25:01.990
I guess I was possessed.

25:02.420 --> 25:03.710
I was blind

25:04.210 --> 25:05.420
and deaf.

25:05.830 --> 25:08.170
I can see now. I can hear it.

25:08.580 --> 25:11.250
The world pointing at us and mocking us.

25:15.570 --> 25:16.910
Listen. Huh?

25:17.200 --> 25:18.290
You can hear it, right?

25:18.980 --> 25:20.130
You can see it, right?

25:20.510 --> 25:22.020
Oh, right.

25:22.830 --> 25:24.320
You always heard.

25:25.180 --> 25:26.370
You always saw.

25:26.670 --> 25:28.920
You just couldn't say anything because of me.

25:29.100 --> 25:29.870
Jenna.

25:30.540 --> 25:31.310
What's wrong?

25:31.330 --> 25:33.470
If we try to do something again,

25:34.030 --> 25:36.950
this sound will grow louder.

25:37.450 --> 25:39.190
They'll be out for more blood.

25:39.420 --> 25:42.200
Why am I just realizing this now? Huh?

25:42.760 --> 25:44.040
Then Du-ho

25:45.900 --> 25:47.420
wouldn't have died.

25:47.910 --> 25:49.880
Jenna. Don't be like this.

25:50.320 --> 25:51.420
Don't be like this.

25:51.780 --> 25:53.520
Please don't be like this.

26:01.360 --> 26:02.760
I'm not insane.

26:05.150 --> 26:06.840
I'm as sane as ever.

26:08.690 --> 26:09.890
Let's not covet

26:10.970 --> 26:12.250
what's not ours.

26:14.980 --> 26:16.720
Let's each go our own way.

27:37.740 --> 27:40.710
Go!

27:41.410 --> 27:42.580
Just go!

27:43.060 --> 27:44.750
Just go, Du-ho!

27:44.750 --> 27:47.550
Leave!

29:14.750 --> 29:15.750
Don't...

29:16.940 --> 29:17.940
leave me.

29:29.050 --> 29:30.500
Du-ho's gone.

29:32.080 --> 29:34.420
Don't you leave me, too.

29:43.670 --> 29:45.740
I'm sorry, Du-ho.

29:46.550 --> 29:48.010
I'm sorry, Jenna.

29:49.640 --> 29:51.800
I'm sorry, everyone.

31:45.230 --> 31:47.270
Okay, like we're starting for the first time,

31:47.270 --> 31:48.390
let's do this!

31:48.420 --> 31:49.800
- Okay!
- Yay!

31:50.540 --> 31:51.930
This is mine.

31:52.160 --> 31:53.630
Okay!

31:53.660 --> 31:54.910
Take it quick.

31:55.090 --> 31:59.060
Can you feel this trembling?

31:59.170 --> 32:03.540
Do you feel the same way?

32:03.810 --> 32:08.620
Time has stopped as if I'm in a dream

32:09.840 --> 32:12.290
Is this love?

32:14.460 --> 32:17.790
I look around and lovers are everywhere

32:17.950 --> 32:22.100
I was sad that I was alone

32:23.650 --> 32:27.020
But I saw you by my side

32:27.260 --> 32:31.130
Now I realize

32:31.230 --> 32:33.710
Into my small world

32:33.710 --> 32:35.800
You came like a big gift

32:35.860 --> 32:37.440
In a sparkling moment

32:37.440 --> 32:40.760
My white first love came to me

32:41.290 --> 32:43.410
Worried you might read my heart

32:43.610 --> 32:46.740
or how much I've been waiting for today

32:46.930 --> 32:49.960
I want your white day love

33:08.800 --> 33:10.890
Imagining you and me walking together

33:10.890 --> 33:13.280
My cheeks blush as if I found happiness

33:13.280 --> 33:14.970
Even though the path we're walking on

33:14.970 --> 33:16.120
Is different for a while

33:16.120 --> 33:18.050
Let's hold hands tightly and walk together

33:18.050 --> 33:20.120
We're going to be a pretty couple

33:20.250 --> 33:23.500
I'll be your only lover

33:23.680 --> 33:26.490
Come closer to me

33:28.230 --> 33:29.580
Tiring days and repetitive daily lives

33:29.580 --> 33:30.280
Yes.

33:30.400 --> 33:32.240
Leave me out on all the roles this week.

33:32.680 --> 33:34.230
No. For the whole week.

33:34.410 --> 33:36.130
Yes. I'm sorry.

33:36.640 --> 33:37.480
Whoa.

33:38.200 --> 33:39.580
Aren't you going overboard?

33:43.720 --> 33:44.790
It's determination.

33:46.400 --> 33:48.060
Isn't Stella going overboard?

33:48.550 --> 33:50.100
This way, we're complete.

33:50.100 --> 33:51.210
Like when we began.

34:00.290 --> 34:01.970
We're not complete yet.

34:07.160 --> 34:08.840
It's our last chance.

34:22.130 --> 34:23.810
Is it really the last?

34:29.850 --> 34:31.650
They could be giving us false hope.

34:32.389 --> 34:34.070
I won't let that happen.

34:35.290 --> 34:36.290
Me neither.

34:37.710 --> 34:38.710
Me neither.

34:41.190 --> 34:42.090
Me neither.

34:45.980 --> 34:47.360
If we don't make it this time,

34:48.070 --> 34:49.199
we're letting it go.

34:49.199 --> 34:51.469
- We'll make it!
- We'll make it!

34:52.320 --> 34:54.530
Come on, Elle. We'll make it!

34:55.420 --> 34:56.630
I have a suggestion.

34:56.770 --> 34:57.960
Our performance.

34:57.960 --> 35:00.150
Instead of "White Day," let's do "Honest."

35:00.680 --> 35:01.720
Jenna's song.

35:02.560 --> 35:03.600
That's great!

35:03.750 --> 35:05.960
We pushed that as the title song at first.

35:05.960 --> 35:06.810
Yeah.

35:07.240 --> 35:08.240
I agree.

35:08.820 --> 35:09.820
Me, too!

35:10.040 --> 35:11.110
The choreography...

35:11.630 --> 35:12.830
Leave it to me.

35:19.150 --> 35:22.600
If. I'm. Honest.

35:22.750 --> 35:23.500
And...

35:23.500 --> 35:24.290
One.

35:24.290 --> 35:24.920
Two.

35:24.920 --> 35:26.380
And swoosh!

35:26.400 --> 35:27.000
Swoosh!

35:27.030 --> 35:28.220
More this way. Like this.

35:28.220 --> 35:30.060
- Point to yourself, then bam!
- Bam!

35:30.100 --> 35:31.870
In my dream last night

35:31.900 --> 35:35.510
Our whispers as we met again

35:38.100 --> 35:40.100
There are no more

35:40.100 --> 35:43.780
Lies I made up

35:44.490 --> 35:46.040
I don't know who I am

35:47.010 --> 35:47.600
Again!

35:47.600 --> 35:48.640
Again, again!

35:48.800 --> 35:50.630
The line didn't match here. Make it straight.

35:50.660 --> 35:51.380
Fight on!

35:51.380 --> 35:52.380
This way.

35:52.520 --> 35:54.080
- Here, too.
- Okay.

35:54.130 --> 35:55.420
Go forward.

35:55.910 --> 35:57.400
Twist your wrist.

35:57.880 --> 35:59.990
- Swish and bang!
- Swish and bang!

36:01.330 --> 36:04.150
Ooh If I'm honest

36:04.350 --> 36:06.930
Tell me if you're thinking the same thing

36:07.790 --> 36:08.990
What you wanted

36:10.050 --> 36:12.110
Lost then found me

36:12.470 --> 36:14.930
You saw me in this strange world

36:15.810 --> 36:16.900
It was you

36:18.100 --> 36:20.090
The hope in my fluttering heart

36:20.110 --> 36:22.440
Fills up with love

36:22.620 --> 36:23.740
I'm exhausted.

36:26.100 --> 36:27.920
It is now clear

36:27.920 --> 36:30.380
The story only I didn't know

36:30.450 --> 36:32.990
Don't wanna feel it if it's without ya

36:33.580 --> 36:34.820
If I'm honest

36:37.620 --> 36:39.030
If I'm honest

36:39.570 --> 36:40.850
If I'm honest

36:42.030 --> 36:44.530
Hiding behind fear

36:44.530 --> 36:47.530
I closed up my heart

36:50.030 --> 36:52.510
Within that, you are my bloom

36:52.510 --> 36:55.550
The first snow on a summer night

36:56.510 --> 36:58.030
Oh, it's amazing

36:58.100 --> 37:02.110
I knew the answer, but I always lost my way

37:02.490 --> 37:04.520
I didn't want it to be true

37:06.080 --> 37:10.080
Under the twinkling star, we were dark

37:10.550 --> 37:12.440
What do you think about us?

37:13.320 --> 37:16.210
Ooh If I'm honest

37:16.380 --> 37:18.950
Tell me if you're thinking the same thing

37:19.770 --> 37:20.860
What you wanted

37:21.780 --> 37:24.470
Jeez. Can't we have some dressing?

37:25.110 --> 37:26.840
No. You'll gain weight.

37:28.280 --> 37:29.720
Eat your tomatoes.

37:31.540 --> 37:32.750
I can't eat this.

37:32.750 --> 37:34.160
I'm not going to eat.

37:35.530 --> 37:36.810
Where are you going?

37:37.960 --> 37:38.560
Huh?

37:38.560 --> 37:39.010
Hey!

37:39.010 --> 37:40.290
Hey, Oh Hyun-ji!

37:40.320 --> 37:42.020
Hey! Wake up!

37:42.090 --> 37:42.870
- Hey!
- Hyun-ji!

37:42.870 --> 37:44.220
- Are you okay?
- Hey!

37:51.560 --> 37:52.270
Okay!

37:52.270 --> 37:53.310
- Let's begin.
- Stella.

37:53.470 --> 37:54.930
You ate something good, didn't you?

37:54.930 --> 37:56.310
No.

37:56.500 --> 37:58.060
Come one. Let's go!

37:58.060 --> 37:59.650
- Okay!
- Let's do this!

37:59.650 --> 38:01.460
In my dream last night

38:01.460 --> 38:05.140
Our whispers as we met again

38:07.560 --> 38:09.660
There are no more

38:09.660 --> 38:13.260
Lies I said alone

38:14.010 --> 38:15.600
I don't know who I am

38:15.600 --> 38:19.660
I knew the answer, but I always lost my way

38:20.100 --> 38:22.180
I didn't want it to be true

38:23.610 --> 38:27.660
Under the twinkling star, the compass was dark

38:28.030 --> 38:30.010
What do you feel?

38:30.880 --> 38:33.790
Ooh If I'm honest

38:33.910 --> 38:36.300
Tell me if you're thinking the same thing

38:37.310 --> 38:38.510
What you wanted

38:39.410 --> 38:41.650
Lost then found me

38:42.010 --> 38:44.400
You saw me in this strange world

38:45.320 --> 38:46.390
It was you

38:47.610 --> 38:49.590
The hope in my fluttering heart

38:49.590 --> 38:51.840
Fills up with love

38:55.600 --> 38:57.510
It is now clear

38:57.510 --> 38:59.770
The story only I didn't know

38:59.950 --> 39:02.490
Don't wanna feel it if it's without ya

39:03.090 --> 39:04.430
If I'm honest

39:07.080 --> 39:08.710
If I'm honest

39:11.210 --> 39:12.260
It's perfect!

39:13.180 --> 39:14.690
This is great! We did great!

39:19.180 --> 39:20.050
We didn't make a mistake?

39:20.080 --> 39:21.280
We got everything right!

39:21.300 --> 39:23.300
I did it! I did it!

39:24.040 --> 39:25.720
I can't believe this!

39:26.470 --> 39:28.150
Let's do it like this.

39:28.180 --> 39:29.260
Just like this.

39:30.700 --> 39:31.750
I'm exhausted.

39:33.340 --> 39:34.340
A test?

39:34.640 --> 39:35.640
Yes.

39:35.990 --> 39:38.720
He'll see their performance, then decide.

39:38.980 --> 39:40.710
I guess he's not that cold-blooded.

39:41.910 --> 39:43.310
You're all being deceived.

39:43.310 --> 39:45.400
He said if they have 1% potential,

39:45.500 --> 39:46.480
he'll give them a chance.

39:46.480 --> 39:48.940
He uses words differently from normal people.

39:49.070 --> 39:50.070
What?

39:50.900 --> 39:52.100
I told you.

39:52.800 --> 39:54.000
He's perverted.

39:54.650 --> 39:55.650
Wait.

39:55.920 --> 39:57.720
Hey! Where are you going?

39:59.590 --> 40:00.800
- It's a 10 minute break.
- Okay.

40:00.800 --> 40:02.630
- Use the bathroom in 5 minutes.
- Okay.

40:03.090 --> 40:04.400
I'm exhausted.

40:04.890 --> 40:05.970
My stomach is in stitches.

40:06.130 --> 40:07.130
Oh, no.

40:10.060 --> 40:11.810
- Hello.
- Hello.

40:16.380 --> 40:17.830
Why are you so docile?

40:17.990 --> 40:19.430
He's our lifeline.

40:19.790 --> 40:22.890
I have enough sense to be meek to the powerful.

40:23.530 --> 40:24.770
Jeez.

40:25.130 --> 40:26.280
You're so cute.

40:26.350 --> 40:28.320
I felt sorry for them.

40:28.350 --> 40:29.990
But now I'm put off by them.

40:29.990 --> 40:31.810
I guess they don't feel bad about Du-ho.

40:31.810 --> 40:33.370
How can they be here?

40:33.370 --> 40:35.270
How can they dance and sing?

40:35.300 --> 40:37.290
That won't help them succeed.

40:37.290 --> 40:38.910
- If they were to, they would've ages ago.
- That trash!

40:38.910 --> 40:41.410
Hyun-ji! Let's ignore them.

40:41.640 --> 40:42.640
It's okay.

40:43.670 --> 40:45.350
Okay, okay, okay, okay!

40:46.240 --> 40:47.420
We have 8 minutes left.

40:47.630 --> 40:49.370
We prepared a stage in the Art Hall.

40:49.390 --> 40:52.470
I told all available staff to come tomorrow.

40:52.780 --> 40:54.750
But why are you going this far?

40:55.570 --> 40:56.790
If you leave them alone,

40:56.790 --> 40:58.600
they'll disperse naturally.

40:59.060 --> 41:00.740
Why make it a big deal?

41:01.590 --> 41:02.710
Director Yoon!

41:02.750 --> 41:05.020
Business Report
Art Hall Stage Setting for Cotton Candy

41:03.240 --> 41:04.240
Hi.

41:05.050 --> 41:06.060
CEO

41:06.410 --> 41:08.040
Give them a stylist, too.

41:08.040 --> 41:09.680
Do their hair and makeup properly.

41:10.210 --> 41:11.890
Good for Cotton Candy!

41:12.000 --> 41:13.520
Okay. I'll do that.

41:20.390 --> 41:21.520
Darn it.

41:28.880 --> 41:30.150
Darn it.

41:31.250 --> 41:32.770
What's your scheme?

41:33.840 --> 41:34.840
Scheme?

41:36.060 --> 41:37.860
Is it the 1% project again?

41:38.240 --> 41:39.150
What's it to you?

41:39.150 --> 41:40.030
You know them well?

41:40.030 --> 41:40.740
No.

41:40.740 --> 41:41.680
Related?

41:41.680 --> 41:42.680
No.

41:44.020 --> 41:45.810
Do they have something on you?

41:45.890 --> 41:47.950
Stop beating around the bush.

41:48.590 --> 41:49.720
Tell me your intentions.

41:49.720 --> 41:51.310
I gave them a chance.

41:51.310 --> 41:53.520
Seizing it is up to them.

41:53.710 --> 41:56.050
What you say is the same as before.

41:56.740 --> 41:59.340
You're not trying to see if they have potential.

41:59.700 --> 42:01.270
Your nature that wants to prove

42:01.270 --> 42:03.470
they don't even have 1% potential

42:04.250 --> 42:05.550
is the same, right?

42:09.310 --> 42:11.040
Look here, Seo Ji-han.

42:11.080 --> 42:12.220
My nature?

42:12.700 --> 42:15.960
Think of it as getting rid of their respirator.

42:21.740 --> 42:24.460
You forgot your failed scheme is here. Me.

42:24.820 --> 42:28.110
You still can't admit you're a quack.

42:29.050 --> 42:31.320
You'll never apologize.

42:32.950 --> 42:35.000
So I'll just have to curse you till I die.

43:08.860 --> 43:09.860
I guess

43:10.550 --> 43:12.720
that's why he told us to give it a go.

43:13.930 --> 43:14.930
Jenna.

43:15.750 --> 43:17.620
I don't think we'll make it.

43:27.680 --> 43:28.840
A while ago,

43:30.980 --> 43:33.880
I saw an unknown singers' competition on TV.

43:36.510 --> 43:40.260
A singer who had 20 soundtrack albums said this.

43:41.260 --> 43:43.400
"I was born in a recording booth

43:44.380 --> 43:46.590
and grew up in a recording booth."

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
Then

43:52.830 --> 43:54.720
something hot rose up

43:56.910 --> 43:58.000
inside me.

44:01.420 --> 44:02.420
We...

44:06.270 --> 44:09.470
We also were growing up in a booth called failure.

44:10.830 --> 44:12.990
We were turning into adults in here.

44:14.780 --> 44:17.880
Realizing that, I felt suffocated.

44:21.210 --> 44:23.760
I don't want to become an adult in here.

44:25.680 --> 44:27.120
I want to get out.

44:29.170 --> 44:30.610
Whatever I become,

44:30.820 --> 44:33.140
I want to grow up outside this booth.

44:35.290 --> 44:36.290
But

44:37.670 --> 44:39.070
we got stuck in here

44:40.080 --> 44:41.430
at such a young age.

44:43.170 --> 44:44.910
We were here for too long.

44:46.170 --> 44:48.360
So we don't know how to get out.

44:49.580 --> 44:51.620
We don't know if we can.

44:52.780 --> 44:55.580
We don't know what to do if we do.

44:56.160 --> 44:57.160
Jenna.

44:57.600 --> 44:59.210
In this test,

44:59.620 --> 45:01.070
I don't hope for much.

45:04.760 --> 45:07.250
"You have the right to get out of this booth!"

45:09.320 --> 45:10.950
That's all I want to hear.

45:11.720 --> 45:12.720
But

45:13.530 --> 45:16.600
if it's just to confirm that we must

45:16.620 --> 45:18.550
stay in this booth forever...

45:22.430 --> 45:23.430
Chae-ah.

45:27.120 --> 45:28.810
It won't go his way.

45:29.740 --> 45:31.140
He'll find out

45:32.790 --> 45:34.230
who he's up against.

45:40.350 --> 45:41.350
Come here.

45:55.020 --> 45:56.020
I guess

45:56.880 --> 45:59.040
that's why he told us to give it a go.

45:59.670 --> 46:00.670
Jenna.

46:01.210 --> 46:02.910
I don't think we'll make it.

46:04.120 --> 46:07.160
If it's just to confirm that we must

46:07.160 --> 46:09.090
stay in this booth forever...

46:47.570 --> 46:48.860
Muster up strength.

46:49.810 --> 46:51.010
Just this once.

47:31.180 --> 47:31.940
Hi, Jenna!

47:31.970 --> 47:32.630
Hello.

47:32.650 --> 47:33.650
How do you feel?

47:34.260 --> 47:35.260
Good.

47:36.180 --> 47:38.520
Thank you, Asst. Manager Park

47:39.020 --> 47:40.700
for thinking of us.

47:41.080 --> 47:42.360
Actually, CEO Ma

47:43.100 --> 47:45.570
was going to give you another chance.

47:46.090 --> 47:47.090
What?

47:50.190 --> 47:51.850
Right before he passed away,

47:52.900 --> 47:55.650
he talked about plans for your second album.

48:01.560 --> 48:03.140
Good luck with the performance.

48:04.710 --> 48:06.380
Tell Hyun-ji to keep her temper.

48:06.450 --> 48:07.890
Encourage Chae-ah.

48:08.930 --> 48:10.450
As always, do well.

48:12.440 --> 48:14.170
See you when you get back.

48:46.090 --> 48:47.360
With the delay,

48:47.360 --> 48:48.890
the settlement money is

48:48.950 --> 48:51.280
KRW 245 million. Yeah.

49:03.860 --> 49:05.930
You don't have all the members?

49:05.980 --> 49:06.980
Don't worry.

49:07.180 --> 49:10.320
I have the second best looking member in the bag.

49:12.020 --> 49:13.190
She lives in Tongyeong.

49:13.190 --> 49:15.260
Let's go before someone else gets her.

49:18.240 --> 49:19.440
Me, too?

49:21.350 --> 49:22.300
Oh, well.

49:22.300 --> 49:23.740
I went several times.

49:23.820 --> 49:25.700
But she reported me as a con man.

49:25.740 --> 49:26.780
Jenna!

49:27.370 --> 49:28.380
Jenna!

49:29.630 --> 49:30.630
Hey.

49:30.850 --> 49:33.260
Seo Yu-mi's daughter wants to join our team.

49:33.970 --> 49:35.690
The actress Seo Yu-mi?

49:35.690 --> 49:38.000
Yeah. Her dream was to become an idol singer.

49:38.000 --> 49:38.800
So

49:38.850 --> 49:40.280
she made a lot of effort.

49:40.440 --> 49:43.760
But Seo Yu-mi is vehemently against it.

49:44.310 --> 49:46.540
So let's go together and talk to her.

49:46.540 --> 49:47.940
- Me, too?
- Let's go!

49:51.010 --> 49:53.910
This is Hyun-ji from the orphanage.

49:55.340 --> 49:56.560
Is she candidate No.4?

49:56.560 --> 49:58.950
She says she'll only join a major agency.

49:59.910 --> 50:00.910
Jenna.

50:01.780 --> 50:03.370
Let's go together and persuade her.

50:04.090 --> 50:05.700
She scares me.

50:05.980 --> 50:06.900
Jenna!

50:07.590 --> 50:08.540
Jenna!

50:09.060 --> 50:10.060
Excuse me.

50:11.910 --> 50:12.910
I found us

50:13.700 --> 50:14.700
our main

50:14.930 --> 50:15.930
vocalist!

50:32.620 --> 50:34.300
What do you think, Jenna?

50:36.470 --> 50:38.850
About my skills in starting from scratch?

50:42.820 --> 50:45.550
The whole world mocked me,

50:46.300 --> 50:47.980
saying I was a nobody.

50:51.280 --> 50:52.280
See?

50:53.950 --> 50:55.180
We did it.

51:12.940 --> 51:13.940
What the?

51:18.130 --> 51:19.810
Go inside or step aside.

51:23.400 --> 51:24.580
I'm sorry.

51:26.540 --> 51:28.230
I didn't tell you to step back.

51:29.680 --> 51:31.750
Do you always not listen to others?

51:32.560 --> 51:33.560
I'm sorry.

51:35.380 --> 51:36.740
Why are you here?

51:36.880 --> 51:37.880
Oh, well...

51:40.040 --> 51:41.370
I'll tell you this now.

51:41.950 --> 51:44.660
Requests, bribes, appeals, excuses, sob-stories...

51:44.660 --> 51:46.690
They're all things that I hate.

51:46.870 --> 51:48.840
I hate it when the talk gets long.

51:51.100 --> 51:52.100
Here...

52:00.190 --> 52:01.120
Thank you.

52:02.820 --> 52:04.980
I hope you see our performance well.

52:05.040 --> 52:06.570
That's also a request.

52:06.790 --> 52:08.850
I'm asking you to be fair.

52:09.410 --> 52:11.420
No prejudgment or prejudice.

52:13.550 --> 52:14.550
Okay.

52:16.400 --> 52:17.390
You can go now.

52:17.830 --> 52:18.640
Okay.

52:29.630 --> 52:32.530
CEO Cha must be humane unlike the rumors I heard.

52:32.640 --> 52:34.210
The stage is so proper.

52:34.300 --> 52:36.570
It's a test, but he had a whole stage set up.

52:56.260 --> 52:57.700
By the way,

52:58.400 --> 53:00.010
he looks so good in a suit.

53:00.380 --> 53:01.860
That's a killer look.

53:08.990 --> 53:09.990
Oh!

53:11.010 --> 53:12.010
That...

53:12.340 --> 53:15.280
It's what CEO Ma bought us the day we debuted.

53:15.600 --> 53:17.590
I want to show CEO Ma.

53:24.930 --> 53:25.930
Me, too.

53:28.510 --> 53:29.970
Seriously.

53:31.450 --> 53:32.850
He said he'll buy us a diamond ring

53:32.850 --> 53:33.940
when we succeeded.

53:34.100 --> 53:36.840
He made promises and just left like that.

53:47.780 --> 53:48.780
Cot!

53:51.450 --> 53:52.450
Ten!

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
Can!

53:55.060 --> 53:56.060
Dy!

53:57.780 --> 53:58.900
Let's do this!

54:28.380 --> 54:31.060
- Huh? You're here to watch?
- Hi.

54:32.470 --> 54:33.330
Hey.

54:33.760 --> 54:35.050
Why are you here?

54:36.110 --> 54:38.250
You said all available staff to come.

54:39.200 --> 54:41.130
If you're bored, go practice.

54:41.290 --> 54:42.990
I heard Bbiyong gave you a new song.

54:58.460 --> 55:00.280
In my dream last night

55:00.280 --> 55:03.920
Our whispers as we met again

55:05.430 --> 55:06.440
"Honest"?

55:06.440 --> 55:08.510
There are no more

55:08.510 --> 55:12.130
Lies I made up

55:12.870 --> 55:14.470
I don't know who I am

55:14.510 --> 55:18.460
I knew the answer, but I always lost my way

55:18.920 --> 55:20.970
I didn't want it to be true

55:22.420 --> 55:26.500
Under the twinkling star, the compass was dark

55:26.930 --> 55:29.050
What do you feel?

55:29.660 --> 55:32.730
Ooh If I'm honest

55:32.750 --> 55:35.230
Tell me if you're thinking the same thing

55:36.170 --> 55:37.370
What you wanted

55:38.240 --> 55:40.690
Lost then found me

55:40.850 --> 55:43.240
You saw me in this strange world

55:44.190 --> 55:45.310
It was you

55:46.470 --> 55:48.480
The hope in my fluttering heart

55:48.480 --> 55:50.700
Fills up with love

55:52.580 --> 55:53.620
They're good!

55:54.450 --> 55:56.320
It is now clear

55:56.320 --> 55:58.680
The story only I didn't know

55:58.840 --> 56:01.300
Don't wanna feel it if it's without ya

56:01.970 --> 56:03.190
If I'm honest

56:06.050 --> 56:07.550
If I'm honest

56:07.970 --> 56:09.220
If I'm honest

56:10.450 --> 56:12.900
Hiding behind fear

56:12.900 --> 56:15.940
I closed up my heart

56:18.460 --> 56:20.890
Within that, you are my bloom

56:20.890 --> 56:23.890
The first snow on a summer night

56:24.900 --> 56:26.440
Oh, it's amazing

56:26.880 --> 56:28.770
Hey! They're a total surprise!

56:29.530 --> 56:31.990
They put their everything into this.

56:34.430 --> 56:38.530
Under the twinkling star, we were dark

56:38.920 --> 56:40.910
What do you think about us?

56:40.970 --> 56:41.580
Right!

56:41.580 --> 56:44.240
That expression was Stella's trademark.

56:44.470 --> 56:45.340
I had forgotten.

56:45.370 --> 56:46.480
She's so pretty.

56:48.160 --> 56:49.360
What you wanted

56:50.470 --> 56:52.490
Lost then found me

56:52.850 --> 56:55.260
You saw me in this strange world

56:56.170 --> 56:57.260
It was you

56:58.480 --> 57:00.460
The hope in my fluttering heart

57:00.460 --> 57:02.580
Fills up with love

57:06.490 --> 57:08.350
It is now clear

57:08.350 --> 57:10.650
The story only I didn't know

57:10.750 --> 57:13.380
Don't wanna feel it if it's without ya

57:13.940 --> 57:15.250
If I'm honest

57:19.950 --> 57:21.180
If I'm honest

57:25.840 --> 57:28.170
Was that sequence originally there?

57:28.320 --> 57:29.780
No, it wasn't.

57:30.000 --> 57:31.760
I think she put it in because she's good at it.

57:31.780 --> 57:34.310
But it doesn't go with this song, does it?

57:34.340 --> 57:36.160
That's why they need an agency.

57:36.160 --> 57:38.380
We can tone down these things.

57:38.480 --> 57:40.430
Lost then found me

57:40.830 --> 57:43.330
I saw you in this strange world

57:44.200 --> 57:45.340
Trust me

57:46.470 --> 57:48.480
The hope in my fluttering heart

57:48.480 --> 57:50.720
Fills up with love

57:54.470 --> 57:56.310
It is now clear

57:56.310 --> 57:58.530
The story only I didn't know

57:58.790 --> 58:01.320
Don't wanna feel it if it's without ya

58:01.950 --> 58:03.210
If I'm honest

58:05.960 --> 58:07.470
If I'm honest

58:23.230 --> 58:25.030
They did such a good job!

59:04.160 --> 59:05.120
Yeah.

59:41.910 --> 59:42.910
You did well.

59:43.540 --> 59:46.450
It was worth the practice.

59:46.650 --> 59:48.450
Thank you!

59:50.720 --> 59:52.000
Well, then.

59:53.340 --> 59:54.510
Did you all have fun?

59:54.510 --> 59:55.890
Yes!

59:57.860 --> 59:58.860
Good.

59:59.630 --> 1:00:00.860
Okay, then.

1:00:01.530 --> 1:00:02.830
How much

1:00:04.400 --> 1:00:06.930
do you think this group will earn us?

1:00:17.740 --> 1:00:18.860
Director Yoon!

1:00:20.110 --> 1:00:21.180
Speak.

1:00:21.510 --> 1:00:23.220
How much do you think Cotton Candy

1:00:23.220 --> 1:00:24.900
will earn for Starpeace?

1:00:26.250 --> 1:00:29.190
This is sudden. I don't know what to say.

1:00:30.690 --> 1:00:34.060
If we newly package Cotton Candy,

1:00:34.060 --> 1:00:36.140
those who think we'll pass the break-even point

1:00:36.140 --> 1:00:37.160
within a year,

1:00:37.630 --> 1:00:38.900
raise your hand.

1:00:54.280 --> 1:00:57.480
If even one person can responsibly guarantee that,

1:00:57.920 --> 1:01:01.290
this group will remain as Starpeace's artist.

1:01:10.830 --> 1:01:11.830
No one?

1:01:14.770 --> 1:01:15.970
Not even one?

1:01:22.970 --> 1:01:23.970
Me!

1:01:32.280 --> 1:01:33.400
Director Yoon!

1:01:33.520 --> 1:01:34.390
Yes?

1:01:34.390 --> 1:01:38.460
Is Seo Ji-han a staff member of Starpeace?

1:01:39.120 --> 1:01:40.260
No.

1:01:43.430 --> 1:01:45.760
You promised!

1:01:47.270 --> 1:01:49.170
To be fair!

1:01:58.610 --> 1:02:00.310
We did really well.

1:02:01.450 --> 1:02:03.320
You saw the response.

1:02:03.320 --> 1:02:04.520
You did do well.

1:02:04.520 --> 1:02:05.080
Then?

1:02:05.080 --> 1:02:07.190
Whether you're a good product is different.

1:02:08.090 --> 1:02:09.990
Everyone is saying that.

1:02:12.260 --> 1:02:15.990
You were unable to persuade

1:02:15.990 --> 1:02:17.830
even one person here.

1:02:28.470 --> 1:02:30.410
I can't accept this.

1:02:32.410 --> 1:02:34.380
Look me in the eye

1:02:34.750 --> 1:02:36.750
and tell me we're not competent.

1:02:36.750 --> 1:02:37.850
Say it.

1:02:38.950 --> 1:02:40.490
You are competent.

1:02:43.420 --> 1:02:44.760
You're just not appealing.

1:02:50.100 --> 1:02:52.330
Practicing night and day to get the perfect moves

1:02:52.330 --> 1:02:54.430
and singing with excellent vocal skills

1:02:55.100 --> 1:02:56.770
don't make you an appealing team.

1:02:56.770 --> 1:02:57.770
Furthermore,

1:02:58.040 --> 1:03:01.440
the stage, hair, makeup and costume were the best.

1:03:02.570 --> 1:03:03.910
But you couldn't provide more than

1:03:03.910 --> 1:03:05.380
momentary entertainment.

1:03:05.380 --> 1:03:06.810
That's enough!

1:03:21.230 --> 1:03:24.230
It means you don't even have a 1% potential.

1:03:30.970 --> 1:03:32.360
You crook!

1:03:32.360 --> 1:03:33.120
Hyun-ji...

1:03:33.150 --> 1:03:35.840
This is why I told you to give up.

1:03:35.840 --> 1:03:38.010
You wanted to end up like this?

1:03:38.280 --> 1:03:41.410
The remaining contract period is meaningless.

1:03:41.410 --> 1:03:43.620
I want this sorted as soon as possible.

1:03:43.620 --> 1:03:45.880
I'll compensate according to your contract.

1:03:46.150 --> 1:03:47.590
Okay.

1:03:50.160 --> 1:03:51.260
Jenna.

1:03:54.560 --> 1:03:55.730
You're firing us.

1:03:56.460 --> 1:03:58.030
I'll accept that.

1:03:59.400 --> 1:04:01.070
But let us

1:04:01.530 --> 1:04:03.870
leave with our name, Cotton Candy.

1:04:10.440 --> 1:04:11.640
Director Yoon!

1:04:12.510 --> 1:04:12.910
Yes?

1:04:12.910 --> 1:04:14.270
Is that possible?

1:04:14.510 --> 1:04:15.850
Is there precedent?

1:04:16.180 --> 1:04:17.750
The team name is a trademark right.

1:04:17.750 --> 1:04:18.650
An asset of the company.

1:04:18.650 --> 1:04:23.050
But Starpeace doesn't need Cotton Candy.

1:04:23.150 --> 1:04:24.420
We can't become a precedent.

1:04:24.420 --> 1:04:25.420
Director Yoon!

1:04:25.420 --> 1:04:27.130
Don't say such idiotic crap!

1:04:27.130 --> 1:04:28.190
Hyun-ji! Come on.

1:04:28.190 --> 1:04:29.730
Stop speak so roughly.

1:04:29.730 --> 1:04:31.460
You guys started it!

1:04:31.460 --> 1:04:32.430
Hyun-ji! Come on.

1:04:32.430 --> 1:04:34.330
Take her away.

1:04:37.240 --> 1:04:38.240
You heard, right?

1:04:38.500 --> 1:04:39.670
No.

1:04:40.810 --> 1:04:42.910
Then give us 3 months.

1:04:43.980 --> 1:04:46.780
Jenna! What will you do in 3 months?

1:04:47.310 --> 1:04:48.850
We won't be fired.

1:04:50.820 --> 1:04:52.220
We'll disband.

1:04:56.590 --> 1:04:59.820
But where and how

1:04:59.820 --> 1:05:02.030
will be decided by us.

1:05:05.400 --> 1:05:07.700
Are you going to hold a press conference?

1:05:08.370 --> 1:05:10.400
We'll be No.1 in a music TV show,

1:05:10.400 --> 1:05:12.840
then announce that we're disbanding.

1:05:23.750 --> 1:05:25.150
What's up with her?

1:05:25.150 --> 1:05:26.690
She must be crazy.

1:05:26.950 --> 1:05:28.320
Kim Jenna...

1:05:29.420 --> 1:05:31.020
What are you thinking?

1:05:33.990 --> 1:05:35.830
Why is she doing this?

1:05:38.200 --> 1:05:39.880
I think you're in shock.

1:05:40.570 --> 1:05:42.130
Go get some rest.

1:05:43.070 --> 1:05:45.300
Then we'll take our name and leave!

1:05:49.840 --> 1:05:50.740
No!

1:05:50.740 --> 1:05:52.280
Then give us 3 months.

1:05:52.280 --> 1:05:53.210
No!

1:05:53.210 --> 1:05:55.180
Why do you keep saying no?

1:05:55.180 --> 1:05:56.180
Since you're speaking nonsense!

1:05:56.180 --> 1:05:58.080
Why is it nonsense?

1:05:58.080 --> 1:05:59.780
Remove your foot first!

1:06:07.160 --> 1:06:09.260
Why can't you give us

1:06:09.260 --> 1:06:11.260
that short time?

1:06:11.260 --> 1:06:12.730
Why, why, why!

1:06:13.230 --> 1:06:15.330
Stop asking why. Okay?

1:06:17.170 --> 1:06:18.900
About the breach of contract...

1:06:18.900 --> 1:06:20.740
I'll fight you with everything I have.

1:06:21.140 --> 1:06:22.810
You have no chance of winning!

1:06:22.810 --> 1:06:23.980
I don't care.

1:06:23.980 --> 1:06:25.240
I've been labeled as a failed idol singer.

1:06:25.240 --> 1:06:26.680
A few years is nothing.

1:06:26.680 --> 1:06:28.710
You say time is money. I'll drag you down

1:06:28.710 --> 1:06:31.080
and take you on a long dirty fight in court.

1:06:31.080 --> 1:06:32.750
I have all the time in the world.

1:06:32.750 --> 1:06:34.090
And you'll find out soon enough,

1:06:34.490 --> 1:06:35.990
but I am very

1:06:35.990 --> 1:06:37.620
persistent.

1:06:41.360 --> 1:06:43.560
Our Jenna is a fighter.

1:06:45.800 --> 1:06:46.500
What are you doing?

1:06:46.500 --> 1:06:47.630
Villain.

1:06:48.870 --> 1:06:50.500
Can she do that?

1:07:00.550 --> 1:07:01.610
Okay.

1:07:02.180 --> 1:07:04.880
Prove that you're worth receiving 3 months' time.

1:07:05.180 --> 1:07:05.980
How?

1:07:05.980 --> 1:07:07.290
In 3 days,

1:07:07.950 --> 1:07:09.750
become so famous that people forget

1:07:09.750 --> 1:07:11.260
you were labeled a failed idol singer.

1:07:14.930 --> 1:07:16.060
I told you.

1:07:16.830 --> 1:07:18.060
He's perverted.

1:07:20.570 --> 1:07:21.700
What's the criteria?

1:07:22.070 --> 1:07:23.330
Director Yoon!

1:07:23.840 --> 1:07:24.740
Yes?

1:07:25.200 --> 1:07:27.570
There's a famous entertainment journalist, right?

1:07:27.570 --> 1:07:29.250
Entertainment journalist?

1:07:31.180 --> 1:07:32.180
Mo Ga...?

1:07:33.080 --> 1:07:34.450
Oh, Reporter Mo Ga-jin...

1:07:34.450 --> 1:07:36.350
He's a slight wacko.

1:07:36.350 --> 1:07:38.520
Make him stalk you!

1:07:41.250 --> 1:07:42.290
Sir.

1:07:42.820 --> 1:07:44.820
He won't even see you if you're not a top star.

1:07:44.820 --> 1:07:46.020
Precisely.

1:07:52.330 --> 1:07:53.600
It's 3 days.

1:07:55.070 --> 1:07:57.040
If you can't do it in 3 days,

1:07:57.900 --> 1:07:59.440
you'll leave, stripped of everything.

1:08:00.740 --> 1:08:01.740
Okay?

1:08:02.240 --> 1:08:03.270
Okay!

1:08:22.040 --> 1:08:23.430
What's with her?

1:08:23.430 --> 1:08:25.359
Jenna, why are you doing this?

1:08:25.359 --> 1:08:26.430
Yeah, Jenna.

1:08:26.430 --> 1:08:28.700
Why are you doing this? Huh? Why?

1:08:28.970 --> 1:08:31.540
Director Yoon, you traitor!

1:08:32.200 --> 1:08:32.939
Hyun-ji.

1:08:32.939 --> 1:08:36.069
I was never on your side.

1:08:36.270 --> 1:08:37.630
How could you side with

1:08:37.630 --> 1:08:39.850
a stone that just rolled in?

1:08:39.880 --> 1:08:42.580
We were here before you!

1:08:42.580 --> 1:08:45.620
We made this agency, you filthy traitor!

1:08:48.020 --> 1:08:49.290
I'm old enough to be your uncle.

1:08:49.290 --> 1:08:52.189
Don't be so rude in front of others!

1:08:52.260 --> 1:08:55.060
Uncle? Uncle, my foot!

1:08:55.060 --> 1:08:56.560
I'm an orphan!

1:09:02.800 --> 1:09:04.270
- Hold me.
- Okay.

1:09:04.870 --> 1:09:05.870
Let's go.

1:09:43.740 --> 1:09:45.439
What's this? A change of players?

1:09:45.439 --> 1:09:46.479
I have something to say.

1:09:46.479 --> 1:09:47.880
I have nothing to hear!

1:09:47.880 --> 1:09:50.010
CEO Ma said when he disbands us,

1:09:50.279 --> 1:09:52.580
he'll leave me on as a solo artist.

1:09:53.520 --> 1:09:56.350
He said that because I'm worth it as a solo act.

1:09:57.190 --> 1:09:58.620
I hope you can

1:10:00.120 --> 1:10:01.960
consider that.

1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:07.030
I can see for sure why your team

1:10:07.230 --> 1:10:08.930
didn't work out.

1:10:14.740 --> 1:10:15.740
Elle.

1:10:19.080 --> 1:10:23.920
I like selfish and ambitious characters like you.

1:10:24.150 --> 1:10:25.020
Why?

1:10:25.020 --> 1:10:26.140
Because you're straightforward

1:10:26.140 --> 1:10:28.200
and you sort the situation simply.

1:10:28.690 --> 1:10:31.350
But that's different from product value.

1:10:32.190 --> 1:10:34.060
I said it earlier.

1:10:34.760 --> 1:10:37.360
There are tons of excellent singers like you.

1:10:37.600 --> 1:10:38.600
And

1:10:39.330 --> 1:10:41.530
your character overlaps with Lune.

1:10:41.530 --> 1:10:43.700
CEO Ma must've known that.

1:10:48.940 --> 1:10:51.740
Hey. Why are you here?

1:10:54.950 --> 1:10:56.350
Seriously.

1:10:56.950 --> 1:10:58.680
I'm going mad.

1:11:00.520 --> 1:11:01.520
Sir!

1:11:01.820 --> 1:11:03.150
Why make things get out of hand?

1:11:03.150 --> 1:11:04.960
Just disband them!

1:11:04.960 --> 1:11:06.760
Don't you feel sorry for them?

1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:17.470
They challenged my judgment

1:11:18.340 --> 1:11:20.200
and my authority.

1:11:20.940 --> 1:11:21.940
What?

1:11:25.840 --> 1:11:26.880
He's a wacko.

1:11:27.680 --> 1:11:29.710
He must be a psychopath.

1:11:29.710 --> 1:11:32.220
He might roam around at night with a knife.

1:11:36.550 --> 1:11:38.230
Did Elle leave already?

1:11:43.530 --> 1:11:45.700
At least, the rooster is loyal.

1:11:45.860 --> 1:11:47.370
Should I be moved?

1:11:49.900 --> 1:11:51.340
Don't trust CEO Cha.

1:11:51.700 --> 1:11:52.840
If I don't?

1:11:53.340 --> 1:11:55.410
Should I say I won't take this test?

1:11:55.610 --> 1:11:56.670
Now?

1:11:57.780 --> 1:11:59.680
I don't trust CEO Cha.

1:12:01.010 --> 1:12:02.450
I trust us.

1:12:06.450 --> 1:12:07.500
By the way...

1:12:09.690 --> 1:12:12.390
Why do you hate him so much?

1:12:17.760 --> 1:12:19.660
He did this to me once.

1:12:22.430 --> 1:12:25.170
That all I had to do was show him 1% potential.

1:12:26.870 --> 1:12:28.940
I don't know if this will help.

1:12:29.870 --> 1:12:33.280
But he can't stand to lose in small things.

1:12:35.410 --> 1:12:36.780
That's your chance.

1:12:40.750 --> 1:12:41.850
Jenna!

1:12:42.320 --> 1:12:43.990
Good job!

1:12:44.260 --> 1:12:45.760
Even if it was rambling nonsense,

1:12:45.760 --> 1:12:47.860
I felt like a huge weight was lifted!

1:12:47.860 --> 1:12:48.760
Right!

1:12:48.960 --> 1:12:50.960
It's not rambling nonsense?

1:12:51.460 --> 1:12:52.330
Nope.

1:12:52.330 --> 1:12:54.270
You're really planning to go on a music show

1:12:54.270 --> 1:12:55.800
and become No.1?

1:12:55.930 --> 1:12:56.830
Yep.

1:12:57.340 --> 1:12:58.700
Then we'll really

1:13:01.110 --> 1:13:02.670
disband?

1:13:11.280 --> 1:13:13.720
The world mocked us, saying we were finished.

1:13:16.620 --> 1:13:18.390
I pretended not to hear.

1:13:21.060 --> 1:13:23.360
And I asked for one more chance.

1:13:24.630 --> 1:13:26.930
I said we could do really well.

1:13:28.170 --> 1:13:29.530
I begged.

1:13:30.540 --> 1:13:31.940
I groveled.

1:13:37.210 --> 1:13:38.640
But...

1:13:41.250 --> 1:13:42.370
I didn't know.

1:13:43.080 --> 1:13:45.180
The reason I went to such lengths...

1:13:47.450 --> 1:13:49.890
There must've been a reason.

1:13:51.990 --> 1:13:54.090
But I couldn't think of it no matter what.

1:13:57.760 --> 1:13:58.760
But

1:13:59.830 --> 1:14:03.800
now I know why.

1:14:06.040 --> 1:14:10.110
This... Is it.

1:14:11.840 --> 1:14:13.540
We have to stop here.

1:14:24.920 --> 1:14:27.930
But we can't go out like this.

1:14:29.090 --> 1:14:30.660
We worked so hard!

1:14:32.100 --> 1:14:34.230
We should have at least one memory of success.

1:14:35.200 --> 1:14:36.970
It'd be good to end like that.

1:14:39.700 --> 1:14:41.440
Then I won't regret anything.

1:14:43.340 --> 1:14:45.310
I don't want to regret who I am from now on.

1:14:46.040 --> 1:14:47.680
What I was looking for

1:14:47.910 --> 1:14:49.580
wasn't one chance,

1:14:50.650 --> 1:14:52.320
but one success.

1:15:00.420 --> 1:15:01.990
We're going to stop?

1:15:02.360 --> 1:15:06.040
We're really quitting?

1:15:13.840 --> 1:15:15.640
I'm sorry I made the decision alone.

1:15:16.770 --> 1:15:18.810
If you're against it, tell me now.

1:15:20.910 --> 1:15:22.110
I agree!

1:15:23.450 --> 1:15:24.750
I agree!

1:15:27.850 --> 1:15:31.990
I'm going to break out of this booth!

1:15:33.320 --> 1:15:35.290
I'm going to become an adult in the outside world!

1:15:43.670 --> 1:15:44.970
Darn it...

1:15:46.500 --> 1:15:48.910
This is crappy...

1:15:50.780 --> 1:15:55.250
But okay! I agree, too!

1:15:57.010 --> 1:15:59.080
Rather than end as a failed idol group,

1:16:00.750 --> 1:16:03.150
it's better to end as a No.1 disbanded group.

1:16:04.560 --> 1:16:06.460
I don't want to regret who I am, either.

1:16:10.530 --> 1:16:12.730
Wait, but

1:16:12.730 --> 1:16:14.930
No.1 in a music show is too much.

1:16:16.270 --> 1:16:17.550
Oh Hyun-ji.

1:16:18.700 --> 1:16:20.240
Remember what you said?

1:16:22.310 --> 1:16:23.740
You live only for today.

1:16:23.940 --> 1:16:25.340
You don't have a tomorrow.

1:16:25.680 --> 1:16:27.350
From now on,

1:16:27.750 --> 1:16:29.010
we don't have a tomorrow.

1:16:30.150 --> 1:16:31.380
We only live for today.

1:16:31.920 --> 1:16:33.600
So nothing is impossible.

1:16:35.420 --> 1:16:37.920
We've been scared for too long.

1:16:38.220 --> 1:16:39.760
We've been intimidated

1:16:40.460 --> 1:16:42.130
and diminished for too long.

1:16:44.660 --> 1:16:45.760
We have no tomorrow.

1:16:46.130 --> 1:16:47.530
So there's no need for that now.

1:16:50.870 --> 1:16:51.870
So.

1:16:53.640 --> 1:16:55.110
After we disband?

1:16:55.510 --> 1:16:56.810
What next?

1:17:02.550 --> 1:17:03.780
We go forward.

1:17:14.460 --> 1:17:15.530
Okay, then.

1:17:16.760 --> 1:17:18.800
First, we have to pass Reporter Mo.

1:17:21.070 --> 1:17:22.870
There's no way he'll write about us.

1:17:24.470 --> 1:17:25.770
I have an idea.

1:17:26.740 --> 1:17:28.340
It's evil, but...

1:17:32.140 --> 1:17:33.910
I like that.

1:17:34.580 --> 1:17:35.580
Great!

1:17:37.110 --> 1:17:38.480
Let's get No.1!

1:17:39.950 --> 1:17:40.850
On that stage,

1:17:40.850 --> 1:17:43.960
I'm going to say something to those

1:17:45.190 --> 1:17:46.620
who mocked Du-ho.

1:17:46.620 --> 1:17:47.620
What is it?

1:17:53.360 --> 1:17:54.400
Hey!

1:17:55.130 --> 1:17:57.100
You must be crazy. What are you doing?

1:17:57.100 --> 1:17:58.870
I'm really going to do it.

1:18:02.810 --> 1:18:05.110
You said you couldn't work this week.

1:18:05.110 --> 1:18:06.640
So we got someone else.

1:18:08.710 --> 1:18:10.450
We filled your time slots.

1:18:10.450 --> 1:18:11.950
She's in a difficult situation, too.

1:18:11.950 --> 1:18:13.630
I can't tell her to quit.

1:18:21.590 --> 1:18:23.260
I can't get a break.

1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:30.030
Thanks.

1:18:32.940 --> 1:18:37.310
If you have a place to stay, don't come home.

1:18:40.040 --> 1:18:41.750
Your dad is the same.

1:18:45.450 --> 1:18:47.490
Are you going to keep living like that, Mom?

1:18:47.820 --> 1:18:49.990
He's fine when he doesn't drink.

1:18:50.790 --> 1:18:52.220
At least, he doesn't hit me.

1:18:52.220 --> 1:18:54.190
Breaking stuff is the same!

1:18:55.030 --> 1:18:57.630
Aren't you scared when he's breaking things?

1:18:57.630 --> 1:18:59.840
Is it fun watching him?

1:19:01.140 --> 1:19:04.150
When will you be on TV?

1:19:05.200 --> 1:19:09.010
I wish I can see you often, even if it's just on TV.

1:19:20.450 --> 1:19:22.950
I have to be by your father's side.

1:19:23.820 --> 1:19:25.360
When you become famous,

1:19:25.360 --> 1:19:27.090
he won't keep silent.

1:19:27.560 --> 1:19:28.990
You know those people

1:19:29.460 --> 1:19:31.260
who parade their famous celebrity kids

1:19:31.260 --> 1:19:32.900
and screw people over and scam them.

1:19:33.900 --> 1:19:35.730
He'll do that and more.

1:19:36.100 --> 1:19:38.270
I have to be by his side to stop him.

1:19:58.960 --> 1:20:00.640
What's Kim Jenna doing?

1:20:01.060 --> 1:20:02.530
What do you think?

1:20:02.530 --> 1:20:04.060
She's probably devastated.

1:20:06.600 --> 1:20:07.600
Sir.

1:20:08.600 --> 1:20:10.670
Settle the compensation now

1:20:10.670 --> 1:20:12.300
and send them out with encouragement.

1:20:12.300 --> 1:20:15.240
Are you doing this to save puny money?

1:20:15.710 --> 1:20:18.410
Do you think that's why I'm doing that?

1:20:18.910 --> 1:20:22.450
With that mindset, I won't succeed anywhere.

1:20:23.680 --> 1:20:26.320
Then are you giving them a vaccination shot

1:20:26.320 --> 1:20:28.090
so they'll do well in the future?

1:20:28.090 --> 1:20:29.290
That's a good expression.

1:20:30.790 --> 1:20:31.690
Sir.

1:20:31.690 --> 1:20:33.130
Is your pride hurt

1:20:33.320 --> 1:20:35.790
because Jenna stood up against you?

1:20:43.570 --> 1:20:45.200
I'm American.

1:20:46.200 --> 1:20:47.800
What does that mean?

1:20:50.510 --> 1:20:51.610
Well...

1:20:52.040 --> 1:20:54.810
I'm asking if you're in a battle of pride with Jenna.

1:20:54.810 --> 1:20:57.580
She probably has no intention of doing that.

1:20:57.580 --> 1:20:59.320
What do you take me for? Seriously!

1:20:59.520 --> 1:21:01.420
I just caught that vibe.

1:21:07.360 --> 1:21:08.360
Come in.

1:21:10.160 --> 1:21:11.330
Director.

1:21:11.330 --> 1:21:13.600
You look terrible these days.

1:21:13.700 --> 1:21:14.660
Do I?

1:21:16.300 --> 1:21:18.270
Is anyone hiring a director?

1:21:18.270 --> 1:21:20.400
A peaceful and stressless place?

1:21:20.540 --> 1:21:22.010
Go look for one.

1:21:22.140 --> 1:21:23.870
I know you prefer not to see me.

1:21:30.610 --> 1:21:32.180
I guess you're not busy.

1:21:32.180 --> 1:21:33.850
Seeing a superstar like you coming here so often.

1:21:33.850 --> 1:21:36.450
I said I won't feature in Lune's song a long time ago.

1:21:37.290 --> 1:21:38.660
Why bring it up again?

1:21:38.990 --> 1:21:39.820
Why won't you?

1:21:39.820 --> 1:21:41.190
There's no reason not to.

1:21:42.330 --> 1:21:44.430
But there's a reason you have to.

1:21:44.430 --> 1:21:45.800
I don't like her.

1:21:46.200 --> 1:21:48.130
I don't sing for people I don't like.

1:21:48.130 --> 1:21:49.810
That's not professional.

1:21:50.630 --> 1:21:51.900
I don't care what you think.

1:21:51.900 --> 1:21:53.340
This is why

1:21:53.970 --> 1:21:56.610
I was going to get rid of your respirator long ago.

1:21:57.780 --> 1:21:59.340
You showed no promise of being a pro.

1:21:59.340 --> 1:22:01.180
I've come back alive. What will you do?

1:22:02.350 --> 1:22:04.580
But you've come into my hands. What will you do?

1:22:04.950 --> 1:22:06.250
Unbelievable.

1:22:10.950 --> 1:22:15.730
Oh! You know I'm not the old me, right?

1:22:22.570 --> 1:22:23.670
Where are you?

1:22:23.670 --> 1:22:24.670
I have something to say.

1:22:24.900 --> 1:22:25.900
Me, too.

1:22:30.170 --> 1:22:32.110
I know this will sound crazy.

1:22:33.040 --> 1:22:34.010
But I want to ask you a favor.

1:22:34.010 --> 1:22:35.350
I want to ask you a favor first.

1:22:36.580 --> 1:22:37.880
Let's start

1:22:40.780 --> 1:22:41.950
a rumor we're dating.

1:22:51.780 --> 1:22:55.080
Special thanks to Jung Woong-in and Kang Jae-jun
for their cameo appearance

1:23:13.850 --> 1:23:15.950
IDOL
IDOL: The Coup

1:23:15.950 --> 1:23:18.090
A battle of a man's pride is that juvenile.

1:23:18.090 --> 1:23:20.320
Why are you so reckless?

1:23:20.320 --> 1:23:23.190
I want to see if we really have no potential.

1:23:23.190 --> 1:23:24.030
Bye.

1:23:24.030 --> 1:23:25.300
If that's what you believe, then go.

1:23:25.300 --> 1:23:26.230
I'm a bit angry.

1:23:26.230 --> 1:23:27.700
I let you exploit me to this extent.

1:23:27.700 --> 1:23:29.030
Are you picking a fight with me?

1:23:29.030 --> 1:23:30.900
The type of person who will

1:23:30.900 --> 1:23:32.140
bite when cornered.

1:23:32.140 --> 1:23:33.770
What we really want?

1:23:32.140 --> 1:23:32.770
Exclusive Contract Cancellation Agreement

1:23:33.770 --> 1:23:34.570
You think it was money?

1:23:34.570 --> 1:23:36.340
This isn't such a simple matter!

1:23:36.340 --> 1:23:39.410
You can make it into a simple matter!

1:23:39.610 --> 1:23:40.410
Just wait and see.

1:23:40.410 --> 1:23:41.950
See how we pull this off.
