00:18.360 --> 00:20.360
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:23.080 --> 00:26.720
Hello and welcome to Top Gear.
Now...

00:26.720 --> 00:31.360
..I think you'd be pretty impressed
if I told you we drove a car

00:31.360 --> 00:35.000
to the bottom of the sea and then
drove it out again, right?

00:35.000 --> 00:37.480
Right? Well, this week...

00:37.480 --> 00:39.040
..we do half of that.

00:39.040 --> 00:41.600
But first, we need to talk about
the British economy.

00:41.600 --> 00:44.040
Now, the Government has a plan
to speed up business,

00:44.040 --> 00:47.800
and it's something called HS2,
a high-speed train line between

00:47.800 --> 00:52.000
London and the North, and they say
it's going to cost £56 billion.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.400
But Chris Harris thinks he's got
a better business plan.

00:58.760 --> 00:59.960
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:59.960 --> 01:05.800
the future of British business
could just be the BMW M5.

01:05.800 --> 01:09.040
At £90,000, it sounds expensive,

01:09.040 --> 01:11.120
but for the price of HS2,

01:11.120 --> 01:15.160
you could buy one of these
with petrol money to spare

01:15.160 --> 01:18.400
for the entire population
of Manchester.

01:20.920 --> 01:24.480
That'll speed up business
between London and the North.

01:25.920 --> 01:30.400
Because this is an M5
with a 4.4 litre twin turbo V8

01:30.400 --> 01:33.480
with just about 600hp.

01:33.480 --> 01:36.320
And that means it's really
very fast...

01:36.320 --> 01:37.680
..indeed.

01:39.440 --> 01:40.760
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

01:42.280 --> 01:48.440
In fact, this four-door saloon car
has a top speed of 190mph.

01:50.120 --> 01:51.560
The world's gone mad!

01:54.200 --> 01:57.120
The Government reckons
its shiny new train will do

01:57.120 --> 02:00.560
Manchester to London in one hour
and eight minutes.

02:00.560 --> 02:03.920
Now, in the new M5, at 190mph,

02:03.920 --> 02:07.680
you'd cover the same distance
in one hour and FIVE minutes.

02:09.520 --> 02:12.880
OK, you have to break a few
speed limits along the way.

02:12.880 --> 02:14.760
But we're thinking big ideas here.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.400
Besides, it's not just
top speed where the M5 leaves

02:19.400 --> 02:20.960
the train in the sidings.

02:22.360 --> 02:27.480
Because BMW says
it'll do 62mph in 3.4 seconds.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.200
That's impressive!

02:32.200 --> 02:36.840
Which is about 25 seconds faster
than any train on the planet.

02:39.240 --> 02:41.840
And the reason it's so fast
off the line?

02:41.840 --> 02:43.920
Well, it's four-wheel drive.

02:43.920 --> 02:45.960
Yeah, BMW has done the unthinkable.

02:45.960 --> 02:49.680
The M5 is defined by being
the ultimate two-wheel drive

02:49.680 --> 02:52.360
fast saloon car,
but when you have 600hp,

02:52.360 --> 02:54.640
you need to drive all four wheels.

02:55.760 --> 03:00.840
Now, for die-hard M5 fanatics out
there like me, this is a big one.

03:02.120 --> 03:05.120
Because selling the M5's
rear-drive soul for the sake

03:05.120 --> 03:09.320
of some extra traction is frankly
nothing short of sacrilege.

03:10.320 --> 03:13.760
So, it's just as well BMW
has a solution.

03:13.760 --> 03:17.360
Because if I fiddle around down here
and play with my menus,

03:17.360 --> 03:21.120
the sensible four-wheel drive
super saloon becomes a...

03:23.920 --> 03:25.640
HE LAUGHS

03:28.080 --> 03:31.480
..a very un-sensible,
two-wheel drive saloon car.

03:33.160 --> 03:34.880
And that's an M5.

03:36.880 --> 03:41.600
This button is basically the 11pm
at the Christmas party button -

03:41.600 --> 03:44.960
business matters out the window,
tequila shots all round,

03:44.960 --> 03:47.560
probably going to end a bit messily.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.240
That is some trick. Four-wheel drive
when you want to be sensible.

03:52.240 --> 03:54.840
Two-wheel drive
when you want to be an idiot.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.240
- Oh, - BLEEP, - that's lairy.

04:01.320 --> 04:04.760
And let's not forget,
the M5 will do all of this

04:04.760 --> 04:08.640
and let you avoid
the misery of rail travel.

04:08.640 --> 04:10.800
I'm never going to make
that meeting,

04:10.800 --> 04:14.720
you need to move the meeting,
just move it to the later one.

04:14.720 --> 04:16.399
I told you to do it yesterday.

04:16.399 --> 04:18.680
I don't know why we're still
having this conversation.

04:18.680 --> 04:20.399
No, I can't, really...

04:24.840 --> 04:27.200
I really think we've got
this one nailed.

04:27.200 --> 04:30.040
Just ditch HS2
and your fancy train project

04:30.040 --> 04:33.680
and make sure that it's M5s
all round, please.

04:33.680 --> 04:35.360
Thank you, Government.

04:35.360 --> 04:37.520
Like all big government projects,

04:37.520 --> 04:40.320
though, this will have to be
put out to tender.

04:41.440 --> 04:43.240
And there is another bidder.

04:46.760 --> 04:50.480
The Mercedes AMG E63 S.

04:51.640 --> 04:56.800
Just like the M5, it's a four-door
saloon that costs about £90,000.

04:56.800 --> 04:58.480
And, just like the M5,

04:58.480 --> 05:03.720
it's got a twin turbo V8
sending 600hp from four-wheel drive.

05:05.800 --> 05:08.600
0-60, 3.4 seconds.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.760
Top speed, 186mph.

05:12.800 --> 05:15.840
Which is a bit less than the BMW,
but still, you know...enough.

05:17.920 --> 05:19.800
And just like the M5...

05:20.880 --> 05:27.040
..push a few buttons and the E63 S
will also become rear-wheel drive.

05:33.560 --> 05:37.640
It takes all of about ten seconds
driving it to realise

05:37.640 --> 05:41.160
the Mercedes is actually a much more
aggressive machine.

05:41.160 --> 05:45.080
The gear changes are faster,
it revs faster.

05:47.320 --> 05:49.760
The whole car wants to be
even more of a hooligan.

05:52.240 --> 05:55.480
Good Lord! And it sounds so angry!

05:57.800 --> 06:01.680
It sounds oddly familiar.

06:01.680 --> 06:03.760
When I was younger,
I had a physics teacher

06:03.760 --> 06:05.080
who dressed really normally.

06:05.080 --> 06:07.760
From the outside, he looked
like the most ordinary man alive,

06:07.760 --> 06:10.000
placid, easy-going.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.040
But when he blew his fuse,
he went absolutely nuts.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.600
That's the E63.

06:14.600 --> 06:18.160
From the outside, it looks ordinary,
but when you get in it

06:18.160 --> 06:22.120
and let it go, it's a frothing
lunatic of a super saloon!

06:27.360 --> 06:32.440
The M5 invented this class of car,
that's why it's called the M5 class.

06:32.440 --> 06:33.960
And Mercedes, bless it,

06:33.960 --> 06:37.320
has spent decades trying
to muscle in on BMW's patch.

06:38.520 --> 06:41.560
With this car,
it might finally have done it.

06:43.600 --> 06:46.760
But there is, of course,
only one way to find out.

06:48.680 --> 06:51.520
Because if we're going to speed up
Britain's economy,

06:51.520 --> 06:56.840
what really matters is which car is
the fastest way to do business.

06:58.720 --> 07:00.680
Now, I can't drive both cars,

07:00.680 --> 07:03.840
so we've had to call in some help
from the only creature ever to

07:03.840 --> 07:07.680
have been rejected as an Apprentice
candidate for being too obnoxious.

07:07.680 --> 07:09.960
It's The Stig's business cousin.

07:11.960 --> 07:13.480
And he is mighty business.

07:15.320 --> 07:17.240
Got your Filofax in there?

07:17.240 --> 07:21.440
THE APPRENTICE THEME PLAYS

07:29.160 --> 07:31.320
So, one lap of the track,

07:31.320 --> 07:35.200
the winner first to reach
the boss's parking space.

07:35.200 --> 07:38.480
Business time starts
on the stroke of the hour.

07:57.880 --> 07:59.320
That is just cheating.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.760
Absolutely ruthless, this.

08:04.760 --> 08:06.640
Business Stig not to be messed with.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.360
You know all those awful
motivational phrases?

08:10.360 --> 08:12.720
He invented all of them,
Business Stig did.

08:14.120 --> 08:17.400
"Blue sky thinking"?
Before that, we just had ideas.

08:20.520 --> 08:21.560
It was a shambles.

08:24.760 --> 08:27.560
"Get your ducks in a row," that was
Stig, he invented that one.

08:29.320 --> 08:31.760
Before that, there were just
ducks everywhere.

08:36.640 --> 08:39.440
Oh, I'm looking a bit quicker
than you, Mr Stig.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.880
Right, I've got him up the inside.

08:53.120 --> 08:54.840
I've got him! I've got him!

09:01.960 --> 09:03.920
To the winner the spoils.

09:07.040 --> 09:08.600
Where are you going?

09:08.600 --> 09:10.920
Power lunch, is it? Power lunch?

09:10.920 --> 09:12.400
Sulky.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.080
I'll shut your door, shall I?

09:14.080 --> 09:15.160
DOOR SHUTS

09:20.480 --> 09:22.400
There you go, Government,

09:22.400 --> 09:27.800
the future of British business
lies in the E63 S.

09:27.800 --> 09:31.880
I can't tell you how closely matched
these two cars are.

09:31.880 --> 09:35.440
The M5 is a fantastic super saloon.

09:35.440 --> 09:38.800
But, for me, the Mercedes just
edges it in a couple of key areas.

09:38.800 --> 09:41.400
It's more exciting without
the compromise of being

09:41.400 --> 09:42.600
any less comfortable.

09:42.600 --> 09:45.280
It's a bit more agile.

09:45.280 --> 09:47.760
And I just love that engine
and that gearbox.

09:47.760 --> 09:51.400
So, yes, the M5
has finally been beaten.

09:51.400 --> 09:54.080
I think this is the best
fast saloon car you can buy.

09:55.720 --> 09:58.880
This is a bold statement.

09:58.880 --> 10:03.840
But also, I'm afraid, in this day
and age, a completely pointless one.

10:03.840 --> 10:07.160
Out in the real world,
there's no escaping the fact that

10:07.160 --> 10:09.960
600hp super saloons,
they just don't make sense.

10:11.560 --> 10:15.400
Back in the '80s, when the first M5
was launched, that was different.

10:15.400 --> 10:18.840
That M5 would have got you from home
to the office, to the golf club,

10:18.840 --> 10:22.840
or wherever else you wanted to go
faster than a normal 5 Series.

10:22.840 --> 10:24.520
But not any more.

10:26.640 --> 10:29.320
A diesel 5 Series will get you
there just as quick,

10:29.320 --> 10:31.920
cost you half as much to buy
and half as much to fuel.

10:34.560 --> 10:37.680
This car - these cars -
they're irrelevant.

10:37.680 --> 10:41.160
They're an answer to a question
people are no longer asking.

10:42.520 --> 10:46.440
As irrelevant answers go, though,
it is an entertaining one.

10:47.800 --> 10:51.160
And, let's face it,
it still beats the train.

10:55.240 --> 10:57.840
APPLAUSE

11:02.160 --> 11:03.600
So, to summarise,

11:03.600 --> 11:06.840
what you're saying is the Government
should just get rid of this

11:06.840 --> 11:10.680
HS2 thing and just give everyone in
Manchester a Mercedes E63 instead?

11:10.680 --> 11:14.560
Yeah, common-sense policies
for a common-sense Britain.

11:14.560 --> 11:19.240
You have had some ludicrous
theories in your time. But this...

11:19.240 --> 11:22.440
- ..this is genius! - Thank you.
- I can't see a flaw!

11:22.440 --> 11:25.120
And I love the fact that
they're all-wheel drive

11:25.120 --> 11:27.880
and rear-wheel drive.
You know what these cars are?

11:27.880 --> 11:29.400
They're mullets.

11:29.400 --> 11:31.920
Party at the front,
business at the rear.

11:33.120 --> 11:35.560
- Was it the other way around?
- It was, wasn't it?

11:35.560 --> 11:37.640
LAUGHTER

11:39.800 --> 11:41.360
I've never had a mullet!

11:41.360 --> 11:45.440
And also, it feels a bit wrong,
us making hair gags, doesn't it?

11:45.440 --> 11:46.720
You know?

11:46.720 --> 11:49.240
- Well, one of us has a choice
about their hairstyle. - Yeah.

11:49.240 --> 11:52.920
But they are fantastic things.
Awesome super saloons.

11:52.920 --> 11:55.400
Let's big it up
for the super saloons.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.360
Now, the other day in the office,
we were having a debate.

12:03.360 --> 12:06.480
What's the most versatile car
in the world?

12:06.480 --> 12:10.240
Range Rover? Jeep?
The good old American pick-up truck?

12:10.240 --> 12:12.960
Well, not according to Chris Harris,
because he thinks

12:12.960 --> 12:16.280
there's one vehicle out there that
beats them all for versatility,

12:16.280 --> 12:17.960
and he took me on a little trip

12:17.960 --> 12:20.440
to its natural habitat
just around the corner.

12:23.760 --> 12:25.160
Sri Lanka.

12:26.560 --> 12:31.800
25,000 square miles of every terrain
imaginable.

12:31.800 --> 12:36.200
From beaches to rainforest,
mountains to city sprawl.

12:39.520 --> 12:43.200
It's where a population of more
than 20 million has chosen

12:43.200 --> 12:47.840
one vehicle above all others
to tame this tropical island.

12:47.840 --> 12:49.720
And I think they're on to something.

12:54.600 --> 12:57.600
Welcome to Sri Lanka.
The beautiful city of Kandy.

12:57.600 --> 12:59.960
- I know one thing about Sri Lanka.
- What's that? - Elephants.

12:59.960 --> 13:02.240
- Can we see some elephants?
- All in good time, Matthew.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.680
I've brought you to Sri Lanka
to experience one of the most

13:04.680 --> 13:07.960
versatile forms of transport
on the planet, OK?

13:07.960 --> 13:10.280
And what's more,
I've brought us one each.

13:10.280 --> 13:12.600
- You've brought us elephants?
- No, I've brought us cars.

13:12.600 --> 13:15.560
- It's a car show.
- OK, all right. - Here we go.

13:21.480 --> 13:24.080
- What do you think? - You brought me
halfway round the world

13:24.080 --> 13:25.240
to see a tuk-tuk?

13:25.240 --> 13:28.040
I knew you'd take some convincing,
so we're going to go

13:28.040 --> 13:30.680
on a little drive to demonstrate
just how versatile

13:30.680 --> 13:31.920
the humble tuk-tuk is.

13:31.920 --> 13:34.360
You have the red one,
I'll have the green one.

13:34.360 --> 13:35.720
You're going to love this!

13:35.720 --> 13:37.360
MATT SIGHS

13:39.360 --> 13:43.480
Ah! A handlebar in a car.
Very clever.

13:43.480 --> 13:46.600
So, they get the worst parts
of a motorcycle and the worst parts

13:46.600 --> 13:50.360
of a car and welded them together
and there you have the tuk-tuk.

13:50.360 --> 13:51.800
All right.

13:51.800 --> 13:53.120
This...

13:54.280 --> 13:55.640
..this should be awful.

13:57.200 --> 13:59.800
I was going to take Matt
on a tuk-tuk adventure,

13:59.800 --> 14:01.880
starting here in Kandy.

14:01.880 --> 14:05.760
Along the way, we'd undertake
a series of rigorous tests,

14:05.760 --> 14:09.840
culminating in an ascent
of the fearsome Devil's Staircase.

14:10.920 --> 14:14.280
But first, I was going to prove
this is the ultimate car

14:14.280 --> 14:16.200
to handle the chaos of the city.

14:16.200 --> 14:18.880
CAR HORNS BEEP

14:20.760 --> 14:22.520
Ha-ha! This is madness!

14:22.520 --> 14:23.720
CAR HORN BEEPS

14:23.720 --> 14:25.080
Great madness, though.

14:27.000 --> 14:31.640
The tuk-tuk, then, named after
its distinctive "tuk-tuk" noise.

14:31.640 --> 14:33.440
Isn't it brilliant?

14:33.440 --> 14:35.000
BUS HORN BEEPS

14:35.000 --> 14:36.040
Ooh!

14:36.040 --> 14:39.280
Now, this is, of course,
rear engine and rear-wheel drive,

14:39.280 --> 14:41.080
just like a Porsche 911.

14:41.080 --> 14:46.240
Unlike a 911, even with tailwind,
this'll do about 40mph.

14:46.240 --> 14:50.680
But forget performance, because this
is about brilliant simplicity.

14:50.680 --> 14:54.840
Two cylinders, about 11hp
from its four-stroke engine,

14:54.840 --> 14:57.760
weighs about 300kg.

14:57.760 --> 15:00.840
So, it's economical and easy to fix,

15:00.840 --> 15:03.240
which is quite crucial around here.

15:03.240 --> 15:05.080
It's just beautifully simple.

15:05.080 --> 15:09.360
This is the automobile
stripped back to its underpants.

15:10.920 --> 15:12.240
Ooh!

15:12.240 --> 15:13.360
OK.

15:13.360 --> 15:16.040
My first impressions of the tuk-tuk.

15:16.040 --> 15:19.160
Well, you'll be surprised to hear
that it's actually...

15:19.160 --> 15:20.680
..really slow.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.040
And noisy.

15:22.040 --> 15:24.560
TYRES SCREECH
It... Whoa! It handles...

15:24.560 --> 15:26.240
Almost tipped over, there.

15:26.240 --> 15:30.040
It's amazing that something this
slow can feel this dangerous.

15:33.360 --> 15:35.880
Are you kidding me
with these things?!

15:35.880 --> 15:39.120
Honestly, can you think of anything
you'd rather be driving, here, now?

15:39.120 --> 15:40.600
Literally anything else!

15:40.600 --> 15:42.600
- Oh, come on! - Anything!

15:42.600 --> 15:43.680
HORN BEEPS

15:43.680 --> 15:45.160
Why is this guy beeping at me?

15:45.160 --> 15:47.920
HORNS BEEPING

15:47.920 --> 15:50.360
- Ah, shut up.
- I've got a solution, OK?

15:50.360 --> 15:53.320
I know someone that can make
these things safer.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.720
Safer? It's a deathtrap!

15:55.720 --> 15:57.200
Not for long, it wasn't.

15:59.280 --> 16:01.880
THEY CHANT

16:10.360 --> 16:13.200
Oh, they've blessing.

16:13.200 --> 16:14.880
Hindu tradition.

16:14.880 --> 16:17.520
Round here, when you buy something
that's significant to you,

16:17.520 --> 16:19.520
like a house or a car,

16:19.520 --> 16:23.200
this is what you do to guarantee
its safe and prosperous future.

16:24.480 --> 16:26.000
I like it.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.840
I think it's cool.

16:27.840 --> 16:31.360
Plus, we need all the help we can
get out there in these things.

16:31.360 --> 16:34.560
This negativity is not going to aid
the blessing process.

16:34.560 --> 16:35.920
I'm not being negative!

16:35.920 --> 16:39.000
I told you, I like it,
I think it's cool. Yeah!

16:40.160 --> 16:43.120
In a head-on collision,
how does the lime juice help?

16:43.120 --> 16:45.320
CHANTING CONTINUES

16:45.320 --> 16:50.160
With our tuk-tuks now apparently
safer than an armour-plated Volvo,

16:50.160 --> 16:51.560
next, it was our turn.

16:51.560 --> 16:53.480
Didn't know that was coming.

16:53.480 --> 16:56.960
- Get him good, he needs
a lot of help. Yeah. - Thank you.

16:56.960 --> 16:59.720
And with the ceremony complete,

16:59.720 --> 17:02.000
it was time for
Chris's next bold claim.

17:04.079 --> 17:06.319
It's also a sports car.

17:06.319 --> 17:08.440
- No, it isn't. - It is. - No, it isn't!

17:08.440 --> 17:09.839
It is, and I'm going to show you.

17:12.680 --> 17:16.280
Because just down the road,
at a local stadium,

17:16.280 --> 17:18.839
I'd arranged the perfect
demonstration.

17:21.160 --> 17:23.880
Allow me to introduce you
to the sport of

17:23.880 --> 17:25.400
tuk-tuk polo.

17:27.720 --> 17:30.200
DRAMATIC MUSIC

17:30.200 --> 17:33.880
This is Sri Lanka's answer
to Rome's Colosseum.

17:35.520 --> 17:39.160
This is the ancient -
all right, not that ancient -

17:39.160 --> 17:43.160
gladiatorial sport of tuk-tuk polo.

17:44.760 --> 17:47.160
Two teams doing battle

17:47.160 --> 17:49.960
for the right to be crowned
champion.

17:49.960 --> 17:53.880
Each chariot bravely
manned by one fearless driver

17:53.880 --> 17:56.680
and one bloodthirsty hitter.

17:59.320 --> 18:01.160
CROWD CHEERING

18:01.160 --> 18:04.560
OK, so we need to decide who drives
and who does the hitting.

18:04.560 --> 18:06.480
OK, I'll drive. You're closer
to the ground,

18:06.480 --> 18:08.080
you're better suited for whacking.

18:08.080 --> 18:09.760
No, I'm a racing driver, I drive.

18:09.760 --> 18:11.720
And you told me
you played ice hockey.

18:11.720 --> 18:14.440
- You know what, I know how we can
solve this. - Go on, then.

18:18.600 --> 18:22.520
- Oh, that's democratic, isn't it?
- Yeah, it is. I'm driving.

18:22.520 --> 18:25.680
With three tuk-tuks to a team,
played over two chukkas -

18:25.680 --> 18:27.520
that's halves to you and me -

18:27.520 --> 18:30.120
we were almost ready to go to war.

18:30.120 --> 18:31.760
OK, what's our strategy?

18:31.760 --> 18:33.440
Huh? We need to own
the inside of the field,

18:33.440 --> 18:35.560
lock it down before
the first chukka, OK?

18:35.560 --> 18:37.920
What on Earth are you talking about?
How do you know so much about polo?

18:37.920 --> 18:40.280
Look, I know a little bit about
a lot of things.

18:40.280 --> 18:43.200
- I was just planning on whacking it
as hard as I can. - Good plan.

18:43.200 --> 18:45.240
Ready?
ENGINE STARTS

18:45.240 --> 18:46.720
As I'll ever be.

18:49.160 --> 18:53.360
In charge of the action,
known locally as the Emperor,

18:53.360 --> 18:56.880
was referee and, strangely enough,
coach of today's opposition,

18:56.880 --> 18:58.840
Geoffrey Dodds.

18:58.840 --> 19:02.280
OK, I want this to be a fair
and proper chukka.

19:02.280 --> 19:05.920
So, with the crowd at fever pitch,
it was time.

19:05.920 --> 19:08.000
HE BLOWS WHISTLE

19:08.000 --> 19:09.080
Go!

19:09.080 --> 19:11.120
We got it, we got it, got it,
got it!

19:11.120 --> 19:13.320
Left-hand side, left-hand side!

19:13.320 --> 19:15.440
MEN GRUNTING

19:17.040 --> 19:18.840
With the game up and running...

19:18.840 --> 19:19.880
Turn it, turn it!

19:19.880 --> 19:23.760
..we quickly realised
we did have a few issues.

19:23.760 --> 19:25.320
This is just going
to end up in a massive...

19:25.320 --> 19:26.920
- CRASHING
- ..pile-up!

19:26.920 --> 19:28.840
I've broken my mallet!

19:28.840 --> 19:31.480
What with Chris's relentless
directions...

19:31.480 --> 19:34.680
Keep going, keep going, going,
going, going! Go, go, go!

19:34.680 --> 19:35.800
Stop, stop, go!

19:35.800 --> 19:38.040
..the much more experienced
opposition...

19:39.600 --> 19:42.080
- No! - No! - No!

19:42.080 --> 19:43.520
THEY GROAN

19:43.520 --> 19:44.840
Oh!

19:44.840 --> 19:46.760
Oh, this is terrible!

19:46.760 --> 19:49.560
..the fact that it's really hard
to hit the damn ball...

19:51.080 --> 19:54.080
You just run over the ball, man.
Ow!

19:54.080 --> 19:57.800
..and that when you do,
the ref is so biased...

19:57.800 --> 19:59.440
Ridiculous driving.

19:59.440 --> 20:01.720
That's a bogus call
if I ever heard one!

20:01.720 --> 20:04.640
..he'll do whatever it takes
to make sure you lose...

20:04.640 --> 20:06.160
Hey, no, no, no! Hey!

20:06.160 --> 20:07.720
You're there! Hey!

20:07.720 --> 20:09.880
Two-for-one at Specsavers, ref!

20:09.880 --> 20:12.960
..yeah, it's fair to say
we were getting...hammered.

20:14.400 --> 20:16.880
But as the game
went into injury time...

20:18.560 --> 20:21.280
..we saw our chance and "tuk" it.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.960
- That's what I'm talking about!
- That's settled that!

20:24.960 --> 20:26.840
Woohoo!

20:26.840 --> 20:28.800
CROWD CHEERING

20:28.800 --> 20:31.320
- Well, I'm glad we got one.
- We did get one.

20:31.320 --> 20:33.880
Well, I think
that was a very good first game.

20:33.880 --> 20:35.880
What did you think of Chris's work
with the mallet?

20:35.880 --> 20:37.440
I-I think it was good.

20:37.440 --> 20:39.440
What did you think of
Matt's driving?

20:39.440 --> 20:41.400
Um... It could be better.

20:42.560 --> 20:45.960
You're only saying that because
I called you out on your unfairness.

20:45.960 --> 20:48.720
Come on. Put you in position to
score I don't know how many times.

20:48.720 --> 20:50.200
That's all I'm saying.

20:50.200 --> 20:53.960
That's all I'm going to say.
I don't know how many times.

20:53.960 --> 20:55.440
Six times, I do know how many.

20:55.440 --> 20:57.720
ALL LAUGHING

20:59.360 --> 21:03.040
It's not the winning, though,
it's the tuk-tuk that counts.

21:03.040 --> 21:06.280
And with its sporting credentials
proven, the next morning,

21:06.280 --> 21:10.120
it was time to leave the city behind
and go rural.

21:18.120 --> 21:21.080
Maybe, just maybe,

21:21.080 --> 21:23.160
we'll see some elephants!

21:25.600 --> 21:27.400
Did you know

21:27.400 --> 21:30.960
that Sri Lanka produces nearly 90%

21:30.960 --> 21:32.760
of the world's cinnamon?!

21:32.760 --> 21:34.000
I love cinnamon!

21:34.000 --> 21:36.760
Bit of cinnamon in shepherd's pie

21:36.760 --> 21:39.360
absolutely transforms it.

21:39.360 --> 21:41.480
Remember that.

21:41.480 --> 21:43.600
But we weren't here for cinnamon...

21:43.600 --> 21:45.800
Here, elephant!
- ..or elephants.

21:47.720 --> 21:49.880
We were here for tea.

21:49.880 --> 21:51.280
Lots of tea.

21:53.360 --> 21:56.760
We were heading into Sri Lanka's
famous plantations,

21:56.760 --> 21:58.360
and my next challenge.

22:01.040 --> 22:03.760
OK, time to show you the tuk-tuk's
next party trick.

22:03.760 --> 22:05.200
- Haulage. - What?

22:05.200 --> 22:07.800
The tuk-tuk is the ultimate
vehicle for moving

22:07.800 --> 22:10.200
- stuff from A to B.
- MATT GROANS

22:10.200 --> 22:12.280
To demonstrate,
we're going to have a race.

22:12.280 --> 22:14.400
That, there, is a pick-up truck,
and those gentlemen are going

22:14.400 --> 22:16.600
- to load 25 bags of tea into
that pick-up. - Uh-huh.

22:16.600 --> 22:20.640
And we're going to load 25 bags
of tea into the tuk-tuk here.

22:20.640 --> 22:23.960
Then it's a race to the bottom
of the hill, to the tea factory.

22:23.960 --> 22:25.280
First one there is the winner.

22:25.280 --> 22:28.000
- OK, so we're going to fit
all that tea... - Yeah.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.040
- ..in here? - Yeah, simple.

22:30.040 --> 22:32.520
It's like a TARDIS, you know
we can do that. No problems at all.

22:32.520 --> 22:34.840
OK, fine, I'm driving.

22:34.840 --> 22:36.160
You know, for a tuk-tuk sceptic,

22:36.160 --> 22:38.960
you're surprisingly keen
to keep driving it.

22:38.960 --> 22:41.400
- I think you might be rather
liking it now. - Are we doing this?

22:41.400 --> 22:42.520
Absolutely.

22:42.520 --> 22:45.360
Three, two, one, go!

22:47.960 --> 22:51.320
Roof first, surely the roof first?

22:51.320 --> 22:52.920
Never going to fit.

22:52.920 --> 22:56.080
- They're never going to all fit.
- Yes, they will!

22:56.080 --> 22:57.240
Oh!

23:01.520 --> 23:04.480
- Oh, God, they're done,
they're done! - Push it!

23:04.480 --> 23:07.960
I want it known now, on the record,
that if we lose this,

23:07.960 --> 23:11.040
it was your loading skills
that cost us, not the tuk-tuk, OK?

23:11.040 --> 23:14.000
But while Chris was busy moaning...

23:14.000 --> 23:16.040
ENGINE REVS

23:16.040 --> 23:18.200
..the pick-up was building a lead.

23:18.200 --> 23:20.560
- It's got to go diagonally over...
- It IS going diagonally over!

23:20.560 --> 23:22.000
A little lower, a little lower.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.040
What do you mean,
"a little lower"? No!

23:27.720 --> 23:31.520
And with a lot of ground to make up,
finally, we got going.

23:31.520 --> 23:33.840
ENGINE ZOOMING

23:36.440 --> 23:39.200
- I think we're losing some tea.
- Oh! - There goes one.

23:43.080 --> 23:46.240
It's amazing, it feels unstable but
it doesn't want to go over, does it?

23:46.240 --> 23:49.080
I don't know, it feels like it wants
to go over, yeah.

23:49.080 --> 23:50.560
- Where? - Everywhere.

23:53.840 --> 23:55.680
Whoa!

23:55.680 --> 23:57.760
- Did you hear what that guy said?!
- What did he say?!

23:57.760 --> 23:59.320
He said, "Oooh!"

24:04.120 --> 24:07.120
We're just not going fast enough,
we need a short cut.

24:07.120 --> 24:10.040
And that's the beauty
of the tuk-tuk.

24:10.040 --> 24:13.120
Even fully loaded,
it will go places a pick-up can't.

24:14.120 --> 24:17.200
I'll keep my eyes peeled.
I'm not seeing many at the moment.

24:17.200 --> 24:19.440
- Oh, this is the way.
- Why do you know that?!

24:19.440 --> 24:22.640
- I told you, I know a little bit
about a lot of things. - Whoa, whoa.

24:22.640 --> 24:25.320
- It's good. Get the power on,
get the power on! - I got the power.

24:25.320 --> 24:27.600
Power's good, power's your friend!

24:27.600 --> 24:31.000
- Right here. - Definitely right.
- Has to be a right here. Let's go.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.440
So while the pick-up had to
stick to the winding roads,

24:33.440 --> 24:36.800
we took the direct route
down the hill.

24:36.800 --> 24:38.480
Now we are motoring!

24:40.240 --> 24:43.480
This is making time,
this is definitely saving us time!

24:43.480 --> 24:45.080
- This way. - Yeah, yeah.

24:45.080 --> 24:47.200
And now let's get the wriggle on.

24:47.200 --> 24:50.240
I told you, the tuk-tuk is
the ultimate vehicle for carrying

24:50.240 --> 24:51.960
stuff from A to B!

24:51.960 --> 24:53.520
And thanks to my short cut...

24:53.520 --> 24:55.840
Pick up! Ooh!

24:55.840 --> 24:57.440
..we were still in this race.

24:57.440 --> 24:58.560
- There he is! - There he is!

24:58.560 --> 25:00.760
Get out and get him, we can beat him
to the turn!

25:00.760 --> 25:03.040
OK, here we go,
here we go, here we go.

25:03.040 --> 25:04.200
Come on, baby. Come on!

25:04.200 --> 25:05.680
Hold left, hold left.

25:05.680 --> 25:08.400
- Come on, Matthew, come on.
- We've got it.

25:08.400 --> 25:10.560
Find the gear, man! Yeah.

25:11.760 --> 25:14.680
- We've got it! - What did I
tell you about the tuk-tuk?

25:16.840 --> 25:19.760
- He cannot get past. - There's no way
he'll pass us on this.

25:21.440 --> 25:25.160
And here we are, that is a tea
factory. Stop down there.

25:25.160 --> 25:27.040
Next to do the unloading thing.
Let's go.

25:30.880 --> 25:32.240
We're in here, we're in here.

25:36.760 --> 25:39.760
That's it. Winner!

25:39.760 --> 25:41.440
Whoo! We got them.

25:41.440 --> 25:43.400
Good job.

25:43.400 --> 25:46.880
City car, tick. Sports car, tick.

25:46.880 --> 25:49.600
Load lugger, tick.

25:49.600 --> 25:51.320
There's nothing this car can't do.

25:52.560 --> 25:54.680
You're insane, do you know that?

25:54.680 --> 25:55.880
But I've got to hand it to you,

25:55.880 --> 25:58.680
and then more importantly,
I've got to hand it to this thing,

25:58.680 --> 26:01.040
I thought for sure,
with all that weight on there,

26:01.040 --> 26:03.760
we would have either flipped it over
or smoked the clutch,

26:03.760 --> 26:07.280
but we didn't flip it over
and we didn't smoke the clutch.

26:07.280 --> 26:09.600
So...I'm in.

26:09.600 --> 26:10.680
What's next?

26:10.680 --> 26:13.240
Oh! The Devil's Staircase.

26:13.240 --> 26:14.520
I'm out.

26:17.080 --> 26:20.400
Yes, the infamous
Devil's Staircase lay in wait.

26:22.320 --> 26:25.480
But even getting there would be
a tall order.

26:25.480 --> 26:30.680
The tuk-tuk's headlight is about
as powerful as a...

26:30.680 --> 26:32.600
..Victorian candle.

26:33.960 --> 26:36.120
And my windscreen wiper
doesn't work.

26:37.040 --> 26:38.640
So I really can't see anything,

26:38.640 --> 26:43.120
so this is as much
about guesswork as anything else.

26:43.120 --> 26:44.400
I can't see a thing.

26:44.400 --> 26:46.800
- What's this here? - BLEEP - hairpin.

26:49.320 --> 26:55.600
The tuk-tuk driver, at night
in Sri Lanka, is at risk.

26:55.600 --> 26:58.640
Matt, though, had other things
on his mind.

26:58.640 --> 27:00.560
Did you know
there could be elephants here?

27:00.560 --> 27:01.800
We're driving right by them.

27:03.440 --> 27:06.840
You know they purr to communicate,
like cats?

27:06.840 --> 27:08.600
How cute is that?
CAR HORN BLARES

27:08.600 --> 27:10.440
Will you concentrate on the road?!

27:10.440 --> 27:15.080
They're great swimmers, they can use
their trunks as snorkels.

27:15.080 --> 27:18.000
And they hear through their feet.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.880
And did you know they're the only
mammal...

27:20.880 --> 27:23.040
- CAR HORN BLARES
..that can't jump? - God's sake!

27:23.040 --> 27:24.640
When are we going to see
an elephant?

27:24.640 --> 27:27.280
Will you shut up about
fobbing elephants?!

27:30.160 --> 27:31.920
What has he got against elephants?

27:37.160 --> 27:41.040
The next day, we reached it -
the Devil's Staircase...

27:43.400 --> 27:45.880
..where my final challenge
would be off-roading.

27:48.680 --> 27:51.480
One of the most dangerous trails
in Sri Lanka,

27:51.480 --> 27:56.400
the Devil's Staircase is a 14km hike
over steep, uneven terrain.

27:58.240 --> 28:00.760
A challenge even for a proper 4x4.

28:00.760 --> 28:04.760
Conquering it would be ultimate
proof of our tuk-tuk's versatility.

28:08.480 --> 28:09.520
Look at this!

28:11.160 --> 28:12.320
Wow!

28:14.360 --> 28:15.760
Proper off-road vehicles.

28:19.240 --> 28:22.200
Who needs a Land Rover Defender
when you can have a tuk-tuk?

28:25.960 --> 28:29.520
I told you the tuk-tuk would make
light work of this.

28:29.520 --> 28:30.560
It's easy.

28:30.560 --> 28:32.080
- CRUNCHING AND BANGING
- Oh!

28:32.080 --> 28:33.800
BLEEP!

28:34.840 --> 28:36.040
Jesus!

28:37.520 --> 28:41.960
Right. So this is clearly
the Devil's Staircase.

28:43.640 --> 28:46.040
And it was clearly no place
for a tuk-tuk.

28:49.880 --> 28:51.320
What the...? Oh!

28:51.320 --> 28:54.800
Oh! This is insane.

28:54.800 --> 28:57.960
Oh, my head.
Harris, I'm going to kill you!

28:57.960 --> 29:00.840
Think how it will feel
once you've struggled through it.

29:00.840 --> 29:01.880
BANGING

29:07.760 --> 29:09.160
Unbelievable.

29:10.600 --> 29:12.080
Don't think he's very happy.

29:13.080 --> 29:14.120
Go!

29:15.560 --> 29:18.240
Come on, little tuk-tuk.
Do not let me down, please.

29:21.160 --> 29:23.800
Oh, dear. That's harsh.

29:23.800 --> 29:27.120
Right, this is...

29:27.120 --> 29:31.520
I don't know how much more of this
punishment this thing can take.

29:31.520 --> 29:34.200
This is an absolute
assault on the vehicle.

29:34.200 --> 29:39.480
The gearbox, the engine,
the driveshafts, the springs,

29:39.480 --> 29:42.600
such as they are, or were.

29:42.600 --> 29:44.560
Ohh!

29:44.560 --> 29:49.960
I've got a whole list of new noises
back here. Brand-new stuff.

29:49.960 --> 29:51.760
Yeah, so have I,
not one of them is good.

29:53.160 --> 29:55.520
But still, Chris led us
further up the trail.

29:57.360 --> 29:59.080
Jesus! People live up here!

30:00.360 --> 30:01.520
Hello.

30:01.520 --> 30:03.080
No, I'm not for hire.

30:03.080 --> 30:04.520
What on Earth...?

30:05.960 --> 30:10.880
And while he was unwilling to give
up, his tuk-tuk was starting to.

30:10.880 --> 30:12.880
Oh, my God!

30:16.560 --> 30:17.800
And he's lost a gear.

30:26.160 --> 30:29.440
I don't know that she's long
for this world, this little tuk-tuk.

30:31.240 --> 30:34.000
Quite hard to tell what's going on
here, but I feel I've got

30:34.000 --> 30:37.360
a bit of a puncture or something
at the back, something's not right.

30:37.360 --> 30:39.760
I will not admit it to Matthew.

30:40.920 --> 30:42.840
You've got a flat,
you've got a flat.

30:47.040 --> 30:49.480
Yeah, that's a flat tyre all right.

30:49.480 --> 30:52.320
Now, normally, I would be mortified
about having to change a tyre,

30:52.320 --> 30:54.080
but this is the tuk-tuk.

30:54.080 --> 30:57.240
It's the easiest car in the world
to work on, so watch this.

30:57.240 --> 31:00.440
There you go. There's the tyre. See?

31:00.440 --> 31:02.760
Such a clever vehicle,
doesn't even need a jack.

31:02.760 --> 31:05.440
So I'll just tip it up
and you shove that underneath?

31:05.440 --> 31:07.080
Yeah, I think that should do it.

31:07.080 --> 31:09.000
- Yeah? - Yeah. - OK.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Up you go.
Wait there, wait there.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.360
Wait there. A little bit more.

31:12.360 --> 31:14.720
- No, Chris. - That's it.
A little bit more. - No.

31:31.960 --> 31:33.440
You just wrecked my tuk-tuk.

31:35.960 --> 31:37.560
You are such an idiot!

31:45.280 --> 31:47.560
HE STRAINS

31:47.560 --> 31:49.760
Do you mind if I just stand
and watch this?

31:49.760 --> 31:52.160
- I can go back and get mine.
I know mine runs. - Yours runs?

31:52.160 --> 31:54.080
- I'm sure of it. - So you've destroyed
mine,

31:54.080 --> 31:56.160
- but you can go back and get
yours. - No, no, no.

31:56.160 --> 31:57.520
- No, you destroyed yours. - No.

31:57.520 --> 32:01.400
You destroyed this. I said,
"That's too far." You said, "What?"

32:01.400 --> 32:03.920
Are you accepting any
part of responsibility for this?

32:03.920 --> 32:06.680
I'll take... No. I won't. OK, fine.

32:06.680 --> 32:10.320
WE pushed your car off a cliff
in an attempt to jack it up.

32:11.280 --> 32:14.840
But more importantly,
had we killed the tuk-tuk?

32:14.840 --> 32:17.920
OK, how close are you going
to stand to it when I start it?

32:17.920 --> 32:18.960
OK, go.

32:20.280 --> 32:21.760
ENGINE ATTEMPTS TO TURN OVER

32:24.440 --> 32:28.200
Please, come on!
Come on, little tuk-tuk.

32:28.200 --> 32:29.520
ENGINE NEARLY CATCHES

32:29.520 --> 32:31.240
- Oh! - Yeah, yeah.

32:31.240 --> 32:33.800
OK, give it a little rest.

32:33.800 --> 32:34.880
That's enough. Go!

32:37.120 --> 32:40.040
Come on, just catch.
One little spark ignite, please!

32:41.840 --> 32:43.680
Well, it wants to. It wants to.

32:43.680 --> 32:45.800
- Come on, baby. - It so wants to start.

32:46.960 --> 32:48.840
ENGINE STARTS AND REVS SMOOTHLY

32:48.840 --> 32:50.840
THEY LAUGH AND CHEER

32:50.840 --> 32:53.960
- ENGINE REVS SMOOTHLY
- Yes!

32:53.960 --> 32:56.840
It's on fire. I'm just kidding,
I'm just kidding.

32:56.840 --> 32:58.320
MATT LAUGHS

32:58.320 --> 33:01.760
- Wow! Indestructible.
- It didn't even break the windshield.

33:01.760 --> 33:03.800
ENGINE REVS
I mean, it's not as pretty

33:03.800 --> 33:05.640
as it was before, but it looks...

33:05.640 --> 33:07.960
Can you believe it?
What have you got there?

33:07.960 --> 33:09.920
- Oh, look at that. - Hello. - Thank you.

33:11.400 --> 33:15.080
- Where did he come from?
- It's from the producers. - Oh!

33:15.080 --> 33:17.400
"So you believe the tuk-tuk
is the most versatile

33:17.400 --> 33:22.240
"car in the world, now prove
it by driving to India."

33:23.560 --> 33:24.960
- India?! - Hmm.

33:26.440 --> 33:29.080
Well, but isn't Sri Lanka an island?

33:32.560 --> 33:34.000
APPLAUSE

33:35.120 --> 33:36.200
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

33:42.280 --> 33:45.040
I still can't believe it
started again. I can't believe it.

33:45.040 --> 33:46.760
All right, we'll pick that up later

33:46.760 --> 33:49.520
where things get a little drowny,
sinky.

33:49.520 --> 33:52.600
But now, it's time to put
a Star in a Reasonably Fast Car.

33:52.600 --> 33:56.640
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
to the sofa, Professor Green.

33:56.640 --> 33:58.680
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

34:00.600 --> 34:02.720
- Welcome, buddy. - All right.

34:02.720 --> 34:04.280
Thanks. Good to see you.

34:08.440 --> 34:09.480
All right.

34:10.480 --> 34:13.000
Now, you, you're
really into your driving, right?

34:13.000 --> 34:15.840
I do like driving, yeah. Despite
the fact that I live in Lewisham,

34:15.840 --> 34:18.520
and the most of my time
is spent driving between Lewisham

34:18.520 --> 34:22.400
and Shoreditch, which means
a maximum speed of about 17mph.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.080
What was your first car?

34:25.080 --> 34:29.120
First car I had,
I bought a Polo to pass my test in

34:29.120 --> 34:33.560
and got my missus at the time
to teach me to drive.

34:33.560 --> 34:36.120
That must have been
good for the relationship?

34:36.120 --> 34:38.040
We are no longer together.

34:38.040 --> 34:39.120
LAUGHTER

34:39.120 --> 34:40.560
But, yeah, no, I passed in that car.

34:40.560 --> 34:43.560
But it was funny,
the first day that I passed my test.

34:43.560 --> 34:45.679
You give your provisional
licence over

34:45.679 --> 34:48.280
and you get given a certificate
to say that you've passed,

34:48.280 --> 34:50.600
which I left at home
because I'm always losing things.

34:50.600 --> 34:52.880
I got bloody pulled
over by the police, didn't I?

34:52.880 --> 34:55.560
And you've got an old copper
who is half all right,

34:55.560 --> 34:58.200
and then you've got the young copper
who is a complete knob.

34:58.200 --> 35:01.880
LAUGHTER

35:01.880 --> 35:05.080
And so he's trying to go... I give
him the story about, you know,

35:05.080 --> 35:08.040
"I've left the piece of paper at
home. My licence has been sent off.

35:08.040 --> 35:09.280
"I only passed my test today."

35:09.280 --> 35:11.360
And he's like, "Yeah, but you're
Professor Green.

35:11.360 --> 35:12.640
"Is this all you're driving?"

35:12.640 --> 35:15.080
I wish he would have pulled
me up a couple of months later

35:15.080 --> 35:17.520
- when I had my SLS and then,
I'd be like, - "BLEEP - copper!"

35:17.520 --> 35:19.880
LAUGHTER

35:19.880 --> 35:22.400
And as far as... Speaking about
cars, what do you drive now?

35:22.400 --> 35:27.680
At the moment, I've got a G-Class,
G wagon. I did have a GTS.

35:27.680 --> 35:30.400
And before that I had an SLS,
which are both lovely,

35:30.400 --> 35:33.160
you're, like, quarter of a turn
and you're around a corner,

35:33.160 --> 35:35.800
whereas a G wagon
is a little bit more laborious.

35:35.800 --> 35:38.360
And I've heard that you do...
you write music in there?

35:38.360 --> 35:39.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:39.440 --> 35:41.520
I come up with most of my ideas
in the car,

35:41.520 --> 35:43.960
which my girlfriend hates
because I just listen to the same

35:43.960 --> 35:47.080
instrumental over and over and over
and she's there like,

35:47.080 --> 35:48.960
"Oh, my God!" You know what I mean.

35:48.960 --> 35:51.760
It's as good as
Japanese water torture for her.

35:51.760 --> 35:54.560
But I love it. And there's just
me kind of, like, humming along,

35:54.560 --> 35:57.640
- coming up with ideas as I drive.
- Good for you. - It makes me happy.

35:57.640 --> 35:59.920
Nothing makes me
happier than writing a good lyric.

35:59.920 --> 36:02.800
All right, now. How did it go
training out there with Chris?

36:02.800 --> 36:06.800
I heard you were...
let's go with confident.

36:06.800 --> 36:10.720
No, I wouldn't say confident.
I'm just not scared. Yeah.

36:11.880 --> 36:14.720
- I thought that was you. - Fearless as
opposed to fearful,

36:14.720 --> 36:16.480
which is I think what Chris
probably was.

36:16.480 --> 36:19.400
I'm not a good passenger anyway.
But, no.

36:19.400 --> 36:22.160
You can't teach that kind of speed

36:22.160 --> 36:24.120
and he demonstrated it from
the start.

36:24.120 --> 36:26.080
Well, let's take a look.
I can't wait.

36:26.080 --> 36:28.440
- Professor Green,
welcome to the track. - Yep.

36:28.440 --> 36:30.880
You've not driven a mono gearbox
since when?

36:30.880 --> 36:32.600
It's probably been about four years.

36:32.600 --> 36:35.640
Well, at least you're not doing it
with a load of cameras on you

36:35.640 --> 36:37.320
- and a TV audience? - No.

36:37.320 --> 36:41.320
Or around a racetrack, where
the time is actually important.

36:41.320 --> 36:45.200
- Let's go. Away and above is first.
- Yep. - Let's give it a go.

36:47.680 --> 36:50.920
What's the fastest you've
been in a car?

36:50.920 --> 36:52.640
- About 170mph. - 170?!

36:52.640 --> 36:54.800
- Where? - Can't tell you.

36:54.800 --> 36:57.360
- On the public highway? - No.

36:58.680 --> 37:01.680
Now we're going into this little
turning here, which is quite tough

37:01.680 --> 37:04.040
and this is quite slippery here.
You'll feel that.

37:07.120 --> 37:08.440
Ah!

37:08.440 --> 37:10.480
LAUGHTER

37:10.480 --> 37:12.840
- It was fun. - It was going so well.

37:14.080 --> 37:16.560
So when did you start
riding around in cars?

37:16.560 --> 37:20.400
- I crashed a Mini Cooper when I was
about 11. I'm not sure... - 11?!

37:20.400 --> 37:21.720
..who owned the vehicle.

37:21.720 --> 37:24.120
You're not sure you owned it?!

37:24.120 --> 37:27.520
Oh, that's quick. That's quick.

37:27.520 --> 37:30.800
- GLASS SHATTERS
- That will be a landing light.

37:30.800 --> 37:33.680
Keep going, keep going, keep going,
keep going! Good speed!

37:33.680 --> 37:36.160
This is the slippery bit.
This is the slippery bit.

37:36.160 --> 37:38.800
How much speed can you carry without
spinning? Left, left, left.

37:38.800 --> 37:40.800
That's quite quick,
we might be off there.

37:43.920 --> 37:45.520
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

37:46.920 --> 37:48.040
It's slippery!

37:51.040 --> 37:52.080
You are fearless.

37:52.080 --> 37:54.560
- So, you're going to go fast? - Mm-hm.

37:54.560 --> 37:58.200
One thing I can't help
people to do is to not be scared.

37:58.200 --> 38:02.040
- And you are quite clearly not
scared of going fast, are you? - Nah.

38:02.040 --> 38:03.080
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

38:07.280 --> 38:08.480
Well, clearly not scared.

38:08.480 --> 38:11.360
You know, usually...usually
when there's those kinds of spins

38:11.360 --> 38:13.800
that many times, the people get...

38:13.800 --> 38:16.280
- Nah. - You're cool as a cucumber.
- You've just got to let it go.

38:16.280 --> 38:20.000
Easily the liveliest training
session I've ever been part of.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.720
Lively, yeah, yeah. He needs a good
scare every now and then.

38:22.720 --> 38:24.600
Yeah, it's good.
It makes you feel alive.

38:26.040 --> 38:29.320
All right, now I've got to ask, on
your neck. Yeah. What does it say?

38:29.320 --> 38:31.640
- It says "Lucky". - Lucky? - Yeah.

38:31.640 --> 38:32.920
Is there a story behind that?

38:32.920 --> 38:36.160
Well, there is. I've got loads of
like notes to self,

38:36.160 --> 38:37.400
like, "Care less".

38:37.400 --> 38:40.240
I should probably get "Go to bed"
written somewhere on me as well,

38:40.240 --> 38:41.960
that would be a useful piece
of advice

38:41.960 --> 38:43.520
at certain points in the weekend.

38:44.560 --> 38:46.800
But no, "Lucky" was just, like,
you know,

38:46.800 --> 38:49.000
things are bad
but they could be worse.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.440
But, yeah, two weeks after
I got the "Lucky" tattoo, I got

38:51.440 --> 38:52.600
stabbed in my neck.

38:54.640 --> 38:56.680
- OK. - So it depends on how you
want to look at it.

38:56.680 --> 38:59.360
Because not many people get poked
in the neck and live because of

38:59.360 --> 39:02.160
all the mechanics. The bottle went
right past the carotid artery.

39:02.160 --> 39:05.000
And if it had hit that, I would have
bled out in four minutes.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.240
When I came out of surgery,

39:06.240 --> 39:08.640
I said, "Oh, thanks for putting
my tattoo back together."

39:08.640 --> 39:10.760
And the doctor laughed and he went,
"No, thank you."

39:10.760 --> 39:12.160
And I went, "Why?" And he was like,

39:12.160 --> 39:14.560
"Cos I knew where
everything was meant to go."

39:14.560 --> 39:15.640
LAUGHTER

39:15.640 --> 39:18.280
- So lucky you got it?
- So, lucky again, yeah.

39:18.280 --> 39:20.440
I was lucky to walk away from it.

39:20.440 --> 39:23.280
And, yeah, the only
people that have cut me

39:23.280 --> 39:26.560
since have been doctors
and it's been professionally done.

39:26.560 --> 39:28.600
That's more ideal, yeah.

39:28.600 --> 39:31.080
Although, that...
that didn't turn out to well for me.

39:31.080 --> 39:32.920
I had major operation complications

39:32.920 --> 39:35.600
but you don't want my medical
history, this is a car show.

39:35.600 --> 39:37.120
LAUGHTER
Yeah.

39:37.120 --> 39:40.320
- Where you in like a bad car crash?
- No, I wasn't.

39:40.320 --> 39:43.120
Some dickhead DHL driver...

39:43.120 --> 39:44.840
I was having...

39:44.840 --> 39:48.240
- LAUGHTER
- I was having two cars dropped off.

39:48.240 --> 39:51.120
It was the DHL driver,
he'd been outside my house

39:51.120 --> 39:54.000
for about ten minutes and the reason
why cars were being dropped off

39:54.000 --> 39:56.440
was because me and a bunch
of people were going to do a gig.

39:56.440 --> 39:59.400
The guy's been sat there for ten
minutes with his foot on the brake.

39:59.400 --> 40:01.520
But the cars have got Eco,
so the engine's off.

40:01.520 --> 40:04.240
So I come out, I go, "Mate, how long
until the second car gets here?"

40:04.240 --> 40:06.080
He says, "Oh,
only a couple of minutes, mate.

40:06.080 --> 40:07.640
"By the time I've done
the paperwork,

40:07.640 --> 40:10.560
"the other car will be here," and he
kind of gestures to the paperwork

40:10.560 --> 40:13.560
on the other seat. I said, "Sweet,
I'm going to run back in the house

40:13.560 --> 40:16.720
"and grab everyone. So I've started
to walk, like, diagonally in front

40:16.720 --> 40:18.920
of the car, back to the pavement.
A big VA bi-turbo.

40:18.920 --> 40:20.360
I've just heard "Brrmmm-phhfff!"

40:20.360 --> 40:22.680
What he's done is, as he's lent over
to get the paperwork,

40:22.680 --> 40:24.080
he's taken his foot off the brake.

40:24.080 --> 40:26.880
He's panicked, hearing the engine
start, and instead of slamming

40:26.880 --> 40:29.480
his foot on the brake,
he slammed it on the accelerator.

40:29.480 --> 40:33.440
Hit me... Yeah, I am proper lucky.
Hit me in the back.

40:33.440 --> 40:35.840
I managed to twist, I think
this comes from my skating days

40:35.840 --> 40:37.160
and learning how to fall over.

40:37.160 --> 40:39.200
He hit me in the back, my first
reaction was,

40:39.200 --> 40:41.760
"Get your hands on the bonnet,"
and I lifted myself up.

40:41.760 --> 40:44.920
And I managed to get everything,
apart from my left leg out of the

40:44.920 --> 40:48.480
way before he squashed me between
his car and the back of my SLS.

40:48.480 --> 40:50.280
My lovely SLS.

40:50.280 --> 40:52.240
He come out, like,
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."

40:52.240 --> 40:54.640
And the worst thing was
I was in shock up until that point

40:54.640 --> 40:56.920
because when he said sorry,
and I saw he was crying.

40:56.920 --> 40:59.000
- I went, "What the
- BLEEP - are YOU crying for?"

40:59.000 --> 41:02.160
LAUGHTER

41:02.160 --> 41:04.800
And then all of a sudden
the pain set in.

41:04.800 --> 41:06.880
And then I got gas and air
from First Response

41:06.880 --> 41:09.640
and the bloody ambulance crew
asked me for a picture.

41:09.640 --> 41:11.160
I'm...
LAUGHTER

41:11.160 --> 41:12.920
My leg looks like that.

41:12.920 --> 41:14.760
I'm on gas and air,
so I'm off my nut, ain't I?

41:14.760 --> 41:17.000
So I'm like, "Yeah,
of course you can have a picture."

41:17.000 --> 41:18.400
So there's a selfie online of me

41:18.400 --> 41:20.800
with, like, First Response
in the ambulance, like that,

41:20.800 --> 41:22.680
on the gas and air.

41:22.680 --> 41:24.840
LAUGHTER

41:26.480 --> 41:29.400
All right, shall we take a look
at your lap, what do you think?

41:29.400 --> 41:31.720
Come on, then. How did it
go on your own, how do you feel?

41:31.720 --> 41:33.280
Do you know what? It got better.

41:33.280 --> 41:36.280
But do you know what?
I'm not going to make any excuses.

41:36.280 --> 41:38.920
All right!
LAUGHTER

41:38.920 --> 41:40.000
Did you hear that?

41:40.000 --> 41:41.080
Let's take a look.

41:42.880 --> 41:45.320
Professor Green, off the line.

41:45.320 --> 41:50.320
I wish I had my nan in the car with
me now. She'd absolutely love this.

41:50.320 --> 41:51.920
I'm sure she would.

41:51.920 --> 41:55.080
Braking hard into the second corner.

41:55.080 --> 41:57.320
Look at that, he's pretty
aggressive on the throttle,

41:57.320 --> 41:59.280
using the full width of the circuit.

41:59.280 --> 42:03.600
How the hell am I meant to be
a pro athlete, like Chris Hoy,

42:03.600 --> 42:07.720
who's got nerves of steel
and also motor racing experience?

42:07.720 --> 42:09.440
Get your excuses out early, son.

42:09.440 --> 42:10.960
I think this is a bloody set-up.

42:11.960 --> 42:14.640
Again, very,
very hard braking into Hammerhead.

42:14.640 --> 42:16.240
The direction change is good.

42:16.240 --> 42:18.960
Let the car run wide,
let the car run wide.

42:18.960 --> 42:21.040
Looks like he's snagged
third a bit early.

42:21.040 --> 42:23.160
Here we go,
now we can floor it again.

42:24.720 --> 42:27.760
This back straight
shorter than you think.

42:27.760 --> 42:29.000
Why am I in third?

42:29.000 --> 42:30.240
I can get up to fourth here.

42:33.400 --> 42:35.960
Here we go, any brake lights?
Any brake lights?

42:35.960 --> 42:38.440
None.
So that was good without a lift.

42:38.440 --> 42:41.520
- Here we go. - Second to last, we had
a bit of grass here, didn't we?

42:43.640 --> 42:47.040
Now, over the last corner, Gambon.

42:47.040 --> 42:49.960
- Oh! - Woohoo!

42:49.960 --> 42:52.680
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

42:52.680 --> 42:56.400
Style points right there. That
was some style points at the end.

42:56.400 --> 43:00.160
I'd love to say it was intentional,
but it definitely wasn't, yeah.

43:00.160 --> 43:03.400
Yeah, OK.
So, who do you want to beat?

43:04.600 --> 43:05.640
Shazia Mirza.

43:07.240 --> 43:08.600
LAUGHTER

43:08.600 --> 43:11.920
- No, Tinie Tempah. - You want to beat
Tinie? - I want to beat Tinie.

43:11.920 --> 43:14.880
Well, I thought
it looked pretty quick.

43:14.880 --> 43:17.520
It was definitely entertaining.

43:17.520 --> 43:21.080
And it looked very confident.
OK, here we go.

43:21.080 --> 43:25.640
Professor Green, you did it one
minute...

43:25.640 --> 43:27.360
..40...

43:27.360 --> 43:30.040
- ..six...flat. - OK.

43:30.040 --> 43:33.480
That's respectable.
APPLAUSE

43:35.840 --> 43:37.600
With similar conditions,

43:37.600 --> 43:39.680
I'll take that. I'll take that.

43:39.680 --> 43:41.600
That was fantastic. Congratulations.

43:41.600 --> 43:45.120
- I mean, in those conditions,
that's... - It's all right.

43:45.120 --> 43:47.200
Ladies and gentlemen,
Professor Green!

43:47.200 --> 43:48.480
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

43:57.440 --> 43:59.640
OK.

43:59.640 --> 44:01.640
Now it's time to head back
to Sri Lanka,

44:01.640 --> 44:05.560
where Chris's tuk-tuk had somehow
survived falling off a mountain

44:05.560 --> 44:09.120
and we had been told to head to
a crossing called Adam's Bridge.

44:09.120 --> 44:11.560
Our challenge - to drive to India.

44:18.160 --> 44:19.600
The thing is, Adam's Bridge,

44:19.600 --> 44:25.440
the 18-mile causeway that would get
us to India, was some distance away.

44:25.440 --> 44:29.400
In fact, we needed to head
250 miles up island

44:29.400 --> 44:33.120
to Sri Lanka's
remote north-western coast.

44:39.320 --> 44:42.080
I feel pretty sure that I'd have
read about a bridge that

44:42.080 --> 44:43.960
connected Sri Lanka and India.

44:43.960 --> 44:46.080
You know, you worry too much.

44:46.080 --> 44:48.040
We drove to Adam's Bridge.

44:48.040 --> 44:50.840
We drive across Adam's Bridge -
thank you very much, Adam -

44:50.840 --> 44:53.280
and we're in India for lunch.
What's the big deal?

44:57.640 --> 45:01.880
But while I was upbeat
about our marathon challenge,

45:01.880 --> 45:04.520
Chris, for some reason, wasn't.

45:04.520 --> 45:07.120
- Hey! - Look, what is the matter
with you?

45:07.120 --> 45:08.800
We were on the road, buddy.

45:12.120 --> 45:14.640
And that's because after
Matt's hill-rolling antics,

45:14.640 --> 45:17.240
my tuk-tuk was no
longer in the best shape.

45:18.240 --> 45:21.200
Truth be told, it wasn't
the right shape at all.

45:23.040 --> 45:26.840
- How's it feeling? - It feels 98%
broken, but it's still going.

45:26.840 --> 45:28.960
It is shocking
that it's still going.

45:28.960 --> 45:30.760
No thanks to what you did to it.

45:30.760 --> 45:32.160
I didn't do anything.

45:32.160 --> 45:33.920
You pushed it off a cliff.

45:33.920 --> 45:36.560
Who changed the tyre,
close to the edge of a cliff?

45:36.560 --> 45:39.520
Just because I stopped in a bad
place doesn't mean you have

45:39.520 --> 45:41.200
the right to throw my car off it.

45:41.200 --> 45:43.200
At some point
you have to accept some blame.

45:44.280 --> 45:48.360
- I think what's happened is that
you've become slightly moody. - Moody?

45:48.360 --> 45:51.880
- Slightly. - As I'm talking to you,
I'm getting lower

45:51.880 --> 45:55.480
- because the seat is moving, can you
see that? - It looks kind of wobbly.

45:56.480 --> 45:59.000
Anyhow, it's still running,
which is testament

45:59.000 --> 46:00.800
to the brilliance of the tuk-tuk.

46:04.880 --> 46:07.000
And thanks to that brilliance,

46:07.000 --> 46:09.120
we were well on our way
to our destination.

46:12.360 --> 46:18.240
Until that is, Matt brought us
to another abrupt halt.

46:18.240 --> 46:20.640
Pull over, pull over, pull over!

46:21.840 --> 46:25.800
- Shut off your engine, shut off your
engine. - Why? - Shut off your engine.

46:28.840 --> 46:29.920
Look.

46:39.680 --> 46:40.840
I can't believe it.

46:43.880 --> 46:44.920
TUKTUK CREAKS

46:46.080 --> 46:47.320
Shh!

46:47.320 --> 46:49.040
They'll hear you.

46:49.040 --> 46:50.920
Hey! MOUTHS: Big ears.

46:56.440 --> 46:59.400
I hate to break this to you but I
don't think they're coming, Matt.

47:02.480 --> 47:05.040
Why not?
This is an elephant crossing, look.

47:05.040 --> 47:10.120
Hopefully it's one like on the sign
there, a mother and a baby.

47:10.120 --> 47:13.320
Maybe it's two elephants the same
size with one further away.

47:16.560 --> 47:17.840
Yeah, that could be true.

47:21.480 --> 47:23.600
- But they're not coming, Matt. - Shh!

47:23.600 --> 47:26.320
- I want to see an elephant!
- I know you do, but I can't help you

47:26.320 --> 47:31.000
because I cannot magic an elephant
out of what is largely a beach area.

47:31.000 --> 47:32.960
Why would there be an elephant
crossing sign

47:32.960 --> 47:34.960
- if elephants do not cross here?
- I don't know.

47:34.960 --> 47:37.360
I can't help you, I'm really sad
for you

47:37.360 --> 47:39.560
but we've got to get going. Come on.

47:40.720 --> 47:41.960
I'm very disappointed.

47:44.200 --> 47:48.360
With no sign of Dumbo or Nelly,
Matt reluctantly agreed

47:48.360 --> 47:49.520
to get back on the road.

47:53.480 --> 47:55.040
I'm sorry about your elephant.

47:55.040 --> 47:57.400
I want you to see an elephant.

47:57.400 --> 47:59.040
But we are here to drive...

48:10.320 --> 48:12.560
I don't think he's very happy.

48:12.560 --> 48:14.440
But, then, neither was my tuk-tuk.

48:17.200 --> 48:18.640
And limping on after Matt...

48:21.320 --> 48:25.560
..it was three long,
painful hours...

48:25.560 --> 48:27.440
Oh!

48:27.440 --> 48:30.400
..before we finally
reached Mannar...

48:30.400 --> 48:32.320
There's an elephant crossing,
there.

48:32.320 --> 48:34.200
That's a cow.

48:34.200 --> 48:36.640
..the starting point
of our bridge to India.

48:40.560 --> 48:43.920
It's absolutely ruined.

48:43.920 --> 48:46.480
The chassis flex is
so bad that I no longer need to use

48:46.480 --> 48:49.040
the handlebars to steer,
I can just lift one up

48:49.040 --> 48:52.200
and the other side up,
and it changes direction.

48:54.000 --> 48:57.400
I've seen some rough cars in my day
and that's amongst the roughest.

48:58.600 --> 49:01.720
- We must be getting close, right?
- We are really nearly there.

49:01.720 --> 49:03.600
We're going to get
to the bridge for certain -

49:03.600 --> 49:06.200
whether we get across it,
that's another question.

49:08.640 --> 49:10.840
At last! We had reached the coast...

49:16.520 --> 49:18.960
- Yeah! - This looks a bit bridge-like.

49:21.040 --> 49:23.800
..where we soon discovered
that Adam's Bridge

49:23.800 --> 49:26.320
wasn't quite what we'd anticipated.

49:33.240 --> 49:38.360
This is Adam's Bridge? So what are
we supposed to do, swim to India?

49:41.240 --> 49:42.960
We were.

49:42.960 --> 49:47.240
Thought to have once connected
Sri Lanka to India by land,

49:47.240 --> 49:51.840
Adam's Bridge is now a chain of tiny
semi submerged islands,

49:51.840 --> 49:53.440
stretching out to sea.

49:54.640 --> 49:58.720
So if our tuk-tuks were going to
reach India, then, yes,

49:58.720 --> 50:00.080
they would have to learn to swim.

50:06.320 --> 50:10.200
Combing the boat yards of Mannar
for anything to keep us afloat,

50:10.200 --> 50:13.440
the next morning
we were ready for the voyage.

50:17.720 --> 50:21.640
And while I had chosen the rigid
dependability of old oil drums,

50:21.640 --> 50:27.560
Chris had raided the local beach
club for two inflatable hot dogs.

50:27.560 --> 50:30.640
I'm telling you, I just don't think
that that's the right design.

50:30.640 --> 50:33.360
How many oil tankers have you seen
that are inflatable?

50:33.360 --> 50:35.520
How many big ships, cruise ships?
None!

50:37.680 --> 50:40.160
Well, I also know a little
bit about a lot of things, Matt.

50:40.160 --> 50:42.480
And you're living in the past.

50:42.480 --> 50:43.520
This is the future.

50:45.840 --> 50:48.960
Matt's tuk-tuk looks like he's just
strapped two North Korean

50:48.960 --> 50:52.480
missiles to the side of it
and put an outboard on the back.

50:54.640 --> 50:58.240
Whatever! At least
missiles are easy to launch.

51:07.760 --> 51:10.240
OK. Now we start the motor.

51:11.720 --> 51:16.680
That's what I'm talking about. See?

51:16.680 --> 51:19.640
Easy. In the future,
on the other hand...

51:19.640 --> 51:21.320
Right, here we go, then.

51:21.320 --> 51:24.040
So, I will deploy my buoyancy aids.

51:26.280 --> 51:29.240
That means lowering the winch
and pumping at the same time.

51:31.720 --> 51:32.960
HE GROANS WITH EFFORT

51:34.920 --> 51:36.200
Come on!

51:36.200 --> 51:38.400
- Genius design. - Sure!

51:39.640 --> 51:40.840
Genius design.

51:42.880 --> 51:45.760
Finally afloat,
it was time to set sail.

51:45.760 --> 51:48.200
India or bust!

51:57.360 --> 51:59.320
A floating tuk-tuk.

52:01.760 --> 52:05.080
Who'd have thunk it?
Huh? Tuk-tuks in the open sea.

52:06.160 --> 52:09.920
- This is great! - I'm not really
a seafaring type of person.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.440
I don't like the ocean,
I like swimming pools, cos there's

52:13.440 --> 52:16.560
nothing in a swimming pool
that's going to bite you.

52:16.560 --> 52:20.760
You know, I was born doing this. My
dad had boats, my stepdad had boats.

52:20.760 --> 52:23.720
I'm from New England.
Everybody's got a boat there.

52:26.320 --> 52:29.440
I can't get my posture quite right
and what's really amazing is

52:29.440 --> 52:33.280
the front wheel actually acts
as a front rudder, so you actually

52:33.280 --> 52:37.040
have to steer it with two things
which is a total pain in the arse.

52:37.040 --> 52:38.760
Slightly shaky start aside,

52:38.760 --> 52:43.520
though, the intrepid tuk-tuk was
once again proving its versatility.

52:44.640 --> 52:47.320
And following the trail of islands,

52:47.320 --> 52:49.040
our goal was the ninth,

52:49.040 --> 52:51.200
the border with India.

52:51.200 --> 52:52.920
I think that's the first island.

52:52.920 --> 52:54.240
I think you might be right.

52:54.240 --> 52:57.280
This must be how
Christopher Columbus felt.

52:59.360 --> 53:01.680
Hey, Chris,
here's island number two, homey.

53:03.440 --> 53:06.280
As we left dry land
even further behind us, though...

53:08.880 --> 53:10.960
Right, heads-up -
we've got some waves.

53:10.960 --> 53:14.240
..the ocean soon became a lot
more oceany.

53:14.240 --> 53:16.960
Whoa! Let's get a little separation.

53:18.360 --> 53:20.120
We are
going to feel waves over the barrel.

53:21.240 --> 53:24.880
- Where's he going? - Whoa, whoa,
don't go too far out to sea.

53:24.880 --> 53:26.640
This feels so stable.

53:26.640 --> 53:28.640
Stay close to the shore.

53:28.640 --> 53:30.400
Where are you going?

53:30.400 --> 53:32.360
It's fine.

53:32.360 --> 53:34.440
I don't know why I tried to help
him, I really don't.

53:34.440 --> 53:37.960
Soon enough, Chris
and his hot dogs were in trouble.

53:41.960 --> 53:45.200
Are you OK? That looks like it's
sinking to me.

53:45.200 --> 53:46.720
It's fine.

53:48.640 --> 53:51.000
Your front mudguard is now
underwater.

53:52.840 --> 53:55.320
Yeah, I'm not sure this is fine,
actually.

53:55.320 --> 53:58.120
A lot of water coming in right now.

53:59.960 --> 54:01.200
It doesn't look fine to me.

54:03.400 --> 54:04.880
I think I'm OK.

54:15.080 --> 54:16.840
- Not looking good! - What?

54:24.640 --> 54:27.360
- Can I have a lift, please?
- What, you want to get in my boat?

54:27.360 --> 54:29.360
Do you think you can do it
quite quickly?

54:33.840 --> 54:35.400
You've got my pants wet!

54:38.400 --> 54:40.840
With Chris forced to abandon ship,

54:40.840 --> 54:42.920
we were down to a single boat.

54:42.920 --> 54:46.360
My boat, my design, oil drums.
I told him!

54:46.360 --> 54:50.200
What do you think happened?

54:50.200 --> 54:51.920
I think my inflatable sides

54:51.920 --> 54:54.280
caught against the jagged bodywork,

54:54.280 --> 54:56.720
which had become jagged because...

54:56.720 --> 54:58.640
Because I pushed it off the cliff.

54:58.640 --> 55:00.720
- Yeah. - But I didn't mean to push
it off the cliff.

55:00.720 --> 55:02.760
- No, of course you didn't.
- It was an accident.

55:04.280 --> 55:05.960
Yeah. I'm very sad.

55:05.960 --> 55:08.720
All right, so what do you think?

55:08.720 --> 55:10.960
Shall we give it a little blessing?

55:10.960 --> 55:13.840
Oh, it's got a blessing, let's get
out of here, let's head to India.

55:18.600 --> 55:20.200
I thought you said
you knew a little bit

55:20.200 --> 55:21.880
about a lot of things
but your boat sank.

55:23.040 --> 55:25.480
Well, that obviously
wasn't one of them, was it?

55:27.760 --> 55:30.720
But while Chris still mourned
the loss of his tuk-tuk,

55:30.720 --> 55:32.520
we needed to get back on course.

55:34.160 --> 55:36.560
I think we're meant to be going
that way.

55:36.560 --> 55:38.720
How did I become your driver?

55:40.960 --> 55:43.640
Island number nine was the goal.

55:43.640 --> 55:45.480
And we had to reach it.

55:46.440 --> 55:48.640
What's that one there -
is that number five?

55:50.520 --> 55:54.120
- I think that's number four. - Four?!
- Yeah.

55:55.120 --> 55:57.560
It's going to take us a while
because I don't know

55:57.560 --> 55:59.840
if you've noticed,
we're not going very fast.

56:01.000 --> 56:05.240
We were now halfway, and with only
a few hours of daylight left,

56:05.240 --> 56:08.440
there was still a long,
long way to go.

56:08.440 --> 56:12.080
- You know that saying,
middle of nowhere? - Yeah. - This is it.

56:12.080 --> 56:15.160
We are literally in the middle
of nowhere.

56:15.160 --> 56:17.240
I cannot see another thing.

56:18.800 --> 56:22.640
Alone in the endless ocean,
the hours ticked by.

56:24.280 --> 56:26.800
# Yo-ho-yo-ho

56:26.800 --> 56:29.600
♪ A pirate's life for me. ♪

56:29.600 --> 56:31.680
Ha-haar! Ha-haar, me hearties!

56:34.320 --> 56:40.320
What would win in a fight,
an elephant or a great white?

56:40.320 --> 56:41.640
In a fight, where?

56:43.720 --> 56:45.840
In shallow water?

56:45.840 --> 56:47.840
King Kong versus Godzilla?

56:47.840 --> 56:49.480
King Kong's a monkey.

56:49.480 --> 56:51.600
Godzilla's a bloody dragon!

56:51.600 --> 56:53.200
Godzilla's not real!

56:53.200 --> 56:54.440
Top ten vegetables?

56:55.840 --> 56:58.560
Favourite vegetable,
number one is broccoli.

56:58.560 --> 57:01.920
My mother makes it in a little
garlic and olive oil, it's nice.

57:01.920 --> 57:04.200
Green beans, spinach.

57:05.760 --> 57:07.920
You know what's funny?

57:07.920 --> 57:10.120
I can't remember a time
we weren't on this thing.

57:15.240 --> 57:16.480
But still, we sailed on.

57:22.160 --> 57:25.200
I've done 40mph
on a track in this thing.

57:26.600 --> 57:28.360
I've been upside down on it.

57:28.360 --> 57:30.880
And I'm now sailing it to India.

57:34.480 --> 57:37.080
I was a sceptic at first.

57:37.080 --> 57:38.520
But I've got to say,

57:38.520 --> 57:41.560
the mighty little tuk-tuk
has definitely grown on me.

57:41.560 --> 57:42.920
I've softened to it.

57:45.360 --> 57:47.880
I was brought to Sri Lanka
to be shown

57:47.880 --> 57:50.040
the versatility of the tuk-tuk.

57:50.040 --> 57:52.840
You've brought me halfway
around the world to see a tuk-tuk?

57:52.840 --> 57:55.880
To be shown why this
quirky little three-wheeler is

57:55.880 --> 57:58.760
so much greater than
the sum of its parts.

57:58.760 --> 58:01.840
This is about brilliant simplicity.

58:01.840 --> 58:04.680
I thought it ridiculous to call it
a city car...

58:04.680 --> 58:05.800
It's a death trap!

58:05.800 --> 58:07.760
..a sports car...

58:07.760 --> 58:09.080
No, it isn't.

58:09.080 --> 58:12.120
..to call it a delivery vehicle...

58:12.120 --> 58:15.120
- It feels like it wants to go over.
- Where? - Everywhere.

58:15.120 --> 58:16.960
..to call it an off-roader...

58:16.960 --> 58:18.960
Harris, I'm going to kill you!

58:18.960 --> 58:23.760
..a jack-of-all-trades at best,
I thought, but a master of none...

58:25.720 --> 58:27.240
..but...

58:28.480 --> 58:29.840
..it had its ups...

58:29.840 --> 58:32.800
We got it! ..and its downs.

58:35.040 --> 58:39.040
There's no denying
the tuk-tuk is resilient.

58:39.040 --> 58:43.680
CHEERING
Yes!

58:43.680 --> 58:47.080
You know what,
however our voyage ended,

58:47.080 --> 58:52.000
this humble little workhorse
had more than proven its worth.

58:53.800 --> 58:55.200
And with the sun almost set...

58:56.360 --> 58:59.240
..finally land.

59:01.160 --> 59:02.240
- Here's nine! - Yes!

59:06.200 --> 59:09.080
You know what?
I think we're going to make it.

59:10.640 --> 59:15.080
Here we go. OK, we are
about to reach India...

59:16.320 --> 59:17.360
..in a tuk-tuk.

59:32.600 --> 59:35.000
- India! - India.

59:35.000 --> 59:36.760
LAUGHTER

59:36.760 --> 59:37.800
All right!

59:43.200 --> 59:45.560
Come on! We made it.

59:45.560 --> 59:47.840
And we're going to get arrested.

59:47.840 --> 59:48.960
We made it all the way.

59:50.120 --> 59:51.720
How are you? This is India, yes?

59:51.720 --> 59:53.200
- This is India. - This is India.

59:53.200 --> 59:54.840
We did it. High five.

59:54.840 --> 59:57.360
We made it. Are we under arrest?

59:57.360 --> 59:59.680
- No, no, you're not under arrest.
- Oh, good, that's great!

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:04.160
- All right, do you know what's next?
- What?

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:05.520
Let's find this Adam guy.

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:14.480
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:20.080
We made it! We made it!

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:23.080
Even an ocean can't beat a tuk-tuk.

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:25.000
But hang on a minute.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.880
How is that one here? Wasn't
this at the bottom of the ocean?

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:29.480
They're survivors, OK.

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:31.360
They sink, they rise again.

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:34.920
You see,
all you need is a can-do attitude,

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:39.600
and some help from the Sri Lankan
Navy and the Indian Coastguard.

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:41.400
- I mean, look, she's a beaut!
- Yup, yup.

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:42.520
You know, I was sceptical,

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:46.640
but I am sold on the brilliance
of the tuk-tuk.

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:50.280
I mean, it's not fast,
it's not elegant.

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:52.320
It's not...it's not a lot of things.

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:54.600
But most importantly,
it is not a quitter.

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:58.360
You're right, it is the most
versatile car on the planet,

01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:01.360
aside from my Ford pick-up truck.
All right.

01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:04.480
That's it.
No, I love it, I do. I love it, OK.

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:07.400
That's all we have time for tonight.
Thank you so much for watching.

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:09.000
We'll see you next week. Goodnight.
