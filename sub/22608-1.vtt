00:44.980 --> 00:48.019
Africa.

00:48.020 --> 00:50.860
The world's greatest wilderness.

01:00.220 --> 01:05.060
The only place on Earth to see
the full majesty of nature.

01:13.820 --> 01:17.460
There's so much more here than
we ever imagined.

01:18.900 --> 01:21.979
I'm standing where the equator

01:21.980 --> 01:26.219
cuts right across the middle
of the continent.

01:26.220 --> 01:28.458
To the north of me,
there's an immense desert

01:28.459 --> 01:31.020
the size of the United States
of America.

01:31.021 --> 01:35.179
To the west, a vast rainforest
the size of India.

01:35.180 --> 01:37.340
And behind me,
for thousands of miles,

01:37.341 --> 01:40.420
the most fertile
savannahs in the world.

01:49.340 --> 01:50.780
From the roof of Africa...

01:53.220 --> 01:54.980
..to the deepest jungle.

01:59.620 --> 02:04.660
Rarely seen places,
and untold stories.

02:05.860 --> 02:09.940
There's nowhere in the world where
wildlife puts on a greater show.

02:26.940 --> 02:29.179
This is the last place on Earth

02:29.180 --> 02:30.978
where you can come eye to eye

02:30.979 --> 02:34.020
with the greatest animals that
walk our planet.

02:42.580 --> 02:45.020
This is Africa.

03:01.420 --> 03:05.259
Our journey starts in the far
south west,

03:05.260 --> 03:08.460
in the oldest and strangest
corner of the continent.

03:16.620 --> 03:18.740
Here, the thirsty land is covered

03:18.741 --> 03:21.780
with thousands upon
thousands of circles.

03:28.180 --> 03:30.899
We still don't know their origins.

03:30.900 --> 03:33.979
Poisonous plants, foraging insects

03:33.980 --> 03:39.180
and even magnetism have all been
suggested, but each ruled out.

03:49.060 --> 03:53.099
The circles don't move,
and their shape never varies.

03:53.100 --> 03:58.220
They're unchanging, much like
this part of Africa itself.

04:02.500 --> 04:07.259
Ancient and arid,
it almost never rains on this land,

04:07.260 --> 04:10.220
yet there is water here,
hidden away.

04:18.899 --> 04:23.740
To survive here, life must use
every trick in the book.

04:37.780 --> 04:43.140
Winter. Dawn temperatures can fall
well below freezing.

04:47.140 --> 04:49.979
And that's a problem
for this drongo.

04:49.980 --> 04:53.380
It's too cold for his normal prey,
flying insects.

04:57.100 --> 05:02.180
But he has a plan. The drongo is
the Kalahari's greatest trickster.

05:07.220 --> 05:09.980
And these are his victims.

05:12.140 --> 05:15.740
A family of meerkats,
desert specialists.

05:20.820 --> 05:23.058
After warming up in the morning sun,

05:23.059 --> 05:25.700
the meerkats begin
their search for breakfast.

05:28.340 --> 05:30.660
The drongo can now begin his tricks.

05:32.500 --> 05:35.660
But he must first win
the confidence of his victims.

05:41.180 --> 05:43.460
He spots an eagle on the hunt,
and sounds a warning.

05:43.461 --> 05:46.059
(CHIRRUPING)

05:46.060 --> 05:49.660
One that sends the meerkats
gratefully scurrying to safety.

05:56.780 --> 05:58.300
Danger over.

06:01.420 --> 06:04.020
And now, he has their trust.

06:07.660 --> 06:08.980
He sounds another warning.

06:08.981 --> 06:10.460
(CHIRRUPING)

06:13.940 --> 06:16.620
But this time, it's a false alarm.

06:21.220 --> 06:22.780
Thank you very much!

06:27.540 --> 06:30.100
The meerkats fell for it.

06:38.060 --> 06:42.899
This all seems too easy.
He tries the same trick again.

06:42.900 --> 06:44.500
(CHIRRUPING)

06:46.140 --> 06:47.540
(BARKING)

06:53.060 --> 06:56.620
But the meerkats aren't stupid -
they'll only fall for it once.

07:05.660 --> 07:08.860
The juicy scorpion won't be for him.

07:13.260 --> 07:16.620
Then, suddenly,
the sound of a sentry's warning.

07:17.660 --> 07:21.620
No meerkat can ignore that.
Sentries never lie.

07:23.340 --> 07:25.020
But the sentry sees no danger.

07:29.220 --> 07:30.980
Guess who?

07:40.100 --> 07:42.619
Of course, it's the drongo.

07:42.620 --> 07:45.860
He's learnt to mimic the meerkats'
own warning call.

07:48.220 --> 07:51.020
And now, he can enjoy his prize.

07:53.820 --> 07:59.860
A gang of meerkats,
outsmarted by a bird.

08:03.980 --> 08:08.459
The drongo is only deceitful
in the hardest winter months.

08:08.460 --> 08:12.260
For the rest of the year,
he provides honest protection.

08:13.500 --> 08:19.620
So, in the long run, the meerkat
family profit as well as the drongo.

08:21.180 --> 08:22.980
(CHIRRUPING)

08:26.700 --> 08:28.339
It's a much harder life,

08:28.340 --> 08:31.900
if you haven't yet learned
the tricks of your trade.

08:45.020 --> 08:48.259
This young leopard
is just a year old,

08:48.260 --> 08:50.740
and at a critical point in his life.

09:14.020 --> 09:17.459
His mother has battled to
raise her two cubs,

09:17.460 --> 09:21.300
but finding enough food for them
is now beyond her.

09:25.620 --> 09:29.020
From today, he'll have to
fend for himself.

09:38.620 --> 09:42.220
Kalahari means
"land of great thirst".

09:46.940 --> 09:50.779
Prey is scarce.
Of all the leopards in Africa,

09:50.780 --> 09:53.540
these have to be the most
resourceful.

10:00.940 --> 10:03.019
A big warthog.

10:03.020 --> 10:05.819
Potential prey,

10:05.820 --> 10:07.620
but armed and dangerous.

10:10.540 --> 10:14.140
His mother tried to tackle one,
but it nearly killed her.

10:31.620 --> 10:34.220
He spots something more promising.

10:48.660 --> 10:52.260
A steenbok, that's more like it.

10:59.740 --> 11:03.979
He won't strike unless he can get
to within just four metres,

11:03.980 --> 11:06.380
and without making
the slightest sound.

11:10.940 --> 11:13.659
(ANXIOUS YAPPING)

11:13.660 --> 11:15.700
A jackal barks an alarm.

11:19.500 --> 11:23.340
But the steenbok still has no idea
it's being stalked.

11:29.420 --> 11:33.500
The nearer he gets,
the quieter he must be.

12:11.220 --> 12:12.700
He's blown it.

12:26.060 --> 12:30.500
A good opportunity like that
won't come around very often.

12:37.220 --> 12:41.219
Hungry and thirsty,
he heads back home,

12:41.220 --> 12:47.260
and spots a kill stashed in a tree,
almost certainly by his own mother.

12:48.540 --> 12:52.740
And, like any teenager, he thinks
nothing of raiding her larder.

13:04.580 --> 13:06.340
Booby trapped.

13:48.260 --> 13:50.540
It's not really his day, is it?

13:53.740 --> 13:58.299
Some young leopards grow up to be
brilliant opportunists.

13:58.300 --> 14:02.060
But even they find life hard
here in the Kalahari.

14:11.820 --> 14:15.260
These bizarre little birds
are baby ostriches.

14:18.100 --> 14:20.740
They're just a few days old.

14:24.220 --> 14:27.820
In time, they'll become superb
desert survivors.

14:30.100 --> 14:34.300
But in the Kalahari,
these early days are perilous.

14:35.660 --> 14:39.659
Like leopards and meerkats,
adult ostriches can extract

14:39.660 --> 14:43.099
all the moisture
they require from their food.

14:43.100 --> 14:44.539
The chicks, however,

14:44.540 --> 14:48.420
won't survive much more than
another day without water.

14:50.180 --> 14:51.938
But there's none in sight.

14:51.939 --> 14:55.180
How can their parents conjure up
water out here?

15:12.620 --> 15:15.020
The youngsters follow their parents,

15:15.021 --> 15:18.540
as they head out onto
a featureless wasteland.

15:23.300 --> 15:25.580
It seems like a suicidal journey.

15:38.580 --> 15:41.180
The Etosha salt pan.

15:42.620 --> 15:46.580
Here, water is more often
a mirage than reality.

15:51.340 --> 15:54.140
It's now well over 40 degrees
centigrade.

15:56.260 --> 16:00.460
Their father shades his chicks
from the midday sun.

16:08.820 --> 16:10.500
Another mirage?

16:14.380 --> 16:18.580
No. The ostrich family
is not alone out here.

16:26.540 --> 16:30.339
Surrounded by miles
of sun-baked mud,

16:30.340 --> 16:37.019
sweet, fresh water wells up
from deep below ground...

16:37.020 --> 16:38.740
like a miracle.

17:00.020 --> 17:03.460
Although the ostrich parents have
guided their chicks to water,

17:03.461 --> 17:06.300
there's still a problem traffic.

17:08.500 --> 17:10.020
Heavy traffic.

17:13.900 --> 17:18.460
These tiny, fragile birds could
easily be trampled under foot.

17:20.900 --> 17:24.140
The water is tantalisingly close.

17:31.900 --> 17:36.140
Where prey gathers,
predators are never far behind.

18:28.860 --> 18:33.340
The brawling lions have unwittingly
done the young ostriches a favour.

18:34.620 --> 18:36.460
The waterhole is now clear.

18:39.380 --> 18:42.580
Sometimes, you need
a bit of luck in life.

19:00.620 --> 19:03.259
Their first-ever drink...

19:03.260 --> 19:05.700
and just in time.

19:11.620 --> 19:13.220
Their father's done his job.

19:29.740 --> 19:35.580
A black rhinoceros, the Kalahari's
most cantankerous resident.

19:38.940 --> 19:41.019
They don't like company,

19:41.020 --> 19:44.500
and they certainly don't like
sharing a waterhole with lions.

19:46.580 --> 19:49.420
Fortunately
for everyone else, that is

19:49.421 --> 19:51.620
they only visit twice a week.

20:03.820 --> 20:07.900
The Kalahari is the black rhino's
last stronghold.

20:11.540 --> 20:13.978
And here, under the cover
of darkness,

20:13.979 --> 20:16.620
at one secret
and very special waterhole,

20:16.621 --> 20:20.299
rhino abandon their normally
solitary life,

20:20.300 --> 20:23.900
and come from miles around
to meet under the stars.

20:28.900 --> 20:32.219
Using the latest starlight camera,

20:32.220 --> 20:37.140
we can reveal for the first time
the rhino's true character.

20:42.060 --> 20:45.019
This young female seems nervous.

20:45.020 --> 20:47.460
She senses other rhinos close by.

20:49.740 --> 20:53.980
A mother appears from the shadows
with her calf.

21:03.940 --> 21:07.300
Tentatively, they greet one another.

21:10.860 --> 21:13.659
They may be ill-tempered by day,

21:13.660 --> 21:17.540
but now they become gentle
and affectionate.

21:25.340 --> 21:27.300
More and more arrive.

21:36.460 --> 21:39.859
We had no idea that rhinos
met to socialise

21:39.860 --> 21:41.900
and build friendships like this.

22:07.300 --> 22:10.540
The young female has an admirer.

22:16.020 --> 22:19.060
But she doesn't seem keen on him.

22:25.100 --> 22:28.619
She's excited about something.

22:28.620 --> 22:30.460
Or someone.

22:35.740 --> 22:38.980
Here comes a really big male.

22:44.020 --> 22:46.620
This time,
she's much more welcoming.

23:02.380 --> 23:06.020
Who would have thought that
rhino could be so flirtatious?

23:08.620 --> 23:11.538
The first male
tries to come between them.

23:11.539 --> 23:15.540
Somehow or other, he's got a pair
of antelope horns stuck on his nose.

23:21.580 --> 23:25.300
It looks as if she's been won over
by his eccentric style.

23:28.980 --> 23:31.620
He leads her off,
away from the party.

23:52.460 --> 23:54.819
He may have style

23:54.820 --> 23:58.020
but he's turning out to be
something of a disappointment.

24:06.980 --> 24:08.780
(GRUNTING)

24:13.100 --> 24:15.380
A girl can only put up with so much.

24:21.300 --> 24:25.620
The only way she can get rid of him
is to pretend she's asleep.

24:30.740 --> 24:35.379
To see so many rhino in one place
is a revelation.

24:35.380 --> 24:39.380
And that's the power water has
here the power to bring together

24:39.381 --> 24:43.060
the greatest gathering of rhinos
anywhere on Earth.

25:03.340 --> 25:05.460
Spitzkoppe.

25:07.100 --> 25:10.539
An ancient volcano,
that towers above a plateau

25:10.540 --> 25:12.820
that is two billion years old.

25:16.380 --> 25:18.659
This land has remained unchanged

25:18.660 --> 25:21.260
for longer than any other part
of Africa.

25:25.380 --> 25:29.819
Animals here have had a long time
to find inventive solutions

25:29.820 --> 25:32.220
to the challenge of finding water.

25:57.820 --> 26:03.339
Out on the open plains, life must
await the chance arrival of rain.

26:03.340 --> 26:05.140
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

26:06.500 --> 26:10.620
When it does fall,
it has an extraordinary effect.

26:14.420 --> 26:17.779
Each sporadic downpour
may only last minutes,

26:17.780 --> 26:22.020
but it can bring life,
and in spectacular numbers.

26:30.660 --> 26:34.179
Red-billed quelea.

26:34.180 --> 26:36.420
(SHRILL CHORUS)

26:38.620 --> 26:41.138
They're the most numerous
bird in the world.

26:41.139 --> 26:44.740
In all, more than a billion
live here in the Kalahari.

26:45.780 --> 26:47.258
No-one knows quite how,

26:47.259 --> 26:50.498
but they seem to have an
extraordinary ability to locate

26:50.499 --> 26:54.940
the fall of rain, and then instantly
exploit the bonanza that follows.

27:12.620 --> 27:16.899
These nomads now have just
five weeks to find food,

27:16.900 --> 27:19.940
build a nest and raise a brood.

27:30.300 --> 27:31.900
But they're not alone.

27:35.220 --> 27:39.100
The rains
have also created a plague.

27:50.580 --> 27:53.859
These are armoured ground crickets.

27:53.860 --> 27:58.740
Giant insects, with voracious
appetites... for meat.

28:06.580 --> 28:09.179
With the quelea parents
away feeding,

28:09.180 --> 28:10.940
their chicks are defenceless.

28:54.980 --> 28:56.340
The adults return.

29:06.340 --> 29:08.660
But the cricket fights back.

29:10.820 --> 29:14.860
Squirting its own foul-tasting
blood into their eyes.

29:41.300 --> 29:42.938
The cricket is still alive,

29:42.939 --> 29:46.780
but the stench of its blood
attracts the attention of others.

29:56.740 --> 29:58.620
Now, IT is the target.

30:00.820 --> 30:03.420
These crickets become cannibals.

30:18.900 --> 30:23.019
All too soon, the bonanza
brought by the rain is over,

30:23.020 --> 30:27.940
and the quelea head off in search
of the next rare downpour.

30:46.540 --> 30:52.019
The Kalahari is scarred by rivers
that have long since run dry,

30:52.020 --> 30:54.940
the water claimed
by the thirsty land.

31:07.420 --> 31:09.060
But it's not gone far.

31:13.180 --> 31:17.019
Deep below lies a secret,

31:17.020 --> 31:20.420
one that was discovered
only 25 years ago.

31:35.500 --> 31:39.939
Humid air rushing to the surface
gives this place its name,

31:39.940 --> 31:41.780
Dragon's Breath Cave.

31:51.180 --> 31:54.340
The shaft descends for 60 metres,
until it meets...

31:58.580 --> 32:00.140
..water.

32:02.580 --> 32:05.339
Here, there is a massive chamber,

32:05.340 --> 32:09.579
big enough to swallow three
jumbo jets, nose to tail,

32:09.580 --> 32:12.180
filled with cool, fresh water.

32:13.740 --> 32:16.300
The world's largest
underground lake.

32:27.060 --> 32:29.300
This is fossil water.

32:31.620 --> 32:34.940
It's been trapped here,
undisturbed, for thousands,

32:34.941 --> 32:36.900
if not millions, of years.

32:43.540 --> 32:45.820
We have no idea how deep
the lake is.

32:47.100 --> 32:49.378
Divers have been down to 100 metres,

32:49.379 --> 32:51.900
and still there's no sign
of the bottom.

32:57.820 --> 33:02.819
Remarkably, Dragon's Breath
is part of a vast cave system

33:02.820 --> 33:06.220
that extends beneath the Kalahari
for thousands of miles.

33:11.540 --> 33:15.940
Even here, in this lonely cave,
there is life.

33:25.140 --> 33:30.019
Golden catfish,
only found in this one cave.

33:30.020 --> 33:34.700
They're the rarest and most
isolated fish in the world.

33:38.140 --> 33:42.820
Life down here is as challenging
as it is in the desert above.

33:44.580 --> 33:46.019
There's no food,

33:46.020 --> 33:49.260
except the debris that occasionally
falls onto the surface.

33:54.140 --> 33:57.659
And these catfish are totally blind.

33:57.660 --> 34:01.580
The only world they know is
the one they sense through touch.

34:06.340 --> 34:10.059
A blind fish living
in perpetual darkness,

34:10.060 --> 34:14.699
deep beneath one of the most
arid regions of Africa.

34:22.699 --> 34:28.659
Such cruel irony. So much water
hidden away out of reach.

34:34.420 --> 34:38.538
Along the western edge of the
Kalahari, the land becomes so dry,

34:38.539 --> 34:42.020
it seems impossible that any
life could survive here.

34:59.380 --> 35:00.780
The Namib.

35:02.140 --> 35:06.900
A million square miles of sand
exquisitely sculpted by the wind.

35:10.060 --> 35:12.980
This is the oldest
desert in the world.

35:22.380 --> 35:26.340
Respite comes from fog rolling in
from the Atlantic ocean.

35:29.460 --> 35:32.460
It condenses into a few
precious drops.

35:35.380 --> 35:38.900
Just enough to sustain life.

35:45.820 --> 35:48.740
A pompilid wasp is
searching the dunes.

35:54.220 --> 35:58.860
She's not looking for a drink, but
for somewhere moist to lay her egg.

36:02.580 --> 36:05.980
How will she pull off
a trick like that?

36:12.340 --> 36:16.140
The entrance to a burrow.
That's worth investigating.

36:23.740 --> 36:26.939
She may be tiny,
but once she decides to dig,

36:26.940 --> 36:29.780
she can shift extraordinary
quantities of sand.

36:47.260 --> 36:50.100
She's unearthed this spider
for a grisly purpose.

36:55.700 --> 37:00.179
It's so dry, the only place
with enough moisture for her egg

37:00.180 --> 37:03.300
is within the body of
another living thing.

37:06.660 --> 37:09.580
First, she must paralyse her victim.

37:13.420 --> 37:16.380
But then, the spider plays
its trump card.

37:34.580 --> 37:39.659
The aptly-named golden wheel spider
can cartwheel fast enough

37:39.660 --> 37:41.380
to escape its gruesome fate.

37:53.420 --> 37:56.700
For the wasp, her near
impossible search goes on.

38:21.100 --> 38:25.220
If it's hard enough for a tiny wasp
to survive here in the Namib,

38:25.221 --> 38:28.220
how is it possible for a giant?

38:38.580 --> 38:40.340
A desert giraffe.

38:43.060 --> 38:45.938
It's difficult to imagine how
such a huge animal

38:45.939 --> 38:48.540
can live in a place with
so little water.

38:56.100 --> 38:59.620
This old male is at the very
limit of his endurance.

39:12.460 --> 39:14.779
The land may be bone dry,

39:14.780 --> 39:18.140
but there are signs that water
once flowed here.

39:24.700 --> 39:28.460
The Hoanib, one of Namibia's rivers.

39:31.460 --> 39:33.220
A river of sand.

39:46.980 --> 39:50.699
The trees that line these
sand rivers send roots down

39:50.700 --> 39:55.300
over 30 metres to tap water that
lies deep beneath the river bed.

39:58.820 --> 40:02.659
These trees are
the giraffe's salvation,

40:02.660 --> 40:06.780
even if he has to stretch to
his very tallest to get a mouthful.

40:13.020 --> 40:16.620
Even on tip-toe, he still needs
a half-metre-long tongue

40:16.621 --> 40:19.340
to reach the leaves
he so badly needs.

40:40.100 --> 40:44.299
He's ruled this stretch
of the Hoanib for over a decade,

40:44.300 --> 40:47.700
and this prime territory is
attracting females.

40:58.180 --> 41:00.780
He waits confidently for her.

41:11.340 --> 41:13.859
But they've got company.

41:13.860 --> 41:15.460
A young male.

41:57.620 --> 42:00.660
The old bull won't tolerate a rival.

42:07.300 --> 42:10.220
Pushing and shoving,
they size each other up.

42:16.060 --> 42:19.740
The young rival seems to think
he has a chance and attacks.

42:32.980 --> 42:36.500
The first few blows usually
settle things in such battles,

42:36.501 --> 42:39.460
but here, the stakes are high.

42:47.100 --> 42:49.620
To lose means exile in the desert.

42:53.300 --> 42:55.300
Neither will back down.

43:00.860 --> 43:04.659
As the fight intensifies,
they change tactics.

43:04.660 --> 43:06.780
The young male aims for the rump.

43:08.540 --> 43:13.180
The old bull
targets his rival's legs.

44:00.900 --> 44:02.740
The old bull is down.

44:11.900 --> 44:13.700
Is this the end of his reign?

44:19.420 --> 44:22.420
He knows a knockout blow is coming.

44:35.900 --> 44:37.460
But the old bull ducks...

44:42.180 --> 44:46.820
..and strikes a blow
to his rival's underbelly.

45:22.740 --> 45:24.460
Out for the count.

45:36.180 --> 45:38.820
The old bull is victorious.

45:41.820 --> 45:43.900
But only just.

45:52.820 --> 45:56.100
The sand river remains his to rule.

46:18.860 --> 46:22.460
It's a river that is about
to be transformed.

46:27.420 --> 46:32.100
Under clear blue skies,
water floods down the Hoanib.

46:37.740 --> 46:41.980
The welcome consequence of rain
that fell hundreds of miles away.

46:56.260 --> 46:59.460
The water may only flow
for a matter of hours.

47:02.540 --> 47:05.979
But this miraculous flood
is enough to provide

47:05.980 --> 47:10.780
a lifeline for the trees and the
giraffes of the Hoanib River.

47:17.540 --> 47:20.620
It's what makes this place
worth fighting for.

47:38.300 --> 47:43.139
Here, fossil lakes,
secret waterholes, desert fog

47:43.140 --> 47:47.299
and ephemeral rivers like this
provide just enough water

47:47.300 --> 47:51.700
for life to get by,
no matter how tough it gets.

47:55.500 --> 47:59.739
It's hard to find more inventive
solutions to staying alive

47:59.740 --> 48:03.820
than in this,
the most ancient corner of Africa.

48:28.740 --> 48:32.258
For four years, the Africa team
searched the continent

48:32.259 --> 48:34.340
for new and surprising stories.

48:34.341 --> 48:37.579
Not only of strange
and unfamiliar creatures,

48:37.580 --> 48:39.780
but also of some we think we know.

48:42.500 --> 48:46.218
Veteran wildlife cameraman
Martyn Colbeck took on the challenge

48:46.219 --> 48:49.740
of shedding new light on the life
of Namibia's desert giraffe.

48:53.740 --> 48:57.698
I jumped at the opportunity
of working with an animal that

48:57.699 --> 48:59.780
I hadn't really spent much
time with.

48:59.781 --> 49:04.019
Straight away, they proved
to be quite an eye-opener.

49:04.020 --> 49:06.619
They're very bizarre
looking animals.

49:06.620 --> 49:09.620
We just kept looking at them
from different angles

49:09.621 --> 49:12.100
and they looked even weirder.

49:13.580 --> 49:17.178
The combination of the sort of
weird close ups, the beautiful

49:17.179 --> 49:18.580
landscape that they're in.

49:18.581 --> 49:20.659
They're amusing...

49:20.660 --> 49:23.700
I got really attached
to them, actually.

49:28.380 --> 49:31.580
Overlying all this,
we were always waiting for a fight.

49:32.700 --> 49:35.460
But to see a full-blooded fight
is very rare.

49:36.700 --> 49:39.338
So, the only way that
we were going to see it

49:39.339 --> 49:43.180
is if we stuck at it, day after day,
every day for 30 days.

49:45.020 --> 49:48.340
We were lucky enough that we
found a male guarding a female.

49:53.700 --> 49:56.620
And out of nowhere,
this male came round the corner.

50:02.500 --> 50:06.220
And almost immediately
faced up to our male.

50:08.780 --> 50:11.660
Absolutely no warning that this
was going to happen,

50:11.661 --> 50:14.699
so it was complete
pandemonium in the car.

50:14.700 --> 50:19.179
But luckily I got the camera up
and running in time to actually

50:19.180 --> 50:23.020
capture this fight, and it all came
down to one minute in real time.

50:28.300 --> 50:31.538
When I filmed it,
you don't see it in slow motion.

50:31.539 --> 50:34.140
And you just have to
go with the flow.

50:35.580 --> 50:37.858
You're not experiencing the fight,

50:37.859 --> 50:40.698
you're just basically framing it
and capturing it.

50:40.699 --> 50:43.538
So it was only afterwards, when
we looked at it in slow motion,

50:43.539 --> 50:46.740
that you could really understand
how ferocious it was.

50:52.260 --> 50:55.259
You can see the impact on the skin.

50:55.260 --> 50:57.740
You can see the ripples going
through the flesh.

51:01.100 --> 51:04.738
But it was the final blows
that delivered the real surprise.

51:04.739 --> 51:07.500
It was like one of those
chimneys falling down.

51:11.860 --> 51:14.780
At the last moment,
the head just went clunk!

51:30.220 --> 51:32.580
And we thought it was dead.

51:34.820 --> 51:36.940
We thought this thing was dead.

51:39.100 --> 51:41.820
And it lay there for,
it must have been three minutes.

51:43.700 --> 51:47.178
Eventually, this thing suddenly
got up, the one that was

51:47.179 --> 51:51.578
lying down, and the two of them were
then standing, and then the one that

51:51.579 --> 51:55.820
had been knocked over completely
then just said, "I've had enough."

51:55.821 --> 51:58.660
"OK, OK, you won and I'm off".

52:04.020 --> 52:06.260
I, I think it's very unlikely
I'm going to see

52:06.261 --> 52:07.979
anything like that again.

52:07.980 --> 52:10.860
I think that's a
once-in-a-life-timer. I really do.

52:13.620 --> 52:17.260
It won't be easy to look at
giraffes in the same way again.

52:22.460 --> 52:24.260
On the other side of the desert,

52:24.261 --> 52:26.939
another of Africa's
great animal icons

52:26.940 --> 52:29.979
was attracting
the attention of the team

52:29.980 --> 52:32.540
as they staked out
a secret waterhole.

52:37.300 --> 52:40.339
They hoped to reveal
a very different side

52:40.340 --> 52:43.260
to the personality of
the black rhinoceros.

52:46.620 --> 52:51.180
The team have heard that at night
rhinos behave a little strangely.

53:04.500 --> 53:08.140
A specially-built starlight camera
would allow the team

53:08.141 --> 53:09.740
to pierce the darkness.

53:14.860 --> 53:18.979
It's amazing. That's filming
something we can't even see.

53:18.980 --> 53:21.538
Yeah, and if you look
out there now...

53:21.539 --> 53:22.780
Yeah, it's just black, isn't it?

53:22.781 --> 53:25.979
But through this,
it looks as sharp as day.

53:25.980 --> 53:29.299
Rhinos are notoriously anti-social,

53:29.300 --> 53:34.659
yet here they come to revel
in each other's company.

53:34.660 --> 53:36.420
This is amazing.

53:38.780 --> 53:41.819
This is such intimate behaviour,

53:41.820 --> 53:45.899
which you can only see
filming them at night like this.

53:45.900 --> 53:47.180
It's incredible.

53:54.140 --> 53:59.420
But it wasn't just cameras that
would show a new side to rhinos.

54:00.780 --> 54:05.339
By concealing tiny radio
microphones around the waterhole,

54:05.340 --> 54:10.099
the crew hoped to eavesdrop
on the night's activity.

54:10.100 --> 54:13.180
(RHINOS GRUNT)

54:22.860 --> 54:26.340
And what they heard was astonishing.

54:27.340 --> 54:29.180
(RHINO GRUMBLES)

54:30.260 --> 54:32.260
They're really talkative.

54:34.060 --> 54:36.300
They really are having a good chat.

54:38.940 --> 54:43.420
These guys are far more
communicative than elephants, even.

54:45.260 --> 54:49.299
They're just going on and on,
chatting away.

54:49.300 --> 54:51.500
(SQUEALS AND GRUNTS)

54:52.980 --> 54:55.418
It's a beautiful,
crystal clear night,

54:55.419 --> 54:57.460
so we've got beautiful starry shots.

54:57.461 --> 55:02.100
Loads of amazing noise.
Puffing and huffing.

55:06.180 --> 55:09.339
So it's about two in the morning.

55:09.340 --> 55:11.458
There's only one rhino left up there.

55:11.459 --> 55:13.378
The rest of the them
have gone to bed,

55:13.379 --> 55:16.100
but he's decided to lie down
right on top of the radio mic.

55:17.860 --> 55:20.580
(RHINO GRUNTS AND SNORTS)

55:29.500 --> 55:31.940
The crew prepared for one more night

55:31.941 --> 55:34.780
at the waterhole
under the full moon.

55:41.140 --> 55:44.700
It seems that they're
not really here for the water,

55:44.701 --> 55:47.219
but more to socialise.

55:47.220 --> 55:49.620
A bit like going out
for the evening.

55:54.700 --> 55:59.179
He's got some kudu horns on his
face, draped over his nose!

55:59.180 --> 56:01.379
(LAUGHTER)

56:01.380 --> 56:02.820
Is it all on camera, too?

56:06.020 --> 56:10.219
These images have a particular
poignancy in a world where

56:10.220 --> 56:14.859
rhino horn is worth more
than its weight in gold.

56:14.860 --> 56:17.820
Poaching is going through
a really bad time right now

56:17.821 --> 56:19.659
in Southern Africa.

56:19.660 --> 56:21.379
If you averaged it out,

56:21.380 --> 56:24.980
a rhino has been killed every day
for the last year.

56:27.580 --> 56:30.259
That's really serious poaching.

56:30.260 --> 56:36.579
It's a huge concern that what we saw
and filmed just won't happen again.

56:36.580 --> 56:38.660
Ever!

56:40.420 --> 56:43.900
It's only now that technology
has revealed a new side

56:43.901 --> 56:46.020
to the rhino's personality.

56:52.980 --> 56:57.499
The black rhinoceros is
a symbol of the African bush.

56:57.500 --> 57:01.300
But it seems that this creature
has been long misunderstood.

57:06.020 --> 57:09.259
For the Africa team,
revealing giraffes

57:09.260 --> 57:12.380
and rhinos in this new light
was just the beginning.

57:14.340 --> 57:17.140
Africa may be a continent
we think we know,

57:17.141 --> 57:20.180
but it's still full of surprises.
