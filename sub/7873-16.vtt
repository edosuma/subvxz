[ Weeping ]
I just thoughtyou'd wanna know.

11:49.208 --> 11:52.974
Of course.
Thoseyellow pieces!

11:53.079 --> 11:55.343
- Linda, wait!
- Forget her.

11:55.448 --> 11:59.544
Nowyou need an outfit, honey. 'Cause we're
going clubbing with our boy toys tonight.

11:59.652 --> 12:02.280
Soyou had better bring
yourval-la-la-la-la-la-lay.

12:02.388 --> 12:05.619
Myvalet.
Uh, right.

12:05.725 --> 12:08.956
- ##[Oriental Flourish ]
- I farted.

12:10.596 --> 12:14.430
Not a Frito, not a Newton.
Neither Fiddle nor Faddle.

12:14.533 --> 12:19.163
What's this? Lady Barkingston's
Bacon-Flavored Dog Scones?

12:19.271 --> 12:22.297
- [ Treats Rustling ]
- [ Crunching ]

12:23.342 --> 12:26.106
- [ Growling ]
- Oh, God!

12:26.212 --> 12:28.976
The gypsywas right.
This is how it ends.

12:29.081 --> 12:31.413
[ Groans ]

12:31.517 --> 12:34.384
Oh, now that I smell
like bacon, you like me, huh?

12:34.487 --> 12:37.945
Wait. I can use this
to screw with Stan.

12:38.057 --> 12:41.993
- [ Panting ]
- Yes, I can. Yes, I can. Little bastard.

12:44.630 --> 12:49.033
Okay, calm down.
It's not cheating. It's just acting.

12:49.135 --> 12:52.832
Acting's not that hard.
RenÃ©e Zellwegerjust makes it look hard.

12:52.938 --> 12:56.965
- Francine, haveyou seen
my darling little num-num-num?
- No, I haven't.

12:57.076 --> 12:59.476
- Bye. I'm going out.
- What's this?

12:59.578 --> 13:05.141
"My darling, Francine. I can't stop thinking
about our hot romantic weekend."

13:05.251 --> 13:07.515
[ Gasps ]
You're cheating on me!

13:07.620 --> 13:09.986
[ Gasps ]
Stan, I can explain.

13:10.089 --> 13:13.024
Fussy, how could you?
And with this!

13:13.125 --> 13:14.558
Ooh.

13:14.660 --> 13:18.596
Look at me. I've given myself
a whore's bath with your dog.

13:18.697 --> 13:22.155
Come near him again,
I swear to God, I'll kill you.

13:27.673 --> 13:30.369
- I want out ofthe Ladybugs.
- [ Ladybugs ] What?

13:30.476 --> 13:33.639
- [ BoyToys ] What?
- I'm sorry, girls.

13:33.746 --> 13:36.306
But I was never
even having an affair.

13:36.415 --> 13:39.248
But don't worry. I'll keepyour secrets.
[ Grunts ]

13:39.351 --> 13:42.718
You have dirt on us.
We need dirt on you.

13:42.822 --> 13:46.986
You have 24 hours to bed another man,
or there will be serious consequences.

13:47.092 --> 13:50.289
We wouldn't wantyou to end up
like poor Anne Fleming.

13:55.401 --> 13:57.733
Anne Flemming.
Herewe go.

- [Whirring]
- [ Screams ]

14:06.278 --> 14:08.712
Doyou mind?
I'm doing important research!

14:08.814 --> 14:10.714
Some people.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.651
Hmm.

14:16.755 --> 14:20.623
- You're being generous, Marvin.
- [Mouse Click ]

14:25.764 --> 14:28.460
Okay.
I'm safe in this house.

14:28.567 --> 14:30.592
The Ladybugs can't
get to me in here.

14:32.104 --> 14:35.335
That's funny.
I've never burned a shirt before.

14:39.945 --> 14:41.845
Oh, my God!

14:44.450 --> 14:46.645
[ Gasps ]
They replaced my cumin with coriander!

14:49.288 --> 14:52.121
- [Phone Ringing]
- Leave me alone!

14:52.224 --> 14:55.990
As you can see, we can get to you,
your family and your seasonings.

14:56.095 --> 14:59.622
Think about that ifyou're considering
not cheating on Stan.

14:59.732 --> 15:02.394
Oh, and, Francine,
I'd skip vacuuming today.

15:02.501 --> 15:04.401
##[Whistling]

15:05.771 --> 15:08.035
- Roger, no!

15:08.140 --> 15:10.506
- [ Screams ]
- Roger!

15:10.609 --> 15:14.340
- [Bell Dings ]
- [ Shrieks ] My roast!

15:14.446 --> 15:16.539
Stan, help me.

15:16.649 --> 15:19.641
I've been faking an affair
to impress the Ladybugs.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.516
They found out I was lying,
and now they're trying to kill me.

15:22.621 --> 15:25.317
A cult of murderous housewives.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.688
Before 9/1 1,
I wouldn't have believed it.

15:27.793 --> 15:29.886
Or at least I'd askyou
some follow-up questions.

15:29.995 --> 15:32.793
But that's just not
the world we live in anymore.

15:32.898 --> 15:35.196
I'm so sorry I pretended
to cheat on you.

15:35.301 --> 15:37.792
I don't know what to do!
[ Sobbing ]

15:37.903 --> 15:39.803
Don't worry. I'll protectyou.

15:39.905 --> 15:42.738
You and the kids are the most
precious thing in the world to me and-

15:42.841 --> 15:44.866
- [Barking]
- [Roger] Oh, Fussy, what's this?

15:44.977 --> 15:47.445
A gift certificate to the day spa?

15:47.546 --> 15:50.947
What's the occasion?
"Just because"?

15:51.050 --> 15:53.746
Oh, you must love me
more than anyone.

15:56.755 --> 16:00.191
- [Thudding]
- Stan! Oh, fine!

16:00.292 --> 16:03.728
Ifyou love that dog so much,
why don't you marry-

16:03.829 --> 16:05.194
[ Gasps ]

16:09.401 --> 16:12.199
- Please, I need help!
- Okay, calm down.

16:12.304 --> 16:16.934
- Have a seat, Francine.
- [ Sighs ] Thankyou so much. I-

16:17.042 --> 16:19.101
How did you know my name?

16:27.319 --> 16:30.846
Mister Editor, I have a story
the public needs to know!

16:30.956 --> 16:33.424
Talk to my assistant.

16:42.301 --> 16:45.464
Listen up! My doggie
is licking my roommate more than me.

16:45.571 --> 16:49.439
Dogs have a pack mentality. You need
to show him you're the alpha male.

16:49.541 --> 16:51.099
Hmm.

16:52.511 --> 16:54.945
- Save it for showtime, kid.

17:01.420 --> 17:03.945
You see that, Fussy?
I'm the alpha male!

17:05.156 --> 17:07.682
Ah! Aargh! Oww!

17:50.969 --> 17:52.869
I wonderwhere
she found that top.

Oh, right.
You guys are still locked in the closet.

18:44.857 --> 18:47.257
- Well, I guess you're free to go.
- No, boss.

18:47.359 --> 18:49.350
I can't make it on the outside.

18:49.461 --> 18:51.895
I'm an institutional man now.

18:51.997 --> 18:56.195
You treated us like animals,
and that's what we became!

18:59.671 --> 19:02.936
Last chance, Francine.
You can still join us.

19:03.041 --> 19:05.532
Not ifit means cheating on Stan.

19:05.644 --> 19:09.045
Our life may not be perfect, but he's
always there for me when I really need him.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.275
- Francine!
- Stan.

19:11.383 --> 19:13.749
My precious little man
ran away, Francine.

- Has he been past here?
- No, Stan.

19:17.222 --> 19:19.122
Okay, let's just do this.

[ Gasps ]
My God!

19:25.430 --> 19:29.332
I've been so blind.
You can never be loyal to just one man.

19:30.636 --> 19:32.627
He won't loveyou, you know.

19:32.738 --> 19:36.265
He's incapable oflove!

- No wonder she wouldn't cheat
on her husband with another man.

20:01.233 --> 20:04.999
You know, sweeties, this is

- Okay, Francine. We'll letyou live.

20:08.173 --> 20:11.108
But ifyou ever breathe
so much as a word...

20:11.210 --> 20:13.201
about the Ladybugs
and what we stand for...

- Duh.

20:20.686 --> 20:23.177
It's Wednesday,
our grocery shopping day?

20:23.288 --> 20:25.188
Isn't that crazy?

20:25.290 --> 20:27.690
I thought
my boring routine was killing me.

20:27.793 --> 20:29.852
But it ended up saving my life.

20:29.962 --> 20:33.090
And that fake lesbian kiss-
What a great idea!

20:33.198 --> 20:35.792
Fake?
Oh, yeah.

20:35.901 --> 20:39.928
- Of course. Fake.
- Oh, hi, Stan.

20:40.038 --> 20:42.336
Oh.
That's your husband.

20:42.441 --> 20:44.500
I'd better get home
to my husband...

20:44.610 --> 20:48.569
because I love him,
and I'm so sexually attracted to him.

20:48.680 --> 20:51.114
[ Nervous Laugh ]
Oh, yeah. He's got the good stuff.

20:51.216 --> 20:53.684
Oh, yeah.
[ Chuckling ]

20:53.785 --> 20:56.982
- Did you find your dog, honey?
- Fussy is gone.

20:57.089 --> 21:00.320
Let's just leave it at that. Wasn't
someone trying to kill you or something?

21:00.425 --> 21:02.791
Not anymore.
Let's just leave it at that.

21:02.894 --> 21:05.124
Come on.
Walk me home.
