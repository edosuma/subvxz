[knocks on door]

22:03.713 --> 22:05.672
Chicago PD.
I called earlier.

22:05.846 --> 22:07.413
Come on in.

22:23.124 --> 22:24.778
Oh, my God.

22:24.952 --> 22:26.388
What are you doing here?

22:26.562 --> 22:28.608
What is Josh doing here?

22:28.738 --> 22:31.132
Josh is here? Did he see you?Of course not.
I'm not an idiot.

22:31.306 --> 22:34.004
What-- What is going on?

22:35.919 --> 22:37.181
[lock clicks]

22:37.356 --> 22:39.401
Just shut up, Lesley!Felix!

22:39.575 --> 22:41.882
Felix, open up!

22:42.056 --> 22:43.797
I know you're in there.[banging on door]

22:43.971 --> 22:45.581
Felix!

22:51.195 --> 22:52.458
Sir, this is a library.

22:52.632 --> 22:54.285
I'm giving you one last chance!

22:54.460 --> 22:55.983
What is happening?
Why is Josh out there?

22:56.113 --> 22:57.550
I have no idea.
He's unhinged.

22:57.680 --> 22:59.247
JOSH:
Felix, open up!

22:59.421 --> 23:01.292
Ow! Ow, ow.

23:01.467 --> 23:02.381
Ow! Ow! Ow!Stop it.[banging on door]

23:02.555 --> 23:04.252
JOSH:
Felix!

23:04.426 --> 23:05.601
Ow!Tell me what's going on.

23:05.775 --> 23:06.820
All right.

23:06.994 --> 23:08.082
This book is full of drugs.

23:08.256 --> 23:09.431
JOSH:
Open the damn door!

23:09.605 --> 23:11.215
[banging on door]Felix!

23:11.346 --> 23:13.304
They belong to a dealer
Murphy met in prison.

23:13.479 --> 23:14.567
She accidentally took 'em,
and I guess he's

23:14.697 --> 23:16.220
onto her or something.

23:16.351 --> 23:18.919
Sir, please, if I could
just ask you to calm down.

23:19.093 --> 23:20.921
Open it.
Open it!

23:21.095 --> 23:22.836
All right, all right, sir.

23:23.010 --> 23:24.794
I will do just that.
Just give me one moment.

23:24.925 --> 23:26.056
Find the key here.

23:26.230 --> 23:27.667
Are you out of your mind?

23:27.841 --> 23:30.626
Are you stupid?
Are you stupid?!I know.

23:30.800 --> 23:32.236
I know.

23:32.367 --> 23:34.108
JOSH:
This is your last chance!

23:34.282 --> 23:36.240
He's gonna bash the door down.JOSH: Felix,
there's nowhere to run!

23:36.371 --> 23:37.807
Okay, let me think,
let me think.You're not getting out of here!

23:37.981 --> 23:39.418
Hold on.

23:39.592 --> 23:41.811
Geez, Felix...

Oh, my God.

[banging on door]JOSH: Felix!

23:47.382 --> 23:49.123
What's the plan here, Felix?

23:49.297 --> 23:51.038
I was gonna swallow them.JOSH: What are you hiding?

23:51.168 --> 23:51.952
Too many keys.

23:52.126 --> 23:53.519
Felix!All right.

23:53.693 --> 23:56.652
JOSH:
Felix, I'm not going anywhere.

23:56.826 --> 23:58.349
[banging on door][mutters]

23:58.524 --> 23:59.873
Open the door!All right, all right.

24:00.047 --> 24:01.570
I got it right here, sir.

24:02.615 --> 24:03.790
Okay, here we go.

24:05.226 --> 24:06.445
Don't move!

24:19.327 --> 24:21.024
That was evidence.

24:21.198 --> 24:23.549
Evidence of what?

24:23.723 --> 24:26.726
LESLEY:
Hey! No! Josh, stop it!

24:26.900 --> 24:28.118
You need to go.BRENDAN:
Sir, please. Leave.

24:28.292 --> 24:29.859
Felix. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

24:29.990 --> 24:31.426
Are you okay?

24:31.557 --> 24:33.472
Are you okay?
Look at me.

24:33.646 --> 24:35.517
What? Yeah.Are you okay?

24:35.691 --> 24:37.737
[doorbell rings]

24:40.653 --> 24:42.959
GENE: I love how this kid's
not even answering his door.

24:43.090 --> 24:46.354
Well, we are cops, and he's
probably dealing drugs, so...

24:47.834 --> 24:49.966
[gunshot]

24:50.140 --> 24:52.882
Whoa. Hey, hey, hey.
Shots fired. Shots fired!

25:01.369 --> 25:02.936
All right.

25:08.202 --> 25:11.031
GENE: We need backup
and an ambulance, now!

25:19.822 --> 25:21.345
Back door is open.

25:21.476 --> 25:22.521
I didn't see anyone.
They got away.

25:22.695 --> 25:24.914
Oh, my God.

25:27.482 --> 25:28.918
No pulse.

25:29.092 --> 25:31.399
Oh, my God.

25:31.573 --> 25:34.489
So, clearly, he was dealing,

25:34.663 --> 25:35.969
and pissed the wrong person off.

25:36.143 --> 25:37.318
Yeah.

25:37.492 --> 25:39.407
What's in his mouth?

25:42.497 --> 25:44.238
It's a hundred bucks,
remember?

25:44.412 --> 25:46.501
That's what those girls
tipped him.Okay.

25:46.632 --> 25:49.809
So Task Champ gets an order.

25:49.983 --> 25:52.638
They send their "handyman"
to deliver the drugs.

25:52.812 --> 25:54.378
Client pays the company
under the guise

25:54.509 --> 25:55.510
of home repairs or whatever.

25:55.641 --> 25:58.426
And this kid isn't happy
with his cut.

25:58.600 --> 25:59.819
His clients
sent him money directly,

25:59.993 --> 26:01.081
and it bit him
in the ass.

26:01.255 --> 26:03.257
Yeah, you think?

26:03.431 --> 26:07.653
Okay, I'll get a warrant to
search the Task Champ office.

26:10.612 --> 26:12.962
[quietly]:
Text Felix.

26:13.093 --> 26:14.877
What's taking so long,
question mark.

26:15.051 --> 26:16.749
Let me know when you're okay.
Send.

26:16.879 --> 26:18.925
[door slides open]

26:20.753 --> 26:23.625
Okay, let's see if
he'll eat now.

26:26.410 --> 26:28.369
[sighs]

26:32.199 --> 26:35.028
I'm sorry I didn't, uh...

26:35.202 --> 26:36.986
It's okay.

26:39.249 --> 26:41.817
You have no reason to believe
a word I say.

26:43.253 --> 26:44.777
Yeah.[Murphy exhales sharply]

26:49.172 --> 26:51.784

26:51.914 --> 26:53.829
[crying softly]

26:54.003 --> 26:56.179
Hey.

26:58.704 --> 27:00.836
What's wrong?

27:03.360 --> 27:05.188
Just overwhelmed,I guess.

27:14.241 --> 27:16.199
[chuckles]

27:16.373 --> 27:17.679
Such a bitch.

27:17.853 --> 27:19.159
[laughs]
Shut up.

27:19.333 --> 27:20.551
You can't even touch me?

27:20.726 --> 27:22.641
No, I can touch you.Okay. Sure.

27:22.815 --> 27:24.251

27:25.513 --> 27:27.863
There. You happy?

[Lesley scoffs]

27:35.479 --> 27:37.177
You could have
a concussion, Felix.

27:37.351 --> 27:39.222
I'm taking you to the ER.No!

27:39.396 --> 27:41.834
Just bring me to a pharmacy
so I can put some pills in this.

27:42.008 --> 27:44.401
Yeah, pretty sure drug dealers
can tell opiates from aspirin.

27:44.575 --> 27:46.316
Well, I'm obviously just
trying to buy time

27:46.490 --> 27:47.883
so they don't kill Murphy.

27:49.711 --> 27:52.061
Does it ever occur to you
that being Murphy's friend

27:52.192 --> 27:54.716
isn't the healthiest choice
for you?

the heart-- [groans]

28:34.190 --> 28:36.671

28:36.845 --> 28:38.325

okay?

28:42.024 --> 28:43.809
Get him inside.Wait!

28:43.983 --> 28:45.332
He already called me.KIM: Great.

28:45.462 --> 28:46.681
I'll remove him
from your schedule.

28:46.855 --> 28:47.551
No, no, no, please.
No, please.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.684
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, okay.

28:49.815 --> 28:51.425
No, I can, I can explain!

28:51.599 --> 28:53.601
KIM:
Also, just as a reminder...

28:53.775 --> 28:57.126
No! Stop!
Whoa, whoa, stop! Felix!

28:57.300 --> 28:59.563
No, Felix. Felix!

29:05.395 --> 29:06.832
It's an Illinois license plate.
It said NFC, I think.

29:07.006 --> 29:08.442
It was a black SUV.

29:08.616 --> 29:10.009
They have my brother
and they have a gun.

29:10.183 --> 29:11.575
Please, please hurry.

29:11.706 --> 29:13.926
They're heading south on Green.

29:18.408 --> 29:21.629
[phone vibrating]

29:24.588 --> 29:25.633
Hey, babe, what's up?

29:25.807 --> 29:27.069
Put Murphy on the phone.

29:27.243 --> 29:28.331
What? Why? Is everything okay?

29:28.505 --> 29:29.942
Put Murphy on the phone!

29:30.943 --> 29:32.161
It's Lesley.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.471
Hello?

29:37.645 --> 29:39.255
The pills in that book
are gone; we flushed them.

29:39.429 --> 29:40.909
And men with guns
just took Felix.

29:41.083 --> 29:42.041
Do you have any idea
where they're taking him?

29:42.215 --> 29:43.477
Why did you flush the pills?

29:43.651 --> 29:45.305
Because Josh was pounding
on the door!

29:45.479 --> 29:47.176
Now, do you know where
they're taking my brother?

29:47.307 --> 29:48.569
[gasps]

29:48.743 --> 29:50.353
I don't know.

29:50.527 --> 29:51.833
I don't know. Here.

29:52.007 --> 29:53.530
Probably to see
if I have the drugs,

29:53.704 --> 29:55.663
which I don't now,
thanks to you.[scoffs]

29:55.837 --> 29:57.447
Who is this person
you got the pills from?

29:57.621 --> 29:58.535
The one in prison.

29:58.666 --> 30:01.103
Uh, her name's Paula.

30:01.277 --> 30:02.626
Last name?

30:02.801 --> 30:04.063
Romano.

30:04.237 --> 30:05.673
What are you doing?I'm gonna see

30:05.847 --> 30:06.413
if there's anything
I can do on my end.

30:06.587 --> 30:07.675
Oh, my God.

30:07.849 --> 30:09.285
The cabin's about
an hour away,

30:09.459 --> 30:10.591
so we have a little time.

30:10.765 --> 30:13.333
Oh...

30:13.507 --> 30:16.031
[line ringing]KIM: Lesley Bell's office.

30:16.205 --> 30:17.903
Kim, I need you to call Peter
in the D.A.'s office

30:18.077 --> 30:19.905
and have him send over
everything he can

30:20.079 --> 30:22.429
on Paula Romano, inmate at
the Illinois State Prison.

30:22.559 --> 30:24.953
Say it's an emergency.Got it.

30:27.695 --> 30:29.523
Really, Murphy?
Come on.

30:29.697 --> 30:30.698
I can't believe you
right now.I honestly didn't know

30:30.872 --> 30:32.569
the drugs were in there.

30:32.743 --> 30:34.223
Can you say something?What do you want me to say?

30:34.354 --> 30:35.703
I don't know.
I-I don't know.

30:35.877 --> 30:37.357
Look, we got--
Murphy, we gotta go now!

30:37.487 --> 30:38.575
I can't. I can't!

30:38.706 --> 30:40.360
Murph, nobody cares about

30:40.534 --> 30:42.014
your stupid ankle bracelet
right now.

30:42.188 --> 30:44.146
If they show up here
and I'm-I'm gone,

30:44.320 --> 30:45.669
what do you think they're
gonna do to Felix?

30:45.800 --> 30:47.758
So that's it?!
We're just sitting ducks?

30:47.933 --> 30:50.631
This is insane, Murphy.You go.

30:50.805 --> 30:52.415
What?

30:52.589 --> 30:54.722
Go.

30:54.896 --> 30:56.376
Go. This has nothing
to do with you.

30:56.506 --> 30:58.769
Seriously.

30:58.944 --> 31:00.510
No, I'm... I'm not leaving you.

31:00.684 --> 31:02.817
You already did, Max.

31:06.299 --> 31:09.389
We both know what,
what it, what...

31:09.519 --> 31:12.348
What I am. I'm...

31:12.479 --> 31:16.700
I've been home five minutes,
and look at where we are.

31:19.573 --> 31:21.749
Lesley's good for you.

31:25.144 --> 31:27.059
Go have a life with her.

31:27.189 --> 31:28.495
You're happy.

31:29.844 --> 31:32.281
Just go be happy.

31:32.455 --> 31:33.979
No, I can't.

31:34.153 --> 31:35.719
MURPHY:Yes, you can.
Yes, you can.

31:35.850 --> 31:37.983
I'll talk my way out of this.
I'm charming.

31:38.157 --> 31:39.680
It'll all be okay.

31:39.854 --> 31:41.595
Go. Okay?No. If something

31:41.769 --> 31:42.901
were to happen to you,
I could never forgive myself.

31:46.513 --> 31:47.906
Go.

31:48.080 --> 31:49.516
Go, go. Hurry.

31:49.646 --> 31:53.085
Before they get here.
Go! Go! Hurry.

31:55.174 --> 31:56.262
Go.

31:56.436 --> 31:57.959
[door opens]

32:00.614 --> 32:02.050
[door closes]Oh...

32:03.704 --> 32:05.140
[sobs]

32:08.056 --> 32:10.102
[crying][engine starts outside]

32:13.018 --> 32:14.889
So I suspected Murphy
smuggled in the drugs

32:15.020 --> 32:16.978
in an audiobook,
which I traced.

32:17.109 --> 32:18.762
Lo and behold, who do I find
flushing the drugs?

32:18.937 --> 32:20.808
None other than Felix Bell.

32:20.982 --> 32:23.245
Josh, we actually needed
your help with these pills.

32:23.419 --> 32:24.986
I had Leo going through
transactions all day.

32:25.160 --> 32:26.683
That's not his job.

32:26.857 --> 32:27.989
They're related,
I'm telling you.

32:28.163 --> 32:29.730
Okay, so you actually
saw the drugs?

32:29.904 --> 32:32.211
No. No. No, I was too late.

32:32.385 --> 32:33.821
They'd already flushed them.

32:33.995 --> 32:36.258
But think about it.
Think about it.

32:36.432 --> 32:39.479
Would Murphy ever in her life
read a romance novel?

32:40.784 --> 32:42.830
Murphy's literary preferences?

32:43.004 --> 32:44.919
That's-that's what it is that
you're bringing to me?

32:45.093 --> 32:46.138
Well, well...You know what?
Enough, Josh!

32:46.268 --> 32:49.271
That Brad kid, he's dead.
He's dead.
