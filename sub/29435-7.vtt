WEBVTT

00:09.531 --> 00:11.185
WOMAN:
Let's just keep
our hands to ourselves.

00:11.228 --> 00:13.143
GIRL:
Uh, I was using my foot.

00:13.187 --> 00:14.927
WOMAN:
Okay, feet to yourselves, too.

00:14.971 --> 00:17.495
GIRL: Ugh, you're so lame.BOY: Say that again. I dare you.

00:17.539 --> 00:19.193
GIRL:
What? That's... You're lame.

00:19.236 --> 00:22.196
Shut up.Ow! Mom! Dylan hit me.

00:22.239 --> 00:23.980
No, no, she hit me first.Could the two of you

00:24.024 --> 00:26.069
just stop for one minute?
Please?He hit me first.

00:26.113 --> 00:29.290
Look around you.
Enjoy the scenery.

00:29.333 --> 00:30.856
This is all we're gonna
be doing this whole trip--

00:30.900 --> 00:32.945
just driving around
looking at boring stuff?

00:32.989 --> 00:34.860
It's not boring.Becca Wolser got to

00:34.904 --> 00:36.514
go to Disneyland for break.

00:36.558 --> 00:38.081
Yeah, well, Becca Wolser's
parents are divorced.

00:38.125 --> 00:39.430
They have to try harder.

00:39.474 --> 00:41.389
Wait, does that mean
we get to go to Disneyland

00:41.432 --> 00:43.130
if you get divorced?

00:43.173 --> 00:44.740
Ted.

00:44.783 --> 00:46.089
Could you please?

00:46.133 --> 00:47.830
Kids, listen
to your mother.

00:47.873 --> 00:50.789
Really?Listen to your mother.

00:50.833 --> 00:52.095
Or else.

00:53.140 --> 00:55.098
Look!
They have a pig pen!

00:55.142 --> 00:56.578
Why don't you guys
go check out the pigs?

00:56.621 --> 00:58.754
It'll be fun.
Just like Charlotte's Web.

00:58.797 --> 01:00.016
Do I have to go
with him?

01:00.060 --> 01:01.322
That book is for babies.Go look at the pigs!

01:01.365 --> 01:03.324
Okay, geez.

01:03.367 --> 01:06.153
You don't have to be
so mean about it.

01:06.196 --> 01:07.980
Ugh, it smells in here.[pigs grunting]

01:09.504 --> 01:11.941
What is that
they're eating?

01:15.379 --> 01:16.380
[screams]Oh, my God!

01:16.424 --> 01:18.121
Come on!
Oh, my God![screams]

01:19.383 --> 01:21.385
â™ª

01:51.198 --> 01:52.982
Hey. Morning.

01:53.025 --> 01:54.984
Hey, yeah, I know, I know,
I know, I'm late, I'm late.

01:55.027 --> 01:56.551
I was just doing
a little shopping.

01:59.641 --> 02:01.382
At the toy store?

02:04.428 --> 02:05.995
Nick, nice.

02:06.038 --> 02:07.910
I didn't know you collect
action figures.

02:07.953 --> 02:10.173
I'm really into the
McFarlane figurines myself.

02:10.217 --> 02:12.262
They're, you know,
kind of more detailed.

02:12.306 --> 02:13.350
Yeah, I love those.

02:13.394 --> 02:15.047
But these are not for me, McGee.

02:15.091 --> 02:16.266
These are for Elena's kid.

02:16.310 --> 02:18.573
Elena?Oh. Whoa, that's...

02:18.616 --> 02:21.445
Yeah, that's the woman
Nick has been dating.

02:21.489 --> 02:23.186
I didn't know she had a kid.

02:23.230 --> 02:25.797
Yeah, me neither. She dropped
that bomb on me last night.

02:25.841 --> 02:28.452
His name is Ricky.
I guess he's been away at camp.

02:28.496 --> 02:30.237
She didn't tell you
about this earlier?

02:30.280 --> 02:32.413
I think maybe, uh,
she was finding the,

02:32.456 --> 02:34.676
the right time. She didn't
want to scare me away.

02:34.719 --> 02:36.591
You seem to be taking it
pretty well.Yeah, I normally have

02:36.634 --> 02:38.375
a no rug rats policy,

02:38.419 --> 02:40.464
but look, she's older,
she's been married before.

02:40.508 --> 02:41.944
I totally get it.

02:41.987 --> 02:43.424
So when does Ricky
get back from camp?

02:43.467 --> 02:46.644
Today. She's bringing him
over to meet me.

02:46.688 --> 02:48.124
Wow.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.256
What?You know,

02:49.299 --> 02:51.519
meeting the kid--
that's a big step.

02:51.562 --> 02:54.435
I didn't know you and Elena
were that serious.

02:54.478 --> 02:57.394
I really like her.
I'm hoping this works out.

02:57.438 --> 02:59.483
Well, then, you'd better
hope that Ricky likes you.

02:59.527 --> 03:00.745
Oh, come on, man.

03:00.789 --> 03:02.486
With these toys?
He's gonna love me.

03:02.530 --> 03:04.358
Look at this.
This even looks like me.

03:06.316 --> 03:09.363
Geez. Who even
thinks something like that?

03:09.406 --> 03:10.581
Gear up.
Got a body.

03:10.625 --> 03:12.322
Bring boots.

03:12.366 --> 03:14.368
Hey, Gibbs.
Come on.

03:14.411 --> 03:16.413
No.Come on.

03:18.676 --> 03:21.549
Hey. Uh, two kids
on a family road trip

03:21.592 --> 03:22.767
found the body
this morning.

03:22.811 --> 03:23.942
They're still
pretty shaken up.

03:23.986 --> 03:25.466
You talk to the owner
of the farm?

03:25.509 --> 03:27.381
Yeah, he swears the body
wasn't here when he checked

03:27.424 --> 03:28.860
on the pigs last night.

03:28.904 --> 03:30.384
Who is our victim?

03:30.427 --> 03:33.517
Well, no ID other than
a Marine tattoo on his arm.

03:33.561 --> 03:35.345
I would run his prints,

03:35.389 --> 03:36.825
but he no longer has fingers.

03:36.868 --> 03:38.522
[phone rings]

03:39.697 --> 03:41.786
Yo, Jimmy. Yeah.

03:41.830 --> 03:43.571
No, no, they're
in the next stall.

03:43.614 --> 03:44.746
You can come out now.

03:44.789 --> 03:46.530
Jimmy is in the van

03:46.574 --> 03:48.532
because he's scared of pigs.

03:48.576 --> 03:50.752
JIMMY:
I'm coming in now.

03:50.795 --> 03:53.798
Really, Jimmy? Pigs?

03:53.842 --> 03:55.235
Well, look at them.

03:55.278 --> 03:56.845
They've got
razor-sharp teeth,

03:56.888 --> 03:59.891
they got the beady little eyes,
they follow your every move.

03:59.935 --> 04:01.632
We are still talking about
pigs here, right?

04:01.676 --> 04:03.417
JIMMY:
Okay, McGee. All right,

04:03.460 --> 04:05.549
I-I enjoy a BLT as much
as the next guy, all right?

04:05.593 --> 04:07.029
But alive,

04:07.072 --> 04:09.074
those things are monsters.

04:09.118 --> 04:10.772
[snorts]Aah! [stammers] No! No!

04:10.815 --> 04:12.904
No, you do not do that, Nick.[laughing]

04:14.776 --> 04:16.995
And playtime is over.Okay.

04:17.039 --> 04:20.347
[clears throat]
Okay. Getting back to work,

04:20.390 --> 04:21.522
our victim is, uh,

04:21.565 --> 04:24.568
late 30s to early 40s.

04:24.612 --> 04:26.483
Based on rigor mortis,

04:26.527 --> 04:27.615
I'd put the time of death

04:27.658 --> 04:29.356
at less than 12 hours.[pig squeals]

04:29.399 --> 04:30.661
I've got something
over here.

04:30.705 --> 04:33.229
Fresh tire tracks that
lead right to the pen.

04:37.494 --> 04:39.540
Could belong to
the farm owner.

04:39.583 --> 04:40.671
Maybe dropping off food?

04:40.715 --> 04:42.717
Or someone dropping off a body.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.371
At a pigsty?
There have got to be easier ways

04:44.414 --> 04:45.546
to get rid of a body.

04:45.589 --> 04:47.417
Yeah, but not as effective.

04:47.461 --> 04:49.332
I mean, a pack of pigs like that

04:49.376 --> 04:51.900
could devour an entire
human body in no time at all.

04:51.943 --> 04:54.468
Leave nothing behind
but hair and teeth.

04:54.511 --> 04:57.035
It's actually a rather ingenious
method of body disposal.

04:57.079 --> 04:59.342
But I still hate them.

04:59.386 --> 05:01.431
Well, if he wasn't killed here,
then where was he killed?

05:03.738 --> 05:05.392
Well, this may help.

05:05.435 --> 05:06.828
A room key.

05:09.352 --> 05:10.571
Tag's pretty chewed up,

05:10.614 --> 05:12.616
but I think
I can make out the name.

05:12.660 --> 05:15.053
The Monarch.
Monarch...

05:15.097 --> 05:17.273
Monarch?Monarch Motel.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.361
It's in Virginia.

05:18.405 --> 05:19.884
Bishop?Hm?

05:19.928 --> 05:21.712
Canvass the area.Yup.

05:21.756 --> 05:23.366
McGee, Torres, with me.

05:26.978 --> 05:29.024
No, w-wait, wait, wait, now,
you... You're not

05:29.067 --> 05:30.330
leaving me here... a-alone?

05:30.373 --> 05:32.027
[pigs squealing]

05:32.070 --> 05:35.073
MAN: Yeah, I rented the room
to a guy named Alex Shaw.

05:35.117 --> 05:37.467
Checked in about, I don't know,
five days ago.

05:37.511 --> 05:38.686
When was the last time
you saw him?

05:38.729 --> 05:40.122
Mm, not in a while.

05:40.165 --> 05:41.471
Why, is he in
some kind of trouble?

05:41.515 --> 05:43.517
'Cause I run
a clean business here.

05:43.560 --> 05:46.171
If he's into something,
I don't know anything about it.

06:02.318 --> 06:04.799
Well, the closets are empty.
There's no luggage.

06:06.104 --> 06:08.542
Bathroom's clean.

06:08.585 --> 06:10.848
This guy Shaw rents a room,
doesn't even use it?

06:15.462 --> 06:16.637
Hey, Nick.

06:16.680 --> 06:19.379
Pass me that chair over there,
will you?

06:34.829 --> 06:36.831
There's no duct work.

06:40.878 --> 06:42.445
I don't know what that is.

06:42.489 --> 06:45.535
Something chewed the TV cable.

06:45.579 --> 06:46.710
Rats, maybe.

06:48.669 --> 06:50.584
Where's your attic access?

07:09.516 --> 07:11.518
McGEE:
See anything up there, boss?Yeah.

07:14.999 --> 07:17.045
But it's not rats.

07:20.222 --> 07:21.919
Cameras.

07:25.227 --> 07:27.229
Lots of 'em.

07:35.019 --> 07:37.674
[grunts] Ow.

07:37.718 --> 07:41.635
Yeah, I found more cameras
in the other wing.

07:41.678 --> 07:44.594
There's cameras
above every room.

07:44.638 --> 07:47.684
Yeah, I've seen some freaky
deaky stuff, man, but this?

07:47.728 --> 07:49.425
MCGEE:
Yeah, it's like
the entire motel's

07:49.469 --> 07:52.167
been converted into
a giant peep show booth.

07:52.210 --> 07:54.125
Yeah, what kind of
pervert would do this?

07:54.169 --> 07:56.911
Well, whoever they are,
they know what they're doing.

07:56.954 --> 07:59.174
Pretty sophisticated stuff here.
Look at this.

08:02.612 --> 08:04.484
Infrared, high-resolution.

08:05.572 --> 08:07.356
Oh, so a sophisticated perv.

08:07.399 --> 08:11.099
Yeah, cameras are wired
to a, uh, CCTV hub over here.

08:11.142 --> 08:12.796
Ow.

08:13.884 --> 08:15.495
Why are these ceilings so low?

08:15.538 --> 08:17.497
Yeah, you know that's
what's wrong with this place.

08:18.323 --> 08:20.500
Low ceilings.

08:20.543 --> 08:23.851
Looks like the hub was
connected to a hard-line modem,

08:23.894 --> 08:25.026
which is now missing.

08:25.069 --> 08:26.680
We can't trace the signal.

08:26.723 --> 08:29.509
Question is what does this
all have to do

08:29.552 --> 08:31.075
with the body we found
at the farm?

08:32.642 --> 08:35.384
I-I told you. I don't know how
those cameras got up there,

08:35.427 --> 08:36.907
I swear.Never seen them before?

08:36.951 --> 08:38.909
I've never even been
up there before.

08:38.953 --> 08:41.782
Look, I-I only just bought this
place, like, eight months ago.

08:41.825 --> 08:43.871
Yeah? From who?Some old guy.

08:43.914 --> 08:46.308
Retired to, uh,
Scottsdale or wherever.

08:46.351 --> 08:49.659
I'm telling you,
I got nothing to do with this.

08:49.703 --> 08:51.269
I run a clean business here.

08:51.313 --> 08:53.489
Police say you have
eight prostitution busts

08:53.533 --> 08:54.751
in the last three weeks.

08:54.795 --> 08:57.406
Okay.

08:57.449 --> 08:58.886
Y... So I let the girls

08:58.929 --> 09:00.714
work out of the rooms
now and then.

09:00.757 --> 09:02.672
I'm not a Peeping Tom.

09:02.716 --> 09:04.195
I mean, th-this is wrong!

09:04.239 --> 09:07.590
Come on!
I got ethics, you know.

09:09.679 --> 09:11.768
I'm not touching anything
that came from that motel.

09:11.812 --> 09:13.814
Well, if we want to find out
who else was in the attic,

09:13.857 --> 09:15.685
we got to go through
the records.Mm.

09:15.729 --> 09:17.774
Ah. Hey, guys.
Yo.
Hey.

09:17.818 --> 09:19.602
Allow me to introduce you
to someone.

09:19.646 --> 09:21.473
This is Richard Devol.

09:21.517 --> 09:22.605
Hey.
How you doing?

09:22.649 --> 09:24.520
How are you?As in, uh, Ricky.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.174
Elena's son.

09:26.217 --> 09:28.089
I'm sorry, what?BISHOP: Mm-hmm.

09:28.132 --> 09:30.787
Yeah, actually, I, I prefer
to go by Richard, but uh...

09:30.831 --> 09:33.747
it's nice to finally
meet you.Yeah. Nice to meet you, too.

09:33.790 --> 09:35.705
Your mom said you were at camp.

09:35.749 --> 09:37.751
Yes, sir.
Camp Pendleton.

09:37.794 --> 09:39.753
I'm a staff sergeant there,
home on leave.

09:39.796 --> 09:41.015
Staff sergeant.This is so awesome.

09:41.058 --> 09:42.103
Oh, I know.

09:42.146 --> 09:43.670
Is, uh, is something wrong?

09:43.713 --> 09:45.715
I mean, were you expecting
someone else, or...

09:45.759 --> 09:46.977
No, no, no.
I was-I was expecting

09:47.021 --> 09:48.718
a big, tall,

09:48.762 --> 09:51.025
you know, grown adult man,
like you.

09:52.156 --> 09:54.028
Okay.I'm sorry to interrupt,

09:54.071 --> 09:55.290
Nicholas [chuckles].

09:55.333 --> 09:57.422
But I heard about
your little visitor,

09:57.466 --> 09:59.642
and I thought he might like
these coloring books.

09:59.686 --> 10:00.687
Okay, Ducky...

10:00.730 --> 10:02.297
I couldn't
decide between

10:02.340 --> 10:04.691
magical unicorns
and choo-choo trains,

10:04.734 --> 10:05.822
so I brought them both.

10:05.866 --> 10:07.868
They're really
quite delightful.Ah.

10:07.911 --> 10:09.870
I'm guessing those are for me.

10:14.352 --> 10:18.095
Perhaps I should've
brought bigger crayons.

10:18.139 --> 10:20.054
Uh, it's-it's okay.
Um, I just figured

10:20.097 --> 10:22.317
I'd take initiative
and we'd grab lunch,

10:22.360 --> 10:24.667
but... obviously, you need
to spend some time here.

10:24.711 --> 10:27.452
Yeah. We're swamped.
Uh, rain check?

10:27.496 --> 10:29.367
It's no problem.Great.

10:29.411 --> 10:32.675
So, it was, uh, it was very nice
to meet you, Ellie.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.808
Yeah, it was really nice
to meet you, too, Richard.

10:36.113 --> 10:37.680
Uh, hey, Ducky?DUCKY: Mm?

10:37.724 --> 10:39.160
You mind escorting him out?

10:39.203 --> 10:40.596
Uh, not at all.
[chuckles]

10:40.640 --> 10:41.771
Uh, this way.

10:42.859 --> 10:44.382
See you.

10:46.297 --> 10:48.952
How did you get his age
so wrong?

10:48.996 --> 10:50.824
Elena didn't tell you
how old he was?

10:50.867 --> 10:52.477
I don't know, man.
Marvin Gaye was playing,

10:52.521 --> 10:53.914
alcohol was involved.

10:53.957 --> 10:55.524
I-I guess I just
wasn't paying attention.

10:55.567 --> 10:57.961
Oh, my gosh. She's old enough
to have an adult son.

10:58.005 --> 10:59.920
Just imagine.
If you and Elena get married,

10:59.963 --> 11:01.486
you'll be his dad.

11:01.530 --> 11:02.705
[chuckling]

11:02.749 --> 11:04.707
Well, something's funny.

11:04.751 --> 11:06.883
Oh, yeah.
Boss, Torres...

11:06.927 --> 11:08.798
Go. Give me an update.
Let's go.

11:09.930 --> 11:11.975
We're still waiting
on the final autopsy,

11:12.019 --> 11:13.760
but DNA has confirmed our victim

11:13.803 --> 11:17.024
is Master Gunnery Sergeant
Aaron Shaw.

11:17.067 --> 11:19.679
Married, two kids,
highly decorated.

11:19.722 --> 11:21.158
Sounds like a pretty
stand-up guy.

11:21.202 --> 11:24.161
Then why was he staying
in a fleabag motel?

11:24.205 --> 11:26.686
Yeah, so his house is only
20 minutes from the motel.

11:26.729 --> 11:29.776
Uh, there's no obvious reason
for him to have been there.

11:29.819 --> 11:32.822
I'll give you a reason.
He was cheating on his wife.

11:32.866 --> 11:35.651
He had the motel room for an
entire week. Never even used it.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.392
So maybe Shaw
was the Peeping Tom.

11:37.435 --> 11:39.742
It's always the ones
you least expect.

11:39.786 --> 11:41.396
Well, if Shaw was the peeper,

11:41.439 --> 11:44.399
maybe someone discovered what he
was doing and killed him for it.

11:44.442 --> 11:46.923
We need more about Shaw.

11:51.232 --> 11:53.408
My husband was a good man.

11:53.451 --> 11:57.064
A decent man. Why would
anybody want to kill him?

11:57.107 --> 11:59.327
Did you notice anything off

11:59.370 --> 12:01.808
about how he was
acting recently?

12:01.851 --> 12:04.506
No. Um, I-I mean,

12:04.549 --> 12:07.335
he was-he was tired more.
He-he'd been working

12:07.378 --> 12:09.598
later hours.Why later hours?

12:09.641 --> 12:12.122
He took on a side job,
something with the military.

12:12.166 --> 12:14.951
Uh, he couldn't
tell me much about it, so...

12:15.996 --> 12:17.824
Mrs. Shaw, can you think
of any reason

12:17.867 --> 12:21.088
your husband would've had
a room at the Monarch Motel?

12:21.131 --> 12:22.176
No.

12:24.787 --> 12:27.659
Was he having an affair?
Or...

12:30.053 --> 12:31.794
Why do you keep
looking at each other?

12:31.838 --> 12:34.536
I mean, what are you not
telling me about my husband?

12:34.579 --> 12:35.798
Uh, Mrs. Shaw,

12:35.842 --> 12:38.932
we found hidden cameras inside

12:38.975 --> 12:40.629
the same motel your
husband checked into.

12:40.672 --> 12:42.674
Wait, then you-you think
that Aaron

12:42.718 --> 12:44.546
had something to do with that?

12:44.589 --> 12:46.809
We're still gathering
some facts here, but...No, I know

12:46.853 --> 12:49.856
my husband.
He would never do that. He...

12:49.899 --> 12:51.161
He's a loving husband
and father,

12:51.205 --> 12:53.816
he's not some kind of,
like, sex pervert.

12:53.860 --> 12:56.993
Listen, we're not saying
that he is. Okay?

12:57.037 --> 12:59.387
I know this is
a lot to digest.

12:59.430 --> 13:01.041
But voyeuristic disorder

13:01.084 --> 13:03.173
is less about sex
and more about secrets.

13:03.217 --> 13:05.132
And from everything you're
telling us, it sounds like

13:05.175 --> 13:07.090
your husband had a lot of them.

13:09.963 --> 13:12.574
Kasie, what do you got?
Wow.

13:12.617 --> 13:15.098
What is that smell?That smell, Gibbs,

13:15.142 --> 13:18.841
is Sus scrofaexcrement,
otherwise known as pig poop.

13:18.885 --> 13:22.105
And guess who you can
thank for the stench.Jimmy Palmer.

13:22.149 --> 13:24.847
[inhales] Because the pigs
ate so much of our victim,

13:24.891 --> 13:27.545
it was Jimmy's bright idea that
we should go through their waste

13:27.589 --> 13:30.548
to see if they didn't
also eat any evidence.

13:30.592 --> 13:31.985
You know, when I
took this job,

13:32.028 --> 13:33.116
sifting through pig poop--
definitely not

13:33.160 --> 13:34.596
what I had in mind.

13:34.639 --> 13:35.902
Kasie.You're right.

13:35.945 --> 13:36.903
I am a professional.

13:36.946 --> 13:38.905
I will rise above it.

13:38.948 --> 13:41.385
Okay, so... Moving on.

13:41.429 --> 13:42.909
Though the pigpen hasn't yielded

13:42.952 --> 13:44.475
anything useful yet,

13:44.519 --> 13:46.521
the motel has proved
interesting.

13:46.564 --> 13:48.305
Ooh, before I forget.

13:48.349 --> 13:49.785
Got your message,
and here is

13:49.829 --> 13:51.831
the ammonium dichromate
you wanted.

13:56.009 --> 13:57.532
Pretty flammable stuff.

13:57.575 --> 13:59.969
I meant to ask,
is that for a case or...

14:01.623 --> 14:03.973
You're not gonna
tell me, are you?

14:04.017 --> 14:06.628
I should probably just mind
my own business, yeah?

14:06.671 --> 14:08.412
Okay.
Moving on again.

14:08.456 --> 14:12.025
Jimmy sent up some fibers
he found in Shaw's lungs,

14:12.068 --> 14:13.156
or what's left of them, anyway.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.462
I ran them through Mass Spec

14:14.505 --> 14:16.899
and they came back as
fiberglass particles.

14:16.943 --> 14:18.205
Fiberglass?

14:18.248 --> 14:20.033
Like in insulation?Not just any insulation.

14:20.076 --> 14:23.906
The same insulation
from the motel attic.

14:23.950 --> 14:26.517
For the particles to end up
in Shaw's lungs, he would've had

14:26.561 --> 14:28.041
to be up there a lot.

14:28.084 --> 14:29.999
I think Shaw
was our Peeping Tom.

14:30.043 --> 14:32.001
McGEE:
He might've been
more than that.

14:32.045 --> 14:34.003
Been digging...

14:34.047 --> 14:36.005
What is that smell?
You guys smell that?

14:36.049 --> 14:37.528
Come on, McGee.
Get on with it.

14:37.572 --> 14:39.008
Got it.
You mind?

14:40.749 --> 14:43.099
I was digging into
Shaw's bank accounts.

14:43.143 --> 14:45.058
Recently he received a number
of payments that I traced

14:45.101 --> 14:46.929
back to an Eric Riley.

14:50.237 --> 14:51.499
Virginia congressman?

14:51.542 --> 14:54.023
So we've got a guy
recording people

14:54.067 --> 14:57.070
at a shady motel and getting
payments from a congressman.

14:57.113 --> 14:59.072
Maybe Shaw isn't a voyeur.

14:59.115 --> 15:01.683
He's a blackmailer.

15:02.989 --> 15:04.991
It's time we start getting
honest with each other.

15:05.034 --> 15:07.471
And if the good people of
Virginia reelect me to Congress,

15:07.515 --> 15:09.821
I promise I'm gonna fight
for the truth every day.

15:09.865 --> 15:11.127
[reporters clamoring]

15:11.171 --> 15:13.738
[indistinct whispering]

15:13.782 --> 15:15.915
Okay.
That's enough for now.

15:17.351 --> 15:19.570
So you guys are NCIS?

15:19.614 --> 15:22.008
I'm a big fan of the military.
How can I help?

15:22.051 --> 15:24.010
Special Agent Gibbs and Bishop.

15:24.053 --> 15:25.794
We have questions
about Aaron Shaw.

15:25.837 --> 15:27.404
What's this about?
Did something happen?

15:27.448 --> 15:30.016
We found his body this morning.
He was murdered.

15:30.059 --> 15:31.887
Oh, God.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.236
Was he blackmailing you?

15:36.109 --> 15:37.197
Congressman.

15:37.240 --> 15:38.850
No.

15:40.504 --> 15:42.942
But I think I might've
gotten him killed.

15:53.822 --> 15:57.478
About a month ago, I met a woman
at a campaign dinner.

15:57.521 --> 15:59.697
We had a few drinks...

16:00.960 --> 16:02.831
...ended up in a motel.

16:03.745 --> 16:05.747
The Monarch Motel?

16:05.790 --> 16:08.445
Yeah.So I guess
your honesty campaign

16:08.489 --> 16:10.752
doesn't apply to your wife?You're right.

16:10.795 --> 16:13.755
I screwed up. It was just...
it was just one stupid night

16:13.798 --> 16:15.757
I wish I could get back.

16:15.800 --> 16:18.194
But then I started getting
these anonymous e-mails.

16:18.238 --> 16:19.717
Someone was threatening
to go public

16:19.761 --> 16:21.850
with what I did
unless I paid up.

16:21.893 --> 16:23.808
Well, they had video proof.

16:23.852 --> 16:26.333
I panicked.

16:26.376 --> 16:29.118
I didn't know what else to do.
I-I'm up for reelection.

16:29.162 --> 16:31.425
I couldn't go
to the police, so...

16:31.468 --> 16:33.818
I went to Aaron
for help.Why Aaron?

16:33.862 --> 16:36.604
We grew up together.
I knew I could trust him.

16:36.647 --> 16:38.127
And he used to work
in intelligence.

16:38.171 --> 16:40.738
So I figured if a guy like Aaron
could find bin Laden...

16:40.782 --> 16:42.392
He could find your blackmailer.

16:46.179 --> 16:48.964
What about payments?Well, I just
gave him enough

16:49.008 --> 16:51.619
to cover the costs of the motel,
whatever else he needed.

16:51.662 --> 16:53.142
That was about
a week ago,

16:53.186 --> 16:55.840
the last time I saw him.

16:59.888 --> 17:02.369
You know what? My election
is not important right now.

17:02.412 --> 17:04.458
My friend was killed.

17:04.501 --> 17:07.939
Anything you need from me,
my office, the Hill...

17:09.158 --> 17:10.986
...it's yours.

17:15.556 --> 17:16.861
Yeah, table for two.

17:16.905 --> 17:18.298
Torres.

17:19.603 --> 17:21.257
Thank you.

17:21.301 --> 17:22.606
Making dinner plans?Yeah.

17:22.650 --> 17:24.391
I'm taking Elena out tonight.

17:24.434 --> 17:28.090
Hopefully, we can talk about
this, uh, adult son thing.

17:28.134 --> 17:30.614
You know, I got to admit, Nick,
you're taking this pretty well.

17:30.658 --> 17:31.920
Especially considering
who Richard is.

17:31.963 --> 17:33.400
What are you talking about?

17:33.443 --> 17:35.402
I took the liberty of, uh,
looking him up.

17:35.445 --> 17:38.013
Turns out Richard
is not just a Marine,

17:38.057 --> 17:39.623
he is special ops.

17:39.667 --> 17:41.495
He's seen some
very heavy action.

17:41.538 --> 17:42.974
A real Captain America badass.

17:43.018 --> 17:45.977
And you are sleeping
with his mother.

17:46.021 --> 17:49.068
[chuckles]
Okay.

17:49.938 --> 17:51.809
Give me an update.

17:51.853 --> 17:54.725
Well, we got a theory
about Shaw's murder.

17:54.769 --> 17:56.205
He did exactly what
his congressman buddy

17:56.249 --> 17:58.033
asked him to do,
found the blackmailer,

17:58.077 --> 17:59.556
who then killed him.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.036
Who's our blackmailer?

18:01.080 --> 18:02.211
Confirmed kills, huh?

18:02.255 --> 18:04.039
Torres.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.867
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

18:05.910 --> 18:07.521
So, uh, yeah, we
weren't able to find

18:07.564 --> 18:09.262
any additional prints
in the attic.

18:09.305 --> 18:11.133
So that clears our motel owner.

18:11.177 --> 18:12.526
Records didn't help, either.

18:12.569 --> 18:14.919
What about the female
Riley had in the motel?

18:14.963 --> 18:16.486
She is a dead end, too.

18:16.530 --> 18:18.836
No one at the campaign dinner
remembers seeing her,

18:18.880 --> 18:20.055
and Riley booked the motel,

18:20.099 --> 18:22.188
so she couldn't have known
about the cameras.

18:22.231 --> 18:24.538
What about Shaw's phone record?Last call he made was to

18:24.581 --> 18:26.061
a Master Sergeant Neil Koh,

18:26.105 --> 18:27.410
currently stationed
in Afghanistan.

18:27.454 --> 18:29.108
He's out on a mission right now.

18:29.151 --> 18:30.848
We're trying to get
ahold of him.[phone ringing]

18:30.892 --> 18:32.850
Keep after.

18:32.894 --> 18:34.243
Find the blackmailer.

18:34.287 --> 18:36.506
On the way down, Palmer.

18:36.550 --> 18:39.118
Oh, how the tables have turned.

18:39.161 --> 18:41.946
Not so tough now, huh?

18:41.990 --> 18:42.947
Palmer!Oh! G-Gibbs.

18:42.991 --> 18:44.471
I...
[laughs]

18:44.514 --> 18:46.908
I-I was just, uh...Talking to a pig skull?

18:46.951 --> 18:47.952
No.

18:49.563 --> 18:51.913
Yes, I was.
But it is related to the case.

18:51.956 --> 18:53.871
You see, I couldn't figure
out which wounds came

18:53.915 --> 18:55.308
from our killer and which
came from the pigs,

18:55.351 --> 18:57.266
so I borrowed a pig skull
from the local museum.

18:57.310 --> 19:00.139
I then measured
the radius of the bite

19:00.182 --> 19:02.489
and compared it against
the wounds on Shaw's body.

19:02.532 --> 19:03.925
Yeah, I get it. How'd he die?Then...

19:03.968 --> 19:06.232
Uh, blunt force trauma
to the head.By what?

19:06.275 --> 19:09.060
Uh, but cranial fractures,
along with several contusions

19:09.104 --> 19:11.802
suggest he was beaten to death.By what?

19:13.500 --> 19:15.763
I found these

19:15.806 --> 19:18.026
embedded in his brain tissue.

19:18.069 --> 19:19.854
What is that? Wood?

19:19.897 --> 19:22.770
Yeah. Might've just come from
the fence around the pigpen.

19:22.813 --> 19:25.903
It could've come
from a lot of things, Jim.

19:25.947 --> 19:27.557
Ah, Jethro.

19:27.601 --> 19:29.646
I was told
I'd find you here.

19:29.690 --> 19:31.170
I got your message.

19:31.213 --> 19:35.870
You need a book
on ancient Roman history?

19:35.913 --> 19:38.046
I think this will
give you what you want.

19:38.089 --> 19:40.614
But I-I'm fascinated
that you're taking an interest

19:40.657 --> 19:42.877
in classical antiquity.

19:42.920 --> 19:45.706
Now, this is a
particular favorite of mine.

19:45.749 --> 19:48.187
It's meticulously researched,
with copious footnotes

19:48.230 --> 19:49.710
and appendices.

19:49.753 --> 19:51.755
Thanks, Doc.
Hope it's got pictures.

19:54.149 --> 19:57.631
Well, yes, it, uh,
has illustrations.

19:57.674 --> 19:59.589
Are you looking
for something specific?

19:59.633 --> 20:02.026
Appreciate it.
Get this up to Kasie.

20:02.070 --> 20:03.898
[phone beeps]

20:05.682 --> 20:08.381
Now, what do you suppose
that was all about?

20:08.424 --> 20:10.165
Well, with-with Jethro,

20:10.209 --> 20:14.213
it's better just
to enjoy the mystery.

20:14.256 --> 20:16.127
[chuckles]

20:16.171 --> 20:18.260
[soft piano music playing]

20:18.304 --> 20:20.088
Two, so just let me know.

20:20.131 --> 20:21.959
Um...

20:22.003 --> 20:23.831
He said it would be
another minute.

20:23.874 --> 20:25.224
Ah.

20:26.747 --> 20:28.052
Listen,

20:28.096 --> 20:31.099
about the mix-up
today with Ricky, I...

20:31.142 --> 20:33.536
Oh, you mean, uh, Richard?

20:33.580 --> 20:36.104
I feel horrible.

20:36.147 --> 20:38.193
I can't imagine
how surprised you must've been.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.455
It was a shock.

20:39.499 --> 20:42.284
But I think
it was my fault. I...

20:42.328 --> 20:45.113
I wasn't listening
when you said how old he was.

20:45.156 --> 20:46.941
No, I should've told you sooner.

20:46.984 --> 20:50.205
It's just, when you're dating,

20:50.249 --> 20:53.164
telling people that you were
a teen mom isn't exactly the...

20:53.208 --> 20:55.341
It's cool.
I-I don't care.

20:56.777 --> 20:59.083
Do I regret buying him toys?
Yes.

20:59.127 --> 21:00.302
You bought him toys?Yeah.

21:00.346 --> 21:02.783
[laughs]:
No! Oh!

21:02.826 --> 21:05.089
Yeah. One of the action figures
looked like me, too.

21:05.133 --> 21:06.656
Really?

21:06.700 --> 21:09.268
Well, I bet he was really cute.

21:09.311 --> 21:10.965
Hey. Mom.

21:11.008 --> 21:13.446
What a surprise.Ricky.

21:13.489 --> 21:15.361
[laughs]
What are you doing here?

21:15.404 --> 21:18.015
Oh, I was just, uh... I'm
grabbing a bite with a friend.

21:18.059 --> 21:20.191
Uh, Mom, this is, um...
this is Ellie.

21:20.235 --> 21:21.236
Oh!

21:21.280 --> 21:23.978
God. Hi.
Okay.

21:24.021 --> 21:25.762
Yeah, so they actually...
they work together.

21:25.806 --> 21:27.764
[laughing]: Hi.
I can't believe you're here.

21:27.808 --> 21:29.331
This is such a coincidence.Yeah.

21:29.375 --> 21:31.115
I mean, Ellie says
this is the best

21:31.159 --> 21:32.465
Italian in town, so...Yeah, it is.

21:32.508 --> 21:34.075
It is.

21:34.118 --> 21:35.859
Well, why don't we
all sit together?

21:35.903 --> 21:36.904
Just join tables?

21:36.947 --> 21:38.209
Yeah, that's a great idea.

21:38.253 --> 21:40.037
Uh...

21:40.081 --> 21:42.213
it's an idea.

21:43.693 --> 21:46.087
Kasie, hey.
You're working late.

21:46.130 --> 21:47.393
How come you're not
in your lab?

21:47.436 --> 21:49.090
I'm still airing it out.

21:49.133 --> 21:50.874
I hung up about 50
air fresheners,

21:50.918 --> 21:53.094
and now I don't know
what stinks more--

21:53.137 --> 21:54.487
the fresheners or the pig poop.

21:54.530 --> 21:57.794
Yeah, no, I'm still
gonna go with the pig poop.

21:57.838 --> 21:59.100
What's that?

21:59.143 --> 22:01.232
Oh, you know,
it's just the breakthrough

22:01.276 --> 22:03.278
that is going to solve the case.

22:03.322 --> 22:04.714
Remember, up in the motel attic,

22:04.758 --> 22:06.107
how you kept bumping your head?

22:06.150 --> 22:08.065
Hey, don't remind me.
It still hurts.

22:08.109 --> 22:09.589
Well, it got me to thinking

22:09.632 --> 22:12.200
if anyone else might have
bumped their head, too.

22:12.243 --> 22:14.376
Like our killer.
So

22:14.420 --> 22:16.552
I checked all the crossbeams,
and this one

22:16.596 --> 22:19.686
tested positive for blood.

22:19.729 --> 22:21.122
Kasie, that's genius.

22:21.165 --> 22:22.210
You know, you helped, too.

22:22.253 --> 22:23.777
If you weren't built
like Bigfoot,

22:23.820 --> 22:25.909
I never would have
thought of it.

22:25.953 --> 22:27.346
Thank you.
Yeah.

22:27.389 --> 22:29.260
So, I ran the DNA,

22:29.304 --> 22:31.393
and a guy named
Daniel Mulgrew came up.

22:31.437 --> 22:33.482
36, divorced,

22:33.526 --> 22:36.616
runs his own heating and
air-conditioning business.

22:36.659 --> 22:38.052
Well, makes sense.

22:38.095 --> 22:40.184
An HVAC guy could easily
access an attic

22:40.228 --> 22:41.490
without arousing suspicion.

22:41.534 --> 22:42.970
Maybe he was up
there installing

22:43.013 --> 22:44.188
more than just
AC ducts.

22:44.232 --> 22:45.320
And that's not all.

22:45.364 --> 22:46.930
He has a rap sheet:

22:46.974 --> 22:49.019
fraud, hacking,
cyber crimes.

22:49.063 --> 22:52.196
And he recently applied
for a passport.

22:52.240 --> 22:54.634
Hmm.

22:54.677 --> 22:57.811
This is fun, right,
the four of us?

22:57.854 --> 23:00.117
Mm-hmm.

23:00.161 --> 23:02.119
I wonder how the
fish is prepared.

23:02.163 --> 23:04.557
You know what? I was actually
thinking the same thing.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.167
Hey, excuse me, waiter.

23:06.210 --> 23:07.298
Yes, sir.

23:09.475 --> 23:11.477
What are you doing here?

23:11.520 --> 23:12.869
Um, he asked me out.

23:12.913 --> 23:14.480
If I had known
you were gonna be here,

23:14.523 --> 23:15.698
I never would have come.

23:15.742 --> 23:17.265
Why are you even
with him?

23:17.308 --> 23:18.832
What do you mean?
He's cute.

23:18.875 --> 23:20.137
He's my girlfriend's son.

23:20.181 --> 23:21.835
He's too young for you.
This is sick.

23:21.878 --> 23:23.271
[scoffing]:
Okay.

23:23.314 --> 23:24.881
You're not too young for her?That is different.

23:24.925 --> 23:26.361
I'm irresistible.
She couldn't help herself.

23:26.405 --> 23:27.667
You should know better.

23:27.710 --> 23:29.538
Oh, please.

23:31.366 --> 23:32.498
Everything okay?

23:32.541 --> 23:34.848
What? Yeah.

23:34.891 --> 23:36.502
Yeah, I hope this isn't
awkward for you two.

23:36.545 --> 23:39.374
No, it's not
awkward at... all.No, this is great.

23:39.418 --> 23:40.941
Why don't we just order?

23:40.984 --> 23:42.943
Everything looks delicious.

23:42.986 --> 23:44.771
Yes, it does.

23:44.814 --> 23:47.208
This looks way better than what
they give us at Pendleton.

23:47.251 --> 23:48.688
Sometimes the food's so bad,

23:48.731 --> 23:50.472
we got to pray
after we eat, you know?[chuckles]

23:50.516 --> 23:53.736
[laughing loudly]

23:53.780 --> 23:54.737
Sorry.

23:54.781 --> 23:56.347
How about a drink?

23:56.391 --> 23:57.914
Who's ready for
a glass of wine?

23:57.958 --> 23:59.481
Well, count me in.

23:59.525 --> 24:02.179
Uh, may I order?
I'll, uh...

24:03.920 --> 24:05.356
What?

24:05.400 --> 24:07.402
Nothing.
Just didn't know you had

24:07.446 --> 24:09.186
such a sophisticated palate.

24:09.230 --> 24:11.101
I drink wine.Yeah, you do.

24:11.145 --> 24:14.191
[laughing loudly]

24:14.235 --> 24:16.629
Oh, that's too funny.

24:16.672 --> 24:17.978
I don't laugh like that.

24:18.021 --> 24:20.197
Yeah, that's right--
you don't.

24:20.241 --> 24:22.504
So...

24:22.548 --> 24:25.333
how long have the two
of you worked together?

24:27.117 --> 24:29.859
[cell phones
chiming and buzzing]

24:29.903 --> 24:32.601
Oh. Uh, it's McGee.
They got a suspect.

24:32.645 --> 24:34.473
TORRES:
Yeah, Gibbs wants us
to pick him up.

24:34.516 --> 24:36.300
I'm so sorry.Sorry.

24:36.344 --> 24:37.911
Um, it was really
nice to meet you.

24:37.954 --> 24:39.129
I'll call you.

24:39.173 --> 24:40.479
BISHOP:
Richard, I'll text you.

24:52.708 --> 24:54.449
Nick, thanks
for coming, man.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.625
Sorry to interrupt your date.No worries.

24:59.149 --> 25:01.064
Yeah. Don't ask.

25:01.978 --> 25:03.153
Suspect?

25:03.197 --> 25:04.285
Daniel Mulgrew.

25:04.328 --> 25:05.286
Lives right here in back.

25:08.724 --> 25:10.509
[knocks]

25:23.478 --> 25:25.219
Hey, yo.

25:28.483 --> 25:30.267
You got me?

25:31.660 --> 25:32.835
Federal agents!

25:32.879 --> 25:34.184
Hands up!

25:44.064 --> 25:47.546
Uh... hey, guys.

25:47.589 --> 25:49.983
I thought you said the cameras
at the motel were disabled.

25:51.811 --> 25:53.464
They were.

25:54.640 --> 25:56.816
Then where are
all these images from?

26:08.523 --> 26:11.091
Yeah, I understand you want
to see the footage, but I can't.

26:11.134 --> 26:12.962
MAN [over phone]:
I don't understand
why I can't...

26:13.006 --> 26:15.138
Because its evidence
in a murder investigation.

26:15.182 --> 26:16.705
That's why.[phone beeps]

26:16.749 --> 26:18.489
ASSISTANT:
Director, Congressman Potterway

26:18.533 --> 26:20.100
is on line two,
Senator Mannerton on three,

26:20.143 --> 26:22.102
and the SECDEF's office
is on four.

26:22.145 --> 26:23.407
Take a message.

26:23.451 --> 26:24.670
And bring me some aspirin,
please.

26:24.713 --> 26:26.149
MAN [over phone]: Hello?Yes.

26:26.193 --> 26:27.498
Do we understand each other now?

26:27.542 --> 26:28.848
Uh, y-yes,
as soon as we're done,

26:28.891 --> 26:30.327
we will release the footage.

26:30.371 --> 26:32.547
[over phone]: Thank you.No, thank you,

26:32.591 --> 26:33.592
Senator Algerwood.

26:33.635 --> 26:34.680
Geez.

26:34.723 --> 26:36.682
Little busy?[sighs]

26:36.725 --> 26:39.423
Ever since the news leaked,
I got every politician in town

26:39.467 --> 26:41.077
calling to see
the camera footage.

26:41.121 --> 26:43.863
They've all taken a very sudden
interest in this case.

26:43.906 --> 26:45.516
Yeah, well, sounds like
Congressman Riley

26:45.560 --> 26:47.388
wasn't the only one
with something to hide.

26:47.431 --> 26:49.346
I want this off my plate,
Gibbs, fast.

26:49.390 --> 26:50.609
Where are we?

26:50.652 --> 26:53.873
Our HVAC guy--
ran a blackmail ring.

26:53.916 --> 26:57.354
Has cameras in 13 motels
in the DC area.

26:58.573 --> 26:59.705
Used his HVAC gig

26:59.748 --> 27:02.533
as cover to gain access.

27:02.577 --> 27:05.362
Devious, but smart.

27:05.406 --> 27:07.016
So, is there anything
in the footage

27:07.060 --> 27:08.757
related to Shaw's death?Yeah, we're still looking.

27:08.801 --> 27:10.541
We got over 500 hours to watch.

27:10.585 --> 27:13.240
So Shaw discovers
the HVAC guy is the blackmailer,

27:13.283 --> 27:14.850
the HVAC guy kills him.

27:14.894 --> 27:16.460
Then what?Kills himself.

27:16.504 --> 27:18.549
Oh, how convenient.You think?

27:18.593 --> 27:19.812
So our killer's still out there.

27:19.855 --> 27:22.423
Unfortunately, so is
our blackmailer.

27:22.466 --> 27:23.816
Mulgrew is not our guy.

27:23.859 --> 27:25.382
He was working for someone else.

27:29.604 --> 27:31.562
Great. [sighs]

27:31.606 --> 27:33.303
Well, I hacked
into Mulgrew's account

27:33.347 --> 27:36.263
and found a number of e-mails
between him and his boss.

27:36.306 --> 27:38.004
Looks like Mulgrew
was just the I.T. guy,

27:38.047 --> 27:39.440
responsible
for setting up cameras

27:39.483 --> 27:41.137
and doing the recordings.

27:41.181 --> 27:44.358
Blackmailers have I.T. guys now?
That's crazy.

27:44.401 --> 27:46.142
Apparently,
Mulgrew thought so, too.

27:46.186 --> 27:47.666
He'd recently brought up
the idea of quitting,

27:47.709 --> 27:50.277
but his boss
didn't take it so well.

27:52.975 --> 27:54.542
BISHOP:
"You can't stop.
I won't let you.

27:54.585 --> 27:56.544
I'll tell everyone
what you did."

27:56.587 --> 27:58.067
Who was Mulgrew working for?

27:58.111 --> 28:00.374
We're, uh, trying to trace
the e-mails now.

28:00.417 --> 28:02.115
TORRES:
I looked into
Mulgrew's history.

28:02.158 --> 28:04.465
Used to work as a contractor
doing surveillance work.

28:04.508 --> 28:06.032
Surveillance-- that fits.

28:06.075 --> 28:08.251
His main client
was a company called...

28:08.295 --> 28:10.950
Novak Security
Consultants.

28:10.993 --> 28:12.647
Wait.
I know that company.

28:12.691 --> 28:14.475
That's one of NSA's
front companies.

28:14.518 --> 28:16.651
I-I remember seeing their names
when I worked there.

28:16.695 --> 28:18.435
Mulgrew used to work
for the NSA?

28:18.479 --> 28:20.568
Uh, yeah, his
access manager

28:20.611 --> 28:22.613
was someone named
Patrick Norian.

28:22.657 --> 28:24.746
Yeah. Check it out.
Take Torres.

28:24.790 --> 28:26.356
Uh, actually, Gibbs,

28:26.400 --> 28:27.662
uh, can McGee go?[phone ringing]

28:27.706 --> 28:30.665
I was gonna go downstairs
and check on Jimmy.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.623
McGee, go.

28:33.668 --> 28:36.976
Hey. How many times
you gonna call me, amigo?

28:37.019 --> 28:40.022
Yeah, I have the ammonium.

28:40.066 --> 28:41.241
[chuckling]:
Bring it with me later.

28:41.284 --> 28:42.242
Okay.

28:42.285 --> 28:43.591
Hey, uh, I'll catch up with you.

28:43.634 --> 28:44.635
All right.

28:46.550 --> 28:48.814
Bye.

28:48.857 --> 28:50.685
Hey. Nick.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.469
What up?Uh...

28:53.688 --> 28:55.298
Are we okay?

28:55.342 --> 28:57.083
'Cause, if you're still upset
about last night, I...

28:57.126 --> 28:58.606
Oh, no, we're fine.

28:58.649 --> 29:00.782
Look, if you want
to date Richard, be my guest.

29:00.826 --> 29:02.784
I don't care who you
date, just like...

29:02.828 --> 29:05.047
you don't care who I date.

29:05.091 --> 29:06.527
Right?

29:06.570 --> 29:08.442
Right.
Of course.

29:08.485 --> 29:09.791
Then we're good.

29:09.835 --> 29:11.793
Yeah, we're good.

29:18.234 --> 29:19.845
JIMMY:
The cuts on
Mulgrew's wrists

29:19.888 --> 29:22.108
ran lengthwise along
the radial artery,

29:22.151 --> 29:24.327
common for this
type of suicide.

29:24.371 --> 29:27.766
But I did find rope indentations
on the epidermis,

29:27.809 --> 29:29.898
suggesting that he was
tied to his chair

29:29.942 --> 29:31.682
prior to being cut, so...

29:31.726 --> 29:33.684
once again, Gibbs was right.

29:33.728 --> 29:36.383
This suicide was staged.

29:36.426 --> 29:38.211
[sighs]

29:38.254 --> 29:40.735
I also found tentacles growing
out of the victim's forehead.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.519
What?

29:42.563 --> 29:44.391
You still bothered
about last night?

29:44.434 --> 29:47.089
I just can't believe
that Bishop went out with him.

29:47.133 --> 29:49.526
He's my girlfriend's son.

29:49.570 --> 29:50.919
I mean,
isn't that weird?

29:50.963 --> 29:52.660
Or is it just me?

29:52.703 --> 29:53.574
No, no, it's not just you.

29:53.617 --> 29:54.967
I mean, it's definitely weird.

29:55.010 --> 29:56.969
What is she trying to do?
Is she trying to

29:57.012 --> 29:58.144
torpedo my relationship
with Elena?

29:58.187 --> 29:59.536
Okay, all right.

29:59.580 --> 30:01.538
Wh-What you are feeling
right now,

30:01.582 --> 30:02.931
this is exactly why
we have that rule:

30:02.975 --> 30:05.238
you never date a coworker.

30:05.281 --> 30:06.717
I...Okay, first of all,
I didn't date her.

30:06.761 --> 30:08.328
I didn't go on
a date with her.O-Okay, all-all right.

30:08.371 --> 30:09.764
I went on a date with Elena.Fine, fine, fine.
You never...

30:09.808 --> 30:11.635
you never double-date
with a coworker, all right?

30:11.679 --> 30:14.334
The point is the line between
personal and professional

30:14.377 --> 30:15.988
can sometimes be tricky.

30:16.031 --> 30:17.990
[sighs]
After Tony and Ziva,

30:18.033 --> 30:19.905
I mean, we all learned
that lesson big-time.

30:19.948 --> 30:21.950
Tony and Ziva.

30:22.908 --> 30:24.518
What went wrong there?

30:24.561 --> 30:26.259
Well, it started off great.

30:26.302 --> 30:28.870
I mean, they were
constantly flirting.

30:28.914 --> 30:31.090
Constantly fighting, too,
but, um...

30:31.133 --> 30:34.441
yeah, I knew something
was going on there.

30:34.484 --> 30:35.790
You?

30:35.834 --> 30:37.096
Yeah, yeah, I-I got sort of

30:37.139 --> 30:39.185
a sixth sense
about these sort of things.

30:39.228 --> 30:42.318
I can spot an office romance
from a mile away.

30:42.362 --> 30:44.451
Take you and Bishop,
for instance.Mm-hmm.

30:44.494 --> 30:46.322
I don't see anything.
There's nothing there.

30:46.366 --> 30:48.150
Zero chemistry.

30:51.284 --> 30:52.459
BISHOP: I can't believe
he's still mad at me.

30:52.502 --> 30:53.939
McGEE: You know Torres.

30:53.982 --> 30:55.810
He just needs
to cool off a little bit.Yeah, but

30:55.854 --> 30:58.117
last year he deleted
texts from my phone,

30:58.160 --> 30:59.553
interfered with
my dating life,

30:59.596 --> 31:01.120
and now he's giving me
the cold shoulder?

31:01.163 --> 31:03.122
I mean, it just
pisses me off.

31:03.165 --> 31:05.254
Well, maybe that's not
the only reason you're upset.

31:05.298 --> 31:06.734
What do you mean?

31:06.777 --> 31:08.127
Well, I'm just saying,

31:08.170 --> 31:09.476
maybe you went out
with Richard

31:09.519 --> 31:11.260
just to tweak Torres
a little bit,

31:11.304 --> 31:12.783
and now you feel bad
about it.

31:12.827 --> 31:14.046
[scoffs] Okay.

31:14.089 --> 31:15.569
Whose side are
you on, anyway?

31:15.612 --> 31:18.180
I'm on whichever side gets me
out of this conversation.

31:18.224 --> 31:20.182
[door opens][indistinct chatter]

31:20.226 --> 31:21.357
BISHOP:
Oh, there's our guy.

31:21.401 --> 31:22.706
Uh, excuse me.

31:22.750 --> 31:24.360
Patrick Norian?

31:24.404 --> 31:26.232
Yes.NCIS.

31:26.275 --> 31:27.711
Special Agent
Bishop and McGee.

31:27.755 --> 31:29.322
We have a couple
questions

31:29.365 --> 31:31.063
about your former
contractor, Daniel Mulgrew.

31:31.106 --> 31:32.455
Is this gonna take long?

31:32.499 --> 31:35.197
I was trying to duck out
to catch the Caps play.

31:35.241 --> 31:36.503
I-I never miss a game.

31:36.546 --> 31:38.070
No, no, no, we'll...
we'll be quick.

31:38.113 --> 31:39.810
Uh, you were his
access manager?That's right.

31:39.854 --> 31:41.290
You usually
hire people

31:41.334 --> 31:42.378
with criminal records?

31:42.422 --> 31:43.858
You're aware he had priors?

31:43.902 --> 31:45.077
Are-are you kidding?

31:45.120 --> 31:46.861
That's why we hired him.

31:46.905 --> 31:49.864
We often employ hackers
to find flaws in our systems.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.866
Why did Daniel Mulgrew
stop working here?

31:51.910 --> 31:54.173
Uh, have you ever heard
of LOVEINT?

31:54.216 --> 31:56.088
No.It's when people

31:56.131 --> 31:58.438
in intelligence
illegally use surveillance

31:58.481 --> 32:00.005
to spy on love interests.

32:00.048 --> 32:01.310
And it was coined

32:01.354 --> 32:02.703
here at the NSA.Unfortunately.

32:02.746 --> 32:05.358
So, was Mulgrew
guilty of that?

32:05.401 --> 32:07.316
There were multiple
accusations.

32:07.360 --> 32:10.189
Taking cameras
to spy on female coworkers.

32:10.232 --> 32:12.191
I mean, really creepy stuff.

32:12.234 --> 32:14.367
Well, we never saw that
on his rap sheet.

32:14.410 --> 32:15.977
We never had enough
to charge him.

32:16.021 --> 32:17.413
It got so toxic
around here,

32:17.457 --> 32:19.763
I had to let him go.
Haven't heard from him since.

32:19.807 --> 32:21.200
Do you have an internal report
we could read?

32:21.243 --> 32:24.203
Yeah, of course. I'll send it
over. You got a card?

32:24.246 --> 32:26.161
Yeah, in fact, I do.[cell phone vibrates]

32:26.205 --> 32:27.380
Kasie, hey.

32:27.423 --> 32:28.511
Are you still at the NSA?

32:28.555 --> 32:29.991
Uh, I am. What's up?Okay. Thanks.

32:30.035 --> 32:32.124
Thank you.KASIE: I was able
to trace the e-mails

32:32.167 --> 32:33.516
between Mulgrew and his boss.

32:33.560 --> 32:35.214
It wasn't easy.
They were blocked with

32:35.257 --> 32:37.956
the mother of all encryptions.
Want to know why?

32:37.999 --> 32:40.741
Because the e-mails
came from the NSA.

32:40.784 --> 32:43.309
Some guy named Patrick Norian.

32:43.352 --> 32:46.660
You don't say?
Mr. Norian.

32:51.404 --> 32:54.668
Blackmail?
What-what are you talking about?

32:54.711 --> 32:56.409
Found your e-mails.

32:56.452 --> 32:57.932
What e-mails?

32:59.020 --> 33:00.456
The ones you sent Mulgrew,

33:00.500 --> 33:03.024
where you blackmailed him
into working for you.

33:03.068 --> 33:04.460
These don't prove anything.

33:04.504 --> 33:07.028
Someone could've easily
hacked into my computer.

33:07.072 --> 33:09.291
Yeah. Who?

33:09.335 --> 33:10.597
I work ten feet away from

33:10.640 --> 33:12.338
the best hackers in the world,
take your pick--

33:12.381 --> 33:15.123
it could be any one of them.How's Gibbs doing?

33:15.167 --> 33:17.125
Still circling,
but getting close.

33:17.169 --> 33:18.474
You think Norian's our guy?

33:18.518 --> 33:20.650
Can't keep his hands still,
highly agitated.

33:20.694 --> 33:22.348
He's definitely
hiding something.

33:22.391 --> 33:25.786
Th... This is crazy.
Y-You can't hold me.

33:25.829 --> 33:27.092
You can't.

33:27.135 --> 33:29.137
You like, uh, sports?

33:29.181 --> 33:30.312
What?You have a
very impressive

33:30.356 --> 33:32.358
collection
of signed baseball bats.

33:32.401 --> 33:34.142
You've been in my house?

33:34.186 --> 33:37.363
Shaw was murdered
with a wooden object...

33:37.406 --> 33:38.929
like a baseball bat.

33:38.973 --> 33:41.149
W-W-Wait a minute--
murdered?

33:41.193 --> 33:43.369
Yeah, he figured out
who you were,

33:43.412 --> 33:44.892
and you killed him
two nights ago.

33:44.935 --> 33:46.502
Hold on, I didn't kill anyone.

33:46.546 --> 33:48.765
Then you killed Mulgrew
to cover your tracks.

33:48.809 --> 33:52.378
Slow, slow, slow down. I-I...
You're getting this

33:52.421 --> 33:54.945
all wrong.Help me get it right.

33:54.989 --> 33:57.426
Okay, look...

33:57.470 --> 33:59.428
when Mulgrew was at NSA,

33:59.472 --> 34:02.388
I caught him spying
on his colleagues.

34:02.431 --> 34:03.606
I had video proof,

34:03.650 --> 34:06.740
and I could've
gone to the police.

34:06.783 --> 34:08.524
No, you decided to make a buck.

34:09.656 --> 34:12.093
And you forced Mulgrew
to spy for you.

34:12.137 --> 34:13.268
NORIAN:
Yes.

34:13.312 --> 34:15.444
Yes, I used Mulgrew
to blackmail people,

34:15.488 --> 34:17.838
but I never killed anyone,
and I can prove it.

34:17.881 --> 34:19.666
You say this guy
was killed two nights ago?

34:19.709 --> 34:21.276
I was at
the away game

34:21.320 --> 34:22.799
for the Caps in Arizona,

34:22.843 --> 34:25.367
2,000 miles away.

34:35.551 --> 34:38.337
Hey. Norian's alibi
checks out.

34:38.380 --> 34:40.295
He was in Arizona
both nights

34:40.339 --> 34:42.515
Shaw and Mulgrew
were killed.

34:42.558 --> 34:44.691
Well, he did say
he never misses a game.

34:44.734 --> 34:46.954
Let me get this straight--
we got our blackmailer,

34:46.997 --> 34:48.521
but not our killer?Yup.

34:48.564 --> 34:50.871
Which means our whole theory
on who killed Shaw is wrong.

34:50.914 --> 34:52.394
Yup.Gibbs must be pissed.

34:52.438 --> 34:53.961
GIBBS:
He is.

34:54.004 --> 34:56.529
Start at the beginning.
Go back to the motel

34:56.572 --> 34:59.880
and re-interview the owner.
Hell, go back to the farm

34:59.923 --> 35:01.882
and re-interview the pigs
if you have to.[phone rings]

35:01.925 --> 35:03.753
Okay, uh, hey, Gibbs...Yes?

35:03.797 --> 35:05.320
...I was thinking,
we know Shaw

35:05.364 --> 35:06.843
kept things from his wife,

35:06.887 --> 35:08.149
so maybe he has other secrets

35:08.193 --> 35:09.368
that we don't know about.No.

35:09.411 --> 35:11.196
This case has always
been about watching.

35:11.239 --> 35:13.763
Shaw saw something
that got himself killed.

35:13.807 --> 35:15.635
Yeah, but the question is...

35:15.678 --> 35:17.202
what?

35:17.245 --> 35:19.726
Boss, I got Bagram Air Base
on the phone.

35:19.769 --> 35:22.598
The Marine that Shaw called
on the day he was killed

35:22.642 --> 35:25.166
is finally back on base.
I can patch him through to MTAC.

35:26.472 --> 35:27.603
Patch him in.

35:29.214 --> 35:30.911
Aaron is dead?

35:34.349 --> 35:37.918
We served together in EUCOM
doing intelligence.

35:37.961 --> 35:40.355
I just spoke with him
a few days ago.About what?

35:40.399 --> 35:42.357
He asked me to run
facial recognition on someone.

35:42.401 --> 35:44.533
Why did he ask you
and not someone on his base?

35:44.577 --> 35:47.493
He said it was sensitive.
Needed someone he could trust.

35:47.536 --> 35:50.713
He sent me a video.[typing]

35:50.757 --> 35:52.628
Here, take a look.

35:52.672 --> 35:55.370
That background
look familiar to you?

35:55.414 --> 35:57.024
Monarch Motel.

35:57.067 --> 36:00.070
That's got to be the woman that
was with Congressman Riley.

36:01.985 --> 36:04.205
Did you identify the woman?Yes, sir.

36:04.249 --> 36:05.554
And I gave the results to Aaron.

36:05.598 --> 36:07.339
That was the last time
I spoke to him.

36:07.382 --> 36:09.471
Who is she?She goes by several
different aliases,

36:09.515 --> 36:11.169
but her real name
is Marinka Bazarov.

36:11.212 --> 36:12.213
Russian?

36:12.257 --> 36:14.563
Yes, sir. Russian spy.

36:16.696 --> 36:19.351
VANCE:
Espionage?

36:19.394 --> 36:22.441
We think that Congressman Riley
was targeted by a Russian spy.

36:22.484 --> 36:24.269
Marinka Bazarov.

36:24.312 --> 36:25.748
Born in Volgograd
in 1989,

36:25.792 --> 36:29.274
FSB trained, wanted in several
countries for espionage.

36:30.666 --> 36:32.451
GIBBS:
She seduced Riley.

36:32.494 --> 36:35.541
Stole classified information
from right underneath his nose.

36:35.584 --> 36:37.630
Blackmailers thought it was
just another politician

36:37.673 --> 36:39.153
having an affair.

36:39.197 --> 36:40.937
How does Shaw
fit into all of this?

36:40.981 --> 36:42.939
We know Shaw learned
she was a spy.

36:42.983 --> 36:44.637
If he confronted her...

36:44.680 --> 36:47.335
I'm starting to think we need
to talk to Ms. Bazarov.

36:47.379 --> 36:49.685
Well, TSA just picked her up
at Dulles. She was waiting

36:49.729 --> 36:51.905
to board a flight to Moscow.
They're bringing her in now.

37:02.655 --> 37:03.873
Has she talked?

37:03.917 --> 37:05.701
She's refusing to speak
until someone

37:05.745 --> 37:07.616
from the Russian Embassy
gets here.

37:07.660 --> 37:10.228
For someone in the hot seat,
she's as cool as a cucumber.

37:10.271 --> 37:11.620
It's pretty impressive,
actually.

37:11.664 --> 37:13.405
It's not her
first interrogation.

37:15.885 --> 37:17.496
Is she smiling?

37:17.539 --> 37:19.585
Well, whatever you're gonna do,
you better do it quick.

37:19.628 --> 37:21.021
Once word
gets around

37:21.064 --> 37:23.415
that we've got a Russian spy
in the building...

37:23.458 --> 37:25.504
Every agency in town's
gonna want a piece of her.

37:25.547 --> 37:28.594
Especially when they find out
what she had in her bag.

37:28.637 --> 37:30.552
I found a flash drive
hidden in the false bottom

37:30.596 --> 37:31.901
of this
deodorant stick.

37:31.945 --> 37:33.251
What was on it?

37:33.294 --> 37:35.253
All sorts of classified info:

37:35.296 --> 37:37.298
U.S. arms deals, trade memos,

37:37.342 --> 37:39.605
info about our
satellite systems.

37:39.648 --> 37:41.476
Bazarov was trying to smuggle it
out of the country.

37:41.520 --> 37:44.697
And that's not all
we found on the flash drive.

37:48.918 --> 37:50.572
They ready for me, Karen?

37:50.616 --> 37:52.139
You making
an announcement?

37:53.532 --> 37:55.490
Agents Gibbs and Bishop.

37:55.534 --> 37:56.665
Yeah.

37:56.709 --> 37:58.711
I was, uh,
just about to come clean

37:58.754 --> 38:00.887
about my little slipup
at the motel.

38:01.888 --> 38:03.411
Maybe the voters can forgive me

38:03.455 --> 38:05.674
and I can stay in office,
do some good.

38:05.718 --> 38:07.459
[chuckles] That, uh,
that re-election thing,

38:07.502 --> 38:08.808
that's not gonna happen.

38:08.851 --> 38:10.636
Excuse me?

38:10.679 --> 38:12.464
Yeah, we picked up
your Russian girlfriend

38:12.507 --> 38:14.335
and found her flash drive

38:14.379 --> 38:15.684
with your fingerprints
all over it.

38:15.728 --> 38:17.207
BISHOP:
You weren't seduced by Bazarov,

38:17.251 --> 38:18.426
you were working with her,

38:18.470 --> 38:20.472
trading government secrets
for sex.

38:20.515 --> 38:22.517
Yeah, that's what was on
the blackmail tape.

38:22.561 --> 38:24.084
Not adultery.

38:25.433 --> 38:26.652
Treason.

38:26.695 --> 38:28.567
Are you serious?

38:28.610 --> 38:30.220
This is insane.

38:30.264 --> 38:31.787
You were being blackmailed,

38:31.831 --> 38:34.268
so you had your buddy
look into who it was,

38:34.312 --> 38:35.661
but he also found out

38:35.704 --> 38:38.272
that you were selling intel
to the Russians.

38:38.316 --> 38:40.535
So you killed him.And then you pinned it
on Mulgrew,

38:40.579 --> 38:42.929
who you also killed,
just to be safe.

38:42.972 --> 38:44.496
I've sat through this
long enough.

38:44.539 --> 38:45.888
Karen!

38:51.633 --> 38:53.853
Have Kasie compare these
with the ones

38:53.896 --> 38:55.550
we found in Shaw's head.

38:55.594 --> 38:57.465
While I'm at it,
I'll take an imprint

38:57.509 --> 39:00.294
of your tires. See if they match
the tracks from the farm.

39:05.865 --> 39:09.042
I only wanted Aaron
to find who was blackmailing me.

39:09.085 --> 39:11.610
I never thought
he'd track down Marinka.

39:11.653 --> 39:13.916
You're not gonna
parade me out there

39:13.960 --> 39:15.265
in front of everyone, are you?

39:15.309 --> 39:17.616
I'm a congressman.
Give me a little dignity.

39:17.659 --> 39:19.966
Yeah? Like you
gave your friend?

39:20.009 --> 39:22.708
[all clamoring]

39:33.022 --> 39:35.808
Hey, you're still here.

39:35.851 --> 39:37.897
Packing up.

39:50.910 --> 39:52.302
Hey.

39:52.346 --> 39:54.304
So...

39:54.348 --> 39:56.176
are we gonna continue
this awkward thing,

39:56.219 --> 39:58.004
or can we go back
to being friends?

39:58.047 --> 40:00.006
You're right.

40:00.049 --> 40:02.008
I'm sorry.

40:02.051 --> 40:03.836
Just, when I saw you
with Richard,

40:03.879 --> 40:06.969
I got a little, um...

40:07.013 --> 40:09.407
Overprotective?

40:09.450 --> 40:11.278
Overprotective, yeah.

40:11.321 --> 40:13.628
Hm.

40:13.672 --> 40:15.674
I mean...

40:15.717 --> 40:17.676
you're like a sister to me.

40:17.719 --> 40:20.026
Right, of course.

40:20.069 --> 40:22.463
Well, uh, Richard
went back to Pendleton,

40:22.507 --> 40:24.465
so I won't be seeing him
any time soon,

40:24.509 --> 40:26.249
if it makes you feel any better.

40:26.293 --> 40:29.252
Hm. Well, I won't be seeing
Elena anymore.

40:30.253 --> 40:32.299
She dumped me.No.

40:32.342 --> 40:34.954
I'm sorry.
What happened?

40:36.390 --> 40:38.131
It's complicated.

40:38.174 --> 40:40.046
Do you want to talk about it?

40:40.089 --> 40:40.916
Ah, I'm good.

40:40.960 --> 40:42.657
Okay.

40:42.701 --> 40:44.485
Well, let me cheer you up.

40:44.529 --> 40:46.139
Buy you a burger?
My treat.

40:46.182 --> 40:48.881
No bacon burger.
I'm gonna take a break on pork.

40:48.924 --> 40:51.666
That is a good call.

40:53.712 --> 40:56.018
Hey, uh, so...

40:56.062 --> 40:58.238
did you see Gibbs
come back to the office?

40:58.281 --> 41:00.109
I think he ducked early.

41:00.153 --> 41:02.285
He's been acting
strange lately.

41:02.329 --> 41:05.027
I know. I wonder
what's going on with him.

41:05.071 --> 41:08.335
GIBBS:
Not too much, just a little.

41:08.378 --> 41:11.164
Little of this stuff
goes a long way.

41:11.207 --> 41:12.557
Can I light it now?

41:12.600 --> 41:15.342
Yeah.
Now, what do you remember?

41:15.385 --> 41:18.127
Strike it away.Strike the match
away from you.

41:18.171 --> 41:21.914
Don't burn the house down.

41:33.273 --> 41:36.015
That's so awesome.[chuckles] Yeah, it is.

41:36.058 --> 41:37.669
Looks just like
the one in Bombay.

41:37.712 --> 41:39.148
Pompeii, Phineas.

41:39.192 --> 41:41.194
You got to get that
right tomorrow.

41:41.237 --> 41:43.457
P-O-M-P-E-I-I.
Remember that.

41:43.501 --> 41:45.981
I'm gonna have the coolest
project in class.

41:46.025 --> 41:47.983
Yeah, you are.And look,

41:48.027 --> 41:50.029
I even made a dog
frozen in ash.

41:50.072 --> 41:52.466
I remember the dog.

41:52.510 --> 41:53.989
A purple dog.

41:54.033 --> 41:56.383
Mm-hmm.Dig the color.

41:56.426 --> 41:57.515
[phone rings]

41:59.429 --> 42:02.432
Oh. Got to go.
I'm late for dinner.

42:02.476 --> 42:04.609
Okay.

42:04.652 --> 42:07.307
Come on back here tomorrow.
We're gonna clean up this mess.

42:07.350 --> 42:08.961
Let's go.

42:12.181 --> 42:13.313
All right.

42:13.356 --> 42:15.707
Got it?Yeah.

42:15.750 --> 42:18.274
Thanks, Jethro Gibbs.See you tomorrow, kid.
