WEBVTT

00:01.784 --> 00:03.481
- Well, did you try Elisa?

00:03.525 --> 00:06.180
I put her number
in our contact sheet.

00:07.485 --> 00:08.617
Nope, nope.
It's okay.

00:08.660 --> 00:10.097
I'll take care of it.

00:10.140 --> 00:11.620
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:11.663 --> 00:14.188
- [exhales sharply]

00:14.231 --> 00:16.538
- Morning.
- Hey.

00:16.581 --> 00:17.713
- What's with the bagels?

00:17.756 --> 00:19.062
- New guy starts today.

00:19.106 --> 00:20.585
A little tradition I have.

00:20.629 --> 00:22.674
- You already found
a replacement for Ivan?

00:22.718 --> 00:24.676
- Yep.
- A new replacement.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.461
That was fast.
- Didn't feel like it.

00:26.504 --> 00:29.203
I had 38 applications
and half a dozen phone calls

00:29.246 --> 00:31.509
from people putting in
a good word, but it's done.

00:31.553 --> 00:33.207
His name is Ray Cannon,
good guy.

00:33.250 --> 00:36.210
Needs a little seasoning, but
I think you're gonna like him.

00:39.169 --> 00:41.171
Everything all right?
- Yeah.

00:41.215 --> 00:43.173
I kind of have
a situation here.

00:43.217 --> 00:44.827
My daughter threw up at school,
my nanny

00:44.870 --> 00:47.264
is not answering her cell,
and my wife's in court.

00:47.308 --> 00:49.136
You mind if I step out
for a minute?

00:49.179 --> 00:51.181
- No problem.
- I won't take long.

00:51.225 --> 00:53.792
My nanny is probably
just feeding the baby, and--

00:53.836 --> 00:55.098
- Sheryll, it's fine. Go.

00:55.142 --> 00:57.144
I'll save you a pumpernickel
with a schmear.

00:57.187 --> 00:58.710
- Thanks.
I'll be back soon.

00:58.754 --> 01:00.060
- Okay.

01:07.719 --> 01:10.200
- Listen to me.
This is a terrible idea.

01:10.244 --> 01:12.115
He's been in there too long.

01:12.159 --> 01:14.639
Someone's gonna see you.

01:14.683 --> 01:16.163
[indistinct chatter]

01:16.206 --> 01:18.121
- They just left
the restaurant.

01:18.165 --> 01:19.862
- I can't believe
you followed him here.

01:19.905 --> 01:21.690
Please don't do this.

01:21.733 --> 01:22.821
- Just go.
Get out of there.

01:22.865 --> 01:24.519
- I am not stopping.

01:24.562 --> 01:26.738
- You have to.
- You're in control.

01:26.782 --> 01:28.175
- You don't have to do
what he says.

01:28.218 --> 01:29.437
- I said no!

01:31.526 --> 01:33.093
- Can I help you?

01:35.225 --> 01:36.444
- I'm sorry, I...

01:39.621 --> 01:42.145
- Thanks for making the run.
- Sure.

01:42.189 --> 01:44.234
- I'll see you in there, okay?
- Okay.

01:44.278 --> 01:46.367
[eerie music]

01:46.410 --> 01:51.285
â™ª

01:51.328 --> 01:52.677
- Damn weirdo.

02:18.181 --> 02:19.661
- What the hell?

02:29.801 --> 02:32.674
- Marion, no!
No, no, no!

02:32.717 --> 02:33.936
- Aah!

02:33.979 --> 02:35.720
[car horns blaring]

02:35.764 --> 02:39.202
- [wailing]

02:39.246 --> 02:44.903
â™ª

02:45.687 --> 02:46.862
- Kristin.
Welcome.

02:46.905 --> 02:48.820
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, likewise.

02:48.864 --> 02:51.214
- Hey.
Everybody, meet Ray,

02:51.258 --> 02:53.651
the bright future of the FBI.
- Indeed.

02:53.695 --> 02:56.567
- He tell you his story yet?
- I just walked in.

02:56.611 --> 02:59.788
- Wait till you hear this.
Born and raised in New Orleans.

02:59.831 --> 03:01.703
Started with their PD
when he was 19

03:01.746 --> 03:03.270
but smart enough
to go to night school

03:03.313 --> 03:04.662
and get a college degree.

03:04.706 --> 03:06.795
Seven years patrol,
four as a junior detective.

03:06.838 --> 03:08.405
And last year,
graduated Quantico

03:08.449 --> 03:10.494
at the top of his class.

03:10.538 --> 03:12.366
Been chomping at the bit
behind the desk

03:12.409 --> 03:14.846
with Violent Crimes
in Albany ever since.

03:14.890 --> 03:16.500
I leave anything out?

03:16.544 --> 03:17.806
- I play stride piano.

03:17.849 --> 03:21.375
And I won state senior year,
all-district MVP.

03:21.418 --> 03:22.898
- On the badminton team.

03:22.941 --> 03:25.292
- No football.
- Oh, right.

03:25.335 --> 03:26.728
- He's messing with you.
- Yeah, he does that.

03:26.771 --> 03:28.425
- Anyway, the bagels
are gonna have to wait

03:28.469 --> 03:30.253
'cause a case just came in.

03:30.297 --> 03:31.776
- Should we wait for Sheryll?

03:31.820 --> 03:33.517
- She had a personal thing.
We're just gonna go.

03:33.561 --> 03:34.823
- Okay.

03:34.866 --> 03:36.955
- 48 minutes ago,
in Murfreesboro, Tennessee,

03:36.999 --> 03:39.958
unknown subject opens the door
to the local IRS office,

03:40.002 --> 03:43.223
tosses a bomb inside,
and flees the scene.

03:43.266 --> 03:44.920
Deceased victim,
Marion Meeks.

03:44.963 --> 03:46.443
Senior agent.

03:46.487 --> 03:49.359
Married father of two
based out of Nashville.

03:49.403 --> 03:50.752
- What was he doing
in Murfreesboro?

03:50.795 --> 03:51.883
- He had business there.

03:51.927 --> 03:52.884
Just finished breakfast

03:52.928 --> 03:55.365
with this woman,
Martha Danzette.

03:55.409 --> 03:57.715
Works full-time
at the Murfreesboro office.

03:57.759 --> 03:59.804
She's pretty freaked out
because if Meeks hadn't

03:59.848 --> 04:01.632
asked her to run
get office supplies,

04:01.676 --> 04:02.938
she'd be inside too.

04:02.981 --> 04:04.722
Instead, she was
still in her car.

04:04.766 --> 04:05.767
Saw the whole thing.

04:05.810 --> 04:07.377
- Anything
on who we're chasing?

04:07.421 --> 04:09.727
- Video's not helpful,
but according to Martha,

04:09.771 --> 04:11.729
white male,
late 20s, early 30s,

04:11.773 --> 04:13.818
wearing a hat
and some kind of army jacket.

04:13.862 --> 04:16.038
She saw him with a backpack
talking on his phone

04:16.081 --> 04:18.693
in the parking lot
before Meeks went inside.

04:18.736 --> 04:20.608
- Could be a racial thing.
- Mm-hmm.

04:20.651 --> 04:23.393
Or a taxpayer pissed off
with some kind of axe to grind.

04:23.437 --> 04:24.829
- That's what Treasury's
worried about,

04:24.873 --> 04:26.657
that their agents
were targeted.

04:26.701 --> 04:28.746
They've put all offices
on high alert.

04:28.790 --> 04:30.400
- Well, yeah,
a young white male,

04:30.444 --> 04:31.532
rage issues
with the government.

04:31.575 --> 04:33.011
I'd say that's a concern.
- All right.

04:33.055 --> 04:34.665
Jet's waiting.
Let's get to Nashville.

04:34.709 --> 04:36.319
Kristin,
you take Meeks' workplace.

04:36.363 --> 04:37.581
Hana, you've got
the crime scene.

04:37.625 --> 04:39.061
Ray and I will go
and talk to his wife.

04:39.104 --> 04:41.629
- Hey, sorry.
What did I miss?

04:41.672 --> 04:43.544
- We've got a fugitive
in Tennessee.

04:43.587 --> 04:45.023
- Okay.
You're the new guy?

04:45.067 --> 04:46.938
- Ray Cannon.
Nice to meet you.

04:46.982 --> 04:48.940
Nice to meet you.
- Pair up with Kristin.

04:48.984 --> 04:50.638
She'll brief you on the way.
Let's roll.

04:52.379 --> 04:53.597
- He's really
getting straight to it.

04:53.641 --> 04:54.598
- Yeah.

04:54.642 --> 04:56.339
- I knew something was wrong

04:56.383 --> 04:57.775
when he didn't call
this morning.

04:57.819 --> 05:00.082
He always checks in
like clockwork.

05:00.125 --> 05:02.780
- And what was his job?
- Audit specialist.

05:02.824 --> 05:05.000
He spent 15 years
doing personal returns

05:05.043 --> 05:06.958
until I moved him over
to small business

05:07.002 --> 05:09.352
and paycheck protection loans
when the pandemic started.

05:09.396 --> 05:10.788
- Why'd you move him?

05:10.832 --> 05:12.834
- Because it's a lot
more complicated.

05:12.877 --> 05:15.793
And Marion was smart
and thorough.

05:15.837 --> 05:17.882
He's one of the best
I've ever seen, honestly.

05:17.926 --> 05:20.058
- Did he ever interact with any
of the people he was auditing?

05:20.102 --> 05:22.713
- During COVID, it was
mostly by mail or online.

05:22.757 --> 05:23.888
But in the last six months,

05:23.932 --> 05:25.455
he started doing
field audits again.

05:25.499 --> 05:26.456
- Why is that?

05:26.500 --> 05:28.371
- It's harder to lie in person,

05:28.415 --> 05:29.720
especially to Marion.

05:29.764 --> 05:31.635
- Did anyone ever threaten him?

05:31.679 --> 05:32.767
- Lawyers did it every day.

05:32.810 --> 05:34.769
- I mean the people,
the taxpayers.

05:34.812 --> 05:37.641
- Well, I guess it's possible,
but Marion's tough.

05:37.685 --> 05:39.077
He never said anything.

05:39.121 --> 05:41.384
You think someone
he was auditing did this?

05:41.428 --> 05:42.472
- Well, we're not sure yet.

05:42.516 --> 05:43.952
How many open files
did you have?

05:43.995 --> 05:45.823
- At least 500,
maybe more.

05:45.867 --> 05:46.998
- Can you filter those for us?

05:47.042 --> 05:49.087
White males,
age range 25 to 35?

05:49.131 --> 05:51.351
- I'm sure we can.
We'll get you set up.

05:51.394 --> 05:52.830
- Thank you.

05:52.874 --> 05:54.789
- Sorry for your loss.

05:54.832 --> 05:56.573
Can you tell us
about your husband?

05:56.617 --> 05:59.141
- He was a good father,
a good provider.

05:59.184 --> 06:01.404
- Was he active in the church?
- Yes.

06:01.448 --> 06:02.797
He was a deacon for 20 years.

06:02.840 --> 06:04.625
- Did he have any enemies?

06:04.668 --> 06:06.627
Had anyone
threatened him recently?

06:06.670 --> 06:07.889
- Not that I know of.

06:07.932 --> 06:10.674
Marion was a very private man.

06:10.718 --> 06:13.982
Stern is the word people use.

06:14.025 --> 06:17.681
He never talked about his work,
and I didn't ask.

06:17.725 --> 06:19.640
Look, I already
told the police this already.

06:19.683 --> 06:20.945
- I understand.

06:20.989 --> 06:22.469
We're just trying to get
as much information

06:22.512 --> 06:24.514
as we can
so we can find who did this.

06:24.558 --> 06:25.733
- It's not obvious?

06:25.776 --> 06:28.910
A white racist loser
angry at the world?

06:28.953 --> 06:32.043
The country's full of them.

06:32.087 --> 06:35.046
Those are my boys.

06:35.090 --> 06:36.831
I need to go.
- Of course.

06:36.874 --> 06:38.702
You have funeral arrangements
to attend to.

06:38.746 --> 06:40.443
- There's not going
to be any funeral.

06:40.487 --> 06:42.880
Marion's getting cremated.

06:42.924 --> 06:44.534
Hi, babies.

06:46.014 --> 06:48.059
- Something's off.
- Tell me.

06:48.103 --> 06:49.496
- The cremation.

06:49.539 --> 06:51.019
I mean,
Baptist don't usually do that,

06:51.062 --> 06:53.456
especially in the South.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.197
When the rapture comes, how are
you gonna get out of the grave

06:55.240 --> 06:57.460
if you're burnt to ashes?

06:57.504 --> 06:59.027
- You're a church guy?

06:59.070 --> 07:00.724
- Enough to know.

07:00.768 --> 07:02.639
- That kind of makes sense,
though.

07:02.683 --> 07:04.206
Ever see a bomb go off?

07:04.249 --> 07:07.514
- So you close the casket
and you still have the funeral.

07:07.557 --> 07:09.516
Look, I'm telling you.
The services is a big deal.

07:09.559 --> 07:12.170
All right? It's weird.
[phone ringing]

07:12.214 --> 07:13.737
- Hey, Hana.
What's up?

07:13.781 --> 07:15.913
- We found a green
army-style jacket

07:15.957 --> 07:18.176
stuffed in a dumpster three
blocks from the crime scene.

07:18.220 --> 07:19.700
ERT's on the way.

07:19.743 --> 07:20.918
- Any witnesses?

07:20.962 --> 07:22.877
- No, but we got a call
to the tip line.

07:22.920 --> 07:26.446
A cab driver picked up a white
male about a mile from here.

07:26.489 --> 07:28.970
He was acting strange
and talking on his phone.

07:29.013 --> 07:30.101
The cab driver got spooked,

07:30.145 --> 07:31.581
faked car trouble,
and let him out.

07:31.625 --> 07:33.757
He got home, saw the news,
he thinks is our guy.

07:33.801 --> 07:35.759
- What was the drop-off?
- South of here.

07:35.803 --> 07:37.500
The corner
of Church and Butler.

07:37.544 --> 07:39.720
- Call Highway Patrol.
Set a three-mile perimeter.

07:39.763 --> 07:42.157
If he's on foot,
can't have gotten far.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.202
[tense music]

07:44.246 --> 07:45.595
- You have to end this.

07:45.639 --> 07:47.597
Go to the police
and turn yourself in.

07:47.641 --> 07:49.556
- That cab driver
suspected something.

07:49.599 --> 07:50.731
He probably
already called them.

07:50.774 --> 07:52.515
- No, I'm not finished.

07:52.559 --> 07:54.604
- I know you're angry
and I know it hurts,

07:54.648 --> 07:56.824
but this isn't the answer.

07:56.867 --> 07:57.825
We can fix it.

07:57.868 --> 08:01.045
â™ª

08:01.089 --> 08:03.657
We'll tell them he made you
do it and you didn't want to,

08:03.700 --> 08:05.180
and maybe they'll understand.

08:05.223 --> 08:06.747
- I gotta go.

08:08.749 --> 08:09.880
[car unlocks]

08:14.842 --> 08:16.974
[car engine starts]

08:17.018 --> 08:23.590
â™ª

08:23.633 --> 08:26.549
- Hey.
What the hell are you doing?

08:26.593 --> 08:28.072
Get on my truck, psycho!

08:29.683 --> 08:31.554
[grunts]

08:31.598 --> 08:34.601
[straining]

08:45.307 --> 08:46.395
- It's a gun store.

08:46.438 --> 08:47.352
Victim got jumped
in the parking lot.

08:47.396 --> 08:48.571
Truck was stolen.

08:48.615 --> 08:50.355
Had his leg run over too.

08:50.399 --> 08:52.575
- Okay. Is it our guy?
- Must be.

08:52.619 --> 08:54.621
Victim saw him lurking outside
talking on his phone

08:54.664 --> 08:55.970
just like this morning.

08:56.013 --> 08:57.667
Might have some people
helping him too.

08:57.711 --> 08:59.495
- Well, we've got something
that might track with that.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.976
We've got a Leon Cole,
35-year-old white male.

09:02.019 --> 09:03.760
Made two threats
against Meeks last month

09:03.804 --> 09:04.979
while he was being audited.

09:05.022 --> 09:06.633
- What kind of threats?

09:06.676 --> 09:08.025
- "We're gonna blow
all you pricks

09:08.069 --> 09:09.505
to kingdom Come
if you don't back off."

09:09.549 --> 09:10.985
Words to that effect.

09:11.028 --> 09:12.421
- Yeah, I say that tracks.

09:12.464 --> 09:14.118
- He also didn't show up
for work this morning.

09:14.162 --> 09:15.293
- All right,
check it out.

09:15.337 --> 09:17.339
Let me know what you find.

09:17.382 --> 09:20.647
- Manager confirm that he sold
Fred a 9-millimeter Glock

09:20.690 --> 09:22.518
and two boxes of ammo.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.347
The perp never went inside and
there's no cameras in the lot.

09:25.390 --> 09:27.262
You think he did it
for the gun or the truck?

09:27.305 --> 09:28.393
- Maybe both.

09:28.437 --> 09:30.482
Did ATF send
bomb material alerts out

09:30.526 --> 09:31.788
to all the stores around here?
- Yes.

09:31.832 --> 09:33.224
I updated the BOLO

09:33.268 --> 09:35.575
and I contacted them
about a sketch artist.

09:35.618 --> 09:36.750
Maybe the cab driver or Fred

09:36.793 --> 09:38.360
can give us something
to work off?

09:38.403 --> 09:40.405
[phone ringing]

09:40.449 --> 09:42.103
- Hey, Ray.
What's up?

09:42.146 --> 09:44.061
- Hey, I think
we should go see Jayden,

09:44.105 --> 09:45.367
Marion Meeks' oldest son.

09:45.410 --> 09:47.021
- Wait, you think
he's involved in this?

09:47.064 --> 09:49.371
- Probably not,
but I just checked.

09:49.414 --> 09:51.591
And he's got priors
for petty theft and assault

09:51.634 --> 09:53.636
with minor ties
to gang activity.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.159
Jayden might be caught up
in something

09:55.203 --> 09:57.335
his dad paid for with his life.

09:57.379 --> 09:58.336
It's just a hunch.

09:58.380 --> 10:00.382
- Yeah, hunch works right now.

10:00.425 --> 10:01.688
Send us the address,
and we'll meet you there.

10:01.731 --> 10:03.254
- You got it.

10:06.867 --> 10:08.695
- Leon left for work
before I got up.

10:08.738 --> 10:10.653
I ain't talked to him since.

10:10.697 --> 10:11.698
- We were just at his office.

10:11.741 --> 10:14.526
He didn't show up
for work today.

10:14.570 --> 10:15.702
- Okay.

10:15.745 --> 10:17.704
- Well, do you know
where he might be?

10:17.747 --> 10:20.576
- Maybe Darryl's
or a strip bar.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.709
I done called him
ten times today,

10:22.752 --> 10:24.667
but he won't answer.

10:24.711 --> 10:26.321
Is this about the audit?

10:26.364 --> 10:27.627
- Oh, you know about that?

10:27.670 --> 10:30.281
- Hell yeah I know,
'cause it's all bullcrap.

10:30.325 --> 10:32.240
Leon took
that paycheck loan money

10:32.283 --> 10:33.807
so he could pay his boys,
and that's all.

10:33.850 --> 10:35.286
He ain't done nothing wrong.

10:35.330 --> 10:37.593
- Then why'd he threaten
to blow up his auditor twice

10:37.637 --> 10:39.726
in the past month?

10:39.769 --> 10:41.728
- You mean that Black fella
that came in here,

10:41.771 --> 10:44.774
told me sit in the other room
while he ate my coffee cake?

10:44.818 --> 10:46.210
I don't know about that.

10:46.254 --> 10:47.690
If you say so.

10:47.734 --> 10:49.692
[truck approaching]

10:51.738 --> 10:53.609
- White male in a pickup truck.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.132
- That's just Leon.

10:55.176 --> 10:56.656
- Wait here.

10:59.310 --> 11:02.313
- Leon Cole,
can we talk?

11:02.357 --> 11:04.838
Kristin Gaines, FBI.

11:09.146 --> 11:10.626
[car horn blares]
- Hey!

11:15.239 --> 11:16.284
- Hey!

11:16.327 --> 11:18.721
[dramatic music]

11:18.765 --> 11:24.814
â™ª

11:24.858 --> 11:26.598
- Get off me.
- Hands behind your back.

11:26.642 --> 11:29.514
- I didn't do anything.
- Stop resisting.

11:34.694 --> 11:35.782
- Just get inside, sweetie.

11:35.825 --> 11:37.871
It's just some BS.
I'll be right back in.

11:37.914 --> 11:39.133
- Uh-huh.

11:39.176 --> 11:41.352
- [grunts]
I'm sorry.

11:41.396 --> 11:42.832
I'll pay the money back.
I swear.

11:42.876 --> 11:44.660
- This isn't
about the money, moron.

11:44.704 --> 11:48.664
Threatening a government agent
is a federal crime.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.535
- You mean Marion?

11:50.579 --> 11:52.407
I didn't mean it.
It was all talk.

11:52.450 --> 11:53.495
I was pissed, and I--
- All right.

11:53.538 --> 11:55.236
Where have you been
all day, Leon?

11:55.279 --> 11:57.325
- Fishing it Percy Priest Lake.

11:57.368 --> 11:59.893
Check my phone.
I took pictures all day.

11:59.936 --> 12:02.809
What's this about?

12:02.852 --> 12:04.375
- Open it.

12:04.419 --> 12:06.595
- What is this about?

12:06.638 --> 12:09.250
Why am I in these cuffs?
What am I being arrested for?

12:09.293 --> 12:10.338
Am I talking to myself here?

12:10.381 --> 12:11.687
- See when they were taken.

12:11.731 --> 12:15.560
- 7:22, 8:35, 9:16.
- I told you.

12:15.604 --> 12:16.692
I was there all day.
- Check his call history.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.172
- What for?
- Because I wanna know

12:18.215 --> 12:19.826
who you've been talking to.
- I got privacy rights.

12:19.869 --> 12:22.437
- Could you be quiet?
- Could you shut up?

12:25.745 --> 12:27.964
- No outgoing calls.
All incoming.

12:28.008 --> 12:29.661
- Looks like your wife
called you ten times today,

12:29.705 --> 12:30.793
so why didn't you
pick up the phone?

12:30.837 --> 12:32.752
- 'Cause I didn't want to.

12:33.927 --> 12:35.580
She's a royal pain in my ass.

12:35.624 --> 12:37.278
- Oh, that's good.

12:42.631 --> 12:43.806
- This is ridiculous.

12:43.850 --> 12:45.503
You don't know anything
about guns.

12:45.547 --> 12:48.202
- Dad's right.
This is the worst idea ever.

12:48.245 --> 12:49.769
- Can't be that hard.

12:49.812 --> 12:51.379
- It is hard.

12:51.422 --> 12:52.946
What if you
don't load it right?

12:52.989 --> 12:55.252
What if you go to pull the
trigger and nothing happens?

12:55.296 --> 12:56.732
Everyone has guns around here.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.299
What if someone
pulls one on you?

12:58.342 --> 12:59.822
- What if he has one?

12:59.866 --> 13:03.391
- You could
get yourself killed.

13:03.434 --> 13:04.827
- That's why
I'm gonna practice.

13:04.871 --> 13:06.655
- Don't do that!
If you start shooting,

13:06.698 --> 13:08.222
you're gonna make
too much noise.

13:08.265 --> 13:10.659
You'll just attract attention.
- Darla, please.

13:10.702 --> 13:12.661
Don't make this worse.

13:12.704 --> 13:14.881
- Don't worry about it.
- I am gonna worry about it.

13:14.924 --> 13:17.579
You're not thinking straight.
Just--

13:17.622 --> 13:24.020
â™ª

13:24.064 --> 13:25.805
[gunshot]

13:38.426 --> 13:41.255
- Mmm, good call
on the hot chicken sandwich.

13:41.298 --> 13:44.258
- Right?
It's a total Nashville thing.

13:44.301 --> 13:45.955
- And, Boss, how about we
forget the knock and announce,

13:45.999 --> 13:48.349
and I just do this on my own?

13:48.392 --> 13:49.524
- Why?

13:49.567 --> 13:51.918
- I'm just reading the room.

13:51.961 --> 13:53.571
- He kinda has a point.

13:53.615 --> 13:55.660
- Jayden might be more open
if it's just me,

13:55.704 --> 13:58.925
especially if he doesn't know
I'm a fed.

13:58.968 --> 14:00.491
Let's just try it.

14:09.065 --> 14:11.415
Thank you.

14:11.459 --> 14:12.939
- We'll be outside.

14:12.982 --> 14:14.854
Yell if you need us,
youngblood.

14:21.817 --> 14:24.864
[phone chatter]

14:27.692 --> 14:29.433
[knocks at door]

14:29.477 --> 14:31.348
- Hello?

14:31.392 --> 14:32.872
It's maintenance.

14:42.838 --> 14:46.668
Hey, I'm sorry to bother you,
but your manager called.

14:46.711 --> 14:48.539
Said I need
to check on the power.

14:48.583 --> 14:50.498
- Yeah, good.
Come on in.

14:50.541 --> 14:52.979
- All right, cool.

14:53.022 --> 14:55.677
Yeah, these old buildings, man.
[door slams]

14:55.720 --> 14:58.462
The wiring sucks.

14:58.506 --> 15:00.508
You hear anything pop?

15:00.551 --> 15:01.988
You see a flash or something?

15:02.031 --> 15:04.729
- Nah,
everything just went out.

15:04.773 --> 15:07.341
- All right.

15:07.384 --> 15:10.474
What have you been up to today?

15:10.518 --> 15:13.086
- Self-medicating.
- Yeah, I get that.

15:13.129 --> 15:16.132
It's a rough neighborhood.
Gang territory, right?

15:16.176 --> 15:18.700
- I wouldn't know.
I'm a musician.

15:18.743 --> 15:21.572
- Oh, for real?
You go to work today?

15:21.616 --> 15:24.619
- Why?
- I'm just curious, man.

15:24.662 --> 15:26.360
I don't see
no instruments around.

15:26.403 --> 15:29.537
- I'm a DJ,
house and trap and stuff.

15:29.580 --> 15:30.973
Hey, and why are you
in the kitchen?

15:31.017 --> 15:32.888
The fuse box is
by the front door.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.804
- Yeah, yeah.

15:35.847 --> 15:37.632
I saw that.

15:42.028 --> 15:45.466
- That ain't mine, I swear.

15:45.509 --> 15:46.902
- Hey.
Don't do it, Jayden.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.557
Jayden.
Come on, man.

15:49.600 --> 15:52.168
Hey, hey, hey.
Look, FBI, all right?

15:52.212 --> 15:54.475
And I got
two more agents outside.

15:54.518 --> 15:56.433
We need to talk.

15:58.740 --> 16:00.133
- Thanks.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.226
- You letting him go?

16:06.269 --> 16:08.010
- Said he was home all day
till his mom called,

16:08.054 --> 16:09.142
and he's not in a gang.

16:09.185 --> 16:11.448
- What about the
gun? - It's not his.

16:11.492 --> 16:13.015
- It's a parole violation.

16:13.059 --> 16:14.756
- It's registered
to his father,

16:14.799 --> 16:16.279
who, by the way,
was murdered today.

16:16.323 --> 16:18.847
We don't have time for arrest
and paperwork right now.

16:18.890 --> 16:20.762
This job isn't
about street busts.

16:20.805 --> 16:21.981
It's about finding
our fugitive.

16:22.024 --> 16:23.983
You're
in the manhunt business now.

16:24.026 --> 16:27.899
Get your priorities straight,
understand?

16:27.943 --> 16:29.945
- Remy, Forensics got something

16:29.989 --> 16:31.555
on the army jacket
from the trashcan.

16:31.599 --> 16:32.643
They ID'd our unsub.

16:32.687 --> 16:33.688
- What's his name?

16:33.731 --> 16:36.169
- You mean her.
Darla Crais.

16:36.212 --> 16:38.954
She works for the IRS office
in Downtown Nashville.

16:38.998 --> 16:43.002
â™ª

16:48.181 --> 16:51.140
[tense music]

16:51.184 --> 16:58.191
â™ª

17:01.194 --> 17:03.413
- Ms. Westphal,
thanks for meeting after hours.

17:03.457 --> 17:04.632
- Oh, not a problem.

17:04.675 --> 17:06.547
What's so urgent
about seeing Darla's desk?

17:06.590 --> 17:08.244
Does she know
who killed Marion?

17:08.288 --> 17:09.985
- We think she did.

17:10.029 --> 17:13.075
- I thought it was a man.
- Yeah, we did too.

17:17.384 --> 17:19.168
- She called in sick
this morning,

17:19.212 --> 17:20.604
but I didn't think anything
of it.

17:20.648 --> 17:22.084
- What kind of employee is she?

17:22.128 --> 17:24.217
- Reliable and competent,
by the book.

17:24.260 --> 17:26.741
- She have a family?
- She never talks about any.

17:26.784 --> 17:29.309
She just does her job
and goes home every night.

17:29.352 --> 17:30.962
Here.

17:31.006 --> 17:33.269
This is her spot.

17:33.313 --> 17:35.402
- Darla was seen
talking on her cell,

17:35.445 --> 17:37.099
but we haven't been able
to ping it.

17:37.143 --> 17:39.145
Does she any friends
that she's been in contact,

17:39.188 --> 17:40.972
either here at home?

17:41.016 --> 17:43.323
- Home, I don't know about,
but here, no.

17:43.366 --> 17:46.587
She's not social
and keeps to herself.

17:46.630 --> 17:49.242
She eats lunch by herself
at this desk every day.

17:49.285 --> 17:50.678
Darla works support staff

17:50.721 --> 17:52.549
and the returns division
down here.

17:52.593 --> 17:54.638
And Marion was
in the audit section upstairs.

17:54.682 --> 17:57.076
It's possible they didn't
even know each other.

17:57.119 --> 17:58.468
- We're gonna need access
to her desktop

17:58.512 --> 18:00.122
and a copy
of her personnel file.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.384
- Of course.

18:03.169 --> 18:07.086
- Darla owns a 2019 Prius,
but it's not in the garage.

18:07.129 --> 18:09.349
We need to get a BOLO out.

18:09.392 --> 18:11.220
Earth to Ray?

18:11.264 --> 18:13.309
- Yeah, I got it.

18:13.353 --> 18:15.659
- Look, I know you got
your ass chewed out.

18:15.703 --> 18:17.313
Don't take it personally.

18:17.357 --> 18:18.532
Remy's a good boss.

18:18.575 --> 18:20.621
Try and learn from it.

18:20.664 --> 18:22.666
Looks like she had a laptop.

18:22.710 --> 18:25.060
She either took it
or it's over here somewhere.

18:26.627 --> 18:29.282
- You already in the doghouse?

18:29.325 --> 18:31.458
I saw your credentials
this morning.

18:31.501 --> 18:33.590
You got a pretty low badge
number for a new agent.

18:33.634 --> 18:35.505
- Well, that's because
it was my father's.

18:35.549 --> 18:36.680
- He was also in the bureau?

18:36.724 --> 18:38.465
- Yeah, 36 years.

18:38.508 --> 18:40.162
He retired last summer.

18:40.206 --> 18:42.643
He pinned it on me in Quantico
when I graduated.

18:42.686 --> 18:44.079
- I see.

18:45.776 --> 18:47.126
- Wait.

18:48.214 --> 18:49.737
You think
that's why I got this job?

18:49.780 --> 18:52.696
- I didn't say that.
I was just making conversation.

18:52.740 --> 18:55.134
- Felt more like an accusation.

18:55.177 --> 18:57.092
I figured a sister
will help a brother out.

18:57.136 --> 19:00.051
- Hey, I was a cop too
just like you.

19:00.095 --> 19:02.271
Don't be so sensitive.

19:02.315 --> 19:04.491
- Guys, check this out.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.845
- That's hair.

19:10.888 --> 19:12.542
Her hair.

19:12.586 --> 19:14.240
- Chopped it off
to look like a man.

19:17.591 --> 19:18.766
- Ladies.

19:26.426 --> 19:28.079
- That's weird.

19:28.123 --> 19:29.559
Either she likes
to wear men's clothes

19:29.603 --> 19:31.126
or her boyfriend just moved in.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.172
- Yeah, that could be
what's happening.

19:36.653 --> 19:39.395
- Doxepin, Clonidine.

19:39.439 --> 19:42.137
What's this?
- Don't know, but he will.

19:42.181 --> 19:46.533
Jay Safrit MD.
Vanderbilt Psychiatry Group.

19:49.623 --> 19:53.627
- I diagnosed Darla with D.I.D.
four years ago.

19:53.670 --> 19:56.586
Most people know it is
multiple personality disorder.

19:56.630 --> 19:58.893
- Darla has
multiple personalities?

19:58.936 --> 20:00.590
- We call them alters.

20:00.634 --> 20:02.766
Onset in the late 20s
is typical,

20:02.810 --> 20:04.377
but I'm very concerned

20:04.420 --> 20:07.423
because D.I.D. patients
are almost never violent.

20:07.467 --> 20:09.512
- How many alters
does she have?

20:09.556 --> 20:11.862
- For a long time,
it's been two:

20:11.906 --> 20:13.342
Diane and Greg.

20:13.386 --> 20:16.258
When she's on her meds
and coming to therapy,

20:16.302 --> 20:18.434
she can seem
completely in control.

20:18.478 --> 20:21.698
But when she's not, she can't
control when they appear.

20:21.742 --> 20:25.485
She describes it as being
a passenger in her own body.

20:25.528 --> 20:28.401
Here.
This will give you an idea.

20:28.444 --> 20:30.577
This is Darla
presenting as Diane,

20:30.620 --> 20:32.796
a 17-year-old
high school student.

20:33.928 --> 20:36.583
- Mallory thinks
that it's stupid,

20:36.626 --> 20:40.717
but Kim is like,
"You should just run."

20:40.761 --> 20:43.459
- Are you interested
in student government?

20:43.503 --> 20:45.722
- Yeah, for sure.
- Why?

20:47.681 --> 20:50.553
- It'll help me get
into college.

20:50.597 --> 20:52.686
- What about Greg?

20:52.729 --> 20:55.254
- She never becomes him.

20:55.297 --> 20:58.953
He just talks to her a lot.

20:58.996 --> 21:02.522
Here's Darla talking
about Greg.

21:02.565 --> 21:05.438
- He says that
my job is beneath me

21:05.481 --> 21:07.614
and that I'm wasting my life.

21:09.355 --> 21:10.617
"Why don't you find a man?

21:10.660 --> 21:13.272
Why don't you get married
and have kids?"

21:13.315 --> 21:15.186
I like my job.

21:15.230 --> 21:18.755
And I don't need kids
to define me.

21:18.799 --> 21:21.367
- And what do you want, Darla?

21:25.414 --> 21:27.286
- I want him
to leave me alone.

21:27.329 --> 21:28.939
- And so on and so on.

21:28.983 --> 21:31.681
- I noticed in both videos,
she's wearing earbuds.

21:31.725 --> 21:35.206
- When the alters appear,
she'll talk back to them.

21:35.250 --> 21:36.686
She pretends to be on the phone

21:36.730 --> 21:38.427
so people won't think
she's strange.

21:38.471 --> 21:41.343
It's a coping mechanism.

21:41.387 --> 21:43.345
- Would explain
why we can't track the phone.

21:43.389 --> 21:45.347
She doesn't have it on.
- Right.

21:45.391 --> 21:48.219
- You need to know about David.

21:48.263 --> 21:50.700
- Who?
- He's a new alter.

21:50.744 --> 21:52.789
First appeared
about a month ago.

21:52.833 --> 21:55.792
Darla hates him.
So do Diane and Greg.

21:55.836 --> 21:58.012
- The altars know each other?

21:58.055 --> 21:59.753
- In Darla's head, yes.

21:59.796 --> 22:03.757
She'll hear them arguing,
fighting for control of her.

22:03.800 --> 22:07.282
David is mean and aggressive.

22:07.326 --> 22:08.892
Darla calls him the enforcer.

22:08.936 --> 22:10.633
She's afraid of him.

22:10.677 --> 22:11.895
- Let's see the video.

22:11.939 --> 22:13.984
- She wouldn't let me take any.

22:14.028 --> 22:16.378
Something happened
to trigger his emergence,

22:16.422 --> 22:17.988
and Darla wouldn't say what.

22:18.032 --> 22:20.948
And then about ten days ago,
she stopped coming to therapy.

22:20.991 --> 22:23.994
And I'm worried that
David is making her violent,

22:24.038 --> 22:26.475
especially
if she's off her meds.

22:26.519 --> 22:27.911
- What do you think
David wants?

22:27.955 --> 22:30.566
- I don't know.
David's a mystery.

22:30.610 --> 22:32.916
Diane and Greg, I get.

22:32.960 --> 22:37.051
The sister she never had,
the father who never loved her.

22:37.094 --> 22:39.749
- What do you mean "the father
who never loved her"?

22:39.793 --> 22:41.098
Did he abuse her?

22:41.142 --> 22:43.840
- Well, 95% of the time
with D.I.D. patients,

22:43.884 --> 22:45.712
that's the case.

22:45.755 --> 22:49.063
But Darla's trauma
was different.

22:49.106 --> 22:51.065
- What happened to her?

22:51.108 --> 22:54.416
- Darla's parents abandoned her
when she was seven years old.

22:54.460 --> 22:58.681
They were at rest up in
Kentucky and just disappeared.

22:58.725 --> 23:01.075
No explanation.
No goodbye.

23:01.118 --> 23:02.729
No nothing.

23:02.772 --> 23:03.904
- That's awful.
[phone ringing]

23:03.947 --> 23:06.036
Did she go in the system?

23:06.080 --> 23:09.039
- 11 different foster homes
by the time she was 18.

23:09.083 --> 23:10.998
Never went to college,
always lived alone.

23:11.041 --> 23:13.609
And according to Dr. Safrit,
those first two alters emerged

23:13.653 --> 23:15.655
as her way of coping.

23:15.698 --> 23:18.875
- David's a different story.
- He's the key.

23:18.919 --> 23:22.096
If we can figure out what
made him emerge a month ago,

23:22.139 --> 23:23.967
maybe we can predict
what's next.

23:24.011 --> 23:26.361
- Is there anything
in Darla's personnel file?

23:26.405 --> 23:27.667
- I haven't had a chance
to look.

23:27.710 --> 23:29.799
- I did. Nothing
but eight annual reviews,

23:29.843 --> 23:31.148
all of them good.

23:31.192 --> 23:33.977
No mention of any health
or psychiatric issues.

23:34.021 --> 23:35.936
Her boss might not
even know she's sick.

23:35.979 --> 23:38.895
- Remy, Murfreesboro PD
found Darla's Prius

23:38.939 --> 23:40.897
about a half mile
from the IRS office.

23:40.941 --> 23:43.117
The parking attendant said
it's been there for two days.

23:43.160 --> 23:44.510
- All right.
You and Ray with me.

23:44.553 --> 23:46.120
Let's hit it.

23:52.518 --> 23:54.868
- Hey, are you all right?
- Yeah.

23:56.696 --> 23:59.742
I know this is stupid,
but in the old days,

23:59.786 --> 24:01.091
Jess would have
taken me with him

24:01.135 --> 24:03.703
to go see the psychiatrist
this morning.

24:03.746 --> 24:06.445
I feel like
Remy doesn't trust me.

24:06.488 --> 24:07.924
- Come on, Sheryll.
- No, I'm serious.

24:07.968 --> 24:10.057
I feel like he's icing me out.

24:10.100 --> 24:11.493
- Let me ask you something.

24:11.537 --> 24:13.756
How long have you been back?

24:13.800 --> 24:15.410
About a week?

24:15.454 --> 24:16.846
You remember the way
you guys were with me

24:16.890 --> 24:19.370
when I first turned up?

24:19.414 --> 24:20.720
- It wasn't like this.

24:20.763 --> 24:22.809
- Yeah, it kind of was.

24:22.852 --> 24:25.376
You know this stuff takes time.

24:25.420 --> 24:28.075
Just do what you do.

24:33.907 --> 24:36.518
- Darla,
please don't make this worse.

24:36.562 --> 24:37.954
We have to get out of here.

24:37.998 --> 24:39.521
- Wait, is that him?

24:39.565 --> 24:41.001
It's okay.
He didn't see us.

24:41.044 --> 24:42.742
He doesn't know we're here.

24:44.091 --> 24:46.876
- Darla, no,
don't follow him.

24:48.574 --> 24:50.576
- The FBI put your picture
on the news.

24:50.619 --> 24:52.708
You shouldn't be in public.
- Dad's right.

24:52.752 --> 24:54.841
Do you wanna spend
the rest of our lives in jail?

24:54.884 --> 24:57.060
- Just go.
Turn around and walk away

24:57.104 --> 24:58.497
before it's too late.

24:58.540 --> 24:59.846
- He's
in the produce section now.

24:59.889 --> 25:01.108
- Just leave him.

25:01.151 --> 25:02.892
The longer we're here,
the worse it is.

25:02.936 --> 25:04.198
What if
someone recognizes you?

25:04.241 --> 25:06.505
- Excuse me, sir.
Sir.

25:06.548 --> 25:07.549
- See?

25:07.593 --> 25:09.116
- I need to get
some chili flakes.

25:09.159 --> 25:10.465
- Don't look at her.

25:10.509 --> 25:11.901
Just stay calm.

25:11.945 --> 25:14.600
Turn around and walk away.

25:14.643 --> 25:16.079
- There he is again.

25:16.123 --> 25:17.907
- Walk away, Darla.

25:17.951 --> 25:19.082
It's okay.

25:19.126 --> 25:20.780
He still didn't see us.

25:20.823 --> 25:22.433
He just walked right by.

25:22.477 --> 25:23.826
- Darla, no!

25:27.134 --> 25:28.744
- Just let him
leave the store.

25:28.788 --> 25:31.486
Let him take his things and
get in his car and go home.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.749
You don't wanna hurt him.
David does.

25:33.793 --> 25:35.751
- Think
about his wife and kids.

25:35.795 --> 25:37.753
- Darla,
David's making you do this.

25:37.797 --> 25:39.059
- We know you hate him.

25:39.102 --> 25:40.626
- You don't have
to listen to him.

25:40.669 --> 25:42.062
The truck's
right around the corner.

25:42.105 --> 25:44.586
Just get in and drive,
and this can all be over.

25:44.630 --> 25:46.762
- He stopped.
He's coming back this way.

25:46.806 --> 25:49.591
- I'm begging you,
please don't do this.

25:49.635 --> 25:51.027
- I can make it look
like a robbery.

25:51.071 --> 25:53.943
- It won't matter.
Darla, you can still get away.

25:53.987 --> 25:56.119
Maybe Canada, or even Mexico--
- Stop.

25:56.163 --> 25:57.643
- You're not a killer.

25:57.686 --> 26:00.123
David's the killer,
but you have to tell him no.

26:00.167 --> 26:01.995
You can do this.
- Listen to Dad.

26:02.038 --> 26:04.563
We love you.
- Tell him no, Darla.

26:04.606 --> 26:07.043
Turn around and walk away.
- Just leave me alone.

26:07.087 --> 26:11.570
â™ª

26:11.613 --> 26:15.486
- [whistling]

26:15.530 --> 26:17.140
- Hey, Bill.

26:17.184 --> 26:19.752
[gunshots]
- [grunts]

26:19.795 --> 26:20.970
- He's got a gun!

26:21.014 --> 26:22.624
- What? Where?

26:22.668 --> 26:24.278
- At the ATM!

26:24.321 --> 26:26.933
[gunshots]

26:26.976 --> 26:28.021
- Stop!

26:33.461 --> 26:36.507
[indistinct chatter]

26:41.077 --> 26:42.557
- Victim's another IRS Agent?

26:42.601 --> 26:44.167
- Yep.
His name is Bill Anson.

26:44.211 --> 26:46.082
He works in the Chattanooga
office down the street.

26:46.126 --> 26:47.083
His boss just got here.

26:47.127 --> 26:48.694
- What the hell is going on?

26:54.134 --> 26:56.963
Two to the chest
at close range.

26:57.006 --> 26:58.225
We're sure it was Darla?

26:58.268 --> 27:00.662
- The shell casings match
to a 9-millimete.

27:00.706 --> 27:02.272
- Probably
from the Glock she stole.

27:02.316 --> 27:03.491
- Right.

27:03.534 --> 27:04.840
Plus, the store manager
saw her inside.

27:04.884 --> 27:06.494
She was dressed like a man
talking on the phone.

27:06.537 --> 27:08.670
He got a weird vibe.
Saw her outside.

27:08.714 --> 27:11.281
He was here when it happened.
Heard her say, "Hey, Bill."

27:11.325 --> 27:12.369
- So Darla knew him?

27:12.413 --> 27:13.762
- She shot him,
grabbed some cash.

27:13.806 --> 27:15.764
And then another witness
saw her jump into a truck

27:15.808 --> 27:16.765
and head north.

27:16.809 --> 27:18.506
So it's her.

27:18.549 --> 27:20.769
- We need to warn
every IRS office in this state

27:20.813 --> 27:22.162
right now,
and I mean now.

27:22.205 --> 27:24.164
- All right.
Where's Hana and the rookie?

27:24.207 --> 27:25.469
- Ray's canvassing witnesses.

27:25.513 --> 27:27.080
Hanna's looking
at Darla's laptop

27:27.123 --> 27:28.298
we found
in the back of her car.

27:28.342 --> 27:29.560
- We got a connection

27:29.604 --> 27:31.562
between this victim
and Marion Meeks.

27:31.606 --> 27:35.392
- Yeah, they both work for
the IRS and they're both dead.

27:35.436 --> 27:37.177
- They were also good friends.

27:37.220 --> 27:39.701
Anson used to work for Meeks
in the Nashville office

27:39.745 --> 27:41.442
as a junior auditor

27:41.485 --> 27:43.270
until he was transferred here
three weeks ago.

27:43.313 --> 27:44.663
- And why is that?

27:44.706 --> 27:46.273
- His boss said there was
some kind of complaint,

27:46.316 --> 27:47.578
but he was never told
what it was about.

27:47.622 --> 27:50.016
And now, it's marked
as confidential

27:50.059 --> 27:52.366
and redacted
in Anson's employee file.

27:52.409 --> 27:54.020
- "SB"?
Who the hell is that?

27:54.063 --> 27:56.196
- That's Skip Budner,
head of HR in Nashville.

27:56.239 --> 27:58.024
He must have signed off on it.

27:58.067 --> 28:00.591
- Get with the highway patrol
in the county sheriff's office.

28:00.635 --> 28:02.637
Set a perimeter.
Put a bird in the air.

28:02.681 --> 28:04.378
Call in the damn Boy Scouts
if you have to.

28:04.421 --> 28:05.814
I'm sick and tired
of being a step behind.

28:12.342 --> 28:13.604
- You're welcome.

28:16.433 --> 28:20.133
- Because inclusion
includes language.

28:20.176 --> 28:23.049
- Take a break, people.
We need to talk to Skip.

28:23.092 --> 28:25.138
Come on, hurry up.
Everybody out.

28:25.181 --> 28:27.096
Everybody out.
- What's going on?

28:27.140 --> 28:29.708
- This is Agent Scott
and Agent Gaines with the FBI.

28:29.751 --> 28:32.536
They have some questions
for you about Bill Anson.

28:32.580 --> 28:33.668
- Bill doesn't work here
anymore.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.365
- And we wanna know why.

28:35.409 --> 28:37.716
Those are your initials,
correct?

28:37.759 --> 28:39.369
What was his complaint about?
- Uh...

28:39.413 --> 28:41.067
This is confidential.

28:41.110 --> 28:43.112
I'm not sure I can discuss it.

28:43.156 --> 28:44.331
- But Bill's dead, Mr. Butner.

28:44.374 --> 28:46.202
He was shot
an hour and a half ago,

28:46.246 --> 28:49.379
near his office at an ATM
by Darla Crais.

28:49.423 --> 28:50.598
- Oh, my God.

28:50.641 --> 28:52.426
O-oh, my God.

28:52.469 --> 28:53.688
- Tell us what happened.

28:53.732 --> 28:56.256
- [stammers]

28:59.302 --> 29:01.783
- Darla didn't like Bill.

29:01.827 --> 29:03.306
She said he was always coming

29:03.350 --> 29:04.830
around her desk
and bugging her.

29:04.873 --> 29:08.311
About two months ago, she came
to my office very upset.

29:08.355 --> 29:11.140
She had just come back from
a work conference in Orlando,

29:11.184 --> 29:12.838
the one sponsored
by the law firm

29:12.881 --> 29:14.622
where they put everybody up
at the Royal--

29:14.665 --> 29:15.884
- Why was she upset?

29:17.494 --> 29:20.454
- She said she had
a few drinks one night

29:20.497 --> 29:24.501
and found herself in a room
with Bill and Marion Meeks.

29:24.545 --> 29:25.676
She blacked out.

29:25.720 --> 29:26.982
When she woke up
the next morning,

29:27.026 --> 29:30.377
she felt like
she'd been sexually assaulted

29:30.420 --> 29:33.815
by either Bill or Marion,
maybe both.

29:33.859 --> 29:35.295
- For God's sake.

29:35.338 --> 29:37.863
- Did you know about this?
- Hell no.

29:37.906 --> 29:39.603
Why didn't you tell me?

29:39.647 --> 29:41.518
- Because
she withdrew the complaint.

29:41.562 --> 29:43.825
First thing I told her
was go to the police.

29:43.869 --> 29:45.174
"They'll take
your medical history.

29:45.218 --> 29:46.828
They'll have you examined
by a doctor."

29:46.872 --> 29:49.570
As soon as I said that,
she completely backtracked.

29:49.613 --> 29:51.615
Said maybe she was wrong.

29:51.659 --> 29:53.226
It was probably
all in her head.

29:53.269 --> 29:55.228
She didn't wanna pursue it.

29:55.271 --> 29:56.490
- She didn't want them to know.

29:56.533 --> 29:57.883
- No, she didn't
wanna lose her job.

29:57.926 --> 29:59.710
- Know about what?

30:02.191 --> 30:03.497
- Sheryll, you were right.

30:03.540 --> 30:05.586
Darla's work had no idea
she has D.I.D.

30:05.629 --> 30:07.588
- You find out
what the complaint was about?

30:07.631 --> 30:09.590
- Darla claims
she'd been sexually assaulted

30:09.633 --> 30:11.244
at a work conference
two months ago

30:11.287 --> 30:13.463
by either Anson and/or Meeks.

30:13.507 --> 30:15.552
She went straight to HR
but then withdrew the complaint

30:15.596 --> 30:17.772
as soon as she found out
she'd have to see a doctor,

30:17.816 --> 30:20.514
probably afraid they find out
about her condition.

30:20.557 --> 30:22.168
- Well,
that explains Meeks wife.

30:22.211 --> 30:23.343
- How?

30:23.386 --> 30:24.735
- If she knew
what her husband did,

30:24.779 --> 30:26.650
having him cremated would
have been the final straw.

30:26.694 --> 30:29.305
It's a small thing,
but I get it.

30:29.349 --> 30:30.785
- We need to dig
into this assault,

30:30.829 --> 30:32.613
find out
who else knows about it.

30:32.656 --> 30:34.615
How's Hana coming
with Darla's laptop?

30:34.658 --> 30:36.312
- Yeah, she's still working.

30:36.356 --> 30:37.966
- Grid search?
- Yeah, nothing so far.

30:38.010 --> 30:38.967
But we're
putting up checkpoints

30:39.011 --> 30:40.403
in I-24 North and South.

30:40.447 --> 30:41.622
- All right.
We're headed your way.

30:41.665 --> 30:42.710
Let's stay on this.

30:42.753 --> 30:45.321
Darla is out there somewhere.

30:45.365 --> 30:48.455
[tense music]

30:48.498 --> 30:52.502
â™ª

30:52.546 --> 30:54.461
- This is not your fault.

30:54.504 --> 30:56.593
- Darla, listen to me.

30:56.637 --> 30:59.814
You need to know
how much we love you.

30:59.858 --> 31:02.382
- We love you so much.

31:05.646 --> 31:07.735
- It's David.

31:07.778 --> 31:10.781
It's not you.

31:10.825 --> 31:13.262
You are my baby girl.

31:13.306 --> 31:15.656
- And you will always be
my big sister.

31:20.748 --> 31:23.403
And we are so proud of you.

31:23.446 --> 31:25.753
- This is not you, Darla.

31:25.796 --> 31:28.582
We know who you are.

31:28.625 --> 31:31.802
You're good.

31:31.846 --> 31:34.414
- You're so good.

31:34.457 --> 31:40.289
â™ª

31:41.943 --> 31:43.771
- What do you think
of the new guy?

31:43.814 --> 31:45.947
- He's young, green.

31:45.991 --> 31:47.427
- Hey, he's the same age as me.

31:47.470 --> 31:49.298
- Yeah, with none
of the task force experience.

31:49.342 --> 31:52.258
Honestly, I don't know
why Remy would pick him.

31:52.301 --> 31:54.347
- He's his first hire
since he's been here.

31:54.390 --> 31:56.784
Maybe he wants to mold him
in his own image.

31:56.827 --> 31:57.959
- All right.
Thank you.

31:58.003 --> 31:59.961
- Speaking of...

32:00.005 --> 32:01.093
- Talk to me.

32:01.136 --> 32:02.572
- Truck driver saw Darla
in a pickup

32:02.616 --> 32:03.965
at a rest stop
in North Georgia.

32:04.009 --> 32:05.967
Local PD rolled code 7
but couldn't find her.

32:06.011 --> 32:07.360
They're still looking.

32:07.403 --> 32:09.579
- She's tracking south,
but the question is why.

32:09.623 --> 32:11.277
Hana, anything?
- I'm getting close.

32:11.320 --> 32:12.626
I'm trying to get
into her emails.

32:12.669 --> 32:14.671
- Okay, let's think about this
for a second.

32:14.715 --> 32:16.804
Darla was assaulted
two months ago.

32:16.847 --> 32:20.721
This alter, David, appears
pretty quick after that.

32:20.764 --> 32:23.680
The enforcer.
Why does she call him that?

32:23.724 --> 32:24.986
- Well, she probably
wanted revenge.

32:25.030 --> 32:27.554
And if she was too scared
or too weak to act...

32:27.597 --> 32:28.990
- Her alter could have emerged
to do it for her.

32:29.034 --> 32:30.818
- Right,
keeps her detached,

32:30.861 --> 32:32.994
almost as though
she has no responsibility.

32:33.038 --> 32:34.953
- That's good,
but David was around

32:34.996 --> 32:36.955
for at least three weeks
before anything happened.

32:36.998 --> 32:39.000
What made Darla so violent?

32:39.044 --> 32:41.742
- Maybe she saw Anson again
or Meeks.

32:41.785 --> 32:43.874
- I can see that being a
trigger if she's off her meds.

32:43.918 --> 32:45.528
She's not going to therapy.

32:45.572 --> 32:47.878
- Guys, I know what it is.
She's pregnant.

32:47.922 --> 32:50.664
Four days ago, she contacted
a woman's clinic in Atlanta.

32:50.707 --> 32:53.101
She made an appointment
for an abortion that afternoon.

32:53.145 --> 32:55.582
- Why Georgia?
- No idea.

32:58.715 --> 33:00.369
- Darla
is nine weeks pregnant.

33:00.413 --> 33:02.676
She told me that she had
been sexually assaulted

33:02.719 --> 33:04.330
and couldn't get help
in Tennessee

33:04.373 --> 33:07.420
because they have no exception
for rape.

33:07.463 --> 33:09.509
So she came here to see us.

33:09.552 --> 33:11.641
- Did you do the procedure?
- No.

33:11.685 --> 33:13.904
We do have an exception
for rape in Georgia,

33:13.948 --> 33:16.037
but you're required
to bring a copy

33:16.081 --> 33:17.604
of the police report
you filed.

33:17.647 --> 33:19.910
And she didn't have one.

33:19.954 --> 33:22.043
- How'd she react?
- Well, how do you think?

33:22.087 --> 33:24.045
She was raped
and nobody would help her.

33:24.089 --> 33:26.047
- She said the assault
happened in Florida,

33:26.091 --> 33:28.354
and it was too late
to get a police report.

33:28.397 --> 33:31.531
And she just wanted it out.

33:31.574 --> 33:35.448
She even demanded we give her
mifepristone and misoprostol

33:35.491 --> 33:37.015
so she could go home
and do it herself.

33:37.058 --> 33:38.712
- That's
the abortion pill, right?

33:38.755 --> 33:40.061
- We don't call it that,
but yes.

33:40.105 --> 33:42.063
I told her
that it wasn't possible

33:42.107 --> 33:43.934
without
a police report either.

33:43.978 --> 33:46.067
She got even more upset,
and she left.

33:46.111 --> 33:48.069
And she hasn't come back.

33:48.113 --> 33:50.593
- Call Atlanta PD?
- Yeah, go.

33:50.637 --> 33:52.030
Mary, you have security there?

33:52.073 --> 33:53.988
- They always
keep a guard outside. Why?

33:54.032 --> 33:55.946
- Darla's a fugitive
wanted for murder,

33:55.990 --> 33:57.644
and we think
she's in Georgia right now.

33:57.687 --> 33:59.080
I'm concerned
you could be a target.

33:59.124 --> 34:00.473
- Seriously?

34:00.516 --> 34:02.562
Usually, it's the protesters
we worry about,

34:02.605 --> 34:04.390
not the patient.
- Mary, listen to me.

34:04.433 --> 34:06.174
I want you to round up
all the patients and employees

34:06.218 --> 34:07.567
and lock your doors.

34:07.610 --> 34:09.743
It's just a precaution, but--
[gunshots]

34:09.786 --> 34:10.918
- What was that?

34:10.961 --> 34:12.615
[screaming]

34:12.659 --> 34:15.488
- Mary?
- Oh, my God.

34:15.531 --> 34:17.011
- Mary, can you hear me?

34:17.055 --> 34:18.665
Mary?

34:19.709 --> 34:20.884
Mary?

34:24.714 --> 34:28.501
[helicopter whirring]

34:33.245 --> 34:35.203
- Agent Scott,
I'm Agent Neil.

34:35.247 --> 34:36.552
We've got
the perimeter secured.

34:36.596 --> 34:38.337
- What happened?
- Security wouldn't let her

34:38.380 --> 34:40.382
inside without an appointment.
They argued.

34:40.426 --> 34:42.210
She pulled a pistol
and fired twice.

34:42.254 --> 34:43.298
Thankfully missed,

34:43.342 --> 34:44.343
but she managed
to get inside

34:44.386 --> 34:45.605
and holed up in an exam room.

34:45.648 --> 34:47.215
- Any hostages?
- One female.

34:47.259 --> 34:48.216
The director of the clinic.

34:48.260 --> 34:50.044
- Mary Nash.
- That's her.

34:50.088 --> 34:51.567
It's been quiet for 68 minutes.

34:51.611 --> 34:53.700
But there's a window
around back, second floor.

34:53.743 --> 34:54.962
And she knows we're here.

34:55.005 --> 34:56.094
- You make contact?
- No.

34:56.137 --> 34:57.573
I was told to wait for you.

34:57.617 --> 35:00.620
[indistinct chatter]

35:02.404 --> 35:05.320
- Around back.
Eyes and ears.

35:05.364 --> 35:07.017
You're qualified on that thing?

35:07.061 --> 35:08.541
- Yes, sir.

35:08.584 --> 35:11.457
[tense music]

35:11.500 --> 35:18.116
â™ª

35:21.771 --> 35:23.208
- In position.

35:32.260 --> 35:34.480
- What are you seeing, Kristin?

35:34.523 --> 35:36.308
- Darla's at your 2:00.

35:36.351 --> 35:40.007
I can hardly see her, but
I think she's on the exam bed.

35:40.050 --> 35:41.574
Mary's at your 12:00.

35:41.617 --> 35:43.315
She's crouched on the floor.

35:43.358 --> 35:45.447
No visible injuries.

35:45.491 --> 35:50.191
- Darla, this is Agent Scott
with the FBI.

35:50.235 --> 35:51.540
- Go away.

35:51.584 --> 35:54.021
- We just wanna talk, okay?

35:54.064 --> 35:55.457
Let's figure out a way
to end this

35:55.501 --> 35:57.590
without anyone else
getting hurt.

35:58.808 --> 36:03.552
- I said go away,
or I will kill this bitch.

36:03.596 --> 36:04.771
[gunshot]

36:10.124 --> 36:11.299
- Are you all right?

36:11.343 --> 36:13.214
- Yeah, all good.

36:13.258 --> 36:19.307
â™ª

36:19.351 --> 36:22.528
Darla, I know it wasn't you
that fired that shot.

36:24.138 --> 36:27.359
It was David, right?

36:27.402 --> 36:30.666
He's the one
who killed those men.

36:30.710 --> 36:33.408
He's the one
making you do this now.

36:33.452 --> 36:36.237
- I told you
to go away, please.

36:36.281 --> 36:39.109
- You know what?
I don't like David either.

36:40.763 --> 36:44.376
I know Greg and Diane
feel that way too.

36:46.204 --> 36:48.597
Talk to me.

36:54.690 --> 36:59.347
- I'm tired of everything.

36:59.391 --> 37:01.219
- Tell me what you want.

37:01.262 --> 37:03.351
- I want it out.

37:03.395 --> 37:04.570
I just--

37:04.613 --> 37:09.444
I just want it out of me,
please.

37:09.488 --> 37:11.272
- We can talk about that

37:11.316 --> 37:15.102
if put the gun down
and let Mary go.

37:15.145 --> 37:17.191
You don't wanna hurt her.

37:17.235 --> 37:18.801
She's a good person.

37:20.455 --> 37:22.544
Don't let David
push you around.

37:22.588 --> 37:26.461
- He never leaves me alone.

37:26.505 --> 37:28.550
None of them do.

37:28.594 --> 37:30.726
I can't take it anymore.

37:30.770 --> 37:32.467
- I know.

37:32.511 --> 37:33.773
I know it's hard.

37:33.816 --> 37:35.775
- Why--

37:35.818 --> 37:40.432
why won't they
just leave me alone?

37:43.391 --> 37:44.784
- I got your meds.

37:44.827 --> 37:48.788
If you come out,
I can give him some.

37:48.831 --> 37:52.531
And we can even get
Dr. Safrit on the phone.

37:52.574 --> 37:55.751
What do you say?

37:55.795 --> 37:58.319
You're with me Darla?

37:58.363 --> 38:05.239
â™ª

38:15.902 --> 38:18.861
- [groaning]

38:18.905 --> 38:21.342
- [whimpering]

38:23.736 --> 38:25.128
[clatters]

38:25.172 --> 38:27.130
- [labored breathing]

38:27.174 --> 38:28.654
- What's happening?

38:28.697 --> 38:32.788
- Darla is not moving, but
Mary's crawling towards you.

38:32.832 --> 38:34.747
She's coming to the door.

38:34.790 --> 38:36.357
She's opening the door, Remy.

38:36.401 --> 38:38.316
- Move!
- Cover her!

38:38.359 --> 38:39.491
- I got you.

38:39.534 --> 38:46.585
â™ª

38:52.460 --> 38:54.244
- Gun! Hey!

38:54.288 --> 38:58.771
â™ª

38:58.814 --> 39:01.295
- Call the paramedics.
She's bleeding out.

39:01.339 --> 39:02.731
Get them in here!

39:05.473 --> 39:06.909
- Nice job.

39:06.953 --> 39:09.390
That was a damn
fast reaction, Ray.

39:09.434 --> 39:10.913
You saved her life.

39:10.957 --> 39:13.220
- Is she gonna make it?
- That's what they're saying.

39:13.263 --> 39:14.526
Go make sure I'm right.

39:14.569 --> 39:16.441
- See you soon.

39:16.484 --> 39:18.791
That was Barnes.
She says congrats.

39:18.834 --> 39:20.532
She and Hana are gonna meet us
at the airport.

39:20.575 --> 39:21.837
- Good.

39:23.448 --> 39:25.406
- Is everything good
with you Barnes?

39:25.450 --> 39:26.799
- Yeah, why?

39:26.842 --> 39:29.236
- Sounds like
you're being tough on her,

39:29.279 --> 39:30.542
icing her out maybe.

39:30.585 --> 39:32.413
And if you're testing her,
you know--

39:32.457 --> 39:34.850
- I'm not icing her out.
I'm just doing my job.

39:34.894 --> 39:36.286
When I'm working,
I'm working.

39:36.330 --> 39:39.246
When things get hectic,
I do what I do.

39:39.289 --> 39:41.727
- She's a good agent.

39:41.770 --> 39:43.250
- Yeah, she is.

39:44.556 --> 39:45.644
- Tell her.

39:45.687 --> 39:48.734
[indistinct chatter]

40:03.923 --> 40:05.446
- We're all headed down
to the Crown Room

40:05.490 --> 40:06.969
for Ray's buy-in
if you wanna come.

40:07.013 --> 40:09.929
- No, I can't.
I gotta get home to the kids.

40:12.322 --> 40:13.498
- Okay.

40:18.938 --> 40:20.418
[sighs]

40:23.072 --> 40:24.465
Sheryll.

40:26.380 --> 40:28.600
What's going on?

40:28.643 --> 40:30.732
Let's clear the air.

40:30.776 --> 40:32.473
- You really wanna know?

40:32.517 --> 40:33.779
- I do.

40:38.348 --> 40:41.961
- I've been doing this
for 10 years.

40:42.004 --> 40:43.571
I got more experienced
on fugitives

40:43.615 --> 40:44.746
than anybody else in the team.

40:44.790 --> 40:46.661
And it feels like
I'm starting fresh,

40:46.705 --> 40:49.664
like I got to prove myself
all over again.

40:50.752 --> 40:52.580
- Is this about Jess?

40:52.624 --> 40:55.365
- We had a shorthand.
We understood each other.

40:55.409 --> 40:57.498
He would never have brought
somebody new on the team

40:57.542 --> 40:59.457
without talking to me
about it first.

40:59.500 --> 41:01.589
- That's what you're mad about?
- I'm not mad.

41:01.633 --> 41:03.809
I'm frustrated.

41:03.852 --> 41:06.855
I feel like you don't see me.

41:06.899 --> 41:09.467
I worked my ass off
on this case,

41:09.510 --> 41:11.338
and you didn't even bring me
to the takedown.

41:11.381 --> 41:12.861
- There were three seats
on the chopper.

41:12.905 --> 41:14.428
I made the decision
in the moment.

41:14.472 --> 41:15.690
- So you brought
the rookie instead?

41:15.734 --> 41:18.388
- I needed to find out
what he was made of,

41:18.432 --> 41:19.520
if I can trust him.

41:19.564 --> 41:21.479
- And I need the same thing
from you.

41:21.522 --> 41:23.568
It's a two-way street, Remy.

41:26.658 --> 41:29.661
Look, I know I got
a family and kid issues

41:29.704 --> 41:31.489
to deal with sometimes,
but that does not mean

41:31.532 --> 41:34.970
I am not 100% committed
to this job.

41:35.014 --> 41:38.321
I'm here because I want to be,
and I know what I'm doing.

41:38.365 --> 41:39.366
- I know that.

41:39.409 --> 41:42.412
You're a badass agent, Sheryll.

41:42.456 --> 41:44.850
And I need you
on this team.

41:47.417 --> 41:48.723
Okay?

41:50.029 --> 41:51.509
- Okay.

41:52.640 --> 41:54.860
- Are we good?

41:54.903 --> 41:56.383
- Yeah, we're good.

41:58.385 --> 41:59.995
Just don't try
to hug me or anything.

42:00.039 --> 42:02.563
- [chuckles]
I'll see you tomorrow.

42:02.607 --> 42:03.956
- Yes, you will.

42:03.999 --> 42:07.612
