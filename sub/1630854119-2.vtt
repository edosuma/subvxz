- I didn't say that.
I was just making conversation.

18:52.740 --> 18:55.134
- Felt more like an accusation.

18:55.177 --> 18:57.092
I figured a sister
will help a brother out.

18:57.136 --> 19:00.051
- Hey, I was a cop too
just like you.

19:00.095 --> 19:02.271
Don't be so sensitive.

19:02.315 --> 19:04.491
- Guys, check this out.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.845
- That's hair.

19:10.888 --> 19:12.542
Her hair.

19:12.586 --> 19:14.240
- Chopped it off
to look like a man.

19:17.591 --> 19:18.766
- Ladies.

19:26.426 --> 19:28.079
- That's weird.

19:28.123 --> 19:29.559
Either she likes
to wear men's clothes

19:29.603 --> 19:31.126
or her boyfriend just moved in.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.172
- Yeah, that could be
what's happening.

19:36.653 --> 19:39.395
- Doxepin, Clonidine.

19:39.439 --> 19:42.137
What's this?
- Don't know, but he will.

19:42.181 --> 19:46.533
Jay Safrit MD.
Vanderbilt Psychiatry Group.

19:49.623 --> 19:53.627
- I diagnosed Darla with D.I.D.
four years ago.

19:53.670 --> 19:56.586
Most people know it is
multiple personality disorder.

19:56.630 --> 19:58.893
- Darla has
multiple personalities?

19:58.936 --> 20:00.590
- We call them alters.

20:00.634 --> 20:02.766
Onset in the late 20s
is typical,

20:02.810 --> 20:04.377
but I'm very concerned

20:04.420 --> 20:07.423
because D.I.D. patients
are almost never violent.

20:07.467 --> 20:09.512
- How many alters
does she have?

20:09.556 --> 20:11.862
- For a long time,
it's been two:

20:11.906 --> 20:13.342
Diane and Greg.

20:13.386 --> 20:16.258
When she's on her meds
and coming to therapy,

20:16.302 --> 20:18.434
she can seem
completely in control.

20:18.478 --> 20:21.698
But when she's not, she can't
control when they appear.

20:21.742 --> 20:25.485
She describes it as being
a passenger in her own body.

20:25.528 --> 20:28.401
Here.
This will give you an idea.

20:28.444 --> 20:30.577
This is Darla
presenting as Diane,

20:30.620 --> 20:32.796
a 17-year-old
high school student.

20:33.928 --> 20:36.583
- Mallory thinks
that it's stupid,

20:36.626 --> 20:40.717
but Kim is like,
"You should just run."

20:40.761 --> 20:43.459
- Are you interested
in student government?

20:43.503 --> 20:45.722
- Yeah, for sure.
- Why?

20:47.681 --> 20:50.553
- It'll help me get
into college.

20:50.597 --> 20:52.686
- What about Greg?

20:52.729 --> 20:55.254
- She never becomes him.

20:55.297 --> 20:58.953
He just talks to her a lot.

20:58.996 --> 21:02.522
Here's Darla talking
about Greg.

21:02.565 --> 21:05.438
- He says that
my job is beneath me

21:05.481 --> 21:07.614
and that I'm wasting my life.

21:09.355 --> 21:10.617
"Why don't you find a man?

21:10.660 --> 21:13.272
Why don't you get married
and have kids?"

21:13.315 --> 21:15.186
I like my job.

21:15.230 --> 21:18.755
And I don't need kids
to define me.

21:18.799 --> 21:21.367
- And what do you want, Darla?

21:25.414 --> 21:27.286
- I want him
to leave me alone.

21:27.329 --> 21:28.939
- And so on and so on.

21:28.983 --> 21:31.681
- I noticed in both videos,
she's wearing earbuds.

21:31.725 --> 21:35.206
- When the alters appear,
she'll talk back to them.

21:35.250 --> 21:36.686
She pretends to be on the phone

21:36.730 --> 21:38.427
so people won't think
she's strange.

21:38.471 --> 21:41.343
It's a coping mechanism.

21:41.387 --> 21:43.345
- Would explain
why we can't track the phone.

21:43.389 --> 21:45.347
She doesn't have it on.
- Right.

21:45.391 --> 21:48.219
- You need to know about David.

21:48.263 --> 21:50.700
- Who?
- He's a new alter.

21:50.744 --> 21:52.789
First appeared
about a month ago.

21:52.833 --> 21:55.792
Darla hates him.
So do Diane and Greg.

21:55.836 --> 21:58.012
- The altars know each other?

21:58.055 --> 21:59.753
- In Darla's head, yes.

21:59.796 --> 22:03.757
She'll hear them arguing,
fighting for control of her.

22:03.800 --> 22:07.282
David is mean and aggressive.

22:07.326 --> 22:08.892
Darla calls him the enforcer.

22:08.936 --> 22:10.633
She's afraid of him.

22:10.677 --> 22:11.895
- Let's see the video.

22:11.939 --> 22:13.984
- She wouldn't let me take any.

22:14.028 --> 22:16.378
Something happened
to trigger his emergence,

22:16.422 --> 22:17.988
and Darla wouldn't say what.

22:18.032 --> 22:20.948
And then about ten days ago,
she stopped coming to therapy.

22:20.991 --> 22:23.994
And I'm worried that
David is making her violent,

22:24.038 --> 22:26.475
especially
if she's off her meds.

22:26.519 --> 22:27.911
- What do you think
David wants?

22:27.955 --> 22:30.566
- I don't know.
David's a mystery.

22:30.610 --> 22:32.916
Diane and Greg, I get.

22:32.960 --> 22:37.051
The sister she never had,
the father who never loved her.

22:37.094 --> 22:39.749
- What do you mean "the father
who never loved her"?

22:39.793 --> 22:41.098
Did he abuse her?

22:41.142 --> 22:43.840
- Well, 95% of the time
with D.I.D. patients,

22:43.884 --> 22:45.712
that's the case.

22:45.755 --> 22:49.063
But Darla's trauma
was different.

22:49.106 --> 22:51.065
- What happened to her?

22:51.108 --> 22:54.416
- Darla's parents abandoned her
when she was seven years old.

22:54.460 --> 22:58.681
They were at rest up in
Kentucky and just disappeared.

22:58.725 --> 23:01.075
No explanation.
No goodbye.

23:01.118 --> 23:02.729
No nothing.

23:02.772 --> 23:03.904
- That's awful.
[phone ringing]

23:03.947 --> 23:06.036
Did she go in the system?

23:06.080 --> 23:09.039
- 11 different foster homes
by the time she was 18.

23:09.083 --> 23:10.998
Never went to college,
always lived alone.

23:11.041 --> 23:13.609
And according to Dr. Safrit,
those first two alters emerged

23:13.653 --> 23:15.655
as her way of coping.

23:15.698 --> 23:18.875
- David's a different story.
- He's the key.

23:18.919 --> 23:22.096
If we can figure out what
made him emerge a month ago,

23:22.139 --> 23:23.967
maybe we can predict
what's next.

23:24.011 --> 23:26.361
- Is there anything
in Darla's personnel file?

23:26.405 --> 23:27.667
- I haven't had a chance
to look.

23:27.710 --> 23:29.799
- I did. Nothing
but eight annual reviews,

23:29.843 --> 23:31.148
all of them good.

23:31.192 --> 23:33.977
No mention of any health
or psychiatric issues.

23:34.021 --> 23:35.936
Her boss might not
even know she's sick.

23:35.979 --> 23:38.895
- Remy, Murfreesboro PD
found Darla's Prius

23:38.939 --> 23:40.897
about a half mile
from the IRS office.

23:40.941 --> 23:43.117
The parking attendant said
it's been there for two days.

23:43.160 --> 23:44.510
- All right.
You and Ray with me.

23:44.553 --> 23:46.120
Let's hit it.

23:52.518 --> 23:54.868
- Hey, are you all right?
- Yeah.

23:56.696 --> 23:59.742
I know this is stupid,
but in the old days,

23:59.786 --> 24:01.091
Jess would have
taken me with him

24:01.135 --> 24:03.703
to go see the psychiatrist
this morning.

24:03.746 --> 24:06.445
I feel like
Remy doesn't trust me.

24:06.488 --> 24:07.924
- Come on, Sheryll.
- No, I'm serious.

24:07.968 --> 24:10.057
I feel like he's icing me out.

24:10.100 --> 24:11.493
- Let me ask you something.

24:11.537 --> 24:13.756
How long have you been back?

24:13.800 --> 24:15.410
About a week?

24:15.454 --> 24:16.846
You remember the way
you guys were with me

24:16.890 --> 24:19.370
when I first turned up?

24:19.414 --> 24:20.720
- It wasn't like this.

24:20.763 --> 24:22.809
- Yeah, it kind of was.

24:22.852 --> 24:25.376
You know this stuff takes time.

24:25.420 --> 24:28.075
Just do what you do.

24:33.907 --> 24:36.518
- Darla,
please don't make this worse.

24:36.562 --> 24:37.954
We have to get out of here.

24:37.998 --> 24:39.521
- Wait, is that him?

24:39.565 --> 24:41.001
It's okay.
He didn't see us.

24:41.044 --> 24:42.742
He doesn't know we're here.

24:44.091 --> 24:46.876
- Darla, no,
don't follow him.

24:48.574 --> 24:50.576
- The FBI put your picture
on the news.

24:50.619 --> 24:52.708
You shouldn't be in public.
- Dad's right.

24:52.752 --> 24:54.841
Do you wanna spend
the rest of our lives in jail?

24:54.884 --> 24:57.060
- Just go.
Turn around and walk away

24:57.104 --> 24:58.497
before it's too late.

24:58.540 --> 24:59.846
- He's
in the produce section now.

24:59.889 --> 25:01.108
- Just leave him.

25:01.151 --> 25:02.892
The longer we're here,
the worse it is.

25:02.936 --> 25:04.198
What if
someone recognizes you?

25:04.241 --> 25:06.505
- Excuse me, sir.
Sir.

25:06.548 --> 25:07.549
- See?

25:07.593 --> 25:09.116
- I need to get
some chili flakes.

25:09.159 --> 25:10.465
- Don't look at her.

25:10.509 --> 25:11.901
Just stay calm.

25:11.945 --> 25:14.600
Turn around and walk away.

25:14.643 --> 25:16.079
- There he is again.

25:16.123 --> 25:17.907
- Walk away, Darla.

25:17.951 --> 25:19.082
It's okay.

25:19.126 --> 25:20.780
He still didn't see us.

25:20.823 --> 25:22.433
He just walked right by.

25:22.477 --> 25:23.826
- Darla, no!

25:27.134 --> 25:28.744
- Just let him
leave the store.

25:28.788 --> 25:31.486
Let him take his things and
get in his car and go home.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.749
You don't wanna hurt him.
David does.

25:33.793 --> 25:35.751
- Think
about his wife and kids.

25:35.795 --> 25:37.753
- Darla,
David's making you do this.

25:37.797 --> 25:39.059
- We know you hate him.

25:39.102 --> 25:40.626
- You don't have
to listen to him.

25:40.669 --> 25:42.062
The truck's
right around the corner.

25:42.105 --> 25:44.586
Just get in and drive,
and this can all be over.

25:44.630 --> 25:46.762
- He stopped.
He's coming back this way.

25:46.806 --> 25:49.591
- I'm begging you,
please don't do this.

25:49.635 --> 25:51.027
- I can make it look
like a robbery.

25:51.071 --> 25:53.943
- It won't matter.
Darla, you can still get away.

25:53.987 --> 25:56.119
Maybe Canada, or even Mexico--
- Stop.

25:56.163 --> 25:57.643
- You're not a killer.

25:57.686 --> 26:00.123
David's the killer,
but you have to tell him no.

26:00.167 --> 26:01.995
You can do this.
- Listen to Dad.

26:02.038 --> 26:04.563
We love you.
- Tell him no, Darla.

26:04.606 --> 26:07.043
Turn around and walk away.

About two months ago, she came
to my office very upset.

29:08.355 --> 29:11.140
She had just come back from
a work conference in Orlando,

29:11.184 --> 29:12.838
the one sponsored
by the law firm

29:12.881 --> 29:14.622
where they put everybody up
at the Royal--

29:14.665 --> 29:15.884
- Why was she upset?

29:17.494 --> 29:20.454
- She said she had
a few drinks one night

29:20.497 --> 29:24.501
and found herself in a room
with Bill and Marion Meeks.

29:24.545 --> 29:25.676
She blacked out.

29:25.720 --> 29:26.982
When she woke up
the next morning,

29:27.026 --> 29:30.377
she felt like
she'd been sexually assaulted

29:30.420 --> 29:33.815
by either Bill or Marion,
maybe both.

- Hell no.

29:37.906 --> 29:39.603
Why didn't you tell me?

29:39.647 --> 29:41.518
- Because
she withdrew the complaint.

First thing I told her
was go to the police.

29:43.869 --> 29:45.174
"They'll take
your medical history.

29:45.218 --> 29:46.828
They'll have you examined
by a doctor."

29:46.872 --> 29:49.570
As soon as I said that,
she completely backtracked.

29:49.613 --> 29:51.615
Said maybe she was wrong.

29:51.659 --> 29:53.226
It was probably
all in her head.

29:53.269 --> 29:55.228

as soon as she found out
she'd have to see a doctor,

30:17.816 --> 30:20.514
probably afraid they find out
about her condition.

that explains Meeks wife.

have been the final straw.
