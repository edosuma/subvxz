WEBVTT

00:08.704 --> 00:10.314
Plantars, assemble!

00:10.358 --> 00:11.446
Present!

00:11.489 --> 00:12.621
What's up?
Any news?

00:12.664 --> 00:14.101
I got a text from Dr. Jan.

00:14.144 --> 00:16.103
It says, "Come see me
when you've got a moment.

00:16.146 --> 00:17.321
I think I found something."

00:17.365 --> 00:20.629
Which means,
the sooner we talk to her,
the sooner we get you home.

00:20.672 --> 00:21.978
Yeah!

00:22.022 --> 00:23.632
- Yahoo!
Sounds good!

00:25.373 --> 00:28.245
Oh, good. You're here.
Help us finish loading the car.

00:28.289 --> 00:29.725
No problem,
Mrs. Boonchuy.

00:29.768 --> 00:31.161
We'd be glad
to help.

00:31.205 --> 00:32.467
I can't carry much,
but okay.

00:32.510 --> 00:34.991
Okay, but then we gotta
get to the museum.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.646
No way. It's market day
at the Thai temple

00:37.689 --> 00:39.256
and we are all
going to be there.

00:39.300 --> 00:42.259
But, Mom!
It's super important.

00:42.303 --> 00:43.478
So is this.

00:43.521 --> 00:46.481
The Thai community
hasn't seen you
since you came back.

00:46.524 --> 00:48.439
And this is the
perfect opportunity.

00:48.483 --> 00:50.311
- But--
- No "but."

00:50.354 --> 00:51.660
Look,
I'll make you a deal.

00:51.703 --> 00:55.490
Just stay for one full hour,
then you can go do whatever.

00:55.533 --> 00:57.448
Fine.

00:57.492 --> 00:59.494
Market day? Temple?

00:59.537 --> 01:02.236
It's a monthly all-day event
at the Thai temple.

01:02.279 --> 01:07.154
Everyone gathers for food,
music, sport, dance
and Thai language school.

01:07.197 --> 01:08.590
It's, uh...

01:09.634 --> 01:11.288
Hey! I see you!

01:11.332 --> 01:12.463
Dezi, Rico!

01:12.507 --> 01:13.769
What was that all about?

01:13.812 --> 01:16.772
Ugh, nosy gossip bloggers
from the school paper

01:16.815 --> 01:19.949
trying to get an exclusive photo
of the "girl who went missing."

01:19.992 --> 01:22.517
Oh! Well,
I got some photos
they can use.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.780
Here's you eating spaghetti
when you were two.

01:24.823 --> 01:26.956
Oh, and here's you
when you were--
Dad!

01:26.999 --> 01:28.784
Oh, my gosh!
Stop!
Never!

01:31.830 --> 01:33.267
Just look
at this place.
Wowsers!

01:33.310 --> 01:34.311
Wow!

01:34.355 --> 01:37.053
The style sort of
remind me of Wartwood.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.576
Look, there's
even a statue.

01:38.620 --> 01:42.145
No, way!
Is this you?

01:42.189 --> 01:44.147
Yep, I've been coming here
since I was a kid.

01:44.191 --> 01:47.629
It seems cool at first,
but believe me,
it gets old quick.

01:54.201 --> 01:56.377
You are on sample duty today.

01:56.420 --> 01:59.597
Now stand out in the open
where everyone can see you.

01:59.641 --> 02:01.599
Wait. By everyone
you don't mean...

02:01.643 --> 02:04.167
Anne's here!
She is back!

02:04.211 --> 02:06.387
Oh, shoot!
Here comes the Ba train.

02:06.430 --> 02:08.432
Welcome back,
young Anne.
Hi, Ba-Med.

02:08.476 --> 02:11.348
Where have you been
worrying your parents
like that?

02:11.392 --> 02:14.438
Good to see you, Papu.
It was just a little
misunderstanding.

02:14.482 --> 02:16.571
They forgot I was
at tennis camp.

02:16.614 --> 02:19.313
Eh, typical.
You got so skinny.

02:19.356 --> 02:21.445
Here.
Eat something.

02:21.489 --> 02:22.403
Okay,
good to see you.

02:22.446 --> 02:23.578
Bye-bye!

02:23.621 --> 02:25.188
Hey, what does
this mean?

02:25.232 --> 02:28.365
It's called a <i>wai.
It's how you show respect
to your elders.</i>

02:28.409 --> 02:30.802
Super important
in Thai culture.

02:30.846 --> 02:34.328
Make sense to me.
You kids can learn
a couple of things here.

02:34.371 --> 02:36.025
Well, we've got
some time to kill.

02:36.068 --> 02:37.635
You three are free
to explore, if you want.

02:37.679 --> 02:39.246
Just be careful to keep
those disguises...

02:39.289 --> 02:40.899
Whoo-hoo!
...on.

02:40.943 --> 02:42.597
Whoo-hoo!
Whoa! Look at this!

02:44.338 --> 02:46.209
Hold on, Dr. Jan.

02:46.253 --> 02:47.950
Just one hour
and I'll be there.

02:50.518 --> 02:52.346
♪ <i>I'm walking like a human</i>♪

02:56.872 --> 03:00.441
And if you want to say
it's bedtime, we say...

03:02.182 --> 03:04.793
Very good!
You taken Thai before?

03:12.192 --> 03:13.628
Ooh. Wow!

03:13.671 --> 03:14.803
Show-off.

03:14.846 --> 03:16.674
Huh?

03:21.549 --> 03:24.291
Ooh! Excuse me,
what's all this then?

03:24.334 --> 03:25.466
It's Khon dancing.

03:25.509 --> 03:28.120
A performance art
where dancers tell
a beautiful drama

03:28.164 --> 03:31.472
of epic scale
through intricate movements
and expressive gestures.

03:31.515 --> 03:36.607
Intricate movements?
Expressive gestures?
Drama? I'm in!

03:47.575 --> 03:49.229
Whoo-hoo!
This guy's good.

03:50.142 --> 03:52.275
I love it here!

03:55.496 --> 03:57.541
I wish Anne had told me
about these earlier.

03:57.585 --> 03:59.413
Huh?

04:02.459 --> 04:03.765
Oops! Heads-up!

04:09.336 --> 04:11.338
Hey, new guy,
join our team.

04:11.381 --> 04:12.730
Hey,
we saw him first.

04:12.774 --> 04:16.473
Calm down, everyone.
Plenty of Sprig
to go around.

04:17.692 --> 04:19.998
Moo Ping! Come get
your Moo Ping here.

04:20.042 --> 04:22.392
Welcome back, Anne.
Nice to see you again,
Anne.

04:23.611 --> 04:24.873
What you got there,
Mom?

04:24.916 --> 04:26.570
Just returning
a few dishes

04:26.614 --> 04:28.833
some of the community
members lent me.

04:30.748 --> 04:33.273
All right. It must've been
almost an hour by now.

04:34.143 --> 04:36.537
It's only been ten minutes!

04:36.580 --> 04:38.539
That's it.

04:38.582 --> 04:41.106
Sorry, Mom, but I have
more important things
to do today

04:41.150 --> 04:42.369
than hand out samples.

04:42.412 --> 04:44.371
Hey, Dr. Jan.
It's me, Anne.

04:44.414 --> 04:48.592
<i>I'm at the Thai temple
but I'll be at the museum
in 30 minutes tops.</i>

04:53.075 --> 04:55.077
<i>Deploying drones.</i>

04:59.603 --> 05:02.302
<i>Search and destroy.</i>

05:05.435 --> 05:10.005
Now, all I got to do
is collect those frogs
and avoid some parents.

05:12.094 --> 05:14.009
First, a decoy.

05:15.097 --> 05:16.403
Psst!
I'll give you five bucks

05:16.446 --> 05:18.492
to pretend to be me
for 45 minutes.

05:18.535 --> 05:19.580
I don't see why not.

05:20.842 --> 05:23.018
So you're gonna
write me a check or...

05:28.632 --> 05:31.113
Sprig! Hey, Sprig!
Whoa!

05:35.683 --> 05:37.032
- Yes!

05:37.075 --> 05:39.730
Wow! He is really good
at that.

05:39.774 --> 05:41.428
Looks like he's
is having fun too.

05:41.471 --> 05:42.994
Maybe he can give
this one a miss.

05:48.260 --> 05:50.524
Psst! Hop Pop! Psst!

05:50.567 --> 05:53.396
Shh, Anne.
This is silent theater.

05:58.575 --> 06:01.448
Man, those two have really
gotten sucked in.

06:06.104 --> 06:07.584
What the heck?

06:07.628 --> 06:11.458
I sat through Thai school
for years and can barely string
a sentence together.

06:13.373 --> 06:17.202
It is sort of neat to see
all three of them connecting
to Thai culture like this.

06:17.246 --> 06:19.553
I'll just update them
after I see Dr. Jan.

06:19.596 --> 06:20.597
Mom?

06:21.859 --> 06:24.340
Anne? You're supposed
to be at the stand.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.821
Oh. Why, yes.
You see--

06:26.864 --> 06:29.563
You were sneaking out
to visit your museum friend,
weren't you?

06:29.606 --> 06:34.263
What?

06:34.306 --> 06:36.439
Okay, you got me.
I don't believe this.

06:36.483 --> 06:38.528
You really couldn't
wait one hour?

06:38.572 --> 06:41.836
Look,
I already said hi
to everyone.

06:41.879 --> 06:43.315
Now I have to get
to the museum

06:43.359 --> 06:45.013
so I can get my
interdimensional friends home.

06:45.056 --> 06:46.536
It's super important.

06:46.580 --> 06:49.452
So is this.
We owe so much
to this community.

06:49.496 --> 06:51.715
Why do you think
I'm returning all
these dishes?

06:51.759 --> 06:54.370
I don't know.
'Cause you had
a potluck party?

06:54.414 --> 06:56.590
No, everyone here
cooked us meals

06:56.633 --> 06:59.419
and took care of me and Dad
for all those months
you were gone.

07:00.768 --> 07:04.075
Oh, I--
I had no idea.

07:04.685 --> 07:06.469
Wow. I feel like a jerk.

07:06.513 --> 07:09.298
They were worried
about you and us.

07:09.341 --> 07:12.301
The community ran a store
here and sent us the money.

07:12.344 --> 07:14.521
Even helped out
at the restaurant.

07:14.564 --> 07:16.523
And never asked
for anything in return.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.613
That's really cool.

07:19.656 --> 07:21.310
It is pretty cool.

07:23.312 --> 07:25.967
Huh?
What are those things?

07:26.010 --> 07:27.751
What's going on?

07:30.319 --> 07:32.713
What? Drones? They must be
from the robot.

07:32.756 --> 07:34.758
What robot?
Uh...

07:34.802 --> 07:39.502
The robot is the name
of the gossip blog
those girls from school run.

07:39.546 --> 07:41.548
They must have sent
the drones to take
more photos of me.

07:41.591 --> 07:43.724
Just tell everyone
they have to take cover.

07:43.767 --> 07:44.551
I've got this.

07:47.771 --> 07:50.731
Anne, we heard a blast.
What's going on?

07:50.774 --> 07:52.559
Looks like the robot sent
some scouts after us.

07:52.602 --> 07:55.387
We have to protect the temple
and everyone in it.

07:55.431 --> 07:58.608
We're right behind you.

07:58.652 --> 08:01.655
Mom, I told you
to tell everyone
to take cover!

08:01.698 --> 08:04.135
This is our temple
and our community.

08:04.179 --> 08:07.095
When one of us
is under a threat,
we all are.

08:07.138 --> 08:10.620
Yeah, be gone, Saint James
Middle School paparazzi.

08:10.664 --> 08:13.536
Yeah! Yeah!
We've got your back!

08:21.631 --> 08:22.806
All right, everyone!

08:45.960 --> 08:47.570
Whoo!
It's good!

08:47.614 --> 08:49.572
Sample this!

08:49.616 --> 08:51.139
Yeah!

08:51.182 --> 08:54.621
All right, you evil bug bots,
sample this too.

08:57.972 --> 08:59.364
Anne's dad!

08:59.408 --> 09:00.670
Sprig, kick me!

09:14.858 --> 09:16.643
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

09:16.686 --> 09:19.646
Guys, your disguises.
They've fallen off.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.215
Uh...

09:24.259 --> 09:26.609
Uh, everyone,
I can explain.

09:26.653 --> 09:29.046
No, no, no.
No need to know.

09:29.090 --> 09:30.613
If they're your friends...

09:30.657 --> 09:32.223
...then they are
our friends too.

09:32.267 --> 09:33.964
No matter how ugly
they are.

09:34.008 --> 09:35.052
Ouch!

09:35.096 --> 09:36.750
It's funny,
but it still stings.

09:36.793 --> 09:38.273
They're talking
about you too.

09:38.316 --> 09:40.754
Wow! Thanks, you guys.

09:40.797 --> 09:42.712
I don't even know
what to say except...

09:45.585 --> 09:47.195
Oh, that's so polite.

09:51.547 --> 09:54.898
Man, middle school equipment
is really advanced these days.

09:54.942 --> 09:59.207
Well, hour's up.
You're probably itching
to get out of here.

10:00.730 --> 10:03.646
I-- I think I'd like
to stay a bit longer.

10:03.690 --> 10:06.649
I thought you had more
important things to do.

10:06.693 --> 10:07.737
Mom!

10:07.781 --> 10:09.043
Just kidding.
Just kidding.

10:11.741 --> 10:12.916
Dr. Jan?

10:12.960 --> 10:14.439
Sorry, guys,
this couldn't wait.

10:14.483 --> 10:16.180
It's just too dang exciting.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.661
Ooh!

10:18.705 --> 10:20.881
It's written in some kind
of ancient language.

10:20.924 --> 10:22.709
If only we could read it.

10:22.752 --> 10:25.581
Wait. According to
Marcy's notes it says,

10:25.625 --> 10:29.933
"Seek the mother of alms,
she will guide you
to your destiny."

10:34.634 --> 10:35.809
That do anything
for anyone?

10:35.852 --> 10:37.898
Not especially.
No, sirree.
