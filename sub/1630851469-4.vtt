WEBVTT

00:09.240 --> 00:10.480
Before the last election

00:10.560 --> 00:14.880
I promised the people of Scotland
a referendum on independence.

00:14.960 --> 00:18.200
Russia is adept at undermining
and controlling small states.

00:18.280 --> 00:21.200
Creating one in Scotland
would be a coup.

00:21.280 --> 00:26.280
Redback is the code name for a major
terror attack on British soil.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.760
Oleg Adamov.

00:27.840 --> 00:29.680
This guy is a serious player.

00:29.760 --> 00:32.800
My money's on him still being
in London. OK, let's bring him in.

00:32.880 --> 00:34.840
Holly is in no way relevant
to the referendum.

00:34.920 --> 00:37.880
A troubled, young Scottish woman
who may or may not be your daughter?

00:37.960 --> 00:39.160
We've intercepted chatter

00:39.240 --> 00:41.480
about a credible threat
to your prime minister.

00:41.560 --> 00:43.560
This man here, Shaun Graham.

00:43.640 --> 00:45.320
I'm not your fucking mate, Cornwell!

00:45.400 --> 00:47.000
I'm coming for you!

00:47.640 --> 00:48.720
Don't move.

00:48.800 --> 00:49.960
Drop the gun.

00:50.880 --> 00:53.240
-He's been using the term Redback?
-Yeah.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.440
That puts him at the top
of your potential buyers' list.

00:56.520 --> 00:59.520
But what's his connection
to Oleg Adamov?

00:59.600 --> 01:00.760
What is Redback?

01:00.840 --> 01:02.880
It's some kind
of terror threat, isn't it?

01:02.960 --> 01:03.960
We don't know.

01:04.960 --> 01:07.160
-Freeze! Don't move!
-Who fired?

01:22.880 --> 01:25.600
So, as the Prime Minister
leaves the studio,

01:25.680 --> 01:27.480
an IED blows the electricity.

01:27.560 --> 01:29.400
The power supply's
at the rear of the building.

01:29.480 --> 01:33.600
The gunman broke into the box
and attached an IED with a timer.

01:33.680 --> 01:37.840
No prints. Chaos. Shouting. Gunfire.

01:37.920 --> 01:39.040
A single shot.

01:39.120 --> 01:43.400
The PM's down and our shooter,
Shaun Graham, he's in the wind.

01:43.920 --> 01:44.840
He's gone.

01:47.120 --> 01:48.800
Marcus, anything?

01:48.880 --> 01:50.960
No sign of Shaun Graham
or any of his known contacts.

01:51.040 --> 01:52.880
Nothing from airports or docks.

01:52.960 --> 01:54.440
<i>What about his inside guy?</i>

01:54.520 --> 01:56.680
Admits he gave Graham
his pass and his uniform.

01:56.760 --> 01:58.480
Picked up a cool 200 quid.

01:58.560 --> 02:00.200
Life in prison for 200 quid?

02:00.280 --> 02:01.400
Right, keep looking.

02:01.480 --> 02:02.320
<i>Will do, yeah.</i>

02:03.720 --> 02:06.920
-So, he just walked through?
-And walked right out again.

02:08.520 --> 02:09.880
Why did he only fire one shot?

02:09.960 --> 02:12.480
We gonna have to sift
through every piece of CCTV footage

02:12.560 --> 02:13.800
in the surrounding area.

02:13.880 --> 02:16.680
Track down any passing vehicles
with dash cams.

02:33.400 --> 02:34.240
Levi?

02:36.480 --> 02:38.320
Looks like someone
was trying to make a point.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.400
-Yes?
<i>-Boss.</i>

02:45.160 --> 02:46.280
<i>They found Shaun Graham.</i>

03:50.080 --> 03:51.400
You happy it's Shaun Graham?

03:51.880 --> 03:52.720
Hundred per cent.

03:54.160 --> 03:56.640
So, SOCO thinks
he climbed up on here...

03:58.240 --> 04:00.600
tied the rope off and then jumped.

04:00.680 --> 04:01.560
Open and shut.

04:02.400 --> 04:05.480
I think it's time we downgraded
Redback to follow-up status.

04:06.600 --> 04:08.480
"Redback" written
on a picture of the PM.

04:09.040 --> 04:12.240
A week later,
two assassination attempts.

04:12.800 --> 04:13.760
That it. We're done.

04:23.040 --> 04:26.080
OK, Adam will be down in a minute.
What are your concerns?

04:26.160 --> 04:28.320
He literally stared
down the barrel of a gun.

04:28.400 --> 04:29.320
Twice.

04:29.400 --> 04:30.200
I was there.

04:30.280 --> 04:31.760
He's pretending
it's business as usual.

04:31.840 --> 04:33.880
He's agreed to the debate
going ahead today.

04:34.440 --> 04:35.560
Are you OK with that?

04:35.640 --> 04:37.640
Adam doesn't respond well
to being handled,

04:38.440 --> 04:40.720
but he did listen
to Chief of Security's advice.

04:40.800 --> 04:43.000
-To hold the debate here?
-That's not nothing.

04:43.080 --> 04:45.920
He won't like me saying this,
but right now the polls are good.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.120
What we don't need
is a shit show of a debate.

04:49.280 --> 04:52.200
Etta, I'm asking,
as his closest friend,

04:53.240 --> 04:54.040
is he up to it?

04:56.600 --> 04:58.000
Good morning, everybody.

04:58.920 --> 05:00.520
Very tight schedule today,

05:00.600 --> 05:03.160
but the busier, the better.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.640
I want you all to know I've got this.

05:11.120 --> 05:14.240
So, if there are any concerns,
thank you for caring,

05:15.000 --> 05:16.680
but we've got a referendum to win.

05:28.440 --> 05:31.800
Alexander Kutiev wasn't talking
about clowns like these.

05:31.880 --> 05:33.960
What, when he was bartering
for a new house?

05:34.040 --> 05:37.080
Shaun Graham
manipulated Nigel Braynor

05:37.160 --> 05:38.400
into an attempt on the PM's life.

05:38.480 --> 05:42.360
When that failed he went
to the radio station to do the job.

05:42.440 --> 05:43.840
So, then why take one shot?

05:43.920 --> 05:45.200
One bullet in the gun?

05:47.640 --> 05:50.600
He took a shot, missed
and then hung himself.

05:50.680 --> 05:53.840
He wrote "Redback" at the scene.
You can't just ignore that.

05:53.920 --> 05:57.120
What, a dad who's pissed off
he can't see his son.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.120
Another guy, one bullet in his gun?

05:59.200 --> 06:01.160
Redback has got
to be bigger than this.

06:01.240 --> 06:03.400
Bigger than...
They came within a ball hair

06:03.480 --> 06:05.360
of killing the Prime Minister.

06:05.440 --> 06:08.160
Yeah, plus, they had access
to Etta Cornwell's diary.

06:11.760 --> 06:15.240
You want everything tied off
in a neat bow, don't you, Levi?

06:18.120 --> 06:20.480
There's far more to it than this.
This is not Redback.

06:21.760 --> 06:24.080
You're asking the right questions,
Beatrice.

06:24.160 --> 06:25.560
Please find some answers.

06:33.720 --> 06:35.200
I don't think we take any questions.

06:35.280 --> 06:37.840
I think we just make the statement
and then move on.

06:37.920 --> 06:38.840
Prime Minister...

06:43.520 --> 06:45.080
Both your assassins are dead

06:45.800 --> 06:48.160
and close security
has returned to amber.

06:49.920 --> 06:51.720
-The Prime Minister has a press...
-Yes.

06:52.560 --> 06:53.600
How will you play it?

06:54.920 --> 06:55.880
Play it?

06:57.920 --> 07:00.600
There are forces ranged against you.

07:01.080 --> 07:02.800
We believe the attempt on your life

07:02.880 --> 07:06.080
was funded by a group who are also
backing Scottish terrorists.

07:07.480 --> 07:10.440
When you ignore our advice

07:11.920 --> 07:14.640
you put yourself in danger,
but, more importantly,

07:15.360 --> 07:19.040
you imperil the entire nation.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.400
Those officers
cannot have died for nothing.

07:24.880 --> 07:26.320
Please make your speech count.

07:31.360 --> 07:33.520
Mr. Cheery. Are you OK?

07:33.600 --> 07:34.600
I'm fine.

07:36.880 --> 07:38.080
Good morning, everyone.

07:39.320 --> 07:40.240
Morning.

07:45.760 --> 07:48.760
If you want change in the world,
you have to talk.

07:50.520 --> 07:53.040
Guns don't facilitate a dialogue.

07:53.760 --> 07:54.720
They stop it.

07:57.280 --> 07:58.400
OK.

08:01.800 --> 08:04.800
If this was found in reception,
then when did he do this?

08:05.840 --> 08:08.600
And why was the work roster
even in reception?

08:09.560 --> 08:10.600
What do you mean?

08:11.800 --> 08:14.760
Just, staff need to know what
they're doing that day, don't they?

08:18.800 --> 08:21.040
Two years of scooping popcorn
in a multiplex.

08:21.120 --> 08:22.680
Rosters get hung in the locker room.

08:31.000 --> 08:31.800
Yes, Beatrice?

08:32.320 --> 08:35.120
This is a security work roster.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.520
So, a helpful PC took it to his DI
in reception where it was logged.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.240
-OK.
-Play the tape.

08:41.840 --> 08:42.840
Playing.

08:51.880 --> 08:53.040
Oleg Adamov.

08:53.800 --> 08:56.640
Yeah. And that's the...

08:56.720 --> 08:59.040
It's the staff
back room at City Radio.

09:00.760 --> 09:01.760
What's he doing?

09:03.000 --> 09:04.320
He's making his point.

09:07.800 --> 09:09.560
Could be Shaun Graham's accomplice.

09:10.120 --> 09:11.520
Oleg Adamov

09:12.560 --> 09:13.960
is no one's accomplice.

09:17.720 --> 09:19.160
Those are night goggles.

09:31.840 --> 09:32.640
Yeah.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.240
He's a funny guy.

09:38.080 --> 09:39.240
What was he doing?

09:39.760 --> 09:42.120
He's just saying "fuck you."

09:43.200 --> 09:44.880
"Fuck you" to who, though?

09:47.880 --> 09:49.000
He's Redback.

09:51.600 --> 09:52.760
Well, if he isn't,

09:53.840 --> 09:54.800
he knows who is.

09:55.720 --> 09:56.960
He's taunting us.

09:58.320 --> 10:01.560
That bastard killed Glen
and he's just smiling at us.

10:03.400 --> 10:05.120
I'll rip that grin off his face.

10:09.600 --> 10:12.840
If there is to be a change,
it must be the will

10:13.800 --> 10:17.480
of a firm and healthy majority.

10:17.560 --> 10:20.240
Historic changes
cannot be allowed to take place

10:20.320 --> 10:21.640
on the whim of fractions.

10:21.720 --> 10:23.840
I thought we changed
"whim of fractions."

10:25.000 --> 10:26.560
What? When?

10:26.640 --> 10:29.280
You'd rather say, "Without..."

10:29.360 --> 10:33.440
Without... without a clear
and visible mandate. Yes.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.680
These last-minute changes,
it just feels desperate.

10:38.800 --> 10:41.640
Adam, why don't we take a break?

10:43.840 --> 10:44.640
Sure.

10:46.440 --> 10:47.680
Let's take five, shall we?

10:51.680 --> 10:54.680
I could try to reschedule,
if you need me at the debate.

10:55.400 --> 10:57.560
No, if I need anything,
I'll ask for it.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.880
And you can tell Nicky to relax.

11:01.360 --> 11:03.960
I appreciate what you're trying
to do, but I'm good.

11:05.400 --> 11:07.040
Have you heard from Holly today?

11:08.280 --> 11:09.920
A couple of texts. Nothing special.

11:10.520 --> 11:11.320
I think

11:12.640 --> 11:14.240
without knowing if she's mine...

11:15.760 --> 11:16.960
Don't leave her hanging.

11:19.080 --> 11:22.160
This Superman act
doesn't wash with me.

11:24.720 --> 11:25.920
I'm fine.

11:36.680 --> 11:37.840
Sorry, I...

11:49.680 --> 11:50.840
What can I get you?

11:50.920 --> 11:52.320
Bruce, please.

11:54.080 --> 11:57.560
Two attempts and he's still standing.
Your man's got <i>cojones.</i>

11:57.640 --> 11:58.640
My man?

11:59.200 --> 12:00.400
Adam Cornwell.

12:03.280 --> 12:04.920
That's a nice jacket. Distinctive.

12:05.360 --> 12:06.200
Thanks.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.200
Gets me noticed.

12:09.960 --> 12:11.320
Could I buy you a drink, then?

12:15.800 --> 12:17.840
I'm a No, by the way.

12:21.040 --> 12:22.040
Me, too.

12:24.120 --> 12:26.720
Don't tell my mum, though.
She'd go mental.

12:28.040 --> 12:28.880
What about yours?

12:34.320 --> 12:36.360
-Shit. Have I...
-No, you're all right.

12:38.440 --> 12:39.880
Do you wanna take a break, Holly?

12:42.240 --> 12:43.240
Yeah.

12:59.120 --> 13:00.240
<i>Scottish Sun.</i>

13:00.320 --> 13:01.360
Hey, Shirl. It's Robert.

13:01.440 --> 13:03.440
Could you put me through
to the editor, please?

13:03.520 --> 13:04.320
<i>Sure.</i>

13:06.160 --> 13:07.720
<i>Tell me we've got</i>
<i>a front page tomorrow?</i>

13:07.800 --> 13:11.120
I'm working on it. She's definitely
the girl the PM was snapped with.

13:11.200 --> 13:12.240
<i>So, are they shagging?</i>

13:13.160 --> 13:14.840
It's not the vibe I'm getting.

13:14.920 --> 13:15.920
<i>But it's not a no?</i>

13:16.760 --> 13:18.400
<i>See what you can find out,</i>
<i>but make it quick.</i>

13:18.480 --> 13:20.560
<i>-I need something going out.</i>
-I've got to go.

13:23.480 --> 13:24.400
OK.

13:26.120 --> 13:26.960
A pint of cider.

13:27.840 --> 13:29.000
Yeah. OK.

13:33.600 --> 13:36.640
Right, we've got a trail
that's gonna lead us right to Adamov.

13:36.720 --> 13:39.360
Nail his scrotum
to the walls, literally.

13:39.440 --> 13:40.400
As in not literally.

13:40.480 --> 13:41.840
Obviously. That'd be disgusting.

13:41.920 --> 13:44.040
Right, so, VX residue results.

13:44.120 --> 13:46.680
The areas in red
show where Oleg Adamov spent,

13:46.760 --> 13:48.920
in their words,
"a not insignificant amount of time."

13:49.000 --> 13:52.240
So, the shopping center where Glen
died shows the largest trace.

13:52.320 --> 13:53.400
This is weird.

13:54.720 --> 13:56.800
One of the places that shows
the largest molecular trace

13:56.880 --> 13:58.400
is the radio station, right?

13:59.280 --> 14:00.840
But not at Shaun Graham's place.

14:00.920 --> 14:02.880
Or Irene Amrose's place.

14:04.680 --> 14:07.160
What, so judging by this,
the only place that Oleg Adamov

14:07.240 --> 14:09.680
and Shaun Graham overlapped
was at the radio station.

14:10.880 --> 14:13.320
OK, check every single one
of these addresses, all right?

14:13.400 --> 14:16.240
Work out what these hot spots are
and why Adamov was there.

14:16.320 --> 14:19.000
You mean leave here
and actually go outdoors?

14:19.080 --> 14:20.280
Outdoors is overrated.

14:21.320 --> 14:22.520
Oh, a call came in for you.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.240
Your Scottish friend
wants to meet up.

14:25.360 --> 14:27.080
So, what were his exact words?

14:27.720 --> 14:30.240
Uh, "Tell Beatrice
meeting up would be prudent,

14:30.320 --> 14:32.520
especially as the Underground
is running smoothly."

15:14.040 --> 15:14.920
Beard's new.

15:16.680 --> 15:17.600
Suits you.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.640
Thanks for coming all this way.

15:22.560 --> 15:23.600
It's good to see you.

15:25.600 --> 15:26.520
Same.

15:27.640 --> 15:28.960
You been looking after yourself?

15:29.920 --> 15:30.760
Yeah.

15:32.720 --> 15:33.680
Keeping fit?

15:34.280 --> 15:35.440
I run every day.

15:37.040 --> 15:38.160
Give or take.

15:43.800 --> 15:44.760
Alcohol-free?

15:46.280 --> 15:47.880
Unless the job demands it.

15:49.760 --> 15:53.280
Yeah, I'm not dealing with Quakers
here. All right, I like a drink.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.200
What was so urgent?

16:00.520 --> 16:02.680
I've been brought
into the inner sanctum.

16:06.280 --> 16:07.160
Well done.

16:08.840 --> 16:09.920
So, where are we?

16:10.720 --> 16:12.360
Laird's locked in a target.

16:13.560 --> 16:15.760
This pub on the Borders
in two or three days.

16:15.840 --> 16:17.520
He reckons I'm the man for the job.

16:18.760 --> 16:19.960
Why this one?

16:20.040 --> 16:22.320
Well, it's foreign-owned.
Usual bullshit.

16:23.560 --> 16:26.160
We phone in the warning.
There's not enough time to diffuse.

16:26.240 --> 16:29.120
Localised explosion,
maximum publicity.

16:45.680 --> 16:46.520
No.

16:47.400 --> 16:48.280
No?

16:50.280 --> 16:51.640
It'll give you Temple Laird.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.000
Five attacks this year.

16:53.960 --> 16:56.320
Why did you put me in there
if not for this?

16:56.400 --> 16:58.000
Hey? Two years.

16:58.080 --> 16:59.640
Look, the info is solid.

16:59.720 --> 17:02.520
We're good to go.
Take their head, the body will fall.

17:02.600 --> 17:04.360
Explosives in pubs? I can't risk it.

17:04.440 --> 17:05.720
Two years, all right?

17:05.800 --> 17:08.200
Two years
I've been living in this poison,

17:08.280 --> 17:09.880
telling myself
that it'll be worth it!

17:09.960 --> 17:11.240
Look, have a safe journey back.

17:11.840 --> 17:14.520
Fuck. Look, if I turn Laird down,
I'm out for good.

17:14.600 --> 17:16.480
All right? This is a one-time thing.

17:16.560 --> 17:17.840
I can live with that.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Isla.

17:37.080 --> 17:38.840
Thank you so much
for agreeing to this.

17:38.920 --> 17:40.880
I'm afraid security were adamant
it had to be here.

17:40.960 --> 17:43.520
Not at all.
We'll feel much safer here.

17:43.600 --> 17:47.080
Speaking of safety, would you like
to address that in the debate,

17:47.160 --> 17:48.200
the attack?

17:48.280 --> 17:49.760
Not while
it's under investigation, no.

17:49.840 --> 17:51.480
More than happy
to stick to the referendum.

17:51.560 --> 17:53.840
-OK.
-Great. Shall we take a seat?

18:00.360 --> 18:01.800
You're not going to believe this.

18:07.960 --> 18:10.760
Hey... Oleg Adamov.

18:11.760 --> 18:12.920
What about him?

18:13.000 --> 18:14.880
I looked into his eyes.

18:14.960 --> 18:17.240
There's nothing there. Black holes.

18:19.040 --> 18:21.040
He beat you up. No need to apologise.

18:21.680 --> 18:23.240
No. Do you think I'm scared?

18:23.320 --> 18:24.800
No, no. I want him.

18:25.840 --> 18:28.960
And if you get close to him,
you're gonna need me there with you.

18:32.200 --> 18:34.040
This isn't about revenge.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.280
Isn't it?

18:44.640 --> 18:47.480
<i>Let me take you upstairs and</i>
<i>introduce you to the Home Secretary.</i>

18:47.560 --> 18:49.920
<i>I think you'll find</i>
<i>what he has to say very interesting.</i>

18:50.000 --> 18:51.600
-Has this been verified?
-We're on it.

18:53.320 --> 18:54.440
We need to be sure.

18:54.520 --> 18:56.360
By which time the referendum's lost.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.400
We need to use this now.

19:04.280 --> 19:06.840
Let them deny it.
Let them investigate.

19:06.920 --> 19:08.640
Tie themselves in knots.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.640
Strike now.

19:11.440 --> 19:12.960
Get our country back.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.360
We're looking for Adamov,

19:18.440 --> 19:20.640
riding the VX trails,
checking potential affiliates.

19:20.720 --> 19:22.360
Are you two on the same page now?

19:22.440 --> 19:24.960
Yeah, yeah. The assassination
attempt wasn't Redback,

19:25.040 --> 19:28.080
but the fact that Adamov
was at the radio station

19:28.160 --> 19:29.760
suggests he knows Graham.

19:29.840 --> 19:32.000
I don't get why Shaun Graham
would kill himself.

19:32.080 --> 19:33.960
We don't know that he did.
We need the path report,

19:34.040 --> 19:35.320
so let's stick to what we know.

19:36.160 --> 19:38.640
Yesterday, Nigel Braynor's
phone call, the last one.

19:39.200 --> 19:40.680
-To an unregistered number.
-Yeah.

19:40.760 --> 19:44.080
We've been digging into that. It's
activated once a day for 15 minutes.

19:44.160 --> 19:45.720
Do we have the cell tower data?

19:45.800 --> 19:47.360
We're checking patterns
and crossovers.

19:47.440 --> 19:49.440
So, Braynor
calls an unregistered phone.

19:49.520 --> 19:52.800
Adamov turns up at the radio station.
Braynor calls Adamov?

19:53.600 --> 19:55.600
It's a bit of a leap,
but if he does...

19:55.680 --> 19:58.880
Well, we have an actual trace on the
phone, so soon as he uses it again...

19:58.960 --> 20:01.480
-If it is Adamov...
-Then we'll have his location.

20:01.840 --> 20:05.520
And if it isn't, we'll have someone
with some questions to answer.

20:07.040 --> 20:07.920
Great.

20:19.960 --> 20:21.400
Yesterday was terrifying.

20:23.120 --> 20:24.520
When the lights went out.

20:24.600 --> 20:25.480
It was,

20:26.320 --> 20:27.720
but we're here to tell the tale.

20:28.280 --> 20:31.600
Adam, you know
I won't be pulling any punches.

20:32.800 --> 20:33.600
Of course.

20:33.680 --> 20:35.560
Fifteen seconds to air.
Are we all OK?

20:35.640 --> 20:36.480
Good for me.

20:37.480 --> 20:38.680
Let battle commence.

20:39.320 --> 20:42.160
Five, four, three...

20:44.760 --> 20:47.240
Hello, and welcome to Downing Street

20:47.320 --> 20:50.080
for this important debate
on Scottish independence.

20:50.720 --> 20:52.680
I'm here with the Prime Minister,
Adam Cornwell,

20:53.440 --> 20:55.960
and the leader of the SNP,
Isla Robson.

20:56.800 --> 20:57.600
Prime Minister...

21:00.840 --> 21:02.080
Anything?

21:02.160 --> 21:04.080
-Hey.
-What's in the bag?

21:10.240 --> 21:11.280
Yeah.

21:11.800 --> 21:13.520
We followed the VX residue,
like you said.

21:14.680 --> 21:17.240
Adamov spends a lot of time
in a sex shop in Soho.

21:17.320 --> 21:19.040
-Right.
-We figured we'd buy stuff

21:19.120 --> 21:20.520
while we were there
to make the owners

21:20.600 --> 21:22.160
more conducive to talking to us.

21:22.240 --> 21:23.960
Anyways,
he didn't recognise the photo.

21:24.560 --> 21:27.680
Interesting thing is, the sex shop
is owned by a Russian.

21:29.160 --> 21:30.440
Gavel Surkov.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.280
He has got another property

21:32.360 --> 21:34.080
that has just shown up
a heavy VX residue.

21:34.160 --> 21:35.920
Look, we've got a mobile ping

21:36.000 --> 21:37.720
and your VX residue
at the same place.

21:38.520 --> 21:41.240
That's Gavriil Sergov's club
in Frith Street, isn't it?

21:41.320 --> 21:44.520
So, that unregistered phone
and Adamov were at the same place?

21:44.600 --> 21:46.720
-Shall we check it out?
-No, this is mine.

21:48.160 --> 21:49.360
I'm coming with you.

21:53.360 --> 21:55.720
-One, two...
-Fuck!

21:55.800 --> 21:58.600
Three. Ouch. Thank you.

21:58.680 --> 22:02.320
<i>Prime Minister, what would you say</i>
<i>to those who criticise this decision?</i>

22:02.400 --> 22:03.280
Turn it up!

22:04.400 --> 22:07.880
<i>Well, I'd say that my party</i>
<i>hasn't been given quite the credit</i>

22:07.960 --> 22:11.000
<i>that I think it deserves for granting</i>
<i>Scotland yet another referendum.</i>

22:11.080 --> 22:12.840
Lying bastard!

22:13.680 --> 22:16.360
Explain this 55 percent
bollocks, then!

22:17.400 --> 22:18.600
<i>Many in my party said...</i>

22:18.680 --> 22:20.680
You wouldn't have thought
someone tried to kill him.

22:21.920 --> 22:23.080
<i>I made a promise.</i>

22:23.560 --> 22:25.840
<i>I'm doing my best</i>
<i>to keep this referendum fair</i>

22:26.360 --> 22:27.440
<i>and legitimate.</i>

22:27.960 --> 22:31.200
<i>It's true. Westminster</i>
<i>has neglected Scotland for too long.</i>

22:31.280 --> 22:32.920
<i>But that wasn't under my leadership.</i>

22:33.000 --> 22:36.680
<i>You don't get to dismiss</i>
<i>ten years of Tory rule</i>

22:36.760 --> 22:38.720
<i>just because</i>
<i>you weren't their leader.</i>

22:38.800 --> 22:41.800
<i>I mean, you voted their bills,</i>
<i>you served on...</i>

22:42.640 --> 22:43.640
Do you believe him

22:44.520 --> 22:47.840
when he says he wants Scotland
to remain in the union?

22:48.480 --> 22:50.520
Yes, absolutely.

22:51.960 --> 22:53.560
But in the distance between

22:54.560 --> 22:56.160
what a man says

22:56.240 --> 22:58.360
and what a man does

22:59.560 --> 23:02.640
is a wasteland
where angels fear to tread.

23:04.640 --> 23:07.040
Which is why
it's populated by devils.

23:07.120 --> 23:09.320
If we let the devils run wild,

23:10.320 --> 23:11.600
what hope is there?

23:14.120 --> 23:15.320
Pleasure talking to you.

23:16.840 --> 23:18.040
Is that what we were doing?

23:18.640 --> 23:22.720
Do keep him in line, would you?
So that I don't have to.

23:26.280 --> 23:27.280
Sorry.

23:55.560 --> 23:57.160
We're looking for this man.

24:00.640 --> 24:03.840
You'd better pray to find him.

24:04.720 --> 24:08.840
Are you protecting men
who beat women?

24:11.640 --> 24:13.560
It depends on the women.

24:14.360 --> 24:16.720
We're not leaving without some
answers. He killed my friend.

24:16.800 --> 24:18.240
He tried to kill her, too.

24:18.320 --> 24:19.600
I am sorry he failed.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.960
-Maybe I'll do better.
-Sergei.

24:24.520 --> 24:26.120
Where are your manners?

24:27.760 --> 24:30.960
Sorry. Raised by bears. Please.

24:48.760 --> 24:49.880
Nice little place.

24:52.160 --> 24:54.480
I'm looking
for bigger premises, actually.

24:56.960 --> 24:58.680
Have you seen this man?

25:01.040 --> 25:02.560
Compatriot of yours?

25:04.640 --> 25:06.800
Before I answer anything, some ID.

25:13.400 --> 25:14.640
Ogilvy.

25:15.840 --> 25:17.640
A good old Scottish name.

25:18.400 --> 25:20.120
Yet you look like a No vote to me.

25:22.520 --> 25:23.320
Poulsen.

25:24.920 --> 25:26.200
Classic Dane.

25:27.400 --> 25:28.800
And you're Gavel Surkov.

25:28.880 --> 25:31.560
Property developer, owner
of several clubs, shares in Arsenal.

25:32.280 --> 25:35.400
You were also Gregorovitch's protégé.
One of the original oligarchs.

25:35.480 --> 25:36.840
You somehow
ended up with his billions,

25:36.920 --> 25:38.840
while he was found dead
in bulletproof car.

25:38.920 --> 25:41.280
And now here you are
hiding out in London.

25:41.960 --> 25:44.120
Shares in Arsenal
is hardly hiding out.

25:45.120 --> 25:46.760
So, now we all know each other...

25:46.840 --> 25:49.720
Oleg Adamov. Do you know him?

25:50.960 --> 25:51.960
Never seen him.

25:58.480 --> 26:00.160
There are plenty of cameras here.

26:00.680 --> 26:02.440
We'll just take a look
at your footage.

26:03.040 --> 26:04.840
Come back with the paperwork.

26:08.480 --> 26:09.760
One more thing, though.

26:12.160 --> 26:14.320
Careful what you find
when turning over rocks.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.520
<i>We can all agree</i>
<i>it's been a really tough few days</i>

26:26.600 --> 26:28.000
<i>for the Prime Minister,</i>

26:28.080 --> 26:30.320
<i>finding himself</i>
<i>on the front pages of the tabloids...</i>

26:30.400 --> 26:32.120
<i>There's nothing more</i>
<i>I'd like to say on that.</i>

26:32.200 --> 26:33.720
<i>Then there was yesterday's</i>
<i>shocking events.</i>

26:33.800 --> 26:37.360
<i>Everybody here now has been</i>
<i>traumatised by what happened.</i>

26:37.440 --> 26:38.960
<i>My sympathy goes out to you</i>

26:39.040 --> 26:42.320
<i>and to the families</i>
<i>of the men who fell protecting you.</i>

26:42.400 --> 26:43.200
<i>Thank you.</i>

26:43.680 --> 26:47.800
However, we are here
to debate the referendum.

26:47.880 --> 26:50.440
You were offered a chance
to postpone, so

26:51.240 --> 26:52.160
if you're OK,

26:52.720 --> 26:54.720
I've got a few tough questions
for you.

26:55.520 --> 26:56.800
I'd expect nothing less.

26:57.600 --> 27:01.440
We're in Downing Street
for security reasons. I get that.

27:02.000 --> 27:06.360
But it gives you the home-ground
advantage, as it were.

27:06.440 --> 27:11.080
So, can you explain why you need
another even bigger advantage?

27:11.160 --> 27:14.040
The 55 percent you're demanding.

27:14.120 --> 27:17.200
You're always saying that Scotland
and England are better off together,

27:17.280 --> 27:19.320
so why not a level playing field?

27:19.400 --> 27:22.920
Well, firstly,
it's not just Scotland and England.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.960
It's the United Kingdom as a whole.

27:25.840 --> 27:28.400
Over 300 years as a single country.

27:28.480 --> 27:31.600
We have a common culture,
a common heritage.

27:32.200 --> 27:33.200
And, secondly,

27:34.120 --> 27:36.000
the 55 percent requirement

27:36.600 --> 27:38.560
gives democracy the advantage.

27:38.640 --> 27:40.240
<i>Look at the European referendum.</i>

27:40.320 --> 27:43.200
<i>It went through by a whisker,</i>
<i>and then Parliament...</i>

27:43.280 --> 27:44.520
-Nonse!
<i>-...the entire country...</i>

27:44.600 --> 27:46.720
Try listening! It might make sense.

27:46.800 --> 27:48.200
<i>...the next three years in disarray.</i>

27:48.280 --> 27:49.880
Think you're in the wrong pub, doll.

27:49.960 --> 27:51.600
Tommy! Settle down!

27:52.520 --> 27:54.600
<i>...the other calling them out</i>
<i>for being sore losers.</i>

27:54.680 --> 27:56.400
<i>I don't want that to happen here.</i>

27:56.480 --> 27:58.440
<i>If there is a will for change...</i>

27:58.880 --> 28:00.600
Why are you so defensive of that man?

28:00.680 --> 28:02.480
There is a will, Prime Minister.

28:13.200 --> 28:14.000
I think...

28:15.480 --> 28:17.160
I think he might be my dad.

28:18.440 --> 28:19.320
What?

28:20.160 --> 28:24.000
We're getting a test done,
but we both want it to be.

28:25.080 --> 28:26.120
I think.

28:27.640 --> 28:28.640
Wow.

28:30.560 --> 28:32.160
You can't tell anyone.

28:34.320 --> 28:35.880
-OK.
-I just

28:35.960 --> 28:38.560
don't want this coming out
until I know for absolute sure.

28:38.640 --> 28:40.960
It's just been really shit
since Mum...

28:41.720 --> 28:42.920
Just want something to go right.

28:53.760 --> 28:55.720
You're not watching your boy.

28:56.200 --> 28:58.000
He's about
to get his arse handed to him.

28:58.080 --> 28:59.760
I think he's doing just fine.

29:00.440 --> 29:01.600
You don't get it.

29:02.960 --> 29:04.480
We've got footage,

29:05.240 --> 29:07.200
and it's going out live
to the nation.

29:08.920 --> 29:11.480
<i>Lay the proud usurpers low</i>

29:11.560 --> 29:13.960
<i>Tyrants fall in every foe</i>

29:14.040 --> 29:16.640
<i>Liberty's in every blow</i>

29:16.720 --> 29:18.760
<i>Let us do or die</i>

29:20.760 --> 29:24.560
And, yet, here we are,
exactly where you want to be.

29:25.280 --> 29:30.160
If there is a will, let Scotland
prove it by a determined majority.

29:30.240 --> 29:33.640
Because you're all about Scotland,
Prime Minister.

29:34.200 --> 29:36.800
I know that we're both
the weaker for it, if we split.

29:36.880 --> 29:39.680
I can definitively prove
that won't be the case,

29:40.240 --> 29:43.120
that staying in the union
will leave us the poorer for it.

29:43.560 --> 29:47.840
In fact, I can show you right now.

29:53.160 --> 29:53.960
Sorry. What's going on?

29:54.040 --> 29:58.000
I'm being told we have
some important footage to watch.

29:58.080 --> 30:00.120
Could we get a monitor
for the PM, please?

30:01.560 --> 30:06.120
So, um, what is this
that we're about to watch?

30:06.200 --> 30:08.560
We've heard a lot
from the Prime Minister

30:08.640 --> 30:10.760
about how much he values Scotland.

30:11.720 --> 30:15.640
When what he really means
is how much he values our oil.

30:16.080 --> 30:17.520
That's not true.

30:17.600 --> 30:20.480
Only he doesn't think
it's Scotland's oil.

30:20.560 --> 30:21.800
He thinks it's his.

30:21.880 --> 30:24.000
<i>And he thinks he can sell it</i>
<i>behind our backs.</i>

30:24.080 --> 30:25.680
<i>That's completely ridiculous.</i>

30:25.760 --> 30:28.200
What you're about to see
is camera footage

30:28.280 --> 30:29.560
of Mr. Cornwell here

30:29.640 --> 30:31.160
in an undisclosed meeting

30:31.240 --> 30:33.400
with representatives
from Petro China.

30:34.680 --> 30:36.280
<i>As soon as we've won the referendum,</i>

30:36.360 --> 30:39.360
<i>I will of course renegotiate</i>
<i>the Continental Shelf Act.</i>

30:39.960 --> 30:42.640
<i>I mean, it's obvious.</i>
<i>Scotland's share of the oil revenue</i>

30:42.720 --> 30:44.400
<i>has been far too high</i>
<i>for far too long.</i>

30:47.920 --> 30:50.320
<i>Let me take you upstairs,</i>
<i>introduce you to the Home Secretary.</i>

30:50.400 --> 30:52.200
-That's not me.
-Certainly looks like you.

30:52.280 --> 30:53.720
It's a fake. That's a fake.

30:53.800 --> 30:55.080
It's a fake! Listen to him.

30:55.160 --> 30:55.960
Twat!

30:56.440 --> 30:58.360
That's a very convenient thing
to say, Prime Minister.

30:58.440 --> 31:00.680
No, it's not convenient, it's
the truth. That's a deep-fake video.

31:00.760 --> 31:02.400
Fine. I look forward
to seeing your proof.

31:02.480 --> 31:04.880
I've listened! I've heard him!

31:07.280 --> 31:09.280
-I believe...
-Do you have any proof?

31:20.800 --> 31:22.480
Stop it!

31:22.560 --> 31:23.960
-Weird.
-Well, I think we seem

31:24.040 --> 31:25.760
to be running out of time here

31:25.840 --> 31:28.280
but you can keep up-to-date
with the debate

31:28.360 --> 31:30.760
on our news 24 channel.

31:30.840 --> 31:34.120
In the meantime,
I'd like to thank the Prime Minister

31:34.200 --> 31:38.120
and the leader of the SNP
for being here with us today.

31:48.920 --> 31:52.560
Back off! Back off! Back... Back...

31:52.640 --> 31:55.000
-Who's the daddy?
-You are one sick...

31:55.080 --> 31:56.280
Who's the daddy?

32:00.760 --> 32:01.960
Adamov's using his phone.

32:06.280 --> 32:08.120
All right. Text me his location.

32:09.200 --> 32:11.720
You got a ping of his phone?
Where is Adamov?

32:11.800 --> 32:13.080
Go back to the office.

32:13.160 --> 32:14.440
-Don't be insane!
-Look.

32:14.520 --> 32:15.320
You need me there.

32:15.400 --> 32:17.400
I want him in cuffs, not a body bag.

32:17.480 --> 32:19.200
You can't do this on your own.
Come on.

32:20.120 --> 32:21.240
-Get out!
-No!

32:21.320 --> 32:23.760
Get out or we lose him.
And that's on you.

32:34.880 --> 32:37.400
He's called an unregistered mobile.
Probably a burner phone.

32:37.480 --> 32:39.520
I'm not getting anything
on either numbers.

32:39.600 --> 32:41.800
I want backup out there right now!

32:42.680 --> 32:44.520
No agent gets left in the breeze.

32:53.520 --> 32:55.400
Have you seen this guy?

32:56.120 --> 32:57.280
No.

33:11.400 --> 33:13.720
Stop! Put your hands on your head!

33:17.000 --> 33:18.080
She has a gun!

33:22.560 --> 33:23.920
Fuck!

33:28.000 --> 33:28.960
Mind out!

33:29.560 --> 33:30.680
Move!

33:33.960 --> 33:34.840
Move!

33:41.160 --> 33:43.840
Stop! Drop the gun. Now! Do it!

33:56.440 --> 33:57.600
Go.

34:06.360 --> 34:07.640
You want to search me.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.080
Take your clothes off.

34:14.840 --> 34:15.760
What?

34:15.840 --> 34:17.200
Go on. Do it. Now.

34:30.440 --> 34:31.520
What is Redback?

34:36.680 --> 34:38.080
How do you know Shaun Graham?

34:39.160 --> 34:40.240
Who?

34:43.800 --> 34:45.480
The assassin at the radio station.

34:46.960 --> 34:47.800
Oh, him?

34:49.120 --> 34:51.040
Not my man. Maybe yours.

34:51.760 --> 34:52.560
Who knows?

34:53.720 --> 34:55.040
Who do you work for?

34:55.120 --> 34:56.120
Whoever pays.

34:58.360 --> 34:59.560
But you're GRU?

35:00.160 --> 35:01.200
No.

35:02.920 --> 35:03.920
Chaos Agent.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.080
Putin's puppet.

35:07.800 --> 35:09.120
You fucking children!

35:09.840 --> 35:10.920
You have nothing.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.200
Because we are nothing.

35:13.360 --> 35:14.280
We are no one.

35:15.120 --> 35:16.400
And yet we are everywhere.

35:20.080 --> 35:21.120
Everything. Off.

35:25.400 --> 35:26.800
We fight different wars.

35:28.200 --> 35:29.640
You have rules

35:30.200 --> 35:31.600
and that's why you will lose.

35:35.560 --> 35:37.440
Is this that you want?

35:46.240 --> 35:47.560
I think I'll go now.

35:47.640 --> 35:49.080
-Stay there.
-Or what?

35:49.920 --> 35:51.920
Drop your gun or I'll drop this.

35:52.600 --> 35:53.560
The choice is yours.

35:59.480 --> 36:01.240
-So be it.
-No! Don't!

36:01.920 --> 36:03.000
Lower your gun.

36:07.320 --> 36:09.840
Do it! Do it!

36:36.000 --> 36:37.280
Fuck!

36:39.880 --> 36:40.840
Shit.

36:54.560 --> 36:55.560
Fucking...

36:56.720 --> 36:57.680
Fuck!

37:09.360 --> 37:10.200
Jesus.

37:11.600 --> 37:12.600
I'll get some more.

37:17.360 --> 37:21.920
If you need me to call you a cab,
so you can leave before he does...

37:22.000 --> 37:24.360
No. He was defending me.

37:25.400 --> 37:26.680
Maybe they're not all bad.

37:27.200 --> 37:28.040
Men?

37:28.640 --> 37:29.600
Journalists.

37:32.120 --> 37:33.560
Works for the <i>Scottish Sun.</i>

37:35.720 --> 37:36.680
Yeah?

37:38.360 --> 37:40.400
<i>Tell me you got something. Anything.</i>

37:40.480 --> 37:41.520
I got a sick note.

37:42.720 --> 37:44.160
-I won't be in tomorrow.
<i>-What?</i>

37:45.840 --> 37:47.480
And then I won't be in at all.

37:47.560 --> 37:49.080
<i>Are you fucking kidding...</i>

37:52.600 --> 37:53.600
Just reporting in?

37:54.920 --> 37:55.760
I'm sorry.

37:58.560 --> 37:59.960
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

38:03.040 --> 38:05.200
First time since Mum I wasn't
thinking about her.

38:08.480 --> 38:09.840
Except it wasn't real.

38:09.920 --> 38:13.200
You're just another bloke
who's full of shit.

38:15.920 --> 38:17.160
I'm sorry, Holly.

38:23.360 --> 38:24.400
<i>I mean, it's obvious.</i>

38:24.480 --> 38:26.040
<i>Scotland's share of the oil revenues</i>

38:26.120 --> 38:28.120
<i>has been far too high</i>
<i>for far too long.</i>

38:28.840 --> 38:30.080
I should have been there.

38:30.160 --> 38:32.080
<i>-Let me take you upstairs...</i>
-Nothing you could have done.

38:33.040 --> 38:35.760
This isn't even
about politics anymore.

38:36.720 --> 38:38.440
Cornwell, it's a blizzard of lies.

38:41.480 --> 38:43.040
Nicky's run some numbers.

38:44.840 --> 38:46.520
Predicted rise in the Yes vote.

38:51.040 --> 38:53.600
How do I tell people it's a fake
when the more I say it,

38:53.680 --> 38:56.160
the more convinced
they become that it's true.

39:05.840 --> 39:07.560
This could cost us the union.

39:22.280 --> 39:23.720
He was right there.

39:24.360 --> 39:26.000
Mother and baby, Beatrice.

39:28.280 --> 39:30.920
What did he mean
Shaun Graham may be one of ours?

39:32.320 --> 39:35.440
"We are nothing. We have nothing.
We are everywhere."

39:39.040 --> 39:40.120
Fuck!

39:40.200 --> 39:41.240
I had him.

39:43.480 --> 39:44.600
I...

39:45.080 --> 39:45.920
Well...

39:51.680 --> 39:54.440
We keep our agents
on a very tight leash

39:56.000 --> 39:58.080
because we play by the rules.

40:21.160 --> 40:24.200
Do you think that I would have
let him turn around and walk out?

40:24.280 --> 40:25.080
Do you?

40:25.840 --> 40:27.480
You should have taken me with you.

40:31.880 --> 40:33.280
As it comes?

40:33.960 --> 40:34.800
'Course.

40:38.880 --> 40:40.320
Found a body this morning.

40:41.320 --> 40:45.000
Forensics say he'd been holding
a gun in his right hand.

40:45.080 --> 40:49.080
We had the pathologist's report.
They say his right wrist was snapped.

40:49.160 --> 40:50.240
What kind of break?

40:50.320 --> 40:51.640
A Barton's fracture.

40:51.720 --> 40:53.520
Dislocation
of the radio-carpal joint.

40:53.600 --> 40:55.360
Well, someone knew
what they were doing.

40:55.440 --> 40:58.040
So, show me. I'm holding the gun.

41:00.480 --> 41:01.400
Turn round.

41:04.000 --> 41:09.080
Right. Using maximum force,
you grab, twist, snap the wrist.

41:09.640 --> 41:10.760
Gun is yours.

41:11.560 --> 41:12.560
Simple.

41:14.360 --> 41:16.720
You are talking about the guy
who tried to kill the PM, yeah?

41:16.800 --> 41:17.760
I am.

41:19.360 --> 41:20.480
Shame he failed.

41:21.280 --> 41:22.480
Who was the hero?

41:22.560 --> 41:23.400
Russian.

41:25.960 --> 41:26.840
Oleg Adamov.

41:29.960 --> 41:31.880
Why would he wanna save
Cornwell's life?

41:31.960 --> 41:33.000
Wrong question.

41:34.040 --> 41:37.480
The real question is what would
the death of Adam Cornwell change?

42:06.640 --> 42:07.440
What's this for?

42:09.360 --> 42:10.480
Tell Laird it's on.

42:44.440 --> 42:47.280
Temple Laird,
Scottish nationalist terrorist.

42:47.360 --> 42:50.080
We believe that Laird
is funded by Russian money.

42:50.160 --> 42:51.560
No more diversions.

42:51.640 --> 42:54.280
Tattoo Redback

42:54.360 --> 42:57.200
on your eyeballs.

42:57.280 --> 42:59.600
Are you gonna OK
this operation or not?

42:59.680 --> 43:00.880
I don't trust your agent.

43:00.960 --> 43:02.160
I don't trust you.

43:02.240 --> 43:04.480
I should kill the referendum. Resign.

43:04.560 --> 43:05.360
No.

43:05.440 --> 43:07.320
Mr. Ogilvy thinks
it's the best option.

43:07.400 --> 43:08.760
I think it's the only option.

43:08.840 --> 43:09.960
I didn't agree to this!

43:10.040 --> 43:13.760
And I didn't agree to you planting
a bomb in a pub, but here we are.

43:14.240 --> 43:15.400
Fucking spy.

43:15.480 --> 43:17.680
Infiltrator. Nothing worse.

43:17.760 --> 43:19.800
Adam's taking a massive risk.

43:19.880 --> 43:22.160
The referendum's
going to be a digital vote.

43:22.240 --> 43:25.200
I know people
who can tweak the results.

43:25.280 --> 43:28.560
I made a professional judgement
and then you got Daddy to intervene!

43:29.160 --> 43:31.600
Ever wonder where you would be
if it wasn't for your father?

43:31.680 --> 43:32.720
Independence.

43:32.800 --> 43:35.080
People think it's about politics.

43:36.160 --> 43:37.160
It's about blood.

43:37.240 --> 43:39.640
<i>This is an unmitigated</i>
<i>fuck-up, Beatrice!</i>

43:40.160 --> 43:41.440
This could bring us all down!

43:42.320 --> 43:44.280
