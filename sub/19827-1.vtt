WEBVTT

00:00.016 --> 00:02.951
Life. It's literally all we have.

00:02.976 --> 00:03.985
But is it any good? I'm a reviewer.

00:03.987 --> 00:08.006
But I don't review
food, books or movies.

00:08.031 --> 00:10.468
I review life itself.

00:11.401 --> 00:13.434
Aah!

00:14.064 --> 00:16.097
Aah!

00:18.000 --> 00:24.074

00:25.341 --> 00:26.774
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,

00:27.069 --> 00:29.380
to the third season of "Review."

00:29.405 --> 00:31.351
I am Forrest MacNeil.

00:31.461 --> 00:34.476
Whatever life experience you're
curious about, I will do it.

00:34.731 --> 00:36.798
And then I will review it.

00:36.800 --> 00:39.801
I am thrilled to be back
and delighted to be reunited

00:39.803 --> 00:41.736
with my co-host, A.J. Gibbs!

00:41.738 --> 00:43.238
- Forrest...
- Yes!

00:43.240 --> 00:44.572
... you're alive!

00:44.574 --> 00:46.341
I know!

00:46.343 --> 00:47.742
And it is incredible.

00:47.744 --> 00:50.945
Returning viewers will recall
that our last season ended

00:50.947 --> 00:53.081
rather abruptly when my producer, Grant,

00:53.083 --> 00:56.751
and I very unfortunately
fell off of a high bridge.

00:56.753 --> 00:58.920
If I'm gonna die, you're gonna die, too!

01:01.591 --> 01:03.091
[Bleep]

01:03.093 --> 01:05.126
Grant and I both survived.

01:05.128 --> 01:09.864
And that is, without a doubt, a miracle.

01:09.866 --> 01:12.834
There's just no other
way to understand it.

01:12.836 --> 01:14.435
I believe I am alive today

01:14.437 --> 01:16.304
so that I can continue to do

01:16.306 --> 01:19.841
this extraordinarily important work.

01:19.843 --> 01:22.777
And so with that, A.J.,
what is my first...

01:22.779 --> 01:26.151
Oh, wait, you forgot to tell
them about the veto booth.

01:26.176 --> 01:28.550
Yes, I did. That's true.

01:28.552 --> 01:31.452
Last season, I was able
to veto two reviews.

01:31.454 --> 01:33.555
And this season, our
lawyers have insisted

01:33.557 --> 01:35.890
that I have unlimited vetoes.

01:38.628 --> 01:40.962
Signified by that eternal flame

01:40.964 --> 01:42.997
and all those stacks of vetoes.

01:42.999 --> 01:45.300
But I swear to you
now that I will not use

01:45.302 --> 01:47.335
any vetoes ever again.

01:47.337 --> 01:50.805
You want guidance on the
vital questions of our time.

01:50.807 --> 01:52.807
If the universe, through
our random system,

01:52.809 --> 01:54.142
chooses your request,

01:54.144 --> 01:56.044
who am I to stand in its way?

01:56.046 --> 01:58.980
There will be no vetoes.

01:58.982 --> 02:00.415
Now, A.J., let's get to it!

02:00.417 --> 02:03.251
What is my first review of season three?

02:03.253 --> 02:04.752
Okay.

02:04.754 --> 02:07.622
It comes from Pete in
Westchester, California.

02:07.624 --> 02:08.990
- Pete?
- Yeah.

02:08.991 --> 02:11.259
Hello. I'm Pete from
the viral marketing team

02:11.261 --> 02:12.994
here at Neato Taquitos.

02:12.996 --> 02:15.496
Forrest, our question to you is,

02:15.498 --> 02:19.234
what's it like to try
our brand new Locorito?

02:19.236 --> 02:23.338
- Neato Taquitos...
- We made it, you eat it.

02:27.577 --> 02:29.911
The vital questions of our time.

02:29.913 --> 02:32.013
Hmm. I believe this may

02:32.015 --> 02:34.349
turn out to be one of those.

02:34.351 --> 02:36.150
And, therefore,

02:36.152 --> 02:38.720
a perfect example of the work

02:38.722 --> 02:41.789
that my life was spared to do.

02:41.791 --> 02:43.925
- Here I go.
- Yum.

02:45.795 --> 02:48.763
Buying and eating a
fast-food burrito sounded

02:48.765 --> 02:50.031
like a very short review.

02:50.033 --> 02:52.533
But when I arrived at Neato Taquitos,

02:52.535 --> 02:53.972
it did not look that way.

02:53.997 --> 02:55.270
Oh, no.

02:55.272 --> 02:57.372
Apparently, Pete had
recorded his question

02:57.374 --> 02:59.374
during the months that
my producer, Grant,

02:59.376 --> 03:01.209
and I were lost in the wilderness.

03:01.211 --> 03:04.212
Since then, it appeared that
the entire Neato Taquitos

03:04.214 --> 03:08.049
fast-food chain had
gone out of business.

03:08.051 --> 03:09.550
My interns, Josh and Tina,

03:09.552 --> 03:14.322
suggested placing an ad
on wwww.craigslist.com

03:14.324 --> 03:15.723
to find a Locorito,

03:15.725 --> 03:17.225
which I now understood had

03:17.227 --> 03:19.494
been out of production for 6 months.

03:19.496 --> 03:20.662
Read it back to me, please.

03:20.664 --> 03:23.231
"Wanted one Locorito
from Neato Taquitos."

03:23.233 --> 03:24.565
Will pay $5.

03:24.567 --> 03:26.768
"Open to paying less.
Serious inquiries only."

03:26.770 --> 03:28.636
Do you think that's gonna work?

03:28.638 --> 03:31.406
Honestly, you never know.
People sell weird [bleep].

03:31.408 --> 03:33.808
Vulgarities aside, Tina was right.

03:33.810 --> 03:36.110
I was astonished to eventually receive

03:36.112 --> 03:37.551
a response to my request...

03:37.576 --> 03:38.946
Who is it?

03:38.948 --> 03:40.548
Uh, Craig sent me.

03:40.550 --> 03:42.150
It's about the Locorito.

03:42.152 --> 03:43.918
... from a man who hung on

03:43.920 --> 03:46.754
to a burrito from a
defunct chain restaurant

03:46.756 --> 03:49.657
because he also hangs
on to everything, always.

03:49.659 --> 03:52.360
I managed to save everything
except my marriage.

03:52.362 --> 03:53.995
Oh, yeah. Divorce can be difficult.

03:53.997 --> 03:55.430
But sometimes it's for the best.

03:55.432 --> 03:58.099
Worst mistake I ever
made. Ruined my life.

03:58.101 --> 03:59.400
Okay.

03:59.402 --> 04:02.370
This simple request had
become a test of my patience.

04:02.372 --> 04:03.752
Can I move some of this stuff?

04:03.777 --> 04:06.140
No! Oh, there it is.

04:06.142 --> 04:08.643
I'd hate to let her go.

04:11.014 --> 04:13.448
I left that house with
a profound appreciation

04:13.450 --> 04:15.450
for whatever mental illness allowed me

04:15.452 --> 04:16.684
to complete my mission.

04:16.685 --> 04:18.653
Hey! Can I interest you

04:18.654 --> 04:20.988
in a discontinued Starbucks muffin?

04:20.990 --> 04:23.358
No, just the Locorito. Thank you.

04:23.360 --> 04:24.559
Your loss.

04:25.895 --> 04:27.595
Oh.

04:27.597 --> 04:29.664
Ever since my return to civilization,

04:29.666 --> 04:32.533
I have been living in the
home of my producer, Grant...

04:32.535 --> 04:33.634
After you.

04:33.636 --> 04:35.403
... who, I am very sorry to say

04:35.405 --> 04:37.505
took the brunt of our
impact on the water

04:37.507 --> 04:39.574
and is now paralyzed
from the waist down.

04:39.576 --> 04:40.775
Ah.

04:40.777 --> 04:42.577
This was an ideal arrangement.

04:42.579 --> 04:44.445
- You found your food.
- Yes, I did.

04:44.447 --> 04:47.181
Living with a colleague meant
no distractions from "Review."

04:47.183 --> 04:49.517
- Oxycodone and blood thinner.
- Thank you.

04:49.519 --> 04:52.320
This work is all that I need in my life.

04:52.322 --> 04:53.821
You know, it might help you

04:53.823 --> 04:55.823
to focus better on that experience

04:55.825 --> 04:58.359
if you ate it away from my own meal.

05:00.363 --> 05:02.072
Yes.

05:02.850 --> 05:04.236
I don't know that I've ever eaten food

05:04.261 --> 05:07.896
this far past the date
that it was prepared.

05:08.114 --> 05:09.857
Here goes.

05:11.241 --> 05:12.840
Okay.

05:12.842 --> 05:14.942
This was not the first time fate had

05:14.944 --> 05:17.011
caused me to eat something unsound.

05:17.013 --> 05:20.681
But it was, by far, the most
revolting meal of my life.

05:20.683 --> 05:22.183
That'd be some kind of a mold.

05:22.185 --> 05:25.353
By the time I had successfully
choked down the burrito,

05:25.355 --> 05:27.021
I longed for the raw birds

05:27.023 --> 05:29.157
I'd consumed when I was lost at sea

05:29.159 --> 05:30.625
and the animal droppings Grant

05:30.627 --> 05:32.894
and I lived on after
we accidentally fell

05:32.896 --> 05:34.962
from the bridge and were
living in the wilderness,

05:34.964 --> 05:36.497
fighting for our lives.

05:36.499 --> 05:39.133
This burrito was a
terrible thing to eat.

05:39.135 --> 05:42.470
And my body knew instantly
that something was very wrong.

05:42.472 --> 05:46.207
Ohh. A war raged within my stomach.

05:46.209 --> 05:49.043
Oh, God. Ah!

05:49.045 --> 05:51.913
Ohh.

05:52.549 --> 05:54.415
Oh, [bleep]. Ohh.

05:54.417 --> 05:55.883
It was a night spent

05:55.885 --> 05:58.085
in terrible burrito-induced agony.

05:58.087 --> 05:59.387
Oh.

05:59.389 --> 06:00.922
Shouldn't have eaten that burrito.

06:00.924 --> 06:03.035
It was the only one I could find.

06:03.060 --> 06:05.159
Even so.

06:05.161 --> 06:07.228
[Stomach rumbles] What
the [bleep] is that?

06:07.230 --> 06:11.466
Oh.

06:11.468 --> 06:12.900
[Bleep]

06:12.902 --> 06:15.803
Oh, [bleep]. Oh, [bleep].

06:15.805 --> 06:17.839
Oh, [bleep].

06:22.078 --> 06:23.911
Yes, hello?

06:23.913 --> 06:25.279
No, no, no.

06:25.281 --> 06:27.548
No.

06:27.550 --> 06:29.083
I had forgotten that this was

06:29.085 --> 06:30.952
a crucial day in my murder trial,

06:30.954 --> 06:33.020
which resulted from last season's review

06:33.022 --> 06:34.288
of killing a person...

06:34.290 --> 06:36.023
Oh!

06:36.025 --> 06:39.260
In which a person was killed.

06:39.262 --> 06:40.995
Why didn't you give me
more warning about this?

06:40.997 --> 06:42.930
I'm so sorry. I just started golfing.

06:42.932 --> 06:45.566
And it's taken over my life.

06:45.568 --> 06:47.134
Listen, I don't feel very well.

06:47.136 --> 06:48.603
You've got to get it together, Forrest.

06:48.605 --> 06:50.271
This is jury selection.

06:50.273 --> 06:52.106
12 of these people are going to decide

06:52.108 --> 06:54.041
if you're a murderer
or a self-defenser.

06:54.043 --> 06:55.776
So you've got to make a good impression.

06:55.778 --> 06:57.445
Oh, yeah. I'll do my best.

06:57.447 --> 06:59.814
All rise.

06:59.816 --> 07:01.782
Getting a Locorito into my body

07:01.784 --> 07:04.151
had been a surprisingly difficult task.

07:04.153 --> 07:06.921
But getting it out was far
too easy for anyone's comfort.

07:06.923 --> 07:09.824
Oh, my God. Ohh. He number two'd!

07:09.826 --> 07:12.793
- Ew! Ohh.
- I can explain.

07:12.795 --> 07:14.428
Oh, no, no, no, no.
You can't talk to them.

07:14.430 --> 07:15.963
Ladies and gentlemen, yesterday,

07:15.965 --> 07:18.676
I ate a 6-month-old burrito.

07:18.701 --> 07:19.754
And...

07:19.779 --> 07:21.712
Oh! Oh!

07:26.009 --> 07:28.342
I move that that be
stricken from the record.

07:28.344 --> 07:31.679
Considering the many miseries
that the Locorito brought me,

07:31.681 --> 07:35.983
it's no wonder Neato Taquitos
is no longer in business.

07:35.985 --> 07:37.585
An inauspicious beginning

07:37.587 --> 07:40.154
to a rather serious legal
proceeding, I'm afraid.

07:40.156 --> 07:43.090
But also an illuminating
start to our new season.

07:43.092 --> 07:46.060
That rancid fast-food
burrito brought me to a simple

07:46.062 --> 07:48.195
but important life lesson.

07:48.197 --> 07:51.599
It is better to let go of
the past than to eat it.

07:51.601 --> 07:56.771
I give eating the new Locorito
from Neato Taquitos one star.

08:04.226 --> 08:05.959
What's next, A.J.?

08:05.961 --> 08:09.896
It comes from 9-year-old
Anastasia in Ryegate, Montana.

08:09.898 --> 08:12.065
- Delightful.
- Anastasia writes,

08:12.067 --> 08:14.200
- "I want to get a puppy"...
- Aw.

08:14.202 --> 08:17.037
"... but my mom says we can't
because we already have a dog.

08:17.039 --> 08:19.339
What's it like to put a pet to sleep?"

08:19.341 --> 08:21.474
Oh. Oh, boy.

08:21.476 --> 08:24.544
You know, Forrest, you could
just sing a lullaby to a cat.

08:24.546 --> 08:26.279
Mmm. I could do that,

08:26.281 --> 08:28.381
but then I would also
have to kill it somehow,

08:28.383 --> 08:30.550
because that's what Anastasia wants.

08:30.552 --> 08:35.522
I'm off to put a pet
to sleep, meaning death.

08:38.126 --> 08:40.592
The only pet I've ever
had was a golden retriever

08:40.595 --> 08:43.730
that I acquired for my family
in my review of stealing.

08:43.732 --> 08:46.266
- Okay.
- His name was Sergeant.

08:46.268 --> 08:48.735
And there was no way of
knowing how old he was.

08:48.737 --> 08:50.971
If he had fallen ill,
I would not have known

08:50.973 --> 08:52.405
because my ex-wife, Suzanne,

08:52.407 --> 08:54.174
did not allow me into the new home

08:54.176 --> 08:56.176
she and our son live
in. What do you want?

08:56.178 --> 08:58.278
But if I was going
to put a pet to sleep,

08:58.280 --> 09:00.413
Sergeant was the logical place to start.

09:00.415 --> 09:02.582
I'm just seeing how things are going.

09:02.584 --> 09:05.285
I've b... I've been, uh,
thinking about the dog lately.

09:05.287 --> 09:08.421
- What's the review?
- What's the review?

09:08.423 --> 09:12.759
What is it, like, "What's it
like to be a veterinarian"?

09:12.761 --> 09:14.160
No.

09:14.162 --> 09:16.429
I not even saying for
sure that this is a review.

09:16.431 --> 09:18.331
Well, you're not getting
anywhere near the dog.

09:18.333 --> 09:19.073
Good-bye.

09:19.098 --> 09:22.102
It appeared I would not be
putting my old dog to sleep.

09:22.104 --> 09:24.404
But Suzanne's reference
to veterinary medicine

09:24.406 --> 09:26.439
gave me a good idea.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.244
Hi.

09:33.615 --> 09:35.909
Is your cat dying?

09:36.651 --> 09:38.718
Well, if the doctor says that
there's nothing you can do

09:38.720 --> 09:40.420
for the bee sting,

09:40.422 --> 09:43.723
I would be happy to
put him down for you.

09:43.725 --> 09:47.694
This approach was
also proving difficult.

09:47.696 --> 09:49.329
But just as I was ready to give up

09:49.331 --> 09:50.730
on the veterinary hospital

09:50.732 --> 09:53.566
and go out in search of
a critically injured bird,

09:53.568 --> 09:56.136
this story took an exotic turn.

09:56.138 --> 09:58.004
Wow. What is that?

09:58.006 --> 10:00.640
- It's a bearded dragon.
- What's wrong with him?

10:00.642 --> 10:03.209
It's old. He hasn't been eating.

10:03.211 --> 10:06.713
Might just be time to
put him out of his misery.

10:06.715 --> 10:09.516
Really?

10:09.518 --> 10:12.519
I have nothing to do
for the rest of the day.

10:12.521 --> 10:14.387
And I would be more than happy

10:14.389 --> 10:16.322
to help this little fellow

10:16.324 --> 10:18.591
over to the other side for you.

10:18.593 --> 10:20.527
Why put yourself through that pain?

10:20.529 --> 10:22.162
To be honest, he belongs to my son.

10:22.164 --> 10:24.864
And he's too busy getting
high to give a shit about him.

10:24.866 --> 10:26.599
It's not going to be painful,

10:26.601 --> 10:28.802
but I do have things I could do today.

10:28.804 --> 10:30.203
- Okay.
- Great.

10:30.205 --> 10:34.741
And just like that, this unloved
reptile was left in my care.

10:34.743 --> 10:36.509
However, it was, in no way

10:36.511 --> 10:39.012
that really meant anything, my pet.

10:39.014 --> 10:42.082
I realized, I would not have
a genuine experience of this

10:42.084 --> 10:43.750
unless I spent at least a day

10:43.752 --> 10:47.087
or 2 bonding with my lizard.

10:47.089 --> 10:48.763
Hello, Beyonce.

10:48.788 --> 10:52.292
- Oh, cool, a bearded dragon!
- Mm-hmm.

10:52.294 --> 10:54.027
My brother had one of
these when I was a kid.

10:54.029 --> 10:55.395
- Oh, yeah?
- What's up, dude?

10:55.397 --> 10:57.197
You're supposed to spritz
him with water once a day.

10:57.199 --> 10:58.965
Do you have a spray bottle for that?

10:58.967 --> 11:00.467
I wouldn't worry about it.

11:00.469 --> 11:02.402
Well, it's fine. Like,
I'll get you set up.

11:02.404 --> 11:04.137
I'll get, like, crickets
and stuff, it'll be fun.

11:04.139 --> 11:05.305
No, really.

11:05.307 --> 11:07.006
Josh? Don't bother, okay?

11:07.008 --> 11:08.475
No, it's cool, man.

11:08.477 --> 11:10.076
It did not seem possible for me

11:10.078 --> 11:12.078
to form a connection with this creature,

11:12.080 --> 11:16.783
whose name I later learned was
popularly pronounced Beyoncé.

11:16.785 --> 11:18.118
It barely moved.

11:18.120 --> 11:20.587
The crickets that wandered
freely around the habitat

11:20.589 --> 11:22.555
seemed like more interesting pets.

11:22.557 --> 11:26.493
Beyoncé was stoic, remote and ill.

11:26.495 --> 11:28.128
But by the end of the second day,

11:28.130 --> 11:30.230
I began to take comfort in his quiet,

11:30.232 --> 11:32.265
undemanding presence.

11:34.936 --> 11:38.171
And on the third day,
something remarkable happened.

11:38.173 --> 11:39.906
Oh, hey, you guys!

11:39.908 --> 11:41.374
You guys! Look! Look at this!

11:41.376 --> 11:43.910
- What's up, Mr. MacNeil?
- The crickets are ge.

11:43.912 --> 11:45.345
Beyoncé ate the crickets.

11:45.347 --> 11:47.413
- That's so great, Mr. MacNeil.
- I know.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.949
- That's wild.
- You're such a good dad!

11:49.951 --> 11:52.085
- Want me to get more crickets?
- Yes! Get more crickets!

11:52.087 --> 11:54.554
- I mean, he's hungry, right?
- Yeah, okay, cool. Come on.

11:54.556 --> 11:55.822
Wow.

11:55.824 --> 11:58.825
It appeared that all Beyoncé
needed was a little TLC,

11:58.827 --> 12:01.794
or at least not to be
completely ignored by a druggie

12:01.796 --> 12:03.863
and his heartless mother. Sorry.

12:03.865 --> 12:06.266
I knew that Beyoncé was only in my care

12:06.268 --> 12:08.201
for the purpose of being euthanized

12:08.203 --> 12:10.470
and that he wouldn't
be around much longer.

12:10.472 --> 12:12.972
But still, it was nice
to see him rebound.

12:14.876 --> 12:16.609
Oh, hey, Grant, did I
tell you that yesterday...

12:16.611 --> 12:18.444
Can it wait?

12:18.446 --> 12:20.680
I want to hear the flute.

12:22.350 --> 12:24.617
Beyoncé and I even
seemed to be developing

12:24.619 --> 12:26.819
some actual form of communication.

12:26.821 --> 12:30.056
Hello. Hi! Hello!

12:30.058 --> 12:32.725
The more time I spent with the
increasingly healthy lizard...

12:32.727 --> 12:34.394
Here we go. The more I realized

12:34.396 --> 12:36.296
that this was no ordinary animal.

12:36.298 --> 12:38.565
Behind those eyes was

12:38.567 --> 12:41.034
a whole world of thoughts and feelings.

12:41.036 --> 12:44.504
He was wise and soulful and kind.

12:44.506 --> 12:46.706
I have no use for a
friend of any species,

12:46.708 --> 12:49.642
but the fates had brought
Beyoncé and me together,

12:49.644 --> 12:51.044
and the thought of killing him began

12:51.046 --> 12:52.512
to seem like a bit of a waste.

12:52.514 --> 12:53.846
And just put that right there.

12:53.848 --> 12:55.315
My producer, Grant,

12:55.317 --> 12:57.917
does an impressive and
always appreciated job

12:57.919 --> 12:59.552
of keeping me on task.

12:59.554 --> 13:04.023
Lately, I could feel his
eyes on me and Beyoncé.

13:04.025 --> 13:05.925
And I knew what he was thinking.

13:05.927 --> 13:07.160
Ah. Grant.

13:07.162 --> 13:08.595
I think I know what you're here to say.

13:08.597 --> 13:10.263
I've been spending a lot
of time with Beyoncé.

13:10.265 --> 13:12.665
And this is not a
review of having a pet.

13:12.667 --> 13:15.068
It's a review of putting a pet to sleep.

13:15.070 --> 13:16.936
That is what I was going to say.

13:16.938 --> 13:19.539
I feel like you're
falling for this lizard

13:19.541 --> 13:21.474
and forgetting what you have it for.

13:21.476 --> 13:24.010
Uh, no. Come on, Grant.

13:24.012 --> 13:26.946
I'm not capable of falling
for anything except "Review."

13:26.948 --> 13:28.548
Now, having said that,

13:28.550 --> 13:30.917
I will not be euthanizing Beyoncé.

13:30.919 --> 13:32.185
Forrest. No.

13:32.187 --> 13:33.886
This is no regular dime
store lizard, Grant.

13:33.888 --> 13:35.755
He just returned from
the brink of death.

13:35.757 --> 13:36.956
Does that sound familiar?

13:36.958 --> 13:38.391
That happened to you and me too, right?

13:38.393 --> 13:40.460
You relate to him, don't
you? I've gotten to know him.

13:40.462 --> 13:43.563
And he's actually extremely intelligent.

13:43.565 --> 13:45.632
I mean, it's like, there's
a lot going on up there.

13:45.634 --> 13:47.000
So it would be a crime.

13:47.002 --> 13:49.769
Which is why I have purchased...

13:49.771 --> 13:51.437
Aha!

13:51.439 --> 13:55.475
Another pet for the
express purpose of keeping

13:55.477 --> 13:57.377
for a couple of days and then killing.

13:57.379 --> 14:00.146
I'm gonna kill that one
instead. I named him Deyoncé.

14:00.148 --> 14:01.781
Take a look. Here you go.

14:01.783 --> 14:05.485
Beyoncé and Deyoncé.

14:05.487 --> 14:08.488
Friends for 1 or 2 days tops.

14:08.490 --> 14:11.557
And then, that one, I'm gonna kill.

14:11.559 --> 14:14.661
That sounds fine.

14:14.663 --> 14:17.063
Good. Yeah.

14:17.065 --> 14:19.999
Since any animal at all
would do for this assignment,

14:20.001 --> 14:21.434
I felt I'd found a good way

14:21.436 --> 14:24.304
to spare the life of a
creature with whom I had perhaps

14:24.306 --> 14:26.873
developed some kind of mutual respect.

14:26.875 --> 14:29.676
But there was a
terrible flaw in my plan.

14:30.446 --> 14:31.368
The picture is good,

14:31.393 --> 14:33.146
but I wish it could
look more old-timey.

14:33.148 --> 14:34.514
You know how old-timey
paper was all yellow, and...

14:34.516 --> 14:37.550
Yes! Just like that! Oh, that's perfect!

14:37.575 --> 14:38.059
Okay.

14:38.084 --> 14:40.660
Whoa. Where's Beyoncé?

14:40.715 --> 14:41.481
Isn't that Beyoncé?

14:41.506 --> 14:43.207
No, this is my new lizard, Deyoncé.

14:43.232 --> 14:45.020
Whoa! Where's Beyoncé?

14:45.288 --> 14:46.644
Wait, did you 'em in there together?

14:46.834 --> 14:47.660
Yeah, why?

14:47.685 --> 14:50.908
You shouldn't put two bearded
dragons in the same tank.

14:50.933 --> 14:53.167
- Why not?
- Is that Beyoncé's foot?

14:53.169 --> 14:54.434
- Oh!
- Okay.

14:54.436 --> 14:56.103
Oh, no! What happened?!

14:56.105 --> 14:58.505
Yeah, sometimes they eat
each other. It's crazy.

14:58.507 --> 15:00.140
What the [bleep] are you talking about?!

15:00.142 --> 15:01.341
I knew that. Ere's videos on YouTube...

15:01.343 --> 15:02.843
What the [bleep] are you talking about?!

15:02.845 --> 15:04.611
These [bleep] lizards eat each other?!

15:04.613 --> 15:05.779
Oh, so we both knew that.

15:05.781 --> 15:07.014
Why the didn't you tell me that?!

15:07.016 --> 15:08.282
Oh, I thought we all knew that.

15:08.284 --> 15:10.117
I put them both in the same thing,

15:10.119 --> 15:11.819
and one of them ate the other one?!

15:16.158 --> 15:18.351
Well, I deal with grief alone.

15:21.764 --> 15:24.097
Maybe he's in the cave?

15:24.099 --> 15:25.532
Yeah, okay. All right.

15:25.534 --> 15:28.836
I looked in the [bleep] cave!

15:28.838 --> 15:30.938
I had no emotional
attachment to Beyoncé

15:30.940 --> 15:33.006
and was not sad for myself.

15:33.008 --> 15:35.509
But the injustice of what
had happened troubled me.

15:35.511 --> 15:38.512
My only friend in the world!

15:50.526 --> 15:54.969
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

15:55.397 --> 15:57.364
After a period of reflection,

15:57.366 --> 15:59.833
I decided that I had
bonded enough with Deyoncé

15:59.835 --> 16:03.103
to have a genuine experience
of putting him to sleep.

16:03.105 --> 16:05.239
You're comin' with
me, you piece of shit.

16:09.311 --> 16:12.346
My experience of putting
Deyoncé to sleep was, frankly,

16:12.348 --> 16:14.848
more like pet capital punishment.

16:14.850 --> 16:16.116
It was justice.

16:16.118 --> 16:18.819
Regrettable, but completely necessary.

16:21.323 --> 16:25.225
I give putting a pet
to sleep three stars.

16:29.031 --> 16:32.165
Next up, a tweet from GoGoOctavio.

16:32.167 --> 16:33.800
I love the tweets! Uh-huh.

16:33.802 --> 16:37.037
"You survived death, so
here's a present from me."

16:37.039 --> 16:39.606
What's it like to make
your dream come true?

16:39.608 --> 16:42.042
"Ta-da!"

16:42.044 --> 16:43.410
Ta-da.

16:43.412 --> 16:45.212
What's it like to make
my dream come true?

16:45.214 --> 16:47.814
What an... What an odd request that is.

16:47.816 --> 16:49.449
To go to sleep and have a dream

16:49.451 --> 16:52.085
and wake up and reenact
it in the real world?

16:52.087 --> 16:53.453
Should be interesting.

16:53.455 --> 16:56.089
I'm off to make my dream come true.

16:58.994 --> 17:01.528
Grant couldn't let me use
one of his many guest rooms

17:01.530 --> 17:03.096
in case out-of-town
relatives

17:03.098 --> 17:05.531
dropped by unexpectedly. You never know.

17:05.534 --> 17:08.301
So I spent my nights in
his garage on a sturdy

17:08.304 --> 17:10.237
cot that I rented from him.

17:10.239 --> 17:14.325
A perfect place for sleeping,
and thus, for dreaming.

17:15.010 --> 17:17.477
I had never given a moment's
thought to my dreams.

17:17.479 --> 17:20.113
But now I would record one precisely

17:20.115 --> 17:22.715
and then reenact it in the real world.

17:22.718 --> 17:24.651
Okay, interesting stuff.

17:24.653 --> 17:27.454
There's gonna be some props to
round up, so please take notes.

17:27.455 --> 17:28.822
All right, so, it starts.

17:28.824 --> 17:31.558
And I'm walking down a
quaint, tree-lined street.

17:31.560 --> 17:34.161
And I've got a plate
and my penis is on it.

17:34.163 --> 17:36.797
And, uh, no. Sorry, not penis, peacock.

17:36.799 --> 17:39.099
- Thank [bleep] God.
- It's just my handwriting.

17:39.101 --> 17:40.500
Something slips out of my pants...

17:40.502 --> 17:42.169
- There it is.
- ... and it's my lizard.

17:42.171 --> 17:44.171
- Thank [bleep] God.
- He scampers away.

17:44.173 --> 17:46.106
And then we arrive at a park.

17:46.108 --> 17:48.442
And my ex-wife is there
on a picnic blanket.

17:48.444 --> 17:50.110
And she's got Thanksgiving dinner out

17:50.112 --> 17:52.245
with all the trimmings,
and then I hear a voice.

17:52.247 --> 17:54.314
And I run to it. And then I get lost.

17:54.316 --> 17:56.316
And then I get really, really scared.

17:56.318 --> 17:58.585
And that's when I woke up. Wild, right?

17:58.587 --> 18:00.320
- Mm.
- That shouldn't be too hard.

18:00.322 --> 18:03.457
Yeah. There's just one
part I got to work out.

18:03.459 --> 18:05.459
Convincing my ex-wife

18:05.461 --> 18:07.294
to help me make my dream come true

18:07.296 --> 18:08.795
by playing a role in it

18:08.797 --> 18:11.099
would require all of my charms.

18:12.368 --> 18:14.234
Go away. I mean it.

18:14.236 --> 18:18.005
Which were difficult to
deploy through a closed door.

18:18.007 --> 18:21.333
And so I went back to
the drawing dream-board.

18:22.511 --> 18:23.977
Hmm.

18:23.979 --> 18:26.546
Unfortunately, Suzanne
also played a large role

18:26.548 --> 18:28.849
in the dreams I had the next night.

18:28.851 --> 18:30.421
No.

18:31.653 --> 18:33.153
Hmm.

18:33.155 --> 18:35.022
Yes. Yes.

18:38.160 --> 18:40.027
And the night after that.

18:40.029 --> 18:41.328
Suzanne.

18:41.330 --> 18:43.163
What the [bleep] is the matter with me?

18:43.165 --> 18:45.232
Oh, Suzanne.

18:45.234 --> 18:47.634
Suzanne. Suzanne.

18:47.636 --> 18:49.169
To my great frustration,

18:49.171 --> 18:50.904
it appeared that my sleeping brain

18:50.906 --> 18:53.640
was constantly dwelling on my ex-wife.

18:53.642 --> 18:55.042
Perhaps if Suzanne had been

18:55.044 --> 18:57.110
more willing to open the door to me,

18:57.112 --> 18:59.079
she and I could have
moved on from one another

18:59.081 --> 19:00.514
in a healthier way.

19:00.516 --> 19:01.982
Ugh. Oh, [bleep].

19:01.984 --> 19:05.085
And my dreams would be
free to explore other ideas.

19:05.087 --> 19:07.058
Come on. Come on. Suzanne!

19:07.083 --> 19:10.624
Amazingly, this prlem
persisted for 27 nights.

19:10.626 --> 19:13.927
Suzanne! Finally, I could wait no more.

19:13.929 --> 19:16.096
If this task were ever to be completed,

19:16.098 --> 19:17.497
I would simply have to reenact

19:17.499 --> 19:19.166
a dream that involved Suzanne.

19:19.168 --> 19:22.302
Would she cooperate or
thwart my life's work?

19:22.304 --> 19:25.105
There was only one way to know.

19:26.263 --> 19:28.417
Looking back on it now,
it occurs to me that

19:28.442 --> 19:30.768
when people speak of
making a dream come true...

19:30.934 --> 19:34.136
... they are usually referring
to realizing an aspiration,

19:34.161 --> 19:36.027
rather than reenacting the pointless

19:36.052 --> 19:37.762
meanderings of a sleeping brain.

19:37.787 --> 19:39.053
Ah.

19:39.055 --> 19:40.955
I would like a hot dog, please.

19:40.957 --> 19:42.256
They're free.

19:42.258 --> 19:43.723
Thank you.

19:43.748 --> 19:46.294
Perhaps that would have been
a more meaningful exploration.

19:46.296 --> 19:48.763
Forrest. I talked to the judge,

19:48.765 --> 19:50.565
and he wants to end the trial

19:50.567 --> 19:52.567
because he doesn't like you

19:52.569 --> 19:54.587
and he wants you to go to jail.

19:54.612 --> 19:56.971
Suzanne!

19:59.642 --> 20:01.142
This was the moment of truth.

20:01.144 --> 20:02.577
Suzanne!

20:02.579 --> 20:04.979
I needed Suzanne to act
in a very specific way

20:04.981 --> 20:07.081
and had no idea if she would comply.

20:07.083 --> 20:09.317
Go away, Forrest.

20:09.319 --> 20:13.154
Incredibly, Suzanne played
her role to perfection.

20:15.322 --> 20:17.355
Then I woke up. Perfect!

20:17.460 --> 20:19.861
Haha, we did it. Great job, everybody.

20:19.863 --> 20:21.929
That was exactly how I dreamed it.

20:21.931 --> 20:23.831
Oh, you know what? I should get dressed.

20:24.761 --> 20:26.551
Psychiatrists have argued

20:26.576 --> 20:28.336
that our dreams provide windows

20:28.338 --> 20:30.505
into our true inner thoughts.

20:30.507 --> 20:32.974
Speaking as a man who has
lived one of those dreams,

20:32.976 --> 20:36.143
I'd say those doctors are
all frauds and hucksters.

20:36.145 --> 20:38.779
But a group project is always fun.

20:38.781 --> 20:42.416
So, making your dream
come true gets four stars.

20:44.521 --> 20:45.820
Forrest, that's the end

20:45.822 --> 20:48.155
of the first episode of season three!

20:48.157 --> 20:50.124
Well, we're just getting started, A.J.

20:50.126 --> 20:52.059
We'll see you next time on "Review."

20:52.061 --> 20:53.554
"Review."
