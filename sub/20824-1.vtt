00:00.666 --> 00:02.435
You remember your uncles, don't you, J?

00:02.469 --> 00:03.637
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:03.669 --> 00:05.471
We're about to pull a good
job here, life-changing money.

00:05.705 --> 00:07.273
Camp Pendleton... we're gonna hit it.

00:07.307 --> 00:09.910
There is a ton of cash on that base.

00:09.943 --> 00:12.578
I did coke with Craig,
and then I fucked him.

00:12.612 --> 00:14.548
- You and me gonna have a problem?
- Oh, no, we're cool.

00:14.580 --> 00:16.383
- I'm here for Craig.
- Who are you?

00:16.415 --> 00:17.818
- His mother.
- You called your mom?

00:17.851 --> 00:20.520
You use me to do the dirty work.

00:20.554 --> 00:21.788
You call that being a mother?

00:21.821 --> 00:24.924
She's betrayed you over and over,

00:24.958 --> 00:28.128
and now she's betraying your family.

00:36.303 --> 00:39.206
I was in Mommy's car. A man was driving.

00:39.239 --> 00:41.542
Who? You remember who? No?

00:41.575 --> 00:43.443
Lena, where were you going?

00:43.475 --> 00:44.810
If Cath was stepping out on me,

00:44.843 --> 00:46.279
she wouldn't leave
Lena alone in the house.

00:46.313 --> 00:48.182
She wouldn't do it, not ever!

00:48.215 --> 00:49.816
She's gone for good.

00:49.849 --> 00:52.419
I know something happened.
She wouldn't leave.

00:52.451 --> 00:55.221
I have something for you.
A man should have a gun.

00:55.255 --> 00:57.224
See, my mom... she hated them.

00:57.256 --> 01:00.893
In the end, she's a
Cody. And I'm a Cody, too.

02:51.337 --> 02:52.339
Come on in.

03:15.061 --> 03:18.031
Come on in here. We're
gonna try a new lager.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.513
Grab another beer just over here...

06:00.059 --> 06:02.496
You all right? You okay? Hey!

06:02.528 --> 06:04.864
- You okay? Get up, get up, get up.
- Where'd the hell that guy come from?

06:04.898 --> 06:06.566
- You good?
- We gotta go. We got to go.

06:06.599 --> 06:07.734
Good?

06:15.941 --> 06:18.078
Come on. Come on!

06:18.111 --> 06:19.679
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

06:37.729 --> 06:39.499
Go, go, go!

06:53.580 --> 06:55.582
C-Cover it.

07:13.999 --> 07:15.801
Ahh.

07:18.705 --> 07:22.342
What? What about this
is so funny to you, huh?

07:22.374 --> 07:25.345
Look, you remember when
you and Pope duct taped this

07:25.378 --> 07:26.947
to that shopping cart when we were kids,

07:26.979 --> 07:29.749
with the, uh, Roman candles on the side?

07:29.782 --> 07:31.685
Sent it down Quarry Hill?

07:31.717 --> 07:33.819
- Yeah, I do.
- Yeah, I still have a scar on my ass

07:33.852 --> 07:35.354
when I bounced out of that.

07:35.388 --> 07:36.957
Yeah, you got off easy, man.

07:36.989 --> 07:38.624
I went over the cliff in that thing.

07:38.657 --> 07:40.826
I hit the lake like cement.

08:06.753 --> 08:08.121
That's it!

08:08.153 --> 08:11.257
That's it? Oh, you gotta be shitting me.

08:52.098 --> 08:54.267
You sure no one got made?

08:54.300 --> 08:57.036
Only thing about the
job that went right.

08:57.069 --> 08:59.073
Yeah, thanks to J.

08:59.106 --> 09:01.107
That was quick thinking, baby.

09:01.140 --> 09:05.411
We're all okay, by the way.

09:05.444 --> 09:08.414
You said this thing was solid.

09:08.448 --> 09:10.683
You said it was north of 90 grand.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.086
It was supposed to be.

09:12.119 --> 09:14.088
Then what the hell happened?

09:19.393 --> 09:22.162
Now let's go eat that pie.

09:22.194 --> 09:25.299
We risk our lives for $500.

09:25.332 --> 09:27.433
All she can talk about is pie.

09:27.467 --> 09:30.169
It's not even $500. That
would've been a fair split.

09:30.202 --> 09:33.573
We pitched her a million other jobs.

09:33.606 --> 09:36.510
But no, has to be the brewery.

09:36.543 --> 09:39.580
- All our ideas were shit.
- Pope, now's not the time, man.

09:39.612 --> 09:42.049
You don't think we deserve
more of an explanation?

09:42.082 --> 09:46.120
One job goes bad, and you're whining
like a bunch of spoiled brats!

09:46.153 --> 09:49.656
What about the jobs that
raised you all your life?

09:49.688 --> 09:52.192
You're still living off of
Pendleton, every one of you.

09:52.225 --> 09:54.395
That was Baz, not you.

09:54.428 --> 09:56.563
Why don't you have another drink, Smurf?

09:57.697 --> 09:59.433
I wonder how many cocktails she had

09:59.466 --> 10:03.137
when she had the brilliant
idea for us to hit a brewery.

10:06.106 --> 10:10.077
Maybe this was your fault.
Do you ever think of that?

10:10.110 --> 10:11.745
Huh?

10:11.778 --> 10:15.449
No deliveries by the
northeast gate ever?

10:15.481 --> 10:16.717
Who came up with that great idea?

10:16.750 --> 10:20.587
In the three weeks we scouted
the place, not once was it used.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.556
Should've scouted it for four then.

10:22.588 --> 10:25.058
- And what about the safe?
- What about the safe?

10:25.092 --> 10:26.559
How do you know you have the right safe?

10:26.592 --> 10:29.295
We got the right safe!
It had 3 grand in it!

10:30.529 --> 10:33.699
I'm so sick of this shit.
This is what she does.

10:33.732 --> 10:35.635
She's trying to pit
us against each other

10:35.669 --> 10:37.471
'cause she knows that
if we stick together...

10:37.504 --> 10:39.440
What?! What? Tell me what.

10:39.472 --> 10:42.241
Oh, come on, baby boy. I'm
all ears. I'm listening.

10:42.275 --> 10:44.310
Guys, let's cool it out. Cool it out.

10:45.611 --> 10:47.313
Let's just forget it, Smurf, okay?

10:47.347 --> 10:49.449
- Come on, let's forget it.
- Yeah, I'll forget it,

10:49.482 --> 10:52.251
'cause I have to go pick
your kid up at school.

10:52.284 --> 10:55.655
Unless it was something
you were planning to do.

11:05.231 --> 11:07.333
Why?

11:07.366 --> 11:09.803
Why are we still letting
her run shit? Hmm?

11:09.836 --> 11:11.871
We should just kick
her to the curb, man.

11:11.874 --> 11:15.446
- We're not 12 anymore.
- Give it a rest, man, please.

11:16.613 --> 11:18.582
All right, thanks for
being such pussies then.

11:18.615 --> 11:19.682
What, 'cause we didn't
make empty threats?

11:19.716 --> 11:22.619
- They're not empty threats!
- How are they not empty?

11:22.652 --> 11:24.802
Man, you get pissed off, you
disappear for a few weeks,

11:24.851 --> 11:26.721
and then you come crawling back.

11:26.754 --> 11:28.355
When you're ready to
walk, you let us know.

11:28.388 --> 11:31.091
Until then, please, shut up about it.

11:32.158 --> 11:35.830
Let's walk. For real, let's walk.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.232
She doesn't give a shit about any of us.

11:39.265 --> 11:40.967
We know it. That's
the most pathetic part.

11:41.999 --> 11:44.004
She just uses us to get what she wants.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.407
I think that she's just upset.

11:49.176 --> 11:51.746
You think you know her
better than we do, J?

11:54.148 --> 11:56.850
What she's really capable of?

11:57.451 --> 12:00.855
Guys, that job was a
shit show, no question.

12:00.888 --> 12:02.523
We're all pissed. I get it.

12:02.556 --> 12:04.057
But the smart thing to do right now

12:04.091 --> 12:06.860
is to take a beat and just cool out.

12:06.894 --> 12:10.398
- Cool out.
- While you play peacemaker with her?

12:12.365 --> 12:14.134
Fine. Then what?

12:14.168 --> 12:16.537
When she gets back, let's talk to her.

12:16.570 --> 12:19.540
Let's tell her why
things have to change.

12:19.572 --> 12:22.842
Now she knows how fed up we are.
That's good. It's sinking in.

12:22.875 --> 12:24.778
Calmly, with respect,

12:24.812 --> 12:27.749
we make her see she has no choice.

12:32.186 --> 12:35.156
No. I'm done.

12:35.188 --> 12:36.823
- That's it? You're done?
- Yeah.

12:36.856 --> 12:39.894
I'll do jobs solo if I have
to not to put up with her shit.

12:39.927 --> 12:42.830
- What the hell, Pope?
- Let him go. He's fine. He'll be fine.

12:45.198 --> 12:48.434
We'll talk to Smurf later, yeah?

12:48.467 --> 12:50.237
Let's do it.

12:52.004 --> 12:53.439
Okay.

12:53.472 --> 12:55.809
Let's just go surf it off, man.

12:55.842 --> 12:58.211
All right, maybe I'll
meet you over there.

13:40.353 --> 13:41.855
It's 34 grand.

13:45.958 --> 13:46.993
Look, I just need more time...

13:47.026 --> 13:49.763
- Time.
- Yeah.

13:49.797 --> 13:51.432
Shit, that's a new one.

13:53.299 --> 13:54.467
Please.

13:54.500 --> 13:58.938
I thought I was gonna get
some more money today, but I...

13:58.972 --> 14:01.775
Look, I'll have the rest to
you soon, okay? I promise.

14:01.808 --> 14:03.209
I want to help you, kid,

14:03.242 --> 14:05.912
but it's got to be the full 50,

14:05.946 --> 14:10.184
or else... there's nothing I can do.

14:26.098 --> 14:27.867
You got your coloring in there?

14:28.899 --> 14:29.435
- Yes.
- Okay, good girl.

14:29.468 --> 14:31.304
I'll be back in a minute.

14:40.614 --> 14:42.850
Again. One more time.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.518
Go inside and help Mommy.

14:45.552 --> 14:46.986
Go in.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.789
Now, go.

14:50.356 --> 14:53.993
I still get my 10 grand?

14:54.026 --> 14:57.530
You said the brewery paid
their illegals with cash.

14:57.563 --> 15:00.200
Now what the hell happened, Teddy?

15:00.233 --> 15:02.502
I was gonna ask you the same.

15:04.972 --> 15:08.608
I said the first Thursday
of each month, not Tuesday.

15:08.641 --> 15:10.510
Today's Tuesday.

15:18.885 --> 15:21.889
Janine.

15:21.922 --> 15:23.491
Where you goin'?

16:22.316 --> 16:26.020
And they're tearing it up
here on the downhill challenge.

16:26.053 --> 16:28.188
... knee drags as he
comes around the curve.

16:28.221 --> 16:31.123
- What are you working on?
- Oh, just physics.

16:31.257 --> 16:33.426
Splittin' atoms and shit?

16:33.459 --> 16:35.695
Um, no, just some
problems on acceleration.

16:35.728 --> 16:37.698
Oh, Jesus, not again.

16:37.731 --> 16:40.200
How many times do I have to say the flu?

16:40.232 --> 16:43.169
_

16:43.202 --> 16:46.640
Where's Pope?

16:46.673 --> 16:47.942
No idea.

16:49.608 --> 16:51.210
Said you were gonna get him here, man.

16:51.244 --> 16:54.114
Well, if he shows, he
shows. We don't need him.

17:02.551 --> 17:04.453
Daddy, can we go to the park?

17:04.487 --> 17:06.589
- No, not right now.
- But you promised.

17:06.623 --> 17:10.527
Not right now. Go in the living
room and watch cartoons, okay?

17:14.497 --> 17:16.834
Pope all right?

17:18.468 --> 17:19.935
Yeah, he's all right. He's all right.

17:19.969 --> 17:21.837
He's just doing up his place. He's...

17:21.871 --> 17:23.806
Think he's out buying
a lamp or something.

17:23.839 --> 17:26.342
Ah. First a rug, now a lamp.

17:26.375 --> 17:30.346
He's not careful, it won't
look like a prison cell anymore.

17:32.781 --> 17:36.852
So, look, earlier, Smurf,
we got a bit out of line.

17:36.885 --> 17:40.022
Jobs are risky, we get it. Shit happens.

17:40.056 --> 17:42.026
Who's to blame shouldn't
be the point here.

17:48.530 --> 17:51.367
We gotta talk about
changing some things.

17:51.401 --> 17:54.371
Yeah?

17:54.403 --> 17:55.505
Like what?

17:55.537 --> 17:57.473
Well, first...

17:57.507 --> 17:59.843
we want more of a say
in what jobs we do.

17:59.875 --> 18:03.713
Mm-hmm. Well, you brought me Pendleton.

18:03.747 --> 18:05.515
We ran with it.

18:05.547 --> 18:08.984
Yeah, but since then, you've
shut down everything else, so...

18:09.018 --> 18:11.387
Well, every other idea you had was crap.

18:11.421 --> 18:13.757
Not to us, you know, but
we still had to suck it up.

18:13.789 --> 18:15.858
You know, I think all we're
saying is we want to start

18:15.892 --> 18:18.929
making family decisions
in... in a different way.

18:18.961 --> 18:21.999
I mean, we're not kids
anymore. We're grown men here.

18:23.165 --> 18:25.768
I mean, you can't expect us to be...

18:25.801 --> 18:27.470
The boss?

18:27.503 --> 18:29.472
- Oh, I'm the boss all right.
- More of a conversation.

18:29.506 --> 18:31.608
Not so top down.
That's all we're saying.

18:31.641 --> 18:34.044
Is that what you've been
doing while I was out?

18:34.076 --> 18:36.480
Figuring out how to gang up on me?

18:36.512 --> 18:37.880
- Preparing?
- That's not what we're doing, no.

18:37.913 --> 18:40.416
Because if I wasn't the
boss, I have a feeling

18:40.450 --> 18:44.520
the three of you would be in
prison right now, or worse.

18:44.754 --> 18:48.692
You with your little ATM
job. I had to bribe a cop.

18:49.525 --> 18:51.396
Emptied out my bank account.

18:52.728 --> 18:54.597
And what about you
with that Hells Angels

18:54.631 --> 18:57.700
who thought you'd do
better without a tongue?

18:59.802 --> 19:01.705
And you I'm really proud of.

19:01.737 --> 19:06.375
Calling your Mommy to come
save you from a meat locker

19:06.409 --> 19:10.613
where you're tied up to a chair,
naked, covered in your own piss.

19:10.647 --> 19:11.982
Smurf, we get it.

19:12.015 --> 19:13.717
No, you don't get it!

19:13.749 --> 19:16.118
'Cause if you got it,
you'd all be on your knees,

19:16.151 --> 19:19.655
begging for my forgiveness!

19:19.689 --> 19:22.391
It's out of respect we're
being honest with you here.

19:22.424 --> 19:24.927
Why should you keep picking all
the jobs when we take all the risk?

19:24.960 --> 19:27.396
And then on top of it,
you decide the split?

19:27.430 --> 19:29.733
- That's not very fair here.
- You know, when you showed up at my house,

19:29.766 --> 19:31.801
- you hadn't eaten a meal in a week!
- Oh, my God.

19:31.833 --> 19:34.770
It took me three months to
get that lice out of your hair!

19:34.804 --> 19:36.672
Yeah, and not a day goes by
you don't throw that in my face!

19:36.706 --> 19:39.642
How long exactly do I have
to keep kissing your ass for?

19:39.676 --> 19:41.811
- You tell me.
- The rest of your goddamn life.

19:41.843 --> 19:43.680
Oh, the rest of my life?
Oh, here's the thing.

19:43.712 --> 19:45.681
Who do you think's kept this
from happening the last two years?

19:45.715 --> 19:48.785
Pope's not even here 'cause he
can't stand the sight of you.

19:48.817 --> 19:50.719
And who's defended you like an idiot?

19:50.753 --> 19:53.890
Who's tried to convince your
own sons... your own sons...

19:53.922 --> 19:56.892
that you're not the cold-hearted
bitch you seem to be?

19:56.926 --> 19:58.828
Me, Smurf.

19:58.861 --> 20:01.198
Me!

20:03.733 --> 20:07.070
It's a goddamn waste of time.

20:10.273 --> 20:11.940
I'm out.

20:11.974 --> 20:14.377
- Yeah, go ahead.
- Mm-hmm, yep.

20:14.410 --> 20:16.912
- Me, too.
- Go.

20:16.946 --> 20:19.783
Let's see how long you all last.

20:33.897 --> 20:36.367
Knowing that look on her face

20:36.400 --> 20:39.870
when she realized we were
serious was beautiful, man.

20:39.902 --> 20:41.204
I'm gonna remember it
the rest of my life.

20:41.237 --> 20:44.941
Oh, man. I can't believe we did it.

20:44.975 --> 20:47.745
No more suckin' Mommy's dick!

20:49.479 --> 20:52.248
Equal partners at last.

20:52.282 --> 20:55.753
You really think Baz and Pope
are gonna let that happen?

20:55.785 --> 20:57.955
No, man. They're just planning
on being the new Smurf.

20:57.987 --> 20:59.957
Not if we call bullshit.

20:59.989 --> 21:02.258
No, see, we're just grunts to them, man.

21:02.292 --> 21:03.960
And the only way that's gonna
change is if we start doing

21:03.992 --> 21:05.895
our own things, start
coming up with our own ideas.

21:05.929 --> 21:06.930
Our own ideas, you know,

21:06.964 --> 21:08.165
like this yacht thing
I've been thinking about.

21:08.198 --> 21:12.236
I'm telling you, really
up our game, you know?

21:12.268 --> 21:15.038
Yeah, man. I'm with you. Done.

21:15.072 --> 21:17.274
You know what else we need to do?

21:17.306 --> 21:21.245
What? Swing by Kenzo's
and get some more coke?

21:21.277 --> 21:23.447
We need to get J involved, not Baz.

21:23.479 --> 21:25.315
Say what you want, the kid's got balls.

21:25.349 --> 21:27.384
He's gotta be confused
as shit right now.

21:27.417 --> 21:29.920
It's the perfect time
to get in his head.

21:29.952 --> 21:32.789
Well, how do we do that?

21:32.823 --> 21:36.459
Well, for starters, we can
try being nice to the kid.

21:41.832 --> 21:43.400
- Ungrateful?
- Yeah.

21:43.432 --> 21:46.202
Was that before or after
you called her a bitch?

21:46.236 --> 21:47.537
Before.

21:47.571 --> 21:49.406
I told you it was pointless.

21:49.439 --> 21:51.074
Well, it didn't help you didn't show up.

21:51.108 --> 21:54.812
Well, trust me, it would've
gone much worse if I did.

21:54.844 --> 21:58.481
Unless you were gonna stab her
in the face, it's hard to imagine.

21:58.515 --> 22:00.884
Yeah.

22:00.918 --> 22:02.920
Hey, give me two beers, please.

22:02.952 --> 22:05.756
- One beer, yeah?
- Yeah.

22:12.962 --> 22:15.031
- So it's now?
- It's now.

22:15.064 --> 22:16.901
Craig and Deran aren't gonna fold?

22:16.933 --> 22:17.834
They're not gonna fold.

22:17.869 --> 22:19.904
We just gotta get a job together quick.

22:19.937 --> 22:22.072
- I was thinking New Canticle.
- The... the church?

22:22.104 --> 22:24.040
- Yeah.
- Smurf will love that.

22:24.074 --> 22:25.575
It's a ready job. It's good to go.

22:25.609 --> 22:27.912
- We have to re-scout it.
- So we re-scout it. Who cares?

22:27.945 --> 22:30.247
- What about the kid?
- What about the kid?

22:30.279 --> 22:31.447
We use him if we need him

22:31.480 --> 22:33.116
if he's willing to piss off Grandma.

22:33.150 --> 22:34.584
So far he's just kept his mouth shut.

22:34.618 --> 22:37.388
- Can you blame him?
- I don't blame him.

22:37.420 --> 22:40.056
I don't trust him yet, either.

22:44.182 --> 22:46.051
We gotta throw Smurf a cut.

22:46.084 --> 22:48.255
- I mean, not like usual, but something.
- Why?

22:48.287 --> 22:50.189
She's got her building.
She's not gonna starve.

22:50.223 --> 22:52.125
I wouldn't give a
shit if she did starve.

22:52.158 --> 22:54.060
Pope, it's just smart.

22:54.092 --> 22:57.130
Feel like you owe her
something? You pay her.

22:57.162 --> 22:59.198
I'm not paying her.

22:59.232 --> 23:01.568
I wish she'd have
dropped me and Julia off

23:01.601 --> 23:04.004
at a firehouse door the day she had us.

23:05.506 --> 23:07.007
What's going on with you guys?

23:07.339 --> 23:09.308
Nothin'. The same as you.

23:09.342 --> 23:13.412
I just finally see her for what she is.

23:24.589 --> 23:26.558
Jesus, man. Just do it already.

23:26.592 --> 23:28.528
The kid broke up with
her. Why can't you?

23:28.560 --> 23:30.797
Just gotta keep her in check.

23:30.829 --> 23:31.830
Sex can't be that good.

23:31.864 --> 23:34.601
What, is she waving her
pompoms at you in bed?

23:34.634 --> 23:37.069
What's going on? Did you fill this?

23:37.103 --> 23:40.140
No. My card got denied.

23:40.172 --> 23:43.710
So you've just been standing
here, not pumping gas?

23:45.845 --> 23:49.281
I can't be fronting you
like this all the time.

23:49.315 --> 23:52.052
What, did you forget to
pay a bill or something?

23:52.085 --> 23:54.754
I don't know. Smurf pays for it.

23:54.787 --> 23:56.355
Not anymore.

23:56.389 --> 23:58.158
She just canceled this shit.

23:58.191 --> 24:00.226
Shit, that was fast.

24:00.259 --> 24:04.597
Yeah, that's why we need to hit
that yacht or something, soon.

24:06.132 --> 24:08.634
I need the cash. Don't you?

24:08.668 --> 24:10.470
Well, I do now.

24:18.277 --> 24:20.080
- You want another one? Let's do another one.
- No.

24:20.113 --> 24:21.448
- Can we get two more, please?
- No.

24:21.480 --> 24:23.249
Have another one.

24:23.281 --> 24:26.118
Don't you have to get Lena?

24:26.152 --> 24:28.720
It's not even late.

24:28.753 --> 24:32.257
Smurf could use a distraction
after what happened.

24:35.361 --> 24:37.097
You been seeing Lucy, too?

24:37.130 --> 24:39.732
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm?

24:39.765 --> 24:41.468
And what did she say when
you told her about Cath?

24:41.500 --> 24:43.403
I didn't tell her about Cath.

24:43.435 --> 24:45.270
She'd be up here with
the U-Haul in two minutes.

24:45.304 --> 24:46.506
Are you kidding me?

24:46.538 --> 24:49.608
It's not happening.

24:49.642 --> 24:52.112
Friend's kind of cute on the right, no?

24:52.144 --> 24:53.480
- Oh.
- Oh?

24:53.512 --> 24:56.215
No, no, no.

24:56.249 --> 24:58.218
I'm all out of antibiotics.

25:01.787 --> 25:04.824
- I'll see you tomorrow. Have fun.
- Okay.

25:12.330 --> 25:15.234
Excuse me. Um...

25:15.268 --> 25:17.237
you've been staring at
me, and I'm awfully shy,

25:17.269 --> 25:20.673
so it's... it's a bit weird for me.

25:47.833 --> 25:50.202
Come on.

25:50.236 --> 25:53.273
Here. You take the candy.

25:53.306 --> 25:55.441
Get the movie ready, okay?

26:06.251 --> 26:07.854
Damn.

26:07.886 --> 26:10.557
Manny said you'd still look good.

26:12.325 --> 26:14.227
You recognize me?

26:16.229 --> 26:17.831
I'm all grown.

26:20.532 --> 26:23.836
Now what are you doing here, Javi?

26:25.371 --> 26:27.974
I left you 10 messages.

26:28.007 --> 26:32.445
I figured they were from Manny.

26:34.512 --> 26:36.316
He wants to see you,

26:36.348 --> 26:38.518
so I'm here to take you.

26:40.252 --> 26:42.788
To the desert?

26:42.822 --> 26:44.457
Yeah.

26:47.559 --> 26:49.995
Let me go put this away.

26:50.028 --> 26:52.598
Come on, I'll give you a beer.

26:59.305 --> 27:01.975
Some big boys to feed.

27:04.844 --> 27:09.481
Look, Manny's not gettin'
another cent from me.

27:12.384 --> 27:14.554
It's 5K a month, just like we agreed.

27:15.585 --> 27:16.422
He should know that by now.

27:16.454 --> 27:17.890
He's dying.

27:20.558 --> 27:23.296
He'd be pissed I said it like that.

27:23.328 --> 27:25.397
There it is.

27:27.333 --> 27:29.902
I'm parked down the street.

27:29.934 --> 27:32.871
Come on.

27:32.904 --> 27:34.641
No, no, no.

27:34.673 --> 27:39.511
You don't hop my fence and
tell me to get in a car.

27:45.483 --> 27:48.353
He's running out of time.

27:48.386 --> 27:50.722
You get it?

27:50.756 --> 27:52.458
So whatever shit went on between you,

27:52.490 --> 27:54.527
you're gonna come say goodbye.

27:56.495 --> 27:59.465
On my own terms.

27:59.498 --> 28:01.301
Yeah.

28:01.334 --> 28:04.336
You're getting in the car.

28:04.370 --> 28:06.973
No, I'm not.

28:18.451 --> 28:20.452
Whose kid is that?

28:22.387 --> 28:23.822
Baz's.

28:27.727 --> 28:30.363
You gonna sing her to sleep?

28:30.395 --> 28:33.365
How you used to sing to me?

28:39.537 --> 28:41.374
And you won't need that gun.

28:55.593 --> 28:58.398
This is your idea of ideas?

28:58.430 --> 29:01.066
We can rob it for what? Termites?

29:01.100 --> 29:04.704
No, we're not here to
case the place, man.

29:04.737 --> 29:08.807
The owner just died, left
his wife holding the bag.

29:08.841 --> 29:09.876
So?

29:09.909 --> 29:13.345
So that's why I need cash.

29:13.379 --> 29:15.814
I'm gonna buy this place.

29:15.847 --> 29:19.351
Take over the lease and run it.

29:21.853 --> 29:25.891
Come on. I'll buy you a beer. Let's go.

29:27.660 --> 29:30.296
You can't even see the "open" sign.

30:02.073 --> 30:05.043
- Hey.
- Hi, baby.

30:21.292 --> 30:24.263
Can I still live here?

30:25.598 --> 30:28.234
Of course, baby.

30:35.907 --> 30:37.743
The guys, they... they
probably didn't mean

30:37.775 --> 30:39.211
what they said earlier.

30:41.981 --> 30:43.816
You know, they'll come
around, and I think...

30:43.849 --> 30:45.350
Yeah, listen, from now on,

30:45.384 --> 30:49.221
you do whatever you
think is right, okay?

30:49.254 --> 30:53.693
You wanna run some jobs
with the boys, that's fine.

30:53.725 --> 30:58.598
But you can't be a spy if
you want them to trust you.

31:00.299 --> 31:04.170
Or at least, you can't
have them think you're one.

31:06.638 --> 31:09.108
I'm going to bed.

31:09.140 --> 31:10.609
Good night.

31:10.642 --> 31:12.844
Oh, hey, wait, babe.

31:17.015 --> 31:20.652
I got you a credit card.

31:21.887 --> 31:24.790
It's on my account,

31:24.822 --> 31:28.127
so there's no limit.

31:28.159 --> 31:31.598
I trust you'll be responsible.

31:36.702 --> 31:38.338
Thank you, Smurf.

31:43.108 --> 31:45.611
Get a good night's sleep.

32:07.800 --> 32:09.435
Hey.

32:09.467 --> 32:11.836
Shit. You can knock.

32:11.869 --> 32:15.340
Oh, sorry. Um...

32:15.373 --> 32:18.977
I'm hungry. You hungry? You
want some food or something?

32:20.779 --> 32:23.849
I don't want any food.

32:23.881 --> 32:25.917
Just some privacy.

33:01.254 --> 33:03.991
Yo!

33:09.896 --> 33:11.865
Okay, I just had an
epic fight with my dad.

33:11.898 --> 33:14.001
It was, like, nuclear,
my mom screaming at me

33:14.033 --> 33:16.469
- and my stupid brother piling on.
- Wait, wait, wait. Slow down.

33:16.503 --> 33:17.972
Guam. It's really happening.

33:18.004 --> 33:20.273
- What?
- My texts.

33:20.307 --> 33:22.376
Oh, yeah.

33:22.408 --> 33:24.011
I've been, um, sleeping.

33:24.043 --> 33:25.646
That "0-6" position in Guam

33:25.678 --> 33:29.350
running the base's
sewage treatment plant?

33:29.382 --> 33:32.285
He's actually gonna take it,
and he expects us all to move.

33:32.319 --> 33:35.623
Why would you go with your dad
to run a shit factory in Guam?

33:35.656 --> 33:37.491
I told him I'm not going.

33:37.523 --> 33:39.025
Well, tell your dad
to eat a bag of dicks

33:39.059 --> 33:41.427
and that Guam can kiss your ass.

33:41.461 --> 33:42.930
Do you have any tequila or coke?

33:42.963 --> 33:44.898
I'll take any altered
state I can get right now.

33:44.930 --> 33:46.499
No, no. I'm... I'm... I'm still sick.

33:46.532 --> 33:49.503
Oh. I didn't even ask.

33:49.535 --> 33:50.803
You look okay, but did your fever break?

33:50.837 --> 33:53.040
Yeah, but the doctor
said I'm contagious.

33:53.072 --> 33:56.976
I don't care. I'll heat up the soup.

33:57.010 --> 33:58.912
Seriously.

33:58.945 --> 34:01.447
I don't want to get you sick.

34:01.481 --> 34:04.450
Okay. Will you text me
the second you're better?

34:04.483 --> 34:06.886
Uh-huh. Will do.

34:26.438 --> 34:30.311
- Who was that?
- My nephew's girlfriend.

34:30.342 --> 34:33.079
You want soup?

34:33.112 --> 34:35.616
Your turn.

34:41.487 --> 34:43.357
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hey, sweetie.

34:43.389 --> 34:47.561
I told you your daddy would
come back... eventually.

34:47.592 --> 34:50.362
Thanks for watching her.

34:50.396 --> 34:52.565
No worries.

34:52.599 --> 34:54.600
Should've texted you. I apologize.

34:54.632 --> 34:58.504
It would've been nice.

34:58.537 --> 35:00.640
Oh!

35:00.673 --> 35:02.475
Okay, you win.

35:02.508 --> 35:04.110
Go pick up your things.

35:04.144 --> 35:06.347
Daddy and I will be out in a minute.

35:12.519 --> 35:15.456
It's real this time, Smurf.

35:15.488 --> 35:17.925
I'm not gonna be able to walk it back.

35:17.957 --> 35:21.128
I don't remember asking you to.

35:23.796 --> 35:26.532
I talked to Pope. We're
gonna cut you in for 10%.

35:26.566 --> 35:29.870
Wow. 10.

35:31.637 --> 35:33.473
You know, I haven't needed taken care of

35:33.506 --> 35:36.476
since I was 11 years old.

35:36.510 --> 35:39.879
Well, we're gonna do it anyway.

35:39.912 --> 35:41.615
'Cause you always took care of me.

35:41.648 --> 35:43.550
You bet I did.

35:43.582 --> 35:46.086
Grandma, where's Tigey?

35:46.919 --> 35:50.390
Tigey? I think we
left Tigey by the pool.

35:50.423 --> 35:52.025
Let's go see.

36:09.121 --> 36:11.924
- Hey.
- Hey, man. What's up?

36:11.958 --> 36:13.326
Get in the car.

36:13.359 --> 36:15.862
We're gonna go to Baz's,
plan some stuff out.

36:16.175 --> 36:18.644
Oh, no, man, I've got school.

36:18.677 --> 36:20.679
You're too smart already, man.

36:20.713 --> 36:22.749
I think your GPA will survive a day.

36:22.782 --> 36:26.086
Come on, don't you
wanna be a part of this?

36:26.119 --> 36:28.688
Me and Craig think you should be.

36:30.523 --> 36:33.159
Come on, come on. Let's go.

36:37.329 --> 36:39.098
I never went to school.

36:39.131 --> 36:40.400
I can tell, man.

36:47.539 --> 36:50.376
The fancy wedding on a yacht?

36:50.409 --> 36:52.778
Yeah, we hit it while it's
cruising out in the ocean.

36:52.811 --> 36:54.514
Shake down the guests,
we kill the engine,

36:54.546 --> 36:56.715
- and then we get away clean.
- How we supposed to case it?

36:56.749 --> 36:59.185
Not to mention get away
in the middle of the ocean.

36:59.218 --> 37:01.388
- I'm still working out the details, Pope.
- Yeah, or we can hit New Canticle

37:01.421 --> 37:02.656
like we should've done two years ago.

37:02.688 --> 37:06.558
Unless one camera and a fat guy
is too much security for you.

37:06.592 --> 37:09.162
Hey, sorry. What'd I miss?

37:09.195 --> 37:12.664
Uh, nothin'. We're just
talking about the yacht.

37:12.697 --> 37:15.467
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. These guys wanna hit a church.

37:15.501 --> 37:17.759
- New Canticle.
- Like the mega church?

37:17.760 --> 37:19.745
No. Smurf said it was too close.

37:19.715 --> 37:20.660
People from around here go there.

37:20.683 --> 37:22.552
Smurf's not making
decisions now, remember?

37:22.585 --> 37:24.154
About ripping off a church?

37:24.187 --> 37:26.221
What kind of shit
karma's that's gonna be?

37:26.254 --> 37:28.157
I think that ship's sailed, man.

37:28.190 --> 37:29.692
Daddy.

37:29.725 --> 37:32.094
- Daddy, do you like it?
- I love it. Go make another one.

37:32.127 --> 37:33.830
And then we can go to the beach?

37:33.862 --> 37:36.098
No beach. I told you,
no beach today, okay?

37:40.703 --> 37:42.237
I say we vote.

37:43.873 --> 37:45.809
Mega church or the yacht.

37:45.841 --> 37:47.643
J can be the swing.

37:47.676 --> 37:49.211
- What? J?
- No! What are you...

37:49.245 --> 37:51.513
- No, no, no, no!
- Equal votes, equal shares.

37:51.547 --> 37:53.283
- Isn't that the new deal?
- Not if it makes us stupid.

37:53.315 --> 37:56.252
- J's not gonna be the tiebreaker.
- Not happening. Absolutely not.

37:56.285 --> 37:58.721
Okay, so what? You guys are
gonna be the tiebreaker then?

37:58.754 --> 38:01.257
Is that how it's gonna go?
And what about the split?

38:01.290 --> 38:03.226
Is... is that not
gonna be equal anymore?

38:03.259 --> 38:05.728
- It will be mostly, yes.
- Like if one of us takes more risk

38:05.761 --> 38:07.263
or does a lot more of the planning,

38:07.295 --> 38:08.864
- that person should get a bigger cut.
- Yes.

38:08.897 --> 38:11.468
- And who decides when that is?
- We'll figure it out!

38:11.500 --> 38:13.203
- What are you complaining about?
- What if one of us

38:13.236 --> 38:15.105
- hits a job on our own, or two or three of us hit a job?
- Daddy?

38:15.138 --> 38:16.605
What?! Lena, how many
times do I have to tell you?

38:16.638 --> 38:19.475
No beach today. Not happening.

38:23.312 --> 38:25.748
I'll... I'll... I'll take you.

38:28.283 --> 38:30.486
I... I mean, if it's okay with your dad.

38:30.520 --> 38:32.355
Yeah, it's fine. Go ahead.

38:34.257 --> 38:35.758
Let's pick this up later.

38:35.790 --> 38:38.760
You draw this? It's amazing.

38:38.794 --> 38:41.464
J, hang back a minute.

38:43.198 --> 38:45.267
I'll meet you in the car, okay?

38:47.569 --> 38:49.171
Did Smurf tell you to come here?

38:49.205 --> 38:51.274
No.

38:51.306 --> 38:53.208
She didn't send you?

38:53.241 --> 38:56.578
You know that fire you set yesterday?

38:56.611 --> 38:59.115
The boys think that was pretty smart.

39:00.283 --> 39:02.551
You know what I think?

39:02.585 --> 39:04.320
I think bringing cops to the scene

39:04.353 --> 39:05.789
could've really screwed us.

39:07.823 --> 39:11.661
I think being lookout
means you keep looking out.

39:13.596 --> 39:17.266
When I ask you to do something,
I just want you to do it.

39:17.299 --> 39:20.169
- Okay?
- Okay.

39:20.203 --> 39:22.172
Next time you're about to get caught,

39:22.205 --> 39:25.208
I'll just stay in the truck, right?

39:30.946 --> 39:33.215
Better get home now, man.

39:48.188 --> 39:51.792
Your daughter's quite the pro.
What's it been? Like, an hour?

39:51.824 --> 39:54.994
Yeah. Is that your son?

39:55.027 --> 39:56.029
Yeah.

39:56.062 --> 39:58.799
He's... He's... he's good at that.

39:58.831 --> 40:02.034
Hey, could you watch him for a sec?

40:02.067 --> 40:05.438
I just have to change the baby.
I left the wipes in the car.

40:05.471 --> 40:06.841
I'm just right over there.

40:08.808 --> 40:10.877
Sure. No problem.

40:10.911 --> 40:12.913
Thanks.

40:12.946 --> 40:14.982
Can't be too safe, right?

41:20.747 --> 41:22.348
Hey.

41:22.381 --> 41:24.617
- Hola.
- Hi. How are you?

41:24.651 --> 41:26.954
- Good. And you?
- Good.

41:28.854 --> 41:31.358
- Thanks for coming up.
- I didn't.

41:31.390 --> 41:33.493
I was on my way home from Solvang.

41:33.526 --> 41:35.428
What the hell is in Solvang?

41:35.461 --> 41:36.863
You know, this, that.

41:36.897 --> 41:39.567
- Okay.
- Yeah.

41:39.600 --> 41:41.368
You must be feeling lucky today, huh?

41:41.401 --> 41:42.435
Why?

41:42.468 --> 41:46.472
Oh, meeting here, no
hotel. What if Cath walks in

41:46.506 --> 41:48.375
with the guy she's cheating on you with?

41:48.408 --> 41:50.211
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

41:50.243 --> 41:51.579
It's not gonna happen.

41:51.611 --> 41:53.347
- You don't know that.
- No.

41:53.379 --> 41:55.448
We're done. Cath and I are done.

41:55.481 --> 41:57.317
What?

41:57.350 --> 41:58.986
- Yeah, we're done.
- Since when?

41:59.019 --> 42:01.655
I didn't wanna tell you
until I knew it was for real,

42:01.687 --> 42:04.390
- and it's for real.
- Yeah, so instead, you lie to me.

42:04.423 --> 42:06.993
You're not exactly open about
what's going on with you either.

42:07.026 --> 42:09.463
- It's not the same.
- It's not? How's that?

42:09.495 --> 42:11.331
- How's it...
- You know it's not the same.

42:14.901 --> 42:18.272
Okay. Okay.

42:18.305 --> 42:21.341
S-so what now?

42:21.374 --> 42:22.642
Now why don't we go back to my place,

42:22.676 --> 42:24.278
and you can see where I live? What?

42:24.310 --> 42:26.680
Am I just supposed to
just jump at the chance?

42:26.713 --> 42:28.948
Why not?

42:32.551 --> 42:35.388
Is Cath's stuff still at your house?

42:35.421 --> 42:37.291
- Some of it is, yeah.
- Mm.

42:37.323 --> 42:39.993
Well, get it out, and
then I'll think about it.

43:20.334 --> 43:23.069
- No. No. No, no, no.
- Yeah, one more line, bro. I'm...

43:23.102 --> 43:26.339
- No, you're not doing that shit. Stop it!
- Whoa!

43:26.372 --> 43:28.742
- Are you kidding me?!
- What happened to clean up and take a shower

43:28.774 --> 43:30.477
so we can start talking about the yacht?

43:30.510 --> 43:31.611
- I was going to!
- You were gonna?

43:31.644 --> 43:33.012
- Yeah!
- Okay.

43:33.046 --> 43:34.714
You showing up late to
Baz's, all coked out,

43:34.747 --> 43:36.416
while we're trying to
work this shit out, man...

43:36.450 --> 43:37.984
it's not a good look.

43:38.017 --> 43:40.820
And you wonder why
they treat us like kids!

43:40.854 --> 43:43.089
It's 'cause you give 'em a reason to.

43:43.122 --> 43:46.693
Get your shit together,
man! I'm sick of this!

43:46.727 --> 43:48.429
Responsibility!

43:48.461 --> 43:49.829
Okay!

43:54.533 --> 43:56.436
- It's Smurf.
- What's she want?

43:56.470 --> 43:58.571
She's making meat loaf. 7:00.

43:58.604 --> 44:00.973
Well, better make sure
she takes the first bite.

44:01.006 --> 44:02.075
I did it.

44:02.108 --> 44:06.379
I told my dad to eat shit.
I'm not going anywhere.

44:35.508 --> 44:37.410
It's good you came, man.

44:38.544 --> 44:41.481
I sort of had to. I've got Lena.

44:41.515 --> 44:44.518
Right.

44:45.651 --> 44:47.620
Hey, kiddo.

44:47.653 --> 44:50.056
Uncle Pope bought me ice cream.

44:50.089 --> 44:53.426
That's nice. Go say hi to Grandma.

44:57.530 --> 45:00.500
Thanks.

45:00.533 --> 45:03.436
We really gonna do this?

45:03.470 --> 45:05.906
Yep.

45:05.939 --> 45:10.644
She says one goddamn
thing about anything...

45:33.098 --> 45:36.803
At least everybody still
likes the meat loaf, huh?

45:43.042 --> 45:46.946
You trying to rub salt on my wounds?

45:46.979 --> 45:48.615
That it?

45:50.484 --> 45:53.988
I think we all had a
pretty tough day yesterday.

45:56.256 --> 45:59.560
Now this is a family, and
that's never gonna change.

45:59.593 --> 46:01.795
Not ever.

46:03.930 --> 46:07.501
Come on, cut it out.

46:07.533 --> 46:09.502
Let's do it.

46:13.006 --> 46:14.575
May we all get what we want...

46:14.608 --> 46:17.711
And never what we deserve.

46:22.214 --> 46:23.483
So come on.

46:23.517 --> 46:25.719
Tell me, what have you agreed on?

46:25.751 --> 46:28.121
What's your next plan?

46:40.767 --> 46:43.136
I get it, baby. Don't worry.

46:43.169 --> 46:46.874
If you want my help, I'm right here.

46:46.906 --> 46:50.678
J, would you like to
help me with dessert?

47:32.017 --> 47:34.186
He started screaming again.

47:34.220 --> 47:36.689
I upped the morphine on his drip.

48:20.667 --> 48:22.102
Hey.

48:23.669 --> 48:25.705
See you, Lena.

48:25.738 --> 48:27.773
Come on, Lena. Time to go.

48:27.807 --> 48:30.243
Come on. Let's go.

48:30.276 --> 48:33.647
- Thanks for watching her.
- Good night, Uncle Pope.

48:33.680 --> 48:36.317
Good night.

48:45.325 --> 48:47.194
I'll get the rest of the dishes.

48:47.227 --> 48:49.796
Thanks, baby.

48:55.901 --> 48:58.671
Just be careful, man, okay?
