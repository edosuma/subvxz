the onetime printing...

you can help lead us to it.

13:36.081 --> 13:39.175
Hmm, hmm, hmm.
Eww!

13:39.285 --> 13:42.618
What is this?
What are you doing?

13:42.721 --> 13:44.814
Umm, ehh, ooh-

13:44.924 --> 13:49.088
Oh, I get it.
I'm onto you.

13:50.462 --> 13:53.124
You're from <i>Collier's</i> magazine,
aren't you?

13:53.232 --> 13:55.792
Are you going to put me
in "Star Snoop"?

13:55.901 --> 13:59.166
Uh, yeah. Sure.
That thing.

13:59.271 --> 14:03.401
Well, I won't go without a fight. Wink, wink!
[Chuckles] Let me show you around.

14:03.509 --> 14:07.138
- I hope you don't mind a little walking.
- [Groans]

14:07.246 --> 14:10.773
Well, of course, I didn't want
a racehorse in my living room.

14:10.883 --> 14:15.650
- But you don't say no to Spring Byington, do you?
- No, you don't. [Chuckles]

14:15.754 --> 14:18.780
[Chuckling]
Oh, you'll find this amusing-

14:18.891 --> 14:22.019
- the suit Charlie Chaplin was buried in.
- Eww!

14:22.127 --> 14:26.325
Here's a scoop for your readers-
the Hall of Patriots.

14:26.432 --> 14:31.893
That intrepid lad is my
great-grandfather, Franklin Jefferson Burns...

14:32.004 --> 14:34.097
tossing that tea without a care...

14:34.206 --> 14:37.004
for what the caffeine would do
to the Fenway flounder.

14:37.109 --> 14:39.270
- Is that a fish?
- It was.

14:39.378 --> 14:43.144
- Hey, that guy looks like you.
- <i>Oh-ho! That's me, all right-</i>

14:43.249 --> 14:46.582
<i>standing up against</i>
<i>America's reckless spendthrift politicians.</i>

14:46.685 --> 14:52.248
It commemorates my liberation of a trillion dollars
that would have been foolishly squandered.

14:52.358 --> 14:54.986
- Let's move!
- [Gasps]

14:55.094 --> 14:57.528
Is that the trillion-dollar bill
in his hand?

14:57.630 --> 15:01.589
[Chuckles]
That would be pretty careless of me, wouldn't it?

15:01.700 --> 15:05.295
I keep the real bill right here.

15:05.404 --> 15:09.864
Wow! That must be won'th a fortune.

15:09.975 --> 15:11.943
- Nobody move!
- What the-

15:12.044 --> 15:17.380
Montgomery Burns, you're under arrest
for grand, grand, grand, grand larceny.

15:17.483 --> 15:20.577
Uuh! I'm not the thief.
The government is.

15:20.686 --> 15:25.623
Every year you make hardworking joes
like my reporter friend here pay income taxes.

15:25.724 --> 15:29.319
And for what?
Aid to ungrateful foreigners...

15:29.428 --> 15:31.419
do-nothing nuclear missiles...

15:31.530 --> 15:35.022
<i>tomb polish for</i>
<i>some unknown soldier.</i>

15:35.134 --> 15:37.159
Hey, he's right.

15:37.269 --> 15:40.432
- You crooks in Washington-
- Put a sock in it, punk!

15:40.539 --> 15:45.033
Oh, you can silence me,
but you can't silence <i>Collier's</i> magazine.

15:45.144 --> 15:47.772
Tell the people!
Don't let the government push you around!

15:47.880 --> 15:49.848
You have a choice.
Fight back!

15:49.949 --> 15:52.850
I'm gonna write
the best darn article-

15:52.952 --> 15:55.682
Oh, wait.
[Grunts]

15:55.788 --> 15:57.756
- [All Groan]
- Hah!

15:57.856 --> 15:59.824
Take that, Uncle Sam!

16:04.263 --> 16:06.231
[Giggles]

16:17.543 --> 16:19.511
[Peacocks Squawk]

16:19.611 --> 16:23.206
Faster, Simpson.
Those jackbooted G-men won't be far behind.

16:23.315 --> 16:25.306
We'll hide out at my place.
I've got beer.

16:25.417 --> 16:30.787
No! We need help. There's only one man
who can get us out of a jam like this.

16:30.889 --> 16:33.357
## [Singing Show Tune]

16:36.562 --> 16:38.723
<i>[Doorbell Rings]</i>

16:38.831 --> 16:41.959
All right, all right.
Keep your top on.

16:44.236 --> 16:46.796
Why, sir, what a pleasant-
[Blathering]

16:48.207 --> 16:50.675
So now our own government
is hunting us down...

16:50.776 --> 16:54.735
- like a couple of common snow leopards.
- It's an outrage, sir.

16:54.847 --> 16:58.283
<i>[On Rolice Radio]</i>
<i>This is AgentJohnson from the F.B.I.</i>

16:58.384 --> 17:03.287
Be on the lookout for
a 1936 maroon Stutz Bearcat.

17:04.656 --> 17:07.181
Uh, that really was
more of a burgundy.

17:07.291 --> 17:09.260
Oh, we're never gonna make it.

17:09.361 --> 17:11.989
Let's just divide up the trillion now
and go our separate ways.

17:12.097 --> 17:14.759
Ah, I'm afraid we've got
to get out of the country.

17:14.867 --> 17:18.826
Capital idea. Let's blow
this fascist Popsicle stand.

17:18.936 --> 17:22.304
We'll purchase a small island
somewhere and start our own country...

17:22.407 --> 17:25.638
free from the relentless
tyranny of Uncle Sam.

17:25.743 --> 17:27.712
But I can't leave the country.

17:27.813 --> 17:31.078
- What about my wife and kids?
- That can be shipped.

17:31.183 --> 17:34.346
<i>Okay, kids.</i>
<i>I want some answers.</i>

17:34.453 --> 17:37.650
Where do you think your father
would go with a trillion dollars?

17:37.756 --> 17:40.486
My dad has a trillion dollars?
Wow!

17:40.592 --> 17:42.719
I can buy and sell your sorry ass.

17:42.828 --> 17:46.764
- I'll give you a billion dollars
to empty the cat box for me.
- No, no, Bart!

17:46.865 --> 17:49.265
That money's going toward
your college education.

17:49.368 --> 17:52.303
Who needs college, Mom?
We're trillionaires!

17:52.404 --> 17:54.372
Let's buy dune buggies!

17:58.710 --> 18:01.178
Contact.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.510
Remove the chocks, Simpson!

18:03.615 --> 18:05.515
Simpson?

18:07.719 --> 18:09.880
[Both Gasp]

18:09.988 --> 18:14.049
- [Groans]
- <i>[Mr. Burns] There's soda on the plane!</i>

18:17.629 --> 18:20.393
Attention, fugitives.
You are leaving U.S. jurisdiction.

18:20.499 --> 18:24.060
Turn back immediately
or we will be unable to prosecute you.

18:24.169 --> 18:28.970
- We better do what he says!
- Wait! We're now over international waters.

18:29.074 --> 18:31.770
Whoo-hoo! We can gamble! Yes!

18:34.179 --> 18:36.739
- Aw, nuts!
- They'll be back.

18:36.849 --> 18:40.410
They'll miss American TV.

18:40.519 --> 18:43.147
Any of these islands
would make a fine new country.

18:43.255 --> 18:45.883
- I call president!
- Vice president!
- [Groans]

18:45.991 --> 18:48.892
Ooh, there's a big one.

18:48.994 --> 18:51.292
And it has "freedom"
written all over it.

18:51.396 --> 18:53.489
Sir, that's Cuba.

18:53.599 --> 18:56.329
Cuba, eh?
Take her down, Smithers.

18:56.435 --> 18:59.165
Uh, you're flying the plane, sir.

18:59.271 --> 19:01.171
Excellent.

19:02.274 --> 19:04.242
<i>Sorry about the landing, boys.</i>

19:04.343 --> 19:07.574
<i>This fog is so thick,</i>
<i>I can't see my own cataracts.</i>

19:10.549 --> 19:12.847
Uh, purpose of visit?

19:17.923 --> 19:22.155
Oh, you're gonna love it in Cuba, Marge.
There's shredded pork everywhere!

19:22.261 --> 19:24.229
It's <i>carne de burro.</i>

19:24.329 --> 19:26.456
Nice to meet you.

19:28.100 --> 19:31.069
Ah, the new Packard
we've been hearing so much about.

19:35.107 --> 19:37.974
[Backfires]

19:38.076 --> 19:40.510

[Both Grunting]

19:45.284 --> 19:47.343
<i>[Spectators Booing]</i>

19:47.452 --> 19:50.182
So you say Batista's gone.

19:50.289 --> 19:52.655
- Did you know that?
- I had no idea.

19:52.758 --> 19:56.285
In that case, just take us
to whoever's in charge.

19:58.630 --> 20:00.928
Comrades, our nation
is completely bankrupt.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.763
We have no choice
but to abandon communism.

20:03.869 --> 20:06.394
- [All Groaning]
- I know, I know, I know.

20:06.505 --> 20:10.339
But we all knew from day one
this mumbo jumbo wouldn't fly.

20:10.442 --> 20:14.640
- [Man] Guess we're done!
- I'll call Washington and tell them they won.

20:14.746 --> 20:18.045
But, <i>Rresidente,</i>
America tried to kill you!

20:18.150 --> 20:22.678
Ah, they're not so bad. They even named
a street after me in San Francisco.

20:22.788 --> 20:25.689
- [Whispering, Indistinct]
- It's full of <i>what?</i>

20:25.791 --> 20:29.454
[Panting]
<i>Rresidente,</i> three men are here to see you.

20:29.561 --> 20:33.395
- They claim to have a trillion-dollar bill.
- <i>¡Ay, caramba!</i>

20:33.498 --> 20:36.490
Oh, so the island's
not for sale, eh?

20:36.602 --> 20:41.369
Well, will you at least permit us
to live in your socialist paradise?

20:41.473 --> 20:43.441
You're talking about Cuba?

20:43.542 --> 20:48.445
Exactly. All we ask is preferential treatment
because of my fabulous wealth.

20:48.547 --> 20:52.574
- May I see?
- [Chuckles]
See with your eyes, not with your hands.

20:52.684 --> 20:54.879
Please, we are all amigos here.

20:54.987 --> 21:00.357
Mr. Burns, I think we can trust
the president of Cuba.

21:04.763 --> 21:07.527
- Now give it back.
- Give what back?

21:07.633 --> 21:08.998
Ohh!

21:11.870 --> 21:17.172
It's hard to believe there's a place
worse than America. But we found it.

21:17.276 --> 21:21.235
Yes. I, too, feel a renewed appreciation
for the good old U.S. of A.

21:21.346 --> 21:27.080
Oppression and harassment are a small
price to pay to live in the land of the free.

21:27.185 --> 21:30.677
But, uh, sir, aren't you facing
some serious jail time?

21:30.789 --> 21:35.317
Well, if it's a crime to love one's country,
then I'm guilty.

21:35.427 --> 21:38.692
And if it's a crime to steal
a trillion dollars from our government...

21:38.797 --> 21:43.097
and hand it over to Communist Cuba,
then I'm guilty of that too.

21:43.201 --> 21:46.034
And if it's a crime
to bribe a jury...

21:46.138 --> 21:48.106
then so help me...

21:48.206 --> 21:50.970
I'll soon be guilty of that!

21:51.076 --> 21:53.510
God bless America!
