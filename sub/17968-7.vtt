I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:13.248 --> 00:15.081
(Both) Jaime, what's wrong?

00:15.166 --> 00:17.133
Well, I, um, I failed the test.

00:17.218 --> 00:18.551
(Both gasp)

00:18.587 --> 00:20.470
And I'm getting deported.

00:20.555 --> 00:23.389
Jaime, those old white dudes
are impossible to tell apart.

00:23.425 --> 00:24.674
I know, babe, I know.

(Sniffling)

00:27.228 --> 00:28.428
Just kidding!

00:28.513 --> 00:29.896
I passed the test!

00:29.931 --> 00:32.314
Ah... oh, man!

00:32.400 --> 00:34.183
Tomorrow I become a true American.

00:34.269 --> 00:35.485
I got you, I got you, I got you!

00:35.570 --> 00:37.103
- Yeah, Jaime!
- I believed you...

00:37.188 --> 00:39.105
It was scary.

00:39.190 --> 00:41.190
My heart, it was exploding.

00:41.276 --> 00:42.442
I'm so sorry.

00:42.559 --> 00:43.675
It's so good, though.

00:43.760 --> 00:45.927
Hemos, tonight is going to be a night

00:46.012 --> 00:49.013
that you are never, ever gonna forget.

00:49.065 --> 00:51.399
We are going to sail right
past the Statue of Liberty,

00:51.484 --> 00:53.317
like the true American immigrants did.

00:53.353 --> 00:54.986
It's unbelievable that we live in a city

00:55.021 --> 00:59.023
where our ancestors passed
through Ellis Island.

00:59.075 --> 01:01.025
Yeah... mine didn't.

01:03.830 --> 01:05.913

You're going so fast.

- Okay.

01:56.412 --> 01:58.496

- Yes.

01:58.548 --> 01:59.714
Thank you. Thank you so much.

Chrissy, did you not call...

02:08.675 --> 02:12.393
to change the confirmation

02:12.478 --> 02:16.814
Did you mess up my plans once again

02:16.850 --> 02:20.351
and not call to change?

02:20.436 --> 02:21.903
I'm so sorry, I forgot.

You know what, Jaime, this is your night.

03:55.281 --> 03:56.330
You're not waiting in line

03:56.416 --> 03:58.165
like some bridge and tunnel club meet.

03:58.251 --> 03:59.450
- It's okay.
- Yeah, you know what,

03:59.535 --> 04:01.002
why don't you guys go check out the view?

04:01.087 --> 04:02.036
We'll wait it out. What do you want?

04:02.121 --> 04:03.037
Really?

04:03.122 --> 04:05.172
Yeah.

04:05.258 --> 04:06.874
Okay, I want a gin and
vodka maraschino sizzle,

04:06.960 --> 04:09.510
okay, with curacao, and a...

04:09.595 --> 04:11.512
And a little splash of crème de menthe.

04:11.597 --> 04:13.431
That sounds good. I'll have one, too.

04:13.466 --> 04:14.632
- Okay.
- Two, coming up.

04:14.684 --> 04:15.967
Okay, bye.

04:16.019 --> 04:17.218

Melody and I have been looking
for you guys everywhere.

04:24.227 --> 04:26.444
She just went to the can,
she had to take a doody.

04:26.479 --> 04:28.696
I'm sure she'll be so happy you told us.

04:28.781 --> 04:30.448
You guys aren't waiting in
line for the bar, are you?

04:30.483 --> 04:31.816
You don't have to do that.

04:31.868 --> 04:33.985
(Whispering) I know where
they keep the liquor.

04:34.037 --> 04:35.319
Um, we're fine, waiting.

04:35.405 --> 04:37.872
What? No. Trust me,
I've sailed on this boat

04:37.957 --> 04:39.824
with Melody for 12 quarters now.

04:39.876 --> 04:41.492
I know all its secrets.

04:41.577 --> 04:44.128
The captain is a murderer.

04:44.163 --> 04:45.162
- What?
- Really?

04:45.248 --> 04:49.050
(Mocking) Yeah, really.

04:49.135 --> 04:51.836
They don't let murderers be captains.

04:51.888 --> 04:53.220
Come on, let's go.

04:53.306 --> 04:54.588
Come on, let's get some stuff.

04:54.674 --> 04:56.424
Come on, come on.

05:16.029 --> 05:18.329
Ah... all right.

05:25.204 --> 05:26.287
Whoa!

05:26.372 --> 05:29.040

05:34.097 --> 05:36.931

05:37.016 --> 05:39.266
Okay, let's just get the
drinks and go, all right?

05:39.352 --> 05:40.351

- Okay.

This is good.

05:48.061 --> 05:51.228
(Door clanking)

05:51.314 --> 05:53.697
It's locked?

05:53.733 --> 05:55.866
It's not my fault.

05:55.902 --> 05:57.701
Help, somebody!

05:57.737 --> 05:59.537
Rape! Rape!

05:59.572 --> 06:00.738
Dude!

06:00.790 --> 06:02.406
You're supposed to yell
"rape" in emergencies.

06:02.458 --> 06:04.542
No, it's "fire," you yell "fire."

06:04.577 --> 06:06.627
Oh, fine. Fire!

06:06.712 --> 06:08.412
- Fire!
- Hello!

06:08.464 --> 06:09.713
Wait, wait, move out of the way.

06:09.749 --> 06:10.748
I'm gonna ram the door.

06:10.833 --> 06:13.801
The man is gonna ram the door.

06:13.886 --> 06:16.587
Wanna see me ram it?

06:16.639 --> 06:20.091
Ah! (Bleep)

06:20.176 --> 06:21.225
(Bevers moaning)

06:21.260 --> 06:22.093
(Abbi) Are you okay?

06:22.178 --> 06:23.844
Well, yeah.

06:23.930 --> 06:25.062
Fire!

06:25.098 --> 06:27.398
Fire and rape!

06:27.433 --> 06:29.483
Rape and fire!

06:29.569 --> 06:30.601
Fire rape!

06:31.810 --> 06:34.028
Still no service. Uhh!

06:34.811 --> 06:35.893
I honestly have always thought

06:35.979 --> 06:38.346
that we'd die in each other's arms at sea.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.680
Ah! Balls.

06:39.766 --> 06:43.351
Sorry, Abbi, I broke
your Starbucks gift card.

06:43.436 --> 06:45.353
Bevers, I still had $17 on that.

06:45.438 --> 06:46.437
Well, maybe now you can

06:46.522 --> 06:48.356
start supporting local businesses.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.608
Listen, there are 250 lawyers on this boat.

06:50.693 --> 06:52.443
These guys drink a lot.

06:52.528 --> 06:54.996
So, if each one of them has
at least three drinks per hour,

06:55.031 --> 06:58.165
that's 750 drinks every hour.

06:58.201 --> 07:00.701
What is this, the 2400 point SAT?

07:00.753 --> 07:01.702
(Mocking) No, silly.

07:01.788 --> 07:03.204
(Normal voice) It's simple math.

07:03.256 --> 07:06.424
They're gonna have to restock
the bar in 20 to 25 minutes.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.759
We only wanna hang out with
each other anyway, right?

07:08.845 --> 07:11.128
(Chuckling)

07:11.214 --> 07:12.380
So, what's the vibe gonna be like

07:12.465 --> 07:14.382
at the naturalization ceremony?

07:14.434 --> 07:17.218
Can I wear my American flag
tie, or would that be too gauche?

07:17.303 --> 07:21.055
Hold on, I'm gonna be wearing
my American flag contact lenses.

07:21.140 --> 07:22.056
Yeah, they burn me very badly.

07:22.141 --> 07:23.524
I should stop.

07:23.559 --> 07:26.394
Hey, cheers to you, dude,
for becoming a citizen,

07:26.446 --> 07:29.647
and also to me... this is
my first time ever on a boat.

07:29.732 --> 07:31.532
No, really?

07:31.567 --> 07:32.733
No, prank, man.

07:32.819 --> 07:33.951
I'm a well-to-do dentist,

07:34.037 --> 07:35.620
of course I've been on a boat before.

07:35.705 --> 07:37.071
- Ah, you got me.
- Cheers.

07:40.043 --> 07:42.126
That is how we cheers in Latin America.

07:42.211 --> 07:44.629
- Really?
- No, man, prank, bitch.

07:44.714 --> 07:45.630
(Both laughing)

07:45.715 --> 07:47.581
I'm stealin' that one.

07:50.670 --> 07:51.752
(Abbi) Okay, I got one.

07:51.804 --> 07:54.839
Captain Morgan...

07:54.924 --> 07:59.760
Jack Daniels, Svedka vodka, robot...

07:59.846 --> 08:01.095
(Ilana) Easy... kill the dudes,

08:01.180 --> 08:04.265
(bleep) and marry that robot.

08:04.350 --> 08:05.599
You guys know that human-robot marriage

08:05.685 --> 08:09.186
is gonna be the civil
rights issue of our lifetime?

08:09.272 --> 08:10.438
Oh, really?

08:10.490 --> 08:11.656
(Bevers) I got one.

08:11.741 --> 08:16.444
Would you rather drink a cup of mayonnaise,

08:16.529 --> 08:19.914
or a cup of jazz?

08:19.949 --> 08:21.582
What the (Bleep) is jazz?

08:21.617 --> 08:24.452
You know, you jerk off and jazz shoots out.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.620
I knew that that was
gonna be something awful.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.205
Why did we ask?

08:28.291 --> 08:29.457
I like to call it jazz

08:29.542 --> 08:31.759
because it comes out of my horn

08:31.794 --> 08:33.760
and you never know where it's gonna go.

08:33.796 --> 08:36.630
That is so gross.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.131
(With Patois accent) Me
hearing a lot of chitchat.

08:38.183 --> 08:41.635
Me don't hear you answering
that question, why?

08:41.721 --> 08:43.187
And you never will.

08:43.272 --> 08:44.555
I would chug the jazz.

08:44.640 --> 08:47.141
(Chuckling)

08:47.193 --> 08:49.110
(Jaime) Lincoln, can I tell you a secret?

08:49.145 --> 08:51.195
I want to practice talking
in an American accent,

08:51.280 --> 08:52.730
but I'm very scared.

08:52.815 --> 08:55.232
You're in international
waters, man, spread your wings.

08:55.318 --> 08:57.485
Okay, I do this for you.

08:57.570 --> 08:58.986
Um...

08:59.072 --> 09:02.907
(American accent) I love hamburgers...

09:02.992 --> 09:05.960
and I love DUI's.

09:05.995 --> 09:07.712
(Man) Hey, bro, do I know
you from Michigan state?

09:07.797 --> 09:09.213
Were you Delta Sig?

09:09.298 --> 09:11.749
Eh...

09:11.834 --> 09:13.718
(American accent) That's correct, bro-sef.

09:13.803 --> 09:16.721
I was a frat bro upon the campus.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.005
I knew it.

09:25.565 --> 09:29.183
Uh, Abbi, I don't think
anybody washed those.

09:29.268 --> 09:32.853
I don't even care, I
am so hungry right now.

09:32.905 --> 09:37.074
You're in luck, you can
eat some of my shrimp.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.693
Bevers, why do you have
shrimp in your pocket?

09:39.779 --> 09:41.612
Because the shrimp is
always the first thing

09:41.697 --> 09:43.330
to get eaten on these boats.

09:43.366 --> 09:45.833
I gave you a ziploc
this morning, did I not?

09:45.868 --> 09:49.537
And she is occupato.

09:49.622 --> 09:51.422
You're welcome.

09:51.507 --> 09:53.507
Dude, check this out.

09:53.543 --> 09:56.010
(Abbi) Oh, my God.

09:56.045 --> 09:57.178
Whoopsie.

09:57.213 --> 09:59.213
It was supposed to be a surprise.

09:59.298 --> 10:03.267
I'm gonna propose to Melody tonight.

10:03.352 --> 10:06.220
(Vocalizing dramatic
fanfare) Bom-bom bwooom.

10:09.192 --> 10:10.107
I really haven't thought about it,

10:10.193 --> 10:12.143
but I'd be posh spice.

10:12.228 --> 10:13.477
Oh, you're so posh spice.

10:13.563 --> 10:15.062
I wish there could've
been like, a Latina one

10:15.114 --> 10:16.697
called "the spicy spice,"

10:16.732 --> 10:18.199
but this is just a fantasy of mine.

10:18.234 --> 10:20.451
Open your eyes, man.

10:20.536 --> 10:23.571
Shakira is spicy spice.

10:23.656 --> 10:25.956
Oh... my God.

10:26.042 --> 10:27.658
You're a genius.

10:27.743 --> 10:29.076
Wait, this is insane.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.245
I mean, have you even
talked to Melody about this?

10:31.297 --> 10:34.715
No, but we've been dating
for like, 12 quarters.

10:34.750 --> 10:37.301
I mean, three years.

10:37.386 --> 10:38.469
It just feels like it's time.

10:38.554 --> 10:40.004
Besides, we already live together.

10:40.089 --> 10:42.723
No, you do not live together.

10:42.758 --> 10:44.058
You have your own apartment.

10:44.093 --> 10:45.259
Jesus!

10:48.264 --> 10:50.681
Does this mean that you'd be moving out?

10:50.766 --> 10:52.149
I've been dreading this conversation,

10:52.235 --> 10:56.654
but, yeah, I know, I
feel sad about it, too.

10:56.739 --> 10:57.905
I actually wanted to ask you, though,

10:57.940 --> 11:00.658
if you would be my best man.

11:00.743 --> 11:02.610
Bevers, you have four brothers.

11:02.662 --> 11:06.413
But, I feel like you're the
one who really, really gets me.

11:06.449 --> 11:07.615
When we get out of here,

11:07.667 --> 11:10.284
I'm gonna pop the big
"Q" in front of everybody.

11:10.369 --> 11:12.453
I already worked it all out with the DJ.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.505
I'm such a showboat.

11:14.590 --> 11:16.674
This is rude, I'm sorry, but bride marriage

11:16.759 --> 11:18.626
keeps women treated like property.

11:18.711 --> 11:20.294
I thought all women wanted to get married.

11:20.379 --> 11:23.297
- Wake up, Bevers.
- Yeah, one day.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.799
No offense, but women
don't hit their sexual peak

11:25.885 --> 11:29.887
until their extremely late 30's.

11:29.972 --> 11:31.355
I just feel like you guys are young

11:31.440 --> 11:33.440
to be lockin' it down.

11:33.476 --> 11:35.809
Government-mandated
monogamy is for old people,

11:35.895 --> 11:39.146
like Facebook invites or network TV.

11:39.232 --> 11:41.232
Or it's not, Ilana.

11:41.317 --> 11:43.701
Bevers, you love this woman.

11:43.786 --> 11:46.787
She is your lock and key.

11:46.822 --> 11:48.789
Marry her, start a new life together,

11:48.824 --> 11:50.658
get a new apartment.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.127
Go for it, man.

11:53.162 --> 11:56.830
I'm the king of America!

11:56.916 --> 11:58.215
All right, switch, now I get to be Rose.

11:58.301 --> 11:59.166
Okay, okay.

11:59.252 --> 12:00.384
I'm confused.

12:00.469 --> 12:03.637
You and Lincoln seem like
a pretty serious couple.

12:03.673 --> 12:04.972
We're sex friends...

12:05.007 --> 12:09.727
although we haven't had
sex in like, four days.

12:09.812 --> 12:12.146
You know, today I was
actually with him all day,

12:12.181 --> 12:14.932
but I didn't see his dick once.

12:15.017 --> 12:16.767
Melody and I haven't had sex in weeks,

12:16.852 --> 12:17.851
on purpose, though.

12:17.904 --> 12:18.852
It's called "edging."

12:18.938 --> 12:19.937
Edging?

12:20.022 --> 12:21.105
It's like when you

12:21.190 --> 12:22.690
get yourself super aroused,

12:22.742 --> 12:24.525
but you don't blow your orgasm,

12:24.610 --> 12:26.243
you never blow your orgasm.

12:26.329 --> 12:27.778
You know how whales have that blow hole?

12:27.863 --> 12:29.163
Yeah, o... okay.

12:29.198 --> 12:32.833
Ab, do you think Lincoln
and I are like a "couple"?

12:32.868 --> 12:34.034
I don't know, I mean, you've been spending

12:34.120 --> 12:35.619
a lot more time with him lately, right?

12:35.705 --> 12:36.870
And if you're not having sex,

12:36.956 --> 12:38.923
he's either your boyfriend
or your best friend.

12:39.008 --> 12:39.873
Ow!

12:39.959 --> 12:41.208
You are my best friend!

12:41.260 --> 12:43.344
Don't you ever call anybody else that!

12:43.379 --> 12:44.712
What the (Bleep)?

12:44.797 --> 12:46.547
He's not my boyfriend!

12:46.599 --> 12:48.766
I'm wild and I'm free!

12:48.851 --> 12:51.602
I'm a sexual X-man, I'm Wolverine.

12:51.687 --> 12:53.687
I'm Vulva-rine.

12:53.723 --> 12:55.139
(Bevers with British
accent) Me thinks the lady

12:55.224 --> 12:58.559
doth protest too much.

12:58.644 --> 12:59.893
Ew!

12:59.946 --> 13:01.562
(Screaming)

13:04.233 --> 13:07.368
Let us out!

13:07.403 --> 13:08.619
God!

13:08.704 --> 13:10.654
Jesus.

13:10.740 --> 13:14.375
What are you guys doing in there?

13:14.410 --> 13:15.909
It smells like balls in here.

13:18.331 --> 13:19.580
No, no! My Insulin!

13:21.638 --> 13:22.920
(Ilana) If Lincoln and I are a couple,

13:22.972 --> 13:26.090
it's like, why did my
ancestors even come here?

13:26.176 --> 13:27.258
(Abbi) I don't know.

13:27.343 --> 13:29.343
Why don't you just have sex with Lincoln?

13:29.429 --> 13:31.596
And then you're back
to being friends, right?

13:31.681 --> 13:34.265
You got beauty, you got brains,

13:34.350 --> 13:35.316
you're a (Bleep) genius.

13:35.401 --> 13:36.434
Do you want a kiss?

13:36.519 --> 13:38.019
That's okay. Are you sure?

13:38.104 --> 13:39.487
Abbi! Ilana!

13:39.572 --> 13:42.156
Oh... saved by the bell.

13:42.242 --> 13:43.858

13:43.943 --> 13:44.992
Where have you been?

13:45.078 --> 13:47.161
Oh, it's coming.

13:47.247 --> 13:49.113
(Lincoln) We were looking
everywhere for you.

13:49.199 --> 13:52.083
Except, we forgot to look for you.

13:52.118 --> 13:54.585
Hey, do either of you
two have like, a knife?

13:54.621 --> 13:56.838
Because me and Lincoln want
to become blood brothers.

13:56.923 --> 13:57.839
Blood brothers.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.590

Abbi, I need you to go talk to Melody.

17:13.486 --> 17:16.988
She's in the bathroom again,
but she's not doodying.

17:17.040 --> 17:19.490
She thought I was gonna propose,

17:19.541 --> 17:22.660
and she says I embarrassed
her in front of her whole firm.

17:22.744 --> 17:24.161
Why didn't you propose?

17:24.213 --> 17:25.329
Because of you.

17:25.381 --> 17:26.497
You and Ilana made me realize

17:26.582 --> 17:27.665
that we shouldn't be getting married yet.

17:27.717 --> 17:28.966
We're too young.

17:29.002 --> 17:30.251
So, you told everyone I'm transitioning

17:30.336 --> 17:32.136
into becoming a man.

17:32.171 --> 17:33.721
All the lawyers are now into me.

17:33.806 --> 17:36.474
Oh, you're way too good
for any of these lawyers.

17:36.509 --> 17:38.926
Thanks.

17:39.012 --> 17:40.344
Please, will you help me?

17:40.430 --> 17:43.014
I love Melody so much,
but she won't talk to me.

17:43.099 --> 17:45.016
Can you just go talk girl stuff to her?

17:47.687 --> 17:49.687
Fine.

17:49.739 --> 17:50.855
Don't get too sloppy.

17:50.907 --> 17:53.324
I need you to be on top of your game.

17:55.361 --> 17:57.411
Melody, it's Abbi.

17:57.497 --> 18:00.698
I just wanna say first that I'm not...

18:00.783 --> 18:02.199
I'm not becoming a man.

18:02.251 --> 18:05.536
That was weird and confusing.

18:05.588 --> 18:07.705
But I... I know that you're upset,

18:07.757 --> 18:10.007
um, and it's none of my business,

18:10.043 --> 18:11.959
but I know how much Bevers loves you,

18:12.045 --> 18:14.879
and I know that you... you love him, too,

18:14.931 --> 18:16.597
for some reason, and as much as I hate

18:16.682 --> 18:18.215
that he's always in our apartment,

18:18.267 --> 18:22.219
'cause it's a lot... he's there a lot.

18:22.305 --> 18:24.055
Like, listen, I think we
need to actually schedule

18:24.140 --> 18:26.774
a time to talk about that,
like, just the two of us,

18:26.859 --> 18:29.944
'cause he just eats all of my stuff.

18:30.029 --> 18:33.481
He's not my cup of tea, but
he really cares about you.

18:33.566 --> 18:36.150
And I just hope that you know that

18:36.235 --> 18:38.736
even though he didn't propose,

18:38.788 --> 18:41.572
that doesn't make what you
guys have any less special.

18:41.657 --> 18:44.658
It doesn't.

18:44.744 --> 18:48.079
I would love for someone
to love me like that.

18:48.164 --> 18:50.081
I love you like that.

18:50.133 --> 18:52.666
Ilana? What the (Bleep).

18:52.752 --> 18:54.752
Don't be mad, please.

18:54.837 --> 18:56.087
Were you having sex in there?

18:56.172 --> 18:57.421
We were just wiping up.

18:57.473 --> 18:58.556
Where the (Bleep) is Melody?

19:01.511 --> 19:02.560
Hi.

19:02.595 --> 19:04.261
(Ilana) Jaime, I am so sorry.

19:04.347 --> 19:06.814
We almost missed this moment.

19:06.899 --> 19:09.984
Tonight, you know, I ate
for free, I drank for free.

19:10.069 --> 19:11.102
I made out with a very straight man

19:11.154 --> 19:13.938
by the fire extinguisher, too.

19:14.023 --> 19:16.440
This is what America is
really about, I think.

19:16.526 --> 19:20.694
Abbi, thank you so much for
talking to Melody for me.

19:20.780 --> 19:22.580
I did not talk to Melody.

19:22.615 --> 19:25.249
I have not seen her at all tonight.

19:25.284 --> 19:26.500
Oh, really?

19:26.586 --> 19:28.752
Well, somebody must've sweet-talked her,

19:28.788 --> 19:31.455
'cause we just boned in a lifeboat.

19:31.507 --> 19:33.707
There was so much jazz.

19:33.793 --> 19:34.925
(Shivering)

19:34.961 --> 19:36.293
There she is.

19:36.379 --> 19:38.429
Oh, she's so beautiful.

19:38.464 --> 19:40.798
(Orchestra playing "America the Beautiful")

19:43.686 --> 19:44.885
(Lincoln) Ow, my dick.

19:44.971 --> 19:46.220
It's too romantic, I'm sorry.

19:46.305 --> 19:47.972
Ah, we just had sex.

19:48.057 --> 19:49.273
It's still sore.

19:49.308 --> 19:51.892
I'm in my refractory period,
you gotta let me rebuild.

19:51.978 --> 19:53.144
Fine, I'll be gentler.

19:53.196 --> 19:56.113
(Orchestra playing "America the Beautiful")

19:56.149 --> 19:57.781
- Ah, romantic again.
- Ilana!

19:59.491 --> 20:01.225
(man on PA) Frederick Chu.

20:01.293 --> 20:02.360
(applause)

20:02.428 --> 20:04.595
Alia Hanoon.

20:04.663 --> 20:05.863
(Ilana) Cute. I'm into it.

20:05.931 --> 20:07.298
(Abbi) Oh, my God.

20:07.366 --> 20:08.299
That's disgusting.

20:08.367 --> 20:10.700
That's disgusting, right?

20:10.768 --> 20:12.302
Oh, Guy Fieri.

20:12.370 --> 20:14.671
I could roll with that,
he's go a good life.

20:14.738 --> 20:19.642
He's always in that
convertible, gettin' food.

20:19.710 --> 20:21.945
Oh, my God, you look so
good with Bieber hair.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.846
You should honestly get that
now, I'm not even kidding.

20:23.914 --> 20:25.148
Ew, no.

20:25.216 --> 20:26.683
I really feel like you fit as these dudes.

20:26.750 --> 20:27.784
I... I'd (bleep) 'em all.

20:27.851 --> 20:29.418
I really appreciate that,

20:29.486 --> 20:33.822
but I think it's more important
for me to be a woman right now.

20:33.890 --> 20:35.057
Lincoln, did you see this?

20:35.125 --> 20:36.825
I'm sorry, I'm too hung over.

20:36.893 --> 20:40.329
My eyes can't focus on
a fixed point right now.

20:40.397 --> 20:42.298
(man on PA) Jaime Castro.

20:42.365 --> 20:44.967
(cheering)

20:45.034 --> 20:46.469
Ow! Ow!

20:47.270 --> 20:51.840
(triumphant fanfare)
