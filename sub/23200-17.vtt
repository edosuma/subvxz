00:29.413 --> 00:31.288
Wait for me here, boys.

00:33.370 --> 00:34.412
Henshaw.

00:34.495 --> 00:35.995
Perfect timing.

00:52.782 --> 00:56.489
What is this, Dunfield?
I hate crowds. You know that.

00:56.823 --> 00:59.113
The Secretary of State insisted.

00:59.197 --> 01:02.820
I didn't come all this way into town
to be put on display, for Pete's sake.

01:02.904 --> 01:04.654
Government protocol.

01:05.069 --> 01:07.778
All right. Let's get it over with.

01:16.275 --> 01:18.775
Greetings, Mr. Henshaw, from my people...

01:18.858 --> 01:22.149
to the most distinguished captain
of industry on Earth.

01:22.232 --> 01:25.774
I salute the richest man
in the Western Hemisphere.

01:26.398 --> 01:29.439
And I salute
the most eminent Prime Minister...

01:29.522 --> 01:33.438
of our great European friend and ally.

01:33.521 --> 01:37.103
I particularly salute
the greatest scientific genius ever-

01:37.187 --> 01:38.479
All right.

01:38.811 --> 01:41.020
- Hi, Primo.
- Hi, Marshall.

01:42.186 --> 01:45.102
It's an honor finally to meet you in person.

01:45.768 --> 01:48.684
I understand that not too many people
have done so.

01:48.767 --> 01:52.267
Well, it's not every day
that something as important as Missy...

01:52.349 --> 01:54.016
is bought and sold.

01:54.182 --> 01:55.266
"Missy"?

01:58.764 --> 02:02.055
Missile Systems Scrambler.
"Missy" is a pet name.

02:02.389 --> 02:05.763
"Missy" is very deceptive,
considering that it can...

02:06.179 --> 02:08.721
deprogram the guidance system
of any armed missile...

02:08.804 --> 02:10.429
within a radius of 500 miles.

02:10.512 --> 02:13.720
You can call and tell the Prime Minister
that she doesn't have to worry...

02:13.803 --> 02:17.927
about the nuclear-armed nations
that surround her country. Not anymore.

02:18.009 --> 02:19.343
Good. It checks out, then.

02:19.427 --> 02:22.967
I can, and will, attest that this device
is in operating condition...

02:23.050 --> 02:27.466
and that it's what Olivera agreed
to purchase from Henshaw International.

02:27.590 --> 02:31.090
Great. If you will sign this
while I make a phone call.

02:55.666 --> 02:57.958
Good. Thanks, Diana. Yeah, bye.

03:00.707 --> 03:02.332
Our people just verified it.

03:02.415 --> 03:05.539
The scrambler, Missy?
It's all ready to be shipped.

03:05.790 --> 03:09.288
How about that? You have the word
of the Inter Agency Defense Command...

03:09.371 --> 03:11.371
that you're getting a square deal.

03:11.455 --> 03:14.245
I never thought for one instant
that I was not.

03:14.329 --> 03:17.870
It's just that there are so many people
who would stop at nothing...

03:17.953 --> 03:21.660
to obtain illegally
what I have just bought from you.

04:14.772 --> 04:17.188
I could've sworn it was a gunshot.

04:20.396 --> 04:21.728
Let's get moving.

04:29.559 --> 04:32.309
All right. Let's get this thing loaded up.

04:52.845 --> 04:55.345
You're not my driver. Who are you?

04:55.428 --> 04:58.968
Time for the world's richest man
to go for a little ride.

06:25.613 --> 06:28.446
We've got to get everything off,
labels and all.

06:30.320 --> 06:32.819
Nice of Mr. Henshaw
to let so few people know...

06:32.903 --> 06:34.778
what he really looks like.

06:34.861 --> 06:39.067
Without any ID, it'll take him 10 years
to convince anyone who he is.

06:39.318 --> 06:43.442
Now, let's find a nice out-of-the-way spot
to dump him off.

07:00.438 --> 07:01.770
Here we go.

07:02.812 --> 07:04.769
Here we go. "Lost dogs. "

07:06.186 --> 07:07.519
Let me see.

07:08.644 --> 07:11.435
What about "Casper"? Is that your name?

07:12.226 --> 07:14.892
Casper! Here, boy.

07:16.434 --> 07:17.808
No Casper.

07:19.974 --> 07:23.099
There's no reward for finding a dog
named Casper anyway.

07:23.181 --> 07:26.848
Let's see. What about "Fluffy"?

07:27.098 --> 07:30.680
Is that your name? Fluffy!

07:32.471 --> 07:34.304
Okay. No Fluffy.

07:35.554 --> 07:38.928
I wouldn't be caught dead
feeding a dog named Fluffy.

07:39.261 --> 07:41.635
Let's see. What about...

07:43.468 --> 07:44.677
"Jason. "

07:45.301 --> 07:46.968
What about "Jason"?

07:47.967 --> 07:50.217
Is that your name? Hey, Jason.

07:51.424 --> 07:54.216
Here, boy. Jason!

07:54.924 --> 07:59.090
Jason, good dog. That's my boy.
That's my dog.

07:59.464 --> 08:01.255
Let's see, Jason. Good boy.

08:01.339 --> 08:05.129
Let's see. You're worth $50.

08:08.086 --> 08:12.044
Heck, you should be feeding me.
That's a good boy.

08:12.294 --> 08:14.710
Well, Jason, eat right up there, champ...

08:14.793 --> 08:18.459
'cause you and me
are gonna go for a little walk.

08:19.167 --> 08:21.708
One that's gonna make me
a very rich man.

08:26.498 --> 08:28.498
Excuse me,
could I speak to you for a minute?

08:28.582 --> 08:30.165
Sure. Excuse me.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.455
Everything went without a hitch, Colonel.

08:35.538 --> 08:37.371
Diana's tailing the furniture van...

08:37.455 --> 08:40.746
and apparently no one suspects
what's really inside.

08:41.120 --> 08:44.202
Good. The Secretary of State
will be glad to hear that.

08:44.285 --> 08:47.785
If anything happened to that scrambler
while it's still in the country...

08:47.869 --> 08:50.451
could trigger
a very messy international incident.

08:50.534 --> 08:53.992
It's about 60 miles from here
to the Prime Minister's private freighter.

08:54.075 --> 08:57.657
So in about an hour and a half from now,
we can all relax.

08:57.740 --> 08:59.365
Especially Diana.

09:46.853 --> 09:49.685
Jason! Come back here!

09:52.268 --> 09:53.435
Great.

09:58.100 --> 10:02.099
Thank you very much, mister.
I just lost $50.

10:02.974 --> 10:05.557
- So I'll buy you another dog.
- He wasn't mine.

10:05.640 --> 10:09.014
- So I'll steal you one.
- I didn't steal him. He's a runaway.

10:09.097 --> 10:12.513
I was gonna bring him in for a reward. $50.

10:12.597 --> 10:16.054
All right. I owe you $50.

10:20.386 --> 10:22.635
You don't look like
you could pay me 50 cents.

10:22.719 --> 10:24.177
What happened?

10:25.635 --> 10:28.134
I was getting into the ambulance...

10:28.593 --> 10:29.884
and they jumped me.

10:29.967 --> 10:32.966
They took my wallet, my watch...

10:33.049 --> 10:35.966
my credit cards, keys, everything.

10:36.049 --> 10:38.798
- You got mugged in an ambulance?
- I'll murder them.

10:38.881 --> 10:40.298
Listen, mister...

10:40.381 --> 10:43.006
maybe you could give me an IOU
on the $50.

10:43.380 --> 10:45.879
- Where do you live, kid?
- Back there.

10:45.963 --> 10:47.796
- Let's go.
- "Let's go"?

10:47.879 --> 10:50.421
Yeah, somebody's in a lot of trouble.

10:54.002 --> 10:56.794
It's gonna be you, if I don't get my money.

13:03.594 --> 13:05.053
Are you okay?

13:06.344 --> 13:10.051
The brakes went out.
They told me this thing was brand new.

13:10.926 --> 13:13.966
- That sounds a little strange, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

13:24.964 --> 13:27.880
This, I take it, is not a standard feature?

13:28.047 --> 13:29.296
Heck, no.

13:29.796 --> 13:33.754
In that case, you better step back.

13:43.917 --> 13:45.917
That was under my bumper?

13:46.833 --> 13:50.708
Apparently, someone wanted to make sure
that this van was destroyed in a crash.

13:50.790 --> 13:54.623
The van and whatever
was supposed to be inside.

13:57.997 --> 14:00.454
One more dent is not gonna matter.

14:24.907 --> 14:26.532
It's been stolen.

14:28.198 --> 14:29.406
Great.

14:40.861 --> 14:43.361
You're certain the driver of the van
was not involved?

14:43.569 --> 14:45.194
I'm positive, Steve.

14:45.276 --> 14:47.068
The switch had to be made at the factory.

14:47.235 --> 14:49.859
Right. I'm going back there now.

14:49.943 --> 14:53.192
It might not be a bad idea
to get hold of Marshall Henshaw.

14:53.274 --> 14:54.524
Okay, I'll work on it.

14:54.608 --> 14:55.899
I'll pass the word along here.

14:55.982 --> 14:58.106
- Goodbye, Diana.
- Bye, Steve.

15:01.522 --> 15:03.189
Excuse me, Prime Minister.

15:03.272 --> 15:05.688
I have some news concerning Missy.

15:05.980 --> 15:09.353
It has arrived at the dock, right on time.

15:09.479 --> 15:11.770
No. I'm afraid I have bad news.

15:26.683 --> 15:30.181
- What is this?
- What does it look like?

15:31.181 --> 15:34.347
Wait a minute, kid.
I haven't got time for games.

15:34.472 --> 15:37.888
This isn't where you live?

15:39.513 --> 15:42.345
Sure is. Is there something wrong with it?

15:42.928 --> 15:45.845
- Where's your family?
- I never had any.

15:47.386 --> 15:50.510
- So where did you run away from?
- A lot of places.

15:50.593 --> 15:53.759
Two orphanages, six foster homes,
one great aunt.

15:56.342 --> 15:59.675
Sorry to hear that, kid.
But I gotta make a phone call.

16:00.549 --> 16:02.340
Wait a minute, buddy.

16:03.298 --> 16:05.339
You and I got something
to settle here first.

16:05.422 --> 16:07.506
Look, you'll get your money for the dog...

16:07.589 --> 16:09.172
and then some. I promise.

16:09.256 --> 16:11.796
- When?
- As soon as I make the phone call.

16:11.879 --> 16:14.921
I'll tell my chauffeur to make sure
he's got $50 in his pocket...

16:15.003 --> 16:16.087
when he picks me up.

16:16.170 --> 16:17.795
- Chauffeur?
- Yeah.

16:18.045 --> 16:21.002
I think the muggers hit you on the head
a little too hard.

16:21.086 --> 16:23.960
Not hard enough. See you later, kid.

16:26.001 --> 16:29.209
You better tell your chauffeur
to bring you something else, too.

16:29.292 --> 16:32.124
- What's that?
- Money. For the phone call.

16:32.291 --> 16:33.665
Good point.

16:36.623 --> 16:38.956
- What's your name, kid?
- Barney.

16:39.039 --> 16:40.580
- Mine's Marshall.
- Hi.

16:40.663 --> 16:44.413
Barney, would you lend
your old pal Marshall a couple of dimes?

16:44.497 --> 16:48.329
Wait a minute,
you want me to give you money...

16:48.454 --> 16:51.952
so I can get the money
that you already owe me?

16:52.494 --> 16:57.160
- Happens all the time in my line of work.
- Sounds like my type of occupation.

16:57.243 --> 17:00.783
I'll tell you all about it,
as soon as I make the phone call.

17:00.867 --> 17:03.450
All right. I've been meaning
to go to the bank anyway.

17:03.533 --> 17:06.490
- For 20 cents, you gotta go to the bank?
- Yeah, sort of.

17:07.656 --> 17:10.115
This, here, is my rainy-day account.

17:10.196 --> 17:12.821
It's for days when whackos in the woods...

17:12.905 --> 17:15.571
do away with my other means of support.

17:24.111 --> 17:26.027
Hello. The I.R.A. C. computer...

17:26.111 --> 17:29.152
is temporarily unable to take your call.

17:29.235 --> 17:31.568
Please, stay on the line...

17:31.651 --> 17:35.275
and your call will be answered
as soon as possible.

17:35.733 --> 17:38.357
Hello. The I.R.A. C. computer-

17:38.440 --> 17:41.481
Next time I call,
he'll have an answering service.

17:41.731 --> 17:45.106
This is the I.R.A.C. computer.
To whom am I speaking?

17:45.814 --> 17:46.897
Take a guess.

17:46.981 --> 17:50.354
- Good morning, Steve Trevor.
- Ira, who have you been talking with?

17:50.479 --> 17:52.437
That is none of your business.

17:52.728 --> 17:55.144
Been playing chess
with the police computer again?

17:55.228 --> 17:58.936
The I.R.A. C. computer does not engage in
activities of a-

17:59.019 --> 18:02.018
- Are you winning?
- Naturally.

18:02.267 --> 18:05.267
All right, between moves,
how about doing a little research for me?

18:05.351 --> 18:06.475
Shoot.

18:06.558 --> 18:10.432
It's important that Diana or I get in touch
with Marshall Henshaw.

18:10.641 --> 18:14.224
The Marshall Henshaw?
Head of Henshaw International?

18:14.348 --> 18:15.473
Yeah, that's the guy.

18:15.556 --> 18:19.514
- He values his privacy above all else.
- Yes, I know, Ira.

18:20.180 --> 18:24.054
- Few people know what he looks like.
- I know, Ira.

18:24.596 --> 18:28.761
- Even fewer know how to contact him.
- Ira, I realize that.

18:29.303 --> 18:31.510
Your request is next to impossible.

18:32.135 --> 18:34.635
- You're terrific.
- Do not forget it.

18:35.967 --> 18:38.967
Look, I'm gonna have Diana call you
in exactly 30 minutes...

18:39.051 --> 18:42.716
so try and keep the line open, will you?
By the way...

18:43.091 --> 18:46.132
the woman whose voice is on the tape?

18:46.215 --> 18:51.130
- Quite effective, is she not?
- That's an understatement. Who is she?

18:52.796 --> 18:54.963
Hello, Ira?

18:57.628 --> 18:59.253
I bet he did that on purpose.

19:02.003 --> 19:03.502
Okay, thank you.

19:03.752 --> 19:06.168
They can't reach Mr. Henshaw,
but that's not unusual.

19:06.252 --> 19:09.459
I have to get in touch with
whoever's in charge of this warehouse...

19:09.542 --> 19:11.250
as soon as possible. Okay?

19:11.333 --> 19:13.624
Hang on. I'll see if she's in.

19:13.874 --> 19:15.499
- She?
- Yeah.

19:39.284 --> 19:43.034
- How did we do?
- We made $3.80.

19:43.159 --> 19:45.283
Good. We can use it all. Taxi!

19:45.367 --> 19:48.074
Wait a minute.
I thought you only had to make a call.

19:48.157 --> 19:50.990
It's better if we take a taxi
and talk to Dunfield in person.

19:51.074 --> 19:54.739
He should still be at the hotel.
Besides, that phone call idea was before...

19:54.822 --> 19:58.404
I knew you had access to such
voluminous monetary resources.

19:59.237 --> 20:00.488
Taxi!

20:00.780 --> 20:04.903
Hang on, kid. You're about to see
what power and money are all about.

20:08.402 --> 20:12.234
- Missy was inspected by your man at...
-9:43 this morning.

20:12.443 --> 20:15.942
- Exactly 9:43.
- And it was loaded into your van at...

20:16.192 --> 20:17.775
Exactly 9:50.

20:18.025 --> 20:21.982
There's no way that case could've
been switched after it was loaded.

20:22.107 --> 20:24.607
So in that seven minutes
the switch was made.

20:24.690 --> 20:25.731
Right.

20:25.814 --> 20:29.272
My guess is that whoever was responsible
would then have removed Missy...

20:29.355 --> 20:31.605
from your warehouse as soon as possible.

20:31.688 --> 20:33.313
Here's what we're looking for.

20:33.396 --> 20:35.770
A shipment of electronic equipment
went out at 10:00.

20:35.854 --> 20:39.103
Some trucks have come in.
But nothing's scheduled to leave till 1:00.

20:39.186 --> 20:40.686
Where was this equipment headed?

20:40.769 --> 20:43.518
Norfolk water and Power plant,
98th and Washington.

20:43.601 --> 20:45.476
- You're going out there?
- Yes.

20:45.601 --> 20:49.517
Meanwhile, I intend to have some of our
field agents go through your warehouse...

20:49.600 --> 20:53.057
and question your personnel.
I know it is a little inconvenient...

20:53.141 --> 20:56.223
but Missy may still be here.
Although I doubt it.

20:56.640 --> 20:57.931
I understand.

20:58.432 --> 21:01.888
And about those shipments
you've got scheduled for this afternoon...

21:01.972 --> 21:05.221
Nothing leaves the plant
without an okay from the IADC.

21:05.471 --> 21:08.886
- Thank you very much, Miss...
- Dewitt. Lucy Dewitt.

21:12.636 --> 21:14.802
Yes, I'm the Lucy Dewitt...

21:14.969 --> 21:18.509
Marshall Henshaw's friend and confidante.

21:19.176 --> 21:23.633
I'm sorry. It's just that probably
every little girl dreams about...

21:23.716 --> 21:26.924
growing up and falling in love
with the richest man in the world.

21:27.007 --> 21:29.507
Well, you went and did it.

21:30.506 --> 21:33.339
Well, dreams have their ups and downs.

21:34.089 --> 21:39.004
Don't worry. I'm not gonna ask you
what Marshall Henshaw looks like.

21:40.212 --> 21:43.128
Although I'm dying to. Thank you.

21:49.959 --> 21:53.083
Come on, Ira. Tell me what he looks like.

21:53.167 --> 21:55.958
A physical description of
Marshall Henshaw...

21:56.042 --> 21:58.291
Was not part of Steve Trevor's request.

21:58.790 --> 22:01.540
Is that your way of telling me
you don't know?

22:01.624 --> 22:04.748
It is my way of telling you
I am not telling.

22:05.080 --> 22:06.497
My, aren't we grouchy?

22:06.580 --> 22:09.121
Sounds like your chess game
took a turn for the worse.

22:09.204 --> 22:10.538
No comment.

22:10.704 --> 22:13.203
Okay, how do we get in touch
with Henshaw?

22:13.329 --> 22:17.411
He has one private phone. Area code: 213.

22:17.869 --> 22:22.076
Number: 555-3037.

22:22.160 --> 22:24.200
And if we have to reach him in person?

22:24.284 --> 22:28.533
29872 North Coast Highway.

22:28.616 --> 22:31.366
You know, it sure would help
if I knew what he looked like.

22:31.448 --> 22:34.739
Do you know what "fat chance " means,
Diana Prince?

22:34.865 --> 22:38.905
All too well. I'm gonna have
to have Steve follow up on this.

22:38.989 --> 22:40.947
But thank you for your help, Ira.

22:41.697 --> 22:44.862
By the way, Steve asked me
to ask you a question.

22:45.362 --> 22:48.319
Something about some woman's name?

22:50.569 --> 22:51.777
Hello?

23:03.149 --> 23:04.440
Here's $3.80.

23:05.732 --> 23:08.107
Would you mind taking an IOU on the tip?

23:08.272 --> 23:10.647
I'm Marshall Henshaw,
and I'll have my secretary-

23:10.730 --> 23:12.647
You're Marshall Henshaw?

23:12.939 --> 23:14.271
- Yeah.
- Mister...

23:14.355 --> 23:18.020
I wouldn't take my own IOUs,
and I'm John D. Rockefeller!

23:28.643 --> 23:32.558
One more hour, Colonel.
That is all that I will allow.

23:32.975 --> 23:35.557
- Dunfield.
- This is Security in the lobby.

23:37.766 --> 23:41.348
There's a man down here
Who claims he's Marshall Henshaw.

23:42.264 --> 23:43.389
Describe him.

23:43.472 --> 23:47.221
About 6 feet tall, slender,
a moustache, gray-blonde hair.

23:48.596 --> 23:49.637
Throw him out.

23:49.721 --> 23:52.720
Prime Minister,
I'm certain we can handle this.

23:52.845 --> 23:56.011
IADC agents are at the
Henshaw factory right now.

23:57.218 --> 23:59.551
And I was under the impression...

23:59.926 --> 24:03.050
that I could trust
the world's most prestigious industrialist.

24:03.134 --> 24:06.550
We're not absolutely sure
that Henshaw International was involved.

24:06.633 --> 24:08.507
He's quite adamant, sir.

24:08.883 --> 24:12.423
The man is obviously deranged.
Throw him out.

24:13.631 --> 24:16.172
I demand to talk to Marshall Henshaw.

24:17.338 --> 24:22.212
Well, as is usually the case,
we don't know where he is, I'm afraid.

24:30.669 --> 24:32.210
All right. Let go of me!

24:34.042 --> 24:37.375
I'm gonna buy this hotel
and I'm gonna fire the whole lot of you!

24:39.291 --> 24:41.957
So that's what money and power
are all about.

24:42.541 --> 24:45.665
I'm trying to think.
I'm trying to figure this out.

24:46.747 --> 24:50.871
Why is Dunfield doing this to me?
He's trying to take over the company.

24:52.038 --> 24:54.412
No, he would've had me killed.

24:56.453 --> 24:57.578
Missy!

24:58.786 --> 25:00.911
He must plan to steal Missy!

25:01.619 --> 25:04.327
Anything you say.
Me, I think I'm gonna be going.

25:04.409 --> 25:08.284
We gotta collect some more bottles and
get to Keystone Hills as fast as we can.

25:08.367 --> 25:10.742
- We?
- I know where we can get some help.

25:10.824 --> 25:12.699
You said "we" again.

25:51.856 --> 25:54.188
My name is Diana Prince,
and I'm with the IADC...

25:54.272 --> 25:57.521
and I'd like to ask you about a shipment
from the Henshaw factory.

26:03.353 --> 26:05.853
Then again, I guess it can wait.

27:14.585 --> 27:15.668
All right.

27:17.001 --> 27:20.333
Who told you to arrange
that little reception for Diana Prince?

27:20.791 --> 27:23.416
By now, I'm sure she's been taken care of.

27:23.957 --> 27:27.831
And you were right not to try to remove
the scrambler from the plant right away.

27:27.914 --> 27:30.539
That's what the IADC
immediately thought had happened.

27:32.955 --> 27:34.454
So you think our worries are over?

27:34.538 --> 27:37.662
By tonight we'll have delivered Missy
to your black-market buyer...

27:37.745 --> 27:39.453
and be well on our way to Switzerland.

27:43.785 --> 27:46.410
Look, I'll be over at the factory
in exactly one hour...

27:46.493 --> 27:49.285
to pick up the trash.

27:49.575 --> 27:50.909
I'll be there, ready to go.

27:51.450 --> 27:54.783
Lucy, I love you.

28:12.320 --> 28:14.985
Marsh! How did you
get past my bodyguard?

28:15.110 --> 28:17.443
Same way I always
got past your bodyguard, Lucy.

28:17.527 --> 28:18.860
Let me in.

28:20.776 --> 28:23.692
I gotta tell you what happened.
This is Barney.

28:24.275 --> 28:26.608
- I owe him some money.
- How you been, Luce?

28:26.691 --> 28:30.149
Listen, I was coming back from signing
the Missy deal and I got jumped.

28:30.357 --> 28:32.398
They took everything, my wallet...

28:32.981 --> 28:36.064
my watch, my keys,
my credit cards, everything.

28:36.314 --> 28:39.979
And Dunfield, of all people, is in on it!

28:45.770 --> 28:46.978
Where are you going?

28:47.061 --> 28:49.894
Chicago, for the weekend.
My mother's sick.

28:51.602 --> 28:55.642
Dunfield's up to something,
like, maybe, stealing Missy.

28:56.434 --> 28:57.850
At least, that's what I figure.

28:57.975 --> 29:01.515
You gotta call Abernathy and Doyle,
tell them to find out what's going on.

29:01.599 --> 29:03.390
I'll get right on it.

29:04.515 --> 29:07.055
I always figured something like this
would happen...

29:07.514 --> 29:09.431
staying out of sight...

29:09.805 --> 29:13.804
surrounding myself with
avaricious executive types...

29:14.637 --> 29:16.637
always wearing disguises.

29:16.886 --> 29:19.386
Nobody believes me
when I tell them who I am.

29:19.469 --> 29:22.427
You and Dunfield are the only two people
in the state of California...

29:22.510 --> 29:23.802
who know what I look like.

29:28.883 --> 29:32.799
Your parents are in Europe on vacation.
You told me that yourself.

29:33.216 --> 29:36.673
They came back early
because Mom is sick.

29:38.215 --> 29:41.005
You and Dunfield?

29:41.880 --> 29:43.505
You're in this together?

29:46.963 --> 29:48.379
Why, Lucy?

29:49.254 --> 29:50.419
Oh, Marsh...

29:51.628 --> 29:54.127
we were taking each other for a ride.

29:54.293 --> 29:58.459
You were the world's richest man to me,
and I was some kind of commodity to you.

29:58.960 --> 30:00.542
That's not true.

30:00.626 --> 30:03.957
Yes, it is. You just never
stopped to think about it.

30:06.540 --> 30:07.832
You'd better leave.

30:07.915 --> 30:09.956
That's the story of this guy's life.

30:10.082 --> 30:12.081
But you can't do this, Lucy.

30:12.206 --> 30:14.663
Yes, I can. Easily.

30:15.288 --> 30:18.746
I put up with our "relationship"
for two years. Didn't I?

30:20.329 --> 30:22.536
But, Dunfield.

30:23.620 --> 30:25.077
Please leave.

30:25.203 --> 30:28.826
All I have to do is press that button
and the guard will come in gun first.

30:28.910 --> 30:30.951
All right. We're leaving.

30:31.035 --> 30:34.408
Come on, Barney.
You're too young to be exposed to this.

30:36.408 --> 30:38.824
We could've had you killed, Marsh.

30:43.448 --> 30:45.864
They're gonna get away with this.

30:46.281 --> 30:50.280
The richest man in the world,
and I can't lift a finger to stop them.

30:51.113 --> 30:52.903
Would these help?

30:54.237 --> 30:55.695
You're a regular delinquent.

30:55.778 --> 30:57.278
I don't like her very much.

30:57.361 --> 31:00.402
These are the keys
to the car I gave her last spring.

31:00.860 --> 31:03.110
Come on, Barney.
We're gonna get to my factory...

31:03.192 --> 31:06.109
and talk to the only other person
in California who knows...

31:06.192 --> 31:07.775
I'm Marshall Henshaw.

31:07.859 --> 31:10.524
Thank heavens he refused to retire at 65.

31:19.397 --> 31:23.105
Mike? There's a man outside with a boy.
I want them followed.

31:23.479 --> 31:25.145
And keep in touch.

31:28.311 --> 31:29.936
The man who pulled the gun on me...

31:30.019 --> 31:33.018
was just doing what a voice
on the phone told him, Steve.

31:33.102 --> 31:36.559
But I'd bet anything that his orders
ultimately came from Lucy Dewitt.

31:36.726 --> 31:39.225
The field office hasn't found
anything at the factory.

31:39.392 --> 31:42.350
We can't pick her up for questioning
unless we have some kind of proof.

31:42.516 --> 31:43.682
How's the Prime Minister?

31:43.766 --> 31:46.556
I've convinced her to let us handle this
for a little longer.

31:46.640 --> 31:48.181
Now, the way I've got it figured...

31:48.264 --> 31:50.430
if the scrambler is in the plant,
we'll find it.

31:50.514 --> 31:53.180
- Ifit's not-
- There's nothing anybody can do.

31:55.222 --> 31:56.304
I'm going out there.

31:56.387 --> 31:58.762
Have you tried to get in touch
with Marshall Henshaw?

31:58.845 --> 32:00.844
Trying is one thing, succeeding is another.

32:01.345 --> 32:04.510
Right. Talk to you later.

32:19.548 --> 32:20.964
Hang on, kid.

32:34.044 --> 32:36.794
- Do you know how to drive?
- I'm learning fast, aren't I?

32:37.169 --> 32:39.376
I thought you told me you had a license.

32:39.543 --> 32:43.126
I never needed one.
Got my first chauffeur when I was 15.

32:44.250 --> 32:45.667
Hang on.

33:33.154 --> 33:34.404
Oh, heck!

33:35.487 --> 33:38.944
You owe whoever owns this
vegetable stand a lot more than $50.

33:39.028 --> 33:40.903
I'll pay.

34:26.099 --> 34:27.349
You guys need some help?

34:27.431 --> 34:29.724
Yes, as a matter of fact,
we could sure use a lift.

34:29.806 --> 34:32.806
- I really don't make a policy of-
- Come on, please.

34:33.556 --> 34:35.054
All right, hop in.

34:35.721 --> 34:37.679
You got a license?

34:44.137 --> 34:47.760
I'm really in a hurry, so why don't
I drop you off at the nearest phone?

34:47.844 --> 34:48.885
Fine.

34:49.635 --> 34:52.051
How are our finances holding up?

34:53.132 --> 34:55.550
You've really fallen onto hard times,
haven't you?

34:55.632 --> 34:57.675
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.666
Wait for me, will you, lady?

35:28.750 --> 35:32.373
Stay in the car and wait for me.
With my luck, the phone'll be out of order.

35:32.457 --> 35:35.706
- Yeah, but-
- Lady, he's not kidding about his luck.

35:54.743 --> 35:56.118
They're with some woman.

35:56.243 --> 35:58.117
- A real looker.
- Describe her.

35:59.200 --> 36:04.116
A brunette, about 5'10",
like I said, a real looker.

36:04.241 --> 36:07.073
Wearing a plaid suit, gray hat,
and red-colored turtleneck?

36:07.157 --> 36:08.323
Yeah.

36:09.322 --> 36:13.238
I should've known we were in trouble
when I didn't hear from anyone at Norfolk.

36:13.405 --> 36:17.571
You've just described the IADC agent
who was in here before perfectly.

36:19.028 --> 36:21.278
It's too late to start making changes.

36:21.361 --> 36:22.777
We've got some work to do, Mike.

36:22.944 --> 36:26.110
What do you mean 15 cents more?
I haven't got 15 cents more.

36:28.235 --> 36:29.609
All right. Hold on.

36:33.150 --> 36:35.358
Don't touch that, I'm using it.

36:40.065 --> 36:41.314
Lady!

36:42.106 --> 36:45.563
Would you come and help me, please,
just for a minute? Come on.

36:56.727 --> 36:57.977
You there?

36:58.727 --> 37:02.184
Well, hold out your hand because
here comes your crummy 15 cents.

37:02.434 --> 37:04.934
I need 15 cents. You got 15 cents, lady?

37:06.350 --> 37:07.433
Sure.

37:15.722 --> 37:18.929
Thank you. Okay.
Now hold on, 'cause here it comes.

37:22.804 --> 37:25.678
Satisfied? Now, connect the call.

37:34.010 --> 37:36.342
What do you mean I have to dial again?

37:36.800 --> 37:39.049
Well, keep trying till it's un-busy.

37:41.049 --> 37:43.382
I better get my 40 cents back!

37:48.131 --> 37:49.922
Line's busy. I gotta call back.

37:50.006 --> 37:52.921
Here's some more change, just in case.

37:53.629 --> 37:55.670
I've really got to be going.

37:57.545 --> 38:00.060
Thanks, lady. I really appreciate your help.

38:00.095 --> 38:02.570
You're welcome.
Are you two gonna be all right?

38:02.627 --> 38:06.376
Just one phone call to an old friend
should solve all our problems.

38:06.459 --> 38:08.542
Looks like your friend left.

38:14.582 --> 38:16.165
Looks like this is for you.

38:31.703 --> 38:33.078
Bad news?

38:34.827 --> 38:36.327
The worst.

38:40.825 --> 38:41.950
What're you doing?

38:42.034 --> 38:44.283
Look, lady,
I don't wanna see that kid get hurt.

38:44.367 --> 38:46.491
And you don't wanna
see him hurt either, do you?

38:46.574 --> 38:48.449
Of course not. But I don't wanna get hurt.

38:48.531 --> 38:50.740
Okay, then you gotta do what I tell you.

38:51.156 --> 38:53.989
- Get out of the car, I gotta borrow it.
- Sure. Anytime.

38:54.073 --> 38:55.280
Move it.

38:56.405 --> 38:57.446
Listen, buddy-

38:57.529 --> 39:00.695
You're not gonna believe this,
but my name is Marshall Henshaw.

39:00.778 --> 39:02.570
You're Marshall Henshaw?

39:02.653 --> 39:04.986
Like I said, I haven't got time
for explanations...

39:05.069 --> 39:06.652
or nitwit telephone operators.

39:06.736 --> 39:08.943
Chances are,
they've taken that kid to my factory.

39:09.027 --> 39:10.276
Okay. Now, listen.

39:10.359 --> 39:14.483
If it's any consolation to you, lady,
I was supposed to use this on you.

39:22.065 --> 39:23.772
Would you wait up?

39:46.559 --> 39:48.141
Marshall Henshaw.

40:49.293 --> 40:51.459
All tucked away, safe and sound.

40:51.625 --> 40:52.750
Good.

40:52.833 --> 40:55.042
That platoon of IADC agents finally left...

40:55.124 --> 40:58.540
but I still think we ought to
take the boy along to the airport.

40:59.457 --> 41:01.248
Yeah, he might come in handy.

41:01.457 --> 41:04.122
Besides, we can't very well
leave him here, can we?

41:04.456 --> 41:06.580
Why don't you try asking me?

41:11.704 --> 41:13.036
Let's go.

41:29.657 --> 41:30.782
Watch out!

41:43.945 --> 41:45.112
I'll pay.

41:46.820 --> 41:49.610
- I don't believe you.
- Come on, you gotta help me.

42:03.232 --> 42:05.856
You weren't really planning on leaving,
were you?

42:11.772 --> 42:13.355
I didn't think so.

42:22.685 --> 42:24.769
Keller! Morfett!

43:44.914 --> 43:47.081
Let's split. Meet at the car! Come on!

43:49.497 --> 43:50.954
- Where are they?
- There.

43:51.038 --> 43:53.870
Don't let them hurt the boy, please.
I'll go after her.

43:59.494 --> 44:01.076
Let me go, Marsh.

44:01.160 --> 44:04.576
Now that we're finally together again?
Not on your life.

44:13.740 --> 44:15.448
Looking for these?

44:21.405 --> 44:24.612
- Is this man bothering you?
- It's nothing I couldn't handle.

44:32.652 --> 44:35.277
There's no damage,
it's ready to be shipped.

44:35.484 --> 44:38.734
And I know exactly who
I wanna have do the shipping.

44:40.109 --> 44:43.566
Where is she? Wonder Woman was here
just a minute ago.

44:43.649 --> 44:46.982
She usually slips away like that,
I guess she doesn't like goodbyes.

44:47.065 --> 44:50.897
But don't worry, Missy will be
on her way to Europe within two hours...

44:50.981 --> 44:52.397
that I promise.

44:53.063 --> 44:57.521
I suppose if someone had to leave me
stranded and wreck my rented car...

44:57.604 --> 45:00.145
at least it was the richest man
in the world.

45:01.728 --> 45:04.394
I'm sorry about that. It was an emergency.

45:04.644 --> 45:05.893
I understand.

45:05.977 --> 45:09.518
And about the car, my lawyers are
taking care of everything right now.

45:09.892 --> 45:11.433
I'm sure they are.

45:15.391 --> 45:18.890
- Which reminds me...
- Yeah, that $50 I owe you.

45:19.140 --> 45:22.889
I've been thinking about that and I'd like
to pay you back in installments.

45:22.972 --> 45:25.055
Like a weekly allowance.

45:25.888 --> 45:27.721
- No kidding?
- No kidding.

45:28.055 --> 45:31.720
Of course, it'd mean you'd have to give up
that palace of yours in the woods.

45:31.803 --> 45:33.844
- No kidding.
- No kidding.

45:40.635 --> 45:42.051
So, in other words...

45:42.134 --> 45:45.717
if you'd given me a description
of Marshall Henshaw when I asked for it...

45:45.800 --> 45:47.716
begged you for it, in fact...

45:47.799 --> 45:50.798
you would have saved everyone
a lot of trouble.

45:50.882 --> 45:54.756
How fortunate that Wonder Woman
happened upon the situation.

45:56.964 --> 45:59.880
Yes. But that's no excuse
for your behavior, Ira.

46:00.047 --> 46:03.045
When people ask you for information
you should give it to them.

46:03.129 --> 46:05.503
Shall I make all my data
in my memory banks...

46:05.587 --> 46:09.210
including that concerning you,
available to everyone, Diana Prince?

46:09.294 --> 46:10.502
Cute.

46:11.877 --> 46:13.668
So, how is your chess game coming?

46:13.751 --> 46:17.834
The I.R.A. C. computer does not
engage in activities that are-

46:17.916 --> 46:20.875
Which computer gives you
the most competition?

46:20.958 --> 46:24.540
The central computer at the university.
It cheats.

46:25.872 --> 46:29.289
Just got a telegram. Says, "Missy arrived
in Europe all safe and sound. "

46:29.372 --> 46:31.163
Great. Let's see here.

46:31.663 --> 46:35.912
Now, Ira, about that woman whose
voice was on the tape...

46:36.453 --> 46:37.495
Hello.

46:37.578 --> 46:41.119
The I.R.A.C. computer is unable
to complete your call as dialed.

46:41.202 --> 46:43.077
That one, Steve Trevor?

46:43.202 --> 46:44.576
Yeah, that's the one.

46:44.827 --> 46:46.326
Or this one?

46:46.826 --> 46:50.783
Hello. The I.R.A.C. computer is unable
to complete your call as dialed.

46:50.866 --> 46:54.032
I can electronically simulate
anyone you wish.

46:54.865 --> 46:56.323
That's a rotten trick!

46:56.698 --> 46:58.114
I'm gonna get him for that.

47:45.061 --> 47:46.394
