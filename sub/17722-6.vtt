WEBVTT

00:01.250 --> 00:02.542
Hey, I was thinking tonight,
we should um...

00:02.583 --> 00:05.250
We should go see that new
Sandra Bullock movie.

00:05.291 --> 00:07.125
Have you seen my
cell phone?

00:07.166 --> 00:08.625
Sandra Bullock's new
movie is called,

00:08.667 --> 00:10.125
"have you seen
my cell phone?"

00:10.166 --> 00:11.166
(chuckles)

00:11.917 --> 00:13.834
mm... Minty.

00:13.875 --> 00:15.333
And no, I'm actually
asking you.

00:15.375 --> 00:16.333
Have you seen it?

00:16.375 --> 00:18.041
Mm... Oh.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.041
Ah-ha-ha, good
morning, Erica.

00:21.083 --> 00:21.750
Thank you.

00:21.792 --> 00:22.834
You're welcome.

00:22.875 --> 00:24.500
Hey, can I say a "maybe"
to the movie?

00:24.542 --> 00:26.166
Sure, yeah.

00:26.208 --> 00:27.083
(sighs)

00:27.125 --> 00:28.208
Have a great day.

00:28.250 --> 00:29.625
You too, bye.

00:32.667 --> 00:34.166
(humming happily)

00:40.959 --> 00:42.959
Good.

00:43.959 --> 00:45.208
(humming happily)

00:46.709 --> 00:48.500
(hurried breaths)

00:48.542 --> 00:51.083
(paper rustles,
Erica groans)

00:51.125 --> 00:53.041
Key card! I forgot
that, too.

00:53.083 --> 00:55.542
Oh, hey, you know, I
don't think it's there.

00:55.583 --> 00:58.417
Um... I think...
It's right here.

00:59.166 --> 00:59.959
(sings happily)

01:00.000 --> 01:00.959
Thank you.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.709
I will let you
get back to...

01:02.750 --> 01:04.250
Summer school homework?

01:04.291 --> 01:06.750
Yep, just me and "Jane Eyre"
rocking it victorian-lit style.

01:06.792 --> 01:08.041
Erica: ever get
that feeling

01:08.083 --> 01:09.542
that you've stumbled
upon a secret?

01:09.583 --> 01:12.041
You know, "Jane Eyre," it's
one of my favourite novels,

01:12.083 --> 01:14.041
if you need help
with a lesson plan.

01:14.083 --> 01:15.333
Oh, no, really,
I'm fine.

01:15.375 --> 01:17.333
But Julianne's gonna be
foaming at the mouth

01:17.375 --> 01:18.333
if you're late,
so...

01:18.375 --> 01:19.375
Right.

01:21.041 --> 01:22.917
They say that
what you don't know

01:22.959 --> 01:24.166
can't hurt you,

01:24.208 --> 01:26.834
but is that really true?

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Okay...

01:31.083 --> 01:31.625
Julianne?

01:31.667 --> 01:32.208
Erica.

01:32.250 --> 01:33.417
Hi! Good morning.

01:33.458 --> 01:35.417
I was just hoping to set up
a meeting with you

01:35.458 --> 01:38.208
because I think that I have
found us the perfect author

01:38.250 --> 01:39.208
for the sex scoop.

01:39.250 --> 01:40.291
Ooh! Faboo.

01:40.333 --> 01:42.291
Have Meeri set up
a lunch.

01:42.333 --> 01:44.959
Uh, she's not at her desk.

01:45.041 --> 01:47.333
Wow, those are...
Those are beautiful.

01:47.375 --> 01:49.917
Well, Friedy says in
"the secret of now":

01:49.959 --> 01:52.125
"always have your exterior

01:52.166 --> 01:54.542
match your interior."

01:54.583 --> 01:55.250
Um...

01:55.291 --> 01:56.458
(clears throat)

01:56.500 --> 01:58.417
Can you keep a secret?

01:58.458 --> 01:59.458
Um...

02:01.208 --> 02:02.250
I...

02:02.291 --> 02:04.166
I mean, I like to
think that I can.

02:04.208 --> 02:06.250
So, today is
Friedy's birthday,

02:06.291 --> 02:07.166
oh!

02:07.208 --> 02:09.542
And I'm giving him...

02:10.542 --> 02:11.542
(keys jingle)

02:12.542 --> 02:14.250
the key to my place.

02:14.291 --> 02:15.375
Oh.

02:15.417 --> 02:17.125
What?

02:17.166 --> 02:18.625
What? It's too much,
too soon?

02:18.667 --> 02:20.625
No. No-no-no,
it's great.

02:20.667 --> 02:21.959
(keys rattle in box)

02:22.000 --> 02:22.750
So...

02:22.792 --> 02:24.083
(clears throat)

02:24.125 --> 02:25.834
this-this writer,
does she have a name?

02:25.875 --> 02:28.125
Does she have a cv?
Can I read it?

02:28.166 --> 02:30.625
Erica: her name's Elexus Earner
and since Meeri's not here,

02:30.667 --> 02:33.709
I'm gonna go photocopy
her cv for you myself.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.250
And, um, Julianne,
I'm just...

02:39.250 --> 02:41.333
I'm really happy for
you.

02:42.333 --> 02:42.917
Thanks.

02:44.458 --> 02:47.041
Erica: Secrets. They
keep things interesting.

02:47.083 --> 02:49.375
Some are the kind
we're dying to find out;

02:49.417 --> 02:52.166
Others are secrets
we're straining to keep;

02:52.208 --> 02:53.250
and still others...

02:53.291 --> 02:54.291
Oh!

02:54.333 --> 02:55.417
Whoa! Oh!

02:57.125 --> 02:58.375
Oh my God! I...

02:58.417 --> 02:59.917
I was just gonna, um...

02:59.959 --> 03:02.250
The photocopy and...
Excuse me, I...

03:02.291 --> 03:03.875
(stammering awkwardly)

03:05.208 --> 03:06.375
Excuse me, sorry.

03:08.166 --> 03:10.709
...Are secrets we wish
we didn't know.

Julianne: Never judge
a book by its cover;

03:53.834 --> 03:56.417
judge it by its back cover.

03:57.417 --> 03:59.542
We've got lots of
great options.

03:59.583 --> 04:01.542
See, the author
photo is key.

04:01.583 --> 04:05.125
It lets the audience connect
with the voice of the book.

04:05.166 --> 04:05.792
Oh, sorry.

04:05.834 --> 04:06.625
No, it's all yours.

04:06.667 --> 04:07.709
No, it's fine.

04:07.750 --> 04:08.959
Meeri, have the muffin
already. God.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.875
But, Julianne, you went
for that muffin first.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.125
Okay, chicken, I
don't care.

04:12.166 --> 04:14.625
Now, we have a bunch of photos
to choose from.

04:14.667 --> 04:17.125
I just think that you
had your hand on it.

04:17.166 --> 04:19.667
We all know that you
had your hand on it.

04:19.709 --> 04:21.000
It's yours.

04:21.041 --> 04:22.458
Okay, Erica, there's no
need to be so "dramatic."

04:22.500 --> 04:23.959
It's just a muffin.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.166
Erica, it's not the first
or the last blueberry muffin...

04:26.208 --> 04:26.959
In the world.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.208
Okay, easy-peasy solution,

04:28.250 --> 04:30.542
let's share, okay?

04:30.583 --> 04:34.083
Okay. Now,
as I was saying,

04:34.125 --> 04:38.000
when people buy a book,
they're also...

04:38.041 --> 04:39.750
Buying into the author.

04:39.792 --> 04:41.250
That is where trust
comes in...

04:41.291 --> 04:43.542
I really don't think
they should share the muffin.

04:43.583 --> 04:45.333
Great! Because, you know,
I'm not interested

04:45.375 --> 04:46.583
in the muffin
anymore anyway.

04:46.625 --> 04:47.750
Friedken:
No? Why not?

04:47.792 --> 04:50.083
Why deny yourself the
muffin, Meeri?

04:51.083 --> 04:52.500
Live in the now.

04:52.542 --> 04:55.709
Erica: or... Meeri, unlock the
mystery of tomorrow.

04:55.750 --> 04:58.041
Will that muffin
really make you happy?

04:58.083 --> 05:00.417
Wouldn't you be happier
with your own muffin?

05:00.458 --> 05:03.000
Hell, I've been known to
enjoy multiple muffins,

05:03.041 --> 05:04.875
two or three
times a day.

05:04.917 --> 05:06.291
Four on the weekend.

05:06.333 --> 05:09.125
I'm "stoked" that the muffins
are such a hot topic,

05:09.166 --> 05:12.667
but can we try and focus,
people, please.

05:12.709 --> 05:13.875
Now...

05:13.917 --> 05:15.875
Oh. My. God!

05:15.917 --> 05:17.250
This is juicier

05:17.291 --> 05:18.834
than the time Dory accidentally
forwarded monkey porn

05:18.875 --> 05:20.792
to everyone in fiction.

05:20.834 --> 05:23.250
Okay,
just to be clear,

05:23.291 --> 05:26.917
Meeri is eating
Friedken's muffin, right?

05:26.959 --> 05:27.542
Brent.

05:27.583 --> 05:28.542
Did you see it?

05:28.583 --> 05:30.583
Yes! And I really
wish I hadn't.

05:30.625 --> 05:31.625
Oh.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.458
Erica, please.

05:35.500 --> 05:37.500
Um... Brent,

05:37.542 --> 05:38.750
Could I talk to Erica?

05:38.792 --> 05:39.792
Sure.

05:42.208 --> 05:43.625
(sighs)

05:43.667 --> 05:44.750
Meeri, he knows.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.875
Please, promise me that
you won't tell Julianne.

05:48.917 --> 05:50.500
It was a one
time thing.

05:50.542 --> 05:52.625
A huge lapse
in judgment.

05:52.667 --> 05:53.875
That's putting it mildly.

05:53.917 --> 05:55.792
Meeri: Look,
I've just...

05:55.834 --> 05:57.875
I've wanted to work
in publishing forever

05:57.917 --> 06:00.583
and he...Listens to me.

06:00.625 --> 06:03.375
To what I have to say,
to my ideas.

06:03.417 --> 06:05.166
With Julianne,
it's just...

06:05.208 --> 06:06.917
It's all just
making lattes,

06:06.959 --> 06:08.625
or laminating
personal photos,

06:08.667 --> 06:11.375
which I have to go and do
on my lunch break

06:11.417 --> 06:12.375
on my own time.

06:12.417 --> 06:13.875
Another worthy business
expense.

06:13.917 --> 06:15.625
You guys remember
what it was like

06:15.667 --> 06:18.000
being Julianne's assistant.

06:18.041 --> 06:19.917
Uh, yes, I remember
perfectly well.

06:19.959 --> 06:22.083
Julianne, she promotes
people based on merit.

06:22.125 --> 06:24.917
So, if you expect me
to feel sorry for you, Meeri?

06:24.959 --> 06:26.417
I don't.

06:26.458 --> 06:29.083
Hello? That latte isn't
gonna make itself.

06:32.291 --> 06:34.959
Erica, please,
I'm begging you.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.250
I cannot lose this job.

06:43.041 --> 06:45.250
(Phones ringing)

06:46.333 --> 06:47.291
(phone beeps)

06:47.333 --> 06:49.417
(inhales and exhales deeply)

06:50.417 --> 06:51.625
(phone chimes)

06:59.875 --> 07:01.500
I read your
concept outline,

07:01.542 --> 07:04.333
and I gotta say,
I'm impressed.

07:04.375 --> 07:05.959
Good. Just making
origami fresh.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.083
Which is exactly why
I assigned it to you.

07:09.125 --> 07:12.709
Takes skill to make an ancient
japanese art form sexy.

07:12.750 --> 07:13.709
I'm trying.

07:13.750 --> 07:15.000
And you're succeeding.

07:15.041 --> 07:16.542
You're doing great
work, truly.

07:16.583 --> 07:19.625
Don't think
it's going unnoticed.

07:19.667 --> 07:21.041
Thank you, Julianne.

07:21.083 --> 07:23.125
I appreciate it.

07:25.375 --> 07:26.458
Galvin: Brent.

07:26.500 --> 07:27.291
Mr. Galvin.

07:27.333 --> 07:29.625
I'm glad I ran
into you.

07:29.667 --> 07:33.166
How are things in
the non-fiction department?

07:33.208 --> 07:35.208
Any more concerns?

07:36.583 --> 07:38.000
No, sir.

07:38.041 --> 07:40.125
No, nothing at all.

07:45.750 --> 07:47.709
(vehicle rumbles past)

07:47.750 --> 07:50.500
(chatting and laughing)

07:51.333 --> 07:52.333
Kai!

07:53.709 --> 07:54.583
Hey.

07:54.625 --> 07:56.041
Hey.

07:56.083 --> 07:58.458
Um, it's good...
It's good to see you.

07:58.500 --> 08:01.000
I mean, on the street,
just away from goblins and...

08:01.041 --> 08:02.750
Yeah, well, they
occasionally let me out.

08:02.792 --> 08:04.125
(laughs)

08:04.166 --> 08:05.125
I'll see you later.

08:05.166 --> 08:06.417
Look, hey, Kai, wait.

08:06.458 --> 08:07.333
What?

08:07.375 --> 08:08.333
I just...

08:08.375 --> 08:09.583
You can't be friends
with me anymore.

08:09.625 --> 08:11.041
I know, you told me.

08:11.083 --> 08:13.625
We can only talk about coffee
or therapy, and that's fine.

08:13.667 --> 08:15.125
No, it's not fine.
It's just...

08:15.166 --> 08:17.208
I mean, look, it's...
It's so complicated.

08:17.250 --> 08:18.333
Complicated...

08:18.375 --> 08:20.208
Like how you know the name
of my therapist

08:20.250 --> 08:21.709
even though
I didn't tell you?

08:21.750 --> 08:23.959
All right, listen,
you know where to find me

08:24.000 --> 08:26.083
if you ever wanna stop
with the bullshit.

08:32.375 --> 08:34.291
Julianne: Attention!

08:34.333 --> 08:36.625
Attention, River Rockians!

08:36.667 --> 08:38.500
So, you're probably
all wondering

08:38.542 --> 08:40.500
why I have summoned
you all here today?

08:40.542 --> 08:42.792
Right in the middle
of the day like this...

08:42.834 --> 08:44.083
What's going on?

08:44.125 --> 08:46.542
Julianne called an all-staff.

08:46.583 --> 08:48.583
Julianne: I have a very
special announcement.

08:48.625 --> 08:53.291
Today, one of River Rock's
most accomplished authors

08:53.333 --> 08:56.000
is celebrating
the big four-five.

08:57.792 --> 08:59.375
Hoo-hoo!
Lookie, lookie.

08:59.417 --> 09:00.542
(light snickering)

09:00.583 --> 09:02.333
Every now and then,

09:02.375 --> 09:03.834
if you're lucky,

09:03.875 --> 09:07.083
you have the privilege
of finding a writer

09:07.125 --> 09:09.208
who really speaks to you.

09:10.417 --> 09:15.250
Friedy, with you, I have found
not only a great associate,

09:15.291 --> 09:15.875
but also

09:15.917 --> 09:16.500
(sighing)

09:16.542 --> 09:18.041
A great friend.

09:18.083 --> 09:19.792
I'm not gonna lie,

09:19.834 --> 09:21.125
your work sells,

09:21.166 --> 09:23.417
and, well, we love that
here at River Rock,

09:23.458 --> 09:27.333
but your wisdom has
also opened my eyes

09:27.375 --> 09:29.166
to a whole new way
of thinking.

09:29.208 --> 09:31.166
Brent, you didn't tell
anyone else, did you?

09:31.208 --> 09:33.291
Julianne: ...Changed my
perspective in so many ways...

09:33.333 --> 09:34.291
Brent!

09:34.333 --> 09:35.583
Ah, look at me
getting emotional.

09:35.625 --> 09:37.000
(chuckles)

09:37.041 --> 09:40.291
all of you, it is time to sing
for your dessert.

09:40.333 --> 09:41.583
Ready, chickens?

09:41.625 --> 09:45.250
On the count of three:
one, two, three!

09:45.291 --> 09:48.291
♪ For he's a jolly
good fellow ♪

09:48.333 --> 09:50.917
♪ For he's a jolly
good fellow... ♪

09:50.959 --> 09:51.959
I can't.

09:53.166 --> 09:55.417
Easy there, tigress.

09:55.458 --> 09:57.250
♪ Which nobody can deny! ♪

09:58.375 --> 09:59.166
Cheers, darling.

09:59.208 --> 10:00.583
Brent, let go of me.

10:00.625 --> 10:02.667
Brent: trust me, you'll thank
me in the morning.

10:02.709 --> 10:03.917
What are you doing?

10:03.959 --> 10:05.375
Saving you from yourself.

10:05.417 --> 10:07.000
Take it from me,

10:07.041 --> 10:09.125
do your job and mind
your own business.

10:09.166 --> 10:11.125
And just stand by
and let this happen?

10:11.166 --> 10:12.625
I can't just not
say anything.

10:12.667 --> 10:15.375
Look, she is your boss,
not your friend.

10:15.417 --> 10:16.917
I learned that
the hard way,

10:16.959 --> 10:19.083
and she will shoot
the messenger.

10:19.125 --> 10:20.917
Your brutal honesty
will just hurt Julianne,

10:20.959 --> 10:23.667
ruin Meeri and make
Friedken your enemy.

10:23.709 --> 10:26.333
What's the point? Does it
affect the sex book?

10:26.375 --> 10:27.375
No, but...

10:27.417 --> 10:29.417
So, put it out
of your mind.

10:29.458 --> 10:33.041
This is what Julianne gets for
mixing business with pleasure.

10:33.083 --> 10:34.125
(frustrated sigh)

10:34.166 --> 10:36.417
Maybe you're right.

10:36.458 --> 10:38.208
And maybe you're welcome.

10:41.083 --> 10:42.041
(muted chatter of staff)

10:42.083 --> 10:43.083
Ugh...

10:49.375 --> 10:51.709
Dr. Tom: oh my
God, poor Angie.

10:51.750 --> 10:53.959
Apparently, Brad is
reconnecting with Jen.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.709
Okay, I know what
you're gonna say.

10:55.750 --> 10:57.375
That honesty
is the best policy.

10:57.417 --> 11:00.709
Dr. Tom: it's not the best way
for her to find out the truth.

11:00.750 --> 11:02.959
You know, publicly,
embarrassingly.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.500
I know, but there
really is,

11:04.542 --> 11:06.959
there's no best way
to find out and...

11:07.000 --> 11:08.500
You know what?
Brent is right,

11:08.542 --> 11:10.500
it is none of
my business.

11:11.208 --> 11:14.500
Tell me about
"the fashion show."

11:15.208 --> 11:16.166
Okay, you know what?

11:16.208 --> 11:17.959
I know where you're
going with that,

11:18.000 --> 11:19.709
and what's happening
to Julianne out there?

11:19.750 --> 11:21.166
Totally different.

11:21.917 --> 11:23.542
Yeah.

11:23.583 --> 11:25.417
Okay.

11:25.458 --> 11:27.166
It was my final year.

11:27.208 --> 11:29.625
And there was this girl
in my class...

11:29.667 --> 11:30.875
Fiona.

11:30.917 --> 11:32.125
Classic overachiever.

11:32.166 --> 11:34.750
I mean, annoying,
but totally harmless.

11:34.792 --> 11:38.250
And we'd known her for years,
but barely noticed her.

11:38.291 --> 11:40.834
But that year,
for some reason,

11:40.875 --> 11:44.500
jenny decided to make her life
a living hell.

11:44.542 --> 11:46.834
(muted laughter of students)

11:46.875 --> 11:49.083
and I still don't quite
know to this day

11:49.125 --> 11:50.625
why she hated
her so much,

11:50.667 --> 11:52.208
but every chance
she got,

11:52.250 --> 11:54.583
she went after her
like a serial killer.

11:54.625 --> 11:56.041
(muted laughter)

11:57.375 --> 11:59.125
Sounds ruthless.

11:59.166 --> 12:00.417
It was.

12:00.458 --> 12:02.750
And it all came to a head
at the fashion show.

12:02.792 --> 12:06.875
See, Jenny, she had this agenda
which she told us about.

12:06.917 --> 12:08.625
She was organizing the event

12:08.667 --> 12:10.375
so she had access
to everything,

12:10.417 --> 12:12.083
including...

12:12.125 --> 12:14.458
Fiona's can of
hair mousse.

12:15.458 --> 12:17.417
(muted beat of
dance music)

12:17.458 --> 12:19.667
Erica: it was awful, I mean,
the hair removal,

12:19.709 --> 12:22.417
it took a while
for it to work itself in,

12:22.458 --> 12:24.542
but once it finally did,

12:24.583 --> 12:28.083
it was so unbelievably
humiliating.

12:31.125 --> 12:34.208
Fiona never came back
to school and...

12:34.250 --> 12:36.458
She had a nervous
breakdown.

12:36.500 --> 12:38.750
And I didn't do anything
to stop it.

12:38.792 --> 12:41.709
And you think you could've
prevented it?

12:41.750 --> 12:44.583
Of course I could've.
I could've said something.

12:44.625 --> 12:48.041
But I just, you know,
I just chose not to because...

12:48.083 --> 12:52.375
I felt at the time that
it wasn't any of my business.

12:52.417 --> 12:53.417
Well.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.250
(inhales deeply)

12:57.291 --> 12:58.333
What're you doing?

12:58.375 --> 13:00.083
Dr. Tom: just following
your lead.

13:00.125 --> 13:02.834
You know, it wasn't you
in the copy room with Friedken.

13:02.875 --> 13:04.542
It wasn't you bullying
Fiona, so...

13:04.583 --> 13:05.542
Let's just move on.

13:05.583 --> 13:07.208
No, wait, wait.

13:07.250 --> 13:08.750
It's totally different.

13:08.792 --> 13:11.500
I happened to find out about
Julianne's situation,

13:11.542 --> 13:14.750
but with Jenny, I was...
I mean, I was in on the secret.

13:14.792 --> 13:17.208
I was a part of it.
Just...

13:17.250 --> 13:19.709
Please, what
happened to Fiona,

13:19.750 --> 13:22.250
it is still very
much a regret.

13:27.542 --> 13:28.625
Ahhh!

13:28.667 --> 13:29.667
Ungh!

13:31.542 --> 13:37.250
(panting)

13:38.208 --> 13:39.542
whoops!

13:39.583 --> 13:41.750
Judith: Oh. Impressive.

13:41.792 --> 13:42.917
Thanks, Jude.

13:42.959 --> 13:44.750
If you can't walk down
a hallway, Erica,

13:44.792 --> 13:46.750
how're you supposed
to walk down the catwalk?

13:46.792 --> 13:48.083
Hey, Fiona, hey.

13:48.125 --> 13:49.500
Hey, you ready for tonight?

13:49.542 --> 13:51.792
Ready to, like,
strike a pose?

13:51.834 --> 13:53.125
Uh, sure.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.083
Jenny: Fiona's our very
own Linda Evangelista.

13:55.125 --> 13:57.250
If Linda Evangelista
looked like carrot top

13:57.291 --> 13:58.834
and was fat.

13:58.875 --> 13:59.625
Jenny!

13:59.667 --> 14:00.750
(bell ringing)

14:00.792 --> 14:02.542
There's still time
to quit, Fiona.

14:02.583 --> 14:04.667
Really, I won't
be upset.

14:05.542 --> 14:06.667
Jenny? Jenny!

14:06.709 --> 14:07.917
Was that really necessary?

14:07.959 --> 14:10.083
Letting Fiona take part
in the fashion show?

14:10.125 --> 14:12.083
No, but our stupid principal
thinks it is.

14:12.125 --> 14:14.250
No, I mean being
so awful to her.

14:14.291 --> 14:15.458
(dismissive laugh)

14:15.500 --> 14:18.166
(low hum of chatter)

14:19.792 --> 14:22.000
Oh, I wanna
sex you up.

14:22.041 --> 14:24.750
Zach? How you doing?

14:24.792 --> 14:26.208
You know, tight.

14:26.250 --> 14:28.458
Tight? Well,
you're still young.

14:28.500 --> 14:29.834
Trust me,
that won't last.

14:30.834 --> 14:33.834
Good morning, class.

14:33.875 --> 14:35.000
Zach.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.500
How about you
and your backbone

14:36.542 --> 14:39.125
slide back on over
to your seat?

14:39.166 --> 14:40.417
Word, Mr. C.

14:40.458 --> 14:41.709
Mr. Callaghan:
all right, guys.

14:41.750 --> 14:42.875
Pop quiz!

14:42.917 --> 14:43.834
(groaning)

14:43.875 --> 14:45.583
All right, quit
your whining,

14:45.625 --> 14:47.458
I'll start with a gift.

14:47.500 --> 14:50.542
The chemical symbol
for silver.

14:50.583 --> 14:51.959
Survey says?

14:53.333 --> 14:54.333
Erica?

14:55.750 --> 14:56.834
Uh, what? Me?

14:56.875 --> 14:58.834
Yes, you, really.
Silver.

14:59.834 --> 15:03.417
And I'm not talking David Silver
from Beverly Hills 90210.

15:03.458 --> 15:04.917
(laughing)

15:05.917 --> 15:07.250
that's...

15:10.709 --> 15:13.792
Really? Erica, I'm
surprised.

15:13.834 --> 15:15.458
Anyone else?

15:16.667 --> 15:18.000
Ag.

15:18.041 --> 15:19.667
Mr. Callaghan: Ag, correct.
Thank you, Fiona.

15:19.709 --> 15:20.917
All right, question
number two,

15:20.959 --> 15:22.375
a more difficult one.

15:22.417 --> 15:23.834
What is a flame test?

15:25.291 --> 15:26.750
Jenny?

15:26.792 --> 15:28.500
Why don't you give it
a whirl.

15:28.542 --> 15:29.792
Um...

15:29.834 --> 15:31.000
Okay, um, the...

15:32.291 --> 15:34.917
The test that makes
the smoke change colours?

15:34.959 --> 15:36.875
Almost.
Care to expand?

15:38.542 --> 15:40.041
Technically, Jenny's
answer isn't wrong,

15:40.083 --> 15:41.166
it's just insufficient.

15:41.208 --> 15:42.667
A flame test is actually
a procedure

15:42.709 --> 15:44.917
used to detect the presence
of certain metal ions,

15:44.959 --> 15:46.000
based on each element's

15:46.041 --> 15:47.834
characteristic emission
spectrum.

15:47.875 --> 15:49.417
Very impressive,
Fiona.

15:50.417 --> 15:51.917
Maybe you should
quit chemistry.

15:52.834 --> 15:54.792
Mr. Callaghan: Now, who
remembers what metal results

15:54.834 --> 15:57.083
in a bluish-green
coloured flame?

15:57.125 --> 15:59.041
I hate Fiona Watt.

15:59.083 --> 16:00.375
Erica: I don't
see why?

16:00.417 --> 16:02.542
So, she's better than you
at chemistry, who cares?

16:02.583 --> 16:04.041
Judith: why are you
defending Fiona?

16:04.083 --> 16:04.834
She's a loser.

16:04.875 --> 16:06.083
Yes, Erica,
why are you?

16:06.125 --> 16:07.250
Look, I'm not.

16:07.291 --> 16:09.125
I just think that
you should ignore her.

16:09.166 --> 16:10.375
I mean, she's totally
harmless.

16:10.417 --> 16:11.166
Hey, hey!

16:11.208 --> 16:12.792
Hey, you got it?

16:12.834 --> 16:13.834
Yeah.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.792
Judith: Awesome!

16:17.792 --> 16:20.333
This is gonna be epic.

16:20.375 --> 16:21.834
Erica, what...
What...?

16:21.875 --> 16:23.583
Erica, what the hell
are you doing?!

16:23.625 --> 16:26.041
I am stopping
this now.

16:26.083 --> 16:27.417
Jenny: What?

16:27.458 --> 16:29.917
No, there will be
no hair removal,

16:29.959 --> 16:31.917
there will be no
third degree scalp burns,

16:31.959 --> 16:34.166
there will be no Fiona having
a nervous breakdown

16:34.208 --> 16:37.583
and switching schools
just because she bugs you.

16:37.625 --> 16:39.667
Girlfriend needs
to chill out.

16:39.709 --> 16:40.875
No, you do.

16:40.917 --> 16:42.959
I mean, all of
you guys do.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.583
Yes, fiona is socially
awkward and weird

16:45.625 --> 16:47.834
and, yes, she likes
her fantasy books,

16:47.875 --> 16:51.041
but... You guys, whatever,
she's still a human being.

16:51.083 --> 16:52.166
No, Erica,

16:52.208 --> 16:53.834
she's a stuck-up,
prissy little bitch

16:53.875 --> 16:55.333
who thinks she's
the smartest thing

16:55.375 --> 16:57.041
in the world.

17:00.125 --> 17:01.125
Hey, Jenny,

17:02.417 --> 17:05.125
if she has done or said
anything to hurt you...

17:05.166 --> 17:06.583
Hurt me?

17:06.625 --> 17:08.709
Like she could.

17:08.750 --> 17:09.875
Okay, well...

17:09.917 --> 17:11.959
I mean, let me go
talk to her.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.709
There's gotta be a better way
to solve all this, right?

17:14.750 --> 17:15.750
Let's go.

17:19.500 --> 17:20.500
Hey, Fiona.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.625
That's a great book
you're reading.

17:26.625 --> 17:28.041
You've read it?

17:28.083 --> 17:30.291
Erica: Yeah, all three, and
I've seen the movies, too.

17:30.333 --> 17:34.250
You mean the 1978 animated
film directed by Ralph Bakshi?

17:34.291 --> 17:36.000
Yes.

17:36.041 --> 17:38.041
Um...

17:38.083 --> 17:39.417
Listen.

17:39.458 --> 17:40.875
Fiona, i, um...

17:40.917 --> 17:43.166
I need you to do something
for me, okay?

17:43.208 --> 17:45.709
Can you back
off Jenny?

17:47.375 --> 17:49.333
Or maybe Jenny could
back off of me.

17:49.375 --> 17:50.834
Yeah, she could,
but I'm just...

17:50.875 --> 17:52.875
I'm just talking about
in class, you know?

17:52.917 --> 17:54.625
If you could lay
off her and...

17:54.667 --> 17:56.667
Just, you know, stop
making her feel stupid.

17:56.709 --> 17:59.458
Did you ever think that
maybe she just is stupid?

17:59.500 --> 18:01.542
No, actually,
she's not.

18:01.583 --> 18:04.041
And... I mean I know
that she's hard on you,

really help yourself

if you stop pushing
her buttons.

Hey.

I'm sorry if I've
been harsh.

anything by it.

It's okay,
I'm sorry too.

her parents

what happened...

Yeah, I really wish that
you were there to see it.

21:29.041 --> 21:30.417

I loosened her up.

completely humiliated,

21:36.667 --> 21:38.750

because of you.

Oh no, you mean she might not
make the fashion show?

Why are you enjoying this?

21:44.083 --> 21:45.083

friends with Fiona

25:50.917 --> 25:53.250
Today we're going to be
exploring the acid test.

25:53.291 --> 25:57.083
It's a test that detects acids
and bases in common materials.

25:57.125 --> 25:58.291
Now, keep in mind,

25:58.333 --> 26:00.291
hydrochloric acid
is highly corrosive,

26:00.333 --> 26:01.583
so, get your gloves on

26:01.625 --> 26:04.709
before handling
any of the solutions.

26:04.750 --> 26:07.875
Jenny, thank you
for joining us.

26:07.917 --> 26:09.125
Oh, gee.
Sorry, mr. C.

26:09.166 --> 26:10.875
It's just I was
up all night

26:10.917 --> 26:12.125
dealing with my
asshole boyfriend

26:12.166 --> 26:13.166
who dumped me.

26:17.583 --> 26:18.667
Jenny.

26:18.709 --> 26:20.083
Mr. Callaghan:
back to our lesson.

26:20.125 --> 26:21.917
One of the inherent properties
of acids and bases

26:21.959 --> 26:24.166
is that they change the
colours of certain dyes.

26:24.208 --> 26:25.333
Now, in a moment,

26:25.375 --> 26:27.417
I would like you
to pour a small amount

26:27.458 --> 26:29.166
of the hydrochloric acid
into each flask.

26:29.208 --> 26:31.166
Mr. Callaghan said that
you should use gloves.

26:31.208 --> 26:32.917
and you need to
shut up, Fiona.

26:32.959 --> 26:34.000
Jenny, we haven't
started the...

26:34.041 --> 26:34.709
Shit!

26:34.750 --> 26:39.583
Oh, Jenny!

26:39.625 --> 26:42.417
Keep it under there
for at least 20 minutes.

26:42.458 --> 26:44.166
Jenny, you need to
see the nurse.

26:44.208 --> 26:46.625
That's acid! And
you cut yourself.

26:46.667 --> 26:48.417
I'm gonna go take
her, okay?

26:48.458 --> 26:49.250

26:49.291 --> 26:52.291
What happened?

26:52.333 --> 26:54.208
Jenny, stop.

26:54.250 --> 26:55.792
Jenny, just stop
for a second.

26:55.834 --> 26:57.542
There is something going
on, isn't there?

26:57.583 --> 26:59.291
With you and Callaghan?

26:59.333 --> 27:00.834
No, Erica.

27:00.875 --> 27:02.834
He broke up with me
last night, so...

27:02.875 --> 27:05.458
So, no, there's absolutely
nothing going on.

27:05.500 --> 27:08.625
You need to go to the
principal about this.

27:08.667 --> 27:11.583
Jenny, you have to go
to the principal about this

27:11.625 --> 27:12.458
or I will!

27:12.500 --> 27:14.083
And I will just deny it.

27:14.125 --> 27:15.500
Listen.

27:15.542 --> 27:17.542
What he did is wrong.

27:17.583 --> 27:19.875
It wasn't just
him, okay?

27:19.917 --> 27:21.500
I did it, too,
so...

27:21.542 --> 27:24.291
So, just stay out of this,
it's none of your business.

27:24.333 --> 27:25.333
Jenny.

27:29.583 --> 27:31.583
I thought I picked up
all the glass.

27:31.625 --> 27:33.458
Not all of it.

27:35.125 --> 27:36.583

27:49.000 --> 27:50.458
Right.

27:50.500 --> 27:52.250
Yeah.

27:52.291 --> 27:54.166
They're on your desk.

27:55.166 --> 27:56.625
Well...

27:56.667 --> 27:58.250
I should get something
to eat

27:58.291 --> 28:01.417
before the only thing left
in the cafe are fries.

28:01.458 --> 28:03.959
Did you still want me
to come by after school

28:04.000 --> 28:06.792
and help you organize
all the chemicals?

28:06.834 --> 28:08.625
Nah. No, that's fine.

28:08.667 --> 28:11.083
You let that
finger heal.

28:11.125 --> 28:12.625
Thanks again for your
help, Fiona.

28:13.583 --> 28:15.208
Fiona: okay.

28:17.542 --> 28:21.166
So, Fiona, volunteering
to help?

28:23.208 --> 28:25.083
Volunteering?

29:01.583 --> 29:03.208
I need to talk to you.

29:14.667 --> 29:17.583
(low hum of chatter throughout
halls)

29:29.583 --> 29:31.083
Hey, Jenny.

29:37.166 --> 29:40.834
I guess Fiona
can't get him now.

29:40.875 --> 29:42.542
Fiona, right.

29:43.542 --> 29:45.250
You knew what
was going on there.

29:45.291 --> 29:46.667
Of course I knew.

29:46.709 --> 29:48.667
He was inviting her
to help after class

29:48.709 --> 29:50.834
and talking to her...

29:50.875 --> 29:54.375
He was doing all the same things
that he used to do with you?

29:56.750 --> 29:58.583
I really liked him.

30:00.875 --> 30:01.875
I know.

30:03.667 --> 30:05.667
Being with him was like...

30:05.709 --> 30:09.333
Having this secret
that no one knew.

30:09.375 --> 30:12.542
It made me so happy,
and now I...

30:12.583 --> 30:14.291
Now I just feel
like an idiot.

30:14.333 --> 30:15.875
Jenny, don't 'cause...

30:15.917 --> 30:17.166
It's not your
fault, okay?

30:17.208 --> 30:19.542
He just, I mean,
he used you.

30:19.583 --> 30:21.291
Right, 'cause clearly
he didn't want me

30:21.333 --> 30:24.208
for my amazing
personality.

30:24.250 --> 30:26.500
No, Callaghan knew a slut
when he saw one.

30:26.542 --> 30:28.333
Hey, Jenny, listen to me,

30:28.375 --> 30:29.959
you are wonderful.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.208
(crying)

30:34.417 --> 30:37.500
And none of this
is about you at all.

30:37.542 --> 30:39.834
He is...
He is messed up.

30:39.875 --> 30:41.709
Erica,

30:41.750 --> 30:45.250
I need to be alone
right now, okay?

30:47.083 --> 30:48.083
Okay.

30:53.875 --> 30:55.542
(shaky breaths)

30:59.834 --> 31:00.834
Oh!

31:02.417 --> 31:03.834
Oh, yikes, that's...

31:03.875 --> 31:05.000
That's the wrong
washroom.

31:05.041 --> 31:06.959
(embarrassed chuckle)

31:10.083 --> 31:12.166
(hum of employee chatter)

31:19.917 --> 31:21.291
Mimosa?

31:21.333 --> 31:22.834
No thank you.

31:24.333 --> 31:26.291
I had no idea
about Jenny.

31:26.333 --> 31:27.500
Yeah.

31:27.542 --> 31:29.125
Kind of explains a
few things, though.

31:29.166 --> 31:29.792
(sighs)

31:29.834 --> 31:30.959
It certainly does.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.875
Mr. Callaghan, he was...

31:32.917 --> 31:36.125
Just the first of many
Mr. Callaghans in her life.

31:36.166 --> 31:37.917
"there is no shame
in not knowing.

31:37.959 --> 31:40.709
The shame lies
in not finding out."

31:40.750 --> 31:41.750
Russian proverb.

31:43.709 --> 31:47.208
Of course, Julianne's situation
is totally different.

31:47.250 --> 31:48.250
Like you said,

31:48.291 --> 31:49.959
it has nothing to do
with a secret

31:50.000 --> 31:51.458
that just needs to
be told.

31:51.500 --> 31:52.875
I get it, Dr. Tom.

31:52.917 --> 31:54.625
And she's not gonna
like hearing it

31:54.667 --> 31:57.625
and I am certainly not gonna
like telling it, but...

31:57.667 --> 31:59.041
I have to.

31:59.083 --> 32:00.792
Do you?

32:00.834 --> 32:04.583
I do, because if I don't
say anything then it's...

32:04.625 --> 32:07.542
It's like I'm betraying
Julianne and I'm...

32:07.583 --> 32:09.583
I'm part of the problem.

32:14.250 --> 32:15.834
(office phones ring)

32:25.417 --> 32:26.417
What?

32:27.625 --> 32:28.583
Julianne: Just open it.

32:28.625 --> 32:29.542
What is it?

32:29.583 --> 32:31.875
It's the key to
my apartment.

32:31.917 --> 32:32.875
Oh!

32:32.917 --> 32:34.333
Julianne: Yeah.

32:34.375 --> 32:37.625
I'm so happy you're happy
because I didn't know and...

32:37.667 --> 32:39.709
I was just...
Okay, um...

32:39.750 --> 32:41.083
Happy birthday.

32:44.542 --> 32:45.792
(phone rings)

32:57.792 --> 33:00.417
(door squeals and clunks shut)

33:00.458 --> 33:03.875
oh. Knock-knock,
who's there?

33:03.917 --> 33:05.166
I'm sorry, Julianne,
but, um...

33:05.208 --> 33:07.166
There's something that
I need to tell you.

33:07.208 --> 33:08.166
Are you all right?

33:08.208 --> 33:10.000
No.

33:10.041 --> 33:12.250
Erica, what's wrong?

33:13.834 --> 33:14.500
(sighing)

33:14.542 --> 33:16.291
Okay,

33:16.333 --> 33:17.792
you're not gonna
like hearing this

33:17.834 --> 33:21.250
and there's really no easy way
of saying it.

33:21.291 --> 33:23.625
Okay, Erica, this
production is overkill.

33:23.667 --> 33:25.875
Whatever it is, I'm sure
I can handle it.

33:25.917 --> 33:27.125
So just say it
already.

33:27.166 --> 33:29.959
Friedken is cheating on you.

33:31.291 --> 33:32.417
Hmm... What?

33:32.458 --> 33:34.125
With Meeri.

33:34.166 --> 33:37.000
I caught them doing something
they shouldn't have been doing

33:37.041 --> 33:38.792
and, um, I...

33:44.417 --> 33:46.041
Thank you, Erica.

33:46.083 --> 33:47.959
I'm so sorry, Julianne,
because I know...

33:48.000 --> 33:51.834
I said thank you!
You can leave.

34:07.250 --> 34:07.917
Brent: Julianne.

34:07.959 --> 34:08.542
Brent.

34:08.583 --> 34:09.458
Are you all right?

34:09.500 --> 34:10.959
Never better.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.250
I'm sorry about
Friedken.

34:13.291 --> 34:14.792
The man's a dog.

34:14.834 --> 34:16.291
You can do so
much better.

34:16.333 --> 34:18.542
I know you thought
he was the one, but...

34:18.583 --> 34:20.250
Hang on just a second.

34:20.291 --> 34:21.625
You knew?

34:22.625 --> 34:25.834
You knew about him and Meeri
and you didn't tell me?

34:29.917 --> 34:36.208
(sobbing)

34:36.250 --> 34:38.000
(knock at the door)

34:39.750 --> 34:40.500
Hey.

34:40.542 --> 34:42.250
Hey, Erica.

34:42.291 --> 34:45.208
I'm so sorry. If you have
some work just...

34:45.250 --> 34:46.500
No, I don't.

34:47.125 --> 34:50.125
I, um, I don't
have to work, I...

34:51.083 --> 34:53.792
How awful does my
mascara look?

34:54.792 --> 34:55.792
Uh...

34:58.417 --> 34:59.917
It's pretty good,
considering.

34:59.959 --> 35:02.583
Really? It doesn't look like
I've been bawling my eyes out?

35:04.542 --> 35:06.166
Oh, great.

35:06.208 --> 35:09.625
Great! Like today wasn't
humiliating enough.

35:09.667 --> 35:12.500
Look, you have nothing
to feel humiliated about.

35:12.542 --> 35:13.875
Um... Mm...

35:13.917 --> 35:15.625
The book cover photos,

35:15.667 --> 35:17.125
the mimosas,

35:17.166 --> 35:19.542
Meeri wheeling out
a frickin' cake,

35:19.583 --> 35:21.542
the key ring,

35:21.583 --> 35:23.500
and now this,
these. Heh.

35:24.500 --> 35:26.625
You are the victim here.

35:26.667 --> 35:28.333
Wrong word choice.

35:28.375 --> 35:30.542
You know what I mean.

35:31.542 --> 35:32.792
Yeah, I do.

35:36.458 --> 35:38.959
Thank you for
telling me.

35:40.500 --> 35:41.041
(exhales)

35:41.083 --> 35:42.000
Yeah.

35:45.792 --> 35:47.041
Actually, Julianne,
just little...

35:47.083 --> 35:47.667
Yeah?

35:47.709 --> 35:50.667
Right here.

35:50.709 --> 35:52.834
That's good. Okay.
You look great.

35:52.875 --> 35:54.792
You look great.

35:54.834 --> 35:55.917
Thanks.

35:58.500 --> 36:00.000
(door clunks shut)

36:00.041 --> 36:01.542
(relieved exhale)

36:04.208 --> 36:05.792
(office phone rings)

36:06.417 --> 36:09.500
This is bad,
really bad.

36:16.500 --> 36:17.458
Thank you!

36:17.500 --> 36:18.709
Meeri, I'm sorry.

36:18.750 --> 36:20.959
I begged you, Erica, to
mind your own business.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.542
That's all.

36:22.583 --> 36:24.500
This job was
my way in.

36:26.083 --> 36:27.417
Well, then...

36:27.458 --> 36:28.667
You shouldn't have
jeopardized it

36:28.709 --> 36:30.125
the way that you did.

36:30.166 --> 36:32.667
God forbid someone should
come up behind you

36:32.709 --> 36:35.583
and steal your
thunder, right?

36:35.625 --> 36:37.500
Good luck, Erica.

36:37.542 --> 36:40.333
You are well on your way
to becoming the next Julianne.

36:44.542 --> 36:45.792
(intercom buzzes)

36:45.834 --> 36:47.750
Erica, I need to see you
and Brent in my office.

36:47.792 --> 36:48.792
Stat!

36:57.041 --> 36:59.250
First off, I'm
sure you know,

36:59.291 --> 37:03.000
Meeri is no longer an employee
here at River Rock publishing.

37:03.041 --> 37:05.250
Sometimes people just aren't
who you thought they were.

37:05.291 --> 37:07.875
Some live up to
expectations,

37:07.917 --> 37:10.667
and others...
Just disappoint you.

37:10.709 --> 37:13.083
Even when you've had
their back for years.

37:13.125 --> 37:14.125
Julianne...

37:14.166 --> 37:15.792
It takes events like
today to realize

37:15.834 --> 37:18.375
who your friends
really are.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.959
I will be looking
for a new assistant.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.667
But in the meantime,
Brent,

37:23.709 --> 37:25.917
a latte,
easy on the foam.

37:36.667 --> 37:38.583
(low hum of office chatter)

37:41.625 --> 37:42.709
(phones ring)

37:46.250 --> 37:48.667
mind if I borrow this?

37:50.959 --> 37:52.458
By all means.

37:56.667 --> 37:59.166
Hi, Ethan,
it's me again.

38:00.542 --> 38:03.041
Listen, I just... I really
need to talk to you.

38:03.083 --> 38:04.542
But I guess
you're working late,

38:04.583 --> 38:06.417
so give me a shout.

38:07.375 --> 38:09.250
Um... Can I get a
latte, please?

38:09.291 --> 38:11.291
Kai: Hey, there's a Starbucks
down the street,

38:11.333 --> 38:13.959
they make lattes,
too, you know.

38:15.834 --> 38:18.417
Can we please just
get past this?

38:18.458 --> 38:20.041
Kai: Hey.

38:20.083 --> 38:21.667
Why are you here?

38:21.709 --> 38:23.291
I'm ordering a coffee.

38:23.333 --> 38:24.333
Bullshit.

38:24.375 --> 38:25.208
Kai...

38:25.250 --> 38:26.291
What do you
want from me?

38:26.333 --> 38:27.500
Nothing.

38:27.542 --> 38:29.583
Hey, what?
Just say it.

38:29.625 --> 38:31.083
Stop with all
the dumb games

38:31.125 --> 38:33.458
and tell me what's
the big secret?

38:36.208 --> 38:38.625
My therapist, Dr. Tom,

38:39.875 --> 38:42.375
he gave me a do-over,
a day where nothing stuck.

38:42.417 --> 38:46.625
And during that day,
you and I, we hung out.

38:47.542 --> 38:49.500
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

38:49.542 --> 38:50.750
That's because
you don't remember

38:50.792 --> 38:53.458
and I do and...

38:53.500 --> 38:55.333
And we kissed.

38:56.083 --> 38:58.000
Or you kissed me.

38:59.166 --> 39:01.583
Anyway, that's why I have
been acting so weird.

39:05.875 --> 39:07.166
I kissed you.

39:07.208 --> 39:10.083
You said you wanted to know
what it would be like.

39:10.125 --> 39:11.917
So what do you
want me do?

39:11.959 --> 39:13.667
Apologize for something
I don't even remember?

39:13.709 --> 39:15.041
No, I...

39:15.083 --> 39:16.667
I'm confused because it's not
just that you kissed me,

39:16.709 --> 39:19.208
it's that... This secret
that we have,

39:19.250 --> 39:20.875
this weird thing
that we share,

39:20.917 --> 39:22.166
it's dangerous.

39:22.208 --> 39:24.166
You're the only person
I can talk to

39:24.208 --> 39:27.750
about this huge part
of my life.

39:27.792 --> 39:30.125
And I really need that.

39:30.166 --> 39:31.375
But at the same time,

39:31.417 --> 39:34.917
it cannot come between
Ethan and I.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.291
Just pretend it never
happened, okay?

39:47.417 --> 39:49.208
Okay.

39:49.250 --> 39:50.041
Bad day?

39:50.083 --> 39:52.375
(laughs)

39:52.417 --> 39:54.291
Well, I had
a session.

39:54.333 --> 39:55.583
Went back to high school.

39:55.625 --> 39:56.667
Crazy times.

39:56.709 --> 39:58.208
I'll bet.

39:58.250 --> 40:00.417
So what happened?

40:01.417 --> 40:02.375
My friend Jenny,

40:02.417 --> 40:04.208
she was organizing
this fashion show

40:04.250 --> 40:06.750
and there was this really
uptight girl in our class...

40:11.417 --> 40:14.583
When I promoted you to editorial
director of non-fiction,

40:14.625 --> 40:18.166
it was because I believed
you had the chops.

40:18.208 --> 40:19.417
But it's becoming
increasingly evident

40:19.458 --> 40:21.166
that you're running
a gong-show.

40:21.208 --> 40:22.166
Frank, let me explain.

40:22.208 --> 40:24.166
I was prepared
to turn a blind eye,

40:24.208 --> 40:25.375
but your indiscretions

40:25.417 --> 40:28.291
have become an embarrassment
to the company.

40:28.333 --> 40:30.291
I'll be out of town
for two weeks.

40:30.333 --> 40:32.083
This situation had better
be cleared up

40:32.125 --> 40:33.625
by the time I
get back.

40:33.667 --> 40:34.834
Frank, I apologize

40:34.875 --> 40:36.417
for any embarrassment
that I have created

40:36.458 --> 40:38.583
and let me assure you,

40:38.625 --> 40:42.250
this will be dealt
with immediately.

40:45.375 --> 40:47.375
(phone clatters onto cradle)

40:48.375 --> 40:49.792
(traffic hums along)

40:54.041 --> 40:55.792
That's the thing,

40:55.834 --> 40:58.250
time doesn't exist.

40:58.291 --> 40:59.375
It's not quantifiable.

40:59.417 --> 41:02.291
So, if I'm looking forward
to tomorrow,

41:02.333 --> 41:04.542
I'm really just
doing it all today,

41:04.583 --> 41:07.625
but a today that's
yet to come.

41:07.667 --> 41:11.166
Do you understand
what I'm... Getting at?

41:11.208 --> 41:12.750
Friedken?

41:12.792 --> 41:14.917
Yes, my muse?

41:14.959 --> 41:18.875
I'm not sure anyone understands
what you're talking about.

41:18.917 --> 41:20.500
Clearly, working
from River Rock

41:20.542 --> 41:23.250
is just clouding
your judgment.

41:24.250 --> 41:25.625
So, maybe it's time you...

41:25.667 --> 41:27.875
Started working from somewhere
that just isn't here.

41:35.291 --> 41:37.291
(half laughs, unsure)

41:37.333 --> 41:40.333
But, Jules, I love
working here.

41:41.333 --> 41:43.667
Yes, clearly, you love it
a little too much.

41:43.709 --> 41:44.792
(bag jingles)

41:53.875 --> 41:57.792
Oh, and I'm gonna need
the key back, too.

41:59.417 --> 42:03.458
Oh gee, you know,
I forgot I even had that.

42:03.500 --> 42:05.125
Glad you reminded me.

42:08.458 --> 42:09.709
And finally,

42:09.750 --> 42:11.792
just to take some of the
"mystery" out of tomorrow

42:11.834 --> 42:14.375
for you...

42:14.417 --> 42:16.875
I'll be expecting chapters
one through six on my desk

42:16.917 --> 42:17.959
by the morning.

42:28.583 --> 42:29.417
(keys jangle)

42:31.542 --> 42:34.041
Erica: when a secret lurks
just around the corner,

42:34.083 --> 42:36.333
sometimes you have
to ask yourself,

42:36.375 --> 42:38.291
do you really
wanna know?

42:38.333 --> 42:41.125
(video game music plays
and beeps)

42:45.333 --> 42:47.250
Hey! Surprise!

42:47.291 --> 42:48.417
What is this?

42:48.458 --> 42:50.458
It's our first mutual
housewarming gift.

42:50.500 --> 42:53.667
A killer 42 inch lcd tv
and a playstation 3.

42:53.709 --> 42:55.208
Thank you,
summer school.

42:55.250 --> 42:57.625
So this is your big secret
this morning?

42:57.667 --> 43:00.208
I get to kick your ass
in hi-def?

43:00.250 --> 43:01.250
Mmm...

43:03.375 --> 43:05.083
So, what took you so
long, anyway?

43:05.125 --> 43:07.500
Julianne keep you
late again?

43:07.542 --> 43:09.834
Erica: To reveal or
not to reveal?

43:09.875 --> 43:11.834
It's the hardest question.

43:11.875 --> 43:15.000
Yeah, we just had some
notes to go over.

43:15.041 --> 43:17.834
All right,
are you ready?

43:17.875 --> 43:21.667
Because our secrets are
the invisible burden we carry,

43:21.709 --> 43:23.959
some are worth keeping

43:24.000 --> 43:25.917
while others
just need to be told,

43:25.959 --> 43:28.250
and the trick
is knowing the difference.
