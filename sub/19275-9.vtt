The symbol of the wanderer

00:03.643 --> 00:05.310
who finally stops his wandering.

00:05.312 --> 00:08.235
After it ended,
I couldn't get the clasp to open

00:08.270 --> 00:10.348
and just kinda got used to having it on.

00:10.980 --> 00:11.749
- Boom.
<i>- We are all...</i>

00:12.241 --> 00:14.842
all five of us...
in the exact same boat.

00:14.844 --> 00:18.412
We run, the feds catch us,
or the Doctor kills us.

00:18.414 --> 00:20.214
<i>I have a plan.</i>

00:20.216 --> 00:20.993
<i>What do we do?</i>

00:20.993 --> 00:23.504
<i>You will each have specific jobs.</i>

00:24.924 --> 00:27.822
<i>- Pretty discreet, huh?
- Yeah, I'd never notice it.</i>

00:27.824 --> 00:30.424
I can't wait to make you my wife.

00:30.426 --> 00:32.159
I can't wait to be your wife.

00:32.161 --> 00:33.160
You'll be sorry if you marry her!

00:33.162 --> 00:34.261
What the hell was that?

00:34.263 --> 00:35.563
I thought he was working with her.

00:35.565 --> 00:37.665
The whole lame brother
backstory and everything?

00:37.667 --> 00:39.600
This actually might be good for us.

00:39.602 --> 00:41.202
I know you're in the FBI.

00:41.204 --> 00:42.403
- I'm not.
- Don't.

00:42.405 --> 00:43.571
Uh-oh.

00:43.573 --> 00:46.273
Dad left the liquor cabinet open.

00:46.275 --> 00:49.376
Stupid Dad.

00:49.378 --> 00:51.212
The service here was incredible.

00:51.214 --> 00:53.047
- Thanks.
- Oh, my God,

00:53.049 --> 00:55.082
- he's like a boner with a body.
- Now that's funny.

00:55.084 --> 00:57.284
- What's your angle?
- Immunity.

00:57.286 --> 00:58.681
I get you the Doctor,

00:58.681 --> 01:00.788
you get me someplace new to start over.

01:00.790 --> 01:03.691
Ezra Bloom, my ex, Max,
my right-hand man...

01:03.693 --> 01:05.693
You have to leave them
alone for this to play out.

01:05.695 --> 01:07.795
- Do we have a deal?
- I'm gonna need the ring.

01:07.797 --> 01:09.130
Oh, this?

01:14.403 --> 01:16.403
<i>I got you on credit card fraud,</i>

01:16.405 --> 01:18.139
I got you on identity theft,

01:18.141 --> 01:20.207
and I got you on petty larceny.

01:20.209 --> 01:22.877
So you are going to do whatever it is

01:22.879 --> 01:25.946
I need you to do to take her down.

<i>Maybe it's true, what some people say...</i>

01:37.326 --> 01:42.496
<i>Who you are is just a
collection of choices...</i>

01:42.498 --> 01:45.266

01:45.268 --> 01:47.601

01:47.603 --> 01:49.703

<i>Choice has everything to do with it.</i>

Only question is

02:22.004 --> 02:23.537
what choice are you gonna make?

02:53.369 --> 02:54.227
What's up?

02:54.227 --> 02:55.836
I told you right from the start,

02:55.838 --> 02:57.972
we can't depend on these amateurs.

02:57.974 --> 02:59.840
Calm down. What happened?

02:59.842 --> 03:01.342
It's quarter after 11:00,
and I'm sitting here,

03:01.344 --> 03:03.143
trying to fight off an aneurism,

03:03.145 --> 03:05.145
because Richard is a no-show.

03:05.147 --> 03:06.714
<i>The wedding is in two days, Maddie.</i>

03:06.716 --> 03:08.983
Rehearsal's tomorrow.
If they can't be depended on...

03:08.985 --> 03:10.718
Okay, take a breath.

03:10.720 --> 03:13.082
I-I'll find Richard.
Everything's under control.

03:13.082 --> 03:16.523
God damn it,
it doesn't feel like it, does it?

03:16.525 --> 03:17.625
Shit.

03:21.183 --> 03:22.796
Oh, yeah, that's a good one.

03:22.798 --> 03:25.499
- Let me see.
- It's a really good one.

03:25.501 --> 03:27.234
- Ew, no, I hate my hair.
- Oh...

03:27.236 --> 03:29.336
come on, your hair looks great.
It just looks like

03:29.338 --> 03:31.372
you had a really good time last night.

03:31.374 --> 03:33.374
I did. Your turn.

03:33.376 --> 03:35.042
- Ah, no.
- Your turn... hey.

03:35.044 --> 03:36.543
No, let's... let's not do that.

03:36.545 --> 03:38.178
Oh, my God, let me guess.
You're married.

03:38.180 --> 03:39.647
- You're totally cheating.
- What? No.

03:39.649 --> 03:41.882
Hey, I'm not married. I just...

03:41.884 --> 03:44.018
- I gotta...
- Lie faster.

03:44.020 --> 03:45.753
Okay, okay, look, here's the thing.

03:45.755 --> 03:49.556
Listen, I'm not really the CEO
of a robotics corporation.

03:49.558 --> 03:51.592
Dude, you're staying
at the Roadrunner Inn,

03:51.594 --> 03:54.228
- so, yeah, no kidding.
- So?

03:54.230 --> 03:56.363
God, why do guys always do this?

03:56.365 --> 03:59.266
Why do you think that you have to
pretend to be somebody else?

03:59.268 --> 04:00.467
All right, all right.
Hey, uh, you're right.

04:00.469 --> 04:02.269
I'm sorry okay?

04:02.271 --> 04:04.805
It's a very long story,
and it's very boring,

04:04.807 --> 04:07.708
and I will tell you next time, okay?

04:11.514 --> 04:12.549
Wait, wh...

04:13.516 --> 04:15.282
- Hey, don't... don't delete it.
- Oh, what are you gonna do?

04:15.284 --> 04:17.317
You gonna pout about
it like a little baby?

04:17.320 --> 04:20.387
- Oh, you're in trouble now.
- Is that what you're gonna do?

04:21.202 --> 04:22.456
How much trouble am I in?

04:22.458 --> 04:23.958
- A lot of trouble.
- Why don't you tell me

04:23.960 --> 04:25.492
how much trouble.

04:30.499 --> 04:32.700
- Oh! Hey...
- What the f... is this?

04:32.702 --> 04:34.501
- You are married.
- No, I'm not mar...

04:34.503 --> 04:36.370
I'm... I'm kinda.
It's very complicated, okay?

04:36.372 --> 04:38.973
Ugh, what is this?
Some kinda game you freaks play?

04:39.427 --> 04:40.674
No, it's not a game.

04:40.676 --> 04:43.344
- I mean, hey, it could be if...
- Ugh, oh, my God.

04:43.346 --> 04:44.712
Time to go, honey.

04:44.714 --> 04:46.914
Okay, hey, first of all,
my name is Kara.

04:46.916 --> 04:48.749
- Bye, Kara.
- Hey, that's my shirt.

04:48.751 --> 04:50.317
Just so you know, I was lied to.

04:50.319 --> 04:51.885
Yeah, join the club.

04:51.887 --> 04:53.354
- Kara, that's...
- Are you kidding me?

04:53.356 --> 04:55.255
You were supposed to meet
with Max this morning.

04:55.257 --> 04:57.636
Oh, sure, I was.

04:57.671 --> 05:00.361
He said after breakfast,
and it's still after breakfast.

05:00.363 --> 05:02.696
Richard, I need your head in the game.

05:02.698 --> 05:04.098
- Ow! Okay! Whoa!
- This head,

05:04.100 --> 05:05.265
or none of this is going to work.

05:05.267 --> 05:07.668
All right, sue me.
I was having sex, okay?

05:07.670 --> 05:09.269
Some of us have sex because we like it,

05:09.271 --> 05:11.872
- not 'cause it's our job.
- Oh, really?

05:11.874 --> 05:13.273
Did you get it out of your system?

05:13.275 --> 05:14.351
- Yep, I did.
- Yeah?

05:14.351 --> 05:16.543
You feel better now?
Can you actually do your job?

05:16.545 --> 05:19.013
You know what,
don't talk to me like I'm that guy,

05:19.015 --> 05:20.814
some jerk with no self-control.

05:20.816 --> 05:22.816
You know, Alice never would've
talked to me like that.

05:22.818 --> 05:24.284
I loved Alice because
she was supportive.

05:24.286 --> 05:26.620
Jesus, when are you going
to understand this?

05:26.622 --> 05:28.322
You were never in love with me.

05:28.324 --> 05:31.325
You were in love with who you
were when you were with me.

05:33.963 --> 05:36.163
Huh...

05:36.165 --> 05:37.831
I gotta unpack that.

05:39.672 --> 05:41.769
Yo, mind your own business.

05:41.941 --> 05:42.803
Hard to do

05:42.805 --> 05:44.905
since you can hear
everything through the wall.

05:44.907 --> 05:46.206
Everything.

05:46.208 --> 05:47.426
Well, I hope you enjoyed the show.

05:47.426 --> 05:49.376
Oh, I did. I especially like the part

05:49.378 --> 05:51.545
when you laughed hysterically
right after you came.

05:51.547 --> 05:52.846
Or was it during?

05:52.848 --> 05:54.481
It was after because it tickles,

05:54.483 --> 05:55.582
and I'm just trying
to bring a little joy

05:55.584 --> 05:56.950
to your sad, miserable little life.

05:56.952 --> 05:58.285
Wow, I should go unpack then.

05:58.287 --> 05:59.620
Enough, both of you!

05:59.622 --> 06:01.422
Why? What do you do after sex, huh?

06:01.424 --> 06:03.090
You probably roll over
and weep, don't you?

06:03.092 --> 06:04.358
- Shut up.
- You don't...

06:04.360 --> 06:06.260
- Richard... Richard, go.
- Does she? Do you cry?

06:06.262 --> 06:09.329
- Oh, my God, no, she doesn't.
- For f... 's sake, go!

06:13.002 --> 06:15.269
- Let me see the art piece.
- It's not finished.

06:15.271 --> 06:16.837
I'm not asking.

06:22.478 --> 06:25.179
Now this doesn't have to be so hard.

06:25.181 --> 06:28.015
In fact, this can be pretty simple.

06:28.017 --> 06:30.451
See, I already know who you are.

06:30.453 --> 06:32.553
You're not Maddie's
brother from Pottsville.

06:32.555 --> 06:36.056
You're Ezra Bloom from Indianapolis,

06:36.058 --> 06:38.826
and you're a good man.

06:38.828 --> 06:41.195
A good man?

06:41.197 --> 06:42.596
At least up until now.

06:44.900 --> 06:47.468
You know, before I met Maddie,

06:47.470 --> 06:49.903
I'd never really been in love.

06:49.905 --> 06:52.005
I mean, I thought I had once in college,

06:52.007 --> 06:54.508
but I never really gave it a chance.

06:54.510 --> 06:56.510
I was always on the lookout
for something more...

06:56.512 --> 06:59.346
Some fantasy or something.

07:01.250 --> 07:04.151
And I started to think maybe...

07:04.153 --> 07:06.954
maybe there's something wrong with me.

07:06.956 --> 07:08.655
Uh, you know, 'cause I...

07:08.657 --> 07:10.290
I don't know why I can't feel that thing

07:10.292 --> 07:13.026
that everybody else can feel.

07:13.028 --> 07:16.363
And then I met Maddie,

07:16.365 --> 07:19.466
and I knew I wasn't broken.

07:19.468 --> 07:21.869
You called me a good man.

07:21.871 --> 07:24.538
I don't know.

07:24.540 --> 07:26.473
All I know...

07:26.475 --> 07:31.378
is that I'm no longer just
Ezra Bloom from Indianapolis.

07:35.050 --> 07:38.085
All right, like I said,
it's not finished yet, okay?

07:48.497 --> 07:52.299
Yeah... You don't have to say anything.

07:52.301 --> 07:54.134
I love it.

07:54.136 --> 07:56.470
Really? Thanks.

07:56.472 --> 07:58.305
I mean, I-I wanted
a really simple concept,

07:58.307 --> 08:00.340
and I thought the fabric
on top would really help.

08:00.342 --> 08:02.476
How does the money switch work?

08:05.447 --> 08:08.148
Of course. What was... I expecting?

08:08.150 --> 08:09.449
This isn't even art to you.

08:09.451 --> 08:11.985
It's just a prop for your little scheme.

08:13.789 --> 08:18.625
The, uh... the art piece
goes into the gift room.

08:19.089 --> 08:21.929
I switch out the real money

08:21.931 --> 08:24.965
with the fake money.

08:24.967 --> 08:26.333
Voila.

08:28.037 --> 08:30.804
Does that suit your standards,
Your Highness?

08:30.806 --> 08:33.506
Yeah.

08:33.509 --> 08:35.308
It'll work.

08:35.311 --> 08:38.477
Do you even know this is
the first thing I've made since...

08:42.183 --> 08:44.618
I'm not doing any of this for you.

08:44.620 --> 08:46.620
Yeah, well,
whoever it is you're doing it for,

08:46.622 --> 08:49.289
it's perfect.

08:49.291 --> 08:51.458
At least someone's doing their job.

08:53.162 --> 08:56.029
<i>- "Arr" you home?</i>
- I'm down here.

08:56.900 --> 08:58.265
All right.

08:58.267 --> 09:01.468
Is it still after breakfast?
Brought donuts.

09:01.470 --> 09:03.637
Man, you should've seen
Maddie this morning, man.

09:03.639 --> 09:04.972
She was in a mood.

09:04.974 --> 09:06.640
You bring what I asked you to get?

09:07.608 --> 09:08.408
Listen, man,

09:08.410 --> 09:09.676
I'm sorry if there was some confusion...

09:09.678 --> 09:11.678
Confusion? Oh, I'm not confused.

09:11.680 --> 09:14.348
Are you confused?

09:14.350 --> 09:16.850
Uh, I got your stuff.

09:21.790 --> 09:23.657
- What's this?
- Mustache.

09:23.659 --> 09:25.792
- Different...
- I said human hair,

09:25.794 --> 09:27.261
applied with Telesis.

09:27.263 --> 09:28.795
Yeah, the guy at the costume store...

09:28.797 --> 09:30.330
The costume store?

09:30.332 --> 09:31.632
Look, I can go back if you want me to...

09:31.634 --> 09:32.684
Do you think we're
trick-or-treating here?

09:32.684 --> 09:33.525
Is that what you think?

09:33.525 --> 09:36.470
That we're going to the f...
ing Renaissance Faire?

09:40.442 --> 09:42.309
- I'll go back.
- No, sit down.

09:42.311 --> 09:46.346
Sit down. We're gonna do this right.

09:53.812 --> 09:56.581
Here's what I think.
You're the victim in all this.

09:57.153 --> 09:58.919
You simply got caught in the web

09:58.921 --> 10:01.956
of a very gifted con artist.

10:01.958 --> 10:05.793
I'm fully aware of how
charming she can be.

10:08.097 --> 10:09.763
Oh, man,

10:09.765 --> 10:12.099
I bet you are.
I bet you know all about it.

10:12.101 --> 10:13.500
All right, come on, knock it off.

10:13.502 --> 10:15.135
- I had a job to do.
- No, no, no, you know...

10:15.137 --> 10:16.437
it's, uh... it's one thing

10:16.439 --> 10:19.139
you guys have in common, I guess, uh...

10:19.141 --> 10:21.342
devotion to your work.

10:21.344 --> 10:23.644
<i>Well, I don't know
if I'd put it that way,</i>

10:23.646 --> 10:25.679
<i>but I suppose.</i>

10:26.749 --> 10:28.616
You know what she told me?

10:30.920 --> 10:34.788
She said that with you... it was real.

10:36.792 --> 10:38.759
Of course, that was probably a lie too.

10:38.761 --> 10:41.262
Well, that's what liars do.

10:41.264 --> 10:43.264
- They lie.
- Yeah.

10:43.266 --> 10:45.699
Yeah, well...

10:45.701 --> 10:47.668
Or maybe she did feel something,

10:47.670 --> 10:49.937
because, uh, I mean, when you guys met,

10:49.939 --> 10:53.774
you... you weren't even
her mark, were you?

10:53.776 --> 10:55.609
She was mine.

10:55.611 --> 10:57.044
Okay.

10:57.046 --> 11:01.415
So maybe the real question
is did you feel something?

11:01.417 --> 11:03.250
Doesn't really matter
at this point, does it?

11:03.252 --> 11:04.952
Well, I don't know, man.

11:04.954 --> 11:06.620
It kinda pisses me off, to be honest...

11:06.622 --> 11:08.389
You just sitting there, telling me, uh,

11:08.391 --> 11:11.258
I'm a victim, like you're above it...

11:11.260 --> 11:13.427
Like you were in control the whole time.

11:13.429 --> 11:15.062
I don't know.

11:15.064 --> 11:17.598
I call bullshit.

11:17.600 --> 11:20.100
You fell for her, didn't you?

11:20.102 --> 11:22.503
Come on...

11:22.505 --> 11:24.471
tell me you never felt something

11:24.473 --> 11:27.841
the whole time you were with her.

11:27.843 --> 11:29.777
Tell me you never loved her.

11:37.586 --> 11:39.086
Sit tight.

11:44.627 --> 11:46.293
This is your proposal?

11:46.295 --> 11:48.796
You want me to put 500,000
real American dollars

11:48.798 --> 11:50.798
into a bag and hope
that everything turns out

11:50.800 --> 11:52.866
because you trust a con artist?

11:52.868 --> 11:54.635
I know it's not
the original plan, but...

11:54.637 --> 11:56.036
Oh, no, I read it.

11:56.038 --> 11:58.439
It's very thorough,
except you left out the part

11:58.441 --> 12:00.708
that this operation is
totally compromised.

12:00.710 --> 12:02.743
Agent Cook, this is the better play.

12:02.745 --> 12:04.645
Maddie tells the Doctor they
found the missing money.

12:04.647 --> 12:06.580
He comes to claim it.

12:06.582 --> 12:08.336
Once he takes the bait,
we've got our man

12:08.371 --> 12:11.378
on mail fraud, grand theft larceny,
money laundering.

12:11.378 --> 12:13.620
We don't have to wait
until after the marriage.

12:13.622 --> 12:16.323
How do you know she hasn't already
told the Doctor you're FBI?

12:16.325 --> 12:18.392
Because if she did, he'd kill her.

12:18.394 --> 12:20.461
And she really wants out.

12:20.463 --> 12:22.162
This I know for a fact.

12:23.833 --> 12:26.567
And the loose ends?
Ezra Bloom in custody...

12:26.569 --> 12:28.135
I convince Ezra to cooperate,

12:28.137 --> 12:30.070
we use him to keep tabs on Maddie,

12:30.072 --> 12:31.638
and make sure everything's
going forward.

12:31.640 --> 12:33.674
And what about the girlfriend, Jules?

12:33.676 --> 12:35.109
We think she's a civilian.

12:35.111 --> 12:36.777
You think? Figure it out.

12:36.779 --> 12:38.979
- I want eyes on her.
- Got it.

12:40.483 --> 12:41.789
All right.

12:43.486 --> 12:45.586
I will approve this deal
on one condition.

12:45.588 --> 12:50.758
You give me solid hard evidence
that the Doctor will show up.

12:50.760 --> 12:52.626
No surprises. Get it done.

12:52.628 --> 12:54.328
Yes, ma'am.

12:54.330 --> 12:55.692
Patrick...

12:58.034 --> 12:59.900
This work can mess with your head

12:59.902 --> 13:02.369
and your heart.

13:02.371 --> 13:03.797
Be careful.

13:05.107 --> 13:06.907
I gotcha, loud and clear.

13:16.152 --> 13:19.386
Can I ask you something?

13:19.388 --> 13:22.589
You probably know Maddie better than...

13:22.591 --> 13:25.726
well, anybody, right?

13:25.728 --> 13:27.594
What makes you think that?

13:27.596 --> 13:30.964
I mean, we were all married to her,

13:30.966 --> 13:33.767
but, like, that whole time,

13:33.769 --> 13:36.937
you actually knew the real person.

13:36.939 --> 13:38.472
Well, maybe, maybe not.

13:38.474 --> 13:40.007
Who's to say what's real about a person?

13:40.009 --> 13:43.744
No, only they can know that.
And even then...

13:43.746 --> 13:47.147
Can you honestly say you
know who you really are?

13:49.952 --> 13:52.686
I mean, not anymore,

13:52.688 --> 13:56.690
but I know who I wanted to be.

13:59.028 --> 14:02.062
So this guy that you wanted to be...

14:02.064 --> 14:05.866
What's stopping you from
becoming that person?

14:05.868 --> 14:08.235
I don't know. I guess when Alice left,

14:08.237 --> 14:11.805
I just sort of stopped believing in him.

14:11.807 --> 14:14.875
So the one stopping you is you, huh?

14:19.815 --> 14:21.882
- Smile.
- Hmm?

14:21.884 --> 14:23.650
I said smile.
You know how to smile, don't ya?

14:23.652 --> 14:25.252
Smile.

14:25.254 --> 14:27.988
Well, not like an idiot.
Just a regular smile.

14:27.990 --> 14:31.758
You know. Uh, the trick is to smile

14:31.760 --> 14:33.093
when you're putting on a mustache.

14:33.095 --> 14:35.729
Otherwise, no matter
how good the adhesive,

14:35.731 --> 14:38.465
your facial movement will force it off.

14:41.837 --> 14:43.737
There.

14:45.274 --> 14:46.940
I'll say this for you, kid.

14:46.942 --> 14:48.320
You got a good smile.

14:55.684 --> 14:57.918
Hello?

14:57.920 --> 15:00.554
Hey, you can't just leave me in here.

15:00.556 --> 15:01.722
Hello?

15:03.559 --> 15:05.559
Hey... hey, man, you know
you can't keep me indefinitely.

15:05.561 --> 15:07.761
You know, that is a thing.

15:07.763 --> 15:09.296
Sit down.

15:18.641 --> 15:20.240
Open it.

15:24.747 --> 15:26.613
- Jesus.
- Mm-hmm.

15:26.615 --> 15:28.215
Keep going.

15:28.217 --> 15:29.983
You see, these people...

15:29.985 --> 15:32.319
they used to work for
the Doctor as well.

15:32.321 --> 15:35.389
It seems he's got a pretty strict policy
when it comes to loyalty.

15:38.394 --> 15:40.627
I don't believe you.

15:40.629 --> 15:42.729
I don't care what you believe.

15:42.731 --> 15:44.898
He's running cons all
across the country,

15:44.900 --> 15:46.600
pulling in millions of dollars a year

15:46.602 --> 15:48.769
and leaving a trail of bodies
when it suits him.

15:48.771 --> 15:51.605
Maybe you're next. I don't know.

15:51.607 --> 15:54.007
Shit, maybe you've ruined
your own life so much

15:54.009 --> 15:57.244
that you just don't have
anything left to lose.

15:57.246 --> 16:00.948
Whatever. But know this...

16:00.950 --> 16:03.217
This is gonna happen to Maddie,

16:03.219 --> 16:06.954
and you have the power to stop it.

16:06.956 --> 16:10.591
So if you wanna make sure she
doesn't end up in a ditch,

16:10.593 --> 16:12.259
I'm gonna need you to help me.

16:16.732 --> 16:18.732
You can keep her safe.

16:18.734 --> 16:21.935
You help me, we get the Doctor.

16:21.937 --> 16:24.271
We get the Doctor,

16:24.273 --> 16:26.240
you saved her life.

16:35.618 --> 16:38.619
Well, what would I need to do?

16:38.621 --> 16:40.053
Good.

16:40.055 --> 16:42.422
Do you know where she keeps her phone?

16:42.424 --> 16:43.790
In her purse, I guess.

16:43.792 --> 16:45.792
No, no, no, not the personal.
The burner.

16:45.794 --> 16:46.613
No.

16:46.613 --> 16:49.896
First thing you're gonna
need to do is find it.

16:52.635 --> 16:55.569
I'm gonna teach you how to
turn it into a microphone.

16:57.206 --> 17:00.941
Ezra Bloom... welcome to the FBI.

17:27.515 --> 17:31.350
- Oh, my God!
- Oh... Hi.

17:31.352 --> 17:34.786
- What are you doing here?
- Yeah, well, I'm an artist.

17:34.788 --> 17:38.757
And, uh... what are you doing here?

17:38.759 --> 17:41.093
Oh, I... I decided
I was gonna get all ambitious

17:41.095 --> 17:43.962
and make this wedding scrapbook thing,

17:43.964 --> 17:45.797
but then I realized I have
no idea what I'm doing,

17:45.799 --> 17:47.744
so I was gonna ask for help, but then...

17:49.652 --> 17:50.836
What are you doing?

17:50.838 --> 17:53.438
- What are you making?
- Um, yeah,

17:53.440 --> 17:56.408
my present for the wedding.

17:56.410 --> 17:58.377
Kind of an art piece.

17:58.379 --> 18:00.212
Oh, that's awesome.

18:00.214 --> 18:01.880
I don't know.

18:01.882 --> 18:05.417
So my brother is about to marry

18:05.419 --> 18:07.619
the sister of your boyfriend,

18:07.621 --> 18:12.424
so that kinda makes us something...

18:12.426 --> 18:16.261
- I guess.
- Yeah, something.

18:16.263 --> 18:18.830
Well, I think that sounds like
a good excuse to get lunch

18:18.832 --> 18:20.666
and just get to know each other.

18:20.668 --> 18:22.801
Ah, I would...

18:22.803 --> 18:24.436
Come on. Look, I'll pay.

18:24.933 --> 18:28.941
I need pro tips from a real artist.

18:28.943 --> 18:31.276
I really do.

18:31.278 --> 18:33.245
Um...

18:33.247 --> 18:35.347
yeah, let's do it.

18:44.925 --> 18:46.658
Thanks for coming.

18:48.829 --> 18:51.496
Any particular reason
you wanted to meet here?

18:51.498 --> 18:53.532
Oh, coffee's good.

18:53.534 --> 18:55.100
Happened to be close.

18:55.102 --> 18:57.769
Not because this is where we first met?

18:57.771 --> 19:00.739
Where you lured in your mark?

19:00.741 --> 19:03.275
Well, maybe I am a little nostalgic.

19:10.284 --> 19:13.285
Terms of my surrender.

19:13.287 --> 19:15.254
No, not surrender.

19:15.256 --> 19:16.421
Freedom.

19:18.492 --> 19:20.425
Well...

19:20.427 --> 19:23.428
Never thought witness protection
would be considered freedom.

19:23.430 --> 19:25.430
Maddie, it's a chance to start over.

19:25.432 --> 19:27.633
All I've ever done is start over.

19:29.492 --> 19:31.403
Well, maybe this time
it can be for real.

19:31.405 --> 19:34.973
You know, for a minute there,

19:34.975 --> 19:37.809
that's what I thought
you and I were doing.

19:39.813 --> 19:41.613
You have a deal.

19:45.923 --> 19:47.686
A little while.

19:48.918 --> 19:50.522
How did you and Ezra meet?

19:50.524 --> 19:54.359
Oh, you know, online. Online dating.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.361
Yeah.

19:56.363 --> 19:58.365
So what about you?
Are... are you married?

19:58.365 --> 20:00.766
Me? No. No.

20:00.768 --> 20:02.501
Not yet.

20:02.503 --> 20:05.904
Haven't found the... lucky lady.

20:08.475 --> 20:11.209
Do you guys live together?
Because I'm starting to think...

20:11.211 --> 20:13.011
You know, I dated a woman once.

20:13.013 --> 20:15.447
Yeah?

20:15.449 --> 20:17.482
Oh, come on, you didn't, like, know?

20:17.484 --> 20:18.984
- Really?
- What?

20:18.986 --> 20:21.153
You didn't have like a... like a sense?

20:21.155 --> 20:22.387
I don't make assumptions about people.

20:22.389 --> 20:23.784
I think it's more fun to be surprised.

20:23.784 --> 20:25.357
Ah, so you're... you're surprised?

20:25.359 --> 20:26.825
I didn't say that.

20:30.675 --> 20:34.666
So what was she like?
This... this woman?

20:37.304 --> 20:40.372
Um, when I first met her,

20:40.374 --> 20:42.040
I knew in my gut that she was bad news.

20:43.117 --> 20:45.877
Scared the shit out of me.

20:45.879 --> 20:48.580
But... it felt good.

20:48.582 --> 20:52.084
It felt good to be afraid?

20:52.086 --> 20:54.986
To be afraid of something
other than myself.

20:54.988 --> 20:56.988
And it was a relief... like...

20:56.990 --> 21:00.492
suddenly, there was no room
for all my usual fears

21:00.494 --> 21:03.261
always holding me back.

21:03.263 --> 21:07.499
And how could I be?
I was consumed by fear of her...

21:07.501 --> 21:10.602
of her getting bored, of her leaving.

21:10.604 --> 21:12.807
Kind of a messed up freedom, but...

21:13.273 --> 21:15.907
So then what happened?

21:15.909 --> 21:17.943
Should've trusted my gut.

21:19.947 --> 21:23.148
So she broke your heart.

21:23.150 --> 21:26.485
So what did your gut say,
uh, when you met me?

21:27.422 --> 21:28.864
That you liked Amarula.

21:28.864 --> 21:30.212
That's all?

21:32.359 --> 21:34.126
You ask a lot of questions.

21:34.128 --> 21:36.161
Wait, what do you do again?

21:36.163 --> 21:38.296
I'm an investigator.

21:38.298 --> 21:42.200
An insurance investigator, so...

21:42.202 --> 21:45.470
questions are an occupational hazard.

21:45.472 --> 21:47.839
Or maybe you're just interested.

21:50.411 --> 21:52.677
Maybe I'm just interested.

23:21.435 --> 23:23.435
Jesus.

23:23.437 --> 23:25.537
We need to talk.

23:27.992 --> 23:30.560
What are you doing here?
How'd you get in?

23:30.562 --> 23:32.829
Oh, I've learned
a few tricks along the way.

23:32.831 --> 23:34.629
Hm. What do you want?

23:34.629 --> 23:38.401
You know what?
I'm asking the questions today.

23:38.403 --> 23:40.670
Come and sit down.

23:41.640 --> 23:43.606
This should be interesting.

23:48.780 --> 23:50.213
Shoot.

23:52.284 --> 23:55.585
The whole time I was searching for you,

23:55.587 --> 23:58.121
I thought I was looking for revenge

23:58.123 --> 24:00.223
or justice or, uh...

24:00.225 --> 24:03.026
<i>I don't know...
for you to love me again.</i>

24:03.028 --> 24:05.361
<i>I guess at the very least,
I wanted to find...</i>

24:05.363 --> 24:07.730
Agent Simons, mic's in. We got audio.

24:07.732 --> 24:09.132
<i>I wanted to make trouble for you.</i>

24:09.134 --> 24:11.034
<i>I wanted to screw up your next con.</i>

24:11.036 --> 24:12.519
<i>But I don't give a shit
about your next con.</i>

24:12.519 --> 24:15.939
Ezra, what do you need?

24:15.941 --> 24:17.640
Answers.

24:17.642 --> 24:19.742
How does a girl from Pottsville

24:19.744 --> 24:23.880
become... whatever you are?

24:23.882 --> 24:26.382
- That's what you want?
- That's what I want.

24:26.384 --> 24:28.418
That's all I want.

24:33.625 --> 24:37.627
My parents...
the ones you met in Pottsville...

24:37.629 --> 24:39.662
they adopted me when I was eight.

24:39.664 --> 24:42.432
Till then, I was living with my grandma

24:42.434 --> 24:44.901
and her boyfriend.

24:44.903 --> 24:48.104
She...

24:48.106 --> 24:51.374
She would leave me alone with him.

24:51.376 --> 24:54.911
So I would go to the nearest mall,

24:54.913 --> 24:57.547
and I would pick a new family.

24:57.549 --> 25:00.550
<i>Every time, a different family...</i>

25:00.552 --> 25:05.855
A nice one that I could maybe fit into.

25:05.857 --> 25:08.858
And I would follow them around the mall.

25:08.860 --> 25:14.564
I'd pretend to be the kid
that trails just a little behind.

25:14.566 --> 25:19.469
One day, I was following this
mother and two daughters.

25:19.471 --> 25:21.938
Followed them out into the parking lot,

25:21.940 --> 25:24.707
into their car,

25:24.709 --> 25:27.243
and I thought...

25:27.245 --> 25:30.547
maybe they can be my family.

25:30.549 --> 25:33.950
Anyway, they took me to the police.

25:33.952 --> 25:36.986
Then foster care,

25:36.988 --> 25:39.589
and that's a whole other...

25:39.591 --> 25:41.791
rougher story.

25:45.063 --> 25:46.696
Bullshit.

25:51.269 --> 25:52.835
Fine. I grew up in a boarding school

25:52.837 --> 25:55.004
outside of Boston.

25:55.006 --> 25:57.674
It was run by the CIA.

25:57.676 --> 26:01.030
We were all orphans...
children of murdered spies...

26:01.065 --> 26:01.825
Bullshit.

26:01.825 --> 26:03.613
I'm really an alien from outer space.

26:03.615 --> 26:05.448
- I came here to learn your ways.
- F... you, Maddie.

26:07.117 --> 26:09.552
<i>Don't try to know me, Ezra.</i>

26:09.554 --> 26:11.254
I'm not worth it.

26:21.266 --> 26:24.367
If it's all just make-believe,

26:24.369 --> 26:26.936
then why'd you keep this?

26:26.938 --> 26:28.538
Why would you keep a stupid anklet

26:28.540 --> 26:30.573
if it didn't mean something?

26:34.079 --> 26:37.480
It did mean something.
That's why I kept it.

26:37.482 --> 26:39.549
And then I met someone new,

26:39.551 --> 26:41.317
<i>and he took it off,</i>

26:41.319 --> 26:43.720
and that meant something too.

27:04.924 --> 27:07.377
So yeah, that's me right there.

27:07.640 --> 27:09.746
Uh, thanks for lunch

27:10.095 --> 27:12.276
and, uh, asking
some interesting questions.

27:12.276 --> 27:13.182
That was fun.

27:13.184 --> 27:14.384
Yeah.

27:16.288 --> 27:18.187
Um...

27:18.189 --> 27:19.922
well... Do...

27:19.924 --> 27:23.626
Would... would you like to see,
uh, the piece I'm making?

27:26.898 --> 27:30.600
Yeah... this is it...

27:30.602 --> 27:32.568
- Where the...
- Magic happens.

27:34.372 --> 27:36.606
Art... Magic.

27:46.618 --> 27:48.584
- Sorry, no, I have to stop.
- Okay, okay...

27:48.586 --> 27:51.354
I really... rea...
- Mm-hmm.

27:51.356 --> 27:52.722
I shouldn't do that.

28:11.033 --> 28:12.298
Sorry, I shouldn't do that.

28:12.298 --> 28:14.110
- Totally, totally.
- Patrick is going to kill me.

28:14.112 --> 28:15.678
- Ezra would kill me.
- You have a f... ing...

28:15.680 --> 28:17.680
You have a boyfriend.
This is a bad idea.

28:17.682 --> 28:19.182
Yes, it is.

28:20.647 --> 28:21.951
This is complicated.

28:22.249 --> 28:23.492
Wow.

28:25.390 --> 28:28.458
Or maybe...

28:28.460 --> 28:30.727
not complicated.

28:36.130 --> 28:38.534
Would I sound totally immature

28:38.536 --> 28:41.070
if I said...

28:41.072 --> 28:43.873
I won't tell if you won't?

28:44.888 --> 28:46.642
At this moment, it sounds like
the most mature f... ing thing

28:46.644 --> 28:48.111
I've ever heard.

29:10.168 --> 29:13.269
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- You were right.

29:13.271 --> 29:14.737
<i>I don't think we can trust Ezra.</i>

29:14.739 --> 29:16.111
I told you that.

29:16.554 --> 29:17.797
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

29:18.009 --> 29:20.710
He could actually
screw this whole thing.

29:20.712 --> 29:22.044
He's acting all jumpy and...

29:22.046 --> 29:24.580
Listen to me, it doesn't matter.

29:24.582 --> 29:27.350
I talked to the Doctor today.
He's coming.

29:27.352 --> 29:28.918
<i>He's gonna be at the
wedding to get his money.</i>

29:28.920 --> 29:31.454
<i>We just to have to make sure it happens.</i>

29:31.456 --> 29:33.589
- I'm scared.
- Well, don't be.

29:33.591 --> 29:35.925
Once the Doctor grabs that money,

29:35.927 --> 29:37.760
we're home free.

29:37.762 --> 29:39.395
Okay.

29:39.397 --> 29:41.731
What are we gonna do about Ezra?

29:41.733 --> 29:44.801
<i>What you've always done...
Manage him, then ditch him.</i>

29:44.803 --> 29:46.903
<i>The FBI can have him.
I don't... whatever.</i>

29:46.905 --> 29:48.704
<i>Good.</i>

29:48.706 --> 29:51.407
<i>Time to put him behind me.</i>

29:51.409 --> 29:53.342
<i>Yeah.</i>

29:55.580 --> 29:58.748
Sorry, brother, but as the man said,

29:58.750 --> 30:02.285
the truth shall set you free.

30:09.309 --> 30:11.683
_

30:23.023 --> 30:24.823
I still think this is ridiculous.

30:24.825 --> 30:26.892
A rehearsal dinner for a fake wedding?

30:26.894 --> 30:28.703
Well, the con is in the details.

30:28.703 --> 30:31.696
For all we know, the Doctor
has eyes on us right now.

30:31.698 --> 30:33.398
So he wants a wedding,

30:33.400 --> 30:34.675
let's give him a wedding.

30:34.966 --> 30:36.568
So where'd you find the minister?

30:36.994 --> 30:39.669
- Is he with the Bureau?
- Uh, no, not exactly.

30:39.669 --> 30:42.598
He's with the Anglicans. He's real.

30:42.600 --> 30:44.193
Oh, Lord.

30:45.325 --> 30:46.068
Can you believe all this meat?

30:46.070 --> 30:47.903
Hmm, yeah, great.

30:47.905 --> 30:50.205
You must be... don't tell me...

30:50.207 --> 30:52.775
the bride's brother. Is that right?

30:52.777 --> 30:54.857
- Yeah.
- That is so great...

30:55.317 --> 30:57.880
that you can be here
for her to support her

30:57.882 --> 30:59.248
on her special day.

30:59.250 --> 31:01.396
Yeah, she's had a lot of special days.

31:02.453 --> 31:03.852
Hey there, Jules.

31:03.854 --> 31:07.589
Oh, hey, yourself. Hi.

31:07.805 --> 31:09.058
Have you met my auntie?

31:09.060 --> 31:10.815
No, I don't think I have.

31:10.815 --> 31:12.360
Uh, Auntie, this is Jules.

31:12.360 --> 31:14.430
This is, uh,
Saffron's brother's girlfriend.

31:14.432 --> 31:15.611
- Hello.
- Hello.

31:15.611 --> 31:19.068
- Isn't Jules a boy's name?
- It's short for Julia.

31:19.070 --> 31:20.936
Julia's pretty short as is.

31:20.938 --> 31:21.778
Okay, Auntie,

31:21.778 --> 31:24.606
why don't we go on ahead
and get you something to eat.

31:24.608 --> 31:27.242
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you... you too.

31:28.310 --> 31:30.879
I like to keep my sermons personal...

31:30.881 --> 31:33.082
so I was hoping to get

31:33.084 --> 31:37.152
just a teeny tiny bit of
background on your story.

31:37.154 --> 31:39.154
You know, when you met, how you met,

31:39.156 --> 31:42.891
when that light bulb went off,
and you finally knew.

31:44.662 --> 31:46.832
Oh, don't everybody talk at once.

31:47.765 --> 31:49.164
All right, I'll start. Um...

31:49.166 --> 31:51.500
No, I'll tell it.

31:51.502 --> 31:53.502
Okay, this is good.

31:53.504 --> 31:56.297
Well, I met Patrick
randomly in a coffee shop.

31:56.297 --> 31:58.273
- That was Seattle, right?
- Right.

31:58.590 --> 32:02.177
But I found out later that
it wasn't random at all.

32:02.538 --> 32:05.354
He was actually stalking me for awhile,

32:05.354 --> 32:08.751
- waiting to lure me in.
- Okay.

32:09.344 --> 32:11.103
- She's kidding, of course.
- Oh...

32:12.072 --> 32:13.169
Well...

32:13.582 --> 32:16.640
The real story is that
I had heard about her

32:16.640 --> 32:18.260
through mutual acquaintances,

32:18.262 --> 32:20.817
so I arranged to bump into her.

32:21.599 --> 32:24.967
And she turned out to be even more...

32:24.969 --> 32:27.770
unreal than I could even imagine.

32:27.772 --> 32:28.838
Mm.

32:28.840 --> 32:31.073
Oh, gosh, that's just...

32:31.075 --> 32:32.526
So you two were set up?

32:32.810 --> 32:34.610
Well, at least one of us was.

32:34.612 --> 32:36.579
Excuse me.

32:39.183 --> 32:42.351
Weddings can be very stressful.

32:42.353 --> 32:45.955
Three, two, one, go.

32:46.531 --> 32:48.524
One Mississippi,

32:48.526 --> 32:52.294
two Mississippi, three Mississippi,

32:52.296 --> 32:54.530
four Mississippi,

32:54.532 --> 32:56.031
five Mississippi.

32:56.033 --> 32:57.399
- Not bad.
- Thank you.

32:57.401 --> 32:58.868
Get it down to three,
and you're good to go.

32:58.870 --> 33:00.236
I mean, if you'd count for me,

33:00.238 --> 33:02.738
I can focus my energies on...

33:02.740 --> 33:04.807
It's Maddie. You mind if I take this?

33:04.809 --> 33:06.458
Eh, sure, we'll set it up again

33:06.458 --> 33:09.111
when you're done with your call.
I'm gonna rack out.

33:09.631 --> 33:10.379
Hey.

33:10.613 --> 33:12.114
What's the problem, Richard?

33:12.116 --> 33:14.750
<i>Nah, it's all good. Everything's great.</i>

33:14.752 --> 33:16.552
You called me six times.

33:16.554 --> 33:17.753
Yeah, I, uh...

33:17.755 --> 33:20.890
I just wanted to say
that you were right.

33:20.892 --> 33:22.758
Um, I thought about
what you said earlier...

33:22.760 --> 33:24.460
about me not being in love with you

33:24.462 --> 33:25.961
and being in love with who I was

33:25.963 --> 33:27.596
<i>when I was with you.</i>

33:27.598 --> 33:28.764
<i>And I talked it out with Max.</i>

33:28.766 --> 33:30.966
You talked it out with Max?

33:31.343 --> 33:32.468
Yeah.

33:32.470 --> 33:34.670
Yeah, Max and I are homies.

33:34.672 --> 33:38.841
Uh, he helped me put some
things in perspective.

33:38.843 --> 33:41.610
I can still be the man that I wanna be

33:41.612 --> 33:43.846
without Alice.

33:43.848 --> 33:47.583
Yeah, well, that's great, Richie.

33:47.585 --> 33:49.218
<i>I'm glad to hear it.</i>

33:49.795 --> 33:52.521
Max is... He's good with this shit, man,

33:52.523 --> 33:54.690
'cause it's from experience, you know?

33:54.692 --> 33:56.859
He was telling me this story about

33:56.861 --> 33:58.294
this chick he was in love with,

33:58.296 --> 34:00.396
and, I mean, the same sort of thing.

34:00.398 --> 34:02.698
<i>Some shit went down,
she betrayed him or something</i>

34:02.700 --> 34:04.633
<i>and he found her at,
like, a train station,</i>

34:04.635 --> 34:07.803
<i>about to leave town,
but he had to give her up.</i>

34:11.742 --> 34:12.775
He said what?

34:12.777 --> 34:14.310
Yeah, I mean, I don't know the details,

34:14.312 --> 34:17.079
but it sounded really intense.

34:17.081 --> 34:18.746
<i>But that's what I have to do, right?</i>

34:18.748 --> 34:21.884
<i>I mean, I have to give it up.</i>

34:21.886 --> 34:26.655
<i>But hey, without pain,
there's no wisdom.</i>

34:26.657 --> 34:29.725
- Yeah, I gotta go.
<i>- Yeah, talk to you later.</i>

34:50.547 --> 34:52.147
This whole thing's pretty weird, right?

34:52.149 --> 34:54.282
What? Nothing.

34:54.284 --> 34:57.318
- You okay?
- Yeah... no, uh, it is weird.

34:57.320 --> 35:00.355
You know, in Old English,
weird used to mean destiny.

35:00.357 --> 35:01.523
I did a paper once on "Beowulf."

35:01.525 --> 35:04.692
You think this is, like, our destiny?

35:04.694 --> 35:07.195
Okay, seriously,
you wanna tell me what's up?

35:12.069 --> 35:15.570
I slept with Gina.

35:15.572 --> 35:17.739
- You what?
- Last night.

35:17.741 --> 35:18.976
Don't look.

35:20.310 --> 35:22.877
You slept with Gina?

35:22.879 --> 35:24.379
Oh, God,

35:24.381 --> 35:26.014
I slept with the woman

35:26.016 --> 35:27.682
who I know isn't who
she really says she is.

35:27.684 --> 35:28.639
Is this, like, a pattern?

35:28.639 --> 35:29.863
Is there something wrong with me?

35:29.863 --> 35:31.386
Yeah, tha... that's pretty f... ed up.

35:33.323 --> 35:35.824
How... how was it?

35:35.826 --> 35:38.493
Amazing.

35:38.987 --> 35:42.097
You bedded an undercover agent.

35:42.099 --> 35:43.061
Damn, girl.

35:43.061 --> 35:45.020
I guess I can cross that
off the bucket list, huh?

35:45.020 --> 35:46.583
I mean, come on, at least
somebody besides Richard's

35:46.583 --> 35:48.975
getting some action around here, right?

35:50.640 --> 35:53.007
You're a really understanding boyfriend.

35:53.009 --> 35:54.709
You know that?

36:17.922 --> 36:20.201
I'm gonna miss that view.

36:20.203 --> 36:22.070
Me too.

36:36.553 --> 36:39.921
Never could sleep the night
before one of my weddings.

36:42.789 --> 36:44.789
Yeah, it's tough...

36:44.791 --> 36:47.192
the kinda work we do.

36:49.329 --> 36:54.099
You don't actually believe
we do the same kinda work.

36:54.101 --> 36:56.001
No.

36:56.003 --> 36:58.203
No, I don't.

37:00.007 --> 37:02.665
I still have this fantasy...

37:04.711 --> 37:06.786
that I'll meet somebody...

37:08.181 --> 37:10.498
who will love me, even though...

37:11.718 --> 37:14.119
they'll find out who I really am.

37:16.924 --> 37:18.657
It's good to have fantasies.

37:20.928 --> 37:23.561
Sometimes, they even end up coming true.

37:27.200 --> 37:29.734
That's not how it works.

37:29.736 --> 37:33.538
Nobody waves a wand.

37:33.540 --> 37:37.542
Moments present themselves,
and then you either...

37:37.544 --> 37:40.245
make it happen, or you don't.

37:50.023 --> 37:53.391
Maddie...

37:53.393 --> 37:54.971
why don't you stay tonight?

37:56.997 --> 37:58.830
For old time's sake.

38:04.104 --> 38:05.635
That's bad luck.

38:37.604 --> 38:39.070
Here... right here.

38:39.072 --> 38:41.039
- Right here?
- Right here.

38:41.041 --> 38:42.715
- You sure?
- Yeah.

38:44.711 --> 38:46.451
Keep the change.

39:11.271 --> 39:13.271
You must be Maddie Jonson...

39:13.273 --> 39:15.874
femme fatale.

39:15.876 --> 39:19.944
You must be Ezra Bloom, FBI informant.

39:19.946 --> 39:23.715
As far as the FBI knows,
you're goddamn right.

39:23.717 --> 39:26.384
- You were great.
- I was, wasn't I?

39:26.386 --> 39:28.686
Yeah, but that whole anklet...

39:28.688 --> 39:31.589
"tell me who you really are"
thing was a bit much, pal.

39:31.591 --> 39:34.692
Well, you said to make it look real.

39:43.617 --> 39:44.653
<i>Hello, Doctor.</i>

39:44.653 --> 39:47.472
Here we go, Max. Are we ready?

39:47.474 --> 39:50.608
Yes, Doctor, everything is on track.

39:50.610 --> 39:52.310
Maddie marries the mark tomorrow,

39:52.312 --> 39:56.081
and after that,
we'll follow our usual schedule.

39:56.083 --> 39:59.484
<i>Good. This is the big one, Max.</i>

39:59.486 --> 40:03.388
<i>After the Heller fiasco,
we have some ground to make up.</i>

40:03.390 --> 40:05.023
<i>That seems doable, doesn't it?</i>

40:05.876 --> 40:08.543
<i>Well, Patrick Campbell's
numbers are excellent.</i>

40:08.545 --> 40:10.879
Don't worry. It's only bait.

40:10.881 --> 40:12.814
<i>We should all do very well.</i>

40:12.816 --> 40:16.484
<i>This will be the biggest
single score we've ever had.</i>

40:16.486 --> 40:18.153
<i>And how 'bout Maddie?</i>

40:18.155 --> 40:20.856
I take it Lenny Cohen's
visit got her back in line?

40:20.858 --> 40:22.891
<i>Oh, yes, Maddie's back to her old self.</i>

40:22.893 --> 40:25.193
<i>Nothing to worry about there.</i>

40:25.195 --> 40:27.195
<i>We're all having fun again.</i>

40:27.197 --> 40:29.764
All right, everyone,
tomorrow's the big day.

40:29.766 --> 40:31.900
Game time. Agent Simons.

40:31.902 --> 40:33.702
Okay, everyone should know their jobs.

40:33.704 --> 40:35.604
Let's go over it one more time,
just in case.

40:35.606 --> 40:37.105
Agent Anderson will be running...

40:37.105 --> 40:40.342
And personally, I'm really
looking forward to tomorrow.

40:40.344 --> 40:42.711
Well, I'm pleased to hear that
everything's back on track.

40:42.713 --> 40:45.113
I'm promised you that I would
take care of it, Doctor,

40:45.115 --> 40:46.715
<i>and I did.</i>

40:46.717 --> 40:48.516
Hell, I would never let you down.

40:48.518 --> 40:49.538
We hit some snags,

40:49.538 --> 40:51.152
<i>but everything's going very well now.</i>

40:51.154 --> 40:52.954
This isn't over yet, Max.

40:52.956 --> 40:55.123
I need you to keep up the good work.

40:55.125 --> 40:58.827
Oh, of course, Doctor.
I'm your eyes and ears.

40:58.829 --> 41:00.198
Bye now.

41:01.999 --> 41:05.967
Ladies and gentlemen...

41:05.969 --> 41:08.403
the Doctor is in.

41:08.405 --> 41:09.264
12:00?

41:09.264 --> 41:11.339
I deliver the art
piece to the gift room.

41:11.341 --> 41:13.008
Good. 12:15?

41:13.010 --> 41:15.410
I make sure Max's car
has a clear path out.

41:15.412 --> 41:16.333
12:20?

41:16.333 --> 41:18.680
I seat Max... I mean... the Doctor

41:18.682 --> 41:20.548
where Patrick has a clear view of him.

41:20.550 --> 41:21.530
12:25?

41:21.530 --> 41:23.351
The wedding starts, the song plays.

41:23.353 --> 41:25.153
<i>I hear the song, I start car number one,</i>

41:25.155 --> 41:26.388
<i>- and boom.
- Good.</i>

41:26.390 --> 41:27.856
<i>Again. 12:00?</i>

41:27.858 --> 41:30.892
<i>- I deliver the art piece.
- 12:15.</i>

41:30.894 --> 41:33.495
<i>Make sure Max's car
has a clear path out.</i>

41:33.497 --> 41:34.721
<i>12:20.</i>

41:35.305 --> 41:41.942
