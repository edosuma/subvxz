WEBVTT

00:20.311 --> 00:21.521
Fuck! We're gone a few days

00:21.646 --> 00:24.315
and the Snyderverse people
took over.

00:24.399 --> 00:26.526
Yeah! Screw the patriarchy!

00:26.651 --> 00:27.986
And this car!

00:28.069 --> 00:30.280
-Nora?
-Wait, Ivy?

00:30.363 --> 00:32.490
[gasps] Oh, my God!
Where have you been?

00:32.573 --> 00:33.658
Oh. Hey, Harley.

00:35.243 --> 00:40.081
[singing in Italian]

00:40.165 --> 00:42.584
Okay. What the fuck
is going on?

00:42.667 --> 00:45.837
Nice of you two hos to finally
join us for the apocalypse.

00:45.962 --> 00:47.672
Wait? It's already happened.

00:47.797 --> 00:50.175
Oh! We'll just go back
in the time-sphere
and go back a week.

00:51.259 --> 00:52.302
[both gasp]

00:53.845 --> 00:55.847
[theme music playing]

00:57.849 --> 00:59.434
[accordion music playing]

01:04.938 --> 01:07.317
[grumbling]

01:10.403 --> 01:14.824
Hey! Pasta-maker makers beware.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.869
I have arrived!

01:17.952 --> 01:22.082
Receptionisto!
I was on hold with you
for 94 hours

01:22.164 --> 01:24.501
and after realizing
that seemed futile,

01:24.584 --> 01:27.879
I came to speak with you
mano-a-mano.

01:27.962 --> 01:30.215
[In Italian accent] Do you have
an appointimento?

01:30.298 --> 01:32.592
No, I do not have appointmento.

01:32.717 --> 01:36.012
I was stuck
in Homeland Security
for months.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.181
Then in customs,
also for months.

01:38.264 --> 01:41.726
Then my mask tubes
got tangled
in your olive branches

01:41.851 --> 01:44.145
for uncountable hours.
[groans softly]

01:44.229 --> 01:49.609
And now I will finally
complete my quest to win
my coworker's affections

01:49.734 --> 01:53.947
by fixing the handle
of her boss' pasta maker.

01:54.072 --> 01:55.824
That handle is discontinuato.

01:55.907 --> 01:59.911
Discontinued! Unacceptable!
[sighs wearily]

01:59.994 --> 02:01.538
What about in the back?

02:01.621 --> 02:03.415
Sometimes a store
doesn't think
they have something.

02:03.498 --> 02:06.710
Then they check in the back
and they're like,
"Well, there it is."

02:06.793 --> 02:07.919
It is a-not in the back.

02:08.002 --> 02:09.294
You do not understand.

02:09.420 --> 02:12.590
My whole life,
I have existed in darkness,

02:12.716 --> 02:14.843
hopeless that I would
find someone

02:14.926 --> 02:18.930
who connects with me
on an emotional
and spiritual level.

02:19.014 --> 02:21.099
Well, I have found her...

02:21.224 --> 02:23.518
My lovely Nora.

02:23.601 --> 02:26.603
But if I don't find
a new handle
for this pasta maker,

02:26.688 --> 02:27.772
I will lose her.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.400
Discontinuato.

02:33.361 --> 02:35.488
Pasta pricks!

02:37.198 --> 02:38.575
[disco music playing]

02:38.658 --> 02:41.536
Marcos, you're the only
IRS auditor worth a damn!

02:41.619 --> 02:44.414
Good luck
with the promotion, buddy.
You deserve it.

02:47.375 --> 02:48.668
[belches] Ah!

02:48.752 --> 02:50.837
Take that, suckas.

02:50.962 --> 02:52.839
In other news,
Lex Luthor has announced

02:52.964 --> 02:56.134
he's about to start repairing
the ozone layer

02:56.216 --> 02:59.095
with the Earth Saver by Lex.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.972
Whenever you're ready,
Mr. Luthor.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.682
Jesus, Elvis,

03:02.807 --> 03:04.225
Rihanna's baby.

03:04.309 --> 03:06.895
And now, Lex Luthor.

03:06.978 --> 03:09.439
When the pages of history
look back on today...

03:09.522 --> 03:11.232
Oh! I'm too excited.

03:11.316 --> 03:12.359
Let's go.

03:13.068 --> 03:14.652
[laser whooshes]

03:21.117 --> 03:22.285
-What did you do?
-Sir,

03:22.369 --> 03:23.787
it appears our
maximum laser range

03:23.870 --> 03:26.373
is 304cm short
of the Earth's atmosphere.

03:26.498 --> 03:28.500
In English!

03:28.625 --> 03:30.710
It's about 10ft short, sir.

03:30.835 --> 03:31.670
[grunts]

03:31.753 --> 03:33.338
[screams]

03:37.966 --> 03:42.305
I will find you an even better
pasta maker handle.

03:42.389 --> 03:45.809
[speaking in Italian accent]
Excuzi me-zee, Italian man.

03:45.892 --> 03:50.021
Can you tell me
where I can find
the best pasta maker

03:50.105 --> 03:51.815
in all of Italy?

03:51.898 --> 03:52.732
[snoring]

03:55.360 --> 03:58.738
These people
and their fucking naps!

03:58.822 --> 04:00.365
-[thuds]
-[grunts]

04:02.534 --> 04:04.869
Hola, bambinos.

04:04.953 --> 04:07.956
It's a me, Bahn-io.

04:08.039 --> 04:11.501
[in Italian]

04:12.252 --> 04:13.837
[all laughing]

04:15.213 --> 04:16.714
Indeed.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.759
Where do I find
the best pasta maker
in all of Italy?

04:19.884 --> 04:21.386
Eh, pasta maker.

04:22.053 --> 04:24.180
Grazie, Mille!

04:24.264 --> 04:25.098
Huh?

04:25.223 --> 04:29.019
Damn you, street urchins!

04:29.102 --> 04:30.395
[Bane grunting]

04:30.478 --> 04:34.899
Every blister is worth it,
my sweet Nora!

04:35.567 --> 04:37.068
[sighing] Nora!

04:37.152 --> 04:38.653
Nora!

04:38.737 --> 04:40.905
-[Lenny] Nora. Nora.
-[Nora laughs mischievously]

04:41.031 --> 04:42.741
Hmm.

04:42.824 --> 04:46.077
It's so much hotter
when someone's sleeping
in the same room.

04:46.161 --> 04:47.620
How is she even comfortable?

04:47.746 --> 04:49.873
Did someone say comfortable?

04:49.956 --> 04:53.335
Ooh. Can't wait to get
my tongue stuck to that.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.337
[both moan]

04:55.420 --> 04:58.715
Actually, before we
get into it,
I need a bowl of pasta.

04:58.798 --> 04:59.799
BRB.

04:59.924 --> 05:02.177
[sputtering] Oh, yeah.
Yeah, me too.

05:02.260 --> 05:03.720
It's always been
a dream of mine

05:03.803 --> 05:06.431
to simultaneously explode
all the volcanoes on Earth.

05:06.514 --> 05:08.141
Ivy's going to be so proud.

05:08.266 --> 05:09.267
She recommended you.

05:09.351 --> 05:11.102
What the fuck is going on here?

05:11.227 --> 05:12.520
I was asked to help Lex with--

05:12.604 --> 05:14.064
Can it, lava lips!

05:14.147 --> 05:15.440
I wanna hear it from him.

05:15.565 --> 05:18.651
Oh, I'm just borrowing
a low-level employee

05:18.777 --> 05:20.862
to activate some volcanoes
around the world,

05:20.945 --> 05:23.656
creating enough heat
to raise the ozone up...

05:23.782 --> 05:25.658
Oh, I don't know,
ten-ish feet.

05:25.784 --> 05:26.785
It doesn't matter why.

05:26.910 --> 05:28.620
Seems like it does matter why.

05:28.703 --> 05:30.538
This doesn't concern you, Nora.

05:30.622 --> 05:34.459
Oh? A nefarious
business tycoon, comes
into the office on a Sunday

05:34.542 --> 05:36.336
to take a
wet-behind-the-ears rube,

05:36.461 --> 05:37.879
to help with
a personal project.

05:37.962 --> 05:40.340
All my alarm bells
are going off, buster!

05:40.465 --> 05:42.092
Oh, no! Am I in trouble?

05:42.175 --> 05:43.134
I thought Ivy knew.

05:43.259 --> 05:44.594
Is she gonna be mad at me or--

05:44.678 --> 05:46.304
Why are you even here
on a Sunday?

05:46.429 --> 05:48.014
I always work weekends.

05:48.139 --> 05:51.643
Ugh! Go back to your nerd hole.
And put your headphones on.

05:51.726 --> 05:53.978
It's about to get nasty
in here.

05:54.104 --> 05:55.313
Not so fast!

05:55.397 --> 05:56.731
Explain yourself.

05:56.815 --> 05:58.733
I thought that she was
doing that press tour

05:58.817 --> 06:00.985
for her line
of business corsets
with the Jons.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.904
Ivy's not working
with the Jons anymore.

06:02.987 --> 06:05.365
She blew them to smithereens,
you slippery son of a--

06:05.490 --> 06:06.366
She did what?

06:06.491 --> 06:07.826
God, you men!

06:07.909 --> 06:09.661
You drain our titties
when you're baby boys

06:09.786 --> 06:11.830
and now you're making us
run your companies?

06:11.913 --> 06:12.956
Get out!

06:13.540 --> 06:14.582
[grunting]

06:16.626 --> 06:18.086
Knock, knock.

06:20.463 --> 06:22.132
Hello?

06:22.215 --> 06:23.800
[suspenseful music playing]

06:26.052 --> 06:27.429
Um, mi scusi?

06:27.512 --> 06:28.346
[groans]

06:28.471 --> 06:30.974
Who stabs my weary heart?

06:33.476 --> 06:34.352
[speaking Italian]

06:34.477 --> 06:36.855
Apologies, Signora.

06:36.938 --> 06:40.316
I wandered onto your property
on my botched search

06:40.400 --> 06:43.862
for the best pasta maker
in all of Italy.

06:43.987 --> 06:46.906
[speaking in Italian accent]
You have found her, beefy man.

06:47.032 --> 06:49.159
A-ha!

06:49.242 --> 06:53.163
Ivy, you'll never guess
what that twat Lex tried to do.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.414
Okay, seriously, wake up.

06:54.539 --> 06:55.665
Do you have toxic shock?

06:55.749 --> 06:57.584
You've been sleeping
for, like, days.

06:57.709 --> 06:59.753
-You're not Ivy!
-[groans]

06:59.878 --> 07:01.421
Enough with
the wig shenanigans.

07:01.546 --> 07:03.381
Ivy's not even there.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.383
All right, Lexinators,
move in.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.552
Aren't you worried
about Ivy?

07:07.635 --> 07:08.803
No one's heard from her.

07:08.887 --> 07:10.347
Yeah, feels like
a Monday problem.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.681
Now, where were we?

07:13.475 --> 07:15.101
-[both gasp]
-Duck!

07:17.062 --> 07:18.355
Volcana, you perv!

07:18.438 --> 07:20.106
What are you doing?

07:20.231 --> 07:22.942
Recharging in the comfort
of Ivy's random hairs
and chip crumbs?

07:23.068 --> 07:24.486
[guns cocking]

07:24.569 --> 07:26.071
[Nora groans]

07:26.196 --> 07:27.906
[Volcana] Unhand me!

07:28.031 --> 07:30.617
Did someone change
the WiFi password?

07:33.036 --> 07:33.912
[groaning]

07:36.289 --> 07:37.624
-Ice!
-Fire!

07:39.876 --> 07:41.252
[groans]

07:41.378 --> 07:43.963
I thought I was
the only sucker
working on a Sunday.

07:44.089 --> 07:45.882
No one has work-life
boundaries anymore.

07:45.965 --> 07:48.677
We're being trolled
by a petty-ass bald himbo

07:48.760 --> 07:50.512
who's trying to keep me
from getting laid!

07:50.595 --> 07:52.514
Girl, you are messy.

07:52.597 --> 07:53.598
Come on, Lenny.

07:53.682 --> 07:55.808
Let's continue this in my car.

08:02.774 --> 08:04.401
-[belches]
-Ew!

08:04.484 --> 08:06.194
Grazie, Signora.

08:06.277 --> 08:10.573
I will never forget
your act of
international kindness.

08:11.282 --> 08:12.242
No freeloading.

08:12.325 --> 08:13.785
You eat my parmesan,

08:13.868 --> 08:15.328
you help in the kitchen, huh?

08:15.453 --> 08:16.579
[whining] I need rest!

08:16.663 --> 08:19.416
I'm afraid my body
will fail me!

08:19.499 --> 08:22.127
Now is not the time for fear.

08:22.252 --> 08:24.421
Fear comes-ah later.

08:24.504 --> 08:25.797
After dessert?

08:25.922 --> 08:28.299
Silencio! I ask the questions.

08:28.383 --> 08:31.261
-You make-a the dough
or out you get-a.
-[groans]

08:33.221 --> 08:35.682
Shit, shit, shit!
What the shit
are we gonna do?

08:35.807 --> 08:37.976
Can't you use your powers
to explode us out of here?

08:38.058 --> 08:40.895
I'm famously known for fires,
not explosions.

08:40.979 --> 08:43.148
It's a subtle but very
important distinction.

08:43.231 --> 08:44.941
[Lex on intercom]
Ivy's underlings,

08:45.025 --> 08:46.651
you have one last chance
to hand over Volcana.

08:46.776 --> 08:48.403
I wish Ivy were here.

08:48.486 --> 08:49.779
Well, she's not!

08:49.863 --> 08:52.073
And the line of succession
I just decided on

08:52.157 --> 08:53.324
says I'm in charge.

08:53.450 --> 08:55.452
[Lex] Nora,

08:55.535 --> 08:57.704
I take your silence
as a refusal to hand over
the fire breather?

08:57.829 --> 08:59.330
Uh-huh. That's right.

08:59.414 --> 09:01.833
I've seen men like you
take young, nerdy women before.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.168
Well, not on my watch!

09:03.251 --> 09:04.419
Aw! Thank you, Nora.

09:04.502 --> 09:06.212
Will someone put her
in the panic room already!

09:06.338 --> 09:08.214
The LOD doesn't have
a panic room.

09:08.340 --> 09:11.134
God, I can't deal
with all these personalities.

09:11.217 --> 09:12.510
Don't worry, work fam.

09:12.635 --> 09:14.637
Time for this shark to shine.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.848
I'm gonna hack us out of here.

09:16.931 --> 09:19.100
[exhilarating music playing]

09:20.268 --> 09:21.978
Can you get into
Ivy's bank account?

09:22.062 --> 09:23.521
I wanna know
what that bitch makes.

09:23.646 --> 09:26.316
Quick. Someone get me something
with taurine in it.

09:28.151 --> 09:30.236
I would not call it
love at first sight.

09:30.362 --> 09:34.199
What I have with Nora
is much deeper.

09:34.282 --> 09:37.285
Hey! We work with the hands,
not the mouth.

09:38.995 --> 09:40.789
You are being
quite rough with me.

09:40.872 --> 09:44.376
Oh! It is passion! It is life!

09:44.501 --> 09:46.002
-Ow.
-Now, focus.

09:49.923 --> 09:53.343
Okay, little egg. Crack!

09:53.426 --> 09:54.260
[Bane grumbles]

09:57.889 --> 10:01.059
Your eggs are faulty!
I will 'splode them all!

10:01.142 --> 10:02.268
Argh!

10:02.394 --> 10:03.728
[hen clucks]

10:03.853 --> 10:06.731
Give to me a photo
of your beloved.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.236
Now you try.

10:11.319 --> 10:13.947
[groans softly] Okay.
But I will assuredly break her

10:14.072 --> 10:17.742
like I have so many bodies
and spirits in my career.

10:17.867 --> 10:21.621
Not if you break it for her.

10:30.672 --> 10:32.632
[exclaims]

10:38.221 --> 10:41.766
Think of this dough
as like a bosoms
of your Nora.

10:41.891 --> 10:44.644
[chuckles nervously] Oh, my.

10:46.604 --> 10:48.064
Uh, like... like this?

10:48.148 --> 10:49.107
Perfecto.

10:49.232 --> 10:51.526
Um, don't forget to play
with the nipples.

10:51.609 --> 10:53.903
[chuckles softly] Oh, well.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.156
Again. You must
do it yourself.

10:56.281 --> 10:58.992
In my kitchen,
there is no rope!

10:59.659 --> 11:00.994
[sighs wearily]

11:15.633 --> 11:16.634
I can't!

11:16.718 --> 11:19.346
You can! Look at our hands.

11:19.471 --> 11:21.014
They are not so different.

11:21.139 --> 11:24.142
Yes, each of yours is like
five little sausage,

11:24.267 --> 11:26.728
stuck to a fresh ball
of mozzerella.

11:26.811 --> 11:29.689
But they can still do
delicate work.

11:29.814 --> 11:32.942
Hmm. Assembling my bombs
for 'splosions

11:33.026 --> 11:36.488
has always required
a nimble touch, I suppose.

11:36.613 --> 11:37.697
Yes!

11:37.822 --> 11:39.240
Think of each fettuccine

11:39.324 --> 11:42.660
as a, um,
'splosive of feelings
for your Nora.

11:42.744 --> 11:44.204
Now, cut.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.375
[Bane grunting]

11:48.500 --> 11:50.335
Too thick! Again!

12:01.763 --> 12:06.059
Nora! Nora! Nora! Nora!

12:08.561 --> 12:10.063
[slurping]

12:10.188 --> 12:12.148
[groaning] My dick's
gonna fall off
waiting for you.

12:12.232 --> 12:16.111
Look, I took this job hoping
there'd be way more
villainous IT emergencies,

12:16.194 --> 12:18.863
not just helping folks
do their timecard online.

12:18.988 --> 12:21.116
Finally, this is my moment!

12:21.199 --> 12:23.076
This is fascinating
watching you.

12:23.201 --> 12:26.204
Hey! That's supposed to be
my sensual neck massage!

12:26.329 --> 12:30.125
I'm trying to keep
my guy loose.
And I'm learning so much.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.086
[mimicking gunshots]

12:33.211 --> 12:37.007
I can't die watching
two men bond over tech.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.842
Of course! The Imbigulator!

12:38.925 --> 12:40.552
We can use this
to make the building bigger

12:40.635 --> 12:41.761
and the armor will pop off.

12:41.886 --> 12:44.222
No! Nora, I need this.

12:44.305 --> 12:47.392
-It's my time to prove
I'm more than just a dad.
-[laptop chimes]

12:47.517 --> 12:49.728
And... ooh, la, la!

12:49.811 --> 12:52.188
I just got through
another firewall.

12:52.272 --> 12:55.525
A few more minutes
and we are good, to--

12:56.609 --> 12:59.237
Oh! I've been Imbigulated!

12:59.362 --> 13:02.615
-I can't hack like this!
-Ah, crap. It's single use.

13:02.741 --> 13:04.159
[rooster crows]

13:11.249 --> 13:12.334
Wake up!

13:12.417 --> 13:14.252
Time for mangia!

13:14.336 --> 13:16.046
Oh, I love pasta.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.423
Meele gratzis, Signora.

13:18.548 --> 13:19.674
No! Not Signora.

13:19.758 --> 13:22.802
You call me Mama.
Mama Nacaroni.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.679
Like Mama... Macaroni?

13:24.763 --> 13:28.433
Yes, my cousin's ristorante.

13:28.558 --> 13:31.061
Our name is-a Nacaroni.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.229
But they changed it
at Ellis Island.

13:35.231 --> 13:38.568
This is the most delicious
pasta I have ever had.

13:38.651 --> 13:39.778
Who made this?

13:39.861 --> 13:40.695
You did.

13:40.779 --> 13:42.655
What? When?

13:42.781 --> 13:49.287
Il buffone , you are the
second greatest pasta maker
in all of Italy.

13:49.371 --> 13:52.374
I am the pasta maker?

13:52.457 --> 13:55.168
Mama, I may have been
born in a prison,

13:55.251 --> 13:58.254
but I have been living
in a prison of my own
making,

13:58.338 --> 14:00.590
the warden,
my self-doubt.

14:00.674 --> 14:04.969
I have become the thing
that I sought!

14:05.095 --> 14:07.389
Thank you, Mama.

14:12.602 --> 14:13.978
[King Shark]
Will you look at these mitts?

14:14.104 --> 14:15.814
How am I gonna to drive home?

14:15.897 --> 14:17.315
Oh, fuck!

14:17.399 --> 14:19.651
My babysitter must be
in triple overtime by now.

14:19.776 --> 14:23.279
How many times have I asked you
not to mention children
in my presence?

14:23.363 --> 14:24.948
[Lex] Enough with your
female antics!

14:25.031 --> 14:28.076
It's time to...
turn up the heat.

14:28.785 --> 14:30.412
[whooshes]

14:30.495 --> 14:33.248
He said it like a pun,
but that's what he
literally did.

14:33.331 --> 14:35.250
How embarrassing!
[chuckles softly]

14:35.333 --> 14:37.168
[Lex] And I didn't mean
it as a pun.

14:37.293 --> 14:39.170
It's a double entendre,
if anything!
But that's irrelevant

14:39.295 --> 14:40.672
because I meant the turn on
the poison vapor.

14:40.797 --> 14:42.257
[yelling] Where the fuck
is the poison vapor?

14:42.340 --> 14:43.675
No, it's not in my car.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.260
I thought it was in your car.

14:45.343 --> 14:46.845
Well, go and get it!

14:46.928 --> 14:48.680
Ugh! My pits are gushing.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.265
I'll cool you down, baby.

14:50.348 --> 14:52.726
Heat is my most
despised nemesis.

14:52.851 --> 14:53.893
Ooh, yes. Ooh!

14:54.019 --> 14:55.895
Do my elbows.
[moans]

14:56.688 --> 14:57.981
[both moaning]

14:58.064 --> 14:59.983
[exclaiming] Get me
out of here!

15:00.066 --> 15:02.444
-[vapor whooshes]
-[Lex] Ah! There we go.

15:02.527 --> 15:04.362
-You! Cover that vent.
-No can do.

15:04.446 --> 15:06.156
It's too high up.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.742
Why can't any of you just,
like, get big and tall
and be impervious to gas?

15:08.867 --> 15:10.869
Can you at least
create an explosion
to get us out of here?

15:10.994 --> 15:12.954
I can make you an iced coffee?

15:13.038 --> 15:15.665
[groans softly] God!
Where's that 'splosions guy
when you need a 'splosion?

15:15.749 --> 15:17.083
You mean Bane?

15:17.208 --> 15:18.543
Oh, now I'm supposed to learn
everyone's names?

15:18.668 --> 15:19.586
[scoffs] Okay.

15:22.005 --> 15:23.923
[Bane humming]

15:24.049 --> 15:28.261
Do you think you could part
with a wedge of parm
for my trip home, Mama?

15:28.386 --> 15:29.012
Home?

15:29.095 --> 15:30.847
Si, Mama.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.725
I now return to Gotham
with all the secrets and wisdom
I learned

15:33.850 --> 15:37.395
in our short, but meaningful
time together.

15:38.563 --> 15:39.731
Hairy vaderchy!

15:39.856 --> 15:41.441
-No.
-Huh?

15:41.566 --> 15:45.153
Now, you will take over
my business
and be my heir.

15:45.236 --> 15:47.072
But Mama,
you fixed my problems,

15:47.197 --> 15:48.823
so I don't need you any--
[groans]

15:48.907 --> 15:52.077
Madre di puttana!
You cannot
come to this country,

15:52.160 --> 15:54.371
steal from us and then leave.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.581
You're a cultural tourist!
What now?

15:56.664 --> 15:59.918
You're gonna sell my story
to some asshole
at a streaming service.

16:00.001 --> 16:02.253
Mama, let's be reasonable.

16:02.337 --> 16:06.675
You think I would
teach you a craft I spent-a
my whole life perfecting

16:06.758 --> 16:08.426
and expect nothing in return?

16:08.551 --> 16:10.929
-[grunting]
-[suspenseful music playing]

16:11.012 --> 16:12.972
[groans softly]

16:13.098 --> 16:14.599
-[all coughing]
-[Nora] Okay,

16:14.683 --> 16:16.518
if we're gonna die
under my leadership,

16:16.601 --> 16:19.604
we're gonna do it looking
like fucking supermodels!

16:19.688 --> 16:22.232
This is where I stash
all the hair products,
diet snacks,

16:22.315 --> 16:24.401
and little pink guns
that brands send to Ivy

16:24.484 --> 16:25.777
hoping to get her endorsement.

16:25.860 --> 16:28.071
And it's also where I put
that volcano girl.

16:28.154 --> 16:29.531
[all exclaiming] Oh, fuck!

16:30.448 --> 16:32.909
Oh, thank, Mount Vesuvius!

16:32.992 --> 16:34.285
Why'd you lock me in here?

16:34.369 --> 16:36.037
I told you it wasn't
a panic room!

16:36.121 --> 16:37.622
You're alive, aren't you?

16:37.747 --> 16:38.665
Ooh, gas masks!

16:38.790 --> 16:39.749
Ooh, gum!

16:42.293 --> 16:46.214
[Volcana] This is literally
the most flammable closet
in all of Gotham.

16:46.297 --> 16:47.674
Hairspray, gunpowder,

16:47.799 --> 16:50.427
snacks made with
highly-combustible ingredients.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.762
I'm lucky I didn't explode!

16:52.846 --> 16:54.681
Explode, like an explosion?

16:54.806 --> 16:56.558
-Yes.
-Hmm.

16:58.685 --> 16:59.644
[Bane groaning]

17:03.565 --> 17:04.648
What? No!

17:04.773 --> 17:07.652
You will pay the price
for your insolence

17:07.736 --> 17:08.987
with death.

17:09.112 --> 17:12.323
Can't we sit and talk this out
over an aperitivo?

17:12.406 --> 17:14.992
Mama! Not my fingers!

17:15.076 --> 17:17.662
I need these
to pleasure Nora...

17:17.787 --> 17:19.414
with my calligraphy!

17:19.497 --> 17:23.792
And to continue working
as a semi-famous villain
in Gotham!

17:23.877 --> 17:26.588
Wait. You are semi-famous?

17:26.671 --> 17:28.923
Clayface? Hi.

17:29.007 --> 17:30.467
It's... It's me, Bane.

17:30.550 --> 17:33.845
No, Bane.
From 'sploding things?

17:33.928 --> 17:35.347
Yes!

17:35.430 --> 17:38.516
So, look. My former mentor
has me at knife point,

17:38.641 --> 17:42.437
and she's demanding tickets
to your Vegas show.

17:42.520 --> 17:45.732
-[softly] Front row.
-Front row, she says.

17:45.857 --> 17:47.025
Um...

17:47.150 --> 17:48.693
You want me
to head-butt Poison Ivy

17:48.777 --> 17:52.322
on the Gotham News live
just to embarrass her?

17:52.405 --> 17:54.449
But she's my Nora's boss...

17:55.283 --> 17:57.160
You've got a deal.

17:58.536 --> 18:00.497
Bravo, Il Buffone.

18:00.580 --> 18:01.498
Ugh!

18:07.379 --> 18:08.880
-Hairspray!
-Paint guns!

18:09.005 --> 18:10.757
[Nora] Diet snacks!

18:10.882 --> 18:13.551
I can carry so much stuff
with these big hands.

18:13.635 --> 18:16.388
Look! I'm holdin' like
20 diet sodas.

18:16.513 --> 18:18.306
Someone take a pic!

18:18.390 --> 18:19.849
Might as well throw this
in there.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.434
I don't know how to put it
back on the wall.

18:21.559 --> 18:23.687
Wow, this is just like
Die Hard.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.563
Oh, the over-referenced
action movie

18:25.647 --> 18:27.607
that's been parodied
into oblivion?

-[machine beeping]
-Will you look at that.

18:56.177 --> 19:00.390
Mr. Luthor, an explosion
in Gotham imbigulated
the atmosphere

19:00.473 --> 19:02.350
and pushed it 304cm...

19:02.434 --> 19:04.436
I mean, 10ft higher.

19:04.561 --> 19:07.105
We are now in range
to regenerate the ozone.

19:07.230 --> 19:09.566
Smash that follow, Professor.

19:28.293 --> 19:29.252
[sighing]

19:29.336 --> 19:31.379
Farewell, little thief boy!

19:31.463 --> 19:33.882
I am going home
to my dear Nora.

19:33.965 --> 19:35.300
Ciao ciao, Toilet!

19:46.519 --> 19:48.188
Ah! So bellissimo.

19:48.313 --> 19:52.317
I now see the world
in the artistic way
the Italians do.

20:01.159 --> 20:03.078
[fire crackling]

20:03.161 --> 20:05.455
We did it, co-workers.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.332
Pretty sure we all have
concussions,

20:07.415 --> 20:08.958
but I slept great.

20:09.042 --> 20:10.251
Should we get bagels?

20:10.335 --> 20:12.587
We still have no idea
where Ivy is.

20:12.671 --> 20:14.839
When's the swelling
gonna go down?

20:14.923 --> 20:15.840
Tell me about it.

20:15.924 --> 20:17.967
My balls are so blue.

20:18.051 --> 20:19.219
Wait, guys...

20:19.344 --> 20:21.513

20:23.014 --> 20:24.641
Who turned off the sun?

20:24.724 --> 20:25.684
My babies!

20:25.767 --> 20:26.518
They need me!

20:26.601 --> 20:28.353
Do you think Lex did this?

20:28.436 --> 20:32.190
Who cares?
Let's find someplace private
before the world ends.

20:32.315 --> 20:34.901
-Not now, I want free stuff!

'Splosions guy!
Where were you
when I needed you?

20:46.204 --> 20:47.789
I was in Italia,

20:47.872 --> 20:51.001
trying to replace the handle
of Ivy's pasta maker for you.

20:51.084 --> 20:52.419
I failed.

20:52.544 --> 20:54.546
But in my journey
of self-discovery,

20:54.671 --> 20:57.090
I achieved something
far better.

I am the pasta maker!

Hey, can you break
that window for me?

21:10.186 --> 21:12.022
I want that beach umbrella.

21:12.105 --> 21:13.106
Um...

21:13.231 --> 21:15.734
But I thought you wanted pasta.

21:17.277 --> 21:20.071
Who am I to question
my Nora's whims!

21:25.076 --> 21:28.496
Nice of you two hos to finally
join us for the apocalypse.

21:28.580 --> 21:30.331
Wait? It's already happened.

21:30.415 --> 21:32.917
Oh! We'll just go back
in the Time Sphere
and go back a week.

I meant to hit
that fancy diaper store
I've been afraid to go in.

[chuckles softly]
These hands have no precision.

21:48.767 --> 21:51.394
thickening the ozone.
But Gotham wonders,

21:51.478 --> 21:53.313
is it too thick?

21:53.438 --> 21:56.441
It seems as if Lex
has blocked out the sun
and, even worse,

21:56.566 --> 21:59.569
he has refused our request
for comment.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.404
-[whooshing]
-Halt, looters!

22:03.198 --> 22:04.032
[thuds]

22:04.949 --> 22:07.327
Oh, no. The sun!

22:07.452 --> 22:09.746
Stay away! Nobody touch me!

22:09.829 --> 22:11.581
Where's the nearest
tanning salon?

22:11.664 --> 22:13.958
Do we still have those?
As a culture?

22:14.042 --> 22:17.170
Oh, my God.
Did Lex do all this

22:17.295 --> 22:18.755
just fuck Superman?

22:18.838 --> 22:20.465
Eh, I've done worse
to fuck less,

22:20.548 --> 22:22.967
but still,
that is some petty shit.

22:23.051 --> 22:25.011
