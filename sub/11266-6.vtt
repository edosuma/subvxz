20:36.318 --> 20:37.403
I promise.

20:43.201 --> 20:44.785
(sighs)

20:44.827 --> 20:46.662
ADRIANNA:
Either I've been
out of school too long,

20:46.704 --> 20:49.665
or the People magazine
crossword puzzles have
gotten harder.

20:49.707 --> 20:51.250
Please tell me
you're joking.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.712
I'm joking.
Oh, it looks like

20:54.754 --> 20:56.881
I got a Google alert for you.
What?

20:56.923 --> 20:59.383
Oh, I-I try to keep up
with your press, okay?

20:59.425 --> 21:02.553
Ah, it looks like a sneak
peek of your photo shoot.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.514
Already? That's not
supposed to be out yet.
Yeah.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.859
What's this, Ade?

21:19.570 --> 21:21.447
(slams laptop closed)

21:22.907 --> 21:24.867
All right...
I was gonna tell you--

21:24.909 --> 21:27.161
I just thought
I had a little more time

21:27.203 --> 21:29.455
since the magazine doesn't
come out for a while.

21:29.496 --> 21:31.874
I decided to do
the topless photos.

21:31.916 --> 21:33.834
I mean, really,
what's the big deal?

21:33.876 --> 21:36.837
Lady Gaga and Katy Perry
have done way more
provocative pictures.

21:36.879 --> 21:38.589
Yeah, well, Victor made
you do it, didn't he?

21:38.631 --> 21:41.592
No. No, no.
This was my decision.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.385
Right.
The only reason
I didn't tell you

21:43.427 --> 21:45.221
is 'cause I knew
you'd get all upset.

21:45.263 --> 21:47.890
Well, of course, Ade,
of course I'd be upset!

21:47.932 --> 21:50.643
(laughs)
Well, you shouldn't be.

21:50.684 --> 21:53.187
Okay? Because
I'm happy with the pictures.

21:53.229 --> 21:54.730
In fact,

21:54.772 --> 21:56.440
I love them.

21:58.067 --> 22:02.947
(sighs) Okay, so blank Rand
wrote The Fountainhead.

22:02.989 --> 22:05.866
It's three letters--
could that be "Rob"?

22:11.705 --> 22:13.582
(door closes)

22:15.126 --> 22:17.003
(sighs)

22:19.172 --> 22:22.591
JEN (sighs):
Oh, thank God.
Elmira's not here,

22:22.633 --> 22:24.760
Debbie's getting ready for
the label party, I have to go,

22:24.802 --> 22:26.386
so can-can you
watch the baby?

22:26.428 --> 22:27.429
Of course.
Great.

22:27.471 --> 22:28.931
Did you bring the
teacher directory?

22:28.973 --> 22:31.391
Can I ask why you need it?

22:31.433 --> 22:32.476
Uh...

22:32.518 --> 22:34.645
because I'm going
to kill Mr. Cannon.

22:34.687 --> 22:35.896
Excuse me?

22:35.938 --> 22:37.481
Or castrate--

22:37.523 --> 22:38.649
I haven't decided yet.

22:38.691 --> 22:39.733
Here he is.

22:39.775 --> 22:43.070
1447...
Jen, Jen,
what's going on?

22:43.112 --> 22:44.197
What is it?

22:45.363 --> 22:47.074
Talk to me.

22:49.785 --> 22:52.621
Um...

22:52.663 --> 22:55.166
he raped Naomi.

22:56.334 --> 22:57.626
What?

22:57.668 --> 22:59.419
I, uh...

22:59.461 --> 23:01.881
overheard her
talking to Silver.

23:03.799 --> 23:06.093
Jen, I don't know
if you know this,

23:06.135 --> 23:08.054
but she falsely accused him

23:08.095 --> 23:10.181
of sexually harassing
her last year,

23:10.223 --> 23:11.557
so...

23:11.598 --> 23:14.727
I know my sister, Ryan,
and I know when she's lying,

23:14.768 --> 23:16.645
and she is not
lying about this.

23:20.398 --> 23:24.028
Uh... when did she say
that this happened?

23:24.070 --> 23:27.573
Last year, after the
Pass the Torch party.

23:31.202 --> 23:32.578
What?

23:34.705 --> 23:37.708
I was, uh... I was
in a bad state that night.

23:37.750 --> 23:41.419
I was pretty drunk,
and I... crashed my car

23:41.461 --> 23:43.214
into the West Bev sign.

23:43.256 --> 23:45.966
And, uh, nobody
knows it was me,

23:46.008 --> 23:48.177
and if they did, I'm
pretty sure I'd be fired...

23:48.219 --> 23:49.345
Uh-huh, I'm sorry, uh,

23:49.387 --> 23:51.013
and your point is what?
My point is

23:51.055 --> 23:53.557
that as I was pulling out,
I saw Cannon...

23:53.599 --> 23:54.975
and Naomi

23:55.017 --> 23:56.018
through the window.

23:56.060 --> 23:57.061
Now, I didn't see

23:57.103 --> 23:59.021
anything specific, but...

23:59.063 --> 24:00.731
he was closing the blinds,

24:00.773 --> 24:02.566
and I-I thought
it was weird...

24:02.608 --> 24:04.526
Ryan, you have
to come forward.

24:04.568 --> 24:07.738
I mean, you could
help... make her case.

it sucked?

25:23.814 --> 25:25.232
No, he's really talented,

25:25.274 --> 25:27.776
but, I mean,
it was so dark and violent.

25:27.818 --> 25:30.196
And-and then people
in the audience started

25:30.237 --> 25:32.906
talking about what
a twisted and sick writer he is,

25:32.948 --> 25:34.574
and I got really freaked out.

25:34.616 --> 25:37.036
I mean, he seems
really nice and sweet,

but there's obviously something
else going on with him.

25:39.497 --> 25:42.791

Would you like me to check
to see if another store has it?

No. I think I've bought enough

It's a job.

26:44.311 --> 26:46.897
Surely you could've
found something else.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.566
A nice kid like you?

26:48.606 --> 26:50.650
Yeah, I tried--
trust me, there's nothing.

26:50.692 --> 26:52.652
You should work for me.

26:52.694 --> 26:55.030
I need someone to help
out around the house.

26:55.072 --> 26:56.614
Run errands,
do some driving.

26:56.656 --> 26:59.326
Afternoons, after
school, of course.

26:59.368 --> 27:01.287
Really?
Are you interested?

27:01.328 --> 27:02.455
(sets down scanner)

27:02.496 --> 27:04.164
Would anyone
spray me with cologne?

27:04.206 --> 27:06.875
Then yes, I'm interested.

27:10.588 --> 27:12.298
I'm Sandra, by the way.

27:12.339 --> 27:13.715

Nice to meet
you, Liam.

27:15.884 --> 27:17.177
Thank you.

27:17.219 --> 27:19.679
We live in the hills.
Where do you live?

27:19.721 --> 27:22.266
Um... well,
right now, I, uh...

27:23.850 --> 27:25.603
I'm kind of
living in my car.

27:27.563 --> 27:29.022
Some bad stuff happened
with my family,

27:29.064 --> 27:30.857
but as soon as
I get enough money...

27:30.899 --> 27:33.444
You can't live in your car--
you're just a kid.

27:34.945 --> 27:36.863
You'll stay in my pool house.

27:36.905 --> 27:38.907
What?
Temporarily.

27:38.949 --> 27:41.701
Until you find more
permanent accommodations.

27:41.743 --> 27:43.745
I don't know what to say.

27:43.787 --> 27:45.831
How about "yes"?

27:45.872 --> 27:47.833
Yes. Yeah.
Great.

27:47.874 --> 27:49.876
I'll be in touch.
Okay.

27:52.754 --> 27:53.922
Hey, Ronnie!

27:53.964 --> 27:55.299
I quit!

27:55.341 --> 27:57.009
(typing)

27:57.050 --> 27:59.303
Hey, uh... do you remember at
the beginning of the school year

27:59.345 --> 28:02.055
when everybody promised
to stay late and help
me put out the Blaze?

28:02.097 --> 28:03.098
Sure do.

28:03.140 --> 28:04.891
That was a load
of crap, huh?

28:04.933 --> 28:05.976
Sure was.

28:07.102 --> 28:08.479
Good to know.

28:08.521 --> 28:09.396
All right,
it's a wrap.

28:09.438 --> 28:10.481
You ready to roll?

28:10.523 --> 28:11.898
NAVID:
We're gonna miss the party.

28:11.940 --> 28:13.775
Yeah. I just need
another two minutes

28:13.817 --> 28:16.529
to finish synching this audio
for my documentary...

28:16.570 --> 28:17.737
VICTOR:
Don't be a child.

28:17.779 --> 28:19.031
You can cover up artistically...

28:19.072 --> 28:20.907
NAVID:
Okay, okay, that's enough.

28:20.949 --> 28:22.368
Navid, it's okay.
No, it's not okay.

28:22.409 --> 28:23.910
She doesn't want to go topless,
she's not going topless,

28:23.952 --> 28:24.911
you got it?

28:24.953 --> 28:26.038
I can do this later.

28:26.079 --> 28:28.248
No. It's okay, I'm fine.
Go ahead.

28:28.290 --> 28:29.667
(presses keys)

28:29.707 --> 28:31.418
ADRIANNA:
...okay? I know
where my line is,

28:31.460 --> 28:32.752
and I'm not gonna cross it.

28:32.794 --> 28:34.254
VICTOR:
Okay, you heard her.
Everybody out.

28:34.296 --> 28:37.508
You, too, legs. You can
get your equipment later.

28:37.550 --> 28:39.677
Oh, well, that was even
better the second time.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.053
I'm sorry.

28:41.094 --> 28:43.597
VICTOR:
How many times do I have
to explain it to you?

28:43.639 --> 28:45.558
You work for me;
I call the shots.

28:45.599 --> 28:47.267
ADRIANNA: Yeah, but Victor,
this is different.
What is this?

28:47.309 --> 28:48.935
Uh, their mics are still on.

28:48.977 --> 28:50.563
ADRIANNA:
I'm really not
comfortable with this.

28:50.604 --> 28:51.771
VICTOR:
Would you be

28:51.813 --> 28:55.025
more comfortable if I told
everybody what you did?

28:55.067 --> 28:57.027
ADRIANNA (sighs):
Okay,

28:57.069 --> 28:58.904
I'll do it.

28:58.945 --> 29:01.490
VICTOR:
Okay.

29:05.703 --> 29:07.871
I love your lyrics.
Honestly, like, if I
could write like that,

29:07.913 --> 29:09.122
it just would
be... incredible.

29:09.164 --> 29:12.668
Uh, what does, uh,
Victor have on you?

29:12.710 --> 29:15.462
Um, excuse me.
Sorry.

29:15.504 --> 29:17.172
I don't know what
you're talking about.

29:17.214 --> 29:19.799
Now, just cut the
crap, Ade-- I heard
Victor threatening you.

29:19.841 --> 29:21.260
After I left
the photo shoot,

29:21.301 --> 29:22.261
your mic was still on.

29:22.302 --> 29:23.345
What does he have on you?

29:23.387 --> 29:24.555
Tell me.

29:29.727 --> 29:33.480
I thought I was gonna
get dropped by the label...

29:33.522 --> 29:38.026
and Javier had this notebook
full of songs...

29:38.068 --> 29:40.028
so after he died...

29:41.488 --> 29:43.657
...I took it.

29:43.699 --> 29:45.033
(sighs)

29:45.075 --> 29:46.493
What?

29:46.535 --> 29:48.704
I thought if
I had one good song,

29:48.746 --> 29:51.998
I thought I'd be able to get
back in there with the label.

29:53.584 --> 29:55.544
Do you hate me?

29:55.586 --> 29:57.045
Uh...

29:57.087 --> 29:59.214
no, but Ade,
what you did, it's...

29:59.256 --> 30:00.674
It's awful, I know.

30:00.716 --> 30:01.967
And Victor found out?

30:02.008 --> 30:03.260
He's horrible, Navid.

30:03.302 --> 30:04.553
I hate him.

30:04.595 --> 30:07.055
But if I leave him,
he's gonna expose me.

30:07.097 --> 30:08.307
So what's the plan,

30:08.348 --> 30:09.558
you stay beholden
to this dirt bag?
