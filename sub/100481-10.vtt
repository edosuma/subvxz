WELCOME AGAIN TO THIS WHITE

00:29.508 --> 00:30.709
VOID.

00:30.776 --> 00:32.883
WHICH I'VE JUST REALIZED I'VE

00:32.883 --> 00:33.577
NEVER ACTUALLY GIVEN YOU A

00:33.577 --> 00:34.040
PROPER TOUR OF.

00:34.040 --> 00:34.772
SO LET ME SHOW YOU AROUND: THIS

00:34.772 --> 00:35.606
IS THE WHITE HERE, THIS IS THE

00:35.673 --> 00:36.206
VOID, AND THIS IS WHERE I KEEP

00:36.273 --> 00:36.774
MY GENERALIZED ANXIETY ABOUT

00:36.840 --> 00:37.875
SOCIETY'S UNCERTAIN FUTURE AND

00:37.941 --> 00:38.876
MY OWN UNAVOIDABLE MORTALITY.

00:38.942 --> 00:40.110
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE A SPACE

00:40.177 --> 00:41.378
COULD SIMULTANEOUSLY FEEL SO

00:41.445 --> 00:42.479
EMPTY AND YET SO CRUSHINGLY

00:42.546 --> 00:44.415
FULL.

00:46.036 --> 00:47.438
LOOK, IT'S BEEN ANOTHER GRIM

00:47.504 --> 00:48.839
WEEK, WITH NEWS OF THE GLOBAL

00:48.906 --> 00:50.040
PANDEMIC BROKEN UP ONLY BY

00:50.107 --> 00:51.375
FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS SURROUNDING

00:51.442 --> 00:53.410
TARA READE, THE FORMER SENATE

00:53.477 --> 00:54.478
AIDE WHO'S ACCUSED JOE BIDEN OF

00:54.545 --> 00:56.647
SEXUAL ASSAULT.

00:56.714 --> 00:59.316
NOW, HE'S DENIED THE CLAIM, BUT

00:59.383 --> 01:00.117
THERE ARE CLEARLY BIG QUESTIONS

01:00.184 --> 01:02.486
STILL TO BE ANSWERED HERE.

01:02.553 --> 01:03.520
AND TARA READE ABSOLUTELY

01:03.587 --> 01:05.756
DESERVES TO BE HEARD,

01:05.823 --> 01:07.258
THE WAY THAT ANYONE DOES WHEN

01:07.324 --> 01:08.692
THEY MAKE THE DIFFICULT CHOICE

01:08.759 --> 01:10.461
TO COME FORWARD WITH ALLEGATIONS

01:10.527 --> 01:11.395
OF THIS KIND, WHICH SHOULD, OF

01:11.462 --> 01:16.433
COURSE, BE FULLY INVESTIGATED.

01:16.500 --> 01:18.569
AND I AM SURE THAT WE WILL TALK

01:18.636 --> 01:20.838
MORE ABOUT THIS AS THE STORY

01:20.905 --> 01:21.071
UNFOLDS.

01:21.138 --> 01:22.006
BUT FOR NOW, LET'S MOVE ON TO

01:22.072 --> 01:22.840
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT, WHICH

01:22.907 --> 01:23.307
YET AGAIN CONCERNS THE

01:23.374 --> 01:24.708
CORONAVIRUS, VERY MUCH THE

01:24.775 --> 01:25.643
TIMOTHEE CHALAMET OF VIRUSES IN

01:25.709 --> 01:26.377
THAT YOU BARELY HAD TIME TO

01:26.443 --> 01:27.811
LEARN ITS NAME BEFORE, SUDDENLY,

01:27.878 --> 01:30.214
IT WAS FUCKING EVERYWHERE.

01:30.281 --> 01:31.715
IT'S BEEN ANOTHER TOUGH WEEK,

01:31.782 --> 01:33.384
AND EVERYONE IS ABSOLUTELY

01:33.450 --> 01:36.387
DESPERATE TO GET OUTSIDE ‐‐

01:36.453 --> 01:37.021
PERHAPS NO ONE MORE SO

01:37.087 --> 01:37.988
THAN ALEX JONES, WHO'S GONE FROM

01:38.055 --> 01:39.089
LEADING PROTESTS AGAINST

01:39.156 --> 01:40.090
STAY‐AT‐HOME ORDERS AT THE TEXAS

01:40.157 --> 01:43.060
CAPITOL TO THIS:

01:43.127 --> 01:43.694
>> I'LL ADMIT IT, I WILL EAT MY

01:43.761 --> 01:45.195
NEIGHBORS.

01:45.262 --> 01:47.231
I'M NOT LETTING MY KIDS DIE.

01:47.298 --> 01:47.765
I'M JUST GONNA BE HONEST.

01:47.831 --> 01:49.934
MY SUPERPOWER IS BEING HONEST.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.869
I HAVE EXTRAPOLATED THIS OUT,

01:51.936 --> 01:55.105
AND I WON'T HAVE TO FOR A FEW

01:55.172 --> 01:55.906
YEARS, 'CAUSE I GOT FOOD AND

01:55.973 --> 01:57.508
STUFF, BUT I'M LITERALLY LOOKING

01:57.574 --> 01:58.642
AT MY NEIGHBORS NOW AND GOING,

01:58.709 --> 01:59.276
I'M READY TO HANG 'EM UP AND

01:59.343 --> 02:00.210
GUT 'EM AND SKIN 'EM AND CHOP

02:00.277 --> 02:02.146
'EM UP.

02:02.212 --> 02:02.980
YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M READY.

02:03.047 --> 02:03.614
MY DAUGHTERS AREN'T STARVING TO

02:03.681 --> 02:04.515
DEATH.

02:04.581 --> 02:05.482
I'LL EAT MY NEIGHBORS.

02:05.549 --> 02:06.250
SEE, MY SUPERPOWER IS BEING

02:06.317 --> 02:07.017
HONEST.

02:07.084 --> 02:08.285
I'LL EAT YOUR ASS.

02:08.352 --> 02:10.487
>> John: WOW.

02:10.554 --> 02:11.355
THERE IS A LOT TO UNPACK THERE.

02:11.422 --> 02:12.556
OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S THE

02:12.623 --> 02:14.024
ASS‐EATING PROMISE.

02:14.091 --> 02:15.426
BUT EVEN BEFORE THAT, HE'S

02:15.492 --> 02:18.729
THREATENING TO FEED HIS

02:18.796 --> 02:19.296
NEIGHBORS TO HIS DAUGHTERS,

02:19.363 --> 02:20.130
WHICH IS WEIRD ENOUGH BEFORE YOU

02:20.197 --> 02:21.665
CONSIDER HE ALSO HAS A SON.

02:21.732 --> 02:24.768
WHAT ABOUT HIM, A. J.?

02:24.835 --> 02:27.171
WHY DOESN'T HE GET TO EAT ANY

02:27.237 --> 02:27.938
HUMAN FLESH?

02:28.005 --> 02:28.806
AND FINALLY, ALEX JONES IS

02:28.872 --> 02:30.174
MAKING PLANS TO DESPERATELY

02:30.240 --> 02:31.208
DEVOUR HIS NEIGHBORS SEVERAL

02:31.275 --> 02:32.142
YEARS OUT WHILE ALSO WEARING AN

02:32.209 --> 02:34.878
$8,000 WATCH.

02:34.945 --> 02:36.246
I'D MAYBE AT LEAST CONSIDER

02:36.313 --> 02:38.082
SELLING THAT, OR, I DUNNO,

02:38.148 --> 02:39.984
PLANTING A GARDEN BEFORE

02:40.050 --> 02:44.822
STOOPING TO ACTUAL CANNIBALISM.

02:44.888 --> 02:45.723
BUT, LOOK, THINGS ARE CLEARLY

02:45.789 --> 02:46.623
DIRE RIGHT NOW.

02:46.690 --> 02:48.258
THE CORONAVIRUS DEATH TOLL IS

02:48.325 --> 02:52.229
OVER 60,000 IN THE U. S.,

02:52.296 --> 02:54.098
MEANING IN JUST THREE MONTHS,

02:54.164 --> 02:55.165
IT'S KILLED MORE AMERICANS THAN

02:55.232 --> 02:56.500
THE VIETNAM WAR, WHICH IS A

02:56.567 --> 02:57.501
TRULY GRIM MILESTONE.

02:57.568 --> 02:58.335
AND THAT'S WHAT MADE IT SO

02:58.402 --> 02:59.269
JARRING TO SEE JARED KUSHNER

02:59.336 --> 03:00.104
AND HIS RESTING

03:00.170 --> 03:01.672
DO‐YOU‐KNOW‐WHO‐MY‐FATHER‐IS

03:01.739 --> 03:03.140
FACE BASICALLY DECLARE VICTORY

03:03.207 --> 03:05.876
OVER THE VIRUS ON WEDNESDAY.

03:05.943 --> 03:07.311
>> THE GOVERNMENT, THE FEDERAL

03:07.378 --> 03:09.680
GOVERNMENT ROSE TO THE CHALLENGE

03:09.747 --> 03:10.981
AND THIS IS GREAT SUCCESS STORY,

03:11.048 --> 03:11.615
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY,

03:11.682 --> 03:12.483
YOU KNOW, WHAT NEEDS TO BE TOLD.

03:12.549 --> 03:13.417
I THINK YOU WILL SEE BY JUNE A

03:13.484 --> 03:14.918
LOT OF THE COUNTRY SHOULD BE

03:14.985 --> 03:16.553
BACK TO NORMAL AND THE HOPE IS

03:16.620 --> 03:17.855
BY JULY THE COUNTRY IS REALLY

03:17.921 --> 03:19.823
ROCKING AGAIN.

03:19.890 --> 03:21.792
>> John: OH, IT'LL BE "REALLY

03:21.859 --> 03:23.060
ROCKING AGAIN," WILL IT, JARED?

03:23.127 --> 03:24.495
IT'S INCREDIBLE TO SEE SOMEONE

03:24.561 --> 03:25.996
WITH THE SKIN OF A NEWBORN BABY

03:26.063 --> 03:27.865
BIRTHED IN A TUB OF NEUTROGENA

03:27.931 --> 03:33.337
TALK LIKE A MIDDLE‐AGED DAD

03:33.404 --> 03:34.438
DESPERATELY TRYING TO CONNECT

03:34.505 --> 03:34.905
WITH HIS TEENAGE SON.

03:34.972 --> 03:35.472
BUT BEFORE WE CAN CELEBRATE

03:35.539 --> 03:36.707
JARED'S "GREAT SUCCESS STORY"

03:36.774 --> 03:37.741
AND GET BACK TO OUR ROCKIN'

03:37.808 --> 03:39.109
SELVES, WE BADLY NEED TO WORK

03:39.176 --> 03:39.943
OUT HOW WE CAN REOPEN PARTS OF

03:40.010 --> 03:42.346
SOCIETY SAFELY.

03:42.413 --> 03:43.647
AND EXPERTS SAY THAT MEANS ONE

03:43.714 --> 03:45.449
THING.

03:45.516 --> 03:47.217
>> EVERY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIAL

03:47.284 --> 03:47.951
SAYS "TESTING, TESTING,

03:48.018 --> 03:48.752
TESTING."

03:48.819 --> 03:49.920
>> TESTING, TESTING, TESTING.

03:49.987 --> 03:51.488
>> TESTING, TESTING, TESTING.

03:51.555 --> 03:53.323
>> TESTING, TESTING, TESTING.

03:53.390 --> 03:54.691
>> TESTING, TESTING, TESTING.

03:54.758 --> 03:57.061
>> TESTING, TESTING, TESTING.

03:57.127 --> 03:58.228
>> TESTING, TESTING, TESTING,

03:58.295 --> 04:00.431
TESTING.

04:00.497 --> 04:01.231
>> TESTING, TESTING, TESTING,

04:01.298 --> 04:01.799
TESTING, TESTING, TESTING,

04:01.865 --> 04:02.366
TESTING!

04:02.433 --> 04:03.100
TESTING!

04:03.167 --> 04:06.136
[SCREAMS]

04:06.203 --> 04:06.804
>> John: YEAH, GOOD POINT,

04:06.870 --> 04:07.037
PATRICK.

04:07.104 --> 04:07.838
SPONGEBOB SHOULDN'T BE TAKING

04:07.905 --> 04:09.106
JOY RIDES IN HIS OPEN‐WATER

04:09.173 --> 04:10.507
CONVERTIBLE WHILE WEARING A

04:10.574 --> 04:11.675
COWBOY HAT AND NO MASK UNTIL WE

04:11.742 --> 04:14.211
HAVE ADEQUATE TESTING IN PLACE.

04:14.278 --> 04:15.913
ABSORBENT AND YELLOW AND POROUS

04:15.979 --> 04:17.147
IS HE.

04:17.214 --> 04:18.382
TWO OUT OF THREE OF THOSE ARE

04:18.449 --> 04:22.319
EXTREMELY HIGH‐RISK CATEGORIES.

04:22.386 --> 04:24.421
SO GET IN YOUR FUCKING

04:24.488 --> 04:25.756
PINEAPPLE, SPONGEBOB!

04:25.823 --> 04:27.291
BUT THOSE EXPERTS ARE RIGHT: IN

04:27.357 --> 04:27.858
MANAGING A PANDEMIC, THERE'S

04:27.925 --> 04:28.859
ALMOST NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT

04:28.926 --> 04:29.793
THAN WIDESPREAD, EFFECTIVE

04:29.860 --> 04:31.762
TESTING.

04:31.829 --> 04:33.030
IT IS YOUR ONLY CHANCE OF

04:33.097 --> 04:34.131
TRACKING AND CONTAINING THE

04:34.198 --> 04:36.033
SPREAD FROM THE START.

04:36.100 --> 04:37.601
UNFORTUNATELY, TESTS HAVE BEEN

04:37.668 --> 04:39.636
ALARMINGLY SCARCE IN THIS

04:39.703 --> 04:41.839
COUNTRY, DESPITE THE FACT THE

04:41.905 --> 04:44.975
PRESIDENT HAS REPEATEDLY CLAIMED

04:45.042 --> 04:46.009
THAT THAT IS NOT THE CASE, EVEN

04:46.076 --> 04:47.111
DECLARING IN EARLY MARCH THAT

04:47.177 --> 04:47.878
"ANYONE WHO WANTS A TEST CAN GET

04:47.945 --> 04:49.413
A TEST."

04:49.480 --> 04:51.482
BUT THAT WASN'T TRUE THEN, AND

04:51.548 --> 04:53.117
IT STILL ISN'T TRUE NOW ‐‐ AS

04:53.183 --> 04:54.751
YOU PROBABLY KNOW FROM SEEING

04:54.818 --> 04:55.619
COUNTLESS STORIES LIKE THIS:

04:55.686 --> 04:56.887
>> DAWN CLEMENTS IN LARGO,

04:56.954 --> 04:57.888
FLORIDA, HAS BEEN SICK SINCE

04:57.955 --> 04:59.690
FRIDAY.

04:59.756 --> 05:01.291
HER DAUGHTER WENT THROUGH IT

05:01.358 --> 05:02.593
TWO WEEKS AGO.

05:02.659 --> 05:03.994
SHE HAS ALL THE SYMPTOMS, NO

05:04.061 --> 05:07.064
FLU, AND CAN'T GET TESTED.

05:07.131 --> 05:09.500
>> I'M IMMUNOSUPPRESSED WITH

05:09.566 --> 05:11.635
SOME HEALTH CONDITIONS, AND I

05:11.702 --> 05:14.905
LIVE AT AN A. L. F.

05:14.972 --> 05:15.706
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT VIRUS I

05:15.772 --> 05:17.708
HAVE.

05:17.774 --> 05:19.042
I'M RUNNING A FEVER, AND I HAVE

05:19.109 --> 05:21.278
CHEST CONGESTION.

05:21.345 --> 05:24.748
AND NOBODY CAN TEST US HERE.

05:24.815 --> 05:26.483
>> John: THAT IS TERRIBLE.

05:26.550 --> 05:27.451
A WOMAN WHO'S SYMPTOMATIC,

05:27.518 --> 05:30.954
IMMUNOSUPPRESSED, AND LIVING IN

05:31.021 --> 05:31.555
AN A. L. F. SOUNDS LIKE EXACTLY

05:31.622 --> 05:32.189
THE KIND OF PERSON YOU'D WANT TO

05:32.256 --> 05:34.224
HAVE TESTED.

05:34.291 --> 05:35.559
NOW, A. L. F., INCIDENTALLY,

05:35.626 --> 05:39.096
REFERS TO "ASSISTED LIVING

05:39.163 --> 05:39.663
FACILITY," AND NOT THE '80s

05:39.730 --> 05:40.397
SITCOM ALIEN.

05:40.464 --> 05:41.665
ALTHOUGH, IF SHE WERE LIVING IN

05:41.732 --> 05:43.133
ALF, SHE SHOULD PROBABLY STILL

05:43.200 --> 05:45.068
GET TESTED, SINCE I'VE HEARD

05:45.135 --> 05:46.470
RUMORS THAT THIS WHOLE THING

05:46.537 --> 05:47.905
STARTED WHEN SOMEONE ATE A BOWL

05:47.971 --> 05:50.974
OF ALF SOUP.

05:51.041 --> 05:53.710
AND SHE'S FRANKLY FAR FROM

05:53.777 --> 05:54.578
ALONE HERE.

05:54.645 --> 05:55.512
TESTING HAS ONLY RECENTLY,

05:55.579 --> 05:56.380
MONTHS IN TO THE SPREAD OF THE

05:56.446 --> 05:57.181
VIRUS, BECOME MORE WIDELY

05:57.247 --> 05:57.781
AVAILABLE.

05:57.848 --> 05:59.216
IN FACT, OUR TESTING FAILURE HAS

05:59.283 --> 06:00.117
BEEN CALLED THE "ORIGINAL SIN"

06:00.184 --> 06:01.552
OF AMERICA'S PANDEMIC FAILURE,

06:01.618 --> 06:03.520
BECAUSE HAD TESTING CAUGHT THE

06:03.587 --> 06:05.556
CASES IN THIS COUNTRY EARLY, WE

06:05.622 --> 06:07.057
COULD HAVE MANAGED THE VIRUS

06:07.124 --> 06:07.758
THROUGH CONTACT TRACING AND

06:07.824 --> 06:12.829
TARGETED QUARANTINES.

06:12.896 --> 06:14.932
BUT THAT DID NOT HAPPEN, SO THE

06:14.998 --> 06:15.632
VIRUS SPREAD, FORCING US TO USE

06:15.699 --> 06:17.100
THE BLUNT INSTRUMENT OF MAKING

06:17.167 --> 06:18.602
EVERYONE STAY AT HOME.

06:18.669 --> 06:20.404
A LACK OF TESTING GOES TO THE

06:20.470 --> 06:21.838
VERY HEART OF HOW WE GOT INTO

06:21.905 --> 06:23.607
THIS SITUATION.

06:23.674 --> 06:25.509
AND THE TRUTH IS, BROAD TESTING

06:25.576 --> 06:27.377
IS OUR ONLY SAFE WAY OUT OF IT.

06:27.444 --> 06:29.813
WHILE EXPERTS DISAGREE ON THE

06:29.880 --> 06:31.248
EXACT NUMBER OF TESTS WE NEED TO

06:31.315 --> 06:34.618
BE DOING TO SAFELY REOPEN, THE

06:34.685 --> 06:35.185
LOWEST ESTIMATE IS 500,000 A

06:35.252 --> 06:40.023
DAY, WITH OTHERS SAYING A GOOD

06:40.090 --> 06:42.559
TARGET ACTUALLY WOULD BE

06:42.626 --> 06:43.193
35 MILLION A DAY.

06:43.260 --> 06:46.163
AND AT PRESENT, WE'VE ONLY BEEN

06:46.230 --> 06:47.297
PERFORMING AROUND 200,000 A DAY.

06:47.364 --> 06:48.565
SO WE'RE NOT EVEN HITTING THE

06:48.632 --> 06:49.433
LOWEST TARGET HERE.

06:49.499 --> 06:50.801
THINK OF IT LIKE THIS: IF OUR

06:50.867 --> 06:51.368
GOAL WERE TO EAT AN ITALIAN

06:51.435 --> 06:52.135
DINNER, WE'RE CURRENTLY STUCK

06:52.202 --> 06:53.170
IN TRAFFIC ON OUR WAY TO AN

06:53.237 --> 06:54.972
OLIVE GARDEN.

06:55.038 --> 06:55.939
WE'RE NOT EVEN HALFWAY TO

06:56.006 --> 06:58.809
ARRIVING AT THE WORST PLACE THAT

06:58.875 --> 06:59.276
TECHNICALLY QUALIFIES.

06:59.343 --> 07:00.644
SO IF OUR TESTING SHORTAGE HAS

07:00.711 --> 07:02.646
CAUSED THIS MUCH DAMAGE, THIS

07:02.713 --> 07:04.314
MUCH DISRUPTION, AND IS STILL

07:04.381 --> 07:05.515
NOT FULLY RESOLVED, WE THOUGHT

07:05.582 --> 07:08.252
TONIGHT MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME TO

07:08.318 --> 07:10.921
ASK: WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED?

07:10.988 --> 07:12.322
AND TO DO THAT, WE'RE GOING TO

07:12.389 --> 07:14.291
BE LOOKING AT TWO MAJOR TYPES OF

07:14.358 --> 07:15.859
TESTS: DIAGNOSTIC TESTS, WHICH

07:15.926 --> 07:18.462
TELL YOU IF YOU HAVE THE VIRUS

07:18.528 --> 07:19.363
RIGHT NOW, AND ANTIBODY TESTS,

07:19.429 --> 07:20.097
WHICH TELL YOU IF YOU'VE

07:20.163 --> 07:21.765
PREVIOUSLY HAD IT.

07:21.832 --> 07:22.399
AND LET'S START WITH DIAGNOSTIC

07:22.466 --> 07:26.336
TESTS.

07:26.403 --> 07:27.871
THE MOST COMMON FORM OF THESE

07:27.938 --> 07:29.439
INVOLVE HAVING A GIANT SWAB

07:29.506 --> 07:31.008
SHOVED UP YOUR NOSE, AND I DON'T

07:31.074 --> 07:31.608
THINK ANYONE HAS DESCRIBED THE

07:31.675 --> 07:32.175
EXPERIENCE BETTER THAN THIS

07:32.242 --> 07:34.144
WOMAN:

07:34.211 --> 07:35.445
>> OH, MY GOD, THEY JUST PULLED

07:35.512 --> 07:37.881
MY BRAIN OUT THROUGH MY NOSTRIL.

07:37.948 --> 07:39.449
I WAS LOOKING ‐‐ I CAN TASTE

07:39.516 --> 07:42.019
BLOOD.

07:42.085 --> 07:43.220
THAT WOMAN TOOK MY SOUL OUT OF

07:43.287 --> 07:45.789
MY HEAD WITH THAT Q‐TIP.

07:45.856 --> 07:47.958
SHE ACTUALLY GRABBED THE BACK OF

07:48.025 --> 07:49.793
MY HEAD, LIKE WE WERE LOVERS,

07:49.860 --> 07:51.662
BUT INSTEAD OF KISSING ME, SHE

07:51.728 --> 07:54.264
WAS IMPALING MY BRAIN.

07:54.331 --> 07:57.034
>> John: YEAH, THAT SOUNDS

07:57.100 --> 07:58.201
PRETTY UNPLEASANT.

07:58.268 --> 07:59.403
UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOUR BRAIN IS

07:59.469 --> 08:00.737
BEING PULLED OUT THROUGH YOUR

08:00.804 --> 08:02.439
NOSTRIL BY ADAM DRIVER.

08:02.506 --> 08:03.674
PULL MY HEART OUT THROUGH MY

08:03.740 --> 08:06.510
EAR, YOU MEATY OAK TREE.

08:06.576 --> 08:07.644
IMPALE MY BRAIN, YOU

08:07.711 --> 08:10.414
UNACCEPTABLE MONSTROSITY.

08:10.480 --> 08:12.282
NOW, DIAGNOSTIC TESTS ARE KEY,

08:12.349 --> 08:15.118
ESPECIALLY EARLY ON IN AN

08:15.185 --> 08:16.620
OUTBREAK.

08:16.687 --> 08:17.354
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, THE U. S.

08:17.421 --> 08:19.089
COMMITTED SOME CRITICAL ERRORS

08:19.156 --> 08:20.957
EARLY ON, BECAUSE IN

08:21.024 --> 08:22.459
MID‐JANUARY, SHORTLY AFTER THIS

08:22.526 --> 08:23.493
VIRUS WAS DISCOVERED, THE WORLD

08:23.560 --> 08:25.562
HEALTH ORGANIZATION RECOMMENDED

08:25.629 --> 08:27.564
A DIAGNOSTIC TESTING PROTOCOL.

08:27.631 --> 08:30.500
BUT RATHER THAN FOLLOW IT, THE

08:30.567 --> 08:31.501
CDC DECIDED TO DEVELOP ITS OWN,

08:31.568 --> 08:33.537
MORE COMPLICATED, TEST.

08:33.603 --> 08:34.671
WHICH WASN'T INHERENTLY A BAD

08:34.738 --> 08:37.140
IDEA.

08:37.207 --> 08:38.241
UNFORTUNATELY THOUGH, THEY CHOSE

08:38.308 --> 08:39.409
TO MANUFACTURE TESTING KITS

08:39.476 --> 08:42.813
THEMSELVES, AND AS THOSE KITS

08:42.879 --> 08:43.447
WERE SHIPPED AROUND THE COUNTRY

08:43.513 --> 08:44.381
IN EARLY FEBRUARY, IT BECAME

08:44.448 --> 08:45.982
CLEAR THAT, DUE TO CHEMICAL

08:46.049 --> 08:47.517
CONTAMINATION DURING

08:47.584 --> 08:49.353
MANUFACTURING, THE TESTS DIDN'T

08:49.419 --> 08:50.454
WORK PROPERLY.

08:50.520 --> 08:55.826
AND THAT WAS ALREADY BAD.

08:55.892 --> 08:57.394
BUT WHAT MADE IT EVEN WORSE WAS,

08:57.461 --> 08:58.628
THE CDC THEN TOOK WEEKS TO COME

08:58.695 --> 08:59.496
UP WITH A WORKAROUND THAT WOULD

08:59.563 --> 09:00.864
MAKE THE TEST KITS USABLE.

09:00.931 --> 09:01.665
AND JUST LOSING DAYS IN A

09:01.732 --> 09:02.265
PANDEMIC, WHEN A VIRUS CAN

09:02.332 --> 09:03.467
SPREAD EXPONENTIALLY, IS A HUGE

09:03.533 --> 09:05.402
PROBLEM.

09:05.469 --> 09:09.072
LOSING AN ENTIRE MONTH IS

09:09.139 --> 09:10.207
ABSOLUTELY CATASTROPHIC.

09:10.273 --> 09:11.908
AND WHAT'S PARTICULARLY

09:11.975 --> 09:13.844
FRUSTRATING HERE IS THAT SOME

09:13.910 --> 09:15.212
PRIVATE SECTOR LABS WERE WILLING

09:15.278 --> 09:16.513
TO JUMP IN AND DEVELOP THEIR OWN

09:16.580 --> 09:18.448
TESTS, BUT THROUGHOUT FEBRUARY,

09:18.515 --> 09:19.750
THEY WERE SLOWED DOWN BY HAVING

09:19.816 --> 09:21.385
TO JUMP THROUGH BUREAUCRATIC

09:21.451 --> 09:22.119
HOOPS LIKE THIS.

09:22.185 --> 09:23.186
>> ONE OF THE THINGS IS, THEY

09:23.253 --> 09:23.820
NEEDED A DOCUMENT FEDEXED ACROSS

09:23.887 --> 09:24.688
THE COUNTRY BEFORE THEY COULD

09:24.755 --> 09:25.922
LOOK AT THE DOCUMENT.

09:25.989 --> 09:27.124
>> YOU COULDN'T ELECTRONICALLY

09:27.190 --> 09:27.624
TRANSMIT IT?

09:27.691 --> 09:28.825
>> I COULD ELECTRONICALLY

09:28.892 --> 09:29.459
TRANSMIT IT, BUT THEY COULDN'T

09:29.526 --> 09:30.427
LOOK AT IT UNTIL IT WAS FEDEXED.

09:30.494 --> 09:31.094
AND THEN THEY CHANGED THAT

09:31.161 --> 09:31.962
REGULATION.

09:32.028 --> 09:33.029
AND SO FROM A COUPLE DAYS AFTER

09:33.096 --> 09:34.531
FEBRUARY 4 ALL THE WAY TO

09:34.598 --> 09:35.632
FEBRUARY 26, THEY DIDN'T HAVE A

09:35.699 --> 09:36.666
TEST.

09:36.733 --> 09:37.901
THEY WERE COMPLETELY BLIND TOO.

09:37.968 --> 09:38.902
>> THIS HAD TO BE INCREDIBLY

09:38.969 --> 09:39.336
FRUSTRATING.

09:39.403 --> 09:40.904
>> IT WAS FRUSTRATING.

09:40.971 --> 09:42.539
IT WAS.

09:42.606 --> 09:44.307
>> John: YEAH, I BET IT WAS.

09:44.374 --> 09:46.676
IN FACT, THE FDA SUGGESTED TO

09:46.743 --> 09:47.644
HIM THAT HE SEND A PRINTED PAPER

09:47.711 --> 09:50.447
HARD COPY OF THE SUBMISSION AND

09:50.514 --> 09:51.515
A CD OR THUMB DRIVE WITH AN

09:51.581 --> 09:53.150
ELECTRONIC COPY.

09:53.216 --> 09:54.718
AND WHERE WOULD YOU EVEN FIND A

09:54.785 --> 09:57.320
BLANK CD?

09:57.387 --> 09:59.423
AT A WALGREENS 20 YEARS AGO?

09:59.489 --> 10:02.526
OR DOES THE FDA EXPECT EVERYONE

10:02.592 --> 10:05.529
TO BURN OVER ROAD JAMZ 2005?

10:05.595 --> 10:10.600
BECAUSE NO FUCKING WAY, FDA!

10:10.667 --> 10:11.435
THAT'S A CLASSIC MIX RIGHT

10:11.501 --> 10:11.635
THERE!

10:11.701 --> 10:12.736
IT'S GOT ALL THE SONGS FROM

10:12.803 --> 10:13.970
"AMERICAN IDIOT" IN THE ORDER

10:14.037 --> 10:15.705
THEY APPEARED ON

10:15.772 --> 10:17.574
"AMERICAN IDIOT," BUT BETTER,

10:17.641 --> 10:18.141
BECAUSE THEY WERE STOLEN OFF

10:18.208 --> 10:18.408
LIMEWIRE.

10:18.475 --> 10:19.376
AND WHILE THAT REQUIREMENT WAS

10:19.443 --> 10:20.010
QUICKLY LIFTED, IT WAS JUST ONE

10:20.076 --> 10:21.211
OF MANY LOGISTICAL AND

10:21.278 --> 10:22.446
BUREAUCRATIC CHALLENGES THAT

10:22.512 --> 10:23.613
SLOWED THINGS DOWN AT THE WORST

10:23.680 --> 10:26.383
POSSIBLE TIME.

10:26.450 --> 10:27.918
IN FACT, IT WASN'T UNTIL THE

10:27.984 --> 10:36.393
LAST DAY OF FEBRUARY THAT THE

10:36.460 --> 10:38.628
FDA FINALLY DID SOMETHING THAT

10:38.695 --> 10:39.296
PRIVATE LABS HAD BEEN BEGGING

10:39.362 --> 10:41.865
THEM TO DO AND ALLOWED THEM TO

10:41.932 --> 10:42.632
START DEVELOPING AND USING THEIR

10:42.699 --> 10:43.700
OWN TESTS WITHOUT WAITING FOR

10:43.767 --> 10:44.768
AUTHORIZATION.

10:44.835 --> 10:45.969
BUT BY THAT POINT, A WHOLE MONTH

10:46.036 --> 10:47.137
HAD GONE BY, AND INCREDIBLY,

10:47.204 --> 10:47.838
WE'D ONLY TESTED, IN THE WHOLE

10:47.904 --> 10:51.074
COUNTRY, 472 PEOPLE, IN TOTAL.

10:51.141 --> 10:51.842
THAT IS IT.

10:51.908 --> 10:52.742
EVEN AS ‐‐ WE'VE SINCE

10:52.809 --> 10:53.477
LEARNED ‐‐ THE VIRUS WAS

10:53.543 --> 10:54.411
SPREADING UNDETECTED IN MULTIPLE

10:54.478 --> 10:56.313
MAJOR CITIES.

10:56.379 --> 10:58.515
NOW, BY CONTRAST, ON THE SAME

10:58.582 --> 11:00.750
DATE, SOUTH KOREA ‐‐ WHICH HAS

11:00.817 --> 11:02.519
JUST ONE‐SIXTH OUR POPULATION ‐‐

11:02.586 --> 11:04.454
HAD COMPLETED 55,000 TESTS.

11:04.521 --> 11:05.956
AND EVEN WELL INTO MARCH,

11:06.022 --> 11:07.390
ALEX AZAR, THE SECRETARY OF

11:07.457 --> 11:09.292
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES,

11:09.359 --> 11:10.494
DIDN'T SEEM TOO CONCERNED ABOUT

11:10.560 --> 11:11.695
THAT DISPARITY ‐‐ BECAUSE WATCH

11:11.761 --> 11:13.463
HOW HE RESPONDED WHEN ASKED

11:13.530 --> 11:14.698
ABOUT IT.

11:14.764 --> 11:16.032
>> BUT MY QUESTION IS, WHY WAS

11:16.099 --> 11:18.134
SOUTH KOREA ABLE TO DO THIS IN A

11:18.201 --> 11:18.735
WEEK AND IT SEEMS TO BE SUCH A

11:18.802 --> 11:20.303
STRUGGLE FOR THE UNITED STATES?

11:20.370 --> 11:22.239
>> WELL, IT'S NOT ABOUT ABILITY,

11:22.305 --> 11:23.106
IT'S ABOUT WHAT THEY NEEDED TO

11:23.173 --> 11:24.875
DO.

11:24.941 --> 11:26.743
THEY HAD AN EXPLOSIVE, IMMEDIATE

11:26.810 --> 11:27.744
OUTBURST IN CLUSTER BECOMING ONE

11:27.811 --> 11:28.945
OF THE WORLD'S EPICENTERS OF THE

11:29.012 --> 11:30.080
DISEASE.

11:30.146 --> 11:31.648
WE ARE NOT THAT.

11:31.715 --> 11:34.317
>> John: "YEAH, WE'RE NOT

11:34.384 --> 11:35.185
SOUTH KOREA.

11:35.252 --> 11:36.553
SOUTH KOREA HAS TESTED A BUNCH

11:36.620 --> 11:37.654
OF PEOPLE FOR CORONAVIRUS AND

11:37.721 --> 11:38.555
FOUND A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WITH

11:38.622 --> 11:39.289
CORONAVIRUS.

11:39.356 --> 11:40.757
WE'VE TESTED ALMOST NO ONE FOR

11:40.824 --> 11:42.058
CORONAVIRUS AND FOUND ALMOST NO

11:42.125 --> 11:44.561
ONE WITH CORONAVIRUS.

11:44.628 --> 11:45.562
TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE,

11:45.629 --> 11:47.230
THE SITUATIONS COULDN'T BE MORE

11:47.297 --> 11:48.164
DIFFERENT, ALTHOUGH, AGAIN, THE

11:48.231 --> 11:49.599
BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE IS

11:49.666 --> 11:53.069
ESSENTIALLY NO KNOWLEDGE."

11:53.136 --> 11:54.738
LOOK, FOR TOO LONG, THE U. S.

11:54.804 --> 11:55.305
RESPONSE SEEMED TO BE

11:55.372 --> 11:56.239
CHARACTERIZED BY AN

11:56.306 --> 11:57.307
ARROGANT BELIEF THAT, FOR SOME

11:57.374 --> 11:58.842
REASON, CORONAVIRUS WAS NEVER

11:58.909 --> 11:59.376
GOING TO COME TO AMERICA,

11:59.442 --> 12:00.777
BECAUSE, I GUESS, IT JUST

12:00.844 --> 12:02.512
WOULDN'T DARE.

12:02.579 --> 12:03.747
AND UNFORTUNATELY, WE'RE

12:03.813 --> 12:04.781
CURRENTLY LIVING IN THE

12:04.848 --> 12:07.150
CONSEQUENCES OF THOSE EARLY

12:07.217 --> 12:08.685
FAILURES, BECAUSE BY MOVING SO

12:08.752 --> 12:10.620
SLOWLY, WE NOW FIND OURSELVES IN

12:10.687 --> 12:11.655
THE MIDST OF SERIOUS GLOBAL

12:11.721 --> 12:12.722
SHORTAGES OF CRUCIAL TESTING

12:12.789 --> 12:15.125
COMPONENTS.

12:15.191 --> 12:16.526
JUST LISTEN TO THE SCIENTIST YOU

12:16.593 --> 12:17.661
SAW EARLIER EXPLAIN THE LENGTHS

12:17.727 --> 12:19.129
HE'S HAD TO GO TO IN ORDER TO

12:19.195 --> 12:21.164
GET WHAT HE NEEDED FROM THE TEST

12:21.231 --> 12:24.868
MANUFACTURER, ROCHE.

12:24.935 --> 12:26.236
>> ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS TO

12:26.303 --> 12:27.470
FIND: THE SINGLE‐USE PLASTIC

12:27.537 --> 12:28.838
TIPS THAT CONTAIN THE CHEMICALS

12:28.905 --> 12:29.940
AND THE SPECIMENS.

12:30.006 --> 12:31.207
>> THIS IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING

12:31.274 --> 12:32.609
FOR, BASICALLY.

12:32.676 --> 12:34.978
WE TWEETED AT ROCHE AND THE

12:35.045 --> 12:37.380
WORLD TO GET THESE THINGS IN,

12:37.447 --> 12:38.615
LIKE YOU WOULD TWEET LIKE DELTA

12:38.682 --> 12:39.349
HAD LOST YOUR BAGS OR SOMETHING

12:39.416 --> 12:41.418
LIKE THAT, RIGHT?

12:41.484 --> 12:43.053
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

12:43.119 --> 12:44.254
YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO TWEET AT

12:44.321 --> 12:45.889
A COMPANY TO GET PARTS FOR

12:45.956 --> 12:46.656
ESSENTIAL LAB EQUIPMENT.

12:46.723 --> 12:47.357
NOT ONLY SHOULD THERE BE A

12:47.424 --> 12:48.692
BETTER PROCESS FOR THAT, BUT

12:48.758 --> 12:49.726
ALSO, THAT'S NOT WHAT TWITTER IS

12:49.793 --> 12:54.631
FOR.

12:54.698 --> 12:55.265
AS WE ALL KNOW, TWITTER IS FOR

12:55.332 --> 12:56.166
EXACTLY THREE THINGS:

12:56.232 --> 12:57.233
POSSUM EVERY HOUR,

12:57.300 --> 12:58.201
CHRISSY TEIGEN, AND

12:58.268 --> 12:58.802
THE OFFICIAL ACCOUNT FOR BEEF.

12:58.868 --> 13:01.071
AND IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW THAT,

13:01.137 --> 13:01.805
YOU ABSOLUTELY SHOULD.

13:01.871 --> 13:02.872
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE YOU CAN

13:02.939 --> 13:03.673
FIND TWEETS LIKE "NICELY DONE,

13:03.740 --> 13:05.475
BEEF," WHICH IS BEEF TWEETING

13:05.542 --> 13:06.743
ENCOURAGEMENT AT BEEF AND IS A

13:06.810 --> 13:07.377
LEVEL OF UNCONDITIONAL SELF‐LOVE

13:07.444 --> 13:09.446
THAT MORE OF US SHOULD ASPIRE

13:09.512 --> 13:14.851
TO.

13:14.918 --> 13:16.620
AND YOU CAN ALSO FIND THEIR

13:16.686 --> 13:18.421
ACTUAL MOTHER'S DAY TWEET, "TO

13:18.488 --> 13:19.756
THE MOMS WHO WRANGLED US, FED

13:19.823 --> 13:21.491
US, AND CARED FOR US, WE WISH

13:21.558 --> 13:22.125
YOU A #HappyMothersDay!" WITH A

13:22.192 --> 13:23.159
PICTURE OF A MOTHER COW AND A

13:23.226 --> 13:23.793
BABY COW WHO WILL BOTH ONE DAY,

13:23.860 --> 13:24.661
PRESUMABLY, BECOME BEEF, AT

13:24.728 --> 13:25.629
WHICH POINT, I'M SURE, THE

13:25.695 --> 13:26.296
ACCOUNT WILL TWEET,

13:26.363 --> 13:28.264
"NICELY DONE, BEEF."

13:28.331 --> 13:30.934
AND IT'S NOT JUST LAB EQUIPMENT.

13:31.001 --> 13:32.435
EVEN THE CHEMICAL REAGENTS

13:32.502 --> 13:36.973
NEEDED TO RUN THE TESTS, OR THE

13:37.040 --> 13:37.507
SWABS THAT IMPALE PEOPLE'S

13:37.574 --> 13:38.074
BRAINS HAVE TO BE SPECIALLY

13:38.141 --> 13:43.580
MANUFACTURED ‐‐ SOMETHING THAT

13:43.647 --> 13:45.448
THE PRESIDENT SEEMED ABSOLUTELY

13:45.515 --> 13:46.049
FASCINATED BY.

13:46.116 --> 13:46.950
>> IT'S A SWAB.

13:47.017 --> 13:47.350
IT LOOKS INNOCENT.

13:47.417 --> 13:48.585
NOT VERY COMPLICATED.

13:48.652 --> 13:49.452
IS IT ‐‐ DOES IT REMIND YOU

13:49.519 --> 13:50.253
OF SOMETHING?

13:50.320 --> 13:52.656
IT REMINDS YOU OF THIS, RIGHT?

13:52.722 --> 13:53.723
ONE IS A SWAB AND ONE IS A

13:53.790 --> 13:54.858
Q‐TIP.

13:54.924 --> 13:57.193
IT'S ACTUALLY DIFFERENT.

13:57.260 --> 13:58.528
IT'S VERY SOPHISTICATED,

13:58.595 --> 14:00.030
ACTUALLY.

14:00.096 --> 14:00.997
BUT IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE ‐‐ SO

14:01.064 --> 14:02.999
THIS IS THE SWAB.

14:03.066 --> 14:04.567
>> John: YEAH, THAT'S THE SWAB.

14:04.634 --> 14:07.537
OBVIOUSLY.

14:07.604 --> 14:11.374
AND THE BACK STORY TO HIM

14:11.441 --> 14:13.076
DECIDING TO PERSONALLY BRING A

14:13.143 --> 14:13.977
Q‐TIP TO THAT BRIEFING TO

14:14.044 --> 14:15.178
PROUDLY SHOW EVERYONE IS SO

14:15.245 --> 14:16.179
PAINFULLY OBVIOUS.

14:16.246 --> 14:16.846
SOMEONE SHOWED HIM THE LONG SWAB

14:16.913 --> 14:17.547
AND HE SAID, "ISN'T THAT A

14:17.614 --> 14:17.814
Q‐TIP?"

14:17.881 --> 14:18.615
AND THEY SAID, "NO, THEY'RE

14:18.682 --> 14:19.082
DIFFERENT."

14:19.149 --> 14:19.749
AND HE SAID, "BUT THEY LOOK THE

14:19.816 --> 14:20.417
SAME."

14:20.483 --> 14:21.951
AND THEY SAID, "NO, THEY DON'T."

14:22.018 --> 14:23.420
AND HE SAID, "BUT THEY'RE BOTH

14:23.486 --> 14:24.521
TALL, THIN, AND WHITE, LIKE ALL

14:24.587 --> 14:25.255
MY GIRLFRIENDS."

14:25.321 --> 14:25.789
AND THEY SAID, "GOOD ONE,

14:25.855 --> 14:27.123
MR. PRESIDENT."

14:27.190 --> 14:27.691
AND HE SAID, "SO WHAT'S THE

14:27.757 --> 14:28.458
PROBLEM?"

14:28.525 --> 14:29.592
AND THEY SAID, "THEY'RE NOT THE

14:29.659 --> 14:30.694
SAME."

14:30.760 --> 14:31.661
AND HE SAID, "BUT THEY'RE BOTH

14:31.728 --> 14:32.395
TALL, THIN, AND WHITE, LIKE ALL

14:32.462 --> 14:33.630
MY GIRLFRIENDS."

14:33.697 --> 14:34.464
AND THEY SAID, "GOOD ONE AGAIN,

14:34.531 --> 14:35.231
MR. PRESIDENT."

14:35.298 --> 14:36.666
AND HE SAID, "SO WHAT GIVES?"

14:36.733 --> 14:37.567
AND THEY SAID, "HERE IS A

14:37.634 --> 14:38.401
Q‐TIP."

14:38.468 --> 14:39.536
AND HE SAID, "THAT ONE IS SHORT,

14:39.602 --> 14:40.770
THIN, AND WHITE, LIKE MY

14:40.837 --> 14:41.337
GIRLFRIENDS WHEN THEY WERE

14:41.404 --> 14:42.205
CHILDREN."

14:42.272 --> 14:43.406
AND THEY SAID, "EXACTLY."

14:43.473 --> 14:43.973
AND HE SAID, "I HAVE TO TELL

14:44.040 --> 14:45.075
AMERICA."

14:45.141 --> 14:47.844
AND THEN HE DID.

14:47.911 --> 14:49.279
BUT SECOND, AND MUCH MORE

14:49.345 --> 14:50.947
IMPORTANTLY, FOR MONTHS, THINGS

14:51.014 --> 14:52.248
LIKE SWABS WERE VERY HARD TO

14:52.315 --> 14:54.084
FIND, AND MULTIPLE GOVERNORS

14:54.150 --> 14:55.018
EXPRESSED DISTRESS THAT THE

14:55.085 --> 14:56.820
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WASN'T

14:56.886 --> 14:58.254
STEPPING IN TO HELP SMOOTH OUT

14:58.321 --> 14:59.556
THE SUPPLY CHAIN.

14:59.622 --> 15:02.025
>> THERE ARE THINGS LIKE

15:02.092 --> 15:03.259
SHORTAGES ON SWABS THAT WE DON'T

15:03.326 --> 15:04.461
HAVE ANYWHERE IN AMERICA.

15:04.527 --> 15:05.495
YOU CAN'T DO THE TESTS WITHOUT

15:05.562 --> 15:06.096
THEM.

15:06.162 --> 15:07.497
>> WE NEED SOME ASSISTANCE FROM

15:07.564 --> 15:08.631
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHEN IT

15:08.698 --> 15:09.799
COMES TO SWABS AND REAGENTS.

15:09.866 --> 15:11.134
>> WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING FOR

15:11.201 --> 15:11.901
TESTING.

15:11.968 --> 15:14.571
IT'S NOT A STRAIGHTFORWARD TEST.

15:14.637 --> 15:15.505
WE DON'T EVEN HAVE ENOUGH SWABS,

15:15.572 --> 15:17.540
BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

15:17.607 --> 15:18.875
>> TO DO THE TESTING, YOU NEED

15:18.942 --> 15:20.376
TESTING EQUIPMENT, YOU NEED

15:20.443 --> 15:24.147
SWABS, YOU NEED VIALS.

15:24.214 --> 15:25.615
AND YOU NEED ALL OF THESE THINGS

15:25.682 --> 15:27.283
AT A CAPACITY THAT DOES NOT NOW

15:27.350 --> 15:28.885
EXIST.

15:28.952 --> 15:30.987
>> John: YEAH, IT'S PRETTY

15:31.054 --> 15:31.521
STRAIGHTFORWARD.

15:31.588 --> 15:33.323
TO DO PROPER TESTING, YOU NEED

15:33.389 --> 15:36.392
PROPER EQUIPMENT.

15:36.459 --> 15:37.360
IT'S WHY GENERALLY YOU PREFER A

15:37.427 --> 15:37.994
DOCTOR WITH A THERMOMETER OVER

15:38.061 --> 15:39.195
ONE WHO THINKS HE JUST HAS A

15:39.262 --> 15:39.829
REAL NATURAL KNACK FOR GUESSING

15:39.896 --> 15:41.698
A PERSON'S TEMPERATURE.

15:41.765 --> 15:43.233
AND IN RESPONSE TO THOSE

15:43.299 --> 15:44.167
CONCERNS, TRUMP INITIALLY

15:44.234 --> 15:45.769
CLAIMED THAT THE PROBLEMS THOSE

15:45.835 --> 15:46.903
GOVERNORS WERE EXPERIENCING

15:46.970 --> 15:48.338
SIMPLY DIDN'T EXIST.

15:48.404 --> 15:49.472
>> WE'RE IN GREAT SHAPE.

15:49.539 --> 15:51.875
IT'S SO EASY TO GET.

15:51.941 --> 15:52.809
REAGENTS AND SWABS ARE SO EASY

15:52.876 --> 15:54.978
TO GET.

15:55.044 --> 15:57.480
>> MR. PRESIDENT, YOU SAID

15:57.547 --> 15:59.082
"SWABS ARE EASY," AND THIS HAS

15:59.149 --> 16:00.717
BEEN SOMETHING THAT HOSPITALS

16:00.784 --> 16:01.351
AND THE STATES HAVE BEEN SAYING

16:01.417 --> 16:01.951
THERE ARE SHORTAGES FOR MORE

16:02.018 --> 16:03.086
THAN A MONTH NOW.

16:03.153 --> 16:03.753
>> WE HAVE MILLIONS OF THEM

16:03.820 --> 16:05.455
COMING IN VERY SOON.

16:05.522 --> 16:07.490
AND MANY OF THEM ALREADY HAVE

16:07.557 --> 16:09.559
BEEN ORDERED, AND THE GOVERNORS

16:09.626 --> 16:10.593
DON'T KNOW QUITE WHERE THEY ARE,

16:10.660 --> 16:11.194
BUT THEY'LL BE FINDING THEM

16:11.261 --> 16:12.996
FAIRLY SOON.

16:13.062 --> 16:13.863
>> John: THEY'LL BE FINDING THEM

16:13.930 --> 16:14.998
FAIRLY SOON?

16:15.064 --> 16:15.799
THESE ARE CRUCIAL MEDICAL

16:15.865 --> 16:17.333
SUPPLIES IN THE MIDST OF A

16:17.400 --> 16:18.501
PANDEMIC, NOT A FUCKING

16:18.568 --> 16:20.770
SCAVENGER HUNT.

16:20.837 --> 16:21.671
"THE SWABS ARE ON ME, WHERE

16:21.738 --> 16:23.273
IMAGINATIONS RUN WILD.

16:23.339 --> 16:24.407
EACH LEVEL I HAVE, THE PAGES ARE

16:24.474 --> 16:25.975
PILED."

16:26.042 --> 16:27.177
WHERE IMAGINATIONS RUN WILD...

16:27.243 --> 16:28.478
AND THE PAGES ARE PILED...

16:28.545 --> 16:29.245
A BOOKSHELF!

16:29.312 --> 16:30.146
A BOOKSHELF!

16:30.213 --> 16:30.747
THE SWABS FOR NATIONWIDE

16:30.814 --> 16:31.481
DIAGNOSTIC TESTING ARE ON A

16:31.548 --> 16:34.017
BOOKSHELF!

16:34.083 --> 16:35.952
I DID IT!

16:36.019 --> 16:36.820
WAIT.

16:36.886 --> 16:38.188
WHY IS THIS A FUCKING GAME?"

16:38.254 --> 16:39.222
NOW, TRUMP DID EVENTUALLY INVOKE

16:39.289 --> 16:40.623
THE DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT

16:40.690 --> 16:41.658
TO RAMP UP MANUFACTURING OF

16:41.724 --> 16:42.592
SWABS ‐‐ BUT HE DID IT LATE, AND

16:42.659 --> 16:44.260
AGAIN, TIMING IS EVERYTHING

16:44.327 --> 16:46.930
HERE.

16:46.996 --> 16:48.598
FROM THE START, THE STORY OF

16:48.665 --> 16:50.200
DIAGNOSTIC TESTING IS OF US

16:50.266 --> 16:52.869
MAKING MISTAKES AND WASTING

16:52.936 --> 16:53.837
VALUABLE TIME IN FIXING THEM,

16:53.903 --> 16:54.938
MEANING TESTS WERE HEAVILY

16:55.004 --> 16:55.872
RATIONED AND OFTEN ONLY GIVEN TO

16:55.939 --> 16:56.840
PEOPLE WHO MET EXTREMELY NARROW

16:56.906 --> 16:59.108
CRITERIA.

16:59.175 --> 17:02.212
WHICH MAKES IT ESPECIALLY

17:02.278 --> 17:03.012
FRUSTRATING THAT, IN HIS VICTORY

17:03.079 --> 17:03.580
LAP THIS WEEK, JARED KUSHNER

17:03.646 --> 17:04.981
SAID THIS:

17:05.048 --> 17:05.748
>> SOMEBODY ASKED ME WHY IT TOOK

17:05.815 --> 17:06.916
SO LONG.

17:06.983 --> 17:08.985
I ACTUALLY SAID, YOU SHOULD LOOK

17:09.052 --> 17:10.753
AT, HOW DID WE DO THIS SO

17:10.820 --> 17:11.054
QUICKLY?

17:11.120 --> 17:11.554
AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS

17:11.621 --> 17:12.589
REALLY ‐‐ IT'S REALLY

17:12.655 --> 17:17.093
EXTRAORDINARY.

17:17.160 --> 17:18.328
>> John: NO, IT FUCKING ISN'T,

17:18.394 --> 17:19.028
JARED.

17:19.095 --> 17:19.662
TAKING MONTHS TO DO WHAT OTHER

17:19.729 --> 17:20.763
COUNTRIES DID IN WEEKS IS NOT

17:20.830 --> 17:21.297
EXTRAORDINARY.

17:21.364 --> 17:21.965
THE ONLY THING THAT'S

17:22.031 --> 17:22.899
EXTRAORDINARY HERE IS THAT THE

17:22.966 --> 17:24.033
MOST PUNCHABLE FACE IN AMERICA

17:24.100 --> 17:25.602
SOMEHOW LOOKS LIKE ITS NEVER

17:25.668 --> 17:27.670
BEEN TOUCHED BY HUMAN HANDS.

17:27.737 --> 17:28.438
DOES IT JUST ABSORB FISTS LIKE A

17:28.504 --> 17:33.243
BOWL OF HEAVY CREAM?

17:33.309 --> 17:34.143
WHAT'S YOUR SECRET, YOU

17:34.210 --> 17:35.612
TRANSLUCENT SOCIOPATH?

17:35.678 --> 17:36.880
AND THE FAILURES IN DIAGNOSTIC

17:36.946 --> 17:37.614
TESTING HAVE LED US TO OUR

17:37.680 --> 17:38.715
CURRENT SITUATION, WHERE WE

17:38.781 --> 17:40.183
STILL DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE

17:40.250 --> 17:41.417
IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE, OR HAVE

17:41.484 --> 17:43.920
HAD, THE CORONAVIRUS.

17:43.987 --> 17:45.388
YOU MAY HAVE EVEN FOUND YOURSELF

17:45.455 --> 17:46.155
WONDERING, "WAIT, DID I HAVE IT

17:46.222 --> 17:47.957
EARLIER THIS YEAR?

17:48.024 --> 17:49.859
I HAD THAT COUGH AND I FELT A

17:49.926 --> 17:52.028
BIT SICK ‐‐ WAS THAT IT?"

17:52.095 --> 17:54.631
WELL, THAT ACTUALLY BRINGS US TO

17:54.697 --> 17:55.398
ANTIBODY TESTS, WHICH DETECT

17:55.465 --> 17:56.032
WHETHER YOUR BODY PRODUCED THE

17:56.099 --> 17:58.601
ANTIBODIES THAT FIGHT THE

17:58.668 --> 17:58.902
CORONAVIRUS.

17:58.968 --> 17:59.736
NOW, FINDING OUT IF PEOPLE HAVE

17:59.802 --> 18:01.671
THOSE IS REALLY HELPFUL FOR

18:01.738 --> 18:03.239
PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS, AS IT

18:03.306 --> 18:04.908
GIVES THEM A BETTER SENSE OF

18:04.974 --> 18:06.843
WHERE THE VIRUS HAS TRAVELED AND

18:06.910 --> 18:08.978
HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE RECOVERED.

18:09.045 --> 18:12.715
BUT ON AN INDIVIDUAL LEVEL, YOU

18:12.782 --> 18:14.250
HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN

18:14.317 --> 18:15.752
TALKING ABOUT ANTIBODIES,

18:15.818 --> 18:17.253
BECAUSE TOO OFTEN, THE SHORTHAND

18:17.320 --> 18:17.854
IS, "IF YOU HAVE THEM, YOU'RE

18:17.921 --> 18:19.088
IMMUNE."

18:19.155 --> 18:21.124
HERE'S GOVERNOR CUOMO DOING

18:21.190 --> 18:22.659
BASICALLY EXACTLY THAT:

18:22.725 --> 18:23.960
>> THAT WOULD MEAN THAT YOU'RE

18:24.027 --> 18:25.695
NO LONGER CONTAGIOUS AND YOU

18:25.762 --> 18:30.266
CAN'T CATCH THE VIRUS BECAUSE

18:30.333 --> 18:30.900
YOU HAVE THE ANTIBODIES IN YOUR

18:30.967 --> 18:31.467
SYSTEM, WHICH MEANS YOU CAN

18:31.534 --> 18:32.669
GET TO WORK, YOU CAN GO BACK TO

18:32.735 --> 18:33.569
SCHOOL, YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU

18:33.636 --> 18:34.871
WANT.

18:34.938 --> 18:35.571
>> John: I CAN DO WHATEVER I

18:35.638 --> 18:36.639
WANT?

18:36.706 --> 18:37.974
THAT SOUNDS GREAT!

18:38.041 --> 18:39.142
I, FOR ONE, WOULD ABSOLUTELY

18:39.208 --> 18:41.077
LOVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE MY

18:41.144 --> 18:43.579
CURRENT PANIC ATTACKS OUTDOORS.

18:43.646 --> 18:46.015
SOMETIMES YOU WANT THE WALLS TO

18:46.082 --> 18:46.449
CLOSE IN ON YOU ONLY

18:46.516 --> 18:48.051
FIGURATIVELY, AND THAT'S OKAY.

18:48.117 --> 18:49.652
AND LOOK, IT WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE

18:49.719 --> 18:53.456
GREAT IF THE PRESENCE OF

18:53.523 --> 18:55.458
ANTIBODIES MEANT THAT YOU WERE

18:55.525 --> 18:56.326
IMMUNE FROM RE‐INFECTION.

18:56.392 --> 18:57.293
AND THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE IT

18:57.360 --> 18:58.661
DOES MEAN THAT ‐‐ BUT WE DON'T

18:58.728 --> 19:00.096
KNOW THAT YET.

19:00.163 --> 19:01.597
BECAUSE COVID‐19 IS STILL SO

19:01.664 --> 19:02.265
NEW, WE'RE STILL NOT SURE

19:02.332 --> 19:04.100
EXACTLY WHAT ANTIBODY LEVELS

19:04.167 --> 19:06.569
MIGHT BE NEEDED TO MAKE YOU

19:06.636 --> 19:07.437
HYPOTHETICALLY IMMUNE, HOW

19:07.503 --> 19:09.372
STRONG THAT IMMUNITY WOULD BE,

19:09.439 --> 19:11.674
OR HOW LONG IT MIGHT EVEN LAST.

19:11.741 --> 19:13.409
AND TO HIS CREDIT, ANTHONY FAUCI

19:13.476 --> 19:14.110
IS CONSTANTLY TRYING TO POINT

19:14.177 --> 19:16.679
THIS OUT.

19:16.746 --> 19:18.548
>> WE DO NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT

19:18.614 --> 19:19.949
AN ANTIBODY TITER MEANS.

19:20.016 --> 19:21.384
I MEAN, THERE IS AN ASSUMPTION,

19:21.451 --> 19:24.721
A REASONABLE ASSUMPTION THAT

19:24.787 --> 19:25.755
WHEN YOU HAVE AN ANTIBODY THAT

19:25.822 --> 19:26.356
YOU ARE PROTECTED AGAINST

19:26.422 --> 19:27.824
RE‐INFECTION.

19:27.890 --> 19:30.159
BUT THAT HAS NOT BEEN PROVEN FOR

19:30.226 --> 19:30.626
THIS PARTICULAR VIRUS.

19:30.693 --> 19:31.828
>> John: YEAH.

19:31.894 --> 19:33.496
AND JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING IS

19:33.563 --> 19:34.931
PROBABLY TRUE DOESN'T MEAN YOU

19:34.998 --> 19:36.966
CAN AUTOMATICALLY ASSUME IT IS.

19:37.033 --> 19:38.067
I MEAN, DID NINTENDO CREATE AND

19:38.134 --> 19:39.235
RELEASE COVID‐19 AS PART OF

19:39.302 --> 19:40.236
A PLAN TO BOOST SALES OF

19:40.303 --> 19:41.537
"ANIMAL CROSSING" TO A

19:41.604 --> 19:47.143
NEWLY CAPTIVE AUDIENCE?

19:47.210 --> 19:48.511
WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE, DO WE?

19:48.578 --> 19:49.145
WE ALL BASICALLY AGREE, BUT WE

19:49.212 --> 19:50.380
CAN'T SAY IT WITH CERTAINTY...

19:50.446 --> 19:51.180
YET.

19:51.247 --> 19:52.515
SO ANTIBODY TESTS COULD ACTUALLY

19:52.582 --> 19:53.750
MEAN SIGNIFICANTLY LESS RIGHT

19:53.816 --> 19:54.717
NOW THAN PEOPLE UNDERSTANDABLY

19:54.784 --> 19:58.287
WANT THEM TO.

19:58.354 --> 20:00.023
AND THAT IS ASSUMING THEY'RE

20:00.089 --> 20:00.823
EVEN ACCURATE ‐‐ WHICH IS NOT

20:00.890 --> 20:01.824
NECESSARILY THE CASE.

20:01.891 --> 20:03.192
BECAUSE WHILE THE FDA CLEARLY

20:03.259 --> 20:05.094
SLOWED THINGS DOWN FAR TOO MUCH

20:05.161 --> 20:06.362
WHEN IT CAME TO DIAGNOSTIC

20:06.429 --> 20:08.231
TESTS, THEY OVERCORRECTED HARD

20:08.297 --> 20:10.299
WHEN IT CAME TO ANTIBODY TESTS,

20:10.366 --> 20:12.101
BASICALLY GIVING A GREEN LIGHT

20:12.168 --> 20:13.936
TO MAKE TESTS WITH ESSENTIALLY

20:14.003 --> 20:15.405
NO OVERSIGHT.

20:15.471 --> 20:18.374
AND AS A RESULT, THERE ARE NOW

20:18.441 --> 20:19.075
OVER 150 OF THEM ON THE MARKET,

20:19.142 --> 20:21.010
NONE OF WHICH ARE FDA APPROVED.

20:21.077 --> 20:23.613
IN FACT, ONLY TEN ARE EVEN FDA

20:23.679 --> 20:25.815
AUTHORIZED, WHICH MEANS LITTLE

20:25.882 --> 20:27.316
MORE THAN THAT SOME FORMS HAVE

20:27.383 --> 20:28.951
BEEN SUBMITTED.

20:29.018 --> 20:30.653
AND RESEARCHERS WHO'VE LOOKED AT

20:30.720 --> 20:31.554
TESTS HAVE FOUND THAT, WHILE A

20:31.621 --> 20:34.924
FEW ARE RELIABLE, MANY, MANY,

20:34.991 --> 20:36.959
MANY MORE ARE NOT.

20:37.026 --> 20:40.797
>> WE HAVE THE WILD, WILD WEST

20:40.863 --> 20:41.864
FOR TESTING RIGHT NOW.

20:41.931 --> 20:42.732
THE FDA HAS ALL BUT GIVEN UP ITS

20:42.799 --> 20:43.499
OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY FOR

20:43.566 --> 20:45.835
TESTS WE HAVE ON THE MARKET.

20:45.902 --> 20:47.336
MANY OF THEM ARE NOTHING SHORT

20:47.403 --> 20:47.870
OF A DISASTER.

20:47.937 --> 20:49.072
RIGHT NOW, IF YOU WERE TO TEST

20:49.138 --> 20:50.273
FOR ANTIBODY IN MOST PLACES IN

20:50.339 --> 20:51.441
THE UNITED STATES, OVER HALF THE

20:51.507 --> 20:53.676
TESTS WOULD BE FALSE POSITIVES.

20:53.743 --> 20:56.446
>> John: THINK ABOUT WHAT HE

20:56.512 --> 20:58.581
JUST SAID THERE: MANY OF THE

20:58.648 --> 21:01.551
TESTS ARE GARBAGE, AND OVER HALF

21:01.617 --> 21:02.251
OF THE POSITIVE TEST RESULTS

21:02.318 --> 21:03.219
RIGHT NOW WOULD BE WRONG.

21:03.286 --> 21:04.153
AT THAT POINT, WHY NOT JUST HAVE

21:04.220 --> 21:04.954
PEOPLE GO TO A "GUESS YOUR

21:05.021 --> 21:05.988
CORONAVIRUS ANTIBODY LEVEL"

21:06.055 --> 21:09.392
BOOTH?

21:09.459 --> 21:10.960
JUST FIVE BUCKS AND JIM HERE

21:11.027 --> 21:11.360
WILL GUESS YOURS.

21:11.427 --> 21:12.328
IF HE'S WRONG ‐‐ AND THERE'S

21:12.395 --> 21:12.929
BASICALLY NO WAY OF KNOWING IF

21:12.995 --> 21:14.030
HE IS ‐‐ THEN YOU GET A STUFFED

21:14.097 --> 21:15.231
GIRAFFE.

21:15.298 --> 21:16.899
SO HERE WE ARE, MONTHS INTO THIS

21:16.966 --> 21:18.835
CRISIS, STILL BADLY IN NEED OF

21:18.901 --> 21:20.670
MORE TESTING ‐‐ BOTH DIAGNOSTIC

21:20.736 --> 21:22.505
AND ANTIBODY ‐‐ AND YET, WITHOUT

21:22.572 --> 21:25.308
ANY CLEAR, COORDINATED STRATEGY

21:25.374 --> 21:27.009
FOR HOW TO BEST ACHIEVE THAT.

21:27.076 --> 21:28.878
AND NOT ONLY HAS THE PRESIDENT

21:28.945 --> 21:30.813
REPEATEDLY LIED ABOUT THE

21:30.880 --> 21:31.781
AVAILABILITY OF OUR TESTS, HE'S

21:31.848 --> 21:33.316
STILL FUCKING DOING IT.

21:33.382 --> 21:35.051
RIGHT NOW, HE'S SAYING OUR

21:35.118 --> 21:35.685
TESTING CAPACITY IS SUFFICIENT

21:35.751 --> 21:38.855
TO REOPEN THE COUNTRY.

21:38.921 --> 21:39.522
WHICH, REMEMBER, ACCORDING TO

21:39.589 --> 21:41.858
EXPERTS, IT ISN'T.

21:41.924 --> 21:43.493
WE'RE DOING AROUND 200,000 TESTS

21:43.559 --> 21:44.026
A DAY WHEN WE LIKELY NEED

21:44.093 --> 21:47.330
MILLIONS.

21:47.396 --> 21:48.564
AND YET, ON TUESDAY, THE

21:48.631 --> 21:49.298
PRESIDENT INSISTED THAT WE WERE

21:49.365 --> 21:50.800
JUST ABOUT THERE.

21:50.867 --> 21:52.935
>> SOME HEALTH EXPERTS SAY THE

21:53.002 --> 21:54.904
U.S. NEEDS 5 MILLION TESTS PER

21:54.971 --> 21:56.572
DAY BY JUNE IN ORDER TO SAFELY

21:56.639 --> 21:58.708
REOPEN.

21:58.774 --> 22:00.076
YOU UNVEILED A PLAN YESTERDAY

22:00.143 --> 22:01.477
THAT WILL INCREASE TESTING, BUT

22:01.544 --> 22:02.078
NOT BY THAT MUCH.

22:02.145 --> 22:03.146
WHY NOT?

22:03.212 --> 22:04.247
AND CAN YOU GET TO THAT

22:04.313 --> 22:05.581
BENCHMARK?

22:05.648 --> 22:06.949
>> WELL, IT WILL INCREASE IT,

22:07.016 --> 22:07.550
AND IT'LL INCREASE IT BY MUCH

22:07.617 --> 22:08.251
MORE THAN THAT IN THE VERY NEAR

22:08.317 --> 22:09.185
FUTURE.

22:09.252 --> 22:10.753
>> DID I HEAR YOU SAYING YOU'RE

22:10.820 --> 22:11.287
CONFIDENT YOU CAN SURPASS

22:11.354 --> 22:12.722
5 MILLION TESTS PER DAY?

22:12.788 --> 22:13.589
IS THAT ‐‐

22:13.656 --> 22:14.991
>> OH, WELL, WE'RE GOING TO BE

22:15.057 --> 22:16.192
THERE VERY SOON.

22:16.259 --> 22:18.161
IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS, IT

22:18.227 --> 22:19.428
COULD BE THAT WE'RE GETTING VERY

22:19.495 --> 22:21.430
CLOSE.

22:21.497 --> 22:22.632
>> John: BUT THE THING IS, WE'RE

22:22.698 --> 22:23.266
NOT VERY CLOSE.

22:23.332 --> 22:26.836
IN FACT, WE'RE NOT CLOSE AT ALL.

22:26.903 --> 22:28.271
AND THAT IS A LIE THAT HE'S

22:28.337 --> 22:29.172
GOING TO GET INSTANTLY CAUGHT

22:29.238 --> 22:29.872
ON.

22:29.939 --> 22:30.873
IT'S LIKE SOMEONE CLAIMING THEY

22:30.940 --> 22:31.674
HAVE A 10‐INCH PENIS IMMEDIATELY

22:31.741 --> 22:32.375
BEFORE TAKING OFF THEIR

22:32.441 --> 22:35.211
UNDERWEAR.

22:35.278 --> 22:36.479
"OKAY, THAT'S AN IMPRESSIVE

22:36.546 --> 22:38.181
CLAIM, BUT IF YOU'RE LYING, I'M

22:38.247 --> 22:39.282
GONG TO BE VERY DISAPPOINTED,

22:39.348 --> 22:40.550
AND A LITTLE ANGRY THAT YOU

22:40.616 --> 22:43.286
THOUGHT I WOULDN'T NOTICE."

22:43.352 --> 22:46.422
AND SURE ENOUGH, THAT VERY DAY,

22:46.489 --> 22:47.290
TRUMP'S ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF

22:47.356 --> 22:48.824
HEALTH TOLD REPORTERS, "THERE IS

22:48.891 --> 22:50.026
ABSOLUTELY NO WAY ON EARTH, ON

22:50.092 --> 22:52.228
THIS PLANET OR ANY OTHER PLANET,

22:52.295 --> 22:53.930
THAT WE CAN DO 20 MILLION TESTS

22:53.996 --> 22:54.664
A DAY OR EVEN 5 MILLION TESTS A

22:54.730 --> 22:57.200
DAY."

22:57.266 --> 22:59.068
AND LOOK, SOME CONFUSION IS

22:59.135 --> 23:00.937
INEVITABLE WHEN A NEW DISEASE

23:01.003 --> 23:02.004
STARTS SPREADING ITS WAY AROUND

23:02.071 --> 23:02.738
THE WORLD.

23:02.805 --> 23:04.173
AND IT'S NOT LIKE ROLLING OUT

23:04.240 --> 23:05.041
TESTING ON THIS KIND OF A SCALE

23:05.107 --> 23:06.609
WAS EVER GOING TO BE EASY.

23:06.676 --> 23:07.610
BUT AGAIN AND AGAIN, THE PEOPLE

23:07.677 --> 23:09.645
IN CHARGE FAILED TO PREPARE FOR

23:09.712 --> 23:10.846
THE WORST‐CASE SCENARIO AND HAVE

23:10.913 --> 23:12.315
BEEN SLOW IN FIXING MISTAKES,

23:12.381 --> 23:14.951
ALL OF WHICH MEANS, IN MAY,

23:15.017 --> 23:16.586
WE'RE STILL PLAYING CATCH‐UP IN

23:16.652 --> 23:18.321
THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC, WHICH

23:18.387 --> 23:19.822
IN TURN MEANS THOUSANDS UPON

23:19.889 --> 23:22.158
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DYING

23:22.225 --> 23:23.793
PREVENTABLE DEATHS.

23:23.859 --> 23:25.995
SO IF THIS IS A GREAT SUCCESS

23:26.062 --> 23:28.364
STORY FOR ANYONE, IT'S THE

23:28.431 --> 23:31.267
FUCKING CORONAVIRUS.

23:31.334 --> 23:32.468
WE NEED TO SCALE UP TESTS

23:32.535 --> 23:33.703
MASSIVELY AND RIGHT AWAY.

23:33.769 --> 23:36.138
BECAUSE IF WE WANT TO RETURN TO

23:36.205 --> 23:37.940
THE WORLD WE'RE USED TO ‐‐ ONE

23:38.007 --> 23:40.109
WITH SPORTS, RESTAURANTS, HUGS,

23:40.176 --> 23:41.477
AND TURNING DOWN PARTY

23:41.544 --> 23:43.312
INVITATIONS BECAUSE IT'S RAINING

23:43.379 --> 23:44.013
AND NOT BECAUSE YOU MIGHT DIE ‐‐

23:44.080 --> 23:47.350
TESTING IS HOW WE GET THERE.

23:47.416 --> 23:49.485
AND THAT'S A MESSAGE THAT SHOULD

23:49.552 --> 23:50.453
REALLY UNITE EVERYONE IN THIS

23:50.519 --> 23:51.254
COUNTRY.

23:51.320 --> 23:52.722
FROM THE PEOPLE AT HOME, WORRIED

23:52.788 --> 23:54.190
ABOUT THE POTENTIAL LOSS OF

23:54.257 --> 23:55.825
LIFE, TO THE PEOPLE OUT

23:55.891 --> 23:57.226
PROTESTING SOCIAL DISTANCING

23:57.293 --> 23:58.261
BECAUSE THEY THINK IT'S TOO HIGH

23:58.327 --> 23:59.462
A PRICE TO PAY, TO ALEX JONES

23:59.528 --> 24:00.696
PREPARING TO BARBECUE HIS

24:00.763 --> 24:02.198
NEIGHBORS, WE COULD ALL STAND TO

24:02.265 --> 24:06.902
LISTEN TO THE ADVICE OF OUR

24:06.969 --> 24:09.639
ONE OF OUR BRAVEST, BRIGHTEST

24:09.705 --> 24:10.406
>> TESTING, TESTING, TESTING,

24:10.473 --> 24:11.841
TESTING, TESTING, TESTING!

24:11.907 --> 24:15.144
TESTING!

24:15.211 --> 24:18.180
[SCREAMS]

24:18.247 --> 24:19.181
>> John: THAT GUY WAS REALLY

24:19.248 --> 24:19.949
AHEAD OF HIS TIME.

24:20.016 --> 24:24.353
AND NOW, THIS.

24:24.420 --> 24:25.121
>> Announcer: AND NOW, EVEN

24:25.187 --> 24:27.056
DURING A PANDEMIC, FLORIDA CAN'T

24:27.123 --> 24:27.823
HELP BUT BE FLORIDA.

24:27.890 --> 24:30.926
>> A JUDGE IN FLORIDA WITH A

24:30.993 --> 24:32.595
LETTER EXPRESSING HIS

24:32.662 --> 24:33.896
FRUSTRATIONS WITH RECENT

24:33.963 --> 24:34.964
APPEARANCES INCLUDING A

24:35.031 --> 24:36.098
SHIRTLESS MALE LAWYER AND A

24:36.165 --> 24:39.101
FEMALE SHOWING UP TO VIRTUAL

24:39.168 --> 24:40.703
COURT FROM UNDER COVERS IN BED.

24:40.770 --> 24:44.073
>> IT ONLY IN FLORIDA,

24:44.140 --> 24:44.473
PROTECTIVE MASKS.

24:44.540 --> 24:47.476
>> ONLY EMPLOY DID YOU UCI

24:47.543 --> 24:48.477
MANATEE, AND ALLIGATOR TOGETHER

24:48.544 --> 24:51.213
DURING QUARANTINE.

24:51.280 --> 24:55.151
SPEAK WITH THE STATE OF FLORIDA

24:55.217 --> 24:58.421
SAID THE BW EAT WAS AN ESSENTIAL

24:58.487 --> 24:58.688
BUSINESS.

24:58.754 --> 25:01.557
>> ONLY IN FLORIDA AT WHAT A MAN

25:01.624 --> 25:03.225
TO HAVE CORONAVIRUS.

25:03.292 --> 25:06.962
>> WHY DOES THIS ALWAYS HAPPEN

25:07.029 --> 25:07.263
IN FLORIDA?

25:07.330 --> 25:09.565
>> INO, RIGHT?

25:09.632 --> 25:12.535
ALWAYS FLORIDA.

25:12.601 --> 25:14.770
FLORIDA.

25:14.837 --> 25:16.172
A LAWYER!

25:16.238 --> 25:22.278
>> PUT YOUR SHIRT ON.

25:22.345 --> 25:23.179
>> John: MOVING ON.

25:23.245 --> 25:24.347
BEFORE WE GO, I JUST WANTED TO

25:24.413 --> 25:25.014
SAY A QUICK WORD ABOUT PETS.

25:25.081 --> 25:25.681
AS YOU MAY REMEMBER, A COUPLE OF

25:25.748 --> 25:26.315
WEEKS AGO, WE DISCUSSED THE FACT

25:26.382 --> 25:27.283
WENDY WILLIAMS HAS CATS THAT

25:27.350 --> 25:28.317
NEVER COME WHEN SHE CALLS THEM,

25:28.384 --> 25:29.218
AND I MENTIONED THAT I HAVE 28

25:29.285 --> 25:30.119
CATS WHO IGNORE ME TOO.

25:30.186 --> 25:30.853
I'LL SHOW YOU:

SEE?

25:58.647 --> 25:59.982
NOTHING.

26:00.049 --> 26:02.017
WE LOVE ANIMALS ON THIS SHOW,

26:02.084 --> 26:04.120
AND IT RECENTLY CAME TO OUR

26:04.186 --> 26:04.687
ATTENTION THAT SOME OF YOUR

26:04.754 --> 26:05.321
CATS, IN PARTICULAR, RECIPROCATE

26:05.388 --> 26:07.256
OUR INTEREST.

26:07.323 --> 26:08.190
JUST TAKE A LOOK AT ONE WATCHING

26:08.257 --> 26:10.092
OUR SHOW A FEW WEEKS AGO.

26:10.159 --> 26:11.494
>> TAKES AN INTIMATE BOAT TRIP

26:11.560 --> 26:13.696
WITH THEIR TWO BEST FRIENDS TO

26:13.763 --> 26:14.730
KILL THEIR THIRD BEST FRIEND.

26:14.797 --> 26:15.998
I JUST HOPE THAT TONY WASHED HIS

26:16.065 --> 26:17.633
HANDS FOR TWO HAPPY BIRTHDAYS.

26:17.700 --> 26:19.468
AND IF YOU ARE WORRIED THAT YOU

26:19.535 --> 26:21.670
MIGHT BE RUNNING OUT OF CONTENT

26:21.737 --> 26:23.406
THAT MIGHT HELP YOU MENTALLY

26:23.472 --> 26:25.875
ESCAPE, YOU ARE IN LUCK.
