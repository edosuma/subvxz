WEBVTT

00:02.170 --> 00:03.380
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

00:03.546 --> 00:06.091
<i>Monsters are coming, Mr. Mayor,</i>

00:06.257 --> 00:08.593
who will cleanse this city.

00:08.927 --> 00:09.969
If you sell me your company,

00:10.136 --> 00:13.598
I will give you the name of the man
who killed your parents.

00:13.807 --> 00:14.808
Who the hell are you?

00:14.974 --> 00:17.894
I'm Bruce's friend,
and you're a piece of gutter trash.

00:18.061 --> 00:20.271
You think that little minx
is gonna tell you something, do you?

00:20.438 --> 00:22.440
Getting information
out of a girl like that

00:22.607 --> 00:25.527
requires a level of deception
that you do not yet possess.

00:25.694 --> 00:27.112
You're under arrest!

00:27.278 --> 00:28.780
May I ask what the charge is?

00:28.863 --> 00:30.949
The kidnapping
and torture of Aubrey James.

00:31.449 --> 00:32.492
These were Miss Kringle's.

00:32.784 --> 00:35.286
A man with nothing to love is free.

00:35.537 --> 00:37.539
Hey, Parks. You did good today.

00:39.499 --> 00:43.294
Eduardo Flamingo killed Officer Parks
before they could get him into lock-up.

00:44.504 --> 00:47.757
Bruce Wayne will die,
and his company will be ours.

00:47.924 --> 00:51.553
<i>Everything is ready.
The brothers' arrival is imminent.</i>

00:51.720 --> 00:54.597
<i>Gotham will be redeemed in blood.</i>

01:04.482 --> 01:06.651
Please! Please don't hurt me!

01:06.776 --> 01:07.944
Shut up!

02:01.331 --> 02:02.499
Huh!

02:05.877 --> 02:07.462
Forget your umbrella?

02:08.797 --> 02:10.673
<i>Thought visiting hours were over.</i>

02:11.549 --> 02:15.887
What are rules to the man
who arrested the Mayor of Gotham?

02:20.266 --> 02:23.436
Any chance you're going to tell me
what this little visit is about?

02:24.020 --> 02:26.231
Tomorrow's hearing, perhaps?

02:26.397 --> 02:27.649
You're here to gloat.

02:27.816 --> 02:30.610
Does the name Katherine Parks
mean anything to you?

02:33.279 --> 02:35.073
No. Can't say it does.

02:37.742 --> 02:39.577
I'm gonna be there tomorrow.

02:41.246 --> 02:43.122
And I'll watch them put you away.

02:47.585 --> 02:50.046
Always a pleasure, Detective.

02:57.428 --> 02:58.972
- Hey.
- Hi.

03:04.727 --> 03:06.771
You're soaking wet.

03:10.108 --> 03:11.568
Do you wanna talk about it?

03:13.111 --> 03:14.863
Katherine Parks was 23.

03:17.532 --> 03:18.950
On the force a year.

03:21.202 --> 03:23.037
And today, we put her in the ground

03:23.830 --> 03:25.456
because when I had the chance,

03:26.165 --> 03:28.543
- I didn't do the only sensible thing.
- Jim--

03:28.793 --> 03:30.795
An assassin kills four cops,

03:31.629 --> 03:33.548
dares me to pull the trigger, and I don't.

03:35.633 --> 03:36.718
Explain that to me.

03:36.885 --> 03:39.470
That man was your prisoner.
You didn't have a choice.

03:40.179 --> 03:41.472
I had a choice.

03:42.056 --> 03:45.935
Yes. To uphold the law
or to become a murderer.

03:46.102 --> 03:47.145
You made the right one.

03:47.312 --> 03:49.522
You think Katherine Parks
feels the same way?

03:49.814 --> 03:51.107
What about her family?

03:53.985 --> 03:55.695
I went to see Galavan today.

03:57.155 --> 03:58.197
And?

03:58.364 --> 04:00.992
You're asking did I get the guards
to turn the cameras off?

04:01.159 --> 04:03.745
No. But they would have.

04:03.912 --> 04:07.332
Galavan as good as killed Parks, Essen,
and a dozen other cops,

04:07.498 --> 04:08.875
and yet he sits there.

04:09.459 --> 04:10.877
Smiling. Breathing.

04:11.044 --> 04:14.547
And tomorrow, Aubrey James is going
in front of the grand jury

04:14.714 --> 04:17.175
and telling them that he was kidnapped
and tortured by Galavan.

04:17.675 --> 04:19.802
He's gonna be put away for a long time.

04:19.969 --> 04:21.262
Maybe.

04:22.513 --> 04:24.140
Just the way he acted...

04:24.849 --> 04:27.143
It wasn't a man looking
at a decade in prison.

04:29.604 --> 04:30.688
I have a bad feeling.

04:30.855 --> 04:32.690
Jim, it's over.

04:33.608 --> 04:35.026
You did good.

04:37.528 --> 04:39.864
Now, come to bed. Doctor's orders.

05:03.221 --> 05:04.389
Where am I?

05:06.349 --> 05:07.725
Who are you?

05:08.184 --> 05:09.978
The day of reckoning is at hand.

05:10.603 --> 05:14.524
The blood of the nine
shall wash away the sin.

05:16.484 --> 05:17.860
Wait! Please!

05:18.027 --> 05:19.946
And Gotham will be cleansed.

05:33.084 --> 05:34.836
This isn't gonna work.

05:34.961 --> 05:39.674
This girl is a world-class liar
from a family of world-class liars.

05:39.841 --> 05:42.260
She'll see through you. Or her uncle will.

05:42.427 --> 05:43.803
Both very possible.

05:44.554 --> 05:45.763
And?

05:47.140 --> 05:50.810
Bruce, they're playing nice with you
because they think you trust them.

05:51.894 --> 05:54.439
Once they see you don't,
it'll get ugly fast.

05:54.605 --> 05:57.233
- Your logic is flawless, Selina.
- It's not too late--

05:57.400 --> 06:00.278
If there's even a chance Galavan knows
who killed my parents, I have to take it.

06:02.613 --> 06:04.449
I've told Alfred
I have fencing practice after school.

06:04.699 --> 06:06.451
It should buy us some time if we need it.

06:06.617 --> 06:07.618
Hey.

06:09.120 --> 06:11.289
The best liars always tell the truth.

06:11.956 --> 06:13.541
Something to remember.

06:13.708 --> 06:14.959
Thank you.

06:18.588 --> 06:20.089
That's her car. You'd be--

06:26.971 --> 06:28.931
Alvarez, call the morgue,

06:29.098 --> 06:31.642
see if any bodies turned up
matching Gertrude Kapelput.

06:31.809 --> 06:33.936
She didn't just vanish.
Galavan killed her.

06:34.103 --> 06:35.104
I did that yesterday.

06:35.313 --> 06:36.981
And you're gonna do it again today.

06:37.523 --> 06:39.108
I got my own cases, Gordon.

06:39.275 --> 06:41.486
Turn up anything on that symbol
we found in the penthouse?

06:41.652 --> 06:44.280
No. I'm waiting for Father Mike
up at St. Bart's.

06:44.447 --> 06:46.074
Sent him a picture of the cassock too.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.659
He's up on all that religious mumbo-jumbo.

06:48.826 --> 06:50.578
What exactly are we after here?

06:50.745 --> 06:53.498
Something tying Galavan
to the murders of Essen, Parks,

06:53.664 --> 06:54.832
any of the people he killed.

06:55.333 --> 06:58.252
Not to state the obvious, Jim,
but the guy is going to jail.

06:59.045 --> 07:00.254
I went to see him last night.

07:00.421 --> 07:02.715
Yeah? You get the guards
to turn off the camera?

07:02.924 --> 07:04.509
The look on his face, Harvey.

07:05.551 --> 07:06.761
I don't know. I can't describe it.

07:07.095 --> 07:08.429
You gotta be kidding me.

07:10.181 --> 07:13.643
Guy gets stabbed, I thought we'd have
at least a week of peace.

07:13.810 --> 07:16.854
Hey, Cap! How you doing?
Did you get my flowers?

07:18.231 --> 07:19.357
Captain. How you feeling?

07:19.732 --> 07:21.192
Five-by-five.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.903
Damn Doc would've had me in bed
a week if I'd have let him.

07:24.112 --> 07:25.154
Got something for you.

07:25.321 --> 07:27.532
Unis found a dead body down by the port.

07:27.698 --> 07:28.741
Throat cut from ear-to-ear.

07:29.158 --> 07:31.661
The vic's a career dirtbag,
but the work's the same.

07:31.828 --> 07:34.205
Sir. If it's all the same,
I'd like to stay on Galavan.

07:34.372 --> 07:38.167
It isn't. Galavan's cooked,
so you're back in the rotation. What?

07:38.417 --> 07:40.294
I just feel like
we're missing something, sir.

07:40.545 --> 07:43.923
Yeah, some piece of the puzzle
that's gonna come back and bite us.

07:44.090 --> 07:45.216
Just give me a few more days.

07:45.383 --> 07:48.386
Answer's no.
Be pissed, but it's for your own good.

07:49.428 --> 07:50.596
Oh, and, uh...

07:51.681 --> 07:53.057
I'm sorry about Parks.

07:53.724 --> 07:54.976
She deserved better.

07:56.853 --> 07:58.396
Yo! Jim.

07:58.896 --> 08:00.231
Message from Father Mike.

08:00.398 --> 08:04.026
That symbol is from something called
the Order of St. Dumas.

08:04.193 --> 08:05.945
They used to have an abbey downtown.

08:06.571 --> 08:08.406
Barnes just told me to lay off of Galavan.

08:08.614 --> 08:10.074
Oh, well, then you probably don't care

08:10.241 --> 08:13.411
that the mayor's office
tried to buy the abbey last week.

08:13.744 --> 08:14.745
Galavan tried to buy it?

08:14.912 --> 08:16.831
Yeah. Some urban development nonsense.

08:16.998 --> 08:20.418
The new owners said no.
It's a Chinese slap-slap joint now.

08:24.964 --> 08:26.257
Hell with it. You got the address?

08:26.424 --> 08:28.426
Yep. Let's go get lucky.

09:10.343 --> 09:11.636
Your uncle made me an offer.

09:11.802 --> 09:13.262
The name of my parents' killer

09:13.429 --> 09:15.806
in exchange for selling him my shares
in Wayne Enterprises.

09:16.307 --> 09:17.475
I said no.

09:17.934 --> 09:19.352
But circumstances have changed.

09:20.311 --> 09:21.812
You're going to sell?

09:22.813 --> 09:24.148
- No.
- Then--

09:24.315 --> 09:26.442
Your uncle was arrested
and his assets are frozen.

09:26.984 --> 09:30.488
Tell him I'll pay for his defense.
In exchange, he gives me the name.

09:31.280 --> 09:32.782
You're taking advantage of him.

09:32.990 --> 09:35.159
I have something he needs,
he has something I need. That's all.

09:35.368 --> 09:37.954
Do you believe
what people are saying about him?

09:38.496 --> 09:40.039
I don't care what people say.

09:41.457 --> 09:43.501
My father was investigating
Wayne Enterprises,

09:43.668 --> 09:45.127
then he and my mother were killed.

09:45.878 --> 09:47.922
Last year,
I investigated Wayne Enterprises,

09:48.089 --> 09:49.340
and someone tried to kill Alfred.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.175
Either I find out who killed my parents

09:51.342 --> 09:53.427
and stop whatever's happening
at my own company,

09:53.594 --> 09:54.595
or I'm dead.

09:56.305 --> 09:57.807
I need that name.

09:58.224 --> 10:01.394
The grand jury hearing is today.
He's going to be cleared.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.437
What if he's not? What then?

10:04.522 --> 10:06.232
<i>Silver, get him
to tell you the name,</i>

10:06.816 --> 10:09.694
and I will make sure he has
the best defense money can buy. I promise.

10:09.860 --> 10:11.195
You think he's guilty.

10:12.655 --> 10:14.198
Why would you believe anything he says?

10:15.408 --> 10:16.867
Because it would come from you.

10:19.036 --> 10:21.163
If you bring me the name,
I'll know it's real.

10:37.054 --> 10:38.222
Do you mean that?

10:48.816 --> 10:50.651
I'll call you after I talk to him.

11:00.536 --> 11:02.079
You still gotta get the name.

11:02.747 --> 11:04.665
I will. I'm late for school.

11:20.556 --> 11:21.891
Not yet.

11:34.737 --> 11:36.530
You sure about this?

11:36.989 --> 11:39.325
Doesn't look much like a massage parlor.

11:39.492 --> 11:41.118
Maybe there's another entrance?

11:52.421 --> 11:53.464
Get these girls out of here.

11:53.631 --> 11:55.383
Come on. Come on. Come on.

11:59.804 --> 12:01.180
G.C.P.D.!

12:01.555 --> 12:03.682
Sir?

12:34.713 --> 12:35.714
Stop!

12:39.260 --> 12:40.678
Drop the knife.

12:42.805 --> 12:44.181
The day of reckoning is at hand.

12:45.182 --> 12:47.184
And the blood of nine
shall wash away the sin.

12:47.518 --> 12:51.355
Uh-huh? Who are you?
What's your connection to Galavan?

12:51.897 --> 12:53.524
And Gotham shall be cleansed.

12:55.484 --> 12:57.236
Hey! Hey!

13:04.368 --> 13:07.204
The girls at the parlor say
they saw at least six monks.

13:08.456 --> 13:09.665
Uh-huh?

13:10.040 --> 13:12.751
They have to be part
of this same Order of St. Dumas.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.421
Bullock's contact says they're penitents.

13:15.880 --> 13:18.215
Yeah. I forgot my dictionary in my purse.

13:18.382 --> 13:20.593
They believed
in purification through pain.

13:21.469 --> 13:22.470
Blood.

13:23.387 --> 13:25.556
They were big in the old days in Gotham.

13:26.015 --> 13:28.184
Then about a hundred years ago, vanished.

13:28.642 --> 13:31.061
It was their crest we found
in Galavan's penthouse.

13:31.729 --> 13:33.689
And now they're back
and they're pissed off

13:33.856 --> 13:36.525
that their home is
a high-end rub and tug joint.

13:36.692 --> 13:37.693
<i>Fine!</i>

13:37.860 --> 13:40.529
Gather what you have
and give it to Alvarez.

13:40.696 --> 13:43.365
Captain, these monks could be the key
to whatever Galavan is planning.

13:43.532 --> 13:46.494
As I recall, Detective,
I already gave you a case.

13:46.660 --> 13:49.538
And I expressly told you
to move away from Galavan.

13:49.705 --> 13:51.081
The dead guy at the ports?

13:51.248 --> 13:53.417
<i>He attacked a woman across town yesterday.</i>

13:53.584 --> 13:56.504
In her statement,
she said her attacker was pulled off

13:56.670 --> 13:58.088
by a man dressed like a monk.

13:59.256 --> 14:01.467
Does the universe
normally like you this much, Detective?

14:01.634 --> 14:02.635
First time.

14:02.801 --> 14:04.553
<i>All right. Say they're the same monks.</i>

14:04.720 --> 14:08.766
Why would they kill a bunch of bankers
and some nobody street thug?

14:08.974 --> 14:12.520
The monk said, "The blood of the nine
shall wash away the sin."

14:13.604 --> 14:15.105
It's obviously some sort of ritual.

14:15.272 --> 14:18.609
And if Galavan is connected,
what does he stand to gain?

14:18.776 --> 14:19.860
I don't know.

14:20.027 --> 14:21.820
We have to find a monk
and get him to talk.

14:21.987 --> 14:24.949
Well, considering what this last one did,
that might not be so easy.

14:25.115 --> 14:26.283
Captain, it's no coincidence

14:26.450 --> 14:29.453
that this is happening
just as Galavan's about to stand trial.

14:29.620 --> 14:32.289
Whatever it is, it's going down today.

14:32.456 --> 14:33.749
The blood of the nine.

14:34.083 --> 14:35.376
<i>Five are already dead.</i>

14:37.127 --> 14:38.212
Okay.

14:38.379 --> 14:41.465
But I still want you at the grand jury
to hear James' testimony.

14:41.632 --> 14:44.635
And, Gordon, whatever this is, stop it.

14:50.140 --> 14:51.600
<i>Bruce, it's Silver.</i>

14:51.767 --> 14:53.269
<i>I just saw my uncle.</i>

14:53.435 --> 14:54.979
<i>He agreed to your deal.</i>

14:55.396 --> 14:57.523
<i>Everything you asked.</i>

14:57.940 --> 14:59.817
<i>He told me the name, Bruce.</i>

14:59.984 --> 15:01.652
<i>Meet me across the way after school.</i>

15:20.504 --> 15:21.672
Don't scream.

15:22.172 --> 15:23.465
Don't run.

15:23.632 --> 15:26.510
Just get in, or we kill the girl.

15:26.677 --> 15:28.053
No! Please!

15:36.812 --> 15:37.813
Go.

15:41.358 --> 15:42.526
<i>This scar tissue is old.</i>

15:43.402 --> 15:45.571
See how the wounds wrap over his shoulder?

15:45.779 --> 15:46.905
It was definitely self-inflicted.

15:47.072 --> 15:49.033
I stabbed him, he didn't flinch.

15:49.199 --> 15:50.951
And there are thick scars on the palms.

15:51.285 --> 15:52.786
He cut himself there repeatedly.

15:53.203 --> 15:54.830
Father Mike said
the leaders cut themselves,

15:54.997 --> 15:56.749
and then mark the followers
with the blood.

15:56.915 --> 15:58.125
Like a blessing.

15:58.292 --> 15:59.376
Charming.

15:59.710 --> 16:01.962
Dug up two more bodies
from the past three days.

16:02.129 --> 16:04.506
Career hoods.
Killed somewhere, then dumped.

16:04.673 --> 16:06.008
Both their throats cut.

16:06.258 --> 16:08.302
Seven down. Two to go.

16:08.761 --> 16:09.803
It's weird.

16:09.970 --> 16:11.764
How has nobody seen these monks till now?

16:12.598 --> 16:14.725
A, they're killing people
and carrying them across town,

16:14.892 --> 16:16.727
and B, they're monks.

16:18.937 --> 16:20.189
The woman who was attacked yesterday.

16:20.356 --> 16:23.817
She said the monk vanished
with the attacker,

16:23.984 --> 16:26.362
but that alley was a dead end.

16:32.409 --> 16:34.078
The sewers.

16:34.912 --> 16:36.205
Oh, no.

16:42.419 --> 16:49.009
So, the monk drags the woman's
attacker into the alley above us...

16:49.843 --> 16:51.970
Next thing,
he's food for seagulls.

16:55.182 --> 16:56.642
Ports are this way.

17:03.273 --> 17:04.316
Again?

17:05.984 --> 17:07.653
Did you try jiggling the handle?

17:09.947 --> 17:11.699
Well, what did you put down it?

17:14.368 --> 17:16.120
- Dr. Thompkins, can I help you?
- Hi, Ed.

17:16.286 --> 17:17.788
This is the autopsy on the dead monk.

17:17.955 --> 17:19.957
Jim wants you to run toxicology.

17:21.125 --> 17:22.292
Fascinating.

17:22.459 --> 17:24.461
The need to inflict
that kind of pain on oneself.

17:25.337 --> 17:26.380
Is there anything else?

17:27.464 --> 17:28.465
No.

17:29.258 --> 17:30.509
Yes.

17:30.926 --> 17:32.845
Was that Kristen you were just talking to?

17:33.011 --> 17:34.012
What?

17:34.221 --> 17:36.807
Sorry. It sounded like you were talking
to somebody in your apartment,

17:36.974 --> 17:38.809
- and who besides--
- I was talking to my plumber.

17:39.393 --> 17:40.561
Oh.

17:40.978 --> 17:42.354
Well, have you heard from Kristen?

17:42.521 --> 17:44.565
I know she said she was sick.
I was thinking of stopping by--

17:44.732 --> 17:46.608
As it happens, she is not sick.

17:47.234 --> 17:49.528
She lied. To all of us.

17:49.945 --> 17:53.323
I just found out. Miss Kringle left town
with Officer Dougherty.

17:53.657 --> 17:56.243
- She left Gotham with Dougherty?
- Mmm-hmm.

17:56.785 --> 17:57.995
But he was abusive.

17:58.537 --> 18:00.497
Love.

18:01.206 --> 18:04.251
Well, I'm stunned.

18:10.466 --> 18:11.508
Do you need to get that?

18:12.342 --> 18:13.469
No. I don't think so.

18:20.517 --> 18:23.520
Oh, Ed. You must be devastated.

18:24.021 --> 18:26.023
Right now,
I'm just trying to focus on the job.

18:26.732 --> 18:28.442
Well, let me know
if you ever want to talk.

18:28.817 --> 18:30.319
Thank you. That means a lot.

18:42.122 --> 18:44.708
- Yes.
<i>- Where is the spicy mustard?</i>

18:45.250 --> 18:46.835
You better not have finished it.

18:48.378 --> 18:49.546
Never mind.

18:57.387 --> 18:59.556
Silver, are you okay? What happened?

19:06.980 --> 19:09.983
You have one chance.
You let us go.

19:12.736 --> 19:15.572
You talk when I tell you to.

19:16.406 --> 19:18.075
Understand?

19:19.284 --> 19:22.871
Now, so you know,
we are outside of the city,

19:23.038 --> 19:26.124
and there is absolutely no one
to hear you scream.

19:26.291 --> 19:27.417
Except me.

19:27.626 --> 19:30.045
You work for the people
inside Wayne Enterprises.

19:30.212 --> 19:31.630
Whoever's paying you--

19:33.590 --> 19:38.679
Again, you talk when I tell you to.

19:39.972 --> 19:42.724
Now, my employers have heard

19:42.891 --> 19:46.436
<i>that you are thinking of selling
your company shares</i>

19:46.603 --> 19:49.022
to the uncle of this one.

19:50.190 --> 19:53.610
That's not good, but not why we're here.

19:54.278 --> 19:56.822
The issue is someone's been nosing

19:56.989 --> 20:02.494
into the deaths of Thomas
and poor Martha Wayne.

20:03.871 --> 20:06.832
And I wonder who. Mmm...

20:08.000 --> 20:12.629
Kidding, we know it was blondie's uncle.

20:13.088 --> 20:16.133
<i>So, I've been tasked to find out</i>

20:16.300 --> 20:20.304
what dear old uncle
told little Bruce Wayne.

20:20.470 --> 20:23.473
Nothing! Galavan didn't tell me anything!

20:25.142 --> 20:28.854
You think that I won't hurt you
because you're a kid

20:29.688 --> 20:31.315
or because you're you?

20:32.691 --> 20:35.736
How'd that work out
for your mommy and daddy?

20:37.779 --> 20:41.408
There're billions at stake here.

20:41.575 --> 20:43.285
And that's with a "B."

20:44.661 --> 20:47.497
Do what you want to me,
I don't know anything.

20:47.664 --> 20:49.583
Okay. So, we start with Goldilocks.

20:49.750 --> 20:50.834
You touch her, and I swear.

20:52.544 --> 20:53.879
Yeah?

20:54.046 --> 20:56.548
I've been threatened by the best, kid.

20:56.715 --> 21:00.385
And you, not exactly terrifying.

21:01.428 --> 21:05.933
Now let me tell you
how this is going to go.

21:06.850 --> 21:13.190
In a minute,
I'm gonna take one of you into the back

21:13.357 --> 21:17.277
and start cutting off your fingers.

21:17.444 --> 21:18.862
<i>And you're gonna talk.</i>

21:19.488 --> 21:24.368
I've been doing this a very,
very long time, and everyone talks.

21:26.453 --> 21:30.624
So unless
you're really into wearing mittens,

21:31.041 --> 21:33.043
<i>this is your last chance.</i>

21:33.210 --> 21:36.505
What does Theo Galavan know?

21:42.719 --> 21:44.554
Okeydokey.

21:48.225 --> 21:50.435
- Let's go.
- No, no, no!

21:50.602 --> 21:52.562
- No, no! Stop! Stop, stop!
- No!

21:52.729 --> 21:53.772
Silver, you have to tell him.

21:53.939 --> 21:55.273
<i>I'll hold my side of the deal. I promise.</i>

21:55.440 --> 21:57.109
Please, please. I promise!

21:58.860 --> 22:01.071
But my uncle didn't tell me anything.

22:01.405 --> 22:02.572
But you left me a message.

22:03.156 --> 22:05.242
I was supposed to keep you busy
till this evening.

22:05.659 --> 22:07.494
<i>He's sure he's going to be freed,</i>

22:07.661 --> 22:10.038
then he'll convince you
to sell your company.

22:10.622 --> 22:13.834
I'm sorry, Bruce. I don't know anything.

22:14.167 --> 22:16.378
- Really?
- I don't!

22:16.545 --> 22:19.256
- That's a pity.
- No! No! No!

22:19.423 --> 22:20.507
- Kid--
- No! Please!

22:20.674 --> 22:23.385
Kid, you really need better
taste in women.

22:24.428 --> 22:26.013
No!

22:26.179 --> 22:29.057
No! No! No!

22:29.224 --> 22:30.600
Stop! Bruce!

22:37.983 --> 22:40.944
Just when you think
Gotham's shown her last jewel,

22:41.111 --> 22:42.946
she reveals herself like a flower.

22:43.405 --> 22:44.656
You're mixing metaphors.

22:44.823 --> 22:46.450
I'm in a freaking sewer.

22:48.702 --> 22:50.037
You hear something?

22:51.788 --> 22:54.458
A voice?

23:12.809 --> 23:15.437
I know this bum. Muscle for hire.

23:15.812 --> 23:17.564
<i>Check out the finger paint
on the forehead.</i>

23:17.731 --> 23:20.067
Victim at the port had the same thing.

23:20.233 --> 23:21.485
Like a blessing.

23:22.235 --> 23:24.905
Whoever did this can't be too far away.
We should--

23:25.072 --> 23:26.156
Harvey!

23:34.539 --> 23:38.001
No, no, no. Please, please don't. Hold.

23:46.343 --> 23:48.637
- He needs an ambulance.
- Boo-hoo!

23:49.638 --> 23:51.264
We gotta wake him up. Make him talk.

23:51.431 --> 23:54.142
A religious fanatic who doesn't feel pain?
What's our angle?

23:54.309 --> 23:56.103
These nut-jobs have killed eight people.

23:56.269 --> 23:58.480
Whatever their plan is,
whatever Galavan's up to,

23:58.647 --> 24:01.108
it is happening now! We make him talk!

24:01.274 --> 24:02.692
What are we gonna do, torture him?

24:02.859 --> 24:04.277
Threaten to let him die? He wouldn't care.

24:06.988 --> 24:09.533
There's no signal down here.
I'll call it in, but I gotta go up.

24:09.908 --> 24:11.284
Thank you.

24:13.370 --> 24:17.249
The day of reckoning...

24:19.459 --> 24:23.588
The day of reckoning, Brother...

24:31.680 --> 24:33.056
Bruce?

24:36.059 --> 24:37.561
<i>Whoo!</i>

24:39.729 --> 24:42.566
Well, if nothing else,

24:42.732 --> 24:47.112
today has given me
a newfound respect for boy billionaires.

24:47.279 --> 24:50.240
Kid's tougher than he looks.
Didn't know a damn thing.

24:50.407 --> 24:52.075
Did you kill him?

24:52.242 --> 24:54.744
No. Not yet.

24:54.911 --> 24:56.872
But the rest is kinda up to you.

24:57.998 --> 25:01.418
I told you.
My uncle didn't tell me anything.

25:01.877 --> 25:03.170
Are you gonna stick with that story?

25:03.336 --> 25:04.713
It's the truth.

25:05.589 --> 25:07.591
Bruce, I'm sorry! I don't know anything!

25:07.757 --> 25:11.553
You know what? I don't like you.

25:12.721 --> 25:16.057
The Wayne kid, he's got some sap in him.

25:16.933 --> 25:18.268
But you...

25:18.435 --> 25:22.230
You know when you meet someone
and you just don't click?

25:23.940 --> 25:25.734
That's the way I feel about you.

25:26.610 --> 25:29.196
That's why this is gonna be
so much easier.

25:32.115 --> 25:33.658
What're you doing?

25:33.825 --> 25:38.121
I'm gonna make sure
that you are telling the truth.

25:40.457 --> 25:43.126
Touch me,
and my uncle will have you gutted.

25:43.543 --> 25:45.921
Every person you love will die screaming.

25:47.172 --> 25:51.259
I've had enough of this. Let me go. Now!

25:51.676 --> 25:52.844
Well, hello!

25:53.929 --> 25:55.847
Nice to meet you.

25:56.014 --> 25:58.308
I knew there was someone hiding in there.

25:58.642 --> 26:01.311
Are you deaf as well as ugly?

26:01.478 --> 26:03.605
I said, let me go!

26:04.481 --> 26:06.691
I heard you, princess.

26:08.360 --> 26:09.778
What are you doing?

26:10.528 --> 26:13.990
Stop! Malone! It's Malone!

26:14.157 --> 26:17.160
- What's that?
- Malone. That's the name.

26:17.410 --> 26:19.996
The man who killed Bruce Wayne's parents.

26:20.830 --> 26:21.915
So your uncle did tell you.

26:22.082 --> 26:24.834
Not today. Before.
When he first found out.

26:25.001 --> 26:26.169
Malone's a very common name.

26:26.336 --> 26:29.172
His first name begins with "M."
That's all I know.

26:30.006 --> 26:32.217
- Mmm...
- Stop.

26:33.009 --> 26:36.346
You know what? I believe you.

26:38.473 --> 26:40.016
Are we good?

26:43.520 --> 26:44.521
Yes.

26:47.023 --> 26:48.108
We're good.

26:49.150 --> 26:51.528
Hey. Remember me?

26:51.695 --> 26:53.863
The gutter trash?

26:54.823 --> 26:57.575
Bruce. What's happening?

26:57.742 --> 26:59.369
What does it look like, dummy?

26:59.536 --> 27:01.121
We tricked you.

27:01.705 --> 27:04.874
Though if it was up to me,
you would've lost a few fingers.

27:06.042 --> 27:07.377
Going soft, Tom?

27:07.585 --> 27:09.212
Cat.

27:12.299 --> 27:13.300
Thank you.

27:13.466 --> 27:16.594
Thank you, Mr. Wayne.
Pleasure doing business.

27:16.761 --> 27:18.555
Sorry about the slaps.

27:18.805 --> 27:20.724
Now, are you two gonna be okay
with this one?

27:20.890 --> 27:23.143
Or would you like me to, uh...

27:23.351 --> 27:25.353
Nah. We're cool.

27:26.146 --> 27:28.648
Mr. Wayne. Boys!

27:31.651 --> 27:34.070
You're probably very confused right now.

27:34.738 --> 27:36.698
Probably have a million questions
going through your head.

27:36.865 --> 27:38.116
- Bruce, please--
- Be quiet.

27:39.367 --> 27:40.744
I trusted you, Silver.

27:41.328 --> 27:44.748
Even after your uncle was arrested,
I still believed you were my friend.

27:45.707 --> 27:47.917
It was finally Selina
who convinced me otherwise.

27:48.084 --> 27:49.753
I never bought your stupid act.

27:50.253 --> 27:51.629
She broke into your apartment.

27:53.048 --> 27:54.424
Found the file you had on me.

27:55.091 --> 27:57.260
It was clear that you'd been sent
to push me to sell my company.

27:57.761 --> 27:59.429
That your entire family was corrupt.

27:59.596 --> 28:00.972
<i>But I still had to find out
what your uncle knew</i>

28:01.139 --> 28:02.140
<i>about my parents' murder.</i>

28:02.432 --> 28:03.600
Now I do.

28:05.477 --> 28:06.936
Thank you.

28:07.103 --> 28:08.646
Bruce, wait!

28:08.897 --> 28:10.482
<i>That name wasn't real.</i>

28:11.441 --> 28:13.777
It was just something I made up
to stop him.

28:14.903 --> 28:15.945
<i>That's funny.</i>

28:16.112 --> 28:19.949
You only made it up
when you were under the knife,

28:20.367 --> 28:22.243
not when Bruce was getting tortured.

28:22.452 --> 28:24.037
You little bitch. I'll--

28:24.204 --> 28:27.582
Please. Try it.

28:32.128 --> 28:33.630
You're right about my uncle.

28:34.130 --> 28:36.049
He's everything everyone says.

28:37.801 --> 28:39.094
Worse.

28:39.636 --> 28:43.014
When he finds out what I told you,
he'll kill me.

28:44.641 --> 28:46.643
You pretended to be my friend.

28:50.105 --> 28:51.147
Goodbye, Silver.

28:52.399 --> 28:55.693
Bruce, the things you told me today.

28:57.987 --> 28:59.322
I believed you.

29:00.448 --> 29:02.826
Yes. That was the point.

29:02.992 --> 29:04.828
Bruce, you can't do this.

29:06.955 --> 29:08.248
It isn't you.

29:17.424 --> 29:18.842
That's what you think.

29:23.179 --> 29:24.347
But you're wrong.

29:27.851 --> 29:29.352
Bruce.

29:30.270 --> 29:32.647
Bruce! Bruce!

29:48.538 --> 29:49.873
Ambulance--

29:54.294 --> 29:56.296
Drink, Brother.

29:59.340 --> 30:01.217
- Can't see...
- You're hurt.

30:01.384 --> 30:03.344
- Lie still.
- The police...

30:03.511 --> 30:05.597
Dead. We got here just in time.

30:07.390 --> 30:09.601
The blood of the nine...

30:09.767 --> 30:12.061
Shall wash away the sin.

30:12.729 --> 30:15.648
I fulfilled my task, Brother.

30:15.815 --> 30:18.401
All that remains is the son.

30:18.568 --> 30:20.737
Yes. The son.

30:21.488 --> 30:24.073
Give me your blessing, Brother.

30:28.536 --> 30:30.079
Please.

30:46.095 --> 30:49.599
The Son of Gotham shall die,

30:50.475 --> 30:53.853
and the city shall be cleansed.

30:55.188 --> 30:56.773
<i>Detective, where's the--</i>

30:58.191 --> 30:59.442
What?

31:02.111 --> 31:05.615
- Who are you?
- G.C.P.D. You're under arrest.

31:05.949 --> 31:08.326
<i>Take him to the hospital.
See if you can get anything from him.</i>

31:08.743 --> 31:10.078
I've gotta see Barnes.

31:20.213 --> 31:21.464
<i>Bruce?</i>

31:22.298 --> 31:23.633
<i>Bruce, you in here?</i>

31:24.467 --> 31:25.843
Master Bruce.

31:27.637 --> 31:29.055
Master B, are you here?

31:33.393 --> 31:35.144
You're trespassing.

31:36.938 --> 31:38.815
I'm looking for Bruce Wayne.

31:38.982 --> 31:40.525
He's not answering his phone.

31:40.692 --> 31:42.235
He's not home, he's not at school.

31:42.652 --> 31:45.446
My guess, he's with
that snotty little niece of yours.

31:45.989 --> 31:47.115
Sorry.

31:47.657 --> 31:50.827
Now, I suggest you leave.
While you still can.

31:51.911 --> 31:53.830
I see, you're a bit of a player, are you?

31:54.872 --> 31:56.332
<i>How does it work then, Tabby?</i>

31:56.499 --> 31:58.167
Big, bad Galavan barks the orders,

31:58.334 --> 32:00.169
and you scamper around
bringing home dead rabbits,

32:00.336 --> 32:02.005
so you might get a little pat on the head?

32:02.171 --> 32:05.008
I wonder what he'd do
if I just disappeared you.

32:05.675 --> 32:07.260
Honestly, I don't think he'd care.

32:07.427 --> 32:11.014
If I learn anything's happened
to that little boy,

32:11.806 --> 32:13.391
we'll find out, won't we?

32:32.869 --> 32:33.911
Hurts, don't it?

32:53.389 --> 32:56.392
For the record, I was telling the truth.

32:56.559 --> 32:58.394
I have no idea where Bruce Wayne is.

32:59.020 --> 33:00.563
But I'll tell him you were asking.

33:40.812 --> 33:42.939
Mr. Dent, your witness.

33:43.106 --> 33:45.233
So, Mayor James--

33:45.400 --> 33:48.569
Excuse me, Mr. Dent,
I think you mean former mayor.

33:49.195 --> 33:52.615
I'm just a citizen of Gotham
here to tell the truth.

33:56.202 --> 33:57.286
Mr. James.

33:58.996 --> 34:00.665
If you could begin by telling us

34:00.832 --> 34:03.042
where you spent
the month of October this year.

34:03.209 --> 34:04.836
<i>- I'd be happy to.</i>
- Where the hell have you been?

34:05.002 --> 34:06.629
Bullock and I captured one of the monks.

34:06.796 --> 34:08.923
I was right,
they're completing some sort of ritual

34:09.090 --> 34:10.717
to cleanse the city of sin.

34:10.883 --> 34:12.176
<i>They have one victim left.</i>

34:12.343 --> 34:14.971
They're calling him the Son of Gotham.

34:15.221 --> 34:17.140
Did they say anything about Galavan?

34:17.640 --> 34:18.808
<i>I was not kidnapped
by Theo Galavan.</i>

34:18.975 --> 34:20.268
They didn't, did they?

34:23.062 --> 34:24.439
Quiet.

34:25.773 --> 34:27.942
Mr. James, please repeat what you said.

34:30.069 --> 34:32.697
Theo Galavan did not kidnap me.

34:33.531 --> 34:34.741
Your Honor, the witness has suffered--

34:34.907 --> 34:36.909
Please explain yourself, sir.

34:37.618 --> 34:40.163
<i>Why did you lie? Who held you captive?</i>

34:41.539 --> 34:43.332
Oswald Cobblepot. The Penguin.

34:43.624 --> 34:44.834
<i>He hates Theo Galavan.</i>

34:45.668 --> 34:47.754
<i>He tried to kill him multiple times.</i>

34:49.338 --> 34:50.465
He told me what to say.

34:52.008 --> 34:54.260
- He threatened me with terrible things.
- He's lying!

34:54.427 --> 34:55.636
Gordon! Gordon!

34:55.803 --> 34:57.472
- Detective Gordon, silence!
- Gordon!

34:57.638 --> 35:00.641
Your Honor,
I move my client be released at once.

35:00.808 --> 35:02.560
Your Honor,
the state requests a recess to further--

35:02.727 --> 35:03.853
Quiet.

35:04.020 --> 35:07.356
Mr. James, you do realize
you are under oath?

35:09.609 --> 35:13.863
Oswald Cobblepot tortured me,
put my head in a box.

35:15.573 --> 35:17.074
He made me lie.

35:18.701 --> 35:21.037
I'm so very, very sorry.

35:21.204 --> 35:23.247
In light of Mr. James' testimony

35:23.414 --> 35:26.375
and the complete absence
of any other evidence

35:26.542 --> 35:28.211
<i>provided by the state,</i>

35:28.377 --> 35:30.338
I hereby order Theo Galavan released

35:30.505 --> 35:32.548
<i>and the case against him dismissed.</i>

35:32.715 --> 35:33.716
- Your Honor!
- Come on, Jim!

35:33.883 --> 35:34.967
There's nothing we can do.

35:36.677 --> 35:38.888
Your Honor, may I say a few words?

35:39.764 --> 35:41.015
I think that's only fair.

35:42.642 --> 35:44.143
I'd just like to state that

35:44.977 --> 35:50.149
I harbor no ill will
toward Detective Gordon and G.C.P.D.

35:50.399 --> 35:51.818
They did their jobs.

35:52.443 --> 35:54.237
They're still my heroes.

35:55.655 --> 35:57.073
<i>What do you say, Detective Gordon?</i>

35:57.448 --> 35:59.575
Can we move forward together

35:59.742 --> 36:04.247
to fix this broken, beautiful city?

36:06.123 --> 36:07.583
<i>- Hey! Hey! Hey!</i>
- No, Jim!

36:07.750 --> 36:08.751
- You son of a bitch!
<i>- Officers! Arrest him!</i>

36:08.918 --> 36:11.420
You're a son of a bitch!
I'm gonna get you!

36:11.587 --> 36:13.381
- Open the door!
- I'm gonna get you!

36:13.548 --> 36:15.216
<i>Get him out of here!</i>

36:15.591 --> 36:17.552
Ah, come on! Get your hands off of me!

36:17.718 --> 36:20.221
Relax. We're not arresting you.

36:32.108 --> 36:33.401
Alfred?

36:38.072 --> 36:39.574
He's probably out looking for me.

36:41.117 --> 36:42.326
Thank you, Selina.

36:42.869 --> 36:43.870
I couldn't have done this without you.

36:44.495 --> 36:46.831
I was just glad to see
the two-faced bitch get served.

36:48.708 --> 36:50.209
What're you gonna do now?

36:51.043 --> 36:55.381
You gonna tell the cops
or look for this Malone guy yourself?

36:55.548 --> 36:58.301
Honestly,
I haven't thought that far ahead.

37:00.845 --> 37:03.681
So, when you whispered to her,

37:04.932 --> 37:07.143
before she went to her uncle,

37:07.560 --> 37:08.978
what did you say?

37:09.812 --> 37:10.980
You want to know what I said?

37:11.689 --> 37:13.524
Hey, if you don't wanna tell me,
then I can leave--

37:13.691 --> 37:16.319
I told her I've never met anyone like her.

37:18.237 --> 37:20.448
I told her I trusted her with my life.

37:21.908 --> 37:26.871
And that I felt tied to her
in a way that I couldn't explain,

37:27.038 --> 37:28.331
but wouldn't change.

37:30.499 --> 37:31.751
Ever.

37:33.920 --> 37:35.963
The best liars always tell the truth.

37:36.964 --> 37:38.507
And that was true?

37:39.884 --> 37:41.177
Yes.

37:42.929 --> 37:44.347
Just not about her.

37:49.101 --> 37:50.269
Um...

37:50.853 --> 37:51.938
Um...

37:52.396 --> 37:57.443
I'm gonna steal one of your cars
to take to the city. Cool?

37:59.028 --> 38:00.196
Sure.

38:08.412 --> 38:10.539
It's good you're changing.

38:11.374 --> 38:15.044
Just don't change too much.

38:25.012 --> 38:26.889
Why did you keep her glasses
to begin with?

38:27.056 --> 38:28.307
I told--

38:29.183 --> 38:30.559
I loved Miss Kringle.

38:31.018 --> 38:32.561
<i>Just get rid of them.</i>

38:32.895 --> 38:34.689
Dr. Thompkins is suspicious.

38:36.190 --> 38:37.358
Amateurs.

38:54.500 --> 38:58.087
Gabe, when I gave you this address,
I was not inviting pop-ins.

38:58.254 --> 39:00.006
Galavan's been let go.

39:05.594 --> 39:06.929
Where is he?

39:13.602 --> 39:15.062
My-my.

39:15.146 --> 39:17.231
What a difference a day brings.

39:17.982 --> 39:21.027
<i>Here you're the prisoner, and I'm free.</i>

39:21.569 --> 39:23.112
Fortune's wheel.

39:23.279 --> 39:25.072
<i>Turn, turn.</i>

39:26.282 --> 39:27.575
These cops?

39:27.742 --> 39:30.453
Good men who can tell
which way the wind's blowing.

39:31.787 --> 39:34.457
Now, we have a very small window.

39:34.623 --> 39:37.209
I have places to be, you have to die,

39:37.376 --> 39:39.879
but I know you must have questions. So--

39:40.046 --> 39:44.383
The monks. They work for you?

39:44.967 --> 39:49.889
For centuries, the Order of St. Dumas
has protected my family.

39:51.140 --> 39:54.769
They have been a light in a dark world.

39:57.438 --> 39:59.148
Shall I tell you a secret?

40:00.149 --> 40:04.236
Theo Galavan is a mask.

40:05.488 --> 40:09.742
My name is Dumas, and my family
built this city out of nothing.

40:10.326 --> 40:14.497
But we were betrayed. Driven out. Erased.

40:15.122 --> 40:16.916
So, that's all this is about?

40:17.625 --> 40:18.876
Revenge?

40:19.043 --> 40:23.005
No. This is about atonement.

40:23.506 --> 40:27.051
The ground that Gotham is built on
is poisoned

40:27.218 --> 40:29.178
by the wrongs done to my forefathers.

40:29.512 --> 40:30.805
I will change that.

40:30.971 --> 40:34.016
By killing nine random people?
You're insane.

40:36.018 --> 40:38.187
I can see why you'd think so.

40:38.687 --> 40:40.439
<i>Ritual blood sacrifices,</i>

40:40.606 --> 40:43.818
a bunch of guys in robes
chanting prophesies.

40:43.984 --> 40:45.069
It's a bit too...

40:45.986 --> 40:49.031
But belief itself.

40:49.198 --> 40:50.699
That's what matters, Detective.

40:50.866 --> 40:54.537
Belief gives strength, purpose.

40:55.371 --> 40:57.289
And not all the victims are random.

40:59.250 --> 41:01.043
Son of Gotham.

41:02.253 --> 41:03.879
Goodbye, James.

41:04.880 --> 41:06.924
I couldn't have done it without you.

41:09.552 --> 41:10.719
Ah, what the hell!

41:11.637 --> 41:14.140
I have a few minutes. Cut him loose.

41:18.519 --> 41:20.396
<i>Go on, Jim. Give it your best shot.</i>

41:20.771 --> 41:22.148
Save Gotham.

41:58.559 --> 42:00.102
Kill him.

42:01.854 --> 42:03.272
Don't make it quick.

42:15.701 --> 42:18.495
Alfred? Is that you?
You won't believe what I learned--

42:21.624 --> 42:24.126
Sorry. Not Alfred.

42:39.600 --> 42:40.684
Hello, Jim.

42:42.811 --> 42:46.190
Lucky for you,
Gabe had people following Galavan.

42:46.982 --> 42:49.401
Now, where is he?

42:51.028 --> 42:52.655
Where's Galavan?

42:53.447 --> 42:57.117
Tell me! Where is Galavan?

43:04.667 --> 43:08.087
You've shown mettle and ingenuity, my boy.

43:09.421 --> 43:10.756
But that's all done with.

43:11.465 --> 43:12.758
What do you want?

43:15.636 --> 43:18.931
Why, your life, of course.

44:06.061 --> 44:07.062
