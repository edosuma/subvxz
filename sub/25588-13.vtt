09:59.890 --> 10:01.976
This started with you
and your poor education.

10:02.059 --> 10:04.020
That's why I came back
to get you into Eliteanati.

10:04.103 --> 10:05.104
And how's that going?

10:05.187 --> 10:08.482
Don't worry, I have a plan.
But there's a four percent chance that...

10:08.566 --> 10:10.443
Maybe you should take a break
from yourself

10:10.526 --> 10:13.571
because you're both Melvin,
and that's a lot of Melvin.

10:13.654 --> 10:16.782
- Yeah, let Harold and me fix this.
- You two broken crayons? Ha!

10:16.866 --> 10:18.576
- I'd like to see that.
- So would I.

10:18.659 --> 10:21.537
- They certainly can't do any worse.
- How can you say that to yourself?

10:21.621 --> 10:23.789
Quick question.
Do the nanobots have a leader?

10:23.873 --> 10:27.293
Of course. Every nanotribe
has a nanochief or a Nanozero.

10:27.376 --> 10:28.586
Perfect. Let's comic.

10:28.669 --> 10:33.132
[narrator] <i>Chapter 3: Captain Underpants
and the Nightmarish Nanozero.</i>

10:33.424 --> 10:34.634
<i>By George and Harold.</i>

10:34.717 --> 10:38.346
<i>So there was a bad nanobot
named Nanozero, who's tiny.</i>

10:38.429 --> 10:40.139
<i>Like dollhouse-furniture tiny.</i>

10:40.222 --> 10:42.933
<i>And he was the boss
of a nanobot gang destroying stuff</i>

10:43.017 --> 10:45.561
<i>like taco trucks... spicy,
and gluten stores... allergy,</i>

10:45.645 --> 10:47.271
<i>and horse spas... horse noise!</i>

10:47.355 --> 10:49.231
<i>And everyone was all,
"Did a ghost break that?"</i>

10:49.315 --> 10:52.526
<i>'cause they couldn't see the nanobots,
and ghosts are a menace.</i>

10:52.610 --> 10:56.155
<i>But then, Nanozero's gang snuck
into the President of the Earth's brain</i>

10:56.238 --> 10:58.616
<i>and took it over
and made him all, "Big is bad!"</i>

10:58.699 --> 11:02.078
<i>and, "Who needs doctors?"
and, "I'm canceling the space program!"</i>

11:02.161 --> 11:04.961
<i>So the Vice President of Earth
activated the Captain Underpants signal,</i>

11:05.039 --> 11:06.999
<i>which is just a kite
made of big underwears.</i>

11:07.083 --> 11:08.668
<i>And Captain Underpants was all like,</i>

11:08.751 --> 11:10.753
<i>"This better be good
'cause I was sledding."</i>

11:10.836 --> 11:11.879
<i>And the VP was like,</i>

11:11.962 --> 11:15.299
<i>"You gotta go into the President
of Earth's brain to save Earth!"</i>

11:15.383 --> 11:19.011
<i>And Captain Underpants was all like,
"Sure, 'cause Earth is where I sled,</i>

11:19.095 --> 11:20.175
<i>which is what I was doing."</i>

11:20.221 --> 11:21.722
<i>So the Earth's top scientists</i>

11:21.806 --> 11:23.974
<i>put Captain Underpants
in a huge clothes dryer</i>

11:24.058 --> 11:26.102
<i>on high heat and shrinked him</i>

11:26.185 --> 11:29.146
<i>till he was small as dolls' hands
times garjillion!</i>

11:29.230 --> 11:30.106
<i>♪ Tra-la-la ♪</i>

11:30.189 --> 11:32.691
[narrator] <i>He flew

11:32.775 --> 11:34.902
<i>'cause noses? Nose, thank you.</i>

11:34.985 --> 11:37.947
<i>And Captain Underpants found Nanozero
at the brain steering wheel</i>

11:38.030 --> 11:41.242
<i>and briefs-bashed the mecha-mite,
clank-pink-clank.</i>

11:41.325 --> 11:43.494
<i>But Nanozero used nanojudo...</i>

11:44.578 --> 11:46.539
<i>to flip Captain Underpants to the ground,</i>

11:46.622 --> 11:49.917
<i>and the other nanoguys
crowded in to nanotize him.</i>

11:50.000 --> 11:52.670
<i>That's when Captain Underpants
couldn't stop humming a tune</i>

11:52.753 --> 11:56.090
<i>that had been stuck in his head all day
and made Nanozero explode,</i>

11:56.173 --> 12:00.428
<i>which shut his nanogang down
like a video rental store. Overdue.</i>

12:00.511 --> 12:03.222
<i>Then Captain Underpants stretched
back to normal. Stretch!</i>

12:03.305 --> 12:06.767
<i>And the President of Earth was so happy,
he made sledding day a holiday.</i>

12:06.851 --> 12:09.145
<i>But not for schools. Okay, the end.</i>

12:09.228 --> 12:12.773
So, can we shrink down
and go inside Captain Underpants' brain?

12:12.857 --> 12:15.359
And we can shut down the nanobots
with an annoying song.

12:15.443 --> 12:16.610

12:18.195 --> 12:21.240

Nothing personal. [grunts]

- Silence, you leaky faucets.

12:40.634 --> 12:43.220

12:43.304 --> 12:44.930

12:52.313 --> 12:53.689
- Hop on!
- [both] Whoa!

12:53.772 --> 12:55.941
What? You can turn yourself
into a hovercraft?

12:56.025 --> 12:57.345
Why haven't you done that before?

12:57.401 --> 12:59.987
Because this is the season finale.
Now climb aboard.

13:00.279 --> 13:03.908
- You mean, climb a-borg?
- [chuckles] So good.

13:06.285 --> 13:09.538
Seriously, who rents igloos?

13:12.583 --> 13:15.503
Hey, igloos! I should rent one.

13:18.589 --> 13:20.049
This hovercraft is awesome.

13:20.132 --> 13:23.135

sticking out of the middle.

Hey, that's me.

13:24.220 --> 13:27.723
You have returned to be vanquished.
Very thoughtful.

- [Harold] Cut us down to size, Melvin!
- I will. Soon.

13:31.393 --> 13:33.229
- Why are you waiting?
- Dramatic tension.

13:33.479 --> 13:34.480
What, are you nuts?

13:34.563 --> 13:37.274
No. I'm actually waiting
for the software to finish rebooting.

13:37.483 --> 13:38.567
The bigger they are...

13:38.651 --> 13:41.028
- Come on, Melvin, we're out of time!
- Done.

13:42.947 --> 13:45.824
Hmm, our punch must have atomized them.

13:45.950 --> 13:48.786

13:54.124 --> 13:56.544
[Harold] Look at this stuff
in Captain Underpants' ear.

13:56.752 --> 14:00.798
There's a wallet, car keys,
loose change, a rubber duck,

14:00.881 --> 14:04.802
an origami crane, a souvenir keychain
from the Cleveland airport?

14:04.885 --> 14:07.805
He doesn't have pockets,
so I guess he keeps stuff in here.

14:07.888 --> 14:09.640
- You say that like it makes sense.
- Okay.

14:09.723 --> 14:13.143
Now all we gotta do is find a really
annoying song to confuse Nanozero.

14:13.310 --> 14:15.729
Then we just gotta find Nanozero
and play it, right?

14:15.813 --> 14:19.400
Wrong. Brain cells corrupted by nanobots
will be guarding Nanozero.

14:19.483 --> 14:21.803
We'll need help from the cells
that haven't been corrupted.
