-What?

00:04.780 --> 00:05.906
-JOSEPH: Hey, hey!
-Come on!

00:05.960 --> 00:07.177
Hey, get off of him, man!

00:07.220 --> 00:09.654
This guy just started
yelling at my boy.

00:09.700 --> 00:10.689
Racial stuff.

00:10.740 --> 00:11.786
I got you something.

00:15.710 --> 00:16.961
BILL: A quinceaera.

00:17.010 --> 00:18.705
Yes, your daughter
will become a woman.

00:18.750 --> 00:20.092
Please don't say that.

00:20.150 --> 00:21.094
We don't wanna live
wrth grandma.

00:21.150 --> 00:22.048
We wanna live with you.

00:22.100 --> 00:23.624
I wanna keep my kids.

00:23.670 --> 00:25.490
With the money that the state
is going to give me--

00:25.540 --> 00:27.064
These kids aren't a paycheck!

00:27.630 --> 00:30.281
I'm opening an investigation
into your office's handling

00:30.330 --> 00:31.490
of the Johnson case.

00:31.550 --> 00:33.802
Or you reconsider
your announcement.

00:33.850 --> 00:35.898
I'm the sheriff
of Los Angeles County,

00:35.940 --> 00:37.726
and I aim to keep this job.

00:37.770 --> 00:39.374
I have information
that can hurt Bill.

00:39.430 --> 00:41.113
I want you to concede the race.

00:41.690 --> 00:42.941
Explain it to me again.

00:42.990 --> 00:44.548
BISHOP:
Two dead in two days.

00:44.600 --> 00:46.249
CADE: They're all informants
for the department.

00:46.300 --> 00:47.904
Someone is killing our CIs.

01:20.420 --> 01:22.638
Hey. You don't need
to go down there.

01:22.690 --> 01:24.032
It's nothing I haven't seen.

01:24.080 --> 01:25.422
I know. But you don't
need to see this one.

01:27.390 --> 01:28.550
[flies buzzing]

01:34.610 --> 01:35.998
So it is Levon.

01:36.400 --> 01:37.435
Yeah.

01:38.140 --> 01:39.300
Was it a struggle?

01:40.620 --> 01:41.655
It was an execution.

01:42.360 --> 01:44.009
So his own people did this.

01:44.060 --> 01:45.311
That's how it looks, yeah.

01:45.360 --> 01:47.146
I just met with him last night.

01:48.100 --> 01:49.965
He was leaving town.
Gettin' out the game.

01:52.190 --> 01:53.191
I should have known.

01:54.410 --> 01:55.547
Those are the consequences
in his world.

01:55.590 --> 01:56.716
That is not on you.

01:58.160 --> 01:59.639
Besides, we have
a bigger issue here.

02:00.810 --> 02:02.152
How did they find out?

02:24.100 --> 02:25.351
Man, what happened?

02:25.400 --> 02:27.095
You got banged
upside the head, brother.

02:27.140 --> 02:29.927
-Luclq it wasn't worse.
-Jacob, where's Curtis?

02:30.540 --> 02:32.883
-They took him.
-Who took him?

02:33.500 --> 02:34.797
I don't know.

Hey, handsome.
Where have you been?

03:00.260 --> 03:02.649
[sighs] Just dealing
with a situation.

03:02.700 --> 03:05.009
So have I.
Your daughter's
quinceaerais tomorrow.

03:05.050 --> 03:06.267
Oh, I know.

03:06.310 --> 03:08.653
It's only been 15 years
in the making.

03:09.400 --> 03:10.446
What's wrong?

03:11.840 --> 03:13.273
Nothing.

03:13.320 --> 03:14.355
Bill.

03:15.840 --> 03:17.398
Someone's killing informants.

03:18.320 --> 03:20.106
They got Curtis.
He's in the wind.

03:20.150 --> 03:21.401
PAULA: The Mayor?

03:21.460 --> 03:22.882
Oh, God.

03:24.420 --> 03:25.899
If informants
are being killed...

03:26.330 --> 03:28.582
There could be a leak.
I just don't know yet.

03:29.770 --> 03:31.635
What are you gonna do?

03:31.680 --> 03:34.160
-Whatever I have to.
-PAULA: Okay.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.553
Just remember your daughter.

03:37.300 --> 03:38.688
There's not a thing
in this world

03:38.740 --> 03:40.298
that'll stop me
from being there.

03:41.430 --> 03:42.772
I love you, honey.

03:43.570 --> 03:44.605
I love you, too.

03:53.140 --> 03:54.448
Tell me something.

03:54.490 --> 03:56.219
There's no smoking gun,
if that's what you mean.

03:56.270 --> 03:57.350
Well, how many is it now?

03:57.410 --> 03:58.616
Three confirmed dead.
One missmg.

03:58.670 --> 03:59.830
-And they were all ours?
-CADE: Yeah.

03:59.890 --> 04:01.232
I mean, informants
get passed around.

04:01.280 --> 04:02.531
BILL:
Well, I know that, Cade.

04:02.590 --> 04:04.535
What I'm asking you
is what's the thread?

04:04.590 --> 04:05.716
How were they connected?

04:05.760 --> 04:07.489
Who groomed 'em?
Who shared 'em?

04:07.550 --> 04:09.893
-We're workin' it, boss.
-Two of them were registered.

04:09.940 --> 04:10.975
Levon was not.

04:11.860 --> 04:13.020
That was Luna's.

04:15.210 --> 04:17.553
[sighs] So all those informants
had their own crews

04:17.600 --> 04:19.465
-they ran with, right?
-Yeah.

04:19.520 --> 04:21.169
That means
they have people in County.

04:21.210 --> 04:22.905
They still gotta get the names
from somewhere.

04:22.950 --> 04:24.906
I hate to say this but maybe
it's one of our own.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.473
You know,
a deputy working a jail...

04:27.740 --> 04:29.389
It's the clearest answer
we've got right now, boss.

04:29.440 --> 04:31.829
No, we're missing something.

04:31.880 --> 04:32.915
Get me answers.

04:39.930 --> 04:41.352
Please.
Make yourself at home.

04:41.410 --> 04:43.014
Nice seeing you too, Jerry.

04:43.060 --> 04:44.368
Is this the kinda treatment

04:44.410 --> 04:45.843
I can expect from
the Riley administration?

04:45.890 --> 04:47.369
Well, that's completely
up to you.

04:47.410 --> 04:49.549
Are you willing to do
what's necessary?

04:49.590 --> 04:52.104
I've been giving this
a great deal of consideration.

04:52.850 --> 04:54.715
And I don't think it's time
to share my information

04:54.770 --> 04:56.283
on Hollister with you.

04:58.340 --> 05:00.729
Fine. I have Johnson.

05:00.770 --> 05:03.079
-That is more than enough.
-No, it's not.

05:03.120 --> 05:04.337
And how do you know?

05:04.390 --> 05:06.381
I've seen more cases
successfully prosecuted

05:06.430 --> 05:08.341
than you might have
in your entire career.

05:08.390 --> 05:09.698
This one's a loser.

05:09.740 --> 05:11.389
You keep
telling yourself that, Jerry.

05:12.260 --> 05:13.306
Good day.

05:16.050 --> 05:17.301
CARTER: It stinks in here.

05:17.830 --> 05:19.092
I can hardly breathe.

05:20.230 --> 05:22.926
-They should bleach this--
-Shut up, Carter!

05:24.800 --> 05:25.926
What's your problem?

05:28.500 --> 05:29.489
Why did you do it?

05:29.540 --> 05:31.053
Come on, that guy had it coming.

05:31.110 --> 05:32.498
No, not that.

05:32.540 --> 05:33.620
The lie.

05:33.680 --> 05:35.159
'Cause I knew you would back me.

05:35.590 --> 05:38.411
-That's what we do.
-JOSEPH: Not anymore.

05:38.460 --> 05:41.111
You compromised me
in front of the sheriff.

05:41.160 --> 05:42.764
I've never lied to Bill before.

05:43.210 --> 05:46.168
-Never say never.
-It wasn't even worth it.

05:46.210 --> 05:48.292
See, that's the thing
that I don't understand.

05:48.340 --> 05:50.729
Why would you push me
to lie for this?

05:50.780 --> 05:52.429
You got in a fight. So what?

05:52.480 --> 05:54.163
They would have sent you home
for, like, a couple of weeks.

05:54.220 --> 05:56.176
They weren't going to fire you!

05:56.920 --> 05:58.569
I don't have
the greatest track record.

05:59.920 --> 06:00.955
These things pile up.

06:01.440 --> 06:02.657
[gate buzzes]

06:03.790 --> 06:05.314
Besides, that's not the point.

06:05.360 --> 06:06.577
What is the point?

06:06.620 --> 06:08.963
The point is
I would have done that for you.

06:09.020 --> 06:10.578
You shouldn't have to!

06:11.580 --> 06:12.626
MINNICK: Open it up.

06:17.850 --> 06:19.841
Come outta here, boot.
We gotta go.

06:19.900 --> 06:21.982
-What's up?
-They're killing CIs.

06:22.460 --> 06:24.018
-Who did?
-That's why we gotta go.

06:28.380 --> 06:29.460
You know, this suits you.

06:30.950 --> 06:32.998
I don't know the full story,
and I really don't care.

06:33.950 --> 06:36.214
I want you to
leave him alone, Carter.

06:37.700 --> 06:39.565
Don't bring him down
to your level.

06:39.610 --> 06:40.918
He's better than that.

06:48.840 --> 06:49.966
You need to do more.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.568
We've tapped into
our life savings

06:51.620 --> 06:53.019
to have you fight and win.

06:53.060 --> 06:54.402
This is unacceptable.

06:55.190 --> 06:56.441
I beg you, please tell me

06:56.500 --> 06:58.661
there's something
more that you can do.

07:01.150 --> 07:02.196
Okay.

07:03.510 --> 07:04.977
These kids deserve
more than just an appeal.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.411
I'll call you back.

07:09.510 --> 07:11.114
You lost, didn't you?

07:11.900 --> 07:13.117
I don't wanna leave.

07:14.250 --> 07:15.512

07:21.350 --> 07:23.739
We're never gonna
stop fighting for you, okay?

07:28.310 --> 07:30.130
-LONDON: Bill.
-BILL: I can't.

07:30.180 --> 07:31.351
It's important.

07:35.710 --> 07:37.666
Sheriff, nice of you
to fit me in

07:37.710 --> 07:39.314
between press conferences.

07:39.370 --> 07:41.713
-Talk.
-KING: You should have
conferred with us

07:41.760 --> 07:43.011
about the whistleblower program.

07:43.070 --> 07:44.492
Oh, don't worry, it's free.

07:44.550 --> 07:46.415
I really don't have time
for this right now.

07:46.460 --> 07:48.246
_ I know someone's
killing your Informants.

07:49.860 --> 07:51.464
It's their own people
taking 'em out.

07:52.470 --> 07:55.906
Which means someone's putting
their identities in the open.

07:55.950 --> 07:57.554
Who would have that information?

07:58.390 --> 08:00.950
If I were to guess,
someone on the inside.

08:01.390 --> 08:02.823
KING:
That's what I thought, too.

08:02.870 --> 08:04.770
So I made a formal request
for Federal Oversight

08:04.830 --> 08:06.252
until the matter can be handled.

08:06.310 --> 08:07.993
-You what?
-The FBI will be stepping in

08:08.050 --> 08:09.176
to lead the investigation.

08:09.220 --> 08:10.619
The hell they will.

08:10.660 --> 08:12.525
Your discretionary funding
will also be suspended

08:12.570 --> 08:14.356
until the investigation
is completed.

08:14.840 --> 08:17.570
You've obviously lost control
of the people you manage.

08:17.620 --> 08:19.611
So this is your answer,
sanctions,

08:19.670 --> 08:21.888
while I've got good men
and women out there

08:21.930 --> 08:23.795
being hunted down like animals?

08:24.240 --> 08:27.755
These people risked their lives
to help this department.

08:28.630 --> 08:32.509
Well, I think I just added
a new plank to my campaign.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.500
No more budgetary
oversight for you

08:35.550 --> 08:37.506
and your boot lickers.

08:37.950 --> 08:39.247
Go bother Parks and Rec.

08:39.300 --> 08:40.551

08:43.690 --> 08:45.169
He's not hard to find.

08:53.310 --> 08:54.789
Come on. Out with it.

08:55.660 --> 08:56.706
Out with what?

08:57.270 --> 08:58.441
I know you're pissed.

08:59.100 --> 09:00.351
So let me have it already.

09:01.010 --> 09:02.568
I'm not letting you
have anything.

09:04.410 --> 09:06.970
What, is this some kinda
T.O. reverse psychology crap?

09:07.630 --> 09:08.665
MINNICK: N0.

09:09.330 --> 09:10.809
You lied to Bill, so...

09:10.850 --> 09:12.932
Just wondering how long
you gonna sit with that.

09:13.590 --> 09:15.148
Because your relationship
with Bill

09:15.200 --> 09:16.895
isn't the only thing
you could lose.

Hey, baby. What's up?

09:31.390 --> 09:33.346
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't tell me that.

09:35.960 --> 09:37.564
Well, we can file
for an appeal, right?

09:43.490 --> 09:44.661
Damn it!

09:44.710 --> 09:45.870
-You okay?
-No.

09:47.280 --> 09:49.623
How can I help?
Can I help?

09:49.670 --> 09:51.456
Afraid not, Bishop.
Only one thing I need

09:51.500 --> 09:52.535
and it ain't gonna be pretty.

needs to be higher, Mom.

Do you like performing
in front of people?

10:05.640 --> 10:07.073
PAULA: No, not really.

Ah, I guess that's why
I'm a surgeon.

10:09.080 --> 10:10.945
Most of the time
I have an audience of one

10:11.000 --> 10:13.082
and they're usually
under anesthesia.

10:13.870 --> 10:17.306
I kind of like it
but I'm nervous.

10:17.350 --> 10:20.080
Maggie, listen to me closely.

If anything goes wrong,

if the music stops,

Yeah?

-What is it?

10:35.850 --> 10:37.533
BISHOP: Sheriff,
there's an issue with Cade

10:37.590 --> 10:39.148
I thought you should
be made aware of.

10:40.160 --> 10:42.458
-What sort of issue?
-Teresa called,

10:42.510 --> 10:43.761
it sounds like
the judge ruled against them

10:43.810 --> 10:44.936
in the custody battle.

10:46.730 --> 10:48.072
Let me take care of Cade.

10:48.900 --> 10:51.460
You work on notifying
every CI you can

10:51.520 --> 10:52.908
that they're in danger.

10:52.950 --> 10:53.996
Yes, sir.

11:02.740 --> 11:04.560
[telephone ringing]

11:06.050 --> 11:07.221
Sally's Pawn Shop.

11:14.150 --> 11:16.141
Well, I think we got
something like that.

11:16.190 --> 11:17.316
What's your budget?

11:20.940 --> 11:22.100
[Sally laughing]

11:22.150 --> 11:23.765
This isn't a charity...

11:26.940 --> 11:28.589
[glass shatters]

11:37.390 --> 11:38.687
[groans]

11:49.750 --> 11:51.263
I've been dirty

11:51.310 --> 11:52.618
I got clean

11:55.270 --> 11:57.750
I've seen things
you've never seen...

11:59.540 --> 12:03.453
Yeah, I spend my money
how I want

12:05.070 --> 12:09.109
When I see your face
I need it gone...

12:10.160 --> 12:11.889
Who called,
Teresa or Bishop?

12:13.340 --> 12:14.375
Both, actually.

12:21.470 --> 12:22.903
I haven't touched it yet.

12:24.390 --> 12:26.085
But you walked your ass in here,

12:26.130 --> 12:27.472
sat down, and ordered.

12:28.660 --> 12:30.525
I'd say you're already
half in the bag.

12:31.140 --> 12:33.176
I'm thinking I never
see those kids again, Bill.

12:33.880 --> 12:35.222
They're gone.

12:35.270 --> 12:36.578
Kids or no kids...

12:39.060 --> 12:40.095
this won't help.

12:44.190 --> 12:45.589
So what's left?

12:45.630 --> 12:47.939
-The choice.
-It ain't mine.

12:48.370 --> 12:49.758
Sobriety or nothing.

12:51.460 --> 12:53.451
-Call it.
-It's not that easy, Bill.

12:53.510 --> 12:55.239
Yes, it is. Cade.

12:55.900 --> 12:58.596
The kids. The judge.
You can't control that.

12:58.640 --> 12:59.686
None of it.

13:00.120 --> 13:01.724
Remember what you do have.

13:03.730 --> 13:04.901
An amazing wife,

13:05.910 --> 13:07.252
a baby on the way.

13:09.650 --> 13:11.379
It's everything
that you wanted, brother.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.083
Come on, let's go home.

13:14.570 --> 13:16.788
And in the morning,
we'll find out who did this,

13:17.920 --> 13:19.831
we'll save the Mayor,
God willing,

13:19.880 --> 13:22.007
and celebrate
my daughter's qumceaera.

13:22.670 --> 13:24.274
You gonna be able to do that?

13:27.370 --> 13:28.405
I can do that.

13:29.240 --> 13:30.400
You can do anything.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.235
Except this.

13:34.160 --> 13:35.195
Come on.

13:43.820 --> 13:45.037
JOSEPH: ...those two shots.

13:45.080 --> 13:46.945
[siren wailing]

13:48.740 --> 13:49.775
Thank you.

13:51.090 --> 13:52.773
MINNICK: She went _out
just like she came in.

13:54.610 --> 13:55.998
Any video from inside?

13:56.050 --> 13:58.041
Yeah, but she hadn't updated
the system in years.

13:58.530 --> 14:00.304
Image was low quality
and he was wearing a mask.

14:01.010 --> 14:02.705
I'm tired of losin' people.

14:05.880 --> 14:07.142
[line ringing]

14:08.450 --> 14:10.532
-[cell phone ringing]
-Go ahead, Minnick.

14:10.580 --> 14:12.138
Pawn Shop Sally's gone.

14:14.150 --> 14:15.629
I'm sorry.

14:15.680 --> 14:16.578
MINNICK: Yeah, we'll have
time for all that

14:16.630 --> 14:18.063
when this is all over, Sheriff.

14:18.110 --> 14:19.543
Right now, we need to
focus on finding the Mayor.

14:19.590 --> 14:21.023
Do you think he's still alive?

14:21.070 --> 14:23.334
Oh, he's alive
until a body drops,

14:23.770 --> 14:25.112
which won't be any time soon

14:25.160 --> 14:26.468
if he has anything
to say about it.

14:26.510 --> 14:27.727
What do you mean?

14:27.770 --> 14:30.682
Mayor's the most connected
CI we have.

14:30.730 --> 14:32.425
Whoever's got him,
they're gonna wanna get

14:32.480 --> 14:34.129
some of that knowledge
before they kill him.

14:35.130 --> 14:36.381
That buys us a little time.

14:37.780 --> 14:38.826
[sighs]

14:42.090 --> 14:44.695
MAN: Hey, big dog.
We need transit lines.

14:44.750 --> 14:47.651
Who's moving
product where and when.

14:48.710 --> 14:50.052
That's none of your business.

14:52.020 --> 14:53.089
[coughs]

14:54.760 --> 14:56.887
[upbeat music playing]

14:58.940 --> 15:00.419
PAULA:
Everyone look happy.

15:00.460 --> 15:01.893
The quinceaera!

15:02.330 --> 15:04.981
Suki? Hello?
No phone, put it away.

15:05.030 --> 15:06.895
All right, come on.
We'll take selfies later.

15:07.420 --> 15:08.466
Smile, Mags.

15:09.030 --> 15:10.019
Big mile.

15:10.080 --> 15:11.900
Lower your chin.
Lower your chin.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.772
It's beautiful.
And flowers, I love it.

15:15.560 --> 15:16.811
Smile.

15:16.870 --> 15:18.690
Aw. Beautiful.

15:18.740 --> 15:21.174
Oh, and, Suki, relax your smile.
You're too tight.

15:21.220 --> 15:23.825
Mom, it feels weird
taking our pictures
without Dad here.

15:23.870 --> 15:25.303
I know, but he's
gonna be at the mass

15:25.350 --> 15:26.954
and you're gonna have
beautiful pictures with him

15:27.010 --> 15:29.001
at the quinceaera,
which is more important.

15:29.050 --> 15:30.836
All right, thank you, girls.
Now I want a picture

15:30.880 --> 15:31.960
of the three generations

15:32.010 --> 15:33.409
of the Reyes women
striking a pose.

15:35.020 --> 15:36.089
I wanna show my leg.

15:36.150 --> 15:37.185
Yes.

15:40.850 --> 15:42.238
CARTER:
Hey. There's the man.

15:44.680 --> 15:45.977
I didn't get a chance to finish

15:46.030 --> 15:47.679
what I wanted to say
to you before.

15:47.720 --> 15:49.722
-Before when?
-CARTER: Back in the pen.

15:49.770 --> 15:53.069
When, uh, Principal Hollister
sent the two of us to detention.

15:56.730 --> 15:59.255
Got interrupted before I could
tell you how grateful I am,

16:00.170 --> 16:01.865
so I wanna make it official.

16:01.910 --> 16:03.343
Let me buy you your ink.

16:04.390 --> 16:05.652
What?

16:06.530 --> 16:07.565
Come on.

16:08.220 --> 16:09.482
You're one of the Lions now.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.005
It's gonna look great on you.

16:13.580 --> 16:14.615
I don't know, man.

16:15.060 --> 16:16.266
A tattoo is, uh, pretty--

16:16.320 --> 16:17.571
Permanent?

16:17.620 --> 16:19.178
Yeah, that's kinda the point.

16:21.060 --> 16:23.494
Same way being brothers
in a family is permanent.

16:23.980 --> 16:24.969
Look, man,

16:25.680 --> 16:26.715
you had my back,

16:27.460 --> 16:29.678
and from now on,
we're gonna have yours.

16:30.290 --> 16:31.450
I'll have to think about it.

16:39.860 --> 16:41.908
[organ music playing]

16:55.570 --> 16:58.528
Que Dios te de
el roco del cielo

16:58.580 --> 17:00.923
y la requisa de la tierra.

17:00.970 --> 17:03.495
Que las naciones te sigan

17:03.540 --> 17:06.008
y las personas
se inclinen ante ti.

17:06.060 --> 17:09.234
Paula.
Where's Bill?

17:09.280 --> 17:13.671
Los que te maldicen
sean maldecidos.

17:13.720 --> 17:15.062
Y los que te bendijeron

17:15.990 --> 17:18.026
sean bendecidos.

17:19.860 --> 17:22.374
Heavenly Father, I thank You
for the gift of life.

17:22.820 --> 17:24.333
-For creating me
in your image...
-[cell phone buzzing]

17:24.390 --> 17:25.812
...and likeness
and for calling me

17:25.870 --> 17:27.599
to be your daughter
through baptism.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.609
Since you are my model of faith,

17:30.650 --> 17:32.129
-help me continue learning...
-[buzzing continues]

17:32.180 --> 17:33.477
...what I need to be
a good woman...

17:33.530 --> 17:34.827
[whispering]
Where are you?

17:34.870 --> 17:36.485
BILL: The last place
I wanna be right now.

17:36.530 --> 17:38.748
Curtis is still alive, Paula.

17:38.790 --> 17:39.745
I can find him.

17:39.790 --> 17:41.348
Then that's what
you have to do.

17:41.400 --> 17:44.221
No matter what, I'll be there
for Maggie tonight, I swear.

17:44.280 --> 17:46.180
I know you will.
Just be safe.

17:46.230 --> 17:48.050
You tell her I love her, okay?

17:48.110 --> 17:49.441
She knows.

18:24.750 --> 18:27.059
[footsteps approaching]

18:28.840 --> 18:30.364
BILL: I don't have
a lot of time to talk.

18:33.590 --> 18:34.978
I came to apologize, sir.

18:35.020 --> 18:36.578
Well, you can drop the apology.

18:37.980 --> 18:39.106
Just tell me the truth.

18:40.680 --> 18:42.159
That guy that Carter beat up
didn't say anything racist.

18:42.730 --> 18:43.936
That was a lie.

18:43.990 --> 18:45.412
He beat him up
for no good reason.

18:46.420 --> 18:47.944
But you backed him up anyway.

18:48.430 --> 18:49.465
Yes, sir.

18:50.080 --> 18:52.253
-And I don't know why.
-Well, I do.

18:52.690 --> 18:53.736
Peer pressure.

18:55.480 --> 18:57.129
I knew you were lying
from the minute
you opened your mouth.

18:59.090 --> 19:01.866
The problem
is that Carter and his group

19:02.350 --> 19:03.214
are not your peers.

19:03.270 --> 19:04.350
They shouldn't be, anyway.

19:07.140 --> 19:08.129
You hurt your arm?

19:08.750 --> 19:09.796
No, sir, I'm fine.

19:11.190 --> 19:12.441
What's gonna happen to Carter?

19:12.490 --> 19:14.924
Well, he'll be suspended
and reprimanded.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.623
Then there might be
some blowback for your honesty.

19:19.150 --> 19:20.139
Look”.

19:21.240 --> 19:23.288
we all get tested
in life, Joseph.

19:24.420 --> 19:26.149
I'd say this one's
for both of us.

19:26.990 --> 19:28.241
I won't lie to you again.

19:30.860 --> 19:31.895
I know you won't.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.251
RILEY: Got a minute?

19:40.300 --> 19:42.518
Would it matter if I didn't?
[scoffs]

19:42.570 --> 19:44.470
You just don't seem to listen,
do you?

19:44.530 --> 19:45.952
RILEY: Mm-hmm.

19:46.010 --> 19:47.352
I came in to gloat.

19:48.010 --> 19:48.999
Character flaw of mine.

19:49.050 --> 19:50.039
One of many.

19:50.100 --> 19:51.704
I'm on the edge of my seat.

19:51.750 --> 19:54.310
Well, what I've got
might just put you on the floor.

19:54.800 --> 19:56.449
You got somethin' to say,
you say it.

19:56.490 --> 19:59.664
Actually, it's Detective Johnson
who's been talking.

20:00.280 --> 20:03.363
Names, mostly, uh, deputies,

20:03.410 --> 20:06.288
officers, unregistered CIs.

20:06.940 --> 20:09.454
All part of the rot
inside this county.

20:09.510 --> 20:11.728
-Oh, my God.
-What?

20:11.770 --> 20:13.761
You have no idea
what you've done.

20:16.690 --> 20:17.941
Bill, what?

20:21.870 --> 20:23.770
-We've got a problem.
-What's going on?

20:23.830 --> 20:25.127
Do you know what
Johnson's been giving her?

20:25.180 --> 20:27.523
I have every right
to talk to my client.

20:27.570 --> 20:29.743
-Confidentia| informants, Jerry.
-What?

20:29.790 --> 20:32.008
Oh, come on,
were you two born yesterday?

20:32.050 --> 20:33.438
He's given me five so far.

20:33.490 --> 20:34.969
And you know what?
I'm gonna get more

20:35.010 --> 20:36.261
after he signs the deal
this afternoon.

20:36.320 --> 20:38.049
-You are a reckless, stupid--
-Bill. Bill!

20:40.540 --> 20:42.269
Four of those five informants

20:42.320 --> 20:44.140
are already dead.

20:44.190 --> 20:45.532
What?

20:47.200 --> 20:49.100
Here I was trying to figure out
how they were all tied together.

20:49.590 --> 20:52.457
I'd cuff you right now
if I wasn't too mad
to see straight.

20:52.990 --> 20:54.594
My people didn't leak
those names, Bill.

20:54.640 --> 20:57.108
Well, you're about to scour
the Earth to find out who did.

20:57.160 --> 20:59.424
-I'm going to Johnson.
-The hell you are!

20:59.470 --> 21:01.028
Go back to the eighth floor

21:01.080 --> 21:03.298
and figure out
everyone in your office

21:03.340 --> 21:05.035
that has access to those names.

21:05.080 --> 21:06.126
That's what you're gonna do.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.729
-You watch her, Jerry.
-You got it.

21:09.790 --> 21:10.950
BILL: And call County.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.171
Tell 'em to have
Johnson ready for me

21:12.220 --> 21:13.653
-by the time I arrive.
-LONDON: Okay.

21:13.700 --> 21:14.917
You are done.

21:18.050 --> 21:19.096
Get me County.

21:21.670 --> 21:23.058
[gate buzzes]

21:24.320 --> 21:26.231
[footsteps approaching]

21:34.510 --> 21:36.319
I just found out
you've been giving the names

21:36.380 --> 21:38.063
of CIs to your attorney.

21:38.120 --> 21:39.599
Why would you do that?

21:39.640 --> 21:41.767
I'm just cooperating
with the investigation.

21:41.820 --> 21:43.549
Someone must've ratted.

21:43.600 --> 21:45.420
You decided to out 'em anyway?

21:46.170 --> 21:47.205
They haven't been outed.

21:48.480 --> 21:50.129
My attorney is holding the list
in confidence.

21:50.170 --> 21:51.649
Deep in a hidden vault, right?

21:52.180 --> 21:53.306
Something like that.

21:54.660 --> 21:57.083
Then how come your old CIs
are turning up dead

21:57.140 --> 21:58.300
all over town?

22:00.750 --> 22:02.138
Hold _on a second.
Wait a minute.

22:02.930 --> 22:04.830
I had nothing to do
with anything like that.

22:06.800 --> 22:09.109
I need the names
of everyone on that list.

22:09.710 --> 22:11.325
How do I know
this isn't a trick?

22:12.200 --> 22:13.497
Why should I cooperate with you?

22:14.020 --> 22:16.159
'Cause once upon a time
you wore a badge.

22:16.200 --> 22:18.065
You can take that badge off,

22:19.380 --> 22:21.632
but what it represents,
it sticks to ya.

22:21.680 --> 22:23.591
Like a guilty conscience.

22:23.640 --> 22:25.949
You used to be
one of the good guys, Johnson.

22:27.430 --> 22:28.852
I still am, Sheriff.

22:29.520 --> 22:31.556
I know you're lookin'
to cut a deal with Riley.

22:32.910 --> 22:36.300
But if dangling that list
of C15 is your bargaining chip,

22:37.530 --> 22:39.179
it's gone sideways, man.

22:39.920 --> 22:41.649
I wanna know
who put that list out.

22:43.100 --> 22:45.352
They have the Mayor.
He means something to me.

22:47.970 --> 22:49.403
Last time I was here,

22:49.450 --> 22:51.315
we talked about
when you're in too deep,

22:51.800 --> 22:53.711
right and wrong
get all mixed together.

22:54.540 --> 22:56.269
Now you strayed
from the right path,

22:56.330 --> 22:57.547
that's for sure.

22:57.980 --> 23:00.801
But the path
is where it always was

23:02.200 --> 23:03.986
you just need to
find your way back to it.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.079
Now'd be a good time to start.

23:11.470 --> 23:12.641
[sighs]

23:14.870 --> 23:17.600
There's a plant
in the DA's office.

23:29.710 --> 23:32.099
One of Riley's campaign managers
is the leak.

23:33.060 --> 23:34.709
He's a plant for the Alphas.

23:34.760 --> 23:36.182
Riley's on with us.

23:36.240 --> 23:37.628
The hell do you want?

23:37.670 --> 23:38.750
Give me the name, Bill.

23:39.200 --> 23:41.270
-I'|| fix this.
-You're too late.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.449
Well, whoever did it,
I promise you,

23:46.510 --> 23:48.193
I'm gonna bury them
under the jail.

23:50.420 --> 23:51.819
So where do we find the Mayor?

23:51.860 --> 23:52.986
I'll hit you back.

23:55.170 --> 23:56.421

23:57.080 --> 23:58.604
What's going on?

23:58.650 --> 24:00.902
The Alphas still have that
little house out in oil country?

24:00.960 --> 24:02.086
Baldwin Hills, yeah.

24:02.780 --> 24:04.259
I think they got Curtis.

24:04.310 --> 24:05.436
I'm heading there now.

24:05.480 --> 24:07.209
Bishop and I'll meet you there.

24:59.540 --> 25:00.666
Hunkered down up in the house.

25:01.670 --> 25:03.183

you take up a position

25:10.770 --> 25:11.759
and cover us.

25:11.810 --> 25:13.061
We're gonna breach.

26:04.950 --> 26:05.985

26:06.600 --> 26:08.556
Get down on the ground now!

Let's go, Cade.

They got the engine block.
It's done.

28:25.830 --> 28:26.910

for a quick trim,

30:19.900 --> 30:21.720
so go easy on the oil, will ya?

30:22.120 --> 30:24.816
You're a better lawman
than you are a comedian.

30:25.560 --> 30:26.777
I won't argue that.

30:30.170 --> 30:31.216
You doin' all right?

30:32.350 --> 30:34.602
No, sir, I am not.

30:35.390 --> 30:36.823
Well, I'm sorry, Curtis.

-This one's on me.
-CURTIS: Like hell.

30:40.310 --> 30:42.961
You think the last sheriff
would've saved my ass?

30:43.620 --> 30:44.837
Let me tell you one thing.

30:45.880 --> 30:47.871
You better keep this job,

30:47.930 --> 30:50.182

are gone.

31:06.290 --> 31:07.939
It's over, Carter.
I'm done.

31:07.990 --> 31:10.117
No. No, no, no, no.
Nothing is done.

31:10.170 --> 31:11.865
That's what you don't
understand about this.

31:11.910 --> 31:13.252
I wanted to help you understand.

31:13.300 --> 31:14.551
Understand what?

31:15.090 --> 31:16.569
That I have to lie to you?

31:16.610 --> 31:18.214
What comes next, Carter?

31:18.260 --> 31:19.693
I got suspended.

31:19.740 --> 31:21.389
Six weeks. No pay.

31:21.440 --> 31:22.828
That's not on me!

31:24.490 --> 31:26.572
There is no you!

31:26.620 --> 31:29.225
There's only us
and there's them.

31:33.710 --> 31:34.756
So...

31:36.670 --> 31:37.750
choose carefully.

31:39.330 --> 31:40.410
I already have.

31:45.770 --> 31:46.805
This isn't over.

31:47.810 --> 31:48.856
It is.

31:49.730 --> 31:50.981
You just don't know it yet.

See you in six weeks.

32:17.930 --> 32:19.659
I was just getting ready
to call you.

32:19.720 --> 32:21.142
I wanted to say this
to you face-to-face.

32:21.200 --> 32:22.929
No, let me go first.

32:22.980 --> 32:24.322
I think that we worked
pretty well together

32:24.370 --> 32:25.758
this afternoon

32:25.810 --> 32:28.119
and I would like to
work out a deal

32:28.770 --> 32:31.238
where we collaborate

32:31.290 --> 32:33.679
on a more permanent capacity
in the future.

32:33.730 --> 32:34.856
What do you think?

32:34.900 --> 32:35.946
I'm not interested.

32:37.340 --> 32:38.557
You don't even wanna
think about it for a minute?

32:38.600 --> 32:40.420
A member of your staff,
Nico Collins,

32:40.480 --> 32:42.994
leaked _the _names
of our criminal informants.

32:43.040 --> 32:45.952
The Alphas must've had something
over him or someone he knows.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.003
Yes, not the first plant
and not gonna be the last.

32:49.050 --> 32:50.654
But he was arrested
and removed.

32:50.700 --> 32:53.612
That's irrelevant.
Here's what's gonna happen.

32:53.660 --> 32:55.059
You're gonna
withdraw from the race.

32:55.660 --> 32:58.356
I had nothing to do with
the leaking of that information.

33:00.320 --> 33:02.663
If not for your
politically motivated handling

33:02.710 --> 33:03.847
of the Johnson case,

33:03.890 --> 33:05.494
four people
would be alive today.

33:05.540 --> 33:06.973
So here's
what you're going to do.

33:07.020 --> 33:08.715
You're gonna withdraw
from the race.

33:08.760 --> 33:10.022
You're gonna drop
your investigation

33:10.070 --> 33:11.412
into the Sheriff's Department

33:11.460 --> 33:13.018
and you're going to resign
as District Attorney

33:13.070 --> 33:14.025
of Los Angeles County.

33:14.070 --> 33:15.503
You have no ev--

33:15.550 --> 33:17.632
You will do this
within 48 hours from now.

33:19.470 --> 33:20.596
Or I will arrest you.

33:59.470 --> 34:00.767
PAULA:
Oh, he will be here.

34:00.820 --> 34:02.162

he's gonna be here.

34:02.210 --> 34:03.336
Pasame el vino, por favor.

34:03.380 --> 34:04.859
Calm down.

34:07.650 --> 34:09.606
-Mom. Willlere is he?
- i.

34:09.650 --> 34:10.958
Your dad wouldn't miss it
for the world.

34:11.000 --> 34:14.083
He's fighting his way over here
just for you.

34:14.740 --> 34:15.866
So have fun.

34:24.450 --> 34:25.485
I told you.

34:50.870 --> 34:52.349
I heard you were
looking for these.

35:04.100 --> 35:06.056
I've been waiting 15 years
for this, Mags.

35:09.150 --> 35:11.050
I wouldn't have missed it
for anything in the world.

35:11.450 --> 35:13.884
[mariachi music playing]

35:39.780 --> 35:43.170
You have grown into a beautiful,
smart, fierce woman.

For what?

36:36.320 --> 36:37.480
That tat.

36:38.840 --> 36:41.058
Well, I think I'm gonna keep it.

-Definitely.

No.

Well, I guess that leaves
just you and me, then.

40:59.630 --> 41:00.665
May the best man win.

41:02.850 --> 41:03.885
Hey, Jerry.

41:05.110 --> 41:06.145
Stay for a drink.

41:08.070 --> 41:09.105
Open bar.

41:09.550 --> 41:10.938
If you insist, Sheriff.

41:11.510 --> 41:12.761
I gotta change.

41:24.480 --> 41:25.515
This is perfect.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.046
PAULA: Thank you.

41:29.790 --> 41:31.473
Thank you for bringing my suit.

41:31.880 --> 41:33.745
Well, thanks for
bringing yourself.

41:34.490 --> 41:35.832
Ah, that's the least I could do.

41:36.530 --> 41:37.519
I know.

41:38.270 --> 41:39.919
This is the man you married.

41:42.280 --> 41:44.441
And I would do it
a million times over.

41:46.060 --> 41:47.106
I love you.

41:49.500 --> 41:51.104
I love you, Bill Hollister.

41:53.720 --> 41:54.857
You know what you are?

41:55.600 --> 41:56.589
What's that?

41:58.250 --> 42:00.298
You're the hero
no one saw coming.

42:02.600 --> 42:03.817
Except me.

42:04.560 --> 42:05.606
BILL: Hmm.

42:05.650 --> 42:10.383
Whenever I let 'em

42:11.260 --> 42:14.559
I climb through

42:15.350 --> 42:19.047
The skylight

42:19.100 --> 42:23.799
Whatever you're feeling
is all right

42:25.490 --> 42:27.924
Let you

42:29.060 --> 42:31.494
Let go...

42:31.540 --> 42:34.156
BILL: I've learned that being sheriff of Los Angeles County

42:34.200 --> 42:36.976
is a lot like being a father.

42:37.030 --> 42:39.248
You worry every day if the decisions you're making

42:39.290 --> 42:41.508
are the right ones.

42:41.550 --> 42:43.598
If your choices
will lead to a better future

42:43.640 --> 42:45.904
for the people you're in charge of protecting.

42:49.690 --> 42:51.214
You've gotta have faith.

42:51.260 --> 42:52.215
And trust.

42:53.960 --> 42:55.473
That goes both ways.

42:57.960 --> 43:00.087
I love my daughter,

43:00.140 --> 43:01.869
and I love this county.

43:02.970 --> 43:04.358
Destiny brought us together.

43:05.880 --> 43:08.701
And I'll be damned
if I won't fight for both

43:08.760 --> 43:10.227
until the bitter end.
