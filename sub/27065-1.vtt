00:56.961 --> 00:57.961
<i>An outbreak.</i>

00:58.360 --> 01:00.028
<i>Many died or wouldn't.</i>

01:01.060 --> 01:02.258
<i>Highly-trained units
were formed</i>

01:02.260 --> 01:03.261

01:04.027 --> 01:05.394

01:09.194 --> 01:10.428

01:11.494 --> 01:13.458
<i>Walker was a police officer
in Terminal City</i>

01:13.460 --> 01:14.661
<i>for many years,</i>

[insects chirping]

01:22.728 --> 01:23.995
<i>But I got my own problems.</i>

01:26.227 --> 01:29.261
<i>My parents,
they got infected early.</i>

01:33.394 --> 01:35.162
<i>The world went to hell
for me years ago.</i>

01:37.028 --> 01:38.862

[moaning]

[growling]

02:16.027 --> 02:17.694
[man] Step! Step!

02:18.127 --> 02:19.727
Stay in step, maggots!

02:20.493 --> 02:22.094
Keep in step, you maggots!

02:31.028 --> 02:33.726
Since the outbreak,
our company has become

02:33.728 --> 02:35.794
the biggest supplier
of personal weapons.

02:36.328 --> 02:39.328
Every household owns at least
12 guns made by Cyglobe.

02:40.094 --> 02:42.794
And our TV network
is the most watched worldwide.

02:44.094 --> 02:47.061
It really is one world.
One Cyglobe.

02:50.794 --> 02:51.959
Aren't you proud?

02:51.961 --> 02:53.192
Well, of course, we're proud.

02:53.194 --> 02:54.825
[man] Yes, ma'am.
We're very proud.

02:54.827 --> 02:56.694
But the truth is
we need to expand.

02:57.094 --> 02:58.994
We can only sell guns
for so long.

02:59.828 --> 03:01.859
Which is why
finding the cure is the key.

03:01.861 --> 03:02.862
The cure?

03:03.426 --> 03:04.427
To the outbreak?

03:05.360 --> 03:06.962
If we could control
the cure's roll out,

03:07.161 --> 03:09.358
we can set the price
and the release date.

03:09.360 --> 03:11.093
Yeah. I mean, do we really
think that we're

03:11.095 --> 03:12.891
going to find a cure?
I've heard nothing from our...

03:12.893 --> 03:14.894
We have labs in Terminal City.

03:15.326 --> 03:16.328
That's true.

03:17.727 --> 03:19.294
Our stock prices are gonna soar.

03:20.295 --> 03:22.424
This is why I am in
a pay grade all by myself.

03:22.426 --> 03:23.428
What?

03:23.860 --> 03:25.394
We got an email
from Terminal City.

03:25.827 --> 03:27.094
Tara Conlan at the lab.

03:29.860 --> 03:31.129
Okay. That's it, gentlemen.

03:33.794 --> 03:34.795
Thank you.

03:40.427 --> 03:43.095
- What did the email say?
- To call her right away.

03:43.494 --> 03:45.225
- That's it?
- Oh, she mentioned

03:45.227 --> 03:46.927
they may have found
the sequences.

03:47.860 --> 03:50.159
So why didn't you start
with that information?

03:50.161 --> 03:52.294
I... I'm sorry.

03:53.994 --> 03:55.094
Okay. Get the general.

03:55.393 --> 03:56.395
Yes, ma'am.

[insects chirping]

04:14.961 --> 04:16.128
Chris Northon?

04:21.226 --> 04:22.827
What can I do for you guys?

04:24.161 --> 04:27.325
We're CSU,
Contagion Special Unit.

04:27.327 --> 04:29.992
Why... There's no one
infected here.

04:29.994 --> 04:31.129
That's for sure.

04:31.461 --> 04:33.092
Chris, we're here to offer you

04:33.094 --> 04:34.727
a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

04:34.960 --> 04:36.761
Have you heard of the
Dead Trigger Initiative?

04:37.928 --> 04:38.927
Yeah. I know about it.

04:39.359 --> 04:40.428
I've seen the commercials.

04:40.961 --> 04:42.459
We only select the best.

04:42.461 --> 04:45.062
And, Chris...
you are the best.

04:45.761 --> 04:48.361
We pay generously.
Have you been to Hawaii?

04:48.828 --> 04:51.095
What do you say, kid?
You wanna be a hero?

04:52.894 --> 04:55.361
Yes. You will generously pay me.

04:56.359 --> 04:58.128
Now, tell me more about Hawaii.

04:59.760 --> 05:01.491

[shouting continues]

05:19.027 --> 05:20.360
[cheering]

05:21.293 --> 05:24.360
There you have it.
Today's winner, Samantha Atkins.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.492
And that's how
you win a damn show!

05:27.494 --> 05:28.695
Boom!

05:34.193 --> 05:35.193
So where's my money?

05:36.293 --> 05:37.892
Well, as I was trying to say,
we'd rather give you

05:37.894 --> 05:39.225
a lifetime membership
to the club.

05:39.227 --> 05:41.227
Uh-uh.
Where's my cash?

05:41.960 --> 05:43.759
Well, there wasn't
enough spectators.

05:43.761 --> 05:46.228
You can either take the coupon
or not. It's up to you.

05:46.960 --> 05:48.391
Or, you know,
maybe we can work out

05:48.393 --> 05:50.961
another way for you to make
a little additional money.

05:52.426 --> 05:53.360
[grunts]

05:53.960 --> 05:55.328
[groans]

05:58.060 --> 05:59.160
She robbed me.

06:04.961 --> 06:06.258
- Shit.
- [man] Well, if it ain't

06:06.260 --> 06:08.093
little Ms. Atkins.
We almost gave up

06:08.095 --> 06:09.392
looking for you, Sam.

06:09.394 --> 06:11.894
We've got a nice comfy bed
for you downtown.

06:13.095 --> 06:15.328
Samantha Atkins or is it Sam?

06:16.226 --> 06:17.227
We're CSU.

06:18.193 --> 06:19.827
You've got quite an
impressive rap sheet.

06:20.060 --> 06:22.061
Lot of thefts,
lot of assaults,

06:22.761 --> 06:25.128
obstructing three officers
from performing their duties.

06:26.061 --> 06:28.795
- Wow.
- Four. Have I won something?

06:29.259 --> 06:31.826
Perhaps. We can wipe
your record clean.

06:31.828 --> 06:33.062
Would you like that?

06:36.194 --> 06:37.294
Well, let's get out of here.

06:44.928 --> 06:47.862
[man] Go, go, go,
go, go, go, go.

06:48.360 --> 06:50.161
[music playing]

06:52.360 --> 06:55.962
Guys, no. You have to...
Wait for me.

06:58.227 --> 07:00.994
No. Stop, stop, stop.
Spin...

07:02.493 --> 07:04.059
Here we go. Here we go.

07:04.061 --> 07:07.062
Yeah. Yeah.
You're a big guy, aren't you?

07:08.326 --> 07:09.327
Whoa.

07:10.126 --> 07:11.227
[knocking on door]

07:12.326 --> 07:13.260
[music stops]

07:23.127 --> 07:24.695
We're looking for Daniel Chen.

07:25.227 --> 07:27.761
Daniel? What he do now?

07:28.861 --> 07:31.228
Daniel's not in trouble.
We're CSU.

07:31.427 --> 07:33.424
You're stepson has been chosen

07:33.426 --> 07:35.327
to join an elite group
of soldiers.

07:36.461 --> 07:39.695
Him? He's lazy.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.327
All he does is play
video games in his room

07:42.760 --> 07:45.060
ever since his mother
was killed by those...

07:46.194 --> 07:47.193
I'll do it.

07:48.227 --> 07:49.228
I'll do it.

07:49.828 --> 07:51.160
I'll kill every
last one of them.

08:03.794 --> 08:04.695
Slow down, dawg.

08:05.628 --> 08:07.127
You're gonna give yourself
a heart attack.

08:07.327 --> 08:09.795
Listen, you really don't
wanna do this.

08:10.494 --> 08:11.695
Why is that?

08:12.059 --> 08:13.060
I've been training.

08:14.159 --> 08:15.891
Do you want a shot at the title?

08:15.893 --> 08:17.491
[laughs]

08:17.493 --> 08:18.861
I crack myself up.

08:20.027 --> 08:21.661
You know, funny thing is,
I'll knock your big ass out,

08:21.893 --> 08:23.358
but we're not in
the same weight class.

08:23.360 --> 08:24.261
[chuckles]

08:25.326 --> 08:28.093
[man] You got that right,
punk-ass little thief.

08:28.293 --> 08:30.424
Only training you've been doing
is you've been playing

08:30.426 --> 08:31.427
those games all day.

08:36.058 --> 08:37.059
Look at you.

08:37.427 --> 08:39.828
You stole goggles
and LV420 from me?

08:41.092 --> 08:43.861
- You know what this shit costs?
- My mom needed it.

08:47.026 --> 08:48.160
I don't give a shit.

08:49.960 --> 08:51.661
[siren blares]

08:55.960 --> 08:56.961
You wanna try us?

09:01.394 --> 09:02.327
Who the hell are y'all two?

09:03.094 --> 09:05.761
By the looks of things,
your new best friends.

09:06.159 --> 09:08.327
- Look, I don't need your help.
- Calm down.

09:08.893 --> 09:10.990
We're looking for you,
Gerald Jefferson.

09:10.992 --> 09:12.825
- What'd I do now?
- Nothing yet.

09:12.827 --> 09:13.827
That's the point.

09:14.828 --> 09:15.928
Would you like the opportunity
of a lifetime?

09:28.027 --> 09:29.795

[gun clicks]

10:44.226 --> 10:45.160
[gun clicks]

10:46.828 --> 10:48.492
How the hell do you do
that trick, Walker?

10:48.494 --> 10:50.927
It ain't a trick.
Just luck.

10:59.959 --> 11:00.926
[gunshot]

11:01.794 --> 11:04.894
Goddammit, Walker.
That ain't funny.

11:17.126 --> 11:18.093
[door opens]

11:18.460 --> 11:19.960
Recruits, on your feet.

11:20.493 --> 11:22.093
[Conlan]
Good morning, recruits.

11:22.360 --> 11:23.827
My name is General Conlan.

11:24.260 --> 11:26.394
I'm the commander in chief
of the CSU base.

11:27.461 --> 11:30.794
Five years after day zero.
the first outbreak,

11:31.259 --> 11:32.826
and our world is still at war.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.860
Before you now are two
very important men in your life.

11:36.394 --> 11:38.894
Captain Rockstock.
Captain Kyle Walker.

11:39.794 --> 11:41.392
These men will be your
instructors

11:41.394 --> 11:42.926
from here on forward.

11:51.360 --> 11:52.728
Okay, rookies...

11:55.859 --> 11:56.993
time to get your hands dirty.

12:12.026 --> 12:15.260
Chen, do you wanna become
food for the undead?

12:15.760 --> 12:16.761
[Daniel] No, sir.

12:17.827 --> 12:18.759
[Rockstock] Well, I suggest
you spend less time

12:18.761 --> 12:20.427
with your computer
and more time on cardio.

12:21.259 --> 12:23.093
[Daniel] Sir, how long
do we have to do this?

12:24.094 --> 12:25.094
As long as it takes.

12:26.359 --> 12:27.727
What the hell does that mean?

12:29.427 --> 12:31.361
- [gunshot]
- [screams]

12:38.860 --> 12:40.394
[Walker] These are
your new best friends.

12:42.093 --> 12:43.227
Learn to know them well.

12:43.860 --> 12:45.161
Your very lives depend on it.

12:45.892 --> 12:47.694
Uh, I've never shot a gun
before.

12:48.293 --> 12:49.793
Speak for yourself.

12:50.326 --> 12:51.228
Back in Texas,

12:52.294 --> 12:54.094
I won the DeSoto Rifle
Range Championship at 16.

12:57.260 --> 12:59.662
You're here for one thing
and one thing only...

13:01.893 --> 13:02.893
to kill the dead.

13:05.294 --> 13:07.361
And it's our job to teach you
to kill the dead...

13:08.727 --> 13:09.827
before they kill you.

13:21.494 --> 13:23.662
This is Second
Lieutenant Marchetti.

13:25.360 --> 13:27.061
She can tell you more
about this guy.

13:32.259 --> 13:36.227
One bite, one scratch that
draws blood and you are done.

13:37.959 --> 13:40.193
However, there is a very small
window of opportunity.

13:41.427 --> 13:44.357
Immediately after being bitten,
the infected body part

13:44.359 --> 13:46.093
must be cut off.

13:47.359 --> 13:48.827
[groans]
That's gross.

13:52.094 --> 13:53.994
[Rockstock] Today,
we're training live

13:55.059 --> 13:56.060
with real weapons...

13:59.093 --> 14:00.093
and a real undead.

14:02.827 --> 14:04.694
We'll use weapons
depending on the mission.

14:05.293 --> 14:08.328
Probably an M4 carbine
and colt 911 pistol.

14:11.027 --> 14:12.261
Anyone care to take a shot?

14:17.127 --> 14:18.361
I hear you're quite a shooter.

14:26.460 --> 14:27.660
Impress me.

14:36.760 --> 14:38.161
It's a fine-looking weapon,
Captain.

14:42.093 --> 14:44.860
- [remote beeps]
- [growls]

14:50.094 --> 14:51.093
Oh, shit.

14:51.426 --> 14:52.360
[gunshot]

14:53.826 --> 14:54.960
[gasps]
Holy shit.

14:56.026 --> 14:56.993
[gunshot]

15:12.093 --> 15:14.760
Shika, let me see what you can
do with that sword of yours.

15:15.160 --> 15:18.192
It's not CSU-issue,
but, uh, prove to us

15:18.194 --> 15:19.961
that there's a reason
you're here, soldier.

15:30.260 --> 15:31.260
[Walker] Wait.

15:37.759 --> 15:40.227
Be direct.
Be aggressive.

15:41.826 --> 15:42.826
Or be dead.

15:48.160 --> 15:50.361
Now, I know you how you
lost your family.

15:51.226 --> 15:54.794
Use that pain.
It will save your life one day.

15:59.793 --> 16:01.293
- You're next, Eric.
- [remote beeps]

16:09.360 --> 16:10.360
Bring me the next one.

16:11.560 --> 16:13.227
These beasts have nothing
against a natural-born soldier.

16:13.959 --> 16:14.960
E, behind!

16:15.360 --> 16:17.228
[screams]

16:18.860 --> 16:19.860
[gunshot]

16:20.259 --> 16:22.328
- No!
- [Walker] Hold him tight.

16:22.860 --> 16:25.125
- [Eric] No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Hold still.

16:25.127 --> 16:26.128
[Eric] No, no, no.

16:27.060 --> 16:28.661
[screams]

16:32.227 --> 16:34.360
I mean, what the hell was up
with that Walker dude?

16:35.293 --> 16:36.293
Dude is a stud.

16:36.827 --> 16:37.827
Dude is nuts.

16:38.726 --> 16:40.061
We all better sleep
with one eye open.

16:40.360 --> 16:41.727
He's more like a tortured soul.

16:42.427 --> 16:43.791
How's that?

16:43.793 --> 16:44.957
He's famous.

16:44.959 --> 16:46.660
He's killed more zombies
than anybody.

16:47.193 --> 16:48.193
How do you know that?

16:49.460 --> 16:52.294
I hacked into the CSU system,
looked at all of your records,

16:53.026 --> 16:54.027
including you.

16:54.961 --> 16:55.894
What the hell are you
looking at me for?

16:56.993 --> 16:58.360
Look, I didn't steal that shit.
My cousin did, okay?

17:00.059 --> 17:01.060
[Rockstock] Ten-hut!

17:07.394 --> 17:09.094
This is First Lieutenant
Martinov.

17:09.859 --> 17:12.227
And this is Russian GM-94
grenade launcher.

17:13.194 --> 17:15.357
Unfortunately, the CSU
has a limited supply,

17:15.358 --> 17:17.094
so only one per unit.

17:17.727 --> 17:19.361
It uses a thermobaric grenade.

17:20.727 --> 17:23.961
Blast ranges over ten feet,
6,000 Fahrenheit.

17:24.858 --> 17:26.925
The key is make it count.

17:31.360 --> 17:33.227
[whistles]
Send them in.

17:34.293 --> 17:35.693
[growling]

17:37.492 --> 17:40.660
Lieutenant Martinov's gonna show
us some special skills

17:41.093 --> 17:43.291
that we can learn
in the short time we have here.

17:43.293 --> 17:44.293
Yes, sir.

17:48.027 --> 17:52.395
Recruits, if you do not have
a weapon, you must become one.

18:03.027 --> 18:04.961
[chuckles]

18:05.960 --> 18:07.361
[grunts]

18:14.827 --> 18:15.826
[Sam] Whoa.

18:26.727 --> 18:28.694
[Rockstock] Recruits,
go have a look.

18:29.093 --> 18:30.660
You don't have to tell me twice.

18:35.826 --> 18:36.826
Anything breathing?

18:43.960 --> 18:47.827
[growling]

18:53.059 --> 18:54.327
[explosion]

18:54.826 --> 18:55.826
[gasping]

19:04.793 --> 19:05.794
Get a grip, soldiers.

19:07.959 --> 19:11.394
[Gerald] Woo! Now,
that's what I'm talking about.

19:11.960 --> 19:12.990
I'mma go freshen up.

19:12.992 --> 19:14.191
I advise y'all do
the same thing,

19:14.193 --> 19:15.357
'cause you smell
like zombies ass.

19:15.359 --> 19:16.158
[laughing]

19:16.160 --> 19:18.128
Guys, lots of
improvement today.

19:18.893 --> 19:19.958
- Good job.
- Thank you.

19:19.960 --> 19:20.961
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

19:21.859 --> 19:22.857
- You coming, Daniel?
- Uh, no, I'm good.

19:22.859 --> 19:24.890
I'm gonna get some
extra study in before bed.

19:24.892 --> 19:27.192
- Are you an expert yet?
- I'm getting there.

19:27.194 --> 19:29.224
Come on, Chen,
we got to get away

19:29.226 --> 19:30.693
from all this messed up shit.

19:30.893 --> 19:32.791
No. You guys, I'm fine.

19:32.793 --> 19:35.225
- Go on ahead.
- Dude, you might miss

19:35.227 --> 19:39.727
- something awesome. We insist.
- Gee, okay, fine. Jesus.

19:45.392 --> 19:48.761
- Hey. You okay?
- Yeah.

19:52.492 --> 19:53.793
[music playing]

19:54.126 --> 19:55.127
Tequila time.

19:56.159 --> 19:57.926
Right in the middle pocket.

19:59.960 --> 20:01.391
- Nice shot...
- [Sam] Right.

20:01.393 --> 20:02.858
...for a girl.

20:02.860 --> 20:04.360
This shot's gonna be
even better.

20:07.926 --> 20:09.827
Our boy, Chen, is wasted.

20:10.358 --> 20:12.027
I think this is his first bar.

20:14.160 --> 20:15.927
It's about time
you kids headed back.

20:16.960 --> 20:18.194
Shouldn't you be in bed already?

20:18.992 --> 20:20.791
Excuse me, sir,
I hate to bust your bubble,

20:20.793 --> 20:22.357
but this is no longer
the 1800s.

20:22.359 --> 20:24.293
They got two
free tables over there.

20:25.359 --> 20:27.094
There's plenty of room
for all of us.

20:28.159 --> 20:31.193
Yeah? Well, this is a bar
for real soldiers.

20:31.860 --> 20:34.094
We're soldiers just like you.

20:34.860 --> 20:36.827
No. You're not soldiers.

20:37.260 --> 20:38.327
You're Dead Triggers.

20:39.126 --> 20:40.861
Where do you think
the name comes from?

20:42.126 --> 20:46.193
See, you're Dead Triggers
because you are exactly that.

20:47.326 --> 20:48.693
You are dead already.

20:48.960 --> 20:49.759
What do you mean?

20:51.459 --> 20:53.427
What I mean is you kids
have no chance.

20:54.226 --> 20:58.725
Dead Triggers, you have
the shortest life expectancy

20:58.727 --> 20:59.727
out of any unit.

21:00.359 --> 21:03.091
Dead Triggers, dead meat.

21:03.093 --> 21:04.227
We're an elite unit.

21:04.726 --> 21:06.394
You are the CSU's suicide squad.

21:06.827 --> 21:08.727
And you just keep coming,
don't you, son?

21:09.027 --> 21:10.027
[Sam] Hey.

21:11.193 --> 21:12.192
[crowd] Whoa!

21:12.194 --> 21:14.327
[chuckles]
Really?

21:15.827 --> 21:17.227
[man] Come on, Bobby,
spank that ass.

21:19.359 --> 21:22.292
Recruits, back to base.

21:27.358 --> 21:30.027
Yeah. Why don't you
put them to bed, Walker?

21:31.060 --> 21:32.227
Yeah. Especially that one.

21:40.226 --> 21:41.327
It's not your world anymore.

21:43.225 --> 21:45.894
This enemy is like no other
this country has ever faced.

21:48.325 --> 21:53.359
Our friends, neighbors,
our families.

21:56.893 --> 22:00.827
These kids are the only chance
this country has to survive.

22:04.425 --> 22:05.826
Give them credit for that.

22:24.059 --> 22:26.360
[moaning]

22:46.959 --> 22:47.960
[Tara] <i>Everyone is dead.</i>

22:49.093 --> 22:51.426
<i>Professor Adler is missing,
and so is his team.</i>

22:52.059 --> 22:54.727
<i>And what's left of them
is outside this room.</i>

22:55.860 --> 22:58.457
<i>And I have no way out,
so I will no doubt</i>

22:58.459 --> 22:59.793
<i>be joining them soon.</i>

23:01.060 --> 23:02.060
<i>Signing off.</i>

23:06.226 --> 23:08.061
[howling]

23:13.759 --> 23:15.424
Recruits, your training
has been cut short.

23:15.426 --> 23:16.694
We have a situation.

23:17.827 --> 23:21.727
We lost contact with a CSU unit
and several scientists.

23:22.094 --> 23:23.791
They were spearheading
an investigation

23:23.793 --> 23:24.794
on Terminal Island.

23:25.826 --> 23:27.060
Due to recent deployments,
you're the only ones

23:28.260 --> 23:30.790
available for this mission,
to search for and to rescue

23:30.792 --> 23:33.126
the missing team.
Walker.

23:34.493 --> 23:39.293
As you know, ground zero is the
first place the virus appeared.

23:39.992 --> 23:41.160
The island has been cut off.

23:41.893 --> 23:43.927
We should always anticipate
heavy contact.

23:44.860 --> 23:47.860
There are thousands
of infected in the city.

23:48.358 --> 23:50.961
We couldn't cleanse it with
nuclear or incendiary weapons.

23:51.793 --> 23:53.360
There are still pockets
of survivors there.

23:53.892 --> 23:55.226
People still actually
live there?

23:55.993 --> 23:57.061
An unknown number.

23:58.126 --> 24:00.961
Those who couldn't be saved
or refused to leave.

24:03.093 --> 24:05.394
There are other reasons why
we don't wipe out the island.

24:06.859 --> 24:09.993
Ground zero holds many secrets
that could lead to a cure.

24:10.759 --> 24:12.027
It could reveal its origin.

24:13.293 --> 24:16.761
Terminal City is one big science
experiment gone horribly wrong.

24:17.859 --> 24:20.093
We head into ground
zero by the end of the day.

24:21.093 --> 24:23.427
Are you ready to rescue
your CSU brothers?

24:24.059 --> 24:25.857
[recruits] Sir, yes, sir.

24:25.859 --> 24:27.958
Now, on a more personal level,
my daughter, Tara,

24:27.960 --> 24:29.227
is part of the research team.

24:29.960 --> 24:32.093
She worked with Dr. Adler
for the last year.

24:33.892 --> 24:37.660
[sighs] Find my daughter
and bring her home safely.

24:41.058 --> 24:42.059
Yes, sir.

24:43.226 --> 24:46.193
[helicopter whirring]

25:14.460 --> 25:15.661
Okay. Listen up.

25:16.827 --> 25:19.393
We go in,
search for the missing team,

25:20.058 --> 25:22.192
get them and our asses
out of this damn place.

25:23.392 --> 25:25.359
Stay focused on the mission
at all times.

25:26.827 --> 25:30.727
We try to avoid contact,
so fire only at my command.

25:32.225 --> 25:33.957
I don't want any gung-ho
novs

25:33.959 --> 25:35.024
shooting off widely.

25:35.026 --> 25:36.427
- Understood?
- [recruits] Yes, sir.

25:42.158 --> 25:43.260
This is the real deal.

25:43.959 --> 25:46.490
If you stay close to me,
Rockstock,

25:46.492 --> 25:48.093
and Lieutenant Martinov,

25:48.392 --> 25:49.826
if you know how to follow
orders,

25:50.226 --> 25:51.960
we're all gonna get out safe.

25:59.226 --> 26:02.159
[insects chirping]

26:55.826 --> 26:58.026
Remember, no shooting.

26:58.258 --> 27:00.359
We don't wanna wake up
this entire infested city.

27:01.726 --> 27:02.526
Chen, directions?

27:03.226 --> 27:05.093
Uh... [stammers]
I don't know, Captain.

27:05.926 --> 27:07.661
Take a deep breath
and concentrate.

27:08.827 --> 27:10.290
- Okay. Okay. Uh, I got it.
- [beeping]

27:10.292 --> 27:12.827
It's coming from a building
about half a mile north of here.

27:13.759 --> 27:14.760
Martinov.

27:22.026 --> 27:23.027
Move out.

27:37.092 --> 27:38.793
- [Daniel gasps]
- [gunshots]

27:40.093 --> 27:41.490
What the hell are you firing at?

27:41.492 --> 27:43.059
I... I thought I saw something.

27:43.392 --> 27:45.092
[Rockstock] What did I say?
No shooting.

27:45.459 --> 27:46.693
Thanks a lot, Daniel.

27:47.025 --> 27:50.092
Captain, we got company.

27:53.026 --> 27:55.092
[gunshots]

27:56.359 --> 27:59.727
[growling]

28:21.959 --> 28:22.959
They're everywhere.

28:23.226 --> 28:24.226
Move out.

28:32.493 --> 28:34.193
[zombie growls]

28:37.025 --> 28:38.026
[Walker] Chris, keep up.

28:39.492 --> 28:40.693
Go.

28:43.891 --> 28:44.993
Left. This way. All right.

28:46.760 --> 28:48.160
Barricade the door.
Let's go.

28:48.492 --> 28:49.823
[growling]

28:49.825 --> 28:50.959
Barricade the door.

28:51.493 --> 28:54.124
[grunting]

28:54.126 --> 28:56.394
Get in here. Get in here.

29:00.459 --> 29:01.660
[growling]

29:04.791 --> 29:07.356
What about the missing team?
Picking up a signal?

29:07.358 --> 29:09.356
[Daniel] It seems to be
coming from upstairs.

29:09.358 --> 29:11.726
[growling]

29:18.358 --> 29:19.759
[Marchetti] What happened here?

29:20.125 --> 29:21.959
[Walker] Looks like we
found the missing team.

29:22.758 --> 29:25.226
[growling]

29:28.358 --> 29:30.226
Captain, they're coming.

29:31.392 --> 29:32.457
Fire.

29:32.459 --> 29:34.892
[gunshots]

29:36.791 --> 29:37.792
[growling]

29:43.493 --> 29:44.757
[glass shatters]

29:44.759 --> 29:46.661
You follow me, upstairs.
Let's go.

29:47.825 --> 29:49.093
[glass shatters]

29:49.426 --> 29:51.726
[gunshots]

29:58.226 --> 29:59.227
Come on.

30:00.758 --> 30:01.759
Rockstock!

30:06.326 --> 30:07.326
[gunshot]

30:11.493 --> 30:12.693
Let's go. Go!

30:18.958 --> 30:19.959
[Chris] Help!

30:20.459 --> 30:21.660
I got it.

30:28.859 --> 30:30.191
I could use a little help.

30:30.193 --> 30:31.227
[grunts]

30:32.259 --> 30:33.260
Have a nice flight.

30:33.959 --> 30:34.960
[grunts]

30:36.358 --> 30:38.426
[growling]

30:39.493 --> 30:40.693
[gunshots]

30:41.225 --> 30:42.226
Nice timing, Captain.

30:42.826 --> 30:44.360
Next time, stay in formation.
Go.

30:46.125 --> 30:47.291
[zombie snarls]

30:47.293 --> 30:48.860
[groans]

30:49.193 --> 30:50.394
- [zombie snarls]
- Mother...

30:56.226 --> 30:58.659
[Rockstock screams]

31:03.826 --> 31:06.959
[panting]

31:12.492 --> 31:14.160
Anyone wounded?
Any bites?

31:15.125 --> 31:18.859
Sir, this is a suicide mission.
We should get out of here.

31:20.959 --> 31:21.960
Reload.

31:24.991 --> 31:27.026
We're here on a mission,
to complete the mission.

31:28.193 --> 31:29.260
- Excuse me, guys?
- [beeping]

31:29.759 --> 31:30.824
Now, what is it, kid?

31:30.826 --> 31:32.223
Uh, we're getting
another signal.

31:32.225 --> 31:34.059
There's labs on this floor.

31:34.492 --> 31:36.126
The signal is coming
from over there.

31:36.792 --> 31:37.824
All right.

31:37.826 --> 31:39.260
We still got
possible survivors.

31:39.925 --> 31:40.925
Everyone ready?

31:41.158 --> 31:42.159
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

31:43.226 --> 31:45.027
All right, Dead Triggers,
show me what you can do.

31:46.825 --> 31:47.825
Let's go.

31:49.791 --> 31:50.826
More target practice.

31:51.259 --> 31:53.259
I say it's time we kick
some undead ass.

31:55.325 --> 31:56.790
[beeping]

31:56.792 --> 31:57.792
[Walker] Are we close?

31:58.792 --> 31:59.992
The signal seems to be
coming from over there.

32:00.892 --> 32:02.693
- You think or know?
- Yes. Yes, it is.

32:03.825 --> 32:04.857
Good.

32:04.859 --> 32:08.292
[beeping]

32:11.093 --> 32:12.259
[Chen] Okay.

32:13.093 --> 32:14.092
[Walker] Get in.

32:17.725 --> 32:18.725
Go.

32:20.925 --> 32:22.027
Go, go, go.

32:24.493 --> 32:25.693
[woman] Sir?

32:25.891 --> 32:27.192
[Chris] Hey, buddy.

32:33.726 --> 32:34.725
[gunshot]

32:41.058 --> 32:43.059
He was the doctor
we were searching for.

32:45.225 --> 32:46.925
So now what?

32:51.093 --> 32:52.093
[Tara] Walker?

32:54.725 --> 32:56.060
Weapons down. Don't shoot.

32:59.858 --> 33:02.291
To say I'm glad to see you
would be an understatement.

33:02.293 --> 33:03.293
Hi, Kyle.

33:04.325 --> 33:05.892
Hey, Tara.
Thank God you're alive.

33:06.725 --> 33:08.292
- Anyone else?
- No.

33:10.058 --> 33:12.026
We have to get this data
back to my father.

33:12.726 --> 33:14.924
- What is it?
- Complete DNA sequencing

33:14.926 --> 33:16.059
for Asclepius.

33:16.925 --> 33:18.092
Ass-what?

33:18.758 --> 33:21.060
Cyglobe named their cancer cure
after Asclepius,

33:21.359 --> 33:22.760
the Greek god of healing.

33:23.359 --> 33:25.093
He also had the power
to raise the dead.

33:26.093 --> 33:27.093
He did that, for sure.

33:27.858 --> 33:29.192
[Martinov] So is it
the cure?

33:29.891 --> 33:31.857
It's a start.
It should show us

33:31.859 --> 33:33.826
how all this began.
How it mutated.

33:35.059 --> 33:36.759
So what about we get you
out of here?

33:38.193 --> 33:39.193
You'll need this.

33:40.759 --> 33:41.760
How about that?

33:43.492 --> 33:45.059
[Walker] You know how to use it?

33:45.259 --> 33:47.027
Reluctantly, since I was seven.

33:47.226 --> 33:50.060
Having a general for a father
sometimes has its advantages.

33:50.992 --> 33:53.390
Chen, I want a short and safe
passage out of the building.

33:53.392 --> 33:54.359
[device beeps]

33:55.858 --> 33:57.259
There seems to be
an exit outta here.

33:57.992 --> 33:59.825
- Where?
- Let's see.

34:00.293 --> 34:01.293
Behind that wall.

34:06.292 --> 34:08.391
[growling]

34:08.393 --> 34:10.092
- Shit, it's here.
- What?

34:11.092 --> 34:13.156
- Subject zero.
- Subject what?

34:13.158 --> 34:14.792
[snarling]

34:25.891 --> 34:26.958
[guns cock]

34:31.158 --> 34:34.426
[gunshots]

34:47.391 --> 34:48.760
Chen, no. Come back!

34:50.192 --> 34:51.359
[zombie snarls]

34:54.126 --> 34:56.260
[grunts]

35:02.891 --> 35:04.059
Atkins, no!

35:11.391 --> 35:12.692
[screams]

35:13.858 --> 35:16.226
[gunshots]

35:17.058 --> 35:18.692
Martinov, the wall.

35:26.858 --> 35:28.126
Let's go, go, go.

35:28.425 --> 35:29.925
[groans]

35:30.392 --> 35:31.893
Get through.
Come on.

35:37.058 --> 35:38.489
Atkins, get back here.

35:38.491 --> 35:40.725
I can't.
My leg's broken.

35:41.092 --> 35:42.093
Go!

35:44.758 --> 35:46.425
Leave me.
I can't walk.

35:47.093 --> 35:49.227
Go! Go!

35:56.159 --> 35:57.326
Make it count.

35:58.059 --> 36:01.027
[subject zero snarling]

36:04.125 --> 36:05.759
Come and get it, baby.

36:07.826 --> 36:09.292
[explosion]

36:12.193 --> 36:13.823
[pants]

36:13.825 --> 36:14.826
Samantha?

36:15.192 --> 36:16.226
She's gone.

36:17.358 --> 36:18.956
Move it up, soldier.

36:18.958 --> 36:20.156
- Samantha!
- Move it up!

36:20.158 --> 36:22.093
Captain Walker, this way!

36:22.492 --> 36:24.190
Jefferson, get back here!

36:24.192 --> 36:25.824
[groans]

36:25.826 --> 36:27.489
[moaning]

36:27.491 --> 36:31.358
[gunshots]

36:35.225 --> 36:39.259
[insects chirping]

36:50.491 --> 36:52.023
[Tara] Are you okay?

36:52.025 --> 36:53.392
[Walker] What was that thing
back there?

36:54.357 --> 36:57.157
[Tara] The first human
experiment with the mutant DNA.

36:57.159 --> 36:59.457
They got their cancer cure
but it came at a price.

36:59.459 --> 37:00.789
[Walker] Were you involved?

37:00.791 --> 37:02.423
[Tara] This was strictly
Cyglobe.

37:02.425 --> 37:04.490
[Walker] Man playing God
creates monsters.

37:04.492 --> 37:07.060
- What's new?
- [Tara] Not man. Cyglobe.

37:08.357 --> 37:09.759
We need cover.

37:09.992 --> 37:11.726
Over there.
Let's go.

37:16.258 --> 37:20.258
[rock music playing]

37:21.092 --> 37:24.092
[snarls]

37:26.825 --> 37:29.358
I don't wanna get
lap dance with this girl.

37:31.825 --> 37:32.826
[gunshot]

37:35.025 --> 37:36.227
[gun clicks]

37:59.391 --> 38:00.693
[beeps]

38:11.392 --> 38:14.093
[beeping]

38:14.492 --> 38:17.057
Command, this is Walker.
Command, do you read me?

38:17.059 --> 38:18.093
Come in.

38:19.225 --> 38:20.959
[Conlan] <i>Come in, Walker.
Report your status.</i>

38:21.926 --> 38:23.992
Found the missing team.
All was killed.

38:24.491 --> 38:25.793
[Conlan] <i>Tara?</i>

38:26.258 --> 38:28.092
She's alive.
The only survivor.

38:30.826 --> 38:31.960
Thank God.

38:32.958 --> 38:35.425
Thank you, Walker.
Get her out safely.

38:36.891 --> 38:38.490
Get our coordinates
and send a chopper.

38:38.492 --> 38:39.826
Negative.

38:40.224 --> 38:42.157
Proceed to plan B
for departure.

38:42.159 --> 38:43.856
[Walker] <i>Get us
out of here now, General</i>

38:43.858 --> 38:45.226
Negative.
It's a no-go.

38:45.858 --> 38:47.923
Cannot explain now.
Proceed to Plan B.

38:47.925 --> 38:50.026
- That's an order.
- [Walker] <i>Copy that.</i>

38:50.891 --> 38:53.059
- And Walker?
- [Walker] <i>Yes, sir?</i>

38:55.092 --> 38:56.692
Take care of my daughter.

38:56.992 --> 38:58.693
Get her home safe, please.

38:58.959 --> 39:01.259
[Walker] <i>Copy that, sir.
I'll do my best.</i>

39:01.491 --> 39:02.759
<i>Walker out.</i>

39:02.991 --> 39:04.027
[beeps]

39:05.358 --> 39:06.359
See?

39:06.826 --> 39:08.326
That wasn't so hard, was it?

39:09.092 --> 39:11.390
This will end badly
for you, Russo.

39:11.392 --> 39:13.027
Oh, highly unlikely.

39:13.792 --> 39:15.223
If you harm
my daughter, I...

39:15.225 --> 39:17.226
You'll what? Hmm?

39:17.926 --> 39:19.824
It's very touching,
you playing

39:19.826 --> 39:21.490
the sentimental father,
considering you've been

39:21.492 --> 39:23.693
taking my handouts for years.

39:24.459 --> 39:26.093
You won't get away with this.

39:27.092 --> 39:29.325
Oh, I'll get away
with anything I want.

39:30.291 --> 39:31.660
I always do.

39:36.726 --> 39:37.826
[gunshot]

40:00.092 --> 40:01.125
Any bites?

40:16.992 --> 40:19.092
[Tara] What'd they say?
When will they fly us out?

40:19.391 --> 40:21.158
[sighs, clears throat]

40:22.192 --> 40:24.060
They won't be sending a chopper.

40:25.058 --> 40:26.091
What?

40:27.091 --> 40:28.326
That's crazy.

40:28.891 --> 40:30.358
Soldier, get a grip.

40:30.925 --> 40:32.956
We'll proceed
to perimeter location.

40:32.958 --> 40:34.191
Remember your briefing.

40:35.357 --> 40:37.792
Yeah. Plan B.

40:38.091 --> 40:39.425
[Walker]
That's what we're doing.

40:41.992 --> 40:43.926
Why would my father do that?

40:46.058 --> 40:47.292
I have no idea.

41:00.225 --> 41:01.325
You see that?

41:08.492 --> 41:09.860
Is that back up?

41:11.826 --> 41:13.426
That's not close
to the perimeter.

41:17.791 --> 41:18.926
Survivors?

41:22.958 --> 41:24.326
What do you think, Lieutenant?

41:27.792 --> 41:29.692
[Martinov] Yes,
it could be survivors.

41:31.091 --> 41:33.292
We stand a better chance,
the more we are.

41:36.225 --> 41:37.259
Agreed.

41:39.492 --> 41:41.825
[Chris] That's a lot of ground
to cover before dawn.

42:09.958 --> 42:12.158
Spread out.
Look for ammo. Anything useful.

42:12.959 --> 42:13.991
Northon.

42:20.257 --> 42:21.490
Captain, look out!

42:21.492 --> 42:23.091
[Walker] Hold your fire.

42:23.392 --> 42:24.826
Hold your fire.

42:26.092 --> 42:27.793
They aren't going anywhere.

42:29.025 --> 42:30.490
[Chris] Who would do that?

42:30.492 --> 42:33.291
[Tara] Must be somebody's sick
idea to keep them like this.

42:33.759 --> 42:34.859
It's torture.

42:35.358 --> 42:37.191
[woman] This is our place.

42:38.491 --> 42:40.958
You are trespassing. Go.

42:41.191 --> 42:42.856
Wait. Wait.

42:42.858 --> 42:43.958
I know you.

42:45.024 --> 42:46.358
They call them The Twins.
They're zombie hunters.

42:46.891 --> 42:48.925
Twins? They don't
look like twins to me.

42:49.458 --> 42:51.355
It's their nicknames.
These girls are legends

42:51.357 --> 42:52.825
in Terminal City.

42:53.025 --> 42:55.026
They probably killed
more zombies than you have.

42:55.358 --> 42:57.092
[Nika] Not just zombies.

42:57.358 --> 43:00.359
You have 10 seconds
to go out the way you came.

43:00.925 --> 43:02.159
Or what?

43:02.791 --> 43:04.092
You're seriously outgunned.

43:05.058 --> 43:06.226
You sure about that?

43:07.391 --> 43:09.123
If you like
killing zombies so much,

43:09.125 --> 43:10.892
then help us
get off this island.

43:14.058 --> 43:15.259
Or you can die right here.

43:37.024 --> 43:38.292
[growls]

43:40.391 --> 43:42.826
[gunshots]

43:44.991 --> 43:47.226
Seems like my new job
is saving your life.

43:47.759 --> 43:49.358
I can take care of myself.

43:50.191 --> 43:52.225
Oh, so you do like me?

44:02.857 --> 44:06.891
[birds chirping]

44:26.024 --> 44:28.055
Contagion Special Unit.

44:28.057 --> 44:29.259
You sent up a flare.

44:29.492 --> 44:30.793
Open up!

44:36.025 --> 44:37.359
Come in. Quickly.

44:37.958 --> 44:39.092
Quickly.

44:39.891 --> 44:41.026
Quick. Quick.

44:42.726 --> 44:44.159
Come, come, come. Quickly.

44:48.758 --> 44:51.392
[panting]

44:54.225 --> 44:56.422
Welcome to
the Church of New Hope.

44:56.424 --> 44:58.025
I'm Father Julian.

44:58.492 --> 45:00.925
Please, lower your weapons.

45:01.192 --> 45:02.958
This is sacred place.

45:04.492 --> 45:07.090
I'm sorry, <i>Padre,</i>
damn mutants don't care

45:07.092 --> 45:08.692
if this is a church.

45:10.225 --> 45:12.125
I need to get these people out.

45:12.858 --> 45:14.025
Can you help us?

45:20.324 --> 45:22.191
[sighs] Really wish I could.

45:23.092 --> 45:25.924
Well, I have a truck
in the back,

45:26.459 --> 45:29.959
but just no way of protecting
ourselves out there.

45:34.257 --> 45:37.355
- Please.
- This is my wife, Loretta.

45:37.357 --> 45:39.091
You got to help us
out of here.

45:41.424 --> 45:43.955
I'll tell you what,
you let me use the vehicle

45:43.957 --> 45:45.692
and we'll come back
and get you.

45:46.824 --> 45:48.791
- Okay
- Thank you.

45:51.459 --> 45:52.726
Sure.

46:00.392 --> 46:01.825
What are you looking for?

46:02.790 --> 46:04.158
Quickest way out here.

46:05.257 --> 46:06.956
Maybe those twins can help.

46:06.958 --> 46:08.660
Conlan's daughter
seemed to think so.

46:09.726 --> 46:10.792
Maybe.

46:16.957 --> 46:18.425
I'll go for the truck.

46:22.091 --> 46:24.759
You just make sure everyone else
is ready to move out.

46:28.058 --> 46:29.192
Copy that.

46:37.091 --> 46:38.258
[gun cocks]

46:41.391 --> 46:43.190
Northon, you're gonna
back me up.

46:43.192 --> 46:45.326
- Can you handle that?
- Yes, Captain.

46:46.091 --> 46:47.991
Martinov, you're in charge.

46:52.092 --> 46:53.226
Walker...

46:56.857 --> 46:58.059
be careful.

47:00.091 --> 47:01.691
I'll pull up in front.

47:02.091 --> 47:03.259
Be ready to move.

47:12.125 --> 47:13.660
You think it will start?

47:13.990 --> 47:15.158
Let's find out.

47:24.758 --> 47:26.059
[sighs]

47:28.357 --> 47:30.691
[engine turning over]

47:31.258 --> 47:32.859
Excuse me, Captain.

47:33.491 --> 47:35.659
What was it like being a cop
in Terminal City?

47:37.458 --> 47:39.959
What was this place like
before the outbreak?

47:41.157 --> 47:42.691
[sighs]

47:44.158 --> 47:45.692
Just get in there.

47:51.724 --> 47:52.825
[car door closes]

47:57.092 --> 47:58.925
[growling]

47:59.357 --> 48:00.358
You hear that?

48:02.491 --> 48:03.788
Try it.

48:03.790 --> 48:06.958
[engine turning over]

48:08.224 --> 48:09.791
I think they're gonna make it.

48:10.257 --> 48:11.824
[Martinov]
Move away from the door.

48:12.725 --> 48:14.692
Move away.
Here.

48:16.958 --> 48:18.092
Lower your weapons.

48:19.358 --> 48:20.659
Nice.

48:20.958 --> 48:23.891
Nice and easy.
Nice and easy.

48:28.224 --> 48:29.359
This one.

48:37.491 --> 48:39.958
Nice, nice, nice.

48:40.824 --> 48:43.025
You, come here.

48:51.225 --> 48:52.792
I need something from you.

48:53.424 --> 48:57.192
The DNA sequence,
the antidote, yes.

49:04.225 --> 49:05.292
Good girl.

49:10.025 --> 49:11.426
You know what this is?

49:12.092 --> 49:14.889
This is my new life
on a paradise island

49:14.891 --> 49:17.792
with no infected scumbag
chewing at my ass,

49:18.392 --> 49:21.891
living like a king
with my kids.

49:22.825 --> 49:24.192
Please don't do this.

49:24.990 --> 49:26.723
You'll never get away with it.

49:26.725 --> 49:29.856
[engine turning over]

49:29.858 --> 49:30.759
Again.

49:31.257 --> 49:34.423
[engine turning over]

49:34.425 --> 49:36.158
Out of chaos...

49:37.391 --> 49:38.991
comes order.

49:40.491 --> 49:41.824
And Cyglobe...

49:42.791 --> 49:46.192
will bring order
back to the world...

49:49.891 --> 49:51.092
with my help.

49:51.324 --> 49:54.189
[engine turning over]

49:54.191 --> 49:55.489
Try it again.

49:55.491 --> 49:57.289
[car engine starts]

49:57.291 --> 49:58.292
All right.

50:04.224 --> 50:05.359
Pretty.

50:06.391 --> 50:08.858
Do you really think
Walker will let you live?

50:13.424 --> 50:16.325
Cap, we got company.

50:35.092 --> 50:36.259
Keep it running.

50:42.324 --> 50:43.225
[knocks]

51:00.990 --> 51:02.225
[groans]

51:02.457 --> 51:04.092
<i>Dasvidaniya,</i> Captain.

51:04.890 --> 51:07.125
[grunting]

51:10.358 --> 51:12.225
- [snarling]
- [gunshots]

51:16.458 --> 51:17.859
[gunshots]

51:18.423 --> 51:19.358
[groans]

51:24.957 --> 51:26.092
That's enough, Captain.

51:28.291 --> 51:31.358
[panting]

51:33.324 --> 51:34.824
If he moves, kill him.

51:37.392 --> 51:38.759
Sorry, Captain.

51:39.358 --> 51:40.725
Bad luck.

51:43.824 --> 51:45.091
Hey, what's the matter, kid?

51:45.724 --> 51:48.091
What, are you a tough guy now?

51:58.490 --> 52:00.058
[gun cocks]

52:23.192 --> 52:24.259
You okay?

52:25.423 --> 52:26.691
Yeah.

52:28.891 --> 52:30.026
Never better.

52:48.091 --> 52:51.258
LV420.
The prototype treatment.

52:52.158 --> 52:53.692
One dose left.

52:55.924 --> 52:57.924
All the more reason
to get us out of here.

52:58.957 --> 53:00.325
So then you were bit.

53:03.125 --> 53:04.226
[Walker] Yeah.

53:07.990 --> 53:09.324
Three months ago.

53:10.091 --> 53:11.723
I know about LV420.

53:11.725 --> 53:13.425
I've been administered it
many times.

53:15.024 --> 53:17.091
Then I don't need to elaborate.

53:22.092 --> 53:23.925
You know it's temporary, right?

53:26.491 --> 53:29.424
That's why we need to nail
what happened with Asclepius.

53:30.990 --> 53:33.658
I don't give a shit
about any DNA sequence.

53:45.857 --> 53:47.725
You will when you start turning.

53:48.490 --> 53:50.125
Oh, it could happen.

53:51.357 --> 53:53.358
If I can't do it,
you'll do it for me.

53:54.356 --> 53:55.858
Promise me that.

53:57.958 --> 53:58.959
I promise.

54:00.357 --> 54:01.992
And I expect the same of you.

54:02.958 --> 54:03.992
Absolutely.

54:12.025 --> 54:14.392
How long has Cyglobe
been slipping your paycheck?

54:15.057 --> 54:17.025
You need to open
your eyes, Walker.

54:17.858 --> 54:20.222
Once this disease is cured,

54:20.224 --> 54:23.358
everyone will have to do
business with Cyglobe.

54:24.724 --> 54:25.591
Even you.

54:26.356 --> 54:29.788
By the way,
that's why no helicopter came.

54:29.790 --> 54:32.324
I was Cyglobe's
insurance policy.

54:32.957 --> 54:35.824
It was a lousy policy.
It didn't pay out.

54:37.490 --> 54:39.488
If they don't get
message from me,

54:39.490 --> 54:41.823
they will send more mercenaries.

54:41.825 --> 54:43.424
Either way, you're all dead.

54:44.324 --> 54:46.258
- Stay with me now.
- Okay.

54:48.125 --> 54:50.392
They are growing in numbers.

54:53.791 --> 54:55.358
They're pure evil.

54:56.124 --> 54:58.755
It's a DNA mutation
controlling their bodies

54:58.757 --> 54:59.959
they're not evil.

55:00.724 --> 55:03.991
You just look in their eyes.
You see demon.

55:04.224 --> 55:07.358
Each and every one of them
possessed.

55:08.024 --> 55:09.190
Sorry, <i>Padre.</i>

55:09.458 --> 55:10.992
They were created by men.

55:11.224 --> 55:13.859
He says there's a cure,
is it true?

55:16.257 --> 55:18.155
Well, we found a DNA sequence

55:18.157 --> 55:20.422
that should help us
create a cure.

55:20.424 --> 55:22.224
That's what we have
to bring back.

55:22.824 --> 55:24.224
Take us with you now.

55:25.857 --> 55:27.355
Look, I wish I could.

55:27.357 --> 55:30.856
[Martinov] Father Julian,
in here we are done for.

55:30.858 --> 55:32.955
We have to get out.

55:32.957 --> 55:35.022
Make it for the perimeter.

55:35.024 --> 55:36.955
And deliver the cure.

55:36.957 --> 55:38.891
Shut him up,
get him out of here now.

55:47.790 --> 55:49.091
I'll be back, I promise.

55:49.290 --> 55:51.091
Thank you.
God bless you.

55:52.424 --> 55:53.691
<i>Padre.</i>

55:53.958 --> 55:55.125
Can you shoot?

55:56.057 --> 55:59.091
I used to be against
all things violent,

55:59.356 --> 56:00.991
but not anymore.

56:02.091 --> 56:05.058
How did you think I have
survived here all this time?

56:06.224 --> 56:07.991
I was meaning to ask that.

56:11.024 --> 56:13.091
The power of the Lord,

56:14.257 --> 56:16.925
and the might of the sword...

56:19.758 --> 56:23.692
take vengeance
against all adversaries

56:24.423 --> 56:26.321
and rise up victorious

56:26.323 --> 56:29.125
against all demon warriors.

56:30.758 --> 56:33.224
Isaiah 27.

56:36.458 --> 56:38.158
Whatever you say, <i>Padre.</i>

56:44.224 --> 56:46.091
I never thought
I'd be in combat.

56:46.858 --> 56:48.788
My father wanted me
to join the military,

56:48.790 --> 56:51.088
but I always wanted
to be a scientist.

56:51.090 --> 56:52.225
[gun cocks]

56:53.024 --> 56:54.725
Combat's not for everyone.

56:55.224 --> 56:57.758
[sighs] Well,
at least I know how to shoot.

56:58.824 --> 57:00.824
It's not enough
knowing how to kill.

57:01.790 --> 57:03.058
You have to enjoy it.

57:03.958 --> 57:04.959
Do you?

57:08.191 --> 57:10.825
We're gonna head to a crossing
on Obama Bridge.

57:13.457 --> 57:15.025
If we can make it there...

57:16.224 --> 57:17.825
your father will get us out.

57:18.257 --> 57:21.692
Captain, do we have to fight
our way out of here?

57:23.958 --> 57:25.158
That's correct, soldier.

57:29.891 --> 57:30.959
[sighs]

57:39.323 --> 57:42.190
[growling]

57:49.423 --> 57:51.824
[gunshots]

57:56.224 --> 57:57.325
[moaning]

57:59.357 --> 58:01.291
[gunshots]

58:01.891 --> 58:03.325
[grunts] Let's go!

58:17.491 --> 58:21.759
[gunshots]

58:31.724 --> 58:34.290
I fancy a bottle
of that Irish whiskey.

58:34.891 --> 58:37.692
I have been too long with that.

58:51.091 --> 58:52.692
This is our home.

58:53.957 --> 58:55.791
This is God's home.

58:56.824 --> 59:00.791
And I intend to protect it
till I can no more.

59:01.757 --> 59:02.758
Hmm.

59:04.491 --> 59:08.692
Now, it says in the Bible
that the dead will rise.

59:08.990 --> 59:12.925
[muffled talking]

59:19.891 --> 59:21.988
This is my purpose in life.

59:21.990 --> 59:24.258
And I thought it was yours, too.

59:24.491 --> 59:28.822
[muffled talking]

59:28.824 --> 59:31.825
I'm sorry, I do not know
what you're saying.

59:32.023 --> 59:36.691
[muffled talking]

59:39.824 --> 59:41.990
Now, I have no judgment of you.

59:43.757 --> 59:45.391
Only dislike.

59:55.190 --> 59:56.724
[Martinov]
You are right, Father,

59:57.357 --> 59:58.358
you are right.

59:59.923 --> 01:00:02.355
We are sitting
in a trap in here.

01:00:02.357 --> 01:00:05.823
It's only a matter of time
until they get in

01:00:05.825 --> 01:00:09.225
and massacre us all.

01:00:11.290 --> 01:00:12.421
Your people.

01:00:12.423 --> 01:00:13.958
They should have a chance,

01:00:14.191 --> 01:00:16.225
they should have
a chance to live.

01:00:18.356 --> 01:00:20.455
Now, if you don't stop
I'm gonna have

01:00:20.457 --> 01:00:23.224
to put that gag back on you.

01:00:24.357 --> 01:00:27.358
You're right, Father,
you're right.

01:00:27.858 --> 01:00:29.725
Help yourself, Father,

01:00:30.257 --> 01:00:32.224
and help your congregation.

01:00:33.956 --> 01:00:38.391
They're the ones priority
in here, not us.

01:00:39.056 --> 01:00:41.021
Now, why are you telling me
all this?

01:00:41.023 --> 01:00:42.658
Because I wanna help you.

01:00:43.356 --> 01:00:46.190
I wanna help.
I agree with you.

01:00:46.491 --> 01:00:47.858
Just help me.

01:00:48.491 --> 01:00:49.725
Please?

01:00:50.924 --> 01:00:53.659
Father, help yourself

01:00:54.090 --> 01:00:56.089
and help your congregation.

01:00:56.091 --> 01:00:59.191
They're the one,
the top priority, not us.

01:00:59.890 --> 01:01:02.125
And why, pray tell,
should I trust you?

01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:05.225
Because I'm the only one

01:01:05.889 --> 01:01:09.958
who can get you out
of Terminal City.

01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:20.455
[sighs]
Father, I'm just trying to help.

01:01:20.457 --> 01:01:22.091
I don't know how to...

01:01:31.491 --> 01:01:32.891
Thank you.

01:01:35.491 --> 01:01:37.324
This is my missionary,

01:01:38.191 --> 01:01:39.824
and nobody said...

01:01:41.323 --> 01:01:42.854
it was going to be easy.

01:01:42.856 --> 01:01:44.024
You're right.

01:02:02.223 --> 01:02:03.391
[gun cocks]

01:02:12.157 --> 01:02:14.392
Amen, <i>Padre.</i>

01:02:17.458 --> 01:02:18.357
[gunshot]

01:02:20.725 --> 01:02:22.489
[Russo] <i>Colonel,
I'm authorizing an airstrike.</i>

01:02:22.491 --> 01:02:24.489
- [colonel] <i>Where?</i>
- [Russo] <i>Terminal City.</i>

01:02:24.491 --> 01:02:27.189
I want the entire city wiped off
the face of the earth.

01:02:27.191 --> 01:02:28.755
[colonel] <i>Ma'am,
we got people in there.</i>

01:02:28.757 --> 01:02:30.421
Yeah, I don't give a shit
about your problems.

01:02:30.423 --> 01:02:33.155
If we don't stop this now,
we're gonna lose the war.

01:02:33.157 --> 01:02:35.322
[colonel] <i>Like I said,
we have men in there.</i>

01:02:35.324 --> 01:02:37.322
They are my men,
let's get that clear,

01:02:37.324 --> 01:02:39.354
because you work for me.

01:02:39.356 --> 01:02:40.854
Or have you forgotten that?

01:02:40.856 --> 01:02:41.987
[colonel] <i>No, ma'am.</i>

01:02:41.989 --> 01:02:43.421
<i>Are you going
on record with this?</i>

01:02:43.423 --> 01:02:44.890
You bet your ass.

01:02:45.390 --> 01:02:47.824
- Execute.
- [colonel] <i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

01:03:02.491 --> 01:03:04.255
What happened to the world?

01:03:04.257 --> 01:03:06.222
Nature can be surprising.

01:03:06.224 --> 01:03:08.987
Death was taken away from us,
our right to die.

01:03:08.989 --> 01:03:10.823
Is there anything
human left behind?

01:03:11.957 --> 01:03:14.189
Well, somewhere in here
is human consciousness

01:03:14.191 --> 01:03:15.821
flowing through billions
of neurons,

01:03:15.823 --> 01:03:18.754
but zombie consciousness
only has enough brain activity

01:03:18.756 --> 01:03:20.255
for bodily functions.

01:03:20.257 --> 01:03:21.824
What happens to the person?

01:03:22.324 --> 01:03:25.791
I don't know, something like
being in a deep coma, maybe?

01:03:27.724 --> 01:03:30.024
And the more we kill,
the more we set free.

01:03:31.823 --> 01:03:33.923
Something like that, yeah.

01:03:38.957 --> 01:03:42.091
Captain Walker, how much further
to Obama Bridge?

01:03:43.223 --> 01:03:44.723
Three clicks.

01:03:46.157 --> 01:03:47.257
We made it.

01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:48.390
Not yet.

01:03:49.156 --> 01:03:51.823
You heard him,
three more kilometers to go.

01:03:53.090 --> 01:03:54.822
How much longer
are you gonna keep up

01:03:54.824 --> 01:03:56.355
this lone wolf act?

01:03:56.357 --> 01:03:59.891
For at least
three more kilometers?

01:04:01.124 --> 01:04:03.824
So when we get there,
drinks are on you this time?

01:04:05.091 --> 01:04:06.358
[laughs]

01:04:07.890 --> 01:04:10.923
[whispering]

01:04:15.191 --> 01:04:17.258
[car engine dies]

01:04:24.824 --> 01:04:26.891
[Walker] Goddammit.
[sighs]

01:04:32.956 --> 01:04:35.224
[Tara] <i>Padre</i> only left us
with eighth of a tank?

01:04:36.290 --> 01:04:38.124
[Walker] All right.
Get your gear ready.

01:04:38.823 --> 01:04:40.424
We're gonna walk from here.

01:04:44.490 --> 01:04:46.124
[sighs]
Let's go.

01:04:48.124 --> 01:04:49.658
Tara, up here.

01:04:53.090 --> 01:04:54.690
Marchetti, behind me.

01:04:56.090 --> 01:04:57.690
Behind me, thank you.

01:05:18.756 --> 01:05:20.257
Stay in the line, please.

01:05:36.224 --> 01:05:37.358
Now we're even.

01:05:38.023 --> 01:05:40.855
- Watch out!
- [growling]

01:05:40.857 --> 01:05:42.025
- Fire!
- [gunshots]

01:05:48.124 --> 01:05:49.354
Behind you, Captain!

01:05:49.356 --> 01:05:50.923
[gunshots]

01:06:01.823 --> 01:06:03.823
[Walker] Fall back, fall back!
Fall back.

01:06:07.023 --> 01:06:08.887
- We got to help them.
- Made a promise,

01:06:08.889 --> 01:06:10.690
I intend to keep it.
Now, let's go!

01:06:14.723 --> 01:06:15.791
Let's go!

01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:27.088
[Tara pants]
We can't just leave them.

01:06:27.090 --> 01:06:28.722
[Marchetti]
You heard what the captain said.

01:06:28.724 --> 01:06:30.854
Okay, ladies. Take five,
inside the building.

01:06:30.856 --> 01:06:32.090
I'll be right back.

01:07:36.090 --> 01:07:37.091
[sighs]

01:07:38.190 --> 01:07:39.190
[sighs]

01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:43.291
So, what are you gonna do
with the cure when we get out?

01:07:43.756 --> 01:07:44.824
[sighs]

01:07:45.824 --> 01:07:47.788
Well, technically
I still work for Cyglobe,

01:07:47.790 --> 01:07:49.691
but after today, that changes.

01:07:50.789 --> 01:07:51.858
What do you mean?

01:07:52.889 --> 01:07:54.455
My father never
would've left us in here

01:07:54.457 --> 01:07:56.188
without a damn good reason.

01:07:56.190 --> 01:07:59.690
Think about it, Cyglobe
doesn't want this war to end.

01:08:00.223 --> 01:08:01.823
War is expensive.

01:08:03.156 --> 01:08:04.423
And they sell all these guns.

01:08:05.356 --> 01:08:08.357
Exactly. I think
they somehow got to my father.

01:08:09.291 --> 01:08:11.024
Stopped him
from trying to help us.

01:08:16.357 --> 01:08:19.823
Command, this is Walker,
come in, command, over.

01:08:22.823 --> 01:08:25.290
Command, this is Walker,
come in, command, over.

01:08:30.856 --> 01:08:31.957
Shit.

01:08:44.823 --> 01:08:45.957
Don't move.

01:08:49.788 --> 01:08:51.024
We just want the stick.

01:08:52.057 --> 01:08:54.821
- Asclepius.
- I don't have it.

01:08:54.823 --> 01:08:56.024
I gave it to Walker.

01:08:56.889 --> 01:08:59.024
Okay. Kill her.

01:09:00.090 --> 01:09:01.090
[groans]

01:09:04.823 --> 01:09:06.423
One last chance,

01:09:07.024 --> 01:09:08.390
you don't have to die.

01:09:08.956 --> 01:09:10.658
At least not by us.

01:09:12.924 --> 01:09:14.058
[Walker] No can do.

01:09:27.023 --> 01:09:28.658
They work for Cyglobe.

01:09:36.322 --> 01:09:37.756
[Chris] Stay close.

01:09:38.223 --> 01:09:39.858
Don't worry, we'll find them.

01:09:41.490 --> 01:09:42.791
You okay?

01:09:43.724 --> 01:09:45.823
Did anyone ever tell you
you talk too much?

01:09:46.923 --> 01:09:49.390
[Naomi] My parents. Before.

01:09:49.823 --> 01:09:51.921
And my little sister
used to make fun of me

01:09:51.923 --> 01:09:53.691
for always telling stories.

01:09:54.389 --> 01:09:56.888
- What stories?
- All kinds.

01:09:56.890 --> 01:09:58.724
I used to pretend that...

01:09:59.223 --> 01:10:00.888
That I was
Alice in Wonderland.

01:10:00.890 --> 01:10:03.791
I would imagine going down the
rabbit's hole.

01:10:04.323 --> 01:10:05.357
Well...

01:10:08.323 --> 01:10:11.225
I close my eyes and tell them
everything I could see.

01:10:11.889 --> 01:10:12.958
Yeah?

01:10:14.123 --> 01:10:17.124
But things changed after...

01:10:18.355 --> 01:10:19.723
You miss them?

01:10:22.124 --> 01:10:23.058
I do.

01:10:26.423 --> 01:10:27.758
[sighs]

01:10:27.957 --> 01:10:29.691
Things are gonna change
after this.

01:10:30.923 --> 01:10:33.090
What? Do you think
they're gonna give us medals?

01:10:34.090 --> 01:10:36.890
I'd settle for Hawaii.
Coming with?

01:10:37.924 --> 01:10:39.191
So, that's your move?

01:10:41.256 --> 01:10:42.357
Maybe.

01:10:45.223 --> 01:10:46.722
[screams]

01:10:46.724 --> 01:10:47.824
No!

01:10:48.191 --> 01:10:50.257
No, get out!

01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:52.921
- It's too late!
- You can make it!

01:10:52.923 --> 01:10:53.957
It's too late!

01:10:54.190 --> 01:10:55.190
I'm not leaving you!

01:10:55.389 --> 01:10:57.390
This is for my family.
[grunts]

01:10:58.191 --> 01:10:59.357
[explosion]

01:11:14.824 --> 01:11:16.224
[Tara] You know Walker before?

01:11:16.457 --> 01:11:18.721
- [Marchetti] Before CSU?
- [Tara] Mm.

01:11:18.723 --> 01:11:19.890
[Marchetti] No.

01:11:20.124 --> 01:11:21.924
[Tara] He ever talk
about his family?

01:11:22.356 --> 01:11:26.221
He used to. I remember one day
after a mission

01:11:26.223 --> 01:11:27.954
he, kind of, opened up about it.

01:11:27.956 --> 01:11:30.221
He, uh, came home after work,

01:11:30.223 --> 01:11:32.155
found his wife and daughter
had turned

01:11:32.157 --> 01:11:34.290
and, uh, they attacked him.

01:11:35.223 --> 01:11:38.122
And, uh, he had to shoot them,
he didn't have a choice.

01:11:38.124 --> 01:11:39.658
Right there in the kitchen.

01:11:40.091 --> 01:11:41.958
- It's awful.
- Yeah.

01:11:43.056 --> 01:11:44.855
Worse part about it
is there are probably

01:11:44.857 --> 01:11:46.891
thousands of stories out there
just like it.

01:11:58.889 --> 01:12:00.923
Command, this is Walker,
do you read me? Over.

01:12:03.190 --> 01:12:05.923
Command, this Walker,
do you read me? Over.

01:12:11.255 --> 01:12:12.190
Tara.

01:12:17.222 --> 01:12:19.790
Any idea why your father
would go silent on us?

01:12:20.356 --> 01:12:22.891
Like I said, it's got to be
Russo and Cyglobe.

01:12:26.490 --> 01:12:27.691
Marchetti.

01:12:31.789 --> 01:12:32.823
Marchetti?

01:12:53.856 --> 01:12:54.957
Wait here.

01:12:55.223 --> 01:12:56.357
Watch our six.

01:13:18.857 --> 01:13:19.924
Marchetti!

01:13:24.956 --> 01:13:26.157
Goddammit.

01:13:28.223 --> 01:13:31.791
[grunting]

01:13:41.423 --> 01:13:43.157
You must really hate me now.

01:13:43.989 --> 01:13:44.957
Yeah.

01:13:45.356 --> 01:13:48.323
[grunting]

01:14:35.956 --> 01:14:37.289
Don't fight it, Walker.

01:14:38.223 --> 01:14:39.256
Don't fight it.

01:14:39.823 --> 01:14:41.157
[groans]

01:14:48.824 --> 01:14:52.290
Soon, you will see your wife
and your kid.

01:14:56.889 --> 01:14:59.823
You never get over losing them.

01:15:02.456 --> 01:15:07.324
Especially you are the one
responsible for putting a bullet

01:15:08.422 --> 01:15:11.289
in each of their heads.

01:15:13.222 --> 01:15:14.691
[groans]

01:15:22.957 --> 01:15:23.990
Don't fight it.

01:15:24.723 --> 01:15:25.989
[grunts]

01:15:26.988 --> 01:15:28.923
[gunshots]

01:15:37.456 --> 01:15:40.288
Told you having a general
for a father has its advantages.

01:15:40.290 --> 01:15:41.657
[sighs]

01:15:41.989 --> 01:15:44.024
[panting]

01:15:45.189 --> 01:15:46.657
[coughs]

01:16:05.022 --> 01:16:06.356
Enough of this shit.

01:16:06.824 --> 01:16:09.758
[growling]

01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:29.224
[Martinov screams]

01:16:38.857 --> 01:16:41.153
[Walker panting]

01:16:41.155 --> 01:16:42.356
LV420?

01:16:43.489 --> 01:16:44.990
That's the last of it.

01:16:46.222 --> 01:16:48.187
Look, I can get to work
on saving you

01:16:48.189 --> 01:16:49.824
as soon as you get us
out of here.

01:16:50.422 --> 01:16:52.423
There's nothing for me
beyond this city.

01:16:53.955 --> 01:16:55.823
Walker,
you didn't have a choice.

01:16:56.457 --> 01:16:57.890
They were my family.

01:16:58.190 --> 01:16:59.487
My responsibility.

01:16:59.489 --> 01:17:01.889
The outbreak caught us
all off guard.

01:17:02.089 --> 01:17:03.823
You can't blame yourself.

01:17:04.824 --> 01:17:06.290
Blame isn't my game.

01:17:06.823 --> 01:17:09.090
Well, regret
shouldn't be either.

01:17:09.489 --> 01:17:12.423
You've sacrificed enough.
More than most.

01:17:13.789 --> 01:17:15.823
I lost everything
when it started.

01:17:16.723 --> 01:17:19.357
My family, my city...

01:17:21.390 --> 01:17:22.423
my soul.

01:17:24.723 --> 01:17:27.123
It's up to you now to save
what's left of humanity.

01:17:27.889 --> 01:17:29.857
The part that still has
a fighting chance.

01:17:32.290 --> 01:17:35.090
- [sighs]
- [Walker] I belong here.

01:17:40.256 --> 01:17:41.690
[Chris] Walker!

01:17:43.989 --> 01:17:46.224
[panting]
Where's Marchetti?

01:17:48.323 --> 01:17:49.391
Naomi?

01:17:51.223 --> 01:17:52.224
Dead.

01:17:55.724 --> 01:17:56.823
Captain.

01:17:59.189 --> 01:18:01.257
[moaning]

01:18:01.757 --> 01:18:02.957
All right. Move out.

01:18:05.855 --> 01:18:07.189
Get a grip, soldier.

01:18:08.156 --> 01:18:09.157
Let's go.

01:18:23.022 --> 01:18:25.157
- Is that it?
- It's not far now.

01:18:26.856 --> 01:18:28.823
I was hoping
it wouldn't come to this.

01:18:30.122 --> 01:18:32.356
[Chris] What? A way out of here?

01:18:32.955 --> 01:18:34.658
[Walker] Ever heard
of the gauntlet?

01:18:35.223 --> 01:18:36.953
I have, of course.

01:18:36.955 --> 01:18:38.658
Somebody want to clue me in?

01:18:39.456 --> 01:18:42.954
The gauntlet is our last chance
to get out of Terminal City now.

01:18:42.956 --> 01:18:44.754
No. That's not a way out.

01:18:44.756 --> 01:18:46.089
Why did they call it that?

01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:49.020
When the outbreak started

01:18:49.022 --> 01:18:50.789
everyone tried to get out
that way.

01:18:51.390 --> 01:18:52.957
It was a bloodbath.

01:18:53.255 --> 01:18:55.755
More like a shooting gallery
for zombies.

01:18:55.757 --> 01:18:58.090
So we got zombies waiting for us
if we go this way?

01:19:00.090 --> 01:19:01.822
Our army made a stand.

01:19:03.123 --> 01:19:04.190
They lost.

01:19:05.023 --> 01:19:07.057
A lot of civilians
died there, too.

01:19:08.723 --> 01:19:10.290
Now
they're still hanging around,

01:19:10.755 --> 01:19:12.023
waiting for more victims.

01:19:12.823 --> 01:19:14.356
Anybody ever made it through?

01:19:15.122 --> 01:19:16.657
None that I know of.

01:19:17.756 --> 01:19:18.922

Who the hell are you guys?

01:21:45.222 --> 01:21:47.320
Captain Kyle Walker, CSU.

01:21:47.322 --> 01:21:48.987
General Conlan sent you?

01:21:48.989 --> 01:21:50.153
Negative.

01:21:50.155 --> 01:21:51.487
You guys were lucky,

01:21:51.489 --> 01:21:53.089
I'm the last
of a recon unit here.

01:21:53.989 --> 01:21:55.753
We lost contact with Conlan.

01:21:55.755 --> 01:21:57.020
Any word from him?

01:21:57.022 --> 01:21:58.220
No, sir.

01:21:58.222 --> 01:22:00.221
Captain, you were about
three seconds

01:22:00.223 --> 01:22:01.723
from being blown all to hell.

01:22:02.956 --> 01:22:04.357
So much for plan B.

01:22:05.490 --> 01:22:07.690
What kind of recon
were you doing out here?

01:22:08.023 --> 01:22:11.257
I was monitoring Terminal City
for any warm bodies.

01:22:11.490 --> 01:22:13.690
We were tracking a mission
a couple of days ago.

01:22:13.956 --> 01:22:15.024
They disappeared.

01:22:15.389 --> 01:22:17.120
We were sent in to get him.

01:22:17.122 --> 01:22:18.356
You weren't told about us?

01:22:18.789 --> 01:22:19.790
Negative.

01:22:20.855 --> 01:22:21.790
There are no new missions
scheduled for this area.

01:22:23.255 --> 01:22:24.190
We were set up.

01:22:25.056 --> 01:22:27.024
Cyglobe, Russo.

01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:29.856
Look, we can debate
about this shit later, okay?

01:22:31.223 --> 01:22:34.223
Right now,
we need to evac.

01:22:36.090 --> 01:22:37.823
All right. You heard him.
Load up.

01:22:43.056 --> 01:22:44.224
You're not coming?

01:22:45.356 --> 01:22:47.388
Made a promise to those people
at that church.

01:22:47.390 --> 01:22:48.689
I got to go get them out.

01:22:49.055 --> 01:22:50.820
This one's
the number one priority.

01:22:50.822 --> 01:22:53.221
She might be able to end
this damn war once and for all.

01:22:53.223 --> 01:22:54.323
Yes, sir.

01:23:01.889 --> 01:23:03.753
You know, I realized something.

01:23:03.755 --> 01:23:06.024
What's really left
of our humanity,

01:23:06.855 --> 01:23:07.956
it's us.

01:23:08.156 --> 01:23:09.823
The humans left to fight.

01:23:10.190 --> 01:23:14.357
Because despite everything,
we still care.

01:23:16.755 --> 01:23:18.488
Tara, I don't think
all of that's gonna fit

01:23:18.490 --> 01:23:19.957
on my tombstone.

01:23:25.723 --> 01:23:26.823
Walker!

01:23:36.855 --> 01:23:38.689
We need to go, now.

Coming.

All right, guys, we'll pick
this up tomorrow, okay?

01:24:25.489 --> 01:24:27.288
All right. Next time.

01:24:27.290 --> 01:24:29.387
<i>Oh, yeah. Thanks.
Thanks, Chris.</i>

01:24:29.389 --> 01:24:31.786
<i>You just ruined it
for everybody. Okay?</i>

01:24:31.788 --> 01:24:33.487
<i>All right. See you later, guys.
Good game.</i>

01:24:33.489 --> 01:24:35.721

me with Subject Zero.</i>

01:25:13.022 --> 01:25:15.224
