<i>Hi, I'm Chuck.</i> <i>Here are a few
things</i> <i>that you might need to know.</i>

00:03.836 --> 00:06.573
We spared no expense
recreating the Buy More.

00:06.640 --> 00:10.309
<i>It's now a full-fledged</i>
<i>CIA-NSA substation.</i>

00:10.377 --> 00:11.444
I'm pregnant.

00:11.445 --> 00:13.345
Oh, my God,
oh, my God.

00:13.381 --> 00:14.980
Alex, I'm your father.

00:14.981 --> 00:16.314
<i>If Volkoff has</i>

00:16.315 --> 00:17.548
any intel on my mom,

00:17.549 --> 00:18.616
<i>we need to try and find it.</i>

00:18.617 --> 00:20.517
Someone is looking
for you. Who?

00:20.585 --> 00:21.718
Your family.

00:21.719 --> 00:23.118
Have you told Volkoff anything?

00:23.119 --> 00:24.185
Told him nothing.

00:24.186 --> 00:26.086
That's good.

00:28.000 --> 00:34.074

01:04.150 --> 01:06.084
<i>Okay, we're a man down,</i>

01:06.152 --> 01:07.685
so you three really need
to step it up

01:07.686 --> 01:09.086
while Ellie's out of commission.

01:09.087 --> 01:10.987
Devon,
I'm 13 weeks pregnant.

01:10.989 --> 01:12.889
Exactly- we've
already lost 13 weeks,

01:12.891 --> 01:15.092
and there are a lot of decisions
that need to be made:

01:15.160 --> 01:16.994
natural or water birth,

01:16.995 --> 01:18.594
Ergo or BabyBj rn?

01:18.595 --> 01:21.163
Spanish or French
as a second language,

01:21.231 --> 01:23.432
or are we gonna blow it
wide open and go Japanese?

01:23.499 --> 01:25.266
Devon, the baby's not due
for another six months.

01:25.267 --> 01:27.101
You still have a
little lead time.

01:27.102 --> 01:29.637
Exactly, thank you,
a- and besides,

01:29.704 --> 01:31.972
tomorrow is Chuck's first day
back at Buy More.

01:32.040 --> 01:34.274
Oh, and, and Morgan's.

01:34.341 --> 01:35.475
Thank you.

01:35.476 --> 01:36.876
A little acknowledgement
goes a long way.

01:36.877 --> 01:38.811
You know, Ellie, it's not
that big a deal. Morgan and I,

01:38.878 --> 01:41.146
after all, have worked
for the Buy More before.

01:41.214 --> 01:44.148
Well, it's still exciting,
and it's safe.

01:44.216 --> 01:46.517
It's safe and exciting.

01:46.585 --> 01:47.951
You tired, babe, huh?

01:47.952 --> 01:49.386
I know you haven't
been sleeping well.

01:49.387 --> 01:51.288
Is the baby resting
on your spleen?

01:51.356 --> 01:52.789
Okay, Devon, seriously,
you have to relax.

01:52.790 --> 01:54.591
The baby is like
the size of a walnut.

01:54.592 --> 01:56.892
Hey, hey, watch
your tone.

01:56.960 --> 01:58.561
Eardrums develop
in week 12.

01:58.562 --> 02:00.729
Our little walnut can
hear everything you say.

02:00.797 --> 02:01.797
What is happening?

02:01.798 --> 02:03.431
I have no idea.

02:03.432 --> 02:04.999
Hey, you guys should be
taking some notes over here.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.900
You could be next.

02:07.502 --> 02:09.136
Well, I don't know,
Sarah would have

02:09.137 --> 02:10.470
to unpack first

02:10.471 --> 02:11.605
for them to even think
about...

02:11.606 --> 02:13.540
...starting a family.

02:19.046 --> 02:20.946
Snow pea?

02:24.818 --> 02:27.286
Do you think it's weird
I haven't unpacked yet?

02:27.353 --> 02:28.387
What?

02:28.388 --> 02:30.656
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, of course not.

02:30.724 --> 02:32.958
I mean, you know,
it's only been eight months.

02:33.026 --> 02:35.327
Right, and, uh, and I've
been on missions

02:35.395 --> 02:36.829
practically
the entire time

02:36.830 --> 02:38.597
and I have to go
away again soon.

02:38.598 --> 02:40.732
Totally, I get it, you
know that I get it.

02:40.800 --> 02:42.032
Look, don't
listen to Morgan.

02:42.033 --> 02:43.466
He doesn't know what
he's talking about.

02:43.467 --> 02:44.934
The guy eats cereal
with a fork.

02:44.935 --> 02:46.434
So you're okay with it?

02:46.435 --> 02:49.300
You're here.

02:49.368 --> 02:50.668
That's all that
matters to me.

02:50.669 --> 02:53.370
Okay?

02:53.437 --> 02:55.438
It's not weird at all.

02:55.506 --> 02:56.873
<i>It's totally weird, right?</i>

02:56.874 --> 02:57.940
<i>Of course it is.</i>

02:57.941 --> 02:59.875
I mean, she won't
put one thing

02:59.943 --> 03:02.210
in her side of the
closet, not a thing.

03:02.278 --> 03:03.712
It's like she'd
rather be on a mission

03:03.713 --> 03:05.513
than, than back
home with me.

03:05.514 --> 03:07.315
Well, it's just
when everything seems great

03:07.316 --> 03:08.349
and everything
seems perfect,

03:08.350 --> 03:09.850
that's usually
when you find it, man.

03:09.851 --> 03:11.652
Find, find, find what?

03:11.653 --> 03:12.653
The Achilles' heel.

03:12.654 --> 03:14.188
Chuck, every relationship
has one-

03:14.189 --> 03:16.022
the singular problem
that cannot be overcome

03:16.023 --> 03:17.290
even in the
greatest romances-

03:17.291 --> 03:21.093
Romeo and Juliet,
Tristan and Isolde,

03:21.161 --> 03:22.428
Anakin and Padmé.

03:22.429 --> 03:25.030
Are you saying then
that Sarah not unpacking

03:25.098 --> 03:26.465
is our Achilles' heel?

03:26.466 --> 03:27.466
Take my advice, buddy:

03:27.467 --> 03:29.300
keep your feelings
to yourself, okay?

03:29.301 --> 03:31.169
You don't want to give her
any more reason to bolt.

03:31.170 --> 03:33.504
BECKMAN Chuck Bartowski, please
report to the manager's office.

03:33.572 --> 03:34.572
Duty calls.

03:34.573 --> 03:35.606
Thanks for the
talk, buddy.

03:35.607 --> 03:37.607
Of course.

03:39.176 --> 03:40.510
Roger that.

03:40.511 --> 03:42.445
Gentlemen,
you're dismissed.

03:42.513 --> 03:45.247
How you guys doing?

03:47.884 --> 03:49.951
So, uh, I'm Agent Grimes.

03:50.986 --> 03:53.287
You're Special Ops.

03:53.355 --> 03:55.255
I know you guys are all
undercover spies, but

03:55.290 --> 03:56.356
I'm pretty familiar
with the old girl-

03:56.357 --> 03:57.557
Buy More, you know.

03:57.558 --> 03:58.992
If you have any questions,
feel free to ask.

03:58.993 --> 04:00.526
Take a little coffee break,
we'll just kind of go...

04:00.527 --> 04:03.829
We're working.
We don't take breaks.

04:03.897 --> 04:06.597
You're a very tiny man,
aren't you?

04:06.665 --> 04:07.665
Uh,

04:07.666 --> 04:09.300
have you looked
in a mirror lately?

04:09.301 --> 04:10.834
You're, um,

04:10.835 --> 04:13.269
just quite impressive,
to be honest with you.

04:13.337 --> 04:14.370
I mean, it's really just

04:14.371 --> 04:15.738
the physical
specimen.

04:15.739 --> 04:16.939
I used to be like
that, but- oh,

04:16.940 --> 04:18.141
just gonna pick that
up with one arm?

04:18.142 --> 04:19.142
You're just gonna
one-arm that thing?

04:19.142 --> 04:21.410
Okay, that's, uh...

04:21.478 --> 04:24.113
I used to do that myself, but
I just forgot my weight belt.

04:24.180 --> 04:26.881
One of our agents was killed
in Milan last night

04:26.949 --> 04:29.750
while he was tracking
this woman-

04:29.818 --> 04:31.952
Sofia Stepanova.

04:32.019 --> 04:33.586
Hi-yo.

04:33.587 --> 04:35.221
Who do we have taking
our surveillance pics?

04:35.222 --> 04:37.424
Because those
are tremendous.

04:37.491 --> 04:38.725
Can you see
the way...?

04:38.726 --> 04:40.693
What?
No, no, no, no.

04:40.761 --> 04:41.761
I'm just saying, clearly...

04:41.762 --> 04:42.928
Is she in a bathing suit?

04:42.929 --> 04:44.262
I didn't even notice that
the first time.

04:44.263 --> 04:46.064
We can all
acknowledge

04:46.065 --> 04:48.967
that Ms. Stepanova
is quite fetching.

04:49.034 --> 04:49.934
Hmm.

04:49.935 --> 04:50.902
But don't be fooled

04:50.903 --> 04:52.236
by her appearance.

04:52.237 --> 04:54.138
We believe
she's the executor of Volkoff's

04:54.206 --> 04:55.573
most important
weapons deals.

04:55.574 --> 04:59.276
She uses her cover as a runway
model to travel the world,

04:59.344 --> 05:02.345
get access
to the most powerful people,

05:02.413 --> 05:05.514
and deliver weapons like this.

05:05.582 --> 05:08.985
Stepanova stole an ammunition
clip containing smart bullets

05:09.052 --> 05:11.855
from a weapons development
facility outside Paris.

05:13.123 --> 05:14.757
Mr. Bartowski.

05:14.758 --> 05:15.791
Uh, what are
smart bullets?

05:15.792 --> 05:17.994
Microchip controlled. They have

05:18.061 --> 05:19.094
a built-in GPS.

05:19.095 --> 05:21.163
The bullet guides itself
to the target.

05:21.230 --> 05:22.731
Something a good spy

05:22.732 --> 05:23.732
would never need.

05:23.733 --> 05:25.133
Maybe you should get some.

05:25.134 --> 05:27.068
Actually, that's exactly
what I need you to do.

05:27.136 --> 05:29.371
Stepanova plans
to sell the weapons

05:29.438 --> 05:31.272
at a party
during Milan Fashion Week.

05:31.273 --> 05:33.507
I'm sending you two
to intercept them.

05:33.575 --> 05:36.176
Colonel Casey...

05:36.244 --> 05:38.411
after the Yves St. Laurent
incident,

05:38.479 --> 05:40.647
you will obviously have
to sit this one out.

05:40.714 --> 05:42.481
Stab one guy with a stiletto...

05:42.482 --> 05:44.382
Bartowski,
Walker,

05:44.383 --> 05:45.783
you'll need
to leave immediately.

05:45.784 --> 05:47.885
Packed and ready to go, General.

05:50.052 --> 05:53.821
Now, there's
a woman in love.

05:53.888 --> 05:55.890
No one loves a mission
more than Walker.

06:02.295 --> 06:05.063
You need to be
on your guard out there.

06:05.131 --> 06:06.631
Volkoff
and his people-

06:06.632 --> 06:08.133
they're serious.

06:08.134 --> 06:10.869
Yeah, yeah, I,
uh, I got it,

06:10.936 --> 06:13.237
but the closer I get
to finding Volkoff,

06:13.305 --> 06:15.439
the closer I get to finding
my mom. Well, I won't be there

06:15.507 --> 06:16.940
to rescue your ass.

06:16.941 --> 06:18.342
I'll be stuck here.

06:18.343 --> 06:19.642
"Stuck here."

06:19.643 --> 06:23.411
Come on, Casey, you know
you like Burbank a little.

06:23.478 --> 06:25.713
Okay, granted,

06:25.780 --> 06:27.014
we'd all rather be
on the Amalfi Coast

06:27.015 --> 06:28.215
or Bora-Bora or
something like that,

06:28.216 --> 06:29.916
but don't you feel a
little bit at home here?

06:29.917 --> 06:33.351
Yeah, I guess,
about as much as Darfur

06:33.419 --> 06:36.253
or that cave in Afghanistan.

06:37.488 --> 06:41.024
Okay, but then,
supposing there was someone-

06:41.092 --> 06:42.760
could there be someone,
a person-

06:42.761 --> 06:44.562
who makes you feel

06:44.563 --> 06:46.365
even a little more
at home, like Alex?

06:46.366 --> 06:48.368
I mean, you see
her a lot, right?

06:48.436 --> 06:50.270
No.

06:50.271 --> 06:52.105
No?
She's your daughter.

06:52.106 --> 06:53.840
Spies don't put down roots.

06:53.841 --> 06:56.075
That's the rule.

06:56.143 --> 06:57.142
Rule.

06:57.143 --> 06:58.377
It's not a rule.

06:58.378 --> 07:00.012
It's a, it's a notion
or a suggestion

07:00.013 --> 07:03.081
or guideline.

07:03.148 --> 07:05.049
It's about that Achilles'
heel thing, isn't it?

07:05.117 --> 07:07.218
Achilles- how do you know...?

07:07.285 --> 07:09.185
Grimes told me.

07:09.220 --> 07:11.120
That pipsqueak will talk to
anyone he thinks is listening.

07:12.056 --> 07:15.858
Chuck, beautiful women
have a lot of baggage.

07:15.926 --> 07:18.027
You should be happy
Walker's is just a suitcase.

07:18.028 --> 07:23.581
Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com

08:10.739 --> 08:12.339
Any sign of Sofia?
<i>New look. New Day. Who knew!</i>

08:12.340 --> 08:14.241
No, not yet.

08:14.309 --> 08:15.776
Strapless Versace, huh?

08:15.777 --> 08:17.477
Very daring, Agent Walker.

08:17.478 --> 08:19.745
How much <i>Project Runway</i>
have you been watching?

08:19.813 --> 08:22.581
♪ ♪

08:25.518 --> 08:27.285
There she is.

08:27.286 --> 08:29.354
It's got to be
in the purse.

08:29.421 --> 08:31.255
The smart bullets?

08:31.256 --> 08:33.590
All right, I got this one.

08:43.765 --> 08:44.799
Ya...

08:44.800 --> 08:45.800
Excuse me.

08:45.801 --> 08:47.335
Who do you
think you are?

08:47.336 --> 08:48.836
Nobody, I'm nobody,
this is nothing.

08:48.837 --> 08:50.171
No, I wasn't ting
to do that-

08:50.172 --> 08:53.274
put my hand
on your bottom.

08:53.341 --> 08:55.942
Your hand is still
touching my perfection.

08:56.010 --> 08:57.510
So it is.

08:57.511 --> 08:58.510
So sorry about that.

08:58.511 --> 08:59.644
That was
an accident-

08:59.645 --> 09:01.779
a happy accident, kind of,
I guess, not really-

09:01.847 --> 09:02.847
uh, but I'm not
a weirdo pervert

09:02.848 --> 09:04.749
by any stretch
of the imagination.

09:04.817 --> 09:06.184
Then what are you doing
here? I'm, I'm here

09:06.185 --> 09:08.218
with, um...

09:08.286 --> 09:10.252
Oh, I see.

09:10.320 --> 09:11.386
Oh.

09:11.387 --> 09:14.122
No harm done.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.959
Did you get it?
Not exactly, no.

09:20.961 --> 09:23.328
Had a little awkward
moment there, actually.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.696
What happened? I
went for the purse

09:24.697 --> 09:25.863
and then she
turned and then

09:25.864 --> 09:27.698
my hand was very-
I mean, very lightly

09:27.699 --> 09:29.599
on her-
kind of-

09:29.634 --> 09:30.834
you know, really it's
not that important.

09:30.835 --> 09:32.735
She's still at the bar.

09:35.839 --> 09:38.474
He's taking her purse.

09:38.541 --> 09:40.775
What, who is?
The bartender.

09:40.843 --> 09:42.743
She's already
made the drop.

09:49.851 --> 09:51.751
Hand it over.

09:59.526 --> 10:01.927

10:01.995 --> 10:04.796
Uh, Sarah.

10:04.864 --> 10:06.931
She knew we were coming.

10:06.999 --> 10:09.202

10:09.269 --> 10:11.504
Okay, remain calm-
remain ca- remai...

10:11.572 --> 10:13.772
Should I throw it?

10:15.107 --> 10:16.341
Why did it click?

10:16.342 --> 10:17.408
Clicks are bad.

10:17.409 --> 10:18.675
Okay, it must have
a pressure sensor.

10:18.676 --> 10:20.576
If you let go, it'll explode.

10:22.913 --> 10:25.380
Oh, go quick, quick,
quick, quick, quick.

10:25.447 --> 10:27.681
Do what you do.

10:28.583 --> 10:29.916
Sarah, listen,

10:29.917 --> 10:31.351
I cannot die
without you knowing

10:31.352 --> 10:33.220
that I accept you for
who you are, okay?

10:33.221 --> 10:35.222
Your weird unpacking habit-
it doesn't matter to me.

10:35.289 --> 10:37.189
Nothing matters.
I still love you.

10:45.296 --> 10:47.931
You <i>still</i> love me?

10:47.999 --> 10:49.899
Sorry, what, what?

10:49.900 --> 10:53.134
Did I...

10:53.202 --> 10:55.269
Those weren't the best
last words, were they?

11:00.807 --> 11:03.408
Top three things you
can do with a Roomba.

11:03.443 --> 11:05.944
Number three. Go

11:07.246 --> 11:09.447
Okay, this new Buy More
has changed a lot,

11:09.515 --> 11:11.615
and I don't think
it's for the better.

11:11.683 --> 11:13.684
Shut up, Grimes.

11:15.921 --> 11:17.855
Dude, what is up
with the Buy More?

11:17.922 --> 11:19.822
Everyone is, like,
scary efficient.

11:19.824 --> 11:21.724
Hadn't noticed.
Hadn't noticed, either.

11:23.026 --> 11:24.826
Bull's-eye.

11:24.827 --> 11:26.660

11:26.661 --> 11:28.427
I can do better.

11:28.428 --> 11:32.264
Okay, tell me not everyone
in here is a spy.

11:32.332 --> 11:35.266
Chuck promised Ell he's not
working for the CIA anymore.

11:35.334 --> 11:37.234
I'm worried about her-
she's not sleeping as it is.

11:37.268 --> 11:39.168
If she even thought that
Chuck was still a spy...

11:39.203 --> 11:40.370
Bartowski's out.

11:40.371 --> 11:42.305
Buy More's still
my cover, though.

11:42.373 --> 11:44.540
Sadly, that hasn't changed.

11:45.942 --> 11:48.110
Oh, no.

11:48.178 --> 11:50.378
Something about this place
still seems a lile...

11:52.281 --> 11:53.381
Off.

11:53.382 --> 11:55.282
30 feet.

11:55.552 --> 11:56.820
That's more like it.

11:56.821 --> 11:59.288
Where is
Chuck, Morgan?

11:59.355 --> 12:02.290
You know, we make
a great team, you and I.

12:02.358 --> 12:04.193
You are such a day-saver.

12:04.194 --> 12:07.128
I am super proud of you.
I really am.

12:07.196 --> 12:09.764
Proud of us, really, you know,
and how well we work together.

12:09.831 --> 12:11.566
Any sign of Sofia?

12:11.567 --> 12:13.234
Uh, no, no.
Are you mad at me?

12:13.235 --> 12:14.668
If the weapon wa't
iner purse,

12:14.669 --> 12:16.870
then she certainly didn't have
it with her at the party,

12:16.938 --> 12:19.039
because that dress
didn't conceal much.

12:19.106 --> 12:20.340
I wasn't...

12:20.341 --> 12:21.741
I wasn't looking.

12:21.742 --> 12:23.243
Hey, I wasn't looking,
first of all,

12:23.244 --> 12:25.144
and second of all, it's a
very stressful situation,

12:25.145 --> 12:27.045
watching one's life flash
before one's eyes like that.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.882
And at the end of the day,
and you have to admit this,

12:29.950 --> 12:31.750
I disay, "I love you."

12:31.751 --> 12:33.852
That's what should matter,
right? We can both agree on that.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.287
Chuck, if we hadn't stopped
that bomb, your last words to me

12:36.355 --> 12:38.589
would have been about
my weird unpacking thing.

12:38.657 --> 12:40.557
You're right, and I'm sorry.
I should never have done that.

12:40.559 --> 12:42.459
And the crazy thing is,
I don't even care. I don't.

12:42.494 --> 12:44.461
Spies pack light; I get it.
Yes, we do

12:44.529 --> 12:46.329
pack light, because
we have to be prepared

12:46.330 --> 12:47.630
for the next mission.

12:47.631 --> 12:50.399
And right now, we really
need to focus on this mission.

12:51.568 --> 12:53.569
Let's go, Chuck.

13:03.462 --> 13:05.362
Can I help you, Mr. Grimes?

13:05.396 --> 13:07.230
Yes. Actually,
I'd like to talk to you

13:07.231 --> 13:10.931
about how well things are...
going here at the Buy More.

13:10.999 --> 13:12.933
Things do seem to be
running quite smoothly.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.969
Exactly. Yeah, uh, that seems
to be the problem to me.

13:16.036 --> 13:18.304
It's too right that
it's... it's wrong.

13:19.339 --> 13:21.874
And tell me, Mr. Grimes,

13:21.941 --> 13:24.843
what do you know about
running a CIA base?

13:24.910 --> 13:27.945
Nothing. But I do kn
how to run a Buy More.

13:28.013 --> 13:29.946
And with all due
respect, General,

13:30.014 --> 13:32.681
this is... no
longer a Buy More.

13:33.983 --> 13:35.350
You have five minutes.

13:35.351 --> 13:36.885
I'll only need two.
Walk with me.

13:36.886 --> 13:38.487
You see, one of the
defining characteristics

13:38.488 --> 13:40.722
of the old Buy More was
its inattention to detail.

13:40.789 --> 13:42.289
For example...

13:42.290 --> 13:44.290
take this generic yet...

13:44.358 --> 13:45.624
tasty chocolate drink, right?

13:45.625 --> 13:46.992
Now, a year ago,

13:46.993 --> 13:49.160
this would have sat,
oh, for about a week

13:49.227 --> 13:53.128
until Jeff came along
and lapped it up off the floor.

13:54.264 --> 13:56.498

fresher. Enjoy.

13:58.501 --> 14:01.168
My people were trained to
be observant and efficient.

14:01.235 --> 14:02.835
It's the CIA way.

14:02.836 --> 14:05.271
Ah, but it's not the Buy
More way, you see?

14:05.339 --> 14:07.773
Now, if customers don't
have hazardous spills,

14:07.841 --> 14:09.908
mislabeled product, surly
employees to distract them,

14:09.976 --> 14:12.711
well, they may start

21:46.129 --> 21:48.196
The Buy More's been my home
for eight years,

21:48.264 --> 21:50.765
so without Jeff and Lester,
I think it would just feel

21:50.833 --> 21:52.733
like another
electronics store, you know.

21:55.871 --> 21:57.972
Do you ever miss Ace of Base?

21:58.040 --> 21:59.940
Always.

22:02.711 --> 22:05.279
Jeffrey, we've been made!

22:05.347 --> 22:06.514
Get the suicide pills.

22:06.515 --> 22:08.349
We are going down like
Thelma and Louise,

22:08.350 --> 22:09.950
just like we practiced-
Thelma and/or Louise.

22:09.951 --> 22:12.386
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
They're everywhere!

22:12.453 --> 22:14.455
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I got this. I got this.

22:14.523 --> 22:15.890
We are not the boys
you are looking for.

22:15.891 --> 22:17.725
These are not the boys
that we're looking... Hey.

22:17.726 --> 22:19.327
Cut it out.
Listen to me.

22:19.328 --> 22:21.263
We just came here
to give you your jobs back.

22:21.330 --> 22:23.898
What job?

22:23.966 --> 22:26.000
Your old jobs. Guys,
the Buy More's been rebuilt,

22:26.068 --> 22:27.969
and nobody thinks that
you burned it down.

22:28.037 --> 22:29.771
It's okay. What are
you talking about?

22:29.772 --> 22:31.773
Cars have been
following us for months.

22:31.840 --> 22:34.676
How do you know they weren't
just driving behind you?

22:34.744 --> 22:35.911
Hmm.

22:35.912 --> 22:37.812
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

22:37.847 --> 22:41.481
You came all this way
just to offer us our jobs back?

22:41.549 --> 22:43.216
You're seven minutes
from Burbank with traffic.

22:43.217 --> 22:45.285
No, no, no. No,
no, no, no, no, no.

22:45.353 --> 22:47.119
I see what's happening
here, Jeffrey.

22:47.120 --> 22:50.856
For some unknown reason,
they need us.

22:50.924 --> 22:53.092
We have leverage.

22:53.160 --> 22:54.760
It's time to
negotiate.

22:54.761 --> 22:55.761
All right.

22:55.762 --> 22:58.865
If we take our jobs back...

22:58.933 --> 23:02.101
we want a raise and perks.

23:02.170 --> 23:04.505
The company car
and three kilos...

23:06.175 --> 23:08.075
...gluten-free
biscotti.

23:11.881 --> 23:14.283
I think my water just broke.

23:30.566 --> 23:33.868
This is truly one of the most
degrading things I've ever done.

23:33.936 --> 23:36.504
Look, I know you'd rather be on
a mission with Chuck and Sarah,

23:36.572 --> 23:38.440
but your whole life
doesn't have to be missions.

23:38.441 --> 23:39.841
I was talking to
Alex the other day,

23:39.842 --> 23:41.742
and she said she hadn't
heard from you in a while.

23:41.744 --> 23:44.245
Why are you talking
to my daughter?

23:44.312 --> 23:47.580
More importantly, why
<i>aren't</i> you talking to her?

23:50.484 --> 23:53.919
Well, she has her mom,
friends, whole life.

23:53.986 --> 23:55.987
I just... don't fit in.

23:56.055 --> 23:57.955
You're not gonna
if you don't try.

24:10.841 --> 24:12.777
Hey, Devon.

24:12.845 --> 24:14.279
Need some help?

24:14.280 --> 24:15.847
No. No, no, no, I'm good.

24:15.848 --> 24:19.016
Just shopping, but
I was in the Buy More.

24:19.084 --> 24:20.784
Everyone there was
super-attractive

24:20.785 --> 24:21.952
and highly skilled.

24:21.953 --> 24:23.086
It was like

24:23.087 --> 24:24.554
I work there.

24:24.555 --> 24:27.190
But why would I work
in the Buy More?

24:27.257 --> 24:29.125
Hmm?

24:29.126 --> 24:31.427
Unless I was a spy.

24:31.494 --> 24:33.128
Um, Devon, you know

24:33.129 --> 24:34.829
that Casey and I
are <i>still</i> spies,

24:34.830 --> 24:36.097
and the Buy More
is still a cover,

24:36.098 --> 24:37.298
but Chuck has nothing
to do with it.

24:37.299 --> 24:38.465
Exactly.

24:38.466 --> 24:40.400
I'm out, bro.

24:40.468 --> 24:42.368
I know. I know, man.

24:42.403 --> 24:43.770
I'm sorry I questioned you.

24:43.771 --> 24:46.572
And I know I've been going
a little overboard lately, but

24:46.640 --> 24:50.008
it's just really important
for Ellie, you know, to know

24:50.076 --> 24:53.411
that everyone who is here
is really here for her now.

24:53.478 --> 24:55.279
Okay, that everything's normal.

24:55.280 --> 24:57.180
Yeah, tot...

24:58.149 --> 24:59.383
Totally normal.

24:59.384 --> 25:01.118
<i>Normal,</i>

25:01.119 --> 25:02.286
as the Spanish
would say.

25:02.287 --> 25:03.787
Not

25:03.788 --> 25:04.955
<i>irregular.</i>

25:04.956 --> 25:07.057
Thank you. All right.

25:12.697 --> 25:13.864
Oh, let me help.

25:13.865 --> 25:15.198
No, babe, I got it.

25:15.199 --> 25:17.000
You don't
lift a finger.

25:17.001 --> 25:18.401
What is all this?

25:18.402 --> 25:20.337
Oh, just a few
sleep machines.

25:20.404 --> 25:22.038
You know, rain forest sounds,

25:22.039 --> 25:24.173
white noise,
dolphin chatter, the "yoozh."

25:24.241 --> 25:25.741
Oh, that's very
sweet of you, honey,

25:25.742 --> 25:27.176
but you've already
done so much already.

25:27.177 --> 25:28.477
I mean, look
at the apartment.

25:28.478 --> 25:30.346
You have two
bassinets, we have

25:30.347 --> 25:32.182
a kitchen full of baby

25:32.183 --> 25:33.416
vegan food.

25:33.417 --> 25:35.018
Sweetheart, we are not vegan.

25:35.019 --> 25:36.386
But we could be.

25:36.387 --> 25:39.122
I just want to know
what's really going on here.

25:39.190 --> 25:41.024
We both know
that you're not good

25:41.025 --> 25:42.326
at letting people help you.

25:42.327 --> 25:44.528
Oh, you've practically
raised Chuck

25:44.595 --> 25:46.495
on your own since your mom...

25:47.665 --> 25:48.932
So this is about my mom?

25:48.933 --> 25:50.434
No! What?

25:50.435 --> 25:51.835
No.

25:51.836 --> 25:54.438
Devon, you are the worst liar
in the world.

25:54.505 --> 25:56.807
Just tell me.
Is this about my mom?

25:57.809 --> 25:59.609
Yes.

25:59.610 --> 26:01.211
I just don't
want you to feel

26:01.212 --> 26:02.579
like anyone or
anything is missing.

26:02.580 --> 26:04.747
Well, I don't want you
to be worried about me.

26:04.815 --> 26:07.650
I don't feel
like anything is missing.

26:07.718 --> 26:10.086
I didn't need my mom
when I was a teenager,

26:10.154 --> 26:13.423
I didn't need her in med school,
and I don't need her now, okay?

26:13.490 --> 26:16.125
You and Chuck

26:16.193 --> 26:19.128
are the only family
that I need.

26:19.196 --> 26:22.264
Okay.

26:22.332 --> 26:23.799
So let's make a deal.

26:23.800 --> 26:25.601
I will let you help me,

26:25.602 --> 26:27.803
but you have to let me
pitch in, too.

26:29.406 --> 26:31.740
We're better as a team.

26:34.244 --> 26:36.345
Don't do that.

26:36.412 --> 26:38.347
What?

26:38.414 --> 26:40.782
Don't unpack, please.

26:40.850 --> 26:42.451
If you do it now,
it's only gonna be

26:42.452 --> 26:43.685
because we were
talking about it, and

26:43.686 --> 26:45.053
I don't want you
to do it because of that.

26:45.054 --> 26:46.555
I want you to do it
when you feel comfortable here,

26:46.556 --> 26:47.723
when you feel at home.

26:47.724 --> 26:49.391
I do feel comfortable here.

26:49.392 --> 26:50.759
It just...

26:50.760 --> 26:53.195
It doesn't come naturally to me,
putting roots down.

26:53.262 --> 26:55.197
I know.

26:55.264 --> 26:57.566
You were always on
the run with your dad,

26:57.633 --> 27:00.969
and being a spy doesn't make it
easy to make a home anywhere.

27:01.037 --> 27:02.437
I understand.

27:02.438 --> 27:05.674
It's just what
you're used to.

27:05.741 --> 27:07.676
But I love you

27:07.744 --> 27:09.945
because we're different.

27:12.381 --> 27:16.251
And one dress is not going
to make or break us.

27:20.756 --> 27:22.657
One dress.

27:22.725 --> 27:24.693
What?

27:24.761 --> 27:28.396
Sofia unpacked everything except
for that one sequined dress.

27:28.464 --> 27:30.298
Right, she put it in a suitcase.

27:30.299 --> 27:32.199
Haven't we seen
that dress before?

27:32.235 --> 27:33.535
On the security cam footage.

27:33.536 --> 27:35.637
Why would a model wear
the same dress twice

27:35.705 --> 27:37.605
when she has a closet
full of options?

27:37.673 --> 27:40.241
Because maybe it's not
just a dress.

27:40.309 --> 27:41.442
Beckman said the technology

27:41.443 --> 27:42.576
was in the microchip,
not the bullet.

27:42.577 --> 27:43.744
What if the chips...?

27:43.745 --> 27:45.345
Are hidden in the dress-
the sequins?

27:45.346 --> 27:46.513
And when Fashion Week ends,

27:46.514 --> 27:47.680
she's gonna slip the
dress through customs.

27:47.681 --> 27:48.848
Through one of
the collections.

27:48.849 --> 27:50.016
That means she's still in Milan.

27:50.017 --> 27:51.384
Closing night is
tomorrow night.

27:51.385 --> 27:53.419
We need to get back
there right now.

27:53.487 --> 27:55.788
Well, it's a good thing
we're already packed.

28:14.873 --> 28:17.442
If Sofia is hiding the dress
in one of those collections,

28:17.509 --> 28:19.877
it should be
in one of the backstage areas.

28:19.945 --> 28:21.546
Yeah, I'm gonna
guess it's that one.

28:21.547 --> 28:24.015
Those look like our men. You
think this plan will really work?

28:24.083 --> 28:25.383
Absolutely.

28:25.384 --> 28:28.453
Watch me.

28:28.521 --> 28:30.823
Hey. <i>Signore, signore.</i>

28:30.890 --> 28:32.790
<i>Buona sera.</i>

28:33.227 --> 28:35.127
<i>Buona sera.</i>

28:35.430 --> 28:36.696
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

28:36.697 --> 28:37.964
It's a pleasure.
Pleasure.

28:37.965 --> 28:39.465
My name is Charles Carmichael,

28:39.466 --> 28:41.367
and I know that's got
to be very confusing

28:41.435 --> 28:43.136
for you right now,
so let me explain.

28:43.137 --> 28:45.038
I'm actually the guy
that you're looking for, and

28:45.106 --> 28:46.907
unfortunately for you,
I'm gonna need the dress

28:46.908 --> 28:48.808
that's right behind that door.

28:51.079 --> 28:52.513
And good night.

28:52.514 --> 28:54.849
Well, that went better
than I thought it would.

28:54.917 --> 28:58.120
What? You don't have any faith
in my tranq gloves?

28:58.187 --> 29:00.522
Come on.
I'm pretty proud of them.

29:03.727 --> 29:05.060
Okay, you take that side.

29:05.061 --> 29:07.228
The rack, okay.
And you go... Okay.

29:10.630 --> 29:12.464
Excuse me.

29:12.465 --> 29:13.964
Okay, we need
to be quick, remember.

29:13.965 --> 29:16.299
Going as fast as I can.
There's a lot of dresses here.

29:16.367 --> 29:18.268
None of those.

29:18.336 --> 29:20.136
Oh. Bingo.

29:20.137 --> 29:21.004
Bingo. Hey.

29:21.005 --> 29:22.172
Check it out. Found it.

29:22.173 --> 29:23.440
Oh, good.

29:23.441 --> 29:25.675
Here.

29:25.743 --> 29:27.910
Oh. Hi-yo.

29:27.978 --> 29:30.380
I just got to say-
this-this was a great idea.

29:30.447 --> 29:32.015
I mean, as far
as missions.

29:32.016 --> 29:34.284
Best ever.

29:34.351 --> 29:35.585
Zip?
Of course, yes.

29:35.586 --> 29:39.556
You hold, and I
zip- bada-bing.

29:39.624 --> 29:40.790
Slip it back into this.

29:40.791 --> 29:42.058
And Bob's your uncle.

29:42.059 --> 29:43.225
Bra.
Of course.

29:43.226 --> 29:44.793
Strapless dress.
What was I thinking?

29:44.794 --> 29:46.528
Okay.
Let's go home.

29:46.529 --> 29:47.795
Shall we?

29:47.796 --> 29:49.097
Try in here.

29:49.098 --> 29:50.698
Okay, slight problem.

29:50.699 --> 29:52.599
Uh, here, go.

29:59.205 --> 30:01.105
I love you, Sarah.

30:02.573 --> 30:04.473
Chuck!

30:07.076 --> 30:08.976
I think
you got something of mine.

30:19.051 --> 30:20.218
Drop it.

30:20.219 --> 30:23.352
Oh. Oh...

30:23.420 --> 30:25.053
Five on one.

30:25.054 --> 30:27.188
Five on one.
Yeah, not the greatest odds.

30:27.255 --> 30:29.456
I get it. I get it.

30:46.241 --> 30:48.811
You messed things up
with Miss Sofia.

30:48.879 --> 30:51.647
No, I didn't mess up anything
with Miss Sofia, okay?

30:51.715 --> 30:53.215
You really didn't
stand a chance.

30:53.216 --> 30:55.450
She's cold and distant
and-and...

30:55.517 --> 30:57.184
Here we go.

30:57.185 --> 30:58.485
Here we go...
That's not...

30:58.486 --> 31:00.452
Could you hold that
just for a second?

31:00.520 --> 31:01.820
Thanks.

31:01.821 --> 31:03.821
That's what I'm looking for.

31:06.058 --> 31:08.560
You slapped me.
Well... Aah.

31:26.044 --> 31:27.945
Red is a good
look for you.

31:28.013 --> 31:31.214
It distracts
from your face.

33:13.583 --> 33:17.487
Bravo!

33:39.640 --> 33:42.942
I assure you, General,
my cover is still intact.

33:43.009 --> 33:44.243
I know.

33:44.244 --> 33:46.345
The two of you acted
quickly and intelligently.

33:46.413 --> 33:48.046
And because of
your efforts,

33:48.047 --> 33:49.915
we recovered the smart
bullet guidance chips

33:49.916 --> 33:51.250
and put one
of Volkoff's

33:51.251 --> 33:54.152
key sellers behind bars.

33:54.220 --> 33:56.922
Well done.

33:56.990 --> 33:59.791
It feels good to
be back at work.

33:59.859 --> 34:02.361
Feels good to be home.

34:05.699 --> 34:07.366
Hey!

34:07.367 --> 34:09.201
I made you a protein shake
with baby boost, babe.

34:09.202 --> 34:12.704
Thanks, honey.
I'm actually headed out, though.

34:12.772 --> 34:16.373
My husband bought sleep machines
in excess the other day,

34:16.440 --> 34:17.942
so I'm heading to the Buy More
to return them.

34:17.943 --> 34:20.177
No! I mean...

34:20.245 --> 34:22.079
