39:05.143 --> 39:08.514
* I can't do anything

39:08.914 --> 39:10.482
Hey, Mia.

39:10.516 --> 39:12.584
No, I-I'm fine.

39:12.618 --> 39:15.286
I'm just, uh,

39:15.320 --> 39:17.322
just tired.

39:19.090 --> 39:20.626
Hey.

39:21.660 --> 39:23.729
I have to be, uh,

39:24.730 --> 39:26.632
closer to you guys.

39:29.401 --> 39:31.036
I'm gonna move back.

39:34.339 --> 39:35.841
Hey, is Kellan there?

39:35.874 --> 39:38.043
I need to hear his voice.

39:38.410 --> 39:42.347
**

39:42.380 --> 39:48.319
* Love is coming
coming for to carry me

39:48.353 --> 39:51.490
* I don't know anything

39:51.523 --> 39:53.925
(CRYING) Hey, son.

39:54.960 --> 40:00.866
* Love is coming
coming for to carry me

40:00.899 --> 40:04.903
* I don't know anything

40:05.370 --> 40:10.876
**

40:10.909 --> 40:16.214
**

40:16.247 --> 40:21.753
**

40:21.787 --> 40:23.655
(BOTH CRYING)

40:23.689 --> 40:30.061
**

40:31.129 --> 40:37.803
**

40:38.870 --> 40:44.943
**

40:46.111 --> 40:48.013
We should
get a drink sometime.

40:48.747 --> 40:50.281
I'd like that.

40:51.082 --> 40:57.188
**

40:58.624 --> 41:00.859
I made a promise to Vera.

41:00.892 --> 41:07.298
**

41:10.135 --> 41:12.604
I don't know
what that was.

41:12.638 --> 41:15.473
It could be
a practice kiss

41:15.507 --> 41:17.475
or a pity kiss
or a goodbye kiss.

41:17.509 --> 41:22.213
That was an
"I'm such a stupid idiot
for not seeing it,

41:23.582 --> 41:26.351
"but I love you
with all my heart" kiss.

41:28.219 --> 41:30.155
And this is another.

41:30.922 --> 41:33.992
**

41:34.025 --> 41:36.662
* Send the rain

41:37.195 --> 41:40.431
* Send my love

41:40.465 --> 41:42.968
* Send my love to everyone

41:43.001 --> 41:46.471
Vera didn't die,
so the promise
doesn't count.

41:47.673 --> 41:50.576
* Send the rain

41:50.609 --> 41:51.910
* Send my love

41:51.943 --> 41:54.012
You make me
more, Shaun.

41:54.045 --> 42:01.019
* Send my love to everyone

42:01.052 --> 42:04.389
* Send the rain

42:04.422 --> 42:08.026
* Send my love

42:08.059 --> 42:14.532
* Send my love to everyone

42:14.566 --> 42:18.003
* Send the rain

42:18.036 --> 42:21.506
* Send my love

42:21.539 --> 42:28.546
* Send my love to everyone *

42:31.883 --> 42:36.087
**

42:42.427 --> 42:49.400
**

42:51.536 --> 42:58.276
**
