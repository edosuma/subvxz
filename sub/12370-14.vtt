- CHILL, YOU KNOW HOW YOU GO
ON A TROPICAL VACATION

10:22.830 --> 10:25.082
AND YOU BUY A PINEAPPLE PURSE,
AND YOU GET IT HOME

10:25.166 --> 10:27.418
AND YOU WONDER,
"WHAT WAS I THINKING?

10:27.501 --> 10:30.212
NOW THAT DOESN'T BELONG HERE"?
- COMPLETELY.

10:30.296 --> 10:33.883
ON ST. LUCIA, THEY SELL THESE
PUKA SHELL FLIP-FLOPS.

10:33.966 --> 10:34.800
I BOUGHT A PAIR,

10:34.884 --> 10:37.178
AND I BROUGHT THEM BACK
TO MY ISLAND.

10:37.261 --> 10:39.889
[chuckles]
LOOKED TOTALLY CRAZY THERE!

10:41.474 --> 10:43.392
VICTORIA, COME TO ME.
COME TO ME.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.894
PLEASE, COME INTO
OUR OHIO HAMMOCK.

10:44.977 --> 10:46.228
- NO, IT'S--

10:46.312 --> 10:48.022
IT'S A LITTLE TOO COLD.

10:48.105 --> 10:50.232
- LET CHILL MAKE YOU HOT.
- NO, LET--

10:50.316 --> 10:53.694
ACTUALLY, WHAT I WOULD PREFER IS
IF YOU JUST PUT SOME PAJAMAS ON.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.571
- BUT NIGHT IS TIME TO BE FREE.

10:55.654 --> 10:59.075
- WELL, I'M SORRY, BUT I PREFER
A MAN WHO WEARS PAJAMAS.

10:59.158 --> 11:01.744
BUT I UNDERSTAND
IF THAT'S A DEAL BREAKER.

11:01.827 --> 11:04.246
MESSAGE RECEIVED.
- NO.

11:04.330 --> 11:08.376
I WILL PUT ON THESE "PAJAMAS."

11:08.459 --> 11:12.505
FOR YOU, I WILL FORCE THIS
TERRIBLE MATERIAL UPON MY SKIN.

11:12.588 --> 11:14.423
- IT'S FLANNEL.

11:14.507 --> 11:17.551
- "FLANN-EL."

11:17.635 --> 11:20.930
SO STIFF.
SO UNNATURAL.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.436
- I'M GLAD YOU WANTED
TO TALK, REJOYLA.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.314
I KNOW YOU DON'T APPROVE
OF DANIEL.

11:30.398 --> 11:32.817
- WELL, I'M NOT HERE TO ARGUE.

11:32.900 --> 11:35.778
I JUST WANT US TO BE ABLE
TO TALK AS FRIENDS.

11:35.861 --> 11:38.739
- THAT'S MY WISH AS WELL.

11:38.823 --> 11:42.326
AND LET ME TELL YOU, JOY,

11:42.410 --> 11:45.121
GIRLFRIEND TO GIRLFRIEND...
- [laughs]

11:45.204 --> 11:48.332
- I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED
SUCH INTENSE PLEASURE

11:48.416 --> 11:50.209
AS I HAVE WITH DANIEL.

11:53.379 --> 11:58.801
YOUR FATHER TOLD ME I WAS HAVING
ORGASMS ALL THOSE YEARS,

11:58.884 --> 12:01.637
BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT I WASN'T.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.598
I WAS JUST HAVING THE AIR
SQUEEZED OUT OF ME

12:04.682 --> 12:07.309
BY HIS PORTLY FRAME.

12:09.770 --> 12:14.150
- WELL, THAT'S...VIVID.

12:14.233 --> 12:17.069
BUT PASSING LIGHTLY FROM SEX--

12:17.153 --> 12:20.364
- YOU KNOW, I'M FINALLY
BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND

12:20.448 --> 12:24.118
WHY YOU SLEEP AROUND SO MUCH.

12:24.201 --> 12:27.371
YOU KNOW, DANIEL DOES
THIS THING.

12:27.455 --> 12:29.165
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
HE LEARNED IT,

12:29.248 --> 12:32.209
OR WHAT WONDERFUL WOMAN TAUGHT
IT TO HIM,

12:32.293 --> 12:36.672
BUT IT'S WAVE AFTER WAVE
OF ECSTASY.

12:36.755 --> 12:39.049
WHOO!
A LITTLE AFTERSHOCK.

12:43.012 --> 12:45.014
OH, IT'S SO GOOD TO SHARE.

12:45.097 --> 12:47.850
AFTER YEARS OF TENSE ROWS,

12:47.933 --> 12:50.686
FRIENDS IS SO MUCH NICER.

12:50.769 --> 12:53.022
- [laughs]
ISN'T IT?

12:53.105 --> 12:54.982
AND, AS A FRIEND,

12:55.065 --> 12:58.486
I WAS JUST WONDERING WHAT YOU
REALLY KNOW ABOUT DANIEL,

12:58.569 --> 13:03.073
BECAUSE I CHECKED ONLINE--
AS FRIENDS DO--

13:03.157 --> 13:05.534
AND I COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING
ABOUT HIM.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.661
- SO YOU'RE SAYING
YOU DON'T TRUST HIM?

13:07.745 --> 13:11.707
- NO, NO, I'M JUST SAYING
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET HURT.

13:11.790 --> 13:14.168
- YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED AT ALL.

13:14.251 --> 13:16.086
YOU JUST CAN'T STAND IT
WHEN I'M HAPPY!

13:16.170 --> 13:17.338
- WHAT?

13:17.421 --> 13:20.382
I HAVE ONLY EVER WANTED YOU
TO BE HAPPY.

13:20.466 --> 13:21.550
AND YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO PICKED HOLES

13:21.634 --> 13:23.219
IN EVERY RELATIONSHIP
I EVER HAD.

13:23.302 --> 13:25.679
- WELL, I WAS WRONG!
I SHOULD HAVE SAID,

13:25.763 --> 13:26.931
"IF YOU'RE HAPPY, I'M HAPPY."

13:27.014 --> 13:29.225
- NO, NO, I WAS WRONG.

13:29.308 --> 13:32.228
I SHOULD HAVE SAID, "THANK YOU
FOR RIGHTLY POINTING OUT

13:32.311 --> 13:36.232
THAT I WAS MAKING HORRIBLE
CHOICES THAT WILL END IN TEARS."

13:36.315 --> 13:38.400
DANIEL IS OBVIOUSLY AFTER
YOUR MONEY.

13:38.484 --> 13:41.570
- BECAUSE HE COULDN'T POSSIBLY
LOVE ME FOR WHO I AM.

13:41.654 --> 13:44.406
- NO, I JUST THINK YOU NEED
TO END THIS, IMMEDIATELY.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.450
- YOU ARE NOT MY MOTHER!

13:46.534 --> 13:49.870
- THEN STOP ACTING LIKE A CHILD!

13:49.954 --> 13:52.373
AS LONG AS YOU'RE UNDER MY ROOF,
IT'S MY RULES!

13:52.456 --> 13:54.250
- YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING!

13:54.333 --> 13:58.754
AND YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT
MY FEELINGS!

13:58.837 --> 14:00.756
- AND DON'T YOU DARE SLAM THAT--

14:00.839 --> 14:03.342
[door slams]

14:05.553 --> 14:07.304
SO, FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE,

14:07.388 --> 14:09.265
I MUST LIVE WITH THE KNOWLEDGE

14:09.348 --> 14:12.101
THAT I GAVE MY MOTHER
HER FIRST ORGASM.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.647
- WELL, I CAN TOP THAT.

14:16.730 --> 14:19.775
I WENT ON A THREE-WEEK VACATION
AND ALL I HAVE TO SHOW FOR IT

14:19.858 --> 14:21.652
IS A FILTHY BEACH BUM
WHOSE FILTHY BEACH BUM

14:21.735 --> 14:23.571
IS ON MY SILK PILLOWS.

14:26.532 --> 14:29.118
- HEY, IT'S 12:05.

14:29.201 --> 14:30.953
- AND THE MURDER HAPPENED
AT MIDNIGHT.

14:31.036 --> 14:32.121
YOU'RE SAFE!
- [laughs]

14:32.204 --> 14:36.500
[thunder cracks]

14:36.584 --> 14:41.297
- ELKA, DO YOU STILL SET
YOUR WATCH FIVE MINUTES FAST?

14:41.380 --> 14:43.132
- YES.

14:51.265 --> 14:52.433
[thunder rumbles]

14:52.516 --> 14:54.518
- USUALLY, WHEN I DO A SEANCE,

14:54.602 --> 14:59.189
I SUMMON THE SPIRITS UNDER
THE MOONLIGHT ON THE WARM BEACH

14:59.273 --> 15:02.192
AFTER I'VE MADE LOVE TO EVERYONE
IN THE CIRCLE.

15:05.571 --> 15:07.281
ANYONE?

15:07.364 --> 15:09.825
OKAY, RAIN CHECK.

15:09.908 --> 15:12.244
LET THE SEANCE BEGIN.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.455
MARY, SPEAK THROUGH US.

15:14.538 --> 15:18.792
SPIRIT OF MARY, COME ON DOWN!

15:21.086 --> 15:24.298
- I AM THE SPIRIT OF MARY.

15:24.381 --> 15:27.468
I HAVE A MESSAGE
FOR THE ISLAND MAN.

15:27.551 --> 15:32.097
GO HOME.
YOU MUST GO HOME.

15:35.267 --> 15:37.519
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

15:37.603 --> 15:39.521
WHAT DID THE GHOST SAY?
OH, WE MUST OBEY HER.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.359
- DON'T WORRY,
MY PRECIOUS VICTORIA.

15:43.442 --> 15:46.362
YOUR ISLAND MAN'S
NOT GOING NOWHERE.

15:46.445 --> 15:48.906
- AND I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE
EITHER.

15:48.989 --> 15:52.868
I FEEL THE SPIRIT IS TELLING ME
TO STAY IN CLEVELAND.

15:52.951 --> 15:55.996
- WHAT?
RACHEL.

15:56.080 --> 15:59.541
DON'T BE CRAZY.
GO BACK TO SCOTTSDALE.

15:59.625 --> 16:02.586
- IT'S PHOENIX.
- SAME AIRPORT.

16:02.670 --> 16:05.214
[thunder cracks]

16:05.297 --> 16:08.759
- TELL ME ABOUT THE MURDER.
WHO WERE THE SUSPECTS?

16:08.842 --> 16:11.929
- THERE WERE TWO.
THE FIRST WAS MARY'S DAUGHTER,

16:12.012 --> 16:14.890
AND THE SECOND WAS A FOREIGN MAN
THAT MARY WAS DATING.

16:14.973 --> 16:16.725
- I BET THE DAUGHTER DID IT.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.603
SHE PROBABLY COULDN'T TAKE
HER MOTHER'S STUBBORN ATTITUDE.

16:19.687 --> 16:23.273
- MAYBE MARY WAS HAPPY
FOR ONCE IN HER LIFE,

16:23.357 --> 16:25.067
AND HER DAUGHTER
COULDN'T STAND IT.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.111
- I'M SURE IT WAS
THE FOREIGN MAN.

16:27.194 --> 16:31.240
IF HE'D JUST GONE HOME,
EVERYTHING WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE.

16:31.323 --> 16:33.951
- THIS SEANCE STINKS.

16:34.034 --> 16:38.080
{\an1}- YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU'RE A BIT
JEALOUS THAT A MAN LIKE DANIEL

16:38.163 --> 16:39.581
WOULDN'T LOOK AT YOU TWICE.

16:39.665 --> 16:40.666
- I GIVE UP.

16:40.749 --> 16:45.254
YOU JUST KEEP MAKING IT HARDER.
HARDER! HARDER!

16:45.337 --> 16:47.881
- HARDER...HARDER...
NOW, WHERE HAVE I HEARD THAT?

16:47.965 --> 16:49.633
[gasps]

16:49.717 --> 16:52.052
OH, MY GOD!

16:52.136 --> 16:53.220
- DANIEL, WHAT'S WRONG?

16:53.303 --> 16:55.681
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'VE SEEN A GHOST.

16:55.764 --> 16:58.434
- WHAT?
THIS NEVER WORKED BEFORE.

17:00.477 --> 17:05.065
I MEAN, WELCOME, SPIRIT.

17:05.148 --> 17:06.316
- I REALLY COULD USE A DRINK.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.361
- YOU HEARD HIM, REJOYLA.
GET DANIEL A DRINK.

17:11.363 --> 17:14.782
- WHY SO SAD, SAD GIRL?

17:14.867 --> 17:16.952
I AM FROM AN ISLAND,

17:17.035 --> 17:20.830
BUT YOU, YOU ARE AN ISLAND.

17:20.914 --> 17:24.417
- THAT IS SO DEEP.

17:24.501 --> 17:29.339
- VICTORIA, WILL YOU SHARE ME?

17:30.883 --> 17:31.592
- I'M SORRY?

17:31.675 --> 17:33.844
- SHARE?

17:35.679 --> 17:37.097
- I WILL.

17:37.181 --> 17:39.308
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A SAYING
IN THIS COUNTRY.

17:39.391 --> 17:41.810
IF YOU LOVE SOMETHING,
SET IT FREE.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.979
AND IF IT COMES BACK TO YOU,
JUST KEEP SETTING IT FREE

17:44.062 --> 17:46.982
UNTIL IT GETS THE MESSAGE.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.443
- SO, YOU REMEMBER EVERYTHING?

17:49.526 --> 17:52.488
- YES, YOUR ANGRY SEX SOUNDS
BROUGHT IT ALL BACK TO ME.

17:52.571 --> 17:53.989
[thunder rumbles]

17:54.072 --> 17:55.783
[sighs]
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

17:55.866 --> 17:57.493
PHILIPA WILL BE DEVASTATED.

17:57.576 --> 18:00.496
BUT WE AGREED FROM THE START,
NO SECRETS.

18:00.579 --> 18:03.624
IN FACT, IT'S HER FRANK HONESTY
THAT I LOVE MOST ABOUT HER.

18:03.707 --> 18:07.169
- YES, FRANK HONESTY IS ONE
OF HER LEADING QUALITIES.

18:07.252 --> 18:09.546
- BUT THERE'S SO MUCH MORE
TO HER.

18:09.630 --> 18:11.673
WE DISCOVER NEW THINGS
ABOUT EACH OTHER EVERY DAY.

18:11.757 --> 18:16.345
IT'S LIKE WE'RE BOTH FINALLY
FINDING OUT WHAT LOVE REALLY IS.

18:16.428 --> 18:18.388
[sighs]
I'LL BE LOST IF I LOSE HER.

18:18.472 --> 18:21.517
- OH, DANIEL, THAT'S LOVELY.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.519
I DON'T RECALL SUCH DEPTH
OF FEELING FROM YOU.

18:23.602 --> 18:26.188
- WELL, I WASN'T LIKE THIS
BACK THEN.

18:26.271 --> 18:27.189
- AND EVEN IF YOU HAD BEEN,

18:27.272 --> 18:29.191
I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SMART
ENOUGH TO SEE IT.

18:29.274 --> 18:31.985
- YEAH.
WE WERE TWO DIFFERENT,

18:32.069 --> 18:34.696
RATHER INFERIOR, PEOPLE.

18:34.780 --> 18:40.202
- SO, SINCE OUR THING HAPPENED
TO TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE,

18:40.285 --> 18:43.205
WHY SHOULD THESE TWO PEOPLE
HERE NOW--

18:43.288 --> 18:46.750
WHO BOTH WANT TO KEEP FROM
HURTING THAT WOMAN OUT THERE--

18:46.834 --> 18:49.962
EVEN BRING IT UP?

18:53.048 --> 18:54.716
- WHAT HAVE YOU TWO
BEEN TALKING ABOUT?

18:54.800 --> 18:57.386
- OH, JUST GETTING TO KNOW
EACH OTHER.

18:57.469 --> 19:00.347
AND THE MORE I DO,
THE MORE I REALIZE

19:00.430 --> 19:03.058
HOW GOOD DANIEL IS FOR YOU.

19:03.141 --> 19:05.394
SO, I GIVE YOU MY BLESSING.

19:05.477 --> 19:08.897
- WELL, I HARDLY NEED
A BLESSING FROM YOU.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.567
BUT IT WARMS MY HEART TO GET IT.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.569
- OH, MOM.
- OH.

19:13.652 --> 19:14.945
- WELL, I'D SAY IT'S BEEN
A GOOD NIGHT.

19:15.028 --> 19:16.071
- MM.
- I MEAN, EVEN ELKA MANAGED

19:16.154 --> 19:18.574
TO AVOID MARY'S GHOST OR SPIRIT
OR WHATEVER IT IS.

19:18.657 --> 19:19.950
[laughter]

19:20.033 --> 19:21.743
- I FEEL A LITTLE CHEATED.

THERE'D BE SOMETHING.

[thunder rumbling]

19:34.756 --> 19:36.466
THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING.

19:44.892 --> 19:47.769
- ELKA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN MY BED?

19:47.853 --> 19:50.188
THE STORM'S OVER.
- I KNOW THAT,

19:50.272 --> 19:52.941
BUT GEORGE IS STILL TERRIFIED.
LOOK AT HIM.

19:55.819 --> 19:59.781
- ALL RIGHT, FINE.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.742
I TALKED TO THE POLICE.

20:01.825 --> 20:03.952
THEY BELIEVE THE BONES
IN THE FIREPLACE

20:04.036 --> 20:07.456
BELONG TO A LOCAL BURGLAR
WHO DISAPPEARED 50 YEARS AGO.

20:07.539 --> 20:10.626
THEIR THEORY IS THAT
HE ROBBED AND MURDERED MARY,

20:10.709 --> 20:12.169
ATTEMPTED TO ESCAPE UP
THE CHIMNEY

20:12.252 --> 20:14.630
WHERE HE BUMPED HIS HEAD
AND DIED.

20:14.713 --> 20:16.465
- AND HE'S BEEN UP THERE
THIS WHOLE TIME?

20:16.548 --> 20:17.466
- YES.

20:17.549 --> 20:19.092
WHICH BEGS THE QUESTION,

20:19.176 --> 20:20.928
DON'T YOU EVER HAVE
THE CHIMNEY CLEANED?

20:23.513 --> 20:25.682
GOOD NIGHT, ELKA.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.809
- GOOD NIGHT, JOY.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.978
I'LL BE HERE WHEN YOU WAKE UP
IN THE MORNING.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.189
- WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT?

20:32.272 --> 20:34.232
- I THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE
TO HEAR IT ONCE.
