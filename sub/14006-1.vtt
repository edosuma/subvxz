02:14.830 --> 02:16.000
Detective Blood, half naked,

02:16.001 --> 02:17.599
wandering the streets at 7:00 A.M.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.300
Detective Just your type.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
You get a name?

02:21.001 --> 02:22.699
She's not responsive.

02:22.700 --> 02:24.200
All we found on her was this.

02:25.500 --> 02:28.800
"Hollis M. Nye, attorney-at-law. "

02:29.900 --> 02:31.599
The rest is a mess.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.099
I guess we know her lawyer.

02:33.100 --> 02:34.199
Or her John.

02:34.200 --> 02:35.600
Or both.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.400
You want to get her some clothes?

02:44.900 --> 02:47.400
Who the hell are you, sweetheart?

02:47.700 --> 02:50.899
Ellen, I think you'll find
our offer more than fair

02:50.900 --> 02:52.800
for someone just out of law school.

02:53.400 --> 02:56.399
We'd like to bring you
in as a junior associate,

02:56.400 --> 03:00.900
five years guaranteed
with a starting salary of...

03:01.200 --> 03:02.899
Ellen Holy shit.

03:02.900 --> 03:05.100
Damn right, "holy shit. "

03:05.500 --> 03:07.100
Congratulations.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.899
You can go ahead and breathe now.

03:08.900 --> 03:11.800
Saying yes is going to be the easy part.

03:15.700 --> 03:16.900
Ellen...

03:18.400 --> 03:20.500
with whom else have you met?

03:21.400 --> 03:23.399
No one, Mr. Nye, but

03:23.400 --> 03:26.900
Hewes & associates called me yesterday.

03:28.800 --> 03:30.300
Patty Hewes.

03:31.300 --> 03:34.799
Well... good luck to you.

03:34.800 --> 03:38.200
You might have mentioned that sooner. Hmm?

03:40.200 --> 03:42.400
All right, I'll tell ms. Hewes.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.599
$25 million is their final offer.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.000
No, it isn't.

03:48.200 --> 03:50.400
They don't have the stomach for a verdict.

03:51.100 --> 03:52.599
The answer's "no," Mr. Cutler.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.800
Enough of this shit.

03:55.300 --> 03:58.299
Would you please put Patty on the phone?

03:58.300 --> 03:59.800
Shayes He wants to talk to you.

04:01.800 --> 04:03.499
Nothing's changed, Mr. Cutler.

04:03.500 --> 04:06.300
$150 million to settle.

04:06.600 --> 04:08.400
Put her on the goddamned line.

04:14.700 --> 04:15.899
Yes, martin.

04:15.900 --> 04:18.298
You want to be professional for a second?

04:18.300 --> 04:21.399
Spring's almost here. I adore it.

04:21.399 --> 04:23.100
Rebirth.

04:23.300 --> 04:25.599
Do you think that's because
I'm a water sign?

04:25.600 --> 04:27.799
I'm trying to do you a favor, Patty.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.850
You see the way that forewoman
was looking at me?

04:29.851 --> 04:31.699
I'm a pisces, what are you?

04:31.700 --> 04:33.600
Who gives a shit?

04:36.900 --> 04:38.299
Fine. Aries.

04:38.300 --> 04:39.505
April 3rd,

04:39.506 --> 04:41.445
house of the rising

04:41.446 --> 04:44.794
retrograde mercury bullshit.

04:46.300 --> 04:48.099
$25 million, Patty.

04:48.100 --> 04:50.499
Aries is a fire sign, martin.

04:50.500 --> 04:51.882
25, Patty.

04:51.883 --> 04:53.499
Throw me back something I can work with.

04:53.500 --> 04:56.300
Your sign's function in life
is to resolve conflict.

04:57.700 --> 05:00.800
Cutler You're right. 25.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.500
I guess this time you came up short.

05:04.900 --> 05:05.999
This is charity, Patty.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.645
I shredded your experts on cross.

05:07.646 --> 05:08.697
Did you?

05:08.698 --> 05:10.710
You didn't prove my client was at fault.

05:11.600 --> 05:13.700
Children died, martin.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Ms. Hewes?

05:16.001 --> 05:17.600
The verdict's coming in.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.299
It's your last chance to get off cheap.

05:20.300 --> 05:21.300
150.

05:21.301 --> 05:23.799
50, Patty. Tops.

05:23.800 --> 05:26.000
Reggie dwayne thomas.

05:26.362 --> 05:27.499
Who the hell's that?

05:27.500 --> 05:30.199
A second grader and a mets fan.

05:30.200 --> 05:32.099
You know him as patient 61.

05:32.100 --> 05:34.399
As his immune system was being decimated,

05:34.400 --> 05:35.833
reggie asked me for wo things...

05:35.834 --> 05:36.844
75, Patty.

05:36.845 --> 05:38.799
...That his team make the playoffs

05:38.800 --> 05:42.000
and that someone punish
the company that made him sick.

05:43.400 --> 05:45.199
All right, goddamn it, 150!

05:45.200 --> 05:46.900
That's it, we're done.

05:48.300 --> 05:50.100
Soon as you tell it to the judge.

06:00.200 --> 06:01.500
150.

06:05.700 --> 06:07.700
You're a real hard-dicked bitch,
you know that?

06:08.700 --> 06:10.500
Afternoon, madam foreman.

06:12.100 --> 06:14.099
I thought you just reached a verdict.

06:14.100 --> 06:17.498
Not at quiznos, we didn't.
We broke for lunch.

06:18.875 --> 06:21.500
If you were a man,
I'd kick the living dogshit out of you.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.600
If you were a man, I'd be worried.

06:30.600 --> 06:34.499
And then I left 150 grand on the table.

06:34.500 --> 06:37.458
That's twice the money
my parents make in a year.

06:37.700 --> 06:38.900
Combined.

06:40.300 --> 06:41.799
Am I crazy?

06:41.800 --> 06:42.900
David I hope so.

06:51.800 --> 06:53.299
You want to grab a table?

06:53.300 --> 06:54.900
First round's on me.

06:57.700 --> 06:59.599
What the hell is he doing here?

06:59.600 --> 07:00.700
Who?

07:06.300 --> 07:07.700
Mr. Nye.

07:08.300 --> 07:09.899
I was told this is your spot.

07:09.900 --> 07:11.900
All my secrets are out, huh?

07:12.900 --> 07:14.899
I appreciate your offer today.

07:14.900 --> 07:16.499
Oh, no, no, no, we're fine.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.400
We have a lot of good candidates.

07:18.700 --> 07:20.400
It's you I'm worried about.

07:21.200 --> 07:24.471
Say, is, uh... is that your boyfriend?

07:25.100 --> 07:26.200
Yeah.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.600
Are you two happy?

07:29.900 --> 07:30.900
Very.

07:31.300 --> 07:32.500
I'm sorry to hear that.

07:33.097 --> 07:34.107
Excuse me?

07:34.108 --> 07:36.699
There won't be room for him and Patty.

07:36.700 --> 07:38.399
There won't be room for you and Patty.

07:38.400 --> 07:42.299
With Patty Hewes, there's only Patty.

07:42.300 --> 07:45.900
Oh, I came here for a favor.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.600
Could you autograph that for me, please?

07:48.900 --> 07:50.500
It'll clear my conscience.

07:52.900 --> 07:54.300
You're special, Ellen.

07:54.900 --> 07:57.000
But that'll only make the fall harder.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.499
What are you talking about?

08:00.500 --> 08:01.700
Your ambition.

08:02.400 --> 08:03.899
Maybe we need people like Patty

08:03.900 --> 08:06.999
who see their destiny
in grander terms than the rest of us.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.600
But that doesn't mean
that you should go work for her.

08:10.300 --> 08:12.600
So think about it.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.400
My offer's still good.

08:14.600 --> 08:16.199
My interview is on wednesday.

08:16.200 --> 08:17.870
I haven't even gotten the job yet.

08:17.871 --> 08:18.880
You will.

08:18.881 --> 08:21.297
Once Patty meets you,
there's no turning back.

08:21.500 --> 08:22.900
She'll see what I see.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.507
And she'll own you.

08:37.696 --> 08:39.855
I've invited you to the show a
hundred times before.

08:39.856 --> 08:41.809
You've never come, so why now?

08:42.282 --> 08:44.564
Well, actually, I
thought it wasDeal or No Deal.

08:44.796 --> 08:46.120
I mean, where's the bald guy?

08:46.121 --> 08:48.131
He's backstage.
We stuffed him in a briefcase.

08:49.122 --> 08:51.281
So what's the real story? Why now?

08:51.691 --> 08:54.260
I'm here because of Arthur Frobisher.

08:54.997 --> 08:58.323
5,000 of his employees lost
their life savings

08:58.324 --> 08:59.874
as a result of his actions.

09:00.005 --> 09:01.289
Alleged actions.

09:01.290 --> 09:03.687
He was found not guilty at a
criminal trial.

09:03.688 --> 09:05.375
No, it's a matter of public record.

09:05.376 --> 09:07.552
Arthur Frobisher told his employees

09:07.553 --> 09:09.179
to invest in the company

09:09.234 --> 09:10.928
and then sold his own stock.

09:10.929 --> 09:12.653
It's classic pump and dump.

09:12.654 --> 09:15.278
He claims he had a prior arrangement
with his broker to sell.

09:15.279 --> 09:16.395
You believe that?

09:16.785 --> 09:19.887
Arthur Frobisher made hundreds
of millions

09:19.888 --> 09:21.199
in personal profit

09:21.336 --> 09:24.301
while his workers lost their
pensions, their 401Ks,

09:24.302 --> 09:25.340
everything they had.

09:25.341 --> 09:26.803
Government couldn't prove it.

09:26.885 --> 09:29.725
Greta, I think there's
a lot of things our government can't do.

09:29.726 --> 09:30.999
We're gonna take a quick break.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.801
We'll be right back with high-stakes
litigator, Patty Hewes. And we're out.

09:35.331 --> 09:37.381
- That was great.
- It's good to meet you finally.

09:37.382 --> 09:38.413
- Nice to meet you.
- Tom

09:38.414 --> 09:40.053
confirmed the client
reps for tomorrow.

09:40.054 --> 09:41.133
Good.

09:41.134 --> 09:42.855
Wish my girlfriend could've been here.

09:42.856 --> 09:44.327
We're huge Greta fans.

09:44.440 --> 09:46.159
You have a girlfriend?

09:46.327 --> 09:48.240
She teaches at your son's school.

09:49.065 --> 09:50.405
I thought you were gay.

09:53.594 --> 09:55.814
Ms. Hewes, tell us what we can do.

09:55.815 --> 09:56.873
You're our lawyer.

09:57.025 --> 09:59.002
We're in the news every day.

09:59.003 --> 10:00.291
Look at this.

10:00.874 --> 10:04.565
Frobisher's lawyer called us
greedy in theWall Street Journal.

10:04.572 --> 10:07.155
On CNN, he said we're the bloodsuckers.

10:07.189 --> 10:09.602
I warned you the media war was coming.

10:10.176 --> 10:11.187
Well, here it is.

10:11.188 --> 10:13.567
I don't want my
grandkids hearing these lies.

10:13.568 --> 10:15.803
I know, Larry, it's deeply upsetting.

10:16.104 --> 10:18.154
And Frobisher's people are
spinning his case

10:18.155 --> 10:20.655
exactly the way we would expect them to.

10:20.656 --> 10:22.418
Well, what can we do about it?

10:22.419 --> 10:24.601
I need you to understand this.

10:24.602 --> 10:27.116
We are engaging in a battle

10:27.334 --> 10:29.274
with a man who will stop at nothing

10:29.275 --> 10:30.847
to preserve his fortune.

10:31.571 --> 10:35.323
High-stakes litigation is a long
and painful process.

10:35.679 --> 10:38.795
Frobisher will destroy us in the press,

10:38.904 --> 10:40.804
he will attack us personally,

10:40.886 --> 10:44.481
he will try to turn our lives upside down
so that we'll want to settle.

10:45.392 --> 10:48.781
Meanwhile, his attorneys will
spin him as the good guy,

10:48.782 --> 10:51.870
the aggrieved innocent victim.

10:52.968 --> 10:55.597
So we have to be patient,

10:55.827 --> 10:57.713
and we have to stay strong.

10:58.441 --> 11:01.360
But most of all, we have to all
stick together.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.322
If we do that,

11:05.206 --> 11:06.277
we'll win.

11:11.577 --> 11:13.657
Okay, enough already.

11:13.835 --> 11:16.100
- Sorry.
- Was I pushing it?

11:16.101 --> 11:18.843
No, it's good, I just haven't
exercised in, like, three months.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.356
The restaurant's killing me.

11:20.357 --> 11:22.064
I've never worked so hard in my life.

11:22.065 --> 11:23.421
Did you hire a staff yet?

11:23.422 --> 11:24.494
Starting to.

11:24.495 --> 11:25.858
Would you look over some contracts?

11:25.859 --> 11:26.892
- Yeah.
- Saffron.

11:28.053 --> 11:29.160
Good girl.

11:29.912 --> 11:31.221
Oh, nice work.

11:31.222 --> 11:33.023
You actually got my sister to
break a sweat.

11:33.024 --> 11:34.862
Yeah. Oh, you ass.

11:35.709 --> 11:37.002
Oh, my God.

11:37.732 --> 11:39.659
- What is it?
- They bumped up my interview.

11:45.923 --> 11:48.532
Ms. Hewes, we're ready for your
briefing in conference room one.

11:48.533 --> 11:49.655
Thank you, Felicia.

11:51.360 --> 11:53.575
I'm sorry, someone helping you?

11:53.588 --> 11:55.170
Uh, I'm Ellen Parsons.

11:55.420 --> 11:56.630
Who?

11:56.816 --> 12:00.039
I'm here for, um, to interview.

12:01.409 --> 12:02.822
Well, good luck to you.

12:04.826 --> 12:05.971
Ellen?

12:06.411 --> 12:07.470
Tom Shayes.

12:07.471 --> 12:08.722
We spoke on the phone.

12:08.803 --> 12:09.828
- Oh. Hello.
- Right.

12:11.113 --> 12:12.650
Right this way.

12:12.651 --> 12:13.676
Here you go.

12:14.332 --> 12:17.024
So, one of the advantages, you
know, you're not going to be

12:17.025 --> 12:19.402
buried in paperwork your first year.

12:20.619 --> 12:25.008
Unlike big firms, Patty believes
in a team approach,

12:25.009 --> 12:26.198
that kind of thing.

12:28.302 --> 12:29.614
Sorry, Tom.

12:29.723 --> 12:31.677
That's okay, it's all right.

12:31.678 --> 12:33.408
Ellen, Uncle Pete.

12:33.409 --> 12:35.649
Uncle Pete's been with Patty
longer than any of us.

12:35.650 --> 12:37.594
He's really the one who runs
everything around here.

12:37.595 --> 12:39.882
- Good to meet you, Ellen.
- Nice to meet you.

12:40.027 --> 12:41.093
It's dry cleaning.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.895
We've been working on the
Frobisher case 24/7.

12:44.087 --> 12:48.091
Some of our associates haven't,
haven't been able to go home yet.

12:50.838 --> 12:53.312
It's best not to go into an
interview with Patty cold.

12:53.313 --> 12:56.401
Most likely, she'll grill you on
precedents for our current case,

12:56.402 --> 12:58.793
but any topic is fair game...

12:58.794 --> 13:00.925
constitutional law, torts, contracts.

13:00.926 --> 13:01.938
No problem.

13:01.939 --> 13:04.986
Patty is not looking
to see how you handle the facts,

13:04.987 --> 13:07.826
she's looking to see how you
handle yourself, how you think,

13:07.827 --> 13:09.265
how you express yourself.

13:09.266 --> 13:10.266
Okay, got it.

13:10.781 --> 13:12.317
Yeah. No, you don't.

13:14.315 --> 13:17.992
when it comes to reading
people, Patty lives and dies by instinct.

13:18.132 --> 13:22.533
The woman has the sharpes
bullshit meter I've ever seen.

13:22.710 --> 13:24.733
And you're at the most difficult step.

13:24.734 --> 13:26.550
It's do or die.

13:26.783 --> 13:29.605
If you're phony with her for one second,

13:30.015 --> 13:32.038
she'll skewer you.

13:32.913 --> 13:34.976
Good. Phony's not my strong suit.

13:35.453 --> 13:36.453
Good.

13:37.806 --> 13:41.145
So we have you sitting down with
Patty Saturday.

13:42.266 --> 13:43.291
Come again?

13:43.292 --> 13:44.370
Exact time TBD.

13:44.371 --> 13:47.008
We're going to ask that you just
leave the whole day available.

13:47.009 --> 13:49.168
I thought the interview was today.

13:49.346 --> 13:50.643
No, no.

13:50.644 --> 13:53.586
We couldn't have you sit down with
Patty without you meeting me first.

13:53.587 --> 13:55.267
But I can't do Saturday.

13:56.469 --> 13:57.484
Work it out.

13:57.485 --> 13:59.308
Patty's schedule is impossible.

13:59.959 --> 14:02.297
My sister's getting married on Saturday.

14:03.062 --> 14:04.236
All day?

14:04.634 --> 14:06.137
You know, you didn't just think that.

14:06.138 --> 14:07.785
You actually said it.

14:08.997 --> 14:11.000
Look, Ellen,

14:11.219 --> 14:12.763
most people never get this chance.

14:12.764 --> 14:14.335
Do you want it or not?

14:27.954 --> 14:29.408
My dog's on a leash. Come on.

14:31.613 --> 14:35.126
Makes you long for the reasoned
justice of the courtroom, don't it?

14:37.818 --> 14:40.606
Ray, I didn't know you
walked your own dog.

14:40.832 --> 14:42.008
Which one is yours?

14:42.009 --> 14:43.798
Under the tree. The Doberman.

14:43.935 --> 14:44.946
Yours?

14:44.947 --> 14:47.980
He's that mutt over
there trying to hump the Ridgeback.

14:48.600 --> 14:49.844
Sorry.

14:51.087 --> 14:53.851
Hey, you know, I
caught you on TV last night.

14:55.015 --> 14:57.799
Seems foolish to get your
clients'hopes up when

14:57.800 --> 14:59.775
the government already spit the bit.

15:00.874 --> 15:03.034
Federal prosecutors proved
nothing against my client.

15:03.035 --> 15:04.311
Heaven knows, neither will you.

15:04.312 --> 15:06.081
I'm at a dog park, Ray.

15:07.270 --> 15:09.231
You're right, you're right.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.090
Let's not have this get

15:12.828 --> 15:15.398
pissy like last time.

15:18.555 --> 15:20.878
Give me a number, Patty.

15:21.509 --> 15:25.213
Mr. Frobisher's already lost three years
of his life to a government trial.

15:25.214 --> 15:28.370
Maybe I can talk him into saving
himself another three.

15:28.371 --> 15:30.513
A jury will give him a number, Ray.

15:31.623 --> 15:35.021
You in this for your
clients or to destroy Arthur Frobisher?

15:36.948 --> 15:38.145
Both.

15:40.951 --> 15:44.778
You are so full of shit, Patty.

15:47.211 --> 15:49.403
You know what I like most about you?

15:50.428 --> 15:51.999
You have no case.

15:56.271 --> 15:58.786
Come on! Nice seeing you, Ray.

16:03.462 --> 16:06.154
Aunt Barb and Uncle Fran all the way from

16:06.155 --> 16:07.480
California.

16:07.481 --> 16:10.114
And, Cathy and Rich, thank you so much,

16:10.115 --> 16:12.205
coming all the way from New Jersey.

16:12.889 --> 16:14.242
And I want to thank everyone...

16:14.243 --> 16:16.128
You know you actually
make that dress work?

16:19.093 --> 16:20.307
Thanks, babe.

16:22.329 --> 16:23.398
You okay?

16:25.049 --> 16:26.676
Yeah, it's...

16:27.017 --> 16:29.518
the one day of the year
I can't interview,

16:29.523 --> 16:31.417
and they won't reschedule.

16:32.729 --> 16:35.340
They're Hewes & Associates.

16:37.022 --> 16:39.055
I know, I know.

16:39.847 --> 16:42.666
I especially want to thank my sister,

16:43.305 --> 16:44.672
Ellen.

16:45.082 --> 16:48.309
And even though I've got three
years on her,

16:48.391 --> 16:50.264
Ellie's always

16:51.207 --> 16:52.765
been my big sister, you know?

16:52.766 --> 16:55.826
Always giving me advice, and...

16:57.288 --> 17:00.322
I swore to myself I was going
to make it through without crying.

17:00.828 --> 17:02.468
I love you, Carrie.

17:02.767 --> 17:04.448
Okay, here she goes again.

17:06.444 --> 17:08.999
I wish I could have been a
better role model, you know, but

17:09.627 --> 17:11.501
you were always

17:12.067 --> 17:14.241
perfect at everything, and...

17:15.279 --> 17:18.987
there wasn't ever anything
you need me for, so...

17:39.413 --> 17:42.133
Well, if it isn't the maid of honor.

17:42.735 --> 17:44.299
Thought you might need a breather.

17:44.353 --> 17:45.770
Ms. Hewes.

17:46.404 --> 17:48.194
What are you doing here?

17:48.195 --> 17:49.725
I had to meet you.

17:50.859 --> 17:52.083
Why?

17:52.513 --> 17:56.343
Because, kiddo, you're the first person
stupid enough to turn me down.

17:59.308 --> 18:01.550
I'm glad I'm not in your shoes.

18:02.028 --> 18:05.367
Family toasts, public displays
of affection...

18:05.368 --> 18:07.540
absolute torture.

18:08.169 --> 18:09.332
Bourbon?

18:11.531 --> 18:13.619
Helps take the edge off.

18:14.170 --> 18:16.439
I should probably just bite the bullet.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.243
So what about you, Ellen?

18:20.074 --> 18:22.326
Do you see a husband in your future?

18:22.740 --> 18:24.982
Yeah, I guess.

18:25.269 --> 18:26.499
I hope so.

18:26.827 --> 18:28.774
You know what they say.

18:28.775 --> 18:31.017
"Hope is the thing with feathers. "

18:31.330 --> 18:32.560
Emily Dickinson.

18:33.361 --> 18:35.353
That bitch will say anything.

18:36.928 --> 18:39.101
Ms. Hewes, I'm sorry I missed
our meeting today.

18:39.102 --> 18:41.055
No, no. I understand. I understand.

18:41.086 --> 18:42.086
The good sister.

18:42.087 --> 18:43.573
It's just that this is family, and

18:43.574 --> 18:45.498
if I skipped the wedding
for a job interview...

18:45.499 --> 18:47.603
You'd confirm their worst fear.

18:48.464 --> 18:49.844
Which is?

18:50.227 --> 18:53.430
They're good, hardworking people,
and they're afraid of losing you.

18:54.113 --> 18:56.300
Wait. How long have you been here?

18:56.301 --> 18:58.821
They actually remind me of my family.

18:58.999 --> 19:00.927
You love them, you do anything for them.

19:00.928 --> 19:04.015
The problem is, they don't have
your ambition.

19:05.437 --> 19:06.796
What's the problem?

19:06.954 --> 19:09.946
You try to lead by example,
and they want you to lead,

19:10.538 --> 19:12.178
and then they resent you for it.

19:12.179 --> 19:14.296
They put you on a pedestal, look
up to you,

19:14.297 --> 19:16.996
and then blame you for
the crick in their necks.

19:17.925 --> 19:19.373
Oh, that problem.

19:19.441 --> 19:22.079
I know how hard you
worked to get your shot with me,

19:22.476 --> 19:25.182
but you turned it down to be
with your family.

19:27.163 --> 19:29.364
That's an interesting choice.

19:35.217 --> 19:36.371
Ms. Hewes?

19:39.140 --> 19:41.853
Is there any way I could still
interview?

19:42.951 --> 19:45.151
I think it would be a
waste of time, Ellen.

19:47.311 --> 19:49.006
You're hired.

20:31.411 --> 20:34.391
I hate to interrupt your morning,
Art, but it's not good.

20:34.432 --> 20:36.113
<i>All right, how much does she want?</i>

20:36.114 --> 20:37.694
Say again? I can barely hear you.

20:40.492 --> 20:43.278
Yeah, I'm in the middle of a
storm here, Ray.

20:43.279 --> 20:44.673
How much does she want?

20:44.783 --> 20:47.161
She wouldn't give me a number.

20:47.960 --> 20:50.502
If she's got a pulse, she's got a price.

20:50.503 --> 20:52.101
Well, it's one you can't afford.

20:52.102 --> 20:55.244
She's on a mission here, and she
won't stop till you're strung up

20:55.245 --> 20:56.544
in the public square.

20:56.703 --> 20:58.165
All right, you know what?

20:58.166 --> 20:59.846
It's time you made the call, Ray.

20:59.847 --> 21:01.842
We're not there yet, Art.

21:02.107 --> 21:03.788
I'm sick of this shit

21:03.789 --> 21:06.685
First the government, now this bitch!

21:09.173 --> 21:10.229
Do you know something?

21:10.230 --> 21:11.746
My wife's about to leave me

21:11.747 --> 21:12.797
<i>because of this.</i>

21:12.798 --> 21:14.999
<i>My kids are getting harassed at school.</i>

21:15.000 --> 21:16.730
This bullshit never ends.

21:17.058 --> 21:18.562
Make the call.

21:19.464 --> 21:20.899
I want some leverage.

21:20.900 --> 21:22.600
Give me some time.
No. Time's up.

21:22.983 --> 21:26.044
Hey, Ray, what...
you called them "bloodsuckers"?

21:26.304 --> 21:27.435
What's that about?

21:27.503 --> 21:29.188
Come on.
Lighten up on the rhetoric.

21:31.141 --> 21:32.289
Art...

21:32.290 --> 21:33.888
Yeah, I can't hear you.

21:33.889 --> 21:37.496
Look, if you need me, I'm going
to be at the Brewster Trauma Center.

21:37.497 --> 21:40.765
My idiot brother-in-law can't drive.

21:42.475 --> 21:44.771
I'm going with you, so wait just
one second.

21:46.452 --> 21:49.786
Arthur Frobisher's dossier,
and his broker, Gary Genow.

21:49.787 --> 21:51.002
What do you know?

21:51.003 --> 21:53.299
The government lost
because they couldn't link these guys.

21:53.300 --> 21:55.993
Frobisher claimed he had a preexisting
agreement to sell his stock.

21:55.994 --> 21:58.209
Genow backs him up, but that's a crock.

21:58.673 --> 21:59.925
Very good. However,

22:00.034 --> 22:02.451
Frobisher and Genow
were both in Florida the weekend

22:02.452 --> 22:03.711
prior to the sell off.

22:03.712 --> 22:06.212
We don't have a
case unless we can connect

22:06.213 --> 22:08.366
Frobisher with his broker.

22:08.435 --> 22:11.442
Which the government couldn't do even
though both men were in Florida?

22:11.455 --> 22:13.464
We interviewed
every employee, colleague and

22:13.465 --> 22:17.082
golf buddy within 100 miles of
Arthur Frobisher on the day in question.

22:17.083 --> 22:19.254
And we managed to piece
together Frobisher's whereabouts.

22:19.255 --> 22:22.435
On Saturday, June 19, from 9:00
a. m. to 1:00 p. m.,

22:22.436 --> 22:24.991
he plays 18 holes in Palm Beach.

22:25.251 --> 22:28.292
We interviewed club
members, guests and employees,

22:28.471 --> 22:31.459
but no sign of his broker.

22:31.801 --> 22:35.258
From 1:00 p. m. to 3:00, he lunches
with a few of his fortune 500 pals...

22:35.259 --> 22:37.555
lobster bisque, Kobe beef.

22:37.746 --> 22:39.828
But his broker is nowhere to be found.

22:39.829 --> 22:42.138
From 3:00 p. m. to 6:00 p. m.,

22:42.139 --> 22:44.992
Frobisher's at the spa getting
a full body treatment.

22:44.993 --> 22:46.225
For three hours?

22:46.279 --> 22:47.974
What was he getting waxed?

22:49.556 --> 22:52.366
6:00 p. m., Frobisher flies home
in his private jet,

22:52.367 --> 22:54.758
arrives at Teterboro
Airport at 9:00 p. m.

22:54.759 --> 22:57.151
He's home safe and sound by 10:00.

22:57.219 --> 23:01.090
So somehow Frobisher and his broker
communicated down in Florida,

23:01.267 --> 23:02.832
but no one saw them together.

23:02.926 --> 23:05.661
So they probably used an intermediary.
Someone played messenger.

23:05.662 --> 23:08.783
Unfortunately, that could be anyone
in the entire state of Florida.

23:09.037 --> 23:12.418
Patty's got all her contacts in
the Sunshine State looking into it.

23:12.419 --> 23:14.017
Whatever happened,

23:14.332 --> 23:16.655
someone down there must know something.

23:17.738 --> 23:18.764
Ellen?

23:19.392 --> 23:21.524
You've got a 4:00 p. m. at Bergdorf's.

23:21.525 --> 23:23.847
Go to VIP Services.
Talk to Suzanne.

23:23.848 --> 23:25.760
She knows what Patty likes.

23:26.635 --> 23:27.772
First...

23:29.972 --> 23:31.678
your home away from home.

23:34.140 --> 23:36.068
Free piece of advice.

23:36.778 --> 23:38.933
Don't... don't make it your own.

23:39.711 --> 23:41.775
Patty doesn't want family photographs,

23:41.788 --> 23:43.974
tchotchkes, knickknacks.

23:43.975 --> 23:47.139
And don't bring anything you can't carry
out in one trip when she fires you.

23:47.578 --> 23:49.273
I'm kidding... sort of.

23:49.683 --> 23:51.582
Frobisher discovery.

23:51.664 --> 23:53.332
Patty will need a full summary.

23:53.539 --> 23:55.109
She wants to see how you write.

24:25.603 --> 24:27.433
Her name is Ellen Parsons.

24:27.898 --> 24:29.429
- You her lawyer?
- Is she okay?

24:29.430 --> 24:30.726
Are you her lawyer?

24:30.727 --> 24:31.751
No. A friend.

24:33.619 --> 24:35.257
You have a current address?

24:35.396 --> 24:36.927
Yes. Certainly.

24:40.891 --> 24:42.462
She lives with her fiancé.

25:20.853 --> 25:24.090
Okay, that was insane.

25:24.516 --> 25:25.717
There's more.

25:25.718 --> 25:26.839
Let me grab those.

25:27.359 --> 25:31.262
There were, like, five women
helping me try on a pair of pants.

25:31.494 --> 25:33.244
Oh! I'd enjoy that.

25:34.275 --> 25:36.407
At one point, I was half naked,

25:36.408 --> 25:39.285
and Barbara Walters walked
into the dressing room.

25:39.286 --> 25:41.696
That... not so much.

25:43.268 --> 25:46.910
They had everything
ready to go, pulled in my size.

25:47.475 --> 25:48.475
Nice.

25:50.422 --> 25:52.532
Can't wait for a reason to wear it.

25:56.903 --> 25:58.030
Oh, wait.

25:58.462 --> 25:59.528
This isn't mine.

25:59.965 --> 26:01.018
No?

26:02.261 --> 26:03.800
How did this get in here?

26:04.885 --> 26:05.960
I don't know.

26:19.733 --> 26:20.834
Baby.

27:34.445 --> 27:36.818
I hear we're a little
behind schedule for the opening.

27:36.819 --> 27:38.008
Frank...

27:38.855 --> 27:40.457
In the restaurant business,

27:40.458 --> 27:42.767
a little behind is a lot ahead.

27:42.768 --> 27:44.461
We're doing just fine.

27:44.487 --> 27:46.974
But you did say you
would call before you came.

27:46.975 --> 27:50.993
Oh, my boss wanted me
to check up on his investment.

27:51.252 --> 27:53.059
And good news...

27:53.476 --> 27:55.690
I was able to push this through.

27:58.847 --> 28:00.419
My liquor license!

28:00.961 --> 28:02.915
Oh, excellent. Thank you.

28:03.380 --> 28:04.898
Hey, there, fella.

28:07.221 --> 28:08.342
What's his name?

28:08.588 --> 28:09.652
Her.

28:09.777 --> 28:10.998
Saffron.

28:12.385 --> 28:13.997
Got one myself.

28:14.955 --> 28:17.589
Most loyal creatures on God's
green Earth.

28:19.438 --> 28:20.996
Oh, one more thing.

28:21.597 --> 28:23.887
I need your Jane Hancock...

28:25.268 --> 28:28.261
here and here.

28:31.131 --> 28:33.687
I think I've already
signed one of these.

28:33.726 --> 28:37.028
Oh, this just
clarifies the scope of your

28:37.029 --> 28:39.234
existing confidentiality agreement.

28:39.235 --> 28:41.161
I do hate housekeeping.

28:43.744 --> 28:45.434
It's standard boilerplate.

28:45.450 --> 28:47.945
Okay, I'll get my lawyer to take a look.

28:50.016 --> 28:51.628
There's some problem?

28:51.629 --> 28:53.296
No, no problem. I just...

28:53.678 --> 28:56.453
Permits are coming through,
you're getting everything you need?

28:56.521 --> 28:57.906
Yeah, absolutely.

28:57.907 --> 28:59.532
You guys have been great.

29:00.489 --> 29:02.174
Good. I'm glad to hear that.

29:02.512 --> 29:05.505
I'd hate for anything to hold up
your opening.

29:06.995 --> 29:08.057
Oh, so would I.

29:09.703 --> 29:10.728
I'm sorry.

29:10.837 --> 29:12.491
I'm going to have to get back to work.

29:12.614 --> 29:13.808
By all means.

29:15.470 --> 29:16.906
Good girl, Saffron.

29:19.227 --> 29:21.033
You be a good girl, too.

29:32.802 --> 29:36.588
My great-great
grandfather designed this.

29:38.413 --> 29:41.299
He grew rich on the munition
demands of the Civil War.

29:41.736 --> 29:45.003
In fact, he started this club
over a hundred years ago.

29:46.070 --> 29:48.994
I hear you know your way around
a rifle, Larry.

29:49.089 --> 29:51.960
The Marines was
a long time ago, Mr. Frobisher.

29:54.624 --> 29:57.618
These guns are all
that's left of my family's fortune.

29:57.987 --> 29:59.534
The Depression wiped us out.

29:59.535 --> 30:01.051
I didn't know that.

30:01.133 --> 30:02.309
Yeah.

30:02.678 --> 30:04.497
Sit down, come on.

30:09.751 --> 30:11.897
- That's good lemonade, isn't it?
- Yeah.

30:14.056 --> 30:16.120
I grew up with nothing.

30:16.121 --> 30:20.060
At 17, I walked out of my
father's house without a dime,

30:20.825 --> 30:23.777
bullheaded and full of pride.

30:25.199 --> 30:29.216
It took almost three decades,
but I built my company

30:29.954 --> 30:31.717
from the ground up.

30:34.941 --> 30:37.058
That company meant everything to me.

30:41.004 --> 30:44.651
But what happened to you... to
all my employees, is a tragedy.

30:48.252 --> 30:49.252
Yes, it is.

30:53.870 --> 30:56.070
But, Larry,

30:56.170 --> 30:58.170
Patty Hewes...

30:58.870 --> 31:00.169
she's not the answer.

31:00.170 --> 31:02.770
I mean, she's an egomaniac,

31:03.370 --> 31:05.570
and she's going to lose.

31:06.570 --> 31:07.769
You know why?

31:07.770 --> 31:09.169
No, sir.

31:09.170 --> 31:10.870
Because I didn't do it.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.969
I'm a very rich man.

31:13.970 --> 31:16.270
I make no apologies for that.

31:16.770 --> 31:18.369
But I'm also an innocent man,

31:18.370 --> 31:22.406
and I want to come to some
reasonable solution to this.

31:23.295 --> 31:24.970
What do you want from me?

31:26.270 --> 31:27.870
All right, um...

31:30.070 --> 31:32.469
I know that you have the employees'ear,

31:32.470 --> 31:34.070
that they trust you.

31:34.670 --> 31:37.680
I think that you and I together...

31:38.268 --> 31:39.443
could end this.

31:40.170 --> 31:42.269
Now, we'll... we'll be discreet.

31:42.270 --> 31:45.150
We'll take care of you
when this is all settled, but

31:45.519 --> 31:48.669
all I'm asking for is a number

31:48.670 --> 31:50.770
that you think is fair.

31:53.670 --> 31:55.270
That's all.

32:06.270 --> 32:09.170
Mr. Frobisher has a number for you.

32:20.743 --> 32:22.469
He wants to settle for $100 million?

32:22.470 --> 32:24.365
- That's ridiculous.
- That's total bullshit,

32:24.366 --> 32:26.169
but it's our duty
to take it to the clients.

32:26.170 --> 32:27.467
What if they accept?

32:27.604 --> 32:28.869
It's never going to happen.

32:28.870 --> 32:30.370
This is Patty Hewes.

32:30.470 --> 32:32.670
Watch and learn.

32:33.170 --> 32:36.770
Arthur Frobisher stole your future.

32:37.370 --> 32:39.935
He stole financial security

32:39.936 --> 32:42.832
from your children and
your children's children.

32:43.270 --> 32:46.509
Now, this offer...
it might pay for today's bills,

32:46.770 --> 32:49.369
but you've got to remember
there are 5,000 of you.

32:49.370 --> 32:52.369
There's going to be nothing
left for tomorrow.

32:52.370 --> 32:54.369
Frobisher wants this case settled

32:54.370 --> 32:56.069
before we can expose the truth.

32:56.070 --> 32:57.169
You want the truth?

32:57.170 --> 32:58.370
We're broke.

32:59.654 --> 33:01.088
- Exactly.
- $100 million.

33:01.089 --> 33:03.894
Mrs. Hewes, that's a one with
a hell of a lot of zeroes.

33:03.895 --> 33:04.929
Absolutely,

33:04.930 --> 33:08.770
but it's what Frobisher wants
to pay to get rid of you.

33:08.970 --> 33:11.069
If you want to send a message to this man,

33:11.070 --> 33:14.170
he has to pay a price
that he can't afford.

33:15.170 --> 33:20.170
Frobisher's net worth is upward
of two and a half billion dollars.

33:20.670 --> 33:24.169
now $100 million sounds like
a lot of money, and it is,

33:24.170 --> 33:27.845
but it's less than five percent
of what this man is worth.

33:28.270 --> 33:30.570
I think we have a strong case.

33:30.870 --> 33:33.569
I'd like to take it to a jury
and let them decide

33:33.570 --> 33:36.770
what Mr. Arthur Frobisher owes you.

33:37.770 --> 33:40.370
Now, hold on, hold on here, people.

33:41.770 --> 33:43.487
We discussed this,

33:43.488 --> 33:45.947
and we all agreed if Frobisher
ever offered

33:45.948 --> 33:48.680
$100 million we'd accept it.

33:49.172 --> 33:50.270
Do you know about this?

33:51.170 --> 33:52.170
Of course not.

33:54.792 --> 33:56.370
It's ridiculous.

33:57.370 --> 34:00.140
Mrs. Hewes, you work
the percentage, right?

34:00.141 --> 34:02.012
- Right.
- More money from

34:02.013 --> 34:04.670
Frobisher means more money for you.

34:04.870 --> 34:06.470
The rich get richer.

34:08.270 --> 34:09.670
You're absolutely right.

34:10.070 --> 34:11.670
I have made a lot of money.

34:11.770 --> 34:13.570
I'm good at what I do.

34:13.870 --> 34:16.869
But it also affords me the luxury
to only take cases

34:16.870 --> 34:18.902
that I feel passionately about.

34:18.904 --> 34:20.869
And I feel passionately about this case.

34:20.870 --> 34:22.569
If we turn this settlement down,

34:22.570 --> 34:25.974
the case could drag on for years
and we could end up getting nothing.

34:26.469 --> 34:30.170
You can survive that... we can't.

34:32.969 --> 34:35.170
Let's stick to our plan.

34:35.469 --> 34:38.370
Take this money and get on with our lives.

34:43.969 --> 34:45.569
Karen, Larry, if I may,

34:45.570 --> 34:46.969
I just want to say one thing...

34:46.969 --> 34:49.168
All due respect, Mrs. Hewes,

34:49.170 --> 34:51.070
I say we end this here and now.

34:51.170 --> 34:53.969
On behalf of custodial services,

34:53.969 --> 34:57.570
I vote to accept the settlement.

35:19.170 --> 35:22.661
I am pleased to present
the american bar association's

35:23.044 --> 35:26.242
national public service award

35:27.270 --> 35:31.270
to Patricia C. Hewes.

35:37.070 --> 35:38.670
Thank you, george.

35:39.570 --> 35:42.269
I'm particularly touched
to receive this award from you

35:42.270 --> 35:45.469
and thanks to the aba for
your recognition and support.

35:45.470 --> 35:48.070
I'm deeply honored and grateful.

35:48.270 --> 35:50.470
And all of you for coming
out this morning.

35:50.870 --> 35:51.870
I have to admit,

35:51.871 --> 35:55.069
I wouldn't want to give up
my saturday morning to listen to me,

35:55.070 --> 35:56.469
so I will...

35:56.470 --> 35:58.270
I will try to be brief.

35:59.870 --> 36:00.980
Look at her.

36:00.981 --> 36:02.429
Normally, she turns this shit down.

36:02.430 --> 36:03.870
She hates awards.

36:03.933 --> 36:05.437
Then why is she here?

36:05.438 --> 36:06.470
For the P.R.

36:06.471 --> 36:08.769
...Has just become another tool...

36:08.770 --> 36:10.969
Most cases you get
your clients $100 million,

36:10.970 --> 36:12.370
you're a hero.

36:12.970 --> 36:15.469
But if Frobisher gets off that easy,

36:15.470 --> 36:17.870
the whole legal world
will know she tanked it.

36:19.470 --> 36:21.669
The powerful corrupt the law

36:21.670 --> 36:25.670
when they use it as a club
to bludgeon the weak.

36:26.370 --> 36:30.370
Yes, ma'am, my produce is
100% locally grown, organic.

36:31.070 --> 36:33.872
And I was trained
at the culinary institute, yes.

36:35.225 --> 36:36.970
The culinary institute.

36:37.670 --> 36:39.169
Ma'am, can I...

36:39.170 --> 36:41.170
can I give you a call back?

37:02.994 --> 37:04.018
Hey, sis, what's up?

37:04.019 --> 37:05.370
David, where are you?

37:05.400 --> 37:06.548
I'm at Ellen'S.

37:06.549 --> 37:07.969
Just got off a shift. What's up?

37:07.970 --> 37:09.470
We need to talk.

37:17.870 --> 37:19.270
There you are.

37:19.670 --> 37:21.570
Is this the lawyer of the year?

37:21.870 --> 37:24.070
Is this the man who kidnapped my husband?

37:25.270 --> 37:26.370
How's london?

37:26.670 --> 37:28.569
London? Is that where i am?

37:28.570 --> 37:29.970
I've lost track.

37:30.270 --> 37:31.869
Michael's headmaster called.

37:31.971 --> 37:33.769
Yeah, I know.
We're on for monday morning.

37:33.770 --> 37:35.770
I'll have a talk with
Michael when I get home.

37:35.825 --> 37:37.670
Another talk's going to help?

37:37.848 --> 37:39.470
Probably not.

37:40.170 --> 37:41.770
Any headway with the witness?

37:42.597 --> 37:43.649
No.

37:43.912 --> 37:44.930
You eating?

37:44.964 --> 37:47.042
Yeah. More or less.

37:47.043 --> 37:48.070
Sleeping?

37:48.071 --> 37:51.270
Phil, stop it. I'm fine.

37:51.370 --> 37:52.569
No, you're not.

37:52.570 --> 37:54.170
I can hear it in your voice.

37:55.070 --> 37:57.270
Fly safe. I'll see you tomorrow.

37:57.370 --> 37:58.670
Bye.

38:03.045 --> 38:06.254
The clients want to know to know why
Patty hasn't accepted the settlement yet.

38:06.370 --> 38:08.070
What is she waiting for?

38:08.370 --> 38:09.570
I don't know.

38:15.170 --> 38:16.870
Why the long face?

38:16.999 --> 38:19.670
Lighten up. I just got a goddamn award.

38:22.370 --> 38:23.569
So who's hungry?

38:23.570 --> 38:26.770
I'm thinking steak.

38:27.070 --> 38:28.469
Ellen, do you eat meat?

38:28.470 --> 38:29.514
Sure.

38:29.515 --> 38:31.069
Attagirl.

38:31.070 --> 38:32.769
Tom here's a vegan.

38:32.770 --> 38:34.669
Only for health reasons.

38:34.670 --> 38:36.070
Health reasons...

38:36.870 --> 38:37.870
right.

38:40.470 --> 38:43.070
I know everything about you,
don't I, Tommy?

38:43.670 --> 38:46.822
Who's been with me
ten years come august?

38:46.823 --> 38:47.846
I have.

38:47.847 --> 38:52.069
And who did I trust to be
my client liaison on this case?

38:52.070 --> 38:53.170
You trusted me.

38:53.770 --> 38:57.770
But who let me get blindsided
by their intentions?

38:58.170 --> 38:59.369
How could I have possibly...?

38:59.370 --> 39:00.669
How could you have possibly

39:00.670 --> 39:03.970
made such a catastrophic screw up?

39:04.270 --> 39:05.970
I wish I could answer that.

39:08.470 --> 39:11.275
Enjoy your tofu, tom, you're fired.

39:11.385 --> 39:12.470
Are you serious?

39:13.612 --> 39:14.786
How about sushi?

39:14.787 --> 39:16.110
- Patty...
- Do you like fish?

39:16.111 --> 39:18.269
Your clients purposefully misled me.

39:18.270 --> 39:19.436
I know a great place.

39:19.437 --> 39:21.170
- Listen to me...
- No, you listen to me.

39:21.171 --> 39:22.269
Get out of the car!

39:22.477 --> 39:24.212
- Get out of the car!
- This is bullshit!

39:24.213 --> 39:26.170
Get out!

39:33.770 --> 39:34.870
Oh, jesus.

39:37.970 --> 39:40.369
Joe, you know the place
I'm thinking about.

39:40.370 --> 39:42.069
That cute little japanese place,

39:42.070 --> 39:44.170
second and what... in the 70s?

39:44.613 --> 39:46.769
You're my sister.
How do you know Arthur Frobisher?

39:46.770 --> 39:49.265
I catered a function
for him and some businessmen.

39:49.770 --> 39:50.770
When?

39:50.870 --> 39:51.870
A few years ago.

39:52.070 --> 39:55.363
Then a week after the event,
his lawyer called me and told me

39:55.364 --> 39:56.949
Frobisher was a huge fan and

39:56.970 --> 39:59.901
that he wanted to help
me open a restaurant.

40:00.204 --> 40:02.034
Katie, why the hell didn't
you tell me that you

40:02.035 --> 40:03.755
worked for Arthur Frobisher?

40:03.756 --> 40:05.615
I didn't know
anything about him at the time.

40:05.616 --> 40:08.171
But then the government tried him
and he was all over the news.

40:08.172 --> 40:10.633
Jesus, Katie, you didn't think
that you should mention it?

40:10.670 --> 40:12.570
By that time, I couldn't tell you.

40:14.170 --> 40:16.569
I'd already signed the original
confidentiality agreement.

40:16.570 --> 40:18.636
And now you've got some guy
who's waiting outside...

40:18.637 --> 40:19.881
He needs them signed today?

40:20.970 --> 40:21.970
Oh, okay.

40:21.971 --> 40:24.070
I'll bring them right over.

40:26.562 --> 40:27.655
What's wrong?

40:27.656 --> 40:29.295
So this function you catered,

40:29.470 --> 40:30.771
was that in florida?

40:30.970 --> 40:32.569
Yeah, palm beach.
How did you know?

40:32.671 --> 40:34.925
Katie, this whole case turns
on one weekend,

40:34.926 --> 40:35.992
and you were there.

40:36.170 --> 40:37.170
Turns how?

40:37.870 --> 40:39.969
Somehow Frobisher communicated
with his broker

40:39.970 --> 40:41.512
down in palm beach.

40:41.834 --> 40:44.485
You must have seen something
that they didn't want you to see.

40:44.486 --> 40:46.591
I never even spoke to Frobisher.

40:46.844 --> 40:49.167
I just cooked for the guy.
What could I possibly know?

40:49.577 --> 40:50.835
I'm not sure.

40:51.070 --> 40:52.817
The government never contacted you?

40:52.970 --> 40:53.970
No.

40:54.290 --> 40:57.508
So obviously I thought that their case
had absolutely nothing to do with me.

40:58.253 --> 41:01.054
I have to tell Patty you were
down there, she should interview you.

41:01.055 --> 41:02.135
She can't.

41:02.354 --> 41:04.349
Katie signed a confidentiality agreement.

41:04.705 --> 41:06.044
A judge can override that.

41:06.270 --> 41:07.469
Wait. You want me to

41:07.470 --> 41:08.970
be a witness against Frobisher?

41:09.770 --> 41:11.492
Yes, if you know something.

41:11.870 --> 41:13.091
He's my investor.

41:13.665 --> 41:14.969
He's the only reason I have this

41:14.970 --> 41:16.469
restaurant in the first place.

41:16.470 --> 41:18.270
If she goes to Patty,
she's going to be screwed.

41:18.271 --> 41:20.269
She will lose everything, won't she?

41:23.570 --> 41:24.570
What should I do?

41:27.370 --> 41:28.370
I don't know.

41:30.170 --> 41:31.170
shit!

41:32.970 --> 41:34.769
Andrew, yes, yes, I'm on my way.

41:34.770 --> 41:35.770
I'm on my way.

41:38.070 --> 41:39.070
I have to go.

41:39.870 --> 41:41.420
So are you going to tell Patty?

41:57.970 --> 41:59.249
Hi, I'm here to see ms. Hewes.

41:59.250 --> 42:00.848
Certainly. Lucia.

42:02.187 --> 42:03.513
Esta es la mujer.

42:04.270 --> 42:05.270
Are you Ellen?

42:05.593 --> 42:06.755
Yeah, I guess.

42:07.178 --> 42:08.887
Ms. Hewes had to go to Michael's school.

42:08.888 --> 42:09.970
She waits for you.

42:10.049 --> 42:11.069
Oh, okay.

42:11.070 --> 42:12.070
Goodbye, Ellen.

42:25.670 --> 42:26.770
You're staring at me.

42:30.209 --> 42:31.275
Sorry.

42:33.899 --> 42:35.580
What, Ellen? Speak.

42:37.270 --> 42:39.216
You think I shouldn't have fired tom?

42:40.370 --> 42:42.070
It's not for me to say.

42:44.270 --> 42:46.270
This moron always keeps me waiting.

42:48.070 --> 42:49.420
you might as well sit down.

42:56.870 --> 42:58.170
Is everything all right?

42:59.470 --> 43:01.070
He's threatening to expel my son.

43:02.670 --> 43:03.670
Oh.

43:03.870 --> 43:04.870
I'm sorry.

43:07.544 --> 43:10.373
Do yourself a favor, Ellen,
don't have kids.

43:12.342 --> 43:13.769
I read an interview once with a

43:13.770 --> 43:16.489
nobel prize winner... physicist,

43:16.490 --> 43:18.269
genius, married six times.

43:18.270 --> 43:19.570
He said, "don't have kids. "

43:20.270 --> 43:21.669
Ruins your ambition, keeps you

43:21.670 --> 43:23.070
from what you want in life.

43:23.870 --> 43:26.070
He said to have wives instead.

43:27.070 --> 43:28.170
You can leave wives.

43:29.170 --> 43:30.570
You can't leave your own kids.

43:32.170 --> 43:34.070
Thanks, I'll keep that in mind.

43:36.270 --> 43:37.369
My son came out of me

43:37.370 --> 43:39.669
perfectly healthy... ten fingers,

43:39.670 --> 43:42.817
ten toes, everything works.

43:43.970 --> 43:46.904
I've managed to keep him alive
for 17 years, but

43:48.070 --> 43:49.747
I am not agood mother.

43:51.970 --> 43:52.970
I'm sure you are.

43:56.770 --> 43:58.170
Kids are like clients.

43:59.070 --> 44:02.070
They want all of you, all the time.

44:06.970 --> 44:10.670
I mean, um, don't get me wrong,

44:12.470 --> 44:13.670
I love my son.

44:14.870 --> 44:16.769
Well, that's the main thing.

44:16.770 --> 44:17.770
No.

44:18.370 --> 44:19.970
Love's nothing, love's easy.

44:20.370 --> 44:21.870
They come out of you, you love them.

44:23.070 --> 44:24.970
What you do after that is the hard part.

44:37.070 --> 44:38.620
you know what I like about you?

44:39.670 --> 44:41.370
There's always something going on.

44:42.670 --> 44:44.270
I could see it at your sister's wedding.

44:46.970 --> 44:50.170
And you don't fall for bullshit.

45:36.470 --> 45:37.770
Patty knows about Katie.

45:38.970 --> 45:39.970
You told her?

45:40.370 --> 45:41.370
I didn't have to.

45:42.791 --> 45:44.734
I mean, think about it.

45:46.470 --> 45:48.169
My future sister-in-law is

45:48.170 --> 45:51.431
a potential witness in the biggest
case in Patty's career.

45:52.470 --> 45:54.970
I mean, that's a pretty
big coincidence, isn't it?

45:55.370 --> 45:57.682
You think Patty hired
you just to get to Katie?

46:43.370 --> 46:44.470
Keep your heels dow, megan.

46:45.870 --> 46:48.039
So, you want to know if

46:48.040 --> 46:50.719
Patty knew about your friend
before she hired you?

46:51.570 --> 46:53.526
I know I sound paranoid but

46:53.936 --> 46:55.570
you're the only one I can trust.

46:56.170 --> 46:58.870
No, you sound, you sound smart.

47:00.670 --> 47:01.670
What?

47:03.670 --> 47:04.969
Patty was right about you.

47:04.970 --> 47:07.469
You are a force to be reckoned with.

47:07.470 --> 47:10.342
In less than 2 weeks, you're already
starting to think like her.

47:11.969 --> 47:14.414
Did she only hire me
to deliver her witness?

47:15.170 --> 47:17.521
Personally, I try not to guess

47:17.522 --> 47:20.270
what Patty Hewes does or doesn't know.

47:22.070 --> 47:23.300
And what about you?

47:24.120 --> 47:25.170
Me? Of course not.

47:25.970 --> 47:28.420
Today is the first I'm hearing
about your friend.

47:30.475 --> 47:34.036
you know, Patty didn't even know
who you were until I briefed her.

47:34.495 --> 47:36.695
Then she read your resume,
met you at the wedding,

47:36.696 --> 47:38.267
and in ten years,

47:38.622 --> 47:41.170
I've never seen her more
excited about somebody's potential.

47:42.970 --> 47:45.170
That's the only reason
she hired you, Ellen.

47:46.870 --> 47:47.870
There's no way she...

47:47.967 --> 47:49.650
there's no way she knew about your friend.

47:49.651 --> 47:51.270
Daddy, look at me!

47:51.770 --> 47:54.022
Yeah, it's looking good,
looking good, megan!

47:55.270 --> 47:57.670
So... what are you going to do?

48:24.638 --> 48:25.670
Thank you.

48:26.470 --> 48:27.470
Here you go.

48:27.471 --> 48:28.492
Thanks, dad.

48:33.670 --> 48:34.931
Ray, make this quick.

48:34.932 --> 48:37.104
I got a meeting with
the chairman of the board.

48:37.570 --> 48:39.370
We're cooking up something big here.

48:40.398 --> 48:42.970
Patty Hewes has a new associate.

48:43.970 --> 48:44.970
So what?

48:45.353 --> 48:47.388
I thought they voted
to accept the settlement.

48:47.389 --> 48:49.187
I haven't gotten the call yet

48:49.870 --> 48:50.970
and I'm worried.

48:51.694 --> 48:53.725
The new associate's been
talking to Katie connor.

48:54.070 --> 48:55.070
Who?

48:55.805 --> 48:56.870
Our chef.

48:59.270 --> 49:02.670
Ray, whatever it takes... fix this.

49:20.473 --> 49:21.670
Saffron!

49:21.671 --> 49:23.165
It doesn't matter what tom said,

49:23.166 --> 49:24.369
I don't want Katie involved.

49:24.370 --> 49:25.370
David.

49:25.475 --> 49:26.570
Saffron?

49:27.280 --> 49:28.824
Have you heard of vanessa tutto?

49:29.166 --> 49:31.369
- Who?
- The whistleblower in that airlines case.

49:31.370 --> 49:33.050
Dateline did a whole thing on her.

49:33.051 --> 49:34.469
Her life turned to shit.

49:34.470 --> 49:35.470
Saffron?

49:35.780 --> 49:38.281
David,
if I don't tell Patty about Katie,

49:38.470 --> 49:40.140
the clients lose the case.

49:40.141 --> 49:42.769
I'm not sure that you can be totally
objective about this.

49:42.770 --> 49:45.687
- What is that supposed to mean?
- That you'll score points with Patty.

49:46.670 --> 49:48.670
I would never do any to hurt Katie.

49:51.070 --> 49:53.170
Then just keep her out of this!

50:27.939 --> 50:29.030
Did you call the er?

50:29.128 --> 50:31.753
Yeah, they're waiting for us.

50:33.379 --> 50:35.169
Enough of this Katie.

50:35.170 --> 50:37.252
- Just give these guys what they want.
- No!

50:38.870 --> 50:39.870
Call Patty.

50:45.470 --> 50:46.970
I want to nail Frobisher.

50:51.191 --> 50:52.870
You know what this means?

50:53.371 --> 50:55.305
They're going to keep coming
after her...

50:55.523 --> 50:58.229
personally, legally,
in whatever way they can.

50:58.230 --> 50:59.842
Katie understands.

51:00.020 --> 51:03.014
If Frobisher thought this would
shut her up, it's done the opposite.

51:03.015 --> 51:05.570
I want to be very clear with you, Ellen.

51:06.322 --> 51:07.670
This is a big step.

51:08.715 --> 51:09.970
What about the settlement?

51:10.870 --> 51:11.969
We'll depose Katie.

51:11.970 --> 51:14.920
If she knows something,
we'll get our clients to turn it down.

51:16.370 --> 51:17.370
Good.

51:17.570 --> 51:18.570
I'm glad.

51:19.570 --> 51:20.570
Ellen.

51:23.070 --> 51:24.370
I don't take this for granted.

51:26.170 --> 51:27.970
I know how hard it is for you.

51:29.670 --> 51:31.594
Well, if Katie can help the case, then

51:31.813 --> 51:33.481
we're doing the right thing.

51:34.055 --> 51:36.706
I'll do everything in
my power to protect her.

51:37.731 --> 51:38.770
Good.

52:16.770 --> 52:17.770
I'm worried.

52:19.270 --> 52:20.270
I know.

52:22.570 --> 52:23.770
But we're in good hands.

52:25.070 --> 52:26.470
Patty knows what she's doing.

52:38.270 --> 52:39.770
You find this place okay, uncle Pete?

52:40.170 --> 52:43.002
Hey! I miss seeing
you around the offic, Tommy.

52:43.576 --> 52:45.869
Everyone thinks you were actually canned.

52:45.870 --> 52:46.870
Yeah, so did I.

52:47.608 --> 52:48.630
What's this?

52:48.631 --> 52:50.170
A souvenir for Patty.

52:51.515 --> 52:52.770
I'll get it to he, uncle Pete.

52:52.771 --> 52:53.830
Yeah.

53:12.345 --> 53:14.914
Maybe one of these days
I'll stop being impressed.

53:16.267 --> 53:17.853
Ellen figures out

53:17.854 --> 53:20.750
why you hired her, and you still
get her to deliver the witness.

53:22.500 --> 53:23.670
From uncle Pete.

53:26.022 --> 53:27.870
Are you interviewing for a new associate?

53:29.070 --> 53:30.270
No, I like Ellen.

53:31.636 --> 53:33.770
I think she's going
to have a brilliant future.

54:27.270 --> 54:28.270
Ellen.

54:31.570 --> 54:32.870
You'd better start talking.

54:42.370 --> 54:43.576
Get me a lawyer.
