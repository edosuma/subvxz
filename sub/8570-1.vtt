WEBVTT

01:23.417 --> 01:29.048
CLEAN HANDS

01:57.868 --> 02:01.205
Damn...

02:05.459 --> 02:06.669
You okay, Mom?

02:06.836 --> 02:10.131
Yeah, I was just...

02:11.757 --> 02:13.175
Dammit.

02:13.342 --> 02:15.803
Eddie Kronenburg.
Now everything's all wet.

02:15.970 --> 02:18.347
What are you gonna do about it?
- What was the deal?

02:18.514 --> 02:21.725
Oh no.
- Hypocrite! You weren't going to get me wet.

02:24.937 --> 02:28.023
Come on then.
- I'm not swimming.

02:28.190 --> 02:31.068
I'm not swimming.
- You don't need to.

02:31.235 --> 02:33.737
I won't go in the sea.

02:35.906 --> 02:39.410
I don't want to get wet.
- No, you'll have to get your hair done again.

02:44.039 --> 02:45.791
You've been eating herring?

02:45.958 --> 02:47.918
Fried fish. Why?

02:56.343 --> 02:58.179
All right already.

02:58.345 --> 02:59.722
Just go.

03:04.143 --> 03:07.521
Come and swim, Mom.
- In a minute. Go.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.357
Feels chilly.

03:32.963 --> 03:35.007
No barbecue again, I suppose?

03:36.217 --> 03:37.551
We'll see.

03:51.982 --> 03:55.027
Locked in the bathroom?
Shaving your legs?

03:55.319 --> 03:58.656
I'm here now, baby.
- I'm not your baby, honey.

03:59.865 --> 04:01.659
Focus on the grill.

04:01.825 --> 04:06.580
I got a text, Dad.
- What do I care? Put your phone away.

04:07.164 --> 04:10.459
More lemonade, Charlie?
- Focus on the grill, not the girls.

04:10.793 --> 04:13.254
Watch his hands. He's only got two.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.589
I don't care for burnt fingers.

04:16.298 --> 04:18.884
Is that hamburger ready yet?
- Almost

04:19.051 --> 04:23.055
Ignore your uncle. He's just here because
he has nowhere else to go.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.642
They're here, Daphne. Get the door.

04:26.850 --> 04:29.937
I got it for 8000 off that dick
from the deli.

04:30.104 --> 04:32.523
Watch your mouth
- Sorry, Syl.

04:36.068 --> 04:38.946
Sweetie, where were you?
We're ready to eat.

04:39.113 --> 04:40.864
Sorry.
- You're late.

04:41.407 --> 04:43.993
Gijs isn't here.
- He isn't?

04:44.243 --> 04:48.414
I can't reach him. He doesn't pick up.
I called and texted him.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.124
Nothing at all?
- No.

04:50.291 --> 04:54.169
Have a drink, he'll come.
- I want to know where he is.

04:54.336 --> 04:57.131
Doesn't Eddie know anything?
- Eddie.

04:57.423 --> 04:59.717
Any idea where Gijs is?

04:59.883 --> 05:02.344
Hey, gorgeous. You have a drink?

05:02.594 --> 05:06.640
I don't want a drink. I want my husband.
- We'll look for him.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.851
Look for him?
- You spoke to him?

05:09.018 --> 05:10.853
I haven't. We'll find him.

05:11.020 --> 05:14.106
Look where?
- He can't be far. We'll find him.

05:14.273 --> 05:17.318
Eddie, you call him.
- Charlie will help.

05:17.484 --> 05:20.738
Nah.
- Listen, honey. No one touches him.

05:20.904 --> 05:23.991
Go on.
- Come on, babe. To the Lexington.

05:24.158 --> 05:27.077
You came by car?
- No, moped, okay!

05:27.328 --> 05:29.455
Call when you find him.

05:30.581 --> 05:31.874
I don't know, Syl.

05:32.041 --> 05:35.336
He might just be with his whore.
- What? Gijs?

05:36.420 --> 05:38.088
Dammit.

06:01.487 --> 06:06.200
Police. We spent all day on the beach
yesterday. We're in this together.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.655
Who's there?
- Your mother, Kronenburg!

06:46.782 --> 06:50.119
You need a shave, mom.
- Amsterdam CID.

06:50.285 --> 06:53.580
Quit stalling and open the door,
or I will.

07:01.296 --> 07:03.090
Mom...

07:03.257 --> 07:04.508
Mom, what's up?

07:08.512 --> 07:12.099
Bad mood, Brandsma?
- New pied a terre, Kronenburg?

07:12.266 --> 07:14.351
Just a rental, kind of like yours?

07:14.518 --> 07:17.729
No idea. I'll have to look inside first.
- Here.

07:20.190 --> 07:21.942
Let me study this.

07:24.653 --> 07:25.946
Mom.

07:28.282 --> 07:31.827
It looks fake.
-Seriously Kronenburg?

07:32.870 --> 07:34.079
Mom.

07:34.997 --> 07:38.459
Can you hear me?
- I'm coming, honey. One second.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.714
Mom, Mom!

07:43.922 --> 07:47.301
Stay upstairs with your brother. No worries.

07:50.804 --> 07:55.476
You know what? Come inside.
Better than chasing bad guys in this heat.

07:56.602 --> 08:02.816
Living room, upstairs... You the kitchen.
- Keep the woman and children in the hall.

08:07.779 --> 08:09.323
Come with me.

08:13.410 --> 08:15.746
What's going on?
- Nothing.

08:15.913 --> 08:18.081
It's a mistake.
- But not mine.

08:18.332 --> 08:21.043
And that's mine. Hand over.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.713
Look. Hairdressers' reunion tonight?

08:25.589 --> 08:27.466
Right up my street.

08:28.258 --> 08:32.721
I'm glad my tax money is put to good use.
- I didn't know you even paid taxes.

08:32.888 --> 08:34.932
Is there anything you do know?

08:37.351 --> 08:39.352
It's a late Rembrandt.

08:39.770 --> 08:42.231
We want to see your car. Keys please?

08:42.397 --> 08:45.817
Hands off. You can touch anything except me.

09:01.291 --> 09:05.337
They're looking for Al-Qaeda garden gnomes.
Could explode any minute.

09:08.257 --> 09:09.758
Move on.

09:11.635 --> 09:13.637
Slept in on both sides.

09:13.845 --> 09:16.848
That's hot.
- But we did find blood.

09:18.350 --> 09:21.395
That's mine. That time of the month.

09:24.398 --> 09:27.359
Poke your nose into that.

09:31.655 --> 09:33.532
Where were you yesterday?

09:34.992 --> 09:37.703
On the beach.
- And your husband?

09:37.995 --> 09:40.289
With us.
- All day?

09:41.999 --> 09:44.501
Until our barbecue.

09:47.421 --> 09:50.882
And until then you were all on the beach?

09:52.676 --> 09:54.886
The children will confirm that?

09:55.721 --> 09:59.433
If you were allowed to interrogate them...
- Do you know Gijs Teerlink?

10:02.227 --> 10:04.396
When did you last see him?

10:05.981 --> 10:08.567
No idea. Ask my husband.

10:08.817 --> 10:10.027
Or Mr. Teerlink himself.

10:11.069 --> 10:13.780
Mr. Teerlink can't say much anymore.

10:24.082 --> 10:27.377
How come?
- Run over by a van.

10:27.878 --> 10:28.879
Terrible, isn't it?

10:29.755 --> 10:32.883
We filed it as 'a suspicious accident'.

10:34.426 --> 10:39.973
Is there someone to look after the kids,
'cos if you're lying, you'll go to jail.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.686
I'll ask you one more time.

10:45.103 --> 10:46.897
Where was he yesterday?

10:53.654 --> 10:54.946
On the beach.

10:55.781 --> 10:56.990
Then here.

10:57.741 --> 10:59.451
Together.

10:59.868 --> 11:01.244
Brandsma...

11:02.788 --> 11:05.540
And William the Silent?

11:05.707 --> 11:09.544
You have permission to interrogate her?
- interrogate her?

11:09.711 --> 11:13.507
We're just chatting.
ls there any coffee?

11:14.257 --> 11:16.134
You look like you drink tea.

11:16.760 --> 11:19.346
Used to.
- I can tell.

11:19.513 --> 11:21.056
Tea?

11:27.562 --> 11:29.439
You know the way.
- Thanks.

11:32.150 --> 11:35.028
That was fun.
- It was?

11:35.445 --> 11:38.657
Not your thing?
- The wife's our way in.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.325
Pervert.

11:40.992 --> 11:44.621
Sirens on. Let the neighbors know
who lives here.

11:53.588 --> 11:57.134
Hey, police guys! You forgot something.

11:59.261 --> 12:01.596
They're crazy.

12:02.556 --> 12:04.433
Off to school.

12:24.536 --> 12:26.455
Dad?
- Hey buddy

12:29.750 --> 12:32.586
I'm starving.
Can you get me something?

12:34.546 --> 12:35.797
Get dressed.

12:40.510 --> 12:41.928
What's with Gijs?

12:42.888 --> 12:44.639
They said an accident.

12:44.806 --> 12:48.226
Under suspicious circumstances.
- That doesn't mean anything.

12:48.393 --> 12:51.730
They asked when I last saw him.
- They're just fucking with us.

12:51.897 --> 12:54.900
I found blood in the toilet, Eddie.
I had to unclog it.

12:55.066 --> 12:57.360
I lied to the cops for you.

12:57.527 --> 12:59.488
It was my blood. Here.

13:00.113 --> 13:03.408
I wiped it with toilet paper
before the barbecue.

13:03.575 --> 13:06.787
How did you get that?
- On that fucking door in the warehouse.

13:06.953 --> 13:10.123
Maybe the guys know
what happened to Gijs.

13:14.169 --> 13:16.713
Baby, Gijs was my friend.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.841
It's hard for me too.
But it is what it is.

13:21.635 --> 13:25.263
We had a deal.
We'd grow big by staying small.

13:25.430 --> 13:29.684
The deal was: I keep my business out of
our home and you stay out of it.

13:29.851 --> 13:32.979
But you didn't do that, did you?

13:33.146 --> 13:37.776
It's a disgusting business.
- But when you go to Luis Vuiton, it isn't.

13:37.943 --> 13:40.779
When things go wrong,
it's suddenly disgusting.

13:40.946 --> 13:45.408
Take a look in your closet. Where do you
think it all comes from? Salvation army?

13:45.575 --> 13:49.496
I don't want to end up like Ineke,
without a husband.

13:49.663 --> 13:51.248
That won't happen.

13:52.123 --> 13:54.668
I've got everything under control.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.670
I can tell.

13:58.296 --> 14:02.717
I don't ever want the kids going
through this again. Understand?

14:07.597 --> 14:09.558
Are we ever going to open our beach bar?

14:11.101 --> 14:15.730
That's a bit delicate right now.
- It's been 'delicate' for two years now.

14:17.023 --> 14:19.442
I have to go. Make money.

14:19.609 --> 14:22.821
Go play beach bar in your $80.000 kitchen.

14:31.621 --> 14:34.207
Yuri, Daphne... come on.

14:44.509 --> 14:46.261
Well...

14:46.845 --> 14:48.889
Say you went to the dentist.

14:52.601 --> 14:53.768
Sweetheart...

14:54.477 --> 14:56.605
The invitations for your party.

14:59.107 --> 15:01.401
Did you hear me, Yuri?

15:01.610 --> 15:03.778
No cavities.
- Very good.

15:31.431 --> 15:35.060
Guys. All had visitors today?
- Yep.

15:35.268 --> 15:40.273
And William the Silent?
- They don't want a visit from Disselhoek.

15:40.899 --> 15:42.901
Why did you get red ones?
- They were out of pink.

15:43.068 --> 15:46.112
What did Disselhoek say?
- They're just trying to scare us.

15:46.279 --> 15:51.034
Our mole says they have nothing.
- Losers.

15:51.201 --> 15:54.537
Can we have a moment for Gijs?
Come on.

16:08.718 --> 16:09.761
Mitchell!

16:15.016 --> 16:16.434
Mitchell!

16:18.144 --> 16:20.480
Darling , how are you holding up?

16:22.315 --> 16:24.192
Why is he running off?

16:25.735 --> 16:27.237
What happened?

16:27.404 --> 16:29.197
Eddie said an accident.

16:30.365 --> 16:32.325
I have to...

16:32.492 --> 16:34.494
I have to go to Gijs.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.205
I have to...

16:38.456 --> 16:40.959
I have to bring him clean clothes.

16:45.964 --> 16:47.048
Baby!

16:55.849 --> 16:57.726
What have they done to you?

17:20.790 --> 17:22.666
Sorry I'm late.

17:26.087 --> 17:28.173
Mrs. Kronenburg?
- Yes.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.342
Can I have a word?
- Certainly.

17:32.093 --> 17:35.472
Is everything alright at home?
- Yes. Why?

17:35.638 --> 17:38.683
Daphne was involved in a fight today.

17:40.018 --> 17:43.813
The other parents filed a complaint.

17:43.980 --> 17:46.316
It can't just be her fault. Can it?

17:46.608 --> 17:50.153
She tore the other kids' clothes.
- They deserved it.

17:50.320 --> 17:53.490
Zip it.
- You know what they said to me?

17:54.365 --> 17:57.494
There are rules all students have to follow.

17:57.660 --> 18:01.664
If not we'll have to suspend her.
- Fine.

18:03.083 --> 18:04.125
Yes.

18:07.545 --> 18:09.380
Thanks!

18:09.589 --> 18:11.424
What did I tell you?

18:12.008 --> 18:13.093
Clothes!

18:20.892 --> 18:26.689
The Intensive Car Care garage decided
they wanted to work with us after all.

18:26.856 --> 18:32.112
I told you to be more convincing.
- Can you drop me at Social Services.

18:32.278 --> 18:35.907
They're bothering me about my benefits.
- Sure.

18:39.661 --> 18:40.578
Disselhoek - Lawyers

18:40.745 --> 18:42.413
Yes?
- It's Eddie.

18:53.091 --> 18:55.677
Kronenburg!
-June.

18:57.428 --> 18:58.972
How much?
- 16...

18:59.139 --> 19:00.682
ls William the Silent in?
-No.

19:00.849 --> 19:02.517
Give him my best.

19:06.187 --> 19:09.149
It's hot again. A heat wave.

19:09.315 --> 19:13.778
People sometimes wonder how
to define a national heat wave.

19:13.945 --> 19:18.408
That is when for five days at least...

19:18.575 --> 19:21.035
Make yourself useful.

19:22.453 --> 19:23.496
Daphne.

19:24.747 --> 19:25.957
Yuri.

19:26.166 --> 19:28.543
Wash your hands, pee and come to dinner.

19:29.794 --> 19:31.212
Yuri.

19:33.882 --> 19:37.427
Do I really have to come upstairs
to get you to...

19:38.595 --> 19:39.888
Jesus.

19:40.722 --> 19:41.973
Yuri.

19:43.474 --> 19:44.976
Sweetheart...

19:47.312 --> 19:48.354
Sweetie.

19:49.439 --> 19:52.692
Please put that down.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.904
Give it to me.

19:59.073 --> 20:03.286
You can never ever touch this again.

20:03.453 --> 20:04.621
Understand?

20:07.916 --> 20:09.000
Oh, baby.

20:10.710 --> 20:13.004
Do you have any idea what could happen?

20:13.421 --> 20:16.216
I didn't shoot it.
- That's beside the point.

20:22.805 --> 20:24.307
Where did you find it?

20:27.060 --> 20:28.228
In Dad's shed?

20:36.486 --> 20:37.862
Come on, kids.

20:40.281 --> 20:42.408
Hello Grandma.
- Hello sweetie.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.912
Hello Granny.
- Hi sweetheart.

20:48.414 --> 20:49.791
What are you doing here?

20:49.958 --> 20:51.334
Not now.

20:56.506 --> 20:59.133
This is my final offer.

20:59.968 --> 21:03.680
I can't do it for less.

21:04.097 --> 21:05.348
ASSHOLE

21:11.688 --> 21:13.731
Sylvia? Sylvia?

21:18.820 --> 21:22.490
Ineke, is Sylvia with you?

21:23.616 --> 21:25.493
What kind of reunion?

21:25.660 --> 21:29.998
My hairdressing school.
- Why aren't you a hairdresser then?

21:30.164 --> 21:33.668
I was going to start a business
with Chantal.

21:33.835 --> 21:36.045
So... look...

21:36.212 --> 21:37.714
Her.

21:38.923 --> 21:40.758
She was my buddy.

21:42.427 --> 21:44.679
But then I met your father.

21:47.724 --> 21:49.517
When are we going home?

21:50.601 --> 21:52.186
We only just got here.

21:53.479 --> 21:56.566
Worried about what your friends might think?
- What friends?

21:56.733 --> 21:59.193
Ballet. School. It can't be all that bad.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.697
And what about my party?

22:02.864 --> 22:05.116
Your party will go ahead as planned.

22:08.453 --> 22:10.163
Will dad go to jail?

22:13.624 --> 22:15.835
Of course not, baby. Don't be silly.

22:17.211 --> 22:18.963
Sleep tight.

22:19.797 --> 22:21.132
Don't you worry.

22:32.018 --> 22:33.811
He's already rung twice.

22:35.438 --> 22:37.106
Ignore it.

22:38.274 --> 22:40.360
What did you fight about?

22:41.152 --> 22:43.029
Things...

22:43.196 --> 22:45.615
His work...
- Oh, his work.

22:45.782 --> 22:48.785
So now your complaining about
a husband who works hard.

22:48.951 --> 22:51.120
Mom...

22:51.287 --> 22:54.791
And are you thinking of the kids?
- All the time.

22:54.957 --> 22:59.253
Eddie has to realize this is serious.
- Don't be so stubborn.

23:00.463 --> 23:04.092
At least you can talk to Eddie.
- You don't know him the way I do.

23:06.052 --> 23:08.888
He's a good guy and a good father.

23:09.055 --> 23:11.516
And he always looks impeccable.

23:11.682 --> 23:15.478
Sure, because he pays your rent.
- You watch your mouth!

23:15.686 --> 23:18.981
Everyone has their faults. So do you.
- Nice.

23:19.816 --> 23:21.984
Call me if there's anything.

23:23.653 --> 23:25.405
You look gorgeous, honey.

23:34.831 --> 23:39.794
Is Eddie still in shipping?
- Nets, cables, ropes.

23:39.961 --> 23:42.171
Things like that. Steady.

23:44.966 --> 23:46.050
And you?

23:46.551 --> 23:48.469
Fine.

23:48.636 --> 23:51.431
Just moved. It's lovely.

23:51.597 --> 23:56.394
The kids are doing well.
Daphne is rebellious, but adorable.

23:56.561 --> 23:59.689
And Yuri is...
- I was asking about you.

24:02.066 --> 24:04.694
You looked a bit stressed out
when you came in.

24:05.278 --> 24:08.364
Yes, well...

24:09.157 --> 24:12.034
a friend of ours has died.

24:13.995 --> 24:16.080
He was ill.

24:17.248 --> 24:18.499
Cancer.

24:19.709 --> 24:25.673
High temperatures in the south.
Up to 30 around the Mediterranean.

24:25.840 --> 24:29.135
But not in Greece and Turkey.

24:29.594 --> 24:33.097
So it's important to get enough to drink.

24:33.264 --> 24:37.059
What did you do this time?
- Nothing. Tomorrow she'll have forgotten.

24:37.226 --> 24:39.228
That's what you always say.

24:40.146 --> 24:41.564
Is this about Gijs?

24:44.734 --> 24:47.361
This is Teun Maaswinkel, I'm not able...

24:47.528 --> 24:51.115
Did you get the time right?
- I always do.

24:51.282 --> 24:54.076
Especially when people are coming to pay me.

24:54.243 --> 24:56.871
This dick is fucking with me.

25:00.958 --> 25:02.752
Should I pay him a visit?

25:02.919 --> 25:04.504
No. I'll do it myself.

25:04.754 --> 25:07.757
He has to realize who he's dealing with.

25:08.382 --> 25:12.303
I'll stuff his planner up his ass.
We'll see if he's late next time.

25:15.389 --> 25:18.017
Hey Mom.
- Hi Eddie, you have a moment?

25:28.194 --> 25:29.987
Goddammit.

25:39.205 --> 25:41.123
What's all this?
- Mom.

25:45.878 --> 25:47.588
Things can't go on like this.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.925
The kids need a normal life.

25:51.634 --> 25:53.010
Sorry, baby.

25:56.847 --> 26:00.726
If someone apologizes,
the least you can do is listen.

26:02.228 --> 26:05.314
Guess what your son had
his hands on yesterday?

26:05.481 --> 26:07.066
His dick?

26:07.233 --> 26:08.985
You think this is funny?

26:10.987 --> 26:12.154
A gun.

26:12.822 --> 26:14.949
Fuck.
- You can say that again.

26:16.951 --> 26:20.621
And where did he get that piece?
Mister 'everything's under control'?

26:21.205 --> 26:26.210
You thought: I'll just leave it at home?
- I'll set him straight.

26:26.377 --> 26:29.672
But he isn't the problem. You are.

26:31.215 --> 26:32.550
I just forgot.

26:32.717 --> 26:35.970
Okay? Because of the fucking cops.

26:36.137 --> 26:37.847
Are you done with it now?

26:40.391 --> 26:42.101
Open it.

26:42.852 --> 26:44.353
Syl, open it.

26:46.355 --> 26:47.690
My name is Sylvia.

26:48.524 --> 26:51.319
What's all this? I always call you Syl.

26:52.111 --> 26:53.279
Come on, open it.

27:02.204 --> 27:04.832
It's on the market.
BEACH PAVILION

27:07.251 --> 27:10.796
When I retire,
we somehow have to pay our bills.

27:11.339 --> 27:12.381
Really?

27:15.968 --> 27:17.762
My own beach club?

27:19.430 --> 27:21.432
Are you really done with it?

27:24.435 --> 27:26.896
I'm arranging things to prepare it.

27:29.482 --> 27:33.944
I have to be careful.
Especially now with that Gijs hassle.

27:35.863 --> 27:40.618
Investments have been made.
- I don't care about the money.

27:40.785 --> 27:42.286
Or the stuff.

27:43.537 --> 27:46.582
It's not like quitting a rock band.

27:47.416 --> 27:49.585
I can't just dump people.

27:50.378 --> 27:54.382
I have deals with Charlie, Daan
and William the Silent.

27:54.548 --> 27:56.384
It'll be alright.

27:57.343 --> 27:58.844
I promise.

28:11.023 --> 28:13.484
Is that a little mouse?

28:14.777 --> 28:16.987
Did you bring a lot of bags?

28:17.571 --> 28:18.698
Hey...

28:20.116 --> 28:22.034
I'm serious.

28:22.910 --> 28:24.412
Or I'm out the door.

28:25.329 --> 28:27.832
And then I won't be at my mother's.

28:49.645 --> 28:51.480
I made a down payment today.

28:56.193 --> 28:58.279
At last.

28:59.196 --> 29:00.865
Seriously?

29:01.031 --> 29:02.450
Seriously.

29:11.542 --> 29:13.961
I hope Ineke still wants to be a part of this.

29:15.796 --> 29:17.965
Come on, let's take a look inside.

29:58.214 --> 30:00.758
Charlie didn't come.

30:00.925 --> 30:02.635
Daan didn't come.

30:03.344 --> 30:05.429
They all had important meetings
all of a sudden.

30:05.596 --> 30:09.016
Even his own brother...
- I'm so sorry about Eddie.

30:09.183 --> 30:10.893
Get lost, woman.

30:11.060 --> 30:14.605
He's just bitching all day.
He wants to know who...

30:16.065 --> 30:17.858
He wants revenge.

30:19.360 --> 30:21.028
My condolences.

30:21.195 --> 30:24.824
Classy, guys.
You'll want to check the coffin next?

30:24.990 --> 30:27.117
Never mind, Sylvia.

30:28.369 --> 30:29.870
This way, please?

30:31.622 --> 30:36.043
Where was Eddie really on Sunday afternoon?
- So long ago.

30:36.210 --> 30:39.547
The afternoon when
Gijs Teerling was murdered.

30:39.713 --> 30:41.215
Didn't I tell you?

30:41.674 --> 30:44.969
Apparently he was already somewhat dead
when the van ran him over.

30:46.971 --> 30:49.014
You have no right to bother me like this.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.561
You think this is bad?

30:55.229 --> 30:56.689
Better buckle up.

31:16.333 --> 31:18.878
He said Gijs was going to squeal.

31:19.503 --> 31:21.088
About the guys.

31:21.672 --> 31:23.674
About William the Silent.

31:24.341 --> 31:25.551
He's full of shit.

31:26.886 --> 31:28.679
Gijs would never do that.

31:29.346 --> 31:32.099
That cop just said it to...

31:32.266 --> 31:34.018
to stir things up.

31:34.184 --> 31:36.020
Where was Eddie Sunday?

31:37.396 --> 31:39.315
Shut up, Mitchell.

31:42.484 --> 31:45.029
Eddie was on the beach, with me.

31:46.363 --> 31:49.116
We were on the beach, together, all day.

31:50.200 --> 31:53.454
If Eddie knew anything, he'd say so.

31:53.621 --> 31:55.205
Right, Sylvia?

32:11.805 --> 32:13.933
I'm so sorry, Ineke.

32:16.226 --> 32:17.478
Thank you.

32:22.399 --> 32:25.277
I'm glad you came by.
- Of course.

32:26.278 --> 32:27.488
Hi mate.

32:28.989 --> 32:30.658
Just like his father.

32:33.953 --> 32:35.287
Hang in there.

32:38.958 --> 32:40.834
Ride with me, Sylvia.

32:41.001 --> 32:45.005
Call if you need anything, Ineke.

32:54.306 --> 32:58.352
Whose blood was in the toilet, Eddie?
Dammit!

32:59.853 --> 33:01.605
Where did you go on Sunday?

33:04.566 --> 33:09.405
Sweet little Mitchell started dealing
and got caught.

33:09.571 --> 33:12.282
Then Gijs started to tattle to Brandsma.

33:12.783 --> 33:14.952
William the Silent found out.

33:15.119 --> 33:18.706
He sent a couple of bruisers to set him
straight.

33:20.833 --> 33:23.043
Remember the phone call on the beach...

33:32.720 --> 33:34.388
Two minutes...

33:36.557 --> 33:39.518
If I'd gotten there two minutes earlier...

33:44.732 --> 33:48.610
One of those guys accidentally smashed
his larynx.

33:52.114 --> 33:54.408
He died in my arms.

33:58.162 --> 34:02.291
They panicked and got a van
to make it look like an accident.

34:02.458 --> 34:06.545
But I couldn't...
- Stop it.

34:18.139 --> 34:19.308
Hey doll.

34:22.770 --> 34:23.896
Daphne.

34:25.856 --> 34:27.565
What's up with you?

34:27.733 --> 34:29.610
Ask her.

34:32.821 --> 34:34.406
Did anything happen?

34:34.572 --> 34:38.827
I advised her to transfer to jazz ballet.
- And why?

34:38.994 --> 34:43.540
She enjoys this.
- We prefer girls who stay under 5.7.

34:44.541 --> 34:45.583
She's too tall?

34:45.751 --> 34:48.712
Ballet is of course...
- ...for dwarfs?

34:49.213 --> 34:53.425
It's impossible for men to lift
tall ballerinas.

34:53.592 --> 34:56.678
Our advice...
- Stick it in your dwarf ass.

34:57.137 --> 34:59.973
Let's find another ballet school.

35:00.724 --> 35:02.476
A less snooty one.

35:06.396 --> 35:08.732
Leave it. No one's coming.

35:08.899 --> 35:12.736
That's their loss. We'll celebrate
with the girls from school.

35:12.903 --> 35:17.282
These girls only eat carrots anyway.
- No one from school will come.

35:17.449 --> 35:20.994
Marie Louise told everyone Dad's a criminal.

35:23.622 --> 35:24.957
Your father...

35:25.124 --> 35:26.750
has his own company.

35:26.917 --> 35:28.544
You know that, don't you?

35:28.710 --> 35:32.589
Steel cables, fishing lines...
What a bitch, this Marie Louise.

35:32.756 --> 35:34.550
I'll call her mother.
- Don't.

35:34.716 --> 35:36.468
Bloody gossip.
- Please don't, mom.

35:36.635 --> 35:38.762
She should mind her own business.

35:45.310 --> 35:48.730
What goes through your mind when you see my
name flash up on your display?

35:48.897 --> 35:51.775
Eddie Kronenburg, I'll just ignore it.
- I'm here, aren't I?

35:51.942 --> 35:54.027
I hope your money is here too.

35:54.778 --> 35:59.241
Let me explain.
- The money is self-explanatory.

36:00.284 --> 36:02.828
It's coming, I promise.
- You don't have it?

36:02.995 --> 36:05.873
So this is a waste of my time yet again?
- I wanted to explain.

36:06.498 --> 36:10.794
The Danish motor club I sold the stash...
- I really don't care.

36:10.961 --> 36:13.881
They didn't pay me.
- Give me a smoke.

36:15.257 --> 36:19.428
If you don't pay me the 200 grand
the men who financed this deal...

36:19.595 --> 36:22.514
will put me in a shit storm up to my ankles.
And they are not very nice people.

36:22.681 --> 36:26.560
I'll have to tell them where you live
with that slut of yours.

36:26.727 --> 36:28.478
I'll pay, you know I will.

36:28.645 --> 36:30.898
Have I ever not paid?
- Yes. Today.

36:31.064 --> 36:35.611
So it's 10% extra and another five for
leaving me with my dick in the wind.

36:35.777 --> 36:38.030
15%? Come on.
- Yes.

36:38.197 --> 36:40.616
Can't we talk about it.
- Of course we can.

36:47.497 --> 36:49.875
Now, I think we're done talking.

37:02.054 --> 37:03.847
Did Maaswanker pay up?

37:04.014 --> 37:05.766
No.
- Dude!

37:06.642 --> 37:09.978
If we don't pay The Silent,
our profit's out the window.

37:10.771 --> 37:15.150
Pills? That's not our business.
We'll get shit from the boss.

37:15.317 --> 37:19.279
The Silent likes everything I do.
'Cos what I do makes money.

37:20.781 --> 37:25.494
Also, I need some more cash.
I'm opening a beach club for Sylvia.

37:25.661 --> 37:28.872
A bar? More trouble than it's worth.

37:29.081 --> 37:34.628
You said she should have something to do.
- Collecting rubber ducks, doing crochet.

37:35.712 --> 37:39.174
Empty again? Ease up on the pills.

37:39.925 --> 37:44.304
You know what?
You never complain when you're not here.

37:44.471 --> 37:46.807
Call that pill pusher's number.

37:47.933 --> 37:51.144
Tell him we're expanding our assortment.

38:07.828 --> 38:10.747
You did say that.

38:11.498 --> 38:13.083
Hey, Eddie.

38:15.544 --> 38:17.879
Look who's here.

38:18.755 --> 38:19.756
Hey, man.

38:20.048 --> 38:23.385
Frans... bed boy. How are you?
- Fine.

38:23.552 --> 38:26.596
He found me on Facebook.
- You're on Facebook?

38:26.763 --> 38:29.599
Yes.
- Daphne accidentally tagged a photo.

38:29.766 --> 38:31.226
By chance.

38:31.393 --> 38:32.811
By chance.

38:32.978 --> 38:36.398
The kids showed me how
to find people on Facebook.

38:36.565 --> 38:41.028
Ones you haven't seen for 13 years?
- Our HQ is Rotterdam.

38:41.486 --> 38:44.156
Amsterdam too small for the mattress mogul?

38:44.323 --> 38:47.576
Frans has a house in the Caribbean.

38:47.743 --> 38:49.411
It's great for the kids.

38:49.578 --> 38:54.416
You're always welcome.
I hear Sylvia's starting her own business?

38:54.583 --> 38:58.086
I told him.
- A beach club. Right up her alley.

38:58.253 --> 39:00.714
I'll finally earn my keep.

39:02.716 --> 39:05.010
Another one?
- Please.

39:12.392 --> 39:15.520
You can stop the show, Frans.
Why are you here?

39:17.105 --> 39:20.275
Are you still... in the...

39:22.319 --> 39:25.447
I mean, do you still have the...

39:26.490 --> 39:29.493
Let's go for a drive. It'll fix your stutter.

39:32.829 --> 39:34.748
See... It's possible, Eddie.

39:35.165 --> 39:39.419
Frans changed track, out of the blue.

39:39.586 --> 39:40.796
He just got out.

39:40.962 --> 39:43.590
And now he's got it made.
25 stores throughout the country.

39:43.757 --> 39:46.051
Yeah, Frans has it all.

39:46.551 --> 39:47.969
But I've got you.

39:48.136 --> 39:53.934
So who's the one who's got it all?
- That's sweet. You're still jealous of my ex.

40:00.315 --> 40:03.443
Isn't it a bit warm for this.

40:03.610 --> 40:06.196
It's hot.
- But you're not that hot.

40:06.613 --> 40:09.282
Screw you!
- ls that the little mouse again?

40:34.683 --> 40:37.144
Jerkoff, learn to drive somewhere else.

40:38.186 --> 40:40.147
Pass, or piss off.

41:06.298 --> 41:08.049
Dammit.

41:20.437 --> 41:24.649
Having trouble staying on the move, Grandpa?

41:29.654 --> 41:31.448
Marvin wants a word.

41:32.324 --> 41:33.408
Come on.

41:45.921 --> 41:48.632
I heard you were expanding, Eddie?

41:48.798 --> 41:50.091
That won't work now, will it?

42:16.826 --> 42:18.578
Hi, sweetie.
- Hey Mom.

42:19.037 --> 42:21.790
What did that man say?
- She had to go to ballet.

42:23.083 --> 42:27.128
He didn't stop you talking to her?
- Did I say that?

42:27.671 --> 42:29.714
What's her name?
- Sanne.

42:30.674 --> 42:32.342
I think she likes you.

42:32.509 --> 42:34.636
Mom!
- I won't say anything.

42:43.311 --> 42:45.981
What did he want?
- What do you care?

42:46.648 --> 42:49.276
Daphne, what did he ask you?

42:50.318 --> 42:52.237
If Dad was on the beach Sunday.

42:57.534 --> 43:01.079
And what did you say?
- That I didn't remember. Okay.

43:14.342 --> 43:16.219
Stay focused, Eddie.

43:32.360 --> 43:33.653
Fuck.

43:36.448 --> 43:38.658
You shouldn't jerk off so hard.

43:38.825 --> 43:40.410
This asswipe ran right into it.

43:40.577 --> 43:43.872
And that's nothing compared to
what The Silent will do to them.

43:47.500 --> 43:48.918
What are you doing?

43:49.628 --> 43:52.255
Let's not bother the Silent with this?

43:52.422 --> 43:56.384
I won't let some Belgian jackass make
a fool of me. Now drive.

43:59.179 --> 44:02.223
Belgian jackass... Marvin?
- How many Belgian jackasses do you know?

44:02.390 --> 44:05.101
Telling us what we can or can't do?

44:05.268 --> 44:09.189
Hey Eddie, I have bad news
about that pill deal.

44:09.356 --> 44:13.902
Since it's the first time, he wants
300 grand as a down payment.

44:14.069 --> 44:17.322
So let's forget it.
- Let's not.

44:18.698 --> 44:20.784
It's not going to work.

44:21.076 --> 44:25.080
Do you ever listen to a word I say.
300 large.

44:25.538 --> 44:28.625
We're not going to ask The Silent
to foot the bill again.

44:28.792 --> 44:31.503
Especially since we haven't even ponied up
the Maaswinkel money yet.

44:31.670 --> 44:34.255
We're gonna do it.
I know someone else who can shell out.

44:34.422 --> 44:36.675
You do?
- Yes. Remember Frans?

44:36.841 --> 44:40.136
The mattress mogul?

44:41.429 --> 44:43.390
What?

44:45.183 --> 44:48.478
Of course, but you're a Capricorn.
- Hey Syl, ladies.

44:48.645 --> 44:50.939
Hey.
- Well, Frans?

44:51.481 --> 44:54.150
Ineke.

44:54.317 --> 44:57.404
I thought I'd invite Frans.

44:57.570 --> 44:59.656
What happened to your hand?

44:59.823 --> 45:04.411
It was this one, last night in bed.
She prefers it a bit rough.

45:04.577 --> 45:06.705
The story gets better every time.

45:06.871 --> 45:09.833
Well, Frans.
Meet my best friend Ineke.

45:14.838 --> 45:18.425
Here's to your great success, Frans.

45:18.591 --> 45:20.385
Thank you. Cheers.
- To success.

45:20.552 --> 45:22.679
Let's hope it returns soon.

45:25.473 --> 45:28.935
You didn't know?
The bed business is failing.

45:29.102 --> 45:32.856
Didn't you tell her, Frans?
- We're reorganizing.

45:33.022 --> 45:35.567
We need to diversify.
- Diversify.

45:35.734 --> 45:38.111
All his stores are
leveraged up the wazoo now.

45:38.278 --> 45:41.448
But you can always count on your friends.

45:41.614 --> 45:45.535
We're going for a swim.
Some place where there's no jellyfish.

45:48.830 --> 45:51.666
You want the other one done too?
- Please.

45:51.833 --> 45:53.334
Ineke, keep straight.

45:53.501 --> 45:56.212
You should have seen that coming, Frans.

45:56.379 --> 45:59.257
Telling tales to Eddie Kronenburg?

45:59.424 --> 46:01.009
She's 13.

46:01.468 --> 46:02.844
Mom.
- And no alcohol.

46:03.011 --> 46:04.262
You have it here?

46:26.284 --> 46:27.911
Hey, hey, Sugar.

46:28.077 --> 46:32.165
I'm in Traffic. Can you pick up Daphne?
- Why don't you ask Ineke?

46:32.457 --> 46:35.376
Why do you think?
- Well...

46:42.509 --> 46:43.635
Hey Syl.

46:49.766 --> 46:51.476
Would you like a drink?

46:51.643 --> 46:53.728
What are you putting together with Eddie?

47:00.276 --> 47:04.197
Listen Syl, I think these things are just...
- Cut the crap, Frans.

47:04.572 --> 47:05.824
Eddie is getting out.

47:08.743 --> 47:10.495
Come and sit down then.

47:21.631 --> 47:24.843
Here, from the bed mogul.
- Did you count it?

47:25.009 --> 47:27.929
What do you think?
- I think not.

47:34.853 --> 47:37.939
I can't come along. I have to be a Dad.

47:38.106 --> 47:40.900
Really? So I can do your dirty work?

47:41.067 --> 47:43.444
You asked for more responsibilities?

47:43.611 --> 47:46.948
Fine. I'll drop by the casino on the way.
- Excuse me?

47:47.365 --> 47:51.619
I'll play 300 grand on red.
- Sure, you do that.

47:51.786 --> 47:54.455
Give my regards to the pill pusher.
Tell 'em we'll be best friends.

48:11.055 --> 48:14.183
I thought Mom was coming.
- Lucky you. It's me.

48:14.976 --> 48:17.353
Buckle up.

48:17.854 --> 48:19.731
How did it go?

48:19.898 --> 48:23.026
Not bad. It's kind of okay.
- Kind of okay?

48:23.693 --> 48:29.824
It's jazz ballet? It's Cool. I wish
I'd been allowed to do jazz ballet.

48:40.752 --> 48:43.755
Stay here. I'm going to the bank.
I'll be right back.

49:20.750 --> 49:24.379
Having a hard time to keep moving, sonny?

49:24.545 --> 49:27.548
Having a hard time, hey!

50:29.527 --> 50:35.033
What an asshole, that father of yours.
God, what an ass.

50:40.496 --> 50:42.790
I saw Dad beat someone up.

50:44.333 --> 50:45.418
What?

50:46.669 --> 50:47.837
Yesterday.

50:48.004 --> 50:50.673
Your father?
- Didn't I just say that?

50:50.840 --> 50:52.341
Were the police around?

50:52.508 --> 50:54.093
Did... did he...

51:00.767 --> 51:03.102
Sorry sweetie, were you scared?

51:05.813 --> 51:07.565
I just want to know.

51:21.037 --> 51:22.830
You're right, sweetheart.

51:25.166 --> 51:27.085
He doesn't sell fishing nets.

51:35.551 --> 51:37.470
He sells drugs.

51:39.138 --> 51:40.890
Your father sells drugs.

51:47.021 --> 51:48.606
I'm so sorry.

51:48.773 --> 51:50.399
Like that'll do me a lot of good.

51:54.028 --> 51:56.114
And you? What do you do?

51:56.280 --> 51:57.949
What do you do?

52:04.872 --> 52:06.499
Nothing, baby.

52:08.084 --> 52:09.836
I don't do anything.

52:10.253 --> 52:12.130
I look after you.

52:13.840 --> 52:15.675
I look after you two.

52:30.106 --> 52:31.107
Eddie!

52:34.610 --> 52:35.444
Hello?

52:35.611 --> 52:37.488
It's me. Open up, Charlie.

52:37.655 --> 52:40.491
I know Eddie's here.
I want to talk to him!

52:40.658 --> 52:43.744
It's bad timing.
- I'll scream until you open up.

52:43.911 --> 52:46.080
Calm down. Hold on.

52:47.206 --> 52:49.667
Syl, Eddie is on his way.

52:59.927 --> 53:03.806
Not here, Syl.
- So this is you getting out of the business?

53:03.973 --> 53:07.643
Syl! Dammit.
- With the last of Frans' money.

53:07.810 --> 53:10.605
Go home. You don't know
what you're talking about.

53:10.771 --> 53:12.815
And Daphne doesn't know either, I suppose?

53:12.982 --> 53:16.068
Go home.
- You beat someone up...

53:16.235 --> 53:19.030
Right in front of her.
- I was just 'settling an account'.

53:19.197 --> 53:21.824
It's lousy that the saw it, but that happens.

53:21.991 --> 53:24.577
No, it only happens to you!

53:24.744 --> 53:25.912
Dammit!

53:27.747 --> 53:30.333
It takes time, Syl.

53:31.292 --> 53:33.461
What were you thinking?

53:36.339 --> 53:40.593
And that beach club's been sold.
But not to me.

53:44.263 --> 53:45.473
Fuck!

53:48.976 --> 53:53.439
Honey, you need to pack a suitcase.

53:57.693 --> 54:01.989
Stupid, stupid cow.

54:03.115 --> 54:05.952
What rock were you living under?

54:06.911 --> 54:08.204
Sylvia?

54:15.336 --> 54:17.421
Easy. Daph is home.

54:20.007 --> 54:23.886
Why the fuck did you go there?
- Let's get out of here.

54:24.053 --> 54:28.474
The four of us. A Caribbean island.
A fresh start.

54:28.641 --> 54:33.312
We don't need all this.
- We don't? You think you can just leave?

54:33.479 --> 54:35.356
You forgot about this?

54:37.900 --> 54:39.235
Eddie... I...

54:41.195 --> 54:42.697
Baby...

54:44.573 --> 54:49.537
I swear, if you take the kids...
I'll kill myself.

54:49.704 --> 54:51.539
"Mom?

54:51.706 --> 54:53.291
We're coming.

54:53.666 --> 54:55.376
We're a family.

55:02.216 --> 55:04.927
Hey, beautiful... Mom won't be long.

55:05.136 --> 55:06.887
Motherfucker.

55:17.189 --> 55:18.065
And?

55:18.858 --> 55:21.319
Well. Mom's is better.

55:21.485 --> 55:24.030
Listen to Jamie Oliver here.

55:25.072 --> 55:27.199
Watch your shirt.

55:32.371 --> 55:34.707
Why didn't you cook, mom?
- Sweetheart I...

55:34.874 --> 55:37.543
Mom was a bit busy. Weren't you, doll?

55:37.710 --> 55:41.005
With what? The beach club is off, right?
- Honey...

55:41.172 --> 55:42.715
Why is it off?

55:42.882 --> 55:48.679
I've been thinking. Maybe we need a break.
The four of us.

55:49.805 --> 55:50.848
Vacation.

55:51.015 --> 55:52.725
Recharge the batteries.

55:53.100 --> 55:54.560
Great idea, right?

55:55.186 --> 55:56.937
Christ.

55:58.647 --> 55:59.690
Girls.

56:04.111 --> 56:05.363
I have to go to judo class.

56:05.738 --> 56:08.032
I'll take you. I'm going
into town anyway.

56:08.199 --> 56:11.285
Suddenly a father? I'll take him.

56:11.452 --> 56:14.622
It's no problem. I like being Dad.

56:14.789 --> 56:16.832
Dad?
- I'm coming.

56:16.999 --> 56:19.835
In the mean time you can unpack your suitcase.

56:26.926 --> 56:30.054
Die motherfucker!
- Seatbelt, buddy.

56:35.142 --> 56:36.352
Crap.

56:44.735 --> 56:48.406
Also pack for your brother.
I'll be back with him in a minute.

57:05.965 --> 57:07.800
I have to pick something up.

57:07.967 --> 57:11.178
Will we still make it?
- Easy peasy.

57:15.182 --> 57:18.602
So how are things at Judo?
- Great. We're sparring today.

57:18.769 --> 57:24.233
You'll be a real killer one day.
- The sensei says judo's not about fighting.

57:24.942 --> 57:30.906
And McDonald's is not about burgers.
- It's better to avoid the fight, he says.

57:31.198 --> 57:32.825
Is that what he says?

57:52.970 --> 57:54.180
Duck!

58:05.107 --> 58:06.233
No...

58:09.028 --> 58:10.654
Yuri!

58:10.988 --> 58:12.114
Baby.

58:17.244 --> 58:18.954
Angel...

58:19.121 --> 58:20.789
Are you all right? Hurt?

58:21.499 --> 58:23.876
He's okay. I covered him.

58:24.752 --> 58:26.795
Syl, help me.

58:27.296 --> 58:29.548
Help me.

58:30.549 --> 58:31.967
Help me please.
- No.

58:32.134 --> 58:34.553
Fuck, Syl.

58:43.854 --> 58:47.024
Syl, dammit.

58:58.786 --> 59:02.873
What about Dad?
- The ambulance is coming. It's okay.

59:15.594 --> 59:17.972
I'll drive.
- What's the fuck's wrong with you?

59:18.138 --> 59:21.058
Move over.
- Don't bleed all over my seats.

59:32.194 --> 59:35.114
How many clothes should I pack for him?

59:35.281 --> 59:36.365
Mom?

59:39.868 --> 59:41.287
As much as you can.

59:47.126 --> 59:50.379
It was Marvin.
- Marvin? The Silent wouldn't let him.

59:50.546 --> 59:52.965
Who else?
- Maaswinkel?

59:53.132 --> 59:55.593
That coward?
- Gijs' mates?

59:55.759 --> 59:59.305
He didn't have any left.
There's no doubt, It was Marvin.

59:59.471 --> 01:00:01.473
Hey, move it lady.

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:04.143
Old cow. Come on!

01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:06.979
It's a one way street.
- Yes, my way.

01:00:23.162 --> 01:00:27.541
Hey, momma bear. Pedal faster!
My God, come on.

01:00:27.708 --> 01:00:30.919
She won't talk.
- I hope so for your sake.

01:00:31.211 --> 01:00:33.797
She knows everybody.
She has seen everything.

01:00:33.964 --> 01:00:38.260
She can link The Silent to Gijs. Who knows
what the fuck you've told her all those years?

01:00:38.427 --> 01:00:41.805
Sylvia doesn't know anything
and won't say anything.

01:00:50.397 --> 01:00:53.442
You with your bitchin blabber mouth.

01:00:53.609 --> 01:00:58.155
If she starts singing, we're all fucked.
- Why do you think I'm driving like this?

01:01:08.248 --> 01:01:10.709
Shit, shit, shit.

01:01:10.876 --> 01:01:12.044
Clear off.

01:01:12.544 --> 01:01:15.464
Come on.
- Motherfucker!

01:01:19.218 --> 01:01:21.053
Help me, come on. Push.

01:02:26.201 --> 01:02:28.162
Just wait for me here.

01:02:31.039 --> 01:02:32.082
Mom?

01:02:32.499 --> 01:02:33.709
I'll be right back.

01:02:44.386 --> 01:02:47.556
Hey, Syl!

01:02:51.185 --> 01:02:53.145
I need your help.

01:02:59.234 --> 01:03:01.487
We have to go out the back.

01:03:15.709 --> 01:03:17.127
Is it him?

01:03:22.716 --> 01:03:23.801
Eddie...

01:03:35.979 --> 01:03:37.856
What happened to your hand?

01:03:38.398 --> 01:03:41.026
Where are my kids?

01:03:49.284 --> 01:03:50.536
You drive.

01:03:50.702 --> 01:03:53.747
Where to?
- To Ineke.

01:03:53.914 --> 01:03:57.501
No, first Frans. No, Ineke.
- She's not stupid.

01:03:57.668 --> 01:04:01.255
Doesn't she have any friends further out?
-Just drive.

01:04:07.052 --> 01:04:11.431
You're all set up.

01:04:15.644 --> 01:04:17.145
Thank you.

01:04:25.445 --> 01:04:26.488
Hey Ineke.
- Syl?

01:04:26.655 --> 01:04:29.658
Can I call you back later?
- Please turn it down.

01:04:29.825 --> 01:04:32.953
I'm just visiting someone.

01:04:33.495 --> 01:04:36.748
Sick, right? Look at all the blood squirting.
- Who are you visiting?

01:04:37.583 --> 01:04:38.834
My mother.

01:04:40.335 --> 01:04:42.462
But Syl...
- Are you doing okay?

01:04:42.629 --> 01:04:47.050
I'm okay but listen Syl,
Eddie says you've gone...

01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:51.054
You know what, let me call you right back.
- Syl?

01:04:53.599 --> 01:04:57.769
You moron, you have to turn round.
You're a sitting duck!

01:05:08.322 --> 01:05:11.366
He still a little tired from yesterday.

01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:17.748
When are we going back to Daddy?

01:05:32.512 --> 01:05:35.015
Take it easy on the pills. Lance Armstrong is
a boy scout compared to you.

01:05:35.182 --> 01:05:38.226
I'm supposed to suffer?
- A little, yes. You might learn a lesson.

01:05:38.393 --> 01:05:40.979
This is what a pierced dick
looks like, Tromp.

01:05:41.146 --> 01:05:44.608
Is it a nice little hole, Kronenburg?
- If it isn't the anti-doping brigade.

01:05:44.775 --> 01:05:50.113
Why did you leave the scene of a crime?
- My wife said dinner was ready.

01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:52.574
No idea who the shooter was of course.

01:05:52.741 --> 01:05:56.495
I was too busy dodging bullets
to make a sketch for you.

01:05:56.662 --> 01:06:00.290
Apparently I'm not the only one
who's fed up with you.

01:06:06.922 --> 01:06:09.466
Can I go now?
- I don't think so.

01:06:09.633 --> 01:06:12.469
We're going for a chat at the station.

01:06:13.804 --> 01:06:15.555
That's enough, okay?

01:06:16.056 --> 01:06:17.265
Off you go.

01:07:20.454 --> 01:07:22.497
You're afraid of him, aren't you?

01:07:28.045 --> 01:07:29.963
You have to go to the police.

01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:34.551
I'll get us a drink.

01:07:41.725 --> 01:07:44.227
You can stay as long as you like.

01:07:44.394 --> 01:07:46.104
I have to leave.

01:07:47.147 --> 01:07:50.442
It's dangerous.
For you. And your child.

01:07:52.402 --> 01:07:53.695
Does he hit you?

01:07:56.948 --> 01:07:59.451
Does he hit the children?
- No.

01:08:02.037 --> 01:08:03.747
I'm really leaving.

01:08:04.414 --> 01:08:06.374
I'm leaving the country.

01:08:06.958 --> 01:08:08.085
I know what to do.

01:08:09.878 --> 01:08:11.713
So what does he do?

01:08:13.173 --> 01:08:14.716
He's just a dick.

01:08:14.925 --> 01:08:16.843
That's what he does.

01:08:30.732 --> 01:08:33.902
Pick up the phone, bitch.

01:08:44.746 --> 01:08:45.913
What's this?

01:08:46.081 --> 01:08:49.167
The first installment of...
- Excuse me?

01:08:49.584 --> 01:08:50.794
That's 2000.

01:08:50.961 --> 01:08:53.421
2000? That's not even the interest!

01:08:55.715 --> 01:09:00.095
Did you read the papers recently?
And he was a buddy of mine.

01:09:00.679 --> 01:09:03.473
Out of my car, go on!

01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:07.519
It's my car...
- Not any more.

01:09:12.899 --> 01:09:15.652
You said he'd pay, cocksucker.

01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:17.487
Take it easy.

01:09:17.654 --> 01:09:21.575
L just passed on a message.
- You could have checked. Now what?

01:09:23.702 --> 01:09:27.997
Pay up. You don't want to cross The Silent.
- You? So now it's just my problem.

01:09:28.165 --> 01:09:32.752
You know what I mean.
Can you drive with your tool in a towel?

01:09:32.961 --> 01:09:35.505
You think it's funny?

01:09:39.259 --> 01:09:41.845
Move.

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:43.889
Ass wipe.

01:09:55.984 --> 01:09:57.194
Hello.
- Frans, it's Syl.

01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:59.821
Hey, Syl.
- I need a favor.

01:10:10.373 --> 01:10:12.292
You fucking...

01:10:17.923 --> 01:10:21.218
ls there an earlier flight?
Stopovers are no problem.

01:10:24.471 --> 01:10:25.972
Why don't you ever pick up?

01:10:28.892 --> 01:10:31.228
Syl's voicemail. Speak after the beep.

01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:36.399
...bitch. You really did it this time.
No one steals from me. You hear that?

01:10:36.566 --> 01:10:39.277
I found three seats for tomorrow.
- Three?

01:10:40.654 --> 01:10:43.740
Didn't he say we had to take a vacation?

01:10:43.907 --> 01:10:47.494
Recharge the batteries.
- Going through Atlanta and Miami.

01:10:47.661 --> 01:10:50.413
So two stopovers and 400 Euro's more.

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:52.123
Fine, I'll take it.

01:10:52.290 --> 01:10:57.796
Then it will be 2,875 Euro's and
you'll fly tomorrow at 11.40 am.

01:10:57.963 --> 01:11:01.091
Dad will join us later?
- We'll talk about that later?

01:11:01.258 --> 01:11:05.679
I don't think I can accept...
- My credit card is acting up.

01:11:14.562 --> 01:11:16.940
Baby, it's just not safe.

01:11:18.566 --> 01:11:21.152
For me?
- What do you think?

01:11:21.987 --> 01:11:23.905
Is he still in hospital?

01:11:25.156 --> 01:11:27.242
Why doesn't he come here then?

01:11:28.868 --> 01:11:33.748
Because Dad is afraid those men
on the scooter might come too.

01:11:35.375 --> 01:11:37.168
I'm going home.
- Chill, you.

01:11:37.335 --> 01:11:38.670
Come back.

01:11:41.715 --> 01:11:43.383
Such a difficult age.

01:12:01.401 --> 01:12:03.236
Let's look in the train station.

01:12:12.370 --> 01:12:13.913
Yuri! Hey!

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:15.999
Dammit.

01:12:16.249 --> 01:12:18.543
What the hell was that?

01:12:19.794 --> 01:12:21.087
I want to go home.

01:12:28.345 --> 01:12:29.804
It's 35 short.

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:32.390
Hundred?
- Thousand.

01:12:32.807 --> 01:12:35.810
Don't worry. It'll be here on Monday.

01:12:37.145 --> 01:12:38.605
Is he in?

01:12:39.147 --> 01:12:42.317
I'd like a word with him
about that Belgian jackass.

01:13:04.881 --> 01:13:06.299
Marvin?

01:13:22.148 --> 01:13:24.150
So I got shot at.

01:13:28.154 --> 01:13:30.657
With my son in the car.

01:13:35.370 --> 01:13:39.499
That may be hunky dory in Belgium,
but over here, family is off limits.

01:13:39.666 --> 01:13:42.502
And for what? A couple of fucking pills?

01:13:47.215 --> 01:13:52.137
That warning was over the top.
We don't wave Uzis around in public.

01:13:55.014 --> 01:13:56.349
But it's his slice of the business.

01:13:57.684 --> 01:13:58.810
What?

01:14:05.358 --> 01:14:10.780
Surely we can work something out.
Please William. There must be some way...

01:14:21.082 --> 01:14:24.294
You're behaving like a bunch of babies.

01:14:25.170 --> 01:14:26.421
This ends now.

01:14:27.714 --> 01:14:33.011
Did I see your wife at Teerlink's funeral,
blabbering to a police detective?

01:14:33.678 --> 01:14:37.432
Sylvia won't say anything.
She doesn't even know anything.

01:14:40.059 --> 01:14:41.311
Yes.

01:14:49.986 --> 01:14:51.613
Jesus Eddie.

01:14:51.863 --> 01:14:55.241
Everybody can see you. Idiot.
- What are you doing here?

01:14:58.953 --> 01:15:00.038
Come on.

01:15:00.663 --> 01:15:05.627
I thought you wanted to swing by Frans?
- You have 5 for me? I need some cash.

01:15:06.461 --> 01:15:11.758
I want to get Syl a little something.
for when she's back. To smooth things over.

01:15:13.468 --> 01:15:16.012
Look at yourself, man.

01:15:17.722 --> 01:15:23.770
Stop popping pills, stop boozing, pull
yourself together or she won't come back.

01:15:23.978 --> 01:15:25.021
Sure.

01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:30.944
You're my big brother. Get back
on track. You're my only family.

01:15:35.448 --> 01:15:36.699
Charlie?

01:15:39.744 --> 01:15:41.246
What do they want from you?

01:15:41.955 --> 01:15:43.039
I don't know.

01:15:45.667 --> 01:15:46.668
Here...

01:15:49.128 --> 01:15:53.216
It's around 1500. It's all I have on me.
- I said five?

01:15:53.424 --> 01:15:56.553
Let's call rehab next week. Okay?

01:16:06.479 --> 01:16:12.068
Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday to you...

01:16:19.576 --> 01:16:21.494
Sweetheart.

01:16:21.703 --> 01:16:24.914
Did you think we'd forgotten?
- Hip hip hurray.

01:16:26.791 --> 01:16:28.251
Did you?

01:16:28.418 --> 01:16:31.838
My baby.
Make a wish?

01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:36.718
Off you go. Blow them out.
All 14 of them.

01:16:44.225 --> 01:16:46.185
You know what I wished for?

01:16:46.352 --> 01:16:49.480
Sshhh.
Or it won't come true.

01:16:50.565 --> 01:16:53.234
But I think I can guess...

01:16:56.195 --> 01:16:57.322
Lovey.

01:17:06.122 --> 01:17:07.206
Eddie!

01:17:08.416 --> 01:17:10.710
What's going on?
- Not now, Frans.

01:17:10.877 --> 01:17:13.212
I want to know what's up, now.

01:17:13.379 --> 01:17:14.797
Okay. Well, we got fucked.

01:17:14.964 --> 01:17:17.216
Belgian customs confiscated it all.

01:17:17.383 --> 01:17:21.387
There is no customs at the Belgian border.
- Police then. Now get lost.

01:17:21.554 --> 01:17:24.974
I want my money back then. Now!

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:27.477
I borrowed it, goddamnit!

01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:47.705
So now you can shut the fuck up?

01:17:58.591 --> 01:18:02.095
You ruined me, Eddie.
- Don't you start.

01:18:05.014 --> 01:18:07.392
You don't deserve Sylvia.

01:18:11.396 --> 01:18:13.398
What d'you know about Syl?

01:18:18.444 --> 01:18:23.074
Did you put your sweaty paws on her?
You bed boy son of bitch.

01:18:24.534 --> 01:18:27.078
Where is she? Where is she?

01:18:35.753 --> 01:18:37.964
I can barely understand you.

01:18:41.259 --> 01:18:42.552
Chantal...

01:19:04.323 --> 01:19:06.909
I hope he understands.

01:19:07.493 --> 01:19:10.455
Wonderful honey. You look beautiful.

01:19:10.955 --> 01:19:12.457
Sleep tight.

01:19:22.008 --> 01:19:24.218
It's the shop's buzzer.

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:27.388
Are you expecting anyone?
- No.

01:19:27.555 --> 01:19:29.432
I'll check it out.

01:19:30.975 --> 01:19:32.477
Careful, okay?

01:19:43.488 --> 01:19:45.948
Syl! ls Syl here with you?

01:19:46.824 --> 01:19:48.284
We're closed.

01:19:49.327 --> 01:19:50.369
Syl!

01:19:50.995 --> 01:19:52.497
Syl! Syl!

01:19:52.663 --> 01:19:56.209
You have to come outside, Syl.
We need to talk.

01:19:56.375 --> 01:19:59.712
There's nothing to talk about.
- You're in danger.

01:19:59.921 --> 01:20:03.674
The longer you all stay...
- You are the danger, Eddie.

01:20:03.925 --> 01:20:05.301
You stay with the kids.

01:20:08.262 --> 01:20:10.181
Syl, you know too much baby.

01:20:10.348 --> 01:20:13.976
The longer you stay in hiding,
the more they panic.

01:20:14.143 --> 01:20:16.938
I won't squeal.
- That's not the fucking point.

01:20:17.730 --> 01:20:20.399
It's what they think that matters.

01:20:21.442 --> 01:20:24.028
Baby, come with me.
Open the door.

01:20:24.195 --> 01:20:26.072
Syl, he)!-

01:20:26.572 --> 01:20:27.824
Please open up.

01:20:28.616 --> 01:20:30.451
I want to see the kids.

01:20:30.618 --> 01:20:33.329
Where are they? Daphne! Yuri!
- They're not here.

01:20:34.038 --> 01:20:35.748
Open the door. Come on.

01:20:36.165 --> 01:20:38.125
Open up. They have to come.

01:20:40.962 --> 01:20:43.631
Dammit, Syl! Open the door!

01:20:43.798 --> 01:20:46.843
You know what you're doing to me.
You know I can't live without them.

01:20:47.009 --> 01:20:49.136
Piss off or I'll call the cops!

01:20:49.303 --> 01:20:53.140
Fuck off, bitch!
I'm talking to my wife here.

01:20:53.307 --> 01:20:54.809
No. No police.

01:20:55.268 --> 01:20:59.146
Eddie is leaving now. Right?
He's leaving now.

01:21:11.993 --> 01:21:13.536
Sorry.

01:21:24.589 --> 01:21:26.215
No, Eddie, no!

01:21:27.008 --> 01:21:29.051
Come out now. Come on out.

01:21:29.218 --> 01:21:31.637
What's he doing?
- We'll talk tomorrow.

01:21:31.804 --> 01:21:33.931
No, you come out now.
- Dammit...

01:21:34.098 --> 01:21:36.601
It's Chantal's business.
She's got nothing to do with this.

01:21:36.767 --> 01:21:38.603
She doesn't?

01:21:39.604 --> 01:21:41.480
Well now she does.
- No!

01:21:41.647 --> 01:21:42.607
No.

01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:48.654
Jesus Christ.

01:21:58.039 --> 01:21:59.582
Asshole.

01:22:31.822 --> 01:22:34.533
We have to get out.
Hey, sweetie! Now!

01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:37.078
Wake up. Let's go.

01:22:37.745 --> 01:22:39.705
Yuri!

01:22:42.458 --> 01:22:45.294
Charlie, Eddie has lost his mind.

01:22:45.461 --> 01:22:48.214
Please call. I don't know what's going on?

01:22:54.971 --> 01:22:56.347
I'm sorry.

01:22:56.514 --> 01:22:58.349
You better hurry.

01:23:33.009 --> 01:23:36.470
Where are we going?
- Just keep walking, Yuri.

01:24:01.495 --> 01:24:03.164
Go back, go back.

01:24:05.082 --> 01:24:07.501
Quickly.

01:24:11.422 --> 01:24:13.007
In here.

01:24:18.179 --> 01:24:19.889
Yuri?
- Dad?

01:24:37.323 --> 01:24:38.783
Sshhh.

01:25:34.797 --> 01:25:36.048
Let's go.

01:25:49.895 --> 01:25:50.938
Here, honey.

01:25:51.689 --> 01:25:52.940
Mom.
- Sylvia!

01:25:53.941 --> 01:25:56.318
How are the children?

01:25:56.694 --> 01:25:58.779
Say hello to Grandma.

01:25:59.113 --> 01:26:00.322
Hi Grandma.

01:26:00.698 --> 01:26:03.409
Happy belated birthday, sweetie.

01:26:03.576 --> 01:26:04.743
Thanks.

01:26:07.371 --> 01:26:11.458
Hello, Grandma.
- Hello lovey. I miss you.

01:26:11.625 --> 01:26:12.668
Yes.

01:26:14.170 --> 01:26:18.591
Mom, it could be a while before you...
We're leaving.

01:26:19.300 --> 01:26:22.011
And I want you to know why...
- I know.

01:26:22.928 --> 01:26:24.722
Eddie was here.

01:26:25.431 --> 01:26:27.558
I always knew it.

01:26:28.726 --> 01:26:29.768
I'm sorry.

01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:33.355
Call me when you're safe.
- Yes.

01:26:33.814 --> 01:26:35.900
Bye,honey.
-Bye.

01:26:45.284 --> 01:26:46.285
Well...

01:27:05.638 --> 01:27:06.972
Theo?

01:27:10.726 --> 01:27:11.644
No.

01:27:19.985 --> 01:27:22.112
I told the police everything.

01:27:22.988 --> 01:27:25.032
Yes, but you haven't told me.

01:27:29.703 --> 01:27:30.955
Where are they?

01:27:59.024 --> 01:28:00.734
Wait for me here.

01:28:00.901 --> 01:28:02.111
I'll be right back.

01:28:02.278 --> 01:28:03.654
Can I have a Coke?
- Yes.

01:28:03.821 --> 01:28:07.324
As much as you want. Wait here, okay?
You keep an eye on him.

01:28:25.509 --> 01:28:27.928
THE VULTURES ARE CIRCLING

01:29:05.132 --> 01:29:07.259
No, no.

01:29:09.887 --> 01:29:11.055
Daphne?

01:29:12.222 --> 01:29:13.724
Daphne and Yuri?

01:29:17.269 --> 01:29:18.479
Daphne!

01:29:19.730 --> 01:29:21.023
Yuri!

01:29:24.151 --> 01:29:25.069
Well well.

01:29:25.235 --> 01:29:27.488
You had a busy night.

01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:30.074
No you don't.

01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:34.161
We got a call from the Alkmaar police.
They spoke to your friend Chantal.

01:29:34.328 --> 01:29:35.871
Where's your husband?

01:29:36.163 --> 01:29:37.790
I don't know. Get lost.

01:29:37.956 --> 01:29:40.042
Take it easy.

01:29:43.087 --> 01:29:45.047
I'm trying to find my children.

01:29:49.093 --> 01:29:50.386
That'll be them.

01:29:56.809 --> 01:29:59.645
Mom? We're in the car with Dad.

01:29:59.812 --> 01:30:03.399
He says we're going away together.
- Wait a sec, dear.

01:30:07.069 --> 01:30:08.487
Hey, babe.

01:30:10.155 --> 01:30:12.157
Where are you?

01:30:12.324 --> 01:30:15.452
We're waiting for you.
Deck 2 of the car park.

01:30:15.619 --> 01:30:18.122
We'll leave together.
Isn't that much friendlier?

01:30:18.747 --> 01:30:21.792
Right. I'm on my way.
- Who is with you?

01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:27.840
You'll wait for me, right?

01:30:28.841 --> 01:30:31.343
Ten minutes, Syl.
Or you'll never see them again.

01:30:32.386 --> 01:30:34.388
Okay honey, see you in a minute.

01:30:35.055 --> 01:30:38.183
We'll tag along?
Then you can tell us about the fire.

01:30:38.976 --> 01:30:41.603
Sylvia. Think hard about it this.

01:30:41.770 --> 01:30:46.275
First Gijs Teerlink... Now Frans.
And you almost had to bury your son.

01:30:47.109 --> 01:30:50.237
You have to choose...
Eddie or your children.

01:30:53.157 --> 01:30:57.327
You can talk freely.
We'll guarantee your safety.

01:31:01.123 --> 01:31:02.332
You will?

01:31:06.211 --> 01:31:07.963
Just like you did for Gijs Teerlink?

01:31:22.728 --> 01:31:24.480
Put your foot down.

01:31:24.897 --> 01:31:28.233
Now turn left and go back to the car park.

01:31:28.442 --> 01:31:30.068
Faster!

01:32:04.645 --> 01:32:07.022
I told you...
everything's going to be alright.

01:32:07.898 --> 01:32:09.066
Mom?

01:32:18.283 --> 01:32:20.244
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie,

01:32:20.536 --> 01:32:22.454
Dude!.

01:32:41.807 --> 01:32:46.228
Where shall we go?
France? Spain? The Himalayas?

01:32:51.358 --> 01:32:55.195
Eddie, I love you.
And so do the kids.

01:32:56.405 --> 01:33:00.659
Let's forget about all of this,
go home and take care of things...

01:33:02.077 --> 01:33:04.288
Barcelona, let's go there!

01:33:04.454 --> 01:33:07.291
Yuri? We'll go to the stadium.
Watch a game.

01:33:08.792 --> 01:33:12.671
Eddie. My love...
- You can go shopping there, Daphne.

01:33:32.649 --> 01:33:34.568
Who is it?
- No one!

01:33:49.166 --> 01:33:52.544
Go suck on that! You motherfucker.

01:33:52.711 --> 01:33:54.713
This is Eddie Kronenburg!

01:33:55.339 --> 01:33:57.674
Okay, where were we? Barcelona!

01:33:57.841 --> 01:34:00.427
Or Manchester!
We can watch Van Persie play.

01:34:00.594 --> 01:34:04.014
Ed, we're going home.
- Shut up! It's done.

01:34:04.890 --> 01:34:08.143
We're in this together.

01:34:19.071 --> 01:34:23.742
Where does Little Red Riding Hood
want to go?

01:34:23.909 --> 01:34:28.497
Where does Little Red Riding Hood
want to go?

01:34:32.417 --> 01:34:35.837
Everything's alright now.

01:34:36.004 --> 01:34:39.257
Everything's alright?!
Are you out of your mind?

01:34:39.675 --> 01:34:43.679
Everything's in ruins, Eddie.
Our whole life is ruined.

01:34:48.767 --> 01:34:53.313
And I've let it all happen.
- So it isn't just Eddie's fault?

01:34:57.359 --> 01:35:01.780
Daphne and Yuri still have a chance.
It's not too late for them.

01:35:01.947 --> 01:35:03.615
They can still have a normal life.

01:35:03.782 --> 01:35:06.451
You guys are nothing without me.
Zippo, zilch.

01:35:07.661 --> 01:35:11.707
They're your children.
- Yes and I'm going to protect them.

01:35:11.873 --> 01:35:16.002
They're going to kill us all, Eddie!
You stupid son of a bitch.

01:35:16.169 --> 01:35:19.172
Don't you get it?
You're just blind.

01:35:19.339 --> 01:35:22.801
Let me out, now. Stop the car.

01:35:22.968 --> 01:35:25.470
Stop the fucking car!

01:35:30.434 --> 01:35:31.935
So you want to get out?

01:35:35.397 --> 01:35:37.691
Get out then.
- Not here.

01:35:38.525 --> 01:35:41.778
Why not? You wanted to get out.
- With the kids.

01:35:41.945 --> 01:35:45.574
You're the only one who wanted out.
I didn't hear the kids.

01:35:45.741 --> 01:35:48.952
So get out. Get lost.

01:35:49.119 --> 01:35:54.416
God damn it. Get out.
If you want to desert us, go ahead!

01:35:57.794 --> 01:35:59.004
Eddie!

01:35:59.671 --> 01:36:01.173
Go.

01:36:12.392 --> 01:36:14.102
Drive off the tracks.

01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:18.231
We'll talk about it.
- Oh, so now we can talk.

01:36:18.398 --> 01:36:22.694
I'll go with you. Wherever you want.
- I don't believe you anymore.

01:36:22.861 --> 01:36:27.616
Do you guys?
Yuri? No one believes you.

01:36:27.783 --> 01:36:29.743
Go. Go on.

01:36:46.301 --> 01:36:47.803
Hey!

01:36:48.804 --> 01:36:49.846
Hey,buddy!

01:36:55.477 --> 01:36:56.478
Eddie!

01:37:08.907 --> 01:37:14.412
You've finally shut up. Nothing left
to say, right? Just like Gijs.

01:38:16.266 --> 01:38:17.642
It's okay, buddy.

01:38:18.476 --> 01:38:19.519
It's alright.

01:40:14.009 --> 01:40:16.803
Give my love to mom.

01:40:38.783 --> 01:40:40.702
Hola, señora.
- Hola, ninos.

01:40:43.872 --> 01:40:45.957
Hey, angels.
- Hi, Mom.

01:40:48.418 --> 01:40:50.462
Homework?
- Mateméticas.

01:40:51.254 --> 01:40:52.589
Mateméticas...

01:42:23.012 --> 01:42:23.930
No.

01:42:25.181 --> 01:42:26.182
It's all right.

01:42:28.893 --> 01:42:29.769
Isn't it?

01:42:57.964 --> 01:42:59.340
Who was that, Mom?

01:43:00.091 --> 01:43:01.593
No one, baby.

01:43:04.095 --> 01:43:05.263
Are we going?

01:43:15.648 --> 01:43:16.608
Hey, kids.

01:43:18.985 --> 01:43:20.695
Home before dark.
