WEBVTT

00:07.268 --> 00:09.226
OH.

00:09.270 --> 00:11.054
WOW.

00:11.098 --> 00:12.534
YEAH.

00:12.577 --> 00:14.927
WHY'D IT TAKE SO LONG
FOR US TO DO THIS?

00:14.971 --> 00:17.278
NO IDEA.

00:17.321 --> 00:19.323
WAS IT WORTH
THE WAIT?

00:19.367 --> 00:22.109
MM-HMM.

00:28.724 --> 00:31.857
WAIT.
WHAT WERE YOU GONNA TELL ME LAST NIGHT?

00:31.901 --> 00:35.644
YOU KNOW, BEFORE WE...
GOT DISTRACTED?

00:35.687 --> 00:38.125
SOMETHING ABOUT...

00:38.168 --> 00:40.910
WHO YOU REALLY ARE.

00:40.953 --> 00:43.434
RIGHT. THAT.

00:43.478 --> 00:47.177
OK. UM...

00:47.221 --> 00:49.136
SO, THERE'S

00:49.179 --> 00:52.356
NO WAY THIS ISN'T
GONNA SOUND CRAZY,

00:52.400 --> 00:54.663
SO...

00:54.706 --> 00:58.145
I...AM A DESCENDANT

00:58.188 --> 01:00.712
OF A LONG AND ANCIENT,

01:00.756 --> 01:04.673
MYSTICAL LINE OF...WARRIORS.

01:06.631 --> 01:09.591
I'VE BEEN AWOL LATELY BECAUSE
I'VE HAD MY HANDS FULL.

01:09.634 --> 01:11.897
UM, I--I DON'T JUST
FIGHT CRIMINALS.

01:11.941 --> 01:14.117
I ALSO FIGHT MORE...

01:14.161 --> 01:16.989
MAGICAL TYPES OF EVIL,

01:17.033 --> 01:20.123
LIKE M-MAGIC BAD GUYS.
HEH!

01:20.167 --> 01:22.125
SO...

01:23.431 --> 01:26.390
SO YOU'RE SAYING...

01:26.434 --> 01:29.350
THAT MAGIC IS REAL,

01:29.393 --> 01:32.614
THERE'S BAD MAGIC
AND GOOD MAGIC,

01:32.657 --> 01:36.139
AND...YOU ARE
THE GOOD MAGIC?

01:37.967 --> 01:40.187
WELL, THAT I BELIEVE.

01:43.538 --> 01:47.194
- YOU'RE REALLY NOT THROWN? -
I--I'M NOT SAYING THAT IT'S NOT WEIRD.

01:47.237 --> 01:50.849
- HEH! - I--I MEAN,
I--I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS,

01:50.893 --> 01:53.374
BUT NO.
♪ CHANGED MY HEART

01:55.419 --> 01:58.553
I KNEW THAT THERE
WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT YOU.

02:07.127 --> 02:10.782
OH, IT'S MY FINAL ALERT
FOR THE SHIFT AT THE CAFEÉ.

02:10.826 --> 02:13.176
I GOTTA JUMP
IN THE SHOWER.

02:13.220 --> 02:16.353
OH, MAN.

02:41.291 --> 02:44.207
BAM-BAM, COFFEE.
MM-HMM.

02:44.251 --> 02:46.470
- OH, THANKS.
- BUT YOU STILL HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING YET.

02:46.514 --> 02:48.472
- ABOUT WHAT?
- AHEM.

02:48.516 --> 02:50.474
- OH, BACK IN WORK CLOTHES...
- MMM.

02:50.518 --> 02:53.477
- LOOKING INCREDIBLE.
- MMM. LIFE IS GOOD.

02:53.521 --> 02:55.479
MWAH! HAVE A GOOD DAY.
YOU, TOO.

02:57.307 --> 02:59.266
HEY, DENNIS.
IS MEI-LI AROUND?

02:59.309 --> 03:01.833
MEI-LI: I'M IN THE KITCHEN, SEBASTIAN.
MM-HMM.

03:01.877 --> 03:04.227
'MORNING, BABA.
HOW YOU DOING?

03:04.271 --> 03:06.403
I KNOW YOU'RE
DISAPPOINTED.

03:06.447 --> 03:09.711
ANTHONY SOLD US OUT,
VOTED FOR ORDINANCE 11.

03:09.754 --> 03:12.409
HE KNOWS THE HARM
IT COULD DO,

03:12.453 --> 03:14.846
PUTTING THE SECURITY
OF OUR CITY IN THE HANDS

03:14.890 --> 03:17.284
OF A SHADY PRIVATE
SECURITY COMPANY.

03:17.327 --> 03:19.677
HE MUST HAVE THOUGHT HE
HAD NO CHOICE.

03:19.721 --> 03:21.940
THOSE STOLEN PHOTOS?
MM-HMM?

03:21.984 --> 03:24.247
FEELS LIKE HE WAS
TARGETED FOR BLACKMAIL.

03:24.291 --> 03:26.249
YOU THINK IT'S
THAT COMPANY--DELTA SECURITY ENDEAVORS?

03:26.293 --> 03:28.251
THEY'RE THE ONES THAT
WOULD BENEFIT THE MOST.

03:28.295 --> 03:30.514
THEY SPONSORED THE BILL;
THEY'D RAKE IN

03:30.558 --> 03:32.864
A LOT OF CITY MONEY
IF IT PASSED.

03:32.908 --> 03:34.866
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

03:34.910 --> 03:36.520
I'M GONNA CHANGE
HIS MIND.

03:36.564 --> 03:38.130
- REALLY, BABA?
- MM-HMM.

03:38.174 --> 03:40.350
- UH...
- HMM?

03:40.394 --> 03:42.613
- Y-YOU ARE?
- I GOTTA TRY.

03:42.657 --> 03:44.963
YOU KNOW, WHATEVER HIS
SECRET IS, IT'S NOT WORTH

03:45.007 --> 03:48.053
SELLING HIS SOUL, RIGHT? ALTHEA: MM-MMM, MM-MMM.
YEAH, IT'S NOT.

03:48.097 --> 03:49.316
- OK, I GOTTA GO.
- OH, OK.

03:49.359 --> 03:51.100
NICKY?

03:51.143 --> 03:53.102
AH!
GOOD MORNING, BABA.

03:53.145 --> 03:55.322
'MORNING.
OVERSLEPT?

03:55.365 --> 03:58.107
- GUILTY.
- OK. I GOTTA GO. SEE YA.

03:58.150 --> 04:00.631
- HAVE A GOOD DAY.
- ALL RIGHT. BYE!

04:00.675 --> 04:03.155
AHEM. NICKY?

04:03.199 --> 04:05.419
- YES?
- A--THAT WAS VERY CLOSE,

04:05.462 --> 04:08.422
AND B--TELL ME
ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING!

04:08.465 --> 04:11.294
WELL, N-NOT EVERYTHING.

04:13.340 --> 04:15.472
WHAT? IS THERE SOMETHING
WRONG WITH MY SEATING CHART?

04:15.516 --> 04:17.561
I KNOW IT'S OUR
FIRST BIRTHDAY TOGETHER.

04:17.605 --> 04:19.563
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET IT RIGHT.
MEI-LI: NO, NO, NO.

04:19.607 --> 04:21.348
YOUR SEATING CHART'S
FINE.

04:21.391 --> 04:23.654
IT'S THE DESSERT.

04:23.698 --> 04:25.569
HAS TO BE
CARROT CAKE.

04:25.613 --> 04:28.311
THAT'S ALL RYAN EVER
WANTS ON HIS BIRTHDAY.

04:28.355 --> 04:31.880
- CARROT CAKE? - SOMETIMES I
CAN'T BELIEVE HE IS MY SON.

04:31.923 --> 04:34.099
CARROT CAKE IT IS.

04:34.143 --> 04:35.579
I'LL SEE YOU
AT THE RESTAURANT.

04:35.623 --> 04:36.972
OK.

04:37.015 --> 04:39.017
- HEY, NICKY.
- HEY, SEB.

04:39.061 --> 04:41.324
'MORNING, MAMA.
MEI-LI: GOOD MORNING.

04:41.368 --> 04:44.022
I, UH, SLEPT
THROUGH MY ALARM.

04:44.066 --> 04:46.242
NOT SURE HOW
THAT HAPPENED.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.244
HENRY WAS LOOKING
FOR YOU.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.333
YEAH, YEAH.
I SAW HIS TEXTS.

04:50.377 --> 04:52.814
NOPE.
HE CAME HERE,

04:52.857 --> 04:55.382
LAST NIGHT, LATE.

04:55.425 --> 04:57.384
I WENT UP TO LOOK
FOR YOU, BUT, UM...

04:57.427 --> 04:59.951
OH. WHAT'D YOU SAY?

04:59.995 --> 05:01.953
TSK. I SAID...

05:01.997 --> 05:04.565
DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE YOU WERE.

05:14.096 --> 05:16.533
COULD I GET A TRIPLE
OATMILK VANILLA CAPPUCCINO

05:16.577 --> 05:18.535
WITH A DASH OF NUTMEG?
SERIOUSLY, CHLOE?

05:18.579 --> 05:21.146
HEH. NAH.
DRIP'S FINE.

05:21.190 --> 05:23.148
UH-HUH.
THERE ARE COFFEE SHOPS A LOT CLOSER

05:23.192 --> 05:25.063
TO THE SOONG FAMILY
CHARITABLE TRUST THAN THIS ONE.

05:25.107 --> 05:27.370
SO? WHAT,
I CAN'T SWING BY

05:27.414 --> 05:29.546
AND VISIT MY BROTHER
AT HIS NEW JOB?

05:29.590 --> 05:31.548
HEH! OK, FINE.

05:31.592 --> 05:34.464
LOOK, I NEED
YOUR HELP.

05:35.813 --> 05:37.772
WHAT'S UP?
'CAUSE IF THIS IS--

05:37.815 --> 05:40.775
NO, NO, NO.
I KNOW YOU'RE STILL NOT SPEAKING WITH THE PARENTALS.

05:40.818 --> 05:43.299
I AM NOT GONNA TRY
AND FORCE THAT ONE AGAIN.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.519
IT'S ABOUT MY JOB
AT THE TRUST.

05:45.562 --> 05:47.521
I THINK THAT SOME MONEY
HAS GONE MISSING,

05:47.564 --> 05:49.784
LIKE, A LOT OF MONEY.

05:49.827 --> 05:53.004
UH, PLEASE TELL ME
THAT I'M WRONG.

05:59.141 --> 06:01.578
CHLOE, THIS IS BAD.

06:01.622 --> 06:03.754
WHAT HAPPENED?

06:07.018 --> 06:09.412
- HEY, HEY, JIN.
- THEY GOT TO YOU.

06:09.456 --> 06:11.414
GOT TO ME?

06:11.458 --> 06:13.242
THE BRIEFCASE,
THE PHOTOS.

06:13.285 --> 06:15.462
YOU'RE BEING TARGETED,
BEING BLACKMAILED.

06:15.505 --> 06:18.552
HEY.
COME ON.

06:21.511 --> 06:24.471
THE REASON I CHANGED
MY VOTE IS VERY SIMPLE.

06:24.514 --> 06:27.082
THE POLLS SHOW--
YEAH, YOU SOLD OUT.

06:27.125 --> 06:29.476
WHATEVER WAS IN
THOSE PHOTOS, WHATEVER YOU'RE

06:29.519 --> 06:31.565
TRYING TO HIDE,
IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

06:31.608 --> 06:34.350
IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO CHANGE YOUR MIND.
IT'S NOT SELLING OUT.

06:34.394 --> 06:37.614
IT'S READING THE ROOM.
PEOPLE ARE SCARED.

06:37.658 --> 06:40.095
THEY WANT TO FEEL SAFE.
ORDINANCE 11 WILL HELP.

06:40.138 --> 06:43.098
BESIDES, IF I HAD VOTED
NO, I'D LOSE THE RACE.

06:43.141 --> 06:45.666
WHERE WOULD THAT
GET US THEN?

06:45.709 --> 06:48.233
I WASN'T GONNA SAY
ANYTHING UNTIL AFTER THE PRIMARY,

06:48.277 --> 06:50.932
BUT I'M CREATING A
NEW POSITION IN MY OFFICE.

06:50.975 --> 06:53.935
DIRECTOR OF OUTREACH--
SOMEONE TO RESHAPE HOW

06:53.978 --> 06:56.154
OUR CAMPAIGN ENGAGES
WITH THE COMMUNITY,

06:56.198 --> 06:59.027
SOMEONE WHO CAN REALLY CHANGE
HOW POLITICS WORKS IN THE CITY.

06:59.070 --> 07:01.029
I GOT TO GET
REELECTED FIRST,

07:01.072 --> 07:03.553
BUT I WANT YOU
IN THAT ROLE.

07:04.946 --> 07:06.991
THINK ABOUT IT, OK?

07:08.950 --> 07:11.692
YEAH?
WANT TO TALK TO YOU...

07:13.389 --> 07:15.391
CARRIE, WHAT'S THIS?

07:15.435 --> 07:18.916
FEATURE ON THE CITY'S HOTTEST UP-AND-COMING CHEFS.
TAKE A LOOK.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.918
AH! HEH HEH!

07:20.962 --> 07:22.920
AND THIS IS
A PROBLEM?

07:22.964 --> 07:25.706
I THOUGHT WE WANTED
PRESS FOR THE RESTAURANT.

07:25.749 --> 07:29.274
THAT'S JUST THE ISSUE.
IT'S NOT FOR THE RESTAURANT.

07:29.318 --> 07:32.495
"THIS RISING STAR IS
SHATTERING CONVENTIONS

07:32.539 --> 07:34.497
"WITH HIS FRESH
FUSION TAKE

07:34.541 --> 07:36.499
"ON HARMONY DUMPLINGS'

07:36.543 --> 07:38.501
TYPICALLY
TRADITIONAL FARE."

07:40.372 --> 07:42.853
YOU'RE NOT EVEN MENTIONED.

07:42.897 --> 07:45.856
I KNOW THAT YOU DON'T
CARE ABOUT THAT,

07:45.900 --> 07:48.598
BUT OUR COMPANY IS
INVESTING IN THE MEI-LI SHOW,

07:48.642 --> 07:52.167
NOT THE SEBASTIAN SHOW,
AND YOU KNOW OUR CONCERN

07:52.210 --> 07:55.170
ABOUT FUSION
DIMINISHING THE BRAND.

07:55.213 --> 07:57.694
SEBASTIAN DID
THAT INTERVIEW WEEKS AGO.

07:57.738 --> 07:59.696
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

07:59.740 --> 08:02.699
CARRIE, WHERE IS THIS
COMING FROM?

08:05.572 --> 08:07.487
SEBASTIAN'S A PROBLEM.

08:09.401 --> 08:11.621
I SAW HIS RECORD.

08:11.665 --> 08:14.276
A CONVICTION
FOR MANSLAUGHTER?

08:17.235 --> 08:20.717
I NEGOTIATED FOR
OVERSIGHT ON ALL HIRING.

08:20.761 --> 08:22.980
HIRING HIM WAS
MY CHOICE.

08:23.024 --> 08:26.767
BY THE TERMS OF OUR CONTRACT, YOU
ARE OBLIGATED TO DISCLOSE THAT TO US,

08:26.810 --> 08:29.030
AND YOU DIDN'T.

08:29.073 --> 08:31.336
I AM SORRY.

08:31.380 --> 08:33.643
HE HAS TO GO.

08:38.779 --> 08:40.607
PEI-LING: HENRY,

08:40.650 --> 08:43.653
WHEN YOU SAW HER,
HOW WAS SHE?

08:48.266 --> 08:49.572
I SEE.

08:49.616 --> 08:52.401
I ONLY CAUGHT A GLIMPSE.

08:52.444 --> 08:54.925
HEY, SORRY I'M LATE.

08:54.969 --> 08:56.927
UH, WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:56.971 --> 08:58.799
HENRY SAW ZHILAN.

08:58.842 --> 09:01.584
WHAT? HOW?
I TOLD YOU,

09:01.628 --> 09:03.978
DURING THE RITUAL, MY
COMPASS POWERS KICKED IN.

09:04.021 --> 09:06.415
I COULD SEE INTO
THAT OTHER WORLD.

09:06.458 --> 09:09.418
JUST THESE...SNAPSHOTS.

09:09.461 --> 09:12.464
I HAD TO SIT WITH THEM,
BUT SHE WAS THERE,

09:12.508 --> 09:14.989
IN THE WASTELAND.
I--I SAW HER DIE

09:15.032 --> 09:17.252
IN THE SOURCE REALM, THOUGH.
HOW--HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?

09:17.295 --> 09:19.297
WHEN THE REALM COLLAPSED,
YOU SAID YOU HOPED

09:19.341 --> 09:21.691
THE WARRIORS' AND GUARDIANS'
SPIRITS FOUND THEIR WAY TO

09:21.735 --> 09:24.041
A BETTER PLACE? MAYBE
THIS WASTELAND IS IT;

09:24.085 --> 09:28.089
I MEAN, MINUS THE "BETTER" PART.
PEI-LING: AND THEY ARE NOT ALONE.

09:28.132 --> 09:32.093
YOU SAW THEM
BEING HUNTED BY THIS MAN.

09:32.136 --> 09:34.617
XIAO SAID HE IS WORKING FOR HER,

09:34.661 --> 09:37.838
COLLECTING THEIR SPIRITS
TO MAKE HER STRONGER.

09:37.881 --> 09:41.624
BUT XIAO CAN'T GET OUT
NOW, RIGHT? YOU CAGED HER INSIDE YOU?

09:41.668 --> 09:45.106
SHE IS TRAPPED FOR NOW,
BUT IF THIS FRIEND

09:45.149 --> 09:48.109
OF HERS IS FEEDING HER,
SENDING HER SPIRITS,

09:48.152 --> 09:50.981
SOON SHE WILL BECOME
TOO POWERFUL TO CONTAIN.

09:51.025 --> 09:53.549
WE WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.812
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT
THIS FRIEND OF XIAO'S?

09:55.856 --> 09:58.641
NOTHING ABOUT HIM,
BUT I DREW THESE.

09:58.685 --> 10:01.252
HIS BLADES--THE HILTS HAVE
A PRETTY UNIQUE DESIGN.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.649
MAYBE WE COULD TRY
TO MATCH THE SYMBOLS?

10:06.693 --> 10:08.651
WON'T HAVE TO.

10:08.695 --> 10:11.219
READ ABOUT THIS GUY WHEN
I FIRST LEARNED ABOUT THE BLOODLINES.

10:11.262 --> 10:13.221
LIVED IN
THE YUAN DYNASTY,

10:13.264 --> 10:15.223
BIT OF A CRANK;
HE'S OBSESSED

10:15.266 --> 10:17.225
WITH FINDING
THE BLOODLINE'S DESCENDANTS,

10:17.268 --> 10:19.227
CLAIMED
THEY WERE A STAIN

10:19.270 --> 10:21.664
ON HUMANITY,
NEEDED TO BE ERASED.

10:21.708 --> 10:23.927
HE WAS ALSO
A BLACKSMITH AND A MYSTIC.

10:23.971 --> 10:26.277
HE FORGED THIS WEAPON
TO BE STRONG ENOUGH

10:26.321 --> 10:28.802
TO CUT THE WARRIORS AND
GUARDIANS DOWN FOR NATURAL DEATH,

10:28.845 --> 10:31.152
BUT WITH A SPECIAL FEATURE,
A FAILSAFE--

10:31.195 --> 10:33.241
AN ENCHANTED HILT.

10:33.284 --> 10:35.678
SUPPOSEDLY, HE COULD
TRAP THEIR SOULS.

10:35.722 --> 10:38.768
OK, WHAT'S THE NAME
OF THIS MYSTIC BLACKSMITH BLOODLINE-HATER?

10:38.812 --> 10:40.901
UH, WU JIAN.

10:40.944 --> 10:43.164
UH, THE BLADES HAVE
A LONG HISTORY.

10:43.207 --> 10:46.384
UH, SOLD TO A PRIVATE
COLLECTOR IN 1992.

10:46.428 --> 10:48.691
THEY WERE REPORTED
STOLEN 4 MONTHS AGO,

10:48.735 --> 10:50.911
JUST DAYS AFTER
THE EARTHQUAKE,

10:50.954 --> 10:53.348
THE COLLAPSE OF THE SOURCE REALM.
PEI-LING: AND MY RETURN.

10:53.391 --> 10:55.785
MAYBE XIAO'S FRIEND
STOLE THEM FOR HER.

10:55.829 --> 10:57.787
MAYBE, BUT, NICKY,
THIS OTHER PLACE,

10:57.831 --> 10:59.833
IT'S NOT OUR WORLD,
SO HOW THE HELL

10:59.876 --> 11:02.836
DID THEY GET FROM HERE TO
THE WASTELAND? NICKY: I DON'T KNOW...

11:02.879 --> 11:04.838
BUT...

11:04.881 --> 11:07.841
IF THE BLADES CAN GET
FROM HERE TO THERE,

11:07.884 --> 11:09.843
MAYBE I CAN, TOO.

11:09.886 --> 11:12.628
MAYBE I CAN STOP THIS.

11:22.551 --> 11:24.684
AAH!

11:27.208 --> 11:30.167
AH, COME ON!

11:46.357 --> 11:48.838
SO YOU WANT TO TELEPORT
TO THE WASTELAND?

11:48.882 --> 11:51.145
IT MIGHT BE THE ONLY WAY
TO STOP XIAO'S MINION FROM FEEDING HER

11:51.188 --> 11:53.538
MORE SOULS AND TO
PROTECT PEI-LING.

11:53.582 --> 11:55.758
OK, SOUNDS GOOD
IN THEORY, BUT HOW DO

11:55.802 --> 11:57.760
WE FIND THIS PLACE,
LET ALONE GET THERE?

11:57.804 --> 11:59.936
IT'S NOT LIKE WE HAVE
A MAP OF THE MULTIVERSE.

11:59.980 --> 12:03.766
MAYBE NOT A MAP, BUT...
WE DO HAVE A COMPASS.

12:05.725 --> 12:09.772
HOLD ON.
THE ONLY REASON WHY MY POWERS ACTIVATED WAS BECAUSE OF THE RITUAL.

12:09.816 --> 12:12.122
I COULD ONLY SEE INTO
THE WASTELAND BECAUSE OF

12:12.166 --> 12:14.124
THAT SPIRIT ENERGY
COMING IN FROM THAT WORLD.

12:14.168 --> 12:16.387
WITHOUT THAT BOOST,
I DOUBT I COULD DO IT AGAIN.

12:16.431 --> 12:18.694
THE COMPASS
LOCATES MAGIC.

12:18.738 --> 12:21.349
THE BLADES ARE
ENCHANTED, MAGICAL.

12:21.392 --> 12:25.179
EVEN IF I COULD LOCK ON TO THE
BLADES, THAT STILL WOULDN'T GET YOU OVER THERE.

12:25.222 --> 12:27.834
WE JUST PULLED OFF
SOME SERIOUS HOCUS POCUS

12:27.877 --> 12:29.966
TO GET PEI-LING
INSIDE HER OWN MIND.

12:30.010 --> 12:32.795
I'M SURE WE CAN
FIGURE THIS OUT.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.841
WE HAVE TO.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.583
THIS IS THE LAST BOX.

12:38.627 --> 12:42.239
BABE, CHECK THIS AGAINST THE
SOONG CHARITABLE TRUST'S BANK RECORDS.

12:42.283 --> 12:44.024
PASSWORDS?

12:45.677 --> 12:48.158
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
LETTING US USE YOUR OFFICE.

12:48.202 --> 12:51.901
OF COURSE.
SO WHEN DID YOU FIRST NOTICE THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG?

12:51.945 --> 12:54.469
LAST NIGHT. I HAD SCORED
THIS HUGE DONATION,

12:54.512 --> 12:56.645
AND I WENT TO GO SEE IF
THE CHECK CLEARED, BUT THEN I NOTICED

12:56.688 --> 12:58.734
THAT THE ACCOUNT BALANCE
HAD GONE WAY DOWN.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.997
I MEAN, ACCOUNTING'S BOUND
TO NOTICE ANY MINUTE,

13:01.041 --> 13:04.044
AND THEN, AS SOON AS THEY DO,
MOM AND DAD ARE GONNA GO BALLISTIC.

13:04.087 --> 13:07.438
I MEAN, WITH MY HISTORY, THEY'RE
GONNA THINK THAT I STOLE IT.

13:07.482 --> 13:09.832
I'M SURE THAT'S NOT TRUE.
THEY WILL.

13:11.225 --> 13:13.662
I FOUND THE DAY AND TIME
OF THE THEFT--

13:13.705 --> 13:15.882
LAST WEDNESDAY--
9:43 P.M.

13:15.925 --> 13:20.016
THEY TRANSFERRED THE MONEY
TO AN UNTRACEABLE OFFSHORE ACCOUNT.

13:21.888 --> 13:24.194
AND IT WAS
FROM YOUR OFFICE.

13:24.238 --> 13:26.718
OH, MY GOD!

13:26.762 --> 13:29.025
DON'T WORRY.
THIS IS ACTUALLY GOOD NEWS.

13:29.069 --> 13:31.680
HOW IS THIS GOOD NEWS?

13:31.723 --> 13:34.639
BECAUSE NOW WE KNOW
THE THEFT WAS AN INSIDE JOB,

13:34.683 --> 13:37.860
SOMEONE WITH PASSWORDS,
PROXIMITY, ACCESS.

13:37.904 --> 13:40.036
SOMEONE YOU KNOW.

13:42.256 --> 13:45.346
I'M JUST SCRATCHING THE SURFACE
IN MY RESEARCH INTO DELTA SECURITY,

13:45.389 --> 13:48.349
BUT...BLACKMAIL FITS
THE PATTERN.

13:50.394 --> 13:53.136
HOW DID THEY KNOW
TO TARGET ANTHONY THAT NIGHT?

13:53.180 --> 13:55.530
IT WAS
INTERNAL RESEARCH,

13:55.573 --> 13:59.055
INFORMATION PAID FOR
BY THE CAMPAIGN.

13:59.099 --> 14:02.319
WELL, THEY COULD HAVE SOURCES
INSIDE THE COMPANY YOU HIRED.

14:02.363 --> 14:04.887
THEY COULD HAVE A MOLE
INSIDE THE CAMPAIGN

14:04.931 --> 14:06.889
OR JUST GOOD,
OLD-FASHIONED SPYING.

14:06.933 --> 14:08.891
INTERCEPTING
THAT RESEARCH PAID OFF,

14:08.935 --> 14:11.459
BOUGHT THEM A VOTE
FOR THEIR ORDINANCE.

14:11.502 --> 14:14.244
ANTHONY DENIED HE WAS
BLACKMAILED RIGHT TO MY FACE.

14:14.288 --> 14:16.986
INSTEAD, HE
OFFERED ME A JOB.

14:17.030 --> 14:19.119
YOU GONNA TAKE IT?

14:21.948 --> 14:24.298
DO YOU WANT
MY HONEST OPINION?

14:24.341 --> 14:28.084
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO
JUSTIFY WORKING INSIDE OF A CORRUPT SYSTEM.

14:28.128 --> 14:31.174
IT'S NOT WORTH IT.
HIS OFFER...

14:31.218 --> 14:33.873
HE'S BUYING MY SILENCE.

14:38.965 --> 14:41.315
FOUND SOMETHING.

14:41.358 --> 14:43.926
OK, WE'VE EXHAUSTED
XIAO'S JOURNALS

14:43.970 --> 14:46.363
AND THE HISTORY BOOKS,
SO I DECIDED TO LOOK ELSEWHERE.

14:46.407 --> 14:48.452
CHINESE FOLKTALES?

14:50.019 --> 14:51.716
"THE EMPEROR'S WITCH"?

14:51.760 --> 14:53.936
IT'S ABOUT AN EVIL WITCH
IN THE EMPEROR'S COURT.

14:53.980 --> 14:56.939
SHE PERFORMED EXTREME ACTS
OF MAGIC TO PROVE HER VALUE,

14:56.983 --> 14:59.942
INCLUDING EXPERIMENTS
ON THE LOCAL PEASANTRY.

14:59.986 --> 15:02.292
HER FINAL TRICK--
VANISHING THESE SUBJECTS

15:02.336 --> 15:04.947
RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE EMPEROR,
SENDING THEM OFF TO OTHER WORLDS.

15:04.991 --> 15:07.167
WELL, CERTAINLY SOUNDS LIKE XIAO.
YEAH, OR LIKE

15:07.210 --> 15:09.952
ANY EVIL WITCH FROM ANY FOLKTALE
FROM ANY OTHER CULTURE ON EARTH.

15:09.996 --> 15:12.955
WELL, TIMING LINES UP.
WE KNOW SHE WORKED FOR THE EMPEROR.

15:12.999 --> 15:15.958
THESE EXPERIMENTS SOUND A LOT LIKE THE
ONES WE READ ABOUT IN THE JOURNALS.

15:16.002 --> 15:18.047
WHOA. LOOK.

15:20.006 --> 15:23.661
THE PENDANT-- THE SAME ONE
XIAO USED TO GET YOU HERE,

15:23.705 --> 15:26.621
AND WE THOUGHT IT ALLOWED TRAVEL
BETWEEN WORLDS, BUT THIS PROVES IT.

15:26.664 --> 15:28.971
YOU'RE GETTING
ALL THIS FROM A FOLKTALE?

15:29.015 --> 15:30.451
WE'VE DONE IT BEFORE.

15:30.494 --> 15:32.453
BESIDES,
THIS IS OUR BEST LEAD.

15:32.496 --> 15:35.108
PEI-LING: BUT I
DESTROYED THE PENDANT.

15:35.151 --> 15:38.198
MMM, I STILL HAVE
THE PIECES.

15:38.241 --> 15:40.852
WELL, COULDN'T BRING MYSELF TO THROW 'EM IN THE DUMPSTER.
SINCE WE HAVE 'EM...

15:40.896 --> 15:42.854
WE COULD TRY PUTTING
IT BACK TOGETHER.

15:42.898 --> 15:44.856
UH, PEI-LING SMASHED IT
PRETTY GOOD. WON'T BE EASY.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.858
NO MATCH FOR YOUR
STEADY DOCTOR HANDS.

15:46.902 --> 15:49.861
WELL, BEATS PULLING
A WEDDING RING OUT OF A--

15:49.905 --> 15:51.472
NEVER MIND.

15:53.082 --> 15:55.606
OK, ASSUMING WE
CAN FIX THE PENDANT,

15:55.650 --> 15:58.000
WE STILL NEED A WITCH.

15:58.044 --> 16:00.002
XIAO USED MAGIC
TO PULL THIS OFF, SO WE NEED

16:00.046 --> 16:02.570
TO FIND THE ORIGINAL SPELL
OR A DECENT SUBSTITUTE.

16:02.613 --> 16:05.181
I WILL CHECK
XIAO'S JOURNALS.

16:06.878 --> 16:08.358
THANK YOU.

16:08.402 --> 16:10.360
BYE.

16:10.404 --> 16:12.449
OH.

16:12.493 --> 16:14.016
AH. EVAN.

16:14.060 --> 16:17.019
THANK YOU FOR COMING.
OF COURSE.

16:17.063 --> 16:19.500
SO CARRIE SAYS I'M
IN BREACH OF CONTRACT.

16:19.543 --> 16:21.850
UNFORTUNATELY,
SHE'S RIGHT.

16:21.893 --> 16:24.157
I REVIEWED YOUR DEAL ON THE
WAY OVER, AND IT'S PRETTY CLEAR.

16:24.200 --> 16:27.725
YOU VIOLATED IT BY NOT DISCLOSING SEB'S RECORD.

16:27.769 --> 16:30.250
I THOUGHT I LED YOU
THROUGH THE FINE PRINT.

16:30.293 --> 16:32.252
YOU DID.

16:32.295 --> 16:35.603
CARRIE SAYS IF I DON'T
FIRE HIM, SHE'LL TELL CORPORATE.

16:37.474 --> 16:41.043
EVAN, I CANNOT
LOSE SEBASTIAN.

16:42.784 --> 16:45.265
IF I REFUSE--
A.H.I. COULD SUE YOU.

16:45.308 --> 16:48.616
I--I'D DO WHAT I CAN,
BUT THEY'D HAVE A STRONG CASE.

16:48.659 --> 16:51.097
WE'D FACE DEEP POCKETS,
AN ARMY OF LAWYERS.

16:51.140 --> 16:54.361
YOU COULD LOSE A LOT OF
MONEY, YOU COULD EVEN LOSE THE RESTAURANT.

16:57.320 --> 16:59.931
WELL, JUST, UH, DOUBLE-CHECKING.
HEH! COOL.

16:59.975 --> 17:01.933
OK. BYE!

17:01.977 --> 17:03.935
NOPE.

17:03.979 --> 17:05.937
JILL WAS AT
THE GIANTS GAME.

17:05.981 --> 17:08.114
SHE SAID SHE WAS
AT THE GAME.

17:08.157 --> 17:10.116
LET'S RUN HER STORY
AND SEE IF IT CHECKS OUT.

17:10.159 --> 17:12.118
RIGHT.

17:12.161 --> 17:14.120
GOD, AM I JUST
SO HOPELESSLY NAIVE?

17:14.163 --> 17:15.904
YOU'RE NEW AT THIS.

17:15.947 --> 17:17.906
I DO IT FOR A LIVING.

17:17.949 --> 17:21.127
HEH! YOU'VE BEEN AN
INVESTIGATOR FOR, LIKE, 4 DAYS.

17:21.170 --> 17:24.130
CAUGHT UP WITH MY OLD
FRIEND AND OUR CURRENT SUSPECT PAUL.

17:24.173 --> 17:27.307
- OH. DOES HE HAVE AN ALIBI?
- YUP. GIANTS GAME.

17:27.350 --> 17:29.787
WAIT.
JILL SAID THAT SHE WAS AT THE GIANTS GAME. DENNIS: HO HO!

17:29.831 --> 17:31.920
I KNOW.

17:31.963 --> 17:33.922
OH. OH!
YEAH.

17:33.965 --> 17:35.924
- PAUL AND JILL.
- I KNOW.

17:35.967 --> 17:38.361
WELL,
THEY HAVE ALIBIS.

17:39.971 --> 17:42.452
LOOKS LIKE MARINA'S OUR GIRL.
WHAT? NO!

17:42.496 --> 17:45.194
NO, I TOLD YOU, IT CAN'T BE HER.
I HIRED HER. SHE'S--

17:45.238 --> 17:47.762
SHE'S BECOME A FRIEND.
I MEAN, ALSO, HER FAMILY'S,

17:47.805 --> 17:50.286
LIKE, LOADED.
SHE DOESN'T NEED THE MONEY.

17:50.330 --> 17:52.462
DID YOU
AND YOUR FRIENDS

17:52.506 --> 17:54.725
NEED MONEY WHEN YOU
STARTED YOUR BLING RING?

17:56.162 --> 17:58.251
I BELIEVE I HAVE
FOUND SOMETHING.

18:02.429 --> 18:05.171
RYAN AND I LOOKED
AT THESE ALREADY,

18:05.214 --> 18:07.738
WHEN WE WERE TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT WHAT THE PENDANT DOES.

18:07.782 --> 18:11.307
- I MAY UNDERSTAND IT BETTER.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

18:11.351 --> 18:14.310
I CAN READ
THE SYMBOLS.

18:14.354 --> 18:16.965
XIAO AND I SHARE
A BODY.

18:17.008 --> 18:19.794
IT IS AS IF I KNOW
WHAT SHE KNOWS.

18:19.837 --> 18:23.319
MAGICAL TRANSLATION SKILLS.
SOUNDS FAMILIAR.

18:23.363 --> 18:25.321
TH-THIS IS
XIAO'S MAGIC,

18:25.365 --> 18:27.149
UH, TRAVELER MAGIC.

18:27.193 --> 18:29.499
I CAN READ
THIS SPELL.

18:29.543 --> 18:32.241
GUESS WE FOUND
OUR WITCH.

18:32.285 --> 18:34.243
GOOD NEWS--
I DID IT!

18:34.287 --> 18:36.158
BAD NEWS...

18:36.202 --> 18:37.768
LOOKS LIKE THAT.

18:39.335 --> 18:41.816
DID YOU USE GLUE?
AND TWEEZERS.

18:41.859 --> 18:45.341
HEY, I'M A DOCTOR, NOT A JEWELER.
THANKS, RYAN.

18:45.385 --> 18:47.648
LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE

18:47.691 --> 18:50.216
POWER SOURCE, A WITCH,
AND A COMPASS.

18:50.259 --> 18:52.435
NO, YOU DON'T.

18:52.479 --> 18:54.742
I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU GUYS
COBBLE TOGETHER A PLAN BASED

18:54.785 --> 18:57.005
OFF OF MAYBES
AND WHAT IFS, USING MAGIC

18:57.048 --> 18:59.616
THAT...NONE OF US UNDERSTAND.

18:59.660 --> 19:02.445
HENRY, IF YOU HAVE ISSUES WITH PARTS
OF THE PLAN, WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT--

19:02.489 --> 19:05.231
NO, NOT PARTS.
ALL OF IT.

19:05.274 --> 19:08.234
I'M SORRY, BUT...

19:08.277 --> 19:10.323
I'M OUT.

19:20.420 --> 19:22.248
HENRY?

19:22.291 --> 19:24.075
PLEASE, WAIT.

19:26.252 --> 19:28.863
WHAT'S GOING ON? I'VE
NEVER SEEN YOU LIKE THIS.

19:28.906 --> 19:30.865
NICKY, THAT FAIRYTALE--

19:30.908 --> 19:33.389
YOU BLEW PAST THE MOST
IMPORTANT PART.

19:33.433 --> 19:36.914
THOSE...PEASANTS THAT XIAO FLUNG
OVER TO OTHER WORLDS,

19:36.958 --> 19:38.916
THEY NEVER CAME BACK.

19:38.960 --> 19:41.702
-  YEAH.
- EVEN IF WE GET LUCKY

19:41.745 --> 19:45.009
AND WE GET YOU OVER TO THE
WASTELAND, THAT COULD BE A ONE-WAY TICKET.

19:45.053 --> 19:47.011
I JUST...

19:47.055 --> 19:49.318
WE COULD LOSE YOU.

19:49.362 --> 19:51.451
I COULD LOSE YOU.

19:51.494 --> 19:54.845
YOUR LIFE WOULD BE
IN MY HANDS.

19:54.889 --> 19:57.413
WELL, WOULDN'T BE
THE FIRST TIME.

19:57.457 --> 20:00.416
I KNOW IT'S RISKY,
BUT WE'VE FACED DANGER BEFORE.

20:00.460 --> 20:02.418
WE'VE TRUSTED EACH OTHER
WITH OUR LIVES

20:02.462 --> 20:05.421
COUNTLESS TIMES,
AND WE'VE NEVER FAILED.

20:05.465 --> 20:08.250
I KNOW THINGS
HAVE CHANGED,

20:08.294 --> 20:10.252
BUT THAT TRUST,

20:10.296 --> 20:13.821
IT HASN'T GONE AWAY,
NOT FOR ME.

20:13.864 --> 20:17.303
I STILL BELIEVE IN IT.
I STILL BELIEVE IN US.

20:20.349 --> 20:22.438
I'LL TRY.

20:24.527 --> 20:25.311
ZOOM!

20:26.964 --> 20:29.837
MMM. SO, UH,
CHLOE TELLS ME

20:29.880 --> 20:31.447
YOU'VE MADE YOURSELF INDISPENSABLE

20:31.491 --> 20:33.101
AT THE TRUST.

20:33.144 --> 20:34.885
WE ARE SO LUCKY
TO HAVE YOU.

20:34.929 --> 20:37.148
DID YOU KNOW THAT THIS GIRL
HAD COMPETING OFFERS

20:37.192 --> 20:40.369
FROM ALL OF THE BIGGIES--
FORD, GATES, DANVERS?

20:40.413 --> 20:42.197
OH! WELL, WHAT MADE
YOU CHOOSE

20:42.241 --> 20:43.894
THE SOONG FAMILY
CHARITABLE TRUST?

20:43.938 --> 20:45.505
WELL, CHLOE, OBVS.

20:45.548 --> 20:48.290
I MEAN, WE JUST HIT IT OFF.
WE HAD SO MUCH IN COMMON.

20:48.334 --> 20:50.553
BUSINESS MAJORS, SKIERS,
ASPEN GIRLS...

20:50.597 --> 20:52.338
NOT VAIL.

20:52.381 --> 20:53.469
NO. NOT VAIL!

20:53.513 --> 20:54.644
ACTUALLY, ALTHEA,

20:54.688 --> 20:56.167
YOU GUYS HAVE
A LOT IN COMMON, TOO.

20:56.211 --> 20:57.517
MARINA CHEERED
IN COLLEGE.

20:57.560 --> 20:58.692
MADE NATIONALS
AND EVERYTHING.

20:58.735 --> 21:01.129
SENIOR YEAR, CLASS OF 2017.

21:01.172 --> 21:02.435
GO, TIGERS!

21:06.439 --> 21:09.355
MM. UM, SO...

21:09.398 --> 21:12.009
MARINA, I'VE BEEN MEANING TO ASK.
TOTAL BRAIN FOG.

21:12.053 --> 21:13.794
UH, WHO FLAKED ON WHOM?

21:13.837 --> 21:15.535
DID WE HAVE PLANS
LAST WEDNESDAY?

21:15.578 --> 21:17.406
IT WAS ME. SORRY.

21:17.450 --> 21:19.452
I CASHED IN MY VACATION DAYS
FOR A LONG WEEKEND.

21:19.495 --> 21:21.018
WHERE'D YOU GO?

21:21.062 --> 21:22.933
DON'T HATE ME. BORA BORA.

21:22.977 --> 21:24.239
YEAH.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.588
PICS,
OR IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

21:25.632 --> 21:27.024
OF COURSE.

21:28.591 --> 21:30.811
WOW.

21:30.854 --> 21:33.335
TIME-STAMPED
AND EVERYTHING.

21:33.379 --> 21:35.598
UH, YEAH. SO?

21:35.642 --> 21:37.818
UH, SORRY, MARINA. LOOK...

21:40.081 --> 21:42.518
A BUNCH OF MONEY GOT STOLEN
OUT OF THE TRUST LAST WEDNESDAY.

21:42.562 --> 21:44.564
WE KNOW IT'S
AN INSIDE JOB,

21:44.607 --> 21:46.000
SO WE JUST HAVE
TO RULE YOU OUT.

21:46.043 --> 21:48.611
OF COURSE. OH, MY GOD.
CHLOE, THAT'S AWFUL.

21:50.570 --> 21:53.399
OH.
HAVE YOU LOOKED INTO THAT PAUL GUY? ALWAYS GOT WEIRD VIBES FROM HIM.

21:53.442 --> 21:55.444
WILL YOU EXCUSE ME?
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

22:01.581 --> 22:02.582
HEY, BABE.

22:02.625 --> 22:03.626
HEY.

22:03.670 --> 22:05.367
MARINA HAVE AN ALIBI?

22:05.411 --> 22:07.151
YEAH. SEEMS LIKE IT.
ARE YOU BY A COMPUTER?

22:07.195 --> 22:08.370
YEAH. WHY?

22:08.414 --> 22:12.026
I NEED YOU TO CHECK ON
SOMETHING FOR ME.

22:14.637 --> 22:17.945
HEY, HEY! JIN. YOU
GIVE IT SOME THOUGHT?

22:17.988 --> 22:19.773
I'M NOT TAKING THE JOB.

22:19.816 --> 22:21.601
MAY I ASK WHY?

22:21.644 --> 22:24.430
YOU'RE BEING BLACKMAILED, ANTHONY.
YOU KNOW IT. I KNOW IT.

22:24.473 --> 22:26.432
JIN, THESE CONSPIRACY
THEORIES--

22:26.475 --> 22:28.434
AS LONG AS DELTA SECURITY'S
GOT DIRT ON YOU,

22:28.477 --> 22:29.783
THEY OWN YOU.

22:29.826 --> 22:32.438
AS LONG AS THAT
REMAINS TRUE,

22:32.481 --> 22:34.744
YOU'RE NOT FIT TO
REPRESENT THIS DISTRICT.

22:34.788 --> 22:37.617
SO YOU'RE LEAVING
THE CAMPAIGN?

22:37.660 --> 22:40.184
TO START.

22:40.228 --> 22:42.012
I'M RUNNING AGAINST YOU.

22:43.536 --> 22:44.841
WHAT?

22:44.885 --> 22:47.061
YOU'RE JOKING.

22:47.104 --> 22:48.454
THIS DISTRICT
DESERVES BETTER.

22:48.497 --> 22:50.064
AND THAT'S YOU?

22:50.107 --> 22:52.196
WE WILL FIND OUT
ON ELECTION DAY.

22:52.240 --> 22:55.025
MAY THE BEST CANDIDATE WIN.

22:58.725 --> 23:00.553
PEI-LING: THIS IS
WHERE I RETURNED.

23:00.596 --> 23:02.990
A PLACE OF PASSAGE.

23:03.033 --> 23:05.514
IT MIGHT MAKE IT EASIER FOR
YOU TO ACCESS YOUR POWERS.

23:05.558 --> 23:07.429
IT MIGHT.

23:24.707 --> 23:26.317
HERE WE GO.

23:29.538 --> 23:31.497
NO. I THOUGHT ABOUT HIM,
BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS

23:31.540 --> 23:33.324
TO ANY OF--

23:33.368 --> 23:35.457
I'M JUST NOTICING YOUR
BRACELET. I LOVE IT.

23:35.501 --> 23:37.024
I USED TO HAVE ONE
JUST LIKE THAT.

23:37.067 --> 23:38.678
THANK YOU.
I LOVE IT, TOO.

23:38.721 --> 23:40.593
I ALWAYS HAD TO TAKE MINE
OFF FOR CHEERLEADING.

23:40.636 --> 23:44.597
SUCH A PAIN, BUT WORTH
IT, RIGHT? FOR CHEER?

23:44.640 --> 23:45.859
OH, YEAH, TOTALLY.

23:52.213 --> 23:53.867
SPEAKING OF CHEER,

23:53.910 --> 23:57.305
WHEN YOU WENT TO NATIONALS,
DIDN'T YOU GUYS WIN?

23:57.348 --> 23:58.611
NO. WE PLACED.

23:58.654 --> 24:00.569
STILL, AMAZING.

24:00.613 --> 24:02.266
YOUR COACH MUST BE
SO GREAT.

24:02.310 --> 24:03.920
OH. WHAT WAS HER NAME
AGAIN?

24:03.964 --> 24:06.053
OH. HIS NAME.
CHARLIE MEARS.

24:07.707 --> 24:12.059
I'LL ADMIT, YOU'VE GOT
YOUR DETAILS PRETTY DOWN PAT.

24:12.102 --> 24:16.542
NATIONAL FINALIST,
COACH CHARLIE MEARS.

24:16.585 --> 24:18.500
UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOU,

24:18.544 --> 24:20.502
I FOLLOW COLLEGE CHEER.

24:20.546 --> 24:24.506
AND I KNOW YOUR SQUAD
DIDN'T MAKE NATIONALS IN 2017.

24:24.550 --> 24:26.595
DID SOME DIGGING, THOUGH,

24:26.639 --> 24:30.556
AND THERE WAS A
MARINA WINTHROP ON THE TEAM.

24:30.599 --> 24:32.862
WHAT IS THIS?

24:32.906 --> 24:36.126
OH.
UH, THAT WAS JUST, LIKE, THIS MISPRINT THAT HAPPENED.

24:36.170 --> 24:38.302
WHOEVER YOU ARE, YOU'RE
NOT MARINA WINTHROP.

24:38.346 --> 24:41.915
THE DANVERS FOUNDATION.
YEAH, I HAVE FRIENDS OVER THERE,

24:41.958 --> 24:45.092
AND THEY'VE NEVER HEARD
OF YOU BEFORE.

24:45.135 --> 24:47.964
YOUR RESUME IS
A COMPLETE FICTION,

24:48.008 --> 24:50.793
AND I KNOW YOU COULD'VE POSTED
THOSE BORA BORA PHOTOS FROM ANYWHERE.

24:50.837 --> 24:54.362
YOU'RE A FRAUD, A FRAUD
WITH EXPENSIVE TASTE.

24:54.405 --> 24:55.929
AND I KNOW YOU
TOOK THE MONEY.

24:55.972 --> 24:57.539
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

24:57.583 --> 24:59.715
THE MONEY. DUH.

24:59.759 --> 25:01.761
YOU'RE GONNA GET BACK
ON YOUR PHONE

25:01.804 --> 25:03.545
AND DO WHATEVER
YOU NEED TO DO

25:03.589 --> 25:06.417
TO GET EVERY CENT BACK
INTO THE TRUST ACCOUNT,

25:06.461 --> 25:08.289
OR WE'RE CALLING
THE COPS.

25:11.640 --> 25:13.686
NOW.

25:13.729 --> 25:17.037
LAO GONG, ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO DO THIS?

25:17.080 --> 25:19.561
OUR WHOLE LIVES ARE
GOING TO CHANGE.

25:19.605 --> 25:22.259
I KNOW.
IT'S A BIG DECISION.

25:22.303 --> 25:24.740
BUT YOU FEEL YOU HAVE
TO DO IT.

25:24.784 --> 25:26.916
I WON'T DO IT
WITHOUT YOUR BLESSING.

25:26.960 --> 25:28.614
YOU HAVE IT.

25:28.657 --> 25:30.616
OK.

25:32.487 --> 25:34.054
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

25:34.097 --> 25:36.622
I DON'T KNOW.

25:36.665 --> 25:40.582
EVAN'S GONE THROUGH THE
CONTRACT A MILLION TIMES.

25:40.626 --> 25:43.237
HE DOESN'T SEE A WAY OUT.

25:43.280 --> 25:48.198
IF THEY SUE US, WE
COULD LOSE EVERYTHING.

25:48.242 --> 25:51.201
BUT, LAO GONG, I CAN'T.

25:51.245 --> 25:54.465
I JUST CANNOT FIRE SEBASTIAN.

25:55.641 --> 25:58.731
HEY, I'M--I'M GONNA
HAVE TO CALL YOU BACK.

26:04.519 --> 26:05.999
HERE WE GO.

26:32.329 --> 26:34.331
IT'S WORKING.

26:36.899 --> 26:40.686
I'M THERE--IN THE WASTELAND.

26:51.305 --> 26:53.655
I CAN SEE IT, TOO.

27:00.488 --> 27:02.359
HENRY!

27:06.146 --> 27:07.713
I CAN'T FEEL
THE CONNECTION.

27:07.756 --> 27:10.280
I LOST HER.

27:39.962 --> 27:41.747
WHEN I SUBMITTED
YOUR EMPLOYEE INFORMATION

27:41.790 --> 27:43.792
TO CORPORATE, I DIDN'T
THINK IT MATTERED.

27:43.836 --> 27:45.838
YOU KNEW
WHAT YOU WERE DOING,

27:45.881 --> 27:47.709
COVERING FOR ME.

27:49.406 --> 27:50.669
YES.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.716
I SHOULD'VE BEEN
MORE CAREFUL,

27:54.760 --> 27:57.284
BUT I NEED YOU TO KNOW THIS.

27:57.327 --> 28:00.548
I WILL NOT
FIRE YOU, SEBASTIAN.

28:00.591 --> 28:02.550
I DON'T KNOW HOW,
BUT I WILL FIGHT THIS.

28:02.593 --> 28:04.117
WAIT. NO.

28:04.160 --> 28:05.858
NO, YOU WON'T.

28:05.901 --> 28:09.339
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU
DO THAT, MEI-LI.

28:09.383 --> 28:10.732
IT'S NOT JUST ME.

28:10.776 --> 28:12.516
YOU HAVE AN ENTIRE STAFF
OUT THERE.

28:12.560 --> 28:14.083
THEY NEED THIS JOB.

28:14.127 --> 28:16.346
THEY NEED YOU.

28:16.390 --> 28:17.739
SEBASTIAN--

28:17.783 --> 28:21.787
THOSE PEOPLE, THIS FOOD.

28:21.830 --> 28:24.528
I WILL NOT BE THE REASON
YOU LOSE IT ALL.

28:24.572 --> 28:26.966
I REFUSE.

28:27.009 --> 28:30.143
YOUR RESTAURANT MATTERS
TOO MUCH TO ME.

28:35.365 --> 28:36.976
I'LL PACK UP MY KNIVES.

28:37.019 --> 28:38.455
SEBASTIAN.

28:40.196 --> 28:42.938
I DON'T SEE IT AS JUST
MY RESTAURANT, YOU KNOW.

28:42.982 --> 28:45.462
NOT ANYMORE.

28:45.506 --> 28:48.596
THIS PLACE IS OURS.

29:04.220 --> 29:06.962
SHE DID IT.
SHE RETURNED ALL THE MONEY.

29:07.006 --> 29:09.008
SHE WAS SCARED.

29:09.051 --> 29:11.793
I, UH, LIED TO HER WHILE
YOU WERE IN THE BATHROOM,

29:11.837 --> 29:13.969
TOLD HER WE HAD
A SMOKING GUN--

29:14.013 --> 29:15.405
BACKUP SURVEILLANCE
FOOTAGE OF THE THEFT.

29:15.449 --> 29:17.016
SHE FELL FOR IT.

29:17.059 --> 29:18.626
OH, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, ALTHEA,

29:18.669 --> 29:19.975
FOR SAVING ME.

29:20.019 --> 29:21.847
THE MONEY'S BACK.

29:21.890 --> 29:23.152
MY PARENTS DON'T NEED TO KNOW HOW
BIG OF A FAILURE I AM AND--

29:23.196 --> 29:25.024
HEY, HEY, CHLOE...

29:25.067 --> 29:28.027
LOOK, I KNOW YOU
FEEL LIKE

29:28.070 --> 29:29.680
YOU HAVE TO WORK FOR
THE FAMILY TRUST,

29:29.724 --> 29:32.031
BUT IF THIS JOB IS
MAKING YOU FEEL THIS WAY,

29:32.074 --> 29:34.816
YOU CAN MAKE A CHANGE.

29:37.340 --> 29:39.995
I USED TO THINK THAT
TECH WOULD BE MY WHOLE LIFE.

29:40.039 --> 29:42.432
AND DENNIS? YOUR DAD
CUT HIM OFF,

29:42.476 --> 29:43.999
BROKE OFF ALL CONTACT
WITH HIM,

29:44.043 --> 29:45.696
AND HE'S
MAKING IT WORK.

29:45.740 --> 29:47.220
WAIT. IS THAT
WHAT HE TOLD YOU?

29:47.263 --> 29:49.048
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

29:49.091 --> 29:51.746
WHEN THE EARTHQUAKE HAPPENED,
DAD CALLED A TRUCE.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.182
HE OFFERED

29:53.226 --> 29:54.836
HIS OLD JOB, HIS TRUST FUND.

29:54.880 --> 29:57.186
MY PARENTS PRACTICALLY
BEGGED HIM.

29:57.230 --> 29:59.232
DENNIS SAID NO.

30:09.155 --> 30:10.983
WHO ARE YOU?

30:13.115 --> 30:15.378
HURT THE BOY,
AND YOU'RE DEAD.

30:18.599 --> 30:22.298
I'M A WARRIOR. I'M NOT
HERE TO HURT ANYONE.

30:23.996 --> 30:25.693
DID HE FOLLOW YOU HERE?

30:25.736 --> 30:26.912
WHO?

30:26.955 --> 30:29.131
THE HARVESTER.

30:29.175 --> 30:31.786
ZHILAN?

30:34.963 --> 30:36.835
NICKY.

30:38.706 --> 30:40.969
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

30:45.974 --> 30:48.150
YOU CAN REST HERE FOR NOW.

30:48.194 --> 30:50.065
WE'LL GO CHECK
THE OTHER TRAPS.

30:52.851 --> 30:54.722
WHO ARE THEY?

30:56.767 --> 30:59.161
AFTER I LOST MY TRIBE,

30:59.205 --> 31:02.512
I GOT CAUGHT IN
ONE OF HER TRAPS.

31:02.556 --> 31:05.254
SARA USED TO BE A HUNTER
IN A PAST LIFE.

31:05.298 --> 31:08.997
FORTUNATELY,
TIANYU CUT ME DOWN.

31:09.041 --> 31:11.521
I'M NOT THE GAME
THEY'RE AFTER.

31:13.436 --> 31:16.135
YOU STILL HAVEN'T
ANSWERED MY QUESTION.

31:17.832 --> 31:19.921
I CAME HERE
TO DEFEAT HIM,

31:19.965 --> 31:22.141
THIS HARVESTER.

31:22.184 --> 31:24.926
YOU CAME HERE BY CHOICE

31:24.970 --> 31:27.015
TO FIGHT ANOTHER
WORLD'S VILLAIN,

31:27.059 --> 31:27.973
ANOTHER WORLD'S PROBLEM?

31:28.016 --> 31:29.931
WHAT HE'S DOING HERE--

31:29.975 --> 31:32.368
REAPING WARRIOR
AND GUARDIAN SOULS--

31:32.412 --> 31:33.979
IT'S ALL PART OF
A BIGGER PLAN.

31:34.022 --> 31:35.589
STILL, IT'S JUST SO...

31:36.982 --> 31:38.113
YOU.

31:40.550 --> 31:42.726
YOU'LL NEVER DO IT, THOUGH.

31:42.770 --> 31:45.120
THERE'S NO DEFEATING
THE HARVESTER.

31:45.164 --> 31:46.948
BELIEVE ME.
I'VE TRIED.

31:46.992 --> 31:48.950
WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

31:48.994 --> 31:51.953
YOUR SISTER NEEDS US.

31:51.997 --> 31:53.999
WHAT?

31:55.348 --> 31:58.394
PEI-LING IS ALIVE.

32:00.353 --> 32:02.355
HOW?

32:04.226 --> 32:06.054
KIND OF A LONG STORY.

32:12.017 --> 32:14.019
I WONDERED IF I'D
SEE HER HERE,

32:14.062 --> 32:17.022
IF I'D EVER HAVE
THE CHANCE.

32:17.065 --> 32:18.458
THAT'S WHY I CAME.

32:18.501 --> 32:20.416
AND FOR SO LONG,

32:20.460 --> 32:23.028
I DREAMT OF HAVING MORE
TIME WITH PEI-LING, TOO.

32:23.071 --> 32:26.205
SOMEHOW SHE'S BACK.

32:26.248 --> 32:28.990
I HAVE TO HELP HER.

32:29.034 --> 32:31.775
BUT YOU LEFT HER,

32:31.819 --> 32:34.126
AND NOW YOU'RE STUCK HERE.

32:34.169 --> 32:36.302
YEAH.

32:38.913 --> 32:42.221
BUT SINCE I AM,
I HAVE TO DO WHAT I CAN.

32:42.264 --> 32:46.181
STOPPING THE HARVESTER IS THE
ONLY WAY TO PROTECT HER.

32:46.225 --> 32:48.575
MAYBE TOGETHER, WE CAN
ACTUALLY TAKE THIS GUY DOWN.

32:48.618 --> 32:51.839
OK, HENRY GOT ME HERE BY
LOCKING ON TO THE HARVESTER'S BLADES.

32:51.882 --> 32:53.275
HE CAN'T BE FAR.

32:53.319 --> 32:54.276
OH, YOU COULD'VE
MENTIONED THAT EARLIER.

32:54.320 --> 32:56.061
WHAT?

32:56.104 --> 32:57.671
HE'S CLOSE.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

32:57.714 --> 32:59.586
THE HARVESTER, HE IS LETHAL
AND HE IS FAST.

32:59.629 --> 33:01.370
WE HAVE TO GET READY NOW.

33:01.414 --> 33:03.198
WHAT?

33:03.242 --> 33:04.286
NO.

33:04.330 --> 33:06.897
IT'S STUCK.

33:06.941 --> 33:09.030
SOMEONE'S BLOCKED THE DOOR.

33:09.074 --> 33:10.858
WE CAN'T JUST
LEAVE THEM.

33:10.901 --> 33:12.294
AN OFFERING
FOR THE HARVESTER.

33:12.338 --> 33:14.166
BETTER THEM THAN US.

33:14.209 --> 33:16.429
SARA, PLEASE.

33:16.472 --> 33:18.039
WE HAVE TO GO BACK.

33:29.311 --> 33:30.138
COME ON.

33:37.276 --> 33:38.973
TIANYU, THEY'RE NOT
OUR PROBLEM.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.670
NOW, COME ON.
LET'S GO.

33:56.730 --> 33:58.297
HELP US.
I'M TRYING.

33:58.340 --> 34:00.255
IT'S STUCK.

34:00.299 --> 34:02.127
AAH! HE'S COMING.

34:02.170 --> 34:04.042
RUN. SAVE YOURSELF.

34:25.411 --> 34:26.934
NICKY?

34:33.332 --> 34:35.290
HE KNEW MY NAME.

34:35.334 --> 34:38.163
HE DIDN'T FIGHT ME. WHY?

34:39.990 --> 34:42.558
HE'S NOT AFTER THE LIVING.

34:42.602 --> 34:45.039
COME ON.
WE HAVE TO FIND TIANYU.

34:47.389 --> 34:49.304
WAIT. IT'S OK. IT'S JUST US.

34:49.348 --> 34:51.045
WE'VE GOT TO KEEP GOING.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.525
HE NEEDS A SECOND.

34:52.568 --> 34:53.874
PLEASE.

34:56.572 --> 34:59.140
ONE SECOND, THEN WE GO.

35:08.628 --> 35:10.238
WHAT DID YOU MEAN,

35:10.282 --> 35:12.980
THE HARVESTER'S NOT
AFTER THE LIVING?

35:14.329 --> 35:15.852
I THOUGHT YOU WERE...

35:15.896 --> 35:18.725
DEAD? SO DID I.

35:18.768 --> 35:21.771
WHY WOULDN'T HE JUST KILL
US, TAKE OUR SOULS, TOO?

35:23.425 --> 35:24.557
HE'S CLOSE.

35:26.472 --> 35:30.171
SO PROTECT HIM
WITH OUR LIVES?

35:30.215 --> 35:34.219
AND END THE HARVESTER
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

35:43.489 --> 35:45.621
I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING,
PEI-LING.

35:45.665 --> 35:47.319
I'VE TRIED HOMING ON
THE BLADES, THE PENDANT.

35:47.362 --> 35:49.973
NOTHING WORKS.

35:50.017 --> 35:53.281
YOU HAVE NOT
TRIED EVERYTHING.

35:55.283 --> 35:57.503
I KNOW YOU
STILL LOVE HER.

36:00.723 --> 36:04.249
YOU HAVE BEEN SEARCHING
WITH YOUR MIND.

36:04.292 --> 36:08.253
YOU NEED TO LOOK WITH
YOUR HEART.

36:10.733 --> 36:14.433
USE IT, HMM?

36:14.476 --> 36:16.174
EVEN IF IT HURTS.

36:31.754 --> 36:34.104
YOU'RE NOT HURTING HIM.

37:01.393 --> 37:02.437
NO!

37:14.014 --> 37:15.494
MY WORK HERE IS DONE.

37:16.930 --> 37:19.149
I HAVE NO FIGHT WITH YOU.

37:36.166 --> 37:37.690
OH, HI.

37:37.733 --> 37:39.909
HENRY,
THIS IS MY SISTER--NICKY.

37:43.217 --> 37:45.524
I KNOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED,

37:45.567 --> 37:48.788
BUT THAT TRUST,
IT HASN'T GONE AWAY,

37:48.831 --> 37:51.356
NOT FOR ME.

37:51.399 --> 37:55.142
I STILL BELIEVE IN IT.
I STILL BELIEVE IN US.

38:01.714 --> 38:05.326
I WANT TO BE WITH YOU.

38:05.370 --> 38:07.763
YOU'RE MY FUTURE.

38:07.807 --> 38:10.200
I CAN SEE HER.

38:13.943 --> 38:15.249
NICKY!

38:29.307 --> 38:31.787
NICKY.

38:31.831 --> 38:33.485
I CAN'T HOLD IT MUCH LONGER.

38:33.528 --> 38:36.401
DO IT, NICKY.
KILL HIM.

39:41.944 --> 39:44.294
SEB.

39:44.338 --> 39:46.732
WHAT'S WRONG?

40:00.049 --> 40:02.704
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING BECAUSE
THERE WAS NOTHING TO SAY.

40:02.748 --> 40:04.880
I'M NOT GOING BACK
TO THEM.

40:04.924 --> 40:10.669
DENNIS, CHLOE NEEDS YOU.
SHE'S DROWNING.

40:10.712 --> 40:14.455
SHE'S TRYING TO FILL
YOUR SHOES, BUT SHE CAN'T.

40:14.499 --> 40:17.806
I KNOW. THE LAST 4 MONTHS
HAVE BEEN HARD,

40:17.850 --> 40:20.113
BUT I LIKE WHO I AM NOW.

40:20.156 --> 40:22.245
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN MY LIFE,

40:22.289 --> 40:23.595
I'M OUT OF THEIR SHADOWS

40:23.638 --> 40:26.946
AND I'M MAKING A LIVING
FOR MYSELF.

40:26.989 --> 40:30.471
I'M NOT RELYING ON THEIR
MONEY OR THEIR NAME.

40:30.515 --> 40:33.387
I'M JUST AFRAID
IF I GO BACK...

40:33.431 --> 40:34.519
HEY.

40:36.085 --> 40:38.653
I LIKE WHO WE ARE NOW, TOO.

40:38.697 --> 40:41.134
WE DON'T HAVE TO
GIVE THAT UP.

40:41.177 --> 40:45.834
BUT RIGHT NOW,
YOUR FAMILY NEEDS YOU.

40:57.716 --> 40:58.760
NICKY!

41:00.936 --> 41:02.024
YOU DID IT.

41:03.373 --> 41:04.984
HOW?

41:05.027 --> 41:06.768
DID YOU GET HIM?

41:06.812 --> 41:09.510
I--I RAN OUT OF TIME.

41:09.554 --> 41:11.512
I HAD TO MAKE A CHOICE.

41:11.556 --> 41:12.992
PEI-LING?

41:16.386 --> 41:18.519
ZHILAN?

42:05.174 --> 42:06.741
GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD.

42:06.785 --> 42:08.047
NICE SHOT, MOM!
