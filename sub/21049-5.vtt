WEBVTT

00:07.049 --> 00:09.592
Okay, I don't understand.
I'm already dating Darlene.

00:09.676 --> 00:12.137
Why do I have to fuck
or marry or kill anyone?

00:13.012 --> 00:16.099
It's just a game, man.
It's a hypothetical. Watch.

00:16.183 --> 00:19.144
Hey, Colt. Fuck, marry, or kill,
cast of  Fuller House.

00:19.227 --> 00:22.230
Fuck John Stamos, marry Bob Saget,
kill Dave Coulier.

00:24.191 --> 00:27.402
I was talking about the women,
but... that's basically how it goes.

00:28.445 --> 00:30.738
I don't need a hypothetical
to want to kill Bob Saget.

00:30.822 --> 00:33.450
[chuckles] Hey, Mom,
we get a couple beers?

00:34.076 --> 00:37.412
-Of course. How you doing, Berto?
-Oh, doing just fine.

00:37.495 --> 00:39.997
Except my new boss is an asshole.
Hypothetically.

00:40.957 --> 00:42.250
I don't think you understand the game.

00:42.834 --> 00:44.001
Oh, I think I do.

00:45.044 --> 00:46.088
Hey, we're gonna get a table.

00:46.171 --> 00:47.547
-You wanna join us?
-Mmm-hmm.

00:48.590 --> 00:50.800
Mom, if you don't mind,
just throw these on their tab, please.

00:50.883 --> 00:53.220
Their tab. Talk about hypothetical.

00:56.306 --> 00:58.850
-[Abby chuckles]
-How's it goin', fellas?

00:58.933 --> 01:02.895
Dude, work's kickin' my ass.
I cannot wait for the weekend.

01:02.979 --> 01:04.647
Only had time to drink three beers today.

01:04.731 --> 01:05.773
[Rooster sighs]

01:05.857 --> 01:07.442
You had six.

01:07.525 --> 01:09.569
They were light beers.
I was stayin' hydrated.

01:10.528 --> 01:13.323
Ooh, what's Tanya Showers
doin' at the lake?

01:13.406 --> 01:16.118
[Rooster] Oh, shit, man,
she's coverin' the Polar Bear Plunge.

01:16.201 --> 01:17.785
[chuckles] That's awesome.

01:17.869 --> 01:19.787
Every year, she takes off that fur coat,

01:19.871 --> 01:21.664
and she got nothin' on underneath,
but a bikini.

01:22.249 --> 01:23.833
You guys remember 2014?

01:23.916 --> 01:25.543
The white bikini.

01:27.504 --> 01:28.838
It's the Polar Bear Plunge.

01:28.921 --> 01:30.840
Isn't the ice fishin' tournament
the same weekend?

01:30.923 --> 01:32.384
Yeah, I think so.

01:33.092 --> 01:36.763
Shit, we should do it.
We used to own that thing in high school.

01:37.347 --> 01:39.182
We can use my uncle Jimmy's fishin' hut.

01:39.266 --> 01:41.976
I mean, he's not gonna need it
for the next three to five years.

01:42.059 --> 01:43.603
Depending on good behavior.

01:45.104 --> 01:46.814
Remember when you started
that bonfire on the ice?

01:46.898 --> 01:48.900
[chuckles] Oh, man, heat rises.

01:48.983 --> 01:50.943
Yeah, well, our truck sank.

01:52.529 --> 01:55.823
-Hey, can you get off work?
-'Course I can. I'm the fuckin' boss.

01:55.907 --> 01:57.992
Hey, and I go where my fucking boss goes.

01:58.951 --> 02:00.537
Oh, oh, check it out.

02:00.620 --> 02:03.290
-[all] Oh!
-[Abby chuckles]

02:03.956 --> 02:06.334
This is truly
the greatest country in the world.

02:09.171 --> 02:11.173
[theme song playing]

03:11.816 --> 03:15.362
-All right... got a hypothetical for you.
-All right.

03:15.445 --> 03:19.741
Who wins in a fight, Colorado State Ram
or the CU Buffalo?

03:19.824 --> 03:23.203
Oh, those two wouldn't fight.
They're both docile herbivores.

03:23.828 --> 03:26.289
Just quit speaking Spanish
and answer the question.

03:28.207 --> 03:29.334
Hey, guys.

03:29.417 --> 03:31.586
-'Sup, Rich? You know Berto.
-Of course.

03:31.669 --> 03:32.837
-Hey.
-Hey, Berto.

03:32.920 --> 03:36.549
-Catch the Avalanche game the other night?
-Oh, yeah, I'm like you. I love hockey.

03:38.301 --> 03:39.802
[both laugh]

03:42.639 --> 03:45.099
-Goin' fishing?
-Yeah, man, we entered the tournament.

03:45.767 --> 03:48.645
One year, my brother threw up
down the hole... set a record.

03:49.187 --> 03:50.688
Who knew? Trout love vomit.

03:52.649 --> 03:55.151
You know a lot of your stories
involve people throwin' up, right?

03:56.236 --> 03:57.529
I don't think so.

03:58.738 --> 04:00.197
Yeah, maybe most of the good ones.

04:01.699 --> 04:04.160
Listen, we're putting in
a new tracking system for the cows.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.077
Oh, cool.

04:05.161 --> 04:07.705
We need you to tag them,
so we can monitor them electronically.

04:07.789 --> 04:08.623
Okay.

04:08.706 --> 04:11.293
Sorry if that's gonna cut
into your weekend plans.

04:11.376 --> 04:14.296
[chuckles] It's not, man.
Get to it on Monday.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.047
Yeah, the thing is,
they want the new system

04:16.130 --> 04:18.675
up and running by 9:00 a.m. Sunday.

04:19.801 --> 04:23.263
Okay, but between you and me,
I mean, how are they really gonna know?

04:23.346 --> 04:25.222
It's a tracking system.

04:26.974 --> 04:28.100
Right.

04:28.768 --> 04:29.977
You think it'll look suspicious

04:30.061 --> 04:32.314
if all the cows
are at the lake this weekend? [chuckles]

04:33.273 --> 04:36.443
I get it sucks, but it is what it is.

04:36.526 --> 04:37.819
You can go fishing another time.

04:37.902 --> 04:39.321
No, I mean, it's not about the fishing.

04:39.404 --> 04:41.739
It's just, like, Sunday, 9:00 a.m.

04:41.823 --> 04:44.033
I mean, that's just an arbitrary time
and date, am I right?

04:44.116 --> 04:47.244
Yeah. I thought the same thing
when they told me.

04:47.329 --> 04:49.997
Difference is, I thought it.
I didn't say it.

04:50.081 --> 04:53.501
What I said was, was,
"Great, we will get it done."

04:53.585 --> 04:55.920
Guess what I want you
to say to me right now.

04:56.003 --> 04:58.172
Guess what I want to say to you right now.

05:01.008 --> 05:05.805
Look, Rich, you gotta stop questionin'
every move I make, okay?

05:05.888 --> 05:08.224
Now, you want me to ask
my already overworked crew

05:08.308 --> 05:10.393
to work a whole 'nother full day
this weekend?

05:10.477 --> 05:12.979
That's when guys get burned out.
That's when accidents happen.

05:13.062 --> 05:16.524
-You gotta let me do my job.
-Yeah, well, part of the job

05:16.608 --> 05:19.319
is playing ball
with the guy who signs your check.

05:20.862 --> 05:22.238
Okay. Well, what if I say no?

05:22.322 --> 05:25.408
Then... he probably won't sign your check.

05:26.075 --> 05:30.162
[scoffs] Yeah.
All right, fine, I'll get it done.

05:31.122 --> 05:32.457
-Thanks, Rooster.
-Mmm-hmm.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.250
We should grab a beer some night.

05:34.876 --> 05:37.044
Yeah, I'm not much of a drinker, but okay.

05:41.674 --> 05:43.843
All right, I'm headin' out.

05:43.926 --> 05:46.554
What's... Oh, my God!

05:47.514 --> 05:51.934
Is that the finger paintin' I did
in kindergarten with John Elway as my dad?

05:52.018 --> 05:56.063
Oh, and the crepe paper turkey
I made for Thanksgiving.

05:56.147 --> 05:58.190
So great you guys kept all this stuff.

05:58.274 --> 05:59.901
That's the trash pile.

06:03.320 --> 06:06.866
-Wish John Elway was my dad.
-So do I.

06:07.742 --> 06:11.454
-All right, I'll see you later.
-[sniffs] Is that cologne?

06:11.538 --> 06:15.082
Oh, oh, no. Uh, Oil of Olay.
Makes my hands feel like a puppy's ear.

06:16.501 --> 06:18.670
I wish John Elway was your dad, too.

06:24.801 --> 06:29.346
Aw, remember Rooster's macaroni painting
from the fourth grade?

06:31.766 --> 06:35.437
When I was in the fourth grade,
I helped my father dig a well.

06:35.520 --> 06:38.189
Then he left me in it and said,
"Learn how to swim."

06:40.232 --> 06:42.485
Okay, trash pile.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.403
Actually, there's a lot of good stuff
in here

06:44.487 --> 06:46.573
that we could give Colt for the baby.

06:50.868 --> 06:53.538
I wish I had one of those in my size.

07:00.002 --> 07:03.172
I called Jerry to put the bar up for sale.

07:05.382 --> 07:09.804
-So you're really gonna do this?
-Yeah. I'm sick of workin'.

07:10.888 --> 07:12.724
Every night for the past 15 years

07:12.807 --> 07:17.437
I've wiped down the same 12 bar stools,
16 tables and 62 chairs,

07:17.520 --> 07:19.439
and one horrifying urinal.

07:20.690 --> 07:24.777
Guys throw everything in it.
Cigarettes, gum, pennies.

07:24.861 --> 07:26.904
What are they doing,
making a fucking wish?

07:30.492 --> 07:32.368
Never really thought you'd sell the place.

07:33.620 --> 07:38.249
Yeah, well,
I never really thought we'd get divorced.

07:38.332 --> 07:42.504
I never thought Rooster would be working
another ranch. Things change.

07:43.630 --> 07:44.797
Yes, they do.

07:48.760 --> 07:49.969
Yes, they do.

07:53.598 --> 07:57.644
Oh, my God, here's one of those letters
you wrote me when I was off at college.

07:58.603 --> 08:00.563
-God, you kept that?
-'Course I did.

08:00.647 --> 08:02.314
It's evidence you have a heart.

08:03.274 --> 08:04.651
"Dear Maggie,

08:04.734 --> 08:07.695
Patsy Cline came on the radio today,
and I thought of you.

08:08.988 --> 08:12.534
I know you've only been gone a few weeks,
but it feels like forever.

08:13.159 --> 08:15.745
I've taken to growing a mustache.
I'm not sure it suits me.

08:15.828 --> 08:18.164
I'll probably shave it off in a week.

08:19.999 --> 08:22.794
Things back here
aren't the same without you.

08:22.877 --> 08:24.128
Once you get home, I..."

08:24.211 --> 08:26.673
[voice trembles] "...know we'll never
leave each other's side."

08:27.840 --> 08:30.802
Hey, sorry,
probably shouldn't have read that.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.386
No, it was nice.

08:34.430 --> 08:36.223
Let's just open another box.

08:36.307 --> 08:39.143
Actually, maybe we could wait
till tomorrow to continue this.

08:39.226 --> 08:40.477
I gotta be somewhere.

08:41.771 --> 08:45.858
What are you talking about? It's 5:30.
You're gonna be in bed in 90 minutes.

08:47.443 --> 08:48.695
I'm going out to dinner.

08:49.571 --> 08:51.906
-Oh, really? With who?
-A friend.

08:54.241 --> 08:57.203
Okay, your only friends are cows,
and you eat them.

08:58.830 --> 09:00.372
I'm havin' dinner with Brenda.

09:01.415 --> 09:02.792
[Beau clears throat]

09:02.875 --> 09:07.171
Oh. Okay. You're goin' on a date.

09:07.254 --> 09:08.756
No, it's just dinner.

09:09.381 --> 09:12.426
Although we're not eatin'
till eight o'clock, which is ridiculous.

09:12.509 --> 09:14.345
It's not fuckin' New Year's Eve.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.181
Okay, are you gonna dress up?

09:17.765 --> 09:19.726
We're goin' to Charlie's Steakhouse.

09:19.809 --> 09:22.186
So I'll dress up
out of respect for the meat.

09:23.312 --> 09:27.149
So you're going out
with an attractive single woman

09:27.233 --> 09:29.861
who everyone thought
you were sleeping with anyway.

09:30.695 --> 09:31.863
It's a date.

09:31.946 --> 09:36.117
The only thing that's pissing me off
is you won't just say it.

09:37.785 --> 09:41.455
I'm havin' dinner with a friend.
End of story.

09:42.248 --> 09:45.877
Okay. Have fun on your non-date.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.254
I hope you find a shirt
that goes with a porterhouse.

09:48.337 --> 09:50.464
It's not a date.

09:50.547 --> 09:53.175
And every shirt goes with a porterhouse.

09:56.721 --> 09:58.347
-Oh, my phone!
-I'm sorry.

09:58.430 --> 10:00.474
-Fuck, fuck, fuck, how could you do that?
-I'm sorry.

10:00.557 --> 10:03.227
[stammering] My hands were slippery
from my moisturizer.

10:05.021 --> 10:06.773
I mean,
that's what you get for handin' your phone

10:06.856 --> 10:08.816
to a guy who had 117 career fumbles.

10:08.900 --> 10:11.736
Do you just remember my stats
so you can make fun of me for 'em?

10:11.819 --> 10:13.487
Yes, Colt. That's exactly why.

10:15.072 --> 10:18.701
By the way,
I hope we catch 328 fish today.

10:18.785 --> 10:21.704
The exact same number
as your career interceptions.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.874
Maybe a fish will swallow your phone
and we can catch it.

10:24.957 --> 10:26.709
Yeah, maybe.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.922
-[sighs] Oh, guys, I caught another one.
-[Rooster] Oh!

10:31.005 --> 10:32.048
[Abby laughs]

10:32.131 --> 10:33.633
Chug your beers.

10:35.092 --> 10:39.138
That's Abby, seven.
Colt, Rooster, Berto, zero.

10:39.221 --> 10:40.514
[Colt] Oh, whoa, whoa, hold on!

10:40.597 --> 10:43.309
We're on a team.
So that's Colt-Abby, seven.

10:43.392 --> 10:46.145
Same age as Rooster was
when he got out of diapers. [chuckles]

10:46.228 --> 10:47.814
[chuckles]

10:47.897 --> 10:50.900
[sighs] So, uh... I have some news.

10:50.983 --> 10:53.360
-Well, I know it isn't, "I caught a fish."
-[Rooster chuckles]

10:53.444 --> 10:55.655
I bought a home. I am a homeowner.

10:55.738 --> 10:58.115
-[Rooster and Abby] What?
-[Colt] Whoa!

10:58.199 --> 11:01.493
-Man, that's great. Congratulations.
-[Umberto] Thanks.

11:01.577 --> 11:04.831
Couldn't get $20 out of the ATM today,
but that's good for you.

11:04.914 --> 11:05.915
[Abby chuckles]

11:05.998 --> 11:08.500
Dude, we are gonna fuck that shit up
at the housewarming party.

11:08.584 --> 11:09.626
[Umberto chuckles]

11:10.211 --> 11:13.172
Yeah, or instead, you could bring me
a potted plant or a toaster.

11:13.881 --> 11:15.549
This is exciting. Where is it?

11:15.632 --> 11:17.719
Uh, so,
it's in an up-and-coming neighborhood.

11:17.802 --> 11:18.845
You keep driving south,

11:18.928 --> 11:20.722
and when you get the urge
to lock your doors,

11:20.805 --> 11:21.973
uh, well, you're near my house.

11:23.474 --> 11:25.017
[cell phone chiming]

11:25.101 --> 11:27.311
Oh, shit! Is that your phone?

11:27.394 --> 11:30.231
No, mine's on silent.
And it's in the fuckin' lake!

11:32.024 --> 11:33.109
Hello?

11:34.068 --> 11:36.946
Oh, hey, Rich, what's up? [clears throat]

11:37.029 --> 11:39.281
Oh, yeah, just tagging the herd right now.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.533
And... cow number 47.

11:43.160 --> 11:45.537
Oh, you're at the ranch, huh?

11:45.621 --> 11:47.164
You don't see me?

11:47.248 --> 11:48.707
Well, I'm wavin'.

11:50.626 --> 11:53.379
[chuckles] No, I get it, yeah,
I'll get to it on Monday.

11:55.047 --> 11:58.134
Well, that's when I'm gonna do it,
so if you don't like that, too bad.

12:00.594 --> 12:02.471
Okay. [clears throat]

12:05.307 --> 12:07.518
-Who was that? Everything okay?
-[Rooster grunts]

12:07.601 --> 12:10.104
Yeah, yeah. Wrong number.
Hey, who wants a beer? [chuckles]

12:10.187 --> 12:14.441
Oh, yeah. Ah! My moisturizer!

12:18.737 --> 12:20.739
[indistinct chatter]

12:24.493 --> 12:28.622
I think that's the first salad
I've ever seen without any actual salad.

12:29.123 --> 12:30.499
Where are the vegetables?

12:30.582 --> 12:33.961
There's a little potato
underneath the ham and bacon bits.

12:34.753 --> 12:36.047
[laughing]

12:36.922 --> 12:38.966
I'm supposed to be
eating healthier, but...

12:39.758 --> 12:42.553
I'm also supposed
to register all of my guns.

12:45.056 --> 12:48.810
Oh, did you hear about that new
fancy coffee shop over on Euclid?

12:48.893 --> 12:52.563
-Mmm-mmm.
-They charged me $5 for a large coffee.

12:52.646 --> 12:54.606
And there was a tip jar.

12:54.690 --> 12:56.984
I told them, "Fellas, it can't be both."

12:57.068 --> 13:00.112
[chuckles] You know
what kinda coffee I like?

13:00.738 --> 13:01.864
Folgers.

13:02.239 --> 13:05.117
It's instant,
and when you're done with the can,

13:05.201 --> 13:07.244
you can store old batteries in it.

13:09.746 --> 13:11.582
Hey, how's that new collie of yours?

13:12.208 --> 13:13.375
Ah, she's great.

13:14.043 --> 13:17.463
Although, the other day,
she got sprayed by a skunk.

13:17.546 --> 13:21.092
-[chuckles]
-I tried every shampoo in the salon.

13:21.175 --> 13:25.762
Spent a hundred bucks just to make her
smell like a lavender-hibiscus skunk.

13:28.850 --> 13:31.560
There's only one way
to get rid of that smell.

13:31.643 --> 13:34.063
You gotta soak 'em
in a bath of tomato juice,

13:34.146 --> 13:36.482
hydrogen peroxide and dish soap.

13:36.565 --> 13:39.193
-Does that really work?
-Worked on Colt.

13:40.987 --> 13:43.322
I told him not to go
pokin' around in that hole,

13:43.405 --> 13:44.781
but he wouldn't listen.

13:44.866 --> 13:47.159
Well, boys will be boys.

13:47.243 --> 13:48.785
This was last week.

13:48.870 --> 13:50.662
[chuckles]

13:51.873 --> 13:55.209
-You know, I'm glad we finally did this.
-Me, too.

14:08.222 --> 14:11.767
Gallo,  we need to go back
and tag those cows.

14:11.850 --> 14:14.395
It's bureaucratic busywork, all right?

14:14.478 --> 14:16.772
Rich wants us to spend the whole weekend
workin' overtime?

14:16.855 --> 14:20.902
-Fuck that. I take care of my crew.
-Wait, they were gonna pay us overtime?

14:22.904 --> 14:24.238
You should really just go back.

14:24.321 --> 14:28.409
Yeah, we're not gonna win this tournament.
Not with this team of rejects.

14:29.826 --> 14:30.870
[Abby laughs]

14:34.831 --> 14:37.543
Come on, you got work to do,
you got work to do. What's the big deal?

14:38.127 --> 14:39.962
And like I told Rich,
I'll do it on Monday.

14:40.587 --> 14:42.131
Gallo,  I need this job.

14:42.214 --> 14:44.591
I'm gonna have a mortgage.
I'm gonna have a yard.

14:44.675 --> 14:47.553
I promised my cousins they could
have a job taking care of my yard.

14:48.679 --> 14:51.390
Look, as someone who's made
his fair share of mistakes--

14:51.473 --> 14:53.225
Oh, you've made your fair share,
and my share.

14:53.309 --> 14:55.561
Hey, this is about Rooster.

14:55.644 --> 14:57.188
You're not thinking this through.

14:57.271 --> 15:01.025
We... we can go fishin' next weekend.
We can go fishin' any weekend.

15:01.108 --> 15:05.446
Got me doing bullshit paperwork.
Won't let me hire the vet I want to hire.

15:05.529 --> 15:07.448
Now they're tryin' to tell me
how to split my man-hours?

15:07.531 --> 15:12.119
No, fuck that, okay?
My job is to deliver Neumann's Hill

15:12.203 --> 15:14.246
the fattest, healthiest herd
they ever seen.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.665
And when I do that,
none of this other shit's gonna matter.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.045
I expect those assholes
to second-guess everything I do,

15:21.128 --> 15:22.296
but not you guys.

15:25.174 --> 15:28.219
You know what? Fuck this. I'm outta here.

15:28.802 --> 15:30.012
[Abby sighs]

15:35.017 --> 15:38.729
-Colt, you guys need to go talk to him.
-Why? He ain't gonna listen.

15:38.812 --> 15:41.815
He's a stubborn jackass
who always thinks he's right.

15:41.898 --> 15:45.277
He's like my dad with a stupid beard
instead of a kick-ass mustache.

15:46.195 --> 15:47.488
Colt, Abby's right.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.282
If anyone's gonna get through to him,
it's gonna be us.

15:50.366 --> 15:53.327
We're like his brothers.
Well, technically you are his brother,

15:53.410 --> 15:55.955
but he likes me better,
but it doesn't matter.

15:56.038 --> 15:58.540
[groans] Fine, let's go.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.837
All right. [kisses]

16:03.920 --> 16:07.216
-I'll call you later.
-Will ya? How?

16:08.300 --> 16:10.636
Come on. Here, take my phone.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.472
See? That's how it's done, jackass.

16:15.224 --> 16:16.350
I love you.

16:17.268 --> 16:18.269
Love you.

16:31.657 --> 16:35.161
-Tanya Showers?
-Oh, sorry. Wrong hut.

16:35.244 --> 16:36.578
Is it?

16:47.214 --> 16:51.510
-I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable.
-You didn't make me uncomfortable.

16:53.345 --> 16:58.434
What made me uncomfortable was that
waiter tellin' me I made a good choice,

16:58.517 --> 17:00.936
like I needed his approval.
[chuckles lightly]

17:03.147 --> 17:04.398
Come on, Beau.

17:05.607 --> 17:06.817
You disappeared.

17:07.651 --> 17:09.445
I haven't done this in 40 years.

17:10.821 --> 17:13.240
Even back then I wasn't very good at it.

17:13.324 --> 17:16.868
It requires small talk,
and I hate small talk.

17:17.869 --> 17:20.539
By the way, can you believe this weather?

17:23.459 --> 17:25.877
-Were you thinkin' about Maggie?
-No.

17:27.463 --> 17:29.923
-That's over.
-It's okay, Beau.

17:30.716 --> 17:32.134
You were together a long time.

17:32.218 --> 17:35.262
It's been years since Jim passed
and he's still on my mind.

17:36.347 --> 17:40.476
Just the other day,
I was cleanin' out the garage, and...

17:40.559 --> 17:43.854
I found an old T-shirt of his
that he'd worn on our honeymoon.

17:45.147 --> 17:48.650
And I smelled it
just to bring him back, I guess.

17:49.568 --> 17:53.364
Forgot that we'd turned it
into an old turpentine rag.

17:53.447 --> 17:55.657
-Almost passed out.
-[Beau chuckles]

17:56.867 --> 17:59.328
I love the smell of turpentine.

18:01.788 --> 18:05.792
If you are not ready to do this,
it's okay.

18:06.877 --> 18:09.588
It's not that I don't enjoy
being with you.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.424
And I enjoy being with you, too.

18:13.134 --> 18:16.095
Doesn't usually take me two hours
to cut somebody's hair.

18:16.637 --> 18:19.848
I thought you were just anglin'
for a bigger tip,

18:19.931 --> 18:22.101
like Mr. Good Choice over there.

18:26.397 --> 18:28.190
I think I just need a little time.

18:30.066 --> 18:31.277
Tell you what.

18:32.319 --> 18:36.490
Whenever you are ready,
you just come on in for another haircut.

18:37.741 --> 18:40.994
But if it only takes me ten minutes,
you know I'm seeing somebody else.

18:42.913 --> 18:43.955
Deal.

18:45.291 --> 18:46.625
All right, but just so you know,

18:46.708 --> 18:48.419
you are not gettin' out
of buyin' me dinner.

18:48.502 --> 18:49.628
Don't worry.

18:49.711 --> 18:52.714
It's not in my nature
to deny someone a steak.

18:54.591 --> 18:55.926
Thank you, Beau.

19:01.765 --> 19:03.225
I'm just fuckin' with ya.

19:09.898 --> 19:14.570
Oh. See? Told you he'd be here.
Only bar within 50 miles.

19:14.653 --> 19:18.073
Yeah, well, I've never said this before,
but you are a smart man, Colt.

19:18.990 --> 19:21.285
-'Sup, dipshit?
-[Umberto sighs]

19:21.368 --> 19:23.620
Shouldn't you be back on the ranch
tagging some cows?

19:23.704 --> 19:26.290
Yeah, I care about you too much
to leave you here.

19:26.373 --> 19:28.584
Also, I don't have
a ride back to the ranch.

19:29.668 --> 19:32.338
Well, I ain't goin' back to a place
that don't appreciate me.

19:32.421 --> 19:35.674
Yeah, they're doing nothin'
to show you they appreciate ya.

19:35.757 --> 19:38.594
What with that new truck,
and that huge old salary.

19:38.677 --> 19:41.180
Every Neumann's Hill rancher
gets the same shit.

19:41.263 --> 19:43.807
Yeah, well, my salary
is whatever I can fish out of Dad's wallet

19:43.890 --> 19:46.142
when he falls asleep
during a  Blue Bloods  marathon.

19:46.977 --> 19:49.896
So what, dude?
You're working for dad for a few months.

19:49.980 --> 19:52.148
Been payin' my dues for 15 years.

19:52.733 --> 19:55.319
I deserve some respect, all right?
I'm a great fuckin' rancher.

19:55.402 --> 19:56.487
Wow. [scoffs]

19:56.570 --> 19:59.740
You're extremely full of yourself.
Is this, like, a family thing?

19:59.823 --> 20:01.658
Because you thought
you were very good at football.

20:02.951 --> 20:03.994
I was good at football.

20:04.077 --> 20:05.704
Rooster, how many career touchdowns
did I have?

20:05.787 --> 20:07.038
How the fuck should I know?

20:07.956 --> 20:11.335
If Neumann's Hill didn't trust you,
they wouldn't have put you in charge.

20:12.794 --> 20:15.381
You're pissin' away an opportunity
most people would kill for.

20:15.464 --> 20:17.591
[scoffs] Really?

20:17.674 --> 20:19.718
You're gonna preach to me
about pissin' away opportunities?

20:20.677 --> 20:22.471
You literally pissed
on an assistant coach.

20:22.554 --> 20:26.225
No, no, no.
I spilled pee on an assistant coach.

20:26.975 --> 20:29.311
I was carrying a clean urine sample
for a drug test.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.563
And I just happened to trip
'cause I was drunk.

20:33.690 --> 20:35.984
Whatever.
I'm not takin' advice from a fuck-up.

20:36.067 --> 20:38.529
Oh, I'm a fuck-up? [scoffs] Fuck you.

20:39.946 --> 20:42.699
Man, my brother Raul and I
used to fight all the time.

20:43.242 --> 20:46.411
We had this  Amazing Spider-Man  pillow
that we both liked to sleep with.

20:47.579 --> 20:50.874
One night, he said it was his turn,
I said it was mine...

20:51.458 --> 20:53.710
and he took both of his thumbs
and pressed them against my eyes,

20:53.794 --> 20:57.589
trying to gouge them out.
[chuckling] Kids.

20:58.340 --> 21:00.884
Whatever.
If he wants to ruin his life, let him.

21:02.135 --> 21:05.389
Get the fuck off me, bro.
What? You want some of the Rooster?

21:05.472 --> 21:06.848
Ah, shit.

21:08.850 --> 21:10.686
Cover your eyes, motherfucker!

21:15.357 --> 21:16.191
Hey.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.068
[soft music playing]

21:18.151 --> 21:19.194
Hey.

21:20.612 --> 21:22.489
How was your "not a date"?

21:23.073 --> 21:25.909
Well, it was interesting.

21:27.953 --> 21:31.998
I'm sittin' there at a place where you
and I have been a thousand times before,

21:33.375 --> 21:37.671
and I'm thinkin' about how you always
ordered the rib eye and a salad.

21:39.548 --> 21:43.802
But you didn't want the mashed potatoes,
so I'd order double...

21:44.720 --> 21:47.764
'cause when the food came,
you'd always eat half of mine.

21:50.726 --> 21:52.769
I didn't do that every time.

21:53.437 --> 21:55.647
No. Sometimes you ate all the potatoes.

21:59.443 --> 22:00.444
[Maggie sighs]

22:00.527 --> 22:05.073
Point is... I had a good time with Brenda.

22:06.367 --> 22:09.453
She's smart, she's funny,
she's good-lookin'.

22:11.204 --> 22:13.164
But she's not you.

22:15.542 --> 22:16.835
Not me?

22:17.794 --> 22:20.589
So what do you mean,
I'm none of those things?

22:21.715 --> 22:23.174
You're all of those things.

22:24.426 --> 22:25.511
And more.

22:29.390 --> 22:30.766

22:40.358 --> 22:42.736
How am I supposed to be with anybody else?

22:44.446 --> 22:47.866
Beau, you gotta stop
looking back at the last 40,

22:47.949 --> 22:50.661
and start looking ahead at the next 20.

22:50.744 --> 22:55.206
Oh, good God,
I can't do this for another 20 years.

22:56.750 --> 22:59.252
You're just better
at this stuff than I am, Maggie.

22:59.335 --> 23:03.339
No, I am not.
I have no idea what I'm doing.

23:04.132 --> 23:06.301

In six months,
it'll be easier than it is today.

23:12.933 --> 23:14.476
And six months after that, who knows,

23:14.560 --> 23:17.646
maybe I'll be introducing you
to my new boyfriend.

23:18.814 --> 23:21.733

26:26.627 --> 26:28.837
See how funny it is
when I knock out your fuckin' teeth."

26:30.380 --> 26:33.466
I hope his buddy was a racist, too,
'cause I beat the shit out of him.

26:33.549 --> 26:35.593
-[chuckles] Yeah, you did.
-[Colt chuckles]

26:37.053 --> 26:39.931
-'Sup, Berto?
-Hey! [grunts]

26:40.766 --> 26:43.852
What'd you do for your mugshot?
I went 007.

26:44.686 --> 26:46.855
Oh, oh, oh! I went double bird. [chuckles]

26:48.606 --> 26:50.817
Oh, I reflected on all my bad decisions.

26:52.193 --> 26:53.486
That's one way to go.

26:55.781 --> 26:57.991
Hey, don't worry
about them cows, all right?

26:58.074 --> 26:59.409
We'll tag 'em when we get outta here.

27:01.202 --> 27:03.246
-[sighs] Fellas.
-Hey.

27:03.329 --> 27:05.206
-Beer Pong! What happened to your arm?
-What's up, boss?

27:05.290 --> 27:06.833
Hurt it in a police chase.

27:06.917 --> 27:10.045
Oh, shit! Was it like a bank robbery,
or a drug raid, or somethin'?

27:10.128 --> 27:11.713
Sort of. [sighs]

27:11.797 --> 27:14.424
I found some teenagers in the park
drinking beer.

27:14.507 --> 27:16.467
Chased them
and tripped over a teeter-totter.

27:18.594 --> 27:21.097
Listen,
Berto's in a little bit of trouble.

27:23.224 --> 27:26.144
-What's goin' on?
-He's being deported.

27:28.646 --> 27:29.981
You're illegal?

27:31.232 --> 27:32.483
Why didn't you tell us?

27:33.735 --> 27:35.111
There's no upside to it.

27:36.822 --> 27:38.949
Gallo,  we live in fear every day.

27:39.032 --> 27:42.786
You know, five miles over the speed limit,
and it could ruin our life.

27:42.869 --> 27:44.871
Why would I wanna put that on you, too?

27:46.873 --> 27:48.416
'Cause we're your friends.

27:49.375 --> 27:52.170
Yeah. Plus this whole time I just thought
you drove like a pussy.

27:53.629 --> 27:55.799
I'm sorry, Berto. It's out of my hands.

27:59.803 --> 28:02.764
No. No, this is... this is bullshit.

28:03.348 --> 28:06.392
You wanna take someone, you should take
them assholes from down at the bar.

28:06.476 --> 28:08.103
Colt. Colt.

28:11.106 --> 28:12.440
I understand.

28:13.399 --> 28:14.860
No, no! Fuck this.

28:14.943 --> 28:16.987
You're gonna take him,
you're takin' me, too.

28:17.070 --> 28:18.780
Yeah, and you're takin' me, too.

28:18.864 --> 28:21.282
I mean, I guess I can.

28:21.366 --> 28:23.910
They don't really care
who goes in that direction.

28:25.661 --> 28:29.082
Guys, guys. It's... [chuckles]
It's okay. Come here.

28:30.751 --> 28:33.128
I knew this could happen one day.

28:33.837 --> 28:36.256
Yeah. I will see you guys again.

28:40.093 --> 28:45.598
And, uh... you guys were more brothers
to me than Raul ever was.

28:49.853 --> 28:50.937
I'm sorry.

29:00.446 --> 29:01.531
Fuck.

29:03.116 --> 29:05.285
