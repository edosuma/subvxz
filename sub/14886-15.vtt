Fine.

Yes, it's a real

You know, because
in just one minute, I was gonna

...why are you

02:33.319 --> 02:34.555
Interesting question.

02:34.588 --> 02:37.558
Because I need more

11:31.324 --> 11:33.059
In.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.728
Out.

11:34.761 --> 11:36.196
Up.

11:36.229 --> 11:37.898
Down.

11:37.931 --> 11:38.865
I like this game.

11:40.767 --> 11:42.168
I'm glad.

11:43.403 --> 11:44.437
Black.

11:44.470 --> 11:45.872
White.

11:45.906 --> 11:47.841
‐ Short.
‐ Tall.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.475
‐ Door.
‐ Eggs.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.013
"Eggs?"

11:54.380 --> 11:54.915
Chicken.

11:57.350 --> 11:59.152
No, no,
I say "door"

11:59.185 --> 12:00.521
and the first thing
you think of is "eggs?"

12:00.554 --> 12:02.022
‐ Right.
‐ Wrong.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.757
You're good at it too!

12:05.826 --> 12:09.195
No. No. That makes no sense.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.231
To say "eggs" after
I say "door."

12:11.264 --> 12:14.535
Well, of course it does.
Don't be ridiculous.

12:14.568 --> 12:18.204
When you say "door," I remember
the time that Uncle Stavros

12:18.238 --> 12:21.041
closed Aunt Sophia's
hand in the door

12:21.074 --> 12:24.010
and we had to take her to the
doctor and he charged us so much

12:24.044 --> 12:25.779
of money to fix up her

12:25.812 --> 12:27.147
that we can't pay it

12:27.180 --> 12:29.282
and we had to
give him one dozen eggs

12:29.315 --> 12:32.385
from their hen Hilda
every week for a year.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.354
So you see it
makes perfect sense

12:34.387 --> 12:36.156
and don't you feel
just a little bit stupid?

12:39.025 --> 12:40.060
That's it.
I'm out of here.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.929
No, no.
No. No, I'll be good.

12:42.963 --> 12:45.165
Alright, alright, alright.

12:45.198 --> 12:49.135
Alright. Well, we'll have
to try something else.

12:49.169 --> 12:51.471
In college we had an exercise

12:51.505 --> 12:54.575
where we went back
into the dream state.

12:54.608 --> 12:56.109
Would that be New Jersey?

13:00.313 --> 13:03.249
No. No, that's
the garden state.

13:05.451 --> 13:08.522
Now this exercise let's you..

13:08.555 --> 13:10.991
...let's you relive your dream.

13:11.024 --> 13:12.559
Alright.

13:12.593 --> 13:18.131
Now, I want you to clear
every thought from your head.

13:18.164 --> 13:19.933
I know it's not easy.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.067
But you have to concentrate.

13:21.101 --> 13:23.036
No, I did it.
My mind is empty.

13:31.945 --> 13:36.049
Alright. Going back
into your dream.

13:36.082 --> 13:37.918
Tell me what you see?

13:37.951 --> 13:40.521
I see little white cars.

13:40.554 --> 13:42.422
What are they doing?

13:42.455 --> 13:46.326
They're...they're
coming toward me.

13:46.359 --> 13:49.362
They're, um, they're, they're

13:49.395 --> 13:50.997
engines are roaring
like thunder.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.298
Uh‐huh.

13:52.332 --> 13:57.370
And...I want to run,
but I can't move

13:57.403 --> 14:01.107
and they're
coming closer to me

14:01.141 --> 14:03.343
and I think they're
going to crush me.

14:03.376 --> 14:05.245
Alright, Balki, Balki, Balki.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.615
[sighs]

14:08.649 --> 14:12.118
Whoa, baby.

14:12.152 --> 14:15.522
We should've gone
to New Jersey.

14:15.556 --> 14:20.160
Alright. I think
we know what woke you up.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.162
Have you had the same dream
for the past few nights?

14:22.195 --> 14:24.330
‐ I think so.
‐ Uh‐huh.

14:24.364 --> 14:28.935
Well, Balki, the only way
to get rid of this nightmare..

14:28.969 --> 14:30.236
...is to figure out
what it means.

14:30.270 --> 14:31.271
Now we're gonna have
to talk about it.

14:31.304 --> 14:32.573
Oh, no. We're not.

14:32.606 --> 14:34.240
‐ Yes we‐‐
‐ Oh!

14:34.274 --> 14:35.576
‐ Yes we‐‐
‐ Oh, no, no, no.

14:35.609 --> 14:38.679
Balki, we're going to have
to talk about your dream.

14:38.712 --> 14:41.147
Cousin, before I talk
about that dream again

14:41.181 --> 14:43.083
it'll be a cold
day in December.

14:46.452 --> 14:48.955
[instrumental music]

14:56.462 --> 14:59.966
(Larry)
'Balki, you got to tell
us about your dream.'

15:00.000 --> 15:04.204
‐ Who wants more popcorn?
‐ Nobody wants popcorn.

15:04.237 --> 15:09.576
Now, Balki, was this dream
in black and white or color?

15:09.610 --> 15:12.946
I'll make hot chocolate.
Everybody likes that.

15:12.979 --> 15:14.114
This is fun.

15:14.147 --> 15:16.249
I've never been to a dream
interpretation party before.

15:21.154 --> 15:22.956
You know, Larry,
I get the feeling

15:22.989 --> 15:25.992
Balki doesn't want
to talk about this.

15:26.026 --> 15:29.362
Balki, it's 3 a. m.

15:29.395 --> 15:31.732
We have to solve
your problem.

15:31.765 --> 15:35.235
You can't let this nightmare
take over your life.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.604
Cousin, I don't
want to talk about it.

15:37.638 --> 15:39.439
Balki, everybody
has nightmares.

15:39.472 --> 15:41.474
They're nothing
to be afraid off.

15:41.508 --> 15:45.011
Dreams are nothing more than
windows to our subconscious.

15:45.045 --> 15:47.247
It should be open to let
in the fresh air of reason.

15:55.756 --> 15:58.692
Mary Anne, did you
just read that?

15:58.725 --> 16:01.127
No. Sometimes late at night
I start to make sense.

16:06.032 --> 16:07.133
Scary, huh?

16:11.137 --> 16:12.305
Look, guys,
it's really late.

16:12.338 --> 16:14.107
We've to get up
for an early flight.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.441
Yeah, and if we
don't get some sleep

16:15.475 --> 16:17.744
we'll wind up spilling
things on the passengers.

16:17.778 --> 16:19.179
They hate that.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.184
Thanks for trying to help.

16:24.217 --> 16:26.019
‐ Good luck, Balki.
‐ Pleasant dreams.

16:28.789 --> 16:30.223
Sorry.

16:30.256 --> 16:31.792
Come on, Mary Anne

16:31.825 --> 16:34.260
Goodnight, Jennifer.

16:34.294 --> 16:35.461
‐ Goodnight.
‐ Yeah.

16:38.264 --> 16:40.266
Wait, what do you want to do?

16:40.300 --> 16:42.402
Go to an all‐night movie?

16:42.435 --> 16:44.605
Balki, we have to find
out what your dream means

16:44.638 --> 16:46.039
so we both can
get some sleep.

16:46.072 --> 16:48.709
Cousin, I don't want
to talk about it.

16:48.742 --> 16:50.511
Well, you've got
to talk about it.

16:50.544 --> 16:51.578
Well, you can't make me.
I'm leaving.

16:51.612 --> 16:54.447
Alright. Alright,
I'll figure it out <i>myself.</i>

17:03.757 --> 17:08.094
Ah‐hah! Oh, well..

17:08.127 --> 17:11.131
Yes, that's something..

17:15.536 --> 17:17.470
Mm‐mm‐mm.

17:23.544 --> 17:25.646
Cousin, I want to see the book.

17:25.679 --> 17:26.847
‐ No.
‐ I want to see the book.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.515
‐ No. You can't see the book.
‐ I want to see the book.

17:28.549 --> 17:29.516
No. You can't
see the book.

17:29.550 --> 17:31.451
Oh, alright.

17:33.219 --> 17:36.089
Alright, you
can see the book.

17:36.122 --> 17:37.290
But only if you
answer one question.

17:37.323 --> 17:38.525
Okay.

17:38.559 --> 17:40.561
Where are the cars
in your dream going?

17:40.594 --> 17:43.429
I...into a big garage.

17:43.463 --> 17:45.431
‐ Now give me the book.
‐ Not yet.

17:45.465 --> 17:47.200
Why are they
going there?

17:47.233 --> 17:48.569
I don't know why
they're going to the barn.

17:48.602 --> 17:49.570
Let me see the book.

17:49.603 --> 17:51.738
Balki, you said barn.

17:51.772 --> 17:53.674
Not garage.

17:53.707 --> 17:55.709
Now, that is a big breakthrough.
We're on to something.

17:55.742 --> 17:56.510
Do you realize
what this means?

17:56.543 --> 17:58.545
You're not going
to give me the book.

17:58.579 --> 18:00.714
Alright.
They're going into a barn.

18:00.747 --> 18:03.216
Now cars don't belong
in a barn, animals do.

18:03.249 --> 18:06.219
Maybe the cars represent
some kind of animals.

18:06.252 --> 18:09.623
‐ Uh, rabbits, cats, dogs‐‐
‐ Sheep?

18:09.656 --> 18:11.692
No, no, no. It would have
to be some kind of farm animal.

18:11.725 --> 18:14.260
‐ Uh, horses, uh..
‐ Sheep.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.563
I got it...cows!

18:16.597 --> 18:19.299
‐ Sheep.
‐ Sheep! Yes, yes.

18:19.332 --> 18:20.266
Sheep!

18:22.402 --> 18:24.337
But why would you
be afraid of sheep?

18:24.370 --> 18:26.372
I don't know.
I love sheep.

18:26.406 --> 18:30.176
Sheep are man's best friend.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.813
Maybe you only
think you love sheep

18:32.846 --> 18:35.248
but actually you're
jealous of all the attention

18:35.281 --> 18:36.149
your parents
gave the sheep.

18:36.182 --> 18:38.652
What do you think?

18:38.685 --> 18:39.419
Uh, no.

18:41.622 --> 18:43.256
They treated
us all equally.

18:45.826 --> 18:48.161
Well, why would you be
dreaming of sheep now?

18:49.963 --> 18:51.898
It's bopoltide!

18:51.932 --> 18:54.300
‐ Ah!
‐ Ah.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.236
Oh.

18:56.269 --> 18:58.572
What's bopoltide?

18:58.605 --> 19:01.608
Well, um, it's
the time of the year

19:01.642 --> 19:04.410
uh, when all
the Mypiot people

19:04.444 --> 19:08.815
shear off the wool of
the sheep to sell to get money.

19:08.849 --> 19:12.686
And, uh, my mother and father
and the whole family get up

19:12.719 --> 19:16.690
very early because
the wool buyer comes to Mypos

19:16.723 --> 19:19.960
for only one day and, uh,
if the wool is not ready

19:19.993 --> 19:23.329
when he come
to the door, then he goes right

19:23.363 --> 19:26.733
to the next farm and we don't
have any money to buy food.

19:26.767 --> 19:31.538
And, uh, my mama and papa
and the whole family..

19:31.572 --> 19:37.410
...they work very hard,
but I'm not there to help them

19:37.443 --> 19:41.982
and, uh, maybe, maybe they
don't finish in time and then

19:42.015 --> 19:45.218
and then maybe..

19:45.251 --> 19:47.353
...they're hungry.

19:47.387 --> 19:48.922
And it's...my fault.

19:51.625 --> 19:55.696
Balki, that's why
you're having your dream.

19:55.729 --> 19:56.930
You think you're
letting them down.

19:56.963 --> 19:59.833
You feel guilty.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.334
Balki, it's
gonna be alright.

20:01.367 --> 20:02.736
No, cousin.
I don't see how.

20:02.769 --> 20:04.270
Well, you'll call.

20:04.304 --> 20:07.407
You'll tell them you're
sorry, you can't be there.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.576
Well, it must be
daytime there now, right?

20:09.610 --> 20:11.011
Come on.
You'll make the call.

20:11.044 --> 20:14.915
Cousin, already they're
tired from too much working

20:14.948 --> 20:17.383
and they have only
one phone on Mypos

20:17.417 --> 20:19.485
and it's way the other
side of the island.

20:19.520 --> 20:22.455
And after they get
the messenger pigeon

20:22.488 --> 20:24.558
they have to..

20:24.591 --> 20:25.826
...they have to pack a lunch

20:25.859 --> 20:27.661
they have to get
into the ox cart

20:27.694 --> 20:29.930
and then have to drive
many, many miles

20:29.963 --> 20:31.965
to get to the phone booth.

20:34.067 --> 20:36.436
One phone?

20:36.469 --> 20:38.338
Well, yes,
but it has call waiting.

20:44.377 --> 20:46.446
I'll place the call.

20:46.479 --> 20:49.415
[instrumental music]

20:52.519 --> 20:54.287
Mama.

20:54.320 --> 20:55.856
[speaking in foreign language]

21:00.393 --> 21:01.361
What? What? What?

21:01.394 --> 21:03.429
I‐I told mama that I feel bad

21:03.463 --> 21:05.331
because I can't be there
to help with the sheep shearing.

21:05.365 --> 21:06.366
‐ 'Balki.'
‐ Oh!

21:09.035 --> 21:11.772
[speaking in foreign language]

21:21.347 --> 21:22.716
What? What?

21:22.749 --> 21:24.551
Mama said that they
bought an electric sheepshearer

21:24.585 --> 21:26.052
with the money I sent.

21:26.086 --> 21:26.887
‐ 'Balki.'
‐ Oh!

21:30.557 --> 21:33.493
[speaking in foreign language]

21:44.004 --> 21:45.005
What? What?

21:45.038 --> 21:47.473
And she said that it
did the work in half the time

21:47.508 --> 21:49.876
and they're so happy,
they had a big celebration.

21:49.910 --> 21:50.777
‐ 'Balki.'
‐ Oh!

21:54.380 --> 21:55.916
[speaking in foreign language]

22:14.701 --> 22:15.636
Bye, mama.

22:31.117 --> 22:31.952
You alright?

22:34.855 --> 22:35.789
Yes.

22:39.726 --> 22:45.866
Cousin, what do you call when
something squeeze your heart

22:45.899 --> 22:48.468
and make you wish
you were with your family?

22:49.770 --> 22:52.673
Oh, that's called
being homesick.

22:52.706 --> 22:56.042
Hey, Balki, it's, it's perfectly
natural to miss your family

22:56.076 --> 22:57.177
and want to be with them.

22:57.210 --> 23:01.715
Well, most of the time,
I'm very happy that I come here.

23:01.748 --> 23:04.585
You are a good
family to me.

23:04.618 --> 23:08.488
But once in a while,
when I know that my Mypos family

23:08.522 --> 23:14.928
is all together, then...I wish
I was in my chair at the table.

23:14.961 --> 23:19.833
Because papa sits here
and Uncle Stavros sits there

23:19.866 --> 23:23.904
and...it's a place
of honor, you know.

23:23.937 --> 23:26.840
Well, maybe you
should call home more often.

23:26.873 --> 23:28.909
Hmm.

23:28.942 --> 23:30.611
It won't be like
being in your chair

23:30.644 --> 23:33.146
but at least you'll
hear their voices.

23:33.179 --> 23:35.582
I think you're right.

23:35.616 --> 23:39.152
Cousin, I'm very sorry that
I made so much trouble for you.

23:39.185 --> 23:41.788
Now, don't be silly.
I was worried about you.

23:43.690 --> 23:47.160
You know, I'm glad you made me
look Mr. Fear right in the face.

23:47.193 --> 23:49.696
He's not so bad when you
realize he's just a sheep.

23:51.932 --> 23:54.167
Well, I know you'd
do the same for me.
