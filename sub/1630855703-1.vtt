WEBVTT

00:59.977 --> 01:03.313
Today is gonna be
the best day ever.

01:03.313 --> 01:04.815
How do I know that?

01:04.815 --> 01:06.650
Because every day
is the best day ever.

01:06.650 --> 01:08.735
I love my life.

01:08.735 --> 01:11.947
I love sunshine,
I love butterflies,

01:11.947 --> 01:16.243
but more than anything,
I love Doug.

01:16.243 --> 01:18.412
- Hey!

01:18.412 --> 01:20.247
Shut the fuck up.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.416
Fucking piece of shit.

01:22.416 --> 01:24.751
That's Doug, also known as

01:24.751 --> 01:26.503
the best owner in the world.

01:28.463 --> 01:31.216
I still remember
the first day we met.

01:31.216 --> 01:33.844
She was, too, flirting
with you. -

01:33.844 --> 01:36.179
Hey, babies.

01:36.179 --> 01:38.890
The second Doug laid eyes on me,

01:38.890 --> 01:41.226
we knew we were meant
to be together.

01:41.226 --> 01:42.894
Fuck.

01:42.894 --> 01:46.273
Ever since that day,
he and I have been inseparable.

01:47.065 --> 01:48.775
Why is Doug so great?

01:48.775 --> 01:50.193
- Where do I begin?
- Get down.

01:50.193 --> 01:52.571
He loves being around me
so much,

01:52.571 --> 01:54.781
he doesn't even have a job.

01:55.991 --> 01:58.702
Also, Doug doesn't get me
boring dog toys.

01:58.702 --> 02:00.829
He lets me come up
with my own toys.

02:00.829 --> 02:02.247
Hi, Reggie. What you got?

02:02.247 --> 02:04.458
Like this stretchy thing.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.793
- What the fuck?
- Uh...

02:06.793 --> 02:07.919
Those aren't mine.

02:07.919 --> 02:09.796
There is a simple explanation.

02:09.796 --> 02:11.381
This was supposed to be
a Christmas present.

02:11.381 --> 02:12.549
Doug, it's July.

02:12.549 --> 02:14.051
Sometimes I worry

02:14.051 --> 02:15.969
if I'm doing a good job
making Doug happy.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.721
- You don't get it.
- I'm done. Reggie.

02:17.721 --> 02:19.806
But then I realized
I do make Doug happy.

02:19.806 --> 02:22.142
What are you doing?
You don't even like the dog.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.144
I love this dog.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.729
And that makes me happy.

02:25.729 --> 02:28.482
-All that matters
is that you like him,

02:28.482 --> 02:30.734
and I like that
you don't get to have him.

02:30.734 --> 02:33.612
You are a total fucking loser.

02:33.612 --> 02:35.822
- Yeah, a loser with a dog.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.658
Honestly,
the only thing in the world

02:38.658 --> 02:41.370
that Doug maybe loves
more than me

02:41.370 --> 02:44.373
is his favorite toy: his penis.

02:44.373 --> 02:46.166
He gives it haircuts.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.626
He watches TV with it.

02:47.626 --> 02:49.336
WOMAN
Flip it around!

02:49.336 --> 02:50.587
Stop staring. You're ruining it.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.631
And the way he pets that thing,

02:52.631 --> 02:55.258
sometimes I wish I was a penis.

02:55.258 --> 02:56.843
But every time
I try to play with it,

02:56.843 --> 02:58.678
he gets so possessive.

02:58.678 --> 03:00.180
Get off! Get-- Bad dog!

03:00.180 --> 03:01.890
The key to any good relationship

03:01.890 --> 03:03.266
is having things in common.

03:03.266 --> 03:04.518
We both like barking.

03:08.105 --> 03:10.148
We both love a good scratch.

03:13.902 --> 03:18.657
And we can stay up all night
just talking for hours.

03:19.991 --> 03:21.952
You fucked up my life,
didn't you?

03:21.952 --> 03:24.204
Even though I don't
understand what he's saying...

03:24.204 --> 03:28.208
She never would've found out
if it wasn't for your dumb ass.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.544
...I can tell he loves me.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.382
And while I don't know
that many human beings,

03:35.382 --> 03:38.301
I think it's safe to assume
he's one of the best.

03:38.301 --> 03:40.429
Goddamn it.

03:40.429 --> 03:41.930
It's bullshit, Mom.

03:41.930 --> 03:43.390
They're kicking me out

03:43.390 --> 03:45.142
'cause your last check
wasn't enough for rent.

03:45.142 --> 03:47.310
You might say
Doug is messy, but lately...

03:47.310 --> 03:49.312
No, I'm not gonna
move back home.

03:49.312 --> 03:50.689
...he's been much better

03:50.689 --> 03:52.023
at putting his toys away.

03:52.023 --> 03:53.483
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Look.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.026
It's just, you know that I can't

03:55.026 --> 03:57.237
live that close to a school.

03:58.196 --> 04:00.323
No!

04:03.577 --> 04:07.497
Bad dog! That's my favorite
fucking bong, dude!

04:13.336 --> 04:16.631
Oh. You like that ball,
don't you?

04:17.883 --> 04:19.676
Lately, Doug has been playing

04:19.676 --> 04:22.179
a brand-new game with me
called fetch-and-fuck.

04:22.179 --> 04:23.513
Fetch!

04:23.513 --> 04:25.015
Basically, Doug drops me off

04:25.015 --> 04:26.808
really far away...

04:26.808 --> 04:28.518
Sayonara, ke-mo sah-bee.

04:28.518 --> 04:31.813
...throws the ball
and drives home without me.

04:31.813 --> 04:34.024
Then it's my turn
to get the ball

04:34.024 --> 04:35.609
and find my way back home.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.486
When I bring the ball back,

04:37.486 --> 04:39.196
- he says...
- Fuck.

04:39.196 --> 04:42.240
And that's
how I know I won the game.

04:42.240 --> 04:43.533
Fetch!

04:44.618 --> 04:46.578
We've been playing it
a lot lately.

04:46.578 --> 04:48.079
Fuck!
- Sometimes we play it

04:48.079 --> 04:49.956
three or four times
in the same day.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.166
Fetch!

04:51.166 --> 04:53.502
-  Fuck.

04:53.502 --> 04:55.295
Fetch! Fuck!

04:55.295 --> 04:57.506
Fuck! Fuck.

05:00.383 --> 05:02.052
Holy fuck!

05:02.052 --> 05:03.470
"Holy fuck" is right.

05:03.470 --> 05:04.721
I win again!

05:04.721 --> 05:06.598
That's it.

05:07.390 --> 05:10.018
This ends now.

05:11.603 --> 05:14.022

a couple miles to go ♪

05:14.022 --> 05:16.066

05:16.066 --> 05:18.527

05:20.987 --> 05:22.614
outside our town.

05:25.617 --> 05:27.786
Keep driving, Doug.

05:27.786 --> 05:29.996
Don't make it too easy on me.

05:29.996 --> 05:32.541
I love a challenge.

the hardest one yet,

05:53.770 --> 05:57.857
because we went way further
than we've ever gone before.

05:57.857 --> 06:01.111
In fact, I have no idea
where we are.

06:01.111 --> 06:02.612
And that's exciting.

06:11.580 --> 06:13.123
Good luck fetching this.

Sure, Doug really
challenges me with this game,

07:03.632 --> 07:06.301
but that's just because
he believes in me.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.055
You know what they say.

07:10.055 --> 07:13.516
The best relationships
are the hard ones.

07:14.392 --> 07:16.519
You have to put in the work.

07:17.354 --> 07:19.397
- You got to have courage.

07:19.397 --> 07:23.193
And you always need to remember
that real love...

07:24.653 --> 07:27.072
...is never easy.

07:49.219 --> 07:51.888
But even though
I love this game,

07:51.888 --> 07:54.724
I kind of want it to be over.

07:54.724 --> 07:57.102
Because, well...

07:57.102 --> 07:59.646
I really just want to be home.

08:12.158 --> 08:15.161
Okay. Time to get moving.

08:15.161 --> 08:17.831
Going back to Doug's.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.837
This is a nice neighborhood.

08:25.463 --> 08:27.382
I like all the trash.

08:27.382 --> 08:28.842
And the needles.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.844
So many needles.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.096
Hey, honey.

08:33.096 --> 08:35.598
You ever been
with an Afghan before?

08:35.598 --> 08:39.602
Uh, no, I-I don't
think so, but thank you.

08:41.604 --> 08:45.066
Well, well, well.
What do we have here?

08:45.066 --> 08:46.359
You lost?

08:46.359 --> 08:48.570
Hi there, uh, big dogs.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.613
Yes, I am lost.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.198
I'm trying to get
to Doug's place.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.033
Do you... do you know which way
that is from here?

08:54.033 --> 08:55.452
Hmm...

08:55.452 --> 08:56.953
- You say Doug's place?
- I did. Yeah.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.955
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I know which way that is.

08:58.955 --> 09:00.123
Oh, great.

09:00.123 --> 09:01.958
Right up my fucking ass,
you little shit.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.626
Oh, no, that can't be right.

09:03.626 --> 09:06.880
O-O-Okay, well,
I'll just be on my way.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.174
Uh, can-can I please have
my ball back?

09:09.174 --> 09:12.135
Your ball? You'll be lucky if
I let you leave with your life.

09:12.135 --> 09:15.013
Hey! Who in the fuck
is making all that noise

09:15.013 --> 09:17.056
- in my fucking alley?
- Whoa, who's this guy?

09:17.056 --> 09:18.767
Oh, you don't want me
to come around

09:18.767 --> 09:20.643
this fucking corner,
now, do you?

09:20.643 --> 09:22.604
Shit's gonna get crackin'.
Trust me.

09:22.604 --> 09:24.481
You want to dance,
motherfuckers, huh?

09:24.481 --> 09:25.940
You want to dance?

09:25.940 --> 09:28.318
Let's do this.

09:28.318 --> 09:30.570
What's up, bitches? Huh?

09:30.570 --> 09:31.821
Oh, he's tiny.

09:31.821 --> 09:33.198
The shadow--
I thought he was...

09:33.198 --> 09:34.574
I thought he was fucking big.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.409
Yeah, we can destroy
this guy, right?

09:36.409 --> 09:39.120
Yeah, go ahead, bite me,
you raggedy motherfuckers.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.455
I dare you.

09:40.455 --> 09:42.332
You know how many diseases
is up in me?

09:42.332 --> 09:45.001
Rabies, scabies,
whatever disease you can get

09:45.001 --> 09:46.795
from tongue-fucking
a dead squirrel.

09:46.795 --> 09:50.173
Which I did last night
'cause I'm crazy, man.

09:51.216 --> 09:53.009
That's a 37-inch vertical.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.969
I'm-a tell you right now,
you run up on me

09:54.969 --> 09:57.722
and I'll stick this paw
right up your ass and in his,

09:57.722 --> 09:59.599
- like a shish kebab.
- Whoa. This guy seems nuts.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.601
Look at the way he's barking
at his own ass.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.019
I'll do it. I'll do it.

10:03.019 --> 10:04.604
I'll bite my own ass off!

10:04.604 --> 10:07.065
Oh, man, the fuck is wrong
with this guy?

10:07.065 --> 10:08.942
I'm so crazy
I'll fuck the trash.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.318
You like it, don't you?

10:10.318 --> 10:11.444
You like it.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.654
You want to get recycled?

10:12.654 --> 10:14.155
Anybody got a twisty tie?

10:14.155 --> 10:16.032
'Cause I'm fucking this bag up.

10:16.032 --> 10:17.283
Okay, who's next?

10:17.283 --> 10:18.785
He's freaking me out.
Let's bounce.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.829
Fight you or I'll fuck you!
Dealer's choice.

10:20.829 --> 10:23.039
But either way,
you're getting worms.

10:24.374 --> 10:26.292
Large breeds, man--
these motherfuckers.

10:26.292 --> 10:30.004
Man, look, always falling for
that crazy little dog trick.

10:30.004 --> 10:31.256
Hey. You with me, kid?

10:31.256 --> 10:32.507
'Cause this block
ain't for dogs like you.

10:32.507 --> 10:33.758
We should get the hell
out of here.

10:33.758 --> 10:35.385
But my tennis ball...

10:35.385 --> 10:37.220
Ah, fuck it.
We'll get you another one.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.936
I'm Bug, by the way.
You got a name?

10:44.936 --> 10:46.145
Oh, uh, right. Sorry.

10:46.145 --> 10:47.397
It's good to meet you, Bug.

10:47.397 --> 10:48.690
M-My name is Shitbag.

10:48.690 --> 10:49.983
What?

10:49.983 --> 10:51.860
Oh, it's short
for Dumbass Shitbag,

10:51.860 --> 10:54.571
but sometimes
Doug pronounces it Fucknugget.

10:54.571 --> 10:57.156
Uh, none of those
sound like names.

10:57.156 --> 11:01.369
Oh. Well, Doug's lady friend
used to call me Reggie.

11:01.369 --> 11:03.830
Reggie. There you go.
Yeah, we're gonna go with that.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.164
Let's keep moving.

11:05.164 --> 11:07.458
So, uh, how long you been
a stray for, Reggie?

11:07.458 --> 11:09.669
- Oh, I... no, I'm not a stray.
- Oh, you're not?

11:09.669 --> 11:11.754
I-I'm just out here
temporarily. -Oh.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.381
I actually have an owner.

11:13.381 --> 11:15.925
We're playing this game where
he drops me off far away...

11:15.925 --> 11:17.135
- Mm-hmm.
- ...throws a ball...

11:17.135 --> 11:18.303
- Right.
- ...and then it's my turn

11:18.303 --> 11:19.762
to bring the ball back home.

11:25.101 --> 11:26.603
Holy shit.

11:26.603 --> 11:28.479
- Yeah.
- That's, uh...

11:28.479 --> 11:29.939
I'm sorry, man,

11:29.939 --> 11:31.608
but that's incredibly tragic.

11:31.608 --> 11:33.276
And the funniest fucking thing

11:33.276 --> 11:35.236
I've heard
in a long fucking time.

11:35.236 --> 11:36.863
Well, I'm glad
you're having a good laugh.

11:36.863 --> 11:39.115
Take it from me, kid,
that owner of yours,

11:39.115 --> 11:41.326
he's not playing
any game with you.

11:41.326 --> 11:43.369
- He left your ass, okay?
- Huh?

11:43.369 --> 11:45.955
You are officially a stray.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.206
D-Don't call me that.

11:47.206 --> 11:48.833
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

11:48.833 --> 11:51.711
I'm a stray, and I'm having
the time of my life.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.630
You'll learn. How old are you?

11:53.630 --> 11:54.839
I'm two.

11:54.839 --> 11:57.342
Well, I'm three,
and I have seen it all.

11:57.342 --> 11:58.635
Paw to God.

11:58.635 --> 12:00.887
I once saw a dog
that was half Labrador

12:00.887 --> 12:02.388
and half poodle.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.265
- A-A labradoodle.
- No, no, no, no.

12:04.265 --> 12:05.975
- A poo-dor.
- A poo-dor?

12:05.975 --> 12:07.185
The other way around.

12:07.185 --> 12:08.811
- Even fucking weirder.
- Yeah.

12:08.811 --> 12:11.314
Point is,
life out here on your own

12:11.314 --> 12:14.651
can be fucking awesome
as long as you go by the rules.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.986
Well, what rules?

12:16.986 --> 12:18.321
Rule number one:

12:18.321 --> 12:20.239
You want something,
you pee on it.

12:20.239 --> 12:22.075
Whatever you pee on,
it's yours.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.368
Let's try it out.

12:23.368 --> 12:24.911
You-you see that lamppost
over there?

12:24.911 --> 12:26.996
Yeah. -Why don't you go
over there and pee on that?

12:26.996 --> 12:28.539
And you're sure this is okay?

12:28.539 --> 12:30.458
Go ahead.
Ain't nobody giving a fuck.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.585
You're a fucking stray now.
That's my point.

12:32.585 --> 12:36.130
Well, I'm-I'm not a stray,
but yeah, okay.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.507
Congratulations.

12:37.507 --> 12:39.759
You now own a lamppost.

12:40.677 --> 12:42.011
Oh, wow.

12:42.011 --> 12:43.846
Now, let's talk
rule number two:

12:43.846 --> 12:46.182
You can pretty much fuck
whatever you want.

12:46.182 --> 12:48.017
Have you ever humped
anything before?

12:48.017 --> 12:50.103
Well, I wouldn't say
I've humped, per se,

12:50.103 --> 12:52.355
but I do like to dance
on Doug's leg.

12:52.355 --> 12:53.898
Dude, that wasn't dancing.

12:53.898 --> 12:56.609
Baby, you was humping--
the devil's dance.

12:56.609 --> 12:59.904
But now the world
is like a buffet

12:59.904 --> 13:02.073
- for your tiny dog dick.
- Really?

13:02.073 --> 13:04.283
You know what?
I recently fucked this couch.

13:04.283 --> 13:05.576
- No.
- Mm-hmm.

13:05.576 --> 13:07.286
Best sex of my life.

13:07.286 --> 13:08.788
- Wow. Really?
- Yeah.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.373
Oh, a-a-and she's dirty, too.

13:10.373 --> 13:11.874
Oh, well, I-I can tell.

13:11.874 --> 13:14.127
Looks like she hasn't
been washed in years.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.045
I'll see you later, baby.

13:19.257 --> 13:21.217
It was nice to meet you.

13:22.010 --> 13:24.554
Now, rule number three,

13:24.554 --> 13:28.182
and this is the most important,
bar none:

13:28.182 --> 13:31.477
You are on your own.

13:31.477 --> 13:32.729
That's awful.

13:32.729 --> 13:34.147
That's not a bad thing,
all right?

13:34.147 --> 13:35.815
Now, right now
you're freaking out

13:35.815 --> 13:37.942
'cause you feel like, you know,
y-you need this Doug guy.

13:37.942 --> 13:40.194
- I do.
- But no, no, trust me.

13:40.194 --> 13:41.654
You don't.

13:41.654 --> 13:44.157
Humans trick us into thinking
that we need 'em,

13:44.157 --> 13:46.242
but they're just
brainwashing us, man.

13:46.242 --> 13:49.287
Point is, you ain't got to deal
with that shit no more, okay?

13:49.287 --> 13:50.830
You a stray.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.915
You can do anything
you want now. -I don't know.

13:52.915 --> 13:55.001
Come on! Repeat after me:

13:55.001 --> 13:57.420
I can do anything.

13:57.420 --> 14:00.173
I can do... anything?

14:00.173 --> 14:01.591
Damn fucking right you can.

14:01.591 --> 14:04.260
Now, you want to see
how fucked-up humans can be?

14:04.260 --> 14:05.720
Come on.

14:06.929 --> 14:10.767
Look at
these motherfuckers here.

14:10.767 --> 14:12.477
A bunch of pet dogs

14:12.477 --> 14:14.645
losing their minds over
their 15 minutes of freedom.

14:14.645 --> 14:19.233
God! If only our wolf ancestors
could see these pussies.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.111
Follow me.

14:22.111 --> 14:24.072
Now, why are these humans
so desperate to keep us?

14:24.072 --> 14:26.532
- Because they love us?
- No, no, I-I got a theory.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.910
- They need us for our poop.
- Huh?

14:28.910 --> 14:30.369
Watch that lady. Watch her.

14:30.369 --> 14:31.913
- See? See?
Uh-huh.

14:31.913 --> 14:34.165
It's like they're
collecting it for something.

14:34.165 --> 14:35.750
What do you think
they're doing with it?

14:35.750 --> 14:37.418
I think they're using it
to make chocolate. -Oh.

14:37.418 --> 14:39.212
Have you ever had
a piece of chocolate? -No.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.547
Exactly. Come on. I'm gonna
introduce you to my homeys.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.925
I thought you said
these dogs were all losers.

14:43.925 --> 14:45.635
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I say a lot of shit.

14:45.635 --> 14:47.553
- Hey, losers.
- Hey, Bug.

14:47.553 --> 14:50.139
Oh, if it isn't the tiny dog
who caught the car.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.474
I did catch that car.

14:51.474 --> 14:52.642
No, everyone knows
that's impossible.

14:52.642 --> 14:53.893
Yeah, it was parked.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.645
Yeah, it parked
after I caught it.

14:55.645 --> 14:57.480
No, there was no one in the
car. -Yeah, no one in the car.

14:57.480 --> 14:59.565
Listen, I don't even have to
keep this conversation going.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.818
What I was trying to do, losers,

15:01.818 --> 15:04.320
was introduce you
to my new friend Reggie.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.613
He just got dumped.

15:05.613 --> 15:07.490
Aw. Sorry, mate.
Welcome to the club.

15:07.490 --> 15:09.283
Uh, sorry.
Was it at least mutual?

15:09.283 --> 15:10.576
Oh, no,
it-it's actually just a game.

15:10.576 --> 15:11.828
Reg, I want you to meet Hunter.

15:11.828 --> 15:13.079
He's a therapy dog

15:13.079 --> 15:15.081
who works in a home
for dying humans.

15:15.081 --> 15:17.500
Which sounds like an okay gig,

15:17.500 --> 15:19.252
except that he was trained
to be a police dog.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.671
You almost made it
to the police squad?

15:21.671 --> 15:23.172
- That's awesome.

15:23.172 --> 15:24.924
Yeah, I-I guess it's awesome.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.843
Get the fuck out of my way,
cone boy!

15:26.843 --> 15:28.511
Oh, uh, sorry about that, Bubsy.

15:28.511 --> 15:30.596
Hunter, say something back, mate.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.431
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah. Um...

15:32.431 --> 15:35.852
Hey, Bubsy, you got
any fucking... weekend plans?

15:35.852 --> 15:37.895
What? It still sounds
friendly. -REGGIE: You got him.

15:37.895 --> 15:39.272
Yeah. Raw-dogging your mom.

15:39.272 --> 15:42.191
Ah, right. Well,
I'm pretty sure she's dead,

15:42.191 --> 15:44.443
- but good luck anyway.
- Pussy!

15:44.443 --> 15:46.779
Love those
observations, Bubs. Take care.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.030
Hunter, get your weight up.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.115
Don't let him talk to you
like that.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.491
You're the biggest dog here.

15:50.491 --> 15:51.826
You should eat
his freaking face off,

15:51.826 --> 15:53.369
shit it out
and then eat it again.

15:53.369 --> 15:54.954
Bug, you know
I don't love confrontation.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.831
Yeah, don't let the big dick
fool you.

15:56.831 --> 15:58.291
He's just a gigantic pussy.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.042
Whoa.

16:00.042 --> 16:01.460
It is a great penis.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.337
Oh, thanks. You know,
I try to keep it clean,

16:03.337 --> 16:05.298
do my best to lick it
as much as possible.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.883
Yeah, the only thing thicker
than Hunter's dick

16:06.883 --> 16:08.718
is the sexual tension
between these two.

16:08.718 --> 16:10.845
- Oh, come on.
- Bug, no. What?

16:10.845 --> 16:12.889
- That's funny, though.
- Yeah, right. Imagine.

16:12.889 --> 16:15.308
"Thicker than Hunter's dick."

16:15.308 --> 16:16.726
- But no, no.
- No.

16:16.726 --> 16:19.645
Now, Maggie, on the other hand,
is one bad bitch.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.731
But sadly,
her owner Jenna thinks

16:21.731 --> 16:24.233
the badder bitch is
the puppy that replaced her.

16:24.233 --> 16:26.611
So, Bella looked at me like,
"I want a cupcake, too,"

16:26.611 --> 16:28.571
so I was like,
"I'm gonna get her a cupcake."

16:28.571 --> 16:30.948
- I am so here for that.
- Right?

16:30.948 --> 16:34.660
So, Jenna said, "Sit,"
which I did.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.078
But then I thought,

16:36.078 --> 16:37.830
"Wouldn't it be cute
if I acted all confused

16:37.830 --> 16:39.957
and tilted my head like,
'Huh?'" -Oh, my God, stop.

16:39.957 --> 16:42.376
Man, sure got to suck
to compete with that.

16:42.376 --> 16:44.045
No, it's fine.

16:44.045 --> 16:46.172
Bella's young and cute and fun,
so of course Jenna loves her

16:46.172 --> 16:47.924
more than me right now,
and I get that.

16:47.924 --> 16:50.468
Cool. Anyways, I was thinking,
if you guys are free later...

16:50.468 --> 16:52.511
But what I really don't get
is why Jenna thinks

16:52.511 --> 16:54.472
it's so adorable when
she spins around in circles.

16:54.472 --> 16:56.057
Like, I could do that
in my sleep.

16:56.057 --> 16:57.600
But you know what?
It's totally fine. It's fine.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.143
Mm, okay. -You know what?
It doesn't get to me

16:59.143 --> 17:00.311
so much anymore.

17:00.311 --> 17:01.646
I'm fine.
I'm not jealous or worried

17:01.646 --> 17:03.064
or angry or depressed
or confused

17:03.064 --> 17:04.649
or fuming or unhinged at all.

17:04.649 --> 17:06.192
Yeah, you seem totally fine.

17:06.192 --> 17:07.777
And now that Jenna's spending
so much time with Bella,

17:07.777 --> 17:09.654
it's given me a chance
to do a little self-care.

17:09.654 --> 17:11.239
Like, I've been going
into the digging.

17:11.239 --> 17:12.823
I really like the feeling
of the soil under my nails.

17:12.823 --> 17:14.367
I'm just, like,
out in the fresh air again.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.785
I'm just really connecting
to the land.

17:15.785 --> 17:17.370
No, I'm-I'm learning
I love digging.

17:17.370 --> 17:20.248
I love digging!
I love it! I love to dig!

17:23.000 --> 17:24.210
- What-what's happening?
- See, Reg?

17:24.210 --> 17:25.795
Aren't you happy
to be a stray now

17:25.795 --> 17:27.880
and not have to deal
with all that owner bullshit?

17:27.880 --> 17:30.174
Well, no, as I said,
I'm not a stray.

17:30.174 --> 17:32.551
Doug and I are just
playing a game. -Mm-hmm.

17:32.551 --> 17:34.470
Look, why don't you come out
with us tonight?

17:34.470 --> 17:36.806
And you can learn
how beautiful it can be

17:36.806 --> 17:38.474
when you're off the leash.

17:38.474 --> 17:41.978
If I can't convince you
that being a stray is great,

17:41.978 --> 17:43.312
- scraps night will.
Sure will.

17:43.312 --> 17:44.772
Yeah.
- Well, thank you,

17:44.772 --> 17:46.816
but I really should be
getting back to Doug.

17:46.816 --> 17:48.150
What? Why?

17:48.150 --> 17:49.485
So I can make him happy.

17:49.485 --> 17:51.028
Isn't that a dog's purpose?

17:51.028 --> 17:53.447
Don't you ever say that again!

17:53.447 --> 17:55.741
-  -Here we go.
- Reggie, your purpose

17:55.741 --> 17:59.578
is not to make some stupid
human families happy.

17:59.578 --> 18:02.873
It's not to make some single
loser feel more complete.

18:02.873 --> 18:05.084
Your purpose is to do...

18:05.084 --> 18:07.962
BUG, HUNTER and MAGGIE:
Whatever the fuck you want.

18:07.962 --> 18:09.547
And when you are a stray...

18:09.547 --> 18:11.424
BUG, HUNTER and MAGGIE:
There's a lot to fucking do.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.134
Why do I feel like
there's an echo in here?

18:13.134 --> 18:14.677
'Cause you've said this
a million times. -I know.

18:14.677 --> 18:16.429
- I love that spiel.
No, it's fine.

18:16.429 --> 18:17.680
It's fine. -You write your own
fucking speeches, okay?

18:17.680 --> 18:18.681
- Okay.
Yeah.

18:18.681 --> 18:20.558
Now, what do you say, guys?

18:20.558 --> 18:22.643
- Another scraps night?
Yes.

18:22.643 --> 18:25.187
All right, meet at
the pizza place at sundown,

18:25.187 --> 18:28.065
and we gonna fuck shit up.

18:34.488 --> 18:36.198

night of the week

18:38.451 --> 18:39.994
where humans are
a lot more willing

18:39.994 --> 18:42.621
to give us food or drop it
accidentally or both.

18:42.621 --> 18:44.874
That stuff that
they're dropping is gold.

18:44.874 --> 18:47.501
Oh. I just feel like we're
gonna get in trouble, though.

18:47.501 --> 18:48.794
No, we're cleaning up.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.421
These fuckers love it
when we clean up.

18:50.421 --> 18:51.922
Wait for it.

18:53.424 --> 18:54.717
Wait for it.

18:54.717 --> 18:55.801
Drop the fucking pizza, bitch.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.053
That's the one!

Oh, I don't mind feeling dizzy.

19:33.464 --> 19:34.715
I can't.

19:34.715 --> 19:37.134
I'm telling you,
there is a magical fence there.

you're his daddy.

Hey, gnome, I'm your father.

Even under
these strange circumstances.

20:53.794 --> 20:55.129
- No, Reggie.
- Reggie!

20:55.129 --> 20:56.213
Oh, you can't get me.

20:56.213 --> 20:57.882
Aha, ah-- I'm too fast for you.

20:57.882 --> 20:59.884
I'm too fast for you.
This motherfucker is keeping up.

- There you go, Reg.

21:05.347 --> 21:06.849
Don't you look at me
like that. -Get up in his ass.

21:06.849 --> 21:08.851
I would hate for this
to get violent.

21:08.851 --> 21:10.352
I didn't know I had a son.

21:10.352 --> 21:11.979
And he's a gnome of all
things. -MAGGIE: Oh, Reggie!

21:11.979 --> 21:14.023
God, shut up! -Does anyone
want to hump my son?

21:14.023 --> 21:16.400
He's handsomely dressed
in a smart little tunic.

Yo, Chester.
You got balls, baby.

21:20.779 --> 21:22.323
I kept telling you!

21:22.323 --> 21:24.992
What a weird thing a magic
fence would be to make up.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.410
I can do anything.

21:26.410 --> 21:27.786
Reggie, don't.
Wait, wait.

21:27.786 --> 21:29.079
- What's going on?
- Reggie, no.

21:29.079 --> 21:30.623
- Don't do it.
Reggie, no.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.708
I can do anything.

21:58.567 --> 22:02.613
Reg, I could tell
the moment I sniffed your anus

22:02.613 --> 22:04.156
you're a great guy.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.991
- You're a legend.
Yeah, baby.

22:05.991 --> 22:08.744
I told you strays life
is the best life.

22:08.744 --> 22:10.037
Yeah, you got to admit,

22:10.037 --> 22:11.914
it's fun to be off leash
for a bit, right?

22:11.914 --> 22:13.874
Right? -Yeah, well,
it is kind of awesome

22:13.874 --> 22:15.501
not having to hold my pee
for ten hours

22:15.501 --> 22:18.003
- until Doug lets me outside.

22:18.003 --> 22:19.797
And I like the sound
of "legend"

22:19.797 --> 22:21.257
a lot more than "shitbag."

22:21.257 --> 22:22.758
Guys, I'm still peeing.

22:22.758 --> 22:24.927
Wait, is that really
what he called you?

22:24.927 --> 22:27.471
And I really don't miss
roasting in the car

22:27.471 --> 22:29.306
when he stops at a store
and he leaves me

22:29.306 --> 22:31.100
with the windows cracked
just barely enough

22:31.100 --> 22:32.977
- for me to stay conscious.
Wait, what?

22:32.977 --> 22:35.062
And I'm just panting,
gasping for air

22:35.062 --> 22:39.108
and trying to survive until
he comes back in 45 minutes.

22:39.108 --> 22:41.735
Classic Doug. Too funny.

22:43.612 --> 22:47.700
So, this guy neglects you,
throws you on the street,

22:47.700 --> 22:49.910
and you still think
he's a good guy?

22:49.910 --> 22:52.246
Yeah. I mean,
if Doug doesn't like me,

22:52.246 --> 22:54.748
why does he let me eat
his leftover human food?

22:54.748 --> 22:57.001
So he doesn't have to buy
dog food.

22:57.001 --> 22:59.128
And why didn't he put
a collar and tags on you?

22:59.128 --> 23:02.047
Because he doesn't believe
in labels.

23:02.047 --> 23:03.132
Oh, come on, Reg.

23:03.132 --> 23:04.425
And the bandanna he gave me

23:04.425 --> 23:06.302
is way more special
than a collar

23:06.302 --> 23:08.971
'cause he used it
for his penis sneezes.

23:08.971 --> 23:10.055
- Ew.
- Ew.

23:10.055 --> 23:11.390
Doug loves me.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.183
We have a good relationship.

23:13.183 --> 23:15.311
You just don't understand
the situation,

23:15.311 --> 23:17.730
because if Doug's
such a bad guy

23:17.730 --> 23:20.816
and he-he left me on purpose

23:20.816 --> 23:24.903
and he hurt me on purpose,
that would mean...

23:24.903 --> 23:27.239
that would mean...

23:27.239 --> 23:29.658
Doug doesn't love me.

23:33.454 --> 23:36.373
Can, uh, you guys
just give me a second?

23:43.464 --> 23:44.882
Oh, poor little guy.

23:44.882 --> 23:47.343
That is just
the classic toxic relationship.

23:47.343 --> 23:50.179
I should probably talk to him.
I am a therapy dog.

23:50.179 --> 23:51.764
Nah, give him some space.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.349
Kid's been through a lot.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.185
That's what
you fucking sound like,

23:56.185 --> 23:57.686
you piece of shit.

24:00.064 --> 24:01.899
Oh, get off! Get--

24:01.899 --> 24:04.318

24:15.663 --> 24:17.289
Hey, Reggie.

24:17.289 --> 24:18.791
I know you're feeling hurt
right now

24:18.791 --> 24:20.876
and it's-- ugh--
must be so hard

24:20.876 --> 24:22.378
to figure out what to do...

24:22.378 --> 24:23.629
I'm going back to Doug's.

24:23.629 --> 24:25.047
- What?
- The fuck, man?

24:25.047 --> 24:26.715
What's it gonna take
for you to understand

24:26.715 --> 24:28.926
that he's not playing
a game with you?

24:28.926 --> 24:31.553
And I'm not playing a game
with him.

24:31.553 --> 24:33.097
Okay...

24:33.097 --> 24:36.266
All my life, I felt like
I wasn't worth anything

24:36.266 --> 24:39.895
unless I heard those words,
"Good boy,"

24:39.895 --> 24:41.855
but they never came.

24:41.855 --> 24:45.109
Well, he needs to know
he's hurt me.

24:45.109 --> 24:46.485
He needs to feel my pain.

24:46.485 --> 24:49.071
And he needs to pay
for what he did

24:49.071 --> 24:50.989
with the only thing
he truly loves.

24:51.740 --> 24:54.076
I'm gonna bite his dick off.

24:54.076 --> 24:55.911
- Oh.
- Wait, did he just say bite...

24:55.911 --> 24:57.496
Yeah, I-I'm still
a little drunk,

24:57.496 --> 24:59.665
but did I just hear you say
that you were gonna...

24:59.665 --> 25:02.626
I said I'm gonna bite
his dick off.

25:02.626 --> 25:05.671
- Oh, I'm 100% in for this.
No, no, no, no, no.

25:05.671 --> 25:07.715
Bug. Wait, wait, wait.
Reggie, please.

25:07.715 --> 25:10.092
I feel you-- I really do--
but this-this is insane.

25:10.092 --> 25:11.969
Yeah, like, maybe there's

25:11.969 --> 25:13.595
a metaphorical dick
you could bite off.

25:13.595 --> 25:15.264
Like-like-like you could
pretend my dick is his dick,

25:15.264 --> 25:17.015
and you could give it
a stern talking-to.

25:17.015 --> 25:19.560
No, his dick-- no exceptions.

25:19.560 --> 25:21.603
Playing with that thing
was his favorite activity

25:21.603 --> 25:23.397
until he started
putting things in boxes.

25:23.397 --> 25:25.566
Boxes? -Oh, shit.
That means he's moving soon.

25:25.566 --> 25:26.942
- Moving? Oh, God.
Oh, man.

25:26.942 --> 25:28.360
- Wh-What if we're too late?
- Calm down.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.903
We definitely
don't have much time.

25:29.903 --> 25:31.864
Any places, smells,
landmarks you remember

25:31.864 --> 25:33.157
on the road to get here?

25:33.157 --> 25:35.451
Uh, I-I just...
I-I remember passing

25:35.451 --> 25:37.327
an enormous hamster wheel.

25:37.327 --> 25:39.329
- Okay, hamster wheel.
- Uh, uh, a giant cone

25:39.329 --> 25:40.873
that looked like Hunter's.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.374
Giant cone that looked
like Hunter's. Okay.

25:42.374 --> 25:44.334
And the...
and the devil in the sky.

25:44.334 --> 25:47.212
And the devil in the sky. Boom!
That's basically a road map

25:47.212 --> 25:49.465
right to this guy's
custard launcher.

25:49.465 --> 25:51.133
Bug, there's no way.
It's impossible.

25:51.133 --> 25:52.634
Nah. No, no, no, not quite.

25:52.634 --> 25:53.927
Reggie's got no shot

25:53.927 --> 25:55.596
of making it back in time
on his own,

25:55.596 --> 25:58.807
but if we all go,
I got the street smarts,

25:58.807 --> 26:00.601
you got the muscle,
and Maggie's got

26:00.601 --> 26:03.312
a sense of smell so good
she could sniff one asshole

26:03.312 --> 26:05.898
and tell you what the guy ate
three breakfasts ago.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.816
-  Bunch of nickels.
- Exactly.

26:07.816 --> 26:08.817
She's incredible.

26:08.817 --> 26:10.819
Guys, we can do this.

26:10.819 --> 26:12.780
- No, there is no way...

27:49.334 --> 27:50.669
Okay.

27:50.669 --> 27:52.254
I bet that's some of the pizza
from last night.

27:52.254 --> 27:54.089
Oh, yeah,
lot-lots of good shit in there.

27:54.089 --> 27:55.465
Oh, there's those nickels.

27:55.465 --> 27:57.092
Guys, we-we got to keep moving.

27:57.092 --> 27:58.302
You can't miss this thing.

27:58.302 --> 27:59.970
It's like a giant hamster wheel

27:59.970 --> 28:02.598
but without the hamster
and it smells like hot dogs.

28:02.598 --> 28:04.433
Smells like hot dogs?

28:04.433 --> 28:06.894
This is her superpower.
She's unbelievable.

28:06.894 --> 28:08.687
- Look at that nose.
You got something?

28:08.687 --> 28:10.147
Wait a minute.

28:10.147 --> 28:11.732
Wait, d-do you smell that?

28:11.732 --> 28:13.108
I just smell plastic.

28:13.108 --> 28:14.526
Oh, yeah. Oh.

28:14.526 --> 28:15.986
Yeah, I've got it.

28:15.986 --> 28:18.655
She's walking away.
Should we follow her?

28:18.655 --> 28:20.532
I'm gonna follow her.

28:21.491 --> 28:23.118
No, no, no, no, no.
A sausage is the one

28:23.118 --> 28:24.870
that looks like shit
but it don't taste like shit.

28:24.870 --> 28:26.580
Okay. What is a hot dog?

28:26.580 --> 28:27.956
Guys. Shh. Drop it. Look.

28:27.956 --> 28:29.416
- What the fuck is this?
- That's it.

28:29.416 --> 28:30.918
The giant hamster wheel.

28:30.918 --> 28:32.544
- We're on the right track.
All right, guys.

28:32.544 --> 28:34.880
We're on a time crunch,
but Hunter's gonna die

28:34.880 --> 28:36.632
if we don't get some food
in him, okay?

28:36.632 --> 28:37.925
Maggie, you hang with Hunter.

28:37.925 --> 28:39.301
Gotcha.
Good plan.

28:39.301 --> 28:41.094
- Reg, you know what time it is?
- Uh...

28:41.094 --> 28:42.679
- It's grub time. Damn right.
- It's grub... yeah, grub time.

28:42.679 --> 28:44.932
- Let's get some grub.
- Let's get some grub.

28:44.932 --> 28:46.600
This fucking place is weird.

28:46.600 --> 28:48.101
So weird.

28:48.101 --> 28:49.561
I never really can
understand humans, man,

28:49.561 --> 28:51.188
especially, like,
the lighter-shade ones.

28:51.188 --> 28:52.856
They some strange motherfuckers.

28:52.856 --> 28:54.900
I was thinking the same thing.

28:54.900 --> 28:57.402
- Hey.

28:59.112 --> 29:01.907
Um...
your dog messed up my shot.

29:01.907 --> 29:04.076
- Uh, I think he's telling me

29:04.076 --> 29:05.911
I should pay for you
to take another one.

29:05.911 --> 29:07.621
Oh, is that right?

29:07.621 --> 29:09.081
Yeah, that's what...
that's what he was saying.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.999
- I promise.

29:10.999 --> 29:12.417
I wouldn't...
I wouldn't make it up,

29:12.417 --> 29:14.127
but he's a good...
he's got good ideas.

29:14.127 --> 29:16.254
I could tell
James felt different

29:16.254 --> 29:17.923
about this human girl.

29:17.923 --> 29:20.592
Maybe it was because
she smelled like biscuits.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.177
Or maybe it was because

29:22.177 --> 29:23.887
something about her was special.

29:23.887 --> 29:27.099
Excuse me. Do you know where we
can get some food around here?

29:27.849 --> 29:29.851
As I was saying,

29:29.851 --> 29:32.437
James thought
he was helping this girl,

29:32.437 --> 29:35.691
but the truth is
she was helping him.

29:35.691 --> 29:36.942
Oh, fuck this bullshit.

29:36.942 --> 29:38.193
Wait, what is he doing?

29:38.193 --> 29:39.444
I've seen this shit before.

29:39.444 --> 29:41.279
He's one of those
narrator dogs.

29:41.279 --> 29:44.282
Hey! No one's listening
to your lame human story,

29:44.282 --> 29:45.742
you fucking dumbass.

29:48.286 --> 29:51.289
Sadly, the little dog was right.

29:51.289 --> 29:54.001
No one was listening
to my story.

29:54.001 --> 29:56.586
Which is too bad
because I'm the only one

29:56.586 --> 29:59.756
who knows James is
a cold-blooded serial killer.

29:59.756 --> 30:03.427
He's got three bodies buried
in the backyard already,

30:03.427 --> 30:05.929
but I guess no one's interested.

30:05.929 --> 30:07.180
I can't believe that dog.

30:07.180 --> 30:08.640
He was so obsessed
with his owner

30:08.640 --> 30:09.891
he didn't even acknowledge us.

30:09.891 --> 30:11.393
I'm-a tell you, kid,

30:11.393 --> 30:12.853
the moment they leash you up,
snip your balls

30:12.853 --> 30:14.646
is the moment
they got you by 'em.

30:14.646 --> 30:17.190
Hold on. They snip your balls?

30:17.190 --> 30:18.567
- Oh, yeah.
- Ugh.

30:18.567 --> 30:19.943
And I think they're
collecting those, too,

30:19.943 --> 30:21.403
- to put in the chocolate.
Come on!

30:21.403 --> 30:23.071
- Get your hot dogs here!
- Oh, shit. Look.

30:23.071 --> 30:25.073
- I got jumbo dogs!
- Okay, here's the plan.

30:25.073 --> 30:26.867
You grab the sausages,
and I'll go over there

30:26.867 --> 30:28.744
and fuck the guy's leg
as a distraction.

30:28.744 --> 30:30.328
And... break!

30:30.328 --> 30:33.707
Uh, I don't think fucking
the guy's leg is necessary,

30:33.707 --> 30:36.084
but I see you've
already started. All right.

30:36.084 --> 30:37.627
- Ooh, gimme, gimme, gimme.

30:37.627 --> 30:39.880
- Bunny!
You won!

30:39.880 --> 30:41.339
- I can't believe I won!
- Yeah!

30:41.339 --> 30:43.550
Oh, look at that toy bunny.

30:43.550 --> 30:45.469
You know, it hasn't even
been a day yet,

30:45.469 --> 30:47.137
but I really miss toys.

30:47.137 --> 30:48.764
Jenna had some good ones.

30:48.764 --> 30:50.390
I'd rip that shit apart

30:50.390 --> 30:52.601
until I found that squeaky toy
in the middle.

30:52.601 --> 30:54.269
Ugh, I miss squeaky toys, too.

30:54.269 --> 30:56.104
But, of course,
I only got to play

30:56.104 --> 30:58.065
with those squeak toys
if I was a good girl

30:58.065 --> 31:00.901
and I smiled the right way for
her stupid freaking selfies.

31:00.901 --> 31:03.904
The amount of work
that goes into looking cute.

31:03.904 --> 31:05.197
Honestly,
I had to go spin around

31:05.197 --> 31:06.656
in a perfect circle like this,

31:06.656 --> 31:08.241
move into a
"oh, I'm so fuckable" pose

31:08.241 --> 31:09.743
with my paws crossed,

31:09.743 --> 31:11.870
and then I'd have to
stand up straight, paws up.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.413
I have to show all my tits.

31:13.413 --> 31:16.291
Yeah, right, that--
yeah, that's pretty fuckable.

31:16.291 --> 31:19.127
I mean, uh, that-that...
that's-that's weird.

31:19.127 --> 31:20.545
Wait, uh, there they are.

31:20.545 --> 31:23.632
You know,
Maggie, there's, um...

31:23.632 --> 31:27.135
there's so much more to like
about you than just your looks.

31:27.135 --> 31:28.470
- You think so?
- Sure.

31:28.470 --> 31:30.722
I-I mean, you are hands down

31:30.722 --> 31:32.516
the best sniffer I've ever met.

31:32.516 --> 31:33.934
- Huh.
- But you're also smart

31:33.934 --> 31:35.185
and you can jump high

31:35.185 --> 31:37.646
and you know
like nine human words.

31:37.646 --> 31:38.939
That's insane.

31:38.939 --> 31:40.982
I actually know 31,
but thank you.

31:40.982 --> 31:43.485
Honestly, I-I'd have to list
about 20 more things

31:43.485 --> 31:45.570
before I even got
to anything to do with

31:45.570 --> 31:47.197
how beautiful you are.

31:49.241 --> 31:50.867
Um...

31:50.867 --> 31:52.452
I'm sorry, that was too much.

31:52.452 --> 31:55.580
No, that-that means
a lot to me.

31:55.580 --> 31:58.375
You know,
you're a really good listener.

31:58.375 --> 31:59.793
Oh, that's because
all the sound

31:59.793 --> 32:01.461
funnels through the cone
right to my ears.

32:01.461 --> 32:03.130
No, I didn't...

32:03.130 --> 32:05.173
- Never mind.
- Wait, wait. What?

32:05.173 --> 32:08.343
Have you ever thought about...
about taking the cone off

32:08.343 --> 32:11.429
for a little while
just to... just to see?

32:11.429 --> 32:12.889
No.

32:12.889 --> 32:15.267
I bet you'd look
really handsome.

32:15.267 --> 32:16.685
Really?

32:16.685 --> 32:18.270
Yeah.

32:18.270 --> 32:19.896
BUG
That's how you do it, Reg, baby.

32:19.896 --> 32:21.356
That was awesome!

32:21.356 --> 32:23.984
Oh, wait a minute.
Okay, what's this vibe?

32:23.984 --> 32:25.235
-  Oh, no.
- Oh, nothing.

32:25.235 --> 32:26.528
- Yeah, what vibe?
- Nothing.

32:26.528 --> 32:27.946
- What vibe?
- There is no vibe.

32:27.946 --> 32:30.115
Your boner implies
that there's a vibe.

32:30.115 --> 32:33.118
Oh, uh, well, you know, that's
because our friendship...

32:33.118 --> 32:34.828
got me erect.

32:34.828 --> 32:36.454
Yeah, it was a friend boner.

32:36.454 --> 32:38.373
Then why don't you get boners
for us?

32:38.373 --> 32:40.792
I mean, uh,
are we not your friends?

32:40.792 --> 32:43.461
What? No, no, you guys
get me hard all the time.

32:43.461 --> 32:47.007
Hunter, that's about the
sweetest thing I've ever heard.

32:47.007 --> 32:49.759
Speaking of boners,
how about some sausages?

32:49.759 --> 32:51.261
We took 'em from a human.

32:51.261 --> 32:53.722
You stole these from a human?
What if someone saw?

32:53.722 --> 32:55.724
Relax.
Grow back some testicles.

32:55.724 --> 32:57.851
- Ain't nobody saw.

33:00.103 --> 33:01.479
God saw!

33:01.479 --> 33:03.273
God sees everything!

33:03.273 --> 33:05.066
- Run!

33:05.066 --> 33:07.194
- We're under attack!
- Save yourselves!

33:07.194 --> 33:08.653
We got to find cover!

33:08.653 --> 33:10.655
The whole fucking place
is gonna blow!

33:10.655 --> 33:12.365
Move! Move!

33:12.365 --> 33:13.867
Oh, God!

33:13.867 --> 33:15.952
We're all gonna die!

33:15.952 --> 33:17.495
Mama!

33:17.495 --> 33:19.206
- Wow.

33:20.916 --> 33:22.542
- Duck! -Stay low!

33:22.542 --> 33:25.337
- They got us surrounded!
- Go, go, go!

33:25.337 --> 33:26.546
- Run!
- They're coming after us!

33:26.546 --> 33:27.839
This way! Hurry!

33:27.839 --> 33:29.799
It's so loud inside the cone!

33:32.135 --> 33:33.470
- Oh, shit.
- No.

33:33.470 --> 33:35.096
- No, no, no, no, no, no!
- We got to get over.

33:35.096 --> 33:37.682
We got to dig. We got to dig!

33:37.682 --> 33:38.892
Dig. Dig faster.

33:38.892 --> 33:40.352
Hunter, Maggie, help us dig.

33:40.352 --> 33:42.604
- What? What's going on?
- Come on, Maggie, dig!

33:42.604 --> 33:44.606
- You said you love digging.
- I lied!

33:44.606 --> 33:47.484
- I hate digging!
- There we go.

33:47.484 --> 33:48.944
Okay, let's go.

33:48.944 --> 33:50.946
Oh, I hate how the dirt feels
under my nails!

33:50.946 --> 33:52.447
Wait, wait. Guys, I'm stuck!

33:52.447 --> 33:54.950
My bandanna's stuck!

33:54.950 --> 33:56.701
Aah!

33:56.701 --> 33:58.245
- Oh, no.
- Reggie!

33:58.245 --> 34:00.372
- Reggie, no!
- Reggie, come on, buddy.

34:00.372 --> 34:01.539
Maggie, Hunter, help me out.

34:01.539 --> 34:03.041
No, no, no, no.
Get out of here.

34:03.041 --> 34:04.251
It-It's too late for me.

34:04.251 --> 34:06.044
Listen to me.
It's not too late.

34:06.044 --> 34:07.712
No. Save yourself.

34:07.712 --> 34:11.007
And tell Doug I wanted
to bite his dick off.

34:11.007 --> 34:13.260
Bite it for me, if you can.

34:13.260 --> 34:15.470
Look at me. You're gonna live,

34:15.470 --> 34:19.140
and you're gonna bite
that dick yourself.

34:19.140 --> 34:20.767
Hunter, the fence!

34:22.936 --> 34:24.271
Check this out.

34:24.271 --> 34:26.439
Come on.

34:26.439 --> 34:28.858
Holy shit, they have a bomb!

34:29.776 --> 34:32.946
- Come on, Reggie.
- Come on.

34:35.907 --> 34:37.575
I'm almost free.
I'm almost free.

34:37.575 --> 34:38.743
- Come on, Reggie!
- Aah!

34:38.743 --> 34:40.287
Aah! Come on, let's go!

34:40.996 --> 34:42.664
Let's move, move, move, move!

34:42.664 --> 34:44.958
Come on, guys, let's go!

34:48.295 --> 34:50.797
Oh, well, uh...

34:50.797 --> 34:52.382
You guys want to kiss a little?

34:52.382 --> 34:55.719
- Oh, my God! Holy shit.

34:55.719 --> 34:57.345
Guys, that was crazy.

34:57.345 --> 34:59.347
I feel like now I need
an emotional support dog.

34:59.347 --> 35:02.559
Bug, (laughs) you looked like
you were gonna shit yourself.

35:02.559 --> 35:04.561
I did. I literally did that.

35:04.561 --> 35:06.187
Oh, God. -HUNTER: He did.
I stepped in it.

35:06.187 --> 35:08.315
- Reg, you okay?

35:08.315 --> 35:10.025
Uh, it's nothing. I-I...

35:10.025 --> 35:13.445
It's just, you guys
risked your life for me.

35:13.445 --> 35:15.113
Bug, you saved me.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.948
I never thought
anyone would do that.

35:16.948 --> 35:19.034
Of course we would. Come on.

35:19.034 --> 35:20.785
You're part of the pack, Reggie.

35:20.785 --> 35:22.620
- We stick together.
That's right.

35:22.620 --> 35:24.497
I've never been part
of a pack before.

35:24.497 --> 35:25.707
Well, you are now.

35:25.707 --> 35:27.459
I didn't even know
that was a thing.

35:27.459 --> 35:29.252
- We'll make it a thing.

35:29.252 --> 35:30.462
Yeah.

35:30.462 --> 35:33.298
So, I kind of have
a weird idea.

35:33.298 --> 35:35.884
Could... could we maybe...

35:35.884 --> 35:38.178
pee on each other?

35:38.178 --> 35:39.054
Say what, now?

35:39.054 --> 35:40.555
Well, you said that

35:40.555 --> 35:42.474
when you pee on something
that it's yours.

35:42.474 --> 35:44.059
I just thought that,
since we're all,

35:44.059 --> 35:45.560
like, friends now, we could...

35:45.560 --> 35:48.897
Pee on each other
so we belong to each other?

35:48.897 --> 35:50.023
Yeah.

35:50.023 --> 35:51.900
That was a stupid idea.

35:51.900 --> 35:55.570
Jenna would be so mad if
I came home covered in urine.

35:56.446 --> 35:58.281
- Let's fucking do it.
Oh, we're doing it.

35:58.281 --> 36:00.950
Okay. Why don't we, like,
do, like, a circle thing?

36:00.950 --> 36:02.827
Yeah, and let's just lift
our left leg. -Starboard side.

36:02.827 --> 36:05.372
Yeah, lift our left leg,
and then we'll... -There we go.

36:05.372 --> 36:07.749
- Oh, good, I get to pee on Bug.
- Yeah, that's good.

36:09.334 --> 36:10.543
Whoa.

36:10.543 --> 36:12.003
You know, this isn't just
warming my body.

36:12.003 --> 36:13.296
It's warming my heart.

36:13.296 --> 36:14.589
Aw.
Wow.

36:14.589 --> 36:16.466
I guess this makes us
family now.

36:16.466 --> 36:18.593
- Yeah, we're BFFs.
Yeah.

36:18.593 --> 36:21.262
Even better. We're Pee-FFs.

36:21.262 --> 36:23.264
Pee-FFs! I love it.

36:23.264 --> 36:25.809
- Yeah. Love that.
Oh, Bug!

36:25.809 --> 36:27.727
You look happy.

36:27.727 --> 36:29.270
What are you talking about,
I look happy?

36:29.270 --> 36:30.688
I'm just smiling
because we're all sitting here

36:30.688 --> 36:32.232
pissing on each other,
so I just...

36:32.232 --> 36:34.109
I cracked a smile.
It's not an emotional thing.

36:34.109 --> 36:35.819
- Nah, you love us.
You love us!

36:35.819 --> 36:37.529
Okay, that's it. -HUNTER:
Yeah, that's right. You do.

36:37.529 --> 36:39.197
- That's my cue to go to bed.
- Oh, come on, Bug.

36:39.197 --> 36:41.408
Look, listen, listen,
we got a lot of walking to do

36:41.408 --> 36:42.909
and not much time to do it.

36:42.909 --> 36:45.036
Let's get some sleep.

36:45.036 --> 36:47.122
H-H-Ho-Hold on one second.

36:50.458 --> 36:52.335
- Go back the other way.
- Better the other way.

36:52.335 --> 36:54.212
Try sniffing the ground. H-Have
you tried sniffing the ground?

36:54.212 --> 36:56.339
- Fucked that one up.
- You got to reset yourself.

36:56.339 --> 36:57.841
- Yeah, you go back 90 degrees.
- Fucked that one up, too.

36:57.841 --> 36:59.426
- You were so close.
Now sit down.

36:59.426 --> 37:01.761
- That'll do. That'll do.
- All right, finally, good.

37:01.761 --> 37:04.639
- Time for bed. Yeah. Okay.
Let's get some sleep.

37:04.639 --> 37:06.182
And a quick turn.

37:06.182 --> 37:08.017
- Time to go to sl...
- Wait. Hang on. -One turn.

37:08.017 --> 37:09.644
- Two turns. Three turns.
Oh, God.

37:09.644 --> 37:11.020
Bug's really fucked
with my head. I don't know...

37:11.020 --> 37:12.772
- There.
Five,

37:12.772 --> 37:14.607
- four, three, two, one.
Again. Again. Okay.

37:14.607 --> 37:15.733
Okay, okay, now I'm ready.

37:15.733 --> 37:18.194
Easy.

37:18.194 --> 37:20.280
And... down.

37:20.280 --> 37:22.490
I'm getting much faster
at that.

37:23.741 --> 37:25.243
- Good night, everyone.
- Good night, Reg.

37:25.243 --> 37:26.453
- Good night, Reggie.
- And, uh, thanks again

37:26.453 --> 37:27.954
for letting me pee on you guys.

37:27.954 --> 37:29.289
- Reggie?
- Yeah?

37:29.289 --> 37:30.623
Could you just stop
fucking talking, please?

37:30.623 --> 37:32.584
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

37:40.925 --> 37:43.178
Okay, guys. Big day today.

37:43.178 --> 37:44.929
Next up is the giant cone.

37:44.929 --> 37:47.307
I don't know what kind of
cone we're gonna find out here.

37:47.307 --> 37:49.767
It can't be too hard
to find. It's gigantic.

37:49.767 --> 37:51.644
All I see is trees,
but whatever.

37:51.644 --> 37:54.731
Hey, mate, have you thought
about how you're gonna do it?

37:54.731 --> 37:56.191
Uh, sorry. D-Do what?

37:56.191 --> 37:57.859
- Bite Doug's dick off.
- Oh.

37:57.859 --> 38:00.945
Were you thinking lengthwise
or tip-to-shaft?

38:00.945 --> 38:03.615
Gosh, I don't know. I-I've
never bitten off a dick before.

38:03.615 --> 38:06.284
I guess I'll let it
just come to me in the moment.

38:06.284 --> 38:08.786
So, at what point of this trip
are you gonna build up

38:08.786 --> 38:10.455
a little BDE
and make a move, huh?

38:10.455 --> 38:12.290
With Maggie? -Yes, Mag...
No, with this mossy stump.

38:12.290 --> 38:14.250
What the fuck you think
I'm talking about?

38:14.250 --> 38:16.753
No way.
She wouldn't go for me.

38:16.753 --> 38:19.005
I mean, maybe a door opens up
down the road,

38:19.005 --> 38:20.507
but for now we're just friends.

38:20.507 --> 38:22.258
Wh-What are you talking about,
opening up doors?

38:22.258 --> 38:23.551
We don't have thumbs.

38:23.551 --> 38:25.512
You got to knock
the fucking door down.

38:25.512 --> 38:27.222
Yeah, but who would
want to date

38:27.222 --> 38:30.058
a failed police dog
who wears a cone 24/7?

38:30.058 --> 38:33.520
Oh, come on, dude.
Girls date losers all the time.

38:33.520 --> 38:37.440
You know, Reggie, that you
don't have to do it, right?

38:37.440 --> 38:39.734
What are you talking about?
Of course I do.

38:39.734 --> 38:41.486
I'm gonna get
all over that dick.

38:41.486 --> 38:42.987
Chomp, chomp, chomp. Mmm!

38:42.987 --> 38:45.323
Yeah, but you could just,
you know, move on from Doug,

38:45.323 --> 38:47.742
and then you wouldn't have to
do anything to him at all.

38:47.742 --> 38:49.744
You could always
just let it go.

38:49.744 --> 38:51.496
I-I'm not...

38:51.496 --> 38:53.873
No, I'm not just
gonna let it go.

38:53.873 --> 38:55.208
All right, look,

38:55.208 --> 38:56.834
you failed doggie school
'cause you was a wuss,

38:56.834 --> 38:58.878
but there's nothing
we can do about your past.

38:58.878 --> 39:02.382
We might, however, be able to
get that thing off your head.

39:02.382 --> 39:04.551
- This? No, no, you can't.
- Sure, we can.

39:04.551 --> 39:06.594
If we all pull together,
we could...

39:06.594 --> 39:08.680
No, no, I mean, I-I need it.

39:08.680 --> 39:10.848
I keep it on intentionally.

39:10.848 --> 39:12.433
Wait, really? I just assumed

39:12.433 --> 39:14.185
it was, like, you know,
a medical thing.

39:14.185 --> 39:15.395
Oh, it is.

39:15.395 --> 39:17.021
I-I'll do anything
to keep it on.

39:17.021 --> 39:19.357
And most self-inflicted
injuries will do the trick.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.776
You know, cat scratches,
ear infection from the toilet,

39:21.776 --> 39:23.903
lick my testicles
for hours and hours

39:23.903 --> 39:26.364
until the humans get concerned.

39:26.364 --> 39:29.033
But it's worth it.
I get anxious sometimes,

39:29.033 --> 39:31.703
and the cone helps me
block things out.

39:31.703 --> 39:34.038
What are you guys
talking about?

39:34.038 --> 39:36.332
Oh, uh, nothing.
You know, same old, same old.

39:36.332 --> 39:37.875
I'm telling him he's got to get

39:37.875 --> 39:39.627
- that big dick energy.
-  Bug.

39:39.627 --> 39:41.504
Well, you got
the first part down.

39:41.504 --> 39:43.631
Aw, thanks for complimenting
my penis, Maggie.

39:43.631 --> 39:45.508
You know,
your vagina's huge, too.

39:45.508 --> 39:48.678
- Seriously?
- Shit. Why did I say that?

39:50.013 --> 39:51.806
Hey, Reg,
let me ask you something.

39:51.806 --> 39:53.308
Yeah?
- How sure are you

39:53.308 --> 39:54.976
that the big cone is this way?

39:54.976 --> 39:58.479
I don't know, on a scale
of sure to not sure,

39:58.479 --> 40:00.273
pretty sure...

40:02.066 --> 40:03.985
...that I'm not really sure.
That I'm sure of.

40:03.985 --> 40:06.070
- Holy shit. We're lost.
Ah, great.

40:06.070 --> 40:08.072
- I knew this would happen.
- Hey, calm down, Bug.

40:08.072 --> 40:10.074
We'll figure it out.
This could be a lot worse.

40:10.074 --> 40:11.826
Oh, really, Hunter?
I'm starving,

40:11.826 --> 40:14.329
we're completely fucking lost,
and my little puppy paw pads

40:14.329 --> 40:15.913
are really hurting right now,

40:15.913 --> 40:18.333
so how exactly
could this get worse?

40:19.167 --> 40:20.835
Huh? How could it?
Tell me, huh?

40:20.835 --> 40:22.587
How could it get worse?

40:23.421 --> 40:24.839
- Oh, oh, oh!

40:24.839 --> 40:26.591
Bug! -Why did I say
it could get a lot worse?

40:26.591 --> 40:28.343
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, please,
please, please don't drop me.

40:28.343 --> 40:30.053
- Don't eat me. None of that!
Bug!

40:30.053 --> 40:31.512
That eagle has
some good timing.

40:31.512 --> 40:33.097
Bug! Hold on, buddy!

40:33.097 --> 40:34.641
Reg, Reggie, guys, help me.

40:34.641 --> 40:36.934
Ask him if he wouldn't mind
bringing you lower!

40:36.934 --> 40:38.353
What?
What are you talking about?

40:38.353 --> 40:40.063
- I don't speak bird.
- We're in a real pickle!

40:40.063 --> 40:41.898
Help, help, help. Do something.
Somebody do something.

40:41.898 --> 40:43.566
Oh! Oh, God!

40:47.236 --> 40:48.112
Fuck!

40:48.112 --> 40:50.615
Yes! No!
Shit, this is fucking crazy.

40:50.615 --> 40:52.158
- We're going higher.
Hold on, buddy.

40:52.158 --> 40:53.785
Reggie! Bug!

40:53.785 --> 40:56.913
Oh, wow, your balls look huge
from this angle.

40:56.913 --> 40:59.874
Thank you, but holy fuck!

41:01.084 --> 41:04.128
That is
a golden-cheeked warbler.

41:04.128 --> 41:06.589
I've been missing that one.

41:07.507 --> 41:09.258
Uh...

41:13.221 --> 41:14.389
Check.

41:22.230 --> 41:24.232
Holy shit.

41:24.232 --> 41:27.902
That is the craziest thing
I have ever seen.

41:28.986 --> 41:30.530
And I'm Dennis Quaid,

41:30.530 --> 41:33.408
and Dennis Quaid
has seen some shit.

41:33.408 --> 41:35.743
- Let me down, bitch!
- Bug, look! Over there!

41:35.743 --> 41:37.495
- The giant cone!
- What?

41:37.495 --> 41:39.956
The giant cone!
Oh, the cone.

41:39.956 --> 41:41.416
Well, shit,
that would be great news

41:41.416 --> 41:43.418
if we weren't stuck
to this fucking bird.

41:44.585 --> 41:46.838
Bug, I got an idea. Hang on!

41:46.838 --> 41:49.590
- Reg, what are you doing?

41:49.590 --> 41:51.926
Oh, God.

41:51.926 --> 41:54.429
That's bold. It's too bold.

41:56.097 --> 41:58.307
Here we go!

42:01.436 --> 42:03.646
- Well, shit. Ow!
- Aah!

42:04.105 --> 42:05.523
Fuck! Not again!

42:07.608 --> 42:08.776
Reggie! Bug!

42:08.776 --> 42:10.903
Aah! Help!
Aah! Branch!

42:10.903 --> 42:13.197
Shit! Fuck!
Oh! Smaller branch!

42:19.078 --> 42:21.205
Wow, they're hitting
a worst-case-scenario

42:21.205 --> 42:23.207
amount of branches.

42:23.207 --> 42:25.334
Paws, paws, paws, paws, paws!

42:25.334 --> 42:26.711
Tail!

42:28.880 --> 42:30.715
Oh, my God, I am so sorry.

42:30.715 --> 42:32.925
I did not mean to barge in
like this.

42:32.925 --> 42:34.177
- What, are you guys wrestling?

42:34.177 --> 42:35.803
Shit!

42:35.803 --> 42:38.431
Bug!

42:38.431 --> 42:40.641
- Reggie!
You're alive!

42:40.641 --> 42:42.560
Fuck, got a stick up my ass.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.312
Well, Hunter was right.

42:44.312 --> 42:46.230
That could've been worse.

42:46.230 --> 42:47.857
Just get the fuck
out of the bush.

42:47.857 --> 42:50.151
Reggie, you are
once again a legend.

42:50.151 --> 42:51.402
Guys, that was epic.

42:51.402 --> 42:53.488
Fucking leaves. Get off me.

42:53.488 --> 42:54.864
Guys, you wouldn't believe it.

42:54.864 --> 42:56.115
- We saw the giant cone.
What?

42:56.115 --> 42:57.158
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
we did, we did.

42:57.158 --> 42:58.743
- Really?
- That's amazing.

42:58.743 --> 42:59.952
Yeah, that means we're heading
in the right direction.

42:59.952 --> 43:01.245
Yeah, a-and not to be cheesy,

43:01.245 --> 43:02.914
but being up in the sky
like that

43:02.914 --> 43:05.291
just moments from my death,

43:05.291 --> 43:07.502
I-I learned something
about life.

43:07.502 --> 43:08.586
- Wh-What's that?
- What?

43:08.586 --> 43:10.505
Birds don't have genitals.

43:10.505 --> 43:12.757
Well, then how do they...

43:12.757 --> 43:13.966
I don't know.

43:13.966 --> 43:16.552
Maybe they have
both parts inside.

43:16.552 --> 43:18.513
So, if you were to say,
"Go fuck yourself,"

43:18.513 --> 43:21.349
they could actually do it.

43:22.391 --> 43:24.185
Um, okay, then.

43:24.185 --> 43:26.854
So, hey, next up is
the devil in the sky.

43:29.524 --> 43:30.817
Howling.

43:30.817 --> 43:32.527
Come on, guys,
we're over halfway there.

43:32.527 --> 43:34.946
Hey, my howl's getting
better. You guys hear that?

43:34.946 --> 43:36.906
- Hey, man, uh...
- Yeah?

43:36.906 --> 43:38.908
I really appreciate
what you did up there.

43:38.908 --> 43:40.910
I mean, no need to pee
on each other

43:40.910 --> 43:43.454
or anything like that,
but thanks.

43:43.454 --> 43:46.040
Of course. We're Pee-FFs.

43:46.040 --> 43:47.542
We stick together.

43:47.542 --> 43:49.126
All right, all right,
all right. Enough.

43:49.126 --> 43:50.670
Put your tongue
back in your mouth.

43:54.882 --> 43:58.302
Okay, okay. Never have
I ever gone down on a girl dog.

43:58.302 --> 43:59.554
Really? Seriously?

43:59.554 --> 44:00.888
You guys lick your balls
all day.

44:00.888 --> 44:02.557
Oh, no, no, no.
That's different.

44:02.557 --> 44:04.308
That's different.
That's different.

44:04.308 --> 44:05.852
H-How is it different?
It's way different.

44:05.852 --> 44:07.395
Yeah.
Bones to biscuits.

44:07.395 --> 44:08.855
I can't believe
that I'm the only one.

44:08.855 --> 44:10.064
What, you went down on a...

44:10.064 --> 44:11.649

Ah, yeah, yeah.

44:13.067 --> 44:14.360
Oh, yeah, that's the twos.

BUG, HUNTER and MAGGIE:
Eat poop.

44:21.617 --> 44:23.035
Definitely eat poop.

44:23.035 --> 44:24.453
Okay.
But I didn't even get to...

44:24.453 --> 44:25.746
It doesn't matter. I like poop.

That's just called

44:31.752 --> 44:33.212

Regular style.

44:33.212 --> 44:34.338
I mean, is there another style,

44:34.338 --> 44:35.673
or do we only have one style?

44:35.673 --> 44:36.924
I only know
one style of fucking,

44:36.924 --> 44:38.175

my whole life.

44:38.175 --> 44:39.760
Then what's human style?

44:39.760 --> 44:41.262
In human style,
the boy pretends to be the dog

44:41.262 --> 44:43.055
and the girl pretends
to be the couch.

44:43.055 --> 44:44.307

Hello, Bug.

46:39.922 --> 46:41.215
What you doing out here?

46:41.215 --> 46:42.383
We need to talk.

46:42.383 --> 46:44.969
Wait, Maggie.
You look different.

46:44.969 --> 46:46.137
Really?

46:46.137 --> 46:48.389
Oh, shit.
You look different, too.

Doug!

How's it going?

47:07.825 --> 47:09.243
Not great.

47:09.243 --> 47:10.995
Just giving it one last shave,

47:10.995 --> 47:13.748

you're planning to bite it off.

a surprise.

- Sorry, Daddy.
- Oh!

47:19.837 --> 47:21.380
My son, the gnome.

47:21.380 --> 47:23.090
- We're done, Bug.
- What?

47:23.090 --> 47:25.259
- I'm seeing someone else now.
- Who?

47:26.302 --> 47:27.595
You kidding me? Him?

47:27.595 --> 47:29.305
Hey, go fuck yourself, man!

I have both parts!

47:36.979 --> 47:38.397
Oh, fuck you, narrator dog.

47:38.397 --> 47:39.440
He said.

47:39.440 --> 47:41.192
Stop saying, "He said."

47:41.984 --> 47:43.527
He replied.

47:43.527 --> 47:46.113
I always had such high hopes
for you, Reggie.

47:46.113 --> 47:48.032
I just wanted you to be a...

47:48.032 --> 47:50.409

47:51.410 --> 47:53.704
All I ever wanted
was to be a good boy.

47:53.704 --> 47:55.122
Goodbye, Reggie.

47:57.041 --> 47:58.918
Wait! Doug, come back!

47:58.918 --> 48:00.544

48:44.130 --> 48:45.798
My bad. I got to go pee.

48:45.798 --> 48:47.675

Reggie?

48:47.675 --> 48:48.968

48:48.968 --> 48:50.344
What are you talking about?
What is that?

48:50.344 --> 48:51.387
Yeah, what is that?

48:51.387 --> 48:53.347
Oh, my God. That's an ear.

48:54.056 --> 48:56.433
- An ear?
- Holy fucking shit.

48:56.433 --> 48:58.853
They were toys. Guys,
where are the goddamn toys?

48:58.853 --> 49:01.355
This is not real.
This is not real.

49:01.355 --> 49:02.565
Th-This is real.

49:02.565 --> 49:04.358
This is real. Oh, my God!

49:04.358 --> 49:05.693

49:05.693 --> 49:07.027

49:07.027 --> 49:09.071
Oh, God.
There's fur in the barf.

49:09.071 --> 49:11.282
We're fucking murderers!
Oh, my God, now I'm gonna barf.

49:11.282 --> 49:13.200
Holy fuck. Holy fuck.
This can't be happening.

49:13.200 --> 49:14.618
Hang in there. Stay with me.

49:14.618 --> 49:15.828
I-I'll fix you.

49:15.828 --> 49:17.329
Bug, what are you doing?

49:17.329 --> 49:18.831
What it look like I'm doing?

49:18.831 --> 49:20.875
I'm getting rid of
the evidence. Nobody can know!

49:29.258 --> 49:33.846
Um, we are gathered here today
to say goodbye to the bunnies.

49:33.846 --> 49:36.056
Honestly, what we did
was an accident.

49:36.056 --> 49:37.766
- Absolutely.
- Mm-hmm. -Right.

49:37.766 --> 49:40.394
And I know that if we weren't
confused from the food we ate

49:40.394 --> 49:43.355
we would have never mauled you,
tore all your limbs off

49:43.355 --> 49:46.775
and shook your corpses around
while giggling gleefully...

49:46.775 --> 49:48.152
by accident.

49:48.152 --> 49:49.904
So, bless you, bunnies.

49:49.904 --> 49:50.988
- Yes. Sorry.
- Bless you.

49:50.988 --> 49:52.281
- So sorry.
- Sorry.

49:52.281 --> 49:53.824
- Amen.
- All right, that's it.

49:55.201 --> 49:56.869

49:56.869 --> 49:58.495
Not one fucking word.

49:58.495 --> 50:00.748

- Oh, shit. The cops.

50:00.748 --> 50:02.291
"Oh, shit" is right, motherfucker.

50:02.291 --> 50:04.585
Wait, wh-what did we do?
We're innocent. I promise.

50:04.585 --> 50:06.003
- Sit!
- I am.

50:06.003 --> 50:08.214
On the ground. Lay down,
paws where I can see 'em.

50:08.214 --> 50:10.007
- We are laying down.
- Search these bitches.

50:10.007 --> 50:11.425
They're hiding something.

50:11.425 --> 50:13.177

- Calm down. I got this.

- MAGGIE, REGGIE, HUNTER: Bug!

50:20.059 --> 50:21.685
What?
Everybody, shut the fuck up.

50:21.685 --> 50:24.271
We're looking for a lost
Girl Scout, Riley Anderson,

50:24.271 --> 50:25.940
age eight in human years.

50:25.940 --> 50:27.983
Wandered away from her campsite
two days ago.

50:27.983 --> 50:30.110
Thought you dogs might have
some contact with her.

50:30.110 --> 50:31.695
I've got nothing, sir.

50:31.695 --> 50:33.447
But it smells like you haven't.
Let's move out.

50:33.447 --> 50:35.032
Wait, wait. I could help.

50:35.032 --> 50:37.201
I'm sorry, I don't really want
to be that bitch,

50:37.201 --> 50:39.286
but I'm actually really good
at sniffing,

50:39.286 --> 50:42.122
and I'd be happy to assist
in finding this lost girl.

50:42.122 --> 50:45.709
Adorable. Yeah, no, thanks,
Australian shep-turd.

50:45.709 --> 50:47.419
Excuse me,
but you really shouldn't

50:47.419 --> 50:48.796

50:48.796 --> 50:51.006
And what the fuck
are you gonna do about it?

50:51.006 --> 50:52.675
I-I will do nothing
the fuck about it.

50:52.675 --> 50:54.343

50:58.639 --> 51:01.433
Holy mother-flipping shit!

51:01.433 --> 51:03.143
I didn't recognize you
with the cone.

51:03.143 --> 51:04.895
Yeah, yeah, I got a cone now.

51:04.895 --> 51:06.146
Bring it in, bro.

51:06.146 --> 51:07.523
- Buddy!
- Give us some.

51:07.523 --> 51:09.024
God, hey, well,
I should've known,

51:09.024 --> 51:10.651
'cause your butthole smells
exactly the same.

51:10.651 --> 51:12.569
You know, I'll never
forget this butthole.

51:12.569 --> 51:13.737
- The fuck?
- You know this guy?

51:13.737 --> 51:15.155
You kidding me?

51:15.155 --> 51:17.241
This fucker and I went
to the academy together.

51:17.241 --> 51:19.702
Everything I know, I learned
from this son of a bitch.

51:19.702 --> 51:21.537
Technically, we're all
sons of bitches, sir.

51:21.537 --> 51:22.663
Shut up.

51:22.663 --> 51:24.373
Hey, so where'd you
end up, brother?

51:24.373 --> 51:26.292
Drug sniffing, bomb detection?
What are we talking about?

51:26.292 --> 51:29.545
Oh, um, well, I take care
of dying humans.

51:29.545 --> 51:32.673
Oh. Well, I mean, that's not
the end of the world, I guess.

51:32.673 --> 51:34.591
Well, for them it is.

51:34.591 --> 51:36.176
Well, hey, guys.

51:36.176 --> 51:37.803
You found some strays, Rolf?

51:37.803 --> 51:39.847
Huh? Good job.

51:39.847 --> 51:41.515
So, what are you fuckers doing
out here, huh?

51:41.515 --> 51:43.684
Oh, uh, well,
it's a long story.

51:43.684 --> 51:44.852
We're gonna bite
a guy's dick off.

51:44.852 --> 51:46.228
It's actually a short story.

51:46.228 --> 51:47.646
Nice.
Man, when I joined the force,

51:47.646 --> 51:49.273
you could bite dicks
left and right.

51:49.273 --> 51:50.941
Nowadays, I chomp a dick,

51:50.941 --> 51:52.818
I got to fill out
two weeks of paperwork.

51:52.818 --> 51:55.946
Can I get an AC unit
down to Old Forest Road 54?

51:55.946 --> 51:57.698
We're trying to get
to the devil in the sky.

51:57.698 --> 51:58.782
Does that sound familiar?

51:58.782 --> 52:00.617
Devil in the sky? Yeah.

52:00.617 --> 52:02.286
You stick with us,
we'll show you the way.

52:02.286 --> 52:04.747
- Wow. Really?
- Sure thing, rat boy.

52:05.622 --> 52:07.541
Let's not wait so long
next time, huh?

52:07.541 --> 52:08.876
What's it been, seven years?

52:08.876 --> 52:10.377
I think just one,
but every year

52:10.377 --> 52:11.962
feels like seven to us,
so that makes sense.

52:11.962 --> 52:13.547
Okay, listen. We got to get
our story straight.

52:13.547 --> 52:14.798
- Uh-huh.
- It was a possum

52:14.798 --> 52:16.091
who killed all the bunnies,
got it?

52:16.091 --> 52:17.384
Wait, what's the possum's name?

52:17.384 --> 52:18.719
Uh, Greg.

52:18.719 --> 52:21.096
That's not a believable name
for a possum.

52:21.096 --> 52:22.556
Ooh, can it be Monty?

52:22.556 --> 52:24.933
- Hey, Cath.
- Steve. Thanks for coming over.

52:24.933 --> 52:27.102
Hey, little guy. Want a treat?

52:27.102 --> 52:28.645
Treats! I love treats!

52:28.645 --> 52:31.482
Oh, my goodness.
Does somebody want a treat?

52:31.482 --> 52:33.317
This one's all for you.
I got tons of treats.

52:33.317 --> 52:34.735
Reggie, it's a trap!

52:34.735 --> 52:36.487
- Hey!

52:36.487 --> 52:39.323
Hey, hey! Those bunnies
were dead when we found 'em!

52:39.323 --> 52:41.575
It was a possum named,
uh, Greg or-or...

52:41.575 --> 52:43.577
Monty!
His name was Monty, not Greg!

52:43.577 --> 52:45.871
No choice. They threatened us!

52:45.871 --> 52:47.998
But, Rolf,
I thought we were pals.

52:47.998 --> 52:49.500
Sorry, old friend.
The law's the law.

52:49.500 --> 52:50.876
You know how it is.

52:50.876 --> 52:53.003
What a sadistic fuck.

52:53.003 --> 52:55.422
Hey, calm down, sweetie pie.
You'll all be fine.

52:55.422 --> 52:57.216
You got tags,
they'll send you home.

53:00.219 --> 53:02.096
- Whoa, fresh meat.
- Hey, big boy.

53:02.096 --> 53:04.890
- I like the mouth on that one.
- Mm, we gonna cuddle real hard!

53:04.890 --> 53:07.184
Hey, bitch. Hey, little bitch.
-

53:07.184 --> 53:09.436
Guys, we got to get
out of here.

53:09.436 --> 53:10.938
We're running out of time.

53:10.938 --> 53:12.689
- Where even are we?
- Nowhere good.

53:12.689 --> 53:14.775
No, no, no, no, no.
I can't be here.

53:14.775 --> 53:15.943
I can't. Not this again.

53:15.943 --> 53:17.528
Come on, mate. We'll be fine.

53:17.528 --> 53:19.363
Yeah, Rolf told us
they'll just send us home.

53:19.363 --> 53:20.948
- It'll be all right.
- They only send you home

53:20.948 --> 53:22.658
if you got a home
to go back to.

53:22.658 --> 53:24.243
And do you know
what these people do

53:24.243 --> 53:26.453
to dogs that don't have one,
Hunter? Huh?

53:26.453 --> 53:29.289
Do you have any idea
what they're about to do to me?

53:29.289 --> 53:30.707
What they're about
to do to Reg?

53:30.707 --> 53:32.167
Calm down, Bug.
We'll figure this out.

53:32.167 --> 53:33.710
There ain't nothing
to figure out, Maggie.

53:33.710 --> 53:35.629
These humans caught us,
and now we are fucked!

53:35.629 --> 53:37.089
Bug, you don't know that.

53:37.089 --> 53:38.382
Yeah. Uh, I mean, Bug,

53:38.382 --> 53:40.384
you say you know
so much about humans,

53:40.384 --> 53:41.844
but you don't really know them, either.

53:41.844 --> 53:43.512
I mean, you've never
had an owner.

53:43.512 --> 53:44.680
You never had a Jenna.

53:44.680 --> 53:45.973
You never had a Doug.

53:45.973 --> 53:46.974
I had an Emma.

53:46.974 --> 53:48.475
- What?

53:48.475 --> 53:49.935
Whoa, Bug.

53:49.935 --> 53:51.311
You had an owner?

53:51.311 --> 53:52.938
Yeah.

53:52.938 --> 53:58.110
And I told myself that I would
never say her name again,

53:58.110 --> 54:00.571
but y'all need to hear this.

54:00.571 --> 54:01.864
- No.
- No? Okay.

54:01.864 --> 54:03.574
I don't remember everything,

54:03.574 --> 54:05.742
but I remember the day
she got me out of there.

54:05.742 --> 54:07.911
-  This one.

54:07.911 --> 54:09.413
He's a cute little bugger.

54:09.413 --> 54:11.123
Cute little bug.

54:11.123 --> 54:13.083
♪ When we were on top... ♪

54:13.083 --> 54:15.294
We did everything together.

54:15.294 --> 54:16.503
We played all day,

54:16.503 --> 54:18.922
and no matter how stupid
I acted,

54:18.922 --> 54:20.841
- she always laughed.

54:20.841 --> 54:22.176
Trick or treat.

54:22.176 --> 54:23.886
We even did this thing I hated

54:23.886 --> 54:26.180
where she would dress us up
in super weird clothes

54:26.180 --> 54:28.849
and ask the neighbors
to give us that chocolate

54:28.849 --> 54:31.185
- humans make from dog poop.
- Oh, oh, not for you, honey.

54:32.561 --> 54:34.354
It's okay. It's just a storm.

54:34.354 --> 54:36.523
But even better
than all the fun we had

54:36.523 --> 54:38.358
is, uh, the way
she made me feel.

54:38.358 --> 54:39.985
I love you.

54:39.985 --> 54:43.322
When she said that,
I felt so special.

54:43.322 --> 54:44.781
And then it was usually
followed by

54:44.781 --> 54:47.159
these incredible
belly scratches.

54:47.159 --> 54:49.077
No one ever made my leg
kick like that.

54:49.077 --> 54:51.288
Except for this one night
with this raccoon

54:51.288 --> 54:54.124
I don't like to talk about,
but, uh... anyway. -

54:54.917 --> 54:58.295
But then I made a mistake.

55:00.506 --> 55:02.466
It was a blur.

55:03.383 --> 55:06.553
I didn't even know what I did
until it was too late.

55:06.553 --> 55:08.805
Say goodbye to Bug.

55:15.437 --> 55:18.565
I thought I was getting
put in time-out or something,

55:18.565 --> 55:22.069
but... but the place
she sent me to...

55:23.529 --> 55:25.948
...the time-outs there
never end.

55:26.782 --> 55:28.617
Whoa!

55:33.288 --> 55:35.415
I never saw her again.

55:35.415 --> 55:38.835
After all we had been through--
everything she made me feel,

55:38.835 --> 55:42.673
everything I thought
I made her feel--

55:42.673 --> 55:44.299
just nothing.

55:44.299 --> 55:45.926
We did so much together.

55:45.926 --> 55:48.262
She taught me so many tricks.

55:48.262 --> 55:53.100
But the one trick she never
wanted me to learn was: stay.

55:54.518 --> 55:56.061
I think I zoned out
around the middle part.

55:56.061 --> 55:57.646
Can you tell
the middle part again?

55:57.646 --> 55:59.940
Hunter, I'm not gonna
tell the middle part again.

55:59.940 --> 56:01.733
I'm sorry, Bug. I had no idea.

56:01.733 --> 56:03.860
Don't be sorry, Reg.
Be thankful.

56:03.860 --> 56:05.946
'Cause you got a chance
to make this right.

56:05.946 --> 56:10.075
Oh, what I wouldn't give
to bite this girl in the dick.

56:10.075 --> 56:12.786
But, you know, she's six, and I
don't know where she lives now,

56:12.786 --> 56:15.455
and she's a girl and doesn't
even have a dick, but still.

56:15.455 --> 56:18.333
Listen, what we're doing
isn't just about Doug.

56:18.333 --> 56:20.711
We're doing this
for all of them.

56:20.711 --> 56:23.088
For every single one
of those humans

56:23.088 --> 56:25.716
who treated us like shit.

56:25.716 --> 56:28.468
Man, biggest mistake
of my life.

56:28.468 --> 56:30.887
Yeah. I'd regret that bite, too.

56:30.887 --> 56:32.347
The bite? No.

56:32.347 --> 56:33.932
I'm talking about her.

56:33.932 --> 56:35.809
She's the mistake, not the...

56:35.809 --> 56:37.102
Okay, well, we can talk about

56:37.102 --> 56:38.645
getting back at your exes
all we want,

56:38.645 --> 56:40.981
but none of that matters
if we can't get out of here.

56:40.981 --> 56:44.359
Guys, what if we can
get the key?

56:51.658 --> 56:53.035
Oh, no.

56:53.035 --> 56:55.871
We'd need, like,
a super long pole to hook it.

56:59.082 --> 57:01.251
Why is everyone looking at me?

57:05.172 --> 57:06.965
Come on, Hunter, you can do it.

57:08.550 --> 57:10.135
Dude, you're so close.

57:10.135 --> 57:11.428
Just a little more.

57:11.428 --> 57:13.180
Come on, get hornier.
You can do it.

57:13.180 --> 57:14.681
This is all I got.

57:14.681 --> 57:16.850
Maggie, come on. Excite him.

57:17.684 --> 57:19.770
Hunter, this has been

57:19.770 --> 57:24.024
a really long, hard trip,

57:24.024 --> 57:26.652
but the thing
that keeps me panting

57:26.652 --> 57:31.490
is thinking about us doing it,
regular style.

57:31.490 --> 57:33.450
Oh, boy. It-It's working.

57:33.450 --> 57:35.702
Keep talking, Maggie.
More sexy stuff.

57:35.702 --> 57:36.953
Just picture me,

57:36.953 --> 57:40.165
all eight nipples rock hard,

57:40.165 --> 57:44.628
and I'm wearing nothing but...
the cone.

57:46.630 --> 57:47.964
You're doing it, Hunter!

57:47.964 --> 57:49.383
Come on, Hunter.

57:49.383 --> 57:51.093
Use that dick of yours.

57:51.093 --> 57:52.302
Yes, Hunter!

57:52.302 --> 57:54.971
Hunter! Hunter!

57:54.971 --> 57:57.099
Hunter! Hunter!

57:57.099 --> 58:00.977
Hunter! Hunter! Hunter! Hunter!

58:00.977 --> 58:03.063
Hunter!

58:03.063 --> 58:04.690
Sorry, guys. It's hopeless.

58:04.690 --> 58:06.108
Ugh. Hunter.

58:06.108 --> 58:07.984
Shit. Really thought
that was gonna work.

58:07.984 --> 58:10.070
Sorry my dick let you down.

58:10.070 --> 58:11.947
Wait. I've got it.

58:11.947 --> 58:14.324
What's the one thing
humans are obsessed with?

58:14.324 --> 58:15.492
Uh, themselves.

58:15.492 --> 58:16.743
- Painting their faces.
- Dying.

58:16.743 --> 58:18.537
No. Bug, you said it yourself.

58:18.537 --> 58:22.499
What's the thing humans are
most obsessed with about dogs?

58:22.499 --> 58:24.501
- Our shit.
- Yes.

58:24.501 --> 58:26.461
Every single time we shit,
what do they do?

58:26.461 --> 58:27.838
They come and bag it up.

58:27.838 --> 58:29.673
- Yeah.
- That's right. Once this place

58:29.673 --> 58:32.175
gets all poopy,
Willy comes in and bags it up

58:32.175 --> 58:34.428
like he's collecting it
for something. -OTHERS: Mm-hmm.

58:34.428 --> 58:35.721
- Exactly.
For chocolate.

58:35.721 --> 58:37.305
And that's our ticket
out of here.

58:37.305 --> 58:39.850
We poop until
he has to open these doors,

58:39.850 --> 58:41.852
and when he does, we charge.

58:41.852 --> 58:43.437
Good idea, Reg.
- Nice thinking, kid. I'm in.

58:43.437 --> 58:45.105
And I got a couple of shits
in the chamber.

58:45.105 --> 58:47.607
- No thanks, kid.

58:47.607 --> 58:48.900
What's wrong with you guys?

58:48.900 --> 58:50.444
Don't you want to get out
of this place?

58:50.444 --> 58:53.029
Of course. But we've been
burned so many times

58:53.029 --> 58:54.406
we're smart enough to know

58:54.406 --> 58:56.116
that we'll never get
beyond these walls

58:56.116 --> 58:58.368
without a human coming
to adopt us.

58:59.202 --> 59:01.496
Look, I get it.

59:01.496 --> 59:03.498
I've had dark moments.

59:03.498 --> 59:05.375
Moments where I felt stuck.

59:05.375 --> 59:08.670
Moments where,
even if you couldn't see it,

59:08.670 --> 59:11.965
felt like there was a wall
or a fence holding you back.

59:11.965 --> 59:14.468
Yeah, invisible magic fences.
I swear to God, that's real.

59:14.468 --> 59:17.637
But I'm here to tell you
that's garbage talk.

59:17.637 --> 59:20.682
'Cause I was lucky enough
to meet some amazing friends

59:20.682 --> 59:23.560
who taught me that
just beyond those walls

59:23.560 --> 59:26.480
is a bunch of incredible stuff
worth living for.

59:26.480 --> 59:28.148
There's lampposts to pee on.

59:28.148 --> 59:31.359
There's scraps to eat
and couches to make love to.

59:31.359 --> 59:32.778
And dead bunnies that...

59:32.778 --> 59:34.237
- I-I know nothing about.

59:34.237 --> 59:35.906
Yeah, I know nothing
about that, either.

59:35.906 --> 59:37.240
Got no clue what you're
talking about on that one.

59:37.240 --> 59:38.492
And tennis balls to fetch, and...

59:38.492 --> 59:39.868
A dick to bite off.

59:39.868 --> 59:41.995
What? Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That, too.

59:43.288 --> 59:46.583
But most importantly, there's
a life out there worth living.

59:46.583 --> 59:48.251
Whoo! Reggie!
Go, Reg!

59:48.251 --> 59:51.838
So I'm asking you, do you want
to stay here and die,

59:51.838 --> 59:55.926
or do you want to shit
your brains out and live?

59:55.926 --> 59:57.427
Live!

59:57.427 --> 59:59.012
We want to live!

59:59.012 --> 01:00:00.597
Then poop with me!

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:02.849
Poop with me to freedom!

01:01:13.169 --> 01:01:15.964

I see what's going on here.

01:01:47.162 --> 01:01:51.875
You guys think that I am

01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:54.377
a big fat fucking asshole, right?

01:01:54.377 --> 01:01:56.212
You know everything about me.

01:01:56.212 --> 01:01:59.215
You know all the things
that have happened in my life

01:01:59.215 --> 01:02:01.718
with my dad and my ex-wife.

01:02:07.057 --> 01:02:10.644
Bravo. Bravo.

01:02:10.644 --> 01:02:11.686
Oh, encore!

01:02:11.686 --> 01:02:14.522
Just kidding. It's done.

01:02:14.522 --> 01:02:17.233
We are done!

01:02:17.233 --> 01:02:18.610
- Wait, what are you...

01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:20.987
Oh, my God. Wh-Whoa.

01:02:23.406 --> 01:02:24.908
Charge!

01:02:37.003 --> 01:02:38.338
Ah, we did it!

01:02:38.338 --> 01:02:39.923
I can't believe
we shit that much!

01:02:39.923 --> 01:02:41.841
Hunter's dick! Hunter's dick!

01:02:41.841 --> 01:02:43.718
To hell with you!

01:02:52.519 --> 01:02:54.187
Thanks for your patience, folks.

01:02:54.187 --> 01:02:56.064
Really.

01:02:57.065 --> 01:02:59.359
Ooh. I'm sorry, Diane.

01:02:59.359 --> 01:03:01.486
Uh... uh...

01:03:01.486 --> 01:03:04.614
"Then poop with me to freedom."

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:06.866
- So cheesy, but I loved it.
-  What a plan.

01:03:06.866 --> 01:03:08.451
What a speech, Reg.

01:03:08.451 --> 01:03:10.620
Actually, Reginald,
I preferred the first speech.

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:13.415
You know, the one where you
convinced all of us to do this,

01:03:13.415 --> 01:03:16.418
back when you were focused
on biting Doug's dick off.

01:03:16.418 --> 01:03:18.461
Bug.
- Okay, okay, Bug, look...

01:03:18.461 --> 01:03:20.296
Oh, look!

01:03:20.296 --> 01:03:22.424
The devil in the sky.
We made it.

01:03:22.424 --> 01:03:23.967
Look at that fucking guy!

01:03:23.967 --> 01:03:26.720
Burn in hell, you
motherfucking son of a bitch.

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.096
I hate everything about him.

01:03:28.096 --> 01:03:29.723
That dumbass smile,
those shitty pants.

01:03:29.723 --> 01:03:31.599
I want to rip your nuts off
and make you watch!

01:03:31.599 --> 01:03:33.184
Stupid hat
and your stupid truck

01:03:33.184 --> 01:03:35.812
with the door
on the other side of the thing.

01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:37.147
I hate his face.

01:03:37.147 --> 01:03:38.815
I hate his personality.
I hate his bag.

01:03:38.815 --> 01:03:41.109
He smells like
a thousand different houses,

01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:43.653
and I can't trust that.

01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:46.281
Anyways, good job, guys.
The final landmark.

01:03:46.281 --> 01:03:47.991
- Yeah. That's right.
- And right on schedule.

01:03:47.991 --> 01:03:50.076
Yeah, barely. You remember
which way to go from here?

01:03:50.076 --> 01:03:54.414
Uh, yeah, we just... we just
stay on this road for now.

01:03:54.414 --> 01:03:55.498
Good. Let's move.

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:56.458
- All right.
Great.

01:03:56.458 --> 01:03:57.667
W-Wait, wait, wait.

01:03:57.667 --> 01:03:59.002
One second. Can't leave yet.

01:03:59.002 --> 01:04:00.211
- Huh?
- What's up, Reg?

01:04:00.211 --> 01:04:01.629
Where is it?

01:04:01.629 --> 01:04:03.423
Oh, there.

01:04:04.924 --> 01:04:06.259
All right. Let's go, guys.

01:04:06.259 --> 01:04:08.595
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Hold on a second.

01:04:08.595 --> 01:04:10.722
Why couldn't you leave
without the ball, Reggie?

01:04:10.722 --> 01:04:13.475
I don't know.
I-I just like tennis balls.

01:04:13.475 --> 01:04:15.769
I know ball guys.
You're not a ball guy.

01:04:15.769 --> 01:04:17.937
Well, you don't know
everything about me.

01:04:17.937 --> 01:04:20.774
Well, I'm learning
a little more right now.

01:04:20.774 --> 01:04:22.275
Drop the ball, Reg.

01:04:22.275 --> 01:04:23.860
What? No.

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:25.862
Drop the fucking ball.

01:04:25.862 --> 01:04:28.782
- Leave it.
- I'm not gonna leave the ball.

01:04:28.782 --> 01:04:30.075
- Drop the ball!
- No.

01:04:30.075 --> 01:04:31.367
Reggie, you drop
that goddamn ball!

01:04:31.367 --> 01:04:33.036
- No.
- You don't even like balls!

01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:34.662
Doug likes balls!

01:04:34.662 --> 01:04:36.122
- Doug?

01:04:36.122 --> 01:04:37.207
Oh, Reg.

01:04:37.207 --> 01:04:38.958
I don't know why, but he does.

01:04:38.958 --> 01:04:40.877
And when we play the game
fetch-and-fuck,

01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:44.130
it always ends when I come home
and bring him back a ball.

01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:46.841
So I know he's expecting it,
and I'm not gonna let him down.

01:04:46.841 --> 01:04:48.760
- Goddamn it.
- So, when you told me

01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:51.638
you didn't know how you were
gonna bite Doug in the dick,

01:04:51.638 --> 01:04:54.140
the real reason you don't know
is because...

01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:56.226
You're not gonna bite Doug
in the dick. -

01:04:56.226 --> 01:05:00.063
Look, when we first set out,
I was totally into the plan.

01:05:00.063 --> 01:05:02.023
But the closer we got to Doug,

01:05:02.023 --> 01:05:05.652
the more I realize
that I miss him.

01:05:05.652 --> 01:05:07.779
And I think he misses me, too.

01:05:07.779 --> 01:05:08.988
Reggie, don't do this.

01:05:08.988 --> 01:05:10.824
You deserve so much better
than him.

01:05:10.824 --> 01:05:12.200
I don't, Hunter.

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:13.576
I really don't.

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:15.161
You know why Doug abandoned me?

01:05:15.161 --> 01:05:17.664
Because I was the problem
in our relationship.

01:05:17.664 --> 01:05:18.998
I ate his shoes.

01:05:18.998 --> 01:05:20.750
I woke him up so early
every day

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:22.252
because I needed to pee.

01:05:22.252 --> 01:05:23.711
And I pooped on the rug.

01:05:23.711 --> 01:05:25.588
We've all pooped on the rug, Reggie.

01:05:25.588 --> 01:05:28.299
Oh, did you roll in it, Maggie?
Did you roll in the poop?

01:05:28.299 --> 01:05:30.718
Because guess what,
I rolled in the poop.

01:05:30.718 --> 01:05:32.053
Okay, that's not great.

01:05:32.053 --> 01:05:34.013
God, I can't believe
it took me this long

01:05:34.013 --> 01:05:37.058
to realize this-- that every
time he called me a bad dog,

01:05:37.058 --> 01:05:38.601
he was absolutely right.

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:40.103
It was all my fault.

01:05:40.103 --> 01:05:41.396
Wow.

01:05:41.396 --> 01:05:42.689
Well, I'm not gonna be
a bad dog anymore.

01:05:42.689 --> 01:05:44.691
It's time for me
to be a good boy.

01:05:44.691 --> 01:05:48.486
Jesus, I cannot believe that I
risked my life for this asshole

01:05:48.486 --> 01:05:51.406
just so he could go back
and get with another asshole.

01:05:51.406 --> 01:05:54.075
I did all of this for you, Reggie.

01:05:54.075 --> 01:05:55.493
You didn't do this for me.

01:05:55.493 --> 01:05:57.620
You said it yourself--
this isn't about Doug.

01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:59.622
This is about
every single one of them

01:05:59.622 --> 01:06:01.374
who treated us like shit.

01:06:01.374 --> 01:06:02.584
This is about Emma.

01:06:02.584 --> 01:06:04.627
- Reggie.
- Fuck you.

01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:06.754
Hey, how about
rule number three, Bug?

01:06:06.754 --> 01:06:08.006
You're on your own?

01:06:08.006 --> 01:06:09.465
Well, then what were we?

01:06:09.465 --> 01:06:11.217
Wow. -I don't think
you really want to be a stray.

01:06:11.217 --> 01:06:12.635
I think you're sad and lonely.

01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:14.220
Can you believe
this fucking guy?

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:16.556
And I think the only reason
you claim to hate humans

01:06:16.556 --> 01:06:19.100
is because, if you ever stop
to think about what happened,

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:22.854
you'd realize that Emma
didn't fuck it up; you did.

01:06:22.854 --> 01:06:24.397
Get the fuck away from me.

01:06:24.397 --> 01:06:26.316
Believe me, I-I fucked up
with my owner, too,

01:06:26.316 --> 01:06:28.985
so thank you for helping me
realize I was the problem.

01:06:28.985 --> 01:06:31.863
Only difference is
I have a chance to fix it

01:06:31.863 --> 01:06:34.073
and not end up like you.

01:06:35.283 --> 01:06:36.618
Hey, hey, hey,
what are you doing?

01:06:36.618 --> 01:06:37.827
- Guys, guys, stop.
- Guys, stop it.

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:39.287
- Guys! -Guys, come on.
- Come on!

01:06:39.287 --> 01:06:40.872
- Give me this fucking thing.
- Give it back!

01:06:40.872 --> 01:06:42.290
- Bug.
Guys.

01:06:42.290 --> 01:06:43.416
Doug gave me that!
Give that back!

01:06:43.416 --> 01:06:45.001
- I know he did.
- No!

01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:46.920
Stop it. Stop.
Bug, don't do that.

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:49.380
That's what I think
about you and your owner.

01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:51.257
Go fuck yourself, Reggie!

01:06:51.257 --> 01:06:53.509
You two deserve each other.

01:07:01.935 --> 01:07:03.728
- Reggie, don't do this!
- Reg.

01:07:03.728 --> 01:07:06.022
I hope he's already left
without you.

01:07:11.194 --> 01:07:13.071
Man.

01:07:13.071 --> 01:07:16.783
I really thought my dick
was gonna hook those keys.

01:07:16.783 --> 01:07:20.745
Um, but this is also a bummer.

01:07:29.087 --> 01:07:31.381
Bug, we can't go back.

01:07:31.381 --> 01:07:32.674
Sure, we can.

01:07:32.674 --> 01:07:34.759
The devil in the sky,
cone, hamster wheel,

01:07:34.759 --> 01:07:36.761
just in the opposite order
of how we came.

01:07:36.761 --> 01:07:38.263
No dead bunnies this time.

01:07:38.263 --> 01:07:39.806
Bug, she means
we can't leave him like this.

01:07:39.806 --> 01:07:42.350
First off, Hunter,
we didn't leave him.

01:07:42.350 --> 01:07:43.768
He left us.

01:07:43.768 --> 01:07:45.937
Second, we don't know
the rest of the way

01:07:45.937 --> 01:07:47.397
back to Doug's place anyway.

01:07:47.397 --> 01:07:49.774
And third, I'm not just
gonna hang around here

01:07:49.774 --> 01:07:51.317
and let some dickless bird

01:07:51.317 --> 01:07:53.486
swoop in on my girlfriend
while I'm gone.

01:07:53.486 --> 01:07:55.113
- What?
-  Look,

01:07:55.113 --> 01:07:57.115
if there's one thing
that the asshole got right,

01:07:57.115 --> 01:07:59.993
it's that I have been
wasting my time with you guys.

01:07:59.993 --> 01:08:02.996
I'm a stray, and I should start
acting like one.

01:08:02.996 --> 01:08:04.872
- Wait, where are you going?
- I don't know.

01:08:04.872 --> 01:08:07.083
- I'm about to go do some nunya.
- What's nunya?

01:08:07.083 --> 01:08:09.085
- Nunya fucking business!
Oh, yeah,

01:08:09.085 --> 01:08:10.670
I walked right into that one.

01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:12.839
Let's go home, Hunter.

01:08:16.551 --> 01:08:18.386
Talking about I'm lonely.
Talking about I'm scared.

01:08:18.386 --> 01:08:20.221
Fuck does he think
he's talking about?

01:08:20.221 --> 01:08:22.348
I'm-a tell you right now,
I ain't lonely,

01:08:22.348 --> 01:08:23.933
and I damn sure ain't scared.

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:25.727
Fuck you, leaf.

01:08:25.727 --> 01:08:27.353
End up like me?

01:08:27.353 --> 01:08:29.689
I pissed on two cars
and three houses last week.

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:31.733
That's right,
I'm a three-year-old dog,

01:08:31.733 --> 01:08:33.359
and I'm already a homeowner.

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:34.736
I'm living
the motherfucking dream, hmm?

01:08:34.736 --> 01:08:36.529
And I'm not scared to be alone.

01:08:36.529 --> 01:08:38.656
Matter of fact,
I ain't scared of anything.

01:08:40.116 --> 01:08:41.117
Who's that?

01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:42.410
Don't come closer.

01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:45.496
I-I, uh... I'm crazy.
I fuck trash!

01:09:00.511 --> 01:09:02.722
Nope, not doing this.

01:09:02.722 --> 01:09:04.098
Just walk away, Bug.

01:09:04.098 --> 01:09:07.268
Little girls like Emma suck,
and you know it.

01:09:13.483 --> 01:09:15.443
Don't listen to her, man.
Don't listen to her.

01:09:15.443 --> 01:09:17.528
Another fucking narcissist

01:09:17.528 --> 01:09:19.113
putting her needs
above your own.

01:09:19.113 --> 01:09:21.074
You've been down
this fucking road before, man.

01:09:21.074 --> 01:09:23.117
Just... just...

01:09:23.117 --> 01:09:25.286
Goddamn it.

01:09:32.126 --> 01:09:34.504
Hey there.

01:09:34.504 --> 01:09:37.173
What are you doing out here
all alone?

01:09:37.882 --> 01:09:39.592
Did you get lost like me?

01:09:39.592 --> 01:09:40.802
It's gonna be okay.

01:09:40.802 --> 01:09:42.178
Holy shit. Wait!

01:09:42.178 --> 01:09:43.388
You're the girl
that everyone's looking for.

01:09:43.388 --> 01:09:44.514
Holy shit.

01:09:44.514 --> 01:09:46.933
I found her! I found her!

01:09:46.933 --> 01:09:48.601
S-Somebody, please help!

01:09:48.601 --> 01:09:49.852
I found the girl!

01:09:49.852 --> 01:09:52.313
- That's Bug.
- Bug! Where are you?

01:09:52.313 --> 01:09:53.981
Let's go.

01:09:56.609 --> 01:09:58.194
I see him!

01:09:59.529 --> 01:10:00.780
I can't believe
you found the girl.

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:02.365
Oh, my God, Bug.

01:10:02.365 --> 01:10:04.867
Come on. We got to get her
some help. She's in bad shape.

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:06.494
Help! Over here!
Over here!

01:10:06.494 --> 01:10:07.829
We found her! Help!

01:10:07.829 --> 01:10:10.498
- Help! Help!
- Rolf, you dickhead! Help!

01:10:13.751 --> 01:10:15.795
Lost kid! Let's move!

01:10:15.795 --> 01:10:17.046
- Over here!
- Rolf! -Help!

01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:18.256
- Here they come.
Over here.

01:10:18.256 --> 01:10:20.216
Munchkin, check the girl.

01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:22.552
Hell of a job,
Hunter and small dogs.

01:10:22.552 --> 01:10:25.555
- Didn't know you had it in you.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Riley!

01:10:25.555 --> 01:10:27.932
Riley, here you are.
Good dog. Good dog.

01:10:27.932 --> 01:10:29.267
You're okay.

01:10:29.267 --> 01:10:30.476
I'm not even gonna ask

01:10:30.476 --> 01:10:32.311
how you ended up
back in these woods.

01:10:32.311 --> 01:10:35.648
All I'll ask is:
How can I repay you?

01:10:36.816 --> 01:10:39.527
You can help save
my best friend.

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:44.407
Oh, what am I gonna say?
What am I gonna say?

01:10:44.407 --> 01:10:47.368
Okay, I should probably
rehearse this.

01:10:47.368 --> 01:10:48.494
Hey, Doug.

01:10:48.494 --> 01:10:49.912
Hey, shitbag.

01:10:49.912 --> 01:10:51.247
What have you been up to?

01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:52.665
Mostly masturbating.

01:10:52.665 --> 01:10:54.834
Oh, cool. Classic Doug.

01:10:54.834 --> 01:10:56.878
So, I owe you an apology.

01:10:56.878 --> 01:10:58.212
Okay.

01:10:58.212 --> 01:10:59.505
You were totally right

01:10:59.505 --> 01:11:00.756
to ditch me in that alley.

01:11:00.756 --> 01:11:02.008
I mean, I was terrible.

01:11:02.008 --> 01:11:03.342
Agreed.

01:11:03.342 --> 01:11:05.011
But I was wondering, um,

01:11:05.011 --> 01:11:07.722
if we could maybe make
some changes when I'm back.

01:11:07.722 --> 01:11:09.682
Like, maybe we could
do walks now

01:11:09.682 --> 01:11:12.768
and possibly increase
pee breaks to twice a day

01:11:12.768 --> 01:11:15.855
and maybe, if you feel like it,
you could call me a...

01:11:15.855 --> 01:11:18.608
a good boy
every once in a while.

01:11:23.404 --> 01:11:25.781
Ugh, this is stupid.

01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:30.828
What you mean,
you can't track him down?

01:11:30.828 --> 01:11:32.288
You're sniff dogs.
That's what you do, right?

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:34.165
Yeah, come on, Rolf,
they taught us that.

01:11:34.165 --> 01:11:35.583
It's impossible.

01:11:35.583 --> 01:11:37.293
We can't track him without
knowing his scent first.

01:11:37.293 --> 01:11:39.170
Did you get any whiff of him
yesterday, Munchkin?

01:11:39.170 --> 01:11:40.963
Nothing I can recall, sir.

01:11:40.963 --> 01:11:42.590
- Wait! The bandanna!
- Come again.

01:11:42.590 --> 01:11:44.258
We can get his scent
from the bandanna.

01:11:44.258 --> 01:11:46.219
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Nice, Maggie.

01:11:46.219 --> 01:11:48.429
Rolf? Hey, Rolf!

01:11:48.429 --> 01:11:50.389
- There it is!
There! There it is!

01:11:50.389 --> 01:11:52.183
There it is!

01:11:52.183 --> 01:11:53.935
Way to go, Maggie.

01:11:53.935 --> 01:11:55.436
Halt!

01:11:55.436 --> 01:11:57.522
Good God, what's that smell?

01:11:57.522 --> 01:11:58.981
Can you smell Reggie
off that thing?

01:11:58.981 --> 01:12:01.901
I'm not getting
any dog off of this, sir.

01:12:01.901 --> 01:12:03.027
Just a lot of urine.

01:12:03.027 --> 01:12:04.362
- Oh, huh. Oh, wow.
- Huh.

01:12:04.362 --> 01:12:06.030
- That's, uh, weird.
- It was Bug.

01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:07.782
And from the same patterns,
I can tell

01:12:07.782 --> 01:12:09.575
this was
a very small pee stream,

01:12:09.575 --> 01:12:12.662
indicative of a dog with
an unbelievably tiny penis.

01:12:12.662 --> 01:12:14.789
- Again, Bug.
- It ain't indicative of shit.

01:12:14.789 --> 01:12:17.333
If anything, it is indicative
of a well-shaped,

01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:20.211
sensual penis
that transcends dick size.

01:12:20.211 --> 01:12:22.255
Lots of TDU-- tiny dick urine--
over here.

01:12:22.255 --> 01:12:23.881
It would take a miracle
to pick up

01:12:23.881 --> 01:12:25.424
any dog scent
off of that thing.

01:12:25.424 --> 01:12:27.426
There you are.
What's gotten into you guys?

01:12:27.426 --> 01:12:29.262
Fuck are you doing?

01:12:29.262 --> 01:12:30.596
You'll taint the smell!

01:12:30.596 --> 01:12:32.223
I'm doing your job.

01:12:32.223 --> 01:12:33.891
Now, back the fuck off, Adolf.

01:12:33.891 --> 01:12:35.268
- Adolf?
- It's 'cause you're

01:12:35.268 --> 01:12:36.769
a German shep... Oh, whatever.

01:12:36.769 --> 01:12:38.271
I get it now. Hitler reference.

01:12:39.605 --> 01:12:41.607
Go, Maggie. Go, Maggie.

01:12:45.528 --> 01:12:47.029
I'm picking up...

01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:49.282
bitches of the night,
pizza, vomit pizza,

01:12:49.282 --> 01:12:50.908
hot dogs, all of our pee,

01:12:50.908 --> 01:12:52.868
- eagle feathers, Dennis Quaid?

01:12:52.868 --> 01:12:55.037
Squirrel sex, dead bunnies
that I know nothing about,

01:12:55.037 --> 01:12:56.539
Hunter's boner,
oh, lots of shit,

01:12:56.539 --> 01:12:58.916
a tiny Boston terrier dick and...

01:12:58.916 --> 01:13:00.626
Reggie! I got him.

01:13:00.626 --> 01:13:01.794
- Yes, Maggie.
- Let's move!

01:13:01.794 --> 01:13:02.878
Come on, let's go!

01:13:02.878 --> 01:13:04.297
Thanks, Rolf!

01:13:04.297 --> 01:13:06.549
Except for when
you fucked us over!

01:13:06.549 --> 01:13:07.925
Good luck, soldiers.

01:13:07.925 --> 01:13:10.177
And sorry
I'm such a fucking asshole!

01:13:10.177 --> 01:13:12.054
I should really work on myself.

01:14:03.397 --> 01:14:06.233
Oh, thanks
for shitting on the carpet.

01:14:06.233 --> 01:14:08.527
The fuck are you thinking, huh?

01:14:08.527 --> 01:14:12.031
Oh, you're such a stupid
little piece of shit.

01:14:20.206 --> 01:14:23.125
Can you just leave me
the fuck alone?

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:25.419
Bad dog!

01:14:31.092 --> 01:14:34.303
That's what you fucking
sound like, you piece of shit.

01:15:01.706 --> 01:15:05.042
Okay, one last shit on
the carpet, and then I'm out.

01:15:24.895 --> 01:15:26.522
Hey, Doug.

01:15:27.356 --> 01:15:29.024
Fuck.

01:15:29.024 --> 01:15:30.776
It's me, Reggie.

01:15:30.776 --> 01:15:33.863
A-And look, I-I know
you can't understand

01:15:33.863 --> 01:15:35.156
what I'm saying right now...

01:15:35.156 --> 01:15:36.532
This is not happening.

01:15:36.532 --> 01:15:39.243
...but I just want to say
how I feel.

01:15:39.243 --> 01:15:41.245
I know you didn't like me.

01:15:41.245 --> 01:15:43.164
I mean, obviously.

01:15:43.164 --> 01:15:45.207
You abandoned me in the street.

01:15:45.207 --> 01:15:48.127
But just know that
I did everything I could

01:15:48.127 --> 01:15:49.962
to make you feel loved.

01:15:49.962 --> 01:15:52.381
And I thought,
if I loved you enough,

01:15:52.381 --> 01:15:55.468
then maybe you would
love me back.

01:15:56.343 --> 01:15:58.304
But then I met new friends.

01:15:58.304 --> 01:16:02.558
I met the sweetest big dog
with just the nicest dick,

01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:05.644
the most talented,
baddest bitch in the world,

01:16:05.644 --> 01:16:08.272
and the-the tiniest, scrappiest,

01:16:08.272 --> 01:16:11.942
funniest best friend
I could ever ask for.

01:16:11.942 --> 01:16:15.780
Oh, and I met my son, too,
who's a gnome, and we had sex.

01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:17.072
But whatever.

01:16:17.072 --> 01:16:20.117
The point is
those friends showed me

01:16:20.117 --> 01:16:22.161
what real love feels like,

01:16:22.161 --> 01:16:24.747
and it's nothing
like what we had.

01:16:24.747 --> 01:16:28.209
Now I know that
I wasn't a bad dog.

01:16:28.209 --> 01:16:31.587
You were a bad man.

01:16:31.587 --> 01:16:33.589
Bad man! Bad man!

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:39.595
Goodbye, Doug.

01:16:39.595 --> 01:16:41.138
And fuck you.

01:16:47.561 --> 01:16:49.522
Now, what do I got to do

01:16:49.522 --> 01:16:52.900
to get you the fuck
out of my life?

01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:55.194
I mean, how do you
not get it, man?

01:16:55.194 --> 01:16:58.656
I drove you three hours away.

01:16:58.656 --> 01:17:00.533
I mean, how could I make it
any more clear

01:17:00.533 --> 01:17:02.535
that I don't care about you?

01:17:02.535 --> 01:17:04.703
I don't fucking love you.

01:17:04.703 --> 01:17:06.705
Goodbye forever, shitbag.

01:17:07.998 --> 01:17:11.710
Well, at least I found
someone who loved me.

01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:13.587
Pee-FFs forever.

01:17:16.423 --> 01:17:18.384
Pee-FFs forever!

01:17:18.384 --> 01:17:19.885
The fuck?

01:17:19.885 --> 01:17:21.637
Who the hell are these dogs?

01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:24.557
Jesus Christ, it's like
a fucking dog movie in here.

01:17:27.059 --> 01:17:28.394
Oh, yeah?

01:17:28.394 --> 01:17:31.230
The fuck are you gonna do
about it, cone boy?

01:17:40.823 --> 01:17:42.199
Oh, shit.

01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:49.999
Reggie, you okay?

01:17:49.999 --> 01:17:51.667
Listen, Bug, I-I'm so sorry
for what I said. I...

01:17:51.667 --> 01:17:53.210
Don't worry about that
right now.

01:17:53.210 --> 01:17:54.920
Yeah, we've got a dick
to rip off.

01:17:59.258 --> 01:18:01.135
Get the fuck off me!

01:18:01.886 --> 01:18:03.220
Fuck. What the...

01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:05.973
Get off me! Let go! Goddamn it.

01:18:05.973 --> 01:18:07.766
Ow! Fuck, my knee!

01:18:07.766 --> 01:18:09.685
- Goddamn it!

01:18:09.685 --> 01:18:12.187
Oh, you want some, huh?

01:18:14.607 --> 01:18:16.442
Oh, goddamn it!

01:18:16.442 --> 01:18:18.485
You little fuckers owe me
a microwave!

01:18:19.612 --> 01:18:21.530
Eat some foot!

01:18:22.323 --> 01:18:24.199
Aah, my foot!

01:18:28.454 --> 01:18:29.872
Shitbag.

01:18:38.589 --> 01:18:41.133
Oh, fuck, my back!

01:18:41.133 --> 01:18:42.760
Fuck! -Guys, we should
get out of here.

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:44.011
Reggie!

01:18:44.011 --> 01:18:45.846
Got you, you little shit.

01:18:45.846 --> 01:18:47.806
Well, look at you.

01:18:47.806 --> 01:18:49.850
You got yourself some friends?

01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:53.312
Let me tell you furry fucks something.

01:18:53.312 --> 01:18:56.941
Your little buddy here
ruined my life.

01:18:56.941 --> 01:19:00.486
Before him, I had
a fucking good thing going.

01:19:00.486 --> 01:19:03.614
A roof over my head,
checks from my mom,

01:19:03.614 --> 01:19:04.990
two girlfriends.

01:19:04.990 --> 01:19:08.786
Now I have no house,
no girlfriends,

01:19:08.786 --> 01:19:10.704
and I have to masturbate
all day.

01:19:10.704 --> 01:19:13.958
All right, this dog turned me
into a fucking loser!

01:19:13.958 --> 01:19:15.417
Why's he talking so much?

01:19:15.417 --> 01:19:19.505
You ever see the end
of Marley & Me? Huh?

01:19:19.505 --> 01:19:20.923
Yeah. Me, neither.

01:19:20.923 --> 01:19:23.008
It's fucking boring.

01:19:23.008 --> 01:19:26.387
But I do know that
the dog dies in the end.

01:19:26.387 --> 01:19:28.180
- I'm gonna enjoy

01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:30.724
squeezing the life out of you.

01:19:30.724 --> 01:19:32.643
Maggie, Hunter,
get in position.

01:19:32.643 --> 01:19:34.061
Got it.
Copy.

01:19:34.061 --> 01:19:35.604
'Cause you squeezed
the life out of me.

01:19:35.604 --> 01:19:37.147
Wait, what's happening?

01:19:37.147 --> 01:19:39.191
What are they doing getting in
a line like that? What...

01:19:41.694 --> 01:19:44.530

01:21:43.982 --> 01:21:45.484
Yo, Reg, I got to be
honest with you, man.

01:21:45.484 --> 01:21:46.944
I ain't think
you was gonna do that shit.

01:21:46.944 --> 01:21:48.737
You really committed to that.

01:21:48.737 --> 01:21:50.239
Yeah, that was more
graphic than I was expecting.

01:21:50.239 --> 01:21:51.490
That was almost too far.

01:21:51.490 --> 01:21:52.741
You one-upped me, for sure.

01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:54.076
I mean, I bit a girl's ankle.

01:21:54.076 --> 01:21:56.787
You ripped a man's penis off.

01:22:11.677 --> 01:22:15.013
Today is gonna be
the best day ever.

01:22:15.013 --> 01:22:16.515
How do I know that?

01:22:16.515 --> 01:22:19.226
Because every day
is the best day ever.

01:22:19.226 --> 01:22:22.688
Hunter went back to his job
at the old human home,

01:22:22.688 --> 01:22:24.648
and he didn't even need
his cone.

01:22:24.648 --> 01:22:25.899
Hey, Cone of Shame.

01:22:25.899 --> 01:22:27.484
Where's your lampshade?

01:22:27.484 --> 01:22:29.945
Actually, Bubsy,
I don't need that cone anymore,

01:22:29.945 --> 01:22:32.489
just like I don't need
any of your shit anymore.

01:22:32.489 --> 01:22:33.740
Fuck you, Bubsy.

01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:35.659
Wow. I had no idea
you felt that way.

01:22:35.659 --> 01:22:38.120
I'm sorry. I-I'm just gonna go.

01:22:39.037 --> 01:22:40.455
Fuck your mother!

01:22:40.455 --> 01:22:41.957
Fuck out of here!

01:22:41.957 --> 01:22:43.542
And he finally
found the courage

01:22:43.542 --> 01:22:45.335
to let Maggie know
how he feels about her.

01:22:45.335 --> 01:22:47.171
And now they have sex
all the time.

01:22:47.171 --> 01:22:49.715
Regular style, of course.

01:22:49.715 --> 01:22:51.508
Attaboy, Hunter.

01:22:52.759 --> 01:22:54.928
Reminds me of when I was young.

01:22:54.928 --> 01:22:57.556
You used to fuck dogs?

01:22:57.556 --> 01:22:58.724
What?

01:22:58.724 --> 01:23:00.142
And Maggie, well,

01:23:00.142 --> 01:23:02.561
she finally got
the owner she deserves.

01:23:02.561 --> 01:23:05.564
Maggie's part of
the detection squad now,

01:23:05.564 --> 01:23:07.733
and she's the best sniffer
on the team.

01:23:07.733 --> 01:23:10.444
Oh, I love the costume
you gave her.

01:23:10.444 --> 01:23:11.653
So good.

01:23:11.653 --> 01:23:13.822
Uniform. For work.

01:23:13.822 --> 01:23:15.657
And Bug's the same old Bug.

01:23:15.657 --> 01:23:17.826
With one pretty big exception.

01:23:17.826 --> 01:23:20.162
He's changed his stance
on people.

01:23:21.496 --> 01:23:24.166

one very special person.

was a bit

01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:36.720
of a learning experience
for him.

01:23:38.138 --> 01:23:39.932
Oh, baby, I love this.

01:23:39.932 --> 01:23:42.351
Your cushions are so much
tighter than Dolores's.

01:23:42.351 --> 01:23:46.104
Now, what is this fabric?
Faux suede?

01:23:46.104 --> 01:23:47.272
Hey.

01:23:47.272 --> 01:23:48.649
Oh, hey, Kevin.

01:23:49.524 --> 01:23:51.818
Come on, buddy.
No humping the couch.

01:23:53.195 --> 01:23:55.906
Nothing will ever
come between us.

01:23:56.865 --> 01:23:59.618
Yep, life is pretty damn great.

01:23:59.618 --> 01:24:01.411
So we'll see you guys tonight?

01:24:01.411 --> 01:24:02.537
- Yep.
- You know it.

01:24:02.537 --> 01:24:04.373
Scraps night.

01:24:06.833 --> 01:24:10.212
As for me,
I chose to stay a stray,

01:24:10.212 --> 01:24:12.047
and I couldn't be happier.

01:24:12.047 --> 01:24:14.216
And for any dogs in need,

01:24:14.216 --> 01:24:16.301
I'll be there
to show them the ropes.

01:24:16.301 --> 01:24:18.929
Hey there. I'm Reggie.
You got a name?

01:24:18.929 --> 01:24:21.265
Oh, hi. I'm-I'm Shitstain.

01:24:21.265 --> 01:24:24.184
No. No, no, no.
That's not your name. Trust me.

01:24:25.018 --> 01:24:27.020
Rule number one
of being a stray:

01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:29.314
You want something,
you pee on it.

01:24:29.314 --> 01:24:31.149
And whatever you pee on
is yours.

01:24:31.149 --> 01:24:33.318
Oh. How about this lamppost?

01:24:33.318 --> 01:24:35.946
- That's mine!
- Oh. Okay.

01:24:35.946 --> 01:24:37.239
Rule number two:

01:24:37.239 --> 01:24:39.074
You can pretty much hump
whatever you want.

01:24:39.074 --> 01:24:40.701
- Cool! Sweet!
- Awesome! Yes!

01:24:40.701 --> 01:24:45.539
Rule number three is the most
important rule, bar none:

01:24:45.539 --> 01:24:47.666
You are not alone.

01:24:48.542 --> 01:24:50.627
You know,
I used to think my place

01:24:50.627 --> 01:24:52.879
was by Doug's side,
but now I know

01:24:52.879 --> 01:24:55.090
my place is
wherever I want it to be,

01:24:55.090 --> 01:24:58.343
and I've never felt
more at home.

01:24:58.343 --> 01:25:00.512
'Cause I know a guy
who lets me crash

01:25:00.512 --> 01:25:02.681
whenever I want.

01:25:02.681 --> 01:25:04.641
- Hey, loser.
- Hey, fuckface.

01:25:07.936 --> 01:25:10.105
Liam, the cute scruffy dog
is back!

01:25:16.778 --> 01:25:19.531
- Isn't this the life?

01:25:20.532 --> 01:25:22.451
Who's a good boy?

01:25:22.451 --> 01:25:24.036
You're a good boy.

01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:26.955
Such a good boy.

01:25:26.955 --> 01:25:29.166
I've learned a lot since Doug.

01:25:29.166 --> 01:25:31.001
Sure, there are some bad people
in this world,

01:25:31.001 --> 01:25:34.838
but even Bug would agree--
the good ones are out there.

01:25:34.838 --> 01:25:37.007
You just got to keep
your eyes open.

01:25:37.007 --> 01:25:38.550
Hey, kids.

01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:40.052
I'll rip your fucking lungs
out through your mouth!

01:25:40.052 --> 01:25:41.678
- Fuck you, mailman! Fuck you!
- Son of a bitch!

01:25:41.678 --> 01:25:43.430
Oh, these guys have
a lot of energy, don't they?

01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:45.140
I'm-a eat your fucking nut
sack... -You're a bad person!

01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:46.558
Get out of here, you evil,
evil little shit! -Aw.

01:25:46.558 --> 01:25:47.934
I'll give you
to the count of three,

01:25:47.934 --> 01:25:49.728
and then I'm gonna jump
this fence

01:25:49.728 --> 01:25:51.605
- and skull-fuck you to death!
- You stupid fucking evil devil!

01:25:51.605 --> 01:25:53.357
You're just as bad as your
friend in the sky! -One, two...

01:25:53.357 --> 01:25:55.275
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. You smart.
- You fuckwad, go! Go!

01:25:55.275 --> 01:25:56.568
- You smart.
- Go! Keep moving!

01:25:56.568 --> 01:25:58.320
Smart move. Keep walking.

01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:00.155
Don't even think about
coming back here tomorrow.

01:26:00.155 --> 01:26:01.490
- Fuck off!
Yeah, bitch.

01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:03.075
You don't want to get
this guy angry.

01:26:03.075 --> 01:26:05.660
I may be small,
but you have no idea

01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:07.913
what I'm capable of.

01:26:07.913 --> 01:26:10.165
Just ask Doug!

01:26:10.165 --> 01:26:12.834
