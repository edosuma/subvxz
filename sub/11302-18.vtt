WEBVTT

00:05.799 --> 00:07.442
- [Colt] Found it.
- [indistinct chatter on TV]

00:07.466 --> 00:08.802
Hey, dude. Check it out.

00:08.885 --> 00:11.680
They got Tanya Showers reading
off the lottery numbers now.

00:11.763 --> 00:15.391
Man, first the weather,
now reading the numbers.

00:15.474 --> 00:17.185
There anything she can't do?

00:18.770 --> 00:20.372
[Rooster] I still remember
that time they sent her out

00:20.396 --> 00:22.523
- to cover the Aspen Jazz Festival.
- [Colt chuckles]

00:22.607 --> 00:25.359
It's weird having a boner
watching Willie Nelson on TV.

00:27.862 --> 00:29.862
Hey, you think she'd go
on a date with me and Abby?

00:31.282 --> 00:33.618
What if they hit it off,
Abby left you for her?

00:34.285 --> 00:36.162
I think I'd be fine with that.

00:37.664 --> 00:40.625
I need to talk to you boys for
a second. Turn that thing off.

00:40.709 --> 00:42.126
[chuckling] Oh.

00:43.712 --> 00:46.214
They got Tanya doing the lotto.

00:46.840 --> 00:49.676
Anyone watching is already a winner.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.553
Well, we should enjoy her while we can.

00:52.637 --> 00:55.473
She's off for bigger things. I
can feel it. Probably New York.

00:55.557 --> 01:00.103
Yeah, wouldn't be surprised if Al
Roker goes back to stress eatin'.

01:01.312 --> 01:03.898
Anyway, I wanna talk to you guys.

01:03.982 --> 01:05.483
What, can it wait a minute?

01:05.567 --> 01:08.447
There's a guy at Boulder who found a
rock that looks like Dwayne Johnson.

01:11.239 --> 01:13.199
It's a rock that looks like The Rock.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.494
In Boulder, which is also a rock.

01:17.746 --> 01:19.205
This is important.

01:19.288 --> 01:21.540
Yeah, but, Dad, this is like that time

01:21.625 --> 01:25.211
Dog the Bounty Hunter got bit by
a pit bull in Chihuahua, Mexico.

01:27.505 --> 01:30.634
It was a dog gettin' bit by a dog
in a town named after a dog. So...

01:34.888 --> 01:36.931
- All right.
- [TV turns off]

01:38.057 --> 01:40.257
- [Rooster exhales heavily]
- I owe you boys an apology.

01:41.269 --> 01:43.146
I know I've been tough on you.

01:44.480 --> 01:48.109
And I know I could've handled the
breeding situation a little different.

01:50.236 --> 01:53.990
You saying you're... wrong
for taking it away from us?

01:54.073 --> 01:56.409
I said I was sorry, not wrong.

01:56.492 --> 01:58.536
Yeah, right.

01:58.620 --> 02:00.371
Look, I know I can be...

02:01.289 --> 02:04.375
tough to deal with sometimes.
Short-tempered and...

02:04.458 --> 02:07.586
- Listen, Dad...
- Shut the fuck up and let me finish.

02:10.089 --> 02:13.009
I know you haven't always felt
like you're part of this ranch.

02:13.927 --> 02:14.928
But you are.

02:16.054 --> 02:18.347
And I appreciate all your hard work.

02:19.223 --> 02:23.645
And I'm gonna do a better job of showing
you how much you boys mean to me.

02:27.398 --> 02:28.607
Well, thanks, Dad.

02:30.068 --> 02:31.402
[Colt grunts softly]

02:32.862 --> 02:34.488
You mean a lot to us, too, Dad.

02:41.705 --> 02:44.207
This is why I don't say nice things.

02:47.836 --> 02:49.838

[indistinct chatter]

03:52.108 --> 03:53.985
[Abby] Yeah... [chuckles]
[Colt] Hey, hey.

03:54.903 --> 03:56.112
- Hey.
- Mmm?

03:56.195 --> 03:59.323
You know, uh, who
Tanya Showers is, right?

03:59.407 --> 04:00.491
Oh, the weather girl?

04:00.574 --> 04:02.160
- Yeah.
- [Abby chuckles]

04:03.077 --> 04:04.162
Would you ever consider...

04:04.245 --> 04:05.454
Definitely.

04:09.083 --> 04:10.126
- Really?
- Hmm.

04:10.209 --> 04:12.420
It'd be like, you, me and Tanya...

04:12.503 --> 04:14.223
Oh, wait, you're gonna
be there? No, thanks.

04:15.799 --> 04:16.925
[chuckles] Hey.

04:17.007 --> 04:19.128
Would you have a threesome
with me and Channing Tatum?

04:19.177 --> 04:21.470
Oh, you're gonna be there? No, thanks.

04:23.932 --> 04:26.725
You two just gonna sit at
the bar and drink all day?

04:26.810 --> 04:29.288
Well, we were gonna go home and
throw in a Channing Tatum movie

04:29.312 --> 04:30.814
and see what happens.

04:30.897 --> 04:32.648
[Abby laughing]

04:32.731 --> 04:34.818
Actually, no, uh...

04:34.901 --> 04:36.069
[chuckles]

04:37.111 --> 04:38.446
I should probably get goin'.

04:38.529 --> 04:41.950
I gotta get ready for, uh,
parent-teacher conferences this week.

04:42.033 --> 04:45.036
Gotta think of something nice
to say about 34 different kids.

04:45.119 --> 04:47.789
"Aidan is very social."
Which is code for,

04:47.872 --> 04:50.208
"Aidan is really annoying
and won't shut the fuck up."

04:50.291 --> 04:51.417
[chuckling]

04:52.585 --> 04:55.088
They always used to say
I was advanced for my age.

04:55.171 --> 04:59.258
Oh, that was code for, "You
got held back two years."

05:01.552 --> 05:04.472
All right, that explains the growth
spurt between fifth grade and...

05:05.473 --> 05:06.515
fifth grade.

05:06.599 --> 05:08.351
[chuckles] Bye, Mrs. Bennett.

05:08.434 --> 05:09.768
Bye, Abby.

05:09.853 --> 05:11.270
All right, we'll see you, Mom.

05:11.354 --> 05:13.439
Yeah. Drive safely.

05:13.522 --> 05:15.817
Of course, you've been driving
since the seventh grade.

05:17.819 --> 05:19.946
Well, I should be leaving, too.

05:20.029 --> 05:21.239
Oh, take care, Hank.

05:21.322 --> 05:23.199
I said "should be."

05:26.119 --> 05:27.245
Here you go.

05:28.913 --> 05:30.081
Hey, Mom. What's up, Hank?

05:30.164 --> 05:31.165
- Hey.
- Rooster.

05:31.249 --> 05:32.351
You just missed your brother.

05:32.375 --> 05:33.877
Oh, no, I saw him.

05:34.961 --> 05:37.005
Threw a snowball at
him. Hit Abby instead.

05:38.214 --> 05:39.942
Told her I'd give her a
kiss to make it feel better,

05:39.966 --> 05:41.717
at which point Colt
threw a snowball at me.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.261
Hit Abby instead. [Chuckles]

05:43.344 --> 05:45.346
- [Hank chuckles]
- Can I get a whiskey?

05:46.597 --> 05:47.974
How are you doin'?

05:48.057 --> 05:50.518
How'd your conversation
with Ed go last night?

05:51.895 --> 05:54.397
I mean, it went fine, you
know. He offered me a job.

05:54.480 --> 05:57.525
Oh, honey, I'm so proud of
you. You're making a smart move.

05:57.608 --> 05:58.651
I'm not gonna take it.

05:58.734 --> 06:00.028
You're a fucking idiot.

06:02.906 --> 06:05.324
Yeah, Mary says I should take it, too.

06:05.992 --> 06:07.743
I mean, it has been
a rough stretch, but...

06:07.826 --> 06:09.930
You know, I had a really good
conversation with Dad last night.

06:09.954 --> 06:11.872
He actually apologized for everything.

06:11.956 --> 06:15.251
Told us how much he relies on
us and he wants things to change.

06:15.334 --> 06:18.212
[scoffs] Your father? Change?

06:18.296 --> 06:21.132
He still flies a flag
with 48 stars on it.

06:22.758 --> 06:25.844
Yeah, and if Colt asks, that's
how many it's supposed to be.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.640
Look, I think your father
really believes what he says,

06:29.723 --> 06:32.768
but eventually he just goes
back to the way he's always been.

06:32.851 --> 06:35.729
Remember that Christmas we bought
him that John Wayne DVD collection

06:35.813 --> 06:39.733
and he just used it as bookends
for his John Wayne VHS collection?

06:39.817 --> 06:42.421
[chuckles] Yeah, it's like that
year we got him his first computer.

06:42.445 --> 06:43.925
He left it in the box for six months,

06:43.988 --> 06:46.199
and then used it as a
desk for his typewriter.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.988
I think you should at least
consider the job with Ed,

06:50.036 --> 06:53.998
not dismiss it because of some
vague promises your father made.

06:55.208 --> 06:56.928
All right. Yeah, I
guess I can check it out.

06:56.960 --> 06:59.378
Yeah. I mean, what would it hurt?

06:59.462 --> 07:02.090
It's important to get all
the facts before you decide.

07:03.341 --> 07:05.801
Right... so, you're saying
consider all the options

07:05.884 --> 07:07.678
before making a thoughtful decision.

07:08.721 --> 07:11.182
Well, first time for everything.

07:13.142 --> 07:15.311
You know, if you choose to do this,

07:15.394 --> 07:17.855
your father's not gonna take it well.

07:17.939 --> 07:21.109
So all I ask is that you let
me be there when you tell him.

07:31.035 --> 07:32.453
Holy shit!

07:33.371 --> 07:35.789
You are not making my decision easy.

07:35.873 --> 07:37.434
It's what I pictured
heaven lookin' like.

07:37.458 --> 07:38.459
[Ed chuckles]

07:38.542 --> 07:41.712
Except you were naked, and
you were Carrie Underwood.

07:42.964 --> 07:44.840
[stutters] And this
would be your office.

07:45.967 --> 07:47.218
Holy shit!

07:47.301 --> 07:48.802
Do I get my own hot assistant?

07:49.553 --> 07:50.596
No.

07:50.679 --> 07:54.225
[chuckles] You obviously have no
idea how low my bar is for "hot."

07:56.269 --> 07:59.647
Wow, so, you got these screens
to monitor the entire herd?

07:59.730 --> 08:00.773
Yep.

08:00.856 --> 08:02.984
And you got this ATV to get around...

08:03.651 --> 08:05.903
and your own personal
bathroom around the corner.

08:05.987 --> 08:09.782
Damn. Back on the ranch, my own
personal bathroom <i>is</i> the corner.

08:11.034 --> 08:13.036
And here comes one of your ranch hands.

08:13.119 --> 08:14.495
Uh, hey, Umberto.

08:14.578 --> 08:15.997
Hey.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.416
Get the fuck outta here! Berto!

08:18.499 --> 08:19.625
<i>Gallo!</i>

08:19.708 --> 08:21.919
- [both laughing]
- What's up, man?

08:22.003 --> 08:23.546
I see you two guys know each other.

08:23.629 --> 08:24.713
Oh, hell, yeah!

08:24.797 --> 08:27.258
Berto worked on the ranch for
like ten years after Colt left.

08:27.341 --> 08:28.777
Dude, I thought you went back to Mexico.

08:28.801 --> 08:30.761
- I did. Two weeks in Cancún.
- [chuckles]

08:30.844 --> 08:33.847
Body shots at Señor Frogs. I
was on MTV's <i>Spring Break.</i>

08:33.931 --> 08:35.015
Whoa!

08:35.099 --> 08:37.643
Then I went to work for Neumann's
Hill on a ranch in Montana.

08:37.726 --> 08:39.562
They pay much more than Mr. Beau.

08:40.729 --> 08:43.441
- Please do not tell Mr. Beau.
- [chuckles]

08:43.524 --> 08:46.319
We just brought Umberto
down here about a week ago.

08:47.403 --> 08:50.174
You've been in town an entire week, we
haven't gone out and gotten drunk yet?

08:50.198 --> 08:51.907
- What the hell you been doing?
- Working.

08:51.990 --> 08:54.118
[chuckling] Lame.

08:54.202 --> 08:57.246
I mean, me too. I've been working,
too, 'cause I'm responsible.

08:57.330 --> 08:58.414
[Ed] Mmm.

08:58.497 --> 09:01.334
Rooster here might be joining
our family as your foreman.

09:01.417 --> 09:02.561
You want me to show him around?

09:02.585 --> 09:04.962
Great. Just keep him
away from the sheep.

09:05.046 --> 09:06.130
[Rooster chuckles]

09:06.214 --> 09:09.383
All right. Good one, Ed. I'll
call you later, man. [Chuckles]

09:09.467 --> 09:10.509
We don't have sheep.

09:10.593 --> 09:12.553
No, he's saying I like to bang sheep.

09:12.636 --> 09:15.848
Oh, okay, then you should take
them between cameras three and four.

09:15.931 --> 09:17.391
There's a blind spot.

09:19.435 --> 09:20.478
What?

09:21.270 --> 09:22.521
What?

09:23.481 --> 09:25.691
[scoffs] I don't fuck sheep.

09:25.774 --> 09:27.985
<i>Gallo, Gallo...</i>

09:28.069 --> 09:29.528
no one's judging.

09:32.365 --> 09:34.634
All right, man. Well, so far,
I've only heard Ed's bullshit.

09:34.658 --> 09:36.160
Is it really as badass as it seems,

09:36.244 --> 09:38.662
working over here at
My Little Pony Ranch?

09:38.746 --> 09:40.289
It's incredible.

09:40.373 --> 09:43.000
We have the best equipment,
good hours, good pay.

09:43.084 --> 09:44.418
Yeah, so you mentioned.

09:44.502 --> 09:47.671
And sometimes, uh, the owner's
wife gets in the hot tub...

09:49.006 --> 09:50.424
- topless.
- Oh!

09:50.508 --> 09:52.718
At first, you are
embarrassed and you look away,

09:52.801 --> 09:54.720
but then, she says,

09:54.803 --> 09:56.523
[imitating woman] "It's
okay, you can look."

09:57.973 --> 09:59.600
[in normal voice] So you look.

10:02.520 --> 10:04.272
There's no part of that I don't like.

10:04.980 --> 10:06.899
So, wanna take a look at the place?

10:06.982 --> 10:08.776
Yeah, man. Let's head out.

10:08.859 --> 10:10.486
Show me the pasture and the bull barn.

10:10.569 --> 10:13.489
But first, we should
stop by that hot tub.

10:13.572 --> 10:16.700
- Hey, then I'll show you the blind spot.
- [chuckles]

10:24.958 --> 10:27.878
Hey, Colt. Look who
the Democrats let in.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.338
[chuckles]

10:29.422 --> 10:31.299
- Oh, man, Berto!
- Hey...

10:31.382 --> 10:33.217
Hey, what're you doing here?

10:33.301 --> 10:35.028
Oh, man. He's working at
the old McConnell ranch.

10:35.052 --> 10:37.596
Seriously? Whoa, that's great.

10:37.680 --> 10:40.974
Colt, good to see you. You know,
I followed your football career.

10:41.058 --> 10:43.852
Yeah, yeah, I had a hell of a run.

10:43.936 --> 10:46.063
Yeah... it made me very sad.

10:47.105 --> 10:48.816
Yeah.

10:48.899 --> 10:50.651
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:50.734 --> 10:51.860
Yeah.

10:54.572 --> 10:56.365
Hey, you remember Abby? Right?

10:56.449 --> 10:58.075
- Hey, Berto.
- Hey, Abby.

10:58.159 --> 11:00.578
Yeah, <i>Gallo</i> told me
you were dating Colt now,

11:00.661 --> 11:02.221
but you were secretly in love with him.

11:03.372 --> 11:05.040
Yeah, well, Rooster also thinks

11:05.123 --> 11:08.043
he's responsible for Blake Shelton
and Miranda Lambert breakin' up.

11:10.796 --> 11:12.465
- Hold on to her...
- [Abby chuckles]

11:12.548 --> 11:13.858
Better than you did the football.

11:13.882 --> 11:16.134
[chuckles] That's very funny.

11:16.219 --> 11:17.678
Oh, it's funny because you...

11:17.761 --> 11:20.806
you fumbled and were
intercepted, oh, so many times.

11:21.390 --> 11:22.391
Yeah, I got it.

11:22.475 --> 11:24.203
Yeah, sometimes you even
fell down on the field

11:24.227 --> 11:26.019
when no one was even near you.

11:26.103 --> 11:28.689
[chuckling] Man, it's
good to have you back.

11:28.772 --> 11:31.650
Oh, my God, look who's here.

11:31.734 --> 11:33.319
Oh, Mrs. Beau. <i>Hola.</i>

11:33.402 --> 11:34.612
[chuckles]

11:34.695 --> 11:36.895
It's good to see you. Nobody
has called me that in ages.

11:36.947 --> 11:38.491
I did not miss it.

11:39.617 --> 11:41.619
Sorry, I won't do it again, Mrs. Beau.

11:41.702 --> 11:43.662
Can I get you something, Umberto?

11:43.746 --> 11:44.830
Sure, I would like a sip

11:44.913 --> 11:46.933
from that fountain of youth
you've been drinking from.

11:46.957 --> 11:48.251
- Oh, stop it!
- [Abby chuckles]

11:48.334 --> 11:50.669
Yeah. Stop it.

11:52.838 --> 11:54.423
[all laughing]

11:54.507 --> 11:57.067
Oh, my God. Man, we used to do
the craziest shit back in the day.

11:57.092 --> 11:58.844
Yeah, hey. You remember
"Tractor Skiing"?

11:58.927 --> 12:00.554
[chuckling] What's that?

12:00.638 --> 12:02.824
It's when you pull somebody in
a pair of skis behind a tractor.

12:02.848 --> 12:04.158
I should have done the math on that.

12:04.182 --> 12:05.351
[chuckles]

12:05.434 --> 12:08.312
Yeah, it got real crazy when we
elevated it to "Truck Skiing."

12:08.396 --> 12:09.480
[both chuckle]

12:09.563 --> 12:11.399
- "Truck Skiing" is when...
- No, I got it.

12:12.107 --> 12:13.710
Hey, man, remember the
look on that cop's face

12:13.734 --> 12:15.254
when you blew past
him on a pair of skis?

12:15.278 --> 12:16.279
[all laughing]

12:16.362 --> 12:19.823
You know, when I hear you guys talk
about all the great times you had...

12:19.907 --> 12:22.576
all I can think is,
"Guys are fucking idiots."

12:22.660 --> 12:24.346
- [Colt chuckles] Hell, yeah.
- Yeah, we are.

12:24.370 --> 12:25.538
[Abby chuckles]

12:25.621 --> 12:27.516
Oh, you know what? Colt, we
should probably get going.

12:27.540 --> 12:28.642
- It's a school night.
- Yeah, yeah.

12:28.666 --> 12:30.584
Oh, you're still in school?

12:30.668 --> 12:32.169
Him, I believe, but...

12:32.252 --> 12:34.087
[chuckles] No, I'm a teacher now.

12:34.171 --> 12:37.257
Oh, the... the young boys
must be, uh, very pleased.

12:37.341 --> 12:39.009
[chuckles] Yeah, check it out, man.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.553
She even teaches sex ed.

12:40.636 --> 12:43.806
Oh. Do you put a condom on a banana?

12:43.889 --> 12:47.810
Okay, that's... All right, maybe,
no more beer for you, huh? [Chuckles]

12:47.893 --> 12:49.728
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

12:49.812 --> 12:52.398
I only say these things because
I am intoxicated. [Chuckles]

12:52.481 --> 12:53.774
[Colt and Rooster chuckle]

12:53.857 --> 12:55.233
Intoxicated by your beauty.

12:56.735 --> 12:57.820
Stop.

12:57.903 --> 12:58.987
Don't stop.

13:00.448 --> 13:02.616
Hey. Don't you have a
girlfriend of your own?

13:02.700 --> 13:05.035
- [Abby chuckles]
- There was a woman.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.662
Selena.

13:06.745 --> 13:08.080
Her eyes were green...

13:08.997 --> 13:10.416
but her card was not.

13:11.542 --> 13:13.544
Oh. Okay, sweetie, it's time to go home.

13:13.627 --> 13:15.546
Yeah, same thing INS said to Selena.

13:16.589 --> 13:17.840
We'll get to see you again?

13:17.923 --> 13:20.884
Yes. And if <i>Gallo</i> takes
the job at Neumann's Hill,

13:20.968 --> 13:22.886
then we'll see a lot of each other.

13:23.762 --> 13:25.055
Neumann's Hill?

13:26.014 --> 13:27.516
What's he talking about?

13:27.600 --> 13:30.811
[chuckles] No, man. It's not
a big deal. It's just, uh...

13:30.894 --> 13:33.647
Ed Bishop offered me a job
running the old McConnell ranch.

13:35.190 --> 13:37.443
Oh... all right.

13:37.526 --> 13:40.278
So that's where you ran into Berto, huh?

13:40.363 --> 13:42.155
- Yeah.
- What...

13:42.239 --> 13:43.532
When did all this happen?

13:43.616 --> 13:45.075
Oh, it was a couple of days ago.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.838
You know, I was gonna
talk to you about it.

13:47.285 --> 13:48.328
Yeah.

13:48.412 --> 13:49.913
[Abby clears throat]

13:49.997 --> 13:51.582
[clicks tongue] Good for you, man.

13:51.665 --> 13:53.459
- [chuckles] Hey, Colt...
- All right?

13:53.542 --> 13:54.752
Yeah, okay. Bye, guys.

13:54.835 --> 13:55.919
Hey, man. Hang on a second.

14:01.133 --> 14:02.342
[sighs]

14:05.345 --> 14:06.639
[sighs]

14:11.309 --> 14:12.603
It was good to see him.

14:21.529 --> 14:22.696
[door closes]

14:25.866 --> 14:28.243
- Hey.
- Thought you'd be sleeping.

14:28.326 --> 14:29.412
No, I stayed up.

14:29.495 --> 14:31.789
Tanya filled in on the
eleven o'clock news.

14:32.706 --> 14:35.501
She did a piece about...
Christmas at the mall.

14:36.419 --> 14:37.836
She sat on Santa's lap.

14:37.920 --> 14:41.048
Now, I don't know what she asked for
but I know Santa got what he wanted.

14:45.594 --> 14:47.137
Look, I wanna talk about that job.

14:48.138 --> 14:49.306
[scoffs]

14:49.390 --> 14:52.017
Oh, now you wanna talk about it?

14:53.143 --> 14:54.788
I mean, I didn't bring it up
earlier 'cause, you know...

14:54.812 --> 14:55.938
Yeah, you know what?

14:56.021 --> 14:59.357
This is, like, a... major life decision.

15:00.984 --> 15:04.237
I talk to you before I decide
to change brands of shampoo.

15:05.531 --> 15:07.408
Yeah, and it's really fucking annoying.

15:09.284 --> 15:12.621
Almost as annoying as when you ask
me how your ass looks in them jeans.

15:14.873 --> 15:16.553
Okay, first of all,
I'd never ask you that,

15:16.584 --> 15:18.335
'cause I already know it looks good.

15:21.046 --> 15:22.255
And second of all,

15:22.339 --> 15:26.844
I can't even believe that you're
thinkin' about leavin' our ranch.

15:28.471 --> 15:29.763
"Our ranch"?

15:31.223 --> 15:33.016
Where'd you get the
idea this is our ranch?

15:33.100 --> 15:34.477
I mean, that's the plan, right?

15:34.560 --> 15:37.038
Dad's gonna step aside and you and
me, we're gonna run it together.

15:37.062 --> 15:39.815
Dude, Dad wouldn't step
aside for a charging bull.

15:41.108 --> 15:43.276
He'd just stare at it, touch
his mustache and be like,

15:43.360 --> 15:44.612
"You really wanna do this?"

15:46.947 --> 15:48.156
Someday...

15:49.658 --> 15:50.909
Dad's gonna die.

15:50.993 --> 15:52.327
No, I don't think he is.

15:53.829 --> 15:56.164
He's like a cockroach or Keith Richards.

15:56.248 --> 15:58.834
Well, fuck. Forget
about Dad. What about me?

16:00.377 --> 16:03.130
You fucking kidding me?
This isn't about you.

16:03.797 --> 16:06.383
Really? 'Cause I'm the one
who's gonna be stuck here

16:06.467 --> 16:08.886
with Dad all pissed off
with the double workload.

16:08.969 --> 16:11.722
You just described the
last 15 years of my life.

16:11.805 --> 16:13.724
Well, guess what, man? You left.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.452
Mom left. Why shouldn't
I get a shot to leave?

16:15.476 --> 16:17.520
No, no, no, no, no. I
left for a football career!

16:17.603 --> 16:18.937
You're going down the road

16:19.021 --> 16:21.649
to do the same goddamn
job at another ranch!

16:21.732 --> 16:23.612
No, I'm leaving for a
career, just like you did.

16:23.692 --> 16:25.492
Except I'll actually
make something of myself.

16:29.031 --> 16:30.240
[stammering]

16:30.323 --> 16:32.618
Fuck you. You take this stupid job.

16:33.536 --> 16:34.787
Come on, man.

16:40.042 --> 16:41.209
[sighs]

16:43.045 --> 16:44.087
[door slams]

16:53.597 --> 16:55.891
[Beau] Why are you working on
the tractor in the driveway?

16:55.974 --> 16:58.936
[Rooster grunts] 'Cause
that's where it broke, Dad.

16:59.895 --> 17:01.730
Well, let me rephrase.

17:01.814 --> 17:04.066
Why'd you break the
tractor in the driveway?

17:06.609 --> 17:09.571
[sighing] Well... I was gonna do
it in the barn, then I thought,

17:09.655 --> 17:10.823
"Hey, you know what?

17:10.906 --> 17:13.701
Outside, it's like ten degrees
with six inches of fresh snow.

17:13.784 --> 17:15.035
I should do it out there."

17:15.117 --> 17:17.412
Oh, and as a bonus, I
can't find my gloves.

17:17.494 --> 17:18.955
So, zippidy-fucking-doo-dah!

17:22.084 --> 17:23.417
Did you let it warm up?

17:23.501 --> 17:24.580
Of course I let it warm up.

17:24.627 --> 17:26.003
Checked the pump?

17:26.088 --> 17:27.631
Yep, pump is fine.

17:27.714 --> 17:28.882
Checked the lines?

17:28.966 --> 17:30.551
That's what I'm doing right now, Dad.

17:31.802 --> 17:33.386
[Rooster grunts]

17:33.470 --> 17:35.764
- Loosen that top clamp first.
- God, you know what?

17:35.848 --> 17:37.182
Here, you do it.

17:38.100 --> 17:41.019
All right, I take the
point. Go on. Keep going.

17:41.103 --> 17:43.521
No, no. Go ahead. I'm just
gonna fuck it up anyway, right?

17:45.023 --> 17:47.067
I'm just saying I think I
know what the problem is.

17:47.150 --> 17:48.485
Oh, yeah? Well, what is it?

17:49.027 --> 17:50.988
Lemme get in there a
sec and take a look.

17:51.071 --> 17:52.280
Be my guest.

17:54.366 --> 17:55.618
[Rooster sighs]

17:55.701 --> 17:56.744
[sniffs]

17:58.411 --> 18:01.691
Make sure you put a little liquid wrench
on there, otherwise you're gonna strip it.

18:05.168 --> 18:08.088
It's not as much fun being
on the ass end of that, is it?

18:13.093 --> 18:14.552
Hand me that Channellock.

18:21.018 --> 18:22.019
You know what, Dad?

18:23.561 --> 18:25.731
I get the feeling sometimes,
if I weren't here...

18:25.814 --> 18:27.174
you probably wouldn't even notice.

18:30.819 --> 18:32.404
Of course I would.

18:32.487 --> 18:34.865
There'd be a beer in the
fridge when I wanted one.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.201
Exactly.

18:46.835 --> 18:48.420
Hey, Colt. How're you doin'?

18:49.838 --> 18:52.590
- Pretty shitty.
- Oh, would you like a beer?

18:54.384 --> 18:56.594
You know what? I don't
even think I wanna drink.

18:57.387 --> 18:58.889
None of us do,

18:58.972 --> 19:00.641
but we soldier on.

19:02.184 --> 19:03.310
[sighs]

19:03.393 --> 19:04.602
All right, what's going on?

19:04.687 --> 19:06.855
All right, you can't tell anyone.

19:08.691 --> 19:10.108
Rooster got a job offer.

19:10.192 --> 19:12.569
Yeah, Neumann's Hill. I know.

19:12.653 --> 19:14.404
I set him up with Ed.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.406
I told him he should take it.

19:18.826 --> 19:19.993
Why would you do that?

19:20.577 --> 19:22.913
He's my son. I want him to be happy.

19:24.665 --> 19:27.793
I'm your son. Don't
you want me to be happy?

19:28.376 --> 19:30.170
Why do you think I offered you the beer?

19:32.380 --> 19:34.299
Come on, I want you both to be happy.

19:34.382 --> 19:36.009
Well, we can't both be happy.

19:36.093 --> 19:37.761
One of us has to stay with Dad.

19:39.722 --> 19:41.514
Colt, I help you whenever I can.

19:41.598 --> 19:43.600
This is my chance to help Rooster.

19:43.684 --> 19:47.229
It's a really big opportunity
for him, and he deserves it.

19:47.312 --> 19:48.480
What about me?

19:48.563 --> 19:50.315
Wow. [Scoffs]

19:50.398 --> 19:52.998
I tell you this is something that
could change your brother's life

19:53.026 --> 19:55.362
and your response is, "What about me?"

19:56.029 --> 19:59.032
Come on, you need to support
him the way he supported you

19:59.116 --> 20:00.356
when you were playing football.

20:00.408 --> 20:01.534
Wha... Are you kidding me?

20:01.618 --> 20:04.121
He wrote a letter to the
Denver Broncos, saying,

20:04.204 --> 20:07.750
"Please don't draft my brother 'cause
I don't want my favorite team to suck."

20:09.710 --> 20:12.838
Well, come on, Colt, it's the Broncos.

20:14.172 --> 20:15.841
Besides, he... he didn't send it.

20:15.924 --> 20:17.801
He just did that to mess with you.

20:17.885 --> 20:20.846
If he didn't send it, then
why didn't I make the Broncos?

20:20.929 --> 20:24.141
Okay, I'm your mother. Don't
make me answer that question.

20:26.727 --> 20:28.937
Do you remember when
the Barcelona Dragons

20:29.021 --> 20:32.900
asked you for that last-minute tryout,
but you had to pay for your own ticket?

20:36.486 --> 20:37.570
Yep.

20:38.530 --> 20:39.782
I was bummed out...

20:40.949 --> 20:42.450
'cause I didn't think I could go.

20:43.535 --> 20:45.746
And Barcelona is like
the Paris of Europe.

20:46.830 --> 20:50.417
Hmm. There's those two years
of fifth grade kickin' in.

20:53.211 --> 20:54.712
I don't get it, but whatever.

20:57.549 --> 20:59.927
And then you wired me
the money and I went.

21:00.010 --> 21:01.053
No.

21:01.136 --> 21:03.305
I couldn't afford a
bus ticket to Telluride,

21:03.388 --> 21:05.140
let alone a plane ticket to Spain.

21:05.223 --> 21:08.560
I had just sunk every
penny I had into this bar.

21:08.643 --> 21:10.728
I know the feeling.

21:17.110 --> 21:18.570
What are you saying? It was Rooster?

21:19.404 --> 21:20.488
Yep.

21:21.073 --> 21:24.534
He had been saving for a couple of
years to buy himself a new truck, but...

21:25.410 --> 21:27.955
[sighs] he believed in you.

21:28.038 --> 21:31.708
And he didn't want your career to end
because you couldn't get to a tryout.

21:37.214 --> 21:39.424
But, why... why didn't he just tell me?

21:40.300 --> 21:43.386
'Cause he was afraid if you knew what
he gave up that you wouldn't take it.

21:44.221 --> 21:46.556
He might ride your ass, but deep down,

21:46.639 --> 21:49.309
he's your older brother and
he's always looking out for you.

21:53.856 --> 21:54.982
Shit.

21:58.235 --> 21:59.319
[stammers] Hold on.

21:59.402 --> 22:02.614
It... After I made that team, I
paid you back for that plane ticket.

22:03.406 --> 22:06.326
How do you think I got
season tickets to the Broncos?

22:11.581 --> 22:13.291
God, man, I am so sick of this.

22:14.334 --> 22:16.586
I mean, my dad doesn't even
trust me to wipe my own ass.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.881
Nah, that is not right.

22:18.964 --> 22:21.591
My grandmother, she had a saying...

22:21.674 --> 22:24.427
"A man should wipe his own ass."

22:25.845 --> 22:27.615
Man, I almost told him
right there in the driveway,

22:27.639 --> 22:29.679
"I'm leavin'. I'm goin' to
work for Neumann's Hill."

22:30.350 --> 22:31.393
What stopped you?

22:31.476 --> 22:34.437
[sighs] I don't know. I don't know
if I can do it to Colt, you know.

22:34.521 --> 22:36.314
Plus, my dad was holdin' a giant wrench.

22:36.940 --> 22:37.983
So...

22:38.066 --> 22:39.734
So, Colt is not taking the news well?

22:39.817 --> 22:41.319
No.

22:41.403 --> 22:43.405
I don't know what the
hell to do. You know?

22:43.488 --> 22:46.408
I can stay and be miserable, or I
can leave and make Colt miserable.

22:46.491 --> 22:47.534
And Mr. Beau?

22:47.617 --> 22:49.327
He's gonna be miserable either way.

22:51.246 --> 22:54.374
You know, <i>Gallo,</i> when I
left Mexico, my family was furious.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.751
My mother cried for two weeks and my...

22:56.834 --> 22:59.587
my father said he had no son.

22:59.671 --> 23:01.924
Which I'm sure felt even
worse for my brother.

23:04.676 --> 23:05.718
But I had to go.

23:07.304 --> 23:08.430
Glad you left?

23:08.972 --> 23:10.557
Well, it was painful.

23:10.640 --> 23:11.975
It was horrible...

23:12.892 --> 23:14.519
and I was lonely.

23:14.602 --> 23:15.687
But, yes.

23:15.770 --> 23:18.398
I knew there was a better life here.

23:18.481 --> 23:21.359
Just like this ranch offers
a better life for you.

23:23.486 --> 23:25.072
And your journey to get here

23:25.155 --> 23:28.158
didn't involve you hiding in a
truck full of giant <i>piñatas.</i>

23:29.284 --> 23:31.036
The only thing I had
to eat for three days

23:31.119 --> 23:34.122
were these Jolly Ranchers that
came out of SpongeBob's <i>culo.</i>

23:37.584 --> 23:38.894
So, what happened with your family?

23:38.918 --> 23:40.420
Well, they came around.

23:41.421 --> 23:44.132
They were proud of me
for how well I was doing.

23:46.426 --> 23:50.055
So, you think if I do a good job here...
[sighs] eventually, my dad'll come around?

23:50.138 --> 23:51.223
Mr. Beau?

23:51.306 --> 23:52.474
Fuck, no.

23:55.143 --> 23:57.645
But your brother? He'll come around.

23:57.729 --> 23:58.855
What makes you think that?

23:58.938 --> 24:01.316
Oh, 'cause he's on camera
three. He's comin' in right now.

24:03.360 --> 24:04.486
[Colt] Oh, shit.

24:06.571 --> 24:07.864
This is nice.

24:08.823 --> 24:12.869
Hey... did you guys know there's
a naked lady out there in a hot tub?

24:15.288 --> 24:16.664
I tried not to stare.

24:18.291 --> 24:21.128
Oh, you will try. And you will fail.

24:22.462 --> 24:23.755
And you will stare.

24:27.175 --> 24:28.218
What ya doin' here?

24:30.345 --> 24:31.471
Peace offering.

24:33.515 --> 24:36.101
- There's only five.
- It was a long drive.

24:38.686 --> 24:40.813
Yeah? Well, how'd you know I was here?

24:42.190 --> 24:44.817
Oh, uh... I probably say wrong word.

24:44.901 --> 24:46.319
My English not very <i>bueno.</i>

24:48.905 --> 24:49.989
Give us a second?

24:50.615 --> 24:51.616
Sure.

24:52.575 --> 24:54.327
Thank you.

24:54.411 --> 24:56.621
If you need me, I'm
gonna walk by the hot tub,

24:56.705 --> 24:59.833
then I'm gonna be in the blind
spot between cameras three and four.

25:02.835 --> 25:03.920
[sighs] Look...

25:04.003 --> 25:06.173
whatever you came to say,
I don't wanna hear it.

25:06.256 --> 25:07.757
You gotta take this job.

25:09.676 --> 25:10.677
What?

25:11.886 --> 25:13.180
[softly] Come on, man.

25:13.971 --> 25:16.058
Look at this place.
This guy went all out.

25:16.974 --> 25:20.853
The new ATVs, all new tools...

25:21.771 --> 25:24.566
Plus, see, I don't even know what
this thing is, but I want one.

25:24.649 --> 25:26.193
[chuckles]

25:26.276 --> 25:28.486
That's his daughter's princess wand.

25:28.570 --> 25:29.821
Oh.

25:31.156 --> 25:32.449
Still want one.

25:35.660 --> 25:36.661
Look...

25:37.787 --> 25:39.206
I had my shot.

25:40.540 --> 25:41.583
This is yours.

25:44.502 --> 25:45.712
I owe you.

25:47.004 --> 25:51.551
Oh, by the way, Mom owes you $1,200
for a plane ticket to Barcelona.

25:54.429 --> 25:56.031
I don't know what the
hell you're talking about.

25:56.055 --> 25:57.056
[Colt] Yeah.

25:58.225 --> 25:59.434
Look...

26:00.810 --> 26:04.063
if you don't take this job,
I'm gonna kick your ass.

26:05.523 --> 26:07.900
That's real cute, you
think you can kick my ass.

26:14.824 --> 26:17.202
Oh, my God. Berto...

26:18.536 --> 26:20.497
Damn, does he think
he's in a blind spot?

26:22.249 --> 26:23.291
Oh!

26:32.049 --> 26:33.635
- [door opens]
- [Rooster shivers]

26:39.391 --> 26:40.517
Hey, Dad. What ya doin'?

26:41.851 --> 26:43.311
Just sittin' by the fire...

26:44.396 --> 26:47.649
watching six inches of
global warming come down.

26:52.362 --> 26:54.197
[sighs] Look...

26:56.449 --> 26:58.951
I wanted to apologize
about this morning.

26:59.035 --> 27:01.163
I was just... just frustrated.

27:03.623 --> 27:07.084
Been meaning to talk to you about
something, but I wasn't sure how, so...

27:09.296 --> 27:11.130
I'm not helping you bury a body...

27:13.550 --> 27:14.759
or raise a kid.

27:17.220 --> 27:19.639
And we're not getting a fuckin' cat.

27:22.767 --> 27:24.727
- You got a minute?
- Sure.

27:28.606 --> 27:29.982
[Rooster sighs]

27:31.818 --> 27:33.486
[clicks tongue] Look...

27:35.697 --> 27:39.116
I owe... everything to you.

27:39.951 --> 27:44.080
Everything I know about ranching...
is because of you, and...

27:45.707 --> 27:47.459
there's no way I can ever repay that.

27:49.168 --> 27:50.753
That all sounds correct.

27:55.217 --> 27:57.927
I wanted to tell you that
I got offered a job...

27:59.053 --> 28:01.889
from Ed Bishop at Neumann's Hill,

28:01.973 --> 28:03.433
to run the old McConnell ranch.

28:09.188 --> 28:11.148
And I know you don't
think I'm ready for it...

28:12.191 --> 28:13.651
but I know that I am.

28:15.152 --> 28:16.779
And that's because of you.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.534
And I'm gonna take that job.

28:39.469 --> 28:40.512
[door closes]

29:03.034 --> 29:05.036
