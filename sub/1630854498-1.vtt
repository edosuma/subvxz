03:35.560 --> 03:36.880

07:29.160 --> 07:31.240
You weren't answering the phone.

07:32.280 --> 07:35.600
Nico needed a place to crash.
Wanted to help him out.

07:35.680 --> 07:37.360
I gave him your keys. It was dumb.

07:37.960 --> 07:39.760
Never thought he'd do something like this.

07:39.840 --> 07:41.800
Wouldn't have lent him your keys.
You know me.

07:41.880 --> 07:43.520
He needed cash, he was desperate.

07:44.440 --> 07:47.160
Well, we know he sold them.
Do you know where? Any ideas?

07:47.240 --> 07:50.000
-Stove's still there, at least.
-Think I give a shit?

07:50.080 --> 07:51.240
What about my records!

07:51.320 --> 07:53.640
All my records, man!
Took me years to find them!

07:53.720 --> 07:56.160
You think about that?
Wanna be a DJ and got no records!

07:56.240 --> 07:57.960
So, what do I do? What do I do?

07:59.720 --> 08:02.000
He wouldn't be able
to dump them just anywhere!

08:05.200 --> 08:08.400

-Champ-Disque.

08:08.920 --> 08:11.440

08:19.400 --> 08:20.560
Come back to Germain's.

08:21.120 --> 08:22.960

You were the best courrier.

08:23.040 --> 08:25.520
Does he still have the same crew
with everybody using?

08:26.480 --> 08:28.280
I don't want that. I'm clean.

08:28.360 --> 08:29.400
You're clean?

08:29.480 --> 08:30.440
Like clean, clean?

08:31.040 --> 08:32.080

08:34.400 --> 08:36.680
A TV producer is looking for a funk band.

08:36.760 --> 08:39.120
-TV gigs are good money.
-I'm gonna pay you back.

08:39.200 --> 08:40.160
TV gigs are garbage!

08:40.240 --> 08:42.480
I'm finished with corporates
and playing base.

08:42.560 --> 08:44.360
It's all about spinning records now.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.320
The future is turntables., DJs.

08:46.400 --> 08:49.600
They can do anything,
they're like inventors. It's amazing.

08:49.680 --> 08:51.920
The energy gets into your blood,
it's like the best high ever!

08:52.000 --> 08:55.160
Wait. You're freaking me out.
Haven't joined a cult or anything, right?

08:55.240 --> 08:57.920
-Or some weird dirty hippy--
-Talking about music. Real music.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.480
So, what do we do for cash?

09:11.080 --> 09:12.360
No way…

09:12.440 --> 09:15.040
LSD? Genius.

09:15.120 --> 09:17.640
-It's from San Francisco?
-Yeah.

09:17.720 --> 09:20.320
What's it going for these days?
How much can I make?

09:20.920 --> 09:24.000
I don't know. But I'll find out for you.

09:24.080 --> 09:27.320
<i>17% of the vote.</i>
<i>Which is a new high for France.</i>

09:27.400 --> 09:29.880
<i>Jean-Marie Le Pen,</i>
<i>the president of the National Front,</i>

09:29.960 --> 09:31.520
<i>held a press conference this…</i>

09:31.600 --> 09:34.480
<i>And again, as you'll see,</i>
<i>the tone was as severe…</i>

09:35.000 --> 09:37.840
<i>I said it before,</i>
<i>we're well-equipped hospitals…</i>

09:38.360 --> 09:41.160
Don't you think you look a bit like him?

09:41.240 --> 09:44.000
Me? Thought you were talking about Dad.

09:44.080 --> 09:45.080
Yeah, hilarious.

09:45.160 --> 09:48.520
But in ten years, when he's president,
see if you're still laughing.

09:48.600 --> 09:52.600
<i>Just look at the six million immigrants</i>
<i>who've settled in France</i>

09:52.680 --> 09:56.840

09:58.000 --> 09:59.480
Hey, you're finally home!

10:00.480 --> 10:02.120
I opened eight new accounts.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.160
-Tada!
-Whoa! Look at that!

10:08.240 --> 10:10.280

10:10.360 --> 10:12.640
-Sweetheart, bravo.
-Office drinks next month.

10:12.720 --> 10:15.120

No, Mr. Lopes, huh? Mrs. Lopes.

10:15.880 --> 10:17.000

10:17.920 --> 10:21.160
-Oh, we got nothing but good news today.
-Oh, yeah?

10:23.800 --> 10:24.840
Come on, tell her.

10:24.920 --> 10:26.280
What happened?

10:27.680 --> 10:29.440
Mommy's old baby got scouted.

10:29.520 --> 10:31.840
-What!
-Don't touch my hair! Already warned you!

10:31.920 --> 10:33.640
-Whoa!
-Get off me!

10:33.720 --> 10:36.160
-Takes me all day to get it just right.
-Stop it.

10:36.240 --> 10:38.480
A guy from Lens came around
to check out the team today.

10:38.560 --> 10:41.400
-And they want him.
-That's wonderful! Super!

10:41.480 --> 10:43.280
A Lopes at Bollaert.

10:43.360 --> 10:45.560
That'll drive that bastard Le Pen crazy.

10:45.640 --> 10:48.680
-Can we eat now? I'm starving?
-Alright. Let's eat.

10:52.520 --> 10:54.120
You made lasagna?

11:00.480 --> 11:02.000
No, not in there.

11:05.240 --> 11:06.440
I think he's down here.

11:07.120 --> 11:08.120
You sure?

11:11.040 --> 11:12.840
Come on, let's get outta here.

11:16.240 --> 11:17.600
Fuck!

11:19.880 --> 11:23.440
-See, I wasn't lying.
-Is that Pierre?

11:23.520 --> 11:24.800
Fuck, that's really him.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.160
Do you think we should do something?

11:29.880 --> 11:31.120
What do you wanna do?

11:32.560 --> 11:33.800
He's looking pretty pale.

11:40.280 --> 11:42.120
[man] Hey, what're you doing?

11:49.040 --> 11:51.240
Gonna move him, you keep your mouth shut.

11:51.320 --> 11:53.400
Otherwise, the cops will be all over us.

11:53.480 --> 11:54.680
What happened to him?

11:54.760 --> 11:56.240
Isn't it fucking obvious?

11:56.840 --> 11:59.880
He shot up and he dropped dead! Got it?

12:00.400 --> 12:01.520
Hey, Chérif?

12:01.600 --> 12:02.840
That's it, we got it.

12:03.360 --> 12:04.360
We should go.

12:05.840 --> 12:06.920
Fucking go!

12:09.640 --> 12:11.200
Go on, get out!

13:08.000 --> 13:11.720
-I'd like to buy these also.
-OK. That's a helluva dinner.

13:14.920 --> 13:15.960
Twenty-three fifty.

13:34.760 --> 13:35.680

Can I?

13:44.880 --> 13:48.800
"Tears are like the warm rain,
our souls like the thirsty earth."

13:48.880 --> 13:51.840

to keep the world in harmony."

13:54.880 --> 13:55.880
[man calls her]

13:58.800 --> 14:00.080
In the office.

14:05.280 --> 14:06.880
Do you smoke?

14:06.960 --> 14:08.600
Smoke. A smoke, huh? OK.

14:09.240 --> 14:10.320
Meet you out there.

14:11.760 --> 14:13.600
Thanks. Have a good day.

14:16.400 --> 14:18.000
What music do you play?

14:18.600 --> 14:20.680
Funk, soul…

14:20.760 --> 14:23.280
-But right now, I'm more into hip-hop.
-Hmm.

14:23.800 --> 14:26.480
-Is it good, hip-hop?
-You've never heard it?

14:26.560 --> 14:30.000
It's amazing. Really mind-blowing.
Won't believe it when you hear it.

14:30.080 --> 14:33.040
-Was just in the States, it's everywhere.
-You were in the US?

14:34.160 --> 14:36.080
San Francisco. You know?

14:36.160 --> 14:39.640
Yeah, well. I've seen it on television.
same as everyone else.

14:41.520 --> 14:42.480
Why're you back here?

14:43.480 --> 14:46.960
Because in America,
hip-hop, uh, it's cool,

14:47.040 --> 14:50.680
but, I don't know, I sorta feel,
I feel like we should be doing it here.

14:53.120 --> 14:55.680
-It sounds like you're a messenger.
-Yeah.

15:00.760 --> 15:02.280
Which club are you spinning at?

15:03.000 --> 15:05.760
Well, for now, I'm not at a club.
I'm just on the radio.

15:05.840 --> 15:08.600
-Oh, yeah? Which station?
-Uh, Carbone 14.

15:09.600 --> 15:10.840

15:15.240 --> 15:16.520
I mean, I'm part of…

15:16.600 --> 15:18.840
It's just that I'm still waiting for…

15:18.920 --> 15:20.720
I've got a time slot,

15:20.800 --> 15:23.600

16:22.160 --> 16:23.280
Hey, come with me.

16:27.080 --> 16:28.680
So, do they fit?

16:29.400 --> 16:32.120
Do your heads fit up your asses?

16:32.200 --> 16:34.080
Lopes, you going to Lens, or what?

16:34.160 --> 16:36.080
-Why do you care?
-Whoa.

16:36.160 --> 16:38.760
Shit the bed because you've no skills?
Man's got no skills.

16:38.840 --> 16:41.560
Shouldn't be talking about skills.
We've all seen you with a ball.

16:41.640 --> 16:44.080
Guys like you
wish they could keep up with me.

16:44.160 --> 16:47.440
I'm a big dreamer, Lopes.
Want to see you on the big-screen…

16:47.520 --> 16:50.400
Don't worry.
One day, you'll turn it on, see my face.

16:50.480 --> 16:52.720
-Oh yeah?
-Know you don't have a TV right now,

16:52.800 --> 16:54.360
but we'll save and get you one.

16:54.440 --> 16:56.320
That's really sweet.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.160
Good to see
you've still got that big head.

16:58.240 --> 17:01.200
-Hang on, hang on. Seriously? Not cool.
-How come?

17:01.280 --> 17:04.560
When the scouts talked to his father,
what do you think they thought?

17:05.280 --> 17:08.280
Portuguese men are more likely to shrink.

17:08.360 --> 17:10.680
Wait, is it nap time for you, island boy?

17:10.760 --> 17:13.400
Huh? Seems like
you're usually napping around now.

17:13.480 --> 17:16.480
Oh, wait, silly me.
I forgot it's welfare day, right?

17:16.560 --> 17:18.040
Better hurry, they're closing soon.

17:18.120 --> 17:20.200
Haven't you heard? Huh?

17:21.000 --> 17:23.800
You grow more
when you're flat on your back.

17:24.360 --> 17:26.800
All right, ladies,
where are y'all going anyway?

17:26.880 --> 17:28.840
-We're going to Troca.
-Oh, yeah?

17:29.440 --> 17:32.280
-Same as us.
-And you're going in your pajamas.

17:32.360 --> 17:34.000
Really cool.

17:36.800 --> 17:37.720
Chino!

17:40.600 --> 17:43.480
Oh, wow! Got all dressed up.
Where'd you get that?

17:43.560 --> 17:46.320
Hey, man, you really fit in now.

17:46.400 --> 17:47.880
Don't forget where you came from.

17:47.960 --> 17:50.520
Did you walk here?
I've been waiting three hours.

17:50.600 --> 17:52.400
Come on.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.760
You've had your dad to keep you company.

18:00.680 --> 18:01.840
Am I missing something?

18:03.480 --> 18:05.520
Why didn't you tell me
you were going to Lens?

18:07.320 --> 18:09.320
What am I gonna do there?
I'm a Saint-Denis boy.

18:09.400 --> 18:10.880
What's that to do with anything?

18:10.960 --> 18:13.040
This place stinks,
but you wanna stay forever.

18:17.320 --> 18:20.400
-Alright.
-Didier has magic fingers.

18:20.480 --> 18:22.360
Do you need help?

18:22.440 --> 18:24.840
-Do you wanna help?
-Of course, what do you want?

18:26.000 --> 18:29.480
Why don't you get me a sandwich in Spain.

18:30.520 --> 18:32.040
-Go on, I'm starving.
-Huh?

18:43.240 --> 18:44.440
Keep an eye out.

18:46.600 --> 18:49.240
Wow!

19:04.760 --> 19:05.880
Look at that.

19:12.560 --> 19:14.880
[dancer] Come on, come on, come on!

19:14.960 --> 19:16.400
Let's go!

19:17.600 --> 19:18.760
Hey! Hey!

19:19.800 --> 19:21.160
Hey, come on!

19:21.240 --> 19:22.680
Clap your hands, everybody!

19:27.200 --> 19:29.200
Watch the footwork! Watch the footwork!

19:29.280 --> 19:31.560
Ooh! Ooh! Go, go!

19:32.360 --> 19:33.920
Ah! Ah! Ah!

19:38.760 --> 19:40.160
[crowd cheers]

19:40.240 --> 19:43.360
Mince! Shift! Stop! Go for wee!

19:52.520 --> 19:57.320
[hubbub, exclamations]

20:09.440 --> 20:10.560
[dancer] Ooh!

20:14.200 --> 20:16.000
[dancer] Let's go! Yeah!

20:16.080 --> 20:17.280
Ooh!

20:17.360 --> 20:21.080
Ooh! Ooh! Go! Go!
Walk the plank! Walk the plank!

20:21.800 --> 20:23.720
Yeah! Ah! Ah!

20:28.680 --> 20:32.560
Ooh! Ooh! Come on,
clap your hands, everybody!

20:39.160 --> 20:41.000
[dancer] Thank you, all, very much.

21:05.880 --> 21:08.120
This entire box,
you know this is my stuff.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.200
Maybe, but it's none of my business.

21:10.280 --> 21:13.760
JB, don't do this to me.
We know each other, man. Come on.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.800
You know this is my life,
bought most of these records here.

21:16.880 --> 21:18.560
Sure, but a man's gotta eat.

21:18.640 --> 21:20.680
This is for work! I'm not fucking around!

21:20.760 --> 21:23.600
Got an interview for a radio gig.
I'm risking everything!

21:26.160 --> 21:27.640
OK. I guess…

21:27.720 --> 21:32.200
if you're willing to buy the whole box,
I can give you a little discount.

21:33.720 --> 21:36.000
For your customers.
You interested?

21:36.080 --> 21:37.840
-What's that?
-LSD.

21:37.920 --> 21:40.520
No. Are you crazy?
Want me to go out of business?

21:40.600 --> 21:43.200
-200 francs worth, for half the price.
-No, no, no, no.

21:44.160 --> 21:46.520
Well, in that case…

21:46.600 --> 21:49.320
I could take a couple off your hands
just for me.

21:52.160 --> 21:53.080
Hello, JB.

21:53.160 --> 21:54.840
-Hello Patou.
-Hi. How are you?

21:55.440 --> 21:58.320
-Has the Hancock arrived yet?
-Haven't gotten the new imports yet.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.040
As soon as I get it, I promise…

22:00.120 --> 22:03.120
Heard Future Shock in New York
with Bill Laswell. Was magnificent.

22:03.200 --> 22:06.800
-Oh yeah? Pete Cosey's also on the album.
-He's an incredible guitar player.

22:06.880 --> 22:09.440
-What label do you work for?
-Mmm! I work for EPIC.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.400
Material's new long version EP,
<i>Bustin' Out,</i> do you have that?

22:13.480 --> 22:16.360
Uh, well,
I might still have a sample copy.

22:16.440 --> 22:19.680
-I'll have to go look for it in the back.
-That would be amazing.

22:40.080 --> 22:41.920
Will you tell him I'll be back later?

22:45.680 --> 22:47.040
Here you go.

22:51.160 --> 22:52.880
Said he'll be back later.

22:59.640 --> 23:01.200
Very well. You?

23:03.840 --> 23:04.840
Same as last time…

23:04.920 --> 23:07.480
By the way,
I'm gonna need to write you a note.

23:08.200 --> 23:10.240
Excusing you from class on Monday.

23:10.320 --> 23:12.840
-What's happening Monday?
-Lens.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.160
-The boarding school visit.
-Right. Right.

23:16.240 --> 23:17.800
I took the day off from work.

23:18.400 --> 23:19.240
Hmm?

23:20.880 --> 23:22.840
We're leaving in five minutes. Ready?

23:22.920 --> 23:23.760
-Hmm.
-OK?

23:28.560 --> 23:30.680
-Who you playing today?
-Ivry.

23:30.760 --> 23:32.400
The southern outskirts.

23:32.480 --> 23:34.880
You gonna beat the shit outta them,
right? Huh?

23:34.960 --> 23:37.080
Lionel Richie,
really think I'm gonna lose?

23:40.040 --> 23:41.680
Gilles, can you lend me 20 bucks?

23:41.760 --> 23:43.320
Twenty? For what?

23:43.400 --> 23:45.160
Need a special mat for dancing.

23:45.240 --> 23:47.440
You want me to buy you a ballerina mat?

23:47.520 --> 23:50.240
It's not what you're thinking.
I'll explain later.

23:50.320 --> 23:52.880
-Explain it to me now.
-Will you give it or not?

23:52.960 --> 23:55.280
Yes or no? Just, yes or no. Come on.

23:58.240 --> 24:00.880
OK. But you're gonna clean my room.

24:03.480 --> 24:04.680
OK.

24:05.240 --> 24:06.520
-OK?
-OK.

24:12.880 --> 24:13.960
Thanks.

24:14.040 --> 24:15.280
What?

24:15.360 --> 24:17.640
Gonna clean my room
every week until you leave.

24:17.720 --> 24:20.360
-That's not what we agreed.
-I just changed the deal.

24:25.480 --> 24:26.800
Consider yourself lucky.

24:26.880 --> 24:29.280
Not everyone
gets to clean Lionel Richie's room.

24:29.360 --> 24:31.080
Alright.

24:31.600 --> 24:32.880
Ciao, Dolores.

24:36.360 --> 24:38.040
Thank you very much.

24:38.120 --> 24:40.000
See you tomorrow, Mr. Locatelli. Bye.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.040
Bruno?

24:43.120 --> 24:44.560
-Hmm?
-The grocer from Stains,

24:44.640 --> 24:47.080
didn't you go to junior high
with his son, Maxime?

24:47.680 --> 24:49.680
-Yeah. Maxime Locatelli, sure.
-Yeah?

24:49.760 --> 24:50.960
What's their place like?

24:51.040 --> 24:53.160
I'm not sure about their place.

24:53.240 --> 24:55.640
But Maxime would wear
the same tracksuit to school.

24:55.720 --> 24:57.960
-Uh-huh.
-Every day. All patched up.

24:58.040 --> 25:00.400
-Even though his dad has lots of money.
-Yeah?

25:00.480 --> 25:03.360
-Gonna sell him insurance.
-He's stingy. Won't buy it.

25:03.440 --> 25:05.240
-How much you wanna bet?
-Not betting.

25:05.320 --> 25:08.680
-His father's a tightwad, Mom.
-So what? Saving money is important.

25:11.800 --> 25:13.200
Mr. Locatelli, listen to me.

25:13.280 --> 25:15.520
-No…
-I worked at a factory for years

25:15.600 --> 25:17.200
and my husband, in construction.

25:17.280 --> 25:19.480
We have two boys and we've had hard times.

25:19.560 --> 25:23.440
And even though I got through that,
it's never been at the expense of others.

25:23.520 --> 25:25.600
I'm sure
you're putting aside money every month…

25:25.680 --> 25:27.400
-Don't have time.
-What if you get burgled?

25:27.480 --> 25:29.200
I'm sure you've thought of it.

25:29.280 --> 25:31.560
What I'm offering you is security.

25:31.640 --> 25:33.000
What about punctuality?

25:33.080 --> 25:35.360
You can sleep peacefully,
and while you're dreaming,

25:35.440 --> 25:38.200
-Your savings multiply. There you go.
-Multiply. Hmm-mm.

25:38.280 --> 25:40.280
With a deal like this, Mr. Locatelli…

25:40.360 --> 25:41.840
-I'm late.
-…everyone wins.

25:41.920 --> 25:44.720
-And look at this.
-Seriously, Mom, I'm gonna be late.

25:47.840 --> 25:49.960
This is for you.

25:57.280 --> 25:58.360
Do you like it?

25:58.920 --> 26:00.960
Something cool to wear at Lens.

26:03.520 --> 26:05.000
-Thanks.
-[Christiane] Hmm.

26:05.680 --> 26:08.320
Hey. You'll make a good life for yourself.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.120
You'll be alright.

26:11.200 --> 26:13.120
We're the same, you and I. Hmm?

26:17.120 --> 26:20.840
Peuw… ta! Boom-boomsh…

26:28.240 --> 26:29.440
What're you doing there?

26:37.600 --> 26:40.000
I thought I told you to stay put.
They're coming.

26:46.040 --> 26:46.880
My notebook!

26:57.840 --> 26:59.160
Give me number 12.

27:03.080 --> 27:04.600
Oh, there it is. Here.

27:05.600 --> 27:06.440
No, no, no…

27:06.520 --> 27:09.640
That one's not 12, it's five.
I've explained the code to you.

27:09.720 --> 27:11.200
You need the middle one.

27:16.080 --> 27:18.680
Why don't you leave the covers on?
Wouldn't that be easier?

27:18.760 --> 27:21.440
A master chef
doesn't give his secret ingredients away.

27:21.520 --> 27:23.440
If you don't get that, you won't last.

27:25.040 --> 27:26.160
Number 12.

27:27.080 --> 27:28.760
Keep your fingers off that now.

27:40.560 --> 27:41.400
[chortles]

27:47.360 --> 27:48.480
Fred Aucagos.

27:48.560 --> 27:49.960
He's something else.

27:50.640 --> 27:52.880
He founded Les Vikings de la Guadeloupe.

27:52.960 --> 27:54.680
Was a student in France.

27:54.760 --> 27:57.360
Asked his father to send him money,
supposedly for schoolbooks,

27:57.440 --> 27:59.960
only instead, he bought an amp.

28:00.040 --> 28:02.640
And his father found out,
and he told him, "Hey!"

28:02.720 --> 28:06.080
"Your time in France and Paris,
that's all over. You're coming home."

28:06.160 --> 28:08.840
And thanks to that,
he founded the Vikings.

28:08.920 --> 28:11.280
In his hometown. You get that?

28:11.360 --> 28:14.520
He made the whole mainland
dance to the sound of the West Indies.

28:14.600 --> 28:15.680
A great man.

28:16.600 --> 28:19.440
What do you hear? Huh?
How many styles can you hear?

28:19.960 --> 28:22.000
I can hear zouk, biguine…

28:23.280 --> 28:25.520
compas, cadence, funk, rock.

28:28.200 --> 28:30.560
Yeah, these guys can play everything.

28:30.640 --> 28:32.320
It's more than a style, it's…

28:32.400 --> 28:33.240
it's a blend.

28:34.200 --> 28:36.040
That's why you need to learn
about them all.

28:46.000 --> 28:46.840
[Jean chortles]

28:49.040 --> 28:51.200
The chronicles of an impending disaster.

28:51.280 --> 28:53.520
Three, two, one…

29:03.160 --> 29:05.560
-[moaning intensifies]
-[director unintelligible]

29:10.240 --> 29:11.600
You're a little cutie.

29:11.680 --> 29:14.080
What else can you do with those hands
other than jerk off?

29:14.160 --> 29:17.160
-Technical skills?
-Well, technical stuff isn't a problem.

29:17.240 --> 29:19.600
But thought the job
was to play music, like a DJ.

29:19.680 --> 29:21.720
I just go back from San Francisco.

29:21.800 --> 29:23.880
Brought a bunch of cool stuff with me…

29:23.960 --> 29:26.240
-Uh, so here, this…
-San Francisco?

29:26.320 --> 29:28.200
Lots of sex over there, I bet.

29:28.280 --> 29:31.160
-Well, yeah… Sure.
-Yeah, that's cool.

29:31.240 --> 29:33.320
Give you some time slots,
you'll be our tech guy.

29:33.400 --> 29:38.000
But a couple of things; if you work here,
this whole area is crawling with pigs, OK?

29:38.080 --> 29:39.120
They want us.

29:39.200 --> 29:41.600
Those prudes
took away our broadcasting license,

29:41.680 --> 29:43.880
anytime you come and go
from this building,

29:43.960 --> 29:45.440
make sure you're not followed.

29:46.120 --> 29:47.160
OK.

29:47.240 --> 29:48.320
Also…

29:48.920 --> 29:50.200
It's unpaid.

29:51.560 --> 29:52.800
But paid in kind.

29:55.600 --> 29:57.120
This bank is always open.

30:12.840 --> 30:15.000
[chuckles quietly]

30:15.880 --> 30:17.360
He shouldn't be here!

30:17.440 --> 30:19.520
Neither should you, what's wrong with you!

30:19.600 --> 30:22.040
Why can't you
take some responsibility?

30:22.120 --> 30:23.960
I'll take responsibility,
if you do,

30:24.040 --> 30:26.160
but you're too stupid,
or you wouldn't be here!

30:26.760 --> 30:30.280
So, how do I pay for his lunches?
For his soccer equipment?

30:30.360 --> 30:32.440
Show up for your son for once!

30:32.520 --> 30:35.080
Don't come here
and make problems in front of everyone!

30:35.160 --> 30:36.560
Do you understand me? Go on!

30:41.480 --> 30:42.600
What're you doing?

30:43.640 --> 30:45.320
I told you to stay at the table!

30:46.200 --> 30:47.080
Who was that?

30:47.160 --> 30:49.440
She's not your mother.
Told you, your mother's dead.

30:50.760 --> 30:52.520
That women's a good-for-nothing.

31:28.520 --> 31:29.640
-Hello.
-Hello.

31:32.760 --> 31:34.240
-How are you?
-Good, you?

31:34.320 --> 31:35.200
Come in.

31:37.160 --> 31:39.000
-So, welcome.
-Thank you.

31:45.800 --> 31:47.440
Such an amazing view.

31:47.520 --> 31:50.480
Everything okay with your dad?
Were there any problems?

31:50.560 --> 31:52.480
No. He's probably dead drunk by now.

31:54.040 --> 31:54.880
Your records?

32:01.720 --> 32:03.040
Oh, you've got tons!

32:09.160 --> 32:11.600
Is this good?

32:11.680 --> 32:13.360
Side Effect? It's genius.

32:13.960 --> 32:17.040
Bass line in the first track
will just blow your mind, I swear.

32:19.240 --> 32:20.560
Do you want a drink?

32:20.640 --> 32:25.360
I've got some wine or beer
I've got some tea if you prefer?

32:26.240 --> 32:27.320
Whatever you prefer.

32:41.520 --> 32:44.080
Do you work at the store every day
or have another--

32:45.120 --> 32:46.000
job?

32:47.640 --> 32:48.840
Here.

32:52.840 --> 32:54.840
But let me put on a bit of music though.

32:57.040 --> 32:58.480
Uh, Faze-O, heard of them?

32:59.200 --> 33:01.680
-No.
-They're, uh, they're really good.

33:34.240 --> 33:35.680
What happened there?

33:35.760 --> 33:37.720
Nothing. Don't worry about those.

34:16.200 --> 34:17.040
Hmm.

34:19.080 --> 34:19.920
That's cool.

34:36.560 --> 34:38.880
Oh, wow, not bad! Yeah, not bad.

34:41.640 --> 34:44.520
Shh, shh, shh. Let's see.

34:46.200 --> 34:48.600
Shhh. Shhh.

34:49.680 --> 34:52.200
Shhhh. Shh.

34:59.040 --> 35:00.960
-Look at that.
-Hmm?

35:02.800 --> 35:05.960
-That's Lopes, what's he doing?
-What's he carrying?

35:30.640 --> 35:34.520
-No, let's turn around. Bring it up.
-OK, yeah. Up.

35:38.120 --> 35:40.120
-Yeah, that's cool.
-Hey, "Lopesh".

35:40.760 --> 35:43.560
You in construction now?
Did you quit school?

35:44.560 --> 35:45.600
Getting into it too, huh?

35:46.480 --> 35:47.800
I saw you dancing before.

35:49.920 --> 35:50.760
Cool glove.

35:52.800 --> 35:54.480
You're also pretty well equipped.

35:57.400 --> 36:00.160
-Hey, uh, mind if we join you?
-Sure.

36:01.520 --> 36:02.840
Here you go.

36:02.920 --> 36:05.520
-Make some room for the professionals.
-OK.

36:05.600 --> 36:08.520
Shh! Pu! Ah!

36:09.120 --> 36:10.480
-Bah! Bah!
-Shh!

36:10.560 --> 36:12.120
-Sheoew!
-Hah!

36:12.200 --> 36:13.880
That's it.

36:13.960 --> 36:17.960
Hah! Ooh!
Like the guy from The Troca.

36:18.040 --> 36:21.040
-Check it. Whoop. Hah!
-I'm more into the floor stuff.

36:30.200 --> 36:31.400
Make room in the middle.

36:31.480 --> 36:32.840
Shh, ouh!

36:32.920 --> 36:34.560
Look, look, look. Watch.

36:35.800 --> 36:38.520
Watch my feet. Look at my feet.

36:38.600 --> 36:40.080
Boom! The other way.

36:40.720 --> 36:42.160
Oh, yeah, man!

36:44.680 --> 36:47.240
Let's try to do the robot.

36:49.480 --> 36:50.960
Have a feeling it's about to rain.

36:51.040 --> 36:52.600
You're the weather girl now?

36:53.800 --> 36:56.080
[thunder rumbles]

37:05.680 --> 37:09.800
-We better fold it up. It's not stopping.
-Just wait a few more seconds, it'll stop.

37:09.880 --> 37:11.760
This is never going to stop,
you're a fool.

37:12.320 --> 37:15.080
Ah, come on. Not spending a night here.
I'm gonna leave.

37:15.160 --> 37:17.680
Come on. Hey, where you going?

37:18.560 --> 37:19.680
Fuck…

37:23.080 --> 37:26.280
Boys, I'm throwing in the towel.
Bruno, I'll see you tonight?

37:32.760 --> 37:34.360
You need to sound panicky.

37:34.440 --> 37:36.640
Then say the head chef
locked you in the meat freezer

37:36.720 --> 37:38.000
'cause you ruined a mayonnaise.

37:38.080 --> 37:40.400
But isn't your friend
already on his way here?

37:40.480 --> 37:42.680
I could just play some music
in the meantime.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.600
No, I don't like music. It bores me.

37:44.680 --> 37:46.600
Just do as I say, a panicky voice.

37:50.120 --> 37:53.880
OK, wait. I-it's just, it makes no sense.
If I'm locked in a… a meat freezer,

37:53.960 --> 37:56.720
-How can I be making calls?
-You ask too many questions.

37:56.800 --> 37:59.600
It's a voyage into the imagination
we're offering listeners here.

37:59.680 --> 38:03.160
And if you get on board,
they'll be ready to follow you anywhere.

38:04.200 --> 38:06.440
Your voice gets weaker and weaker.

38:06.520 --> 38:09.320
You're starting to freeze
and you're desperate to warm up.

38:09.400 --> 38:11.760
And what do you spot? A gigantic tuna!

38:11.840 --> 38:12.960
And you crawl into it.

38:13.480 --> 38:16.400
It's like a sleeping bag.

38:17.120 --> 38:18.160
And then…

38:20.160 --> 38:21.320
…you die.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.800
You'll see, it's gonna be great!

38:29.600 --> 38:32.120
-You sure it's OK that I'm here?
-Yeah, don't worry.

38:32.200 --> 38:33.800
He's never home before six.

38:37.480 --> 38:38.360
Is that your room?

38:38.440 --> 38:40.200
No! That's my father's room.

38:40.280 --> 38:41.320
Don't go in.

38:41.920 --> 38:42.960
My room's here.

38:46.320 --> 38:48.400
Shit… All right.

39:06.680 --> 39:09.120
Don't touch that!
My dad will notice right away.

39:10.120 --> 39:11.040
Shit.

39:12.160 --> 39:15.400
OK… Find us a station.

39:18.080 --> 39:19.520
I'll make us some room.

39:28.760 --> 39:31.560
-Are we doing this or what?
-There's nothing good.

39:40.640 --> 39:44.080
[Biroute in dramatized voice]
Hello, my little kitties. Ooh! [chuckles]

39:44.160 --> 39:45.960
This is your host Biroute.

39:46.040 --> 39:47.840
Right before today's show started,

39:47.920 --> 39:51.560
I received a strange telephone call
from one of our very own listeners.

39:51.640 --> 39:52.960
A wild, wild tale.

39:53.680 --> 39:55.920
I'll give you a special treat,
let him tell you.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.320
he's here with us, live.

39:57.400 --> 39:59.640
Hello, Cédric, are you there?

39:59.720 --> 40:03.160
Cédric, can you hear me?
Alright, tell us what happened to you.

40:03.240 --> 40:04.640
Hello, Cédric?

40:05.600 --> 40:06.640
Hello?

40:07.200 --> 40:09.560
You're a bit too far away.
I can't hear you…

40:09.640 --> 40:10.680
Hey, everyone.

40:10.760 --> 40:12.920
Carbone 14 is on fire.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.720
DJ Dee Nasty speaking to you tonight.
The funk is taking over the airwaves.

40:16.800 --> 40:19.560
The Renegades of Funk
has pirated the pirates.

40:20.400 --> 40:23.560
We're gonna start with a tune
from the other side of the world.

40:23.640 --> 40:26.960
Specially dedicated
to Béatrice, uh, from Belleville.

40:27.040 --> 40:29.400
This is "Goin' Bananas" by Side Effect.

40:29.480 --> 40:32.440
Alright, here we go.

40:32.520 --> 40:34.920
Open up this door! Open up this…

40:35.720 --> 40:38.160
Open up the door. Come on!

40:43.640 --> 40:46.160
["Goin' Bananas" by Side Effect
on the radio radio]

40:49.680 --> 40:51.240
It's perfect!

40:53.280 --> 40:54.880
Turn it down, turn it down.

41:00.840 --> 41:01.720
OK.

41:02.240 --> 41:04.560
-Are you tired?
-You're the tired one.

41:04.640 --> 41:07.120
Yeah, I can tell.

41:07.200 --> 41:09.200
Peeu! Sheoew!

41:16.600 --> 41:19.920
Isn't funny anymore.
Could you please open up?

41:20.000 --> 41:23.760
OK. Turn it off. Could you come in here
and get in there and stop…

41:23.840 --> 41:26.240
He-hey!

41:27.240 --> 41:30.080
Hey! Not bad! Not bad, not bad, not bad.

41:30.160 --> 41:33.800
Go on, That's it! You got it!
That's it. Yes! Get it, get it, get it!

41:33.880 --> 41:36.320
Yeah! Keep going! Keep going!

41:36.400 --> 41:37.400
Again, again, again!

41:37.480 --> 41:39.360
Go on, one, two, three!

41:45.440 --> 41:47.040
Open it up! Open the door!

41:47.120 --> 41:48.520
Oh, put that record down!

41:48.600 --> 41:50.440
Oh, won't you put that down! No!

41:50.520 --> 41:52.920
Don't you play that record!

41:53.000 --> 41:55.360
You little prick!

41:55.440 --> 41:58.560
You gigantic fucking asshole!

41:58.640 --> 42:01.280
Open this fucking door!

42:05.280 --> 42:07.280
'Scuse me? We've had a complaint.

42:07.360 --> 42:09.560
Oh shit, the pigs! Quick, run!

42:12.040 --> 42:14.600
-What're you doing?
-You told me to spin you around.

42:14.680 --> 42:16.520
-Why you spinning like a dork?
-That's what you said.

42:16.600 --> 42:19.280
You're spinning me around like a trunk.
Do it this way.

42:19.360 --> 42:20.960
One, two, three!

42:22.360 --> 42:24.160
-Gonna smack you.
-You told me to swing!

42:24.240 --> 42:26.000
You too stupid to figure it out?

42:26.080 --> 42:28.040
I told you to swing, then you did this…

42:28.120 --> 42:30.040
-You swing this way.
-Go on, show me.

42:30.120 --> 42:32.840
…with one phone call.
You have no right to be in here.

42:33.600 --> 42:36.000
Whoa!

42:37.080 --> 42:39.080
["Renegades of Funk" continues]

42:56.040 --> 42:57.120
One…

42:59.560 --> 43:01.280
Don't touch these! Don't touch them!

43:01.360 --> 43:02.400
…and go!

43:05.840 --> 43:07.240
Oh fuck, the vase!

43:08.360 --> 43:11.000
Fuck, the vase! Fuck!

43:13.000 --> 43:15.560
He's gonna kick the shit outta me. Shit.

43:15.640 --> 43:17.040
Oh, man, is it expensive?

43:18.880 --> 43:22.520
It's from China. Wasn't even allowed
to look at the stupid thing.

43:28.680 --> 43:29.840
When's your dad back?

43:29.920 --> 43:31.800
I told you! He's getting in at six.

43:31.880 --> 43:35.280
That shit is pointless, just stop.
Fuck, I'm dead.

43:35.360 --> 43:37.200
This is bad, I'm really screwed.

43:39.200 --> 43:40.480
Do you have any glue?

43:43.160 --> 43:44.400
Wait, are you serious?

43:47.760 --> 43:49.920
Put the big parts here
and the small there.

44:02.080 --> 44:04.480
Are you almost done? Shit.

44:07.520 --> 44:09.040
We've really gotta move.

44:15.880 --> 44:17.360
That's good, that works.

44:19.360 --> 44:20.200
Shit.

44:25.920 --> 44:26.880
Where does this go?

44:29.480 --> 44:30.440
Oh, shit!

44:30.520 --> 44:32.800
Don't touch! What's this? Where's it from?

44:33.440 --> 44:36.080
-It's here. It's back here. Back here…
-Back where?

44:36.160 --> 44:37.360
-Here. See?
-Oh, yeah.

44:38.120 --> 44:39.680
Shit. Give it, give it here.

44:44.720 --> 44:47.000
Here. Listen, we have to start over.

44:47.080 --> 44:49.560
-Don't have time!
-Won't take long, have to start over.

44:49.640 --> 44:50.880
Give it here!

44:51.480 --> 44:53.880
-Don't have time!
-Let me scratch the glue off.

44:56.320 --> 44:57.320
You're a good dude.

44:58.480 --> 45:00.600
Alright.

45:01.960 --> 45:03.960
Shh!

45:04.040 --> 45:04.880
It's him!

45:04.960 --> 45:07.200
He's here, he's here!
Hurry up! Hurry, hurry!

45:07.280 --> 45:10.120
-What?
-Jump out the window. The window!

45:10.200 --> 45:12.360
Out the window. Hurry up! Go on, go on.

45:12.440 --> 45:13.280
Take this.

45:30.840 --> 45:34.320
-[Joseph] Ah, shit. Geez, let's go!
-Come on!

45:36.760 --> 45:37.600
No!

45:38.200 --> 45:40.200
Not gonna get it in, are they?

45:40.280 --> 45:42.800
-For God's sake, stop him! Dammit!
-No!

45:42.880 --> 45:43.960
What the fuck is that!

45:44.040 --> 45:46.080
-No!
-What's this shit!

45:46.160 --> 45:48.160
Come on Peyroche, stop them!
New strategy!

45:48.240 --> 45:50.120
Your 4-3-3 is worth nothing!

45:50.200 --> 45:53.480
The France Cup final, for God's sake!
Why I told you to practice.

45:53.560 --> 45:55.480
See the whole picture, understand?

45:55.560 --> 45:58.240
-Don't pull moves like that at Lens--
-I'm not going.

45:58.320 --> 46:00.120
What? What you say?

46:00.200 --> 46:01.280
I'm not going to Lens.

46:01.880 --> 46:04.720
-Of course you are.
-I'm not going.

46:05.240 --> 46:08.280
It's the other side of France,
don't know anybody. I'll go next year.

46:11.240 --> 46:12.840
Wait, what is this? OK, what?

46:12.920 --> 46:15.120
-I'm not feeling it.
-You kidding me or what?

46:15.200 --> 46:17.960
Think they'll keep a spot for you
all nice and cozy there?

46:18.040 --> 46:19.320
I decided not to go.

46:19.960 --> 46:23.520
What the fuck are you doing?Oh!

46:26.120 --> 46:26.960
Alright.

46:32.200 --> 46:34.200
-[Joseph] Fuck's sake!
-[Christiane] Hey!

46:34.720 --> 46:37.600
Been driving that ungrateful asshole
to practice for ten years!

46:37.680 --> 46:39.680
Ten years of boredom! No nights off!

46:39.760 --> 46:41.240
Seriously, what the hell!

46:41.320 --> 46:44.480
Three times a week I bust my ass,
I get stuck in fucking traffic

46:44.560 --> 46:47.160
and I freeze my ass off
instead of lying on my couch!

46:47.240 --> 46:49.160
-For what?
-Stop rambling!

46:49.240 --> 46:51.920
Wanna know
what's wrong with him? He's scared.

46:52.000 --> 46:55.400
He's freaking out, shitting himself.
You don't understand a fucking thing!

46:55.480 --> 46:58.400
-It's his life.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah…
