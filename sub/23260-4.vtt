00:02.219 --> 00:03.307
- Previously
on "Falling Water"...

00:07.572 --> 00:09.748
- If I can verify
what I saw last night,

00:09.792 --> 00:12.360
I promise it will be
the end of her career.

00:12.403 --> 00:14.188
- No.

00:15.972 --> 00:18.496
- Are you gonna tell dad it's
another surprise pregnancy?

00:18.540 --> 00:19.932
- Sabine. She's been arrested.

00:19.976 --> 00:21.760
It appears she murdered
Taka's mother.

00:21.804 --> 00:23.806
- He keeps saying,
"They just want to talk."

00:23.849 --> 00:25.329
I'll give you one guess
who I think it is.

00:25.373 --> 00:27.201
both: Bill Boerg.
- Boerg divested himself

00:27.244 --> 00:30.247
of all his businesses,
holdings, and just disappeared.

00:30.291 --> 00:32.336
- Help me, and I will
help you find your son.

00:32.380 --> 00:35.557
- Stop looking for Shadowman.
- I know where he is.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.124
You won't be able to find him
without me.

00:37.167 --> 00:40.040
He's very angry
and wants to hurt people.

00:40.083 --> 00:41.258
Lots of people.

00:41.302 --> 00:43.347
- That's why you brought
your mother home.

00:43.391 --> 00:44.914
She knew how to find Shadowman.

00:44.957 --> 00:46.655
But then he tortured Sabine
in her sleep

00:46.698 --> 00:48.570
until she killed Kumiko.

00:48.613 --> 00:50.789
What if your mom
was getting too close?

00:50.833 --> 00:53.140
He's seen all of us now,
including James.

00:53.183 --> 00:55.577
Let's find this bastard.

01:12.811 --> 01:14.465
- Hey.

01:16.250 --> 01:17.555
- Hi.

01:17.599 --> 01:19.427
You're home?

01:19.470 --> 01:21.298
- Yeah.

01:21.342 --> 01:23.344
Crazy, right?

01:23.387 --> 01:26.999
- Yeah.

01:27.043 --> 01:30.264
- Well, are you going
to let me in?

01:30.307 --> 01:32.875
- Yeah, sure.

01:34.442 --> 01:35.660
I don't understand.
I thought--

01:35.704 --> 01:37.575
- Oh, it was all a mistake.

01:37.619 --> 01:39.229
A misunderstanding.

01:39.273 --> 01:41.840
- But I saw it happening.

01:41.884 --> 01:44.452
You killed my mother.

01:44.495 --> 01:46.193
She's dead.

01:46.236 --> 01:48.804
- Nonsense.

01:50.849 --> 01:52.460
I'm fine.

01:52.503 --> 01:54.157
Come on, now.

01:54.201 --> 01:55.941
Dinner's almost ready.

01:59.293 --> 02:02.339
He was such a finicky eater
when he was young.

02:02.383 --> 02:04.515
- Mom.
- Come on, Taka.

02:04.559 --> 02:05.864
It's a sweet story.

02:05.908 --> 02:07.170
- Sabine doesn't want
to hear it.

02:07.214 --> 02:08.606
- I do.

02:08.650 --> 02:10.565
- I think Taka was
about six or seven.

02:10.608 --> 02:15.178
All I could get him to eat was
cream cheese and Ritz crackers.

02:15.222 --> 02:16.788
Really?

02:16.832 --> 02:19.530
- Afraid so.
- Now look at him.

02:19.574 --> 02:22.185
My boy's a regular gourmand.

02:22.229 --> 02:25.536
No doubt thanks
to your influence.

02:25.580 --> 02:27.234
- No.

02:27.277 --> 02:29.410
He inspires me.

02:29.453 --> 02:30.846
You do, you know.

02:30.889 --> 02:32.674
- Well, let's say it's mutual.

02:35.720 --> 02:42.988
♪

02:48.255 --> 02:49.256
Mom?

02:50.735 --> 02:54.565
♪

02:54.609 --> 02:56.698
Sabine.

02:58.700 --> 03:01.398
Sabine.

03:01.442 --> 03:04.184
No!

03:33.256 --> 03:35.127
Taka, did you see James?

03:35.171 --> 03:37.042
- Uh, no.

03:44.659 --> 03:47.183
James?

03:47.227 --> 03:49.925
Oh, sorry, I thought maybe
James was in here.

03:49.968 --> 03:51.796
- No, he's downstairs
with Ronnie.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.842
They're helping Clinton and
Grace get set up for the day.

03:53.885 --> 03:56.192
Thought you could use
a little extra sleep.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.412
- Yeah, thanks.

03:58.455 --> 04:01.023
I should go check on James.
- I'm sure he's fine.

04:01.066 --> 04:03.765
Look, I would trust Clinton
and Grace with my life.

04:03.808 --> 04:05.767
- Oh, I'm sure, it's--
it's just that I...

04:05.810 --> 04:07.769
- Tess, I know
it's not my place,

04:07.812 --> 04:09.901
but don't you think
James could use some friends

04:09.945 --> 04:12.034
of his own age
to interact with?

04:12.077 --> 04:13.122
Like Ronnie?

04:13.165 --> 04:14.950
- Of course, it's just that...

04:14.993 --> 04:18.127
I like to know
what his dreams were.

04:18.170 --> 04:19.433
I'm scared.

04:19.476 --> 04:22.653
And I-I don't know what to do.

04:22.697 --> 04:24.699
- Look, we'll figure this
all out together.

04:24.742 --> 04:26.657
We will.

04:26.701 --> 04:28.964
Oh, uh, I have something
for you.

04:29.007 --> 04:30.922
Now, I know you didn't have
time to pack

04:30.966 --> 04:33.403
before you left Maine,
so I picked up a few things

04:33.447 --> 04:36.188
for you at the store.

04:36.232 --> 04:37.407
- Thank you.

04:37.451 --> 04:40.454
- You're quite welcome.

04:40.497 --> 04:42.325
It's gonna be okay.

04:46.416 --> 04:47.896
Excuse me.

04:57.862 --> 04:59.168
Good stuff, Dimitri.

04:59.211 --> 05:02.302
If you find anything else,
call me.

05:04.129 --> 05:06.175
Someone's been busy.
- Can't sleep.

05:06.218 --> 05:07.611
- Impressive.

05:07.655 --> 05:09.352
- This guy's
a major league dreamer.

05:09.396 --> 05:12.703
I believe he's connected
to people on your list.

05:12.747 --> 05:14.357
I don't know how,
but I can feel it.

05:14.401 --> 05:16.359
Social Security numbers?

05:16.403 --> 05:17.839
- Yeah, that's what I thought
at first.

05:17.882 --> 05:19.231
They're actually
bank routing numbers.

05:19.275 --> 05:20.755
- Makes more sense.
- And I looked into

05:20.798 --> 05:22.365
their bank accounts
and all of them

05:22.409 --> 05:24.193
were receiving payments
from the shell corporation

05:24.236 --> 05:27.239
registered in the Bahamas,
Sycorax Industries, Limited.

05:27.283 --> 05:29.677
- Any relation to the firm
of Hull

05:29.720 --> 05:31.243
- Can't tell, I mean,
whoever it is

05:31.287 --> 05:33.028
covered their tracks
pretty well.

05:33.071 --> 05:35.291
- It all leads back
to this bastard?

05:36.945 --> 05:40.557
- I know it's a long shot, but
maybe one of them is Shadowman.

05:42.167 --> 05:44.735
- A few of the names
on the list also got checks

05:44.779 --> 05:46.520
from this company
called "drom," supposedly

05:46.563 --> 05:48.217
a medical research company.

05:48.260 --> 05:50.785
Privately held, down near
the financial district.

05:50.828 --> 05:52.352
I tried calling, but no answer.

05:52.395 --> 05:54.484
- Perhaps we should pay them
a little visit.

05:54.528 --> 05:57.182
- Drom.

05:57.226 --> 05:59.054
- I have no idea who that is.

05:59.097 --> 06:00.882
- Possible lead Taka
was able to

06:00.925 --> 06:02.927
dig out of this mound
of data.

06:02.971 --> 06:05.887
- Oh, wow.
- Chalk it up to insomnia.

06:07.758 --> 06:09.281
- Somehow connected
to Hull-Bedford

06:09.325 --> 06:11.893
and their brokering
of Dreamers.

06:11.936 --> 06:13.416
- That was Alex.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.070
She found the RV that was
parked outside my apartment.

06:15.113 --> 06:16.593
- Brooklyn.

06:16.637 --> 06:18.813
I'll call you later.
- I'll check out drom then.

06:23.165 --> 06:24.949
- You're right.
He's in good hands.

06:24.993 --> 06:27.952
And honestly, I'm going insane
doing nothing.

06:36.613 --> 06:38.136
- Hi, I'm Woody.

06:38.180 --> 06:40.225
Woody Hammond. I'm a friend
of Mayor Harding's.

06:40.269 --> 06:42.010
- Yes, of course, Mr. Hammond.

06:42.053 --> 06:44.404
- Yeah, hi.
Uh, Woody, please.

06:44.447 --> 06:47.058
Uh, yesterday the Mayor
mentioned that I should contact

06:47.102 --> 06:50.105
her friend Greg about hosting
a fundraising event,

06:50.148 --> 06:53.195
but for the life of me,
I can't remember his last name.

06:53.238 --> 06:55.371
- Was it Greg Terwilliger
from the DA's office?

06:55.415 --> 06:57.765
- Greg Terwilliger, no,
that doesn't sound familiar.

06:57.808 --> 07:00.594
I-I feel like he had
a short last name.

07:00.637 --> 07:03.945
- That's the only Greg I know,
but give me a sec.

07:11.518 --> 07:15.696
Okay, she has three other
Gregs in her contact list.

07:15.739 --> 07:20.962
Greg Long, Gregory Stafford,
and Greg Bachmann.

07:21.005 --> 07:24.444
- Greg...
both: Bachmann.

07:27.185 --> 07:28.970
- Take it nice and easy,
all right?

07:29.013 --> 07:31.451
- Yeah. Sure.

07:39.676 --> 07:41.199
Police!

07:57.259 --> 07:59.043
- Only one way to find out.

♪

08:15.233 --> 08:17.018
You call that nice and easy?

08:17.061 --> 08:18.410
- Stolen plates.

08:18.454 --> 08:21.675
Probable cause to search
the vehicle, right?

08:21.718 --> 08:23.546
Shit.

08:23.590 --> 08:27.071
- Well, that was a bust.

08:27.115 --> 08:28.595
I'll call my guys in Auto.

08:28.638 --> 08:30.988
- Nah, I think we should wait
until he shows up.

08:31.032 --> 08:33.208
- There was no one in there!

08:33.251 --> 08:36.951
What, we arrest a guy
for stealing a crappy RV?

08:36.994 --> 08:39.040
- No, this isn't
about a stolen RV.

08:39.083 --> 08:41.477
- You seem really sure
about this.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.435
Is there anything
you're not telling me?

08:43.479 --> 08:46.003
Because this does not work
without complete trust.

08:46.047 --> 08:48.049
I know that from experience.

08:51.052 --> 08:54.272

I am to see you, Tess.
