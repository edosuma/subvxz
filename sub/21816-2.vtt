02:18.596 --> 02:19.597
Listen up!

02:20.431 --> 02:21.724
I got a nozzle here.

03:15.069 --> 03:18.323
<i>Is it making its way down canyon</i>
<i>or going with the inward slope?</i>

03:19.157 --> 03:21.993
<i>It's pretty well established</i>
<i>down into the growth,</i>

03:22.076 --> 03:25.121
<i>and it's working its way</i>
<i>around with the slope.</i>

03:37.008 --> 03:38.843
Hustle up, right here!

03:40.845 --> 03:42.597
Try and get the heat out of that.

03:49.812 --> 03:51.689
Who the fuck knocked this out?

04:11.626 --> 04:12.543
Too hot!

04:16.339 --> 04:18.091
-It's too hot!
-Too hot?

04:18.675 --> 04:19.968
Way too hot!

04:24.305 --> 04:25.515
What are you doing?

04:25.932 --> 04:27.475
Drive this thing forward!

04:28.142 --> 04:31.062
Move this forward! Drive this truck!

04:31.145 --> 04:33.064
Drive the truck down the hill!

04:33.648 --> 04:35.066
Go, come on!

05:00.550 --> 05:01.592
Okay.

05:02.885 --> 05:03.720
Okay!

05:06.347 --> 05:07.473
Stop!

05:11.769 --> 05:12.729
Stop!

17:16.702 --> 17:18.871
Your chin looks like a nut sack now?

40:07.405 --> 40:08.864
I'm gonna saw!

40:09.865 --> 40:11.283
I'm really excited!

40:11.867 --> 40:13.077
This is the best part!

46:52.392 --> 46:54.394
And I've been to so many rehabs.

46:54.478 --> 46:56.647
I've done it all.
I've done it all.

46:57.564 --> 46:59.608
I think I really just needed to get away.

47:00.984 --> 47:03.779
You know?
In order to stay clean this time.

49:28.298 --> 49:31.259
<i>I understand that. It's clear.</i>
<i>But I cannot do fifty,</i>

49:31.343 --> 49:33.178
<i>so what can you get by with?</i>

49:33.261 --> 49:35.639
<i>We can get by with whatever you give us.</i>

49:36.598 --> 49:37.599
<i>Okay.</i>
