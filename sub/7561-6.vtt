01:27.000 --> 01:29.159
Hello, sir. How may I help you?

01:30.160 --> 01:31.959
Tell this guy to leave.

01:41.800 --> 01:42.959
There you go.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.479
I want to look like that.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.679
You look gay.
- What's up with Milan?

02:13.000 --> 02:16.919
They're looking for him.
Listen, about that trip...

02:17.960 --> 02:20.239
I haven't been to London
in ten years.

02:21.240 --> 02:24.199
It's already giving me an erection.

02:25.200 --> 02:29.039
I don't know. I don't like
that so few of us are going.

02:30.520 --> 02:33.199
Don't worry, Miki. It will be fine.

02:34.240 --> 02:36.079
It's a new start.

02:37.760 --> 02:38.759
Okay.

03:10.400 --> 03:12.799
You're scaring us.
This makes no sense.

03:12.920 --> 03:15.479
Don't worry.
There's nothing to fear.

03:15.600 --> 03:20.119
You say: Pack. We don't know where we
are going. Why shouldn't we be afraid?

03:41.880 --> 03:46.799
A boat. You're putting us on a boat?
Where are you sailing us...

03:49.280 --> 03:50.439
Crap.

03:52.600 --> 03:56.559
- I told you not to come, not like this.
- I wanted to be here.

04:04.560 --> 04:05.719
Hello.

04:08.240 --> 04:10.879
I know you don't want to see me, Mom.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.359
I just needed to check.

04:13.400 --> 04:14.999
To be sure you'd be safe.

04:15.480 --> 04:17.199
So, this is about you?

04:18.400 --> 04:19.879
Is this about him?

04:20.080 --> 04:22.719
- Please don't start.
- Why are we on a boat?

04:22.840 --> 04:24.679
We have a right to know.

04:25.720 --> 04:27.119
You've changed.

04:30.560 --> 04:32.159
- It's me, Mother.
- Is it?

04:33.560 --> 04:34.719
I'm not so sure.

04:36.360 --> 04:40.199
It seems like you, but... You changed,
or I forgot how you were.

04:41.200 --> 04:42.359
I don't know.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.159
I'm sorry, Mom.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.159
Why are we here?

04:51.080 --> 04:54.839
- You didn't tell them?
- No, they'd have freaked out.

04:55.080 --> 04:56.519
- They should.
- What is this?

04:56.640 --> 04:59.279
I can't tell you.
Now, do as you're told.

04:59.560 --> 05:00.639
You're safe here.

05:01.520 --> 05:04.239
You'll stay
until Khalil and I sort this out.

05:07.160 --> 05:10.239
Trust me, Mom. You just need
to stay here a few days.

05:10.360 --> 05:12.119
And please don't go out.

05:24.680 --> 05:27.599
- Where are you going?
- Did you have to show up?

05:28.600 --> 05:30.639
I can't talk here. Follow me.

05:41.560 --> 05:43.199
The keys are inside.

05:46.800 --> 05:50.879
- Soon, this will all be mine.
- Yes, soon all this will be flats.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.159
Our airport will be even prettier.

06:03.120 --> 06:06.719
- What's that?
- It's who my guys and I plan to hit.

06:08.280 --> 06:12.279
When someone wants to kill you,
you must kill them first.

06:12.400 --> 06:16.079
- You've got to be joking.
- Do I look like I'm joking?

06:16.280 --> 06:20.119
You came to me, terrified,
and now you want me to agree

06:20.240 --> 06:24.439
to twelve murders? I should turn
a blind eye to that? Really?

06:24.600 --> 06:27.919
I'm a desperate man,
just trying to protect my family.

06:28.040 --> 06:31.159
Wait a bit. I'll arrest them. Okay?

06:31.280 --> 06:33.119
Arrest them? Then what?

06:34.040 --> 06:37.799
Hold them for a few days, so when they
get out they'll kill us all?

06:37.960 --> 06:39.119
No.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.039
Surprise is only on our side
for a limited time.

06:45.200 --> 06:46.599
Just keep the cops away.

06:47.560 --> 06:49.999
Let us take out all those bastards.

06:50.120 --> 06:54.639
Calm down, okay?
Your family is safe. I'm okay.

06:54.760 --> 06:58.999
Lay low. I'll wait for their reaction,
then I'll bust them.

07:01.040 --> 07:03.079
You, taking people out.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.279
The minister gave me two tasks:

08:12.600 --> 08:15.159
make as many professional contacts
as I can,

08:15.280 --> 08:18.799
and keep all of you
from getting arrested.

08:18.920 --> 08:20.719
Is it your first trip to London?

08:21.720 --> 08:23.839
No, we did a heist here in 2006.

08:24.840 --> 08:26.839
Harry Winston's on Bond Street.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.439
Two million in uncut diamonds.

08:30.440 --> 08:33.719
You know, we could do it again,
now that we're here.

08:38.560 --> 08:40.719
It's our first trip to England.

08:43.400 --> 08:44.639
I did my doctorate here.

08:45.680 --> 08:49.839
The food is bland. So are the people,
but they're very clever.

08:49.960 --> 08:54.959
Don't forget they ruled the world.
Don't trust anyone. Certainly not her.

08:55.120 --> 08:56.759
She's Spanish, but wants to be English.

08:56.880 --> 08:58.719
You're the one who introduced us to her.

08:58.840 --> 09:00.759
I thought you'd get on well.

09:06.280 --> 09:07.999
I'll see you later.

11:52.160 --> 11:53.159
Help.

11:53.360 --> 11:57.399
Knife attack on Chave Boulevard.
Attacker on the run.

11:57.520 --> 12:01.399
Gunfire in public restrooms
at the coast. Victim deceased.

12:01.520 --> 12:03.959
Attacker probably fled the scene.

12:04.080 --> 12:09.839
5 dead on Corniche beach.
Anyone in the vicinity, call in please.

12:19.040 --> 12:20.199
Leave a message.

13:52.680 --> 13:53.839
Hey, cool place.

13:55.800 --> 13:59.759
- Who's that guy? Who is he?
- I don't go anywhere alone anymore.

14:00.760 --> 14:03.919
- Who do you think you are?
- What's wrong with you?

14:04.080 --> 14:06.399
- You tricked me.
- What do you mean?

14:06.560 --> 14:07.719
Stop.

14:11.800 --> 14:12.959
Who are you?

14:14.120 --> 14:18.199
I'm your brother, your fucking savior.
I'm the one keeping you alive.

14:18.320 --> 14:22.079
Shut up. I didn't need you.
I didn't need you.

14:26.280 --> 14:30.239
- I'm just trying to keep us alive.
- Who told you to do that?

14:31.240 --> 14:34.599
- Who? Who told you to do that?
- Well, I did.

14:36.920 --> 14:38.519
Thanks for letting me.

14:39.120 --> 14:42.919
What are you going to do about it,
big guy? Am I under arrest?

14:53.160 --> 14:54.239
Piss off.

14:55.120 --> 14:57.279
Piss off. Get out. Get out.

17:01.440 --> 17:02.599
Welcome.

20:24.320 --> 20:27.839
It seems someone is
doing your job for you.

20:30.640 --> 20:32.639
I'm going to find out who did this.

20:33.640 --> 20:38.159
Now that Roman's gone,
someone's trying to take control.

20:38.280 --> 20:41.319
They're very professional.
It's impressive.

20:41.440 --> 20:42.599
Impressive?

20:44.760 --> 20:47.719
If rats bite other rats, no-one cares.

20:47.840 --> 20:51.119
You don't react at all
until they bite your baby.

20:51.240 --> 20:55.519
So, go ahead. Do your job.
But don't push too hard.

20:56.680 --> 21:00.799
Roman understood one thing.
When they kill each other,

21:02.000 --> 21:04.839
that's not really our problem.

21:04.960 --> 21:08.119
But maybe you're too young
to understand that.

22:10.400 --> 22:11.799
I'm gonna fuck you up!

22:39.680 --> 22:40.839
Who killed him?

22:41.880 --> 22:42.959
You or Zlatko?

24:53.920 --> 24:55.959
It was you I missed most when I left.

24:57.840 --> 25:01.839
I used to sit up at night, having
dumb pretend conversations with you.

25:01.960 --> 25:04.279
I imagine you won every argument.

25:05.840 --> 25:11.719
I don't know. You were...
You were my little brother.

25:13.120 --> 25:14.319
And...

25:15.800 --> 25:18.599
Can we get in the car?
I'm a bit chilly.

25:21.240 --> 25:22.399
Okay.

25:41.160 --> 25:43.119
One king to rule them all.

25:46.640 --> 25:50.239
We can trust each other.
Not like those bastards, Manu and Roman.

25:50.360 --> 25:53.639
No. No, I can't do that.
We can't do that.

25:53.760 --> 25:57.679
- Khalil.
- No, listen. Listen. You're going to...

26:01.680 --> 26:06.519
I'm going to think. I will
work out a solution. We... I will...

26:06.640 --> 26:09.319
- Yes?
- Khalil Rachedi?

26:43.400 --> 26:48.359
We'll find a solution. When I get back
from London, we'll talk. Okay?

26:49.280 --> 26:52.639
- You're going to arrest Milan Celik?
- Yes. Huh?

26:55.120 --> 26:56.919
You can't arrest Milan Celik.

26:57.880 --> 27:01.639
Why? What do you mean?
I can't arrest Milan Celik?

27:01.760 --> 27:03.079
He can identify me.

27:05.400 --> 27:09.479
He can identify you?
What are you saying? For what?

27:17.080 --> 27:18.239
Oh.

27:28.360 --> 27:31.999
The robbery.
It was you who sold them the guns?

27:36.400 --> 27:37.559
Mokhtar?

27:43.240 --> 27:44.559
Hey, you.

27:49.200 --> 27:53.279
Hit me again, hit me just one more
time, and I swear you'll regret it.

27:54.280 --> 27:57.399
Always playing the big brother,
aren't you?

27:57.520 --> 28:00.999
Things have changed.
They've changed, Khalil.

28:02.800 --> 28:05.639
You get it? You see who I've become?

28:08.120 --> 28:09.279
Do you get it?

28:22.000 --> 28:25.559
And I'm powerful, Khalil, thanks to you.

28:25.680 --> 28:27.879
From now on, you'll do as I say.

28:28.000 --> 28:32.039
You made a choice, as soon as we went
after Roman. Accept that choice.

28:32.160 --> 28:33.719
Please, accept it.

36:07.760 --> 36:09.039
Yes?

36:10.200 --> 36:11.359
Who is it?

36:13.320 --> 36:14.479
It's me.

37:49.520 --> 37:51.119
What are you doing here?

37:55.440 --> 37:56.599
What?

37:58.360 --> 38:00.119
Are you here to arrest me?

38:06.560 --> 38:09.039
Did I put too much pressure on you?

38:11.360 --> 38:12.519
I'll sort it out.

38:16.040 --> 38:18.879
It's the end, Khalil. We succeeded.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.919
You and me, together.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.519
Khalil, you can't do that.

38:38.120 --> 38:40.239
I'm your brother, Khalil.

42:13.000 --> 42:17.079
I haven't missed you, nitwit.
I'll have to shit in a bag from now on.

43:02.560 --> 43:04.039
You dirty son of a...

46:12.120 --> 46:13.959
Come back soon, okay?

46:14.080 --> 46:15.479
Yeah, I promise.

46:24.440 --> 46:26.199
Stay safe, son.

46:27.680 --> 46:29.199
You stay safe, Mom.

46:31.160 --> 46:33.519
Just find the person who did this.

46:46.120 --> 46:47.719
Of course I will, Mom.
