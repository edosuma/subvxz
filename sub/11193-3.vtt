WEBVTT

00:12.500 --> 00:14.871
All right, kids, we're due back.

00:14.900 --> 00:18.564
Unless you've discovered
something earth-shattering,...

00:18.539 --> 00:20.614
...I'm ready to bag this one.

00:20.660 --> 00:24.987
We just got here. We have no idea
what this planet has to offer.

00:24.939 --> 00:26.765
Trees and moss.

00:26.820 --> 00:29.106
A few miles from the Stargate, yes, but...

00:29.140 --> 00:33.384
Captain, any signs of radio traffic
in the last 24 hours?

00:33.340 --> 00:36.256
Any chemical traces
to indicate civilisation?

00:36.259 --> 00:37.125
None, sir.

00:37.220 --> 00:40.054
Ah...! Ah!

00:40.060 --> 00:44.387
We'll, uh, flag it for an aerial survey.
As much as I love a good rainforest, I...

00:44.341 --> 00:45.750
<i>O'Neill.</i>

00:51.941 --> 00:54.395
<i>Help me...</i>

00:56.060 --> 00:59.475
If they find me... Taldor...

00:59.460 --> 01:01.451
- Who?
- Taldor.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.491
If they find me now...

01:03.540 --> 01:04.950
Daniel?

01:05.021 --> 01:08.103
Uh... Taldor... I-I have no idea.

01:08.100 --> 01:10.140
If they find me, they find you.

01:10.180 --> 01:12.302
Taldor is bad?

01:12.340 --> 01:14.084
All around us now.

01:14.141 --> 01:18.088
All right, all right,
we're surrounded by Taldor.

01:18.061 --> 01:19.969
Fine. Just relax.

01:20.021 --> 01:22.557
Come with us. Come on.

01:25.460 --> 01:26.954
All right,...

01:27.061 --> 01:30.144
...keep an eye out for Taldor, I guess.

01:39.502 --> 01:40.700
Taldor.

01:40.781 --> 01:43.021
What the hell is that?

01:43.983 --> 01:46.021
It comes for us.

01:46.061 --> 01:47.472
What?!

01:58.902 --> 02:00.939
Everybody all right?

02:01.182 --> 02:03.221
<i>You are prisoners.</i>

02:03.262 --> 02:06.629
<i>And you are...?</i>

02:06.623 --> 02:09.455
Justice. Taldor means justice.

02:09.461 --> 02:11.501
It just came to me.

02:11.981 --> 02:15.313
<i>You trespass on ancient grounds.</i>

02:15.301 --> 02:17.971
Hey, look, we didn't mean to trespass.

02:17.983 --> 02:22.275
We're explorers.
We came through the Stargate from Earth.

02:22.223 --> 02:26.467
<i>It does not matter who you are.
You helped Roshure.</i>

02:26.423 --> 02:28.046
What? Who, this guy?

02:28.103 --> 02:29.561
Yeah?

02:29.622 --> 02:31.864
<i>Then you share in his crime.</i>

02:31.903 --> 02:33.942
What crime?

02:33.983 --> 02:35.808
<i>Murder.</i>

02:35.862 --> 02:37.901
All right, look,...

02:37.942 --> 02:40.562
...we don't know anything about...
a murder.

02:40.582 --> 02:44.709
He was running from something.
He stopped for help. We helped.

02:44.663 --> 02:47.199
<i>For the crimes of trespassing,...</i>

02:47.223 --> 02:51.514
<i>- Anybody wanna jump in?
- ...of aiding a murderer,...</i>

02:51.463 --> 02:55.079
We had no intention of
interfering with your justice system.

02:55.063 --> 02:57.600
<i>.. of carrying weapons,...</i>

02:57.623 --> 03:00.030
We're trained to defend ourselves.

03:00.063 --> 03:02.897
<i>.. you will be sent
through the Stargate...</i>

03:04.943 --> 03:06.271
Thank you.

03:06.343 --> 03:08.466
<i>.. to the prison Hadante...</i>

03:08.503 --> 03:13.544
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
This is just a misunderstanding!

03:13.463 --> 03:15.788
<i>.. for the remainder of your lives.</i>

04:25.105 --> 04:26.564
Urgh!

04:26.706 --> 04:27.821
Agh!

04:33.226 --> 04:35.182
<i>Hey!</i>

04:42.425 --> 04:43.884
Well,...

04:43.947 --> 04:45.689
...this sucks.

05:04.266 --> 05:07.384
- Why are they whistling?
- O'Neill.

05:10.666 --> 05:13.038
- Oh, my God.
- What?

05:15.586 --> 05:17.744
The wounds are cauterised.

05:17.786 --> 05:19.197
Yeah. So?

05:19.266 --> 05:22.598
So whoever it was must have been
next to the gate when it opened.

05:22.588 --> 05:25.124
<i>Disintegrated by the vortex.</i>

05:25.146 --> 05:27.896
<i>Why would anyone do that?</i>

05:32.586 --> 05:34.459
It's OK.

05:34.507 --> 05:38.288
We're not gonna hurt you.
Please, we just wanna talk to you.

05:38.268 --> 05:41.137
It's all right. We just wanna talk to you.

05:41.148 --> 05:41.928
Captain Carter!

05:43.827 --> 05:45.534
Agh!

05:45.588 --> 05:46.832
Vishnoor!

06:03.627 --> 06:06.581
You have been sent
through the great circle.

06:06.588 --> 06:07.915
Yes, but...

06:07.987 --> 06:12.067
Your sentence is life imprisonment,
or you would not be here.

06:12.028 --> 06:13.439
I am Linea.

06:13.507 --> 06:16.923
I'm Daniel. This is Jack,
Captain Carter and Teal'c.

06:16.908 --> 06:20.987
If you're the one who stopped this attack,
uh, I suppose we're grateful.

06:23.389 --> 06:26.471
This woman is under my protection.

06:27.509 --> 06:31.005
- She is not to be taken by any man.
- It's all right.

06:32.790 --> 06:34.911
Is that clear, Vishnoor?

06:37.670 --> 06:39.707
Is that clear?

06:45.949 --> 06:47.490
You were saying?

06:47.548 --> 06:49.340
Uh,...

06:49.389 --> 06:52.057
...that I can take care of myself.

06:52.069 --> 06:54.108
I mean you no disrespect,...

06:54.149 --> 06:57.516
...but I know what it is
to be a woman in Hadante.

07:02.709 --> 07:06.622
For what little it is worth, welcome.

07:07.269 --> 07:09.725
Oh, uh, excuse me, but...

07:09.750 --> 07:14.908
Daniel, I think that's about it
for the welcome wagon.

07:14.829 --> 07:16.869
You all right?

07:16.910 --> 07:18.154
Yes, sir.

07:19.949 --> 07:23.033
OK, kids, this is our situation.

07:23.029 --> 07:25.151
What do we need?

07:25.189 --> 07:27.146
A dial-home device would be nice.

07:27.189 --> 07:30.475
OK, let's assume
we don't find one of those. What else?

07:30.471 --> 07:33.305
Power, to free the superconductive ring
on the Stargate.

07:33.310 --> 07:36.973
- So that we may dial the gate manually.
- It's worked before.

07:36.951 --> 07:40.399
Right.
So we're lookin' for a power source.

07:40.391 --> 07:42.596
Teal'c, look scary and take point.

07:57.391 --> 07:58.470
Uh,...

07:58.550 --> 08:00.589
...we're with him.

08:08.870 --> 08:11.538
It's like we're in Botany Bay.

08:11.552 --> 08:12.961
What?

08:13.630 --> 08:16.713
Oh, the original name for Sydney Harbour.

08:16.711 --> 08:19.283
When the British colonised Australia,...

08:19.312 --> 08:22.975
...they turned it into a continental prison.
It was half a world away.

08:22.952 --> 08:25.822
Of course, this is probably more than that.

08:25.831 --> 08:27.954
It's OK, Daniel. It's OK.

08:31.750 --> 08:35.830
Perhaps the Taldor believe
the Stargate only goes here.

08:35.792 --> 08:38.197
Wherever "here" is.

08:53.392 --> 08:55.466
Here, a gift.

08:55.513 --> 08:59.046
- You killed him?
- No, no, no, not me.

08:59.033 --> 09:01.024
Killed himself. Not me.

09:01.072 --> 09:02.482
Right...

09:06.513 --> 09:07.971
Here.

09:08.033 --> 09:11.365
- For you.
- In exchange for...?

09:11.352 --> 09:14.969
Like Linea.
A gift... for the protected one.

09:19.592 --> 09:21.631
You are very strong, yes?

09:21.673 --> 09:23.711
I am.

09:23.754 --> 09:27.120
Maybe you challenge Vishnoor.
Maybe you win.

09:27.113 --> 09:29.863
Maybe... I be your friend.

09:31.072 --> 09:33.110
Maybe not.

09:40.712 --> 09:42.538
OK.

09:44.234 --> 09:47.932
Daniel, you and Teal'c
keep lookin' around Botany Bay here.

09:47.913 --> 09:50.403
Carter and I are gonna have a chat with...?

09:50.434 --> 09:51.927
Linea.

09:51.993 --> 09:53.902
Right.

09:53.953 --> 09:58.413
Something's generating the power here,
and she seems to be in charge. OK?

10:01.793 --> 10:03.832
Oh, Daniel.

10:05.673 --> 10:07.914
You gotta trust me on this.

10:09.673 --> 10:13.504
Signs of weakness
are not a good thing in prison.

10:16.315 --> 10:19.183
Sir, without our remote transmitters...

10:19.193 --> 10:23.190
General Hammond will send another
SG team as soon as we're overdue.

10:23.154 --> 10:25.525
Help me, please! They're after me!

10:25.554 --> 10:27.380
Get out!

10:32.154 --> 10:34.192
Get outta here!

10:34.634 --> 10:38.761
- What do you think they'll do to him?
- Not our problem, Captain.

10:49.715 --> 10:52.834
We're getting SG-3's
remote transmitter signal, sir.

10:52.835 --> 10:55.835
Let's hope they found SG-1. Open the iris.

11:08.395 --> 11:11.846
Have them report directly
to the briefing room.

11:11.836 --> 11:13.458
Yes, sir.

11:23.475 --> 11:26.558
Sooner or later
all new arrivals come here.

11:28.836 --> 11:31.835
You are not from any island state
under the Taldor?

11:31.836 --> 11:33.246
Uh...

11:33.316 --> 11:35.354
No, we're from Earth.

11:36.157 --> 11:38.195
Earth is...

11:38.915 --> 11:40.991
Well, it's way out there.

11:41.037 --> 11:45.033
Then you are from a place
of which I have no knowledge.

11:46.836 --> 11:48.911
Do you intend to challenge me?

11:48.956 --> 11:51.576
All we really wanna do is get outta here.

11:54.397 --> 11:57.729
Get out of here?
We are deep underground.

11:57.716 --> 12:03.419
It is my understanding the great circle
transported us to a different world.

12:03.317 --> 12:06.400
One that once teemed with life,
but no more.

12:06.397 --> 12:10.061
This place, thousands of years old,...

12:10.037 --> 12:12.075
...is all that remains.

12:13.596 --> 12:15.967
That's why the Taldor
turned it into a prison.

12:15.998 --> 12:17.620
They could see no other use.

12:17.677 --> 12:21.673
So, bottom line,
the Stargate is the only way in or out.

12:21.636 --> 12:26.260
Many here believe that when a prisoner
comes through the Stargate...

12:26.197 --> 12:32.067
...they can be caught in the circle's
great wave and returned to the other side.

12:31.957 --> 12:34.197
<i>Actually,...</i>

12:36.158 --> 12:37.782
...they die.

12:39.038 --> 12:42.868
You see, what you just referred to as
"the great wave"...

12:42.837 --> 12:46.750
...is actually an unstable vortex
generated when the gate first opens.

12:46.717 --> 12:49.919
Anything inside its radius is disintegrated.

12:49.918 --> 12:53.332
There was a pair of smoking feet
when we got here.

12:53.317 --> 12:57.480
There are two ways, and two ways only,
to control a society.

12:57.438 --> 12:59.476
Through fear or through hope.

13:00.318 --> 13:02.855
In this world, fear is a constant.

13:02.879 --> 13:07.124
The belief in escape,
whether founded or not, allows hope.

13:07.077 --> 13:10.077
So... out of hope,...

13:10.078 --> 13:12.913
...these people are killing themselves?

13:12.918 --> 13:15.041
If they believe it is escape,...

13:15.078 --> 13:17.201
...who am I to say it is not?

13:17.958 --> 13:20.081
Well, we have a better way.

13:20.119 --> 13:21.659
What would you ask of me?

13:23.798 --> 13:25.755
We need power.

13:25.798 --> 13:29.546
There are many forms of power, my dear.
Some more subtle than others.

13:29.519 --> 13:32.932
For the moment
we just need the electrical kind.

13:32.918 --> 13:35.623
Then we both have something
the other wants.

13:42.759 --> 13:47.503
They handed you SG-1's weapons and
transmitters with no further explanation?

13:47.440 --> 13:50.642
Only that they'd been accused of a crime
and sent to prison.

13:50.639 --> 13:52.429
What crime?

13:52.480 --> 13:55.052
They said it wasn't my concern
and sent me away.

13:55.078 --> 13:57.236
I was going to take my men back, but...

13:57.278 --> 13:59.947
You did the right thing returning to base.

13:59.960 --> 14:04.999
From what you tell me, this has become
a diplomatic problem. That means SG-9.

14:04.919 --> 14:08.998
I've long believed that the best way
to get knowledge is to give it.

14:10.720 --> 14:13.091
These are my activators.

14:25.041 --> 14:27.495
Is this a... a chemical reaction?

14:27.520 --> 14:29.227
Much more.

14:33.520 --> 14:36.889
The liquid permeates
the hard core of the tare root...

14:36.880 --> 14:40.580
...and lets the organic material within
interact on a basic level.

14:40.561 --> 14:42.054
Basic meaning...?

14:42.120 --> 14:45.155
That which we cannot see,
but of which all is made.

14:45.921 --> 14:47.959
- Subatomic.
- Ah.

14:49.760 --> 14:53.673
Are we talking about
organically-based cold fusion?

14:54.042 --> 14:56.163
I do not know your terminology.

14:56.201 --> 15:00.279
Uh, what you call basics, we call atoms.

15:00.241 --> 15:05.696
Groups of protons, neutrons, electrons.
The basic building blocks of all matter.

15:05.601 --> 15:11.638
My activators spirit these materials to
combine within the cells of the tare root.

15:11.520 --> 15:14.140
When material is made,
energy is released,...

15:14.163 --> 15:17.115
...flowing through the tendrils of the plant.

15:17.121 --> 15:19.825
- Colonel, that's cold fusion.
- Mm.

15:19.841 --> 15:23.754
Whatever organic mineral the roots
are made of serves as a catalyst,...

15:23.721 --> 15:27.302
...causing the atoms of her chemicals
to fuse together.

15:27.282 --> 15:29.902
If we had this on Earth,
we'd eliminate pollution.

15:29.922 --> 15:32.412
Captain,... back to basics.

15:32.442 --> 15:34.480
Will it power the Stargate?

15:38.243 --> 15:39.820
It might.

15:40.881 --> 15:43.798
<i>Activate the great circle from this side?</i>

15:43.802 --> 15:46.673
The permutations number in the billions.

15:46.682 --> 15:48.721
It's incalculable.

15:49.761 --> 15:52.298
Well, actually she figured it out.

15:53.043 --> 15:55.615
- You?
- Oh, it was a team effort really...

15:55.644 --> 15:56.557
How?

15:56.643 --> 15:58.018
Uh, well...

15:58.082 --> 16:00.120
Tell you what.

16:01.082 --> 16:03.121
Provide the power we need...

16:03.962 --> 16:06.001
...and we'll take you with us.

16:06.043 --> 16:08.200
Only then will you share the knowledge?

16:08.243 --> 16:10.365
That's the deal.

16:13.003 --> 16:15.788
Teal'c, I think he's had enough.

16:15.802 --> 16:21.008
If you once again try to physically harm
myself or any of my companions,...

16:20.923 --> 16:23.248
...my patience with you will expire.

16:26.363 --> 16:27.940
Well, Teal'c...

16:28.003 --> 16:30.042
Makin' friends, are you?

16:30.083 --> 16:32.289
We found nothing of use.

16:32.323 --> 16:36.650
I'm fairly certain this structure
is the ruins of some alien gate terminal,...

16:36.604 --> 16:38.725
...probably over 15,000 years old.

16:38.764 --> 16:42.011
That almost certainly predates
human civilisation.

16:42.004 --> 16:45.537
Which is not of any use... per se.

16:46.043 --> 16:48.082
We may have found what we need.

16:48.124 --> 16:52.451
Linea has a power source. Not just
any source either. This is incredible.

16:52.403 --> 16:54.195
She's just gonna hand it over?

16:57.485 --> 16:59.523
If we take her back with us.

17:00.245 --> 17:03.363
Can we just do that?
We don't know what she's in here for.

17:03.364 --> 17:06.862
- What are we in here for?
- Jaywalking, I think.

17:06.845 --> 17:12.346
Clearly Linea has done something
to earn the respect of these prisoners.

17:12.243 --> 17:16.454
When she warned that man to stay away
from Sam, I saw fear in his eyes,...

17:16.404 --> 17:18.230
...not respect.

17:18.285 --> 17:22.944
I'm just going to assume
you've never been in prison before.

17:22.884 --> 17:25.458
Oh, right. And you have?

17:27.924 --> 17:29.963
Oh, yeah.

17:30.005 --> 17:33.787
Any place like this has its own rules.
They don't have to make sense.

17:33.765 --> 17:37.843
Linea's obviously done
whatever she's needed to do to survive,...

17:37.806 --> 17:39.844
...just like we are.

17:39.884 --> 17:42.042
Speaking of which...

17:42.085 --> 17:47.208
Colonel, we're talking about powering one
completely alien device with another.

17:47.085 --> 17:49.753
It's not like splicing together a few wires.

17:49.766 --> 17:51.638
I'll take that as a maybe?

17:52.205 --> 17:57.279
Without remote transmitters, we still have
no access to Earth. The iris will be closed.

17:58.286 --> 18:04.286
Daniel, you know more addresses than
any of us. Start thinking of alternatives.

18:06.247 --> 18:08.368
Incoming.

18:18.526 --> 18:20.565
You eat last.

19:11.886 --> 19:13.925
Thank you, Vishnoor.

20:17.848 --> 20:22.010
Sir, SG-1 broke the law on P3X-775.

20:22.569 --> 20:25.605
We don't have to agree with it,
but we may have to respect it.

20:25.608 --> 20:28.358
Sounds like they just made
an honest mistake.

20:28.369 --> 20:30.609
We tried to explain that, sir.

20:30.648 --> 20:35.224
On Earth, unknowingly abetting a criminal
doesn't merit this kind of punishment.

20:35.170 --> 20:38.619
However, the Taldor, the judicial body,...

20:38.609 --> 20:40.897
...they believe in zero tolerance.

20:40.930 --> 20:42.588
No appeals process.

20:42.651 --> 20:46.267
Essentially life imprisonment
for nearly all offences.

20:46.250 --> 20:47.991
Doesn't sound like justice.

20:48.049 --> 20:51.665
Perhaps not, sir, but the fact is
they have virtually no crime.

20:51.651 --> 20:55.267
Just crimes of passion.
Sometimes the occasional sociopath.

20:55.250 --> 20:58.865
- General, sir, SG-3 is prepared to go in.
- No, sir!

20:58.851 --> 21:01.684
With all due respect,
force isn't the answer, sir.

21:01.691 --> 21:03.813
They're far more advanced than we are.

21:03.849 --> 21:07.928
We couldn't succeed in extracting SG-1
and we'd just be making an enemy.

21:07.891 --> 21:10.676
- They've already made an enemy.
- No, I disagree.

21:11.930 --> 21:15.298
Sir, they're open to relations with us.

21:15.290 --> 21:18.207
Next time, members of the Taldor
will show their faces.

21:18.211 --> 21:21.079
Sir, this is nuts. Let my team go back.

21:21.089 --> 21:26.758
Major, as of 0800 tomorrow, your unit
is scheduled for a recon of P2A-509.

21:26.651 --> 21:29.188
I expect you to be ready for your mission.

21:29.211 --> 21:31.250
Yes, sir.

21:31.290 --> 21:34.824
Major Kovacek, return to P3X-775.

21:34.810 --> 21:37.051
Let them know we mean business.

21:38.011 --> 21:41.461
Better yet, I'll tell them myself.

22:09.732 --> 22:11.226
I treat it before ingesting.

22:11.291 --> 22:15.334
Better than what you scraped
from the bottom of the barrel.

22:15.372 --> 22:16.747
Uh, thank you.

22:16.813 --> 22:18.934
I came to ask you something.

22:18.972 --> 22:21.344
- My crime.
- Yeah.

22:22.612 --> 22:27.817
There was an experiment
with tragic consequences. People died.

22:27.731 --> 22:30.767
- How many people?
- Thousands.

22:30.771 --> 22:34.388
It began with a plague
among the people who sent you here.

22:34.372 --> 22:36.862
Time was short. I offered my knowledge.

22:37.893 --> 22:41.557
Instead of inhibiting
the disease's progress,...

22:41.532 --> 22:45.363
- ...my medicine accelerated its effects.
- And they blamed you?

22:45.332 --> 22:46.707
Yes.

22:46.772 --> 22:50.306
I'm not surprised.
We didn't deserve this either.

22:50.292 --> 22:52.450
Do not think that I am innocent.

22:53.492 --> 22:56.942
You're saying that
you take responsibility for your actions.

22:56.932 --> 22:58.971
Yes.

23:02.093 --> 23:04.760
I have decided to accept your offer.

23:04.772 --> 23:05.887
Great.

23:05.972 --> 23:08.011
I'll tell the colonel.

23:08.053 --> 23:12.511
You have altered the balance
of power here. I have no choice.

23:12.453 --> 23:14.161
I don't understand.

23:14.213 --> 23:19.336
It is only a matter of time before Vishnoor
and his followers challenge your friends.

23:19.253 --> 23:20.877
I'll warn them. Thank you.

23:20.933 --> 23:24.384
Tell them also that if they fail...

23:24.373 --> 23:27.373
...they will not live to try again.

23:29.213 --> 23:31.039
OK.

23:34.814 --> 23:36.391
<i>We'd better hurry, sir.</i>

23:36.453 --> 23:40.699
The Taldor believe punctuality
is emblematic of civilised behaviour.

23:40.653 --> 23:44.816
We'll be transported upon arrival
to their tal'al, or speaking area.

23:44.773 --> 23:49.066
Once there, the Taldor may or may not
show you their actual face.

23:49.015 --> 23:52.429
- Why is that?
- To put it politely, they're xenophobic.

23:52.414 --> 23:56.279
- Frankly, they're arrogant, self-centred...
- I get the picture.

23:56.255 --> 23:59.752
But they do seem to want to
maintain diplomatic contact.

23:59.733 --> 24:04.060
<i>Special envoy,
you may embark when ready.</i>

24:14.375 --> 24:16.450
Well, here goes.

24:16.496 --> 24:19.494
Since this is your first time, sir,
some advice:

24:19.494 --> 24:22.863
It's better to exhale
prior to crossing the event horizon.

24:22.855 --> 24:27.348
One's instinct is to inhale
upon arriving on the other side. Also...

24:27.295 --> 24:30.377
I think I'll figure it out on the way.

24:30.855 --> 24:33.426
You sure they dialled the correct address?

24:33.454 --> 24:35.411
Yes, sir.

24:38.855 --> 24:41.605
The things I do for these people.

24:46.496 --> 24:49.448
OK, so Cimmeria's out. So is Chulak.

24:49.455 --> 24:50.949
Captain?

24:51.016 --> 24:54.015
She says she'll give us power
if we take her with us.

24:54.015 --> 24:57.181
Well, that's fine,
but we still need a destination.

24:57.175 --> 25:01.502
P3A-707 might work, but there's no telling
how long we'd be there...

25:03.415 --> 25:05.454
For cryin' out loud...

25:05.496 --> 25:07.119
Let's go.

25:14.176 --> 25:15.718
What's goin' on?

25:15.777 --> 25:18.064
<i>They think it's a way to escape.</i>

25:18.096 --> 25:20.930
- Excuse me! Listen to me!
- Daniel!

25:24.257 --> 25:25.585
This won't save you.

25:26.615 --> 25:28.691
Daniel, get outta there.

25:28.737 --> 25:32.020
- You won't escape. You'll die.
- Out of my way!

25:43.896 --> 25:45.010
Uh!

25:51.217 --> 25:53.672
How dare you interfere?

25:54.698 --> 25:59.156
<i>I was trying to save
those men's lives. They're dead now.</i>

25:59.096 --> 26:02.595
They haven't escaped anywhere.
They are dead!

26:02.577 --> 26:04.487
Vishnoor!

26:06.778 --> 26:08.604
Leave him.

26:09.538 --> 26:10.996
He challenges me.

26:11.897 --> 26:13.770
I accept.

26:13.817 --> 26:16.271
Roshure just threw his life away.

26:16.298 --> 26:18.373
It was his life.

26:18.417 --> 26:20.161
The rules are the rules.

26:20.218 --> 26:22.257
Even I must obey them.

26:33.337 --> 26:35.578
Linea, you can stop this!

26:35.617 --> 26:38.367
I told you this was going to happen.

26:40.298 --> 26:41.709
Teal'c!

26:42.298 --> 26:43.839
Teal'c!

27:00.818 --> 27:02.361
Agh!

27:14.420 --> 27:17.087
He's still alive... Just barely.

27:23.660 --> 27:25.865
<i>You are most punctual.</i>

27:25.898 --> 27:27.179
Thank you.

27:27.259 --> 27:29.086
<i>You are General Hammond?</i>

27:29.140 --> 27:33.717
Yes. I am responsible
for those people you have in prison.

27:33.660 --> 27:35.983
By using the word "responsible",...

27:36.019 --> 27:40.644
...the General is in no way assuming
accountability for the actions of SG-1.

27:40.579 --> 27:43.497
Sorry, sir.
I don't want you to end up in prison, too.

27:43.500 --> 27:48.491
On the contrary,
I would gladly hold myself responsible.

27:48.421 --> 27:51.336
I ordered them to this world
in the first place.

27:51.339 --> 27:53.461
<i>Is this an admission of guilt?</i>

27:53.500 --> 27:55.538
- No.
- Yes, it is.

27:55.579 --> 28:00.369
As a matter of fact, if you would allow me
to take the place of SG-1...

28:00.299 --> 28:02.789
<i>You ordered them
to aid a murderer?</i>

28:02.819 --> 28:04.230
No.

28:04.299 --> 28:07.834
<i>- Then you're not guilty.
- Not guilty.</i>

28:07.819 --> 28:10.984
<i>Assumption of guilt by proxy
is rejected.</i>

28:10.980 --> 28:13.849
If my people are not released,...

28:13.861 --> 28:19.778
...the imprisonment of the members
of SG-1 will be considered a hostile act.

28:19.661 --> 28:24.535
Peaceful relations between
our two worlds will end right here,...

28:24.461 --> 28:26.002
...right now.

28:26.059 --> 28:29.261
<i>- Our law is immutable.
- Your law is unjust!</i>

28:29.261 --> 28:32.048
- I'm not sure if...
- What's it going to be?

28:32.060 --> 28:34.763
<i>- Release is impossible.
- Why?</i>

28:34.780 --> 28:38.692
<i>There are no returns from Hadante.
For anyone.</i>

28:43.980 --> 28:45.391
There.

28:45.461 --> 28:47.500
I have done what I can.

28:51.781 --> 28:54.022
I don't understand what happened.

28:54.061 --> 28:55.970
Your friend prevailed.

29:01.382 --> 29:03.670
- What is your name?
- Simian.

29:03.701 --> 29:05.740
I took food.

29:05.781 --> 29:08.069
I was hungry, starving...

29:08.102 --> 29:10.307
They sent me here.

29:10.343 --> 29:11.836
Hold still...

29:11.902 --> 29:13.940
Hold still.

29:14.261 --> 29:16.300
He's blind.

29:16.342 --> 29:18.797
Yes, but not always so.

29:19.583 --> 29:22.154
It's taken from me a little each day.

29:24.383 --> 29:26.421
There will be pain.

29:56.383 --> 29:58.173
His eyes now see.

30:01.823 --> 30:03.862
You're welcome.

30:03.903 --> 30:06.144
He does not seem grateful.

30:07.503 --> 30:09.127
Daniel?

30:11.023 --> 30:14.142
Uh... What happened?

30:14.943 --> 30:17.564
Well, you actually won a fight, Danny boy.

30:18.542 --> 30:21.625
I don't particularly remember
getting the upper hand.

30:21.624 --> 30:24.078
Neither do I, but you must have.

30:24.104 --> 30:25.597
P2A-509.

30:29.344 --> 30:31.881
A little brain damage along the way?

30:31.903 --> 30:36.942
No, uh,... SG-3 was scheduled
to go on a mission to P2A-509.

30:36.864 --> 30:39.732
General Hammond said so
in our last briefing.

30:39.744 --> 30:43.443
We meet SG-3, and we use their
remote transmitters to get home.

30:43.423 --> 30:45.630
And this just came to you?

30:45.664 --> 30:48.237
No, this came to me
while I was suffocating.

30:48.944 --> 30:51.400
Then P2A-509 it is.

30:51.545 --> 30:55.836
Linea? Do they send food...
and I'll use that term loosely...

30:55.785 --> 30:58.452
Does it come through the gate
on a regular basis?

30:58.464 --> 31:00.422
Every day at the same time.

31:00.464 --> 31:03.548
All right. That's our window.
Will that work?

31:03.545 --> 31:08.750
Power the gate and manually dial in
while the other prisoners are off eating.

31:35.586 --> 31:37.542
What are they waiting for?

31:37.586 --> 31:39.957
They believe you killed Vishnoor.

31:39.986 --> 31:41.978
You must distribute the food.

32:09.067 --> 32:11.557
Whoa, whoa, whoa... Hey, hey, hey!

32:12.467 --> 32:13.580
They're first.

32:37.107 --> 32:39.145
Thank you.

32:51.748 --> 32:54.782
<i>OK, well, I guess...</i>

33:54.869 --> 33:56.909
<i>OK, that's it.</i>

33:57.709 --> 33:59.202
Address?

34:28.230 --> 34:29.427
Escape!

34:29.789 --> 34:31.829
Escape!

34:47.550 --> 34:49.376
<i>Oh!</i>

35:10.190 --> 35:12.811
Where in the name of heaven
did you come from?

35:12.831 --> 35:15.369
Prison, actually. We just broke out.

35:15.391 --> 35:19.173
Well, how? Your remote transmitters
were returned to us.

35:19.150 --> 35:22.518
SG-9 and I spent the last two days
negotiating your release.

35:22.512 --> 35:24.467
With no luck, I might add.

35:24.512 --> 35:27.547
Actually, we returned via P2A-509.

35:27.552 --> 35:30.467
Daniel remembered
that SG-3 would be there, sir.

35:30.471 --> 35:34.300
Major Warren found us and lent us
a transmitter to open the iris.

35:34.271 --> 35:36.677
- And if I may ask...?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

35:36.711 --> 35:39.581
General Hammond, this is Linea.

35:40.311 --> 35:42.434
We wouldn't have gotten out without her.

35:42.472 --> 35:46.764
Then we owe you a great debt, ma'am.
Welcome to the SGC.

35:46.711 --> 35:49.117
I've never seen such a place.

35:49.152 --> 35:50.644
It seems so alien.

35:50.711 --> 35:55.206
So it was for me.
Over time it has become... home.

35:58.112 --> 36:03.021
General Hammond, with your permission,
I'd like to offer Linea quarters at the base.

36:02.952 --> 36:07.990
There's a great deal she has to teach us.
I brought back samples of her root that...

36:07.913 --> 36:10.201
I'll take that into consideration, Captain.

36:10.233 --> 36:14.726
Now I'd like you to report to the infirmary,
including your guest.

36:14.672 --> 36:18.335
- Sorry, ma'am. It's just precautionary.
- I would do the same.

36:18.313 --> 36:21.181
We'll debrief after you've all rested.

36:21.192 --> 36:23.184
Come with me.

36:23.231 --> 36:25.271
Linea,...

36:25.672 --> 36:27.710
...thank you.

36:32.193 --> 36:35.027
You spoke of a machine for storing data.

36:35.032 --> 36:37.070
Yeah. Right here.

36:40.873 --> 36:44.371
You have a way
of representing the basics?

36:44.353 --> 36:46.594
Molecules and atoms? Yes.

36:47.353 --> 36:49.393
Here, sit down.

36:50.793 --> 36:52.416
Just use this.

36:52.472 --> 36:57.465
If I give you the basic structure
of my activators, can you fabricate?

36:59.594 --> 37:04.632
That was about the time Daniel
picked a fight with this big, smelly guy.

37:04.554 --> 37:06.592
He actually won.

37:07.914 --> 37:09.740
Enter.

37:12.753 --> 37:16.204
Found him lurking near base camp, sir.
You need to hear this.

37:16.193 --> 37:18.980
General, this is the...

37:18.994 --> 37:22.159
...former blind man I was telling you about.

37:23.795 --> 37:25.751
First thing I see?

37:25.793 --> 37:28.793
- Destroyer of Worlds.
- Excuse me?

37:28.793 --> 37:32.161
She created a sickness.
The one you call Linea.

37:32.153 --> 37:34.228
She... The Destroyer.

37:37.193 --> 37:40.443
Uh, she told Carter there was a plague.

37:41.313 --> 37:42.641
She offered to help.

37:42.715 --> 37:44.753
Not help.

37:45.074 --> 37:47.114
She started it.

37:53.394 --> 37:57.141
And this Stargate system
spans thousands of worlds?

37:57.114 --> 38:01.157
Theoretically even more.
We've charted several hundred already.

38:01.115 --> 38:04.068
So far we've only visited
a fraction of them.

38:04.076 --> 38:06.945
Most worlds in the network
can sustain human life.

38:06.954 --> 38:09.789
Where's the repository of this knowledge?

38:09.795 --> 38:11.871
It's in the computers. I'll show you.

38:11.916 --> 38:14.322
I'm in your debt, Samantha.

38:14.356 --> 38:16.893
This shall not be forgotten.

38:18.554 --> 38:21.092
Our island states were at war.

38:21.115 --> 38:25.407
She created a sickness.
One she couldn't get herself.

38:25.355 --> 38:27.891
A terrible sickness.

38:27.916 --> 38:29.409
Go on.

38:32.115 --> 38:34.155
Half our people died.

38:34.436 --> 38:37.518
She came.
Promised to save the rest.

38:37.797 --> 38:40.333
By then it had spread island to island.

38:40.356 --> 38:44.398
By the time they caught her,
she had destroyed half a world.

39:13.597 --> 39:17.639
- What's going on?
- Unauthorised gate activation.

39:20.117 --> 39:23.070
Abort the countdown.
Get a team to the gate room.

39:23.076 --> 39:23.940
It's sealed.

39:24.036 --> 39:27.036
Unseal it.
Colonel, effect the manual override.

39:31.876 --> 39:34.960
- Where's Linea?
- When we came to, she was gone.

39:36.197 --> 39:38.070
Wormhole's been activated.

39:38.117 --> 39:41.282
- You were unconscious?
- Only for a few minutes.

39:41.277 --> 39:44.858
The abort command
is not responding, sir.

39:48.878 --> 39:51.367
Step away from that gate!
Shut it down.

39:51.398 --> 39:53.639
<i>Self-destruct in 30 seconds.</i>

39:55.958 --> 39:57.996
It won't take our code, sir.

39:59.197 --> 40:00.572
Close the iris!

40:00.639 --> 40:03.637
<i>Self-destruct in 20 seconds.</i>

40:03.639 --> 40:06.637
Try shutting the whole system down.

40:06.637 --> 40:10.302
We can't, sir. She got into the computer.
She got the coordinates.

40:10.277 --> 40:13.728
<i>Self-destruct in ten seconds.</i>

40:15.277 --> 40:18.858
<i>- Nine, eight, seven...
- The code's been erased.</i>

40:19.918 --> 40:21.577
This makes no sense.

40:21.639 --> 40:24.259
<i>Three, two,...</i>

40:24.277 --> 40:25.855
<i>.. one.</i>

40:28.039 --> 40:30.077
<i>Standing by.</i>

40:34.998 --> 40:37.454
Redial those coordinates.

40:37.478 --> 40:39.885
Request permission to go after her...

40:39.918 --> 40:41.376
The entire system crashed.

40:43.679 --> 40:45.172
Get it back up.

40:46.519 --> 40:47.467
Colonel?

41:01.199 --> 41:02.942
We let her out.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.454
The Destroyer of Worlds.
