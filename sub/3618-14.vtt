WEBVTT

00:03.360 --> 00:05.340
Good morning. Any phone calls?

00:05.440 --> 00:10.040
Take your pick.
You've got adulterers, cross-dressers,

00:10.400 --> 00:13.340
34-year-old virgins
and your nephew.

00:13.440 --> 00:15.180
Oh, Chris called?

00:15.280 --> 00:18.520
No, Wyatt.
Actually, I think Piper did the dialling.

00:18.840 --> 00:20.840
But you have another nephew?

00:22.040 --> 00:25.320
No, but you know,
maybe someday I will.

00:25.640 --> 00:27.640
You know what I mean? Okay.

00:30.400 --> 00:32.380
Phoebe, I need your help.

00:32.479 --> 00:34.780
I've been calling for you all week,
didn't you hear me?

00:34.880 --> 00:38.120
For the first couple of days, yeah.
Then I put you on mute.

00:38.440 --> 00:39.780
You could put me on mute?

00:39.880 --> 00:43.240
I had to. I was busy.
Now, I need your help.

00:43.840 --> 00:45.940
Oh, yeah, and I need yours too.

00:46.040 --> 00:48.460
Because you come here,
you drop this bombshell on me,

00:48.560 --> 00:50.140
and you expect
me to keep this secret?

00:50.240 --> 00:52.140
I don't even know why
I'm keeping this secret.

00:52.240 --> 00:54.420
Nobody can find out
Piper and Leo are my parents!

00:54.520 --> 00:56.180
It could mess with the whole future.

00:56.280 --> 00:58.920
If you didn't want anyone to know,
I don't know why you told me.

00:59.240 --> 01:01.780
I told you because you busted me
and I'm glad you did.

01:01.880 --> 01:03.860
I have been so focused
on protecting Wyatt,

01:03.960 --> 01:07.560
I've completely forgotten about me.
This month is my conception date.

01:08.440 --> 01:10.640
- Your conception date?
- That's where I've been.

01:11.280 --> 01:14.160
Oracles, fortune-tellers, soothsayers,
they all say the same thing.

01:14.480 --> 01:17.620
If Mom and Dad don't screw
this month, I'm screwed.

01:17.720 --> 01:21.440
Okay, I'm just trying to get used
to you being my nephew.

01:22.840 --> 01:25.760
- I never hit on you, did I?
- What? No.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.480
- Oh, thank God.
- Can we focus here, please?

01:28.800 --> 01:30.180
Mom and Dad need to have sex.

01:30.280 --> 01:32.220
Now, who's gonna tell them,
you or me?

01:32.320 --> 01:36.360
Nobody's gonna tell them because
we're not gonna reopen those wounds.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.600
Okay.

01:42.240 --> 01:46.360
- How do we get them back together?
- No. We? There's no "we" here.

01:46.760 --> 01:48.800
We don't.
You're the one that split them up.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.500
And why did you split them up?

01:51.600 --> 01:54.480
Leo had to become an Elder to make
room for me as your whitelighter.

01:55.080 --> 01:57.620
It was the only way
I could protect Wyatt from turning evil.

01:57.720 --> 01:59.180
You're unbelievable.

01:59.280 --> 02:02.920
I mean, most kids who are the cause
of their parents' divorce

02:03.320 --> 02:07.280
actually feel guilty and yet you're sitting
here like it's part of your master plan.

02:07.640 --> 02:10.699
- I'm sensing some real issues here.
- You're damn right there are issues!

02:10.800 --> 02:13.540
You can't just pop in from the future
and play with people's lives

02:13.640 --> 02:15.500
because your big brother
picked on you!

02:15.600 --> 02:18.200
- He picked on the world, Phoebe!
- I'm not finished!

02:18.520 --> 02:21.140
Your parents were happy
until you split them up.

02:21.240 --> 02:22.740
And now you want my help

02:22.840 --> 02:25.300
because you didn't think
this all the way through?

02:25.400 --> 02:26.980
- Feel better?
- Yes.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.080
- Will you help me?
- No.

02:30.520 --> 02:32.580
Oh, I don't know.

02:32.680 --> 02:35.800
If I'm not conceived in the next
couple of weeks, I'll disappear forever.

02:39.120 --> 02:42.080
You're willing to help
complete strangers.

02:42.760 --> 02:44.760
How about family?

02:46.520 --> 02:48.600
No, no, no. No, please!

02:51.720 --> 02:53.920
What is it? What'd you see?

02:55.240 --> 02:57.680
- A woman being attacked.
- Where?

03:04.400 --> 03:07.640
- Looks like a dig site.
- In the desert in the Middle East.

03:07.960 --> 03:11.560
- Are you sure your scrying wasn't off?
- Maybe Jinny is an archaeologist.

03:11.880 --> 03:14.340
Yeah, why would an archaeologist
in the Middle East

03:14.440 --> 03:17.200
send a letter to an advice columnist
in San Francisco?

03:17.520 --> 03:19.580
She said she was with
a controlling man.

03:19.680 --> 03:22.880
Okay, you're missing my point.
What happens if this is a trap?

03:24.480 --> 03:26.480
What is that?

03:31.280 --> 03:33.400
You think anyone heard them?

03:40.440 --> 03:42.440
No!

03:50.320 --> 03:53.220
- You okay?
- I'll be fine. Was that a flying carpet?

03:53.320 --> 03:55.400
What is that?

04:02.120 --> 04:04.520
Thank you for responding
to my letter.

04:05.280 --> 04:07.380
Wait. Are you Jinny?

04:07.480 --> 04:10.120
At your service, master.

05:42.360 --> 05:46.240
I could heal him, master.
Your warrior needs his strength.

05:46.560 --> 05:49.100
My last master
will be coming back for me.

05:49.200 --> 05:53.160
- I think he's got it under control.
- Good idea. Save your wishes.

05:53.960 --> 05:55.860
- You get a good look at the demon?
- I did.

05:55.960 --> 05:58.580
<i>When we're done, I'll go to the</i>
<i>Book of Shadows to check it out.</i>

05:58.680 --> 06:01.800
I also called Paige to see if she'd
keep an eye on Jinny for me.

06:02.480 --> 06:04.480
- Thanks.
- There is no need to guard me.

06:04.800 --> 06:07.220
Even if I was not bound to serve you,
I would do it anyway,

06:07.320 --> 06:09.220
for sparing me from Bosk.

06:09.320 --> 06:11.220
- Bosk?
- My last master.

06:11.320 --> 06:14.520
He's cruel, even for a demon.
And I would know.

06:14.880 --> 06:18.080
My bottle has been passed around
from demon to demon for centuries.

06:18.440 --> 06:21.100
- That's terrible.
- You cannot begin to know.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.860
That is why I got the message
to Phoebe.

06:23.960 --> 06:26.480
I knew if she had my bottle,
she would wish me free.

06:27.080 --> 06:29.940
No wishes. I know all about genies.

06:30.040 --> 06:32.500
- You're tricksters.
- Listen, I gotta get back up there.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.780
You think you can handle this
without Piper?

06:34.880 --> 06:37.140
- Where is Piper?
- On a date.

06:37.240 --> 06:40.120
- On a date in the middle of the day?
- Yeah, Greg works nights.

06:40.440 --> 06:42.640
Greg, Greg.

06:43.400 --> 06:47.640
Greg the fireman? You mean the one
she's insanely sexually attracted to?

06:49.000 --> 06:50.540
- Doesn't that bother you?
- No.

06:50.640 --> 06:53.360
- If she's happy, that's all that matters.
- Oh, come on!

06:53.720 --> 06:56.780
What about all this forbidden lovers,
you and me against the world stuff?

06:56.880 --> 06:58.780
That just doesn't go away.

06:58.880 --> 07:01.100
You know, Chris,
it's a little late for male bonding,

07:01.200 --> 07:04.320
especially since I'm petitioning
the other Elders to send you back.

07:04.920 --> 07:06.780
- What?
- Wait, are you serious?

07:06.880 --> 07:08.940
You look tense, master. Neck rub?

07:09.040 --> 07:11.020
Even though Chris' intentions
are good,

07:11.120 --> 07:14.400
his methods have put us all at risk.
So he's going back.

07:14.760 --> 07:16.260
You mean abandoning me again.

07:16.360 --> 07:18.700
You did your job.
You warned us of an evil after Wyatt.

07:18.800 --> 07:20.800
I think we can handle it from here.

07:23.160 --> 07:25.500
- I gotta stop him.
- Don't worry, I'll talk to Leo.

07:25.600 --> 07:29.840
No, no, not Leo. Greg, the fireman.
He's about to sleep with my mom.

07:30.240 --> 07:32.240
I really wish you wouldn't do that.

07:34.760 --> 07:38.800
- What just happened?
- Your wish is my command, master.

07:39.160 --> 07:41.400
All right, where's the genie?

07:43.080 --> 07:45.080
Oh, my God, you landed one.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.980
She's a genie, not a trout.

07:47.080 --> 07:50.360
You still have two wishes, master.
I suggest you save one for Bosk.

07:50.680 --> 07:51.940
I told you, no wishes.

07:52.040 --> 07:54.500
- We're gonna do this our way.
- But you cannot handle him.

07:54.600 --> 07:58.280
Nobody can. He has a flying carpet
and an army of 40 thieves.

07:58.600 --> 07:59.980
Thirty-eight, I vanquished two.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.820
Let me guess.
He wanted a crew and a nice ride.

08:02.920 --> 08:06.520
- Original for a demon's wish, huh?
- Yes, and if Bosk gets me back,

08:06.840 --> 08:08.840
he will force me to grant
his third wish.

08:09.160 --> 08:11.160
What's his third wish?

08:12.280 --> 08:14.380
- Did you do that?
- No, but they are lovely.

08:14.480 --> 08:16.340
Who conjured them for you?

08:16.440 --> 08:19.200
My boyfriend, Richard. He's been
showering me with gifts all week.

08:19.520 --> 08:21.600
Didn't you talk to him
about binding his powers?

08:21.920 --> 08:25.360
I have! But every time I bring it up,
I just get another present.

08:25.680 --> 08:28.320
- Luxury problem I know, but still...
- Yeah, not good.

08:28.640 --> 08:31.140
Back to the demon.
What was his third wish?

08:31.240 --> 08:33.600
- Zanbar.
- Zanbar.

08:33.919 --> 08:36.500
- What's Zanbar?
- The lost city.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.500
Before being swallowed up
by the desert,

08:38.600 --> 08:41.679
it was the seat of power
for an evil empire.

08:42.240 --> 08:45.520
Phoebe, will you do something,
please? I can't orb.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.380
Damn him.

08:49.480 --> 08:51.720
If he won't listen to you,
maybe he'll listen to family.

08:52.040 --> 08:54.060
Most of them are dead, remember?
The feud?

08:54.160 --> 08:56.020
Please, we do not
have time for this!

08:56.120 --> 08:59.800
If Bosk captures me,
Zanbar will rise again from the dust.

09:00.400 --> 09:01.860
It's just a city.

09:01.960 --> 09:04.020
A city of magic.

09:04.120 --> 09:07.340
Bosk has been using his thieves
to search for its former site.

09:07.440 --> 09:11.520
If he finds it and wishes it back,
there will be no stopping him.

09:11.880 --> 09:14.220
That is why you must
wish me free, master.

09:14.320 --> 09:18.920
If I am not a genie, it will solve
your problems and mine. I beg you.

09:19.360 --> 09:21.800
Hey, a little help here, please?

09:27.320 --> 09:29.260
Okay, I'm losing my mind.

09:29.360 --> 09:32.140
Paige, go to Richard,
deal with it so you can help us.

09:32.240 --> 09:34.240
Okay.

09:35.520 --> 09:37.900
You, I will help you get
your parents back together,

09:38.000 --> 09:40.420
but it has to be
on my terms, agreed?

09:40.520 --> 09:43.560
- Agreed.
- Go get Piper. We could use her help.

09:44.480 --> 09:46.480
I wish that he could orb.

09:50.400 --> 09:52.740
And we need to find
a vanquishing potion for that demon.

09:52.840 --> 09:54.700
- Yes, master.
- Phoebe!

09:54.800 --> 09:56.920
Yes, master, Phoebe.

10:05.800 --> 10:08.620
Piper! Piper!

10:08.720 --> 10:10.580
Forget it.

10:10.680 --> 10:14.040
I know you're in there.
Please, open the door now.

10:14.800 --> 10:16.300
Just a second.

10:16.400 --> 10:19.920
Piper, open the door. Piper!

10:21.240 --> 10:23.600
- Go away.
- We have an emergency.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.980
- Is there a problem here?
- Yeah, many problems, many levels.

10:27.080 --> 10:29.080
Piper has to come home now.

10:29.840 --> 10:32.960
- Excuse me? Who are you again?
- I'm a friend of her husband's.

10:34.120 --> 10:37.480
Ex-husband.
And he's not really a great friend.

10:38.880 --> 10:40.880
It's okay, I got it.

10:41.280 --> 10:43.280
I'm here if you need me.

10:49.800 --> 10:53.040
What is this big emergency?
Can it wait an hour or two?

10:53.360 --> 10:56.100
No, it can't. There's a demon
on the loose, a genie running amuck

10:56.200 --> 10:57.820
and it took me two wishes
to get here.

10:57.920 --> 10:59.500
You can't make wishes
with genies.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.540
See, we need you.
Come on, let's orb.

11:01.640 --> 11:03.660
No, no, no! Listen.

11:03.760 --> 11:06.740
I am not gonna leave him high and dry
again without an explanation.

11:06.840 --> 11:09.280
So your demon
can wait five minutes.

11:15.720 --> 11:17.720
Open sesame!

11:23.760 --> 11:25.580
- What happened?
- The genie was stolen,

11:25.680 --> 11:26.820
thanks to your warriors.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.460
But they were
my two best swordsmen.

11:28.560 --> 11:31.340
Well, swords don't work real well
against potions.

11:31.440 --> 11:34.060
What the hell are witches doing
way out here?

11:34.160 --> 11:36.960
We have defences
against their type.

11:41.520 --> 11:46.440
The Eye of Aghbar.
It protects against witches' magic.

11:48.160 --> 11:50.360
I need that genie.

11:51.600 --> 11:54.800
All this work for nothing
if we don't get her back!

11:55.160 --> 11:58.060
I'll gather my warriors,
all my warriors.

11:58.160 --> 12:01.560
No. No, you and your men,
you keep digging.

12:01.880 --> 12:05.720
I've got to find out where Zanbar
is buried before I wish for its return.

12:06.040 --> 12:08.200
I can't risk another demon
beating me to the throne.

12:09.640 --> 12:11.640
As you wish.

12:15.480 --> 12:17.480
Richard?

12:18.360 --> 12:20.360
Richard.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.380
You like your earrings?

12:25.480 --> 12:28.420
Oh, you're materializing now.

12:28.520 --> 12:30.940
Yeah, pretty handy, huh?

12:31.040 --> 12:33.620
So you like your earrings?

12:33.720 --> 12:36.300
Yeah, there's a bit of a problem.

12:36.400 --> 12:41.160
They're too small. No, they're too big.
I can shrink them. Let's see...

12:41.520 --> 12:47.360
No, that's not the problem. I just...
You've given me enough.

12:47.840 --> 12:50.720
I'm just trying to make you happy.
I want you to know that I care.

12:51.040 --> 12:54.480
What would make me really happy is
if you just stopped with all the potions

12:54.800 --> 12:57.000
and all the magic, just for a while.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.940
- Didn't we have this conversation?
- Yeah.

13:00.040 --> 13:02.500
- But only one of us was listening.
- No, I was listening.

13:02.600 --> 13:05.400
I mean, that's why I'm doing this,
to prove that I can handle it.

13:06.080 --> 13:09.080
- I'm not becoming a dark beast, right?
- But that's not the point.

13:09.400 --> 13:12.900
Most women
would thank a guy for that,

13:13.000 --> 13:15.140
but you're treating me
like a common criminal.

13:15.240 --> 13:17.240
Well, I guess I'm not most women.

13:20.560 --> 13:23.320
I gotta go.
Hope you like the earrings.

13:29.400 --> 13:35.600
Oh, he was my master once.
And him too. And her.

13:36.040 --> 13:38.220
Boy, you sure got around.

13:38.320 --> 13:41.200
How did so many demons
get ahold of you, anyway?

13:41.520 --> 13:43.940
Some bought, some stole.

13:44.040 --> 13:47.560
I changed hands so many times,
I lost track.

13:50.160 --> 13:54.960
I'm sorry I can't set you free.
But wishing is just too risky right now.

13:59.520 --> 14:02.320
Okay, let's go.
Greg's not gonna wait forever.

14:02.640 --> 14:05.180
- Then you should dump him.
- What is that supposed to mean?

14:05.280 --> 14:07.640
He's just being overprotective.

14:07.960 --> 14:10.680
I take it you're the genie.

14:11.040 --> 14:12.860
- Jinny.
- Jinny the genie.

14:12.960 --> 14:15.880
Of course. Who's the demon?

14:21.160 --> 14:23.160
He's a low-level demon
with minimal powers.

14:24.680 --> 14:27.200
- There's a vanquishing potion.
- That's what I'm working on.

14:27.760 --> 14:30.420
Good. Then you're almost done
with me too.

14:30.520 --> 14:32.940
Okay, so, what's your plan,
gonna summon him to us?

14:33.040 --> 14:35.160
- Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
- What's the rush?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.980
Well, not that it's any
of your business,

14:38.080 --> 14:42.400
but Greg's shift starts in a few hours
and I won't see him for three days.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.580
So I'm gonna go call him

14:44.680 --> 14:49.240
and I'd put the genie back in the bottle,
just to be safe, no offence.

14:49.640 --> 14:51.640
But we've been burned before.

14:54.120 --> 14:57.200
- Do you mind?
- Yes, master.

15:00.840 --> 15:02.740
I feel so bad.

15:02.840 --> 15:05.140
As well you should.
If we don't do something soon,

15:05.240 --> 15:07.760
I could end up half fireman
instead of half whitelighter.

15:08.080 --> 15:11.060
- Oh, for goodness sake.
- Look, I'm running out of time here.

15:11.160 --> 15:15.000
So, what do you say we use that genie
to make Mom and Dad, you know...

15:15.920 --> 15:18.120
That's vile and against the rules.

15:18.440 --> 15:20.640
I think that you wouldn't want
to be conceived that way.

15:20.960 --> 15:23.780
- It beats not being conceived at all.
- I told you I would help you

15:23.880 --> 15:27.480
on my terms, okay? So back off.

15:27.840 --> 15:30.720
- What are your terms?
- I'm not really sure yet.

15:31.080 --> 15:33.180
But I am done with this potion.

15:33.280 --> 15:36.000
As soon as Piper gets back,
we are ready to go.

15:43.800 --> 15:45.940
Not this time, witch!

15:46.040 --> 15:49.320
Piper! Jinny, I wish you free.

15:53.200 --> 15:56.520
Well, it's about time.
Who's the master now?

16:01.920 --> 16:03.920
Chris!

16:12.000 --> 16:16.760
- Where's Phoebe?
- Here! In here!

16:20.720 --> 16:23.080
Hello, master.

16:27.040 --> 16:30.920
- Will you come out of there, please?
- I can't, I don't know how!

16:31.280 --> 16:33.280
Try commanding me.

16:33.880 --> 16:36.520
Okay. Get the hell out of there.

16:36.840 --> 16:39.840
No, not you. My master.

16:48.160 --> 16:49.820
- You mean me?
- Well, yeah.

16:49.920 --> 16:53.240
- You picked up the bottle, didn't you?
- All right, get out of the bottle.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.600
I command you.

17:00.400 --> 17:04.680
- You look ridiculous.
- I feel ridiculous.

17:05.040 --> 17:08.420
Well, how am I supposed to get back
to Greg now with this?

17:08.520 --> 17:10.220
Is that all you care about?
Look at me.

17:10.319 --> 17:14.400
I am trapped in pantaloons right now.
Where is the mirr...?

17:14.960 --> 17:17.500
Oh, and why do I always
get stuck with the wig?

17:17.599 --> 17:20.160
Trust me, you don't. Leo!

17:20.520 --> 17:23.800
Have you noticed that Leo is the first
person you call in your time of need?

17:27.359 --> 17:29.180
Yeah, right.

17:29.280 --> 17:31.820
I still can't believe
you made a wish with a genie.

17:31.920 --> 17:34.500
- You know better than that.
- I thought she was an innocent.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.840
How was I to know
that I was gonna unleash a demon?

17:37.960 --> 17:40.740
- It says so right here.
- Oh, right. Right there, in Arabic.

17:40.840 --> 17:43.180
There's a warning label
on the genie bottle?

17:43.280 --> 17:46.280
Yeah, an ancient sorcerer
condemned a demon into the bottle

17:46.600 --> 17:47.700
for not marrying him.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.680
It says whoever tried to free her,
they'd have to switch places with her.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.140
- Missed a big one here, bud.
- You wanna pin this on me?

17:54.240 --> 17:56.420
Leo, it's not his fault. It's my fault.

17:56.520 --> 17:59.960
How come your empathy thing
didn't give her away?

18:00.280 --> 18:02.360
<i>She tricked me</i>
<i>and obviously the Book too.</i>

18:02.680 --> 18:04.420
Let's figure out a way to fix this.

18:04.520 --> 18:07.200
Well, the only way to fix it is to get
the demon to wish Phoebe free.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.720
- Reverse the magic.
- That's what we need to do then.

18:10.040 --> 18:11.340
I'll call Paige.

18:11.440 --> 18:15.240
Yes, I do believe the element
of surprise is very important here.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.740
Are you sure?
We can always take our time with this.

18:17.840 --> 18:20.000
You know, keep Piper around
just a little bit longer?

18:20.320 --> 18:23.280
- Yes, master.
- Good. I'm glad you agree.

18:23.600 --> 18:26.780
Actually, I don't agree, but I can't...

18:26.880 --> 18:29.520
How am I supposed to take charge
and take commands at the same time?

18:29.840 --> 18:32.020
You won't have to.
Chris is coming up there with me.

18:32.120 --> 18:34.680
- The Elders agreed to send him back.
- What?

18:35.000 --> 18:36.580
You don't know
what you're doing, Leo.

18:36.680 --> 18:37.820
You don't belong here.

18:37.920 --> 18:40.200
And as your whitelighter,
he's doing more harm than good.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.020
You are so full of it!

18:42.120 --> 18:44.100
This isn't about me
being a bad whitelighter.

18:44.200 --> 18:46.280
It's about you feeling
like I've let you down somehow!

18:46.600 --> 18:48.540
So whatever issues
you might have with me,

18:48.640 --> 18:51.120
I wish you would
just get over it already!

18:57.400 --> 18:59.540
Leo?

18:59.640 --> 19:01.900
Of course I forgive you, man.
You don't have to yell.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.860
- All you gotta do is ask.
- I did?

19:03.960 --> 19:07.280
Yeah. And listen, with that whole
going back to the future thing,

19:07.640 --> 19:09.180
you know, don't worry about it,

19:09.280 --> 19:11.540
because I'll talk to the Elders
and we'll work it out.

19:11.640 --> 19:14.520
It's no big deal, okay?
Come give me a hug.

19:18.560 --> 19:20.500
What do you mean
she didn't read the warning?

19:20.600 --> 19:23.460
<i>I'll explain later. The bottom line</i>
<i>is we need you home now.</i>

19:23.560 --> 19:27.280
Well, I can't. I'm kind of in the middle
of saving Richard right now.

19:27.640 --> 19:28.900
Be right with you.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.360
I took Phoebe's advice,
I got his family here.

19:31.680 --> 19:34.800
- Aren't most of his relatives dead?
- They are.

19:35.320 --> 19:38.100
You're holding a magical intervention
with ghosts?

19:38.200 --> 19:39.580
<i>Well, I thought about it</i>

19:39.680 --> 19:41.940
and I realized
that one of Richard's problems

19:42.040 --> 19:45.360
is that he's got no family here.
He's got no support system.

19:45.680 --> 19:48.120
So the burden of helping him
has kind of fallen on me.

19:48.440 --> 19:51.580
Okay, fine. Hey, maybe since
you have all those ghosts there,

19:51.680 --> 19:53.740
you can get one to help us out
when you're done.

19:53.840 --> 19:56.000
Help us do what?

20:02.080 --> 20:05.600
- What's going on here?
- I'll call you back.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.200
What are they doing here?

20:08.800 --> 20:11.520
Your family is here
because they care about you.

20:11.840 --> 20:13.980
They've seen what happens to you
when you use magic,

20:14.080 --> 20:16.520
and they don't want it
to happen again.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.140
You summoned them?

20:18.240 --> 20:20.240
We're here
because we want to be here.

20:21.040 --> 20:23.180
We need you to listen to us.

20:23.280 --> 20:26.040
This is crazy.
This is an intervention, right?

20:26.360 --> 20:28.800
- Look, I'm out of here.
- Richard, wait!

20:29.120 --> 20:30.980
After everything,
this is how you thank me,

20:31.080 --> 20:32.820
by embarrassing me
in front of my family?

20:32.920 --> 20:35.840
Look, if you keep doing this,
something bad is gonna happen.

20:36.160 --> 20:38.620
Something terrible, I can feel it.

20:38.720 --> 20:41.920
She's right, Richard.
Our family...

20:42.240 --> 20:45.140
I died because of the magic.
You can't let yourself end up like that.

20:45.240 --> 20:47.240
I can make you
a power-stripping potion.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.880
It'll turn you back into yourself.

20:50.920 --> 20:52.920
Just let me help you.

20:57.800 --> 20:59.800
What do we do now?

21:04.120 --> 21:07.200
Anyone else have a problem
taking orders from an ex-genie?

21:08.600 --> 21:12.040
We are at your service, my queen.

21:14.480 --> 21:17.640
Queen. I like the sound of that.

21:17.960 --> 21:20.700
Every queen deserves an empire.

21:20.800 --> 21:22.880
Have you found the location
of the lost city yet?

21:23.200 --> 21:25.200
We believe
we've discovered the site.

21:26.280 --> 21:29.560
Very good.
Now all I need is that bottle.

21:30.160 --> 21:34.640
Gather your best fighters.
We're going on a witch hunt.

21:45.400 --> 21:47.420
Hey, Piper says to hurry up
with those crystals.

21:47.520 --> 21:50.280
Genie Phoebe is getting
on her last nerves down there.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.900
- What are you doing?
- I'm writing you an apology.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.600
I just... I can't seem to get it right.

21:56.360 --> 21:58.380
Leo, come on, man,
you don't need to do that.

21:58.480 --> 22:01.220
I know that I don't need to,
but I want to.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.620
It feels good to forgive.

22:02.720 --> 22:05.220
Yeah, why don't you just hold on
to that feeling, okay?

22:05.320 --> 22:07.420
- We gotta help the sisters.
- Well, in a minute.

22:07.520 --> 22:11.600
This is just as important.
"Dear Chris, l..."

22:11.960 --> 22:13.700
All right, all right, enough already.

22:13.800 --> 22:16.040
You said you're sorry,
let's just not go overboard.

22:16.360 --> 22:19.140
But after everything I've put
you through, I feel I owe it to you.

22:19.240 --> 22:21.660
Honestly, a letter's not gonna mean
a hell of a lot to me.

22:21.760 --> 22:24.240
- I got plenty of them growing up.
- Sorry?

22:26.880 --> 22:29.520
From my father.
He wasn't around much.

22:30.240 --> 22:32.240
That's awful.

22:33.120 --> 22:34.740
- You wanna talk about it?
- No.

22:34.840 --> 22:36.780
What I want from you
is to grab the crystals

22:36.880 --> 22:39.820
and go downstairs to where Piper is.
Do you remember her?

22:39.920 --> 22:42.040
Sure. But right now
I'm more concerned about you.

22:42.360 --> 22:44.700
- You seem stressed.
- You're damn right I'm stressed.

22:44.800 --> 22:47.640
I'm concerned about you two.
You need to get back together already.

22:47.960 --> 22:50.100
- Any chance that'll happen?
- I don't think so.

22:50.200 --> 22:52.380
But thanks for caring, man.
It means a lot.

22:52.480 --> 22:54.480
Wait.

22:56.160 --> 22:58.440
You still love her. I know you do.

22:58.760 --> 23:00.860
How could you just
throw that away?

23:00.960 --> 23:03.680
- It's a little personal, don't you think?
- More than you know.

23:04.440 --> 23:07.060
Look, are you telling me
that there is no chance

23:07.160 --> 23:09.480
that you and Piper
are gonna hook up in, let's say,

23:09.800 --> 23:11.940
I don't know,
the next couple of weeks?

23:12.040 --> 23:14.680
Actually, yeah, that's what I'm saying.
We've both moved on.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.560
And nothing short of a miracle
could make that happen.

23:23.760 --> 23:27.360
The wording is not quite right there.
Jinny is an upper-level demon.

23:27.680 --> 23:29.740
Hey, I don't need a bossy genie
on my back.

23:29.840 --> 23:32.820
I'm giving up a lot to be here.
I'll write the vanquishing spell my way.

23:32.920 --> 23:35.860
- You should invoke the name of...
- Should I call Chris to shut you up?

23:35.960 --> 23:38.440
- You wouldn't!
- Keep pushing me.

23:41.720 --> 23:43.100
- Back so soon?
- Yeah.

23:43.200 --> 23:46.020
The intervention
was a complete train wreck.

23:46.120 --> 23:49.280
- Richard wouldn't listen to anyone.
- Oh, Paige, I'm so sorry.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.460
You're laughing at me?

23:53.560 --> 23:55.800
I'm trying to be sympathetic,
and you're laughing at me.

23:56.120 --> 24:00.840
I'm sorry. Maybe I needed a laugh
after what I just went through.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.400
Yeah, it's okay.
Is there anything I can do?

24:03.720 --> 24:08.160
Yeah, but don't you need
to go help Major Nelson?

24:10.880 --> 24:12.020
What?

24:12.120 --> 24:15.000
- It's funny. This is kind of funny.
- Let's just finish the spell, okay?

24:15.320 --> 24:17.860
All right. Hey, I want this done
just as badly as you do.

24:17.960 --> 24:21.120
- Did you find us a ghost?
- Yeah, I got us Richard's dad.

24:21.440 --> 24:24.640
He's hanging out in limbo waiting
for my call. Why do we need a ghost?

24:25.000 --> 24:26.220
Well, once we capture Jinny,

24:26.320 --> 24:29.040
he can possess her
and force her to wish Phoebe free.

24:32.200 --> 24:34.200
Here's the crystals you wanted.

24:36.280 --> 24:37.980
Well, you guys sure are chummy.

24:38.080 --> 24:41.120
Yeah, I had a change of heart.
Decided to let bygones be bygones.

24:41.440 --> 24:43.220
Really?

24:43.320 --> 24:46.200
- There's something I have to tell you.
- After we talk in the kitchen.

24:46.520 --> 24:48.520
- But...
- Phoebe.

24:52.600 --> 24:53.860
Now, that was cool.

24:53.960 --> 24:57.040
Excuse me, I'm gonna have
a little one-on-one with the help.

24:59.640 --> 25:01.640
What's he hiding now?

25:02.920 --> 25:04.920
I'll get it.

25:05.480 --> 25:08.300
You know, Chris is a hell of a guy.

25:08.400 --> 25:11.160
You two should really give him
a chance once in awhile.

25:13.640 --> 25:17.160
- Hey.
- Richard. What are you doing here?

25:17.760 --> 25:19.960
I came to apologize.

25:23.240 --> 25:25.980
You wanna make them do what?

25:26.080 --> 25:27.700
We finally got Dad in a good mood.

25:27.800 --> 25:29.940
And Mom,
she's all sexed up for the fireman.

25:30.040 --> 25:32.100
It's the perfect time
to hit them with the whammy.

25:32.200 --> 25:35.320
No, we are not gonna make
Piper and Leo sleep together, okay?

25:35.640 --> 25:37.940
- We're gonna do this my way, mister.
- Master.

25:38.040 --> 25:40.480
- Oh, you know what? Listen to me...
- I'm sorry, Phoebe.

25:40.800 --> 25:42.800
I'm running out of time here.
A guy's gotta survive.

25:44.320 --> 25:46.760
I wish for Piper and Leo
to sleep together tonight.

25:47.080 --> 25:49.080
I'm not...

25:51.800 --> 25:53.800
What was that?

25:59.400 --> 26:01.400
Oh, no.

26:02.560 --> 26:05.040
They're sleeping. You tricked me.

26:05.360 --> 26:07.940
No, you made me wish
for them to sleep together.

26:08.040 --> 26:09.740
And they're sleeping together.

26:09.840 --> 26:12.940
This is a mess! I've only got
one more wish to sort this thing out,

26:13.040 --> 26:14.260
so if you don't mind...

26:14.360 --> 26:17.120
Oh, no, actually, I do mind, because
Jinny could be here at any moment.

26:17.440 --> 26:19.420
You know what,
I'll summon you when she does.

26:19.520 --> 26:21.580
I command you back into the bottle.

26:21.680 --> 26:23.680
When I get out of this...

26:29.560 --> 26:31.860
You're gonna break up with me
over some flowers?

26:31.960 --> 26:33.820
Look, I'm sorry. It's me or magic.

26:33.920 --> 26:36.680
- You just have to choose one.
- You can't give me that kind of choice.

26:37.040 --> 26:39.100
- I just did.
- You wanna talk about dependencies?

26:39.200 --> 26:41.200
Why are you always running off
with your sisters?

26:44.520 --> 26:46.520
Wait here.

26:53.040 --> 26:55.040
Find the bottle. Phoebe's inside.

27:03.160 --> 27:05.160
Sword!

27:23.960 --> 27:25.780
Crystals!

27:25.880 --> 27:27.880
Circle!

27:28.400 --> 27:30.400
Got her.

27:33.960 --> 27:35.960
Where's the bottle?

27:39.160 --> 27:41.160
Richard.

27:48.520 --> 27:51.280
You think these crystals
can hold me?

27:52.480 --> 27:55.820
Nope, not for long. That's why
we're putting you back in your bottle.

27:55.920 --> 27:58.880
When I form my empire, the first thing
I'll do is rid the world of witches.

27:59.200 --> 28:00.820
Well, when you're back
in your bottle,

28:00.920 --> 28:03.680
the first thing I'm gonna do
is put you in the microwave.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
How do you like that?

28:15.160 --> 28:17.600
Think she can scare me.

28:19.040 --> 28:22.360
They're still asleep?
Have you tried smelling salts?

28:22.680 --> 28:25.040
It won't work. Trust me.

28:25.360 --> 28:27.960
- What's wrong with them?
- It's a long story.

28:28.280 --> 28:30.900
I don't know, why don't you give me
the Cliff Notes version?

28:31.000 --> 28:33.940
Come on, Chris. You and Leo
and Phoebe have all been acting weird

28:34.040 --> 28:35.860
since before the demon attacked.

28:35.960 --> 28:39.960
- What's going on?
- All right. I made a little wish.

28:40.360 --> 28:43.660
- You did what?
- Two little wishes.

28:43.760 --> 28:45.820
It's not bad enough
I have to worry about Richard,

28:45.920 --> 28:48.680
now I have to worry about you too.
What did you wish for?

28:49.040 --> 28:52.040
For Leo to forgive me, which,
by the way, was an accident.

28:52.400 --> 28:55.160
- And?
- For Piper and Leo to sleep together.

28:57.160 --> 28:58.300
You...

28:58.400 --> 29:02.080
Oh, my God, you are sick! What is
wrong with you? You're disgusting.

29:02.440 --> 29:05.260
You are some creepy registered
sex offender from the future.

29:05.360 --> 29:08.100
- No, no, no. I'm Piper and Leo's son.
- My God, you're so gross!

29:08.200 --> 29:09.940
What?

29:10.040 --> 29:13.880
They're my parents.
I came back to save my family.

29:14.840 --> 29:18.880
- You're serious?
- Yeah. Only now I gotta save myself.

29:19.240 --> 29:22.720
If my mom doesn't get pregnant
in the next month, there is no me.

29:23.800 --> 29:26.220
This is all so wrong.

29:26.320 --> 29:30.680
And this has been such a long day.

29:31.360 --> 29:35.080
Look, I'm gonna orb over to Richard's,
okay? And grab the bottle.

29:35.440 --> 29:39.080
No, you can't. He's...
He's crazy right now.

29:39.440 --> 29:40.540
He might hurt you, okay?

29:40.640 --> 29:43.220
I need to strip him of his powers.
It's a whole thing.

29:43.320 --> 29:46.300
- Well, how is that gonna help?
- Well, he's been corrupted by magic,

29:46.400 --> 29:51.000
and if I don't strip him of his powers,
I might not be able to save him.

29:51.960 --> 29:56.680
- Who else knows about this?
- About me? Just Phoebe.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.480
All right, you watch Jinny.
I'm gonna go make this potion, okay?

30:00.800 --> 30:02.800
Okay.

30:11.560 --> 30:13.560
Come on. Come on!

30:30.440 --> 30:33.720
Oh, thank God.
I thought a demon got me.

30:34.040 --> 30:36.900
- Why didn't you let me out?
- I'm not ready for you yet.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.800
Hey, we're in the black magic vault.

30:40.720 --> 30:43.900
Is there a phone around? Because I'd
love to call Paige and just check in.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.640
No, you're not. I know I got a book
of wishes around here somewhere.

30:47.960 --> 30:50.780
- Wishes?
- Yeah. Gotta get the wording right.

30:50.880 --> 30:53.580
Yeah, maybe you should
just wish for sleep,

30:53.680 --> 30:55.340
because I'm really good at that wish.

30:55.440 --> 30:57.780
Look, I just want Paige
to accept me the way I am,

30:57.880 --> 31:00.140
with magic,
it's the only way it will work.

31:00.240 --> 31:02.340
I don't think magic is the answer
to your problems.

31:02.440 --> 31:05.660
- It's the cause of your problems.
- She got you brainwashed too?

31:05.760 --> 31:08.560
I'm gonna have to cast
a spell on the entire family.

31:10.280 --> 31:12.280
Here it is.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.780
Paige, I told you,
don't orb in and surprise me.

31:16.880 --> 31:18.060
He's not himself right now.

31:18.160 --> 31:20.480
How come you didn't tell me
Chris was my nephew?

31:20.800 --> 31:22.340
Maybe we could talk
about that later

31:22.440 --> 31:26.000
- because your boyfriend's about to:
- Look, I'm fine, all right.

31:26.360 --> 31:28.760
Just need to do some reading.
Call you when I'm ready.

31:29.440 --> 31:31.520
This is for your own good.

31:34.640 --> 31:36.640
Paige!

31:45.680 --> 31:47.340
Aren't you supposed to be at work?

31:47.440 --> 31:49.660
I'm on a break.
Came to surprise Piper.

31:49.760 --> 31:52.040
Oh, a little booty call, huh?

31:53.080 --> 31:56.080
- Is she here?
- No, sorry. She's sleeping.

31:57.160 --> 31:59.160
Wait. I don't believe you.

31:59.960 --> 32:01.960
Okay, see for yourself.

32:16.160 --> 32:18.320
You want me to tell them
you stopped by?

32:20.080 --> 32:22.640
No, that... That won't be necessary.

32:38.720 --> 32:40.920
Sorry, Mom. It's for the best.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Take me to the bottle.

32:54.400 --> 32:57.600
Are you okay?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

32:57.920 --> 33:01.360
- It's okay. It's fine.
- I'll make it up to you.

33:01.720 --> 33:03.580
No, no, no. Not that way.

33:03.680 --> 33:05.020
No more wishes.

33:05.120 --> 33:09.560
No, no, it's okay. It's not for me.
Phoebe, I wish you free.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.560
What is this?

33:18.760 --> 33:20.760
What are you doing here?

33:31.640 --> 33:33.640
Genie, I wish
the Charmed Ones dead!

33:37.920 --> 33:39.920
No!

33:43.200 --> 33:45.200
Now, into the bottle!

33:50.520 --> 33:52.520
My condolences.

33:58.960 --> 34:02.720
No, you can't be dead yet.
It's not your time.

34:03.080 --> 34:05.440
I know it's not your time.

34:09.480 --> 34:12.800
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
This is all my fault.

34:13.760 --> 34:16.040
She was gonna kill Mom and Dad.

34:22.320 --> 34:24.320
Oh, no!

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Leo, wake up.

34:31.280 --> 34:33.280
But how...?

34:45.040 --> 34:48.920
Hey, Chris, we're not moving on.

34:49.280 --> 34:52.000
- Why aren't we moving on?
- Who cares? You're still here.

34:52.320 --> 34:54.100
- Got any unfinished business?
- No. You?

34:54.199 --> 34:56.620
Now that you mention it,
it would've been nice to find out

34:56.719 --> 34:59.020
I had another nephew before I died!

34:59.120 --> 35:02.180
I was gonna tell you,
but I just didn't get a chance.

35:02.280 --> 35:04.140
We can fix this.
We can reverse the magic.

35:04.240 --> 35:06.240
All we need to do is get the bottle.

35:06.800 --> 35:09.700
That's true, we're ghosts. We can
possess Jinny. Where is Jinny?

35:09.800 --> 35:12.940
Well, she was planning
to conjure the lost city.

35:13.040 --> 35:15.340
Don't worry,
we're gonna take care of this.

35:15.440 --> 35:18.280
- Should we go check on Piper first?
- No, no, no. Piper's fine.

35:18.600 --> 35:21.520
I mean, she has to be, right? If she
was dead, I would have vanished.

35:22.480 --> 35:25.240
- How do we reach Jinny?
- You can haunt anybody you want.

35:25.560 --> 35:28.960
You should just concentrate
and it should wisp you right to her.

35:32.560 --> 35:34.560
Wait for me!

35:36.480 --> 35:38.680
You're sure this is the site?

35:40.240 --> 35:44.320
One of the hounds of the Zanbar.
They guarded the city for the sultan.

35:44.680 --> 35:47.500
I could use a few of those myself.

35:47.600 --> 35:49.680
You ready in there?

35:50.840 --> 35:54.640
I wish to resurrect
the lost city of Zanbar!

36:16.080 --> 36:18.420
Finders keepers.

36:18.520 --> 36:20.920
I wouldn't unpack just now
if I were you.

36:25.280 --> 36:27.920
Why haven't you moved on?
You're dead!

36:28.240 --> 36:30.240
So are you.

36:35.520 --> 36:38.000
- Watch out!
- Phoebe, a little help here?

36:39.440 --> 36:41.440
I think I've got control of her body.

36:47.360 --> 36:49.360
Okay, all clear.

36:51.640 --> 36:53.640
Richard, I wish you free!

36:57.800 --> 36:59.800
No!

37:01.720 --> 37:03.620
Hi, honey.

37:03.720 --> 37:05.720
Let me out of here!

37:06.360 --> 37:08.360
I wish the Charmed Ones
alive again.

37:08.960 --> 37:11.960
Yes, master.

37:21.240 --> 37:23.240
You okay?

37:24.040 --> 37:26.560
Take this, get it out of my sight.

37:27.200 --> 37:30.520
Sure. But could you get rid
of that thing first?

37:32.000 --> 37:34.800
Yeah, no problem.

38:00.840 --> 38:02.840
Hey.

38:04.960 --> 38:06.500
What's going on?

38:06.600 --> 38:08.600
Just thinking.

38:09.440 --> 38:11.440
Oh, yeah, what about?

38:13.360 --> 38:15.560
Everything. I mean,
sometimes it feels like

38:15.880 --> 38:19.040
my life's just one big disaster
after the next, you know?

38:19.400 --> 38:22.400
Like right from the start,
being born into this stupid feud.

38:22.720 --> 38:24.720
All that family hatred.

38:25.040 --> 38:30.080
I mean, it's amazing that I've gone this
far without ending up like one of them.

38:33.080 --> 38:36.720
Well, Richard, you have.

38:37.080 --> 38:38.980
That's what's important, right?

38:39.080 --> 38:41.460
And you are here for a reason,
for a purpose.

38:41.560 --> 38:44.760
You just have to figure out what it is.

38:45.120 --> 38:47.640
How can you have
so much faith, Paige?

38:48.280 --> 38:50.600
I mean, with everything out there,
all the evil...

38:50.920 --> 38:55.800
Well, it's because I don't just see
all the evil, I see all the good too.

38:57.640 --> 38:59.780
Especially in you.

38:59.880 --> 39:01.660
Sometimes I'm not sure.

39:01.760 --> 39:03.420
- I am.
- Well, I hope you're right

39:03.520 --> 39:07.480
because I'm giving up a lot
to see it too.

39:07.800 --> 39:11.600
I mean, my whole life
I've had powers and magic.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.480
And even if I didn't use it,
it was just a part of me.

39:16.520 --> 39:21.240
And now, it's kind of scary to think
that I'm gonna be losing it.

39:23.320 --> 39:25.320
And losing you too.

39:27.240 --> 39:29.640
Well, you have to take care
of yourself first, right?

39:30.800 --> 39:36.360
And as long as I'm around
and bringing magic into your life,

39:37.560 --> 39:39.560
you won't be able to.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
I know.

39:48.200 --> 39:50.840
So have you taken
the power-stripping potion yet?

40:05.200 --> 40:07.420
They're not waking up.
How come they're not waking up?

40:07.520 --> 40:10.040
- Would you relax?
- Relax? I'm sorry, did you say relax?

40:10.360 --> 40:14.120
Because I'm about to disappear,
vanish forever, cease to exist.

40:14.440 --> 40:16.560
Oh, my God, you are so dramatic.

40:18.800 --> 40:20.800
Hey, you okay?

40:22.880 --> 40:26.000
I think so. What are you doing?

40:26.320 --> 40:28.800
I don't know, I swear.

40:30.520 --> 40:32.520
What's going on?

40:34.440 --> 40:37.040
Arabic sleeping potion,
very strong, not good.

40:37.360 --> 40:39.300
You mean Jinny did this?

40:39.400 --> 40:41.620
- Who else?
- Well, we gotta stop her.

40:41.720 --> 40:44.520
We already did while you were
sleeping. She's back in the bottle.

40:44.840 --> 40:48.840
Which we were sort of hoping
you could take care of for us.

40:50.080 --> 40:51.660
So that's it, it's all over?

40:51.760 --> 40:54.320
Pretty much.
I mean, you still forgive me, right?

40:54.640 --> 40:56.640
- Of course.
- Good.

40:56.960 --> 41:00.520
I still wanna know why we all
didn't die. What? I'm curious.

41:01.240 --> 41:04.320
Sure, you don't mind them knowing
that they almost died, but not that l...

41:05.840 --> 41:08.280
- Never mind.
- What are you talking about?

41:08.600 --> 41:10.980
Jinny made a wish for us to die
and we almost did,

41:11.080 --> 41:15.640
- but then we turned into ghosts, and...
- So that wasn't a dream I had.

41:16.040 --> 41:21.240
I was floating over my body,
looking down at me and then...

41:22.920 --> 41:24.660
...you healed me.

41:24.760 --> 41:26.380
- I did?
- Yeah.

41:26.480 --> 41:28.500
I called to you
when you were sleeping

41:28.600 --> 41:32.680
and somehow you must have
heard me and you wouldn't let me go.

41:34.400 --> 41:37.240
Well, then that must be why Phoebe
and Paige's spirits didn't move on.

41:37.560 --> 41:40.120
See, the wish was
for all the Charmed Ones to die.

41:40.440 --> 41:42.620
So saving you
must have saved them.

41:42.720 --> 41:44.500
That was really sweet of you.

41:44.600 --> 41:46.600
Any time.

41:47.440 --> 41:51.000
So you wanna go with me
to get Wyatt?

41:51.760 --> 41:53.760
Sure.

41:56.360 --> 41:58.360
Wait. What...?

41:59.440 --> 42:01.220
What about me?

42:01.320 --> 42:06.080
I wouldn't give up.
There may be hope for you yet.
