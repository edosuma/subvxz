<i> IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM</i>

00:03.371 --> 00:05.354
<i>THE PEOPLE ARE REPRESENTED</i>

00:05.355 --> 00:07.338

00:07.341 --> 00:09.208
<i> THE POLICE,</i>
<i> WHO INVESTIGATE CRIME</i>

<i>AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS,</i>
<i> WHO PROSECUTE THE OFFENDERS.</i>

00:12.346 --> 00:13.545
<i> THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.</i>

00:30.231 --> 00:33.465
OH, GREAT. ANOTHER CITIZEN
WITH HALLUCINATIONS.

00:33.467 --> 00:36.468
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THIS GUY DOING

00:36.470 --> 00:38.470
DOWN HERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

00:38.472 --> 00:41.173
PROBABLY LOOKING
FOR A $10 HAND WAX.

00:41.175 --> 00:42.541
HERE?

00:47.114 --> 00:48.313
LET'S GO.

01:26.387 --> 01:27.686
HEY!

01:27.688 --> 01:29.354
HEY! HEY!

01:35.463 --> 01:38.530
IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE
IN THERE?

01:43.504 --> 01:44.703
WATCH THEM.

02:27.214 --> 02:28.480
KELLY!

02:28.482 --> 02:30.449
IT'S A KID.

02:32.253 --> 02:36.321
Captioning made possible by
UNIVERSAL TELEVISION and NBC

03:56.470 --> 03:58.971
Man:
YOU GOT ONE
THROUGH AND THROUGH.

03:58.973 --> 04:00.539
.38 OR HEAVIER.

04:00.541 --> 04:02.541
THE BODY'S
INTO RIGOR MORTIS

04:02.543 --> 04:05.010
BUT THE EYES
ARE MOIST.

04:05.012 --> 04:06.912
I'D SAY 12 TO 18 HOURS.

04:06.914 --> 04:10.249
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S ROLL HIM OVER.

04:10.251 --> 04:11.316
SLOW.

04:12.886 --> 04:14.386
HOLD HIM.

04:18.792 --> 04:21.260
STUDENT I.D.

04:21.262 --> 04:22.527
BISHOP'S ACADEMY.

04:22.529 --> 04:25.297
ROBBIE FENWICK.

04:25.299 --> 04:27.032
15 YEARS OLD.

04:27.034 --> 04:29.434
DETECTIVE.

04:32.573 --> 04:34.506
Man:
IT'S A .357 MAGNUM.

04:34.508 --> 04:37.442
PROBABLY TRIED
TO CHUCK IT IN THE RIVER

04:37.444 --> 04:38.510
AND CAME UP SHORT.

04:38.512 --> 04:40.379
OKAY. BAG IT AND WORK IT UP.

04:40.381 --> 04:43.015
WE'RE HOLDING THE KIDS
FOR QUESTIONING.

04:43.017 --> 04:44.583
YOU WANT ANYTHING NOW?

04:44.585 --> 04:46.018
IS THAT THEM?

04:46.020 --> 04:48.287
YEAH. COOPERATIVE
LITTLE NOSE WIPES.

04:51.458 --> 04:54.293
OKAY, WHICH ONE OF YOU
IS GOING TO TELL US

04:54.295 --> 04:55.394
ABOUT THAT DEAD BOY?

04:55.396 --> 04:56.461
NOTHING TO TELL.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.363
YOU KNOW HIM?

04:58.365 --> 05:00.465
Cerreta:
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

05:00.467 --> 05:02.467
WE HEARD THERE WAS A BODY.

05:02.469 --> 05:03.935
WE JUST CAME TO SEE.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.404
YOU LIVE AROUND HERE?

05:05.406 --> 05:07.406
JACKSON TOWERS.

05:07.408 --> 05:10.008
YOU CAME HERE
'CAUSE YOU<i> HEARD</i>

05:10.010 --> 05:11.476
THERE WAS A BODY?

05:11.478 --> 05:13.078
SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THAT?

05:13.080 --> 05:15.380
SLUG IS A FIVE
WITH A RIGHT TWIST.

05:15.382 --> 05:17.449
IT'S A WADCUTTER SERIES TWO.

05:17.451 --> 05:19.885
IT'S A PROBABLE MATCH
TO THE WEAPON.

05:19.887 --> 05:23.422
I'VE ONLY SEEN WADCUTTERS
USED IN TARGET PRACTICE.

05:23.424 --> 05:26.325
UH-HUH. WEAPON'S A RUGER
SECURITY SIX .357

05:26.327 --> 05:29.394
CUSTOM PACHMAYR GRIP,
MODIFIED HAMMER AND TRIGGER.

05:29.396 --> 05:30.462
IT'S NOT A TOY.

05:30.464 --> 05:32.531
THE OWNER TOOK
GOOD CARE OF IT.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.633
NO LIVE ROUNDS
IN THE CYLINDER.

05:34.635 --> 05:37.035
THERE'S ONLY
THE ONE SPENT CASING.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.337
THAT'S ALL IT TAKES.

05:38.339 --> 05:40.405
YOU RUN IT
THROUGH THE SYSTEM?

05:40.407 --> 05:41.973
A GUN SO LOVED

05:41.975 --> 05:45.977
IT HAD TO HAVE
ITS VERY OWN LICENSE.

05:45.979 --> 05:51.883
AND IT'S...
IAN MASER, 557 WEST 77th STREET.

05:51.885 --> 05:55.454
DO YOU OWN A RUGER SECURITY SIX
.357 MAGNUM PISTOL?

05:55.456 --> 05:56.955
I DO.

05:56.957 --> 06:00.559
IT HAS BEEN FOUND
AT THE SCENE OF A HOMICIDE

06:00.561 --> 06:02.594
AND DETERMINED
THE MURDER WEAPON.

06:02.596 --> 06:05.530
I KEEP THAT GUN LOCKED
IN MY BEDSIDE TABLE.

06:05.532 --> 06:08.533
THIS IT?

06:10.604 --> 06:11.737
YES, IT IS.

06:11.739 --> 06:14.606
DOES ANYONE ELSE
HAVE ACCESS TO THIS GUN?

06:14.608 --> 06:16.007
THERE'S THE MAID.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.542
ARE YOU MARRIED?

06:17.544 --> 06:18.610
DIVORCED.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.512
DOES ANYONE LIVE WITH YOU?

06:20.514 --> 06:21.546
THERE'S MY SON.

06:21.548 --> 06:24.416
WHERE DOES
HE GO TO SCHOOL?

06:24.418 --> 06:25.417
BISHOP'S ACADEMY.

06:25.419 --> 06:26.418
HE'S NOT THERE.

06:26.420 --> 06:27.953
HE'S UP IN HIS ROOM.

06:27.955 --> 06:29.521
HE'S NOT FEELING WELL.

06:29.523 --> 06:30.522
DO YOU MIND

06:30.524 --> 06:32.090
IF WE TALK WITH HIM?

06:40.167 --> 06:41.566
JAMIE.

06:44.571 --> 06:45.971
JAMIE.

06:52.446 --> 06:57.482
JAMIE, CAN WE ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS?

07:00.521 --> 07:02.988
IF YOU WANTED
TO SHOW ROBBIE THE GUN

07:02.990 --> 07:05.424
WHY DID YOU GO
TO THE WAREHOUSE?

07:05.426 --> 07:08.427
THAT WAS HIS IDEA.

07:08.429 --> 07:10.729
HE WANTED TO SHOOT IT.

07:10.731 --> 07:13.098
THEN WHAT DID YOU DO?

07:15.202 --> 07:17.102
ROBBIE HAD THE GUN.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.671
HE WAS AIMING IT AROUND.

07:19.673 --> 07:24.042
THEN I HAD IT,
AND I WAS HOLDING IT.

07:24.044 --> 07:28.480
SHOW US HOW YOU
WERE HOLDING IT.

07:28.482 --> 07:32.083
ABOUT HERE--
LIKE WAIST HEIGHT.

07:32.085 --> 07:36.521
DID YOU HAVE YOUR FINGER
ON THE TRIGGER?

07:36.523 --> 07:39.191
I DON'T REMEMBER.

07:39.193 --> 07:42.027
Cerreta:
WHERE WAS ROBBIE?

07:42.029 --> 07:46.465
HE WAS STANDING
LIKE ABOUT WHERE YOU ARE.

07:46.467 --> 07:47.799
THAT CLOSE?

07:47.801 --> 07:49.234
UH-HUH.

07:49.236 --> 07:53.171
HE WANTED ME
TO GIVE HIM BACK THE GUN.

07:53.173 --> 07:56.208
HE REACHED OVER,
YOU KNOW, LIKE THIS...

07:56.210 --> 07:58.243
IT WENT OFF.

07:58.245 --> 08:00.212
DID YOU SEE IF HE WAS ALIVE?

08:00.214 --> 08:02.547
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

08:02.549 --> 08:04.716
HE LOOKED DEAD.

08:04.718 --> 08:07.018
I FREAKED.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.221
I JUST JAMMED OUT OF THERE.

08:09.223 --> 08:11.656
I DIDN'T MEAN IT, YOU KNOW.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.592
I REALLY DIDN'T.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.026
I SWEAR.

08:15.028 --> 08:17.662
IT JUST WENT OFF.

08:17.664 --> 08:20.499
IT JUST DID.

08:20.501 --> 08:23.101
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
A SCARED 15-YEAR-OLD.

08:23.103 --> 08:26.037
I DON'T SEE WHY WE
GOT TO CHARGE HIM.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.506
Cragen:
WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST--

08:27.508 --> 08:29.841
SENDING HIM HOME
WITH A LOLLIPOP?

08:29.843 --> 08:32.177
WE GOT TO CHARGE THIS KID

08:32.179 --> 08:34.196
WITH SOMETHING.

08:34.197 --> 08:36.214
Robinette:
THERE'S ENOUGH
TO SUPPORT A CHARGE

08:36.216 --> 08:38.250
OF RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT.

08:38.252 --> 08:40.218
EVEN SECOND DEGREE'S
A STRETCH.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.220
CRIMINAL POSSESSION OF A WEAPON.

08:42.222 --> 08:44.656
WE COULD ALWAYS UPGRADE
IF NECESSARY.

08:44.658 --> 08:47.692
(<i> phone ringing</i> )

08:47.694 --> 08:49.294
YEAH?

08:49.296 --> 08:51.797
MM-HMM.

08:51.798 --> 08:54.299
THE DESK HAS ROBBIE FENWICK'S
PARENTS ON THE LINE.

08:54.301 --> 08:57.269
I'LL TAKE IT OUTSIDE.

09:02.543 --> 09:04.309
HOW CLOSE ARE YOU
TO WRAPPING UP?

09:04.311 --> 09:07.779
WE JUST GOT THE CRIME SCENE
REPORT THIS MORNING.

09:07.781 --> 09:10.315
WE JUST HAVE TO WALK IT THROUGH.

09:10.317 --> 09:12.284
MAYBE A DAY OR SO.

09:15.856 --> 09:18.723
ROBBIE IS STANDING
RIGHT ABOUT HERE.

09:20.661 --> 09:26.264
AND THAT MEANS JAMIE'S
ABOUT HERE WITH THE GUN.

09:26.266 --> 09:29.901
ENTRY WOUND IN THE RIGHT TEMPLE,
OUT THE BACK LEFT.

09:29.903 --> 09:33.204
ROBBIE TURNED HIS HEAD AWAY.

09:33.206 --> 09:36.675
WE HAVE A WOUND
ON HIS RIGHT HAND.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.310
HE WAS ASKING FOR THE GUN.

09:38.312 --> 09:39.678
IF HE WAS REACHING

09:39.680 --> 09:42.213
HE WOULD HAVE
TO BE CLOSER TO JAMIE

09:42.215 --> 09:46.651
AND THERE WOULD BE POWDER BURNS
ON THE RIGHT HAND.

09:46.653 --> 09:48.320
BUT THERE WEREN'T ANY.

09:48.322 --> 09:49.788
SO THE GUN HAS TO BE

09:49.790 --> 09:52.257
AT LEAST
A COUPLE FEET AWAY.

09:52.259 --> 09:55.260
YEAH. ALL RIGHT,
LET'S PUT HIM ABOUT...

09:55.262 --> 09:57.362
HERE.

09:57.364 --> 09:59.230
ALL RIGHT, HIS HAND
HAS TO BE HERE.

09:59.232 --> 10:01.900
HOW DID HE GET THE HAND HIT?

10:04.204 --> 10:07.639
UNLESS HE'S LIKE THIS.

10:09.743 --> 10:11.309
HIS HANDS ARE UP HERE

10:11.311 --> 10:14.312
BECAUSE HE'S TRYING
TO PROTECT HIMSELF.

10:14.314 --> 10:18.817
AND IF JAMIE WAS CRADLING
THE GUN DOWN HERE

10:18.819 --> 10:22.253
WELL, HE'D HAVE GUNSHOT RESIDUE
ON HIS SHIRT.

10:22.255 --> 10:24.656
THE TESTS WERE NEGATIVE.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.960
WE'D GET
A HIGHER BULLET HIT.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.662
WE SUPPOSED TO BE

10:30.664 --> 10:33.665
SURPRISED EVERY TIME
SOMEBODY LIES TO US?

10:33.667 --> 10:35.967
Cerreta:
WE TOOK WHAT YOU TOLD US

10:35.969 --> 10:38.870
AND PUT IT
ALONGSIDE THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE

10:38.872 --> 10:40.639
AND IT JUST DOESN'T MATCH.

10:40.641 --> 10:44.242
FOR STARTERS, YOU WEREN'T
STANDING NEXT TO ROBBIE

10:44.244 --> 10:45.810
WHEN THE GUN WENT OFF

10:45.812 --> 10:47.345
RIGHT?

10:47.347 --> 10:52.283
AND YOU WEREN'T HOLDING THE GUN
THE WAY YOU SAID YOU WERE.

10:52.285 --> 10:53.284
ALSO RIGHT?

10:53.286 --> 10:54.853
Cerreta:
IF THERE'S

10:54.855 --> 10:57.322
SOMETHING YOU WANT TO TELL US

10:57.324 --> 10:59.357
THIS IS THE TIME.

10:59.359 --> 11:00.825
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.694
YOU CAN TALK TO THEM.

11:05.899 --> 11:09.334
WE WERE PLAYING A GAME.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.770
WHAT KIND OF GAME?

11:11.772 --> 11:13.304
TRUST.

11:13.306 --> 11:16.341
SEE, YOU AIM THE GUN
AT THE OTHER GUY

11:16.343 --> 11:18.777
LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO SHOOT HIM

11:18.779 --> 11:21.713
UNTIL HE TELLS YOU TO STOP,
UNTIL HE GIVES.

11:21.715 --> 11:24.716
WHOSE IDEA WAS THIS GAME?

11:24.718 --> 11:27.452
I DON'T REMEMBER.

11:27.454 --> 11:29.788
ALL YOU WANT TO DO

11:29.790 --> 11:32.290
IS LET THE OTHER GUY GIVE.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.325
YOU DON'T WANT TO HURT HIM.

11:34.327 --> 11:36.327
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

11:36.329 --> 11:41.266
WELL, I WAS AIMING AT ROBBIE...

11:41.268 --> 11:44.436
AND I WAS SQUEEZING
THE TRIGGER REAL SLOW.

11:44.438 --> 11:46.705
Cerreta:
DIDN'T IT OCCUR TO YOU

11:46.707 --> 11:49.307
THAT THIS GUN MIGHT GO OFF?

11:49.309 --> 11:52.077
THERE WAS NO WAY
IT WAS GOING TO GO OFF.

11:52.079 --> 11:56.948
I DIDN'T COCK THE HAMMER
BEFORE PULLING THE TRIGGER.

11:56.950 --> 11:59.417
YOU HAVE
TO COCK THE HAMMER

11:59.419 --> 12:01.386
WITH YOUR THUMB.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.054
WHERE DID YOU LEARN THAT?

12:03.056 --> 12:06.391
WELL, THAT'S THE WAY
WE ALWAYS DID IT

12:06.393 --> 12:09.027
WHEN WE WENT
TO THE RANGE.

12:09.029 --> 12:14.833
I SWEAR, THERE WAS NO WAY
IT WAS GOING TO GO OFF.

12:14.835 --> 12:17.001
YOU EVER FIRE
ONE OF THESE?

12:17.003 --> 12:18.369
NEVER.

12:18.371 --> 12:20.972
STRICTLY
FOR COMPETITION SHOOTERS.

12:20.974 --> 12:24.309
Cerreta:
YOU HAVE TO MANUALLY
COCK THE HAMMER.

12:24.311 --> 12:26.010
Shrier:
NOW IT'S READY.

12:26.012 --> 12:27.278
(<i> gun clicks</i> )

12:27.280 --> 12:30.115
NOW, I KNOW YOU'VE
FIRED ONE OF THESE

12:30.117 --> 12:32.350
.357 DOUBLE-ACTION
REVOLVER.

12:32.352 --> 12:35.286
THE GUN DOES IT
ALL FOR YOU.

12:35.288 --> 12:38.990
SO IT'S POSSIBLE THE KID MADE
A LEGITIMATE MISTAKE.

12:38.992 --> 12:40.525
POSSIBLE, SURE.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.393
I DON'T KNOW.

12:42.395 --> 12:43.995
THE KID TAKES AIM

12:43.997 --> 12:46.965
SQUEEZES THE TRIGGER SLOWLY,
LIKE HE SAYS.

12:46.967 --> 12:48.867
HE'S LOOKING DOWN THE SIGHT.

12:48.869 --> 12:51.069
Shrier:
IF HE WAS
TRAINED TO SHOOT

12:51.071 --> 12:53.404
HE WAS TRAINED
TO LOOK DOWN THE SIGHTS.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.540
YOU CAN'T TELL ME
HE DIDN'T NOTICE

12:55.542 --> 12:57.542
THAT HAMMER
COCKING BACK.

13:02.883 --> 13:05.416
HE KNEW
THAT GUN WAS GOING TO FIRE.

13:14.461 --> 13:17.428
HOW LONG HAS JAMIE
BEEN AT BISHOP ACADEMY?

13:17.430 --> 13:20.231
HE CAME HERE
THE MIDDLE OF LAST YEAR.

13:20.233 --> 13:22.367
LATE TRANSFERS
ARE NEVER EASY.

13:22.369 --> 13:24.536
JAMIE NEVER GOT OVER THE HUMP.

13:24.538 --> 13:26.371
Cerreta:
IN HIS STUDIES?

13:26.373 --> 13:28.039
HE WAS A FAIR STUDENT.

13:28.041 --> 13:32.110
THE PROBLEM IS, HE NEVER
LATCHED ONTO ANY PEER GROUP.

13:32.112 --> 13:34.279
Logan:
EXCEPT FOR ROBBIE.

13:34.281 --> 13:37.048
ROBBIE WAS
A BIT OF AN OUTCAST.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.117
NOT TOTALLY.

13:39.118 --> 13:41.185
I HAD HOPED
HE'D HELP JAMIE ASSIMILATE.

13:41.188 --> 13:42.453
NEVER HAPPENED.

13:42.455 --> 13:44.556
YOU EVER TALK TO JAMIE'S FATHER?

13:44.558 --> 13:46.057
INITIAL INTERVIEW

13:46.059 --> 13:48.593
AND ONCE TO ASK
ABOUT JAMIE'S MEDICATION.

13:48.595 --> 13:51.296
WHAT KIND OF MEDICATION?

13:51.298 --> 13:54.899
WELL, HIS FILE SAYS
IT'S A PSYCHIATRIC PRESCRIPTION.

13:54.901 --> 13:57.569
MR. MASER DOWNPLAYED
THE WHOLE THING.

13:57.571 --> 13:59.237
DIDN'T GO INTO DETAILS.

13:59.239 --> 14:02.140
DID HE HAVE MOOD SWINGS
OR OUTBURSTS?

14:02.142 --> 14:04.442
NOT THAT
THE TEACHERS OBSERVED.

14:04.444 --> 14:08.446
BUT AS I SAID,
HE'S A VERY QUIET YOUNG MAN.

14:08.448 --> 14:13.184
I'M NOT EVEN SURE HOW WELL
HIS CLASSMATES KNOW HIM.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.386
I GOT THIS WEIRD VIBE FROM HIM.

14:15.388 --> 14:18.323
SOMETIMES HE HAD THIS LOOK,
THIS STARE--

14:18.325 --> 14:22.560
YOU JUST KNEW THE GEARS WERE,
LIKE, MASHING UP IN HIS HEAD.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.929
DID HE TRY TO MAKE FRIENDS?

14:24.931 --> 14:26.164
YEAH, AT FIRST.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.366
YOU KNOW, NEW KID AT MID-TERM--

14:28.368 --> 14:32.337
BUT WE'VE ALL BEEN GOING
TO SCHOOL TOGETHER FOR YEARS.

14:32.339 --> 14:34.172
NOBODY HAD TIME FOR HIM.

14:34.174 --> 14:35.206
EXCEPT ROBBIE.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.941
NOW, THAT GUY WAS TWISTED.

14:36.943 --> 14:38.543
TWISTED? HOW?

14:38.545 --> 14:40.245
HE WAS ALWAYS TALKING

14:40.247 --> 14:45.250
ABOUT GUNS AND,
LIKE, SHOOTING AND GETTING HIGH.

14:45.252 --> 14:48.219
DID YOU EVER HEAR JAMIE
TALK ABOUT GUNS?

14:48.221 --> 14:49.554
NO. THAT WAS ROBBIE.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.890
HE WAS MAXED OUT ON WAR STUFF.

14:51.892 --> 14:56.261
WHEN BUSH DID HIS THING IN IRAQ,
ROBBIE WAS TOTALLY INTO IT.

14:56.263 --> 14:58.463
HE KNEW EVERY WEAPON THEY HAD.

14:58.465 --> 15:00.431
WE CALLED HIM DEUCE-DEUCE.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.400
WHY IS THAT?

15:02.402 --> 15:05.336
LAST YEAR, HE SHOWED UP
WITH THIS .22.

15:05.338 --> 15:08.573
I THINK HIS OLD MAN
ENDED UP TAKING IT OFF HIM.

15:10.377 --> 15:12.977
CLAIRE FOUND IT
IN HIS DRESSER.

15:12.979 --> 15:16.414
I WAS NEVER ABLE
TO GET A STRAIGHT ANSWER

15:16.416 --> 15:19.450
AS TO WHERE HE GOT IT.

15:19.452 --> 15:20.952
(<i> sighs</i> )

15:20.954 --> 15:23.955
THE BOYS SPEND
A LOT OF TIME IN HERE?

15:23.957 --> 15:26.624
JAMIE'D BEEN HERE
A FEW TIMES.

15:26.626 --> 15:30.161
HE WAS ALWAYS POLITE.

15:30.163 --> 15:31.629
HE DIDN'T TALK MUCH.

15:33.533 --> 15:35.533
ROBBIE LOVED GUNS.

15:35.535 --> 15:37.535
HE WAS FASCINATED

15:37.537 --> 15:39.270
WITH THE FACT

15:39.272 --> 15:43.007
THAT JAMIE'S FATHER WAS
A COMPETITION SHOOTER.

15:43.009 --> 15:46.411
NEITHER OF US KNOW WHY,
OR WHERE IT CAME FROM

15:46.413 --> 15:50.415
BUT HE JUST...
HE SEEMED TO, UH...

15:50.417 --> 15:53.418
FEED OFF OF IT.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.461
FIRST FEW MONTHS, NOTHING.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.698
WOULDN'T TALK TO ME
ABOUT THE NEW SCHOOL.

16:06.700 --> 16:09.567
WHEN HE FIRST HOOKED UP
WITH ROBBIE

16:09.569 --> 16:12.303
I WAS HAPPY HE'D MADE A FRIEND.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.339
HE HAS TROUBLE MAKING FRIENDS?

16:14.341 --> 16:17.575
JAMIE WOULDN'T WIN
ANY POPULARITY CONTESTS.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.610
HE'S... SELF-RELIANT.

16:19.612 --> 16:21.980
DID SOMETHING
CHANGE YOUR MIND

16:21.982 --> 16:23.448
ABOUT ROBBIE?

16:23.450 --> 16:25.750
A FEW MONTHS AGO, JAMIE ASKED ME

16:25.752 --> 16:29.721
IF HE AND ROBBIE COULD COME
TO THE FIRING RANGE WITH ME.

16:29.723 --> 16:32.590
I GOT THE IMPRESSION
IT WAS ROBBIE'S IDEA.

16:32.592 --> 16:35.593
SO WHAT ABOUT THE MEDICATION?

16:35.595 --> 16:36.728
WHAT ABOUT IT?

16:36.730 --> 16:39.597
CAN YOU TELL US
WHAT IT'S FOR?

16:39.599 --> 16:41.733
WHEN DID JAMIE START TAKING IT?

16:41.735 --> 16:43.067
I'D BE HAPPY TO

16:43.069 --> 16:45.536
IF I DIDN'T THINK
I'D GO TO JAIL.

16:45.538 --> 16:46.537
WHAT?

16:46.539 --> 16:49.674
IT'S TERMS OF MY DIVORCE.

16:51.044 --> 16:54.779
IT'S PARTLY WHY JAMIE'S
ON MEDICATION.

16:54.781 --> 16:57.515
WOULD YOU TELL US
YOUR EX-WIFE'S ADDRESS.

16:57.517 --> 17:01.419
305 WEST 21st STREET.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.688
BUT IT WON'T
DO YOU ANY GOOD.

17:03.690 --> 17:06.758
SHE CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT EITHER.

17:06.760 --> 17:08.760
YOU KNOW, BEFORE THE ACADEMY

17:08.762 --> 17:12.063
THE ONLY GUN I EVER SHOT
WAS A BB GUN.

17:12.065 --> 17:15.066
MY DAD LET ME SHOOT
A STACK OF NEWSPAPERS

17:15.068 --> 17:16.034
IN THE BASEMENT.

17:16.036 --> 17:18.503
ONE DAY,
I WING A PIGEON, RIGHT?

17:18.505 --> 17:21.039
HE FLIPS OUT,
THROWS THE GUN AWAY

17:21.041 --> 17:23.775
MAKES ME BRING
THE DAMN BIRD TO THE VET

17:23.777 --> 17:25.777
IN A SHOE BOX ON THE BUS.

17:25.779 --> 17:27.612
TO THIS DAY, I HATE PIGEONS.

17:27.614 --> 17:29.280
THEY'RE RATS WITH WINGS.

17:29.282 --> 17:31.115
WHEN YOU
GIVE A BOY A GUN

17:31.117 --> 17:33.451
HE MAY GO
AFTER BIGGER GAME.

17:33.453 --> 17:35.453
THAT WAS
MY MOTHER'S ARGUMENT.

17:35.455 --> 17:37.455
THAT'S EVERY MOTHER'S
ARGUMENT.

17:37.457 --> 17:39.390
"YOU'LL PUT YOUR EYE OUT."

17:39.392 --> 17:40.658
"YOU'LL GET HURT."

17:40.660 --> 17:42.794
I BET JAMIE'S MOTHER'S
NO DIFFERENT.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.530
I CAN'T.

17:45.532 --> 17:49.434
JAMIE'S THERAPY IS...
TIED TO THE DIVORCE.

17:49.436 --> 17:51.736
IT'S PRETTY MUCH
THE REASON WE SPLIT.

17:51.738 --> 17:54.472
YOU DIVORCED
BECAUSE JAMIE'S IN THERAPY?

17:54.474 --> 17:58.843
NO. THE INCIDENT
THAT LED TO THE THERAPY.

17:58.845 --> 18:01.079
YOU CAN'T
PUSH ME ON THIS.

18:01.081 --> 18:02.080
IT'S BEEN SEALED.

18:02.082 --> 18:04.549
PART OF
THE NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT

18:04.551 --> 18:07.385
WAS THAT IAN AND I
HONOR THAT SEAL.

18:07.387 --> 18:11.089
MRS. MASER, A BOY IS DEAD.

18:11.091 --> 18:13.558
ALL OF OUR INSTINCTS
TELL US

18:13.560 --> 18:16.794
THERE'S SOMETHING
WE SHOULD KNOW HERE.

18:16.796 --> 18:19.597
HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO JAMIE LATELY?

18:19.599 --> 18:23.367
IT'S NOT MY TIME TO SEE HIM.

18:23.369 --> 18:25.136
TERMS OF THE DIVORCE.

18:25.138 --> 18:27.338
EVEN UNDER EXTRAORDINARY
CIRCUMSTANCES?

18:27.340 --> 18:29.540
HIS FATHER IS VERY ABSOLUTE

18:29.542 --> 18:31.642
ABOUT THINGS.

18:31.644 --> 18:33.678
MY SON AND I

18:33.680 --> 18:37.582
ARE JUST GETTING
BACK ON TRACK, DETECTIVE.

18:37.584 --> 18:39.650
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

18:39.652 --> 18:43.387
HE DOESN'T REALLY
TALK TO ME THAT MUCH.

18:43.389 --> 18:44.622
SHE SAID SEALED.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.792
THAT CAN MEAN ONLY ONE THING:
HE WAS IN TROUBLE.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.794
OH, NO, NO,
WAIT A MINUTE.

18:49.796 --> 18:53.698
ARE YOU TELLING ME THE KID'S
JUVENILE RECORD IS SEALED

18:53.700 --> 18:56.167
<i>AND</i> FORBIDS THEM
TO TALK ABOUT IT?

18:56.169 --> 18:58.603
WHAT KIND
OF A SETTLEMENT IS THAT?

18:58.605 --> 18:59.737
IF WHAT HAPPENED

18:59.739 --> 19:02.440
WAS SEVERE ENOUGH
TO SPLIT THE FAMILY

19:02.442 --> 19:05.877
IT COULD BE ARGUED<i> BOTH</i>
ARE IN HIS BEST INTEREST.

19:05.879 --> 19:09.614
GREAT. SOMETHING'S THERE,
<i> AND</i> WE CAN'T LOOK AT IT.

19:09.616 --> 19:11.182
TO GET A COURT ORDER

19:11.184 --> 19:14.785
TO OPEN THE RECORD, I MUST
SHOW RELEVANCE, WHICH MEANS

19:14.787 --> 19:16.854
KNOWING WHAT'S
IN THE RECORD.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.189
WHAT A SYSTEM.

19:18.191 --> 19:20.491
WITH
A PROSECUTOR'S JUDGE

19:20.493 --> 19:21.826
MAYBE WE GET LUCKY

19:21.828 --> 19:23.895
BUT JAMIE'S
A YOUTHFUL OFFENDER.

19:23.897 --> 19:26.597
AND THEN WE'VE
SHOWN OUR HAND.

19:26.599 --> 19:27.632
YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:27.634 --> 19:28.900
SCREW THE RECORD.

19:28.902 --> 19:30.902
SOME COP HAD TO WRITE IT UP.

19:30.904 --> 19:33.171
THEY USED TO LIVE IN CHELSEA.

19:33.173 --> 19:35.706
THE REPORT MUST BE
IN THE PRECINCT.

19:35.708 --> 19:37.909
THE SEAL APPLIES
TO POLICE FILES

19:37.911 --> 19:40.178
AS WELL AS TO REPORTS
AND NOTES

19:40.180 --> 19:41.812
OF THE INVESTIGATING
OFFICER.

19:41.814 --> 19:44.649
YOU THINK IT APPLIES
TO WHAT THE OFFICER

19:44.651 --> 19:46.851
<i> MIGHT</i> SAY
A FEW YEARS LATER?

19:54.761 --> 19:57.795
HAPPENED
OVER NEAR EAST RIVER PARK.

19:57.797 --> 20:00.798
SOMETHING I NEVER LIKED
ABOUT THAT CASE.

20:00.800 --> 20:04.468
WHAT ARE TWO KIDS
DOING THERE WITH A GUN, HUH?

20:04.470 --> 20:07.638
THE ONLY THING THERE
IS JUNKIES AND SQUATTERS.

20:07.640 --> 20:10.474
AND THE OTHER KID
ENDS UP DEAD.

20:10.476 --> 20:11.809
AN ACCIDENT. RIGHT.

20:11.811 --> 20:14.812
AN ACCIDENT ASKING TO HAPPEN
IS WHAT I SAY.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.447
RAY...

20:16.449 --> 20:18.616
DID YOU KEEP
YOUR OWN NOTES?

20:18.618 --> 20:19.884
OFF THE RECORD.

20:21.287 --> 20:24.822
NEVER KNOW
WHEN YOU MIGHT NEED THEM, RIGHT?

20:24.824 --> 20:26.857
IT HAPPENED WHEN JAMIE WAS 13.

20:26.859 --> 20:29.560
THE OTHER KID, GRAHAM CAMPBELL,
WAS 12.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.896
IT WAS THE SAME THING--
ONE TO THE HEAD.

20:31.898 --> 20:35.566
THE GUN WAS A COLT PYTHON
REGISTERED TO IAN MASER.

20:35.568 --> 20:36.734
RULED AN ACCIDENT.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.220
HE TOLD THE DETECTIVE

20:39.221 --> 20:41.705
HE WAS TRYING TO SHOW
HIS FRIEND HOW THE GUN WORKED.

20:41.708 --> 20:44.909
JAMIE'S 13, WHITE,
MIDDLE CLASS, NO PRIORS.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.877
Cerreta:
HERE'S THE KICKER.

20:46.879 --> 20:49.313
HE THOUGHT YOU HAD TO COCK
THE HAMMER BY HAND

20:49.315 --> 20:50.948
BEFORE YOU COULD
FIRE IT.

20:50.950 --> 20:52.717
SAME EXCUSE AS NOW.

20:52.719 --> 20:53.985
WORKED THE FIRST TIME.

20:53.987 --> 20:54.986
WHY CHANGE IT?

20:54.988 --> 20:56.587
ANYTHING ELSE?

20:56.589 --> 20:57.888
THE TWO SHOOTINGS

20:57.890 --> 21:00.191
ARE IDENTICAL.

21:00.192 --> 21:02.493
MASER CLAIMS JAMIE DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TO WORK THE GUN.

21:02.495 --> 21:03.694
HE'S LYING.

21:03.696 --> 21:05.796
WE GET A STATEMENT;
HE PERJURES HIMSELF.

21:05.798 --> 21:06.864
IT GOES DEEPER.

21:06.866 --> 21:09.634
WE KNOW HE WANTED
TO SCARE ROBBIE.

21:09.636 --> 21:11.969
WE MUST PROVE
HE WANTED TO KILL HIM.

21:11.971 --> 21:14.872
HE'D POINTED A GUN
AT SOMEBODY BEFORE.

21:14.874 --> 21:17.341
HE HAD PULLED
THE TRIGGER BEFORE.

21:17.343 --> 21:19.510
HE KNEW THE CONSEQUENCES.

21:19.512 --> 21:21.912
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH
TO PROVE INTENT?

21:21.914 --> 21:26.517
LEGALLY, WE MAY NOT EVEN BE ABLE
TO USE THE FIRST SHOOTING.

21:26.519 --> 21:28.819
YOU WANT TO GO DOWN

21:28.821 --> 21:29.820
TO MAN TWO?

21:29.822 --> 21:31.822
I WANT HIM
AT MURDER TWO.

21:31.824 --> 21:34.325
DEPRAVED INDIFFERENCE
TO HUMAN LIFE.

21:34.327 --> 21:35.860
NO NEED TO PROVE INTENT.

21:35.862 --> 21:38.796
AND WE TRY HIM AS AN ADULT.

21:46.773 --> 21:47.905
JAMIE.

21:47.907 --> 21:49.340
COME HERE A MINUTE.

21:49.342 --> 21:50.908
WHAT? UH...

21:50.910 --> 21:52.043
COME ON, GET IN.

21:52.045 --> 21:53.611
WHA..?

21:53.613 --> 21:54.879
COME ON, GET IN.

21:54.881 --> 21:56.314
WHY? WHAT FOR?

21:56.316 --> 21:57.982
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
WHAT?

21:57.984 --> 22:00.017
YOU SAID EVERYTHING
WOULD BE FINE.

22:00.019 --> 22:01.686
TAKE IT EASY.

22:01.688 --> 22:03.921
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?

22:03.923 --> 22:05.089
GET AWAY FROM ME!

22:05.091 --> 22:07.925
DO US A FAVOR,
AND GET IN THE CAR.

22:07.927 --> 22:09.960
READ HIM HIS FREAKING RIGHTS,
WILL YOU.

22:11.097 --> 22:13.998
Barnett:
YOUR HONOR,
IT'S MORE THAN OUTRAGEOUS.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.400
THEY PRACTICALLY
DRAGGED THE CHILD

22:16.402 --> 22:18.436
OUT OF THE CLASSROOM.

22:18.438 --> 22:20.071
SPARE US THE HYPERBOLE,
COUNSELOR.

22:20.073 --> 22:21.639
THE PEOPLE ARE INFORMED

22:21.641 --> 22:24.108
THAT THE OFFICERS WERE
OUTSIDE SCHOOL GROUNDS.

22:24.110 --> 22:25.109
TEN FEET?

22:25.111 --> 22:27.078
Barnett:
GIVEN THE DEFENDANT'S AGE

22:27.080 --> 22:30.081
AND THE STRONG-ARM INTENTIONS
OF THE D.A.'s OFFICE

22:30.083 --> 22:33.084
WE INTEND TO ASK
FOR REMOVAL OF THESE PROCEEDINGS

22:33.086 --> 22:34.418
TO FAMILY COURT.

22:34.420 --> 22:35.353
YOUR HONOR

22:35.355 --> 22:36.987
THE PEOPLE FEEL...

22:36.989 --> 22:38.989
I'M AWARE OF THE DEFENDANT'S AGE

22:38.991 --> 22:40.458
MR. BARNETT.

22:40.460 --> 22:43.394
YOU WANT TO MAKE THE MOTION,
FEEL FREE

22:43.396 --> 22:45.463
BUT I SEE NOTHING HERE
TO INDICATE

22:45.465 --> 22:48.065
WHY HE SHOULDN'T BE TRIED
AS AN ADULT.

22:48.067 --> 22:52.036
SUPREME CRIMINAL
TO RETAIN JURISDICTION.

22:52.038 --> 22:54.972
DEFENDANT REMANDED
TO CUSTODY OF HIS FATHER.

22:54.974 --> 22:58.976
OUR CLAIM OF DIMINISHED CAPACITY
IS BASED ON THE FACT

22:58.978 --> 23:01.545
THAT AT THE TIME OF THE SHOOTING

23:01.547 --> 23:04.148
JAMIE WAS
INVOLUNTARILY INTOXICATED.

23:04.150 --> 23:07.451
HE WAS LEGALLY
TAKING A PRESCRIBED MEDICATION

23:07.453 --> 23:10.755
UNDER THE SUPERVISION
OF A LICENSED PSYCHIATRIST.

23:10.757 --> 23:13.124
TRACON IS KNOWN
TO HAVE ADVERSE REACTIONS

23:13.126 --> 23:15.293
IN CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS.

23:15.294 --> 23:17.461
WE CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT
IT AFFECTED HIS ABILITY

23:17.463 --> 23:20.531
TO APPRECIATE THE CONSEQUENCES
OF HIS ACTIONS.

23:20.533 --> 23:23.634
HE HAD THE PRESENCE OF MIND
TO LIE TO THE OFFICERS

23:23.636 --> 23:26.003
AND TO HIDE
THE FACT THAT

23:26.005 --> 23:27.705
HE WAS INVOLVED
IN A PRIOR SHOOTING.

23:27.707 --> 23:30.040
THE PRIOR INCIDENT
IS NOT RELEVANT.

23:30.042 --> 23:32.743
I'M SURE A JURY WILL HAVE
NO TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING

23:32.745 --> 23:34.111
THAT MY YOUNG CLIENT

23:34.113 --> 23:36.046
WAS FRIGHTENED AND CONFUSED.

23:36.048 --> 23:38.182
HE WAS UNDER THE INFLUENCE

23:38.184 --> 23:39.683
OF A POWERFUL PSYCHOTROPIC DRUG.

23:39.685 --> 23:41.419
TRACON DID THE SHOOTING?

23:41.421 --> 23:43.421
I HAVE THE PRECEDENTS
TO BACK IT UP--

23:43.423 --> 23:44.688
GRUNDBERG, PETTY.

23:44.690 --> 23:46.690
CHARGES DISMISSED
AGAINST A WOMAN

23:46.692 --> 23:48.125
WHO SHOT HER MOTHER

23:48.127 --> 23:51.695
AND AN ACQUITTAL ON A GUY
WHO STABBED HIS EX-WIFE?

23:51.697 --> 23:53.798
NEITHER CASE
INVOLVED TRACON.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.667
THE DEFENDANTS DID NOT HAVE
A PREVIOUS HISTORY

23:56.669 --> 23:58.736
OF RECKLESS OR VIOLENT BEHAVIOR.

23:58.738 --> 24:00.104
COME ON, FELLOWS.

24:00.106 --> 24:01.505
YOU'RE BLOWING SMOKE.

24:01.507 --> 24:03.674
NEGLIGENT HOMICIDE AND NO TIME.

24:03.676 --> 24:06.444
I WON'T PLEA THIS DOWN
TO A SLAP ON THE WRIST.

24:06.446 --> 24:09.480
MORE THAN HAPPY
TO LET A JURY DECIDE.

24:09.482 --> 24:10.781
JAMIE?

24:12.485 --> 24:14.552
HAVE A NICE DAY.

24:15.822 --> 24:18.055
NOBODY'S RESPONSIBLE ANYMORE.

24:18.057 --> 24:20.658
YOU KILL SOMEBODY,
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

24:20.660 --> 24:24.228
YOU'RE ADDICTED
TO SUGAR

24:24.230 --> 24:25.629
OR THE WRONG MEDICATION

24:25.631 --> 24:28.232
AND SOMEONE SHOULD PAY YOU
A MILLION DOLLARS

24:28.234 --> 24:29.834
FOR<i> YOUR</i> SUFFERING.

24:29.836 --> 24:32.236
WHO'S DOING JAMIE'S EVALUATION?

24:32.238 --> 24:34.705
I'LL CALL OLIVET.

24:37.577 --> 24:40.478
Woman:
YOU EVER HAD ANY BLACKOUTS?

24:40.480 --> 24:42.480
WHAT ABOUT THE LAST TIME

24:42.482 --> 24:45.149
THINGS DIDN'T TURN OUT
THE WAY YOU WANTED--

24:45.151 --> 24:46.650
HOW DID YOU HANDLE IT?

24:46.652 --> 24:48.519
DID YOU GET MAD?

24:48.521 --> 24:50.221
DID YOU YELL?

24:50.223 --> 24:52.223
DID YOU TRASH YOUR ROOM?

24:52.225 --> 24:54.225
I JUST GOT OVER IT.

24:54.227 --> 24:56.060
HOW ABOUT YOUR DAD?

24:56.062 --> 24:59.163
WHEN HE GETS ANGRY,
DOES HE LET YOU KNOW IT?

24:59.165 --> 25:01.265
YEAH, I GUESS SO.

25:01.267 --> 25:03.267
WHAT ABOUT WITH ROBBIE?

25:03.269 --> 25:06.103
WHEN YOU WERE POINTING
THE GUN AT HIM

25:06.105 --> 25:09.106
WHAT WERE YOU FEELING?

25:09.108 --> 25:10.875
I WASN'T FEELING ANYTHING.

25:10.877 --> 25:14.278
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ROBBIE WAS FEELING?

25:14.280 --> 25:16.146
SCARED.

25:16.148 --> 25:17.882
HE FELT SCARED.

25:17.884 --> 25:22.586
AND GRAHAM CAMPBELL--
HOW ABOUT HIM?

25:22.588 --> 25:24.288
I DON'T REMEMBER.

25:24.290 --> 25:27.091
YOU REMEMBER
HOW<i> YOU</i> FELT?

25:28.895 --> 25:30.561
I THINK YOU DO.

25:30.563 --> 25:32.263
YOU WANT TO TELL ME

25:32.265 --> 25:33.631
ABOUT IT?

25:33.633 --> 25:35.633
NOTHING TO TELL.

25:35.635 --> 25:38.168
I HEAR YOU SAY THAT,
BUT I'M SEEING

25:38.170 --> 25:40.070
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

25:40.072 --> 25:43.073
(<i> sighs</i> )

25:43.075 --> 25:46.310
LET'S TRY
SOMETHING ELSE HERE.

25:46.312 --> 25:48.312
OKAY.

25:48.314 --> 25:50.180
I WANT YOU TO MAKE UP A STORY

25:50.182 --> 25:52.616
BASED ON THE PICTURES
I'LL SHOW YOU.

25:52.618 --> 25:55.152
TELL ME THE CHARACTERS,
WHAT THEY'RE THINKING

25:55.154 --> 25:58.322
WHAT LED UP TO THE SCENE
IN THE PICTURE.

25:58.324 --> 25:59.690
OKAY?

26:02.161 --> 26:05.596
WHAT'S HAPPENING
IN THIS PICTURE, JAMIE?

26:05.598 --> 26:06.864
I DON'T KNOW.

26:06.866 --> 26:08.866
YES, YOU DO.

26:10.903 --> 26:12.202
(<i> sighs</i> )

26:12.204 --> 26:14.805
HE'S TRYING TO LEARN THE VIOLIN.

26:14.807 --> 26:16.807
WHAT ELSE?

26:16.809 --> 26:19.343
HE'S PRETTY LAME WITH IT.

26:19.345 --> 26:22.346
WHAT ABOUT THE LOOK ON HIS FACE?

26:22.348 --> 26:24.015
WHAT ABOUT IT?

26:24.016 --> 26:25.683
DO YOU THINK
HE'LL PICK IT UP?

26:25.685 --> 26:26.951
THINK HE'LL TRY IT?

26:26.953 --> 26:27.952
I DON'T KNOW.

26:27.954 --> 26:29.653
THINK HE<i> WANTS</i> TO?

26:29.655 --> 26:32.690
THINK HE'S GOT TO.

26:32.692 --> 26:34.224
WHY'S THAT?

26:34.226 --> 26:36.594
'CAUSE IF HE DOESN'T

26:36.595 --> 26:38.963
HIS OLD MAN WILL PROBABLY
BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF HIM.

26:38.965 --> 26:40.331
PROBABLY SERVES HIM RIGHT.

26:40.333 --> 26:42.333
WHY DOES IT SERVE HIM RIGHT?

26:42.335 --> 26:44.234
HE'S GOT TO LEARN IT, RIGHT?

26:44.236 --> 26:45.836
I DON'T KNOW. DOES HE?

26:45.838 --> 26:47.838
What's the point otherwise?

26:47.840 --> 26:49.239
Of what?

26:49.241 --> 26:51.241
Of taking the stupid lessons

26:51.243 --> 26:53.978
if he's not going to learn
how to play it?

26:53.980 --> 26:55.980
HE'S A PSYCHOLOGICALLY
ABUSED KID

26:55.982 --> 26:57.982
WITH AN INCREDIBLY
EXACTING FATHER.

26:57.984 --> 26:59.883
CONFIRMS WHAT CERRETA
AND LOGAN

26:59.885 --> 27:01.619
PICKED UP
FROM THE MOTHER.

27:01.621 --> 27:03.754
ABUSED KIDS FOLLOW
ONE OF TWO TRACKS--

27:03.756 --> 27:06.957
THEY PLACE THEMSELVES
WHERE THEY WILL BE VICTIMIZED

27:06.959 --> 27:09.393
OR THEY IDENTIFY
WITH THE AGGRESSOR--

27:09.395 --> 27:11.328
INTERNALIZE HIS QUALITIES

27:11.330 --> 27:12.963
HIS POWER, HIS STRENGTH.

27:12.965 --> 27:15.866
Stone:
AND HE BECAME
THE AGGRESSOR.

27:15.868 --> 27:18.335
WHAT EFFECT DID TRACON HAVE
ON HIS BEHAVIOR?

27:18.337 --> 27:20.237
IT'S AN ANTI-ANXIETY DRUG.

27:20.239 --> 27:24.008
IT CAN AFFECT MOOD, MEMORY,
ANY NUMBER OF VARIABLES.

27:24.010 --> 27:25.676
I THINK JAMIE'S BEHAVIOR

27:25.678 --> 27:28.278
PREDATES ADMINISTRATION
OF THE DRUG.

27:28.280 --> 27:30.681
JAMIE EXHIBITS
REPETITION COMPULSION--

27:30.683 --> 27:33.684
A NEED TO ACT OUT
HIS SUBCONSCIOUS CONFLICT.

27:33.686 --> 27:35.352
HE WANTS TO FEEL POWERFUL.

27:35.354 --> 27:37.688
HE ENJOYS THE FEAR HE CREATES.

27:37.690 --> 27:40.224
THAT'S WHAT THIS GAME
WITH THE FENWICK KID

27:40.226 --> 27:41.225
WAS ALL ABOUT.

27:41.227 --> 27:42.693
DRUG OR NO DRUG

27:42.695 --> 27:45.429
HE'LL PLAY IT AGAIN
THE FIRST CHANCE HE GETS.

27:45.431 --> 27:47.765
THE FIRST SHOOTING--
THAT WAS PART OF THE GAME?

27:47.767 --> 27:51.301
Olivet:
HE BECAME PRETTY AGITATED
WHEN I BROUGHT IT UP.

27:51.303 --> 27:54.271
HE WAS PROBABLY TRAUMATIZED
BY THE INCIDENT.

27:54.273 --> 27:56.273
BUT NOT ENOUGH TO STAY AWAY

27:56.275 --> 27:57.441
FROM GUNS.

27:57.443 --> 28:00.911
BEST THING YOU CAN DO
IS PLEA IT OUT.

28:00.913 --> 28:04.314
MAKE RESIDENTIAL
PSYCHIATRIC CARE A CONDITION.

28:04.316 --> 28:06.817
Stone:
SIX MONTHS
OF DAY CARE?

28:06.819 --> 28:08.952
HE HAD TWO YEARS OF THERAPY.

28:08.954 --> 28:12.690
HE KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU PULL THE TRIGGER.

28:12.692 --> 28:14.058
HE DIDN'T CARE.

28:14.060 --> 28:15.793
YOU CANNOT MAKE THE CASE

28:15.795 --> 28:19.029
WITHOUT ENTERING
THE FIRST SHOOTING IN EVIDENCE.

28:19.031 --> 28:20.764
YOU GOT
A SEALED RECORD.

28:20.766 --> 28:22.466
YOU GOT
A JUVENILE OFFENDER.

28:22.468 --> 28:25.436
ANY JURY WOULD CONVICT
THIS BOY

28:25.438 --> 28:30.340
ON THE SECOND SHOOTING SOLELY
ON THE EVIDENCE FROM THE FIRST.

28:30.342 --> 28:33.377
JAMIE SAID HE SHOT ROBBIE
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T KNOW

28:33.379 --> 28:35.345
THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN A DOUBLE-ACTION

28:35.347 --> 28:37.381
AND SINGLE-ACTION
HANDGUN.

28:37.383 --> 28:39.383
THE CAMPBELL SHOOTING
DEMONSTRATES

28:39.385 --> 28:41.351
HE'D LEARNED THAT LESSON
TWO YEARS AGO

28:41.353 --> 28:42.720
WHEN HE CLAIMED

28:42.722 --> 28:44.354
TO HAVE MADE
THE SAME MISTAKE.

28:44.356 --> 28:48.058
TAKE A RUN AT JUDGE MARKMAN.

28:48.060 --> 28:51.829
JAMIE MASER SHOOTING
GRAHAM CAMPBELL AT AGE 13

28:51.831 --> 28:55.833
HAD TO HAVE BEEN THE SINGLE
MOST IMPORTANT INCIDENT

28:55.835 --> 28:57.835
IN THE BOY'S LIFE TO DATE.

28:57.837 --> 28:59.837
IF THAT IS NOT ADMITTED,
IT ALLOWS

28:59.839 --> 29:02.506
A DEFENSE CLAIM
THAT'S CLEARLY FRAUDULENT.

29:02.508 --> 29:03.741
YOUR HONOR

29:03.743 --> 29:04.975
IT'S IRRELEVANT.

29:04.977 --> 29:08.278
OUR DEFENSE ISN'T BASED
ON A CLAIM OF MISTAKE.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.514
Robinette:
BUT HE DID MAKE
THE STATEMENTS.

29:10.516 --> 29:12.983
THE INVESTIGATING OFFICERS
WILL TESTIFY

29:12.985 --> 29:15.986
JAMIE TOLD THEM
HE WAS CONFUSED ON THE GUN.

29:15.988 --> 29:17.988
THE PRIOR SHOOTING
SHOULD BE ADMITTED

29:17.990 --> 29:19.990
TO SHOW THAT
TO BE A LIE.

29:19.992 --> 29:22.860
UNDER A TECHNICAL APPLICATION
OF MOLINEAUX, YOU'RE RIGHT

29:22.862 --> 29:24.361
BUT I HAVE
TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

29:24.363 --> 29:27.397
THE IMPACT THIS PRIOR SHOOTING
WILL HAVE ON THE JURY

29:27.399 --> 29:29.099
AS I'M SURE
YOU DID.

29:29.101 --> 29:30.367
IN MY OPINION

29:30.369 --> 29:32.536
IT WAS SO INFLAMMATORY,
SO PREJUDICIAL

29:32.538 --> 29:35.072
IT WILL OUTWEIGH ITS VALUE
AS EVIDENCE.

29:37.109 --> 29:40.778
SO I CAN'T ALLOW IT
TO BE INTRODUCED.

29:45.451 --> 29:49.019
Jamie:
EVERYTHING WAS IN SLOW MOTION.

29:49.021 --> 29:52.489
IT WAS WEIRD.

29:52.491 --> 29:58.128
I FELT LIKE I WAS STANDING
OUTSIDE MY BODY...

29:58.130 --> 30:00.330
AND WATCHING.

30:00.332 --> 30:04.568
I MEAN, I COULD SEE ME...
AND, AND ROBBIE.

30:04.570 --> 30:06.570
LIKE IN A MOVIE.

30:08.507 --> 30:12.910
AND I WANTED TO SEE
HOW FAR THE TRIGGER WOULD GO.

30:12.912 --> 30:17.481
I WANTED TO SEE
WHAT ROBBIE WOULD DO.

30:17.483 --> 30:20.350
DID HE SAY ANYTHING TO YOU?

30:20.352 --> 30:25.022
I DON'T... I DON'T KNOW.

30:25.024 --> 30:27.891
IT WAS LIKE I WAS IN A BUBBLE.

30:27.893 --> 30:30.894
I COULDN'T HEAR.

30:30.896 --> 30:34.832
I JU... I JUST KEPT PULLING
THE TRIGGER, AND...

30:34.834 --> 30:36.567
THERE WAS THIS FLASH.

30:36.569 --> 30:38.168
Barnett:
WHEN THE GUN

30:38.170 --> 30:40.971
WENT OFF?

30:40.973 --> 30:43.974
I DON'T REMEMBER.

30:43.976 --> 30:46.410
I...

30:46.412 --> 30:49.947
THERE WAS ROBBIE
JUST LAYING THERE...

30:49.949 --> 30:51.215
BLEEDING...

30:51.217 --> 30:54.151
IT WAS LIKE THE MOVIE
WAS STILL GOING ON.

30:54.153 --> 30:56.420
I COULDN'T FEEL.

30:56.422 --> 31:02.125
I HEARD THIS ROARING SOUND
IN MY EARS.

31:02.127 --> 31:06.196
I JUST COULDN'T STOP WATCHING...

31:12.972 --> 31:15.873
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

31:15.875 --> 31:17.641
MR. STONE.

31:17.643 --> 31:20.410
NO QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME,
YOUR HONOR.

31:20.412 --> 31:22.512
SUBJECT TO RECALL.

31:23.649 --> 31:25.048
SINCE ITS INTRODUCTION

31:25.050 --> 31:27.251
TRACON HAS HAD
A FAVORABLE SUCCESS RATE

31:27.253 --> 31:29.419
BUT IT HAS ALSO GENERATED

31:29.421 --> 31:33.423
TEN TIMES MORE ADVERSE REACTION
REPORTS THAN SIMILAR DRUGS.

31:33.425 --> 31:35.626
WHAT KIND OF ADVERSE REACTIONS,
DOCTOR?

31:35.628 --> 31:37.961
NERVOUS SYSTEM DISTURBANCES--

31:37.963 --> 31:41.098
REBOUND ANXIETY

31:41.100 --> 31:44.534
AMNESIA, HOSTILITY, DELUSIONS.

31:44.536 --> 31:47.504
IT'S MY OPINION TRACON CAN
IGNITE REPRESSED ANGER.

31:47.506 --> 31:50.674
CAN YOU OFFER AN OPINION
ABOUT HIS EMOTIONAL STATE

31:50.676 --> 31:52.576
AT THE TIME OF THE SHOOTING?

31:52.578 --> 31:56.980
Doctor:
BASED ON HIS BEHAVIOR
SINCE BEING PRESCRIBED TRACON

31:56.982 --> 31:58.982
IT'S MY OPINION
JAMIE WAS SUFFERING

31:58.984 --> 32:01.018
FROM TRACON INTOXICATION
SYNDROME.

32:01.020 --> 32:02.286
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

32:02.288 --> 32:04.221
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

32:06.025 --> 32:10.560
DOCTOR, COULD YOU DESCRIBE
DISSOCIATIVE PHENOMENA?

32:10.562 --> 32:14.264
Doctor:
IT'S A FEELING
OF STANDING OUTSIDE ONESELF--

32:14.266 --> 32:18.035
OF BEING A WITNESS
TO SOMETHING HAPPENING TO YOU.

32:18.037 --> 32:19.937
Stone:
THAT SOUNDS VERY SIMILAR

32:19.939 --> 32:22.472
TO A SYMPTOM
OF TRACON INTOXICATION.

32:22.474 --> 32:23.473
YES.

32:23.475 --> 32:24.608
ISN'T IT TRUE

32:24.610 --> 32:26.276
THAT VICTIMS OF SEXUAL

32:26.278 --> 32:27.978
OR PSYCHOLOGICAL ABUSE

32:27.980 --> 32:29.980
ALSO SUFFER
FROM DISSOCIATIVE PHENOMENA?

32:29.982 --> 32:31.181
YES, THAT'S TRUE.

32:31.183 --> 32:34.217
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD

32:34.219 --> 32:36.053
OF REPETITION COMPULSION?

32:36.055 --> 32:37.321
YES.

32:37.323 --> 32:39.757
WOULD YOU DESCRIBE IT.

32:39.758 --> 32:42.192
IT'S THE NEED TO REPEATEDLY
ACT OUT AN INNER CONFLICT.

32:42.194 --> 32:44.194
Stone:
AN INNER CONFLICT THAT MAY STEM

32:44.196 --> 32:46.596
FROM PSYCHOLOGICAL ABUSE?

32:46.598 --> 32:48.565
YES, POSSIBLY, BUT...

32:48.567 --> 32:50.067
SUBJECT MAY BE

32:50.069 --> 32:52.970
FEEDING OFF
A SURROGATE FIGURE'S FEAR

32:52.972 --> 32:55.505
ENCOURAGING HIM
TO REENACT A SITUATION

32:55.507 --> 32:57.975
HE FOUND PLEASING
ONCE BEFORE?

32:57.977 --> 33:00.077
YOUR HONOR,
THE PROSECUTION'S QUESTIONS

33:00.079 --> 33:02.145
SEEM DESIGNED
TO ELICIT INFORMATION

33:02.147 --> 33:04.281
THAT IS<i> NOT</i> ADMISSIBLE HERE.

33:04.283 --> 33:05.716
WATCH YOUR STEP, MR. STONE.

33:05.718 --> 33:08.652
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS,
YOUR HONOR.

33:08.654 --> 33:12.089
Stone:
HOW OLD WERE YOU, JAMIE

33:12.091 --> 33:14.624
WHEN YOU FIRST LEARNED
TO SHOOT A HANDGUN?

33:14.626 --> 33:16.626
I WAS 11.

33:16.628 --> 33:18.328
MY, UH, FATHER TAUGHT ME

33:18.330 --> 33:21.164
HOW TO SHOOT
HIS TARGET PISTOL.

33:23.569 --> 33:25.702
IS THIS YOUR FATHER'S
TARGET PISTOL?

33:25.704 --> 33:28.238
Jamie:
YEAH.

33:29.174 --> 33:31.108
HOW DO YOU FIRE IT?

33:31.110 --> 33:33.243
DO YOU JUST
PULL THE TRIGGER?

33:33.245 --> 33:36.646
NO. YOU HAVE
TO COCK THE HAMMER FIRST.

33:36.648 --> 33:38.315
WOULD YOU SHOW ME.

33:38.317 --> 33:40.183
YOUR HONOR, OBJECTION.

33:41.220 --> 33:42.386
OVERRULED.

33:42.388 --> 33:45.355
GO ON, JAMIE.

33:47.559 --> 33:49.559
OKAY, WELL...

33:49.561 --> 33:53.030
YOU COCK THE HAMMER FIRST
WITH YOUR THUMB.

33:53.032 --> 33:55.165
THEN YOU JUST PULL THE TRIGGER.

33:58.037 --> 34:00.570
IS THAT DIFFERENT
FROM THIS GUN--

34:00.572 --> 34:03.173
THE ONE YOU SHOT ROBBIE WITH?

34:03.175 --> 34:04.274
YEAH.

34:04.276 --> 34:06.143
HOW'S IT DIFFERENT?

34:06.145 --> 34:09.379
THAT ONE, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO COCK THE HAMMER FIRST.

34:09.381 --> 34:11.314
YOU JUST PULL THE TRIGGER.

34:11.316 --> 34:12.816
WOULD YOU SHOW ME.

34:15.788 --> 34:19.222
WHO TAUGHT YOU
TO HOLD THE GUN LIKE THAT?

34:19.224 --> 34:21.124
MY DAD.

34:21.126 --> 34:23.160
SO HOW DID IT FEEL

34:23.162 --> 34:25.228
POINTING A GUN AT YOUR FRIEND?

34:25.230 --> 34:27.164
IT WAS A GAME.
OH, IT'S FUN?

34:27.166 --> 34:29.299
SO IT WAS A GAME

34:29.301 --> 34:31.301
POINTING A GUN
AT YOUR FRIEND.

34:31.303 --> 34:34.104
WAS SQUEEZING THE TRIGGER
PART OF THE GAME?

34:34.106 --> 34:35.205
YEAH.

34:35.207 --> 34:36.840
COULD YOU SHOW ME?

34:36.842 --> 34:38.775
UM...

34:38.777 --> 34:40.744
PLEASE?

34:40.746 --> 34:43.213
YOU PULLED
THE TRIGGER VERY SLOWLY

34:43.215 --> 34:45.348
AND THE HAMMER
CAME BACK, RIGHT?

34:45.350 --> 34:47.651
DID YOU SEE IT MOVING?

34:47.653 --> 34:49.119
I DON'T REMEMBER.

34:49.121 --> 34:51.121
ROBBIE
SEE IT MOVING?
I DON'T KNOW.

34:51.123 --> 34:52.722
DID HE SAY ANYTHING
AT ALL?

34:52.724 --> 34:53.857
NO.

34:53.859 --> 34:56.426
SO YOU KEPT PULLING
THE TRIGGER, RIGHT?

34:56.428 --> 34:57.861
YEAH.

34:57.863 --> 34:59.729
YOU HELD IT ON HIM
THE WHOLE TIME?

34:59.731 --> 35:00.730
YEAH.

35:00.732 --> 35:02.332
HOW DID YOU FEEL?

35:02.334 --> 35:03.467
I DON'T KNOW.

35:03.469 --> 35:06.103
HOW DID ROBBIE FEEL?
WAS HE AFRAID?

35:06.105 --> 35:07.404
I DON'T KNOW.
(<i> hammer clicks</i> )

35:11.276 --> 35:13.677
IT... THIS ISN'T FAIR.

35:13.679 --> 35:15.378
IT WAS JUST A GAME.

35:15.380 --> 35:17.314
IT WASN'T LIKE THIS.

35:17.316 --> 35:19.883
WE... WE DIDN'T KNOW.

35:19.885 --> 35:22.285
IT'S... IT'S MY MEDICINE.

35:22.287 --> 35:23.253
SEE...

35:23.255 --> 35:24.855
MOVE TO STRIKE, YOUR HONOR.

35:24.857 --> 35:26.723
IT MAKES ME CONFUSED.

35:26.725 --> 35:28.325
Judge:
JURY WILL DISREGARD.

35:45.210 --> 35:46.910
MADAM FOREMAN

35:46.912 --> 35:49.379
HAS THE JURY REACHED
THE UNANIMOUS DECISION?

35:49.381 --> 35:51.248
YES, WE HAVE, YOUR HONOR.

35:51.250 --> 35:53.150
HOW DID YOU FIND?

35:53.152 --> 35:55.185
ON THE SOLE COUNT
OF THE INDICTMENT--

35:55.187 --> 35:56.887
MURDER IN THE SECOND DEGREE--

35:56.889 --> 36:01.158
WE FIND THE DEFENDANT,
JAMIE MASER, NOT GUILTY

36:01.160 --> 36:03.360
BY REASON OF MENTAL DEFECT.

36:08.167 --> 36:09.266
GOOD BOY.

36:09.268 --> 36:10.767
GOOD JOB.

36:10.769 --> 36:12.335
WAY TO GO.

36:12.337 --> 36:13.904
THANK YOU.

36:20.379 --> 36:23.380
PULL EVERYTHING YOU CAN
ON THE FIRST SHOOTING.

36:23.382 --> 36:25.415
GET THE RECORD UNSEALED.

36:25.417 --> 36:27.384
WE'LL REOPEN
THE INVESTIGATION.

36:27.386 --> 36:29.352
IT'S A TWO-YEAR-OLD
CASE, BEN.

36:29.354 --> 36:32.389
THERE'S NO STATUTE
OF LIMITATIONS ON MURDER.

36:36.528 --> 36:38.295
THE KID LIVES ON FEAR.

36:38.297 --> 36:40.530
CONVICTING HIM
ON THE FIRST SHOOTING

36:40.532 --> 36:43.433
WILL BE TWICE AS HARD
AS THE LAST ONE--

36:43.435 --> 36:46.536
A TWO-YEAR-OLD CASE,
LESS EVIDENCE TO WORK WITH

36:46.538 --> 36:50.674
AND YOU CAN'T USE THE FACT
IT MATCHES THE FENWICK SHOOTING

36:50.676 --> 36:52.442
BECAUSE THAT SHOOTING

36:52.444 --> 36:54.544
HAS NOT EVEN
TAKEN PLACE.

36:54.546 --> 36:57.614
I'M OPEN FOR SUGGESTIONS.

36:58.984 --> 37:01.418
NOTHING OUT OF THE PARENTS?

37:01.420 --> 37:04.254
THEY'RE BOUND BY THE TERMS
OF THE DIVORCE.

37:04.256 --> 37:06.623
WE KNOW THE FATHER LIED
ABOUT JAMIE'S

37:06.625 --> 37:07.757
KNOWLEDGE OF GUNS.

37:07.759 --> 37:09.259
TWO BOYS DEAD.

37:09.261 --> 37:11.261
NOT AN OUNCE OF GUILT.

37:11.263 --> 37:12.362
WE'LL FIND SOMETHING.

37:12.364 --> 37:14.297
WITH THE CASE SEALED?

37:14.299 --> 37:15.765
CERRETA AND LOGAN
HAVE NOTES

37:15.767 --> 37:17.601
FROM THE FIRST DETECTIVE.

37:17.603 --> 37:21.404
YOU BETTER WALK THROUGH IT
THEN.

37:21.406 --> 37:23.640
GRAHAM CAMPBELL
WAS FOUND RIGHT HERE.

37:23.642 --> 37:27.277
THE POSITION OF THE BODY
INDICATES HE WAS KNEELING

37:27.279 --> 37:28.411
WHEN HE WAS SHOT.

37:28.413 --> 37:30.647
JAMIE MUST HAVE BEEN
ABOUT RIGHT HERE.

37:30.649 --> 37:34.417
THERE WEREN'T ANY POWDER BURNS
ON GRAHAM EITHER, SO...

37:34.419 --> 37:36.253
Cerreta:
THAT WAS DISCOUNTED.

37:36.255 --> 37:37.587
GULLIKSON SAID IT RAINED

37:37.589 --> 37:39.623
THE DAY
THEY FOUND THE BODY.

37:39.625 --> 37:41.725
BUT ASSUMING
THERE WAS NO RESIDUE

37:41.727 --> 37:42.859
TO BEGIN WITH...

37:42.861 --> 37:45.462
THAT WOULD PUT JAMIE
FAR ENOUGH AWAY

37:45.464 --> 37:47.731
TO MAKE AN ACCIDENT
VERY UNLIKELY.

37:47.733 --> 37:50.467
SAME GAME, SAME EXCUSE.

37:50.469 --> 37:52.335
ONE SHOT TO THE HEAD

37:52.337 --> 37:55.605
BOTH TIMES FIRED
FROM SIX FEET AWAY.

37:55.607 --> 37:57.841
ANY TAKERS
ON COINCIDENCE?

37:59.044 --> 38:02.545
YOU TAUGHT JAMIE TO FIRE
A SINGLE-ACTION HANDGUN

38:02.547 --> 38:03.546
WHEN HE WAS 12.

38:03.548 --> 38:05.282
YES,
AT A FIRING RANGE.

38:05.284 --> 38:08.585
AND THE DOUBLE-ACTION HANDGUN
HE USED TWO YEARS AGO--

38:08.587 --> 38:10.754
YOU TAUGHT HIM
TO SHOOT THAT TOO?

38:10.756 --> 38:12.522
NO. I TOLD YOU BEFORE

38:12.524 --> 38:16.593
I ONLY WANTED HIM INTERESTED
IN TARGET SHOOTING.

38:16.595 --> 38:18.662
WHAT IS THIS, NET FISHING?

38:18.664 --> 38:20.730
IT'S ABOUT
YOUR CLIENT LYING

38:20.732 --> 38:22.432
TO PROTECT HIS SON.

38:22.434 --> 38:25.068
HE LIED ABOUT JAMIE'S
KNOWLEDGE OF GUNS

38:25.070 --> 38:26.636
IN THE FENWICK SHOOTING.

38:26.638 --> 38:28.772
HE MAY HAVE TOLD
THE SAME LIE

38:28.774 --> 38:30.607
IN THE CAMPBELL
SHOOTING.

38:30.609 --> 38:31.775
AND?

38:31.777 --> 38:33.376
PERJURY IS A FELONY.

38:33.378 --> 38:35.612
IT CARRIES SOME TIME.

38:35.614 --> 38:37.847
I DON'T RESPOND
TO THREATS, MR. STONE.

38:37.849 --> 38:39.416
TWO BOYS ARE DEAD

38:39.418 --> 38:42.085
AND I HOLD YOU
GREATLY RESPONSIBLE--

38:42.087 --> 38:45.922
IF NOT LEGALLY, ETHICALLY--
FOR BOTH THOSE DEATHS.

38:45.924 --> 38:48.525
THAT'S ONE
OF THE GREAT THINGS

38:48.527 --> 38:50.093
ABOUT THIS COUNTRY.

38:50.095 --> 38:52.862
YOU CAN BELIEVE
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

38:59.471 --> 39:02.439
IT'S GOING TO TAKE MORE
THAN AN "E" FELONY

39:02.441 --> 39:04.574
TO LEVERAGE ANYTHING
OUT OF HIM.

39:04.576 --> 39:06.676
FIND OUT WHERE
HE DID HIS SHOOTING

39:06.678 --> 39:08.178
TWO YEARS AGO

39:08.179 --> 39:09.679
AND GET US IN
TO SEE PAMELA MASER

39:09.681 --> 39:10.747
AND HER LAWYER.

39:19.558 --> 39:21.608
HERE HE IS.

39:21.609 --> 39:23.659
IAN MASER WAS A MEMBER
TILL TWO YEARS AGO.

39:23.662 --> 39:24.828
THINK HE MOVED.

39:24.830 --> 39:26.963
HIS CREDIT CARD RECEIPTS SHOW

39:26.965 --> 39:29.666
HE HAD BEEN COMING HERE
FOR SIX YEARS.

39:29.668 --> 39:31.601
HIS KID WAS A MEMBER TOO.

39:31.603 --> 39:33.636
YOU GIVE MEMBERSHIPS TO KIDS?

39:33.638 --> 39:35.538
IT'S A PROMOTIONAL THING.

39:35.540 --> 39:38.608
KIDS LIKE HAVING
THEIR OWN MEMBERSHIP CARDS.

39:38.610 --> 39:41.411
THEY CAN'T SHOOT
WITHOUT THEIR PARENTS.

39:41.413 --> 39:43.513
MASER BRING HIS SON
IN OFTEN?

39:43.515 --> 39:44.914
I DON'T RECALL
HOW OFTEN.

39:44.916 --> 39:47.650
MASER KEPT
A TARGET PISTOL HERE.

39:47.652 --> 39:48.651
I REMEMBER HIM

39:48.653 --> 39:50.754
TEACHING THE KID
HOW TO DO IT.

39:50.756 --> 39:52.389
I USED TO HEAR HIM

39:52.391 --> 39:53.890
HOLLER AT HIM
ALL THE TIME.

39:53.892 --> 39:55.892
MASER EVER FIRE OTHER GUNS?

39:55.894 --> 39:59.462
I SEE WHERE HE STARTED
BUYING .357 AMMO

39:59.464 --> 40:00.697
BEFORE HE MOVED...

40:00.699 --> 40:01.831
OH, YEAH...

40:01.833 --> 40:05.468
AND THEN HE GOT HIMSELF
A COLT PYTHON.

40:05.470 --> 40:07.837
IT WAS PRETTY FUNNY
FOR A WHILE.

40:07.839 --> 40:08.972
WHAT WAS?

40:08.974 --> 40:10.707
THE COLT IS A BIG GUN.

40:10.709 --> 40:12.475
SEEING THAT YOUNG KID

40:12.477 --> 40:14.944
TRYING TO KEEP A BEAD
ON THE TARGET.

40:17.516 --> 40:20.683
I NEVER HAD ANYTHING TO DO
WITH THE GUNS.

40:20.685 --> 40:22.852
THAT WAS BETWEEN IAN AND JAMIE.

40:22.854 --> 40:24.621
JAMIE NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT?

40:24.623 --> 40:27.690
HE'D TELL ME
IF HE'D PLEASED HIS FATHER

40:27.692 --> 40:29.526
BUT SPECIFICALLY, NO.

40:29.528 --> 40:31.628
YOUR HUSBAND
NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT?

40:31.630 --> 40:33.763
THE GUNS
WERE MALE BUSINESS.

40:33.765 --> 40:36.666
IAN ASSUMED
I WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND

40:36.668 --> 40:37.901
WHICH WASN'T TRUE

40:37.903 --> 40:40.203
OR THAT I DIDN'T WANT
TO KNOW

40:40.205 --> 40:41.671
WHICH<i> WAS</i> TRUE.

40:41.673 --> 40:44.607
Stone:
YOU SEPARATED
NOT LONG AFTER

40:44.609 --> 40:46.009
THE FIRST SHOOTING
INCIDENT.

40:46.011 --> 40:47.677
IS THAT CORRECT?

40:47.679 --> 40:50.480
IS THAT BECAUSE
OF THE GUNS?

40:53.652 --> 40:55.718
OR THE SHOOTING?

40:55.720 --> 40:58.588
OR THE WAY
YOUR HUSBAND
TREATS JAMIE?

40:58.590 --> 41:00.690
SHAKY GROUND,
MR. STONE.

41:00.692 --> 41:03.726
YOU KNOW
THAT INFORMATION IS SEALED.

41:03.728 --> 41:07.931
WHAT I KNOW, SEALED OR NOT,
IS THAT TWO BOYS ARE DEAD

41:07.933 --> 41:09.866
AND YOUR SON
MAY OR MAY NOT

41:09.868 --> 41:11.968
HAVE BEEN
IRREPARABLY DAMAGED

41:11.970 --> 41:14.671
BY HIS RELATIONSHIP
WITH HIS FATHER.

41:14.673 --> 41:17.974
I THINK YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO

41:17.976 --> 41:20.610
THAT NO MATTER
WHAT THE SETTLEMENT

41:20.612 --> 41:22.479
OR THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT

41:22.481 --> 41:24.714
IT CAN'T BE ANYWHERE NEAR
WORTH IT.

41:30.722 --> 41:34.491
Mrs. Maser:
<i> IAN WASN'T AN EASY MAN</i>
<i> TO LIVE WITH.</i>

41:34.493 --> 41:38.094
THINGS WERE HIS WAY OR NO WAY

41:38.096 --> 41:42.031
AND IF THEY WEREN'T HIS WAY,
JAMIE OR I PAID FOR IT.

41:43.101 --> 41:45.835
AFTER GRAHAM CAMPBELL WAS SHOT

41:45.837 --> 41:49.038
THINGS GOT WAY OUT OF HAND.

41:49.040 --> 41:51.641
OUT OF HAND?

41:51.643 --> 41:53.643
ANYTHING WOULD SET IAN OFF.

41:53.645 --> 41:54.644
ANYTHING.

41:54.646 --> 41:57.647
JAMIE WAS OUT OF CONTROL.

41:57.649 --> 42:00.917
IAN AND I SEPARATED
AND JAMIE CAME TO LIVE WITH ME.

42:00.919 --> 42:03.286
HE STARTED TAKING THINGS OUT
ON ME--

42:03.288 --> 42:04.854
ACTING LIKE HIS FATHER.

42:04.856 --> 42:06.623
IN WHAT WAY?

42:06.625 --> 42:08.858
HE THREATENED ME.

42:08.860 --> 42:11.294
WITH WHAT?

42:11.296 --> 42:14.114
A GUN.

42:14.115 --> 42:16.933
Stone:
AND DID YOU KEEP A GUN
IN THE APARTMENT?

42:16.935 --> 42:19.736
NO. IT WAS ONE OF IAN'S.

42:19.738 --> 42:23.106
I DON'T KNOW
IF IT WAS LOADED OR NOT.

42:23.108 --> 42:25.542
HE POINTED IT AT ME.

42:25.544 --> 42:27.944
I MUST HAVE LOOKED BLANK
OR SOMETHING.

42:27.946 --> 42:29.012
HE SAID...

42:30.849 --> 42:33.850
"YOU DON'T BELIEVE I'D DO IT,
DO YOU?

42:33.852 --> 42:36.819
GRAHAM DIDN'T BELIEVE ME
EITHER."

42:39.624 --> 42:43.960
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO BE AFRAID OF YOUR OWN SON.

42:52.103 --> 42:54.037
"YOU DON'T BELIEVE
I'D DO IT"

42:54.039 --> 42:56.739
AND "GRAHAM DIDN'T
BELIEVE IT EITHER."

42:56.741 --> 42:59.642
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT JAMIE MEAN BY THAT?

42:59.644 --> 43:02.679
GRAHAM DIDN'T BELIEVE
JAMIE WOULD SHOOT HIM.

43:02.681 --> 43:06.583
DID YOU BELIEVE
HE'D SHOOT YOU?

43:07.652 --> 43:09.586
I DID.

43:10.622 --> 43:13.656
UNDER THE TERMS
OF YOUR DIVORCE SETTLEMENT

43:13.658 --> 43:16.626
YOU HAVE BEEN FORBIDDEN
TO MAKE ANY MENTION

43:16.628 --> 43:18.628
OF THE GRAHAM CAMPBELL
INCIDENT

43:18.630 --> 43:19.629
IS THAT TRUE?

43:19.631 --> 43:20.630
YES.

43:20.632 --> 43:22.699
YET HERE YOU ARE
TESTIFYING.

43:22.701 --> 43:24.100
WHY IS THAT?

43:24.102 --> 43:25.835
I GAVE UP EVERYTHING.

43:25.837 --> 43:27.837
I GAVE UP CUSTODY OF MY SON

43:27.839 --> 43:31.741
AND NOW I'M FORFEITING
ANY FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT

43:31.743 --> 43:33.710
BY TESTIFYING.

43:33.711 --> 43:35.678
THE ONLY CONDITION I PUT
ON THE DIVORCE

43:35.680 --> 43:37.714
WAS THAT JAMIE RECEIVE THERAPY

43:37.716 --> 43:39.849
TO HELP HIM DEAL
WITH THE SHOOTING

43:39.851 --> 43:41.851
AND HIS SUBSEQUENT BEHAVIOR.

43:41.853 --> 43:44.754
OBVIOUSLY
THAT HASN'T BEEN ENOUGH.

43:44.756 --> 43:47.440
A SECOND BOY IS DEAD

43:47.441 --> 43:50.125
AND I COULDN'T LIVE WITH MYSELF
IF I LET THAT GO BY

43:50.128 --> 43:52.095
AND DID NOTHING ABOUT IT.

43:52.097 --> 43:55.732
ARE YOU AWARE
OF THE CONSEQUENCES

43:55.734 --> 43:58.735
OF YOUR TESTIFYING TODAY?

43:58.737 --> 44:03.640
I KNOW THAT JAMIE COULD GO
TO SPOFFORD JUVENILE HALL

44:03.642 --> 44:07.043
AND AFTER THAT, MAYBE PRISON.

44:07.045 --> 44:09.245
I JUST...

44:10.782 --> 44:15.985
LEAVING HIM WITH HIS FATHER
JUST DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT NOW.

44:22.060 --> 44:25.895
JAMIE NEVER FIRED THAT GUN.

44:25.897 --> 44:27.730
EARLIER WE HEARD TESTIMONY

44:27.732 --> 44:29.999
FROM THE OWNER
OF THE FIRING RANGE

44:30.001 --> 44:31.167
THAT HE SAW YOU

44:31.169 --> 44:34.203
TEACH JAMIE TO SHOOT
A COLT PYTHON .357.

44:34.205 --> 44:37.273
WHY WOULD HE FABRICATE
A STORY LIKE THAT?

44:37.275 --> 44:39.742
I WAS IN THE BOOTH WITH MY SON.

44:39.744 --> 44:41.444
I KNOW WHICH GUN HE USED.

44:41.446 --> 44:44.747
THIS IS AN INDIVIDUAL
WHO HAS NOTHING TO GAIN

44:44.749 --> 44:47.884
FROM LYING ABOUT SEEING
YOUR SON SHOOT A .357.

44:47.886 --> 44:52.021
WHY WOULD HE CONCOCT A MEMORY
ABOUT A SMALL BOY FIRING A GUN

44:52.023 --> 44:53.856
TOO BIG FOR HIM TO SHOOT?

44:53.858 --> 44:56.125
I CAN'T ADDRESS THIN MOTIVES.

44:56.127 --> 44:57.794
WHAT ABOUT YOUR OWN?

44:57.796 --> 44:58.895
OBJECTION.

44:58.897 --> 45:00.797
SUSTAINED.

45:04.235 --> 45:06.803
I HAVE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

45:06.805 --> 45:11.708
I KNOW MY SON WOULD NOT
WILLFULLY KILL THAT BOY.

45:11.710 --> 45:13.776
I TAUGHT HIM RIGHT FROM WRONG.

45:13.778 --> 45:15.778
I AM HIS FATHER.

45:15.780 --> 45:18.147
EVERYTHING HE LEARNED

45:18.149 --> 45:19.782
EVERYTHING HE IS...

45:19.784 --> 45:20.917
Judge:
MR. MASER.

45:22.887 --> 45:24.987
YOU MAY STEP DOWN.

45:35.900 --> 45:38.301
ON THE SOLE COUNT
OF THE INDICTMENT--

45:38.303 --> 45:41.904
MURDER IN THE SECOND DEGREE--
HOW DOES THE JURY FIND?

45:41.906 --> 45:43.840
WE FIND THE DEFENDANT

45:43.842 --> 45:45.975
JAMIE MASER-- GUILTY.

45:54.319 --> 45:55.985
JAMIE...

46:19.177 --> 46:21.844
DIDN'T HAVE
A LOT OF CHOICES.

46:21.846 --> 46:25.815
I'M SURE PAMELA MASER
IS TURNING HERSELF AROUND

46:25.817 --> 46:27.183
WITH THAT SAME THOUGHT.

46:27.185 --> 46:29.318
SHE'S TOUGH.

46:29.320 --> 46:31.053
MAYBE...

46:31.055 --> 46:33.923
OR MAYBE SHE JUST GAVE IN.

46:33.925 --> 46:35.925
DID THE INEVITABLE.

46:35.927 --> 46:38.327
THINK YOU COULD HAVE
DONE IT?

46:38.329 --> 46:40.713
GIVE UP MY CHILD?

46:40.714 --> 46:43.098
NOT WITHOUT RIPPING MYSELF
IN HALF, I COULDN'T.
