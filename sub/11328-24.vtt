WEBVTT

00:02.073 --> 00:04.074
- So about John...
- You gonna take him on the weekends?

00:04.108 --> 00:06.376
This is something that you
and Ricky need to work out on your own.

00:06.410 --> 00:09.612
Ricky's not gonna get John.
If you don't give Ricky what
he wants, he'll go to court.

00:09.646 --> 00:12.114
Have you ever seen my bedroom?
[chuckles]

00:12.148 --> 00:16.264
We wanna get to know John,
and we wanna make sure
he gets to know us.

00:16.299 --> 00:19.386
Probably the best thing
is for you to get
a mediation.

00:19.421 --> 00:21.407
I might wanna
have real sex

00:21.441 --> 00:23.386
after Betty
and Leo's wedding.

00:23.420 --> 00:25.693
Are we thinking
about having sex?
We are.

00:25.728 --> 00:27.047
Are you excited
about the wedding?

00:27.098 --> 00:28.548
Of course. You're gonna
be there, right?

00:28.582 --> 00:31.045
After all you've done for me,
I wouldn't miss it for anything.

00:31.079 --> 00:33.651
I don't wanna
be friends with you.
Not just friends.

00:33.685 --> 00:35.571
I'm wrong,
and he's right.

00:35.606 --> 00:37.727
Ricky should be able
to take John on the weekends.

00:37.761 --> 00:38.804
Very good decision.

00:38.838 --> 00:40.182
That was the right thing
to do.

00:40.216 --> 00:42.381
And now I don't get to have John
on his first birthday.

00:42.415 --> 00:43.292
You'll work it out.

00:43.326 --> 00:45.279
You and I can plan
the party together.

00:45.313 --> 00:47.430
You can get birth control pills
at the free clinic,

00:47.464 --> 00:49.882
but I suggest
you ask your mother.

00:49.916 --> 00:54.726
You have to be on the pill
at least a month before
they really get started.

00:54.760 --> 00:57.209
I hope that's why I'm late.

01:01.006 --> 01:03.187
[phone ringing]

01:05.810 --> 01:08.596
<i>Hi. What do you need?
[Ricky]
I don't need anything.</i>

01:08.631 --> 01:11.277
I just thought we should talk
about John's birthday party.

01:11.311 --> 01:13.157
[scoffs]
How much do we need
to talk about it?

01:13.191 --> 01:16.582
It's just your family
and my family at the park
tomorrow afternoon around 5,

01:16.616 --> 01:18.728
and then after the party,
you take him home.

01:18.762 --> 01:21.106
<i>Mom's making a birthday cake,
and you're doing
everything else.</i>

01:21.140 --> 01:22.478
Okay. Like what?

01:22.517 --> 01:24.389
Like bringing food
for everyone.

01:24.423 --> 01:25.867
What kind of food?

01:25.901 --> 01:27.372
Just get some wings.

01:27.407 --> 01:29.416
Chicken wings?
Do you want beer with that?

01:29.450 --> 01:31.393
What?
Wings?

01:31.427 --> 01:33.908
I love wings.
Don't you know I love wings?

01:33.942 --> 01:36.452
No. And I the think
the question is,
does John love wings?

01:36.486 --> 01:39.300
<i>It's his birthday.
Wouldn't he choke?
Fine.</i>

01:39.334 --> 01:41.410
Uh, nuggets. I have to go.

01:41.444 --> 01:42.952
<i>I'm trying to be nice here</i>

01:42.987 --> 01:44.458
and include you
in planning the party.

01:44.492 --> 01:45.767
Why are you rushing
off the phone?

01:45.801 --> 01:47.876
Because I have to
get John to bed.

01:47.910 --> 01:49.114
He's not in bed yet?

01:49.148 --> 01:50.619
No. Do you have
a problem with that?

01:50.656 --> 01:52.628
No, I don't.
But his birthday
is tomorrow,

01:52.666 --> 01:54.403
so I hope he gets
plenty of sleep.

01:54.437 --> 01:56.012
I just want everything
to be right.

01:56.046 --> 01:58.691
I never had a birthday party
until I lived
with my foster parents.

01:59.930 --> 02:01.903
I don't know a lot
about this stuff.

02:01.938 --> 02:03.542
<i>It doesn't have to be
anything fancy.</i>

02:03.576 --> 02:06.554
It's not as much for him
as it is for us and our parents.

02:06.588 --> 02:09.666
Celebrating his first birthday
and getting through
this first year together.

02:09.703 --> 02:11.307
<i>He won't even remember it,</i>

02:11.341 --> 02:13.281
but we will, so...

02:13.315 --> 02:14.685
I don't know.

02:14.723 --> 02:16.929
Bring some sandwiches
from the deli.

02:16.964 --> 02:18.770
<i>Some chips,
maybe some balloons.</i>

02:18.804 --> 02:21.110
Yeah, get some balloons.
He loves balloons.

02:21.144 --> 02:23.483
<i>Yeah. And we'll just
hang out for a bit,
and that's it.</i>

02:23.517 --> 02:26.226
After the park,
you'll take him home and have
your first weekend together.

02:26.261 --> 02:29.137
Not a big deal.
Taking him the first weekend
isn't a big deal?

02:29.171 --> 02:32.213
His birthday.
John's first birthday
is not a big deal?

02:32.247 --> 02:35.223
Well, it's a big deal,
but it's not that big of a deal.

02:35.257 --> 02:36.995
I'm surprised
you feel that way.

02:37.030 --> 02:39.068
And I'm happy
you feel that way, Amy.

02:39.102 --> 02:41.240
I'm glad I called you.
I feel a lot better.

02:41.274 --> 02:43.479
The pressure's off.
Thanks.

02:43.514 --> 02:45.921
You're welcome.
See you tomorrow at the park.

02:45.955 --> 02:47.524
All right, Amy.
Good night.

02:47.559 --> 02:49.330
<i>Good night.</i>

02:49.364 --> 02:51.269
Good night.

02:51.303 --> 02:52.505
John.

02:52.540 --> 02:53.978
[phone clatters]

02:54.012 --> 02:55.648
[sighs]

02:57.455 --> 02:59.360
It's just me and you, kid.

02:59.394 --> 03:01.032
Me and you.

03:01.066 --> 03:03.171
All right. So what
no one knows is this:

03:03.206 --> 03:08.086
You and I are gonna have
your birthday party
right now.

03:08.121 --> 03:10.726
It was a year ago
that you started making
your way here,

03:10.760 --> 03:13.033
so I figured,
why not?

03:13.067 --> 03:16.174
And any time that Daddy
has you on a birthday

03:16.208 --> 03:19.181
or a holiday,
we'll have our party
the night before.

03:19.216 --> 03:22.858
You wanna do that?
All right.

03:24.830 --> 03:27.099
I know. Okay, we're gonna
blow it out. Ready?

03:27.133 --> 03:29.034
One, two, three.

03:30.370 --> 03:33.141
Whoa. Yay.
[clapping]

03:33.176 --> 03:34.410
Okay. Ready?

03:34.445 --> 03:35.412
[camera shutter clicks]

03:35.446 --> 03:37.148
[laughs]

03:37.183 --> 03:39.153
Okay, you wanna open
your present, huh?

03:39.188 --> 03:42.427
You wanna open
your present from Mama?

03:42.462 --> 03:45.201
All right.

03:45.235 --> 03:47.539
[shutter clicking]

03:53.854 --> 03:56.393
<i>"Falling in love,</i>

03:56.428 --> 03:59.601
<i>"Is such an easy thing to do.</i>

03:59.635 --> 04:02.174
<i>"Birds can do it,
We can do it,</i>

04:02.208 --> 04:04.646
<i>"Let's stop talking
Let's get to it,</i>

04:04.680 --> 04:07.080
<i>"Let's fall in love."</i>

04:14.315 --> 04:16.048
Amy.

04:18.781 --> 04:20.814
Hey, I just saw John
in the nursery.

04:20.848 --> 04:22.646
Why does he have on a suit?

04:22.680 --> 04:24.544
It's his birthday.

04:24.578 --> 04:26.944
We got up early
and then fell asleep.

04:26.978 --> 04:28.378
Are you gonna have him
dressed up all day?

04:28.412 --> 04:29.478
Why not?

04:29.513 --> 04:31.246
What was on his face?

04:31.281 --> 04:33.348
Are you okay?

04:33.382 --> 04:35.483
You look funny.

04:35.518 --> 04:38.920
It's Mimsy.
Her nurse ju called.

04:38.954 --> 04:41.221
They think she might've
suffered a small stroke
last night.

04:41.256 --> 04:43.223
I have to go up there, Amy.
I don't know if I'm

04:43.257 --> 04:45.624
gonna be able to get back
this afternoon, but I'll try.

04:45.659 --> 04:49.294
Wait. Try, Mom?
It's John's first birthday.
I know, Amy. I know.

04:49.328 --> 04:51.228
Wait. What was on his face?

04:51.263 --> 04:52.830
Uh, breakfast.

04:52.864 --> 04:56.299
Really? 'Cause it looked
more like cake...with frosting.

04:56.333 --> 04:58.033
Okay, you got me.

04:58.067 --> 04:59.901
It was a cupcake.
I gave him a cupcake.

04:59.935 --> 05:02.369
[scoffs]
Amy, did you wake up
this morning,

05:02.404 --> 05:05.672
and have a birthday party
with John all by yourself,
just the two of you?

05:05.706 --> 05:09.374
No. Not exactly.
What if we did?

05:09.408 --> 05:11.075
Well, then, I guess
the rest of us

05:11.109 --> 05:13.743
who went through his first year
with you missed it.

05:13.778 --> 05:17.145
But if that's what you wanted--
you're his mother,
so I guess that's how it is.

05:17.180 --> 05:19.814
Well, that's not what I wanted.
You know what I wanted.

05:19.848 --> 05:21.682
I wanted him to be here
with me this weekend

05:21.716 --> 05:23.684
when it was his birthday.

05:23.718 --> 05:26.919
I didn't know you were gonna
miss the real party--
the one at the park.

05:26.953 --> 05:30.221
Mimsy had a stroke, Amy.
At least they think
that she did.

05:30.256 --> 05:32.656
I have to go to her.
She's in the hospital.
She's my mother.

05:32.691 --> 05:35.024
Well, if she's in the hospital,
she's being taken care of.

05:35.059 --> 05:37.426
You can't wait until tomorrow?
No, I can't.

05:37.460 --> 05:40.762
If you wanted me at the party,
then maybe you could've included
me in the one you just had.

05:40.796 --> 05:43.163
I just said I didn't know
you were leaving,

05:43.197 --> 05:45.798
otherwise maybe I would've.
"Maybe," huh, Amy?

05:45.832 --> 05:48.666
What happened to the girl
last week who stood up
and did the right thing?

05:48.701 --> 05:50.201
Where is she?
I wouldn't have stood up

05:50.235 --> 05:52.836
if I had known that Ricky
would get John for his birthday.

05:52.870 --> 05:54.370
This is completely unfair.

05:54.404 --> 05:57.205
Well, life's not always fair,
Amy, but I guess you know that.

05:57.239 --> 06:00.073
I have to go.
I have to.

06:00.108 --> 06:03.776
Wait. I hope Mimsy's okay.

06:04.877 --> 06:06.711
I really do.

06:06.746 --> 06:08.613
Thanks.

06:08.647 --> 06:12.116
Okay, I'm just gonna go put
a few things in the bag
in case we have to stay.

06:12.150 --> 06:14.284
Wait, wait.
"We" as in you
and Robbie, right?

06:14.318 --> 06:16.518
Dad's not going up there
with you, is he?

06:16.553 --> 06:18.753
Mom, I don't wanna go
to the party with just Ashley.

06:18.788 --> 06:20.922
Amy, you know how much
Mimsy loves your dad.

06:20.956 --> 06:23.957
Yeah. And I know how much
Dad loves his grandson.

06:23.992 --> 06:25.625
I thought I did.

06:25.660 --> 06:27.493
Mom, it's John's
first birthday.

06:27.528 --> 06:29.094
I know, Amy. I know.

06:29.129 --> 06:32.164
It's lousy timing,
but I can't help it.
I can't.

06:32.198 --> 06:34.366
Can't Dad stay up there
and let you come home?

06:34.400 --> 06:35.834
Amy, she's my mother!

06:35.868 --> 06:37.168
Yeah, I know,
but I'm your daughter.

06:37.202 --> 06:39.237
Look, this is difficult
enough as it is, Amy.

06:39.271 --> 06:40.371
Don't make it harder.

06:40.406 --> 06:42.574
[scoffs]

06:44.309 --> 06:45.810
Hey, kiddo.
Your mom got a call.

06:45.844 --> 06:47.778
The nurse thinks Mimsy
might've had a stroke.

06:47.813 --> 06:49.480
We don't know for sure,
so we gotta drive up there.

06:49.514 --> 06:51.182
We may have to miss
John's birthday party.

06:51.216 --> 06:53.550
It's probably nothing.
So I don't have to
go to school?

06:53.585 --> 06:56.586
Not "we" as the entire family,
just "we" as in your mother
and me.

06:56.620 --> 06:58.620
Oh, isn't the divorce
part of the family?

06:58.654 --> 07:01.488
Not my doing.
Yeah, I know.

07:01.522 --> 07:04.857
Uh, look, do you mind
if I go on the pill?

07:04.891 --> 07:06.558
What pill?
What are you talking about?

07:06.592 --> 07:08.226
You know,
birth control pills.

07:08.260 --> 07:10.161
For what?
Skin problems?

07:10.195 --> 07:12.630
You have beautiful skin.
You don't need
birth control pills.

07:12.664 --> 07:14.832
Dear God in heaven,
I'll kill him.
Kill who?

07:14.866 --> 07:17.034
You tell me.
I'm assuming Grant.
It's not his idea.

07:17.068 --> 07:19.869
I just thought this
being the anniversary
of the baby event,

07:19.904 --> 07:21.104
that I'm reminded
of how important it is

07:21.138 --> 07:23.038
to use birth control
if you're gonna have sex.

07:24.674 --> 07:27.547
Please, don't have sex.

07:27.581 --> 07:29.518
You won't like it.
It's not fun.

07:29.552 --> 07:32.054
Dad--
It's not.
Just take my word for it.

07:32.089 --> 07:36.293
All right.
Just so I'm clear,
have you had sex?

07:36.327 --> 07:37.861
No.
Oh, good.

07:37.895 --> 07:40.129
So this is still
under discussion, right?
Right.

07:40.164 --> 07:42.264
You're too young.
Just because you and Grant

07:42.299 --> 07:44.433
have all the working parts
doesn't mean the parts
should be working together.

07:44.467 --> 07:47.135
They shouldn't.
It's fine if they work alone,
but not together.

07:47.169 --> 07:50.004
I really like Grant. I do.
He's a great guy.

07:50.039 --> 07:52.006
But you don't want to have
a baby with him, do you?

07:52.041 --> 07:54.275
No. That's why I'm asking
for birth control.

07:54.309 --> 07:57.210
Yeah, but any time you have sex,
even if you're using birth
control, things can go wrong.

07:57.245 --> 07:59.480
And besides, that's what
sex is for-- making babies.

07:59.514 --> 08:01.347
Yeah, for making babies
and having fun.

08:01.381 --> 08:03.148
No, no, no. I told you,
it's not fun.

08:03.183 --> 08:05.216
Not for you.
Not for the girl.

08:05.251 --> 08:06.818
Come on, Dad.
That's not true.

08:06.852 --> 08:08.320
All right.

08:08.355 --> 08:10.389
But there are a lot of ways
to have fun without having sex.

08:10.423 --> 08:13.426
Yeah, I know. It's just,
like, Grant and I have
been making out a lot,

08:13.460 --> 08:16.030
and I'm really enjoying
making out with him,

08:16.064 --> 08:20.103
and at some point,
we might wanna do more
than that.

08:20.138 --> 08:23.277
But I just wanna make sure
I don't make any mistakes.

08:23.311 --> 08:24.679
You're not gonna make
any mistakes.

08:24.713 --> 08:26.948
Well, I'm sure everyone
who makes a mistake thinks that.

08:26.983 --> 08:29.017
All right.
Years from now,
when you're 18,

08:29.052 --> 08:30.952
then you can have sex,

08:30.986 --> 08:32.953
if it's with the right person
and for the right reason,

08:32.988 --> 08:35.490
and I'll totally sanction you
using the pill as well as

08:35.524 --> 08:37.924
any and all other forms
of birth control.

08:37.958 --> 08:41.394
But, Ashley, please,
please, please wait
until you're out of high school.

08:41.429 --> 08:44.630
I turn 18 before
I get out of high school.
Okay, so we'll compromise.

08:44.665 --> 08:47.133
It doesn't have to be after
you get out of high school,
but wait until you're 18,

08:47.167 --> 08:50.202
and then I promise
I won't fight you on this,

08:50.236 --> 08:52.337
if the aforementioned
circumstances exist
at that time.

08:52.371 --> 08:55.073
All right.
I'll agree to that.

08:55.107 --> 08:58.542
But I wanna be on the pill
anyway just in case.
No. There is no "just in case."

08:58.577 --> 09:01.177
Make sure there's no
"just in case."
Don't let things go that far.

09:01.212 --> 09:03.246
Well, I don't think I would
let things go that far.

09:03.280 --> 09:06.448
But I'm sure lots of people
don't think things will go
that far, and then they do.

09:06.483 --> 09:08.517
What people?
Oh, don't make me say it.

09:08.551 --> 09:11.252
Me and your mother?
Me and Cindy? Me and Kathleen?
Who you talking about?

09:11.287 --> 09:13.254
Kathleen?
Well, no, not Kathleen.

09:13.288 --> 09:15.389
We were actually married first.
And you should be married
first, too.

09:15.424 --> 09:17.157
But I'll go with 18.

09:17.192 --> 09:20.093
What happened, Ashley?
I mean, what prompted all this?

09:20.127 --> 09:22.328
Did you and Grant do something?
I swear I won't be upset
with you.

09:22.363 --> 09:25.664
I just want you
to tell me the truth.
I am telling you the truth.

09:25.699 --> 09:27.800
We haven't done anything,
and I don't think we will.

09:29.001 --> 09:31.736
Dad,

09:31.770 --> 09:34.238
I can see how it can happen,

09:34.273 --> 09:37.107
how even
the most experienced girl
can get pregnant.

09:37.141 --> 09:40.110
What are you talking about?
Amy wasn't the most experienced.

09:40.144 --> 09:41.944
Adrian-- She's the most
experienced, and...

09:46.215 --> 09:49.184
The first thing you should do
is tell your mother.

09:49.218 --> 09:50.852
On her wedding day?

09:50.886 --> 09:52.786
They're getting married today
at some judge's chambers.

09:52.821 --> 09:54.321
I have to go there
after school.

09:54.355 --> 09:56.489
Well, that'll be nice.
No, it's not.

09:56.524 --> 09:58.224
Not for me.
I'm not getting married.

09:58.259 --> 10:01.227
I'm just...having a baby.

10:01.262 --> 10:04.797
You think you're having a baby.
You don't know for sure
if you're having a baby.

10:04.832 --> 10:08.133
You're just late.
You can be late for
all types of reasons.

10:08.168 --> 10:09.735
Stress...

10:11.237 --> 10:12.970
Stress...

10:13.004 --> 10:14.938
Stress or...

10:14.973 --> 10:18.108
Just get an early pregnancy test
and find out, okay?

10:18.142 --> 10:21.611
I don't think you're pregnant,
but if you are pregnant,

10:21.646 --> 10:24.848
then you need to find out
as soon as possible
and let Ricky know.

10:24.882 --> 10:26.949
Ricky?
Yeah. Ricky, right?

10:28.251 --> 10:29.216
Adrian?

10:29.251 --> 10:30.784
Not Ricky.

10:30.819 --> 10:31.885
Not Ben?

10:33.153 --> 10:34.888
No. No, Adrian, not Ben.

10:34.922 --> 10:37.991
Okay. The stupid condom broke,
and I'm on a new pill, and...

10:38.026 --> 10:39.960
And there's a chance
it could still be Ricky's?

10:39.994 --> 10:41.227
No.

10:41.261 --> 10:43.629
It could still be Ricky's

10:43.664 --> 10:47.097
if you say it's Ricky's
and not Ben's.

10:47.132 --> 10:48.131
What?

10:48.166 --> 10:50.466
Who do you wanna marry,
Ricky or Ben?

10:50.500 --> 10:52.467
I don't wanna marry anyone.

10:52.502 --> 10:54.836
I'm not having a baby
if I'm having a baby.

10:54.870 --> 10:57.505
Adrian, you know how
I feel about abortion.

10:57.539 --> 10:59.673
But you're okay with lying
about who the father is?

10:59.708 --> 11:01.241
I'm just trying
to protect Ben.

11:01.276 --> 11:02.709
Oh.

11:02.744 --> 11:05.044
And if you are pregnant
with Ben's baby,

11:05.079 --> 11:07.747
then please don't tell him
this weekend.

11:07.781 --> 11:10.282
His father's getting married,
and he's so happy right now.

11:10.316 --> 11:12.683
Okay, can we just
think about me here?

11:12.718 --> 11:15.853
I'm the one who'd be
having the abortion,
not happy Ben.

11:15.887 --> 11:17.487
No, no, no, Adrian.
That's not an option.

11:17.522 --> 11:20.557
I mean, you didn't get raped
by some criminal
or your father.

11:20.591 --> 11:23.193
You had consensual sex
with a guy you like,

11:23.227 --> 11:24.661
a guy you're friends with.

11:24.695 --> 11:27.263
You have to step up
and take responsibility here.

11:27.297 --> 11:29.932
I am taking responsibility here.

11:29.966 --> 11:32.600
Look, I'm gonna have to do
what I have to do.

11:32.634 --> 11:34.969
I am not having a baby
and ruining my life

11:35.004 --> 11:36.704
like Amy did.

11:36.739 --> 11:40.173
And besides,
I can't be a mother like Amy is.

11:40.207 --> 11:42.575
There's no way I'm gonna
work at a church nursery

11:42.609 --> 11:44.610
and come home
and take care of a baby

11:44.644 --> 11:46.778
and then get up to go to
my senior year in high school.

11:46.813 --> 11:48.346
That's not gonna happen.

11:48.380 --> 11:50.180
Well, we can talk
about all that later,

11:50.215 --> 11:53.550
and we can talk about
other options like adoption.

11:53.585 --> 11:56.286
But first we need to figure out
if there's even anything
to talk about or not.

11:56.321 --> 11:59.957
If you are thinking
about terminating the pregnancy,

11:59.991 --> 12:01.525
which I'm not for--

12:01.559 --> 12:03.460
but this isn't about me,
it's about you--

12:03.495 --> 12:05.462
then you need to find out
as soon as possible.

12:05.496 --> 12:08.197
So let's go get
an early pregnancy test
and find out, okay?

12:08.232 --> 12:11.299
Well, we can do that,

12:11.333 --> 12:13.234
but I think I already know.

12:18.389 --> 12:21.190
I know the birthday party
is just for family, but...

12:27.825 --> 12:29.893
I mean, come on.
We are your family.

12:29.927 --> 12:32.029
Yeah. We've been
your family forever.

12:32.063 --> 12:33.397
Not just last year,

12:33.431 --> 12:36.133
all the years
long before Ricky.

12:36.167 --> 12:37.834
Well, I'm happy
you feel that way,

12:37.869 --> 12:40.203
because if you're my family,
then you'll support me

12:40.237 --> 12:42.339
during what promises to be
a rotten day.

12:42.373 --> 12:45.507
Well, rotten weekend,
if you plan on going
to the wedding.

12:45.541 --> 12:48.343
Or if you're not going.
Rotten either way.

12:48.377 --> 12:50.311
Support.
I need support.

12:50.345 --> 12:51.979
That is not supporting me.

12:52.013 --> 12:53.680
Well, what if we just happened
to be at the park?

12:53.714 --> 12:55.281
Then could we come?
Yeah.

12:55.315 --> 12:57.082
[sighs]

12:57.117 --> 12:58.884
Poor Amy.
Yeah.

12:58.918 --> 13:00.518
So what are you gonna wear
to the wedding?

13:00.552 --> 13:02.286
Something sexy.

13:02.320 --> 13:03.988
Me, too.

13:04.022 --> 13:06.390
So, are you and Jack
still gonna do it?

13:06.425 --> 13:08.926
Are you and Jesse?
Okay, this isn't
a sex pact.

13:08.961 --> 13:11.162
You don't need to know
if I'm gonna do it with Jesse

13:11.197 --> 13:13.265
before you decide
if you're gonna do it with Jack.

13:13.299 --> 13:15.233
I know.
But are you?

13:15.267 --> 13:18.168
Well, he wants me
to talk to my mother first.
How weird is that?

13:18.203 --> 13:20.070
Well, you're not
gonna do that, right?

13:20.104 --> 13:21.538
No. Are you?

13:21.572 --> 13:23.739
Well, I might talk
to my stepmother about it.

13:23.774 --> 13:25.374
Do you have
birth control pills?

13:25.408 --> 13:27.309
No, but I have condoms.

13:27.343 --> 13:29.144
Yeah.
I asked Jack to do that.

13:29.178 --> 13:32.346
I didn't know what to get.
I mean, do they come in sizes?

13:32.381 --> 13:34.582
Yeah, they do.
And the wrong size condom

13:34.616 --> 13:36.417
can be less effective.

13:36.451 --> 13:38.018
Hmm. That makes sense.

13:38.052 --> 13:41.387
I mean, men come
in different sizes,
don't they?

13:41.422 --> 13:44.256
I assume so.
We come in different sizes.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.325
Yeah. Well, like I said,

13:46.359 --> 13:48.460
I'm leaving it
up to Jack.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.664
You told her
to ask her mother?
Yeah.

13:50.698 --> 13:52.600
Her mother's never gonna
let you have sex with her.

13:52.634 --> 13:54.267
Yeah. I'm hoping.
What?

13:54.302 --> 13:57.270
Well, I figured
if her mom said no,
then I wouldn't have to.

13:57.304 --> 14:00.406
You don't want to?
Well, I think it's
a little too soon, isn't it?

14:00.441 --> 14:03.009
Plus it'd be her first time,
and I don't wanna be her first.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.578
That's a lot of responsibility.
You know how that goes.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.479
Been there. I know
what you're talking about.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.948
The emotional reaction
is completely unpredictable.

14:09.982 --> 14:12.717
Grace always struck me
as a little unpredictable
to begin with.

14:12.751 --> 14:14.919
How so?
All that Jesus talk.

14:14.953 --> 14:17.020
So she's a Christian.
I'm a Christian.

14:17.055 --> 14:18.422
Oh, I had no idea.

14:18.456 --> 14:20.223
Yeah. My dad's a minister
at the church.

14:20.257 --> 14:22.492
Well, if he's preaching
what you're doing,
then I'm joining.

14:22.526 --> 14:25.361
He and my mom don't
recommend sex while
you're still in high school,

14:25.395 --> 14:27.095
but they're
realistic about it.

14:27.130 --> 14:29.264
Well, half the kids
in high school don't have sex.

14:29.298 --> 14:31.699
Yeah, I know.
Well, and you should
never feel

14:31.734 --> 14:33.668
like you have to have sex,
and right now,

14:33.702 --> 14:36.003
I feel like
I have to have sex.

14:36.037 --> 14:38.238
[Grace whispering]
Psst! Jack!

14:38.273 --> 14:39.573
Psst!

14:41.309 --> 14:44.010
Excuse me. I think someone
wants to talk to me.

14:44.044 --> 14:46.112
God help you.

14:49.649 --> 14:51.483
Hey, Grace,
who are you hiding from

14:51.517 --> 14:53.318
in the hallway
where everyone can see us?

14:53.352 --> 14:55.186
Madison.
[sighs]
All right.

14:55.220 --> 14:57.321
Well, she
can find us any second,
so what do you want?

14:57.355 --> 14:59.522
And make it quick.
I don't want you
to mess up anything.

14:59.557 --> 15:01.924
Like what? Sex?
How'd you know?

15:01.959 --> 15:03.759
I'll try not to mess up
your sex life,

15:03.794 --> 15:06.394
but I'm just really upset,
and I need to talk to someone,

15:06.428 --> 15:08.496
and you're the only friend
I have besides the one
I wanna talk about.

15:08.530 --> 15:10.897
Adrian.
Shh!

15:10.932 --> 15:13.401
What did she do this time?
Who did she sleep with?
It doesn't matter.

15:13.435 --> 15:15.403
What matters is that she thinks
there might be a problem.

15:15.437 --> 15:18.205
And if there is a problem,
you and I need to get together

15:18.239 --> 15:21.641
and talk to her together
as Christians who do not
support abortion.

15:21.675 --> 15:23.676
What?
I don't know
how much time we have.

15:23.710 --> 15:26.312
And I can't do this alone.
She's not gonna listen to me.

15:26.346 --> 15:29.648
Holy shnikies.
Shh! Just be prepared.

15:29.682 --> 15:32.784
If this is just some scheme
to get me back, Grace,
it's not gonna work.

15:32.818 --> 15:35.051
I don't want you back.
I just thought that
we were friends.

15:35.086 --> 15:36.653
I'm not Adrian's friend.

15:36.687 --> 15:39.154
Ben's her friend
and your friend.
Go to Ben.

15:40.489 --> 15:42.156
No way.

15:42.190 --> 15:44.325
Jack, I swear,
if you say anything to anyone,

15:44.359 --> 15:46.160
I will make sure
you never have children.

15:46.195 --> 15:47.695
You and Tom tried that.

15:47.729 --> 15:49.631
Evidently,
I'm a man of steel.

15:49.665 --> 15:52.201
Oh, please.

15:57.273 --> 15:58.773
Hi, Madison.

15:58.807 --> 16:01.241
See you later, Jack.

16:01.275 --> 16:02.909
[sighs]

16:05.112 --> 16:07.546
That's not right.
It's John's first birthday.

16:07.580 --> 16:09.515
It's not really for him.
It's for their family,

16:09.549 --> 16:11.550
so they just
invited their families.

16:11.585 --> 16:13.151
We have a gift for him.
Yeah. So do I.

16:13.186 --> 16:15.253
We'll give the gifts to Amy,
and then she can
give them to him.

16:15.287 --> 16:17.088
No. No.
I'm not doing that.

16:17.122 --> 16:18.656
Alice.
Hank.

16:18.690 --> 16:20.758
This is what we're doing--
the three of us.

16:20.792 --> 16:23.993
We're gonna go to that birthday
party as if we never heard
it was just for the family.

16:24.028 --> 16:25.428
Alice, I can't go anyway.

16:25.462 --> 16:27.763
My dad's wedding's tomorrow.
I have a family dinner tonight.

16:27.797 --> 16:29.764
Oh, and we're not invited
to that, either?

16:29.799 --> 16:31.832
It's just me, my dad, and Betty.
It's just the three of us.

16:31.867 --> 16:33.434
And believe me,
I'm bowing out early

16:33.468 --> 16:35.635
because I'm sure
they'd rather have it
just the two of them,

16:35.670 --> 16:37.804
and they just invited me
to be polite.

16:37.838 --> 16:39.505
But both of you
are invited to the wedding.

16:39.539 --> 16:41.406
Everyone's invited
to the wedding.

16:41.441 --> 16:42.841
Even me?

16:42.875 --> 16:45.310
Because Ashley says,
no, I'm not invited,

16:45.344 --> 16:47.278
and my cousin Grant's
not invited.

16:47.313 --> 16:49.247
But, you know,
I mean, it's okay.

16:49.281 --> 16:51.749
No, that's not okay.
Listen, you're more
than welcome to come.

16:51.783 --> 16:54.217
Please come.
Bring anybody you want.
Bring your cousin.

16:54.252 --> 16:56.519
If you wanna bring a date,
you can bring a date.

16:57.488 --> 17:00.055
Bro, hey.
Love you, man.

17:00.090 --> 17:01.223
Thank you.

17:01.257 --> 17:03.058
Thank you.

17:05.193 --> 17:07.461
Who does he date?
Guess we'll find out.

17:09.997 --> 17:11.897
So, problem solved.

17:11.932 --> 17:15.000
Ben just invited me,
my date, and my cousin
to the wedding.

17:15.035 --> 17:17.368
Oh, that's great.
But who are you bringing?

17:17.403 --> 17:19.304
You're not dating anyone.

17:19.338 --> 17:22.607
Well, you really think
I'm just studying while
you're out with Grant?

17:22.641 --> 17:24.474
Well, we haven't been out.

17:24.509 --> 17:27.544
Yeah. I heard you're
thinking about staying in.

17:27.579 --> 17:29.513
What does that mean?

17:29.547 --> 17:31.914
It means it's too soon.

17:31.949 --> 17:33.816
It's really none of
your business.

17:33.851 --> 17:35.551
Oh, it is my business.
I'm your friend,

17:35.585 --> 17:37.252
so I'm making it
my business.

17:37.287 --> 17:38.754
You're 15.
It's too soon.

17:38.788 --> 17:40.722
Well, then it's too soon
for you, too.

17:40.756 --> 17:43.157
I'm supposed to be
looking out for you.

17:43.191 --> 17:45.059
I'm your Fairy Godbrother.

17:45.093 --> 17:48.094
You know, this is between
Grant and me,
not between you and me.

17:48.129 --> 17:50.229
I'm surprised he said
anything to you about it.

17:50.264 --> 17:51.797
That's not like him.

17:51.832 --> 17:54.199
And I told him I'd kill him
if he said anything.

17:54.234 --> 17:55.734
He didn't say anything.

17:55.768 --> 17:59.170
Well, then, how do you...
My dad?

17:59.204 --> 18:02.239
Don't be mad at your dad.
He's just being a dad.

18:03.475 --> 18:05.809
And I'm just being a friend.

18:07.645 --> 18:09.646
Oh, don't be like that.

18:09.680 --> 18:11.348
So you already
had a party?

18:11.382 --> 18:13.250
Not the kind of party
I wanted to have.

18:13.284 --> 18:14.685
That's not the point.
The point was,

18:14.719 --> 18:16.652
we were supposed to do this
together as John's parents.

18:16.686 --> 18:19.220
We are doing this together
as John's parents.

18:19.254 --> 18:21.956
I just did something
with him alone as John's mother.

18:21.990 --> 18:24.424
You know, I could've
just had a party alone,
too, but I didn't.

18:24.459 --> 18:26.126
I included you
and your family.

18:26.160 --> 18:28.828
But my family can't go
except for Ashley,
and that doesn't count.

18:28.863 --> 18:31.530
So you're free to do
whatever you want.

18:33.233 --> 18:34.800
Hey, what's going on?

18:34.834 --> 18:36.234
Nothing.
What do you want?

18:36.268 --> 18:39.170
I just wanna make sure you're
coming to the wedding tomorrow.

18:39.204 --> 18:42.106
Hope that you're bringing John
and anyone else you wanna bring.

18:42.140 --> 18:44.074
I'm sorry, but Amy
just makes me so crazy.

18:44.108 --> 18:46.810
Yeah, I know. She used
to make me crazy sometimes.

18:47.778 --> 18:49.846
[sighs]
I miss that sometimes.

18:49.880 --> 18:52.581
And sometimes you don't?
Sometimes I don't.

18:52.615 --> 18:54.116
What happened?

18:54.150 --> 18:55.550
It's so stupid,

18:55.585 --> 18:57.519
but Amy had a birthday party
with John all by herself,

18:57.553 --> 18:59.187
and that really
pisses me off.

18:59.221 --> 19:01.722
I mean, as much as I wish
we'd act like adults,
we don't.

19:19.661 --> 19:23.264
Yeah, we're gonna run off to Vegas
after Leo gets married to Betty tomorrow.

19:23.298 --> 19:26.467
George, are you sure
you really wanna marry Anne?

19:26.501 --> 19:28.502
You know,
you don't have to marry her

19:28.537 --> 19:30.905
just because she tricked you
into having another baby.

19:30.939 --> 19:32.840
It's our third.
She keeps tricking me,

19:32.874 --> 19:35.342
and I keep falling for it
and for her.

19:35.376 --> 19:37.043
I love her, Mims.

19:37.077 --> 19:38.977
So, Robbie fell right asleep.

19:39.012 --> 19:40.078
Oh, good.

19:40.113 --> 19:42.080
Probably tired
from riding in the car.

19:42.115 --> 19:44.449
Well, I guess I've gotta
pack my things.

19:44.484 --> 19:48.786
We'll all drive down together
to that other baby's birthday,

19:48.820 --> 19:50.888
and to your wedding.

19:50.922 --> 19:52.222
[chuckles]

19:52.257 --> 19:54.358
I can't wait.

19:56.094 --> 19:57.962
What wedding
is she talking about?

19:57.996 --> 19:59.931
We haven't decided
if we're getting married or not.

19:59.965 --> 20:01.766
Yeah, we have.
We just haven't decided when.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.667
You say next year,
I say next day. Tomorrow.

20:03.702 --> 20:06.603
George, don't you think we have
enough going on right now
without getting into all this?

20:06.638 --> 20:09.005
No. Let's get into this.
You wanna get married or not?

20:09.040 --> 20:11.007
No, not now.
Not now, tomorrow?

20:11.041 --> 20:12.041
Not tomorrow.

20:12.075 --> 20:13.808
Stop being a scaredy-cat.

20:13.843 --> 20:15.843
You know we're
gonna get married again.
Let's get married again.

20:15.878 --> 20:17.578
Stop making such
a big deal out of it.

20:17.613 --> 20:19.779
We're already a family,
and we're gonna stay a family.

20:19.814 --> 20:22.114
So let's just make it official
without making it so important.

20:22.149 --> 20:23.682
Come on.
What do you say?

20:23.716 --> 20:25.217
George, you're right.
We are a family,

20:25.251 --> 20:26.951
and we'll most likely
stay a family,

20:26.986 --> 20:28.786
but let's not make
any big deal about it.

20:28.821 --> 20:31.055
Let's just leave things
as they are.
Can't.

20:31.089 --> 20:34.058
You know, if you keep
pushing me, I'm just gonna move
in the opposite direction.

20:34.092 --> 20:37.061
It's not a good day to push me.
Then I'll push you tomorrow.
How's that?

20:38.229 --> 20:41.098
Look what I found.

20:41.132 --> 20:42.966
What-- Is that
your wedding dress?

20:43.000 --> 20:46.402
Surprised I wore white?
Your dad was, too.

20:46.437 --> 20:48.471
[laughs]
No, I'm just surprised

20:48.505 --> 20:50.440
that you have your wedding dress
hanging in your closet.

20:50.474 --> 20:54.077
Well, I recently had occasion
to wear it again.

20:54.111 --> 20:55.911
What do you mean?

20:55.946 --> 21:00.348
Mimsy, baby,
I got here as quick as I could.
Oh. Oh.

21:00.382 --> 21:03.951
The hospital said
they sent you home.
What-- What happened?

21:03.985 --> 21:06.620
Uh...
[clears throat]

21:07.956 --> 21:10.457
Meet Mr. and Mrs. Levy.

21:11.693 --> 21:13.960
Oh, God. Now I think
I'm having a stroke.

21:16.664 --> 21:18.964
Is he really asleep,
orre you just
holding him captive?

21:18.999 --> 21:21.066
You don't technically get him
until it's bedtime.

21:21.100 --> 21:22.734
It's not bedtime.
It's nap time.

21:22.768 --> 21:25.336
Amy, you agreed
to have the party
this afternoon at the park.

21:25.370 --> 21:27.337
Can we just go and get
this over with, please?

21:27.371 --> 21:29.339
"Get this over with"?
It's John's first birthday.

21:29.373 --> 21:32.975
It's supposed to be fun,
not like his first party.
What first party?

21:33.009 --> 21:36.011
Amy and John had a party
all by themselves last night.

21:36.045 --> 21:37.045
Oh, great.

21:37.079 --> 21:38.313
I'm glad that we did.

21:38.347 --> 21:40.281
It's raining, so there's
no party at the park.

21:40.316 --> 21:41.849
Then we'd move it
to my apartment.

21:41.884 --> 21:43.984
Why are you being so crazy?
You're making me crazy.

21:44.019 --> 21:46.153
This is what I was trying
to avoid-- all the drama

21:46.187 --> 21:49.055
that goes on in this house
every time I come over
to see John.

21:49.089 --> 21:50.656
<i>[John crying]</i>

21:50.689 --> 21:52.623
I'll get him.

21:53.925 --> 21:56.292
What is wrong with her?
I don't know.

21:56.327 --> 21:58.027
Well, she is
a 16-year-old mother

21:58.062 --> 22:00.661
who had to agree to give up
her son weekends to his dad.

22:00.696 --> 22:02.930
I know, Ashley.
I know it's not easy on her.

22:02.964 --> 22:04.998
I'm trying to make it
as easy as possible, though.

22:05.032 --> 22:06.932
Then she went and had
a party all by herself.

22:06.967 --> 22:09.266
What are you, a girl now?

22:09.301 --> 22:11.634
Yeah, I guess I am.

22:11.668 --> 22:13.902
I don't know why
that bothers me so much.

22:13.936 --> 22:15.937
He doesn't know they had
a party without me,

22:15.972 --> 22:18.939
but that is technically
his first birthday party.

22:18.973 --> 22:20.607
And there I go again.
Jeez.

22:22.209 --> 22:23.809
Hey, John.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.711
Say hi to Daddy.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.781
Come on, Amy.
Come to the party.

22:29.815 --> 22:31.182
I want you at the party.

22:31.216 --> 22:33.717
You have to be at the party.
You're the mom.

22:33.752 --> 22:35.853
He loves you.

22:35.887 --> 22:38.624
I'm sorry.

22:38.658 --> 22:41.025
I'm sorry that I had a party
without you.

22:41.060 --> 22:43.560
I cannot control myself.

22:43.595 --> 22:46.729
I just wanna, like,
stomp my feet and scream.

22:46.763 --> 22:49.531
I know what we worked out
was fair,

22:49.565 --> 22:51.800
but it seems so unfair still.

22:51.834 --> 22:53.401
And now my parents
aren't going to be there,

22:53.435 --> 22:55.537
and your parents are,

22:55.571 --> 22:58.106
and it's just not
how I pictured John's
first birthday.

22:58.140 --> 23:00.573
All right.
Well, let's think about this.

23:00.608 --> 23:02.641
Your parents can't come,
so I'll ask my parents

23:02.675 --> 23:04.609
if they mind backing out
and seeing him tomorrow.

23:04.643 --> 23:07.312
And it'll just be you and me.

23:07.346 --> 23:09.347
Pack your bag,
come over and spend the night.

23:09.381 --> 23:12.082
I'll sleep on the couch.
It's just you, me, and John

23:12.116 --> 23:15.018
at his first birthday party.
[babbles]

23:15.052 --> 23:16.986
John will have
his mommy and daddy.

23:17.021 --> 23:18.988
Both of us. Okay?

23:19.023 --> 23:21.223
What about that?

23:21.258 --> 23:23.090
What do you say?

23:23.125 --> 23:24.925
Okay.

23:31.029 --> 23:32.563
So I'm not going?

23:32.598 --> 23:35.433
Do you wanna go?
Well, of course I wanna go.

23:35.467 --> 23:37.435
You know, I think this is
really a good idea

23:37.469 --> 23:39.403
for just you and Ricky
to be at the party.

23:39.438 --> 23:42.772
Just you, Ricky, and John.
It's perfect.

23:42.806 --> 23:45.775
So do it, Amy. Go.
Go and have a good time.

23:45.809 --> 23:47.909
You sure, Ashley?
Mom and Dad aren't here,

23:47.943 --> 23:50.044
so they probably won't
make it home tonight,

23:50.078 --> 23:51.712
and you'll be alone
in the house.

23:51.746 --> 23:53.480
You going to be okay
here by yourself?

23:53.514 --> 23:56.015
Could Griffin come over
and stay or something?

23:56.049 --> 23:58.283
Yeah, or something.
You go.

24:01.186 --> 24:03.020
[dialing phone number]

24:05.023 --> 24:06.623
Hi, Grant.

24:10.527 --> 24:13.129
What's taking so long?
Your mother's wedding dress.

24:13.164 --> 24:15.664
Oh. Then she should take
as long as she likes,

24:15.699 --> 24:17.666
because when my mother
sees a picture of my bride

24:17.700 --> 24:20.201
in that dress,
she's gonna be thrilled.

24:20.235 --> 24:23.270
Have you seen the dress?
Well, I didn't wanna see it
before the wedding.

24:23.305 --> 24:25.005
That's bad luck.
Yeah.

24:25.039 --> 24:28.540
Well, all I can say
is my mother really,
really loves you.

24:29.974 --> 24:31.975
Oh. Cindy.

24:32.010 --> 24:33.710
Nice to meet you.

24:33.744 --> 24:35.578
Uh, this isn't Cindy.

24:35.612 --> 24:38.247
This is Adrian
my daughter.

24:38.282 --> 24:40.715
Adrian, this is Fast Eddie.

24:42.284 --> 24:45.919
I'm sorry.
I meant, this is Judge Cooper.

24:45.954 --> 24:47.320
I'm a little nervous.

24:47.355 --> 24:50.389
They call me "Fast Eddie"
because I don't waste
any time in court.

24:50.424 --> 24:52.057
Oh, well, nice to meet you.

24:52.092 --> 24:53.559
It's nice to meet you,
too, Adrian.

24:53.593 --> 24:55.293
This is a special day
for your parents

24:55.328 --> 24:57.962
and, I understand,
a dream come true for you.

24:57.996 --> 24:59.597
Yeah.

24:59.631 --> 25:01.999
Something wrong, Adrian?
You feeling all right?

25:02.033 --> 25:03.967
You look a little pale.

25:04.001 --> 25:07.303
Okay, one, my fault
for not opening
the package sooner,

25:07.338 --> 25:09.005
and wearing
my sweats down here,

25:09.040 --> 25:11.408
thinking I was gonna
be putting on
this beautiful wedding dress.

25:11.442 --> 25:14.944
And two, certainly your mother
did not get married
in this dress.

25:14.978 --> 25:17.612
And three, she hates me,
because I was sitting
right next to you

25:17.646 --> 25:20.447
when you told her
I was a size two,
not a 32.

25:20.481 --> 25:23.649
I, uh,
don't know what to say.

25:23.684 --> 25:25.284
You look...

25:26.954 --> 25:28.221
funny.

25:28.255 --> 25:29.822
[laughing]

25:31.991 --> 25:34.359
I promise to never let this

25:34.394 --> 25:37.162
or anything else my mother does
come between the two of us.

25:37.196 --> 25:39.863
And I love you
for wearing that.

25:39.898 --> 25:41.932
I love you, Cindy.

25:43.100 --> 25:45.001
And I love you, too, Adrian.

25:45.036 --> 25:49.272
I only wish that I
had married your mother
when I should have.

25:50.374 --> 25:53.209
And I'm so glad
she had you.

25:53.243 --> 25:54.743
I am, too.

25:54.778 --> 25:56.979
I am, too.

25:57.013 --> 25:59.449
Okay, just do it.

25:59.483 --> 26:01.518
We'll need
a witness here.

26:06.893 --> 26:10.896
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today

26:10.931 --> 26:13.865
to join these two people
in holy matrimony.

26:18.654 --> 26:20.556
Oh, my God,
we're soaked.

26:25.490 --> 26:27.058
Here's the key.

26:27.092 --> 26:30.060
Let yourself in.
I'll go get the suitcase.

26:30.095 --> 26:31.795
Hi.

26:31.830 --> 26:34.064
- Hi, Ben.
- Hi.

26:34.098 --> 26:37.233
I guess the birthday party
got rained out. Hi, John.

26:37.267 --> 26:39.302
Say hi to Ben.

26:39.336 --> 26:42.037
Why don't I take him up
and get him changed?
No, I can do it.

26:42.072 --> 26:44.906
Or, yeah, I can go get
your suitcase or...

26:44.941 --> 26:47.542
You spending the night?
Hey, look who's here.

26:47.576 --> 26:49.644
The birthday boy.
Hi, Amy.

26:49.678 --> 26:51.445
You know Bunny?
This is our boss.

26:51.479 --> 26:54.414
We've never been introduced,
but I've heard a lot
of nice things about you.

26:54.448 --> 26:55.815
Same here.

26:58.618 --> 27:01.453
I took all
the party things upstairs,

27:01.487 --> 27:05.288
and Ben gave me some presents
from some of your friends
for the little guy.

27:05.322 --> 27:08.957
Yeah, I did. Of course,
I won't be coming to the party.

27:08.991 --> 27:11.392
No, 'cause you got
a big wedding
to go to tomorrow,

27:11.426 --> 27:13.760
and your dad needs you,
so why don't you take off?

27:13.795 --> 27:15.428
I can close up here.

27:15.463 --> 27:18.163
I didn't know
it was gonna be a sleepover
kind of birthday party.

27:18.197 --> 27:20.899
No wonder no one else
was invited.

27:26.371 --> 27:27.938
I don't believe that.

27:27.973 --> 27:30.207
Hey, hey.
You don't believe what?

27:30.241 --> 27:32.175
He was just complaining
this morning
that she makes him crazy.

27:32.209 --> 27:34.476
Now he's sleeping with her.
She's sleeping with him.

27:34.511 --> 27:37.045
You don't know that anyone's
sleeping with anyone.

27:37.079 --> 27:38.379
He just said,
"I'll go get your suitcase."

27:38.413 --> 27:40.781
None of your business, Ben.
Let it go.

27:40.816 --> 27:43.451
It is my business.
This is the family apartment.

27:43.485 --> 27:46.987
And it's--
it's completely wrong.

27:47.021 --> 27:49.889
It's okay, Ben.
It's gonna be fine.

27:49.923 --> 27:52.391
Go home,
take care of your dad,

27:52.426 --> 27:56.663
and do not,
under any circumstances,
ruin his wedding day.

27:56.698 --> 27:58.899
You hear me?
That should've been my baby.

27:58.933 --> 28:02.402
I would've been a good father.
I would've been a good husband
and a good father.

28:02.436 --> 28:04.870
Yes, you would, Ben,
but it's not your time.

28:04.904 --> 28:06.572
It's not your time.

28:06.606 --> 28:09.074
I'll see you tomorrow.

28:10.376 --> 28:12.043
[sighs]

28:15.114 --> 28:17.581
I'm sorry, Bunny.
I'm not angry at you.

28:17.615 --> 28:19.715
I'm angry with myself.

28:19.750 --> 28:22.852
I've completely ruined
my life.

28:24.455 --> 28:26.956
I hope not.

28:28.125 --> 28:29.458
[bell jingling]

28:30.660 --> 28:32.494
I'm not gonna do it tonight.

28:32.528 --> 28:34.195
We can't do it tonight.

28:34.229 --> 28:36.530
I'm not
emotionally prepared.

28:36.565 --> 28:38.131
And I wanna be wearing
my new dress,

28:38.166 --> 28:39.932
and I wanna have
my makeup done.

28:39.967 --> 28:41.901
I don't know.
Just, I don't
wanna do it tonight.

28:41.935 --> 28:43.635
All right.
I can wait one more night.

28:43.670 --> 28:45.437
Right.

28:45.471 --> 28:46.971
Are you nervous?

28:47.006 --> 28:48.706
No. I'm not nervous.
I'm ready.

28:48.741 --> 28:50.441
You're sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.

28:50.475 --> 28:52.342
Did you get the condoms?

28:52.376 --> 28:53.643
Yes.

28:53.677 --> 28:55.044
Can I see them?

28:55.078 --> 28:56.011
Uh, yeah.

29:03.319 --> 29:04.819
I've never seen one before.

29:04.853 --> 29:07.187
Well, we can look at one
together if you want,

29:07.222 --> 29:09.155
or I can just take care
of that myself tomorrow night,

29:09.189 --> 29:10.890
and you really don't
need to see it.

29:10.924 --> 29:13.326
Yeah, that'd be good.
I don't really wanna see it.

29:13.361 --> 29:14.795
All right.

29:14.829 --> 29:16.129
So what if it breaks?

29:16.164 --> 29:18.665
That would be bad.
You're not on the pill, are you?

29:18.699 --> 29:22.134
No. But as long
as it doesn't break,
we're okay, right?

29:22.168 --> 29:24.202
Right, but these things
can break.

29:24.236 --> 29:26.740
They usually don't.
It's never happened
to me before,

29:26.774 --> 29:30.376
but they can,
like with Adrian and Ben.

29:32.479 --> 29:33.946
What?
What?

29:33.980 --> 29:35.381
"With Adrian and Ben"?

29:35.415 --> 29:37.449
What are you talking about?
You said, "Adrian and Ben."

29:37.484 --> 29:39.451
Huh?
Yeah.

29:39.485 --> 29:41.119
Why would you say that?

29:41.153 --> 29:43.254
Why would you know that?
I mean, how would you know that?

29:43.289 --> 29:45.790
This isn't that "who, what,
when, where, and why"

29:45.824 --> 29:47.757
that they talk about
in journalism, is it?

29:47.792 --> 29:51.160
Hey, this isn't an interview.
No, it's off the record.
Now answer the question.

29:51.194 --> 29:53.962
All right, Madison.
This is what I was talking
to Grace about today--

29:53.996 --> 29:55.864
about Adrian and Ben.

29:55.898 --> 29:58.566
Oh, my God.
You cannot say a word--

29:58.601 --> 30:00.635
not a word-- to anyone.

30:00.669 --> 30:02.503
I'm serious.
She's pregnant.

30:02.537 --> 30:04.838
She doesn't know.
It's just that

30:04.872 --> 30:08.140
when something
like that happens,
it's pretty scary.

30:08.175 --> 30:11.377
But she told Grace because
she thinks she's pregnant,
and she wants an abortion.

30:11.411 --> 30:13.412
That's why Grace
told you.
Damn, you're good.

30:13.446 --> 30:16.314
Well, I'm not gonna
tell anybody. I promise.

30:16.349 --> 30:19.350
Please don't.
I'm sure the word
will get out soon enough.

30:19.384 --> 30:21.018
But Ben doesn't know.

30:21.052 --> 30:24.488
No one knows other than Grace
and you and me.

30:24.522 --> 30:27.424
That's it.
[sighs]

30:29.493 --> 30:31.127
Oh, God.

30:34.665 --> 30:35.631
[crying]

30:35.666 --> 30:37.466
[ringing]

30:37.500 --> 30:38.734
Hi, Grace.

30:38.768 --> 30:41.503
Hi, Adrian.
How are you?
How was the wedding?

30:41.538 --> 30:43.839
<i>Beautiful.
Really?</i>

30:43.873 --> 30:45.874
<i>That's nice.
Yeah.</i>

30:45.908 --> 30:48.643
Nice. They went away
for the weekend.

30:48.677 --> 30:51.778
Ruben surprised her
and got the bridal suite
at some Beverly Hills hotel.

30:51.812 --> 30:54.079
<i>Wow.
Yep. Wow.</i>

30:54.114 --> 30:56.481
<i>I have to go.
Wait.</i>

30:57.583 --> 30:58.950
Are you there by yourself?

30:58.984 --> 31:00.351
Yeah, I'm here by myself.

31:00.386 --> 31:02.019
Did you get
the early pregnancy test?

31:02.054 --> 31:04.488
Yeah. I bought one
on the way home.

31:04.522 --> 31:05.888
Do you want me to come over?

31:05.923 --> 31:08.390
No, Grace, I don't want you
to come over here.

31:08.424 --> 31:11.158
Adrian, I don't want you
to be alone
when you take the test.

31:11.192 --> 31:12.625
I'll come over.
I'm your friend.

31:12.660 --> 31:14.026
You know what, Grace?

31:14.060 --> 31:15.794
I don't know
if I want you to know.

31:15.829 --> 31:17.862
<i>Maybe you shouldn't know.
Why is that?</i>

31:17.896 --> 31:21.497
You know why, Grace.
And I saw you talking to Jack.

31:21.531 --> 31:24.899
If I find out I'm pregnant,
then it's my choice
as to what I do.

31:24.934 --> 31:27.401
It's not your choice,
and it's not Jack's choice.

31:27.436 --> 31:29.470
If you two ever get pregnant,
then it'll be your choice.

31:29.504 --> 31:32.372
Adrian, I just want you
to do the right thing.

31:32.407 --> 31:33.940
I will, Grace.

31:33.974 --> 31:36.776
I will do the right thing...
for me.

31:36.810 --> 31:38.544
<i>And the thing is, Grace,</i>

31:38.578 --> 31:40.945
I didn't get into this
all by myself,

31:40.980 --> 31:43.715
so I think the person
that I should have with me

31:43.749 --> 31:45.249
when I take this test
is Ben.

31:45.283 --> 31:47.317
<i>But don't say anything
to him.</i>

31:47.352 --> 31:49.886
<i>Let me be
the one to tell him.
I understand.</i>

31:49.921 --> 31:52.455
If you change your mind,
if you want me there,

31:52.490 --> 31:53.890
<i>just call me.
All right.</i>

31:53.924 --> 31:57.026
I will,
if I change my mind.

31:57.060 --> 31:59.494
I'm really sorry you're going
through all this, Adrian.

31:59.529 --> 32:02.163
Thanks, Grace.

32:02.197 --> 32:03.130
[beeps]

32:04.199 --> 32:05.366
[beeps]

32:06.668 --> 32:08.134
[sighs]

32:08.169 --> 32:10.236
<i>[recorded message]
It's me. It's Amy.</i>

32:10.270 --> 32:12.938
<i>Leave a message
for me and John.
[John laughing]</i>

32:12.973 --> 32:15.641
<i>[beeps]
Hi, Amy.</i>

32:15.675 --> 32:17.976
I'm really happy
I got your voice mail.

32:18.010 --> 32:20.011
I don't wanna bother you.

32:20.045 --> 32:23.681
I know that you and Ricky
are together tonight with John.

32:23.715 --> 32:27.017
But I just wanted to say

32:27.051 --> 32:30.853
that no matter what happens
between us in life, Amy,

32:30.887 --> 32:32.988
I'll always love you.

32:34.090 --> 32:37.058
And I just wanted you
to know that.

32:37.993 --> 32:40.695
And if you ever need me,

32:40.729 --> 32:43.163
you can call me,
and I'll be there.

32:44.632 --> 32:49.402
Good night, Amy.
And happy birthday, John.

32:56.882 --> 33:00.251
That was
a beautiful wedding.
Wasn't it?

33:05.285 --> 33:08.754
Ben, your dad and Betty--
they looked so happy
and so in love.

33:08.788 --> 33:11.256
Here's to love and happiness.

33:17.095 --> 33:19.896
Thank you
for last night.

33:19.931 --> 33:21.831
Thank you
for last year.

33:21.866 --> 33:23.933
You should really
thank your mother
for babysitting today,

33:23.967 --> 33:25.267
Robbie and John.

33:25.302 --> 33:27.903
She's used to
a lot of kids.

33:29.439 --> 33:32.608
- I love you, Hank.
- I love you, Alice.

33:32.642 --> 33:35.143
I wanna have
a wedding like this.

33:35.177 --> 33:39.046
- Anytime soon?
- Tenth grade's a little early.

33:39.080 --> 33:41.448
A little. Yeah.

33:51.358 --> 33:54.627
I just seems
more romantic to wait.

33:54.662 --> 33:57.130
You don't think Leo
and Betty waited, do you?

33:57.164 --> 33:58.965
I don't know.

33:58.999 --> 34:01.700
I doubt it.
But I get your point.

34:01.735 --> 34:03.802
I guess your mother
hates me now.

34:03.836 --> 34:05.837
Not just my mother,

34:05.871 --> 34:08.839
my father, my stepfather,
and my grandmother.

34:08.873 --> 34:11.040
Well, it's better
than doing it too soon.

34:11.074 --> 34:13.041
I'll win them over.
You'll see.

34:13.074 --> 34:15.975
I'm sure you will.
Yeah.

34:16.010 --> 34:17.744
So, is Kathleen
coming, George?

34:17.779 --> 34:20.947
I've always
wanted to meet her.
She was inside.

34:20.982 --> 34:22.349
I'll introduce you.

34:22.382 --> 34:24.050
You two have a lot
in common,

34:24.085 --> 34:26.252
what with being
newlyweds and all.

34:26.286 --> 34:27.719
Here you go, sweetheart.

34:27.754 --> 34:29.388
Oh, thank you,

34:29.422 --> 34:31.723
lover.
[chuckles]

34:31.757 --> 34:33.391
Oh, jeez.

34:33.425 --> 34:35.826
Hey, maybe you two would like
to be witnesseat our wedding.

34:35.860 --> 34:37.962
What wedding?

34:37.996 --> 34:39.630
Oh, there's Kathleen.

34:39.664 --> 34:41.364
Hi.
Where's your husband?

34:41.399 --> 34:42.998
He's delivering a baby.
Emergency.

34:43.033 --> 34:45.333
I did that one-handed.

34:45.367 --> 34:47.134
Hi, I'm Anne's mother.

34:47.168 --> 34:48.668
Sit down.

34:48.703 --> 34:51.204
I have so many
questions to ask.

34:51.237 --> 34:53.906
Yeah, join us.
This should be fun.

34:57.776 --> 34:58.843
Hi, Jack.

34:58.877 --> 35:01.145
Hey, Adrian.
How you doing?

35:03.181 --> 35:05.081
She told you,
didn't she?

35:05.116 --> 35:07.950
To be honest with you, yes.

35:07.985 --> 35:10.320
And you ld Madison?
No.

35:10.354 --> 35:12.322
All right.
Well, where is Madison?

35:55.925 --> 35:57.493
Ladies and gentlemen,

35:57.527 --> 36:00.795
I am proud to present
Mr. and Mrs. Leo Boykewich.

36:00.829 --> 36:01.929
[applause]

36:01.963 --> 36:03.964
The Sausage King
and his queen.

36:03.998 --> 36:05.832
[applauscontinues]

36:22.213 --> 36:25.381
Thank you for joining
Betty and Ben and me today

36:25.415 --> 36:27.382
to celebrate
our new lives together.

36:28.851 --> 36:32.887
I am truly a blessed man
to have Betty as my wife

36:32.921 --> 36:34.488
Ben as my son,

36:34.522 --> 36:38.057
and all of you
as our friends.
All of you.

36:38.091 --> 36:39.625
[crowd]
And to you.

36:39.659 --> 36:40.826
<i>Salud.</i>

36:40.860 --> 36:42.360
[Man] Cheers!
[Man #2]
You look beautiful, Betty.

36:45.330 --> 36:51.034
<i>Bunny.
<i>Oh, see?</i></i>

36:51.068 --> 36:53.603
My favorite song--
"Last Chance for Love."

36:53.637 --> 36:57.105
Do you get it?
I get it, honey.
I totally get it.

37:15.688 --> 37:19.090
<i>So, he's a gynecologist.</i>

37:19.124 --> 37:20.224
He is.

37:20.259 --> 37:21.892
So how long after a stroke

37:21.927 --> 37:25.329
is it safe to have sex?
Well, I'm not a doctor.

37:25.363 --> 37:27.130
But you've been married
to two of them.

37:27.164 --> 37:29.498
Yeah, well, you know,
I don't know about the sex,

37:29.533 --> 37:32.267
but alcohol is definitely
a no-no.

37:38.140 --> 37:40.508
<i>Who's that with Mimsy?</i>

37:40.542 --> 37:42.476
Well, if you'd been home
last night, you'd know.

37:42.510 --> 37:44.444
That's your new gramps.
Dad?

37:44.478 --> 37:46.145
That's right.
And if you were home last night,

37:46.179 --> 37:48.313
she wouldn't
have been home last night
alone with her boyfriend.

37:48.348 --> 37:50.281
I swear we weren't alone.
Griffin was there, too.

37:50.316 --> 37:53.417
We'll never know if that's true
or not, because you've
been known to lie.

37:53.452 --> 37:55.752
Ask Griffin.
Where is Griffin?

37:57.088 --> 37:58.555
Hey, Michael,
you're showing off.

37:58.589 --> 38:00.923
Hey, just because I dance
better than you do

38:00.958 --> 38:04.159
doesn't mean
I'm showing off.

38:04.193 --> 38:05.760
You're showing off.

38:05.795 --> 38:08.763
Oh, now look who's gone
and got all self-conscious.

38:08.797 --> 38:11.165
Oh, oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah?

38:15.870 --> 38:17.871
Come on. Let's dance.

38:17.905 --> 38:19.338
Oh, I can't.
I don't do disco.

38:19.373 --> 38:20.873
I still wanna talk to you

38:20.908 --> 38:23.075
right after I talk to him.

38:28.814 --> 38:31.616
You two better not have
done anything.

38:31.650 --> 38:33.818
I could say
the same to you, sister.

38:33.852 --> 38:36.653
<i>âª Come on, baby,
dance that dance âª
How'd it go?</i>

38:36.688 --> 38:40.323
That's for me to know
and you to find out,
for once.

38:40.357 --> 38:42.891
<i>All right.
âª Come on, baby âª</i>

38:42.926 --> 38:46.528
<i>âª Let's dance tonight âª</i>

38:46.563 --> 38:48.730
What'd you find out?
Not much.

38:48.765 --> 38:50.598
Ashley asked me about
birth control pills yesterday?

38:50.633 --> 38:52.867
What?
Yeah. I'll talk to her,
you talk to Amy.

38:52.901 --> 38:55.903
I talked to Amy.
We don't have to worry
about Amy and Ricky.

38:55.937 --> 38:58.238
We have to worry
about Amy and Ben.

38:58.272 --> 39:00.239
I thought--
Yeah, I did, too.

39:00.273 --> 39:02.775
What about Jimmy?
They're friends.

39:02.809 --> 39:04.843
Friends, just like us.
âª [big band, slow tempo]

39:04.877 --> 39:06.678
George, we are friends,

39:06.712 --> 39:10.247
and that's a good place to be
after all we've been through.

39:10.282 --> 39:11.849
I'm happy that we're friends.

39:11.883 --> 39:14.451
But I don't wanna get married
just because we had a baby.

39:14.485 --> 39:16.619
Three babies.
And two of them
are almost grown.

39:16.654 --> 39:19.021
One of them has
a baby of their own.

39:19.055 --> 39:21.656
We wouldn't tell Amy
to marry Ricky just because
they had a baby.

39:21.691 --> 39:25.693
I'm Ricky?
George, we've changed a lot
over the years,

39:25.727 --> 39:28.462
but I'm not sure that,
other than the children,
we have that much in common.

39:28.496 --> 39:31.597
I mean, I love
a lot of things about you.

39:31.632 --> 39:34.199
I respect you.
I think you're funny.

39:34.234 --> 39:35.901
Thank you, finally.

39:35.935 --> 39:37.936
Let's just
take our time, okay?

39:37.970 --> 39:39.771
There's no hurry.

39:39.805 --> 39:41.806
I want us to get
to know each other again.

39:55.852 --> 39:58.120
Hi, Ben.

40:02.691 --> 40:05.226
Oh. Hey, Adrian.

40:06.895 --> 40:09.963
It's a beautiful wedding.

40:09.997 --> 40:13.833
Yeah, it is. I'm really happy
you could make it.
Me, too.

40:13.867 --> 40:16.502
Oh, how was
the wedding yesterday--
your mom and dad's?

40:16.536 --> 40:17.836
Oh, great.

40:19.105 --> 40:20.972
All right.
Enough small talk.

40:21.006 --> 40:23.274
Look, no time
is a good time for this,

40:23.308 --> 40:25.910
and, well, I don't think
I can wait any longer.

40:27.512 --> 40:29.246
I wonder what's
going on with them.

40:29.280 --> 40:31.581
[no audible dialogue]

40:31.615 --> 40:34.450
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

40:34.484 --> 40:36.952
You could be right
about that,

40:36.986 --> 40:39.020
because Ben
called me last night.

40:39.054 --> 40:41.122
He left a message
for me.

40:41.156 --> 40:43.657
He told me
that he loves me.

40:43.692 --> 40:44.892
Really?
Really?

40:46.127 --> 40:49.095
And do you
love him?

40:49.129 --> 40:51.163
I don't know.

40:51.197 --> 40:53.698
I guess
time will tell.

40:57.669 --> 40:59.236
Where's your boyfriend?

40:59.271 --> 41:01.805
He's over there,
staring at us.

41:03.240 --> 41:05.208
I told him I just wanted
to say hello to you.

41:05.242 --> 41:07.043
What's up with you two?

41:07.077 --> 41:10.011
Not much.
Keep it that way.

41:10.046 --> 41:12.447
- Because?
- Because.

41:12.481 --> 41:14.782
That's not
a good enough reason.

41:14.817 --> 41:16.483
That's all I've got
right now.

41:25.058 --> 41:28.326
No. No, no, no.

41:30.829 --> 41:32.630
[sighs]

41:40.603 --> 41:44.240
You had a few?
It's just one.

41:46.910 --> 41:48.610
Me, too.

41:48.644 --> 41:50.311
I'm sorry.
You broke up with Tammy?

41:50.346 --> 41:52.813
I didn't break up
with Tammy.

41:52.848 --> 41:54.782
She's just late.
There she is.

41:56.651 --> 41:58.785
I've missed you, Tom!

42:00.854 --> 42:02.655
But not her!

42:05.792 --> 42:07.392
[laughs]

42:07.426 --> 42:10.829
âª [ends]
[no audible dialogue]

42:10.863 --> 42:12.797
[applause]

42:17.937 --> 42:20.037
âª [piano]
Did Adrian tell Ben yet?

42:20.072 --> 42:22.205
I think she's
telling him right now.

42:22.240 --> 42:24.606
I'm sorry
I even told you.

42:24.641 --> 42:26.975
I think this time
we should just stay out of it.

42:27.009 --> 42:28.776
All right.
