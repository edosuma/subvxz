Subrip by DanDee

00:42.174 --> 00:45.677
<i>¶ Life is a rolling ocean ¶</i>

00:45.744 --> 00:49.180
<i>¶ If you want to stay
in motion ¶</i>

00:49.247 --> 00:51.050
<i>¶ You gotta get,
you gotta get ¶</i>

00:51.116 --> 00:54.219
<i>¶ You gotta get
ahead of the wave ¶</i>

00:56.322 --> 00:59.492
<i>¶ Young love's never humble ¶</i>

00:59.558 --> 01:03.061
<i>¶ Everybody takes a tumble ¶</i>

01:03.128 --> 01:04.763
<i>¶ Better get, you better get ¶</i>

01:04.828 --> 01:08.134
<i>¶ You better get
your head on straight ¶</i>

01:10.036 --> 01:12.004
<i>¶ Hear that rolling ocean ¶</i>

01:12.070 --> 01:14.239
<i>¶ Better get ahead ¶</i>

01:16.575 --> 01:19.043
<i>¶ You know
that wave is comin' ¶</i>

01:19.111 --> 01:21.614
<i>¶ Better get ahead ¶</i>

01:25.284 --> 01:28.921
<i>¶ If you want to catch
the big fish ¶</i>

01:28.987 --> 01:32.191
<i>¶ And take him to cherish ¶</i>

01:32.257 --> 01:33.725
<i>¶ You gotta get,
you gotta get ¶</i>

01:33.793 --> 01:37.564
<i>¶ You got to get
ahead of the wave ¶</i>

01:38.930 --> 01:41.299
<i>¶ Hear that rolling ocean ¶</i>

01:41.367 --> 01:43.837
<i>¶ You better get ahead ¶</i>

01:45.605 --> 01:47.972
<i>¶ You know that wave
is coming ¶</i>

01:48.040 --> 01:49.708
<i>¶ Better get ahead ¶</i>

01:49.775 --> 01:51.243
<i>324!</i>

01:51.311 --> 01:54.714
325, 326, 327...

01:54.781 --> 01:56.015
328...

01:56.081 --> 01:57.983
32... 32... 329.
Yeah.

01:58.049 --> 01:59.951
Watching you guys
play badminton

02:00.019 --> 02:01.553
makes me profoundly sad.

02:01.620 --> 02:04.056
We weren't
playing badminton, Glenn.

02:04.123 --> 02:05.557
We were playing goodminton.

02:05.623 --> 02:07.292
The point is to hit it
as soft as possible

02:07.359 --> 02:09.294
to get as many in a row
as we can.

02:09.360 --> 02:11.429
It's a game of
gentlemanly cooperation.

02:11.497 --> 02:12.798
I'll bet you two learned
a lot

02:12.865 --> 02:15.201
about gentlemanly cooperation
in your bed,

02:15.266 --> 02:16.603
where you have sex.

02:16.669 --> 02:18.471
No one likes
a homophobe, Glenn.

02:18.538 --> 02:20.673
And no one likes
you two assholes.

02:20.740 --> 02:22.707
You kiss your mother
with that filthy mouth?

02:22.775 --> 02:24.576
You kiss your boyfriend
with those ugly lips?

02:24.644 --> 02:27.413
As a matter of fact...
In your fricking face.

02:27.479 --> 02:29.248
Whoa, you can't talk
to the kid like that.

02:29.314 --> 02:30.682
That's not a kid.
That's Glenn.

02:30.750 --> 02:31.984
He's a dick.

02:32.050 --> 02:33.652
-Screw you.
-Okay!

02:33.718 --> 02:34.953
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

02:35.020 --> 02:36.355
Come on.

02:36.421 --> 02:38.157
-Screw you, fighter baby.
-Glenn, go... go home.

02:38.223 --> 02:39.558
You're lucky.
You're lucky.

02:39.625 --> 02:40.793
Hey, come on.

02:40.860 --> 02:42.161
We're gonna be late
for our double date.

02:42.228 --> 02:43.796
Suckers.

02:46.899 --> 02:48.467
<i>To be clear, no,</i>

02:48.533 --> 02:50.335
<i>he doesn't really kiss me
with those ugly lips,</i>

02:50.401 --> 02:52.204
<i>because we're into girls...</i>

02:52.270 --> 02:55.039
<i>specifically these two
extremely attractive girls</i>

02:55.106 --> 02:56.842
<i>that are meeting us right now.</i>

02:56.908 --> 02:59.745
<i>This seaside pub
is rustic yet hip,</i>

02:59.812 --> 03:01.080
<i>this is my favorite shirt,</i>

03:01.146 --> 03:02.748
<i>and I'm having
a pretty decent hair day.</i>

03:02.814 --> 03:04.750
<i>Yup, it's a good day
for capital-L love.</i>

03:04.817 --> 03:06.618
<i>Ford over here
is more interested in, well,</i>

03:06.686 --> 03:08.921
<i>the kind of love
you don't have to call again.</i>

03:08.987 --> 03:13.658
<i>Now, despite all odds, we are
crushing this first date.</i>

03:13.725 --> 03:16.429
I could imagine just
staying in on a Saturday night

03:16.495 --> 03:18.497
and watching
dry British comedies

03:18.563 --> 03:20.231
and, you know, streaming,

03:20.299 --> 03:22.468
and it's like I kind of
fantasize about, like,

03:22.534 --> 03:24.235
cuddling you, you know?

03:24.302 --> 03:27.240
<i>Ooh, that sounded way better
in my head.</i>

03:27.306 --> 03:29.275
<i>Maybe they didn't hear me.</i>

03:31.109 --> 03:32.578
<i>Ah, I just blew it for us.</i>

03:32.645 --> 03:34.780
Oh, my gosh.
I should go.

03:34.847 --> 03:36.481
This is gonna be too awkward
for me to handle.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.617
Yeah, I'm gonna come
with you, actually.

03:38.685 --> 03:39.818
-What?
-What?

03:42.254 --> 03:43.588
You're not gonna
leave a tip

03:43.655 --> 03:46.724
or at least pay
for your drink?

03:46.792 --> 03:48.294
Great.

03:52.131 --> 03:55.234
You know what, Noah?
I don't even think she was the one.

03:55.300 --> 03:59.471
Yeah, mine neither.
Definitely not the one.

04:08.381 --> 04:12.116
Why both our names? It should just be
your name. You're the painter.

04:12.183 --> 04:15.486
Yeah, but it was our idea.

04:12.183 --> 04:15.486
Yeah, but you're
actually talented.

04:15.554 --> 04:16.988
You shouldn't even be
working here.

04:17.055 --> 04:19.491
You know what? You could be
a millionaire painter,

04:19.559 --> 04:22.662
like... like Picasso
or even Banksy.

04:22.728 --> 04:24.062
Yeah, I'll get
right on that.

04:24.129 --> 04:25.730
The guys need to see this.

04:30.970 --> 04:32.538
It's a great painting.

04:32.603 --> 04:34.639
I mean, for a fisting
bro spray.

04:34.706 --> 04:37.442
Last week, I was painting a top
hat on a condom, and now this.

04:37.509 --> 04:38.710
Maybe I ought to just,
like, you know,

04:38.776 --> 04:40.545
quit my job,
be, like, a real artist.

04:40.612 --> 04:43.382
I don't know.
Do you like food and shelter?

04:43.449 --> 04:45.418
I do.
I love those things.

04:45.483 --> 04:47.586
I literally need them
every day.

04:47.653 --> 04:49.588
-All the time.
-Really?

04:49.654 --> 04:51.623
Ooh.

04:51.690 --> 04:53.191
Fascinating.

04:53.259 --> 04:55.561
A scathing satire
of the homoerotic world

04:55.627 --> 04:58.229
of faux masculinity
and fraternal life,

04:58.297 --> 05:00.432
an American cover-up
hoisted upon young men

05:00.499 --> 05:03.703
to capably deny their desire
for the fist.

05:03.769 --> 05:05.971
How's the website looking,
programmer?

05:06.038 --> 05:10.641
PoundTheFistFeelTheMist.com
is up and running.

05:10.709 --> 05:12.578
Pound the fist,
feel the mist.

05:12.644 --> 05:14.579
The bro community's
gonna love that.

05:14.646 --> 05:15.646
I agree.

05:15.713 --> 05:17.115
Derrick, Matthias,
do we have a theme

05:17.182 --> 05:18.484
for our promo party?

05:18.550 --> 05:19.951
Oh, we're gonna need
some more time.

05:20.019 --> 05:21.120
We had some ideas,

05:21.187 --> 05:23.055
but they were
a little bit...

05:23.122 --> 05:24.288
raunchy?

05:24.355 --> 05:25.658
Oh, wow.

05:25.723 --> 05:27.325
I'm gonna go ahead and say

05:27.391 --> 05:29.562
that even a little raunchy
is not okay.

05:29.627 --> 05:32.531
Well, it's a giant, veiny fist
called Tight. I love it.

05:32.598 --> 05:34.199
Remember our motto:

05:34.266 --> 05:36.134
"We give the customers
what they want."

05:36.201 --> 05:38.504
That's not really
a motto.

05:38.569 --> 05:40.471
It's kind of just
what businesses do.

05:40.538 --> 05:42.307
Okay, let's just get
this model made

05:42.374 --> 05:44.377
of Noah and Ford's design
and test it.

05:44.442 --> 05:46.110
-Yes, sir.
-You got it.

05:46.177 --> 05:47.646
Let's go.
Hmm? Come on.

05:47.713 --> 05:49.415
Oh, just us?
All right.

05:49.480 --> 05:51.416
We'll work on that.

05:52.485 --> 05:54.620
I'm already done with my work.

05:58.925 --> 06:01.560
<i>Every day after work, we like
to meet up for happy hour.</i>

06:01.627 --> 06:03.194
<i>The happiest thing
about this place</i>

06:03.262 --> 06:04.764
<i>is that girl.</i>

06:04.831 --> 06:07.199
<i>Ford likes to call her NGH
for Never Gonna Happen,</i>

06:07.266 --> 06:08.801
<i>because, well, after a year,</i>

06:08.867 --> 06:10.935
<i>I have yet to figure out
how to make a move.</i>

06:11.002 --> 06:13.572
<i>Even Jess has more game
than me.</i>

06:13.639 --> 06:16.341
When was the last time
you had a one-night stand?

06:16.408 --> 06:17.843
Yesterday.

06:19.278 --> 06:21.447
I had to have some.

06:21.512 --> 06:24.483
So I opened my phone
and swiped right.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.085
-Mm.
-We met for coffee.

06:26.151 --> 06:28.219
I took him back to my place,

06:28.286 --> 06:29.887
introduced him to the roommates,

06:29.954 --> 06:31.589
got the go-ahead,

06:31.656 --> 06:34.859
so I brought him back into my room
and closed the door.

06:34.927 --> 06:35.895
And?

06:35.961 --> 06:37.262
Adult stuff happened.

06:37.329 --> 06:39.031
That's all I'm gonna say.

06:39.098 --> 06:40.264
-Ooh!
-What?

06:40.331 --> 06:41.834
And then I asked him
to leave,

06:41.901 --> 06:43.735
because I like
eating dinner alone.

06:43.802 --> 06:45.704
-That's how it's done.
-Can we stop talking about me?

06:45.771 --> 06:47.072
Derrick, let's talk about you.

06:47.139 --> 06:48.139
Last night.

06:48.206 --> 06:49.341
-No.
-Wait, what?

06:49.408 --> 06:50.809
-What about your boyfriend?
-Oh, he knows.

06:50.875 --> 06:53.145
But we live by
what's called gay law.

06:53.211 --> 06:54.413
What is that?

06:54.480 --> 06:55.814
We're listening.

06:55.880 --> 06:57.482
So Carlos and I
love each other,

06:57.550 --> 06:59.350
but we're dudes,

06:59.418 --> 07:01.086
and we do what dudes do,
and...

07:01.153 --> 07:03.187
So technically, you guys
can have a threesome

07:03.254 --> 07:04.456
whenever you want.

07:04.523 --> 07:06.091
Like, you can literally
see a guy at a bar

07:06.158 --> 07:08.627
and say, "That guy"
and go home and bang.

07:08.694 --> 07:10.329
-And we do.
-That's it.

07:10.396 --> 07:12.064
I want to be gay.

07:12.129 --> 07:13.432
It's so progressive.

07:13.499 --> 07:14.934
I don't think
that's how it works.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.235
It works for him.
Perfect, bam.

07:16.300 --> 07:18.704
So nobody gets hurt?

07:18.771 --> 07:21.007
Okay, getting hurt
is not out of the question,

07:21.072 --> 07:23.541
but for us, it's not like
you straight weirdos.

07:23.608 --> 07:26.010
You must learn
to press past your fears.

07:26.077 --> 07:27.912
When you do, life will
unfold before you

07:27.980 --> 07:29.648
in the most beautiful
of ways.

07:29.714 --> 07:31.817
I once mercy-banged
an elderly Scottish woman.

07:31.884 --> 07:33.418
Saved my life.

07:33.485 --> 07:35.454
Okay, that's a story
I want to hear about.

07:35.519 --> 07:37.022
-Yeah.
-Pictures.

07:37.088 --> 07:38.524
I'm just not, like,

07:38.589 --> 07:40.959
a "hit on a girl
at a bar" kind of guy.

07:41.026 --> 07:43.963
We know; it's 'cause you're
a "get in a relationship

07:44.029 --> 07:46.231
"and then get broken up with
and then cry about it

07:46.298 --> 07:47.965
to your friends"
kind of guy.

07:48.033 --> 07:49.502
That is so harsh.

07:49.567 --> 07:51.302
Bye, baby.

07:51.370 --> 07:52.805
How could you do that?

07:52.870 --> 07:54.240
You just lost your chance.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.574
I should have talked
to her.

07:55.641 --> 07:57.843
Noah, you have to take
some swings.

07:57.910 --> 07:59.645
Otherwise, it's always
gonna be like prom.

07:59.711 --> 08:02.480
Noah was standing in a corner
in a bad-fitting suit

08:02.548 --> 08:04.649
looking all desperate
and sad and pathetic.

08:04.716 --> 08:06.351
My suit fit very well.

08:06.418 --> 08:08.387
That's it.

08:08.454 --> 08:12.124
What is more sexual for the American
adolescents than the senior prom?

08:13.459 --> 08:17.797
We will create
a prom night for this Tight.

08:17.862 --> 08:19.064
Hmm?

08:25.237 --> 08:26.472
Sir.

08:26.538 --> 08:28.940
Have you tried Tight
by Bro Spray?

08:29.007 --> 08:30.341
It's free.

08:34.113 --> 08:35.580
So excited.

08:35.647 --> 08:37.216
You guys having
a good time tonight?

08:37.282 --> 08:38.917
Are you texting a hot guy?

08:38.984 --> 08:41.653
No, I'm actually
making an app.

08:41.721 --> 08:43.923
It's like... okay, you take
a picture of your face,

08:43.989 --> 08:46.524
and then you scroll this bar
farther and farther,

08:46.591 --> 08:48.226
and you get older and older
until you're dead.

08:48.293 --> 08:51.496
And then you can scroll
backwards till you're a fetus.

08:51.562 --> 08:54.098
Wow, that's...
amazing.

08:54.166 --> 08:55.768
It's only working
to middle age right now,

08:55.833 --> 08:58.069
but you'll be dead
before you know it.

08:58.135 --> 08:58.971
Oh.

08:59.038 --> 09:00.772
On the app,
not in real life.

09:00.839 --> 09:02.541
I think you're great alive.

09:02.606 --> 09:03.541
That's great.

09:03.607 --> 09:04.942
People are waiting.

09:05.009 --> 09:06.912
You need to get out there
and test the waters,

09:06.979 --> 09:09.048
see how the Tight water
is floating.

09:09.114 --> 09:11.417
Don't be the kitty
afraid of the titty.

09:11.484 --> 09:14.353
Go milk.
Ha!

09:14.419 --> 09:16.087
He likes to punch me.

09:16.154 --> 09:17.155
Oh!

09:17.222 --> 09:19.056
It's Bro Spray.
Really?

09:19.124 --> 09:20.358
Ooh, that's awful.

09:20.424 --> 09:21.959
It smells like...

09:22.027 --> 09:23.895
-It smells like...
-Good stuff.

09:23.961 --> 09:27.198
No, like, Fruit Stripe gum
mixed with, like, hot tar.

09:27.265 --> 09:28.466
It's what we're selling.

09:28.533 --> 09:30.101
Get out there
and holler at the honeys

09:30.168 --> 09:32.002
or whatever it is
you frat boys do.

09:32.070 --> 09:33.939
Make it look like
this stuff works.

09:34.005 --> 09:35.574
Ford out.

09:37.308 --> 09:39.278
Could I take you up
on that killing offer?

09:39.344 --> 09:40.778
I thought you'd never ask.

09:40.846 --> 09:43.481
I know it was awkward before,
but yes, sure, definitely.

09:43.548 --> 09:44.917
Let's do that.

09:44.984 --> 09:47.086
But have a little fun first.

09:47.153 --> 09:48.353
Good luck.

09:48.419 --> 09:50.188
Yeah.

09:50.989 --> 09:52.824
What is that great smell?

09:52.890 --> 09:54.392
Oh, it's me.

09:54.458 --> 09:55.794
Here, smell, smell.

09:55.860 --> 09:57.629
Oh, you look like a girl
that wants to smell me.

09:57.696 --> 09:58.629
Come here, girl.

09:58.697 --> 09:59.798
Hello, miss.

09:59.865 --> 10:02.033
I am wearing a sexual fragrance,

10:02.100 --> 10:04.101
and I... yeah.

10:04.168 --> 10:07.805
It comes in a little fist.
How cute is that? Pound it.

10:07.873 --> 10:10.275
This is the essence of bro.
It's eau de bro.

10:10.341 --> 10:14.212
It... is that gross? You're right. I
wouldn't want that on my body either.

10:18.750 --> 10:20.918
Beautiful,
beautiful work, boys.

10:20.985 --> 10:24.590
Tight is gonna flip a biscuit
when they hear about this.

10:24.657 --> 10:26.391
Thank you.

10:26.457 --> 10:27.692
Great.

10:27.759 --> 10:29.226
How was your reaction
to the smell?

10:29.293 --> 10:32.298
Oh, it was great. It was just,
you know, pure animal attraction.

10:32.364 --> 10:34.567
Just women just coming at me,
and I had to, you know,

10:34.633 --> 10:36.268
get them away.

10:36.335 --> 10:39.138
When was the last time
you ejaculated inside of a woman?

10:39.205 --> 10:40.172
Excuse me?

10:40.239 --> 10:41.072
No, no.

10:41.139 --> 10:42.741
Noah here
is a serial monogamist.

10:42.807 --> 10:44.576
He's only had sex
with himself.

10:44.643 --> 10:46.378
-Or a girl.
-In his dreams.

10:46.445 --> 10:49.148
I swear to God
I've had sex.

10:49.215 --> 10:50.149
It's okay.

10:50.216 --> 10:51.716
I know what it is
to be celibate.

10:51.783 --> 10:53.418
I...
That's the thing, though.

10:53.485 --> 10:54.686
I'm not celibate.

10:54.753 --> 10:56.655
-Shh, shh.
-I'm really not.

10:58.157 --> 11:01.026
I have a long and very
turbulent sexual history,

11:01.092 --> 11:02.495
to the point where, honestly,

11:02.561 --> 11:06.799
doing the sticky-stuckus
has grown quite passé for me.

11:06.865 --> 11:09.067
I prefer the intensity
of a good dream.

11:09.134 --> 11:10.936
-Oh.
-Especially a sticky one.

11:11.003 --> 11:13.705
I've trained my mind
to control them.

11:13.772 --> 11:17.209
The ecstasy of a lucid
midnight emission,

11:17.275 --> 11:19.209
ooh, incomparable.

11:19.277 --> 11:21.413
I will partner with you
and show you how.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.014
Oh, I'm...

11:23.081 --> 11:26.018
-Take me up on it.
-I think I'm okay.

11:26.085 --> 11:27.853
-I will show you.
-Okay.

11:27.918 --> 11:28.986
I think he has
the hots for you.

11:29.053 --> 11:30.521
I don't know about that.

11:30.589 --> 11:32.858
Listen, me and Jess are about
to go out for some drinks.

11:32.924 --> 11:34.024
You want to come?

11:34.091 --> 11:35.894
Uh, no.
You guys go have fun.

11:35.961 --> 11:37.395
I think
I'm gonna just stay here

11:37.462 --> 11:38.896
and wallow
in my self-loathing.

11:38.964 --> 11:41.300
All right, good.
Get some practice in, all right?

11:41.366 --> 11:42.500
Thank you.

11:42.567 --> 11:44.001
Love you.
Bye.

11:44.068 --> 11:45.536
Oh, dude,
you smell horrible.

11:45.604 --> 11:48.007
We all smell horrible.
That's Tight.

11:48.072 --> 11:49.442
Go.
Have a good night.

11:50.841 --> 11:52.444
Ooh, he's not wrong.

11:54.145 --> 11:56.413
<i>Well, the promo party's
an epic disaster,</i>

11:56.480 --> 11:57.982
<i>on top of which I've designed</i>

11:58.048 --> 12:00.019
<i>the world's worst-smelling
body spray,</i>

12:00.085 --> 12:03.322
<i>and it's just my luck, while
destroying my monstrosity,</i>

12:03.388 --> 12:05.290
<i>that's when I met Callie.</i>

12:05.356 --> 12:08.058
Damn, what did those bottles
ever do to you?

12:08.125 --> 12:10.795
Could the concept be douchier?

12:10.861 --> 12:12.264
Uh...

12:12.330 --> 12:14.899
Kind of hard to believe
that someone actually made this.

12:14.966 --> 12:16.668
Yeah, well, someone did.

12:16.735 --> 12:18.236
And that someone is you?

12:18.302 --> 12:20.304
That someone is me.

12:20.371 --> 12:23.442
Do you mind if I take
a picture of you?

12:23.509 --> 12:24.475
-Uh...
-With this?

12:24.543 --> 12:26.378
I... um...

12:26.445 --> 12:27.546
Okay.

12:27.613 --> 12:28.814
Take your glasses off.

12:28.880 --> 12:31.015
You're handsome.
Embrace it.

12:31.081 --> 12:33.451
You should wear contacts.

12:33.519 --> 12:35.120
Ready?

12:35.187 --> 12:37.556
Sadder.

12:37.623 --> 12:40.191
Sadder.

12:43.427 --> 12:44.895
Perfect.

12:44.962 --> 12:47.665
Well, I hope to see
more of your work someday.

12:47.732 --> 12:49.501
Yeah?

12:49.567 --> 12:51.436
Hey, I'm Noah.

12:51.503 --> 12:53.238
I'm Callie.

12:53.304 --> 12:55.573
Callie.

12:55.639 --> 12:58.610
Could I get your...

12:58.677 --> 13:00.379
e-mail or something?

13:00.445 --> 13:03.048
No, I have a better idea.

13:03.115 --> 13:04.883
This party's amazing!

13:04.950 --> 13:07.019
I'm so excited!

13:11.389 --> 13:12.825
Wow.

13:12.890 --> 13:15.159
Secret party.

13:16.327 --> 13:17.962
What?

13:34.980 --> 13:37.416
I like this one of you.

13:37.481 --> 13:39.550
I have a visible erection.

13:39.618 --> 13:41.520
-Really?
-No.

13:41.586 --> 13:44.122
Oh, then I'm not interested.

13:44.188 --> 13:45.890
Oh.

13:45.957 --> 13:48.459
I like you.

13:48.525 --> 13:50.295
Why?

13:50.361 --> 13:51.629
You keep it low-key.

13:51.696 --> 13:53.298
You're like an iceberg.

13:53.365 --> 13:55.133
There's stuff
below the surface.

13:55.200 --> 13:56.335
I'm pretty sure
it's just ice

13:56.402 --> 13:58.270
beneath the surface
of an iceberg.

14:22.760 --> 14:24.995
Praise hands, everybody.
Come on.

14:25.062 --> 14:26.631
Come on.
Feel the spirit.

14:26.697 --> 14:28.100
Or not.

14:28.167 --> 14:30.168
But let's all be thankful today,

14:30.235 --> 14:33.437
because the client bought
our prom campaign for Tight.

14:33.504 --> 14:34.373
-Yeah.
-All right.

14:34.440 --> 14:36.041
Now, due to my faith,

14:36.107 --> 14:38.142
Tight isn't a product
I personally endorse,

14:38.210 --> 14:40.112
as it encourages sex
before marriage,

14:40.177 --> 14:41.980
as well as
its subtle endorsement

14:42.047 --> 14:43.415
that sodomy is A-okay.

14:43.481 --> 14:44.882
But we're still young
as a business,

14:44.948 --> 14:47.284
need to take it all.

14:47.351 --> 14:49.153
Uh, I did not mean that
sexually.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.256
Well, I take everything
sexually.

14:51.322 --> 14:52.490
All the time.

14:53.924 --> 14:55.826
Okay, well,
now for some great news.

14:55.894 --> 14:57.028
We just heard from Converse,

14:57.095 --> 14:58.497
and they want to do
a promotional event

14:58.563 --> 15:00.466
here in town,
and they want us to pitch.

15:00.532 --> 15:01.667
What's the strategy?

15:01.734 --> 15:02.901
Urban adventure.

15:02.967 --> 15:04.636
So I want everyone
to put your heads together

15:04.702 --> 15:06.538
and just come up with something
outside the box.

15:06.605 --> 15:08.440
I really think we can
blow Converse away.

15:12.177 --> 15:14.346
Uh, how about
a city-wide scavenger hunt

15:14.413 --> 15:17.481
with clues that lead people
all over the city?

15:17.548 --> 15:19.617
There'd be, like, a goal
at the end or a treasure,

15:19.684 --> 15:22.720
like a one-of-a-kind pair
of golden Converse.

15:22.788 --> 15:25.323
I could do the art,
have Ford talk to manufacturing,

15:25.390 --> 15:27.291
Jess builds the app,
Derrick shoots the spot,

15:27.359 --> 15:28.960
and Matthias writes the copy.

15:29.027 --> 15:31.797
Noah, I am blown away.

15:31.864 --> 15:33.998
This idea just might be
your ark.

15:34.065 --> 15:35.334
As in Noah's ark?

15:35.400 --> 15:36.734
Yeah, we saw it.

15:36.801 --> 15:38.003
With Russell Crowe.

15:38.070 --> 15:39.938
You... no, you got
to read the story.

15:40.004 --> 15:41.472
In... in the book.

15:41.539 --> 15:43.341
We don't see it
with the Russell Crowe,

15:43.408 --> 15:44.208
but he's in it.

15:44.275 --> 15:46.444
Okay.
You know what?

15:46.511 --> 15:48.979
Good job, Noah, okay?

15:49.047 --> 15:50.181
-All right!
-Dude!

15:50.248 --> 15:51.917
I have never seen you so on.

15:51.982 --> 15:53.150
I know, right?

15:53.217 --> 15:54.586
Okay, can I tell you
a secret?

15:54.653 --> 15:56.053
Of course.

15:56.120 --> 15:58.323
I kind of met a girl.

15:59.725 --> 16:01.993
Like, a real good-looking lady.

16:02.059 --> 16:03.294
Does... does she know you?

16:03.360 --> 16:04.962
Yeah, yeah, dude.
She knows me.

16:05.028 --> 16:06.764
We... we kissed.

16:06.831 --> 16:08.700
What?
That's awesome.

16:08.767 --> 16:09.834
We can go on a double date now.

16:09.900 --> 16:10.835
Yeah.
Wait, hold on.

16:10.902 --> 16:11.936
You're seeing someone too?

16:12.003 --> 16:13.238
I don't want to jinx it,

16:13.303 --> 16:15.072
but tomorrow afternoon,
I have a date,

16:15.139 --> 16:16.875
and I'm completely into her.

16:16.942 --> 16:18.476
Yes!
I love it.

16:18.543 --> 16:19.510
Dude, that's awesome.

16:19.576 --> 16:20.511
Okay.
See, man?

16:20.578 --> 16:22.045
Shit's really turned around
for us.

16:22.113 --> 16:23.215
Bloo, bloo, bloo!

16:23.282 --> 16:25.984
You know what?
I really like this place.

16:26.051 --> 16:27.686
I mean, this is so much
different

16:27.751 --> 16:29.120
than my normal first dates

16:29.187 --> 16:31.155
that I really appreciate this,
so thank you.

16:31.222 --> 16:32.289
You're welcome.

16:32.356 --> 16:33.692
I'd normally invite you over,

16:33.759 --> 16:36.928
you know, pour some wine,
make some popcorn.

16:36.995 --> 16:39.465
You know, sit on the couch,
start cuddling,

16:39.530 --> 16:41.532
put on some Netflix,

16:41.600 --> 16:43.701
and then you know,
start... start chilling.

16:43.769 --> 16:45.003
Is this on your first date?

16:45.070 --> 16:46.471
I mean, usually,

16:46.538 --> 16:48.507
'cause there usually isn't
a second, so...

16:48.573 --> 16:49.506
Oh, okay.

16:49.573 --> 16:50.808
To be 100% honest,

16:50.875 --> 16:52.310
I'm really glad
you took me here.

16:52.378 --> 16:53.945
I don't normally get
to see things like this.

16:54.011 --> 16:54.979
-Really?
-Yeah.

16:55.047 --> 16:56.114
You're not just saying that?

16:56.179 --> 16:57.214
No, the girl never usually

16:57.282 --> 16:58.283
takes me on a date like this.

16:58.350 --> 16:59.884
Look at this.
Look at this.

16:59.951 --> 17:02.086
I mean, trees smell nice.

17:02.153 --> 17:03.955
I'm just messing.
I'm happy to be here with you.

17:04.021 --> 17:05.589
-It's cute.
-Here it is.

17:06.924 --> 17:08.125
We're gonna do it here?

17:08.192 --> 17:10.127
<i>-Ni hao ma.
-Ni hao ma.</i>

17:10.194 --> 17:12.762
<i>That's awesome!
It said,"Ni hao ma."</i>

17:12.829 --> 17:14.365
What does that mean?

17:14.432 --> 17:15.531
Oh, I don't know.
I don't speak Chinese.

17:15.598 --> 17:17.701
I just mimic birds
who speak Chinese.

17:17.769 --> 17:19.037
<i>-Ni hao ma.
-Okay.</i>

17:24.540 --> 17:26.410
<i>Guys, the miracles
keep on coming.</i>

17:26.478 --> 17:29.214
Converse likes Noah's treasure hunt.
They want to hear more.

17:29.280 --> 17:32.015
So in the next couple weeks,
we're gonna do a formal pitch.

17:32.083 --> 17:34.119
I'd like to do the pitch.
With Ford.

17:34.185 --> 17:35.919
Okay, you guys got it.

17:35.987 --> 17:39.257
Oh, uh, and in other pieces
of news,

17:39.324 --> 17:40.592
as of last night,

17:40.659 --> 17:43.194
Marta and I
are officially engaged.

17:45.163 --> 17:47.331
So I think a little celebration
is in order,

17:47.398 --> 17:49.667
so everyone please
join us for cake.

17:49.734 --> 17:52.102
All right.

17:52.170 --> 17:54.138
It's Marta, not Martha.

17:54.204 --> 17:55.973
They're both good names.

17:56.039 --> 17:58.409
This is like barf-a.

17:58.476 --> 18:01.179
You must be so psyched
to get married.

18:01.246 --> 18:02.480
It's a blessed union.

18:02.547 --> 18:04.281
Yeah, but I mean more so
for the, you know,

18:04.348 --> 18:06.518
getting to have sex
for the first time thing.

18:06.585 --> 18:09.254
And then hopefully
a lot more times after that.

18:09.320 --> 18:13.257
Oh, well, I won't lie;
I'm a hot-blooded male too.

18:13.325 --> 18:15.460
But as you know, I have
a strong religious center.

18:15.527 --> 18:17.496
Otherwise,
I'm just like you.

18:17.561 --> 18:19.530
Well, let me recommend
some slow jams,

18:19.596 --> 18:21.699
you know, so you can
bump and grind and

18:21.766 --> 18:24.035
ah, ah, ah.

18:24.102 --> 18:26.371
Tell me about this new girl.

18:26.438 --> 18:29.040
Well, it's only been
a few dates so far.

18:29.106 --> 18:30.441
I don't want to, you know,
say too much.

18:30.508 --> 18:32.778
You've literally said nothing.

18:32.845 --> 18:35.279
Oh, well, I think
that may be for the best.

18:35.346 --> 18:37.583
I... I get so nervous
talking about her.

18:37.648 --> 18:39.483
I mean, and my hands
get sweaty.

18:39.550 --> 18:41.019
-Feel them.
-I believe you.

18:41.085 --> 18:43.421
Yeah. I don't know.
She's really cool.

18:43.488 --> 18:45.490
She's, like, creative...
like, very creative...

18:45.557 --> 18:47.459
but in, like,
a really nonpretentious way.

18:47.525 --> 18:49.261
Yeah, of course.
She's very hot.

18:49.326 --> 18:51.096
And she's actually
pretty smart.

18:51.163 --> 18:52.697
And she's dating you?

18:52.763 --> 18:53.798
I know.
Right?

18:53.865 --> 18:55.133
I'm, like, totally smitten,

18:55.200 --> 18:56.335
but I got to be careful
about it,

18:56.401 --> 18:59.805
because I think she is maybe
seeing another guy.

18:59.871 --> 19:01.038
Well, we haven't discussed

19:01.105 --> 19:02.840
the whole exclusivity thing
at this point.

19:02.907 --> 19:05.175
She said she's open
to just dating one person.

19:05.242 --> 19:06.610
Don't have that conversation.

19:06.678 --> 19:08.012
-No?
-No.

19:08.078 --> 19:09.614
Exclusivity.

19:09.681 --> 19:11.316
So I don't know.

19:11.382 --> 19:14.219
I mean, I don't... I don't want
to sound too confident,

19:14.286 --> 19:16.721
but I think there's, like,
a 50/50 chance

19:16.788 --> 19:18.589
that guy could be me.

19:18.656 --> 19:20.591
50/50, yeah.

19:20.659 --> 19:23.729
Not to worry.
That wasn't too confident.

19:23.795 --> 19:25.430
I think you're good.

19:26.596 --> 19:27.565
Yo.

19:27.632 --> 19:29.167
So I heard you
telling Derrick

19:29.232 --> 19:30.935
this girl of yours
likes whiskey?

19:31.002 --> 19:32.136
Mine too.

19:32.203 --> 19:33.271
What else about yours?

19:33.337 --> 19:36.642
Uh, well, she is
pretty bad-ass.

19:36.708 --> 19:39.344
Oh, trust me, mine is
the definition of bad-ass.

19:39.411 --> 19:41.278
And she knows how
to make me laugh.

19:41.346 --> 19:42.713
She's so funny.

19:42.779 --> 19:43.648
Ooh, mine too.

19:43.714 --> 19:45.316
But get this.
Mine rides horses.

19:45.383 --> 19:46.750
Okay, mine rides horses.

19:46.817 --> 19:49.953
But she doesn't know how
to ride a bike.

19:50.020 --> 19:53.457
Mine had a tiny Chihuahua
when she was little named J.Lo.

19:53.525 --> 19:55.793
J.Lo.

19:57.028 --> 20:00.198
Yeah, um, mine did too.

20:00.265 --> 20:03.134
Mine's 5 feet...

20:03.201 --> 20:05.269
7 inches tall?

20:05.336 --> 20:06.939
-Takes...
-Boxing classes.

20:07.005 --> 20:09.107
-Eats...
-Chili lime chips.

20:09.173 --> 20:10.842
-Wears...
-Adorable red sneakers.

20:10.909 --> 20:12.644
What is happening to us?

20:18.650 --> 20:20.819
Noah?

20:20.884 --> 20:22.119
Look, this is gonna hurt,

20:22.185 --> 20:24.722
but one of us
has to stop seeing her.

20:24.788 --> 20:25.923
Dude, come on.

20:25.990 --> 20:27.725
You know a girl like this
is not coming along

20:27.792 --> 20:29.560
in either of our lives
ever again.

20:29.627 --> 20:30.627
Maybe.

20:30.694 --> 20:33.397
But she came into
both of our lives

20:33.464 --> 20:35.199
at the same time.

20:35.267 --> 20:37.201
Yeah.

20:37.269 --> 20:39.371
All right, you know what?
Let's be fair.

20:39.438 --> 20:41.038
Both of us
have to stop seeing her.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.976
It's the only way
we'll survive this, Noah.

20:45.042 --> 20:48.412
I...

20:48.480 --> 20:51.016
Okay, fine, sure.

20:52.483 --> 20:54.051
I'll do it first.

20:54.118 --> 20:55.919
What's up?

20:55.987 --> 20:58.757
I can't believe I'm doing this.
Um, I have to...

20:59.857 --> 21:01.259
I don't really know
how to say this.

21:01.326 --> 21:04.261
-I'm sorry.
-Okay.

21:04.328 --> 21:05.296
-Great.
-What?

21:05.363 --> 21:06.965
My friend bailed on me.

21:07.030 --> 21:09.400
We were supposed to go mushroom
hunting, and now she can't make it.

21:09.468 --> 21:11.102
Excuse me. What?
Mushroom hunting?

21:11.169 --> 21:13.438
I mean, we go hunting
for mushrooms,

21:13.505 --> 21:14.606
and we eat them.

21:14.673 --> 21:16.007
You're amazing.

21:16.074 --> 21:17.240
-Noah.
-Hmm?

21:17.307 --> 21:18.509
Would you want to go with me?

21:18.576 --> 21:21.045
I... I do love mushrooms.

21:21.112 --> 21:22.346
It's pretty cool.

21:22.413 --> 21:24.115
Well, I mean, I can...
there's a...

21:24.182 --> 21:26.817
Please, yes.
I would love to.

21:27.986 --> 21:29.287
Here you go, sir.

21:29.354 --> 21:31.923
Callie?

21:33.290 --> 21:34.625
I'm breaking up with you.

21:34.692 --> 21:37.228
Me and Noah just...
you know, we can't...

21:37.295 --> 21:39.298
we can't keep...

21:40.365 --> 21:42.799
Oh, my.

21:42.866 --> 21:44.402
I'm screwed.

21:44.469 --> 21:46.004
Okay, so what happened?

21:49.339 --> 21:50.808
You didn't break it off.

21:50.875 --> 21:52.477
I didn't break it off.

21:52.544 --> 21:54.245
Noah, it was hard.

21:54.311 --> 21:55.713
I know!
It's impossible!

21:55.779 --> 21:58.482
She's sexy
and loves mushroom hunting.

21:58.548 --> 22:00.519
Ugh, it's like someone
invented the perfect girl

22:00.585 --> 22:02.086
just to torture us.

22:02.153 --> 22:03.421
You didn't break it off.

22:03.488 --> 22:05.323
No, of course
I didn't break it off!

22:05.390 --> 22:06.825
I'm mortal!

22:09.160 --> 22:11.528
Okay.
All right, look.

22:11.596 --> 22:13.365
What if I said
I had an idea?

22:13.432 --> 22:15.400
Now, it's gonna sound
completely crazy, but just...

22:15.465 --> 22:17.067
Nope, I'm not flipping
a coin for her.

22:17.134 --> 22:18.435
No!

22:18.502 --> 22:20.003
Can we both agree
that if we stop dating her,

22:20.070 --> 22:21.772
some inferior jerk
who doesn't deserve her

22:21.839 --> 22:23.807
is gonna swoop in
and start dating her anyway?

22:23.874 --> 22:25.143
Yes.

22:25.209 --> 22:26.277
You know
what happens then, Noah?

22:26.344 --> 22:28.413
-Uh...
-We both lose.

22:28.480 --> 22:31.682
-Right.
-But what if...

22:31.749 --> 22:33.552
we don't stop dating her?

22:34.786 --> 22:36.388
I'm sorry.
I'm not following.

22:36.453 --> 22:38.055
We share her.

22:38.122 --> 22:39.891
-What?
-We joint-date her.

22:39.958 --> 22:41.392
It'll all be aboveboard.

22:41.459 --> 22:43.628
Let's back up.
I think that is literally...

22:43.693 --> 22:45.328
and I mean this
without exaggeration...

22:45.395 --> 22:48.231
the worst idea
I've ever heard.

22:48.298 --> 22:49.701
And we work in advertising.

22:49.767 --> 22:52.036
-Is it, though?
-Yeah.

22:52.103 --> 22:53.471
-But is it?
-Yes!

22:53.538 --> 22:55.205
I mean, she's gonna end up
liking one of us more,

22:55.272 --> 22:56.674
probably you, and this...

22:56.741 --> 22:58.375
oh, man, this whole thing
is way too weird.

22:58.442 --> 23:01.078
-It's not that weird.
-It's that weird.

23:01.145 --> 23:03.413
People date more than
one person all the time.

23:03.480 --> 23:05.383
The difference is
they're not honest about it.

23:05.450 --> 23:07.751
We're best friends;
we'll be so honest.

23:07.818 --> 23:09.486
Yeah, I'll just tell her,
"Honestly, Callie,

23:09.554 --> 23:10.922
"Ford and I are best friends,

23:10.989 --> 23:13.857
which is why we are gonna
double-team you."

23:13.924 --> 23:15.226
-Yeah!
-What?

23:15.292 --> 23:17.194
That's actually
the perfect situation.

23:17.261 --> 23:20.597
What do guys complain about most in
a relationship? Not enough space.

23:20.664 --> 23:23.434
What do girls complain about?
Not enough attention.

23:23.500 --> 23:25.569
This way, we'll get
double the space.

23:25.636 --> 23:28.338
She'll get double the beef.
She might be into it.

23:28.405 --> 23:30.942
She's not like other girls.

23:31.009 --> 23:33.211
She's from Venezuela.

23:33.278 --> 23:34.613
That doesn't mean anything!

23:34.679 --> 23:36.447
Everything about this
is absurd.

23:36.513 --> 23:39.116
The point is,
I don't want to lose her.

23:39.183 --> 23:41.051
Yeah, I don't want
to lose her.

23:41.452 --> 23:42.953
Shit!

23:45.123 --> 23:46.524
Venezuela.

23:46.590 --> 23:49.125
Yeah, I heard you
the first time.

23:51.061 --> 23:52.529
Okay.
Okay, look.

23:52.596 --> 23:54.331
Ah!

23:54.398 --> 23:56.733
I'll do this
but on one condition.

23:56.800 --> 23:59.636
I stop using
your work computer for porn.

23:59.702 --> 24:00.872
That would be a good idea,

24:00.938 --> 24:04.642
but also if she dumps
one of us,

24:04.709 --> 24:06.978
then the other person
has to break it off.

24:07.044 --> 24:08.947
It's all or nothing.

24:09.013 --> 24:10.581
You won't regret this.

24:10.647 --> 24:11.815
Yeah, I won't regret this.

24:11.882 --> 24:13.584
Of course
I'm gonna regret this.

24:13.651 --> 24:15.452
We're gonna... -
dude, don't dance like that.

24:15.519 --> 24:16.788
You know we're gonna
freak her out.

24:16.855 --> 24:18.522
Nothing about this is good.

24:20.525 --> 24:22.294
God, I hate him.

24:22.359 --> 24:24.295
Noah, just be cool.

24:24.362 --> 24:25.630
No, I'm being cool.

24:25.695 --> 24:27.397
Look, dude,
we got to get out of here.

24:27.464 --> 24:28.799
She's gonna come any minute.

24:28.866 --> 24:31.235
-I can't...
-She's coming.

24:32.368 --> 24:33.404
Hey!

24:33.471 --> 24:35.774
Hey.

24:35.839 --> 24:37.240
Hey.

24:37.307 --> 24:38.776
Noah?

24:38.843 --> 24:40.077
Yeah.

24:41.311 --> 24:42.846
-Have a seat.
-Oh.

24:42.913 --> 24:44.414
Funny story.

24:44.481 --> 24:48.085
We actually found out
about each other.

24:48.152 --> 24:49.253
Really?

24:49.319 --> 24:52.123
We're actually best friends.

24:52.189 --> 24:53.557
That's weird.

24:53.624 --> 24:55.192
Well, it's about
to get weirder.

24:55.259 --> 24:59.163
We have a proposal. Noah and
I havea lot of fun with you.

24:59.230 --> 25:00.832
And you have a lot of fun
with us, right?

25:00.898 --> 25:02.433
-Yeah.
-We all have fun.

25:02.500 --> 25:04.201
So why should that
have to stop?

25:05.702 --> 25:08.038
-I'm not following.
-All right, Callie, look.

25:08.105 --> 25:11.742
Noah and I individually
are not that amazing.

25:11.808 --> 25:14.578
Wait, no.
Guys, you are amazing.

25:14.644 --> 25:16.381
Trust me on this one.
We're not.

25:16.448 --> 25:18.883
But together...
oh, together,

25:18.950 --> 25:21.352
we become, like,
this perfect boyfriend.

25:21.417 --> 25:23.587
Like a boyfriend Voltron.

25:24.622 --> 25:26.457
It's a show from the '80s.

25:26.523 --> 25:28.225
It's... never mind.

25:28.291 --> 25:32.163
Callie, Noah isn't about to jump out
of planes with you, but I am.

25:32.230 --> 25:35.665
But you know what he is gonna do?
He's gonna read books with you.

25:35.732 --> 25:38.001
He's gonna talk about art.
You know, art?

25:38.068 --> 25:39.537
And he's gonna...

25:39.603 --> 25:41.305
he's... he's gonna...

25:43.606 --> 25:45.542
But look,
what we're saying is,

25:45.609 --> 25:47.644
date both of us.

25:47.711 --> 25:49.446
But, like, at different times.

25:49.513 --> 25:52.182
We want to be
your boyfriend.

25:52.250 --> 25:53.784
Wow, um...

25:53.851 --> 25:55.253
here's the thing, guys.

25:55.319 --> 25:57.922
I want you to know
that I like you both a lot.

25:57.988 --> 26:00.691
And at this point, I would hate
to choose between you both.

26:00.758 --> 26:03.193
Then don't choose.
You don't have to.

26:03.259 --> 26:06.564
Yeah, but this three-way thing
is kind of crazy.

26:06.631 --> 26:07.832
You're right.
It's crazy. We...

26:07.898 --> 26:10.667
No, no.
But that's why I love it.

26:10.734 --> 26:11.869
-What?
-See?

26:11.935 --> 26:14.271
Yeah, I love it.
I mean, it's different

26:14.338 --> 26:16.307
from any other relationship
I've ever been in,

26:16.374 --> 26:20.177
and they've all been super bad,
so it can't be that bad, right?

26:20.243 --> 26:22.679
-No. It's not bad at all.
It's actually great. -Yeah.

26:22.747 --> 26:24.983
But aren't you guys gonna start,
like, I don't know,

26:24.984 --> 26:25.984
fighting or anything?

26:26.049 --> 26:27.451
-No, no, we're best friends.
-Yeah.

26:27.518 --> 26:28.853
We've been through
so much worse.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.354
We're good.
We've been through worse.

26:30.421 --> 26:31.756
All right.
Let's do this!

26:36.093 --> 26:38.296
What if everything feels
different now with her?

26:38.363 --> 26:39.596
It's not gonna be different.

26:39.663 --> 26:41.365
You've gone on a couple
of dates with her.

26:41.432 --> 26:42.732
They went great, right?

26:42.799 --> 26:44.134
Yeah, but now
it's, like, official.

26:44.201 --> 26:45.936
We're both, like, officially
dating the same girl,

26:46.003 --> 26:47.237
which is just gonna be awkward.

26:47.304 --> 26:48.840
It's not gonna be awkward.

26:48.905 --> 26:51.341
Just keep doing what you're doing,
and all will be fine.

26:53.243 --> 26:56.714
-All right, look. Here.
-What's this?

26:56.780 --> 26:58.982
My lucky flask. Well, one of
my lucky flasks.

26:59.049 --> 27:00.384
Just put some bourbon in it,

27:00.451 --> 27:02.686
and no matter where you are
or what you're doing,

27:02.753 --> 27:04.121
if you have that,
you'll be okay.

27:04.189 --> 27:06.725
These sound like
famous last words.

27:06.790 --> 27:09.292
Hey, assholes,
I'll take a drink.

27:09.359 --> 27:10.560
That's cute.

27:13.631 --> 27:15.733
My dad and my mom...

27:15.799 --> 27:17.467
I don't know;
they separated,

27:17.535 --> 27:19.070
and he's been gone
for a while.

27:19.136 --> 27:22.106
You know, me and my father
used to come here all the time

27:22.173 --> 27:23.073
to go fishing.

27:23.140 --> 27:24.709
I was actually
a really good fisher.

27:24.776 --> 27:26.277
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

27:26.343 --> 27:28.246
He's like my best friend.

27:28.311 --> 27:29.580
And I'm talking too much.

27:29.646 --> 27:30.647
No, no, no,
no at all.

27:30.714 --> 27:31.849
-Yes, I am!
-No, I...

27:31.915 --> 27:34.019
Look, I enjoy listening
to you.

27:46.263 --> 27:47.497
All right.

27:47.564 --> 27:49.999
-Whoa!
-This is stupid.

27:50.067 --> 27:51.702
But I love it.
I love it.

27:51.769 --> 27:53.304
Let me show you
what I got.

27:53.371 --> 27:54.705
Wait, wait.

27:57.407 --> 27:59.642
Oh!

27:59.710 --> 28:00.812
Oh, my God!

28:00.877 --> 28:02.746
-That was close.
-Wow.

28:02.814 --> 28:03.848
Have you always loved

28:03.914 --> 28:05.182
taking pictures?

28:05.249 --> 28:06.718
Yeah, I mean,
if you think about it,

28:06.784 --> 28:08.352
it's the only thing
that freezes time.

28:08.419 --> 28:10.421
Okay, maybe one day,
you'll be like, you know,

28:10.488 --> 28:11.823
a famous photographer.

28:11.888 --> 28:14.158
I mean, I would love to be
like Annie Leibovitz.

28:14.224 --> 28:15.058
You know who she is?

28:15.125 --> 28:18.229
An... Annie Leibovitz!
Yeah!

28:18.296 --> 28:19.596
She's my favorite!

28:19.663 --> 28:21.799
She's my favorite too.

28:21.865 --> 28:22.967
Noah, everything you know
about Annie Leibovitz

28:23.032 --> 28:24.902
<i>-in, like, three seconds.
-The photographer.</i>

28:24.969 --> 28:26.438
Yeah, but give me more,
because Callie brought her up

28:26.503 --> 28:28.338
in a conversation,
and I didn't know what to say.

28:28.405 --> 28:29.906
I felt like an idiot.

28:29.973 --> 28:32.108
<i>She took that famous portrait
of John Lennon and Yoko Ono</i>

28:32.175 --> 28:33.677
<i>when they're lying
in the bed naked.</i>

28:33.744 --> 28:36.313
Okay, perfect, perfect.
That's more than enough. Thank you.

28:38.182 --> 28:40.285
-Hey.
-Hey.

28:40.351 --> 28:42.152
You know what?
While you were gone, I was thinking.

28:42.219 --> 28:43.654
You know what I want to do
with you?

28:43.721 --> 28:45.155
We should re-create

28:45.222 --> 28:46.857
that famous John Lennon
and Yoko Ono picture

28:46.923 --> 28:48.259
that Annie Leibovitz took.

28:48.326 --> 28:49.594
It's, like, my favorite
picture of all time.

28:49.661 --> 28:52.563
Well, you know what?
I don't like that one that much.

28:52.630 --> 28:53.964
What others do you like?

28:54.030 --> 28:57.067
Ye... um...
I... I like the...

29:01.071 --> 29:04.541
Okay, I don't know anything
about Annie Leibovitz.

29:04.607 --> 29:07.845
I just found out that fact 'cause
I kind of wanted to impress you.

29:07.912 --> 29:11.115
-Really?
-Yeah.

29:11.182 --> 29:12.916
Well, you did.

29:18.388 --> 29:20.056
Well, it sounds like
everything is running

29:20.124 --> 29:21.525
like a German auto factory.

29:21.592 --> 29:23.795
As they say, hitchless.

29:23.861 --> 29:25.964
It's going great,
and the best part is

29:26.029 --> 29:27.331
there's no pressure.

29:27.397 --> 29:29.599
It's just pure fun.

29:29.666 --> 29:31.401
Well, I'm very happy for you.

29:31.469 --> 29:32.370
And you too, Noah.

29:32.435 --> 29:33.470
Huh?

29:33.537 --> 29:34.872
You work well together.

29:34.939 --> 29:37.609
You two are ninjas
in the same dojo.

29:37.674 --> 29:39.375
Just make sure
your swords don't cross.

29:41.511 --> 29:43.346
You told Matthias?

29:43.413 --> 29:44.382
No, I... I didn't.

29:44.448 --> 29:45.650
Then who did?

29:45.715 --> 29:47.150
Okay, yeah, I did,
but it's fine.

29:47.217 --> 29:49.653
He can give us
beneficial advice.

29:49.721 --> 29:51.355
He does weird stuff
all the time.

29:51.422 --> 29:53.057
Did you know he was
a live-in sex butler

29:53.124 --> 29:54.659
for a man and woman
in Stuttgart?

29:54.726 --> 29:55.993
So? Dude,
as soon as Ed finds out,

29:56.059 --> 29:57.628
he's gonna freak
and he's gonna fire us.

29:57.694 --> 29:59.963
He's not gonna fire us.
We've been killing it for him.

30:00.029 --> 30:01.331
Yes, he will.
Dude, he's so Christian,

30:01.398 --> 30:03.300
<i>he still watches
Veggie Tales movies.</i>

30:03.367 --> 30:04.434
He doesn't have kids.

30:04.501 --> 30:06.202
Matthias knows better
than to tell anyone.

30:06.269 --> 30:07.939
We know all his
deepest, darkest secrets.

30:08.005 --> 30:11.376
Well, well, well.
I'm impressed.

30:11.442 --> 30:14.245
I always thought of you boys
as typical straight dudes,

30:14.311 --> 30:16.913
but it turns out you're more
adventurous than I thought.

30:16.980 --> 30:19.415
Keep up the good work.

30:19.482 --> 30:23.153
You always need to get relationship
advice from your gay friend.

30:27.991 --> 30:30.894
So we should
have the talk.

30:30.961 --> 30:32.931
'Kay. What talk?

30:32.997 --> 30:34.398
The sex talk.

30:34.464 --> 30:35.798
What talk?

30:35.865 --> 30:37.468
The sex tal...
I'm asking,

30:37.535 --> 30:39.070
have you had sex
with Callie yet or not?

30:39.135 --> 30:40.336
You haven't told me, so...

30:40.403 --> 30:41.105
No, no, no!

30:41.172 --> 30:42.673
Okay, cool.
Okay.

30:42.739 --> 30:43.908
I've been taking it slow.

30:43.974 --> 30:46.376
Yeah, cool.

30:46.443 --> 30:47.644
Have you?

30:47.711 --> 30:50.315
Uh, no.

30:52.182 --> 30:53.250
Oral?

30:53.317 --> 30:55.352
Uh, uh, just kissing
so far.

30:55.419 --> 30:56.754
Okay.

30:56.820 --> 30:58.955
All right, we can't be weird
about this.

30:59.022 --> 31:00.124
Yeah, no, I know.

31:00.191 --> 31:01.692
No, like, this is
our make-or-break.

31:01.759 --> 31:03.193
One of us is gonna
get there first,

31:03.260 --> 31:05.195
and the other cannot
freak out about it.

31:05.262 --> 31:06.496
No freaking out.
Got it.

31:06.563 --> 31:07.999
But...

31:08.066 --> 31:09.667
But, like, which one of us
gets to go there first?

31:09.733 --> 31:10.968
You know what I mean?

31:11.035 --> 31:12.236
That's not our decision
to make.

31:12.301 --> 31:13.871
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, I know that.

31:13.938 --> 31:16.240
But I just wonder, like,
we could both agree to...

31:16.307 --> 31:19.910
Or we both agree
to just be cool about it.

31:27.384 --> 31:29.519
I'll hang out. You got to go
to the gym, right?

31:29.586 --> 31:32.923
-Not after this little talk.
-Okay, let's flip a coin for it.

31:32.990 --> 31:34.025
No way.

31:34.090 --> 31:37.494
Then what do you suggest?

31:37.561 --> 31:40.363
Well, tonight's gonna be
our first double date, I guess.

31:40.431 --> 31:42.199
Which is weird.

31:42.266 --> 31:45.002
I mean, on top of
the already weird situation.

31:45.068 --> 31:46.936
Now that I told you
about your arrangement,

31:47.003 --> 31:49.740
are you, like, disgusted
with me and Ford?

31:49.807 --> 31:51.741
Oh, no, not additionally
disgusted.

31:51.808 --> 31:53.510
Just the same as before.

31:53.576 --> 31:55.546
But, like, in a good way.

31:55.613 --> 31:58.749
No. You realize when one of you
has sex with her,

31:58.816 --> 31:59.850
things are going
to implode, right?

31:59.916 --> 32:01.651
Oh, come on.

32:01.719 --> 32:05.523
I mean, we have our own, like, styles
and vibes and stuff. We're good.

32:05.588 --> 32:07.724
None of those things,
like, help the situation.

32:07.791 --> 32:09.626
But whatever you say.
You do you.

32:09.692 --> 32:11.295
Just call me right after.

32:11.362 --> 32:14.331
Not right after.
Maybe the next day.

32:14.397 --> 32:17.767
Whenever you feel comfortable
and are fully clothed,

32:17.835 --> 32:18.903
give me a buzz.

32:18.970 --> 32:21.572
Okay.

32:21.638 --> 32:22.606
Thanks for listening.

32:22.673 --> 32:24.075
I figure Ford's, you know,

32:24.142 --> 32:25.509
just proclaiming it
to the office,

32:25.576 --> 32:28.010
so, you know, I thought
it might be a good idea

32:28.077 --> 32:29.346
to get a female opinion.

32:29.413 --> 32:30.815
Yup, that's me.

32:30.881 --> 32:33.017
All female, all opinions.

32:35.818 --> 32:36.921
Welcome to the mill.

32:36.988 --> 32:38.522
All right, right there.
Come here.

32:38.588 --> 32:41.791
I want to show you, like,
my favorite thing in the world.

32:41.858 --> 32:43.293
This is Big Buck Hunter.

32:43.361 --> 32:45.329
I have the high score
right here, as you can see.

32:45.395 --> 32:47.565
My hunting persona
is One Shot.

32:47.631 --> 32:49.367
-You?
-One Shot, baby.

32:49.432 --> 32:51.301
Oh!

32:51.368 --> 32:53.069
All right.

32:53.135 --> 32:55.205
Look, the objective is to actually
kill the animal, so no playing nice,

32:55.206 --> 32:56.206
okay?

32:56.272 --> 32:58.541
-You know how to use this?
-I got it. Yes, I got it.

32:58.608 --> 33:00.042
-This is how you-
-I know how to hold a gun.

33:00.109 --> 33:01.144
-All right, reload.
-Down.

33:01.211 --> 33:03.514
Down. Ready?

33:03.580 --> 33:05.048
All right, I'm gonna
take it easy on you.

33:05.115 --> 33:06.683
No, don't take it easy
on me.

33:06.750 --> 33:07.751
Ready?

33:07.817 --> 33:09.019
Go.

33:11.122 --> 33:12.190
I got that one.

33:12.256 --> 33:13.990
Oh!

33:14.057 --> 33:15.826
-How are you...
-Is this working?

33:15.893 --> 33:18.694
Yo, just be quiet.
Quiet.

33:18.761 --> 33:20.730
Nothing from the peanut gallery.
What are you doing?

33:20.798 --> 33:22.333
How are you doing good at this?

33:22.398 --> 33:24.801
Stop, you're not supposed to
actually be good at this.

33:24.867 --> 33:26.537
I'm actually
really good at this.

33:26.604 --> 33:28.771
Careful.
Stop.

33:28.838 --> 33:31.008
Whoa.

33:31.075 --> 33:32.477
-What?
-I got one.

33:32.542 --> 33:34.577
-Holy shit.
-Oh, wait, no, two!

33:34.644 --> 33:35.846
My gun's broken.

33:35.913 --> 33:37.447
I'm about to beat
your high score.

33:37.513 --> 33:39.348
No, my gun's not working.
No, you're not.

33:39.415 --> 33:40.717
Oh! Oh!

33:40.785 --> 33:42.653
Holy shit.

33:42.720 --> 33:44.688
You got the Critter Bonus
and everything.

33:44.755 --> 33:46.890
Bummer, dude.
Sorry.

33:46.957 --> 33:48.426
Hey, you,
you're a wonderful artist.

33:48.491 --> 33:50.327
I love your work,
beating Ford at his own game.

33:50.394 --> 33:53.029
It was gonna be
embarrassing for him.

33:53.096 --> 33:55.833
You are, like,
made of magic.

33:55.898 --> 33:57.733
You... you're magical.

33:57.800 --> 34:00.604
God, I just...
I love you.

34:00.671 --> 34:02.105
What?

34:03.973 --> 34:05.108
What?

34:05.175 --> 34:09.146
I... I said I...
love you?

34:09.780 --> 34:12.917
I love you too.

34:12.983 --> 34:14.885
I mean... I mean,
we love you.

34:14.952 --> 34:16.987
Yeah, that's what
I, I mean, we...

34:17.054 --> 34:18.789
we love you.

34:18.855 --> 34:20.690
I love you guys too.

34:20.757 --> 34:21.791
You know what?

34:21.858 --> 34:24.193
This is actually
pretty nice.

34:24.260 --> 34:26.029
Yeah, it's working out.

34:26.097 --> 34:27.697
Yeah.

34:27.764 --> 34:30.266
Oh, it was a long night.
I'm gonna go home.

34:30.333 --> 34:32.735
Ford, you're on the way.
Do you want me to drop you off?

34:32.802 --> 34:34.704
Uh, yeah.
Sure.

34:34.771 --> 34:35.905
I'll see you tomorrow?

34:35.972 --> 34:38.275
Yeah.

34:46.516 --> 34:48.685
Okay.

34:48.753 --> 34:50.286
This has a lot of potential
right here.

34:50.353 --> 34:51.621
Yeah?
This is quite good.

34:51.688 --> 34:54.223
It titillates
without being too insipid.

34:54.291 --> 34:55.426
-It's really-
-Oh, hey, here we go.

34:55.492 --> 34:56.659
So all right.
Check it out.

34:56.726 --> 34:58.495
Here are the Converse.

34:58.563 --> 35:00.230
These are fresh!

35:00.297 --> 35:01.597
-Funky fresh.
-We'll focus-test it.

35:01.664 --> 35:04.902
So how's your
collective girl doing?

35:04.969 --> 35:06.637
I still can't believe

35:06.704 --> 35:08.539
that Ford told you guys
about that.

35:08.605 --> 35:09.639
I trust them.

35:09.706 --> 35:12.009
Noah, your secret
is safe with us.

35:12.076 --> 35:13.277
Okay?

35:13.342 --> 35:15.311
I have much darker
and dirtier secrets

35:15.378 --> 35:17.581
I've never, never revealed.

35:17.648 --> 35:19.383
Much darker.

35:19.449 --> 35:21.417
I'm curious
about the sex schedule.

35:21.485 --> 35:24.021
Are the three of you exclusive
to one another?

35:24.088 --> 35:27.391
Have you even floated the
threesome question yet? I would.

35:27.458 --> 35:29.259
No, we've been
taking it pretty slow,

35:29.326 --> 35:30.760
you know, so no sex yet.

35:33.130 --> 35:34.530
Actually...

35:34.597 --> 35:36.467
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:36.532 --> 35:39.269
You're... last night?
When she was just driving you home?

35:39.336 --> 35:41.471
Look, it had to be
one of us.

35:43.172 --> 35:44.908
<i>Ford to reception, please.</i>

35:44.976 --> 35:46.210
I'm sorry.

35:48.110 --> 35:51.013
Round one goes to Ford.

35:54.050 --> 35:57.288
Um, okay, guys,
I need your help.

35:57.355 --> 35:58.889
You want to stick it
in your girl.

35:58.956 --> 36:00.157
Sure, okay.

36:00.224 --> 36:03.227
Yes, yes, that is
what I want to do,

36:03.293 --> 36:04.327
the thing you said.

36:04.394 --> 36:06.597
Noah, I love you,

36:06.663 --> 36:08.699
but you're too sweet
for your own good.

36:08.766 --> 36:11.601
You need to add some danger
to the dynamic.

36:11.668 --> 36:14.204
-Women love danger.
-They do.

36:14.271 --> 36:16.639
Yeah, but, see, I'm not really
the dangerous type.

36:16.706 --> 36:19.675
You know what I mean? That's kind
of... I wouldn't know how to do that.

36:19.742 --> 36:21.344
I'm not telling you
to stab anyone.

36:21.411 --> 36:22.746
I'm telling you
to invite her over

36:22.813 --> 36:25.682
and put on
a sexy Liam Neeson thriller.

36:25.750 --> 36:28.284
Stabbing could be fun
if it's with your flesh rod.

36:28.351 --> 36:32.056
If you ask me, what I see here

36:32.123 --> 36:34.825
is you and Ford,
and over here is Callie.

36:34.891 --> 36:36.326
And who's this?

36:36.393 --> 36:40.498
This is Noah
up on his sexual steed,

36:40.563 --> 36:43.299
this erotic little animal.

36:43.365 --> 36:44.802
And he's running through
the pastures.

36:46.637 --> 36:50.207
To get to the Callie,
you're gonna have to gallop.

36:50.273 --> 36:53.076
And then you're gonna have
to whisk her away.

36:53.143 --> 36:55.378
Whisk her away through the...

36:56.179 --> 36:57.681
Over there in your bed.

36:57.748 --> 36:59.416
That's when
you will transform yourself

36:59.483 --> 37:01.385
into the sexual Noah.

37:01.451 --> 37:03.253
When you do,
I want to meet him.

37:03.320 --> 37:04.956
Me too.

37:06.623 --> 37:08.291
They told me to be, like,
Sexual Noah.

37:08.358 --> 37:10.260
Sexual Noah?
What does that even mean?

37:10.327 --> 37:11.295
I don't know.

37:11.362 --> 37:12.563
Wait, well,

37:12.630 --> 37:14.398
you shouldn't be
listening to these guys.

37:14.465 --> 37:16.633
I mean, they don't even know
what they're talking about.

37:16.699 --> 37:17.399
Sexual Noah?

37:17.467 --> 37:20.237
That... that sounds gross.

37:20.304 --> 37:21.338
What?

37:21.405 --> 37:22.473
I just envisioned it.

37:22.539 --> 37:23.773
I don't know.
It just seems weird.

37:23.840 --> 37:25.608
Be yourself.
She'll be comfortable.

37:25.675 --> 37:28.244
She'll pick up on it. And you guys
will have a really good time.

37:28.311 --> 37:31.181
Yeah, see, but I don't even know
what to, like, do with her.

37:31.248 --> 37:32.950
She's not an infant.
Take her on a date.

37:33.016 --> 37:34.184
Yeah, we've been on dates.

37:34.251 --> 37:35.853
I'm saying, like,
I don't know...

37:35.920 --> 37:38.289
Like, what's an ideal date?
What's a good perfect date?

37:38.356 --> 37:40.991
I think an ideal date
is just taking a nice walk.

37:41.057 --> 37:42.626
A walk?

37:42.693 --> 37:44.761
Yeah, show up with,
like, a cute little gift

37:44.827 --> 37:47.864
or strawberry ice cream.
That'd be awesome.

37:47.931 --> 37:50.601
Okay, but, see, no, 'cause
she doesn't even like ice cream.

37:50.668 --> 37:52.169
-What?
-No, it's a thing.

37:52.235 --> 37:53.737
That's weird.
You realize that, right?

37:53.804 --> 37:56.173
I know, but she's one in a million.
What are you gonna do?

37:56.239 --> 37:59.709
Just be yourself and stop trying
to be someone you're not.

37:59.777 --> 38:01.445
You want her to like you
for you, don't you?

38:01.512 --> 38:02.946
Yeah, okay.
No, you're right.

38:03.012 --> 38:06.081
That's... yeah, that's probably
pretty good advice.

38:06.148 --> 38:07.518
It was?

38:07.585 --> 38:09.019
I mean, honestly,
the whole time,

38:09.085 --> 38:10.820
I was blacked out
and just thinking about food,

38:10.887 --> 38:14.690
and I really don't think
I hit the surface of the analogy.

38:14.757 --> 38:16.659
-Oh.
-I should stop while I'm ahead.

38:16.726 --> 38:18.127
You like it?
We're good.

38:18.195 --> 38:19.963
Can we eat now?

38:20.030 --> 38:21.632
I'm good.
Thank you.

38:23.900 --> 38:25.369
Bye.

38:25.434 --> 38:27.336
Cute kitchen, Noah.

38:27.403 --> 38:29.739
So we're watching
a Liam Neeson movie, right?

38:29.806 --> 38:31.741
Uh, yeah.

38:31.809 --> 38:33.410
Or...

38:33.476 --> 38:36.547
You know, all movies
should be filmed

38:36.614 --> 38:37.715
in newspaper offices.

38:37.782 --> 38:39.649
I know. Right?
It's amazing.

38:39.715 --> 38:41.451
<i>When he walks with a lady,
he waits for her.</i>

38:41.518 --> 38:44.688
<i>Oh, well, in that case...</i>

38:47.356 --> 38:49.391
Oh, I wish I worked there.

38:52.896 --> 38:54.998
Wow, that was actually
really good.

38:55.065 --> 38:56.233
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

38:56.300 --> 38:58.369
Thank you.
Hey, I got something for you.

38:58.436 --> 38:59.670
All right.

39:01.838 --> 39:04.040
Okay, it's...

39:04.106 --> 39:07.076
a little something,
uh...

39:07.143 --> 39:08.778
What is it?

39:10.313 --> 39:11.581
Okay.

39:12.215 --> 39:13.449
Oh, my God, Noah.

39:13.516 --> 39:15.385
Did you make this for me?

39:15.452 --> 39:16.720
Yeah, it's my first memory

39:16.786 --> 39:19.122
of seeing you
at that prom thing.

39:20.791 --> 39:22.159
I love it.

39:22.226 --> 39:23.961
Yeah, you like it?

39:24.027 --> 39:26.429
Cool.

39:39.677 --> 39:42.012
Dude, what's going on?

39:42.079 --> 39:43.414
Hmm? What?

39:45.148 --> 39:47.951
Did... did you and Callie...

39:48.018 --> 39:49.952
I slept with her!

39:50.019 --> 39:51.655
I knew it!

39:51.722 --> 39:53.490
It was like
a religious experience.

39:53.556 --> 39:55.457
I'm happy for you.

39:55.525 --> 39:56.860
I think this thing's
gonna work out.

39:56.927 --> 39:58.095
It is.

39:58.161 --> 39:59.194
Did she ask you,
by the way,

39:59.262 --> 40:00.430
to do that photo shoot thing?

40:00.496 --> 40:01.797
Yeah, yeah.

40:01.864 --> 40:03.466
Yeah, do you know
what we're doing?

40:03.534 --> 40:05.035
No, I just said I'll do it.

40:05.101 --> 40:07.270
Yeah, okay, me neither.

40:11.407 --> 40:13.143
Nice ones.
Okay.

40:13.210 --> 40:14.344
Yeah, looks good.

40:14.411 --> 40:16.179
Hey, they're here.

40:16.246 --> 40:17.447
Hey, guys, this is Emery.

40:17.514 --> 40:18.615
He's an amazing
photographer.

40:18.681 --> 40:20.250
He's helping me a lot.

40:20.317 --> 40:21.318
How's it going, Emery?
Ford.

40:21.385 --> 40:22.619
-Nice to meet you.
-Yeah.

40:22.686 --> 40:23.621
Nice to meet you too.

40:23.686 --> 40:25.020
So cool you guys
are up for this.

40:25.088 --> 40:26.323
Yeah.
Oh, of course.

40:26.389 --> 40:28.125
Anything for
this beautiful lady here.

40:28.192 --> 40:29.226
So what are we doing,
exactly?

40:29.291 --> 40:30.960
You guys are gonna be
my models.

40:31.027 --> 40:32.195
Okay.

40:32.262 --> 40:33.497
-We're gonna model?
-Yeah.

40:33.563 --> 40:34.797
-"Naked Friends."
-Cool.

40:34.864 --> 40:35.798
Yeah.

40:35.865 --> 40:38.034
Old friends, young friends,
unfiltered.

40:39.702 --> 40:41.438
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

40:41.505 --> 40:43.773
-In a photo, in...
-Yeah, what's the big deal?

40:43.840 --> 40:45.909
There's the whole posterity thing.
What about my future kids?

40:45.976 --> 40:48.278
I don't know.
I don't want to see them...

40:48.344 --> 40:49.980
I'm sorry.
Who are you again?

40:50.047 --> 40:51.115
-I'm Emery.
-Emery.

40:51.181 --> 40:53.716
It's called "Naked Friends."
I need you both.

40:53.784 --> 40:56.086
Look, I would love
to support you in this.

40:56.152 --> 40:59.922
I want to support you. I just...
I'm not cool with that.

40:59.989 --> 41:02.625
Well, I don't know what to do now.
The project's due.

41:02.693 --> 41:03.827
Look, it's cool.

41:03.893 --> 41:05.361
-I'll do it, all right?
-What?

41:05.429 --> 41:06.863
I feel like
we're friends already.

41:06.929 --> 41:09.265
No, no, no, no, I need you.
I need you to help me shoot.

41:09.331 --> 41:10.833
Look, you know
what you're doing.

41:10.900 --> 41:13.569
Come here.
Good, you're good.

41:13.637 --> 41:15.272
You got this, all right?

41:15.338 --> 41:16.806
-All right.
-Okay?

41:16.873 --> 41:18.509
-Yeah.
-All right, let's do this.

41:18.576 --> 41:20.010
Let's do it.
Let's get naked.

41:20.077 --> 41:23.046
New friends
getting naked together.

41:23.112 --> 41:27.250
<i>¶ I want to get wild
with you ¶</i>

41:27.317 --> 41:28.652
What?

41:30.019 --> 41:32.322
<i>¶ I want to get wild
with you ¶</i>

41:32.389 --> 41:33.691
Perfect.
No, no, no, back to back.

41:36.492 --> 41:38.594
<i>¶ Wild with you ¶</i>

41:38.661 --> 41:41.063
<i>¶ I want to get wild with you ¶</i>

41:41.130 --> 41:43.299
<i>¶ I want to get wild
with you ¶</i>

41:43.367 --> 41:44.300
Nice meeting you.

41:51.608 --> 41:54.144
Hey.
Uh, congratulations.

41:54.210 --> 41:56.579
By the way, the whole thing,
I'm sorry about,

41:56.646 --> 41:57.947
you know, not getting naked.

41:58.014 --> 41:58.949
No, it's okay.

41:59.016 --> 42:02.751
You're you,
and Ford is Ford.

42:02.818 --> 42:05.822
And he gets into things
really hard and really fast.

42:05.889 --> 42:07.557
You're more of a slow burn.

42:07.623 --> 42:09.759
But I know I can count on you.

42:09.826 --> 42:11.427
Yeah.
But, hey, we're still on

42:11.494 --> 42:13.029
for movie night
at my place tonight?

42:13.096 --> 42:15.498
A 1933 Ernst Lubitsch film
called "Design for Living."

42:15.565 --> 42:18.234
It's about two best friends.
I think you'd find it interesting.

42:18.302 --> 42:19.637
It's kind of up your alley.

42:19.702 --> 42:21.804
I have a better idea.
Come into the green room.

42:26.476 --> 42:29.179
I... oh, wow.

42:29.246 --> 42:31.048
Here, take a shot.

42:31.114 --> 42:34.083
Uh, okay.

42:34.150 --> 42:36.219
Hey, man.

42:36.286 --> 42:38.588
What's going on?

42:38.655 --> 42:41.224
Callie had an idea.

42:41.291 --> 42:42.992
Oh, did she?

42:43.059 --> 42:44.794
What do you... what do you...
what's going on?

42:44.860 --> 42:47.864
Well, Ford is basically naked,

42:47.931 --> 42:51.434
and I'm about to be naked.

42:51.501 --> 42:54.038
Oh, are you?

42:56.472 --> 42:57.875
Is...

42:57.940 --> 43:00.743
mm.

43:02.278 --> 43:06.016
Oh, uh, 'kay.
Is...

43:06.083 --> 43:07.684
Yeah, hey,
I'm not kissing you.

43:07.751 --> 43:09.353
I didn't want you to.

43:09.418 --> 43:11.554
So?

43:12.822 --> 43:14.022
We gonna do this?

43:14.090 --> 43:16.092
I guess.

43:16.159 --> 43:19.396
Oh, screw it.
It's been a weird day.

43:20.431 --> 43:21.932
Ah. Whoa!

43:26.302 --> 43:28.505
Well, look what you did!

43:28.572 --> 43:30.307
I got it.

43:30.373 --> 43:33.509
I kind of feel a little weird
about last night.

43:33.577 --> 43:36.913
Hey, yeah.
It was a little intense.

43:36.980 --> 43:40.916
It wasn't... it wasn't quite
what I was expecting, you know?

43:40.983 --> 43:43.487
Yeah, a lot more waiting around
than I was expecting.

43:43.552 --> 43:44.788
Waiting, yeah.

43:44.853 --> 43:47.423
It was just waiting
and then watching

43:47.490 --> 43:48.559
and just got a little weird.

43:48.625 --> 43:51.226
-Yeah.
-Yeah, that's what it was.

43:52.228 --> 43:54.396
I mean, I'm glad
we did it, though.

43:54.463 --> 43:55.666
Really?

43:55.731 --> 43:57.434
Yeah, I mean,
I always wanted to have

43:57.501 --> 43:59.236
a threesome... I think.

43:59.302 --> 44:01.572
I mean, not really with another guy,
but it was... it was different.

44:01.637 --> 44:04.107
It was... yeah.

44:04.173 --> 44:05.742
Probably one-time thing,
though.

44:05.807 --> 44:07.110
You weren't into it?

44:08.945 --> 44:10.347
No, I mean, I was just...

44:10.413 --> 44:12.615
I just wasn't expecting you
to be so... you know.

44:12.682 --> 44:14.351
Good?

44:14.418 --> 44:16.620
Yeah, yeah, like, it was...
you were very good.

44:16.686 --> 44:17.888
She was really into it
with you,

44:17.954 --> 44:20.624
and I was feeling...
not so much.

44:20.690 --> 44:23.559
That's BS.
You looked great naked.

44:23.626 --> 44:28.197
Like... very, very straight.
It was nice.

44:28.264 --> 44:30.766
Oh, that's as far as we have to go
on that front, but thank you.

44:30.833 --> 44:32.435
I appreciate it.

44:32.501 --> 44:36.005
Hey, it's been long enough. What do
you say she meets our friends?

44:36.072 --> 44:37.840
You think
that's a good idea?

44:37.907 --> 44:39.342
Totally. We're having
a company mixer.

44:39.409 --> 44:40.878
Why doesn't she come along?

44:40.943 --> 44:42.378
Dude, she can't come along.
Ed's gonna be there.

44:42.445 --> 44:44.179
Ed can't find out
we're dating the same girl.

44:44.246 --> 44:46.049
Okay, then she comes
as one of our dates.

44:47.451 --> 44:49.519
Whose?

44:49.585 --> 44:52.888
Normally, we play
goodminton.

44:52.956 --> 44:57.561
Today we don't
play goodminton.

44:57.628 --> 44:59.195
We play to win.

44:59.262 --> 45:00.497
We play badminton,

45:00.563 --> 45:02.865
and the winner gets
to take Callie to our dinner.

45:02.932 --> 45:06.302
You're on, Rico Suave.

45:06.369 --> 45:08.438
Idiots.

45:15.813 --> 45:17.180
Oh, there he is
right there.

45:17.246 --> 45:18.580
-Oh.
-Yo, yo.

45:18.648 --> 45:20.682
Uh-oh, there he is.
How's it going?

45:20.750 --> 45:22.318
Ford, thank you so much
for coming.

45:22.385 --> 45:25.255
Thank you for having us. I want you
to meet somebody very special:

45:25.322 --> 45:26.423
my girlfriend, Callie.

45:26.489 --> 45:28.090
-Hi.
-Oh, pleasure to meet you.

45:28.157 --> 45:29.625
Ford, good work
nabbing this beautiful woman.

45:29.693 --> 45:30.794
Oh, I know.

45:30.860 --> 45:31.760
She keeps me young.

45:31.827 --> 45:33.163
So where the drinks at?

45:33.228 --> 45:34.897
-Oh, drinks are in the back.
-Perfect.

45:34.963 --> 45:36.365
-Go at it.
-All right, man. Take care.

45:42.271 --> 45:43.539
Ambien?

45:43.606 --> 45:45.608
Oh, no, thanks.

45:45.675 --> 45:47.911
Isn't it, like,
2:00 in the afternoon?

45:49.213 --> 45:52.816
Sleep medication promotes
especially vivid dreams.

45:54.684 --> 45:58.155
And as you know, I can
control myself in those dreams,

45:58.221 --> 46:03.360
mentally stimulating myself
to the point of orgasm, really.

46:03.425 --> 46:05.460
Yeah, right.
Of course.

46:05.527 --> 46:07.230
It's like Pablo Picasso said:

46:07.297 --> 46:09.365
"Anything that you
can imagine is real."

46:09.431 --> 46:12.735
So anything I imagine sexually,
it will happen,

46:12.802 --> 46:16.071
no matter how sensual,
how deviant,

46:16.139 --> 46:19.242
or how fantastic it might be.

46:19.309 --> 46:21.711
Excellent.

46:21.777 --> 46:23.746
Yesterday I was banging...

46:23.813 --> 46:26.115
Nope.

46:27.016 --> 46:28.251
So how are things going?

46:28.318 --> 46:29.753
So I'm still working
on my app.

46:29.820 --> 46:30.988
Yeah?
Let me see.

46:34.056 --> 46:35.725
Oh, my.

46:35.793 --> 46:37.894
So this is what I'll
look like when I'm dead?

46:37.960 --> 46:39.628
I think
it's a fair approximation.

46:39.695 --> 46:42.664
Oh, my gosh, that's great. Jess,
you're gonna sell a bunch of those.

46:42.731 --> 46:44.067
Thanks.

46:44.134 --> 46:46.001
The interface
still needs so much work,

46:46.068 --> 46:47.871
which is actually why I thought

46:47.936 --> 46:49.572
maybe I could send you
some stuff

46:49.639 --> 46:52.976
and you can come up with
some ideas, if you have a chance.

46:53.876 --> 46:55.445
Sure, yeah.

46:55.512 --> 46:57.147
Okay.

46:57.213 --> 47:00.315
Can you believe
that's our girlfriend?

47:00.382 --> 47:03.452
It's actually pretty weird
when you say it like that.

47:03.519 --> 47:05.954
What? No. Come on.
Don't be so negative.

47:06.021 --> 47:07.255
Things are going great.

47:07.322 --> 47:09.025
I mean, we say
"we love you" to her.

47:09.092 --> 47:11.360
And how does she take that?

47:11.427 --> 47:14.096
Great. She says,
"I love you guys" back to us.

47:14.164 --> 47:16.900
Like, "I love you each
individually"

47:16.967 --> 47:18.867
or "I love you guys plural"?

47:18.934 --> 47:20.670
Uh, I think it's...

47:20.737 --> 47:22.372
I think she says,
"I love you guys."

47:22.438 --> 47:24.473
I don't know.
I don't remember. Why?

47:24.539 --> 47:26.342
Well, one is something
you say to your boyfriend,

47:26.409 --> 47:28.644
and the other is something
you say to, like, your bros

47:28.711 --> 47:30.313
in a beer commercial
or something.

47:30.380 --> 47:32.916
Okay.

47:32.983 --> 47:34.384
I think she meant it.

47:36.018 --> 47:38.187
We're gonna keep
saying it, okay?

47:38.255 --> 47:40.457
Whatever.

47:44.393 --> 47:46.328
Look, I didn't want to be
the one to say this,

47:46.396 --> 47:49.966
but you realize this shit's
getting really weird, right?

47:50.032 --> 47:52.202
What? Since when
have you thought that?

47:52.268 --> 47:53.670
I've always thought that.

47:53.737 --> 47:55.072
But you supported me.

47:55.137 --> 47:56.905
You were the one who had
all the good date ideas

47:56.972 --> 47:58.942
and, you know, the ideas
for things to do

47:59.007 --> 48:00.876
and what's gonna make
this thing work.

48:00.943 --> 48:03.612
I just... I guess I didn't think
you would take it this far.

48:03.679 --> 48:05.049
I thought you'd
realize pretty quickly

48:05.050 --> 48:07.050
that this is a bad arrangement.

48:07.115 --> 48:09.818
It's not a bad arrangement.
It's real.

48:09.885 --> 48:12.521
If this is real, if you have real
feelings for someone,

48:12.588 --> 48:15.090
I just... I don't understand
how you can be okay

48:15.157 --> 48:17.626
with them not being
completely into you too.

48:17.693 --> 48:19.561
Wha...

48:19.628 --> 48:22.230
Look, I'm happy, okay?

48:22.297 --> 48:23.465
Come on.

48:23.532 --> 48:25.268
You don't look very happy
standing up here,

48:25.335 --> 48:26.802
pretending not to be
her boyfriend.

48:26.869 --> 48:29.438
I am. I'm...

48:31.875 --> 48:33.675
Okay, look, yeah, okay?

48:33.742 --> 48:37.112
I do. I want... I want her to like me
the way she likes Ford.

48:37.179 --> 48:38.847
Okay, great.
Go down there.

48:38.914 --> 48:40.349
Go get her.
Win her back.

48:40.416 --> 48:42.786
I don't know what you want me
to say anymore, Noah.

48:42.853 --> 48:44.119
Look, I'm try...
I'm trying.

48:44.186 --> 48:46.221
They're always doing
something dumb and fun together,

48:46.289 --> 48:47.991
and I don't know
how to compete with that.

48:48.057 --> 48:49.391
Okay, be dumber and funner.

48:49.458 --> 48:50.793
Yeah, that...
that's probably...

48:50.860 --> 48:52.261
that's actually
what I should do.

48:52.327 --> 48:53.663
No, I was being sarcastic.

48:53.730 --> 48:56.199
No, I mean, that's the only move
I have left.

48:56.266 --> 48:58.402
The me thing,
that's not working.

48:58.467 --> 49:00.402
What I need to do
is be not me,

49:00.469 --> 49:03.639
be something other than me,
be better than me.

49:03.706 --> 49:05.675
Noah?

49:05.742 --> 49:07.911
You're great.

49:07.976 --> 49:10.045
If you don't realize that,

49:10.112 --> 49:12.281
you're even dumber
than I thought.

49:15.385 --> 49:16.486
Great.

49:17.621 --> 49:19.856
This is perfect.

49:19.922 --> 49:21.290
Thanks for coming.

49:25.527 --> 49:27.495
-Hey.
-Noah, what are you doing here?

49:27.563 --> 49:29.733
Let's go on a trip right now,
you and me.

49:29.800 --> 49:31.234
What about Ford?

49:31.300 --> 49:32.802
No, he can't make it.
Just you and me.

49:32.869 --> 49:34.336
He's busy.
Got work stuff, you know.

49:34.403 --> 49:36.139
Busy guy.
He does things.

49:36.206 --> 49:39.642
Okay, all right.
Where are we going?

49:41.110 --> 49:43.413
I just love alligators.

49:43.478 --> 49:45.081
There are no alligators
in Minnesota.

49:45.148 --> 49:46.216
No... Minnesota?

49:46.282 --> 49:47.517
Venezuela, not Minnesota.

49:47.583 --> 49:48.952
Venezuela.
I see.

49:49.018 --> 49:50.252
Okay, well, hang on.
You wait here.

49:50.320 --> 49:51.821
I'm gonna go survey
for alligators,

49:51.887 --> 49:53.355
and I'll be right back.

49:53.422 --> 49:55.323
-Wait, I should...
-No, no, just you wait here.

49:55.391 --> 49:56.925
I'm gonna make sure
it's safe.

49:56.992 --> 49:59.061
-I will call you in a second.
-All right.

50:09.438 --> 50:11.007
Hey. Now.

50:11.074 --> 50:13.510
-Yeah?
-Come here.

50:13.576 --> 50:15.211
This is gorgeous.
Here, come on over.

50:15.277 --> 50:17.346
I'll show you
when you get here.

50:18.248 --> 50:19.414
Callie, Callie.

50:19.481 --> 50:21.817
Come here. Come here.
Come on up.

50:21.885 --> 50:23.886
Ta-da!

50:23.952 --> 50:26.121
Oh, my God!
Are you crazy?

50:26.188 --> 50:27.190
Let's do it right here.

50:27.257 --> 50:29.125
-No!
-Come on.

50:29.192 --> 50:31.027
-I am crazy.
-Shh.

50:31.092 --> 50:32.328
I am out of my mind!

50:32.394 --> 50:33.295
-Oh, my God.
-Come on!

50:33.362 --> 50:34.663
You have no clothes on!

50:34.731 --> 50:35.765
-Come on.
-No.

50:35.831 --> 50:37.065
-Come on.
-No, no, no, stop.

50:37.132 --> 50:38.234
-Callie.
-We can't do it here.

50:38.300 --> 50:40.103
-Callie, come on.
-No, no, stop.

50:40.170 --> 50:41.805
Come on.

50:41.871 --> 50:42.871
No, no, no, no.

50:42.938 --> 50:44.240
There's no... it's not-

50:44.306 --> 50:45.607
no, she's... she's my-

50:45.675 --> 50:47.543
You stay away from me, okay?
I have mace.

50:47.610 --> 50:49.144
Please, no, stop.

50:49.211 --> 50:50.480
There's no need to whi...
there's no...

50:50.545 --> 50:51.947
I can... I can explain.
There's...

50:52.014 --> 50:53.182
I can explain.

50:54.317 --> 50:55.418
I need you to bail me out.

50:55.483 --> 50:56.952
I don't have any money.

50:57.019 --> 50:58.119
What?

50:58.186 --> 50:59.621
Oh, you know what?
We can call Ford.

50:59.688 --> 51:00.656
No, no, no, we can't.

51:00.724 --> 51:02.825
He's... he's busy.

51:02.891 --> 51:05.460
-Emery.
-Um...

51:05.527 --> 51:07.830
Do you have a problem
with Emery?

51:07.896 --> 51:09.965
Did you and Emery ever...

51:10.032 --> 51:11.668
Why does that matter?

51:11.733 --> 51:14.170
I don't know,
because he's, you know,

51:14.235 --> 51:15.771
super handsome and amazing

51:15.838 --> 51:18.841
and a super-cool guy who's rich
and has amazing pubes.

51:18.907 --> 51:20.342
-Pubes?
-Yeah.

51:20.409 --> 51:23.078
What?
I looked at his pubes, okay?

51:23.146 --> 51:25.748
Okay. Okay, you know what?
Forget about it.

51:25.815 --> 51:26.882
Let's just call Ford.

51:28.317 --> 51:29.385
Yeah, you're right.

51:29.452 --> 51:32.355
He's probably not
that busy.

51:32.422 --> 51:35.992
Noah, did you make that up,
that he's busy?

51:36.059 --> 51:37.527
No, no, I... he's...

51:37.594 --> 51:39.396
I'm just saying
he's probably not, you know,

51:39.461 --> 51:41.697
as busy as, like,
another busy person

51:41.764 --> 51:44.201
who's often busy might be.

51:45.568 --> 51:47.769
Noah, are you still okay
with us all dating?

51:47.836 --> 51:50.474
Yeah. I'm super cool.

51:51.407 --> 51:53.275
Doesn't seem like it.

52:00.083 --> 52:01.351
I'm cool.

52:06.655 --> 52:08.958
I can't believe you lied
to her about me.

52:09.025 --> 52:11.227
I'm sorry.
I needed alone time.

52:11.293 --> 52:13.028
We had alone time.

52:13.096 --> 52:14.364
We had schedules.

52:14.429 --> 52:16.098
We're partners, remember?

52:16.166 --> 52:17.801
Right, great partners.

52:17.867 --> 52:20.436
She hasn't even answered
my last couple of calls.

52:20.503 --> 52:21.903
She's holding you
against me.

52:23.105 --> 52:24.539
She liked us, Noah.

52:24.606 --> 52:28.076
It was working.
What more did you need?

52:28.143 --> 52:30.178
-I...
-Oh, and when is the last time

52:30.246 --> 52:32.347
me and you hung out...
just us, messing around?

52:32.414 --> 52:35.351
We don't even do that
without her around anymore.

52:38.186 --> 52:39.855
Look, Ed's wedding's tomorrow,

52:39.922 --> 52:42.291
and if she doesn't show up,
I don't have a date.

52:42.358 --> 52:43.894
And that'll be your fault.

52:46.362 --> 52:48.565
You know, I think the reason
we're having problems

52:48.632 --> 52:50.032
with this whole Callie situation

52:50.099 --> 52:51.300
is because you're
jealous of me.

52:51.367 --> 52:52.936
Why would I
be jealous of you?

52:53.001 --> 52:55.270
Maybe because me and Callie
get along great together.

52:55.338 --> 52:57.206
You know, we have fun.
I'm able to make her laugh.

52:57.273 --> 52:58.541
She needs excitement,

52:58.608 --> 53:00.276
not somebody who can
barely even trust her.

53:00.342 --> 53:01.810
No, what she needs is someone
who can keep

53:01.878 --> 53:03.646
a relationship going
longer than two weeks

53:03.713 --> 53:06.282
and who can talk to her about things
other than Big Buck Hunter.

53:06.349 --> 53:07.684
I talk to her way more
than just Big Buck...

53:07.751 --> 53:08.718
Hey, guys.

53:08.784 --> 53:10.019
Oh, uh, hi.

53:10.085 --> 53:12.087
You look... wow.

53:12.155 --> 53:13.456
I wasn't sure
if you were coming.

53:13.523 --> 53:15.125
I wasn't sure either.

53:15.190 --> 53:16.826
Well, you look beautiful.

53:18.695 --> 53:19.930
I said that.

53:21.931 --> 53:24.099
Talk to me, Noah.

53:24.166 --> 53:27.202
You said you liked living with that
guy and girl in Stuttgart, right?

53:28.436 --> 53:31.373
So did anyone ever
have problems?

53:31.440 --> 53:34.143
Like, did anyone ever get
jealous or anything like that?

53:34.210 --> 53:36.879
It actually ended
in an interesting fashion.

53:36.947 --> 53:38.481
Inga shot Marcus
in the knee

53:38.547 --> 53:41.016
with a Heckler & Koch
9-millimeter.

53:41.083 --> 53:42.585
It was a fricking bloodbath.

53:42.652 --> 53:44.186
I thought you said
it was fun.

53:44.253 --> 53:45.555
By the end of the night,

53:45.621 --> 53:47.123
we were all dancing
in the blood,

53:47.190 --> 53:49.358
so on the whole,
I would still have to say

53:49.425 --> 53:52.062
it was a positive experience.

53:52.128 --> 53:54.797
Hey, you're handsome,
and you know it.

53:54.864 --> 53:56.699
Clap your hands.

54:05.440 --> 54:07.610
<i>¶ I may have two left feet ¶</i>

54:07.677 --> 54:10.579
<i>¶ But I can still feel
the beat ¶</i>

54:10.646 --> 54:13.650
<i>¶ And I keep dancing
all night long ¶</i>

54:13.717 --> 54:15.718
I'll take three.

54:15.784 --> 54:17.385
Thanks.

54:17.452 --> 54:20.590
<i>¶How can I complain when... ¶</i>

54:20.655 --> 54:22.824
Yeah, I'll take that.
Thank you.

54:22.891 --> 54:27.263
<i>¶ So I'll be dancing
all night long ¶</i>

54:28.396 --> 54:30.000
<i>¶ Yeah, I'll be... ¶</i>

54:30.065 --> 54:31.766
Want to dance?

54:31.833 --> 54:33.469
Sure.

54:36.105 --> 54:39.675
<i>¶ I've got a smile
for everyone I see ¶</i>

54:39.742 --> 54:41.643
<i>¶ For everyone I see ¶</i>

54:41.710 --> 54:42.877
Milady.

54:44.112 --> 54:45.647
<i>¶ Is playing just for me ¶</i>

54:45.715 --> 54:47.483
You guys look cute together...

54:47.550 --> 54:49.018
Ford and his girl,
you and Jess.

54:49.085 --> 54:50.385
I'm glad you all came.

54:50.452 --> 54:52.922
You... congratulations!
Ed, you did it!

54:52.989 --> 54:54.356
You got married today!

54:54.422 --> 54:56.358
You... you're the man, Ed.

54:56.425 --> 54:58.561
Oh, man, Ed's gonna
have sex tonight!

54:58.626 --> 54:59.628
Shh.

54:59.695 --> 55:02.030
I don't...
he never did it before.

55:03.465 --> 55:05.567
-You're so loud.
-It's gonna happen.

55:05.635 --> 55:07.937
I wish I could be there.

55:08.003 --> 55:09.572
No, you don't.

55:09.637 --> 55:15.411
<i>¶ Yeah, I'll be dancing
all night ¶</i>

55:15.478 --> 55:20.316
<i>¶ Take my hand, darling ¶</i>

55:20.382 --> 55:21.683
Oh, my God, hi.

55:21.751 --> 55:23.052
Hey, guys.

55:23.119 --> 55:24.519
You look happy.

55:24.586 --> 55:25.655
We're getting married.

55:25.721 --> 55:27.289
You're... you're...
con...

55:27.356 --> 55:29.558
you guys, congratulations!

55:29.625 --> 55:31.760
I love this man so much.

55:31.827 --> 55:34.362
Wait.

55:34.429 --> 55:36.632
What about the whole
"it's so awesome we're gay

55:36.699 --> 55:38.201
"'cause we can sleep around

55:38.266 --> 55:40.435
and still be
in a relationship" thing?

55:40.503 --> 55:42.638
Oh, we're cutting back
on that; honestly,

55:42.704 --> 55:44.840
it was getting to be a bit
too much work emotionally.

55:44.907 --> 55:46.008
And...

55:46.074 --> 55:47.876
we're still open to inviting

55:47.943 --> 55:50.012
the occasional fellow
into our bed

55:50.079 --> 55:52.381
every now and then... you know,
for a special occasion...

55:52.447 --> 55:54.183
a birthday, Easter...

55:54.250 --> 55:55.451
Well, I'm just happy

55:55.518 --> 55:57.954
everyone's having
such a good time.

55:59.389 --> 56:00.689
Excuse us.

56:00.755 --> 56:02.125
Hello?
Is this thing on?

56:02.190 --> 56:03.525
Bye.

56:03.592 --> 56:05.260
Hey, can I have
your attention, please?

56:05.327 --> 56:06.496
I'd like to make a toast

56:06.561 --> 56:09.130
to our newlyweds,
Ed and Marta,

56:09.197 --> 56:11.233
proof that America deserves

56:11.300 --> 56:13.702
an interracial
Romeo and Juliet.

56:13.769 --> 56:18.641
Ed, you're not just
a boss to me.

56:18.708 --> 56:20.976
You're a... you are,
but you're a great boss,

56:21.043 --> 56:22.577
a great one.

56:22.644 --> 56:25.280
But more importantly,
when I see you stare at Marta,

56:25.347 --> 56:26.849
I see true love,

56:26.916 --> 56:32.288
something I haven't felt for a very,
very long time until now.

56:32.355 --> 56:34.590
Callie...

56:34.657 --> 56:37.860
Let me tell you guys,
it feels awesome.

56:37.927 --> 56:38.961
<i>L'chaim.</i>

56:40.896 --> 56:42.097
Nope.

56:43.998 --> 56:45.900
-Stop, stop.
-I got a little thing to say.

56:45.967 --> 56:47.068
Hello, everybody.

56:48.536 --> 56:50.205
I also have a toast
I'd like to give.

56:50.273 --> 56:53.041
I just want to say
I love you, Ed.

56:53.108 --> 56:54.110
I love you, Marta.

56:54.177 --> 56:55.510
But most importantly,

56:55.577 --> 56:57.413
I love these two people
right here,

56:57.480 --> 56:59.380
Ford and Callie.

56:59.447 --> 57:01.783
Callie, come on.
Come on up. Come on.

57:01.851 --> 57:04.086
Now, not everyone knows this,

57:04.152 --> 57:08.457
but the three of us are
actually dating each other.

57:08.525 --> 57:12.228
We are all very much
in love with each other,

57:12.295 --> 57:14.530
mutually.

57:14.597 --> 57:15.865
And sexually.

57:15.931 --> 57:17.766
And we shouldn't have to
hide that, you know?

57:17.833 --> 57:21.470
I love you, Ford.
I love you, Callie.

57:21.536 --> 57:24.038
We can make this work.

57:24.106 --> 57:25.975
Jesus, Noah!

57:29.878 --> 57:31.547
All right, put on
the swing music.

57:31.614 --> 57:33.483
Everyone likes swing.
It's coming back.

57:33.548 --> 57:35.918
Dude, what are you doing?

57:35.985 --> 57:36.952
I'm being you.

57:37.019 --> 57:39.655
I'm being fun
and honest and dumb.

57:39.722 --> 57:40.856
Yeah, and telling Ed

57:40.922 --> 57:43.425
the one thing we discussed
not to tell him?

57:43.492 --> 57:44.860
-You're being ridiculous.
-Stop yelling.

57:44.927 --> 57:46.396
I'm not yelling!
You're yelling!

57:46.461 --> 57:47.597
You're both yelling.

57:47.663 --> 57:48.931
Come on.
I'm really disappointed.

57:48.998 --> 57:51.133
Look, if you want
to fire him, I'm sorry,

57:51.199 --> 57:52.567
but I'm not a sexual weirdo.

57:52.635 --> 57:53.970
That's him.
It was his idea.

57:54.036 --> 57:55.671
-Look, look, look...
-That's bullshit!

57:55.737 --> 57:56.940
-Listen...
-I'm sorry, Ed.

57:57.005 --> 57:58.307
I wouldn't fire you

57:58.373 --> 57:59.875
if you would have
told me discreetly.

57:59.942 --> 58:01.744
Plus, this whole
scene tonight? What?

58:01.811 --> 58:03.479
I know you love God
and God is mad at us right now...

58:03.545 --> 58:05.480
Are you firing us?

58:05.547 --> 58:07.515
Look, I like you guys.

58:07.583 --> 58:09.418
I want to give you
two weeks' severance.

58:09.485 --> 58:10.720
You're firing us?

58:10.786 --> 58:12.221
I need to go
make apologies, okay?

58:13.523 --> 58:15.391
A bunch of superfreaks.

58:15.456 --> 58:18.560
I'm not a sexual weirdo,
though.

58:25.534 --> 58:27.403
I'm sorry about that.

58:27.469 --> 58:29.204
You doing okay?
I'm sorry, Mama.

58:29.271 --> 58:32.106
So?

58:36.579 --> 58:38.948
It was fun, right?

58:39.014 --> 58:40.250
Hey, what?

58:40.315 --> 58:41.250
Come on, guys.

58:41.315 --> 58:43.151
-It's over.
-No.

58:43.219 --> 58:44.686
Look, you don't have
to break up with us.

58:44.753 --> 58:46.255
Just... just choose.

58:46.322 --> 58:47.323
I'm not gonna choose.

58:47.389 --> 58:48.557
Right now,
you guys are fighting,

58:48.623 --> 58:49.858
but you'll get over it.

58:49.925 --> 58:52.228
I think I should just
let you guys be together.

58:52.295 --> 58:53.463
-No.
-Oh, come on.

58:53.528 --> 58:54.931
We had an awesome time
together.

58:54.996 --> 58:57.266
Let's just end it right now,
like this.

59:00.369 --> 59:01.336
Sorry.

59:01.403 --> 59:02.739
Wait.

59:03.972 --> 59:05.440
Wait, wait.

59:05.507 --> 59:06.474
No, come on, Callie.

59:06.541 --> 59:07.876
Stop.
I... it's my fault.

59:07.943 --> 59:10.146
I can fix it.

59:14.317 --> 59:15.617
Shit.

59:17.786 --> 59:20.923
Dude, what is wrong
with you? Grow up.

59:20.989 --> 59:22.490
-You're telling me to grow up?
-Yeah.

59:22.557 --> 59:24.226
I don't care
if you read books

59:24.293 --> 59:25.628
or know about art.

59:25.693 --> 59:27.063
You're more of a child
than I am.

59:27.130 --> 59:28.896
You're not even a person.

59:28.963 --> 59:30.567
You're like a stupid
golden retriever

59:30.632 --> 59:33.201
that everyone gives a pass to
because it's a dog

59:33.268 --> 59:34.969
and it's an idiot.

59:35.036 --> 59:36.471
This thing sucks,
by the way.

59:36.538 --> 59:38.074
It makes everything taste
like metal.

59:38.139 --> 59:40.042
Wow.

59:41.577 --> 59:42.745
I liked her...

59:42.811 --> 59:45.414
in the first time
in probably ever.

59:45.481 --> 59:46.915
And you ruined that.

59:46.981 --> 59:48.483
You tried to take her
from me

59:48.550 --> 59:50.885
right here,
right in front of me.

59:50.952 --> 59:53.288
And you would have done that.

59:53.356 --> 59:55.124
Yeah.

59:55.190 --> 59:56.559
I would have.

59:56.626 --> 59:57.727
Yeah.

59:57.793 --> 59:59.862
So in what way
are you my friend?

01:00:14.943 --> 01:00:19.681
<i>¶ Everyone is wrong ¶</i>

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:25.421
<i>¶ And we just won't
be bothered ¶</i>

01:00:25.487 --> 01:00:30.625
<i>¶ As they want us to go along ¶</i>

01:00:30.693 --> 01:00:33.930
<i>¶ But we've ¶</i>

01:00:33.996 --> 01:00:37.966
<i>¶ Got other plans and hopes
inside us ¶</i>

01:00:38.032 --> 01:00:43.938
<i>¶ So we'll keep moving on ¶</i>

01:00:44.005 --> 01:00:49.710
<i>¶ 'Cause there is
no other way ¶</i>

01:00:49.777 --> 01:00:55.717
<i>¶ We just don't belong ¶</i>

01:00:55.784 --> 01:00:58.454
<i>¶ Here where all the words
and thoughts ¶</i>

01:00:58.521 --> 01:01:01.289
<i>¶ Seem to lack color ¶</i>

01:01:03.891 --> 01:01:09.030
<i>¶ We're still young in mind ¶</i>

01:01:09.097 --> 01:01:14.436
<i>¶ We're still young
in mind ¶</i>

01:01:18.139 --> 01:01:20.775
Hey, so thanks
for coming to meet me.

01:01:20.842 --> 01:01:22.076
Yeah, of course.

01:01:22.143 --> 01:01:26.047
I feel pretty stupid
and embarrassed

01:01:26.114 --> 01:01:27.782
about the whole wedding thing.

01:01:27.849 --> 01:01:29.018
Don't worry about it.

01:01:29.085 --> 01:01:31.119
I want to show you something
real quick.

01:01:31.186 --> 01:01:33.122
I, uh...

01:01:33.188 --> 01:01:35.156
did a little artwork
in the back...

01:01:35.224 --> 01:01:36.892
you know the background
of your aging app.

01:01:36.958 --> 01:01:38.826
No way. Thank you.

01:01:38.893 --> 01:01:40.361
Seriously, it looks awesome.

01:01:40.429 --> 01:01:41.497
-Really?
-Yes.

01:01:41.563 --> 01:01:43.464
Cool.

01:01:43.532 --> 01:01:44.800
But here's the thing.

01:01:44.867 --> 01:01:46.402
I'm starting to do
more painting,

01:01:46.469 --> 01:01:47.503
and I need a website,

01:01:47.568 --> 01:01:48.704
and I am no good at that,

01:01:48.771 --> 01:01:49.972
and I was wondering if,
you know,

01:01:50.039 --> 01:01:51.473
you could help me out
a little bit.

01:01:51.539 --> 01:01:52.708
Yeah.

01:01:52.775 --> 01:01:54.376
Of course.
I would love to help you.

01:01:54.443 --> 01:01:56.411
All right. Thank you.

01:01:56.478 --> 01:01:58.514
And I also have been thinking

01:01:58.581 --> 01:02:01.450
that maybe you should just
ask Ed for your job back.

01:02:01.516 --> 01:02:03.518
I mean,
he's a total softy.

01:02:03.585 --> 01:02:04.920
He'll probably
give it to you.

01:02:04.987 --> 01:02:07.556
And we all just
really miss you.

01:02:07.623 --> 01:02:09.258
Maybe. I,

01:02:09.324 --> 01:02:10.592
I don't know.

01:02:10.659 --> 01:02:12.762
I think I might just, like,
try setting out on my own

01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:15.664
and doing my own thing,
'cause, you know, screw bills, right?

01:02:15.731 --> 01:02:16.999
Like, who needs water
and power?

01:02:17.065 --> 01:02:19.234
Yes, electricity
is very overrated.

01:02:20.869 --> 01:02:22.905
I do miss you too.

01:02:27.643 --> 01:02:30.711
Send me a picture.
Come on.

01:02:30.778 --> 01:02:35.485
"I like the new hairdo, Marta.

01:02:37.018 --> 01:02:40.655
Now, what are you wearing?"

01:02:42.190 --> 01:02:44.893
"Well, I'm wearing a suit now,

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:46.994
"but I might not be later.

01:02:47.061 --> 01:02:48.730
"Oh, my goodness, those?

01:02:48.797 --> 01:02:51.632
"Those are my favorite, baby.

01:02:51.699 --> 01:02:53.301
I love those socks.
Ooh."

01:02:54.704 --> 01:02:56.738
Oh. Uh...

01:02:56.804 --> 01:02:58.206
Oh, come in.
Come in.

01:02:58.273 --> 01:02:59.375
Hi, Ford.

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:01.108
Ed.

01:03:02.610 --> 01:03:04.279
Look...

01:03:04.346 --> 01:03:05.648
I wronged you,

01:03:05.713 --> 01:03:08.182
and I'm sorry.

01:03:08.250 --> 01:03:10.786
I'll do anything
to get my job back.

01:03:10.853 --> 01:03:12.355
I'll do weekends.

01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:14.155
And overtime.

01:03:14.222 --> 01:03:16.592
Okay, I'll babysit
for you and Marta.

01:03:16.659 --> 01:03:18.527
-We don't have a kid.
-Yet.

01:03:18.594 --> 01:03:22.597
But the way you guys look at each
other? It's only a matter of time.

01:03:22.664 --> 01:03:24.300
All right,
here's the deal.

01:03:24.365 --> 01:03:26.501
Getting fired,

01:03:26.568 --> 01:03:29.837
it made me realize
that I care about this job,

01:03:29.905 --> 01:03:33.041
probably more than I was
willing to admit.

01:03:33.108 --> 01:03:36.178
And when I put my mind to it,
I'm good at what I do.

01:03:36.244 --> 01:03:38.480
I may not be
a creative genius,

01:03:38.547 --> 01:03:40.550
but I know how to get
people's attention.

01:03:40.615 --> 01:03:42.384
Plus, I'm one of the only
two guys in the world

01:03:42.451 --> 01:03:44.820
who has been practicing
this pitch for weeks.

01:03:44.887 --> 01:03:46.621
What about Noah?

01:03:46.688 --> 01:03:49.892
He doesn't talk to me anymore.

01:03:49.958 --> 01:03:51.961
Okay, so then
if someone clicks here,

01:03:52.027 --> 01:03:53.928
then they can get
a link to your paintings.

01:03:53.996 --> 01:03:56.298
Okay, I got it.

01:03:57.766 --> 01:04:00.402
We're not done.

01:04:00.469 --> 01:04:02.171
Do you want to see some of
the stuff I've been working on?

01:04:02.237 --> 01:04:03.438
Sure.

01:04:12.914 --> 01:04:14.684
So this is
my bad Banksy rip-off

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:17.885
that I made back when
I was young and impressionable.

01:04:17.952 --> 01:04:20.155
So, you know,
like two months ago or so.

01:04:20.222 --> 01:04:22.190
I mean, it's awesome.
Everything's awesome.

01:04:22.257 --> 01:04:24.159
And I'm not
just saying that.

01:04:24.226 --> 01:04:26.994
And I'm not just saying
that I'm not just saying that.

01:04:27.061 --> 01:04:28.829
-Everything I'm saying is...
-So what are you saying?

01:04:28.896 --> 01:04:30.398
You're a great... painter.

01:04:30.465 --> 01:04:32.268
-You're a great painter.
-Thank you.

01:04:32.335 --> 01:04:33.903
No, it's... yeah.

01:04:33.969 --> 01:04:35.937
Thank you.

01:04:39.909 --> 01:04:41.108
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yeah.

01:04:41.175 --> 01:04:42.411
No, no, no, no.

01:04:42.478 --> 01:04:46.682
I must say, I still think
Tight is your masterpiece.

01:04:46.748 --> 01:04:48.683
Yeah.

01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:53.722
Welcome to Buzzed.

01:04:53.789 --> 01:04:55.257
We're thrilled
to have you here today.

01:04:55.324 --> 01:04:57.092
We're really excited
about this campaign.

01:04:57.159 --> 01:04:58.226
You're gonna flip.

01:04:58.293 --> 01:05:00.028
So sit back, get comfortable,

01:05:00.094 --> 01:05:02.063
and Ford here
is gonna take the lead.

01:05:05.199 --> 01:05:07.435
Thanks, Ed.

01:05:09.103 --> 01:05:10.438
You guys know the basic idea:

01:05:10.505 --> 01:05:12.840
a sprawling, city-wide
scavenger hunt

01:05:12.907 --> 01:05:14.710
called the Converse Course.

01:05:14.775 --> 01:05:16.044
But then we thought,

01:05:16.112 --> 01:05:18.012
"What is the basic essence
of this product?"

01:05:18.079 --> 01:05:20.849
Shoes are boring.

01:05:20.916 --> 01:05:23.885
Sneakers are iconic.

01:05:23.952 --> 01:05:25.786
Converse is the new
rebel American icon,

01:05:25.853 --> 01:05:27.321
but it's also more than that.

01:05:27.389 --> 01:05:29.191
It bonds together
this generation

01:05:29.257 --> 01:05:32.961
with its sports, hip-hop,
and punk rock forefathers.

01:05:33.027 --> 01:05:35.262
Youthful idealism and fun.

01:05:36.398 --> 01:05:40.068
It's a brand
grounded in friendship.

01:05:40.135 --> 01:05:42.971
It's a sneaker of your everyday.

01:05:43.038 --> 01:05:45.840
Those multiple meanings...

01:05:45.907 --> 01:05:48.143
are what jump-started me
and my partner

01:05:48.208 --> 01:05:50.145
when we came up with this.

01:05:53.282 --> 01:05:56.451
You guys are staring
at me like...

01:05:56.518 --> 01:05:57.420
okay, um...

01:05:59.987 --> 01:06:01.423
I'll... I'll be right back.

01:06:03.324 --> 01:06:06.727
We had enchiladas
for lunch yesterday, so...

01:06:12.233 --> 01:06:15.036
So scavenger hunts.

01:06:15.103 --> 01:06:18.039
As you may not know,

01:06:18.106 --> 01:06:23.445
scavenger hunts
were invented by...

01:06:23.512 --> 01:06:24.580
Canada.

01:06:27.148 --> 01:06:28.549
What's going on?

01:06:28.617 --> 01:06:30.286
Ed, I don't know.

01:06:30.353 --> 01:06:32.488
I don't know
what got into me. I'm sorry.

01:06:32.554 --> 01:06:35.257
Dude, is everything okay? 'Cause you
are blowing it out there, okay?

01:06:35.324 --> 01:06:36.525
This is serious, Ford.

01:06:36.590 --> 01:06:37.692
Look, I'll be fine.

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:40.395
Just go in there
and buy me some time, please.

01:06:40.461 --> 01:06:42.565
Fine.
Just a couple minutes, okay?

01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:45.000
But in those couple minutes,
whatever you need to do, do it.

01:06:45.067 --> 01:06:47.068
All right, man,
I'm counting on you.

01:06:52.072 --> 01:06:54.275
<i>So what I was trying
to say is,</i>

01:06:54.342 --> 01:06:58.313
Converse is more
than just a name.

01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:01.817
What I was gonna say is
a lot of stuff about i... icon...

01:07:01.882 --> 01:07:02.817
Iconography.

01:07:02.885 --> 01:07:03.919
Iconography.

01:07:03.985 --> 01:07:05.587
But to be honest,
I don't know

01:07:05.653 --> 01:07:07.155
what "iconography" means.

01:07:07.222 --> 01:07:09.325
And that's why I'm here
to handle all that nonsense.

01:07:09.391 --> 01:07:11.159
Great to meet all of you.

01:07:11.226 --> 01:07:12.795
Noah Anders,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:14.363
Sorry I'm late.

01:07:14.429 --> 01:07:17.032
I was just working on a little
last-minute concept art.

01:07:17.099 --> 01:07:18.867
Uh, I think Ford here

01:07:18.934 --> 01:07:22.471
has given you a good introduction
to our theme.

01:07:22.536 --> 01:07:25.006
Now, the central premise
is this.

01:07:25.072 --> 01:07:26.540
The Converse Course
is to be conquered

01:07:26.608 --> 01:07:30.479
not by an individual
but by a team of two.

01:07:30.545 --> 01:07:33.314
Each partner will simultaneously
take a different

01:07:33.382 --> 01:07:35.117
but parallel path
through the city,

01:07:35.182 --> 01:07:36.485
following the clues

01:07:36.550 --> 01:07:38.420
and communicating with
each other along the way.

01:07:38.487 --> 01:07:40.222
And only by combining
those clues

01:07:40.288 --> 01:07:43.224
and working together
can they find the treasure.

01:07:43.291 --> 01:07:45.661
It's a journey that requires
steady communication

01:07:45.728 --> 01:07:48.496
and trust and perseverance.

01:07:48.563 --> 01:07:51.267
The only way to find
the pair of golden Converse

01:07:51.333 --> 01:07:53.735
is to first be
a pair of friends.

01:07:58.706 --> 01:08:00.174
Heavens to Betsy,
that was incredible.

01:08:00.242 --> 01:08:01.477
Oh, thank you, Ed.

01:08:01.543 --> 01:08:02.978
I can't decide
which is more glorious:

01:08:03.043 --> 01:08:04.145
your nuts or your noggin.

01:08:04.213 --> 01:08:06.181
-Oh.
-So are you back for good?

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:09.318
Uh, no, this was just
a one-time thing.

01:08:12.186 --> 01:08:14.155
Thank you for calling me.

01:08:24.131 --> 01:08:25.867
Probably want to thank you.

01:08:27.702 --> 01:08:29.037
Uh, no.

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:30.840
I want to say I'm sorry

01:08:30.904 --> 01:08:33.242
about how I acted
at the wedding

01:08:33.309 --> 01:08:36.042
and what I said.

01:08:36.109 --> 01:08:38.011
You're not
a golden retriever.

01:08:38.078 --> 01:08:40.448
You're a person.

01:08:40.515 --> 01:08:41.617
Thanks.

01:08:43.018 --> 01:08:47.622
I want to say sorry too,
for trying to steal Callie.

01:08:47.689 --> 01:08:50.459
That was probably the
shittiest thing I've ever done.

01:08:53.529 --> 01:08:56.598
Look, we got to find a way
to get past this, okay?

01:08:56.663 --> 01:09:00.202
So I have an idea, which this is
gonna sound a little crazy,

01:09:00.268 --> 01:09:01.970
but just go with me
on this one.

01:09:02.037 --> 01:09:06.240
I think we should punch each other in
the face as many times as possible.

01:09:06.307 --> 01:09:08.877
We just keep going
until someone gives up...

01:09:08.944 --> 01:09:09.877
Are you for real?

01:09:09.944 --> 01:09:11.746
Yeah.

01:09:12.913 --> 01:09:14.015
Okay.

01:09:14.082 --> 01:09:15.349
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

01:09:15.417 --> 01:09:16.785
-Right here?
-Yeah, definitely.

01:09:16.850 --> 01:09:18.519
-Yeah.
-Okay.

01:09:18.587 --> 01:09:19.354
Okay.

01:09:19.421 --> 01:09:20.921
Whew.

01:09:20.988 --> 01:09:22.423
-You sure?
-Yeah, let's go.

01:09:22.490 --> 01:09:24.326
Like, you know,
just like a boom.

01:09:24.393 --> 01:09:25.658
-Yeah.
-Okay.

01:09:25.725 --> 01:09:26.929
I... okay.

01:09:26.993 --> 01:09:28.630
Don't want to break those.

01:09:28.697 --> 01:09:30.331
Yeah, okay.

01:09:30.398 --> 01:09:32.033
Um, good.
On three?

01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:33.001
On three.

01:09:33.068 --> 01:09:34.269
-So ready?
-Yeah.

01:09:34.336 --> 01:09:35.537
-Good?
-Mm-hmm.

01:09:35.604 --> 01:09:36.971
Okay, um...

01:09:37.037 --> 01:09:38.171
Yeah, okay.

01:09:38.238 --> 01:09:41.176
One, two, three.

01:09:43.578 --> 01:09:45.246
Okay, look, see,
we closed our eyes.

01:09:45.313 --> 01:09:46.680
-False start.
-Yeah.

01:09:46.747 --> 01:09:47.983
So we'll do it again.

01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:49.216
-Eyes open.
-Eyes open.

01:09:49.283 --> 01:09:50.350
-On three.
-In the face.

01:09:50.417 --> 01:09:53.255
Yup.
And one, two...

01:09:53.322 --> 01:09:54.390
-Ooh!
-Shit!

01:09:54.456 --> 01:09:55.757
-Ah!
-You hit me!

01:09:55.823 --> 01:09:57.192
Ah, that hurts.

01:09:57.257 --> 01:09:59.260
I don't know
how boxers do this!

01:10:04.667 --> 01:10:07.803
You should have her.

01:10:09.537 --> 01:10:10.571
What?

01:10:10.639 --> 01:10:13.240
Yeah, I don't think
I ever really loved her.

01:10:13.307 --> 01:10:16.677
I think I just...
I loved the idea of her.

01:10:16.744 --> 01:10:19.646
If she's your one,
you should go for it.

01:10:20.716 --> 01:10:22.984
I don't think
she was my one.

01:10:23.051 --> 01:10:24.052
Really?

01:10:24.118 --> 01:10:25.519
Yeah.

01:10:25.587 --> 01:10:29.191
I mean, I want to be
somebody's priority.

01:10:29.257 --> 01:10:30.858
You know?

01:10:30.926 --> 01:10:34.396
I want someone who's
gonna listen and care,

01:10:34.462 --> 01:10:40.234
someone who's gonna be
100% completely into me.

01:10:40.301 --> 01:10:42.136
And only me.

01:10:42.203 --> 01:10:43.304
No offense.

01:10:43.372 --> 01:10:44.840
No, none taken.

01:10:46.774 --> 01:10:49.043
She's probably
with Emery now.

01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:50.377
-Yeah, you think?
-Yeah.

01:10:50.444 --> 01:10:52.880
-That guy looked good.
-Yeah, he did.

01:10:52.948 --> 01:10:55.317
But we're done with
the punching, right?

01:10:55.384 --> 01:10:57.619
-Yeah.
-Cool.

01:11:10.998 --> 01:11:12.533

01:12:17.332 --> 01:12:19.401
<i>¶ Oh, whoa-oh-oh ¶</i>

01:12:19.467 --> 01:12:21.702
<i>¶ Oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh ¶</i>

01:12:21.770 --> 01:12:25.441
<i>"This is where we danced
for the first time."</i>

01:12:34.483 --> 01:12:38.854
<i>¶ Wish that I had stayed ¶</i>

01:12:40.287 --> 01:12:42.156
<i>¶ What if we lose? ¶</i>

01:12:42.224 --> 01:12:44.693
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:12:44.759 --> 01:12:46.994
It was strawberry, right?

01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:48.697
For the dream date?

01:12:50.932 --> 01:12:52.033
Took you long enough.

01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:56.170
<i>¶ I want to feel closer ¶</i>

01:12:56.238 --> 01:13:00.142
<i>¶ I want to be closer ¶</i>

01:13:00.208 --> 01:13:03.744
<i>¶ I want to feel closer ¶</i>

01:13:03.811 --> 01:13:07.649
<i>¶ Closer to you ¶</i>

01:13:09.251 --> 01:13:10.719
Whew.

01:13:12.988 --> 01:13:15.356
Congratulations.

01:13:15.422 --> 01:13:16.457
Thanks.

01:13:16.524 --> 01:13:18.659
I think a part of me misses

01:13:18.726 --> 01:13:20.729
designing with you guys
for the masses,

01:13:20.796 --> 01:13:22.963
but it's a very small part.

01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:24.231
-Very small.
-Yeah.

01:13:24.297 --> 01:13:25.332
-This is cooler.
-Yeah.

01:13:25.399 --> 01:13:27.501
-Matthias.
-I know this guy.

01:13:27.569 --> 01:13:30.071
Matthias, thank you so much
for this whole party.

01:13:30.137 --> 01:13:31.139
This is so cool.

01:13:31.206 --> 01:13:32.207
It was an honor.

01:13:32.274 --> 01:13:34.909
Your art is so stimulating.

01:13:34.975 --> 01:13:37.679
Down, boy.

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:39.614
Seeing you and Jess
together tonight

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:44.785
gives me... how do you say...
extreme waves of pleasure.

01:13:44.853 --> 01:13:47.422
Maybe don't say it
like that.

01:13:49.157 --> 01:13:50.559
Oh, have you met Alexandra,

01:13:50.626 --> 01:13:52.561
the Nubian princess
running the coat check?

01:13:52.627 --> 01:13:54.328
-No.
-I have.

01:13:54.395 --> 01:13:56.097
And she has shared with me
a little secret.

01:13:56.163 --> 01:13:58.432
She has been lucid-dreaming
since the age of 17.

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:01.603
Tonight we are going
to paint the walls

01:14:01.668 --> 01:14:03.404
with all sorts of fluids.

01:14:03.470 --> 01:14:05.706
Maybe I will have
the art show.

01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:14.915
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

01:14:14.983 --> 01:14:16.650
I'd like you to meet Sophie,
my girlfriend...

01:14:16.717 --> 01:14:18.386
-Hi.
-Whose mother, by the way,

01:14:18.453 --> 01:14:19.654
is Annie Leibovitz's

01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:21.155
camera assistant.

01:14:21.222 --> 01:14:22.591
Yeah, Annie Leibovitz.

01:14:22.657 --> 01:14:25.560
That's definitely
a person Ford knows.

01:14:25.627 --> 01:14:26.695
Well, you know,
I used to be a fan

01:14:26.761 --> 01:14:28.596
of her early portrait era,

01:14:28.662 --> 01:14:29.897
but now it's
her post-bankruptcy era

01:14:29.965 --> 01:14:32.833
that absolutely has me
mind-blown.

01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:34.335
Wha-a-at?

01:14:34.402 --> 01:14:35.737
Look at you.

01:14:35.804 --> 01:14:37.572
Yeah, maybe sometime
we can all get together

01:14:37.639 --> 01:14:39.507
and go to dinner
with my mom and her.

01:14:39.573 --> 01:14:41.342
Yeah, that'd be great.

01:14:41.409 --> 01:14:42.976
See?
Isn't she just perfect?

01:14:43.043 --> 01:14:44.412
Yeah.

01:14:44.479 --> 01:14:45.847
Look at you, man.

01:14:45.913 --> 01:14:47.547
Everybody here
admiring your work.

01:14:47.614 --> 01:14:48.983
I'm proud of you.

01:14:49.050 --> 01:14:50.284
Thanks, man.

01:14:50.351 --> 01:14:53.454
Hey, I hope it's okay
that I came.

01:14:53.521 --> 01:14:56.224
Yeah, I... I think
it's great.

01:14:56.289 --> 01:14:59.760
I've been wanting to talk
to you guys about something.

01:14:59.828 --> 01:15:02.630
-You want us back.
-Both of us?

01:15:02.697 --> 01:15:04.332
-We have girlfriends now.
-Sorry, little late.

01:15:04.399 --> 01:15:06.401
-It was fun.
-It was fine.

01:15:06.466 --> 01:15:08.902
Uh, no, what I wanted
to tell you was

01:15:08.970 --> 01:15:10.372
I loved us.

01:15:10.439 --> 01:15:12.306
I really did care
about you guys.

01:15:12.372 --> 01:15:15.342
And I loved both of you.

01:15:15.409 --> 01:15:16.778
But I love you
more as friends,

01:15:16.845 --> 01:15:19.681
and that wasn't gonna happen
if I was in the picture.

01:15:19.747 --> 01:15:21.015
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

01:15:21.082 --> 01:15:24.051
I mean, we did make
a good couple,

01:15:24.118 --> 01:15:25.085
us three, right?

01:15:25.153 --> 01:15:27.389
Yeah, no, we were...
a throuple, really.

01:15:27.456 --> 01:15:28.789
-An adorable throuple.
-Yeah.

01:15:28.856 --> 01:15:30.091
Hey, you know, here.
Take our photo.

01:15:30.158 --> 01:15:31.826
It'll make the whole story
easier to explain

01:15:31.893 --> 01:15:33.127
when you're telling people.

01:15:33.194 --> 01:15:35.063
Yeah, all right.

01:15:35.128 --> 01:15:36.363
<i>Here's the deal.</i>

01:15:36.430 --> 01:15:37.898
<i>In the dating game,</i>

01:15:37.966 --> 01:15:39.734
<i>there are so many things
that can go wrong.</i>

01:15:39.801 --> 01:15:41.636
<i>We might not be done
making mistakes,</i>

01:15:41.703 --> 01:15:44.939
<i>but it finally feels like
we're getting it right.</i>

01:15:45.006 --> 01:15:47.742
<i>¶ Oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh ¶</i>

01:15:47.809 --> 01:15:49.677
<i>¶ Oh, oh, oh, oh ¶</i>

01:15:49.743 --> 01:15:50.911
<i>¶ Oh, oh... ¶</i>

01:15:50.978 --> 01:15:52.512
Should we go back
in coat check

01:15:52.579 --> 01:15:53.715
and make out
for a minute?

01:15:53.782 --> 01:15:54.849
Yeah, probably.

01:15:54.916 --> 01:15:57.251
<i>¶ Oh, oh, oh ¶</i>

01:15:57.318 --> 01:15:58.886
<i>¶ Oh, oh, oh ¶</i>

01:15:58.953 --> 01:16:00.622
Well...

01:16:00.689 --> 01:16:04.292
my period of celibacy
is over.

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:08.829
Human intercourse
is truly a magnificent act.

01:16:10.497 --> 01:16:12.067
Yeah.

01:16:12.134 --> 01:16:13.435
It's all yours.

01:16:13.502 --> 01:16:15.436
<i>¶ Oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh ¶</i>

01:16:15.502 --> 01:16:18.072
<i>¶ Oh, oh, oh, oh ¶</i>

01:16:18.139 --> 01:16:20.909
I don't know why
I just shook his hand.

01:16:20.975 --> 01:16:23.143
Maybe we should just
go back to my place.

01:16:23.211 --> 01:16:24.679
Yeah.

01:16:24.746 --> 01:16:26.780
<i>¶ Oh, oh, oh, oh ¶</i>

01:16:26.847 --> 01:16:29.149

oh, oh, oh, oh ¶</i>

01:16:29.216 --> 01:16:31.752
<i>¶ Oh, oh, oh ¶</i>

01:16:31.819 --> 01:16:36.724
<i>¶ I feel just like
I've been reborn ¶</i>

01:16:36.791 --> 01:16:39.328
<i>¶ Can you feel it too? ¶</i>

01:16:41.061 --> 01:16:45.432
<i>¶ I know that we have
survived the storm ¶</i>

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:49.203
<i>¶ So what can't we do? ¶</i>

01:16:49.270 --> 01:16:54.743
<i>¶ Oh, I believe
in a different perfection now ¶</i>

01:16:54.810 --> 01:16:58.313
<i>¶ No white picket fence ¶</i>

01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:05.420
<i>¶ Simply saying
that I'm never coming down ¶</i>

01:17:05.485 --> 01:17:07.654
<i>¶ We never touch the ground ¶</i>

01:17:07.721 --> 01:17:10.425

oh, oh, oh, oh ¶</i>

01:17:10.492 --> 01:17:12.594

01:17:12.661 --> 01:17:14.729

oh, oh, oh, oh ¶</i>

01:17:16.997 --> 01:17:19.134
