WEBVTT

00:04.280 --> 00:06.874
So I spent the night at Todd's.

00:06.960 --> 00:11.078
You remember Todd? The bass player
with the big hands. Big, nimble hands.

00:11.160 --> 00:13.958
- I'm trying to piece together a skull.
- Greatjob.

00:14.040 --> 00:18.113
So I wake up this morning and he's sitting
there. No clothes on, just his bass.

00:18.200 --> 00:23.433
Singing to me in this low,
low voice. It was creepy.

00:23.520 --> 00:28.230
- Is this conversation really appropriate here?
- Sorry, but I'm into alive people.

00:28.320 --> 00:31.630
- Anyway, Todd has a friend.
- I thought you said he was creepy.

00:31.720 --> 00:34.109
Todd, not the friend.

00:34.200 --> 00:37.078
- Good news. - I hope
this is work-related.

00:37.160 --> 00:43.838
<i>The Anthropology Journal is publishing our
piece on the evolution of the coronaI suture.</i>

00:43.920 --> 00:46.593
Worthy interruption.

00:48.520 --> 00:52.308
- You're meant to bump my fist with yours.
- Why?

00:52.400 --> 00:58.157
I'm told it's a widely acknowledged
gesture of mutuaI success.

00:58.240 --> 01:00.549
I love it when you
impersonate earthlings.

01:00.640 --> 01:04.519
This is weird. There's some guy in the
lounge who asked me to give you this.

01:04.599 --> 01:07.831
Is he alive? This is an
excellent start to a relationship.

01:07.920 --> 01:10.309
I didn't put a mirror
underneath his nose.

01:10.400 --> 01:14.279
He said you'd know who
he was when you opened it.

01:19.640 --> 01:24.236
OK, a guy who gets her to stop
working? This I have to see.

01:27.200 --> 01:30.590
- You left it at my place.
- Three years ago.

01:30.680 --> 01:34.070
My first time in Washington. I
thought I'd return it in person.

01:34.160 --> 01:37.516
- Why didn't you say you were coming?
- What if you didn't take my call?

01:37.600 --> 01:41.195
- You're a big important author now.
- You could come down, you know?

01:41.280 --> 01:43.430
You could come up.

01:44.320 --> 01:46.151
Halfway.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.958
As always.

01:51.040 --> 01:53.429
I hope you don't have any expectations.

01:53.520 --> 01:55.750
- Do you?
- Civility.

01:55.840 --> 01:59.515
- I can handle that.
- So why are you here?

01:59.600 --> 02:03.479
George Washington University wants me
to head their anthropology department.

02:03.560 --> 02:06.233
- They'd be lucky to get you.
- They tried you first.

02:06.320 --> 02:09.789
- I already had ajob.
- This is like watching cars mate.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.314
It's gotta be MichaeI. Stires.

02:12.400 --> 02:15.790
Her forensic anthropology
professor from Northwestern.

02:15.880 --> 02:19.190
- They were...
- Very, very close?

02:20.280 --> 02:24.193
Dr Brennan is my forensic anthropology
professor. Does that mean...?

02:24.280 --> 02:25.952
<i>No.</i>

02:26.040 --> 02:29.032
It seems like we should have
dinner tonight, catch up?

02:29.120 --> 02:32.715
- Sounds reasonable.
- Hey, Bones! Whoa.

02:32.800 --> 02:35.155
OK. Put it here. Easy.

02:35.240 --> 02:40.394
Bones, I got a present for you. Straight out
of an illegaI ravine on a dump in Fairfax.

02:40.480 --> 02:43.119
Our forensic people
confirmed it's human matter.

02:43.200 --> 02:47.398
So, rather than open it and risk being
trashed for contaminating the evidence,

02:47.480 --> 02:50.756
I decided to bring the
whole refrigerator to you.

02:50.840 --> 02:53.229
What we need is a toaster oven.

02:53.320 --> 02:55.629
Bones?

03:00.960 --> 03:03.349
The body's gonna be mostly decomposed.

03:03.440 --> 03:06.830
- Which is my cue to leave.
- This is where it gets fun.

03:06.920 --> 03:09.673
- All right, you can open it.
- All right.

03:13.480 --> 03:16.711
Oh! OK. Uh... he or she?

03:19.160 --> 03:21.628
- She.
- Late teens, early 20s.

03:21.720 --> 03:25.030
I'm guessing she's been in
the refrigerator for a year.

03:25.120 --> 03:27.998
Is there enough insect
activity to be more precise?

03:28.080 --> 03:30.833
There's always enough insect activity.

03:30.920 --> 03:33.559
Remove and clean the bones, Zack.

03:33.640 --> 03:37.474
MichaeI, you can pick me up at
7:30. I'll give you my address.

03:37.560 --> 03:40.279
- BeautifuI lab.
- Thanks.

03:40.360 --> 03:42.920
- Old friend?
- Old teacher.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.279
They're actually going to eat dinner after
seeing this? Well, I hope it's not soup.

03:48.360 --> 03:52.558
If she was his student and I'm
her student, then it follows...

03:52.640 --> 03:56.599
Ain't gonna happen, Zacko.
Not in this universe.

04:02.280 --> 04:06.990
Here's a sketch of the victim. Her skull
was intact so it made it easy to work with.

04:07.080 --> 04:12.074
I just got her dentaI records.
Name, Maggie Schilling. 19.

04:12.160 --> 04:15.232
Then I guess you don't need this.

04:16.279 --> 04:18.874
She was a dancer.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.349
Bone markers in her metatarsals.

04:21.440 --> 04:26.195
How do you go from the freedom of dance
to being crammed into a refrigerator?

04:26.280 --> 04:29.829
I hope she was already dead
when they shut the door.

04:30.640 --> 04:33.518
He's hotter than you said.

04:33.600 --> 04:35.033
MichaeI?

04:35.120 --> 04:37.839
Any other ex-lovers come
knocking on your door?

04:37.920 --> 04:40.275
The "ex" in ex-lover is not a variable.

04:40.360 --> 04:44.956
- It's a constant, like the speed of light.
- Save your dirty talk for the professor.

04:45.040 --> 04:49.955
I can assure you our relationship is purely
platonic. We share the love of science.

04:50.040 --> 04:54.477
Neither of us has the time or
inclination for emotionaI complications.

04:54.560 --> 04:58.758
- Sounds very reasonable.
- I have to get this data together for Booth.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.512
Sure.

05:02.200 --> 05:04.873
Have a good dinner tonight.

05:05.640 --> 05:08.871
Maggie Schilling went
missing 11 months ago.

05:08.960 --> 05:14.239
Her parents got a ransom note for S1 million.
Negotiations went on for a couple of weeks.

05:14.320 --> 05:18.472
Then all contact stopped. The assumption
was that the kidnappers killed her.

05:18.560 --> 05:21.120
- No visuaI physicaI trauma.
- Cause of death?

05:21.200 --> 05:24.510
Not yet. But there are stress
fractures on both wrists.

05:24.600 --> 05:29.993
We're running chemicaI analysis and toxicity
screens on the effluent in the refrigerator.

05:30.080 --> 05:34.790
- OK. You'll call me later?
- I'm not working tonight. I have a dinner.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.911
What? Wow.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.913
I just assumed that the two of you
would be eating off an autopsy table.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.639
- Not tonight.
- I was being...

05:45.720 --> 05:48.951
Tomorrow's fine. Call me tomorrow.

05:50.000 --> 05:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:00.080 --> 06:02.958
- We missed our reservation.
- Ah, well.

06:03.040 --> 06:06.715
That's the price we pay for
scientific exploration and discovery.

06:06.800 --> 06:10.873
You realise this is just
recreationaI, MichaeI.

06:10.960 --> 06:15.636
Of course. I'm just impressed that we can pick
up where we left off like no time has passed.

06:15.720 --> 06:18.029
Well, time is an imposed construct.

06:18.120 --> 06:21.795
It's nice to know we
can rely on physics.

06:21.880 --> 06:25.077
You really think you'll move here?

06:25.160 --> 06:27.071
Depends on the offer.

06:27.160 --> 06:29.754
I could get you a position
at the Jeffersonian.

06:29.840 --> 06:33.230
- Working for my old student?
- Would that be a problem?

06:33.320 --> 06:37.279
Well, we're better when we're not
vying for dominance in the same arena.

06:37.360 --> 06:39.396
I can't help it if I'm usually right.

06:39.480 --> 06:42.950
Does that mean you've closed the
case on that girI in the fridge?

06:43.040 --> 06:48.160
I found some stress fractures on
the wrist. Not much else. But I will.

06:48.240 --> 06:52.711
- Same old confident Brennan.
- I'm sorry. Is schooI in session?

06:55.240 --> 06:57.834
Old habits die hard.

06:57.920 --> 07:00.832
She did fight, MichaeI.

07:00.920 --> 07:05.948
They kept her... tied up like an animaI.

07:06.040 --> 07:08.838
But she fought.

07:08.920 --> 07:14.677
That's how she got those stress fractures,
because she was bound and struggling.

07:15.760 --> 07:17.796
I just...

07:17.880 --> 07:20.348
I keep seeing her face.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.238
You know how it is.

08:00.280 --> 08:03.909
Using a refrigerator to hide a
body. It's kinda perfect, isn't it?

08:04.000 --> 08:08.073
Good way to remove the victim. The
rubber gaskets seaI in the odour.

08:08.160 --> 08:10.674
Maybe the company should
use that in their ads.

08:10.760 --> 08:13.957
- She's late. She's never late.
- You worried about her?

08:14.040 --> 08:16.474
- I'm happy for her.
- Why?

08:16.560 --> 08:20.235
- Remember that time you were late?
- Oh. Yeah.

08:20.320 --> 08:22.436
Good morning, all.

08:24.400 --> 08:27.756
<i>Hey, you can take the day
off. You deserve one day.</i>

08:27.840 --> 08:29.831
MichaeI wanted to see our equipment.

08:29.920 --> 08:33.196
I'm gonna let that one go. The
guys wanted to meet him anyway.

08:33.280 --> 08:36.955
- They could learn a lot from him.
- You were Brennan's professor?

08:37.039 --> 08:39.429
She was 23. An adult.

08:39.520 --> 08:43.399
- That's what Clinton said.
- You run through a lot of students?

08:43.480 --> 08:47.678
That was a long time ago. Tempe was very
advanced. More colleague than student.

08:47.760 --> 08:50.354
I'm a pretty advanced student.

08:50.440 --> 08:52.908
No offence, but I'm not interested.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.915
- No, uh, I meant me and her.
- Oh, burn.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.592
What have you found?

08:59.680 --> 09:03.992
X
- rays reveaI low bone density and the parathyroid hormone levels are also low.

09:04.080 --> 09:06.594
There is a condition,
hyperparathyroidism...

09:06.680 --> 09:09.240
Symptoms are muscle
weakness, brittle bones.

09:09.320 --> 09:12.596
- Your struggle theory may be premature.
- I doubt that.

09:12.680 --> 09:16.195
- You mean you don't want to be doubted.
- I can take it.

09:16.280 --> 09:18.748
The fractures could
be from her condition.

09:18.840 --> 09:22.674
- Unlikely. However...
- Or unrelated nontraumatic fissures.

09:22.760 --> 09:24.990
Nontraumatic? Look at these.

09:25.080 --> 09:27.116
Well, it's something to consider.

09:27.200 --> 09:31.239
You don't want to jump to conclusions.
I know you want to find who did this.

09:31.320 --> 09:35.233
This seems like an appropriate
moment to discuss human goop.

09:35.320 --> 09:40.348
ChemicaI analysis of the liver and kidney
tissues reveaI evidence of hydromorphone.

09:40.440 --> 09:43.238
- Hydromorphone?
- Also known as hospitaI heroin.

09:43.320 --> 09:47.632
- In what kind of concentration?
- Given her size and weight, it's fataI.

09:47.720 --> 09:50.029
- Where did you go to dinner?
- We stayed in.

09:50.120 --> 09:55.114
We need to know if that amount was accrued
over time or was delivered in one large dose.

09:55.200 --> 09:58.351
- You didn't come back to the lab, did you?
- I made a frittata.

09:58.440 --> 10:01.432
Oh, wow. He cooks,
too. Can we share him?

10:01.520 --> 10:05.354
We need to know if it was
administered intravenously or orally.

10:05.440 --> 10:08.876
I should go. I'm meeting with
the board at the university.

10:08.960 --> 10:11.713
It was nice meeting you all.

10:14.080 --> 10:19.279
What? Is it so odd for
everyone to see me with a man?

10:20.120 --> 10:22.953
Print out the levels of
hydromorphone in her system.

10:23.040 --> 10:26.237
Find the overload point that
caused fractures in her wrist.

10:26.320 --> 10:32.316
And examine the left ilium. There seems to
be some kind of degeneration on the edge.

10:34.800 --> 10:39.078
I know it sounds terrible, but I
hoped that she had just run away.

10:39.160 --> 10:42.596
That way I could believe
she was still alive.

10:43.920 --> 10:46.912
She started turning
against us in high schooI.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.036
Did a lot of drugs.

10:49.120 --> 10:52.078
We tried to help her.
Sent her to rehab, therapy.

10:52.160 --> 10:56.790
- Kids have a lot to contend with these days.
- We didn't help her, not really.

10:56.880 --> 11:00.031
We had nannies to raise
her because we were so busy,

11:00.120 --> 11:03.430
and we sent her to shrinks
instead of talking to her.

11:03.520 --> 11:04.873
Don't blame yourself.

11:04.960 --> 11:09.033
Environment plays a
huge role in development.

11:11.800 --> 11:15.509
I'd like some pictures of Maggie so
I can compare them with her remains.

11:15.600 --> 11:18.717
Pictures of her dancing would
be most helpfuI, or swimming.

11:18.800 --> 11:22.634
- How do you know she danced and swam?
- Some things can't be erased.

11:22.720 --> 11:26.679
I'm sorry. But I need to ask you
about your daughter's drug problems.

11:26.760 --> 11:31.914
- Do you know what she was using?
- AlcohoI, ecstasy, marijuana.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.958
What about the narcotic hydromorphone?

11:35.040 --> 11:36.837
HospitaI heroin?

11:36.920 --> 11:38.273
Doesn't sound familiar.

11:38.360 --> 11:42.717
She had a thyroid condition.
Was anything prescribed for that?

11:42.800 --> 11:45.598
Her endocrinologist might know.

11:48.280 --> 11:51.192
<i>We have to find who did this to Maggie.</i>

11:51.280 --> 11:53.555
We have to do this for her.

11:55.120 --> 11:59.591
Maggie's condition didn't respond to
medication. I wanted her to agree to surgery.

11:59.680 --> 12:02.353
What types of medication
are we talking about?

12:02.440 --> 12:05.671
Furosemide, pamidronate. I
tried various calcitonins.

12:05.760 --> 12:07.591
What about hydromorphone?

12:07.680 --> 12:12.117
There is no pain with hyperparathyroidism,
but I knew Maggie had a drug problem.

12:12.200 --> 12:17.149
She was interested in getting opiates.
She bribed my office manager for samples.

12:17.240 --> 12:20.630
- I'll need your office manager's
address. - Ex-office manager.

12:20.720 --> 12:25.430
She's gonna be what you
call a disgruntled employee.

12:26.520 --> 12:30.115
I didn't give Maggie those
samples. She boosted them herself.

12:30.200 --> 12:34.352
- Barragan blamed me so he could fire me.
- Why did he fire you?

12:34.440 --> 12:39.434
Because he's a horn dog. I tried to keep
things professionaI. You know what I mean?

12:39.520 --> 12:42.876
He said you were closer to
Maggie than any other patient.

12:42.960 --> 12:45.030
- Did you meet her parents?
- Yes.

12:45.120 --> 12:48.157
Then you know she was pretty
much on her own. We took her in.

12:48.240 --> 12:51.232
He said you went out together.
That you took her to clubs.

12:51.320 --> 12:53.515
We just felt sorry for her, you know?

12:53.600 --> 12:56.797
She was lonely so we showed
her a good time, right?

12:56.880 --> 12:58.757
<i>We went on a road trip.</i>

12:58.840 --> 13:02.913
<i>Yeah, the three of us
ended up in Atlantic City.</i>

13:11.520 --> 13:13.397
<i>.. pills, vodka, weed.</i>

13:13.480 --> 13:17.189
Mary wanted Maggie to go
to meetings, you know? AA.

13:18.400 --> 13:22.791
That's very kind of you. Let's
talk about your new refrigerator.

13:23.480 --> 13:25.118
Why?

13:25.200 --> 13:29.352
Mainly I'd like to know what
happened to your old one.

13:32.880 --> 13:35.110
<i>We've got the FHA coming.</i>

13:35.160 --> 13:39.199
The fridge we found her in is a match
with the marks on the Costellos' floor.

13:39.280 --> 13:44.149
- They're sadomasochistic fetishists.
- Yeah. Turned the basement into a fun room.

13:44.240 --> 13:47.949
Seeking sexuaI gratification
through the manipulation of power.

13:48.040 --> 13:52.158
Probably the oldest of fetishes -
master-slave. It's all about dominance.

13:52.240 --> 13:55.676
This comes up when the bloom goes
off the rose. Know what I mean?

13:55.760 --> 13:59.878
- I don't know what you mean.
- When it gets old, you need to spice it up.

13:59.960 --> 14:03.077
- When the sex is good, you don't need help.
- That's for sure.

14:03.160 --> 14:04.798
- I'm sorry?
- I was agreeing.

14:04.880 --> 14:06.836
Well, don't. It freaks me out.

14:06.920 --> 14:11.516
I'm just saying that I've no inclination
toward pain or dominance when it comes to sex.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.431
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.432
Because you can be very bossy.

14:18.720 --> 14:23.748
Look at him, huh? Ooh, look at him. All
smiley. I bet he just loves these things.

14:23.840 --> 14:26.035
These could explain the fractures.

14:26.120 --> 14:31.797
Her bones were brittle from the disease.
Struggling would cause the cracks we saw.

14:35.720 --> 14:39.269
The handcuffs are consistent
with the injuries to her wrists.

14:39.360 --> 14:41.999
Maybe she wanted to be
cuffed. Think about that?

14:42.080 --> 14:46.119
Here's what I was thinking. Female
- dominant, strapped for cash -

14:46.200 --> 14:49.112
meets wealthy teenager on
the outs with her parents,

14:49.200 --> 14:52.033
convinces her husband
to hold her for ransom.

14:52.120 --> 14:55.556
- Any proof? Or is it story time?
- You feed her pills to keep her quiet.

14:55.640 --> 14:59.713
The negotiations drag on. She dies of
an overdose before an exchange is made.

14:59.800 --> 15:04.874
You seaI her up in a refrigerator and you
and your honey go back to playing "tie me up".

15:04.960 --> 15:09.033
<i>Maggie was an adult. We don't deny
she was in the house, even cuffed.</i>

15:09.120 --> 15:13.272
We don't deny there was a legaI
sexuaI relationship which got rough.

15:13.360 --> 15:17.273
- But Maggie was a willing participant.
- And enthusiastic.

15:17.360 --> 15:20.477
You have no evidence
my clients killed her.

15:20.560 --> 15:24.394
It's weird for you, huh? Being
the one that's all locked up.

15:25.160 --> 15:29.756
The way you come at me, are you
threatened or do I turn you on?

15:31.160 --> 15:33.355
Now I'm the one who's hating psychology.

15:33.440 --> 15:40.073
If you don't have anything but those cuffs,
my clients will be out of here in 24 hours.

15:45.200 --> 15:47.555
I was right about how
she got the fractures.

15:47.640 --> 15:52.668
- I don't have the time. I have an appointment.
- The university can wait a few minutes.

15:52.760 --> 15:55.399
It's with someone they want me to meet.

15:55.480 --> 15:59.712
- If we start debating evidence, I'll be late.
- There's nothing to debate.

15:59.800 --> 16:03.634
I can prove that Maggie Schilling
was bound in fur-covered handcuffs.

16:03.720 --> 16:07.554
We found strands of matching fur
embedded in the scaphoid and the lunate.

16:07.640 --> 16:10.996
- You can't prove it was involuntarily.
- Oh, yes, I can.

16:11.080 --> 16:14.470
- It's not a competition.
- No. The Olympics are a competition.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.391
Ours is a struggle to the death.

16:16.480 --> 16:19.040
Want to bet dinner?

16:19.120 --> 16:22.999
Yes. If we make it to a restaurant.

16:23.080 --> 16:25.548
- Bet's on. You got 10 minutes.
- OK.

16:25.640 --> 16:29.952
<i>Pull up the frontaI and lateraI
view of the victim's lower fibulas.</i>

16:30.040 --> 16:32.110
You trained her well, Doc.

16:32.200 --> 16:36.113
She's brilliant. Little cocky, though.

16:36.200 --> 16:38.111
Yeah. Tell me about it.

16:38.200 --> 16:43.479
<i>- Here's the left... Here's the right.
- Good partner. What you see is what you get.</i>

16:43.560 --> 16:46.518
That's a rare quality.

16:46.600 --> 16:49.672
<i>- This is between us, isn't it?
- MichaeI?</i>

16:50.640 --> 16:54.110
Dr Brennan found marks on the
mediaI malleoli, left and right.

16:54.200 --> 16:55.269
Her legs were bound.

16:55.360 --> 16:58.238
Mirror erosion patterns
from the bones rubbing.

16:58.320 --> 17:03.599
If this were the result of sex games, then
the legs, they wouldn't be bound together.

17:03.680 --> 17:10.074
Come on. Looking for a little nookie, the
last thing you tie together are the legs.

17:10.160 --> 17:11.912
I'm not convinced.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.549
Brittle bones from her condition.
It could've happened in a short time.

17:15.640 --> 17:19.109
We also found inflammation on
her right humerus and ilium.

17:19.200 --> 17:23.079
The abnormalities show pathosis from
Iying in one position for a long time.

17:23.160 --> 17:25.720
The only explanation
is long-term bondage.

17:25.800 --> 17:29.429
Decreased bone density could've
caused it. This isn't definitive.

17:29.520 --> 17:35.629
- There's a nice French place I'd like to try.
- I still have five minutes.

17:39.480 --> 17:43.917
- My department still works with Polaroids.
- So what do you think?

17:44.000 --> 17:47.629
Very Impressive. Especially
to the nonprofessionaI.

17:47.720 --> 17:51.076
You want science? Give me the
estimated time of captivity.

17:51.160 --> 17:54.197
Approximately three weeks.

17:55.320 --> 18:00.838
OK, here are your affected areas. Now,
during an advanced time simulation...

18:06.800 --> 18:09.109
You're winning, right?

18:09.920 --> 18:12.388
Can I see your findings?

18:17.600 --> 18:20.034
This appears to be indisputable.

18:20.120 --> 18:23.749
The narcotic in her system was
not from recreationaI drug abuse.

18:23.840 --> 18:27.310
The inflammation would've been
painfuI. The pain would've increased.

18:27.400 --> 18:31.279
They upped the dose of hydromorphone
till they gave her too much. She died.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.920
Those people bound and killed that girI.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.356
I yield. French restaurant?

18:37.440 --> 18:39.556
I'm more in the mood for Italian.

18:39.640 --> 18:43.633
I need to put together the evidence
for Booth to deliver to the US Attorney.

18:43.720 --> 18:46.393
I'll meet you at your place.

18:47.600 --> 18:50.194
Good work.

18:50.600 --> 18:53.068
Do you really think he
can handle your success?

18:53.120 --> 18:56.271
Because of today? No, we've
always been competitive.

18:56.360 --> 19:00.797
I know. But he's a man. And his
student, a woman, has surpassed him.

19:00.880 --> 19:03.474
MichaeI is extremely secure, Ange.

19:03.560 --> 19:06.393
Honey, when you stuck it
to him today, he was upset.

19:06.480 --> 19:10.155
It was a healthy debate between
scientists. You don't know MichaeI.

19:10.240 --> 19:13.550
I know men. I know what happens
when two people sleep together.

19:13.640 --> 19:17.519
- It's not like that. We're colleagues.
- Colleagues with benefits.

19:17.600 --> 19:21.878
I don't know what that means, but
MichaeI and I are not involved.

19:21.960 --> 19:26.875
I'm sorry if it's difficult for you to
understand, but what we have isn't traditionaI.

19:26.960 --> 19:31.590
Don't talk to me about traditionaI.
OK? I've dated circus people.

19:31.680 --> 19:36.879
You and MichaeI, you have something.
And that's OK. That's good, even.

19:36.960 --> 19:38.757
Just be honest about it.

19:38.840 --> 19:40.592
Bones?

19:40.680 --> 19:45.151
Judge is holding them without baiI. The
US Attorney wants to send you flowers.

19:45.240 --> 19:47.629
Facts are facts.

19:47.720 --> 19:52.475
Bones, I have to ask. How much have
you been sharing with the professor?

19:52.560 --> 19:54.915
- None of your business.
- I mean, on the case.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.070
I've bounced everything off him. Why?

19:57.160 --> 19:59.833
- Keep him out of it from now on.
- Out of it? Why?

19:59.920 --> 20:02.388
You know that appointment
that he had today?

20:02.480 --> 20:06.359
- Yeah.
- He met with the Costellos' lawyer.

20:07.280 --> 20:10.352
MichaeI is their expert witness.

20:10.440 --> 20:14.399
It's his job to tear apart
the case that you've built.

20:19.160 --> 20:23.039
How could I not be upset?
Basically you were spying on me.

20:23.120 --> 20:25.998
Spying? It's a criminaI proceeding.

20:26.080 --> 20:29.629
You're required by law to disclose
your findings to the defence.

20:29.720 --> 20:33.190
I only have to provide the raw
facts we'll enter into evidence,

20:33.280 --> 20:36.909
not the process by which
I arrived at those facts.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.878
I apologise. That nuance had escaped me.

20:39.960 --> 20:43.111
Why didn't you just tell me, MichaeI?

20:43.200 --> 20:46.795
The defence doesn't have to
tell the prosecution anything.

20:46.880 --> 20:49.314
It's grounds for a mistriaI.

20:49.400 --> 20:54.633
Look, I've never done this before. You're the
teacher in this situation. I'm the student.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.836
A little competitive.

20:56.920 --> 21:00.037
Part of the job at the university
is to be an expert witness.

21:00.120 --> 21:04.352
And, yes, I would like to do
thatjob at least as well as you.

21:04.440 --> 21:09.878
But if you feeI I've overstepped some
boundary here, I'll back out of the case.

21:09.960 --> 21:11.837
No.

21:11.920 --> 21:15.276
But if you stay on, you have
to move back to the hoteI.

21:15.360 --> 21:18.033
- Really?
- Yes.

21:19.520 --> 21:24.799
Well, would I have to do it tonight? Or
should I order another bottle of wine?

21:24.880 --> 21:27.838
I suppose tomorrow would be soon enough.

21:28.640 --> 21:31.029
I apologise, Tempe.

21:42.200 --> 21:46.034
- He still at it?
- Yep. And it is fascinating.

21:46.120 --> 21:50.875
- I want you to keep an eye on him.
- That's not going to be a problem.

22:02.800 --> 22:05.519
Did you just give them
a sign of encouragement?

22:05.600 --> 22:11.277
It's the first time I've looked at them without
imagining Moe knocking their heads together.

22:11.360 --> 22:13.874
Booth, you're accessing
your inner squint.

22:13.960 --> 22:18.511
You listed a fracture on the right femur.
It looks minor. Do you consider it evidence?

22:18.600 --> 22:22.559
Dr Brennan's conclusions
belong to the prosecution.

22:22.640 --> 22:25.950
I don't want to destroy your
case. I'm trying to get a sense...

22:26.040 --> 22:29.669
Of her interpretations of data, to
which you are not privy, Dr Stires.

22:29.760 --> 22:34.709
I understand the game the doctor is playing.
I'm capable of dealing with him myself.

22:34.800 --> 22:37.519
I'm sure he's thrown by
findings he'd have missed.

22:37.600 --> 22:39.670
This is not about you and Dr Stires.

22:39.760 --> 22:43.514
This is about our reputation
as a source of expert witnesses.

22:43.600 --> 22:46.273
OK, I'm... I'm on my own.

22:47.360 --> 22:51.638
Oh, in the interest of fairness, I am
willing to share my thoughts with you.

22:51.720 --> 22:54.598
I red-pencilled a few things.

22:54.680 --> 22:59.117
- You corrected my findings?
- Consider it an opposing opinion.

22:59.200 --> 23:02.397
My findings are based on
facts, MichaeI, not opinions.

23:02.480 --> 23:05.677
You've finished your allotted
time with the remains.

23:05.760 --> 23:10.276
- I'd like my people to get back to work.
- Thank you.

23:13.800 --> 23:15.518
- You OK?
- Why wouldn't I be?

23:15.600 --> 23:19.718
Cos the Nutty Professor's grading
your paper. What'd he give you, anyway?

23:19.800 --> 23:24.828
- I was always happy with a B.
- Well, I never got a B and I never will.

23:24.920 --> 23:27.150
That's my girI.

23:27.840 --> 23:32.311
US Attorney Levitt. Jury consultant
Joy Deaver. Dr Temperance Brennan.

23:32.400 --> 23:35.710
Nice to meet you. I looked at
your findings. We're in good shape.

23:35.800 --> 23:38.678
- Thank you.
- Butjuries don't like you.

23:38.760 --> 23:41.399
- Excuse me?
- I've seen you testify before.

23:41.480 --> 23:44.517
- You come off cold and aloof. I want...
- Cold and aloof?

23:44.600 --> 23:49.549
Don't interrupt. You sound arrogant. Don't
front-load your testimony with technicaI crap.

23:49.640 --> 23:51.471
This is not the best approach.

23:51.560 --> 23:54.632
I'm a technicaI witness. I've
testified in over 30 trials.

23:54.720 --> 24:00.192
The experts you've come up against are
dry and boring. Have you seen their expert?

24:00.280 --> 24:04.239
- She's seen him, Ms Deaver.
- Well, then you understand my concern.

24:04.320 --> 24:09.678
Professor Stires is open,
charming, great-looking.

24:09.760 --> 24:11.955
Jury's gonna love him. I love him.

24:12.040 --> 24:15.999
This isn't a personality contest.
It's about data we present to the jury.

24:16.080 --> 24:18.275
You're kidding, right?

24:18.360 --> 24:22.672
The women on the jury won't listen to a
word he says. They'll be undressing him.

24:22.760 --> 24:26.639
I don't want the men on the jury
to be putting more clothes on you.

24:26.720 --> 24:31.191
Wear blue. It suggests truth. Make eye
contact with the jury. Lose the necklace.

24:31.280 --> 24:33.953
The Costellos murdered Maggie Schilling.

24:34.040 --> 24:36.759
The forensic data proves
it. That should be enough.

24:36.840 --> 24:39.035
- But it isn't enough.
- That's great.

24:39.120 --> 24:42.510
We'll take that under
consideration. Thanks.

24:45.880 --> 24:49.270
Why didn't she say anything
about you? You can be irritating.

24:49.360 --> 24:51.430
Bones, she's an expertjust like you.

24:51.520 --> 24:56.913
She has an obvious personality disorder,
but she wants to help. Just try.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.275
- OK, sure.
- Good.

25:00.400 --> 25:01.879
I can do it.

25:22.560 --> 25:27.918
Mary Costello lured Maggie Schilling
into her home with the promise of drugs.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.797
She was not held against her will.

25:29.880 --> 25:34.237
She was, in fact, orchestrating the plot
to extort money from her own parents,

25:34.320 --> 25:36.117
from whom she was estranged.

25:36.200 --> 25:39.272
They bound her for
weeks, the pain growing.

25:39.360 --> 25:42.272
And to keep her quiet, they
pumped her full of drugs.

25:42.360 --> 25:45.158
She died from a
self-administered overdose.

25:45.240 --> 25:49.279
After killing their captive and ruining
their chances of getting a ransom,

25:49.360 --> 25:52.796
they stuffed Miss Schilling's
body into the refrigerator.

25:52.880 --> 25:55.269
Knowing they could be accused of murder,

25:55.360 --> 25:57.749
my clients panicked and
disposed of her body.

25:57.840 --> 26:02.755
While their behaviour might be ill-advised,
they are neither kidnappers nor murderers.

26:02.840 --> 26:06.992
Samples of hydromorphone were
found in the Costellos' belongings.

26:07.080 --> 26:10.356
The lot numbers match those that
were in Dr Barragan's office.

26:10.440 --> 26:16.231
When I went to the Costellos' kitchen, I saw
marks from the old refrigerator on the floor.

26:16.320 --> 26:20.916
It was like these marks,
they screamed at me:

26:21.000 --> 26:23.594
"These people, they did it. "

26:23.680 --> 26:26.831
- Objection.
- Sustained. Just the facts, Agent Booth.

26:26.920 --> 26:29.275
Sorry. The receipt for
the new refrigerator

26:29.360 --> 26:33.512
was dated two days after the negotiations
broke off with the kidnappers.

26:33.600 --> 26:37.434
I mean, you figure it
out. I know. I'm sorry.

26:37.520 --> 26:40.193
Any evidence she wasn't
a willing participant

26:40.280 --> 26:44.114
in sexuaI activity involving those
cuffs and other paraphernalia?

26:44.200 --> 26:50.639
Winding up in the fridge tells me that she
really wasn't that into it. No direct evidence.

26:50.720 --> 26:54.349
Any evidence my clients forced Miss
Schilling to take that narcotic?

26:54.440 --> 26:57.557
I'II leave those
answers for the experts.

26:57.720 --> 27:02.669
Sciarids, also known as dark-wing fungus
gnats, went through severaI life cycles.

27:02.760 --> 27:05.479
<i>Also present were Acaridae and Anotidae.</i>

27:05.560 --> 27:11.112
But the most interesting find was not a
bug at all, but was common bread mould.

27:11.200 --> 27:15.955
All this data led to the same conclusion.
She was in that refrigerator between ten...

27:16.040 --> 27:21.353
Even though we had medicaI and dentaI
records to identify Maggie Schilling,

27:21.440 --> 27:25.638
I was also asked to do a sketch based
on the architecture of her skull.

27:25.720 --> 27:28.314
That's sort of what I do.

27:30.600 --> 27:34.559
Turned out pretty accurate,
if I do say so myself.

27:34.640 --> 27:39.430
She was a pretty girI.
That's why I drew her smiling.

27:39.520 --> 27:42.876
It... itjust seemed right.

27:42.960 --> 27:47.078
I'm really sorry for what happened
to her. And I hope my work helps you.

27:47.160 --> 27:49.230
The gelatinous puddle was tissue

27:49.320 --> 27:54.030
from which our labs extracted and
analysed liver and kidney samples.

27:54.120 --> 27:59.592
The hydromorphone leveI in her
liver was 8.4 and 6.6 in her kidney.

27:59.680 --> 28:04.310
Death occurs at 7.7
and 5.2 respectively.

28:04.400 --> 28:06.675
And why would they
give her this narcotic?

28:06.760 --> 28:11.470
Short-term periosteaI reaction on
the right proximaI lateraI humerus

28:11.560 --> 28:13.835
was consistent with a bound individuaI.

28:13.920 --> 28:17.913
- So to rephrase...
- Wrist restraints with hyperparathyroidism

28:18.000 --> 28:24.348
would account for the stress fractures on the
distaI anterior surface of the radii and ulnae.

28:24.440 --> 28:28.956
Her bones broke because she
was struggling to free herself.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.679
Yeah. I believe I just said that.

28:34.680 --> 28:38.195
Thank you, Doctor.
That'll be all for now.

28:38.280 --> 28:41.829
I'd like a recess with the right
to recall the witness, Your Honour.

28:41.920 --> 28:45.993
OK. We'll meet back here in 30 minutes.

28:46.080 --> 28:49.595
She can't connect. Those
killers are gonna walk.

28:54.440 --> 28:57.591
- It was well-reasoned. -
Yeah, it was very scientific.

28:57.680 --> 29:02.310
You didn't listen to a thing I said.
You were like Klaatu the robot up there.

29:02.400 --> 29:06.518
- Would it have killed you to speak English?
- I wore blue, I looked at the jury.

29:06.600 --> 29:11.116
- For a people person, you're a little rude.
- When did the facts stop working for you?

29:11.200 --> 29:14.590
I have no problem with facts as
long as the jury understands them.

29:14.680 --> 29:18.878
- You underestimate their intelligence.
- You overestimate their ability to stay awake.

29:18.960 --> 29:24.990
When these S-and-M perverts walk
on this, it'll be on your head.

29:25.080 --> 29:27.833
Can you believe that?

29:27.920 --> 29:30.718
- What? You agree with her?
- Well, not entirely.

29:30.800 --> 29:33.439
Not entirely? So that means partly.

29:33.520 --> 29:36.671
I was perfectly clear.
Didn't you think I was clear?

29:36.760 --> 29:39.069
Sometimes. And...

29:40.240 --> 29:44.199
sometimes you were...
a little hard to follow.

29:44.280 --> 29:48.512
- What are you talking about? When?
- When you were... talking.

29:48.600 --> 29:51.751
I know you care about this case.
You should let them see that.

29:51.840 --> 29:53.876
- I should perform?
- A little bit.

29:53.960 --> 29:57.111
See how I portrayed myself
as a no-nonsense, tough cop?

29:57.200 --> 29:59.794
- You are a no-nonsense,
tough cop. - Exactly.

29:59.880 --> 30:02.713
It wouldn't hurt if the
jury saw who you really are.

30:02.800 --> 30:09.148
I don't know who you think that is, Booth,
because this is who I really am. Just this.

30:10.560 --> 30:12.232
God! Sorry.

30:12.320 --> 30:14.880
I'm OK. Are you?

30:14.960 --> 30:17.952
Sure. Well...

30:18.040 --> 30:22.033
Truthfully, this whole thing is
pretty awkward, don't you think?

30:22.120 --> 30:26.159
- We're just doing ourjob. You'll be fine.
- They have this jury consultant.

30:26.240 --> 30:30.233
They want to turn this into a melodrama.
They don't know what a scientist is.

30:30.320 --> 30:32.880
- We're not allowed to talk about this.
- I know.

30:32.920 --> 30:38.677
- My guy's gonna freak if he sees us talking.
- Sure. Sorry.

30:39.640 --> 30:44.873
In my opinion, the levels of hydromorphone
are more consistent with recreationaI use.

30:44.960 --> 30:47.633
Could you explain?

30:47.720 --> 30:53.716
I might not use all the technicaI language,
but I'll try to make myself understood.

30:53.800 --> 30:56.758
Objection. The witness is
impugning another witness.

30:56.840 --> 30:58.990
Sustained. Continue.

30:59.080 --> 31:01.833
I'm sorry. I, um, I don't
do this professionally.

31:01.920 --> 31:05.708
People who need to relieve physicaI
pain stop after the pain disappears.

31:05.800 --> 31:09.031
It doesn't take more than an
average dose to accomplish that.

31:09.120 --> 31:12.078
Drug users are trying
to bury emotionaI pain,

31:12.160 --> 31:15.675
which means that they will
medicate untiI they feeI nothing.

31:15.760 --> 31:18.638
So they tend to overdose,
like Maggie Schilling.

31:18.720 --> 31:22.508
Sometimes intense chronic pain
does not respond to medication.

31:22.600 --> 31:24.192
I'll bring it up.

31:24.280 --> 31:29.149
What about the claim that her pain was
linked to being bound for a length of time?

31:29.240 --> 31:32.835
The Costellos have stipulated
that they bound Miss Schilling

31:32.920 --> 31:35.832
as part of their rather
unorthodox sexuaI life.

31:35.920 --> 31:40.232
And Dr Brennan agrees that
Miss Schilling had hyperpara...

31:40.320 --> 31:45.110
Well, if I can simplify, a thyroid
condition that could weaken her bones.

31:45.200 --> 31:47.839
No need to look for bondage scenarios.

31:47.920 --> 31:49.876
He's ignoring all the facts.

31:49.960 --> 31:54.397
With respect to my former
student, Dr Brennan,

31:54.480 --> 31:57.916
I don't know why she became
a forensic anthropologist.

31:58.000 --> 32:01.879
She seems to have ignored all but her
preconceived notions about the case.

32:01.960 --> 32:04.076
- Objection.
- Sustained.

32:04.160 --> 32:08.517
- I apologise.
- Do you disagree with Dr Brennan's data?

32:08.600 --> 32:12.912
Well, sometimes doctors can use data
to confuse a very simple situation.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.673
I mean, I'm a doctor and
I could hardly follow her.

32:15.760 --> 32:20.356
This case is about people, not
incomprehensible technicaI jargon.

32:20.440 --> 32:23.273
These people shouldn't
be convicted of murder

32:23.360 --> 32:26.989
- just because Dr Brennan sounds smart.
- Your Honour, really!

32:27.080 --> 32:31.358
The jury will disregard Professor
Stires' personaI view of Dr Brennan.

32:31.440 --> 32:34.955
Court will adjourn untiI 9am tomorrow.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.270
Don't worry about a thing, OK?

32:37.360 --> 32:40.875
He wasn't acting as an objective
expert. He was making up a story.

32:40.960 --> 32:43.554
The judge chastised
him. That'll work for us.

32:43.640 --> 32:46.313
The hell it will. The jury loves Stires.

32:46.400 --> 32:51.155
He looks like a regular guy who's can't speak
the truth because stupid rules get in the way.

32:51.240 --> 32:53.470
The rules ofjurisprudence aren't stupid.

32:53.560 --> 32:57.792
Dr Brennan, you need to learn the
difference between reality and perception.

32:57.880 --> 33:00.440
- A triaI is all about perception.
- Wow.

33:00.520 --> 33:03.637
You're the reason
civilisation is declining.

33:03.720 --> 33:06.951
- Talk to her.
- I kind of agree with her.

33:10.240 --> 33:14.392
- Thanks.
- I don't agree with you, I just don't like her.

33:14.480 --> 33:17.358
Put me back on the stand. I
can rebut everything he said.

33:17.440 --> 33:20.637
- She can do this.
- I'll think about it.

33:22.480 --> 33:25.790
I've never been in this position.
I need to get back up there.

33:25.880 --> 33:28.792
All right. Just let me talk to him.

33:33.720 --> 33:36.314
TriaI going badly?

33:37.680 --> 33:41.070
You don't usually cram
at the last minute.

33:42.600 --> 33:48.596
The jury likes MichaeI better than they
like me. Apparently that's a problem.

33:50.400 --> 33:52.118
Are they stupid?

33:52.200 --> 33:54.111
Compared to you, yes, they are.

33:54.200 --> 33:59.957
However, compared to you, most
of the world is a little stupid.

34:00.640 --> 34:03.074
You have many skills, Temperance.

34:03.160 --> 34:06.596
Not one includes communicating
with the average person,

34:06.680 --> 34:09.148
which is exactly whatjuries are made of.

34:09.239 --> 34:11.993
I am a better forensic
anthropologist than MichaeI.

34:12.080 --> 34:14.799
Which is why two years ago
I hired you instead of him.

34:14.880 --> 34:17.235
- MichaeI applied for this job?
- Yes.

34:17.320 --> 34:19.708
- His credentials are better than mine.
- Yes.

34:19.800 --> 34:26.194
But you are the more rationaI,
reasoned, empiricaI scientist.

34:26.280 --> 34:28.510
And you care.

34:28.600 --> 34:34.038
And if he tries to convince you
otherwise, tell him to go to hell.

34:41.800 --> 34:45.475
- Is it safe to approach, Dr Brennan?
- Don't charm, MichaeI.

34:45.560 --> 34:48.472
- You're taking this personally.
- I should be rationaI?

34:48.560 --> 34:49.913
- Yes.
- Go to hell.

34:50.000 --> 34:53.117
You're not the only one with a
consultant. I listened to mine.

34:53.199 --> 34:55.714
He told me to create
reasonable doubt. I did.

34:55.800 --> 34:59.554
This one isn't about winning a dinner
or showing up your former student.

34:59.640 --> 35:03.235
It's about putting two people away
who murdered a 19-year-old girI.

35:03.320 --> 35:05.151
You can't personalise the work.

35:05.240 --> 35:09.028
Do you remember standing in a
mass grave guarded by soldiers?

35:09.120 --> 35:13.511
We knew they were the same soldiers who
killed the people we were digging up.

35:13.600 --> 35:18.594
I was just a student. I was scared. I
turned to you and I asked, "What do we do?"

35:18.680 --> 35:21.353
That was a different place and context.

35:21.440 --> 35:26.230
You said, "We tell the
truth. We do not flinch. "

35:26.320 --> 35:28.595
You flinched, MichaeI.

35:32.400 --> 35:35.790
I can't ask her that. The line
of questioning isn't relevant.

35:35.880 --> 35:38.838
He brought it up, so legally
you can reintroduce it.

35:38.920 --> 35:44.233
- I don't see how it's gonna change anything.
- Trust me, it will.

35:44.320 --> 35:46.550
Am I testifying?

35:47.600 --> 35:50.433
Only a prolonged struggle,
not sexuaI activity,

35:50.520 --> 35:54.798
would cause a tearing of the gastrocnemius
muscle on the distaI portion of the bone.

35:54.880 --> 35:57.599
- So, in lay terms...?
- The muscle avulsed.

35:57.680 --> 36:00.433
- She pulled a muscle.
- Because she was immobilised.

36:00.520 --> 36:04.308
- Tied up.
- These conditions have to be contextualised.

36:04.400 --> 36:06.516
The inflammation on the ilium,

36:06.600 --> 36:12.550
<i>the stress fractures on the wrists
have to be contextualised, the...</i>

36:12.640 --> 36:15.996
Dr Brennan, why did you become
a forensic anthropologist?

36:16.080 --> 36:17.069
Pardon?

36:17.160 --> 36:20.311
There must be a reason you chose
this out of the other careers

36:20.400 --> 36:22.709
someone of your
intelligence could choose.

36:22.800 --> 36:25.268
Was there some emotionaI
reason, perhaps?

36:25.360 --> 36:29.069
- Objection. Relevance?
- How does this pertain to the case?

36:29.160 --> 36:32.232
Dr Brennan is cold, distant
and alienating, Your Honour.

36:32.320 --> 36:36.199
I need the jury to know why, so they
might be willing to accept her testimony.

36:36.280 --> 36:40.956
- Her personality issues are not relevant.
- They opened up this line of questioning.

36:41.040 --> 36:45.352
Dr Stires wondered why Dr Brennan
became a forensic anthropologist.

36:45.440 --> 36:47.670
The defence must've thought it relevant.

36:47.760 --> 36:52.231
Sorry, Mr Meredith. You did
raise the issue. Overruled.

36:52.320 --> 36:54.515
You may continue, Mr Levitt.

36:54.600 --> 36:59.071
Dr Brennan, your parents
disappeared when you were 15.

36:59.160 --> 37:04.393
And no one's ever found out what
happened to them. Isn't that correct?

37:05.760 --> 37:09.355
Please, answer the question, Dr Brennan.

37:13.120 --> 37:17.750
- That's correct.
- It must be very painfuI.

37:17.840 --> 37:22.277
Is it fair to say you've tried to solve
the mystery of their loss your whole life?

37:22.360 --> 37:24.032
Do I want answers? Yes.

37:24.120 --> 37:29.194
As how that has affected my behaviour,
I don't put much stock in psychology.

37:29.280 --> 37:31.589
Is that why you wrap
yourself in technospeak?

37:31.680 --> 37:34.194
So the victims don't
remind you of your parents?

37:34.280 --> 37:36.919
My job doesn't depend on how I feeI.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.389
But it's informed by it.

37:39.480 --> 37:43.314
Or are you as cold and
unfeeling as you seem?

37:53.560 --> 37:56.358
I see a face on every skull.

37:56.440 --> 38:01.275
I can look at their bones and tell
you how they walked, where they hurt.

38:01.360 --> 38:06.639
Maggie Schilling is reaI to me.
The pain she suffered was reaI.

38:06.720 --> 38:10.429
Her hip was being eaten away by
infection from Iying on her side.

38:10.520 --> 38:16.595
Sure, like Dr Stires said, the disease could
contribute to that if you take it out of context.

38:16.680 --> 38:21.117
But you can't break Maggie
Schilling down into little pieces.

38:21.200 --> 38:24.988
She was a whole person
who fought to free herself.

38:25.080 --> 38:28.789
Her wrists were broken from
struggling against the handcuffs.

38:28.880 --> 38:32.316
Her ankles were ground together
because her feet were tied.

38:32.400 --> 38:36.188
Her side, her hip and her shoulder
were being eaten away by infection.

38:36.280 --> 38:40.990
The more she struggled, the more pain she
was in. They gave her drugs to keep her quiet.

38:41.080 --> 38:43.878
They gave her so much it killed her.

38:43.960 --> 38:49.193
These facts can't be ignored or
dismissed because you think I'm...

38:49.280 --> 38:52.158
boring, or obnoxious,
because I don't matter.

38:52.240 --> 38:57.951
What I feeI doesn't matter.
Only she matters. Only Maggie.

39:03.920 --> 39:05.148
Tempe. Tempe.

39:05.240 --> 39:07.356
Tempe, I'm sorry.

39:07.440 --> 39:09.829
What can I do?

39:12.600 --> 39:17.469
Bones. The Costellos are trying to cop a plea
to a charge that won't mean the death penalty.

39:17.560 --> 39:20.233
- They know they're going down.
- You had no right.

39:20.320 --> 39:24.154
- There are things that are private.
- Yeah. Maybe you're right.

39:24.240 --> 39:30.554
But you know what? This was my case,
too. All right? So, nothing personaI?

39:45.760 --> 39:48.638
Guilty on all counts.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.551
Yeah.

39:50.640 --> 39:55.430
- So he owes you another dinner, huh?
- No. I won't be seeing him any more.

39:56.840 --> 39:58.831
Sorry.

39:59.800 --> 40:03.270
I was foolish to be so open
with him. It was irrationaI.

40:03.360 --> 40:07.114
- You know how you get when you're tired.
- Yeah.

40:08.200 --> 40:11.431
- You want to go out? Grab a drink?
- Um...

40:12.520 --> 40:14.909
I think I just want to work.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.797
OK.

40:21.280 --> 40:24.317
- Hey, Bones.
- What is it? I'm not feeling very forgiving.

40:24.400 --> 40:27.631
Yeah, I know, but... we have a case.

40:46.040 --> 40:49.589
Victim is an adult
male, 35 to 40 years old.

40:49.680 --> 40:53.753
From the pattern of the burning, I'd say
an accelerant was used. Hand me my bag?

40:53.840 --> 40:55.512
Yeah. Sure.

40:55.600 --> 40:58.034
Listen, do you want my
coat? It's cold up here.

40:58.120 --> 41:02.193
- If I did, I'd ask for it.
- Yeah. Sorry.

41:03.280 --> 41:05.999
And, uh... I'm sorry.

41:07.360 --> 41:13.959
You had something to accomplish. You found
a logicaI way of getting what you needed.

41:16.080 --> 41:18.878
I probably would've done the same thing.

42:09.800 --> 42:14.555
