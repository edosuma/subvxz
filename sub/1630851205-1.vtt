[dramatic music]

00:30.378 --> 00:31.727
- [Sammy] "I Love Us."

00:33.120 --> 00:34.860
When I first heard those words,

00:34.947 --> 00:36.166
I thought they were
the corniest three little words

00:36.253 --> 00:38.342
I ever heard in my life.

00:39.691 --> 00:40.779
- You like it?

00:42.216 --> 00:43.391
- I love it.

00:43.478 --> 00:45.480
- [Sammy] I love us,
who says that?

00:45.567 --> 00:47.699
- I know it's not much, but--

00:47.786 --> 00:49.875
- I don't need a ring
to know how you feel.

00:49.962 --> 00:51.834
I don't need anything.

00:51.921 --> 00:54.010
That look in your eyes
says it all.

00:54.097 --> 00:56.578
- Deposit's non-refundable.

00:56.665 --> 00:58.101
- We'll take it.

00:58.188 --> 00:59.842
- If you would have
told me five years ago,

00:59.929 --> 01:01.931
those three little words would
be the most important words

01:02.018 --> 01:04.325
in my life one day,
I would have told you

01:04.412 --> 01:05.456
three other little words.

01:05.543 --> 01:07.110
Shut the fuck up!

01:07.197 --> 01:09.156
Well, technically four.

01:09.243 --> 01:11.201
- What?
I'm just saying, Sammy.

01:11.288 --> 01:14.291
This fucking guy should've
been closed an hour ago.

01:14.378 --> 01:15.640
We're sitting here
like a bunch of yutzes

01:15.727 --> 01:18.208
waiting for these fucking
love birds to split.

01:18.295 --> 01:20.558
Gotta piss so bad
I can taste it.

01:20.645 --> 01:22.691
- Are you finished?

01:22.777 --> 01:25.563
- I'm just saying, we could've
been in and out already.

01:25.650 --> 01:27.217
- Waiting is part
of the business, Richie.

01:27.304 --> 01:29.089
- Yeah, waiting.

01:29.176 --> 01:31.439
Waiting, I mean, one minute
we're cocked and loaded

01:31.526 --> 01:32.788
and the next minute
we're watching

01:32.875 --> 01:35.356
some fucking asshole
overcompensating

01:35.443 --> 01:37.358
with his sidepiece
for an hour?

01:37.445 --> 01:40.360
- One minute can
change everything.

01:40.448 --> 01:44.146
Just so we're clear,
this mook is not my partner.

01:44.234 --> 01:46.235
We're not even friends.
He's an associate.

01:46.323 --> 01:48.369
An over-glorified co-worker.

01:48.456 --> 01:50.414
Okay, here he goes.

01:50.501 --> 01:51.937
Bring the car around.

01:52.024 --> 01:53.156
All right, five minutes.

01:53.243 --> 01:55.723
Right out front
and five minutes.

01:55.811 --> 01:57.508

[car door clunking]
[dramatic music]

02:04.167 --> 02:06.604
- [Sammy] I don't like blood
and for a job like this,

02:06.691 --> 02:08.170
there's no need for any.

02:08.258 --> 02:11.043
[car engine roaring]
[dramatic music]

02:11.131 --> 02:12.567

02:20.531 --> 02:21.750
[dramatic music]

02:21.837 --> 02:23.447
Leave it at the door!

02:23.534 --> 02:25.841
- [Sammy] Nobody pisses their
pants at the sight of a box.

02:25.928 --> 02:27.625
Everybody loves boxes.

02:27.712 --> 02:30.062
It reminds them of their
birthdays or Christmas.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.108
Everybody loves Christmas.

02:32.195 --> 02:34.545
- You're lucky I'm still here.

02:34.632 --> 02:36.329
- [Sammy] A gun, though,
has a very different

02:36.417 --> 02:38.853
and specific effect on people.

02:38.941 --> 02:40.725
Nobody likes guns, especially
when they're pointed

02:40.812 --> 02:42.118
at their fat belly.

02:42.204 --> 02:47.123
[dramatic music]

02:58.308 --> 03:00.354
The difference between
a good thief and a hack

03:00.441 --> 03:02.704
is simple--greed.

03:02.791 --> 03:04.706
You get greedy, you get sloppy.

and kept the change,

so that's all we're taking.

03:33.517 --> 03:34.692
And what's the difference
between a good thief

03:34.779 --> 03:35.998
and a great one?

03:37.781 --> 03:38.740
The getaway.

04:53.641 --> 04:54.859
I wasn't kidding when
I said that one minute

04:54.946 --> 04:56.774
could change everything,

04:57.906 --> 04:59.995
but I was wrong.

05:00.082 --> 05:02.084
It only took a second.

05:02.171 --> 05:02.911
Hey.

05:04.869 --> 05:05.653
- Hey.

05:07.698 --> 05:10.875
- She could have trademarked
that smile.

05:10.962 --> 05:12.050
Wanna get off?

05:13.095 --> 05:15.010
- No, uh...

05:15.097 --> 05:16.794
I'm not that type of girl,
sorry.

05:16.881 --> 05:20.102
- No, no, not get off.
You wanna get off the bus?

05:20.189 --> 05:22.974
Maybe we can get some dinner?

05:23.061 --> 05:24.715
- Can't.

05:24.802 --> 05:26.543
Girl's gotta work.

05:32.201 --> 05:33.898
- I just got off work.

05:34.943 --> 05:35.813
- Lucky you.

05:38.207 --> 05:40.383
- Lucky was an understatement.

05:40.470 --> 05:42.211
Where do you work?

05:42.298 --> 05:44.822
- Vincent's.

getting off?

05:58.488 --> 05:59.271

06:01.186 --> 06:03.275
Maybe I'll come after dinner.
I love Vincent's.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.103
I hate Vincent's.

An Italian restaurant with
nothing but non Italians.

06:09.412 --> 06:11.283
They can cook some
pretty incredible shit,

06:11.371 --> 06:14.461
but nobody messes up a plate
of pasta like Vincent's.

06:14.548 --> 06:18.247

06:18.334 --> 06:22.382
Ooh, the caprese.
Great choice.

06:22.469 --> 06:24.209
Fettuccine, no problem.
And for you?

06:24.296 --> 06:26.560

a nightmare,

06:26.647 --> 06:29.345
but the service is
an absolute dream.

06:29.432 --> 06:30.999

[smooth jazz music]

So tell me, what is it
that you do, Sammy?

06:52.542 --> 06:53.761

- Mm-hmm.

06:53.848 --> 06:54.718
- I'm a thief.

I'm a diamond dealer.

take the bus?

07:11.387 --> 07:12.823
Too many DUIs?

07:12.910 --> 07:15.913
- No, no, no, no, nothing
serious like that, no.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.481
Having to lie to her
tore me apart even then.

07:18.568 --> 07:21.702

07:30.406 --> 07:31.799
- Serendipity.

- Serendipity.

Well, here's to serendipity.

12:24.395 --> 12:25.222
I'm so sorry.

12:25.309 --> 12:27.616
- No, Laura, it's fine, no.

12:27.703 --> 12:30.445
I'm sure it's not easy
on them.

12:30.532 --> 12:31.707
- You're sweet.

12:33.143 --> 12:35.493
I'm gonna go check on dinner.

12:37.713 --> 12:38.453
Rachel!

12:47.549 --> 12:48.463
- This is delicious.

12:48.550 --> 12:49.725
Really is.

12:49.812 --> 12:51.596
- Well, I'm so glad
you like it.

12:51.683 --> 12:53.555
- Like it? I love it.

12:53.642 --> 12:55.252
- It's just meatloaf.

12:56.645 --> 12:59.387
- This meatloaf,
it's a masterpiece.

13:00.388 --> 13:02.303
- Mom's meatloaf is lit.

13:02.390 --> 13:04.000
- Meatloaf can't be lit.

13:04.087 --> 13:05.306
- Yes, it can.

13:06.263 --> 13:08.178
- No it can't.
That doesn't make sense.

13:08.265 --> 13:10.311
- It means it's really good.

13:10.398 --> 13:12.182
- I know what it means.
- There's no competition.

13:12.269 --> 13:14.576
It's the best meatloaf
I've ever had in my life.

13:14.663 --> 13:15.316
- The best.
- Mm.

13:16.752 --> 13:17.797
- And so are you.
- Mm.

13:21.104 --> 13:23.150
- Well, wait till you taste
dessert. We made cupcakes.

13:23.237 --> 13:25.326
- That's exactly what you need,
Audrey, more cupcakes.

13:25.413 --> 13:27.632
- [Audrey] Shut up.
- [Laura] Girls.

13:29.896 --> 13:31.506
- Make sure not to get
too many crumbs on mom

13:31.593 --> 13:33.813
while you're kissing her ass.

13:34.726 --> 13:36.772
- Rachel!

13:38.165 --> 13:39.296
I'm sorry.

13:39.383 --> 13:41.908
- No, no, no, that's fine.

13:41.995 --> 13:43.692
It's fine.

13:43.779 --> 13:46.477
Cheers, guys.
Thank you for having me.

13:46.564 --> 13:47.696
- Thank you.

13:47.783 --> 13:49.045
Cheers.

13:49.132 --> 13:50.481
- Nice meeting you, Audrey.

13:50.568 --> 13:52.440
- You, too.

13:55.269 --> 13:56.531
- You're really brave,
you know that?

13:56.618 --> 13:58.750
[insects chirping]

13:58.838 --> 13:59.534
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.406
- I guess.

14:02.493 --> 14:04.234
- I'm serious.

14:05.714 --> 14:07.281
It can't be easy for you either.

14:07.368 --> 14:09.892
[insects chirping]

14:09.979 --> 14:12.112
- I mean, I must seem
like an intruder

14:12.199 --> 14:14.070
to these girls, right?

14:14.157 --> 14:15.506
- Well...

14:15.593 --> 14:16.638
they'll be fine.

14:16.725 --> 14:18.466
It's just gonna take some time.

14:18.553 --> 14:20.381
[insects chirping]

14:20.468 --> 14:22.383
- I thought they were gonna
fall in love with me

14:22.470 --> 14:23.993
in first sight,
just like you did.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.821
[Audrey and Rachel laughing]

14:25.908 --> 14:28.563
- You know, on the bus,
when I first saw you,

14:28.650 --> 14:31.479
I kind of thought
you were a creep.

14:31.566 --> 14:32.175
- A creep?
- [laughs]

14:33.394 --> 14:35.483
- Really?
- I did.

14:35.570 --> 14:36.614
You're lucky I didn't
have my other purse

14:36.701 --> 14:38.834
with my pepper spray and taser.

14:38.921 --> 14:40.096
- Ooh, pepper spray.

14:40.183 --> 14:40.923
- Yeah.

14:42.925 --> 14:44.971
- Yeah, you're right, I am.

14:46.146 --> 14:47.843
- You are what?

14:47.930 --> 14:49.497
- Lucky.

14:50.846 --> 14:52.804
- Yeah, you are.
[laughs]

14:53.849 --> 14:55.503
I love them so much.

14:55.590 --> 14:57.418
[Rachel and Audrey laughing]

14:57.505 --> 14:58.810
- And I love you.

15:02.162 --> 15:04.381
- And I love you.

15:04.468 --> 15:06.427
- [Sammy] I could've married
her right then and there.

15:06.514 --> 15:08.255
[upbeat music]

15:08.342 --> 15:11.127
But I married her a year later.

15:11.214 --> 15:14.348
Her mother, who we barely
got up the stairs,

15:14.435 --> 15:16.393
even her junkie brother
was there.

15:16.480 --> 15:18.395
Nice guy, but a hot mess.

15:19.657 --> 15:20.789
In front of her girls.

15:20.876 --> 15:23.618
[upbeat music]

15:24.532 --> 15:26.621
All these people showed up
to see us.

15:26.708 --> 15:29.276
- [Laura] I love us.

15:29.363 --> 15:31.800
- And all I can think about
is that one person who didn't.

15:31.887 --> 15:34.368
[upbeat music]

15:39.721 --> 15:40.591
[knock on door]

15:40.678 --> 15:43.116
[upbeat music]

15:48.251 --> 15:50.123
Hey, Pops, what are you doing?

15:52.734 --> 15:54.910
- That's for the job

15:54.997 --> 15:57.391
and here...

15:57.478 --> 15:59.045
from me.

15:59.306 --> 16:01.003
Wedding gift.

16:02.744 --> 16:04.572
You know, showing up
to the wedding

16:04.659 --> 16:06.574
would have been a good gift,
you know that, right, Pop?

16:06.661 --> 16:08.271
- Uh, don't be so sure.

16:08.358 --> 16:09.620
You haven't seen
what's inside the envelope.

16:09.707 --> 16:13.973
[chuckles] Thank you, Pop.
I appreciate it.

16:14.060 --> 16:14.799
- So...

16:18.238 --> 16:20.196
You're married, huh?

16:20.283 --> 16:21.371
- Look at this.

16:24.331 --> 16:25.767
- I don't know what
your mother would've felt

16:25.897 --> 16:29.466
about you marrying a goya,
but I'm sure the food was good.

16:29.553 --> 16:32.121
The food was great.
Mom would've loved her.

16:32.208 --> 16:36.560
- Maybe. I mean, you know
your mother better than I did.

16:36.647 --> 16:38.040
- You gonna love her too, Pops.

16:38.127 --> 16:40.303
She's awesome. She really is.

16:40.390 --> 16:42.044
- How are the kids?

16:42.131 --> 16:43.785
Ooh. Kids, tough.

16:45.178 --> 16:46.744
Big one, Rachel,
hates my guts.

16:46.831 --> 16:48.920
It's like I killed
her dad myself.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.358
The little one,
Audrey, is really sweet,

16:51.445 --> 16:53.621
but, you know,
it's just tough.

16:53.708 --> 16:56.667
New guy coming in.

16:56.754 --> 16:59.801
At that age, it's not easy.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.587
- Do you want some advice?
- No, no, no, no, no.

17:03.674 --> 17:06.634
- Don't be their friend.
They got friends.

17:06.721 --> 17:09.115
- What part of "I don't want any
advice" don't you understand?

17:09.202 --> 17:12.814
- They don't need a friend.
They need a father.

17:14.858 --> 17:18.385
- Yeah, I guess.
- Here.

17:21.257 --> 17:23.694
This is a good lead.
Take a lock.

17:23.781 --> 17:25.608
Stake it out,
take Richie with you.

17:25.695 --> 17:27.133
- No, no, no, no,
I don't like Richie.

17:27.220 --> 17:29.352
- What's with you and liking
all of a sudden, huh?

17:29.439 --> 17:31.963
You don't have to like him,
all right?

17:32.051 --> 17:33.487
You don't have to go camping
with the guy.

17:33.574 --> 17:35.271
You sit in the back seat,
I told you.

17:35.358 --> 17:37.360
- I do. He doesn't stop
asking questions.

17:37.447 --> 17:40.581
- Well then,
stop answering them then, huh?

17:40.668 --> 17:44.150
- It's very easy to say.
The guy is unbelievable.

17:44.237 --> 17:48.632
- Look, I told you that I'm
gonna look out for you, right?

17:48.719 --> 17:51.113
You bang out a few more jobs,

17:51.200 --> 17:53.594
you'll be square with Ira
before you know it.

17:53.681 --> 17:55.639
- I know, Pops. I appreciate it.
I really do.

17:55.726 --> 17:57.859
It's just,
I can't lie to Laura anymore.

17:57.946 --> 17:58.686
- Lying?

18:00.470 --> 18:01.993
You tell her you work here,
right?

18:02.081 --> 18:03.647
- Yeah, I tell her I work here,
but...

18:03.734 --> 18:07.434
- Well, then... [laughs]
get to work.

18:07.521 --> 18:09.088
- I can't lie to her.

18:09.175 --> 18:11.220
I can't lie to those girls.
I mean, it's...

18:11.394 --> 18:13.266
It's my life now, you know?

18:13.353 --> 18:16.747
- Sammy, I know that
we throw the word job

18:16.834 --> 18:18.401
around here a lot, okay?

18:18.488 --> 18:22.666
But this isn't what you do.
It's who you are.

18:22.753 --> 18:24.277
You want some more advice?

18:24.364 --> 18:25.495
- No, please.

18:25.582 --> 18:27.410
- Just tell her.

18:27.497 --> 18:29.108
You want that life?

18:29.195 --> 18:31.371
You got to come clean.

18:31.458 --> 18:33.242
You build it on a foundation
of bullshit,

18:33.329 --> 18:35.026
that life will come tumbling
down one day,

18:35.114 --> 18:37.203
right on top of your head,

18:37.290 --> 18:40.249
and you won't be able to
do a damn thing about it

18:40.336 --> 18:42.382
except try to take the hit.

18:43.731 --> 18:45.559
- I guess, I don't know.

18:48.910 --> 18:49.693
[Sammy sighing]

18:49.780 --> 18:51.130
I don't know, Pops.

18:53.393 --> 18:55.308
Growing up,
I didn't need a friend either,

18:55.395 --> 18:56.918
but as far as fathers go,

18:57.005 --> 19:00.226
mine definitely made
a better boss.

19:00.313 --> 19:01.705
The name he just dropped,

19:01.792 --> 19:04.665
is why my posture is
so fucked up these days.

19:04.752 --> 19:07.581
[techno music]

19:07.668 --> 19:08.886
Ira Prince.

19:08.973 --> 19:10.061
Great guy,

19:11.280 --> 19:14.065
but Ira always had one hand
in someone's pocket

19:14.153 --> 19:18.461
and another wrapped gently
around their throats

19:18.548 --> 19:21.072
and his grip never felt tighter.

19:22.813 --> 19:24.075
I was a gambler.
Yes!

19:24.163 --> 19:25.512
A good one.
Yes! Yes!

19:25.599 --> 19:28.341
Which means I was also
a bad one.

19:28.428 --> 19:32.475
When I would hit, I would live
it up like a goddamn king.

19:32.562 --> 19:36.262
[upbeat music]
[ladies giggling]

19:36.349 --> 19:39.482
But when I got hit, you've
never seen a sorer loser.

19:39.569 --> 19:41.310
I hate this... [indistinct].

19:41.397 --> 19:43.094
One day I got hit really bad

19:43.182 --> 19:48.056
and I not only lost my money,
I lost my friends' money

19:48.143 --> 19:51.668
and I lost Ira's money.

19:52.060 --> 19:54.976
Ira and my dad go way back,
so as a favor to him,

19:55.063 --> 19:57.761
he took it easy on me.

19:57.848 --> 20:01.200
He agreed to let me pay
him back in installments.

20:01.287 --> 20:03.637
They say that if you do
something for 10,000 hours,

20:03.724 --> 20:05.726
you become a professional,
right?

20:05.813 --> 20:08.250
Well, I became
a fucking professional.

[upbeat music]

[car door clunking]

20:18.347 --> 20:19.957
What do we got?

20:20.044 --> 20:22.133
- Now, why do you have
to seat in the back seat

20:22.221 --> 20:24.310
like I'm your fucking chauffeur?

20:24.397 --> 20:27.530
- Technically, that's what
you are now.

20:27.617 --> 20:29.706
- Technically an asshole
is what you are.

20:29.793 --> 20:31.534
What do we have Richie?
What's going on over here?

20:31.621 --> 20:33.754
Explain to me, please.

20:33.841 --> 20:35.451
I never liked pawn shops.

20:35.538 --> 20:37.801
There's always one idiot
that wants to play the hero.

20:37.888 --> 20:40.848
- That chubby over there,
he comes out for a smoke break

20:40.935 --> 20:44.330
about every 15 minutes.
He's got a partner inside.

20:44.417 --> 20:46.157
That guy comes out at the end
of the day though, all right?

20:46.245 --> 20:48.334
- If I want to put this life
behind me,

20:48.421 --> 20:51.728
I gotta stop thinking small time
and start thinking big time.

20:51.815 --> 20:53.556

- Hey, sweetie.

20:53.643 --> 20:55.602

that we have dinner tonight?

- Oh, shit. No, no, no,
uh, I didn't forget.

[Laura] You know that I said
dinner at seven

- [Laura] Okay, I love you.
- I love you too, sweetie.

- [Laura] I'll see you soon.
- Okay.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.744
- I'll be there in a little bit.
- [Laura] Okay, bye.

a great job.

and I'll see you tomorrow.

- I thought I was just a driver.

- You are just a driver, Richie.

21:20.540 --> 21:22.019
This was it.

21:22.106 --> 21:25.849
Time to decide if I play
the friend card or the dad card.

As long as I didn't play

- We're having a Teddy talk.

21:52.180 --> 21:54.748
- Shit, I was playing with
the wrong fucking deck.

21:54.835 --> 21:56.053
A Teddy talk?

21:57.098 --> 21:59.796
- Yeah, Teddy.

He helps us get things
off our chests in a safe

22:16.117 --> 22:18.859
- No, we're not going
to Disneyland.

How'd you sleep?

35:04.928 --> 35:06.669
- [Audrey] It was okay.

35:08.889 --> 35:09.672
- Eggs?

35:11.413 --> 35:12.110
- Sure.

35:20.292 --> 35:22.120
- Where's your sister?

35:22.207 --> 35:23.817
- She's still asleep.

35:26.472 --> 35:28.300
- Scrambled okay?

35:28.387 --> 35:29.127
- Sure.

35:41.051 --> 35:41.791
Thank you.

35:51.149 --> 35:52.672
- Breakfast?

35:52.759 --> 35:53.499
- Sure.

36:05.685 --> 36:08.122
So, I took the day off
from work.

36:08.209 --> 36:10.211
We can do anything
you guys want.

36:10.298 --> 36:12.822
[cellphone buzzing]

36:14.346 --> 36:16.086
- [Audrey]
Can we go to Disneyland?

36:16.174 --> 36:19.307
- Okay, we got one
for Disneyland.

36:19.394 --> 36:20.961
What are you thinking?

36:21.048 --> 36:23.833
- How about the beach?
- Beach?

36:23.920 --> 36:26.271
- Yeah, mom loved the beach.

36:26.358 --> 36:29.056
- She did?
- Yeah.

36:31.537 --> 36:34.844
- Audrey, can we take
a rain check on Disneyland?

36:34.931 --> 36:37.804
- Can I make the sandwiches?

36:37.891 --> 36:39.109
- Yeah.

36:39.197 --> 36:41.373
Please make the sandwiches.

36:41.460 --> 36:42.504
- Okay.

36:42.852 --> 36:44.289
[buzzing continues]
- All right, you guys...

36:44.376 --> 36:48.423
you guys eat up and, um...
[buzzing stops]

36:48.510 --> 36:52.906
Eat up, and I'm gonna shower.
I'll just wash up.

36:52.993 --> 36:57.040
I went to bed so late.
All right, enjoy it.

37:07.355 --> 37:08.791
- [Audrey] You like my bear?

37:08.878 --> 37:10.184
- [Rachel] It's cute.

37:10.271 --> 37:12.360
- I told her that I hated
the beach.

37:12.447 --> 37:16.321
Couldn't stand the heat,
but I can see why she loved it.

37:16.408 --> 37:21.151
[ocean waves crushing]
[sea gulls cawing]

37:23.371 --> 37:25.068
How was it?

37:25.155 --> 37:26.722
- [Rachel] It's good,
it was cold.

37:26.809 --> 37:28.289
- [Audrey] Today, the water's
really cold.

37:28.376 --> 37:29.421
- It is?
- Yeah.

37:29.508 --> 37:31.597
- You guys hungry?
- [Rachel] Yeah.

37:31.684 --> 37:34.252
- Why don't you guys eat
something?

37:34.339 --> 37:36.036
- [Audrey] Thank you.

37:36.123 --> 37:37.429
- Thanks for making these.
- [Audrey] Yeah, of course.

37:37.516 --> 37:38.778
- They're really good.
I just had them.

37:38.865 --> 37:40.519
- [Audrey] Yeah?

37:40.606 --> 37:42.216
- [Rachel] Mom always said
you made the best sandwiches.

37:49.092 --> 37:52.879
- Ah, we should head back
in a little bit, right?

37:53.836 --> 37:56.448
[birds chirping]

37:57.884 --> 38:00.800
[car engine roaring]

38:17.817 --> 38:19.340
Guys, get in the house.

38:19.427 --> 38:20.689
- [Rachel] Who is that?

38:20.776 --> 38:22.604
- It's just a work thing.
Get in the house.

38:22.691 --> 38:24.606
Go straight to your room.

38:25.912 --> 38:26.826
Go ahead.

38:26.913 --> 38:28.001
[dramatic music]

38:28.088 --> 38:29.176
- Boss wants to see you.

38:29.263 --> 38:31.744
[dramatic music]

38:31.831 --> 38:35.661
- You know how long
I've been waiting here?

38:35.748 --> 38:37.489
A long fucking time,
that's how long.

38:37.576 --> 38:39.317
[car door closes]

38:39.404 --> 38:40.318
- I'm sorry.

38:43.233 --> 38:46.498
- Just, uh, busting your balls,
kid.

38:46.585 --> 38:48.717
I'm sorry for your loss.

38:48.804 --> 38:49.762
I really am.

38:52.504 --> 38:54.070
If anything you need, I, uh...

38:57.291 --> 38:58.292
- I'm okay, thank you.

38:58.379 --> 39:01.034
[dramatic music]

39:02.470 --> 39:03.210
Cried yet?

39:04.385 --> 39:05.125
- Cry?

39:06.779 --> 39:09.521
- You should find a spot.

39:09.608 --> 39:11.131
Just let it all out.

39:12.611 --> 39:14.917
Maybe in your car,
maybe in....

39:16.092 --> 39:17.180
in the shower.

39:17.267 --> 39:19.748
Showers are great for crying.

39:19.835 --> 39:22.447
[inhales sharply]

39:22.969 --> 39:25.841
Um...I asked, uh, Harvey, uh,

39:27.887 --> 39:32.413
for an update, and he told me
that he couldn't reach you.

39:34.284 --> 39:36.199
- Sorry about that. It's...

39:36.286 --> 39:38.724
I took the girls
to the beach to get some food,

39:38.811 --> 39:40.073
get some fresh air,

39:40.160 --> 39:42.554
so I didn't pick up my phone.

39:42.641 --> 39:44.338
- Uh...

39:44.425 --> 39:45.252
listen...

39:47.602 --> 39:51.780
You take some time,
get your head straight,

39:51.867 --> 39:54.130
do what you need to do
and when you're ready,

39:54.217 --> 39:55.218
you'll get...

39:56.655 --> 39:57.569
Back to work.

39:57.656 --> 40:00.920
[dramatic music]

40:01.007 --> 40:01.921
- Thank you.

40:03.662 --> 40:04.402
- And, uh...

40:04.489 --> 40:07.143
[dramatic music]

40:08.884 --> 40:10.625
- No, no, I can't.
I can't take that.

40:10.712 --> 40:13.672
- Oh, come on. Come on.

40:13.759 --> 40:17.545
Get those kids
some pizza or something.

40:17.632 --> 40:18.894
- Okay.

40:18.981 --> 40:21.288
Gangsters are a funny breed.

40:21.375 --> 40:23.725
Some of the nicest guys
you'll ever meet.

40:23.812 --> 40:25.988
You almost forget that
they're stone cold killers.

40:26.075 --> 40:26.902
- And, uh, Sammy...

40:29.078 --> 40:30.819
you stay reachable.

40:30.906 --> 40:32.299
- Yes, sir.

40:32.386 --> 40:33.866
Almost.

40:33.953 --> 40:35.433
[car door clunking]

40:35.520 --> 40:36.303
- Go.

40:37.435 --> 40:39.437
- Shut up! This is my bear.

40:39.524 --> 40:40.960
- So what if I cry?
- Shut up!

40:41.047 --> 40:43.571
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What's going on?!

40:43.658 --> 40:44.703
- She killed Teddy!
- What?

40:44.790 --> 40:47.619
- It's a fucking toy, Audrey!
Grow up!

40:47.706 --> 40:49.621
- Give it to me.
Give me the teddy bear.

40:49.708 --> 40:51.144
What happened?

40:51.231 --> 40:52.362
- She's acting like
a fucking little kid!

40:52.450 --> 40:53.929
Why are you taking her side?!

40:54.016 --> 40:55.322
- Watch your mouth!
You're acting like it's your--

40:55.409 --> 40:58.499
Are you serious right now?!
What are you doing?!

40:58.586 --> 40:59.935
- I'm the one holding
the fucking bear!

41:00.022 --> 41:01.937
Both of you shut the fuck up!

41:02.024 --> 41:03.461
- Watch your language.
You're scaring your sister.

41:03.548 --> 41:05.506
Give me the teddy bear.
- She's my sister,

41:05.593 --> 41:07.377
not your daughter,
and you're not my father!

41:07.465 --> 41:09.554
You'll never be my father!

41:11.512 --> 41:13.732
Did you really think
one picnic and one ice cream

41:13.819 --> 41:15.951
was gonna fucking
fix everything?!

41:16.038 --> 41:18.258
[dramatic music]

41:19.738 --> 41:21.783
- Give me the teddy bear, Rach.

41:21.870 --> 41:23.959
- You're the reason
my mom's dead.

41:24.046 --> 41:25.047
- Rachel!

41:25.134 --> 41:27.572
[dramatic music]

41:28.703 --> 41:29.443
[door slams]

41:33.926 --> 41:35.754
- Can you fix him?

41:35.841 --> 41:38.583
[slow piano music]

41:42.543 --> 41:43.370
- It's okay.

41:43.457 --> 41:46.242
[slow piano music]

42:00.213 --> 42:02.694
[slow piano music]

42:12.660 --> 42:15.837
It's so crazy when someone's
gone, just like that,

42:15.924 --> 42:18.187
right off the face of
the earth,

42:18.274 --> 42:20.625
and all that's left are a bunch
of pictures in your phone

42:20.712 --> 42:22.627
and some shaky video footage.

42:22.714 --> 42:24.019
[slow piano music]

42:24.106 --> 42:25.543
[laughter]

42:29.503 --> 42:31.592
God, I missed her.

42:31.679 --> 42:34.421
[slow piano music]

42:49.305 --> 42:52.482
[doorbell chimes]

42:53.396 --> 42:55.616
The doorbell ringing this
early is either a delivery,

42:55.703 --> 42:57.966
Jehovah's Witness,
or bad news.

43:00.882 --> 43:01.927
[doorbell chimes]

43:02.014 --> 43:02.841
Yeah, I'm coming!

43:12.111 --> 43:13.765
This looked like bad news.

43:13.852 --> 43:14.983
- Mr. Silverman?

43:15.070 --> 43:16.463
- Yeah.

43:19.292 --> 43:22.991
- Maria Campos,
Child Protective Services.

43:23.078 --> 43:27.213
Oh, that's my guy out there,
just in case.

43:27.300 --> 43:29.171
- In case of what?

43:29.258 --> 43:30.477
- Just in case.

43:32.914 --> 43:34.437
- This is a joke, right?

43:34.524 --> 43:36.962
- This is not a joke,
Mr. Silverman.

43:37.049 --> 43:38.790
- The girls need
to come with us.

43:38.877 --> 43:40.139
I'll give you a minute to
get their things together

43:40.226 --> 43:42.141
and say your goodbyes.

43:43.011 --> 43:44.012
- No, no, no,
it's not happening.

43:44.099 --> 43:45.579
Those are my girls in there.

43:45.666 --> 43:48.538
- Actually, they're not.
Until your case is finalized,

43:48.626 --> 43:50.671
the girls need to stay
with family.

43:50.758 --> 43:52.847
This is happening.

43:52.934 --> 43:54.806
We'll schedule the evaluations
as soon as possible

43:54.893 --> 43:57.199
and get all of the paperwork
in order.

43:57.286 --> 44:00.550
Look, the best case scenario,
this is temporary.

44:00.638 --> 44:04.163
- And the worst case scenario?

44:04.250 --> 44:06.469
- Let's just see what happens.
- What happens?

44:06.556 --> 44:09.559
This woman coming into my house
talking about family, family.

44:09.647 --> 44:12.258
I'm their family.
What other family do they have?

44:12.345 --> 44:13.868
I mean, where are
they gonna stay?

44:13.955 --> 44:15.174
Their grandmother lives
in a home.

44:15.261 --> 44:16.741
- I am not at liberty to say.

44:16.828 --> 44:18.133
- There was only one
other family member

44:18.220 --> 44:19.700
I can think of at that moment.

44:19.787 --> 44:22.485
I mean, I was still a bit drunk,
but right in that moment,

44:22.572 --> 44:24.705
I had an idea.

44:24.792 --> 44:27.969
What if they--
What if they lived with family?

44:28.056 --> 44:29.536
- That's what I just said.
[laughs]

44:29.667 --> 44:31.494
- No, no. What if they lived

44:31.581 --> 44:32.582
with family here in the house,
with me?

44:32.670 --> 44:34.889
[dramatic music]

44:34.976 --> 44:38.458
- Um... Well, I mean, I guess
technically that--

44:38.676 --> 44:42.941
- Technically is good then.
Technically is good.

44:43.028 --> 44:45.291
I gotta make a phone call.
Would you come in for a minute?

44:45.378 --> 44:46.596
- [Maria] Uh, okay.

44:46.684 --> 44:49.338
- Can he stay out here?
- [Maria] Sure.

44:49.425 --> 44:50.992
- Okay, please, come.
Five minutes.

44:51.079 --> 44:53.125
I just gotta call somebody.

44:56.911 --> 44:58.391
Is there anything I can get you?

44:58.478 --> 45:00.175
- No, please don't worry
about me. I'm good, thank you.

45:00.262 --> 45:01.481
- You sure? Okay, thank you.
- Yes.

45:01.568 --> 45:03.222
-[doorbell rings]
There he is.

45:10.620 --> 45:12.318
- Hey.
- There's a huge guy on your--

45:12.405 --> 45:13.623
- I know, I know. Come inside.

45:13.711 --> 45:15.408
I gotta introduce you
to someone.

45:15.495 --> 45:17.497
- Is this grass real?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on.

45:19.151 --> 45:19.847
Come, come, come.

45:22.502 --> 45:26.245
Ah, Maria, this is Rob Fenton.

45:26.332 --> 45:29.596
This is Maria Campos
from, uh, CPS.

45:29.683 --> 45:31.729
I was telling you on the phone.
- Hi, Mr. Fenton.

45:35.036 --> 45:37.909
- Would you like something
to drink? Uh...

45:37.996 --> 45:40.215
Want some orange juice?
I'll get you some orange juice.

45:42.957 --> 45:45.917
- Oh, God,
it looks different here.

45:48.180 --> 45:50.312
- Freshly squeezed.

45:50.399 --> 45:53.751
[juice pouring]

45:57.537 --> 45:58.364
There you go.

46:00.801 --> 46:02.498
Rob, listen, Missus, uh, Miss--

46:03.761 --> 46:05.763
- Miss.
- Miss Campos is here.

46:05.850 --> 46:08.156
She's helping me
with the adoption papers.

46:08.243 --> 46:10.811
The only way the girls can
actually live here with me

46:10.898 --> 46:13.161
is if there's a family member
living here.

46:13.248 --> 46:14.162
- [Maria] That's correct.

46:14.249 --> 46:15.947
- Correct?
- Yes.

46:16.034 --> 46:18.340
- I mean, everyone's been
through so much,

46:18.427 --> 46:19.820
especially the girls.

46:19.907 --> 46:20.952
- Wow, that's really good juice.

46:21.039 --> 46:22.344
- You like that orange juice?

46:22.431 --> 46:24.520
You can have as much
orange juice as you want.

46:24.607 --> 46:26.218
- But I already have a place.

46:26.305 --> 46:28.089
- Yeah, but this is
just a couple of weeks.

46:28.176 --> 46:30.613
- Yeah, maybe more,

46:30.700 --> 46:34.182
and if the papers go through,
you know, it's a process.

46:34.269 --> 46:35.749
- If the paperwork goes through.

46:35.836 --> 46:37.359
Well, I'm sure
it's gonna go through, right?

46:37.446 --> 46:39.971
- We'll see. We just
take it one day at a time.

46:40.058 --> 46:41.189
- So it's temporary?

46:41.276 --> 46:43.278
- It's definitely temporary.

46:43.583 --> 46:44.932
[door knob clicking]

46:45.019 --> 46:46.455
- [Audrey] Uncle Rob?

46:46.542 --> 46:49.894
- [Rob] Hey, look at you.

46:49.981 --> 46:52.113
How you doing?
Oh, my God!

46:53.027 --> 46:54.681
- [Audrey]
What are you doing here?

46:54.768 --> 46:55.943
- I invited your uncle
for breakfast.

46:56.030 --> 46:58.641
- Yeah, I'm having orange juice.

46:58.728 --> 46:59.817
- Teddy's dead.

47:01.122 --> 47:04.125
- [Maria] What?
- Teddy's dead.

47:04.212 --> 47:05.344
- Who's Teddy?
- It's just...

47:06.345 --> 47:07.607
- It's nothing,
it's a teddy bear.

47:07.694 --> 47:09.435
- Ah, honey,
can you do me a favor?

47:09.522 --> 47:11.829
Can you give please give us
a minute?

47:11.916 --> 47:14.222
- We'll hang out, okay?
See you.

47:15.615 --> 47:16.529
[whispers] She's so big.

47:17.399 --> 47:19.401
- Uh, so we're good?

47:23.623 --> 47:25.233
- Yeah, we're good.

47:25.320 --> 47:28.323
- Well, I just have to
update your paperwork,

47:28.410 --> 47:30.499
but we should be good,

47:30.586 --> 47:33.111
and I'll have to run a quick
background check on Mr. Fenton.

47:33.198 --> 47:35.330
- Background check?
- Yes.

47:35.417 --> 47:37.115
We'll keep in touch,
Mr. Silverman.

47:37.202 --> 47:38.203
- [Sammy] Uh, Silver.

47:38.290 --> 47:40.031
- Right.

47:40.118 --> 47:41.989
- Okay, thank you.
So, you'll call me?

47:42.076 --> 47:42.947
- I will.

47:43.034 --> 47:44.078
- Okay, great.

47:45.471 --> 47:47.777
I worked very hard to stay clean
on paper.

47:47.865 --> 47:50.563
You look me up anywhere and
I'm basically squeaky clean,

47:50.650 --> 47:51.912
but this guy...

47:51.999 --> 47:53.696
You're clean?

47:53.783 --> 47:55.524
- Yeah. I got allergies.

47:55.611 --> 47:57.657
- Allergies?
- That's why I'm sniffing.

47:57.744 --> 47:59.267
- Okay, good.
- Yeah.

47:59.354 --> 48:01.791
- Rachel! Your uncle's here!
- Rachel's here?

48:01.879 --> 48:04.838
- Yeah, sit,
I'll tell you everything.

48:04.925 --> 48:07.667
- Uncle Rob.
- [laughs]

48:07.754 --> 48:09.234
- What are you doing here?

48:09.321 --> 48:11.018
- [Rob] I'm hanging.

48:11.584 --> 48:13.325
- [both] Brr! [laughing]

48:13.412 --> 48:14.804
You'll get it next time.

48:14.892 --> 48:16.241
- What are you doing here?

48:16.328 --> 48:17.982
- Hanging out, yeah.

48:18.069 --> 48:19.331
- [Sammy] Your uncle's gonna
live with us.

48:19.418 --> 48:21.289
- Really?
- For a little bit, yeah.

48:21.376 --> 48:23.988
- Oh, that's awesome.
I'm gonna go brush my teeth.

48:24.075 --> 48:26.033
- Okay.
I wasn't gonna say anything.

48:26.120 --> 48:27.513
- [Sammy] All right.

48:27.600 --> 48:28.993
- [Rachel] Shut up.

48:32.344 --> 48:34.259
- It's crazy how much
she looks like her.

48:34.346 --> 48:35.564
- It's crazy. Hey...

48:35.651 --> 48:39.307
I really appreciate
you doing this.

48:39.394 --> 48:41.048
It means a lot.

48:41.135 --> 48:42.920
- I'd do anything for them.
- I know.

48:45.183 --> 48:46.836
I'll get you set up.

48:46.924 --> 48:48.403
If you need anything,
just let me know.

48:48.490 --> 48:49.578
- [Rob] Okay.
- All right?

48:49.665 --> 48:52.973
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you. Appreciate it.

48:53.060 --> 48:54.975
All I knew about Rob is
that he loved his sister,

48:55.062 --> 48:57.064
and she loved him.

48:57.151 --> 48:59.762
Now I gotta go hide
all my valuables.

48:59.849 --> 49:01.939
- You guys got any coffee?

49:04.724 --> 49:07.031
What? No?

49:07.422 --> 49:09.468
- Yeah, black okay?

49:09.555 --> 49:10.556
- Please.

49:14.473 --> 49:17.389
[coffee pouring]

49:17.476 --> 49:19.304
You guys don't eat ever?

49:24.352 --> 49:26.833
[mug clunks]

49:29.140 --> 49:31.359
[dramatic music]

49:31.446 --> 49:33.144
God, Rachel.

49:33.231 --> 49:35.233
It's crazy how much
you look like her.

49:35.320 --> 49:37.235
Sammy, right?

49:37.322 --> 49:39.063
[dramatic music]

49:40.151 --> 49:42.196
- Yeah, you really do.

49:43.284 --> 49:45.460
- I'm not her.

49:45.547 --> 49:48.463
- I know, I didn't...
I didn't mean it like that.

49:48.550 --> 49:50.291
- I know what you meant.

49:51.945 --> 49:53.251
Audrey looks like Dad.

49:55.209 --> 49:57.864
It's hard to forget someone
when you see them every day.

49:57.951 --> 50:01.824
- Well, you're not supposed
to forget.

50:01.911 --> 50:05.132
You're supposed to remember.
- Yeah, well, remembering sucks.

50:05.219 --> 50:08.135
[dramatic music]

50:08.222 --> 50:10.659
- I'm gonna make some coffee.

50:10.746 --> 50:12.531
You guys want some, Rachel?

50:12.792 --> 50:13.619
- No, I'm good.

50:18.493 --> 50:21.670
- All right, movie marathon
tonight, yeah?

50:21.757 --> 50:25.283
We stay up late,
popcorn, burping, farting.

50:25.370 --> 50:26.719
She's been farting all night,
so--

50:26.806 --> 50:29.678
- No, that was Teddy's corpse.

50:29.765 --> 50:31.245
- Teddy's?
- It's his ghost, yeah.

50:32.681 --> 50:33.291
- Excuses.
- Mm-hmm.

50:34.509 --> 50:36.250
- It's a school night

50:36.337 --> 50:38.165
- School?

50:38.252 --> 50:43.040
Don't you guys get, like,
time to grieve and stuff?

50:44.302 --> 50:45.520
- No.

50:46.043 --> 50:47.305
- [Sammy] They missed
enough school already.

50:47.392 --> 50:49.437
- It's one more day, Sammy.

50:49.524 --> 50:51.178
What's the difference?

50:52.397 --> 50:54.660
- Can we, please?

50:55.574 --> 50:57.097
- What a nightmare.

50:57.228 --> 50:59.969
I was trying to move a few steps
forward with these kids,

51:00.057 --> 51:01.319
and he was knocking me
10 steps back

51:01.406 --> 51:04.148
every time he opened his mouth.

51:04.235 --> 51:06.541
You guys can do marathon night
on the weekend.

51:06.628 --> 51:09.066
- How about that?
- This weekend?

51:09.153 --> 51:11.546
It's like Tuesday.
- Whatever.

51:11.633 --> 51:14.027
- But I had an Ace up my sleeve.

51:14.114 --> 51:16.247
This should definitely work.

51:19.815 --> 51:22.340
I really gotta stop drinking.

51:27.606 --> 51:30.217
All right, here we are.

51:30.304 --> 51:32.306
- You guys all set?
- Yeah.

51:32.393 --> 51:34.003
All right, I'll pick
you guys up later,

51:34.091 --> 51:35.831
and we'll go have dinner
wherever you want.

51:35.918 --> 51:37.355
- Okay.
- Okay.

51:37.442 --> 51:38.443
- Bye, Sammy.

51:38.530 --> 51:39.444
- Bye, Audrey.

51:44.013 --> 51:45.406
- You know, next time
you take us to school,

51:45.493 --> 51:48.105
how about you drop us off
on time?

51:48.192 --> 51:49.845
- [Sammy] Sorry.
- It's okay.

51:52.152 --> 51:55.677
[cellphone buzzing]
- Yo.

51:55.764 --> 51:57.375
- I've been calling you
for two days,

51:57.462 --> 51:58.767
and this is how you answer, eh?

51:58.854 --> 52:01.118
- I'm sorry. I'm just
so busy with these girls.

52:01.205 --> 52:02.684
- No, no, I understand
that, son, all right?

52:02.771 --> 52:05.252
But this is important,
all right?

52:05.339 --> 52:07.863
We need to talk.
- About what?

52:07.950 --> 52:10.039
- Something big, Sammy.

52:10.997 --> 52:11.780
- Okay.

52:13.304 --> 52:15.088
All right, give me like
30 minutes.

52:16.045 --> 52:19.048
[sighs]

52:25.142 --> 52:26.578
- [Harvey] Hey.
- Hey.

52:30.886 --> 52:31.974
How you doing?

52:34.151 --> 52:36.370
You got me rushing over here.

52:41.114 --> 52:44.900
- You know how you make
the perfect cup of tea?

52:44.987 --> 52:46.641
- [Sammy] What?

52:46.728 --> 52:48.121
- Timing.

52:50.993 --> 52:52.212
Go ahead and open it.

52:52.299 --> 52:53.909
- What is it?

52:53.996 --> 52:55.694
- [Harvey] You'll see.

52:58.262 --> 53:00.307
Omar Al Said.

53:00.394 --> 53:02.048
- I don't know who that is.

53:02.266 --> 53:03.528
- You're not supposed to know
who he is.

53:03.615 --> 53:05.312
What you need to know
is what he has

53:05.399 --> 53:07.358
hanging on his walls.

53:09.142 --> 53:11.013
That piece sold to
an anonymous buyer last year

53:11.100 --> 53:13.538
for a little over $50 mil,
all right?

53:13.625 --> 53:16.628
The art world is crawling
with rich lunatics,

53:16.715 --> 53:18.978
and I got one ready
to take that off our hands

53:19.065 --> 53:20.632
once it is in our hands.

53:20.719 --> 53:23.852
- $50 million.
What's our take?

53:23.939 --> 53:29.293
- I haven't figured it all out
yet, but it's gonna be big.

53:29.380 --> 53:32.339
- I'm sure a guy like that has
a lot of security with him.

53:32.426 --> 53:33.993
- Mm. Well, stake it out,
all right?

53:34.080 --> 53:35.995
See what your balls say.

53:36.082 --> 53:37.562
There's always a way
around them, you know?

53:37.649 --> 53:38.998
Always is.

53:39.216 --> 53:42.393
- I hated to admit it,
but the old man was right.

53:42.480 --> 53:45.004
This could be the job
to end all jobs.

53:45.091 --> 53:47.354
The take could be $5 million
easy,

53:47.441 --> 53:49.965
but bigger paydays
come with bigger risks.

53:52.403 --> 53:53.708
- Oh, it's terrible.

53:53.795 --> 53:57.582
- Yeah, of course.
You waited too long, huh?

53:58.974 --> 54:00.933
You now, your mother got me
into tea.

54:01.020 --> 54:03.718
I was a pure coffee guy
when we met.

54:03.805 --> 54:05.720
Black, no fucking around.

54:07.853 --> 54:10.551
Yeah, she changed me
in many ways,

54:10.638 --> 54:12.945
and some things
she couldn't change.

54:13.032 --> 54:14.425
- Pop, let me ask you,

54:14.512 --> 54:16.601
how did you ever tell her
about the business?

54:16.731 --> 54:18.994
- I didn't. She found out.

54:19.081 --> 54:20.953
- Wait, I thought you told her.
That's why she left.

54:21.040 --> 54:22.302
- No, she found out.

54:22.389 --> 54:24.870
She was more hurt
that I didn't tell her

54:24.957 --> 54:29.309
what I was doing than
she was about what I was doing.

54:29.396 --> 54:30.832
You know, Sammy, once trust
goes out the door,

54:30.919 --> 54:33.487
everything else follows.

54:33.574 --> 54:34.880
- You never thought about
walking away?

54:34.967 --> 54:36.621
- Oh, no.

54:36.708 --> 54:38.144
This is all I know.

54:39.667 --> 54:42.627
I never wanted you
to be part of this life,

54:42.714 --> 54:46.239
but I didn't want to
hide it from you either,

54:46.326 --> 54:49.460
and now this is all you know.

54:52.158 --> 54:54.900
But you know you have
a choice to make now, son.

54:57.598 --> 54:58.991
- I think I know.

55:01.341 --> 55:03.952
This looks great, Dad.

55:04.039 --> 55:07.304
- This, we pull off...

55:07.391 --> 55:09.001
you don't have to worry.

55:09.088 --> 55:12.352
We take care of those kids,
take care of Ira,

55:12.439 --> 55:14.615
have the life you want.

55:15.355 --> 55:18.315
- That's exactly what
I've been looking for.

55:18.402 --> 55:22.362
I appreciate it, Pop. You always
look out for me, you really do.

55:22.449 --> 55:23.842
Love you, Pop. Bye.

55:23.929 --> 55:25.626
I'll take a look at this,
and I'll call you.

55:25.713 --> 55:28.586
[dramatic music]

55:34.331 --> 55:39.074
[car engine roaring]
[dramatic music]

55:50.477 --> 55:53.306
A gate is usually a good sign.

55:53.393 --> 55:55.830
It means big house
with big money,

55:55.917 --> 55:58.224
but it also means big trouble.

56:00.661 --> 56:02.315
Getting on the other side
of that gate,

56:02.402 --> 56:03.838
it's gonna be
a fucking nightmare.

56:03.925 --> 56:06.319
[dramatic music]

56:06.406 --> 56:08.234
Hello?
- [Principal] Mr. Silverman.

56:08.321 --> 56:10.149
- What?

56:10.236 --> 56:11.977
- [Principal] I need you to
come to the school right now.

56:12.064 --> 56:12.934
- Okay, I'm coming.

56:13.021 --> 56:16.329
[dramatic music]

56:16.416 --> 56:21.160
[car engine roaring]
[dramatic music]

56:22.988 --> 56:25.599
[dramatic music]

56:30.648 --> 56:31.605
- Follow me.

56:31.692 --> 56:34.303
[dramatic music]

56:37.742 --> 56:39.004
- What exactly did she do?

56:39.091 --> 56:40.658
- She vandalized
school property.

56:40.745 --> 56:42.834
She broke into
the gym's equipment locker

56:42.921 --> 56:46.881
and then punctured every single
one of the school's basketballs

56:46.968 --> 56:48.274
with this.

56:48.361 --> 56:51.016
Is this from your home,
Mr. Silverman?

56:51.103 --> 56:53.061
- Yeah, that's mine.

56:53.366 --> 56:56.151
- Normally, I would push
for immediate suspension

56:56.238 --> 56:57.849
or even expulsion,

56:57.936 --> 57:00.678
but considering
the recent tragic circumstances

57:00.765 --> 57:01.940
and the fact that, Rachel,

57:02.027 --> 57:04.246
you've always been
a fine student,

57:04.333 --> 57:06.335
I'm gonna show
some leniency here.

57:06.423 --> 57:08.294
- Thank you.

57:08.381 --> 57:10.775
- You'll be getting
a bill for all the damages.

57:10.862 --> 57:12.472
It'll do some good for Rachel
to stay home

57:12.559 --> 57:16.041
for a couple more days,
and her sister, too.

57:17.042 --> 57:18.739
- What does Audrey
have to do with this?

57:18.826 --> 57:21.481
- They're hurting.
They need to stay home.

57:21.568 --> 57:23.918
They need to take this all in.

57:24.049 --> 57:26.268
- I know she knows better
than this,

57:26.355 --> 57:29.054
but, um, just send me the bill,

57:29.141 --> 57:31.926
and I'll take care of it,
and I really appreciate it.

57:33.841 --> 57:35.887
- Can we please go home now?

57:35.974 --> 57:36.757
- Yeah.

57:39.107 --> 57:41.936
Thank you. I'm sorry.

57:42.023 --> 57:43.677
It won't happen again.

57:48.595 --> 57:50.945
Rach, why the basketballs?

57:52.338 --> 57:55.254
- Yeah, why did you do that?
I thought you loved basketball.

57:55.341 --> 57:57.212
- She does?
- Yeah.

57:57.299 --> 57:59.954
- You do?
- Not anymore.

58:00.041 --> 58:01.434
- You know how much trouble
you're in?

58:01.521 --> 58:03.610
You know how much money
this is gonna cost me?

58:03.697 --> 58:06.178
Do you have any idea how much
money it's gonna cost me?

58:06.265 --> 58:07.527
- I honestly don't care.

58:23.325 --> 58:24.065
[door slams]

58:31.116 --> 58:32.552
- Straight to your room.

58:38.558 --> 58:41.430
[ice cube clunking]

58:46.610 --> 58:47.393
Rob!

58:49.830 --> 58:52.485
The thing about ex junkies
is a nine out of 10,

58:52.572 --> 58:55.053
their old habits never die.

58:55.140 --> 58:55.923
Rob?

58:58.186 --> 59:00.537
It's just a matter of
opportunity and a matter of time

59:00.624 --> 59:03.583
before history
starts repeating itself.

59:14.986 --> 59:16.988
Hey, put your feet down.

59:19.773 --> 59:21.209
What are you doing?

59:22.428 --> 59:24.561
- Just, uh, I'm just regrouping.

59:27.172 --> 59:28.695
- You high?

59:31.480 --> 59:33.352
Are you high?

59:33.439 --> 59:36.007
- [exhaling]

59:36.094 --> 59:37.574
I think I'm sunstroke.

59:37.661 --> 59:39.053
I've been out here for hours.

59:39.140 --> 59:41.578
- Sunstroke?
- Yeah.

59:41.665 --> 59:44.058
- Maybe it's your allergies,
huh?

59:44.145 --> 59:47.279
- Yeah, I mean,
these trees, the flowers,

59:47.366 --> 59:50.587
the pollens in the pool.
You know?

59:51.109 --> 59:53.067
Could be it.

59:53.154 --> 59:55.374
- CPS shows up, and they see
you high as a fucking kite,

59:55.461 --> 59:57.506
what do you think
they're gonna do?

59:57.594 --> 59:59.030
The only reason these girls
get to live here

59:59.117 --> 1:00:00.771
is because you're here.

1:00:00.858 --> 1:00:02.599
What are you thinking?

1:00:05.123 --> 1:00:06.733
- I didn't take that much.

1:00:06.820 --> 1:00:08.953
- You didn't take much.

1:00:09.040 --> 1:00:12.696
Well, I'm sorry
I'm overreacting here.

1:00:12.783 --> 1:00:14.523
You want these girls
to see you like this?

1:00:14.611 --> 1:00:16.482
Cool Uncle Rob?

1:00:16.569 --> 1:00:18.310
High as a fucking kite?

1:00:20.181 --> 1:00:22.270
I don't want drugs
in this house, do you hear me?

1:00:22.357 --> 1:00:24.098
I'm gonna fucking fix up
your nose and your pocket

1:00:24.185 --> 1:00:25.534
and the living room.

1:00:25.839 --> 1:00:27.841
This is a no drug zone.
You can't follow those rules,

1:00:27.928 --> 1:00:30.104
you need to get the fuck out.

1:00:32.063 --> 1:00:32.803
Wake up.

1:00:35.849 --> 1:00:37.242
Rachel!

1:00:43.161 --> 1:00:45.598
- [Audrey] Good night.
- [Rachel] Good night.

1:00:45.685 --> 1:00:47.382
Are we going to the movies
tomorrow like you promised?

1:00:47.469 --> 1:00:49.515
- [Sammy] Yeah, yeah,
I swear, tomorrow.

1:00:49.602 --> 1:00:51.430
- [Rachel] Promise?
- [Sammy] I promise.

1:00:51.517 --> 1:00:53.084
- [Rachel] Okay.
- [Sammy] We'll do it tomorrow.

1:00:53.171 --> 1:00:54.781
- [Audrey] All right.
- [Rachel] Good night.

1:00:54.868 --> 1:00:56.217
- [Sammy] Goodnight.
- [Rachel] Good night.

1:01:14.018 --> 1:01:15.236
- It's all gone.

1:01:16.455 --> 1:01:17.282
I'm off it.

1:01:18.892 --> 1:01:20.720
- Mazel Tov.

1:01:24.071 --> 1:01:27.379
- You know, alcohol is a pretty
big vice, just saying.

1:01:29.860 --> 1:01:31.600
- It's better than crack.

1:01:31.688 --> 1:01:33.864
- Yeah, it's not crack.

1:01:33.951 --> 1:01:35.169
Mind if I...

1:01:36.518 --> 1:01:38.129
- Knock yourself out.

1:01:39.434 --> 1:01:40.697
- Just a little.

1:01:44.178 --> 1:01:45.789
[alcohol pouring]

1:01:51.969 --> 1:01:55.276
Ooh. God,
I think I'll stick to crack.

1:01:55.363 --> 1:01:57.626
[chuckles]

1:01:58.627 --> 1:02:01.587
You know, my sister always knew
what to say.

1:02:01.674 --> 1:02:05.243
She always knew what to do
to get me off that shit.

1:02:05.330 --> 1:02:11.205
With just a few words,
I'd be off it, cold turkey.

1:02:13.294 --> 1:02:18.473
Till I wasn't, of course,
but she never gave up on me.

1:02:18.560 --> 1:02:20.606
She always stood by me,

1:02:20.693 --> 1:02:24.262
and she'd say a few things
and I'd be off of it again.

1:02:25.742 --> 1:02:28.005
- Your sister was tired, Rob.

1:02:29.397 --> 1:02:31.008
- Yeah, I know.

1:02:31.095 --> 1:02:32.357
- I mean...

1:02:34.011 --> 1:02:36.491
She tried everything.
You always came back.

1:02:36.578 --> 1:02:38.189
You always went back.

1:02:39.712 --> 1:02:42.149
- She was stronger than
all of us, right?

1:02:43.629 --> 1:02:44.369
- Yeah.

1:02:46.066 --> 1:02:48.025
Yes, she was.

1:02:49.635 --> 1:02:50.462
- To Laura.

1:02:54.379 --> 1:02:55.249
[clink]

1:02:58.470 --> 1:03:01.560
[inhales, exhales]

1:03:04.215 --> 1:03:05.956
I fucking miss her, man.

1:03:12.701 --> 1:03:14.312
- Me too.

1:03:21.754 --> 1:03:23.364
Those girls miss her.

1:03:25.105 --> 1:03:26.846
- [Rob] Yeah, but you're
doing a good job with them.

1:03:26.933 --> 1:03:27.934
You really are.

1:03:28.021 --> 1:03:30.676
[dramatic music]

1:03:31.764 --> 1:03:32.721
- I'm trying.

1:03:32.809 --> 1:03:35.463
[dramatic music]

1:03:38.249 --> 1:03:42.993
[car engine roaring]
[dramatic music]

1:03:52.785 --> 1:03:54.134
After very little thought,

1:03:54.221 --> 1:03:57.268
I decided to take
the painting job.

1:03:57.355 --> 1:03:58.747
"Decided" was an understatement.

1:03:58.835 --> 1:04:01.533
[dramatic music]

1:04:01.620 --> 1:04:03.665
[camera shutters]

1:04:03.752 --> 1:04:06.668
[dramatic music]

1:04:07.669 --> 1:04:10.063
- [Richie] How many you see?
- Two.

1:04:11.978 --> 1:04:12.892
- Look again.

1:04:12.979 --> 1:04:15.634
[dramatic music]

1:04:20.378 --> 1:04:22.032
Still?
- Yeah.

1:04:22.119 --> 1:04:23.207
- All right.

1:04:24.686 --> 1:04:26.427
It's gonna be easier
to go over the wall

1:04:26.514 --> 1:04:29.648
than go over that fence.
Just saying.

1:04:29.735 --> 1:04:31.563
- All right,
let's get outta here.

1:04:31.650 --> 1:04:33.608
I brought the genius
with me for the first stakeout

1:04:33.695 --> 1:04:36.263
and quickly realized that
if this was gonna work,

1:04:36.350 --> 1:04:39.049
I was gonna need a proper crew.

1:04:40.180 --> 1:04:42.139
Harvey hooked me up with lunch
and a lead.

1:04:42.226 --> 1:04:44.924
- There's David Dallas
from Milwaukee.

1:04:45.011 --> 1:04:46.491
He's in town for
a little business,

1:04:46.578 --> 1:04:49.407
but he's always up for
a little something on the side.

1:04:49.494 --> 1:04:51.278
- [Sammy] David Dallas.
You wouldn't know it

1:04:51.365 --> 1:04:53.977
by looking at this guy,
but Dallas was military,

1:04:54.064 --> 1:04:55.587
trained killer.

1:04:55.674 --> 1:04:57.241
If anyone can help us
with our security problems,

1:04:57.328 --> 1:04:58.372
it was Dallas.

1:04:58.459 --> 1:05:01.680
- Excusez-moi, mademoiselle.

1:05:01.767 --> 1:05:06.337
When you have a moment, no rush,
I would like another espresso.

1:05:06.424 --> 1:05:07.991
Merci.

1:05:08.078 --> 1:05:10.167
- [Sammy]
Great guy, amazing manners,

1:05:10.254 --> 1:05:11.995
but if you were
on his shit list,

1:05:12.082 --> 1:05:13.648
his sweet disposition
went out the window.

1:05:13.735 --> 1:05:16.608
[dramatic music]

1:05:16.695 --> 1:05:18.044
With all fairness, if Dallas
showed up at your door

1:05:18.131 --> 1:05:20.177
unannounced, you had it coming.

1:05:20.264 --> 1:05:22.309
[dramatic music]

1:05:22.396 --> 1:05:25.008
- No, you don't need a big crew,

1:05:25.095 --> 1:05:26.748
'cause you've got Dallas
taking care of security,

1:05:26.835 --> 1:05:30.143
Richie is keeping
the car running,

1:05:30.230 --> 1:05:32.276
and you need one more thing.

1:05:32.363 --> 1:05:34.147
- What's that?

1:05:34.234 --> 1:05:35.627
- A decoy.

1:05:35.714 --> 1:05:38.282
- [Sammy] Ruby Ellis.
A working girl.

1:05:38.369 --> 1:05:39.370
- 30 minutes--

1:05:39.631 --> 1:05:41.198
- [Sammy] And our mark's
favorite flavor.

1:05:41.285 --> 1:05:43.417
Ruby was our decoy.

1:05:43.504 --> 1:05:44.941
Ruby was gonna get Omar out
of the house

1:05:45.028 --> 1:05:47.813
and give us enough time
to make the grab.

1:05:47.900 --> 1:05:50.947
The only thing is she
wanted a fee and a cut,

1:05:51.034 --> 1:05:52.992
and she wanted
that fee upfront.

1:05:53.079 --> 1:05:55.473
I hate that place. Come on.

1:05:55.560 --> 1:05:56.430
[knock on door]

1:05:56.517 --> 1:05:58.258
- Speak of the devil.

1:05:58.345 --> 1:05:59.564
Come in.

1:05:59.651 --> 1:06:01.740
[dramatic music]

1:06:01.827 --> 1:06:02.654
- Hi, Daddy.

1:06:03.568 --> 1:06:05.787
[sighs]

1:06:05.874 --> 1:06:08.965
- [chuckles]
You want something to eat?

1:06:09.661 --> 1:06:11.097
- I'm good.

1:06:11.184 --> 1:06:13.012
- [Harvey] You sure?

1:06:13.099 --> 1:06:14.187
- You know what I like.

1:06:14.274 --> 1:06:16.059
- Al Said has a classic weakness

1:06:16.146 --> 1:06:18.191
and one
that we can fully exploit.

1:06:18.278 --> 1:06:20.541
She's gonna keep Omar
very busy, okay?

1:06:20.628 --> 1:06:23.240
So we'll have enough time
to make the grab.

1:06:23.327 --> 1:06:25.459
- But you think
he'll be up for a date?

1:06:25.546 --> 1:06:28.027
- Oh, yes. Omar? [laughs]

1:06:29.333 --> 1:06:31.248
He's always up for me.

1:06:31.335 --> 1:06:33.902
[Sammy and Harvey giggles]

1:06:33.990 --> 1:06:35.687
- I like her.
- Right?

1:06:35.774 --> 1:06:36.905
- How much?

1:06:36.993 --> 1:06:39.212
- Small fee and small cut.

1:06:39.299 --> 1:06:41.519
- Upfront, right?

1:06:41.606 --> 1:06:43.303
- Always.

1:06:43.390 --> 1:06:45.436
- The America dream.

1:06:45.523 --> 1:06:48.134
[dramatic music]

1:06:51.572 --> 1:06:53.357
Sounds about right.

1:06:53.444 --> 1:06:56.577
Well, it was so nice
to meet you, Sammy.

1:06:56.664 --> 1:06:58.536
- Nice to meet you.
- [Ruby] See you later, Daddy.

1:06:58.623 --> 1:07:00.146
- [Harvey] All right, baby,
take care.

1:07:00.233 --> 1:07:01.452
- I felt like I was getting
five different diseases

1:07:01.539 --> 1:07:03.410
just sitting there.

1:07:04.368 --> 1:07:07.936
[dramatic music]

1:07:08.024 --> 1:07:09.895
Now I had a crew and a timeline,

1:07:09.982 --> 1:07:11.636
and all I needed
was a babysitter.

1:07:11.723 --> 1:07:14.378
[dramatic music]

1:07:16.684 --> 1:07:18.034
Where's your uncle?

1:07:18.121 --> 1:07:19.339
- Outside.

1:07:19.426 --> 1:07:20.949
- What are you guys doing?

1:07:21.037 --> 1:07:23.343
- What does it look like?

1:07:23.517 --> 1:07:25.563
- You don't have to be so mean.
- He's annoying.

1:07:28.740 --> 1:07:30.916
- Hey.
- Hey.

1:07:35.834 --> 1:07:36.835
- Look at me.

1:07:38.880 --> 1:07:40.839
- I'm clean as a whistle.

1:07:40.926 --> 1:07:41.970
I promise.

1:07:42.058 --> 1:07:44.364
- Serious?
- Yeah.

1:07:44.451 --> 1:07:46.279
My head feels like it got
cracked open like a coconut,

1:07:46.366 --> 1:07:48.064
but I'm good.

1:07:49.108 --> 1:07:51.458
It's O.J.

1:07:51.545 --> 1:07:53.634
Straight up,
just the way I like it.

1:07:53.721 --> 1:07:56.115
- It is O.J. Proud of you.

1:07:56.202 --> 1:07:59.162
- Yeah, well,
I'm not doing it for you.

1:08:00.554 --> 1:08:02.034
I'm doing it for those girls
in there.

1:08:02.121 --> 1:08:07.039
- I know. That's what
I wanna talk to you about.

1:08:07.126 --> 1:08:08.736
- What's up?

1:08:08.823 --> 1:08:10.651
- I got this job I gotta do.

1:08:10.738 --> 1:08:12.523
- You got this job you gotta do.

1:08:12.610 --> 1:08:14.960
- And I wanna make sure you can
take care of the girls for me.

1:08:15.047 --> 1:08:16.917
- Do you really feel good
about leaving those girls

1:08:17.005 --> 1:08:18.310
with their degenerate uncle?

1:08:18.398 --> 1:08:19.921
- No.

1:08:20.095 --> 1:08:21.749
- When you put it like that,
no.

1:08:21.835 --> 1:08:23.621
- No, I'm serious.
Yes or no?

1:08:23.708 --> 1:08:25.797
- Yes, I can do it.

1:08:25.884 --> 1:08:27.059
- [cellphone buzzing]
- Beautiful, thank you.

1:08:27.146 --> 1:08:28.930
Hold on.

1:08:29.017 --> 1:08:30.758
Hello.

1:08:30.844 --> 1:08:31.889
Yeah.

1:08:33.370 --> 1:08:35.675
Okay, I'll be there
in 30 minutes.

1:08:35.763 --> 1:08:37.635
- Duty calls?

1:08:37.721 --> 1:08:39.376
- You're a real asshole
when you're sober,

1:08:39.462 --> 1:08:41.508
but I'm proud of you.
Give me one.

1:08:41.594 --> 1:08:43.162
- [Rob] Thanks.

1:08:43.249 --> 1:08:47.210
- Thank you. I'll let you
know exactly what day.

1:08:47.297 --> 1:08:48.341
Keep it up.

1:08:48.602 --> 1:08:50.474
Rob didn't know exactly
what I did,

1:08:50.560 --> 1:08:52.171
but he definitely knew
I was in the shade,

1:08:52.258 --> 1:08:54.521
but as long as he didn't
ask any tough questions,

1:08:54.608 --> 1:08:56.958
I didn't have to come up
with some tough answers.

1:08:57.045 --> 1:08:58.743
Audrey, I gotta run
for a little bit,

1:08:58.830 --> 1:09:00.353
can you do me a favor
and hold down the court?

1:09:00.440 --> 1:09:02.964
- Yeah, sure.
- Wait, are you serious?

1:09:03.139 --> 1:09:04.227
- Great, so you're the boss.

1:09:04.314 --> 1:09:06.011
- Oh, you're putting her
in charge?

1:09:06.098 --> 1:09:08.361
- What about Uncle Rob?
- Keep an eye on him too.

1:09:08.448 --> 1:09:10.885
- [Rachel] Wait,
I don't need a babysitter.

1:09:10.971 --> 1:09:13.366
- [Sammy] I think you do.

1:09:13.452 --> 1:09:15.629
- This is bullshit.
- Language.

1:09:16.542 --> 1:09:18.979
[dramatic music]

1:09:19.067 --> 1:09:20.678
- Richie.
- Yeah.

1:09:20.764 --> 1:09:22.157
- You see the street?

1:09:22.245 --> 1:09:23.246
- Yeah.

1:09:23.333 --> 1:09:25.422
- Already, you can see it
by that.

1:09:25.551 --> 1:09:27.380
There's a red barn-looking
thing.

1:09:27.467 --> 1:09:28.816
- [Sammy] Right.

1:09:28.903 --> 1:09:30.340
- All right,
that's a good spot to hide.

1:09:30.426 --> 1:09:32.690
You understand?

1:09:32.777 --> 1:09:35.300
Make sure you get all
the entrance and exits,

1:09:35.606 --> 1:09:36.520
those guys there.

1:09:36.607 --> 1:09:37.999
[camera shutter clicking]

1:09:38.085 --> 1:09:39.914
- You see any street lights?

1:09:40.001 --> 1:09:42.916
- Not right now, no.
There's none there.

1:09:44.353 --> 1:09:46.050
You know, David, go up there.

1:09:47.399 --> 1:09:49.924
Go up there with him. Show him
this and take some pictures

1:09:50.011 --> 1:09:51.665
of that, all right?
Because you have to be there.

1:09:51.752 --> 1:09:53.710
That takes about a minute and
a half, I timed it the other--

1:09:53.798 --> 1:09:55.103
- I can work with this still,
guys.

1:09:55.191 --> 1:09:56.627
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1:09:56.714 --> 1:09:58.803
- We'll take more pictures.
- It's very doable.

1:09:58.889 --> 1:10:00.413
Where are they going?

1:10:00.500 --> 1:10:02.719
- I want him to take
some pictures of there.

1:10:02.807 --> 1:10:06.811
I spoke to my guy,
I got a figure.

1:10:06.898 --> 1:10:08.073
- And?

1:10:10.902 --> 1:10:12.338
What, $5, 6 million?

1:10:12.425 --> 1:10:15.080
[dramatic music]

1:10:16.907 --> 1:10:18.300
[speaking in foreign language]

1:10:18.388 --> 1:10:19.171
$30 million?

1:10:19.258 --> 1:10:20.693
- Shh!

1:10:20.781 --> 1:10:23.001
They shouldn't hear a thing.

1:10:23.088 --> 1:10:24.481
30.

1:10:24.568 --> 1:10:26.352
- $30 million.

1:10:26.439 --> 1:10:29.137
He wasn't kidding about
keeping it between us.

1:10:29.225 --> 1:10:32.053
The others would get
a nice, decent cut,

1:10:32.139 --> 1:10:34.317
and I can pay Ira in full

1:10:34.404 --> 1:10:36.101
and still walk away
with a stupid amount.

1:10:36.188 --> 1:10:38.364
[dramatic music]

1:10:38.451 --> 1:10:43.326
- You know, it's time for
both of us to give up this life.

1:10:43.413 --> 1:10:45.545
I'm gonna throw in the towel
as well.

1:10:45.632 --> 1:10:47.808
- Throwing in the towel?
- Mm-hmm.

1:10:47.895 --> 1:10:49.027
Whatever happened
to all the speeches

1:10:49.114 --> 1:10:50.333
you used to tell me
in the office?

1:10:50.420 --> 1:10:52.422
"This is all I know.
This is my life."

1:10:52.509 --> 1:10:55.773
- I know, I know, but you know,
it's never been $30 million.

1:10:55.860 --> 1:10:57.818
You can be whoever
you want to be, right?

1:10:57.905 --> 1:11:00.995
- Absolutely.
- I'm happy for you, Pops.

1:11:01.082 --> 1:11:06.871
- You know, Sammy, when your
mother left me, I got angry.

1:11:06.958 --> 1:11:11.179
I kept busy non-stop, and then
when she got sick and died,

1:11:11.267 --> 1:11:12.572
I feel guilt.

1:11:12.659 --> 1:11:13.791
- I know.

1:11:13.878 --> 1:11:14.791
- Keep going.

1:11:14.879 --> 1:11:17.490
[dramatic music]

1:11:17.577 --> 1:11:19.536
It's time that
we don't go anymore.

1:11:19.623 --> 1:11:21.320
You understand?
Both of us.

1:11:21.538 --> 1:11:23.800
[dramatic music]

1:11:23.888 --> 1:11:24.628
All right.

1:11:26.107 --> 1:11:29.415
[camera shutter clicking]

1:11:29.502 --> 1:11:33.245
- What a fucking crock of shit.
They want more pictures?

1:11:33.332 --> 1:11:36.161
- Relax.
- Don't tell me to relax.

1:11:36.248 --> 1:11:37.467
- Well, you're not relaxing.

1:11:37.554 --> 1:11:39.556
- Yeah, something's not right,
okay?

1:11:39.643 --> 1:11:40.773
We're supposed to be crew,

1:11:40.861 --> 1:11:42.689
and they're keeping us
out of the loop.

1:11:42.776 --> 1:11:44.038
- What loop?

1:11:44.865 --> 1:11:47.607
You're the fucking driver.
What more do you need to know?

1:11:47.693 --> 1:11:51.437
Make sure there's gas in
the fucking car and relax, okay?

1:11:51.523 --> 1:11:53.396
Don't worry about
the fucking loop.

1:11:53.483 --> 1:11:56.224
Fucking loop,
what the hell is that?

1:11:56.312 --> 1:11:57.704
[camera shutter clicks]

1:11:57.791 --> 1:12:00.054
I'm gonna say it again.
- Don't you say it.

1:12:00.141 --> 1:12:02.187
- I'm fucking saying it.
- Don't you fucking say it!

1:12:02.448 --> 1:12:04.102
- Relax.
- Fuck off, come on.

1:12:04.189 --> 1:12:05.495
I'll show you relax. Let's go.

1:12:05.582 --> 1:12:07.148
- Where you going?

1:12:07.235 --> 1:12:09.237
[car door slams]
[car engine starts]

1:12:09.325 --> 1:12:10.369
Jesus Christ.

1:12:10.456 --> 1:12:13.371
[car engine roaring]

1:12:16.114 --> 1:12:18.072
Let's go around
to the other side, all right?

1:12:18.159 --> 1:12:19.509
See if we can get some shots
over there.

1:12:21.772 --> 1:12:23.251
[car door closes]

1:12:25.297 --> 1:12:27.168
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what happened? What? What?

1:12:27.255 --> 1:12:29.432
- Rachel ran away.
- What? Oh, okay, okay.

1:12:29.519 --> 1:12:31.389
Calm down. Don't worry
about it. I'm gonna find her.

1:12:31.477 --> 1:12:33.044
- I don't know what happened.
She just freaked.

1:12:33.130 --> 1:12:34.871
- She was upset.
I asked her what was going on,

1:12:34.959 --> 1:12:36.482
and she freaked out.
She just left.

1:12:36.568 --> 1:12:39.355
Don't worry about it.
Everything's gonna be fine.

1:12:39.442 --> 1:12:42.401
Oh, shit.
Audrey, you need to calm down

1:12:42.487 --> 1:12:44.316
until this woman leaves, okay?
Hi!

1:12:44.403 --> 1:12:48.451
- Hi, Mr. Silverman, did I
catch you guys at a bad time?

1:12:48.538 --> 1:12:52.324
- Uh, no, just, um, there--
there's a spider in the house.

1:12:52.411 --> 1:12:54.457
- Yeah.
- A spider?

1:12:54.544 --> 1:12:57.721
- Yeah, like a big spider.
- Huge.

1:12:58.764 --> 1:13:01.159
- I'm afraid of spiders, too.
- [Sammy] Yeah.

1:13:01.289 --> 1:13:03.291
- She hates 'em.

1:13:03.379 --> 1:13:06.120
- So how are you liking living
with your uncle and Sammy?

1:13:06.207 --> 1:13:08.993
- Um...it's been fine.

1:13:09.080 --> 1:13:12.475
- It's fine?
- Uh, fun.

1:13:12.562 --> 1:13:15.041
It's been fun, great.

1:13:15.129 --> 1:13:17.741
- Where's your sister?
- Rach is, uh...

1:13:17.827 --> 1:13:20.004
Rach was in the...
She's...

1:13:20.091 --> 1:13:22.398
- She's in the shower.
She's taking a shower right now.

1:13:22.485 --> 1:13:24.138
- Would you like to go get her
from me?

1:13:24.225 --> 1:13:25.705
I'd like to speak with her, too.

1:13:25.791 --> 1:13:29.448
- I don't know, teenage girls,
you know, with the creams

1:13:29.796 --> 1:13:31.537
and the shaving,
I don't know what

1:13:31.624 --> 1:13:33.147
she's doing in there, really.
It's gonna be a while.

1:13:33.234 --> 1:13:34.627
- Okay, well, I won't
keep you much longer.

1:13:34.714 --> 1:13:37.413
I was just checking in.
- Thank you.

1:13:37.500 --> 1:13:39.327
Uh, any news?

1:13:39.415 --> 1:13:42.068
- Not yet, but soon, I hope.
- Me too.

1:13:42.156 --> 1:13:43.853
- Okay then, have a good night.
- Thank you.

1:13:43.941 --> 1:13:45.333
- You too.
- It was good to see you.

1:13:45.421 --> 1:13:47.335
[mouths words]

1:13:47.423 --> 1:13:49.860
All right, listen, calm down.
I'm gonna go find her.

1:13:49.947 --> 1:13:51.209
Everything's gonna be fine,
okay?

1:13:51.296 --> 1:13:53.166
- [Rob] Yeah, yeah.
- All right, good save.

1:13:53.254 --> 1:13:56.432
- Thanks. Hey, uh, I think
I know where she might be.

1:13:56.693 --> 1:13:58.172
- What I'm thinking?
- [Rob] Yeah.

1:13:58.259 --> 1:14:00.000
- All right, go back in
the house. I'm gonna call you.

1:14:00.087 --> 1:14:02.089
- I got you. Let's go.
- All right.

1:14:11.272 --> 1:14:13.492
- [basketball thuds]
- [Rachel] Oh, fuck.

1:14:13.579 --> 1:14:14.493
- Hey.

1:14:17.103 --> 1:14:19.498
How come this ball
doesn't have a puncture?

1:14:19.585 --> 1:14:21.195
- Give it back.

1:14:31.467 --> 1:14:32.206
Come and take it.

1:14:36.820 --> 1:14:37.559
Come and take it.

1:14:42.173 --> 1:14:43.130
No?

1:14:50.224 --> 1:14:54.054
You know, when I was your age,
basketball saved my life.

1:14:56.796 --> 1:15:01.148
I was a bad kid, hung out
with really bad people.

1:15:01.235 --> 1:15:03.760
And basketball was the only
thing that kept me on track.

1:15:03.847 --> 1:15:06.545
[gentle guitar music]

1:15:09.940 --> 1:15:12.290
You can't run away anymore,
Rach.

1:15:15.162 --> 1:15:16.642
- This was his ball.

1:15:19.166 --> 1:15:21.517
We'd come out here
and shoot for hours.

1:15:21.603 --> 1:15:22.996
Just the two of us.

1:15:24.650 --> 1:15:27.958
It was our thing,
and I could talk to him

1:15:28.045 --> 1:15:32.309
about anything,
and he'd always listen to me.

1:15:33.659 --> 1:15:35.574
Not fake listen, you know?

1:15:37.054 --> 1:15:39.709
- I know you're hurting,

1:15:39.796 --> 1:15:41.145
and I know I'm probably
not your favorite person

1:15:41.232 --> 1:15:42.886
in the world right now,

1:15:45.715 --> 1:15:51.503
and I'll never be your dad,
but I can promise you one thing,

1:15:51.590 --> 1:15:53.070
that you don't have to go

1:15:53.157 --> 1:15:54.375
through anything alone
ever again.

1:15:54.462 --> 1:15:57.161
I'll always be here with you.

1:15:57.248 --> 1:15:58.858
If you wanna come out here
and play basketball,

1:15:58.945 --> 1:16:01.208
if that makes you feel better,
do it.

1:16:01.295 --> 1:16:03.080
If you wanna puncture every
one of those balls, go ahead.

1:16:03.166 --> 1:16:04.864
I'll even hold that ball
for you,

1:16:04.951 --> 1:16:06.952
and you do it at the house.

1:16:08.128 --> 1:16:09.565
But...

1:16:11.130 --> 1:16:13.003
You gotta come home
at some point.

1:16:13.090 --> 1:16:15.092
Your sister misses you
like crazy.

1:16:15.179 --> 1:16:16.309
She's crying.

1:16:16.397 --> 1:16:19.009
[dramatic music]

1:16:23.361 --> 1:16:25.493
- Can you show me how
to do that two shot?

1:16:25.581 --> 1:16:27.539
- Really?
- [Rachel] Yeah.

1:16:27.626 --> 1:16:28.932
- I'll show you
my favorite move.

1:16:29.019 --> 1:16:29.933
- All right, do it.

1:16:30.020 --> 1:16:32.196
- Okay!
- Let's see it.

1:16:33.501 --> 1:16:35.112
- Up the middle, bam!

1:16:35.199 --> 1:16:37.680
- [Rachel giggles]

1:16:37.767 --> 1:16:38.550
- Come here.

1:16:38.637 --> 1:16:41.291
[dramatic music]

1:16:42.815 --> 1:16:43.990
I love you.

1:16:44.077 --> 1:16:45.165
- [Rachel] I love you, too.

1:16:45.252 --> 1:16:46.732
- Hold this.
Let me get my jacket.

1:16:46.818 --> 1:16:47.690
- All right.

1:16:54.174 --> 1:16:56.175
[sighs]

1:16:56.263 --> 1:16:59.049
[dramatic music]

1:17:00.005 --> 1:17:02.226
This was it, game day.

1:17:02.313 --> 1:17:05.011
I'm not gonna lie, this was
always my favorite part.

1:17:05.098 --> 1:17:06.447
All right, guys, listen up.

1:17:06.534 --> 1:17:08.014
He's got two guys with him
all the time.

1:17:08.101 --> 1:17:10.234
A date night's
not gonna change anything.

1:17:10.321 --> 1:17:12.018
- Where is he taking you
for dinner?

1:17:12.105 --> 1:17:16.457
- Somewhere with room service,
original.

1:17:16.544 --> 1:17:18.198
- Classy.

1:17:18.285 --> 1:17:20.070
- Dinner's gonna last
longer than him, so...

1:17:20.157 --> 1:17:21.853
- All right, so there's not
gonna be a lot of time.

1:17:21.941 --> 1:17:24.117
All right? So make sure,
Ruby, that you text me

1:17:24.204 --> 1:17:26.598
the minute the fun time
is over.

1:17:26.684 --> 1:17:28.687
- You got it.
- Okay.

1:17:28.773 --> 1:17:31.255
- He's got two guys with him
at all times, like I said.

1:17:31.342 --> 1:17:34.171
One's on the inside,
one's on the outside.

1:17:34.300 --> 1:17:35.955
- And they never stray
too far from one another.

1:17:36.041 --> 1:17:38.305
So when they get close enough,
I'll take them both out.

1:17:38.478 --> 1:17:40.699
- Hey, wait, what do you
mean take out? Take out what?

1:17:40.786 --> 1:17:42.092
- Take 'em out.

1:17:42.353 --> 1:17:44.137
What did you hire me for?
Teach 'em a magic trick?

1:17:44.224 --> 1:17:47.358
- Oh, no, no. This is clean,
Dallas. I want this clean.

1:17:47.445 --> 1:17:49.142
- Yeah, no guns on this,
please.

1:17:49.228 --> 1:17:51.275
- These guys are packing heavy,
no doubt about it.

1:17:51.492 --> 1:17:53.799
- Richie, we're going light
on this.

1:17:53.886 --> 1:17:55.192
- All right, it's okay.

1:17:55.279 --> 1:17:57.324
We'll use tasers
and zip ties, then, all right?

1:17:57.411 --> 1:17:58.891
it won't be a problem.
- All right.

1:17:58.978 --> 1:18:00.632
Now, what about the guy
on the inside?

1:18:00.719 --> 1:18:02.286
- We don't have any guns.

1:18:02.373 --> 1:18:04.767
I guess we gotta go
with a ding-dong ditch.

1:18:04.853 --> 1:18:06.856
- What's that?

1:18:06.943 --> 1:18:09.075
- You know, it's the same thing
as a ring and run kind of thing.

1:18:09.162 --> 1:18:12.121
- You knock on the door.
When he answers, boom!

1:18:12.209 --> 1:18:13.818
Zip goes the weasel.

1:18:13.906 --> 1:18:16.126
- It's pop.
Pop goes the weasel.

1:18:16.213 --> 1:18:17.867
- [Harvey] Clean, perfect.

1:18:17.954 --> 1:18:22.349
- All right, cameras inside,
outside, all over the property.

1:18:22.436 --> 1:18:23.829
- What are we doing about that?

1:18:23.916 --> 1:18:26.092
- I know a guy who knows
a guy.

1:18:26.179 --> 1:18:28.007
- Of course you do.

1:18:28.094 --> 1:18:29.182
- Look, you're gonna have
30 minutes

1:18:29.269 --> 1:18:31.663
from the time the lights go out,

1:18:31.750 --> 1:18:33.099
but that's our window.

1:18:33.186 --> 1:18:35.580
So make sure you have watch
and synchronize.

1:18:35.666 --> 1:18:36.668
You understand?

1:18:36.755 --> 1:18:38.061
- All right, Richie, listen,

1:18:38.148 --> 1:18:40.150
you sit in the car,
engine running, right?

1:18:40.237 --> 1:18:42.413
Once the lights go down,
Dallas is gonna go in,

1:18:42.500 --> 1:18:43.980
knock the guards out.

1:18:44.067 --> 1:18:45.808
I come in, steal the painting,

1:18:45.895 --> 1:18:47.026
and we'll meet back
at the house.

1:18:47.157 --> 1:18:48.549
- [Harvey] Easy peasy.
- All right.

1:18:48.636 --> 1:18:51.857
- Any questions?
- Is that everything?

1:18:51.943 --> 1:18:54.380
'Cause, like, I kind of
have to go get ready.

1:18:54.686 --> 1:18:55.818
- Yeah, we should all go.

1:18:55.905 --> 1:18:59.082
- No, I got a question,
just one.

1:18:59.169 --> 1:19:02.389
So, uh, I took the time to do
a little research

1:19:02.476 --> 1:19:05.218
about these paintings,
what they might go for

1:19:06.132 --> 1:19:09.483
and, oh, fuck me, I mean,
these things are worth a lot.

1:19:09.570 --> 1:19:11.442
- So what's the question?

1:19:11.529 --> 1:19:13.443
- Oh, what I'm saying is

1:19:13.531 --> 1:19:15.620
that maybe we're being
a little shortchanged.

1:19:15.707 --> 1:19:17.404
I mean, what if
one of our paintings

1:19:17.491 --> 1:19:19.058
are worth that much, right?

1:19:19.145 --> 1:19:21.844
And if I get 5% and when I
do the math, bang, bang, bang,

1:19:21.931 --> 1:19:24.716
it just, you know,
doesn't really add up,

1:19:24.803 --> 1:19:28.938
so what I'm trying to say is you
got me on a fucking discount.

1:19:29.025 --> 1:19:31.244
- You know, Richie,
bang, bang, bang.

1:19:31.331 --> 1:19:33.769
This is no time to be
negotiating salaries, okay?

1:19:33.856 --> 1:19:35.553
You're gonna do very well,
please.

1:19:35.639 --> 1:19:38.251
- Pops, the guy is getting 5%
for sitting in a car.

1:19:38.338 --> 1:19:40.818
- For God's sakes,
I do less on my knees.

1:19:40.906 --> 1:19:45.737
- How about you, Dallas?
What do you feel about 5%, huh?

1:19:47.434 --> 1:19:49.262
- You gotta be fucking
kidding me right now.

1:19:49.349 --> 1:19:50.873
- Listen, what he's making

1:19:50.960 --> 1:19:52.309
is none of your business,
all right?

1:19:52.396 --> 1:19:53.963
He's bringing much more
to the table, Richie.

1:19:54.050 --> 1:19:56.008
You're gonna be very well
taken care of.

1:19:56.094 --> 1:19:58.010
So just calm down.

1:19:58.097 --> 1:19:59.490
- Do you need a ride, honey?

1:19:59.577 --> 1:20:01.318
- Yo, Richie,
hold on one second.

1:20:01.405 --> 1:20:03.755
We're good, right?
- Yeah, we're good, man.

1:20:03.842 --> 1:20:05.452
- We're good.
- No, no, calm down, Richie.

1:20:05.539 --> 1:20:07.411
- Calm down.
- We're good, we're good.

1:20:07.498 --> 1:20:10.457
- Dallas, are we good?
- We're good. Hey, Richie,

1:20:10.544 --> 1:20:12.633
let me catch a lift, too, huh?

1:20:12.719 --> 1:20:14.548
[dramatic music]

1:20:14.635 --> 1:20:16.898
- All right then.

1:20:16.986 --> 1:20:19.597
This son of a bitch, I should
have listened to you.

1:20:19.684 --> 1:20:23.731
- What did I tell you?
He's tearing up the whole thing.

1:20:23.818 --> 1:20:27.039
- Ah, boy, oh boy.
You were right.

1:20:27.126 --> 1:20:29.389
- I had a bad feeling now,
a bad taste in my mouth,

1:20:29.476 --> 1:20:31.261
and it wasn't tea.

1:20:31.348 --> 1:20:35.004
I kept waiting for Laura to
appear and tell me to walk away,

1:20:35.091 --> 1:20:36.440
but it wasn't just me
and my gut.

1:20:36.527 --> 1:20:39.443
[dramatic music]

1:20:39.530 --> 1:20:41.837
Getting ready for a job
always made me nervous,

1:20:41.924 --> 1:20:45.405
especially a job
I've never done before.

1:20:46.276 --> 1:20:49.018
I don't know a thing about art,
except that it's overpriced,

1:20:49.105 --> 1:20:53.109
and it's much easier to move
around when it's rolled up.

1:20:53.196 --> 1:20:54.937
I do know a few things
about robberies, though.

1:20:55.023 --> 1:20:56.329
[gun cocks]

1:20:56.416 --> 1:20:57.983
If you bring a gun,
there's a good chance

1:20:58.070 --> 1:21:00.377
you're gonna use it.

1:21:00.464 --> 1:21:02.205
[dramatic music]

1:21:15.522 --> 1:21:16.654
- That's crazy.

1:21:18.743 --> 1:21:21.789
- Hey, guys,
don't wait up for me,

1:21:21.877 --> 1:21:24.096
I gotta go do some work thing,
okay?

1:21:24.183 --> 1:21:26.664
- Where are you going?
- I got a work thing I gotta do,

1:21:26.969 --> 1:21:29.623
but, uh, the good news
is when it's done...

1:21:30.668 --> 1:21:32.278
we're gonna spend
a lot of time together.

1:21:32.365 --> 1:21:33.800
- What thing?

1:21:33.889 --> 1:21:35.760
- It's just a work thing.

1:21:35.978 --> 1:21:37.762
- Hey, can I get another beer
while you're up?

1:21:37.849 --> 1:21:41.374
- I got you.
- Sammy.

1:21:43.724 --> 1:21:46.553
Get out of here. I got this.
Don't worry about it.

1:21:49.208 --> 1:21:51.602
- I just wanted to say goodbye,
you know?

1:21:51.689 --> 1:21:53.603
- Don't you think those girls
have had enough goodbyes

1:21:53.691 --> 1:21:54.910
for a while?

1:21:56.389 --> 1:21:58.261
- [whispers]
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1:21:58.348 --> 1:22:00.437
- You can tell them
when you get back.

1:22:02.395 --> 1:22:03.875
- Okay.

1:22:03.962 --> 1:22:05.790
- Hey, uh...

1:22:07.270 --> 1:22:08.835
I wanted to thank you.

1:22:08.924 --> 1:22:10.751
- For what?

1:22:10.838 --> 1:22:12.666
- Just felt like the right thing
to say.

1:22:15.539 --> 1:22:17.106
- When you think about
something to tell me,

1:22:17.193 --> 1:22:18.759
you tell me what I'm back,
okay?

1:22:18.846 --> 1:22:20.500
- Yeah.

1:22:20.587 --> 1:22:22.023
- I love you girls.

1:22:22.111 --> 1:22:24.591
- Bye. Love you.
- Bye.

1:22:24.809 --> 1:22:25.984
- Take care of them for me,
okay?

1:22:26.071 --> 1:22:27.681
- I got you.

1:22:27.768 --> 1:22:29.945
- Take care of them.

1:22:32.077 --> 1:22:34.950
[TV playing indistinctly]

1:22:37.952 --> 1:22:39.302
[bottle cap clatters]

1:22:39.389 --> 1:22:42.261
- Let's go!
- [Rachel giggles]

1:22:42.348 --> 1:22:44.568

1:23:00.714 --> 1:23:03.674
[radio static and chatter]

1:23:03.761 --> 1:23:08.418
[engine idling]

1:23:09.593 --> 1:23:14.206
[dramatic music]

1:23:27.045 --> 1:23:30.005
[car engine roars, turns off]

1:23:30.092 --> 1:23:32.616
[dramatic music]

1:23:35.923 --> 1:23:37.621
- Yeah, Harvey, I'm here.

1:23:37.708 --> 1:23:38.535
- [Harvey] All right, good.

1:23:38.621 --> 1:23:41.755
[dramatic music]

1:23:48.458 --> 1:23:50.199
-[rustle in distance]
- Did you hear that?

1:23:50.286 --> 1:23:51.200
- I didn't hear anything.

1:23:51.287 --> 1:23:54.725
[dramatic music]

1:23:54.812 --> 1:23:56.379
- Check the back.
- All right.

1:23:56.466 --> 1:23:59.077
[dramatic music]

1:24:19.271 --> 1:24:20.707
- [Security] It's probably
just the circuit breaker again.

1:24:20.794 --> 1:24:22.144
I'm gonna go check it out.
Over.

1:24:22.231 --> 1:24:24.885
[dramatic music]

1:24:52.565 --> 1:24:54.089
[taser buzzing]

1:24:54.175 --> 1:24:56.091

1:25:01.008 --> 1:25:05.621
[cellphone buzzing]

1:25:05.709 --> 1:25:07.058
- Ruby, what's up?

1:25:07.145 --> 1:25:09.800
It's over, Papi.
- [Harvey] What?

1:25:09.887 --> 1:25:13.195
- I mean, over, done,
he couldn't get it up.

1:25:13.282 --> 1:25:15.022
- When?
- I don't know,

1:25:15.110 --> 1:25:17.895
like 10 minutes ago
or something, maybe.

1:25:17.982 --> 1:25:19.201
10 minutes ago?
You should've--

1:25:19.288 --> 1:25:21.290
You should've texted.
Why didn't you text?

1:25:21.377 --> 1:25:25.076
I ain't your fucking secretary.
The fuck? I did my job.

1:25:25.163 --> 1:25:27.034
- Dammit.

1:25:27.121 --> 1:25:29.472
[dramatic music]

1:25:34.085 --> 1:25:37.567
[lock clicks, door squeaking]

1:25:37.654 --> 1:25:40.526
[dramatic music]

1:25:48.317 --> 1:25:50.623
- [cellphone buzzes]
- Yeah.

1:25:50.710 --> 1:25:53.017
- Richie, the mark
is on his way.

1:25:53.103 --> 1:25:54.584
How long I got?

1:25:54.671 --> 1:25:56.107
- Five minutes tops.

1:25:56.193 --> 1:25:58.065
- All right, no, I'm on it,
I'm on it, I'm on it.

1:25:58.153 --> 1:26:00.416
[dramatic music]

1:26:54.557 --> 1:26:56.950
- [whispers] Hey, hey. Shh, shh.
It's okay.

1:26:57.037 --> 1:27:00.258
Shh, come, quiet.

1:27:00.344 --> 1:27:02.391
Shh, don't scream, don't scream.

1:27:04.130 --> 1:27:05.742
What are you doing here?
You're scaring the kid.

1:27:05.829 --> 1:27:07.047
Put the gun away.

1:27:07.134 --> 1:27:10.137
- No, no, the only thing
scaring this kid

1:27:10.225 --> 1:27:12.705
is the two scary men
in the living room.

1:27:12.791 --> 1:27:14.664
Three scary men.

1:27:14.751 --> 1:27:16.492
- Dallas, talk some sense
into him.

1:27:16.579 --> 1:27:17.884
He's got a gun with him.

1:27:17.971 --> 1:27:20.191
- I think he's making
perfect sense, Sammy.

1:27:20.278 --> 1:27:23.803
- That's right. Now his father's
gonna be here any minute,

1:27:23.889 --> 1:27:25.892
and we were gonna do this
the hard way, right?

1:27:25.978 --> 1:27:28.634
But I think Omar will
give us anything we want

1:27:28.721 --> 1:27:30.767
in exchange for junior
over here.

1:27:30.853 --> 1:27:33.813
- What are you guys doing?
Why are you doing this?

1:27:33.900 --> 1:27:36.555
Listen to me very carefully.

1:27:36.642 --> 1:27:38.469
I'm gonna take this painting.

1:27:38.557 --> 1:27:41.038
I'm gonna go home,
and I'll meet you there.

1:27:41.125 --> 1:27:43.910
- [Richie] Just like we said,
just like we said.

1:27:43.996 --> 1:27:48.698
- We're taking all the paintings
and we're taking the kid too.

1:27:48.785 --> 1:27:51.483
- That's right, we're emptying
Omar's whole fucking place,

1:27:51.570 --> 1:27:52.702
then you and your dad
could go home

1:27:52.789 --> 1:27:55.094
and have
your fucking circle jerk.

1:27:55.182 --> 1:27:57.924
- Okay. Okay.

1:27:58.011 --> 1:28:01.493
Don't hurt the kid, okay?

1:28:01.580 --> 1:28:04.975
- We're not gonna hurt the kid
Sammy. We're not animals.

1:28:05.062 --> 1:28:08.108
This isn't personal.
What can I say?

1:28:08.195 --> 1:28:08.934
Money talks.

1:28:09.022 --> 1:28:10.546
[gunshot]

1:28:11.938 --> 1:28:14.550
[gunshots]

1:28:14.637 --> 1:28:16.594
- [thud]
- Pop!

1:28:16.682 --> 1:28:21.339
- Yeah, Sammy, the painting.

1:28:21.425 --> 1:28:22.775
- Okay.

1:28:22.862 --> 1:28:23.950
[dramatic music]

1:28:24.037 --> 1:28:26.039
- Come on, hurry!

1:28:26.126 --> 1:28:28.999
[dramatic music]

1:28:31.349 --> 1:28:32.871
- Mama.

Dad, stop them!

1:28:43.448 --> 1:28:45.145
[child screams]

1:28:45.232 --> 1:28:46.799
- What's wrong?
- [child screams]

1:28:46.886 --> 1:28:48.018
- Baby, talk to me.
What's wrong?

1:28:48.105 --> 1:28:49.367
- [child crying]

1:28:49.454 --> 1:28:51.413
- What's wrong?
Is somebody inside?

1:28:51.500 --> 1:28:55.678
- [child screaming]
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1:28:55.764 --> 1:28:57.593
- All right,
you got the painting?

1:28:57.680 --> 1:28:59.464
- I've got the painting.
I got the painting.

1:28:59.594 --> 1:29:02.728
- [child] No!
- Wait right here.

1:29:02.815 --> 1:29:03.990
Wait here for one second.

1:29:04.077 --> 1:29:08.343
[dramatic music]

1:29:08.430 --> 1:29:10.910
- Go. Drive, drive.
- [car engine starts]

1:29:16.568 --> 1:29:18.222
[dramatic music]

1:29:18.309 --> 1:29:20.616
- What the fuck?
