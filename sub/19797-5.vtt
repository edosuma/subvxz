Just a normal day, innit? So... What? What are you laughing at?

00:42.267 --> 00:47.334
Yeah, mate, it's obviously Red Nose Day. It's always a good laugh.

That's the sort of thing, hopping everywhere, that's what we'll be doing today.

01:07.334 --> 01:09.868
We always do that, always a good laugh. We raise quite a lot

01:09.934 --> 01:13.667
last time, didn't we? Honestly, it is comic relief.

01:13.734 --> 01:18.000
We're raising money for people who are starving to death.

01:38.701 --> 01:40.567
About five-ish.

-So they'll love us. -No, I think it's just me. I've got some plans.

01:42.167 --> 01:43.500
We can all be in it then.

01:43.567 --> 01:45.367

Or the ladies, if there are any ladies that like that sort of... I don't think there are

02:09.367 --> 02:11.300
any in this office and if there are,

02:11.367 --> 02:14.000
good luck to them. They're all welcome, we're all equal, now.

02:28.901 --> 02:32.868
-Here he goes. -Kisses for a quid. That's a good cause there.

Not true. A lot of it stays in this country,

Well, we're all ears, Gareth.

05:27.300 --> 05:31.500

05:31.567 --> 05:35.601
set off a fire alarm, a fake fire alarm, everybody legs it out the office leaving them

-Oh, give us a job. -I've already got one reprobate, thanks very much.

13:57.734 --> 14:00.500
-Jimmy The Perv and the Oggmonster. -Oh, bloody hell!

14:00.567 --> 14:02.801
-What's the weather like up there? -Oh, I've heard that before.

14:02.868 --> 14:05.601
-Your parents put you to grove avenue, did they? -That's an old one.

14:05.667 --> 14:07.767
-"Let's grow ourselves a big, lanky, goggle-eyed freak."

14:07.834 --> 14:10.334
-Calm down mate there's no need to get offensive. -No, no, I was just...

14:10.400 --> 14:13.267
-Got a little fatter since I last saw you? -No, I was joining in...

14:13.334 --> 14:17.334
Don't have a go at the eyes, that is astigmatism I've had from the age of five,

14:17.400 --> 14:19.801
so that's what makes them a bit bulbous.

14:19.868 --> 14:22.167
-So don't just...

14:22.234 --> 14:24.367
-I can call you the "whaleman" or the "blubberman." -Yeah, but I don't go around

14:24.434 --> 14:27.334
-calling myself the mong-boy. -Well I don't either, I call myself the Oggmonster.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.000
I'm not going to call you the Oggmonster.

14:29.067 --> 14:31.868
-That's my name. -No it's not. What's your real name?

14:31.934 --> 14:33.834
That's a good name. Nathan.

14:33.901 --> 14:35.100
Is it?

14:35.167 --> 14:36.834
Yes! I'll call you Nathan.

14:36.901 --> 14:38.133
I didn't call you fatty!

14:38.200 --> 14:39.667
What is...

14:39.734 --> 14:42.133
DAVID: What is the matter with him?

14:49.133 --> 14:50.868
Yeah. (PHONE RINGING)

14:52.734 --> 14:55.434
I've got a sponsorship form for comic relief.

14:55.500 --> 14:58.167
I wanted to enter into the spirit a bit more.

14:58.234 --> 15:02.000
So, um, gents, sorry to interrupt, I wonder if you'd like to sponsor me.

15:02.067 --> 15:06.834
I have to hide as many of Gareth's possessions as I can from him

15:06.901 --> 15:07.834
for the rest of the day.

15:07.901 --> 15:09.667
You've got to do what?

15:09.734 --> 15:12.067
-I will be hiding Gareth's belongings. -(LAUGHING)

15:12.133 --> 15:14.133
-I'll give you two quid for the lot. -Two quid for the lot?

15:14.200 --> 15:16.067
That's a generous offer.

15:16.834 --> 15:19.300
They're waiting for me.

15:19.367 --> 15:21.901
Oye, break it up. Put her down. (LAUGHING)

15:21.968 --> 15:25.267
No, they wouldn't. She wouldn't. Her husband's loaded.

15:26.167 --> 15:27.567
He does okay.

15:29.467 --> 15:31.234
Oh, dear (EXHALES)

15:32.767 --> 15:34.067
What a day!

15:36.100 --> 15:38.367
Okay, David, do you have that report?

15:40.300 --> 15:41.934
Oh, glad you brought that up.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.067
That's why I'm here.

15:44.133 --> 15:49.167
-Yes, um... Formulating a lot of good ideas. -No, David,

15:49.234 --> 15:52.500
I don't want to talk about the report or the report we're gonna do soon.

15:52.567 --> 15:55.167
I'm talking about the report that we talked about four days ago

15:55.234 --> 15:57.667
that was definitely gonna be done today.

15:59.567 --> 16:02.567
You know how important I consider this report to be.

16:02.634 --> 16:07.200
I come in and I discover that this is the fruit of your labours.

16:07.267 --> 16:09.601
-You don't go through my stuff when I'm not in the room. -Three sentences.

16:09.667 --> 16:12.734
Just please read the first sentence for Jennifer.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.167
"Imagine a cross between Telly Addicts and Noel's House Party.

16:21.234 --> 16:23.234
"You just imagined Upstairs Downstairs,

16:23.300 --> 16:26.667
"a new quiz show devised and hosted by David Brent."

16:26.734 --> 16:29.167
David, I just don't understand this.

16:31.400 --> 16:35.434
-Well, contestants run upstairs and get a clue... -No, not the gameshow!

16:35.500 --> 16:38.367
I don't understand why you haven't done the report you said you'd do.

16:38.434 --> 16:41.767
I don't understand your consistent negligence and failure to do

16:41.834 --> 16:43.167
what is asked of you.

16:43.234 --> 16:44.667
Because you're viewing

16:44.734 --> 16:46.801
my methods like there's something missing,

16:46.868 --> 16:50.400
you're looking at it like the jigsaw that it is, but you're viewing

16:50.467 --> 16:54.033
it through a keyhole, when you should be...

16:54.100 --> 16:56.968
David, some words would be useful here.

16:57.033 --> 17:00.033
-I think actions speak louder than words. -You're on a warning.

17:00.100 --> 17:03.000
That's the action I'm going to take. It's a verbal warning,

17:03.067 --> 17:05.534
obviously three strikes and you're out. Things have got to change.

17:08.767 --> 17:13.801
Fine. Give me all three now then, because I'd love to see you run this place.

17:13.868 --> 17:15.868
You'd have a mutiny on your hands for a start, because they...

17:15.934 --> 17:18.200
But if that's what you want, Come on, let's bring it on.

17:18.267 --> 17:20.868
No, David, that's not what I want. I want to see this place being run

17:20.934 --> 17:22.801
-with you doing your job, okay? -Okay.

17:22.868 --> 17:24.100
Take the verbal warning...

17:24.167 --> 17:25.334
Still take the warning?

17:25.400 --> 17:27.634
Take the verbal warning, learn from it.

17:27.701 --> 17:30.400
And let's move onwards and upwards, okay?

17:33.567 --> 17:37.100
Neil makes me laugh, though, because it's his interfering.

17:37.167 --> 17:40.400
It's his timing. He's going on about him wanting some report doing.

17:40.467 --> 17:42.200
It's Red Nose Day.

17:42.267 --> 17:45.500
Oh, what's more important? You Neil, with your report,

17:45.567 --> 17:48.000
or some starving children? Oh, I dunno!

17:48.067 --> 17:50.234
What would Lenny Henry say?

17:50.300 --> 17:53.234
I think we know. Imagine him going out the door on comic relief day

17:53.300 --> 17:56.734
and Dawn French is going, "Where you going, you haven't done the washing up!

17:56.801 --> 17:58.400
"You haven't put the rubbish out."

17:58.467 --> 18:01.334
"Do it yourself. I've got to save some Africans!"

18:07.167 --> 18:08.701
What are you reading?

18:08.767 --> 18:10.200
A holiday brochure.

18:11.567 --> 18:13.834
Why is that? Going on holiday?

18:13.901 --> 18:15.167
Yes, well... Possibly.

18:15.234 --> 18:16.634
Where to?

18:16.701 --> 18:18.167
Umm... The States.

18:21.601 --> 18:22.634
United States?

18:22.701 --> 18:23.834
Um... Yeah.

18:29.801 --> 18:34.567
I dunno if you've heard the gossip but Tim's going out with Rachel.

18:35.367 --> 18:38.367
Yeah, yeah, I'd heard.

18:38.434 --> 18:40.968
Yeah, cos he used to fancy you, didn't he?

18:41.033 --> 18:42.200
Oh did he?

18:42.400 --> 18:43.534
Yeah, yeah, he did.

18:44.567 --> 18:46.767
Now he's found someone better.

18:47.567 --> 18:48.601
Yep.

18:50.834 --> 18:52.267
(HOPPING)

19:01.868 --> 19:04.100
Seen my phone? Where's my phone?

19:06.534 --> 19:09.634
Have you got it? Where have you put it?

19:09.701 --> 19:13.167
Seriously, where have you put my phone?

19:13.234 --> 19:15.334
Gareth... Don't believe it.

19:15.400 --> 19:17.767
-So many times, I've told you not to touch my stuff... -Gareth, listen to me...

19:17.834 --> 19:19.734
Phone is a different man. Excuse me...

19:19.801 --> 19:21.968
-Gareth it's for charity, okay? -What else have you taken?

19:22.033 --> 19:26.100
-Where's my tiny tanks, how am I supposed to work? -(LAUGHING)

19:26.167 --> 19:28.133
You'll have to hop to it.

19:33.033 --> 19:35.067
A lot of crime in America.

19:35.133 --> 19:37.667
Right, well, I'll be careful.

19:37.734 --> 19:39.801
Word of advice:

19:39.868 --> 19:42.801
keep your traveller's cheques in a bum-bag.

19:45.767 --> 19:47.534
Thanks, I'll buy one.

19:48.467 --> 19:49.534
When you get there?

19:49.601 --> 19:52.067
Yep.

19:52.133 --> 19:56.634
Word of warning, then. Out there, they call them fanny-packs.

19:58.801 --> 20:01.467
Cos fanny means your arse over there.

20:04.934 --> 20:07.033
Not your minge.

20:14.200 --> 20:15.500
(HOPPING)

20:17.167 --> 20:20.467
Where's...? God, you're so immature.

20:20.534 --> 20:24.000
-Where... I demand... -Gareth's stopped hopping, everyone.

20:24.067 --> 20:26.334
-How I'm supposed to do any work? -I told you, it's for charity.

20:26.400 --> 20:29.500
-It's not for charity, is it? It's for you winding me up. -Gareth's stopped hopping.

20:29.567 --> 20:32.334
I don't have... I don't have to hop all day!

20:32.400 --> 20:34.167
It's just when I'm moving, I have to hop.

20:34.234 --> 20:36.801
-Where does it say that in the rule book? -Where is my... See?

20:36.868 --> 20:41.667
GARETH: That's mine, for starts, straight away, Where's the rest of it?

20:41.734 --> 20:43.901
-Hmm? -Gareth! Gareth! Okay Gareth, just...

20:43.968 --> 20:48.334
Calm down, okay? Have a seat. You've been on your foot all day.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.567
GARETH: Oh, God, how do you hide a chair?

Dawnie, can you take that?

21:04.500 --> 21:06.133
Yes.

21:06.200 --> 21:07.567
Yeah. You? Are you all right?

21:07.634 --> 21:09.200
Hi. Hello.

21:09.267 --> 21:11.868
-There you go love, prawn and avocado. -Thank you!

21:11.934 --> 21:14.400
-See you later. -Wait, you're not going to eat it here?

21:14.467 --> 21:20.334
-No, I've gotta get back. -Oh, okay. Well, I made £19 today

21:20.400 --> 21:23.467
Any of it going to English kids or is it all going abroad, I suppose?

21:23.534 --> 21:27.868
Well, will you please... Stop moaning and give her a quid for a kiss.

21:27.934 --> 21:29.334
I'm not paying for it, mate.

21:29.400 --> 21:30.901
Them's the rules.

All right.

Oh, good. That's great.

21:52.067 --> 21:53.434
Oh... Thank you. My contribution.

21:53.500 --> 21:55.133
Huh? Where do you want your kiss?

21:55.200 --> 21:56.534
Where do you want your kiss?

21:56.601 --> 21:57.868
It's all right, I'll just...

21:57.934 --> 21:59.834
You've got to have a kiss.

I don't have to have a kiss.

I'm very, very...

22:42.567 --> 22:44.500
Very bored.

22:44.567 --> 22:49.167
Excuse me. Desk procedures. There are chairs for sitting on.

22:49.234 --> 22:52.200
I think he's a bit jealous that he's not getting the view you're getting!

22:52.267 --> 22:55.234
Wrong, I got the arse this side so...

22:55.300 --> 22:57.534
I'd only want to be sitting where he's sitting if you was wearing a skirt

22:57.601 --> 22:59.968
then I could look up there. That's it.

23:31.734 --> 23:32.868
Tomorrow?

Yes, around lunch time.

23:36.334 --> 23:37.534
Excuse me, David.

23:37.601 --> 23:39.067
DAVID: Yes.

23:39.133 --> 23:41.934
-Can we have another quick word? -Not now, no,

23:42.000 --> 23:44.334
-I'm literally running downstairs now this minute, -What for?

23:44.400 --> 23:47.834
The Gazette are coming in to take my picture. So I'm going to be in the paper.

23:47.901 --> 23:50.567
Well, Wernham Hogg are going to be in the paper, free advertising.

23:50.634 --> 23:51.767
That's not why I'm doing it.

23:51.834 --> 23:53.367
This shouldn't take long,

23:53.434 --> 23:56.801
-Okay. -Sorry to spring this on you now.

23:56.868 --> 23:59.801
Umm... We have been discussing something you said earlier and

23:59.868 --> 24:03.934
it's certainly something we've been thinking about as well. Um...

24:04.000 --> 24:07.567
We'd like to offer you a very generous redundancy package.

24:12.934 --> 24:16.901
Are you offering me it or are you telling me I've got to take it?

24:16.968 --> 24:21.000
Um...we're telling you you've got to take it.

24:21.067 --> 24:24.267
JENNIFER: We will put in a proper meeting tomorrow.

24:25.634 --> 24:30.601
It's good timing, innit, telling me that today?

24:30.667 --> 24:35.067
The day of laughter? Brilliant.

24:35.133 --> 24:36.901
Well that's that ruined, isn't it?

24:36.968 --> 24:38.701
That's what I was...

24:39.601 --> 24:40.834
That's...

24:49.500 --> 24:51.734
It's got pockets and everything.

24:53.968 --> 24:57.267
So, now I've gotta try and go down there and be funny.

24:59.067 --> 25:01.734
That's gonna be good, innit?

25:03.567 --> 25:06.133
With that going through...

25:08.667 --> 25:11.634
I knew you were up to something, planning something.

25:11.701 --> 25:14.801
Jennifer, do you agree with this? Because we can...

25:17.100 --> 25:20.267
I'll be all right, don't worry about me. I've got other irons in the fire.

25:20.334 --> 25:23.767
So it's the best thing that's ever happened to me, to be honest.

25:23.834 --> 25:27.901
But I'd love to see you turn that lot out there.

25:27.968 --> 25:31.801
You are going to have a mutiny on your hands. They will go berserk.

25:31.868 --> 25:34.234
Definitely.

25:34.300 --> 25:36.767
If that's it, can you leave now, please?

25:38.334 --> 25:41.067
Go on, I've got stuff to do. I've got...

25:41.133 --> 25:43.467
Laughter. I've got money to raise.

25:43.534 --> 25:45.400
It's your time. Mouths to feed.

25:45.467 --> 25:46.334
Yeah.

26:06.667 --> 26:10.934
If you're wondering what that meeting was just about in there?

26:12.667 --> 26:14.534
That's it.

26:14.601 --> 26:16.567
I've been made redundant.

26:20.467 --> 26:21.334
Yeah.

26:23.367 --> 26:27.567
After it was me who saved others from redundancy.

26:27.634 --> 26:29.234
Then it's back...

26:30.267 --> 26:31.968
The good die young.

26:32.901 --> 26:35.300
But, um... Oh, yes,

26:35.367 --> 26:38.400
I said you lot would go mental.

26:42.267 --> 26:44.734
Now I've got to go and give laughter.

26:47.467 --> 26:48.567
But...

26:52.000 --> 26:53.200
See you.

26:54.100 --> 26:55.100
Eh?

27:03.467 --> 27:04.801
See ya...

27:13.300 --> 27:15.534
OK, do you just wanna make it peck?

27:18.067 --> 27:20.167
Yeah. (CAMERA CLICKING)

27:20.901 --> 27:22.500
Just run around a bit?

27:25.601 --> 27:26.734
Yeah.

27:29.167 --> 27:30.234
Good.

27:33.434 --> 27:34.534
Yeah.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.667
PHOTOGRAPHER: Good.

27:39.467 --> 27:40.634
Great.

27:40.701 --> 27:42.601
And smile, it's for comic relief.

27:42.667 --> 27:44.901
-Can I just do it standing there? -Yeah, just...

27:44.968 --> 27:46.968
Can you make it peck at your mates like Roy Hudd?

27:47.033 --> 27:48.667
Just do that. Rod Hull.

27:51.133 --> 27:52.734
(CAMERA CLICKING)

27:54.868 --> 27:56.000
Good...

27:56.767 --> 27:58.133
Yeah.

27:58.200 --> 28:00.267
Okay good, that's fine. Yeah!

28:00.334 --> 28:04.767
-All right? -It's a bit dark, actually. I didn't bring a flash.

28:04.834 --> 28:07.801
Probably won't be able to use these, actually.

28:07.868 --> 28:10.834
-Okay, don't be disappointed if they're not in. -No.

28:10.901 --> 28:11.934
Thank you! Okay.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.400
Bye. Cheers.

28:15.067 --> 28:16.100
Well done, David.

28:16.167 --> 28:17.167
Yes.

28:17.234 --> 28:19.400
(HOPPING) No worries.

28:19.467 --> 28:20.901
Yeah. (PANTING) Did I miss it?

28:27.968 --> 28:31.767
# So what becomes of you, my love

28:33.701 --> 28:38.334
# When they have finally stripped you of

28:38.400 --> 28:40.734
# The handbags and the glad rags

28:40.801 --> 28:44.734
# That your granddad had to sweat so you could buy #

28:45.267 --> 28:46.434
(PHONE RINGS)

28:49.167 --> 28:50.033
Booyakasha.
