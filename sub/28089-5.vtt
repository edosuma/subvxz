00:20.000 --> 00:21.667
<i>Previously on</i> Doom Patrol...

00:21.669 --> 00:22.669
Caulder!

00:22.670 --> 00:23.803
Excuse me, sir.

00:23.836 --> 00:24.937
Name's Kipling.

00:24.971 --> 00:26.573
He is an established
Chaos Magician,

00:26.606 --> 00:29.242
which explains some of the
weird stuff we've seen so far.

00:29.275 --> 00:31.178
What's the Cult
of the Unwritten Book?

00:31.210 --> 00:32.345
Goddamn nightmare.

00:32.378 --> 00:34.381
<i>The Book is being
written as we speak.</i>

00:34.414 --> 00:37.283
<i>Once it's completed,
the Eye will be summoned.</i>

00:37.317 --> 00:39.751
<i>The Decreator.
And the world will be unmade.</i>

00:39.752 --> 00:40.719
What is that?

00:40.719 --> 00:41.655
It's a door.

00:41.656 --> 00:44.357
Close the portal.
Close the portal.

00:44.390 --> 00:46.326
We saved the kid.
What else is there?

00:46.359 --> 00:48.827
All we have to do is close
the bloody Gates to Nurnheim.

00:48.828 --> 00:50.029
What the hell is Nurnheim?

00:51.930 --> 00:53.634
Nurnheim sucks.

00:53.667 --> 00:56.268
Maybe the people
in this house can't save you.

00:56.302 --> 00:58.405
But can you at least
let us try?

00:58.438 --> 01:00.039
What the hell
are you supposed to be?

01:00.073 --> 01:03.343
We are the Archons.
The high priests of Nurnheim.

01:03.377 --> 01:05.010
You're a fucking psychopath.

01:05.045 --> 01:08.447
You're nothing more than
an organ in a container.

01:08.480 --> 01:09.515
You?

01:09.549 --> 01:11.150
Young Kay?

01:11.183 --> 01:13.715
Scared and wounded child.

01:14.721 --> 01:15.721
No, please.

01:15.722 --> 01:16.956
Elliot!

01:19.792 --> 01:22.042
We're too late.

02:42.375 --> 02:45.578
Fuck you, bastard!

02:45.610 --> 02:47.080
What the fuck?

03:12.171 --> 03:13.639
Shit!

03:13.674 --> 03:18.473
- Careful, princess.
- Dykey spic.

03:52.679 --> 03:57.679
Get your fucking narc hands
off of me, you fucking fascists!

03:58.884 --> 04:00.186
Good to see you too, Jane.

04:00.219 --> 04:02.354
Where'd they
find her this time?

04:02.389 --> 04:06.558
Up your
mother's gaping asshole!

04:09.361 --> 04:10.663
Say that again.

04:10.697 --> 04:13.233
Your mother
sucks cocks in hell.

04:18.370 --> 04:20.173
You're gonna rot in here, Jane,

04:20.206 --> 04:23.810
no matter how many times
you try to get away.

04:23.843 --> 04:25.577
Remember that.

04:27.480 --> 04:34.036
This is where scum
like you belong.

04:37.357 --> 04:40.093
You mean scum like us?

04:40.125 --> 04:43.430
Takes one to know one, right?

04:47.233 --> 04:50.682
Shut up, Jane! Shut up!

04:56.800 --> 04:59.913
<i>See it there, the Eye of God.</i>

04:59.947 --> 05:03.783
<i>Weeping angrily over the land
of Sodom and Gomorrah.</i>

05:03.817 --> 05:08.555
He will reap this land, he will
pull the weeds and start again.

05:08.588 --> 05:13.425
<i>This broken earth will become
the new holy promised land.</i>

05:13.459 --> 05:17.329
<i>Finally, we will be free
of the two-legged blights,</i>

05:17.363 --> 05:19.800
<i>just as Cain
was free of Abel.</i>

05:19.833 --> 05:24.833
<i>What he created for us
will be ours again.</i>

05:25.706 --> 05:28.375
I'm out here in Cloverton,
where many have gathered

05:28.408 --> 05:30.276
to witness
a disturbing abnormality.

05:30.310 --> 05:34.413
As you can see, the eye...

05:34.447 --> 05:38.283
As you can see,
the eye...

05:38.317 --> 05:39.985
Is it looking at me?

05:51.463 --> 05:53.466
Look at them
quiver in fear.

05:53.500 --> 05:55.201
The rapture begins!

05:55.235 --> 06:00.235
And I, the thorn growing in the wilderness,
will flourish in their absence!

06:02.341 --> 06:03.742
What are you talking about?

06:05.278 --> 06:08.314
Cheese? Of course there
will be cheese in the promised land.

06:08.348 --> 06:09.783
What?

06:09.815 --> 06:13.319
You don't need people for cheese,
we can make cheese!

06:13.353 --> 06:14.754
How hard can it be?

06:14.788 --> 06:16.956
Isn't it just milk and fungus?

06:16.990 --> 06:19.459
I mean, the ancient Egyptians
figured it out.

06:19.492 --> 06:22.194
You take that back!

06:22.196 --> 06:23.495
It is going
to happen this time.

06:23.529 --> 06:24.598
I know it will.

06:24.630 --> 06:28.668
No one can stop
the will of God.

06:28.701 --> 06:30.002
How do we stop this?

06:30.036 --> 06:33.072
I told you,
there's no way.

06:33.105 --> 06:35.009
<i>Aucun. Nada.</i> Nemo!

06:35.041 --> 06:39.211
Once the Decreator's been
summoned, that's it, it's over!

06:39.245 --> 06:41.079
We could've stopped them.

06:41.113 --> 06:42.247
You tried to kill me!

06:42.281 --> 06:44.151
I tried to save
the bloody planet.

06:44.185 --> 06:49.185
Why can't you get that
through your stupid programming!

06:52.658 --> 06:54.394
Rita.
Where are you going?

06:54.427 --> 06:56.295
I need to find Elliot.

06:56.329 --> 06:57.663
That thing in the sky...

06:57.697 --> 07:01.600
I promised to protect him,
Larry. I looked out for him.

07:01.634 --> 07:04.937
I wasn't a lousy bitch
for once.

07:04.971 --> 07:07.105
Turns out a snake
can change her stripes.

07:07.139 --> 07:08.173
Tigers.

07:08.208 --> 07:12.379
What? It doesn't matter.

07:12.411 --> 07:16.783
I have to know if he's okay.

07:16.817 --> 07:21.052
Well, for God sakes, don't get
yourself raptured or anything.

07:22.300 --> 07:23.955
You know, all of this
could've been avoided

07:23.956 --> 07:28.528
if you Halloween costumes come
to life had just done as I said.

07:28.562 --> 07:30.262
He's a boy.

07:30.295 --> 07:31.932
He's one boy.

07:31.964 --> 07:34.235
Versus seven-and-a-half
billion people.

07:34.267 --> 07:37.470
All right. Now, how long do
we have until the world's...

07:37.504 --> 07:39.471
You know, gone?

07:39.505 --> 07:44.444
- Nineteen minutes.
- Really?

07:44.476 --> 07:47.047
I don't fucking know!

07:47.081 --> 07:52.081
Why don't you ask the fucking Eye that's
blinking everything out of existence?

07:53.452 --> 07:54.452
Fuck!

08:02.461 --> 08:07.300
Kay.
That is your name, isn't it?

08:07.333 --> 08:09.103
Aren't you a very small
and pretty thing?

08:09.136 --> 08:13.540
There's no need to be scared,
little thing.

08:13.572 --> 08:15.541
We are lucky.

08:15.574 --> 08:20.045
You... You're so lucky.

08:20.079 --> 08:23.583
You and your squishy friend.

08:23.617 --> 08:26.487
We are in the chosen place,

08:26.519 --> 08:31.519
a special vantage point to watch
from as the world disappears.

08:31.958 --> 08:33.894
Bit by bit.

08:33.927 --> 08:38.063
Person by person, home by home.

08:38.096 --> 08:40.200
Nurnheim...

08:40.234 --> 08:44.202
Will be the last vestige
looked upon by the Eye.

08:44.236 --> 08:47.386
It's a very good day.

08:50.375 --> 08:52.445
Excuse me, ma'am.

08:52.479 --> 08:57.129
I don't want to be Kay anymore.

09:02.389 --> 09:06.960
Very few of
us want to be what we are.

09:06.994 --> 09:11.994
I think I had a little thing
like you once.

09:12.765 --> 09:16.937
But I don't remember.

09:16.970 --> 09:20.972
That must be a gift
from the Eye.

09:23.208 --> 09:27.708
What peace nothingness brings.

09:29.816 --> 09:32.519
No, no, no.
I wasn't just a...

09:32.552 --> 09:34.086
I'm not a fucking brain...

09:34.120 --> 09:37.657
But, but
you're not a brain anymore.

09:37.691 --> 09:39.491
She changed you back.

09:39.525 --> 09:41.628
So that's something.

09:41.660 --> 09:44.197
Screw this. Screw it.
Screw this!

09:44.230 --> 09:49.230
Goddamn place and this
fucking snow and fuck!

09:51.169 --> 09:54.374
Fuck!

09:54.407 --> 09:56.506
What the fuck?

10:09.722 --> 10:11.822
What the fuck?

10:20.933 --> 10:25.004
They've really gone and done it
this time, Niles.

10:25.038 --> 10:29.976
Can't your children
be trusted with anything?

10:30.009 --> 10:33.513
- The goddamned Decreator.
- No.

10:33.546 --> 10:36.984
No, this cannot be the end.
I refuse.

10:37.017 --> 10:38.851
I haven't even been
in the last two episodes.

10:38.884 --> 10:41.386
We can stop it!

10:52.499 --> 10:54.200
It'll be difficult,

10:54.232 --> 10:55.601
but wholly possible.

10:55.634 --> 10:58.903
What do you know
about this thing?

11:00.972 --> 11:02.109
What?

11:02.142 --> 11:05.577
Just marveling at the moment
Mr. Nobody came to realize

11:05.611 --> 11:08.313
his omniscience has limits.

11:08.347 --> 11:09.817
Be careful, Niles.

11:09.850 --> 11:13.886
It's just a little hop, skip and a
jump to the next test of your resolve.

11:13.919 --> 11:18.224
And then the world de-creates,
and you have nothing.

11:18.256 --> 11:20.192
We both have nothing.

11:20.225 --> 11:22.162
So we should work quickly.

11:22.196 --> 11:24.431
The Decreator
is a product of faith.

11:24.465 --> 11:29.465
Born from years upon years
of blind, unwavering belief.

11:30.269 --> 11:33.505
Faith like that can only
be fought with faith alike.

11:33.539 --> 11:35.676
So we build a religion.

11:35.710 --> 11:40.710
We're going to need a leader, someone
charismatic enough to enforce faith,

11:41.881 --> 11:46.451
and nurture the true believers.
This will take time.

11:46.485 --> 11:50.224
- History...
- Yes.

11:50.256 --> 11:53.226
Are you telling me I'm going to have
to comb through a bunch of flashbacks?

11:53.259 --> 11:57.429
I know exactly who we need,
and exactly where to look.

11:57.462 --> 11:58.998
Jane.

11:59.030 --> 12:00.167
Jane.

12:00.200 --> 12:02.769
First we need to find
a very specific version of her.

12:02.802 --> 12:06.740
And then we need to find
someone working in the past,

12:06.773 --> 12:11.309
and someone else
working in the present.

12:11.344 --> 12:14.043
It's the only way.

12:16.783 --> 12:18.217
There isn't much time.

12:18.251 --> 12:22.956
Alas, poor Caulder.
Burdened with a father's fear.

12:22.989 --> 12:26.360
He begs for the ear
of his far superior nemesis.

12:26.393 --> 12:30.764
Will Mr. Nobody and the Chief
truly rally together

12:30.797 --> 12:35.797
for the salvation
of the human race?

12:36.000 --> 12:37.823
Sure.

12:39.899 --> 12:42.642
<i>Onward we go,
into flashback number one,</i>

12:42.643 --> 12:47.013
<i>spiraling down the toilet of culture
into an uprising called "punk."</i>

12:47.700 --> 12:51.049
<i>There she is,
our would-be messiah.</i>

12:51.082 --> 12:52.318
<i>But no.</i>

12:52.351 --> 12:55.855
<i>This isn't the Jane
we need, not exactly.</i>

12:55.889 --> 12:59.626
<i>1976. Ooh, what's this?</i>

12:59.659 --> 13:04.659
<i>Could this be the moment Jane's 64
personalities were given their superpowers?</i>

13:05.932 --> 13:08.467
<i>The very moment?</i>

13:08.500 --> 13:13.139
<i>Boring.</i>

13:13.172 --> 13:15.675
<i>Winter of 1978.</i>

13:15.676 --> 13:20.147
<i>This is the moment Jane first met
the pseudo family she never wanted.</i>

13:20.179 --> 13:22.549
<i>The first time she was given
a real home to live in</i>

13:22.582 --> 13:27.582
<i>that didn't have the pungent smell
of 409 and piss hanging in the air.</i>

13:29.288 --> 13:31.490
Hello, I'm Rita Farr.

13:31.524 --> 13:33.894
Something smells
like dusty queefs.

13:33.927 --> 13:35.761
<i>Oh, Jane.</i>

13:35.794 --> 13:37.530
<i>Dire, incorrigible Jane.</i>

13:37.565 --> 13:42.565
This is all very entertaining, <i>but sadly
not quite what we're looking for.</i>

13:44.703 --> 13:48.642
<i>A-ha! Here we are, 1977.</i>

13:48.676 --> 13:53.613
<i>Perfect. Just the right Jane,
not too soggy, not too stiff.</i>

13:55.014 --> 13:58.118
Things might look a little grim
<i>right now, but trust me,</i>

13:58.150 --> 14:03.150
<i>you're about to bear witness
to the birth of a star.</i>

14:03.289 --> 14:08.289
I will behave. It is my place to behave.
My privilege to...

14:10.229 --> 14:12.532
Jane!

14:12.565 --> 14:13.966
I said to repeat.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.937
The therapy will not work
unless you repeat.

14:16.970 --> 14:19.572
I didn't fucking do it.

14:19.605 --> 14:22.609
Of course not.

14:22.642 --> 14:26.480
You didn't burn your quarters.

14:26.513 --> 14:31.513
And you definitely did not put your
fist through the day room television.

14:32.785 --> 14:34.548
Am I right?

14:36.923 --> 14:38.825
So you're not
fucking deaf, huh?

14:40.293 --> 14:44.798
Oh, you think you're a very
clever girl, don't you, Jane?

14:44.831 --> 14:49.469
Well, we do not abide
smart-mouths or attitude.

14:50.437 --> 14:51.971
Not in my facility.

14:56.775 --> 14:59.746
I'm trying to help you.

14:59.779 --> 15:04.484
I want my patients to get better.
I want you to get better.

15:04.517 --> 15:06.119
But...

15:06.153 --> 15:10.789
If we can't do
this here, together...

15:10.823 --> 15:13.559
I'll have no choice
but to send you away

15:13.594 --> 15:18.594
and have that very bad piece
of you cut out.

15:21.668 --> 15:25.567
We don't want that, do we?

15:28.341 --> 15:29.691
Fuck you.

15:38.784 --> 15:41.120
Let's try a different avenue.

15:41.153 --> 15:46.153
You're not listening to me,
I'm telling you the truth.

15:48.195 --> 15:52.095
Tell me about Kay Challis.

15:54.933 --> 15:55.984
Oh, my.

16:00.139 --> 16:04.910
Have I found your off switch?

16:04.943 --> 16:09.943
Your papers, your real
papers came in today.

16:10.417 --> 16:15.322
Tell me,
when did Kay become Jane?

16:15.355 --> 16:16.923
I don't know
what you're talking about.

16:16.956 --> 16:18.691
Well, then...

16:18.725 --> 16:20.726
Perhaps
the better question is

16:20.759 --> 16:24.360
how did Kay become Jane?

16:28.368 --> 16:33.038
I bet it was
when you were very small.

16:33.072 --> 16:39.668
When the world was very big,
and filled with monsters.

16:41.648 --> 16:43.817
Tell me.

16:43.850 --> 16:46.952
Did your monster
have a name, Kay?

17:07.339 --> 17:11.540
Did yours?

17:15.548 --> 17:17.316
Was her name "Mother"?

17:17.348 --> 17:18.684
What?

17:18.718 --> 17:22.255
Acute narcissism and misogyny.

17:22.288 --> 17:27.288
You're a textbook example
for enduring familial abuse.

17:28.492 --> 17:29.729
Your hair...

17:29.761 --> 17:31.131
Your eyes...

17:31.163 --> 17:35.402
Deflection
is a sign of insecurity.

17:35.434 --> 17:40.434
Do you feel insecure,
Dr. Bertrand?

17:40.874 --> 17:43.343
- Yes.
- Very insecure.

17:43.376 --> 17:45.813
Ever since that day
in the locker room

17:45.846 --> 17:50.817
when you realized you were very
under-developed for a teenage boy.

17:50.851 --> 17:53.221
You can still hear them
laughing at you, can't you?

17:53.253 --> 17:57.089
The way your mother laughed at you
when you went crying into her arms.

17:57.123 --> 18:01.760
What did she call you,
Dr. Bertrand?

18:01.794 --> 18:05.797
Teeny Weenie Peenie.

18:05.798 --> 18:10.170
So much self-loathing.

18:10.202 --> 18:11.770
How do you live with yourself?

18:15.008 --> 18:19.945
There's that feeling again.

18:19.979 --> 18:23.115
It's there, isn't it?

18:23.148 --> 18:25.785
Growing into an impulse.

18:25.817 --> 18:27.319
Yes.

18:27.354 --> 18:32.354
The one that makes you want
to take that pen in your hand,

18:33.326 --> 18:35.728
and jam it into your eye.

18:35.761 --> 18:40.398
Over and over again.

18:40.432 --> 18:42.500
Yes.

18:42.535 --> 18:45.904
Go on, Doctor.

18:45.939 --> 18:48.374
You're finally free
of your mother.

18:50.843 --> 18:54.247
Free to act as you like.

18:54.280 --> 18:58.780
That is your hand, your pen...

19:01.253 --> 19:06.253
And you can jam it in your eye
as many times as you like.

19:06.692 --> 19:09.528
Yes.

19:09.563 --> 19:12.698
Your methods may be ungainly,
Dr. Bertrand.

19:14.200 --> 19:17.604
But your diagnosis
does have its truths.

19:17.637 --> 19:22.637
Once upon a time, my world was
big and filled with monsters.

19:26.011 --> 19:30.362
But now the world is small...

19:32.218 --> 19:35.367
And I am the monster.

19:39.291 --> 19:42.295
<i>Well,
actually, I'm the monster.</i>

19:42.328 --> 19:44.230
<i>But we'll work on that.</i>

19:44.263 --> 19:46.532
<i>Brava, Dr. Harrison, brava!</i>

19:46.566 --> 19:48.968
<i>Aren't you
a marvelous specimen?</i>

19:49.001 --> 19:53.673
<i>So much grit, so much drama.</i>

19:53.707 --> 19:56.742
<i>Suddenly,
her restraints came undone.</i>

20:01.280 --> 20:02.849
Who the hell are you?

20:02.883 --> 20:06.152
<i>Me?
I'm the burning bush in the desert,</i>

20:06.185 --> 20:08.321
<i>the filicidal presence
on the mountain peak,</i>

20:08.355 --> 20:13.355
<i>the voice in Noah's head that made him
fill a boat with animals, two-by-two.</i>

20:14.361 --> 20:18.564
<i>Come, Dr. Harrison.
We have a world to save.</i>

20:26.506 --> 20:30.443
I don't think
that's going to work.

20:30.477 --> 20:32.980
This is not my fucking life.

20:33.012 --> 20:36.316
I didn't turn into a robot,
who turned into a brain,

20:36.348 --> 20:38.285
who gets trapped
in a snow globe

20:38.317 --> 20:40.953
with the most useless fucking
person in the world!

20:40.987 --> 20:43.855
This is not my fucking life!

20:43.890 --> 20:47.826
Shut up!

20:47.859 --> 20:50.497
You think...

20:50.529 --> 20:56.535
This isn't what I wanted
for my life either.

20:56.536 --> 21:00.973
You think I want to
be stuck in here with a brute?

21:01.007 --> 21:02.442
I'm sorry.

21:02.476 --> 21:05.077
You think just because I'm one
of the other personalities,

21:05.111 --> 21:06.747
I don't have feelings?

21:06.779 --> 21:10.349
Jane isn't the only one with hopes,
and dreams, and emotions.

21:10.383 --> 21:13.853
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...

21:13.885 --> 21:15.622
I just...

21:15.623 --> 21:17.489
If this is really
about to go to hell, then...

21:17.490 --> 21:21.595
I just want to spend
my last moments with her.

21:21.627 --> 21:24.897
Well, tough shit, asswipe!

21:24.932 --> 21:29.932
We're not a fucking menu, and you
don't get to make fucking orders!

21:35.875 --> 21:38.111
Elliot.

21:38.144 --> 21:40.246
Elliot,

21:40.279 --> 21:43.279
my God, look at you.

21:48.153 --> 21:52.558
It's different than I imagined.

21:52.592 --> 21:55.662
I sort of pictured
it to be all black.

21:55.695 --> 21:59.865
A black hole
made out of dark fire.

21:59.898 --> 22:01.099
More like Hades

22:01.134 --> 22:06.134
in that book
my mom got me for my...

22:07.772 --> 22:10.173
For my birthday.

22:17.084 --> 22:23.923
They say when you get to hell,
Persephone greets you.

22:24.923 --> 22:27.093
She forgives you,

22:27.125 --> 22:29.976
she walks with you.

22:32.398 --> 22:36.035
Do you think that's true?

22:36.068 --> 22:38.637
I know that look.

22:38.672 --> 22:41.039
It's not your fault, Elliot.

22:41.074 --> 22:43.076
Of course it is.

22:43.108 --> 22:44.943
Everyone's gonna die
because of me.

22:44.977 --> 22:47.247
No.

22:47.279 --> 22:48.682
You should've let me die.

22:48.714 --> 22:53.714
I don't know
what I should've done.

22:53.787 --> 22:57.391
I've never had to save
the goddamn world before.

22:57.424 --> 23:02.424
But I knew I wasn't going to let
someone else die for all of this.

23:07.567 --> 23:11.538
Maybe you haven't seen
the world, Elliot, but I have,

23:11.570 --> 23:14.340
and trust me, it's garbage.

23:14.374 --> 23:18.878
People lie,
and they hurt each other.

23:18.912 --> 23:23.912
And they wear these things
on their feet called Crocs.

23:26.519 --> 23:29.655
I went with my gut,

23:29.690 --> 23:33.226
and my gut says
you deserve a break.

23:33.259 --> 23:37.430
We both do.

23:37.463 --> 23:39.532
So it's the end of the world.

23:39.566 --> 23:42.115
But we have time.

23:44.971 --> 23:46.373
We should do something.

23:46.405 --> 23:50.175
Something special.

23:50.210 --> 23:53.113
- Like what?
- Anything.

23:53.146 --> 23:56.782
What have you always
wanted to do?

23:56.817 --> 23:59.952
A place you've
always wanted to see.

23:59.987 --> 24:02.521
Food you've always
wanted to taste...

24:02.556 --> 24:05.023
- Anything.
- Um...

24:05.057 --> 24:09.258
Whatever it is, we'll do it.

24:47.500 --> 24:49.150
Oh, my God.

25:02.815 --> 25:05.785
Oh...

25:05.817 --> 25:07.554
Mmm.

25:07.586 --> 25:09.922
So now you can walk?

25:09.955 --> 25:11.257
Mmm!

25:11.290 --> 25:13.727
You're not the Chief.
You can't be.

25:13.759 --> 25:15.804
- I'm enough of him.
- What the hell does that mean?

25:15.828 --> 25:18.163
How did you get here and
what happened to Mr. Nobody?

25:18.196 --> 25:22.568
Don't ask him about Mr. Nobody!

25:22.602 --> 25:25.872
Or mention his name.

25:25.905 --> 25:28.775
Trust me.
My favorite pumps were ruined.

25:28.808 --> 25:31.277
- Jesus, Niles. You're a mess.
- A mess?

25:31.310 --> 25:32.878
This is dangerous.

25:32.913 --> 25:37.913
What if he's a bomb
sent here by Mr. Nobody?

25:39.853 --> 25:42.288
Chief, you have to let us help you.
Tell us where...

25:42.321 --> 25:43.690
Please.

25:43.722 --> 25:48.494
The only booby-trap he laid
was the one in my esophagus.

25:48.528 --> 25:50.329
I promise you.

25:50.363 --> 25:52.398
I know this is hard to take in.

25:52.432 --> 25:55.800
And I can't imagine what you've
been going through for this last...

25:57.537 --> 25:59.605
48 hours, but...

25:59.638 --> 26:01.540
We have a plan.

26:01.574 --> 26:05.011
In motion.

26:05.045 --> 26:08.048
It's a bit wonky,
but it will work.

26:08.080 --> 26:11.116
And it's the best we could come
up with under the circumstances.

26:11.150 --> 26:12.417
What do you mean "we"?

26:12.451 --> 26:14.386
You're working together?

26:14.420 --> 26:18.170
- Wait. You and Mr....
- No!

26:20.159 --> 26:22.558
I had no choice.

26:25.765 --> 26:28.267
No need to explain.

26:28.300 --> 26:30.069
I'm done
playing gooseberry.

26:30.103 --> 26:32.349
And unlike this collection
of limp dicks you've assembled,

26:32.373 --> 26:37.373
I am perfectly aware the apocalypse
makes for some very odd bedfellows.

26:38.278 --> 26:40.047
Survival and all that.

26:40.079 --> 26:44.484
Now, tell us what needs
to be done.

26:44.518 --> 26:47.686
<i>All you have to
do is stick to the script.</i>

26:47.721 --> 26:49.521
<i>There will be a boy born</i>

26:49.556 --> 26:50.934
<i>with the words
of an ancient language</i>

26:50.958 --> 26:53.394
sprouting on him through time.

26:53.426 --> 26:56.997
<i>Once he's 18, the scripture
on his skin will be complete,</i>

26:57.029 --> 27:00.432
<i>and the cult that you foster,
my dear Dr. Harrison,</i>

27:00.467 --> 27:02.502
<i>will converge
at his dwelling place</i>

27:02.536 --> 27:07.536
<i>and chant the verses together in order
to conjure our grotesque messiah.</i>

27:08.875 --> 27:11.344
The Re-Creator.

27:16.115 --> 27:18.684
"The Re-Creator"?

27:18.718 --> 27:22.155
Let me get this straight.

27:22.189 --> 27:25.724
You want to fight something
called the "Decreator"

27:25.759 --> 27:27.661
with something
called the "Re-Creator"?

27:27.693 --> 27:30.028
So I'm no L. Ron Hubbard.

27:30.061 --> 27:31.431
Who has the time?

27:31.463 --> 27:35.300
That is some weak sauce,
mister.

27:35.335 --> 27:36.836
Then take this
as an opportunity

27:36.869 --> 27:41.869
to test your powers
of influence, Dr. Harrison.

27:41.974 --> 27:46.325
Are you up for the challenge?

27:47.246 --> 27:48.448
Fuck!

28:04.397 --> 28:08.535
- Who was that in the cathedral?
- Stop.

28:09.869 --> 28:12.038
Never seen her before.

28:12.071 --> 28:13.673
Kay, right? Is that her name?

28:13.707 --> 28:16.542
Shut your fucking hole!

28:16.576 --> 28:18.978
Jesus!

28:19.010 --> 28:20.313
I'm sorry.

28:20.346 --> 28:22.981
I just wanted to thank her.

28:24.084 --> 28:26.419
She cared enough to pick
me up when I was just a...

28:26.451 --> 28:29.455
A brain on the floor.

28:29.490 --> 28:33.192
Well, you're never gonna talk to
her, or about her, ever again.

28:33.227 --> 28:36.930
God, can't we just ride out the
apocalypse without all this shit?

28:36.962 --> 28:39.865
I thought we had
a good thing going.

28:39.900 --> 28:43.869
Two freaks on a yellow brick
road, or something like that.

28:43.903 --> 28:44.938
I thought you knew me.

28:44.971 --> 28:49.171
No. You thought you knew me.

28:52.846 --> 28:56.349
Odd way to meet
an old friend, again.

28:56.383 --> 28:58.817
Standing on two legs,
working with the enemy.

28:58.852 --> 29:01.421
Surrounded by his menagerie.

29:01.453 --> 29:03.222
Aren't we creatures of "odd"?

29:03.257 --> 29:05.791
As I recall, the last time
I saw you,

29:05.825 --> 29:08.499
you left me for dead
in a cavern in Istanbul.

29:08.500 --> 29:10.230
You wouldn't stop whining
at me.

29:10.263 --> 29:13.133
Besides, I was in urgent need
of a drink.

29:13.165 --> 29:17.965
Good to see
you haven't changed.

29:19.405 --> 29:25.000
So, are you sure about him?
He-who-cannot-be-named.

29:25.010 --> 29:27.413
It's the only shot we've got.

29:27.448 --> 29:31.183
If all goes to plan, Baphomet will
point us towards the Re-written Book.

29:31.218 --> 29:34.721
We find him, and we summon
the Re-Creator.

29:34.753 --> 29:38.791
Re-written Book?

29:38.825 --> 29:40.727
So another boy's going
to have to suffer?

29:40.759 --> 29:45.698
Don't be
so sentimental, sweetheart.

29:45.731 --> 29:48.634
It'll give you crow's feet.

29:52.038 --> 29:54.141
Oh, what is it now, Willou...

29:54.173 --> 29:57.676
Niles! Well,
what a delightful surprise.

29:57.711 --> 30:01.780
Baphomet.
How lovely to see you again.

30:01.815 --> 30:04.550
There's that silky voice
I miss.

30:04.584 --> 30:06.286
Like hot jam and honey.

30:06.319 --> 30:09.388
You really do turn my trot
into a gallop, Mr. Caulder.

30:09.422 --> 30:10.656
Oh, you're too kind.

30:10.690 --> 30:12.425
Aww!

30:12.459 --> 30:15.169
Are you two gonna get a stable or can we
get on with this Re-Creator business?

30:15.193 --> 30:17.163
Uh, Re-Creator?

30:17.196 --> 30:19.632
We're looking for
the Re-written Book.

30:19.665 --> 30:21.234
Do you sense it?

30:21.268 --> 30:24.369
Re-written?
Hmm, I don't see it.

30:24.403 --> 30:25.905
There is no such thing.

30:25.939 --> 30:28.641
And there your plan goes
tits up.

30:28.674 --> 30:31.644
Give it time.

30:31.678 --> 30:32.913
Baphomet...

30:32.945 --> 30:35.115
<i>Oui,</i> Mr. Caulder?

30:35.147 --> 30:38.884
Would you mind
trying again, please?

30:38.919 --> 30:41.922
<i>Yes, you dumb
horse-head, look again.</i>

30:41.954 --> 30:46.954
<i>Because it's all happening,
baby.</i>

30:52.832 --> 30:56.769
Okay, Jane, I'm coming in.

30:56.803 --> 30:58.805
You better fucking
handle yourself!

30:58.837 --> 31:00.339
Because if you don't,

31:00.374 --> 31:05.374
I'm gonna fucking knock
your goddamn lights out.

31:13.586 --> 31:14.854
You're so right.

31:14.887 --> 31:17.089
He hears your worries.

31:17.124 --> 31:19.424
He hears your distress.

31:19.459 --> 31:20.994
The Re-Creator?

31:20.996 --> 31:23.863
<i>Dr. Harrison's gift of
super-powered charm and influence</i>

31:23.896 --> 31:26.299
<i>made her a regular
ol' Bonnie Nettles.</i>

31:26.333 --> 31:30.369
Why are you swallowing
these pharmaceuticals?

31:30.403 --> 31:35.409
You know as well as I do that the only
true healing you need is the Re-Creator.

31:37.344 --> 31:42.344
The cult will help you find
your purpose.

31:42.682 --> 31:46.885
Your true calling.

31:46.920 --> 31:50.623
Isn't that
what you always wanted?

31:54.894 --> 31:58.365
You know what you have to do.

31:58.397 --> 32:04.502
You know you have to spread the word
of the Re-Creator far and wide.

32:04.503 --> 32:05.806
Yes!

32:05.839 --> 32:09.075
You are worthy
of this lifelong dream of yours.

32:09.108 --> 32:12.011
- You can change the world!
- Yes!

32:12.045 --> 32:14.913
- You can save the world.
- Yes!

32:14.948 --> 32:16.215
Yes!

32:16.249 --> 32:21.020
Re-Creator!
Re-Creator! Re-Creator!

32:21.054 --> 32:24.057
Hey, this is a pretty
good cult.

32:24.089 --> 32:27.527
Oh, yeah. Way better than
the last three I've been in.

32:27.559 --> 32:30.663
Re-Creator! Re-Creator!

32:30.696 --> 32:35.567
Re-Creator! Re-Creator!

32:43.409 --> 32:45.808
Let me help you.

32:58.592 --> 33:01.193
What does your father think
of all this?

33:01.228 --> 33:05.877
He knows what he needs to know.

33:06.833 --> 33:11.604
You shouldn't
have come here, Vic.

33:11.636 --> 33:14.106
I came here because of you.

33:14.141 --> 33:16.609
The only reason I got hurt
is 'cause of your friend.

33:16.644 --> 33:19.145
If I knew you had a habit
of working with the dark side,

33:19.146 --> 33:20.711
I would have been more careful
around him.

33:20.712 --> 33:22.281
You're being absurd.

33:22.316 --> 33:23.950
Because I have a moral compass?

33:23.983 --> 33:26.252
Willoughby and I
are working together

33:26.286 --> 33:27.587
to try and save this world...

33:27.621 --> 33:30.056
- Save the world, right, I got you.
- From destruction.

33:30.089 --> 33:33.026
So suddenly it's okay
to play both sides of the line?

33:33.058 --> 33:35.228
Work with the evil?

33:35.261 --> 33:37.429
You are so far up
your own ass.

33:37.430 --> 33:39.565
No! What?

33:39.598 --> 33:41.701
I know the difference.

33:41.733 --> 33:43.736
There's good and there's evil.

33:43.769 --> 33:46.606
I know which side I want
to be on.

33:46.640 --> 33:50.277
Man, not so long ago,
a smart man once told me,

33:50.309 --> 33:53.113
"You need to hold onto
who Vic Stone is."

33:53.145 --> 33:54.748
That's who I am.
That's where I stand.

33:54.781 --> 33:57.250
Then I'm sorry I don't live up
to your expectations.

33:57.284 --> 34:00.053
I don't know why I care.

34:00.086 --> 34:04.089
You're not even you right now.

34:04.124 --> 34:07.126
Hey, have you
ever heard of Nurnheim?

34:07.160 --> 34:08.862
Of course. Why?

34:08.896 --> 34:13.266
Willoughby sent Jane and Cliff to
Barcelona to find the Gates to Nurnheim.

34:13.300 --> 34:17.603
What? Why would he do
such a foolish thing?

34:17.637 --> 34:20.373
'Cause
they bloody well insisted, that's why.

34:20.407 --> 34:23.409
- You're a bloody fool, Kipling.
- What is that?

34:23.443 --> 34:28.148
There it is. Stolen from me.
Like everything else around here.

34:28.181 --> 34:29.282
That's Nurnheim?

34:29.315 --> 34:31.518
Never mind. Baphomet
found it, Niles.

34:31.552 --> 34:35.588
So whatever scheme you and that
abomination cooked up is working.

34:35.621 --> 34:40.621
The Re-written Book exists,
and it's not far from here.

34:53.539 --> 34:55.942
Let's go.

34:55.974 --> 35:00.581
Come on.

35:00.614 --> 35:03.182
Why am I always the one
doing your grunt work, Niles?

35:03.215 --> 35:06.052
There's brains
and there's brawn, Willoughby.

35:06.085 --> 35:07.735
Yeah, yeah.

35:23.168 --> 35:25.505
The spirit...

35:25.539 --> 35:27.706
It let the first
Unwritten Book go.

35:27.739 --> 35:29.976
It put the boy in harm's way.

35:30.009 --> 35:32.780
Not that it mattered
in the end.

35:32.813 --> 35:37.451
But whatever I do, it always finds
a way to hurt me, punish me.

35:37.483 --> 35:40.085
What makes you think
it's punishing you?

35:40.119 --> 35:43.856
I saw the tape,
of you and the machine.

35:43.889 --> 35:45.791
Why didn't you tell me?

35:45.824 --> 35:50.230
I didn't think you were ready.

35:50.262 --> 35:51.697
Larry, the...

35:51.731 --> 35:56.731
The spirit only feels tortured
because you torture yourself.

35:57.436 --> 36:01.574
Hearing it say that,
it sounded so...

36:01.606 --> 36:02.909
True.

36:02.943 --> 36:06.945
I feel like everyone I've ever
gotten close to has felt that way.

36:06.980 --> 36:08.581
- Tortured.
- Larry...

36:08.614 --> 36:11.463
That name. My name.

36:13.786 --> 36:16.454
Sounds so long ago.

36:16.489 --> 36:19.057
So foreign.

36:19.092 --> 36:21.594
Strange.

36:21.628 --> 36:24.396
Sometimes I wonder if
Larry Trainor died years ago

36:24.431 --> 36:29.431
and this is some
fucked-up afterlife.

36:30.302 --> 36:34.407
Other times, I think I am
the fucked-up afterlife.

36:34.440 --> 36:39.440
Dragging everyone into
my own personal shit-storm hell.

36:42.181 --> 36:45.050
That's what I see, you know...

36:45.085 --> 36:48.088
Every time
the spirit leaves me.

36:48.121 --> 36:51.157
I see everyone I've ever loved.

36:51.190 --> 36:53.260
Burning.

36:53.293 --> 36:54.628
Because of me.

36:54.661 --> 36:58.099
Have you ever tried
communicating this to the spirit?

36:58.132 --> 37:03.132
It's a lot more sensitive
and powerful than you might think.

37:04.137 --> 37:07.639
Perhaps you should
give it a try.

37:08.742 --> 37:11.043
- What are you doing?
- Be quiet.

37:11.077 --> 37:12.112
Calm down, please.

37:12.144 --> 37:13.412
- Help!
- Hold him still.

37:13.413 --> 37:16.282
Hurry up. He smells like
a dolly grip on a hot day.

37:16.315 --> 37:18.050
My God.

37:18.083 --> 37:20.786
Yeah, right.

37:25.157 --> 37:28.061
"Peace and love."

37:29.262 --> 37:32.197
"Ass is life." Flip him over!

37:35.367 --> 37:37.936
This isn't a Re-written Book.

37:37.971 --> 37:39.338
It's a douchebag.

37:39.371 --> 37:41.608
<i>I should
probably explain.</i>

37:41.641 --> 37:44.610
<i>You see, it turns out
the psychiatric patients</i>

37:44.644 --> 37:48.514
<i>had a flair for the creative.
Who would have known?</i>

37:48.547 --> 37:51.885
When the
Decreator appears in the sky,

37:51.918 --> 37:55.521
you will know it is time
to call upon the Re-Creator.

37:55.554 --> 38:01.635
In order to do so, a boy,
known as the Re-written Book,

38:02.195 --> 38:07.099
covered in ancient script,
must be read.

38:07.132 --> 38:08.835
Does it have to be a boy?

38:08.869 --> 38:12.803
I also have an issue with the
overt use of male-gender pronouns

38:12.804 --> 38:13.739
in this exercise.

38:13.740 --> 38:16.842
Gloria Steinem over here.

38:16.876 --> 38:18.612
Suck a tailpipe, Marilyn.

38:18.644 --> 38:23.516
How about a dog
instead of a boy?

38:23.550 --> 38:27.253
I like dogs.

38:27.286 --> 38:29.088
You hear that?

38:29.121 --> 38:30.657
Shh. Shh!

38:40.099 --> 38:43.637
And what's with the words
being visible all the time?

38:43.670 --> 38:47.340
Isn't that a dead giveaway to anyone
who might be hunting the Book?

38:47.373 --> 38:50.010
Yeah, the words
should be invisible.

38:50.043 --> 38:52.354
If I had something that was
gonna stop the world from ending,

38:52.378 --> 38:57.282
I'd want to hide it.
You know, from bad guys.

39:08.228 --> 39:09.829
<i>That's good logic.</i>

39:09.862 --> 39:12.666
But if no one will be able to read
the words, then I don't see...

39:12.699 --> 39:15.967
I know. What if there's a bell?

39:16.001 --> 39:18.572
And then, you ring it.

39:18.605 --> 39:21.773
And then the writing appears.

39:21.806 --> 39:24.177
Marilyn.

39:24.210 --> 39:27.581
You are brilliant.

39:27.614 --> 39:32.351
When the time comes,
you will be my chosen one.

39:32.385 --> 39:34.755
You will be the one
to come find me,

39:34.788 --> 39:36.757
to remind me of what
must be done.

39:36.789 --> 39:40.193
<i>Yes, Dr. Harrison
was a perfect creature.</i>

39:40.226 --> 39:44.764
<i>Except of course for one
small hitch in her personality.</i>

39:44.797 --> 39:48.135
- What do you want your other followers to do?
- Yeah.

39:48.168 --> 39:52.237
<i>She was utterly
and marvelously insane.</i>

39:52.271 --> 39:56.708
Dance.

39:56.742 --> 39:58.577
Dance.

39:58.612 --> 40:03.215
Like there's a giant eye
in the sky watching you.

40:33.146 --> 40:34.715
Is this part of the plan?

40:41.989 --> 40:45.123
I think something's
supposed to happen.

40:50.262 --> 40:52.398
What the fuck?

41:06.746 --> 41:09.014
Chief!

41:09.047 --> 41:11.016
We gotta go.

41:25.998 --> 41:30.998
Holy cannoli,
I'm not in Jersey anymore.

41:31.704 --> 41:35.943
Dr. Harrison, it's me!

41:35.976 --> 41:39.244
Now, I know what
you're gonna say...

41:39.278 --> 41:41.648
I haven't changed one bit.

41:41.681 --> 41:45.284
Chock it up to tomato pie
and a pack a day.

41:45.318 --> 41:46.719
Who the hell are you?

41:46.753 --> 41:49.623
Marilyn.
From Corpus Sanatorium.

41:49.655 --> 41:51.724
Nah, I think
you're mistaken, lady.

41:51.757 --> 41:56.329
Honey, I just traveled all the
way from Jersey to Barcelona,

41:56.362 --> 41:58.798
cut open a priest,
climbed inside him,

41:58.831 --> 42:00.634
and landed in a snow globe.

42:00.666 --> 42:03.436
And now I'm standing here
talking to a freaking Robotman.

42:03.469 --> 42:07.940
I don't think I'm mistaken.

42:07.974 --> 42:12.478
Sweetie, I'm here because
you wanted me to be.

42:12.512 --> 42:16.615
You gave me purpose
when I needed it.

42:16.650 --> 42:18.851
Now the world needs you.

42:18.885 --> 42:21.353
To ring that bell over there.

42:21.387 --> 42:25.159
It's time, sweetie.

42:31.331 --> 42:33.266
Marilyn.

42:33.298 --> 42:36.436
- Good to see you.
- Oh, my love.

42:36.469 --> 42:39.672
Oh, shit.

42:39.706 --> 42:42.442
Go. I got this.

42:42.474 --> 42:45.378
You! What have you done!

42:45.411 --> 42:47.480
Well, looky here.

42:47.514 --> 42:49.815
I didn't know the circus
was coming to town.

42:49.849 --> 42:54.019
And you got
all the clowns with you, huh?

42:54.052 --> 42:56.789
So, uh, come on.

42:56.822 --> 43:00.059
You're gonna show me
a show, or what?

43:02.461 --> 43:04.030
What's going on?

43:04.063 --> 43:05.998
I don't know.
You're the one with the plan.

43:09.501 --> 43:10.903
It's getting faster.

43:10.936 --> 43:14.673
How dare you intervene
with the vision of the Decreator.

43:14.708 --> 43:17.777
You think that you can spit
in the face of God.

43:17.811 --> 43:21.614
Lady, the only god
I worship is Springsteen.

43:21.648 --> 43:26.018
And I've spat
in his face twice.

43:26.052 --> 43:28.153
Viva la Re-Creator!

43:34.494 --> 43:37.193
Holy shit!

43:44.369 --> 43:47.670
What the hell is that?

43:52.210 --> 43:56.349
My God!

43:56.382 --> 43:58.617
You fucking legend.

44:19.773 --> 44:22.023
The Re-Creator!

44:40.193 --> 44:43.362
What's going on?

44:43.396 --> 44:48.045
I think it's a staring contest.

45:01.313 --> 45:03.682
By the skin of our teeth.

45:03.717 --> 45:05.184
As always.

45:05.219 --> 45:08.454
I'd like to help you with this
Nobody business, but, uh...

45:08.487 --> 45:10.389
Then I'd have to admit
that I like you.

45:10.422 --> 45:12.523
Heaven forbid.

45:17.563 --> 45:19.411
Ah!

45:21.534 --> 45:22.668
May we never meet again.

45:22.702 --> 45:25.851
Likewise, old friend.

45:42.822 --> 45:46.826
The boy, Elliot...

45:46.860 --> 45:48.293
Do you think he's back?

45:48.327 --> 45:50.563
There's a chance, right?

45:51.864 --> 45:55.166
You astound me, Rita.

45:55.201 --> 45:56.969
Go.

45:57.003 --> 45:59.639
Don't you dare return to them.

45:59.672 --> 46:00.672
Go.

46:16.856 --> 46:19.925
It's best she's not here.

46:19.960 --> 46:22.295
Saying goodbye to you all
is going to be hard enough.

46:22.329 --> 46:27.329
Uh-uh, no. Ain't no way I'm
letting them take you again.

46:27.400 --> 46:32.139
A deal's a deal, Vic.

46:32.172 --> 46:36.521
Chief!
What the hell!

46:49.188 --> 46:50.188
Jane.

46:57.097 --> 46:59.498
<i>It was a touching scene.</i>

46:59.532 --> 47:01.934
Chief and Jane together again.

47:01.967 --> 47:06.672
But, alas, our fun little romp
<i>must come to an end.</i>

47:06.706 --> 47:08.974
Come on, Niles, make it snappy.

47:09.009 --> 47:11.210
Let's not turn this two-parter
<i>into a trilogy.</i>

47:11.244 --> 47:12.478
You want him...

47:13.880 --> 47:14.981
Come and get him.

47:15.014 --> 47:20.014
<i>Time moved slowly.</i>

47:25.891 --> 47:28.929
You told me
I could say goodbye!

47:28.961 --> 47:32.798
<i>The kid
took out a gun.</i>

47:32.831 --> 47:34.967
Please.

47:36.369 --> 47:38.672
You promised
you wouldn't hurt them.

47:38.706 --> 47:42.407
<i>Oh, I promise,
Niles, I won't hurt them.</i>

47:43.844 --> 47:47.347
<i>There he was.
Daddy's favorite science project,</i>

47:47.380 --> 47:49.916
<i>resolute to do anything
he could to save the Chief.</i>

47:49.951 --> 47:54.788
<i>But Cyborg didn't even realize
he'd left his arm cannon charging.</i>

47:54.820 --> 47:57.556
Goodbye, Victor Stone.

48:03.730 --> 48:06.331
Oh, shit. Shit!

48:06.364 --> 48:07.699
Vic.

48:07.733 --> 48:10.335
Shit. Shit. Oh, no.

48:10.369 --> 48:12.672
Oh, no, no, no!

48:12.704 --> 48:15.208
Holy shit!

48:15.242 --> 48:17.510
- What is that?
- Don't! It's an emergency trigger!

48:17.543 --> 48:21.248
It rebuilds, it fixes, fixes damage.
With cybernetics.

48:21.280 --> 48:22.983
Good.
So, I just push it?

48:23.016 --> 48:25.018
No, no, no. Don't!
If you press it, my dad...

48:25.050 --> 48:27.019
- What?
- It'll send an SOS.

48:27.052 --> 48:28.465
Well, you can't just sit here
like this.

48:28.489 --> 48:31.190
Back up, off me!
I'll figure it out.

48:34.094 --> 48:36.228
What do we do? Tell us
what you want us to do.

48:36.262 --> 48:38.330
Sorry, bud.
This is for your own good.

48:38.331 --> 48:39.298
Cliff, stop!

48:39.299 --> 48:40.900
Fuck what he said.
He needs help.

48:45.172 --> 48:49.275
Grid, no. No, stop, stop!
Grid, stop!

49:05.192 --> 49:10.192
<i>A butterfly
beats its wings in the Amazon.</i>

49:10.563 --> 49:15.563
<i>And a hurricane brews
in the Atlantic.</i>

49:16.469 --> 49:21.469
<i>Millions of poor die
in the eastern reaches of Asia.</i>

49:24.210 --> 49:28.581
<i>The destruction inspires
a future leader, dictator,</i>

49:28.614 --> 49:30.250
<i>mass murderer.</i>

49:56.009 --> 49:57.510
Sheryl...

49:57.543 --> 50:00.480
What have you done, Larry?
What have you done?

50:15.561 --> 50:19.932
<i>Chaos theory
is beautiful, but so slow.</i>

50:19.965 --> 50:22.312
<i>So, so slow.</i>

50:22.313 --> 50:25.637
<i>I guess it's up to me
to step on the gas.</i>

50:25.672 --> 50:26.940
<i>Again!</i>

50:26.942 --> 50:28.684
Where are you taking me?
It's past lights-out.

50:28.708 --> 50:32.045
As I mentioned previously, Jane,
if you continued to get worse,

50:32.077 --> 50:35.181
drastic action would be taken.
And here we are.

50:35.215 --> 50:39.119
At wit's end. So to speak.

50:39.152 --> 50:41.086
An ice-pick death.

50:41.121 --> 50:43.190
Some of the doctors
call it that.

50:43.222 --> 50:46.659
I guess that's more poetic
than prefrontal leucotomy.

50:46.693 --> 50:48.994
Well, that doesn't surprise me.

50:49.028 --> 50:52.331
It is what you do,
isn't it, Dr. Bertrand?

50:52.364 --> 50:54.067
Give up.

50:54.099 --> 50:58.338
I do wish I could hear
what it is you're saying.

50:58.371 --> 51:03.371
But, we all know how dangerous
that can be, so...

51:05.211 --> 51:06.746
Oh, but, don't worry.

51:06.780 --> 51:10.416
I'm sure we'll have more entertaining
conversations when you return.

51:10.449 --> 51:14.153
However, I think they will probably
be a little more one-sided.

51:14.186 --> 51:17.123
Enjoy your trip.

51:17.157 --> 51:19.259
You're a coward! You're a coward!

51:19.291 --> 51:21.760
- Come on!
- You're a coward!

51:24.063 --> 51:29.063
Get in the van, Jane.

51:29.670 --> 51:34.670
Oh, don't worry. They're only
gonna take one little piece out.

51:38.110 --> 51:39.512
You'll be back here in no time.

51:39.545 --> 51:43.782
Eating pudding and pissing
yourself in the day room.

51:43.815 --> 51:45.117
Right where you belong.

51:45.150 --> 51:47.186
You're a failure.
You're nothing.

51:47.219 --> 51:52.219
You'll always be nothing,
just as Daddy always said.

52:00.900 --> 52:02.400
Shit!

52:05.972 --> 52:08.074
Lovely evening,
isn't it?

52:08.108 --> 52:13.108
Now, who do I have the honor
of meeting tonight?

52:13.447 --> 52:15.849
You must be very proud
of yourself.

52:15.882 --> 52:19.954
A cog in the engine of barbaric
psycho-science practices.

52:19.987 --> 52:24.987
Ah, Dr. Harrison, if you look under
the bench on your right-hand side,

52:26.159 --> 52:31.159
you'll find a key
for your restraints.

52:36.268 --> 52:39.119
And one more thing.

52:42.175 --> 52:45.512
Your wristband.

52:45.545 --> 52:49.983
Look, I'm sorry, you'll have
to come up here.

52:50.016 --> 52:51.851
I can't move very well.

52:51.884 --> 52:53.885
Who are you?

52:53.920 --> 52:55.521
Niles.

52:55.554 --> 53:00.554
I'm taking you to a safe place.
A place to heal.

53:01.427 --> 53:04.878
I'm not gonna hurt you.

53:16.710 --> 53:21.710
You're never going to wear
one of these ever again.

53:23.215 --> 53:26.119
Now, settle down.

53:26.152 --> 53:30.623
We have quite a ride
ahead of us.

54:04.356 --> 54:06.326
Dare I say, he seems nice.

54:06.358 --> 54:10.563
<i>Please!</i>

54:10.597 --> 54:15.597
<i>I have one more task
for you, Dr. Harrison.</i>

54:16.101 --> 54:17.471
What is it?

54:17.472 --> 54:19.771
<i>Once the whole
Decreator fiasco is over with,</i>

54:19.773 --> 54:21.608
<i>I need you to look
for something.</i>

54:21.641 --> 54:24.244
<i>A small whispering
thought will come to you</i>

54:24.277 --> 54:26.711
<i>once the apocalypse
has been neutralized.</i>

54:26.746 --> 54:29.014
<i>A flicker of a name.</i>

54:29.047 --> 54:33.219
What do you need me
to look for?

54:46.666 --> 54:48.668
What the fuck
is the Doom Patrol?

54:49.305 --> 54:55.416
