00:03.520 --> 00:06.120
-What?
-Did you kill Konrad?

00:07.000 --> 00:09.760
Who do you think I am?

00:09.840 --> 00:12.440
So you don't know
what happened to him?

00:15.320 --> 00:17.320
I don't want anything
more to do with you.

00:17.400 --> 00:21.440
He was shot at very close range,
upward trajectory.

00:25.400 --> 00:29.120
-What's this?
-It was stuck to his glove.

00:29.200 --> 00:32.680
-From a coat?
-Possibly, but not his.

00:33.280 --> 00:35.800
What the hell do I do?
I have no money.

00:35.880 --> 00:38.960
<i>Take care of it somehow,</i>
<i>just stay out of sight.</i>

00:39.040 --> 00:41.200
<i>Hold on...</i>

00:41.280 --> 00:43.880
<i>I've got a number here,</i>
<i>Misha's contact in Åland.</i>

00:47.200 --> 00:51.720
<i>Only use it in case of emergency. You</i>
<i>don't know what kind of guy he is.</i>

00:55.560 --> 00:57.120
Hello?

00:59.200 --> 01:00.480
Kim?

01:01.560 --> 01:02.520
<i>Kim, are you there?</i>

01:06.160 --> 01:08.840
I want a divorce.

01:16.440 --> 01:17.720
I'm pregnant.

01:32.320 --> 01:36.760
-What happened to the door?
-You don't want to know.

01:39.840 --> 01:42.840
It's freezing in here.

01:46.760 --> 01:49.840
It seems like ages since
we were here.

01:57.680 --> 02:00.680
What are you going to do?
Are you keeping it?

02:02.920 --> 02:04.160
I don't know.

02:09.560 --> 02:12.520
You can't, Liv.
I can't be a father again.

02:13.680 --> 02:16.440
I shouldn't have a kid.

02:16.520 --> 02:20.480
I should never have been a dad.
I can't take care of myself.

02:20.560 --> 02:24.120
Are you done pitying yourself

02:24.200 --> 02:26.440
so we can talk like adults
about what's happened?

02:29.400 --> 02:33.440
-He can never know.
-And how would you work that out?

02:33.520 --> 02:36.920
-Don't tell him about the abortion.
-And what if I want to keep it?

02:39.600 --> 02:40.760
Don't tell him it's mine.

02:47.240 --> 02:53.040
In a way, I've enjoyed having
you two fight over me.

02:53.120 --> 02:56.400
I thought it somehow made me special.

02:57.680 --> 03:02.240
But the truth is that
I'm totally replaceable.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.920
You only care about each other.

03:07.160 --> 03:10.720
I could be anyone,
I'm not even a person.

03:10.800 --> 03:14.640
I'm just some kind of prize
for the winner!

03:14.720 --> 03:16.560
That's not true.

03:16.640 --> 03:21.120
So when we slept together, you didn't
want to prove that I was yours?

03:21.200 --> 03:25.720
No! It was a mistake and
we have to try to make things right.

03:25.800 --> 03:29.720
Who the hell are you to
dictate terms to the rest of us?!

03:29.800 --> 03:33.480
I'm not dictating anything!
I just don't want to hurt anyone!

03:33.560 --> 03:37.120
You make terrible decisions
and you think it's for the best!

03:37.200 --> 03:39.840
Then the rest of us have to deal
with the consequences!

03:41.960 --> 03:45.560
You come here,
stir things up and then you leave.

03:45.640 --> 03:49.200
I know. I know that's what I've done.

03:50.640 --> 03:53.960
But I can't do this anymore.

03:55.440 --> 03:56.240
Liv...

03:57.920 --> 04:03.600
If you tell Oskar,
I'll lose him. Again.

04:05.240 --> 04:10.360
I don't have anywhere else to go.
I'm here to try to make things right.

04:10.440 --> 04:15.760
So am I,
but some things can't be made right.

04:15.840 --> 04:18.040
No, but you have to let me try.

04:19.240 --> 04:22.240
He may forgive you...

04:23.800 --> 04:26.480
but he'll never forgive me.

05:13.880 --> 05:17.520
THICKER THAN WATER

05:56.240 --> 06:01.160
-Did she hesitate before signing it?
-People are different.

06:02.360 --> 06:06.520
Some brace themselves
to avoid their own feelings.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.880
What will you do once
the divorce is final?

06:09.960 --> 06:12.960
Lasse and I will run the place
together.

06:13.040 --> 06:16.240
-Lasse and you?
-Yeah.

06:16.320 --> 06:21.320
Well, that should be just fine.

06:21.400 --> 06:24.320
I think that's what Anna-Lisa
would have wanted.

06:24.400 --> 06:29.120
I have to make sure
I don't sign in the wrong place...

06:29.200 --> 06:33.840
Oskar... take the papers home.

06:33.920 --> 06:38.240
Read through them and
sign when you're ready.

06:38.320 --> 06:40.800
No hurry.

06:41.680 --> 06:44.280
No, that's probably for the best.

06:48.320 --> 06:50.040
Yeah...

07:11.120 --> 07:14.000
-Hi.
-Hi there.

07:16.960 --> 07:19.680
The last Christmas buffet.

07:21.160 --> 07:24.960
-We did it.
-We? You did it.

07:25.040 --> 07:27.680
Have a seat.

07:34.800 --> 07:38.800
-I'm leaving after New Year's.
-Where are you going?

07:39.760 --> 07:42.000
I don't know.

07:43.680 --> 07:46.720
But I can't stay here.

07:50.760 --> 07:55.080
-What will you do?
-I don't know, either.

07:55.160 --> 07:58.760
I think I'll keep the place open
a while longer.

08:00.240 --> 08:02.320
-With Liv?
-No, with Lasse.

08:03.120 --> 08:07.760
-What?
-It was his idea.

08:07.840 --> 08:11.280
I can't say I have anything
better to do.

08:11.360 --> 08:13.080
No...

08:14.240 --> 08:19.320
I talked to Rosén a while back,
about selling my share.

08:20.440 --> 08:23.800
But he's not interested
in just buying one third.

08:23.880 --> 08:27.320
No, I've thought about that.

08:27.400 --> 08:32.000
Can't you hold off until Lasse and I
get going? Then sell to us.

08:33.360 --> 08:38.800
I can't believe you're considering
going into business with him, Oskar.

08:38.880 --> 08:42.000
What does Liv say about it?

08:42.680 --> 08:45.720
Liv and I are getting divorced.

08:46.440 --> 08:48.080
What?

08:48.160 --> 08:52.160
It's a long story and I'd rather
not talk about it right now.

08:52.240 --> 08:57.800
But... let's think about it. Okay?

08:57.880 --> 09:02.720
Oskar, it's not about the money.
There's no hurry.

09:03.600 --> 09:06.640
But I think you're making
a huge mistake.

09:06.720 --> 09:09.560
You know what he's like.

09:35.360 --> 09:40.320
Great to see you again.
I heard a strange rumour.

09:40.400 --> 09:45.600
-Is it true you're quitting your job?
-Let's talk about that another time.

09:50.920 --> 09:56.680
I have some information that might
interest you, about the Waldemars.

09:58.280 --> 10:00.960
How about one more time?

10:01.720 --> 10:04.720
Can you do one more?

10:07.480 --> 10:10.120
I'll nail it this time.

10:10.200 --> 10:13.640
-Okay.
-One, two...

10:13.720 --> 10:16.000
Okay.

10:18.120 --> 10:21.360
If you could get the power,

10:21.440 --> 10:24.360
you would show the hate
you have for them,

10:24.440 --> 10:28.880
while I'm doing everything I
can to avenge our father...

10:28.960 --> 10:31.800
Shit, that's terrible!

10:33.320 --> 10:37.600
-It wasn't that bad.
-Yes, it was, Kim.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.400
Delete.

10:39.960 --> 10:42.320
Did you already send the film?

10:42.400 --> 10:46.880
-We have to go to the kitchen now.
-I'll never get this gig.

10:48.120 --> 10:51.440
I'll be stuck in that kitchen
until I die.

11:11.160 --> 11:13.320
-Hi there.
-Hi.

11:15.760 --> 11:21.320
-Home delivery?
-Yep, the police are service-minded.

11:31.800 --> 11:34.480
We've gotten some new information.

11:35.640 --> 11:39.560
-New information about what?
-About Konrad.

11:39.640 --> 11:43.600
Supposedly, he was obsessed
with Mauritz's disappearance.

11:43.680 --> 11:47.720
Maybe so. The body was never found.

11:47.800 --> 11:51.000
According to our new information,
Konrad found it.

11:51.440 --> 11:53.760
Mauritz's body?

11:53.840 --> 11:57.200
But he never reported
it to the police.

11:57.280 --> 12:00.040
Instead he blackmailed you.

12:01.400 --> 12:03.480
Why?

12:08.480 --> 12:11.200
That's just crazy.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.120
What really happened to Mauritz?

12:15.800 --> 12:19.720
Konrad was a delirious old drunk.

12:19.800 --> 12:25.440
You saw it yourself the other week.
His rants weren't based in fact.

12:25.520 --> 12:29.200
An old man's paranoid delusions.

12:30.280 --> 12:35.840
I have a witness. He blackmailed you.

12:35.920 --> 12:38.440
Why you?

12:38.520 --> 12:39.880
It can't be.

12:42.200 --> 12:45.240
Did you kill Konrad?

12:45.320 --> 12:48.760
I know who your witness is.

12:48.840 --> 12:54.360
It's Petra. I've known her
ever since we were kids.

12:54.440 --> 12:58.720
-She's a priest, but she's lying.
-Why would your best friend do that?

12:58.800 --> 13:01.960
To get back at me.

13:04.640 --> 13:07.520
We had an affair.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.560
And I betrayed her.

13:16.040 --> 13:21.240
What's really going on?
What do you suspect me of?

13:21.920 --> 13:26.480
You tested my guns.
I didn't shoot Konrad.

13:26.560 --> 13:29.560
You think you're safe.

13:29.640 --> 13:33.160
That you can keep on lying forever.

13:33.240 --> 13:35.520
But sooner or later,
it'll all come apart.

13:54.880 --> 13:56.840
Stay there.

14:02.760 --> 14:05.640
Hi.

14:06.120 --> 14:08.760
Did you come alone?

14:08.840 --> 14:11.240
Yeah, of course.

14:20.560 --> 14:24.600
-Have you told anyone I'm here?
-No, of course I haven't.

14:27.400 --> 14:32.200
-Are you okay? You seem a bit...
-Tired. I didn't get much sleep.

14:33.360 --> 14:35.920
Then you should try
to get some sleep now.

14:40.400 --> 14:43.160
And I will get you some dry clothes.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.160
She told them everything.

15:21.360 --> 15:23.280
Damn, Oskar...

15:24.480 --> 15:27.320
It wasn't supposed to be this way.

15:28.160 --> 15:29.560
How could she?

15:30.360 --> 15:34.560
I don't know.
I don't know how I could do it.

15:36.840 --> 15:42.360
Mum tried to tell me.
She tried to warn me about her.

15:42.800 --> 15:46.080
-Warn you about Liv?
-About Petra.

15:47.320 --> 15:53.240
Mum knew that Petra would tell the
police, that she would betray me.

15:53.320 --> 15:56.840
Did Petra go to the police?
And told them what?

15:57.360 --> 16:02.440
-About Konrad.
-Did you tell Petra? Are you crazy?

16:02.520 --> 16:07.440
I didn't say anything.
She has nothing.

16:07.520 --> 16:11.480
-No one can touch me.
-You have to talk to her.

16:11.560 --> 16:15.720
Go to Petra and find out what
she knows, so we can cover it up.

16:15.800 --> 16:18.840
Okay, I'll do it.

16:26.760 --> 16:30.000
Petra? Open the door.

16:30.920 --> 16:33.240
Petra!

16:46.800 --> 16:48.960
Petra?

16:49.920 --> 16:53.360
-You're too late.
-What?

16:53.440 --> 16:54.440
She's moved out.

16:58.160 --> 17:02.680
-When?
-I don't know, but she's left Åland.

17:04.240 --> 17:07.280
She was in a hurry to leave.

17:07.360 --> 17:10.800
She didn't even say goodbye.

17:10.880 --> 17:13.480
You're Oskar, right?

17:13.560 --> 17:17.320
And you're married to Liv...

17:21.800 --> 17:24.160
Yeah...

17:32.800 --> 17:38.800
-I thought you had the afternoon off.
-Yes, but there's no sign of Kim.

17:47.840 --> 17:50.120
I'm sorry.

17:51.040 --> 17:54.880
I'm sorry about how I
reacted earlier.

17:54.960 --> 17:58.480
It was just such a shock...

17:58.560 --> 18:02.360
I didn't mean to sound that harsh.

18:03.760 --> 18:06.200
I'm sorry about that.

18:09.560 --> 18:14.960
If you really want to keep it,
we can talk about it.

18:20.960 --> 18:24.000
I can make this work.

20:12.040 --> 20:14.240
-Hi.
-Hi.

20:18.520 --> 20:21.280
Dad, I need an advance.

20:21.360 --> 20:25.800
-Talk to Oskar.
-I did, but he said no.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.240
-How much do you need?
-One month's pay.

20:33.240 --> 20:36.880
-And you need that right now?
-Yeah.

20:36.960 --> 20:40.120
-What's the money for?
-Does it matter?

20:40.200 --> 20:42.680
-Can I have the money?
-Tell me what it's for.

20:42.760 --> 20:45.920
-Like you tell me everything?
-What do you want to know?

20:46.000 --> 20:51.040
If you're planning to fuck up your
life again, tell me so I can leave.

20:51.120 --> 20:54.040
I'm not letting you
drag me down with you.

20:54.120 --> 20:56.360
Kim!

20:59.600 --> 21:03.600
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Hi. Are you in your room?

21:03.680 --> 21:05.720
<i>Yeah, why?</i>

21:05.800 --> 21:06.960
Open the closet.

21:08.920 --> 21:12.440
-Why?
-Just do it.

21:12.520 --> 21:15.160
<i>Are you in the closet?</i>

21:22.280 --> 21:25.760
Okay, I don't quite know what to say.

21:27.760 --> 21:30.240
<i>I don't get wool socks every day.</i>

21:30.320 --> 21:33.720
Wear them tonight.
A taxi is picking you up after work.

21:34.120 --> 21:37.200
-What are we doing?
-You'll see.

21:38.640 --> 21:41.840
And hey, dress warmly.

21:42.480 --> 21:44.560
Okay. See you later.

21:45.200 --> 21:47.800
-See you.
<i>-Bye.</i>

22:03.200 --> 22:08.240
I've always been grateful to you,
Mum. I saw you as a protector.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.280
No one would find out what I did.

22:11.360 --> 22:16.280
No one would understand
or forgive a crime like that.

22:16.360 --> 22:20.680
How could you let me
carry such a secret?

22:20.760 --> 22:24.080
I was just a kid, Mum.

22:24.160 --> 22:27.000
You said you would protect me,
but you never protected me.

22:28.040 --> 22:32.880
You punished me, like a prisoner,
doomed to stay behind.

22:32.960 --> 22:35.680
Out of loyalty, out of guilt.

22:37.520 --> 22:40.360
You said I'd have it all.

22:40.440 --> 22:43.400
But I've lost everything.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.560
You never gave me a chance, Mum.

22:49.200 --> 22:55.040
I'm a free man now, Mum. What do you
think I should do with my freedom?

22:55.120 --> 22:58.080
Who are you talking to?

22:59.440 --> 23:03.280
-My mum.
-But she can't hear you.

23:09.800 --> 23:11.360
Olivia.

23:37.080 --> 23:38.440
There.

23:40.040 --> 23:43.200
Thank you, come back next year.

23:46.880 --> 23:49.520
-Is Oskar in the kitchen?
-No, he left.

23:49.600 --> 23:52.080
-Where to?
-No idea.

23:52.160 --> 23:56.160
-Have you seen Lasse?
-No, not lately.

23:56.240 --> 24:01.360
Then I'll have to celebrate on
my own. That's just as well.

24:06.800 --> 24:08.720
Cheers.

24:10.360 --> 24:12.600
Liv, come here.

24:19.440 --> 24:22.920
I thought we could toast
to a successful season.

24:24.400 --> 24:26.800
Oh, right. Hang on.

24:31.720 --> 24:35.520
-How about one of these?
-Okay.

24:35.600 --> 24:38.600
Never mind the glass.

24:40.280 --> 24:43.480
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

24:43.560 --> 24:47.320
Here's to hot tubs and schedules.

24:48.280 --> 24:50.480
And here's to...

24:52.000 --> 24:54.320
tradition and experience.

24:54.400 --> 24:57.120
Are you kidding me?

24:57.200 --> 24:59.920
-Cheers, dammit.
-Cheers.

25:07.560 --> 25:09.320
I'm sorry, I was just looking.

25:10.360 --> 25:12.680
I can't stay here anymore.
He'll find me.

25:15.160 --> 25:17.760
I have to leave.

25:18.800 --> 25:23.040
-I have to leave now.
-Andrus, sit down. It will be fine.

25:23.120 --> 25:26.640
The money will come in a few days
and I promise no one will come here.

25:26.720 --> 25:31.280
-Can you please trust me?
-Trust you? How can I do that?

25:31.680 --> 25:35.320
I don't even know you.
I'm completely isolated here.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.640
I don't know what's going on,
I'm stuck here.

25:37.720 --> 25:41.360
-You're safe here.
-Safe? You don't know that.

25:41.440 --> 25:42.840
There's people looking for me.

25:42.920 --> 25:46.080
What if they find me here and
I can't protect myself?

26:00.240 --> 26:02.360
Here.

26:12.960 --> 26:14.520
Feel better now?

26:15.880 --> 26:19.640
I'm just gonna go to work, and then
I'll come back and check on you, ok?

26:23.840 --> 26:25.920
Wait.

26:28.160 --> 26:30.400
-What are you doing?
-Where did you get this?

26:31.600 --> 26:35.800
-The gun! Where did you get it?
-I found it.

26:35.880 --> 26:38.600
-Did you find it on the boat?
-No.

26:38.680 --> 26:42.480
This is my gun. The last time
I saw it was on the boat.

26:42.960 --> 26:47.360
Where's the bag?
The bag with the money! Where is it?!

26:47.440 --> 26:49.240
I don't know what you're
talking about.

26:49.320 --> 26:52.080
Give me your phone.
Give me your phone!

27:01.000 --> 27:06.400
-Aren't you working today?
<i>-Dad, you have to come.</i>

27:06.480 --> 27:08.640
Kim, what's wrong?

27:08.720 --> 27:11.760
Just hurry here!

27:13.720 --> 27:15.720
Bring me the money.

27:15.800 --> 27:18.800
I said bring me the bag with
the money or I'll kill her.

27:30.960 --> 27:33.480
Damn!

27:39.520 --> 27:42.000
Why do you have a gun, Andrus?

27:42.080 --> 27:43.360
What do you think?

27:45.640 --> 27:48.800
I think you killed the man
that was found - Misha.

27:48.880 --> 27:52.520
-He shot me first.
-Why?

27:52.600 --> 27:56.360
He wanted to stop me from shooting
a flare gun on the goddamn boat.

27:56.440 --> 28:01.360
He didn't know I was armed, so he
shot me and threw me overboard.

28:01.440 --> 28:03.120
I don't know what happened to him.

28:04.440 --> 28:07.920
You lied to me the whole time.
You used me.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.840
You used me.

28:11.080 --> 28:14.800
You're just a fucking spoiled brat,
Kim.

28:14.880 --> 28:17.720
You never had a single problem
in your life.

28:17.800 --> 28:19.680
All of this was just an
adventure to you.

28:30.640 --> 28:34.880
-So you never liked me?
-No, I didn't. Stay back.

28:34.960 --> 28:37.760
And now you're gonna shoot me?

28:37.840 --> 28:40.240
If I have to.

28:41.520 --> 28:43.240
-I don't believe you.
-Kim!

28:43.320 --> 28:45.720
-Dad!
-Kim!

28:45.800 --> 28:49.520
-Stay the fuck back!
-Okay... Take it easy.

28:49.600 --> 28:51.680
-Dad, what the hell did you do?!
-Shut up!

28:52.760 --> 28:56.920
-It'll be fine, Kim. Take it easy.
-What the hell did you do, Dad?!

28:57.000 --> 29:01.320
Please don't hurt her.
I've got the money here, okay?

29:01.400 --> 29:05.320
-Where's the bag?
-This is all the money I've got left.

29:05.400 --> 29:07.760
The money in the bag was fake.

29:07.840 --> 29:12.000
-What do you mean fake?
-I'll do whatever you want.

29:12.080 --> 29:15.160
Just let her go, okay?

29:16.240 --> 29:19.240
-Give me a boat, I need a boat.
-Dad...

29:19.320 --> 29:23.760
Okay, okay. I'll get you the boat,
but you gotta let her go first, okay?

29:23.840 --> 29:28.960
No, no, no. You get me the boat,
and I'll think of letting her go.

29:29.040 --> 29:32.640
Okay, I'll get you the boat.
I'll give you the money.

29:32.720 --> 29:35.160
Slowly. Slowly!

29:53.040 --> 29:56.000
-Liv?
-Yeah?

29:57.880 --> 30:00.560
-Can you come with me?
-Why?

30:00.640 --> 30:02.960
Just come.

30:09.560 --> 30:12.320
-Well, what is it?
-Let's talk.

30:13.680 --> 30:16.320
-I'll tell you everything.
-I'm done talking today.

30:16.400 --> 30:21.720
If I'm to move on, Liv,
I have to explain myself.

30:21.800 --> 30:25.280
There can't be any
more secrets between us.

30:28.520 --> 30:32.680
I'll sign it, if you'll only listen.

30:56.840 --> 30:59.480
Kim, I'm...

31:01.960 --> 31:04.320
I'm sorry.

31:34.240 --> 31:37.840
I told Petra when Mom died.

31:38.720 --> 31:41.280
I couldn't bear it on my own.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.640
And you never considered telling me?

31:45.040 --> 31:49.640
No. I wasn't as afraid of losing her.

31:54.320 --> 31:57.840
I should have talked more. I could
have asked about Mauritz,

31:57.920 --> 31:59.840
I knew who he was.

31:59.920 --> 32:03.000
I didn't want to talk about him.

32:03.880 --> 32:07.160
I would have understood
if you'd told me.

32:07.240 --> 32:09.760
I was afraid that you'd despise me.

32:10.960 --> 32:14.160
The way you've looked at me lately,
that's what I've tried to avoid.

32:15.600 --> 32:20.760
-Is that why you're telling me now?
-I've lost everything I care about.

32:28.600 --> 32:31.560
My biggest regret...

32:31.640 --> 32:34.680
is that I never gave us
a real chance.

32:39.640 --> 32:40.640
I'm pregnant.

32:43.800 --> 32:45.720
What?

32:54.160 --> 32:55.360
It's not mine.

32:59.280 --> 33:01.640
Is it Lasse's?

33:26.120 --> 33:30.160
-I'm coming, Wille. I'm in the taxi.
<i>-Is this Jonna Waldemar?</i>

33:30.240 --> 33:33.440
<i>-Hi, sorry to interrupt your holiday.</i>
-No, it's okay.

33:33.520 --> 33:36.080
<i>We got a problem getting</i>
<i>in contact with your agent.</i>

33:36.160 --> 33:37.360
I have no agent.

33:37.440 --> 33:40.000
<i>Then you need to get one.</i>
<i>It's urgent.</i>

33:40.080 --> 33:41.120
Who is this?

33:41.200 --> 33:43.480
<i>Patricia Cross,</i>
<i>I'm the new producer.</i>

33:43.560 --> 33:47.400
<i>-The last one got fired.</i>
-Okay, I don't understand.

33:47.480 --> 33:51.560
<i>-You got the part. You're in.</i>
-I'm in?

33:51.640 --> 33:56.600
<i>Yeah, we'll sort out all the details</i>
<i>after New Year's. Merry Christmas.</i>

33:56.680 --> 33:59.640
Okay, Merry Christmas.

34:07.480 --> 34:10.040
Yes!

34:11.280 --> 34:14.280
Yes! Oh my god!

34:14.360 --> 34:15.840
I'm sorry!

34:41.360 --> 34:44.040
-Hi.
-Hi.

34:46.800 --> 34:49.760
-Thanks.
-Welcome.

35:01.080 --> 35:04.160
-Did you do this?
-Yes.

35:22.480 --> 35:24.840
<i>Oskar.</i>

35:25.560 --> 35:27.640
<i>Oskar.</i>

35:28.960 --> 35:30.440
<i>Oskar, come to me, Oskar.</i>

35:33.080 --> 35:35.600
<i>Oskar.</i>

35:35.680 --> 35:39.000
<i>Oskar, come to me, Oskar.</i>

35:39.480 --> 35:41.840
<i>Come.</i>

35:41.920 --> 35:44.600
<i>Oskar.</i>

35:46.000 --> 35:48.320
<i>Oskar.</i>

35:49.960 --> 35:52.400
<i>Oskar, come to me.</i>

35:56.120 --> 35:59.560
Please don't drink any more.

35:59.640 --> 36:02.280
Come, I'll take you home.

36:02.360 --> 36:05.400
I don't want Cecilia to
see me like this.

36:05.480 --> 36:08.040
She knows we're getting divorced.

36:08.120 --> 36:14.000
She knew there was something going
on, I couldn't keep lying to her.

36:14.080 --> 36:16.720
-Okay.
-Come on.

36:17.760 --> 36:19.880
Come...

36:26.200 --> 36:29.120
I'm so very sorry.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.440
It just happened.
It wasn't something we planned.

36:33.520 --> 36:37.480
Oskar, you have to forgive me.

36:37.560 --> 36:40.360
Do you hear me?

36:40.440 --> 36:43.960
You should love your neighbour
as yourself.

36:44.040 --> 36:46.760
But I can't, Liv.

36:46.840 --> 36:49.720
I can't do it.

37:25.720 --> 37:29.520
-I'll stay until you fall asleep.
-You don't need to do that.

37:29.600 --> 37:32.760
Yes, I need to.

37:38.960 --> 37:41.560
Why didn't you say something?

37:41.640 --> 37:42.840
Don't you trust me?

37:44.000 --> 37:48.440
Like you trust me? Do you want
to talk about secrets now?

37:48.520 --> 37:52.400
Andrus was only here because of you!

37:52.480 --> 37:55.600
You got me caught up in this!
It's all your fault!

37:55.680 --> 37:59.200
I know. I know.

38:04.600 --> 38:08.280
Whatever you want to do now,
we'll do it.

38:08.360 --> 38:13.920
So you're making me decide
whether you go to prison or not?

38:21.320 --> 38:22.560
Were you in love with him?

38:24.320 --> 38:26.400
Why do you ask?

38:26.480 --> 38:28.960
I'm sorry.

38:29.880 --> 38:34.760
If I had any feelings for him,
they're long gone now.

38:36.400 --> 38:38.880
What about you?

38:40.440 --> 38:41.280
What?

38:41.840 --> 38:45.480
Cecilia told me Oskar
and Liv are getting divorced.

38:46.320 --> 38:49.880
Their divorce has nothing to do
with me.

38:53.760 --> 38:56.520
You guys go on ahead.

38:57.360 --> 39:00.080
I'll get her.

39:01.440 --> 39:05.680
What could be more important
than mulled wine right now?

39:05.760 --> 39:11.360
-Nothing, just some police work.
-More pointless ballistics tests?

39:12.200 --> 39:14.760
-I'll be there soon.
-Or now?

39:14.840 --> 39:17.280
Or soon.

39:17.360 --> 39:18.800
Okay.

39:27.400 --> 39:32.080
-Are you trying to get me drunk?
-You're managing that on your own.

39:36.080 --> 39:37.480
What is this place?

39:39.600 --> 39:43.760
I had some time to spare
and so I did this for you.

39:50.840 --> 39:54.400
I've done some bad things.

39:55.040 --> 39:58.120
Things I'm not proud of.

39:59.240 --> 40:01.240
But I'm not hiding anything.

40:04.040 --> 40:08.240
I want you to know who I am,
so you won't be disappointed.

40:13.800 --> 40:15.960
There are...

40:17.000 --> 40:21.160
There are things I want
to tell you too.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.360
But...

40:25.120 --> 40:28.120
I need to do things
at my own pace.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.760
Did I tear off the button?

40:46.720 --> 40:50.120
I don't know. Probably.

41:10.320 --> 41:11.840
Lasse.

41:11.920 --> 41:14.360
<i>-Hi, it's Laura.</i>
-Hi.

41:14.440 --> 41:18.320
-How are you?
<i>-I'm fine.</i>

41:19.080 --> 41:22.280
<i>Have you gotten everything</i>
<i>ready for tomorrow?</i>

41:22.360 --> 41:25.760
-Tomorrow?
-It's Christmas Eve tomorrow.

41:25.840 --> 41:29.360
Right... yeah, sure.

41:29.440 --> 41:33.800
I've been thinking and...

41:33.880 --> 41:36.080
I'm sorry about what happened
last time.

41:36.160 --> 41:41.240
<i>You need to know that you</i>
<i>can talk to me, if you need to.</i>

41:41.320 --> 41:44.560
<i>I want to help you, Lasse, I...</i>

41:44.640 --> 41:47.600
If you ask me, I'll help you.

41:47.680 --> 41:52.960
That's nice of you, but I don't know
what you mean. I don't need any help.

41:54.080 --> 41:57.760
I'm calling as a friend,
not as a police officer.

41:57.840 --> 42:01.000
<i>Is there anything you</i>
<i>want to tell me?</i>

42:02.320 --> 42:04.440
No.

42:05.080 --> 42:08.320
Okay. Merry Christmas.

42:08.400 --> 42:10.760
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>
