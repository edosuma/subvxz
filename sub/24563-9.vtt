where they were going?

My son.

12:19.521 --> 12:21.697
Yes. Lloyd.

12:23.351 --> 12:26.571
[Lord Garmadon]
'Then bring him to me.'

12:26.658 --> 12:30.358
I won't have to.
He will come.

12:39.236 --> 12:41.412
That's odd.
Who locked the navigation?

12:41.499 --> 12:44.154
Oh, there you are, Nya.
The guys wanna talk downstairs.

12:44.241 --> 12:46.461
Uh, give me a minute.
I just have to unlock this.

12:46.548 --> 12:48.506
It can wait.
P.I.X.A.L. has a plan.

12:48.593 --> 12:50.334
You're gonna wanna hear this.

12:54.948 --> 12:57.559
I know it's tough to take
a backseat on this one.

12:57.646 --> 12:59.604
I get it.
We can't be impulsive.

12:59.691 --> 13:01.781
We don't want this
to spiral into anything worse.

13:03.739 --> 13:05.567
Okay, Nya, so what's your plan?

13:05.654 --> 13:07.656
My plan?
I thought it was P.I.X.A.L.'s.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.964
[gasps]

13:11.051 --> 13:12.487
[Nya]
'Lloyd, what are you doing?'

13:12.574 --> 13:14.576
I'm sorry.
I have to confront him.

13:14.663 --> 13:16.970
- I have to face him.
- No, you can't.

13:17.057 --> 13:18.623
Come on, boy,
it could be a trap.

13:18.710 --> 13:20.930
Yeah, I mean, hey,
we can talk it over.

13:21.017 --> 13:23.063
- We'll figure it out.
- I'm sorry, guys.

13:23.150 --> 13:25.543
It's something I have to do
alone.

13:25.630 --> 13:27.719
- Lloyd, stop!
- Don't do this!

13:27.807 --> 13:29.634
- Lloyd, come back!
- Ugh!

13:29.721 --> 13:32.028
[grunting]

13:32.115 --> 13:34.988
[intense music]

13:40.863 --> 13:42.560
[engine revving]

13:47.043 --> 13:51.265
- 'You don't have to do this.'
- 'What would Wu do?'

13:51.352 --> 13:52.440
[Zane]
'This isn't you..'

13:54.921 --> 13:57.837
[dramatic music]

14:27.388 --> 14:29.259
[grunting]

14:31.740 --> 14:34.047
Stand back, guys.

14:34.134 --> 14:35.439
[grunts]

14:37.702 --> 14:39.008
Come on.

14:43.230 --> 14:44.753
[Cole]
He's in his car.

14:44.840 --> 14:46.842
He's heading towards
Kryptarium Prison.

14:46.929 --> 14:49.932
[grunts]
I-I can't change course.

14:50.019 --> 14:51.542
He has locked the navigation.

14:51.629 --> 14:53.718
Zane, find a way
to override it.

14:56.634 --> 14:58.462
vroom

15:00.987 --> 15:03.380
The Green Ninja's coming alone.

15:05.252 --> 15:07.776
- Don't do this.
- I'm not in the mood to talk.

15:07.863 --> 15:09.082
This ends now.

15:09.169 --> 15:11.084
No, Lloyd, this doesn't end now.

15:11.171 --> 15:13.608
It's a two-way frequency.
Come on, buddy.

15:15.697 --> 15:17.481
[Cole]
'Can't get rid of us
that easily.'

15:17.568 --> 15:18.961
[grunts]

15:19.048 --> 15:20.267
[glass shatters]

15:27.448 --> 15:29.276
boom

15:36.326 --> 15:39.721
Father, come out and face me!

15:41.027 --> 15:42.724
Do you want us to deal with him?

15:42.811 --> 15:44.639
No.

15:44.726 --> 15:46.858
Are these cameras
on a closed channel?

15:46.946 --> 15:48.730
They don't have to be.

15:48.817 --> 15:51.124
Broadcast it to the world.

15:51.211 --> 15:54.866
Let them see
what true power looks like.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.173
[both chuckle]

16:02.918 --> 16:05.834
[indistinct chatter]

16:11.013 --> 16:13.581
Hey, daddy, look,
it's the Green Ninja.

16:13.668 --> 16:15.583
Ugh, that should do it.

16:15.670 --> 16:17.759
We've regained control
of navigation.

16:19.413 --> 16:22.111
Hey, what's with Lloyd
on the TV?

16:22.198 --> 16:25.071
Harumi. She wants us to watch.

16:25.158 --> 16:27.029
[intense music]

16:28.857 --> 16:29.945
[door closes]

16:30.032 --> 16:31.903
[Lord Garmadon grunting]

16:31.991 --> 16:36.517
- 'It was foolish to come here.'
- Show yourself, father.

16:39.911 --> 16:42.131
[growls]

16:42.218 --> 16:46.179
You, you've changed.

16:46.266 --> 16:47.876
So have you.

16:47.963 --> 16:49.791
I don't wanna have to fight you.

16:49.878 --> 16:52.185
[grunting]

16:55.275 --> 16:57.320
Please, this isn't you.

16:57.407 --> 16:59.018
This is the new me.

16:59.105 --> 17:00.845
[laughing]

17:04.153 --> 17:06.503
You have power.

17:06.590 --> 17:08.244
[grunting]

17:11.421 --> 17:13.293
I didn't come to fight you.

17:15.947 --> 17:18.602
My father's somewhere in there.

17:18.689 --> 17:20.169
I've saved you once.

17:21.649 --> 17:23.564
I'll save you again.

17:23.651 --> 17:27.002
There is nothing left to save!

17:27.089 --> 17:28.047
Ugh!

17:30.136 --> 17:31.789
[grunts]

17:31.876 --> 17:34.923
I've played many roles.

17:35.010 --> 17:36.751
[grunting]

17:39.884 --> 17:43.323
Worn many masks.

17:43.410 --> 17:44.585
Father.

17:44.672 --> 17:45.890
[grunts]

17:45.977 --> 17:48.415
- Husband.
- Ugh!

17:48.502 --> 17:50.460
Brother.

17:50.547 --> 17:52.419
- Teacher.
- Yah!

17:54.421 --> 17:57.859
But only one was summoned back.

17:57.946 --> 17:59.252
[grunts]

18:00.775 --> 18:03.952
- Aah!
- Destroyer!

18:04.039 --> 18:05.649
[grunting]

18:05.736 --> 18:08.130
[dramatic music]

18:12.265 --> 18:14.702
It's the fight that fuels it.

18:14.789 --> 18:18.227
He's finding it,
his true potential.

18:18.314 --> 18:20.403
[all gasping]

18:24.407 --> 18:25.713
Get us there.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.715
[intense music]

18:31.719 --> 18:33.329
But listen to me.

18:33.416 --> 18:35.070
You don't have to do this.

18:35.157 --> 18:37.551
Harumi is using you as a pawn.

18:37.638 --> 18:39.857
You are the pawn.

18:39.944 --> 18:43.252
A pawn to your own foolishness.

18:44.253 --> 18:46.342
[grunting]

18:49.040 --> 18:50.738
[groans]

18:50.825 --> 18:53.001
[all gasping]

18:53.088 --> 18:55.221
Get up, son, get up.

18:55.308 --> 18:58.180
[grunting]

19:10.279 --> 19:11.672
[screams]

19:11.759 --> 19:13.456
[gasping]

19:16.807 --> 19:19.723
[grunting]

19:20.855 --> 19:23.249
[intense music]

19:53.322 --> 19:56.195
[grunting]

20:08.990 --> 20:10.687
Ah!

20:10.774 --> 20:13.081
You wouldn't hurt me.

20:13.168 --> 20:14.343
Your son.

20:14.430 --> 20:16.737
I have no son.

20:19.435 --> 20:20.610
[grunts]

20:20.697 --> 20:22.482
[screams]

20:25.572 --> 20:28.052
[screaming]

20:38.541 --> 20:40.717
[indistinct chatter]

20:45.113 --> 20:48.029
[instrumental music]

20:56.646 --> 20:57.908
[sighs]

21:01.608 --> 21:03.740
Ah, the streets are in fear.

21:03.827 --> 21:07.048
Everyone saw Lord Garmadon
defeat his son.

21:07.135 --> 21:11.313
We'll let him live
to see his father's reign.

21:11.400 --> 21:15.578
Gather everyone.
We ride to the city at dawn.

21:15.665 --> 21:19.539
It's time Ninjago meets
their new emperor.

21:19.626 --> 21:22.498
'Emperor Garmadon.'

21:22.585 --> 21:24.892
[evil laughter]

21:27.547 --> 21:29.897
[gasping]

21:39.472 --> 21:40.951
Father.

21:46.261 --> 21:49.177
[theme music]
