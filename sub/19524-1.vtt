00:58.259 --> 01:00.259
- No.

01:00.261 --> 01:01.693
No.

03:16.229 --> 03:18.330
- What's the matter?

03:35.782 --> 03:38.817
- What?

03:38.819 --> 03:41.853
- Why are you not
eating anything?

03:41.855 --> 03:43.855
- I've never been crazy
about the food here.

03:43.857 --> 03:45.958
You know that.

03:46.926 --> 03:49.628
- I would have taken you
to my uncle peaches' place.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.330
I told you that on the way here.

03:51.332 --> 03:53.966
- This is the only place
you ever take me,

03:53.968 --> 03:55.634
and every time you tell me

03:55.636 --> 03:58.537
about how you used to come here
with your mother

03:58.539 --> 04:01.773
and your grandmother
when you were a kid,

04:01.775 --> 04:05.744
back when you were a shoobie
and the seat cushions were blue.

04:09.550 --> 04:14.987
Okay, so you're not as excited
about the remodel as I am.

04:14.989 --> 04:16.788
You don't have to get nasty.

04:16.790 --> 04:21.360
- I'm not excited
about anything anymore, Eddie.

04:21.362 --> 04:23.462
What are we doing?

04:25.565 --> 04:27.666
- What's your problem?

04:29.569 --> 04:35.540
- This town, the w-way
we live, everything.

04:40.580 --> 04:43.382
- This is where
you're from, Sandra.

04:43.384 --> 04:45.484
This is your home.

04:58.498 --> 05:02.834
- I've been thinking a lot about
when we first got together.

05:02.836 --> 05:07.873
- We had a lot of good times.
- It was more than that for me.

05:10.877 --> 05:12.744
You were larger
than life, Eddie.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.479
You're better than this.

05:14.481 --> 05:18.717
I'm sitting here waiting
for that guy to show back up.

05:18.719 --> 05:22.487
Somewhere along the line,
something changed.

05:25.525 --> 05:27.059
- Listen...

05:32.498 --> 05:36.501
I know that things
have been rough

05:36.503 --> 05:40.572
since we lost the apartment,

05:40.574 --> 05:45.110
and we both know
that was my fault.

05:45.112 --> 05:48.046
You don't think I want things
to be better for us?

05:48.048 --> 05:50.048
- Then why won't you call
your cousin Dominick?

05:50.050 --> 05:51.883
- Why!
- Because he could get you back

05:51.885 --> 05:56.054
in the carpenter's union
in, like, two minutes.

05:56.056 --> 05:59.791
- And then I could be
like my cousin?

05:59.793 --> 06:03.962
Carry a lunch pail to work,
punch a clock?

06:03.964 --> 06:06.698
He's a strunz, my cousin.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.700
Strunz!

06:57.483 --> 06:59.751
- Good luck, gentlemen,
this hand.

07:04.490 --> 07:06.124
Twenty.

07:06.126 --> 07:08.727
- I ain't complaining.
- Look at this shit.

07:08.729 --> 07:12.130
- Sixteen... split 'em?
- Split 'em, split.

07:12.132 --> 07:16.635
- 3,000, sir.
- 3,000. Look at this.

07:16.637 --> 07:20.872
3,000.
- Ooh, big shot, look at him.

07:20.874 --> 07:23.575
- Playing for another 3,000.

07:23.577 --> 07:27.179
Good luck this round.

07:27.181 --> 07:29.815
Eighteen.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.616
Eighteen.

07:31.618 --> 07:34.986
Thirteen.
Nineteen.

07:37.757 --> 07:39.758
Twenty.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.693
- All right, all right.
- Like that?

07:41.695 --> 07:43.495
- That's... that's a tough one,
buddy.

07:43.497 --> 07:46.131
- Hey. Can't win them all, man.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.467
Only rocky marciano.
- How about that answer?

07:48.469 --> 07:50.969
- Hey, how about that?
- Yeah, very funny.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.571
- I am.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.773
- My apologies.

07:54.775 --> 07:56.775
- It's the second time
in two weeks.

07:56.777 --> 08:00.178
Last week same shit.
He's cheating me. He's cheating.

08:00.180 --> 08:02.113
- Nobody's trying to
cheat you, relax.

08:02.115 --> 08:03.615
- I'm a dues-paying member
in this joint.

08:03.617 --> 08:05.150
- We all are.
- We all pay the dues,

08:05.152 --> 08:07.686
and you know what, you just paid
some more dues just then.

08:07.688 --> 08:10.088
Relax.
- Ease back, Eddie.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.823
- No shame. You got
to split eights.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.525
- Come on, calm down.
- "Split eights"...

08:13.527 --> 08:15.193
- It's a friendly game.

08:15.195 --> 08:17.963
- Looks like you're out now.
- Yeah, you see that?

08:17.965 --> 08:20.065
Yeah, I am out.
Give me a marker.

08:20.067 --> 08:22.767
- What's your pleasure Mr. m.?
- Ten.

08:22.769 --> 08:25.170
- 10,000?
- No, ten dollars.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.572
Yes, 10,000.
- He's a wise guy.

08:27.574 --> 08:29.508
Would you relax?

08:34.947 --> 08:37.215
- Sir, you're good for
$5,000 tonight.

08:37.217 --> 08:39.683
- 5,000?
- Sir, that's your balance.

08:39.686 --> 08:42.053
- Angelo, are you nuts? It's bad
enough this motherfucker

08:42.054 --> 08:43.822
is robbing me all night!
- Oh! Relax.

08:43.823 --> 08:46.024
- Are you fucking nuts?!
Are you fucking nuts?!

08:46.026 --> 08:47.859
- Get him out of here!
- What the fuck?!

08:47.861 --> 08:49.661
- Hey! Get your fucking hands
off me.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.563
- See you next week, Eddie.
- Yeah, I'll see all

08:51.565 --> 08:53.532
you motherfuckers next week.
- Tell a friend!

08:53.534 --> 08:55.233
- Fuck all of you.
I'll see you next week.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.769
I'll see you next week!

10:00.299 --> 10:02.167
- You're slipping, Giancarlo.

10:02.169 --> 10:06.037
I could have capped you
right here.

10:06.039 --> 10:10.141
- Tony, Jesus. You scared me.

10:13.312 --> 10:17.215
- Rough night?

10:17.217 --> 10:20.118
- Rough month.
- How many times I've got

10:20.120 --> 10:23.355
to tell you to take it easy
with that booze?

10:23.357 --> 10:27.726
Moderation.
It's going to kill you,

10:27.728 --> 10:31.930
but you don't want
to hear that, do you?

10:31.932 --> 10:34.799
- I'll take it under advisement.
- Come on. Let's walk.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.168
Let's talk.

10:37.170 --> 10:40.639
- Hey, thanks for coming again.
- That's what friends are for.

10:48.347 --> 10:50.649
- Too many ears.

10:55.921 --> 10:59.124
You know about the poker game
in my house on Wednesday nights?

10:59.126 --> 11:00.692
- Mm-hmm.

11:00.694 --> 11:03.361
- This guy had a really
bad night last week.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.330
He's in to me for 100 grand.

11:05.332 --> 11:08.166
I graciously gave him
a couple extra days.

11:08.168 --> 11:11.770
Now the prick won't even return
my phone calls.

11:11.772 --> 11:14.873
- Okay, what guy?

11:14.875 --> 11:18.810
- Your pop's buddy from
the gang from Philly.

11:18.812 --> 11:21.713
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.
Hold on.

11:21.715 --> 11:24.683
You want me to go back home?

11:24.685 --> 11:28.119
Ton, you know
you have my loyalty,

11:28.121 --> 11:30.989
but I can't go home,
and you know that.

11:30.991 --> 11:33.792
- Still?
- Yeah, still.

11:35.428 --> 11:38.830
- You worried about those
knuckleheads from way back when?

11:38.832 --> 11:40.398
- Let me ask you a question,

11:40.400 --> 11:42.834
what does never set foot here
again mean to you?

11:42.836 --> 11:46.337
To me, it means don't go back,
so I haven't.

11:46.339 --> 11:49.441
- I've got your back
going there.

11:49.443 --> 11:53.478
Don't even think that thing
ever happened.

11:53.480 --> 11:57.482
Look, this guy has known you
since you were a kid.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.350
Maybe you can get him
to understand

11:59.352 --> 12:01.419
the seriousness
of the situation.

12:08.928 --> 12:11.362
- All right,
I'll take care of it.

12:11.364 --> 12:13.765
- You know where his bar
is at, right?

12:13.767 --> 12:16.935
- Yeah, I know where he's at.
- He probably closed it down

12:16.937 --> 12:19.804
a few times
back in the day, right?

12:19.806 --> 12:22.340
- A few.
- I want you to go there,

12:22.342 --> 12:23.975
wait for him,

12:23.977 --> 12:27.746
when he's closing tomorrow
night, you follow?

12:27.748 --> 12:29.514
If he don't cooperate with you,

12:29.516 --> 12:31.516
you rough him up
however you need to,

12:31.518 --> 12:35.887
but don't walk out of there
without my money, you got me?

12:35.889 --> 12:37.922
He's got a safe
on the second floor.

12:37.924 --> 12:41.993
Blow the motherfucker up, I
don't care, but I want my money.

12:44.930 --> 12:48.767
- I got you covered.
- Bastard's making it really

12:48.769 --> 12:51.836
difficult for me
to make payroll this week.

13:22.234 --> 13:24.335
- Salut.

13:35.381 --> 13:38.016
- You remember that
Marina job two years ago?

13:40.586 --> 13:44.122
- Who could forget that?

13:44.124 --> 13:47.225
- "In and out, 10 grand apiece."

13:47.227 --> 13:50.995
Those were Tony's
exact words to us.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.567
- How we're both not sitting
in prison cells

13:55.569 --> 13:58.570
right now over that deal?

13:58.572 --> 14:01.606
- I got pneumonia
hiding in that water.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.875
I'm still not right over it.

14:08.480 --> 14:12.150
- Well, this job is on dry land.

14:14.253 --> 14:16.855
Restaurant owner in Philly,

14:16.857 --> 14:19.190
used to be good buddies
with my pop,

14:19.192 --> 14:21.392
owes Tony 100 big ones.

14:21.394 --> 14:25.163
He's giving Tony the runaround.

14:25.165 --> 14:28.233
- What aren't you telling me?

14:28.235 --> 14:31.436
- It's got to get done tonight.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.173
- What if he doesn't have
the cash?

14:35.175 --> 14:37.208
What if he's not there?

14:37.210 --> 14:39.878
You know how crazy Tony gets
when things don't go right.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.881
- Look, the time to get him
is when

14:42.883 --> 14:44.315
he's getting ready
to close up shop.

14:44.317 --> 14:45.917
That's our time.

14:48.888 --> 14:52.023
You still got the,
uh, bat right?

14:52.025 --> 14:56.127
- Yeah, what do I need it for?

15:08.274 --> 15:10.308
- Christ.

15:17.683 --> 15:19.217
- Terry.

15:24.056 --> 15:28.026
Be a pal, keep your hands
where I can see them.

15:32.064 --> 15:34.332
Both of them.

15:40.339 --> 15:44.142
- Eddie.

15:44.144 --> 15:45.710
Is that you?

15:45.712 --> 15:49.681
- I got the stairs.

15:52.685 --> 15:55.019
Collecting for
"the one and only," Terry.

15:55.021 --> 15:57.488
He wants his money.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.457
- And he sent you out for it?

16:01.160 --> 16:04.228
I'll be gobsmacked.

16:04.230 --> 16:08.399
You know, if your father
was still alive,

16:08.401 --> 16:10.668
he'd be smacking you around
for even coming round here.

16:12.204 --> 16:14.472
- I don't want to be here
right now.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.040
I'm here 'cause I got to be.

16:16.042 --> 16:20.144
You had a bad night and you owe.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.714
- You... you tell that
son of a bitch

16:22.716 --> 16:24.983
that I'll bring his money round

16:24.985 --> 16:28.386
to him first thing
tomorrow morning, swear to god.

16:28.388 --> 16:34.525
But for tonight, I'm about to be
in the middle of something,

16:34.527 --> 16:36.761
and for the love of Jesus,
you can't be here.

16:40.599 --> 16:43.201
I...

16:43.203 --> 16:46.170
You little piss ant
piece of shit.

16:46.172 --> 16:47.739
- What was that?

16:51.010 --> 16:53.111
- I'll give you what I've got.

16:56.281 --> 16:59.250
Jesus.

17:01.087 --> 17:03.054
Here goes my last ever,
swear to god.

17:08.627 --> 17:12.262
It's 50,000 or 60,000.

17:12.265 --> 17:14.365
I don't really know.

17:18.436 --> 17:21.406
So, all righty then.

17:21.407 --> 17:24.142
It was good to see you there,
Eddie,

17:24.144 --> 17:26.243
and...

17:29.048 --> 17:31.249
-not going to get it done.

17:33.318 --> 17:37.388
- Oh, well, now...

17:37.390 --> 17:40.324
Where am I going
to get another $50,000?

17:40.326 --> 17:44.595
I've got an idea...
The fucking bank,

17:44.597 --> 17:46.697
which isn't fucking open.

17:50.769 --> 17:53.304
You know, your father
and I, we used to play

17:53.306 --> 17:55.773
a good many years together.
I mean...

17:55.775 --> 17:58.109
I held you in my arms
when you were a wee little lad.

17:58.111 --> 18:00.111
You were still puking
and mewling

18:00.113 --> 18:02.547
and shittin' your little
nappies.

18:02.549 --> 18:04.782
Gah!
- You listen to me.

18:04.784 --> 18:07.585
If I go back down there
without 100,

18:07.587 --> 18:09.587
then your problem
becomes my problem.

18:09.589 --> 18:10.822
Ain't going to happen.

18:10.824 --> 18:13.591
- Be reasonable here, boyo!

18:13.593 --> 18:16.227
For god sakes,
I took you fucking fishing!

18:16.229 --> 18:20.231
- Yeah, and we didn't catch
shit, did we?!

18:22.102 --> 18:25.603
- I told you back then you were
using the wrong fucking lure.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.341
- What the hell is that?

18:30.343 --> 18:33.678
- I don't know.
I'm not expecting anyone.

18:43.489 --> 18:46.324
- Mr. mcgann?
- Help me, for fuck's sake!

18:55.167 --> 18:59.504
Now, boyo, now stay calm!

19:31.403 --> 19:33.905
- You all right, man?

19:35.607 --> 19:38.743
Chris?
- Huh?

19:39.711 --> 19:41.812
- Empty his pockets.

19:48.720 --> 19:50.221
Go ahead, do it.

19:50.223 --> 19:52.523
- Yeah.

22:19.838 --> 22:22.773
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:36.488 --> 22:39.357
- Okay, so what's
the big mystery here?

22:39.359 --> 22:41.125
- So this.

23:00.679 --> 23:04.815
- Are you friggin' kidding me?

23:04.817 --> 23:06.617
- Nope.

23:11.790 --> 23:14.692
- I can't even begin to figure
out how many carats this is.

23:21.466 --> 23:24.435
Color and clarity
are good, real good.

23:25.771 --> 23:28.706
Probably si1 or 2 when it's cut,
somewhere in there.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.109
- So how much do you think
it's worth?

23:34.679 --> 23:36.714
- Millions.

23:38.851 --> 23:41.919
- You know what this is?

23:41.921 --> 23:45.890
This is our road
out of this shitty life.

23:47.092 --> 23:51.896
- Maybe, but first we've got
to fence that thing.

23:51.898 --> 23:53.998
That ain't going
to be easy, my friend.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.834
Whoever owned that is definitely
going to be coming for it.

23:56.836 --> 23:58.836
They probably already are.

23:58.838 --> 24:01.472
- Yeah.
Imagine how pissed they are.

24:01.474 --> 24:03.974
Plus, Tony's probably got his
crews out looking for us.

24:11.083 --> 24:13.184
- Yeah, talk to me.

24:14.586 --> 24:16.720
He did what?

24:16.722 --> 24:18.489
No, no, no.

24:18.491 --> 24:21.759
Don't worry about Eddie.

24:21.761 --> 24:24.528
You find his boy,
Christian Flynn.

24:24.530 --> 24:26.096
Leave Eddie to me.

24:34.739 --> 24:37.708
- You're going to have
to change motel rooms.

24:37.710 --> 24:41.846
- Yeah, yeah, we will.

24:50.589 --> 24:53.624
It's got to be Victor
on something like this.

24:53.626 --> 24:55.993
- No, man, no, not Victor.

24:55.995 --> 24:58.996
Can't we just call the guys up
in lehigh valley,

24:58.998 --> 25:01.031
the, uh, the Russians?

25:02.601 --> 25:05.102
- This is way too big for them,
what are you, nuts?

25:05.104 --> 25:06.770
Way too big.

25:06.772 --> 25:10.040
- Fine, but not Victor.

25:10.042 --> 25:14.111
Man, he screws us
every freakin' time.

25:15.914 --> 25:18.916
- He's expensive,
I'll give you that,

25:18.918 --> 25:21.185
but he's always had my back.

25:21.187 --> 25:25.756
- No, no,<i> I</i> have always
had your back.

25:25.758 --> 25:30.594
He plays that fake
father figure bullshit

25:30.596 --> 25:34.265
to a t, and every time,
I watch him screw you over.

25:34.267 --> 25:36.734
- He's the only one in the city

25:36.736 --> 25:39.169
that can get a deal
like this done,

25:39.171 --> 25:41.272
and we both know it.

25:42.974 --> 25:45.776
- Fine, fine, whatever,
it's your call,

25:45.778 --> 25:47.678
but I don't like it.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.813
- Look at this thing.
What are you worried about?

25:49.815 --> 25:51.916
This is going to be
the easiest damn money

25:51.918 --> 25:53.751
we ever made in our life.

25:53.753 --> 25:55.786
The easiest. Are you kidding me?

25:55.788 --> 25:59.256
- All right, we got this.
- We got this.

25:59.258 --> 26:01.258
I can't believe it.

26:20.045 --> 26:22.212
- Can I ask you a question?
- Just one.

26:22.214 --> 26:25.082
- Why are you so cranky?
- Do you guys get the paper?

26:25.084 --> 26:27.151
You read the paper every day
or do you just read the comics?

26:27.153 --> 26:28.586
You see what the price
of gold is?

26:28.588 --> 26:30.054
- Who gets a newspaper anymore?

26:30.056 --> 26:31.855
- Don't you see what
the price of gold is today?

26:31.857 --> 26:34.858
- I don't give a shit about
gold, what gold's doing, okay?

26:34.860 --> 26:38.095
- Look, Eddie, let's just take
this up the street, huh?

26:39.297 --> 26:40.965
- You want to?
- Yeah.

26:40.967 --> 26:42.700
- Maybe we should.

26:42.702 --> 26:45.135
- Hey, hey, both you guys,

26:45.137 --> 26:46.937
hugs and kisses,
I'll see you later.

26:46.939 --> 26:49.607
Okay? Bye-bye.
Go ahead.

26:49.609 --> 26:51.775
- Come on.
Stop, stop.

26:54.012 --> 26:56.013
We'll see if we can get
this crankiness

26:56.015 --> 26:59.016
turned around, all right?
- It all depends, go ahead.

26:59.018 --> 27:03.320
- In this pouch... score
of your life, check it out.

27:03.322 --> 27:05.889
- You know, you guys
are killing me here.

27:05.891 --> 27:07.324
I don't deal dope.

27:07.326 --> 27:09.393
Get out of my shop
with this pouch, come on.

27:09.395 --> 27:11.261
- Victor, it's not dope.

27:11.263 --> 27:13.731
Just open it and have a look.

27:13.733 --> 27:17.301
- Open it? Okay, I'll open it.

27:22.907 --> 27:24.875
Oh, my god.

27:24.877 --> 27:28.646
- Okay, you happier now?
- Wow, wow, wow, wow, boys.

27:28.648 --> 27:30.314
You got something here.

27:30.316 --> 27:32.216
This can't be real, can it?

27:32.218 --> 27:34.318
- Why don't you put it on
the scale and weigh it.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.919
You know it's real.

27:35.921 --> 27:37.788
- Let's see what
the scale says, gentlemen.

27:40.225 --> 27:42.926
It says that's worth
about $15 million.

27:42.928 --> 27:45.329
Huh?

27:45.331 --> 27:47.297
Where'd you boys find this?

27:47.299 --> 27:49.199
This doesn't just
appear out of nowhere.

27:49.201 --> 27:50.834
Huh?

27:50.836 --> 27:52.236
- It belongs to me
and Christian now.

27:52.238 --> 27:54.104
That's all you need
to worry about.

27:54.106 --> 27:57.207
- Nobody else knows
about this, huh?

27:57.209 --> 28:00.144
- Just three people
in this room.

28:00.146 --> 28:03.247
- You know, a fence,
if you're lucky,

28:03.249 --> 28:05.416
will only give you 10%
on this stone.

28:05.418 --> 28:07.918
- We're good with that,
right, Christian?

28:07.920 --> 28:11.221
- Yeah, I'm good with that.

28:11.223 --> 28:14.058
- I want my fee up front
on this deal,

28:14.060 --> 28:16.060
considering I don't know
where the stone is coming from.

28:16.062 --> 28:17.728
Don't give me that dirty look.

28:17.730 --> 28:20.964
50 grand up front,
you've got a deal.

29:27.132 --> 29:32.202
- Oh, my god, Sandra.
Come in, mommy, come in.

29:32.204 --> 29:33.804
- Hey, ma, hey.

29:33.806 --> 29:37.141
- Oh, it's cold.
What are you doing here?

29:37.143 --> 29:39.877
It's got to be two years
since I've seen you.

29:39.879 --> 29:41.512
- Y-yeah, yeah.

29:41.514 --> 29:44.948
- Look at you,
you're beautiful, god bless.

29:44.950 --> 29:47.384
Let me take your coat.
What are you doing here, mommy?

29:47.386 --> 29:50.487
- So good to see you.
- You to, ma.

29:56.060 --> 29:58.128
- It's a mess, I'm sorry.

29:58.130 --> 30:01.098
- Yeah, some things
never change.

30:01.533 --> 30:05.302
- Yeah, well, at least I know
where he is at night.

30:07.472 --> 30:09.406
Can I get you some tea
or something, sweetie?

30:10.375 --> 30:14.244
- Uh... Coffee is fine.

30:14.246 --> 30:16.113
- Okay.
You okay?

30:16.115 --> 30:19.416
- Yeah.

30:19.418 --> 30:21.518
- My baby.

30:27.559 --> 30:29.526
Do you still like cream?

30:29.528 --> 30:33.096
- Uh, yeah, yeah I do.

30:33.098 --> 30:35.132
- Good.

30:35.134 --> 30:38.468
My baby, my little mommy.

30:38.470 --> 30:40.237
You look beautiful.

30:40.239 --> 30:43.140
- Thanks, mom.
Stop it.

30:43.142 --> 30:46.243
- I can't help it,
you're my baby.

30:48.513 --> 30:50.280
What brings you, baby?

30:50.282 --> 30:52.616
- I've got great news, mom.
- You do?

30:52.618 --> 30:55.219
I could use some great news.

30:56.354 --> 30:58.055
What?

30:58.057 --> 31:00.457
- Me and Eddie are going
to have a baby.

31:00.459 --> 31:02.626
- What?

31:02.628 --> 31:04.394
Oh, my god.

31:04.396 --> 31:07.264
- Can you believe it?

31:07.266 --> 31:09.967
- I'm so happy for youse.

31:09.969 --> 31:12.603
- Thanks, ma, thanks.

31:12.605 --> 31:14.238
- Oh.

31:14.240 --> 31:16.240
My baby is having a baby.

31:16.242 --> 31:18.442
- Mm-hmm.
- My god.

31:20.613 --> 31:24.314
That's wonderful.
- Mm. Yeah.

31:24.316 --> 31:27.951
But...

31:27.953 --> 31:30.487
- Sand.

31:30.489 --> 31:34.224
- I don't know what to do.
- About what, mommy?

31:38.930 --> 31:41.098
- I, uh...

31:43.534 --> 31:47.371
- Sandy, what?

31:47.373 --> 31:50.240
- I can't get him
to stop drinking...

31:52.911 --> 31:55.379
And gambling.

32:08.159 --> 32:10.227
You still love him, right?

32:10.229 --> 32:11.995
- Yeah, I do.

32:11.997 --> 32:15.933
- And he loves you?
- Yeah.

32:15.935 --> 32:18.669
- Okay, so...

32:21.640 --> 32:24.641
You love each other...
- Mm-hmm.

32:24.643 --> 32:29.446
- You're both young
and beautiful.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.148
Men have a tendency to change

32:31.150 --> 32:33.617
when a baby
comes along, sweetheart.

32:35.119 --> 32:37.621
- Not in this family.

32:40.458 --> 32:42.392
Hi, honey.

32:42.394 --> 32:44.494
- How you doing?

32:48.066 --> 32:51.168
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come here.

32:51.170 --> 32:52.536
- What?

32:52.538 --> 32:55.605
- That was kind of nice,
I want another.

32:55.607 --> 32:58.275
- Yeah?
- Come on.

33:00.311 --> 33:02.312
You look good.

33:05.350 --> 33:06.717
That's better.

33:06.719 --> 33:10.320
- Mm, mm-hmm.
- You do something different?

33:10.322 --> 33:12.089
- What?

33:12.091 --> 33:15.125
- I don't know.

33:15.127 --> 33:18.996
Yeah. It's a new conditioner.

33:18.998 --> 33:20.364
- Looks nice.

33:20.366 --> 33:22.466
- Mm-hmm.

33:33.778 --> 33:36.179
You'll never guess
where I went today.

33:38.483 --> 33:41.084
I went to go see my mother.

33:47.525 --> 33:49.192
- What the hell for?

33:49.194 --> 33:52.262
- Because, after two years,
I needed to talk to her.

33:52.264 --> 33:54.664
- What did she have to say?
Wait, wait, wait, let me guess.

33:54.666 --> 33:56.700
Let me guess.

33:56.702 --> 33:58.735
Dump the lousy degenerate.

33:58.737 --> 34:00.404
- No.
- Am I right?

34:00.406 --> 34:05.108
- No, no.
In fact, it's the opposite.

34:05.110 --> 34:06.410
- Surprising.

34:06.412 --> 34:09.312
- Yeah, surprised me.

34:09.313 --> 34:13.050
- And?

34:19.157 --> 34:21.792
- I wanted to tell her
the good news.

34:21.793 --> 34:26.429
- Which is what?

34:26.431 --> 34:29.800
What's behind door
number two, hmm?

34:36.440 --> 34:41.078
- You're going to be a father.

34:51.656 --> 34:54.091
Aren't you going
to say anything?

35:01.399 --> 35:05.268
Eddie, you always said
you wanted a family.

35:08.473 --> 35:10.407
Eddie.

35:23.254 --> 35:27.824
<i>You're going to be a father.</i>

35:37.135 --> 35:39.436
<i>Aren't you going
to say anything?</i>

35:50.148 --> 35:52.849
<i>You always said
you wanted a family.</i>

35:58.156 --> 36:01.658
- You already gave us
his name, Christian Flynn.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.693
Where does he live?

36:03.695 --> 36:05.862
- I don't know man,
he's a lowlife.

36:05.864 --> 36:08.298
I don't know, man, I don't know.

36:11.435 --> 36:14.804
- Where'd you meet him, Bobby?

36:14.806 --> 36:17.474
- Right down the sands once
or twice, man.

36:17.476 --> 36:20.443
Barely know him. He's just
some lowlife hood, man.

36:20.445 --> 36:22.746
Fucking barely know him.
He's a nobody!

36:22.748 --> 36:25.615
- He's somebody to us.

36:29.287 --> 36:31.821
Come on, Bobby,
you're a smart guy.

36:31.823 --> 36:33.957
You're going to tell me you get
a first name and a last name,

36:33.959 --> 36:36.426
you don't want to know anything
else about this guy?

36:36.428 --> 36:38.828
Huh? Just tell us
where to find him.

36:38.830 --> 36:41.398
- I don't know. I don't know.
I said I don't know!

36:41.400 --> 36:43.533
- Where the fuck is he?

36:45.736 --> 36:48.371
- All right, all right,
uh, margate.

36:48.373 --> 36:50.507
Something about margate.
Yeah, yeah.

36:50.509 --> 36:52.275
Lucy the elephant.

36:52.277 --> 36:54.211
I was... I was wasted, man.

37:17.568 --> 37:19.903
- Where did you go?

37:23.641 --> 37:25.842
- I'm sorry about before.

37:41.759 --> 37:43.793
Look at me.

37:49.567 --> 37:50.900
You know I've loved you

37:50.902 --> 37:54.738
since the minute
I laid eyes on you, right?

37:54.740 --> 37:57.274
- I know, Eddie, you tell me
that every day.

37:59.744 --> 38:02.979
- Because of that, I've kept

38:02.981 --> 38:07.017
a lot of the bad things
from you to protect you.

38:08.853 --> 38:11.521
I ain't going to do
that anymore.

38:13.858 --> 38:16.893
I'm in the middle
of a very dangerous deal.

38:16.895 --> 38:19.296
- You said you weren't going
to get involved

38:19.298 --> 38:22.732
with that stuff anymore.
- I know.

38:22.734 --> 38:24.901
I got pull...

38:24.903 --> 38:26.736
I lied.

38:33.811 --> 38:37.380
When it's done
in a couple days...

38:39.050 --> 38:46.923
I'm going to make everything
beautiful for you and the baby.

38:46.925 --> 38:49.326
Youse ain't going to have
to worry about nothing.

38:51.529 --> 38:54.631
And I'm going to be
the best father

38:54.633 --> 38:56.966
in the world to that kid.

39:06.043 --> 39:09.412
Come here.

39:09.414 --> 39:12.015
I promise.

39:12.017 --> 39:14.117
I promise you.

39:21.826 --> 39:24.961
- I want to believe
you, Giancarlo.

39:27.531 --> 39:29.833
I really do.

39:32.436 --> 39:34.838
- This time you can.

40:05.870 --> 40:09.506
- I want you to listen up,
okay, very carefully.

40:09.508 --> 40:12.108
I've held it in my hands.
I've seen it with my own eyes,

40:12.110 --> 40:16.012
57 magnificent carats
of uncut stone.

40:16.014 --> 40:19.015
I swear to god, it's gorgeous.

40:19.017 --> 40:24.154
- I don't know, sounds a bit of
a tall tale to me, my friend.

40:24.156 --> 40:27.424
Nick, what do you think?
Is this bloke crazy or what?

40:27.426 --> 40:30.093
- I've heard about these blood
diamonds coming in from Africa,

40:30.095 --> 40:34.664
but I don't know,
it sounds fishy.

40:34.666 --> 40:36.499
- I'm sorry, Matey.

40:36.501 --> 40:38.601
- Listen, there's nothing
fish about this report.

40:38.603 --> 40:41.805
The numbers are unbelievable.
You've got to take a look.

40:41.807 --> 40:43.773
- Sorry, we're
really not interested.

40:43.775 --> 40:45.742
- Please, what
do you have to lose?

40:45.744 --> 40:48.445
Take a look, I worked hard.

40:48.447 --> 40:50.547
- All right, fair enough.

40:59.490 --> 41:02.559
You weren't
bloody kidding, were you?

41:04.795 --> 41:08.198
- Who loves you more
than me, huh? Nobody.

41:08.200 --> 41:12.035
- If that thing is real...

41:12.037 --> 41:17.974
- Then the cut stones are worth
15 million easily, maybe more.

41:17.976 --> 41:20.777
- I'm not paying more than 10%,
15% tops.

41:20.779 --> 41:25.949
- What he means to say is 10%
is the maximum we'll pay.

41:28.686 --> 41:32.622
- Well, 10 seems more than fair.

41:32.624 --> 41:34.591
- What's the catch?

41:34.593 --> 41:37.560
- I want $100,000 up
front as a finder's fee.

41:37.562 --> 41:39.229
There is no catch.

41:39.231 --> 41:42.732
- I don't think so.
- Listen, everything is going

41:42.734 --> 41:45.001
to be taken care
of by me ahead of time.

41:45.003 --> 41:46.803
You guys have nothing to lose.

41:46.805 --> 41:50.507
The deal goes bad, you get
your money back, guaranteed.

41:50.509 --> 41:51.941
- Oh.

41:51.943 --> 41:54.544
No, I don't like
this whole up front thing.

41:54.546 --> 41:57.981
- We're going to table
this discussion

41:57.983 --> 42:00.817
until I've had a chance
to think about it.

42:47.132 --> 42:51.701
- Okay, okay.

42:51.703 --> 42:54.237
- What are you still doing here?

42:59.043 --> 43:02.178
- I was planning
on moving us out later today.

43:13.958 --> 43:16.793
Don't... don't...
Don't smoke that in here.

43:16.795 --> 43:18.695
She's been complaining
the last couple of days

43:18.697 --> 43:20.797
about how smoky it is.

43:23.334 --> 43:25.735
- Whatever you say.

43:27.871 --> 43:30.740
Seen the news
the last couple days?

43:31.709 --> 43:34.310
- You know I don't watch much TV.

43:36.880 --> 43:38.181
What?

43:38.183 --> 43:40.783
- Philly thing?
- Yeah?

43:40.785 --> 43:43.820
- It's all over the place.
- You serious?

43:43.822 --> 43:45.922
- Yeah.

43:46.357 --> 43:49.926
- Don't say anything about it
when she comes out of there.

43:49.928 --> 43:52.328
- She's going to find
out soon enough anyway.

43:58.970 --> 44:01.938
Uh-oh, here comes trouble.

44:01.940 --> 44:04.874
Hey.

44:04.876 --> 44:06.242
Mm.

44:06.244 --> 44:10.279
What are you hooligans
getting into today?

44:10.281 --> 44:12.315
- Ed?

44:19.990 --> 44:22.225
- Babe, you remember that deal

44:22.227 --> 44:24.427
I was telling you
about the other night?

44:24.429 --> 44:27.430
- Yeah.

44:35.072 --> 44:37.173
What about it?

44:40.711 --> 44:43.746
- Uh...

44:43.748 --> 44:46.049
We had a little problem on it.

44:48.886 --> 44:52.855
- What did you do this time?

44:52.857 --> 44:55.425
- The end result was good.

44:55.427 --> 44:57.460
There was some...

44:57.462 --> 44:59.996
Complications.

45:02.299 --> 45:05.268
- Is the one and only involved?

45:05.270 --> 45:07.737
- Yeah.

45:07.739 --> 45:09.906
- Damn it, you guys.

45:21.351 --> 45:23.753
Victor?

45:27.925 --> 45:30.026
- Him, too.

45:33.931 --> 45:36.332
- Sounds like
a winner of a deal.

45:41.805 --> 45:43.906
So?

45:47.845 --> 45:49.946
What happened?

45:58.021 --> 46:02.258
- Look, we don't want
to alarm you,

46:02.260 --> 46:05.294
but I need you
to get this room packed up

46:05.296 --> 46:07.330
while he and I look
for another motel.

46:07.332 --> 46:10.066
- It's like that, Eddie?
- Yeah.

46:10.834 --> 46:13.202
- Why do you constantly
do this stuff to me?

46:13.204 --> 46:15.204
- There is one more thing.

46:16.940 --> 46:19.075
- What's that?

46:19.077 --> 46:23.813
- Once this job is through
in a day or two,

46:23.815 --> 46:27.450
we're going to have
to get out of Atlantic city,

46:27.452 --> 46:31.120
and we can't come back.

46:36.794 --> 46:39.962
- You mean like
for a couple months?

46:43.167 --> 46:45.268
A year or something?

46:48.272 --> 46:50.373
What are you saying?

46:52.476 --> 46:54.544
- We can't ever come back.

47:00.083 --> 47:02.251
I was going to tell you later.

47:03.987 --> 47:06.088
- Sure you were.

47:12.529 --> 47:16.199
- Look, I'm going to give you
guys a couple minutes alone.

47:18.602 --> 47:20.570
Uh...

47:20.572 --> 47:22.305
I'll be outside.

47:22.307 --> 47:24.407
- Meet me around back.

47:33.083 --> 47:35.151
I was going to tell you later.

47:35.153 --> 47:37.220
Come on.

47:38.422 --> 47:40.890
- Don't.

47:48.366 --> 47:50.466
- What did you find out?

47:57.608 --> 48:01.210
- Victor works for New York.

48:01.212 --> 48:03.279
- Do you think that's
a problem for us?

48:03.281 --> 48:08.084
- No, my guess is he's doing
this deal on his own.

48:08.086 --> 48:11.654
- My thoughts exactly.

48:11.656 --> 48:13.356
- He's not stupid.

48:13.358 --> 48:15.958
Why would he cut them
in if he doesn't have to?

48:17.928 --> 48:20.997
- If things go the way
I think they might,

48:20.999 --> 48:23.566
I'll net 12 million,

48:23.568 --> 48:26.402
you'll net 2.
- Interesting math.

48:28.639 --> 48:30.373
You sound hesitant.

48:30.375 --> 48:32.675
- In order to do this deal,

48:32.677 --> 48:37.647
I have to put up
everything I have liquid.

48:37.649 --> 48:39.916
- I'll make sure
you're insulated.

48:39.918 --> 48:41.484
You won't get hurt.

48:41.486 --> 48:46.622
- Something goes wrong,
we're up the creek, my friend.

48:46.624 --> 48:49.492
- We're in the driver's seat.

48:49.494 --> 48:52.495
- Somehow I don't feel that way.

48:54.932 --> 48:58.167
- What can I do to help you?

48:58.169 --> 49:01.971
- I want you to search the city.

49:01.973 --> 49:04.473
Find whoever
is holding this diamond

49:04.475 --> 49:07.576
and take it away from them.

49:07.578 --> 49:09.412
- And?

49:09.414 --> 49:12.548
- Kill them quietly.

49:36.740 --> 49:39.041
- We'll probably be
an hour or two.

49:39.609 --> 49:42.178
Got to get some things
ironed out with Victor.

49:42.180 --> 49:44.714
- How are you getting there?
- Cab.

49:47.618 --> 49:49.685
Wouldn't it be better
if he came here?

49:52.622 --> 49:55.458
- Nah, it's better
if we meet him at his place.

49:55.460 --> 49:58.294
- Okay.

50:01.631 --> 50:04.433
I guess.

50:05.669 --> 50:08.237
- Listen, while we're out, can
you do me a favor and stay put?

50:10.207 --> 50:13.042
- I was going to say
good-bye to my parents.

50:13.044 --> 50:16.112
- Not a good idea.

50:16.114 --> 50:18.481
- Why?

50:18.483 --> 50:20.383
They need to know
what's going on.

50:20.385 --> 50:22.118
- What for?

50:22.120 --> 50:25.221
- Because they're my parents

50:25.223 --> 50:27.723
and they're the baby's
grandparents.

50:27.725 --> 50:30.026
- What baby?

50:34.331 --> 50:36.432
- You didn't tell him?

50:41.304 --> 50:43.406
- I'm going to be a daddy.

50:44.641 --> 50:47.543
- That's great news.

50:50.247 --> 50:52.715
- And you're going
to be his godfather.

50:52.717 --> 50:56.519
- Or hers. And I'd be honored.

51:00.357 --> 51:02.391
- Mm.

51:04.461 --> 51:06.328
- Now you want explain to her,
please,

51:06.330 --> 51:08.464
why she can't go down wildwood?

51:11.268 --> 51:15.271
- Look, I don't want
to get involved...

51:16.673 --> 51:19.675
But she's kind of got
a point, Eddie.

51:21.378 --> 51:24.547
- Oh, what do you want to go
see those losers for now, huh?

51:24.549 --> 51:27.783
After all the shit they put you
through, put us through?

51:27.785 --> 51:29.819
They don't even deserve
a good-bye!

51:29.821 --> 51:31.587
Forget them!

51:31.589 --> 51:34.190
- Eddie, you guys just told me

51:34.192 --> 51:36.192
I can never seen them again
after tomorrow.

51:36.194 --> 51:37.793
Now, I'm going to go say
good-bye to them

51:37.795 --> 51:39.495
whether you want me to or not.

51:39.497 --> 51:41.530
I'm not even having this
conversation with you right now.

51:41.532 --> 51:43.232
- Let's not do this, okay?

51:43.234 --> 51:45.134
- I've got a better idea,
how about this?

51:45.136 --> 51:47.436
I'll go down there and I'll beat
the shit out of both of them.

51:47.438 --> 51:48.771
Him for abusing you and her

51:48.773 --> 51:51.307
for letting it go
on all of that time!

51:51.309 --> 51:53.609
Both of them make me sick!

52:05.589 --> 52:07.690
- I can't believe you.

52:07.692 --> 52:10.426
I can't fucking believe you!

52:24.141 --> 52:25.641
- Shut up.

52:35.218 --> 52:36.785
- Mm.

52:36.787 --> 52:39.822
- Well, ladies, are you
enjoying your wine?

52:39.824 --> 52:41.490
- Yes.

52:41.492 --> 52:43.225
- You're getting
a little bit peckish?

52:43.227 --> 52:45.294
I think we are.

52:45.296 --> 52:46.795
- Yeah.

52:46.797 --> 52:52.501
- Mm. Would you like something
to munch on?

52:54.772 --> 52:57.840
Yes, yes.
- Sounds good.

53:00.511 --> 53:03.913
And what would you like
to munch on?

53:03.915 --> 53:06.482
- We could leave that
to your imagination.

53:06.484 --> 53:09.818
- Oh, let's not do imagining.
I mean, we're here.

53:12.323 --> 53:15.291
Hello, Nicholas.
Know everybody?

53:15.293 --> 53:17.560
- No.

53:20.830 --> 53:23.666
Excuse me. Gordon?

53:26.503 --> 53:28.404
Gordon?
- Mm-hmm.

53:28.406 --> 53:30.506
- Can I have a moment?

53:30.508 --> 53:34.443
- Yes, of course.
Ladies, will you excuse me?

53:48.358 --> 53:52.428
So, you look a little
under the weather.

53:52.430 --> 53:54.663
- I'm fine.

53:54.665 --> 53:58.701
I ran around
all over town with no luck.

53:58.703 --> 54:00.836
- That's a shame.

54:02.272 --> 54:04.540
- Is the deal set for tomorrow?

54:04.542 --> 54:06.308
- Mm-hmm.

54:06.310 --> 54:08.744
- Do you have the money?

54:10.647 --> 54:13.249
- No.

54:13.251 --> 54:15.718
- Why not?

54:15.720 --> 54:19.555
- Put up everything
I could liquid.

54:19.557 --> 54:21.690
It's not enough.

54:21.692 --> 54:24.260
So here's what we do.

54:24.262 --> 54:26.595
We make them think
we can pay them,

54:26.597 --> 54:27.997
we take the rock,

54:27.999 --> 54:29.898
you kill them all,

54:29.900 --> 54:32.568
then we go straight to Europe.

54:32.570 --> 54:36.639
- Two dead bodies in the house.

54:36.641 --> 54:39.908
I don't like it.

54:39.910 --> 54:43.045
- You will do what I ask, hmm?

55:10.907 --> 55:13.575
- I'll take first shift.

55:14.311 --> 55:17.646
- You sure, man?
You look kind of beat.

55:19.482 --> 55:21.950
- Yeah, I need to sit here
a while.

55:33.063 --> 55:35.964
- Eddie?

55:35.966 --> 55:38.834
Look, I'm sorry about Sandy.

55:40.503 --> 55:43.605
I know she was...

55:43.607 --> 55:45.674
Everything.

55:47.644 --> 55:50.646
- She was too good for a loser
like me, that's for sure.

55:52.949 --> 55:55.551
- I told you he was no good.

55:55.553 --> 55:58.387
I told you that a long
goddamn time ago.

56:00.123 --> 56:04.126
Why don't you ever listen
to me, huh?

56:04.128 --> 56:07.096
Now look at you.

56:07.098 --> 56:08.931
- Don't do it, please,
for the baby, please?

56:08.933 --> 56:11.567
Don't do it.
- Yeah. You're right.

56:11.569 --> 56:14.770
No, I shouldn't.
I shouldn't smoke.

56:14.772 --> 56:17.873
Look, I didn't come here
to argue with youse.

56:17.875 --> 56:20.476
- What did you come here for?
- I came here to say good-bye.

56:20.977 --> 56:22.978
- Good-bye?
- No.

56:22.980 --> 56:25.080
- Look...
- Well, good-bye.

56:30.019 --> 56:36.392
- Look, I know that you want
to blame yourself for...

56:37.827 --> 56:39.862
For all of this...

56:43.166 --> 56:45.401
But it's really not your fault.

56:45.403 --> 56:49.838
- I'm pissed at him,
but I love him.

56:49.840 --> 56:52.141
He's the father of the baby.

56:52.143 --> 56:54.109
I love him and I'm going
to go with him.

56:54.111 --> 56:55.744
- You're not going
anywhere, little girl.

56:55.746 --> 56:57.546
- Oh, you're n...
- You're not going anywhere

56:57.548 --> 56:59.415
unless it's over my dead body.
- You're not gonna tell me!

56:59.417 --> 57:01.583
- Stop!

57:05.955 --> 57:08.157
- You know what?

57:08.159 --> 57:12.161
I dragged youse both down
into my shitty world

57:12.163 --> 57:15.664
that I live in,

57:15.666 --> 57:18.534
and neither of youse
has any business here.

57:21.171 --> 57:23.739
And now she's out there
somewhere...

57:27.744 --> 57:31.213
Carrying my child

57:31.215 --> 57:33.949
in her stomach.

57:42.192 --> 57:44.493
A fatherless child.

57:50.600 --> 57:53.769
Maybe that's for the best.

57:59.676 --> 58:02.044
I'd only screw it up anyway.

58:48.992 --> 58:52.027
- Christian.

58:52.029 --> 58:54.696
Christian, wake up.
- What?

58:54.698 --> 58:57.599
What's the matter?

58:59.235 --> 59:02.571
- You got to take me down
to Sandy's parents in wildwood.

59:08.978 --> 59:10.979
- You kidding me?

59:10.981 --> 59:13.282
I mean...

59:13.284 --> 59:17.653
You know Tony definitely has
that entire street staked out.

59:19.022 --> 59:23.759
- No, he never knew her
last name or where she was from.

59:23.761 --> 59:25.861
We'll be fine.

59:36.906 --> 59:38.840
Come on, get up.

59:40.777 --> 59:43.645
I can't live without her.

59:43.647 --> 59:46.014
You got to take me.

59:48.151 --> 59:52.120
- Why do I always
let you do this?

59:59.829 --> 01:00:02.297
- Ma?

01:00:10.006 --> 01:00:12.874
- Hey.

01:00:12.876 --> 01:00:15.611
How are you doing?

01:00:15.613 --> 01:00:18.280
- How am I doing?

01:00:25.221 --> 01:00:28.824
- House looks good,
place looks good.

01:00:28.826 --> 01:00:33.295
- All right.
- Where's she at, Dean?

01:00:33.297 --> 01:00:35.631
- My wife is out shopping.

01:00:35.633 --> 01:00:37.299
Went shop...

01:00:37.301 --> 01:00:39.768
It ain't none
of your business anyway.

01:00:41.771 --> 01:00:43.705
- Sandy, where's Sandy?

01:00:43.707 --> 01:00:46.341
- Sandy?
- Yeah.

01:00:46.343 --> 01:00:48.143
- Haven't seen her
in a couple years.

01:00:48.145 --> 01:00:50.012
Two years, three years.

01:00:54.684 --> 01:00:56.852
- I know she just
came down here.

01:00:56.854 --> 01:00:58.387
Come on, where's she at?

01:01:06.929 --> 01:01:10.365
- You want a little?

01:01:10.367 --> 01:01:12.668
- Nah, I'm good.

01:01:18.908 --> 01:01:21.777
You want to tell me
about this thing?

01:01:21.779 --> 01:01:23.445
What about this?

01:01:25.782 --> 01:01:28.684
- They belong to my wife.
- Yeah? 'Cause they look

01:01:28.686 --> 01:01:30.819
a lot like Sandy's.

01:01:30.821 --> 01:01:34.423
- I told you before, we haven't
seen Sandy in a long time.

01:01:34.425 --> 01:01:38.126
Worse thing ever happened
to me and my family

01:01:38.128 --> 01:01:41.997
is when my only daughter got
mixed up with a creep like you.

01:01:41.999 --> 01:01:43.865
Why?

01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:45.734
I don't know what the hell
she sees in you.

01:01:45.736 --> 01:01:48.003
- I'm sure there are worse
things

01:01:48.005 --> 01:01:50.105
that happened to your family.

01:02:01.218 --> 01:02:03.819
What are you going
to do with that?

01:02:03.821 --> 01:02:05.887
- What do you think
I'm going to do?

01:02:06.289 --> 01:02:07.923
- Not much when this is
pointed at you.

01:02:08.891 --> 01:02:12.094
- That don't mean shit to me.
What do you want to do?

01:02:12.096 --> 01:02:15.130
- I'll tell you what, you put
that down, I'll put this down.

01:02:15.132 --> 01:02:17.999
What do you think?
Go ahead, put it down.

01:02:18.001 --> 01:02:20.168
- Yeah. Put it down.

01:02:21.871 --> 01:02:24.172
- Shh.

01:02:25.241 --> 01:02:27.075
- Ma. Mom!

01:02:27.077 --> 01:02:28.810
- Please, please, please,
please, please, please.

01:02:28.812 --> 01:02:30.312
Please, let them go.
Let them go.

01:02:36.285 --> 01:02:40.122
- He's the baby's father.
I've got to go.

01:02:40.124 --> 01:02:41.423
Mom!

01:02:41.425 --> 01:02:44.259
- I know he is,
and I respect that,

01:02:44.261 --> 01:02:45.961
and you need to be a family.

01:02:45.963 --> 01:02:48.230
You just can't go now.
You can't go out there now.

01:02:48.232 --> 01:02:51.233
Please, you can't go out there.
Shh, shh, shh.

01:02:51.235 --> 01:02:54.770
- Mom. Mom.
- No.

01:02:54.772 --> 01:02:57.172
- I can't stand it.
- Shh, shh, shh!

01:02:57.174 --> 01:02:59.841
Shh, just... just relax.
Shh, shh, shh.

01:02:59.843 --> 01:03:01.777
Just relax.
Shh, shh.

01:03:01.779 --> 01:03:03.211
- Eddie!

01:03:05.315 --> 01:03:07.549
- Sandy?
- Yeah.

01:03:09.952 --> 01:03:11.953
- What the hell
are you doing in there?

01:03:11.955 --> 01:03:14.489
- He heard you coming,
and he locked us in.

01:03:14.491 --> 01:03:17.425
- Get back away from the door.

01:03:22.366 --> 01:03:25.834
- What's the name of the place?

01:03:25.836 --> 01:03:27.502
Tell me the name.

01:03:27.504 --> 01:03:30.305
- You told me 400 times already.

01:03:30.307 --> 01:03:32.541
- The one on pawleys island.

01:03:32.543 --> 01:03:35.510
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:03:38.815 --> 01:03:40.916
This is a burner cell.

01:03:44.387 --> 01:03:47.956
The only number in it
is this one.

01:03:47.958 --> 01:03:50.992
When you get down there
and you're safe,

01:03:50.994 --> 01:03:53.028
all the number
and then ditch the phone.

01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:55.197
- All right.

01:03:55.199 --> 01:03:57.465
- Here.

01:03:57.467 --> 01:04:00.535
- What is that?
- Five grand in 20's.

01:04:00.537 --> 01:04:03.605
It should be more than enough
to take care of everything.

01:04:13.583 --> 01:04:15.450
Come on, everything
is going to be fine.

01:04:15.452 --> 01:04:18.019
Come here. All right?

01:04:18.021 --> 01:04:20.088
Go, come on, let's go.

01:04:23.926 --> 01:04:25.527
Let's go.

01:04:25.529 --> 01:04:28.263
- If something happens to you,
how am I supposed to know?

01:04:28.265 --> 01:04:30.265
- I'll be a day or two
behind you, stop.

01:04:30.267 --> 01:04:33.468
All right?
Sam, pop the trunk.

01:04:42.445 --> 01:04:44.045
Make sure she gets
the next train to DC.

01:04:44.047 --> 01:04:47.215
All right, you wait
with her, okay?

01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:50.051
Here you go.
Get going.

01:05:57.987 --> 01:06:00.221
Start the car.

01:06:04.727 --> 01:06:07.062
- Whatever you say.

01:06:21.277 --> 01:06:23.979
- You know how to get on black
horse pike towards pine barrens?

01:06:25.681 --> 01:06:27.282
- Yeah.

01:06:29.051 --> 01:06:31.152
- Do that.

01:06:55.311 --> 01:06:57.612
In the woods that way.

01:07:47.530 --> 01:07:49.497
So you went out

01:07:49.499 --> 01:07:51.633
looking for me last night,

01:07:51.635 --> 01:07:55.070
only in a lot
of the wrong places.

01:07:55.072 --> 01:07:56.771
Obviously,
you're not very bright.

01:07:56.773 --> 01:07:59.607
- Obviously.

01:07:59.609 --> 01:08:02.710
- What were you trying to do?

01:08:02.712 --> 01:08:04.279
Talk.

01:08:04.281 --> 01:08:07.182
- Gordon told me
to get the diamond.

01:08:09.118 --> 01:08:10.819
- And then what?

01:08:10.821 --> 01:08:13.154
- Well, he told me
to take care of you,

01:08:13.156 --> 01:08:15.423
but I wasn't going to do it.

01:08:15.425 --> 01:08:17.559
- You want to know
something pal?

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:21.763
I got bodies buried all around
here underneath this snow.

01:08:26.135 --> 01:08:28.870
You're getting ready
to join them.

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:33.108
- There you are.

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:36.678
- No, no, no, no, no, wait.

01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:39.113
Please, I...
I'll do whatever you want.

01:08:39.116 --> 01:08:41.216
Just tell me what you want.

01:08:42.518 --> 01:08:44.486
- Tonight, when we make
the exchange,

01:08:44.488 --> 01:08:46.821
you're going to kill your boss

01:08:46.823 --> 01:08:49.323
and I'm going to whack you off
a couple of hundred grand

01:08:49.326 --> 01:08:51.792
out of that money

01:08:51.795 --> 01:08:55.630
and I'm keeping the rest of it
and the diamond.

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:58.600
You follow me?
- Hey, whatever you want.

01:08:58.602 --> 01:09:01.236
I didn't like the guy
in the first place.

01:09:01.238 --> 01:09:05.740
- Anything other than that
happens, youse are both gone.

01:09:05.742 --> 01:09:07.774
Now make tracks.

01:09:07.777 --> 01:09:10.278
Hopefully you don't get shot in
the back while you're doing it.

01:09:11.481 --> 01:09:14.215
- Shit!

01:09:25.661 --> 01:09:27.595
- You're mine, Eddie.

01:09:27.596 --> 01:09:30.564
Run little rabbit, run.

01:10:55.251 --> 01:10:57.652
- Oh, shit.

01:11:02.758 --> 01:11:05.560
Eddie!

01:11:09.698 --> 01:11:12.667
Making me chase you
through the fucking woods,

01:11:12.669 --> 01:11:15.470
all that snow.

01:11:15.472 --> 01:11:19.307
You ruined my favorite pair
of shoes, you fuck.

01:12:35.651 --> 01:12:39.020
Where are you, marturano?!

01:12:39.022 --> 01:12:41.356
Where are you?!

01:12:48.697 --> 01:12:51.933
Where are you, marturano?

01:12:51.935 --> 01:12:55.069
Where are you, you fucking rat?

01:12:55.071 --> 01:12:56.904
Answer me, motherfucker.

01:12:56.906 --> 01:13:00.375
Answer me!

01:13:14.823 --> 01:13:18.092
- To marichel, she's so corrupt

01:13:18.094 --> 01:13:21.829
that crooks like us
have a fighting chance.

01:13:28.737 --> 01:13:31.439
- We didn't come here
to make conversation.

01:13:31.441 --> 01:13:33.708
- Oh, what a shame.

01:13:33.710 --> 01:13:37.645
You see, when I was young,
we were taught to be gentlemen.

01:13:37.647 --> 01:13:41.149
- My friend didn't mean
any disrespect.

01:13:42.718 --> 01:13:45.453
What did you want to talk about?

01:13:45.455 --> 01:13:48.923
- Well, for starters,
where that stone came from.

01:13:48.925 --> 01:13:55.563
That hack of a salesman, Victor,
was not very forthcoming.

01:13:55.565 --> 01:13:59.434
- Interesting take on Victor.

01:14:02.671 --> 01:14:05.940
It's a blood diamond
from Africa.

01:14:05.942 --> 01:14:08.009
- We know that.

01:14:08.011 --> 01:14:12.013
What he wants to know
is where you got it.

01:14:12.015 --> 01:14:14.148
- Why do you care?

01:14:14.150 --> 01:14:18.019
- Because I don't want to try
and sell it

01:14:18.021 --> 01:14:22.557
to whoever you stole it from
or their associates.

01:14:22.559 --> 01:14:26.627
That might make my time left
on this planet very short,

01:14:26.629 --> 01:14:29.163
and it's short enough already.

01:14:31.967 --> 01:14:35.670
- The truth is,
we were doing another job,

01:14:35.672 --> 01:14:39.140
and it kind of fell
into our laps.

01:14:39.142 --> 01:14:42.777
- Likely story.

01:14:42.779 --> 01:14:45.613
- You're getting
the price of a lifetime.

01:14:45.615 --> 01:14:49.517
Put the money on the table,
or we're going to walk.

01:14:53.188 --> 01:14:57.058
- Tell me this, if I sell this
in Europe,

01:14:57.060 --> 01:14:59.961
is it likely
to give me any trouble?

01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:07.001
- Honestly, we don't know.

01:15:07.003 --> 01:15:09.670
Not likely.

01:15:12.908 --> 01:15:16.210
- I suppose I'm just going
to have to take a chance.

01:15:19.214 --> 01:15:21.516
Show me the diamond.

01:16:02.925 --> 01:16:04.859
Give them what they want.

01:16:19.741 --> 01:16:21.842
Here the whole time.

01:16:29.284 --> 01:16:31.686
One, two, two.

01:16:40.696 --> 01:16:44.966
- This is truly magnificent.

01:16:53.810 --> 01:16:56.877
- Eddie?

01:16:59.781 --> 01:17:02.149
Eddie, come on.

01:17:02.151 --> 01:17:04.318
Eddie, wake up, baby.

01:17:26.975 --> 01:17:28.676
Wake up.
