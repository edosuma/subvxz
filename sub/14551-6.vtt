WEBVTT

00:10.541 --> 00:13.456
Previously on Powers...

00:13.541 --> 00:16.540
We have three dead Powers
taking the same drug.

00:16.652 --> 00:17.652
Sway is Wolfe.

00:17.652 --> 00:19.651
That's an unregulated Power's enhancer.

00:19.652 --> 00:21.652
Wolfe broke out of his restraints.

00:23.652 --> 00:27.652
If you find Wolfe, inflict as
much damage as quickly as possible.

00:29.070 --> 00:31.652
We need to overwhelm his healing power.

00:33.652 --> 00:36.529
You seal him in and you
wait for the rest of us.

00:36.652 --> 00:38.237
Golden's down. Golden's down.

00:38.404 --> 00:40.651
We will drive him back into his cell

00:40.652 --> 00:42.651
where the Drainer will be set up.

00:42.652 --> 00:43.862
He takes away their powers.

00:43.987 --> 00:46.651
The green light goes on, the powers go off.

00:46.652 --> 00:47.651
No!

00:47.652 --> 00:50.652
No more of my friends die.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.074

01:30.652 --> 01:34.070
Why aren't we keeping
him fully restrained, sir?

01:34.195 --> 01:36.070
I want to see what he does.

01:36.237 --> 01:38.652
I want to know what he wants.

01:41.652 --> 01:43.652
Did you invent it just for me?

01:45.987 --> 01:48.652
No, you're more ambitious than that.

01:50.652 --> 01:53.651
Not satisfied being the
smartest boy in the room anymore,

01:53.652 --> 01:56.571
are you, Harley?

01:56.652 --> 01:58.736
Decided to bring us all
down to the same level.

01:58.903 --> 02:00.651
You're not on my level.

02:00.652 --> 02:01.778
No one is.

02:01.903 --> 02:04.652
We're below you, is that it?

02:17.652 --> 02:18.987
What does it feel like?

02:20.652 --> 02:22.651
Like the invention

02:22.652 --> 02:25.652
of someone who's afraid of something.

02:26.571 --> 02:28.028
What are you afraid of?

02:29.652 --> 02:32.652
And why are you tippling during work hours?

02:49.652 --> 02:50.987
What did you just feel?

02:51.112 --> 02:53.651
You should fix that.

02:53.652 --> 02:55.529
What did you feel?

02:57.652 --> 03:00.652
I felt hunger.

03:01.652 --> 03:03.651
No one goes in without me.

03:03.652 --> 03:05.651
Should I call you when
his legal team arrives?

03:05.652 --> 03:07.612
They can talk to him through the intercom.

03:07.652 --> 03:08.652
I have a thing.

04:04.652 --> 04:06.651
Are you ready?

04:10.652 --> 04:12.651
Are you sure you want to go?

04:12.652 --> 04:15.445
They haven't announced anything yet.

04:15.612 --> 04:17.651
And you're not expected.

04:17.652 --> 04:20.070
I have to go. It's part of the job.

06:13.652 --> 06:15.651
Hey!

06:15.652 --> 06:17.652
You little shits!

06:28.652 --> 06:29.652
Are you hurt?

06:31.195 --> 06:32.652
Come on! Come on!

06:51.652 --> 06:55.651
You think it'd be better if
you were dead instead of her?

06:55.652 --> 06:57.651
What would that fix, Kutter?

06:57.652 --> 06:59.651
There's no shame in being alive.

06:59.652 --> 07:01.652
Fuck do you know? You weren't there.

07:01.778 --> 07:03.651
Hey.

07:03.652 --> 07:06.651
He wasn't there because he broke his arm

07:06.652 --> 07:08.652
trying to help Stockley.

07:09.612 --> 07:10.651
Sure, whatever.

07:10.652 --> 07:12.652
It's too bad Adlard didn't make it.

07:14.652 --> 07:16.652
Yeah, may he rest in peace.

07:17.652 --> 07:18.651
Cheers.

07:18.652 --> 07:21.652
I'm right here, guys. Still not dead.

07:22.652 --> 07:23.651
I can still hear his voice.

07:23.652 --> 07:26.651
We love you, brother.

07:26.652 --> 07:28.651
At least the department
sprang for the booze this time.

07:28.652 --> 07:30.651
Only takes four dead
cops to get free booze.

07:30.652 --> 07:33.652
There's no justice in them being dead.

07:33.778 --> 07:35.651
And the Drainer's gonna change things.

07:35.652 --> 07:37.651
Fuck the Drainer.

07:37.652 --> 07:38.653
There's two of them in the whole world.

07:38.778 --> 07:40.651
Ours doesn't even work yet
and Wolfe's in the other,

07:40.652 --> 07:43.651
kicking back, talking to his lawyers.

07:43.652 --> 07:44.651
Now what we should be doing,

07:44.652 --> 07:47.362
we should be cutting off his skin.

07:47.529 --> 07:48.651
And right before he dies,

07:48.652 --> 07:49.820
we turn the Drainer off

07:49.987 --> 07:52.652
just long enough for him to heal.

07:53.112 --> 07:54.651
And then we turn it on,

07:54.652 --> 07:56.651
set him on fire,

07:56.652 --> 07:58.652
then let people piss out the flames.

07:59.652 --> 08:01.652
Show that shit on TV.

08:06.028 --> 08:07.652
How about it, Walker?

08:08.652 --> 08:10.652
You enjoy seeing that?

08:12.652 --> 08:14.652
I'd bring the popcorn.

08:15.652 --> 08:17.652
- Fuck yeah.
- Fuck yeah.

08:18.237 --> 08:19.652
Let's get a drink.

08:22.652 --> 08:25.695
Or we could offer our condolences first.

08:28.279 --> 08:29.652
Mmm, absolutely.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.650
The names you asked for.

08:40.652 --> 08:43.650
Everyone got the Sway from one of me.

08:43.652 --> 08:45.651
Except Olympia.

08:45.652 --> 08:47.651
And Walker?

08:47.652 --> 08:50.651
Oh, we both know where he probably got it.

08:50.652 --> 08:53.651
Calista gave what she had to Olympia.

08:53.652 --> 08:54.820
You're sure?

08:54.945 --> 08:57.651
Every time there's a
problem, it leads back to her.

08:57.652 --> 08:59.652
She's not the problem.

09:00.652 --> 09:02.651
- Does she know you follow her?
- No.

09:02.652 --> 09:05.651
I don't want the police to
get their hands on her again.

09:05.652 --> 09:06.652
They won't.

09:08.652 --> 09:11.651
Do you know the story of the Nemean lion?

09:11.652 --> 09:13.651
From the Labors of Hercules.

09:13.652 --> 09:16.651
For his first task,

09:16.652 --> 09:19.652
Hercules was sent to
kill an invulnerable lion,

09:20.652 --> 09:22.651
and return with its hide.

09:22.652 --> 09:25.651
He realized the only way to kill the lion

09:25.652 --> 09:27.945
was to strangle it with his bare hands.

09:32.652 --> 09:34.651
Sway is doing something

09:34.652 --> 09:36.987
I don't understand.

09:37.154 --> 09:40.652
I'll need help from one
of you to figure it out.

09:42.652 --> 09:43.652
I'll do it.

09:44.736 --> 09:46.651
I can handle it.

09:46.652 --> 09:47.652
It won't be pleasant.

10:04.652 --> 10:06.529
We've lost so many.

10:08.652 --> 10:10.652
And we will lose more.

10:12.652 --> 10:14.652
But our... our hearts...

10:16.652 --> 10:19.651
We must not surrender our hearts

10:19.652 --> 10:21.028
to anger

10:21.195 --> 10:22.652
or hatred.

10:24.652 --> 10:25.653
Be compassionate.

10:26.652 --> 10:28.652
Work for peace in your heart

10:29.652 --> 10:31.652
and the world.

10:32.652 --> 10:36.652
Work for peace and never give up,

10:37.652 --> 10:39.651
no matter what's happening,

10:39.652 --> 10:42.651
no matter what's going on around you,

10:42.652 --> 10:45.652
I say again, never give up!

10:48.652 --> 10:50.652
And fear nothing.

10:55.652 --> 10:57.651
Golden,

10:57.652 --> 10:58.652
Chaykin,

11:00.652 --> 11:02.612
Argento,

11:04.945 --> 11:06.651
Mack.

11:06.652 --> 11:08.652
Cheers.

11:16.652 --> 11:19.652
So what happened with
Hercules and the lion?

11:23.154 --> 11:26.652
Even after Hercules killed the lion,

11:28.612 --> 11:30.652
he still couldn't take its hide.

11:32.070 --> 11:34.652
Because it was impenetrable.

11:36.652 --> 11:38.652
Precisely.

11:43.652 --> 11:45.651
But I thought the point of Sway was

11:45.652 --> 11:48.651
to give us something that
no one could ever take away.

11:48.652 --> 11:50.652
Powers Complete.

11:51.652 --> 11:54.652
A family bound by strength.

11:56.652 --> 11:58.652
No one can hurt us.

12:00.652 --> 12:02.652
Look at all the places we've been.

12:02.778 --> 12:05.651
All the lives we've touched.

12:05.652 --> 12:07.651
We have to know if Sway

12:07.652 --> 12:09.651
can be removed.

12:09.652 --> 12:12.651
So, in the end, how did
Hercules take the lion's hide?

12:12.652 --> 12:15.651
With the beast's own claws.

12:15.652 --> 12:19.652
I'll have to teleport
the Sway from your body.

12:20.652 --> 12:22.652
Cut it out from your DNA.

12:27.652 --> 12:29.571
I'm ready.

12:50.652 --> 12:52.652
Hey, one of those for me?

12:57.404 --> 13:00.028
Okay, uh... I fucked up.

13:03.652 --> 13:07.651
I... I shouldn't have done what I did.

13:07.652 --> 13:09.651
Hmm, are you talking about

13:09.652 --> 13:12.320
locking me in a cell or taking Sway?

13:12.487 --> 13:13.652
Shh.

13:20.652 --> 13:23.651
I had to try something. They were dying!

13:23.652 --> 13:27.279
And taking some shit that could've
killed you was the solution?

13:27.404 --> 13:28.651
- When I walked out of that cell...
- I had to try!

13:28.652 --> 13:30.652
I thought you were dead.

13:31.652 --> 13:33.279
Sorry to disappoint you.

13:33.445 --> 13:34.651
Don't make this into a joke.

13:34.652 --> 13:35.651
What? I'm stepping on your lines?

13:35.652 --> 13:37.651
The only reason you're here
is because Zora showed up,

13:37.652 --> 13:38.651
and you wanna make jokes about...

13:38.652 --> 13:41.612
Oh, Zora! Yeah, she's the real deal.

13:41.652 --> 13:43.651
I'm a lucky guy! Yeah.

13:43.652 --> 13:45.652
Yeah. You are.

13:46.487 --> 13:47.945
Yeah.

13:48.070 --> 13:49.651
Calista's still out there.

13:49.652 --> 13:52.651
Royalle is still planning
whatever the fuck he's planning.

13:52.652 --> 13:55.362
We have work to do.

13:55.529 --> 13:59.112
I mean, that's four of our
own, dead, because of Royalle.

13:59.237 --> 14:02.112
And I need to know we're on the same page.

14:02.279 --> 14:03.987
Four of our own?

14:04.154 --> 14:05.736
You barely knew 'em.

14:09.652 --> 14:10.652
Ugh.

14:11.652 --> 14:13.652
Well, your Dad's a hit.

14:16.652 --> 14:19.651
Oh, fuck you. Fuck you.

14:19.652 --> 14:20.653
DEA tipped us off.

14:20.778 --> 14:22.651
Mule house in Tinder Banks is moving

14:22.652 --> 14:25.651
five million in base a month.

14:25.652 --> 14:26.652
We get there,

14:26.652 --> 14:28.651
no spotters, no guards,

14:28.652 --> 14:29.651
nothing.

14:29.652 --> 14:31.651
Go in the house. Jackpot.

14:31.652 --> 14:35.279
But it's not five million, it's ten, easy.

14:35.404 --> 14:37.651
Then, all of a sudden,
one of the walls blows in.

14:37.652 --> 14:39.651
Tinder Banks Outlaws, half the crew,

14:39.652 --> 14:40.651
blasting away at us.

14:40.652 --> 14:42.651
And they got a Power.

14:42.652 --> 14:44.651
Fuckin' Sorcerer Slim.

14:44.652 --> 14:47.195
You went a couple of rounds
with Sorcerer Slim back when.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.651
Am I right, big guy?

14:49.652 --> 14:52.651
He was over the hill by
the time I was around.

14:52.652 --> 14:53.651
Yeah, well, this was in his prime.

14:53.652 --> 14:56.651
Mother fucker is shooting
plasma blasts out of his fists.

14:56.652 --> 14:59.651
And he's bulletproof.

14:59.652 --> 15:02.651
Oh, yeah. We're fucking dead.

15:02.652 --> 15:06.404
Then swoosh! A streak of
white and gold swoops down

15:06.529 --> 15:08.652
and Slim shoots up in the sky with it.

15:10.652 --> 15:12.651
Five second later...

15:12.652 --> 15:14.651
Boom! He hits the ground.

15:14.652 --> 15:16.651
Screaming. Then, three Outlaws

15:16.652 --> 15:18.651
disappear, fall... Boom, boom, boom!

15:18.652 --> 15:20.651
- More screaming.
- Holy shit!

15:20.652 --> 15:22.028
Until they're all on the ground

15:22.195 --> 15:23.651
flopping around like carp.

15:23.652 --> 15:28.195
Then, Olympia swoops down.

15:28.362 --> 15:30.722
"Sorry I'm late, fellas. I had
to get checked for the clap."

15:31.653 --> 15:33.237
That's awesome.

15:33.362 --> 15:37.112
Everybody went out and got
Olympia tattoos after that.

15:37.237 --> 15:41.651
I always say, let cops do cop shit.

15:41.652 --> 15:43.651
But it's always good
to have a Power come in

15:43.652 --> 15:45.652
and deal with Powers bullshit.

15:45.736 --> 15:47.571
Olympia was a pimp.

15:49.652 --> 15:52.651
You want to know what Olympia
really thought about cops?

15:52.652 --> 15:55.028
He thought that every cop on the LAPD

15:55.195 --> 15:57.651
was his personal bag man.

15:57.652 --> 16:00.195
There to clean up his "indiscretions."

16:00.362 --> 16:02.652
Harley, can I talk to you for a second?

16:03.652 --> 16:05.652
- I'm dry.
- We can fix that.

16:09.652 --> 16:12.651
Hey! I ever tell you guys
about Three Titty Tony?

16:12.652 --> 16:14.651
Now this guy!

16:14.652 --> 16:15.651
You little shits!

16:15.652 --> 16:16.652
Here it comes.

16:18.652 --> 16:19.652
Such bullshit.

16:20.652 --> 16:22.651
Did you even see what she did?

16:22.652 --> 16:24.651
Yeah, we weren't hurting anyone.

16:24.652 --> 16:26.651
And she fucking jumps, and...

16:26.652 --> 16:27.651
She wasn't hurting anyone either.

16:27.652 --> 16:30.487
And you were tagging a police station.

16:30.612 --> 16:32.651
Yeah, well, you were filming it.

16:32.652 --> 16:35.652
Dude, you totally ran from a Power.

16:36.652 --> 16:37.651
Yeah?

16:37.652 --> 16:40.652
- Who's running now, huh?
- Stop! Ah!

16:41.112 --> 16:42.651
Payback!

16:42.652 --> 16:43.651
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, stop!

16:43.652 --> 16:44.652
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

16:56.652 --> 16:58.028
Sorry.

16:58.652 --> 17:00.651
- What's up?
- Um...

17:00.652 --> 17:02.445
Everything okay?

17:02.612 --> 17:03.652
Yeah.

17:04.652 --> 17:05.651
I gotta go.

17:05.652 --> 17:07.651
What? Why?

17:07.652 --> 17:09.651
Sorry, I just... I promised him

17:09.652 --> 17:11.362
I'd always answer.

17:11.487 --> 17:12.652
Royalle?

17:14.652 --> 17:15.652
He's a creep!

17:15.652 --> 17:18.651
You don't know! You don't
know anything about him!

17:18.652 --> 17:19.651
Yeah, well, I know him and his Powers

17:19.652 --> 17:20.732
mean more to you than I do.

17:20.862 --> 17:22.651
So go.

17:22.652 --> 17:26.652
You know, for a minute there,
I thought that we were...

17:43.652 --> 17:45.652
So, when's it gonna be working?

17:47.652 --> 17:51.651
As soon as I figure out
what's wrong with it.

17:51.652 --> 17:53.651
So far I've only been able
to get the prototype pod

17:53.652 --> 17:56.652
and the unit in Wolfe's cell to work.

17:57.652 --> 17:59.652
But that one works, right?

18:02.652 --> 18:05.736
Harley? The one in Wolfe's cell does work?

18:06.652 --> 18:08.652
Nothing's permanent.

18:08.778 --> 18:11.612
You, of all people, know that.

18:12.652 --> 18:15.651
We talking Drainers or sobriety?

18:15.652 --> 18:18.651
Fuck you! You mind?

18:18.652 --> 18:23.651
So, as long as Wolfe
stays under the Drainer,

18:23.652 --> 18:24.651
he's powerless.

18:24.652 --> 18:29.651
As long as there's not a power surge

18:29.652 --> 18:31.862
or a black out

18:31.987 --> 18:35.652
or a system hack...

18:37.028 --> 18:38.651
Oh, shit!

18:38.652 --> 18:41.612
No pressure, Harley. Just anticipate

18:41.652 --> 18:43.651
every possible problem.

18:43.652 --> 18:45.651
And what if there is a problem?

18:45.652 --> 18:47.945
I fix it. That's my power, Walker.

18:49.652 --> 18:50.651
I adapt.

18:50.652 --> 18:51.652
Jesus.

18:54.652 --> 18:55.652
You're welcome.

18:56.652 --> 18:57.651
You're an asshole.

18:57.652 --> 19:01.112
Well, here's to the eternal
brotherhood of assholes.

19:01.279 --> 19:03.651
That's what we should've
called our cartoon.

19:03.652 --> 19:05.651
Powers United.

19:05.652 --> 19:07.651
Shit, I mean, that's Janice all the way.

19:07.652 --> 19:08.862
Classic Janice.

19:10.652 --> 19:12.651
You had an idea. Remind me.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.651
What was your idea?

19:14.652 --> 19:15.652
Powers Up.

19:15.652 --> 19:18.651
Oh, so it really could've been worse.

19:18.652 --> 19:20.070
Yeah.

19:23.652 --> 19:26.651
So, look...

19:26.652 --> 19:30.652
When someone's in the light,
what happens to their power?

19:32.652 --> 19:35.279
I told you. The green light goes on.

19:35.404 --> 19:36.651
- And then...
- The power goes off.

19:36.652 --> 19:39.651
But you also said that if
Wolfe leaves the Drainer,

19:39.652 --> 19:41.651
his powers come back.

19:41.652 --> 19:43.736
Where do they go?

19:43.903 --> 19:46.445
You want the address?

19:46.571 --> 19:48.651
I'm sorry, but, I don't know

19:48.652 --> 19:50.651
how to get your powers back.

19:50.652 --> 19:53.652
This isn't a wormhole into Powers Land.

19:55.652 --> 19:58.652
Power can't just disappear, Harley.

20:00.070 --> 20:03.112
So, where the fuck does it go?

20:03.237 --> 20:04.651
I know you figured something out.

20:04.652 --> 20:07.651
I could give you a whole list

20:07.652 --> 20:10.651
of scientific explanations and, but...

20:10.652 --> 20:13.571
What? I'm not smart enough to understand?

20:13.652 --> 20:14.652
I'm just saying.

20:16.652 --> 20:18.028
Fuck you.

20:32.652 --> 20:33.820
Mrs. Chaykin...

20:40.652 --> 20:42.651
Thank you so much for coming.

20:42.652 --> 20:44.651
This means so much to all of us.

20:44.652 --> 20:46.651
Oh, it's my honor.

20:46.652 --> 20:48.652
And I'm so deeply,
deeply sad for your loss.

20:57.652 --> 20:58.651
Thank you, dear.

20:58.652 --> 21:00.945
Yes. Yes. I appreciate it.

21:24.652 --> 21:26.651
You okay?

21:26.652 --> 21:28.652
Buy me a drink?

21:32.652 --> 21:35.653
You know, in the stories how they
say all's well that ends well, right?

21:35.778 --> 21:37.651
So, you've got Boom! Boom! Boom!

21:37.652 --> 21:39.651
Fuckin' Sorcerer Slim and company

21:39.652 --> 21:41.362
falling out of the sky.

21:41.529 --> 21:43.651
So my partner asks, "What's going on?"

21:43.652 --> 21:45.652
"Uh, it's raining assholes."

21:46.652 --> 21:48.987
Never thought a Power could get VD.

21:49.112 --> 21:51.651
Detective, grab a drink, join the party.

21:51.652 --> 21:53.651
Your dad's hilarious.

21:53.652 --> 21:57.028
You guys mind if I borrow him for a minute?

21:57.154 --> 21:58.651
- Go ahead.
- Hmm.

21:58.652 --> 22:00.651
Uh, remind me to tell
you guys about the time

22:00.652 --> 22:02.195
Queen Noir hit on me when I...

22:02.320 --> 22:04.612
I can't believe fucking
Adlard is still alive.

22:04.652 --> 22:05.651
What?

22:05.652 --> 22:07.651
Okay, I know it's hard for you,

22:07.652 --> 22:08.651
but could you maybe not make yourself

22:08.652 --> 22:10.651
the center of attention right now?

22:10.652 --> 22:11.651
You think I'm sitting in this dump

22:11.652 --> 22:13.651
- drinking this shit whiskey because I need attention?
- Hmm, yeah.

22:13.652 --> 22:15.651
I tell these stories because these cops

22:15.652 --> 22:16.651
- need to hear them.
- Bullshit.

22:16.652 --> 22:18.651
They remind us who we are.

22:18.652 --> 22:20.651
Why we all took an oath and
put our asses on the line

22:20.652 --> 22:22.651
to do this job.

22:22.652 --> 22:24.651
I don't know what they
taught you over in sheriff's,

22:24.652 --> 22:26.651
but the LAPD has a long history

22:26.652 --> 22:28.651
that most cops are proud to be a part of.

22:28.652 --> 22:31.651
Especially, at a time like this.

22:31.652 --> 22:32.651
I'm sorry if you can't see that.

22:32.652 --> 22:34.651
Hey, Waldo!

22:34.652 --> 22:36.028
We wanna hear about the Queen.

22:36.195 --> 22:37.487
You got it, Davie!

22:37.612 --> 22:38.652
You're always welcome to join us.

22:38.653 --> 22:40.651
So, so, she says to me, she says,

22:40.652 --> 22:43.092
"Waldo," she says, "Oh, I've
heard things about you people... "

22:45.652 --> 22:46.652
Is it real?

22:47.652 --> 22:48.820
Yes.

22:49.652 --> 22:51.652
Part of a dwindling supply.

22:52.652 --> 22:54.652
Why are you giving it to me?

22:55.652 --> 22:57.651
You want your powers, don't you?

22:57.652 --> 23:00.652
Yeah, but Johnny said it's dangerous.

23:01.652 --> 23:03.651
It might kill me.

23:03.652 --> 23:05.652
Not if you're really a Power.

23:09.652 --> 23:11.651
- Good luck.
- Wait, Simons, please...

23:11.652 --> 23:13.652
I mean, does Johnny know?

23:14.487 --> 23:16.651
That I've given you Sway?

23:16.652 --> 23:18.652
No. I'd prefer to keep it that way.

23:20.237 --> 23:23.652
I'll never tell him. I
swear. You can trust me.

23:24.987 --> 23:28.652
I trust that you care what
Johnny thinks of you very much.

23:31.652 --> 23:34.651
It's not that he doesn't
believe that I'm really...

23:34.652 --> 23:37.651
That's not why he doesn't
want me to take it.

23:37.652 --> 23:40.651
I know it's because he cares about me.

23:40.652 --> 23:42.651
But I can't just sit
around waiting for my powers

23:42.652 --> 23:44.652
if there's something I can try.

23:46.652 --> 23:47.652
Right?

23:51.652 --> 23:54.362
When Johnny conceived Sway,

23:54.652 --> 23:56.652
he needed a test subject.

23:57.652 --> 23:59.529
He found me.

24:00.652 --> 24:02.652
He said I might die.

24:03.652 --> 24:05.652
But he promised I wouldn't die alone.

24:06.652 --> 24:09.652
He said I would never be alone again.

24:12.652 --> 24:14.320
It was risky.

24:14.445 --> 24:15.652
And painful.

24:17.652 --> 24:19.070
But he let me decide what I was,

24:19.195 --> 24:21.652
and was not, willing to do.

24:22.652 --> 24:24.652
You should have the same options.

24:34.112 --> 24:36.652
Well, drinks are free, so

24:37.652 --> 24:38.651
I got them covered.

24:38.652 --> 24:40.652
Thank you.

24:43.652 --> 24:45.652
That's the great equalizer, huh?

24:45.736 --> 24:48.651
Yep, that's what he says.

24:48.652 --> 24:51.651
Well, isn't that just so Harley.

24:51.652 --> 24:53.651
Build a bomb, give it to
the world and get drunk.

24:53.652 --> 24:56.195
No, no, no, no, it's not a bomb, Janice.

24:56.362 --> 24:57.945
We really need this.

24:58.070 --> 25:00.651
It'll give the Powers a
reason to stay in line.

25:00.652 --> 25:03.651
It is a bomb, Christian.

25:03.652 --> 25:05.652
And it doesn't discriminate.

25:05.695 --> 25:08.529
It's only as good as the
people who are dropping it.

25:08.652 --> 25:10.652
That's us! That's Powers division.

25:14.571 --> 25:16.652
Well, isn't that reassuring.

25:18.571 --> 25:20.651
I got them back, Jan.

25:20.652 --> 25:21.652
What?

25:21.652 --> 25:24.652
At the Shaft, I had my powers again.

25:25.652 --> 25:27.651
When I touched Wolfe, I could feel 'em,

25:27.652 --> 25:29.651
so I grabbed hold and it was like...

25:29.652 --> 25:31.651
it was like I was sucking my powers

25:31.652 --> 25:32.652
back out of him.

25:35.652 --> 25:37.652
You got Wolfe, not Zora.

25:39.652 --> 25:42.651
Yeah. Yeah.

25:42.652 --> 25:44.652
When I picked him up, he felt like nothing.

25:44.736 --> 25:46.651
I threw him through the floor.

25:46.652 --> 25:49.651
And then, I tossed him into his cell.

25:49.652 --> 25:51.651
But when he was under the Drainer,

25:51.652 --> 25:53.651
my power disappeared.

25:53.652 --> 25:56.445
I felt myself being emptied out.

25:57.028 --> 26:00.651
Yeah, all of it. Fuck!

26:00.652 --> 26:02.652
It happened again!

26:03.652 --> 26:06.362
I remember there was a moment

26:06.487 --> 26:08.652
where I went down and I
remember it distinctly...

26:09.652 --> 26:14.651
I felt him coming for me
and I thought, that's it.

26:14.652 --> 26:16.651
There's, there's, there's no one.

26:16.652 --> 26:19.154
There's no one to stop him now.

26:20.652 --> 26:22.279
But you were there,

26:22.736 --> 26:24.652
weren't you?

26:28.903 --> 26:30.652
I...

26:31.652 --> 26:34.653
I don't know what happened,
but I'm connected to him.

26:36.652 --> 26:39.651
I got him back before, there
must be a way to do it again.

26:39.652 --> 26:41.651
Have you felt anything since that night?

26:41.652 --> 26:43.651
No! And Wolfe is just sitting there,

26:43.652 --> 26:45.651
under that fucking Drainer.

26:45.652 --> 26:47.652
All that power... there has to be a way.

26:56.652 --> 26:59.652
If that's what you miss and that's
why you want your powers back,

27:01.320 --> 27:03.651
you haven't changed as much as I'd hoped.

27:03.652 --> 27:05.903
No. No. If that's what I wanted,

27:06.070 --> 27:07.710
I could just tell everybody what happened.

27:09.652 --> 27:10.652
Then why don't you?

27:14.237 --> 27:16.112
We'd really love it if you
could make an appearance.

27:16.237 --> 27:18.404
Of course! Absolutely!

27:18.529 --> 27:19.651
Don't make any promises.

27:19.652 --> 27:22.651
The kids will be thrilled
and it is a great cause.

27:22.652 --> 27:24.651
It is, and we'll check Zora's schedule

27:24.652 --> 27:25.652
and we'll get back to you. Thanks.

27:25.736 --> 27:28.028
- Thanks.
- We're gonna head over to the families now.

27:28.154 --> 27:29.651
- Okay.
- And then you...

27:29.652 --> 27:31.651
- Oh, God, Candace!
- Oh, Patty. Hi.

27:31.652 --> 27:33.651
I can't believe they're really gone.

27:33.652 --> 27:36.028
First Brian and now Sol.

27:36.195 --> 27:37.612
You know we have to get together...

27:37.652 --> 27:38.732
I'm so sorry for your loss.

27:39.652 --> 27:41.651
Thank you.

27:41.652 --> 27:42.945
We'll talk.

27:43.652 --> 27:46.652
Oh, I am so sorry.

27:46.653 --> 27:49.651
I know this is a hard time
but it's really gonna be okay.

27:49.652 --> 27:53.112
- You just keep your head up.
- Oh... Okay. Okay.

27:53.237 --> 27:54.651
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

27:54.652 --> 27:56.651
Uh, I don't wanna bother you,

27:56.652 --> 27:58.651
but would you, uh...

27:58.652 --> 28:00.651
Oh! Of course!

28:00.652 --> 28:01.652
Be right back.

28:01.652 --> 28:03.652
Can't say no to a fan.

28:04.652 --> 28:06.028
Hey. Hi.

28:07.778 --> 28:11.651
We thought you'd wanna
stay away from this one.

28:11.652 --> 28:13.651
- Yeah. Yeah, well...
- You okay?

28:13.652 --> 28:17.651
Believe me. I wouldn't
be here if I had a choice.

28:17.652 --> 28:19.237
She's a client?

28:19.362 --> 28:21.651
The publicist who was handling
her dropped the ball at the Shaft.

28:21.652 --> 28:24.651
No, shit. And you were there to pick it up!

28:24.652 --> 28:27.651
Campbell Academy doesn't pay for itself.

28:27.652 --> 28:28.651
Art school won't either, you know?

28:28.652 --> 28:31.651
Krispin needs me earning, not
being fussy about how I get clients.

28:31.652 --> 28:33.651
I'm sorry, I didn't mean your...

28:33.652 --> 28:35.651
You're doing what needs to be done.

28:35.652 --> 28:37.651
It's like having another teenager.

28:37.652 --> 28:40.320
How is he? Krisp?

28:40.445 --> 28:42.652
The Master of Secrets? I wish I knew.

28:44.652 --> 28:46.320
He's trying to act normal,

28:46.487 --> 28:48.652
but it's not him. Not really.

28:49.652 --> 28:52.487
Is beer with politicians acceptable?

28:52.652 --> 28:53.651
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

28:53.652 --> 28:54.651
- Let me get a picture.
- Sure.

28:54.652 --> 28:56.651
- I gotta go do my job.
- Sure. Go.

28:56.652 --> 28:58.651
Here I'll do it for you.

28:58.652 --> 28:59.651
Excuse me.

28:59.652 --> 29:01.112
I promise. I'll bring her right back.

29:01.279 --> 29:02.652
I'm sorry.

29:03.652 --> 29:05.651
Everyone in here has

29:05.652 --> 29:07.651
the Where Are The Powers That Be app.

29:07.652 --> 29:09.651
Pretty soon, all we're gonna be looking at

29:09.652 --> 29:12.651
are pics of "Zora
partying at cop memorial."

29:12.652 --> 29:13.692
That's not what I'm doing.

29:13.736 --> 29:15.651
But that's how it's gonna look.

29:15.652 --> 29:18.651
You told me you wanted to be an A-lister.

29:18.652 --> 29:20.652
Model yourself after one.

29:29.652 --> 29:32.820
You know what? I gave my condolences.

29:34.112 --> 29:35.652
I'm out.

29:36.862 --> 29:39.651
Oh, my God! You're doing something

29:39.652 --> 29:42.651
totally nonviolent, making
a political statement,

29:42.652 --> 29:45.651
and this Power just decides
you should be stopped?

29:45.652 --> 29:47.651
And that's when people get hurt.

29:47.652 --> 29:49.651
Yeah.

29:49.652 --> 29:50.903
I mean, they were all okay, you know?

29:51.070 --> 29:52.978
At least she stopped to help or whatever.

29:53.003 --> 29:57.651
That's not the point!
That was a major crash.

29:57.652 --> 29:58.820
What if someone had been
standing on the sidewalk?

29:58.945 --> 30:01.651
- That'd be fucked up.
- Or dead!

30:01.652 --> 30:03.651
Just like your dad and my cousin.

30:03.652 --> 30:05.651
And now, people can see that.

30:05.652 --> 30:07.651
With your video and my skills,

30:07.652 --> 30:10.651
everyone is gonna be talking about us.

30:10.652 --> 30:13.651
Yeah, you really think people are
gonna watch a video of some kid tagging?

30:13.652 --> 30:16.651
That is so not what this video is gonna be.

30:16.652 --> 30:18.652
Who helped you film it anyway?

30:19.652 --> 30:21.652
Uh, just a friend.

30:23.652 --> 30:26.652
Thank you! There's more
where that came from.

30:31.652 --> 30:34.652
Look! She's so cool!
She's helping that guy!

30:46.404 --> 30:47.652
I wanna talk to you.

30:48.652 --> 30:50.652
Another drink and I won't care.

30:51.736 --> 30:53.652
Hey.

30:55.652 --> 30:57.651
We've covered it already.

30:57.652 --> 30:59.651
I fucked up. I am a fuck up.

30:59.652 --> 31:01.651
Could you, for a moment,

31:01.652 --> 31:03.652
modulate your fucking self-absorption.

31:04.652 --> 31:06.487
I... Hey.

31:09.652 --> 31:12.695
My dad, he loves telling that story.

31:12.820 --> 31:14.651
I know.

31:14.652 --> 31:16.651
He always leaves out the part about

31:16.652 --> 31:19.651
the half million in cash that went missing.

31:19.652 --> 31:20.862
What?

31:21.028 --> 31:23.651
Yeah, how do you think he
bought the big mansion of his?

31:23.652 --> 31:26.651
On his pension?

31:26.652 --> 31:28.651
His strike team wasn't even
supposed to be in that house.

31:28.652 --> 31:30.652
He went in on some bullshit probable cause.

31:30.653 --> 31:32.651
No real back up.

31:32.652 --> 31:34.945
He knew the money was there.

31:35.070 --> 31:36.652
Two of his men died.

31:38.652 --> 31:40.487
Does he know you know?

31:40.652 --> 31:42.651
Hell no.

31:42.652 --> 31:45.651
Everyone's always telling
me what a hero my dad is.

31:45.652 --> 31:48.651
But real heroes?

31:48.652 --> 31:50.652
They don't fuck their partners, Walker.

31:51.652 --> 31:53.651
What do you want me to do?

31:53.652 --> 31:55.651
Write a report? Tell Cross I took Sway?

31:55.652 --> 31:58.651
Fuck Cross! You're supposed to tell me.

31:58.652 --> 32:00.903
Not only did you take Sway

32:01.028 --> 32:02.651
and leave me with no back up,

32:02.652 --> 32:05.651
you locked me in a cell so I
couldn't back you up either?

32:05.652 --> 32:07.945
You turned me into a shitty partner.

32:08.070 --> 32:10.651
I just... I didn't think it
was fair to ask you to do that.

32:10.652 --> 32:13.651
So you didn't ask at all? You just decided?

32:13.652 --> 32:15.652
We're either working together or we're not.

32:18.652 --> 32:20.651
Come on! Come on! Come on!

32:20.652 --> 32:23.651
All right, here we go. And... up!

Come inside my parlor.

32:46.652 --> 32:48.529
- Christian!
- Hey.

32:48.652 --> 32:49.945
Detective Walker.

32:51.652 --> 32:52.652
I still can't get used to that.

32:52.695 --> 32:54.862
You need a hand or an arm?

32:54.987 --> 32:57.651
An arm? Cute.

32:57.652 --> 32:59.651
Funny man.

32:59.652 --> 33:03.651
You know, when he lost his powers,

33:03.652 --> 33:06.651
I offered to make him his own armor.

33:06.652 --> 33:08.651
You know what he said to me?

33:08.652 --> 33:11.651
I don't want to end up like you.

33:11.652 --> 33:13.651
You one-legged fuck.

33:13.652 --> 33:15.362
Okay, time to go. Come on.

33:15.487 --> 33:17.651
The offer still stands, Christian.

33:17.652 --> 33:19.651
We're gonna need all hands on deck.

33:19.652 --> 33:21.652
Sure, get up. Let's go.

33:23.652 --> 33:24.651
Get up.

33:24.652 --> 33:27.651
Are you helping?

33:27.652 --> 33:29.651
Shit. I can't lift him.

33:29.652 --> 33:31.651
Half his skeleton's fucking titanium.

33:31.652 --> 33:32.987
You have no idea what's coming.

33:33.154 --> 33:37.279
Someday, Cross is gonna have to tell you.

33:37.445 --> 33:38.651
What's coming?

33:38.652 --> 33:41.652
Black Swan, it's coming.

33:43.652 --> 33:45.651
It's coming soon. And the Drainer?

33:45.652 --> 33:50.070
All it can do is slow the Black Swan down.

33:50.652 --> 33:52.651
That doesn't matter.

33:52.652 --> 33:54.651
He's coming.

33:54.652 --> 33:55.695
Or she.

33:57.652 --> 33:59.652
May be already here.

34:00.652 --> 34:01.695
Harley.

34:01.862 --> 34:04.651
Hey, Harley.

34:04.652 --> 34:06.651
Are you serious about the Black...

34:06.652 --> 34:08.652
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

34:10.652 --> 34:12.650
Who is the Black Swan?

34:12.652 --> 34:14.650
What is that?

34:14.652 --> 34:16.650
- ♪ We're bound for the border ♪
- Oh, Jesus.

34:16.652 --> 34:18.652
♪ As soldiers of fortune,
we fight for no country ♪

34:18.652 --> 34:21.650
Harley, enough now.
I'm gonna take you home.

34:21.652 --> 34:22.652
Oh.

34:23.652 --> 34:25.652
Just like old times.

34:26.652 --> 34:29.650
- No, not quite.
- What?

34:29.652 --> 34:32.652
It was before your time,
Christian. Come on, Harley.

34:33.987 --> 34:35.652
Are you serious?

34:36.652 --> 34:38.650
You and Harley had a...

34:38.652 --> 34:40.650
For how long?

34:40.652 --> 34:43.650
Hey, do you have any idea
what he was talking about?

34:43.652 --> 34:44.650
Whatever the Black Swan is,

34:44.652 --> 34:47.027
he certainly hasn't told me about it.

34:48.652 --> 34:51.650
But then again the men in
my life, and their secrets.

34:51.652 --> 34:53.652
I could write a book, couldn't I?

34:56.652 --> 35:00.652
I don't want to take credit
for capturing Wolfe because I...

35:01.652 --> 35:05.652
I don't want to be the guy
who lost his powers again.

35:07.652 --> 35:09.652
Then fight for them.

35:12.652 --> 35:15.651
All right, help me to get him out of here.

35:15.652 --> 35:17.652
You don't need my help.

35:18.652 --> 35:19.651
I can carry the weight.

35:19.652 --> 35:22.652
I need an extra set of
hands for the balance.

35:28.652 --> 35:30.651
Thanks. Thanks.

35:30.652 --> 35:33.651
Phew! That was... Um...

35:33.652 --> 35:35.651
When this thing winds down me

35:35.652 --> 35:38.651
and some of the brass are
headed over to The Cozy.

35:38.652 --> 35:40.651
It'd be good for you to get some face time.

35:40.652 --> 35:41.651
Oh, you're so full of shit.

35:41.652 --> 35:43.651
Excuse me?

35:43.652 --> 35:46.651
That story you been telling all day?

35:46.652 --> 35:47.652
I know.

35:49.652 --> 35:50.652
I know.

35:53.652 --> 35:55.778
I've done a lot of shitty
things in my life, too, dad.

35:55.903 --> 35:58.612
But at least I own up to them.

35:59.612 --> 36:00.652
- You done?
- No.

36:01.778 --> 36:04.652
I'll have my things out
of the house by tonight.

36:17.652 --> 36:19.651
Hey!

36:19.652 --> 36:22.279
Could've used the door. My mom's not home.

36:22.445 --> 36:23.736
Well, that's no fun.

36:32.652 --> 36:35.651
Um, I thought maybe we could hang out.

36:35.652 --> 36:36.652
Yeah, so did I.

36:38.652 --> 36:40.651
I came back, all right?

36:40.652 --> 36:42.651
If you're going to jump
every time Johnny Royalle

36:42.652 --> 36:44.651
texts you to hook up then I
don't exactly want to hang out.

36:44.652 --> 36:46.652
You think I'm...

36:48.652 --> 36:50.652
- Fuck off.
- What am I supposed to think?

36:50.695 --> 36:53.154
Every time I come here,
I'm taking a giant risk.

36:53.279 --> 36:54.651
The police are looking for me

36:54.652 --> 36:57.651
and the only reason they haven't
found me is because of Johnny.

36:57.652 --> 37:00.651
- I'm sorry, I...
- Some Powers really are good, Krispin!

37:00.652 --> 37:02.903
Johnny's the best friend I've ever had.

37:03.028 --> 37:05.651
But you're too insecure
and jealous to handle that.

37:05.652 --> 37:08.652
Don't, don't! Look, I'm sorry.

37:09.652 --> 37:11.652
I'm not jealous, you know, I just...

37:14.237 --> 37:15.652
It sucked that you left.

37:27.652 --> 37:28.652
There.

37:30.652 --> 37:33.651
I hate this fucking game.

37:33.652 --> 37:35.652
- You want to be alone?
- No!

37:39.195 --> 37:40.652
Never.

37:48.652 --> 37:49.695
Help me.

37:50.652 --> 37:53.820
He's okay. He's gonna be okay.

37:59.652 --> 38:01.651
Take me home.

38:01.652 --> 38:02.652
I want to go home.

38:06.652 --> 38:09.651
- Why did you do that to him?
- I had to.

38:09.652 --> 38:12.651
You tried to take the Sway out.

38:12.652 --> 38:14.612
I would've been alone again.

38:14.652 --> 38:16.751
I made the Sway from Wolfe's blood.

38:16.752 --> 38:18.651
I know that. So fucking what?

38:18.652 --> 38:20.652
It let Walker take Wolfe's power.

38:20.653 --> 38:23.651
It's changing people.

38:23.652 --> 38:26.237
I don't know what else it might do.

38:26.404 --> 38:28.529
And I can't take it back.

38:43.320 --> 38:44.652
I love this part.

38:49.652 --> 38:51.651
Can I tell you something?

38:51.652 --> 38:52.652
Yeah.

38:53.652 --> 38:56.652
I have to pee.

38:59.652 --> 39:01.651
It's down the hall and to the left.

39:01.652 --> 39:03.652
Be right back.

39:18.652 --> 39:20.903
Go to showusyourpowers.com.

39:21.070 --> 39:22.651
I got to call you back later.

39:22.652 --> 39:23.652
Just get online.

39:23.652 --> 39:25.651
- I hacked the site.
- What?

39:25.652 --> 39:27.651
I made a Chaotic Chick rick roll.

39:27.652 --> 39:30.651
People think those drivers from
the car wreck actually died.

39:30.652 --> 39:32.651
Wait, what do you mean?

39:32.652 --> 39:33.651
The comments are amazing.

39:33.652 --> 39:35.651
They're so anti-Powers.

39:35.652 --> 39:36.651
But nobody died.

39:36.652 --> 39:39.651
I just edited the end.

39:39.652 --> 39:41.571
It's working, Krispin.

39:41.652 --> 39:44.651
Our video has 30,000 plays already.

39:44.652 --> 39:47.651
We're getting through to people.

39:47.652 --> 39:48.903
Shit.

39:52.903 --> 39:54.951
- Calista, wait.
- Krispin?

39:56.052 --> 39:57.652
Krispin, what's going on?

40:00.820 --> 40:03.237
Emile.

40:04.652 --> 40:05.652
Are you okay?

40:09.652 --> 40:11.651
I'm sorry, I, I, I didn't mean to, um...

40:11.652 --> 40:13.404
What is it?

40:14.652 --> 40:16.651
Can it wait?

40:16.652 --> 40:18.651
Just this once can it fucking wait?

40:18.652 --> 40:20.651
What's going on?

40:20.652 --> 40:23.445
Harley just said you
don't know what's coming,

40:23.612 --> 40:27.651
and then he started going
on about the Black Swan.

40:27.652 --> 40:30.651
- Is this about...
- Harley has his own beliefs.

40:30.652 --> 40:31.652
Yeah?

40:32.652 --> 40:34.945
Yeah? Like... like what?

40:36.652 --> 40:38.695
They're different from
mine. You'll have to ask him.

40:44.652 --> 40:48.279
Emile, if you know
something about the Drainer,

40:48.445 --> 40:52.445
uh, every cop in this
division deserves to know.

40:52.571 --> 40:55.028
What exactly do you
want to know, Detective?

40:55.652 --> 40:57.651
The future?

40:57.652 --> 40:59.320
Get in line.

40:59.487 --> 41:00.778
I want to know what's going on.

41:00.903 --> 41:03.651
If there's some threat
that we can be preparing...

41:03.652 --> 41:05.652
Here's what I believe!

41:06.652 --> 41:08.652
You can prepare your soul.

41:09.652 --> 41:11.529
That's it.

41:11.652 --> 41:14.651
No one can be ready for the rest of it.

41:14.652 --> 41:16.652
Not even Harley's smart enough to do that.

41:22.652 --> 41:24.651
Fucker doesn't deserve fucking rights.

41:24.652 --> 41:27.154
The judicial system is run by
a bunch of dickless maggots.

41:27.320 --> 41:28.651
- Look at it.
- Shh, take it...

41:28.652 --> 41:29.903
Oh, fuck you, dead man.

41:30.028 --> 41:31.653
Get your geriatric hands off me.

41:31.778 --> 41:34.320
- Hey, hey, whoa, hey.
- That's not funny anymore.

41:34.487 --> 41:35.651
Oh, it's fucking hilarious.

41:35.652 --> 41:37.651
Where the fuck were you down there, anyway?

41:37.652 --> 41:38.651
Where the fuck were you?

41:38.652 --> 41:39.651
Just calm down.

41:39.652 --> 41:43.651
- Calm down.
- Oh, shit. The convenient cripple speaks.

41:43.652 --> 41:45.987
Your face should be on the wall with
the rest of the dead people, old man.

41:46.112 --> 41:48.651
Hey! It should be and you know it!

41:48.652 --> 41:50.651
Hey, get off.

41:50.652 --> 41:52.651
Stop! Knock it off!

41:52.652 --> 41:55.279
- Hey! Stop it!
- It's him, man.

41:55.445 --> 41:58.154
- Here comes the big swinging dick.
- What?

41:58.279 --> 42:01.651
You really got off on
being a Power, didn't you?

42:01.652 --> 42:03.195
You know what I think?

42:03.320 --> 42:06.651
I think we should lock up every
Power on the planet and drain them.

42:06.652 --> 42:08.652
The world would be better off without them.

42:10.652 --> 42:12.651
Hey, if it wasn't for us,

42:12.652 --> 42:15.651
Wolfe would've killed
everyone, you worthless fuck.

42:15.652 --> 42:17.651
Hey, guys. Might want to see this.

42:17.652 --> 42:21.652
When I was caught in
this Drainer, I panicked.

42:22.529 --> 42:24.652
I had never felt so small.

42:25.652 --> 42:28.404
So desperate.

42:29.652 --> 42:30.652
Powerless.

42:30.652 --> 42:34.651
And then, I had a moment
of monstrous clarity.

42:34.652 --> 42:38.651
I understood, in my powerlessness,

42:38.652 --> 42:42.652
I understood the true horror
of everything I had done.

42:43.652 --> 42:45.945
And I wished then...

42:47.652 --> 42:49.652
... let this be the end.

42:51.652 --> 42:54.652
Let me not live with this knowledge.

42:56.652 --> 42:57.987
This horror.

42:59.652 --> 43:04.651
But my attorneys inform me I
cannot escape to that dark country.

43:04.652 --> 43:08.651
There is no death penalty here.

43:08.652 --> 43:11.652
Only when my powers
are drained permanently,

43:12.652 --> 43:14.652
will the world be safe.

43:16.652 --> 43:19.070
This is my deepest wish.

43:19.237 --> 43:22.652
And I humbly ask the courts to grant it.
