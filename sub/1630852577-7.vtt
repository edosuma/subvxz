00:06.103 --> 00:08.241
Previously
onRuPaul's Drag Race...

00:08.241 --> 00:11.068
You need to create
unforgettable looks

00:11.068 --> 00:14.965
using only the materials
found in these packages.

00:14.965 --> 00:16.206
I really just wanna
coordinate an outfit

00:16.206 --> 00:18.896
with, like, the little,
like, blow-up doll.

00:18.896 --> 00:20.896
Ehh.

00:21.965 --> 00:23.793
Jasmine Kennedie.

00:23.793 --> 00:25.551
I think this look
needs to breathe.

00:25.551 --> 00:27.310
Maddy Morphosis.

00:27.310 --> 00:29.448
It's just kind of hard
to look at.

00:29.448 --> 00:31.689
-Jorgeous.
-Baby, you turned it.

00:31.689 --> 00:34.689
Con-drag-ulations. You are the
winner of this week's challenge.

00:36.103 --> 00:37.793
I definitely don't think
it's top material.

00:39.034 --> 00:41.620
Jasmine Kennedie,
shantay you stay.

00:41.620 --> 00:44.896
Maddy, sashay away.

00:54.620 --> 00:57.724
Oh, well, that was easy.

00:57.724 --> 01:00.137
-All right.
-Girl.

01:00.137 --> 01:01.862
I am very happy
seeing Maddy's message,

01:01.862 --> 01:05.206
just because I did
what I said I was gonna do,

01:05.206 --> 01:07.000
and I wasn't lying when I said
I was gonna send you home, girl.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.448
I sent you home.

01:09.448 --> 01:12.000
"Don't be afraid to be yourself.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.344
Be kind and be stupid."

01:15.344 --> 01:17.000
-Yes, Maddy!
-Yay, Maddy!

01:17.000 --> 01:19.517
Hey, I don't feel--

01:19.517 --> 01:22.413
like, we clearly had a moment.

01:22.413 --> 01:24.724
-Yes.
-We had a moment.

01:24.724 --> 01:27.448
I hope you give the second-best
lip sync of the night.

01:27.448 --> 01:29.344
I'm not worried
about this lip sync.

01:29.344 --> 01:31.103
-You should.
-About what?

01:31.103 --> 01:33.482
Like, why you should
be worried about me?

01:33.482 --> 01:34.724
You're in the bottom as well.

01:34.724 --> 01:35.931
I'm going to destroy you
in this lip sync.

01:35.931 --> 01:37.551
Set your fucking cocktail down,

01:37.551 --> 01:40.413
because I am not worried,
period.

01:41.655 --> 01:44.551
I think I needed to lip sync.

01:44.551 --> 01:46.482
I feel like I show myself
best when I'm performing.

01:46.482 --> 01:48.137
Jasmine, you did kill
that lip sync.

01:48.137 --> 01:50.379
It was, like, so hot.

01:50.379 --> 01:53.172
I think Jasmine right now
is feeling invigorated.

01:53.172 --> 01:54.620
This was her first time
being in the bottom,

01:54.620 --> 01:56.172
and she had talked a big game

01:56.172 --> 01:58.931
about being a good lip syncer,
and she did deliver.

01:58.931 --> 02:01.758
I mean, we were all,
like, holy shit.

02:01.758 --> 02:04.034
Maddy, we all love you.

02:04.034 --> 02:05.103
Yes, we love you, Maddy!

02:05.103 --> 02:07.448
Now clean
that damn mirror.

02:07.448 --> 02:09.000
I think she also has to be happy

02:09.000 --> 02:11.551
that she gets to have
the last word

02:11.551 --> 02:13.758
after that fight with Maddy.

02:13.758 --> 02:15.517
We know Jasmine
needs the last word.

02:15.517 --> 02:19.137
You guys all know, like,
I was excited as fuck

02:19.137 --> 02:20.931
because I was, like,
in the top last week,

02:20.931 --> 02:24.034
and so this week I was,
like, okay, here we go.

02:24.034 --> 02:25.379
Here we go! Aah!

02:26.413 --> 02:27.931
I, of course,

02:27.931 --> 02:30.379
have more of a fire
under my ass now.

02:30.379 --> 02:32.103
So watch the fuck out,
everyone.

02:32.103 --> 02:34.137
Okay!

02:34.137 --> 02:36.344
However,
congratulations, Jorgeous.

02:36.344 --> 02:37.931
Oh, my God! Thank you.

02:37.931 --> 02:41.241
It feels like I'm, like, here.

02:41.241 --> 02:42.965
Like, I made my mark,
I made my stamp.

02:42.965 --> 02:44.517
You did.

02:44.517 --> 02:45.758
I am very proud of you,
Jorgeous.

02:45.758 --> 02:47.103
That is the sexiest napkin

02:47.103 --> 02:48.482
I've ever seen
go down the runway.

02:48.482 --> 02:50.551
Come on, bitch, get out!

02:50.551 --> 02:52.482
Ooh!

02:52.482 --> 02:56.689
I don't think Jorgeous
deserved to be in the top,

02:56.689 --> 02:59.896
and when I see her
getting all this praise

02:59.896 --> 03:02.413
and then I'm just safe,

03:02.413 --> 03:05.034
it just feels like a little bit
of a slap in the face.

03:05.034 --> 03:07.862
I am not happy to be safe.

03:07.862 --> 03:10.586
I spent time making the base,

03:10.586 --> 03:12.206
I spent time making
little accessories,

03:12.206 --> 03:15.206
I spent time making
fucking glasses. Whatever.

03:15.206 --> 03:17.620
Sorry to the girls that
glued stuff onto a bodysuit,

03:17.620 --> 03:19.689
but it's like
I felt like I did a lot

03:19.689 --> 03:21.241
compared to some other
people, so...

03:21.241 --> 03:23.655
-Name names.
-Yeah.

03:23.655 --> 03:25.000
I mean, Jorgeous.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.482
Yes, it was--it was--
it was just fabric.

03:27.482 --> 03:31.896
I created a garment
from literally nothing,

03:31.896 --> 03:34.724
so I did think I was
at least gonna be in the top.

03:34.724 --> 03:36.586
If you wanted the judges'
critiques that bad, bitch,

03:36.586 --> 03:38.206
they could have read you,

03:38.206 --> 03:40.862
because you did
the same makeup last week.

03:40.862 --> 03:43.551
And at least my costume
didn't have fucking wrinkles

03:43.551 --> 03:45.586
in the damn yellow part, girl.

03:45.586 --> 03:47.655
You didn't think to
steam out those bedsheets

03:47.655 --> 03:49.172
before stepping out
on the main stage, girl?

03:49.172 --> 03:50.448
Like, really?

03:50.448 --> 03:51.586
I'm sorry if I hurt
anybody's feelings,

03:51.586 --> 03:53.034
but that's just how I felt.

03:53.034 --> 03:55.206
That's my emotions,
I'm sticking to it,

03:55.206 --> 03:57.586
and I'll just have to beat
your all's asses next week.

03:57.586 --> 04:01.379
Trust me,
I am 100% focused.

04:03.103 --> 04:06.724
I think Jorgeous is a little
irritated with me right now.

04:06.724 --> 04:08.034
Maybe I'm not giving her

04:08.034 --> 04:11.000
all the praise that
she thinks she deserves,

04:11.000 --> 04:12.689
but she just won $5,000

04:12.689 --> 04:14.724
and a big congratulations
from RuPaul,

04:14.724 --> 04:16.931
so why does she need it
from me?

04:19.724 --> 04:21.517
-Jorgeous, congratulations.
-Thank you so much.

04:21.517 --> 04:23.241
What's wrong, though?
You don't seem happy.

04:23.241 --> 04:25.310
Yeah, I'm, like--
It's so annoying.

04:25.310 --> 04:27.827
Yes, I won, but it just
makes it seem like

04:27.827 --> 04:31.793
I didn't work as hard
as other people did.

04:31.793 --> 04:35.310
I did put my all into,
like, this fucking look.

04:35.310 --> 04:37.862
Girl, doubt me
all y'all want, bitch.

04:37.862 --> 04:42.206
I'm just gonna do me because,
bitch, I came here to win.

04:42.206 --> 04:43.758
Your drag is not the same
as anybody else's,

04:43.758 --> 04:45.965
so if someone's mad
that it's a "napkin,"

04:45.965 --> 04:48.034
that's their problem,
not yours.

04:48.034 --> 04:52.448
It just was, like, y'all
are so mad, bitch, do better.

04:52.448 --> 04:54.793
Daya is jealous,
and I think she is boo-boo hurt

04:54.793 --> 04:56.137
because she was not in the top,

04:56.137 --> 04:57.448
and, girl, she shouldn't
have been in the top.

04:57.448 --> 05:00.275
Girl, step it up
and stop being a sourpuss

05:00.275 --> 05:01.965
and stop giving Crystal Methyd.

05:04.034 --> 05:07.620
I made a garment from scratch!

05:08.758 --> 05:10.827
-Bitch!

05:10.827 --> 05:11.931
Ugh!

05:13.586 --> 05:15.413
The winner
ofRuPaul's Drag Race

05:15.413 --> 05:16.896
receives a one-year supply

05:16.896 --> 05:19.379
of Anastasia Beverly Hills
cosmetics,

05:19.379 --> 05:24.482
and a grand prize of $100,000,
powered by Cash App.

05:24.482 --> 05:27.655
With extra-special guest judge
Ts Madison.

05:37.310 --> 05:39.344
-Ooh, thank you!
-Pretty fine, baby.

05:39.344 --> 05:41.172
Another day in the werkroom.

05:41.172 --> 05:42.413
After the last challenge,

05:42.413 --> 05:44.172
Daya was making me feel

05:44.172 --> 05:46.965
like I didn't deserve the win.

05:46.965 --> 05:49.137
But today, I don't give a damn.

05:49.137 --> 05:51.620
I won, and I could build
on that.

05:51.620 --> 05:53.206
This is the confidence
that I needed,

05:53.206 --> 05:55.034
and I'm so happy right now.

05:55.034 --> 05:56.517
How are you guys feeling,
ladies?

05:56.517 --> 05:58.517
-Good!
-Good, bitch!

05:58.517 --> 05:59.758
Yeah, I know you feeling good.

05:59.758 --> 06:01.551
Oh, yes, ma'am!

06:01.551 --> 06:03.413
Congratulations, Miss Jorgeous.

06:03.413 --> 06:05.172
Oh, yes, fuckin' ma'am.

06:05.172 --> 06:06.344
I'm like, oh, my God,
I won a challenge.

06:06.344 --> 06:08.241
Like, who am I?

06:08.241 --> 06:10.103
And I know some girls
didn't agree

06:10.103 --> 06:12.517
with me being in the top,
but it's okay.

06:12.517 --> 06:13.517
All that matters
is what the judges say, baby.

06:13.517 --> 06:14.827
Yes, exactly.

06:14.827 --> 06:20.965
I just wanted to apologize
to Jorgeous,

06:20.965 --> 06:23.206
because I felt like
me complaining

06:23.206 --> 06:28.517
about not being in the top
overshadowed you and your win.

06:28.517 --> 06:30.000
I know I upset you.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.551
It was just frustrating,
because it didn't feel like

06:31.551 --> 06:34.689
I was supposed to, like, win
and all this stuff, you know?

06:34.689 --> 06:37.862
Because, like--because I did
work hard on my outfit, and--

06:37.862 --> 06:40.862
I genuinely love you
and care about you as a friend,

06:40.862 --> 06:43.413
so as a friend, congratulations.

06:44.689 --> 06:46.896
I hope you accept my apology,

06:46.896 --> 06:50.068
and just know that I love you
and I'm very proud of you.

06:50.068 --> 06:53.068
This apology Daya
is giving to Jorgeous

06:53.068 --> 06:54.448
is faker than my breastplate.

06:56.482 --> 06:58.068
Ooh, girl!

06:58.068 --> 07:00.068
She done already
done had herses.

07:00.068 --> 07:02.379
-Girl, come on.
-Time.

07:02.379 --> 07:03.655
My queens.

07:03.655 --> 07:06.000
-Hello!
-To be part of my dynasty,

07:06.000 --> 07:08.586
you need to put the "D"
in "Alice,"

07:08.586 --> 07:12.275
the "B" in
the "Old and the Beautiful,"

07:12.275 --> 07:15.655
and the "Y" in the
"Hung and the Restless."

07:15.655 --> 07:18.862
Remember,
as the stomach turns,

07:18.862 --> 07:22.379
so do the gays of our lives.

07:23.931 --> 07:25.517
Well, me and Daya definitely
put the "D" in "Dynasty."

07:25.517 --> 07:27.241
-Uh-huh.
-Ha-ha.

07:27.241 --> 07:28.482
It's definitely another
design challenge.

07:28.482 --> 07:30.241
Oh, bitch!

07:32.275 --> 07:34.068
Hello, hello, hello!

07:35.482 --> 07:36.896
She's colorful, bitch!

07:36.896 --> 07:39.068
Ladies!

07:39.068 --> 07:40.517
-Hey!
-Hello!

07:40.517 --> 07:45.310
We are almost halfway through
the race officially.

07:45.310 --> 07:49.172
So if you wanna make it
to the winner's circle,

07:49.172 --> 07:53.000
now is the time to put
the pedal to the what?

07:53.000 --> 07:54.103
-Metal!
-Metal!

07:54.103 --> 07:55.586
That's right.

07:55.586 --> 07:57.172
For this week's maxi-challenge,

07:57.172 --> 08:01.172
you'll be starring
in the new Drag Racedrama,

08:01.172 --> 08:03.655
The Daytona Wind.

08:05.275 --> 08:07.517
This sizzling soap opera

08:07.517 --> 08:12.103
centers around three rival
Drag Racedynasties:

08:12.103 --> 08:13.931
-the Davenports...
-Ooh.

08:13.931 --> 08:16.758
-the O'Haras...

08:16.758 --> 08:17.827
and the Michaels.

08:20.896 --> 08:23.896
I'm thinking, great,
I do go to acting school,

08:23.896 --> 08:26.482
not to put any pressure
on myself here.

08:26.482 --> 08:28.931
But I'm kind of excited.

08:28.931 --> 08:31.655
And later today
you will film your scenes

08:31.655 --> 08:34.758
with one of the most
demanding directors

08:34.758 --> 08:36.896
working in Hollywood today.

08:36.896 --> 08:38.931
Oh, shit.

08:38.931 --> 08:40.137
And that son of a bitch...

08:41.586 --> 08:42.689
...is me.

08:46.413 --> 08:48.034
I'm scared.

08:48.034 --> 08:51.689
Now, in a moment you'll receive
the script for The Daytona Wind.

08:51.689 --> 08:56.137
Jorgeous, you won
the maxi-challenge last week,

08:56.137 --> 08:59.620
so you are in charge
of assigning the roles.

08:59.620 --> 09:01.517
-Ooh!
-Oh!

09:01.517 --> 09:02.862
Okay.

09:02.862 --> 09:04.517
Hey!

09:04.517 --> 09:07.206
Oh, so I get to pick
the roles this time.

09:07.206 --> 09:10.896
I can't wait to see
how this turns out.

09:14.344 --> 09:15.448
Coming up...

09:15.448 --> 09:17.241
I really wanna be
Sierra Michaels.

09:17.241 --> 09:19.206
That's who I wanted to be, too.

09:19.206 --> 09:21.448
Oh, shit, here we go.

09:21.448 --> 09:23.137
Is everybody happy
with their roles?

09:31.448 --> 09:33.413
Ooh! Scripts.

09:33.413 --> 09:35.620
I'm gonna pass them out
for y'all ho's.

09:35.620 --> 09:38.413
This week's maxi-challenge

09:38.413 --> 09:43.206
is to be acting
in a Drag Racedrama,

09:43.206 --> 09:45.689
Daytona Wind,

09:45.689 --> 09:47.655
which is like
a soap opera challenge.

09:47.655 --> 09:50.551
Dang, those are thick.

09:50.551 --> 09:52.896
That's a full movie script
right there.

09:52.896 --> 09:55.517
Jorgeous gets to assign
the roles,

09:55.517 --> 10:00.172
and my first thought is,
oh, shit, here we go.

10:00.172 --> 10:03.172
Okay, well, I just
wanna first off say,

10:03.172 --> 10:06.172
like, I don't want y'all
to, like--

10:06.172 --> 10:08.137
I don't wanna give y'all,
like, a fucked-up part,

10:08.137 --> 10:09.862
so, like, whatever part
that y'all want,

10:09.862 --> 10:11.413
like, we'll talk about it,

10:11.413 --> 10:13.310
and if y'all have the same,
like, parts that y'all want,

10:13.310 --> 10:16.034
then we'll go from there.

10:16.034 --> 10:17.862
Because if y'all fail,
that's gonna be on y'all.

10:17.862 --> 10:19.448
It's not gonna be on me, bitch.

10:19.448 --> 10:21.275
Just saying.

10:21.275 --> 10:22.827
Like, that's the part
she wanted, bitch, so...

10:22.827 --> 10:25.103
I think that Jorgeous
handling it this way

10:25.103 --> 10:27.000
is the best political decision
she can make.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.413
And ultimately, she's going
to still get who she wants,

10:30.413 --> 10:32.103
which is the whole
important part.

10:32.103 --> 10:35.000
I feel like we should, like,
read through it a little bit.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.620
First off, we're going to
figure out what the roles are

10:37.620 --> 10:39.517
and how many lines they have.

10:39.517 --> 10:40.551
Oh, my God.

10:40.551 --> 10:41.862
I know.
It's a lot of words.

10:41.862 --> 10:43.379
This is a lot of shit.

10:43.379 --> 10:46.275
I think the strongest roles
are gonna be the mothers,

10:46.275 --> 10:49.206
but they also
have the most lines.

10:49.206 --> 10:52.137
So the really small, little
roles with a few little words

10:52.137 --> 10:53.482
are a potential win,

10:53.482 --> 10:55.551
because you can do
something crazy with them,

10:55.551 --> 10:57.448
and possibly
get a really big payout.

10:57.448 --> 11:00.379
Anybody have any ideas
on what they wanna do?

11:00.379 --> 11:02.448
I'd like
Hattie Ruth O'Hara's spot.

11:02.448 --> 11:03.620
Hattie Ruth.

11:03.620 --> 11:05.000
The meddlesome
sister/town gossip.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.103
I talk a lot.

11:06.103 --> 11:08.137
I really wanna be
Sierra Michaels,

11:08.137 --> 11:09.448
the sweet girl from
the other side of the tracks.

11:09.448 --> 11:12.448
I know I'm
the oldest bitch, but--

11:12.448 --> 11:13.931
That's who I wanted to be, too.

11:13.931 --> 11:16.724
Oh, really? Well, then obviously
I'm not getting Sierra.

11:16.724 --> 11:18.275
-Okay, great.
-Okay.

11:18.275 --> 11:19.793
Jorgeous is like,
"Whatever you want, take it.

11:19.793 --> 11:20.965
Just not Sierra, bitch."

11:20.965 --> 11:22.896
Okay, bitch? Legit.

11:22.896 --> 11:26.931
Moving on, I wanted Sierra,
but I'm down for Maggie.

11:26.931 --> 11:28.137
Maggie?

11:28.137 --> 11:29.241
Can I put down for Fancy,
Jorgeous?

11:29.241 --> 11:31.655
-Fancy?
-A glamorous older woman.

11:31.655 --> 11:32.758
That speaks to me.

11:32.758 --> 11:34.724
I think I'd like to do Deandra.

11:34.724 --> 11:37.344
I personally am very fixated
on the bride,

11:37.344 --> 11:40.413
the daughter of
the richest girl in Daytona.

11:40.413 --> 11:43.034
Bitch, that's very you.
That's very you, bitch.

11:43.034 --> 11:45.275
Willow, I don't know
what stands out to you, bitch,

11:45.275 --> 11:46.862
but you kind of give me, like,

11:46.862 --> 11:48.275
one of the Spring Break sisters.

11:48.275 --> 11:50.068
I think it would be funny

11:50.068 --> 11:53.344
if one of the Spring Break girls
was short and, like, little,

11:53.344 --> 11:56.448
and then the other
was huge and tall.

11:56.448 --> 11:59.551
-So you two?
-I'm slow at reading, I'm like--

11:59.551 --> 12:01.862
Fuck. Like,
everyone around me

12:01.862 --> 12:04.206
is just, like, yes, I want
this role, I want that role.

12:04.206 --> 12:06.379
Oh, this is so you, girl.
Oh, my God, this is me.

12:06.379 --> 12:07.689
And I'm like, what?

12:07.689 --> 12:10.689
I'm not even past page one.
Fucking hell.

12:10.689 --> 12:12.103
So does everybody have lines?

12:12.103 --> 12:13.931
-Not Camden.
-Not Camden.

12:13.931 --> 12:15.724
What's the last role
for Camden, then?

12:15.724 --> 12:17.793
It would have to be Leona.

12:17.793 --> 12:19.275
So are you cool with Leona...

12:19.275 --> 12:22.068
-Um...
-Lady Camden?

12:22.068 --> 12:24.344
I'm down with Leona.

12:24.344 --> 12:27.379
The scene, like, the only one
I've read, I'm like, okay.

12:27.379 --> 12:28.482
Okay, I'll take Leona.

12:28.482 --> 12:29.931
Fuck, I hope
it's a good role.

12:29.931 --> 12:31.517
Yay. So we got it all together.

12:31.517 --> 12:32.724
-Yes!
-That was easy.

12:32.724 --> 12:34.310
Is everybody happy
with their roles?

12:34.310 --> 12:35.689
-Yes.
-Yes.

12:35.689 --> 12:37.206
Hopefully someone's
looking out for me

12:37.206 --> 12:38.275
up there in the universe,

12:38.275 --> 12:39.793
because I have no idea

12:39.793 --> 12:42.620
what I'm about
to start portraying.

12:42.620 --> 12:44.931
Lady Camden, we get to kiss!

12:44.931 --> 12:47.379
-Oh, yes!
-That's a dream came true!

12:51.655 --> 12:52.965
Tune in next time

12:52.965 --> 12:55.862
for more rip-roaring drama
on Daytona Wind.

12:55.862 --> 12:57.689
-Yes!
-Whoo!

12:57.689 --> 12:59.793
I'm really excited
about this challenge,

12:59.793 --> 13:01.103
because I love any opportunity

13:01.103 --> 13:03.931
to just get to showcase
some wacky character,

13:03.931 --> 13:06.620
and I've definitely been
itching for another win.

13:06.620 --> 13:08.586
I'm ready to take
my rightful place

13:08.586 --> 13:11.310
on the throne again.

13:11.310 --> 13:13.310
-I love these roles.
-These are cute.

13:13.310 --> 13:17.034
Should we be stereotypical
blonde bimbo, or--

13:17.034 --> 13:19.275
I think I'm definitely
gonna go blonde.

13:19.275 --> 13:21.793
They said it's, like,
Spring Breaky girls.

13:21.793 --> 13:23.344
Okay.

13:23.344 --> 13:28.034
Once again, this challenge,
my goal is to not be safe.

13:28.034 --> 13:32.206
At this point, I just need the
judges to freaking notice me.

13:32.206 --> 13:34.241
-Mama Michaels?
-Mama Michaels?

13:34.241 --> 13:35.517
Okay, we need to play that up.

13:35.517 --> 13:37.241
Yeah, I think we should
synchronize, like...

13:37.241 --> 13:40.413
-Mama Michaels?
-Mama Michaels?

13:40.413 --> 13:43.482
One of us could go up
and one of us could go down.

13:43.482 --> 13:46.275
-Like Mama Michaels?
-Mama Michaels?

13:47.655 --> 13:50.241
Willow and Daya
are playing sisters.

13:50.241 --> 13:51.517
They're having a lot of fun

13:51.517 --> 13:53.172
working out, like,
the different voices.

13:53.172 --> 13:56.482
My character
is only in one scene.

13:56.482 --> 13:57.655
Am I the mama or the grandma?

13:57.655 --> 13:58.862
I think I'm the grandma.

13:58.862 --> 14:00.724
You're not a grandma,
you're just old.

14:02.103 --> 14:03.931
I immediately see
that the role is written

14:03.931 --> 14:06.000
as, like,
a Joan Collins character,

14:06.000 --> 14:09.103
as told by Fancy,
as sung by Reba.

14:09.103 --> 14:10.724
I feel really confident
in this role,

14:10.724 --> 14:13.241
because I know how this
character needs to be played.

14:13.241 --> 14:15.793
My character's obviously based
on, like, Fancy from Reba,

14:15.793 --> 14:18.137
so I'm giving myself,
like, the Reba lip.

14:18.137 --> 14:20.172
I have, like, no upper lip on.

14:20.172 --> 14:22.137
I wanna see if I can find
a Reba wig somewhere in here.

14:24.655 --> 14:26.965
Forget it. I don't want
your sloppy seconds!

14:26.965 --> 14:28.793
-Hush yourself, little girl!
-Oh!

14:28.793 --> 14:31.103
There will be a wedding today.

14:31.103 --> 14:33.379
My group is feeling the fantasy.

14:33.379 --> 14:35.448
We're embodying the characters.

14:35.448 --> 14:39.103
A loose woman like you
in love with an O'Hara?

14:40.793 --> 14:42.172
Being dramatic and crazy,

14:42.172 --> 14:44.241
and, like, what happened?
Who did that? Why?

14:44.241 --> 14:46.827
Should we try, just try,

14:46.827 --> 14:48.310
to do it without reading
our scripts?

14:48.310 --> 14:49.793
-Yes. Absolutely.
-Or no?

14:49.793 --> 14:53.172
There she is,
the blushing bride Deandra.

14:53.172 --> 14:55.482
Just smell the magnolias.

14:55.482 --> 14:57.034
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

14:58.310 --> 15:00.448
I forgot the last part.

15:00.448 --> 15:02.137
"And get a load of that."

15:02.137 --> 15:04.413
And get a no--

15:04.413 --> 15:06.655
And get a--
oh, fucking shit.

15:06.655 --> 15:09.275
Load. That's the word.

15:09.275 --> 15:11.586
The biggest concern I have
for this challenge

15:11.586 --> 15:13.448
is memorizing these lines.

15:13.448 --> 15:16.344
I have a big load.

15:19.827 --> 15:23.068
Now listen here,
and listen good.

15:23.068 --> 15:25.689
The O'Haras
and the Davenports--sorry.

15:25.689 --> 15:28.241
The Davenports and the O'Haras
have had this wedding--

15:28.241 --> 15:29.551
Oh, motherfucker.

15:29.551 --> 15:31.206
Have been planning this wedding.

15:31.206 --> 15:33.103
Yes. The Davenports
and the O'Haras

15:33.103 --> 15:34.655
have been planning this wedding

15:34.655 --> 15:37.620
since you two were knee-high,
bigger than a spark plug.

15:37.620 --> 15:38.758
Is it bigger?

15:38.758 --> 15:40.275
It's "knee-high
to a spark plug."

15:40.275 --> 15:42.793
I have a lot of lines,

15:42.793 --> 15:45.965
and my brain, especially
in a stressful environment,

15:45.965 --> 15:48.034
just kind of goes 50,000
different directions.

15:48.034 --> 15:50.758
I have something to say.

15:52.448 --> 15:54.586
She had all of our lines.

15:54.586 --> 15:56.241
She knows our lines
better than we do.

15:56.241 --> 15:59.206
I may be loose
and I may be a woman,

15:59.206 --> 16:01.965
but I love
Dieso O'Hara--Diesel.

16:03.241 --> 16:05.241
I need to bring it
this acting challenge,

16:05.241 --> 16:08.034
because, girl, the last two
acting challenges

16:08.034 --> 16:11.448
where we had to speak,
bitch, I was awful.

16:11.448 --> 16:13.517
I just came from a win,

16:13.517 --> 16:15.413
and, bitch, if I'm in the bottom
this week,

16:15.413 --> 16:16.827
I'm gonna be devastated.

16:18.551 --> 16:19.965
Coming up...

16:19.965 --> 16:23.103
This is the Joan Collins school
of acting, darling.

16:23.103 --> 16:25.000
Maxine!

16:26.241 --> 16:28.931
-Pee-yew!

16:28.931 --> 16:32.137
You know what they say.

16:32.137 --> 16:33.344
Oh. What'd they say?

16:34.551 --> 16:36.517
I'm doing this in this moment.

16:46.172 --> 16:51.862
It is time to shoot
The Daytona Windwith RuPaul.

16:51.862 --> 16:53.275
I'm freaking out right now,

16:53.275 --> 16:55.689
because Michelle and Carson
is one thing, baby,

16:55.689 --> 16:57.931
but RuPaul is an entirely
different ballgame.

16:58.931 --> 17:02.103
-Hi, ladies.
-Hello!

17:02.103 --> 17:04.000
How many of you
know who Joan Collins is?

17:04.000 --> 17:05.172
Yes!

17:05.172 --> 17:09.000
Okay, well, Joan Collins
has taught us

17:09.000 --> 17:12.310
that acting
isn't about feelings.

17:12.310 --> 17:16.482
Acting is all about
your camera angle.

17:17.758 --> 17:19.137
Those people out there,

17:19.137 --> 17:22.758
those people in the dark,
watching you,

17:22.758 --> 17:25.068
maybe with a fistful of lotion.

17:26.862 --> 17:28.137
That's what we are doing.

17:28.137 --> 17:30.448
Are you ready
to do some acting?

17:30.448 --> 17:32.034
-Yes.
-Yes.

17:32.034 --> 17:34.758
So the first scene
is the Davenports,

17:34.758 --> 17:37.724
and the other ones can sit down.
Places, everybody.

17:37.724 --> 17:41.482
And you other girls, please
listen to all this direction.

17:41.482 --> 17:45.551
So my, Kerri, and Jorgeous'
group are up first.

17:45.551 --> 17:46.655
That's an extreme amount
of pressure.

17:46.655 --> 17:47.862
Everyone else behind us

17:47.862 --> 17:50.000
can just learn
from our mistakes,

17:50.000 --> 17:51.137
so that's an advantage.

17:51.137 --> 17:53.413
Going first?
Not an advantage.

17:53.413 --> 17:58.379
Now, take your time
and have fun. Action!

17:58.379 --> 18:01.586
What a gorgeous day
for a wedding.

18:01.586 --> 18:04.620
Just smell the magnolias.

18:04.620 --> 18:07.517
Cut. Remember, it's Florida.

18:07.517 --> 18:10.000
It's hot, it's humid.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.413
I want you to give me

18:11.413 --> 18:14.103
the strongest Southern accent
you can muster up.

18:14.103 --> 18:16.517
I mean, pour it on.
A stupid pour-it-on.

18:16.517 --> 18:19.344
Can I hear a little bit
of your Southern accent?

18:19.344 --> 18:22.517
What a gorgeous day
for a wedding.

18:22.517 --> 18:24.931
You're from California,
aren't you?

18:24.931 --> 18:27.758
You're saying everything
with the same cadence.

18:27.758 --> 18:29.206
-Put some feeling into it.
-Okay.

18:29.206 --> 18:31.965
Take some air in, break up
some of those sentences.

18:31.965 --> 18:33.275
Okay.

18:33.275 --> 18:35.379
And action!

18:35.379 --> 18:40.551
The Davenports and the O'Haras
have been planning this wedding.

18:40.551 --> 18:43.103
There will be a wedding today.

18:43.103 --> 18:46.689
Bitch, all of a sudden you're
just back to speaking normal?

18:46.689 --> 18:48.103
What is going on?

18:48.103 --> 18:52.655
Even if I have to marry you.
Even if I...

18:52.655 --> 18:55.275
She's losing
her Southern accent.

18:55.275 --> 18:58.689
...have to marry you myself.

18:58.689 --> 19:00.586
All right, great.
So we're moving on.

19:00.586 --> 19:05.206
Oh, Mother, I just can't go
through with the wedding today.

19:05.206 --> 19:07.931
Drag it out more.
Say, "Oh, Mother Davenport."

19:07.931 --> 19:11.000
Take a deep breath,
let it out,

19:11.000 --> 19:12.206
and then say the next line.

19:12.206 --> 19:14.689
Those pauses are very important.

19:14.689 --> 19:16.551
Okay, here we go. Action.

19:16.551 --> 19:19.344
Oh, Mother Davenport...

19:19.344 --> 19:23.551
I just can't go through
with the...wedding today.

19:23.551 --> 19:25.482
I love it!

19:26.862 --> 19:27.896
-Girls, did you see that?
-Yes.

19:27.896 --> 19:29.482
That's what you're doing.

19:29.482 --> 19:31.068
Let's move on to Jorgeous.

19:31.068 --> 19:32.344
Coming through that door

19:32.344 --> 19:35.068
is a perfect opportunity
to make an entrance.

19:35.068 --> 19:37.275
Can we get some soap opera
looks, the...

19:41.275 --> 19:44.551
This is the Joan Collins
school of acting, darling.

19:44.551 --> 19:46.655
-Okay, I got you.
-Yeah.

19:46.655 --> 19:48.482
Oh, shit.

19:48.482 --> 19:50.379
Uh-oh. Action.

19:50.379 --> 19:56.137
I will not be silenced.

19:56.137 --> 19:58.448
Pose.

19:58.448 --> 20:00.862
Drama.

20:00.862 --> 20:02.931
More drama!

20:04.517 --> 20:06.310
The telenovelas
that my mom be watching,

20:06.310 --> 20:09.827
girl, they're super dramatic,
and they're, like, ee, ee, ee!

20:09.827 --> 20:12.172
So I'm just trying to sell it
as much as I can.

20:12.172 --> 20:15.172
Where is my car?

20:15.172 --> 20:16.517
Did I leave the oven on?

20:16.517 --> 20:18.793
I feel like I'm doing good.

20:18.793 --> 20:20.758
I feel like I'm doing better
than the other girls.

20:20.758 --> 20:22.137
I'm not gonna lie.

20:22.137 --> 20:23.206
Where is my purse?

20:25.137 --> 20:26.172
Wait. This isn't my purse.

20:26.172 --> 20:28.862
Did I steal someone's purse?

20:30.862 --> 20:32.482
All right, cut.

20:32.482 --> 20:33.724
Oh, you just never know,

20:33.724 --> 20:35.827
because I could be
feeling good right now,

20:35.827 --> 20:36.827
but then when we see it,

20:36.827 --> 20:38.034
I'm like, oh, shit,

20:38.034 --> 20:40.068
I was the booger of the group.

20:40.068 --> 20:42.103
All right, next set of girls.

20:42.103 --> 20:44.620
I am dying
at Jasmine's outfit.

20:44.620 --> 20:47.379
She looks like the spitting
image of Alyssa Edwards,

20:47.379 --> 20:48.793
so it's just glorious.

20:50.241 --> 20:52.206
Maxine!

20:52.206 --> 20:54.586
Hattie Ruth, it's almost time
for the wedding.

20:54.586 --> 20:56.724
What took you so long?

20:56.724 --> 20:58.551
You're not gonna
wanna hear this.

20:58.551 --> 21:03.034
I heard that your son
Diesel O'Hara

21:03.034 --> 21:06.517
was seen necking
with that Michaels girl.

21:06.517 --> 21:08.241
Cut. Read that to me.

21:08.241 --> 21:10.344
You're not gonna
wanna hear this.

21:10.344 --> 21:11.931
Or should I do--

21:11.931 --> 21:13.827
Well, just try
some different things.

21:13.827 --> 21:16.931
Okay. You're not
gonna wanna hear this.

21:16.931 --> 21:18.413
You've got some juicy gossip.

21:18.413 --> 21:19.931
Feel it a different way.

21:19.931 --> 21:21.206
Do you do a Southern accent
at all?

21:21.206 --> 21:23.206
-I can if you want.
-Let me hear it.

21:23.206 --> 21:25.448
You're not gonna
wanna hear this.

21:25.448 --> 21:26.620
I love it already.

21:26.620 --> 21:31.103
Maxine...
I'm about to burst.

21:31.103 --> 21:33.172
What's wrong?

21:33.172 --> 21:34.758
I heard about your son,

21:34.758 --> 21:38.551
who's about to get married
in this very room,

21:38.551 --> 21:42.620
was seen necking
at the racetrack

21:42.620 --> 21:44.551
with that Michaels girl.

21:44.551 --> 21:49.827
The Michaels
are nothing but trash.

21:49.827 --> 21:51.413
Pee-yew!

21:51.413 --> 21:54.000
Cut. You are just ridiculous.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.689
Thank you!

21:55.689 --> 21:58.896
Jasmine is so funny.

21:58.896 --> 22:02.068
This is O'Hara's property.

22:05.103 --> 22:07.103
I can't believe my ears!

22:08.551 --> 22:11.896
Lightning has struck
in the most unlikely of places.

22:11.896 --> 22:16.551
Jasmine is somehow
so fucking terrible at acting

22:16.551 --> 22:18.689
that it has turned itself around

22:18.689 --> 22:22.344
and become my favorite thing
I have ever seen.

22:23.793 --> 22:26.586
Cut. All right, moving on.

22:26.586 --> 22:30.758
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

22:30.758 --> 22:34.517
I guess our invites
got lost in the email.

22:34.517 --> 22:40.172
The Michaels have been silent
for way too long.

22:40.172 --> 22:45.068
Our little sister is in love
with Diesel O'Hara.

22:45.068 --> 22:46.586
I love these Michaels girls.

22:46.586 --> 22:48.275
Yes!

22:48.275 --> 22:49.965
Y'all are really stupid.

22:51.344 --> 22:53.724
You know, Willow,
Daytime Emmy.

22:56.793 --> 22:58.275
Bitch, it's on.

22:58.275 --> 22:59.793
I want this win

22:59.793 --> 23:03.931
if not just as much as you,
probably more than you do.

23:03.931 --> 23:08.413
Listen up,
you hoity-toity Davenports,

23:08.413 --> 23:13.413
because we have
something to say.

23:13.413 --> 23:16.827
Nice, Daya.
Love that voice, Fantastic.

23:16.827 --> 23:17.931
Thank you.

23:17.931 --> 23:20.620
-Very, very trashy.
-Thanks.

23:20.620 --> 23:23.034
I hope Daya
breaks her safe streak,

23:23.034 --> 23:24.620
but if one if the sisters
is gonna be in the top,

23:24.620 --> 23:26.620
I want it to be me, obviously.

23:26.620 --> 23:27.827
Moving on.

23:35.379 --> 23:38.344
Bosco really does
look like Reba,

23:38.344 --> 23:41.344
and I'm, like,
oh, shit, Reba, hey!

23:41.344 --> 23:43.862
I'm here to clear the air.

23:43.862 --> 23:45.275
Cut.

23:45.275 --> 23:47.448
So leave the hat on.
It's a Dynastything.

23:47.448 --> 23:48.896
You leave the hat,

23:48.896 --> 23:52.275
and then you slowly lift up
to reveal who you are,

23:52.275 --> 23:54.586
-because it's a big...
-Okay.

23:56.482 --> 24:00.551
I'm here to clear the air.

24:00.551 --> 24:02.586
This wedding can't go on

24:02.586 --> 24:08.310
because Deandra Davenport
and Diesel O'Hara are...

24:08.310 --> 24:09.620
Brother...

24:09.620 --> 24:12.068
And sister!

24:12.068 --> 24:13.793
I know!

24:13.793 --> 24:15.482
That is what I just told them.

24:17.344 --> 24:19.137
That's great. Cut.

24:19.137 --> 24:22.827
Maxine!

24:22.827 --> 24:26.931
What brings you
on this side of the track?

24:26.931 --> 24:29.931
I think you know, Maxine.

24:29.931 --> 24:33.034
Don't let history
repeat itself.

24:33.034 --> 24:37.551
Don't stand in the way
of true love.

24:37.551 --> 24:39.448
Not again.

24:39.448 --> 24:42.344
And cut.
Very good, Lady Camden.

24:42.344 --> 24:43.931
-You think? You think?
-Yes.

24:43.931 --> 24:45.551
I was gonna keep going.

24:45.551 --> 24:46.896
You were very captivating
in that scene.

24:46.896 --> 24:48.275
Okay, great!

24:48.275 --> 24:51.172
Fucking hell, Ru just said
that I was captivating!

24:51.172 --> 24:53.068
I'm gonna remember that
forever.

24:53.068 --> 24:54.275
Action.

24:54.275 --> 24:57.103
Don't stand in the way
of true love.

24:57.103 --> 25:00.137
You know what they say.

25:02.275 --> 25:05.206
You know what they say.

25:05.206 --> 25:07.620
Oh, what'd they say?

25:07.620 --> 25:10.206
Camden is doing
a really, really good job,

25:10.206 --> 25:13.241
and I'm kind of
feeling, like, okay, girl,

25:13.241 --> 25:17.172
like, I hope I'm looking just
as good as she is in this scene.

25:17.172 --> 25:18.310
Not again.

25:21.206 --> 25:22.275
Shit.

25:23.689 --> 25:25.241
I'm in the scene with this ho,

25:25.241 --> 25:27.482
so I'm, like, girl,
I got something to live up to.

25:27.482 --> 25:28.931
I am shaking in my boots
right now.

25:28.931 --> 25:31.310
Angeria, feel the words.

25:31.310 --> 25:33.344
Lots of different
emotions, lots.

25:33.344 --> 25:34.827
Got it.

25:34.827 --> 25:38.689
Maxine O'Hara,
do you hear that?

25:38.689 --> 25:40.310
That's my heart beating.

25:42.172 --> 25:43.827
Leona, stop!

25:46.000 --> 25:48.482
I'm doing this in this moment.

25:48.482 --> 25:50.655
And cut.

25:50.655 --> 25:52.551
All right, ladies,
I think we got it.

25:52.551 --> 25:53.965
Thank you so much.

25:53.965 --> 25:56.758
Give yourselves
a big round of applause.

25:58.586 --> 26:02.586
Maybe it's not as bad as
I'm thinking it is right now.

26:02.586 --> 26:05.103
Maybe I'm honestly
just getting in my head.

26:05.103 --> 26:11.896
But I think Angie
is having her first off week.

26:13.275 --> 26:14.413
Coming up...

26:14.413 --> 26:17.655
So have you forgiven me yet?

26:17.655 --> 26:20.206
Because you know
we are here to fucking win.

26:20.206 --> 26:22.379
What happens if Jorgeous
is in the top

26:22.379 --> 26:23.655
and you're safe this week?

26:23.655 --> 26:26.620
-Oh!
-Oh!

26:35.103 --> 26:37.000
It's time to paint the face.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.482
Ooh!

26:38.482 --> 26:41.000
Today on the runway,
it's our first opportunity

26:41.000 --> 26:44.724
to see how the video Daytona
Windactually turned out.

26:44.724 --> 26:46.586
I'm so excited.

26:46.586 --> 26:51.241
Glue my brows, do my face,
da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da.

26:51.241 --> 26:52.517
I'm excited
to see what happens.

26:52.517 --> 26:54.862
Honestly, I just excited
to see the playback.

26:54.862 --> 26:56.137
Well, I'm a little scared.

26:56.137 --> 26:58.517
I don't feel the best
right now.

26:58.517 --> 27:00.827
I could see it
in your face yesterday.

27:00.827 --> 27:01.931
You were feeling a little...

27:01.931 --> 27:04.655
You were very quiet
yesterday.

27:04.655 --> 27:06.482
Yeah, and, bitch, you know
I ain't never quiet.

27:06.482 --> 27:08.413
That's why it was shocking,

27:08.413 --> 27:09.620
because that was the first time
I've seen you quiet.

27:09.620 --> 27:14.103
Yeah. It was just
a lot of emotions.

27:14.103 --> 27:17.034
Angeria has been doing so well,

27:17.034 --> 27:19.689
and I think she just
needs to make sure

27:19.689 --> 27:21.689
that she doesn't crack
under the pressure.

27:21.689 --> 27:25.172
I think the thing that Angie
struggles with the most

27:25.172 --> 27:28.689
is just always thinking
about the worst case scenario.

27:28.689 --> 27:31.827
I don't know if she always knows
how freaking special she is.

27:32.965 --> 27:36.724
So have you forgiven me yet?

27:36.724 --> 27:39.758
Because you know
I'm obsessed with you,

27:39.758 --> 27:42.482
but at the same time,
we are here--

27:42.482 --> 27:44.448
-For a competition.
-To fucking win.

27:44.448 --> 27:45.758
Yes!

27:45.758 --> 27:48.068
And especially because
I have been safe.

27:48.068 --> 27:49.724
-Yeah.
-And which is fine,

27:49.724 --> 27:52.103
because I'm not complaining
about still being safe,

27:52.103 --> 27:53.896
but kinda.

27:53.896 --> 27:55.793
-Right.
-But you know what I'm saying?

27:55.793 --> 27:57.655
It's just more
of my competitiveness

27:57.655 --> 27:59.724
than not wanting
my friend to succeed.

27:59.724 --> 28:00.724
Absolutely.

28:00.724 --> 28:02.103
You know what I'm saying?

28:02.103 --> 28:03.344
I have to say, being in
a competition setting

28:03.344 --> 28:04.586
doesn't necessarily bring out

28:04.586 --> 28:06.275
the best parts
of my personality.

28:06.275 --> 28:08.724
-Oh, yeah.
-Like, so I get that.

28:08.724 --> 28:10.413
What happens if Jorgeous
is in the top

28:10.413 --> 28:11.862
and you're safe this week?

28:11.862 --> 28:15.413
I'm not gonna
sit on anything.

28:15.413 --> 28:17.310
That is not
what I heard about you.

28:21.034 --> 28:24.724
The theme of this week's
runway is Chaps.

28:24.724 --> 28:28.965
Ladies, how are we feeling about
this night's runway, Chaps?

28:28.965 --> 28:31.103
-Whoo, whoo, whoo!
-Chappy-chaps!

28:31.103 --> 28:33.344
-Chaps is such a fun category.
-It really is.

28:33.344 --> 28:34.586
It's a drag quintessential.

28:34.586 --> 28:36.000
When, like,
my brain thinks of chaps,

28:36.000 --> 28:37.931
I'm thinking,
like, leather daddy.

28:37.931 --> 28:40.758
I'm thinking, like, kind of
leather fetish elements.

28:40.758 --> 28:42.344
Does anybody, like,
have any background

28:42.344 --> 28:44.103
with, like,
the leather community?

28:44.103 --> 28:45.448
I mean, in San Francisco,

28:45.448 --> 28:47.206
it's basically, like,
you know, the uniform.

28:47.206 --> 28:49.517
Well, because Folsom's
right there.

28:49.517 --> 28:51.413
Have you ever been to Folsom,
Miss Camden?

28:51.413 --> 28:53.551
-Oh, yes, honey.
-Yeah? Tell me about that.

28:53.551 --> 28:55.689
Well, I just like to go
and just observe,

28:55.689 --> 28:56.862
window-shop here and there.

28:56.862 --> 28:58.103
Yes!

28:58.103 --> 29:00.172
The Folsom Street Fair

29:00.172 --> 29:03.586
is a notorious,
infamous kink festival.

29:03.586 --> 29:08.034
Folsom is not the
corporate sponsored Pride parade

29:08.034 --> 29:09.655
that you may see on TV.

29:09.655 --> 29:13.862
It's a crazy fever dream
of bears, cubs,

29:13.862 --> 29:20.103
and any other gay subspecies,
and anything goes.

29:20.103 --> 29:21.931
People might kind of be off-put,
showing up to an event

29:21.931 --> 29:24.379
and everyone's just, like, in
a thong and chaps kind of thing.

29:24.379 --> 29:26.827
I feel like it's something that
we don't even bat an eye at.

29:26.827 --> 29:28.448
Yeah, we don't even
think about it.

29:28.448 --> 29:30.482
Of course there's some dude
dressed up as a dog.

29:32.172 --> 29:34.413
Folsom Street Fair
is an opportunity

29:34.413 --> 29:36.827
for people to go
and explore their sexuality,

29:36.827 --> 29:38.068
explore who they are,

29:38.068 --> 29:40.620
be part of the community
without judgment.

29:40.620 --> 29:42.689
A lot of things like that
in San Francisco

29:42.689 --> 29:44.103
are just considered sacred,

29:44.103 --> 29:45.586
because there's not
a lot of space

29:45.586 --> 29:48.586
for people to kind of express
who they are sexually.

29:48.586 --> 29:51.310
It's better to be open about it
and not be scared of sex.

29:51.310 --> 29:53.793
So wait. I've never heard
of this fair.

29:53.793 --> 29:55.413
What's happening at the fair?

29:55.413 --> 29:59.413
At Folsom there's literally
people, like, having full-on--

29:59.413 --> 30:00.551
Sex.

30:00.551 --> 30:02.310
-At the fair?
-Yeah.

30:02.310 --> 30:04.344
Bitch, I wanna go to the fair!

30:06.482 --> 30:09.068
There is always a family
friendly version of Pride,

30:09.068 --> 30:10.482
but I don't necessarily think

30:10.482 --> 30:14.000
that every gay space
needs to be family-friendly.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.551
There's some grit there,

30:15.551 --> 30:17.241
and there needs to be space
for that grit to stay there.

30:19.793 --> 30:22.000
I really already miss Maddy.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.931
I know, I know.

30:23.931 --> 30:26.379
Did y'all kiss and make up
before she, like--

30:26.379 --> 30:28.551
He actually wrote me
a really sweet note.

30:28.551 --> 30:29.551
Let me read it out for y'all.

30:29.551 --> 30:31.758
"I ain't mad at ya.

30:31.758 --> 30:34.000
"You did what you had to do.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.551
"Also, I expect you

30:35.551 --> 30:38.517
to show a little country girl
around the Big Apple."

30:38.517 --> 30:39.793
-Aw!
-Aw!

30:39.793 --> 30:41.379
You'll be able
to talk to her next week,

30:41.379 --> 30:42.689
when you get sent home.

30:42.689 --> 30:45.172
-Oh!
-Oh!

30:45.172 --> 30:48.137
-Someone's very confident.

30:48.137 --> 30:49.551
That's how you've been
all the other weeks,

30:49.551 --> 30:51.137
and look
where it's gotten you.

30:51.137 --> 30:52.137
-Oh!
-Oh!

30:52.137 --> 30:53.758
Bitch, I've been safe.

30:53.758 --> 30:55.172
You're the one that's been in
the bottom the past two weeks.

30:55.172 --> 30:57.655
Right, but I don't get compared
to my drag mother.

30:57.655 --> 30:59.275
-Oh!

30:59.275 --> 31:01.862
Yes, she gets right up
in there, girl!

31:01.862 --> 31:03.517
Listen, if you ain't
reading your friend,

31:03.517 --> 31:05.068
it's not your true friend, okay?

31:05.068 --> 31:06.206
Period.

31:29.448 --> 31:32.482
Yeow.

31:32.482 --> 31:35.103
Welcome to the main stage
of RuPaul's Drag Race.

31:35.103 --> 31:36.758
Michelle Visage.

31:36.758 --> 31:39.206
Now, if you could create
your own soap opera,

31:39.206 --> 31:40.827
what would it be called?

31:40.827 --> 31:43.586
Well, it used to be called
Santa Boobara,

31:43.586 --> 31:47.379
but now it's The Young
and the Breastless.

31:47.379 --> 31:48.896
Wait. Did you say "young?"

31:48.896 --> 31:50.517
Ooh!

31:50.517 --> 31:52.862
You bitch!

31:52.862 --> 31:55.103
The hilarious Ross Mathews.

31:55.103 --> 31:57.241
What would your soap opera
be called?

31:57.241 --> 31:59.275
Well, of course it'd be
General Ross-pital,

31:59.275 --> 32:02.172
but only because Gays
of Our Liveswas too obvious.

32:02.172 --> 32:04.137
Oh, yes, of course.

32:04.137 --> 32:07.931
And queen of all social media,
Ts Madison.

32:07.931 --> 32:10.068
Now, Maddy, what would
your soap opera be called?

32:10.068 --> 32:12.448
Well, you know, Ru, I don't
think it would be a soap opera.

32:12.448 --> 32:13.827
I think it'd be
a soap opera sitcom.

32:13.827 --> 32:14.896
Oh!

32:14.896 --> 32:17.344
I Dream of Weenie.

32:19.241 --> 32:21.275
I'm gonna give you
the green light.

32:23.137 --> 32:24.793
This week
we challenged our queens

32:24.793 --> 32:29.379
to serve drama in the juicy new
soap opera The Daytona Wind.

32:29.379 --> 32:30.862
-Ooh.
-And tonight,

32:30.862 --> 32:34.206
category is
Chaps On The Runway.

32:35.241 --> 32:37.517
Racers, start your engines,

32:37.517 --> 32:39.689
and may the best drag queen win.

32:39.689 --> 32:41.965
Coming up...

32:41.965 --> 32:43.758
That's how you shock us
on a runway.

32:43.758 --> 32:46.517
This look, it is gor-geous.

32:46.517 --> 32:47.724
I want that right there, honey.

32:47.724 --> 32:49.551
Give it to me in a 4X.

33:00.896 --> 33:05.655
Category is
Chaps On The Runway?

33:05.655 --> 33:08.103
Up first, Willow Pill.

33:08.103 --> 33:10.793
Singlehandedly
bringing back the ponytail.

33:10.793 --> 33:13.620
Michelle:
Double-handedly.

33:13.620 --> 33:15.965
You gotta hand it to her.

33:15.965 --> 33:17.034
I've always wanted
to do this look

33:17.034 --> 33:19.448
that's basically, like,

33:19.448 --> 33:20.862
the world's biggest
atomic wedgie.

33:20.862 --> 33:25.551
It's all about sex
and silliness.

33:25.551 --> 33:28.068
Now, you must floss
twice a day.

33:28.068 --> 33:31.206
Walking in this
is not the most comfortable,

33:31.206 --> 33:34.379
but you know I'll do anything
to sell the whole fantasy.

33:34.379 --> 33:35.965
Now, Michelle,
is this what they mean

33:35.965 --> 33:37.931
by "double-fisting?"

33:37.931 --> 33:39.620
I hope so!

33:39.620 --> 33:41.241
Bosco.

33:41.241 --> 33:44.344
Michelle:
Pinky Tuscadero.

33:44.344 --> 33:48.241
I feel like just
this motorcycle hot bitch

33:48.241 --> 33:50.103
from the early 2000s.

33:50.103 --> 33:53.758
Very I just got kicked off
ofRock of Love

33:53.758 --> 33:57.517
for sleeping with one of
the best boys on episode two.

33:57.517 --> 34:00.206
Leather chaps, leather fringe,

34:00.206 --> 34:02.931
40-inch human blonde hair.

34:02.931 --> 34:04.551
You can't tell me shit.

34:04.551 --> 34:07.655
Wait, wait. No, you can't
tell me a goddamn thing.

34:07.655 --> 34:10.551
I look so hot.

34:10.551 --> 34:13.896
Isn't she a sight
for pink eyes?

34:15.034 --> 34:16.586
DeJa Skye.

34:16.586 --> 34:18.620
This is why all
the blue cheetahs are extinct.

34:20.689 --> 34:22.034
My goodness.

34:22.034 --> 34:24.379
Orange you glad
she wore that hair?

34:24.379 --> 34:26.413
My body-ody-ody is snatch.

34:26.413 --> 34:29.655
Ass out, legs wide,

34:29.655 --> 34:30.758
and the bottom--

34:30.758 --> 34:32.310
and I'm talking about me--

34:32.310 --> 34:33.758
moves beautifully.

34:33.758 --> 34:37.034
I am feeling every oats,
grains, wheats, thins.

34:37.034 --> 34:39.689
I am having a blast
on the runway.

34:39.689 --> 34:41.793
Ride a whore,
save a cowboy.

34:41.793 --> 34:43.655
Yes!

34:43.655 --> 34:45.172
Kerri Colby.

34:45.172 --> 34:47.000
Michelle:
Take that, Jane Child.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.517
She don't wanna
fall in love.

34:48.517 --> 34:49.551
Nope.

34:49.551 --> 34:51.310
RuPaul:
When Hairy met Hairier.

34:51.310 --> 34:52.862
Y'all already know

34:52.862 --> 34:54.965
I love me some inches
on my hair,

34:54.965 --> 34:57.206
and I got 90 of 'em today.

34:57.206 --> 34:59.931
Every ounce of hair
on this outfit

34:59.931 --> 35:02.103
is 100% human hair bundled.

35:02.103 --> 35:04.448
I hand-dyed
each of them myself, y'all,

35:04.448 --> 35:06.689
and I hope that y'all enjoy
every inch of me.

35:06.689 --> 35:09.862
Ooh, honey, you betta
Chewbacca that ass up.

35:12.137 --> 35:13.448
Jorgeous.

35:13.448 --> 35:14.689
This ain't her first time

35:14.689 --> 35:17.379
at the Frederick's
of Hollywood rodeo.

35:19.862 --> 35:21.103
I think the pants
should be a size up.

35:23.517 --> 35:26.379
My version of chaps
is very lacy, burlesquey.

35:26.379 --> 35:29.275
It looks like I didn't pull up
my pants all the way, girl.

35:29.275 --> 35:31.586
It's accentuating
my body so good.

35:31.586 --> 35:35.137
And, girl, I'm giving you
my tia's hair

35:35.137 --> 35:37.172
from back in the day,
how she used to style it,

35:37.172 --> 35:39.827
and I'm giving you ass,
titties.

35:39.827 --> 35:42.000
I'm giving you body.

35:42.000 --> 35:45.344
Ooh, she's got
a lace front and a lace back.

35:45.344 --> 35:49.344
Angeria Paris VanMicheals.

35:49.344 --> 35:51.655
-Ooh!
-Ooh!

35:51.655 --> 35:53.344
Ring them bell-bottoms!

35:53.344 --> 35:56.310
Come on, Darcel
from Solid Gold!

35:56.310 --> 35:57.965
Okay.

35:57.965 --> 36:01.862
I am giving you
a full, elevated disco fantasy.

36:01.862 --> 36:05.724
Baby, I am feeling like
I am in Studio 54 right now.

36:05.724 --> 36:07.310
Baby, I feel so lovely.

36:07.310 --> 36:09.655
I got my bone-straight hair on.

36:09.655 --> 36:11.517
I feel like Cher in the future.

36:11.517 --> 36:12.620
-You know who'd love this?
-Who?

36:12.620 --> 36:14.551
Jeffrey Bowyer-Chap-man.

36:17.724 --> 36:19.758
Jasmine Kennedie.

36:19.758 --> 36:21.793
I think she's schooling us.

36:21.793 --> 36:22.965
She gettin' that Ph-D!

36:24.620 --> 36:25.965
The concept
for my Chaps look

36:25.965 --> 36:29.068
is graduation girl
going down the runway,

36:29.068 --> 36:30.482
feeling fierce as can be.

36:30.482 --> 36:32.620
I am wearing
my high school colors.

36:32.620 --> 36:34.275
Shout out, Spartans.

36:34.275 --> 36:37.206
I'm giving something the judges
wouldn't expect from me,

36:37.206 --> 36:40.827
and I wanted to show them that,
hey, she's campy and she's fun.

36:40.827 --> 36:43.620
She graduated
with a BA: a big ass.

36:46.551 --> 36:48.448
Lady Camden.

36:48.448 --> 36:50.241
Mmm.

36:50.241 --> 36:51.896
-Ooh.
-Ooh!

36:51.896 --> 36:53.965
Oh! Uh-oh.

36:53.965 --> 36:55.586
-You okay?
-Oh, shoot.

36:55.586 --> 36:57.379
Face-first.

36:57.379 --> 36:59.379
This is every
drag queen's nightmare.

37:00.413 --> 37:02.689
Surprise!

37:02.689 --> 37:04.413
I'm Freddie Mercury, bitch!

37:04.413 --> 37:06.586
I could see Ru
in my peripheral vision.

37:06.586 --> 37:09.758
I know it's a home run, bitch.

37:09.758 --> 37:13.379
Oh, yes, honey,
we are the champions.

37:13.379 --> 37:16.137
I'm trying to just give you,
like, rock and roll,

37:16.137 --> 37:19.896
masculine, sexual beast,
you know?

37:19.896 --> 37:21.482
Which is not really me,

37:21.482 --> 37:23.758
but it's a very
liberating feeling.

37:23.758 --> 37:26.448
If you stay Freddie,
you ain't got to get Freddie.

37:28.206 --> 37:30.724
Crazy little thing
called drag.

37:30.724 --> 37:32.275
Bohemian Chap-sody.

37:32.275 --> 37:35.896
Yes.

37:35.896 --> 37:39.586
Up next, Daya Betty.

37:39.586 --> 37:41.034
She a working girl.

37:41.034 --> 37:43.413
Excuse me. Do you have
a businesswoman special?

37:43.413 --> 37:46.620
C-E-oh, no,
she betta don't!

37:46.620 --> 37:49.482
I want them to see
that I'm a sophisticated woman.

37:49.482 --> 37:50.896
She's a businesswoman

37:50.896 --> 37:52.551
with a little bit
of a dirty secret.

37:52.551 --> 37:54.379
I work really hard at work,

37:54.379 --> 37:57.172
but at night, I work
even harder when I get home.

37:57.172 --> 37:59.448
And, you know,
when you can show your ass

37:59.448 --> 38:02.517
and it looks that good,
why not do it?

38:02.517 --> 38:03.758
That's right, bitch.

38:03.758 --> 38:07.241
Business on top,
whore on the bottom.

38:07.241 --> 38:08.344
That's it.

38:10.379 --> 38:12.068
Coming up...

38:12.068 --> 38:13.586
Ladies.

38:13.586 --> 38:15.620
What the fuck is going on?

38:15.620 --> 38:19.793
My, how The Daytona Winds
have shifted.

38:19.793 --> 38:21.000
What the hell's this?

38:27.206 --> 38:29.000
Welcome, ladies.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.965
Last night
I was watching the dailies

38:31.965 --> 38:34.482
from The Daytona Wind,

38:34.482 --> 38:35.655
and something was missing.

38:37.206 --> 38:38.724
I couldn't put my finger on it,

38:38.724 --> 38:41.448
and then suddenly,
without warning,

38:41.448 --> 38:44.758
poof, there it was.

38:44.758 --> 38:47.689
So I'm excited to share with you

38:47.689 --> 38:53.655
the official director's cut
of The Daytona Wind.

38:55.344 --> 38:58.275
From mountains high
to valleys low,

38:58.275 --> 39:02.206
there's no escaping
The Daytona Wind.

39:08.000 --> 39:14.482
What a gorgeous day
for a wedding.

39:14.482 --> 39:18.172
Oh, Mama!

39:18.172 --> 39:20.275
There she is,

39:20.275 --> 39:23.172
the blushing bride Deandra.

39:23.172 --> 39:26.689
Just smell the magnolias!

39:30.965 --> 39:32.620
And the peonies.

39:36.758 --> 39:40.862
And get a load of that
night-bloomin' jasmine.

39:43.896 --> 39:45.758
What?

39:45.758 --> 39:48.827
I don't think I can go through
with the wedding today.

39:48.827 --> 39:51.655
Sounds like my baby girl
has butterflies in her stomach.

39:54.482 --> 39:56.068
Now, y'all know damn well
I did not fart.

39:56.068 --> 39:57.103
What the hell is this?

39:57.103 --> 39:59.310
Well, let it out.

39:59.310 --> 40:01.068
Here it goes.

40:04.482 --> 40:08.758
I saw my soon-to-be wedded
husband, Diesel O'Hara,

40:08.758 --> 40:10.896
with Sierra Michaels!

40:10.896 --> 40:14.241
They were lovin'
on each other, Mama!

40:14.241 --> 40:17.827
Now listen here,
and listen good.

40:22.206 --> 40:24.275
Daytona Winds.

40:24.275 --> 40:26.551
All of the jokes
are starting to make sense.

40:26.551 --> 40:30.379
I will not be silenced.

40:32.620 --> 40:33.793
I feel very stupid

40:33.793 --> 40:36.172
for not picking up on it
sooner.

40:36.172 --> 40:37.965
I have something to say,

40:37.965 --> 40:41.068
and I cannot hold it in
any longer.

40:44.206 --> 40:46.793
I love Diesel O'Hara.

40:46.793 --> 40:49.517
God, this is
so wonderfully stupid.

40:49.517 --> 40:51.206
A loose woman like you?

40:53.275 --> 40:55.034
Give us another Emmy, please.

40:55.034 --> 40:56.172
Hush yourself, little girl.

40:57.172 --> 40:59.379
There will be a wedding today,

40:59.379 --> 41:03.275
even if I have
to marry you myself.

41:04.758 --> 41:08.103
Will Deandra
Davenport marry Diesel?

41:08.103 --> 41:11.551
Will Sierra Michaels
pump the brakes on true love?

41:11.551 --> 41:15.551
And what's really eating
at Mother Maggie Davenport?

41:20.206 --> 41:22.344
Maxine!

41:22.344 --> 41:25.482
Hattie Ruth, it's almost time
for the wedding.

41:25.482 --> 41:27.482
What took you so long?

41:27.482 --> 41:29.482
I'm about to burst!

41:29.482 --> 41:30.758
What's wrong?

41:30.758 --> 41:33.482
You're not gonna
wanna hear this.

41:34.655 --> 41:38.137
I heard your son,
Diesel O'Hara,

41:38.137 --> 41:41.758
was seen necking
with that Michaels girl.

41:41.758 --> 41:43.758
Nobody can stop this wedding.

41:43.758 --> 41:48.655
I bet Leona Michaels
is behind all this.

41:48.655 --> 41:51.034
Leona Michaels
would never have the nerve

41:51.034 --> 41:53.172
to show her face around here.

41:55.793 --> 42:00.034
Maxine O'Hara,
as I live and breathe.

42:01.172 --> 42:03.551
Your son Diesel

42:03.551 --> 42:09.241
is in love
with my daughter Sierra.

42:09.241 --> 42:10.827
I may have heard
the rumblings...

42:13.241 --> 42:14.586
but I'm not surprised.

42:14.586 --> 42:17.206
The Michaels are known
to be rather...

42:18.862 --> 42:20.965
seductive.

42:20.965 --> 42:24.689
You can't stand in the way
of true love.

42:25.931 --> 42:27.103
Not again.

42:28.275 --> 42:30.103
Pee-yew!

42:31.448 --> 42:33.172
You shouldn't even be here!

42:33.172 --> 42:36.172
If you don't still love me,
tell me now!

42:36.172 --> 42:37.448
I'll...

42:40.482 --> 42:42.586
I'll tell you this.

42:42.586 --> 42:46.000
There will be a wedding today.

42:49.827 --> 42:52.655
That wasn't me.

42:52.655 --> 42:55.275
Will Maxine O'Hara
stop the wedding?

42:55.275 --> 42:59.172
Will Leona Michaels
go another lap for love?

42:59.172 --> 43:02.517
And will Hattie Ruth
ever run out of hot air?

43:05.000 --> 43:08.344
Now, if anybody in here
has any objections,

43:08.344 --> 43:11.620
speak now
or forever hold yo' peace.

43:13.965 --> 43:15.896
Ooh!

43:15.896 --> 43:18.034
Then by the powers vested in me,

43:18.034 --> 43:20.448
I now pronounce you
husband and--

43:20.448 --> 43:25.517
Hold up, hold up,
hold up.

43:25.517 --> 43:27.827
Now, wait a minute, bitch!

43:27.827 --> 43:32.103
I guess our invites
got lost in the email.

43:32.103 --> 43:36.379
Who would invite prostitutes
to a wedding?

43:36.379 --> 43:41.344
The Michaels have been silenced
for way too long.

43:41.344 --> 43:46.103
So listen up,
you hoity-toity Davenports!

43:48.344 --> 43:52.689
Because we have
something to say.

43:52.689 --> 43:55.827
Our little sister Sierra

43:55.827 --> 43:58.896
is in love with Diesel O'Hara,

43:58.896 --> 44:01.896
and he's in love with her.

44:02.896 --> 44:06.862
You all are just vile creatures.

44:08.896 --> 44:11.448
We know the awful truth

44:11.448 --> 44:16.310
behind all you
filthy Drag Racers.

44:16.310 --> 44:19.827
The only person who knows
our sordid family secrets

44:19.827 --> 44:21.655
left Daytona years ago.

44:27.586 --> 44:30.275
I'm here to clear the air.

44:33.379 --> 44:34.931
Who--who--who's that?

44:34.931 --> 44:38.034
That's Fancy, Fancy Michaels.

44:38.034 --> 44:40.724
Her mama put her
in a satin dancing dress

44:40.724 --> 44:41.724
the summer she turned 18.

44:41.724 --> 44:43.517
I'm here to spill the tea

44:43.517 --> 44:46.793
on all of you
Daytona hypocrites.

44:46.793 --> 44:48.965
I would think long and hard
before you make another peep.

44:50.275 --> 44:53.413
This land once belonged
to the Michaels clan,

44:53.413 --> 44:55.655
but then the Davenports
stole it.

44:55.655 --> 44:58.586
Well, I know
one thing for sure.

44:58.586 --> 45:00.275
This wedding can't go on

45:00.275 --> 45:06.551
because Deandra Davenport
and Diesel O'Hara are...

45:06.551 --> 45:08.379
Brother...

45:08.379 --> 45:10.448
And sister.

45:13.413 --> 45:17.689
Maxine!

45:17.689 --> 45:19.206
-Mama Michaels?
-Mama Michaels?

45:20.448 --> 45:22.517
I regret the day I let myself

45:22.517 --> 45:29.310
get talked out of being
with my one true lesbian love!

45:29.310 --> 45:33.931
Maxine O'Hara,
will you finally marry me?

45:37.241 --> 45:38.896
Do you hear that?

45:40.172 --> 45:41.448
I said there will be
a wedding today,

45:41.448 --> 45:45.448
and as God as my witness,
there will be.

45:45.448 --> 45:46.758
Is this thing on?

45:46.758 --> 45:48.793
Is this wedding on?

45:48.793 --> 45:50.620
'Cause if not,
I need to step out

45:50.620 --> 45:52.586
and get me some fresh air,
heffas.

45:52.586 --> 45:55.206
22 inches, bitch.

45:56.517 --> 45:57.896
Michelle:
Will Leona and Maxine

45:57.896 --> 45:59.965
live happily ever after?

45:59.965 --> 46:03.586
Is Diesel
the only man in Daytona?

46:03.586 --> 46:06.586
And who would invite
two prostitutes to a wedding?

46:06.586 --> 46:09.206
Don't you mean
three prostitutes?

46:09.206 --> 46:10.965
Tune in next time

46:10.965 --> 46:16.172
for more rip-roaring drama
onThe Daytona Wind.

46:18.206 --> 46:20.137
That was so iconic!

46:20.137 --> 46:22.103
Oh, my God.

46:22.103 --> 46:24.517
It makes perfect sense now!

46:24.517 --> 46:26.827
Wow, actresses.

46:26.827 --> 46:29.379
Who knew you had it in you?

46:31.206 --> 46:32.482
Ooh, Jesus.

46:32.482 --> 46:34.103
Coming up...

46:34.103 --> 46:35.827
You came in and nailed it.

46:35.827 --> 46:38.655
Those lips screamed
"prostitute."

46:40.344 --> 46:42.275
I definitely think
you could have gone further.

46:49.172 --> 46:54.758
Ladies, based on your
Daytona Windperformances

46:54.758 --> 46:58.000
and your Chaps On The Runway
presentations,

46:58.000 --> 46:59.758
I've made some decisions.

47:02.068 --> 47:04.379
When I call your name,
please step forward.

47:05.931 --> 47:08.482
DeJa Skye.

47:08.482 --> 47:10.862
Kerri Colby.

47:10.862 --> 47:14.655
Angeria Paris VanMicheals.

47:14.655 --> 47:17.517
Ladies, you are safe.

47:18.724 --> 47:20.172
Oh, my God.
Thank you.

47:21.413 --> 47:22.379
You may leave the stage.

47:26.862 --> 47:31.724
Ladies, you represent
the tops of the week.

47:34.034 --> 47:35.275
That's right.

47:35.275 --> 47:37.758
You all did
such an amazing job,

47:37.758 --> 47:40.448
this week there are no bottoms.

47:41.862 --> 47:44.137
Imagine that in West Hollywood.

47:46.586 --> 47:47.896
-Whew.
-Okay.

47:47.896 --> 47:50.931
Now we will determine

47:50.931 --> 47:53.827
who are the top two queens
of the week.

47:53.827 --> 47:56.689
And later, those two queens...

47:58.413 --> 48:00.413
will lip sync for the win.

48:01.862 --> 48:04.689
My, how the Daytona Winds
have shifted.

48:06.862 --> 48:09.551
Now it's time for
the judges' critiques,

48:09.551 --> 48:13.000
starting with Jorgeous.

48:13.000 --> 48:16.103
This chap outfit, you ever
heard of assless chaps?

48:16.103 --> 48:17.344
Yes.

48:17.344 --> 48:18.482
These are kind of
like chapless chaps.

48:18.482 --> 48:20.103
Okay.

48:20.103 --> 48:21.862
I don't know much about chaps,

48:21.862 --> 48:23.724
but I know that I want
that right there, honey.

48:23.724 --> 48:26.068
Give it to me in a 4X.

48:26.068 --> 48:27.758
Slide it over here.
I want it.

48:27.758 --> 48:29.379
-Okay.
-I'm assuming you grew up

48:29.379 --> 48:31.482
around mothers or sisters
watching novelas.

48:31.482 --> 48:32.793
Yes.

48:32.793 --> 48:34.689
Yeah, you got it.
Your timing was great.

48:34.689 --> 48:37.206
I definitely think
you could have gone further,

48:37.206 --> 48:39.586
but I really enjoyed
what you did.

48:39.586 --> 48:40.655
It made me laugh.

48:40.655 --> 48:41.827
I just came off of a win,

48:41.827 --> 48:44.034
so now I feel
so much more confident.

48:45.448 --> 48:46.724
Next up, Jasmine Kennedie.

48:46.724 --> 48:48.103
Hi.

48:48.103 --> 48:52.448
This outfit is absolutely
stupid ridiculous,

48:52.448 --> 48:54.206
and I love it.

48:54.206 --> 48:55.896
Did you go
to Chap-man University?

48:58.137 --> 48:59.689
Hattie Ruth Pointer O'Hara.

48:59.689 --> 49:02.068
I'm about to burst!

49:02.068 --> 49:06.034
Your version
of a Southern accent,

49:06.034 --> 49:08.103
it was, like,

49:11.172 --> 49:13.206
You know, one of my favorite
performances ever on film

49:13.206 --> 49:16.379
is Faye Dunaway as Joan Crawford
in Mommie Dearest.

49:16.379 --> 49:19.620
When you embrace that level
of stupidity and ridiculousness,

49:19.620 --> 49:22.896
it absolutely works.

49:22.896 --> 49:25.103
It was a work of fart.

49:27.758 --> 49:29.793
Up next, Lady Camden.

49:29.793 --> 49:31.448
Hello!

49:31.448 --> 49:33.896
That was such a fun runway.
I love a reveal

49:33.896 --> 49:35.275
that I don't even know
is happening.

49:35.275 --> 49:36.827
It was just so exciting.

49:36.827 --> 49:39.965
I love this outfit,
love Freddie Mercury,

49:39.965 --> 49:41.862
and love the theatrics
that you pulled.

49:41.862 --> 49:43.896
Maxine!

49:43.896 --> 49:45.965
Maxine!

49:45.965 --> 49:47.551
You did an excellent job.

49:47.551 --> 49:48.793
That's what I like to see,

49:48.793 --> 49:50.620
somebody just go in there
and pull it out

49:50.620 --> 49:52.103
and make me feel it.

49:52.103 --> 49:54.172
Wait a minute, Ru.
Am I talking about--

49:54.172 --> 49:56.413
-Oh, okay.
-I was wondering.

49:56.413 --> 49:58.241
Your performance
was heightened.

49:58.241 --> 49:59.482
Not again.

49:59.482 --> 50:01.000
But it was believable,
it was acting.

50:01.000 --> 50:04.034
Your conviction was complete.

50:04.034 --> 50:06.586
It was amazing.
Well done.

50:08.344 --> 50:13.172
Up next, Daya Betty.

50:13.172 --> 50:14.413
I thought you nailed it.

50:14.413 --> 50:17.206
We have something to say.

50:17.206 --> 50:20.862
You were another one that
really commanded the camera.

50:20.862 --> 50:23.793
You came in with an intention,
and you delivered.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
Those lips screamed
"prostitute."

50:29.344 --> 50:31.344
You did a really,
really good job.

50:31.344 --> 50:34.344
This look, it is gor-geous.

50:34.344 --> 50:38.689
There's even, like, a bootcut
boot flare on that chap.

50:38.689 --> 50:41.724
It's so, so fashion,
and it's so, so drag.

50:41.724 --> 50:44.413
On the runway, perfection.

50:44.413 --> 50:47.689
In the challenge,
you were so good.

50:47.689 --> 50:51.275
This is the week
that you showed up.

50:51.275 --> 50:52.482
Per-fec-tion.

50:53.551 --> 50:54.862
I know that I've been, like,

50:54.862 --> 50:58.931
getting kind of lost
in the past few weeks,

50:58.931 --> 51:01.344
and it's really
been getting to me.

51:01.344 --> 51:05.103
So I'm really happy
I'm able to show you guys

51:05.103 --> 51:06.758
that I could do it.

51:06.758 --> 51:07.862
Well done, Daya Betty.

51:07.862 --> 51:08.862
Thank you, guys.

51:08.862 --> 51:11.172
Up next, Willow Pill.

51:11.172 --> 51:13.482
Your performance was adorable.

51:13.482 --> 51:15.724
Got lost in the email.

51:15.724 --> 51:16.931
I actually really enjoyed it.

51:16.931 --> 51:18.862
My one note for that character

51:18.862 --> 51:22.068
is you were basically
being Moira Rose.

51:22.068 --> 51:23.103
You did a great job at it.

51:23.103 --> 51:24.586
It would probably be

51:24.586 --> 51:26.724
a really good Snatch Game
character for you.

51:26.724 --> 51:27.793
I understand
what Michelle's saying,

51:27.793 --> 51:29.862
but I didn't mind it so much.

51:29.862 --> 51:31.931
You know why I love this outfit

51:31.931 --> 51:35.517
is because
it is next-level silly,

51:35.517 --> 51:37.275
but it's also fashion.

51:37.275 --> 51:38.275
Mm-hmm.

51:38.275 --> 51:39.379
-It's beautiful.
-Thank you.

51:39.379 --> 51:40.655
The hands in the hair, girl,

51:40.655 --> 51:42.034
I thought you was
offering me the weave.

51:42.034 --> 51:44.344
I was over here, like,
gimme, gimme, gimme.

51:44.344 --> 51:45.586
Yeah, I love it.

51:45.586 --> 51:46.896
Willow, you are a superstar.

51:46.896 --> 51:49.137
Everything you do,

51:49.137 --> 51:51.413
you've got that
extra something to it.

51:51.413 --> 51:54.793
The two of you together,
just really, really good.

51:54.793 --> 51:56.379
Thank you.

51:56.379 --> 51:58.137
Up next, it's Bosco.

51:58.137 --> 51:59.448
Hello.

51:59.448 --> 52:01.551
When you take that role
at the end,

52:01.551 --> 52:04.206
that is such a risk.

52:04.206 --> 52:07.275
You came and nailed it.

52:07.275 --> 52:11.758
I'm here to spill the tea on
all of you Daytona hypocrites.

52:11.758 --> 52:13.931
I knew who you were right away,

52:13.931 --> 52:17.724
from "action" until Ru
said "cut the cheese."

52:19.862 --> 52:22.827
This look is gorgeous.

52:22.827 --> 52:24.448
As you can see, I love pink.

52:24.448 --> 52:27.551
Honey, because pussy
is pink, baby.

52:27.551 --> 52:29.000
Is it? Really?

52:29.000 --> 52:30.344
First I've heard.

52:30.344 --> 52:33.241
And you were wonderful
in the soap opera.

52:33.241 --> 52:35.172
Why did you choose that role?

52:35.172 --> 52:37.068
I saw it was
the Joan Collins moment.

52:37.068 --> 52:40.931
So I really just, like, kind of
dug my claws into that part.

52:40.931 --> 52:43.000
Well, thank you, Bosco.
You were wonderful.

52:43.000 --> 52:44.517
Thank you.

52:44.517 --> 52:46.310
Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

52:46.310 --> 52:49.000
While you untuck
in the werkroom,

52:49.000 --> 52:50.965
the judges and I
will deliberate.

52:52.379 --> 52:54.586
All right, now, just between
us squirrel friends,

52:54.586 --> 52:56.586
what do you think?

52:56.586 --> 52:59.724
We've got a wealth of talent
on this stage,

52:59.724 --> 53:03.206
but we're looking for
the top two queens of the week,

53:03.206 --> 53:04.965
starting with Jorgeous.

53:04.965 --> 53:06.931
Was it great? Absolutely.

53:06.931 --> 53:09.344
But I know that that girl
could have gone bigger.

53:09.344 --> 53:10.827
I'm an insatiable bottom today.

53:10.827 --> 53:12.068
-Oh.
-Oh.

53:12.068 --> 53:13.793
I want more, and I want it big.

53:13.793 --> 53:15.931
-Oh!
-I can't relate.

53:17.758 --> 53:19.413
Jasmine Kennedie.

53:19.413 --> 53:23.724
I thought her performance as
Alyssa Edwards was perfection.

53:26.551 --> 53:29.896
I mean, I don't know if
she meant to be this iconic,

53:29.896 --> 53:31.896
but it is.

53:31.896 --> 53:33.758
-Just amazing.
-Yeah.

53:33.758 --> 53:35.448
Lady Camden.

53:35.448 --> 53:36.655
She sold the story.

53:36.655 --> 53:38.034
There was a level
of believability

53:38.034 --> 53:39.241
in this performance
that we don't--

53:39.241 --> 53:40.586
I'm just gonna say it--

53:40.586 --> 53:41.896
don't usually get
on RuPaul's Drag Race.

53:41.896 --> 53:43.655
-Right, right.
-I thought it was amazing.

53:43.655 --> 53:45.344
Then let's talk
about the runway.

53:45.344 --> 53:48.137
Okay, that's how
you shock us on a runway.

53:48.137 --> 53:49.551
-Yeah.
-Didn't see that coming.

53:49.551 --> 53:51.896
She gave what had supposed
to be had been given.

53:53.758 --> 53:56.344
All right, let's move on
to Daya Betty.

53:56.344 --> 53:59.206
She nailed every line she had,

53:59.206 --> 54:02.068
and in a small part,
that's how you steal the scene.

54:02.068 --> 54:05.379
I loved the delivery,
I loved the over-drawn lips.

54:05.379 --> 54:07.448
It was so, so good.
And then on the runway,

54:07.448 --> 54:10.344
I'm gonna say my favorite look
of the night.

54:10.344 --> 54:12.172
-Mm.
-That was so stunning.

54:12.172 --> 54:16.103
This is the week that Daya Betty
made her mark here,

54:16.103 --> 54:20.068
and she's not just a carbon copy
of her drag mother.

54:20.068 --> 54:21.241
Mm.

54:21.241 --> 54:22.655
Willow Pill.

54:22.655 --> 54:25.413
Here is an example
of a queen taking a small part

54:25.413 --> 54:29.000
and executing it flawlessly,
with precision.

54:29.000 --> 54:30.482
The thing that bothered me

54:30.482 --> 54:31.793
a little bit about
Willow's performance

54:31.793 --> 54:34.551
was that she was doing
somebody's material.

54:34.551 --> 54:36.379
Now, I didn't mind that
she was doing Moira Rose in it.

54:36.379 --> 54:38.310
In fact, I've been doing
Faye Dunaway

54:38.310 --> 54:40.172
for about 30 years.

54:40.172 --> 54:42.896
Love me some Willow Pill.
Good night for her.

54:42.896 --> 54:44.068
Bosco.

54:44.068 --> 54:46.620
She managed to come in
at the very end

54:46.620 --> 54:47.931
and sort of steal the show.

54:47.931 --> 54:49.551
And she's willing
to express herself

54:49.551 --> 54:50.551
in a bunch of different ways,

54:50.551 --> 54:52.034
which, by the way,

54:52.034 --> 54:54.655
is how you go really far
in this competition.

54:54.655 --> 54:56.827
She understood
the Reba McEntire reference.

54:56.827 --> 55:00.724
She also understood
the Alexis Carrington reference.

55:00.724 --> 55:03.655
She is smart enough
to take that information

55:03.655 --> 55:05.379
and work with it.

55:07.896 --> 55:09.758
Silence!

55:13.137 --> 55:14.448
Does somebody smell something?

55:14.448 --> 55:15.482
Ooh!

55:15.482 --> 55:18.000
I've made my decision.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.724
Bring back my girls.

55:20.724 --> 55:21.758
Whew.

55:27.137 --> 55:29.724
Welcome back, ladies.

55:29.724 --> 55:32.000
I've made some decisions.

55:33.448 --> 55:34.689
Jorgeous.

55:34.689 --> 55:37.655
If you don't wanna
toot your own horn,

55:37.655 --> 55:39.379
we'll do it for you.

55:40.758 --> 55:42.068
You're safe.

55:42.068 --> 55:43.758
Thank you! Bye.

55:46.551 --> 55:47.586
Jasmine Kennedie.

55:47.586 --> 55:51.137
This week you were a gas.

55:52.482 --> 55:53.482
You're safe.

55:53.482 --> 55:54.551
Thank you.

56:02.620 --> 56:05.310
Lady Camden.

56:05.310 --> 56:06.275
You smell that?

56:08.068 --> 56:10.482
It's the sweet smell of success.

56:10.482 --> 56:12.310
Con-drag-ulations.

56:12.310 --> 56:15.103
You are one of the top two
queens of the week.

56:15.103 --> 56:16.655
Thank you.

56:16.655 --> 56:18.827
Top two. Bitch,
better start this engine.

56:18.827 --> 56:19.931
Let's go.

56:23.206 --> 56:24.965
Bosco.

56:24.965 --> 56:28.068
You had one chance, Fancy,

56:28.068 --> 56:29.793
and you did not let us down.

56:31.758 --> 56:32.793
You're safe.

56:32.793 --> 56:34.241
Thank you.

56:38.724 --> 56:40.586
Willow Pill.

56:40.586 --> 56:42.034
this week you had us

56:42.034 --> 56:44.379
eating out of the palm
of your hands.

56:44.379 --> 56:46.517
Daya Betty.

56:46.517 --> 56:49.482
Did somebody light a match?

56:49.482 --> 56:53.172
Because this week,
your pussy is on fire.

56:54.310 --> 56:55.275
Daya Betty.

56:58.344 --> 56:59.862
Con-drag-ulations.

56:59.862 --> 57:02.379
You are one of the top two
queens of the week.

57:03.482 --> 57:08.137
Thank God
I am finally in the top.

57:08.137 --> 57:10.068
I'm standing out finally.

57:10.068 --> 57:12.034
Willow Pill, you are safe,

57:12.034 --> 57:14.000
and you may join
the other girls.

57:14.000 --> 57:15.896
Thank you.

57:15.896 --> 57:18.310
Give Willow Pill a hand.

57:20.724 --> 57:21.965
But a willow hand.

57:24.758 --> 57:26.965
Two queens stand before me.

57:26.965 --> 57:28.689
Prior to tonight,

57:28.689 --> 57:32.137
you were asked to prepare
a lip sync performance

57:32.137 --> 57:36.793
of One Way or Another
by the great Blondie.

57:38.206 --> 57:41.931
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

57:41.931 --> 57:47.310
and win a cash tip of $5,000.

57:49.068 --> 57:51.137
The time has come...

57:51.137 --> 57:53.655
to lip sync...

57:53.655 --> 57:56.517
for the win!

57:58.862 --> 58:03.758
It feels awesome to share
this top two moment

58:03.758 --> 58:05.862
with Lady Camden right now.

58:05.862 --> 58:08.827
But this is my moment,

58:08.827 --> 58:11.655
and I'm gonna beat
Lady Camden's ass.

58:11.655 --> 58:15.586
I'm sorry. This is
my fucking song, bitch.

58:15.586 --> 58:17.275
I'm feeling good right now.

58:17.275 --> 58:19.275
Like, I just know
I'm gonna smoke her.

58:20.482 --> 58:26.586
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

59:27.620 --> 59:29.241
Daya is doing the guitar solo,

59:29.241 --> 59:31.724
she's giving punky
little Edge vibes.

59:31.724 --> 59:35.551
Camden is giving all these
funny, campy moments.

59:35.551 --> 59:36.758
It is a close call.

59:42.206 --> 59:44.689
Lady Camden has come alive.

59:45.758 --> 59:47.965
I'm like, girl,
she is on fire.

1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:24.517
That was sickening!

1:00:24.517 --> 1:00:26.241
Oh, my God!

1:00:26.241 --> 1:00:29.103
-I'm gonna get ya!
-I'm gonna get ya!

1:00:29.103 --> 1:00:30.655
That was everything.

1:00:30.655 --> 1:00:33.896
Ladies, I've made my decision.

1:00:40.275 --> 1:00:41.344
Lady Camden.

1:00:42.379 --> 1:00:43.620
You're a winner, baby.

1:00:48.034 --> 1:00:50.000
Yes!

1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:51.689
Fuck yes.

1:00:51.689 --> 1:00:52.862
Con-drag-ulations.

1:00:52.862 --> 1:00:55.827
You've won
a cash tip of $5,000.

1:01:00.068 --> 1:01:02.310
I'm so happy right now.

1:01:02.310 --> 1:01:04.965
I'm so honored and thankful.
Thank you guys.

1:01:04.965 --> 1:01:09.379
Daya Betty, you are safe
to slay another day.

1:01:09.379 --> 1:01:11.758
Thank y'all. Thank you.

1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:16.931
Con-drag-ulations, ladies.

1:01:16.931 --> 1:01:18.448
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1:01:18.448 --> 1:01:20.931
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

1:01:20.931 --> 1:01:22.517
Can I get an "amen" up in here?

1:01:22.517 --> 1:01:23.724
-Amen!
-Amen!

1:01:23.724 --> 1:01:26.758
All right.
Now let the music play!

1:01:39.965 --> 1:01:41.620
Next time
onRuPaul's Drag Race...

1:01:41.620 --> 1:01:45.448
You'll be performing
a brand-new retro hit.

1:01:52.551 --> 1:01:54.000
She likes to watch.

1:01:55.310 --> 1:01:56.275
Oh, shit.

1:01:57.379 --> 1:01:58.862
You nailed it.

1:01:58.862 --> 1:02:00.241
You gave us
that sixties glamour.

1:02:00.241 --> 1:02:01.931
You need to find your spotlight.

1:02:01.931 --> 1:02:03.724
You don't wanna fade
into the background.

1:02:03.724 --> 1:02:06.413
You had said
some things about me

1:02:06.413 --> 1:02:08.448
that you have not yet said
to my face.

1:02:08.448 --> 1:02:11.034
Let me tell you something,
you shady fucking bitch.

1:02:11.034 --> 1:02:13.241
-Oh!
-I'm about to go

1:02:13.241 --> 1:02:15.000
and start cutting
people's heads off, honey.
