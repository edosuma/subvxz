00:00.273 --> 00:02.343
Previously, on The Royals...

00:06.139 --> 00:07.971
What do you want?

00:08.041 --> 00:09.574
Spencer, this is...

00:09.643 --> 00:12.143
Jack Parker. Of course.

00:12.212 --> 00:14.112
I love you.

00:16.283 --> 00:18.750
I look just like my Majesty again.

00:18.818 --> 00:20.785
Good for you, Chad.

00:20.854 --> 00:23.188
My family owns quite a bit
of coastal real estate,

00:23.256 --> 00:25.623
all over the world. I want you to style.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.892
We'd be on the road the next six months.

00:27.961 --> 00:29.661
I'm leaving soon.

00:29.729 --> 00:32.430
I'm leaving all of this behind.
Including you.

00:32.832 --> 00:34.966
- Please, Len...
- Hey.

00:36.436 --> 00:40.371
You'd better make sure your safety's
off because, I assure you, mine is.

00:40.440 --> 00:43.341
Before the Council hearings,
you said you heard from Boone.

00:43.410 --> 00:45.476
Was it about Robert?

00:45.545 --> 00:47.445
Then it's important I know.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.074

00:57.023 --> 00:59.857
Son. It's time.

01:12.239 --> 01:15.740
Chess. The game of kings.

01:18.511 --> 01:21.913
You can learn a lot about a man's
character from how he plays chess.

01:21.982 --> 01:24.482
What can you tell about me, Dad?

01:24.551 --> 01:26.918
That's yet to be determined, my son.

01:38.498 --> 01:40.331
'Barricades have been placed

01:40.400 --> 01:42.166
and security has been heightened

01:42.235 --> 01:45.303
in anticipation of the
largest crowd in history,

01:45.372 --> 01:48.473
to witness tomorrow's
Coronation of Prince Robert.

01:48.541 --> 01:51.175
As you can see behind me,
extra police are present,

01:51.244 --> 01:54.078
and the royal box is
eagerly being prepared.

01:54.147 --> 01:56.414
Everywhere you look,
there is an outpouring

01:56.483 --> 01:59.350
of optimism and pride and exuberance

01:59.419 --> 02:03.288
that has manifested itself into
block parties and nationalism

02:03.356 --> 02:05.823
not witnessed in a long, long while.'

02:17.837 --> 02:20.872
Safe passage, you beautiful bastard.

02:22.275 --> 02:24.275
It happened again!

02:27.113 --> 02:29.213
I'm gonna kill him.

02:29.282 --> 02:30.782
If he doesn't invite
us to the Coronation,

02:30.850 --> 02:33.170
I'm buying a gun and
climbing the clock tower.

02:33.172 --> 02:34.553
You can't afford a gun.

02:35.588 --> 02:38.323
When the next King of England
is dating your sister,

02:38.391 --> 02:39.957
you assume you'll be invited.

02:40.026 --> 02:41.926
We're not officially dating.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.996
People recognize you in the street.

02:45.065 --> 02:47.131
We had press outside for days.

02:47.200 --> 02:50.601
And you know why? Because you're dating.

02:53.073 --> 02:55.973
Yeah, I'm not doing that. Yoga sucks.

02:57.544 --> 02:59.677
When was the last time
you heard from him?

03:00.880 --> 03:02.947
The night of the Privy Council.

03:04.017 --> 03:06.951
But he's had loads to deal with.
He'll reach out.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.354
He's... not like that.

03:10.390 --> 03:12.490
You're good enough to be Queen.

03:13.393 --> 03:15.059
Thanks, Ange.

03:16.363 --> 03:19.063
I think it's important
we restrict your access

03:19.132 --> 03:20.765
before the Coronation tomorrow.

03:20.834 --> 03:23.601
Build up a sense of anticipation.

03:23.670 --> 03:26.971
Well, I need to step out for a bit.
But I will do it quietly.

03:27.040 --> 03:30.108
I think your days of doing things
quietly are long gone, darling.

03:30.176 --> 03:32.410
- Where are you going?
- Kathryn's.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.312
Helena.

03:35.515 --> 03:37.281
Did you just refer to Her Majesty
the Queen by her first name?

03:37.350 --> 03:40.184
- Jack's plane has crashed.
- Oh, my God.

03:40.253 --> 03:42.520
I'm so sorry.

03:59.439 --> 04:02.273
Hey! All packed?

04:02.342 --> 04:04.475
Nearly.

04:04.544 --> 04:07.412
We did say six months, correct?

04:07.480 --> 04:09.247
Do you think I've under-packed?

04:09.883 --> 04:12.250
It's not fair!

04:15.955 --> 04:18.423
I don't want you to leave.

04:24.097 --> 04:27.598
I've never been away from the
family for more than a week or two.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.734
You can do this. It's gonna be great.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.669
He's a visionary, our future King.

04:32.539 --> 04:34.172
How do you mean?

04:34.314 --> 04:37.467
He told me when he invited me to the
People's Gala that he thought we'd get on,

04:38.058 --> 04:39.891
and he was right.

04:39.893 --> 04:42.127
I'll see you in a bit.

05:07.639 --> 05:10.420
- sync and corrections by King C -
- www.addic7ed.com -

05:13.947 --> 05:15.847
You lied.

05:15.915 --> 05:17.248
Is that my flight helmet?

05:17.317 --> 05:19.250
I don't know. Is it?

05:19.319 --> 05:21.519
Is this really happening right now?

05:21.588 --> 05:24.555
You disappear for days and
then you show up like this?

05:24.624 --> 05:26.023
Did you go to the island?

05:27.227 --> 05:28.993
You said you leapt at the first
chance you had to come home.

05:29.062 --> 05:31.462
But I did a little research,

05:31.531 --> 05:34.699
and that boat came right
past you several times.

05:34.767 --> 05:36.534
Wow.

05:36.603 --> 05:38.269
Do you know what it was like

05:38.338 --> 05:40.605
on that island, Sherlock Holmes?

05:40.673 --> 05:42.406
What the storms were really like?

05:42.675 --> 05:45.176
How black night really gets?

05:45.945 --> 05:48.246
While you were here doing
whatever you were doing

05:48.314 --> 05:50.214
to whoever you were doing it to,

05:50.283 --> 05:53.084
- I was trying to survive.
- Maybe so,

05:53.152 --> 05:55.086
but you weren't trying
to come home, were you?

05:55.154 --> 05:57.221
You don't know what the
hell you're talking about.

05:57.290 --> 05:59.390
I think I do.

05:59.459 --> 06:01.392
Liam, just say it.

06:01.461 --> 06:04.262
You wanted me to die on that
island so you could be King.

06:04.964 --> 06:07.331
You hate that I came back. Just say it.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.834
No. I hate that you didn't come back.

06:09.903 --> 06:11.836
Because while you were
hiding on that island,

06:11.905 --> 06:13.604
like the damn coward that you are,

06:13.673 --> 06:15.806
I was here watching Dad die.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.577
Don't you mean letting him die?
Or more specifically,

06:19.646 --> 06:22.013
letting him get stabbed
while you fondled the help?

06:25.818 --> 06:28.486
- Jasper, let me go!
- Jasper, do not let him go.

06:28.555 --> 06:31.355
- I'm giving you an order.
- Jasper works for me now.

06:31.424 --> 06:34.225
Talk some sense into him
before he disgraces all of us.

06:34.294 --> 06:37.295
- You're a liar and a coward.
- No, I'm not.

06:37.363 --> 06:40.164
I am a king. The King.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.967
And the next time you see me, you bow.

06:43.036 --> 06:45.136
you.

07:09.544 --> 07:12.878
Merely because it's the
most powerful piece,

07:12.896 --> 07:14.929
doesn't mean it's infallible.

07:16.045 --> 07:18.512
Never underestimate the
value of your pawns.

07:19.048 --> 07:21.482
- Pawns are weak.
- Not true.

07:22.185 --> 07:25.019
Every piece has its part to play.

07:25.088 --> 07:29.590
And, sometimes, your pawns
can hold the key to victory.

07:34.931 --> 07:36.597
Checkmate.

07:37.967 --> 07:40.301
We'll play again tomorrow.

07:43.439 --> 07:45.506
I love you, my son.

07:58.888 --> 08:01.288
Mum.

08:01.357 --> 08:03.491
I just heard. What happened?

08:04.026 --> 08:06.327
They've located the wreckage.

08:06.395 --> 08:09.764
There's nothing left. No survivors.

08:09.832 --> 08:12.666
Oh, Mum. I'm sorry.

08:13.903 --> 08:16.137
Should we cancel the Coronation?

08:17.073 --> 08:21.609
Darling, I hardly knew the man.

08:21.677 --> 08:23.911
I feel sorry for his family, of course.

08:23.980 --> 08:26.647
But let's not be too dramatic.

08:26.716 --> 08:30.551
You could have been on that plane,
so let's not be too casual, either.

08:36.592 --> 08:39.360
I'm here if you need to talk.

08:39.428 --> 08:42.863
I just... I just need a little space.

08:45.168 --> 08:47.234
I understand.

08:50.273 --> 08:52.807
Eleanor...

08:53.176 --> 08:55.442
Live your life.

08:55.511 --> 08:58.045
Chase whatever makes your heart race.

08:58.114 --> 09:01.949
Jack made his mark. Make yours.

09:03.219 --> 09:04.718
I will.

09:14.130 --> 09:16.197
What's going on here?

09:16.532 --> 09:18.532
Get out of here!

09:25.808 --> 09:28.728
Now, now. I thought we were
practicing our etiquette.

09:28.730 --> 09:29.811
Really, Robert?

09:29.879 --> 09:34.148
Not enough taking my crown,
now you're taking my room?

09:34.217 --> 09:36.917
The crown is transient, as is this room.

09:36.986 --> 09:39.720
It's the King's room, not your room.
You know that.

09:39.789 --> 09:43.457
- So you're kicking me out?
- Of this room? Perhaps.

09:43.526 --> 09:46.527
- Of the palace? Well, that depends.
- On what?

09:46.596 --> 09:50.865
On whether or not you can control
about 90% of your bullshit.

09:51.434 --> 09:53.334
Find a purpose, dear Uncle.

09:53.402 --> 09:55.569
Otherwise, you're gone.

09:56.405 --> 10:02.109
I wish you would have done us all a favor and
died on that island, you little arsehole.

10:02.178 --> 10:04.245
That seems to be going around.

10:15.091 --> 10:18.058
- Can I help you?
- No.

10:18.127 --> 10:20.027
Let me rephrase that.

10:20.096 --> 10:21.829
Please exit the Princess's room.

10:26.402 --> 10:28.502
The safety's off this time.

10:38.514 --> 10:40.848
Hey. I got your text. What's up?

10:40.917 --> 10:42.783
I went to the island. Come here.

10:43.352 --> 10:46.020
Island? Robbie's island?

10:46.088 --> 10:47.988
- Sit down.
- Liam!

10:48.057 --> 10:50.424
He didn't come home like he said he did.

10:50.493 --> 10:52.860
So you're saying he's
still on the island,

10:52.929 --> 10:56.030
and this Robbie is a... is a clone?

10:56.098 --> 10:59.099
Or a robot? His evil twin!

10:59.168 --> 11:00.668
- Len.
- Yeah.

11:01.370 --> 11:02.970
Think about it.

11:03.039 --> 11:05.706
He got you to do his dirty
work at the Privy Council.

11:05.775 --> 11:08.609
He turned Mum and Kathryn away from me.

11:09.412 --> 11:12.379
He didn't get me to do anything,

11:12.448 --> 11:14.415
and he's not turned anyone against you.

11:15.952 --> 11:19.553
Liam, the crown was his before
it was an option for you.

11:20.957 --> 11:23.457
I'm sorry, Liam, but so was Kathryn.

11:24.293 --> 11:26.727
So you don't believe me.

11:26.796 --> 11:28.762
I know you wanted to be King.

11:29.899 --> 11:33.067
But this is Robert that
we're talking about.

11:33.135 --> 11:34.868
But is it?

11:35.571 --> 11:37.104
Wow...

11:37.173 --> 11:40.941
Len, don't go. I need you to understand.

11:41.477 --> 11:43.110
Here's what I understand.

11:43.179 --> 11:45.746
You and I were always the spares.

11:45.815 --> 11:48.916
This was always Robert's destiny.

11:50.086 --> 11:52.219
As far as I can tell, nothing's changed.

11:52.288 --> 11:55.289
I've changed. Me.

11:55.358 --> 11:57.458
Yeah, I think you have changed, Liam.

11:57.643 --> 12:00.978
You're acting like Cyrus.
Get your shit together.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.017
What's going on?

12:14.166 --> 12:16.300
Dad's portrait should be in a museum.

12:16.368 --> 12:19.336
Why? I've always liked it here.
I like having him close.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.271
That's because he inspires you.

12:21.488 --> 12:24.723
Don't you think the rest of the
nation should be inspired by him too?

12:24.792 --> 12:26.626
We can't be selfish, Len.

12:26.694 --> 12:30.096
Especially when it comes
to things that inspire us.

12:30.164 --> 12:31.998
I like being selfish.

12:33.968 --> 12:36.502
- Robbie, I need to ask you something.
- Mm-hm.

12:36.571 --> 12:40.239
Did you invite Sebastian to
the People's Gala to meet me?

12:40.308 --> 12:42.575
I invited him to the People's Gala.

12:42.644 --> 12:44.977
Right. Why didn't you ever tell me that?

12:45.045 --> 12:47.212
I didn't think it was relevant. Is it?

12:47.282 --> 12:51.017
It kind of feels like you were
setting me up and not telling me.

12:51.085 --> 12:52.652
Well, let's say I was.

12:52.720 --> 12:54.787
Let's say you had just
broken up with Jasper,

12:54.856 --> 12:57.723
you were going through an immense
amount of turmoil and drama,

12:57.792 --> 13:01.527
and I thought you'd enjoy hanging out
with someone kind and drama-free.

13:02.196 --> 13:04.397
You should have told me.

13:04.465 --> 13:08.734
Had I told you, you would have
definitely not given him a chance.

13:08.803 --> 13:11.270
But you did. And you like him, yes?

13:11.339 --> 13:14.440
- Yes...
- Then you're welcome.

13:15.443 --> 13:18.210
So, shall we talk about Jasper?

13:18.279 --> 13:20.246
He is now my security detail.

13:20.315 --> 13:21.881
Yeah, what's that about?

13:21.950 --> 13:23.683
He's excellent at what he does.

13:23.751 --> 13:26.285
And I want to keep an eye on him.

13:27.321 --> 13:29.287
Anything going on between you two?

13:29.924 --> 13:34.527
Not since I poured my heart out
to him in a Christmas letter

13:34.595 --> 13:37.096
and he... crushed me with silence.

13:38.599 --> 13:40.800
Well, is there any
chance he didn't get it?

13:40.868 --> 13:42.601
No, he got it.

13:43.371 --> 13:45.471
He just... pushed me away

13:45.540 --> 13:48.107
because of some typical Jasper code.

13:49.744 --> 13:52.778
- Maybe it's better that you're apart.
- Yeah.

13:53.614 --> 13:57.083
Sometimes you think that you've
reached the end of something...

13:57.151 --> 13:59.251
when actually it's only the beginning.

14:00.121 --> 14:03.155
I should know I was dead once.

14:06.327 --> 14:08.327
Thanks.

14:30.218 --> 14:32.018
Your Majesty?

14:32.754 --> 14:36.722
We need to make sure the candles
are even in the corridor tomorrow.

14:37.224 --> 14:38.723
Candles?

14:40.161 --> 14:41.961
They bother me when they're uneven.

14:43.931 --> 14:46.732
- Would you like to talk about it?
- No.

14:46.801 --> 14:48.934
Just make sure they're even.

14:49.003 --> 14:51.937
Jack. Would you like to talk about Jack?

14:52.006 --> 14:54.440
Don't be disingenuous, Mr. Hoenigsberg.

14:54.509 --> 14:56.275
You couldn't stand Jack.

14:56.344 --> 14:59.278
I couldn't stand that he got
to spend time with you,

14:59.347 --> 15:01.247
and that... he was compelling to you.

15:01.315 --> 15:04.116
But you cared for him,
and I care for you.

15:04.752 --> 15:06.218
I'm fine.

15:07.688 --> 15:09.889
Maybe no candles in the corridor.

15:09.957 --> 15:11.957
Shut up.

15:12.760 --> 15:14.860
Come here.

15:29.077 --> 15:31.377
Liam! Hi.

15:31.446 --> 15:33.412
Everything okay? I got your text.

15:33.481 --> 15:35.047
Text? What text?

15:35.318 --> 15:37.752
Robert won't call her. Gotta go. Bye.

15:40.476 --> 15:43.410
Angie must have my password. Come in.

15:52.466 --> 15:54.666
- Hey.
- Hi.

15:59.107 --> 16:01.974
- What's wrong with you?
- The Princess is leaving.

16:02.043 --> 16:04.443
What's wrong with you?

16:04.512 --> 16:06.645
The Princess is leaving.

16:06.714 --> 16:08.647
You're supposed to stop her.

16:08.716 --> 16:11.517
You're supposed to live
happily ever after.

16:11.586 --> 16:14.687
Yeah, well, I think that
only happens in storybooks.

16:14.755 --> 16:16.288
So they were lying, then?

16:16.357 --> 16:19.758
About princesses and happily ever after?

16:19.827 --> 16:22.194
No. They're not lying.

16:22.597 --> 16:25.064
I mean, some of it's
not actually factual.

16:25.133 --> 16:29.201
There is golden hair and clear
heels, but there's, um...

16:29.270 --> 16:32.138
different kind of girls wear them.

16:32.206 --> 16:36.075
Anyway, happily ever after is real...

16:37.512 --> 16:39.912
..and you should believe in that. Okay?

16:39.981 --> 16:41.614
I guess so.

16:41.682 --> 16:44.950
- Promise me you will.
- I will.

16:50.391 --> 16:52.558
Do you love her?

16:54.262 --> 16:55.594
Yeah. I do.

16:55.663 --> 16:58.230
You should probably tell her that.

16:58.666 --> 17:00.399
Yeah.

17:27.702 --> 17:30.264
Have you come for my other nut?

17:30.366 --> 17:32.799
- Did you do it?
- Did I do what?

17:32.868 --> 17:34.601
Jack's plane.

17:34.670 --> 17:37.337
Sucks when you lose someone
you care about, doesn't it?

17:37.406 --> 17:40.741
- Did you do it?
- No, I didn't do it.

17:42.344 --> 17:45.612
I'm gonna ruin your little
coronation tomorrow.

17:45.681 --> 17:48.949
I'm gonna blow my goddamn brains out.

17:49.018 --> 17:50.884
Good luck avoiding that topic.

17:50.953 --> 17:53.820
Fine. Blow your goddamn brains out.

17:53.889 --> 17:57.090
I'm sure they'll mention it
somewhere around page 7.

17:57.660 --> 18:01.195
He invited you to go with
him, didn't he? Jack.

18:01.263 --> 18:03.764
Shame you didn't go.

18:04.900 --> 18:07.534
Let me know if you need
help pulling the trigger.

18:07.603 --> 18:09.102
I'll get Robert to do it.

18:09.171 --> 18:11.838
He has sovereign immunity now.

18:45.841 --> 18:47.241
Whoa.

18:48.677 --> 18:51.178
I had to try on my dress before the
Coronation. And, look, check it out!

18:51.647 --> 18:54.982
- Glass slippers?
- Glass slippers. Just for you.

18:56.752 --> 18:59.019
What you got there?

19:00.589 --> 19:02.923
It's for you. It's your story.

19:02.992 --> 19:05.459
- My story?
- Yours and Jasper's.

19:05.527 --> 19:07.494
He's called Frosty the
Caterpillar in it.

19:07.563 --> 19:09.496
Where did you find this?

19:09.565 --> 19:14.101
He put it away on Christmas. But
he was really sad about it.

19:14.169 --> 19:17.104
And I even think he cried.

19:17.172 --> 19:19.573
I'll pretend that I
didn't hear that part.

19:21.810 --> 19:23.810
Thank you for giving me this.

19:23.879 --> 19:26.413
Do you like it?

19:28.083 --> 19:29.883
I do.

19:30.619 --> 19:32.686
I like it very much.

19:32.755 --> 19:36.089
"So Alice told Frosty to
make the Princess happy."

19:45.534 --> 19:47.234
What's going on?

19:47.636 --> 19:50.137
I just haven't heard from him...

19:50.205 --> 19:52.806
- since the night...
- He became King.

19:55.477 --> 19:57.244
I'll talk to him.

20:02.284 --> 20:06.186
Liam. Why would you do that for me?

20:07.389 --> 20:10.891
I'd do anything for you, Kathryn.
You know that.

20:55.337 --> 20:57.437
You need to be good to her.

20:57.506 --> 20:59.773
Why are you so concerned about Kathryn?

20:59.842 --> 21:02.609
I was there, every step of the way.

21:03.145 --> 21:05.612
'Don't do this to her.'

23:34.819 --> 23:36.652
Ah.

23:45.396 --> 23:47.963
- Just stepping away for a moment.
- That's fine.

23:48.032 --> 23:50.199
- Does anyone need me?
- Nope. Not yet.

24:38.015 --> 24:41.683
Your Highness... soon
to be Your Majesty?

24:42.586 --> 24:44.620
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes.

24:44.688 --> 24:48.657
I made some adjustments to your
list of potential brides for me.

24:48.726 --> 24:51.077
I hope the sorting hat
isn't too disappointed.

24:51.929 --> 24:54.396
I placed them in order of preference.

24:54.765 --> 24:56.531
Why go on a series of bad dates

24:56.600 --> 24:58.967
- if your first choice works out?
- Exactly.

25:00.237 --> 25:03.639
Oh, and Willow, let's keep
this between us for now.

25:03.707 --> 25:05.908
I'll speak with the Queen
after the Coronation.

25:06.644 --> 25:09.378
Of course. Between us for now.

25:23.761 --> 25:26.428
Princess wants to see you.
I'll take over here.

25:29.867 --> 25:31.667
Don't screw it up.

25:44.648 --> 25:45.881
Hey.

25:47.384 --> 25:49.418
Uh, you wanted to see me?

25:50.220 --> 25:52.387
- No.
- No?

25:53.090 --> 25:54.389
No.

25:56.126 --> 25:58.427
I... You look...

25:59.063 --> 26:00.562
Wow.

26:00.631 --> 26:03.398
- You said you didn't get me anything.
- Yeah.

26:03.467 --> 26:05.267
Obviously I lied.

26:07.905 --> 26:10.138
- So you're leaving with Sebastian?
- Yes.

26:10.207 --> 26:13.608
- And before you say anything...
- He seems like a great guy.

26:13.677 --> 26:16.611
I tried to find some dirt
on him but I couldn't.

26:18.749 --> 26:21.049
- Are you excited?
- I am.

26:21.585 --> 26:23.518
Good. You should be.

26:25.055 --> 26:27.255
You deserve something that inspires you,
something that makes your heart race.

26:27.858 --> 26:29.891
I had that.

26:32.129 --> 26:34.162
I love you.

26:35.532 --> 26:37.099
What?

26:37.167 --> 26:39.034
I want to be with you
for the rest of time,

26:39.103 --> 26:42.004
and that's exactly what I
intend to do, because...

26:42.072 --> 26:46.174
happily ever after it's real.

26:49.380 --> 26:51.179
And we're gonna find it, together.

26:53.951 --> 26:55.984
So you think the fact that you love me,

26:56.053 --> 26:57.953
that's supposed to change things?

27:00.457 --> 27:01.990
Yeah.

27:02.059 --> 27:04.659
Do you realize that when I
told you that I love you,

27:04.728 --> 27:07.696
you told me you don't do relationships,
and you broke up with me?

27:07.765 --> 27:10.632
- You never said you loved me.
- On Christmas.

27:11.735 --> 27:13.535
In that letter.

27:15.005 --> 27:18.106
The most girly, vulnerable, stupid,
pathetic love letter I've ever written,

27:18.175 --> 27:21.343
and I must have checked that
library a thousand goddamn times,

27:21.412 --> 27:23.979
and every damn time I hated mys...

27:24.048 --> 27:25.947
Why are you smiling right now?

27:28.018 --> 27:31.153
Because you look like a princess,
but you don't sound like one.

27:31.455 --> 27:33.755
Uh...

27:33.824 --> 27:35.857
I never got that letter.

27:37.928 --> 27:40.829
If I... If I had, I never could've left.

27:40.898 --> 27:41.930
But you did.

27:43.067 --> 27:46.768
You could have been honest
with me, told me the truth,

27:46.837 --> 27:49.037
and we could have
worked it out together.

27:51.608 --> 27:55.377
And now I have a chance
to do something great...

27:55.446 --> 27:57.579
I'm not asking you to stay.

27:58.148 --> 28:01.149
I... I want you to stay,
or I want to go with you,

28:01.218 --> 28:03.552
but I want you to be exactly
who you want to be.

28:03.620 --> 28:07.122
And I know that being with
me's not easy, but you'd be...

28:07.191 --> 28:09.357
you'd be bored if it was too easy.

28:09.426 --> 28:12.661
No. I want easy. Okay?

28:12.729 --> 28:17.099
I want comfortable and I want calm.
And Sebastian is.

28:18.836 --> 28:21.002
But he's not the guy for you.

28:22.072 --> 28:24.106
I am.

28:24.942 --> 28:28.944
I came through the fire...

28:29.012 --> 28:31.113
and it was so hard...

28:32.049 --> 28:34.416
..'cause I was so in love with you.

28:37.421 --> 28:40.222
Jasper, I can't do it again.

28:41.825 --> 28:44.493
Prince Robert is sneaking out.

28:45.395 --> 28:47.362
Sorry.

28:51.335 --> 28:53.435
I know I hurt you.

28:55.506 --> 28:58.807
I'm not expecting you to just
run back into my arms, but...

29:01.278 --> 29:04.279
..if you leave this palace
behind, don't leave us behind.

29:06.583 --> 29:08.617
You're my girl, Princess.

29:10.020 --> 29:14.956
And I'm gonna love you...
no matter what.

29:41.518 --> 29:43.084
Hi.

29:43.453 --> 29:46.888
I'm sorry. It's been crazy,
and that's not fair.

29:47.958 --> 29:49.991
Liam said he spoke to you.

29:50.294 --> 29:52.594
Um, yeah.

29:53.163 --> 29:55.564
Angie texted him.

29:55.632 --> 29:57.832
- It's a long story.
- You can tell me later.

30:03.607 --> 30:05.440
I missed you.

30:30.167 --> 30:33.335
They've been gathering for
days, sleeping in the rain.

30:34.304 --> 30:38.206
I'm not sure I would do that if Jesus
Christ himself were making an appearance.

30:38.809 --> 30:40.642
I'm sorry about Jack.

30:42.412 --> 30:44.879
Yeah. I am too.

30:46.617 --> 30:49.284
I'm not attending the
Coronation tomorrow.

30:49.720 --> 30:51.419
I thought you should know.

30:51.488 --> 30:54.189
Liam, don't do this to me. For once,

30:54.258 --> 30:57.292
can't you please just fall in line
and honor your duty to this family?

30:57.361 --> 31:00.328
I've been honoring my duty to this
family since the day I was born.

31:00.397 --> 31:03.698
- So don't give me that shit.
- What is it this time?

31:03.767 --> 31:07.168
What travesty of justice precludes you

31:07.237 --> 31:11.373
from walking out of the palace and
simply standing for a few minutes?

31:12.142 --> 31:14.209
He could have helped us.

31:15.178 --> 31:17.212
He could have possibly saved Dad.

31:17.281 --> 31:21.883
From a deranged psychopath who lived
in the clock tower? Unlikely.

31:22.719 --> 31:25.654
Where's the shame in wanting
some solitude from all of this?

31:25.722 --> 31:27.422
You wouldn't blame your brother

31:27.491 --> 31:29.416
if you'd been brought up
with the same expectations

31:29.418 --> 31:30.059
I was.

31:30.127 --> 31:32.427
You were the spare.

31:32.496 --> 31:34.663
And then, for a few short
months, you weren't,

31:34.731 --> 31:36.264
and look what's become of you.

31:36.333 --> 31:39.601
Skulking around the palace,
peddling conspiracy theories.

31:39.670 --> 31:43.071
It's disgraceful, and I've had enough.
We all have.

31:44.675 --> 31:47.642
He's tricking you, Mum.
He's manipulating you,

31:47.711 --> 31:50.578
and you're either too
vain or stupid to notice.

31:50.647 --> 31:52.547
Oh, but you're not?

31:52.616 --> 31:56.318
We're all easily-duped idiots
and you're the enlightened one?

31:56.386 --> 32:01.289
As if! Pull your head out of your
arse, you selfish, bitter child.

32:01.358 --> 32:03.625
You're not the King. Get over it.

32:03.694 --> 32:06.561
- Your father would be appalled by you.
- Yeah?

32:06.630 --> 32:08.697
Maybe he wouldn't have
been out walking the city

32:08.765 --> 32:11.566
if his wife wasn't cheating
on him for the last 30 years.

32:18.675 --> 32:20.975
I hope you're right about Robert...

32:22.612 --> 32:26.414
..'cause he's the only son you're
gonna have when this is over.

32:48.105 --> 32:50.672
You got somewhere you need to be?

32:53.477 --> 32:56.711
When I was on the island, I saw you.

32:57.948 --> 33:00.482
You were wearing white,
like you are now.

33:01.551 --> 33:03.818
You whispered a question to me.

33:06.423 --> 33:09.090
You're the reason that I came back.

33:16.900 --> 33:20.101
It's gonna be difficult
never seeing you again.

33:21.938 --> 33:23.938
What?

33:41.684 --> 33:44.348
- Hi.
- Wow. You...

33:44.350 --> 33:46.516
You actually look kind of good.

33:46.646 --> 33:49.056
You actually look like a princess.
I like it.

33:49.058 --> 33:50.315
Thank you. You too.

33:53.887 --> 33:56.020
I know you're worried about leaving.

33:56.456 --> 34:00.124
And I know it likely has
everything to do with Jasper.

34:00.193 --> 34:03.661
But your entire life, you've been
asked to consider this family.

34:03.730 --> 34:05.296
Consider you this time.

34:05.365 --> 34:08.032
Not the monarchy, not
Jasper, not even me.

34:09.034 --> 34:11.636
Make it about you.

34:14.541 --> 34:16.007
It's time.

34:16.708 --> 34:18.443
It's time.

34:30.889 --> 34:33.056
You have done well, my son.

34:33.493 --> 34:36.928
You have absorbed everything
we've taught you.

34:36.996 --> 34:39.964
Your brother, on the other
hand, is all heart...

34:40.800 --> 34:42.400
..which isn't a terrible thing.

34:42.469 --> 34:44.802
He lacks discipline.

34:44.871 --> 34:47.938
But he makes up for it by
sheer will and determination.

34:48.007 --> 34:49.706
You could learn a lot from him.

34:50.076 --> 34:52.076
He could learn a lot from me.

34:52.145 --> 34:54.712
Your hubris, Robert,

34:56.382 --> 34:58.950
it will be your downfall one day.

35:02.255 --> 35:05.790
I have decided to disband
the monarchy, my son.

35:07.460 --> 35:09.293
It's not your fault.

35:09.362 --> 35:11.462
You've done nothing wrong.

35:12.198 --> 35:14.365
It's just who you are.

35:15.235 --> 35:17.969
What does that mean? It's who I am?

35:19.172 --> 35:22.039
You have all the gifts
that can be taught...

35:23.042 --> 35:25.109
..and none of the gifts that can't.

35:26.145 --> 35:29.247
And as much as I love you
and I do love you, my son

35:31.484 --> 35:33.651
you will never make a great king.

35:35.054 --> 35:36.988
And I'm sorry.

36:12.859 --> 36:14.759
Seems you won't be joining us.

36:14.827 --> 36:16.961
- That's a shame, brother.
- It is.

36:17.030 --> 36:19.964
- But you created this.
- No.

36:20.833 --> 36:22.533
You created this.

36:34.981 --> 36:37.582
I just found out King
Simon was my father.

36:38.885 --> 36:41.919
Everything is going to change for us.

36:56.469 --> 36:59.670
In a few moments, I'll be King...

36:59.739 --> 37:02.306
and you'll be who you've always been.

37:16.289 --> 37:19.023
Let him go. We don't need him.

37:19.092 --> 37:22.326
No Liam, no Cyrus, no Spencer...

37:23.096 --> 37:25.262
The first two had a choice.

37:25.331 --> 37:27.698
The Lord Chamberlain, I fired.

37:27.767 --> 37:29.934
What? Why? You had no right!

37:30.003 --> 37:33.170
I have every right. I'm
the King of England.

37:41.648 --> 37:43.648
Uh... I don't understand.

37:43.716 --> 37:45.783
I love you.

37:45.852 --> 37:48.486
There has to be a way that
we can make this work.

37:51.124 --> 37:53.324
There may have been a way.

37:55.461 --> 37:58.929
But that was lost the moment
you slept with my brother...

38:02.135 --> 38:04.902
..and every time you lied
about it to my face.

38:05.638 --> 38:07.638
You knew?

38:10.009 --> 38:12.943
But you kept... you kept seeing me.

38:13.012 --> 38:15.846
You kept saying that you cared about me.

38:15.915 --> 38:17.982
Yes, I did.

38:18.051 --> 38:20.284
Because, let's face it,

38:20.353 --> 38:22.453
you're quite the whore in bed.

38:24.157 --> 38:28.192
I think it's that common blood in
you, but you'll have to ask Liam.

40:23.009 --> 40:26.243
Mr. Frost. Is this Jasper's father?

40:27.647 --> 40:29.880
I have a proposition for you.

41:16.429 --> 41:18.495
What?

41:25.238 --> 41:27.338
I need your help.

41:27.406 --> 41:29.840
Long live the King!

41:29.909 --> 41:31.842
Long live the King!

41:32.011 --> 41:35.346
Long live the King! Long live the King!

41:35.414 --> 41:37.481
Come in.
