00:41.691 --> 00:47.129
Ladies and gentlemen, please rise for the
best 60 seconds in television history.

00:54.671 --> 00:57.406
Aaaaah!

01:26.669 --> 01:28.637
Aaaah!

01:47.223 --> 01:49.591
Okay, Lorraine, let's
meet your suitors.

01:49.626 --> 01:51.827
Bachelor number one
is a peeping tom.

01:51.861 --> 01:54.396
Bachelor number two is
an attempted rapist.

01:54.431 --> 01:57.466
And bachelor number
three is your own son.

01:57.500 --> 02:00.469
I'm becoming a nun.

02:00.503 --> 02:03.105
Hey, thanks for playing, Marty.

02:05.975 --> 02:08.210
My spider sense is
tingling, but why?!

02:08.244 --> 02:09.511
Is it the green goblin?!

02:10.547 --> 02:11.313
The lizard?!

02:12.082 --> 02:13.816
Aunt may having another stroke?!

02:16.519 --> 02:20.055
Nothing? Okay.

02:21.091 --> 02:23.459
Oh, the milk went bad.

02:23.493 --> 02:26.895
Um, thanks, spider sense?

02:27.931 --> 02:29.965
Uh-oh, spider sense tingling!

02:34.904 --> 02:37.439
Oh, no... Those kids!

02:38.475 --> 02:40.909
You tingled me over a puddle?!

02:46.116 --> 02:49.017
Face it, tiger...
You're gonna get laid.

02:49.052 --> 02:50.185
Yes!

02:50.220 --> 02:53.388
After tonight, the vulture can't
call me a virgin ever again!

02:54.157 --> 02:55.224
No, no! Shoo, shoo!

02:55.258 --> 02:57.860
Come on, let another part
of me tingle for once!

02:57.894 --> 03:00.362
Uh-oh!

03:04.200 --> 03:05.868
Be more specific!

03:05.902 --> 03:07.402
Of course I'm in danger!

03:07.437 --> 03:11.340
I'm hundreds of feet
above manhat... Ugh!

03:12.008 --> 03:12.541
Whatever.

03:12.575 --> 03:15.144
Well, Mr. Parker, it looks
like you broke your ankle.

03:15.178 --> 03:18.080
Also, x-rays show a tumor at the
base of your skull that is, for

03:18.114 --> 03:19.548
lack of a better word, tingling.

03:19.582 --> 03:20.883
Remove it. Remove it now.

03:22.919 --> 03:25.387
Time of death... 3:47 P.M.

03:30.493 --> 03:31.827
I'm gonna make it rain!

03:44.440 --> 03:48.043
So, I told the Oompa-Loompas,
"come live with me in peace and

03:48.077 --> 03:53.081
safety, away from all the Wangdoodles and
the Hornswogglers and Snozzwangers

03:53.116 --> 03:56.084
and rotten Vernicious knids."

04:00.623 --> 04:02.558
Aaaaaaah!

04:12.669 --> 04:14.903
And 5, 6, 7, 8!

04:14.938 --> 04:17.372
♪ Oompa-Loompa, doopity ♪

04:17.406 --> 04:18.406
Arms, people!

04:18.440 --> 04:21.410
It's all in the arms! Come on!

04:21.444 --> 04:23.111
♪ Oompa-Loompa ♪

04:23.146 --> 04:24.179
Hey, you... you there!

04:25.048 --> 04:25.781
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:25.815 --> 04:28.617
Is this dance too
challenging for you?

04:28.651 --> 04:29.785
Are you tired?

04:29.819 --> 04:31.987
You feeling faint?

04:32.722 --> 04:34.389
Why don't you just
take a load off, okay?

04:34.424 --> 04:35.958
Aaaah!

04:36.559 --> 04:38.260
All right, people,
here we go again.

04:38.294 --> 04:40.028
This time, with feeling!

04:40.063 --> 04:42.231
And 5, 6, 7, 8!

04:42.265 --> 04:43.565
Welcome back to "Unwrapped."

04:43.600 --> 04:46.168
You know, nearly everyone has
enjoyed an ice-cream sundae on a

04:46.202 --> 04:50.005
hot day, but the origins of this
tasty treat may just surprise you.

04:50.039 --> 04:53.408
It's commonly accepted that the
sundae was invented in Evanston,

04:53.443 --> 04:55.244
Illinois, circa 1890.

04:55.278 --> 04:58.247
We went to Dr. Peter Yarbourgh
for the real scoop.

04:58.281 --> 05:01.817
Here's how [bleep] dumb these
[bleep] heads in Illinois were.

05:01.851 --> 05:03.719
The ice-cream soda had
just been invented.

05:03.753 --> 05:04.653
Teenagers liked them.

05:04.687 --> 05:07.155
So, these [bleep] religious
numbnuts sat around jacking off

05:07.190 --> 05:09.591
in church all day, thinking
about how much they just hated

05:09.626 --> 05:13.562
teenagers and decided... true
[bleep] story, people... that

05:13.596 --> 05:15.731
God therefore must
hate ice-cream sodas.

05:15.765 --> 05:17.032
That's right!

05:17.066 --> 05:20.068
These Illinois [bleep] knobs
concluded that God, creator of

05:20.103 --> 05:23.005
the infinite universe who
probably had a trillion [bleep]

05:23.039 --> 05:26.441
better things to do, actually
had an opinion about mother

05:26.476 --> 05:28.577
[bleep] ice-cream sodas!

05:28.611 --> 05:31.847
So the state of Illinois banned
ice-cream sodas on Sundays, you

05:31.881 --> 05:34.916
know, I guess so God wouldn't
make it rain crickets or some

05:34.951 --> 05:36.285
ridiculous [bleep] horse [bleep]

05:36.319 --> 05:38.820
Long story short, every Sunday,
the [bleep] ice-cream stores,

05:38.855 --> 05:41.390
they'd just... ta da!... They'd just leave
out the soda part,

05:41.424 --> 05:43.859
and these Illinois [bleep] sat
around, jacked off, thinking

05:43.893 --> 05:46.361
about how much they had pleased
their invisible master, who

05:46.396 --> 05:49.197
lives on a [bleep] flying cloud
or wherever the [bleep] he lives!

05:49.232 --> 05:55.604
That's how ice-cream sundaes were invented...
dumb [bleep] Illinois assholes!

05:55.638 --> 05:57.639
Up next, Skittles.

05:57.674 --> 05:59.875
Oh [bleep] Skittles!

06:05.381 --> 06:07.282
Can't we try
missionary just once?

06:08.785 --> 06:11.653
Krabby patties are
made out of crabs!

06:15.558 --> 06:18.960
Everyone knows krabby patties are
me family's secret recipe, boy.

06:18.995 --> 06:21.096
Then explain this!

06:22.298 --> 06:27.936
You said you fired Carl, the night
janitor, but this is his tattoo!

06:27.970 --> 06:30.572
You little yellow bastard!

06:30.606 --> 06:32.774
I treated you like
a son, me boy!

06:32.809 --> 06:34.476
And it's not just crabs!

06:34.510 --> 06:38.246
Squidward, those calamari
rings are squid!

06:38.281 --> 06:41.917
And your chicken-of-the-sea
salad... ha!... Tuna!

06:41.951 --> 06:44.586
Chicken of the sea is tuna!

06:45.822 --> 06:46.888
You fed us to us!

06:46.923 --> 06:48.824
You let us pay you to kill us?!

06:48.858 --> 06:50.659
You're disgusting!

06:50.693 --> 06:51.159
No!

06:51.194 --> 06:53.362
I'm the last honest
man in bikini bottom!

06:53.396 --> 06:55.297
We're all animals,
boys and girls!

06:55.331 --> 06:57.566
Eating each other is
what nature intended!

07:01.170 --> 07:04.306
I'm just glad nothing
disgusting happens to a sponge.

07:04.340 --> 07:09.811
Okay, just got to scrub deep within
your rolls of fat, and we're done.

07:09.846 --> 07:14.549
I said nothing disgusting
ever happens to a sponge!

07:14.584 --> 07:16.651
Ugh, I hope that's
pudding in there.

07:16.686 --> 07:22.991
I sure was lucky to get a job after
my first two nights at the museums.

07:23.025 --> 07:26.395
Oh, hell, no!

07:26.429 --> 07:34.836
Today, I consider meself...The Lou
Gehrig-est man on the face of the earth.

07:40.276 --> 07:42.844
Well, if
it isn't this loser.

07:42.879 --> 07:43.445
Snarf, snarf!

07:43.479 --> 07:46.248
Oh, man, please don't
let this fool start talking to me.

07:46.282 --> 07:51.086
What are you hiding under that pointy
hat, feeb... he-man's spray tanner?

07:51.120 --> 07:51.920
Snarf, snarf!

07:51.954 --> 07:56.324
This pathetic jackass can't even go one
sentence without saying his own name.

07:56.359 --> 07:59.094
Nice bathrobe, douche!

07:59.128 --> 07:59.861
Snarf, snarf.

07:59.896 --> 08:02.431
What if I had a vocal
affectation that annoying?

08:02.465 --> 08:03.799
Hope it doesn't rain today.

08:03.833 --> 08:04.466
Orko, orko!

08:04.500 --> 08:06.001
Would you like fries with that?

08:06.035 --> 08:06.868
Orko, orko!

08:06.903 --> 08:08.703
I'd end up in a shallow grave.

08:08.738 --> 08:09.404
Asshole.

08:09.439 --> 08:10.138
Snarf.

08:11.407 --> 08:13.508
Oh, no!

08:13.543 --> 08:15.510
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

08:16.479 --> 08:17.712
Oh, okay.

08:17.747 --> 08:18.580
Snarf, snarf.

08:18.614 --> 08:21.316
Speak English, you half-wit!

08:21.350 --> 08:22.951
Snarf, snarf!

08:22.985 --> 08:24.553
Uh-huh, yeah.

08:24.587 --> 08:25.086
I see.

08:25.121 --> 08:27.556
Kill me, kill me, kill me.

08:31.928 --> 08:32.427
Oh, crap!

08:32.462 --> 08:34.563
Do not turn around, please,
you son of a bitch!

08:34.597 --> 08:35.630
Oh, no, do not turn around!

08:35.664 --> 08:36.498
Don't turn around!

08:36.532 --> 08:38.667
Gleek, it's me... Andy Richter!

08:38.701 --> 08:43.337
Oh, seeing you here reminds
me of a great Conan story.

08:50.746 --> 08:55.684
A wonderful day to make cookies...
cookies with the finest ingredients, the

08:55.718 --> 08:57.419
smoothest chocolate.

08:58.354 --> 09:00.789
Oh, that I lived
to see this day.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.400
Are you sure, Ernest?

09:12.435 --> 09:13.001
Yes.

09:13.035 --> 09:15.103
Listen to the voice
upon the wind.

09:15.137 --> 09:18.773
You will know it to be true.

09:18.808 --> 09:21.343
Cookie.

09:22.378 --> 09:24.946
Cookie!

09:25.982 --> 09:27.282
Cookie!

09:28.317 --> 09:30.452
Hold!

09:35.625 --> 09:37.425
Hold!

09:41.063 --> 09:43.665
Hold!

09:43.699 --> 09:44.699
I owed them overtime.

09:45.801 --> 09:50.272
Uh, b-b-b-but you owe <i>me</i>
<i>overtime, which is no big deal.</i>

09:53.609 --> 09:54.576
<i>Cookie!</i>

09:54.610 --> 09:55.677
<i>Cookie!</i>

09:55.711 --> 09:56.211
<i>Cookie!</i>

09:56.245 --> 09:57.712
<i>I didn't sign up for this!</i>

09:57.747 --> 09:59.281
<i>I just wanted to make cookies!</i>

09:59.315 --> 10:02.083
<i>I'm making cookies in
my pants right now!</i>

10:02.118 --> 10:03.752
<i>They're shaped like poo!</i>

10:03.786 --> 10:04.286
<i>Aah!</i>

10:04.320 --> 10:08.056
<i>Cookie!</i>

10:10.660 --> 10:12.093
<i>Agh! Unh!</i>

10:12.128 --> 10:13.828
<i>Ohh! Ohh!</i>

10:13.863 --> 10:15.564
<i>Aaaaah!</i>

10:15.598 --> 10:17.365
<i>Now give the monster
what he wants!</i>

10:17.400 --> 10:18.033
<i>Diabetes?</i>

10:18.067 --> 10:20.435
<i>Good comment on modern
culture, but no... cookies!</i>

10:22.071 --> 10:23.138
<i>Faster, buckets!</i>

10:23.172 --> 10:24.072
<i>Pack that fudge!</i>

10:24.106 --> 10:25.440
<i>Pack that fudge, damn it!</i>

10:26.342 --> 10:29.544
<i>Save your immaturity for when
we're not about to be killed,</i>

10:29.579 --> 10:31.379
<i>you idiot!</i>

10:31.414 --> 10:33.114
<i>Fudge.</i>

10:33.149 --> 10:37.686
<i>Cookie monster can't stop...
can't stop eating cookies!</i>

10:43.125 --> 10:45.560
<i>They didn't know he
have cookie addiction!</i>

10:45.595 --> 10:47.696
<i>It like they feed
heroin to junkie!</i>

10:47.730 --> 10:49.197
<i>It was a home invasion!</i>

10:49.231 --> 10:50.732
<i>They acted in self-defense!</i>

10:50.766 --> 10:52.133
<i>Order, please! Order!</i>

10:52.168 --> 10:55.103
<i>The court finds in favor
of Keebler incorporated!</i>

10:55.137 --> 10:57.872
<i>I guess that's the way
the cookie crumbles.</i>

10:57.907 --> 11:00.809
<i>Me son is dead and you make pun?!</i>

11:00.843 --> 11:01.910
