08:07.621 --> 08:09.557
AND THAT'S THE TRUTH.

08:09.657 --> 08:13.594
- WE BURNED HIM

08:13.694 --> 08:15.495
WITH THE CHOLERA VICTIMS.

08:15.596 --> 08:17.698
- I DON'T KNOW THAT.

08:17.798 --> 08:19.132
- WELL, I'M TELLING YOU.

08:19.232 --> 08:20.901
- DON'T.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.971

IF I DON'T KNOW IT.

08:24.071 --> 08:27.240
[knock at door]

08:27.340 --> 08:30.510

08:41.722 --> 08:45.225
NICE, UH, SUITE

08:50.731 --> 08:52.766
WHY DID SENATOR METCALF
STAY BEHIND

08:52.866 --> 08:56.970
WHEN GENERAL GRANT, OAKES AMES,
AND THE BOARD LEFT?

08:57.070 --> 09:00.073
- HE DIDN'T STAY HERE.
- DESK CLERK SAID HE DID.

09:00.173 --> 09:02.309
- WELL, PERHAPS
FOR A DAY OR TWO.

09:02.409 --> 09:04.612
- DID HE SAY
WHERE HE WAS GOING?

09:04.712 --> 09:05.746
- OH, HE WOULD HAVE
NO REASON

09:05.846 --> 09:08.816
TO TELL ME
HIS TRAVEL PLANS.

09:10.818 --> 09:13.153
- HIS WIFE SAYS
YOU ARE CHILDHOOD FRIENDS.

09:13.253 --> 09:16.089
- PERHAPS YES.

09:16.189 --> 09:18.291
BUT WE HAD...
[laughs]

WE HAD
VERY DIFFERENT CHILDHOODS.

09:37.811 --> 09:40.347
IT FELL
AGAINST THE WALL.

10:04.171 --> 10:07.875
- WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW THE SENATOR?

10:07.975 --> 10:10.644
- WITH, UH,
SO MANY HOTEL GUESTS,

10:10.744 --> 10:13.613
I'M SURE
HE CAN'T REMEMBER.

10:15.683 --> 10:18.351
- CAN'T SAY
I DO REMEMBER.

10:32.432 --> 10:34.334
- GOOD DAY, GENTLEMEN.

10:39.406 --> 10:41.274
[door closes]

10:41.374 --> 10:44.111
- AND THAT'S
HOW IT'S DONE.

10:52.252 --> 10:54.387
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

10:54.487 --> 10:56.256
- I'M GETTING
THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

10:56.356 --> 10:59.793
- LET'S NOT APPEAR
TO BE FEARFUL.

11:16.977 --> 11:19.713
- I'LL ONLY BE GONE A FEW DAYS.
HE GONNA BE ANY TROUBLE?

11:19.813 --> 11:20.914
- WELL, HE WON'T BATHE.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.682
AND WHILE YOU WERE
IN CHEYENNE,

11:22.783 --> 11:27.087
HE PULLED THAT KNIFE WHEN
I ASKED HIM TO SWEEP THE CHURCH.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.321
- BOY,
DON'T YOU KNOW BETTER

11:28.421 --> 11:29.790
THAN TO PULL A KNIFE
ON A CHURCH LADY?

11:29.890 --> 11:31.792
- YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HURT HIM,
ARE YOU?

11:31.892 --> 11:34.061
- HE AIN'T MINE TO WHUP.

11:34.161 --> 11:36.964
GET YOUR GEAR, BOY.
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.

11:37.064 --> 11:38.899
HE MIGHT'VE FALLEN OFF
A MORMON WAGON.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.400
MAYBE SOMEBODY AT THE FORT
WILL WANT HIM.

11:40.500 --> 11:43.236
- WILL HE BE SAFE
TRAVELING THAT FAR?

11:43.336 --> 11:44.471
- SAFE AS ME, I RECKON.

11:44.571 --> 11:46.840
YOU GET FRISKY
WITH THAT KNIFE AGAIN,

11:46.940 --> 11:49.076
I'M GONNA LEAVE YOU
TO THE INDIANS.

11:49.176 --> 11:51.812
- HE DOESN'T THINK
YOU REALLY WILL.

11:51.912 --> 11:54.815
- HE DON'T KNOW ME SO WELL.
COME ON.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.788
- I HAVE RECONSIDERED
YOUR REQUEST

12:00.888 --> 12:04.758
TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE MORMONS
ON YOUR BEHALF.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.794
- SOMEBODY SMOKED
YOUR TREE.

12:06.894 --> 12:08.728
NOW YOU OUT ON A LIMB?

12:08.829 --> 12:10.397
- COLORFUL, MR. BOHANNON,
BUT NO.

12:10.497 --> 12:12.465
I ASSURE YOU
I AM ACTING WITHOUT DURESS.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.968
- MIGHT BE TROUBLE UP AHEAD
WHERE IT IS I'M GOING.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.436
DON'T NEED IT
FOLLOWING ME TOO.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.305
NOW, THERE'S ONE YOU WANNA KEEP
YOUR KNIFE HANDY FOR.

12:18.405 --> 12:23.276
YOU GOT ME?
ALL RIGHT.

12:23.376 --> 12:26.980
LET'S RIDE.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.453
COME ON.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.994
- RIGHT THERE.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.864
SEE THE WAY THAT HAWK
DROPPED SOMETHING ON THE RISE?

12:43.964 --> 12:45.132
PROBABLY SNATCHED UP
HIS LUNCH

12:45.232 --> 12:48.201
AFORE HE REALIZED
IT WAS A RATTLESNAKE.

12:53.540 --> 12:55.876
WHY YOU KEEP
LOOKING BACK, DOC?

12:55.976 --> 12:59.212
- WE'RE IN MORMON COUNTRY NOW.

12:59.312 --> 13:00.914
- THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WAS FRIENDLY WITH MORMONS.

13:01.014 --> 13:04.985
- I'VE HAD MY DEALINGS
WITH THEM, YES.

13:05.085 --> 13:08.055
- THAT DON'T
COMFORT ME NONE.

13:10.590 --> 13:13.560
- WHO IS THAT BOY?

13:13.660 --> 13:15.295
- JUST A MUTE BOY.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.430
PROBABLY FELL OFF
ONE OF THE MORMON WAGON TRAINS.

13:17.530 --> 13:18.899
HAPPENS SOMETIMES.

13:18.999 --> 13:22.569
- SO YOU'VE ADOPTED HIM
AS YOUR PET, HMM?

13:22.669 --> 13:25.305
- THOUGHT I'D TRADE IN
MY WALKING BOSSES FOR HIM.

13:25.405 --> 13:28.575
- OH, AND WHAT ARE YOU
PLANNING TO OFFER THE MORMONS

13:28.675 --> 13:30.577
IN EXCHANGE
FOR YOUR MEN?

13:30.677 --> 13:34.982
- OPEN PASSAGE WEST ON THE U.P.
FOR THEIR SETTLERS.

13:35.082 --> 13:38.585
- FREE RAIL TICKETS.
HMM, YOU ARE DESPERATE.

13:38.685 --> 13:40.287
- WHY THE HELL ELSE
WOULD I BRING YOU?

13:40.387 --> 13:42.822
- [chuckles]

14:01.909 --> 14:04.377
- YOU THE SHERIFF HERE?

14:08.681 --> 14:10.951
- CHIEF OF RAILROAD POLICE.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.555
WHAT?

14:15.655 --> 14:17.357
- OH, NOTHING.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.626
JUST DIDN'T FIGURE ON
THE CHIEF OF POLICE TO BE SO--

14:19.726 --> 14:21.494
- BLACK.

14:21.594 --> 14:23.296
- DRUNK.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.869
- AIN'T A CRIME OUT HERE.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.972
- DETECTIVE MALONE.

14:32.072 --> 14:34.074
BOSTON POLICE.

14:34.174 --> 14:36.910
GOT A MINUTE?

14:37.010 --> 14:39.913
JUST A FEW QUESTIONS.

14:40.013 --> 14:44.551
- [breathing shakily]

14:44.651 --> 14:46.386
WE GOT TROUBLE, MICKEY.
- NOT ME.

14:46.486 --> 14:48.888
- COPPER'S ASKING QUESTIONS
ABOUT METCALF,

14:48.989 --> 14:52.993
AND DURANT MADE ME LOOK--
- WHAT?

14:53.093 --> 14:54.962
- HE MADE ME LOOK GUILTY.

14:55.062 --> 14:57.330
- I WARNED YOU ABOUT DURANT.
- I KNOW.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.332
AND YOU WERE RIGHT.

14:59.432 --> 15:03.370
- THIS COPPER
IS FROM BOSTON, SEAN.

15:03.470 --> 15:06.106
- MICKEY, WHAT ARE
WE GONNA DO?

15:06.206 --> 15:08.141
- YOU'RE GONNA GET AS FAR AWAY
FROM ME AS YOU CAN

15:08.241 --> 15:11.945
'CAUSE ALL YOU EVER DO
IS BRING TROUBLE.

15:12.045 --> 15:14.014
SO GO, BE GONE.

15:14.114 --> 15:16.383
I DON'T KNOW YOU.

15:23.623 --> 15:27.127
WHY DON'T YOU DO US ALL
A FAVOR, SEAN?

15:27.227 --> 15:29.496
DISAPPEAR.

15:29.596 --> 15:32.532
JUST POOF, THIN AIR.

15:32.632 --> 15:35.668
DON'T EVEN LEAVE A STINK.

15:38.571 --> 15:40.573
- ALL RIGHT.

15:40.673 --> 15:41.674
FADE INTO THESE COTTONWOODS.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.443
YOU HEAR ANY GUNFIRE,

15:43.543 --> 15:46.679
YOU HIGHTAIL IT BACK
TO THE RAILROAD, YOU HEAR ME?

16:14.207 --> 16:16.109
- [in Mandarin accent]
GENTLEMEN!

16:16.209 --> 16:18.211
- COLLIS HUNTINGTON.

16:18.311 --> 16:19.179
- IF YOU'RE HERE
AFTER YOUR DESERTED WORKERS,

16:19.279 --> 16:20.680
YOU'RE TOO LATE.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.749
THEY AND THE MORMONS
ARE ALREADY IN MY EMPLOY.

16:22.849 --> 16:24.484
- THEMS IS MY MEN.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.653
- MAY I SUGGEST WE CAMP
IN YONDER MEADOW

16:26.753 --> 16:29.622
OUT OF RIFLE SHOT
OF THAT GLOOMY PLACE?

16:29.722 --> 16:30.990
MR. SCOGGINS.

16:31.091 --> 16:33.026
[speaking Mandarin]

16:33.126 --> 16:36.496
- [speaking Mandarin]

16:36.596 --> 16:38.698
- WE'LL CAMP FOR DINNER.

16:38.798 --> 16:41.701
[rings bell]

16:57.650 --> 17:00.153
- I AIN'T GOT TIME
TO BE LOLLYGAGGING AROUND HERE.

17:00.253 --> 17:04.657
- THIS IS A FORTUITOUS TURN
FOR BOTH OF US.

17:04.757 --> 17:07.760
WHO WOULD YOU RATHER DEAL WITH,
HUNTINGTON OR THE MORMONS?

17:09.562 --> 17:11.131
JUST BEHAVE YOURSELF
AT DINNER,

17:11.231 --> 17:14.167
AND LET ME DO THE TALKING.

17:28.181 --> 17:30.483
- MR. BOHANNON,
MY SPIES TELL ME

17:30.583 --> 17:33.120
THAT YOUR RAILROAD
IS FALTERING.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.421
- WE HAD SOME SETBACKS--

17:34.521 --> 17:37.056
WEATHER AND INDIANS
AND RUSTLERS.

17:37.157 --> 17:39.159
CHOLERA HIT US HARD.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.428
SOME OF MY MEN WENT OVER THERE
JUST FOR FOOD AND WATER.

17:41.528 --> 17:43.830
- THIS IS MORMON TERRITORY,
GENTLEMEN.

17:43.930 --> 17:45.732
THEY ARE FASTIDIOUS
ABOUT INTERLOPERS,

17:45.832 --> 17:47.567
ESPECIALLY NEGROES
AND THE ORIENTAL.

17:47.667 --> 17:50.770
MY DEAL WITH BRIGHAM YOUNG
FORBIDS CHINESE LABOR.

17:50.870 --> 17:52.439
I'M GONNA NEED MEN
TO BUILD THROUGH HERE.

17:52.539 --> 17:54.341
- IT'S A LONG WALK BACK
FOR YOUR CHINAMEN.

17:54.441 --> 17:55.708
- THEIR COUNTRY
HAS BEEN DECIMATED.

17:55.808 --> 17:59.146
HUMAN MEAT HANGS IN THE MARKETS
AT NANJING.

17:59.246 --> 18:02.682
MY WORKERS
WILL SETTLE IN CALIFORNIA.

18:02.782 --> 18:05.318
BY THE TURN OF THE CENTURY,
I PREDICT MANDARIN

18:05.418 --> 18:08.188
WILL BE
THE STATE'S SECOND LANGUAGE.

18:08.288 --> 18:11.724
THANK YOU, MR. SCOGGINS.

18:11.824 --> 18:14.794
- I, UM--
I HIRED SOME MORMONS

18:14.894 --> 18:17.230
FOR SOME OF MY EARLY SURVEYS,

18:17.330 --> 18:18.731
SUMMER OF '61.

18:18.831 --> 18:21.634
- YEAH, AND IT COST ME
$1/4 MILLION LAST WEEK

18:21.734 --> 18:24.103
TO REGAIN BRIGHAM YOUNG'S
CONFIDENCE IN RAILROAD MEN.

18:24.204 --> 18:26.339
- [laughs]
I HAD TO PAY THAT AND SOME

18:26.439 --> 18:28.375
TO GET RELIABLE MAPS
OF THIS REGION

18:28.475 --> 18:31.844
TO REPLACE THE WORTHLESS CHARTS
THEY'D SUPPLIED ME.

18:31.944 --> 18:35.182
- HORSESHIT.
YOU CHOSE TO CHEAT 'EM.

18:35.282 --> 18:36.883
REGARDLESS, YOU'RE THROUGH
IN THE WEST, THOMAS.

18:36.983 --> 18:39.352
- YOU KNOW,
I REPLACE HIM

18:39.452 --> 18:41.621
WHEN HE FAILS
TO MAKE HIS DEADLINE.

18:41.721 --> 18:44.624
- IS THAT SO?

18:44.724 --> 18:46.893
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
I'LL MAKE IT SIMPLE FOR YOU.

18:46.993 --> 18:50.230
YOU GIVE ME THE MEN
YOU MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR TODAY,

18:50.330 --> 18:53.766
AND I'LL GIVE YOU BOHANNON.

18:53.866 --> 18:55.668
- I AIN'T YOURS TO GIVE.

18:55.768 --> 18:57.704
- I KNOW
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.639
IT'S CERTAINLY
WHAT I WANT.

18:59.739 --> 19:01.741
AND DO EITHER OF US REALLY
GIVE A DAMN WHAT HE WANTS?

19:01.841 --> 19:04.244
- IS THAT HOW YOU NEGOTIATE?
I KNEW THIS WAS A WASTE OF TIME.

19:04.344 --> 19:05.745
THANK YOU FOR THE SUPPER.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.647
- MR. BOHANNON, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA GET YOUR MEN BACK,

19:07.747 --> 19:11.484
BUT I CAN OFFER YOU
SOMETHING BETTER.

19:22.495 --> 19:23.363
- THIS IS
WHAT I CAN SAVE YOU.

19:23.463 --> 19:24.731
- EVA, I CAN'T HIRE YOU.

19:24.831 --> 19:25.798
- I CAN SLEEP
UNDER THE WHISKEY WAGON.

19:25.898 --> 19:26.799
THAT'S NO PROBLEM, OKAY?

19:26.899 --> 19:28.668
I CAN EAT SCRAPPINGS.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.703
I'M WORTH SOMETHING, MICKEY.
LOOK AT WHAT I'M WORTH.

19:30.803 --> 19:32.405
- EVA, I KNOW
YOU'RE WORTH SOMETHING.

19:32.505 --> 19:35.342
BUT I CAN'T AFFORD TROUBLE
WITH YOUR MR. FERGUSON.

19:35.442 --> 19:37.544
- THIS AIN'T GOT NOTHING
TO DO WITH HIM.

19:37.644 --> 19:39.812
- IT'S GOT EVERYTHING
TO DO WITH HIM.

19:39.912 --> 19:42.682
HE'S OUT THERE RIGHT NOW.
HE'S ANGRY, HE'S DRUNK.

19:42.782 --> 19:44.183
AND I'M SPEAKING WITH THE WOMAN
WHO MADE HIM THAT WAY,

19:44.284 --> 19:47.920
WHO BROKE HIS HEART.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.290
I'M SORRY.

19:50.390 --> 19:52.825
EVA, I CAN'T.

19:52.925 --> 19:54.927
[sighs]

19:57.730 --> 20:00.367
TAKE THIS MONEY.

20:02.269 --> 20:03.303
HOP THE NEXT TRAIN.

20:03.403 --> 20:05.705
YOU'RE ALREADY PACKED.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.674
PLEASE.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.909
FOR BOTH OUR SAKES,
DON'T LOOK BACK.

20:10.009 --> 20:12.879
[soft music]

20:12.979 --> 20:20.987
*

20:26.826 --> 20:30.430
MR. FERGUSON.
[clears throat]

20:30.530 --> 20:33.666
BUY YOU A DRINK.

20:41.774 --> 20:44.811
- THE TRAIN THAT'S COMING
AIN'T LEAVING TILL TOMORROW.

20:46.846 --> 20:49.716
- [sighs]

20:49.816 --> 20:51.017
THANK YOU.

20:51.117 --> 20:53.286
RIGHT.

20:54.987 --> 20:56.389
- YOU LOOK LIKE A MAN
WITH A PROBLEM

20:56.489 --> 20:59.692
THAT LEAVING TOWN'S
GONNA FIX.

21:03.863 --> 21:07.900
- YOU'RE WAITING
ON TOMORROW'S TRAIN?

21:08.000 --> 21:10.370
- NOWHERES TO GO.

21:10.470 --> 21:14.006
NOTHING WHEN I GET THERE.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.475
YOU?

21:15.575 --> 21:18.044
- [sighs]

21:18.144 --> 21:19.846
[train whistle blows]

21:21.948 --> 21:24.951
[sighs]

21:25.051 --> 21:27.387
NOWHERE
AND NOTHING AT ALL.

21:27.487 --> 21:28.888
[bell clangs]

21:33.526 --> 21:37.530
[train conductor shouts
in distance]

21:37.630 --> 21:39.332
- HELLO.

21:39.432 --> 21:43.035
I NEED YOU TO SEND A WIRE
TO THE BOSTON POLICE DEPARTMENT.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.805
SUSPECT BY THE NAME
OF SEAN MCGINNES.

21:45.905 --> 21:48.074
S-E-A-N

21:48.174 --> 21:51.811
M-C-G-I-N-N-E-S.

21:51.911 --> 21:54.013
AND HAVE 'EM GET BACK TO ME
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

21:54.113 --> 21:57.550
- YES, SIR.

22:00.086 --> 22:01.554
- THANK YOU.

22:01.654 --> 22:04.557
EVA.

22:05.892 --> 22:07.360
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU
AND THE BABY

22:07.460 --> 22:10.763
WHEN I GOT WORD
OF THE CHOLERA.

22:13.433 --> 22:16.903
OH, GOD.

22:17.003 --> 22:18.871
EVA, I'M SO SORRY.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.109
[sighs]
ALL RIGHT.

22:23.209 --> 22:25.044
COME ON.

22:25.144 --> 22:27.346
COME ON.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.867
- IT'S FOR THE BOY.

22:47.967 --> 22:51.738
CHINESE CANDY.
- HE'S ALREADY ASLEEP.

22:51.838 --> 22:53.740
THOUGHT YOU ONLY
SPOKE CHINAMAN.

22:53.840 --> 22:57.109
- I AM CHINESE,
BORN AND RAISED IN PEKING.

22:57.209 --> 22:59.446
- HMM.

23:07.620 --> 23:11.057
- YOU HUNG A MORMON BOY,
I HEARD.

23:13.159 --> 23:15.027
- PRETTY SURE HIS FATHER
KILLED MY CHIEF OF POLICE

23:15.127 --> 23:16.663
AND BLAMED HIS SON.

23:16.763 --> 23:19.031
- THAT'S NOT
HOW THEY'RE TELLING IT.

23:19.131 --> 23:20.567
- BET NOT.

23:20.667 --> 23:22.602
- THANK YOU,
MR. SCOGGINS.

23:32.044 --> 23:33.946
BRANDY.

23:45.525 --> 23:48.060
THESE MORMONS
FOUGHT OUR GOVERNMENT

23:48.160 --> 23:50.897
ACROSS MISSOURI AND ILLINOIS
INTO UTAH.

23:50.997 --> 23:53.466
MASSACRES HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED
TO THEIR MILITIAS.

23:53.566 --> 23:56.102
BRIGHAM YOUNG HAS VOWED
TO AVENGE

23:56.202 --> 23:58.605
THE BLOOD OF HIS PROPHETS
ON ANYONE WHO CROSSES THEM.

23:58.705 --> 24:00.940
THAT WOULD INCLUDE YOU

24:01.040 --> 24:05.211
IF THEY WERE TO CATCH YOU
OVER THERE, SON.

24:05.311 --> 24:07.980
- I NEED THEM MEN.

24:08.080 --> 24:11.951
- I'M CURIOUS
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA OFFER 'EM.

24:12.051 --> 24:15.021
- SMOKING MY PIPE
TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

24:15.121 --> 24:16.523
[clears throat]

24:16.623 --> 24:21.093
- WHAT IS IT YOU WANT
OUT OF ALL THIS?

24:21.193 --> 24:24.230
- I AIN'T PUT
TOO MUCH THOUGHT INTO IT.

24:24.330 --> 24:26.633
- LET ME TELL YOU.

24:26.733 --> 24:29.001
A BIG HOUSE
ON THE BEACH,

24:29.101 --> 24:30.937
A BEAUTIFUL WIFE,

24:31.037 --> 24:34.073
A LITTLE BOY PLAYING
WITH A BUCKET IN THE SAND.

24:34.173 --> 24:37.043
YOU TELL ME I'M WRONG.

24:39.178 --> 24:42.114
- [sighs]

24:42.214 --> 24:43.550
I GUESS
MAYBE DURANT'S RIGHT.

24:43.650 --> 24:44.617
SOME MEN ARE ARCHITECTS,

24:44.717 --> 24:47.620
AND OTHERS, JUST BUILDERS.

24:47.720 --> 24:49.255
I DON'T MIND IT
LIKE THAT.

24:49.355 --> 24:51.624
- THE OFFER STILL STANDS

24:51.724 --> 24:54.026
TO BUILD EAST WITH ME.

24:54.126 --> 24:55.962
- APPRECIATE IT.

24:57.730 --> 25:00.199
I'M HEADING WEST
WITH THE U.P.

25:00.299 --> 25:03.502
- GOOD NIGHT THEN.

25:03.603 --> 25:07.239
- I'LL SEE YOUR PACIFIC ONE DAY,
MR. HUNTINGTON.

25:07.339 --> 25:09.542
- YES, YOU WILL,
MR. BOHANNON,

25:09.642 --> 25:12.078
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

25:16.015 --> 25:19.185
- DID YOU REALLY HANG
A BOY?

25:21.754 --> 25:24.156
- I KNEW YOU COULD TALK
ALL ALONG.

25:26.058 --> 25:27.159
- DID YOU?

25:27.259 --> 25:29.161
- NO.

25:30.597 --> 25:32.632
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

25:32.732 --> 25:34.867
- EZRA.
- EZRA.

25:38.304 --> 25:40.306
EZRA.

25:41.641 --> 25:43.676
[sighs]

25:48.147 --> 25:50.783
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

25:58.224 --> 26:00.627
YEAH.

26:02.228 --> 26:05.564
I UNDERSTAND.

26:05.665 --> 26:08.868
LET'S GET SOME REST.

26:08.968 --> 26:11.237
TOMORROW, YOU'RE GONNA
HELP ME OUTSMART

26:11.337 --> 26:13.239
TWO OF THE SMARTEST MEN
IN THE WORLD.

26:13.339 --> 26:14.841
[grunts]

26:14.941 --> 26:16.042
THEY DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW

26:16.142 --> 26:17.810
ABOUT MEN
LIKE YOU AND ME.

26:17.910 --> 26:20.346
AND THAT'S A LOT.

26:29.221 --> 26:31.323
MM.

26:34.360 --> 26:37.664
YEAH, I HEAR YA.

26:40.232 --> 26:42.368
[sighs]

26:45.237 --> 26:47.106
[sighs]

26:54.446 --> 26:57.650
- [sighs]

27:09.261 --> 27:11.130
- [sighs]

27:31.884 --> 27:34.353
- PSALMS, WAKE UP.
- [groans]

27:34.453 --> 27:35.788
OH, BROTHER, TURN YOUR HEAD.
SOMETHING DIED IN YOUR MOUTH.

27:35.888 --> 27:37.423
- GET UP.
NOW GET UP.

27:37.523 --> 27:39.158
GET YOUR PANTS ON.
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

27:39.258 --> 27:40.860
- WE GOTTA GO.
- SOMETHING BURNING?

27:40.960 --> 27:42.695
- WE GOTTA GO TO NEW YORK,
GET ON THE FIRST TRAIN OUT.

27:42.795 --> 27:44.163
- GET AWAY FROM HERE.

27:44.263 --> 27:45.765
- WE GOING TO NEW YORK.
GET YOUR PANTS ON.

27:45.865 --> 27:48.267
- WE AIN'T GOING
TO NO DAMN NEW YORK.

27:48.367 --> 27:49.736
- WE GOT TO.
- WHAT?

27:49.836 --> 27:51.070
- MY BABY GIRL THERE.
WE GOTTA FIND HER.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.739
- YOU AIN'T GETTING
THAT BABY BACK.

27:52.839 --> 27:54.673
- WE CAN FIND HER.
- WHAT? WE CAN'T FIND HER.

27:54.774 --> 27:56.375
- I NEED YOU.
- LOOK, YOUR BABY GONE.

27:56.475 --> 27:58.244
YOU HEAR ME?

27:58.344 --> 28:02.048
YOU LISTEN.
LOOK, SHE GONE.

28:02.148 --> 28:04.917
AND YOU AIN'T
GETTING HER BACK.

28:05.017 --> 28:06.418
HMM?

28:06.518 --> 28:09.889
NOW YOU THINK ON--
YOU THINK ON THIS NOW.

28:09.989 --> 28:12.458
DONE BEEN
THROUGH TOO MUCH.

28:12.558 --> 28:14.794
DONE COME TOO FAR.

28:14.894 --> 28:17.196
AND DEEP DOWN,

28:17.296 --> 28:19.398
SHE WASN'T YOURS.

28:19.498 --> 28:22.301
YOU KNOW IT.

28:22.401 --> 28:24.470
HMM?

28:24.570 --> 28:26.705
FIND YOU A BUNK.

28:26.806 --> 28:29.876
YOU SLEEP THIS OFF.

28:29.976 --> 28:32.879
WAKE UP THE MAN
I KNOW YOU TO BE.

28:40.386 --> 28:43.722
- I MISS MY BABY GIRL.

28:43.823 --> 28:45.858
I MISS MY BABY GIRL.

28:47.559 --> 28:50.797
- BROTHER,

28:50.897 --> 28:52.999
SHE GONE.

29:00.239 --> 29:02.174
[man coughing]

29:02.274 --> 29:08.180
[indistinct chatter]

29:13.953 --> 29:16.088
[man coughs]

29:24.096 --> 29:27.499
- HOW YOU DOING, DUTCH?
- AWFUL, MR. BOHANNON.

29:30.302 --> 29:31.971
THEY BEEN WORKING US
NEAR TO DEATH,

29:32.071 --> 29:33.405
FEEDING US HARDTACK
AND WATER,

29:33.505 --> 29:34.874
PRAYING AND CHURCHING,
WE AIN'T GOOD ENOUGH

29:34.974 --> 29:36.175
TO GO INSIDE
OUT OF THE WEATHER.

29:36.275 --> 29:38.144
- GLAD YOU RUN OFF
FROM MY RAILROAD NOW?

29:38.244 --> 29:39.411
- WELL, RECKON IT'S BETTER
THAN CHOLERA.

29:39.511 --> 29:41.347
BUT HELL,
THEY PROMISED US WOMEN.

29:41.447 --> 29:42.648
AIN'T NONE.

29:42.681 --> 29:44.483
NO WHISKEY, NOT EVEN NO COFFEE.
WHAT KIND OF FOLKS IS THAT?

29:44.516 --> 29:46.018
- I CAN'T BE SEEN TALKING
TO YOU,

29:46.118 --> 29:47.954
BUT I NEED YOU BACK,
ALL RIGHT?

29:48.054 --> 29:51.790
- RUMOR IS THEY'LL SHOOT US
IF WE TRY TO RUN AWAY.

29:51.891 --> 29:55.327
I AIN'T SEEN IT YET,
BUT JUST LOOK YONDER.

29:56.428 --> 29:57.429
- YEAH.

29:57.529 --> 30:00.532
YEAH.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.301
IT'S ABOUT TO GET
A WHOLE LOT WORSE.

30:02.401 --> 30:05.304
ALL KINDS OF SHIT'S
ABOUT TO GET HEAPED ON YOU, SON.

30:05.404 --> 30:06.839
- YOU THERE!

30:06.939 --> 30:08.507
WHAT'S YOUR BUSINESS?

30:08.607 --> 30:11.243
[guns cock]

30:12.879 --> 30:17.316
- OH, I FOUND THIS MUTE BOY
OUT ON THE PRAIRIE.

30:17.416 --> 30:19.919
TRYING TO GET RID OF HIM.
HE ONE OF YOURS?

30:20.019 --> 30:21.387
- HAS HE PAPERS?
- NO.

30:21.487 --> 30:22.588
MOSTLY HE'S GOT FLEAS
AND RICKETS.

30:22.688 --> 30:24.190
YOU WANT HIM?

30:24.290 --> 30:27.927
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME,
STRANGER?

30:28.027 --> 30:31.330
- THIS AIN'T ABOUT ME.
IT'S ABOUT THE BOY.

30:31.430 --> 30:33.565
- YEAH, WELL, THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT YOU I DON'T LIKE.

30:33.665 --> 30:35.501
- HELL, THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT ME

30:35.601 --> 30:38.971
A LOT OF PEOPLE
DON'T LIKE.

30:39.071 --> 30:41.607
- YAH! YAH! YAH! YAH!

30:41.707 --> 30:42.875
- WAIT, HOLD, HOLD.

30:42.975 --> 30:44.576
DAMN IT, BOY.

30:44.676 --> 30:46.545
DIDN'T I TELL YOU NOT TO PULL
THAT KNIFE ON CHURCH FOLK?

30:46.645 --> 30:48.047
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

30:48.147 --> 30:51.383
JUST BE ON OUR WAY.
GOOD DAY TO YOU.

30:55.354 --> 30:57.089
COME ON, DUTCH.
BE BRAVE.

30:57.189 --> 30:58.624
THEY CAN'T SHOOT ALL OF YOU
AT ONCE.

30:58.724 --> 31:00.426
IF THEY DON'T SHOOT ME
IN THE BACK,

31:00.526 --> 31:03.930
BE WAITING FOR YOU
IN THE TREE LINE.

31:23.582 --> 31:25.884
- [sighs]

31:25.985 --> 31:29.989
I CAN'T LIVE
LIKE THIS ANYMORE.

31:30.089 --> 31:33.559
MALONE SENT A TELEGRAM
TO BOSTON ABOUT ME.

31:35.561 --> 31:38.564
I'VE BEEN RUNNING
MY WHOLE LIFE, MICKEY.

31:41.367 --> 31:43.669
I DON'T WANNA
DO IT ANYMORE.

31:43.769 --> 31:47.073
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, SEAN?

31:48.540 --> 31:52.678
- I'M GONNA DO
WHAT'S RIGHT.

31:52.778 --> 31:54.480
I'M GONNA CONFESS MYSELF

31:54.580 --> 31:58.050
TO RUTH IN THE CHURCH

31:58.150 --> 32:01.988
AND THEN TURN MYSELF IN
TO POLICE FOR ALL I'VE DONE.

32:12.431 --> 32:14.566
- YOU TURN YOURSELF IN
FOR WHAT YOU DONE,

32:14.666 --> 32:18.570
AND YOU'RE TURNING ME IN
FOR WHAT WE DONE.

32:18.670 --> 32:21.507
- I DON'T CARE.

32:21.607 --> 32:24.710
YOU'VE DENIED ME TOO.

32:24.810 --> 32:27.946
YOU'RE AS DEAD TO ME
AS I AM TO YOU.

32:34.586 --> 32:37.523
- YOU'LL HANG, SEAN.

32:39.025 --> 32:41.360
- I DON'T CARE ANYMORE.

32:41.460 --> 32:44.396
AT LEAST THIS WAY,
I'LL BE FREE.

32:53.772 --> 32:55.674
- SEAN.

32:55.774 --> 32:58.044
- HELLO, RUTH.

32:58.144 --> 33:00.112
I'VE COME
TO GIVE CONFESSION.

33:04.483 --> 33:07.553
- YOU'RE A BAPTIZED
CONGREGATIONALIST NOW.

33:07.653 --> 33:10.322
YOU SHOULD PRAY TO GOD,
NOT ME.

33:14.393 --> 33:17.396
- DO YOU BELIEVE
A PERSON CAN CHANGE, RUTH?

33:17.496 --> 33:21.133
MAKE AMENDS FOR THE THINGS
THEY'VE DONE?

33:26.805 --> 33:29.241
I DON'T THINK

33:29.341 --> 33:31.743
I'VE EVER TOLD YOU

33:31.843 --> 33:33.645
ABOUT MY MOTHER.

33:39.585 --> 33:41.787
I, UH--

33:41.887 --> 33:44.790
I REMEMBER THE DAY

33:44.890 --> 33:50.028
SHE PUT US ABOARD THE BOAT
IN CORK,

33:50.129 --> 33:53.465
MY BROTHER AND ME,

33:53.565 --> 33:55.734
HOW SHE MADE ME PROMISE
TO TAKE CARE OF HIM.

33:55.834 --> 33:59.138
- WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS?
WHY NOW?

33:59.238 --> 34:02.774
- I NEED--
I NEED YOU TO HEAR THIS, RUTH.

34:10.149 --> 34:13.519
- I CAN'T HELP YOU, SEAN.

34:17.723 --> 34:21.160
- YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN.

34:24.896 --> 34:27.099
- NO.

34:27.199 --> 34:28.567
- RUTH, LISTEN TO ME.

34:28.667 --> 34:30.569
- NO, PLEASE, SEAN.
- THIS IS IMPORTANT.

34:30.669 --> 34:33.172
RUTH, RIGHT--
RIGHT BEFORE WE CAME OUT WEST...

34:33.272 --> 34:35.674
- PLEASE GET OUT.
- IT WAS--IT WAS ME...

34:35.774 --> 34:37.709
- PLEASE, SEAN. PLEASE, I--
- AND THESE--THESE TWO GIRLS.

34:37.809 --> 34:39.445
AND MY BROTHER MICKEY,
WHO EVERYONE LOVES.

34:39.545 --> 34:40.712
- PLEASE STOP.
- LET ME TELL YOU

34:40.812 --> 34:42.080
WHO HE REALLY IS.
- SEAN, PLEASE STOP!

34:42.181 --> 34:43.749
[gunshot]
[screams]

34:43.849 --> 34:45.117
[gasps]

34:45.217 --> 34:47.186
[screams]
SEAN!

34:50.322 --> 34:52.391
SEAN!

34:53.325 --> 34:56.195
SEAN.

34:58.697 --> 35:00.166
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

35:00.266 --> 35:02.634
- I JUST SAVED YOUR LIFE.

35:02.734 --> 35:06.205
- [panting]

35:11.277 --> 35:13.345
- HE CAME INTO MY SALOON

35:13.445 --> 35:15.581
AND CONFESSED TO ME
THAT HE KILLED

35:15.681 --> 35:17.749
THAT METCALF FELLOW.

35:17.849 --> 35:20.352
I TOLD HIM HE SHOULD MAKE
HIS CONFESSION TO GOD

35:20.452 --> 35:24.223
AND TURN HIMSELF IN
TO THE POLICE.

35:24.323 --> 35:29.261
- THAT'S A STRONG SENSE
OF CONSCIENCE YOU HAVE, SIR.

35:29.361 --> 35:31.563
- HE LEFT THE SALOON
IN A STATE.

35:31.663 --> 35:35.601
I HAD A BAD FEELING
SEEING HIM COME THIS WAY.

35:35.701 --> 35:38.136
AND WHEN I GOT HERE,
HE HAD HIS HANDS ALL OVER HER.

35:38.237 --> 35:41.773
- HE ASSAULTED YOU,
DID HE?

35:41.873 --> 35:44.843
TRY TO CHOKE YOU
OR STRANGLE YOU?

35:46.778 --> 35:48.780
MAY I?

35:55.587 --> 35:57.923
IT'S JUST LIKE
THE OTHERS.

35:58.023 --> 36:01.360
- THE OTHERS?

36:01.460 --> 36:04.463
- THIS IS GOOD ENOUGH
FOR ME.

36:09.401 --> 36:12.238
IMAGINE MY LUCK.

36:12.338 --> 36:14.273
THE MAN WHO KILLED METCALF

36:14.373 --> 36:17.576
ALSO SUSPECTED
FOR TWO MURDERS IN BOSTON.

36:17.676 --> 36:20.779
I'LL PROBABLY GET A PROMOTION,
MAYBE A RAISE.

36:20.879 --> 36:22.748
- HMM.

36:22.848 --> 36:25.951
GOOD PIECE OF WORK
FOR YOU THEN.

36:30.289 --> 36:32.424
- THERE WAS AN ACCOMPLICE

36:32.524 --> 36:35.327
WITH THE BODIES
IN BOSTON HARBOR.

36:35.427 --> 36:38.497
KILLED A POLICEMAN.

36:38.597 --> 36:41.199
- BOSTON SOUNDS LIKE
A DANGEROUS PLACE

36:41.300 --> 36:44.202
I'D NOT WANT TO VISIT.

36:44.303 --> 36:46.638
- GOOD ON YOU THEN.

37:00.486 --> 37:03.955
- WELL, THANK YOU
FOR THE RIDE, COLLIS.

37:04.055 --> 37:05.857
- NOT AT ALL.

37:05.957 --> 37:08.994
I'M HEADING EAST TO INSPECT
THE UNION PACIFIC'S BRIDGES,

37:09.094 --> 37:12.698
SEE WHICH ONES I'LL HAVE
TO REPLACE WHEN I TAKE OVER.

37:12.798 --> 37:14.266
- WELL, THAT'S--

37:14.366 --> 37:17.669
THAT'S STILL
IN MR. BOHANNON'S HANDS FOR NOW.

37:28.079 --> 37:30.682
- BRAVO, MR. BOHANNON!

37:41.460 --> 37:43.729
- [grunts]

37:50.469 --> 37:53.004
- I UNDERSTAND
YOUR BROTHER CONFESSED

37:53.104 --> 37:54.873
TO THE MURDER OF METCALF,

37:54.973 --> 37:58.877
AND THEN YOU WERE COMPELLED
TO SHOOT HIM IN THE CHURCH.

37:58.977 --> 38:01.747
- YES.

38:03.582 --> 38:06.718
- AND THE BOSTON POLICEMAN
HAS LEFT.

38:09.388 --> 38:11.723
- HE HAS.
- HMM.

38:20.098 --> 38:21.967
WHAT IS IT
THAT YOU WANT, MCGINNES?

38:22.067 --> 38:25.604
- YOU DO UNDERSTAND
WHAT THIS MEANS.

38:26.805 --> 38:27.939
- IT MEANS THAT,

38:28.039 --> 38:31.410
HAD I GONE TO JAIL
FOR ANY REASON,

38:31.510 --> 38:33.712
YOUR PROSPECTS IN CHEYENNE

38:33.812 --> 38:36.482
WOULD HAVE
DIMMED CONSIDERABLY.

38:36.582 --> 38:38.984
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

38:39.084 --> 38:42.554
- I AM
BUT A SIMPLE IRISHMAN

38:42.654 --> 38:45.891
SEEKING HIS FORTUNE
IN THE NEW WORLD,

38:45.991 --> 38:47.325
MR. DURANT.

38:47.426 --> 38:51.830
- WHEN AND IF I CHOOSE
MY HAND TO FALL ON YOU,

38:51.930 --> 38:55.934
IT WILL REACH THROUGH THE VEIL
OF YOUR INCOMPREHENSION

38:56.034 --> 38:58.904
AND SMITE YOU
NOT IN SOME DARK ALLEY

38:59.004 --> 39:01.907
OR A COWARDLY CORNER,
BUT IN FULL DAYLIGHT.

39:02.007 --> 39:03.975
- YOU'RE THREATENING ME?

39:04.075 --> 39:05.110
- AH.

39:05.210 --> 39:08.847
WELL, WITH A LITTLE BIT
O' LUCK,

39:08.947 --> 39:12.951
YOU HAD THE ADVANTAGE
ON ME.

39:13.051 --> 39:15.120
BUT I HAVE BEEN
PUSHED ASIDE,

39:15.220 --> 39:17.022
FALSELY ACCUSED,

39:17.122 --> 39:19.357
ROBBED, WOUNDED,

39:19.458 --> 39:22.861
AND INSULTED ENOUGH.

39:22.961 --> 39:27.132
NOW, YOU WILL WEAN YOURSELF
FROM THESE DELUSIONS,

39:27.232 --> 39:30.101
AND YOU MAY STILL
HAVE A FUTURE HERE.

39:30.201 --> 39:32.003
OTHERWISE, NOT.

39:35.106 --> 39:38.043
GOOD DAY, SIR.

39:49.655 --> 39:52.524
- WHAT HAPPENED
IN BOSTON, MICKEY?

39:58.029 --> 40:00.499
- SEAN.

40:02.167 --> 40:05.403
TWO YOUNG GIRLS,

40:05.504 --> 40:07.806
A FEW MONTHS APART.

40:07.906 --> 40:12.010
A SHOPKEEPER'S DAUGHTER...

40:12.110 --> 40:16.181
AND A SCHOOLTEACHER.

40:16.281 --> 40:17.983
MUCH LIKE RUTH.

40:18.083 --> 40:19.885
SEAN WAS SEAN.

40:26.091 --> 40:28.694
THEY CAME TO BAD ENDS,
THEY DID.

40:33.164 --> 40:36.201
SEAN DID WHAT HE DID.

40:41.973 --> 40:43.975
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?

40:51.282 --> 40:55.086
- SEAN WAS MY BROTHER.

40:55.186 --> 40:58.557
