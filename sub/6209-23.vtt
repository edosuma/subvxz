19:26.569 --> 19:28.564
And to that couple
who taunted the mandrills,

19:28.739 --> 19:31.575
that stuff will come out
with a little club soda.

19:35.664 --> 19:38.416
Harvey Kinkle,
do you know where you are?

19:38.583 --> 19:39.913
Mr. Kraft.

19:40.085 --> 19:45.247
Yes. I'm near a termite mound
that antelopes use as a lookout post.

19:45.883 --> 19:46.916
Help me!

19:48.344 --> 19:49.626
Harvey, where have you been?

19:49.804 --> 19:53.091
I don't know. I'm kind of tired,
my throat's sore,

19:53.267 --> 19:56.138
and I'm suddenly very disdainful
of the way America dresses.

19:56.311 --> 19:57.891
Speaking of which,
weren't we forbidden

19:58.064 --> 19:59.773
to do missionary work on this trip?

19:59.941 --> 20:02.647
I've gotta stop letting my mom
pack for me.

20:02.819 --> 20:04.314
- I'm thirsty.
- Yeah.

20:04.487 --> 20:06.067
Hey, you got any more
of that iced tea?

20:06.240 --> 20:07.700
Nope. Gone, gone, gone. Gone.

20:10.035 --> 20:11.151
Three lemonades, please.

20:11.328 --> 20:13.999
- Right away.
- Hey, you should work here.

20:14.166 --> 20:15.412
You can wear your own clothes.

20:15.584 --> 20:17.992
If I wasn't working for the mouse,
I'd slap you.

20:18.170 --> 20:19.416
So how'd I do?

20:19.880 --> 20:21.340
Well, you passed the survival test.

20:21.507 --> 20:24.177
Now all you have to do is spend
the night alone in Antarctica.

20:24.343 --> 20:27.013
- You're kidding.
- Heh. As a matter of fact, I am.

20:27.180 --> 20:28.972
It's a week.

20:29.141 --> 20:33.471
Eh? Yeow. Man, I crack myself up.

20:33.937 --> 20:35.101
So, what happened to Tootie?

20:35.272 --> 20:38.109
- Did you turn him back into a bone?
- Oh, we couldn't do that to him.

20:38.276 --> 20:39.937
We cleaned him up,
taught him some English

20:40.111 --> 20:41.227
and found a place for him.

20:41.779 --> 20:44.616
Hi. Uh, large fruit punch, please.

20:44.783 --> 20:46.824
- Ice?
- Yeah, sure.

20:47.411 --> 20:48.443
No ice.

20:49.705 --> 20:51.117
Do I know you?

20:52.751 --> 20:54.246
Ice?

20:57.464 --> 20:59.125
I don't know how long
you've known Hilda,

20:59.299 --> 21:02.503
but, uh, she seem
at all strange to you?

21:02.678 --> 21:04.138
Like doing weird things you can't--

21:04.305 --> 21:05.717
[GRUNTING]

21:05.890 --> 21:07.848
Uh-- Well, no, I mean
above and beyond

21:08.017 --> 21:09.976
simply being a woman. Heh.

21:10.145 --> 21:11.806
So Sweden, huh?

21:11.980 --> 21:14.437
Wow. You must be pretty proud

21:14.608 --> 21:16.188
of the way you guys
did down in Nagano.

21:16.361 --> 21:19.030
I-- I have a good dentist
we could, uh, maybe send you to.

21:19.197 --> 21:20.229
[GRUNTS]

21:20.406 --> 21:23.694
Yeah, well, there would be some
gum surgery, no question about that.

21:23.869 --> 21:26.242
I've always liked the paintings
of Edvard Munch,

21:26.413 --> 21:28.288
who's, uh, Swedish.

21:29.305 --> 21:35.469
