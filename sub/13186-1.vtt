01:12.614 --> 01:14.332
It is all gone!

01:14.449 --> 01:16.668
Well, how can it possibly be fucking gone?

01:16.785 --> 01:18.082
There was 40 grand in there.

01:18.203 --> 01:20.581
Yeah, eight months ago
there was 40 grand in there.

01:20.706 --> 01:24.085
Eight months! How many fucking
scatter cushions do you need?

01:24.209 --> 01:26.712
Don't talk to me like I'm a cunt!

01:28.839 --> 01:30.762
Baby? Are you all right?

01:30.882 --> 01:32.759
It doesn't make sense.

01:34.761 --> 01:35.978
I know!

01:36.096 --> 01:39.646
You haven't worked a single day
for eight months.

01:47.733 --> 01:50.327
Take the money for the Jacuzzi
out of the holiday dough.

01:51.028 --> 01:53.406
I can't have it out of action
cos it's for my back.

01:53.530 --> 01:54.827
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.417
Wake up, Jay!
There's no fucking holiday money!

01:57.534 --> 01:59.502
And there is nothing wrong with your back!

01:59.620 --> 02:01.793
It's all in your fucking head.

02:16.553 --> 02:19.056
Fuck. Fucking...

03:03.558 --> 03:05.105
Jay!

03:15.070 --> 03:16.413
Ouch!

03:17.197 --> 03:18.323
Jay!

03:18.865 --> 03:19.957
Jay!

03:20.867 --> 03:22.119
Oh!

03:22.828 --> 03:24.455
Jay!

03:25.664 --> 03:28.508
- 24 tins of tuna?
- Yeah, they were doing a deal.

03:28.625 --> 03:31.253
Can you stop spinning?
You're doing my head in.

03:32.629 --> 03:36.099
- You should've done me a list then.
- I did! It was on the fridge, you left it!

03:36.216 --> 03:39.220
- 10 bottles of wine?
- You invited 'em.

03:39.344 --> 03:41.346
What do you want to drink, Shel? Herbal tea?

03:41.471 --> 03:44.315
Oh, look, it says toilet roll
and it's underlined twice.

03:44.433 --> 03:48.313
Oh, 197 pounds. And, no,
you didn't get any toilet roll, did you,

03:48.437 --> 03:50.064
just, you know, loads of bottles of wine.

03:50.188 --> 03:52.407
- That's good, Jay.
- I'll pop round the newsagents.

03:52.524 --> 03:54.151
They'll have it, won't they?

03:55.819 --> 03:59.323
You're in serious danger of turning
into a miserable cow, Shel.

03:59.448 --> 04:02.998
I'm not going to sit here and have you
glaring at me for another half hour.

04:03.118 --> 04:05.416
Sam? Sammy?

04:05.537 --> 04:07.210
Babe, he's got loads of stuff.

04:07.330 --> 04:10.083
- He doesn't need any more.
- It was four and a half quid, you wally.

04:10.208 --> 04:11.209
He's got loads.

04:11.334 --> 04:12.927
- En guard!
- Cool.

04:13.044 --> 04:15.968
Daddy's promised to do
bedtime stories tonight.

04:19.551 --> 04:21.974
Yeah, we can do that, mate.

05:09.434 --> 05:11.778
Get him! Come on, Sam!

05:32.249 --> 05:36.129
'There were once these two
brave and honourable soldiers,

05:36.253 --> 05:39.257
'and they were in charge of
guarding a man in a car.'

05:39.381 --> 05:41.554
I want a story about king Arthur.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.645
My story is better. No, it isn't.

05:45.470 --> 05:48.314
Are you listening, cos you can
go straight to sleep without one?

05:48.431 --> 05:49.978
What kind of car?

05:51.601 --> 05:53.148
A bullet-proof one.

05:53.895 --> 05:55.989
They were driving around this city, you see.

05:57.107 --> 05:58.199
What city?

05:59.818 --> 06:01.695
Bagdadistan.

06:03.405 --> 06:07.330
So there were these insurgents
and they made a bomb

06:07.450 --> 06:10.078
and it blew up the Humvee
in front of the column.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.830
It's not real though, is it?

06:11.955 --> 06:13.832
No, not any more, no.

06:16.459 --> 06:18.336
You shouldn't shout at Mummy.

06:19.963 --> 06:22.057
Well, she started it, mate.

06:23.008 --> 06:24.931
You are a bit lazy though.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.142
- Who says?
- Mummy.

06:28.263 --> 06:30.140
Does she now?

06:30.932 --> 06:32.104
And me.

06:34.102 --> 06:35.649
Do it, Daddy.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.987
OK.

06:40.984 --> 06:44.409
One, two, three...

06:44.529 --> 06:45.496
Abracadabra.

07:02.714 --> 07:04.466
Hi, how're you doing?

07:04.591 --> 07:08.061
You're looking gorgeous as usual...
Ahh... please God

07:08.178 --> 07:10.272
It's so good to see you. Hi.

07:10.388 --> 07:11.605
- Fiona.
- Come on in.

07:11.723 --> 07:13.350
- You?
- Yeah.

07:14.643 --> 07:16.395
Canny wee tipple... your favourite?

07:16.895 --> 07:18.363
Is that you?

07:18.480 --> 07:21.575
Mmm! Swedish National service.

07:21.691 --> 07:23.238
I didn't know they made girls do that!

07:23.360 --> 07:25.328
Oh, they don't!
They don't, I wanted to do it.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.493
Why should the boys get
to have all the fun, eh?

07:31.826 --> 07:33.544
Here you both are...

07:34.579 --> 07:37.879
- What uniform is that?
- Security assignment.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.296
Is it dangerous?

07:39.417 --> 07:41.670
In danger of getting your knickers
ripped off later, big girl.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.478
The money's good.

07:54.182 --> 07:56.310
The money's really good, Jay.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.028
I can't.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.278
Here.

08:07.612 --> 08:10.365
Try one of these.
Blow your fucking head off.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.367
I'm not eating anything red at the moment.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.795
- Does Shel know?
- What, about the diet?

08:19.916 --> 08:21.463
No, about the job.

08:21.584 --> 08:23.757
Might have mentioned something in passing.

08:24.546 --> 08:27.516
No wonder she's been on my fucking back.
Don't do that, Gal.

08:27.632 --> 08:30.351
I wish someone would fucking
clarify the chain of command here.

08:30.468 --> 08:32.890
- Who's wagging the dog?
- Jay! Jay!

08:34.847 --> 08:36.395
Coming.

08:39.811 --> 08:41.357
That's cleared that up.

08:42.313 --> 08:44.111
Fuck off.

08:45.734 --> 08:48.328
We are done. Bon Appetit. Tuck in, everyone.

08:48.445 --> 08:49.822
Well done. Thank you.

08:49.946 --> 08:50.947
Aww!

08:51.072 --> 08:53.370
- This is beautiful.
- Thank you. It's not my worst.

08:53.491 --> 08:55.914
- Army and Navy.
- Gravy?

08:56.036 --> 08:57.879
Your track record's good.

08:57.996 --> 08:59.088
Dig in.

09:00.707 --> 09:04.302
And now... Cheers and welcome.
Yeah, cheers. Here's to you.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.592
- Lots of love.
- Cheers.

09:06.713 --> 09:07.839
Thank you, thank you...

09:07.964 --> 09:09.762
Is there anything here that you want, Fiona?

09:09.883 --> 09:11.055
I'm really happy. You sure?

09:11.176 --> 09:13.144
What are these little chef's hats about?

09:13.261 --> 09:15.309
I just thought... you could
pick them up with your fingers.

09:15.430 --> 09:17.979
They're little Swedish chefs.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.778
Who is gonna say Grace,
are you going to say Grace?

09:22.896 --> 09:24.489
Oh, Stop.

09:24.606 --> 09:26.574
- Not at my table.
- No?

09:26.691 --> 09:28.489
No, no.

09:28.610 --> 09:30.203
I could do it in Irish for you.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.197
So what-what sort of...

09:32.322 --> 09:34.825
Do you just sell anything? I don't...

09:36.242 --> 09:38.165
No, it's kind of...

09:38.286 --> 09:42.336
No, it's mainly...
sort of IT stuff and, you know.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.300
It's commercial sales.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.966
It's not like knocking on doors and,
you know.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.510
- With a suitcase.
- Yeah, it's not flannels and tea towels.

09:52.050 --> 09:55.020
I know you would assume that
from Gal's accent, but...

09:55.136 --> 09:57.855
It was all right, kinda,
when I was younger and stuff

09:57.972 --> 10:00.316
and when we first come out of the army.

10:00.433 --> 10:04.654
But it's not, you know...
As Sam is getting older and stuff.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.398
It's sort of difficult for him.

10:06.523 --> 10:08.867
He wants his dad, you know.

10:08.983 --> 10:11.111
So, you have to deal with that
while I am away, don't you?

10:11.236 --> 10:12.909
I think it's hard on us.

10:13.029 --> 10:15.578
Three months starts pushing it
we used to say.

10:15.698 --> 10:18.952
- Three months?
- Sometimes, yeah.

10:19.077 --> 10:21.500
- Wow.
- Bit like being a single mum.

10:24.374 --> 10:26.547
- Can I just nip to the loo please?
- Mmm, course.

10:26.668 --> 10:28.966
- It's just round the corner.
- OK, thanks.

10:29.087 --> 10:31.840
The lock's not great,
but we know you are in there,

10:31.965 --> 10:35.139
so I don't think Sam will get
the shock of his life.

10:36.261 --> 10:37.683
- Top up?
- Oh, yeah.

10:37.804 --> 10:40.273
- I'll get it. I'll get it sit down, sit down.
- Sure?

10:40.390 --> 10:42.518
- Old world, new world?
- Whatever you fancy, darling.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.440
Whatever, mate.

10:44.561 --> 10:49.067
Christ. You need a circular
saw to get through this meat.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.906
Because you took the entire rack.

10:52.026 --> 10:54.495
- I thought...
- I'd cut them all up, hadn't I?

10:54.612 --> 10:56.410
I thought there was three big ones.

10:59.033 --> 11:00.910
You could've said to me, darling.

11:01.035 --> 11:02.582
Do you know what, unlike you,

11:02.704 --> 11:04.798
I didn't want to embarrass you
in front of everyone.

11:04.914 --> 11:07.212
As for this, what's all this game?

11:07.333 --> 11:09.335
We've got every dinner set and
bit of cutlery known to man.

11:09.460 --> 11:12.134
You've served the gravy in a fucking Pyrex.

11:13.506 --> 11:16.055
What's that about?
It's like a chemistry set.

11:24.893 --> 11:28.363
ls that all right?
Yeah, that's my favourite.

11:29.439 --> 11:30.907
So, what do you do, Fiona?

11:33.151 --> 11:34.573
Hman resources

11:35.153 --> 11:36.279
Hatchet man.

11:37.405 --> 11:39.828
Sorry. Hatchet person.

11:41.075 --> 11:44.249
What is it? I mean what does that entail?

11:44.370 --> 11:46.919
If there is a department that
is under-performing then...

11:47.040 --> 11:50.840
I go in and assess the extraneous manpower

11:50.960 --> 11:53.429
and de-force accordingly...
I'm waiting for a comment!

11:55.048 --> 11:58.097
I know there is one coming.
You sort of sack people?

12:01.721 --> 12:04.224
It's not personal.

12:04.349 --> 12:06.522
It is probably personal to them...

12:07.644 --> 12:09.021
...and their families.

12:09.145 --> 12:11.898
When was the last time you cared
about the welfare of a family?

12:12.023 --> 12:14.401
Oh, yeah I know, eight months ago.

12:18.154 --> 12:22.830
There's a bigger picture
in the business world.

12:26.704 --> 12:30.129
Your picture doesn't stretch any further
than your front door, does it mate?

12:30.250 --> 12:31.627
You mean the Jacuzzi.

12:35.213 --> 12:38.592
I think the 80's recession was
a lot more glamorous.

12:38.716 --> 12:43.062
No this is, this is much worse.
There's a lot of dirty work to be done.

12:43.179 --> 12:46.604
I'll tell you one lot who
had no time for extraneous.

12:46.724 --> 12:47.896
The Nazis.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.234
Here we go.

12:49.352 --> 12:51.605
I just wish I could have had a go at them.

12:51.729 --> 12:54.152
Difficult for a man to know
where he stands these days.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.527
You should've had a crack at the Mick, mate.

12:56.651 --> 12:59.621
A tour of duty in Belfast would've
done you the world of good.

12:59.737 --> 13:02.206
I've never understood the whole Irish thing.

13:02.323 --> 13:05.668
Cos, I mean,
it's all the same religion, so...

13:05.785 --> 13:07.332
Not really, love.

13:09.247 --> 13:10.294
They're all Christian.

13:10.999 --> 13:13.969
- That's true.
- That's debatable.

13:14.085 --> 13:16.008
What do I get? Fucking Iraq!

13:17.213 --> 13:20.638
- Iraq's over. What about now, eh?
- Yeah?

13:24.304 --> 13:26.147
I've finished.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.982
Abracadabra!

13:39.569 --> 13:42.118
That's my fucking pal,
in front of my fucking pal.

13:42.238 --> 13:44.457
That's not just your fucking pal.
It's not just your fucking pal.

13:44.574 --> 13:45.951
It's not just your fucking house, Jay!

13:46.826 --> 13:48.749
Come on, mate, let's get you to bed.

14:00.548 --> 14:03.552
Don't you pay any attention to them,
they're just over excited.

14:03.676 --> 14:04.768
why?

14:05.762 --> 14:07.981
Because they've been drinking, all right?

14:08.097 --> 14:09.895
Don't you ever drink, do you hear me?

14:10.016 --> 14:11.609
- Promise?
- Not even water?

14:11.726 --> 14:13.103
Especially not that shit.

14:13.227 --> 14:16.447
Do you know the government puts
stuff in it that shrinks your balls!

14:17.273 --> 14:18.866
But you fall out with people, don't you?

14:18.983 --> 14:21.657
You fall out with your mates,
but then you become friends again, don't you?

14:22.445 --> 14:25.244
That's just what mummys and
daddys do sometimes.

14:25.365 --> 14:29.120
That's why they're mummys and daddys
because they're best friends, you know?

14:29.243 --> 14:31.917
Sometimes they fight, sometimes the argue.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.460
You know...

14:33.581 --> 14:36.050
But it doesn't mean anything.

14:36.167 --> 14:37.885
So, don't be worrying, all right?

14:41.339 --> 14:42.932
Good lad.

15:04.612 --> 15:06.239
Sorry.

15:06.364 --> 15:07.911
No. Don't be silly.

15:14.956 --> 15:16.674
How old's your boy?

15:16.791 --> 15:20.386
- Sammy is seven.
- Oh.

15:21.629 --> 15:22.755
You?

15:22.880 --> 15:24.553
No. I never wanted any.

15:25.299 --> 15:26.972
You'll change your mind.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.808
No, I don't think so.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.274
I love kids though...

15:37.228 --> 15:38.650
He was the one, you know?

15:39.480 --> 15:41.153
The love of your life?

15:41.274 --> 15:42.821
No. The one who started it.

16:01.878 --> 16:03.425
Knock. Knock.

16:05.882 --> 16:07.429
Where?

16:08.634 --> 16:10.261
Local, UK.

16:10.386 --> 16:11.888
How many on the list?

16:13.681 --> 16:15.524
Three. Not too strenuous.

16:36.287 --> 16:37.664
How much?

16:37.788 --> 16:39.836
Don't ask. Shel got it.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.092
It's nice.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.928
What do you think of Fiona?

16:45.046 --> 16:47.014
Is she the one you met at your sister's?

16:47.131 --> 16:48.929
No, Boxercise

16:49.050 --> 16:50.677
What?

16:50.801 --> 16:53.896
Hey man, I tell you, a lot of tit women.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.186
It relieves your sexual tension as well.

16:56.307 --> 16:58.230
Fuck's sake.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.399
Hey, don't knock it
till you've tried, you.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.692
She likes it rough then?

17:01.812 --> 17:05.066
- Wouldn't you like to fucking know?
- I'm too old for that shit, so are you.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.948
Yeah? Speak for yourself, granddad.

17:11.196 --> 17:13.575
- Kiev was...
- Yeah, yeah... I know.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.960
Listen man, that was eight months ago.

17:17.078 --> 17:20.833
You've got to get back on the horse again.
Do you know what I mean?

17:20.957 --> 17:23.085
It's all right, it's all right.

17:29.799 --> 17:32.473
The old team back together again.
The two musketeers!

17:32.593 --> 17:34.140
We gonna do it?

17:35.471 --> 17:37.599
Fucking get rid of that.

17:51.279 --> 17:53.532
Come on sweetheart. Come on.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.638
Are you OK? All right?

18:17.430 --> 18:21.276
'You could put almost anything in front of it.'

18:22.977 --> 18:26.322
It doesn't matter how disgusting it is

18:26.439 --> 18:30.410
as long as you put that after it,
you're safe...

18:31.611 --> 18:33.329
Fritzl could have got away with it.

18:34.363 --> 18:36.991
It's OK, cos I don't have my gloves on.

18:38.701 --> 18:40.874
Who'd have thunk it?

18:52.548 --> 18:56.724
# I was very sad last night

18:57.345 --> 19:01.316
# You came by, I was so glad

19:01.432 --> 19:08.862
# Though sadness covered
the smile I kept for you

19:09.649 --> 19:17.329
# I was waiting for the cloud
to pass over

19:18.699 --> 19:23.626
# Then I could show my love...

19:23.746 --> 19:25.840
I'm really sorry.

19:28.417 --> 19:33.765
# You could have made me
laugh if you'd stayed

19:33.881 --> 19:36.475
# But you left

19:36.592 --> 19:44.898
# I was more confused than
I was before you came

19:45.017 --> 19:47.816
# I was frightened I

20:37.737 --> 20:40.035
Cheers! I'll call you, all right?

20:40.156 --> 20:42.909
- You're not driving, mate.
- I am once I find my fucking keys.

20:43.033 --> 20:44.376
Shel, call a cab.

20:44.493 --> 20:46.336
I'm all right man,
dry your eyes for fuck's sake.

20:46.454 --> 20:48.707
- I'll drop the car for you in the morning.
- The fuck you will.

20:48.831 --> 20:51.129
Why do you have such a
problem following orders?

20:51.250 --> 20:52.342
Get your fucking hands off.

20:52.460 --> 20:55.088
Listen, don't go behind
my back to her again!

21:02.344 --> 21:04.096
Get the fuck off me, man!

21:06.599 --> 21:09.227
You ripped my fucking jeans, you cunt!

21:17.693 --> 21:19.195
That's that shirt fucked.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.038
Wha-hey, come on!

21:28.788 --> 21:30.631
Thank fuck that's over.

21:42.343 --> 21:43.890
Babe?

21:44.678 --> 21:47.101
Baby, come on back in, it's getting cold.

21:49.058 --> 21:50.856
Yeah, I'll be up in a minute.

21:56.398 --> 21:58.947
'Wake up.

21:59.068 --> 22:00.285
'Wake up.

22:01.278 --> 22:02.700
'Wake up.'

22:03.197 --> 22:04.744
Wake up.

22:06.575 --> 22:08.077
Wake up.

22:10.955 --> 22:12.423
- Wake up.
- No.

22:13.791 --> 22:15.464
Not now!

22:30.432 --> 22:32.184
Come here, I ain't gonna tickle you.

22:33.727 --> 22:38.198
I got you now. There is no escaping!

22:39.483 --> 22:41.360
I'm sorry about last night.

22:45.406 --> 22:47.374
I was being an idiot.

22:50.411 --> 22:51.788
Shel!

22:53.956 --> 22:55.754
Shel!

22:55.875 --> 22:58.594
Yep. No, that's no problem.
They'll be there.

22:58.711 --> 23:01.180
- Shel!
- What?

23:01.297 --> 23:04.176
- Come out here!
- What is it?

23:05.050 --> 23:08.099
Come out here and I'll show you.

23:08.220 --> 23:11.099
No, you come in here.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.646
Shel. Come out here, you lazy bugger.

23:22.943 --> 23:24.661
That's the last time.

23:26.572 --> 23:28.825
It's an offering, not an insult.

23:28.949 --> 23:30.701
No. She's taking the piss.

23:31.619 --> 23:33.621
It's a cat, it can't take the piss.

23:36.248 --> 23:38.216
What is it?

23:38.334 --> 23:40.211
Oh no, Jay!

23:41.795 --> 23:43.012
It's a rabbit.

23:43.130 --> 23:44.723
Put it in the outside bin.

23:44.840 --> 23:47.810
Fuck am I. I'll cook it up
with some onion and garlic.

23:47.927 --> 23:49.804
Not in my kitchen!

23:49.929 --> 23:51.476
Oh, yeah.

23:53.182 --> 23:54.980
Oh, just get rid of it, babe.

24:01.523 --> 24:03.275
Smell of that.

24:07.154 --> 24:08.952
What's Daddy doing?

24:10.240 --> 24:12.038
Daddy's showing off.

24:12.826 --> 24:14.328
What's he eating?

24:15.162 --> 24:16.789
He's eating a rabbit.

24:17.665 --> 24:19.463
Where from?

24:19.583 --> 24:21.460
From the cat.

24:24.964 --> 24:28.013
Daddy thinks the cat
brings us little presents.

24:28.133 --> 24:30.727
The cat thinks we don't eat
enough in this house.

24:30.844 --> 24:33.472
I just think the cat likes killing rabbits.

25:03.210 --> 25:05.008
- Hey!
- Who goes there?

25:06.463 --> 25:08.181
You all right?

25:10.592 --> 25:12.435
- It was a good one last night, weren't it?
- Eh?

25:12.553 --> 25:14.055
A good one last night.

25:14.179 --> 25:15.897
- You reckon?
- Yeah.

25:17.141 --> 25:19.610
- Nice food and all that.
- It had its moments.

25:24.148 --> 25:27.118
Where's Fiona? Off de-forcing?

25:27.901 --> 25:29.653
Fuck knows.

25:29.778 --> 25:31.246
What?

25:32.239 --> 25:34.617
I think I was a bit of a bad boy last night.

25:37.411 --> 25:41.006
I woke up this morning with a
'Dear John' taped to my cock.

25:41.123 --> 25:42.966
You're joking.

25:43.083 --> 25:44.630
No.

25:49.339 --> 25:50.886
Oh, mate.

25:53.761 --> 25:56.514
Get your shit together,
the client's expecting us.

26:08.776 --> 26:10.574
I like this car.

26:10.694 --> 26:12.537
Looks nice but it's a dog on corners.

26:12.654 --> 26:14.201
Here - better safe than sorry.

26:14.323 --> 26:16.200
It's a bit over the top
for a meeting, innit?

26:16.325 --> 26:17.747
Do you know who's in there?

26:17.868 --> 26:19.415
Cos I fucking don't.

27:18.220 --> 27:20.063
You come with recommendations.

27:22.808 --> 27:24.606
They're well earned.

27:24.726 --> 27:25.818
Good.

27:26.353 --> 27:27.605
Necessary.

27:27.729 --> 27:28.901
Ah, fuck!

27:42.202 --> 27:43.749
It's all right.

27:44.413 --> 27:46.040
No, it's not.

27:47.207 --> 27:49.301
I hear Kiev was stormy.

27:49.418 --> 27:51.671
I'm in the process of rewriting it.

27:54.590 --> 27:55.807
Good.

27:56.592 --> 28:00.597
It's important to learn from
one's mistakes, I always find.

28:07.769 --> 28:09.237
Fuck, that was dramatic.

28:09.354 --> 28:11.402
I'm bleeding on the carpet.

28:14.902 --> 28:18.406
None of them ever say please or thank
you - that's what really fucks me off.

28:18.530 --> 28:21.033
I mean, good manners cost nothing,
sure it doesn't.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.832
How did he know about Kiev?

28:24.953 --> 28:27.081
He was just letting you know that he knows.

28:27.956 --> 28:30.835
- What does that mean?
- Psychology, isn't it.

28:40.177 --> 28:42.771
Fucking hell. Is that your wanking hand?

28:42.888 --> 28:45.607
- No.
- Hmm. Well, you know...

28:46.141 --> 28:47.188
...every cloud...

28:48.060 --> 28:50.483
- One of each?
- Take 'em yeah.

28:52.522 --> 28:54.991
They say that's quite good.

28:55.108 --> 28:57.611
I need to stop and get a
bandage or something.

28:57.736 --> 29:00.080
Got to get through reception
without them noticing.

29:00.197 --> 29:02.245
It's fucking swollen.

29:02.366 --> 29:03.834
I'll walk on that side.

29:03.951 --> 29:05.578
You stay on the left and
I'll walk on the right.

29:05.702 --> 29:07.249
OK.

29:08.038 --> 29:10.291
I could do with clearing up
the sink a little bit.

29:10.415 --> 29:12.167
- Leave that to me, I'll do it.
- OK.

29:43.657 --> 29:46.160
Did you take one of those
this morning, babe?

29:46.285 --> 29:49.664
Yeah, that's all right,
it's like six a day or something.

29:56.545 --> 29:58.092
Handsome.

29:58.714 --> 30:00.261
You going to be all right?

30:07.055 --> 30:08.898
See you soon.

30:09.016 --> 30:10.939
Back in the house - you'll get wet feet.

30:16.273 --> 30:17.820
Go.

30:26.116 --> 30:27.493
Bye.

30:37.502 --> 30:39.049
I love this bit.

30:41.298 --> 30:43.642
We're not going to the fucking seaside, Gal.

30:53.685 --> 30:55.232
Thank you.

30:55.354 --> 30:57.277
Can you put your PIN in there, please?

30:58.690 --> 30:59.907
Here on business?

31:00.025 --> 31:01.993
- Crackers.
- Excuse me?

31:02.110 --> 31:04.954
Novelty key rings. Paper hats.

31:05.072 --> 31:07.291
Plastic fingernails. Doggy charms.

31:07.407 --> 31:09.080
- They're my speciality.
- Sorry?

31:09.201 --> 31:11.249
You wouldn't be, love, honestly.

31:16.041 --> 31:17.839
You don't look like sales.

31:17.959 --> 31:20.132
- Have the rooms got free Wi-Fi?
- No.

31:21.171 --> 31:24.596
I'm afraid that card's been declined.
Let me just try that one more time.

31:24.716 --> 31:26.309
Yeah, do.

31:27.677 --> 31:30.055
I'll just ring for authorisation.

31:30.180 --> 31:32.899
It's OK I'll get it.
Don't worry about it - I'll get it.

31:34.726 --> 31:36.023
Hello, Shel?

31:36.144 --> 31:38.567
Yeah, they just declined
my card at the hotel.

31:40.232 --> 31:42.735
Yeah, they declined it.
No, there's no money in it.

31:42.859 --> 31:46.159
One I look like a right mug,
and two it draws attention to me and Gal.

31:46.279 --> 31:48.953
Straight away - who are these people
who can't afford to pay for the room.

31:49.074 --> 31:51.702
- My name is Richard.
- Nice to meet you.

31:51.827 --> 31:53.374
Friends call me Dick.

31:53.495 --> 31:56.214
I can't believe you haven't
had ten minutes to do it.

31:56.331 --> 31:58.299
You could have done it on your phone.

32:08.593 --> 32:10.687
The soap's nice.

32:10.804 --> 32:13.057
- Is it still in the wrapper?
- Yeah.

32:13.807 --> 32:16.230
Nice. I fucking hate dirty soap.

32:18.603 --> 32:20.355
So, what do you reckon?

32:20.480 --> 32:21.948
Do the usual, follow this guy around;

32:22.065 --> 32:24.067
see what he gets up, who he hangs out with?

32:24.192 --> 32:25.694
What, do it properly, you mean?

32:25.819 --> 32:30.950
Not just mow him down in a hail of
bullets like some Hackney crack head.

32:32.200 --> 32:33.326
Yeah.

32:33.869 --> 32:35.371
Yeah.

32:39.624 --> 32:43.674
He's 45 and lives in 14 Coldwater Road.

32:44.796 --> 32:47.015
If he's got a dog, do we shoot the dog too?

32:47.132 --> 32:48.679
Yeah, well...

32:48.800 --> 32:51.178
Dogs are ten a penny, aren't they?

33:06.359 --> 33:09.283
I just wanted to say 'thank you' to Justin.

33:09.404 --> 33:12.874
His teachings have helped me
put everything in perspective.

33:12.991 --> 33:15.744
I haven't had an anxiety
attack in three weeks.

33:15.869 --> 33:16.961
Don't listen to them.

33:17.078 --> 33:20.082
It's like a fucking worm
boring through my skull.

33:20.207 --> 33:24.383
It's like a graveyard and they
still fucking plod up next to us.

33:24.503 --> 33:26.346
...you could intersect with the group

33:26.463 --> 33:29.933
when I saw you having trouble
rationalizing your emotional response

33:30.050 --> 33:31.643
to Duncan's departure.

33:31.760 --> 33:33.478
I can't wait to see him rationalise
your emotional response.

33:33.595 --> 33:35.563
Don't.

33:36.723 --> 33:38.817
- I'm gonna kill 'em, Gal.
- Don't kill 'em, mate.

33:38.934 --> 33:41.357
I am, I'm gonna massacre
that table of people now.

33:42.270 --> 33:44.238
In a hotel.

33:44.356 --> 33:45.653
I ain't gonna shoot 'em, Gal.

33:45.774 --> 33:48.277
I'm going to do 'em one at a time
and do 'em slow.

33:48.401 --> 33:50.199
- With a butter knife?
- Yeah.

33:50.320 --> 33:53.290
We should have a song.
We should have a song.

33:53.406 --> 33:58.253
- A song... OK, shall I get the old guitar?
- Yeah, go on then.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.168
Oh fuck, here we go.

34:00.622 --> 34:03.171
You're expecting Jeremy Beadle, aren't you?

34:03.291 --> 34:06.795
- But he's dead, he can't help you!
- He's not going to play that guitar, is he?

34:10.674 --> 34:13.893
# Onward, Christian soldiers

34:14.010 --> 34:16.763
# Marching as to war

34:17.472 --> 34:20.726
I With the cross of Jesus

34:20.850 --> 34:24.353
# Going on before...

34:24.478 --> 34:26.152
I even know this one.

34:27.649 --> 34:30.027
I At the sign of triumph...

34:30.150 --> 34:33.155
Look at 'em, fucking happy bastards.

34:34.447 --> 34:38.246
# On then, Christian soldiers, on to... I

34:38.368 --> 34:40.996
You're giving me indigestion.

34:41.121 --> 34:42.998
Oh, sorry.

34:43.581 --> 34:44.879
Apology accepted.

34:46.960 --> 34:50.134
Sometimes God's love can be hard to swallow.

34:50.255 --> 34:52.382
Not as hard as a dinner plate.

34:55.510 --> 34:57.056
God loves you.

34:57.887 --> 35:00.436
Does he? Well, tell God from me...

35:00.557 --> 35:04.607
If you're the kind of people he hangs
about with, stay out of my way.

35:06.563 --> 35:09.908
No more guitar mate, not in restaurants.

35:10.025 --> 35:11.868
There is a time and a place.

35:11.985 --> 35:16.115
And your time and place is
in a very isolated location

35:16.239 --> 35:19.914
where no one is likely to be for
about a fucking hundred years.

35:20.035 --> 35:21.332
OK?

35:22.078 --> 35:24.706
Cos Jimmy Hendrix you ain't.

35:32.005 --> 35:35.726
Very sorry about my friend,
please accept my most humble apologies.

35:35.842 --> 35:38.595
And if you are speaking to the big man,
put a word in for us, will you?

35:38.720 --> 35:40.017
Get them all a drink, love.

35:40.138 --> 35:42.561
Double orange juices all round.

36:30.855 --> 36:33.779
It don't look like the house
of a major villain, does it?

36:35.735 --> 36:39.035
Oh, for fuck's sake,
a fucking priest! Brilliant!

36:39.155 --> 36:41.032
You'll enjoy this one, Gal.

36:41.491 --> 36:43.289
Yeah well, at least it's not a toddler.

36:43.410 --> 36:45.162
What's he got there?

36:47.247 --> 36:49.249
Oh, a new brief case.

37:14.774 --> 37:16.321
You're worried.

37:18.445 --> 37:19.992
Maybe.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.958
He's probably shagging kids.

37:24.075 --> 37:27.796
Might get you a pass on all the
other terrible shit you've done.

37:27.912 --> 37:29.789
It's complicated.

37:31.207 --> 37:35.132
As a parent I'd do them all,
even if I weren't getting paid.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.972
Just for the record,
I've hardly done any terrible shit.

39:19.566 --> 39:21.193
Turn round.

39:22.527 --> 39:24.154
Thank you.

39:56.269 --> 39:58.397
Why do you think he had
that smile on his face?

40:00.690 --> 40:02.408
Probably at peace, you know.

40:03.192 --> 40:04.739
Don't know how much at peace I'd feel

40:04.861 --> 40:06.534
if I was getting a bullet
in the back of my head.

40:11.492 --> 40:13.711
'Can you see me, yeah?'

40:14.996 --> 40:16.998
'Yeah, sorry I just woke up.'

40:17.123 --> 40:18.591
- 'Sorry.'
- 'No, it's fine!

40:18.708 --> 40:20.506
'It's just... Sam was up in the night!

40:20.627 --> 40:22.675
- 'Is he all right?'
- 'Oh yeah, he's fine.

40:22.795 --> 40:24.889
'Bad dreams about the cat.

40:25.006 --> 40:26.929
'How's your room?
I couldn't tell when I booked.'

40:27.050 --> 40:28.472
Yeah, it's all right.

40:29.344 --> 40:31.563
- 'On schedule?
- One down.

40:31.679 --> 40:33.898
- 'Clean?'
- Yeah, course.

40:34.015 --> 40:36.063
Don't worry, I'm all right.

40:36.184 --> 40:38.061
'Babe, Fiona came round.

40:39.187 --> 40:41.030
'With a present for Sam.'

40:41.147 --> 40:43.070
That's a bit weird.

40:43.191 --> 40:45.569
'I didn't like her at first,
but I don't mind her now.

40:45.693 --> 40:47.491
'What do you think?'

40:47.612 --> 40:50.582
- You could do with the company.
- 'Yeah, that's what I thought.'

40:52.158 --> 40:55.002
- Don't let her anywhere near the garage.
- 'I'm not an idiot.

40:55.119 --> 40:57.963
'I've got to go - Sam's
calling, all right?'

40:59.624 --> 41:01.547
- Do you miss me?
- 'Of course I do.

41:01.668 --> 41:03.591
always.

41:03.711 --> 41:05.463
'Love you.'

41:57.890 --> 42:01.565
Looks like nothing this bloke.
They all look like nothing, Gal.

42:01.686 --> 42:03.780
He does look like my uncle Terry though.

42:04.939 --> 42:07.533
Uncle Terry, that's a new one.

42:08.818 --> 42:10.912
He wasn't a special uncle,
he actually was my uncle.

42:11.029 --> 42:13.282
- Right.
- Yeah, he was a cunt.

42:13.406 --> 42:16.910
He wasn't one of the people
your old man took money off of

42:17.035 --> 42:18.457
to be your special uncle?

42:18.578 --> 42:23.049
Oh, come on now. it's a family do.

42:23.958 --> 42:25.835
Have you spoken to Fiona?

42:26.669 --> 42:28.216
No.

42:28.838 --> 42:31.762
She's been round at the house,
talking to Shel.

42:31.883 --> 42:34.887
- Really? That's interesting.
- Yeah...

42:36.637 --> 42:38.184
Says she's waiting.

42:40.391 --> 42:41.938
What, for me?

42:42.769 --> 42:44.942
Well yeah, I'd imagine so.

42:49.776 --> 42:52.325
I'll leave her dangling a bit longer.

42:52.445 --> 42:54.322
Do you know what I mean, keep 'em keen, eh?

42:54.447 --> 42:57.200
Gal, give her a ring. I don't want some...

42:58.284 --> 43:03.040
...glary eyed phantom kipping in
my front room when I get home.

43:03.164 --> 43:05.587
Don't you dare talk
about my Fiona like that.

43:05.708 --> 43:07.802
She's a good looking girl.

43:08.795 --> 43:11.298
She's a bit of a fucking demon
in bed as well, I tell you.

43:11.422 --> 43:13.140
- Yeah?
- Oh!

43:13.257 --> 43:14.804
Fucking hell!

43:17.428 --> 43:19.897
- Details?
- You know...

43:21.140 --> 43:24.940
Put it this way,
I had to shave my pubes afterwards.

43:46.249 --> 43:47.796
Gal?

43:49.043 --> 43:50.761
What, are we off?

43:57.468 --> 44:00.096
Right, we'll go and see what
is in that lock-up first.

44:03.558 --> 44:04.605
Really?

44:06.811 --> 44:08.859
I thought we were just going to observe?

44:10.940 --> 44:13.819
No, we are going to go
and have a look, mate.

44:58.112 --> 44:59.989
Lovely... it's a wank den.

45:00.573 --> 45:02.541
You don't get shot for having a wank den.

45:08.247 --> 45:09.794
Porn business?

45:09.916 --> 45:11.793
There's not enough of it.

45:14.086 --> 45:15.633
No, you're right.

45:20.676 --> 45:22.223
Fuck.

45:22.345 --> 45:24.268
- Uh.
- What?

45:26.140 --> 45:28.768
You don't want to fucking look
at that boy, I'll tell you.

45:28.893 --> 45:30.987
Well, I've got to now, haven't I?

45:36.776 --> 45:38.574
Fucking hell, mate.

45:54.710 --> 45:57.054
Help. Help!

46:04.679 --> 46:06.681
There's been a mistake.

46:06.806 --> 46:08.274
Oh, yeah?

46:08.391 --> 46:10.564
Mistaken identity.

46:12.061 --> 46:14.610
Just remembered we're your burglars?

46:14.730 --> 46:16.073
Really?

46:16.190 --> 46:18.409
If you are, take what you want.

46:19.193 --> 46:20.991
I could do with some reassurance

46:21.112 --> 46:24.241
that the world's not full of
murdering perverts.

46:24.365 --> 46:25.787
We saw the lock-up.

46:26.325 --> 46:28.043
- Christ.
- Yeah.

46:29.704 --> 46:31.877
It's game on, big lad.

46:31.998 --> 46:34.626
Yeah, don't bother. Fucking freak!

46:36.585 --> 46:38.053
Listen mate...

46:39.255 --> 46:41.132
I've seen your wee film.

46:43.092 --> 46:44.935
I'm just the librarian.

46:45.636 --> 46:47.513
Who for?

46:48.556 --> 46:50.229
This is not fair.

46:50.349 --> 46:52.067
I'll show you 'not fair'.

46:55.104 --> 46:56.651
Please.

46:57.898 --> 47:01.619
Don't - because it makes me
hate you more, yeah?

47:01.736 --> 47:03.283
Who films it?

47:05.323 --> 47:08.873
I can't tell you that.

47:36.062 --> 47:39.441
He lives at Greenwold Street.

47:39.565 --> 47:41.818
15 Greenwold Street.

47:44.820 --> 47:46.663
Where do you keep your money?

47:47.740 --> 47:50.289
- In the safe.
- Which room?

47:52.828 --> 47:55.422
Top of the stairs on the right.

48:12.681 --> 48:14.274
Does he know?

48:15.601 --> 48:16.818
What?

48:16.936 --> 48:19.064
Who you are.

48:21.774 --> 48:23.401
He doesn't, does he?

48:24.819 --> 48:27.242
What the fuck are you talking about?

48:28.739 --> 48:30.833
Before he comes back...

48:33.744 --> 48:35.621
...I just want to say...

48:38.833 --> 48:40.380
...thank you.

48:41.544 --> 48:43.091
For what?

48:43.212 --> 48:46.762
I'm glad to have met you.

48:59.687 --> 49:01.234
Nice.

49:12.533 --> 49:14.080
I understand.

49:15.953 --> 49:18.547
You have to do what you have to do.

49:45.524 --> 49:47.071
Thank you.

49:50.863 --> 49:52.410
Thank you.

49:56.494 --> 49:58.588
You crazy fucking bastard.

50:04.627 --> 50:06.220
Oh, fuck!

50:10.049 --> 50:12.802
You can clean this fucking mess
up yourself, you know that?

50:12.927 --> 50:14.474
Fine.

50:17.473 --> 50:19.350
I'm getting a fucking bag.

50:23.479 --> 50:25.527
Let's nip round to that house
on Greenwold Street.

50:25.648 --> 50:27.400
Fuck that, you need a long lie down,
big lad.

50:27.525 --> 50:29.744
I'm going to Greenwold Street right fucking now.

50:29.860 --> 50:32.909
- What the fuck is Shel gonna say?
- Then don't fucking tell her then.

50:33.030 --> 50:34.577
Fuck!

50:36.784 --> 50:38.661
You're well off list here, man.

50:58.097 --> 51:00.191
Right! Don't hang about.

51:02.560 --> 51:04.654
If I'm not back in twenty minutes,
come and get me.

51:04.770 --> 51:06.864
Don't you worry, I will.

51:30.462 --> 51:33.807
Fucking first job in months and he's
gone off again, for fuck's sake.

53:15.651 --> 53:17.904
Oh, for fuck's sake.

53:22.199 --> 53:24.452
Jesus Christ.

54:43.197 --> 54:45.245
Was that twenty minutes?

54:45.365 --> 54:47.242
Let's get the fuck out of here.

54:47.701 --> 54:49.920
What the fuck are we going
to do with him now?

54:54.792 --> 54:57.591
Brilliant. Fucking brilliant.

55:13.143 --> 55:14.861
You're covered in blood.

55:17.689 --> 55:19.236
I'll burn 'em.

55:19.358 --> 55:21.452
They say the sign of a
good painter and decorator?

55:23.529 --> 55:26.453
- What?
- Clean overalls. No bodging.

55:30.118 --> 55:31.665
Point taken.

56:20.127 --> 56:22.095
It doesn't feel wrong.

56:22.754 --> 56:24.848
They were bad people.

56:27.801 --> 56:29.519
They should suffer.

56:35.434 --> 56:38.358
I used to love looking
at tires when I was a kid.

58:00.227 --> 58:02.776
Hi babe, I wasn't expecting you back...

58:03.480 --> 58:06.108
- We haven't got any food.
- That's all right we'll go out.

58:06.233 --> 58:07.701
Erm, it's a school night.

58:07.818 --> 58:09.286
I just want to see Sammy, yeah?

58:09.403 --> 58:12.828
No, he's on a play date, babe.
Can we talk about this later?

58:14.199 --> 58:16.076
Hi Jay, you back?

58:16.201 --> 58:17.953
We've just had a glass of wine.

58:18.078 --> 58:19.421
Yeah, and a moan.

58:22.582 --> 58:25.335
- Do you want to join us?
- Er...

58:25.460 --> 58:28.134
Yeah... I should get me...
all my bits and bobs.

58:29.548 --> 58:32.597
- I should go.
- Oh no, don't be silly. You were here first.

58:32.718 --> 58:34.971
No, stay. It's all right isn't it?

58:35.804 --> 58:37.351
Yeah.

58:50.027 --> 58:51.574
Shel!

58:57.909 --> 58:59.911
Jesus, Jay!

59:03.373 --> 59:04.920
oh, God!

59:05.042 --> 59:07.295
It's infected, babe.
You've got to go see a doctor.

59:07.419 --> 59:08.966
I'm not going.

59:09.713 --> 59:11.260
No...

59:11.965 --> 59:14.309
I'll get some cream or something.

59:18.013 --> 59:21.813
'Would you say you were
suffering from stress?'

59:23.143 --> 59:24.816
'Yes.'

59:24.936 --> 59:28.691
'Do you experience fatigue? Nausea?'

59:28.815 --> 59:31.409
Erm...Yes.
No.

59:35.822 --> 59:37.495
Why do you think that is?

59:37.616 --> 59:39.493
Any particular reason?

59:42.204 --> 59:43.797
No.

59:43.914 --> 59:45.791
Professionally...

59:46.958 --> 59:49.052
Some financial stuff.

59:52.714 --> 59:54.512
I've got a family.

59:55.842 --> 59:59.096
Now what about your sex life, how's that?

59:59.221 --> 01:00:00.723
Normal?

01:00:01.807 --> 01:00:05.903
Listen, my wife said I had to come,
so you could look at my hand and...

01:00:06.019 --> 01:00:07.236
You're fine!

01:00:09.981 --> 01:00:13.326
Yeah, but my hand isn't.
Do you want to have a look at it?

01:00:13.443 --> 01:00:16.367
Better still, I can give you some advice.

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:21.789
What happened to Dr Bapkin?

01:00:22.869 --> 01:00:25.418
The past is gone.

01:00:26.081 --> 01:00:28.379
The future

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:30.377
is not yet here.

01:00:32.379 --> 01:00:34.802
There is only ever this moment.

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:29.603
'Jay!

01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:33.777
'Jay!

01:01:39.321 --> 01:01:40.413
Jay!l

01:01:45.869 --> 01:01:47.337
Bloody...

01:01:52.792 --> 01:01:54.669
Kids maybe?

01:01:56.421 --> 01:01:57.968
Maybe gypsies.

01:02:03.094 --> 01:02:04.471
You all right, sweetheart?

01:02:04.596 --> 01:02:06.473
Someone's murdered the cat.

01:02:07.474 --> 01:02:09.647
Fucking loved that cat.

01:02:10.352 --> 01:02:11.899
Didn't know.

01:02:12.687 --> 01:02:14.940
No, neither did I till it happened.

01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:18.614
- Look...
- What?

01:02:19.361 --> 01:02:22.706
- It's a message, isn't it?
- Yeah, received loud and clear.

01:02:25.992 --> 01:02:29.496
We lifted enough money the other night,
we could sack half this job off, man.

01:02:29.621 --> 01:02:31.168
What?

01:02:31.998 --> 01:02:34.672
There's pictures of us outside
the priest's house, Jay.

01:02:34.793 --> 01:02:37.046
They've got a file on fucking Kiev.

01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:40.140
- Where the fuck did they get that from?
- So fucking what?

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:42.430
Listen man, let's just knock it on the head.

01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:45.178
It's not doing your head any good and it's
fucking not doing mine any good either.

01:02:45.303 --> 01:02:47.305
Yeah, I think you are right,
we should just give up.

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:50.149
We should let things like this
happen and not do fuck all about it.

01:02:50.267 --> 01:02:53.441
We're doing a fucking job, man.
It's not a crusade, all right?

01:02:53.561 --> 01:02:57.282
Right! Then you don't bother, but when I
start something, I fucking finish it, Gal.

01:02:57.399 --> 01:02:58.446
Yeah I know, I know.

01:02:58.566 --> 01:03:01.991
I've been standing around watching
how you fucking finish it.

01:03:02.112 --> 01:03:04.456
- You're arsehole's gone, mate.
- Listen man.

01:03:04.572 --> 01:03:08.042
I can't fucking work with you any more if
you're going to go fucking over the top

01:03:08.159 --> 01:03:09.832
every time you get a fucking
lump hammer in your hand.

01:03:09.953 --> 01:03:11.626
Oh, I'm sorry, Gal.

01:03:11.746 --> 01:03:14.670
I'm really sorry, mate. I'm so sorry.

01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:16.384
I'm really sorry.

01:03:16.501 --> 01:03:18.094
- More?
- Listen, man!

01:03:18.211 --> 01:03:21.135
You're going in there like
a fucking psycho on crack,

01:03:21.256 --> 01:03:22.633
what the fuck's going on?

01:03:22.757 --> 01:03:26.057
- Wait until you see me after this shit.
- Brilliant!

01:03:26.177 --> 01:03:30.978
I'm going to go and bury my fucking
cat and you fuck off out of my gaff.

01:03:36.938 --> 01:03:38.906
- There, that's me done.
- What?

01:03:39.024 --> 01:03:41.903
- Listen, I can't do this any more.
- No, no, Gal please? Please.

01:03:42.527 --> 01:03:44.621
He needs to get help.

01:03:44.738 --> 01:03:47.161
- I know.
- All right, listen. Don't cry.

01:03:47.282 --> 01:03:49.626
- Don't cry.
- Thank you.

01:03:57.542 --> 01:03:59.010
Don't cry, please don't cry.

01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:01.968
I'll call you.

01:04:24.444 --> 01:04:25.991
We'll chat your mum up.

01:04:27.572 --> 01:04:29.119
Get a puppy.

01:04:30.075 --> 01:04:31.952
- OK.
- Yeah?

01:04:33.078 --> 01:04:34.500
Has she gone to heaven?

01:04:37.832 --> 01:04:39.926
I dunno, mate. Maybe.

01:04:42.504 --> 01:04:44.051
Cat heaven.

01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:53.437
You wanna talk to your uncle Gal
really about that side of things.

01:04:56.184 --> 01:04:57.731
Come here.

01:05:07.487 --> 01:05:09.034
Where have you been?

01:05:09.155 --> 01:05:11.874
We went for a walk to look for foxes,
didn't we, mate?

01:05:11.991 --> 01:05:14.119
- Dad said I could have a puppy.
- Did he?

01:05:14.244 --> 01:05:16.121
Yeah, we're going to call it Arthur.

01:05:16.246 --> 01:05:17.793
What if it's a girl?

01:05:17.914 --> 01:05:19.791
Gwinny.

01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:21.799
Hey you, young man,
why don't you go upstairs,

01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:22.840
get out of those dirties,

01:05:22.961 --> 01:05:25.965
- and we'll have a bath in a minute, yeah?
- OK.

01:05:28.258 --> 01:05:30.135
I don't want to talk about it.

01:05:31.136 --> 01:05:33.639
Really? He's ready to walk.

01:05:35.014 --> 01:05:37.437
Good! He's gone soft.

01:05:37.559 --> 01:05:40.688
Wake up. You wake up, fucking wake up!

01:05:47.569 --> 01:05:51.574
Do you think if you get replacements
they'll let you go free of the contract?

01:05:56.953 --> 01:05:58.580
Is that what you want?

01:06:00.248 --> 01:06:04.424
It doesn't look good,
but if we're compromised here...

01:06:29.944 --> 01:06:32.868
We can get you top draw replacements.
They even look like us.

01:06:35.617 --> 01:06:37.836
- It is your job.
- What if we say...

01:06:37.952 --> 01:06:40.171
...fuck you very much and good night?

01:06:40.288 --> 01:06:44.293
Then you die. And your families, they die.

01:06:44.417 --> 01:06:46.761
No wriggle room on that then?

01:06:49.339 --> 01:06:50.556
No.

01:07:00.058 --> 01:07:02.481
How long have we been working for you?

01:07:02.602 --> 01:07:05.822
- Please, don't embarrass yourself.
- I'm asking you a straight question.

01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:08.942
I see you, what you are.

01:07:09.067 --> 01:07:10.660
What are we?

01:07:10.777 --> 01:07:13.280
- You're cogs.
- What?

01:07:13.988 --> 01:07:15.365
What the fuck is this?

01:07:16.574 --> 01:07:18.121
Reconstruction.

01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:22.293
So, keep turning.

01:07:24.123 --> 01:07:26.091
What do you mean by fucking reconstruction?

01:07:26.209 --> 01:07:28.086
Fuck off man... Get your hands off me.

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:52.698
- What's this?
- I'm leaving.

01:07:53.861 --> 01:07:55.329
What?

01:07:55.446 --> 01:07:58.245
I'm taking Sam to the cottage,
just until the job's over.

01:08:01.619 --> 01:08:04.122
You know you're in serious
danger of losing this.

01:08:04.622 --> 01:08:06.169
Is that what you want?

01:08:06.666 --> 01:08:07.713
No.

01:08:11.004 --> 01:08:13.257
- Be good for mummy yeah?
- Yes.

01:08:14.048 --> 01:08:16.220
OK, watch your head, watch your head.

01:08:29.647 --> 01:08:31.524
Turns out he's an MP.

01:08:32.442 --> 01:08:35.286
Is that more acceptable than a priest?

01:08:35.403 --> 01:08:37.279
I can't say I'm not relieved.

01:08:40.241 --> 01:08:41.787
Well, his name's on the list.

01:08:41.908 --> 01:08:44.252
- That's all that matters.
- OK.

01:08:45.997 --> 01:08:47.374
You sure?

01:08:47.497 --> 01:08:49.751
You don't want to go and have
a little cry about it to Shel?

01:08:51.044 --> 01:08:53.296
I might do if I could find her.

01:08:53.421 --> 01:08:54.968
She's gone on holiday.

01:08:55.089 --> 01:08:57.716
That's funny,
she never mentioned anything to me.

01:08:57.841 --> 01:09:01.187
That's funny. I don't really understand
why you're calling my fucking wife, mate,

01:09:01.304 --> 01:09:02.430
I'll be honest with you.

01:09:02.555 --> 01:09:05.479
- Right, you're her husband, aren't you?
- Yeah, leave this now, Gal.

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:07.147
No.

01:09:07.268 --> 01:09:09.236
You shouldn't fucking treat
your wife like a doormat.

01:09:09.354 --> 01:09:10.901
- All right. Thanks.
- Know what I mean?

01:09:11.022 --> 01:09:13.774
She's a lovely wee woman,
and you treat her like a fucking mug.

01:09:13.899 --> 01:09:16.493
All your relationships have
been so very successful, Gal,

01:09:16.611 --> 01:09:19.330
so thanks very much
for your advice, you cunt.

01:09:19.947 --> 01:09:22.166
Oi! What the fuck was that? Fucking...

01:09:25.328 --> 01:09:27.205
Not in the face, fuck!

01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:29.207
Not in the fucking face.

01:09:54.565 --> 01:09:56.363
I'm telling Shel you started it.

01:09:56.484 --> 01:09:58.031
She thinks I'm a saint.

01:09:58.486 --> 01:10:00.363
She doesn't know you.

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:06.499
I'll go get a new one.
She won't even notice.

01:10:06.619 --> 01:10:08.917
She notices everything.

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:12.884
I can't get that Fiona
out of my head, you know.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.503
- Really?
- Yeah, I think it might be love.

01:10:16.129 --> 01:10:19.178
- You don't really know her, Gal.
- Yeah well, you know.

01:10:19.674 --> 01:10:22.177
These things happen like that some times.

01:10:23.761 --> 01:10:26.890
She gaffer-taped your cock.

01:10:27.014 --> 01:10:29.517
I'm putting that down as
an erotic cry for help.

01:10:32.687 --> 01:10:35.281
I can't remember what
I was like before Shel.

01:10:37.108 --> 01:10:39.076
Probably a lonely fucker, like me.

01:10:40.486 --> 01:10:42.614
They say there's someone for everyone, mate.

01:10:42.739 --> 01:10:45.288
Yeah, it's not much to ask, is it?

01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:53.921
Right, let's go and kill this MP then.

01:10:54.041 --> 01:10:55.588
Yeah.

01:11:13.895 --> 01:11:15.738
- Got it?
- Yeah.

01:11:25.156 --> 01:11:27.033
- Did you hear that?
- What?

01:11:31.829 --> 01:11:33.706
- Chopper?
- Don't know.

01:11:35.208 --> 01:11:36.801
The air's good.

01:11:36.918 --> 01:11:38.761
Yeah, we should do this more often.

01:11:38.878 --> 01:11:40.425
What, kill rich people?

01:11:40.546 --> 01:11:42.014
No, get out in the fresh air.

01:12:08.783 --> 01:12:10.330
Dinner's on me.

01:12:15.081 --> 01:12:16.628
Do you want a cup of tea?

01:12:17.875 --> 01:12:20.048
Yeah, lovely.

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:23.298
We'll go down and have
a look at his gaff tomorrow.

01:12:23.422 --> 01:12:25.220
What's the plan?

01:12:25.341 --> 01:12:27.639
I can't be bothered with anything flash.

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:30.013
So we're not just gonna drag
him down to the village square

01:12:30.137 --> 01:12:32.231
and chop his head off with a fucking axe?

01:12:32.974 --> 01:12:34.351
Eh?

01:12:36.102 --> 01:12:38.525
Leave it till two or three, then.

01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:41.782
Let's go down and get an idea
of the layout of the house.

01:12:44.485 --> 01:12:46.283
You look right at home.

01:12:47.071 --> 01:12:49.165
The two musketeers, eh?

01:12:49.991 --> 01:12:52.790
# Oh Mr Bunny, it's gonna get cold

01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:55.333
# I'm taking your coat off your back

01:12:55.454 --> 01:12:58.333
# Hey Mr Bunny, what do you think?

01:12:58.457 --> 01:13:00.130
I What do you think about that? I

01:13:01.961 --> 01:13:03.838
That's not right.

01:13:03.963 --> 01:13:05.510
What?

01:13:05.631 --> 01:13:07.508
One man living in all that.

01:13:09.010 --> 01:13:11.308
None of it's right, Gal.

01:13:12.096 --> 01:13:13.643
That's why we're here.

01:13:17.101 --> 01:13:18.819
Come on, let's bed down.

01:13:18.936 --> 01:13:21.610
He's probably fucking
the scullery maid anyway.

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:28.783
Gal.

01:13:31.032 --> 01:13:32.579
Gal.

01:13:38.039 --> 01:13:39.632
You awake?

01:13:40.499 --> 01:13:43.628
Well, I wasn't, but I am now.

01:13:45.421 --> 01:13:46.968
What?

01:13:53.346 --> 01:13:54.893
L.m

01:13:55.598 --> 01:13:58.727
...really sorry about that stuff.

01:13:59.936 --> 01:14:01.813
Yeah, I know.

01:14:04.649 --> 01:14:06.902
I don't know where it comes from.

01:14:09.403 --> 01:14:11.747
Listen, you're a fucking madman,

01:14:11.864 --> 01:14:14.367
but you're my best mate
and I love you, so...

01:14:15.326 --> 01:14:17.203
Let's just leave it at that, eh?

01:14:19.413 --> 01:14:20.960
Cheers.

01:14:54.615 --> 01:14:56.117
Gal?

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:01.088
- Gal?
- What?

01:15:01.205 --> 01:15:03.458
What the fuck? What?

01:15:27.314 --> 01:15:30.864
Get your shit together - lively.

01:18:41.967 --> 01:18:44.891
- There's too many of them, man. Don't!
- Fuck this.

01:18:45.512 --> 01:18:47.059
Jay!

01:19:32.935 --> 01:19:34.482
Fuck it, come on.

01:19:37.856 --> 01:19:39.403
Are you sure you know where we are?

01:19:39.525 --> 01:19:40.902
Yeah, yeah, I am.

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:45.368
- VVhat's wrong?
- Shush.

01:19:48.909 --> 01:19:50.377
Come on.

01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:04.884
Fuck! It's been bricked up.

01:20:05.009 --> 01:20:07.637
- It wasn't supposed to be here...
- I thought you'd fucking scouted!

01:20:07.761 --> 01:20:09.855
It wasn't supposed to be here, man.

01:20:46.216 --> 01:20:48.059
They are coming from the other way, Gal.

01:20:51.597 --> 01:20:52.814
Jay!

01:21:35.307 --> 01:21:37.184
Jesus Christ.

01:21:44.858 --> 01:21:48.078
Jay?

01:21:48.695 --> 01:21:50.322
Jay?

01:22:19.685 --> 01:22:21.232
Gal?

01:22:23.105 --> 01:22:24.652
Gal?

01:22:38.454 --> 01:22:40.957
C'mon mate.
Jesus, let's get you out of here mate.

01:22:41.081 --> 01:22:42.628
I can't move mate, they've slashed...

01:22:42.749 --> 01:22:44.626
They've slashed my fucking legs.

01:23:03.061 --> 01:23:04.278
We've got to go.

01:23:04.396 --> 01:23:05.943
Come on, please get up.

01:23:06.565 --> 01:23:07.942
I'm done, mate.

01:23:08.066 --> 01:23:09.443
Fuck.

01:23:14.364 --> 01:23:15.991
Gal, we've got to, mate.

01:23:17.743 --> 01:23:19.962
Tell Shel I'm sorry, will you?

01:23:21.622 --> 01:23:23.624
Just do it, do it.

01:23:35.636 --> 01:23:37.764
I'm sorry.

01:23:37.888 --> 01:23:38.935
Thanks.

01:24:12.464 --> 01:24:14.262
It's all over.

01:24:23.058 --> 01:24:24.605
Can we go home now?

01:24:25.394 --> 01:24:28.318
Is he sick? Tired, very tired.

01:24:32.067 --> 01:24:33.444
Shall we take you back to bed?

01:24:53.922 --> 01:24:55.219
Get down.

01:25:04.182 --> 01:25:07.482
Make sure Sam is all right and
turn the lights off upstairs.

01:25:07.603 --> 01:25:09.480
- Let's leave, babe.
- No, we can't go anywhere.

01:25:09.605 --> 01:25:11.357
They've slashed the fucking tyres.

01:25:11.481 --> 01:25:13.028
What the fuck is that?

01:25:16.695 --> 01:25:18.288
It's too noisy!

01:25:19.239 --> 01:25:20.741
Just fireworks.

01:25:29.541 --> 01:25:31.339
I don't think there are many of them...

01:25:37.132 --> 01:25:39.885
Listen, I'm going out there
to find them, yeah? Take that.

01:25:48.018 --> 01:25:49.565
I love you, yeah.
