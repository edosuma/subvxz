01:54.907 --> 01:58.159
You don't have to come
if you don't want to.

01:58.869 --> 02:02.246
I want to, but I have
a million things to do first.

02:09.880 --> 02:11.214
Mom, what's this?

02:12.257 --> 02:14.759
Peanut butter.
Peanut butter and what?

02:15.135 --> 02:16.552
Peanut butter and jelly.

02:16.720 --> 02:19.055
What kind of jelly?

02:19.515 --> 02:20.723
Zucchini jelly.

02:51.923 --> 02:54.341
Five, six, seven!

03:16.197 --> 03:17.281
How we doing?

03:17.448 --> 03:19.783
We're doing fine, Walter.

03:20.702 --> 03:23.328
I wish we could afford
to keep you full time.

03:23.705 --> 03:25.831
So do I, especially now.

03:26.124 --> 03:29.293
Hmm. Is the divorce final yet?

03:30.004 --> 03:32.839
Yes, today. Thank you.

03:33.007 --> 03:37.719
Let's put our heads rogether and
maybe we can work something out.

03:47.271 --> 03:48.646
All right.

03:49.523 --> 03:50.857
Uh, horns up.

03:51.358 --> 03:54.235
One, two, three, four...

03:54.653 --> 03:56.654
...five, six, seven.

03:57.156 --> 04:03.328
O beautiful for spacious skies

04:03.495 --> 04:09.500
For amber waves of grain

04:09.668 --> 04:15.673
For purple mountain majesties

04:15.841 --> 04:21.346
Above the fruited plain!

04:22.473 --> 04:28.603
America! America!

04:28.771 --> 04:34.860
God shed his grace on thee

04:35.028 --> 04:41.325
And crown thy good with brotherhood

04:41.493 --> 04:48.207
From sea to shining sea!

04:52.629 --> 04:55.172
Well, wonderful.
Thank you very much, Felicia.

04:55.340 --> 04:59.218
We appreciate your taking the time
to be here with us today.

04:59.386 --> 05:03.055
Ladies and gentlemen, a big hand
for our most prominent selectman...

05:03.348 --> 05:07.559
...or selectwoman or selectperson,
Felicia Alden.

05:10.355 --> 05:12.564
Thank you, children and Mrs. Spofford.

05:12.774 --> 05:15.859
I can see we have our work
cut out for us.

05:24.327 --> 05:27.454
In these days of
disintegrating values...

05:28.123 --> 05:29.957
...and lost mores...

05:30.333 --> 05:33.043
...when our children
are exposed daily...

05:33.211 --> 05:38.258
...to the hazards of divorce, separation
and families torn asunder...

05:39.135 --> 05:41.845
...it's comforting to think back
to the days...

05:42.013 --> 05:45.223
...when a family like the Lenoxes
strove together.

05:45.391 --> 05:49.227
Those values, embodied
in a man like Major Lenox...

05:49.478 --> 05:53.314
They were men who labored
all their lives...

05:53.524 --> 05:57.944
...so their children would be
well-fed and clothed and educated.

05:58.779 --> 06:00.989
The families endured great hardship...

06:04.076 --> 06:06.161
...yet kept their honor...

06:06.495 --> 06:09.330
...their dignity and their faith in God.

06:10.249 --> 06:15.628
We are the same people;
the same body, the soul...

06:15.880 --> 06:19.674
...the hands and the feet
of our fathers...

06:20.009 --> 06:23.178
...fighting the wars of modern vice.

06:23.679 --> 06:26.681
What was it that tied
these people together?

06:27.016 --> 06:29.184
What was it that made them...

06:29.518 --> 06:33.396
...not a loose gathering of individuals,
but a single bond?

06:33.689 --> 06:39.069
That bond that held them together,
as it holds us together today.

06:39.487 --> 06:42.156
That bond that has stood every test...

06:42.824 --> 06:45.201
...is found deep in our consciousness.

06:45.368 --> 06:48.037
An abiding love of liberty.

06:49.206 --> 06:52.416
For love of liberty, our forbearers...

06:52.626 --> 06:56.212
...colonies few in number and
with little to defend themselves...

06:56.713 --> 06:59.423
...fought the war for independence...

06:59.925 --> 07:03.344
...what was then the world's
most powerful empire.

07:04.763 --> 07:05.930
For love of liberty...

07:06.098 --> 07:09.183
...those who came before us
tamed a vast wilderness...

07:09.351 --> 07:11.185
...and braved hardships...

07:13.230 --> 07:16.357
Tamed a vast wilderness
and braved hardships...

07:16.525 --> 07:19.401
...which at times were
beyond the limit...

07:23.615 --> 07:28.410
Braved hardships, which at times were
beyond the limit of human endurance.

07:40.048 --> 07:42.800
Come on. Go with your mom. Go on.

07:46.054 --> 07:50.766
Liberty must not be taken for granted.
We thank God for our blessings...

08:22.090 --> 08:24.633
Oh, hi, come on in.
Janey, come on!

08:27.429 --> 08:29.346
Do you believe it's raining?

08:29.514 --> 08:30.639
Duh, no.

08:30.807 --> 08:32.433
I mean, since this morning.

08:32.601 --> 08:33.933
At least it shut Walter up.

08:34.102 --> 08:36.812
The same boring, sanctimonious speech.

08:37.606 --> 08:42.275
I thought he'd go on forever.
I was praying for something to happen.

08:42.443 --> 08:45.446
- I was thinking the same thing.
- You were?

08:45.614 --> 08:50.327
I was thinking we're all wet and
how nice it would be to just leave.

08:50.620 --> 08:52.120
Were you really?
- Yeah.

08:52.830 --> 08:54.289
And then it rained.

08:54.457 --> 08:57.792
He's a liar and a lech
and he deserved it.

08:58.002 --> 08:59.586
No, I'm not talking about Walter.

08:59.754 --> 09:01.713
Don't you think it's strange
that we were...

09:01.881 --> 09:04.966
We were thinking the same thing
at the same time? So what?

09:05.176 --> 09:07.177
It won't get us on David Letterman.

09:07.386 --> 09:09.137
- I know, I...
- Let's just have a drink.

09:09.347 --> 09:12.182
Good idea, Janey, party-baby!

09:25.947 --> 09:28.865
You know, he made
a pass at me last week too.

09:29.033 --> 09:32.535
Walter? Oh, please.
I can't even stand to think about it.

09:32.703 --> 09:34.829
Be prepared.
He does not give up easily.

09:35.414 --> 09:39.334
It was broad daylight and his wife
was standing ten feet away!

09:39.502 --> 09:40.585
Poor woman.

09:40.753 --> 09:45.173
Poor woman, my ass. Why does she
put up with it? The man is a Nazi.

09:47.009 --> 09:49.512
Do you think they still... you know?

09:49.763 --> 09:50.846
Yes.

09:51.306 --> 09:54.350
- Really?
I hope his dick is bigger than his I.Q.

09:54.518 --> 09:57.228
Once a week. He told me.
- He told you.

09:57.646 --> 10:00.189
Otherwise she starts throwing things.

10:00.357 --> 10:02.900
At least someone's getting
something once a week.

10:03.068 --> 10:04.443
Yes, heartburn.

10:04.987 --> 10:08.864
Mm. I keep forgetting how many calories
are in these.

10:09.032 --> 10:10.199
Two minutes on the lips,

10:10.367 --> 10:12.034
Forever on the love handles.

10:17.916 --> 10:19.375
Ooh. And congratulations.

10:21.753 --> 10:24.213
Oh, God, I forgot. Your divorce.

10:24.381 --> 10:26.757
As of today, I'm a free woman.

10:27.175 --> 10:29.677
Join the club.
- Thanks.

10:31.221 --> 10:33.389
Heh. Here I go again.

10:34.641 --> 10:37.560
It's over, honey. You'll be okay.

10:37.769 --> 10:40.604
It's a beginning, not an ending.
Right, Alex?

10:40.981 --> 10:43.524
Besides, we still have each other.

10:43.692 --> 10:45.776
Have some more martooni.

10:46.486 --> 10:48.321
- Did you bring the cards?
- Was I supposed to?

10:48.488 --> 10:51.782
- I have them.
- Okay, come on ladies, let's do it! Whoo!

10:55.496 --> 10:57.998
I feel like I'm being unfaithful...

10:58.166 --> 11:00.625
...even if I just think about it.

11:01.836 --> 11:05.589
Sukie, Monty deserted you
and left you with five kids.

11:05.757 --> 11:07.507
- Six.
- Don't start, Alex.

11:07.925 --> 11:10.886
Her husband left because
she had too many kids.

11:11.054 --> 11:13.347
- That's his problem.
- You're oversimplifying.

11:13.514 --> 11:17.392
- Yours left because you can't have any.
- You are definitely oversimplifying.

11:17.602 --> 11:19.144
That's not the point.

11:19.354 --> 11:21.521
What I'm saying is
that it's not your fault.

11:21.689 --> 11:24.983
That doesn't matter.
It's just not that easy.

11:25.151 --> 11:27.903
We're too young to lock it up
and throw away the key.

11:28.071 --> 11:29.529
It's not natural.

11:30.198 --> 11:32.324
What are we doing with ourselves?

11:32.533 --> 11:35.494
Look, Ozzie's dead. I loved him.
He's dead.

11:35.828 --> 11:39.706
So I spend Thursday nights
with you two the rest of my life?

11:39.874 --> 11:43.543
I like our Thursdays.
It's the only time I can relax.

11:43.961 --> 11:47.506
Quilting, macramÃ©.
What did we do last Thursday night?

11:47.673 --> 11:49.299
Chinese aphrodisiac cooking.

11:49.467 --> 11:52.719
Fabulous. Stimulating.
We're not relaxing, we're hiding.

11:53.012 --> 11:54.805
- What from?
- Walter Neff.

11:54.972 --> 11:58.142
Fuck Walter Neff.
I'm not talking about him.

12:00.729 --> 12:03.856
All right, who should we be looking for?

12:04.525 --> 12:07.652
Somebody nice. Somebody you could like.

12:07.820 --> 12:10.154
Somebody with a brain.
Somebody you could talk to.

12:10.322 --> 12:12.573
Somebody you could be yourself with.

12:12.908 --> 12:18.996
Someone to watch over me

12:19.248 --> 12:21.791
All right, I've had it with you two.

12:26.338 --> 12:29.173
He would have to be from out of town.

12:29.383 --> 12:31.843
Especially considering what's in town.

12:32.052 --> 12:34.887
A stranger. That would be interesting.

12:35.764 --> 12:38.891
A tall, dark prince
traveling under a curse.

12:39.268 --> 12:40.768
In Eastwick?

12:41.186 --> 12:42.770
Romantic.

12:43.021 --> 12:46.065
A foreign prince on a big, black horse.

12:48.902 --> 12:53.281
All right, no, no, no.
If we're going to have it...

12:54.199 --> 12:55.867
...let's have it all.

13:07.088 --> 13:09.173
He should be really handsome.

13:09.424 --> 13:10.883
Not too handsome.

13:11.092 --> 13:12.384
Nice eyes.

13:12.552 --> 13:14.011
Nice ass.

13:27.025 --> 13:28.442
Huge.

13:30.028 --> 13:31.361
I prefer small.

13:32.655 --> 13:34.239
Aesthetically, I prefer small.

13:34.407 --> 13:38.327
Sam was huge and there were times
when I could not face it.

13:38.495 --> 13:40.871
I'm in the middle myself.

13:41.039 --> 13:43.707
But who cares?
As long as it works, it's in.

13:43.875 --> 13:45.584
- It's in.
- Okay.

14:10.653 --> 14:14.948
It's a nice thought, but wishing
for it won't make it happen.

14:17.743 --> 14:20.370
Men are not the answer to everything.

14:23.374 --> 14:26.668
So why do we always end up
talking about them?

14:56.407 --> 14:59.200
I said, some man bought
the Lenox mansion.

15:01.370 --> 15:03.204
Did you hear me?

15:03.414 --> 15:05.206
Yeah. Who is he?

15:05.457 --> 15:08.419
He's from New York, no wife, no family.

15:08.712 --> 15:12.548
He told the realtors he needed room
for his pianos.

15:12.924 --> 15:15.134
Apparently, he has a lot of pianos.

15:15.343 --> 15:17.928
How many pianos can one guy have?

15:18.221 --> 15:21.890
Don't you think it's kind of
strange and funny?

15:22.350 --> 15:23.851
What's his name?

15:24.686 --> 15:27.062
You know, that's strange too.

15:28.857 --> 15:30.649
What's strange about his name?

15:30.817 --> 15:34.194
They told me his name
for the column and I forgot it.

15:34.362 --> 15:37.281
So I called back and it's gone again.

15:37.782 --> 15:40.075
It's not like me to forget a name.

15:41.244 --> 15:43.120
It's the big news of the day...

15:43.288 --> 15:47.333
...considering the history of the place.
I wonder if he knows.

15:47.500 --> 15:48.751
I don't know.

15:50.045 --> 15:52.087
Is that Clyde and Felicia?

15:54.883 --> 15:58.844
Yeah. Clyde?
I'll call you back, okay?

15:59.763 --> 16:03.599
I have this culinary piece.
Hi, Felicia.

16:03.767 --> 16:06.977
"Cheeseburger pie"?
Is your column finished?

16:07.479 --> 16:12.108
Here's the track meet, births and
deaths, the senior citizens' news.

16:12.485 --> 16:16.988
The toxic waste article
should be done this afternoon.

16:17.156 --> 16:18.573
This pie looks good.

16:18.783 --> 16:21.368
Did you hear someone bought
the Lenox mansion?

16:35.257 --> 16:39.094
That house is landmark building.
They have no right to sell it.

16:39.428 --> 16:41.805
I can't do anything about that.

16:42.932 --> 16:44.140
No.

16:44.642 --> 16:45.934
You're too busy...

16:46.143 --> 16:51.106
...reporting on the horse trough and
Herbie Prescott's trip to Bermuda.

16:52.316 --> 16:56.820
What's going to happen
to those birds now? Tell me that.

16:57.113 --> 16:58.154
What birds?

16:58.322 --> 17:00.031
The snowy egrets.

17:00.533 --> 17:01.783
Where will they nest?

17:02.201 --> 17:03.493
I don't know.

17:05.037 --> 17:06.287
Exactly.

17:07.707 --> 17:09.665
Felicia, what's the matter?

17:11.794 --> 17:14.922
Honey. It's only a house.
Why are you so upset?

17:15.132 --> 17:16.674
I have a feeling.

17:17.050 --> 17:19.050
The most terrible feeling.

17:19.678 --> 17:22.680
Something is happening.
Something evil.

17:30.814 --> 17:33.482
I'm just glad they're selling.
I was afraid that...

17:33.650 --> 17:36.610
They're not selling, they sold.
Just like that.

17:36.820 --> 17:37.987
I don't understand.

17:38.155 --> 17:42.658
You know I adore the little creatures.
So unreal, and yet the detail.

17:42.993 --> 17:47.830
Little fingers and toes, little pudenda
making a bump. So sweet.

17:48.165 --> 17:51.667
But nobody's even looked
at them sideways in months.

17:52.002 --> 17:53.586
Then this morning...

17:54.004 --> 17:57.631
...this man appeared
out of absolutely nowhere.

17:57.799 --> 18:02.261
So charming. Not really handsome,
but... riveting.

18:02.471 --> 18:05.973
That's it. I was riveted.
I looked into his eyes...

18:06.683 --> 18:09.977
...and had thoughts I hadn't
entertained since World War II.

18:10.145 --> 18:13.439
I think I actually blushed.
Can you imagine?

18:13.607 --> 18:16.234
No, I mean, yeah. So he bought one?

18:16.527 --> 18:19.029
He bought all of them.
Every single one.

18:19.530 --> 18:20.822
So who was he? A tourist?

18:20.990 --> 18:24.534
No, he just bought the Lenox house.
He's moving in.

18:25.369 --> 18:27.162
Do you remember his name?

18:27.330 --> 18:29.539
Of course. His name is...

18:33.544 --> 18:35.045
He told me.

18:35.713 --> 18:37.547
I wrote it down, even.

18:38.633 --> 18:39.716
It was...

18:40.384 --> 18:41.635
...foreign.

18:43.054 --> 18:44.554
It sounded...

18:45.723 --> 18:49.392
It's right on the tip of my tongue,
but I can't...

18:53.898 --> 18:55.732
Isn't that diabolical?

19:48.953 --> 19:50.787
What is that noise?

19:53.040 --> 19:54.791
I don't know.

20:17.648 --> 20:18.732
Outrageous!

20:47.471 --> 20:51.432
Brava!

20:54.353 --> 20:58.272
Bravis!

21:07.449 --> 21:09.367
He bought all of them?

21:09.534 --> 21:12.370
- And now he's here.
- Making goo-goo eyes at Jane.

21:12.537 --> 21:14.956
And the interview too. How weird.

21:15.207 --> 21:19.085
Didn't I tell you?
Oh, it was after we talked.

21:19.378 --> 21:22.546
The paper called him
and asked to interview him...

21:23.715 --> 21:25.968
About the house renovation and all.

21:26.135 --> 21:29.221
He said he'd love to be interviewed
and asked for me.

21:29.389 --> 21:30.430
Why?

21:30.598 --> 21:33.350
I don't know, I mean he wants me
to do the interview.

21:33.559 --> 21:36.103
- Who is he?
- He must have a name.

21:36.270 --> 21:37.896
I just can't remember it.

21:38.272 --> 21:39.940
Why would he ask for you?

21:40.316 --> 21:44.653
Because I'm good at it.
You act like I'm so stupid.

21:45.238 --> 21:47.072
He was in my shop.

21:47.323 --> 21:50.617
You're not stupid. But how does
he know who Sukie Ridgemont is?

21:50.785 --> 21:51.952
I don't know.

21:52.245 --> 21:54.788
He bought the Lenox estate
just like that.

21:54.956 --> 21:58.333
- From New York.
- He has some kind of a foreign name.

21:58.751 --> 22:01.545
Van something or other.

22:04.841 --> 22:07.926
Oh, there you are. How sweet.

22:08.261 --> 22:11.096
They're from him. With a personal note.

22:11.848 --> 22:15.142
- Just the initial "D."
- Yeah, it starts with "D."

22:15.435 --> 22:19.104
- David?
- No. It has an "R" in it.

22:19.272 --> 22:20.605
Doberman?

22:20.857 --> 22:22.107
- Drake?
- Darren.

22:22.275 --> 22:25.861
It's "D" something, "R" something, "L."
Daryl!

22:29.116 --> 22:30.575
- van Horne.
- Yes!

22:30.743 --> 22:32.452
- Daryl Van Horne.
- Daryl Van Horne?

22:32.619 --> 22:34.287
What kind of name is that?

22:40.044 --> 22:41.252
Felicia!

22:47.468 --> 22:48.760
Sweetheart?

22:57.728 --> 22:59.395
Oh, Clyde, honey.

23:00.814 --> 23:02.815
I think I broke my leg.

23:55.537 --> 23:57.204
Looking for me?

23:59.707 --> 24:04.211
Are you looking for me?
Or is this just a happy coincidence?

24:04.546 --> 24:07.047
- Actually, I was...
- Just looking.

24:07.382 --> 24:09.550
Well, too bad.

24:09.884 --> 24:13.262
Have you seen any snowy egrets out here?

24:13.429 --> 24:15.889
- No.
- Neither have I.

24:16.099 --> 24:21.228
Not that I'd know a snowy egret if I was
pissing on one. You want some lunch?

24:22.230 --> 24:24.731
I think it's a little late
in the season.

24:26.484 --> 24:27.651
For lunch?

24:27.819 --> 24:29.278
No, pissing on birds.

24:34.993 --> 24:36.578
Daryl Van Horne.

24:36.829 --> 24:38.079
Alexandra Medford.

24:38.581 --> 24:41.249
The local sculptress.
The one who makes...

24:41.417 --> 24:43.251
...the little booby dolls.

24:43.586 --> 24:45.128
They're just little...

24:45.588 --> 24:49.090
Little, yes, but potent. Full of juice.

24:50.009 --> 24:53.595
Potent. You can feel it
when you pick them up.

24:53.762 --> 24:55.763
I sent a couple to New York.

24:55.931 --> 24:59.517
I have a friend down there.
Terrific fellow.

24:59.768 --> 25:03.104
He has a gallery.
I wanted to hear his opinion.

25:03.480 --> 25:06.399
Of course the scale is wrong.
Get bigger.

25:06.567 --> 25:10.195
Let yourself go.
Get some size into it.

25:11.030 --> 25:14.699
Do you like fish?
We're having fish for lunch.

25:34.470 --> 25:35.970
Interesting, huh?

25:36.513 --> 25:37.680
Oh, yes.

25:37.890 --> 25:39.642
Fidel, that's his name.

25:39.976 --> 25:42.811
Women love him.
They're crazy about him.

25:43.647 --> 25:45.814
He has a big schlong.

25:46.191 --> 25:47.399
Huge.

25:47.567 --> 25:51.153
Well, there you are.
Scale again. Size.

25:51.321 --> 25:53.906
Who knows, maybe it's a masculine thing.

25:54.074 --> 25:59.703
They say women don't care. I'm in
the middle myself. How about you?

26:00.080 --> 26:01.664
How about me, what?

26:01.831 --> 26:05.167
See, women are in touch
with different things.

26:05.418 --> 26:10.256
That's my opinion. It's not a
fashionable one right now, but fuck it!

26:10.590 --> 26:15.261
I see men running around,
putting their dicks...

26:15.470 --> 26:18.222
...into everything,
trying to make something happen.

26:18.390 --> 26:22.393
But it's women who are the source,
the only power.

26:22.894 --> 26:25.521
Nature. Birth. Rebirth.

26:25.730 --> 26:27.982
ClichÃ©. ClichÃ©.

26:28.149 --> 26:30.150
Sure. But true.

26:31.027 --> 26:32.861
Why are you telling me this?

26:34.114 --> 26:37.241
You're an honest woman.
I'm being honest with you.

26:37.409 --> 26:40.744
I like women. I admire them.

26:41.037 --> 26:45.375
But if you want me to treat you
like a dumb twit, I will.

26:45.710 --> 26:48.837
But what for? You have brains, Alex.

26:49.046 --> 26:53.466
More than brains. But you don't
know it. Most women don't.

26:53.718 --> 26:55.010
Are you married?

26:55.219 --> 26:56.386
Good question!

26:56.554 --> 26:59.139
You see? Brains.

26:59.390 --> 27:02.392
The answer is no.
I don't believe in it.

27:02.560 --> 27:05.228
Good for the man.
Lousy for the woman.

27:05.730 --> 27:11.026
She dies. She suffocates.
I've seen it. Then the husband...

27:11.193 --> 27:14.070
...complains to everyone that
he's fucking a dead person.

27:14.238 --> 27:15.613
And he's the one who killed her.

27:18.909 --> 27:20.910
- Where is your husband?
- Dead.

27:21.245 --> 27:24.414
Sorry, but you're one of the lucky ones.

27:24.749 --> 27:28.918
When a woman unloads a husband
or a husband unloads a woman...

27:29.086 --> 27:33.590
...however it happens...
death, desertion, divorce: the three Ds.

27:33.758 --> 27:38.261
When that happens, a woman blooms.
She blossoms.

27:38.804 --> 27:42.098
Like flowers. Like fruit.

27:42.266 --> 27:43.600
She is ripe.

27:44.602 --> 27:46.937
That's the woman for me.

27:54.780 --> 27:57.114
Would you like to see my house?

27:58.325 --> 27:59.825
Yes.

28:01.119 --> 28:03.287
In case anybody ever...

28:03.455 --> 28:05.623
...needed any exercise...

28:06.124 --> 28:09.877
...the pool is right over there,
past the piano...

28:10.045 --> 28:12.463
...where the ballroom used to be.

28:12.964 --> 28:15.299
Interesting word, "ballroom. "

28:15.634 --> 28:16.967
It's one of my favorites.

28:17.135 --> 28:19.136
Over there is...

28:19.971 --> 28:22.390
...my study.

28:26.978 --> 28:29.647
- This is my bedroom.
- Yes, it is.

28:29.898 --> 28:32.400
The Borgias once owned the bed.

28:33.485 --> 28:37.988
Of course, you have to pay for it
with your soul, but...

28:38.532 --> 28:41.325
...what the hell,
I deserve a little luxury.

28:41.660 --> 28:43.911
You have to take care of yourself.

28:44.079 --> 28:46.789
No one will do that for you, will they?

28:53.005 --> 28:56.758
Ha. Ha-ha.
What do you think you're doing?

28:58.344 --> 29:02.848
Being as direct with you as I know how.
I thought you'd appreciate it.

29:05.101 --> 29:08.770
I always like a little pussy
after lunch. What do you say?

29:09.605 --> 29:12.858
- Hmm?
- Are you trying to seduce me?

29:13.192 --> 29:16.862
I wouldn't dream of seducing you,
Alexandra.

29:17.029 --> 29:19.364
I wouldn't insult your intelligence...

29:19.532 --> 29:22.701
...with anything as trivial
as seduction.

29:23.369 --> 29:27.414
But, I would love to fuck you.

29:31.210 --> 29:35.422
I have to admit that I appreciate
your directness, Daryl.

29:35.590 --> 29:37.048
I will try to be as direct...

29:37.216 --> 29:39.593
...and honest with you
as I possibly can be.

29:39.760 --> 29:41.803
I think...

29:42.054 --> 29:46.975
No, I am positive that you are the most
unattractive man I have ever met...

29:47.143 --> 29:48.935
...in my entire life.

29:49.103 --> 29:54.025
This afternoon, you have demonstrated
every loathsome characteristic...

29:54.193 --> 29:57.111
...of the male personality
and even added some new ones.

29:57.279 --> 30:00.531
You are physically repulsive,
intellectually retarded...

30:00.824 --> 30:05.661
...morally reprehensible, vulgar,
insensitive, selfish, stupid.

30:05.913 --> 30:09.123
You have no taste, no sense of humor
and you smell.

30:09.583 --> 30:13.127
You're not even interesting enough
to make me sick.

30:14.546 --> 30:18.424
Um... Would you like to be
on top or the bottom?

30:20.260 --> 30:23.596
Goodbye, Daryl, and thank you
for a lovely lunch.

30:23.931 --> 30:26.766
If that's the way you feel about it...

30:27.100 --> 30:29.477
...that's the way you feel about it.

30:29.770 --> 30:31.854
Is that the way you feel about it?

30:38.362 --> 30:39.654
Who are you?

30:41.490 --> 30:42.865
Just your...

30:43.116 --> 30:45.952
...average horny little devil.

30:47.120 --> 30:48.663
I have to get home.

30:49.289 --> 30:51.749
What have you got to go home to?

30:51.917 --> 30:54.377
There isn't anybody there, is there?

30:54.962 --> 30:56.963
The kid will take care of herself.

30:57.631 --> 31:01.634
She'll eat and fall asleep
on the bed doing homework.

31:01.969 --> 31:03.636
I promise.

31:04.471 --> 31:06.305
And housecleaning?

31:06.640 --> 31:10.309
You clean up the dirt,
there's just more dirt tomorrow.

31:10.644 --> 31:13.938
Make the beds, they just
have to be made tomorrow.

31:14.106 --> 31:17.525
Wash the dishes.
There's more to wash tomorrow.

31:17.693 --> 31:19.694
- I have to make...
- Make dinner?

31:19.987 --> 31:21.654
It just gets eaten.

31:21.989 --> 31:23.823
You've done your best, Alex.

31:24.157 --> 31:27.910
You've done the wife bit,
the motherhood bit.

31:28.078 --> 31:31.497
The car pools, the vegetable garden...

31:31.665 --> 31:34.834
...the needlepoint,
the macramÃ© potholders...

31:35.168 --> 31:38.004
...a cup of coffee with
a neighbor in the morning...

31:38.672 --> 31:42.508
...a couple of drinks,
a couple of pills...

31:43.093 --> 31:45.428
...a little psychoanalysis...

31:46.680 --> 31:48.347
Where are you now, Alex?

31:48.682 --> 31:51.309
Exactly where I want to be
and I'm doing fine.

31:51.476 --> 31:56.689
Pretending to be somebody else?
To be half of what you are?

31:56.857 --> 31:59.359
How long can you last like that?

32:00.194 --> 32:03.572
The world keeps growing,
and you feed it.

32:03.740 --> 32:05.866
But it doesn't feed you, does it?

32:06.034 --> 32:09.870
It washes through you,
down the drain, wasted.

32:10.079 --> 32:12.748
A woman is a hole,
isn't that what they say?

32:13.041 --> 32:16.543
All the futility of the world
pouring into her.

32:19.714 --> 32:23.884
How much can you take, Alex?
How much can you take...

32:24.385 --> 32:26.053
...before you snap?

32:28.056 --> 32:31.558
Lying on your bed,
looking at the ceiling...

32:31.768 --> 32:33.727
...waiting for something to happen.

32:33.895 --> 32:38.482
And knowing all the time that you
were meant for something better.

32:39.067 --> 32:40.692
Feeling it.

32:40.860 --> 32:42.486
Wanting it.

32:43.780 --> 32:45.489
Use me, Alex.

32:46.574 --> 32:47.908
Use me.

32:48.409 --> 32:50.744
Fill me up. I can take it.

32:50.953 --> 32:54.039
Make it happen. Don't wait.

32:54.582 --> 32:56.416
Time is the killer.

32:57.126 --> 32:58.752
Make it happen.

32:59.754 --> 33:01.589
Do it, Alex.

33:02.091 --> 33:03.591
Do it now.

33:58.939 --> 34:00.565
You know...

34:02.151 --> 34:04.152
You sit there in that...

34:05.238 --> 34:07.740
...pathetic excuse of an office...

34:09.659 --> 34:11.326
...reporting gossip...

34:15.290 --> 34:17.458
...while under your very nose...

34:18.333 --> 34:19.668
...evil...

34:20.837 --> 34:22.838
...is doing its worst.

34:27.342 --> 34:29.178
You have no spine, Clyde.

34:31.097 --> 34:33.264
Not one ounce...

34:33.891 --> 34:35.184
...of morality.

34:36.351 --> 34:37.686
Christ!

34:38.188 --> 34:40.188
Even common sense.

34:42.609 --> 34:44.234
Nuclear holocaust.

34:44.527 --> 34:45.860
Murder.

34:46.029 --> 34:48.322
Rape. Apartheid!

34:49.699 --> 34:52.367
Why, these words mean nothing to you.

34:54.370 --> 34:56.371
It's just a local newspaper.

34:56.706 --> 34:58.499
It is local turpitude.

34:58.666 --> 35:02.711
You are a failure, Clyde!
You should be strung up...

35:02.879 --> 35:06.131
...along with that son of a bitch
who bought that house!

35:08.719 --> 35:10.887
Call the nurse!

35:19.688 --> 35:21.064
I am in pain!

35:21.565 --> 35:24.400
- Then take the pill.
- I don't want to.

35:24.568 --> 35:27.070
I'm not going to force it on you.

35:28.280 --> 35:30.281
Is it Alzheimer's?

35:30.699 --> 35:34.911
No. It's the bone marrow.
When a bone breaks...

35:35.246 --> 35:39.749
...bits of fat get in the bloodstream
and the blood vessels of the brain.

35:40.084 --> 35:41.668
It affects the behavior.

35:41.877 --> 35:46.172
She's hysterical. She says things that
I don't know where they're coming from.

35:46.340 --> 35:47.715
It's bone marrow?

35:47.883 --> 35:52.262
Yes. She'll be very upset.
She'll say terrible things.

35:52.429 --> 35:54.597
She may even be paranoid.

35:54.765 --> 35:58.142
It is perfectly normal. It will pass.

36:16.288 --> 36:18.289
What's happening to me, Clyde?

36:18.456 --> 36:20.249
It's all right, sweetheart.

36:23.628 --> 36:26.797
I open my mouth and
the strangest things come out.

36:28.717 --> 36:33.762
You've had a hard time
and you're tired. Try to sleep.

36:48.153 --> 36:50.487
Something is inside me, Clyde.

36:53.033 --> 36:55.534
Something is crawling inside me.

36:57.037 --> 36:58.287
I can feel it.

36:58.496 --> 36:59.830
Something evil.

37:00.999 --> 37:02.833
It's almost here.

37:04.044 --> 37:05.127
Hi.

37:06.171 --> 37:07.755
You!

37:08.173 --> 37:09.673
In there!

38:06.565 --> 38:07.983
Jane.

38:08.234 --> 38:09.901
At last we meet.

38:10.736 --> 38:12.404
Daryl Van Horne.

38:24.876 --> 38:26.210
Cream and sugar?

38:26.420 --> 38:27.712
Sugar.

38:28.422 --> 38:30.756
- One lump or two?
- Four.

38:31.591 --> 38:33.926
- Sweet tooth.
- Sweet everything.

38:34.094 --> 38:38.264
I'm a sugar junkie.
Sugar, chocolate, Coca-Cola...

38:38.932 --> 38:42.768
Uncontrollable appetite.
In every department.

38:45.105 --> 38:46.897
That's not good for you.

38:51.611 --> 38:53.279
It doesn't bother me.

38:53.613 --> 38:57.116
I have a supernatural constitution.
It's genetic.

38:57.743 --> 39:00.578
I don't hold on
this health consciousness shit.

39:00.954 --> 39:02.413
Pardon the language.

39:02.581 --> 39:04.373
I see guys, 60...

39:04.791 --> 39:06.959
...70, breaking their balls...

39:07.627 --> 39:09.962
...to stay fit. What for?

39:10.297 --> 39:13.257
When I die, I want to be sick,
not healthy.

39:14.134 --> 39:16.969
I suppose that's one way
of looking at it.

39:20.140 --> 39:21.433
Do I make you nervous?

39:21.601 --> 39:22.851
Yes, you do.

39:23.311 --> 39:25.812
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I said that.

39:26.981 --> 39:28.815
Truth is best.

39:29.650 --> 39:31.485
Yes, that's so true.

39:43.664 --> 39:45.665
So what brings you to Eastwick?

39:48.336 --> 39:50.837
We're going to have
a polite conversation.

39:51.130 --> 39:52.297
I'm sorry.

39:52.507 --> 39:54.132
No, I don't mind.

39:54.300 --> 39:57.969
I came to Eastwick
because I was drawn here.

39:59.013 --> 40:01.681
I needed a place to settle down and...

40:03.017 --> 40:04.643
...I liked the house.

40:05.686 --> 40:07.145
It has a history.

40:08.189 --> 40:09.523
Rubbish.

40:09.690 --> 40:11.358
No, it's true.

40:12.360 --> 40:15.195
They say they used
to burn witches there.

40:16.531 --> 40:18.365
Hocus-pocus.

40:18.866 --> 40:21.201
The entire witchcraft scare...

40:21.369 --> 40:26.165
...as far back as the 14th century,
was started by the medical profession.

40:26.625 --> 40:27.959
That's right.

40:28.127 --> 40:31.796
They were trying to get midwives
out of the child-birthing business.

40:32.381 --> 40:36.717
That's what most of the women
they burned were. Midwives.

40:37.344 --> 40:38.511
Is that true?

40:39.555 --> 40:41.222
You better believe it.

40:41.390 --> 40:45.726
Just another example of
male-dominated professional society...

40:46.061 --> 40:50.231
...exploiting females
for their own selfish purposes.

40:51.066 --> 40:53.693
Men are such cocksuckers, aren't they?

40:56.738 --> 40:59.740
You don't have to answer that.
It's true.

41:00.409 --> 41:02.618
Their dicks get limp...

41:02.786 --> 41:05.830
...when confronted by a powerful woman,
so what do they do?

41:05.998 --> 41:08.916
Call them witches.
Burn them, torture them...

41:09.251 --> 41:12.753
...until every woman is afraid.
Afraid of herself...

41:13.922 --> 41:15.756
...afraid of men.

41:16.091 --> 41:17.925
And all for what?

41:19.261 --> 41:21.596
Fear of losing their hard-on.

41:26.101 --> 41:27.853
Let's play some music.

41:39.991 --> 41:41.408
Mm.

42:05.308 --> 42:07.309
You play beautifully.

42:08.144 --> 42:10.312
Nothing compared to you.

42:10.647 --> 42:12.481
You're an artist.

42:12.649 --> 42:13.982
Intonation.

42:14.400 --> 42:16.652
Vibrato. Stretch.

42:17.153 --> 42:20.155
You think I'm crazy, but I know music.

42:20.490 --> 42:23.450
It's the one thing that makes me humble.

42:23.993 --> 42:27.120
Not prissy? Our leader says
my intonation is prissy.

42:27.288 --> 42:29.248
You have precision.

42:30.500 --> 42:35.170
Precision is not prissy.
Precision is the foundation of passion.

42:35.672 --> 42:39.007
Passion without precision? Chaos.

42:39.300 --> 42:43.136
Look at your thumb.
Your sublime thumb position.

42:43.346 --> 42:45.681
You really keep the pressure on.

42:45.848 --> 42:48.183
Most men can't, but you...

42:48.768 --> 42:51.603
You have the most beautiful callus.

42:52.689 --> 42:54.356
This hand.

42:56.025 --> 42:59.528
This is your failure.
Your bowing sucks.

43:01.364 --> 43:03.031
My bowing? Why?

43:05.994 --> 43:09.997
Your spiccato sounds like marcato.
Your legato like dÃ©tachÃ©.

43:10.206 --> 43:14.710
You kill the passion. Let it go.
Why are you holding back?

43:15.044 --> 43:17.504
These aren't just notes
you're playing...

43:17.714 --> 43:20.549
...they're phrases. Human outcries.

43:20.717 --> 43:23.552
I understand that! And I practice!

43:23.720 --> 43:26.179
I practice until my fingers bleed!

43:27.223 --> 43:28.849
I know.

43:29.058 --> 43:32.227
It's the sixteenth notes in the allegro.
I can't do it!

43:32.562 --> 43:34.062
Yes, you can.

43:35.232 --> 43:36.858
It's no good.

43:40.571 --> 43:42.071
I don't have it.

43:42.364 --> 43:43.573
I can't do it.

43:43.866 --> 43:46.743
- Yes, you can.
- No, I can't, I can't.

43:52.082 --> 43:53.416
Trust me.

43:54.376 --> 43:55.710
Trust me.

44:07.931 --> 44:12.268
Try.

44:13.103 --> 44:14.729
Let it go. Don't be afraid.

44:14.897 --> 44:17.857
You have great passion in you.
Let it out.

44:18.442 --> 44:20.276
I can take it.

44:20.611 --> 44:22.111
I want it.

44:31.163 --> 44:35.625
Yes.

44:37.544 --> 44:39.630
Yes, that's it.

44:41.049 --> 44:45.135
Relax. Just breathe into it.

44:45.470 --> 44:48.472
Don't tighten up. That's it.

44:49.265 --> 44:51.433
Feel it. Hold it. Love it.

44:51.810 --> 44:53.310
That's it, yes.

44:53.478 --> 44:55.104
Yes, that's right. Now!

45:03.947 --> 45:06.115
That's right. Do you feel that?

45:06.366 --> 45:09.034
Let it wash over you.
Let it tickle you.

46:26.739 --> 46:27.989
Did you miss me?

46:28.199 --> 46:30.158
- Yes.
- Good. I missed you too.

46:30.326 --> 46:31.910
- Like my new top?
- Yeah, it's cute.

46:32.077 --> 46:34.037
Do you want to listen to some tapes?

46:36.540 --> 46:38.917
Alex! Yoo-hoo.

46:39.251 --> 46:40.919
I'm out here!

46:43.255 --> 46:44.798
- Let's go.
- What is that?

46:44.966 --> 46:49.094
We're going to be late.
Carol, the number is on the fridge!

46:49.930 --> 46:52.932
- But you're not dressed.
I'm not naked.

46:55.227 --> 46:57.394
- I don't believe it!
- Neither do I!

46:57.562 --> 46:59.772
But I swear to God,
I couldn't walk for two days.

47:02.442 --> 47:05.236
His penis is amazing.
It bends the wrong way.

47:05.403 --> 47:07.488
The wrong...? Wait a minute!

47:07.948 --> 47:09.615
It bends like that!

47:09.908 --> 47:12.243
- You're terrible.
- No, I'm fabulous.

47:13.453 --> 47:15.663
But just because you went
to bed with him...

47:15.830 --> 47:18.958
No, it's not just that!
It's like he knows me.

47:19.251 --> 47:23.254
He knows everything!
I can't wait for you to meet him.

47:23.463 --> 47:27.299
And I can't wait for Jane to meet him!
Jane will love him!

47:34.349 --> 47:35.683
Jane?

47:35.934 --> 47:37.101
Is that you?

47:37.269 --> 47:40.104
Sukie. Alexandra.

47:40.814 --> 47:42.982
Did you come to fix the plumbing?

47:43.275 --> 47:46.527
I didn't have time to change.
What's your excuse?

47:46.695 --> 47:48.697
I don't need any. I was invited.

47:48.864 --> 47:49.990
So was I.

47:50.157 --> 47:51.491
Hello!

47:51.659 --> 47:53.660
Mm. Darling!

47:53.828 --> 47:54.953
There you are.

47:55.121 --> 47:56.663
Are we late?
- Not at all.

47:56.831 --> 47:58.331
Weren't we playing singles?

47:58.499 --> 48:00.584
- You don't play tennis.
I do now.

48:00.751 --> 48:03.837
Sukie. At last we meet.

48:04.505 --> 48:06.590
Hi. Hello. How are you?

48:06.841 --> 48:08.508
Let me...

48:09.176 --> 48:11.845
...look at those eyes of yours.

48:13.180 --> 48:15.849
You are a fertile creature, aren't you?

48:16.183 --> 48:17.350
Thank you, I think.

48:17.518 --> 48:21.187
I'm reading that rag of a newspaper.
You are a genius.

48:21.689 --> 48:24.691
Wasted. Pearls before swine.

48:25.693 --> 48:30.530
When are we going to do our interview?
I love interviews.

48:30.865 --> 48:33.158
- They're so intimate.
- Anytime you say.

48:33.326 --> 48:37.329
Just the two of us,
banging away, head to head.

48:37.705 --> 48:40.040
Yes, yes.

48:40.207 --> 48:41.458
But not today.

48:41.626 --> 48:44.544
Today is for tennis.
Are you ready, ladies?

48:49.717 --> 48:54.388
What a day!

48:56.892 --> 48:58.893
Is that your perfume?

49:12.908 --> 49:14.533
Double fault!

49:14.743 --> 49:18.579
I'm not blind or deaf!
You don't have to shout!

49:18.747 --> 49:21.540
We're all good friends.
Let's play fair.

49:22.042 --> 49:25.378
I always play fair, okay?
Love-forty, Jane.

49:25.545 --> 49:27.421
- Okay, okay.
- Okay?

49:27.589 --> 49:30.132
- What do you mean?
- Don't let them rattle you.

49:30.300 --> 49:32.927
They're just trying to get you.
Let's go.

49:45.107 --> 49:47.108
Sorry, darling. Lost my head.

49:49.277 --> 49:50.778
Fault.

50:01.457 --> 50:02.874
Ow!

50:21.144 --> 50:22.811
I've got it! I've got it!

50:27.442 --> 50:28.942
It's not coming down.

50:45.626 --> 50:46.835
Come on.

50:47.170 --> 50:49.337
Our game. Sukie serves.

51:25.167 --> 51:26.334
Stop!

52:04.916 --> 52:06.583
Good going, Daryl.

52:16.594 --> 52:18.095
Jane!

52:53.756 --> 52:55.215
Strong drink. What is it?

52:55.383 --> 52:58.260
Rum... vodka...

52:58.469 --> 53:00.137
...brandy...

53:00.305 --> 53:01.638
...acid.

53:02.432 --> 53:03.975
I'm only kidding.

53:04.310 --> 53:07.186
I don't mind.
Drugs have no effect on me.

53:07.354 --> 53:09.480
- Really?
- Neither does alcohol.

53:09.815 --> 53:12.650
It's true. It's boring, but it's true.

53:17.948 --> 53:20.283
Are you going to seduce me too?

53:21.994 --> 53:23.161
Yes.

53:25.122 --> 53:26.456
How?

53:29.001 --> 53:30.460
I don't know.

53:32.838 --> 53:35.340
I should warn you. I get pregnant.

53:36.675 --> 53:39.677
I get pregnant all the time.
At the drop of a hat.

53:39.845 --> 53:42.138
I could borrow your toothbrush
and get pregnant.

53:43.015 --> 53:45.016
I'll keep that in mind.

53:47.353 --> 53:48.770
That doesn't bother you?

53:50.064 --> 53:51.314
No.

53:54.026 --> 53:55.860
You're not like other men.

53:56.862 --> 53:58.321
I'm not.

53:58.530 --> 54:03.034
Most men, well, my husband,
try to keep everything under control...

54:03.369 --> 54:05.703
...pretend everything is normal.

54:05.871 --> 54:10.041
Always rational,
always an explanation for everything.

54:10.709 --> 54:15.046
Men need that, don't they?
To feel everything is solid.

54:15.339 --> 54:18.007
And the world just isn't like that.

54:18.717 --> 54:21.386
Certainly not with you three around.

54:25.516 --> 54:27.141
I don't think...

54:39.029 --> 54:42.031
We're not so different from other women.

54:42.241 --> 54:44.409
Women are more natural, right?

54:44.743 --> 54:48.246
And nature is crazy,
no matter what science says.

54:50.749 --> 54:52.417
So I don't mind.

54:54.420 --> 54:58.756
I don't mind when peculiar things
happen. It's natural...

54:59.091 --> 55:01.634
...because the world
is a peculiar place.

55:02.094 --> 55:04.429
And you're a very peculiar person.

55:05.723 --> 55:06.848
Thank you.

55:09.268 --> 55:11.562
I would love to be a woman.

55:11.980 --> 55:14.231
You would? Really? Why?

55:14.607 --> 55:18.110
Just look what you can do
with your bodies.

55:18.611 --> 55:20.779
Make babies and...

55:21.781 --> 55:24.450
...make milk to feed the babies.

55:27.454 --> 55:29.455
If I could do that...

55:31.291 --> 55:33.292
Who are you, really?

55:35.962 --> 55:38.297
Anybody you want me to be.

58:13.788 --> 58:16.123
Look at what they can do.

58:17.626 --> 58:19.627
These are human beings.

58:30.306 --> 58:33.975
When you're a kid
and don't understand anything...

58:34.310 --> 58:37.479
...you think when you grow up
it will all make sense.

58:37.813 --> 58:40.941
Then when you grow up,
you keep waiting for the day.

58:41.108 --> 58:42.901
You think it ever happens?

58:44.862 --> 58:49.574
It starts when you open your eyes and
realize what the future has in store for you.

58:50.660 --> 58:54.162
And what do you see
when you open your eyes?

58:57.041 --> 58:58.500
Well...

58:59.043 --> 59:01.378
It's a short life, isn't it?

59:02.713 --> 59:05.924
Sometimes I look in the mirror
and I see everything...

59:06.092 --> 59:08.051
...disintegrating faster and faster.

59:13.724 --> 59:15.725
I always see snakes.

59:16.060 --> 59:18.061
Hundreds of them.

59:18.562 --> 59:21.064
They crawl all over me and I disappear.

59:21.399 --> 59:23.734
Then I'm just not there anymore.

59:29.700 --> 59:34.412
Well, I don't mind that it's a short life
or growing old or disappearing.

59:35.080 --> 59:39.083
It's the pain that scares me.
I don't know why there has to be...

59:39.751 --> 59:41.585
...so much pain.

59:42.629 --> 59:45.673
Yeah, well...

59:46.925 --> 59:50.094
We don't deal the deck
down here, we just...

59:50.429 --> 59:52.596
...play the percentages.

01:00:39.312 --> 01:00:47.319
Whores.

01:00:48.446 --> 01:00:49.738
What?

01:00:49.989 --> 01:00:52.616
Whores!

01:00:55.036 --> 01:00:57.454
- Whores.
- Sit down, sit down.

01:00:57.830 --> 01:00:59.498
Look around you.

01:01:00.333 --> 01:01:03.168
Look around you.
Do you see what's happening?

01:01:04.003 --> 01:01:05.504
In our town.

01:01:05.838 --> 01:01:08.256
In our very homes!

01:01:12.011 --> 01:01:14.846
You know who I'm talking about.
You know!

01:01:15.515 --> 01:01:19.017
You know what's going on in that house!
Vice!

01:01:19.268 --> 01:01:20.519
Perversions!

01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:22.687
Shamelessness!

01:01:23.272 --> 01:01:24.773
Cavorting...

01:01:25.191 --> 01:01:27.150
...with that devil!

01:01:27.318 --> 01:01:29.319
She's fine. She's sick.

01:01:31.115 --> 01:01:34.033
No! Drugs! Drugs are next.

01:01:34.535 --> 01:01:35.701
Murder!

01:01:36.203 --> 01:01:37.537
Rape!

01:01:39.039 --> 01:01:40.289
Incest!

01:01:40.707 --> 01:01:42.375
Spanish flies!

01:01:42.793 --> 01:01:45.211
Dildos! Anal intercourse!

01:01:48.549 --> 01:01:50.383
Listen to me!

01:01:51.552 --> 01:01:53.177
- Please.
- Sorry!

01:02:11.238 --> 01:02:13.239
Let's go home, Felicia.

01:02:13.574 --> 01:02:15.741
You employ one of them, Clyde.

01:02:15.993 --> 01:02:17.827
That's nobody's business.

01:02:18.287 --> 01:02:22.707
Oh-ho. It is everybody's business!

01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:27.003
You know, once there was a paradise.

01:02:27.671 --> 01:02:30.590
Then a serpent came into that garden.

01:02:30.841 --> 01:02:33.760
For Christ's sake, Felicia,
would you stop?

01:02:36.389 --> 01:02:38.265
Oh, Clyde.

01:02:39.267 --> 01:02:41.768
I have nothing against a good fuck.

01:02:43.438 --> 01:02:45.689
But there is danger here.

01:02:47.775 --> 01:02:50.777
Somebody has to do something about it.

01:03:21.142 --> 01:03:22.476
Okay, stop.

01:03:22.977 --> 01:03:24.645
Stop! Stop.

01:03:25.772 --> 01:03:27.105
Um...

01:03:29.817 --> 01:03:31.485
Let's get rid of the music.

01:03:32.654 --> 01:03:37.325
Throw it away! Get rid of it.
Let's get rid of the music.

01:03:37.493 --> 01:03:39.661
That's it! Right. Okay, now...

01:03:39.828 --> 01:03:42.497
I want you all to close your eyes.

01:03:44.083 --> 01:03:46.000
Take a deep breath.

01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:49.337
Let it all out.

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:53.841
Now pick up your instrument...

01:03:55.427 --> 01:03:57.595
...and when I count to four...

01:03:58.138 --> 01:04:00.807
...we'll play the shit
out of this thing.

01:04:02.393 --> 01:04:08.898
One, two, three, four.

01:04:12.027 --> 01:04:14.195
That's it, just relax.

01:04:15.698 --> 01:04:17.865
Take it easy. Good.

01:04:19.201 --> 01:04:20.535
Nice!

01:04:21.537 --> 01:04:22.870
Smile.

01:04:23.205 --> 01:04:25.540
Come on, smile, Martha.

01:04:29.211 --> 01:04:32.630
That's it, this is fun.
Come on, this is easy.

01:04:32.965 --> 01:04:36.384
Easy-peasy. That's it, that's it. Good.

01:04:38.053 --> 01:04:41.640
Just let it flow over you. Good.

01:04:45.061 --> 01:04:46.895
Let it tickle you now.

01:04:48.189 --> 01:04:51.525
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.

01:04:51.735 --> 01:04:54.236
Good! You've got it now. Come on!

01:04:54.654 --> 01:04:57.615
Go with it, it's yours! Come on!

01:04:57.824 --> 01:05:00.200
Good! Yes!

01:05:01.161 --> 01:05:06.040
See? You can do it. That's it.
You're doing great. Flow with it.

01:05:07.542 --> 01:05:09.376
That's it, yes!

01:05:09.753 --> 01:05:13.088
These aren't phrases,
these are human outcries!

01:05:39.449 --> 01:05:42.451
Double-double chocolate.
These are fabulous.

01:05:54.964 --> 01:05:56.757
Excuse me.

01:06:17.487 --> 01:06:19.738
Are you buying the paper or not?

01:06:20.865 --> 01:06:22.825
- Um...
- Slut.

01:06:24.911 --> 01:06:26.245
What did you say?

01:06:26.496 --> 01:06:27.830
You heard her.

01:06:40.885 --> 01:06:42.678
Did you see her socks?

01:06:43.513 --> 01:06:45.848
She's not wearing a bra.

01:06:47.268 --> 01:06:48.893
How could you do this?

01:06:49.061 --> 01:06:51.646
We didn't use any names
except for Van Horne.

01:06:51.814 --> 01:06:53.773
You don't know what goes on there.

01:06:54.275 --> 01:06:56.735
The whole town is talking
about you and your friends.

01:06:56.902 --> 01:06:59.195
This is so unfair. It's also untrue.

01:06:59.363 --> 01:07:01.239
- No, no, no, no.
- Yes.

01:07:01.449 --> 01:07:04.951
He filled in the wetlands
and ruined it for the birds.

01:07:05.202 --> 01:07:08.413
He altered the landmark building...

01:07:08.581 --> 01:07:11.166
...and the town is suing him
for $2 million.

01:07:11.333 --> 01:07:13.460
How can you do this to me?

01:07:13.711 --> 01:07:17.046
I work very hard and you know
I'm a good writer.

01:07:17.256 --> 01:07:18.882
All right, Sukie, all right.

01:07:19.049 --> 01:07:20.508
- What?
- Look, look.

01:07:22.094 --> 01:07:24.554
I don't own the newspaper, you know.

01:07:28.559 --> 01:07:30.560
It's Felicia, isn't it?

01:07:31.145 --> 01:07:32.312
She's a...

01:07:33.481 --> 01:07:34.773
...very sick woman.

01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:39.402
She's having a very bad time.
And I don't know what to do.

01:07:40.404 --> 01:07:42.405
I want her to see a doctor.

01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:46.409
Well, not a doctor, you know,
but a... doctor.

01:07:53.668 --> 01:07:54.960
Clyde.

01:07:57.923 --> 01:08:00.424
We went to high school together.

01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:03.844
She was a catch.

01:08:05.931 --> 01:08:10.518
Ever since the accident, she just
hasn't been the same. And now...

01:08:15.774 --> 01:08:17.608
I'm so sorry, Clyde.

01:08:27.618 --> 01:08:29.203
What am I doing?

01:08:29.621 --> 01:08:31.037
Firing me.

01:08:36.627 --> 01:08:39.296
All these terrible things she says...

01:08:41.466 --> 01:08:43.384
...they're not true, are they?

01:08:47.055 --> 01:08:49.180
We should stop seeing each other.

01:08:49.349 --> 01:08:52.309
- Oh, let's not overreact.
- Yes, let's not overreact.

01:08:52.519 --> 01:08:55.063
- I think we should.
- It's a small town, Daryl.

01:08:55.314 --> 01:08:58.274
We haven't done anything.
Why stop seeing each other?

01:08:58.442 --> 01:09:00.277
Clyde says that Felicia has visions.

01:09:00.444 --> 01:09:01.862
Why is it always women
who have visions?

01:09:02.029 --> 01:09:04.072
She sees the devil here in Eastwick.

01:09:04.323 --> 01:09:07.492
If you were the devil,
would you come to Eastwick?

01:09:07.827 --> 01:09:10.078
Oh, I don't know.

01:09:10.246 --> 01:09:11.287
Poor Felicia.

01:09:11.497 --> 01:09:15.125
Poor Felicia? She talked
to all of my students' mothers.

01:09:15.292 --> 01:09:17.042
I had 12 cancellations this week.

01:09:17.211 --> 01:09:19.712
People tell Carol her mother is a dyke.

01:09:19.881 --> 01:09:21.590
You're being sued for millions.

01:09:21.841 --> 01:09:23.508
That is inconvenient.

01:09:23.759 --> 01:09:26.094
She's not kidding about
her medieval morality.

01:09:26.845 --> 01:09:29.848
I think Sukie is right.
Maybe we should stop.

01:09:30.308 --> 01:09:31.390
Maybe she should stop.

01:09:31.559 --> 01:09:33.935
You can't be serious.
We're a family.

01:09:34.185 --> 01:09:37.022
Just for a while
until things settle down.

01:09:39.692 --> 01:09:41.734
Don't let her get to you.

01:09:42.028 --> 01:09:43.528
Have a cherry.

01:09:54.498 --> 01:09:58.210
They are selling pornography
at Schyler's News Shop.

01:09:59.379 --> 01:10:01.881
In the open. On the shelves.

01:10:02.215 --> 01:10:04.550
Children are looking at this...

01:10:07.554 --> 01:10:09.388
It's in broad daylight.

01:10:10.223 --> 01:10:13.059
I can't understand one word
you're saying. Not one!

01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:15.561
They're standing in line...

01:10:22.903 --> 01:10:24.695
Filth in broad daylight.

01:10:24.863 --> 01:10:26.447
Right.

01:10:35.582 --> 01:10:37.458
She made a scene at Schyler's.

01:10:37.626 --> 01:10:40.920
Grabbing magazines from kids
and chasing them.

01:10:41.588 --> 01:10:45.341
She's in pain. Clyde too.
He started drinking again.

01:10:45.592 --> 01:10:48.636
She's twisted. Getting to me
through my kid is sick.

01:10:48.804 --> 01:10:51.806
- We could help.
- By putting her out of her misery.

01:10:51.974 --> 01:10:54.558
Please.
They're lucky to have each other.

01:10:54.726 --> 01:10:58.104
If they don't appreciate that,
I have no sympathy.

01:10:58.605 --> 01:11:01.358
Easy for you to say.
You don't have kids or a family.

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:05.946
You're my family.
I don't want to lose it.

01:11:07.115 --> 01:11:09.950
I just can't stand to see you upset.

01:11:11.369 --> 01:11:13.620
You don't know what it does to me.

01:11:14.956 --> 01:11:16.957
I wish she would just go away.

01:11:19.127 --> 01:11:20.961
Have another cherry.

01:11:40.481 --> 01:11:42.649
He's trying to get inside me.

01:11:43.818 --> 01:11:45.402
He's trying to use me.

01:11:46.821 --> 01:11:49.156
And he's using these women too.

01:11:50.992 --> 01:11:53.326
He wants to take our goodness.

01:11:58.499 --> 01:12:00.751
He wants to get inside me.

01:12:02.838 --> 01:12:04.505
Just like a man.

01:12:05.424 --> 01:12:07.091
Tickle, tickle, diddle, diddle.

01:12:12.681 --> 01:12:16.851
God made us in the image of goodness.
Look what we've become.

01:12:20.856 --> 01:12:22.690
Animals gone mad...

01:12:23.442 --> 01:12:26.444
...devouring the earth and each other.

01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:30.615
Eat, eat, eat, eat!

01:12:34.369 --> 01:12:36.621
Felicia, calm down.

01:12:46.215 --> 01:12:48.049
I know who he is, Clyde.

01:12:49.551 --> 01:12:51.219
Have another cherry.

01:13:04.525 --> 01:13:06.735
What have you been eating?

01:13:07.570 --> 01:13:09.404
Those poor women.

01:13:09.864 --> 01:13:11.573
I have to warn them.

01:13:18.414 --> 01:13:20.415
He'll propagate, Clyde.

01:13:22.418 --> 01:13:24.586
He will increase his number.

01:13:27.382 --> 01:13:30.425
Those women are going to bear him sons.

01:13:31.761 --> 01:13:35.848
He's going to take their love
and destroy the earth with it.

01:13:56.619 --> 01:13:58.453
Let's call it a day.

01:15:19.704 --> 01:15:22.164
- I don't believe it.
- I know.

01:15:24.209 --> 01:15:26.377
I know him. He couldn't do this.

01:15:27.045 --> 01:15:29.630
Alex, don't you get it? God!

01:15:29.798 --> 01:15:30.923
Get what?

01:15:31.091 --> 01:15:32.216
Us!

01:15:33.385 --> 01:15:35.386
Last night, all that talk.

01:15:35.637 --> 01:15:37.471
Those were just words.

01:15:37.722 --> 01:15:40.724
They make things happen.
We make things happen.

01:15:40.976 --> 01:15:43.352
- We had nothing to do with this.
- Yes, we do!

01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:44.979
We should talk to Daryl.

01:15:45.146 --> 01:15:47.982
Why? Why do we have to do
everything Daryl says?

01:15:48.233 --> 01:15:49.441
She's right.

01:15:49.609 --> 01:15:52.403
Some man comes along
and nothing else matters!

01:15:52.737 --> 01:15:54.571
You are so dumb, Jane.

01:15:54.906 --> 01:15:58.158
- This is about us, not Daryl.
- Let's call him.

01:15:58.326 --> 01:16:01.036
Can't you stop thinking
from between your legs?

01:16:01.204 --> 01:16:02.496
You bitch!

01:16:02.664 --> 01:16:03.998
Alex, don't.

01:16:04.165 --> 01:16:06.041
- Shut up, Sukie!
- Will you get off of her?

01:16:50.046 --> 01:16:51.796
Anybody call?

01:17:36.675 --> 01:17:38.927
Hello?
- Hi.

01:17:39.678 --> 01:17:42.680
- Daryl?
- Yeah. Remember me?

01:17:43.891 --> 01:17:44.933
How are you?

01:17:47.019 --> 01:17:49.854
I'm hanging in there.
What do you want?

01:17:51.023 --> 01:17:55.276
Nothing. I just called
to see how you are, you know?

01:17:56.028 --> 01:17:58.363
See how things were going.

01:17:59.198 --> 01:18:00.532
I'm fine.

01:18:04.703 --> 01:18:08.915
I wanted to see how you were,
you know?

01:18:09.708 --> 01:18:11.876
Make sure you were okay.

01:18:12.545 --> 01:18:16.548
Make sure you didn't have any
uncontrollable desire to see me.

01:18:17.758 --> 01:18:22.430
In case you were missing me and
you were too embarrassed to call...

01:18:22.639 --> 01:18:24.181
...I called first.

01:18:24.349 --> 01:18:28.018
Then you could feel superior
and see me at the same time.

01:18:29.813 --> 01:18:31.313
What do you say?

01:18:32.315 --> 01:18:35.651
I don't feel superior. I feel terrible.

01:18:37.362 --> 01:18:39.363
I feel terrible too.

01:18:39.698 --> 01:18:42.992
If we both feel terrible,
can't we do something about it?

01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:44.660
What's going on here?

01:18:44.828 --> 01:18:47.830
Nobody's calling me.
Nobody's coming to see me.

01:18:47.998 --> 01:18:49.874
- No...
- I just think we need some time.

01:18:50.041 --> 01:18:51.542
We need a little time, okay?

01:18:51.710 --> 01:18:55.212
No, it's not okay, Alex.
I don't understand.

01:18:55.547 --> 01:18:58.299
Somebody died, Daryl.
Felicia is dead.

01:18:59.551 --> 01:19:01.177
Yeah, well...

01:19:02.053 --> 01:19:05.556
People die all the time.
She was in a bad way.

01:19:05.724 --> 01:19:07.391
It has nothing to do with us.

01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:12.646
I can't talk to you.
Don't call me, because I...

01:19:12.898 --> 01:19:14.148
Don't hang up!

01:19:14.316 --> 01:19:17.818
Alex, don't do this! This is not fair!

01:19:58.110 --> 01:20:00.278
Happy birthday!

01:20:01.697 --> 01:20:03.114
It's not my birthday.

01:20:04.116 --> 01:20:05.158
It isn't?

01:20:06.285 --> 01:20:08.161
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

01:20:11.290 --> 01:20:12.958
Well, what the hell.

01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:15.961
Happy whatever day.

01:20:16.295 --> 01:20:18.463
These are my favorite fruit.

01:20:18.965 --> 01:20:21.049
I can't accept those, Daryl.

01:20:27.974 --> 01:20:30.309
I'm freezing my nuts off out here.

01:20:30.561 --> 01:20:33.145
I can't ask you in, I'm sorry.

01:20:34.982 --> 01:20:38.734
Not even for a little while?
Just to dry off.

01:20:39.820 --> 01:20:42.071
Talk to the kids maybe.

01:20:42.990 --> 01:20:45.324
No. You have to go away.

01:20:45.993 --> 01:20:49.662
You have to go away now.
I can't see you or talk to you.

01:20:49.997 --> 01:20:52.331
I'm sorry, Daryl, but I can't!

01:21:31.204 --> 01:21:32.372
Jane?

01:21:43.926 --> 01:21:45.510
Hello.

01:21:48.598 --> 01:21:50.057
Give me that.

01:22:11.871 --> 01:22:13.830
Mrs. Spofford?
- What's wrong with me?

01:22:13.998 --> 01:22:17.084
Nothing. You're pregnant.

01:22:21.255 --> 01:22:22.923
Three or four weeks.

01:22:25.510 --> 01:22:27.094
Are you sure?

01:22:29.889 --> 01:22:33.725
I thought something was really wrong.
Are you sure?

01:22:34.102 --> 01:22:35.978
Do you need a doctor?
We could recommend...

01:22:36.146 --> 01:22:37.730
No, no, no, I... No.

01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:39.607
Thank you so much.

01:22:40.609 --> 01:22:42.777
Mrs. Spofford, your clothes.

01:22:56.417 --> 01:22:58.376
Do you think it ever happens?

01:22:59.461 --> 01:23:01.129
It starts when you open your eyes...

01:23:01.296 --> 01:23:03.798
...and realize what the future
has in store for you.

01:23:03.966 --> 01:23:06.843
And what do you see
when you open your eyes?

01:23:09.805 --> 01:23:11.139
Well, short life.

01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:13.307
I want to surprise him.

01:23:25.988 --> 01:23:28.322
It's a short life, isn't it?

01:23:29.575 --> 01:23:32.493
I look in the mirror
and see everything...

01:23:33.162 --> 01:23:35.663
...disintegrating faster and faster.

01:23:37.583 --> 01:23:40.169
It's a short life, isn't it?

01:23:41.254 --> 01:23:44.506
I look in the mirror
and see everything...

01:23:44.758 --> 01:23:47.009
...disintegrating faster and faster.

01:24:23.546 --> 01:24:26.215
They crawl all over me and I disappear.

01:24:26.549 --> 01:24:28.550
Then I'm just not there anymore.

01:24:28.885 --> 01:24:30.052
Alex!

01:24:31.930 --> 01:24:33.931
I always see snakes.

01:24:35.225 --> 01:24:37.226
Hundreds of them.

01:24:37.727 --> 01:24:41.980
They crawl all over me and I disappear.
Then I'm just not there.

01:25:26.610 --> 01:25:28.111
Alex, it's me.

01:25:29.947 --> 01:25:33.783
It's me. Just let it go. Let it go!
Look at me!

01:25:34.577 --> 01:25:38.705
Let it go. That's it. Just let it go.

01:25:39.206 --> 01:25:42.625
Pain scares me.
I don't know why there has to be...

01:25:43.794 --> 01:25:45.295
...so much pain.

01:25:57.559 --> 01:25:59.977
I don't know why there has to be...

01:26:00.395 --> 01:26:02.062
...so much pain.

01:27:13.052 --> 01:27:14.719
Can we talk?

01:27:17.556 --> 01:27:21.309
She's still hemorrhaging.
We slowed it down, but...

01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:22.686
Will she be all right?

01:27:22.853 --> 01:27:25.981
If we knew what was wrong,
we'd have a chance.

01:27:26.232 --> 01:27:27.482
Can we see her?

01:27:28.067 --> 01:27:31.236
She's in a lot of pain.
I can't give her anything...

01:27:31.404 --> 01:27:33.905
...until we know what
we're dealing with.

01:27:34.115 --> 01:27:37.575
Okay. Go ahead.

01:27:42.081 --> 01:27:44.916
Sweetheart,
the doctor says you'll be fine.

01:27:46.585 --> 01:27:48.920
He doesn't know what's going on.

01:27:53.260 --> 01:27:54.677
Easy.

01:27:57.931 --> 01:27:59.515
I'm pregnant.

01:28:02.853 --> 01:28:04.437
So am I.

01:28:09.151 --> 01:28:10.860
Alex?

01:28:12.779 --> 01:28:14.780
That son of a bitch.

01:28:19.202 --> 01:28:21.787
Make him stop, please.
Make him stop.

01:28:21.997 --> 01:28:23.998
I will, honey. I will.

01:28:39.473 --> 01:28:41.640
Back off, Fidel!

01:28:42.392 --> 01:28:45.019
Daryl? Daryl!

01:28:45.437 --> 01:28:49.482
Tara Flavor, come on down!

01:28:55.781 --> 01:28:57.490
Daryl?

01:28:57.824 --> 01:28:59.158
Alex?

01:29:00.118 --> 01:29:02.536
- Don't "Alex" me.
- What a nice surprise.

01:29:02.704 --> 01:29:04.622
What the hell do you think you're doing?

01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:07.416
I said, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

01:29:07.751 --> 01:29:09.418
A little housework.

01:29:10.670 --> 01:29:14.840
I've been sending these shirts out,
but Jesus, they come back in pieces.

01:29:15.217 --> 01:29:16.842
Small town.

01:29:17.511 --> 01:29:19.178
Not enough Orientals.

01:29:19.346 --> 01:29:22.515
Fidel's all thumbs
with this kind of thing.

01:29:23.016 --> 01:29:24.683
That just leaves me.

01:29:24.851 --> 01:29:28.145
I'm not talking about your damn laundry,
I'm talking about...

01:29:28.313 --> 01:29:30.356
...Sukie and Jane and me.

01:29:31.608 --> 01:29:36.529
Golly. You girls sure are having
a hard time, aren't you?

01:29:38.115 --> 01:29:39.782
Sukie is very ill.

01:29:42.661 --> 01:29:44.620
Well, I'm sorry to hear it.

01:29:44.871 --> 01:29:46.622
Then do something about it!

01:29:47.124 --> 01:29:50.209
Me? What can I do about it?

01:29:50.710 --> 01:29:52.920
It has nothing to do with me anymore.

01:29:53.338 --> 01:29:54.922
It does, and you know it does!

01:29:55.465 --> 01:29:57.007
No, I don't.

01:29:58.135 --> 01:30:02.264
All I know is we were friends
and the next day I was shut out.

01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:04.141
That's all I know.

01:30:04.934 --> 01:30:07.519
One minute I was the answer
to your prayers.

01:30:07.687 --> 01:30:11.231
Five minutes later, you wouldn't
give me the time of the day.

01:30:11.399 --> 01:30:14.568
Sukie could die!
Don't you understand that?

01:30:15.069 --> 01:30:18.572
- I can't help it.
- Yes, you can. Don't lie to me.

01:30:20.241 --> 01:30:22.075
You deserted me.

01:30:23.161 --> 01:30:24.619
We had a deal.

01:30:24.787 --> 01:30:26.746
- That's no reason...
- Yes, it is.

01:30:27.248 --> 01:30:28.790
You pissed me off!

01:30:29.167 --> 01:30:31.084
Was I supposed to take it like a man?

01:30:31.252 --> 01:30:32.544
I gave you everything I got!

01:30:32.712 --> 01:30:35.922
I gave you more than anybody ever has,
and what do I get in exchange?

01:30:36.090 --> 01:30:38.341
A little thank you?
A little gratitude?

01:30:38.593 --> 01:30:40.635
I get screwed!

01:30:40.845 --> 01:30:43.930
Oh, cut the crap!
What do you want from us?

01:30:44.098 --> 01:30:47.100
I want somebody to do these shirts!

01:30:47.768 --> 01:30:51.771
I want somebody to pay attention to me!
I want some respect!

01:30:52.064 --> 01:30:55.567
I want somebody to take care
of me for a change!

01:30:55.776 --> 01:30:57.986
Huh? How about that?

01:30:58.279 --> 01:31:00.447
What do I want? Christ!

01:31:01.282 --> 01:31:04.118
What does any man want?

01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:06.787
A little affection.

01:31:07.539 --> 01:31:09.457
A little trust.

01:31:11.126 --> 01:31:12.543
Goddamn it.

01:31:13.003 --> 01:31:16.464
Everything I did, I did for you.

01:31:21.887 --> 01:31:23.512
I was wrong.

01:31:24.056 --> 01:31:25.389
Go ahead.

01:31:25.724 --> 01:31:30.144
Go back to your miserable little life.
Fuck me if I care!

01:31:30.562 --> 01:31:34.398
If that's what you want,
that's what you get.

01:31:34.900 --> 01:31:37.568
You are not the only three women
in the world.

01:31:39.988 --> 01:31:41.989
You're hurting people, Daryl.

01:31:43.575 --> 01:31:45.326
What you did for us was great.

01:31:45.494 --> 01:31:48.079
But you can't use your power
to hurt people.

01:31:49.831 --> 01:31:51.499
Don't you understand that?

01:31:52.626 --> 01:31:54.043
No.

01:31:54.670 --> 01:31:58.005
I want my family back together,
that's all.

01:31:59.174 --> 01:32:00.341
You...

01:32:00.759 --> 01:32:02.343
...and Sukie...

01:32:02.511 --> 01:32:04.178
...and Jane.

01:32:05.014 --> 01:32:06.848
I couldn't hurt Sukie.

01:32:07.058 --> 01:32:10.269
I couldn't hurt any of you.
How could I?

01:32:10.979 --> 01:32:12.187
I love you.

01:32:12.355 --> 01:32:14.147
You don't know what love is.

01:32:14.315 --> 01:32:16.942
I can learn.
You could teach me.

01:32:17.151 --> 01:32:18.944
How hard can it be?

01:32:20.405 --> 01:32:23.031
Oh, Alex, let's not fight.

01:32:23.199 --> 01:32:26.535
You can't win.
There's no way you can win.

01:32:27.036 --> 01:32:30.163
There's nothing to go back to,
even if you could win.

01:32:30.331 --> 01:32:31.957
Can't we just...

01:32:32.375 --> 01:32:35.043
...put this behind us and be friends?

01:32:44.304 --> 01:32:45.721
There.

01:32:46.222 --> 01:32:47.639
See?

01:32:47.890 --> 01:32:49.725
Isn't that nice?

01:32:52.145 --> 01:32:53.603
Tell the truth.

01:32:54.564 --> 01:32:57.399
You missed me a little bit, didn't you?

01:32:59.902 --> 01:33:01.903
Yeah, I have.

01:33:02.488 --> 01:33:06.408
So let's kiss and make it better.

01:33:07.827 --> 01:33:10.330
Huh? What do you say?

01:33:12.916 --> 01:33:15.084
What are we going to do with you?

01:33:22.051 --> 01:33:23.676
It stopped.

01:34:21.277 --> 01:34:23.153
Darling, you look perfect.

01:34:23.363 --> 01:34:25.114
Mm.

01:34:34.582 --> 01:34:35.833
Hi.

01:34:37.836 --> 01:34:39.211
You look gorgeous.

01:34:39.379 --> 01:34:40.754
Thank you.

01:34:40.922 --> 01:34:42.172
Feeling better?

01:34:42.340 --> 01:34:46.009
Much better now.
Everything's going to be much better now.

01:35:32.141 --> 01:35:33.558
Fidel.

01:35:33.726 --> 01:35:35.477
We're going to town.

01:35:36.061 --> 01:35:41.024
The ladies have a craving
for bagels and ice cream.

01:37:03.108 --> 01:37:05.109
Three pinches.

01:37:13.076 --> 01:37:14.660
I'd like...

01:37:14.911 --> 01:37:19.248
...a dozen bagels, a pound of gravlax and
what kind of ice cream do you have?

01:37:19.499 --> 01:37:21.918
No ice cream. The freezer's broken.

01:37:22.503 --> 01:37:24.170
Ice cream.

01:37:24.338 --> 01:37:28.300
Um... Well, ahem,
I'll just take the bread and the fish.

01:37:35.766 --> 01:37:37.100
It doesn't look like him.

01:37:37.268 --> 01:37:40.061
It doesn't have to. We know who it is.

01:37:40.229 --> 01:37:43.440
He looks funny with no hair.

01:37:43.608 --> 01:37:44.858
It won't hurt him, will it?

01:37:45.026 --> 01:37:48.194
- No. We just want to send him away.
- Jane, come on.

01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:55.619
No ice cream. Imagine that.

01:37:56.203 --> 01:37:59.873
I'll go see if I can't get some.
You go shopping.

01:38:04.378 --> 01:38:08.381
I said, "A tall, dark prince
traveling under a curse. "

01:38:08.716 --> 01:38:10.383
"Somebody nice. "

01:38:10.718 --> 01:38:12.552
"Somebody you could talk to. "

01:38:17.224 --> 01:38:18.892
- Morning.
- Good morning.

01:38:19.101 --> 01:38:22.062
I'd like some pistachio.
That is pistachio?

01:38:26.193 --> 01:38:30.613
And some chocolate-chocolate chip.

01:38:33.909 --> 01:38:36.118
Are you okay?
- No, my leg!

01:38:37.245 --> 01:38:39.038
Jesus Christ!

01:38:39.247 --> 01:38:40.790
What is it?

01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:46.253
What's the matter?

01:38:48.590 --> 01:38:50.466
Are you having a heart attack?

01:39:20.455 --> 01:39:22.123
Girls!

01:39:22.457 --> 01:39:25.292
Girls? What are you doing?

01:39:28.131 --> 01:39:32.050
Girls! Girls! Please, don't!

01:40:06.210 --> 01:40:08.545
Elijah fled to the mount of God.

01:40:08.838 --> 01:40:12.340
The Lord passed by and a great,
strong wind rent the mountains...

01:40:12.508 --> 01:40:14.676
...and breaked in pieces
the rocks before the Lord...

01:40:45.208 --> 01:40:46.541
Sorry.

01:40:47.376 --> 01:40:49.377
Just having a little trouble.

01:40:50.087 --> 01:40:53.089
A little... trouble at home.

01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:56.718
A little domestic problem.

01:41:05.394 --> 01:41:08.396
Nothing to be alarmed at.

01:41:11.567 --> 01:41:15.111
Just a little female problem.

01:41:30.253 --> 01:41:32.087
Don't pay any attention.

01:41:32.630 --> 01:41:34.632
It's a cheap trick.

01:41:34.925 --> 01:41:38.261
Anybody can do it.
I taught it to them myself.

01:41:39.304 --> 01:41:41.764
Ungrateful little bitches, aren't they?

01:41:42.432 --> 01:41:45.768
I want to ask you something.
You all go to church.

01:41:46.103 --> 01:41:52.525
Do you think God knew what he
was doing when he created woman?

01:41:52.693 --> 01:41:54.986
No shit! I really want to know.

01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:58.447
Or do you think it was
one of his minor mistakes?

01:41:58.657 --> 01:42:02.118
Like tidal waves! Earthquakes! Floods!

01:42:03.662 --> 01:42:05.997
Do you think women are like that?

01:42:23.307 --> 01:42:24.932
What's the matter?

01:42:27.644 --> 01:42:30.313
You don't think God makes mistakes?

01:42:32.482 --> 01:42:34.317
Of course he does.

01:42:34.818 --> 01:42:36.986
We all make mistakes.

01:42:39.657 --> 01:42:42.826
Of course, we make mistakes,
they call it evil.

01:42:43.536 --> 01:42:48.498
When God makes mistakes,
they call it nature.

01:42:51.336 --> 01:42:53.003
So what do you think?

01:42:53.212 --> 01:42:56.048
Women. A mistake?

01:42:56.883 --> 01:43:01.178
Or did he do it to us on purpose?

01:43:01.346 --> 01:43:03.347
I really want to know!

01:43:03.514 --> 01:43:07.059
If it's a mistake, maybe we can
do something about it!

01:43:07.352 --> 01:43:09.186
Find a cure!

01:43:10.521 --> 01:43:12.356
Invent a vaccine.

01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:17.486
Build up our immune systems.

01:43:21.699 --> 01:43:25.285
Get a little exercise.

01:43:27.038 --> 01:43:29.873
You know. Twenty pushups a day...

01:43:30.041 --> 01:43:34.878
...and you never have to be afflicted
with women, ever again!

01:44:07.079 --> 01:44:08.788
All right, that's it.

01:44:09.415 --> 01:44:11.082
How do we know it worked?

01:44:11.417 --> 01:44:13.751
I guess we just wait and see.

01:44:15.254 --> 01:44:17.588
My God, look at this place.

01:44:19.633 --> 01:44:21.509
- Just in case.
- Okay.

01:45:36.961 --> 01:45:38.295
No!

01:46:09.411 --> 01:46:11.371
Here, here. Quick. Okay.

01:48:01.984 --> 01:48:03.318
The doll.

01:48:27.218 --> 01:48:29.552
Jane! Jane.

01:48:32.515 --> 01:48:34.182
Jane, laugh!

01:51:36.577 --> 01:51:38.077
Come here, you.

01:51:43.041 --> 01:51:47.879
Come on, sweet pea, come on.

01:51:48.046 --> 01:51:51.632
Come on, little mookie boy, come on.

01:51:57.890 --> 01:52:00.641
What a big guy! Sweetheart.

01:52:02.394 --> 01:52:05.563
Look at Fidel.
What does he have for you?

01:52:26.919 --> 01:52:28.252
Janey, stop it.

01:52:28.962 --> 01:52:30.254
What?

01:52:30.589 --> 01:52:32.048
Just stop it.

01:52:32.758 --> 01:52:34.800
I can think about him if I want to.

01:52:34.968 --> 01:52:36.761
Not when we're all together.

01:52:36.929 --> 01:52:38.888
I miss him. I can't help it.

01:52:39.097 --> 01:52:41.015
I do, and so do you. Admit it.

01:52:41.183 --> 01:52:42.767
Okay, we admit it.

01:52:42.976 --> 01:52:44.644
Do you want him back?

01:53:39.826 --> 01:53:41.326
Take it easy.

01:53:41.494 --> 01:53:44.997
We don't want the whole household
in here, do we?

01:53:45.498 --> 01:53:47.499
That's it. Good boys.

01:53:47.709 --> 01:53:50.043
We're going to do just fine.

01:53:51.879 --> 01:53:55.215
Come to Daddy and give me a big kiss.

01:53:55.383 --> 01:53:58.635
Come on. Good boys. Come on.

01:53:58.845 --> 01:54:00.887
Come to Daddy.

01:54:01.055 --> 01:54:05.601
Coochie-coochie-coo.
That's it. Come on.

01:54:05.810 --> 01:54:08.020
Come on. Come on.

01:54:14.570 --> 01:54:17.530
Oh, ladies, come on.
