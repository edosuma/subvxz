00:12.137 --> 00:14.305
Corrections officer:
Alright, 640, you're out.

00:15.223 --> 00:16.307
Come on. Let's go.

00:19.894 --> 00:20.019
Let's go!

00:38.246 --> 00:39.414
Walk.

00:56.306 --> 00:56.890
Pod 640.

01:04.022 --> 01:04.981
Corrections officer:
Move.

01:42.101 --> 01:42.644
Commissary worker:
Is that it?

01:42.727 --> 01:43.853
Uh, yes, I think so.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.980
-Yes, or you think so?
-Uh, yes.

01:46.064 --> 01:48.900
Commissary worker:
Your balance is 345--

01:48.983 --> 01:49.567
Oh, sorry.
Thank you.

01:52.695 --> 01:54.656
How could you do that to me?
You just fucked me!

02:17.220 --> 02:18.721
Motherfucker!

02:23.601 --> 02:24.519
I'll kill you!

02:24.602 --> 02:27.063
I'll fucking kill you!

02:31.526 --> 02:33.069
Michael
Peterson 640.

03:10.481 --> 03:12.859
You know why he
jacked you up, right?

03:13.860 --> 03:15.403
No.

03:15.486 --> 03:17.822
He was waiting on a single cell
for five years.

03:17.906 --> 03:19.908
Was next on the list,
and they gave it to you

03:19.991 --> 03:21.284
because you're famous.

03:22.452 --> 03:23.244
Bell.

03:23.328 --> 03:24.412
Lock-in time!

03:24.495 --> 03:25.872
See you around,
Staircase.

03:28.416 --> 03:30.251
Close her.

03:48.019 --> 03:49.896
Sophie
Dear Michael,

03:49.979 --> 03:51.731
an old friend
visited last week

03:51.814 --> 03:54.275
dying to see the Louvre.

03:54.359 --> 03:56.152
Walking through
the museum reminded me

03:56.235 --> 03:58.738
that you don't have
the luxury of relaxing

03:58.821 --> 04:00.990
while you wait
for your appeal.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.117
Our deadline is tight.

04:03.201 --> 04:05.870
Trust that we are working
as fast as we can

04:05.954 --> 04:08.665
to get your story
in front of the world

04:08.748 --> 04:11.834
and finally get you
the trial you so deserve.

04:14.963 --> 04:17.590
In the meantime,
you said the prison library

04:17.674 --> 04:18.800
wasn't stimulating.

04:18.883 --> 04:22.428
So here's a little something
to get your brain working.

04:23.221 --> 04:24.806
Fondly, Sophie.

06:16.000 --> 06:16.250
Café?

06:49.992 --> 06:51.160
Just look at
my fucking face, David.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.286
David
I hear you, Mike, I--

06:52.370 --> 06:54.080
-No, I, I don't...
-I hear you.

06:54.163 --> 06:55.373
I don't need you
to hear anything.

06:55.456 --> 06:55.957
I just need you
to look at it.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.291
The longer I'm in here,

06:57.375 --> 06:59.335
the more likely it is
I'm going to get killed.

07:01.879 --> 07:02.380
When will we know
about our appeal?

07:04.090 --> 07:04.799
Mike, you know I don't know.

07:04.882 --> 07:06.008
It could be tomorrow.

07:06.092 --> 07:09.303
It could be three months.

07:09.387 --> 07:11.264
So, three months.
Th-that-that's how long

07:11.347 --> 07:12.390
I've got to survive?

07:12.473 --> 07:14.058
Uh...

07:14.142 --> 07:15.977
I'd be shocked if it went
longer than that. Sure.

07:16.060 --> 07:17.353
I-I-I'm not supposed
to be here.

07:17.436 --> 07:20.314
I mean, th-this wasn't
supposed to happen.

07:20.398 --> 07:21.983
This, this wasn't
supposed to be.

07:23.025 --> 07:25.111
Mike, I know.
I know.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.158
Bill
Our appeal contests the seizure

07:30.241 --> 07:31.492
of Michael's computer.

07:31.576 --> 07:34.370
It was unconstitutional.

07:34.453 --> 07:36.831
Without that, the State
would have no grounds

07:36.914 --> 07:39.375
to bring in the emails,
the, the escorts.

07:41.085 --> 07:42.545
Oh yeah.
We're, we're quite confident.

07:45.548 --> 07:46.841
Yeah.

07:46.924 --> 07:48.092
Of course, you can quote me.

07:48.176 --> 07:48.968
I hope you'll quote me.

07:49.051 --> 07:51.012
That's, that's why
I called you back.

07:52.096 --> 07:53.431
-Sell.
-The whole set?

07:56.100 --> 07:57.393
Mom loved them.

08:05.193 --> 08:06.527
How's work?

08:06.611 --> 08:09.071
What do those
movie people have you doing?

08:09.155 --> 08:10.198
You know,
just entry-level stuff,

08:10.281 --> 08:13.367
answering calls,
scheduling.

08:13.451 --> 08:15.536
But they, uh, they hired
their last editor

08:15.620 --> 08:16.704
out of admin, so...

08:16.787 --> 08:18.039
Hmm.

08:18.122 --> 08:19.081
Clayton
You like LA?

08:20.124 --> 08:20.583
Margaret
It's fine.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.212
The people are nicer
than you think.

08:26.172 --> 08:27.715
Reno's just
a day away from you.

08:27.798 --> 08:29.759
Martha, too.

08:29.842 --> 08:32.345
You're welcome any time
you guys need a break.

08:32.428 --> 08:33.930
Not sure Martha's boss
would let her have a day off.

08:34.013 --> 08:35.973
Where's she at now?

08:36.057 --> 08:37.475
Some customer service thing.

08:42.730 --> 08:44.398
-What?

08:44.482 --> 08:46.067
Martha's not really...

08:46.150 --> 08:47.068
-Service oriented.
-...pleasant.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.071
-She's--
-Todd Hey, hey.

08:50.154 --> 08:52.490
-Hey!
-Clayton/Hey!

08:52.573 --> 08:53.491
You made it.

08:55.034 --> 08:56.285
-Hey, man.
-Hey.

08:57.828 --> 08:58.913
Hey.

08:58.996 --> 08:59.622
Come on, sit down.
Food's warm.

09:00.998 --> 09:02.833
Great.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.752
I'm gonna go pour myself a beer.
Does anyone want one?

09:04.835 --> 09:05.878
I don't think we have any.

09:06.837 --> 09:07.713
I brought some.

09:10.174 --> 09:12.593
-Hey.
-Hey.

09:12.677 --> 09:13.636
I'm making pasta.
You want in?

09:16.264 --> 09:17.932
I just quit my job.

09:18.015 --> 09:19.016
Oh shit.

09:19.100 --> 09:21.811
What happened?

09:21.894 --> 09:26.232
Nothing. I just didn't really
want to be there anymore.

09:27.191 --> 09:29.110
-You okay?
-Sure.

13:11.207 --> 13:11.749
Oh, merde.

13:52.081 --> 13:53.374
Hey, yo, Staircase!

13:53.457 --> 13:54.875
I ain't fucking done
with you, you hear?

13:54.959 --> 13:57.169
You hear me, yeah?
I ain't fucking done with you.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.713
-Corrections officer: Sit down!
-I ain't fucking done with you.

13:59.797 --> 14:01.882
-Sit down!

14:01.966 --> 14:02.925
Take it to your table.

14:07.137 --> 14:08.389
Dear Michael,

14:08.472 --> 14:11.183
I was so happy to receive
your last letter.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.893
As I read it,
I could hear your voice,

14:12.977 --> 14:14.228
which I have become
so familiar with

14:14.311 --> 14:16.855
over the past year.

14:16.939 --> 14:18.566
Which is strange,
since you have no idea

14:18.649 --> 14:21.569
what I look like
or sound like.

14:21.652 --> 14:23.988
What do you hear
when you read my letters?

14:24.071 --> 14:27.741
Brigitte Bardot
or Pepe Le Pew?

14:27.825 --> 14:30.744
Yes, the documentary
is going well,
thank you for asking.

14:30.828 --> 14:32.955
I'm working day and night
to get it finished,

14:33.038 --> 14:35.374
and I remain convinced
that once the world sees it,

14:35.457 --> 14:37.626
it will help your appeal.

14:43.924 --> 14:47.553
You gonna stab me
with that pen, Staircase?

14:51.015 --> 14:52.349
I was thinking
I could just off myself.

14:52.433 --> 14:54.435
Boom, boom, boom.

14:54.518 --> 14:54.768
What do you think?

14:57.146 --> 14:57.813
They'd make me clean it up.

15:02.610 --> 15:05.154
You know
about stamps, right?

15:06.947 --> 15:08.198
They're better than money.

15:09.491 --> 15:11.619
Bring 50 "37s" to the yard,

15:11.702 --> 15:13.579
and we'll take care
of your problem for you.

15:15.414 --> 15:16.832
Or don't. Up to you.

15:40.314 --> 15:42.358
Sorry about
the election, Michael.

15:42.441 --> 15:43.484
You know I voted for you.

15:43.567 --> 15:44.610
Oh, you were the one?

16:05.297 --> 16:08.050
I'm so fucking
disappointed in you.

16:08.133 --> 16:10.386
I can't believe
you opened my mail.

16:10.469 --> 16:12.221
My house, my mail.

16:12.304 --> 16:14.390
And don't change the subject.
This is serious.

16:14.473 --> 16:16.350
Tulane is going to take
your scholarship away.

16:16.433 --> 16:17.476
Well, I'm sorry.

16:17.559 --> 16:18.185
Look, Dad, I'm just,

16:18.268 --> 16:19.853
I'm struggling
at the moment.

16:19.937 --> 16:22.231
Yeah, well, sorry
doesn't cut it, missy!

16:22.314 --> 16:25.192
These grades are,
are laughable!

16:25.275 --> 16:27.194
What the fuck
are you doing down there
in New Orleans anyway?

16:27.277 --> 16:29.154
-Trying to get the most beads?
-Gross. No.

16:29.238 --> 16:30.239
Look, Dad, I really,

16:30.322 --> 16:33.742
I really feel like there's
something wrong with me.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.661
I've, I've always had issues.

16:35.744 --> 16:37.454
My, my friends think that I
have a learning disability--

16:37.538 --> 16:38.789
Margie the Martyr.

16:38.872 --> 16:41.667
That's just
medical jargon for lazy,

16:41.750 --> 16:43.794
which I agree
you've always been.

16:44.628 --> 16:46.588
Why are you being so awful?

16:46.672 --> 16:48.549
-I'm going to call Mom.
I don't...
-Go right ahead.

16:48.632 --> 16:49.967
Kathleen and I are
on the same page.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.468
And guess what?

16:51.552 --> 16:52.845
We're not paying for
your plane ticket home

16:52.928 --> 16:54.012
for Thanksgiving.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.848
Dad, stop.

16:55.931 --> 16:57.433
We need to start saving money
for when they drop

16:57.516 --> 16:58.225
your financial aid.

16:58.308 --> 17:00.018
Are you kidding me?

17:03.564 --> 17:05.482
I hate him.

17:05.566 --> 17:06.358
What did you do this time?

17:06.442 --> 17:08.694
I'm not going home
for Thanksgiving.

17:08.777 --> 17:10.070
He's not getting me
my plane ticket.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.113
Shit.

17:11.196 --> 17:12.906
Was he, like,
normal dad angry

17:12.990 --> 17:15.617
or was it like
spring break angry?

17:15.701 --> 17:17.578
I don't know.
I don't know. He was...

17:18.704 --> 17:19.788
something.

17:19.872 --> 17:20.914
Well, if you're not going,

17:20.998 --> 17:22.833
I'm staying
in San Francisco.

17:48.400 --> 17:52.070
Bill, Bill, we need
to be patient.

17:52.154 --> 17:55.240
The appellate court
has had it for months now.

17:56.825 --> 17:58.076
Look, it's, it's all about

17:58.160 --> 18:00.996
how many appeals were filed
ahead of yours.

18:01.079 --> 18:04.374
Do you think that
there's any chance

18:04.458 --> 18:06.668
that we could expedite
with an oral argument?

18:06.752 --> 18:08.921
Our case is strong.
You said so yourself.

18:09.004 --> 18:10.923
Just sit tight.
This is going to be in
the rearview in no time.

18:11.006 --> 18:13.008
I need to get back
to the kids.

18:13.091 --> 18:15.344
Okay.
How are they doing?

18:15.427 --> 18:17.513
You know,
their 60-year-old father

18:17.596 --> 18:19.515
was just brutally assaulted
by a meth head

18:19.598 --> 18:21.099
and thrown into
solitary confinement for a week.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.059
How do you think
they're doing?

18:22.142 --> 18:23.060
I'm doing everything

18:23.143 --> 18:25.270
in my power
to help him, Bill.

18:25.354 --> 18:27.856
And I'm selling
everything the man owned

18:27.940 --> 18:29.233
to keep writing you checks.

18:30.234 --> 18:32.152
So you learning Spanish?

18:32.236 --> 18:34.363
No. No,
you don't really need to.

18:34.446 --> 18:36.698
I mean, Cabo's mostly
resort town.

18:36.782 --> 18:37.032
Lot of Americans.

18:40.410 --> 18:41.995
That's why the timeshare
business is booming.

18:48.752 --> 18:49.711
Here.

18:56.093 --> 18:56.343
The girls, man.

18:59.137 --> 19:00.889
You know, you should
come down sometime.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.267
Nate knows
all the good spots.

19:03.350 --> 19:06.019
Yeah, I don't see Becky
letting me do that.

19:06.103 --> 19:07.771
What do you mean
"letting" you do that?

19:07.855 --> 19:09.231
Just bring her.

19:27.207 --> 19:27.249
Big
Hey.

19:29.793 --> 19:30.919
Get over here.

19:52.149 --> 19:54.693
-Got the stamps?
-Fifty, right?

20:01.867 --> 20:03.076
Yo, Staircase.

20:04.745 --> 20:06.330
What's good?

20:06.413 --> 20:07.205
Hi. Nice to meet you.

20:12.002 --> 20:13.295
Jesus!

20:13.378 --> 20:14.421
He alright?

20:14.504 --> 20:16.173
He's worried you won't
be cool because he's white.

20:18.842 --> 20:21.470
That true?
My skin make you nervous?

20:21.553 --> 20:23.263
What? No.

20:23.347 --> 20:25.766
-Does it make you nervous?
-No, of course not.

20:26.892 --> 20:29.978
I can tell by the way
you said that you're lying.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.772
-I don't like liars.
-I'm not. I'm just, uh...

20:31.855 --> 20:33.398
I, I don't know
how things work.

20:34.566 --> 20:34.983
Hey, we ain't got
a problem taking

20:35.067 --> 20:37.152
a white guy's money.

20:37.235 --> 20:38.445
Unless you're
in the Brotherhood.

20:38.528 --> 20:39.821
You're not a Nazi,
huh, Staircase?

20:39.905 --> 20:40.948
No, of course not.

20:41.031 --> 20:42.282
I voted for Gore.

20:43.408 --> 20:44.993
"Voted for Gore."

20:46.078 --> 20:48.580
Alright, man, we all set.

20:48.664 --> 20:50.582
Hit me up every Monday,
you stay set.

20:51.708 --> 20:54.294
You ain't got to worry
about that crackhead no more.

20:58.215 --> 20:59.383
Alright, man.

21:07.557 --> 21:09.226
Big
Hey.

21:13.146 --> 21:14.147
You lift?

21:16.191 --> 21:17.734
Dear Sophie,

21:17.818 --> 21:19.152
despite my doubts
about a higher power,

21:21.446 --> 21:23.281
my hands are clasped
in prayer for you

21:23.365 --> 21:25.367
to get the documentary out
sooner rather than later.

21:28.078 --> 21:30.580
My appeal is set
to be decided on

21:30.664 --> 21:32.874
in less than three months.

21:32.958 --> 21:35.002
I always felt the documentary
was the best way

21:35.085 --> 21:36.962
for people to hear
my side of the story.

21:38.213 --> 21:41.717
I feel I must ask a question
that is long overdue.

21:41.800 --> 21:44.386
Why on earth are you
still writing to me?

21:45.554 --> 21:46.722
You're a smart,
accomplished woman

21:46.805 --> 21:49.224
in the prime of her life

21:49.307 --> 21:51.351
who sounds surprisingly
like Pepe Le Pew.

21:52.102 --> 21:54.146
And I'm a convicted criminal

21:54.229 --> 21:55.981
waiting for some
assholes in black robes

21:56.064 --> 21:58.066
to admit mistakes were made
and free me.

21:59.901 --> 22:01.445
The fractured cartilage

22:01.528 --> 22:04.656
in Kathleen's thyroid
indicates

22:04.740 --> 22:07.617
a strangulation
attempt is...

22:08.660 --> 22:10.412
merely possible.

22:10.495 --> 22:13.040
Dr.
I would say it was
highly, highly likely

22:13.123 --> 22:15.667
an attempt
at strangulation was made.

22:15.751 --> 22:17.169
But can you say that

22:17.252 --> 22:19.921
with a reasonable degree

22:20.005 --> 22:21.339
of medical certainty?

22:23.258 --> 22:24.509
Yes. Yes, I can.

23:22.484 --> 23:23.777
Of course, I miss her.

23:25.153 --> 23:27.989
I miss seeing her face
every morning.

23:28.073 --> 23:29.116
I miss her laughing
at my jokes,

23:29.199 --> 23:31.284
even when
they weren't funny.

23:31.368 --> 23:33.912
What can I do about it,
you know?

23:34.704 --> 23:37.999
Her being gone
and this trial,

23:39.209 --> 23:40.585
I can't change any of it.

23:42.462 --> 23:44.089
I'm worried about you.

23:45.757 --> 23:48.385
A great deal
of selfishness and ego

23:49.511 --> 23:51.972
goes away with age.

23:52.055 --> 23:53.098
You can't help it,
you know.

23:53.181 --> 23:56.810
You watch yourself get old
and fat and stupid.

23:56.893 --> 23:59.521
And so you worry
about other things.

24:02.232 --> 24:04.025
Other people.

24:04.109 --> 24:04.442
Those you love.

24:06.444 --> 24:07.320
Like you guys.

24:31.761 --> 24:33.930
-Kathleen.
-Carol.

24:34.014 --> 24:35.182
Hi. Hi!

24:35.265 --> 24:36.808
I can't believe this.

24:36.892 --> 24:38.852
I was just talking
about you last night.

24:38.935 --> 24:41.104
-Oh.
I was telling my friends

24:41.188 --> 24:42.814
how you set me free.

24:43.940 --> 24:45.066
Aw.

24:46.109 --> 24:48.820
Oh. Okay.

24:48.904 --> 24:50.447
Oh man,
it is good to see you.

24:50.530 --> 24:52.532
You too.
You look good.

24:52.616 --> 24:54.409
Yeah, I am good.

24:54.492 --> 24:57.746
-Where are you working now?
-Bowman and Girard.

24:57.829 --> 24:58.580
It's a mid-sized firm
downtown.

25:01.458 --> 25:02.709
Money's good?

25:02.792 --> 25:03.418
Not great.

25:03.501 --> 25:05.295
About little more
than half

25:05.378 --> 25:06.504
of what I was making.

25:06.588 --> 25:07.297
But it's fine.

25:07.380 --> 25:09.883
The hours are
completely humane.

25:14.971 --> 25:17.557
You know, when I took
a step back

25:17.641 --> 25:19.226
away from it all,

25:19.309 --> 25:22.771
I can see I was really,
really struggling at Nortel.

25:26.524 --> 25:28.318
But it used
to be fun, right?

25:28.401 --> 25:30.403
I mean... it was work,

25:30.487 --> 25:32.906
but we were doing
pretty well.

25:32.989 --> 25:34.324
Yeah.

25:36.409 --> 25:36.534
Then it changed.

25:38.578 --> 25:42.415
Now, I can actually
see my kids.

25:42.499 --> 25:44.292
We've even got
a Club Med trip planned.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.086
Turks and Caicos.

25:46.169 --> 25:47.921
-Can you believe it?
-Oh, that's great, Carol.

25:48.004 --> 25:50.465
That's... it's really great.

26:23.915 --> 26:26.126
Hi.

26:26.209 --> 26:28.211
Hi. Um, this is
a family heirloom.

26:28.295 --> 26:30.672
I'm sorry,
it's not for sale.

26:31.631 --> 26:33.466
I'm sorry.

26:33.550 --> 26:35.635
Larry.
You should have called, Larry.

26:35.719 --> 26:37.470
We would have
let you in first.

26:37.554 --> 26:38.471
Oh, that's okay.

26:38.555 --> 26:39.014
Didn't want to be a bother.

26:39.097 --> 26:41.641
But weren't there two?

26:41.725 --> 26:43.184
-Two what?
-Deer.

26:43.268 --> 26:45.312
Uh, to be honest,
I have no idea.

26:45.395 --> 26:46.479
Well, how much you want
for this bad boy?

26:46.563 --> 26:47.188
-Oh no, no, no, no.
-Nonsense.

26:47.272 --> 26:49.190
Michael needs the money.

26:49.899 --> 26:52.736
Let's call it...
a hundred.

26:54.904 --> 26:56.698
Thank you.

26:56.781 --> 26:58.533
Remember, I'm right
next door if you need me.

27:00.160 --> 27:01.995
Oh, come on.

27:03.371 --> 27:05.498
-I'm retired now.
-Oh.

27:06.541 --> 27:07.792
Got nothing but time.

27:11.421 --> 27:13.340
So, for my peace of mind,

27:13.423 --> 27:14.716
I need someone dedicated

27:14.799 --> 27:17.385
to making the commissary
deposits every week.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.137
It's, it's all my food,

27:19.220 --> 27:21.348
uh, writing materials, stamps.

27:21.431 --> 27:23.016
-It's, it's everything.
-I can take over.

27:23.099 --> 27:24.476
No, I've got it.

27:24.559 --> 27:26.186
I've done it
the past six months.
It's fine.

27:26.269 --> 27:27.854
Yeah. But you're in Mexico,
and I'm in the states.
It's easier.

27:27.937 --> 27:29.189
You know they have
banks in Mexico.

27:29.272 --> 27:30.190
I'm just trying
to give you a break.

27:30.273 --> 27:31.358
Let's just say it's Todd, okay.

27:31.441 --> 27:33.360
It's Todd.
You get the dogs.

27:33.443 --> 27:34.652
I hate
those fucking dogs.

27:38.239 --> 27:39.616
You know, Bill's expecting
a good haul

27:39.699 --> 27:41.618
from the estate sale.

27:41.701 --> 27:43.370
And the house?
Any interest?

27:44.788 --> 27:45.789
Uh...

27:47.499 --> 27:48.458
we're less optimistic there.

27:48.541 --> 27:50.835
What's that supposed
to mean?

27:52.379 --> 27:54.589
It, it's looking like it's going
to go for less than asking.

27:54.672 --> 27:56.174
What, like a million?

28:01.471 --> 28:05.558
More like...
seven-fifty. Seven.

28:05.642 --> 28:07.352
Seven?
Are you kidding me?

28:07.435 --> 28:10.063
It's got six
fucking bathrooms!
Why?

28:12.232 --> 28:13.775
Because of what
happened in there.

28:15.777 --> 28:17.570
So I'm going to be broke
when I get out of here.

28:17.654 --> 28:19.697
-Yo, man,

28:19.781 --> 28:20.323
I don't have
to fucking be here!

28:20.407 --> 28:22.867
Man
Okay, okay.

28:22.951 --> 28:24.035
I fucking don't.

28:24.119 --> 28:25.453
-This is horrible.
-Clay.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.038
It is. I don't know
how I survived--

28:27.122 --> 28:28.123
You only did four years.

28:28.206 --> 28:28.915
-I know.
-And you were guilty.

28:28.998 --> 28:30.834
Sorry.

28:31.835 --> 28:33.002
Sorry. I'm just...

28:34.170 --> 28:36.005
I'm just upset
about losing the house.

31:58.916 --> 32:02.086
Okay. Slower still, yes?

33:12.198 --> 33:12.949
Thoughts?

33:14.283 --> 33:15.910
Notes?

33:18.705 --> 33:20.790
One more time, please.

33:47.650 --> 33:49.861
Dear Michael,

33:49.944 --> 33:51.738
I've so enjoyed
our correspondence.

33:51.821 --> 33:52.029
Perhaps too much.

33:54.490 --> 33:55.992
Because of that,
I need distance,

33:56.075 --> 33:59.287
and I will be taking
a break from writing you.

33:59.996 --> 34:02.874
I hope you understand.

34:02.957 --> 34:05.418
To keep you occupied, I'm
sending along another book,

34:05.501 --> 34:06.794
since you're sticking
to your lie

34:06.878 --> 34:08.755
that you finished Proust.

34:08.838 --> 34:09.922
It was my favorite
as a young girl.

34:11.048 --> 34:14.343
But I haven't read it
in years.

34:14.427 --> 34:16.304
I'm hoping you can read it
and then tell me

34:16.387 --> 34:17.764
if it's as good
as I remember.

34:17.847 --> 34:20.475
I fear my memory
has distorted

34:20.558 --> 34:22.435
my perception of it.

34:22.518 --> 34:25.062
Hopefully, you can tell me
I'm wrong.

34:25.146 --> 34:25.938
Fondly, Sophie.

34:31.194 --> 34:33.154
Dear Sophie,
I'm sad to know

34:33.237 --> 34:33.696
you can't write me
for a time.

34:33.780 --> 34:36.407
But I understand.

34:36.491 --> 34:38.659
I know how complicated
life can be.

34:38.743 --> 34:39.952
I felt I had to respond

34:40.036 --> 34:41.662
to thank you
for the book, though.

34:41.746 --> 34:44.582
It was also one of my
favorites when I was young.

34:44.665 --> 34:47.126
I've often felt like Alice
during this whole ordeal.

34:47.210 --> 34:50.755
Like I've gone through
the looking glass.

34:50.838 --> 34:53.382
And prison is every bit
the hell it's made out to be.

34:53.466 --> 34:54.842
Worse than war.

34:54.926 --> 34:57.345
Hell, war was even
fun sometimes.

34:57.428 --> 34:59.472
But it's full
of interesting people

34:59.555 --> 35:02.600
who can be funny,
gentle, loyal.

35:02.683 --> 35:04.393
It's hard to square up with
what I know they've done.

35:04.477 --> 35:06.437
Corrections officer:
Head count, gentlemen.

35:07.897 --> 35:09.732
Let's go, gentlemen.

35:09.816 --> 35:11.442
It'll make
for a good novel one day.

35:12.443 --> 35:15.279
I can feel my imagination
turning on

35:15.822 --> 35:17.657
thanks to you.

35:20.618 --> 35:22.829
I've actually been thinking
a lot about Paris lately.

35:22.912 --> 35:25.456
Closing my eyes
and imagining

35:25.540 --> 35:27.834
this little cafe
Kathleen and I used
to frequent in the 4th.

35:27.917 --> 35:31.212
La Reine Rouge.
Do you know it?

35:31.295 --> 35:32.839
When I win my appeal,
I would like nothing more

35:32.922 --> 35:34.090
than to go there with you.

35:37.426 --> 35:41.681
We could sit, have a glass
of wine, and people watch.

35:42.682 --> 35:45.768
I feel like
you'd enjoy that too.

35:45.852 --> 35:49.730
You documentary subject
and hopefully one day, friend,

35:50.565 --> 35:51.691
Michael Peterson.

36:04.954 --> 36:06.622
Oh, merci.

36:15.923 --> 36:17.758
Can you say that
with reasonable degree

36:17.842 --> 36:20.303
of medical certainty?

36:20.386 --> 36:20.803
Dr.
Yes. Yes, I can.

36:20.887 --> 36:22.555
Okay.

36:23.806 --> 36:25.266
Et voilà...

37:06.265 --> 37:07.475
Clayton?

37:49.600 --> 37:51.394
Oh!

39:23.360 --> 39:26.489
It's too hot outside
for that shit.

39:28.574 --> 39:32.036
You girls were really
something tonight. Come on in.

39:32.119 --> 39:34.538
Oh, can't stop,
won't stop.

39:35.331 --> 39:36.290
Okay.

39:36.373 --> 39:37.625
Come on in.
We'll show you the place.

39:37.708 --> 39:38.334
I like it.
I like it.

39:40.002 --> 39:40.920
2,400 square feet.

39:41.003 --> 39:43.005
Brand new construction.

39:43.089 --> 39:45.049
A tub you could drown in.

39:45.132 --> 39:47.176
And fuck me...

39:48.094 --> 39:49.095
the pool.

39:49.178 --> 39:50.721
It's a goddamn work of art.

39:52.014 --> 39:53.974
You ladies...

39:54.058 --> 39:55.643
yeah, you'd look
pretty good next to it.

39:55.726 --> 39:56.102
Hmm. Hmm.

40:40.896 --> 40:42.231
When you come to Cabo...

40:43.607 --> 40:44.817
no one knows who you are.

40:44.900 --> 40:45.818
You can do anything you want.

40:45.901 --> 40:47.069
It's fantastic.

40:49.155 --> 40:51.991
Well, my family's been
vacationing here for years,

40:52.074 --> 40:55.327
so everybody knows us.

40:55.411 --> 40:58.330
Well, that's exactly why
you need this place.

40:58.414 --> 41:00.708
And I-I'm telling you,
we could have you

41:00.791 --> 41:01.834
in this condo by Monday.

41:01.917 --> 41:03.419
Oh, easily.

41:03.502 --> 41:05.045
Keys in hand.
Done, yours.

41:05.129 --> 41:07.339
That is crazy.

41:07.423 --> 41:10.843
Real estate takes
forever in Boston.

41:10.926 --> 41:12.011
Well, you know...

41:14.096 --> 41:16.015
things are faster down here.

41:16.098 --> 41:18.017
Uh, ten rolls
of stamps, please.

41:18.100 --> 41:19.351
-Commissary worker:
Any stationery?
-Uh, not today. No.

41:19.435 --> 41:22.438
Oh, and one of those
honey buns, actually.

41:22.521 --> 41:24.773
-Alright.

41:25.983 --> 41:27.526
Try again next week.

41:27.943 --> 41:29.028
Try again?

41:29.111 --> 41:31.614
-No money, no order.
-What?

41:31.697 --> 41:33.032
There's no money
in your account.

41:33.115 --> 41:35.451
No, my son Todd puts,
puts money in every week.

41:35.534 --> 41:38.412
-Just look again.
-Why would I look again
when there's nothing to see?

41:38.495 --> 41:39.455
Check next week.

41:39.538 --> 41:40.915
You don't understand.
I need this.

41:40.998 --> 41:41.498
I really need this.

41:41.582 --> 41:42.208
Step out of line, 640.

41:42.291 --> 41:43.375
-Please, I don't...
-Now.

41:43.459 --> 41:45.419
-No, I need this!
-Step out of line now!

41:45.502 --> 41:47.713
-- Hey, Staircase.
-Inmate- Hey.

41:57.181 --> 42:00.434
Hey, BK.
How's it going?

42:00.518 --> 42:01.393
Chillin'.
You seem hyped though.

42:03.229 --> 42:04.939
I don't have the stamps.

42:05.022 --> 42:07.191
Not today.

42:09.193 --> 42:09.527
Soon.

42:11.487 --> 42:12.571
I see.

42:14.323 --> 42:17.076
I just need one more day.
That's all.

42:17.993 --> 42:20.079
I need the stamps,

42:20.162 --> 42:21.080
or J-Smoke gonna fuck
your ass up.

42:21.163 --> 42:23.499
This ain't
no damn charity.

42:24.416 --> 42:25.793
Start the game over.

42:30.339 --> 42:31.840
So my son forgot.

42:34.134 --> 42:35.636
He didn't put money in the...

42:46.814 --> 42:47.815
It's a free country.

42:48.857 --> 42:50.359
Stand where you got
to stand.

42:51.402 --> 42:52.486
Thank you.

43:23.976 --> 43:25.686
Fuck! Fuck!

43:28.105 --> 43:29.106
Oh shit!

43:29.732 --> 43:30.649
Oh shit!

43:32.109 --> 43:33.319
Oh my god.

43:36.697 --> 43:38.449
Pick up, Nate.
Pick up, Nate.

43:38.532 --> 43:39.992
-Fuck!

43:41.618 --> 43:43.579
Fuck!

43:55.174 --> 43:57.760
Dude. What happened
last night?

43:58.802 --> 43:59.636
Are you joking?

44:03.390 --> 44:05.309
There's blood.

44:05.392 --> 44:06.393
Goddamn it, dude.

44:06.477 --> 44:08.687
You fucked up
the whole deal.

44:08.771 --> 44:10.689
Nate, Nate,
what happened to the girl?

44:10.773 --> 44:12.524
-What girl?
-The one that I was, um,

44:12.608 --> 44:14.568
that I was hanging with,
the girl with the pink bra.

44:14.651 --> 44:18.405
What? She left
right after you fell

44:18.489 --> 44:20.657
and hit your head
or something.

44:20.741 --> 44:21.617
You better not have
fucked the place up.

44:28.040 --> 44:30.125
Yo, Todd.

44:32.711 --> 44:34.922
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. So she's okay?

44:35.005 --> 44:38.133
Whatever. She's got
a massive fucking hangover.

44:38.217 --> 44:42.221
But... look, bro,

44:42.304 --> 44:44.181
you need to lock
your shit down.

44:44.264 --> 44:45.391
Otherwise, we're gonna
have to rethink

44:45.474 --> 44:47.851
this whole
business arrangement.

44:47.935 --> 44:49.645
And I set my account
to auto-pay, so it'll
never happen again.

44:49.728 --> 44:51.105
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

44:51.188 --> 44:53.482
Yeah, of course, Dad.

44:54.983 --> 44:56.402
What the hell happened
with Todd?

44:56.485 --> 44:57.861
It's not like him.

44:57.945 --> 44:59.279
I don't know,
he must be really busy

44:59.363 --> 45:00.572
with his real estate thing.

45:00.656 --> 45:02.574
He says it's going
really well.

45:02.658 --> 45:03.659
Oh, good for him.

45:07.746 --> 45:09.415
Hey. Dad.

45:11.500 --> 45:14.878
It's just...
this is a lot.

45:20.676 --> 45:22.970
I wasn't going to mention this
until things were...

45:23.053 --> 45:25.848
What? Oh god, what?
What? What is it?

45:25.931 --> 45:27.808
No, it's, it's good.
Becky's pregnant.

45:29.143 --> 45:31.103
Oh.

45:32.688 --> 45:33.605
Oh.

45:34.189 --> 45:36.024
Oh wow.

45:37.192 --> 45:39.069
You're going to be
a grandfather.

45:43.490 --> 45:43.615
Come here.

45:48.912 --> 45:50.622
Alright, 640,
make space.

45:57.671 --> 45:57.713
Um...

45:59.256 --> 46:01.633
well, I, uh,

46:01.717 --> 46:04.011
I hope my appeal
comes through
be-before he's born.

46:04.094 --> 46:06.305
You know, I want
to be there for you.

46:09.349 --> 46:10.809
Well, David says any day now.

46:13.562 --> 46:14.688
And we think it's going
to be a she.

46:16.273 --> 46:18.150
A she?

46:18.233 --> 46:19.401
Oh wow.
Now girls are a handful.

46:19.485 --> 46:21.320
You know that, don't you?

46:21.403 --> 46:22.654
Yeah, that's...

46:22.738 --> 46:23.906
...that's what
I keep hearing.

46:23.989 --> 46:25.866
Yeah.

46:25.949 --> 46:27.451
Oh my god.

46:27.534 --> 46:30.078
Whoa, whoa, Margaret,
what are you talking about?

46:30.162 --> 46:30.996
Dad didn't tell you?

46:31.079 --> 46:32.372
I thought you were
on the same page.

46:32.456 --> 46:35.542
Wait. Wait.
What happened?

46:35.626 --> 46:36.502
He went through my mail,

46:36.585 --> 46:38.712
found out I got
some bad grades,

46:38.795 --> 46:40.172
and flipped out,
that's what happened.

46:40.255 --> 46:41.840
He told me
you weren't going

46:41.924 --> 46:43.550
to buy me a ticket home
for Thanksgiving.

46:43.634 --> 46:45.010
So, I'm not coming.

46:45.093 --> 46:46.845
Well, no...

46:46.929 --> 46:48.347
I can give you
the money for a ticket.

46:48.430 --> 46:49.681
Mike doesn't need to know.

46:49.765 --> 46:51.433
It's too late.
I made other plans.

46:51.517 --> 46:52.643
With who?

46:52.726 --> 46:54.228
I'm going
to Aunt Blair's.

46:54.311 --> 46:55.354
Aunt Blair's?

46:55.437 --> 46:56.730
Oh, come on, you do not want
to go to Rhode Island.

46:56.813 --> 46:58.690
Whatever.
I, I've got to study.

46:58.774 --> 47:01.985
I'll see you at Christmas,
if I'm invited.

47:03.362 --> 47:05.072
Kathleen.

47:05.948 --> 47:07.574
Your table's ready.

47:07.658 --> 47:09.117
-Oh.
-It's been too long.

47:09.201 --> 47:10.953
George,
so good to see you.

47:11.036 --> 47:11.745
She really did seem lighter

47:11.828 --> 47:13.539
not working
at Nortel, you know.

47:13.622 --> 47:15.123
There was
a brightness to her.

47:15.207 --> 47:17.876
-Good for her.
-Check in with her
in six months.

47:19.294 --> 47:22.714
-What does that mean?
-Well, she's, um,

47:22.798 --> 47:24.716
she'll be tearing
her hair out with boredom.

47:24.800 --> 47:26.385
She's addicted
to the grind.

47:26.468 --> 47:27.511
Another bottle?

47:28.262 --> 47:30.514
It's pricey.

47:30.597 --> 47:32.349
You really think you have
everyone's number, don't you?

47:32.432 --> 47:33.934
I mean,
I think I got Carol's.

47:35.102 --> 47:35.852
I'd love for someone
to take the wheel.

47:37.813 --> 47:39.606
Have an easier job.
No job.

47:39.690 --> 47:42.192
What are you talking about?

47:42.276 --> 47:43.360
You're a workaholic, too.

47:43.443 --> 47:45.070
What would you even do?

47:45.153 --> 47:47.239
Uh, go fishing more,
for starters.

47:47.322 --> 47:48.615
Uh, no, you wouldn't.

47:48.699 --> 47:50.242
Everything okay,
Mr. Peterson?

47:50.325 --> 47:51.910
Yes, George. Fantastic.

47:51.994 --> 47:54.204
Um, another Sancerre.

47:54.288 --> 47:55.372
Fine choice, Mr. Peterson.

47:57.082 --> 47:58.750
Oh, Kathleen,
I've been meaning to tell you.

47:58.834 --> 48:01.211
We're going to my sister's
for Thanksgiving.

48:01.295 --> 48:03.130
So thank you
for the invitation, but...

48:03.213 --> 48:04.881
Maybe just I can come?

48:04.965 --> 48:08.010
Well, I'm thinking of sitting
this year out, actually.

48:09.094 --> 48:09.970
Oh really?

48:10.053 --> 48:11.972
Yes, Kathleen,
do say more.

48:12.055 --> 48:14.891
Well, some of the kids
aren't coming home.

48:14.975 --> 48:15.767
Who?

48:16.602 --> 48:19.896
Don't you look so surprised.

48:19.980 --> 48:21.607
Margaret.

48:21.690 --> 48:23.442
She's going to Rhode Island
to be with Aunt Blair.

48:23.525 --> 48:25.319
Aunt Blair?

48:25.402 --> 48:27.195
Jesus, that kid's
a glutton for punishment.

48:27.779 --> 48:29.281
What about Martha?

48:30.115 --> 48:31.825
She hasn't picked up
her phone.

48:33.493 --> 48:35.746
I'm sorry, honey.

48:35.829 --> 48:37.914
I know how important
Thanksgiving is to you.

48:37.998 --> 48:40.125
No, it's okay.

48:40.208 --> 48:42.377
My sister's been begging
to host for a decade,

48:42.461 --> 48:46.131
so I might just take a page
out of the Carol playbook

48:46.214 --> 48:47.466
and take the night off.

48:51.762 --> 48:56.141
Hey. A toast to giving
ourselves a break.

48:56.224 --> 48:58.477
Yeah.
To, uh, what's her name?

48:58.560 --> 49:00.145
-Carol.
-Carol?

49:00.228 --> 49:02.064
-To Carol.
-To Carol.

49:14.910 --> 49:15.744
So, since we're going
to be out of town,

49:15.827 --> 49:17.913
you know what
that means, buddy?

49:17.996 --> 49:19.206
-What?
-You're going to have

49:19.289 --> 49:20.957
-to come over and feed the bats.

49:21.041 --> 49:23.085
Have we told you the latest
with those fucking things?

49:23.168 --> 49:24.920
Who knew they were
so hard to get rid of?

49:25.921 --> 49:27.464
-Hmm?

49:51.238 --> 49:51.947
-Do you mind?
-Hm.

49:57.369 --> 49:58.578
Thanks.

49:58.662 --> 50:01.039
You know, for the assist.

50:01.707 --> 50:02.874
The other day, you know.

50:04.626 --> 50:06.044
Not telling me to scram.

50:11.675 --> 50:13.218
Sorry to hear
what happened.

50:13.301 --> 50:14.720
Oh.

50:14.803 --> 50:16.972
That's all sorted out now,
so I'm...

50:19.766 --> 50:22.519
No, I'm, I'm good
for a while.

50:22.602 --> 50:24.396
You know, my, uh...

50:24.479 --> 50:25.772
my youngest
was busy with work.

50:25.856 --> 50:27.566
And my oldest, Clayton?

50:27.649 --> 50:29.317
I'm going to be
a grandfather.

50:34.489 --> 50:36.575
You're really relaxed.

50:37.909 --> 50:40.495
When I lost,
it took me a minute.

50:43.331 --> 50:44.040
Lost? Lost what?

50:47.502 --> 50:49.421
In October 2003,

50:49.504 --> 50:51.590
novelist Michael Peterson
was convicted

50:51.673 --> 50:52.924
of the murder of his wife,

50:53.008 --> 50:54.843
Nortel executive
Kathleen Peterson.

50:54.926 --> 50:57.637
His defense team
led by David Rudolf

50:57.721 --> 50:59.389
immediately filed
for an appeal.

50:59.473 --> 51:01.725
But today,
a three-judge panel

51:01.808 --> 51:04.603
rejected Peterson's arguments
that his trial was filled

51:04.686 --> 51:06.938
with inflammatory,
irrelevant evidence

51:07.022 --> 51:08.690
and judicial mistakes
that prevented him

51:08.774 --> 51:10.275
from getting a fair trial.

51:10.358 --> 51:14.321
The decision comes nearly
a year after his conviction.

51:14.404 --> 51:16.948
Now, Michael Peterson
and his defense team

51:17.032 --> 51:19.242
are headed to the
North Carolina Supreme Court

51:19.326 --> 51:20.535
where they will have
one final...

51:21.787 --> 51:24.122
So, hang, hang on a second.
Can you hear me?

51:24.206 --> 51:26.416
-Can you hear me?
-Yeah, I can hear you.

51:26.500 --> 51:28.210
Okay. Um, look, Mike,

51:28.293 --> 51:29.628
we obviously didn't want you

51:29.711 --> 51:31.671
to find out
this way, alright?

51:31.755 --> 51:33.006
I'm, I'm sorry.

51:33.089 --> 51:33.632
Oh, you didn't want me
to find out standing

51:33.715 --> 51:35.675
next to Bob the pedophile?

51:35.759 --> 51:37.260
You didn't think that was ideal?

51:37.344 --> 51:38.970
Look, I, I understand
your anger, Mike.

51:39.054 --> 51:43.475
It was one appeal
in a stack of a thousand.

51:43.558 --> 51:45.393
Uh, we didn't know

51:45.477 --> 51:47.646
when we were going to hear,
and we can't exactly just,

51:47.729 --> 51:49.022
you know,
ring your doorbell, so...

51:49.105 --> 51:51.399
What does it say?
What does it say?

51:51.483 --> 51:52.442
The ruling?
Can you send me a copy?

51:52.526 --> 51:54.820
Yeah, we'll send it.
Of course, we'll send it.

51:54.903 --> 51:56.071
It says, you know,
they actually agreed

51:56.154 --> 51:59.199
with our argument
that the state's conduct

51:59.282 --> 52:02.994
in seizing your computer
was unconstitutional.

52:03.078 --> 52:04.329
So why am I
still fucking here?

52:04.412 --> 52:07.624
Because then they ruled
two-to-one that it was...

52:07.707 --> 52:10.335
Immaterial to
the final outcome.

52:10.418 --> 52:12.087
Wait, immaterial to the outcome?

52:12.170 --> 52:13.338
My fucking life.
The outcome?

52:13.421 --> 52:15.048
Tom
Yes. That what they
found on your computer

52:15.131 --> 52:17.759
didn't sway the jury
one way or another.

52:17.843 --> 52:18.844
Well, listen, listen.

52:18.927 --> 52:20.512
Because it was
a split decision,

52:20.595 --> 52:22.055
the appeal
automatically goes up

52:22.138 --> 52:23.515
to the state supreme court.

52:23.598 --> 52:25.642
And our odds are much better
at that level.

52:26.393 --> 52:28.353
So how long will that take?

52:28.436 --> 52:30.313
Well, uh,
could be another year.

52:30.397 --> 52:32.482
-Or... or two.
-Fuck.

52:32.566 --> 52:33.525
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

52:33.608 --> 52:34.901
I know. Well...

52:35.819 --> 52:36.695
I am with you

52:36.778 --> 52:39.030
until this is over.

52:39.698 --> 52:41.741
Right here.

52:42.951 --> 52:44.870
You know that, right?

52:44.953 --> 52:47.497
Come on, I can't get
off this call

52:47.581 --> 52:48.915
if you're mad at me.

52:49.875 --> 52:52.043
No, I'm not mad, Dave.

52:52.127 --> 52:53.837
I, I got to go.

52:53.920 --> 52:55.255
-Alright, uh--

53:11.938 --> 53:12.272
Let me, uh...

53:14.357 --> 53:15.525
let me see if I can get her.

53:15.609 --> 53:16.693
Can you guys...

53:17.652 --> 53:19.112
can you guys hold on?

53:19.195 --> 53:20.488
-- Yeah.
-- Yeah.

53:21.239 --> 53:22.616
I'm here.

53:22.699 --> 53:24.701
Okay, cool. One second.

53:24.784 --> 53:26.286
-You okay, bro?
-Yeah.

53:27.495 --> 53:28.538
Yeah, all good.

53:39.674 --> 53:41.259
Hey.

53:41.343 --> 53:42.636
I can be in
San Francisco tomorrow.

53:42.719 --> 53:44.971
I'm fine.

53:45.972 --> 53:49.559
Okay, let me,
let me loop the boys in.

53:52.020 --> 53:53.939
So what's important
to remember

53:54.022 --> 53:55.148
is that this
isn't the end.

53:55.231 --> 53:56.107
There's going to be
a second appeal.

53:56.191 --> 53:58.777
Is this just going
to go on for years?

53:58.860 --> 54:00.111
It has not been years.

54:00.195 --> 54:03.782
It's been, what,
maybe ten months?

54:03.865 --> 54:06.368
It's been three years
since Mom...

54:12.040 --> 54:14.751
Look, we just need to...
buckle up.

54:14.834 --> 54:17.087
Alright? Refuel.

54:17.170 --> 54:20.298
Right. There's still moves
left on the board.

54:20.924 --> 54:22.258
Yeah. It'll all be fine.

54:24.928 --> 54:25.345
Bonjour.

55:18.064 --> 55:19.774
Um, no.

55:23.611 --> 55:25.780
...one night, she was...

55:25.864 --> 55:27.198
You know, this, this
house is, is filled...

55:29.743 --> 55:31.202
...with so many memories.

55:33.913 --> 55:35.707
You know, I, I feel her here.

55:38.418 --> 55:40.795
I, I just always think

55:40.879 --> 55:43.214
she might walk through
that door any moment.

55:45.216 --> 55:47.594
Smiling, laughing,

55:47.677 --> 55:49.721
reminding me that I'm,
I'm late for something.

57:23.481 --> 57:25.316
Oh!

58:39.766 --> 58:42.018
Hi.

58:42.101 --> 58:43.186
-Oh my god.
-Oh god.

58:43.269 --> 58:44.187
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to...

58:44.270 --> 58:45.355
I got it. I got it.

58:45.438 --> 58:47.190
I got it. I got it.

58:47.273 --> 58:49.609
I didn't mean to scare you.
I, I, uh...

58:49.692 --> 58:51.069
-You're, you're new here, right?
-Uh, yeah, kinda.

58:51.152 --> 58:53.905
Dearest Margaret,

58:53.988 --> 58:55.531
We've never met,
but I spent

58:55.615 --> 58:58.910
many precious hours
with you and your family.

58:58.993 --> 59:02.247
This documentary is
the result of those hours.

59:02.330 --> 59:04.457
We hope we did justice
to your family's story.

59:06.459 --> 59:09.462
Please know that to me,
this is not the end.

59:16.427 --> 59:19.305
Yours truly, Sophie,

59:19.389 --> 59:21.432
editor, Maha Productions.

59:24.644 --> 59:26.062
Corrections officer:
Hey, 640.

59:26.604 --> 59:28.064
Visiting hours.

59:28.773 --> 59:29.941
What?

59:35.947 --> 59:38.741
Staircase.

1:00:16.529 --> 1:00:17.655
Michael.

1:00:21.909 --> 1:00:23.995
Sophie.

1:00:39.427 --> 1:00:41.012
-You're here.

1:00:41.095 --> 1:00:42.680
I am here.

1:00:44.307 --> 1:00:44.724
Yes.

1:00:46.100 --> 1:00:47.435
Wow.
