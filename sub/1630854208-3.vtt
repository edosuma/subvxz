WEBVTT

00:02.570 --> 00:03.871
ROBYN:
I'm the one you call

00:03.971 --> 00:05.206
when you can't call 911.

00:05.306 --> 00:07.007
Previously on
The Equalizer...

00:07.108 --> 00:08.008
ROBYN:
How's it going, Harry?

00:08.109 --> 00:09.343
Enjoying being dead?

00:09.443 --> 00:10.811
HARRY:
I want you to resurrect me.

00:10.911 --> 00:12.180
I just don't want
to keep hiding.

00:12.280 --> 00:13.447
There's something going on

00:13.547 --> 00:15.015
that you both need
to know about.

00:15.116 --> 00:16.384
Mom!

00:18.419 --> 00:19.620
Mom!

00:19.720 --> 00:20.821
Rob!

00:20.921 --> 00:21.755
I can't believe
I let this happen

00:21.855 --> 00:23.724
in front of my family.

00:23.824 --> 00:25.793
I got to get to work.
What's the case?

00:25.893 --> 00:26.894
Is it dangerous?

00:26.994 --> 00:28.196
We deserve a heads-up.

00:28.296 --> 00:29.330
DELILAH:
Mom, I know you're only

00:29.430 --> 00:30.431
checking up on me because

00:30.531 --> 00:31.732
you're worried.

00:31.832 --> 00:34.602
If you really want
to help, train me.

00:38.172 --> 00:40.474
(wind whistling)

00:44.145 --> 00:46.380
(door creaking)

00:48.349 --> 00:50.584
(soft, wooden thudding)

00:54.222 --> 00:56.056
(sighs)

00:56.157 --> 00:58.859
(soft clacking continues)

00:58.959 --> 01:01.262
(wind whistling)

01:01.362 --> 01:05.599
What the hell?
I know I locked these.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.704
Kaylee.

01:10.804 --> 01:12.673
Kaylee?

01:13.341 --> 01:14.742
Kaylee?!

01:14.842 --> 01:16.210
(sighs)

01:16.310 --> 01:18.078
(wooden creaking)

01:18.179 --> 01:19.913
Everything's okay, bug.

01:20.013 --> 01:22.816
Mommy's gonna keep you safe
from whatever this is.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.552
(creaking)

01:40.601 --> 01:43.404
(creaking)

01:43.504 --> 01:46.106
(screaming)

01:46.207 --> 01:48.776
What do you want from us?!

01:48.876 --> 01:51.445
* *

01:57.551 --> 01:59.987
(tea kettle whistling)

02:00.087 --> 02:02.190
Morning.
Morning.

02:02.290 --> 02:04.091
Morning.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.834
Excuse you.

02:13.934 --> 02:16.170
Who said you could
have coffee?

02:17.004 --> 02:18.406
Just this once?

02:18.506 --> 02:21.108
I was up late. I was finishing
my calculus homework.

02:21.209 --> 02:23.143
You mean
"Cam-culus"?

02:23.244 --> 02:25.078
I heard you talking
to him late

02:25.179 --> 02:26.247
last night.

02:26.347 --> 02:27.915
I called him for
help on an equation.

02:28.015 --> 02:29.517
Sure was a whole lot
of giggling going on.

02:29.617 --> 02:31.285
I don't remember math
being that fun.

02:31.385 --> 02:33.554
It is, when you're
studying with Cam.
Mm-hmm.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.423
(both chuckle)

02:35.523 --> 02:37.725
No. I have something else
that will

02:37.825 --> 02:39.427
raise your
blood sugar.

02:39.527 --> 02:41.061
(phone chimes)

02:45.299 --> 02:46.267
I got to go.

02:46.367 --> 02:47.968
DELILAH:
Uh, Mom, hold on.

02:48.068 --> 02:49.770
Have you given
any thought

02:49.870 --> 02:52.005
to what
we talked about?

02:52.105 --> 02:53.106
Training me.

02:53.207 --> 02:54.642
How to defend
myself, to do

02:54.742 --> 02:56.076
the things
that you do.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.579
(sighs) Can we talk
about this later?

03:00.047 --> 03:01.081
Sure.

03:06.254 --> 03:08.055
Dee... (sighs)

03:08.155 --> 03:10.591
I know what happened
was scary, but

03:10.691 --> 03:12.626
I don't want you to worry
about that stuff.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.995
You have already
been through enough.

03:16.764 --> 03:20.033
When my dad died...

03:20.133 --> 03:21.702
(sighs)

03:21.802 --> 03:24.705
I had to grow up way faster
than I should've.

03:26.374 --> 03:28.141
And I don't want that for you.

03:28.242 --> 03:30.611
So, I get no say in this?

03:30.711 --> 03:33.180
Yes, of course
you do,

03:33.281 --> 03:36.216
but sometimes I'm gonna have
to make decisions that you are

03:36.317 --> 03:37.618
not gonna like,

03:37.718 --> 03:38.986
but it's just because
I'm looking out for you,

03:39.086 --> 03:40.688
even if you can't see that now.

03:41.989 --> 03:43.657
Now, I got to run,
so if you want to talk

03:43.757 --> 03:45.893
more later,
I'm here.

03:45.993 --> 03:47.928
Okay.

03:48.028 --> 03:49.797
Excuse me?

03:49.897 --> 03:52.266
Did you forget
something?

03:52.366 --> 03:54.435
I did not

03:54.535 --> 03:55.903
forget our agreement;
it's just

03:56.003 --> 03:57.605
a meeting, nothing serious.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.540
Nothing serious and...

03:59.640 --> 04:01.809
And I will call you
as soon as I

04:01.909 --> 04:03.677
find out more.
There we go.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.245
(chuckles)
VI: Have a good day.

04:06.547 --> 04:08.816
DELILAH:
Bye.

04:10.384 --> 04:13.454
I can't take much more of this.
I don't know what to do.

04:13.554 --> 04:15.689
Hey, why don't you just

04:15.789 --> 04:17.224
start at the beginning?

04:17.325 --> 04:19.627
(sighs)

04:19.727 --> 04:21.695
I know how this
is going to sound...

04:22.630 --> 04:24.131
...but I think

04:24.231 --> 04:27.200
my dead husband
is trying to kill me.

04:27.301 --> 04:29.136
(chuckles) I know.

04:29.236 --> 04:31.339
This is the part
where you tell me I'm crazy.

04:31.439 --> 04:34.174
This is the part
where you elaborate.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.744
Of course. (sighs)

04:39.079 --> 04:41.715
It all started
a couple weeks back.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.684
At first it was small things.

04:43.784 --> 04:46.454
I smelled his cologne
in the hallway,

04:46.554 --> 04:50.358
I heard footsteps
in the basement.

04:50.458 --> 04:52.993
But then last night, I found

04:53.093 --> 04:55.396
a knife stuck through
my wedding picture,

04:55.496 --> 04:56.630
pinning it to the bedroom door.

04:56.730 --> 04:59.299
And you say your husband
passed away?

04:59.400 --> 05:01.702
Nine months ago.

05:02.536 --> 05:05.639
So, you think it's his ghost...

05:05.739 --> 05:07.040
(sighs)
...that stuck that knife

05:07.140 --> 05:09.677
in your door?
No. I-I mean...

05:11.812 --> 05:13.981
(scoffs) I-I don't know
what to think.

05:14.081 --> 05:15.916
I don't believe in ghosts.
I just, I don't know how else

05:16.016 --> 05:17.017
to explain
what's been happening.

05:17.117 --> 05:18.619
Have you gone to the police?

05:18.719 --> 05:20.554
Yes.

05:20.654 --> 05:23.023
They-they couldn't do
anything without more evidence.

05:23.123 --> 05:26.293
What they did
do was call

05:26.394 --> 05:27.928
Children's Services to my house.

05:28.028 --> 05:31.465
They assumed that
I'm losing it,

05:31.565 --> 05:33.634
that I'm unfit to be a mother.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.637
Hey, it's okay.

05:36.737 --> 05:39.139
It's okay.
How many kids do you have?

05:39.239 --> 05:42.476
Just a little girl.
She's four years old.
Ah.

05:42.576 --> 05:44.612
That's a good age.
(laughs) The best.

05:44.712 --> 05:46.079
(crying):
I just...

05:46.179 --> 05:47.681
(sighs)

05:47.781 --> 05:50.117
I'm trying
to hold it together for her.

05:50.217 --> 05:53.120
Single parent, working a
full-time job, it's been tough.

05:54.555 --> 05:56.857
Please, will you help me
figure out what's happening?

05:56.957 --> 05:59.192
I really don't want
to lose my little girl.

05:59.292 --> 06:01.161
Hey, hey.

06:02.663 --> 06:05.799
No one's gonna take
your little girl away from you.

06:06.734 --> 06:08.902
MEL:
I feel for her, Rob,
but what are we supposed to do?

06:09.002 --> 06:10.404
I don't know just yet.

06:10.504 --> 06:11.539
So why take the case?

06:11.639 --> 06:12.873
You get dozens
of e-mails a day

06:12.973 --> 06:14.708
asking for help.
Yeah, but I hate that everyone

06:14.808 --> 06:16.777
is automatically
calling her crazy.

06:16.877 --> 06:17.911
I know what it's like

06:18.011 --> 06:20.814
to be gaslit.
CIA sure tried.

06:20.914 --> 06:23.150
And they weren't even the worst.
Who's worse than the CIA?

06:23.250 --> 06:24.251
The PTA.

06:24.351 --> 06:26.520
(laughs) Oh, no.

06:26.620 --> 06:27.988
ROBYN:
It was just after my divorce,

06:28.088 --> 06:29.923
I was still
in my feelings.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.359
There was this one teacher
at Dee's school,

06:32.460 --> 06:34.361
she was not my biggest fan.

06:35.195 --> 06:38.832
I was a working mom. I didn't
make cupcakes for the bake sale.

06:38.932 --> 06:40.601
HARRY:
I do miss bake sales.
All those sugary treats,

06:40.701 --> 06:42.870
you know, no one making you
feel guilty about eating them,

06:42.970 --> 06:44.204
you know, 'cause it's
for a good cause.

06:44.304 --> 06:45.539
That's the takeaway
from this story?

06:45.639 --> 06:47.040
Really? Okay.
Sorry.

06:47.140 --> 06:49.610
Anyway, one day,
I go to pick up Dee,

06:49.710 --> 06:51.011
and she's not there.

06:51.111 --> 06:53.481
And this teacher
tries to convince me

06:53.581 --> 06:56.884
that I already picked her up
and had somehow forgotten.

06:56.984 --> 06:59.487
She tried to tell you
you had forgotten

06:59.587 --> 07:00.754
to pick up your own kid?

07:00.854 --> 07:02.956
So, wait,
Dee is just

07:03.056 --> 07:05.893
gone and no one's
listening to you?

07:05.993 --> 07:08.228
You must've been panicked.
Terrified.

07:08.328 --> 07:10.564
I mean, it turns out
Miles had gotten her, but

07:10.664 --> 07:12.132
I went through five minutes
of hell, all because

07:12.232 --> 07:14.034
this teacher didn't believe me.

07:14.134 --> 07:16.837
HARRY:
There's no reason to doubt
Evelyn about one thing.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.772
Her husband is dead.
Coroner's report

07:18.872 --> 07:21.975
said that he died nine months
ago in a cabin fire upstate.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.311
Body was badly burned,
but the dental records matched.

07:24.411 --> 07:27.981
Okay, so if it wasn't him,
and it's not a ghost...

07:28.081 --> 07:30.751
Who put the knife
through Evelyn's door?

07:31.719 --> 07:33.821
Hey, you.

07:33.921 --> 07:38.091
Just making some lunch and...
(sighs) ...thinking about you.

07:39.493 --> 07:40.861
Yeah.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.196
I can't wait
to see you again, too.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.665
(doorbell rings)

07:44.765 --> 07:46.900
Trish, hold on a second.
There's somebody at the door.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.070
Trish?

07:50.170 --> 07:52.039
What are you doing here?
Hi.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.841
I know I shouldn't have
stopped by unannounced,

07:53.941 --> 07:55.609
but I just figured
your family was gone,

07:55.709 --> 07:56.877
and last night
was so amazing,

07:56.977 --> 07:57.978
I just couldn't wait
to see you again.

07:58.078 --> 08:00.781
I'm so glad you did.

08:03.951 --> 08:06.419
Come on in.
(chuckles)

08:07.721 --> 08:09.089
Oh, I brought
you macarons

08:09.189 --> 08:11.625
from Ladurée.
VI: Earl Grey or passion fruit?

08:11.725 --> 08:13.226
Both.
Oh!

08:13.326 --> 08:15.328
(both laugh)

08:18.599 --> 08:20.433
(clears throat)

08:22.836 --> 08:24.404
Hi, Dee.

08:24.504 --> 08:25.573
You're home early.

08:25.673 --> 08:27.074
Yeah. (stammers) The HVAC system

08:27.174 --> 08:29.042
at our school
broke down, so

08:29.142 --> 08:31.378
they just sent everyone home.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.048
I'm gonna go, because I just...

08:35.148 --> 08:36.850
I wanted to drop
those off for you.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.619
No, don't go, please.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.053
I think

08:40.153 --> 08:43.256
it's about time
you met my family.

08:44.024 --> 08:47.828
Trish, this is my beautiful
great-niece, Delilah.

08:47.928 --> 08:50.263
Dee, this is Trish.

08:51.198 --> 08:52.633
It is so nice
to finally meet you.

08:52.733 --> 08:55.202
(all laugh)
It's a pleasure
to meet you, too.

08:55.302 --> 08:58.538
And beautiful
is an understatement.

08:58.639 --> 09:01.074
Oh. Thank you.

09:02.109 --> 09:04.277
I was, I was just making lunch.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.813
Can you stay?

09:05.913 --> 09:07.981
Yes, I can stay.

09:10.984 --> 09:12.252
All right.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.255
My sister, Alex.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.124
She's been helping me
with Kaylee since Richard died.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.492
It's nice to have family around.

09:19.593 --> 09:20.961
I can't tell you
how relieved I am that

09:21.061 --> 09:23.030
someone's finally
taking Evelyn seriously.

09:23.130 --> 09:25.098
This whole thing's
been a little unnerving.

09:25.198 --> 09:26.967
It is an unusual case.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.902
(door opens)
ALEX: If you ask me,

09:29.002 --> 09:30.604
she never should've told
the police about her

09:30.704 --> 09:31.672
postpartum depression.

09:31.772 --> 09:32.873
After that,

09:32.973 --> 09:33.907
they've dismissed
everything else.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.609
Sorry to hear that.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.711
Can't say I'm surprised, though.

09:37.811 --> 09:39.179
MEL: No signs of
a break-in outside.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.414
I noticed there are
security cameras out front

09:41.514 --> 09:42.850
and in the back.
Yeah. I checked them.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.384
But I didn't see
anything unusual.

09:44.484 --> 09:46.086
I'd still like to take a look,
if you don't mind.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.354
Of course. Whatever you need.

09:47.454 --> 09:48.889
Is there anything
else about the house

09:48.989 --> 09:50.123
or the property
we should know about?

09:51.759 --> 09:53.593
(sighs)

09:53.694 --> 09:55.663
I swear I'm not
imagining this,

09:55.763 --> 09:57.330
but I heard them

09:57.430 --> 10:00.968
again this morning,
the footsteps.

10:02.402 --> 10:03.904
Where?

10:04.872 --> 10:06.239
In the basement.

10:06.339 --> 10:09.142
I was too scared to go down,
but I know what I heard.

10:32.800 --> 10:33.967
ROBYN:
Oh.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.203
Well, someone's
been down here.

10:36.303 --> 10:39.439
Looks like a man's boot,
at least a size 12.

10:39.539 --> 10:41.574
(sniffs)

10:41.675 --> 10:42.776
Strange.

10:42.876 --> 10:43.977
What?

10:44.077 --> 10:45.378
Smells like ash.

10:47.314 --> 10:48.448
Didn't her husband die in a...

10:48.548 --> 10:50.217
In a raging fire.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.595
Evelyn is clearly
not delusional,

11:02.696 --> 11:04.798
but someone is going to
extreme lengths to make her

11:04.898 --> 11:06.333
think she is.
Mm-hmm.

11:08.936 --> 11:10.203
Are the cameras not working?

11:10.303 --> 11:12.305
No, they are,
but whoever's sneaking in

11:12.405 --> 11:13.573
knows where
the cameras are pointed,

11:13.673 --> 11:15.342
so we changed the field of view,

11:15.442 --> 11:17.344
and if they come back,
we might catch them.

11:17.444 --> 11:19.579
ROBYN:
Evelyn, is there anyone
you can think of

11:19.679 --> 11:20.914
who'd want to do this to you?

11:21.014 --> 11:23.150
Anyone you might be
in conflict with?

11:23.250 --> 11:25.953
Tell them. Astrid.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.454
EVELYN:
Oh, she would not do this.

11:27.554 --> 11:28.822
ALEX:
You also said
she wouldn't steal.

11:28.922 --> 11:30.023
Who's Astrid?

11:30.123 --> 11:32.993
My au pair.
Until a month ago.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.461
KAYLEE:
Mommy!

11:34.561 --> 11:36.930
Kaylee's up from her nap.
I'll get her. Tell them.

11:41.301 --> 11:45.438
Some jewelry went missing
and... (sighs)

11:45.538 --> 11:47.440
I really liked her,
but I couldn't leave my daughter

11:47.540 --> 11:48.742
with someone I can't trust.

11:48.842 --> 11:49.977
Astrid was

11:50.077 --> 11:51.711
very angry, made some threats,

11:51.812 --> 11:54.047
and now she's suing me
for back pay.

11:54.147 --> 11:55.348
We're gonna need her info.

11:55.448 --> 11:56.784
Of course.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.487
(chuckles)

12:00.587 --> 12:02.856
Who is this cutie?
And who do you have there?

12:02.956 --> 12:04.992
Mr. Buns.

12:05.092 --> 12:07.260
Oh...
(laughs) Mr. Buns.

12:09.196 --> 12:12.699
Can I see Daddy
at the window again?

12:22.409 --> 12:23.576
That's Richard.

12:23.676 --> 12:25.078
I hide it so she's not

12:25.178 --> 12:27.280
constantly reminded he's gone.

12:27.380 --> 12:28.415
She must miss him
so much.

12:28.515 --> 12:30.083
EVELYN:
He wasn't always

12:30.183 --> 12:31.919
the best
husband, but...

12:32.019 --> 12:34.487
he was a good dad.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.795
Hey, why don't you just
take a break?

12:41.895 --> 12:42.896
Good idea.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.497
You should take Kaylee

12:44.597 --> 12:46.834
to play-land.
She can see her friends,

12:46.934 --> 12:49.469
and you could use
some fresh air.

12:50.570 --> 12:52.272
(bike bell rings)

12:52.372 --> 12:55.008
(birds singing)

12:56.409 --> 12:58.245
MEL:
Hey!

12:58.345 --> 12:59.980
You gonna have fun at the park?
Yeah.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.816
Well...
(imitates explosion)
(giggling)

13:02.916 --> 13:04.517
MEL:
Okay, I'll see you later.
(honks) Bye.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.486
Pretty good at that.

13:06.586 --> 13:08.688
Uh, yeah,
not happening.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.523
One child at home is enough.

13:11.992 --> 13:13.560
MEL:
So, uh...

13:13.660 --> 13:15.662
so what happens now? We're
gonna go talk to the au pair?

13:17.230 --> 13:18.498
Can you and Harry handle that?

13:18.598 --> 13:19.799
Want to check
something out.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.668
Okay.

13:28.408 --> 13:31.311
This is me
at age five.

13:31.411 --> 13:34.647
And this is my daughter
at the same age.

13:34.747 --> 13:37.450
Everyone says
we look just alike.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.486
Twins.
Mm-hmm.

13:39.586 --> 13:41.788
So, Mrs. Peters,
you said you saw some

13:41.889 --> 13:43.323
suspicious activity
on the street?

13:43.423 --> 13:45.658
Yes, on several occasions.

13:45.758 --> 13:48.528
I noted
an old brown sedan

13:48.628 --> 13:51.131
sitting down the block, idling.

13:51.231 --> 13:53.233
Did you report it?
Of course,

13:53.333 --> 13:55.835
but the officer said
it had to be parked

13:55.936 --> 13:59.406
for a minimum of 48 hours
to be suspicious.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.208
What could be more suspicious

14:01.308 --> 14:02.642
than a car
obviously

14:02.742 --> 14:04.477
casing our neighborhood?

14:04.577 --> 14:06.613
Witness any break-ins?

14:06.713 --> 14:09.316
Not yet, but I can't be
at the window 24 hours a day.

14:09.416 --> 14:12.552
There's only so much
I can do.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.155
Speaking of which,

14:15.255 --> 14:17.424
did you happen to take down
the license plate number?

14:17.524 --> 14:19.792
You kidding?
I take down

14:19.893 --> 14:22.930
the plate of every car
that parks on this block.

14:23.030 --> 14:25.465
DANTE:
Her neighbors must love that.

14:25.565 --> 14:28.168
ROBYN:
(chuckles) I'm not mad at her.

14:28.268 --> 14:31.304
Every neighborhood could use
a Mrs. Peters.

14:31.404 --> 14:32.805
You run that plate I gave you?

14:32.906 --> 14:34.908
A brown Tercel.
Registered to a Evan Hilliard.

14:35.008 --> 14:36.509
ROBYN:
Got anything on him?

14:36.609 --> 14:37.777
No record. I gave him a call,
says he sold

14:37.877 --> 14:39.079
his car for cash
three weeks ago.

14:39.179 --> 14:41.581
And let me guess,
no paperwork on the sale.

14:41.681 --> 14:43.716
Or real description
of the buyer.

14:43.816 --> 14:46.119
He went by "John Smith" and wore
sunglasses and a baseball cap.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.855
Real master of disguise.
Thanks anyway, Dante.

14:48.956 --> 14:51.191
I put a BOLO out on the car,
just in case.

14:51.291 --> 14:53.693
I'll keep you posted
if it bears any fruit.

14:54.761 --> 14:56.163
MEL:
You seriously forgot
to buy them?

14:56.263 --> 14:58.798
Your capacity to remember
insane amounts of code

14:58.898 --> 15:00.833
is limitless,
but I ask you

15:00.934 --> 15:03.736
to pick up concert tickets, and
you completely drop the ball.
I'm sorry,

15:03.836 --> 15:05.372
but, I mean, honestly,
is it that big of a deal?

15:05.472 --> 15:06.539
Yes!
I mean,
it's not like we

15:06.639 --> 15:08.208
haven't seen
the Pixies before.

15:08.308 --> 15:10.710
Yeah, but since you've been
alive again, the most exciting

15:10.810 --> 15:12.579
thing we've done is check
out a hot dog cart.

15:12.679 --> 15:14.581
Yeah, I'm sorry, but those
were really good dogs.

15:14.681 --> 15:16.183
I mean, I longed
for those dogs.

15:16.283 --> 15:18.718
All I'm saying is that
I would love a date

15:18.818 --> 15:20.553
that didn't involve
encased meats.

15:20.653 --> 15:22.122
I'm not 100%...
BOY: No!

15:22.222 --> 15:23.856
Come on, we have to put
your jacket on.
No, I don't want

15:23.957 --> 15:26.093
to put on the jacket!
I don't want it!

15:26.193 --> 15:27.560
This is it.

15:27.660 --> 15:29.896
Uh, hey, hi,
A-Astrid, uh, Lindholm?

15:29.997 --> 15:31.098
Hi.
Yes?

15:31.198 --> 15:32.465
MEL: We want to
talk to you about

15:32.565 --> 15:34.301
your time working
for Evelyn Weber.

15:34.401 --> 15:35.868
Go inside.

15:37.137 --> 15:38.738
You're from the agency?

15:38.838 --> 15:40.540
Yeah, we're just
following up

15:40.640 --> 15:42.475
on a report she filed.
Whatever she said,
it's all lies.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.911
I never took anything
from that hateful woman.

15:45.012 --> 15:46.679
So, uh, y-you don't
like her much, I take it?

15:46.779 --> 15:49.482
I don't like being
falsely accused of stealing.

15:50.817 --> 15:52.252
And she wasn't my favorite job
before that, no.

15:52.352 --> 15:55.288
Evelyn and Richard were always
fighting about something.

15:55.388 --> 15:56.923
Then he died.

15:57.024 --> 15:59.826
She was already driving
herself crazy with work, and...

15:59.926 --> 16:01.694
after that, she kind of
just fell apart.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.397
Can you tell us your whereabouts
last night after 11:00 p.m.?

16:04.497 --> 16:06.433
Well, this time, I have proof
I did nothing wrong.

16:06.533 --> 16:07.934
I was here all night.

16:08.035 --> 16:10.637
You can ask my boss.
Then you can leave.

16:11.838 --> 16:13.740
Oh.
Charming.

16:13.840 --> 16:16.709
I'm suddenly having
Catholic school nun flashbacks.

16:16.809 --> 16:17.844
You didn't go
to Catholic school.

16:17.944 --> 16:19.246
I know.
(laughs)
(phone chimes)

16:20.347 --> 16:22.282
Oh.

16:22.382 --> 16:24.684
The sensor on one of the cameras
at Evelyn's house just went off.

16:24.784 --> 16:25.918
Someone is literally
breaking in.

16:26.019 --> 16:28.988
Rob, someone's
at Evelyn's house.

16:57.117 --> 16:59.152
* *

17:07.727 --> 17:09.896
(door opens)

17:17.604 --> 17:19.572
(grunting)

17:30.217 --> 17:32.719
Start talking.
Who the hell are you?

17:32.819 --> 17:35.188
(panting) Kevin Weber.

17:35.288 --> 17:38.225
Evelyn was married
to my brother Richard.

17:38.325 --> 17:39.959
Why the hell
are you in her house?

17:40.059 --> 17:42.862
Easy.
Because of this.

17:42.962 --> 17:44.231
It belonged to my father.

17:44.331 --> 17:45.532
It should've gone to me
when Rich died,

17:45.632 --> 17:47.467
but she wouldn't hand it over.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.936
So you decided
to steal it back.

17:50.036 --> 17:52.472
It's not stealing
if it belongs to me.

17:52.572 --> 17:53.906
Is that how you justify

17:54.006 --> 17:55.575
constantly breaking in here
to torment her?

17:55.675 --> 17:57.444
Hold on, this is the first time

17:57.544 --> 17:59.011
I've been in here
since Rich died.

17:59.112 --> 18:01.714
I stopped by a couple of times,
but she won't let me in.

18:01.814 --> 18:03.416
I had no choice.
Okay, whatever you say.

18:03.516 --> 18:05.852
Let's let the police
sort it out.
The police?

18:05.952 --> 18:08.388
She's the one you should be
taking in, not me.

18:08.488 --> 18:09.822
Why's that?

18:09.922 --> 18:12.292
She really has you fooled,
doesn't she?

18:12.392 --> 18:15.695
You think my brother's
death was an accident.

18:15.795 --> 18:17.997
Well, it wasn't.
Evelyn set that fire.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.065
What proof do you have of that?

18:19.166 --> 18:20.600
You do know there's a history

18:20.700 --> 18:22.469
of mental illness
in that family,

18:22.569 --> 18:23.703
and that it
was her idea

18:23.803 --> 18:25.004
to go to that cabin
for the weekend.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.806
That doesn't prove anything.

18:26.906 --> 18:29.742
She just happened to be hiking
when the fire started?

18:29.842 --> 18:32.745
They were struggling
financially.

18:32.845 --> 18:35.114
I bet she didn't tell
you that, did she?

18:35.215 --> 18:37.116
So you think she
killed him for the money?

18:37.217 --> 18:39.852
He was worth more to her dead
than alive.

18:42.655 --> 18:44.491
Looks like Evelyn's husband

18:44.591 --> 18:46.859
spent every penny she made
on failed start-ups.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.761
Their bank accounts were
nearly empty when he died.

18:48.861 --> 18:51.898
Now, there's nearly
800 grand in there.
Life insurance?

18:51.998 --> 18:53.500
A policy on
Richard Weber

18:53.600 --> 18:56.903
that was upped a few million
only six weeks before he died.

18:57.003 --> 18:59.071
HARRY:
This guy was
drowning in debt.

18:59.172 --> 19:00.440
You know, I mean,
he could've written a book

19:00.540 --> 19:01.741
on bad business decisions.

19:01.841 --> 19:03.310
I mean, look,
I hate to say it, but

19:03.410 --> 19:05.111
what if Evelyn's brother-in-law
is right, you know?

19:05.212 --> 19:07.380
I mean, what if Evelyn
isn't the victim here?

19:07.480 --> 19:10.049
What if she killed her husband?

19:18.191 --> 19:19.592
It just doesn't
make sense. Why come

19:19.692 --> 19:21.093
to us to investigate
if she murdered her husband?

19:21.194 --> 19:23.530
And why stage all those
creepy things at her own house?

19:23.630 --> 19:25.465
Maybe she feels bad about it,
you know? And all this is

19:25.565 --> 19:27.634
some sort of psychosomatic
manifestation of her guilt.

19:27.734 --> 19:29.602
I get that this
looks suspicious,

19:29.702 --> 19:32.805
but my gut is telling me
there's something else going on.

19:32.905 --> 19:34.907
(phone rings)

19:35.007 --> 19:36.243
(phone beeps)
Hello?

19:36.343 --> 19:38.778
Hi, this is Alex,
Evelyn's sister.

19:38.878 --> 19:39.946
Everything okay?

19:40.046 --> 19:41.147
Is Evelyn with you?

19:41.248 --> 19:42.449
ALEX:
That's why I'm calling.

19:42.549 --> 19:43.850
I work at
a stable upstate.

19:43.950 --> 19:45.452
We were going to take
Kaylee horseback riding,

19:45.552 --> 19:47.754
but they never showed.
(sighs) I've been trying

19:47.854 --> 19:49.389
to get in touch with her,
but I can't get through.

19:49.489 --> 19:50.657
Okay, o-okay.

19:50.757 --> 19:52.024
Just calm down.
I'll check on her.

19:52.124 --> 19:53.025
ALEX: Please
ask her to call me,

19:53.125 --> 19:54.494
just so I know she's okay.

19:54.594 --> 19:56.128
Will do.
(phone beeps)

19:56.229 --> 19:57.597
Call Dante.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.366
Make sure the brother-in-law
has a solid alibi.

19:59.466 --> 20:01.901
We're on it.
And before we label
the single mother unstable,

20:02.001 --> 20:04.971
I want to eliminate
every other possibility.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.445
TRISH:
Your aunt was the bomb
back in the day.

20:12.545 --> 20:13.846
Was?

20:13.946 --> 20:15.948
You still are. I wouldn't
be here if you weren't.

20:17.216 --> 20:21.020
TRISH:
You, young lady,
are related to the "it girl"

20:21.120 --> 20:22.322
of the early '80s art scene.

20:22.422 --> 20:23.723
Your aunt
rubbed shoulders

20:23.823 --> 20:26.593
with everyone:
Keith Haring, Mapplethorpe,

20:26.693 --> 20:27.794
Basquiat.

20:27.894 --> 20:30.129
I'm-I'm sorry,
you-you knew Basquiat?

20:30.229 --> 20:33.032
Who do you think gave him the
idea to sell postcards for cash?

20:33.132 --> 20:35.335
Seriously?
True story.

20:35.435 --> 20:37.103
Basquiat even
invited her

20:37.203 --> 20:38.271
to do an exhibit with him.

20:38.371 --> 20:40.540
Okay, and?
Well, your aunt, you know,

20:40.640 --> 20:41.741
the perfectionist that she is,

20:41.841 --> 20:45.011
it just wasn't quite ready yet.

20:45.111 --> 20:46.913
Well, it wasn't. Just...

20:47.013 --> 20:49.682
Jean-Michel just dropped it
on me with no time to prepare.

20:49.782 --> 20:51.784
TRISH:
I thought it was done.
It was beautiful.

20:51.884 --> 20:54.186
But what do I know?
I'm not an artist.

20:54.287 --> 20:55.822
(laughs)

20:55.922 --> 20:58.090
Why are you filling this girl's
head with all these stories?

20:58.190 --> 20:59.626
That was a million years ago.
Stop, are you kidding?

20:59.726 --> 21:01.628
I can't believe you never
told me any of this.

21:01.728 --> 21:03.763
Come on, I want to hear more.

21:03.863 --> 21:06.633
Next time, okay? I got to go.
I'm late for work.

21:06.733 --> 21:08.368
(laughs)

21:14.741 --> 21:16.443
I'll see you later.
Yeah, I'll see you later.

21:16.543 --> 21:18.911
Okay.
(laughs)

21:19.011 --> 21:21.080
(door opens)

21:21.180 --> 21:22.949
(door closes)

21:23.049 --> 21:25.117
(sighs)

21:25.217 --> 21:26.719
Hmm?

21:26.819 --> 21:29.221
So...

21:29.322 --> 21:30.390
what was, uh,

21:30.490 --> 21:32.191
Basquiat like, hmm?

21:32.291 --> 21:34.160
Ah, not now, Dee.

21:34.260 --> 21:37.063
I just want to get these dishes

21:37.163 --> 21:39.332
loaded before

21:39.432 --> 21:41.100
the food sets, sweetheart.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.535
Oh, come on, Auntie, spill.

21:42.635 --> 21:43.870
I mean, seriously.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.705
I mean, did you guys
paint together?

21:45.805 --> 21:47.139
Did he influence your work?

21:47.239 --> 21:48.775
Dee, enough.

21:50.343 --> 21:51.811
Just... (sighs)

21:54.681 --> 21:56.749
I said not now.

22:00.553 --> 22:02.054
(knock on door)

22:03.122 --> 22:05.257
(knock on door)
KAYLEE (screaming):
Mommy!

22:05.358 --> 22:06.559
Evelyn?

22:06.659 --> 22:09.028
KAYLEE:
Mommy!

22:09.128 --> 22:10.229
Mom!

22:10.329 --> 22:12.999
Mommy!

22:13.099 --> 22:14.033
Hey.

22:14.133 --> 22:15.502
She's gonna be okay.

22:16.803 --> 22:17.704
Evelyn?

22:17.804 --> 22:19.305
Hey, Evelyn,
come on, wake up.

22:19.406 --> 22:21.374
Wake up. Wake up.

22:21.474 --> 22:23.309
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

22:23.410 --> 22:24.411
You okay?

22:24.511 --> 22:25.612
What are you doing here?

22:25.712 --> 22:27.414
What happened?
You tell me.

22:27.514 --> 22:28.715
You were passed out.

22:28.815 --> 22:31.651
I put Kaylee down for a nap...

22:31.751 --> 22:34.353
I started the laundry...

22:34.454 --> 22:36.556
then...
Then what?

22:37.957 --> 22:39.392
I took some Xanax

22:39.492 --> 22:40.693
for my anxiety.

22:40.793 --> 22:42.194
Did you take more today
than you usually do?

22:42.294 --> 22:45.665
(sighs) I don't think so.
I-I don't, I don't know.

22:46.933 --> 22:47.967
(sighs)

22:48.067 --> 22:50.837
Maybe I really am
losing my mind.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.440
(phone camera clicks)

22:53.540 --> 22:55.475
(knocking at door)
WOMAN:
Hello?

22:58.277 --> 23:00.246
Anyone home?

23:00.346 --> 23:02.515
Hello?

23:04.451 --> 23:06.519
Hello.

23:06.619 --> 23:08.655
I'm Beth Biven,
Child Services.

23:08.755 --> 23:11.057
I'm a friend of Evelyn's.
Can I help you?

23:11.157 --> 23:12.992
BIVEN:
I came by here
a couple of weeks ago

23:13.092 --> 23:14.260
to check on Kaylee.

23:14.360 --> 23:16.228
Beth. Hi.

23:16.328 --> 23:17.564
What are you
doing here again?

23:17.664 --> 23:19.432
Kaylee, are you
feeling okay?

23:19.532 --> 23:21.768
Have you been hurt,
sweetheart?

23:21.868 --> 23:23.202
No. Nothing
like that.

23:23.302 --> 23:24.937
She is healthy,

23:25.037 --> 23:26.806
safe, happy.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.374
BIVEN:
Have you been drinking
today, Evelyn?

23:28.475 --> 23:30.076
Have you taken any substances?

23:30.176 --> 23:33.079
Beth, Evelyn is a perfectly
capable mother.

23:33.179 --> 23:35.047
That's what I'm here
to determine. That child

23:35.147 --> 23:36.282
is my concern.

23:36.382 --> 23:37.950
ROBYN: And I know you're
just doing your job,

23:38.050 --> 23:40.352
but I've seen Evelyn
with her daughter, and

23:40.453 --> 23:42.188
she's juggling a lot,

23:42.288 --> 23:43.990
but Kaylee is
her top priority.

23:44.090 --> 23:45.892
BIVEN:
Ma'am, would you let me finish
this interview, please?

23:45.992 --> 23:47.393
ROBYN:
Beth, if I may be honest,

23:47.494 --> 23:48.928
if every woman
going through tough times

23:49.028 --> 23:51.764
lost the right to parent,
we'd all be orphans.

23:51.864 --> 23:55.101
Clearly,
Kaylee's uninjured.

23:55.201 --> 23:57.637
Can we just cut
her mother a break?

23:59.038 --> 24:00.507
Well, it does appear
that Kaylee

24:00.607 --> 24:01.808
is unharmed,

24:01.908 --> 24:03.375
but if I get another call,

24:03.476 --> 24:05.812
I will be
coming back again.

24:05.912 --> 24:08.681
Another call? This wasn't
a routine follow-up?

24:08.781 --> 24:10.683
No. My office received
an anonymous tip

24:10.783 --> 24:12.351
this morning that
the child at this address

24:12.451 --> 24:14.020
was being
neglected.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.689
And if at any future point
I find that to be true,

24:16.789 --> 24:19.659
I will be forced to remove her
for her own safety.

24:21.761 --> 24:23.663
Totally understand.

24:28.635 --> 24:29.936
(door closes)

24:31.337 --> 24:33.239
Hey. Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

24:33.339 --> 24:35.675
It's gonna be okay.
I got you.

24:35.775 --> 24:38.778
We're gonna figure this out
together, okay?

24:39.612 --> 24:41.247
I got you.

24:41.347 --> 24:43.115
Hey, how's Evelyn?

24:43.215 --> 24:44.951
ROBYN (over phone):
She's gonna be okay.

24:45.051 --> 24:46.986
Just needs some rest.
HARRY: I scanned the photo

24:47.086 --> 24:48.688
you sent of Evelyn's pills,
and your hunch was right.

24:48.788 --> 24:50.022
I mean, they're not Xanax.

24:50.122 --> 24:51.323
You know, although
it'd be hard to tell

24:51.423 --> 24:52.324
just by eyeballing them.

24:52.424 --> 24:53.693
Any idea what they are?

24:53.793 --> 24:54.961
No. I'm gonna send them over
to a private lab

24:55.061 --> 24:56.896
just as soon
as you send one over.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.531
ROBYN:
Swapping out her pills
is a serious escalation.

24:58.631 --> 25:00.232
This is way beyond
just spooking her.

25:00.332 --> 25:01.801
Yeah, maybe it's time
for Evelyn and Kaylee

25:01.901 --> 25:03.069
to get out of the house.

25:03.169 --> 25:04.604
Yeah, at least
until we figure out

25:04.704 --> 25:06.105
who's behind this.
(phone chimes)

25:09.842 --> 25:11.778
Dante just got a lead
on that brown sedan

25:11.878 --> 25:13.045
Evelyn's neighbor saw.

25:13.145 --> 25:14.180
You-you want us to check it out?
Yeah.

25:14.280 --> 25:15.247
I'm going to make sure

25:15.347 --> 25:16.549
Evelyn get resituated myself.

25:16.649 --> 25:18.951
I'll meet you when I'm done.

25:20.653 --> 25:22.421
(phone chimes)
Yes!

25:22.521 --> 25:25.758
You are officially off
the hook for Pixies tickets

25:25.858 --> 25:28.527
'cause I just
snagged some online.

25:28.628 --> 25:31.363
Hmm. That's right.
That's tonight, huh?

25:31.463 --> 25:33.365
Mm-hmm.

25:33.465 --> 25:34.767
Why don't you
give my ticket to Rob

25:34.867 --> 25:36.435
and make it kind of
like a girls' night?

25:36.535 --> 25:38.571
That sounds like fun, no?

25:38.671 --> 25:40.707
Okay, what's wrong with you?

25:40.807 --> 25:42.374
Hmm?
You didn't forget

25:42.474 --> 25:44.611
to buy the tickets, did you?
You just don't want to go.

25:44.711 --> 25:47.013
Oh. Hmm.

25:50.416 --> 25:52.652
HARRY:
We got a live one.

25:56.589 --> 25:57.957
That's him. Let's go.

26:04.697 --> 26:06.666
Split up!

26:10.569 --> 26:13.039
(grunting)

26:21.648 --> 26:24.717
(groaning)

26:31.390 --> 26:32.291
Richard Weber?

26:32.391 --> 26:33.760
MEL:
Evelyn's husband?

26:33.860 --> 26:35.828
Back from the dead.

26:45.171 --> 26:46.172
DANTE:
Arson, insurance fraud,

26:46.272 --> 26:47.506
breaking and entering.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.108
You've been busy
for a dead man.

26:49.208 --> 26:50.810
It's not what it looks like.
That so?

26:50.910 --> 26:52.378
You really thought
committing insurance fraud

26:52.478 --> 26:53.646
and making your family think

26:53.746 --> 26:54.981
you were dead
was a solution, Richard?

26:55.081 --> 26:56.282
RICHARD:
I know how it sounds.

26:56.382 --> 26:58.450
I don't think you do.
Tell the truth.

26:58.550 --> 27:01.654
You were mad at your wife
and wanted out of the marriage.

27:01.754 --> 27:03.756
That's what divorce is for.

27:03.856 --> 27:05.858
I needed that insurance payment
so Evelyn didn't have

27:05.958 --> 27:07.493
to sell the house,
declare bankruptcy.

27:07.593 --> 27:10.496
Husband of the year.
Curious. How'd you pull it off?

27:10.596 --> 27:12.398
Stole the body
from a graveyard?

27:12.498 --> 27:15.702
From a potter's field, yeah.

27:16.635 --> 27:18.237
DANTE:
And the dental records?

27:18.337 --> 27:20.139
Your death certificate said
they matched. You must have...

27:20.239 --> 27:21.974
Paid off the coroner.

27:22.074 --> 27:24.811
Everybody's got a price.
It's not something
I'm proud of.

27:26.278 --> 27:28.881
We know you've been
visiting Evelyn's house.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.516
A neighbor saw your car.

27:30.616 --> 27:32.318
Bet I can guess who that was.

27:32.418 --> 27:33.552
So you don't deny it?

27:33.652 --> 27:36.122
I tried staying away,

27:36.222 --> 27:38.590
but not seeing Kaylee, I...

27:38.691 --> 27:40.526
I didn't count on
how hard that would be.

27:41.928 --> 27:44.997
Usually, I'd just watch her
from the street, but sometimes

27:45.097 --> 27:49.836
I'd sneak in a window just to
hold her, just for a second.

27:49.936 --> 27:52.038
That explains
the cologne Evelyn smelled.

27:52.138 --> 27:53.639
And why Kaylee

27:53.740 --> 27:56.108
pointed to the window when
she said she saw her father.

27:56.208 --> 27:59.812
But it doesn't explain why he's
been trying to gaslight Evelyn.

27:59.912 --> 28:02.715
RICHARD:
Our marriage wasn't perfect,
but I love Evelyn.

28:02.815 --> 28:05.117
And I've admitted
to what I did wrong, but this,

28:05.217 --> 28:06.853
I did not do.
Everything I did was

28:06.953 --> 28:10.489
to protect her
and my daughter. Everything.

28:20.599 --> 28:23.302
EVELYN:
Richard?

28:31.710 --> 28:34.646
I thought she deserved
to know she wasn't crazy.

28:42.688 --> 28:44.656
How could you do this?

28:45.457 --> 28:46.959
I'm sorry.

28:47.059 --> 28:48.560
Why didn't you just tell me
what was going on?

28:48.660 --> 28:50.429
I would've helped.

28:52.164 --> 28:55.301
Did you really think
I'd prefer you dead than broke?

28:56.135 --> 28:59.638
That I'd want Kaylee
to grow up without a father?

29:03.709 --> 29:05.744
MEL:
You don't think he did it?

29:05.845 --> 29:07.546
I mean, why go
through the trouble

29:07.646 --> 29:09.581
of getting an insurance
policy to help Evelyn,

29:09.681 --> 29:11.784
then turn around
and torture her?

29:11.884 --> 29:15.554
Uh, at the top of my head--
he's a sociopath? Unhinged?

29:15.654 --> 29:18.390
I mean, the guy faked
his own death. Who does that?

29:18.490 --> 29:20.026
Harry.

29:20.126 --> 29:21.360
Touché.

29:21.460 --> 29:23.629
Okay, so if Richard
hasn't been the one

29:23.729 --> 29:25.431
messing with Evelyn,
then who has?

29:25.531 --> 29:27.033
Maybe we're looking
at this the wrong way.

29:27.133 --> 29:29.435
Maybe the goal wasn't
to torture Evelyn.

29:29.535 --> 29:30.937
What other motive is there?

29:31.037 --> 29:34.173
Someone made a call
to Child Protective Services

29:34.273 --> 29:35.808
the day Evelyn was drugged.

29:35.908 --> 29:38.110
They wanted Evelyn
and Kaylee separated.

29:38.210 --> 29:39.812
Maybe that
was the goal.

29:39.912 --> 29:41.848
That does point away
from Richard.

29:41.948 --> 29:45.184
If he wanted Kaylee, he had
plenty of chances to take her.

29:45.284 --> 29:47.186
And it's not like
he wanted custody,

29:47.286 --> 29:48.454
being dead and all.

29:48.554 --> 29:50.556
So if Evelyn was declared
an unfit mother,

29:50.656 --> 29:52.324
who would get custody?

29:52.424 --> 29:54.026
HARRY:
Ooh!

29:54.126 --> 29:55.294
Lookee here. According

29:55.394 --> 29:56.996
to their family trust,
in the event

29:57.096 --> 29:59.298
of Evelyn's incapacitation,
custody of Kaylee Weber

29:59.398 --> 30:01.700
goes to Evelyn's sister,
Alex Roth.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.270
She does have access
to the house.

30:04.370 --> 30:05.404
Can we tie
anything else to Alex?

30:05.504 --> 30:07.206
Alex said she worked at...

30:07.306 --> 30:08.207
at-at a horse stable, right?

30:08.307 --> 30:09.708
Yeah. So?

30:09.808 --> 30:11.077
Okay, so I just got
the report back from the lab

30:11.177 --> 30:12.211
about Evelyn's drugs

30:12.311 --> 30:13.412
that were swapped out, right?

30:13.512 --> 30:14.780
I-It's something
called xylazine.

30:14.881 --> 30:17.016
And it, too, is used
to treat anxiety.

30:17.116 --> 30:18.150
For horses.

30:18.250 --> 30:20.019
Evelyn's brother-in-law

30:20.119 --> 30:22.154
referenced a family history
of mental illness.

30:22.254 --> 30:23.489
What if he was right?

30:23.589 --> 30:26.158
Except it wasn't Evelyn
who inherited it.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.261
Mel, hold on.

30:29.361 --> 30:30.662
(tires squealing)

30:30.762 --> 30:32.564
Whoa. What is happening?
When Evelyn and Kaylee

30:32.664 --> 30:34.766
moved out, they went
to stay with Alex.

30:39.671 --> 30:41.607
(sighs)
How's Richard?

30:41.707 --> 30:45.177
Ugh. (chuckles)

30:46.178 --> 30:48.180
I don't want to talk about it.
(laughs)

30:48.280 --> 30:53.519
This has been one of
the craziest days of my life.

30:55.321 --> 30:56.622
Hey.

30:56.722 --> 30:58.958
Are you okay?

30:59.725 --> 31:01.994
Why wouldn't I be?

31:03.595 --> 31:05.397
Come here,
sweetie.

31:05.497 --> 31:09.068
I know. Hey, you.

31:23.182 --> 31:24.650
Evelyn? Evelyn?!

31:24.750 --> 31:26.885
MEL:
Oh, my God.

31:26.986 --> 31:28.687
Here. Here.

31:28.787 --> 31:30.256
(touch tones sounding)
Stay with me.

31:30.356 --> 31:31.390
I need an ambulance

31:31.490 --> 31:33.559
at 555 Shaw Avenue.

31:34.927 --> 31:37.729
Okay, ambulance is on its way.
Is she alive?

31:37.829 --> 31:38.998
Barely. Kaylee?

31:39.098 --> 31:41.533
Alex could have taken her.
I'll check.

31:41.633 --> 31:43.735
We gotta find them before
she hurts that little girl.

31:45.704 --> 31:47.106
HARRY (over phone):
I tracked her phone.

31:47.206 --> 31:48.607
Looks like she's headed
out of town.

31:48.707 --> 31:50.342
Should I have Dante
pick her up?

31:50.442 --> 31:51.610
ROBYN: No, no, no, we have to
exercise extreme caution

31:51.710 --> 31:53.779
bringing her in.
Try and pull her over,

31:53.879 --> 31:54.846
no telling what she'd do.

31:54.947 --> 31:56.248
What do you suggest?
Rob?

31:56.348 --> 31:58.050
You gotta see this.

31:58.150 --> 32:00.219
Harry, let me call you back.

32:00.319 --> 32:02.088
It was in the back
of a closet.

32:02.188 --> 32:04.290
Is that Alex with...
Mm-hmm.

32:04.390 --> 32:06.692
Evelyn's husband.
And she cut out Evelyn's face

32:06.792 --> 32:09.328
and put herself
on all the photos.

32:11.730 --> 32:12.531
What is this?

32:12.631 --> 32:13.932
Alex must have Photoshopped

32:14.033 --> 32:15.501
her face over Evelyn.

32:15.601 --> 32:18.204
She know you were still alive?

32:18.304 --> 32:21.273
I didn't think so, but
one time she passed my car

32:21.373 --> 32:23.542
as I was driving away
from having seen Kaylee.

32:23.642 --> 32:24.876
She could have seen me, but...

32:24.977 --> 32:26.645
Richard, if there's
something going on

32:26.745 --> 32:28.047
between you two
and you're not telling me...

32:28.147 --> 32:29.381
There's not.

32:30.382 --> 32:32.184
Not on my end, anyway.

32:32.284 --> 32:34.420
Gonna need you
to do something.

32:42.361 --> 32:44.663
ROBYN:
Hey, Alex.

32:49.335 --> 32:51.270
What are you doing here?
Where's Richard?

32:51.370 --> 32:53.239
He'll be here soon.
He told me to meet him here.

32:53.339 --> 32:55.407
Yes, he will.

32:55.507 --> 32:58.777
But his release from jail
still has to be processed.

33:00.379 --> 33:02.148
He didn't want you
to wait alone,

33:02.248 --> 33:04.650
so he asked me to come.

33:05.917 --> 33:08.120
So it's true.
They're letting him go?

33:08.220 --> 33:09.688
That's right.

33:09.788 --> 33:12.824
And then you two will
be able to be together.

33:14.026 --> 33:15.261
Alex,

33:15.361 --> 33:18.530
could you put
the knife down, please?

33:25.404 --> 33:27.273
May I sit?

33:28.807 --> 33:33.145
Richard told me that
you two used to date.

33:33.245 --> 33:35.314
Yes.

33:35.414 --> 33:37.849
We were high school sweethearts.
First love?

33:38.750 --> 33:40.619
Always holds a special place
in your heart.

33:40.719 --> 33:42.988
Rich and I were always
meant to be together.

33:44.123 --> 33:47.893
Before Evelyn stole him away.

33:49.695 --> 33:52.264
That must have been hard.
It was.

33:52.364 --> 33:54.400
I watched him
be unhappy for years.

33:54.500 --> 33:58.537
I knew he only stayed
out of pity for her,

33:58.637 --> 34:01.039
and I admired him for that.

34:01.140 --> 34:02.674
Then he died.

34:02.774 --> 34:05.344
It was so awful.

34:05.444 --> 34:07.846
But a couple weeks ago
I saw Richard

34:07.946 --> 34:09.615
just driving away
from the house,

34:09.715 --> 34:12.050
and I finally understood.

34:12.151 --> 34:14.120
You understood what?

34:14.220 --> 34:17.423
That he faked his death to get
out of his awful marriage.

34:17.523 --> 34:18.857
And I knew that
if I could just

34:18.957 --> 34:23.095
get Evelyn out of the way,
that we could be a family.

34:23.895 --> 34:27.199
The three of us, like
we were always supposed to.

34:27.299 --> 34:29.635
Family is important.

34:33.805 --> 34:36.708
Richard thinks family
is important, too.

34:36.808 --> 34:40.312
You know, you have a little
something on your cheek.

34:40.412 --> 34:42.348
You might want to
freshen up, you know.

34:42.448 --> 34:44.049
I'm sure you want
to look your best

34:44.150 --> 34:46.385
when Richard gets here.

34:48.854 --> 34:50.389
I'll keep an eye on Kaylee.

34:50.489 --> 34:52.491
Okay.

34:56.094 --> 34:57.496
I'll be right back.

35:03.335 --> 35:05.704
(police radio static)

35:07.173 --> 35:09.508
Liar.

35:12.411 --> 35:14.045
(both grunting)

35:14.146 --> 35:15.414
(Alex cries out)

35:18.350 --> 35:21.220
I'm warning you, stay down.

35:22.254 --> 35:24.122
OFFICER: All right,
hands behind your back.

35:24.223 --> 35:26.958
(indistinct chatter)

35:29.461 --> 35:31.230
ALEX (quietly):
Kaylee...

35:31.330 --> 35:33.098
* Cry once more... *

35:33.199 --> 35:34.500
DANTE:
You're cut.

35:34.600 --> 35:37.068
Oh, it's nothing.
Just a nick. I'll live.

35:37.169 --> 35:38.804
I'm gonna get her back
to where she belongs.

35:38.904 --> 35:39.705
Come here, baby.

35:39.805 --> 35:41.873
It's okay now. Come on.

35:41.973 --> 35:46.111
* I'd shower you,
I'd shower you *

35:46.212 --> 35:49.815
* If I could *

35:49.915 --> 35:52.150
* If *

35:52.251 --> 35:54.085
* I could *

35:54.186 --> 35:57.489
* Oh, oh, I'd bathe you *

35:57.589 --> 36:01.693
* Wash you of the sins
that plague you *

36:01.793 --> 36:03.529
* Rid you of the burdens *

36:03.629 --> 36:06.398
* And you'd be free *

36:06.498 --> 36:08.900
* Once more *

36:10.569 --> 36:13.939
* Oh, oh, I'd save you *

36:14.039 --> 36:18.310
* Rid you of the curses
that plague you *

36:18.410 --> 36:20.111
* Give you all the praises *

36:20.212 --> 36:23.615
* Then bring you back *

36:23.715 --> 36:25.517
* To shore... *

36:25.617 --> 36:27.052
I missed you so much, bug.

36:27.152 --> 36:29.187
* And you'd be free
once more... *

36:29.288 --> 36:30.589
(Evelyn chuckles)

36:30.689 --> 36:33.692
How can I ever thank you
for this?

36:33.792 --> 36:35.861
I'm just glad I could help.

36:37.296 --> 36:40.299
Nobody else believed me.

36:40.399 --> 36:41.767
No one.

36:43.335 --> 36:45.737
I couldn't have made it
through this without you.

36:45.837 --> 36:48.740
Well, you were strong enough
to reach out for help.

36:48.840 --> 36:51.310
Everybody doubted you,
but you never gave up.

36:51.410 --> 36:52.778
That's not nothing.

36:52.878 --> 36:56.782
* Warm and clear,
crystal blue... *

36:56.882 --> 36:59.851
Kaylee is a sweet
little girl.

37:00.719 --> 37:02.754
She's lucky to have
you for a mom.

37:02.854 --> 37:06.692
* Rid you of the curses
that plague you *

37:06.792 --> 37:08.193
* Give you all the praises *

37:08.294 --> 37:10.362
* Then bring you back. *

37:10.462 --> 37:13.198
Hey.
Hey.

37:13.299 --> 37:14.300
What's the matter?

37:14.400 --> 37:15.801
I feel bad about
the Pixies show.

37:15.901 --> 37:17.168
Honey, don't worry about it.

37:17.269 --> 37:18.670
I was making a big deal
out of nothing.

37:18.770 --> 37:20.972
No, you weren't.
And it's not nothing.

37:21.072 --> 37:22.608
You know, everything
you went through,

37:22.708 --> 37:24.343
everything I put you through.

37:24.443 --> 37:26.745
All those years I played dead.

37:26.845 --> 37:28.514
Look, at least I knew the truth.

37:28.614 --> 37:31.049
If you didn't tell me
you weren't actually dead,

37:31.149 --> 37:33.819
man, I would have killed you.
(chuckles)

37:33.919 --> 37:37.088
Yeah, I believe that.
You know, I loved our old life.

37:37.188 --> 37:39.291
Eating and drinking
our way across the world.

37:39.391 --> 37:43.128
Going to festivals and
concerts and shows and...

37:43.228 --> 37:44.696
the clothing. Mm.

37:44.796 --> 37:46.565
Oh, man, the shopping.
Yeah.

37:46.665 --> 37:48.500
And I want that for us
again, and I promise

37:48.600 --> 37:49.935
it'll happen.

37:50.035 --> 37:52.037
Just, right now, the idea
of going to a show

37:52.137 --> 37:53.972
at the Beacon, just packed
with 3,000 people...

37:54.072 --> 37:56.742
I get it. It's a lot
all at once.

37:56.842 --> 38:00.245
It's something
we will work through.

38:00.346 --> 38:01.480
Okay.

38:01.580 --> 38:03.649
Okay.
Thanks for understanding.

38:03.749 --> 38:05.216
I love you for that.

38:05.317 --> 38:09.655
And, like, a bazillion
other things.

38:09.755 --> 38:14.025
And as a token of my
undying love and gratitude,

38:14.125 --> 38:15.927
I got you a gift.

38:16.027 --> 38:17.996
You got me a present?
I love presents. What is it?

38:18.096 --> 38:18.897
(chuckles)

38:18.997 --> 38:20.999
Okay, now?
Yeah.

38:23.769 --> 38:26.672
What? What is all this?
Oh. Okay.

38:26.772 --> 38:29.007
So, I couldn't bring you
to the Pixies...

38:29.107 --> 38:32.711
(inhales)
...so I brought
the Pixies to you.

38:32.811 --> 38:36.114
Oh, that is so sweet, babe.

38:37.816 --> 38:40.185
(echoing):
Hey!

38:40.285 --> 38:42.554
(laughs)

38:42.654 --> 38:45.491
(rhythmic electric drumbeat)

38:45.591 --> 38:46.625
* Hey *

38:46.725 --> 38:49.060
* Been trying to meet you *

38:49.160 --> 38:52.197
* Ooh *

38:53.131 --> 38:57.235
* Hey, must be a devil
between us *

38:57.335 --> 38:59.838
* Or whores in my head *

38:59.938 --> 39:02.441
* Whores at my door *

39:02.541 --> 39:04.476
* Whores in my bed *

39:04.576 --> 39:06.812
* But hey *

39:07.713 --> 39:12.083
* Where have you *

39:12.183 --> 39:14.486
* Been? *

39:14.586 --> 39:15.621
* Hey *

39:15.721 --> 39:19.758
* If you go, I will surely die *

39:19.858 --> 39:22.828
* We're chai-ained *

39:22.928 --> 39:25.464
* We're
chai-ained *

39:25.564 --> 39:27.733
* We're chai-ained *

39:27.833 --> 39:30.402
* We're chai-ai-ained *

39:30.502 --> 39:32.804
* We're chai-ained *

39:32.904 --> 39:34.606
* We're chai-ained. *

39:37.909 --> 39:39.545
I heard Delilah met Trish.

39:39.645 --> 39:41.980
So when do I get to meet her?
Soon.

39:45.183 --> 39:47.018
Dee...

39:47.118 --> 39:51.356
I owe you an apology
for snapping like that.

39:51.457 --> 39:52.691
That wasn't right.

39:56.094 --> 39:57.796
It's okay.

39:57.896 --> 40:00.365
And come on,
I was being pushy.
No.

40:00.466 --> 40:02.534
You can ask me anything,

40:02.634 --> 40:04.402
it just... (inhales)

40:04.503 --> 40:06.271
I just felt uncomfortable

40:06.371 --> 40:10.075
remembering that time
in my life, that's all.

40:11.710 --> 40:13.211
But why?

40:15.013 --> 40:17.315
I mean, honestly, Auntie,
I mean,

40:17.415 --> 40:18.917
it sounds like
you were a rock star.

40:19.017 --> 40:21.920
Mm, I wish. Not quite.

40:22.020 --> 40:26.458
Dee, back in the day
when I started painting,

40:26.558 --> 40:29.895
I mean, really painting,

40:29.995 --> 40:32.430
I knew that
I'd found my purpose.

40:32.531 --> 40:34.666
I-I was consumed with it.

40:34.766 --> 40:37.102
It was the '80s,
and the art scene

40:37.202 --> 40:40.972
was just popping
with new styles and energy,

40:41.072 --> 40:44.676
and I was right there
at the center of it all.

40:46.244 --> 40:49.981
I was invited to show my work

40:50.081 --> 40:54.185
with a group of
extraordinary artists.

40:55.721 --> 41:00.492
When I got there,
I saw Basquiat's new work.

41:00.592 --> 41:03.328
I was stunned.

41:03.428 --> 41:04.963
I just stood there,

41:05.063 --> 41:08.433
and I realized that

41:08.534 --> 41:11.169
what I was watching

41:11.269 --> 41:13.438
was genius.

41:13.539 --> 41:15.541
It just shook me
to my core.

41:15.641 --> 41:17.442
And I knew then that

41:17.543 --> 41:21.479
I could not show my work

41:21.580 --> 41:23.849
next to his.

41:26.217 --> 41:28.720
Aunt Vi, it's not fair
to compare yourself

41:28.820 --> 41:31.389
to Basquiat, or anyone else
for that matter.

41:31.489 --> 41:32.658
Exactly.

41:32.758 --> 41:33.859
I mean, you just--

41:33.959 --> 41:36.127
You have a different
voice is all.

41:36.227 --> 41:37.896
Well, I understand
all of that now,

41:37.996 --> 41:41.600
but in that moment...

41:41.700 --> 41:44.636
I just felt exposed.

41:44.736 --> 41:47.906
So I told Trish that

41:48.006 --> 41:50.341
my piece wasn't ready.

41:50.441 --> 41:52.778
But it was.

41:52.878 --> 41:55.881
I was the one
that wasn't ready.

42:04.723 --> 42:06.491
Oh.

42:10.328 --> 42:12.998
It's stunning. Wow.

42:13.799 --> 42:16.001
Aunt Vi,
I gotta be honest.

42:16.101 --> 42:19.237
This does not sound
like you at all.
(Vi chuckles)

42:19.337 --> 42:21.640
But I wasn't the woman then
that I am now, sweetheart.

42:21.740 --> 42:25.176
Well, it's never too late
to jump back into the scene.

42:25.276 --> 42:28.814
I'm not sure that
the passion is still there.

42:28.914 --> 42:30.448
I believe I have missed
that window.

42:31.617 --> 42:33.819
Auntie...

42:35.854 --> 42:37.923
Mm.

42:38.023 --> 42:39.490
I love you.
Mm.

42:39.591 --> 42:42.628
I also know that you are
the most passionate woman

42:42.728 --> 42:44.262
I have ever met.

42:44.362 --> 42:47.465
I know you can do
anything you want to.

42:47.565 --> 42:49.835
No doubt.

42:51.369 --> 42:53.605
The question is,

42:53.705 --> 42:56.474
what do you want to do?
