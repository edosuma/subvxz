Hey, wait.

30:08.263 --> 30:10.531
You remember that neighbor guy
who tried to bring us lemonade?

30:10.565 --> 30:12.733
Yeah. 
Yeah, and he had that story

30:12.768 --> 30:15.336
about lending Leroy his hockey skates.

30:15.370 --> 30:17.739
- What guy brings lemonade?
- You're right.

30:17.773 --> 30:21.543
And if this really is Bobby Orr's skate,
 it's crazy valuable.

30:21.577 --> 30:24.145
What if Leroy's neighbor
was stealing something

30:24.246 --> 30:26.347
from the basement when the
garbage man surprised him?

30:26.448 --> 30:28.016
Maybe friendly neighbor

30:28.083 --> 30:29.617
is really friendly
neighborhood murderer.

30:29.652 --> 30:31.186
Which means we're looking
for the murder weapon

30:31.220 --> 30:32.853
in the wrong house.

30:40.256 --> 30:42.957
That's him ... Mac Hazlet. 

30:42.992 --> 30:45.360
He's quite the successful
e-bay entrepreneur.

30:45.394 --> 30:48.095
<i>Antiques, collectibles,
hockey memorabilia.</i>

30:48.129 --> 30:51.231
Started raking it in
about six months ago.

30:51.299 --> 30:53.233
Leroy broke his hip six months ago.

30:53.268 --> 30:55.435
Frost, see if you can find
the E.R. admissions report.

30:55.503 --> 30:57.038
You thinking Mac discovered

30:57.072 --> 30:58.973
Leroy's antiques road
show in his basement

30:59.007 --> 31:00.508
- and started stealing his stuff?
- Yep.

31:00.542 --> 31:04.712
Wow. Was Mac.
He's listed on the report.

31:04.746 --> 31:06.380
Says he heard Leroy's cries
for help and called 911.

31:06.481 --> 31:08.316
You know something?

31:08.350 --> 31:11.152
Mac needs to pick on
someone his own age.

31:17.827 --> 31:21.363
You sold Terry o'Reilly's hockey glove,
Phil Esposito's stick.

31:21.397 --> 31:23.865
You just listed one
of Bobby Orr's skates.

31:23.900 --> 31:26.468
The left one.
I wonder where the right one is.

31:26.502 --> 31:29.871
Be a lot more valuable as a pair.
I'm a Big Bruins fan.

31:29.906 --> 31:35.211
- Where do you find this great stuff?
- Um, uh, here and there.

31:35.245 --> 31:37.813
Uh, flea markets, private collectors.

31:37.847 --> 31:39.882
So, not next door in Leroy's basement?

31:39.950 --> 31:42.318
[ chuckles ]

31:42.352 --> 31:44.320
I took a few things.

31:44.354 --> 31:47.456
I mean, you know, it was just
sitting there collecting dust.

31:47.491 --> 31:49.375
I-I wanted to put it in the hands of

31:49.376 --> 31:51.260
guys like you who really appreciate it.

31:51.295 --> 31:53.896
Oh, that was really nice
of him, wasn't it, Sergeant?

31:53.931 --> 31:55.632
Korsak: It sure was. What do you think

31:55.633 --> 31:57.333
that murder weapon
you have would be worth

31:57.367 --> 31:59.001
to somebody that collects
that kind of stuff?

31:59.036 --> 32:02.238
What murder weapon?

32:03.407 --> 32:06.509
The metal club you used
to kill the garbage man.

32:06.543 --> 32:08.911
I didn't kill anybody.

32:08.945 --> 32:11.080
Our colleagues are tearing
apart your house as we speak.

32:11.114 --> 32:13.215
- You can't do that.
- A judge said we can.

32:13.249 --> 32:14.550
You could make it easy on everyone.

32:14.584 --> 32:15.951
Just tell us where the murder weapon is.

32:15.985 --> 32:19.488
- I-I'm not telling you crap.
- You're under arrest for larceny.

32:29.965 --> 32:32.933
7:59 A.M.
Do you know what that means?

32:32.968 --> 32:34.468
It was one minute before 8:00?

32:34.503 --> 32:38.005
- And what time do you go on duty?
- 8:00.

32:38.073 --> 32:41.441
The good news is, this is no
longer a police-brutality case.

32:41.476 --> 32:43.543
Oh, that is good news.

32:43.578 --> 32:46.179
- What's the bad news?
- It's a civil matter.

32:46.213 --> 32:48.381
And because you weren't on the clock,

32:48.415 --> 32:51.317
the city's refusing to indemnify you.

32:51.352 --> 32:55.421
You can't be serious.
So I'm on my own?

33:01.094 --> 33:04.096
Look at that ... another 17 cents.

33:04.130 --> 33:06.565
I wonder if F. Lee Bailey
will take your case now.

33:06.600 --> 33:07.967
Mm.

33:08.034 --> 33:10.302
If I tell him to shut up, do you
think he'll put it on youtube?

33:10.336 --> 33:13.972
I wouldn't put it past him.
Okay, where's Maura?

33:14.074 --> 33:16.174
I want to know what that lawyer said.

33:16.209 --> 33:20.111
- [ sighs ] Well?
- I brought Matcha tea.

33:20.146 --> 33:22.347
It's from Utashinai.
You want to try some?

33:22.414 --> 33:23.982
Maura, what did he say? 
[ coins rattle ]

33:24.016 --> 33:25.650
Oh, look, another 50 cents.

33:25.685 --> 33:28.253
Rizzoli, get over here
and help your customers.

33:28.320 --> 33:33.124
- Yes, Mr. Stanley.
- Okay, just tell me what he said.

33:33.158 --> 33:36.628
He said it would be expensive to defend.

33:36.662 --> 33:38.630
- I just spilled coffee.
- I know.

33:38.664 --> 33:42.133
It's a frivolous lawsuit,
but he looked at the video,

33:42.201 --> 33:45.070
and if she has medical expenses
or compensatory damages ...

33:45.137 --> 33:50.675
- For crying out loud.
- Just ... how much is it to hire him?

33:50.710 --> 33:53.011
He wants a $25,000 retainer.

33:53.046 --> 33:57.416
Oh, my god.
Maura, every cent I have is in my condo.

33:58.388 --> 34:00.275
<i>I know.</i>

34:01.453 --> 34:04.322
I know.
I could live in Leroy's basement.

34:04.356 --> 34:06.223
Oh, come on. Let me help you.

34:06.291 --> 34:08.192
You know, I'll just cash
out some mutual funds.

34:08.226 --> 34:10.027
No. I can't take your money.

<i>- [ auto-tuned ] Don't touch me.

34:18.704 --> 34:20.471
Maura, look at her blouse.

34:22.041 --> 34:24.074
They can manufacture
an artificial heart,

34:24.110 --> 34:26.578
but they can't get a polyester
blend to drape properly.

34:26.646 --> 34:28.346
No.

34:28.380 --> 34:31.315
That.
You see it now?

34:31.384 --> 34:34.319
Her blouse is repelling
the droplets of coffee.

34:34.353 --> 34:38.322
Wait, that could be made
of a scald-proof nanofabric.

34:38.358 --> 34:40.225
Help for the fashion-challenged.

34:40.260 --> 34:44.063
Teflon-nanotube coating
is used on some textiles

34:44.097 --> 34:47.933
- to produce scald-proof fabrics.
- So, she set it up.

34:47.967 --> 34:50.069
She even had somebody 
there to tape it.

34:50.103 --> 34:51.737
You think she wanted
you to spill your coffee

34:51.771 --> 34:54.172
so she could sue?
But how'd she know you were a cop?

34:54.239 --> 34:56.274
- I'll be damned.
- What? What do you see?

34:56.309 --> 34:57.976
Whirls and ridges.

34:58.010 --> 34:59.744
Whoever videotaped it left a
fingerprint on the camera lens.

34:59.778 --> 35:02.714
We should run that.

35:02.748 --> 35:07.085
Yes!
Yes!

35:07.119 --> 35:09.087
Oh, yes!

35:09.121 --> 35:12.256
I found the patent.
I know what this is.

35:12.290 --> 35:14.225
It's a piece of a new type
of rotor blade from a drone.

35:14.259 --> 35:17.227
- From a drone?
- Yeah. Manufactured by JFP.

35:17.262 --> 35:19.496
Jarvis Flight Project.

35:19.531 --> 35:21.732
<i>That would explain
the honeycomb interior.</i>

35:21.766 --> 35:25.669
And the edge of the rotor blade
is consistent with the wound pattern.

35:25.704 --> 35:28.272
How does a piece of a drone
end up in Leroy's basement?

35:28.307 --> 35:32.009
Maybe he dragged it inside after
he shot it down with the bug zapper.

35:32.077 --> 35:35.446
E.M.P. would destroy the
drone's electronic system ...

35:35.481 --> 35:37.248
probably cause a power outage, too.

35:37.282 --> 35:39.250
Yeah, but do we know if that even works?

35:39.284 --> 35:42.320
- Oh, yeah. It works.
- Korsak: Really? How do you know that?

35:44.122 --> 35:46.090

fried at the crime scene?

35:49.528 --> 35:52.730
- I think I'll take the fifth.
- Hmm.

35:52.764 --> 35:55.566
Drones can be used for
corporate espionage.

35:55.600 --> 35:59.303
And Leroy was convinced that
he was being watched, spied on.

35:59.337 --> 36:02.339
Spy on an old man's house
with a million-dollar drone?

36:02.407 --> 36:04.774
Maybe they were spying
on the neighborhood.

36:04.809 --> 36:08.144
Frontload Tech just moved
its R&D offices right nearby.

36:08.178 --> 36:10.113
Yeah, but there would
be a ton of firewalls

36:10.147 --> 36:11.748
to protect proprietary information.

36:13.116 --> 36:15.051
[ beeping ]

36:15.086 --> 36:19.222
Yeah, but look at all these houses sold.
Frost, who lives around Leroy?

36:21.258 --> 36:24.193
Frontload Tech engineers.
A lot of them.

36:24.261 --> 36:27.798
That's it. You take your
phone and your computer home.

36:27.832 --> 36:31.168
If I wanted to steal, I would send
a drone, fly it over your home.

36:31.203 --> 36:33.037
It was doing a war-drive ...

36:33.071 --> 36:35.540
piggybacking on wi-fi networks
and downloading everything.

36:35.574 --> 36:39.378
- Frost, look up JFP's website.
- Got it right here.

36:39.412 --> 36:41.414
What else does JFP do?

36:41.448 --> 36:43.783
They offer
intelligence-gathering services.

36:43.817 --> 36:45.451
Look who's head of the division.

36:45.486 --> 36:48.555
We saw him outside Leroy's
house at the standoff.

36:48.589 --> 36:50.690
Jim Blackman ... former Navy Seal,

military-intelligence gathering.

36:58.432 --> 37:00.634
<i>Yeah, except he lives 20 miles away.</i>

37:00.668 --> 37:05.372
Could you track the drone sent
out back to Leroy's basement?

37:05.406 --> 37:07.374
Yes. It had a GPS locator.

37:07.408 --> 37:09.209
This is a picture of
Jim at the crime scene.

37:09.244 --> 37:10.611
He told me he had to get to the office,

37:10.645 --> 37:13.063
but he looks a hell of a lot
more interested about what's

37:13.064 --> 37:15.482
going on inside Leroy's house
than he does in getting to work.

37:15.517 --> 37:17.752
The break-in last night.

37:17.820 --> 37:19.688
It was a huge risk, but
there must be something

37:19.689 --> 37:21.556
inside that house that
ties him to the murder.

37:21.590 --> 37:24.859
But what?
I mean, we went through everything.

37:25.193 --> 37:28.696
What did Leroy have in his
pockets when we brought him in?

37:31.166 --> 37:34.434
69 cents, package of
tums, a rabbit's foot.

37:34.469 --> 37:39.572
And a miniature hard drive.
Can you punch in on that?

37:39.607 --> 37:44.410
It's ... it's hard to see,
but I'm pretty sure it's stamped "JFP."

down my drone and taken it apart.

Where's the hard drive you stole?
