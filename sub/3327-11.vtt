WEBVTT

00:01.360 --> 00:03.590
(kettle whistling)

00:08.370 --> 00:10.463
Are we completely out of mugs?

00:10.510 --> 00:12.330
HOLMES:
Check the sink.

00:12.380 --> 00:14.473
These are ready
for carbon dating.

00:14.510 --> 00:17.479
Ugh... I take it we're
out of clean bowls, too?

00:17.510 --> 00:19.341
And forks and
plates and cups.

00:19.380 --> 00:22.213
Where am I supposed
to put my tea?

00:22.250 --> 00:23.581
This isn't healthy,
you know.

00:23.620 --> 00:26.316
Little marinara is not gonna
kill you, Watson.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.782
No, I mean the state
of your kitchen.

00:27.820 --> 00:29.526
Don't you mean
our kitchen?

00:29.560 --> 00:30.686
No, I mean yours.

00:30.730 --> 00:33.119
I'm only here for ten
more days, remember?

00:33.160 --> 00:35.628
Nine days, 12 hours, 47 minutes,

00:35.660 --> 00:37.525
actually, but who's counting?

00:37.570 --> 00:40.061
I'm just saying,
this is a problem.

00:40.100 --> 00:42.603
This is the sign
of an active mind.

00:42.640 --> 00:44.608
Lincoln,
Einstein, Freud.

00:44.640 --> 00:46.505
All geniuses
who drew inspiration

00:46.540 --> 00:49.247
from chaos in their environs.

00:49.280 --> 00:51.373
Without Andrew Fleming's
reluctance to wash petri dishes,

00:51.410 --> 00:54.140
the world wouldn't _have
penICIllln, would It?

00:54.180 --> 00:55.647
Well, since the world does,
do you have to grow it

00:55.680 --> 00:57.079
in your fridge?

00:57.120 --> 01:01.454
(sighs)
Nine days, 12 hours, 46 minutes.

01:01.490 --> 01:04.129
(speaking Spanish)

01:18.470 --> 01:19.539
(screams)

01:55.540 --> 01:56.746
_Victim's name
IS Teri Purcell.

01:56.780 --> 01:58.907
She's General Manager
of this hotel.

01:58.950 --> 02:01.248
She worked late most nights
in her office.

02:01.280 --> 02:04.647
That's where she
was last seen.

02:04.690 --> 02:07.784
Looks like she died from
blunt-force trauma to the head,

02:07.820 --> 02:09.720
and then she got stuffed
in the machine

02:09.760 --> 02:11.648
to wash away any
physical evidence.

02:11.690 --> 02:14.557
The washer makes it hard to
pinpoint time of death.

02:14.600 --> 02:15.658
Best guess right now
is somewhere between

02:15.700 --> 02:17.429
9:30 and midnight.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.597
Machine was wiped down,
so there's no fingerprints,

02:19.640 --> 02:21.494
except for the maid's
who found her,

02:21.540 --> 02:23.701
and no witnesses,
either.

02:25.440 --> 02:27.829
And _this?
Fountain pen.

02:27.880 --> 02:29.507
It was found in
the washing machine

02:29.550 --> 02:31.245
with the body
and some sheets.

02:31.280 --> 02:33.544
Now, could be the victim's,
could be the killer's.

02:33.580 --> 02:35.741
No way to tell 'cause
there aren't any prints.

02:35.780 --> 02:39.614
Broken in half,
and yet I see no ink at all

02:39.660 --> 02:41.753
on Mrs. Purcell's person,
or the sheets

02:41.790 --> 02:43.485
that were in the washer.

02:43.530 --> 02:46.590
I'm gonna go out on a limb,
and say it was empty.

02:46.630 --> 02:49.724
I noticed that_neither the
security camera In the corridor

02:49.770 --> 02:52.534
nor the one by the exit
door are functioning.

02:52.570 --> 02:53.537
The red power
lights were off.

02:53.570 --> 02:54.730
Yeah, hotel
maintenance said

02:54.770 --> 02:56.863
they've been inactive
for months.

02:56.910 --> 02:59.470
They keep fixing them,
they keep going on the fritz.

02:59.510 --> 03:01.273
Which means the attacker
could come and go

03:01.310 --> 03:02.948
without fear of
being monitored.

03:02.980 --> 03:05.608
Suggests they were familiar
with the environment.

03:05.650 --> 03:07.277
As for these

03:09.490 --> 03:12.482
a distinctive maroon color from
the heels of the victim's shoes.

03:12.520 --> 03:15.318
Similar marks running
the length of the corridor,

03:15.360 --> 03:17.658
meaning she was dragged here
from somewhere else.

03:17.690 --> 03:19.351
You mentioned an office?

03:21.360 --> 03:24.227
Obviously, it looks like
the altercation

03:24.270 --> 03:26.295
may have started here.

03:26.340 --> 03:27.489
Not likely a robbery
gone wrong.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.565
No drawers ransacked

03:29.610 --> 03:30.861
or cabinets left open.

03:30.910 --> 03:32.502
BELL: Well, so far,
all the hotel staff

03:32.540 --> 03:34.838
we've talked to said
Mrs. Purcell is a great boss.

03:34.880 --> 03:36.245
Everyone loved her.

03:36.280 --> 03:37.804
Hm. Because people
are so eager

03:37.850 --> 03:40.671
to speak ill of the dead,
aren't they?

03:40.720 --> 03:42.381
The walls are lined
with awards

03:42.420 --> 03:44.638
and letters of appreciation
for all her charity work.

03:44.690 --> 03:45.839
Yes, well, we're
not so keen

03:45.890 --> 03:47.983
to advertise our
shameful acts, are we?

03:48.020 --> 03:51.251
No, Mrs. Purcell
wanted to be seen

03:51.290 --> 03:53.019
as a friendly,
welcoming person.

03:53.060 --> 03:54.994
It's not enough for
her to be altruistic,

03:55.030 --> 03:56.668
she wants to be
acknowledged for it.

03:56.700 --> 03:58.520
Same goes with
her family.

03:58.570 --> 03:59.537
Here's an observation
for you.

03:59.570 --> 04:01.868
More often than not,
when I find a murdered woman

04:01.900 --> 04:03.436
with a wedding band
on her finger,

04:03.470 --> 04:04.607
the husband's
the one who did it.

04:04.640 --> 04:06.278
I say we talk
to Mr. Purcell,

04:06.310 --> 04:08.699
find out
where he was tonight.

04:09.950 --> 04:12.646
(dog barking)

04:12.680 --> 04:14.568
Ah, suburbia.

04:14.620 --> 04:16.588
Surprised you haven't tried
to get me to move here

04:16.620 --> 04:17.985
in the interest
of my sobriety.

04:18.020 --> 04:19.578
All the "structure"
on display.

04:19.620 --> 04:20.985
Mock me all you want.

04:21.020 --> 04:22.556
Organization is
a form of structure,

04:22.590 --> 04:24.649
and structure is good
for recovery.

04:24.690 --> 04:26.658
After you complained
about the state of the kitchen

04:26.700 --> 04:28.622
last night, I took
a personal inventory.

04:28.660 --> 04:29.627
Assessed myself.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.592
I am excelling
at recovery.

04:31.630 --> 04:33.495
Which tells me that you're
only taking a grim view

04:33.540 --> 04:34.768
of my progress
because you're annoyed

04:34.800 --> 04:37.633
that I'm doing so well.
Right.

04:37.670 --> 04:38.807
I'm upset by
your success,

04:38.840 --> 04:41.434
which is, by association,
my success.

04:41.480 --> 04:42.640
Success at a job
that you don't enjoy.

04:42.680 --> 04:44.739
As opposed to my work,
which invigorates you.

04:44.780 --> 04:47.647
I never denied that
I find what you do
very interesting.

04:47.680 --> 04:49.648
I've decided, Watson:
the lessons can continue

04:49.690 --> 04:51.578
after our companionship ends.

04:51.620 --> 04:52.985
A weekly salon, perhaps.

04:53.020 --> 04:55.352
You could come by,
I could share my wisdom.

04:55.390 --> 04:57.051
In exchange for some light
housework, of course.

04:58.760 --> 04:59.954
GREGSON:
Holmes.

05:04.030 --> 05:06.396
I don't know what to say.
Everybody loved Teri.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.396
My poor daughter
is devastated.

05:08.440 --> 05:10.761
Neither one of us can
figure out why anyone
would hurt her.

05:10.810 --> 05:13.699
GREGSON: Mr. Purcell,
we-we have to ask:

05:13.740 --> 05:15.469
how was your relationship
with your wife?

05:15.510 --> 05:16.772
Everything good?

05:16.810 --> 05:18.038
PURCELL:
Are you asking me that

05:18.080 --> 05:19.775
because you think
I did it?

05:19.820 --> 05:22.482
No, no, we're just trying
to get the whole picture.

05:22.520 --> 05:24.738
I loved my wife.
(sighs)

05:24.790 --> 05:27.588
Things have been as great
as they always were.

05:27.620 --> 05:29.759
Yet you've been sleeping
on the couch lately.

05:29.790 --> 05:31.758
The cushions are compressed

05:31.790 --> 05:34.020
all the way across,
not just in the middle,

05:34.060 --> 05:35.698
like they are when
someone sits on them.

05:35.730 --> 05:36.958
Someone of your
height and weight

05:37.000 --> 05:38.661
has been lying there
for long periods.

05:38.700 --> 05:39.894
I have insomnia.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.738
I can watch TV out here
without keeping Teri up.

05:42.770 --> 05:44.499
That's very
considerate of you.

05:44.540 --> 05:47.031
And... untrue.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.605
The damp towels
and the presence
of your toiletries

05:49.650 --> 05:53.074
in the guest bathroom--
they suggest that your wife

05:53.120 --> 05:54.417
has banished you completely

05:54.450 --> 05:55.872
from the master
bedroom.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.808
(scoffs)
No.

05:57.850 --> 05:59.715
Stress in the marriage
is to be expected,

05:59.760 --> 06:01.751
given your current
unemployment.

06:01.790 --> 06:02.825
Wait, I'm sorry.
H-How did you...

06:02.860 --> 06:04.657
Movie ticket.
It's, uh...

06:04.690 --> 06:06.123
Yesterday.
Monday.

06:06.160 --> 06:07.889
It's for a matinee.

06:07.930 --> 06:10.490
HOLMES:
Hmm? Also, your
printer is full

06:10.530 --> 06:11.827
of high-end card stock.

06:11.870 --> 06:12.894
That's... that's
resume paper.

06:12.940 --> 06:13.964
You're looking for a job.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.536
Dad?

06:15.570 --> 06:16.867
Are you okay?

06:16.910 --> 06:18.502
Carly, hon,

06:18.540 --> 06:20.735
could you please get
our guests some water?

06:20.780 --> 06:21.974
Yeah.

06:22.010 --> 06:24.877
Yeah, of course.

06:24.910 --> 06:27.515
I'll give
you a hand.
Thank you.

06:27.550 --> 06:31.509
Yes, my wife and I have been
having problems, and yes,

06:31.550 --> 06:33.586
I lost my job
as a financial consultant.

06:33.620 --> 06:36.418
Which is why I spent yesterday
evening at a Pink Slip Mixer

06:36.460 --> 06:38.587
with some other
unemployed friends.

06:40.860 --> 06:43.693
Early admission
to Georgetown and Michigan.

06:43.730 --> 06:45.766
Congratulations.
Your mom must have
been really proud.

06:45.800 --> 06:46.892
Yeah.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.828
She was.
Looks like you're

06:48.870 --> 06:50.201
a pretty serious
soccer player.

06:50.240 --> 06:51.832
The coach at Michigan

06:51.870 --> 06:53.428
promised me
that I'd start.

06:53.480 --> 06:54.708
But my mom, she really had

06:54.740 --> 06:57.709
her heart set on Georgetown.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.945
I'm sorry.

06:59.980 --> 07:02.119
Hey...

07:04.220 --> 07:05.983
I keep telling myself,

07:06.020 --> 07:09.922
"Tough times don't last,
tough people do."

07:09.960 --> 07:12.827
And, "this too shall pass."

07:12.860 --> 07:13.997
"This too shall pass."

07:14.030 --> 07:15.952
"Living one day at a time."

07:18.030 --> 07:20.760
I know a lot of people
in recovery.

07:22.570 --> 07:24.800
Yeah.

07:24.840 --> 07:26.831
Um...

07:28.510 --> 07:31.843
A couple of years ago,
I... I hurt my knee.

07:31.880 --> 07:33.916
So...

07:33.950 --> 07:35.941
I started taking pain
pills just to, like,

07:35.980 --> 07:37.811
get through games.

07:37.850 --> 07:40.011
But by the end of the season,
I was just taking them

07:40.060 --> 07:41.880
to get through the day, and...

07:41.920 --> 07:44.650
My mom is the one
who helped me get clean.

07:44.690 --> 07:47.523
You know, I'm gonna give you

07:47.560 --> 07:48.720
my phone number.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.227
If you need to talk,
my phone's on

07:50.270 --> 07:52.465
all the time.

07:59.210 --> 08:00.837
Waste of time, that was.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.768
What?

08:02.810 --> 08:04.573
Coming here.

08:04.610 --> 08:06.771
He clearly has great
confidence in his alibi.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.742
And when I look at him,
I don't see "killer,"

08:08.780 --> 08:10.941
I see "blah."

08:10.990 --> 08:12.878
You want the scoop
on our victim?

08:12.920 --> 08:13.989
Talk to her.

08:14.020 --> 08:16.784
HOLMES:
She's worth talking to

08:16.830 --> 08:19.048
_ because?
She's trimming an evergreen
in the middle of winter.

08:19.090 --> 08:20.955
You're supposed
to do it June.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.524
And the only
thing more important

08:22.570 --> 08:23.923
than a well-maintained lawn
in the suburbs

08:23.970 --> 08:25.699
is gossip.

08:25.730 --> 08:27.960
Teri was a
lovely woman.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.604
Lots of people
thought so.

08:29.640 --> 08:32.302
Men, especially.

08:32.340 --> 08:34.308
Uh, was there any
particular man

08:34.340 --> 08:36.137
you're referring to?

08:36.180 --> 08:38.774
Oh, I wouldn't want
to speak out of school.

08:38.810 --> 08:40.277
Course you wouldn't.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.811
I think Teri
was having an affair.

08:42.850 --> 08:45.318
A very handsome man
used to drop by a lot.

08:45.350 --> 08:47.318
Always when Oliver
wasn't home.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.952
Before he lost his job,
of course.

08:48.990 --> 08:50.981
Could you describe him?

08:51.030 --> 08:53.157
Oh, I can do better than that.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.863
My, uh, friend Sheila
lives over on Oxford.

08:56.900 --> 08:58.868
She refused to believe me
when I told her

08:58.900 --> 09:00.936
that "Saint Teri" was
entertaining a gentleman caller.

09:00.970 --> 09:03.336
So I took this picture as proof.

09:03.370 --> 09:04.735
Hm.

09:04.770 --> 09:05.737
Like I said:

09:05.770 --> 09:08.170
handsome, right?

09:08.210 --> 09:10.644
His license plate is
particularly fetching.

09:13.950 --> 09:17.010
MAN: I'm sorry, I'm...
I'm just... I'm stunned.

09:18.250 --> 09:20.787
Teri was an...
she was an amazrng person.

09:23.060 --> 09:26.086
She volunteered here
from the very beginning.

09:26.130 --> 09:27.893
Please.

09:27.930 --> 09:30.797
In that time and with her help,
our organization

09:30.830 --> 09:33.958
raised money to collect
and destroy over one million

09:34.000 --> 09:35.661
undetonated land mines.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.964
She was as passionate

09:38.010 --> 09:39.978
about our cause as
anyone I've ever known.

09:40.010 --> 09:41.932
Is that _all that she
was passronate about?

09:41.980 --> 09:43.948
Uh, I'm not sure
what you're asking.

09:43.980 --> 09:45.379
Intercourse.

09:45.410 --> 09:47.275
Were you and Teri
having it?

09:47.320 --> 09:49.641
I assume you're referring
to the conversational variety.

09:49.690 --> 09:51.282
No, I meant fornication.

09:51.320 --> 09:53.379
The insertion of
part A Into part...
Mr. Silver,

09:53.420 --> 09:54.910
we are not here

09:54.960 --> 09:56.211
to judge you.
Perish the thought!

09:56.260 --> 09:59.081
No, we're just... simply
inquiring if your time

09:59.130 --> 10:01.257
with Mrs. Purcell
Involved c0Itus.

10:01.300 --> 10:04.827
No. It did not.

10:04.870 --> 10:06.838
Her neighbor seems
to be under the
impression it did.

10:06.870 --> 10:09.759
She said you had a habit
of visiting when Teri's husband

10:09.810 --> 10:11.835
was away.
Well, I visited when he
was there, too.

10:11.870 --> 10:13.178
Oliver was a friend;
I've known him

10:13.210 --> 10:14.837
for as long
as I've known Teri.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.802
Can you account
for your whereabouts

10:16.850 --> 10:18.147
between 9:00 and midnight
last night?

10:18.180 --> 10:20.671
Yes. A friend and his wife
had me over for dinner.

10:20.720 --> 10:23.985
Why?
We'd just like to call
and confirm.

10:24.020 --> 10:25.248
So, if you
wouldn't mind.

10:25.290 --> 10:26.917
Okay.

10:30.060 --> 10:32.119
I don't really care what
you think about me,

10:32.160 --> 10:34.799
but you got the wrong
idea about Teri.

10:34.830 --> 10:36.821
She was as devoted
to her family

10:36.870 --> 10:39.122
as she was to this foundation.

10:39.170 --> 10:41.866
She was, without doubt,
one of the finest human beings

10:41.900 --> 10:44.004
I've ever had the pleasure
of knowing.

10:44.040 --> 10:45.735
Another suspect,

10:45.770 --> 10:47.271
another alibi.

10:47.310 --> 10:49.801
You're angry because that man
and the husband could prove

10:49.850 --> 10:51.147
they didn't commit a murder?

10:51.180 --> 10:52.977
I'm angry because I've
run out of suspects.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.840
At least, for
the time being.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.040
I really liked
that one, too.

10:56.080 --> 10:57.684
Oily.

10:57.720 --> 11:00.314
He helps run a charity
that dismantles landmines.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.918
John Wayne Gacy
gave his time

11:01.960 --> 11:03.029
to several charitable
foundations.

11:03.060 --> 11:05.358
Does that make him
a good person, too?

11:05.390 --> 11:06.948
So, that was the captain.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.798
He talked to head of security
at Teri Purcell's hotel.

11:09.830 --> 11:12.424
Now he said they had
a prostitution problem recently.

11:12.470 --> 11:15.792
Some guests got solicited
in the hotel bar and complained.

11:15.840 --> 11:18.468
Now, Teri cracked down,
cleared out the working girls.

11:18.510 --> 11:21.104
A few weeks later, she gets some
threatening anonymous calls.

11:21.140 --> 11:22.744
Probably from
their pimps.

11:22.780 --> 11:24.042
Yeah, I'm gonna
head to Vice,

11:24.080 --> 11:26.207
see who might be running
hookers at high-end hotels.

11:26.250 --> 11:28.377
You want to come?

11:28.420 --> 11:30.285
I appreciate the
offer, Detective,

11:30.320 --> 11:33.983
but I've just realized that
Watson and I have a thing.

11:34.020 --> 11:35.817
All right.

11:35.860 --> 11:37.088
Mm.

11:37.130 --> 11:38.950
A thing?

11:38.990 --> 11:40.924
Why go to Vice to
explore the problem

11:40.960 --> 11:42.996
when we can go
directly to the source?

11:43.030 --> 11:46.466
Tell me, have you ever
been whore-fishing?

11:46.500 --> 11:49.469
Her?

11:49.500 --> 11:52.105
Too obvious.
Too intoxicated.

11:52.140 --> 11:53.835
High-end escorts

11:53.880 --> 11:55.177
are more polished, discreet.

11:55.210 --> 11:58.179
Mark my words. No one
is going to take you seriously

11:58.210 --> 12:01.008
as an investigator if
you can't spot a fille de joie

12:01.050 --> 12:02.472
at 20 paces.

12:02.520 --> 12:04.147
What is the point of this again?

12:04.190 --> 12:05.839
As Detective Bell suggested.

12:05.890 --> 12:07.050
If Teri Purcell ran afoul

12:07.090 --> 12:08.910
of the working girls
in her establishment,

12:08.960 --> 12:10.882
it may well have led
to her death.

12:10.930 --> 12:12.352
Who better to fill in the holes,

12:12.390 --> 12:14.028
as it were,
than the strumpets themselves?

12:14.060 --> 12:16.051
Teri Purcell is the one

12:16.100 --> 12:18.227
who put a ban on them
in the hotel.

12:18.270 --> 12:20.261
And how do you know
any of these women are...?

12:20.300 --> 12:22.393
(whispers):
...are call girls?

12:22.440 --> 12:25.432
When the cat's away,
the mice will play.

12:25.470 --> 12:28.030
In this case, the cat
got his skull caved in.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.229
The mice are
the prostitutes.

12:29.280 --> 12:31.100
I get it. Ijust think

12:31.150 --> 12:32.879
your mouse hunt
is a little misogynistic.

12:32.920 --> 12:35.377
Not misogynistic.
Anthropological.

12:35.420 --> 12:38.116
The species we are
looking for is attractive,

12:38.150 --> 12:40.459
well-dressed,
quick to laugh,

12:40.490 --> 12:42.788
and highly-skilled at
spotting out-of-town men

12:42.830 --> 12:46.254
whose desires are not
being fulfilled at home.

12:46.290 --> 12:48.394
Like her.

12:54.570 --> 12:57.107
Excuse me.

12:57.140 --> 12:59.108
Might we offer you a drink
and some company?

12:59.140 --> 13:00.801
Oh, a drink
would be lovely.

13:00.840 --> 13:02.432
Excellent.
Now that's out of the way.

13:02.480 --> 13:05.074
My friend and I were
wondering what you might charge

13:05.110 --> 13:06.145
to sleep with us.

13:06.180 --> 13:07.511
Just kidding.

13:07.550 --> 13:09.370
We work with the police,
and, uh, we were wondering

13:09.420 --> 13:11.843
if you or any of your fellow
working girls might know

13:11.890 --> 13:13.482
who killed the manager
in the hotel last night.

13:13.520 --> 13:17.081
Oh, I'm sorry. I think that
you have wrong idea about me.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.324
Do I now? I know your clothes--

13:18.360 --> 13:19.896
they say
sophisticated businesswoman,

13:19.930 --> 13:21.454
but the faint line
across your thighs says

13:21.500 --> 13:23.195
garter belt
with stockings.

13:23.230 --> 13:25.061
And you've made
meaningful eye contact

13:25.100 --> 13:26.897
with almost every unattached man
in here, even the paunchy ones.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.168
Now, should I alert

13:28.200 --> 13:29.394
security to your presence,

13:29.440 --> 13:31.169
or would you mind
just-just answering

13:31.210 --> 13:33.371
just a couple of questions, hmm?

13:33.410 --> 13:36.038
What do you want
to know?

13:36.080 --> 13:39.345
As I said, the manager of the
hotel was killed last night.

13:39.380 --> 13:42.178
We're investigating
the possibility

13:42.220 --> 13:43.517
that one of your managers

13:43.550 --> 13:45.086
may have had something
to do with it.

13:45.120 --> 13:47.918
Why would any of those guys
want to kill Teri?

13:47.960 --> 13:50.155
So, you knew her?
Of course.

13:50.190 --> 13:52.021
We all did.
But trust me,

13:52.060 --> 13:54.893
none of our managers would
ever lay a finger on her.

13:54.930 --> 13:56.295
Not in a million years.

13:56.330 --> 13:58.969
How can you be so sure?

13:59.000 --> 14:03.869
Because... she was the reason
that most of us worked here.

14:03.910 --> 14:06.504
We were told that
she-she chased you all out

14:06.540 --> 14:09.509
because some of the
hotel guests complained.

14:09.540 --> 14:11.872
Oh, she just helped us
to keep a lower profile.

14:11.910 --> 14:13.241
She would sneak us
in the back,

14:13.280 --> 14:16.249
put us up in the service
elevators to meet the clients.

14:16.280 --> 14:18.214
She wanted us here.

14:18.250 --> 14:20.184
(clears throat)

14:20.220 --> 14:24.486
Now, if you two decide
you ever do want a date...

14:24.530 --> 14:27.055
call me.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.318
I think
we'd have some fun.

14:43.210 --> 14:46.202
GREGSON:
So far, every hooker
we've talked to has said

14:46.250 --> 14:48.172
the same thing.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.347
Ever since Teri Purcell
took over the hotel in '09,

14:50.390 --> 14:52.381
she's been arranging
dates with rich businessmen

14:52.420 --> 14:54.513
and diplomats that were
visiting from the UN.

14:54.560 --> 14:57.188
Couple of months ago,
someone started complaining

14:57.230 --> 14:59.528
about the prostitutes
in the lobby.

14:59.560 --> 15:01.699
So she started moving them
through the laundry area,

15:01.730 --> 15:03.391
where she'd sabotaged
the security cameras.

15:03.430 --> 15:05.125
_ When their
busmess was complete,

15:05.170 --> 15:06.523
she'd sneak 'em back out.

15:06.570 --> 15:08.367
Now, get ready
for the weird part.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.129
She did it all for free.

15:10.170 --> 15:12.263
You're saying she was
a volunteer madam?

15:12.310 --> 15:14.574
According to the girls
who worked there,

15:14.610 --> 15:18.273
yeah-- their pimps loved her.
What about

15:18.310 --> 15:19.447
the threatening phone calls
she received?

15:19.480 --> 15:21.345
They say that they came
from the one girl

15:21.380 --> 15:22.574
that she did have to ban.

15:22.620 --> 15:24.178
The girl got high in the lobby,

15:24.220 --> 15:25.619
made a scene,
so she had to cut her off.

15:25.650 --> 15:27.413
We tracked her down.

15:27.460 --> 15:29.587
She's six months
into a bid for possession,

15:29.620 --> 15:31.178
so she's not our killer.

15:31.230 --> 15:34.427
Wyatt? Excuse me.

15:34.460 --> 15:36.257
I don't get it.

15:36.300 --> 15:38.165
Why would Teri Purcell
risk her career

15:38.200 --> 15:40.634
to run a non-profit brothel
out of her hotel?

15:40.670 --> 15:43.036
House of secrets,
that place.

15:43.070 --> 15:46.267
Perhaps it warrants
a second look.

15:50.180 --> 15:51.738
You know, it occurs to me

15:51.780 --> 15:55.147
that once you've accepted
my offer of an apprenticeship,

15:55.180 --> 15:56.613
you should probably
start taking notes.

15:56.650 --> 16:01.019
I'm not becoming
your apprentice.

16:01.060 --> 16:03.722
No, of course not.
Not in an official capacity.

16:03.760 --> 16:05.421
More likely
you'll peddle some fiction

16:05.460 --> 16:08.588
to my father about me not
being ready to be alone yet.

16:08.630 --> 16:10.564
Hmm? Whatever your
pride dictates,

16:10.600 --> 16:14.229
I shan't hold it against you.

16:14.270 --> 16:16.488
You know I'm not staying, right?

16:16.540 --> 16:20.704
What? And continue
your journey to profound

16:20.740 --> 16:22.401
professional satisfaction?

16:22.440 --> 16:25.079
Why would you?

16:27.120 --> 16:29.748
What are you doing?

16:29.780 --> 16:34.217
Secret compartments have been
a part of cabinet-making

16:34.260 --> 16:36.387
since the Age of Enlightenment.

16:36.420 --> 16:38.524
You know, I once spent
a thrilling afternoon

16:38.560 --> 16:40.699
examining
a Queen Anne secretary

16:40.730 --> 16:42.755
with no fewer
than 25 hidden caches.

16:53.140 --> 16:56.303
What is it?

16:56.340 --> 16:59.400
Well, it's a compact,
but it's...

16:59.450 --> 17:01.645
it's a very heavy compact.

17:03.120 --> 17:05.384
It's not even Teri's shade.

17:05.420 --> 17:07.149
She's much more of a winter.

17:07.190 --> 17:08.418
Hmm.

17:14.430 --> 17:16.318
See here...

17:16.360 --> 17:19.363
wireless connector.

17:19.400 --> 17:21.368
And with this,
Teri could

17:21.400 --> 17:25.507
sign in to an entirely
private network.

17:31.610 --> 17:33.248
WATSON:
Hidden cameras.

17:33.280 --> 17:35.578
Nine hidden cameras.

17:35.620 --> 17:37.747
Well, I think I've worked out

17:37.790 --> 17:39.382
how Teri was profiting

17:39.420 --> 17:41.115
from her arrangement
with the hookers.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.855
(elevator bell dings)
Blackmail.

17:42.890 --> 17:45.085
It would explain why Teri
allowed the prostitutes

17:45.130 --> 17:48.395
to work at her hotel, but never
took a cut of the money, hmm?

17:48.430 --> 17:50.421
She gave them access,
arranged their dates.

17:50.470 --> 17:51.823
They gave her
the opportunity

17:51.870 --> 17:54.134
to capture guests on film
in flagrante delicto.

17:54.170 --> 17:56.297
Well, if you're right,
that means every guest

17:56.340 --> 17:58.729
she ever blackmailed is a
potential suspect In her murder.

17:58.770 --> 18:00.374
Correct.

18:00.410 --> 18:03.299
You said you found a couple
of thousand hours of footage?

18:03.350 --> 18:04.840
The cameras ran 24/7.

18:04.880 --> 18:06.507
Unfortunately, there
are no time stamps

18:06.550 --> 18:08.211
or references
on the Videos.

18:08.250 --> 18:10.445
Which means, it'll
probably take forever

18:10.490 --> 18:12.446
to identify the guests

18:12.490 --> 18:15.311
who performed
blackmail-worthy
acts on tape.

18:15.360 --> 18:16.657
I'm gonna need teams

18:16.690 --> 18:19.523
working on shifts to
get through it all.

18:19.560 --> 18:20.857
It's gonna take days.

18:20.900 --> 18:23.698
Not necessarily.

18:41.280 --> 18:43.441
Do I even want to know

18:43.490 --> 18:45.139
what happened?

18:45.190 --> 18:46.441
You haven't missed a thing.

18:46.490 --> 18:48.412
More yak than shack so far.

18:49.590 --> 18:51.649
Curiously, many of these videos

18:51.690 --> 18:53.555
are entirely prostitute-free.

18:53.600 --> 18:54.851
I meant the garbage.

18:54.900 --> 18:56.595
Borrowed our neighbor's bin

18:56.630 --> 18:58.495
to test your theory
about physical mess

18:58.530 --> 18:59.895
and its correlation to relapse.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.568
I've been sitting here
for hours,

19:01.600 --> 19:03.602
and_I_ haven't felt _
any additional temptation

19:03.640 --> 19:04.800
to use drugs.

19:04.840 --> 19:06.728
We'll see howI am
in the morning.

19:06.770 --> 19:09.603
(phone ringing)

19:09.640 --> 19:11.346
(sighs)

19:17.490 --> 19:19.242
Hello?

19:19.290 --> 19:20.655
CARLY:
Is-is this Miss Watson?

19:20.690 --> 19:22.317
Yes.

19:22.360 --> 19:24.624
Hi. It's, um...
it's Carly Purcell.

19:24.660 --> 19:26.787
You-you gave me your number
the other day.

19:26.830 --> 19:28.627
Yes.

19:28.660 --> 19:30.764
I'm glad you called.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.529
Is everything okay?

19:32.570 --> 19:34.197
Yeah-- yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:34.240 --> 19:35.832
I haven't taken any pills
or anything.

19:35.870 --> 19:38.464
Ijust...

19:38.510 --> 19:41.502
I-I just needed
to talk to someone.

19:41.540 --> 19:43.599
Okay. Well, I'm here.

19:43.650 --> 19:45.470
You sound upset.

19:45.510 --> 19:47.978
You know what?
I-I don't even know you.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.612
This was stupid. I-I...

19:49.650 --> 19:51.311
No. I told you to call me

19:51.350 --> 19:53.511
if you wanted to talk,
and you... and you called.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.209
Just...

19:55.260 --> 19:57.922
My-my mom.

19:57.960 --> 20:00.690
I don't know.
The way she was.

20:00.730 --> 20:04.461
She... she's not...
she's not what people thought.

20:04.500 --> 20:05.626
What do you mean?

20:07.570 --> 20:11.336
Carly, tell me where you are,
and I will come and meet you.

20:12.670 --> 20:14.501
I'm really sorry,

20:14.540 --> 20:16.303
but I... I've got to go.

20:16.340 --> 20:18.706
(line clicks)

20:21.920 --> 20:23.683
Hey.

20:23.720 --> 20:26.518
I thought you'd still be looking
at that secret camera video.

20:26.550 --> 20:28.484
I finished an hour ago.

20:28.520 --> 20:30.010
But it turns out,
the photographs

20:30.060 --> 20:31.880
hidden in Mrs. Purcell's
computer

20:31.930 --> 20:33.522
are far more interesting.

20:33.560 --> 20:35.425
So, Teri had
dirty pictures, too?

20:35.460 --> 20:36.927
Uh-uh.

20:43.670 --> 20:45.399
Wait. It gets better.

20:45.440 --> 20:47.704
I know what you're thinking.

20:47.740 --> 20:49.731
Innocuous. Mundane.

20:49.780 --> 20:51.702
But each of these
stultifying images

20:51.750 --> 20:54.378
contains almost
a gig of memory.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.671
That's enormous.

20:55.720 --> 20:57.688
Mm. That's steganography,

20:57.720 --> 21:00.450
the science of embedding
hidden messages in plain sight,

21:00.490 --> 21:02.617
security through obscurity.

21:02.660 --> 21:05.322
So, you're saying that Teri's
picture files are so large

21:05.360 --> 21:06.952
because she has content
hidden in them.

21:06.990 --> 21:08.958
Mm. Luckily, I have
a decryption program

21:09.000 --> 21:13.061
that should unlock
the coded data

21:13.100 --> 21:14.658
in a matter of minutes.

21:16.670 --> 21:17.830
Carly called me

21:17.870 --> 21:19.599
last night.

21:19.640 --> 21:20.834
I didn't mention it

21:20.880 --> 21:22.768
because she confided in me
the other day.

21:22.810 --> 21:24.368
About her drug use?

21:25.610 --> 21:27.009
I overheard a snippet
of conversation

21:27.050 --> 21:29.018
while I was questioning
her father.

21:29.050 --> 21:30.642
It didn't seem relevant.

21:30.690 --> 21:32.009
Has it become relevant?

21:32.050 --> 21:33.654
Well, she did mention something
about her mother

21:33.690 --> 21:35.089
not being the person
that everyone thought

21:35.120 --> 21:36.678
she was.

21:36.720 --> 21:37.948
I must warn you, Watson.

21:37.990 --> 21:39.548
Whatever's on these videos
is likely

21:39.590 --> 21:42.650
to be the vilest
and most startling material

21:42.700 --> 21:44.099
that Mrs. Purcell
gathered,

21:44.130 --> 21:46.724
so you might not
want to watch this.

21:47.700 --> 21:50.828
Okay.

21:50.870 --> 21:53.475
(men speaking Farsi)

21:53.510 --> 21:55.501
(man speaking French)

21:55.540 --> 21:57.644
Wow. Yeah, I don't know how

21:57.680 --> 21:59.671
I'm ever going
to unsee any of that.

21:59.710 --> 22:01.109
Shh.

22:01.150 --> 22:03.618
(men speaking French, Farsi)

22:10.830 --> 22:13.025
What? What, who
are you calling?

22:13.060 --> 22:14.698
Captain Gregson.

22:14.730 --> 22:17.665
We need to go back to the
Purcell home immediately.

22:17.700 --> 22:20.089
Why? Because some
French guy is putting on
too much deodorant?

22:20.130 --> 22:22.439
It's not what the people
in these videos are doing,

22:22.470 --> 22:25.030
Watson, it's what
they're saying.

22:25.070 --> 22:27.436
(sirens approaching)

22:29.910 --> 22:31.104
(siren blaring)

22:31.150 --> 22:32.902
(tires screeching)

22:34.820 --> 22:37.789
(indistinct radio transmission)

22:37.820 --> 22:39.640
You're quite good,
you know that?

22:39.690 --> 22:41.783
You really had me
going the other day.

22:41.820 --> 22:42.787
Beg your pardon?

22:42.820 --> 22:44.629
Your accent,
your attire,

22:44.660 --> 22:46.753
your dcor-- it all virtually
screams "average American."

22:46.790 --> 22:48.826
Except you're
neither, are you?

22:48.860 --> 22:51.795
Someone want _to tell me
what the hell is g0ing on here?

22:51.830 --> 22:53.889
Yeah, you're a... a spy.

22:53.940 --> 22:55.760
So was your late wife.

22:55.800 --> 22:57.529
What?

22:57.570 --> 22:59.629
We have a warrant to search
your home, Mr. Purcell.

22:59.670 --> 23:00.739
OLIVER:
Based on what?

23:00.780 --> 23:02.509
GREGSON:
Based on your secret videos

23:02.540 --> 23:04.974
that your wife made with
her "globally relevant" guests.

23:05.010 --> 23:07.171
HOLMES:
At first I thought
she was using them

23:07.210 --> 23:09.019
as blackmail--
why else would she

23:09.050 --> 23:11.518
facilitate a prostitution
ring in her own hotel

23:11.550 --> 23:13.586
and collect _
none of the profits?

23:13.620 --> 23:14.757
Now I have the answer.

23:14.790 --> 23:16.758
The escorts made
the hotel popular

23:16.790 --> 23:18.678
amongst international
power brokers,

23:18.730 --> 23:21.028
foreign businessmen,
diplomats visiting

23:21.060 --> 23:22.459
the nearby UN--

23:22.500 --> 23:24.024
only it wasn't
their bad behavior

23:24.070 --> 23:25.765
that Teri wanted
caught on tape,

23:25.800 --> 23:27.438
_it was their
information.

23:27.470 --> 23:28.732
I imagine that
while she was

23:28.770 --> 23:30.761
collecting intelligence
from her place of business,

23:30.810 --> 23:33.472
you were doing the same
at your financial
consulting firm?

23:33.510 --> 23:36.729
I was fired months ago.
No. You resigned.

23:36.780 --> 23:39.772
Your firm recently
signed a contract with
the Department of Defense.

23:39.810 --> 23:41.539
GREGSON: The DoD would have
required a thorough

23:41.580 --> 23:43.480
background check on everyone
that worked at the company.

23:43.520 --> 23:45.215
You knew your legend
wouldn't hold up

23:45.250 --> 23:46.740
to that level of scrutiny.

23:46.790 --> 23:48.587
"Legend"?

23:48.620 --> 23:50.087
The elaborate
and utterly false identities

23:50.120 --> 23:51.758
provided by your
Russian spymasters

23:51.790 --> 23:54.452
for you and your wife
to pass as American citizens.

23:54.500 --> 23:56.718
Oh, so now I'm not only a spy,
I'm a Russian spy?

23:56.760 --> 23:58.796
You made a point
of stepping out

23:58.830 --> 24:00.024
to shake hands the other day.

24:00.070 --> 24:01.731
It's bad form
in Russian culture

24:01.770 --> 24:02.964
to shake hands
beneath the arch

24:03.000 --> 24:05.002
of a doorway, is it not?
Then there were

24:05.040 --> 24:07.634
the coins that your wife left
lying around in her office.

24:07.680 --> 24:10.001
In Russian folklore,
money goes to money.

24:10.040 --> 24:13.715
Leaving coins out is
a way of inviting good
fortune into your life.

24:13.750 --> 24:17.481
Didn't quite work out for her,
though, did it?

24:17.520 --> 24:18.646
Listen to me.

24:18.690 --> 24:19.816
If what happened to Teri

24:19.850 --> 24:21.818
had anything to do
with her spying,

24:21.860 --> 24:24.181
now would be
the time to tell us.

24:25.930 --> 24:28.057
I want a lawyer.

24:28.100 --> 24:31.024
Yeah, I would expect
that you would.

24:36.070 --> 24:38.834
Just got off the phone
with the Feds.

24:38.870 --> 24:40.679
They're on their way down.

24:40.710 --> 24:42.029
Can I question
Oliver now?

24:42.080 --> 24:44.503
GREGSON:
This is a joint investigation.

24:44.550 --> 24:48.179
NYPD handles the homicide;
FBI handles the espionage.

24:48.220 --> 24:50.745
The homicide
and the espionage
are the same thing.

24:50.790 --> 24:53.850
We wait. As it is, we're lucky
they're letting us sit in.

24:53.890 --> 24:56.256
Oh, yeah, by all means,
let's express our gratitude

24:56.290 --> 24:57.882
to the lurching,
inept bureaucracy

24:57.930 --> 25:00.524
that is preventing us
from questioning a suspect

25:00.560 --> 25:02.528
who sits not
ten feet away!

25:02.560 --> 25:03.822
Oh, good, you're here.

25:03.870 --> 25:06.794
He's doing
his tantrum thing.

25:06.830 --> 25:08.889
WATSON:
I've been trying
to get ahold of Carly

25:08.940 --> 25:10.760
since I heard you
picked up her father.

25:10.810 --> 25:12.607
Has anyone heard from her?
Well, she
wasn't home

25:12.640 --> 25:14.676
when we went
to pick up Oliver,

25:14.710 --> 25:16.075
so we left a uniform
at the house.

25:16.110 --> 25:17.941
She's 17 years old
and she's in crisis.

25:17.980 --> 25:20.107
Her mother was just murdered,
and she's about to find out

25:20.150 --> 25:21.674
that both her parents
are Russian spies.

25:21.720 --> 25:22.778
We need to find her.

25:22.820 --> 25:24.685
She's right.
Carly could be

25:24.720 --> 25:27.109
in danger, especially
if she was part of
her parents' operation.

25:27.150 --> 25:29.710
I talked to this girl--
she is a confused teenager,

25:29.760 --> 25:30.886
not a sleeper agent.

25:30.930 --> 25:31.988
And now she's alone.

25:33.860 --> 25:36.124
Spies are never alone.

25:36.160 --> 25:37.866
They have handlers.

25:37.900 --> 25:39.868
SILVER:
And I know you probably have

25:39.900 --> 25:41.834
some figure in the back
of your mind for how much...

25:41.870 --> 25:43.701
I was wrong about you, Geoffrey.

25:43.740 --> 25:46.903
What?! We're in a meeting here.

25:46.940 --> 25:48.134
Ladies and gentlemen,
kudos to you

25:48.180 --> 25:49.932
for your attraction
to such a worthy cause.

25:49.980 --> 25:51.845
The fact that
I'm about to demonstrate

25:51.880 --> 25:53.871
that Mr. Silver is
actually a Ru55ian spy

25:53.920 --> 25:55.842
should by no means
discourage you from giving,

25:55.880 --> 25:57.313
and giving generously.

25:57.350 --> 25:59.841
I don't know what the hell
you are talking about,

25:59.890 --> 26:01.983
but all three of you
need to leave.

26:02.020 --> 26:03.726
You provided Oliver
and Teri Purcell

26:03.760 --> 26:05.227
with cash, cover,
resources,

26:05.260 --> 26:07.797
ferried their stolen secrets
back to Mother Russia,

26:07.830 --> 26:10.196
all under the guise of your
international charity work.

26:10.230 --> 26:12.369
Quite a brilliant cover,
actually.

26:12.400 --> 26:14.630
That is the craziest thing
I've ever heard.

26:14.670 --> 26:17.764
Is it? Well, we know
that Teri Purcell was
working as a spy,

26:17.810 --> 26:19.607
and she was passing
video recordings

26:19.640 --> 26:21.676
hidden behind
mundane photographs
via steganography.

26:21.710 --> 26:24.907
It just so happens one
of those photographs was
open on your desktop

26:24.950 --> 26:26.941
two days ago.
Do you mind ifI pull it up

26:26.980 --> 26:28.948
so I can show Detective Bell?
Yes. Abso...

26:28.980 --> 26:30.618
No, I do; I do mind.

26:30.650 --> 26:32.049
Would you get him
out of here?

26:32.090 --> 26:34.012
I'm quite happy
to leave by myself, actually.

26:34.060 --> 26:35.948
Just tell me everything you know
about who killed Teri Purcell.

26:35.990 --> 26:38.220
Oh, my God, I don't
know who killed Teri.

26:38.260 --> 26:39.955
Now, if looking
in my computer

26:39.990 --> 26:42.629
is gonna get you to leave,
then fine, go ahead.

26:42.660 --> 26:44.059
Thank you.

26:45.800 --> 26:48.997
(Holmes typing)

26:53.980 --> 26:55.106
It's no longer there.

26:55.140 --> 26:56.971
Obviously, someone

26:57.010 --> 26:59.046
just scrubbed it clean.

26:59.080 --> 27:02.117
If you're convinced
that I'm a spy...

27:02.150 --> 27:04.038
arrest me.

27:04.090 --> 27:06.240
Otherwise,
you got to go.

27:06.290 --> 27:08.258
(phone ringing)

27:08.290 --> 27:10.724
HOLMES (over phone):
Captain Gregson,
how may I be of assistance?

27:10.760 --> 27:13.388
Oliver Purcell's agreed
to talk to us and the FBI.

27:13.430 --> 27:16.729
I told the Feds we wouldn't
have found the guy without you.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.365
They said you could
sit in, all right?

27:19.400 --> 27:23.905
Our handlers thought we'd
work well together as a couple.

27:23.940 --> 27:25.259
Not because
we were in love.

27:25.310 --> 27:26.766
Our relationship

27:26.810 --> 27:28.698
was never romantic, it was...

27:28.740 --> 27:30.947
a patriotic transaction.

27:30.980 --> 27:33.107
But Carly is
your biological daughter,

27:33.150 --> 27:34.412
(over speaker):
correct?

27:34.450 --> 27:37.374
OLIVER:
That was two operatives
obeying orders.

27:37.420 --> 27:41.413
We started having sex when
we were urged to conceive.

27:41.460 --> 27:44.725
Stopped when
Teri got pregnant.

27:44.760 --> 27:47.058
Once we had Carly, we...

27:47.090 --> 27:49.399
looked more like_
a real American family.

27:49.430 --> 27:51.762
But...

27:51.800 --> 27:53.995
you can't raise a spy.

27:56.040 --> 27:58.838
Teri and I found ourselves
with a daughter.

27:58.870 --> 28:01.134
I may not have loved Teri,

28:01.180 --> 28:04.149
but we both loved Carly.

28:04.180 --> 28:06.978
When did you initiate her
into the family business?

28:07.010 --> 28:09.843
Come on, Mr. Purcell,

28:09.880 --> 28:12.041
the Russians invested
a great deal of time and money

28:12.090 --> 28:13.717
into your family--
they must have had

28:13.760 --> 28:16.718
a plan for Carly.
They did.

28:16.760 --> 28:19.228
But I worked 20 years
for the SVR,

28:19.260 --> 28:21.728
living a lie.

28:21.760 --> 28:24.399
I wanted more for my daughter.

28:24.430 --> 28:26.022
WOMAN:
You and your wife

28:26.070 --> 28:28.231
see eye to eye
on that?
No.

28:28.270 --> 28:30.761
Teri wanted
to tell Carly.

28:30.810 --> 28:34.337
To Teri, serving Russia
was still the highest calling.

28:34.380 --> 28:37.099
That's got to be a hard
disagreement to resolve.

28:37.140 --> 28:39.370
It was.

28:39.410 --> 28:43.016
And so I... threatened
to expose the operation.

28:43.050 --> 28:46.042
Said I'd take my chances
with the US. Government

28:46.090 --> 28:48.479
before I let the SVR
use my daughter.

28:48.520 --> 28:51.159
That was enough
to shut Teri and Geoffrey up.

28:51.190 --> 28:54.159
Geoffrey Silver,
your handler?

28:54.200 --> 28:55.758
HOLMES:
Hm.

28:55.800 --> 28:58.428
_I believe that
constitutes a p05itive I.D.

28:58.470 --> 29:01.769
_ on Mr. _Silver'_s
involvement in espionage.

29:01.800 --> 29:05.429
OLIVER: Look,
I don't know who killed Teri,
(phone vibrating)

29:05.470 --> 29:07.461
but I'll plead guilty
to the rest of it,

29:07.510 --> 29:09.273
tell you everything I know,

29:09.310 --> 29:11.870
but only if you
leave Carly alone.

29:11.910 --> 29:14.276
She's innocent.

29:15.880 --> 29:19.839
Put that in writing,
and I'm yours.

29:19.890 --> 29:21.357
Hey, Carly.

29:21.390 --> 29:23.153
Are you okay?

29:23.190 --> 29:24.828
I was coming home last night

29:24.860 --> 29:26.851
when I saw the police
taking my dad away.

29:26.890 --> 29:29.256
What's going on, Ms. Watson?

29:29.300 --> 29:32.827
He's just answering
some questions right now.

29:32.870 --> 29:34.997
D-Do they think he had
something to do with my mom?

29:35.040 --> 29:35.995
'Cause he didn't!

29:36.040 --> 29:38.008
Okay, tell me where you are,

29:38.040 --> 29:41.134
and I'll come_
and meet you, all right?

29:41.180 --> 29:43.068
CARLY:
Thanks for meeting me.

29:43.110 --> 29:45.305
It's been a rough couple
of days, you know?

29:45.350 --> 29:48.171
Of course. I get it.

29:48.220 --> 29:49.517
(sniffles)

29:49.550 --> 29:51.347
Carly, you said
the other night

29:51.390 --> 29:54.188
that your mom wasn't who
everyone thought she was.

29:54.220 --> 29:57.155
Did you know
she was a spy?

30:00.490 --> 30:03.095
And your father, too?

30:04.970 --> 30:08.064
How long have
you known for?

30:08.100 --> 30:12.036
(crying): My mom told me
a few days ago.

30:12.070 --> 30:16.234
That's a lot
for anyone to process.

30:16.280 --> 30:19.374
My father shouldn't be
under arrest-- it's my fault.

30:19.410 --> 30:22.470
You can't take on
your parents' mistakes.
You don't understand.

30:22.520 --> 30:25.341
I'm the one who's responsible.

30:25.390 --> 30:27.984
I killed my mother.

30:33.260 --> 30:35.490
I, um, I got
my letter of acceptance

30:35.530 --> 30:37.259
from Michigan that day.

30:37.300 --> 30:39.928
Full athletic scholarship.

30:39.970 --> 30:42.291
The first thing I do
is call my mom,

30:42.340 --> 30:45.969
'cause I figured she'd be
as thrilled as I was.

30:48.440 --> 30:49.907
(Carly sobs)

30:50.950 --> 30:52.406
It's okay, Carly.

30:52.450 --> 30:54.418
Just try to tell us
what happened.

30:54.450 --> 30:57.078
She just...
she sounded weird.

30:57.120 --> 31:01.216
She told me that I
had to go straight
to the hotel, and so I did.

31:01.260 --> 31:03.353
And when I got there,
she told me that Michigan

31:03.390 --> 31:05.654
was out of the question,
that I was going to Georgetown,

31:05.690 --> 31:09.990
and... and I didn't understand
why she was being so insistent.

31:10.030 --> 31:12.328
But then she
explained why.

31:12.370 --> 31:15.339
She told you the truth about...
her and your father?

31:15.370 --> 31:18.066
CARLY:
At first, I thought
it was a joke.

31:18.110 --> 31:19.463
Like, Russian spies?

31:19.510 --> 31:22.377
We-we live in Westchester.
We have a minivan.

31:25.350 --> 31:27.648
But it wasn't a joke.

31:27.680 --> 31:31.047
Every-Everything my parents
had told me was a lie.

31:31.090 --> 31:34.218
Odd that your father
wasn't there, as well, no?

31:34.260 --> 31:36.285
She told me that we had to
keep it between the two of us.

31:36.320 --> 31:39.221
That he wouldn't understand,
and so,

31:39.260 --> 31:41.353
it was really important
for all of us

31:41.400 --> 31:43.994
for me to do
exactly what she told me to do.

31:44.030 --> 31:47.090
Did she threaten you?

31:47.130 --> 31:49.997
She told me there were people
out there who could hurt us.

31:50.040 --> 31:52.668
And I figured that they were
the people she was working for.

31:52.710 --> 31:54.507
GREGSON:
Why was your mom

31:54.540 --> 31:56.405
so intent on you going
to Georgetown?

31:56.440 --> 31:59.375
She said they have
the better government program.

31:59.410 --> 32:01.071
She said that a degree

32:01.120 --> 32:03.076
from there would
really mean something.

32:03.120 --> 32:04.542
I guess, after college,

32:04.590 --> 32:06.319
I was supposed to get a job
in Washington, or...

32:06.350 --> 32:09.979
Where you could operate
as a second generation agent.

32:10.020 --> 32:11.328
US. national

32:11.360 --> 32:12.486
who could penetrate
the corridors

32:12.530 --> 32:14.157
of government power

32:14.200 --> 32:16.293
and gain access
to information she never could.

32:16.330 --> 32:19.163
She had my whole life
planned out.

32:19.200 --> 32:21.964
She wanted me to give up
everything I ever wanted

32:22.000 --> 32:24.309
for a country I'd never
even seen, so I said, "No."

32:24.340 --> 32:26.467
I said no to Georgetown,
no to spying.

32:26.510 --> 32:29.274
I was going to Michigan,
I was going to play soccer.

32:29.310 --> 32:33.474
(crying):
Ijust... I...

32:33.510 --> 32:37.344
I'd fought back from too much
not to follow my dream.

32:37.380 --> 32:39.143
I-I told her

32:39.190 --> 32:41.112
that I'd go to the police
if she tried to stop me.

32:41.160 --> 32:42.309
I told her that-that

32:42.360 --> 32:45.329
I'd tell them
about her.

32:45.360 --> 32:50.753
But then, as I was leaving...

32:50.800 --> 32:54.361
she grabbed me, and...

32:54.400 --> 32:56.129
I-I don't_ know.
I was just...

32:56.170 --> 32:58.309
I was so freaked out that...

32:58.340 --> 33:00.501
I-I guess I just...
I guess I just

33:00.540 --> 33:02.428
shoved her.

33:02.480 --> 33:05.040
I called her name
a couple of times,

33:05.080 --> 33:07.344
but she just lay there. She...

33:07.380 --> 33:10.042
That's-that's when
Mr. Silver came in.

33:10.080 --> 33:12.048
Geoffrey Silver?

33:12.090 --> 33:14.285
He told me that he was
my mom's handler

33:14.320 --> 33:16.686
and that-th-that

33:16.720 --> 33:18.256
I was in a lot of trouble.

33:18.290 --> 33:19.450
He told me that...

33:19.490 --> 33:21.458
if I didn't go right away

33:21.500 --> 33:24.469
I was gonna go to jail and I was
never gonna see my dad again.

33:24.500 --> 33:28.539
1-1 was... I
was so afraid, I...

33:28.570 --> 33:31.539
My dad was all I had left,
and Ijust...

33:31.570 --> 33:35.336
I didn't know what to do,
so I went home and...

33:35.380 --> 33:38.372
I didn't say anything.

33:39.450 --> 33:41.577
Whatever-whatever else

33:41.620 --> 33:43.349
you think my dad did,

33:43.380 --> 33:44.779
he didn't kill my mom.

33:47.120 --> 33:49.111
I did.

33:51.330 --> 33:54.094
SILVER:
I'm very sorry.

33:54.130 --> 33:58.089
But I can neither c_onfirm
nor deny anything

33:58.130 --> 33:59.563
Carly Purcell may have told you.

33:59.600 --> 34:01.158
GREGSON:
'Cause you don't

34:01.200 --> 34:02.667
want to be charged as
an accessory to murder?

34:02.700 --> 34:05.168
And _because I don't
recognize your authority.

34:05.210 --> 34:08.407
Finished playing the part
of the American citizen, I see.

34:08.440 --> 34:12.103
You know you're going
to jail either way, right?

34:12.150 --> 34:16.575
Oliver Purcell's given the FBI
enough to put you away

34:16.620 --> 34:19.282
for the rest _
of your natural life.

34:19.320 --> 34:21.584
Did I say something
funny to you?

34:26.590 --> 34:29.525
I'd be very surprised
ifI spent more than a week

34:29.560 --> 34:30.629
in one of your jails.

34:32.530 --> 34:34.737
People in my alleged
line of work

34:34.770 --> 34:36.499
don't tend to be locked up.

34:36.540 --> 34:38.531
We tend to be traded.

34:41.510 --> 34:43.535
The US. government
is probably

34:43.580 --> 34:45.673
perusing a catalogue
of political prisoners

34:45.710 --> 34:47.507
they'd like
released from Russia,

34:47.550 --> 34:49.541
as we speak.

34:50.580 --> 34:52.411
GREGSON:
Well, then.

34:52.450 --> 34:55.715
I guess we'll just
let the Feds do

34:55.760 --> 34:58.456
whatever it is the Feds do.

34:58.490 --> 35:00.549
Come on.

35:04.870 --> 35:06.861
You ruined
that girl's life.

35:15.580 --> 35:18.208
HOLMES:
I must say, Watson,
I'm quite flattered.

35:18.250 --> 35:21.219
It's a lovely homage
to my methodology.

35:21.250 --> 35:24.139
But why apply it to a case
that's already solved?

35:24.190 --> 35:25.885
That door was closed.

35:25.920 --> 35:27.342
Was it?

35:27.390 --> 35:29.358
Look, I just...
(sighs)

35:29.390 --> 35:31.358
Carly Purcell didn't deserve
what's happened to her.

35:31.390 --> 35:33.620
I just thought if I looked at
the evidence one more time...

35:33.660 --> 35:34.797
I don't know.

35:34.830 --> 35:36.855
You could what?
Rewrite history?

35:36.900 --> 35:38.527
She already
confessed.

35:38.570 --> 35:40.367
What is that?

35:40.400 --> 35:42.436
Spaghetti in a mug?

35:42.470 --> 35:47.362
I take it that, uh, there's
still no clean bowls or plates?

35:47.410 --> 35:49.207
(sighs)

35:50.680 --> 35:52.648
How do you deal with...

35:52.680 --> 35:55.569
cases not working out
the way you want them to?

35:55.620 --> 35:57.872
The only promise a puzzle
makes is an answer.

35:57.920 --> 36:00.388
Liking the answer
doesn't factor in.

36:00.420 --> 36:02.251
In our line of work it mustn't.

36:03.290 --> 36:04.757
You're right.

36:04.790 --> 36:06.758
What is that?

36:06.790 --> 36:09.588
Oh, uh, Teri Purcell's
autopsy report

36:09.630 --> 36:11.598
just showed up
on our front doorstep.

36:11.630 --> 36:14.963
Oh, I actually requested
that from Gregson's office.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.195
(sighs)

36:23.510 --> 36:25.478
There's a break

36:25.510 --> 36:27.842
in the fourth metacarpal.

36:27.880 --> 36:30.348
That is a... boxer's fracture.

36:30.380 --> 36:33.440
Resulting from a clenched fist
striking something or...

36:33.490 --> 36:34.650
someone.

36:34.690 --> 36:36.783
WATSON:
You don't think that...

36:36.820 --> 36:39.459
that Teri fought back
against Carly, do you?

36:39.490 --> 36:41.924
She just willingly confessed
to matricide this afternoon.

36:41.960 --> 36:45.726
I doubt she would leave out the
part where her mum fought back.

36:47.670 --> 36:50.537
The pen.

36:50.570 --> 36:52.731
Yeah.

36:57.380 --> 36:59.644
HOLMES:
Mr. Silver.

36:59.680 --> 37:03.377
Such a pleasure
to see you again.

37:03.420 --> 37:05.308
You're angry.

37:05.350 --> 37:06.544
You know _
the government's working

37:06.590 --> 37:08.387
on one of those deals
you mentioned,

37:08.420 --> 37:10.650
looking to trade you back
to where you came from.

37:10.690 --> 37:14.751
I'm afraid I'm about to bollocks
that all up for you now.

37:14.800 --> 37:18.566
That would be...
impresswe.

37:18.600 --> 37:19.862
GREGSON:
For the record, Mr. Silver,

37:19.900 --> 37:21.731
you never saw Teri,

37:21.770 --> 37:24.500
you never visited her at the
hotel the night of her murder?

37:24.540 --> 37:28.636
As I explained to your men
the day I met them,

37:32.780 --> 37:35.669
Nyet, comrade. Big lie.

37:35.720 --> 37:38.484
You saw her the
day she died.

37:38.520 --> 37:40.647
You came running into her
office when you realized

37:40.690 --> 37:43.614
her meeting with her
daughter had gone south.

37:43.660 --> 37:46.481
You then pressured Carly into
joining the family business,

37:46.530 --> 37:47.883
and you asked her to leave

37:47.930 --> 37:50.319
so you could dispose
of her mother's body.

37:50.360 --> 37:51.964
The only problem was,

37:52.000 --> 37:54.639
she wasn't dead yet.

37:54.670 --> 37:57.639
You had a big decision to make.

37:57.670 --> 37:59.638
You'd just used
her apparent murder

37:59.670 --> 38:02.901
to leverage her daughter
into becoming a spy.

38:02.940 --> 38:06.569
Carly was quite
an asset for you.

38:06.610 --> 38:08.578
A real US citizen.

38:08.620 --> 38:11.646
Not much use in the short term,
but in the long term--

38:11.690 --> 38:13.442
sky's the limit.

38:13.490 --> 38:15.048
I mean, she-she could be

38:15.090 --> 38:17.684
President Purcell
when all was said and done.

38:17.720 --> 38:22.521
Unfortunately, the same could
not be said for poor Teri.

38:22.560 --> 38:24.562
So you decided to...

38:24.600 --> 38:26.022
retire her.

38:26.070 --> 38:27.662
WATSON: Teri fought
back, though.

38:27.700 --> 38:29.736
She hit you hard enough
to break her hand.

38:29.770 --> 38:31.635
When that didn't work,
she relieved you of that.

38:33.140 --> 38:35.734
Used it to
stab at you.

38:35.780 --> 38:38.647
She only managed
to break it open in her hand.

38:38.680 --> 38:40.375
Nonsense.

38:40.410 --> 38:41.616
HOLMES:
Yeah.

38:41.650 --> 38:43.572
I can understand
why it looks that way, yeah.

38:43.620 --> 38:45.838
After all, there was no ink
found at the crime scene.

38:45.890 --> 38:49.553
None on Teri, none on any of
the other linens in the washer.

38:49.590 --> 38:52.718
But then I thought, just because
you can't see a stain

38:52.760 --> 38:54.955
doesn't mean it isn't there.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.458
Are you familiar with
the concept of invisible ink?

38:58.500 --> 39:01.389
(laughing):
Invisible ink?

39:01.440 --> 39:03.738
(laughs)
Yeah. Yeah, trust me.

39:03.770 --> 39:06.864
I know precisely
how ridiculous it sounds.

39:06.910 --> 39:09.708
Might as well have a phone
in your shoe.

39:09.740 --> 39:11.742
And yet, spies like you

39:11.780 --> 39:13.998
have been using
it for centuries.

39:14.050 --> 39:16.848
This pen, for example,
had traces of a type known

39:16.880 --> 39:18.780
as permanent fluorescing ink,

39:18.820 --> 39:20.685
imperceptible to
the human eye,

39:20.720 --> 39:22.381
and revealed only under

39:22.420 --> 39:23.853
an ultraviolet light.

39:23.890 --> 39:26.552
Now, I went to the morgue
this morning,

39:26.590 --> 39:30.424
and I shone Teri's hand
under a UV lamp.

39:32.170 --> 39:35.833
Even after the wash, her palm
was covered in the stuff.

39:35.870 --> 39:37.792
And when she struggled with you,

39:37.840 --> 39:40.764
she got it all
over your clothes.

39:40.810 --> 39:44.007
Captain, if you will?

39:44.040 --> 39:45.701
Exhibit B.

39:47.550 --> 39:49.768
Your Zegna shirt,

39:49.820 --> 39:51.048
raided from your closet

39:51.080 --> 39:53.742
earlier today,
under a warrant.

39:53.790 --> 39:56.987
When I shine a UV lamp on it,

39:57.020 --> 40:00.888
the story it reveals
is as clear as it is compelling.

40:03.760 --> 40:07.594
And that's Teri's handprint
on your shirt.

40:07.630 --> 40:09.689
You didn't just

40:09.740 --> 40:11.935
see her the other night,

40:11.970 --> 40:13.767
you killed her.

40:15.140 --> 40:17.108
You were right
the other day.

40:17.140 --> 40:19.574
The US.

40:19.610 --> 40:22.818
would trade a spy
under the right circumstances.

40:22.850 --> 40:26.013
These, however,
are not those circumstances.

40:26.050 --> 40:28.712
A matter of fact,

40:28.760 --> 40:32.548
I see your stay
in the States being extended.

40:32.590 --> 40:36.924
Somewhere along the lines
of 20 to life?

40:39.800 --> 40:42.098
What's going to happen
with my dad?

40:42.140 --> 40:43.732
He's cooperating

40:43.770 --> 40:46.603
with the FBI right now,
in exchange for immunity.

40:46.640 --> 40:48.198
You'll both be placed
in Witness Protection

40:48.240 --> 40:49.798
and get a new start.

40:52.510 --> 40:54.569
(sniffling):
I, uh...

40:54.620 --> 40:58.249
I know my mom was asking me
to do something really terrible,

40:58.280 --> 41:01.784
but I loved her, and I just,

41:01.820 --> 41:05.881
I still feel really,
really responsible.

41:05.930 --> 41:08.023
It's going to hurt for a while.

41:08.060 --> 41:10.927
You need to let it.

41:10.960 --> 41:13.929
And if any old
demons come back...

41:13.970 --> 41:15.699
I'll-I'II-I'II call you.

41:15.740 --> 41:18.061
Or I'll...
I'll talk to my dad.

41:18.100 --> 41:20.204
I promise.

41:20.240 --> 41:21.878
BELL:
Hey.

41:21.910 --> 41:23.571
Listen, if you two
are through,

41:23.610 --> 41:25.248
I can take Miss Purcell
to see her dad now.

41:25.280 --> 41:27.771
Great.

41:27.810 --> 41:29.812
Thank you.

41:36.260 --> 41:38.888
Tough times don't last.

41:38.930 --> 41:41.819
Tough people do.

41:54.010 --> 41:55.875
How's Miss Purcell?

41:55.910 --> 41:57.935
As well as can be expected.

41:57.980 --> 42:00.073
Quite proud of you,
Watson--

42:00.110 --> 42:01.646
your doggedness.

42:01.680 --> 42:02.977
I give you as much credit

42:03.020 --> 42:05.318
for solving this case
as I do myself.

42:05.350 --> 42:08.080
Thanks.

42:08.120 --> 42:10.816
Hm. No wonder you're so keen
to stay on as my associate.

42:10.860 --> 42:11.986
Sherlock...

42:12.030 --> 42:13.622
As I proposed the other day,

42:13.660 --> 42:15.855
we can tell my father
I've hit a bit of a rough patch.

42:15.900 --> 42:16.650
He'll keep the checks coming.

42:16.700 --> 42:18.156
You can continue
to hone your skill.

42:18.200 --> 42:20.168
I took another
job this morning.

42:22.040 --> 42:24.292
I work with other therapists,

42:24.340 --> 42:25.830
and I was referred
to another client,

42:25.870 --> 42:27.701
so I'll be starting
with him next week,

42:27.740 --> 42:29.037
after you and I wrap up.

42:29.080 --> 42:30.900
I see.

42:32.250 --> 42:36.016
I'm usually quite good
with deductions.

42:36.050 --> 42:37.847
Are you okay?

42:37.880 --> 42:39.814
My dear Watson,
whenever am I not?
