00:14.863 --> 00:16.230
Oh, baby, come on!

00:16.231 --> 00:17.798
Don't tease me like this.

00:28.377 --> 00:31.212
Um! The old
feathered fan dance.

00:31.213 --> 00:33.214
A little clichÃ© to me,
but it's certainly

00:33.215 --> 00:35.983
doing the trick for...
some people.

00:40.055 --> 00:41.755
Those feathers
look awfully heavy.

00:41.757 --> 00:43.324
Why don't you put them down
for a bit?

00:56.838 --> 00:58.672
That's for the price
of admission!

01:02.010 --> 01:03.577
Hold these for me, would you?

01:03.578 --> 01:05.012
Why aren't you out there?
You're in the finale.

01:05.013 --> 01:06.614
Not anymore, I ain't.

01:09.684 --> 01:12.019
You get back out on that stage
or you're out of here.

01:12.020 --> 01:14.021
I'm done sharing the stage
with the opening acts.

01:14.022 --> 01:15.189
I'm a leading lady.

01:15.190 --> 01:18.692
Cici Storm,
The Baroness of Burlesque!

01:18.693 --> 01:21.862
You know, they told me
when I hired you.

01:21.863 --> 01:23.531
They said your ego
was even bigger than your...

01:23.532 --> 01:24.865
Careful, Elmer.

01:24.866 --> 01:26.867
This isn't
summer stock, honey.

01:26.868 --> 01:28.536
You're paid to close the show.

01:28.537 --> 01:30.538
I'm actually really glad
you brought that up

01:30.539 --> 01:32.373
because I've been wanting
to talk to you about my pay.

01:32.374 --> 01:34.041
It ain't reflective
of my status.

01:34.042 --> 01:35.709
Don't you be laughing, Elmer.

01:35.710 --> 01:37.211
You need to take me seriously.

01:37.212 --> 01:39.713
Last place I worked paid twice
what you're giving me,

01:39.714 --> 01:41.715
and I got a private
dressing room to boot.

01:41.716 --> 01:44.385
I mean no disrespect
by this, Elmer,

01:44.386 --> 01:46.220
but what kind
of amateur operation

01:46.221 --> 01:48.322
are you running here? Elmer?

01:50.225 --> 01:51.492
Elmer?

01:52.394 --> 01:54.061
Walking out on me?

01:54.062 --> 01:55.496
I swear to...

02:03.004 --> 02:04.772
Thank you for coming,
Officer Shaw.

02:04.773 --> 02:06.507
Oh, it was no trouble at all.

02:06.508 --> 02:08.842
I wouldn't normally call
a morality officer

02:08.844 --> 02:12.012
into such a gruesome situation,
but... circumstances called

02:12.013 --> 02:14.515
- for a more delicate approach.
- Sir?

02:14.516 --> 02:18.118
I wander if you could assist
Miss Storm here

02:18.119 --> 02:20.454
changing into something

02:20.455 --> 02:21.789
a little less bloody.

02:21.790 --> 02:23.357
Of course.

02:23.358 --> 02:24.458
Thank you.

02:28.530 --> 02:30.531
Miss Storm,
I'm Officer Shaw.

02:30.532 --> 02:32.700
I'm going to help you
get cleaned up.

02:32.701 --> 02:34.201
I don't understand.

02:34.202 --> 02:35.703
He was sitting
right there...

02:35.704 --> 02:37.371
I was just trying
to help him.

02:37.372 --> 02:39.873
I believe you're in shock,
which is perfectly normal.

02:39.875 --> 02:42.643
If there's anything you need,
you can talk to me.

02:43.712 --> 02:44.878
I appreciate it.

02:45.881 --> 02:47.114
You're the first person here
to talk to me

02:47.115 --> 02:49.483
- like a human being.
- I found something, sir!

02:50.886 --> 02:52.553
In the last pocket
of this robe.

02:52.554 --> 02:54.355
Good work, Donahue.

02:54.356 --> 02:55.489
Wait...

02:55.490 --> 02:57.825
- Is this your robe?
- This wasn't me.

02:57.826 --> 02:59.159
I've never seen that knife
before in my life.

02:59.160 --> 03:00.995
- Honest to God!
- Take her down to the station.

03:00.996 --> 03:02.830
- Put this in evidence.
- Officer Shaw!

03:02.831 --> 03:04.398
- You've got believe me.
- Let's go.

03:06.167 --> 03:07.434
Thank you, Officer Shaw.

03:33.194 --> 03:35.029
The strange thing
is that everyone

03:35.030 --> 03:36.697
was alerted to the murder
because Cici,

03:36.698 --> 03:39.366
as I understand it,
let out a deafening scream.

03:39.367 --> 03:41.035
It's interesting.

03:41.036 --> 03:42.703
If she were
the actual murderer,

03:42.704 --> 03:43.871
wouldn't that be
rather careless?

03:43.872 --> 03:45.706
Or cunning.
If she was trying to create

03:45.707 --> 03:47.875
- the illusion of innocence.
- But if she's so cunning,

03:47.876 --> 03:49.710
why put the murder weapon
in her own robe?

03:49.711 --> 03:51.712
Maybe she heard someone
and panicked?

03:51.713 --> 03:53.213
I saw the look
in her eyes, Frankie.

03:53.214 --> 03:55.049
And call it a gut feeling,

03:55.050 --> 03:56.650
but I just don't think
she did this.

03:57.652 --> 03:58.819
And there is
something else.

03:58.820 --> 04:00.320
- What?
- Well... As I was

04:00.322 --> 04:01.655
leaving the scene,
I happened to glance back

04:01.656 --> 04:03.490
just for a moment and...

04:03.491 --> 04:05.159
Well, I might be jumping
to conclusions, but...

04:05.160 --> 04:06.527
Don't keep us in suspense.

04:07.529 --> 04:08.829
Well, I may have seen
Detective Greyson

04:08.830 --> 04:10.464
do something odd
at the crime scene.

04:10.465 --> 04:12.399
What exactly did you see?

04:12.400 --> 04:14.001
Well, I saw him
pick up a white cloth

04:14.002 --> 04:15.836
near Elmer's body
and instead of putting it

04:15.837 --> 04:17.838
into the evidence box
as is protocol,

04:17.839 --> 04:19.339
he slipped it in his pocket.

04:19.341 --> 04:21.608
I may not be
Greyson's biggest fan

04:21.610 --> 04:23.944
but tampering with evidence
from a murder scene?

04:23.945 --> 04:25.679
I thought he was
a straight arrow.

04:25.680 --> 04:27.181
- So did I.
- I found it hard

04:27.182 --> 04:29.083
to believe myself,
but I know what I saw.

04:29.084 --> 04:31.351
See if you can take
another look at that cloth.

04:31.353 --> 04:32.686
Yeah. That I can do.

04:32.687 --> 04:34.021
But if Greyson's
covering something up...

04:34.022 --> 04:35.489
An innocent woman will hang.

04:35.490 --> 04:36.757
Let me check in with Flo

04:36.758 --> 04:38.525
and see if the autopsy
revealed anything suspicious.

04:38.526 --> 04:40.260
If I'm going to prove
that she's innocent,

04:40.261 --> 04:42.096
I need to know that Cici
is in fact innocent.

04:42.097 --> 04:43.597
Any idea
where they're keeping her?

04:43.598 --> 04:45.365
Down at the station
in a holding cell

04:45.367 --> 04:46.500
until she stands trial.

04:46.501 --> 04:48.435
How do we get in there?

04:51.873 --> 04:52.940
I have an idea.

04:52.941 --> 04:54.241
Thanks.

04:54.242 --> 04:56.510
I think some time
to reflect on the consequences

04:56.511 --> 04:58.579
of your liquor habit
will serve you well.

04:58.580 --> 05:01.915
Sleep it off. I'll come back
when you've sobered up.

05:15.497 --> 05:16.930
What are you in for?

05:20.001 --> 05:22.002
Suit yourself.

05:22.003 --> 05:23.937
I thought you could
use a friend in here.

05:26.508 --> 05:27.741
Murder.

05:30.011 --> 05:31.779
Impressive.

05:33.181 --> 05:35.182
Hey! Between us gals...

05:35.183 --> 05:37.351
- did you do it?
- Of course I didn't do it!

05:37.352 --> 05:40.053
I couldn't hurt a fly,
never mind slash a man's throat.

05:40.055 --> 05:41.522
Isn't that
what everyone says?

05:41.523 --> 05:42.523
Maybe.

05:42.524 --> 05:44.224
But it happens to be true.

05:44.225 --> 05:45.826
Tricky part is proving it.

05:45.827 --> 05:48.128
Only proof I got
is I didn't do it.

05:49.531 --> 05:50.864
What's the point?

05:50.865 --> 05:52.699
Everyone's mind
is already made up.

05:52.701 --> 05:53.867
And after all,

05:53.868 --> 05:55.508
who's gonna believe
some burlesque dancer?

06:00.642 --> 06:01.909
Frankie Drake.

06:03.144 --> 06:04.244
Private investigator.

06:10.652 --> 06:11.752
Muriel!

06:11.753 --> 06:14.321
- What a lovely surprise.
- Mary!

06:14.322 --> 06:15.989
It's been so long,
I'd forgotten you work here.

06:15.990 --> 06:17.658
Oh! I got my own desk.

06:17.659 --> 06:19.693
Oh! Must be nice.

06:19.694 --> 06:20.994
That's more
than they've given me

06:20.995 --> 06:22.162
at the River Street Station.

06:22.163 --> 06:23.997
They just don't
understand the value

06:23.998 --> 06:25.666
we morality officers add.

06:25.667 --> 06:27.668
No. I couldn't agree more.

06:27.669 --> 06:28.735
What brings you here?

06:28.737 --> 06:30.838
I heard chatter
about a murderess.

06:30.839 --> 06:33.273
Is it terribly tactless to admit
I wanted to have a gander?

06:34.676 --> 06:36.343
Muriel!

06:36.344 --> 06:38.078
I'm surprised at you.

06:38.079 --> 06:40.080
To be honest,
I'm quite shocked.

06:40.081 --> 06:41.815
She's not a monkey in a cage.

06:41.816 --> 06:43.851
Oh, my goodness!
You're absolutely right, Mary.

06:43.852 --> 06:46.420
What was I thinking?
I'm so embarrassed.

06:46.421 --> 06:48.522
And if you ask me,
she didn't do it.

06:48.523 --> 06:52.125
- Really, why?
- Call it a woman's intuition.

06:52.127 --> 06:54.294
Not that anyone around here
would care about that.

06:55.964 --> 06:56.964
I should go.

06:56.965 --> 06:58.298
Oh! Well...

06:58.299 --> 07:00.734
- Let's find time for a tea soon?
- Oh! I'd like that.

07:02.137 --> 07:04.504
The dressing room door
was open when we walked in.

07:04.506 --> 07:06.807
Normally,
Elmer keeps it shut.

07:07.809 --> 07:09.810
And that was
out of the ordinary?

07:09.811 --> 07:10.944
I suppose.

07:12.013 --> 07:14.481
I immediately went
behind the screen to change.

07:14.482 --> 07:16.483
I wasn't gonna to give him
a free show,

07:16.484 --> 07:17.651
You know what I mean.

07:17.652 --> 07:18.819
No kidding.

07:18.820 --> 07:19.987
Then what happened?

07:19.988 --> 07:21.889
I was giving him a earful

07:21.890 --> 07:23.156
and then I heard
the door close.

07:24.159 --> 07:25.659
I popped my head out
from behind the screen

07:25.660 --> 07:27.761
and that's when I saw him.

07:27.762 --> 07:29.730
- Well, you know.
- Dead.

07:29.731 --> 07:31.131
As a doornail.

07:31.132 --> 07:33.600
Do you have any idea
who had it in for Elmer?

07:34.502 --> 07:35.836
I didn't know him
all that well.

07:35.837 --> 07:37.571
Apart from knowing
he was cheap.

07:37.572 --> 07:39.907
You want real dirt?

07:39.908 --> 07:41.275
Talk to Vera Jean.

07:41.276 --> 07:43.677
Is she another dancer?

07:43.678 --> 07:45.012
Worked The Krazy Kitten
so long

07:45.013 --> 07:46.613
she practically
runs the joint.

07:46.614 --> 07:48.615
That's a good place to start.

07:48.616 --> 07:50.117
Miss Drake...

07:51.186 --> 07:53.220
Do you ever solve cases
the coppers can't?

07:54.355 --> 07:56.023
It's my speciality.

07:58.793 --> 08:00.994
Officer Shaw!

08:00.995 --> 08:02.396
I'm sober!

08:05.133 --> 08:07.601
Yep, the slash across
Elmer Dunning's throat

08:07.602 --> 08:09.803
- definitely killed him.
- No surprises there.

08:09.804 --> 08:11.972
There was
one surprising thing.

08:11.973 --> 08:13.807
- What's that?
- On his clothes.

08:13.808 --> 08:14.975
A strange smell.

08:14.976 --> 08:16.643
A sweet pungent odour,

08:16.644 --> 08:18.812
typically associated
with metabolic disorders.

08:18.813 --> 08:21.181
- So I did a little investigating.
- And?

08:21.182 --> 08:23.717
Along the way, I did notice
some mucosal irritation.

08:23.718 --> 08:26.820
- Which means...?
- Diethyl ether,

08:26.821 --> 08:28.221
a common anaesthetic agent.

08:28.223 --> 08:30.324
The sweet pungent odor.

08:30.325 --> 08:31.992
Our victim was etherized.

08:31.993 --> 08:35.495
So our killer approaches Elmer
from behind and drugs him.

08:35.496 --> 08:36.830
And when he's silend
and subdued,

08:36.831 --> 08:38.332
the killer slashes his throat.

08:38.332 --> 08:40.333
And saunters out
without anyone noticing.

08:40.335 --> 08:42.336
Well-planned murder...
As murders go.

09:13.201 --> 09:14.968
Officer Shaw.

09:14.969 --> 09:16.136
Can I help you?

09:16.137 --> 09:18.071
Uh... Yes, sir. It's...

09:20.975 --> 09:23.477
Constable Donahue
asked me to verify

09:23.478 --> 09:25.145
that you had logged
all of the evidence

09:25.146 --> 09:26.780
in the burlesque case.

09:27.815 --> 09:29.082
Is that so?

09:29.083 --> 09:31.651
So there's nothing
left to enter into evidence?

09:31.653 --> 09:33.253
Nothing at all?

09:34.489 --> 09:36.490
Tell Constable Donahue
that if he has a problem

09:36.491 --> 09:38.992
with my evidence logging, he can
come speak with me directly.

09:39.994 --> 09:42.262
Yes. I'll pass
that message along, sir.

09:43.197 --> 09:44.531
You're excused.

09:45.500 --> 09:46.767
Oh! Excuse me!

10:05.186 --> 10:06.353
Vera Jean?

10:06.354 --> 10:07.888
Maybe.

10:07.889 --> 10:09.189
Cici says you know

10:09.190 --> 10:11.024
everything there is to know
about this place.

10:11.025 --> 10:12.292
Oh yeah? And who're you?

10:12.293 --> 10:13.693
Frankie Drake.

10:13.695 --> 10:15.662
I'm the one trying to get her
out of prison, Miss Jean.

10:15.663 --> 10:17.998
In that case,
call me Vera.

10:17.999 --> 10:19.466
Vera it is.

10:20.368 --> 10:21.408
How well do you know Cici?

10:22.370 --> 10:24.037
Enough to know that
the only thing she's guilty of

10:24.038 --> 10:25.872
is being in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

10:25.873 --> 10:28.375
- Cici's no angel.
- Who is?

10:28.376 --> 10:30.377
But she ain't no murderess.
I would stake my life on that.

10:30.378 --> 10:32.879
You can clear this up, right?
And get her out of jail?

10:32.880 --> 10:34.681
I'm gonna do everything I can.

10:34.682 --> 10:36.116
Thanks.

10:36.117 --> 10:37.851
You really care about her,
don't you?

10:38.920 --> 10:40.720
I just don't like to see
an innocent gal

10:40.722 --> 10:43.323
- locked in a cell.
- Neither do I.

10:44.225 --> 10:45.725
What can you tell me
about Elmer?

10:45.727 --> 10:48.395
He was a cad for sure,
but a damn good businessman.

10:48.396 --> 10:49.896
Knew how to run
a classy joint

10:49.897 --> 10:51.898
and still give the audience
what they were looking for.

10:51.899 --> 10:53.400
- What do you mean?
- He and his lawyers

10:53.401 --> 10:55.068
were constantly finding tricks
to skirt the law.

10:55.069 --> 10:57.370
Cops say the dancers
can't perform topless...

10:57.372 --> 10:59.873
So, he invests in these.

11:01.009 --> 11:03.009
- Very innovative.
- Don't give him all the credit.

11:03.011 --> 11:04.511
It was my idea
to add the tassels.

11:04.512 --> 11:07.547
Opens up a whole new world
of choreography.

11:07.548 --> 11:09.116
So I see.

11:10.518 --> 11:12.185
Who was in the audience
last night?

11:12.186 --> 11:15.856
The only person of note
was Lou Hastings.

11:17.025 --> 11:19.392
Isn't he one
of Bessie Starkman's boys?

11:19.394 --> 11:21.027
He's Nelson Kovac's man.

11:21.029 --> 11:23.363
- Heard of him?
- Notorious bootlegger

11:23.364 --> 11:24.698
who is now in prison.

11:24.699 --> 11:25.999
So what does Lou do for him?

11:26.000 --> 11:28.368
Everything.
He's Kovac's right-hand man.

11:28.369 --> 11:30.904
But I would've thought
with Kovac in prison,

11:30.905 --> 11:33.306
the whole bootlegging operation
would be put on ice.

11:33.307 --> 11:35.876
You'd think, but Hastings
has fought tooth and nail

11:35.877 --> 11:37.244
to keep operations going.

11:42.250 --> 11:44.384
So Kovac's muscle
was in the audience that night.

11:44.385 --> 11:46.505
You think Kovac has something
against Elmer Dunning?

11:47.555 --> 11:50.056
Wendy, have you ever had
any dealings with Nelson Kovac?

11:50.058 --> 11:52.659
I try to steer clear of him.

11:53.728 --> 11:55.228
But I might know someone
that you can talk to.

11:55.229 --> 11:56.863
Let me see what I can do.

11:56.864 --> 11:57.998
Okay.

11:57.999 --> 12:00.167
- Any news from Flo?
- There was one thing.

12:00.168 --> 12:03.003
Flo found evidence of ether
in Elmer's system.

12:03.004 --> 12:04.104
Ether?

12:05.506 --> 12:08.008
Maybe that's what
that white cloth was for.

12:08.009 --> 12:09.910
The one that Greyson
took from the scene.

12:09.911 --> 12:12.345
There is something
going on with him.

12:12.346 --> 12:13.547
I just know he's lying.

12:13.548 --> 12:14.948
Question is why.

12:14.949 --> 12:17.050
I'm gonna head back
and poke around.

12:17.051 --> 12:19.853
Mary... We don't know
what Greyson's up to.

12:19.854 --> 12:21.521
So just... be careful.

12:24.965 --> 12:27.581
_

12:28.807 --> 12:31.011
_

12:31.466 --> 12:34.062
_

12:35.369 --> 12:37.470
He says he'd be delighted
to talk to you.

12:38.706 --> 12:40.874
We're looking into the murder
of Elmer Dunning.

12:40.875 --> 12:43.043
- So?
- So we think your boss

12:43.044 --> 12:44.411
sent Lou Hastings to kill him.

12:44.412 --> 12:47.314
- Do you know anything about that?
- No.

12:47.315 --> 12:50.050
Did Elmer buy much booze
from Kovac?

12:50.051 --> 12:51.551
The Krazy Kitten's more...

12:51.552 --> 12:53.220
a bring your own booze
kind of club.

12:53.221 --> 12:54.988
So they weren't
doing business together?

12:57.801 --> 12:58.974
_

13:01.379 --> 13:05.591
_

13:08.669 --> 13:11.972
Seems Elmer was sleeping
with Kovac's missus.

13:13.674 --> 13:15.508
Well, that's motive.

13:25.186 --> 13:26.353
Ripley!

13:49.877 --> 13:51.478
Jack Ross...

13:55.049 --> 13:56.650
Officer Shaw!

13:56.651 --> 13:58.318
Oh! Detective Greyson!

13:58.319 --> 14:00.987
I was just dropping off
this cup of tea

14:00.988 --> 14:02.489
when I felt a sneeze coming on...

14:02.490 --> 14:03.790
Put that back
where you found it

14:03.791 --> 14:05.125
and pack up your things.

14:05.126 --> 14:07.560
Sorry, pack up my things, sir?

14:07.562 --> 14:09.329
You've done your last bit
of snooping around here.

14:09.330 --> 14:10.930
Stand aside. You're fired.

14:16.752 --> 14:19.420
So I have good news
and bad news.

14:19.421 --> 14:20.755
OK.

14:20.756 --> 14:22.990
The bad news is
that Greyson has fired me

14:22.992 --> 14:25.093
and my life-long goal

14:25.094 --> 14:26.427
of becoming a real
police officer

14:26.428 --> 14:28.429
is even further from my grasp
than ever before.

14:28.430 --> 14:30.832
- What?
- Mary, I'm so sorry.

14:32.267 --> 14:33.367
What's the good news?

14:33.369 --> 14:35.436
Well, the good news
is that I am now

14:35.437 --> 14:36.938
available to apply for

14:36.939 --> 14:39.440
and hopefully be accepted

14:39.441 --> 14:42.677
as the newest full-time member
of Drake Private Detectives.

14:42.678 --> 14:43.811
Now, as you know,

14:43.812 --> 14:45.279
I've been working
as a morality officer

14:45.280 --> 14:46.481
for the past two years.

14:46.482 --> 14:48.282
But what you may not
know is, prior to that,

14:48.283 --> 14:49.617
I was a fully decorated
Girl Guide.

14:49.618 --> 14:51.219
- Mary...
- I'm hard-working,

14:51.220 --> 14:53.387
I am organised
and in my spare time, I...

14:53.389 --> 14:55.056
Of course
you can join the team!

14:55.057 --> 14:56.724
Not that you weren't
already part of it...

14:56.725 --> 14:58.126
Welcome to the payroll!

14:58.127 --> 15:01.229
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

15:01.230 --> 15:02.497
You won't regret this.

15:02.498 --> 15:05.299
For one thing, I've got
information on Greyson.

15:05.300 --> 15:06.901
So the reason
he fired me

15:06.902 --> 15:08.402
is that he caught me
snooping around his desk.

15:08.404 --> 15:10.071
But I can confirm
that the white cloth

15:10.072 --> 15:12.140
is in fact
an embroidered handkerchief.

15:13.409 --> 15:14.842
Well, I went through
the guest list

15:14.843 --> 15:17.411
at The Krazy Kitten's
and all the regulars check out.

15:17.413 --> 15:20.414
And the bouncer confirmed no one
entered or exited the club

15:20.416 --> 15:22.950
around the time of the murder.
What about Wendy's contact?

15:22.951 --> 15:24.585
Well, it seems Elmer
was doing business

15:24.586 --> 15:26.587
- with Kovac's wife.
- What?

15:26.588 --> 15:27.622
They were
sleeping together.

15:27.623 --> 15:28.990
- Oh...
- So Kovac sent

15:28.991 --> 15:30.758
his muscle Lou Hastings
to kill him?

15:30.759 --> 15:33.928
Maybe. But why
would Greyson steal evidence?

15:33.929 --> 15:35.630
Well, ever since
Elmer's murder,

15:35.631 --> 15:36.931
Greyson's been
very interested

15:36.932 --> 15:38.266
in this one
particular case.

15:38.267 --> 15:39.934
- What is it?
- It had something to do

15:39.935 --> 15:41.269
with a Jack Ross.
That's all I saw

15:41.270 --> 15:42.470
before he caught me.

15:42.471 --> 15:44.272
What does that have to do
with Elmer's murder?

15:44.273 --> 15:46.307
- I'm not sure.
- We need to get that file.

15:46.308 --> 15:48.442
Well... It's easier said
than done now.

15:48.444 --> 15:50.478
Is there any way
you could get back inside?

15:51.380 --> 15:52.813
Well, there might be
one way...

15:53.949 --> 15:55.883
If you could ensure
it goes to a good home...

15:55.884 --> 15:58.319
Preferably one
with an electric iron.

16:02.257 --> 16:03.491
Muriel?

16:05.427 --> 16:07.728
Mary! What are you doing here?

16:07.729 --> 16:09.230
Just returning
my uniform.

16:09.231 --> 16:10.731
Do you work here?

16:10.732 --> 16:12.433
Yes. But when I learned
the circumstances

16:12.434 --> 16:13.734
under which
I was being transferred,

16:13.735 --> 16:16.070
- I felt awful.
- No. They're lucky to have you.

16:16.071 --> 16:18.406
- Do you mean it?
- Of course I do.

16:18.407 --> 16:20.441
The only thing
I ever wanted from this job

16:20.442 --> 16:21.742
was to make the world
a better place.

16:21.743 --> 16:23.411
I won't be
accomplishing that now...

16:23.412 --> 16:26.914
But if anyone has to replace me,
I'm very happy that it's you.

16:26.915 --> 16:28.416
That's such a relief, Mary.
Thank you.

16:28.417 --> 16:30.418
And if there's anything
I can do for you,

16:30.419 --> 16:32.253
anything at all,
you let me know, okay?

16:32.254 --> 16:33.454
I will. Thank you.

16:33.455 --> 16:35.456
Look out for Cici
for me, will you?

16:35.457 --> 16:38.926
Oh, I'll do what I can.
In the meantime...

16:38.927 --> 16:41.362
I'm off to measure hemlines.

16:56.879 --> 17:00.481
Jack Ross, Jack Ross,
Jack Ross...

17:05.721 --> 17:07.221
Frankie! Trudy!

17:07.222 --> 17:09.723
You're never gonna believe this!

17:09.724 --> 17:12.993
He's stolen
the entire Jack Ross file!

17:16.397 --> 17:17.832
Hello?

17:33.916 --> 17:35.249
If Lou killed Elmer,

17:35.250 --> 17:37.418
how did he make it backstage
unnoticed?

17:37.419 --> 17:38.686
Could you walk us through it?

17:39.621 --> 17:40.855
Well...

17:40.856 --> 17:43.424
There were dancers backstage
all night.

17:43.425 --> 17:45.092
The only time it was empty

17:45.093 --> 17:47.094
was toward the end
of Cici's act.

17:47.095 --> 17:48.596
That's when we all line up

17:48.597 --> 17:49.597
in the wings stage left

17:49.598 --> 17:51.299
to get ready
for the big finale.

17:52.367 --> 17:54.368
A burlesque chorus line
sort of thing.

17:54.369 --> 17:56.370
Elmer thought he was running
the Moulin Rouge.

17:56.371 --> 17:57.538
And where was Elmer?

17:57.539 --> 17:59.807
In his usual spot,
stage right.

18:01.043 --> 18:02.543
Did you remember
where Lou was sitting?

18:02.544 --> 18:04.378
You couldn't miss him.
Like I said,

18:04.379 --> 18:06.213
he was making
a spectacle of himself.

18:06.215 --> 18:08.883
He was at a table halfway back,
stage left.

18:08.884 --> 18:10.885
I had a clear view
from the curtain.

18:10.886 --> 18:12.219
The only way
to the dressing room

18:12.221 --> 18:13.501
from the audience
is stage right.

18:14.389 --> 18:15.890
If Lou did it, he would
have had to make his way

18:15.891 --> 18:18.225
across the entire length
of the club.

18:18.227 --> 18:19.894
Without a single person
noticing him.

18:19.895 --> 18:21.495
It didn't happen.
I guarantee it.

18:49.424 --> 18:52.293
How does Frankie do this?

18:58.367 --> 18:59.633
Oh!

19:12.547 --> 19:15.216
Clearly Greyson doesn't
entertain much.

19:15.217 --> 19:16.317
Oh!

19:25.560 --> 19:26.994
Handkerchief...

19:38.573 --> 19:41.242
Oh! Hello, Jack Ross.

19:45.247 --> 19:46.580
The lens cap!

20:41.943 --> 20:43.443
I found the Jack Ross file!

20:43.444 --> 20:45.545
I got photos of it
and everything.

20:45.546 --> 20:46.646
Great!

20:46.647 --> 20:48.214
So the uniform trick
got you into the station?

20:48.215 --> 20:51.284
It did. Where I found
absolutely nothing.

20:51.285 --> 20:53.720
So I used my newly
discovered instincts

20:53.721 --> 20:56.623
as a private investigator and,
with the help of a hair pin,

20:56.624 --> 20:58.124
I broke into
Greyson's apartment.

20:58.125 --> 20:59.559
- What?
- Don't worry, no.

20:59.560 --> 21:00.894
- He wasn't there or anything.
- Mary,

21:00.895 --> 21:02.729
you can't do things like that
without warning us.

21:02.730 --> 21:04.898
What? I was just doing
what us PIs do.

21:04.899 --> 21:06.499
- Is that not what we do?
- Breaking into

21:06.500 --> 21:08.702
a police detective's
apartment? No!

21:08.703 --> 21:10.570
Although I am very impressed
that you were able

21:10.571 --> 21:11.971
- to pick the lock.
- Frankie!

21:11.973 --> 21:14.874
However, in the future,
leave us a note.

21:14.875 --> 21:16.643
Right. Yeah, absolutely.

21:16.644 --> 21:18.244
Won't happen again, boss.

21:18.245 --> 21:20.180
But since the deed is done...
What did you find out?

21:20.181 --> 21:22.749
Well, I only very briefly
scanned the files,

21:22.750 --> 21:24.751
but it seems that Jack Ross
was an opium dealer

21:24.752 --> 21:26.619
who was murdered.
All the details

21:26.621 --> 21:28.488
- are in the photos.
- I'll develop them.

21:30.925 --> 21:33.793
The only thing missing
was the autopsy report.

21:39.066 --> 21:40.700
Is that the Jack Ross report?

21:40.701 --> 21:42.969
Hi, Flo. How are you?
Thanks again for all your help!

21:44.639 --> 21:45.705
Sorry.

21:45.706 --> 21:47.373
Having a bad day
with the boss.

21:47.375 --> 21:49.142
Moving on. Jack Ross.

21:49.143 --> 21:51.578
- Says here he was stabbed.
- Anything else?

21:51.579 --> 21:54.013
There was a handkerchief
discovered near the body.

21:54.015 --> 21:55.515
And testing
showed evidence

21:55.516 --> 21:57.050
of a certain chemical
in his system.

21:57.051 --> 21:59.586
- Diethyl ether.
- You got it.

21:59.587 --> 22:00.987
Anybody got a light?

22:05.393 --> 22:08.061
Jack Ross was etherized
and with a handkerchief too!

22:08.062 --> 22:09.562
Before he was stabbed.

22:09.563 --> 22:11.564
Also, we need
to thank Flo more often.

22:11.565 --> 22:12.632
What did you find?

22:12.633 --> 22:14.567
Greyson was the lead detective
on the case.

22:14.568 --> 22:16.569
And according to this,
the murder weapon,

22:16.570 --> 22:18.905
an ivory-handled knife,
was found at the murder scene

22:18.906 --> 22:20.673
and then later stolen
from police lock-up.

22:20.675 --> 22:23.576
So, two cases
both involving a stabbing

22:23.577 --> 22:24.611
ether and missing evidence.

22:24.612 --> 22:26.746
Seems whoever killed Elmer

22:26.747 --> 22:27.881
killed Ross as well.

22:27.882 --> 22:29.749
So Greyson took that evidence
because he knew

22:29.750 --> 22:30.750
the two cases
were connected.

22:30.751 --> 22:32.418
And he didn't want
either solved.

22:32.420 --> 22:34.754
- Is he trying to rail road Cici?
- It seems that way.

22:34.755 --> 22:35.755
The question is why?

22:35.756 --> 22:37.423
Is he working
for someone?

22:37.425 --> 22:38.525
Drake!

22:45.032 --> 22:46.299
Shhh!

22:50.705 --> 22:52.205
Detective Greyson!

22:52.206 --> 22:54.474
To what do I owe the pleasure?

22:57.712 --> 22:59.345
I found this under my desk.

23:00.581 --> 23:03.149
- Looks like a lens cap.
- It does look like a lens cap.

23:03.150 --> 23:04.884
I'm not an expert
at these things,

23:04.885 --> 23:07.387
but I'd say that
it's a spy issue lens cap.

23:07.388 --> 23:09.455
And what does that
have to do with me?

23:09.457 --> 23:11.891
Oh, it's interesting
you ask that question.

23:11.892 --> 23:12.926
Because I've been

23:12.927 --> 23:14.727
wracking my brain
trying to figure out...

23:15.896 --> 23:17.897
...who this lens cap
could belong to.

23:19.734 --> 23:21.835
So if the shoe fits...

23:24.405 --> 23:27.407
Just like Cinderella's slipper.

23:27.408 --> 23:31.177
That is a crazy coincidence.

23:31.178 --> 23:32.579
You know what's crazy, Drake?

23:32.580 --> 23:34.581
You breaking into my apartment,

23:34.582 --> 23:35.748
going through my things

23:35.750 --> 23:38.084
and then taking pictures
with your little camera.

23:38.085 --> 23:41.254
- That is crazy.
- Which is why I didn't do it.

23:41.255 --> 23:42.422
Oh, come on!

23:42.423 --> 23:44.757
I know you're interested
in the Ross file.

23:44.759 --> 23:45.859
You read it.

23:45.860 --> 23:47.493
The question is why?

23:47.495 --> 23:50.530
Jack Ross. Elmer Dunning.
They're connected.

23:50.531 --> 23:52.365
Yeah, they were both
stabbed to death.

23:52.366 --> 23:53.867
Oh, it's more than that
and you know it.

23:53.868 --> 23:56.202
Evidence was stolen
from both of those cases.

23:56.203 --> 23:58.037
- Is that so?
- A handkerchief that was found

23:58.038 --> 23:59.873
in your apartment
matches the same one

23:59.874 --> 24:01.641
- used in the Ross case.
- What?

24:01.642 --> 24:03.009
You know, it's bad enough
that you're covering up

24:03.010 --> 24:05.211
for a killer, but to rail road
my client as well?

24:05.212 --> 24:07.380
I've never railroaded anyone
in my entire life!

24:07.381 --> 24:09.716
An innocent woman
is gonna hang because of you!

24:09.717 --> 24:11.050
So just come out
with it already.

24:11.051 --> 24:12.218
Whose pocket are you in?

24:13.554 --> 24:15.488
That's very impressive.

24:17.558 --> 24:19.893
Really, really,
it's very impressive.

24:19.894 --> 24:22.262
Fine investigative work.

24:23.197 --> 24:24.330
And you're right.

24:25.900 --> 24:27.300
But you're also wrong.

24:29.069 --> 24:31.638
- How thick is this door?
- Shhh!

24:31.639 --> 24:33.573
Three months ago
I was the lead detective

24:33.574 --> 24:34.574
on a murder case.

24:34.575 --> 24:36.910
An opium dealer
named Jack Ross.

24:36.911 --> 24:38.745
- I know about the story.
- Kovac and Ross

24:38.746 --> 24:40.747
were sworn enemies.
Before I could prove anything,

24:40.748 --> 24:42.548
key evidence
just went missing.

24:42.550 --> 24:44.250
- The murder weapon.
- Yes.

24:44.251 --> 24:45.919
It disappeared
from the station lock-up.

24:45.920 --> 24:47.553
Now how does that happen?

24:47.555 --> 24:49.522
Only a cop
could have taken it.

24:49.523 --> 24:52.025
Exactly.
Somebody down at the station

24:52.026 --> 24:52.859
are on the take.

24:52.860 --> 24:53.860
They're...

24:53.861 --> 24:56.029
being paid by Kovac's gang.

24:56.030 --> 24:57.730
Question is who.

24:57.731 --> 24:59.532
This is ridiculous.

24:59.533 --> 25:01.434
- I'm going in there.
- What? No! Trudy!

25:04.872 --> 25:06.539
Miss Clarke.

25:06.540 --> 25:08.741
I didn't realize
that you were here.

25:08.742 --> 25:10.310
Please.
Don't let me interrupt.

25:11.378 --> 25:12.712
Do you want to get
your client off

25:12.713 --> 25:14.480
or are we working
at cross purposes here?

25:15.749 --> 25:16.883
Fine.

25:16.884 --> 25:18.851
It might help to know
everything what you know.

25:19.887 --> 25:22.021
Well, I know
the murders are connected.

25:22.022 --> 25:23.389
Let's start there.

25:23.390 --> 25:25.091
Is that the handkerchief
from the scene?

25:25.092 --> 25:26.559
Yes. It is.

25:26.560 --> 25:28.261
Do you know
where it's made?

25:28.262 --> 25:30.396
I have checked
every single store in town,

25:30.397 --> 25:31.764
and come up dry, yes.

25:31.765 --> 25:33.399
That embroidery
looks really familiar.

25:33.400 --> 25:34.901
I think I've seen
that design before.

25:34.902 --> 25:36.402
Mind if I hold onto it?

25:38.372 --> 25:39.672
Is there a problem, Greyson?

25:41.308 --> 25:42.575
You want to find
your dirty cop

25:42.576 --> 25:43.977
or are we at cross purposes?

25:44.912 --> 25:46.012
Fine.

25:46.013 --> 25:47.013
Great.

25:47.014 --> 25:49.015
So, how was Kovac
behind all of this

25:49.016 --> 25:50.683
when he was in prison
for the past six months?

25:50.684 --> 25:52.552
He's got Lou Hastings
doing his bidding.

25:52.553 --> 25:54.287
Lou was there
the night of the murder.

25:54.288 --> 25:55.722
Yeah, except Lou
didn't kill Elmer.

25:55.723 --> 25:58.224
- You seem awfully sure.
- I'll prove it.

25:58.225 --> 26:00.126
And I'll look
into this handkerchief.

26:00.127 --> 26:01.861
Perfect. Let's go.

26:01.862 --> 26:03.796
- Where are we going?
- Where do you think?

26:07.034 --> 26:08.234
Cici was here.

26:09.203 --> 26:10.970
The dancers were there.

26:10.971 --> 26:13.573
Elmer was stage right.

26:13.574 --> 26:17.076
And Lou was sitting right there.

26:17.077 --> 26:19.212
There's no way he could have
crossed through the club

26:19.213 --> 26:20.480
without anyone seeing him.

26:21.882 --> 26:23.383
You're not wrong.

26:23.384 --> 26:24.984
Somebody would have
seen him.

26:25.886 --> 26:26.886
Look at that.

26:26.887 --> 26:28.654
What's that red light bulb?

26:29.556 --> 26:31.424
That red light bulb?

26:31.425 --> 26:33.493
I've never seen it
before in my life.

26:35.062 --> 26:37.230
You can trust him.
He's on our side.

26:37.231 --> 26:38.898
Hard to believe,
I know.

26:38.899 --> 26:40.733
He's trying to help Cici.

26:43.237 --> 26:45.505
The cops were coming in,
threatening to shut us down.

26:45.506 --> 26:48.007
Sometimes even in plain clothes,
trying to pull a fast one.

26:48.008 --> 26:49.675
But Elmer had their number.

26:49.677 --> 26:51.210
He knew all of their faces.

26:51.211 --> 26:53.046
He rigged that red light

26:53.047 --> 26:54.614
so that when the law showed up,

26:54.615 --> 26:56.682
he could flip a switch
and alert the performer on stage

26:56.684 --> 26:58.351
to go into
her Sunday School routine.

26:58.352 --> 27:00.353
Pretty damn brilliant,
if you ask me.

27:00.354 --> 27:02.355
So was the light
on or off

27:02.356 --> 27:03.990
around the time
that Elmer was killed?

27:03.991 --> 27:06.025
There's only one person
who can answer that

27:06.026 --> 27:07.994
and she was holding feathers
at the time.

27:07.995 --> 27:09.395
Sure.

27:09.396 --> 27:11.364
The red light came on almost
as soon as I started my act.

27:11.365 --> 27:12.732
Just my luck, right?

27:12.733 --> 27:15.201
There I was, prancing around
like Sister Mary Margaret.

27:15.202 --> 27:17.203
- Did the light go off?
- Yeah.

27:17.204 --> 27:19.205
Seconds before the end,
thank goodness.

27:19.206 --> 27:20.573
At least I could go out
with a bang!

27:20.574 --> 27:22.542
If Elmer's warning system
was right,

27:22.543 --> 27:23.876
that means there was
a cop in the club

27:23.877 --> 27:25.545
- a the time of the murder.
- A cop?

27:25.546 --> 27:27.046
Well, isn't that just berries!

27:27.047 --> 27:28.981
I ain't ever getting
out of here, am I?

27:31.385 --> 27:32.885
If he somehow
made it backstage,

27:32.886 --> 27:35.221
that would explain
why Elmer thought he was gone

27:35.222 --> 27:36.556
and flipped the switch.

27:36.557 --> 27:38.724
The cop wasn't just
covering for Kovac...

27:38.726 --> 27:40.226
No. He was
killing for him.

27:40.227 --> 27:41.828
Call just came in,
Detective!

27:41.829 --> 27:43.663
Constable Donahue, what is it?

27:43.664 --> 27:45.431
You're needed
at 1239 Jarvis Street.

27:45.432 --> 27:47.266
That's Kovac's place.

27:50.004 --> 27:51.504
That's Nelson Kovac alright.

27:51.505 --> 27:53.172
How the hell
did he get out of jail?

27:53.173 --> 27:54.707
He wasn't scheduled
to be released

27:54.708 --> 27:56.342
- for another two weeks.
- He was paroled early.

27:56.343 --> 27:58.111
Got out just a few hours ago.

27:59.179 --> 28:00.613
Should she really be here?

28:02.516 --> 28:04.217
Mind your business, Constable.

28:05.185 --> 28:06.452
Understood.

28:09.356 --> 28:12.191
So, he was stabbed
several times.

28:12.192 --> 28:14.393
Yeah. No sign of a struggle.

28:14.395 --> 28:16.062
And no murder weapon.

28:32.079 --> 28:33.479
Strike three.

28:34.381 --> 28:35.481
I don't understand.

28:36.550 --> 28:38.584
I thought he was behind
the killings and now this.

28:38.585 --> 28:40.887
Now he's dead right after
he gets out of jail.

28:40.888 --> 28:42.889
The timing
can't be coincidence, can it?

28:42.890 --> 28:45.057
If the killer
was waiting for him...

28:45.059 --> 28:46.826
Hmm-mm. This might
have something to do

28:46.827 --> 28:48.127
with whatever put him
behind bars.

28:48.128 --> 28:49.529
So what's the story there?

28:49.530 --> 28:51.831
- I'll pull the original file.
- I'll meet you at Quon's.

28:51.832 --> 28:54.167
That is, if you still want
my two cents.

28:54.168 --> 28:55.835
We've come this far.

28:55.836 --> 28:57.837
So Greyson was unable
to track down

28:57.838 --> 28:59.338
where the handkerchief
came from?

28:59.339 --> 29:01.174
Well, he went through
official channels.

29:01.175 --> 29:03.176
And you're going through
unofficial channels?

29:03.177 --> 29:04.777
Something like that.

29:05.712 --> 29:07.013
Be honest.

29:07.014 --> 29:08.514
How do you like being
a private detective so far?

29:08.515 --> 29:09.849
Oh, it's great.

29:09.850 --> 29:11.184
Really.

29:11.185 --> 29:13.553
I mean, it's an adjustment
to be sure.

29:13.554 --> 29:15.888
I'm used to working in a more
straightforward manner.

29:15.889 --> 29:17.690
Obeying the law and such.

29:17.691 --> 29:18.858
But... don't get me wrong,

29:18.859 --> 29:21.027
you and Frankie do
very good work.

29:21.028 --> 29:23.696
It's just your tactics
are a bit underhanded.

29:23.697 --> 29:25.531
This coming
from the gal

29:25.532 --> 29:27.633
who broke into
her ex-boss' apartment.

29:29.203 --> 29:31.037
You have
a good point there, Trudy.

29:31.038 --> 29:32.538
Well, at least
you won't have to wear

29:32.539 --> 29:33.873
that awful uniform
anymore.

29:33.874 --> 29:36.876
Oh! Oh, I quite liked
my uniform.

29:36.877 --> 29:39.545
I always felt that it gave me
an air of authority

29:39.546 --> 29:40.880
while also freeing me
from the burden

29:40.881 --> 29:42.715
of having to choose
an outfit every day.

29:42.716 --> 29:44.550
Oh! There's something
to that.

29:44.551 --> 29:46.586
Now that you mention it,

29:46.587 --> 29:48.721
I was thinking
that Drake Private Detectives

29:48.722 --> 29:49.889
could use a sort of...

29:49.890 --> 29:52.225
detective-y uniform.

29:52.226 --> 29:53.426
You don't say.

29:53.427 --> 29:55.895
Matching hats would be
a very good start, I think.

29:55.896 --> 29:56.896
You know...

29:56.897 --> 29:58.664
Let's put a pin in that,
shall we?

30:00.901 --> 30:02.568
Is this
our unofficial channel?

30:02.569 --> 30:04.170
What were you expecting?

30:05.239 --> 30:08.007
An opium den
or a gambling hall...

30:08.909 --> 30:10.343
Definitely not this.

30:14.281 --> 30:16.682
Six months ago,
Kovac was arrested for murder.

30:16.683 --> 30:18.417
Seems he was moving
a shipment of booze

30:18.418 --> 30:20.753
when a rival mob showed up.
One of them got killed,

30:20.754 --> 30:23.756
along with a innocent bystander
who got caught in the crossfire.

30:23.757 --> 30:25.057
Who was the rival mob?

30:25.058 --> 30:26.592
Some of Bessie's boys.

30:26.593 --> 30:29.095
It says here
that Kovac has an alibi

30:29.096 --> 30:30.229
for the night of the murder.

30:30.230 --> 30:32.431
Yes. We got six months
for possession

30:32.432 --> 30:35.167
of illegal liquor.
A slap on the wrist.

30:35.169 --> 30:37.770
If the dirty cop
wasn't killing for Kovac,

30:37.771 --> 30:39.205
maybe he was working
for someone else.

30:39.206 --> 30:40.606
Bessie Starkman?

30:40.607 --> 30:43.609
- Better let me handle this.
- Be careful.

30:43.610 --> 30:46.545
Bessie's not the kind of person
you want to rub the wrong way.

30:46.547 --> 30:49.115
I'll decide
who I rub and how.

30:50.050 --> 30:51.317
Okay, boss.

30:58.725 --> 31:00.893
Alright. You got a minute?

31:00.894 --> 31:03.396
Frankie Drake.
You've got a lot of chutzpah.

31:03.397 --> 31:04.730
- Do I?
- Thought I made it clear

31:04.731 --> 31:06.399
we were enemies
the last time I saw you.

31:06.400 --> 31:08.234
Do I need Dario here
to remind you

31:08.235 --> 31:10.236
- what I do to my enemies?
- I'd rather you not.

31:10.237 --> 31:13.406
You got one minute. Talk.

31:13.407 --> 31:14.740
It's about another one
of your enemies.

31:14.741 --> 31:16.409
- Nelson Kovac.
- What about him?

31:16.410 --> 31:18.077
- He's dead.
- Tell me something

31:18.078 --> 31:20.479
- I don't already know.
- Did you do it?

31:20.480 --> 31:21.747
Why would I do that?

31:21.748 --> 31:23.449
Because he took out
one of your guys.

31:23.450 --> 31:25.751
He tried to steal
a shipment from Kovac.

31:25.752 --> 31:28.254
Kovac found out,
opened fire and killed him.

31:28.255 --> 31:30.089
I always tell my boys
not to play with matches.

31:30.090 --> 31:31.223
Fingers get burned.

31:31.225 --> 31:32.758
So you're not
behind the heist?

31:32.759 --> 31:34.593
You think
I put them up to that?

31:34.595 --> 31:36.762
Believe me,
if I wanted to rob Kovac,

31:36.763 --> 31:38.397
it wouldn't be
some sloppy stick up.

31:38.398 --> 31:40.599
So you didn't
take care of Kovac?

31:40.601 --> 31:42.435
Sounds like someone
took care of him for me.

31:42.436 --> 31:43.769
Minute's up.

31:52.045 --> 31:53.379
And you believe her?

31:53.380 --> 31:55.881
She had motive to get rid
of her rival bootlegger.

31:55.882 --> 31:57.383
Maybe even Ross.

31:57.384 --> 31:58.884
But why would she kill Elmer?

31:58.885 --> 32:00.086
That's a good question.

32:00.087 --> 32:01.387
Though I have
a little trouble believing

32:01.388 --> 32:02.788
she has a cop
on her payroll.

32:06.059 --> 32:08.060
Darn it!
Greyson is in there.

32:08.061 --> 32:10.663
Right. Not sure he should know
you're working with us.

32:12.566 --> 32:14.734
Let Frankie know
I helped, okay?

32:14.735 --> 32:16.001
Sure.

32:21.241 --> 32:23.342
- I figured out the handkerchief.
- Really?

32:24.911 --> 32:26.445
It was sewn
by a volunteer at my church,

32:26.446 --> 32:27.680
Alice Lehman.

32:27.681 --> 32:30.249
She made a bunch
for events and fundraisers,

32:30.250 --> 32:31.250
until about six months ago.

32:31.251 --> 32:32.418
What happened then?

32:32.419 --> 32:34.754
- She was killed.
- Six months ago...

32:34.755 --> 32:38.023
Who was the bystander killed
in Kovac's crossfire?

32:38.959 --> 32:40.025
One guess...

32:40.027 --> 32:41.761
Alice Lehman.

32:41.762 --> 32:44.230
The handkerchief
wasn't left by accident.

32:44.231 --> 32:45.531
It was a signature.

32:45.532 --> 32:47.366
This is a revenge killing.

32:47.367 --> 32:49.168
- Yeah.
- But why leave a handkerchief

32:49.169 --> 32:50.536
at the other two murders?

32:50.537 --> 32:52.371
- What's the connection?
- Okay, look at this.

32:52.372 --> 32:55.374
Donahue was first on the case
when Alice Lehman was killed.

32:55.375 --> 32:58.377
He was also on the Ross case.
And guess what?

32:58.378 --> 33:00.045
He was also the cop

33:00.047 --> 33:02.415
who pulled the knife
out of Cici's robe.

33:21.568 --> 33:22.601
Let me guess.

33:22.602 --> 33:24.236
Breaking and entering
is a crime.

33:24.237 --> 33:25.404
You read my mind.

33:25.405 --> 33:26.739
I can't do this
without a warrant.

33:26.740 --> 33:28.240
I can.

33:28.241 --> 33:30.342
Hmmmm.

33:34.581 --> 33:35.748
What's the matter, Drake?

33:35.749 --> 33:36.916
I would have thought
picking locks

33:36.917 --> 33:39.351
- was one of your specialties.
- One of many.

33:42.422 --> 33:44.423
Look at that.
They left the door open.

33:44.424 --> 33:46.459
- Real cute.
- You coming?

33:50.697 --> 33:52.364
I have a feeling
you're going to be

33:52.366 --> 33:53.966
a bad influence on me.

33:55.202 --> 33:56.535
I'm gonna look in here.

33:56.536 --> 33:57.636
Okay.

34:28.568 --> 34:29.835
I found something.

34:30.737 --> 34:31.837
Ivory handle.

34:36.076 --> 34:37.342
Donahue!

34:55.695 --> 34:56.962
Nice hook.

34:58.865 --> 35:00.200
It does the trick.

35:04.160 --> 35:05.661
Why don't you tell us,
constable,

35:05.662 --> 35:07.262
what's the knife
that killed Jack Ross

35:07.264 --> 35:10.165
doing under your bed?
Um? Tell me.

35:10.166 --> 35:11.667
There's even
a little blood on it.

35:11.668 --> 35:13.302
Sloppy for a cop.

35:13.303 --> 35:15.504
Seems to me
that you killed Jack Ross

35:15.505 --> 35:17.973
and used the same knife
to kill Nelson Kovac.

35:17.974 --> 35:19.742
Who are you working for?

35:20.677 --> 35:22.011
Who am I working for?

35:22.012 --> 35:24.380
I'm working
for the good citizens

35:24.381 --> 35:25.514
of Toronto.

35:25.515 --> 35:27.349
Our streets
are becoming infested

35:27.350 --> 35:29.785
with sex, drugs and corruption.

35:29.786 --> 35:31.520
That's why you killed Elmer.

35:31.521 --> 35:33.422
It was you
in The Krazy Kitten that night.

35:33.423 --> 35:35.958
You slipped by,
waited for him backstage,

35:35.959 --> 35:37.659
but you weren't expecting Cici,
were you?

35:37.661 --> 35:39.028
She deserved it.

35:39.029 --> 35:41.230
You call that filth dancing?

35:42.165 --> 35:43.365
Someone has
to take out the trash.

35:43.366 --> 35:44.733
And that someone is you?

35:44.734 --> 35:47.469
We're not talking about
a couple of jaywalkers here

35:47.470 --> 35:48.971
They're scum

35:48.972 --> 35:50.139
and they're everywhere.

35:50.140 --> 35:52.307
Our job's to uphold the law,
Constable,

35:52.309 --> 35:53.809
not to take it
into our own hands.

35:53.810 --> 35:56.478
This is happening
right under our noses, Greyson

35:56.479 --> 35:58.313
and we're letting them slip
through the cracks.

35:58.315 --> 35:59.748
Thanks for the tip.

36:02.986 --> 36:04.820
To Mary's first closed case.

36:04.821 --> 36:06.121
The first of many I hope.

36:07.357 --> 36:09.491
I still can't believe
that Constable Donahue did it.

36:09.492 --> 36:12.961
To think of all the cups of tea
that I made for that monster...

36:13.997 --> 36:15.330
You're awfully quiet,
Frankie.

36:16.666 --> 36:17.900
I just... I can't
shake the feeling

36:17.901 --> 36:19.835
- that we missed something.
- But Constable Donahue

36:19.836 --> 36:22.037
- confessed to all three murders.
- I know. But...

36:22.038 --> 36:23.672
It's the ivory-handled knife.

36:23.673 --> 36:25.641
Donahue used that
to kill Ross,

36:25.642 --> 36:27.676
and then he stole it
out of evidence

36:27.677 --> 36:30.179
- and used it to kill Kovac.
- Yet he used another knife

36:30.180 --> 36:31.880
- to kill Elmer.
- Exactly.

36:31.881 --> 36:33.849
Oh, I see what you mean.

36:33.850 --> 36:35.184
It's worth another look.

36:35.185 --> 36:37.186
- Chat with Flo?
- It's a start.

36:37.187 --> 36:38.854
- You coming?
- Uh...

36:38.855 --> 36:40.289
No. You gals go ahead.

36:40.290 --> 36:41.323
I'll meet you
back at the office.

36:41.324 --> 36:42.925
I just want
to mull this over a bit.

36:42.926 --> 36:45.060
So Donahue was here...

36:59.809 --> 37:03.479
Officer Woods.

37:03.480 --> 37:05.614
Oh! Muriel! It's Mary.

37:05.615 --> 37:07.483
Muriel, do you remember
when you said

37:07.484 --> 37:08.617
that I should just ask you

37:08.618 --> 37:10.319
if there's anything
you could do for me?

37:10.320 --> 37:12.154
Well, there's something
that you can do for me.

37:12.155 --> 37:13.522
Of course.

37:13.523 --> 37:15.157
It's about the burlesque case.

37:15.158 --> 37:16.658
I've been thinking
about it a bit,

37:16.659 --> 37:18.060
in my spare time of course,

37:18.061 --> 37:19.661
and there's something
that's occurred to me.

37:19.662 --> 37:21.029
I thought
that case was closed.

37:21.031 --> 37:22.998
Oh! Oh! It is, but...

37:22.999 --> 37:25.334
Still though, uh...
Would you mind very much

37:25.335 --> 37:27.336
checking into the whereabouts
of Constable Donahue

37:27.337 --> 37:29.071
when the call came in
about Elmer Dunning?

37:29.072 --> 37:30.339
Of course.

37:30.340 --> 37:32.574
I'd be happy to.
Where are you?

37:32.575 --> 37:34.510
I'm just about to head over
to The Krazy Kitten.

37:34.511 --> 37:35.711
I'm gonna walk this out again.

37:36.880 --> 37:38.514
You're going to make
a great cop one day, Mary.

37:38.515 --> 37:39.982
I just know it.

37:46.289 --> 37:47.556
Oh!

37:53.129 --> 37:55.464
Three victims,
stabbed and etherized.

37:55.465 --> 37:57.132
They definitely seem
quite similar.

37:57.133 --> 37:59.468
- No anomaly?
- Even something minor?

37:59.469 --> 38:00.869
Now that you mention it,

38:00.870 --> 38:03.472
the cut on Dunning's neck
isn't as deep as the other two

38:03.473 --> 38:05.641
and shows slight signs
of hesitation.

38:05.642 --> 38:07.643
Could be the work
of a weaker man.

38:07.644 --> 38:08.810
Or a woman.

38:08.812 --> 38:10.579
But it's a cop,
so it can't be a woman.

38:11.481 --> 38:13.215
That's not entirely true.

38:14.150 --> 38:17.753
So, Elmer was lying here...

38:18.655 --> 38:22.758
Cici was standing back here...

38:23.827 --> 38:27.262
Greyson walked up to me here...

38:28.665 --> 38:30.866
Oh! Muriel!

38:30.867 --> 38:32.801
- You startled me.
- I'm so sorry.

38:32.802 --> 38:34.169
What are you doing here?

38:34.170 --> 38:35.470
I looked into
Donahue's whereabouts

38:35.472 --> 38:36.805
like you asked.

38:36.806 --> 38:38.006
Oh, you didn't have to come
all the way down here

38:38.007 --> 38:39.174
to tell me that.

38:39.175 --> 38:41.376
But since you're here...
What did you find out?

38:41.377 --> 38:42.611
You were right.

38:42.612 --> 38:44.780
He was investigating a robbery
a few blocks away

38:44.781 --> 38:46.982
- when the emergency call came in.
- Really?

38:46.983 --> 38:48.317
Do you know
what this means?

38:48.318 --> 38:50.452
That he couldn't
have killed Elmer Dunning.

38:53.289 --> 38:56.692
You know, Donahue's intentions
were actually quite admirable.

38:56.693 --> 38:57.960
Excuse me?

38:57.961 --> 38:59.628
His methods may have been
a bit extreme,

38:59.629 --> 39:01.396
but he was certainly
doing our city a favour.

39:01.397 --> 39:04.466
He saw Toronto the Good
becoming a den of iniquity.

39:04.467 --> 39:06.568
Well, I wouldn't put it
quite like that...

39:08.471 --> 39:09.671
I would.

39:09.672 --> 39:12.040
Alice Lehman was just
a God-fearing woman

39:12.041 --> 39:13.642
on her way home from church
when she was struck down

39:13.643 --> 39:15.344
by a senseless
act of violence.

39:16.646 --> 39:18.747
I remember it
like it was yesterday.

39:19.983 --> 39:21.683
It's hard to forget
an image like that.

39:21.684 --> 39:23.252
Muriel, you were there?

39:24.487 --> 39:26.388
She was one
of my dearest friends.

39:26.389 --> 39:28.257
I'm so sorry.

39:28.258 --> 39:29.324
I'm not.

39:29.325 --> 39:31.493
It was just the awakening
we needed.

39:31.494 --> 39:32.661
We?

39:32.662 --> 39:34.630
Officer Donahue
was first on the scene.

39:35.999 --> 39:37.599
It was devastating.

39:38.835 --> 39:41.003
But it was also the moment
that we both realized

39:41.004 --> 39:42.671
something had to be done.

39:42.672 --> 39:45.173
You see, Mary, these degenerates
are tearing apart

39:45.175 --> 39:46.775
the very moral fabric
of our society.

39:46.776 --> 39:48.343
Yes, but that's why
we have the police...

39:48.344 --> 39:50.445
Constable Donahue
understood that.

39:51.781 --> 39:54.082
Alas, the good constable
won't be around any longer

39:54.083 --> 39:55.450
to help us
save our city.

39:56.386 --> 39:57.853
His mantle will have
to be passed down

39:57.854 --> 39:59.621
to somebody else,
I suppose.

39:59.622 --> 40:01.690
Muriel,
what are you suggesting?

40:01.691 --> 40:03.225
You said yourself
you wanted to make the world

40:03.226 --> 40:04.760
a better place.

40:04.761 --> 40:06.962
There's a way
to do just that.

40:06.963 --> 40:09.031
And it's more effective
than measuring hemlines.

40:09.032 --> 40:11.199
Yes, but if we operate
outside of the law,

40:11.201 --> 40:12.701
we're no better
than the criminals.

40:14.204 --> 40:15.804
You're either part
of the solution...

40:17.540 --> 40:19.308
...or you're part
of the problem.

40:20.376 --> 40:22.144
Muriel!

40:30.553 --> 40:31.586
Mary! You're okay?

40:31.588 --> 40:33.055
Yeah. I... I think so.

40:34.724 --> 40:37.159
Thank goodness you gals
got here in time.

40:37.160 --> 40:39.161
Thank goodness
you left us a note.

40:39.162 --> 40:40.330
Oh, yeah...

40:49.553 --> 40:50.720
Thanks again, Frankie.

40:50.721 --> 40:52.555
I really thought
I was cooked there.

40:52.556 --> 40:53.556
So what are you going
to do now?

40:53.557 --> 40:55.558
Get out
of this outfit to start.

40:55.559 --> 40:57.593
I've been marinating
in it for days.

40:57.594 --> 40:59.729
- And then what?
- Hard to say.

40:59.730 --> 41:01.898
I mean, you spend
a few days in the clink,

41:01.899 --> 41:04.233
you really start to re-evaluate
your life decisions.

41:04.234 --> 41:05.902
Thinking of
changing professions?

41:05.903 --> 41:07.069
What are you, nuts?

41:07.071 --> 41:08.337
I'm at the top of my game!

41:10.741 --> 41:12.508
I think someone's
here for you.

41:16.246 --> 41:18.581
Vera thinks we should run
The Krazy Kitten together.

41:18.582 --> 41:20.082
Be our own bosses.

41:20.084 --> 41:21.184
What do you think?

41:22.252 --> 41:23.252
I think the two of you

41:23.253 --> 41:25.321
have something
pretty special there.

41:27.424 --> 41:28.591
Make sure to thank

41:28.592 --> 41:30.226
that Officer Shaw for me,
will you?

41:30.227 --> 41:31.928
I don't know
what I would've done

41:31.929 --> 41:33.029
without the two of you.

41:38.702 --> 41:40.203
You know, Drake...

41:40.204 --> 41:42.071
You might just have a future

41:42.072 --> 41:43.706
in this whole PI thing.

41:43.707 --> 41:45.541
Thanks. You're not...

41:45.542 --> 41:47.376
a half bad detective yourself.

41:47.378 --> 41:49.712
Keep it up and I might
consider hiring you one day.

41:49.713 --> 41:51.914
- That's quite the offer.
- I'm feeling generous.

41:51.915 --> 41:54.550
So... are you gonna tell me
how you figured out

41:54.551 --> 41:56.219
that Muriel was involved
in this whole thing?

41:56.220 --> 41:58.454
- I got a tip.
- A tip? Really?

41:58.455 --> 42:00.857
I thought you and I had reached
a new understanding.

42:00.858 --> 42:02.558
- We have.
- Hmmm.

42:02.559 --> 42:04.293
Doesn't mean
I'm in your pocket.

42:04.294 --> 42:06.496
A girl has to have
her independence.

42:08.732 --> 42:10.500
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

42:19.076 --> 42:20.343
Hello!

42:22.579 --> 42:24.180
So...

42:25.249 --> 42:26.582
I have good news and bad news.

42:26.583 --> 42:28.251
You got
your job back.

42:28.252 --> 42:29.952
I'm afraid so.

42:29.953 --> 42:31.087
But I'll still be able
to help out

42:31.088 --> 42:32.522
whenever I possibly can.

42:33.424 --> 42:34.757
I'm a cop at heart.

42:34.758 --> 42:37.026
And I... can't work
the same way you gals do.

42:37.027 --> 42:40.263
I just don't have that same kind
of... flexibility.

42:40.264 --> 42:43.366
Well, let's say you shine in
a more structured environment.

42:43.367 --> 42:45.535
How did you convince Greyson
to take you back?

42:45.536 --> 42:48.371
Actually, it didn't take
much convincing.

42:48.372 --> 42:49.605
He just called me up

42:49.606 --> 42:51.941
and admitted to acting rash
in the heat of the moment.

42:51.942 --> 42:53.543
How very reasonable
of him.

42:53.544 --> 42:56.412
And then he said:
"At least I'm not a murderess."

42:56.413 --> 42:58.381
Sounds like you have
all the credentials.

42:58.382 --> 42:59.515
Yeah...

42:59.516 --> 43:02.718
Well, gals,
I better be back to the station.

43:02.719 --> 43:03.719
And remember...

43:03.720 --> 43:05.488
I'm just a phone call away.

43:07.391 --> 43:08.724
It's probably
for the best.

43:08.725 --> 43:11.394
I was not looking forward
to the matching hats.

43:11.395 --> 43:12.895
The what?

43:12.896 --> 43:14.898
I'll tell you about it
some other time.

43:14.899 --> 43:21.387
