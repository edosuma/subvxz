UKRAINIAN INVASION CELEBRATION
SPECTACULAR!"
WITH YOUR HOSTS, TUCKER CARLSON

00:12.278 --> 00:26.693
AND LAURA INGRAHAM!
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> HI.

00:26.693 --> 00:32.832
>> GOOD EVENING.
I'M TUCKER CARLSON.
I'M LIKE A PAIR OF BOAT SHOES

00:32.832 --> 00:38.071
CAME TO LIFE.
>> AND I'M LAURA INGRAHAM.
AND WHEN I WATCH "HARRY POTTER"

00:38.071 --> 00:42.208
I ROOT FOR VOLDEMORT.
>> WE GOT INTO A LITTLE BIT OF
TROUBLE FOR ALL THE NICE THINGS

00:42.208 --> 00:44.944
WE SAID ABOUT RUSSIA AND THE
MEAN THING WE SAID ABOUT
UKRAINE.

00:44.944 --> 00:48.314
>> WE DID SOUND PRETTY AWFUL IN
HINDSIGHT.
AND FORESIGHT.

00:48.314 --> 00:51.151
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> I KEPT ASKING WHY DO WE HATE
PUTIN?

00:51.151 --> 00:56.356
AREN'T LIBERALS IN AMERICA EVEN
WORSE?
>> AND I CALLED THE PRESIDENT OF

00:56.356 --> 00:59.292
UKRAINE PATHETIC.
HE STAYED AND FOUGHT WITH HIS
PEOPLE IN THE WAR AND I CALLED

00:59.292 --> 01:02.862
HIM PATHETIC FROM A NEWS DESK IN
WASHINGTON.
[ LAUGHTER ]

01:02.862 --> 01:09.135
>> I KEPT SAYING WE SHOULD BE
MORE WORRIED ABOUT OUR OWN
BORDER GETTING INVADED BY

01:09.135 --> 01:13.606
MEXICO.
BUT IN MY DEFENSE, I AM RACIST.
SO I THOUGHT THAT WAS TRUE.

01:13.606 --> 01:16.109
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> BUT TONIGHT WE'RE GOING TO
MAKE IT UP OW.

01:16.109 --> 01:22.315
WE'RE RAISING MONEY FOR THE REAL
VICTIMS OF THIS INVASION.
THE OLIGARCHS.

01:22.315 --> 01:24.084
[ LAUGHTER ]
BECAUSE WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT
THE BABIES.

01:24.084 --> 01:29.456
THEIR SUGAR BABIES.
WHO WILL POUR VODKA IN THEIR
MOUTHS?

01:29.456 --> 01:33.393
SO MANY HORNY MOUTHS TO FEED.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> SO PLEASE OPEN YOUR WALLETS

01:33.393 --> 01:36.896
AND BECAUSE THIS IS FOX NEWS YOU
CAN EITHER SEND MONEY OR TAKE
OUT A REVERSE MORTGAGE.

01:36.896 --> 01:44.738
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO FAR WE'VE RAISED OVER 8.3
BILLION RUBLES, WHICH COMES OUT

01:44.738 --> 01:47.707
TO ALMOST $12.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> AND THIS IS INCREDIBLY

01:47.707 --> 01:50.877
EXCITING.
FORMER AND CURRENT PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES DONALD TRUMP

01:50.877 --> 01:59.119
IS MANNING THE PHONE LINES
HIMSELF.
>> AND THE THING IS ABOUT

01:59.119 --> 02:03.056
RIHANNA, SHE CAN PULL IT OFF.
SHE CAN BE NINE MONTHS.
THE BODY'S STILL INCREDIBLE.

02:03.056 --> 02:06.059
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT NOW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A
LOT OF WOMEN WEEK, SEEING THIS

02:06.059 --> 02:11.798
RIGHT NOW, 3s, 4s, FRANKLY
TROLLS, WEARING THE SAME
SEE-THROUGH SHIRT.

02:11.798 --> 02:15.235
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HESITATE TO SAY WHALES BECAUSE
I KNOW THE WHALES, I'M VERY

02:15.235 --> 02:18.071
POPULAR WITH THE WHALES.
I DO GREAT WITH WHALES.
THEY COME UP TO ME ON THE BEACH

02:18.071 --> 02:22.909
AND THEY SAY THANK YOU, MR.
PRESIDENT.
YOU KNOW, THE BLOWHOLES BLASTING

02:22.909 --> 02:26.646
AWAY.
200, 300 FEET IN THE AIR.
IT'S HOW THEY SALUTE ME.

02:26.646 --> 02:28.515
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> OKAY.
WE'LL COME BACK TO YOU, MR.

02:28.515 --> 02:31.217
PRESIDENT, BECAUSE OUR FIRST
GUEST IS HERE.
HE'S A GREAT AMERICAN PATRIOT.

02:31.217 --> 02:36.589
SO GREAT THAT HE LEFT AMERICA
AND BECAME A RUSSIAN CITIZEN.
THE PUFFIEST ACTION STAR IN THE

02:36.589 --> 02:44.998
WORLD, STEVEN SEAGAL.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> THANK YOU.

02:44.998 --> 02:48.535
THANK YOU, TUCKER.
OH, WHAT A GLOBAL CRISIS WE ARE
FACING.

02:48.535 --> 02:56.409
AS SOMEONE WHO PROUDLY PRETENDS
TO BE BOTH NATIVE AMERICAN AND
JAPANESE, I FEEL FOR ALL PEOPLE.

02:56.409 --> 02:59.512
>> NOW, YOU'RE CLOSE WITH
PRESIDENT PUTIN, RIGHT?
>> YES.

02:59.512 --> 03:05.719
PUTIN AND I ARE, AS THEY SAY IN
ANCIENT JAPAN, ESKIMO BROTHERS.
[ LAUGHTER ]

03:05.719 --> 03:12.625
SO I WILL BE HONORING PUTIN BY
PERFORMING AN AUTHENTIC
TAEKWONDO EXHIBITION.

03:12.625 --> 03:16.463
HA-YA.
HA-YA.
EE-YO.

03:16.463 --> 03:23.703
NOW IT'S TIME TO HONOR MYSELF
WITH A TRADITIONAL JAPANESE
SHAMROCK SHAKE.

03:23.703 --> 03:30.343
THE TRADITIONAL SEASONAL
BEVERAGE OF ALL AIKIDO
EXHIBITIONS.

03:30.343 --> 03:37.350
HA-YA.
[ APPLAUSE ]
>> LET'S CHECK BACK IN WITH THE

03:37.350 --> 03:42.922
MAN WHO SAID PUTIN'S INVASION
WAS VERY SMART AND ALSO SAID
CHINA SHOULD INVADE TAIWAN NEXT.

03:42.922 --> 03:47.527
MR. PRESIDENT?
>> MY FAVORITE FOOD IS PROBABLY
BREAD.

03:47.527 --> 03:50.597
YOU KNOW?
AND MORE SPECIFICALLY BUN.
I LIKE BUN.

03:50.597 --> 03:53.366
BUN IS GREAT.
ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO
BURGER.

03:53.366 --> 03:58.705
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
BEYOND BURGER.
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

03:58.705 --> 04:03.610
I WANT TO STAY RIGHT AT BURGER.
BEYOND IS NOT GOOD.
JOE BIDEN HAS GONE BEYOND BURGER

04:03.610 --> 04:06.046
AND IT HAS NOT GONE SO WELL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:06.046 --> 04:08.915
NEITHER HAS REBOOT OF FRESH
PRINCE.
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT AND I'M

04:08.915 --> 04:13.219
LAUGHING AND I'M LAUGHING BUT I
DON'T KNOW WHY.
[ LAUGHTER ]

04:13.219 --> 04:15.855
>> OKAY.
I DO HEAR A DIAL TONE ON THE
OTHER END OF THAT PHONE.

04:15.855 --> 04:19.426

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE
PERFORMING A DUET IN HONOR OF

04:57.130 --> 05:03.436
RUSSIA AND UKRAINE COMING
TOGETHER.
[ APPLAUSE ]

05:03.436 --> 05:10.276
* TELL ME SOMETHING BOY *
* DON'T YOU LOVE THAT BIG
RUSSIAN CONVOY *

05:10.276 --> 05:18.651
OR DO YOU NEED MORE THIS *
* INVASION GETS ME
SO DAMN HARD

05:18.651 --> 05:25.425
IN THE SHALLOW SHALLOW
WE'RE FAR FROM *

05:25.425 --> 05:37.203
I'M ON THE DEEP END
WE SHOULD TAKE UKRAINE
WAY MORE WHITE THAN BLACK *

05:37.203 --> 05:41.074
>> WOW, ALL RIGHT.
I'M GOING TO CUT THAT ONE A
LITTLE SHORT.

05:41.074 --> 05:47.147
THANK YOU, GUYS.
[ APPLAUSE ]
>> IS THERE A BATHROOM WITH A

05:47.147 --> 05:54.554
MIRRORED COUNTER NEARBY?
>> YEAH, MAN, IT'S MAR-A-LAGO.
COME ON.

05:54.554 --> 05:58.992
ALL RIGHT.
GUYS, I DO HAVE A QUICK
AANNOUNCEMENT.

05:58.992 --> 06:05.298
IS ANYBODY DRIVING A YACHT WITH
A LICENSE PLATE NYET MEANS DA?
YOUR BOAT IS CURRENTLY BEING

06:05.298 --> 06:10.170
TOWED BY NATO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> ALSO, PUTIN HAS JUST

06:10.170 --> 06:13.373
CRIMINALIZED FREE SPEECH AND
SHUT DOWN ALL INDEPENDENT NEWS
ORGANIZATIONS.

06:13.373 --> 06:19.346
>> YEAH.
SO I'M THINKING CAN WE PLEASE DO
THAT TO CNN?

06:19.346 --> 06:24.050
>> EVERY TIME I LAUGH AN ANGEL
DIES.
[ LAUGHTER ]

06:24.050 --> 06:29.055
>> NOW LET'S TAKE A QUICK BREAK.
WHEN WE COME BACK WE'LL BE
GIVING AWAY A FREE T-SHIRT.

06:29.055 --> 06:32.058
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
THE FRONT SAYS "I'D STORM THE
CAPITOL."

06:32.058 --> 06:36.463
AND THE BACK SAYS "THIS DOES NOT
CONSTITUTE AN ADMISSION OF
GUILT."

06:36.463 --> 06:42.502
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> AND PLUS WIN TICKETS TO SEE
MATT GAETZ DO A LIVE READING OF

06:42.502 --> 06:45.505
HIS FAVORITE RUSSIAN NOVEL,
"LOLITA."
>> AND I'VE GOT SOMETHING I'D

06:45.505 --> 06:52.312
LIKE TO SAY TO PUTIN AS WELL.
VLADIMIR, I WANT YOU TO HEAR
THIS FROM ME.

06:52.312 --> 06:55.515
YOU ARE SMART.
YOU IS KIND.
YOU IS IMPORTANT.

06:55.515 --> 07:03.423
AND HERE'S A LITTLE SONG FROM ME
TO YOU.
* MY FUNNY VALENTINE *

07:03.423 --> 07:13.833
* SWEET COMIC VALENTINE *

HEART *

07:13.833 --> 07:20.240
* YOUR LOOKS ARE LAUGHABLE *
* UNPHOTOGRAPHABLE *

07:20.240 --> 07:22.742
ART *
>> THANK YOU --
[ LAUGHTER ]

07:22.742 --> 07:26.813
* IS YOUR FIGURE LESS THAN
GREEK *
* IS YOUR MOUTH A LITTLE WEAK *

07:26.813 --> 07:34.454
* WHEN YOU OPEN TO SPEAK *

>> ALL RIGHT.

07:34.454 --> 07:41.494

07:52.972 --> 07:55.375
I LOVE YOU, VLAD.
>> I KNOW.
HE LOVES YOU TOO.

07:55.375 --> 08:01.748
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!
SATURDAY NIGHT!

08:01.748 --> 08:14.461
SATURDAY NIGHT!
>> IT'S "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE."
WITH --

09:32.405 --> 09:58.398
FEATURING --

09:58.398 --> 10:07.607
FEATURING --
MUSICAL GUEST CHARLI XCX.
AND YOUR HOST, OSCAR ISAAC.

10:11.611 --> 10:18.685
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
OSCAR ISAAC!

10:29.863 --> 10:31.798
>> THANK YOU.
OH, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU!

10:31.798 --> 10:35.235
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I'M SO EXCITED TO BE HERE.
THIS IS MY FIRST TIME HOSTING

10:35.235 --> 10:42.208
"SNL."
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THANK YOU.

10:42.208 --> 10:46.646
THEY ACTUALLY ASKED ME TO HOST
BACK IN 2015 BUT I SAID "NO, I'M
NOT READY.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.249
I WANT TO WAIT UNTIL AFTER THE
PANDEMIC."
AND THEY WERE LIKE, "WHAT

10:49.249 --> 10:52.619
PANDEMIC?"
[ LAUGHTER ]
MY NAME IS OSCAR ISAAC, BUT MY

10:52.619 --> 10:58.625
FULL NAME IS
OSCAR ISAAC HERNANDEZ ESTRADA.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

10:58.625 --> 11:03.797
I SAID TO HOLLYWOOD -- I SAID TO
THEM, "YOU CAN PICK TWO OF THESE
NAMES."

11:03.797 --> 11:07.701
GUESS WHAT THEY WENT WITH.
THE WHITE ONES.
[ LAUGHTER ]

11:07.701 --> 11:13.373
I'M HALF GUATEMALAN, HALF CUBAN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OR AS CASTING DIRECTORS CALL

11:13.373 --> 11:17.844
THAT, "ETHNICALLY AMBIGUOUS."
[ LAUGHTER ]
ACCORDING TO THEM, I CAN PLAY

11:17.844 --> 11:23.083
ANYTHING FROM A PHARAOH TO
TIMOTHEE CHALAMET'S DADDY.
YOU KNOW THAT JOKE, A PRIEST, A

11:23.083 --> 11:26.186
RABBI, AND A MINISTER WALK INTO
A BAR?
YEAH, I COULD PLAY ANYONE IN

11:26.186 --> 11:29.389
THAT JOKE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT I AM EXCITED.

11:29.389 --> 11:36.629
I'M JOINING THE MARVEL UNIVERSE
WITH "MOON KNIGHT."
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

11:36.629 --> 11:39.966
YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF A FULL
CIRCLE MOMENT SINCE THE FIRST
MOVIE I WAS EVER IN WAS CALLED

11:39.966 --> 11:45.638
"THE AVENGER."
NOT "THE AVENGERS," WHICH WAS A
MASSIVE BLOCKBUSTER.

11:45.638 --> 11:48.808
NO, THIS WAS "THE AVENGER,"
WHICH IS A MOVIE THAT I WROTE,
DIRECTED, AND STARRED IN WHEN I

11:48.808 --> 11:54.381
WAS 10 YEARS OLD.
IT WAS SHOT ON LOCATION IN MY
BUDDY BRUCE FERGUSON'S BACK YARD

11:54.381 --> 11:57.584
IN OUR HOMETOWN OF MIAMI,
FLORIDA.
I PLAY A NINJA ASSASSIN TRAINING

11:57.584 --> 12:03.390
TO FIGHT HIS NEMESIS.
AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE A CLIP.
THIS IS REAL, CHECK THIS OUT.

12:04.758 --> 12:10.063
>>  OKAY, THERE'S THE OPENING
TITLE.
AND THERE I AM.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.499
KIND OF LOSING MY BALANCE A
LITTLE BIT.
PERFECT EDITING.

12:12.499 --> 12:16.970
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND HERE COMES MY BIG STUNT.
I TRAINED TWO MONTHS FOR THIS.

12:16.970 --> 12:24.444
YAH!
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
I MEAN, ARGUABLY BETTER THAN THE

12:24.444 --> 12:28.915
REAL "AVENGERS."
AND I MADE IT FOR HALF THE
BUDGET, ONLY $110 MILLION.

12:28.915 --> 12:31.384
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT I TOOK IT REALLY SERIOUSLY.
MAYBE A LITTLE TOO SERIOUSLY.

12:31.384 --> 12:37.757
LIKE IN THIS SCENE.
OKAY, THERE I AM ACTING MY HEART
OUT.

12:37.757 --> 12:41.995
AND THERE'S MY FRIEND'S DAD
CLEANING THE POOL.
SHOUT-OUT TO MR. FERGUSON, AND

12:41.995 --> 12:47.534
SHOUT-OUT TO MY BUDDY, BRUCE.
HE'S AT HOME WATCHING AND HE HAD
NO IDEA OUR OLD MOVIE WAS GOING

12:47.534 --> 12:50.303
TO BE ON "SNL."
I ACTUALLY HAD TO SIGN A
LICENSING AGREEMENT TO SHOW IT.

12:50.303 --> 12:55.775
THAT'S TRUE.
NBC UNIVERSAL NOW OWNS "THE
AVENGER."

12:55.775 --> 13:03.750
COMING THIS FALL TO PEACOCK!
[ APPLAUSE ]
I'VE GOT ONE MORE CLIP.

13:03.750 --> 13:09.055
THIS IS A SCENE I DID WITH
MYSELF WHERE I PLAY BOTH PARTS.
OKAY?

13:09.055 --> 13:18.098
HERE WE GO.
THAT'S ME.
I'M MY OWN HENCHMAN.

13:18.098 --> 13:24.804
UH-OH.
NOW WATCH WHAT I DO WITH THE
SWORD.

13:24.804 --> 13:28.141
TOTAL COMMITMENT FROM THE START.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOW, YOU MIGHT BE ASKING, OSCAR,

13:28.141 --> 13:31.745
WHY DID YOU USE YOUR MONOLOGUE
TO SHOW US THESE OLD HOME
VIDEOS?

13:31.745 --> 13:41.087
AND THE REASON IS IT'S IMPORTANT
TO ENCOURAGE KIDS TO BE WEIRDOS.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

13:41.087 --> 13:48.895
BECAUSE EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE
ONE OF THOSE WEIRDOS GROWS UP TO
HOST "SNL."

13:48.895 --> 13:51.431
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.500
CHARLI XCX IS HERE.
SO STICK AROUND.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.101
SO STICK AROUND.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

14:05.045 --> 14:10.050
HEREBY PRESENT THE PAW PATROL
WITH THIS MEDAL OF BRAVERY FOR
STOPPING THAT OUT-OF-CONTROL HOT

14:10.050 --> 14:15.855
AIR BALLOON.
WITH YOU PUPS ON PATROL, OUR
CITY IS IN GOOD HANDS.

14:15.855 --> 14:23.363
>> DON'T YOU MEAN GOOD PAWS?
>> HA HA HA!
>> ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

14:23.363 --> 14:27.801
I'M CITY COUNCILMAN
HERB TANGIER.
MAYOR GOODWAY HAS PUT ALL OUR

14:27.801 --> 14:32.472
LIVES AT RISK WITH HER PAW
PATROL INITIATIVE AND I SAY IT'S
TIME TO VOTE HER OUT.

14:32.472 --> 14:37.744
FACT!
THIS MAN FIRED ALL OF OUR CITY'S
POLICE OFFICERS, FIREFIGHTERS,

14:37.744 --> 14:41.414
AND PARAMEDICS, AND REPLACED
THEM WITH A GROUP OF SIX TALKING
DOGS.

14:41.414 --> 14:43.883
[ LAUGHTER ]
I THINK THAT WAS A BAD IDEA.
AND I'M NOT ALONE.

14:43.883 --> 14:50.256
LISTEN TO THESE CONCERNED
CITIZENS.
>> I WAS EXCITED ABOUT THE PAW

14:50.256 --> 14:54.227
PATROL AT FIRST.
TALKING DOGS WHO KNOW HOW TO FLY
JETS AND DRIVE?

14:54.227 --> 14:59.866
GREAT.
BUT IT'S BECOME CLEAR THAT SIX
DOGS CANNOT PROTECT A CITY

14:59.866 --> 15:05.905
ROUGHLY THE SIZE OF SAN DIEGO.
>> CRIMINALS AND LOW-LIFES ARE
FLOCKING HERE BECAUSE THEY KNOW

15:05.905 --> 15:12.212
THERE'S ONLY ONE COP PATROLLING
OUR STREETS AND IT'S A DOG!
>> AND THERE'S ONLY ONE

15:12.212 --> 15:17.951
FIREFIGHTER, ALSO A DOG.
SO IF THERE'S TWO FIRES AT THE
SAME TIME?

15:17.951 --> 15:24.524
SOMEONE'S GETTING SCREWED, I
GUESS?
WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THIS

15:24.524 --> 15:28.762
ORGANIZATION?
A CHILD?
>> YES!

15:28.762 --> 15:31.698
THE PAW PATROL IS RUN BY A
10-YEAR-OLD BOY NAMED RYDER.
WHO IS THIS KID?

15:31.698 --> 15:36.302
BEATS ME!
AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL, HE HAS NO
PARENTS AND DOESN'T GO TO

15:36.302 --> 15:42.442
SCHOOL.
BUT MAYBE THAT'S FOR THE BEST,
BECAUSE WITH ALL OUR TAX DOLLARS

15:42.442 --> 15:46.579
PAYING FOR A LITTLE COCKAPOO'S
JET PACK, WE NOW HAVE THE WORST
SCHOOLS IN THE STATE.

15:46.579 --> 15:52.352
THIS IS MY 17-YEAR-OLD SON.
HE CAN BARELY READ.
>> I CAN READ, I JUST DON'T KNOW

15:52.352 --> 15:56.389
WHAT SOUND VOWELS MAKE WHEN
THEY'RE NEXT TO OTHER LETTERS IN
A LINE.

15:56.389 --> 16:00.660
>> MAYOR GOODWAY, THIS IS ALL
YOUR FAULT AND YOU NEED TO GO!
>> FACT.

16:00.660 --> 16:04.464
OUR CITY'S COVID RESPONSE WAS A
NATIONAL DISGRACE.
WHY?

16:04.464 --> 16:09.269
BECAUSE SIX DOGS WERE IN CHARGE
OF IT.
>> FACT.

16:09.269 --> 16:16.810
CHASE THE POLICE DOG'S ONLY
WEAPON IS A NET.
QUESTION, HOW IS A NET GOING TO

16:16.810 --> 16:24.150
HELP IF A LUNATIC ON BATH SALTS
IS EATING MY FACE?
ANSWER?

16:24.150 --> 16:30.256
IT WON'T.
>> FACT, MARSHALL THE FIRE DOG
IS MY FAVORITE ONE.

16:30.256 --> 16:35.428
HE'S THE FUNNIEST PUP BY FAR AND
THE COOLEST BY A MILE.
BUT I DON'T THINK HE COULD CARRY

>> SORRY, NO.
>> TRY TO REALLY FOCUS THIS
TIME.

SAYS, "DAMN, DO YOU LIVE AT THE
GYM OR SOMETHING?

BECAUSE THAT JUICY BOOTY SLAPS."

>> DONALD SAYS TO MARIA, "HEY,
N-WORD, ARE YOU GOING TO THE GYM
LATER?

25:22.655 --> 25:26.326
OR AM I GOING TO HAVE TO DRAG
YOUR THICK ASS THERE MYSELF?"
>> THAT'S REALLY AWFUL AND

25:26.326 --> 25:30.897
INAPPROPRIATE.
>> ACTUALLY, IT'S FINE.
>> ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT.

25:30.897 --> 25:36.069

WORD.
HE MEANT NICE.

25:36.069 --> 25:42.175
>> HE WAS SAYING, HEY NICE?
>> YEAH.
BECAUSE HE'S ITALIAN.

>> WOW, SO YOU SEE A MAN AND A
WOMAN WORKING TOGETHER, SO
AUTOMATICALLY YOU THINK THEY'RE

26:03.496 --> 26:08.868
HAVING RAW INTERCOURSE?
>> NO ONE SAID THAT.

AND JUST BECAUSE YOUR EYES ARE
GOING OWOOGA THINKING SHE'LL

ME TO NOT ONE DOCTOR'S
APPOINTMENT.
[ LAUGHTER ]

46:58.618 --> 47:02.555
>> WAIT, WHY WOULD I?
>> BECAUSE YOU DID THIS TO ME.
>> I DID?

47:02.555 --> 47:08.495
>> MM-HMM.
I SAID LET'S USE PROTECTION.
AND YOU LOOKED ME IN THE EYE AND

47:08.495 --> 47:13.133
SAID "IT DON'T FEEL THE SAME."
>> THAT DOES SOUND LIKE ME, YES.
[ LAUGHTER ]

47:13.133 --> 47:16.903
>> ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT
TO GO.
I LEFT MY KIDS IN LORNE'S

47:16.903 --> 47:19.739
OFFICE.
>> PAULINE, EVERYBODY.
>> I'M YOUNGER THAN RIHANNA.

47:19.739 --> 47:22.275
I'M ONLY 29.
For "Weekend Update," I'm
Colin Jost.

47:22.275 --> 47:23.843
For "Weekend Update," I'm
Colin Jost.
>> I'm Michael Che. Good night.

47:34.220 --> 47:38.625
YOU KNOW, OVER MY TEN YEARS ON
THE SHOW, I HAVE PLAYED DOZENS
OF TEACHERS, PRINCIPALS,

47:38.625 --> 47:44.464
MOTHERS, WOMEN NAMED DIANE,
SUSAN, OR TEACHER.
AND I HAVE LOVED ALL OF THESE

47:44.464 --> 47:50.070
SWEET, NURTURING WOMEN.
BUT THE SHOW SAID THAT IF I
PLAYED 150 OF THEM, THEN AS A

47:50.070 --> 47:56.176
REWARD I COULD WRITE A SKETCH OF
MY OWN CHOOSING.
YOU KNOW, TO SHOW A DIFFERENT

47:56.176 --> 48:00.513
SIDE OF MYSELF.
SO TONIGHT, THIS IS THAT SKETCH.
ENJOY.

48:00.513 --> 48:06.886
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> I'M SO NERVOUS, I CAN'T
BELIEVE SIEGFRIED'S GOING TO

48:06.886 --> 48:11.491
TAKE ME, A LOSER AND A FOOL.
HOW DO I LOOK?
>> YOU LOOK FANTASTIC, SIR.

48:11.491 --> 48:16.029
I'M SURE SHE'LL BE TITILLATED.
>> BUT YOU'RE RIGHT TO BE
SCARED.

48:16.029 --> 48:23.636
SHE IS THE MOST WIDELY DESIRED
WOMAN IN THE WORLD.
>> OH, I'M SICK.

48:23.636 --> 48:26.639
I'M SICK WITH FEELING FOR THIS
WOMAN.
[ DOORBELL ]

48:26.639 --> 48:31.211
IT'S HER.
PRAY FOR ME BOYS.
**

48:31.211 --> 48:33.780
>> HELLO.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
NOW, SCRAM, BOYS, AND LEAVE THIS

48:33.780 --> 48:38.284
MAN TO ME.
>> MY GOD.
YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL.

48:38.284 --> 48:45.825
AND SEXUAL.
AND I CAN TELL YOUR
PERSONALITY'S ALSO REALLY GOOD.

48:45.825 --> 48:50.063
>> OH GOD, IF I HAD A NICKEL FOR
EVERY TIME I HEARD A MAN SAY
THAT, I WOULD HAVE SO MANY COINS

48:50.063 --> 48:56.603
THAT IT WOULD BE ANNOYING.
>> OH, SENSUAL WOMAN.
YOU MAKE ME SO HORNY.

48:56.603 --> 49:03.109
I SEE WHY THEY CALL YOU THE
SEXUAL WOMAN.
>> SO YEAH, I LIED TO

49:03.109 --> 49:07.647
OSCAR ISAAC.
I TOLD HIM I HAVE A FAMOUS
RECURRING CHARACTER ON THE SHOW

49:07.647 --> 49:15.488
CALLED "THE SEXUAL WOMAN."
IS THAT A CRIME?
**

49:15.488 --> 49:23.329
>> OH, I'M THE LUCKIEST MAN ON
EARTH TO BE BRUSHING YOUR HAIR.
MIND IF I GET A LITTLE CLOSER?

49:23.329 --> 49:31.838
>> OH, SURE.
BRING YOUR HEAD AND BODY THAT
LOOK LIKE THAT CLOSER TO ME,

49:31.838 --> 49:33.640
WHATEVER.
I DON'T CARE.
>> I NEED YOU TO KNOW, I SEE YOU

49:33.640 --> 49:37.911
SEXUALLY.
I DON'T SEE YOU AS SOMEONE WHO
WOULD, LIKE, RUN A SCHOOL.

49:37.911 --> 49:45.185
I MEAN, YOU ARE THE MOST UNDER
35 PERSON I'VE EVER MET.
>> OH, STOP IT, YOU FLIRT.

49:45.185 --> 49:49.689
>> WELL, I BET YOU WERE ABOUT TO
DO YOUR BIG CATCHPHRASE.
>> UH -- OH, RIGHT.

49:49.689 --> 49:57.364
YES.
MY FAMOUS CATCHPHRASE.
OF COURSE.

49:57.364 --> 50:02.168
WHAT WAS IT?
HERE WE GO.
HEY, GET YOUR FAT ASS ON MY LAP,

50:02.168 --> 50:06.339
BITCH!
>> OKAY.
YES.

50:06.339 --> 50:16.249
>> OOH.
>> I MUST CONFESS, I HAVE A BIG
I MUST CONFESS, I HAVE A BIG,

50:16.249 --> 50:22.922
COOL BONER RIGHT NOW WHICH I
SOMETIMES GET WHEN I RESPECT
SOMEONE TOO MUCH.

50:22.922 --> 50:25.525
>> NOW, WHY DID I CHOOSE
OSCAR ISAAC FOR THE SKETCH?
NO REASON.

50:25.525 --> 50:29.129
I MEAN, PRETTY RANDOM.
EVERY TIME I'VE DONE SOMETHING
ROMANTIC ON THE SHOW, IT'S BEEN

50:29.129 --> 50:34.000
TOTALLY RANDOM.
LIKE WITH RYAN GOSLING.
OR DRAKE.

50:34.000 --> 50:40.140
OH, MY GOD.
DO I HAVE A PATTERN OF SEXUAL
RANDOMNESS?

50:40.140 --> 50:48.148
WELL, WHATEVER.
YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE.
NOW BACK TO THE SKETCH.

50:48.148 --> 50:54.454
>> IS THE FOOD ALL RIGHT?
I HOPE YOU EVEN LIKE SPAGHETTI.
>> YOU'RE LUCKY THAT I DO.

50:54.454 --> 50:58.358
>> DAMN IT, I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU
AND IT'S KILLING ME!
>> OH!

50:58.358 --> 51:02.228
YES.
TO ME THIS IS NORMAL BEHAVIOR.
>> I WROTE A SONG FOR YOU, IF

51:02.228 --> 51:10.937
THAT'S OKAY.
**
* SEXUAL WOMAN ARE YOU FROM

51:10.937 --> 51:15.342

SO MUCH I'VE JUST
DEMONSTRATED BY MY INSANE
BONER *

51:24.818 --> 51:28.955
>> OH.
A BONER?
LET ME GUESS.

51:28.955 --> 51:32.592
YOU WANT TO KISS ME NOW.
>> YES, I DO.
BUT NOT YET.

51:32.592 --> 51:40.500
YOU NEED TIME TO DIGEST ALL THAT
SPAGHETTI.
SO NOW COULD WE JUST HUG?

51:40.500 --> 51:43.103
>> YES, GOOD IDEA.
I WOULD HAVE FORGOTTEN TO DIGEST
AND REGRETTED IT LATER.

51:43.103 --> 51:49.976
>> OH, WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT YOU
IS TRUE.
YOU ARE EVERYONE'S CUP OF TEA.

51:49.976 --> 51:54.881
INCLUDING ME, OSCAR ISAAC.
>> OH, I KNOW, OSCAR ISAAC.
>> SORRY.

51:54.881 --> 51:58.651
IS THAT -- IT SAYS MY REAL NAME
ON THE CARD.
IS THAT A MISTAKE?

51:58.651 --> 52:03.523
>> I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS -- THE WRITERS ARE SO
ANNOYING AND STUPID.

52:03.523 --> 52:05.525
I WOULD SAY I GUESS JUSTIFY GO
WITH IT?
>> OKAY.

52:05.525 --> 52:13.133
ALL RIGHT.
THEN LET'S GET MY FAT ASS ON
YOUR LAP.

52:13.133 --> 52:16.236

AS BUILDING A SHELF *
* YOUR DIY BECOMES OMG

52:34.554 --> 52:42.562
YOU'RE IN OVER YOUR HEAD *
>>> WELL, HELLO.
I'M GUS VANZANT.

52:42.562 --> 52:49.235
AND WELCOME TO "IN OVER YOUR
HEAD" WHERE WE TALK TO FOLKS WHO
GOT A LITTLE OVERCONFIDENT

52:49.235 --> 52:52.672
TAKING ON PROJECTS AROUND THE
HOUSE.
SPONSORED BY THUMB ICE.

52:52.672 --> 52:59.846
DID YOU WHACK YOUR THUMB WITH A
HAMMER LIKE A CARTOON IDIOT?
NUMB THE PAIN WITH THUMB ICE.

52:59.846 --> 53:01.781
OUR FIRST GUEST IS TOMMY DORIAN,
WHO SAID HE TRIED TO INSTALL HIS
OWN POOL.

53:01.781 --> 53:07.787
UH-OH.
COME ON IN, TOMMY.
**

53:07.787 --> 53:10.757
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, LOOKS LIKE YOUR HAIR'S
STILL A LITTLE WET FROM THE POOL

53:10.757 --> 53:16.162
THERE, TOMMY.
>> NO, THAT'S UNRELATED.
[ LAUGHTER ]

53:16.162 --> 53:24.304
>> OKAY.
SO TELL US, WHAT WAS BEHIND YOUR
THINKING BEHIND BUILDING YOUR

53:24.304 --> 53:26.339
OWN POOL?
>> WELL, MY NEIGHBOR PUT ONE IN.
HIRED A WHOLE CREW AND AN

53:26.339 --> 53:28.108
ARCHITECT.
THE WHOLE NINE YARDS.
I THOUGHT, IT'S BASICALLY A HOLE

53:28.108 --> 53:31.845
PLUS A HOSE.
WHY OVERTHINK IT?
>> UH-HUH.

53:31.845 --> 53:36.149
AND WHEN DID THINGS GO WRONG?
>> ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, GUS.
MY PROBLEM STARTED WHEN I TRIED

53:36.149 --> 53:39.686
TO POUR THE CONCRETE WHILE I WAS
STILL DIGGING, TO SAVE TIME.
>> OH, WOW.

53:39.686 --> 53:43.656
>> OH WOW IS RIGHT.
CUT TO, I'M UP TO MY WAIST IN
HARD CONCRETE SCREAMING, "HELP!

53:43.656 --> 53:46.659
SOMEONE TURN OFF THE HOSE!"
>> SO YOU WERE ALREADY RUNNING
THE HOSE?

53:46.659 --> 53:51.231
>> TO FILL THE POOL, TO SAVE
TIME, YES.
HAD TO HAVE IT OPEN FOR NEW

53:51.231 --> 53:54.200
YEAR'S.
>> WELL, LOOKING BACK, ANY
REGRETS?

53:54.200 --> 53:58.271
>> I DO WISH I HADN'T PUNCTURED
MY SEPTIC TANK.
THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT KIND OF

53:58.271 --> 54:14.621
POOL.
>> THANKS FOR COMING, TOMMY.
>> THANKS FOR ALLOWING ME.

54:14.621 --> 54:17.157
[ LAUGHTER ]
[ APPLAUSE ]
>> ALL RIGHT.

54:17.157 --> 54:20.060
OUR NEXT GUEST THOUGHT THAT HE
SHOULD, QUOTE, DO HIS OWN
ELECTRICAL.

54:20.060 --> 54:27.334
PLEASE WELCOME FELIX CREWE!
**
>> HEY GUS.

54:27.334 --> 54:35.709
LONG TIME, FIRST TIME.
>> YOU MEAN, LONG TIME WATCH,
FIRST-TIME GUEST?

54:35.709 --> 54:38.845
>> NO.
FIRST TIME ELECTROCUTED.
LONG TIME IT HURT.

54:38.845 --> 54:41.481
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> SO, HOW DID YOU DECIDE TO DO
YOUR OWN ELECTRICAL WORK?

54:41.481 --> 54:43.249
>> WELL, I KEEP TELLING MY WIFE,
IT'S JUST WIRES.
BABE, IT'S JUST WIRES.

54:43.249 --> 54:48.988
HONEY, NOTHING'S GOING TO
HAPPEN, IT'S WIRES.
>> RIGHT.

54:48.988 --> 54:53.393
>> YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SEE A GUY
DEFUSING BOMBS IN THE MOVIES YOU
THINK, I COULD DO THAT?

54:53.393 --> 54:56.830
>> I'VE NEVER THOUGHT THAT.
>> WELL, I HAVE A LOT.
SO I THOUGHT, "WHAT THE HELL,

54:56.830 --> 55:00.600
I'M GOING TO INSTALL MY OWN
CIRCUIT BREAKER."
>> OH, MY GOD.

55:00.600 --> 55:07.941
>> NO, TRUST ME, THERE IS NO
GOD.
NOW, THE WHOLE IDEA OF A BREAKER

55:07.941 --> 55:13.680
IS TO STOP A POWER SURGE, RIGHT?
SO, I THINK I SHOULD START WITH
THE POWER DIALED ALL THE WAY UP

55:13.680 --> 55:16.850
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING
TO PROTECT MYSELF AGAINST,
RIGHT?

55:16.850 --> 55:20.320
>> THAT IS VERY BAD LOGIC.
>> SO I GOT THIS THING CRANKED
UP HIGHER THAN LIGHTNING AND I'M

55:20.320 --> 55:27.527
LIKE, "TIME TO SCREW IN THE
METAL SCREWS," RIGHT?
>> NO, NOT RIGHT.

55:27.527 --> 55:33.667
>> CUT TO -- I FLY SO HARD
THROUGH A SHEET OF DRYWALL THAT
MY SCREAM PHYSICALLY DETACHES

55:33.667 --> 55:35.735
FROM MY BODY AND TRAVELS AT A
SLOWER SPEED.
KIND OF LIKE PETER PAN'S SHADOW

55:35.735 --> 55:40.840
DETACHING FROM HIS BODY.
>> YEAH, GOT IT.
>> SO AFTER I HIT A STEEL

55:40.840 --> 55:46.212
SUPPORT COLUMN, WIPING OUT THE
ENTIRE FIRST FLOOR OF MY HOME, I
AM HIT IN THE FACE BY MY OWN

55:46.212 --> 55:51.918
SCREAM.
WILD, RIGHT?
>> WOW.

55:51.918 --> 55:53.987
AND WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM ALL
OF THIS?
>> GLOVES.

55:53.987 --> 56:04.431
YOU'VE GOT TO WEAR GLOVES.
>> WELL, THANK YOU, FELIX.
>> EXCITED TO GET MY CHECK.

56:04.431 --> 56:06.866
>> THERE'S NO CHECK.
[ APPLAUSE ]
>> ALL RIGHT.

56:06.866 --> 56:11.237
AND OUR FINAL GUEST SAYS THAT
SHE'S BEEN TRYING TO REPAIR HER
HOME FOR MONTHS.

56:11.237 --> 56:15.308
PLEASE WELCOME -- THIS CAN'T BE
RIGHT.
MY WIFE CARLISA.

56:15.308 --> 56:19.679
**
HEY, BABY.
UH, WHAT YOU DOING HERE?

56:19.679 --> 56:24.417
>> JUST TRYING TO REPAIR MY
HOME.
THIS DAMN FOOL IS OUT HERE

56:24.417 --> 56:28.822
PRETENDING HE'S A BIG EXPERT.
MEANWHILE, HIS OWN HOUSE IS
LITERALLY FALLING APART.

56:28.822 --> 56:32.692
>> WELL, IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM,
BABY, I'M HAPPY TO FIX IT.
>> WITH WHAT?

56:32.692 --> 56:36.696
THIS IS YOUR TOOLBOX.
BUT THERE AREN'T NO TOOLS IN
HERE, THOUGH.

56:36.696 --> 56:39.833
IT'S JUST CANS OF BLACK'S BEER.
>> HEY, I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR
THOSE.

56:39.833 --> 56:45.672
>> THERE'S NO TOOLS IN THIS
WHOLE GOOFY-ASS WORKSHOP.
IT'S JUST CHOCOLATE BARS THAT

56:45.672 --> 56:50.343
LOOK LIKE TOOLS.
>> WELL, SOMETIMES I GET A
LITTLE HUNGRY.

56:50.343 --> 56:53.079
>> MEANWHILE, OUR TOILET HASN'T
WORKED IN MONTHS.
I OPENED THE LID OF THE TANK AND

56:53.079 --> 57:02.188
SAW THIS.
>> WELL, YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU
MIGHT NEED AN ICE COLD HOT DOG.

57:02.188 --> 57:07.327
>> AND THEN YOU SNUCK SOME
CRUSHED UP PEANUT SHELLS INTO
OUR SON'S LUNCH TO PROVE THAT HE

57:07.327 --> 57:21.574
WAS FAKING HIS PEANUT ALLERGY.
>> WELL, THE IMPORTANT THING IS
THAT I TRUST YOU NOW.

57:21.574 --> 57:24.044
I STILL THINK HE MAY BE
EXAGGERATING A LITTLE BIT.
>> GUS.

57:24.044 --> 57:25.879
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY FOR
YOURSELF?
>> LOOK.

57:25.879 --> 57:27.914
I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT I
AM --
* IN OVER MY HEAD *

57:27.914 --> 57:32.452
>> NO, NO, NO.
DON'T YOU DARE SING THAT DAMN
JINGLE TO ME, NO.

57:32.452 --> 57:38.692
THIS MAN SUCKED UP A WASP NEST
WITH A VACUUM AND NOW HE WON'T
EVEN THROW IT AWAY.

57:38.692 --> 57:42.829
>> LISTEN, DYSON --
>> IDIOT.
YOU'S AN IDIOT.

57:42.829 --> 57:45.565
>> IDIOT.
YOU'S AN IDIOT.
>> YOU WANT SOME OF THIS --

57:59.179 --> 58:00.246

1:01:16.543 --> 1:01:19.846
>> WELL, ACTUALLY, SIR -- I
DON'T THINK WE'VE EVER ACTUALLY
SPOKEN.

1:01:19.846 --> 1:01:23.650
BUT I FEEL LIKE I ALWAYS SEE YOU
WITH A DIFFERENT BOOK.
YOU LIKE READING?

1:01:23.650 --> 1:01:27.220
>> OH, YEAH.
YES, MA'AM.
IT'S HOW I'VE SEEN THE WORLD TEN

1:01:27.220 --> 1:01:32.525
TIMES OVER, BECAUSE OF MY BOOKS.
>> I LOVE THAT.
YOU EVER TRY ANY WRITING?

1:01:32.525 --> 1:01:36.963
>> I MEAN, I DABBLE.
BUT NO, MAYBE ONE DAY.
YOU ALL ARE THE WRITERS.

1:01:36.963 --> 1:01:42.602
>> WELL, WHY DON'T YOU READ US
SOMETHING?
WHATEVER YOU GOT.

1:01:42.602 --> 1:01:46.706
>> OH, I DON'T KNOW.
>> HEY, HEY.
NO JUDGMENTS HERE.

1:01:46.706 --> 1:01:51.211
WE'RE ALL JUST TRYING STUFF OUT.
PROMISE.
>> COME ON, MAN, TAKE A SEAT.

1:01:51.211 --> 1:01:54.814
>> YEAH, I'D LOVE TO HEAR IT,
PAL.
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1:01:54.814 --> 1:02:00.320
>> GOSH, THAT'S SO NICE.
I'VE NEVER READ IN FRONT OF
PEOPLE BEFORE.

1:02:00.320 --> 1:02:03.723
THIS ONE'S CALLED "THE APOGEE OF
MIDNIGHT."
>> OH, LOVELY.

1:02:03.723 --> 1:02:08.728
PLEASE.
>> OKAY.
THERE IT WAS AGAIN.

1:02:08.728 --> 1:02:12.365
THE SOUND OF MOP ON TILE.
THE START OF ANOTHER LATE NIGHT.
ONE OF THOUSANDS LIKE IT.

1:02:12.365 --> 1:02:16.536
ALONE IN CHANDLER HIGH.
BUT THE JANITOR LIKED THE
SILENCE.

1:02:16.536 --> 1:02:21.107
IT HELD HIM IN A COOL, DELICATE
CALM.
>> HM, WOW, I REALLY LIKE THAT.

1:02:21.107 --> 1:02:27.547
>> THANK YOU.
THEN, FOOTSTEPS.
LOUD AND GETTING CLOSER.

1:02:27.547 --> 1:02:33.286
HELLO?
SCHOOL'S CLOSED.
A WOMAN TURNED THE CORNER.

1:02:33.286 --> 1:02:37.290
SHE LOOKED LOST.
SORRY, I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEONE
NAMED MIKE?

1:02:37.290 --> 1:02:43.763
OH, YEAH?
WHO'S ASKING?
MY NAME IS DUA LIPA.

1:02:43.763 --> 1:02:47.901
I'M A BIG POP STAR AND I'M
LOOKING FOR A JANITOR NAMED
MIKE.

1:02:47.901 --> 1:02:55.308
>> OKAY.
>> THE JANITOR PAUSED.
THAT WAS HIS NAME.

1:02:55.308 --> 1:03:00.513
DUA LIPA SIGHED.
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF ME, HAVE
YOU?

1:03:00.513 --> 1:03:04.651
SORRY, MA'AM.
MORE OF A CLASSIC ROCK GUY
MYSELF.

1:03:04.651 --> 1:03:08.555
BUT SURE, MAYBE I'VE SEEN A
BIKINI PIC OR TWO, HOW CAN I
HELP?

1:03:08.555 --> 1:03:14.594
>> OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, IT IS
GETTING PRETTY LATE.
SO I THINK WE SHOULD PROBABLY

1:03:14.594 --> 1:03:16.196
WRAP IT UP.
>> WHAT?
HE JUST STARTED.

1:03:16.196 --> 1:03:19.632
>> WRAP UP?
SO I CAN MOP?
HECK, I GOT TIME.

1:03:19.632 --> 1:03:23.503
>> YEAH, AND I WANT TO KNOW
WHERE IT'S GOING.
>> I DON'T.

1:03:23.503 --> 1:03:28.108
>> YEAH, I THINK I'M GOOD.
>> YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M BAD AT THIS.

1:03:28.108 --> 1:03:32.612
>> NO, NO.
WE SUPPORT IT.
SO PLEASE, GO AHEAD.

1:03:32.612 --> 1:03:37.550
>> OH, THANK YOU.
MIND IF I SIT DOWN?
DUA LIPA WAS EXHAUSTED.

1:03:37.550 --> 1:03:42.088
SHE'D JUST DONE A CONCERT IN
EUROPE.
AND WAS STILL IN HER SPARKLY

1:03:42.088 --> 1:03:46.960
SHOW GETUP.
HE LIKED HER.
SHE WAS COOL.

1:03:46.960 --> 1:03:51.297
SO WHAT BRINGS YOU OUT ALL THIS
WAY TO SEE LITTLE OLD ME,
GIRLIE?

1:03:51.297 --> 1:03:59.105
OH, I DON'T KNOW, THIS IS GOING
TO SOUND CRAZY.
COME ON, DUA LIPA, YOU KNOW YOU

1:03:59.105 --> 1:04:03.610
CAN TALK TO ME.
I'M YOUR FRIEND.
IT'S TRUE.

1:04:03.610 --> 1:04:08.815
THEY WERE FAST FRIENDS.
AND NOTHING MORE.
RIGHT?

1:04:08.815 --> 1:04:18.224
>> ARE YOU ASKING US?
>> PLEASE.
I'M STILL READING.

1:04:18.224 --> 1:04:21.695
WELL, I GUESS I WANTED TO ASK
YOU A FAVOR, MIKE.
SURE THING, GIRLIE.

1:04:21.695 --> 1:04:24.664
WHAT'S UP?
WOULD YOU TEACH ME HOW TO MAKE
OUT?

1:04:24.664 --> 1:04:28.268
I'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE.
>> OKAY, I'M SORRY, I JUST --
NO.

1:04:28.268 --> 1:04:35.075
>> OH, COME ON.
>> WHY?
>> LOOK, I THINK THAT IT'S GREAT

1:04:35.075 --> 1:04:39.779
THAT YOU WRITE.
I JUST DON'T REALLY WANT TO
HEAR ABOUT YOUR WEIRD, MADE-UP

1:04:39.779 --> 1:04:41.247
THING WITH DUA LIPA.
I'M SORRY, I DON'T.
>> MY THING?

1:04:41.247 --> 1:04:44.317
THIS AIN'T ME, MAMA, THIS IS
FICTION.
THIRD PERSON.

1:04:44.317 --> 1:04:50.890
>> YEAH, ABOUT A JANITOR NAMED
MIKE.
>> RIGHT.

1:04:50.890 --> 1:04:56.529
>> AND SO WHAT IS YOUR NAME?
>> MICHAEL B. JACKSON.
WHY?

1:04:56.529 --> 1:05:03.169
>> IT'S KIND OF CREEPY, MAN.
>> VERY CREEPY.
>> I SEE.

1:05:03.169 --> 1:05:05.939
I GUESS I'M NOT A WRITER AFTER
ALL.
BACK TO THE TOILETS IT IS.

1:05:05.939 --> 1:05:09.175
>> JUST FINISH IT, PLEASE.
>> OKAY, COOL.
OKAY.

1:05:09.175 --> 1:05:14.447
SURE, DUA LIPA, I CAN TEACH YOU
HOW TO MAKE OUT.
WAIT, CAN MY FRIEND COME?

1:05:14.447 --> 1:05:23.189
HER NAME IS TAWNY McDANIELS.
THE FAMOUS GINGER MILF?
ONE AND THE SAME.

1:05:23.189 --> 1:05:29.763
YOU KNOW HER?
KNOW HER?
I MANAGE HER SUB BRAND.

1:05:29.763 --> 1:05:33.500
OF COURSE PORNOGRAPHY HASN'T
BEEN THE SAME SINCE THE '70s.
THAT'S BEFORE T.J. MUNST TOOK

1:05:33.500 --> 1:05:40.373
OVER AT STUFFED.
WHEN THE MAGS HAD VISION AND THE
SPREADS WERE ACTUALLY GOOD.

1:05:40.373 --> 1:05:43.510
>> SORRY, I DO THINK WE NEED TO
CALL IT THERE.
I'M SORRY.

1:05:43.510 --> 1:05:47.247
>> OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.
STUFF HAPPENS, STUFF HAPPENS,
SO, DUA LAUGHED.

1:05:47.247 --> 1:05:52.419
HA HA HA!
HEY, MICHAEL B., THANKS.
THIS TRULY WAS THE APOGEE OF

1:05:52.419 --> 1:05:58.825
MIDNIGHT.
AMEN.
CHAPTER 2.

1:05:58.825 --> 1:06:02.762
>> AMEN?
>> CHAPTER 2?
THAT WASN'T THE END?

1:06:02.762 --> 1:06:08.435
>> OH, HONEY, WE GOT 800 PAGES
IN BOOK ONE, STRAP IN.
>> HAVE A GREAT NIGHT, EVERYONE.

1:06:08.435 --> 1:06:10.603
GET HOME SAFE.
OKAY?
>> ALL RIGHT.

1:06:10.603 --> 1:06:13.573
OKAY?
>> ALL RIGHT.
