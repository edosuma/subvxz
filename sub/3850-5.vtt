08:38.299 --> 08:39.482
- Where you been?
- Brunching.

08:39.508 --> 08:42.543
With some fabulous new
girlfriends of mine...

08:42.568 --> 08:44.636
one of them snap-dab in the middle

08:44.661 --> 08:46.569
of a juicy threesome.

08:47.025 --> 08:50.461
You know, it reminded me of the time

08:50.486 --> 08:52.970
you and I hooked up on that flight to Rio

08:52.995 --> 08:55.003
and the stewardess caught us,

08:55.028 --> 08:56.701
and she asked if she can join in.

08:56.726 --> 08:57.837
- Mm.
- Uh-huh.

08:57.862 --> 08:59.393
Someone had a glass of wine.

08:59.418 --> 09:00.797
Someone had <i> two.</i>

09:00.832 --> 09:02.801
Listen, I have a meeting in an hour,

09:02.826 --> 09:04.878
but I could push it
back if I found something

09:04.903 --> 09:07.387
that, uh... distracts me.

09:07.412 --> 09:10.848
Oh, I would love to,
darling, but I am buried.

09:10.873 --> 09:12.929
You know what would be really helpful...

09:12.954 --> 09:16.066
if you signed these papers I
left out for you this morning,

09:16.091 --> 09:18.059
because you know how insane it makes me

09:18.084 --> 09:19.585
when I have to ask you twice.

09:19.610 --> 09:21.244
What... what... what are these?

09:21.269 --> 09:22.952
- Really?
- [Chuckles]

09:22.977 --> 09:25.612
Come on, this is the
approval for my accessory line

09:25.637 --> 09:27.889
to use the font and logo
of the Calista Raines line.

09:28.225 --> 09:30.336
Do you <i> ever</i> listen
when I talk to you about work?

09:30.361 --> 09:33.694
I listen to you... just
not when it's about font.

09:33.754 --> 09:39.158
Okay, okay, look, I promise
I will give these papers...

09:39.183 --> 09:41.493
- Mm-hmm.
- to Patty to look at later.

09:41.518 --> 09:43.556
- Well...
- Uhp.

09:43.581 --> 09:45.558
Sooner rather than later, huh?

09:46.817 --> 09:48.952
[Papers rustle]

10:04.675 --> 10:06.276
[Sighs]

10:07.161 --> 10:08.295
Who's Blair Patterson?

10:08.320 --> 10:10.248
My future husband.

10:10.587 --> 10:12.422
Just kidding. He'll barely talk to me.

10:12.447 --> 10:14.248
Oh, you got a crush. That's cute.

10:14.273 --> 10:16.291
He's the headmaster of Lucy's school.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.366
- Scandalous, right?
- Very.

10:18.391 --> 10:19.858
So you're cyberstalking.

10:19.883 --> 10:20.961
I'm not proud.

10:20.986 --> 10:22.178
Yeah, nor should you be.

10:22.203 --> 10:23.287
Especially since you're wasting time

10:23.312 --> 10:24.545
on a freaking school bio.

10:24.570 --> 10:25.703
Might as well read his résumé.

10:25.728 --> 10:28.553
- Aren't you late for work?
- Yep. Scooch.

10:33.759 --> 10:34.810
Okay.

10:34.835 --> 10:35.844
Oh.

10:35.869 --> 10:37.610
Well, he likes to sail.

10:38.468 --> 10:40.273
He sponsors REFUSE...

10:40.298 --> 10:42.833
a global strategic initiative
aimed at encouraging people

10:42.858 --> 10:44.241
to reduce their plastic footprint.

10:44.549 --> 10:46.253
Well, we're impressed.

10:46.946 --> 10:48.380
And it looks like he just checked into

10:48.405 --> 10:49.906
a yoga class on La Brea.

10:49.931 --> 10:51.402
So he's the guy who checks in

10:51.427 --> 10:53.562
and posts every single
impressive thing he's doing.

10:53.587 --> 10:55.972
Could be a major deterrent to some people.

10:55.997 --> 10:58.748
Not for me. It's very helpful.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.060
You're welcome.

11:01.134 --> 11:02.651
Thank you.

11:06.273 --> 11:08.907
A lot of the couples
I've counseled in the past

11:08.959 --> 11:11.777
seem to forget that marriage
is supposed to be fun...

11:11.811 --> 11:13.879
an adventure.

11:13.963 --> 11:16.315
Of course, that doesn't mean
challenges won't come up.

11:16.349 --> 11:17.483
Yes?

11:17.534 --> 11:20.586
My husband and I have been
married for 15 years now.

11:20.653 --> 11:23.647
Lately, we take each other for granted.

11:23.672 --> 11:26.440
We haven't really had sex like we used to.

11:26.525 --> 11:27.708
I-is there a way

11:27.793 --> 11:30.361
to make the relationship feel new again?

11:30.412 --> 11:31.629
In my experience,

11:31.663 --> 11:34.766
all contented couples
have one thing in common...

11:34.817 --> 11:37.902
they know how to make
their partner feel special.

11:37.970 --> 11:42.091
That knowledge gives them
the ability to truly connect.

11:46.745 --> 11:48.646
[Exhales shakily]

11:51.283 --> 11:52.472
Uh...

11:52.773 --> 11:57.409
An attentive partner never stops
learning about their spouse,

11:57.434 --> 12:00.002
exploring to find out who they truly are.

12:00.027 --> 12:02.128
[Exhales shakily]

12:10.185 --> 12:11.702
[Inhales deeply]

12:12.786 --> 12:15.898
Is anyone else... Feeling warm?

12:15.923 --> 12:17.056
I'm just...

12:17.081 --> 12:19.082
Sorry.

12:19.107 --> 12:21.536
[Sighs] Yay. It's you.

12:21.561 --> 12:22.945
That's a nice way to greet a person.

12:22.970 --> 12:24.437
I'm just so glad that you're not Niko.

12:24.462 --> 12:25.862
Less nice, but I'll still take it.

12:25.887 --> 12:27.820
Is Harry here? I-is he acting weird or...

12:27.845 --> 12:29.012
Harry's <i> always</i> here.

12:29.037 --> 12:30.187
As for the "acting weird" part,

12:30.212 --> 12:31.669
I wouldn't know what that looks like yet.

12:31.694 --> 12:33.375
Well, it's... it's kind of like...

12:34.110 --> 12:35.175
Constipated?

12:35.360 --> 12:36.810
Hi!

12:36.895 --> 12:38.329
- You're back.
- I am.

12:45.324 --> 12:46.354
How are you?

12:46.425 --> 12:47.471
I'm good.

12:47.505 --> 12:48.574
You didn't, like...

12:48.599 --> 12:51.451
Get some weird message from me or anything?

12:51.476 --> 12:52.843
Did you <i> leave</i> a weird message?

12:52.868 --> 12:54.002
Not on purpose.

12:54.162 --> 12:55.295
Sss...

12:55.380 --> 12:58.703
Uh, Scott called me
while I was calling you,

12:58.728 --> 13:00.920
and then I just thought that, I don't know,

13:00.945 --> 13:03.722
m-maybe the whole thing ended
up on your voice-mail, but...

13:04.052 --> 13:05.052
It did not.

13:05.077 --> 13:06.378
That is good.

13:06.741 --> 13:08.459
Why did he call you?

13:08.543 --> 13:09.953
Oh. Because...

13:09.978 --> 13:11.879
[Chuckles] Wait for it...

13:11.999 --> 13:13.418
He's getting engaged.

13:13.948 --> 13:14.972
Huh.

13:14.997 --> 13:18.395
And I have the ring, you know,
which is a family heirloom,

13:18.419 --> 13:19.503
so he just needs it back.

13:19.554 --> 13:21.596
- Okay, sure. Yeah.
- Makes sense.

13:21.676 --> 13:23.762
It... it <i> doesn't,</i>
actually, make sense.

13:23.787 --> 13:26.737
Obviously, right? Like,
he's getting engaged?

13:26.762 --> 13:28.145
Hello! It's... it's crazy.

13:28.170 --> 13:29.354
Well, I-I wouldn't know. I...

13:29.379 --> 13:30.613
You know, I don't really care.

13:30.638 --> 13:32.475
Well, I don't care, either,
but it <i> is</i> crazy, Harry.

13:32.500 --> 13:34.718
Well, he proposed to you
without hardly knowing you.

13:34.743 --> 13:36.936
Maybe he's just ready
to be married, you know?

13:37.318 --> 13:38.935
Uh... Yeah.

13:38.960 --> 13:40.905
I-I know that it happened fast with us,

13:40.930 --> 13:42.460
but, I mean, it's been three weeks.

13:42.493 --> 13:44.161
[Laughing] Like, seriously, who does that?

13:44.186 --> 13:45.686
Scott does, evidently.

13:45.847 --> 13:47.666
Should I not have told you anything?

13:47.691 --> 13:49.342
It's fine that you told me. You just...

13:49.367 --> 13:52.288
you just don't have to keep
going on and on and on about it.

13:52.313 --> 13:53.847
Well, you know, I would have texted you,

13:53.872 --> 13:55.706
but, apparently, you're
not getting my texts.

13:58.311 --> 14:00.286
Oh, Harry, come on.
Don't be mad. It's just...

14:00.311 --> 14:01.504
No, I'm not. I'm not. I'm not mad.

14:01.529 --> 14:03.814
I just... I've got to get back to work.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.990
Babe, did you do this?

14:27.849 --> 14:30.747
_

14:38.978 --> 14:41.413
Mm! Oh, thank God you're up.

14:41.497 --> 14:43.849
Okay, so, um, look, this is
what I think I'm gonna wear

14:43.874 --> 14:45.741
when I see Scott later
this afternoon, and...

14:45.766 --> 14:47.416
Right? It's nice, but
it's not <i> too</i> nice.

14:47.441 --> 14:50.176
And then this is for my
date later with Harry.

14:50.201 --> 14:51.290
Definite some earrings,

14:51.292 --> 14:52.724
I don't know, a jacket, and maybe...

14:52.792 --> 14:54.092
Do you just hate this dress?

14:54.160 --> 14:55.527
I'm not awake yet.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.369
- [Cellphone ringing]
- Oh.

14:58.175 --> 14:59.275
Oh, it's Vivian.

14:59.300 --> 15:00.984
[Gasps] It's Vivian!

15:01.009 --> 15:02.310
Have you talked to her since...

15:02.335 --> 15:03.418
No.

15:03.443 --> 15:05.544
[Ringing continues]

15:08.491 --> 15:09.541
[Ringing stops]

15:09.566 --> 15:10.950
Vivian. Hi.

15:10.975 --> 15:12.676
Hi.

15:13.555 --> 15:16.024
[Chuckles] Okay, I have
no idea what to say.

15:16.049 --> 15:17.883
I didn't plan anything beyond the "hi."

15:17.908 --> 15:19.425
I wasn't sure if you'd pick up.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.620
I didn't think you'd call.

15:21.654 --> 15:23.488
I didn't know if you'd want me to.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.624
I'm glad you did.

15:25.658 --> 15:27.192
[Sighs]

15:27.217 --> 15:30.059
I just wanted you to
know that Alec and I...

15:30.890 --> 15:32.992
We've never done anything like that before.

15:33.065 --> 15:34.932
It was a little strange, right?

15:34.957 --> 15:35.973
Yeah.

15:35.998 --> 15:37.815
Maybe more than a little.

15:38.070 --> 15:39.938
I hope it wasn't so strange

15:39.963 --> 15:42.581
that we can't be friends anymore.

15:42.742 --> 15:44.009
Not at all.

15:44.076 --> 15:45.777
I'm so relieved.

15:45.828 --> 15:47.913
Look, why don't you come
over for dinner tonight?

15:47.938 --> 15:50.373
We can talk, have a nice meal.

15:51.384 --> 15:52.450
I'd love that.

15:53.051 --> 15:54.936
Okay. Great.

15:56.355 --> 15:58.790
Joss: That sounded like it went well!

15:58.815 --> 16:00.549
[Sighs]

16:00.574 --> 16:02.892
[New age music playing]

16:07.990 --> 16:09.234
[Exhales sharply]

16:11.387 --> 16:13.838
Excuse me... why is it so hot in here?

16:13.863 --> 16:15.480
It's hot yoga.

16:15.505 --> 16:18.490
It's only 95 now, but
it'll get up to 105 later.

16:18.677 --> 16:20.628
Oh, no!

16:20.653 --> 16:22.487
Oh, no, no! Hell no.

16:23.816 --> 16:26.240
[Chuckling] Oh, my God. Blair.

16:26.265 --> 16:27.359
You go here?

16:27.384 --> 16:28.479
Three days a week.

16:28.504 --> 16:30.446
That's my mat right there.

16:53.379 --> 16:55.447
Snack time.

16:55.748 --> 16:57.181
[Chuckles]

16:57.206 --> 16:59.455
I ordered from Mozza.

16:59.480 --> 17:01.369
I'm not hungry.

17:02.252 --> 17:04.185
Sweetie, you have to eat something.

17:04.211 --> 17:06.479
I <i> am</i> eating... olives.

17:06.503 --> 17:08.172
[Chuckles]

17:10.874 --> 17:13.925
It's not good to keep
it all pent up inside.

17:17.332 --> 17:20.067
Fine. I will leave you alone,
if that's what you'd like.

17:20.247 --> 17:22.816
But, um, just know that
I'm here for you, okay?

17:22.840 --> 17:23.891
[Sighs]

17:23.958 --> 17:26.559
Why does everything have to be so hard?

17:34.570 --> 17:35.670
It doesn't.

17:36.054 --> 17:37.403
[Sighs]

17:39.357 --> 17:40.458
Wilson...

17:40.483 --> 17:41.917
I hate seeing you so sad.

17:41.942 --> 17:43.142
Okay, we... we can't.

17:43.167 --> 17:45.518
We can't do this anymore, okay?

17:45.697 --> 17:46.747
All right?

17:46.772 --> 17:50.641
L-Luca and I are... working things out.

17:50.666 --> 17:51.770
Again?

17:51.795 --> 17:53.437
Yes, again.

17:53.488 --> 17:56.006
Please don't... don't make this about you.

17:56.031 --> 17:58.837
Oh, it's not, believe me.
It's <i> never</i> about me.

17:59.711 --> 18:01.946
I just don't understand why
you let him do this to you.

18:02.013 --> 18:03.781
Because marriage is complicated.

18:03.849 --> 18:04.982
Calista, do you realize

18:05.016 --> 18:06.884
that doing the same
thing over and over again

18:06.918 --> 18:09.453
and expecting a different result
is the definition of insanity?

18:09.455 --> 18:11.889
You know what? You don't
get to speak to me that way.

18:11.914 --> 18:13.798
I've made my decision.

18:13.823 --> 18:15.357
And if you cannot support it,

18:15.382 --> 18:17.549
then you can get the hell out of my house.

18:23.403 --> 18:24.485
[Sighs]

18:25.773 --> 18:26.796
Oh!

18:26.945 --> 18:28.362
Awesome class, right?

18:29.207 --> 18:31.231
Yeah. That was great.

18:31.326 --> 18:33.811
Just the right amount of heat.

18:33.878 --> 18:35.329
[Chuckles] Here. Have some water.

18:35.447 --> 18:37.074
Okay.

18:40.190 --> 18:41.236
Mm.

18:41.419 --> 18:42.419
[Chuckles]

18:42.444 --> 18:44.288
Thirsty. Thanks.

18:44.313 --> 18:45.780
Any time.

18:45.805 --> 18:47.072
I owe you one.

18:47.097 --> 18:49.849
Or I... we could... Just skip the drink

18:49.874 --> 18:51.541
and go right to dinner, if you want.

18:52.588 --> 18:54.905
Where would we go?

18:54.930 --> 18:56.364
Anywhere.

18:56.827 --> 18:59.762
I-I could do sushi or
thai or Italian or Greek.

18:59.787 --> 19:02.039
- I love Sushi.
- Oh, what is wrong with me?

the hospital has its own agenda,

28:25.264 --> 28:27.582
but in my opinion, they just
never look out for the doctors.

28:27.607 --> 28:30.926
It is a minefield dealing
with a roomful of bureaucrats.

28:30.951 --> 28:33.076
[Scoffs] Ken's gonna be
running the department

28:33.101 --> 28:34.134
by the end of the year.

28:34.159 --> 28:36.294
Wow. How did it get so late?

28:36.319 --> 28:37.753
I should probably get going.

28:37.778 --> 28:39.328
No, Karen, don't go.

28:39.353 --> 28:40.680
Ken,<i> you</i> go.

28:40.708 --> 28:41.780
Vivian.

28:41.805 --> 28:43.360
I'm so sorry. That was rude.

28:43.444 --> 28:45.294
Ken, would you please go?

28:48.762 --> 28:51.703
Hey, buddy, I'm... So sorry.

28:51.728 --> 28:53.813
Um, I-I'll give you a call this week.

28:53.838 --> 28:56.857
- We'll get that golf game on the books.
- Sounds good. Uh...

28:56.882 --> 28:58.151
Nice to see you again, Vivian.

28:58.176 --> 29:00.193
- Nice to meet you, Karen.
- You too.

29:00.244 --> 29:02.162
I'll let myself out.

29:03.062 --> 29:05.174
[Door opens, closes]

29:05.199 --> 29:07.667
What the hell were you thinking?

29:07.702 --> 29:09.402
Karen, I'm sorry if that was presumptuous.

29:09.470 --> 29:11.738
It's just, when Vivian told me
you were coming over tonight,

29:11.822 --> 29:13.406
I thought it might be uncomfortable.

29:13.441 --> 29:17.043
And you thought blindsiding
her with some random guy...

29:17.094 --> 29:19.112
I thought a double date
was a good solution.

29:19.137 --> 29:20.604
Ken's a very nice man.

29:20.681 --> 29:23.450
He's not really my type,
but I understand the impulse.

29:23.551 --> 29:24.768
Don't let him off the hook.

29:24.793 --> 29:26.143
You did a crappy thing, Alec...

29:26.168 --> 29:28.486
just because <i> you're</i> afraid
to talk about what happened.

29:28.639 --> 29:29.889
What is there to talk about?

29:29.940 --> 29:31.694
There's a <i> lot</i> to talk about.

29:32.660 --> 29:34.105
[Sighs]

29:34.528 --> 29:36.429
I felt something the other night...

29:36.431 --> 29:40.116
something that I haven't
felt in a long time.

29:40.868 --> 29:42.402
And I know that Alec did, too.

29:42.470 --> 29:43.870
Don't put words in my mouth.

29:43.938 --> 29:46.139
Then say something!

29:48.025 --> 29:49.676
[Sighs]

29:50.761 --> 29:52.662
I felt something, too.

29:55.449 --> 29:56.816
I don't know what it means.

29:58.219 --> 30:00.987
Maybe it doesn't mean anything.

30:01.088 --> 30:03.256
Or maybe it does.

30:03.290 --> 30:06.676
Maybe there's something
here that's worth exploring.

30:06.701 --> 30:08.761
- This is ridiculous.
- It's ridiculous? Why?

30:08.812 --> 30:10.363
Why? Why, Alec? Why is it ridiculous?

30:10.447 --> 30:11.898
Because there's nothing to explore.

30:11.966 --> 30:13.099
I should go.

30:13.150 --> 30:14.200
No, please, don't.

I'm sorry.

I been on the freakin'
405 for the last two hours.

30:37.458 --> 30:39.792
I think we should see a shrink.

30:39.817 --> 30:41.512
I think we need to go to Rome.

30:41.780 --> 30:44.334
But we don't have time for
either of those things, so...

30:44.364 --> 30:46.799
Well, I think we should <i> make</i> time.

30:46.850 --> 30:50.436
Joss has a friend, Karen,
who's a psychiatrist,

30:50.504 --> 30:52.989
and I think she could refer someone.

30:53.014 --> 30:55.215
I don't need a psychiatrist, Calista.

30:55.342 --> 30:56.559
I need your support.

30:56.610 --> 30:58.077
I <i> give</i> you support.

No, you don't.

31:00.553 --> 31:02.491
the amount of pressure
I'm under every single day.

31:02.516 --> 31:03.783
We're <i> both</i> under pressure.

31:03.834 --> 31:05.634
Can you at least try and understand

31:05.659 --> 31:06.709
what it's like for me?

31:07.737 --> 31:08.937
Okay.

31:10.032 --> 31:11.691
I want to help.

31:12.839 --> 31:14.389
No, you don't.

31:14.695 --> 31:18.311
Because I ask you to do simple things,

31:20.233 --> 31:21.701
What? What have I not done?

31:21.735 --> 31:24.270
We need new models. We
got a show in New York.

31:24.304 --> 31:27.256
I sent you like 30 head shots,
you've signed off on no one.

31:27.281 --> 31:29.282
- I didn't like any of them.
- Mm-hmm.

31:29.435 --> 31:32.270
You were supposed to sign off
on the Italian fabric budget,

31:32.295 --> 31:33.646
you haven't even opened the e-mail.

31:33.697 --> 31:35.080
I <i> did</i> open the e-mail.

31:35.181 --> 31:36.582
The attachment wouldn't download.

31:36.633 --> 31:37.766
I told you that.

31:37.791 --> 31:40.009
Okay, do you see how you
have nothing but excuses?

31:40.034 --> 31:41.656
These aren't excuses. They're answers.

31:41.681 --> 31:42.863
Okay.

31:43.104 --> 31:46.948
What about the logo paperwork
I gave to you yesterday?

31:47.010 --> 31:49.228
Okay, I-I forgot to give it to Patty.

31:49.253 --> 31:50.705
Why do you got to give it to Patty?

Yeah, I think I do.

32:05.745 --> 32:08.447
Luca, it's not that I don't
listen or I don't hear you,

32:08.449 --> 32:10.324
but there are still things here...

32:10.349 --> 32:12.700
legitimate things that we need to work on.

32:12.725 --> 32:16.861
And I really think it would
help if we see a shrink.

32:18.987 --> 32:20.646
I'd rather go to Rome.

32:20.727 --> 32:21.944
No.

Come on. That's crap.

Savi's always gonna be
a part of this equation.

Pretending that she isn't
is a huge waste of time.

This is a big deal.

Well, you're not being very
proactive about the relationship.

you met with him today?

That, you did.

33:26.524 --> 33:28.169

opportunity to say something,

33:30.255 --> 33:31.472

fighting, so <i> I</i> left.

work through their feelings.

about <i> your</i> feelings?

34:31.525 --> 34:33.360
Why are theirs more important than yours?

34:33.385 --> 34:34.768
Because they're married.

34:34.793 --> 34:36.657
Yeah, and they invited
you into that marriage,

37:30.063 --> 37:31.713
You have to come with me next time.

37:31.738 --> 37:33.636
At 5:00 in the morning? No, thank you.

37:33.661 --> 37:37.481
My teacher has me focusing
on gratitude and joy.

37:37.506 --> 37:39.097
They're my two new favorite words.

37:39.122 --> 37:40.220
You're in a good mood.

37:40.245 --> 37:41.411
I am.

37:41.436 --> 37:44.054
Things are on the up-and-up
again with Luca and me, so...

37:44.079 --> 37:45.646
That explains your generosity.

37:45.671 --> 37:48.089
I got a call from Luca's
attorney this morning.

37:48.114 --> 37:51.062
You gave Luca the entire
Accessories by Luca line?

37:51.087 --> 37:52.524
No. No.

37:52.549 --> 37:56.658
I approved he can use the
logo and the font for his line,

37:56.683 --> 37:58.167
but it's all under my umbrella.

37:58.192 --> 37:59.793
No, sweetie, you signed the papers

37:59.818 --> 38:01.319
that gave him his <i> own</i> umbrella.

38:01.344 --> 38:03.135
That's why he hired his own lawyer

38:03.160 --> 38:04.327
to write up the contracts.

38:04.378 --> 38:05.461
I assumed you knew.

38:05.512 --> 38:07.697
Why else wouldn't you
have had me take a look?

38:11.235 --> 38:14.237
Okay. We've covered a lot of ground today.

38:14.271 --> 38:16.673
Does anyone have anything
else they want to share

38:16.707 --> 38:18.608
before we wrap up?

38:18.642 --> 38:20.443
Any questions?

38:20.468 --> 38:21.602
<i>I</i> have a question.

38:23.147 --> 38:26.382
I'd like to know what happens
when a marriage is broken.

38:26.433 --> 38:29.786
Say your partner gets sick... so sick

38:29.811 --> 38:33.881
that both of you are separately
preparing for the worst.

38:33.991 --> 38:36.626
But then a miracle happens.

38:36.651 --> 38:38.335
The worst doesn't come.

38:38.360 --> 38:39.893
The life is saved.

38:39.918 --> 38:41.440
But the marriage...

38:42.278 --> 38:44.896
The marriage has suffered
irreparable damage.

38:46.835 --> 38:48.569
And then something new comes along,

38:48.972 --> 38:56.045
something strange and
taboo and... unimaginable.

38:56.063 --> 38:59.465
And suddenly, it feels like
the marriage could change form.

38:59.490 --> 39:00.991
It will never be the same.

39:01.016 --> 39:02.340
But maybe...

39:04.314 --> 39:07.099
Just maybe, it could
find a new way to exist.

39:08.890 --> 39:10.774
