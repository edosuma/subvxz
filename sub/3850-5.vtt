WEBVTT

00:00.140 --> 00:01.531
I'd like to start over.

00:01.664 --> 00:03.375
I thought we just did.

00:03.633 --> 00:04.867
Lucy?

00:05.526 --> 00:07.385
<i>Previously on Mistresses... </i>

00:07.652 --> 00:09.363
I thought you were married.

00:10.567 --> 00:11.910
You're beautiful.

00:11.945 --> 00:15.308
And you are a truly good friend.

00:15.930 --> 00:17.000
Karen...

00:17.562 --> 00:18.773
Don't go.

00:19.302 --> 00:21.005
Joss and I had a fight.

00:21.030 --> 00:22.269
She was emotional

00:22.308 --> 00:24.235
and I was... kind of a jerk.

00:33.216 --> 00:35.606
I-I'm telling you. I never got your text.

00:35.631 --> 00:37.416
How many more times do
you want me to say it?

00:37.441 --> 00:39.692
No, but you can clearly
see that I sent it, right?

00:39.717 --> 00:40.850
And when a text doesn't go through,

00:40.875 --> 00:42.341
you get that little
red exclamation thingie,

00:42.366 --> 00:45.026
- which, as you can see...
- You did not.

00:45.051 --> 00:46.517
- I did not.
- Okay.

00:46.542 --> 00:47.708
You know what? I just don't understand

00:47.733 --> 00:48.900
why you didn't call me.

00:48.925 --> 00:50.459
You know I would never
ignore your text, right?

00:50.484 --> 00:52.564
- Especially an apology.
- No, I don't know that.

00:52.589 --> 00:55.291
We... we were in a fight.
And your text was cryptic.

00:55.316 --> 00:57.067
Oh, it wasn't cryptic.
I said I wanted to talk.

00:57.092 --> 00:59.727
No! No. You said we <i> should</i> talk.

00:59.772 --> 01:01.697
And then I responded, and I apologized,

01:01.722 --> 01:02.767
and you didn't respond.

01:02.792 --> 01:05.459
- Because I never got that text.
- Oh! And we're back. Okay.

01:05.912 --> 01:07.295
You could have just as easily called me

01:07.320 --> 01:08.739
when you didn't get a response, right?

01:08.764 --> 01:10.015
I figured you were still angry at me

01:10.040 --> 01:11.851
- about the whole "living together" thing.
- No.

01:11.876 --> 01:13.861
And then, we... we had a meat delivery.

01:14.066 --> 01:16.151
It's true. I can vouch for that.

01:17.866 --> 01:20.837
Uh, I-I'm not arguing the meat.
I-I don't need you to vouch.

01:21.086 --> 01:22.303
Just trying to be helpful.

01:22.412 --> 01:23.553
Thanks. We're good.

01:23.578 --> 01:25.127
Okay, let's just...

01:25.152 --> 01:26.462
[Sighs]

01:26.744 --> 01:27.972
Okay, how about this?

01:27.997 --> 01:30.019
Let's agree that texting will no longer be

01:30.044 --> 01:31.561
our primary mode of communication.

01:31.586 --> 01:32.602
Yeah, that's fine.

01:32.627 --> 01:34.364
Oh, come on, J-Joss, don't... don't start.

01:34.389 --> 01:35.557
No, I'm not starting anything.

01:35.582 --> 01:36.883
I just think it's a little bit weird

01:36.908 --> 01:38.569
that her boobs were
all up in your business.

01:38.594 --> 01:39.994
What are you talking about?

01:40.689 --> 01:42.228
Are you talking about the photo shoot?

01:42.253 --> 01:43.687
How did you know about that?

01:43.712 --> 01:44.745
I was here.

01:44.770 --> 01:46.103
- You were here?
- Mm.

01:46.128 --> 01:48.193
[Chuckles] Where? Why...
why didn't you say hello?

01:48.218 --> 01:50.025
Because you were busy and there was nudity.

01:50.050 --> 01:51.701
You should have said something.
We could have talked about it.

01:51.726 --> 01:53.244
I was actually wanting
to find you that day.

01:53.269 --> 01:55.220
No, it's... it's... you know
what? It doesn't even matter.

01:55.245 --> 01:56.736
Because I know that you're not into her,

01:56.761 --> 01:58.179
even though she's obviously into you.

01:58.204 --> 02:00.455
Oh! Come on. She is not into me.

02:00.480 --> 02:02.790
Oh, my God. Now you're just
being stupid on purpose.

02:02.815 --> 02:04.449
Okay, please at least finish one fight

02:04.474 --> 02:05.640
before we start another.

02:06.756 --> 02:07.940
[Sighs]

02:08.352 --> 02:10.687
Harry, I really... I don't
want to fight with you.

02:10.803 --> 02:12.454
Good. Me neither.

02:12.479 --> 02:13.798
Mm.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.235
I'd much rather go on a date with you...

02:16.260 --> 02:18.638
something that we still
haven't done, by the way.

02:19.156 --> 02:20.372
Oh, my God.

02:20.397 --> 02:23.056
We've never been on a date
together... like, ever.

02:23.081 --> 02:24.596
- Never. Nope.
- Like once.

02:24.621 --> 02:27.579
How about tomorrow night? I could
try to get out of here by 10:00.

02:27.604 --> 02:28.955
I could eat late.

02:29.261 --> 02:30.372
Good.

02:30.750 --> 02:31.766
Mm!

02:37.117 --> 02:38.884
[Keyboard clacking]

02:39.413 --> 02:40.630
[Knock on door]

02:40.708 --> 02:42.075
Come in. It's open.

02:43.696 --> 02:45.364
Hey.

02:45.690 --> 02:48.876
[Chuckles] I just wanted to
pop by and say thanks again

02:48.901 --> 02:51.127
for all of your help with
Lucy on the camping trip.

02:52.201 --> 02:54.101
Your advice was so dead-on.

02:54.126 --> 02:56.127
First drama-free morning
I've had in weeks.

02:56.152 --> 02:57.486
Not one slammed door. [Chuckles]

02:57.511 --> 02:58.594
That's great.

02:58.619 --> 03:01.054
She didn't even resist
having her iPhone taken away.

03:01.079 --> 03:02.295
Talk about a miracle.

03:02.320 --> 03:03.420
[Chuckles]

03:03.445 --> 03:05.897
Boundaries and structure
equals respect, right?

03:05.922 --> 03:07.232
That's right.

03:08.993 --> 03:10.494
[Scribbling]

03:11.783 --> 03:14.398
Oh! And my ankle's all better, too.

03:14.423 --> 03:15.590
See? [Chuckles]

03:15.615 --> 03:16.731
[Chuckles]

03:16.756 --> 03:18.160
[Telephone rings] Glad to hear it, April.

03:19.484 --> 03:20.835
Was there anything else?

03:21.029 --> 03:22.546
No.

03:22.571 --> 03:23.965
No.

03:23.990 --> 03:25.991
This is Headmaster Patterson.

03:26.016 --> 03:27.789
Bill. Thanks for returning.

03:29.137 --> 03:30.971
Yes, absolutely, yes.

03:31.189 --> 03:33.007
Yes, absolutely.

Sync and corrections by Albanda

03:37.999 --> 03:41.695
I literally did a hair toss
I haven't done since I was 16,

03:41.720 --> 03:43.054
and he barely looked up.

03:43.079 --> 03:45.130
I thought we had a moment
on that camping trip,

03:45.155 --> 03:46.477
but I guess I was wrong.

03:46.564 --> 03:48.431
Although, maybe he was just busy.

03:48.657 --> 03:51.158
I had sex with Alec and Vivian.

03:51.209 --> 03:52.826
[Crash]

03:52.851 --> 03:54.649
Sorry we're late!

03:55.105 --> 03:58.892
You guys, this is the
fabulous Calista Raines

03:58.917 --> 04:01.135
that I've been talking
about literally nonstop.

04:01.160 --> 04:03.912
Calista, this is April.
And you already know Karen.

04:03.937 --> 04:06.355
Yes, the brilliant and
beautiful psychiatrist

04:06.380 --> 04:08.764
who fearlessly searches for love and truth.

04:08.789 --> 04:10.072
Mm. It's a pleasure.

04:10.097 --> 04:12.899
And you, April... more
gorgeous than Joss described.

04:12.924 --> 04:15.875
And your place... I'm dying,
I'm dead, I'm in heaven.

04:15.900 --> 04:19.019
- I want everything.
- [Laughter]

04:19.153 --> 04:21.219
Oh, why is there tuna fish on the floor?

04:21.244 --> 04:22.970
Uh, it's chicken salad.

04:24.359 --> 04:26.403
What's... Going on?

04:27.829 --> 04:30.497
I... was just telling Karen

04:30.522 --> 04:33.106
about this guy I met at Lucy's school.

04:33.131 --> 04:34.465
I thought we had a connection,

04:34.490 --> 04:36.751
so I went over to his office
and flirted my little butt off,

04:36.788 --> 04:38.088
waiting for him to ask me out.

04:38.206 --> 04:39.673
And, uh... Nothing.

04:39.698 --> 04:40.898
Why don't you ask <i> him</i> out?

04:41.042 --> 04:42.592
Oh, 'cause that's just...

04:42.617 --> 04:44.654
[Laughing] I mean, that's
a little too forward for me.

04:44.679 --> 04:46.935
Yeah, no, no, April's
literally never asked a man out

04:46.960 --> 04:48.048
in her entire life.

04:48.073 --> 04:50.325
That may be true, but you
don't get anything in this life

04:50.350 --> 04:52.851
without going after what you want.

04:52.876 --> 04:53.909
You didn't wait around

04:53.934 --> 04:55.901
for someone to offer
you this fabulous store.

04:55.926 --> 04:58.392
I'm sure you had to fight
tooth and nail to have it.

04:58.417 --> 04:59.501
That's true. I did.

04:59.526 --> 05:00.993
Hmm.

05:01.279 --> 05:03.897
What about you, silent beauty?

05:03.922 --> 05:06.057
My life's pretty boring lately.

05:06.082 --> 05:07.415
It's just...

05:07.440 --> 05:09.808
and, unfortunately, I'm late
for an appointment, so...

05:09.833 --> 05:12.108
What?! You can't leave now!

05:13.045 --> 05:14.882
Okay, what's going on?

05:15.635 --> 05:16.967
Nothing.

05:16.992 --> 05:19.543
Karen slept with a
married couple last night.

05:20.581 --> 05:22.082
- April.
- I'm sorry!

05:22.133 --> 05:24.444
But she seems very
wise. Maybe she can help.

05:24.469 --> 05:27.146
Absolutely. I love a good mÃ©nage.

05:27.171 --> 05:29.518
Oh, me too! Me too! Me too!
Okay, so, who was the couple?

05:29.543 --> 05:30.900
Did you meet them online?

05:30.925 --> 05:32.475
It was the doctor and his wife!

05:32.500 --> 05:34.294
- What?!
- O-o-o-okay, okay, okay.

05:34.319 --> 05:35.903
You're officially forbidden to speak.

05:35.928 --> 05:37.981
Oh, my God! I told you he
wanted to sleep with you.

05:38.006 --> 05:40.248
- I knew it!
- Congratulations. You were right.

05:40.273 --> 05:42.128
Hey, at least you included the wife, right?

05:42.153 --> 05:44.662
- That was big of you.
- See, it's... Not like that.

05:44.687 --> 05:46.271
You <i> wanted</i> to have sex with her?

05:46.296 --> 05:48.714
I didn't think so, but
while it was happening...

05:51.307 --> 05:52.639
It's complicated.

05:52.664 --> 05:55.560
Yeah. Threesomes normally are.

05:55.585 --> 05:57.887
So... so, what happened after
you guys all slept together?

05:57.912 --> 06:00.496
I snuck out of the house
before they woke up.

06:01.187 --> 06:04.406
I can't imagine I'll ever
speak to either of them again.

06:05.793 --> 06:07.627
Is that what you want?

06:11.152 --> 06:13.836
As much as I'd love to
continue this conversation,

06:13.861 --> 06:15.710
I'm late to meet a priest.

06:15.735 --> 06:18.135
So nice to meet you again, Calista.

06:18.512 --> 06:19.778
Bye.

06:20.816 --> 06:23.183
That chicken salad... does that have nuts?

06:49.517 --> 06:51.566
Uh, no, not at all. W-what's up?

06:51.797 --> 06:53.465
Uh, I don't know how to say this

06:53.490 --> 06:55.791
without actually just sort
of, you know, saying it.

06:55.918 --> 06:57.375
I need the ring back.

06:57.696 --> 06:59.096
Oh. Of course.

06:59.344 --> 07:01.425
I-I've been meaning to call you about that.

07:01.523 --> 07:03.669
Yeah, a-a-and normally, I wouldn't bother,

07:03.694 --> 07:05.445
but I-I need it <i> now.</i>

[Gasps]

07:39.374 --> 07:41.108
I can't tell you how happy I am to have

07:41.143 --> 07:43.244
such an esteemed professional
from my congregation

07:43.269 --> 07:45.022
willing to lead our married-couples class.

07:45.047 --> 07:46.380
I'm glad I can help.

07:46.382 --> 07:47.982
Now, one of my major concerns

07:47.984 --> 07:50.768
is keeping the married couples
in our congregation together.

07:50.819 --> 07:52.520
I counsel them <i>before</i>
they get married,

07:52.587 --> 07:54.919
but afterwards, there's just no time,

07:54.944 --> 07:56.373
with everything they're going through.

07:56.398 --> 07:59.067
Seems couples are
splitting up right and left.

07:59.092 --> 08:01.043
And we know how God feels about divorce.

08:01.079 --> 08:03.663
- Not a fan.
- [Chuckles]

08:03.688 --> 08:05.332
I'm guessing they'll probably open up more

08:05.357 --> 08:07.491
to a... a professional
like you leading the group.

08:07.565 --> 08:08.683
Just to be clear,

08:08.708 --> 08:10.675
I don't counsel professionally anymore.

08:10.988 --> 08:13.489
Perfect, because we
can't afford to pay you.

08:13.514 --> 08:14.781

08:17.317 --> 08:20.319

minutes to kill before class.

08:38.299 --> 08:39.482
- Where you been?
- Brunching.

08:39.508 --> 08:42.543
With some fabulous new
girlfriends of mine...

08:42.568 --> 08:44.636
one of them snap-dab in the middle

08:44.661 --> 08:46.569
of a juicy threesome.

08:47.025 --> 08:50.461
You know, it reminded me of the time

08:50.486 --> 08:52.970
you and I hooked up on that flight to Rio

08:52.995 --> 08:55.003
and the stewardess caught us,

08:55.028 --> 08:56.701
and she asked if she can join in.

08:56.726 --> 08:57.837
- Mm.
- Uh-huh.

08:57.862 --> 08:59.393
Someone had a glass of wine.

08:59.418 --> 09:00.797
Someone had <i> two.</i>

09:00.832 --> 09:02.801
Listen, I have a meeting in an hour,

09:02.826 --> 09:04.878
but I could push it
back if I found something

09:04.903 --> 09:07.387
that, uh... distracts me.

09:07.412 --> 09:10.848
Oh, I would love to,
darling, but I am buried.

09:10.873 --> 09:12.929
You know what would be really helpful...

09:12.954 --> 09:16.066
if you signed these papers I
left out for you this morning,

09:16.091 --> 09:18.059
because you know how insane it makes me

09:18.084 --> 09:19.585
when I have to ask you twice.

09:19.610 --> 09:21.244
What... what... what are these?

09:21.269 --> 09:22.952
- Really?
- [Chuckles]

09:22.977 --> 09:25.612
Come on, this is the
approval for my accessory line

09:25.637 --> 09:27.889
to use the font and logo
of the Calista Raines line.

09:28.225 --> 09:30.336
Do you <i> ever</i> listen
when I talk to you about work?

09:30.361 --> 09:33.694
I listen to you... just
not when it's about font.

09:33.754 --> 09:39.158
Okay, okay, look, I promise
I will give these papers...

09:39.183 --> 09:41.493
- Mm-hmm.
- to Patty to look at later.

09:41.518 --> 09:43.556
- Well...
- Uhp.

09:43.581 --> 09:45.558
Sooner rather than later, huh?

09:46.817 --> 09:48.952
[Papers rustle]

10:04.675 --> 10:06.276
[Sighs]

10:07.161 --> 10:08.295
Who's Blair Patterson?

10:08.320 --> 10:10.248
My future husband.

10:10.587 --> 10:12.422
Just kidding. He'll barely talk to me.

10:12.447 --> 10:14.248
Oh, you got a crush. That's cute.

10:14.273 --> 10:16.291
He's the headmaster of Lucy's school.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.366
- Scandalous, right?
- Very.

10:18.391 --> 10:19.858
So you're cyberstalking.

10:19.883 --> 10:20.961
I'm not proud.

10:20.986 --> 10:22.178
Yeah, nor should you be.

10:22.203 --> 10:23.287
Especially since you're wasting time

10:23.312 --> 10:24.545
on a freaking school bio.

10:24.570 --> 10:25.703
Might as well read his rÃ©sumÃ©.

10:25.728 --> 10:28.553
- Aren't you late for work?
- Yep. Scooch.

10:33.759 --> 10:34.810
Okay.

10:34.835 --> 10:35.844
Oh.

10:35.869 --> 10:37.610
Well, he likes to sail.

10:38.468 --> 10:40.273
He sponsors REFUSE...

10:40.298 --> 10:42.833
a global strategic initiative
aimed at encouraging people

10:42.858 --> 10:44.241
to reduce their plastic footprint.

10:44.549 --> 10:46.253
Well, we're impressed.

10:46.946 --> 10:48.380
And it looks like he just checked into

10:48.405 --> 10:49.906
a yoga class on La Brea.

10:49.931 --> 10:51.402
So he's the guy who checks in

10:51.427 --> 10:53.562
and posts every single
impressive thing he's doing.

10:53.587 --> 10:55.972
Could be a major deterrent to some people.

10:55.997 --> 10:58.748
Not for me. It's very helpful.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.060
You're welcome.

11:01.134 --> 11:02.651
Thank you.

11:06.273 --> 11:08.907
A lot of the couples
I've counseled in the past

11:08.959 --> 11:11.777
seem to forget that marriage
is supposed to be fun...

11:11.811 --> 11:13.879
an adventure.

11:13.963 --> 11:16.315
Of course, that doesn't mean
challenges won't come up.

11:16.349 --> 11:17.483
Yes?

11:17.534 --> 11:20.586
My husband and I have been
married for 15 years now.

11:20.653 --> 11:23.647
Lately, we take each other for granted.

11:23.672 --> 11:26.440
We haven't really had sex like we used to.

11:26.525 --> 11:27.708
I-is there a way

11:27.793 --> 11:30.361
to make the relationship feel new again?

11:30.412 --> 11:31.629
In my experience,

11:31.663 --> 11:34.766
all contented couples
have one thing in common...

11:34.817 --> 11:37.902
they know how to make
their partner feel special.

11:37.970 --> 11:42.091
That knowledge gives them
the ability to truly connect.

11:46.745 --> 11:48.646
[Exhales shakily]

11:51.283 --> 11:52.472
Uh...

11:52.773 --> 11:57.409
An attentive partner never stops
learning about their spouse,

11:57.434 --> 12:00.002
exploring to find out who they truly are.

12:00.027 --> 12:02.128
[Exhales shakily]

12:10.185 --> 12:11.702
[Inhales deeply]

12:12.786 --> 12:15.898
Is anyone else... Feeling warm?

12:15.923 --> 12:17.056
I'm just...

12:17.081 --> 12:19.082
Sorry.

12:19.107 --> 12:21.536
[Sighs] Yay. It's you.

12:21.561 --> 12:22.945
That's a nice way to greet a person.

12:22.970 --> 12:24.437
I'm just so glad that you're not Niko.

12:24.462 --> 12:25.862
Less nice, but I'll still take it.

12:25.887 --> 12:27.820
Is Harry here? I-is he acting weird or...

12:27.845 --> 12:29.012
Harry's <i> always</i> here.

12:29.037 --> 12:30.187
As for the "acting weird" part,

12:30.212 --> 12:31.669
I wouldn't know what that looks like yet.

12:31.694 --> 12:33.375
Well, it's... it's kind of like...

12:34.110 --> 12:35.175
Constipated?

12:35.360 --> 12:36.810
Hi!

12:36.895 --> 12:38.329
- You're back.
- I am.

12:45.324 --> 12:46.354
How are you?

12:46.425 --> 12:47.471
I'm good.

12:47.505 --> 12:48.574
You didn't, like...

12:48.599 --> 12:51.451
Get some weird message from me or anything?

12:51.476 --> 12:52.843
Did you <i> leave</i> a weird message?

12:52.868 --> 12:54.002
Not on purpose.

12:54.162 --> 12:55.295
Sss...

12:55.380 --> 12:58.703
Uh, Scott called me
while I was calling you,

12:58.728 --> 13:00.920
and then I just thought that, I don't know,

13:00.945 --> 13:03.722
m-maybe the whole thing ended
up on your voice-mail, but...

13:04.052 --> 13:05.052
It did not.

13:05.077 --> 13:06.378
That is good.

13:06.741 --> 13:08.459
Why did he call you?

13:08.543 --> 13:09.953
Oh. Because...

13:09.978 --> 13:11.879
[Chuckles] Wait for it...

13:11.999 --> 13:13.418
He's getting engaged.

13:13.948 --> 13:14.972
Huh.

13:14.997 --> 13:18.395
And I have the ring, you know,
which is a family heirloom,

13:18.419 --> 13:19.503
so he just needs it back.

13:19.554 --> 13:21.596
- Okay, sure. Yeah.
- Makes sense.

13:21.676 --> 13:23.762
It... it <i> doesn't,</i>
actually, make sense.

13:23.787 --> 13:26.737
Obviously, right? Like,
he's getting engaged?

13:26.762 --> 13:28.145
Hello! It's... it's crazy.

13:28.170 --> 13:29.354
Well, I-I wouldn't know. I...

13:29.379 --> 13:30.613
You know, I don't really care.

13:30.638 --> 13:32.475
Well, I don't care, either,
but it <i> is</i> crazy, Harry.

13:32.500 --> 13:34.718
Well, he proposed to you
without hardly knowing you.

13:34.743 --> 13:36.936
Maybe he's just ready
to be married, you know?

13:37.318 --> 13:38.935
Uh... Yeah.

13:38.960 --> 13:40.905
I-I know that it happened fast with us,

13:40.930 --> 13:42.460
but, I mean, it's been three weeks.

13:42.493 --> 13:44.161
[Laughing] Like, seriously, who does that?

13:44.186 --> 13:45.686
Scott does, evidently.

13:45.847 --> 13:47.666
Should I not have told you anything?

13:47.691 --> 13:49.342
It's fine that you told me. You just...

13:49.367 --> 13:52.288
you just don't have to keep
going on and on and on about it.

13:52.313 --> 13:53.847
Well, you know, I would have texted you,

13:53.872 --> 13:55.706
but, apparently, you're
not getting my texts.

13:58.311 --> 14:00.286
Oh, Harry, come on.
Don't be mad. It's just...

14:00.311 --> 14:01.504
No, I'm not. I'm not. I'm not mad.

14:01.529 --> 14:03.814
I just... I've got to get back to work.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.990
Babe, did you do this?

14:27.849 --> 14:30.747
_

14:38.978 --> 14:41.413
Mm! Oh, thank God you're up.

14:41.497 --> 14:43.849
Okay, so, um, look, this is
what I think I'm gonna wear

14:43.874 --> 14:45.741
when I see Scott later
this afternoon, and...

14:45.766 --> 14:47.416
Right? It's nice, but
it's not <i> too</i> nice.

14:47.441 --> 14:50.176
And then this is for my
date later with Harry.

14:50.201 --> 14:51.290
Definite some earrings,

14:51.292 --> 14:52.724
I don't know, a jacket, and maybe...

14:52.792 --> 14:54.092
Do you just hate this dress?

14:54.160 --> 14:55.527
I'm not awake yet.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.369
- [Cellphone ringing]
- Oh.

14:58.175 --> 14:59.275
Oh, it's Vivian.

14:59.300 --> 15:00.984
[Gasps] It's Vivian!

15:01.009 --> 15:02.310
Have you talked to her since...

15:02.335 --> 15:03.418
No.

15:03.443 --> 15:05.544
[Ringing continues]

15:08.491 --> 15:09.541
[Ringing stops]

15:09.566 --> 15:10.950
Vivian. Hi.

15:10.975 --> 15:12.676
Hi.

15:13.555 --> 15:16.024
[Chuckles] Okay, I have
no idea what to say.

15:16.049 --> 15:17.883
I didn't plan anything beyond the "hi."

15:17.908 --> 15:19.425
I wasn't sure if you'd pick up.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.620
I didn't think you'd call.

15:21.654 --> 15:23.488
I didn't know if you'd want me to.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.624
I'm glad you did.

15:25.658 --> 15:27.192
[Sighs]

15:27.217 --> 15:30.059
I just wanted you to
know that Alec and I...

15:30.890 --> 15:32.992
We've never done anything like that before.

15:33.065 --> 15:34.932
It was a little strange, right?

15:34.957 --> 15:35.973
Yeah.

15:35.998 --> 15:37.815
Maybe more than a little.

15:38.070 --> 15:39.938
I hope it wasn't so strange

15:39.963 --> 15:42.581
that we can't be friends anymore.

15:42.742 --> 15:44.009
Not at all.

15:44.076 --> 15:45.777
I'm so relieved.

15:45.828 --> 15:47.913
Look, why don't you come
over for dinner tonight?

15:47.938 --> 15:50.373
We can talk, have a nice meal.

15:51.384 --> 15:52.450
I'd love that.

15:53.051 --> 15:54.936
Okay. Great.

15:56.355 --> 15:58.790
Joss: That sounded like it went well!

15:58.815 --> 16:00.549
[Sighs]

16:00.574 --> 16:02.892
[New age music playing]

16:07.990 --> 16:09.234
[Exhales sharply]

16:11.387 --> 16:13.838
Excuse me... why is it so hot in here?

16:13.863 --> 16:15.480
It's hot yoga.

16:15.505 --> 16:18.490
It's only 95 now, but
it'll get up to 105 later.

16:18.677 --> 16:20.628
Oh, no!

16:20.653 --> 16:22.487
Oh, no, no! Hell no.

16:23.816 --> 16:26.240
[Chuckling] Oh, my God. Blair.

16:26.265 --> 16:27.359
You go here?

16:27.384 --> 16:28.479
Three days a week.

16:28.504 --> 16:30.446
That's my mat right there.

16:53.379 --> 16:55.447
Snack time.

16:55.748 --> 16:57.181
[Chuckles]

16:57.206 --> 16:59.455
I ordered from Mozza.

16:59.480 --> 17:01.369
I'm not hungry.

17:02.252 --> 17:04.185
Sweetie, you have to eat something.

17:04.211 --> 17:06.479
I <i> am</i> eating... olives.

17:06.503 --> 17:08.172
[Chuckles]

17:10.874 --> 17:13.925
It's not good to keep
it all pent up inside.

17:17.332 --> 17:20.067
Fine. I will leave you alone,
if that's what you'd like.

17:20.247 --> 17:22.816
But, um, just know that
I'm here for you, okay?

17:22.840 --> 17:23.891
[Sighs]

17:23.958 --> 17:26.559
Why does everything have to be so hard?

17:34.570 --> 17:35.670
It doesn't.

17:36.054 --> 17:37.403
[Sighs]

17:39.357 --> 17:40.458
Wilson...

17:40.483 --> 17:41.917
I hate seeing you so sad.

17:41.942 --> 17:43.142
Okay, we... we can't.

17:43.167 --> 17:45.518
We can't do this anymore, okay?

17:45.697 --> 17:46.747
All right?

17:46.772 --> 17:50.641
L-Luca and I are... working things out.

17:50.666 --> 17:51.770
Again?

17:51.795 --> 17:53.437
Yes, again.

17:53.488 --> 17:56.006
Please don't... don't make this about you.

17:56.031 --> 17:58.837
Oh, it's not, believe me.
It's <i> never</i> about me.

17:59.711 --> 18:01.946
I just don't understand why
you let him do this to you.

18:02.013 --> 18:03.781
Because marriage is complicated.

18:03.849 --> 18:04.982
Calista, do you realize

18:05.016 --> 18:06.884
that doing the same
thing over and over again

18:06.918 --> 18:09.453
and expecting a different result
is the definition of insanity?

18:09.455 --> 18:11.889
You know what? You don't
get to speak to me that way.

18:11.914 --> 18:13.798
I've made my decision.

18:13.823 --> 18:15.357
And if you cannot support it,

18:15.382 --> 18:17.549
then you can get the hell out of my house.

18:23.403 --> 18:24.485
[Sighs]

18:25.773 --> 18:26.796
Oh!

18:26.945 --> 18:28.362
Awesome class, right?

18:29.207 --> 18:31.231
Yeah. That was great.

18:31.326 --> 18:33.811
Just the right amount of heat.

18:33.878 --> 18:35.329
[Chuckles] Here. Have some water.

18:35.447 --> 18:37.074
Okay.

18:40.190 --> 18:41.236
Mm.

18:41.419 --> 18:42.419
[Chuckles]

18:42.444 --> 18:44.288
Thirsty. Thanks.

18:44.313 --> 18:45.780
Any time.

18:45.805 --> 18:47.072
I owe you one.

18:47.097 --> 18:49.849
Or I... we could... Just skip the drink

18:49.874 --> 18:51.541
and go right to dinner, if you want.

18:52.588 --> 18:54.905
Where would we go?

18:54.930 --> 18:56.364
Anywhere.

18:56.827 --> 18:59.762
I-I could do sushi or
thai or Italian or Greek.

18:59.787 --> 19:02.039
- I love Sushi.
- Oh, what is wrong with me?

19:02.064 --> 19:03.765
Wait. We can go to Wunderbar.

19:03.790 --> 19:05.891
The chef is a personal friend of mine.

19:05.916 --> 19:08.267
Really? I heard tables are
really tough to get there.

19:08.292 --> 19:11.144
Trust me, not a problem.
I can get us in anytime.

19:11.476 --> 19:12.876
How about tonight?

19:13.618 --> 19:14.885
That sounds great.

19:16.842 --> 19:18.393
It's a date, then.

19:19.791 --> 19:21.224
Instructor: Well done, honey.

19:21.292 --> 19:23.727
Seven have tried, seven have failed.

19:23.778 --> 19:26.430
I'd make a quick exit,
though, if I were you.

- Hi.

So, um...

19:59.597 --> 20:01.031
This is April's shop, huh?

20:01.056 --> 20:02.223
Yeah. [Chuckles]

20:02.537 --> 20:04.253
I never... I never brought you here?

20:04.278 --> 20:05.342
No.

20:05.542 --> 20:07.008
Strange.

20:08.919 --> 20:10.564
So, do you... do you have the ring, or...

20:10.589 --> 20:12.502
Oh. Uh, of course.

20:13.001 --> 20:14.419
Here it is.

20:14.471 --> 20:15.720
Thanks.

20:17.154 --> 20:19.723
So, I guess congratulations, right?

20:19.748 --> 20:23.913
I know, um, this probably seems
pretty strange from the outside.

20:23.938 --> 20:26.256
It's not as weird as
it... as it seems, really.

20:26.281 --> 20:28.383
Um, do you remember my ex-girlfriend Jen?

20:28.408 --> 20:29.574
Jen Feldman?

20:29.599 --> 20:31.337
What, the one that you
dated all through med school?

20:31.362 --> 20:32.479
That's the one.

20:32.530 --> 20:34.173
Well, she... she found out
that grandma June had died.

20:34.198 --> 20:35.465
She reached out.

20:35.499 --> 20:38.201
We just sort of picked things
up where we left off, you know?

20:38.285 --> 20:40.470
It sort of felt like it was meant to be.

20:40.554 --> 20:41.971
Wow.

20:41.996 --> 20:43.263
Well...

20:43.288 --> 20:44.688
Your mom must be really happy.

20:44.875 --> 20:46.423
Yeah, she is.

20:46.448 --> 20:47.782
[Sighs]

20:47.940 --> 20:50.158
It's just... I thought that...

20:50.183 --> 20:52.351
Oh. Never mind. It's none of my business.

20:52.376 --> 20:54.810
No, I-it's not. But go
ahead, say it anyway. What?

20:54.916 --> 20:57.005
I just... I thought
that you didn't love her.

20:57.030 --> 20:58.247
Isn't that why you broke up?

20:58.355 --> 21:00.972
Yeah, I-I didn't love her then. I do now.

21:00.997 --> 21:02.197
I've changed a lot.

21:02.559 --> 21:03.943
You know, things change.

21:03.968 --> 21:05.101
Right.

21:07.331 --> 21:08.331
Scott.

21:09.700 --> 21:11.751
I'm so sorry.

21:11.869 --> 21:13.803
I really never meant to hurt you.

21:13.904 --> 21:16.756
I never in my wildest
dreams thought that I could.

21:16.874 --> 21:19.282
And I know that... I know
that it doesn't matter.

21:19.307 --> 21:22.116
I know that nothing I could
possibly say right now...

21:22.262 --> 21:24.791
[Sighs] Matters to you, but...

21:24.874 --> 21:26.552
[Sighs]

21:27.017 --> 21:30.261
I just wanted you to know
that what we had was real.

21:30.653 --> 21:32.020
It was.

21:37.969 --> 21:39.470
I hope he's worth it.

21:39.863 --> 21:45.953
âª Oh, my heart âª

21:58.577 --> 22:01.065
[Sizzle] Damn it! Mm!

22:01.090 --> 22:02.984
- You okay?
- Fine, yeah.

22:03.019 --> 22:04.886
I just didn't know how hot it was.

22:04.921 --> 22:07.205
Well, be careful. Oven
mitt's in the top drawer.

22:07.256 --> 22:08.890
And I want Lucy in bed by 10:00.

22:08.958 --> 22:11.224
No TV, no iPhone. She's got homework.

22:11.249 --> 22:13.214
I told her to show it to
you before she goes to bed.

22:13.239 --> 22:15.290
Uh, yeah. So, how late will you be tonight?

22:15.315 --> 22:17.631
Just so I can, you know,
manage Lucy's expectations.

22:17.656 --> 22:20.135
Is this dinner and
dancing or a movie and...

22:20.160 --> 22:22.719
- [Clicks tongue]
- Just dinner... as far as I know.

22:22.744 --> 22:25.363
But Lucy should be asleep
by the time I get home.

22:26.282 --> 22:27.449
[Sighs]

22:27.474 --> 22:28.574
If you were a guy,

22:28.599 --> 22:31.150
would this be an appropriate
outfit for a first date?

22:31.175 --> 22:33.794
I <i> am</i> a guy, April.

22:33.819 --> 22:34.902
[Laughs] Right.

22:34.927 --> 22:36.577
I mean, if you were a man

22:36.602 --> 22:38.654
who happened to be headmaster
of a private school.

22:38.679 --> 22:40.997
I would be very pleased.

22:41.022 --> 22:42.672
Aw, that's sweet. Thank you.

22:42.697 --> 22:44.331
And thanks again for watching the kids.

22:44.356 --> 22:45.707
Are you sure you're gonna be okay?

22:45.732 --> 22:47.675
You're not gonna burn the
house down or anything?

22:47.700 --> 22:48.883
I wasn't planning on it.

22:48.908 --> 22:50.688
You can relax. Have fun tonight.

22:51.660 --> 22:54.126
You really like him, huh?

22:54.425 --> 22:55.926
Yeah.

22:55.951 --> 22:57.168
I guess I do.

22:57.193 --> 22:58.226
Bye.

22:58.251 --> 22:59.317
All right.

23:05.831 --> 23:06.831
[Door closes]

23:08.443 --> 23:10.377
Oh, God. And the look in his eyes.

23:10.428 --> 23:13.364
Oh, my God, Karen, it was heartbreaking.

23:13.389 --> 23:15.139
I-I... you know, I wanted to say more,

23:15.164 --> 23:16.598
but what... what could I say?

23:16.623 --> 23:18.691
Are you saying you made
a mistake choosing Harry?

23:18.716 --> 23:20.533
No! No, no, no. Not at all.

23:20.558 --> 23:24.038
I'm just saying that, you know,
Scott's such an awesome guy.

23:24.063 --> 23:25.863
I don't know what the hell's
going on with Harry lately.

23:25.888 --> 23:27.071
What do you mean, you don't know?

23:27.096 --> 23:29.322
Everything's just a friggin'
battle with him, you know?

23:29.347 --> 23:31.582
No matter what I say, he says the opposite.

23:31.607 --> 23:33.426
With Scott, we made decisions so easily.

23:33.451 --> 23:35.815
Everything was easy. It
just flowed like a river.

23:36.191 --> 23:37.921
Seriously? Like a river?

23:37.956 --> 23:39.306
You cheated on him, remember?

23:39.390 --> 23:40.591
Not while we were together.

23:40.675 --> 23:42.626
Technically, it was the
cheating that ended it.

23:42.660 --> 23:43.927
Just...

23:43.962 --> 23:45.438
Scott always knew what he wanted.

23:45.463 --> 23:46.647
It was part of his appeal.

23:46.698 --> 23:48.966
With Harry, everything
is one big hesitation.

23:49.033 --> 23:50.801
Like, the "living together" thing.

23:50.852 --> 23:52.569
You know, like, what's holding him back?

23:52.654 --> 23:54.888
- I want to know.
- So ask him.

23:54.973 --> 23:57.024
I plan to, believe me.

23:57.389 --> 23:59.707
Okay. How do I look?

24:00.213 --> 24:01.702
Amish.

24:01.926 --> 24:04.657
[Chuckling] No, this is the
perfectly appropriate thing

24:04.682 --> 24:06.850
to wear to dinner with a
couple you just had sex with.

24:06.918 --> 24:09.086
Is it weird I'm going over there?

24:09.111 --> 24:10.444
It depends.

24:10.469 --> 24:12.166
Are you gonna pretend
that nothing happened?

24:12.191 --> 24:13.369
I don't know.

24:13.394 --> 24:15.025
I'm just gonna follow their lead.

24:15.059 --> 24:17.160
Well, you know what Calista says...

24:17.185 --> 24:18.935
you should ask for what you want.

24:18.960 --> 24:21.239
Calista's <i> your</i> friend, nof mine.

24:23.534 --> 24:24.629
[Sighs]

24:25.984 --> 24:28.302
So, when I told Harry I was
bringing you here to dinner,

24:28.327 --> 24:30.261
he started asking me
all of these questions,

24:30.286 --> 24:32.604
and I realized I only
knew, like, three things...

24:32.629 --> 24:34.646
headmaster, hot yoga, loves sushi.

24:34.671 --> 24:37.077
So Harry insisted on
creating a special sushi menu

24:37.102 --> 24:38.212
just for us.

24:38.237 --> 24:39.837
You really didn't have
to go to so much trouble.

24:39.862 --> 24:42.328
Are you kidding? After
you went so out of your way

24:42.353 --> 24:43.954
to be so sweet to me and Lucy?

24:43.979 --> 24:45.146
Plus, I love sushi, too.

24:45.171 --> 24:46.805
I mean, the rules, the rituals,

24:46.830 --> 24:48.700
the beauty of the presentation.

24:48.725 --> 24:50.693
Did you know that when you're
not using your chopsticks,

24:50.718 --> 24:52.101
you should place them in front of you,

24:52.126 --> 24:53.476
parallel to the edge of the sushi bar

24:53.501 --> 24:55.502
with the narrow end in the hashi oki?

24:55.527 --> 24:58.079
That's what this cute little
thing is called... hashi oki.

24:58.104 --> 24:59.141
I googled it.

24:59.166 --> 25:00.804
I never knew that.

25:00.829 --> 25:02.714
Well, now you do.

25:03.178 --> 25:06.296
And how are you two doing
back in the corner here?

25:06.321 --> 25:09.217
I hope you know that we, uh,
we save this table for V.I.P.s.

25:09.267 --> 25:10.301
We love it, Harry.

25:10.352 --> 25:12.203
And Blair has been raving about your food.

25:12.254 --> 25:14.071
Incredible. Truly as
good as any I've ever had.

25:14.139 --> 25:16.023

I hope you like round 2.

28:23.889 --> 28:25.239
the hospital has its own agenda,

28:25.264 --> 28:27.582
but in my opinion, they just
never look out for the doctors.

28:27.607 --> 28:30.926
It is a minefield dealing
with a roomful of bureaucrats.

28:30.951 --> 28:33.076
[Scoffs] Ken's gonna be
running the department

28:33.101 --> 28:34.134
by the end of the year.

28:34.159 --> 28:36.294
Wow. How did it get so late?

28:36.319 --> 28:37.753
I should probably get going.

28:37.778 --> 28:39.328
No, Karen, don't go.

28:39.353 --> 28:40.680
Ken,<i> you</i> go.

28:40.708 --> 28:41.780
Vivian.

28:41.805 --> 28:43.360
I'm so sorry. That was rude.

28:43.444 --> 28:45.294
Ken, would you please go?

28:48.762 --> 28:51.703
Hey, buddy, I'm... So sorry.

28:51.728 --> 28:53.813
Um, I-I'll give you a call this week.

28:53.838 --> 28:56.857
- We'll get that golf game on the books.
- Sounds good. Uh...

28:56.882 --> 28:58.151
Nice to see you again, Vivian.

28:58.176 --> 29:00.193
- Nice to meet you, Karen.
- You too.

29:00.244 --> 29:02.162
I'll let myself out.

29:03.062 --> 29:05.174
[Door opens, closes]

29:05.199 --> 29:07.667
What the hell were you thinking?

29:07.702 --> 29:09.402
Karen, I'm sorry if that was presumptuous.

29:09.470 --> 29:11.738
It's just, when Vivian told me
you were coming over tonight,

29:11.822 --> 29:13.406
I thought it might be uncomfortable.

29:13.441 --> 29:17.043
And you thought blindsiding
her with some random guy...

29:17.094 --> 29:19.112
I thought a double date
was a good solution.

29:19.137 --> 29:20.604
Ken's a very nice man.

29:20.681 --> 29:23.450
He's not really my type,
but I understand the impulse.

29:23.551 --> 29:24.768
Don't let him off the hook.

29:24.793 --> 29:26.143
You did a crappy thing, Alec...

29:26.168 --> 29:28.486
just because <i> you're</i> afraid
to talk about what happened.

29:28.639 --> 29:29.889
What is there to talk about?

29:29.940 --> 29:31.694
There's a <i> lot</i> to talk about.

29:32.660 --> 29:34.105
[Sighs]

29:34.528 --> 29:36.429
I felt something the other night...

29:36.431 --> 29:40.116
something that I haven't
felt in a long time.

29:40.868 --> 29:42.402
And I know that Alec did, too.

29:42.470 --> 29:43.870
Don't put words in my mouth.

29:43.938 --> 29:46.139
Then say something!

29:48.025 --> 29:49.676
[Sighs]

29:50.761 --> 29:52.662
I felt something, too.

29:55.449 --> 29:56.816
I don't know what it means.

29:58.219 --> 30:00.987
Maybe it doesn't mean anything.

30:01.088 --> 30:03.256
Or maybe it does.

30:03.290 --> 30:06.676
Maybe there's something
here that's worth exploring.

30:06.701 --> 30:08.761
- This is ridiculous.
- It's ridiculous? Why?

30:08.812 --> 30:10.363
Why? Why, Alec? Why is it ridiculous?

30:10.447 --> 30:11.898
Because there's nothing to explore.

30:11.966 --> 30:13.099
I should go.

30:13.150 --> 30:14.200
No, please, don't.

30:14.225 --> 30:15.359
I'm sorry.

I been on the freakin'
405 for the last two hours.

30:37.458 --> 30:39.792
I think we should see a shrink.

30:39.817 --> 30:41.512
I think we need to go to Rome.

30:41.780 --> 30:44.334
But we don't have time for
either of those things, so...

30:44.364 --> 30:46.799
Well, I think we should <i> make</i> time.

30:46.850 --> 30:50.436
Joss has a friend, Karen,
who's a psychiatrist,

30:50.504 --> 30:52.989
and I think she could refer someone.

30:53.014 --> 30:55.215
I don't need a psychiatrist, Calista.

30:55.342 --> 30:56.559
I need your support.

30:56.610 --> 30:58.077
I <i> give</i> you support.

No, you don't.

31:00.553 --> 31:02.491
the amount of pressure
I'm under every single day.

31:02.516 --> 31:03.783
We're <i> both</i> under pressure.

31:03.834 --> 31:05.634
Can you at least try and understand

31:05.659 --> 31:06.709
what it's like for me?

31:07.737 --> 31:08.937
Okay.

31:10.032 --> 31:11.691
I want to help.

31:12.839 --> 31:14.389
No, you don't.

31:14.695 --> 31:18.311
Because I ask you to do simple things,

31:20.233 --> 31:21.701
What? What have I not done?

31:21.735 --> 31:24.270
We need new models. We
got a show in New York.

31:24.304 --> 31:27.256
I sent you like 30 head shots,
you've signed off on no one.

31:27.281 --> 31:29.282
- I didn't like any of them.
- Mm-hmm.

31:29.435 --> 31:32.270
You were supposed to sign off
on the Italian fabric budget,

31:32.295 --> 31:33.646
you haven't even opened the e-mail.

31:33.697 --> 31:35.080
I <i> did</i> open the e-mail.

31:35.181 --> 31:36.582
The attachment wouldn't download.

31:36.633 --> 31:37.766
I told you that.

31:37.791 --> 31:40.009
Okay, do you see how you
have nothing but excuses?

31:40.034 --> 31:41.656
These aren't excuses. They're answers.

31:41.681 --> 31:42.863
Okay.

31:43.104 --> 31:46.948
What about the logo paperwork
I gave to you yesterday?

31:47.010 --> 31:49.228
Okay, I-I forgot to give it to Patty.

31:49.253 --> 31:50.705
Why do you got to give it to Patty?

32:03.077 --> 32:04.243
Yeah, I think I do.

32:05.745 --> 32:08.447
Luca, it's not that I don't
listen or I don't hear you,

32:08.449 --> 32:10.324
but there are still things here...

32:10.349 --> 32:12.700
legitimate things that we need to work on.

32:12.725 --> 32:16.861
And I really think it would
help if we see a shrink.

32:18.987 --> 32:20.646
I'd rather go to Rome.

32:20.727 --> 32:21.944
No.

Savi's always gonna be
a part of this equation.

Pretending that she isn't
is a huge waste of time.

This is a big deal.

Well, you're not being very
proactive about the relationship.

opportunity to say something,

fighting, so <i> I</i> left.

about <i> your</i> feelings?

34:31.525 --> 34:33.360
Why are theirs more important than yours?

34:33.385 --> 34:34.768
Because they're married.

34:34.793 --> 34:36.657
Yeah, and they invited
you into that marriage,

37:26.765 --> 37:30.038
I had the most amazing
class today in pilates.

37:30.063 --> 37:31.713
You have to come with me next time.

37:31.738 --> 37:33.636
At 5:00 in the morning? No, thank you.

37:33.661 --> 37:37.481
My teacher has me focusing
on gratitude and joy.

37:37.506 --> 37:39.097
They're my two new favorite words.

37:39.122 --> 37:40.220
You're in a good mood.

37:40.245 --> 37:41.411
I am.

37:41.436 --> 37:44.054
Things are on the up-and-up
again with Luca and me, so...

37:44.079 --> 37:45.646
That explains your generosity.

37:45.671 --> 37:48.089
I got a call from Luca's
attorney this morning.

37:48.114 --> 37:51.062
You gave Luca the entire
Accessories by Luca line?

37:51.087 --> 37:52.524
No. No.

37:52.549 --> 37:56.658
I approved he can use the
logo and the font for his line,

37:56.683 --> 37:58.167
but it's all under my umbrella.

37:58.192 --> 37:59.793
No, sweetie, you signed the papers

37:59.818 --> 38:01.319
that gave him his <i> own</i> umbrella.

38:01.344 --> 38:03.135
That's why he hired his own lawyer

38:03.160 --> 38:04.327
to write up the contracts.

38:04.378 --> 38:05.461
I assumed you knew.

38:05.512 --> 38:07.697
Why else wouldn't you
have had me take a look?

38:11.235 --> 38:14.237
Okay. We've covered a lot of ground today.

38:14.271 --> 38:16.673
Does anyone have anything
else they want to share

38:16.707 --> 38:18.608
before we wrap up?

38:18.642 --> 38:20.443
Any questions?

38:20.468 --> 38:21.602
<i>I</i> have a question.

38:23.147 --> 38:26.382
I'd like to know what happens
when a marriage is broken.

38:26.433 --> 38:29.786
Say your partner gets sick... so sick

38:29.811 --> 38:33.881
that both of you are separately
preparing for the worst.

38:33.991 --> 38:36.626
But then a miracle happens.

38:36.651 --> 38:38.335
The worst doesn't come.

38:38.360 --> 38:39.893
The life is saved.

38:39.918 --> 38:41.440
But the marriage...

38:42.278 --> 38:44.896
The marriage has suffered
irreparable damage.

38:46.835 --> 38:48.569
And then something new comes along,

38:48.972 --> 38:56.045
something strange and
taboo and... unimaginable.

38:56.063 --> 38:59.465
And suddenly, it feels like
the marriage could change form.

38:59.490 --> 39:00.991
It will never be the same.

39:01.016 --> 39:02.340
But maybe...

39:04.314 --> 39:07.099
Just maybe, it could
find a new way to exist.

39:08.890 --> 39:10.774
Would you risk it?

39:10.799 --> 39:11.883
[Chuckles lightly]

39:11.908 --> 39:13.355
Absolutely.

39:14.176 --> 39:17.365
If something unique and
unexpectedly beautiful

39:17.390 --> 39:18.814
came along...

39:19.642 --> 39:21.593
I know <i> I</i> would.

[Knock on door]

39:33.934 --> 39:35.484
Hey.

39:35.569 --> 39:37.152
Hi.

39:37.254 --> 39:38.804
Can we chat a minute?

39:38.889 --> 39:41.407
Sure. Come on in.

39:44.060 --> 39:46.378
âª You're all I've ever wanted âª

39:46.403 --> 39:47.680
[Clears throat]

39:47.705 --> 39:49.122
Listen, Harry, I'm... I'm sorry

39:49.147 --> 39:50.498
about walking out last night.

39:50.523 --> 39:52.474
It was really... it was unacceptable.

39:52.661 --> 39:54.178
And, you know, I-I don't know.

39:54.203 --> 39:57.221
I think I was tired or hungry or something.

39:57.246 --> 39:58.854
And not that that's an excuse...

39:58.879 --> 40:00.896
I can't do this anymore, Joss.

40:02.714 --> 40:03.897
You can't do what?

40:04.247 --> 40:06.065
It shouldn't be this hard.

40:08.385 --> 40:09.601
Harry.

40:09.686 --> 40:10.986
We keep going on like this,

40:11.054 --> 40:13.155
we're gonna end up
hating each other forever.

40:13.825 --> 40:15.369
We have to end it now

40:15.394 --> 40:17.562
so there can at least be
hope for us in the future.

40:17.587 --> 40:18.588
What?

40:18.613 --> 40:20.747
Listen, I...

40:21.227 --> 40:23.661
I think you were right about us all along.

40:26.090 --> 40:28.007
It's too soon.

40:28.123 --> 40:29.807
We're just not ready.

40:29.832 --> 40:34.202
âª I want you âª

40:34.227 --> 40:36.309
âª Only you âª

40:36.334 --> 40:38.369
[Sniffles]

40:40.350 --> 40:45.317
âª I want you âª

40:45.994 --> 40:51.446
âª Only you âª

40:52.646 --> 40:56.482
âª And I can start it over âª

40:56.507 --> 40:58.072
[Door closes]

40:58.449 --> 41:02.467
âª And find somebody new âª
