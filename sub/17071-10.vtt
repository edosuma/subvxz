17:48.168 --> 17:50.303
Apple.
Excellent choice.

17:50.337 --> 17:52.405
Rene Russo
ordered the same thing.

18:01.248 --> 18:02.549
That's better.

18:02.582 --> 18:05.552
Welcome to
the Best of Orlando Awards,

18:05.585 --> 18:07.154
Huang House edition.

18:07.187 --> 18:10.790
I see there are some very pretty
mommies in the crowd tonight.

18:12.859 --> 18:15.228
Moving on.
[ Chuckles nervously ]

18:15.262 --> 18:16.729
Please put your hands together

18:16.763 --> 18:20.667
for Orlando's
Small Businessman of the Year,

18:20.700 --> 18:23.270
Louis Huang!

18:24.604 --> 18:25.772
Oh. [ Chuckles ]

18:25.805 --> 18:27.307
Congratulations, sir.

18:27.340 --> 18:28.908
It's not every day
a family --

18:28.941 --> 18:31.744
Okay, buddy,
it's Dad's turn now.

18:31.778 --> 18:35.081
Wow, uh,
this is really incredible.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.116
A lot of people
contributed to this --

18:37.150 --> 18:39.619
my boys, neighbors, Marv--

18:39.652 --> 18:41.454
u-uh, n-neighbors,

18:41.488 --> 18:43.856
my hardworking staff.

18:43.890 --> 18:46.593
But the one
who deserves the most credit,

18:46.626 --> 18:48.928
is my beautiful wife,
Jessica.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.664
She's the one
who never gets thanked,

18:51.698 --> 18:54.634
the unsung hero
of all our success.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.135
If it wasn't
for everything she does,

18:56.169 --> 18:58.305
there would never be
a Cattleman's Ranch,

18:58.338 --> 19:00.540
let alone
an award for me to accept.

19:00.573 --> 19:03.109
Now, I know
most of you are here tonight

19:03.142 --> 19:06.112
because she forced you
into coming by sheer will.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.848
Maybe you're annoyed by it.
You probably are.

19:08.881 --> 19:11.718
But the thing is,
she does it out of love.

19:11.751 --> 19:16.055
And I stand here not only
as a result of that love,

19:16.088 --> 19:17.624
but in awe of it.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.292
[ Inhales deeply ]

19:19.326 --> 19:22.695
That's why I cannot accept
this award tonight.

19:22.729 --> 19:24.297
[ Gasps ]

19:24.331 --> 19:27.467
Because it only has
 my name on it

19:27.500 --> 19:29.369
when it should
have hers, too.

19:31.504 --> 19:34.874
She is the best of Orlando.

19:37.109 --> 19:39.879
[ Voice breaking ]
Thank you.

19:39.912 --> 19:42.682
Sometimes, things like that
are just nice to hear.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.485
That was
a beautiful speech.

19:45.518 --> 19:48.221
I just wish I could've said it
in front of everyone.

19:48.255 --> 19:51.758
It means more in front
of an audience of one.

19:55.262 --> 19:56.863
Did you hear all of that,
Aunt Connie?

19:56.896 --> 19:57.930
Connie: Mm-hmm.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.700
They're kissing now.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.502
Movie-style.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.203
That's inappropriate.

20:06.539 --> 20:09.342
Grandma, I know
we pre-negotiated your cut,

20:09.376 --> 20:12.479
but, in light of current events,
can you take less?

20:15.615 --> 20:18.685
After subtracting Grandma's cut,
the cost of fabric

20:18.718 --> 20:21.788
and Blow Pops,
how much money did we make?

20:22.722 --> 20:24.357
$3.89.

20:24.391 --> 20:26.025
So we broke exactly even.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.860
And we're down
a yellow Starburst.

20:27.894 --> 20:31.197
I guess in the world of fashion,
trends can change fast.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.199
It's a tough lesson
to learn.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.434
But in a way,

20:34.467 --> 20:36.703
isn't knowledge the most
valuable currency of all --

20:36.736 --> 20:37.570
No!

20:45.978 --> 20:47.714
And I stand here not only
as a result of that love,

20:47.747 --> 20:49.316
but in awe of it.

20:49.349 --> 20:51.884
That's why I cannot
accept this award tonight.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.052
[ Gasps ]

20:53.085 --> 20:55.087
Because this only has
 my name on it,

20:55.121 --> 20:57.824
when it should have hers,
too.

20:57.857 --> 21:00.126
She's the best of Orlando.

21:00.159 --> 21:02.395
I'm the best of Orlando,
Deidre!

21:02.429 --> 21:04.163
Sorry I didn't
return your calls,

21:04.196 --> 21:08.401
but, to answer your question,
I'm doing great.

21:08.435 --> 21:11.304
Yeeeeeeeah.

21:11.338 --> 21:12.439
Yeeeeah.

21:12.472 --> 21:13.940
Yeah.

21:15.842 --> 21:17.577
[ Sighs ]

21:17.610 --> 21:20.246
Did you notice the phrasing I
used when we were back at home?

21:20.279 --> 21:21.581
I didn't lie.

21:21.614 --> 21:25.151
I said, "It means more
in front of an audience of one."

21:25.184 --> 21:27.253
There are 26 more ones.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.155
You didn't lie.
