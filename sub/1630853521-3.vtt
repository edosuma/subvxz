00:03.133 --> 00:04.178
Have you narrowed
down your selection?

00:04.221 --> 00:05.701
Picking Choi's replacement

00:05.744 --> 00:07.616
as head deputy DA
should not be my job.

00:07.659 --> 00:09.226
Miss Sara Castillo!

00:09.270 --> 00:10.923
Know what you're
getting yourself into?

00:10.967 --> 00:12.969
I am looking forward
to helping victims

00:13.013 --> 00:14.797
and witnesses
become survivors.

00:14.840 --> 00:17.060
Holistic law is not just
about defending clients,

00:17.104 --> 00:18.670
you represent them
in landlord tenant disputes,

00:18.714 --> 00:20.716
immigration proceedings,
child custody battles.

00:20.759 --> 00:22.283
Sherri Kansky,

00:22.326 --> 00:23.719
we're hear regarding

00:23.762 --> 00:25.373
an investigation
into alleged impropriety

00:25.416 --> 00:27.244
in the election
of Judge Lola Carmichael.

00:27.288 --> 00:28.898
The election
could be nullified.

00:28.941 --> 00:30.421
I could
lose my judgeship.

for a few days now.

00:55.533 --> 00:57.057
Aww.

01:00.886 --> 01:03.106
I guess she figured it out.

01:03.150 --> 01:05.195
Probably time
to lower the crib mattress.

01:05.239 --> 01:07.980
And don't worry,

01:08.024 --> 01:10.679
we can finish

The Public Integrity Unit
hearing coming up

isn't helping
to ease the tension either.

Sherri did
nothing wrong,

02:45.382 --> 02:46.818
Hey, Mark, yeah,

my new roommate's
moving in today.

02:48.472 --> 02:49.778
Yeah,
I shouldn't be much longer.

02:49.821 --> 02:51.214
Oh, there he is.

02:51.258 --> 02:52.824
All right.
I will be there shortly.

02:57.829 --> 03:00.005
- Hi, roomie.
- Hey, Zachary.

03:00.049 --> 03:01.964
Oh, I thought
I mentioned

03:02.007 --> 03:03.748
the place
is fully furnished, so...

03:04.532 --> 03:06.229
Is that a coffin?

03:06.273 --> 03:08.927
Oh, geez, no, that's
a illusion box.

03:08.971 --> 03:11.147
A what now?
- A illusion box.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.236
- It's for work.
- I thought you said

03:13.280 --> 03:14.716
you worked in entertainment.

03:14.759 --> 03:16.413
Correct.
I'm a magician.

03:16.457 --> 03:17.980
And from now on,
you're going to be

03:18.023 --> 03:19.721
on my VIP list
to see me perform

03:19.764 --> 03:21.984
- at the Magic Castle.
- Ooh.

03:22.027 --> 03:25.117
Okay, well,
I am late for work, so...

03:25.161 --> 03:26.815

03:26.858 --> 03:28.730
Oh, honey, don't worry.

03:37.478 --> 03:38.957
Perfect.
Thank you so much.

03:39.828 --> 03:41.177
Who's the second one for?

03:41.221 --> 03:42.787
For me.
They are both for me.

03:42.831 --> 03:44.311
I love my nephews,

03:44.354 --> 03:45.877
but they have
twice the energy I do.

03:45.921 --> 03:47.749
How long are you staying
with your brother?

03:47.792 --> 03:50.404
Till I find a place.
I now regret selling my house.

03:50.447 --> 03:52.536
You know,
you can stay with me.

03:53.929 --> 03:56.323
I mean, on the couch,
and I promise, I do not have

03:56.366 --> 03:57.759
a lot of
energy these days.

03:58.325 --> 04:00.283
Because you said your
nephews had a lot of energy.

04:00.327 --> 04:01.806
No strings attached.
I'm barely home.

04:01.850 --> 04:03.286
I'm just trying
to give you options.

04:03.330 --> 04:04.679
No, I know.

04:04.722 --> 04:06.507
I just--
I appreciate it, I'd--

04:06.550 --> 04:07.682
- but--
- Right.

04:07.725 --> 04:08.944
So you got a case?

04:08.987 --> 04:11.120
Yeah, mayhem.

04:11.163 --> 04:12.774
A young mom
who allegedly threw

04:12.817 --> 04:14.732
a pot of boiling water
on her landlady.

04:14.776 --> 04:16.299
I'm on my way
to meet her now.

04:16.343 --> 04:19.041
Oh, wait,
so that means you got the job?

04:19.084 --> 04:20.999
I did,
I'm officially

04:21.043 --> 04:23.437
with
Free Counsel Initiative now.

04:23.480 --> 04:24.960
Hell yeah.

04:25.003 --> 04:26.266
Emily Lopez
working for the biggest

04:26.309 --> 04:27.658
pro-bono
law firm in the world?

04:27.702 --> 04:30.270
No pressure,
no, none whatsoever.

04:30.313 --> 04:32.315
So Carol tells me
there's a new PD

04:32.359 --> 04:34.361
- coming in from San Francisco.
- Yeah. Olivia.

04:34.404 --> 04:35.971
She's second chair
in my next case.

04:36.014 --> 04:37.320
- What's your case?
- It's ridiculous.

04:37.364 --> 04:39.627
We're defending
a rat thief.

04:39.670 --> 04:41.629
Yeah. The guy stole
a two-headed rat from a lab.

04:41.672 --> 04:43.413
- Two heads, wow.
- There are more important cases

04:43.457 --> 04:45.197
going on
and I get assigned this.

04:45.241 --> 04:46.547
Ah, ah, ah, no.

04:46.590 --> 04:48.200
You are
a public defender now.

04:48.244 --> 04:50.333
Every case
is important, okay?

04:50.377 --> 04:52.857
Remember that.
I'm running late, I got to go.

04:52.901 --> 04:54.511
You'll be great.
Catch up soon?

04:54.555 --> 04:56.034
You know
where to find me.

04:56.078 --> 04:58.210
And congrats
on the new job.

04:58.254 --> 04:59.777
Thanks.

05:01.779 --> 05:03.520
Mrs. Neal showed up
when I was making dinner

05:03.564 --> 05:06.393
for my kids
and we got into an argument.

05:06.436 --> 05:08.220
What was
the argument about?

05:08.264 --> 05:10.222
She wanted
to raise rent again.

05:10.266 --> 05:11.528
At this point
she's just taking advantage.

05:11.572 --> 05:13.313
So this has been
an ongoing issue.

05:13.356 --> 05:14.618
Yeah, I mean,
the lease says

05:14.662 --> 05:16.316
I have the first
five days to pay,

05:16.359 --> 05:18.361
but if I don't drop
a check off on the first,

05:18.405 --> 05:19.841
she just loses it.

05:20.885 --> 05:22.365
How did
Mrs. Neal get burned?

05:23.410 --> 05:26.413
She got too close to me,
and I pushed her.

05:26.456 --> 05:29.851
She lost balance and nocked
this pot down off the stove.

05:29.894 --> 05:31.374
The hot water
fell on her.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.898
She had third
and fourth degree burns.

05:33.942 --> 05:36.814
And I feel bad about that,
but it was a total accident.

05:36.858 --> 05:39.513
Do you have any witnesses
that can corroborate this?

05:39.556 --> 05:40.862
Yeah, my kids.

05:41.819 --> 05:43.691
But I don't want
to get them involved in this.

05:44.474 --> 05:47.259
They've been
through a lot already.

05:47.303 --> 05:49.958
I haven't
seen them in weeks.

05:51.002 --> 05:52.613
I am all they have.

05:54.179 --> 05:56.965
Charlotte,
I am going to do

05:57.008 --> 05:59.141
my best
to get you out of custody

05:59.184 --> 06:02.231
so they can be with you
before and during the trial.

06:18.073 --> 06:19.727
- Black Americano.
- I am not doing

06:19.770 --> 06:20.989
caffeine for now,
but thank you.

06:21.642 --> 06:23.774
Smart.
Healthy. I like it.

06:23.818 --> 06:25.297
The Public Integrity Unit

06:25.341 --> 06:26.777
has requested
we both speak to them

06:26.821 --> 06:28.213
in connection
with their investigation.

06:28.257 --> 06:30.302
Well,
we've been expecting that.

06:30.346 --> 06:31.739
I know
what I'm going to say,

06:31.782 --> 06:33.436
but I don't know
what you're going to say.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.569
Maybe we should
link up our statements.

06:50.714 --> 06:53.978
Teddy Biswas
can you just join the office.

06:55.632 --> 06:57.112
They're still
bribing you to get the job?

06:57.155 --> 06:58.853
Well,
trying unsuccessfully.

06:58.896 --> 07:00.855
But yeah, I really need
to pick someone soon.

07:00.898 --> 07:03.248
Take your time.
Choi isn't easy to replace.

07:03.292 --> 07:05.599
And I do not see
you reporting to Maggie Palmer.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.166
So, listen,
you're going to be

07:08.210 --> 07:09.559
prosecuting a woman
charged with mayhem.

07:09.603 --> 07:11.169
Defense attorney
is Emily Lopez.

07:11.213 --> 07:13.171
I can handle Emily.
Thanks, boss.

07:13.215 --> 07:14.608
I'm not your boss.

07:14.651 --> 07:18.263
You are today, boss.

07:20.265 --> 07:21.484
Boss.

07:30.537 --> 07:31.973
Yeah,
this is Mark Callan,

07:32.016 --> 07:33.409
interim head deputy.

07:34.541 --> 07:36.281
Can I get
the name of the DDA

07:36.325 --> 07:38.153
who approved the election
impropriety investigation?

07:38.893 --> 07:40.024
Yeah.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.072
There are less
restrictive means

07:44.115 --> 07:46.378
that the court
should employ instead of bail.

07:46.422 --> 07:47.945
Your Honor,
house arrest isn't an option.

07:47.989 --> 07:49.773
The owner
of Miss Collins' apartment

07:49.817 --> 07:51.340
is the victim here.
The victim?

07:51.383 --> 07:53.211
Well,
that's still in dispute.

07:53.255 --> 07:54.691
Miss Lopez.

07:54.735 --> 07:56.606
I'm sorry,
Your Honor, I'm sorry.

07:57.346 --> 07:59.870
I believe the Southland
Women's Reentry Center

07:59.914 --> 08:02.830
would be a great place
for my client to await trial.

08:02.873 --> 08:04.484
We satisfied
protection of the public,

08:04.527 --> 08:06.355
and she gets to maintain
custody of her children.

08:06.398 --> 08:08.270
A center, like rehab?

08:08.313 --> 08:10.664
- Where would the children live?
- With her, Your Honor.

08:10.707 --> 08:12.883
Many women
live there with their children.

08:12.927 --> 08:14.494
It's an alternative
to incarceration for women.

08:14.537 --> 08:15.712
And there's
treatment involved.

08:15.756 --> 08:17.061
Yes, Your Honor.

08:17.105 --> 08:18.672
My client
has no drug use history,

08:18.715 --> 08:20.674
but she has admitted
to heavy drinking

08:20.717 --> 08:22.545
and impulse control.

08:22.589 --> 08:24.895
She would get AA meetings
and anger management therapy.

08:27.245 --> 08:28.899
Miss Foster,
any opposition to this?

08:28.943 --> 08:30.727
I object, Your Honor.

08:30.771 --> 08:32.599
We're here to bring
justice and protect victims,

08:32.642 --> 08:34.688
not reward
criminals with safe havens.

08:38.996 --> 08:41.216
I am granting
the defense's motion.

08:41.259 --> 08:43.435
Keeping everyone safe

08:43.479 --> 08:45.612
not only includes the victim,
but also innocent children

08:45.655 --> 08:47.483
and we can
achieve both.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.399
Miss Collins
is conditionally released

08:50.442 --> 08:52.096
to a representative

08:52.140 --> 08:53.794
from the Southland
Women's Reentry Center.

08:53.837 --> 08:55.360
I will see
everyone in two days

08:55.404 --> 08:56.884
for the pretrial conference.

08:56.927 --> 08:58.494
That will be the order.

08:58.538 --> 08:59.974
Court is adjourned.

09:06.023 --> 09:07.764
Thrilled to go
to war with you again.

09:07.808 --> 09:09.461
Always a pleasure.

09:13.030 --> 09:15.598
Welcome back
to the HOJ Miss Lopez.

09:15.642 --> 09:17.295
Thank you.

09:22.953 --> 09:24.868
What's a gift card up to?

09:24.912 --> 09:26.304
About 30,
give or take.

09:26.348 --> 09:27.610
Oh, great.

09:27.654 --> 09:29.394
I got another one
here for you.

09:29.438 --> 09:30.918
I need you to advise

09:30.961 --> 09:32.484
on the LAPD smash
and grab task force.

09:33.660 --> 09:35.923
So why are you here?

09:35.966 --> 09:37.446
You approve
the investigation

09:37.489 --> 09:38.926
into Lola Carmichael's
campaign.

09:39.666 --> 09:42.190
Why?
And why is it still going on?

09:42.233 --> 09:44.148
If I didn't approve it,
someone else would have.

09:44.192 --> 09:45.497
The evidence is tenable.

09:45.541 --> 09:47.630
What's tenable
about a seminar?

09:47.674 --> 09:49.719
This feels more
like a political hit job to me.

09:49.763 --> 09:51.765
So, you know, who's behind it?

09:51.808 --> 09:53.288
- Fred Martin Moore?
- Okay, easy.

09:53.331 --> 09:55.507
Callan, that's too far.

09:55.551 --> 09:58.075
- Was it the Crenshaw District?
- This isn't about Martin Moore,

09:58.119 --> 09:59.816
and it's not
about Crenshaw anymore.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.688
Maybe you need
to bring your friends down

10:01.731 --> 10:03.515
from the pedestal
you've put them on.

10:03.559 --> 10:05.213
Fine,
I'll find out another way.

10:05.256 --> 10:08.042
If you use any resources
from our office for this,

10:08.085 --> 10:09.652
you're done.

10:09.696 --> 10:11.567
Like I said,
I'll find out another way.

10:20.097 --> 10:22.012
Dr. Jill,
do you swear to tell the truth,

10:22.056 --> 10:23.666
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

10:23.710 --> 10:26.234
- I do, Your Honor.
- Be seated.

10:26.277 --> 10:27.627
Mr. Berger,
your witness.

10:27.670 --> 10:30.499
Dr. Jill.
What is your occupation?

10:30.542 --> 10:32.632
I'm the chief scientist
at Vanguard Labs.

10:32.675 --> 10:34.372
I oversee the operations

10:34.416 --> 10:35.765
and I coordinate
scientific research.

10:35.809 --> 10:37.245
Do you see anyone else

10:37.288 --> 10:38.855
from Vanguard Labs
in this room?

10:39.682 --> 10:42.250
Mr. Park,
he worked with us in tech,

10:42.293 --> 10:44.295
and he stole
my research.

10:44.339 --> 10:46.123
The witness
has identified the defendant.

10:46.167 --> 10:48.865
- And by research, you mean?
- A rat.

10:48.909 --> 10:50.737
They were
experimenting with it.

10:50.780 --> 10:53.174
- It was animal abuse.
- You know what bothers me more

10:53.217 --> 10:54.697
than the unvaccinated?

10:54.741 --> 10:56.177
Interruptions.

10:56.220 --> 10:57.831
Won't happen again,
Your Honor.

10:57.874 --> 10:59.571
Dr. Jill,
could you explain

10:59.615 --> 11:02.139
- why you test on animals?
- Some experimental models

11:02.183 --> 11:05.099
are impossible
to replicate in human subjects.

11:05.142 --> 11:07.188
When a new drug
is being created,

11:07.231 --> 11:08.711
it's unethical for us
to start with humans.

11:08.755 --> 11:10.800
We need to test
on animals first

11:10.844 --> 11:13.455
until we make sure it's
safe to transition to humans.

11:13.498 --> 11:15.283
So it's necessary?
Absolutely.

11:15.326 --> 11:16.676
We're saving lives.

11:22.986 --> 11:24.596
Stick to answering
the questions

11:24.640 --> 11:26.207
about the seminar only.

11:26.250 --> 11:28.165
What else
would they question me about?

11:28.209 --> 11:30.690
Well, I wouldn't be surprised
if they come up with threats

11:30.733 --> 11:32.866
or false accusations
to throw you off.

11:32.909 --> 11:34.519
- Why would they do that?
- Sometimes they bluff

11:34.563 --> 11:36.347
to scare you
off something bigger

11:36.391 --> 11:38.785
so that the issue at hand
seems smaller to confess to.

11:38.828 --> 11:40.830
I thought those tactics
were only used with criminals.

11:40.874 --> 11:42.745
- Not exactly.
- Why would they treat me

11:42.789 --> 11:44.878
like a criminal before giving
me the chance to clarify.

11:44.921 --> 11:47.489
- Miss Kansky, I'm only try--
- I have nothing to hide.

11:47.532 --> 11:48.969
- Your Honor--
- Okay.

11:49.012 --> 11:50.361
Why don't we
take a break?

11:50.405 --> 11:52.494
Great idea.
I'm starving.

11:55.279 --> 11:57.194
Sherri,
it will be fine.

11:57.238 --> 11:59.196
We just tell the truth,
do what David Sanders tells us,

11:59.240 --> 12:01.938
and we will be laughing
about this in a couple of days.

12:01.982 --> 12:03.505
Your Honor,
this is turning out to be

12:03.548 --> 12:05.550
a lot more serious
than I initially thought

12:05.594 --> 12:09.119
and I'm willing to resign
to avoid any blowback on you.

12:09.163 --> 12:11.731
What? Sherri, no!
We are in this together.

12:14.472 --> 12:16.039
I get
that she's a single mom,

12:16.083 --> 12:18.346
but I also need
my money on time.

12:18.389 --> 12:20.391
Walk us through
the night, Mrs. Neal.

12:20.435 --> 12:22.393
I could smell
alcohol on her breath.

12:23.525 --> 12:24.700
She'd been drinking.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.180
She got aggressive.

12:26.223 --> 12:28.008
I told her
I would call the cops.

12:28.051 --> 12:30.488
She was making dinner.

12:31.446 --> 12:33.796
And before I knew it,

12:33.840 --> 12:36.668
she threw a pot
of boiling water at me.

12:44.241 --> 12:46.069
I will look like this forever.

12:48.463 --> 12:51.118
Mrs. Neal,
what you went through

12:51.161 --> 12:53.337
is very traumatic.

12:54.686 --> 12:56.601
Have you considered
joining a support group

12:56.645 --> 12:59.561
or getting
individual therapy?

13:02.912 --> 13:05.697
I would love
to provide you some options.

13:14.445 --> 13:15.620
We'll do his charge.

13:16.273 --> 13:17.579
Give me one
that works for you.

13:17.622 --> 13:19.146
Assault by means likely

13:19.189 --> 13:21.409
with a great bodily
injury enhancement.

13:21.452 --> 13:23.715
The max
would be seven years.

13:23.759 --> 13:25.630
Can we drop the enhancement
and do time suspended?

13:25.674 --> 13:28.503
No, I am not going along
with a non-strike in this case.

13:28.546 --> 13:30.853
Your client's
actions were extreme

13:30.897 --> 13:33.464
and the victim's
injuries are permanent.

13:33.508 --> 13:36.728
Look, she has two kids
that will end up

13:36.772 --> 13:38.818
in the system
if she does any prison time.

13:43.344 --> 13:46.869
Okay, how about
plead with strike

13:46.913 --> 13:48.523
for probation
and four year suspended?

13:52.701 --> 13:55.573
Okay, but I am
not agreeing to her staying

13:55.617 --> 13:56.792
in the Women's Reentry Center.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.533
That program is new

13:58.576 --> 14:00.491
and there is not enough
data that supports

14:00.535 --> 14:02.842
the recovery rate
that they claim to have.

14:06.019 --> 14:08.151
I'm not pleading guilty,
Mr. Watkins. I'm sorry.

14:08.195 --> 14:09.936
Berger offered
a good deal.

14:09.979 --> 14:11.807
The rat was abused,
and the lab isn't even working

14:11.851 --> 14:13.461
on meds or cures
for illnesses.

14:13.504 --> 14:15.071
They're working
on a new weight loss pill.

14:15.115 --> 14:16.681
And fashion vitamins
to sell on Instagram.

14:16.725 --> 14:18.683
Capitalism
disguised as wellness.

14:18.727 --> 14:20.685
And that's exactly
what I'll say on the stand.

14:20.729 --> 14:22.339
Kevin, the lab
and the work that they do

14:22.383 --> 14:23.993
are not on trial here,
you are.

14:24.037 --> 14:25.777
It does explain
his motive, though.

14:26.517 --> 14:28.084
This is the picture
I took of the rat

14:28.128 --> 14:29.259
when I saved its life.

14:30.434 --> 14:32.001
Whoa. What is that?

14:32.045 --> 14:33.263
Its second head.

14:39.922 --> 14:41.881
I get why you did
what you did, Kevin.

14:41.924 --> 14:43.404
It was very noble.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.841
It'll be uphill battle,
but it's one worth fighting.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.190
But we don't have
a strong defense

14:47.234 --> 14:48.800
and Berger
is not an easy opponent.

14:48.844 --> 14:50.454
We'll just
have to use what we know

14:50.498 --> 14:52.108
- about him against him.
- What do you mean?

14:52.152 --> 14:53.936
Berger hates surprises,

14:53.980 --> 14:56.373
and he's not much
of an animal lover.

14:56.417 --> 14:57.940
- Are you suggesting--
- We surprise him.

15:03.119 --> 15:04.773
Oh, Mr. Callan.

15:05.469 --> 15:07.428
What brings you
to the Public Integrity Unit?

15:07.471 --> 15:09.647
You know,
I'm just stretching my legs.

15:09.691 --> 15:11.040
They put me
in charge

15:11.084 --> 15:12.650
of finding
a replacement for Choi

15:12.694 --> 15:15.871
and let me tell you,
the options are lacking.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.220
Oh, yeah.

15:18.787 --> 15:20.180
Do you think that one of you
can help me find this file?

15:20.223 --> 15:22.791
Oh, I'll get it.

15:22.834 --> 15:24.271
He's a junior DA.

15:24.314 --> 15:26.142
Doesn't have
access to this.

15:26.186 --> 15:27.274
Thank you.

15:28.536 --> 15:30.103
She's fast.

15:32.496 --> 15:33.845
All right.

15:33.889 --> 15:35.499
Hey.
Good to see you.

15:54.257 --> 15:56.303
Hey, Robin...

15:56.346 --> 15:58.000
I need you to look
into something for me,

15:58.044 --> 16:01.090
and you cannot tell Lola.

16:09.055 --> 16:10.143
How are they?

16:11.492 --> 16:13.755
Better,
now that we're together.

16:14.625 --> 16:16.540
Thank you
so much, really.

16:16.584 --> 16:17.672
You're welcome.

16:18.368 --> 16:19.543
I'll be right back, okay?

16:21.458 --> 16:23.156
So listen,
I think I got them

16:23.199 --> 16:24.766
as low as they're
going to go, okay?

16:24.809 --> 16:26.420
Plead to a strike
for probation

16:26.463 --> 16:28.117
and four years suspended.

16:28.161 --> 16:30.641
- Four years in prison?
- No, I'm sorry.

16:30.685 --> 16:32.295
Suspended means
that you will only serve

16:32.339 --> 16:33.818
the time
if you violate probation.

16:33.862 --> 16:35.255
And we both know

16:35.298 --> 16:37.039
that you are
not going to do that.

16:37.083 --> 16:39.085
I didn't do this either,
didn't hurt anyone.

16:39.128 --> 16:41.261
I know, but you need
to plead to the assault

16:41.304 --> 16:42.566
to get the deal.

16:42.610 --> 16:44.220
If not,
we go to trial.

16:44.264 --> 16:46.440
And if we lose,
you could go to prison.

16:49.878 --> 16:51.053
What about
my green card?

16:52.489 --> 16:55.362
I mean, if it's on my record
that I assaulted someone

16:55.405 --> 16:56.841
could it be taken away?

16:58.017 --> 16:59.496
You're not a citizen?

17:00.193 --> 17:01.411
No, I'm Canadian.

17:02.369 --> 17:03.413
Could I get deported?

17:04.327 --> 17:06.764
Why am I hearing
about this now?

17:06.808 --> 17:08.331
I figured
it was in the file.

17:08.375 --> 17:10.246
No, it wasn't.

17:11.204 --> 17:12.335
Is this a problem?

17:14.555 --> 17:15.643
It is.

17:16.948 --> 17:20.561
We are--
we are back to square one.

17:22.128 --> 17:24.130
I need to--
I'll be in touch.

17:29.874 --> 17:31.746
You two
will do great tomorrow.

17:31.789 --> 17:33.835
Think of this as an opportunity
to clarify things.

17:33.878 --> 17:35.402
- Thank you, David.
- Thank you.

17:35.445 --> 17:37.534
Please, I have to
get back to work.

17:40.624 --> 17:43.453
I believe
a little bit of distance

17:43.497 --> 17:46.108
between you and Miss Kansky
might be necessary.

17:46.152 --> 17:48.110
Oh, okay.

17:48.154 --> 17:49.633
Mark and I
do this all the time

17:49.677 --> 17:51.287
- whenever we have a case.
- Let me rephrase,

17:51.331 --> 17:53.159
this thing
with the Public Integrity Unit

17:53.202 --> 17:54.551
could get really ugly.

17:54.595 --> 17:55.900
I think
you should consider

17:55.944 --> 17:57.424
letting Miss Kansky go.

18:10.872 --> 18:13.266
- Hey.
- Hey, I heard about the plea.

18:13.309 --> 18:15.181
You know,

18:15.224 --> 18:17.705
I just-- I wish Mrs. Neil
would get some justice.

18:17.748 --> 18:19.315
She is terrified
of retaliation,

18:19.359 --> 18:21.143
and she does have a point.

18:21.187 --> 18:23.624
Your client has a history
of anger management issues.

18:23.667 --> 18:25.104
But no history
of assaulting people, okay?

18:25.147 --> 18:26.888
For all we know,
Mrs. Neal could be lying

18:26.931 --> 18:29.673
- about what happened.
- She has no motive to lie.

18:29.717 --> 18:31.632
Your client,
on the other hand,

18:31.675 --> 18:33.112
doesn't want
to lose her kids,

18:33.155 --> 18:34.504
but doesn't
want them to testify.

18:34.548 --> 18:35.984
I mean,
I know she loves them,

18:36.027 --> 18:37.681
but maybe
she's the one that's lying.

18:37.725 --> 18:39.857
It's our first case
on opposite sides.

18:39.901 --> 18:42.121
Mr. Lopez,
finally made your way back.

18:42.164 --> 18:43.644
Hey, Callan.

18:43.687 --> 18:45.950
Wow, I didn't know
you were a hugger.

18:45.994 --> 18:47.822
I guess I just
miss kicking your ass in court.

18:47.865 --> 18:49.867
Oh, you mean getting
your ass kicked in court?

18:49.911 --> 18:51.782
All right, well,
good to have you back.

18:51.826 --> 18:53.610
Oh, hey, I'm sorry.

18:53.654 --> 18:55.221
Sorry that you're still
playing for the wrong team.

18:55.264 --> 18:56.744
If you're
looking for my team,

18:56.787 --> 18:57.875
Carol Foster's
looking for you outside.

18:57.919 --> 18:59.181
- Hi, Sara.
- Hi.

19:00.269 --> 19:02.358
I am taking
a holistic approach

19:02.402 --> 19:03.794
with Kiara, too,

19:03.838 --> 19:05.405
instead of barging
in her office,

19:05.448 --> 19:06.928
I'm going to
buy her a drink.

19:08.495 --> 19:09.800
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

19:20.811 --> 19:23.118
Sherri?
- Sara.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.294
Where have you been?

19:25.338 --> 19:26.817
For a moment,
I thought your roommate

19:26.861 --> 19:28.471
made you disappear.

19:28.515 --> 19:30.821
You've been
sitting on that one.

19:30.865 --> 19:32.475
[giggling
What's his name again?

19:32.519 --> 19:34.521
Oh, Zachary Holmes.

19:34.564 --> 19:37.045
Holmes,
that's such a stage name.

19:37.088 --> 19:38.177
Yeah, it must be.

19:40.701 --> 19:42.703
So, how are you feeling

19:42.746 --> 19:44.139
about the hearing tomorrow?

19:44.966 --> 19:46.272
I don't know.

19:46.315 --> 19:47.490
Feels like
she trusts David Sanders

19:47.534 --> 19:48.796
- more than me.
- What?

19:48.839 --> 19:50.232
No way.

19:50.276 --> 19:52.800
No, he just knows
the ins and outs

19:52.843 --> 19:55.498
of campaigning,
and she values his opinion.

19:55.542 --> 19:56.673
But she used to value mine.

19:58.414 --> 20:00.242
Now it's clear
that I'm just her clerk.

20:00.286 --> 20:03.811
Sherri,
you are a huge gift to us.

20:03.854 --> 20:05.682
To me,
and especially

20:05.726 --> 20:07.684
to Judge Carmichael,
she loves you.

20:09.817 --> 20:11.906
Don't devalue yourself.

20:13.603 --> 20:16.171
You don't have to be
so strong all the time.

20:28.270 --> 20:29.619
May I give you
a ride home?

20:30.316 --> 20:31.534
Come on.

20:34.407 --> 20:35.669
Only if you
promise to tell me

20:35.712 --> 20:37.540
all about Mr. Holmes.

20:37.584 --> 20:41.588
I don't know
what I'm going to walk into

20:41.631 --> 20:43.677
when I get home tonight.

20:46.984 --> 20:49.030
So I read the file
on the investigation

20:49.073 --> 20:50.423
into Lola's campaign.

20:50.466 --> 20:52.033
I don't like
where this is going.

20:52.076 --> 20:54.383
It started
with Sherri's seminar,

20:54.427 --> 20:57.343
but it led
to something way bigger.

20:57.386 --> 20:59.345
Half a million dollars
was transferred

20:59.388 --> 21:00.955
from Lola's account

21:00.998 --> 21:03.044
- and some other random account.
- What?

21:03.087 --> 21:05.916
Who would Lola send that
ridiculous amount of money to?

21:05.960 --> 21:08.092
Not Lola,
Sherri was the admin.

21:08.136 --> 21:09.572
She was in charge
of the petty cash

21:09.616 --> 21:11.357
for the whole campaign.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.315
Sherri would never
do something like that.

21:13.359 --> 21:15.099
Of course not,
but, Amy, this is all bad.

21:15.143 --> 21:17.580
Lola could get indicted if--

21:17.624 --> 21:19.756
- Don't say anything.
- Not on my life.

21:22.150 --> 21:25.022
Hey. Oh, my--

21:25.066 --> 21:27.895
Okay, so she's been
really trying,

21:27.938 --> 21:30.289
but she's not quite
fully potty trained.

21:30.332 --> 21:32.073
We got
potty training instructions

21:32.116 --> 21:33.596
and bedtime instructions.

21:33.640 --> 21:35.206
If you need anything,
give us a call.

21:35.250 --> 21:36.817
Won't be necessary.

21:36.860 --> 21:38.427
Bailey is number one fan
of her Uncle Mark,

21:38.471 --> 21:40.124
and whatever
I can't handle I know Amy can.

21:40.168 --> 21:41.996
We're so excited.

21:42.039 --> 21:43.606
Now, you guys go,
have a good time.

21:43.650 --> 21:45.042
We got this. Okay.

21:45.086 --> 21:46.870
She's in good hands.

21:46.914 --> 21:48.829
You take care
of your Uncle Mark, okay?

21:48.872 --> 21:50.134
She's got me.

21:50.178 --> 21:51.397
All right, go.
Get out of here.

21:51.440 --> 21:52.528
We got it.
We got it.

21:53.747 --> 21:55.314
Wait, you're telling me

21:55.357 --> 21:57.185
that your dad
is friends with Carver?

21:57.228 --> 21:58.621
I knew him
as Uncle Carver growing up.

21:58.665 --> 22:00.667
So my dad
also wanted to be a lawyer,

22:00.710 --> 22:03.844
but he dedicated his life
to me instead as a single dad.

22:04.453 --> 22:06.107
- He must be proud.
- Very.

22:06.150 --> 22:07.978
Now, what are we
really doing here?

22:10.241 --> 22:13.114
Okay, the deal
no longer works for my client.

22:13.157 --> 22:14.724
Charlotte
is a Canadian citizen.

22:14.768 --> 22:17.161
She has a green card,
and I totally missed it.

22:17.205 --> 22:18.902
Maybe you didn't.

22:18.946 --> 22:20.861
Clients lie
and hide things all the time.

22:21.905 --> 22:23.211
But don't be
too hard on yourself.

22:23.254 --> 22:24.691
I'm going to do
that for you

22:24.734 --> 22:26.388
if you don't come back
with a fair deal.

22:26.432 --> 22:28.651
I need to talk
to an immigration expert

22:28.695 --> 22:30.653
to find out
what charges my client

22:30.697 --> 22:32.089
can safely plead to
without suffering

22:32.133 --> 22:33.874
adverse
immigration consequences.

22:33.917 --> 22:35.876
I won't object
to a continuance.

22:35.919 --> 22:37.399
Thank you.

22:38.748 --> 22:40.663
I know you've been
objecting to this,

22:40.707 --> 22:42.361
but would you be
open to a sentence

22:42.404 --> 22:44.319
at the Women's Reentry Center
this time around?

22:44.363 --> 22:46.234
Absolutely not.
I'd rather go to trial.

22:46.277 --> 22:48.192
I need
an immigration safe deal.

22:48.236 --> 22:50.630
Look, I appreciate
this new approach, Emily.

22:50.673 --> 22:52.371
The drinks
and the casual chitchat.

22:52.414 --> 22:54.503
But I'm still
a prosecutor.

22:54.547 --> 22:56.375
I need a deal
that works for both of us.

23:00.509 --> 23:02.163
It's okay Bailey,

23:02.206 --> 23:04.165
I'm just
texting with Dad,

23:04.208 --> 23:05.862
we're just figuring
a few things out, that's all.

23:05.906 --> 23:08.169
Okay,
sending now, yeah.

23:08.822 --> 23:10.432
Hey, are you serious?
We used that--

23:10.476 --> 23:12.042
Do you have
a better idea?

23:12.086 --> 23:13.696
Because
I would love to hear it.

23:13.740 --> 23:15.219
Please, come over here
and enlighten me, Callan.

23:16.046 --> 23:17.134
You doing good.

23:17.831 --> 23:19.441
She's stressed out, right?

23:19.485 --> 23:22.313
Okay.
Never mind. No big deal.

23:22.357 --> 23:24.011
No big deal, right?

23:24.054 --> 23:25.447
It's our--

23:26.448 --> 23:28.581
Her dad texts
like my dad.

23:28.624 --> 23:30.278
Can you believe
David Sanders suggested

23:30.321 --> 23:31.758
that I fire Sherri?

23:31.801 --> 23:33.673
I mean,
are things really that bad?

23:33.716 --> 23:35.152
What am I missing?

23:45.249 --> 23:47.469
Sorry babe.
I got it.

23:48.339 --> 23:49.950
Okay.
We're doing great.

23:49.993 --> 23:51.604
You--
you're doing--

23:53.519 --> 23:55.216
Oh, my God, hey,
it's happening again.

23:55.259 --> 23:57.305
No, it's happening right now.
I need it.

23:57.348 --> 23:59.307
Hold on, I'm coming.

23:59.350 --> 24:01.091
Is she supposed to poop
through the thing?

24:01.135 --> 24:02.528
I don't think
she needs it anyway.

24:02.571 --> 24:04.617
Oh, my God.
What did she eat?

24:07.141 --> 24:08.795
Who the hell
keeps texting you?

24:08.838 --> 24:10.666
A mom from the park.

24:10.710 --> 24:12.712
Juan's mom,
little Juanito

24:12.755 --> 24:14.235
that Bailey plays with,
the little Mexican kid.

24:14.278 --> 24:15.715
A mom?

24:20.023 --> 24:21.460
I need a drink.

24:23.331 --> 24:24.463
Me too.

24:26.160 --> 24:28.292
She's finally asleep.

24:28.336 --> 24:30.556
This is great.
This is great?

24:30.599 --> 24:33.472
Mark, she ate,
like, 20 prunes.

24:33.515 --> 24:35.386
It's a high fiber diet.

24:35.430 --> 24:37.388
How did she even get to them?
It could've killed her.

24:37.432 --> 24:39.129
We almost killed
little Carmichael.

24:39.173 --> 24:40.435
I thought
it was normal.

24:41.567 --> 24:43.699
Can you
imagine this for us?

24:45.222 --> 24:48.095
Mark, I know you want Lola
to trust you with Bailey,

24:48.138 --> 24:49.705
but you need to tell her.

24:50.271 --> 24:52.142
You scared us,
little Carmichael.

24:52.186 --> 24:55.145
Yes, you did.
Yes, you did.

24:57.365 --> 24:59.802
This smells wonderful.

24:59.846 --> 25:01.456
We did great.

25:02.588 --> 25:04.241
- We?
- Who do you think

25:04.285 --> 25:05.765
made this delicious sauce?

25:08.681 --> 25:10.770
Why is a woman texting you
while we're trying

25:10.813 --> 25:12.598
- to have dinner?
- I'm sorry.

25:12.641 --> 25:14.600
And what the hell is she
texting you about this late?

25:14.643 --> 25:16.123
- She needed a--
- We're supposed to be having

25:16.166 --> 25:17.603
a romantic dinner
to ourselves.

25:17.646 --> 25:19.343
And I am worried
about Sherri

25:19.387 --> 25:21.563
and this hearing,
and it really hurts my feelings

25:21.607 --> 25:23.304
that I can't even
talk to you about it

25:23.347 --> 25:24.914
because you're too busy
texting Juanito's mom.

25:27.177 --> 25:28.352
It's Mark.

25:28.396 --> 25:29.658
What?

25:29.702 --> 25:30.790
I'm not texting a mom.

25:31.617 --> 25:33.444
Mark is struggling
with Bailey.

25:33.488 --> 25:35.882
He made me promise not to say
anything to you about it,

25:35.925 --> 25:37.492
because he really
wants you to trust him.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.059
- What's going on with Bailey?
- He said

25:39.102 --> 25:40.451
she ate something
that made her sick.

25:40.495 --> 25:42.453
He said she's asleep now,

25:42.497 --> 25:43.977
- but maybe we should--
- Yeah, we should go.

25:46.196 --> 25:47.633
Hi, mama.

25:47.676 --> 25:49.591
I know,
I know, I know.

25:49.635 --> 25:50.766
Okay.

25:53.682 --> 25:55.684
I'll get their stuff.

25:56.816 --> 25:58.121
Thank you.

26:01.168 --> 26:02.604
Look, I really hate

26:02.648 --> 26:04.345
that I can't
talk about this with Lo,

26:04.388 --> 26:06.826
but if it helps her
here's what you asked for.

26:06.869 --> 26:08.523
Sherri did
make the transfer?

26:08.567 --> 26:10.438
All information
about the receiving account

26:10.481 --> 26:11.744
is on the last page.

26:11.787 --> 26:12.919
That will
give you some answers.

26:14.137 --> 26:15.443
Where did
you get this?

26:15.486 --> 26:18.185
I didn't.
I never touched it.

26:30.110 --> 26:32.721
I'm told the defense
has new evidence.

26:32.765 --> 26:34.897
The people object,
Your Honor.

26:34.941 --> 26:36.725
This is late discovery.

26:36.769 --> 26:38.466
It's why I don't have
birthday parties.

26:38.509 --> 26:39.859
I hate surprises.

26:40.903 --> 26:42.775
Your Honor,
we are arguing

26:42.818 --> 26:45.168
a necessity defense
on behalf of our client.

26:45.212 --> 26:47.388
Kevin stole the rat
to save it

26:47.431 --> 26:50.086
from monstrous
experiments and abuse.

26:50.130 --> 26:51.566
You need to see it

26:51.610 --> 26:53.263
with your own
eyes to understand.

26:53.307 --> 26:54.700
Hang on, you're
bringing in the rat?

26:55.701 --> 26:57.311
Mr. Watkins,
you really lost it.

26:57.354 --> 26:58.791
You think the judge
will allow this?

26:59.792 --> 27:01.663
- I'll allow it.
- Excuse me?

27:01.707 --> 27:03.622
Bailiff,
bring in the rat.

27:07.626 --> 27:09.105
Here we go.

27:17.723 --> 27:19.159
Oh, no.

27:23.467 --> 27:24.860
Huh.

27:27.254 --> 27:29.299
Poor little thing.

27:32.563 --> 27:34.087
Do you need a moment,
Mr. Berger?

27:35.218 --> 27:37.873
I-- I do, Your Honor.

27:37.917 --> 27:39.658
Pardon me,
I-- I'm not sure

27:39.701 --> 27:40.789
what's
coming over me.

27:42.443 --> 27:44.097
I thought that
he wouldn't like the rat.

27:44.140 --> 27:47.404
Your Honor,
I am moving to dismiss

27:47.448 --> 27:48.928
in the interest
of justice.

27:53.933 --> 27:56.152
Thank you, Clayton.

27:56.675 --> 28:00.679
Berger. And I did not
do this for you, Mr. Watkins.

28:03.029 --> 28:04.421
Nice work Kevin.

28:06.641 --> 28:07.773
Good job, Olivia.

28:10.253 --> 28:11.733
Were you in charge

28:11.777 --> 28:13.213
of Judge Carmichael's
bank account?

28:13.256 --> 28:15.171
I was the admin, yes.

28:15.215 --> 28:17.826
That means
that every transaction movement

28:17.870 --> 28:19.654
- would have to go through you?
- Correct.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.787
What can you tell us
about the $500,000 transfer

28:21.830 --> 28:23.440
that was made
on July 13th?

28:24.354 --> 28:25.747
$500,000?

28:31.666 --> 28:33.320
This is the first time
I'm seeing this.

28:33.363 --> 28:35.452
Did anyone instruct you
to make that transfer?

28:35.496 --> 28:37.411
- Judge Carmichael perhaps?
- No.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.501
- No.
- So were you acting alone?

28:53.514 --> 28:55.037
I saw the files.

28:55.081 --> 28:57.083
So you saw
the evidence of the transfer.

28:57.910 --> 28:58.998
I would have
done the same...

29:00.216 --> 29:01.783
approving
the investigation.

29:03.132 --> 29:04.699
The Callan
version of an apology,

29:04.743 --> 29:06.135
ladies and gentlemen.

29:06.179 --> 29:08.094
I don't want
to know what that is.

29:08.137 --> 29:09.965
I told you that
if you used our resources--

29:10.009 --> 29:11.401
I didn't.

29:14.013 --> 29:15.492
The Justice Department?

29:15.536 --> 29:17.277
We need to submit
this as evidence.

29:34.729 --> 29:36.644
Did you
instruct Miss Kansky

29:36.687 --> 29:39.342
to make this transfer?

29:41.823 --> 29:43.433
Do you have
another campaign account

29:43.477 --> 29:45.044
that we don't
know about, Judge Carmichael?

29:45.087 --> 29:47.176
No, I do not.
Whose account is this?

29:47.220 --> 29:48.699
I don't know.

29:48.743 --> 29:49.831
When did you
instruct Miss Kansky

29:49.875 --> 29:51.441
to make the transfer?

29:51.485 --> 29:53.052
You already
asked that question

29:53.095 --> 29:54.749
and my answer
remains the same. I didn't.

29:56.795 --> 29:57.883
All right.

29:59.101 --> 30:00.799
Sounds like Miss Kansky

30:00.842 --> 30:02.409
was keeping you
in the dark.

30:02.452 --> 30:05.064
If she wasn't
instructed by you,

30:05.107 --> 30:07.980
who do you think
she was instructed by?

30:30.045 --> 30:31.699
Judge Carmichael,
could you step out

30:31.742 --> 30:32.874
for a moment, please?

30:50.500 --> 30:52.633
I spoke with some
immigration attorneys.

30:52.676 --> 30:54.504
They all agree
that I should ask

30:54.548 --> 30:57.812
the D.A. to let you plead
to a felony false imprisonment

30:57.856 --> 30:59.031
for a probation.

30:59.074 --> 31:00.423
False imprisonment?

31:00.467 --> 31:01.990
Yeah.
It's the safest choice.

31:02.034 --> 31:03.774
It won't get you
in trouble with immigration.

31:03.818 --> 31:06.212
And you would get
to spend most of your probation

31:06.255 --> 31:08.779
completing a program
here at the center.

31:08.823 --> 31:10.129
Oh, okay.

31:10.172 --> 31:12.044
I'll do whatever
you think is best.

31:12.087 --> 31:13.741
I trust you, Miss Lopez.

31:15.699 --> 31:19.703
Is there anything else
that you have not told me?

31:19.747 --> 31:22.271
No, and I
didn't lie to you.

31:22.315 --> 31:24.186
It's just--

31:24.230 --> 31:27.494
It's hard to keep up
with so much going on.

31:29.104 --> 31:31.977
I know it's--
it is a lot.

31:32.020 --> 31:35.197
I swear I didn't do
anything to Mrs. Neal.

31:35.241 --> 31:36.807
You should see

31:36.851 --> 31:38.200
the threatening
messages she's sent me.

31:38.244 --> 31:40.289
every time
I don't pay on the first.

31:40.333 --> 31:42.901
I do actually have
evidence to back that up.

31:42.944 --> 31:44.946
The burns she got
were very serious.

31:44.990 --> 31:47.079
And I know
if we didn't argue that night,

31:47.122 --> 31:48.254
this wouldn't
have happened.

31:49.603 --> 31:52.040
But I was the one
who took her to the hospital.

31:52.084 --> 31:55.261
I spent the night with her
and she still blames me.

32:12.408 --> 32:14.454
Thank you
for your patience.

32:14.497 --> 32:16.325
New evidence
was submitted

32:16.369 --> 32:18.675
and we needed time
to corroborate.

32:18.719 --> 32:21.113
The transfer was made
using this Kansky's log in,

32:21.156 --> 32:23.115
but it came
from a different IP address.

32:23.158 --> 32:24.725
We highly recommend
to heighten security

32:24.768 --> 32:26.379
to ensure
this doesn't happen again.

32:26.422 --> 32:29.251
For now, it's safe to say
that there is no evidence

32:29.295 --> 32:31.340
that suggests
election impropriety

32:31.384 --> 32:32.951
was committed
by either of you.

32:33.603 --> 32:36.519
But we do have a couple
more questions for you.

32:38.434 --> 32:41.481
What can you tell us
about David Sanders?

32:54.973 --> 32:57.627
Only three people had access
to this campaign account,

32:57.671 --> 33:00.021
Sherri, me and you.

33:00.065 --> 33:01.892
It's normal
campaign practice.

33:01.936 --> 33:04.025
Normal and illegal.

33:04.069 --> 33:06.506
I'll pay the fine
if it goes that far.

33:06.549 --> 33:08.116
Is that all
you have to say?

33:08.160 --> 33:10.292
Money's
moved around all the time.

33:10.336 --> 33:11.990
Only that this time
we had Karim Kuthbird

33:12.033 --> 33:13.252
sticking her nose
in our business.

33:13.295 --> 33:14.688
An I am glad that she did.

33:14.731 --> 33:16.429
I'll put
the money back right away.

33:16.472 --> 33:18.779
- No one even noticed.
- But somebody did notice.

33:20.041 --> 33:22.130
Sherri got
locked out of the account

33:22.174 --> 33:23.827
and thought
it was suspicious activity.

33:23.871 --> 33:25.351
And then
when she got back in,

33:25.394 --> 33:27.222
she just thought
it was a glitch.

33:27.266 --> 33:28.745
I'll apologize
to Miss Kansky myself.

33:28.789 --> 33:30.791
Your actions
override an apology.

33:30.834 --> 33:32.401
You were willing
to throw Sherri under the bus.

33:32.445 --> 33:33.750
If this evidence
hadn't come forward

33:33.794 --> 33:35.535
I could
have lost my seat.

33:35.578 --> 33:37.363
And the entire time
you sat up here advising us

33:37.406 --> 33:39.321
as if you had
no idea what was going on?

33:39.365 --> 33:42.107
It was never my intention
to get you in any trouble.

33:42.150 --> 33:43.760
I would never do
anything to hurt you.

33:43.804 --> 33:45.327
But you did.

33:46.024 --> 33:48.069
You and I are done.

33:50.332 --> 33:52.334
Now, get the hell
out of my chambers.

33:58.645 --> 34:00.473
I can't get on board
with false imprisonment.

34:00.516 --> 34:01.996
It doesn't
fit the facts.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.216
We all know
it is immigration safe.

34:04.259 --> 34:05.652
False imprisonment
and a sentence

34:05.695 --> 34:07.132
to the Women's Reentry Center.

34:07.175 --> 34:08.872
I wish
our American citizens

34:08.916 --> 34:10.483
can get this
kind of special treatment.

34:10.526 --> 34:12.398
Your Honor,
I have copies of text messages

34:12.441 --> 34:14.095
that prove
the alleged victim

34:14.139 --> 34:15.531
has been
threatening my client

34:15.575 --> 34:17.098
for a long time.

34:17.142 --> 34:18.491
I'm not
asking too much,

34:18.534 --> 34:20.536
considering
the circumstances.

34:20.580 --> 34:22.103
Sounds like
we should just try this case.

34:28.414 --> 34:30.198
As a former prosecutor,
I understand

34:30.242 --> 34:31.678
where you're
coming from Miss Foster,

34:31.721 --> 34:33.636
but after taking
a look at the work

34:33.680 --> 34:35.508
that the center does
and seeing the progress reports

34:35.551 --> 34:37.249
on the defendant,

34:37.292 --> 34:38.946
I believe this
is the right place for her.

34:38.989 --> 34:40.600
Your Honor, if I may--

34:40.643 --> 34:42.993
No, you may not, Miss Foster.
I'm not finished.

34:46.258 --> 34:47.824
If you reject
the counter offer

34:47.868 --> 34:49.783
and this case
proceeds to trial,

34:49.826 --> 34:52.220
I will almost certainly
sentence the defendant

34:52.264 --> 34:54.092
to the Women's Reentry Center
if she is found guilty.

34:54.135 --> 34:56.616
So you can choose,
if you would like

34:56.659 --> 34:58.139
to take the short
or the long route

34:58.183 --> 34:59.532
to the same result.

35:16.114 --> 35:17.376
I have been looking
everywhere for you.

35:17.419 --> 35:19.117
I was so worried.

35:19.160 --> 35:20.640
I apologize
for missing the hearing.

35:20.683 --> 35:22.120
Sherri, I think
that we should talk.

35:22.163 --> 35:23.991
Let's go grab
some dinner, drinks.

35:24.034 --> 35:25.601
Judge Carmichael,
I have come

35:25.645 --> 35:27.647
to appreciate my time
as your assistant.

35:27.690 --> 35:30.171
And I'd like
to inform you

35:30.215 --> 35:31.868
that I have put in
for my transfer request

35:31.912 --> 35:33.174
to Delgado's courtroom.

35:36.786 --> 35:39.180
Sherri, it's over now.

35:39.224 --> 35:41.574
I cut ties
with David Sanders.

35:41.617 --> 35:45.143
Glad, you did,
was that for me or for you?

35:49.059 --> 35:51.714
Look, I apologize

35:51.758 --> 35:53.803
if I gave you
the wrong impression,

35:53.847 --> 35:55.979
but I never
left you hanging.

35:56.023 --> 35:57.720
It felt
like you did.

35:57.764 --> 36:00.636
It is easy to show support
when things are over.

36:00.680 --> 36:02.072
I'm sorry.

36:02.116 --> 36:03.291
My mind
has been made it.

36:11.169 --> 36:13.954
To Luke,
for his valuable insight

36:13.997 --> 36:16.217
on the DA's office, cheers.

36:18.219 --> 36:21.004
Do you have any advice
on how to handle Maggie Palmer?

36:21.048 --> 36:23.050
I have a case with her
starting next week.

36:23.093 --> 36:25.226
Maggie hates
the smell of lavender.

36:25.270 --> 36:26.967
Do you have
a nice lavender perfume?

36:27.010 --> 36:29.012
Do I look like
I wear lavender perfume?

36:30.971 --> 36:33.365
Okay, well,
she loses patience

36:33.408 --> 36:35.062
when lawyers
take long pauses in court.

36:35.105 --> 36:37.195
You want her to flip,
pause, pause a lot.

36:41.634 --> 36:43.026
I can't believe we won.

36:44.593 --> 36:46.334
Well, I guess
this proves that two heads

36:46.378 --> 36:47.466
are better than one.

36:52.297 --> 36:54.342
I can't believe
Bailey ate all those prunes.

36:55.778 --> 36:57.824
I know
you didn't impress Lola

36:57.867 --> 36:59.478
like you had wanted

36:59.521 --> 37:01.697
but I'm sure
she'll give you another chance.

37:01.741 --> 37:03.656
I wasn't trying
to impress Lola, Bozo.

37:03.699 --> 37:05.092
I was trying
to impress you,

37:05.135 --> 37:07.312
show you
I could be a family man.

37:07.355 --> 37:10.315
Oh, slow
down there, mister.

37:10.358 --> 37:13.579
Amy,
can we please

37:13.622 --> 37:15.015
set a wedding date, please?

37:15.058 --> 37:17.017
I have to get
divorced first.

37:17.060 --> 37:18.845
The process takes time.

37:18.888 --> 37:21.761
I think this has been
taking abnormally long,

37:21.804 --> 37:23.458
don't you think?

37:23.502 --> 37:25.243
I told you,
everything's been signed.

37:25.286 --> 37:26.722
it is up
to the courts now.

37:26.766 --> 37:28.246
You promised
you'd be patient.

37:28.289 --> 37:29.638
I've been
insanely patient.

37:29.682 --> 37:31.510
- So have I.
- Oh.

37:31.553 --> 37:33.729
I'm on this waiting game
just as much as you are.

37:33.773 --> 37:34.948
All right.

37:34.991 --> 37:36.602
I'll leave it alone.

37:38.734 --> 37:40.301
It's not
just the wedding.

37:40.345 --> 37:43.130
I'm feeling pressure to--

37:45.175 --> 37:47.003
I see you
with Bailey and I--

37:47.047 --> 37:48.918
I'm afraid
you're going to...

37:48.962 --> 37:50.398
want to start
a family right away.

37:50.442 --> 37:52.270
And I'm not there yet.

37:54.837 --> 37:57.666
I want to marry you. I do.

37:58.450 --> 38:01.931
I just...
want to do it right.

38:01.975 --> 38:03.759
Without--
without rushing.

38:05.979 --> 38:07.067
Okay.

38:08.416 --> 38:09.809
We can take it slow.

38:11.027 --> 38:12.638
Real slow.

38:16.032 --> 38:17.643
We won't go to trial.

38:17.686 --> 38:20.602
And you can continue
your therapy here.

38:20.646 --> 38:22.169
Maybe when I get out,

38:22.212 --> 38:24.084
I'll enroll
in school, you know?

38:25.041 --> 38:26.129
Do something
with my life.

38:26.739 --> 38:28.001
Yeah.

38:29.394 --> 38:30.786
I'll come back
when the paperwork is ready

38:30.830 --> 38:31.961
for you to sign.

38:32.005 --> 38:33.136
Thanks Miss Lopez.

38:34.573 --> 38:36.183
Louise and Harry Collins.

38:36.966 --> 38:38.359
What's going on?
What's happening?

38:38.403 --> 38:40.056
You must be
Charlotte Collins.

38:40.100 --> 38:41.493
- What is going on?
- Please step aside, ma'am.

38:41.536 --> 38:43.321
What is going on?
Excuse me.

38:43.364 --> 38:44.757
I'm her lawyer,
can you please tell me

38:44.800 --> 38:46.280
- what is going on?
- I'm glad to hear

38:46.324 --> 38:47.847
she's got a lawyer.

38:47.890 --> 38:49.544
- She's going to need one.
- For what exactly?

38:49.588 --> 38:51.807
Excuse me,
you can't just take them.

38:51.851 --> 38:53.548
Ma'am, we are just
doing our job here.

38:53.592 --> 38:55.376
You can sort this out
in the family court case.

38:55.420 --> 38:57.422
Family court-- What?

38:57.465 --> 38:58.727
What family court case?

38:58.771 --> 39:00.120
What is she talking about?

39:00.163 --> 39:01.643
What is this?

39:01.687 --> 39:03.950
Mrs. Neal called
protective services.

39:03.993 --> 39:06.561
- When?
- Days after the accident.

39:07.519 --> 39:09.434
They came, they saw
that everything was fine.

39:09.477 --> 39:11.131
And I thought that was it.

39:11.174 --> 39:13.089
I didn't know they were still
looking into it.

39:13.133 --> 39:15.614
I can't lose my children
Miss Lopez. I can't.

39:15.657 --> 39:17.485
I know. Okay, okay.

39:17.529 --> 39:18.747
Please,
you got to help us.

39:18.791 --> 39:20.140
I will. I will. I will.

39:23.273 --> 39:24.971
Hello.

39:40.465 --> 39:43.032
I always hated
that I couldn't follow through

39:43.076 --> 39:44.382
with my clients after trial.

39:45.774 --> 39:47.167
But now
that I can it's--

39:47.210 --> 39:49.561
No, no, no.
It's going to take time.

39:50.300 --> 39:52.302
God, we're both

39:52.346 --> 39:54.261
on a little uncharted
territory right now,

39:54.304 --> 39:56.089
but we have each other

39:56.132 --> 39:59.484
and I have
a lot of wine

39:59.527 --> 40:01.442
to get through
so, you stay here

40:01.486 --> 40:02.791
with me tonight, okay?

40:02.835 --> 40:04.402
It's not even
a question, okay?

40:05.228 --> 40:06.491
Yeah.

40:06.534 --> 40:08.014
Here.

40:10.712 --> 40:14.020
You know what?
I blame you for this, okay?

40:14.063 --> 40:16.501
Because you didn't tell me
you were coming back,

40:16.544 --> 40:19.591
and now I'm roommates
with a magician.

40:21.636 --> 40:23.246
Of course you are.

40:23.290 --> 40:25.292
Oh, you-- yeah.
You think you're funny?
