00:13.827 --> 00:16.736
- Save me, Finn and Jake.
- Shh!

00:17.286 --> 00:20.317
- Save me, Finn and Jake.
- We are.

00:21.715 --> 00:25.190
- Save me, Finn and Jake.
- Why does she keep saying that?

00:25.650 --> 00:27.590
I think she's traumatized, dude.

00:27.715 --> 00:30.197
Don't worry, princess.
We're gonna get you out of here.

00:35.229 --> 00:37.583
What was that?
Darling, are you all right?

00:37.708 --> 00:38.915
I thought I heard a...

00:44.441 --> 00:45.837
Oh, I see what happened.

00:46.003 --> 00:47.317
She broke up with me.

00:47.933 --> 00:49.950
Well, it's your mistake, missy!

00:50.075 --> 00:52.037
This ice king's gonna be fine!

00:54.870 --> 00:56.784
Why did she leave?

00:56.909 --> 01:00.157
I put so much cool stuff
in her little prison!

01:00.641 --> 01:02.348
Come on, old boy, keep it together.

01:04.144 --> 01:05.397
Maybe she called me!

01:07.150 --> 01:08.357
Please, please, please.

01:12.655 --> 01:14.077
No, no messages!

01:22.839 --> 01:25.541
This is where
she used to do her business.

01:27.856 --> 01:31.077
I'm so tired of looking at this face.

01:38.625 --> 01:39.712
Not bad.

01:39.944 --> 01:42.237
And now for some healthy exercise.

01:43.203 --> 01:45.970
I'm forgetting
about that silly old break-up already.

01:53.545 --> 01:55.563
All right, let's fly!

01:57.748 --> 02:00.797
You fool, you can't fly
without your beard.

02:01.212 --> 02:04.077
- I'm going to be alone forever.
- Hi!

02:06.038 --> 02:07.956
Beautiful princess.

02:08.419 --> 02:12.317
Excuse me for approaching you, sir,
you just seemed so approachable.

02:14.603 --> 02:17.409
That's funny,
usually my looks put people off.

02:20.448 --> 02:22.437
Is someone paying you to do this?

02:23.679 --> 02:24.957
Tell me about yourself.

02:25.352 --> 02:28.979
Well, there's not much to tell, really.
I'm an ice king.

02:30.023 --> 02:31.077
A nice king.

02:32.449 --> 02:34.647
No, no, dear, you misheard me.

02:34.893 --> 02:37.157
I'm not a nice king, I'm...

02:39.043 --> 02:41.707
... a really nice king.

02:42.315 --> 02:43.349
And I'm single.

02:45.897 --> 02:46.944
Oh, my gosh!

02:49.747 --> 02:52.168
Yeah, guess what.
Slime Princess is in the park.

02:52.293 --> 02:54.412
And she's like,
talk to a new nice king

02:55.098 --> 02:56.915
And he's like totally single.

02:57.683 --> 02:59.580
By the way, don't tell anybody.

03:09.807 --> 03:11.268
And I was like "Leave him alone!".

03:11.393 --> 03:13.397
And he was like "Make me!".
And I was like "Okay!".

03:13.563 --> 03:15.237
And then he was like "Arg! My head!".

03:16.689 --> 03:18.877
- Dude, what are you doing?
- I try to get signal.

03:19.260 --> 03:21.637
It's like everyone in Ooo
is on their phone or something.

03:22.420 --> 03:23.277
Oh, man!

03:24.401 --> 03:27.517
Have you, guys,...
seen the new... nice king?

03:27.683 --> 03:28.477
Nice king?

03:28.859 --> 03:30.752
- Yeah!
- He's single.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.020
And he's our.

03:32.145 --> 03:33.237
Now, get out of our way!

03:36.881 --> 03:39.905
Man! Now we have to kick
that frog out of his new home.

03:40.030 --> 03:41.307
Nah. Let him keep it.

03:42.202 --> 03:45.756
If there's a new king and he's nice,
we should offer our services.

03:45.989 --> 03:47.776
Finn and Jake-style.

03:50.432 --> 03:54.097
Ladies, I'll have time
to meet you individually later.

03:54.222 --> 03:55.997
Please, just stop squirming.

03:56.622 --> 03:59.028
But this looks like a prison.

03:59.632 --> 04:01.581
Pris... don't be ridiculous.

04:01.835 --> 04:04.053
It's a waiting room.
Just stop squirming

04:04.178 --> 04:05.077
Nice king!

04:06.642 --> 04:09.099
Finn and Jake.
You'll never take me alive!

04:10.890 --> 04:12.397
You're the nice king, right?

04:12.789 --> 04:15.037
Oh, yeah. I keep forgetting that.

04:15.669 --> 04:19.077
- Well, we will honor and serve you.
- Serve me?

04:19.454 --> 04:21.357
Yeah, we want to be
your nice knights.

04:25.227 --> 04:27.197
That sounds nice!

04:27.714 --> 04:29.597
With my rod of niceness,

04:29.763 --> 04:32.597
I dub thee two my nice knights.

04:33.031 --> 04:34.503
Yeah! We're knights!

04:34.833 --> 04:35.848
Nice!

04:36.249 --> 04:38.011
Who do you want us
to nice-knights against?

04:38.136 --> 04:40.654
- Nice king, I love you!
- Did I tell you that I like the opera?

04:40.779 --> 04:41.917
But if you don't, I hate it!

04:43.267 --> 04:44.117
Please!

04:44.283 --> 04:46.477
I'm trying to tell
my nice knights something!

04:50.233 --> 04:51.037
Come here.

04:51.599 --> 04:53.957
The main enemy
to the nice king right now

04:54.687 --> 04:56.917
is the disorganization
of his love life.

04:57.345 --> 04:58.517
Well, what do you mean?

04:58.868 --> 05:01.568
The ugly ones are all mixed up
with the other ones!

05:01.693 --> 05:03.637
I need you to catalog them
or something.

05:05.061 --> 05:06.437
But we punch monsters.

05:06.937 --> 05:10.237
After I choose my bride,
then you can go punch the monsters.

05:10.724 --> 05:13.815
Managing admirers?
We'll give it a try.

05:14.178 --> 05:15.677
Let's move on to something easier.

05:16.878 --> 05:19.877
- Do you like drums?
- Am I supposed to?

05:20.221 --> 05:21.277
She's dodging the question.

05:23.694 --> 05:26.117
Are you fond of men
with magical abilities?

05:26.494 --> 05:29.117
I'm really nervous right now.
I just really want to meet a nice king.

05:29.615 --> 05:31.517
You can go back
to the waiting room now, ma'am!

05:32.058 --> 05:33.477
I screwed it up, didn't I?

05:35.260 --> 05:36.606
I think we did a good job.

05:36.731 --> 05:38.957
I don't feel good making
a princess cry.

05:39.308 --> 05:41.277
This is not how
knights are supposed to act.

05:41.735 --> 05:43.637
Finn, knights are
loyal to their king.

05:44.361 --> 05:45.742
I'm still not sure.

05:46.747 --> 05:49.082
- Loyalty to the king.
- Can't argue with that.

05:49.207 --> 05:50.437
Hey, nice knights,

05:50.949 --> 05:53.944
turtle princess is about to walk out
that door.

05:54.069 --> 05:55.708
I told her that I like her a lot,

05:55.833 --> 05:57.637
but I really don't like her
all that much.

05:58.057 --> 05:59.803
Could you guys break it off for me?

06:01.620 --> 06:04.422
The nice king is not looking
for a relationship right now.

06:04.547 --> 06:05.661
Get out of here!

06:07.892 --> 06:09.806
He's just not ready
for a relationship!

06:09.931 --> 06:11.897
All right! We did it, dude!

06:13.442 --> 06:16.157
I feel terrible. I need to talk
to the nice king about this.

06:16.737 --> 06:19.935
Yes, yes, keep walking in a circle.

06:20.974 --> 06:22.997
Nice king,
may I speak with you for a moment?

06:23.570 --> 06:26.892
Princesses,
I must speak to my knight in private.

06:27.017 --> 06:30.538
- Go on, back into your cage.
- Bye, nice king!

06:30.839 --> 06:31.877
What's up, knight?

06:32.411 --> 06:34.338
I don't like treating princesses
this way.

06:34.463 --> 06:36.717
I don't want to...
I don't want to do this anymore.

06:37.262 --> 06:39.557
Your loyalty is in question?

06:39.859 --> 06:40.837
It's not that.

06:41.003 --> 06:43.957
It's just, princesses are supposed
to be treated with niceness.

06:44.489 --> 06:48.035
Are you implying
that I'm not the nice king?

06:48.160 --> 06:49.077
What's wrong with you?

06:50.923 --> 06:51.957
Hey, I'm here!

06:53.153 --> 06:56.077
- Finn, get rid of her.
- What? No, man!

06:56.506 --> 06:58.857
She's too loud and lumpy.

06:58.982 --> 07:01.971
I like smooth princesses, smooth.

07:03.083 --> 07:04.077
I can be smooth.

07:08.003 --> 07:09.797
Finn, punch out my lumps.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.837
I can be whatever he wants.

07:12.308 --> 07:14.917
- I can change!
- I can't punch a princess!

07:16.323 --> 07:17.507
Finn, just punch her!

07:17.749 --> 07:20.237
Let me see what
she looks like smooth.

07:22.248 --> 07:23.397
Yes! Hit me!

07:27.346 --> 07:30.613
I'm sorry, lumpy space princess.
I just can't punch you.

07:30.854 --> 07:33.465
Are you serious?
Fine. I'll do it myself.

07:34.715 --> 07:36.797
- Princess, no!
- Wait a minute, nice knight.

07:36.963 --> 07:39.173
Let's see what she can do.

07:39.872 --> 07:41.117
There. How's that?

07:41.922 --> 07:42.947
Better?

07:44.347 --> 07:46.117
No, I don't like her.

07:46.480 --> 07:48.437
This is all your fault, Finn!

07:50.602 --> 07:52.917
King, I'm sorry.
I just can't do this anymore.

07:53.385 --> 07:56.557
Punching princesses, breaking hearts,
it doesn't seem nice at all.

07:57.738 --> 07:59.884
You're on thin ice, nice knight!

08:01.708 --> 08:03.317
- The jig is up!
- What jig?

08:05.222 --> 08:07.518
My jig is up high.

08:07.643 --> 08:09.158
It's a highland jig.

08:09.773 --> 08:11.851
I have a new assignment for you,

08:11.976 --> 08:15.277
one with more knight-related stuff,
very important.

08:16.430 --> 08:17.677
Awesome! What is it?

08:18.187 --> 08:20.880
The ice king stole my razor.

08:21.005 --> 08:24.117
Sneak into his trap-filled ice castle
and retrieve it.

08:24.283 --> 08:26.022
And don't look through
the shoe box that he keeps

08:26.147 --> 08:27.637
behind the laundry bag in the closet.

08:27.803 --> 08:28.957
Those are my orders!

08:29.354 --> 08:31.477
Yes! Finally something knight-like!

08:32.096 --> 08:35.557
Get ready, ice king, for battle!

08:35.999 --> 08:38.145
And once I have my razor,

08:38.270 --> 08:43.076
I can select my elite army of wives
and take over the world!

08:48.923 --> 08:50.385
Look at all his hair.

08:50.510 --> 08:52.357
Did the ice king shave his back
or something?

08:54.841 --> 08:56.249
The nice king's razor!

08:57.363 --> 08:58.517
Jake, look, check this out.

08:59.990 --> 09:01.650
Relax, dude. It's just me.

09:02.238 --> 09:04.837
You look just like the ice king.
And so do i.

09:06.109 --> 09:08.517
These whiskers would make
anyone look like the ice king.

09:09.402 --> 09:11.237
Yeah, even the nice king.

09:12.902 --> 09:15.397
The nice king is the ice king!

09:16.623 --> 09:19.835
What do those princesses see
in this face?

09:19.960 --> 09:23.771
Hope I can keep this going.
So many princesses to meet.

09:24.626 --> 09:25.627
Whiskers!

09:26.283 --> 09:28.029
I can't be growing whiskers now!

09:29.712 --> 09:31.535
I haven't picked
who I want to marry me!

09:31.660 --> 09:32.557
Nice king!

09:33.627 --> 09:35.277
Did you retrieve my stolen razor?

09:35.841 --> 09:37.741
Yeah, and also, this!

09:38.342 --> 09:41.157
My beard! I mean, what is that?

09:41.703 --> 09:44.273
- He knows what it is.
- Let's get him, Jake!

09:44.934 --> 09:46.797
We're not gonna let you beat up
the nice king.

09:47.161 --> 09:48.917
He's not the nice king!
He's the ice king!

09:49.083 --> 09:50.766
- We don't believe you!
- Man!

09:50.891 --> 09:52.625
These ladies really want
to get married.

09:52.750 --> 09:54.710
Jake, we can't beat up princesses!

09:55.093 --> 09:57.037
Relax, dude.
Just get behind my ear shield.

10:10.457 --> 10:12.917
- Wait, I can't fly!
- Let me help you!

10:16.338 --> 10:17.197
No! Wait!

10:20.069 --> 10:21.627
Now fly, you liar!

10:27.752 --> 10:31.437
Ladies, ladies,
I can shave it off again.

10:31.931 --> 10:34.473
And when you get fat,
I'll grow it back.

10:38.828 --> 10:41.144
Now that's what I call a close shave.
