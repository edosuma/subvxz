00:39.707 --> 00:42.810
-What else did we get?
KEM: Another book...

00:42.843 --> 00:45.179
...from...

00:45.213 --> 00:48.416
...Elizabeth Corday.
Elizabeth. Who's that?

00:48.449 --> 00:50.651
Surgeon. British.

00:53.587 --> 00:55.489
The American Way of Birth.

00:55.523 --> 00:57.658
Don't let Dr. Ford
catch you reading that.

00:57.691 --> 00:59.460
Oh, yeah? Why not?

00:59.493 --> 01:02.496
Because it argues that the shift
from home births and midwives...

01:02.530 --> 01:06.767
...to hospital births and
C-sections is the result
of American OBs' greed.

01:09.503 --> 01:12.806
-All right, what do you think?
-I'll read it today.

01:12.840 --> 01:15.876
-No, about the paint.
-Oh....

01:15.909 --> 01:19.547
Maybe something with more blue.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.415
Maybe?

01:21.449 --> 01:25.519
You know, Americans are way too
neurotic and technology-reliant.

01:25.553 --> 01:28.556
I mean, with all your money
and equipment...

01:28.589 --> 01:31.525
...your infant mortality rate
is still terrible.

01:31.559 --> 01:35.196
Oh, you'd rather be back in
Kivu, giving birth on a concrete
floor?

01:35.229 --> 01:37.731
You're, like, 34th or something,
behind Guam.

01:39.700 --> 01:42.836
I like the second one.

01:42.870 --> 01:45.373
Mm. Too much gray.

01:45.406 --> 01:47.675
Well, why don't we ask George?

01:47.708 --> 01:50.311
-Oh. George?
-You don't like George?

01:50.344 --> 01:52.746
-Oh, please.
-I like George.

01:52.780 --> 01:57.185
It's the name of first president
of the United States, the quiet
Beatle.

01:57.218 --> 01:58.752
The current occupant
of the White House.

01:58.786 --> 02:01.222
Well, no name is perfect.
Hey, George.

02:01.255 --> 02:03.191
It's Dad.

02:03.191 --> 02:05.193
Say, listen,
would you rather be born...

02:05.226 --> 02:07.828
...on the filthy dirt floor
of a primitive mud hut...

02:07.861 --> 02:08.929
...in Central Africa, or--?

02:08.961 --> 02:11.265
I do not live in a mud hut.

02:11.299 --> 02:14.468
Or in a modern hospital...

02:14.502 --> 02:18.772
...surrounded by the finest
doctors and equipment in the
world?

02:18.806 --> 02:22.610
Kick once for America,
twice for the mud hut.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.445
I resent your characterization--

02:24.478 --> 02:26.547
Shh. He's deciding.

02:26.580 --> 02:29.217
-He's not deciding.
-He's deciding.

02:29.217 --> 02:30.851
-You know what, he's sleeping.
-No.

02:36.724 --> 02:40.594
-I'm back.
-Hey, you get there in time?

02:40.628 --> 02:43.431
Yeah. It's a nice-looking
school.

02:43.464 --> 02:46.234
It's kind of
heavy-duty security, though.

02:46.234 --> 02:49.303
They have a drug shootout there
recently or something?

02:51.872 --> 02:55.676
What the hell is this?

02:55.709 --> 02:57.745
Honey, you knew what that was
when I met you at 15.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.713
Where did he get it?

02:59.747 --> 03:02.483
He saw it with my stuff, and he
wanted to know what it was.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.585
So you gave it to him?

03:04.618 --> 03:06.254
He knows not to take it
to school.

03:06.287 --> 03:07.588
A condom?

03:07.621 --> 03:09.723
Hey, look.
Come on, I'm sorry, all right?

03:09.757 --> 03:13.494
It's no big deal. I shouldn't
have had the thing in my damn
pocket.

03:13.527 --> 03:16.397
Picked up a few, just in case.

03:16.430 --> 03:18.466
You're not on the pill right
now, right?

03:18.499 --> 03:20.401
Me?

03:20.434 --> 03:23.271
A boy can dream, can't he?

03:23.304 --> 03:24.972
You look good, baby.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.375
I missed you.

03:29.877 --> 03:32.846
-What are you doing?
-What you like.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.749
It's still what you like,
isn't it?

03:35.783 --> 03:37.951
No. I gotta go finish laundry.

03:41.422 --> 03:45.659
Hey, can you hang with Alex
tonight? I got something I gotta
do.

03:45.693 --> 03:47.328
A date?

03:48.729 --> 03:50.631
Yeah, sure.

03:52.300 --> 03:54.602
I can't believe we graduate
tomorrow.

03:54.635 --> 03:57.805
Neither can future patients.
Today, ill-prepared students.

03:57.838 --> 04:01.542
Tomorrow, doctors with the fate
of countless helpless victims...

04:01.575 --> 04:02.843
...in incapable hands.

04:02.876 --> 04:04.978
They ought to make them
wear caution signs.

04:05.012 --> 04:07.481
"Danger: New Doc"
in big letters on your coats.

04:07.515 --> 04:08.882
Thanks for the pep talk.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.818
Happy to lend encouragement
to the newbies.

04:10.851 --> 04:11.852
-Jerk.
-Bastard.

04:11.885 --> 04:13.621
Putz.

04:13.654 --> 04:14.988
How long will it take me to
get to O'Hare at midnight?

04:15.022 --> 04:17.325
Midnight?

04:17.325 --> 04:19.327
My family's arriving
from London. I had to get
the cheapest flight.

04:19.327 --> 04:20.394
How many are coming?

04:20.428 --> 04:22.596
-Nineteen.
-How many?

04:22.630 --> 04:25.566
Really. Eighteen if my uncle's
hip is still dodgy.
Your families coming?

04:25.599 --> 04:27.868
Father and mother,
Dad's new wife, Mom's new boy--

04:27.901 --> 04:32.573
-Abby, any family jetting in?
-No. We're not that close.

04:32.606 --> 04:36.043
We're more like survivors
of a particularly brutal
carjacking than a family.

04:36.076 --> 04:39.513
Hello, ladies. Let's get a move
on. It's your last chance...

04:39.547 --> 04:44.051
...to learn something before you
start screwing up your
malpractice premiums.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.619
-Wanker.
-Turd.

04:45.653 --> 04:46.654
Dick.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.107
-Is Alex coming with us?
-No.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.709
It'd be fine with me if he did.

05:41.742 --> 05:44.645
-Just you and me.
-Where do you wanna go?

05:44.678 --> 05:47.548
Just hang out. I miss you.

05:50.751 --> 05:53.687
Eighty-five-year-old male,
combative and uncooperative...

05:53.721 --> 05:55.789
...wandering around naked
at board and care.

05:55.823 --> 05:59.026
Give me my watch back, you
bastards!

05:59.059 --> 06:02.095
EMT: Thinks we took his watch.
-I want it back, son of a bitch!

06:02.129 --> 06:03.664
It's on his wrist.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.666
SAM: You want restraints?
-Not yet.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.735
CBC, chem panel, UA and chest
x-ray.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.603
Somebody call the cops.

06:09.637 --> 06:12.506
And let's see if we can find
a reason for his deterioration.

06:12.540 --> 06:14.141
SAM:
Hey, back so soon?

06:14.174 --> 06:17.445
-Lucky me, huh?
KOVAC: Abby, you free?

06:17.445 --> 06:19.947
What, everybody just decide
to not file anything for two
months?

06:19.980 --> 06:24.585
Frank, my man. Ha-ha!
Thank God you're back.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.854
You start blubbering, I swear
I'm gonna smack you.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.823
-Back to work already?
-Wife threw me out of the house.

06:29.857 --> 06:33.060
I think I was getting on her
nerves. She was definitely
getting on mine.

06:59.887 --> 07:01.755
-John?
-Yeah.

07:01.789 --> 07:03.824
God, how long have I been
asleep?

07:03.857 --> 07:06.527
About an hour.

07:06.560 --> 07:09.930
-Here, drink this.
-No, thanks.

07:09.963 --> 07:12.900
-No, really, I don't want it.
-Come on, come on, come on.

07:15.703 --> 07:17.838
You been doing your kick counts?

07:17.871 --> 07:20.240
What? No.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.810
The baby squirms like mad all
the time.

07:24.545 --> 07:27.548
You've been reading too many
books.

07:27.581 --> 07:29.583
I'll count, okay?

07:29.617 --> 07:32.586
Just go do something useful.
Unpack a box, paint,
do something.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.622
-Go, go.
-Okay, okay.

07:38.258 --> 07:40.928
Dr. Pratt, remember that kid
with high blood pressure last
week?

07:40.961 --> 07:43.030
-Nope.
-Burnt his hands on a grill?

07:43.063 --> 07:46.767
His belly CT came back. No pheo,
no coarc, no renal artery
stenosis.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.002
Nothing indicates cause
for high blood pressure.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.538
-So?
-He has primary hypertension.

07:50.538 --> 07:52.940
What? That big kid
who flips burgers?

07:52.973 --> 07:54.575
What'd you tell him on
discharge?

07:54.608 --> 07:56.243
To lose weight,
get some exercise.

07:56.276 --> 07:58.579
Gave him a scrip
for hydrochlorothiazide.

07:58.612 --> 08:00.714
And referred him
to Family Medicine Clinic.

08:00.748 --> 08:04.918
-VoilÃ . You're a miracle worker.
-Look at his cardiac echo.

08:04.952 --> 08:07.555
-Left ventricular hypertrophy.
-You call the clinic?

08:07.555 --> 08:09.890
-He hasn't made an appointment.
-Call and remind him.

08:09.923 --> 08:12.993
He has end-organ damage.
He could have CHF or arrhythmia.

08:13.026 --> 08:15.796
Neela, he's a kid, okay?
That would take decades.

08:15.829 --> 08:20.568
Call him, tell him to get his
butt to the clinic sometime
before he's 30.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.972
No fever, no pneumonia, no UTI.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.608
-Something metabolic?
-Pulse ox is 98.

08:27.641 --> 08:30.978
Sodium's okay. Sugar's normal.
No anion gap.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.046
Mr. Ferguson, you have
to stay in bed.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.982
I have to go feed the cat.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.784
We'll make sure the cat's taken
care of, but you have to
stay in bed.

08:37.818 --> 08:40.621
-What else?
-Uh, could be toxic ingestion...

08:40.654 --> 08:44.592
...but there's no toxidrome. I
think it's just a worsening of
his dementia.

08:44.625 --> 08:48.228
Five hundred cc saline bolus
and D5 half at 100 an hour?

08:48.261 --> 08:51.031
Yep. You graduate tomorrow?

08:51.064 --> 08:54.835
-Eight short years later, yeah.
-Got your boards results yet?

08:54.868 --> 08:56.103
No.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.705
MORRIS: Dr. Kovac, you got a
minute?

08:57.738 --> 08:59.239
They gonna let you graduate?

08:59.272 --> 09:02.309
I can walk, but I don't get my
diploma until I pass.

09:02.342 --> 09:05.613
You haven't passed your boards
yet?

09:05.613 --> 09:07.147
I took them last week.

09:07.180 --> 09:10.217
Wow, I had to take mine, like,
six months before my graduation.

09:10.250 --> 09:13.220
Morris, what do you need?

09:13.253 --> 09:17.758
Hey, Malik. Can you hang 500
saline
for the old guy in Exam 3?

09:17.791 --> 09:20.060
-You got it.
-Dr. Corday is a surgeon.

09:20.093 --> 09:21.762
She'd be on the sixth floor.

09:21.795 --> 09:23.831
I went there first.
They told me to come here.

09:23.864 --> 09:26.867
-Yeah? Well, they were wrong.
-Rachel?

09:26.900 --> 09:29.903
-Jerry, how've you been?
-Oh, my God. Look at you.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.238
You're all grown up.

09:31.271 --> 09:33.941
Frank, you remember
Rachel, right?

09:33.974 --> 09:36.043
Rachel Greene.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.145
-Dr. Greene's daughter.
FRANK: Oh!

09:38.178 --> 09:41.949
No bleeding, right, and no
contractions? Nothing hurts?

09:41.982 --> 09:44.051
Hey, slow down, honey.
You're scaring me.

09:44.084 --> 09:47.054
Did your membranes rupture?
Could've happened in the shower.

09:47.087 --> 09:50.123
I saw Dr. Ford yesterday,
and the membranes are fine.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.894
Hey, you can't park here.

09:53.927 --> 09:57.397
-It's okay. I'm a doctor.
-Good for you. You gotta move
it.

09:57.430 --> 10:00.801
It's a tow-away zone!

10:00.834 --> 10:02.402
All right, thank you.

10:02.435 --> 10:06.073
When he does come in, would you
get him to call me back, please?

10:06.106 --> 10:08.275
Thanks. Bloody hell.

10:08.308 --> 10:11.078
"Bloody hell" already?
It's not even lunchtime.

10:11.111 --> 10:14.715
I'm trying to find a
hypertensive 17-year-old with
end-organ damage.

10:14.748 --> 10:17.284
No answer at home.
Hasn't turned up for work,
either.

10:17.317 --> 10:20.220
Organ damage in a hypertensive
teenager? Is that even possible?

10:22.122 --> 10:24.324
Anybody know whose patient that
is?

10:24.357 --> 10:26.193
Mine.

10:26.226 --> 10:29.897
Malik. Larry Godiva's taking
another afternoon stroll. Thank
you.

10:29.930 --> 10:32.399
One of you Samantha Taggart?

10:32.432 --> 10:34.768
-You a process server?
-No.

10:34.802 --> 10:36.937
Then that's me.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.907
Better eat them quick.
They gonna start melting soon.

10:39.940 --> 10:42.309
-Ice cream?
-Anybody want a sundae?

10:42.342 --> 10:44.044
Somebody sent you ice cream?

10:47.047 --> 10:49.282
Yeah, she's here right now.

10:49.316 --> 10:52.886
Uh, with a boy, yeah.

10:52.920 --> 10:55.222
BJ. Right, okay.

10:56.189 --> 10:58.358
All right, thanks, bye.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.065
-I called your mother.
-How is she?

11:05.098 --> 11:08.268
She's surprised you're here.

11:08.301 --> 11:11.972
BJ, could you give us
a few minutes, please?

11:12.005 --> 11:17.077
Cafeteria's on the first floor.
Could you get me some fries,
Diet Coke?

11:17.110 --> 11:18.779
Cool.

11:18.812 --> 11:21.749
-You good?
-Yeah, fine, thanks.

11:23.884 --> 11:26.920
So your mother tells me that
you're not living at home
anymore.

11:26.954 --> 11:28.756
Moved in with a friend
from school.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.758
Living with her family?

11:30.758 --> 11:33.026
No, got our own place.
How's Ella? Can't wait to see
her--

11:33.060 --> 11:35.362
Excuse me, Elizabeth.
Can I borrow you for a moment?

11:35.395 --> 11:37.831
Yeah. I'll be right back.

11:37.865 --> 11:41.068
I've got a bad mesenteric
occlusion. May need the O.R.

11:41.101 --> 11:43.170
Fine, sure.

11:43.203 --> 11:46.206
I got those Itzhak Perlman
tickets for Sunday.

11:46.239 --> 11:49.076
-Shaw's first?
-Right, yeah, yeah.

11:49.109 --> 11:51.912
-Where'd you say the patient
was?
-Angiography suite.

11:51.945 --> 11:55.115
I'll be right there.

11:55.148 --> 11:57.517
Um, I'm sorry, Rachel.
I have to get back to work.

11:57.550 --> 12:00.087
Who was that?

12:00.120 --> 12:03.090
-Colleague, Dr. Lawson.
-Handsome.

12:03.123 --> 12:06.359
-So we can stay with you, right?
-How long for?

12:06.393 --> 12:12.199
Couple of days. I wanted to
check out U of I, maybe
Northwestern.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.167
You know you're always welcome.

12:16.403 --> 12:20.240
-Separate bedrooms, of course.
-Of course.

12:23.543 --> 12:25.813
I was 15 when we met.

12:25.846 --> 12:28.248
