01:10.518 --> 01:13.142
- My name is Tom
Keating and I want

01:13.176 --> 01:15.178
to give the world
a wake up call.

01:16.421 --> 01:18.768
We are in grave grave danger.

01:19.907 --> 01:22.910
There is a looming
threat to every woman,

01:22.944 --> 01:25.430
man, and child on Earth today.

01:26.845 --> 01:30.020
And if we don't acknowledge
and confront this menace

01:31.229 --> 01:33.231
our civilization may be doomed.

01:34.749 --> 01:38.339
The source of this information
comes from the memoirs

01:39.375 --> 01:42.205
of a Man in Black.

01:51.663 --> 01:54.666
The memoir names names,
important people.

01:54.700 --> 01:56.978
A lot of them in
high level positions.

01:57.013 --> 02:00.879
If they find out about this
and my crusade to warn mankind

02:00.913 --> 02:02.432
they're going to do
everything they can

02:02.467 --> 02:04.158
to stop me from
making them public.

02:06.160 --> 02:08.473
If the information doesn't
get out for the world to see

02:08.507 --> 02:11.200
and take seriously it's
going to be too late.

02:12.615 --> 02:15.065
All I can say is I'm
scared to death about it.

02:15.100 --> 02:16.481
I love my country.

02:16.515 --> 02:20.347
This is my patriotic
duty I've got to do this.

02:20.381 --> 02:24.040
And besides at my age I've
lived most of my life.

02:24.074 --> 02:28.113
I can take this chance,
the hell with it.

02:31.910 --> 02:35.638
My name's Tom Keating and I'm
originally from New York City.

02:35.672 --> 02:38.848
I went to Pace University
and after that I

02:38.882 --> 02:41.264
spent four years in the Marine
Corps, I'm a Vietnam vet.

02:41.299 --> 02:44.267
And here I'm in North
Hollywood and now I'm retired.

02:44.302 --> 02:46.407
Joe and I had a lot in common.

02:46.442 --> 02:48.789
He was retired, I was retired.

02:48.823 --> 02:52.206
We didn't have kids,
no close relatives.

02:52.241 --> 02:55.175
Joe was a recluse but
even so he started

02:55.209 --> 02:57.004
to open up and confide in me.

02:57.038 --> 02:59.213
I got to think of him
more as a brother than

02:59.248 --> 03:01.664
anything else and we
became kindred spirits

03:01.698 --> 03:05.219
Joe was diagnosed with
brain cancer in 2013.

03:05.254 --> 03:06.910
And after he was
diagnosed with that

03:06.945 --> 03:09.844
he invites me up to his
room, wants to talk to me.

03:09.879 --> 03:12.399
I go up there and he
starts talking about

03:12.433 --> 03:15.160
how he worked for
the super secret

03:15.195 --> 03:19.716
government agency back 1970's
or something like that.

03:20.855 --> 03:23.099
He referred to himself
as a Man in Black.

03:23.133 --> 03:24.480
Now I've heard of that.

03:24.514 --> 03:26.171
But I didn't know
they really existed

03:26.206 --> 03:27.586
but that's what
he called himself.

03:27.621 --> 03:29.381
And then it hits me.

03:29.416 --> 03:30.934
You know what?

03:30.969 --> 03:32.971
He's got brain cancer, he's
taking all this medication.

03:33.005 --> 03:34.214
That's what's doing it.

03:34.248 --> 03:35.801
Okay he can't be
in his right mind.

03:35.836 --> 03:38.287
He's delusional
about this stuff.

03:38.321 --> 03:41.255
So next thing I know he
pulls out this drawer.

03:41.290 --> 03:43.153
He sets all these documents

03:43.188 --> 03:45.121
and letters and
paperwork in there.

03:45.155 --> 03:46.605
I'm looking at this and I know

03:46.640 --> 03:48.573
this is the real deal
it's not fabricated.

03:48.607 --> 03:50.299
I dealt with this stuff
when I was in the military.

03:50.333 --> 03:51.817
That's what I did.

03:51.852 --> 03:53.025
He's not making this up.

03:53.060 --> 03:54.613
I need to get more information.

03:54.648 --> 03:57.098
I need to find out what's
going on with this.

03:57.133 --> 04:00.240
Because this it was unbelievable
what he was telling me.

04:00.274 --> 04:03.588
As a result of the cancer Joe
decided to write a memoir.

04:05.037 --> 04:08.903
As he said it because he was
having a crisis of conscious.

04:08.938 --> 04:12.010
He felt it was his duty
and obligation to expose

04:12.044 --> 04:15.565
the fact that the human
race was in great peril

04:15.600 --> 04:18.879
and danger because of what
the government is doing.

04:18.913 --> 04:20.639
He had decided that he was gonna

04:20.673 --> 04:23.332
write the memoirs on
the old hand model--

04:23.366 --> 04:24.540
Manual typewriter.

04:24.574 --> 04:26.300
- Manual typewriters
remember those?

04:26.335 --> 04:27.784
Well that's what he used.

04:27.819 --> 04:30.649
He wouldn't us emails,
phone, no correspondence,

04:30.684 --> 04:33.618
no electronic, didn't
trust that at all.

04:33.652 --> 04:36.517
Otherwise, because he
knew he was being watched.

04:37.587 --> 04:41.211
The memoirs are not here.

04:41.246 --> 04:45.354
He's got them stashed
in a separate place and

04:46.838 --> 04:48.495
he didn't want to keep him
anywhere near where he was

04:48.529 --> 04:51.256
because he knew that they
would be looking for them.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.051
So he made arrangements and he

04:53.085 --> 04:55.018
has them in a
different location.

04:55.053 --> 04:57.158
Which is all I can say
about it right now.

05:10.586 --> 05:13.347
Joe has a storage facility.

05:13.382 --> 05:16.212
But his memoirs are
not in his storage.

05:16.246 --> 05:18.110
It's been searched
thoroughly it has not.

05:18.145 --> 05:20.078
When Joe died I came down

05:20.112 --> 05:23.288
and here you see
nothing here, gone.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.186
But I know the
memoirs weren't there.

05:25.221 --> 05:27.327
- Where
are the memoirs now?

05:28.466 --> 05:30.882
- I'm not gonna be able,
I can't tell you that

05:30.916 --> 05:32.987
until I get time to know
you a little bit better

05:33.022 --> 05:35.265
make sure you're alright
and then we can talk about

05:35.300 --> 05:37.578
that a little more but in
the meantime, and that' also

05:37.613 --> 05:40.926
for your protection by
the way as well as mine.

05:40.961 --> 05:43.101
If you know where
they are guess what?

05:43.135 --> 05:46.069
They're gonna be after
you even if you're not.

05:46.104 --> 05:47.588
And they know Joe
and I were tight.

05:47.623 --> 05:49.107
They know we talked a lot.

05:49.141 --> 05:51.903
So they're gonna put two
and two together I think.

05:51.937 --> 05:54.837
I don't have the training and
the knowledge like Joe had.

05:54.871 --> 05:56.252
I'm just a regular civilian.

05:56.286 --> 05:59.635
I don't know I walk
down the street and

05:59.669 --> 06:02.396
everybody looks the
same to me I don't know.

06:02.431 --> 06:04.605
Well I was supposed
to meet Joe for lunch.

06:05.710 --> 06:06.745
He didn't show up.

06:07.919 --> 06:12.682
I called him, text
him, no answer.

06:13.407 --> 06:16.306
That's not like Joe okay
he's always on time prompt.

06:16.341 --> 06:18.792
So right away I'm concerned.

06:18.826 --> 06:22.002
So I decide to go
up to his apartment.

06:22.036 --> 06:26.109
So I come up here, ring the
doorbell and bang on the door.

06:26.144 --> 06:26.972
No answer.

06:28.388 --> 06:31.460
So finally I said I really
know there's something wrong.

06:31.494 --> 06:35.325
So I get the manager
and we go inside and

06:38.984 --> 06:40.296
that's when we found him

06:41.642 --> 06:43.161
just laying dead on the couch.

06:44.783 --> 06:48.994
And then on top of it all
his apartment's a total mess,

06:49.029 --> 06:52.135
everything all over it looked
like it had been ransacked.

06:53.516 --> 06:55.380
And I can't get that because
I don't understand that

06:55.415 --> 06:57.209
because it's locked
from the inside.

06:58.314 --> 07:00.350
So here it is he's
dead, it's old ransacked

07:00.385 --> 07:02.939
locked from the inside
and Joe couldn't do it.

07:02.974 --> 07:06.322
He's too frail he couldn't
move all that stuff around.

07:06.356 --> 07:08.462
I say it's those guys.

07:08.497 --> 07:10.153
They knew what he was doing.

07:10.188 --> 07:12.086
They were looking
for the memoirs

07:12.121 --> 07:15.331
and they went in,
they ransacked.

07:15.365 --> 07:17.989
And the coroner
says natural causes.

07:18.023 --> 07:19.059
But you know what?

07:19.093 --> 07:20.163
I don't believe that.

07:22.683 --> 07:23.891
I think they killed him.

07:46.362 --> 07:47.639
I don't feel safe anymore.

07:49.054 --> 07:51.091
I get the feeling that
I'm always being watched.

07:51.125 --> 07:53.265
So I travel to populated areas.

07:53.300 --> 07:55.509
It's the only way I can
focus on my strategy

07:55.544 --> 07:57.787
to release the memoirs
in the right way.

07:58.926 --> 08:01.204
Every day I'm reaching
out to publishers,

08:01.239 --> 08:04.345
bloggers, conspiracy
sites trying to find

08:04.380 --> 08:07.452
someone, anyone who will
take this seriously.

08:08.557 --> 08:09.972
Trouble is the second I mention

08:10.006 --> 08:12.837
Man in Black the
door closes on me.

08:12.871 --> 08:14.079
I don't think most people think

08:14.114 --> 08:16.426
they ever existed
only in the movies.

08:17.393 --> 08:18.567
I'm getting desperate.

08:18.601 --> 08:20.638
I feel the walls
closing in on me.

08:21.846 --> 08:24.400
If I'm gonna do this
I got to do it fast

08:24.434 --> 08:25.988
because if anything
happens to me

08:26.022 --> 08:27.852
nobody will know
what lies ahead.

08:33.097 --> 08:35.860
Okay I gotta get this place
cleaned up she's coming over.

08:35.894 --> 08:37.688
Anne's the one I told you about.

08:37.724 --> 08:38.966
She doesn't approve
of this whole thing.

08:39.001 --> 08:40.554
She doesn't like it at all.

08:40.589 --> 08:42.038
I met Joe through her.

08:42.073 --> 08:43.523
She knew Joe before she knew me.

08:43.557 --> 08:46.180
He needed a place to stay so.

08:46.215 --> 08:48.010
And she lives in an
apartment in this building.

08:48.044 --> 08:51.047
So she's the reason this
whole thing happened.

08:51.082 --> 08:53.291
She hadn't brought Joe over
here I never would have met him

08:53.325 --> 08:55.949
and never would have
had this situation.

08:57.606 --> 08:59.780
Hi sweety how you doing?

09:02.127 --> 09:03.784
Anne this is Robert Colson.

09:03.819 --> 09:07.581
He's the documentarian
that's doing them film so--

09:07.616 --> 09:08.858
- Nice to meet you.

09:08.893 --> 09:11.827
- He's gonna be asking
us all the questions.

09:11.861 --> 09:14.726
- So if it weren't for me

09:14.761 --> 09:17.591
Joe and Tom never
would have met.

09:17.626 --> 09:20.421
Yeah there was
something about him.

09:20.456 --> 09:24.460
He seemed to have this dark
side which frightened me.

09:24.494 --> 09:29.189
And I always been taught that
I should follow my intuition

09:31.087 --> 09:34.815
and this just didn't seem right.

09:34.850 --> 09:37.369
He could release
them anonymously

09:37.404 --> 09:39.268
if it weren't for
this documentary.

09:39.302 --> 09:44.307
Now I know that's your job
and I respect you for that.

09:47.483 --> 09:50.590
Why does Tom have to be in it?

09:50.624 --> 09:53.385
- As long as it's
out in the open

09:53.420 --> 09:56.665
it doesn't make any sense for
them to do anything to me.

09:56.699 --> 10:00.082
So that's the reason why
we've got to do it this way.

10:00.116 --> 10:01.670
It's actually protecting me.

10:03.050 --> 10:04.673
- I don't see it that way.

10:04.707 --> 10:05.674
- As long as you have them.

10:05.708 --> 10:07.641
- Then you have them please?

10:07.676 --> 10:08.987
- Yes hon everything's good.

10:09.022 --> 10:10.299
- I'm sorry.

10:10.333 --> 10:12.577
I'm sorry I have to go.

10:14.683 --> 10:17.444
- Can't explain it to her.

10:17.478 --> 10:19.101
I had this dream
the other night.

10:20.689 --> 10:21.586
I can't forget it.

10:22.898 --> 10:27.903
I was on this
table, white table.

10:31.976 --> 10:34.599
The room was completely
white all the way around me.

10:39.293 --> 10:44.298
I couldn't move my
hands, my arms, my legs.

10:45.230 --> 10:46.749
I couldn't, I felt paralyzed.

10:48.233 --> 10:51.581
I just couldn't move I'm just
lying there, this white room.

10:55.516 --> 11:00.487
All of a sudden this
figure appears a man.

11:02.213 --> 11:03.732
He was in a dark suit.

11:07.770 --> 11:09.599
He was speaking at
me but I couldn't

11:09.634 --> 11:11.671
understand what he was saying.

11:11.705 --> 11:14.812
It sounded like he
was like when you hear

11:14.846 --> 11:17.815
people talking under water and

11:20.231 --> 11:22.440
it just felt like I was drugged.

11:22.474 --> 11:24.166
I felt drugged is what it was.

11:25.305 --> 11:28.480
He takes his glasses
off he had these

11:28.515 --> 11:33.520
sunglasses on and his
eyes were all black.

11:35.695 --> 11:40.044
I can't help but feel like it
was some kind of a message.

11:40.078 --> 11:42.805
The dream was trying
to tell me something.

11:42.840 --> 11:44.911
That's just haunting me.

11:49.950 --> 11:51.538
Well here's the bad news.

11:57.682 --> 11:59.822
Anne puts my name
in a search engine

11:59.857 --> 12:01.651
every day 'cause she's
worried about me.

12:01.686 --> 12:04.931
So today this link pops
up, look at this thing.

12:06.311 --> 12:09.729
This is from that documentarian
that I hired before you.

12:11.247 --> 12:13.767
It says I owe him
money which I do not.

12:13.802 --> 12:15.665
And so he posts this thing.

12:15.700 --> 12:18.013
And this is a big
big problem for me.

12:18.047 --> 12:20.394
Burbank, California
man named Tom Keating

12:20.429 --> 12:22.603
who befriended an
ex Man in Black

12:22.638 --> 12:23.881
in the last years of his life.

12:23.915 --> 12:26.090
Oh yeah great just what I need

12:26.124 --> 12:28.126
my name out there for
everybody to know.

12:29.334 --> 12:31.198
Burbank, California
man to unveil

12:31.233 --> 12:33.511
memoirs of an
actual Man in Black.

12:34.684 --> 12:37.515
Documentarian Eric
Hayes, that's the idiot

12:38.688 --> 12:40.414
reached out to us with
a story that could

12:40.449 --> 12:42.900
blow the lid off the lies
and secrets the government

12:42.934 --> 12:45.695
has been concealing
from us all these years.

12:45.730 --> 12:47.801
Hayes claims I've
worked on a documentary

12:47.836 --> 12:51.080
about a Burbank, California
man named Tom Keating.

12:51.115 --> 12:53.462
He befriended an ex Man in Black

12:53.496 --> 12:55.705
in the last years of his life.

12:55.740 --> 12:58.536
Following his 20 years
of service as a silencer

12:58.570 --> 13:00.296
the retired operative
changes identity

13:00.331 --> 13:02.782
and became known
as Joseph Spencer.

13:04.059 --> 13:06.199
Keating, the subject
of the documentary

13:06.233 --> 13:09.581
inherited Spencer's memoirs
following his death.

13:09.616 --> 13:12.343
The explosive journal not only
details his professional life

13:12.377 --> 13:16.140
as a Man in Black but also
names high ranking individuals

13:16.174 --> 13:18.383
within our government
and military.

13:18.418 --> 13:20.730
They also reveal
accounts of the murders

13:20.765 --> 13:24.182
of noted ufologists,
UFO witnesses,

13:24.217 --> 13:27.220
whistle blowers,
abductees, and more.

13:27.254 --> 13:29.291
Hayes claims that the
most shocking aspect

13:29.325 --> 13:32.259
of the memoirs is the
revelation of the genocidal

13:32.294 --> 13:35.849
global cleansing that has
already gone into effect

13:35.884 --> 13:37.540
courtesy of the United
States government

13:37.575 --> 13:39.888
and an elite secret
society that rules

13:39.922 --> 13:42.338
every aspect of human existence.

13:43.374 --> 13:45.065
Hayes saw the memoirs firsthand

13:45.100 --> 13:46.895
and is convinced they are real.

13:46.929 --> 13:48.862
The real question
to be asked is not

13:48.897 --> 13:50.968
when Keating will
release this holy grail

13:51.002 --> 13:53.211
of conspiracy
disclosure but rather

13:53.246 --> 13:55.179
why he hasn't done so already?

13:56.594 --> 14:01.461
I mean why don't they just
sign my death warrant?

14:03.118 --> 14:05.810
I mean now everybody's
gonna know who I am and

14:06.742 --> 14:08.640
these Men in Black pals of Joe's

14:08.675 --> 14:10.228
are gonna come
after me I bet you.

14:10.263 --> 14:12.472
So I just don't
know what to do now.

14:12.506 --> 14:13.991
I think I should
just send the memoirs

14:14.025 --> 14:16.165
to these guys and let
them just go ahead

14:16.200 --> 14:18.064
and publish them and
just be done with it.

14:18.098 --> 14:20.445
And once they're out
I'm good, I'm fine.

14:20.480 --> 14:21.895
I don't have to worry about it.

14:23.483 --> 14:24.933
Say who are these guys?

14:24.967 --> 14:27.521
Top Secret Exposed.

15:11.186 --> 15:13.913
Okay it's sent,
see what happens.

15:17.433 --> 15:19.608
I'm gonna make two
copies of the memoirs.

15:19.642 --> 15:22.093
And I'm gonna send one to my
friend in Colorado Springs.

15:22.128 --> 15:24.268
And I'm doing that
because I want

15:24.302 --> 15:27.271
somebody else to have
a set besides me.

15:27.305 --> 15:28.962
Just a little bit of insurance

15:28.997 --> 15:30.930
and back up if
something happens.

15:32.103 --> 15:34.588
And besides nobody
knows I'm sending it

15:34.623 --> 15:37.039
so it'll just be
between me and him.

15:38.006 --> 15:39.524
And this plan should work.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.183
And another reason why
I'm doing this is because

15:43.218 --> 15:46.773
that site that posted
that article about me

15:46.807 --> 15:48.706
well I sent them
memoirs and I thought

15:48.740 --> 15:50.708
for sure that they
would publish them.

15:50.742 --> 15:52.330
I haven't heard
a word from them.

15:52.365 --> 15:54.194
So I don't know what's
going on with them.

15:54.229 --> 15:56.990
And not only that I sent
them to two other sites.

15:57.025 --> 15:59.924
Another site I haven't heard
anything from them either.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.616
Another site sent me a
one word answer, fake.

16:32.888 --> 16:36.202
♪ Happy birthday to you

16:37.720 --> 16:40.378
- Okay now thank you, here I go.

16:43.243 --> 16:45.142
- Happy birthday honey.

16:46.281 --> 16:48.352
- Brother he just
came for my birthday.

16:48.386 --> 16:50.940
He's going back to
Vermont tomorrow.

16:50.975 --> 16:51.872
- Hello brother.

16:51.907 --> 16:53.046
- His name is Michael.

16:53.081 --> 16:53.943
- Nice to meet you.

16:53.978 --> 16:54.772
- Hi I'm Claire.

16:54.806 --> 16:55.842
Hi nice to meet you.

16:55.876 --> 16:58.120
- And Ben, Ben is--

16:58.155 --> 17:01.020
- One of my favorite holidays,

17:01.882 --> 17:03.470
occasions is Anne's birthday.

17:05.438 --> 17:08.579
Not only does she get
younger, but she gets better.

17:11.133 --> 17:13.686
I appreciate how much
you care about me,

17:13.722 --> 17:16.449
and putting up with
some of my crazy things

17:17.346 --> 17:19.969
which I hope will soon be over.

17:20.003 --> 17:21.143
- I hope so too.

17:23.559 --> 17:24.387
- One smart man
right there, very smart man.

17:27.874 --> 17:29.289
Thank you very much.

17:29.324 --> 17:31.636
- I better stick with
coffee because I think--

17:31.671 --> 17:33.328
- Happy birthday.

17:33.362 --> 17:34.536
- You're an inspiration.

17:34.570 --> 17:35.468
- Cake?

17:35.502 --> 17:36.607
- Always a big fan.

17:36.641 --> 17:37.435
- Always cut the cake.

17:37.470 --> 17:38.298
- Not today.

17:41.025 --> 17:45.098
- Oh Tom what

17:47.411 --> 17:48.860
My own special glass.

17:52.450 --> 17:53.555
He's leaving tomorrow.

17:55.557 --> 17:59.906
And I wanted him to stay
but no he has to get back.

17:59.940 --> 18:01.839
- She's another wonderful woman.

18:01.873 --> 18:03.358
Very very nice, very pleasant.

18:04.531 --> 18:05.808
Say hi Claire.

18:05.843 --> 18:06.671
- Hi.

18:08.190 --> 18:10.744
- Maybe she's a little bit
camera shy I don't know.

18:11.918 --> 18:14.645
And I always liked your
advice and everything.

18:14.679 --> 18:16.819
She's very very good, very
helpful, very good friend.

18:19.581 --> 18:20.616
- So I

18:21.790 --> 18:24.965
I think I found someone,
he's a psychiatrist.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.209
I think it would be really good

18:27.244 --> 18:29.694
for him to see him
because he's great.

18:31.282 --> 18:32.697
That would be the next step.

18:33.664 --> 18:35.528
And I think it's very important.

18:36.908 --> 18:39.877
We should get him there
as soon as possible

18:39.911 --> 18:41.810
so it doesn't get any
worse and we could--

18:41.844 --> 18:44.019
- But how are we
going to approach this

18:44.053 --> 18:45.848
without him being offended?

18:45.883 --> 18:48.057
- Have you suggested
anything like that?

18:48.092 --> 18:49.576
Him seeing anybody before?

18:51.199 --> 18:55.030
- I've tried but it's like
beating around the bush.

18:55.064 --> 18:57.308
I don't, I haven't come right on

18:57.343 --> 19:00.208
and said I think you need this.

19:00.242 --> 19:04.695
In our relationship I'm
not a medical professional.

19:04.729 --> 19:08.319
I'm an English
professor you know.

19:08.354 --> 19:11.529
He thinks he's going
to save the world.

19:11.564 --> 19:13.186
I just don't know what to do.

19:13.221 --> 19:14.981
He seems to be getting worse.

19:15.015 --> 19:19.951
- Anne I know this
psychiatrist would be great

19:21.367 --> 19:23.748
if you could take him there
because he really needs to go.

19:23.783 --> 19:25.405
- But how do I approach it?

19:27.890 --> 19:30.376
- Have you suggested
anything like this before?

19:30.410 --> 19:32.585
- Oh no I can't do that.

19:33.965 --> 19:35.967
- Does he
get defensive or what?

19:36.002 --> 19:39.937
- He just would think
that I think he's crazy.

19:39.971 --> 19:41.870
And I don't think he's
crazy I just I think--

19:41.904 --> 19:43.768
- I know, I understand.

19:43.803 --> 19:48.221
Would you mind if
I talked to him?

19:48.256 --> 19:50.741
- Oh that would be wonderful.

19:50.775 --> 19:52.156
- Yeah?
- Yes.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.433
- Okay.

19:53.468 --> 19:56.574
Well it's when a
person sometimes

19:56.609 --> 20:00.923
due to an injury or
trauma believes that

20:02.201 --> 20:06.135
someone is following
them or it could be even

20:06.170 --> 20:08.966
that they think that someone
is in love with them or

20:10.139 --> 20:12.245
that someone is
there to harm someone

20:12.280 --> 20:15.214
who they love or care about.

20:15.248 --> 20:19.218
And usually it's
either exaggerated

20:19.252 --> 20:23.118
like seriously
exaggerated or untrue.

20:24.878 --> 20:29.262
It worries me a little
bit this documentary that

20:31.264 --> 20:34.923
you following him around
and he's a delusional man.

20:36.269 --> 20:38.547
And personally I'm
worried about him

20:38.582 --> 20:40.860
and I wouldn't
want to use someone

20:40.894 --> 20:44.243
who's ill for anybody's
entertainment.

20:46.279 --> 20:50.249
- Each of my students and I
know what they need to do.

20:50.283 --> 20:54.253
And if a child is really
working and struggling

20:54.287 --> 20:58.360
then I accept that
they're doing their best.

20:58.395 --> 20:59.603
- Give a
little more leeway.

20:59.637 --> 21:03.089
- Yes but if they're
extremely gifted

21:03.123 --> 21:08.094
and just sliding through
then I push them.

21:46.753 --> 21:50.412
- Beautiful beautiful,
great, wonderful.

21:50.447 --> 21:52.276
- Yeah and you saw the latest
recidivism report right

21:52.311 --> 21:56.107
on CNN and the bombings
going on over there right?

21:56.142 --> 21:58.972
I'm okay a little nuts
but if you think about it

21:59.007 --> 22:01.250
if they're out there and the
drone strikes are going on

22:01.285 --> 22:03.287
and we know we're
3000 miles away.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.185
We don't know what's happening.

22:05.220 --> 22:06.394
Who knows what's happening here?

22:06.428 --> 22:08.430
But we don't care over here.

22:08.465 --> 22:10.674
But you don't know what's
going on right above the house.

22:10.708 --> 22:13.987
It's 100 miles above
it could be microphones

22:14.022 --> 22:15.713
picking up what
we're talking about.

22:15.748 --> 22:18.095
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I
didn't mean anything by it.

22:18.129 --> 22:20.684
It was the Dom, it
really was the Dom.

22:20.718 --> 22:22.651
Who knows who he's
reporting to right.

22:22.686 --> 22:25.965
I mean it could be anybody.

22:25.999 --> 22:28.174
- Hey listen it's not funny.

22:28.208 --> 22:29.382
The government really
does stuff like this.

22:29.417 --> 22:31.384
You guys just don't
really understand.

22:31.419 --> 22:32.558
No I mean it.

22:32.592 --> 22:33.766
If you only really
knew what's going on.

22:33.800 --> 22:35.630
You don't really know okay.

22:35.664 --> 22:38.633
And we're all in
very grave danger.

22:38.667 --> 22:39.875
This is not a joke.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.603
You don't understand what
this government is doing.

22:45.364 --> 22:46.192
If you only knew.

22:54.234 --> 22:57.134
- It's okay it's
okay he's just tired.

22:57.168 --> 22:59.999
It's been a really long
day and he's had some wine.

23:00.033 --> 23:03.071
Some people get
cranky some times.

23:04.555 --> 23:05.487
- He's alright though I mean.

23:05.522 --> 23:08.801
- Yeah yeah he's fine he's fine.

23:13.840 --> 23:15.428
- Last week I sent the
package with the memoirs

23:15.463 --> 23:17.499
to my friend in
Colorado Springs.

23:17.534 --> 23:19.225
He never got them.

23:19.259 --> 23:20.882
So this is what happened.

23:20.916 --> 23:25.024
Your parcel has arrived at the
post office at January 29th.

23:25.058 --> 23:28.061
Our courier was unable to
deliver the parcel to you.

23:28.096 --> 23:30.029
Like I said I don't know
how that's possible.

23:30.063 --> 23:32.721
He's retired, he's
there all the time.

23:32.756 --> 23:34.378
To receive your
parcel please go to

23:34.413 --> 23:36.415
the nearest office
and show this receipt.

23:36.449 --> 23:38.796
Which is exactly what he did.

23:38.831 --> 23:42.835
He goes down there and the
clerk behind the counter says

23:42.869 --> 23:44.940
that somebody
already picked it up.

23:44.975 --> 23:48.668
I don't know how that's possible
because it's in his name.

23:48.703 --> 23:52.361
Now my friend's home all
the time he's retired.

23:52.396 --> 23:53.604
- Okay.

23:53.639 --> 23:55.951
- So there's no way
he can not be there.

23:55.986 --> 23:57.850
Well I think it got intercepted.

23:59.092 --> 24:00.404
I'll bet anything on it.

24:01.716 --> 24:04.650
I'm sure that those
guys are onto me.

24:05.858 --> 24:06.962
There's just been too
much stuff happening.

24:06.997 --> 24:09.862
This is just another,
another thing.

24:09.896 --> 24:11.864
And not only that.

24:11.898 --> 24:15.177
That website that publish
the article about me

24:15.212 --> 24:18.733
I sent the memoirs to,
can't find it here.

24:25.774 --> 24:27.396
See.

24:27.431 --> 24:29.778
That's the site,
see what happens.

24:29.813 --> 24:30.986
It's not there anymore.

24:33.920 --> 24:35.543
I sent them the memoirs.

24:37.130 --> 24:38.269
Now I can't find them.

24:39.926 --> 24:43.999
I don't know it's just another
sign of what's going on.

24:44.034 --> 24:45.863
There's somebody hanging
out on the corner

24:45.898 --> 24:48.452
over here watching
me all the time.

24:48.487 --> 24:51.662
Knocking on my door,
I get phone calls,

24:51.697 --> 24:54.527
strange noises you name it.

24:54.562 --> 24:56.425
Nothing I do seems to work.

24:57.944 --> 25:00.499
And they seem like they know
exactly what I'm gonna do

25:00.533 --> 25:03.225
when I'm gonna do it and
they stop it somehow.

25:03.260 --> 25:05.400
Like Joe told me these
guys can do anything.

25:05.434 --> 25:08.852
They got all sorts of money
they got all sorts of equipment,

25:10.060 --> 25:12.649
sophisticated technology
that we don't have any

25:12.683 --> 25:14.167
we don't know anything about.

25:15.893 --> 25:17.136
And some of the stuff I've read

25:17.170 --> 25:19.414
in them memoirs is
entirely possible.

25:19.448 --> 25:20.864
I don't know maybe Anne's right.

25:20.898 --> 25:23.142
Maybe I'm just batting
my head against the wall.

25:24.557 --> 25:27.318
But I can't quit
now I'm too far in.

25:27.353 --> 25:29.320
So I'm gonna send
it to you again but

25:31.530 --> 25:33.601
I'm just kind of betting the
same thing is gonna happen.

25:35.292 --> 25:38.053
But this time let's
just be right on it.

25:38.088 --> 25:40.400
Just be there before
they have a chance

25:40.435 --> 25:43.300
to give it to anybody
else, let's try that.

25:44.681 --> 25:47.131
Alright thanks, alright
Jim, alright see you later.

25:50.341 --> 25:51.791
Now I got to worry about him.

25:53.862 --> 25:56.485
Because if they know
he's gonna get it

26:01.421 --> 26:05.184
I don't know if that's the
right thing to do or not.

26:05.218 --> 26:06.634
I don't even know if I should,

26:06.668 --> 26:08.670
I could be putting his life
in danger if I send it.

26:14.400 --> 26:16.954
Except I don't know
what else to do.

26:16.989 --> 26:19.025
Okay so I'm typing in
the tracking number

26:20.233 --> 26:21.959
to see if I can find
out any more information

26:21.994 --> 26:23.685
on what happened
to this package.

26:25.238 --> 26:30.243
Okay 639, okay 639, enter.

26:31.382 --> 26:33.419
The tracking number
you entered is invalid.

26:33.453 --> 26:35.352
Please correct it and retry.

26:37.492 --> 26:39.321
639, 639.

26:44.085 --> 26:46.328
Nope invalid.

26:48.330 --> 26:49.159
No good.

26:52.058 --> 26:55.337
- So the reason I'm
here right now is because

26:55.372 --> 26:58.375
your friend Claire stopped
by my studio yesterday.

26:59.548 --> 27:01.067
The gal I met at
the birthday party

27:02.275 --> 27:05.796
and she wanted to be on
camera talking about you

27:06.970 --> 27:09.179
and her concerns and
a few other things

27:09.213 --> 27:11.319
which I think you need to see.

27:11.353 --> 27:12.872
- Yeah well she wants
me to go to a doctor.

27:12.907 --> 27:15.012
She thinks I need
a psychiatrist.

27:15.047 --> 27:17.325
Which I am not gonna do.

27:17.359 --> 27:18.671
- Right.

27:18.706 --> 27:20.846
- She's got Anne
involved in this too.

27:20.880 --> 27:23.503
- Yeah well let
me play the video for you.

27:24.435 --> 27:25.609
Here we go.

27:25.644 --> 27:30.165
- It's apparent that
he's become increasingly

27:31.097 --> 27:34.169
more unstable and paranoid.

27:34.204 --> 27:36.206
- Is she talking about me?

27:36.240 --> 27:39.623
- And you I'm sure you know.

27:39.658 --> 27:42.902
I suggested he go to
this doctor I know

27:42.937 --> 27:46.699
who is happy to help him who
would really be useful for him.

27:46.734 --> 27:51.739
He doesn't want any help,
he's in total denial about--

27:52.636 --> 27:53.741
- I don't need it Claire.

27:57.158 --> 27:58.953
- And I mean I'm just,

27:58.987 --> 28:00.195
both me and Anne are
just very worried

28:00.230 --> 28:04.924
that what if he has
a mental collapse?

28:06.615 --> 28:08.963
He could be in
danger for himself.

28:10.378 --> 28:15.383
So what I'm asking
you is that if I could

28:16.246 --> 28:18.627
be part of this documentary--

28:18.662 --> 28:20.837
- No no no don't let
her be part of this.

28:20.871 --> 28:23.598
- Project you're doing.

28:24.703 --> 28:27.636
This would help me
assess his mental state

28:28.983 --> 28:31.744
so much better to be
close to him 'cause he

28:31.779 --> 28:33.366
doesn't really
want to talk to me

28:33.401 --> 28:35.748
so if I could be part
of this project it would

28:35.783 --> 28:38.924
be so much easier for
me to monitor him.

28:38.958 --> 28:40.546
- No there's nothing
wrong with me.

28:40.580 --> 28:41.858
- You don't want to be complicit

28:41.892 --> 28:43.652
to a person's mental
collapse do you?

28:43.687 --> 28:45.344
- Of course not.

28:45.378 --> 28:46.207
- Good.

28:47.622 --> 28:50.832
I need you to give me all
the footage so I can watch it

28:50.867 --> 28:53.317
as soon as possible
within the next two days.

28:53.352 --> 28:55.457
It's very important
so I can assess

28:55.492 --> 28:58.667
where he is mentally
at this point.

28:58.702 --> 29:00.600
- Where in God's name
is she getting this?

29:00.635 --> 29:03.500
- Okay well let me
speak to him about that first

29:03.534 --> 29:04.708
before I give you the footage.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.745
- Don't just speak to him.

29:06.779 --> 29:09.817
You must convince
him you understand?

29:09.851 --> 29:12.060
This is important.

29:12.095 --> 29:17.031
Now the second reason I'm
here I just wanted to ask you

29:18.204 --> 29:19.654
throughout this whole
process you've been

29:19.688 --> 29:22.933
working with Tom has
there been ever any

29:22.968 --> 29:26.592
concrete evidence that
any of this is true?

29:26.626 --> 29:28.663
- Oh this is getting
better all the time.

29:28.697 --> 29:30.665
- Not exactly.

29:30.699 --> 29:32.805
- That's what I thought.

29:32.840 --> 29:35.981
I've been talking to
a guy a friend of mine

29:36.015 --> 29:38.224
who knows a guy who
works for the Department

29:38.259 --> 29:40.019
of Justice and I asked him to do

29:40.054 --> 29:43.471
a background check on
Mr. Joseph Spencer.

29:43.505 --> 29:45.231
This is what he basically found.

29:47.026 --> 29:51.859
So Joseph Spencer's real name
is John Alexander Layton.

29:51.893 --> 29:55.586
He was born in Jefferson
City, Missouri 1939.

29:55.621 --> 29:59.176
He had no formal education
and spent most of his years

29:59.211 --> 30:02.593
working at a lumber mill
in Warren County, Georgia.

30:02.628 --> 30:06.528
From there he worked as
an independent contractor

30:06.563 --> 30:11.568
in Cleveland, Ohio until 2005
at which time he retired.

30:12.776 --> 30:14.605
He was never married
or had any children.

30:14.640 --> 30:18.057
Following his retirement he
became a conspiracy theory

30:18.092 --> 30:22.821
activist with claims that the
moon landings were a hoax,

30:22.855 --> 30:26.997
that the government is engaged
in a human cleansing plot,

30:27.032 --> 30:30.000
that space aliens
are living among us

30:30.035 --> 30:31.553
and working with our military

30:31.588 --> 30:34.073
to devise super
advanced technology.

30:34.108 --> 30:35.592
- That's right.

30:35.626 --> 30:38.837
- Mr. Layton moved to North
Hollywood, California 2008

30:38.871 --> 30:43.013
and for reasons unknown changed
his name to Joseph Spencer.

30:43.048 --> 30:48.053
At no time in his
life, at no time

30:49.226 --> 30:52.264
did Mr. Layton serve
in the US military

30:52.298 --> 30:54.749
or in any branch of government.

30:55.992 --> 30:58.926
He was not an
intelligence operative,

30:58.960 --> 31:02.688
a spy, an agent,
or a Man in Black.

31:05.933 --> 31:10.592
Which means that the
memoirs are a complete

31:10.627 --> 31:14.700
fabrication written by
a deluded individual.

31:14.734 --> 31:17.668
I'm giving you this
paperwork to show to Tom.

31:17.703 --> 31:19.601
He'll probably dismiss it.

31:19.636 --> 31:21.914
But at least I wanted
you to know the truth.

31:24.020 --> 31:28.576
All of this, everything
you're doing is based on lies.

31:35.031 --> 31:37.792
- So this is
the background report

31:37.826 --> 31:40.243
she gave me to give you
and I think you need

31:40.277 --> 31:43.971
to look at that and
tell me what you think.

32:04.439 --> 32:06.855
- I want you to know
this is all bullshit.

32:06.890 --> 32:09.375
I mean does she really think
the Department of Justice

32:09.410 --> 32:11.308
is going to release
classified information

32:11.343 --> 32:14.518
on one of their covert
agents to a common civilian?

32:14.553 --> 32:16.900
One thing Joe said was
that all the Men in Black

32:16.935 --> 32:21.146
had their past histories completely
wiped out a clean slate.

32:22.285 --> 32:24.459
This bogus report proves that.

32:24.494 --> 32:26.945
I mean Claire is so naive.

32:26.979 --> 32:28.981
I was in the military.

32:29.016 --> 32:33.779
I saw classified documents,
reports, communications.

32:33.813 --> 32:36.920
Joe had all of those
in his possession.

32:36.955 --> 32:39.302
I mean this guy could describe
the innermost workings

32:39.336 --> 32:42.753
of above top secret operations.

32:42.788 --> 32:46.550
He drew underground bases,
secret departments within NASA,

32:46.585 --> 32:48.725
sub basements at the Pentagon.

32:48.759 --> 32:51.245
And I'm supposed to believe
some common everyday schmuck

32:51.279 --> 32:54.627
working at the lumber mill
or an independent contractor

32:54.662 --> 32:57.527
working for a cement
company could know all this?

32:59.287 --> 33:03.119
Come on that's the bullshit.

33:03.153 --> 33:06.536
Yeah I saw your little
interview and I'm very upset.

33:06.570 --> 33:08.434
There's nothing wrong with me.

33:08.469 --> 33:10.471
I'm as sane now
as I've ever been

33:10.505 --> 33:12.852
and I resent the accusation.

33:12.887 --> 33:14.854
And I don't like you
feeding that crap to Anne.

33:14.889 --> 33:16.718
I don't care what
you think Claire.

33:16.753 --> 33:18.030
I want you to leave me alone

33:18.065 --> 33:20.550
and I want you to
stay away from Anne.

33:20.584 --> 33:22.172
You know she hasn't returned
any of my calls lately

33:22.207 --> 33:24.623
and I'm guessing
it's because of you.

33:24.657 --> 33:27.350
And no more speaking to
Robert he works for me got it.

33:28.523 --> 33:29.938
That's all I have
to say goodbye.

33:35.772 --> 33:36.738
I'm sorry Robert.

33:38.016 --> 33:40.880
I think you should go out.

33:40.915 --> 33:42.813
I want to be alone
for right now okay.

33:42.848 --> 33:44.643
- Yeah no that's fine.

33:44.677 --> 33:46.024
- I'll give you a call tomorrow.

33:46.058 --> 33:46.886
- Okay.

33:49.717 --> 33:52.409
- Alright I'm ready to
show you the memoirs.

33:52.444 --> 33:55.033
Now we're gonna go to
an undisclosed location.

33:55.067 --> 33:56.827
We're gonna take my
vehicle and you're not

33:56.862 --> 33:58.139
gonna know where we're gonna go.

34:07.838 --> 34:09.150
Look at this.

34:19.402 --> 34:21.300
- That's weird.

34:21.335 --> 34:23.199
- That's the second
time that's happened.

34:24.579 --> 34:25.408
Nobody.

34:29.722 --> 34:30.551
No one.

34:35.831 --> 34:36.797
Nobody here.

34:43.978 --> 34:46.187
How could they knock that
fist and disappear like that?

34:47.739 --> 34:48.569
You tell me.

34:49.811 --> 34:52.813
Alright let's go, let's go.

34:54.437 --> 34:56.887
So I've selected
portions to read off.

34:56.922 --> 35:00.581
We'll do the vital stuff
today and more tomorrow.

35:00.615 --> 35:02.307
Okay here it is.

35:04.067 --> 35:06.966
My name is Joseph Spencer.

35:07.001 --> 35:11.764
From May, 1970 to
October, 1997 I served

35:11.799 --> 35:15.389
the United States Government
as a top secret operative

35:15.423 --> 35:18.978
but not in a category that is
commonly known or understood.

35:19.013 --> 35:21.843
I was known as a Man in Black.

35:23.259 --> 35:25.778
Following seven years acting
as a counterintelligence agent

35:25.813 --> 35:28.988
for the CIA I was recruited
for a new assignment

35:29.023 --> 35:33.683
that entailed working within
above top secret operations.

35:34.822 --> 35:36.893
I was aware of the
black budget projects

35:36.927 --> 35:39.620
but never knew the
context of them

35:39.654 --> 35:41.932
due to their high
level of secrecy.

35:41.967 --> 35:45.833
Even the President was denied
access to their inner workings

35:45.867 --> 35:49.837
Annually billions of dollars
are poured into black projects

35:49.871 --> 35:53.772
which operate without any
supervision or intrusion.

35:53.806 --> 35:55.187
They have full autonomy.

35:56.326 --> 35:58.846
The operations deal
primarily with advancing

35:58.880 --> 36:02.470
military technologies
most of which have been

36:02.505 --> 36:06.371
reversed engineered from
recovered alien spacecrafts

36:06.405 --> 36:09.891
that had either crashed or
were shot down by our military.

36:10.892 --> 36:13.205
The public sadly will never ever

36:13.240 --> 36:15.449
have knowledge of
these operations.

36:16.933 --> 36:20.523
This transition in my
life happened in 1970.

36:20.557 --> 36:22.663
The senior Black
Project Director was

36:22.697 --> 36:25.528
William T. Latham
who had worked under

36:25.562 --> 36:28.427
CIA Executive Director
Richard Schlesinger.

36:29.497 --> 36:30.878
Latham stated that I was

36:30.912 --> 36:33.708
the perfect candidate
for my new position.

36:33.743 --> 36:35.607
I was a foster child and I had

36:35.641 --> 36:38.610
no connections to
existing relatives.

36:38.644 --> 36:40.681
I had no friends or social life.

36:40.715 --> 36:43.304
It was easy for them
to erase my past

36:43.339 --> 36:46.065
and provide me with
a new identity.

36:46.100 --> 36:49.172
I gave myself to them as
a priest would to his God.

36:50.449 --> 36:53.141
But first my mind
had to be erased.

36:54.557 --> 36:58.595
I was injected with various
forms of mind altering drugs,

36:58.630 --> 37:03.428
LSD, heroin, mescaline, morphine,
sodium pentothal and more.

37:03.462 --> 37:06.016
Drug induced hypnosis
followed with

37:06.051 --> 37:09.157
antegrade and
retrograde amnesia.

37:09.192 --> 37:12.022
The goal was to program
me to do two things,

37:12.057 --> 37:13.300
kill and forget.

37:14.922 --> 37:16.372
After nine months of programming

37:16.406 --> 37:19.547
I had become a Man in Black.

37:21.653 --> 37:22.895
What I later discovered was that

37:22.930 --> 37:24.276
not all the Men in
Black were human.

37:24.311 --> 37:26.796
About a third were
alien hybrids.

37:26.830 --> 37:29.108
The distinctive feature
was the absence of whites

37:29.143 --> 37:32.457
in their eyes giving the
impression of empty eye sockets.

37:33.630 --> 37:36.184
This unsettled me and
it took months to adjust

37:36.219 --> 37:39.153
to the reality of
alien integration.

37:40.292 --> 37:42.294
My assignments
largely dealt with

37:42.329 --> 37:44.296
UFO sightings and crash sites.

37:44.331 --> 37:48.921
In August of 1971 I witnessed
my first UFO crash site

37:48.956 --> 37:52.753
just north of Edwards Air
Force Base in California.

37:52.787 --> 37:55.790
Inside the craft were
three gray humanoids,

37:55.825 --> 37:57.792
two dead, one still alive.

37:58.966 --> 38:02.072
Also in the craft was a
human female abductee.

38:03.281 --> 38:06.042
The alien humanoids were
transported to the base

38:06.076 --> 38:08.216
but two witnesses
had arrived before us

38:08.251 --> 38:10.805
and took several photographs.

38:10.840 --> 38:13.739
The first surrendered his
camera but the second fled.

38:14.878 --> 38:17.191
When we apprehended
him he resisted

38:17.225 --> 38:20.712
and I was ordered to
silence him, which I did.

38:20.746 --> 38:23.784
The killing of witnesses
was executed with a wand

38:24.957 --> 38:27.650
that acted very much
like today's taser

38:27.684 --> 38:30.100
but the voltage from
the wand would cause

38:30.135 --> 38:34.173
immediate cardiac arrest
and the victim's death

38:34.208 --> 38:37.280
would be attributed
to natural causes.

38:37.315 --> 38:39.800
We silenced countless
victims not only men

38:39.834 --> 38:42.596
but woman of all ages
and even teenagers.

38:44.080 --> 38:46.945
The following day after each
kill our memories were reset

38:46.979 --> 38:49.672
so we would have no
recollection of the murders.

38:51.398 --> 38:52.985
A good majority of
the victims were

38:53.020 --> 38:55.712
ufologists and whistle blowers.

38:56.886 --> 39:00.130
Among the ufologists I
personally silenced were

39:01.097 --> 39:02.685
Paul William Cooper,

39:03.651 --> 39:04.756
Milton Vigay,

39:05.826 --> 39:06.896
Claude Monroe,

39:08.207 --> 39:09.968
Anthony Vargas,

39:10.002 --> 39:13.143
and noted documentarian
Samantha Willis.

39:14.973 --> 39:17.424
When my wand malfunctioned
with Samantha

39:17.458 --> 39:19.184
I resorted to strangulation.

39:20.358 --> 39:23.222
She fought for a life
for almost two minutes.

39:23.257 --> 39:26.502
In recalling this act I
stared into her pleading eyes

39:26.536 --> 39:28.814
for the entire duration
with absolutely

39:28.849 --> 39:32.370
no remorse, guilt, or feelings.

39:33.785 --> 39:36.339
That was how effective
the mind conditioning was.

39:37.478 --> 39:39.687
And it's her face
that haunts my dreams

39:39.722 --> 39:41.586
more than anyone's to this day.

39:44.071 --> 39:46.418
- So they snuffed
out a documentarian?

39:46.453 --> 39:47.902
- Yep.

39:47.937 --> 39:49.110
- Well that's
not good to hear.

39:49.145 --> 39:51.975
- Yeah yeah alright
we're gonna move along.

39:52.010 --> 39:56.083
In 1954 Dwight Eisenhower signed

39:56.117 --> 40:00.570
what's known as the Grenada
Treaty with the alien gray race.

40:00.605 --> 40:03.470
In exchange for shared
alien technologies

40:03.504 --> 40:05.299
the Grays were allowed
to abduct a number

40:05.333 --> 40:07.922
of humans annually for
medical examination.

40:09.372 --> 40:12.410
The Grays also demanded
anonymity from the public.

40:12.444 --> 40:14.998
A short time later human
technology took a giant leap

40:15.033 --> 40:19.624
forward with circuit chips,
fiber optics, and lasers.

40:19.658 --> 40:21.936
The Grenada Treaty
is still active today

40:21.971 --> 40:24.525
but the number of human
abductions has increased

40:24.560 --> 40:27.321
despite objections from
the world governments.

40:29.185 --> 40:31.567
Now the really interesting part.

40:32.740 --> 40:34.742
Every year at least
8 million children

40:34.777 --> 40:36.813
go missing in the world.

40:36.848 --> 40:38.401
I can attest that
one third of them

40:38.436 --> 40:41.093
are abducted by
government operatives

40:41.128 --> 40:44.821
and transported to
any one of the 1477

40:45.857 --> 40:49.930
underground military
installations on the planet

40:49.964 --> 40:52.588
then imprisoned for the
remainder of their lives.

40:54.003 --> 40:56.177
The children are
subjected to biological

40:56.212 --> 40:59.491
and genetic experiments,
dissections and mutilations

40:59.526 --> 41:04.496
performed not by human scientists
but an alien gray species.

41:05.946 --> 41:07.706
During my stay at the
Vanguard Underground Base

41:07.741 --> 41:09.639
north of Phoenix, Arizona

41:09.674 --> 41:12.504
I witnessed many of
these procedures.

41:12.539 --> 41:14.541
Because there was no
form of anesthesia

41:14.575 --> 41:16.784
administered to
the young patients

41:16.819 --> 41:18.510
the halls reverberated
with the screams

41:18.545 --> 41:21.271
of tortured children from
morning through night.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.758
The ones that perished
were incinerated

41:24.792 --> 41:26.484
in the installations
crematoriums.

41:27.795 --> 41:29.452
My point of contact at this base

41:29.487 --> 41:33.283
was Lieutenant Colonel
Charles T, Lenninger

41:33.318 --> 41:36.148
and he was a human alien hybrid.

41:37.495 --> 41:38.772
And get ready for this.

41:40.290 --> 41:44.916
In 1994 the world population
summit in Cairo, Egypt

41:44.950 --> 41:49.334
had 160 nations participate
where they all agreed that

41:49.368 --> 41:53.338
the human population was out
of control and must be stopped

41:53.372 --> 41:55.651
because the world is
running out of resources.

41:56.755 --> 41:58.619
An agreement was formed
that would mandate

41:58.654 --> 42:01.898
the reduction of
humans from six billion

42:01.933 --> 42:05.730
to 800 million by the year 2030.

42:05.764 --> 42:07.732
This meant finding
a method or methods

42:07.766 --> 42:11.459
to wipe out nearly
95% of the population.

42:11.494 --> 42:14.255
Solutions were discovered,
investigated, tested

42:14.290 --> 42:17.673
then created and have
been in full force since.

42:17.707 --> 42:18.984
The procedures
have been inflicted

42:19.019 --> 42:21.953
onto the human race as follows.

42:23.299 --> 42:26.302
One, toxic levels of
chemically enhanced fluoride

42:26.336 --> 42:28.684
have been secretly added
to our drinking water

42:28.718 --> 42:31.341
over the last 20
years in every city

42:31.376 --> 42:32.964
and community on the planet.

42:34.310 --> 42:37.693
I personally oversaw the
delivery of fluoride barrels to

42:37.727 --> 42:42.732
Denver, Chicago, Tampa, and
Minneapolis water departments.

42:43.906 --> 42:45.804
The adverse effects
of fluoride poisoning

42:45.839 --> 42:49.049
to the human body are
numerous and debilitating.

42:50.188 --> 42:51.603
The effects on
children is damage

42:51.638 --> 42:53.605
to their neurological
development,

42:53.640 --> 42:55.711
among other serious ailments.

42:56.781 --> 43:01.337
Two, man made
viruses and diseases.

43:01.371 --> 43:04.167
The AIDS virus which
was a designer byproduct

43:04.202 --> 43:07.239
of the American Disease
Institute was distributed

43:07.274 --> 43:10.588
through vaccines to
the public in 1980.

43:10.622 --> 43:13.936
Instituted as a preliminary
population control tactic

43:13.970 --> 43:15.869
the results were
successful and led to more

43:15.903 --> 43:18.388
lab produced viruses
that have since

43:18.423 --> 43:20.425
been unleashed on to the public.

43:21.702 --> 43:24.947
Among those is the development
of a mutated version

43:24.981 --> 43:29.607
of the common flu to replicate
the 1918 influenza pandemic

43:29.641 --> 43:32.955
that killed 40 million people.

43:32.989 --> 43:34.819
The first strain in
this new flu virus

43:34.853 --> 43:39.099
will be released to the
public in late 2017.

43:40.548 --> 43:44.587
So if we see a flu outbreak
in the late 2017 or early 2018

43:44.622 --> 43:47.072
that's killing people
we'll know this is true.

43:49.557 --> 43:52.422
Three, killing us from
the air with neurotoxins,

43:54.528 --> 43:56.047
barium chloride,
cancer microbes,

43:56.081 --> 43:57.945
and viruses by way
of chem trails.

43:57.980 --> 44:00.016
Released into the
skies daily over all

44:00.051 --> 44:02.398
inhabited regions by
military aircraft.

44:03.882 --> 44:06.402
the effects of these toxins
are severe and over time lethal

44:06.436 --> 44:09.957
causing respiratory
ailments, cancer,

44:09.992 --> 44:13.858
damage to the immune systems,
and sterilization in men.

44:15.100 --> 44:17.068
Since the chem trail
plan was implemented

44:17.102 --> 44:21.313
sperm count in men has
dropped nearly 50%.

44:21.348 --> 44:23.143
If this isn't reversed soon

44:23.177 --> 44:25.697
the human race will
face early extinction.

44:26.905 --> 44:28.700
Now the grand finale.

44:28.735 --> 44:30.012
This is some scary shit.

44:32.014 --> 44:35.983
In March 1997 an event
known as the Phoenix Lights

44:36.018 --> 44:38.883
became the most infamous
UFO sighting in history.

44:40.056 --> 44:43.750
A mile wide vessel
clearly not man made

44:43.784 --> 44:47.305
flew slowly and silently
over the state of Arizona

44:47.339 --> 44:50.135
and was witnessed
by 10,000 people

44:50.170 --> 44:52.655
including the
governor of Arizona.

44:54.036 --> 44:57.695
To date there has been
no reasonable explanation

44:57.729 --> 44:59.524
but for every
witness interviewed

44:59.558 --> 45:02.872
the craft was as real as
anything they'd ever seen.

45:02.907 --> 45:04.563
Their lives were transformed.

45:04.598 --> 45:08.188
They now believe that
we truly are not alone.

45:08.222 --> 45:11.018
However, there is another truth

45:11.053 --> 45:13.365
for I know what they really saw.

45:14.781 --> 45:18.336
1986 while stationed at an
underground installation

45:18.370 --> 45:21.477
near Boulder, Colorado
I was introduced

45:21.511 --> 45:25.136
to Project Sky Beam by Lieutenant
General Andrew Garros.

45:26.516 --> 45:30.486
I was then led down a corridor
and into a large hangar

45:30.520 --> 45:34.317
where a stealth bomber
hovered only 20 feet above me.

45:34.352 --> 45:38.459
I stood there confused and
Garros looked over me and smiled

45:38.494 --> 45:41.083
then asked if I was certain
of what I was seeing.

45:42.463 --> 45:45.018
I replied of course
what else could it be?

45:46.502 --> 45:48.711
I was then shocked to
find out that this wasn't

45:48.746 --> 45:52.094
a real craft it was
a projected hologram.

45:53.267 --> 45:55.891
Since the early 1950's
scientists have been

45:55.925 --> 45:59.860
developing holographic
technology and over the years

45:59.895 --> 46:02.449
improved it to a state
that we can only imagine.

46:03.553 --> 46:05.521
As I stood there
staring at the bomber

46:05.555 --> 46:07.972
which looked so
absolutely real and solid

46:08.006 --> 46:09.732
that I could reach
up and touch it

46:10.837 --> 46:13.011
I contemplated
the possibilities.

46:13.046 --> 46:16.843
What if this projection was
1000 feet up in the sky?

46:16.877 --> 46:19.362
How would anyone know
that that was an illusion.

46:20.812 --> 46:23.159
The Phoenix Lights craft
witnessed by 10,000 people

46:23.194 --> 46:28.199
was the first grand scale Sky
Beam test upon the public.

46:29.303 --> 46:31.305
It succeeded beyond
expectations.

46:31.340 --> 46:34.653
In October 1938 Orson
Welles unleashed his

46:34.688 --> 46:38.243
War of the Worlds radio broadcast
to the American public.

46:38.278 --> 46:40.487
It was so
realistically portrayed

46:40.521 --> 46:43.835
vast portions of the
population went into panic.

46:43.870 --> 46:46.010
Terrified citizens scrambled

46:46.044 --> 46:48.288
to evacuate their
cities in droves.

46:48.322 --> 46:52.361
America had been easily
tricked by very simple means.

46:52.395 --> 46:55.226
To amplify this response
those who are truly in power

46:55.260 --> 46:59.713
in not only our country but
all the countries on the planet

46:59.747 --> 47:03.234
and who are the true purveyors
of the depopulation process

47:03.268 --> 47:06.237
have formulated the final
stage of their sinister plan.

47:07.341 --> 47:11.104
In the year 2024 a
global event will alter

47:11.138 --> 47:13.520
the course of mankind's future.

47:13.554 --> 47:17.351
The world will stand witness
to a massive alien invasion.

47:17.386 --> 47:20.734
Thousands of projected
holographic alien warships

47:20.768 --> 47:24.807
will blanket the skies sending
people into a global panic.

47:24.842 --> 47:28.190
Real military crafts within
the holograms will inflict

47:28.224 --> 47:31.193
actual damage to the surrounding
areas to sell the gimmick.

47:32.401 --> 47:35.404
And as result of the
ensuing human chaos

47:35.438 --> 47:39.442
a one world government
will immediately form

47:39.477 --> 47:42.273
without any resistance
from the people.

47:42.307 --> 47:44.551
They will be the
new world order.

47:45.759 --> 47:49.073
Once this happens we as
a people will be doomed

47:49.107 --> 47:52.007
to enslavement and
accelerated depopulation.

47:53.871 --> 47:58.496
With that said, the only
hope for human salvation

47:58.530 --> 48:01.499
is to acquire and
spread the knowledge

48:01.533 --> 48:03.466
of these activities and agendas.

48:04.847 --> 48:08.920
Resist, retaliate, and
conquer this imposing enemy.

48:08.955 --> 48:12.199
the time is now as humanity
is rapidly approaching

48:13.442 --> 48:14.477
its final days.

48:35.913 --> 48:38.812
The knowledge of what's coming
is taking its toll on me.

48:38.846 --> 48:42.367
I see all these people
living their lives,

48:43.541 --> 48:46.337
enjoying themselves,
planning their futures

48:48.028 --> 48:51.273
oblivious to the fact that
it's all going to end soon.

48:53.171 --> 48:55.208
Here I am at a park.

48:55.242 --> 48:57.900
The children are playing
and in the skies above

48:57.935 --> 49:01.697
I can see the chem
trails poisoning the air

49:01.731 --> 49:04.389
and slowly killing us
all in plain sight.

49:06.115 --> 49:07.634
I've never felt so helpless.

49:09.291 --> 49:10.948
I want to scream
out to the world but

49:10.982 --> 49:12.777
I'd only be laughed
at, ridiculed.

49:14.675 --> 49:17.195
When Claire said the
memoirs were a fabrication

49:17.230 --> 49:21.165
I secretly wished she was right
then I could sleep at night.

49:23.029 --> 49:25.928
But I know beyond a reasonable
doubt that it's all true

49:27.033 --> 49:29.518
that Joe was being
completely forthwith.

49:30.415 --> 49:31.761
I saw it in his eyes.

49:33.142 --> 49:35.420
I heard the tremor in his
voice when he spoke about it.

49:36.283 --> 49:38.251
Didn't come off as an admission.

49:38.285 --> 49:41.116
It's more of a deeply
concerned confession.

49:41.150 --> 49:44.671
He was scared for us
all and that says a lot

49:44.705 --> 49:47.294
coming from a man who was
a government assassin.

49:51.402 --> 49:54.025
Well I can't get ahold of Anne.

49:54.060 --> 49:55.578
She's not answering her phone.

49:57.028 --> 49:59.893
None of my texts, emails
nothing's being answered.

49:59.927 --> 50:02.206
Even her sister
lives in Utah though

50:02.240 --> 50:04.484
but she's been
trying to reach her.

50:04.518 --> 50:05.899
No calls, no nothing.

50:05.933 --> 50:07.073
I'm gonna have to go over there

50:07.107 --> 50:09.109
and find out what's
going on because

50:09.144 --> 50:11.077
something's wrong,
something's really wrong.

50:15.840 --> 50:17.152
Her car is here.

50:35.239 --> 50:37.896
Hey Charlie what you
doing buddy come here.

50:37.931 --> 50:40.416
Where's Mommy huh?

50:43.350 --> 50:44.179
Anne?

50:49.736 --> 50:50.564
Anne?

50:55.742 --> 50:56.536
Anne?

51:04.406 --> 51:05.200
Anne?

51:11.827 --> 51:13.208
The bed hasn't been slept in.

51:22.907 --> 51:24.909
- That's weird.

51:25.841 --> 51:27.394
- Anne.

51:27.429 --> 51:29.189
Charlie where's Anne?

51:41.028 --> 51:42.616
- The phone
is ringing from the,

51:42.651 --> 51:43.721
sounds like it ringing
from the bedroom.

51:49.416 --> 51:50.417
- This is her phone.

51:51.453 --> 51:52.350
- Oh wow.

51:55.181 --> 51:58.460
- What the heck is
this doing here?

51:58.494 --> 52:01.532
Okay so there's something
really wrong okay.

52:01.566 --> 52:04.259
I'm gonna, I'm
calling the police.

52:05.329 --> 52:06.882
I'm calling the police.

52:06.916 --> 52:09.056
- And file a
missing persons report.

52:09.091 --> 52:10.161
- Yeah.

52:10.196 --> 52:11.024
- Wow.

52:15.442 --> 52:16.961
- Alright I called the
police they're on their way.

52:16.995 --> 52:18.859
This poor dog hasn't eaten
in days have you Charlie?

52:18.894 --> 52:23.899
Come on there come on.

52:28.006 --> 52:30.285
They're on their way,
police are on their way.

52:35.738 --> 52:37.292
I hope they don't take forever.

52:38.534 --> 52:40.985
I'm having trouble
right now I'm sorry.

52:42.642 --> 52:46.404
I know I hope to God
nothing's happened to her

52:46.439 --> 52:48.958
over this stuff, these guys.

52:50.167 --> 52:52.962
If something happened
to her it's my fault,

52:52.997 --> 52:54.412
it's gonna be my fault I mean

52:57.933 --> 53:01.039
stupid I shoulda never,
shoulda never let

53:01.074 --> 53:02.524
Joe talk me into this.

53:04.215 --> 53:05.768
Something's happened to her.

53:09.082 --> 53:12.050
And it's not good I can
tell you that right now.

53:15.261 --> 53:16.469
Well we just left
Anne's and the police

53:16.503 --> 53:17.849
took their missing
persons report

53:17.884 --> 53:19.817
but refused to go on
camera for some reason.

53:19.851 --> 53:22.578
Go ahead tell them
what they did.

53:22.613 --> 53:23.993
- Well as
soon as they got there

53:24.028 --> 53:25.995
they saw me with the
camera and they walked over

53:26.030 --> 53:28.653
and told me to stop
filming and then

53:28.688 --> 53:32.174
they made me erase the
shots I did of them

53:32.209 --> 53:33.831
and watched me do
it on the spot.

53:35.246 --> 53:37.524
Well I don't know about you but
I got a weird vibe from them

53:37.559 --> 53:39.008
and did you notice when
they first got there

53:39.043 --> 53:42.115
the officer referred
to me as Mr. Keating.

53:42.149 --> 53:44.117
How did he know my last name?

53:44.151 --> 53:47.431
I only gave my first
name to the 911 operator.

53:47.465 --> 53:50.330
That's very very
suspicious if you ask me.

53:50.365 --> 53:51.573
- And I'm
wondering about the guy

53:51.607 --> 53:52.815
in the backseat
of the police car.

53:52.850 --> 53:54.576
Because he didn't have
a police uniform on.

53:54.610 --> 53:56.267
- Yeah that's right.

53:56.302 --> 53:57.510
I didn't get a
clear look at it him

53:57.544 --> 53:58.649
but he was not in
a police uniform

53:58.683 --> 54:00.858
and he was definitely
watching us.

54:00.892 --> 54:04.965
- So what
are you seeing?

54:06.691 --> 54:07.899
I think we're being followed.

54:09.867 --> 54:10.764
- Really?

54:19.048 --> 54:20.395
- Wasn't quite
sure but now I am.

54:23.984 --> 54:25.710
- Alright let's
see if he's following.

54:27.333 --> 54:28.195
Yep.

54:29.438 --> 54:30.819
Yep he's following us.

54:39.310 --> 54:40.794
- See there he is.

54:42.209 --> 54:46.213
I think he's been following
us since we left Anne's.

54:47.422 --> 54:48.664
- Why?

54:49.907 --> 54:50.908
- See?

54:52.185 --> 54:54.118
- Yep there he is.

54:56.879 --> 54:58.225
- You know what?

55:03.230 --> 55:04.404
Get out, get out.

55:04.439 --> 55:05.302
- Stop.

55:09.513 --> 55:10.341
- Hey.

55:11.377 --> 55:12.619
Why are you following me?

55:16.382 --> 55:17.175
Come on.

55:18.418 --> 55:19.281
Hey come here.

55:23.768 --> 55:25.356
Son of a.

55:25.391 --> 55:27.703
I bet anything he knows
what happened to Anne.

55:27.738 --> 55:29.395
Pisses me off the
son of a bitch.

55:31.017 --> 55:32.398
I'm fed up with this crap.

55:37.679 --> 55:39.646
- Hey.

55:39.681 --> 55:40.578
- You're not gonna believe this.

55:40.613 --> 55:42.028
I got something to show you.

55:45.100 --> 55:47.723
- What happened?

55:47.758 --> 55:48.621
- Let's go this way.

55:49.484 --> 55:51.520
I want to show you something.

55:51.555 --> 55:55.317
I just want you to see
okay I'm sorry I just.

55:58.803 --> 56:00.357
Well it ain't good.

56:17.615 --> 56:18.720
Look at that.

56:19.721 --> 56:22.517
This is what I walked in to.

56:22.551 --> 56:24.070
Could you imagine?

56:29.282 --> 56:30.110
- Wow.

56:31.318 --> 56:32.665
Your place got ransacked.

56:40.673 --> 56:44.262
It looks like they took
apart your bedroom.

56:45.643 --> 56:50.303
So you were gone
and what happened I mean?

56:51.649 --> 56:55.653
- Okay I was out doing
errands like I normally do.

56:56.896 --> 57:00.451
I come in here,
boom I see all this.

57:00.486 --> 57:02.522
- Are you
gonna call the police?

57:03.972 --> 57:06.008
- I thought about it but
what good is it going do?

57:06.043 --> 57:08.597
I know who did
this and by the way

57:08.632 --> 57:10.737
I don't even trust the police.

57:10.772 --> 57:12.843
She lives next door right.

57:12.877 --> 57:14.189
She's saying yeah two guys

57:15.777 --> 57:18.504
walking around back here,
back down around here.

57:20.920 --> 57:22.300
Went inside for awhile she said

57:22.335 --> 57:24.441
and then came back out
and they were gone.

57:25.580 --> 57:27.098
I don't know if anybody
else saw them or not.

57:27.133 --> 57:31.724
I don't know but I'll bet
anything it's our friends.

57:39.145 --> 57:41.458
I can't stay here
another minute.

57:42.389 --> 57:43.563
I gotta get out of here.

57:45.013 --> 57:46.255
- No I would too
I'd be getting out of here.

57:46.290 --> 57:49.189
- I know my life's in
danger, just I know.

57:49.224 --> 57:50.708
I'm gonna throw my phone away,

57:52.158 --> 57:56.507
find a place to go where
no one else knows but me.

57:56.542 --> 57:59.027
- Just
go into hiding or?

57:59.061 --> 58:01.512
- Yeah I'm just
gonna go underground.

58:01.547 --> 58:03.203
And I'll get in touch with you.

58:03.238 --> 58:04.239
- Okay.

58:11.280 --> 58:14.836
- I don't know how
they got in here.

58:14.870 --> 58:17.114
Neighbor saw the two men in
the dark suits that's it.

58:17.148 --> 58:18.736
She don't know what they
were doing, anything.

58:18.771 --> 58:20.013
Obviously it was them.

58:21.290 --> 58:22.809
And Anne's still missing.

58:25.260 --> 58:27.055
God only knows what
happened to her.

58:33.095 --> 58:34.890
There's no sense
in taking a chance.

58:34.925 --> 58:37.237
There's no sense
in staying here.

58:45.349 --> 58:47.247
I don't know, I don't
know what to do.

58:48.973 --> 58:50.423
- I think you're
doing the right thing.

58:50.457 --> 58:52.356
I think just going into
hiding and just laying low.

59:05.127 --> 59:07.129
- You know that
Anne's been missing right?

59:07.164 --> 59:08.786
- Yes.

59:08.821 --> 59:10.236
- And now
Tom has left town

59:10.270 --> 59:12.618
and you don't know where he is.

59:12.652 --> 59:15.586
- I've had no
correspondence with him no.

59:15.621 --> 59:18.416
- When's the
last time you saw him?

59:18.451 --> 59:19.970
- About two weeks ago.

59:20.004 --> 59:22.110
His place had been ransacked.

59:24.733 --> 59:27.598
- Oh come on
he did that themself.

59:27.633 --> 59:30.359
Either out of his own
delusion or a stupid ploy

59:30.394 --> 59:32.741
to convince everyone
why he had to leave

59:32.776 --> 59:36.089
because his life
was in danger right?

59:36.124 --> 59:38.022
- That's
how I understood it.

59:38.057 --> 59:39.990
- Well just so you know

59:40.024 --> 59:43.303
I have to tell the police
about Tom's mental condition

59:43.338 --> 59:45.892
and now it's very
likely that he'll be

59:45.927 --> 59:48.895
the primary suspect in
Anne's disappearance.

59:48.930 --> 59:52.589
So it's very important that
we find out where Tom is.

59:54.763 --> 59:57.283
- So who do I
contact if I hear from him?

59:58.595 --> 01:00:00.010
- Just call
me as soon as you do.

01:00:00.044 --> 01:00:02.840
I happen to be in communication
with the lead investigator.

01:00:03.910 --> 01:00:05.153
- Okay.

01:00:05.187 --> 01:00:06.879
- Robert
you do understand

01:00:06.913 --> 01:00:09.295
that if you're concealing
his whereabouts

01:00:09.329 --> 01:00:11.746
and not telling me
what else you know

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:15.888
that you're an accomplice
to very serious crime.

01:00:15.922 --> 01:00:18.787
I wouldn't want to see
you go to prison over this

01:00:18.822 --> 01:00:22.515
because that is what will
happen if you're lying.

01:00:23.689 --> 01:00:25.587
I'll be expecting
your call, good bye.

01:00:39.290 --> 01:00:40.637
- This is Hal
Camillo speaking to you

01:00:40.671 --> 01:00:42.673
from the Jackson County
Sheriff's Department

01:00:42.708 --> 01:00:45.676
here in downtown Pascagoula
where this morning

01:00:45.711 --> 01:00:48.403
we had an interrogation
or interview

01:00:48.437 --> 01:00:51.061
with two of these
gentlemen that reportedly

01:00:51.095 --> 01:00:53.304
sighted and were
taken aboard a UFO

01:00:54.547 --> 01:00:57.550
late last night in
the Gautier area.

01:00:57.584 --> 01:00:59.586
- It landed
approximately two feet

01:00:59.621 --> 01:01:01.485
off the ground it never
touched the ground

01:01:01.519 --> 01:01:05.316
and two creatures came out
and carried the men aboard.

01:01:05.351 --> 01:01:07.008
- Regarding the
truthfulness of his statement

01:01:07.042 --> 01:01:10.045
that he saw a space ship,
three space creatures,

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:12.979
and was taken into the
spaceship on October 11, 1973.

01:01:13.014 --> 01:01:15.775
It is my opinion that
Charles Hickson told

01:01:15.810 --> 01:01:17.812
the truth when he
stated number one

01:01:17.846 --> 01:01:20.815
that he believed he
saw a space ship.

01:01:20.849 --> 01:01:23.334
Number two he believed
he was taken into

01:01:23.369 --> 01:01:25.474
this spaceship and
number three that

01:01:25.509 --> 01:01:28.305
he believed he saw
three space creatures.

01:01:28.339 --> 01:01:31.273
- It hovered about
three feet off the ground.

01:01:31.308 --> 01:01:35.208
three creatures who were described
as about five feet tall

01:01:35.243 --> 01:01:38.073
with big eyes, pointed
ears, wrinkled skin,

01:01:39.523 --> 01:01:41.836
a pale colored skin, they
had claw like arms and feet

01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:44.839
came out and they
hovered or floated.

01:01:44.873 --> 01:01:48.083
they didn't walk they
kind of floated out

01:01:48.118 --> 01:01:51.638
and suspended him in midair
with nothing to hold him up

01:01:51.673 --> 01:01:53.744
except that he was
weightless and they took

01:01:53.779 --> 01:01:58.749
this big eye looking
object and went over him.

01:01:59.923 --> 01:02:01.165
I guess you'd say
like an X-ray like you

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:03.754
take an X-ray or take
a picture of it him.

01:02:05.273 --> 01:02:06.792
- And it seemed
something like a big eye.

01:02:06.826 --> 01:02:08.276
I keep referring to it is an eye

01:02:08.310 --> 01:02:11.175
because it was about
side of a small baseball.

01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:12.901
And the end that was
focused toward me

01:02:12.936 --> 01:02:15.283
was a different color
or a different light.

01:02:15.317 --> 01:02:16.698
- So once
the craft deposited

01:02:16.733 --> 01:02:18.458
you and Calvin back on the bank

01:02:18.493 --> 01:02:20.771
without any further
ado it just departed.

01:02:20.806 --> 01:02:22.393
- It departed
that's right, it departed.

01:02:22.428 --> 01:02:25.327
The Air Force won't
talk about those things.

01:02:25.362 --> 01:02:27.088
They didn't even want to talk,

01:02:27.122 --> 01:02:30.332
you know they didn't want
to talk with us about it.

01:02:30.367 --> 01:02:32.956
- Were you afraid
during this entire thing?

01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:36.822
- I certainly
was and I can explain that.

01:02:36.856 --> 01:02:38.651
Just normal fear is
something that you expect

01:02:38.685 --> 01:02:42.344
if you're on this Earth
but this was something that

01:02:42.379 --> 01:02:44.933
wasn't supposed to even exist.

01:02:44.968 --> 01:02:47.487
And it's fear that you
can't even explain.

01:03:55.417 --> 01:03:57.109
- Were you followed?

01:03:57.143 --> 01:03:59.766
- No I don't think
so I didn't see anybody.

01:04:00.698 --> 01:04:02.597
I brought your groceries.

01:04:02.631 --> 01:04:06.290
- Oh thank God I
haven't for two days.

01:04:07.809 --> 01:04:08.637
- Wow.

01:04:12.262 --> 01:04:14.436
So there's no electricity here?

01:04:14.471 --> 01:04:15.886
- No they're renovating.

01:04:15.921 --> 01:04:17.681
- Oh okay
whose house is this?

01:04:17.715 --> 01:04:19.476
- Anne's brother's.

01:04:19.510 --> 01:04:20.926
You haven't met him yet.

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:22.030
- Oh the guy
that was at the party.

01:04:22.962 --> 01:04:25.792
- Needed a place
to hide out so I

01:04:25.827 --> 01:04:27.001
come up here a couple days ago.

01:04:27.035 --> 01:04:28.485
I had to break into the place.

01:04:28.519 --> 01:04:30.142
He doesn't even
know I'm up here.

01:04:34.042 --> 01:04:36.665
- Yeah I just
grabbed whatever I could.

01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:37.528
- I was

01:04:39.703 --> 01:04:41.705
up in Colorado Springs,
stayed with a friend of mine.

01:04:41.739 --> 01:04:42.982
- The guy you
set the memoirs to.

01:04:43.017 --> 01:04:44.570
- Yeah right I give him a call.

01:04:44.604 --> 01:04:46.917
He doesn't answer,
some guy answers.

01:04:46.952 --> 01:04:50.645
Won't give me his name, wants
my name wants my phone number.

01:04:50.679 --> 01:04:52.785
- Did you
call him and then

01:04:52.819 --> 01:04:54.166
some other person answered?

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:56.375
- Yeah right I didn't
like it I hung up.

01:04:56.409 --> 01:04:57.686
- Holy--

01:04:57.721 --> 01:04:59.205
- Yeah so.

01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:00.620
Do you know what?

01:05:00.655 --> 01:05:02.622
They got rid of my
buddy, wanted me to call,

01:05:02.657 --> 01:05:05.246
traced that call, and
I said you know what?

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:07.834
I'm high tailing it out of here.

01:05:07.869 --> 01:05:10.458
I think something
bad happened to Anne.

01:05:10.492 --> 01:05:13.702
Everybody else that's been
involved in this fiasco

01:05:13.737 --> 01:05:16.188
they're either
disappeared or dead.

01:05:16.222 --> 01:05:17.844
Listen if I were you okay I get

01:05:17.879 --> 01:05:20.364
this documentary
done and completed.

01:05:20.399 --> 01:05:23.436
And I'd get it released free
and never see the past again.

01:05:23.471 --> 01:05:26.025
Get your face and name out
there and then you'll be safe.

01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:27.406
You know what I mean?

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:29.615
This is what I'm gonna do.

01:05:30.996 --> 01:05:33.584
I'm gonna head up north to
Canada and I'm gonna disappear

01:05:33.619 --> 01:05:36.311
in those big woods that
they have up there.

01:05:38.417 --> 01:05:39.901
It that's possible.

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:42.007
But I hope I can
find someone that'll

01:05:42.041 --> 01:05:44.147
release the memoirs up there.

01:05:44.181 --> 01:05:45.769
- Right.

01:05:45.803 --> 01:05:48.945
So why don't you just turn
yourself into the police

01:05:48.979 --> 01:05:51.085
or commit some
kind of petty crime

01:05:51.119 --> 01:05:53.984
and just sit in a police
cell I mean or a jail cell.

01:05:54.019 --> 01:05:56.090
You'd be much safer.

01:05:56.124 --> 01:05:57.332
- Police, police?

01:05:57.367 --> 01:05:59.024
I wouldn't last 10
minutes before they

01:05:59.058 --> 01:06:00.922
whisked me out of
there and who knows

01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:05.547
where I'd wind up some not
seen base or even worse.

01:06:05.582 --> 01:06:07.273
That's the worst
thing I could do.

01:06:08.171 --> 01:06:10.104
I need to protect myself now.

01:06:10.138 --> 01:06:12.313
Don't freak out when
I show you this okay.

01:06:14.073 --> 01:06:14.971
- Oh wow.

01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:18.146
- Yeah I bought it at
the local gun store today.

01:06:20.493 --> 01:06:22.357
And I'm not afraid to use it.

01:06:22.392 --> 01:06:23.876
I can defend my life.

01:06:25.291 --> 01:06:26.879
- Do you think you
could actually shoot somebody?

01:06:26.913 --> 01:06:28.156
- I'm a Vietnam vet.

01:06:28.191 --> 01:06:31.228
Like I said I don't
mind protecting myself.

01:06:31.263 --> 01:06:35.784
And these guys wanna have
it out before I go out

01:06:35.819 --> 01:06:37.890
I'll go out guns a blazing.

01:06:39.305 --> 01:06:41.031
- Well hopefully
it doesn't come to that.

01:06:45.035 --> 01:06:46.312
What the hell is?

01:06:46.347 --> 01:06:47.175
- Who could that be?

01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:48.694
- I don't know.

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:52.042
- Why don't you go upstairs?

01:06:52.077 --> 01:06:54.493
Go upstairs and keep filming.

01:07:04.468 --> 01:07:05.987
- Tom hi.

01:07:10.302 --> 01:07:11.751
I need to talk to you.

01:07:11.786 --> 01:07:14.168
- What are you doing here?

01:07:14.202 --> 01:07:17.067
- I need to talk
to you about Anne.

01:07:19.207 --> 01:07:20.553
So where's Anne?

01:07:21.934 --> 01:07:23.625
- That's a good question.

01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:24.868
I have no idea.

01:07:24.902 --> 01:07:27.181
I been looking for
her for forever.

01:07:27.215 --> 01:07:29.631
- Listen you have
to come with me.

01:07:29.666 --> 01:07:31.081
- Are you crazy?

01:07:31.116 --> 01:07:32.738
There are guys out
there trying to kill me.

01:07:32.772 --> 01:07:34.015
- You don't know that.

01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:35.465
We both know you're
gonna be in trouble.

01:07:35.499 --> 01:07:38.606
Don't you understand coming
here just makes you look guilty?

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:40.159
What about Anne?

01:07:40.194 --> 01:07:42.920
- Anne, I didn't do
anything to Anne.

01:07:42.955 --> 01:07:44.370
I'm trying to save her--

01:07:44.405 --> 01:07:47.994
- Listen it's very important
that you talk to me now.

01:07:48.029 --> 01:07:50.411
So we can go together, be safe,

01:07:50.445 --> 01:07:52.654
and I have a great
doctor for you.

01:07:52.689 --> 01:07:54.139
I talked to him already.

01:07:54.173 --> 01:07:57.349
- Claire listen, I am not
crazy do you understand?

01:07:57.383 --> 01:07:59.558
I'm not imagining this.

01:07:59.592 --> 01:08:01.491
- No one's saying
that you're crazy.

01:08:01.525 --> 01:08:04.494
- I'm not going anywhere, not
that and I want you to leave.

01:08:04.528 --> 01:08:05.357
I want to get out of here.

01:08:05.391 --> 01:08:07.290
- What's that?

01:08:15.574 --> 01:08:17.058
- What's it to you?

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:18.024
- Oh shit.

01:08:20.957 --> 01:08:21.787
Whoa.

01:08:36.629 --> 01:08:37.527
- Robert?

01:08:40.392 --> 01:08:41.393
Come on down.

01:08:47.157 --> 01:08:48.814
I know you're there.

01:08:51.437 --> 01:08:52.265
Robert?

01:08:56.477 --> 01:08:58.962
Are you gonna make me come up?

01:08:58.996 --> 01:09:00.170
Fine.

01:09:00.205 --> 01:09:02.241
- Oh shit, shit.

01:09:09.386 --> 01:09:10.904
- Robert.

01:09:12.975 --> 01:09:13.804
Robert?

01:09:14.978 --> 01:09:16.497
Come on.

01:09:16.531 --> 01:09:18.188
There's no sense hiding from me.

01:09:26.127 --> 01:09:26.955
Robert?

01:09:28.647 --> 01:09:31.443
I'm not going to hurt you.

01:09:31.477 --> 01:09:32.305
Robert?

01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:34.549
Come out.

01:09:43.247 --> 01:09:45.215
Yeah I have it.

01:09:45.250 --> 01:09:46.665
I'll come down
and open the door.

01:10:01.576 --> 01:10:02.750
- Yes I'd
like to report a fire.

01:10:02.784 --> 01:10:05.511
There's a fire at
421 South Oak Street.

01:10:06.995 --> 01:10:09.239
And there's two men inside
the house starting a fire.

01:10:09.274 --> 01:10:11.379
I need you to get the fire
trucks here immediately.

01:10:11.414 --> 01:10:14.279
The whole house is
gonna go up in flames.

01:10:14.313 --> 01:10:15.935
Please hurry.

01:12:48.156 --> 01:12:50.745
- Very smart
to call the Fire Department.

01:13:00.134 --> 01:13:03.102
We were at your place today.

01:13:03.137 --> 01:13:07.383
We confiscated your computer,
your external drives.

01:13:08.418 --> 01:13:09.937
We have everything.

01:13:11.525 --> 01:13:14.597
There's nowhere you can
run, nowhere you can hide.

01:13:16.150 --> 01:13:17.047
We will find you.

01:13:19.912 --> 01:13:21.086
I'll take that.
