WEBVTT

00:27.528 --> 00:29.154
Yeah, see how she's drifting?

00:30.239 --> 00:32.156
That's 'cause you're going
too slow against the current.

00:32.156 --> 00:34.243
So you're gonna wanna give
a little love to the throttle.

00:34.243 --> 00:36.411
Okay.
-Just a smidge. Not too much.

00:39.581 --> 00:40.666
See.

00:41.250 --> 00:43.710
Current's pushing us too hard.
We have to push back harder.

00:43.710 --> 00:46.255
Otherwise, river just takes us
where it wants us to go.

00:46.255 --> 00:47.339
Got it.

00:52.511 --> 00:55.681
Dad. Get it off me. Get it off.
-Yeah. Relax.

01:00.018 --> 01:01.019
It's a cricket.

01:17.494 --> 01:18.620
Easy.

01:19.204 --> 01:21.623
That's it. There you go. All right.

01:21.623 --> 01:23.917
Let me get my hands off it.
What's going on?

01:23.917 --> 01:25.002
Dad?

01:25.002 --> 01:26.086
Can you hear that?

01:26.628 --> 01:27.629
Yeah.

01:27.629 --> 01:29.089
You good?
-Sure.

01:30.299 --> 01:33.594
Don't touch this one.
-Dad. Okay, I've got it. Okay.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.096
Margot! Anchor!
-I've got it.

01:52.988 --> 01:55.407
Wanna try it?
-No.

01:56.074 --> 01:57.910
Are you sure?
-Pretty sure.

02:00.078 --> 02:02.122
So what, it's just busted?

02:02.998 --> 02:04.249
The intake? Nah.

02:04.249 --> 02:06.627
The river is so filled
with all kinds of crap.

02:06.627 --> 02:09.630
But the engine needs the water
to cool itself.

02:11.131 --> 02:15.302
Kind of like a elephant spraying itself.
-Uh-huh.

02:15.302 --> 02:18.222
Well, that elephant has bad sinuses.

02:19.389 --> 02:23.018
It needs us
to help it blow its nose, right?

02:23.018 --> 02:25.187
That way, it keeps the engine cool.

02:28.732 --> 02:31.151
Will you take care of that for me?
-Yeah.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.124
Dina, you see that?

02:47.543 --> 02:48.544
See what?

02:49.378 --> 02:50.420
That.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.130
Is that an alligator?

02:53.257 --> 02:54.299
It's a crocodile.

02:55.342 --> 02:56.426
Like there's a difference.

02:56.426 --> 02:57.553
There's a difference.

02:58.053 --> 02:59.054
Not to me.

02:59.054 --> 03:01.098
Come on. Get back to work, please.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.106
So, has he talked to you about it yet?

03:10.858 --> 03:11.859
About what?

03:12.901 --> 03:14.862
The guy.
-Back at the beach town?

03:17.447 --> 03:18.532
It's okay, honey.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.367
You can say it. The man he killed.

03:21.159 --> 03:22.536
We don't know he died.

03:23.370 --> 03:24.621
He's dead, sweetheart.

03:25.956 --> 03:26.957
Okay?

03:29.626 --> 03:30.627
Try it now!

03:42.514 --> 03:44.266
Shit. Mom.

03:46.852 --> 03:48.312
Yeah, shit.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.047
Dad? Are we gonna be okay?

04:18.466 --> 04:20.719
I don't know.
I think we should wait this one out.

04:30.938 --> 04:31.939
Mom's right.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.900
We need to find a sheltered spot.
Ride this out.

04:48.413 --> 04:49.706
Fuck.

04:56.672 --> 04:57.714
Fuck.

05:12.729 --> 05:15.607
Charlie! Can you see anywhere to pull in?

05:16.984 --> 05:18.235
I'll check!

05:26.743 --> 05:28.287
I can't see anything!

05:42.384 --> 05:43.468
Put it on.

05:47.890 --> 05:49.266
No!

05:49.266 --> 05:50.684
Charlie!

05:52.394 --> 05:53.395
No.

05:57.900 --> 05:58.901
Charlie!

06:02.696 --> 06:05.824
Put this on.
-Put on your life jackets, quick!

06:09.369 --> 06:11.288
Shit. What?

06:19.755 --> 06:21.715
Wait. Watch out. One o'clock.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.008
I see it.
-See it?

06:41.401 --> 06:43.570
Look, right there! Over there! Pull it in!

07:03.257 --> 07:04.633
Come on, come on.

07:14.560 --> 07:15.853
Fuck.

07:20.816 --> 07:23.735
Now we're drifting. No, no!

07:25.571 --> 07:27.948
Damn it!
-Jesus.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.658
Charlie, the engine room!

07:45.048 --> 07:46.049
Give me the bucket.

08:01.356 --> 08:02.858
Mom! We're gonna hit!

08:03.442 --> 08:05.152
Starboard or port?

08:06.778 --> 08:08.739
Right! Let's go right!
-Left or right?

08:12.159 --> 08:13.285
Go right!

08:13.285 --> 08:14.536
I can't turn it!

08:15.662 --> 08:16.663
Allie!

08:21.960 --> 08:23.253
Try it again!

08:32.304 --> 08:33.304
Fuck.

08:34.972 --> 08:36.475
Get a wire brush!
-Where?

08:37.183 --> 08:38.184
In the tool kit!

08:47.069 --> 08:48.237
Mom! The rock!

08:51.365 --> 08:53.700
Shit. Oh, my God.
Dina, you gotta brace yourself!

08:53.700 --> 08:56.078
Brace yourself! Go down. Hit the floor!

08:56.078 --> 08:57.287
Allie! Brace!

08:58.288 --> 08:59.540
Try it again!

09:25.399 --> 09:26.400
Try it again!

09:33.073 --> 09:34.074
Try it again!

09:42.124 --> 09:43.292
We got it!

09:44.751 --> 09:45.752
Good.

09:48.672 --> 09:52.134
I'm gonna pull into the cove.
Just hold on to me. Hold on.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.309
We're gonna hit the bank!

12:07.686 --> 12:08.687
Shit.

12:17.321 --> 12:19.031
All the runoff's gonna
keep the water rising.

12:19.031 --> 12:22.409
If we don't get her afloat,
engine room's gonna flood.

12:22.951 --> 12:24.494
So, we're fucked.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.955
Dina.
-Screwed.

12:26.955 --> 12:29.666
It's an issue. It's a problem.

12:30.626 --> 12:32.085
So what's the good news?

12:32.085 --> 12:33.504
That is the good news.

12:34.546 --> 12:37.716
Got a few hours, I guess,
before the water reaches the breach.

12:37.716 --> 12:39.468
That's enough time to get her afloat.

12:39.468 --> 12:41.929
Get the hole above the waterline,
then we just patch her up.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.096
How do we do it?

12:44.765 --> 12:45.766
Fishing winch.

12:46.975 --> 12:49.144
Just hook her up, haul her onto the water.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.775
Is it strong enough?
-Sure!

12:54.775 --> 12:57.653
"Give me a lever long enough
and a fulcrum on which to place it,

12:57.653 --> 12:59.613
and I shall move the world."

12:59.613 --> 13:00.697
Who said that?

13:01.240 --> 13:02.241
Archimedes.

13:03.575 --> 13:04.576
What's that smoke?

13:06.537 --> 13:08.455
It's an oil rig.
-Out here?

13:09.706 --> 13:11.625
Everywhere. Like a cancer.

13:48.954 --> 13:50.330
Are you okay?

13:51.248 --> 13:52.624
Uh-huh. Yeah.

13:53.375 --> 13:54.376
Fine.

14:56.104 --> 14:57.105
Dina.

14:58.732 --> 14:59.775
Look.

15:05.239 --> 15:08.534
Allie, get out of the water.

15:08.534 --> 15:10.744
Dad! Come on!
-Dad! Get out of the water!

15:10.744 --> 15:12.246
Dad, hurry!
-Dad!

15:14.581 --> 15:16.500
Dad, hurry!
-Faster!

15:17.543 --> 15:19.294
Dad, come on!
-Get out of the water.

15:19.294 --> 15:21.129
Dad! Hurry! Come on!
-Come on!

15:21.129 --> 15:22.464
Dad! Come on!
-Come on!

15:23.423 --> 15:24.800
Get out the water!
-Dad! Hurry!

15:24.800 --> 15:26.260
Come on. Dad, get out!

15:26.260 --> 15:27.719
Margot, the winch!

15:39.982 --> 15:41.066
Dad.

15:46.196 --> 15:47.573
Oh, my God.

15:50.284 --> 15:53.203
Jesus. It's okay.

16:03.255 --> 16:04.923
You ready?
-Yeah.

16:08.218 --> 16:09.761
Dad, are you okay?

16:12.222 --> 16:14.308
Yeah. I'm great.

16:15.809 --> 16:17.144
You're all good on the winch?

16:19.438 --> 16:21.815
Okay. Take it away, honey bear.

16:42.127 --> 16:43.837
Dad, I think it's gonna snap!

16:44.505 --> 16:46.173
Be fine! Keep going!

17:00.771 --> 17:02.189
She's moving!

17:07.194 --> 17:10.196
See. What I tell you?

17:29.967 --> 17:31.593
We broke a tree.

17:40.894 --> 17:42.271
Dad!
-Jesus! Dad!

17:42.271 --> 17:44.106
Dad, are you okay?

17:44.106 --> 17:45.566
Get some water!
-Dad, are you okay?

17:46.859 --> 17:47.985
Oh, my God.

17:47.985 --> 17:49.987
Mom, what's wrong?
-He's burning up.

17:49.987 --> 17:51.154
Is he okay?

17:51.154 --> 17:53.365
I don't know.
-Here. Take this.

17:53.991 --> 17:55.784
Please help. What?

17:57.494 --> 17:59.162
What the fuck is that?

18:03.000 --> 18:07.045
It could be these bugs.
They're, like-- They're all over here.

18:07.045 --> 18:09.173
I think they give you, like,
parasites in your blood.

18:09.173 --> 18:10.465
What?
-Is he gonna get better?

18:10.465 --> 18:14.845
No, I don't think so. If it's like Chagas
or something, then we need medicine.

18:14.845 --> 18:16.471
Okay. So what happens?

18:16.972 --> 18:19.183
I think, like, heart failure or something?

18:19.183 --> 18:21.602
Immediately? Like, how fast?

18:21.602 --> 18:23.979
It's not so good. Worse over time.

18:28.317 --> 18:29.902
It's pretty bad, right?

18:32.029 --> 18:33.113
Yeah. It's pretty bad.

18:35.407 --> 18:36.491
So what happens if...

18:41.288 --> 18:42.539
How common is this thing?

18:42.539 --> 18:44.583
The parasite?
-Yeah, whatever it's called.

18:44.583 --> 18:45.667
It's really common.

18:45.667 --> 18:48.754
And it's treatable?
-Yeah, with the right medicine.

18:51.340 --> 18:53.967
You know, an oil rig that remote,

18:53.967 --> 18:56.762
I mean, surely they have medication
for anything endemic.

18:56.762 --> 19:00.349
But we're not supposed to go.
And we can't be seen.

19:00.349 --> 19:03.810
You're not gonna be seen.
I need you to stay here, okay?

19:04.353 --> 19:07.523
And patch up the hole in the boat.
Otherwise, the engine room will flood.

19:07.523 --> 19:10.651
Ho-- I mean, how?
With spit and a glitter stick?

19:10.651 --> 19:14.196
Half your brain comes from him.
What would he do?

19:29.545 --> 19:33.799
Hey, Dina? Will you keep this for me?

19:34.466 --> 19:35.717
Yeah.
-It's Dad's watch.

19:37.261 --> 19:38.512
Just until I get back.

19:41.181 --> 19:42.266
Let's go.

19:55.153 --> 19:56.154
You got this.

20:45.037 --> 20:46.038
Seriously?

20:52.294 --> 20:54.546
Come on. There must be something.

21:26.453 --> 21:27.829
What am I supposed to do with this shit?

21:33.335 --> 21:34.795
Dad, I need your help.

21:36.255 --> 21:37.339
Dad.

21:43.053 --> 21:44.054
Dad?

21:48.058 --> 21:49.476
Shit, Dad.

21:53.105 --> 21:54.189
Fuck.

21:59.862 --> 22:00.863
Hey.

22:02.656 --> 22:04.783
Hey, honey.
-Drink some water, okay?

22:06.368 --> 22:07.202
Here.

22:09.454 --> 22:10.622
Oh, no. Sorry.

22:10.622 --> 22:11.707
Sorry.

22:29.641 --> 22:30.684
Fuck.

22:45.866 --> 22:48.660
When we get there,
we're gonna have to be careful,

22:48.660 --> 22:51.246
because places like that
tend to have a lot of security.

22:51.872 --> 22:53.081
What kind of security?

22:53.874 --> 22:54.875
Men with guns.

22:56.043 --> 22:58.253
Why would you need guns
all the way out here?

22:58.253 --> 23:00.005
I mean, there's no people.

23:00.005 --> 23:01.798
All the big predators are pretty shy.

23:01.798 --> 23:05.427
It's not like they're gonna go towards
what's basically a base.

23:06.011 --> 23:08.889
Yeah, big corporations come out here.
You know, multinationals.

23:08.889 --> 23:10.349
And they tear the place to pieces.

23:10.349 --> 23:12.476
The local people
don't want that to happen.

23:12.476 --> 23:13.560
It's their land.

23:14.353 --> 23:17.272
But they can't afford the legal action
they need to take on a big corporation.

23:17.272 --> 23:18.565
But how do they stop it?

23:19.358 --> 23:20.692
Right? It's difficult.

23:21.652 --> 23:24.571
You know, the law only tends to be
on the side of the right kind of person,

23:24.571 --> 23:26.156
the kind with deep pockets.

23:26.698 --> 23:29.952
So, the way they see it,
there is no other way but to use violence.

23:34.581 --> 23:37.793
So, what do you think?
Do you think it's okay?

23:38.335 --> 23:40.003
To use violence?
-Yeah.

23:41.630 --> 23:43.590
Sometimes I kind of do, yes.

23:43.590 --> 23:48.345
I think if your cause is a good one
and if you're left with no other choice.

23:48.345 --> 23:50.639
In fact, sometimes I think
it's more than okay.

23:50.639 --> 23:52.099
Sometimes it's an obligation.

23:52.808 --> 23:54.643
It's so hot. I need a second.

23:58.146 --> 23:59.147
What about you?

24:02.150 --> 24:03.151
What do you think?

24:05.028 --> 24:07.531
About that guy? On the beach?

24:09.491 --> 24:11.410
Look, if you're not ready
to talk about it...

24:15.706 --> 24:19.585
I don't know how to talk about it.
I don't know what I'm supposed to say.

24:21.044 --> 24:24.840
Maybe how it makes you feel?
That's a good place to start, right?

24:29.428 --> 24:30.512
Do you think about him?

24:32.264 --> 24:33.265
Not really.

24:34.558 --> 24:37.102
I mean, sometimes.

24:37.102 --> 24:39.521
Okay, so when you do think about him,
what do you think?

24:42.149 --> 24:46.528
I mean, I actually--
I do think about him a lot.

24:48.488 --> 24:49.781
I know he's gone, but, like...

24:51.783 --> 24:53.827
I dream about him almost every night.

24:55.120 --> 24:56.830
Like, the face he made and everything.

24:59.208 --> 25:01.543
It's weird. In some ways,
it was actually, like, kind of funny.

25:05.297 --> 25:09.259
But sometimes I just think
it's basically, like, nature, you know?

25:10.636 --> 25:12.054
Okay, nature in what way?

25:12.054 --> 25:15.390
Like how strong things live,
and weak things die.

25:16.725 --> 25:17.726
Yeah.

25:19.811 --> 25:21.188
I just keep thinking, like--

25:21.188 --> 25:23.023
like everything he ever did

25:24.233 --> 25:29.321
or thought or remembered is gone.

25:30.531 --> 25:33.325
His girlfriends. His mom and dad.

25:34.618 --> 25:36.370
The first time he learned
how to ride a bike.

25:36.370 --> 25:37.829
All of that is just gone.

25:38.330 --> 25:39.748
I don't know. It's just like...

25:41.750 --> 25:44.711
popping a balloon,
and then it's just gone forever.

25:45.921 --> 25:47.172
He's gone.

25:48.298 --> 25:51.927
I don't know. I guess that just, like,
kind of goes around and around in my head.

25:54.096 --> 25:57.474
I mean, honey, there's no right way
to react to something like that.

25:58.517 --> 26:01.645
It takes time. And it hurts.

26:03.522 --> 26:05.148
Sometimes, you feel as if you're falling.

26:05.148 --> 26:08.735
Like you're-- you can't breathe.
And you panic.

26:09.528 --> 26:11.905
And you think, "If I could just go back
and do one thing differently,

26:11.905 --> 26:15.200
just one thing,
maybe it never would have happened."

26:23.917 --> 26:27.296
Look at me. It gets better every day.

26:27.296 --> 26:29.840
Just a little bit every day.

26:30.507 --> 26:31.508
You think?

26:35.512 --> 26:36.513
I know.

26:46.440 --> 26:48.192
I'm so sorry this happened to you.

26:49.693 --> 26:50.694
It breaks my heart

26:50.694 --> 26:53.280
that I wasn't there for you
when you needed me the most.

26:55.324 --> 27:00.913
But you stepped up. You were so brave,
and I'm so proud of you.

27:01.747 --> 27:04.416
And I love you so, so much. We all do.

27:27.272 --> 27:28.649
Come on. Let's go save your dad.

27:41.411 --> 27:42.412
Fuck.

27:50.295 --> 27:51.296
Okay.

28:05.018 --> 28:07.646
Fuck. Son of a bitch!

28:10.983 --> 28:12.192
Oh, my God.

30:21.029 --> 30:22.447
Hey.

30:24.741 --> 30:26.743
Hey, hey.

30:26.743 --> 30:28.203
It's okay.

30:37.296 --> 30:38.297
Hey.

30:39.464 --> 30:40.465
Hey.
-Hey.

30:50.184 --> 30:52.144
They're gonna be back soon. Okay?

31:11.622 --> 31:12.623
Where is everyone?

31:16.919 --> 31:17.920
I don't know.

32:58.395 --> 32:59.396
Just stay here.

34:16.223 --> 34:19.226
Come on. Let's get out of here.
Whoever did this might still be here.

34:19.226 --> 34:20.768
No, I don't think so.

34:21.812 --> 34:22.813
Nobody's here.

34:25.732 --> 34:27.525
The blood's been dry a while.

34:27.525 --> 34:28.610
It's safe.

34:30.862 --> 34:33.197
I mean, we still have to get
the medicine for Dad, right?

34:36.076 --> 34:38.620
Okay, let's check
the rec room or the mess hut.

34:39.830 --> 34:40.831
Let's go.

35:33.509 --> 35:35.719
What do you think happened here?
-I don't know.

35:36.553 --> 35:38.972
It's all fucked up,
but they didn't take anything.

35:39.765 --> 35:41.391
They wanted the dynamite.

35:44.686 --> 35:45.687
Fucking nothing.

35:49.441 --> 35:50.442
It's not here.

35:56.823 --> 35:57.824
Charlie!

36:12.005 --> 36:13.507
It's gotta be one of these.

36:17.636 --> 36:18.971
Is that it?

36:18.971 --> 36:20.055
I don't know.

36:22.891 --> 36:24.476
Yeah, this is it.

37:09.146 --> 37:10.147
Fuck.

37:44.431 --> 37:45.557
Dad!

37:47.267 --> 37:48.519
Dad, I think I did it!

38:01.240 --> 38:02.241
Dad?

38:57.796 --> 38:58.797
Hey.

39:00.215 --> 39:01.300
You're kinda cold.

39:03.093 --> 39:05.888
You used to do this for me
when I was sick.

39:05.888 --> 39:09.558
Tuck me in all nice and tight,
like a burrito.

39:12.060 --> 39:15.105
And we had a good night book.

39:16.106 --> 39:17.232
The one about the bear hunt.

39:18.066 --> 39:22.196
I remember, you know, you'd give me
my white bunny to hug,

39:22.196 --> 39:27.326
and you'd read the book to me,
and you'd do all the voices.

39:27.993 --> 39:29.119
You did everything.

39:32.623 --> 39:34.666
When was the last time you did the voices,
do you think?

39:42.466 --> 39:47.596
I think there were, like, four kids.
Maybe a dog too.

39:48.388 --> 39:53.685
And they decide to go hunt a bear
for whatever reason.

39:54.269 --> 39:57.356
And they head through all this stuff.

39:57.356 --> 39:59.399
Like tall, wavy grass.

39:59.900 --> 40:01.777
The deep, cold river.

40:01.777 --> 40:03.237
Big, dark forest.

40:07.407 --> 40:11.203
"We can't go under it.
We can't go over it.

40:12.538 --> 40:15.207
No. We must go through it."

40:16.708 --> 40:19.086
Must have told it to me every night

40:19.086 --> 40:22.297
for, I don't know,
like two years or something.

40:24.800 --> 40:28.720
Guess it's hard to tell
when you're really little.

40:33.892 --> 40:36.854
Anyway, you know, they get to this cave

40:38.647 --> 40:40.357
and, basically, there's a bear in it.

40:40.357 --> 40:44.444
And they get super freaked
and run all the way home

40:44.444 --> 40:50.325
and decide they're never gonna
hunt a bear ever again.

40:55.289 --> 40:56.331
Thing is...

40:58.625 --> 41:02.462
Dad, I was so fucking scared of that book.

41:03.505 --> 41:06.633
You'd say good night to me,
and I would just lie awake in bed

41:06.633 --> 41:10.929
thinking the shadows on the walls
were bears that were gonna eat me.

41:24.985 --> 41:28.155
I never told you because...

41:30.824 --> 41:35.954
I knew you really, really wanted
to be a good dad.

41:38.332 --> 41:40.209
Even when I was little, I could tell

41:41.084 --> 41:45.297
you just wanted being us to be so awesome.

41:48.967 --> 41:53.263
I thought if I told you
how scared it made me feel,

41:53.263 --> 41:55.432
you would have been sad.

42:03.315 --> 42:04.858
I wish I told you, though.

42:07.361 --> 42:09.821
Could've easily found another book,

42:09.821 --> 42:14.535
like <i>Goodnight Moon</i>
or <i>Give a Moose a Muffin</i>.

42:19.456 --> 42:20.832
I wish I told you.

43:22.269 --> 43:23.896
Wait. Look, there on the right.

43:24.980 --> 43:25.981
Where?

43:26.523 --> 43:29.484
That rock face.
It's gotta be the one, right?

43:29.484 --> 43:30.819
Yeah.

43:30.819 --> 43:32.446
Looks like you found a bigger tree.

43:36.575 --> 43:37.784
You still good to drive?

43:37.784 --> 43:39.077
I'm fine.

43:39.077 --> 43:40.204
You okay?
-I'm okay.

44:02.017 --> 44:04.728
There's about 10,000 fast-food joints

44:04.728 --> 44:06.980
who would pay you in a heartbeat
to work the grill.

44:06.980 --> 44:08.482
Can I have one?

44:09.024 --> 44:10.859
Talking employee of the month.

44:13.487 --> 44:15.739
Maybe a scholarship
to Hamburger University.

44:20.619 --> 44:22.204
So life jackets, huh?

44:22.871 --> 44:23.872
And duct tape.

44:24.540 --> 44:26.208
Can't have too much duct tape.

44:27.668 --> 44:28.836
Using ratchet straps was good,

44:28.836 --> 44:31.964
but the Styrofoam from the life jackets,
that was really smart.

44:33.215 --> 44:35.509
I don't know if I would've
thought of something like that.

44:36.760 --> 44:38.136
You would've done something smarter.

44:38.762 --> 44:41.265
Nothing occurs to me.
Not right off the bat.

44:41.265 --> 44:42.766
What you did was super smart.

44:43.767 --> 44:45.936
And the meds. This was pretty smart too.

44:45.936 --> 44:48.146
All those books,
they must be good for something, right?

44:49.064 --> 44:50.983
Mom helped.
-A little.

44:52.067 --> 44:55.445
So, better get you back studying, right?
While we get to where we're going.

45:03.078 --> 45:04.705
We should pull anchor.

45:07.249 --> 45:08.250
I got it.

45:19.845 --> 45:21.180
You wanna take the wheel?

45:22.514 --> 45:25.058
Are you kidding? You got this.

45:26.435 --> 45:27.895
What about the rapids?

45:27.895 --> 45:29.688
Well, you can't go over them.

45:30.230 --> 45:33.609
Can't go under them.
You're gonna have to go through them.

45:37.237 --> 45:38.280
Here.
