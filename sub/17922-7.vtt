00:26.818 --> 00:27.952
Greetings.

00:27.953 --> 00:30.288
Greetings.

00:30.289 --> 00:32.122
You can park around by the garage.

00:32.124 --> 00:34.291
- Okay, thanks a lot.
- Welcome brother.

00:50.742 --> 00:53.444
Have any of you seen this girl?

00:53.445 --> 00:55.913
Her name is Lindsey. She's my daughter.

01:01.652 --> 01:06.256
Cyndi! Cyndi! Cyndi! Cyndi!

01:15.132 --> 01:18.269
Excuse me. Excuse me, I'm
looking for my daughter.

01:18.270 --> 01:21.338
She's 19. I'm very worried about her.

01:23.674 --> 01:25.108
Flower?

01:26.644 --> 01:28.012
Take it.

01:28.013 --> 01:30.915
Thank God. An actual grownup.

01:30.916 --> 01:32.783
Everyone here is on drugs or something.

01:32.784 --> 01:34.685
Please, can you help me?

01:34.686 --> 01:36.821
My daughter came here five days ago.

01:36.822 --> 01:38.856
I haven't seen or heard from her since.

01:38.857 --> 01:40.358
That's not like her.

01:40.359 --> 01:42.426
I'm so scared something's
happened to her.

01:47.865 --> 01:50.868
What is wrong with all you people?

01:50.869 --> 01:53.237
Mom, I'm over here.

01:53.238 --> 01:55.138
Lindsey.

01:55.940 --> 01:58.475
I was so worried about you.

02:00.011 --> 02:02.947
Hello, Mother. I'm so happy you've come.

02:02.948 --> 02:04.315
You're going to love it here.

02:04.316 --> 02:06.984
- I'm not staying, Lindsey.
- You have to.

02:06.985 --> 02:09.127
You'll miss her if you leave.
She's about to come out.

02:09.128 --> 02:11.489
You're not staying either.
We're going home right now.

02:11.490 --> 02:16.060
No, mother. Cyndi needs me.
I have to be here for her.

02:16.061 --> 02:18.529
What have these people done to you?

02:18.530 --> 02:22.033
They've given me purpose, love.

02:22.034 --> 02:23.701
I'm getting you out of here right now.

02:23.702 --> 02:25.670
You are coming with me.

02:28.273 --> 02:32.375
It's her. Mother, it's her.

02:40.918 --> 02:43.119
Cyndi! Cyndi!

03:06.077 --> 03:07.745
We really need to find wider doors.

03:07.746 --> 03:10.571
Why would the Clippings Book
send us to investigate a cult?

03:10.572 --> 03:14.240
- I'm guessing magical cult.
- There's no ley lines near by.

03:14.241 --> 03:17.543
But there does seem to be trace
levels of magic everywhere.

03:17.544 --> 03:20.113
The Clippings Book said
that some world-renowned chef

03:20.114 --> 03:23.883
gifted his mansion to someone
cult leader only known as "Cyndi."

03:23.884 --> 03:26.578
This doesn't sound like
our kind of investigation.

03:26.579 --> 03:27.654
Not necessarily.

03:27.655 --> 03:29.735
Followers going to a mansion
but they don't come out.

03:29.736 --> 03:31.115
That could be paranormal activity.

03:31.116 --> 03:33.359
- What do we know about this Cyndi?
- Not much.

03:33.360 --> 03:35.463
I read about her in the
"National Inquisitor" online.

03:35.464 --> 03:36.396
It's really mysterious.

03:36.397 --> 03:37.700
She only goes by her first name,

03:37.701 --> 03:39.365
there are no known photos of her

03:39.366 --> 03:40.789
and all kinds of people follow her,

03:40.790 --> 03:42.335
young, old, celebrities.

03:42.336 --> 03:44.637
- You read the "Inquisitor"?
- Every day.

03:44.638 --> 03:48.374
Library has the complete collection of
lost classics of all human civilization.

03:48.375 --> 03:50.543
Panoply of literature and
you read the "Inquisitor."

03:50.544 --> 03:52.578
- What's a panoply?
- You know what a panoply is.

03:52.579 --> 03:55.325
- Librarians, focus, focus.
- Quite right.

03:55.326 --> 03:56.502
There's no time to be lost.

03:56.503 --> 03:58.319
Why is there no time to be lost?

03:58.320 --> 04:00.554
'Cause there never is.

04:00.555 --> 04:02.023
Sorry you missed orientation.

04:02.024 --> 04:03.624
No new applicants until tomorrow.

04:03.625 --> 04:05.493
- Ah.
- Be back at 9:00 AM sharp.

04:05.494 --> 04:06.997
I'm afraid that you don't understand.

04:06.998 --> 04:08.663
You see, we're the Librarians.

04:08.664 --> 04:10.463
What didn't you say so?

04:11.699 --> 04:13.166
Please come join us.

04:17.404 --> 04:19.305
I don't want this. Hey.

04:24.712 --> 04:27.648
That's it? Why does
that always work for you?

04:27.649 --> 04:29.550
It's all in how you say it.

04:29.551 --> 04:30.734
What the hell does that mean?

04:30.735 --> 04:32.486
You know, incantation.

04:32.487 --> 04:33.754
It's a diffusion spell.

04:33.755 --> 04:35.790
Magic? You said we don't use magic.

04:35.791 --> 04:38.224
Yeah, well, it's like
a little white magic.

04:47.835 --> 04:49.570
Excuse me, Miss.

04:49.571 --> 04:51.706
Could you just take a selfie of me

04:51.707 --> 04:54.141
with Cyndiland in the background?

04:54.142 --> 04:56.644
It's not a selfie when
somebody else takes it.

04:56.645 --> 04:59.780
I love Cyndi. I am her biggest fan.

04:59.781 --> 05:03.851
I'm her number one fan. #TeamCyndi.

05:03.852 --> 05:06.052
For the feels!

05:07.621 --> 05:09.657
Take my selfie.

05:09.658 --> 05:11.258
Still not a selfie.

05:11.259 --> 05:14.528
Cyndi, be praised.

05:14.529 --> 05:18.599
It's almost time. I hope I get
picked. I hope I get picked.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.167
Picked for what?

05:20.168 --> 05:24.405
Oh, every day Cyndi allows
a few of her followers

05:24.406 --> 05:26.240
to be in the house with her

05:26.241 --> 05:27.942
for the crew challenge.

05:27.943 --> 05:30.578
Winners are picked to live with her

05:30.579 --> 05:32.713
and work on her staff.

05:32.714 --> 05:36.717
Oh, Cyndi. Cyndi, pick me.

05:36.718 --> 05:39.819
Cyndi, Cyndi!

05:49.030 --> 05:51.030
Cyndi! Cyndi!

05:54.602 --> 05:57.171
Quiet. Jeez.

05:57.172 --> 05:59.507
I was sleeping, for criminy sake.

05:59.508 --> 06:01.308
And now I got a headache, thank you.

06:01.309 --> 06:03.744
But it's time to
choose your houseguests.

06:03.745 --> 06:07.048
Already? Okay.

06:07.049 --> 06:09.949
Um, make room. I'll
walk around and pick.

06:11.952 --> 06:13.086
You.

06:15.623 --> 06:17.224
Okay, so if the Clippings Book sent us,

06:17.225 --> 06:18.893
that means we have to find an artifact.

06:18.894 --> 06:20.895
Chances are it's inside that mansion.

06:20.896 --> 06:22.799
One of us has to figure
out how to get in there.

06:22.800 --> 06:25.132
Problem solved.

06:25.133 --> 06:27.076
You are the most enchanting
woman I've ever seen.

06:27.077 --> 06:28.602
You're like La Grande Odalisque.

06:28.603 --> 06:30.571
- A what?
- I don't know.

06:30.572 --> 06:33.273
I'm gonna like you. You got good words.

06:39.052 --> 06:41.355
What the hell just happened to Flynn?

06:41.356 --> 06:42.956
He was bluffing right, that was a bluff?

06:42.980 --> 06:44.191
Of course that was a bluff.

06:44.192 --> 06:45.721
There's something about that Cyndi.

06:45.722 --> 06:47.160
I know her from somewhere.

06:47.161 --> 06:50.263
Sorry, crew selection
is over for the day.

06:50.264 --> 06:52.099
Yes, but there's been a mistake.

06:52.100 --> 06:53.443
If we could just grab our friend.

06:53.444 --> 06:55.941
No one is allowed in
without Cyndi's approval.

06:55.942 --> 06:59.377
I suggest you join the
others at the worship statue.

07:02.415 --> 07:04.750
It's 12:00.

07:04.751 --> 07:06.718
Time for the noonday worship.

07:08.921 --> 07:10.823
Okay, so we've lost Flynn

07:10.824 --> 07:14.093
and we're surrounded by a
bunch of cultist whack jobs.

07:14.094 --> 07:16.295
- Thoughts?
- Hmm-mm. It's not a cult.

07:16.296 --> 07:19.498
Cults have beliefs like the
ancient cult of Dionysus, all right?

07:19.499 --> 07:21.600
They worshiped fertility,
they worshiped art.

07:21.601 --> 07:23.936
These guys have no
beliefs, they have no code.

07:23.937 --> 07:26.439
They just have a fixation on this Cyndi.

07:26.440 --> 07:28.073
I know I know her from somewhere.

07:28.074 --> 07:30.443
She must be working some
sort of magical artifact

07:30.444 --> 07:33.045
anyone exposed to it falls
into a stupefied adoration.

07:33.046 --> 07:35.381
I'm not stupefied. Anyone
else here stupefied?

07:35.382 --> 07:38.417
If it's a charm, it's
something they're exposed to.

07:38.418 --> 07:40.586
But not us, not yet.

07:40.587 --> 07:41.788
What about the worship statue?

07:41.789 --> 07:43.132
Could be the focus of her powers.

07:43.133 --> 07:45.591
Symbolic magic. Imagery of the idol

07:45.592 --> 07:47.560
causes veneration of
the person depicted.

07:47.561 --> 07:49.061
Sounds like our artifact.

07:49.062 --> 07:51.045
Okay, Ezekiel, Stone, you
go check out the statue.

07:51.046 --> 07:52.812
You and I will go find Flynn.

07:53.732 --> 07:55.501
I'm just so excited to be here.

07:55.502 --> 07:57.036
Everyone is so nice and great.

07:57.037 --> 07:59.038
I think I'm making a
really good impression.

07:59.039 --> 08:00.940
The others, they really seem to like me.

08:00.941 --> 08:02.875
It's like for the first
time I have real friends.

08:02.876 --> 08:05.410
They just... it feels so good, you know?

08:09.582 --> 08:11.750
- Are you allergic to pollen?
- What? Nope.

08:11.751 --> 08:13.384
I have an idea.

08:24.230 --> 08:25.997
Put them over there.

08:34.974 --> 08:38.644
Bless me, Cyndi for I
have Cyndied... Cyndied.

08:38.645 --> 08:39.945
I have many things to confess.

08:39.946 --> 08:42.014
I confess, Cyndi, that I love you

08:42.015 --> 08:44.917
- and I confess that I'm unworthy
of your attentions. - Flynn?

08:44.918 --> 08:46.619
Cyndi, I promised to love...

08:46.620 --> 08:48.754
He's inside there in the video.

08:48.755 --> 08:50.623
What the hell is this thing?

08:50.624 --> 08:52.847
I confess that I'm unworthy
of your attentions...

08:52.848 --> 08:54.151
Some kind of confessional booth.

08:54.152 --> 08:55.895
A little truth for your booth?

08:55.896 --> 08:57.719
Here it goes. You're
the most remarkable woman

08:57.720 --> 08:58.983
I've ever met in my life, okay?

08:58.984 --> 09:00.633
All other women are as naught

09:00.634 --> 09:03.569
to your celestial,
transcended magnificence.

09:03.570 --> 09:07.172
Excuse me, can I go next? I'd
like to profess my love for Cyndi.

09:07.173 --> 09:09.241
- One at a time.
- I have to go right now,

09:09.242 --> 09:12.945
but I have been given the
honor of exfoliating your feet,

09:12.946 --> 09:16.482
so I will see you and
serve you soon, my queen.

09:16.483 --> 09:21.819
You may enter. Our glorious
Cyndi awaits your adoration.

09:35.968 --> 09:39.204
- Agnes.
- I'm working as hard as I can.

09:39.205 --> 09:40.439
Work flipping harder.

09:40.440 --> 09:42.575
I need more and you promised me.

09:42.576 --> 09:43.975
Do you have the...

09:46.779 --> 09:48.814
Now get back to it, Ms. Slow-Pokey.

09:48.815 --> 09:52.717
Now look what you did.
You're making me curse.

09:54.753 --> 09:58.924
C-Y-N-D-I.

09:58.925 --> 10:00.588
If the statue's a magical artifact,

10:00.589 --> 10:03.256
the readings should get
stronger as we get closer.

10:04.830 --> 10:09.368
For you, we would die.

10:09.369 --> 10:12.004
- This could get irritating.
- Could get irritating?

10:12.005 --> 10:13.572
For you, we would die.

10:13.573 --> 10:15.374
All right, you have to have a talisman

10:15.375 --> 10:17.610
to focus emotional energies.

10:17.611 --> 10:21.212
It's driving me crazy.
I know I know that face.

10:23.482 --> 10:27.620
Let's see that. It's getting nothing.

10:27.621 --> 10:29.054
The statue is tacky,

10:29.055 --> 10:31.022
but it's definitely not magical.

10:35.494 --> 10:37.730
What's going on over there?

10:37.731 --> 10:40.231
What's Cyndi doing in a military truck?

10:41.300 --> 10:42.500
Hey...

10:52.277 --> 10:54.178
- Go.
- Relax.

11:06.892 --> 11:10.361
- What the hell, man?
- DOSA works for Cyndi now?

11:17.271 --> 11:19.112
I'm just so excited to be here.

11:19.113 --> 11:20.914
Everyone's so nice...

11:20.915 --> 11:21.914
...and great.

11:23.684 --> 11:26.687
- What now?
- Excuse me, Miss Cyndi,

11:26.688 --> 11:29.823
I need to know if you
have another vial ready.

11:29.824 --> 11:32.559
I am working on it, and
this would be a lot easier

11:32.560 --> 11:35.628
without this cocky doody interruptions.

11:43.704 --> 11:45.425
I think I'm making a
really good impression.

11:45.426 --> 11:46.993
The others they really seem to like me.

11:46.994 --> 11:50.477
It's like, for the first
time I have real friends.

11:50.478 --> 11:54.380
It's just... I feel so good, you know.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.383
Never again.

11:58.986 --> 12:00.954
Never again.

12:10.197 --> 12:11.467
I told you...

12:11.468 --> 12:13.212
Two male intruders broke into the barn.

12:13.213 --> 12:14.268
They broke into the barn?

12:14.269 --> 12:16.203
That is a double no-no.

12:16.204 --> 12:17.770
Bring them to me.

12:25.245 --> 12:28.982
- Flynn! Flynn!
- Flynn! Flynn!

12:28.983 --> 12:31.351
I thought he wasn't gonna
take off on his own anymore.

12:31.352 --> 12:33.420
He's always been wily.

12:33.421 --> 12:38.158
Mon Dieu, I have lost my soul.

12:38.159 --> 12:39.625
My every desire.

12:40.894 --> 12:43.830
I have nothing left. Nothing.

12:43.831 --> 12:47.167
Oh my Gosh, are you...
Oh my Gosh, you are.

12:47.168 --> 12:50.971
Chef Pierre, two Michelin Star chef.

12:50.972 --> 12:53.607
Molecular gastronomy expert,

12:53.608 --> 12:56.043
you vaporized marshmallows.

12:56.044 --> 12:58.378
He's basically a food physicist.

12:58.379 --> 12:59.913
That explains Frankenstein's lab.

12:59.914 --> 13:01.415
Are you the owner of the house?

13:01.416 --> 13:04.818
No, Mademoiselle Cyndi is
the owner of this house.

13:04.819 --> 13:09.456
I gave it to her as a sign of
my complete and utter devotion.

13:09.457 --> 13:12.059
I want nothing more for her

13:12.060 --> 13:15.162
than to delight her palate.

13:15.163 --> 13:17.965
But now, she says she's tired

13:17.966 --> 13:19.466
of my foie gras spheres,

13:19.467 --> 13:22.235
my prawns with Kataifi foam.

13:22.236 --> 13:25.973
And says she wants this.

13:25.974 --> 13:28.075
- Mac and cheese?
- From a box.

13:28.076 --> 13:30.277
I didn't believe such
a travesty existed.

13:30.278 --> 13:32.279
- I like mac and cheese.
- I like it too.

13:32.280 --> 13:34.982
Powdered cheese!

13:34.983 --> 13:38.685
Sacre bleu!

13:38.686 --> 13:42.122
So, Cyndi met him in his restaurant

13:42.123 --> 13:44.191
which means he never
saw the statue of her.

13:44.192 --> 13:46.994
He saw her.

13:46.995 --> 13:48.629
The artifact has to be somewhere on her.

13:48.630 --> 13:52.733
Like an amulet or a charm,
a talisman of some sort.

13:56.937 --> 13:59.573
Two male intruders captured at the barn.

13:59.574 --> 14:02.676
Two males intruders captured
at the barn. Copy that.

14:02.677 --> 14:04.678
Send me the surveillance footage ASAP.

14:04.679 --> 14:06.113
I'm on my way.

14:06.114 --> 14:07.446
All right. All right.

14:11.852 --> 14:14.454
How did these DOSA guys
get mixed up with Cyndi?

14:14.455 --> 14:17.491
Well, they've been
investigating magic just like us.

14:17.492 --> 14:19.026
Probably fell under her spell.

14:19.027 --> 14:20.394
All right, we gotta stay strong.

14:20.395 --> 14:22.262
Resist whatever magic she throws at us.

14:22.263 --> 14:24.364
Resist her magic. Check.

14:24.365 --> 14:26.133
No, pretty sure DOSA

14:26.134 --> 14:29.336
has training in military
and magical counter ops.

14:29.337 --> 14:31.204
Okay, if these guys can
fall under her spell,

14:31.205 --> 14:32.766
a little beta personality like yours...

14:32.767 --> 14:34.408
you're not gonna be
able to take the load.

14:34.409 --> 14:35.782
- Hey, I'm not...
- Stay strong.

14:39.179 --> 14:41.982
- Morning glory.
- Stay strong.

14:41.983 --> 14:43.682
You my sunflower?

14:48.055 --> 14:50.456
I'm whatever you want me to be, darling.

14:51.591 --> 14:52.691
What?

14:54.628 --> 14:57.431
- You are transcendent.
- I give you this.

14:57.432 --> 15:00.100
You're cuter than the usual
poopie heads that try to break in.

15:00.101 --> 15:02.668
Oh, no.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.640
I would never cause you any trouble.

15:06.641 --> 15:09.543
Until this moment, I
was living in the dark.

15:09.544 --> 15:12.578
But now, with you, you're
the light of my world.

15:17.317 --> 15:20.587
Okey dokey, you can stay.

15:20.588 --> 15:22.556
What about you?

15:22.557 --> 15:27.160
Hi. Uh, Ezekiel Jones. Pleasure.

15:27.161 --> 15:30.097
You aren't sweet on me.

15:30.098 --> 15:32.132
Yes. I am.

15:32.133 --> 15:33.636
By the way, you look really familiar.

15:33.637 --> 15:35.502
Where do I know you from?

15:35.503 --> 15:38.739
Don't let him fool you.
My love knows no bounds.

15:38.740 --> 15:41.141
Cyndi, how I love thee.

15:41.142 --> 15:46.079
When eyes laid first on
you, my heart fluttered so.

15:46.080 --> 15:49.316
Goody, another poet.

15:49.317 --> 15:51.384
Stone, this is getting embarrassing.

15:51.385 --> 15:53.186
You really aren't affected, are you?

15:53.187 --> 15:56.590
- By what?
- By me.

15:56.591 --> 15:58.324
Yes, I am. I...

15:59.659 --> 16:03.330
You're cool. You're a cool person.

16:03.331 --> 16:05.799
If that so, then how come
you're being such sneaky snake

16:05.800 --> 16:07.768
and tried to break into the barn?

16:07.769 --> 16:09.803
'Cause they're Librarians.

16:09.804 --> 16:12.839
Adamski, you're supposed to be
overseeing Project Aphrodite.

16:12.840 --> 16:14.223
When I saw the surveillance video,

16:14.224 --> 16:15.675
I recognized them right away

16:15.676 --> 16:18.411
and I came to warn
you they're Librarians.

16:18.412 --> 16:21.014
DOSA's been after the Library for years.

16:21.015 --> 16:22.348
Put that away.

16:23.617 --> 16:25.560
- What's the Library?
- I'll tell you what it is.

16:25.561 --> 16:27.888
It's secret collection
of magical artifacts.

16:27.889 --> 16:29.456
Stone, are you insane? Zip it!

16:29.457 --> 16:31.480
By the way, we came here
because we heard his place

16:31.481 --> 16:33.360
was under control of some kind of magic.

16:33.361 --> 16:36.563
Shut up. Otnay in fron-tay of OSA-DAY!

16:36.564 --> 16:38.565
No, don't shut up. Keep yapping.

16:38.566 --> 16:41.533
Magical artifacts? A secret collection?

16:42.936 --> 16:44.937
This all sounds very interesting.

16:47.031 --> 16:49.701
We're Librarians. We
work for the Library.

16:49.702 --> 16:51.769
No, we're not. We're plumbers.

16:51.770 --> 16:53.753
Yeah. We keep magic from
getting out to the world.

16:53.754 --> 16:56.241
It can be a very dangerous
thing in the wrong hands.

16:56.242 --> 16:58.610
Of course, I would never
keep it from you, my angel.

16:58.611 --> 17:00.712
There's nothing wrong with your hands.

17:00.713 --> 17:03.147
There's something wrong with your mouth.

17:03.148 --> 17:04.582
Where is this place,

17:04.583 --> 17:05.883
this Library?

17:05.884 --> 17:09.654
Oh, it's underneath the
spectacular bridge...

17:09.655 --> 17:12.156
He's nuts. There's no
such thing as the Library.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.291
Yes, there is, Cyndi.

17:14.292 --> 17:15.593
And it is filled

17:15.594 --> 17:18.762
with dangerous magical artifacts.

17:18.763 --> 17:20.665
I hate you so much, DOSA dude.

17:20.665 --> 17:23.201
Your lunch, Cyndi.

17:23.202 --> 17:25.223
Mac and cheese.

17:25.364 --> 17:27.704
Did I say you could
come in, Miss Manners?

17:27.705 --> 17:30.241
This woman is not kitchen staff.

17:30.242 --> 17:33.044
Colonel Eve Baird, she's
with the Library too.

17:33.045 --> 17:35.513
Fine, we'll skip the appetizer.

17:35.514 --> 17:36.914
- Ah!
- Cyndi!

17:36.915 --> 17:39.050
Where are you going,
my blossoming sunflower?

17:39.051 --> 17:40.451
I know where Cyndi went.

17:40.452 --> 17:42.352
Follow me, she's waiting for you.

17:45.490 --> 17:47.158
I called Jenkins for a Magic Door.

17:47.159 --> 17:48.359
This way.

17:48.360 --> 17:50.761
Yeah, blossoming
sunflower right this way.

17:54.599 --> 17:56.834
Don't let the Librarians
leave the property.

17:56.835 --> 17:58.936
- Flynn!
- I can't talk now.

17:58.937 --> 18:01.360
- I have to attend Cyndi's bunions.
- What? Ew, no, that's...

18:01.361 --> 18:02.774
Unhand me, I must be with my love.

18:02.775 --> 18:04.942
Oh, I could really use a door right now.

18:04.943 --> 18:07.784
- We...
- Cyndi's right here. She's right here.

18:07.785 --> 18:09.501
Right through this door.
Right here, just right here.

18:09.502 --> 18:10.481
I don't believe you.

18:10.482 --> 18:13.384
Fine, you two stay here. She
likes Ezekiel better anyway.

18:13.385 --> 18:15.786
- Hell, no.
- No.

18:23.294 --> 18:25.863
Untie me at once! I have
to get back to my lover.

18:25.864 --> 18:27.567
I have to get back to
the light of my life.

18:27.568 --> 18:29.133
Light of your life?

18:29.134 --> 18:30.702
It's like they've been dipped in magic.

18:32.638 --> 18:35.707
- Cold and it's windy and from afar...
- I long for you,

18:35.708 --> 18:38.142
and you're the long
lost love of my life.

18:40.179 --> 18:42.313
How awesomely pathetic.

18:42.314 --> 18:43.815
C-Y-N-D-I!

18:43.816 --> 18:45.316
You're supposed to be this big deal,

18:45.317 --> 18:46.484
super secret G.I. Joe.

18:46.485 --> 18:48.019
How could you let them escape?

18:48.020 --> 18:50.788
I'm sorry. My men had
the Librarians cornered.

18:50.789 --> 18:52.757
I have no idea how they vanished.

18:52.758 --> 18:55.193
Because they use magic. Duh.

18:55.194 --> 18:57.495
And now their magic's
gonna mess with my plans.

18:57.496 --> 19:00.131
If they return I will
handle them, Cyndi.

19:00.132 --> 19:01.350
Anything for you.

19:01.351 --> 19:02.935
What's the deal with Project Aphrodite?

19:02.936 --> 19:04.936
- 48 hours.
- No.

19:04.937 --> 19:07.739
I can't wait that long.
It has to be done tonight.

19:07.740 --> 19:09.807
Tonight? Oh.

19:09.808 --> 19:13.310
I need three canisters worth,
so chop-chop and get cooking.

19:16.981 --> 19:19.050
Jenkins, can you help them?

19:19.051 --> 19:22.053
I certainly hope so. Ezekiel, you
were with Stone the entire time?

19:22.054 --> 19:23.054
Pretty much.

19:23.055 --> 19:24.589
And yet you remained unaffected.

19:24.590 --> 19:27.325
- She's not my type.
- Hmmm...

19:27.326 --> 19:31.461
- Have an idea?
- Yes. No. Well, maybe. Mmm...

19:35.900 --> 19:37.034
These all belong to Cyndi?

19:37.035 --> 19:39.203
Yep. I nicked them from her bedroom.

19:39.204 --> 19:41.539
None of them possess any
magical powers whatsoever.

19:41.540 --> 19:43.441
What's with all the sunflowers?

19:43.442 --> 19:45.109
She's got them everywhere.

19:45.110 --> 19:48.679
Greek mythology, sunflowers
represent unrequited love.

19:48.680 --> 19:50.503
It had to have been
something she did or said,

19:50.504 --> 19:52.183
some sort of rite she performed.

19:52.184 --> 19:55.686
Nope, Cyndi walks in and
Stone turns into a lovebird.

19:57.022 --> 19:59.323
I smell lily of the valley.

19:59.324 --> 20:00.725
- It's weird.
- I second that.

20:00.726 --> 20:04.395
Stone and Flynn smelled
oddly flowery too.

20:04.396 --> 20:06.264
It's her perfume.

20:06.265 --> 20:07.768
So we're not looking for an artifact.

20:07.769 --> 20:10.069
We are looking for a love potion.

20:11.068 --> 20:13.204
Now, the first thing
that one should know

20:13.205 --> 20:17.175
about love potions is that they
were never about instilling love.

20:17.176 --> 20:19.677
If there's no love in a love
potion, then what's in it?

20:19.678 --> 20:24.015
Obsessionem. Latin for "obsession."

20:24.016 --> 20:27.285
Ancient elixirs such as
these were originally used

20:27.286 --> 20:30.788
to create uncontrollable
arousal and energy

20:30.789 --> 20:32.757
- for the battlefield.
- Well, like a possession

20:32.758 --> 20:34.859
but without a spirit
actually taking over the body.

20:34.860 --> 20:36.561
Yes, it can be very dangerous.

20:36.562 --> 20:39.063
Kinda like a wild pack of Beliebers?

20:39.064 --> 20:40.498
I have no idea what that means,

20:40.499 --> 20:41.699
but probably worse.

20:41.700 --> 20:43.968
So how did an obsession potion

20:43.969 --> 20:45.336
get to be called a love potion?

20:45.337 --> 20:47.738
Romanic book writers and
greeting card companies

20:47.739 --> 20:50.041
shanghaied the word and redefined it.

20:50.042 --> 20:51.943
Okay, so why didn't the love...

20:51.944 --> 20:54.212
I mean, the obsession potion work on me?

20:54.213 --> 20:56.156
Actually, Mr. Jones, it's rather simple.

20:56.157 --> 20:58.850
Because you're completely
obsessed with yourself.

20:58.851 --> 21:02.186
It didn't work on me
because I'm so awesome.

21:02.187 --> 21:03.920
Advantage me.

21:06.023 --> 21:08.159
Yes, well, whoever
made Cyndi's fragrance

21:08.160 --> 21:10.228
is a very powerful
practitioner of magic.

21:10.229 --> 21:13.064
Well, it's not Cyndi. She can't
even make herself a mac and cheese.

21:13.065 --> 21:14.799
Somebody's gotta be helping her.

21:14.800 --> 21:16.367
- A witch?
- Or a warlock?

21:16.368 --> 21:18.636
Mac and cheese!

21:18.637 --> 21:21.772
Chef Pierre's kitchen is way more
hi-tech than a normal kitchen.

21:21.773 --> 21:23.040
He's a molecular gastronomist.

21:23.041 --> 21:25.109
It's decked out like a science lab.

21:25.110 --> 21:27.111
What, you think the chef is a warlock?

21:27.112 --> 21:29.013
No, he's under the spell too,

21:29.014 --> 21:31.015
but his kitchen is the perfect place

21:31.016 --> 21:32.617
to home brew some love potion.

21:32.618 --> 21:34.218
I can try to make an antidote

21:34.219 --> 21:37.255
from the trace readings I get
from Mr. Carsen and Mr. Stone,

21:37.256 --> 21:39.519
but if you can get me a pure
sample of Cyndi's fragrance,

21:39.520 --> 21:40.791
I can do this in no time.

21:40.792 --> 21:43.461
Fire up the back door,
Jenkins. We're going back.

21:43.462 --> 21:45.463
Not quite yet.

21:47.165 --> 21:48.566
What is that?

21:48.567 --> 21:50.234
A salve that I've created.

21:50.235 --> 21:53.971
It will help block your olfactory
senses from Cyndi's redolence.

21:53.972 --> 21:55.940
Ugh!

21:55.941 --> 21:58.209
You know, it's not so
bad if you don't breathe.

21:58.210 --> 22:00.244
No, Jenkins, I'm immune!

22:00.245 --> 22:02.446
I don't need any of your
funky junk, remember?

22:02.447 --> 22:05.081
Yes, I do remember.

22:09.881 --> 22:12.104
Do you think the
mysterious Project Aphrodite

22:12.105 --> 22:13.491
- is in there?
- Who knows?

22:13.492 --> 22:15.660
Ezekiel, see if you can track
down a sample of the fragrance

22:15.661 --> 22:17.061
so Jenkins can make an antidote.

22:17.062 --> 22:18.922
Cassandra and I are
gonna check out the barn.

22:24.201 --> 22:26.903
Station two, report back
to the command center.

22:34.613 --> 22:36.046
Go.

22:58.235 --> 23:00.037
Project Aphrodite.

23:00.038 --> 23:02.573
What's Cyndi doing with a giant missile?

23:02.574 --> 23:05.376
They're preparing it to launch.

23:05.377 --> 23:07.210
Well, what's the target?

23:09.515 --> 23:11.822
That's an LX-18 short range missile.

23:11.823 --> 23:14.590
DOSA must have brought it for Cyndi.

23:16.460 --> 23:18.328
What is Cyndi doing
with a giant missile?

23:18.329 --> 23:23.233
It could be adapted to carry
a nerve gas payload or...

23:23.234 --> 23:25.369
a love potion.

23:25.370 --> 23:26.470
Only that's crazy.

23:26.471 --> 23:28.637
Cassandra, tell me that's crazy.

23:30.674 --> 23:33.844
Okay, given the 22 degree
angle of the platform

23:33.845 --> 23:35.779
and a launch speed of
2.5 miles per second,

23:35.780 --> 23:39.616
it's on track to reach
40,000 feet and then...

23:39.617 --> 23:43.387
- Oh, boy.
- Do I wanna know?

23:43.388 --> 23:45.355
It's gonna explode in the troposphere.

23:45.356 --> 23:48.091
When it does, the jet
stream will carry it south.

23:48.092 --> 23:49.626
Meaning that within 24 hours...

23:49.627 --> 23:51.361
Everyone along the eastern seaboard

23:51.362 --> 23:53.696
will be exposed to the potion.

24:01.471 --> 24:02.738
Doug.

24:04.274 --> 24:05.708
Thank you, ma'am.

24:07.411 --> 24:08.879
We'll need more for phase two.

24:08.880 --> 24:12.815
Of course I'm making more.
What do you think I'm doing?

24:14.284 --> 24:16.486
I think we found our witch.

24:16.487 --> 24:18.921
That's just crass stereotyping.

24:26.830 --> 24:29.700
Gentlemen, not exactly
a "eureka" moment,

24:29.701 --> 24:31.702
but I think I have found something.

24:31.703 --> 24:35.138
Now, I was able to collect
trace findings of the love potion

24:35.139 --> 24:36.206
from your clothes,

24:36.207 --> 24:38.575
and synthesizing the ingredients,

24:38.576 --> 24:41.845
I do believe that I have
made an antidote. So...

24:41.846 --> 24:43.380
Have you seen my Cyndi?

24:43.381 --> 24:45.484
- I'd love to see her again.
- I should be able to...

24:50.153 --> 24:54.991
Now, if this is correct, it should come
back to normal in three, two, one...

24:57.562 --> 25:00.463
- Jenkins.
- Sir. Good to have you back.

25:01.164 --> 25:02.798
Stone?

25:04.434 --> 25:07.571
I never noticed how
piercing your eyes are.

25:07.572 --> 25:10.374
You're a remarkably attractive man.

25:10.375 --> 25:12.042
With a very gentle smile.

25:12.043 --> 25:13.977
Noble nose. Strong jaw.

25:16.280 --> 25:18.115
Please, forgive me. Sorry, so sorry.

25:18.116 --> 25:22.152
That's all right, I just have
a little more work to do, sorry.

25:35.899 --> 25:37.522
Tell them I'll have
it filled in an hour.

25:37.523 --> 25:39.056
Yes, Miss Cyndi.

25:46.576 --> 25:48.745
These have been the
happiest days of my life.

25:48.746 --> 25:51.681
It's like, for the first
time I'm so connected.

25:51.682 --> 25:55.419
Good people who really care about me.

25:55.420 --> 25:58.955
My whole life, all I've ever
wanted is to be accepted.

25:58.956 --> 26:02.392
And here I found a group
of people that accepted me

26:02.393 --> 26:05.528
and like me and were my friends.

26:10.967 --> 26:12.736
We know all about your missile

26:12.737 --> 26:16.039
and your little potion and
what you and Cyndi are up to.

26:16.040 --> 26:17.240
Oh, thank God.

26:17.241 --> 26:19.609
It's been a nightmare. That wicked girl,

26:19.610 --> 26:21.211
she forced me to do a terrible thing.

26:21.212 --> 26:23.780
Forced? So you're not under her spell?

26:23.781 --> 26:27.217
She has me watched 24 hours a day.

26:27.218 --> 26:29.152
I've practically been her slave.

26:29.153 --> 26:33.390
Look, we can help you but we
need a sample of that love potion.

26:33.391 --> 26:35.258
There's a ton of it in the fridge.

26:35.259 --> 26:39.229
But it won't work without
the secret ingredient.

26:39.230 --> 26:41.631
Wait. Secret ingredient?

26:41.632 --> 26:46.636
Tears. Tears of the
one seeking adoration.

26:46.637 --> 26:48.470
Come... see.

26:52.742 --> 26:55.745
Wow. There's enough in
here for ten missiles.

27:00.317 --> 27:02.319
That witch locked us in.

27:02.320 --> 27:06.056
It's time to vote. One of
you leaves the house today.

27:06.057 --> 27:07.657
Please, lift up your cards

27:07.658 --> 27:10.293
with the name of the
person you're voting out

27:10.294 --> 27:13.029
and the emoji telling us
how you feel about them.

27:13.030 --> 27:14.797
Cindy, let's start with you.

27:16.433 --> 27:19.936
Um... I couldn't pick anyone.

27:19.937 --> 27:22.739
You guys have been so great
and you've been so wonderful,

27:22.740 --> 27:25.609
I didn't... I wouldn't want
any of you to leave the show.

27:25.610 --> 27:27.409
And Dale.

27:27.906 --> 27:30.776
Oh my God. Dale, what?

27:30.777 --> 27:34.518
No! You guys...

27:34.591 --> 27:35.622
Cindy, I'm sorry,

27:35.623 --> 27:37.524
but the house has
unanimously voted you out.

27:37.525 --> 27:39.259
- Please, say your good-byes.
- Freak.

27:39.260 --> 27:41.261
- Loser!
- Get out of the house.

27:41.262 --> 27:43.864
We don't want you here.

27:43.865 --> 27:46.166
I thought... I thought we were friends.

27:46.167 --> 27:50.037
Why would you do that to
someone that was your friend?

27:50.038 --> 27:51.438
I thought that we were friends

27:51.439 --> 27:53.006
and you guys were so nice to me.

27:53.007 --> 27:57.277
And you... I trusted you.
You would give me advice.

27:57.278 --> 27:59.446
You helped me pick out
this shirt for today

27:59.447 --> 28:00.781
and I don't understand.

28:00.782 --> 28:03.483
No, wait, I trusted you.
I just wanna know why!

28:03.484 --> 28:05.685
I wanna know why you
would do that to somebody.

28:05.686 --> 28:07.854
- Why would you...
- That's where I remember you from.

28:07.855 --> 28:09.856
You! I'm calling the guards.

28:09.857 --> 28:12.325
You're Cindy Kroger. "The Life Show."

28:12.326 --> 28:14.594
You changed the spelling
but that's you up there.

28:14.595 --> 28:17.931
Those people were
absolutely horrible to you.

28:17.932 --> 28:20.132
You saw the show?

28:21.701 --> 28:24.004
What they did to me?

28:24.005 --> 28:27.441
I'm not gonna let anybody
make me feel like that.

28:27.442 --> 28:28.675
Ever again.

28:28.676 --> 28:30.544
By using a love potion?

28:30.545 --> 28:31.945
Why not?

28:31.946 --> 28:34.714
After they kicked me
off "The Life Show,"

28:34.715 --> 28:38.251
I didn't wanna live anymore.

28:38.252 --> 28:42.155
And then Agnes, the show's
makeup artist, she came to me

28:42.156 --> 28:45.692
and she said that she
could make me a potion

28:45.693 --> 28:47.494
that would... that would help me,

28:47.495 --> 28:49.563
that would make everybody love me.

28:49.564 --> 28:50.564
It didn't work on me.

28:50.565 --> 28:52.632
It didn't. Why?

28:52.633 --> 28:56.503
Because, I already love, trust,

28:56.504 --> 29:00.272
and believe in someone so
much I could never be swayed.

29:02.242 --> 29:04.811
And that person is me.

29:04.812 --> 29:07.481
It doesn't work on you
'cause you're an egomaniac?

29:07.482 --> 29:09.249
No, I don't need other people

29:09.250 --> 29:11.985
to make me believe in
myself, to validate me.

29:11.986 --> 29:14.488
And you don't, either.

29:14.489 --> 29:15.921
You don't know me.

29:18.024 --> 29:19.592
You don't know how I feel.

29:21.328 --> 29:22.528
How alone I am.

29:27.501 --> 29:30.770
I've been called a weirdo and a freak

29:30.771 --> 29:32.405
for as long as I can remember.

29:32.406 --> 29:36.543
And now with the potion, everything
is good, you're happy now?

29:36.544 --> 29:38.945
I will be. I just need more followers.

29:38.946 --> 29:41.181
I just need more people to love me.

29:41.182 --> 29:44.084
And how many more exactly, 100? 1,000?

29:44.085 --> 29:46.268
How about the entire nation?
How about the whole world?

29:46.269 --> 29:48.155
- Don't mock me.
- I'm not.

29:48.156 --> 29:52.058
In fact, I am just like you.

29:52.059 --> 29:55.128
I grew up dirt poor, we had nothing.

29:55.129 --> 29:56.763
The other kids laughed at me

29:56.764 --> 29:59.431
because of what I
wore and where I lived.

30:01.268 --> 30:06.206
So, I decided one day that if this world
wasn't gonna give me what I wanted,

30:06.207 --> 30:07.440
I would take it.

30:07.441 --> 30:10.377
So I became a thief
and not just any thief.

30:10.378 --> 30:13.879
I became the greatest
thief that ever lived.

30:15.916 --> 30:17.584
And you know what?

30:17.585 --> 30:22.221
No matter how much I stole,
I always needed to steal more.

30:28.995 --> 30:32.732
When you allow a hole in
your heart to grow that big,

30:32.733 --> 30:35.034
it can never be filled.

30:38.471 --> 30:40.373
I just wanna be loved.

30:40.374 --> 30:42.475
That is not love.

30:42.476 --> 30:45.912
That is obsession and
it's only gonna grow worse.

30:45.913 --> 30:50.383
I promise you, Cindy. If you do not
stop now, this will not end well.

30:50.384 --> 30:53.520
No, no. Those people
will do anything for me.

30:53.521 --> 30:55.387
You're wrong. They love me.

30:57.424 --> 30:58.557
Do they?

31:09.603 --> 31:14.441
Cyndi. You look so gorgeous today.

31:14.442 --> 31:16.409
- She's here.
- Cyndi.

31:16.410 --> 31:18.578
- Cyndi.
- Cyndi.

31:18.579 --> 31:20.313
Hi, Cyndi.

31:20.314 --> 31:21.815
That is love.

31:21.816 --> 31:25.685
- Lovely, Cyndi.
- That is obsession.

31:25.686 --> 31:28.788
Look at what it becomes.

31:43.670 --> 31:47.707
Hey, who's that with my Cyndi?

31:47.708 --> 31:52.178
She's not your Cyndi. She's mine.

31:52.179 --> 31:56.983
Mine, she's mine.

31:56.984 --> 31:59.885
She's my Cyndi. She's
mine. She's my Cyndi.

32:01.988 --> 32:04.958
- Stop it.
- She's mine.

32:04.959 --> 32:07.761
- Stop. Stop.
- She's mine.

32:07.762 --> 32:10.664
Stop it. No. No, stop it.

32:10.665 --> 32:12.632
Stop it! No, stop it!

32:12.633 --> 32:14.134
No!

32:19.573 --> 32:21.207
Oh, no! You're hurting me!

32:21.208 --> 32:23.576
Cindy, come here. Everyone, get away.

32:23.577 --> 32:25.644
- Get away from her!
- She's mine.

32:27.747 --> 32:29.281
Cyndi, no, get away from her.

32:33.553 --> 32:34.788
Cyndi!

32:34.789 --> 32:37.322
- We love you!
- Cyndi, open up!

32:38.458 --> 32:41.261
That is your future, Cindy.

32:41.262 --> 32:43.229
I don't understand,
they're supposed to love me.

32:43.230 --> 32:45.932
That's not you. None of it is.

32:45.933 --> 32:47.834
Look, I watched you on that show.

32:47.835 --> 32:51.705
You are a really sweet,
kind, and caring person.

32:51.706 --> 32:55.141
Kinda weird but that's
what made you cool.

32:55.142 --> 32:57.376
Now look at what you've become.

33:00.647 --> 33:04.250
This isn't I wanted.

33:04.251 --> 33:06.152
Magic corrupts.

33:06.153 --> 33:08.854
It does this to people,
it's not your fault.

33:12.726 --> 33:16.930
No... no. I am so sorry.

33:16.931 --> 33:18.897
I was such a fool. I...

33:20.567 --> 33:22.202
I have to stop the missile launch.

33:22.203 --> 33:24.537
Great.

33:24.538 --> 33:25.972
Wait, missile launch?

33:25.973 --> 33:27.640
Come on, come on, come on.

33:27.641 --> 33:31.610
Ah. Okay. Okay.

33:34.381 --> 33:37.250
When I give the word, kick right there.

33:37.251 --> 33:38.885
Okay. Are you sure this will work?

33:38.886 --> 33:42.889
Well, the door's latched
from the inside, so...

33:42.890 --> 33:45.392
if we can lower the
temperature of the room

33:45.393 --> 33:47.694
below the ductile-brittle
transition temperature,

33:47.695 --> 33:51.331
the weakest bonds of
the metal crystal lattice

33:51.332 --> 33:54.868
should become sus...
susceptible to damage and break.

33:54.869 --> 33:56.636
Yeah. If we don't freeze first.

33:56.637 --> 33:58.905
There is that. So...

33:58.906 --> 34:01.474
Okay, we're almost there.

34:01.475 --> 34:04.042
Okay, go. Now.

34:06.146 --> 34:07.180
Oh, you did it.

34:07.181 --> 34:10.083
I've an idea. Grab an onion.

34:10.083 --> 34:11.317
- Red or white?
- White.

34:11.318 --> 34:12.618
White.

34:25.565 --> 34:26.966
Everyone, listen to me.

34:26.967 --> 34:29.067
We have to stop the launch.

34:31.404 --> 34:32.638
Guys, I said stop.

34:34.808 --> 34:39.411
- Hey, hey, I'm serious.
- So are they.

34:39.413 --> 34:43.149
I anticipated that you
may have a change of heart.

34:43.150 --> 34:48.053
So now, they have a new love... me!

34:49.155 --> 34:50.989
System activated.

35:12.695 --> 35:15.197
Isn't this what you
always wanted, Cindy?

35:15.198 --> 35:18.200
The missile will launch and
the whole world will love you.

35:18.201 --> 35:19.901
Incoming...

35:26.142 --> 35:28.944
Is that the best you can do, Guardian?

35:28.945 --> 35:31.847
The potion won't work without tears.

35:31.848 --> 35:34.182
- On it.
- Ah.

35:38.387 --> 35:39.521
Onion. Oh.

35:57.840 --> 35:59.140
I love you, Agnes.

36:01.410 --> 36:02.978
Be mine forever.

36:02.979 --> 36:05.346
- Only mine.
- She's mine.

36:11.220 --> 36:13.154
Mine and only mine.

36:16.158 --> 36:17.426
Eeny, meeny, miny...

36:17.427 --> 36:18.793
Moe!

36:23.999 --> 36:26.502
If all my years in
counter-terrorism taught me anything,

36:26.503 --> 36:29.504
it's never press the red button.

36:31.240 --> 36:35.377
Um, guys, the overdose of the potion
has made them completely obsessed.

36:35.378 --> 36:36.811
They're gonna tear her apart.

36:50.493 --> 36:52.761
The antidote.

36:57.333 --> 36:59.201
I think so, anyway.

36:59.202 --> 37:01.469
It worked on Mr. Carsen and Mr. Stone.

37:02.571 --> 37:03.938
- Ah.
- Whoa.

37:05.207 --> 37:08.577
Wait a minute. How did
she know I'm a guardian?

37:08.578 --> 37:10.778
Ah!

37:13.916 --> 37:15.351
Apep!

37:15.352 --> 37:16.818
What the hell is an "Apep"?

37:17.953 --> 37:19.922
Monster, Egyptian god of chaos.

37:19.923 --> 37:22.824
Really bad dude trying to
release pure evil into the world.

37:30.699 --> 37:32.167
I kinda miss Pierre.

37:32.168 --> 37:35.436
His chili mac and cheese
dogs were so yummy.

37:37.132 --> 37:39.595
Yeah, at least he let you stay
in the mansion a few more weeks

37:39.596 --> 37:43.264
while he goes to save the
restaurant he's been neglecting.

37:45.948 --> 37:48.417
I wanna thank you, Ezekiel.

37:48.418 --> 37:52.253
You made me appreciate that
it's okay to be just me.

37:53.522 --> 37:54.990
That's what I do.

37:54.991 --> 37:57.026
You said that we were alike,

37:57.027 --> 38:01.096
so how did you finally
fix the hole in your heart?

38:01.097 --> 38:03.832
The one that made you
want to keep stealing?

38:03.833 --> 38:06.435
It's not about who

38:06.436 --> 38:09.971
or how many people love you.

38:11.407 --> 38:14.243
It's about who you love.

38:14.244 --> 38:17.178
I finally found the
right ones worthy of mine.

38:18.781 --> 38:21.350
Did you think I'll ever
find friends like yours?

38:21.351 --> 38:23.418
Well, you got one friend.

38:24.853 --> 38:26.320
Take it from there.

38:35.464 --> 38:36.864
Wow.

38:38.467 --> 38:40.336
I gotta... Library... go.

38:40.337 --> 38:43.104
To... you... Jenkins.

38:44.206 --> 38:45.306
I should probably go.

38:51.680 --> 38:53.214
I'll see you around.

39:02.626 --> 39:05.661
Cyndi, I'm coming! Cyndi!

39:05.662 --> 39:08.430
- You stay away from her.
- Stop saying her name.

39:09.699 --> 39:11.332
You think it's funny? Ha, ha.

39:12.968 --> 39:15.404
Yes, indeed. Now, are we certain

39:15.405 --> 39:17.973
that this smoke we saw was Apep?

39:17.974 --> 39:19.742
Exactly the same as always.

39:19.743 --> 39:21.443
And Agnes had no memory of anything

39:21.444 --> 39:22.711
afterward whatsoever.

39:22.712 --> 39:24.055
I mean, if he's the god of chaos,

39:24.056 --> 39:25.414
why would he want to spread love?

39:25.415 --> 39:28.150
Not love, obsession.

39:28.151 --> 39:31.620
And the entire world being obsessed

39:31.621 --> 39:33.656
with one single person?

39:33.657 --> 39:34.923
That would wreak chaos.

39:34.924 --> 39:36.707
The balance of good and
evil would be tipped.

39:36.708 --> 39:38.927
And now we know why the
Clipping Book sent us.

39:38.928 --> 39:40.562
And I believe that should be stored

39:40.563 --> 39:42.731
in the new wing for modern artifacts.

39:42.732 --> 39:44.833
Exactly where I was about to take it.

39:44.834 --> 39:46.935
- Ah. May I?
- Of course.

39:46.936 --> 39:49.571
The start of a new love potion wing.

39:49.572 --> 39:51.774
So do we know where Apep is now?

39:51.775 --> 39:54.143
Well, my guess he went
back to his sarcophagus.

39:54.144 --> 39:56.527
He has to regenerate and that's
the only place he can do it.

39:56.528 --> 39:58.347
And the sarcophagus
has disappeared, so...

39:58.348 --> 39:59.948
Well, we need to find it.

39:59.949 --> 40:01.950
Should we see if Cindy wants to help?

40:01.951 --> 40:03.651
Wow, I'm never gonna
live this down, am I?

40:03.652 --> 40:04.589
Never.

40:06.588 --> 40:09.524
So, Jones...

40:10.826 --> 40:12.127
You realize your narcissism

40:12.128 --> 40:13.662
isn't the reason why that love potion

40:13.663 --> 40:16.598
didn't work on you, right?

40:16.599 --> 40:18.867
What are you talking about?

40:18.868 --> 40:23.739
Well, Flynn and I have
pretty healthy egos too.

40:23.740 --> 40:27.942
Love potion worked on
us. It didn't on you.

40:30.212 --> 40:31.445
Why is that?

40:32.681 --> 40:34.416
'Cause you already had feelings for her?

40:34.417 --> 40:36.185
Cindy? Are you insane?

40:36.186 --> 40:39.455
Ever since you saw that
girl on that TV show,

40:39.456 --> 40:40.956
you had a thing for her.

40:40.957 --> 40:42.580
That's why the potion
didn't work on you.

40:42.581 --> 40:44.848
You were already in love with her.

41:01.710 --> 41:03.544
Love potion.
