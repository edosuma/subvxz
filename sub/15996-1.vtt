04:19.583 --> 04:22.710
<i>There is a dirty protest, the Blanket Protest,
which has been going on for years,<i></i></i>

04:22.796 --> 04:26.015
<i>all in support of the same demand: 
political status.<i></i></i>

04:26.101 --> 04:30.435
<i>That is to say, different treatment 
for people who commit crimes,<i></i></i>

04:30.521 --> 04:31.626
<i>hideous crimes,<i></i></i>

04:31.712 --> 04:33.886
<i>for what the claim to be a political motive <i></i></i>

04:33.972 --> 04:36.867
<i>and that is what the Government will not grant.</i>

05:22.074 --> 05:24.411
So Daniel he here's a noise 
coming from his Granny's room,

05:24.902 --> 05:26.804
he runs up to his Granny's room, 
he opens the door

05:26.805 --> 05:29.081
and there'a a waifer 
having a go with his Granny.

05:29.082 --> 05:32.663
The naughty fellow turns around and says:
"See, it's not so fucking funny with a German one."

08:41.501 --> 08:47.520
<i>There is no such thing as political murder,
political bombing or political violence.</i>

08:47.606 --> 08:53.056
<i>There is only criminal murder,
criminal bombing and criminal violence.</i>

08:53.557 --> 09:01.190
<i>We will not compromise on this.
There will be no political status.</i>

09:31.501 --> 09:34.517
I will not wear the uniform of a criminal.

09:34.603 --> 09:37.686
I demand to wear me own clothes.

09:38.541 --> 09:52.742
<i>Non-conforming prisoner, 08-12-1980</i>

14:01.338 --> 14:02.580
What?

14:07.662 --> 14:10.369
What's it you say your name is again?

14:11.391 --> 14:13.017
- Gilan.
- Gilan. 

14:13.263 --> 14:14.550
Aye. 

14:15.625 --> 14:17.967
Fancy Quinn.

14:19.364 --> 14:22.767
Falls Road. Fancy Quinn.
Do you know him?

14:24.420 --> 14:26.911
- No.
- No?

14:31.350 --> 14:33.592
How long did you get?

14:33.877 --> 14:36.136
Twelve years.

14:38.306 --> 14:40.860
And you?

14:44.396 --> 14:48.617
- Six years. Six.
- Six?

14:48.703 --> 14:51.305
Aye.

14:52.813 --> 14:55.736
You lucky bastard.

22:04.507 --> 22:09.087
<i>... the political adviser of Merlin Reese,
when he was at the Home Office with Roger Darlington.</i>

22:09.173 --> 22:14.298
<i>He rejects the official position on phone taps, 
saying that there has been only a modest overall increase,</i>

22:14.488 --> 22:17.788
<i>and says that Parliament has no way 
of knowing how much tapping goes on,</i>

22:17.796 --> 22:23.939
<i>because the Prime Minister and other senior Ministers 
don't even have to get warrants to get a tap put into effect.</i>

25:04.937 --> 25:05.892
What?

25:07.333 --> 25:09.185
Get ready.

29:49.478 --> 29:53.521
- Are you all right, Bobby?
- I'm grand, Ma.

29:54.339 --> 29:59.566
- Are they giving you treatment for that?
- It's been looked after.

30:02.107 --> 30:04.212
And the young fellow?

30:04.759 --> 30:07.859
He's a handful, I tell you that.

30:08.774 --> 30:11.507
- Are you eating all right?
- I'm grand, Ma.

30:11.593 --> 30:15.939
- Are they feeding you all right?
- Don't you two be worrying about me.

30:17.944 --> 30:20.084
Five minutes.

30:20.596 --> 30:23.104
Five minutes.

30:24.542 --> 30:27.033
- You eating all right?
- Aye.

30:27.119 --> 30:30.598
- It tastes like shit, doesn't it?
- You get used to it.

30:35.178 --> 30:37.544
You're looking well.

30:38.901 --> 30:43.048
So are you, son. So are you.

30:58.213 --> 31:01.752
The righteous cry out.
And the Lord hears them.

31:01.838 --> 31:04.849
He delivers them from all their troubles.

31:04.935 --> 31:10.901
The Lord is close to the brokenhearted 
and saves those who are Christians first.

31:10.987 --> 31:16.411
The righteous man has many troubles,
but the Lord delivers him from them all.

31:16.497 --> 31:21.447
He protects all his bones
and not one of them will be broken.

31:23.907 --> 31:29.885
Evil will slay the wicked 
and the foes of the righteous will be condemned.

31:29.971 --> 31:32.648
The Lord redeems his servants.

31:32.734 --> 31:37.080
No one will be condemned,
who finds refuge in Him.

31:43.661 --> 31:45.919
Let us pray.

35:36.071 --> 35:39.870
- Damn dirty bastards!
- Fucking dirty bastards!

36:01.019 --> 36:04.822
I- I- I. R. A. I- I- I. R. A.

36:04.908 --> 36:10.352
- I- I- I. R. A. I- I- I. R. A.
- Fucking bastards!

36:57.371 --> 37:01.152
- Everything in order?
- Yes, sir, in order, sir.

37:01.238 --> 37:03.417
Very good.

38:48.785 --> 38:51.902
John! John!

39:15.975 --> 39:20.387
Get the fuck off me!

39:25.721 --> 39:27.864
See that? See that?

39:27.950 --> 39:30.547
Get the fuck off me!

39:31.989 --> 39:36.546
What are you doing to him?

39:37.855 --> 39:41.490
Get the fuck off me, you damn!

42:17.354 --> 42:19.525
Hi Mom.

42:30.995 --> 42:34.050
Why are you doing sitting in here?

43:00.863 --> 43:02.026
Daisies.

43:53.776 --> 43:55.481
You can sit down any time you like.

43:55.567 --> 43:58.614
Priest etiquette.
Never sit before you're asked.

43:58.700 --> 44:00.629
Sit down, Don.

44:00.715 --> 44:05.004
- Don't look them over till you're eager.
- Best to hover at the door.

44:05.221 --> 44:08.622
You learned that your first week at the seminary, boy.

44:13.527 --> 44:16.354
- Cig?
- Come on.

44:19.902 --> 44:24.348
Bit of a break from smoking the Bible, eh?

44:27.039 --> 44:29.473
Work out which pick is the best smoke?

44:29.559 --> 44:34.695
We only smoke the Lamentations. 
Just right for a cigarette.

44:34.781 --> 44:38.703
Nice room.  Very clean.

44:38.789 --> 44:41.283
- Where is it you're from again, Don?
- Born, you mean?

44:41.369 --> 44:43.200
Ballygobackwards.

44:43.286 --> 44:46.078
- Oh, the city dog.
- Ballyroberts.

44:46.164 --> 44:49.912
We play south of Ballymonie: Kilrea.

44:50.793 --> 44:55.545
- I remember a homily you did in March sometime.
- Will you listen to it?

44:55.631 --> 44:58.484
- I'm sure the men hold you in high esteem.
- I can feel a dig coming on.

44:58.570 --> 45:00.722
- You're very quick.
- Right.

45:00.829 --> 45:03.434
No, you're respected, you know that.

45:03.751 --> 45:05.842
I like those stories you tell about the countryside.

45:05.928 --> 45:09.822
A child held for poaching, robbing apples, 
stampeding cattle...

45:09.908 --> 45:13.576
- Fine education for a priest.
- A priest working in West Belfast? It is, aye.

45:13.662 --> 45:15.370
Stampeding comes in handy down in the Falls Road, eh?

45:15.456 --> 45:17.081
The RUC hate me.
(Royal Ulster Police, Protestant police.)

45:17.167 --> 45:18.828
- You miss it though?
- What?

45:18.914 --> 45:20.218
The countryside.

45:20.304 --> 45:22.770
I sort of get home 
and see my wee brother every month or so...

45:22.856 --> 45:27.028
but I miss the usual clean air... 
space, all that.

45:27.114 --> 45:31.472
- It feels closer to who you are.
- That it is, no question.

45:32.933 --> 45:35.500
Something like a fish out of water 
working in a big city like Belfast...

45:35.586 --> 45:38.500
but it's a job, isn't it?

45:38.671 --> 45:41.294
You stop looking around at your surroundings 
quick enough when you figure

45:41.380 --> 45:44.770
that your business is the business 
of the soul and all.

45:44.856 --> 45:46.915
- Business of the soul?
- Aye. You know what I mean.

45:47.001 --> 45:51.007
- I'm going down the same way too?
- Aye, and you can use that for your charge.

45:51.093 --> 45:53.150
Go on.

45:53.236 --> 45:55.852
Well, I suppose what I'm saying is...

45:55.938 --> 45:59.811
you get on.
Kilrea can wait until I'm an old man.

45:59.897 --> 46:03.174
- Too many scavengers will be saved in Belfast anyway.
- Busy work, aye.

46:03.260 --> 46:05.849
- Should God award you in heaven?
- Aye, and I'll be thankful.

46:05.935 --> 46:09.138
Once there's wine involved.

46:10.532 --> 46:13.459
So what does your wee brother do back home?

46:15.256 --> 46:17.507
He is parish priest.

46:19.400 --> 46:22.017
He's a sneaky wee bastard.
You know the sort, Bobby.

46:22.103 --> 46:24.812
- Still goes poaching.
- Poaching jobs.

46:24.898 --> 46:28.995
- And he's younger than me by 8 years all right.
- Go on.

46:29.748 --> 46:34.580
As a clergic, I work in a parish beside Kilrea. 
We hold the place...

46:34.666 --> 46:36.386
working my ass off.

46:36.472 --> 46:38.646
Escorting the elderly, mobile confession.

46:38.732 --> 46:40.651
- The glamorous stuff.
- Oh, aye.

46:40.737 --> 46:44.524
- So, anyway, the position comes up in Kilrea.
- Right.

46:44.610 --> 46:47.715
And I'm passed over for some reason or other.
No reason, probably.

46:47.801 --> 46:50.195
- For taking too much cake off the old ladies.
- Probably.

46:50.281 --> 46:52.327
So?

46:52.517 --> 46:56.152
So five years later
the position again comes up back in Kilrea...

46:56.238 --> 47:02.295
- and my brother Michael waltzes right in to it.
- Fuck.

47:03.136 --> 47:05.548
He is made parish priest at 28.

47:05.634 --> 47:08.534
More spiritual probably. 
Less liberal than you.

47:08.620 --> 47:12.019
He worked the bishop. 
He's a golfer.

47:12.155 --> 47:15.052
- He's a pushy little twirp, that's what he is.
- At least you're not bitter.

47:15.138 --> 47:19.787
- Oh no, I couldn't be that.
- Parish priest at 28? Fantastic.

47:19.873 --> 47:22.019
He has two cars.

47:22.105 --> 47:26.182
And the house he has is the most.
He has a maid, a cook.

47:26.268 --> 47:28.268
I'm stuck in a two up two down,

47:28.354 --> 47:31.357
with a fat Kerry man 
who drones on and on about Gaelic football.

47:31.443 --> 47:34.686
Can we stop talking about that?
Jesus! You're the one who's talking.

47:37.512 --> 47:40.247
- How's your smoke going?
- Grand.

47:40.333 --> 47:43.521
- Filthy habit. Disgusting.
- Oh, yeah, awful. Lovely, though.

47:43.607 --> 47:46.287
Aye. Praise the Lord.

47:49.066 --> 47:52.841
- 28. My God!
- Oh, stop it.

47:55.554 --> 47:58.328
- So, what happened to your eye, Bobby?
- What?

47:58.414 --> 48:01.566
- You got to dig for yourself, your eye?
- Differences of opinion.

48:01.652 --> 48:05.612
- How's the other fellow?
- A lot worse. Believe me.

48:06.345 --> 48:09.739
- So, what did you call me here for?
- Why, was that the issue you were trying to avoid?

48:09.825 --> 48:11.901
Priest etiquette. 
Start with the small talk.

48:11.987 --> 48:13.965
I'm learning a lot about the priesthood, Don.

48:14.051 --> 48:16.325
- You'd make a fine priest.
- Why?

48:16.411 --> 48:20.121
- Good talker. Man of principles. A leader of men.
- A political terrorist.

48:20.207 --> 48:23.904
- The church loves a reformed crook.
- Aye.

48:25.332 --> 48:28.574
I always felt that thief next to Jesus got off lightly.

48:28.660 --> 48:31.102
- But he recognized his sins.
- Did he, though?

48:31.188 --> 48:33.267
Aye. Said as much.

48:33.353 --> 48:35.685
When you're hung from a cross 
you're gonna say anything.

48:35.771 --> 48:38.952
Jesus offers him a seat next to his Daddy,
in a place called Paradise.

48:39.038 --> 48:40.770
You know, you're always gonna put your hand up
and ask if you can have a piece of that.

48:40.856 --> 48:44.010
Aye. Even when he's nailed to a cross.

48:44.335 --> 48:46.737
- Jesus Christ! That's sacrilegious.
- Sacrilegious?

48:46.823 --> 48:50.272
- Aye.
- No, no. He was a dirty thief.

48:51.575 --> 48:54.692
So, what did you want me to tell me?

48:54.888 --> 48:56.979
Where are you at?

48:57.065 --> 48:59.396
Been driven mad by that Governor yet?

48:59.482 --> 49:02.080
Says he's been negotiating.

49:02.501 --> 49:04.476
It's been a sideshow.
I can tell you that for nothing.

49:04.562 --> 49:06.741
But you understand why you need to do it.

49:06.827 --> 49:11.658
- Because we are no longer good propaganda.
- According to whom? The leadership?

49:12.519 --> 49:16.762
The time has come.
A decision had to be made.

49:17.675 --> 49:20.266
Do you think that's what the leadership think?

49:20.352 --> 49:23.660
- Maybe. I do not know.
- Is there paranoia there, Bobby?

49:26.653 --> 49:29.594
Ten thousand people marched 
for seven hunger strikers last October, right?

49:29.680 --> 49:31.460
- Right.
- International pressure on the Brits and all that.

49:31.546 --> 49:34.381
- As your time...
- Even the Pope is having a say, getting involved.

49:34.467 --> 49:38.233
The whole world trying to get Maggie Thatcher 
to back down and give us our demands,

49:38.239 --> 49:39.369
but it all came to nothing.

49:39.455 --> 49:40.734
Right.

49:40.820 --> 49:43.086
The hunger strike failed.

49:43.172 --> 49:48.229
We are on the frontline. We created the protest. 
It's our responsibility.

49:48.315 --> 49:50.246
Leadership may be very clear to me, Don.

49:50.332 --> 49:52.287
Four and half years in a 'no wash' protest,

49:52.373 --> 49:55.120
as much as it has highlightes republicanism 
to some extent...

49:55.206 --> 49:57.722
it has also distracted 
from the wider development of the organization.

49:57.808 --> 50:01.331
- That's because your needs are specific needs.
- Of course they are.

50:01.417 --> 50:03.892
Some women bringing up three children in West Belfast,

50:03.978 --> 50:07.809
shouldn't care about civilian type clothes
or whatever the fuck they're calling these clown outfits.

50:07.895 --> 50:09.703
- Not so.
- Honest to God, Don.

50:09.789 --> 50:12.816
We were promised our own clothes.
It's childish sculduggery.

50:12.902 --> 50:15.798
So the leadership have had enough of you?

50:17.207 --> 50:19.087
In an ideal world...

50:19.173 --> 50:22.331
we would be fighting our battles independently,
but we're tied.

50:22.417 --> 50:24.366
Nothing has changed here,
nothing has moved on.

50:24.452 --> 50:25.644
The leadership are stuck with us,

50:25.730 --> 50:28.434
until there's some realistic chance
of moving towards political status.

50:28.520 --> 50:29.979
That's the hard truth of it.

50:30.065 --> 50:33.025
Say get me to negotiate with these lying, 
renegging monkeys,

50:33.111 --> 50:35.439
when there's never nothing on the table, 
it's just pure crap.

50:35.525 --> 50:37.563
I'm not going to be marching 
to this Governor's office

50:37.649 --> 50:41.569
and get caught up in some mindless,
pointless dialogue with that pompous bastard.

50:41.655 --> 50:44.418
- He is a big fan of yours.
- Take his two short planks, Don. A moron.

50:44.504 --> 50:47.402
Can you believe that they made him governor though?
It's a bloody insult to humanity.

50:47.488 --> 50:50.913
Mother of Jesus!
Where do you get your energy from?

50:51.055 --> 50:53.711
I was a cross-country runner when I was a boy.

50:54.060 --> 50:57.220
I could have guessed it. 
Big engine on you.

50:57.306 --> 50:59.953
Cross-country runner.

51:00.039 --> 51:03.915
- That explains a lot about you, Bobby.
- I loved it so bad.

51:04.001 --> 51:05.584
That's the whole country thing for me.

51:05.670 --> 51:09.406
Jesus! They'd have to hold me back at finishing line 
or I'd keep on running.

51:09.492 --> 51:12.256
I was seen as a mongrel from out of the city.

51:12.342 --> 51:14.681
Frightening the cattle and all. 
It was a funny time.

51:14.767 --> 51:17.608
- Frightened the cattle?
- Oh, I terrified them.

51:17.694 --> 51:21.735
Think you can get milk and burgers from them monsters? 
Jesus Christ!

51:24.557 --> 51:28.197
The next time round I'm gonna be born 
in the countryside, guaranteed.

51:28.283 --> 51:32.243
Wild life, birds.
I love all that. Paradise.

51:32.329 --> 51:37.399
- Aye. And you'd learn to relax too.
- Aye.

51:37.485 --> 51:41.273
Maybe, you never know. 
I've never tried it before.

51:42.253 --> 51:45.320
I'm starting a hunger strike on the 1st of March.

51:46.544 --> 51:49.572
That's why you're here.
That's what I'm telling you.

51:49.658 --> 51:52.513
Aye, I heard that.

51:55.714 --> 51:58.538
- Does your family know?
- I got word to them, aye.

51:58.624 --> 52:01.922
- Have you spoken with them?
- Got a visit in two week's time. We talked then.

52:02.008 --> 52:04.750
How do you think they will take it?

52:04.889 --> 52:08.790
- What do you think, Don?
- And your wee boy?

52:26.773 --> 52:30.747
So, what makes it different from the last time?

52:32.232 --> 52:34.226
Last time the strike was flawed.

52:34.312 --> 52:38.043
It became emotional.
Seven men started at the same time.

52:38.129 --> 52:39.902
They all got weak 
and couldn't let the weakest one die,

52:39.988 --> 52:42.215
which left us susceptible 
to being conned by the Brits,

52:42.301 --> 52:45.329
and that is exactly what we were.
Conned.

52:45.415 --> 52:48.608
This time out, 
the men will start consecutively two weeks apart.

52:48.694 --> 52:50.282
Somebody dies, they'll be replaced.

52:50.368 --> 52:53.420
There is no shortage of us.
Seventy five men have put their names forward.

52:53.506 --> 52:55.888
For Christ's sake.

52:55.974 --> 52:58.958
The announcement is being made today.

53:01.660 --> 53:06.149
So, what makes this protest different 
is that you accept to die, Bobby?

53:06.561 --> 53:08.132
It may well come to that.

53:08.218 --> 53:10.802
You start a hunger strike to protest 
for what you believe in.

53:10.888 --> 53:15.096
You don't start already determined to die,
or am I missing something here?

53:15.182 --> 53:19.549
It's in their hands. Our message is clear.
They're seeing our determination.

53:20.018 --> 53:23.465
So there'll be a couple of deaths, 
do you think, maybe five or six,

53:23.551 --> 53:27.336
- but you have seventy-five of you.
- Aye, well, it won't come to that.

53:27.422 --> 53:30.726
All right, maybe the Brits will buckle 
after twenty or so.

53:30.812 --> 53:34.585
But why should you care?
Because you're already dead, right?

53:43.699 --> 53:46.780
Have you thought about you're going 
to be putting these boys through?

53:46.866 --> 53:50.066
I mean, putting aside what's going to happen 
to these poor men's families.

53:50.152 --> 53:53.619
You're going head to head with the British Government
who declaredly despise republicanism,

53:53.705 --> 53:56.120
who are unshakeable.

53:56.206 --> 53:59.656
They can easily live with the deaths
of what they call terrorists.

53:59.742 --> 54:02.413
- And the stakes are much higher this time.
- I know that.

54:02.499 --> 54:05.741
And if you're not even willing to negotiate,
you're looking for them to capitulate.

54:05.827 --> 54:07.018
- Is that it?
- Right.

54:07.104 --> 54:11.638
So failure means many dead men, 
families torn apart,

54:11.724 --> 54:14.119
and the whole Republican movement demoralised.

54:14.205 --> 54:16.997
Aye. Worst case scenario 
it might well mean all that,

54:17.083 --> 54:19.112
- but in short term, under the ashes...
- Come on!

54:19.198 --> 54:21.456
Guaranteed, there will be a new generation
of men and women,

54:21.542 --> 54:24.070
- even more resilient, more determined.
- Look who you're talking to.

54:24.156 --> 54:27.638
There's a war going on, I thought you might understand. 
You're talking like a foreigner.

54:27.724 --> 54:30.389
You're talking to me like I'm a foreigner.
Do you think I don't know Northern Ireland?

54:30.475 --> 54:32.221
- I live here, man.
- Then support us.

54:32.307 --> 54:36.587
I supported the first hunger strike 
on the basis it was a protest.

54:36.673 --> 54:40.011
Not some pre-design to die
and balk at negotiation,

54:40.097 --> 54:43.732
other than complete surrender from Thatcher.
That's ridiculous Bobby. It's destructive.

54:43.818 --> 54:45.894
What's happened in here for the last four years?

54:45.980 --> 54:49.589
The brutality, humiliation.
Our basic human rights taken away from us.

54:49.675 --> 54:52.822
- All this must come to an end.
- Through talking.

54:53.068 --> 54:54.461
So what?

54:54.547 --> 54:56.124
We take their offer and put their uniform on?

54:56.210 --> 54:58.763
Because the last four years are meant nothing?

54:58.849 --> 55:02.389
We can do that, Don,
or we can behave like the army we proclaim to be

55:02.475 --> 55:04.166
and lay down our lives for our comrades.

55:04.252 --> 55:06.669
Is there not even small part in you
that's open for a breakthrough,

55:06.755 --> 55:10.058
- that could find you negotiating again?
- That won't happen.

55:10.144 --> 55:15.722
Forget about that. I want to know whether your intent 
is just purely to commit suicide here.

55:19.310 --> 55:20.437
You want me to argue...

55:20.523 --> 55:24.604
about the morality of what I'm about to do
and whether it's really suicide or not?

55:25.881 --> 55:28.339
For one in your corner it's suicide.
I call it murder.

55:28.425 --> 55:30.871
And that's just another wee difference 
between us two.

55:30.957 --> 55:33.402
We are both Catholic men.
Both Republicans.

55:33.488 --> 55:35.495
But while you were poaching salmon
in lovely Kilrea,

55:35.581 --> 55:37.364
- we were being burnt out of our houses in Rathcoole.
- Right.

55:37.450 --> 55:41.458
Similar in many ways, Don, 
but life and experience are focused up differently.

55:41.544 --> 55:42.999
- Do you understand me?
- I understand.

55:43.085 --> 55:47.834
I have my belief and in all its simplicity,
that is the most powerful thing.

55:49.173 --> 55:51.576
So what's your statement by dying?

55:52.845 --> 55:55.960
Just highlighting British intransigence, 
so fucking what?

55:56.046 --> 55:58.052
- The whole world knows what the Brits are like.
- Good.

55:58.138 --> 56:00.797
Aye. It is good.
And it has nothing to do with you.

56:00.883 --> 56:02.981
The Brits have been fucking up everything 
for centuries.

56:03.067 --> 56:06.546
- I can feel your hatred, Don.
- Are you looking for martyrdom?

56:06.632 --> 56:07.563
- No.
- Are you sure?

56:07.771 --> 56:08.467
Aye. 

56:08.553 --> 56:10.846
Because I've heard you eulogizing Wolf Tone,

56:10.932 --> 56:13.588
McConnely, Mike Sweeney, all them men.

56:13.674 --> 56:16.396
Don't talk thinking you're writing your name 
in laurels for all them history books.

56:16.482 --> 56:18.864
- Oh, and you think that matters to me?
- Aye, I know it does.

56:18.950 --> 56:21.091
Well, you're wrong.

56:22.200 --> 56:24.501
You say you're soldiers.

56:24.587 --> 56:27.543
It's all about the freedom.

56:27.629 --> 56:30.329
But you've got no appreciation of a life, Bobby.

56:30.415 --> 56:33.620
You no longer know what a life is, young man.

56:33.706 --> 56:36.954
Four years living in these conditions, 
no one expects you to be normal.

56:37.040 --> 56:39.415
There is nothing normal about you.

56:40.444 --> 56:44.359
Right now the Republican Movement 
has talked itself into a corner.

56:44.565 --> 56:49.360
You and the IRA are standing right behind it 
looking into that corner. All that history.

56:49.446 --> 56:53.041
All them dead men and women.
You're still saying nothing.

56:53.127 --> 56:55.660
And your answer is to kill everything,
you've blinded yourself.

56:55.746 --> 56:58.966
And you're scared to stop it.

56:59.725 --> 57:02.969
Afraid of living, afraid to talk in peace.

57:03.055 --> 57:06.479
So what would Ulster be 
if it wasn't turning itself to shit?

57:07.765 --> 57:09.867
And this situation here...

57:09.953 --> 57:13.470
the future of the Republican Movement
is in the hands of you men,

57:13.556 --> 57:17.441
who have lost all sense of reality.

57:17.649 --> 57:19.934
You think your head's on right?

57:21.401 --> 57:23.725
Locked up here 24 hours a day in piss and shit,

57:23.811 --> 57:26.762
and you are making decisions
that could see so many men die?

57:26.848 --> 57:30.671
Build a statue to Bobby Sands.
You're joking me!

57:30.757 --> 57:32.969
Freedom Fighter?

57:33.556 --> 57:36.148
They are the men and women
working out there in the community,

57:36.234 --> 57:39.605
and that was you once upon a time, 
am I right?

57:39.691 --> 57:42.486
All that work you did in Twin Brook.

57:42.633 --> 57:46.832
That is where we need you, Bobby,
and you know I'm right.

57:47.787 --> 57:50.747
But I'm deluded.
You want me to answer that?

57:50.833 --> 57:53.917
- They're beating your ball, here. You're playing into their hands.
- The strategy's in place.

57:53.918 --> 57:57.253
- Then stop it. Just say you'll stop.
- You don't understand a thing.

57:57.254 --> 57:59.928
You're in no shape to make this call.

57:59.929 --> 58:05.002
- It's done. It won't be stopped.
- Then fuck it! Life must mean nothing to you.

58:06.565 --> 58:09.296
God's gonna punish me.

58:14.514 --> 58:20.428
Well, if not just for the suicide, 
then he'd have to punish you for your stupidity.

58:21.610 --> 58:23.397
Aye.

58:23.483 --> 58:25.901
And you for your arrogance.

58:25.987 --> 58:29.378
Because my life is a real life,
not some theological exercise,

58:29.464 --> 58:32.715
some religious trick
that's got to fuck all to do with living.

58:33.234 --> 58:34.547
Jesus Christ had a backbone,

58:34.633 --> 58:37.189
but see them disciples, every disciple since?

58:37.275 --> 58:40.892
You're just jumping in and out of the rhetoric
and dead-end semantics.

58:40.978 --> 58:42.233
You need the revolutionaries.

58:42.319 --> 58:44.614
You need the cultural political soldier 
to give life a pulse,

58:44.700 --> 58:47.068
- to give life a direction.
- This is stupid talk. You're deluded.

58:47.154 --> 58:48.987
Aye. So you say.

58:49.073 --> 58:51.560
- And what's your wee son going to say?
- Fuck off.

58:51.646 --> 58:53.712
Doesn't that interest you?

58:53.870 --> 58:56.177
You're going to attack me with sentiment?

58:56.501 --> 58:58.280
- Typical priest.
- What's your heart saying, Bobby?

58:58.366 --> 59:02.510
- I thought you had me all figured out, Don.
- What is it saying? Tell me.

59:05.817 --> 59:09.421
My life means everything to me.
Freedom means everything.

59:10.102 --> 59:13.857
I know that you don't mean to mock me, Don.
So I just let all that pass.

59:14.560 --> 59:17.183
This is one of those times when we've come to a pause.

59:17.269 --> 59:19.953
It's a time to keep your beliefs pure.

59:20.039 --> 59:23.818
I believe that a united Ireland is right and just.

59:24.236 --> 59:27.662
Maybe it's impossible 
for a man like you to understand.

59:28.156 --> 59:29.884
But having respect for my life,

59:29.970 --> 59:33.617
a desire for freedom,
an unyielding love for that belief,

59:33.703 --> 59:37.013
means I can see past any doubts I may have.

59:37.970 --> 59:41.069
Putting my life on the line is not just 
the only thing I can do, Don.

59:41.155 --> 59:43.267
It's the right thing.

59:48.080 --> 59:50.731
This is why you called me here.

59:51.458 --> 59:54.919
Needed a sounding board?
Not 100% sure of yourself.

59:55.005 --> 59:58.632
- Endebting yourself, maybe?
- Aye.

59:58.918 --> 01:00:02.829
- Well, I'm only human.
- And I've made it clear for you, then.

01:00:04.373 --> 01:00:08.610
Man of the guidance, Don. 
Business of the soul.

01:00:19.294 --> 01:00:22.697
You been to Gweedore, in Donegal?

01:00:22.962 --> 01:00:24.004
Aye.

01:00:31.955 --> 01:00:34.434
I went there when I was 12.

01:00:35.741 --> 01:00:38.353
Big cross-country race for the boys.

01:00:38.439 --> 01:00:42.728
And we were all in the back of a minibus 
headed towards Derry one morning.

01:00:43.309 --> 01:00:45.714
I mean, this is big time.

01:00:45.927 --> 01:00:50.908
I mean, this is like international athletics for us
because we were racing against boys in the South

01:00:50.994 --> 01:00:54.070
and we had this thing to do Belfast pride.

01:00:55.222 --> 01:00:59.476
A few boys were Protestants
and the rest of us were Catholics.

01:00:59.562 --> 01:01:01.672
It was a cross-community event.

01:01:01.758 --> 01:01:04.970
I suppose the good people in the south 
think this is great stuff.

01:01:05.056 --> 01:01:09.475
Let's get this wee team over from Belfast
and all that patronizing shit.

01:01:11.819 --> 01:01:13.081
Anyway...

01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:16.373
we went through the border.

01:01:17.665 --> 01:01:20.738
The boys singing pop tunes and all...

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:24.210
but I'm just in the back of the bus 
looking out the window.

01:01:25.456 --> 01:01:30.554
We're going through the mountains. 
You know, where Mount Errigal is in them?

01:01:31.367 --> 01:01:34.186
It's a beautiful sight, Don.

01:01:34.799 --> 01:01:38.522
Donegal is the most beautiful place in Ireland, 
I reckon.

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:40.563
Aye.

01:01:47.048 --> 01:01:49.371
Anyway...

01:01:50.788 --> 01:01:57.795
when we arrived at Gweedore... what a place. 
There were about 200 boys in there,

01:01:57.881 --> 01:02:00.645
getting into their gear and limnering up.

01:02:01.501 --> 01:02:03.084
The whole event is run by Christian Brothers

01:02:03.070 --> 01:02:08.501
and they're clipping young fellows around in the back of the ears,
basically trying to obtain some order.

01:02:09.290 --> 01:02:12.925
Our team goes off for a wee jog, 
to stretch out the legs.

01:02:14.754 --> 01:02:18.509
And we're surrounded by fields of barley.

01:02:18.726 --> 01:02:21.637
And I dip down into a wee valley 
where there's a stream

01:02:21.638 --> 01:02:23.665
and woods running through it.

01:02:26.514 --> 01:02:29.314
The woods and the stream are out of bounds 
so, naturally,

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:32.123
us Belfast boys had to go check it, right?

01:02:32.209 --> 01:02:35.607
The woods and the stream 
seemed like the Amazon to us.

01:02:37.264 --> 01:02:41.058
As we come across, 
these young fellows from Cork...

01:02:41.144 --> 01:02:42.967
there's some banter about our accents...

01:02:43.053 --> 01:02:46.667
They could barely talk, 
we couldn't understand what they were saying.

01:02:47.334 --> 01:02:50.065
You get the idea that they are lording it over us...

01:02:50.151 --> 01:02:53.417
Looking down on us, I'm sensing it anyway.

01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:56.128
We run along...

01:02:56.214 --> 01:03:01.130
and we come up with this idea to go down to the stream 
and check it out for fish.

01:03:01.582 --> 01:03:06.655
So we went to the river, downstream,
and there's half a foot of water there...

01:03:06.852 --> 01:03:09.277
and a silver fish, but nothing substantial,

01:03:09.363 --> 01:03:12.406
until one of our boys calls us further down.

01:03:13.618 --> 01:03:16.840
Lying in the water is a wee foal...

01:03:16.926 --> 01:03:21.508
four or five days old. 
He was all skin and bone, a gray color.

01:03:21.594 --> 01:03:26.739
And it's got flakes of blood in his coat 
because he's cut himself up really badly in the sharp rocks...

01:03:29.344 --> 01:03:33.210
We were standing over him 
and you could see his back legs snapped...

01:03:33.296 --> 01:03:36.691
He's breathing, he's alive, 
but just about.

01:03:38.506 --> 01:03:43.875
So this big conversation gets started up between the boys 
who suddenly reckon themselves the leaders...

01:03:43.961 --> 01:03:46.138
and deliberating as what we should do.

01:03:46.224 --> 01:03:48.027
Someone says drop a rock on his head,

01:03:48.113 --> 01:03:51.915
but I'm looking in their faces 
and I can see they are either scared stiff or clueless.

01:03:52.001 --> 01:03:54.141
It's all bravado.

01:03:54.618 --> 01:03:58.176
And this foal on the ground in real pain.

01:03:58.262 --> 01:04:01.883
All this chitchat going on going nowhere.

01:04:03.004 --> 01:04:06.369
Next thing, one of the priests sees us, 
sees the foal,

01:04:06.455 --> 01:04:08.125
tells us not to move it 
and that we were done for...

01:04:08.211 --> 01:04:09.770
We were really done for.

01:04:09.856 --> 01:04:11.979
Group of boys will always get the blame 
for hurting a foal.

01:04:12.065 --> 01:04:14.922
A group of Belfast boys
will get a hammering for sure.

01:04:15.008 --> 01:04:16.709
So it's clear to me in an instant.

01:04:16.795 --> 01:04:21.686
I get down on my knees and take the foal's head 
in my hands and I put him underwater.

01:04:21.962 --> 01:04:26.525
He's thrashing around a bit at the start, 
so I press down harder until he's drowned.

01:04:28.626 --> 01:04:30.991
The priests arrived, Don.

01:04:31.836 --> 01:04:36.570
Just grabbing me by the hair, dragging me through the woods, 
promising me a proper punishment.

01:04:36.656 --> 01:04:40.023
But I knew I did the right thing 
by that wee foal...

01:04:40.691 --> 01:04:44.023
and I could take the punishment for all our boys.

01:04:44.148 --> 01:04:48.315
I had the respect of the other boys now, 
and I knew that.

01:04:54.432 --> 01:04:56.877
I'm clear of the reasons, Don.

01:04:57.266 --> 01:05:00.594
And clear of all the repercussions.

01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:04.925
But I will act and I will not stand by 
and do nothing.

01:05:41.114 --> 01:05:43.438
You can leave them there if you like.

01:05:43.524 --> 01:05:46.888
Don't want me rolling up 
the letter of St. John, do you?

01:05:51.766 --> 01:05:54.832
Couldn't have that in my conscience, no.

01:06:01.857 --> 01:06:05.036
I don't think I'm gonna see you again, Bobby.

01:06:06.167 --> 01:06:08.659
There's no need, Don.

01:09:35.225 --> 01:09:40.000
<i>Faced now with the failure 
of their discredited cause,</i>

01:09:40.086 --> 01:09:43.140
<i>the men of violence 
have chosen in recent months</i>

01:09:43.227 --> 01:09:48.118
<i>to play what may well be their last card.</i>

01:09:48.203 --> 01:09:51.145
<i>They have turned their violence 
against themselves</i>

01:09:51.231 --> 01:09:55.376
<i>through the prison hunger strike to death.</i>

01:09:55.462 --> 01:10:01.414
<i>They seek to work on the most basic
of human emotions, pity...</i>

01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:03.926
<i>as a means of creating tension</i>

01:10:04.012 --> 01:10:08.246
<i>and stoking the fires 
of bitterness and hatred.</i>

01:10:38.334 --> 01:10:43.711
And from week one there has been a gradual deterioration
of the liver, kidney, and pancreatic function.

01:10:44.548 --> 01:10:49.777
Also the bone density decreases substantially 
due to calcium and vitamin deficiencies.

01:10:53.006 --> 01:10:54.935
The muscles of the heart is also undernourished,

01:10:55.021 --> 01:10:58.572
causing impaired function
and eventually cardiac failure.

01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:08.589
The left ventricle can shrink to 70%
of its normal size.

01:11:10.826 --> 01:11:15.393
He will have low blood sugar, 
low energy and muscular wasting.

01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:21.477
He will be experiencing gastro-intestinal ulcers 
with the thinning of the intestinal wall

01:11:21.563 --> 01:11:24.437
and sub-mucosal hemorraging.

01:11:26.296 --> 01:11:29.805
There will have been degenerative changes
to the mucous membranes of the intestines

01:11:29.891 --> 01:11:33.169
and indeed all the organs in the body.

01:18:27.163 --> 01:18:30.045
UDA (Ulster Defense Alliance)

01:21:38.888 --> 01:21:42.321
- Name?
- Roselyn Sands.

01:21:45.220 --> 01:21:48.759
- Name?
- John Sands.

01:23:56.762 --> 01:24:01.110
<i>- People always ask us
- People always ask us</i>

01:24:01.196 --> 01:24:04.353
- Bobby, Bobby!
<i>- Who we are</i>

01:24:04.439 --> 01:24:07.857
<i>- And where we come from
- And where we come from</i>

01:24:07.943 --> 01:24:11.423
<i>- And we tell them

01:24:11.509 --> 01:24:14.983
<i>- We're from Belfast

01:24:15.069 --> 01:24:18.687
<i>- The mighty, mighty Belfast
- The mighty, mighty Belfast</i>

01:24:18.773 --> 01:24:22.535
<i>- And if they can't hear us
- And if they can't hear us</i>

01:24:22.621 --> 01:24:26.880
<i>- We shout a little louder
- We shout a little louder</i>
