no one here besides you

00:14.465 --> 00:16.434

That's right.

Good morning.

04:07.698 --> 04:09.400
After the meeting,

04:09.434 --> 04:11.903
we have to find
a new stash house.

04:11.937 --> 04:13.871
What's wrong with this one?

Uh, it's too understated.

04:16.207 --> 04:19.277
I'd like to find something

I don't think showing up high
to Avi Benhamou's house

would be
strategically sound.

04:43.935 --> 04:46.704
Well, like, I said, I don't
think you should show up at all.

04:46.737 --> 04:48.306
All right, look,
I gotta run some errands.

04:48.339 --> 04:51.909
So wait an hour,
pack up the rest, and then, uh,

04:51.943 --> 04:55.446
meet me at that parking garage
on Sunset, behind Carney's.

money, not family photos.

06:00.045 --> 06:03.981
Where is it, Oso? Mm?

06:04.015 --> 06:06.884
I'll give you the money
when I feel safe.

06:06.917 --> 06:09.887
Safe from what?

06:09.920 --> 06:12.323
The kind of man who steals
from his own father.

06:12.357 --> 06:14.792
Gustavo, we weren't stealing
the money -- (gun cocks)

-Stop it! You want the money?
-Yeah, I want the fucking money.

If you kill him, we're never gonna see it.
I'm not gonna kill him.

06:22.733 --> 06:25.170
I'm gonna put holes in him
until he gives it up.

06:25.203 --> 06:29.507
Pedro, look at me. Can you come
talk to me, please? Please.

06:29.540 --> 06:32.543
-Pedro, Pedro, look at me.
-(Speaks Spanish)

06:32.577 --> 06:35.980
Stop. Put the gun down.
