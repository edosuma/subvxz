WEBVTT

00:06.500 --> 00:08.660
So, Ferb, what do you wanna do today?

00:10.020 --> 00:11.026
What about Perry?

00:11.050 --> 00:12.290
What does he want to do?

00:14.720 --> 00:16.286
Well, he's a platypus.

00:16.309 --> 00:17.426
They don't do much.

00:17.450 --> 00:19.246
I for one, am starting to get bored,

00:19.270 --> 00:21.666
and boredom is something of
up with which I will not put!

00:21.690 --> 00:23.986
The first thing they're gonna ask
us when we get back to school is

00:24.010 --> 00:25.296
"what did we do over the summer?".

00:25.320 --> 00:26.862
I mean, no school for three months.

00:26.886 --> 00:28.486
Our life should be a roller coaster!

00:28.510 --> 00:30.176
And I mean a good roller coaster,

00:30.200 --> 00:32.320
not like that one we
rode at the state fair.

00:35.220 --> 00:36.420
Please exit to the left.

00:36.610 --> 00:37.696
Man, that was lame.

00:37.720 --> 00:39.546
Why, if I built a roller
coaster, I would...

00:39.570 --> 00:41.746
- That's it!
- I know what we're gonna do today!

00:41.770 --> 00:44.126
- Phineas, Ferb!
- I'm gonna go pick up a few things.

00:44.150 --> 00:46.430
- You boys stays out of trouble, okay?
- Okay, Mom.

00:46.810 --> 00:49.050
We're gonna build a roller coaster!

00:50.590 --> 00:52.806
- I'm in charge, right?
- You did tell them I'm in charge.

00:52.830 --> 00:53.727
Relax, Candace.

00:53.751 --> 00:54.986
Nobody has to be in charge.

00:55.010 --> 00:56.426
But what if there's an emergency?

00:56.450 --> 00:57.276
Like what?

00:57.300 --> 00:58.300
What if, uh...

00:58.610 --> 01:02.600
What if a satellite falls out of
orbit and crashes into the house?

01:02.810 --> 01:05.190
- If that happens, you're in charge.
- Yes.

01:05.670 --> 01:07.530
Mom says I'm in charge,
conditionally.

01:07.690 --> 01:09.346
- Whatever.
- Wait a minute.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.340
- What are you doing?
- Homework.

01:11.510 --> 01:12.626
It's summer.

01:12.650 --> 01:14.790
That's cool,
you wait till the last minute then.

01:15.360 --> 01:16.850
Well, I'm watching you.

01:18.140 --> 01:20.340
And I'm in charge...
conditionally!

01:23.510 --> 01:25.120
- Hello?
- Oh, hi, Stacy!

01:25.260 --> 01:26.706
No, I can't get to the mall right now.

01:26.730 --> 01:27.556
Mom just went to the store,

01:27.580 --> 01:28.566
she left me in charge,

01:28.590 --> 01:29.866
well, you know, conditionally.

01:29.890 --> 01:32.106
Oh, if you go, can you
see if Jeremy is there?

01:32.130 --> 01:34.746
No, no, he's the cute one that works at Mr.
Slushy Burger.

01:34.770 --> 01:37.136
Yeah, he totally smiled at me
the last time I was there.

01:37.160 --> 01:38.420
I just about died!

01:38.950 --> 01:40.076
No, I told you I can't,

01:40.100 --> 01:41.396
I'm watching my brother and step-brother.

01:41.420 --> 01:42.566
Yeah, and they never get into trouble,

01:42.590 --> 01:43.716
'cause Mom never catches them.

01:43.740 --> 01:44.976
One of these days though,

01:45.000 --> 01:47.320
I'm going to see the two as
she catches them red handed.

01:48.230 --> 01:49.276
Will you hold it down?

01:49.300 --> 01:50.950
I am trying to use the phone!

01:51.410 --> 01:53.880
Mom left me in charge, so there
will be no shenanigans today.

01:54.150 --> 01:54.966
What are doing right now?

01:54.990 --> 01:55.990
Why do you ask?

01:56.110 --> 01:58.046
What do you mean you can
see it from your house?

01:58.070 --> 01:59.070
See what?!

02:02.050 --> 02:03.556
Phineas, what is this?!

02:03.580 --> 02:04.377
Do you like it?

02:04.401 --> 02:05.766
Ooh, I'm gonna go tell Mom,

02:05.790 --> 02:07.096
and when she sees what you're doing,

02:07.120 --> 02:08.520
you are going down!

02:08.680 --> 02:10.210
Down, down, down!

02:10.710 --> 02:12.770
D-O-W-N, down!

02:13.480 --> 02:16.030
We're gonna need a blowtorch
and some more peanut butter.

02:16.180 --> 02:17.540
Hey Candace. Is Phineas...

02:18.380 --> 02:19.410
home?

02:20.930 --> 02:22.810
Down, down, I say!

02:23.930 --> 02:25.316
Hey, Phineas.

02:25.340 --> 02:26.037
Hey, Isabella.

02:26.061 --> 02:27.256
Whatcha doin'?

02:27.280 --> 02:28.446
Building a roller coaster.

02:28.470 --> 02:29.447
In your backyard?

02:29.471 --> 02:30.536
Some of it.

02:30.560 --> 02:31.087
Wow.

02:31.111 --> 02:32.906
Isn't that kind of impossible?

02:32.930 --> 02:33.896
Some might say.

02:33.920 --> 02:34.920
Hey, Ferb.

02:36.630 --> 02:38.236
Does your step-brother ever talk?

02:38.260 --> 02:38.787
Ferb?

02:38.811 --> 02:40.650
He's more of a man of action.

02:43.400 --> 02:44.676
I was gonna go to the pool,

02:44.700 --> 02:45.770
you wanna go swimming?

02:46.260 --> 02:47.896
Kind of in the middle of something here.

02:47.920 --> 02:48.920
Oh, right.

02:49.200 --> 02:50.676
Okay, I'll see you later then.

02:50.700 --> 02:51.700
Okay.

02:51.920 --> 02:54.070
Hey, Ferb, you got enough rivets up there?

02:59.550 --> 03:01.070
Hey, where's Perry?

03:03.000 --> 03:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:11.030 --> 03:12.140
Good morning, Agent P.

03:12.260 --> 03:14.906
The evil Dr. Doofenshmirtz
is up to his old tricks.

03:14.930 --> 03:18.160
For reasons unknown to us, he bought
up 80% of the country's tin foil.

03:18.480 --> 03:20.176
I want you to get over to
his hideout right away,

03:20.200 --> 03:21.276
find out what he's up to,

03:21.300 --> 03:22.636
and put a stop to it.

03:22.660 --> 03:23.617
As always Agent P,

03:23.641 --> 03:26.956
it is important that your cover identity
as a mindless domestic pet remains intact.

03:26.980 --> 03:28.286
Now, get out there.

03:28.310 --> 03:29.900
We're all counting on you.

03:39.060 --> 03:39.907
So, the way I see it,

03:39.931 --> 03:42.480
the soil fuel rockets kick in
at the mall's parking lot.

03:42.690 --> 03:45.326
Then we release the snakes during
the corkscrew at the interstate.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.150
I'm gonna go get the snakes.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.430
Mom, you gotta come
home, right now.

03:52.630 --> 03:54.136
Did a satellite crash into the house?

03:54.160 --> 03:54.837
No, no, no!

03:54.861 --> 03:56.846
You gotta see what Phineas
and Ferb are doing!

03:56.870 --> 03:58.740
Seems like we've had this
conversation before.

03:58.860 --> 03:59.507
What do you mean?

03:59.531 --> 04:01.336
I seem to recall you
telling me that the boys

04:01.360 --> 04:03.006
were training monkeys
to juggle bicycles.

04:03.030 --> 04:05.366
And when I come home, there was
a stunning lack of monkeys.

04:05.390 --> 04:07.156
I still don't know how they
cleaned that up so fast.

04:07.180 --> 04:08.716
So, what's the emergency this time?

04:08.740 --> 04:10.516
They're building a roller coaster!

04:10.540 --> 04:12.250
Candace, seriously,

04:12.440 --> 04:15.240
isn't Phineas a little young to
be a roller coaster engineer?

04:17.470 --> 04:20.426
Aren't you a little young to
be a roller coaster engineer?

04:20.450 --> 04:21.055
Yes.

04:21.079 --> 04:22.079
Yes I am.

04:23.690 --> 04:25.697
Well, I must say, I'm very impressed.

04:25.721 --> 04:27.693
The forms all seems to be
in order, although I'd

04:27.717 --> 04:29.536
never seen them filled
out in crayon before.

04:29.560 --> 04:32.346
So, if there's anything I can get you,
anything at all, just let me know.

04:32.370 --> 04:34.400
Do you think we could borrow
one of those gadgets?

04:39.280 --> 04:40.940
Now, this is the life.

04:47.590 --> 04:51.680
Ah, Perry the Platypus, what
an unexpected surprise.

04:52.120 --> 04:55.040
And by unexpected, I mean:
Completely expected!

04:58.280 --> 05:03.800
I, Doctor Heinz Doofenshmirtz, have covered
the entire eastern seaboard in tin foil.

05:04.430 --> 05:07.356
And when I put my giant
magnet, next to my genius,

05:07.380 --> 05:09.366
Magnetism Magnifier,

05:09.390 --> 05:12.676
I will pull the East,
in westerly direction,

05:12.700 --> 05:15.716
thereby reversing the
rotation of the earth!

05:15.740 --> 05:17.706
You may well ask yourself,

05:17.730 --> 05:19.446
"why would he do this?"

05:19.470 --> 05:22.176
"What could he possibly have to gain?"

05:22.200 --> 05:24.416
Well, let me just answer that question,

05:24.440 --> 05:26.346
I haven't really worked
on all the bugs yet.

05:26.370 --> 05:28.970
I mean, you know, tin
foil alone costs a lot.

05:29.870 --> 05:31.136
But Mom, I'm telling you,

05:31.160 --> 05:32.800
they're building
it, and it's huge!

05:33.840 --> 05:37.126
"Phineas and Ferb present the
Coolest Coaster Ever, now open"?

05:37.150 --> 05:38.186
Mom!

05:38.210 --> 05:39.966
Phineas and Ferb got a roller coaster?

05:39.990 --> 05:41.736
You'd think we get a discount
if we bring the flier?

05:41.760 --> 05:42.760
Maybe we better take it.

05:43.060 --> 05:44.177
Here, look, look, look, see?

05:44.201 --> 05:45.546
I told you I'm not crazy!

05:45.570 --> 05:46.417
I told you!

05:46.441 --> 05:48.460
And you're not crazy because?

05:49.360 --> 05:50.430
(screams)

05:50.990 --> 05:52.126
I see your point, Candace.

05:52.150 --> 05:54.146
No crazy person would
scream at a post like that.

05:54.170 --> 05:57.330
I'll be at the dairy section if you wanna
come yell at some cheese or anything.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.716
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

06:15.740 --> 06:17.176
children of all ages!

06:17.200 --> 06:20.529
May I present to you a spectacle
most of the morning in the making!

06:21.460 --> 06:22.890
The Coolest...

06:23.430 --> 06:24.500
Coaster...

06:25.220 --> 06:27.200
EVER!

06:41.430 --> 06:43.090
So, who wants to go first?

06:45.330 --> 06:47.370
To fasten, insert the tab
inside the metal buckle.

06:47.880 --> 06:50.420
To release, just pull
back on the-Oops.

06:50.780 --> 06:51.820
Well, you get the picture.

06:52.290 --> 06:53.176
Well, that's about it.

06:53.200 --> 06:54.200
Enjoy the ride.

06:57.510 --> 06:59.070
You guys all signed the waivers, right?

07:09.720 --> 07:11.650
Relax, they're just rubber.

07:25.270 --> 07:27.590
Hey, look, there comes the A-A-A-A!

07:32.970 --> 07:34.446
Really make my money back.

07:34.470 --> 07:36.664
I-I-I could by a bunch of
east-facing real estate,

07:36.688 --> 07:38.666
and sell it again with
an unsentimental view.

07:38.690 --> 07:39.690
I just...

07:40.050 --> 07:40.637
Ha!

07:40.661 --> 07:42.120
You missed!

07:45.010 --> 07:46.236
Aaahh!

07:46.260 --> 07:47.960
Ow, ow, ow, owwwww!

07:54.360 --> 07:55.390
Owww!

07:58.830 --> 08:00.650
Now, you are too late!

08:05.380 --> 08:07.557
Quake in your boots and watch helplessly,

08:07.581 --> 08:10.796
as the unimaginable electromagnetic forces,

08:10.820 --> 08:13.196
pull the eastern seaboard,

08:13.220 --> 08:16.560
thereby reversing the rotation of the...

08:18.600 --> 08:20.650
Well, that didn't work.

08:23.870 --> 08:28.716
And now, we have a two ton ball of tin foil
traveling 200 miles an hour directly at us!

08:28.740 --> 08:29.567
Quickly,

08:29.591 --> 08:33.429
we must separate the magnet from the
Magnifier before it's too late!

08:33.890 --> 08:35.626
Now I know I have that club
card in here somewhere.

08:35.650 --> 08:38.265
I always have it with me, but
my purse is a disaster area,

08:38.289 --> 08:39.289
you know how it is.

08:40.490 --> 08:41.645
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

08:41.669 --> 08:43.510
Mom!

08:44.340 --> 08:45.296
It's no use!

08:45.320 --> 08:47.710
It's no use, we are doomed!

08:53.520 --> 08:54.296
You did it!

08:54.320 --> 08:57.066
You saved us, Perry the Platypus...

08:57.090 --> 09:00.620
Curse you, Perry the Platypus!

09:08.310 --> 09:09.630
Look, look, look, see?

09:12.070 --> 09:12.907
Okay, I give up.

09:12.931 --> 09:14.371
What am I supposed to be looking at?

09:15.790 --> 09:16.487
No!

09:16.511 --> 09:17.676
It's not possible!

09:17.700 --> 09:18.746
I'm gonna go get the cart.

09:18.770 --> 09:21.060
It was right here, and it was huge!

09:21.660 --> 09:22.220
Mom!

09:22.370 --> 09:22.827
Time to go.

09:22.851 --> 09:23.870
I've got frozens.

09:24.920 --> 09:25.247
Okay,

09:25.271 --> 09:27.090
so you think that Phineas
and Ferb are still

09:27.114 --> 09:29.016
under that stupid tree
in the backyard, right?

09:29.040 --> 09:30.676
Well, yes. That would be my guess.

09:30.700 --> 09:31.106
Fine.

09:31.130 --> 09:32.860
Then lets go home, now!

09:43.630 --> 09:45.000
Oh, there you are, Perry.

09:46.710 --> 09:47.710
Nice hat, Isabella.

09:57.760 --> 09:58.327
Funny,

09:58.351 --> 09:59.980
I don't remember this in the blueprints.

10:02.050 --> 10:03.690
And I'm sure this is new.

10:06.870 --> 10:08.310
Ee-eee-ee,

10:08.620 --> 10:09.106
ha-hah-ha.

10:09.130 --> 10:10.930
I worry about you sometimes, Candace.\R.

10:21.910 --> 10:24.086
Welcome to Mr. Slushy Burger.
May I take your order?

10:24.110 --> 10:25.530
Anyone want fries?

10:30.440 --> 10:31.347
Croissant?

10:31.371 --> 10:33.130
Anyone want a croissant?\R.

10:43.520 --> 10:46.330
You know, if that thing crashes
into earth, Candace is in charge.

11:03.490 --> 11:04.970
We should have charged more.

11:06.450 --> 11:07.186
Okay, we're here.

11:07.210 --> 11:08.470
Are you happy now, Candace?

11:10.610 --> 11:11.476
Yes!

11:11.500 --> 11:12.167
See, Mom?

11:12.191 --> 11:13.520
I told you they weren't there!

11:14.130 --> 11:14.997
Oh, hi, boys.

11:15.021 --> 11:15.966
Hi, Mom.

11:15.990 --> 11:17.937
Come on, Candace, help
me with the groceries.

11:17.961 --> 11:19.620
But-but-but-but-but-but-but...
Let's go.

11:23.110 --> 11:24.306
Hey Phineas, that was great.

11:24.330 --> 11:25.330
Way too cool.

11:25.930 --> 11:27.366
That was awesome!

11:27.390 --> 11:28.207
Can we do it again?

11:28.231 --> 11:29.880
Sorry, only one ride per customer.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.376
That was great, Phineas.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.706
So, what are you gonna do tomorrow?

11:32.730 --> 11:33.786
Don't know yet.

11:33.810 --> 11:35.486
Maybe you could teach Perry some tricks.

11:35.510 --> 11:37.886
Well, he is a platypus, they don't do much.

11:37.910 --> 11:39.720
They're the only mammals to lay eggs.

11:41.530 --> 11:42.756
Maybe he'll lay an egg.

11:42.780 --> 11:44.350
Cool, see you tomorrow.

11:45.490 --> 11:47.580
It really was the coolest coaster ever.

11:47.850 --> 11:49.260
You guys makes a great team.

11:49.590 --> 11:51.000
Well, a brother is a brother.

11:51.190 --> 11:53.296
But I couldn't have asked
for a better one than Ferb.

11:53.320 --> 11:54.320
You know what I mean?

11:54.750 --> 11:55.776
(burps)

11:55.800 --> 11:57.026
Oh-ho-ho, man!

11:57.050 --> 11:58.387
I could smell the peanut butter!

11:58.411 --> 11:59.750
Well, that was impressive.

12:00.140 --> 12:01.140
See you guys.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.540
So, what should we do tomorrow?

12:03.980 --> 12:05.580
There's a world of possibilities.

12:06.080 --> 12:07.990
Maybe we should make a list.

12:10.510 --> 12:11.137
Mom!

12:11.161 --> 12:13.230
Give it a rest, Candace!
