03:11.358 --> 03:12.769
I can't believe this.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.597
Why not?

03:15.762 --> 03:18.265
Because I love you,
Fabio, like a son.

03:18.431 --> 03:21.935
I love you, Don Luis,
like a father.

03:24.437 --> 03:26.542
I'm going to miss you.

03:27.440 --> 03:29.317
And I'm going to miss you.

03:31.444 --> 03:34.186
Okay. Enough of this
sentimental bullshit.

03:34.347 --> 03:36.850
One last drink?
Next we'll be crying

03:37.017 --> 03:39.554
like two old women.
Come on!

03:41.621 --> 03:42.998
To the future.

03:53.133 --> 03:55.579
So business is all clear?

03:59.739 --> 04:01.480
It's all here.

04:04.310 --> 04:06.551
No other copies?
You have to ask?

04:06.713 --> 04:07.885
Hey, hey, hey.

04:08.048 --> 04:10.050
Oh, come on, eh?

04:16.822 --> 04:18.769
I'm going to miss you.

04:19.492 --> 04:20.596
Adiós, Marco.

04:30.837 --> 04:32.874
Kill this motherfucker.

04:45.418 --> 04:46.954
Not okay, boss?

04:47.120 --> 04:49.691
The bastard thinks I'm an idiot,
playing it mellow.

04:49.856 --> 04:52.860
If he screamed and threatened
to kill my family,

04:53.026 --> 04:54.528
it would've been better!

04:54.694 --> 04:57.106
We have an hour
to get out of here at the most.

05:32.732 --> 05:34.336
We've got 10 minutes.

05:35.735 --> 05:38.511
Cataleya, go pack.
I'm packed, Mama.

05:51.084 --> 05:52.688
Cataleya.

05:55.688 --> 05:57.634
In case anything happens,

05:57.790 --> 06:00.430
this-- This is your passport.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.102
You find yourself alone,

06:03.263 --> 06:05.300
you go to the address
on this card,

06:05.465 --> 06:08.344
you show it to the man
at the gate.

06:09.769 --> 06:11.442
I don't understand, Papa.

06:11.604 --> 06:13.515
Cata, you don't
have to understand.

06:13.673 --> 06:17.018
You just have to listen
and remember.

06:17.177 --> 06:18.815
Now...

06:28.721 --> 06:32.794
And this,
this will keep you safe.

06:34.494 --> 06:36.132
The Cattleya orchid.

06:36.296 --> 06:39.038
My mother, your grandmother,
used to grow them.

06:39.199 --> 06:42.476
Every morning,
I'd wake up to the sight of them,

06:42.635 --> 06:44.546
the smell of them.

06:45.572 --> 06:49.145
That's why
I named you Cataleya.

06:49.809 --> 06:51.880
Never forget
where you came from.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.604
We want to see Don Fabio.

07:11.397 --> 07:12.933
He is not home.

07:15.401 --> 07:17.005
I'm ready.

07:29.349 --> 07:30.623
Back! Back! Back!

07:36.956 --> 07:38.799
He said he's not home yet.

07:40.026 --> 07:41.528
Wait a minute.

07:42.228 --> 07:43.730
It's too late.
Get ready.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.302
Go. Go.

07:52.038 --> 07:55.815
I love you very much.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.920
I love you too, Papa.

08:03.916 --> 08:06.453
Do it now.
Okay.

08:06.619 --> 08:07.654
Change of plans.

08:27.907 --> 08:29.147
Cata.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.626
Alicia!

10:18.951 --> 10:20.362
Fabio...

10:21.687 --> 10:26.227
...you should know
that you don't leave Don Luis.

10:28.361 --> 10:29.897
Only die.

10:42.308 --> 10:45.778
Hey, what are you doing?
Don Luis said kill everyone.

10:45.945 --> 10:50.121
He also said no names.
She won't remember.

10:50.783 --> 10:53.229
She's a kid.
So what?

10:58.925 --> 11:01.235
What do you mean, "So what?" Hm?

11:01.394 --> 11:02.737
What do you mean?

11:11.270 --> 11:13.614
Do you remember me, Cataleya?

11:15.975 --> 11:18.251
I was at your
confirmation.

11:18.411 --> 11:22.587
My name is Marco, and I was a
very good friend of your father.

11:23.616 --> 11:27.325
You know who Don Luis is, right?

11:28.321 --> 11:31.200
He was like a father
to your father.

11:31.624 --> 11:33.103
That makes you family too.

11:36.095 --> 11:40.771
But when someone

11:40.933 --> 11:43.607
is good to you

11:43.769 --> 11:47.979
and you're not good to them back,
then bad things happen.

11:49.675 --> 11:51.279
You do very well in school.

11:51.444 --> 11:54.857
So I know this is not too
complicated for you. Am I right?

11:56.482 --> 11:59.895
Excellent. Now, your father

12:00.052 --> 12:03.397
had something
that belonged to Don Luis.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.968
IFS a small thing,
not bigger than this.

12:07.326 --> 12:09.465
Do you know where it is?

12:11.364 --> 12:13.901
Well, if you give it to me,

12:14.066 --> 12:18.674
Don Luis will be very happy
and very grateful.

12:19.639 --> 12:23.985
So why don't you just
give me that little thing

12:24.143 --> 12:26.145
which belongs to him?

12:27.246 --> 12:28.486
Would you do that?

12:29.582 --> 12:31.584
You're a smart girl,

12:31.751 --> 12:34.357
and in this life,
smart girls

12:34.520 --> 12:38.434
always get
what they want. Hm?

12:39.392 --> 12:40.769
So just tell me.

12:40.927 --> 12:42.736
Just tell me, sweetheart.

12:43.329 --> 12:44.831
What do you want?

12:47.166 --> 12:49.077
Aah!
To kill Don Luis.

12:57.410 --> 12:58.718
Get that little bitch!

13:06.886 --> 13:08.365
We need her alive!

13:23.436 --> 13:25.279
Find her! Find the little bitch!

14:16.455 --> 14:17.593
Eh?

15:15.981 --> 15:17.016
Alive.

16:39.665 --> 16:41.235
Got you.

16:42.501 --> 16:43.571
Quick!

16:44.937 --> 16:47.440
Get her! Go! Quick!

16:47.606 --> 16:48.914
Shit!

17:40.960 --> 17:42.132
Excuse me.

17:54.406 --> 17:57.319
And you say you have
something for us, sweetie?

18:00.846 --> 18:01.984
Well, may I see it?

18:11.490 --> 18:12.696
Jesus.

18:25.738 --> 18:27.183
Um...

18:47.192 --> 18:49.536
Everybody,
take a Eve-minute coffee break.

18:50.763 --> 18:52.868
Jim, we're going to
have to record this.

18:57.036 --> 19:00.210
Where did you get this, sweetie?
My papa.

19:00.372 --> 19:01.817
And where is your papa?

19:02.875 --> 19:03.876
Dead.

19:05.311 --> 19:06.881
Do you know what this is?

19:07.212 --> 19:08.885
Yes.

19:09.048 --> 19:11.551
My passport.

19:17.589 --> 19:20.593
We're about to arrive
in Miami.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.773
Let me buckle you up.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.282
Welcome to America.

19:50.089 --> 19:51.830
Go ahead. I'll wait right here.

20:11.610 --> 20:13.055
Cataleya?

20:23.155 --> 20:25.795
Hello, young lady.
Where are we wanting to go today?

20:29.228 --> 20:32.402
Chicago. It's not just
down the street, you know.

20:33.632 --> 20:34.906
How much?

21:29.588 --> 21:31.295
Hey, kid.

21:31.457 --> 21:32.868
What are you doing here?

21:56.648 --> 21:57.718
Emilio.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.592
Emilio.

22:03.822 --> 22:05.631
Emilio.

22:05.791 --> 22:07.930
There's a girl
looking for you.

22:16.568 --> 22:18.946
Her name is Cataleya.

22:45.097 --> 22:46.667
Cataleya.

23:21.500 --> 23:23.309
I thought you were dead.

23:28.807 --> 23:30.548
You're safe.

23:33.579 --> 23:36.719
It's okay. You're safe now.

23:37.382 --> 23:38.656
You're safe.

24:03.275 --> 24:07.121
--Still locked in a
bitter battle over the budget.

24:20.225 --> 24:22.205
You have

24:22.361 --> 24:26.867
your mothers beautiful eyes.

24:28.133 --> 24:30.272
Don't be afraid.

24:30.936 --> 24:33.246
This is your home.

24:40.112 --> 24:42.114
How long has it been
since you sleep?

24:42.714 --> 24:45.388
I don't know. A long time ago.

24:46.051 --> 24:49.157
Wen, good.
A young body needs to sleep.

24:49.321 --> 24:53.497
When I was your age,
I would sleep half the day.

24:53.659 --> 24:56.003
I don't know if it helped
with the growing,

24:56.161 --> 24:58.732
but I was always ready
for what came after.

25:01.800 --> 25:04.781
Whose room did I sleep in?

25:07.406 --> 25:08.908
My son.

25:09.574 --> 25:11.178
Your cousin.

25:12.778 --> 25:14.519
Where is he?

25:17.249 --> 25:18.785
He's dead.

25:21.320 --> 25:22.958
Killed?

25:25.757 --> 25:27.430
Yes.

25:28.093 --> 25:29.629
By who?

25:30.696 --> 25:33.472
No one who is still alive.

25:37.803 --> 25:39.282
You are very talented.

25:39.438 --> 25:41.679
Is this what you want to be,
an artist?

25:41.840 --> 25:44.446
I used to want to be like Xena.

25:44.876 --> 25:47.186
Warrior princess.

25:47.846 --> 25:49.519
Not anymore?

25:52.651 --> 25:54.187
Now?

25:56.788 --> 25:58.631
I wan (to be a killer.

26:02.728 --> 26:04.537
Can you help?

26:06.965 --> 26:08.638
Sure.

26:25.984 --> 26:29.659
Normally, we don't accept students
in the middle of the academic year.

26:30.222 --> 26:32.828
But under these circumstances,

26:32.991 --> 26:36.996
losing her parents
in this tragic car accident...

26:38.363 --> 26:40.775
Here you are.
These are the school supplies

26:40.932 --> 26:42.275
you will need.
- Sorry.

26:42.834 --> 26:44.905
She's a little traumatized.

26:45.070 --> 26:47.880
Of course.
We'll see you Monday, Cataleya.

26:49.408 --> 26:50.751
Such a pretty name.

27:00.085 --> 27:03.931
After we get this stuff, we'll go
to Maxwell Street to get a hot dog

27:04.089 --> 27:06.433
from the Polish people.
You like hot dogs?

27:07.292 --> 27:08.794
Hey.

27:11.029 --> 27:12.440
What is it now?

27:12.964 --> 27:15.774
That school has nothing
to teach me.

27:15.934 --> 27:17.914
I told you what I want.

27:19.237 --> 27:22.480
You don't want
to help me? Fine.

27:22.641 --> 27:24.143
I'll do it myself.

27:27.779 --> 27:29.053
Look.

27:33.885 --> 27:35.228
Stop! Run!

27:42.461 --> 27:44.134
Like that?
That's what you want?

27:44.296 --> 27:46.572
You want me to teach you
how to be a killer?

27:46.731 --> 27:48.335
No problem. I teach you.

27:48.500 --> 27:51.003
But you'll be dead in five years.

27:54.639 --> 27:58.610
If you want to be a killer and survive,
you got to be a smart one.

27:59.744 --> 28:02.350
Have to know things
besides how to pull a trigger.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.494
You have to know how people think.

28:04.649 --> 28:06.788
You got to learn how
to be psychological.

28:06.952 --> 28:10.456
I cannot teach you that unless
you learn the basics at a school.

28:10.622 --> 28:12.602
You got that? Hm?

28:13.425 --> 28:16.201
Come on, what's it going to be?
Cataleya, you choose.

28:16.661 --> 28:17.696
Come on.

28:18.997 --> 28:21.705
Now. Choose. Come on.

28:21.867 --> 28:23.813
What you want? Choose.

28:33.879 --> 28:35.153
Bette F.

29:00.972 --> 29:02.007
Hey, buddy.

29:02.507 --> 29:05.511
I got the good stuff.
So then I suggest,

29:05.677 --> 29:09.147
you know, let's buy some
things, spice it up a bit.

29:09.314 --> 29:12.693
A garter belt, some of those
stockings that come up to the thigh.

29:12.851 --> 29:14.728
Right, nice.
It's been 14 years.

29:14.886 --> 29:17.560
You know?
No matter how much I like steak,

29:17.722 --> 29:20.362
sometimes a lamb chop
isn't a bad thing, right?

29:20.525 --> 29:22.004
Exactly.

29:23.528 --> 29:24.563
Oh, my God.

29:28.333 --> 29:30.677
Son of a bitch!

29:34.239 --> 29:36.185
Fuck, man.

29:37.609 --> 29:38.917
What the--?

29:40.045 --> 29:41.547
Put your hands
on the car!

29:41.713 --> 29:44.557
Hands on the vehicle
right now. Right now.

29:45.383 --> 29:47.454
Oh, bad--

29:49.688 --> 29:54.137
You stupid crazy bitch.
I'm really sorry. This is not--

29:54.292 --> 29:56.272
it's not even my car.
- This is funny?

29:56.428 --> 29:57.532
No, sir!

30:00.265 --> 30:02.370
I'll give you something
to laugh about.

30:03.969 --> 30:06.540
I'm sor-- Officer, I'm sorry.
I don't drink.

30:16.047 --> 30:17.424
What the--?

30:27.459 --> 30:30.099
Oh, hey.
There's nothing here.

30:31.663 --> 30:36.578
No license, no registration,
no ID.

30:36.735 --> 30:39.477
Except for a library card.

30:40.438 --> 30:43.976
Miss Valerie Phillips.

30:44.142 --> 30:48.488
In addition to all that,
you are being charged with DUI,

30:48.647 --> 30:50.786
driving the wrong side
of the road,

30:50.949 --> 30:53.429
and destruction
of police property.

30:54.653 --> 30:56.496
Miss Phillips!

30:57.355 --> 31:00.029
Do I have your full attention?

31:02.260 --> 31:03.603
Yeah.

31:04.195 --> 31:05.367
That's it?

31:05.530 --> 31:08.534
Unless there's anything
else you can think of.

31:10.168 --> 31:11.670
I have to throw up.

31:11.836 --> 31:14.373
Oh, no, no, no.
Get her out of here!

31:15.774 --> 31:17.811
And a cup of coffee.
We'll book her tomorrow.

31:17.976 --> 31:20.456
Let her sleep it off,
for chrissakes.

31:30.055 --> 31:32.797
All right, big step.
Down you come.

31:32.957 --> 31:35.369
All right, stretch those legs.
Come on, move.

31:39.030 --> 31:40.509
Regis, check downstairs.

31:40.665 --> 31:43.077
She's from Roma.
And she says to the other--

31:43.234 --> 31:44.975
Excuse me.
U.S. Marshal Warren.

31:45.637 --> 31:47.913
I'm here with Gennaro Rizzo
on an overnight.

31:48.073 --> 31:50.576
Wait, hold a second.
You know, it says here

31:50.742 --> 31:54.815
you're not expected until tomorrow.
Never expect the expected, sergeant.

31:54.979 --> 31:57.550
Is that coffee there? Is that fresh?
Yes, it is.

31:57.716 --> 31:59.696
Do you mind?
Patrick.

31:59.851 --> 32:01.922
Appreciate it.
Officer Doyle

32:02.087 --> 32:04.033
is gonna show you
the Cell blocks.

32:04.189 --> 32:05.725
Oh, come on.

32:07.058 --> 32:09.163
Home, sweet home.

32:12.764 --> 32:14.437
After you, sir.

32:24.008 --> 32:25.885
I'm gonna miss you, Rizzo.

32:26.044 --> 32:27.352
I'll leave that there.

32:27.512 --> 32:29.924
Just in case you get hungry
in the night.

32:31.750 --> 32:33.127
Sleep well.

32:33.284 --> 32:36.561
Be a caffeine kind of night, Joe.
Keep your eyes open.

33:41.486 --> 33:43.762
--The count two balls and no strikes.

33:43.922 --> 33:46.869
He does have
24 home runs and...

35:15.613 --> 35:17.559
Two.

35:17.715 --> 35:18.785
One.

35:23.054 --> 35:24.089
Oh, f--

35:24.255 --> 35:25.734
Not again.

35:25.890 --> 35:28.803
Hey, Doyle, go check the
ventilation system, will you?

35:28.960 --> 35:32.134
As in today, please.
Jesus Christ.

35:43.741 --> 35:45.550
Oh, Shit.

36:30.154 --> 36:31.633
Yeah?
Yeah, I gotta pee.

37:39.524 --> 37:41.197
Unbutton your shirt.
What?

37:41.359 --> 37:42.770
Now.

37:46.030 --> 37:47.373
Who are you?

37:48.166 --> 37:50.043
Not room service.

37:57.241 --> 37:59.016
Go!
Come on!

37:59.177 --> 38:00.588
High-level security threat.

38:02.547 --> 38:03.924
- Come on!
- Move! Move!

38:05.016 --> 38:08.520
Come on, move! Get inside!
Somebody open the door!

38:16.194 --> 38:18.367
Look at me. Look at me.
Give me the gun.

38:19.063 --> 38:21.942
Just give it to me, okay?
It's okay. That's good.

38:22.700 --> 38:25.772
Move it! Hold him down!
I didn't do it!

38:26.270 --> 38:28.216
You really gotta listen to me.

38:28.372 --> 38:29.942
- You got him?
- Watch him!

38:30.108 --> 38:31.644
- Get him Out.
- I didn't do it!

38:31.809 --> 38:34.050
Get him out! Call it in.
I didn't do it!

38:34.545 --> 38:36.081
Call it in!

38:37.882 --> 38:39.225
Come on!

38:39.951 --> 38:41.897
Step aside!
- Go, go!

38:58.569 --> 39:00.242
Come on, spread out, men.

39:31.035 --> 39:32.446
There!

39:49.620 --> 39:51.964
Check out the north side.

39:55.126 --> 39:56.298
It's clear here.

40:20.851 --> 40:23.161
Okay, okay, let's go.

40:41.672 --> 40:42.742
Agent Ross.

40:42.907 --> 40:44.352
Where is he?

40:44.508 --> 40:47.546
He's in the morgue.
Let's go.

40:53.884 --> 40:56.364
This is just how he came in.

40:59.223 --> 41:01.260
It's the same handwriting.

41:04.762 --> 41:06.764
Same drawing, right?

41:06.931 --> 41:08.706
It's him.

41:09.900 --> 41:12.403
I want to see the location,
please.

41:13.137 --> 41:14.582
Thank you.

41:17.241 --> 41:19.778
- Oh, I shouldn't drink.
- No, you shouldn't.

41:19.944 --> 41:23.391
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
Yeah, you can tell that to the judge

41:23.547 --> 41:27.256
in 10 days' time at your hearing.
Oh, my God.

41:29.220 --> 41:32.133
What's going on down there?
Nothing. Sign this form.

41:32.290 --> 41:33.394
And then you can go.

41:33.557 --> 41:35.434
Really?
But I'm sure the judge

41:35.593 --> 41:38.233
will send you back here.
I probably deserve it.

41:38.396 --> 41:40.808
Yeah, well, you're just lucky
no one got hurt.

41:44.502 --> 41:46.914
Marshal. Marshal!

41:47.071 --> 41:48.744
Okay, okay, back up.

41:48.906 --> 41:50.977
Was it an assassination?

41:56.981 --> 41:58.255
You didn't lock it down.

41:58.416 --> 41:59.588
It was after the fact.

41:59.750 --> 42:01.923
I didn't think anybody--
You have to do it.

42:02.086 --> 42:05.158
Nobody in, nobody out, please.
Okay.

42:05.323 --> 42:08.361
You heard the man, lock it down.
Nobody in, nobody out.

42:08.526 --> 42:10.164
When will there be a statement?

42:11.262 --> 42:14.004
Will the commissioner hold
a press conference again?

42:14.165 --> 42:15.769
Yes or no?

42:19.437 --> 42:21.280
People need to know!

42:43.894 --> 42:47.637
I want to see paper on everybody
in and out of this station

42:47.798 --> 42:49.641
in the last 24 hours.

42:53.471 --> 42:57.817
And I want the tapes
from all the security cameras.

42:57.975 --> 42:59.352
All of them.

43:46.390 --> 43:49.200
We're good.
When you are back?

43:49.360 --> 43:51.237
The day after tomorrow.
Good.

43:51.395 --> 43:53.602
I have something for you.

43:53.764 --> 43:55.869
Give me a day.
Okay.

43:56.033 --> 43:58.206
We can't wait to see you back.

43:59.203 --> 44:02.047
Give Mama a kiss for me.
I will.

44:05.709 --> 44:07.416
Thank you.

44:08.078 --> 44:11.548
Twenty-two murders in the last
four years, all with the same MO.

44:11.715 --> 44:13.786
Rm right.
He is sending a message,

44:13.951 --> 44:16.227
but I believe
it's not meant for us.

44:16.387 --> 44:18.230
We're the ones
with the information.

44:18.389 --> 44:21.927
We're not getting anywhere with it.
Put it out to the press.

44:22.092 --> 44:26.632
Its time. The word.
This lipstick drawing.

44:26.797 --> 44:29.573
I want it splashed over
every newspaper, magazine.

44:29.733 --> 44:32.805
Front page, national.
If the message isn't meant for us,

44:32.970 --> 44:35.814
let's make sure it gets
to who it's intended for.

44:50.087 --> 44:53.261
Mr. Richard.
Hm. Marco.

44:53.424 --> 44:56.098
It's been a long time.
It has. How is the hand?

44:56.660 --> 44:59.436
It only hurts when it's humid.

44:59.597 --> 45:02.635
Let us relocate you to Arizona
instead of New Orleans.

45:02.800 --> 45:05.440
Yeah, right.
But the boss likes it humid.

45:05.603 --> 45:08.106
He's waiting for you.
Okay.

45:11.141 --> 45:14.122
What do you think? Hm?

45:14.278 --> 45:16.656
Coincidence.
Twenty-two times?

45:17.281 --> 45:19.352
Flower that only grows
in one place on earth.

45:20.384 --> 45:22.796
Uh, didn't that used to be
the calling card of...?

45:22.953 --> 45:25.126
Shoot. I forgot his name.

45:25.289 --> 45:27.132
What was his name?
Your partner?

45:27.291 --> 45:29.794
You know, the one who
used to do your wet work.

45:30.694 --> 45:32.799
Fabio.
Fabio.

45:32.963 --> 45:34.840
Fabio Mafia Restrepo.

45:34.999 --> 45:36.501
May I?

45:38.502 --> 45:41.915
The CIA is not
an amusement park.

45:42.072 --> 45:45.144
When the agency extracted you
from Colombia 15 years ago,

45:45.309 --> 45:49.155
and set you up here, we allowed you
to resume your little business.

45:49.313 --> 45:51.987
What we should've done
was lock you away for life.

45:52.149 --> 45:55.426
Now, in exchange, you should've
kept the information flowing.

45:55.586 --> 45:57.088
And I have.
Not much.

45:59.990 --> 46:03.369
I had nothing to do with this.
Then find out who did.

46:17.841 --> 46:19.878
She's talking to us.

46:20.678 --> 46:22.555
Could be anyone.

46:22.713 --> 46:24.192
Idiot.

46:24.348 --> 46:28.763
I told you, everyone dead,
down to the dog.

46:30.254 --> 46:32.427
You screwed up the first time.

46:32.590 --> 46:35.696
Now, go fix it.

47:27.745 --> 47:29.088
? Deeper down?

47:32.016 --> 47:34.155
? We're all goin' down?

47:36.153 --> 47:40.124
? Down, deeper down, yeah?

47:43.627 --> 47:47.336
? We are all plunging
Straight towards our own decline?

47:47.498 --> 47:51.469
? Without noticing
We slide down, deeper down?

47:51.635 --> 47:52.875
? Down?

47:54.605 --> 47:57.711
? Down, deeper down, yeah?

48:29.239 --> 48:32.743
Each and every one of the victims
was a professional bad apple.

48:32.910 --> 48:35.550
As for motive,
I've narrowed it down to

48:35.713 --> 48:38.922
payback, but not much else.
My best guess:

48:39.083 --> 48:40.562
Alexa Milshinova.

48:41.018 --> 48:43.692
She made a career
out of getting intimate

48:43.854 --> 48:46.494
with high-stakes gamblers
out of Vegas.

48:46.657 --> 48:50.002
She would rip them off and then
send them to meet their maker.

48:50.160 --> 48:52.834
Here, DiAngelo James.

48:52.996 --> 48:56.876
He tried to take over
the heroin trade from Houston

48:57.835 --> 49:00.008
from the Gemini cartel.

49:00.170 --> 49:03.549
If you do not know all there is
to know about these twins,

49:04.274 --> 49:06.550
you should not be in this room.

49:09.012 --> 49:11.356
You see, he tilts
the camera just enough

49:11.515 --> 49:16.021
so he won't be seen going into
the cell. The time, 1:55 a.m.

49:16.186 --> 49:19.429
That means our perp
was in that station that...

49:19.690 --> 49:22.034
I don't have to spell it out
for you, do I?

49:22.593 --> 49:24.129
Excuse me.

49:24.294 --> 49:26.240
Hand these out, please.

49:27.097 --> 49:29.703
These are names, addresses
and phone numbers

49:29.867 --> 49:35.545
of everyone with a pulse who was
in that station before 1:55 a.m.

49:35.706 --> 49:39.779
Everyone. Which means
one of them was our target.

49:39.943 --> 49:43.447
Locate the 10 people in the folder
you've just been handed.

49:43.614 --> 49:45.616
I want a detailed dossier on each

49:45.783 --> 49:48.059
for the last 10 years of their lives.

49:48.218 --> 49:51.893
I want you to run down every lead.
You will check every story.

49:52.055 --> 49:54.899
Our killer, ladies and gentlemen,
is in those folders.

49:55.058 --> 49:58.437
And I mean to catch him
before he kills again.

50:28.425 --> 50:30.132
Don't move.

50:33.997 --> 50:35.772
Hello, Jennifer.

50:36.834 --> 50:38.370
Hello, Danny.

50:48.312 --> 50:49.450
? Get so tired?

50:49.613 --> 50:51.490
You haven't finished
your painting.

50:52.316 --> 50:55.388
You never finish a painting.
You just stop working on it.

50:55.552 --> 50:57.031
I know something you finish.

50:57.187 --> 50:59.360
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

51:03.293 --> 51:06.035
? A thousand flowers?

51:06.196 --> 51:08.233
Tell me something.

51:09.733 --> 51:13.146
Will we ever go on a normal date?
What's a normal date?

51:13.303 --> 51:16.841
You know, go out, have dinner,
drink wine, get drunk.

51:17.007 --> 51:18.645
Mmm. Dessert?

51:19.576 --> 51:24.491
? Give me a reason
To love you?

51:27.818 --> 51:32.665
? Give me a reason
To want to be your man?

51:35.692 --> 51:40.368
? Give me the reason to love you?

52:29.780 --> 52:31.726
? Watch out, watch out?

52:33.951 --> 52:35.225
? Timber?

52:36.486 --> 52:38.056
Safe?

52:38.755 --> 52:41.895
From my end. You?

52:42.059 --> 52:43.561
Safe.

52:43.727 --> 52:45.229
How's Mama?

52:45.896 --> 52:48.740
She is missing you.

52:48.899 --> 52:50.401
Tell her I miss her back.

52:50.567 --> 52:53.411
I think she would love
to hear that from you.

52:53.570 --> 52:54.981
I know.

52:55.472 --> 52:57.247
What do we have?

53:00.243 --> 53:03.156
Remember the guy on the news
running a Ponzi scheme

53:03.313 --> 53:04.690
about a year ago?
Mm-hm.

53:04.848 --> 53:07.590
Made $50 million
and vanished into thin air.

53:07.751 --> 53:10.129
Clever guy. Now he's
living in the Caribbean.

53:10.287 --> 53:11.595
Oh.
Mm.

53:11.755 --> 53:14.998
So left a lot of people very upset.

53:15.158 --> 53:18.605
So we give him a break.
Permanently.

53:20.263 --> 53:21.640
Okay.

53:24.601 --> 53:25.807
There's something else.

53:31.008 --> 53:33.784
How long has this
been going on?

53:38.315 --> 53:42.957
Not long.
Newspaper says 22.

53:43.120 --> 53:45.964
Why?
You know why.

53:46.123 --> 53:47.830
Think this will
smoke Don Luis out?

53:47.991 --> 53:52.201
You think he's that stupid?
It's not just about you, okay, Cataleya?

53:52.362 --> 53:54.399
There's me, Mama, the family.

53:57.000 --> 54:00.880
Tio, please. You're clean.

54:01.038 --> 54:03.314
You book the work,
you collect the money.

54:03.473 --> 54:06.818
Oh. How nice. And I watch your back.
That's what I do.

54:06.995 --> 54:09.098
Each and every job,
I vet, I double-vet.

54:09.264 --> 54:11.676
If I give you a job,
I turn down five, 10,

54:11.833 --> 54:15.440
because I made a promise
to keep you safe.

54:15.604 --> 54:18.949
I keep you safe, Cataleya.
That is a full-time job,

54:19.107 --> 54:21.109
no matter what
you think. But this?

54:21.276 --> 54:22.778
It's not professional.

54:22.944 --> 54:26.551
I don't care about what's professional.
I'm doing this my way.

54:26.715 --> 54:28.888
That is your way?
Yeah.

54:29.051 --> 54:31.622
A Tag Killer?

54:41.163 --> 54:44.201
L should never have
let you do this.

54:44.366 --> 54:47.813
Never.
You didn't let me do anything.

54:47.969 --> 54:52.475
I chose this, remember?
I chose this.

54:52.641 --> 54:54.746
From the moment
I walked in your door,

54:54.910 --> 54:57.481
I had already made my decision.
By yourself?

54:57.646 --> 54:59.250
Yes.

55:00.482 --> 55:03.827
Not you or anybody
is going to change that.

55:07.489 --> 55:09.992
We love you, Cataleya.

55:15.030 --> 55:18.034
Then watch my back
until it's done.

55:31.379 --> 55:33.017
Cattleya.

55:33.181 --> 55:34.421
Excuse me?

55:34.583 --> 55:37.530
It's an orchid.
What? This is?

55:37.686 --> 55:41.099
Sure it is. It grows in Colombia.
How do you know that?

55:41.256 --> 55:42.860
My wife, she's Colombian.

55:44.259 --> 55:46.068
Colombia. Uh...

55:46.228 --> 55:47.935
Cattleya?
That's right.

56:01.042 --> 56:04.455
Okay. Let's try "organization"

56:06.148 --> 56:08.253
Well, shit.

56:15.824 --> 56:17.826
Hi, boys. Did you miss me?

56:19.227 --> 56:21.002
Yeah? Well, I missed you too.

56:23.165 --> 56:25.338
Hi. Come.

56:27.335 --> 56:29.315
You guys been good? Hm?

56:29.471 --> 56:30.916
All right, stay.

56:31.640 --> 56:33.483
Sirloin.

56:33.642 --> 56:36.248
Juicy. Delicious.

56:37.579 --> 56:39.422
Want one? Good.

56:47.155 --> 56:49.032
Eat.

56:57.666 --> 56:58.701
I know that song.

57:02.204 --> 57:04.013
I guess the boys
gave me away, huh?

57:04.172 --> 57:05.947
You spoil them.
I train them.

57:15.617 --> 57:17.392
? If you're on the court alone?
? Hoop dreams?

57:17.552 --> 57:19.657
? Try to give it all you got?
? Hoop dreams?

57:19.821 --> 57:21.801
? Yo, it's 10:00 in the park
Gettin' dark?

57:21.957 --> 57:24.631
? But you still gotta hit this fast shot?
? Hoop dreams?

57:24.793 --> 57:27.239
J' Yo, I got this hoop dream
Written all on my mind J'

57:27.395 --> 57:29.534
? I'm 'bout to push rocks
Orange with the black lines?

57:29.698 --> 57:32.235
? Y'all know the deal
I got dreams of dunks?

57:32.400 --> 57:33.640
Fishy, fishy.

57:33.802 --> 57:35.042
Willie!

57:35.203 --> 57:36.739
Why are they ignoring me?

57:39.140 --> 57:40.312
What?
- Baby,

57:40.475 --> 57:42.887
you put one drop of blood
in there,

57:43.044 --> 57:45.820
they'll be your biggest admirers.
Really?

57:45.981 --> 57:47.221
Oh, yeah, baby.

57:47.382 --> 57:50.488
All the way down to your clean,
stripped bones.

57:51.386 --> 57:53.730
Cool.

57:58.493 --> 58:01.667
Alejandro, you bring in
extra security for tonight.

58:01.830 --> 58:03.275
Yes, sir.
You make sure

58:03.431 --> 58:05.911
that we are shut down, tight.

58:06.067 --> 58:08.240
Yes, sir.
Take care.

58:11.907 --> 58:14.911
Girls! Come to papa, huh?

58:28.290 --> 58:30.861
There are guys in the garden
and guys out back.

58:31.026 --> 58:33.267
I want you three upstairs.
- Yes, sir.

58:33.428 --> 58:35.465
Two on the roof.

58:37.198 --> 58:38.370
Hurry!

01:00:24.139 --> 01:00:25.516
What's this?

01:00:36.885 --> 01:00:38.762
Willie, come back to bed.

01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:40.365
Shh.

01:01:20.695 --> 01:01:22.265
What the fuck is it?

01:01:43.618 --> 01:01:45.154
Turn around.

01:01:55.830 --> 01:01:58.071
Who are you?
It doesn't matter who I am.

01:02:04.339 --> 01:02:06.080
Okay, what do you want?

01:02:06.241 --> 01:02:08.016
I want you exactly where you are.

01:02:14.582 --> 01:02:17.188
Whatever they're paying,
I'll double ii.

01:02:17.352 --> 01:02:20.595
Please, please don't kill me.
I'm not gonna kill you.

01:02:20.755 --> 01:02:21.756
Eh--? Wha--?

01:02:24.025 --> 01:02:25.333
Oh.

01:02:25.493 --> 01:02:26.870
Oh, no, no. Please.

01:02:32.767 --> 01:02:34.440
Oh, no!

01:02:57.125 --> 01:02:58.627
Yeah?
- Mn Steven Richard?

01:02:58.793 --> 01:02:59.897
Who is this?

01:03:00.061 --> 01:03:01.904
This is FBI Special Agent Ross.

01:03:02.063 --> 01:03:04.839
Look, I'm lead agent on a case.
It's a serial

01:03:04.999 --> 01:03:07.878
we call the Tag Killer.
You might have heard of him.

01:03:08.036 --> 01:03:09.743
I've seen the publicity.

01:03:09.904 --> 01:03:12.851
He marks his victims with a flower.
It's from Colombia.

01:03:13.675 --> 01:03:16.918
The Cattleya orchid.
Each time I try to access information,

01:03:17.078 --> 01:03:20.059
I get stuck with a CIA
"access denied" tag.

01:03:20.215 --> 01:03:23.992
I'm at the end of a long road,
Mr. Richard. I've been led to believe

01:03:24.152 --> 01:03:27.156
that you are the man--
Listen, Agent Ross.

01:03:27.322 --> 01:03:29.996
I can’t give any information
out over the phone.

01:03:30.158 --> 01:03:33.002
I suggest you file a formal request
with the agency

01:03:33.161 --> 01:03:36.165
for any information you might want.
I'll be happy

01:03:36.331 --> 01:03:38.834
to get back to you
as soon as I can.

01:03:41.202 --> 01:03:42.840
Thank you.

01:03:53.281 --> 01:03:55.625
Hello.
Stop bullshitting me, Marco!

01:03:55.783 --> 01:03:57.956
I got the FBI on my ass now.

01:03:58.119 --> 01:04:00.065
I want that problem taken care of

01:04:00.221 --> 01:04:02.861
Do you hear me?
Loud and clear.

01:04:03.024 --> 01:04:04.230
Good.

01:04:04.392 --> 01:04:07.236
Keep your
baggage with you at all times.

01:04:10.798 --> 01:04:11.970
Where to?

01:04:12.133 --> 01:04:15.706
Downtown. And we question
every Colombian we meet

01:04:15.870 --> 01:04:19.044
until we find an address
to get her family, okay?

01:04:44.565 --> 01:04:48.172
Jen, in case you show
up, I wanted to let you know

01:04:48.336 --> 01:04:52.478
that I went to New York to meet
with galleries. I'll be back tomorrow,

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:55.951
but if you're already here,
make yourself at home.

01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:23.505
What do we got?

01:05:23.671 --> 01:05:27.050
We do have the surveillance
tapes from a few angles.

01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:33.625
That's it?
That's it.

01:05:33.781 --> 01:05:35.624
It's not a lot to go on.
Come on.

01:05:35.783 --> 01:05:38.161
Run it through the database,
see what happens.

01:05:51.466 --> 01:05:55.175
We're not looking for a woman.
It's not possible.

01:06:13.154 --> 01:06:14.531
Wow.

01:06:15.523 --> 01:06:18.527
Wine?
Thank you.

01:06:21.262 --> 01:06:23.003
Come.
I'm impressed.

01:06:27.835 --> 01:06:29.280
I got you something.

01:06:29.437 --> 01:06:31.178
You did?
Yeah.

01:06:36.411 --> 01:06:37.947
A stuffed alligator?
Yeah.

01:06:38.112 --> 01:06:40.023
Exactly what
I've always wanted.

01:06:45.787 --> 01:06:48.631
Hey, Wait. Wait, wait.

01:06:50.391 --> 01:06:52.302
Let's just, uh...

01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:55.703
Let's just sit, have this food
and talk for a bit first.

01:06:57.532 --> 01:06:59.205
What do you want to talk about?

01:07:00.701 --> 01:07:02.703
I don't know. Anything.

01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:04.372
Ask me something.

01:07:07.208 --> 01:07:08.380
How was your trip?

01:07:08.543 --> 01:07:10.887
It was great. The gallery
liked my paintings.

01:07:11.045 --> 01:07:13.389
They're gonna put up a show.
That's good.

01:07:13.548 --> 01:07:15.050
Right?
Yeah.

01:07:16.117 --> 01:07:17.255
My turn.

01:07:17.418 --> 01:07:19.398
How was your trip?

01:07:21.722 --> 01:07:24.566
Hot.
Did you do anything exciting?

01:07:24.725 --> 01:07:27.934
I went swimming.
Anything else?

01:07:31.165 --> 01:07:33.076
Come on, talk to me.

01:07:33.234 --> 01:07:35.180
What do you want to know?
Anything.

01:07:35.336 --> 01:07:37.338
Something about you.

01:07:37.505 --> 01:07:39.246
Something.

01:07:40.308 --> 01:07:42.413
Where are you from?

01:07:44.312 --> 01:07:46.622
Are your parents
from here in the city?

01:07:52.653 --> 01:07:55.657
Okay. Let's start with something
a little more simple.

01:07:55.823 --> 01:07:57.803
What do you like
to eat for breakfast?

01:07:57.959 --> 01:07:59.802
I don't eat breakfast.

01:08:01.162 --> 01:08:03.142
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:08:03.297 --> 01:08:05.299
I want to know
a little bit about you.

01:08:05.466 --> 01:08:08.447
About what you feel, what you
feel about me. Anything.

01:08:08.603 --> 01:08:10.605
Just a little.

01:08:21.716 --> 01:08:24.196
I feel lonely sometimes.

01:08:26.287 --> 01:08:27.788
Thank you.

01:08:27.955 --> 01:08:29.524
Me too.

01:08:51.578 --> 01:08:53.490
Let me this time.

01:09:38.125 --> 01:09:39.968
Morning.

01:09:42.430 --> 01:09:45.240
You say you don't eat breakfast,
So I thought I'd make lunch.

01:09:45.399 --> 01:09:48.642
Oh, my God. Oh, shit.
Wait. Where you going?

01:09:48.803 --> 01:09:51.305
I shouldn't have done this.
Done what?

01:09:51.471 --> 01:09:53.542
Any of it!
I don't understand. Why?

01:09:54.108 --> 01:09:56.384
What are you talking about? Why?
Because.

01:09:56.544 --> 01:09:59.218
Can you just hold on?
Can we just talk about this?

01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:01.883
No, no, Danny.
We've talked too much.

01:10:02.049 --> 01:10:05.895
Jennifer, just stay for a minute.
I'm sorry, I have to go.

01:10:06.053 --> 01:10:07.760
Jennifer!

01:10:19.166 --> 01:10:20.975
I'm sorry I'm late.

01:10:26.307 --> 01:10:28.753
Eight people
slaughtered in Miami.

01:10:28.909 --> 01:10:30.411
One of them is my friend.

01:10:30.578 --> 01:10:31.579
So what?

01:10:31.746 --> 01:10:32.918
You know exactly what.

01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:34.423
He's getting too close.

01:10:34.582 --> 01:10:36.289
Please, again with that?

01:10:36.450 --> 01:10:40.193
They're looking for you,
so don't play with me.

01:10:41.756 --> 01:10:43.326
You're bringing them to you.

01:10:43.491 --> 01:10:46.301
I know how your twisted
little mind works.

01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:50.306
Think this is a game?
I'm a fucking joke to you?

01:10:51.832 --> 01:10:53.140
Hm?

01:10:53.968 --> 01:10:56.642
You scare me, Cataleya.

01:10:56.804 --> 01:10:59.284
I don't want to deal
with your shit anymore.

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:02.785
I don't want to give you work
or anything anymore.

01:11:03.611 --> 01:11:05.682
YOU are retired.

01:11:05.946 --> 01:11:08.449
You can't do that.
Lunatic!

01:11:09.684 --> 01:11:12.221
How many people did you
kill when your boy died?

01:11:17.625 --> 01:11:20.231
What you know about my son?

01:11:20.628 --> 01:11:23.472
You know fucking nothing
about my son.

01:11:26.233 --> 01:11:28.304
Bur it changed nothing.

01:11:29.503 --> 01:11:32.006
When I lose my son,
I lose my life.

01:11:32.173 --> 01:11:35.177
Everything that's important
to me is gone.

01:11:35.976 --> 01:11:38.422
But I want to believe
in you, Cataleya.

01:11:38.579 --> 01:11:43.494
Why? I still pray that you
find a life away from this,

01:11:43.651 --> 01:11:48.327
because no one in our entire family
has a chance for one.

01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:57.506
Listen. Never come to the house,
never come to the church.

01:11:57.665 --> 01:11:59.008
Don't bother.

01:11:59.166 --> 01:12:01.703
I don't want to wait for
your phone call no more.

01:12:01.869 --> 01:12:04.941
I don't want you to break
my mother's heart.

01:12:05.106 --> 01:12:07.518
Maybe this

01:12:07.675 --> 01:12:11.851
will help you to understand
what I try to tell you.

01:12:40.441 --> 01:12:44.048
Five-six, brown eyes--
Well, hazel, actually.

01:12:44.912 --> 01:12:47.722
Dark hair, thick. Shiny.

01:12:47.882 --> 01:12:50.385
Incredible body, killer Smile.

01:12:50.551 --> 01:12:54.055
I think about her all day long.
Dude, you're in love.

01:12:55.389 --> 01:12:57.892
You're so smart.
Seriously, and I mean this

01:12:58.058 --> 01:13:00.732
from the bottom of my heart,
you're nuts.

01:13:00.895 --> 01:13:03.569
I haven't had anyone
in my life for 10 years.

01:13:03.731 --> 01:13:05.802
I finally meet someone
that I really like.

01:13:05.966 --> 01:13:08.242
That I want to be with
all the time.

01:13:08.402 --> 01:13:11.281
I've got nothing.
A stuffed animal and a picture.

01:13:12.339 --> 01:13:14.751
You got a picture? Give it up.

01:13:14.909 --> 01:13:16.582
It's not even a whole picture.

01:13:16.744 --> 01:13:18.849
I took it of her
while she was sleeping.

01:13:20.681 --> 01:13:22.092
Oh, my God!
Jesus, relax.

01:13:22.249 --> 01:13:24.251
When do I meet
the future Mrs. Delaney?

01:13:24.418 --> 01:13:25.761
You? Never.

01:13:27.188 --> 01:13:29.930
Oh, shit.
Ha, ha.

01:13:30.090 --> 01:13:32.696
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Why are you writing a ticket?

01:13:41.035 --> 01:13:43.276
Third Precinct.
- Hey, Shari.

01:13:43.437 --> 01:13:44.609
You got that picture?

01:13:46.774 --> 01:13:49.653
Hello, skinny face
lying on my computer.

01:13:49.810 --> 01:13:52.620
Ooh. She's beautiful.
Clearly out of your league.

01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:55.954
It's not for me, it's for Danny.
Remember the painter?

01:13:56.116 --> 01:13:58.289
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Much better match.

01:13:58.452 --> 01:13:59.988
How long's this gonna take?

01:14:00.154 --> 01:14:02.964
Slow your roll.
You're my brother-in-law, not my boss.

01:14:03.123 --> 01:14:06.468
I'm not supposed to do this.
Shari, you are gonna be

01:14:06.627 --> 01:14:10.006
the fairy godmother in the most
beautiful love story ever.

01:14:10.164 --> 01:14:11.802
Okay? Think about it.

01:14:11.966 --> 01:14:15.175
You get the honor of saying you
made this all happen.

01:14:15.336 --> 01:14:18.510
And I get to lose my job
if I get caught.

01:14:22.343 --> 01:14:24.323
Done. I'll call when
I got something.

01:14:24.979 --> 01:14:26.481
Thank you, baby.

01:14:34.088 --> 01:14:36.159
He'll thank me later.

01:14:47.067 --> 01:14:49.513
I want a trace put on
an incoming transmission.

01:15:05.519 --> 01:15:08.398
Chicago, Third Precinct.
Get somebody down there now.

01:15:53.133 --> 01:15:55.340
That was such a nice surprise.

01:15:56.904 --> 01:15:58.906
Everyone grows up sometime.

01:15:59.073 --> 01:16:00.245
She's gonna be okay.

01:16:02.176 --> 01:16:05.180
Yes, Mama. I think so.

01:16:22.663 --> 01:16:25.303
Um, excuse me.
- Come with me, please.

01:16:25.466 --> 01:16:26.968
That's my computer.
Why--?

01:16:27.134 --> 01:16:29.444
Why are you on my computer?
- Remain silent.

01:16:29.603 --> 01:16:31.674
You better not
mess up my favorites.

01:16:31.939 --> 01:16:35.148
We need a common base,
so let's try his eyes.

01:16:35.309 --> 01:16:38.449
Good. Now, let's see hands.

01:16:40.547 --> 01:16:42.322
Looking good. And now...

01:16:45.285 --> 01:16:46.889
Hm. Nice nose.

01:16:48.322 --> 01:16:51.633
Congratulations.
You have a girl.

01:16:51.792 --> 01:16:54.966
Print it. Get it out to all stations.

01:16:55.129 --> 01:16:56.699
And get the mobile unit ready.

01:16:56.864 --> 01:16:58.309
Yes, Sir.

01:17:25.993 --> 01:17:28.269
Hello?
It's me.

01:17:28.429 --> 01:17:31.171
Jen?
Are you busy?

01:17:31.331 --> 01:17:33.242
No. No, I'm not.

01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:35.004
Danny Delaney.

01:17:35.169 --> 01:17:37.274
Localization in progress.

01:17:37.438 --> 01:17:39.349
I was just

01:17:39.506 --> 01:17:41.679
looking out the window
and thinking.

01:17:41.842 --> 01:17:43.685
Where are you?
I'm-- I'm at home.

01:17:43.844 --> 01:17:46.222
Looking out the window too.
We're looking

01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:48.291
at the same sky now?
Almost.

01:17:48.449 --> 01:17:50.451
You have a sexy voice
on the phone.

01:17:50.617 --> 01:17:52.528
Yeah, you do too.

01:17:52.686 --> 01:17:54.029
Progress. We've got it.

01:17:54.188 --> 01:17:55.531
There it is.
We got it.

01:17:55.689 --> 01:17:57.896
Give SWAT the location.

01:17:58.892 --> 01:18:00.200
Let's go!

01:18:02.863 --> 01:18:05.036
I'm really glad you called me.
Me too.

01:18:05.199 --> 01:18:07.702
I was just looking
at a picture of you

01:18:07.868 --> 01:18:09.779
when the phone rang.
Picture?

01:18:09.937 --> 01:18:12.577
I took a picture of you sleeping
with my phone.

01:18:12.739 --> 01:18:16.482
But I just wanted to have
something to remind me of you.

01:18:16.910 --> 01:18:20.380
Did you show it to anybody?
No. Well, actually, my friend Ryan.

01:18:20.547 --> 01:18:23.551
Who else saw the picture?
- Nobody. Why?

01:18:25.385 --> 01:18:26.386
Danny, who else?

01:18:26.553 --> 01:18:29.557
I didn't show it to anybody.
What's the big deal?

01:18:34.895 --> 01:18:37.466
I just took a picture
with my phone. I'm sorry.

01:18:37.631 --> 01:18:40.407
I'm sorry too. Oh, fuck.

01:18:58.118 --> 01:18:59.256
See what we got.

01:18:59.419 --> 01:19:01.763
Special Agent Williams. FBI.

01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:07.366
It's clear.

01:19:47.134 --> 01:19:48.738
Shh. Unh.

01:19:48.902 --> 01:19:52.645
I mean, I really think, like,
he was publicly humiliated...

01:19:59.012 --> 01:20:00.355
Everything's under control.

01:20:00.514 --> 01:20:01.891
I need you to come with us.

01:20:02.049 --> 01:20:03.824
We're evacuating the building.

01:20:08.322 --> 01:20:09.824
Copy. Ten-four.

01:20:17.864 --> 01:20:19.002
Charges.

01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:41.700
Blow it.

01:21:14.454 --> 01:21:18.231
No, she's not here.
Lock down this building ASAP.

01:21:48.121 --> 01:21:49.759
Anything?
No, nothing.

01:21:53.193 --> 01:21:55.696
No, wait, wait, wait.
One security camera down.

01:21:56.763 --> 01:21:57.935
Second down.
Where?

01:21:58.098 --> 01:22:00.305
The garage!
All units, get to the garage.

01:22:00.467 --> 01:22:02.970
Let's go. Let's go.
Cover all the damn exits.

01:22:39.973 --> 01:22:41.577
She's here!

01:22:43.310 --> 01:22:44.482
Look everywhere!

01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:48.824
Under every oar.
Look in every boot.

01:22:48.982 --> 01:22:51.656
She's here. Find her!

01:22:54.654 --> 01:22:57.362
Anything? Come on.
Check that boot. In here.

01:23:30.223 --> 01:23:31.725
Mama.

01:23:56.316 --> 01:23:58.922
Mama!

01:24:06.893 --> 01:24:10.340
Emilio! Emilio!

01:24:42.863 --> 01:24:45.309
I'm sorry.

01:25:01.982 --> 01:25:03.461
Thank you.

01:25:30.577 --> 01:25:33.888
This won't take long.
Please, sit.

01:25:34.047 --> 01:25:35.526
You think
you've been smart.

01:25:36.416 --> 01:25:38.589
Have you covered
all your bases?

01:25:38.752 --> 01:25:41.665
Because this?
This is already over.

01:25:41.821 --> 01:25:44.028
This whole place
is wired with webcams.

01:25:44.190 --> 01:25:45.999
You mean these?

01:25:47.327 --> 01:25:49.170
Talk about covering
all my bases.

01:25:49.329 --> 01:25:52.208
Your chair is pressure-wired.
You move a single inch,

01:25:52.365 --> 01:25:54.504
it'll be the last move
you ever make.

01:25:54.668 --> 01:25:56.773
And given what you
know about me,

01:25:56.937 --> 01:25:58.883
you know I don't bluff.

01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:06.388
I don't know about you.

01:26:06.546 --> 01:26:08.025
So I'm just gonna ask.

01:26:08.181 --> 01:26:11.185
What happened to you
that you could kill 23 people?

01:26:11.351 --> 01:26:16.596
Would you believe me if I told you
this wasn't the life I had imagined

01:26:16.756 --> 01:26:18.963
when I was a child?

01:26:19.125 --> 01:26:22.265
I wanted to be like you,
on the other side.

01:26:22.429 --> 01:26:26.707
Really? So, what happened?

01:26:31.705 --> 01:26:33.207
Luis Sandoval.

01:26:33.940 --> 01:26:37.581
I was 9
when he had my parents killed

01:26:37.744 --> 01:26:40.315
in front of me.

01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:42.221
So all this?

01:26:42.782 --> 01:26:44.386
The rag Killing, the clues

01:26:45.251 --> 01:26:47.561
weren't for us at all.
It was all for him?

01:26:47.721 --> 01:26:49.257
Only way to track him down.

01:26:49.422 --> 01:26:51.732
You needed us
to put it all in the press?

01:26:51.891 --> 01:26:54.804
Yes, but it took you
so fucking long.

01:26:54.961 --> 01:26:57.601
Goddamn. You've had
to be really determined.

01:26:57.764 --> 01:27:01.678
Very focused, huh?
Not focused enough.

01:27:06.006 --> 01:27:10.421
This morning he took
the last piece of me.

01:27:10.577 --> 01:27:13.683
You sent the man a message,
he sent you one right back.

01:27:13.847 --> 01:27:16.088
And now
I'm gonna finish it.

01:27:16.249 --> 01:27:18.195
Oh, I can't help you.

01:27:18.351 --> 01:27:20.422
Yes, he's protected
by your government.

01:27:20.587 --> 01:27:23.625
By a part of my government
that I cannot reach.

01:27:23.790 --> 01:27:26.771
It's CIA, and I don't know why,
but I can't get under it.

01:27:26.926 --> 01:27:30.271
I can't get over it, and you have
to believe me, I have tried.

01:27:30.430 --> 01:27:32.205
Try harder, Agent Ross.

01:27:37.337 --> 01:27:39.112
You have a beautiful family.

01:27:39.272 --> 01:27:41.718
You go anywhere near my family,
and I swear to God, I will--

01:27:41.875 --> 01:27:43.115
Shh.

01:27:48.181 --> 01:27:49.990
Now you know
what you have to do.

01:27:50.150 --> 01:27:51.959
Get me Luis Sandoval.

01:27:52.118 --> 01:27:54.325
Because if you don't,

01:27:54.487 --> 01:27:58.025
you're going to go
to a funeral every week,

01:27:58.958 --> 01:28:01.632
and I will not stop
until you begin to feel

01:28:01.795 --> 01:28:03.638
what I felt all these years.

01:28:03.797 --> 01:28:05.504
I'm sorry.

01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:08.245
Cataleya.

01:28:11.971 --> 01:28:14.349
When your dinner's ready,

01:28:14.507 --> 01:28:16.851
the timer in your chair
will have expired.

01:28:17.977 --> 01:28:19.820
Don't get up before.

01:28:22.148 --> 01:28:23.388
Hey!

01:28:37.197 --> 01:28:40.007
You do understand
that I only took this meeting

01:28:40.166 --> 01:28:41.941
out of professional courtesy.

01:28:42.102 --> 01:28:44.844
NOW, the truth is,
I really can't help you at all.

01:28:45.004 --> 01:28:47.848
Can't or won't?
It's the same thing, really.

01:28:48.007 --> 01:28:50.851
But in the spirit
of reaching out,

01:28:52.378 --> 01:28:54.688
let me put my cards on the table.
Yeah?

01:28:54.848 --> 01:28:56.350
I have met this woman,

01:28:56.516 --> 01:28:58.894
this Tag Killer.
It's a woman?

01:28:59.052 --> 01:29:00.360
Yeah.
Is she pretty?

01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:02.966
She got the drop on me
in my home, told me

01:29:03.123 --> 01:29:06.195
that if I don't bring her
the whereabouts of this man,

01:29:06.359 --> 01:29:09.067
she's going to kill
a member of my family

01:29:09.229 --> 01:29:12.369
every week until I have none left.
Are you kidding me?

01:29:12.532 --> 01:29:15.706
Does it seem to you that I would
make something like this up?

01:29:15.869 --> 01:29:19.715
So why don't you just
tell me what I should do?

01:29:20.373 --> 01:29:21.545
Call 911.

01:29:21.708 --> 01:29:24.211
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a meeting.

01:29:24.377 --> 01:29:26.220
It starts now.

01:29:33.219 --> 01:29:34.664
Ross.

01:29:42.162 --> 01:29:45.234
It's her. If you don't give her
what she wants,

01:29:45.398 --> 01:29:49.312
she's going to redecorate
your whole office. With you.

01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:56.582
Can you tell her that glass
is tempered to resist

01:29:56.743 --> 01:29:59.656
a direct hit
by a 57 mm ordinance?

01:30:12.025 --> 01:30:14.096
Ten seconds
to give up that address.

01:30:14.260 --> 01:30:16.206
How can I be sure
she won't kill me?

01:30:16.362 --> 01:30:18.603
She says you can't,
but you can trust me.

01:30:18.765 --> 01:30:22.508
If you don't give her what she wants,
you will be her 24th victim.

01:30:22.669 --> 01:30:25.377
Eight-six-seven Magnolia Terrace,
New Orleans.

01:30:25.538 --> 01:30:28.519
She asked that you keep
this conversation confidential.

01:30:28.675 --> 01:30:30.154
With pleasure.

01:30:30.310 --> 01:30:32.221
What about my family?

01:31:43.683 --> 01:31:45.856
Good morning. Who are you?

01:31:46.019 --> 01:31:47.259
That's not important.

01:31:47.420 --> 01:31:49.957
What's important is,
I need the floor plans

01:31:50.123 --> 01:31:53.730
to 867 Magnolia Terrace.
If you don't leave immediately,

01:31:53.893 --> 01:31:55.702
I will call the police.

01:31:56.362 --> 01:31:59.036
I really need those floor plans.

01:32:01.935 --> 01:32:06.748
You will take positions
here, here and here.

01:32:06.906 --> 01:32:09.785
You must expect
the unexpected.

01:32:09.943 --> 01:32:13.390
She's like mist under a door,
like a mouse in the wall.

01:32:13.546 --> 01:32:15.492
She will never attack straight on,

01:32:15.648 --> 01:32:18.561
and you will not see her
until it's too late.

01:32:18.718 --> 01:32:21.756
She's that invisible.

01:32:25.992 --> 01:32:27.266
Shit! Marco!

01:32:54.420 --> 01:32:56.525
Don Luis.

01:32:56.689 --> 01:32:58.600
Don Luis, are you okay?

01:33:00.026 --> 01:33:02.097
Get the Mercedes!

01:33:02.261 --> 01:33:04.104
What happened?
We need to get out.

01:33:04.263 --> 01:33:06.436
Leave me alone!
- Come on!

01:33:06.599 --> 01:33:08.306
Come on, come on!

01:33:09.369 --> 01:33:10.780
Everyone in!

01:33:43.469 --> 01:33:45.176
We have to move.

01:33:45.338 --> 01:33:47.011
Quick! Let's go!
Hurry up.

01:33:47.173 --> 01:33:48.311
Come on.

01:33:49.075 --> 01:33:51.316
You hide here.

01:33:51.844 --> 01:33:53.187
Wait for my call.
- Okay.

01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:09.271
Come on! Find her!

01:34:09.429 --> 01:34:12.501
And look everywhere!

01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:56.142
Hello.
- Did you catch her?

01:34:56.309 --> 01:34:57.811
We're checking it.

01:35:14.393 --> 01:35:15.463
I think we got her.

01:35:21.901 --> 01:35:23.642
Marco! Marco!

01:36:11.117 --> 01:36:12.687
Marco!

01:36:28.801 --> 01:36:30.303
What the hell is going on?

01:36:30.469 --> 01:36:32.642
I will hold here.
Marco!

01:37:01.901 --> 01:37:05.178
You've been waiting for this
moment for a long time, right?

01:37:05.338 --> 01:37:06.578
Yes.

01:40:05.684 --> 01:40:07.129
Marco?

01:40:07.286 --> 01:40:08.924
CATALEYA I
No.

01:40:09.388 --> 01:40:11.129
It's Cataleya.

01:40:11.290 --> 01:40:12.894
What were you expecting?

01:40:13.058 --> 01:40:15.698
You have ruined
your whole life trying to kill me.

01:40:15.861 --> 01:40:17.033
Someone like me?

01:40:17.263 --> 01:40:20.142
I cannot be killed. I do the killing.

01:40:20.299 --> 01:40:22.905
And now it's your tum to be hunted.

01:40:23.102 --> 01:40:24.911
You will never find me.

01:40:25.237 --> 01:40:28.081
But as day follows night,
believe me,

01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:31.619
I'll find you, and I will kill you!
And you know why?

01:40:31.777 --> 01:40:35.384
Because I will never be
where you want me to be.

01:40:36.215 --> 01:40:37.956
Actually...

01:40:39.952 --> 01:40:42.432
you're exactly where
I want you to be.

01:40:42.588 --> 01:40:43.589
Huh?

01:40:47.159 --> 01:40:49.332
Aah!
Eat.

01:41:17.156 --> 01:41:19.466
You should think very carefully.

01:41:20.092 --> 01:41:23.164
Is there anything else?
I've already told you everything.

01:41:23.329 --> 01:41:26.333
She'd come by for a couple of hours,
then she'd leave.

01:41:26.499 --> 01:41:29.503
It's late, I'm tired.
If you are not gonna arrest me...

01:41:29.668 --> 01:41:32.649
We don't actually have
anything to charge you with.

01:41:33.272 --> 01:41:35.274
So can I leave?
No.

01:41:35.441 --> 01:41:37.284
I got a few more
questions.

01:41:38.444 --> 01:41:42.358
Can I at least get a cup of coffee?
Yeah.

01:41:44.350 --> 01:41:45.385
Cream and sugar?

01:41:45.551 --> 01:41:47.531
Yes, please.

01:41:54.159 --> 01:41:56.662
Hello?
Hello?

01:41:56.829 --> 01:41:59.810
Jen. Thank God.
Look, I had no idea.

01:41:59.965 --> 01:42:02.377
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

01:42:02.535 --> 01:42:04.674
I'm fine.

01:42:04.837 --> 01:42:07.317
Where are you?
FBI.

01:42:07.473 --> 01:42:11.421
Danny, you know that they--
Yeah.

01:42:11.577 --> 01:42:13.716
How much time do we have?

01:42:13.879 --> 01:42:15.859
Forty seconds.

01:42:16.015 --> 01:42:20.486
Use this time for three questions.
What's your real name?

01:42:22.488 --> 01:42:24.365
Cataleya.

01:42:24.523 --> 01:42:26.366
Like the flower?

01:42:27.526 --> 01:42:30.166
Yes. Like the flower.

01:42:30.329 --> 01:42:31.774
Twenty-two seconds.

01:42:31.931 --> 01:42:35.105
Will my little bird
come back one day?

01:42:37.336 --> 01:42:40.078
Leave your window open
and you'll see.

01:42:41.607 --> 01:42:42.915
Hey, Ross!
Yeah?

01:42:43.075 --> 01:42:45.578
We're picking something up
off that guy's phone.

01:42:46.211 --> 01:42:48.088
Last question.

01:42:48.881 --> 01:42:50.519
I love you.

01:42:53.686 --> 01:42:57.634
Give me that phone.
Give it. Hello?

01:42:58.023 --> 01:42:59.764
Hello?

01:43:19.144 --> 01:43:20.885
You can go.

01:43:39.765 --> 01:43:43.338
# I hurt myself today#

01:43:45.471 --> 01:43:49.248
# To see if I still feel#

01:43:50.576 --> 01:43:54.683
# I focus on the pain#

01:43:56.081 --> 01:44:00.086
# The only thing that's real#

01:44:01.286 --> 01:44:05.098
# The needle tears a hole#

01:44:06.759 --> 01:44:10.468
# The old familiar sting#

01:44:11.463 --> 01:44:16.139
# Try to kill it all away#

01:44:16.635 --> 01:44:21.345
# But I remember everything#

01:44:22.941 --> 01:44:26.286
# What have I become#

01:44:28.714 --> 01:44:31.627
# My sweetest friend#

01:44:33.452 --> 01:44:36.956
# Everyone I know#

01:44:37.456 --> 01:44:42.405
# Goes away in the end#

01:44:43.662 --> 01:44:47.804
# And you could have it all#

01:44:49.301 --> 01:44:52.839
# My empire of dirt#

01:44:54.540 --> 01:44:57.987
# I will let you down#

01:44:59.678 --> 01:45:03.490
# I will make you hurt#

01:45:14.893 --> 01:45:19.569
# I wear this crown of thorns#

01:45:20.566 --> 01:45:24.514
# Upon my liar's chair#

01:45:26.171 --> 01:45:29.675
# Full of broken thoughts#

01:45:31.510 --> 01:45:35.253
# I cannot repair#

01:45:36.348 --> 01:45:40.353
# Beneath the stains of time#

01:45:41.754 --> 01:45:45.395
# The feelings disappear#

01:45:47.259 --> 01:45:50.934
# You are someone else#

01:45:52.698 --> 01:45:56.202
# I am still right here#

01:45:57.970 --> 01:46:01.315
# What have I become#

01:46:03.876 --> 01:46:06.823
# My sweetest friend#

01:46:08.547 --> 01:46:11.824
# Everyone I know#

01:46:12.551 --> 01:46:17.261
# Goes away in the end#

01:46:18.757 --> 01:46:22.330
# And you could have it all#

01:46:24.329 --> 01:46:27.776
# My empire of dirt#

01:46:29.635 --> 01:46:33.082
# I will let you down#

01:46:34.807 --> 01:46:38.118
# I will make you hurt#

01:46:39.678 --> 01:46:43.524
# If I could start again#

01:46:44.917 --> 01:46:48.592
# A million miles away#

01:46:50.355 --> 01:46:53.598
# I would keep myself#

01:46:55.494 --> 01:47:00.534
# I would find a way#

01:47:01.305 --> 01:47:07.580
