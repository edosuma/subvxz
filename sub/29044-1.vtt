00:02.602 --> 00:04.670
(glass breaking)

00:10.478 --> 00:13.879
(upbeat dramatic music)

00:35.469 --> 00:39.038
(police radio chattering)

00:45.980 --> 00:48.847
(woman screaming)

00:50.718 --> 00:52.584
(body thudding)

00:52.586 --> 00:54.019
(man grunting)

00:54.021 --> 00:56.722
(woman gasping)

01:00.327 --> 01:03.195
(woman screaming)

01:12.740 --> 01:15.374
(woman crying)

01:28.355 --> 01:32.491
- Just stick out your
tongue and say ah,

01:34.028 --> 01:35.260
like you at the doctor.

01:36.363 --> 01:41.133
(woman screaming)
(train horn blowing)

01:43.270 --> 01:46.839
Oh no. (chuckling)

01:46.841 --> 01:48.807
(man groaning)

01:48.809 --> 01:53.846
(woman screaming)
(train horn blowing)

01:59.920 --> 02:03.455
(police radio chattering)

02:07.928 --> 02:09.794
- [Irene] There's
no real good word

02:09.797 --> 02:11.697
for what me and my mom do.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.266
(ladies laughing)

02:14.268 --> 02:17.202
You could say that
we're lady pimps,

02:18.806 --> 02:23.509
pimpstresses,
abadessas, or madams.

02:29.650 --> 02:32.918
My mom says that we're just as
important as the government.

02:34.188 --> 02:38.357
Without us the whole
city wouldn't function.

02:38.359 --> 02:40.359
The economy would collapse

02:40.361 --> 02:42.394
and the streets
would run with blood.

02:44.498 --> 02:47.299
(dramatic music)

02:57.011 --> 02:59.578
- Can you grab my phone
and take some pictures?

02:59.580 --> 03:02.681
It'll be cool to post
this later. (chuckles)

03:02.683 --> 03:03.515
(phone beeping)

03:03.517 --> 03:06.485
(shutter clicking)

03:11.592 --> 03:14.226
(upbeat music)

03:15.930 --> 03:18.664
(horns honking)

03:21.569 --> 03:26.638
(upbeat music)
(pool balls crashing)

03:36.617 --> 03:39.818
(dramatic music)

03:39.820 --> 03:42.187
- [Gaven] Night clubbing again.

03:42.189 --> 03:45.290
Fuck, I'm just night
clubbing again.

03:47.228 --> 03:50.095
When I was sober I
wanted to be drunk.

03:51.298 --> 03:53.298
Now that I'm drinking,

03:55.603 --> 03:57.336
all I want is to be sober.

04:00.507 --> 04:01.512
- Blue Sky.

04:03.577 --> 04:06.678
- But there's four of
them and only two of us.

04:08.983 --> 04:10.249
We're stocked to Karate.

04:12.152 --> 04:16.221
- Karate got run over by a
truck last month remember?

04:16.223 --> 04:17.223
- I'm sorry man.

04:20.327 --> 04:21.726
- Leaves no choice.

04:22.830 --> 04:26.865
- I'll attack first,
you clean up the mess.

04:37.511 --> 04:41.446
Hey Joey, making money tonight?

04:43.684 --> 04:45.183
- Don't touch my beer.

04:45.185 --> 04:47.853
(man laughing)

04:50.758 --> 04:51.690
(spitting loudly)

04:51.692 --> 04:52.891
- [Joey] Oh my god, fuck!

04:52.893 --> 04:53.892
(men yelling)
(glass shattering)

04:53.894 --> 04:58.330
(men grunting)
(men yelling)

05:19.286 --> 05:20.285
- Hey stop.

05:23.791 --> 05:26.625
(blood spilling)

05:28.062 --> 05:33.131
(men grunting)
(men yelling)

05:40.307 --> 05:43.141
(bones cracking)

05:49.283 --> 05:54.353
(skin smacking)
(man grunting)

06:04.565 --> 06:07.366
- [Lady] What the fuck
have you guys did?

06:07.368 --> 06:12.404
(men yelling)
(men grunting)

06:32.893 --> 06:37.195
- What the fuck are you
doing man, just leave that.

06:39.032 --> 06:41.099
- Did you see that?

08:20.767 --> 08:21.600
- [Girl] Hello.

08:21.602 --> 08:22.434
- [Man] Knockout.

08:22.436 --> 08:23.368
- [Girl] Who's this?

08:23.370 --> 08:24.569
- [Man] Show him what we got.

08:24.571 --> 08:26.037
- [Knockout] I see that
bitch on the corner

08:26.039 --> 08:27.038
with that fat old white dude
who was walking in here?

08:27.040 --> 08:29.274
- [Man] Yeah, I saw her.

08:29.276 --> 08:32.644
- [Knockout] Dog, I never seen
so much plastic on one bitch.

08:32.645 --> 08:34.346
I mean fake titties,
fake this is one thang.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.881
- [Man] I'm leaving next month.

08:35.883 --> 08:39.384
- [Man] Build that bitch
up from scratch. (chuckles)

08:41.188 --> 08:42.020
- [Man] You wanna hit one?

08:42.022 --> 08:43.421
- [Man] Yeah.

08:43.423 --> 08:44.956
- Which one's he?

08:44.958 --> 08:46.625
- I don't think so.

08:49.563 --> 08:51.663
(men laughing)

08:51.665 --> 08:53.031
- Thanks Karate.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.699
- Karate's dead dude.

08:55.903 --> 08:58.169
- Fuck, sorry man.

08:58.171 --> 08:59.571
- My boy's Knockout.

09:01.575 --> 09:04.743
- That girl was
pretty crazy looking.

09:04.745 --> 09:07.879
She was like a plastic
sexy freak show.

09:11.318 --> 09:13.418
- I see what's going on here.

09:13.420 --> 09:17.756
You guys are kind of coveting
that old man's fake wife.

09:18.792 --> 09:21.393
If you all like plastic so much,

09:22.796 --> 09:26.197
it will save you money if
you just stuck your dicks

09:26.199 --> 09:28.033
in some rubber cement.

09:33.507 --> 09:38.577
(men laughing)
(people clapping)

09:39.880 --> 09:42.647
- That's a good one Ma,
that's a good one, she funny.

09:42.649 --> 09:44.749
- Old rich, old
white motherfuckers

09:44.751 --> 09:46.751
building their 60s
freak show girls

09:46.753 --> 09:48.186
from a scratch aside.

09:50.357 --> 09:52.857
I'm just a little upset
about Karate though.

09:52.859 --> 09:53.792
- [Man] I'm sorry.

09:53.794 --> 09:55.393
- No, it's not your fault.

09:55.395 --> 09:59.064
It's just that everyone
keeps asking me

09:59.066 --> 10:02.567
where Dr. Karate is
and I have to explain

10:02.569 --> 10:07.639
like five times a day that
he got run over by a truck.

10:22.356 --> 10:25.256
(sniffing loudly)

10:26.059 --> 10:28.693
- That's pretty fucking real.

10:28.695 --> 10:29.995
- All right, definitely.

10:37.671 --> 10:38.570
- Thank you.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.075
- So.

10:46.346 --> 10:47.178
- Thank you.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.680
- [Man] Thank you.

10:48.682 --> 10:50.148
- It's good to see you
man, it's good seeing you.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.149
- Yeah.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.117
- Jimmy.

10:52.119 --> 10:52.984
- Thanks friend.

10:53.854 --> 10:55.153
- Thank you for coming.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.788
- [Knockout] Hey,
I'll see you out.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.056
- Hey what's wrong?

10:58.058 --> 10:59.424
- [Irene] What?

10:59.426 --> 11:02.460
- What, are you
mad or something?

11:02.462 --> 11:04.963
- No, I'm just tired.

11:04.965 --> 11:06.097
- Hey.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.365
- What?

11:07.367 --> 11:08.266
- Can I talk to
you for a minute?

11:08.268 --> 11:09.401
(dramatic music)

11:09.403 --> 11:12.037
- It was kind of
confusing how I wound up

11:12.039 --> 11:13.772
taking over the black market

11:13.774 --> 11:16.141
and sex trade of the whole city.

11:16.143 --> 11:17.575
(ladies laughing)

11:17.577 --> 11:21.079
I don't know if I
was lucky or smart

11:22.082 --> 11:23.848
or if my mom did it for me.

11:35.128 --> 11:38.129
(skin smacking)
(men laughing)

11:38.131 --> 11:39.097
- Ooh shit.

11:43.236 --> 11:46.104
- The now notorious serial
killer has struck again.

11:46.106 --> 11:47.605
The remains of a
young lady were found

11:47.607 --> 11:50.241
yesterday morning on
these very tracks.

11:50.243 --> 11:51.543
Police have little information

11:51.545 --> 11:53.244
as to who they're looking for.

11:53.246 --> 11:55.480
The consistencies are
that all his victims

11:55.482 --> 11:57.882
have been woman in
their early 20s.

11:57.884 --> 12:00.852
Police don't know if this is one
killer or multiple killers.

12:00.854 --> 12:03.154
What they do have evidence
of is that the same man

12:03.156 --> 12:05.657
is involved in the murders
because traces of his semen

12:05.659 --> 12:07.726
have been found on
multiple victims.

12:07.728 --> 12:09.494
Social media is
buzzing with nicknames

12:09.496 --> 12:12.297
for these now internationally
known horrific crimes.

12:12.299 --> 12:14.866
One of the many reasons this
is becoming such a panic

12:14.868 --> 12:16.367
is because this serial killer

12:16.369 --> 12:19.604
is actually posting videos
of the murders online.

12:19.606 --> 12:20.839
- What are you trying
to do Knockout?

12:20.841 --> 12:22.574
- [Reporter] The Train
Track Ripper obviously--

12:22.576 --> 12:25.210
- Scare the girls to death?

12:25.212 --> 12:26.411
(remote slamming)

12:26.413 --> 12:28.880
- Shit my bad, I just
turned on the TV.

12:30.217 --> 12:31.449
- [Red Hot] What's on your mind?

12:34.254 --> 12:35.353
- The briefcase.

12:36.490 --> 12:38.389
- I haven't forgot
about the bag man.

12:39.493 --> 12:42.227
I was just so glad we
took those guys out.

12:42.229 --> 12:44.462
- I just feel weird
about that briefcase.

12:46.399 --> 12:49.367
- Do you want half of
whatever's inside of it?

12:49.369 --> 12:51.669
- I don't want anything
that's inside of it.

12:51.671 --> 12:53.505
I just think we
should get rid of it.

12:56.777 --> 12:57.942
What's in it?

12:57.944 --> 13:02.781
- I don't know,
probably gold, diamonds.

13:04.417 --> 13:08.219
I don't know, you sure
you don't want half.

13:11.625 --> 13:12.590
Let's check.

13:12.592 --> 13:15.393
(dramatic music)

13:24.504 --> 13:26.271
(man sighing)

13:26.273 --> 13:29.040
Yep, it's coke.

13:35.115 --> 13:39.584
- I don't think it's coke
man, it gives bad energy.

13:39.586 --> 13:42.387
(heavy sniffing)

13:43.423 --> 13:47.225
- Nope, it's definitely
good white flake.

13:48.695 --> 13:53.231
Not bad energy,
sometimes gold is white.

13:54.734 --> 13:57.535
(dramatic music)

13:59.306 --> 14:01.673
- Hey mister, can you
spare some change?

14:04.110 --> 14:06.878
- [Knockout] Here's
a coin, there you go.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.813
- I wish I was big
and strong like you.

14:09.749 --> 14:12.817
(Knockout laughing)

14:13.854 --> 14:15.220
- [Knockout] Cute dog man.

14:18.124 --> 14:19.490
- I'm running low on coke.

14:20.627 --> 14:21.659
- [Lady] Ah.

14:21.661 --> 14:24.529
(traffic roaring)

14:38.678 --> 14:41.579
(ladies laughing)

14:50.824 --> 14:53.825
(lighter flicking)

14:54.661 --> 14:57.328
(man coughing)

15:03.603 --> 15:05.803
- Each time I opened my eyes,

15:05.805 --> 15:08.306
the sun was blotted
out a little more.

15:15.115 --> 15:18.516
(man breathing heavily)

15:20.353 --> 15:21.252
Hello.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.822
- Hey man, how it's going?

15:24.824 --> 15:28.092
- Red Hot, I don't think
I can keep partying man.

15:30.397 --> 15:32.397
I'm getting too
old or something.

15:32.399 --> 15:34.365
- Too old for what?

15:34.367 --> 15:37.535
Don't start pussying
out on me now.

15:37.537 --> 15:40.605
- (coughing) This whole life
thing man, I can't handle it.

15:41.975 --> 15:43.474
I'm not good at it.

15:43.476 --> 15:45.310
- Dude, you just
sound hung over.

15:46.413 --> 15:48.980
Drink your fucking beer,
do your fucking blow,

15:48.982 --> 15:51.249
brush your fucking
teeth, take a shower,

15:51.251 --> 15:54.052
and shut the hell up.

15:54.054 --> 15:56.421
I'm bringing Beth and
Tanya to party with you.

15:58.792 --> 16:01.726
- [Gaven] Those are the
two girls that I'm with.

16:01.728 --> 16:04.495
- They were literally
snort halos of white powder

16:04.497 --> 16:08.199
around your sweaty
miserable face.

16:10.337 --> 16:12.070
- That doesn't make any sense.

16:12.072 --> 16:14.339
- Dude, you got to get
your head on straight.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.708
They're both Korea prostitutes.

16:19.946 --> 16:22.380
- They're still
girls with feelings.

16:23.950 --> 16:25.583
- Yeah, kinda.

16:26.753 --> 16:29.687
- I just don't know if
I can keep partying man.

16:29.689 --> 16:33.091
- Do you wanna go to
heaven or hell tonight man.

16:33.093 --> 16:38.162
(upbeat music)
(people laughing)

17:33.386 --> 17:36.054
(man laughing)

17:37.190 --> 17:39.991
- [Gaven] Did you
see that perv man?

17:44.164 --> 17:46.531
If he worked here,
he'd be going nuts.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.700
- The train track
ripper has struck again.

17:49.702 --> 17:52.670
It is now thought that he's
murdered at least 10 women.

17:52.672 --> 17:54.372
All these victims
are young women

17:54.374 --> 17:56.507
and the uniqueness of
these horrible crimes

17:56.509 --> 17:58.910
is that they have all been
bound to train tracks,

17:58.912 --> 18:01.779
apparently by a skilled
Kinbaku practitioner.

18:01.781 --> 18:05.683
Having them run over by trains
is his method of killing.

18:05.685 --> 18:08.119
Now there's currently a massive
manhunt spanning the city.

18:08.121 --> 18:10.188
Obviously focused
largely on train tracks

18:10.190 --> 18:12.824
and law enforcement agencies
are trying to track him online

18:12.826 --> 18:14.592
because he won't
stop posting videos

18:14.594 --> 18:16.160
of these gruesome murders.

18:16.162 --> 18:17.829
So far he continues to do this

18:17.831 --> 18:20.998
without leaving a trace
of his whereabouts.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.567
This is Zach Eagmon reporting.

18:24.404 --> 18:26.170
(remote thudding)

18:26.172 --> 18:29.607
- Why can't they catch
this sick fuck already?

18:29.609 --> 18:31.676
- Police can't do
anything right.

18:32.812 --> 18:37.882
(man laughing)
(dramatic music)

18:47.393 --> 18:50.294
(people laughing)

19:11.351 --> 19:15.786
- Red Hot, he had an
endless appetite for more.

19:17.991 --> 19:19.991
There could never
be enough money,

19:20.793 --> 19:22.793
he could never have enough power

19:24.631 --> 19:27.498
and I was never good enough.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.304
- Why are these roses here?

19:33.306 --> 19:35.606
- (scoffs) Some weird client

19:35.608 --> 19:39.510
sends them to me every
few months, I don't know.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.246
You girls can take
it if you want.

19:44.150 --> 19:46.951
- Red roses, how cliche.

19:49.889 --> 19:52.690
(dramatic music)

20:02.202 --> 20:05.102
(ladies laughing)

20:19.652 --> 20:22.720
(people chattering)

20:52.418 --> 20:56.387
- I've been drunk and high for
months now, getting weaker.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.790
I've always gotten
everything that I wanted.

21:00.627 --> 21:02.460
I wanted a beautiful girl,

21:03.630 --> 21:06.097
and for my damnation my
old friend gave my two.

21:08.101 --> 21:11.269
(trains roaring)
(people chattering)

21:11.271 --> 21:14.071
- Would you rather be
really fucking high

21:14.073 --> 21:15.439
or sober right now?

21:16.476 --> 21:17.341
- High.

21:18.244 --> 21:19.143
- [Lady] Me too.

21:20.713 --> 21:23.414
- So, why don't you
guys just stay drunk

21:23.416 --> 21:25.650
or high all the time,

21:25.652 --> 21:29.387
because you're gonna
die either way right?

21:30.757 --> 21:33.057
- Well that makes about as
much sense as anything else.

21:34.560 --> 21:37.161
- [Lady] I pick him, hello.

21:37.163 --> 21:41.499
Oh my God, be careful.

21:42.902 --> 21:46.203
- I wanted to be a model and
wound up being a prostitute.

21:49.475 --> 21:51.993
- [Lady] Oh.

21:51.994 --> 21:54.512
- Man might go out and rob
someone or kill someone,

21:55.348 --> 21:58.349
we do this, this is better.

21:58.351 --> 22:01.085
We make people feel
good, for them.

22:04.257 --> 22:06.457
- [Girls] Hello, hi.

22:06.459 --> 22:07.725
(tires squealing)

22:07.727 --> 22:10.594
- Someone's about to get
some cash and chlamydia.

22:10.596 --> 22:12.763
(ladies laughing)

22:12.765 --> 22:15.199
- Hey, I want to
bring two of you girls

22:15.201 --> 22:17.868
to the hotel across the street.

22:18.938 --> 22:21.772
(dramatic music)

22:28.815 --> 22:32.283
- [Irene] They kept finding
mangled remains of women

22:32.285 --> 22:34.685
on the train tracks
outside of town.

22:35.788 --> 22:38.122
That sicko was pushing his luck.

22:43.396 --> 22:47.798
- There she is, this
is some darkness.

22:49.035 --> 22:52.203
I'm going to follow you
right back to your nest.

22:54.240 --> 22:55.106
- He's okay.

22:55.108 --> 22:55.940
- He's good right?

22:55.942 --> 22:57.608
No, he's more than okay.

22:57.610 --> 22:59.677
- I'm going to fuck her so hard,

23:00.847 --> 23:03.981
I'm going to keep her in
my basement for so long

23:03.983 --> 23:07.318
that she'll be pregnant
by the time she dies.

23:08.421 --> 23:10.554
- Come on, he's fucking
too much or something,

23:10.556 --> 23:11.789
but you know.

23:11.791 --> 23:14.592
(dramatic music)

23:18.364 --> 23:19.997
It's great, he's cool.

23:25.471 --> 23:30.541
James Diamond, what are you
doing on my side of town?

23:32.211 --> 23:35.846
- Red Hot, we know what you did.

23:35.848 --> 23:38.015
Blue Sky is not happy.

23:38.017 --> 23:40.317
You stole his shit.

23:40.319 --> 23:42.987
- Do I look happy to
you right now James.

23:43.956 --> 23:45.790
Look me dead in the eyes

23:45.792 --> 23:49.059
and tell me that I
look fucking happy.

23:49.061 --> 23:54.131
- Hey, Blue Sky told me to
tell you that he misses you.

23:55.501 --> 23:58.869
He says the two of you were
close when you were kids.

23:58.871 --> 23:59.703
(glass shattering)

23:59.705 --> 24:02.373
(man groaning)

24:14.086 --> 24:15.152
(bone cracking)

24:15.154 --> 24:17.721
(man yelling)

24:19.692 --> 24:22.493
(man whimpering)

24:25.665 --> 24:30.568
- You and Blue Sky are gonna
stay on your own side of town.

24:30.570 --> 24:35.573
Or I'm gonna have my security
Knockout fuck your fat wife.

24:35.575 --> 24:36.607
How's that sound?

24:37.577 --> 24:39.977
- Other, he got hit by a truck.

24:41.247 --> 24:45.149
- That was my old
security Dr. Karate dude.

24:47.653 --> 24:48.919
(skin smacking)

With the mask on, I can

25:57.323 --> 26:00.958
With the mask off, those
rules will break me.

26:01.961 --> 26:04.728
- Gaven, you're crazy man.

26:04.730 --> 26:08.732
- With the mask on, you
will do anything I say.

26:10.136 --> 26:13.671
With the mask off, I wouldn't
know what to tell you to do.

take off your panties.

27:07.159 --> 27:10.227
Now lay down on the couch
and spread your legs.

27:18.337 --> 27:19.236
- Wait.

27:21.641 --> 27:25.142
- What, I really thought
I had you hypnotized.

27:26.846 --> 27:31.382
- You did, but are you
hypnotizing Tanya too?

27:35.855 --> 27:37.955
- There's no one here
besides me and you.

27:39.258 --> 27:43.127
- I know that, but you
only come see me these days

27:43.129 --> 27:45.529
when Tanya's out
working and I'm not.

27:46.432 --> 27:49.266
(dramatic music)

27:53.539 --> 27:54.972
(girl moaning)

27:54.974 --> 27:58.075
- This shit in my
brain pops up so high.

27:59.445 --> 28:02.846
It's like I need 10,000 virgin
angels to carry me above it.

28:07.453 --> 28:10.054
(upbeat music)

28:44.123 --> 28:45.456
(liquid pouring)

28:45.458 --> 28:46.356
You hungry?

28:47.259 --> 28:49.326
- Yeah, that looks good.

29:00.539 --> 29:02.873
There's two kinds of love.

29:02.875 --> 29:05.676
Strawberry love
and Twinkie love.

29:06.812 --> 29:08.212
A Twinkie can sit
there for decades

29:08.214 --> 29:10.114
and it'll still be
creamy and sweet.

29:11.183 --> 29:13.083
A strawberry's juicy
and also sweet,

29:13.085 --> 29:16.954
but if you leave it out it'll
rot in just a couple of days.

29:18.224 --> 29:21.291
(fruit squishing)

29:21.293 --> 29:23.093
- Only a prostitute
would say that.

29:25.197 --> 29:30.267
(dramatic music)
(patrons chattering)

29:48.587 --> 29:53.657
- Quiet now, caution, danger
is approaching us as I speak.

29:57.663 --> 29:59.329
- Mom, what's happening.

29:59.331 --> 30:01.131
Are we about to
see something ugly?

30:02.101 --> 30:03.867
- You don't have to worry.

30:05.938 --> 30:08.772
(dramatic music)

30:28.360 --> 30:31.328
- Any of you boys
got any firearms?

30:32.565 --> 30:36.466
Look, if you hand them
to me now, discreetly,

30:37.603 --> 30:38.902
we'll let you leave
and you can go back

30:38.904 --> 30:40.571
to your side of town.

30:48.681 --> 30:52.449
- Give all your weapons
to him, no count.

30:53.986 --> 30:54.918
(ominous music)

30:54.920 --> 30:56.553
Give up your guns.

30:56.555 --> 30:58.355
Give up your weapons.

30:59.859 --> 31:01.391
Give me your guns.

31:02.761 --> 31:05.062
- [Man] Give him your guns.

31:06.498 --> 31:08.232
- Give him your guns.

31:29.021 --> 31:31.154
- Gaven, grab my backpack,

31:31.156 --> 31:32.422
we'll zip tie these fools

31:32.424 --> 31:34.324
and take 'em back
to the penthouse.

31:34.326 --> 31:37.160
(dramatic music)

31:58.317 --> 32:01.351
(Knockout laughing)

32:19.672 --> 32:21.939
- Is this what you guys
were trying to find?

32:23.442 --> 32:25.442
- Click, click,
click, click Red Hot.

32:26.745 --> 32:28.912
We'll stay on our side of town,

32:28.914 --> 32:32.082
just let me reach my phone
so I can make a call,

32:32.084 --> 32:34.051
and then we'll be out of here.

32:35.421 --> 32:38.155
I mean we understand, it's
tough getting fucked up.

32:38.157 --> 32:41.625
Between you and Blue Sky is
not what I wanna deal with.

32:42.761 --> 32:47.564
We're happy on the
other side of town.

32:47.566 --> 32:50.033
(dramatic music)

32:50.035 --> 32:53.270
(high heels clicking)

33:51.330 --> 33:53.997
- Do you have a
girlfriend, wife?

33:57.736 --> 33:58.635
I'll take that as yes.

34:03.242 --> 34:07.444
- Whoa ladies, that look
way too good for them.

34:07.446 --> 34:08.378
Let me get a little
taste of that.

34:08.380 --> 34:11.114
(skin smacking)

34:13.418 --> 34:14.985
- Thank you.

34:14.987 --> 34:16.887
- [Lady] Die in peace.

34:19.324 --> 34:20.489
Die in peace.

34:21.293 --> 34:23.092
- Hmm, this is tasty.

34:31.804 --> 34:34.471
(men slurping)

34:37.943 --> 34:40.677
- [Lady] Die, die, die in peace.

34:42.648 --> 34:45.514
(lady laughing)

34:45.516 --> 34:47.684
- [Irene] My mom
said that The Ripper

34:47.686 --> 34:51.353
was too bad for the
food that kills.

34:51.356 --> 34:53.790
She wanted to hurt him
even worse than that.

34:55.761 --> 34:58.762
(ladies screaming)

34:59.565 --> 35:01.298
Mom, Uncle.

35:01.300 --> 35:02.766
- [Uncle] Mm-hmm.

35:02.768 --> 35:03.834
- I have a question.

35:04.837 --> 35:05.902
- Yes.

35:07.406 --> 35:11.575
- Is it true that Grandma
always put poison in everything?

35:12.945 --> 35:16.213
- I didn't know you
remembered that.

35:16.215 --> 35:18.982
Our mom went crazy
towards the end.

35:20.452 --> 35:23.019
- She actually
poisoned our brother.

35:24.056 --> 35:26.590
- You mean I had two uncles?

35:27.693 --> 35:29.359
- Yeah, I had another brother.

35:30.496 --> 35:33.029
But your grandma went
mad and poisoned him.

35:35.200 --> 35:38.502
- And some other
family and friends.

35:38.504 --> 35:41.438
She was just making up
all kinds of poisoned food

35:42.608 --> 35:46.710
and candies, beautiful desserts.

35:46.712 --> 35:51.781
And soups and everything
and just inviting

35:52.885 --> 35:54.651
everyone over for
dinner all the time.

35:56.388 --> 36:01.191
- What's the secret family
recipe for the food that kills?

36:01.193 --> 36:03.393
- It's better if you
don't know that yet.

36:04.530 --> 36:06.096
- Just tell me Mom,
it's just a recipe.

36:06.098 --> 36:07.797
- It's a secret recipe.

36:10.469 --> 36:12.602
- How did Grandma really die?

36:15.140 --> 36:18.575
- Snakes aren't immune
to their own venom.

36:20.445 --> 36:22.112
- Grandma poisoned herself?

36:23.682 --> 36:26.416
- A snake eats its own tail.

36:29.955 --> 36:33.089
(dramatic music)

36:33.091 --> 36:36.660
(guitar strumming)

36:36.662 --> 36:37.561
- Fuck.

36:40.532 --> 36:41.431
- Hey mister.

36:45.304 --> 36:49.973
- I know, I know, you
want another coin.

36:49.975 --> 36:52.075
What are you, a token for pity?

36:54.846 --> 36:57.280
I give you a coin every
day on my way to work,

36:57.282 --> 36:59.649
why don't you go
to another block?

36:59.651 --> 37:02.018
- Can I just have a coin
for some food mister?

37:03.088 --> 37:06.690
- (chuckles) I've told
you like 10 times,

37:06.692 --> 37:10.460
my name is Knockout, yet
you still call me mister.

37:16.268 --> 37:19.936
There's five coins, now
I'm gonna strongly suggest

37:21.240 --> 37:24.007
you go to another block
because I'm getting real tired

37:24.009 --> 37:25.976
of passing through
your totem for pity

37:25.978 --> 37:28.011
every day on my way to work.

37:28.013 --> 37:29.145
(dramatic music)

37:29.147 --> 37:30.280
- [Man] Frankie, what's that.

37:30.282 --> 37:31.214
(shutter flashing)

37:31.216 --> 37:32.482
Right there, give me one more.

37:32.484 --> 37:33.717
Give me some tittie,
give my some breasteses,

37:33.719 --> 37:35.085
breasteses right there.

37:35.087 --> 37:37.487
Give me one more,
give me right here.

37:37.489 --> 37:38.788
Bam there it is, all right next,

37:38.790 --> 37:40.423
reel 'em in, reel
'em in, reel 'em in.

37:40.425 --> 37:41.258
Next come on.

37:41.260 --> 37:42.492
(ladies chattering)

37:42.494 --> 37:44.094
Ride the broom, ride the
broom, ride the broom,

37:44.096 --> 37:45.528
there it is, ride the broom.

37:45.530 --> 37:47.631

38:04.683 --> 38:06.716
Yeah, it's samba time.

38:06.718 --> 38:08.852
It's samba time, there it is.

38:26.438 --> 38:28.305

more, here we go.

38:28.307 --> 38:30.473
All right love the bear, I
need you to love the bear.

38:30.475 --> 38:31.808
Love the bear, give
it to the bear.

38:31.810 --> 38:33.543
I want you to give
it to the bear.

38:33.545 --> 38:35.679
There you go, oh yeah.

38:35.681 --> 38:38.048
That's so mysterious.

38:38.050 --> 38:39.849
All right get big, get big.

38:39.851 --> 38:41.818
Do it, do it, yeah.

38:41.820 --> 38:44.287

you're a naughty pig.

38:44.289 --> 38:46.056

you pig, yes you do.

38:46.058 --> 38:47.324

38:47.326 --> 38:48.558

39:49.087 --> 39:49.986
Oh yeah.

39:53.625 --> 39:54.524
- Hey man.

39:57.963 --> 40:00.130
Do you think I'm a good pimp?

40:00.132 --> 40:02.632
- You're a great pimp.

40:02.634 --> 40:05.702
- I feel like there's
more cops on this money,

40:05.704 --> 40:07.871
there's more competition
and less to win.

40:08.974 --> 40:10.874
- That's because
you already won.

40:13.245 --> 40:15.912
We started out with
nothing, remember?

40:17.749 --> 40:22.085
You built all this,
you fucking won.

40:22.087 --> 40:23.553

40:23.555 --> 40:26.389

I'm just having a moment.

I just wanna leave town.

40:53.752 --> 40:54.851
- That's a good idea.

40:56.755 --> 40:59.989
- I have about a half a
million dollars saved.

41:02.661 --> 41:04.294
Do you wanna just split with me?

41:05.831 --> 41:08.431
Leave the country and
have a fresh start?

41:10.101 --> 41:12.435
- Why are you teasing me?

41:12.437 --> 41:14.204
'Cause that would be
a really mean trick

41:14.206 --> 41:15.405
if you're teasing me.

41:19.244 --> 41:20.243

this horrible life and place.

you, bring your ass girl.

44:25.964 --> 44:27.797
Bring your titties
too, we need 'em both.

44:27.799 --> 44:29.565
Come on girl, where you at?

44:29.567 --> 44:31.167
Tanya, Tanya, Tanya!

44:33.405 --> 44:34.537
Let's get it.

44:42.647 --> 44:45.014
- [Gaven] You have
enough to drink babe?

44:45.016 --> 44:50.086
- I'm good, I just miss you.

44:51.623 --> 44:53.356
I can't stop thinking about you.

44:55.193 --> 44:56.759
- You shouldn't care about me.

44:58.096 --> 44:59.028
- But I do.

45:01.366 --> 45:05.034
- We used to go over
to my grandma's house

45:05.036 --> 45:07.437
all the time when I was a kid.

45:08.339 --> 45:11.974
We just didn't eat dinner ever.

45:14.045 --> 45:16.245
- That doesn't make any sense.

45:16.247 --> 45:17.880
- It does make sense.

45:19.417 --> 45:23.686
My grandma was crazy, so
all the food was poisoned.

45:23.688 --> 45:26.856
All the water, all
the saki, everything.

45:26.858 --> 45:29.525
I wasn't even allowed
to eat candy over there.

45:31.029 --> 45:34.497
So we would go over
there for dinner,

45:34.499 --> 45:36.499
we just wouldn't eat dinner.

45:37.769 --> 45:39.969
- So you would just
sit there and talk

45:39.971 --> 45:41.437
and stare at your food.

45:42.841 --> 45:46.976
- That's all I've been trying
to tell you for the past hour.

45:46.978 --> 45:50.980
My mom and I would go
over there for dinner,

45:50.982 --> 45:53.149
we just never had dinner.

45:54.753 --> 45:57.186
- But you can see how
this sounds confusing.

45:58.423 --> 46:00.823
You went over there for dinner,

46:00.825 --> 46:03.259
but you didn't go
over there for dinner.

46:10.168 --> 46:12.268
- You ready to go home babe?

46:12.270 --> 46:13.503
- [Tanya] Yeah.

46:13.505 --> 46:15.838
- You got to help me
figure this out first.

46:17.142 --> 46:20.643
She's saying that
she and her mom

46:20.645 --> 46:24.447
used to go over to her
grandma's house for dinner,

46:25.517 --> 46:28.684
but never had dinner
at her grandma's house.

46:30.021 --> 46:32.622
- God Red Hot, she's just
saying that they couldn't eat

46:32.624 --> 46:34.590
any of the food at
her grandma's house

46:34.592 --> 46:36.192
because it was all poisoned,

46:36.194 --> 46:38.227
but they still visit
her and not eat.

46:40.565 --> 46:42.532
- Now that makes a
little more sense.

46:45.270 --> 46:48.237
But is that shit crazy?

46:48.239 --> 46:50.540
- Call me in the morning man.

46:50.542 --> 46:52.341
I gotta get some rest.

46:57.515 --> 47:02.218
- So you did or you didn't
have dinner with the grandma?

47:03.621 --> 47:06.455
'Cause it's kind of like not
going over there for dinner.

47:06.457 --> 47:08.825
- I don't understand what
you don't understand.

47:09.928 --> 47:12.428
My grandma is trying to
poison her own family!

47:16.935 --> 47:18.201
(dramatic music)

47:18.203 --> 47:20.937
(body thudding)

47:22.740 --> 47:23.906
- What are you saying?

47:26.144 --> 47:27.877
You gonna poison me?

47:42.393 --> 47:43.860
- That was weird.

47:44.762 --> 47:46.462
- You okay sweetheart?

47:46.464 --> 47:49.732
- [Irene] Yeah, he's
just wasted, that's all.

47:49.734 --> 47:53.936
Just go, Jesus. (sobbing)

47:53.938 --> 47:55.304
- Are you all right?

47:55.306 --> 47:56.205
- Just go!

48:05.149 --> 48:08.384
My dad was put in jail
before I was born.

48:09.721 --> 48:13.589
He was let out less than a
week before my 10th birthday.

48:15.193 --> 48:17.960
By the time my birthday came,

48:17.962 --> 48:19.495
he had already been
shot and killed.

48:22.967 --> 48:25.935
One bullet in each eye.

48:25.937 --> 48:28.404
(gun firing)

48:31.175 --> 48:33.843
- I'm holding this
whole thing together.

48:33.845 --> 48:36.345
You're out there fucking
a bunch of other guys.

48:36.347 --> 48:38.915
- You've got enough money
for us to leave town on.

48:40.051 --> 48:41.484
If you really want
me to stop working

48:41.486 --> 48:44.353
and quit doing drugs, why don't
we just leave the country.

48:44.355 --> 48:46.489
- If I make just a
little bit more money,

48:47.625 --> 48:49.859
we can live however we
want wherever we want.

48:51.396 --> 48:53.863
- If you're not gonna take me
away from this horrible life

48:53.865 --> 48:55.631
that we both admittingly hate,

48:56.768 --> 48:58.267
will you at least
take me to dinner?

48:59.570 --> 49:01.070
- Of course baby, come on.

49:03.107 --> 49:05.942
(dramatic music)

49:26.431 --> 49:30.800
- The question for you is,
not how I live my life.

49:30.802 --> 49:32.735
The question for you is,

49:32.737 --> 49:35.271
what kind of love do
you want in yours?

49:36.741 --> 49:39.375
(upbeat music)

49:51.189 --> 49:53.356

49:53.358 --> 49:56.058

Love normally goes
away in the middle.

51:25.316 --> 51:27.483

53:54.165 --> 53:55.631
There you go, oh.

53:56.767 --> 54:00.169
♪ Everybody stand
in front of you ♪

54:00.171 --> 54:02.571
♪ Foolishly going around ♪

54:02.573 --> 54:04.540
- I want my coke.

54:07.345 --> 54:10.112
(dramatic music)

54:12.149 --> 54:14.984
(fabric ripping)

54:25.129 --> 54:30.199
- Oh, she was half a ghost
already, one foot in the grave.

54:34.071 --> 54:36.872
But at the same time,
she was more alive

54:36.874 --> 54:39.808
than anyone I'd ever known.

54:39.810 --> 54:41.043
- You fuckant.

54:43.314 --> 54:44.580
You didn't ever fuck me!

54:47.218 --> 54:52.288
You fuckant. (groaning)

54:53.591 --> 54:56.792
- You're completely helpless.

54:56.794 --> 55:01.130
- You're gonna die you
fuckant, even if I die today.

55:03.134 --> 55:05.000
- Do you like it?

55:05.002 --> 55:08.103
(train horn blowing)

55:09.607 --> 55:12.441
(girl screaming)

55:30.728 --> 55:34.763
- Yeah, they can be at
your place in half an hour.

55:37.101 --> 55:41.704
Yeah, great, thank
you honey, no problem.

55:41.706 --> 55:42.604
I love you too.

55:47.812 --> 55:49.445
(Irene sighing)

55:49.447 --> 55:51.647
Beth, Debbie, get ready.

55:53.584 --> 55:56.151
- Once again the notorious
train track ripper has murdered

55:56.153 --> 55:59.288
a young woman using these
very tracks as his weapon.

55:59.290 --> 56:00.823
Police are baffled.

56:00.825 --> 56:03.592
He appears to be a master in
the binding art of Kinbaku

56:03.594 --> 56:07.329
and continues to post videos
of his grisly murders online,

56:07.331 --> 56:08.530
Still leaving law enforcement

56:08.532 --> 56:11.934
with no leads to his
whereabouts or identity.

56:11.936 --> 56:15.037
I'm saying he, but technically
investigators don't know

56:15.039 --> 56:17.740
if this is one man or a group.

56:17.742 --> 56:20.142
Some think it could be a
cult with computer hackers

56:20.144 --> 56:22.444
and Kinbaku masters involved.

56:22.446 --> 56:24.546
The most recent victim
has been identified

56:24.548 --> 56:27.783
as Mandy Ericson, a 21
year old female escort.

56:27.785 --> 56:30.052
Police believe she
was probably picked up

56:30.054 --> 56:32.187
off the street in
the Temple District.

56:36.660 --> 56:38.427
- She just said Mandy Ericson?

56:41.198 --> 56:44.099
My God, I saw her
get into his car.

56:47.571 --> 56:48.704
- You saw The Ripper?

56:50.307 --> 56:52.341
- Fuck, Mandy's dead.

56:57.248 --> 56:59.581
- Did you get a
good look on him?

56:59.583 --> 57:01.283
- Mandy's dead.

57:01.285 --> 57:02.718
- Did you see him?

57:04.121 --> 57:05.020
- Yes.

57:05.823 --> 57:07.389
- Are you sure?

57:07.391 --> 57:08.223
- Yes.

57:13.531 --> 57:16.298
- Fuck, I'm gonna have
to watch this shit

57:16.300 --> 57:19.101
to make sure it's Mandy.

57:19.103 --> 57:21.537
None of you girls watch
this sicko's post.

57:21.539 --> 57:24.606
(suspenseful music)

57:30.714 --> 57:31.613
- It's her.

57:33.717 --> 57:36.618
(snorting loudly)

57:40.124 --> 57:42.958
(Uncle chanting)

57:50.167 --> 57:52.067
- Put daddy in the house.

57:53.971 --> 57:59.041
Make him as big as any
birds, tiny as a dot.

58:00.211 --> 58:03.011
(Uncle chanting)

58:08.419 --> 58:13.422
Put daddy on the ceiling,
put daddy on the floor.

58:15.426 --> 58:19.728
Turn him red, turn him purple.

58:19.730 --> 58:21.597
- What's Uncle doing to Betsy?

58:25.102 --> 58:28.637
- She can't stop having
nightmares about The Ripper.

58:28.639 --> 58:32.608
So, he's making her dreams stop.

58:34.044 --> 58:35.677
- She's right to be scared.

58:38.148 --> 58:40.382
Fuck her dreams stopping mom?

58:40.384 --> 58:42.818
And let's make The
Ripper's heart stop.

58:44.755 --> 58:46.922
- I recognize that fire.

58:51.662 --> 58:53.829
You have your father's eyes.

58:55.399 --> 58:59.268
- Before or after he
got a bullet in each?

58:59.270 --> 59:01.937
(upbeat music)

59:32.670 --> 59:33.869
- Hey, hey, hey,
don't get glitter

59:33.871 --> 59:36.438
in the drugs or my drink.

59:38.175 --> 59:40.509
- Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, Mandy just texted me.

59:41.445 --> 59:43.879
What are you up to sweetie, hey.

59:44.915 --> 59:48.584
- [Lady] What,
that's mind boggling.

59:48.586 --> 59:49.585
- See.

59:49.587 --> 59:52.588
(ladies laughing)

59:52.590 --> 59:54.189
- [Lady] I see, that's Mandy.

59:54.191 --> 59:57.359
- [Lady] Wait a second,
let me see that.

59:57.361 --> 59:58.193
- [Lady] Ooh shit.

59:58.195 --> 59:59.661
- [Lady] My God.

59:59.663 --> 01:00:00.963
- [Lady] I wanna see that too.

01:00:00.965 --> 01:00:03.432
(suspenseful music)

01:00:03.434 --> 01:00:04.433
- Holy shit.

01:00:06.737 --> 01:00:08.704
- That can't be
right, Mandy's dead.

01:00:09.673 --> 01:00:11.173
- [Lady] Give it back, hey.

01:00:11.175 --> 01:00:14.176
(ladies chattering)

01:00:14.178 --> 01:00:15.010
- [Lady] Hey, hey,

01:00:15.012 --> 01:00:16.612
- [Lady] I wanna see it.

01:00:16.614 --> 01:00:18.180
- Also they're
posting pictures, see?

01:00:18.182 --> 01:00:20.015
- Yeah, this is Mandy.

01:00:20.851 --> 01:00:24.319
(phone beeping)

01:00:24.321 --> 01:00:25.520
- It's Mandy.

01:00:25.522 --> 01:00:26.521
- [Lady] No really?

01:00:28.292 --> 01:00:30.258
- She just texted me too.

01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:32.661
She's saying she
wants to hang out.

01:00:32.663 --> 01:00:36.031
She wants me to come meet
her at Club Waterfall,

01:00:36.033 --> 01:00:38.367
but I mean it's not
really Mandy, is it?

01:00:39.637 --> 01:00:40.869
- It can't be.

01:00:40.871 --> 01:00:42.804
- Well I guess those
videos of the murders

01:00:42.806 --> 01:00:44.940
could be digital
effect or something.

01:00:44.942 --> 01:00:47.709
- Isn't everything a
digital effect these days?

01:00:48.979 --> 01:00:50.946
- Do you guys believe in God?

01:00:52.383 --> 01:00:55.751
- Of course, what are
you talking about?

01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:57.786
- And the devil?

01:00:59.723 --> 01:01:01.256
(ladies laughing)

01:01:01.258 --> 01:01:03.258
She wants me to meet her
at Club Waterfall tonight,

01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:04.793
on the dance floor,

01:01:04.795 --> 01:01:07.929
just to the left of
the waterfall at nine.

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:11.166
Well, maybe it really is Mandy.

01:01:12.436 --> 01:01:13.969
Maybe she's not dead.

01:01:13.971 --> 01:01:16.471
Maybe she's trapped
somewhere and needs our help.

01:01:18.842 --> 01:01:21.109
- I can sneak into Club
Waterfall and check.

01:01:22.312 --> 01:01:25.447
It's crowded,
nobody will see me.

01:01:25.449 --> 01:01:28.617
(train horn blowing)

01:01:34.224 --> 01:01:37.025
(girl screaming)

01:01:38.662 --> 01:01:41.396
(phone ringing)

01:01:47.538 --> 01:01:50.338
(bottle hissing)

01:01:55.879 --> 01:01:58.513
(upbeat music)

01:02:03.787 --> 01:02:06.288
(ladies laughing)

01:02:06.290 --> 01:02:08.924
(body thudding)

01:02:51.268 --> 01:02:52.400
- Hello?

01:02:52.402 --> 01:02:53.301
- [Beth] Hey.

01:02:54.404 --> 01:02:55.804
- Hey.

01:02:55.806 --> 01:02:58.206
- I haven't eaten
since Mandy died.

01:02:58.208 --> 01:03:01.143
I've just been drinking
whiskey and coffee

01:03:02.246 --> 01:03:03.612
and now I'm doing whippits.

01:03:05.883 --> 01:03:07.883
- You can't just stoop eating.

01:03:07.885 --> 01:03:09.384
- I don't care anymore.

01:03:10.654 --> 01:03:13.355
Bring me a Philly
cheesesteak with no steak.

01:03:14.858 --> 01:03:16.792
- A Philly cheesesteak
with no steak?

01:03:17.861 --> 01:03:19.427
What kind of sandwich is that?

01:03:21.431 --> 01:03:24.065
But I'll have one delivered
to the studio for you.

01:03:26.937 --> 01:03:29.070
- If I was Tanya you'd
bring it yourself

01:03:30.207 --> 01:03:33.108
and you wouldn't say
that it was strange.

01:03:33.110 --> 01:03:36.311
You just love her and
you don't love me.

01:03:39.049 --> 01:03:40.749
- Of course I love you.

01:03:42.486 --> 01:03:45.353
If I didn't love you I
wouldn't even answer the phone.

01:03:45.355 --> 01:03:47.722
I'm just hanging out here
with Red Hot and Irene,

01:03:47.724 --> 01:03:48.890
getting some rest.

01:03:50.394 --> 01:03:51.993
- Well Tanya's out working,

01:03:53.463 --> 01:03:55.764
you'd rather spend
time with them than me?

01:03:57.334 --> 01:03:58.733
You won't even
bring me a sandwich

01:03:58.735 --> 01:04:00.202
when I haven't eaten in days

01:04:00.204 --> 01:04:01.670
because my best friend
might have gotten murdered

01:04:01.672 --> 01:04:03.805
and I might be next.

01:04:03.807 --> 01:04:06.675
- Wait a minute, did you say
might have gotten murdered?

01:04:08.445 --> 01:04:10.278
I know it's hard to accept.

01:04:12.549 --> 01:04:15.684
Hey look baby, I'm
gonna hang up the phone

01:04:15.686 --> 01:04:17.085
and order your sandwich.

01:04:19.323 --> 01:04:22.624
(can hissing)

01:04:22.626 --> 01:04:24.759
(Gaven sighing)

01:04:24.761 --> 01:04:27.696
- Fucking Philly
cheesesteak with no steak.

01:04:29.166 --> 01:04:30.632
- That shit is fucked up.

01:04:34.972 --> 01:04:37.505
- Let's go to bed, I'm tired.

01:04:37.507 --> 01:04:38.974
- [Red Hot] Yeah, of course.

01:04:47.651 --> 01:04:48.650
Good night.

01:04:54.825 --> 01:04:57.659
- Can you guys make a Philly
cheesesteak with no steak?

01:04:59.129 --> 01:05:01.029
(dramatic music)

01:05:01.031 --> 01:05:03.932
(train roaring)

01:05:03.934 --> 01:05:07.736
- I just got my Philly
cheesesteak with no steak,

01:05:07.738 --> 01:05:09.871
but it's completely uncooked.

01:05:11.808 --> 01:05:12.741
- I'm sorry babe.

01:05:14.144 --> 01:05:16.912
Well I told you it
was a strange order.

01:05:16.914 --> 01:05:19.080
I guess the cheesesteak
people just got confused

01:05:19.082 --> 01:05:21.116
making a cheesesteak
with no steak.

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:25.353
You got to eat something.

01:05:25.355 --> 01:05:27.756
- This sandwich is cold
and raw and so are you.

01:05:28.825 --> 01:05:31.626
(phone thudding)

01:05:35.899 --> 01:05:38.566
(solemn music)

01:05:42.539 --> 01:05:45.340
(dramatic music)

01:05:47.811 --> 01:05:51.046
(train bells ringing)

01:06:01.258 --> 01:06:03.658
- Dust off the love, pretty boy.

01:06:05.195 --> 01:06:07.295
Before you start
growing feathers.

01:06:08.465 --> 01:06:12.934
- Sometimes I feel
like Tanya and Beth

01:06:12.936 --> 01:06:15.503
are trying to rip me apart
like two starving dogs.

01:06:17.908 --> 01:06:20.709
- Gaven, you just seem like

01:06:20.711 --> 01:06:23.845
you're having some
attachment issues.

01:06:45.736 --> 01:06:48.636
(ladies laughing)

01:07:35.552 --> 01:07:38.119
- I know you been
fucking the girls.

01:07:38.121 --> 01:07:39.821
Because you can't
even get it up.

01:07:40.957 --> 01:07:43.425
- I haven't been
fucking the girls.

01:07:43.427 --> 01:07:45.093
I'm just totally wasted.

01:07:46.196 --> 01:07:48.730
I'm been drinking and
doing blow for days.

01:07:48.732 --> 01:07:49.831
(Irene laughing)

01:07:49.833 --> 01:07:52.000
- Really, that's almost as bad.

01:07:54.538 --> 01:07:57.272
(body thudding)

01:07:59.142 --> 01:08:01.643
Your sweat smells
like rotting liquor.

01:08:02.746 --> 01:08:06.381
And kissing you is like
doing a line of coke.

01:08:06.383 --> 01:08:09.884
- Sometimes I think
about you and Blue Sky.

01:08:10.987 --> 01:08:13.922
How close were you
when you were kids?

01:08:19.429 --> 01:08:23.932
- We went to the same school
you know that, I just knew him.

01:08:23.934 --> 01:08:25.600
He was just a kid in my class.

01:08:27.170 --> 01:08:32.240
(skin smacking)
(Irene groaning)

01:08:54.631 --> 01:08:57.298
(man groaning)

01:08:58.835 --> 01:09:00.368
(computer thudding)

01:09:00.370 --> 01:09:02.036
(Irene sobbing)

01:09:02.037 --> 01:09:03.438
What did you do?

01:09:05.308 --> 01:09:08.209
You didn't stick it
in the right hole.

01:09:08.211 --> 01:09:11.045
That's what it takes
to turn you on.

01:09:11.046 --> 01:09:13.881
(dramatic music)

01:09:21.725 --> 01:09:23.691
Really, we loved each other.

01:09:24.961 --> 01:09:27.694
I just wished he
would die sometimes,

01:09:28.832 --> 01:09:31.666
but I heard that was
normal for lovers, die.

(dramatic music)

01:10:53.950 --> 01:10:57.819
- The man in black, he's
the train track killer.

01:11:04.327 --> 01:11:05.960
- [Gaven] You sure?

01:11:07.197 --> 01:11:08.396
- I'm completely sure.

01:11:09.733 --> 01:11:12.433
I'll never forget the
motherfuckers face.

01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:16.337
He was close enough for
me to smell his breath

01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:18.840
when Mandy got into this car.

01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:25.146
- He lives over there.

01:11:28.318 --> 01:11:29.517
You want me to go over there

01:11:29.519 --> 01:11:31.619
and fuck him up real
quick and leave?

01:11:32.989 --> 01:11:35.890
- If he invites you to go in
there right now and kill him.

01:11:37.227 --> 01:11:41.963
- Not so fast, let's go inside
and watch him for awhile.

01:11:42.499 --> 01:11:44.866
(upbeat music)

01:12:41.024 --> 01:12:43.858
- What's that
motherfucker doing?

01:12:59.342 --> 01:13:02.477
(upbeat dance music)

01:13:32.175 --> 01:13:33.975
- Erica and Mandy
wants to meet us.

01:13:38.348 --> 01:13:43.184
- Wow, there you go with
this Mandy stuff again.

01:13:43.186 --> 01:13:44.652
She's gone.

01:13:44.654 --> 01:13:49.524
- No, she's texting us
and here's some pictures.

01:13:50.693 --> 01:13:52.860
And Erica went to
meet her last night.

01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:56.264
- No, she didn't.

01:13:57.567 --> 01:13:59.000
- Yes, she did.

01:13:59.002 --> 01:14:02.136
- No she fucking didn't.

01:14:03.406 --> 01:14:05.306
- What's happening girls?

01:14:05.308 --> 01:14:07.708
You have to tell
me what's going on?

01:14:07.710 --> 01:14:10.144
- Mandy never stopped
posting pictures

01:14:10.146 --> 01:14:15.216
and messaging us, so Erica
went to meet her last night

01:14:16.352 --> 01:14:20.555
and they're together now
and they wanna meet up.

01:14:23.393 --> 01:14:26.461
- You girls are really not
that fucking stupid are you?

01:14:27.564 --> 01:14:29.397
Why don't you throw
yourself off the roof

01:14:29.399 --> 01:14:31.365
and see if you can fly.

01:14:31.367 --> 01:14:32.467
- Everyone chill out.

01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:36.037
Betsy, girls, sit down.

01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:43.478
We're gonna stick together,
we're gonna get through this.

01:14:45.181 --> 01:14:47.748
The Ripper is a hacker,
the girls are dead.

01:14:51.754 --> 01:14:54.322
He has their phones so
he knows your contacts

01:14:54.324 --> 01:14:56.524
and who knows what else.

01:14:58.161 --> 01:15:02.663
So, if you girls want to stay
alive, give me your phones,

01:15:02.665 --> 01:15:04.832
all of you, right now.

01:15:04.834 --> 01:15:07.468
- The smart one figures it out,

01:15:09.672 --> 01:15:10.571
too late.

01:15:12.342 --> 01:15:14.075
(dramatic music)

01:15:14.077 --> 01:15:16.911
(phones beeping)

01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:25.052
- You guys too.

01:15:56.786 --> 01:15:58.019
- Dirty bitch.

01:15:58.955 --> 01:16:02.089
(computers crashing)

01:16:04.093 --> 01:16:06.661
- [Irene] We all
partied every day

01:16:06.663 --> 01:16:09.196
like the world was
coming to an end.

01:16:10.199 --> 01:16:14.702
But I threw the parties,
I was the party.

01:16:15.838 --> 01:16:18.306
None of us could stop
breaking the law.

01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:25.680
Somehow everyone else
ended up paying my price.

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:36.958
- Knockout.

01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:38.192
- [Knockout] Hmm?

01:16:38.194 --> 01:16:39.460
- Let's build a gym
in my living room.

01:16:39.462 --> 01:16:42.096
- I'm down for that,
I love working out.

01:16:42.098 --> 01:16:43.664
- If you wanna workout together,

01:16:43.666 --> 01:16:46.534
just go to the gym
like normal faggots.

01:16:47.904 --> 01:16:50.438
- All we really need is a
few basic wench and things.

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:53.040
- That's true, and then
we can do blow and alcohol

01:16:53.042 --> 01:16:54.442
while we lift weights.

01:16:54.444 --> 01:16:56.978
Just mixing everything
together feels best.

01:16:56.980 --> 01:16:59.714
- That sounds like a
recipe for a heart attack.

01:16:59.716 --> 01:17:02.083
- See, I used to think
it was a bad idea,

01:17:02.085 --> 01:17:06.020
mixing drugs and exercise,
then I thought about it.

01:17:06.022 --> 01:17:07.254
Think about all the
thousands of people

01:17:07.256 --> 01:17:09.991
in the city right now,
dancing in the club,

01:17:09.993 --> 01:17:13.728
getting all sweaty,
they on alcohol

01:17:13.730 --> 01:17:15.396
and God knows what else.

01:17:16.566 --> 01:17:19.867
And dancing ain't
nothing but exercise.

01:17:24.641 --> 01:17:27.475
(dramatic music)

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:33.881
(engine revving)

01:17:38.588 --> 01:17:41.222
(guns cocking)

01:17:54.237 --> 01:17:56.971
(water lapping)

01:17:59.542 --> 01:18:02.109
(guns firing)

01:18:05.548 --> 01:18:08.149
(upbeat music)

01:18:15.191 --> 01:18:17.124
- Everyone was
supposed to be here.

01:18:18.628 --> 01:18:20.461
They're not answering
their phones.

01:18:21.798 --> 01:18:24.999
They probably just got high
and went back to the penthouse.

01:18:25.001 --> 01:18:30.071
- Kill me, please just kill me.

01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:34.642
- It's just alcohol
and ecstasy withdrawal.

01:18:35.912 --> 01:18:40.548
- Just kill me, kill me please.

01:18:42.251 --> 01:18:43.818
- You look beautiful.

01:18:47.256 --> 01:18:49.857
Drinking would help
you a little bit.

01:18:51.894 --> 01:18:54.462
If you got drunk you could
probably eat something.

01:18:56.599 --> 01:18:59.734
- Just kill me, kill
me please, please.

01:19:01.904 --> 01:19:04.371
- I thought you wanted
me to take you away.

01:19:06.409 --> 01:19:08.442
Now you just want me
to kill you instead.

01:19:11.047 --> 01:19:15.983
- Just do one or the
other as soon as possible.

01:19:15.985 --> 01:19:18.052
- We should leave
tomorrow by sundown.

01:19:39.208 --> 01:19:42.009
- You planned it and
you didn't tell me?

01:19:42.011 --> 01:19:45.346
- No, I planned it
and I'm telling you.

01:19:50.787 --> 01:19:52.686
Try drinking some champagne.

01:20:03.866 --> 01:20:04.698
(Tanya gagging)

01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:07.601
(vomit splashing)

01:20:11.307 --> 01:20:14.041
(girl groaning)

01:20:18.214 --> 01:20:20.347
- There's no, there's no,

01:20:25.721 --> 01:20:27.221
is this my blood?

01:20:33.129 --> 01:20:36.130
- There's something
that we can do.

01:20:55.751 --> 01:20:59.153
- Dude, you really shouldn't
fuck with my bullet wound.

01:20:59.155 --> 01:21:04.091
- Sorry man, just
get their phones.

01:21:15.838 --> 01:21:18.639
(women groaning)

01:21:26.449 --> 01:21:28.115
- Red told me to get your phone.

01:21:33.389 --> 01:21:35.756
Can you get your girl's
phone too, I got shot.

01:21:37.627 --> 01:21:38.692
- Stop, aww.

01:21:45.434 --> 01:21:46.600
There's so much blood.

01:21:56.779 --> 01:21:58.145
- [Gaven] There.

01:22:01.651 --> 01:22:03.651
- I'm sorry I can't save her.

01:22:03.653 --> 01:22:08.622
- Fuck, just do your best
to help the others, Jenny.

01:22:09.158 --> 01:22:11.492
(woman gurgling)

01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:22.970
- They killed me, the doctor
just said they killed me.

01:22:24.573 --> 01:22:25.472
Did they?

01:22:26.275 --> 01:22:27.741
- Just draw it out for us.

01:22:28.844 --> 01:22:29.743
- How?

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:33.714
- I don't care, just shoot them.

01:22:35.484 --> 01:22:36.450
- Are you serious?

01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:38.419
Like with a gun?

01:22:39.488 --> 01:22:40.988
Shoot a gun in here?

01:22:40.990 --> 01:22:43.724
- Just take the barry out

01:22:43.726 --> 01:22:45.826
and fucking step on
them or something.

01:22:47.363 --> 01:22:48.595
- Yeah, that makes sense.

01:22:51.334 --> 01:22:54.902
(woman breathing heavily)

01:23:03.112 --> 01:23:05.045
- Can you move your left arm?

01:23:05.047 --> 01:23:09.249
- Fucking hurts
doc, am I gonna die?

01:23:09.251 --> 01:23:11.752
- No bones broken,
you're pretty lucky here.

01:23:13.756 --> 01:23:16.023
- Betsy and Lisa
didn't get lucky.

01:23:17.293 --> 01:23:19.760
They got their whole
fucking heads blown in half.

01:23:19.762 --> 01:23:22.596
(dramatic music)

01:23:26.268 --> 01:23:28.035
- Kiss me, I'm dying.

01:23:31.474 --> 01:23:34.308
(woman groaning)

01:23:44.086 --> 01:23:45.986
- Am I totally fucked?

01:23:58.434 --> 01:24:01.168
- [Uncle] Here comes the bullet.

01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:10.411
Mom tie it, you
guys are hurting me.

01:24:10.413 --> 01:24:13.814
- We're not the ones
who hurt you sweetie,

01:24:13.816 --> 01:24:15.749
we're just taking care of you.

01:24:15.751 --> 01:24:17.584
Now hold still.

01:24:17.586 --> 01:24:20.554
- I think you have
a minor fracture.

01:24:20.556 --> 01:24:21.855
You might get it x-rayed,

01:24:21.857 --> 01:24:25.325
but there's nothing much
to do but let it heal.

01:24:27.530 --> 01:24:32.132
- I can't feel my leg, I can't
drink, give me some drugs.

01:24:36.639 --> 01:24:38.872
- It doesn't hurt anymore.

01:24:42.211 --> 01:24:45.179
I looked like I'll
let 'em die now.

01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:51.251
- That's good, that's good.

01:24:51.253 --> 01:24:53.253
Just let it go, just let it go.

01:24:53.255 --> 01:24:58.325
(woman coughing)
(woman gasping)

01:25:01.363 --> 01:25:04.598
- There was nothing
left to let go of.

01:25:06.802 --> 01:25:09.803
There's never any
reason to hold on.

01:25:15.978 --> 01:25:21.048
I guess, I'm just going to
grow feathers and fly away.

01:25:27.456 --> 01:25:28.388
- Do you see God?

01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:32.159
- No.

01:25:37.566 --> 01:25:38.532
- What do you see?

01:25:40.536 --> 01:25:42.669
- I don't know, the pain.

01:25:49.678 --> 01:25:51.478
I don't see anything.

01:25:59.021 --> 01:26:01.121
It doesn't feel bad.

01:26:01.122 --> 01:26:03.222
- You're almost dead, are
you already in heaven?

01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:07.361
- I don't know, I
don't see anything.

01:26:18.607 --> 01:26:19.773
Kiss me again.

01:26:21.544 --> 01:26:23.243
- You must see God or something.

01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:27.915
- No, only, only shadows.

01:26:37.359 --> 01:26:38.525
Just kiss me.

01:26:55.044 --> 01:26:58.412
(dramatic music)

01:26:58.414 --> 01:26:59.746
- Jenny.

01:27:04.987 --> 01:27:07.087
- [Irene] They died young.

01:27:07.089 --> 01:27:09.456
Their lives and
bodies were wasted.

01:27:10.793 --> 01:27:13.293
The blood of my girls
mixed in the gutters,

01:27:15.130 --> 01:27:18.031
at least they were
finally sisters.

01:27:19.668 --> 01:27:23.837
For weeks, I wished
that I would fall asleep

01:27:23.839 --> 01:27:26.807
and wake up in
some far away land.

01:27:35.451 --> 01:27:38.051
But of course I always
woke up in my bed.

01:27:51.333 --> 01:27:52.733
(Red Hot snorting)

01:27:52.735 --> 01:27:55.702
(Red Hot grunting)

01:28:18.127 --> 01:28:23.196
- You know we are being watched
by the Train Track Ripper.

01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:28.735
If you're a good pimp, The
Ripper would be dead right now.

01:28:28.737 --> 01:28:31.772
- You'll be dead
within 24 hours.

01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:37.544
The tax collectors
and the prostitutes

01:28:37.546 --> 01:28:40.147
will get into heaven before you.

01:28:43.085 --> 01:28:45.185
You'll be lucky if
you get there at all.

01:28:46.655 --> 01:28:50.757
- You basically are a
prostitute and a tax collector.

01:28:52.261 --> 01:28:54.294
You always have to
collect from people.

01:28:55.464 --> 01:29:00.534
And you are a man
whore, a prostidude.

01:29:06.375 --> 01:29:11.378
- If someone owes me money,
I go over to their house,

01:29:12.481 --> 01:29:15.582
kick down their door,
punch them in the face,

01:29:15.584 --> 01:29:18.719
and take their computer
and their jacket.

01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:30.330
- We're hot, we just got shot
twice, put the knife away.

01:29:35.304 --> 01:29:37.971
If you're having sex
with a prostitute,

01:29:37.973 --> 01:29:39.639
you become a prostitute.

01:29:40.943 --> 01:29:44.344
Because sex makes
two bodies one flesh.

01:29:48.283 --> 01:29:51.118
(chair thudding)

01:29:54.022 --> 01:29:55.789
- Did you ever fuck Blue Sky?

01:29:59.461 --> 01:30:01.862
(Irene sighing)

01:30:01.864 --> 01:30:04.030
Are you and him one body?

01:30:05.567 --> 01:30:07.033
Are you and him one flesh?

01:30:07.035 --> 01:30:09.169
- Red Hot, you're going crazy.

01:30:10.139 --> 01:30:12.672
I just knew him in grade school.

01:30:12.674 --> 01:30:14.775
I didn't have sex with
anybody back then.

01:30:14.777 --> 01:30:17.577
- You know I would
stab you in the leg

01:30:17.579 --> 01:30:20.881
in between the bullet
points and no one would know

01:30:20.883 --> 01:30:22.783
because you are limping already.

01:30:23.752 --> 01:30:26.086
- Why are you
threatening to stab me?

01:30:26.088 --> 01:30:27.788
I'm just laying here.

01:30:27.790 --> 01:30:31.858
- You don't understand why,
because you're an idiot

01:30:31.860 --> 01:30:34.327
just like everybody else.

01:30:34.329 --> 01:30:38.432
But these perfect
valid, scientific,

01:30:38.434 --> 01:30:41.468
fully acceptable reason
to shove my knife

01:30:41.470 --> 01:30:46.139
right into your thigh and
leave it there for a while.

01:30:47.810 --> 01:30:50.076
And watch you cry and bleed.

01:30:50.078 --> 01:30:52.479
- Can't you just fuck
me and we go to sleep?

01:30:54.650 --> 01:30:55.849
- Of course sweetheart.

01:30:59.288 --> 01:31:04.324
(flesh tearing)
(Irene screaming)

01:31:06.328 --> 01:31:07.561
- I thought you were joking!

01:31:07.563 --> 01:31:09.596
- Red Hot don't joke.

01:31:12.935 --> 01:31:16.269
(Irene groaning)

01:31:16.271 --> 01:31:17.704
(Red Hot groaning)

01:31:17.706 --> 01:31:19.005
- [Irene] Red Hot was starting

01:31:19.007 --> 01:31:21.675
to have dreams and
hallucinations.

01:31:23.111 --> 01:31:26.780
He would think that there
was someone at the door

01:31:26.782 --> 01:31:28.381
when no one was there.

01:31:29.151 --> 01:31:30.350
(dramatic music)

01:31:30.352 --> 01:31:33.186
Sometimes he would
see me and other women

01:31:33.188 --> 01:31:37.657
flying over him in his
sleep with feathers

01:31:37.659 --> 01:31:41.328
and flowing white robes,
caressing his face

01:31:41.330 --> 01:31:43.763
and chest with out fingertips.

01:31:45.100 --> 01:31:48.001
A lot of times he
would take cold showers

01:31:48.003 --> 01:31:50.237
in the middle of the night.

01:31:50.239 --> 01:31:53.707
Sometimes he would cry in
the shower or even vomit.

01:32:02.985 --> 01:32:05.752
(dramatic music)

01:32:57.639 --> 01:33:01.408
Finally it felt like
we had built a palace

01:33:01.410 --> 01:33:05.579
of loneliness and lies
for ourselves to live in.

01:33:07.282 --> 01:33:11.418
The only things that
I felt sad about

01:33:11.420 --> 01:33:15.388
were the times my girls
got hurt or killed.

01:33:15.390 --> 01:33:16.623
(girl screaming)

01:33:16.625 --> 01:33:20.126
When that would happen
I would turn to Red Hot

01:33:20.128 --> 01:33:21.561
and he would comfort me.

01:33:23.098 --> 01:33:25.999
But nothing could really
make me feel better.

01:33:31.073 --> 01:33:33.907
(birds chirping)

01:33:35.944 --> 01:33:39.412
- These are useless
now aren't they?

01:33:39.414 --> 01:33:41.481
- These are first class tickets.

01:33:42.818 --> 01:33:44.718
I just switched them
to a week later.

01:33:45.721 --> 01:33:47.954
It even ended up costing less.

01:33:48.890 --> 01:33:50.357
- Well maybe it cost less money,

01:33:50.359 --> 01:33:53.159
but now it could
cost us our lives.

01:33:54.396 --> 01:33:56.129
Isn't all that
warm now isn't it?

01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:01.668
- That's for sure.

01:34:01.670 --> 01:34:03.136
- What's gonna happen now?

01:34:08.644 --> 01:34:10.510
- We're gonna have
to kill Blue Sky.

01:34:14.116 --> 01:34:18.218
I wouldn't blame you if you
wanted me to help you disappear

01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:19.552
until this blows over.

01:34:21.823 --> 01:34:24.057
It's not gonna be
pretty for awhile.

01:34:28.597 --> 01:34:30.563
- Ice cream used
to make me throw up

01:34:30.565 --> 01:34:32.766
because it reminds
me of my childhood.

01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:39.506
My dad was such a crazy drunk
that he spent all his money

01:34:39.508 --> 01:34:42.175
on alcohol until one
day he couldn't afford

01:34:42.177 --> 01:34:43.977
to buy me an ice cream cone.

01:34:43.979 --> 01:34:45.412
(dramatic music)

01:34:45.414 --> 01:34:46.913
- That's nice, but--

01:34:46.915 --> 01:34:50.283
- It wasn't nice because
when his dad died

01:34:50.285 --> 01:34:53.086
he inherited enough money
to drink himself to death.

01:34:57.325 --> 01:35:00.927
The first time I had sex, it
might have even been with him.

01:35:05.267 --> 01:35:07.834
It was just like being
fucked by a cold shadow.

01:35:10.372 --> 01:35:14.641
I just remember lying in the
snow and one leg of my jeans

01:35:14.643 --> 01:35:18.078
was still on and I was
grabbing the stinking

01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:19.846
muscular guy on top of me.

01:35:21.917 --> 01:35:23.183
I don't know who he was.

01:35:26.722 --> 01:35:29.422
After my dad died, my
mom OD'd on methadone

01:35:29.424 --> 01:35:33.626
on Valentine's Day, so I
became a ward of the state.

01:35:35.497 --> 01:35:37.464
And at some point I
got sick of that shit,

01:35:37.466 --> 01:35:41.167
so I ran away, onto the
streets like a stray cat.

01:35:47.075 --> 01:35:48.374
- That's intense.

01:35:58.153 --> 01:36:01.054
(water splashing)

01:36:02.424 --> 01:36:04.791
- I'm not going into hiding
while you guys kill Blue Sky,

01:36:04.793 --> 01:36:07.026
but do you think
that if you really

01:36:07.028 --> 01:36:11.131
wanted to run away with me,
now would be a good time?

01:36:11.133 --> 01:36:13.299
- I just can't
disappear on Red Hot,

01:36:13.301 --> 01:36:15.835
without making sure
he's okay first.

01:36:15.837 --> 01:36:18.905
- Red Hot's not okay,
he's going crazy.

01:36:20.208 --> 01:36:22.142
And Blue Sky's more
dangerous than we thought.

01:36:26.014 --> 01:36:28.815
Will you lick the ice
cream off my face?

01:36:28.817 --> 01:36:31.651
(dramatic music)

01:36:45.901 --> 01:36:49.502
(guitar strumming)

01:36:49.504 --> 01:36:51.838
- Hey mister, mister.

01:36:55.477 --> 01:36:58.211
- I'm getting real fucking
tired of your pity.

01:37:00.382 --> 01:37:02.816
(body thudding)
(metal clanking)

01:37:02.818 --> 01:37:07.821
(Knockout grunting)
(dog whimpering)

01:37:13.094 --> 01:37:14.661
And fuck your dog.

01:37:17.866 --> 01:37:20.300
(wheels squealing)

01:37:20.302 --> 01:37:23.036
(body thudding)

01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:28.641
- [Irene] Sometimes I wish the
whole city would get nuked.

01:37:28.643 --> 01:37:31.711
(booming explosion)

01:37:32.948 --> 01:37:33.980
- Where's Knockout?

01:37:35.684 --> 01:37:38.718
- I don't know, he
didn't come in today

01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:40.153
like he usually does.

01:37:42.557 --> 01:37:44.691
- Are you sure you don't
want me to come with you man?

01:37:46.094 --> 01:37:49.295
- I finally found a way to
move all this shit at once

01:37:50.832 --> 01:37:53.366
and I can do it tonight.

01:37:53.368 --> 01:37:54.734
- It'll really
make me feel better

01:37:54.736 --> 01:37:56.302
if you waited for Knockout.

01:38:00.342 --> 01:38:01.241
Hey, hey.

01:38:02.110 --> 01:38:04.911
(dramatic music)

01:38:19.594 --> 01:38:20.426
Just watch your back.

01:38:20.428 --> 01:38:21.361

01:42:25.607 --> 01:42:30.543
- So there's a really, real
looking fake gun in my purse.

01:42:31.412 --> 01:42:32.378
- That's cool.

01:42:33.748 --> 01:42:35.481
- Take it out and
point it at me.

01:42:36.951 --> 01:42:37.850
- Why?

01:42:38.953 --> 01:42:40.586
- I don't know, we can
take some cool pictures

01:42:40.588 --> 01:42:42.755
and put them up
online or something.

01:42:42.757 --> 01:42:43.656
It'll be funny.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:55.268
- Wow, this does look real.

01:42:56.771 --> 01:42:57.670
- Check it out.

01:42:59.607 --> 01:43:01.040
I've got an old film camera,

01:43:02.310 --> 01:43:04.377
no psychos can track
us through this thing.

01:43:04.379 --> 01:43:07.980
(ladies chuckling)

01:43:07.982 --> 01:43:10.183
Why don't we try it
in our underwear?

01:43:12.554 --> 01:43:14.353
- Why don't we do it naked?

01:43:31.839 --> 01:43:34.807
(shutter clicking)

01:43:59.567 --> 01:44:01.167
- Now point the gun
right at my temple,

01:44:01.169 --> 01:44:02.568
like you're gonna shoot me.

01:44:06.074 --> 01:44:11.077
That's gonna look
great. (laughs)

01:44:13.781 --> 01:44:15.514
I can get a nice
wide shot from here.

01:44:15.516 --> 01:44:17.183
Point the gun right at the lens.

01:44:20.955 --> 01:44:21.854
That's perfect.

01:44:22.657 --> 01:44:24.857
Now, just put it in your mouth.

01:44:32.033 --> 01:44:35.167
And get back a bit, I wanna
get your tits in the shot.

01:44:37.372 --> 01:44:41.140
So gently squeeze the trigger
and I'll catch a picture

01:44:41.142 --> 01:44:43.709
just as it looks like you're
about to blow your brains out.

01:44:43.711 --> 01:44:44.610

01:46:39.694 --> 01:46:41.927
- All my friends are dead.

01:46:45.032 --> 01:46:46.832
My boyfriend is dead.

01:46:50.171 --> 01:46:52.671
Now Blue Sky's gonna
run the whole city.

01:46:52.673 --> 01:46:56.675
- Exactly, he runs the
whole city already.

01:46:58.846 --> 01:47:03.082
You know Blue Sky, he's
not gonna hurt you.

01:47:04.986 --> 01:47:07.686
- You have two choices now.

01:47:07.688 --> 01:47:11.056
Dinner with us or Blue Sky.

01:47:13.327 --> 01:47:17.797
- I can't decide,
I can't decide.

01:47:17.799 --> 01:47:20.399
- Then why haven't
you touched your food?

01:47:20.401 --> 01:47:23.469
- Mom I can't, I can't.

01:47:26.174 --> 01:47:29.241
All my friends died
and now you're saying

01:47:29.243 --> 01:47:33.012
that my only choice is to be
with the man who killed them.

01:47:34.615 --> 01:47:39.118
- Your choice is simple,
it's life or death.

01:47:42.190 --> 01:47:44.790
You and Blue Sky used
to like each other once.

01:47:46.894 --> 01:47:50.429
- What's the secret recipe for
the food that kills people?

01:47:51.265 --> 01:47:52.998
(mom sighing)

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:56.402
- There is no secret,
you just make food

01:47:58.606 --> 01:48:00.606
and put the poison in it.

01:48:00.608 --> 01:48:02.908
Go to Blue Sky.

01:48:02.910 --> 01:48:07.947
- Okay, I'll go
back to Blue Sky.

01:48:30.238 --> 01:48:34.874
