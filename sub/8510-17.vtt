00:08.508 --> 00:09.466
Mom!

00:09.551 --> 00:11.468
Riko!

01:11.237 --> 01:14.073
When a rain shower arrives it‘s sunrise

01:14.157 --> 01:16.909
Frogs croak in the stylishly hazy city

01:16.993 --> 01:22.039
If it‘ll make exquisite rainbow
sounds sometimes, pick up mystic

02:04.290 --> 02:06.625
Nothing at all.

02:06.709 --> 02:08.794
Riko!

02:11.172 --> 02:14.174
Umm, Mom. The chopsticks...

02:14.259 --> 02:17.427
Oh, sorry!

03:57.862 --> 04:00.155
A cop?

04:00.240 --> 04:04.743
Well, I guess that's alright. But...

04:06.454 --> 04:09.206
Look. I'm sitting on a ton of stories here,

10:32.757 --> 10:39.721
You were perfect. As a person,
as a scholar, as a father...

10:39.805 --> 10:46.853
But you made one mistake.
Choosing the mother to have me...

11:07.375 --> 11:10.168
Furumizu Tatsuoki...

11:10.252 --> 11:11.795
Man, what a history...

11:11.879 --> 11:19.052
Raised as a real rich kid, plus
he's damn smart. Pretty disturbing.

14:13.519 --> 14:16.062
--Dust.
--Thank you.

14:16.146 --> 14:17.647
Not at all!

14:21.193 --> 14:26.906
Wadou-kun's Bio-Section has a report
today, so let us begin with that.

16:28.946 --> 16:30.822
W-What?!

16:30.906 --> 16:33.783
You don't mean... Baradhi
wasn't planning to buy Ultimates?!

16:33.867 --> 16:36.786
They did say they were merely considering it.

16:36.870 --> 16:41.708
Wadou-san, have you even
been to a battlefield before?

19:59.990 --> 20:04.869
I'm Riko's mother, you know!
What's wrong with holding her dear?!

23:12.182 --> 23:16.060
Riko, there's no need
to worry ever again!

23:16.144 --> 23:20.773
i'm going to keep working lots,
and earn lots of money!

23:20.857 --> 23:26.112
You‘d be so shocked if you
saw how much we have saved up!

23:26.196 --> 23:27.405
Wanna see?

23:27.489 --> 23:29.740
Too bad! It‘s still a secret!

23:29.825 --> 23:33.119
Instead, I‘ll buy you lots of clothes!

23:33.203 --> 23:35.830
And we can go anywhere you want!

23:35.914 --> 23:39.500
I‘d do anything for you, Riko.
