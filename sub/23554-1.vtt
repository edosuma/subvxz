00:37.792 --> 00:39.750
The first study of Qimen and Dunjia

00:39.917 --> 00:42.042
was found in the annals of
unofficial Chinese history.

00:42.250 --> 00:44.208
It's a very ancient text, so it's impossible

00:44.375 --> 00:46.667
to determine which parts of it may be true.

00:47.625 --> 00:48.917
Nowadays, 'Qimen'

00:49.000 --> 00:51.542
is taken to mean 'time' and 'coordinates.'

00:51.625 --> 00:53.417
It's used to boost luck and avoid misfortune.

00:54.125 --> 00:55.208
Whereas 'Dunjia,'

00:55.458 --> 00:56.917
as far as I can tell,

00:57.167 --> 00:59.792
is hidden inside an orb device called Qimen.

00:59.875 --> 01:01.500
It contains the limitless power of the universe.

01:02.708 --> 01:04.583
Even if separated by a great distance,

01:04.958 --> 01:06.375
these two natural opposites are infinitely linked.

01:06.583 --> 01:08.667
They form a causal circle.

01:19.042 --> 01:21.667
We members of the Wuyin Clan must spare no effort

01:21.750 --> 01:24.208
to locate the Dunjia device.

01:24.292 --> 01:25.917
The enemies from beyond the sky must be beaten.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.250
Peace and order must be restored to the earth.

02:15.292 --> 02:17.375
KAIFENG POLICE DETECTIVE BUREAU

02:25.542 --> 02:27.000
Place your bets!

02:27.083 --> 02:28.458
He can lift it.

02:28.542 --> 02:29.833
Or he can't.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.042
I bet he can't!

02:31.125 --> 02:33.542
He's not that strong! It's ridiculous!

02:36.458 --> 02:38.292
Keep your hands away!

02:44.167 --> 02:49.375
CHAPTER 1: NO TRUTH ON EARTH

02:52.375 --> 02:53.208
Sir...

02:54.125 --> 02:55.500
This is the new constable.

02:55.583 --> 02:56.792
He's just reported for duty.

02:57.042 --> 02:58.500
His name's Dao Yichang.

02:59.458 --> 03:02.625
Show us your strength!

03:09.917 --> 03:11.292
He's a tough one.

03:11.625 --> 03:13.458
He'll cramp our style if he's in here.

03:18.625 --> 03:20.333
Sketch some fake wanted posters

03:20.875 --> 03:22.458
and send him out to look for the crims.

03:22.542 --> 03:24.375
If he doesn't catch 'em, he can't come back.

03:25.083 --> 03:26.458
Good plan!

03:27.292 --> 03:29.708
How much did you lose?

03:29.792 --> 03:31.667
I wasn't playing...

03:31.750 --> 03:34.042
He's here to make trouble.

03:37.125 --> 03:38.000
We won big today!

03:38.083 --> 03:39.250
Lucky that I just managed

03:39.333 --> 03:40.500
to fix that chain under the stone.

03:40.583 --> 03:42.000
If I hadn't, we'd have lost big time.

03:42.083 --> 03:43.250
Don't mention it, take these.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.542
We can't use these the same way anymore.

03:47.042 --> 03:47.667
See you later.

03:47.833 --> 03:48.958
Okay, see you at the Three Lives Pavilion!

03:48.958 --> 03:50.542
I'll heat up the wine and wait for you there.

04:27.042 --> 04:29.250
DIRECTED BY YUEN WO PING

04:35.000 --> 04:36.625
Come on, look at these sketches.

04:36.708 --> 04:37.792
3 iron coins, sir.

04:37.875 --> 04:38.750
Here you are.

04:38.833 --> 04:39.708
Thank you.

04:39.875 --> 04:41.500
Bossâ€œ.

04:41.500 --> 04:42.792
Take a look at these sketches.

04:42.875 --> 04:44.917
Seen any of these people?

04:45.125 --> 04:45.792
This one?

04:45.792 --> 04:46.417
Take a look.

04:46.500 --> 04:48.000
He's hopeless!

04:48.000 --> 04:49.833
You must be the stupid new constable.

04:50.667 --> 04:52.375
You take these sketches seriously?

04:53.292 --> 04:54.500
You haven't even looked at them!

04:55.792 --> 04:57.000
You don't look great at all.

04:57.083 --> 04:58.667
If you were in this rogues' gallery,

04:58.750 --> 05:00.625
you'd be the first one I'd arrest!

05:01.375 --> 05:02.458
You're not thinking straight!

05:02.542 --> 05:03.625
At sixes and sevens!

05:05.375 --> 05:08.042
Can't you see these are random sketches?

05:08.542 --> 05:09.542
Take this one...

05:09.625 --> 05:11.083
Isn't it that black dog?

05:11.625 --> 05:12.750
And this one...

05:12.750 --> 05:14.042
Isn't it him?

05:14.458 --> 05:15.208
The silly kid?

05:18.167 --> 05:19.250
Your spit...

05:19.792 --> 05:20.833
...is getting into the bean curd.

05:21.333 --> 05:22.875
Disgusting! Who'll eat that?

05:23.208 --> 05:23.958
You want it if it's free?

05:24.333 --> 05:24.958
Sure!

05:32.458 --> 05:33.292
He's on the list!

06:11.375 --> 06:12.125
Make Way!

06:15.583 --> 06:16.417
Innkeeper!

06:16.417 --> 06:18.167
I want your biggest room!

06:18.167 --> 06:19.542
The biggest and cheapest one!

06:20.250 --> 06:21.792
Is there even such a deal?

06:24.042 --> 06:26.625
We have house rules...

06:26.625 --> 06:29.792
No pets allowed in the inn.

06:31.667 --> 06:34.375
"No pets allowed in the inn"?

06:34.458 --> 06:35.542
That's six words!

06:36.000 --> 06:38.333
But there are eight written there! You cheat!

06:39.500 --> 06:40.708
We're all educated people.

06:40.792 --> 06:42.000
Why would we cheat anyone?

06:42.500 --> 06:43.333
Look.

06:43.417 --> 06:45.083
"Pets are not allowed."

06:45.167 --> 06:47.167
"And especially not fish!"

06:47.833 --> 06:49.708
Eight words, right?

06:50.125 --> 06:52.083
Go someplace else! Get out!

06:52.167 --> 06:53.625
You're throwing me out?

06:53.708 --> 06:55.417
Since you don't allow pets...

06:56.083 --> 06:57.833
Fine! I'll just eat mine!

06:58.042 --> 06:59.292
Is that okay?

07:00.583 --> 07:01.792
Splendid! Splendid!

07:03.125 --> 07:06.667
For the first time
I'll get to see a guest eat their pet.

07:06.750 --> 07:09.750
Go right ahead, show me!

07:09.958 --> 07:11.292
You're forcing me!

07:12.042 --> 07:13.250
Really forcing me!

07:13.333 --> 07:15.708
Okay, I'll eat it!

07:16.583 --> 07:18.125
I'm eating it!

07:26.792 --> 07:28.458
Give me a room!

07:28.750 --> 07:29.625
I'm not your pet!

07:29.708 --> 07:30.708
I'm eating it!

07:31.250 --> 07:32.292
Give me one now!

07:34.833 --> 07:35.917
Don't make any trouble!

07:37.625 --> 07:39.000
Give me a room!

07:39.208 --> 07:40.125
Give it to me!

07:41.083 --> 07:42.042
I want my room!

07:43.375 --> 07:44.833
Damn fish, don't move!

07:59.917 --> 08:01.167
Hey, Auntie.

08:01.250 --> 08:02.625
Thanks for your assistance.

08:03.208 --> 08:04.125
However,

08:04.208 --> 08:05.292
whether he's a man or a fish...

08:05.833 --> 08:06.708
If he did something illegal,

08:06.792 --> 08:08.542
he must be arrested.

08:09.792 --> 08:10.792
That's absurd!

08:11.292 --> 08:12.292
How can you arrest it?

08:29.792 --> 08:30.667
Stop!

08:37.250 --> 08:38.582
Is that a fish?

08:39.250 --> 08:41.042
Could be a red carp, a green carp, or a donkey...

08:42.750 --> 08:43.792
Forget everything!

08:55.792 --> 08:56.833
A carp!

09:23.167 --> 09:25.250
THREE LIVES PAVILION

09:25.875 --> 09:27.167
Two days from now I'll leave for Hangzhou.

09:27.167 --> 09:28.292
Please tell your Mama-San...

09:28.292 --> 09:29.375
I want you to come with me.

09:29.583 --> 09:30.167
All right?

09:30.167 --> 09:30.917
Okay.

09:33.583 --> 09:34.750
Sir...

09:35.208 --> 09:37.042
Will you come again tonight?

09:38.625 --> 09:39.750
Why are you hiding?

09:39.833 --> 09:40.792
I'm not!

09:42.500 --> 09:44.375
I was passing the toilet so I took a leak!

09:44.458 --> 09:45.250
Lies! Don't run!

09:49.917 --> 09:51.458
Why would I lie about taking a leak?

09:53.500 --> 09:54.917
You're a Taoist monk!

09:56.292 --> 09:57.500
You again?

09:57.750 --> 09:58.750
Why are you stalking me?

09:58.833 --> 10:01.083
Stalking you? Who do you think you are?

10:04.708 --> 10:05.458
A girl!

10:06.125 --> 10:06.833
Excuse me!

10:07.375 --> 10:09.208
We haven't met, right?

10:10.000 --> 10:11.250
Of course not!

10:12.958 --> 10:13.917
But you've come on to me!

10:15.792 --> 10:17.333
Stop playing tricks.

10:18.375 --> 10:18.958
You...

10:31.583 --> 10:34.167
I'm a constable, working on a case.

10:35.667 --> 10:36.875
And you're a very skillful woman!

10:37.292 --> 10:38.583
Don't try to flatter me.

10:38.667 --> 10:39.917
Aren't you hereto catch that fish?

10:40.250 --> 10:41.375
Where is it?

10:42.667 --> 10:43.917
It's gone upstairs.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.042
I was just chasing it, but you got in my way!

10:46.125 --> 10:47.958
Shit! Jiaojiao must be in danger!

10:50.958 --> 10:52.958
Jiaojiao, are you all right?

10:53.667 --> 10:54.958
So you're a regular here.

10:59.875 --> 11:00.417
Jiaojiao!

11:01.375 --> 11:03.417
You left this morning and you're back already!

11:03.500 --> 11:04.500
May we expect you this evening too?

11:04.583 --> 11:06.083
Have you seen anything strange?

11:06.625 --> 11:08.250
Aren't you something strange?

11:08.250 --> 11:09.917
Popping in and out all day?

11:10.000 --> 11:11.500
You think we're at a loose end here?

11:12.125 --> 11:13.083
Who's Jiaojiao?

11:15.042 --> 11:16.042
Oh, so it's you!

11:16.125 --> 11:17.500
When did you change your name, Nose Hair?

11:17.583 --> 11:18.417
Nose Hair?

11:18.917 --> 11:20.833
A threesome? That'll cost extra.

11:21.458 --> 11:22.375
Extra?

11:22.458 --> 11:23.708
We've never talked about money, have we?

11:24.125 --> 11:25.250
So you're also a regular here.

11:25.750 --> 11:27.333
If I weren't, she wouldn't survive.

11:27.625 --> 11:29.208
She has a huge appetite, wants everything,

11:29.417 --> 11:31.375
doesn't listen, and doesn't mind who's paying.

11:33.292 --> 11:34.167
Don't try to fool me.

11:34.250 --> 11:35.792
Or I let him see how ugly you really are!

11:36.333 --> 11:37.083
Ugly?

11:38.208 --> 11:39.375
Ask her where the fish is.

11:40.500 --> 11:41.875
She has nothing to do with the fish!

11:42.000 --> 11:43.208
Really? Then why are you here?

11:44.333 --> 11:44.750
Jiaojiao!

11:49.250 --> 11:50.167
Don't panic! I'm here!

11:51.167 --> 11:52.042
Why so heavy?

11:55.208 --> 11:56.083
Where's the fish?

11:57.250 --> 11:58.417
What damn fish?

11:58.500 --> 11:59.375
Jiaojiao!

11:59.458 --> 12:01.042
Save her first! The fish comes second!

12:01.208 --> 12:01.833
Speak up!

12:01.917 --> 12:02.958
She's almost dead!

12:02.958 --> 12:04.500
How can you let her die?

12:07.625 --> 12:09.000
Nose Hair, why are you pretending to faint?

12:10.250 --> 12:11.125
Why are you howling?

12:11.625 --> 12:13.458
I thought you were broken-hearted just now?

12:14.875 --> 12:16.042
Officer Dao...

12:16.125 --> 12:17.833
If you don't pull me up now,

12:17.917 --> 12:19.500
you won't be able to see me later tonight!

12:19.583 --> 12:20.458
I dare not come here again!

13:17.667 --> 13:19.500
You look so very different...

13:19.583 --> 13:22.250
...with and without make-up.

13:23.083 --> 13:24.375
I'm finished!

13:24.458 --> 13:26.125
Mirror! Mirror!

13:30.667 --> 13:32.042
That face of mine!

13:32.125 --> 13:34.958
It'll take ages to get it back!

13:39.083 --> 13:40.500
Where did this painting come from?

13:41.542 --> 13:42.917
Why haven't I seen it before?

13:45.083 --> 13:47.292
Isn't it 'Upstream at Qingming Festival'?

13:47.500 --> 13:49.083
What's wrong with it?

13:52.667 --> 13:53.500
Speak up!

13:53.583 --> 13:54.708
I'll tell you, I'll tell you!

13:55.042 --> 13:56.625
The fish brought it here.

13:56.708 --> 13:58.083
Told us to keep it for a few days.

13:58.167 --> 13:59.375
Someone's supposed to come for it!

13:59.458 --> 14:00.583
Who?

14:00.583 --> 14:02.125
Someone important...

14:02.208 --> 14:04.208
That's all I know!

14:06.208 --> 14:09.833
I really don't know anything!

14:09.917 --> 14:12.000
What do you want?

14:12.083 --> 14:13.833
Fine...

14:13.917 --> 14:15.000
Then I'll take the painting with me.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.042
No,no,no!

14:16.125 --> 14:17.750
If you take it, I'm done for!

14:17.833 --> 14:19.125
I'll bring it back in two hours.

14:22.250 --> 14:23.833
Okay then, take it.

14:23.917 --> 14:25.667
Just two hours, okay?

14:26.333 --> 14:27.750
What's the problem?

14:27.833 --> 14:30.417
The police should impound the evidence.

14:31.583 --> 14:32.417
It's a trifle.

14:36.083 --> 14:37.208
He's awake.

14:39.458 --> 14:40.583
Bossâ€œ.

14:40.708 --> 14:42.542
Have you seen the people in these sketches?

14:43.167 --> 14:44.250
Sir.

14:44.333 --> 14:45.917
You've asked me that already.

14:46.958 --> 14:48.625
Yes, I think you're right...

14:49.750 --> 14:51.542
Did I just fall asleep?

14:51.792 --> 14:52.333
Sir...

14:52.750 --> 14:54.167
You dozed off here while on duty,

14:54.250 --> 14:55.208
but you forgot already?

14:55.292 --> 14:56.625
Can you even remember your own name?

14:57.542 --> 14:58.375
You...

14:59.292 --> 15:00.417
Thank you for your business!

15:00.625 --> 15:02.792
As you requested, 200 sesame-seed buns.

15:03.875 --> 15:05.292
I didn't order those!

15:05.500 --> 15:06.500
You're forgetting again?

15:06.583 --> 15:07.417
Are you serious?

15:07.500 --> 15:08.917
Everyone here heard you order them.

15:08.958 --> 15:09.583
You...

15:09.667 --> 15:11.125
That'll be 35 copper coins.

15:11.208 --> 15:12.250
That's outrageous!

15:12.583 --> 15:14.958
You showed up early with your sketches.

15:15.042 --> 15:17.625
Then you nodded off and slept until sunset.

15:18.333 --> 15:20.667
I ask you to pay for the 200 buns you ordered...

15:20.958 --> 15:23.292
This new guy is so gullible.

15:23.292 --> 15:24.625
What's wrong with you constables these days?

15:24.708 --> 15:25.708
Your memory is like a sieve!

15:26.375 --> 15:27.875
How can you crack any cases?

15:28.167 --> 15:30.792
CHAPTER 2: THE WUYIN CLAN IN PERIL

15:30.875 --> 15:33.208
We of the Wuyin Clan

15:35.625 --> 15:37.583
Study Yin and Yang,

15:37.667 --> 15:39.333
the heavens and the earth,

15:39.708 --> 15:41.583
to protect mankind

15:41.667 --> 15:45.458
while leaving no trace behind.

15:51.500 --> 15:52.458
This painting 'Upstream at Qingming Festival'

15:52.542 --> 15:54.083
is based on the actual topography of Kaifeng,
the capital.

15:54.708 --> 15:56.833
But the two huts by the river don't exist in reality.

15:57.542 --> 15:59.167
The left side of the painting is missing.

15:59.250 --> 16:00.292
There should be more of it.

16:02.167 --> 16:03.958
Who told you to make so many copies?

16:04.042 --> 16:05.167
You said eleven, didn't you?

16:05.250 --> 16:07.417
Just one, just one.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.708
"Just one," not "eleven"?

16:12.542 --> 16:13.750
He's looking at the fish again.

16:32.417 --> 16:36.292
You've fallen into someone's trap.

16:38.333 --> 16:39.333
Brother...

16:45.417 --> 16:46.292
Something's wrong.

16:46.583 --> 16:47.750
It's a trap.

16:48.083 --> 16:50.458
The creatures who want to crush Wuyin are back!

16:50.958 --> 16:52.708
That fish wanted you to catch it.

16:52.875 --> 16:53.792
But Why?

16:53.875 --> 16:55.667
They want to track us to our secret base.

16:56.333 --> 16:58.625
I've never come across such a strong aura.

16:58.708 --> 17:00.708
The creatures that sent the fish are very strong.

17:01.375 --> 17:02.917
They can now sense

17:03.000 --> 17:04.458
where it's being held.

17:06.583 --> 17:07.541
Such a coincidence!

17:08.250 --> 17:09.750
Our earthquake sensor is showing a reading.

17:19.250 --> 17:20.625
They're moving fast!

17:21.625 --> 17:22.666
It's them?

18:00.125 --> 18:01.875
We thought the fire in the sky two days ago

18:01.958 --> 18:03.333
might have been related to the creatures.

18:03.792 --> 18:06.292
But we didn't expect them to be faster than us.

18:06.375 --> 18:08.542
We haven't yet located them,

18:08.625 --> 18:10.708
but they've already found us.

18:11.583 --> 18:14.042
We have one hour to move our base.

18:14.708 --> 18:15.500
And Big Brother?

18:15.583 --> 18:17.833
He's already on his way to Luoyang.

18:17.917 --> 18:21.208
We need to find a way
to defeat these strong enemies.

18:21.917 --> 18:24.000
Although we're already following
the Qimen coordinates

18:24.083 --> 18:25.875
to find the powerful Dunjia device,

18:26.292 --> 18:27.625
it still requires great powers

18:27.708 --> 18:29.000
to activate the device in the first place.

18:29.417 --> 18:31.208
So our late leader ordered Second Brother

18:31.292 --> 18:33.958
to continue his search for the right person

18:35.083 --> 18:37.875
who will find the Dunjia device and open it.

18:38.292 --> 18:39.167
However,

18:40.208 --> 18:41.292
There's no news from him yet.

18:41.375 --> 18:44.750
It seems that the Wuyin Clan
is no match for these creatures.

18:45.333 --> 18:46.125
So...

18:46.292 --> 18:49.375
We need to find the Great Fortune-teller,
the master of weaponry.

18:49.667 --> 18:52.333
In a Luoyang teahouse, he bought a box

18:52.833 --> 18:54.875
inscribed with the names of weapons.

18:55.375 --> 18:58.500
It was the divine instrument of legend...

18:59.333 --> 19:02.125
...the Destroyer of Worlds.

19:03.083 --> 19:06.542
It might help us fight our enemies here.

19:08.417 --> 19:09.917
This secret must remain secure,

19:10.000 --> 19:11.208
so we must use some codes.

19:32.042 --> 19:34.417
Pangolin, Ghost, Goldfinger.

19:38.458 --> 19:41.792
Head for the North-east area.

19:41.958 --> 19:43.417
We will store our clan treasures temporarily

19:43.500 --> 19:45.333
at the Tengshe

19:45.500 --> 19:47.542
and Taiyin coordinates.

19:49.250 --> 19:50.208
Far Sight, Sharp Ears.

19:55.542 --> 19:58.417
Keep our communications private.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.542
Thunderbolt, Lightning Bolt and myself...

20:02.500 --> 20:04.667
The fish stays here.

20:04.875 --> 20:07.875
We need to divert their attention.

20:08.958 --> 20:10.125
Sun is the mark, moon is the sign.

20:10.125 --> 20:12.292
Cloud begets wind, thunder begets lightning.

20:18.917 --> 20:20.583
This code is for Second Brother?

20:21.125 --> 20:21.875
Right.

20:22.125 --> 20:24.083
If he can find our new leader,

20:24.167 --> 20:25.958
he'll know where we are when he returns.

20:31.500 --> 20:33.875
JINGSHI HALL

20:33.958 --> 20:35.625
THE WORLD'S FOREMOST CLINIC

20:35.708 --> 20:39.500
The coordinate above Zhifu and below Jingmen...

20:39.583 --> 20:40.833
This is it.

20:42.958 --> 20:45.875
CHAPTER 3: QIMEN IN SEARCH OF DUNJIA

20:46.208 --> 20:54.708
CHANG-AN CITY

20:56.083 --> 20:59.250
Jingshi Hall is the foremost clinic in Chang-an.

20:59.333 --> 21:00.917
Come back when you have enough money.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.125
Next!

21:03.875 --> 21:06.917
If my calculations are correct...

21:07.000 --> 21:08.292
...it's here!

21:12.375 --> 21:13.667
ENTRANCE EXAM REGISTRATION

21:13.917 --> 21:16.375
Look! A blind man has come to apply!

21:18.458 --> 21:20.000
Hey, blind man...

21:20.208 --> 21:21.292
Are you here for the exam?

21:22.167 --> 21:23.583
Don't waste time looking around.

21:24.250 --> 21:25.667
Pay first, chop chop!

21:26.208 --> 21:28.292
Quick! Over here!

21:30.708 --> 21:31.500
What are you doing?

21:31.583 --> 21:33.000
You really can't see, can you?

21:33.750 --> 21:34.792
Excuse me...

21:34.875 --> 21:36.125
Is this the exam place?

21:36.208 --> 21:37.292
What do you think?

21:37.375 --> 21:38.333
Why else are you here?

21:38.542 --> 21:40.083
I've come to study medicine.

21:40.167 --> 21:41.833
But you're blind as a bat!

21:41.917 --> 21:43.667
How can you study medicine?

21:45.042 --> 21:46.250
That's what they all say.

21:46.375 --> 21:47.583
But so what?

21:47.667 --> 21:48.958
No harm in trying, is there?

21:49.708 --> 21:51.792
Try what? You know what we test?

21:52.417 --> 21:54.125
It's just a test, right?

21:54.208 --> 21:54.875
By the way...

21:55.125 --> 21:57.250
I'm familiar with the 'Materia Medicum,'

21:57.333 --> 21:58.500
'Principles and Species of Roots and Herbs,'

21:58.583 --> 21:59.542
'The Theory of Meridians and Channels,'

21:59.625 --> 22:00.708
'The Emperor's Internal Medicine,'

22:00.792 --> 22:03.542
'The Emperor's Surgery,' 'Four Medical Tantras,'

22:03.625 --> 22:05.208
'On Typhoid Fever,'

22:05.292 --> 22:06.250
'The Miscellany of Medical Knowledge,'

22:06.250 --> 22:07.208
'Spleen and Stomach Studies,'

22:07.292 --> 22:08.125
'Priceless Prescriptions,'

22:08.208 --> 22:09.708
and the 'Peace and Tranquillity' canon.

22:09.792 --> 22:11.125
I've memorized them all.

22:11.583 --> 22:14.167
And I've recently written four books

22:14.167 --> 22:15.250
on medical sciences.

22:15.333 --> 22:18.083
I'm now working on making pills
from medicinal soups.

22:18.167 --> 22:19.958
In that case, brother, what is your name?

22:22.042 --> 22:23.417
My goodness!

22:23.708 --> 22:24.917
I say, Director...

22:25.750 --> 22:27.417
You're accepting blind pupils?

22:27.667 --> 22:28.875
If you believe all he says

22:28.958 --> 22:30.250
you're just as blind as he is!

22:30.708 --> 22:31.792
Principal...

22:31.875 --> 22:33.583
Look at his name!

22:35.625 --> 22:36.292
See?

22:36.958 --> 22:38.208
Zhuge Qing?

22:38.917 --> 22:39.792
He's a Zhuge!

22:39.875 --> 22:40.708
Right!

22:40.792 --> 22:42.625
Everyone in Chang-an knows

22:42.708 --> 22:45.375
that the Zhuge family is our sworn enemy.

22:45.708 --> 22:46.833
They're known for sending people to our clinic

22:46.917 --> 22:48.917
to steal our knowledge.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.375
Now that this Zhuge has arrived here

22:51.458 --> 22:52.750
it calls for stalling tactics.

22:52.833 --> 22:53.833
I'll keep him here.

22:53.917 --> 22:55.542
You find a way to deal with him.

22:55.625 --> 22:56.958
It's impossible!

22:57.042 --> 22:58.667
How could they send a blind man here?

22:58.750 --> 22:59.542
Principal...

22:59.625 --> 23:01.458
It doesn't matter if they sent him or not.

23:01.542 --> 23:03.500
We just need them to know

23:03.583 --> 23:06.167
that no Zhuge can escape our operations!

23:09.542 --> 23:10.250
Move!

23:10.833 --> 23:11.583
Kneel!

23:12.500 --> 23:14.375
What operations?

23:14.458 --> 23:15.917
Please explain.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.667
Or maybe I can give you advice.

23:17.917 --> 23:19.958
Good. Those standing beside you

23:20.042 --> 23:21.958
are the senior doctors

23:22.042 --> 23:24.917
specializing in limb and organ transplants.

23:25.333 --> 23:28.708
We're assembling a human from the parts of others

23:28.792 --> 23:30.292
to see what might result.

23:31.458 --> 23:33.167
That's a pointless exercise!

23:34.000 --> 23:36.500
I know a lot about that.

23:36.583 --> 23:37.375
Lookâ€œ.

23:40.125 --> 23:42.125
I've made this case study.

23:42.875 --> 23:43.917
It's upside-down!

23:45.458 --> 23:46.667
The woman you see here

23:46.750 --> 23:48.000
didn't have the strength to truss a chicken

23:48.375 --> 23:49.750
After I operated on her,

23:49.833 --> 23:51.417
she could not only do housework with one hand

23:51.667 --> 23:54.583
but also lift ten men with the other!

23:55.583 --> 23:57.583
And look at this man...

23:57.667 --> 23:59.333
That's a drawing, it proves nothing!

23:59.375 --> 24:00.375
The man has four legs!

24:00.375 --> 24:01.500
Does he even look human?

24:01.500 --> 24:02.875
You're having us on!

24:05.125 --> 24:07.125
And these guys look like senior doctors?

24:08.542 --> 24:09.500
He's not blind!

24:09.792 --> 24:11.000
Take off his dark glasses!

24:13.917 --> 24:15.417
Let's continue this.

24:16.875 --> 24:18.458
Stick to the point.

24:18.542 --> 24:20.292
Can you really transform people like that?

24:20.375 --> 24:21.458
I've never failed.

24:21.833 --> 24:24.208
Ask a teacher to volunteer. I'll show you.

24:24.833 --> 24:26.208
And if you fail?

24:26.500 --> 24:28.042
If I fail, bury him

24:28.625 --> 24:29.750
and call the police to arrest me.

24:34.417 --> 24:36.750
Do you know why this place

24:36.833 --> 24:39.083
is named Jingshi Hall?

24:39.167 --> 24:40.375
They say...

24:40.458 --> 24:41.917
It's because your clinic

24:42.000 --> 24:44.083
has many patients with weird illnesses.

24:45.417 --> 24:48.083
If you can cure just one of them,

24:48.167 --> 24:49.542
I'll take you on as a student.

24:49.625 --> 24:51.083
You'll be officially enrolled

24:51.792 --> 24:53.042
That's wonderful, Principal!

24:53.125 --> 24:54.917
That's more than reasonable!

24:55.000 --> 24:56.792
But if you should fail,

24:56.875 --> 24:59.208
I will experiment the transplant on you!

25:01.542 --> 25:02.708
Please give me a patient.

25:04.333 --> 25:05.417
Choose one yourself.

25:07.750 --> 25:09.125
Where's the room with patients?

25:09.208 --> 25:10.125
Are we there yet?

25:12.917 --> 25:14.083
He can't see a thing!

25:14.167 --> 25:15.167
How can he choose a patient?

25:15.250 --> 25:16.083
Mind the wall!

25:18.917 --> 25:20.000
Which room do you want to go into?

25:20.208 --> 25:21.083
Straight ahead.

25:24.292 --> 25:25.417
Mind the steps on your way down.

25:26.542 --> 25:27.292
We're here.

25:29.500 --> 25:30.833
Out of the way!

25:37.125 --> 25:39.167
Here, take the key.

25:39.250 --> 25:40.417
Go on in.

25:55.667 --> 25:56.833
Poor guy.

25:56.917 --> 25:59.250
Why did he choose that room?

25:59.333 --> 26:00.917
Nobody who's gone in there

26:00.917 --> 26:03.833
has ever come out alive!

26:03.917 --> 26:05.583
Nobody has ever seen her as a patient.

26:05.667 --> 26:08.292
Even the maids won't go in there.

26:40.958 --> 26:42.000
Who are you looking for?

26:42.083 --> 26:43.167
There's no one else here,

26:43.500 --> 26:44.917
so I must be looking for you.

26:45.750 --> 26:47.500
Why?

26:47.583 --> 26:48.750
There's nothing here for you.

26:48.958 --> 26:50.125
Sit wherever you like.

26:52.167 --> 26:53.583
Did you come here yourself?

26:53.667 --> 26:55.208
Or did someone send you here?

26:56.667 --> 26:57.375
Who are you?

26:57.833 --> 26:58.875
I'm a doctor.

26:59.458 --> 27:00.667
I'm here to treat you.

27:03.792 --> 27:05.125
You don't look sick at all.

27:08.167 --> 27:08.750
You're so hungry!

27:12.292 --> 27:14.000
I can smell the taste of food

27:14.833 --> 27:16.292
Then I think I've probably found the right person.

27:16.500 --> 27:17.625
Who are you looking for?

27:18.083 --> 27:20.083
Someone very important.

27:20.167 --> 27:21.417
That can't be me.

27:22.833 --> 27:24.667
I'll know once you've eaten this.

27:25.458 --> 27:26.375
If you're really the one,

27:26.708 --> 27:28.333
I'll get you out of here.

27:29.500 --> 27:30.125
Here...

27:30.542 --> 27:32.042
And here's some pickled chili.

27:32.583 --> 27:34.750
My name is Zhuge.

27:34.875 --> 27:36.500
What about you, what's your name?

27:37.708 --> 27:39.042
What should I call you?

27:41.708 --> 27:42.833
Whatever you like.

27:43.708 --> 27:44.833
I have no name

27:44.917 --> 27:46.000
and no family.

27:50.375 --> 27:51.292
I see that on your arm

27:51.375 --> 27:53.083
you have a little red circle.

27:53.208 --> 27:54.542
So I'll call you Circle.

27:56.625 --> 27:58.250
"Circle"?

27:58.917 --> 28:00.125
Is that a name?

28:00.208 --> 28:01.292
It is now.

28:01.917 --> 28:02.958
Circle...

28:03.750 --> 28:04.708
So cute.

28:04.792 --> 28:05.792
Take your time.

28:07.958 --> 28:10.250
I can tell you're not sick at all.

28:10.333 --> 28:12.208
I'll take you out once you've finished eating.

28:15.375 --> 28:16.208
Really?

28:16.292 --> 28:16.958
For sure.

28:41.083 --> 28:45.333
KAIFENG CITY

28:45.542 --> 28:47.042
Look at this calligraphy piece.

28:49.083 --> 28:50.375
Why are there so many earthworms?

29:21.125 --> 29:21.917
Oh no!

29:22.708 --> 29:24.333
No,no,no!

29:47.167 --> 29:49.333
Look, the Temple of Ancestors!

30:03.917 --> 30:06.917
Their target is the temple, not us!

30:07.000 --> 30:09.750
Damn them, they've hurt so many people!

30:09.833 --> 30:12.833
I think they're looking for something underground.

30:12.833 --> 30:15.333
Let's get down there before they do.

30:19.708 --> 30:21.708
There's someone buried here, come and help!

30:24.000 --> 30:24.667
Xiao Han!

30:25.375 --> 30:26.542
Over here!

30:27.958 --> 30:29.458
Quick! Look at this!

30:29.958 --> 30:31.208
Can you see someone over there?

30:31.833 --> 30:32.583
There!

30:40.667 --> 30:42.333
Brother Xiang!

30:42.417 --> 30:44.208
We need to check if anyone's there.

30:45.208 --> 30:46.208
Yeah.

30:46.292 --> 30:47.417
You go in first to check.

30:47.500 --> 30:49.917
I'll send people to back you up in a bit.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.458
Anyone in there?

30:54.833 --> 30:55.458
Brother...

30:55.667 --> 30:57.708
You think there's any good stuff down there?

30:58.917 --> 31:00.625
He's a very serious kid.

31:00.708 --> 31:02.250
Let him go alone.

31:13.417 --> 31:14.833
Anyone there?

31:18.792 --> 31:21.083
He's the constable who ate 200 buns!

31:22.500 --> 31:23.583
Let him be.

31:24.167 --> 31:26.042
Anyone there?

31:37.542 --> 31:38.958
What's this?

31:40.500 --> 31:41.500
Qibu, do you know?

31:41.583 --> 31:42.583
SHOW up!

31:49.417 --> 31:50.792
It's an attack formation!

31:55.958 --> 31:57.542
Who were these people?

32:02.208 --> 32:04.458
The chain bears the mark of the Wuyin clan.

32:07.583 --> 32:09.833
So you think those were members of our clan?

32:15.042 --> 32:16.417
The unusual movement of the iron ball

32:16.500 --> 32:17.417
must be related to the earthquake.

32:19.458 --> 32:21.125
The creature trapped inside the ball

32:21.667 --> 32:23.500
must have sensed something.

32:25.958 --> 32:27.417
After all these years

32:28.292 --> 32:30.583
it's still strong enough to survive captivity.

33:04.208 --> 33:06.583
This guy fell and landed here.

33:06.667 --> 33:08.833
Leave him, let's deal with the ball first.

33:08.917 --> 33:10.125
Should we knock him out?

33:10.208 --> 33:11.083
What?

33:11.333 --> 33:13.083
No need, we'll deal with his memories later.

33:13.375 --> 33:15.000
Who on earth are you people?

33:16.125 --> 33:16.792
It's coming!

33:25.208 --> 33:26.625
The aura is palpable!

33:26.708 --> 33:27.833
Is that it?

34:27.125 --> 34:29.375
It's come to release the creature inside the ball!

36:04.458 --> 36:06.500
We can't let it get out alive!

37:44.000 --> 37:45.167
There's water down there!

37:45.167 --> 37:45.958
Make Way!

38:11.375 --> 38:14.167
You and I have to become one body

38:25.292 --> 38:27.583
Become one body?

38:28.333 --> 38:30.958
So will your body be discarded?

38:31.042 --> 38:33.500
Or will it be mine?

38:42.833 --> 38:45.583
You know how many people I've killed?

38:46.000 --> 38:48.333
Many more than these few here.

38:48.417 --> 38:50.250
To handle this scum,

38:50.500 --> 38:52.917
I am all that's needed.

38:53.958 --> 38:55.417
They are so naive.

38:55.500 --> 38:59.750
They'll fight each other even for small benefits.

39:00.208 --> 39:02.917
I pretended to be imprisoned in the ball

39:03.125 --> 39:06.833
just so they'd start killing each other.

39:06.958 --> 39:08.958
So you're saying...

39:09.458 --> 39:11.333
I wasted my time rescuing you!

39:11.417 --> 39:13.458
My immense powers

39:13.667 --> 39:15.792
are not limited to my body.

39:15.875 --> 39:20.000
They're also in the Destroyer of Worlds!

39:20.083 --> 39:21.583
Follow me!

39:25.958 --> 39:29.167
KAIFENG POLICE DETECTIVE BUREAU

39:29.458 --> 39:30.167
Brother...

39:30.667 --> 39:33.250
We're hiding right beside the police headquarters.

39:33.333 --> 39:35.208
The creatures wouldn't expect that, right?

39:37.708 --> 39:38.500
Who knows?

39:39.125 --> 39:40.917
Those creatures could be hiding everywhere.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.375
Are you sure they're not in the police station?

39:44.208 --> 39:45.167
You're right.

39:47.083 --> 39:48.583
Sister is here! Let's go.

39:54.625 --> 39:55.583
Someone's injured!

39:56.375 --> 39:57.125
It's him!

39:58.333 --> 39:59.333
He's still bleeding.

39:59.333 --> 40:00.958
Use the wound medicine.

40:03.500 --> 40:05.083
We ran into one of the creatures.

40:05.167 --> 40:06.208
He was trying to save us.

40:06.292 --> 40:07.167
He's badly injured.

40:07.208 --> 40:07.750
Third Sister...

40:07.750 --> 40:08.833
Second Brother is back.

40:09.250 --> 40:10.083
Let him take care of this.

40:13.917 --> 40:16.042
I'm back!

40:18.958 --> 40:20.792
You're back!

40:29.083 --> 40:29.833
Wait a moment.

40:32.875 --> 40:35.292
What's up here?

40:36.125 --> 40:37.458
You're injured?

40:39.000 --> 40:40.083
Who is he?

40:42.458 --> 40:44.167
He's in the worst shape, treat him first.

40:44.833 --> 40:46.208
Have you found our new leader?

40:46.667 --> 40:47.250
Yes.

40:47.250 --> 40:48.042
Where is he?

40:50.333 --> 40:51.042
There.

41:02.750 --> 41:05.875
Have you forgotten the Three Nevers
and Four Don'ts?

41:05.958 --> 41:07.208
<i>What Three Nevers and Four Don's'?</i>

41:07.292 --> 41:08.833
The Three Nevers: Never be clingy,

41:08.917 --> 41:10.458
Never be talkative, Never lose your temper.

41:11.167 --> 41:11.875
<i>The Four Dorks...</i>

41:12.083 --> 41:13.500
The Four Don'ts are: Don't show off,

41:13.583 --> 41:14.333
Don't forget to take your medicine,

41:14.417 --> 41:15.500
Don't betray confidences,

41:15.583 --> 41:16.083
Don't...

41:16.417 --> 41:16.917
Don't...

41:17.708 --> 41:19.125
Don't squander money.

41:19.417 --> 41:20.750
Don't squander money.

41:24.625 --> 41:25.625
Is she really our...

41:25.708 --> 41:27.125
Leader?

41:28.333 --> 41:29.542
That's right

41:29.625 --> 41:31.000
She is indeed our new...

41:31.083 --> 41:32.500
Leaden

41:32.875 --> 41:33.917
Circle.

41:34.417 --> 41:35.167
Say What?

41:35.583 --> 41:37.167
Circle.

41:38.375 --> 41:39.458
What?

41:40.125 --> 41:41.167
Let me tell you...

41:41.250 --> 41:43.000
I have more grievances than I can count right now.

41:43.083 --> 41:44.125
You'd better explain everything

41:44.208 --> 41:45.208
before I lose it completely!

41:48.792 --> 41:49.583
Fine.

41:49.958 --> 41:51.667
I'll do my best to explain.

41:54.250 --> 41:55.250
I...

41:55.542 --> 41:57.375
...went into the incurables wing of the clinic.

41:57.458 --> 42:00.333
And scary things began to happen.

42:42.292 --> 42:44.083
Don't touch me!

43:05.083 --> 43:06.625
Why are we hugging each other?

43:06.708 --> 43:07.542
Circle.

43:08.000 --> 43:09.542
It's like this, actually...

43:09.625 --> 43:11.292
No one has ever hugged me before.

43:11.375 --> 43:13.417
I like it.

43:13.500 --> 43:14.958
Can we keep doing it?

43:15.042 --> 43:16.750
Circle!

43:20.500 --> 43:22.667
You were sent out to find our new leader.

43:23.125 --> 43:25.583
And what have you come back with?

43:26.292 --> 43:28.000
She's one of those creatures!

43:28.083 --> 43:29.667
Zhuge, you've made a big mistake!

43:29.875 --> 43:30.708
Okay, okay.

43:30.708 --> 43:31.708
Let's take a look.

43:32.667 --> 43:33.375
Circle!

43:34.042 --> 43:34.750
Here.

43:35.667 --> 43:37.042
That really is the mark of the leader.

43:37.125 --> 43:39.083
I'm the one you're looking for, aren't I?

43:39.083 --> 43:39.667
Right.

43:40.417 --> 43:41.542
How did you get that mark?

43:42.583 --> 43:43.208
I don't know.

43:43.292 --> 43:44.792
Why were you at Jingshi Hall?

43:44.875 --> 43:45.875
I don't know!

43:46.792 --> 43:47.667
I've asked her all of this already.

43:47.750 --> 43:49.000
She can't remember anything.

43:49.083 --> 43:49.833
Who are your family?

43:50.000 --> 43:50.833
Where are they?

43:51.792 --> 43:52.958
He's my family!

43:53.458 --> 43:54.458
Feels so good.

43:56.625 --> 43:57.417
This 'Circle' here

43:57.500 --> 43:59.292
is pretending to be stupid, hiding her identity.

43:59.583 --> 44:00.583
She clings to us as if we're connected.

44:00.667 --> 44:02.833
I think it's inappropriate.

44:02.958 --> 44:03.750
Inappropriate!

44:03.917 --> 44:04.500
Inappropriate!

44:04.625 --> 44:05.458
Very inappropriate!

44:06.667 --> 44:07.500
What about him?

44:08.167 --> 44:09.250
He's badly injured.

44:11.125 --> 44:12.083
Are we just going to ditch him here?

44:13.917 --> 44:15.167
Return him to the police station.

44:15.250 --> 44:17.542
But he's badly hurt, and he even saved us!

44:17.875 --> 44:19.667
An occupational injury!

44:19.750 --> 44:20.625
Send him back to the police station

44:20.708 --> 44:23.000
and he can convalesce on full pay!

44:23.208 --> 44:25.167
And this stupid girl from nowhere...

44:25.250 --> 44:27.083
She can go back where she came from.

44:28.708 --> 44:30.750
Circle has the mark of the leader on her.

44:30.833 --> 44:32.542
It's quite a different situation.

44:32.625 --> 44:34.250
She's not 'from nowhere.'

44:34.333 --> 44:35.542
Zhuge has his reasons.

44:35.625 --> 44:36.792
And it's chaos out there!

44:36.875 --> 44:39.417
She's just a girl, where can she go?

44:39.500 --> 44:41.208
I'm not going anywhere!

44:41.292 --> 44:43.917
All right, you can stay.

44:44.875 --> 44:46.500
But...

44:46.500 --> 44:48.042
Tie her up!

44:53.625 --> 44:54.458
You know, Third Sister

44:54.542 --> 44:56.708
seems to ignore trifling matters in normal times.

44:57.292 --> 44:59.958
But she's actually very careful about the details.

45:01.083 --> 45:01.958
In fact...

45:02.042 --> 45:04.667
I don't think Circle is pretending to be stupid.

45:04.750 --> 45:06.083
I think she just really is stupid.

45:06.167 --> 45:07.083
Maybe...

45:07.167 --> 45:09.042
...she really is our new leader.

45:09.667 --> 45:11.708
But maybe Second Brother brought her here

45:11.792 --> 45:13.667
just to make us feel better?

45:14.458 --> 45:16.250
That wouldn't be such a bad thing, either.

45:16.333 --> 45:19.042
It's like the sun shines in here

45:19.125 --> 45:21.750
while rain pours down outside.

45:23.292 --> 45:25.333
No arm and no leg? What kind of constable are you?

45:25.333 --> 45:26.042
Go back home!

45:26.042 --> 45:26.667
Get out!

45:26.667 --> 45:27.625
Go!

46:35.250 --> 46:37.292
How can we take care of him?

46:37.375 --> 46:39.458
The Wuyin Clan has its secrets.

46:39.542 --> 46:40.833
I know our house rules

46:40.917 --> 46:41.833
Bring him along.

46:41.917 --> 46:43.708
Let him go when he's recovered.

46:44.042 --> 46:44.792
No worries.

46:44.875 --> 46:46.500
I've already erased his memory.

46:47.750 --> 46:49.292
I understand.

46:49.375 --> 46:52.000
If it weren't for him,

46:52.083 --> 46:54.292
we wouldn't be standing face-to-face now.

46:57.042 --> 46:57.667
Dragonfly...

46:58.333 --> 47:00.292
I have a gift for you.

47:00.500 --> 47:02.500
Today is your birthday.

47:07.833 --> 47:09.667
Another dragonfly hairpin?

47:10.000 --> 47:10.917
My name may be Dragonfly,

47:11.000 --> 47:13.208
but you don't have to give me one every year.

47:14.667 --> 47:15.542
Aren't you a fortune teller?

47:16.417 --> 47:18.292
Can't you tell what I really want?

47:19.583 --> 47:21.458
There's nothing under heaven that
I can't foretell.

47:21.542 --> 47:22.625
But when it comes to us...

47:22.708 --> 47:24.458
I've never dared try to see what's coming.

47:26.042 --> 47:27.500
What if it's something bad?

47:28.583 --> 47:30.083
Then let's let nature take its course.

47:32.042 --> 47:34.042
As you know, our house rules state

47:34.125 --> 47:35.458
that if fellow disciples fall in love,

47:35.542 --> 47:37.292
they must be punished.

47:37.375 --> 47:39.958
So this hairpin demands a slap.

47:41.583 --> 47:42.292
Sister...

47:42.542 --> 47:43.375
Feel free.

47:48.542 --> 47:49.042
All right.

47:49.125 --> 47:49.917
Now it's my turn.

47:50.000 --> 47:50.542
Why?

47:50.625 --> 47:51.458
You showed emotion.

47:52.167 --> 47:54.250
You blushed when I gave you the gift.

47:54.333 --> 47:55.417
By our house rules,

47:55.500 --> 47:56.667
you're in line for punishment too.

47:57.500 --> 47:59.125
Okay, I admit it!

47:59.208 --> 48:00.417
Go ahead! As hard as you like.

48:09.667 --> 48:10.500
Speaking of house rules...

48:10.583 --> 48:12.250
You and that woman 'Circle'

48:13.000 --> 48:15.250
are hugging each other all the time.

48:15.333 --> 48:17.042
So she should also be punished.

48:17.125 --> 48:19.250
That's a matter for further investigation.

48:19.333 --> 48:20.583
Fine!

48:20.667 --> 48:21.875
Then let's find Big Brother right away.

48:21.958 --> 48:24.250
He'll confirm if she's our new leader or not.

48:38.458 --> 48:41.042
THREE LIVES PAVILION

48:41.875 --> 48:46.083
Burn my heart

48:46.083 --> 48:49.958
Let the fire burn my heart

48:50.542 --> 48:54.208
This burning fire

48:54.792 --> 48:58.667
is singing for our true love

49:01.708 --> 49:02.917
Brother Zhuge!

49:04.292 --> 49:05.250
New clothes?

49:05.875 --> 49:07.792
Another threesome?

49:07.958 --> 49:09.417
What tickles your fancy this time?

49:09.500 --> 49:10.750
You're so intimate with him.

49:12.417 --> 49:13.542
You clearly know her well!

49:13.958 --> 49:15.792
Are you kidding?

49:15.875 --> 49:17.250
You think I'm so easy?

49:17.333 --> 49:19.375
You have any idea what she really looks like?

49:20.833 --> 49:21.917
You think I could get off with her?

49:29.542 --> 49:32.417
Why do all the women here have bruised eyes?

49:32.500 --> 49:34.083
Blood on their lips too!

49:34.167 --> 49:35.625
Were they hurt?

49:37.167 --> 49:38.708
What are you talking about?

49:38.708 --> 49:40.458
Wearing makeup is not getting hurt!

49:40.542 --> 49:42.833
Why do they paint their faces like that?

49:43.208 --> 49:44.708
To make men like them!

49:46.250 --> 49:47.458
Big Brother says

49:47.542 --> 49:49.333
he'll use her to speak to us.

49:56.792 --> 49:57.958
That's Big Brother's voice!

49:59.042 --> 50:01.000
Mankind doesn't know this,

50:01.542 --> 50:03.875
but alien creatures are among us.

50:04.917 --> 50:07.542
They don't usually trouble us,

50:08.208 --> 50:10.042
but lately something has changed.

50:10.958 --> 50:12.792
Something ordered that fish

50:12.917 --> 50:14.542
to pass that painting

50:14.667 --> 50:15.792
to Nose Hair.

50:16.292 --> 50:17.500
The final intended recipient

50:18.000 --> 50:19.042
remains unknown.

50:19.333 --> 50:22.083
The Destroyer of Worlds was found in Luoyang.

50:22.417 --> 50:24.375
Five clan leaders will be needed

50:24.375 --> 50:26.125
in order to activate it.

50:26.667 --> 50:28.000
This is no coincidence.

50:29.167 --> 50:32.792
The painting and the device are connected.

50:33.333 --> 50:35.083
The situation is critical.

50:36.417 --> 50:39.458
We'll need our new leader to deal with it.

50:39.917 --> 50:42.500
We must meet soon to make a plan.

50:42.708 --> 50:44.667
This concludes my message.

50:46.875 --> 50:47.917
Big Brother's message has ended.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.917
It will be erased automatically in three seconds.

50:51.750 --> 50:52.458
Three!

50:53.708 --> 50:54.500
Erased!

50:55.250 --> 50:56.500
Why do you always

50:56.583 --> 50:57.708
channel stuff through her?

50:58.083 --> 50:59.250
Even Big Brother does it!

50:59.333 --> 51:00.792
Leaving us such an important message through her.

51:01.125 --> 51:02.917
Because messages have to be
transmitted accurately.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.250
She even gets his facial expressions! She's the best.

51:12.875 --> 51:14.625
ZHENYUAN SECURITY

51:18.667 --> 51:21.500
We're off to Luoyang to find Big Brother.

51:21.583 --> 51:23.000
But this constable has to come too.

51:23.083 --> 51:25.375
And the creature as well!

51:25.458 --> 51:27.500
Isn't that crazy?

51:32.375 --> 51:34.875
What goes in this big box?

51:34.958 --> 51:36.000
For safety's sake,

51:36.208 --> 51:38.500
you'll have to hide inside it
while we're on the road.

51:40.042 --> 51:40.917
What about the others?

51:41.708 --> 51:43.167
Why don't they need to hide?

51:44.042 --> 51:46.250
Why only me?

51:46.583 --> 51:47.958
They have to hit the road.

51:48.542 --> 51:51.083
They don't have your special privileges.

51:53.958 --> 51:55.667
This letter outlines your confidential assignment.

51:55.750 --> 51:57.625
It's from your superior at the police station.

51:58.833 --> 52:01.000
When you get to Luoyang,

52:01.083 --> 52:02.500
you must hand it to someone called 'No Name.'

52:04.292 --> 52:07.167
There's no address provided,
you'll figure it out yourself.

52:08.750 --> 52:11.333
When did this happen to me?

52:12.917 --> 52:15.000
How did you people come to know me?

52:15.542 --> 52:16.708
Why didn't my superior

52:16.792 --> 52:18.458
brief me about this in person?

52:18.542 --> 52:19.958
The police station is full of spies,

52:19.958 --> 52:22.333
hence the special arrangement.

52:22.417 --> 52:23.750
There's a police seal on the letter.

52:23.750 --> 52:24.958
See for yourself.

52:25.917 --> 52:27.375
You were injured in the line of duty.

52:27.458 --> 52:28.875
Very meritorious!

52:29.625 --> 52:31.042
This iron crutch

52:31.042 --> 52:32.792
has been supplied to you

52:34.875 --> 52:36.542
along with a couple of other things too.

52:39.458 --> 52:40.333
A good fit!

52:55.208 --> 52:56.708
Don't show off, use the crutch!

52:59.083 --> 53:00.167
Where's my blade?

53:45.542 --> 53:46.958
What are you up to?

53:50.333 --> 53:51.125
Golly!

53:52.167 --> 53:53.542
Where did you get that makeup?

53:53.750 --> 53:55.125
Look at your face!

53:56.917 --> 53:58.083
I found it in the wagon.

53:58.208 --> 54:00.917
Lots of women paint their faces like this,
I've seen it.

54:01.000 --> 54:02.583
They say it makes people like them.

54:02.667 --> 54:04.417
What do you think of my injuries?

54:07.417 --> 54:09.542
It's fine.

54:09.625 --> 54:10.625
Not bad.

54:15.875 --> 54:17.292
It's beautiful!

54:20.875 --> 54:23.708
Would you admire me more if there were more blood?

54:23.708 --> 54:25.417
No need, go back inside.

54:25.500 --> 54:26.625
Everyone already admires you so much.

54:32.417 --> 54:34.958
I'm in full agreement with you.

54:35.583 --> 54:37.125
You know what I'm thinking?

54:38.167 --> 54:39.917
I'm hoping she isn't the real leader.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.583
If she is, we're done for.

54:45.083 --> 54:49.583
DRAGON GATE CAVE

54:54.958 --> 54:58.167
CHAPTER 4: FIVE CLAN LEADERS, ONE DEVICE

54:58.333 --> 55:00.250
The leaders of the five clans have all come!

55:00.542 --> 55:01.792
You're so punctual.

55:02.500 --> 55:05.167
The greatest marvel of all time,

55:05.250 --> 55:06.417
the legendary Destroyer of Worlds,

55:06.500 --> 55:07.750
is right beside me.

55:08.167 --> 55:10.000
Please show yourselves.

55:11.875 --> 55:13.458
The Tang Clan.

55:14.542 --> 55:16.167
The Diancang Clan.

55:17.208 --> 55:19.083
The Seven-color Hell.

55:20.250 --> 55:21.792
The Kunlun Clan.

55:22.708 --> 55:25.458
The Beggar Gang.

55:25.542 --> 55:26.750
Stop blabbering!

55:26.833 --> 55:28.042
It's just the five of us.

55:28.292 --> 55:29.000
Show us that damn toy!

55:29.375 --> 55:31.542
Let's see if it's fun to play with!

55:31.875 --> 55:33.583
It is rumoured to be a device
with limitless power.

55:33.833 --> 55:35.458
Strong enough to overturn the seas

55:35.542 --> 55:37.292
and crush the mountains

55:37.792 --> 55:41.083
We'll see if this is true or not.

55:41.708 --> 55:44.708
But why such a powerful device was sent to me

55:45.000 --> 55:48.333
and who sent it-it's all still a mystery.

55:50.875 --> 55:53.542
So everyone here better be careful with it!

56:04.250 --> 56:05.458
It's empty!

56:05.542 --> 56:06.917
So it's merely a rumor!

56:09.625 --> 56:11.375
It has been in your care.

56:11.458 --> 56:13.083
Weren't you aware that someone switched it?

56:13.583 --> 56:15.333
This is an omnipotent device.

56:15.417 --> 56:16.958
It must contain some hidden mystery.

56:17.625 --> 56:18.458
Great Fortune-teller,

56:18.958 --> 56:19.750
allow me to see.

56:20.000 --> 56:22.292
Let me try with our Tang Clan's Star Codes!

56:22.458 --> 56:23.750
Let him do it.

56:48.792 --> 56:50.208
So this is the Destroyer of Worlds?

56:50.292 --> 56:51.917
Vapourizing to an orb
when the destroyer device is sought.

56:51.917 --> 56:53.417
It's one of our Diancang codes.

56:53.500 --> 56:56.125
So the orb is just one part of the device.

56:57.333 --> 56:58.625
Allow me.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.708
"Dark clouds presage rain,

57:04.792 --> 57:06.500
and the door to hell opens"!

57:08.292 --> 57:09.167
Lord of Hell,

57:09.542 --> 57:11.042
May I also take a look?

57:12.792 --> 57:13.875
"Eight arms molding the heavens,"

57:16.667 --> 57:17.750
"the dragon swells the sea."

57:30.958 --> 57:34.333
Kunlun Clan's Fiery Palm!

57:42.208 --> 57:43.250
Strange.

57:44.917 --> 57:46.625
So the five clan leaders' powers
need to be combined

57:46.708 --> 57:48.458
in order to activate the device?

57:52.292 --> 57:53.458
Correct!

57:53.542 --> 57:56.083
So each of us has some connection with it,

57:56.167 --> 57:57.625
except for the leader of the Diancang Clan.

57:58.208 --> 57:59.583
He hasn't done anything!

58:00.417 --> 58:01.958
We from the Diancang Clan
have the codes for this device.

58:02.042 --> 58:03.542
So only we could make use of it.

58:03.625 --> 58:04.583
Give it to me!

58:04.667 --> 58:05.292
Wait!

58:06.417 --> 58:08.333
For a long time now, I have sensed

58:08.417 --> 58:11.583
that your aura is the same as that of the fish.

58:12.292 --> 58:15.333
So you and the fish are traps!

58:16.083 --> 58:17.375
Who sent you here?

58:17.500 --> 58:18.750
And for what purpose?

58:19.250 --> 58:20.750
You are not the Great Fortune-teller!

58:21.292 --> 58:23.125
You're from the Wuyin Clan!

58:23.208 --> 58:24.208
You're right!

58:24.292 --> 58:26.000
He's too dignified for the likes of you.

58:26.083 --> 58:27.750
So I'm meeting you in his stead.

58:32.333 --> 58:34.250
The Wuyin Clan style!

58:34.667 --> 58:35.333
Zhifu!

58:35.417 --> 58:36.042
Tengshe!

58:36.125 --> 58:36.625
Taiyin!

58:36.875 --> 58:37.917
Liuhe! Gouchen!

58:38.000 --> 58:39.167
The sky above, the earth below!

58:43.625 --> 58:45.792
You are not the leader of the Diancang Clan.

58:46.000 --> 58:47.292
You are an alien creature!

58:47.375 --> 58:48.542
Where is the clan leader?

58:48.625 --> 58:52.292
I've already eliminated him!

59:19.042 --> 59:20.250
Can't you see?

59:20.792 --> 59:22.458
As for how they join us...

59:23.042 --> 59:26.000
These are the men I enslaved.

59:26.083 --> 59:28.708
To help them attain the highest level
of martial skills,

59:28.792 --> 59:31.042
I have fed them strange flowers

59:31.125 --> 59:33.000
and essence of toad!

59:35.667 --> 59:38.292
Their skills are now great.

59:38.292 --> 59:40.125
But from here on out, they must obey my command

59:40.208 --> 59:42.708
with every move they make!

59:42.792 --> 59:43.875
Eight-armed Ape!

59:45.000 --> 59:46.000
Who are you?

59:48.625 --> 59:50.500
So this was your plan all along.

59:50.667 --> 59:52.708
To make the clan leaders your slaves!

59:52.833 --> 59:54.542
Eight-armed Ape!

59:54.625 --> 59:56.792
Use your Eight-armed palm power

59:56.875 --> 59:58.208
to slay Great Fortune-teller!

01:00:39.375 --> 01:00:41.000
Lord of Hell!

01:00:41.417 --> 01:00:43.167
Soul-sapping Palm!

01:00:52.083 --> 01:00:53.083
Unguided Flying Rings!

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:05.917
Fiery Palm!

01:01:23.792 --> 01:01:25.625
That Destroyer of Worlds...

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:28.667
I made it to serve my plans.

01:01:28.750 --> 01:01:31.125
Give me back the orb!

01:01:36.083 --> 01:01:38.500
A new power has joined the Wuyin Clan.

01:01:38.583 --> 01:01:40.917
It might help them open the Dunjia device.

01:01:41.125 --> 01:01:43.125
You fear that my power is not mighty enough.

01:01:43.208 --> 01:01:45.250
So you want to use this device

01:01:45.417 --> 01:01:47.042
to fight the Wuyin Clan.

01:01:47.542 --> 01:01:49.083
So what?

01:01:49.167 --> 01:01:51.500
I won't give it to you!

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.417
I can send these clan leaders

01:01:54.625 --> 01:01:57.125
to locate this new source of power

01:01:57.208 --> 01:01:59.583
and finish off the Wuyin Clan!

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.792
White Tiger!

01:02:03.708 --> 01:02:05.000
Red Eye!

01:02:26.708 --> 01:02:28.042
The sandstorm is getting worse!

01:02:28.417 --> 01:02:30.167
It's impossible to know our direction!

01:02:30.542 --> 01:02:31.167
What shall we do?

01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:32.583
Keep going!

01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:34.542
Legend has it,

01:02:34.625 --> 01:02:37.417
there's a ship in this desert that
can shelter us from the storm!

01:02:37.833 --> 01:02:39.333
What place is that?

01:02:40.292 --> 01:02:41.958
The Nether Mansion!

01:02:42.042 --> 01:02:43.417
Where is it?

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.042
Follow me!

01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:52.458
THE NETHER MANSION

01:02:52.542 --> 01:02:54.750
This is the Nether Mansion of legend.

01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:56.833
What's in there?

01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:00.417
I dunno,

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:02.000
but it's been derelict for years.

01:03:02.458 --> 01:03:04.500
We can't go on under this weather.

01:03:04.583 --> 01:03:05.833
Let's take shelter here!

01:03:05.917 --> 01:03:06.708
Let's go!

01:03:12.625 --> 01:03:14.000
Stay wary.

01:03:14.083 --> 01:03:15.625
The creatures could attack any time.

01:03:26.708 --> 01:03:27.542
This place...

01:03:28.083 --> 01:03:30.958
It must've been home to a great clan once.

01:03:44.125 --> 01:03:45.375
Circle...

01:03:46.458 --> 01:03:48.208
Just now Big Ox dropped you hard.

01:03:48.583 --> 01:03:49.167
Are you hurt?

01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:50.083
No,no,no.

01:03:50.583 --> 01:03:52.292
We haven't hugged for ages!

01:03:53.292 --> 01:03:55.208
Let's hug later, I brought some food for you.

01:03:55.292 --> 01:03:56.500
I can smell it!

01:03:58.875 --> 01:04:00.167
Tell me...

01:04:00.250 --> 01:04:02.167
Why do they keep talking

01:04:02.250 --> 01:04:03.417
about finding a "leader"

01:04:03.417 --> 01:04:05.542
and about the "Big Brother of the Wuyin Clan"?

01:04:05.625 --> 01:04:07.250
Who are they talking about?

01:04:10.042 --> 01:04:11.750
How do you know all that?

01:04:13.083 --> 01:04:13.792
I'm telling you...

01:04:13.875 --> 01:04:16.125
I can hear everything they say
about me behind my back.

01:04:18.542 --> 01:04:19.583
Absurd!

01:04:19.667 --> 01:04:21.958
Dragging someone so useless along for the ride.

01:04:22.042 --> 01:04:23.292
I'm leaving her behind tomorrow!

01:04:23.375 --> 01:04:25.333
Then we can race into Luoyang on horseback!

01:04:25.417 --> 01:04:26.625
Talking about me?

01:04:29.375 --> 01:04:30.708
You're thinking too much.

01:04:40.667 --> 01:04:42.583
Can you help me out

01:04:42.667 --> 01:04:45.250
by listening to what Dragonfly and Dao are saying?

01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:48.167
I'm going to Luoyang on a secret mission.

01:04:48.250 --> 01:04:49.833
What about you?

01:04:49.917 --> 01:04:51.125
Are you going

01:04:51.208 --> 01:04:53.250
just to protect that girl called 'Circle'?

01:04:53.542 --> 01:04:55.042
Are you taking her somewhere special?

01:04:55.708 --> 01:04:57.125
If only it were that easy!

01:04:57.208 --> 01:04:59.125
We're destined to be stuck with her.

01:05:04.417 --> 01:05:05.792
Thank you.

01:05:06.333 --> 01:05:08.542
You've never spoken ill of me.

01:05:08.625 --> 01:05:10.750
And you always stand up for me.

01:05:10.833 --> 01:05:12.083
If you weren't here,

01:05:12.167 --> 01:05:13.000
they'd probably treat me worse

01:05:13.083 --> 01:05:15.375
than those people at Jingshi Hall did.

01:05:15.875 --> 01:05:16.708
No way.

01:05:18.750 --> 01:05:21.542
You are the kindest man in the world!

01:05:21.625 --> 01:05:22.542
Without you,

01:05:22.625 --> 01:05:24.417
I wouldn't know how to handle all this.

01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:25.250
All right.

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:27.167
So how many slaps does that warrant?

01:05:29.208 --> 01:05:30.292
Circle, I have to explain.

01:05:30.583 --> 01:05:33.958
We don't know how they began,

01:05:34.042 --> 01:05:35.458
but the Wuyin Clan follows certain house rules.

01:05:35.917 --> 01:05:37.542
We cannot-

01:05:37.625 --> 01:05:38.250
I know!

01:05:39.292 --> 01:05:41.333
Anyone who develops feelings
for someone gets slapped.

01:05:41.333 --> 01:05:42.750
I've heard it all.

01:05:42.833 --> 01:05:43.958
Brother Zhuge!

01:05:44.042 --> 01:05:45.833
I'd even give up my life for you.

01:05:45.833 --> 01:05:47.833
A slap here or there is nothing.

01:05:49.167 --> 01:05:51.208
Slap me as hard as you can.

01:05:51.292 --> 01:05:52.833
That will tell me how fond you are of me.

01:05:52.917 --> 01:05:53.542
Circle...

01:05:53.625 --> 01:05:55.750
Come on, ten slaps at least.

01:05:55.917 --> 01:05:56.500
Good!

01:05:56.583 --> 01:05:57.167
Ten!

01:05:57.625 --> 01:05:58.167
Right now!

01:05:59.833 --> 01:06:00.458
Come on!

01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:02.042
Come on!

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.250
If you don't do it,

01:06:04.250 --> 01:06:06.292
it'll mean you have feelings for her too.

01:06:08.792 --> 01:06:10.042
Then you'd have to slap him ten times too!

01:06:12.250 --> 01:06:13.167
Brother Zhuge...

01:06:13.458 --> 01:06:14.708
I don't mind going first.

01:06:14.792 --> 01:06:15.917
How many slaps do you want?

01:06:16.333 --> 01:06:18.083
The more the better, right?

01:06:18.083 --> 01:06:18.958
Fine.

01:06:19.333 --> 01:06:22.042
You've caught on fast to our house rules.

01:06:23.333 --> 01:06:24.333
Twenty, then.

01:06:25.458 --> 01:06:26.708
Okay, Sixty-nine slaps!

01:06:27.375 --> 01:06:28.375
Two!

01:06:29.250 --> 01:06:30.125
Three!

01:06:30.625 --> 01:06:31.125
Four!

01:06:31.208 --> 01:06:32.167
Come on, harder!

01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:33.458
Five!

01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:34.083
Harder!

01:06:34.167 --> 01:06:34.792
Six!

01:06:35.458 --> 01:06:36.000
Seven!

01:06:36.083 --> 01:06:36.625
Go on!

01:06:36.708 --> 01:06:37.375
Eight!

01:06:37.542 --> 01:06:38.333
Nine!

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:42.458
I ask the world, "What is love?"

01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:46.167
I wish someone would slap me

01:06:46.250 --> 01:06:48.292
with such enthusiasm.

01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:50.125
You know,

01:06:50.208 --> 01:06:51.500
we brothers are more than willing

01:06:51.583 --> 01:06:53.250
to make your wish come true.

01:06:53.542 --> 01:06:54.250
For sure!

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.667
Masters, with your remarkable inner skills,

01:06:57.750 --> 01:07:00.250
one blow from you would finish me off.

01:07:01.792 --> 01:07:02.667
How about this?

01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:04.625
If my martial skills improve in time,

01:07:05.792 --> 01:07:07.125
I'll ask you to challenge me.

01:07:07.667 --> 01:07:08.750
Challenge me...

01:07:58.125 --> 01:07:59.125
Let me take a look.

01:08:24.042 --> 01:08:25.500
Wait for me here.

01:08:25.582 --> 01:08:26.625
Whatever you do, don't move.

01:08:36.957 --> 01:08:38.875
So there are alien creatures
hiding here after all!

01:09:04.167 --> 01:09:06.417
We barely made it out alive
at the Temple last time!

01:09:07.375 --> 01:09:11.582
Strong aura of the aliens. Stay wary.

01:09:36.957 --> 01:09:39.292
This thing came from the chest that Circle hid in!

01:09:49.582 --> 01:09:51.500
Is this our leader?

01:09:51.582 --> 01:09:52.875
Will it eat us?

01:09:52.957 --> 01:09:54.082
Hard to say.

01:10:07.542 --> 01:10:08.208
Your hand!

01:10:32.292 --> 01:10:33.042
Circle...

01:10:33.542 --> 01:10:34.458
It's me!

01:10:50.667 --> 01:10:51.292
Dragonfly!

01:10:52.333 --> 01:10:53.542
Circle...

01:10:54.542 --> 01:10:55.792
It's me!

01:11:04.042 --> 01:11:05.208
Circle...

01:11:25.167 --> 01:11:26.333
Are you all right?

01:11:34.250 --> 01:11:35.083
Dragonfly!

01:11:37.917 --> 01:11:39.208
It's all right now, Circle.

01:11:45.167 --> 01:11:46.708
What happened?

01:12:00.333 --> 01:12:01.500
Let's get going-

01:12:11.875 --> 01:12:16.417
LUOYANG CITY

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.875
Just look at me.

01:12:28.958 --> 01:12:30.750
How can I go on being a constable?

01:12:33.083 --> 01:12:34.625
Even if I went home,

01:12:34.708 --> 01:12:36.250
that wouldn't work either.

01:12:37.042 --> 01:12:37.875
Isn't going home

01:12:38.625 --> 01:12:39.375
a good thing?

01:12:39.708 --> 01:12:41.708
I'd make my folks lose face.

01:12:44.542 --> 01:12:47.292
I don't know how that feels.

01:12:47.375 --> 01:12:48.792
I don't have family.

01:12:50.250 --> 01:12:52.042
If I left these people,

01:12:53.042 --> 01:12:55.333
I'd have to go back to Jingshi Hall.

01:13:01.208 --> 01:13:03.250
You plan to leave?

01:13:05.042 --> 01:13:08.000
I don't want to bring Zhuge more trouble.

01:13:16.167 --> 01:13:22.083
FIRST CHOICE RESIDENCE

01:13:30.917 --> 01:13:32.417
There are too many people out there,
all gossiping.

01:13:36.167 --> 01:13:38.083
Better stay here. Don't go outside.

01:13:39.375 --> 01:13:41.042
I'll bring you a meal.

01:13:44.625 --> 01:13:46.542
We've made it to Luoyang,
so I'm leaving you guys.

01:13:47.625 --> 01:13:48.958
I have my duties.

01:13:49.042 --> 01:13:50.917
I'm off to look for that 'No Name.'

01:13:52.167 --> 01:13:52.792
I see.

01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:54.458
Take care.

01:13:56.042 --> 01:13:58.042
I want to say goodbye to Circle too!

01:13:59.792 --> 01:14:00.417
Sure.

01:14:03.458 --> 01:14:04.708
Constable Dao...

01:14:06.792 --> 01:14:09.167
Luoyang is a big city,
so finding someone isn't easy.

01:14:09.875 --> 01:14:11.417
We'll stay here for two days.

01:14:13.458 --> 01:14:14.792
Come back if you need us.

01:14:22.042 --> 01:14:23.292
Go on in.

01:14:30.375 --> 01:14:31.167
Okay.

01:14:49.542 --> 01:14:51.792
In Jingshi Hall,

01:14:51.875 --> 01:14:53.792
whenever I felt bored

01:14:53.875 --> 01:14:56.000
during the winters,

01:14:56.083 --> 01:14:58.250
I'd make flowers bloom.

01:15:00.333 --> 01:15:03.375
When I did that at the Nether Mansion,

01:15:04.083 --> 01:15:05.917
I heard you cry out.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
It was as if you were in great pain.

01:15:08.083 --> 01:15:08.875
Why was that?

01:15:08.958 --> 01:15:10.083
It's really weird.

01:15:10.542 --> 01:15:12.208
It's like my bones

01:15:12.292 --> 01:15:14.500
were bursting out from my wounds.

01:15:16.542 --> 01:15:18.208
Let me see your wounds.

01:15:20.125 --> 01:15:20.750
Boss.

01:15:20.833 --> 01:15:21.583
What can I get you?

01:15:21.667 --> 01:15:22.667
Two bowls of roast goose and rice, to go.

01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:24.667
You got it. Xiao Er, two roast goose rice.

01:15:25.042 --> 01:15:26.042
Whaddaya think?

01:15:26.042 --> 01:15:28.792
Those five clan leaders are all important guys.

01:15:28.875 --> 01:15:30.083
But they fought tooth and nail

01:15:30.167 --> 01:15:31.750
over that Destroyer of Worlds device.

01:15:31.833 --> 01:15:34.458
Then it turns out it's just some stupid box
they were fighting over.

01:15:34.458 --> 01:15:36.208
And no one knows where they've gone!

01:15:36.292 --> 01:15:40.000
Haven't you heard?
The Destroyer of Worlds isn't real.

01:15:40.292 --> 01:15:43.333
Some book writer made up the whole thing

01:15:43.417 --> 01:15:44.625
just to sell more of his books!

01:15:45.083 --> 01:15:46.958
Don't believe a word of it.

01:16:36.792 --> 01:16:37.500
Circle!

01:16:38.083 --> 01:16:38.875
Are you okay?

01:16:39.833 --> 01:16:40.375
Circle!

01:16:52.208 --> 01:16:52.792
Circle!

01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:55.792
Doing this for me will hurt yourself!

01:16:56.042 --> 01:16:56.750
Stop!

01:16:59.208 --> 01:16:59.917
Stop!

01:17:03.875 --> 01:17:04.542
Circle!

01:17:07.083 --> 01:17:07.958
Circle!

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:09.667
Circle!

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.333
I hope, from now on,

01:17:12.417 --> 01:17:14.167
none of you will find me frightening.

01:17:15.417 --> 01:17:17.875
I am not your leader.

01:17:17.958 --> 01:17:19.875
Don't waste time on me.

01:17:38.292 --> 01:17:40.583
Your head is bleeding. You'll survive this.

01:17:40.667 --> 01:17:43.792
This won't last long.

01:17:45.833 --> 01:17:46.500
Circle!

01:17:46.583 --> 01:17:47.917
How can you say something like that!

01:17:48.375 --> 01:17:50.375
You can't die, don't scare me!

01:17:50.458 --> 01:17:52.958
I'm resting, not dying!

01:17:55.250 --> 01:17:56.333
A rest...

01:17:57.375 --> 01:17:59.208
Yes, take a rest...

01:18:01.375 --> 01:18:02.083
That'll be twenty coins.

01:18:06.167 --> 01:18:07.542
Just take the dishes and go!

01:18:07.625 --> 01:18:09.083
I don't want you in my sight here!

01:18:09.167 --> 01:18:10.375
It's been quite a while since I slapped you.

01:18:10.833 --> 01:18:11.833
And my hand is getting itchy.

01:18:11.917 --> 01:18:13.042
That constable of yours

01:18:13.167 --> 01:18:14.917
went to say goodbye to Circle,

01:18:14.917 --> 01:18:16.625
and he hasn't been seen since then.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.083
I'm worried for our leader's safety.

01:18:19.167 --> 01:18:21.042
What are you implying?

01:18:21.125 --> 01:18:22.875
"Constable of mine"?

01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:24.417
Didn't you tell me

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:26.667
if not for him you wouldn't
have been able to see me again?

01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:28.667
Why are you being so nasty now?

01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:30.792
Nasty?

01:18:31.333 --> 01:18:33.125
Like the things you said behind Circle's back?

01:18:33.208 --> 01:18:34.333
She found them nasty too.

01:18:34.792 --> 01:18:36.292
She eavesdropped on me?

01:18:36.625 --> 01:18:37.875
She doesn't need to.

01:18:37.958 --> 01:18:39.500
If she wants to hear, she can always listen.

01:18:39.583 --> 01:18:40.167
Really?

01:18:40.458 --> 01:18:42.125
Back there, she almost killed us all,

01:18:42.208 --> 01:18:43.750
and still you're defending her?

01:18:44.250 --> 01:18:45.125
Defending her?

01:18:45.875 --> 01:18:47.500
I almost died twice!

01:18:47.792 --> 01:18:49.208
What do you think it was all for?

01:18:50.667 --> 01:18:51.792
I know, but so what?

01:18:52.292 --> 01:18:53.833
All I see now is that

01:18:53.958 --> 01:18:54.792
You're disgusting!

01:19:00.750 --> 01:19:02.083
Remember how in the old days

01:19:02.167 --> 01:19:04.250
we were so happy slapping each other?

01:19:04.708 --> 01:19:05.750
Now it's become

01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:07.375
such a sad thing.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.167
Don't you think so?

01:19:16.750 --> 01:19:17.875
Fine!

01:19:19.542 --> 01:19:21.375
I will never slap you again.

01:19:21.792 --> 01:19:23.042
Whatever.

01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:25.167
Anyhow, even if you did,

01:19:25.250 --> 01:19:26.875
it wouldn't feel the same as it used to.

01:19:28.042 --> 01:19:28.750
Fine.

01:19:29.167 --> 01:19:31.000
The new leader can change the house rules.

01:19:36.917 --> 01:19:37.583
Big Brother!

01:19:41.542 --> 01:19:42.500
That waiter just now!

01:19:48.458 --> 01:19:49.708
Circle, what is it?

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:50.875
They're coming!

01:19:55.625 --> 01:19:56.333
Take care, everyone!

01:20:10.667 --> 01:20:12.500
They're coming!

01:21:06.625 --> 01:21:07.042
Zhuge!

01:21:07.042 --> 01:21:07.500
Circle!

01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:08.583
Zhuge, Circle says

01:21:09.292 --> 01:21:10.458
the more powerful ones are yet to come!

01:21:10.750 --> 01:21:11.667
Get her out of here now!

01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:13.208
All right, Circle...

01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:40.417
Dragonfly!

01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:42.458
Dragonfly, are you okay?

01:21:42.542 --> 01:21:43.083
Dragonfly!

01:21:43.167 --> 01:21:44.958
That bastard poisoned me!

01:21:45.875 --> 01:21:47.292
They're here for Circle!

01:21:47.375 --> 01:21:48.375
Get her out of here!

01:21:48.458 --> 01:21:49.583
Move!

01:21:50.125 --> 01:21:51.208
Your arm...

01:21:51.208 --> 01:21:52.042
What did you say?

01:21:52.125 --> 01:21:53.042
How did you...

01:21:57.583 --> 01:21:58.583
You go!

01:21:58.875 --> 01:21:59.792
No, no!

01:22:00.583 --> 01:22:01.208
Dragonfly!

01:22:03.458 --> 01:22:04.708
You're injured! Let me!

01:22:04.708 --> 01:22:06.625
You can't beat him, protect the others!

01:22:06.833 --> 01:22:07.458
Move!

01:22:08.208 --> 01:22:09.292
Don't argue!

01:22:10.583 --> 01:22:11.333
Move!

01:22:31.458 --> 01:22:32.167
Got you!

01:22:48.083 --> 01:22:48.958
Let's go together.

01:22:49.708 --> 01:22:50.333
Move.

01:22:53.875 --> 01:22:54.500
Move!

01:22:55.333 --> 01:22:56.042
Quick!

01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:07.458
Where's Dao?

01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:10.292
It seems he stayed behind.

01:23:15.167 --> 01:23:15.917
Move!

01:23:18.875 --> 01:23:19.875
You want more?

01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:24.750
What's wrong with my leg?

01:23:25.083 --> 01:23:25.875
Come on!

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.875
No, no, I can't fight like this!

01:24:00.875 --> 01:24:03.083
If you want to see Big Brother, follow me!

01:24:08.208 --> 01:24:09.542
Forget it.

01:24:09.625 --> 01:24:10.375
Get on the wagon!

01:24:11.583 --> 01:24:12.500
Move!

01:24:19.167 --> 01:24:20.625
Stop! It's enough!

01:24:23.417 --> 01:24:24.417
Again?

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:29.708
Serves you right!

01:24:44.833 --> 01:24:45.542
It's gone!

01:24:47.792 --> 01:24:48.625
Who are you?

01:24:49.333 --> 01:24:49.958
You never learn!

01:24:50.042 --> 01:24:52.167
Try my Fiery Palm!

01:25:18.375 --> 01:25:24.833
CHAPTER 5: EXTINGUISHING WUYIN

01:25:36.042 --> 01:25:36.625
Dragonfly...

01:25:37.083 --> 01:25:38.500
Do you need to rest up?

01:25:39.417 --> 01:25:41.250
I'll live, don't hassle me.

01:25:48.667 --> 01:25:49.750
Big Brother!

01:25:51.875 --> 01:25:53.250
Since you're here to save us,

01:25:53.333 --> 01:25:54.292
why were you in disguise?

01:25:54.375 --> 01:25:55.042
I had no choice.

01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:57.417
I've been watching you.

01:25:57.500 --> 01:25:59.833
Circle is not the new leader of the Wuyin Clan.

01:26:00.708 --> 01:26:02.458
Not only is she an alien creature herself,

01:26:02.542 --> 01:26:04.583
But she's actually their most powerful tool.

01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:07.333
Her specific task is to bring down Wuyin.

01:26:08.375 --> 01:26:09.333
So now we should...

01:26:31.458 --> 01:26:35.125
WE CAN'T LET HER LIVE

01:26:44.625 --> 01:26:46.875
It's my fault, I should do it.

01:26:46.958 --> 01:26:49.167
Because it's your fault, I won't let you do it!

01:26:49.250 --> 01:26:51.042
You don't trust me?

01:26:52.625 --> 01:26:54.542
It's not about trust.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.292
I know you too well.

01:26:58.375 --> 01:26:59.667
I'll do it.

01:27:20.667 --> 01:27:22.833
You heard what we just said, right?

01:27:26.583 --> 01:27:29.667
I didn't want you
to be our new leader to start with.

01:27:31.625 --> 01:27:33.875
But now I hope that's what you are.

01:27:37.250 --> 01:27:38.375
Sister...

01:27:39.458 --> 01:27:43.958
I know that bringing me along
was very dangerous.

01:27:45.875 --> 01:27:47.750
You and Brother Zhuge...

01:27:47.833 --> 01:27:50.208
From here on out, you must protect the others.

01:27:50.833 --> 01:27:52.583
Protect them well.

01:28:05.833 --> 01:28:07.417
Circle...

01:28:13.667 --> 01:28:14.792
You don't believe me?

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:21.333
This guy doesn't know our codes.

01:28:25.625 --> 01:28:26.333
Who are you?

01:28:32.125 --> 01:28:32.750
Zhuge!

01:28:34.750 --> 01:28:36.292
Circle, I'll go help him!

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:38.958
The two of you...

01:28:39.042 --> 01:28:40.000
Get away quickly!

01:29:38.458 --> 01:29:39.917
Another Big Brother!

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.875
He has Circle!

01:29:43.958 --> 01:29:47.958
Protect the leader and get her out of here.

01:29:50.208 --> 01:29:51.292
He can't have come alone.

01:29:53.042 --> 01:29:53.708
Get her away quickly!

01:30:05.583 --> 01:30:06.542
Lord of Hell!

01:30:06.625 --> 01:30:08.500
You've mastered the Wuyin art of disguise.

01:30:09.125 --> 01:30:10.292
That's nothing.

01:30:10.542 --> 01:30:11.417
What I want is

01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:13.083
that little thing's blood.

01:30:13.167 --> 01:30:14.958
It will give me much greater powers.

01:30:49.792 --> 01:30:51.208
Eight-armed Ape!

01:30:51.292 --> 01:30:52.667
How dare you challenge me?

01:30:53.625 --> 01:30:55.083
Just like you,

01:30:55.167 --> 01:30:57.250
I want that girl's blood.

01:30:57.333 --> 01:30:59.125
You want to rule supreme?

01:30:59.708 --> 01:31:01.333
You underestimate me!

01:31:03.458 --> 01:31:04.917
I did underestimate you!

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.000
You're wounded, and your strength is ebbing away!

01:31:24.208 --> 01:31:25.417
Eight-armed Ape!

01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:26.875
You'll have a sorry death!

01:31:27.208 --> 01:31:28.667
Go to hell!

01:31:35.708 --> 01:31:36.542
Dragonfly!

01:31:38.167 --> 01:31:39.917
Even if I die,

01:31:41.083 --> 01:31:42.708
I'll never forget your slaps!

01:31:52.292 --> 01:31:54.917
Big Brother's in his grasp too!

01:31:55.833 --> 01:31:57.125
Big Brother!

01:31:57.875 --> 01:31:59.000
You dirty water monster!

01:31:59.083 --> 01:32:00.583
I'll kill you!

01:32:00.667 --> 01:32:02.000
Isn't it me you want?

01:32:02.083 --> 01:32:02.958
I'm right here!

01:32:02.958 --> 01:32:04.708
I'll kill you!

01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:06.542
Dragonfly...

01:32:07.458 --> 01:32:09.792
You'll always be

01:32:10.667 --> 01:32:12.875
the only woman in my heart.

01:32:16.917 --> 01:32:18.625
What a pity!

01:32:19.917 --> 01:32:21.333
Look at you

01:32:21.417 --> 01:32:23.625
Do you know why I can easily defeat you,

01:32:23.708 --> 01:32:26.083
the three best fighters of the Wuyin Clan?

01:32:26.208 --> 01:32:27.833
It's because I'm the best in the world!

01:33:31.833 --> 01:33:33.000
Dragonfly!

01:33:38.375 --> 01:33:39.208
Circle!

01:33:40.583 --> 01:33:41.292
Circle!

01:33:42.083 --> 01:33:42.792
Circle!

01:33:43.417 --> 01:33:44.500
Circle!

01:33:46.875 --> 01:33:47.750
Circle!

01:34:00.333 --> 01:34:02.125
Zhuge...

01:34:02.542 --> 01:34:04.250
Leader Huang Chang!

01:34:05.042 --> 01:34:09.000
Wuyin was born when the first emperor

01:34:09.083 --> 01:34:11.458
used Qimen co-ordinates to fight his foes.

01:34:11.542 --> 01:34:13.292
But this enemy tribe is from beyond the sky,

01:34:13.375 --> 01:34:15.667
so we used the power of Dunjia to fight them.

01:34:16.083 --> 01:34:17.333
After that, though,

01:34:17.417 --> 01:34:20.000
we lost the key to access Dunjia.

01:34:20.083 --> 01:34:22.042
The aliens launched more ruthless attacks.

01:34:22.125 --> 01:34:24.125
The strength of the Wuyin Clan is in decline,

01:34:25.167 --> 01:34:26.625
and the aliens have enormous power.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.333
They're capable of resurrection

01:34:28.417 --> 01:34:30.250
and can live for centuries.

01:34:30.333 --> 01:34:32.000
They've been dormant on our planet,

01:34:32.083 --> 01:34:33.583
waiting for us to disappear slowly.

01:34:34.042 --> 01:34:37.167
They want to rule earth and change our world.

01:34:37.875 --> 01:34:40.042
That's why the Wuyin Clan

01:34:40.125 --> 01:34:42.208
must find a way to survive.

01:34:42.708 --> 01:34:45.125
We've spent our whole lives searching for Dunjia,

01:34:45.208 --> 01:34:47.583
only to find it hidden inside this child.

01:34:48.083 --> 01:34:50.083
I will access the aura of Dunjia

01:34:50.167 --> 01:34:51.542
and instill her with its vigor.

01:34:54.458 --> 01:34:56.667
If she becomes Wuyin Clan's leader,

01:34:56.750 --> 01:34:58.625
the world will definitely be safe.

01:34:58.708 --> 01:34:59.917
We can borrow her body

01:35:00.375 --> 01:35:02.792
to reinstate Dunjia's matchless power.

01:35:03.167 --> 01:35:04.792
That mark on her arm...

01:35:04.875 --> 01:35:06.417
I made it

01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:08.000
so that you would find her and recognize her.

01:35:08.292 --> 01:35:08.958
Leaded

01:35:09.792 --> 01:35:10.458
Leaded

01:35:19.667 --> 01:35:21.083
Circle!

01:35:22.583 --> 01:35:24.125
Circle!

01:35:25.667 --> 01:35:27.000
Circle!

01:35:27.792 --> 01:35:29.125
Brother Zhuge...

01:35:29.625 --> 01:35:31.875
We haven't hugged in ages...

01:35:39.875 --> 01:35:41.083
Circle!

01:35:43.708 --> 01:35:44.667
Circle!

01:35:46.625 --> 01:35:47.667
I'm hugging you!

01:35:49.583 --> 01:35:51.042
I'm hugging you!

01:36:08.458 --> 01:36:10.125
I'm hugging you!

01:36:21.333 --> 01:36:23.042
Circle is gone.

01:36:24.667 --> 01:36:26.708
Now who can lead us?

01:36:27.208 --> 01:36:28.667
She opened up the power of Dunjia

01:36:28.750 --> 01:36:30.083
and shared all her power with us.

01:36:41.708 --> 01:36:46.125
CIRCLE

01:36:46.583 --> 01:36:48.625
The Wuyin Clan has been cornered.

01:36:49.583 --> 01:36:51.583
The power Circle gave us

01:36:51.583 --> 01:36:52.792
will help us change our fortune.

01:36:53.250 --> 01:36:54.500
There's one other thing.

01:36:58.500 --> 01:36:59.333
What do we do about him?

01:37:22.917 --> 01:37:23.958
If you are willing,

01:37:24.042 --> 01:37:25.792
you are welcome to join our clan.

01:37:31.750 --> 01:37:33.250
We'll formally initiate you.

01:37:35.083 --> 01:37:36.875
No more slapping?

01:37:36.958 --> 01:37:38.250
No.

01:37:41.792 --> 01:37:42.583
Thank you!

01:37:54.083 --> 01:37:54.792
Thank you, brothers!

01:38:01.917 --> 01:38:03.458
Welcome to the clan.

01:38:10.458 --> 01:38:11.917
Thanks, Second Brother.

01:38:18.375 --> 01:38:19.375
Please...

01:38:23.333 --> 01:38:24.750
Give me a fierce one!

01:38:24.792 --> 01:38:25.792
Sure.

01:38:36.083 --> 01:38:38.500
Wow! Way too fierce!

01:38:47.208 --> 01:38:50.417
CHAPTER 6: RETURN OF THE DUNJIA

01:39:59.750 --> 01:40:00.750
Red Eye!

01:40:04.208 --> 01:40:05.292
The Destroyer of Worlds!

01:40:48.792 --> 01:40:50.042
Dragonfly, stay clear!

01:43:18.375 --> 01:43:19.792
Circle!

01:43:45.208 --> 01:43:46.667
It's the 'Upstream at Qingming Festival' again.

01:43:46.750 --> 01:43:48.125
You were right.

01:43:48.208 --> 01:43:50.042
There was more to this painting.

01:43:50.125 --> 01:43:52.375
The original painting
is divided into two 'Yin' and 'Yang' parts.

01:43:52.375 --> 01:43:54.500
I found the other part

01:43:54.583 --> 01:43:55.625
in the artist's studio.

01:43:58.792 --> 01:44:00.292
'Downstream at Qingming Festival.'

01:44:01.583 --> 01:44:03.583
Let's put the two paintings together.

01:44:16.292 --> 01:44:18.625
"Red Eye descends from the skies."

01:44:19.542 --> 01:44:21.417
"White Tiger emerges from the land."

01:44:22.458 --> 01:44:24.333
"The firmament opens."

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.875
"The spiritual lord reappears."

01:44:30.708 --> 01:44:32.083
Let's see what else there is.

01:44:35.292 --> 01:44:37.583
That glowing red monster in the sky was Red Eye.

01:44:38.083 --> 01:44:38.833
Her goal

01:44:38.917 --> 01:44:40.417
is to revive their spiritual lord.

01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:41.917
Those aliens hiding on earth

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:43.542
want to pass the painting to Red Eye.

01:44:43.625 --> 01:44:45.208
If their spiritual lord were to come back

01:44:45.958 --> 01:44:48.083
we wouldn't have the power to fight them off.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:49.750
Leaden

01:44:50.167 --> 01:44:52.333
Can you perceive where
their spiritual lord is buried?

01:44:54.417 --> 01:44:55.667
The painting tells us...

01:44:58.417 --> 01:44:59.458
...at Pangu Mausoleum.

01:45:40.667 --> 01:45:41.958
Pangu Mausoleum?

01:45:41.958 --> 01:45:43.750
Okay, I'll go there right now!

01:45:43.833 --> 01:45:45.750
No, Big Brother,
you must stay to guard the base here.

01:45:46.083 --> 01:45:48.375
As the new leader, I should set an example

01:45:48.792 --> 01:45:49.542
and go there myself.

01:45:49.625 --> 01:45:50.292
No way!

01:45:50.500 --> 01:45:51.833
It's a dangerous journey.

01:45:52.292 --> 01:45:54.042
The leader shouldn't go alone.

01:45:54.250 --> 01:45:56.042
Of course I won't go alone.

01:45:56.417 --> 01:45:58.125
I need your geographical knowledge.

01:45:58.208 --> 01:45:59.417
You should accompany me.

01:46:00.125 --> 01:46:01.250
One man and one woman, that's not appropriate!

01:46:01.875 --> 01:46:03.417
Leader, I'll go too.

01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:05.375
That will solve the problem.

01:46:06.750 --> 01:46:08.792
That's right! Dragonfly
has proved herself on the battlefield.

01:46:08.875 --> 01:46:10.458
If you go, I'll feel secure.

01:46:10.542 --> 01:46:12.250
And that way Zhuge and I won't need to overstress.

01:46:12.958 --> 01:46:14.333
Zhuge and I will stay here.

01:46:15.167 --> 01:46:17.875
Sister Dragonfly, please choose some brothers

01:46:17.958 --> 01:46:19.042
and lead this difficult expedition.

01:46:21.625 --> 01:46:22.542
No!

01:46:23.500 --> 01:46:24.833
The others don't have magical abilities.

01:46:24.917 --> 01:46:25.583
It'll be too dangerous.

01:46:26.208 --> 01:46:26.833
Leaden

01:46:26.917 --> 01:46:28.875
I strongly request that I be sent along
with Sister Dragonfly.

01:46:28.958 --> 01:46:31.042
That way, I can build up my combat skills as I go.

01:46:31.458 --> 01:46:32.083
If just the two of you go,

01:46:32.458 --> 01:46:34.083
won't it be a little lightweight?

01:46:34.167 --> 01:46:35.333
You won't be alert enough.

01:46:35.417 --> 01:46:36.625
It's still safer if I go.

01:46:36.708 --> 01:46:38.292
Didn't you say you'd protect me?

01:46:38.375 --> 01:46:39.958
That's right! We don't need you.

01:46:40.042 --> 01:46:41.208
Protect the leader!

01:46:41.208 --> 01:46:43.375
You brothers and sisters with magical powers!

01:46:44.292 --> 01:46:45.792
Could you please give a little chance

01:46:45.875 --> 01:46:46.875
to those of us lesser folks?

01:46:47.208 --> 01:46:49.375
This guy here who lost an arm and a leg

01:46:49.458 --> 01:46:50.667
picked up magical powers

01:46:50.750 --> 01:46:52.167
after the leader healed him!

01:46:52.417 --> 01:46:55.208
And Big Brother, Second Brother,
and Third Sister, too!

01:46:55.875 --> 01:46:57.583
All we're asking for

01:46:57.667 --> 01:46:59.833
is one little chance to sustain a serious injury.

01:46:59.917 --> 01:47:01.042
Yes, yes, yes!

01:47:01.125 --> 01:47:02.250
We can even die!

01:47:06.792 --> 01:47:08.500
Stop!
