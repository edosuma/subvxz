ADDY: Uhh...

34:11.040 --> 34:12.882
Uhh...

34:13.880 --> 34:16.360
- I really hate that one.
- Yeah.

34:22.719 --> 34:25.199
Come on. Come on!

34:38.080 --> 34:41.208
Let's go, man!
Don't stop for nothing!

34:41.360 --> 34:43.761
(COUGHS)

34:55.560 --> 34:57.642
Come on, you guys.
Go, go! Run, kid!

34:57.800 --> 35:00.280
Addy, get out of there!
I got this.

35:05.720 --> 35:07.484
Come on.

35:11.360 --> 35:13.203
-(GUNSHOT)
- Oh, damn!

35:18.160 --> 35:20.322
- Crap!
- Come on!

35:20.480 --> 35:22.642
Where'd he go?
I think I got him.

35:22.800 --> 35:24.643
Alright, nice shooting.
Move your ass. Come on!

35:25.680 --> 35:27.364
Come on, Doc.

35:46.240 --> 35:50.290
- Hey, are we slowing down?
- We need to not slow down!

35:55.160 --> 35:57.891
(WOMAN SCREAMS)

36:01.880 --> 36:04.167
Everybody, hang onto something!

36:11.720 --> 36:13.848
Hey. How's it going back there?

36:14.000 --> 36:16.002
- We need to go faster.
- What?!

36:16.160 --> 36:17.730
- Clutch.
- What?

36:17.880 --> 36:20.360
- Clutch!
-(ENGINE REVS)

36:27.440 --> 36:29.807
MAN: Stop, stop!

36:29.960 --> 36:32.122
Wagon trains, ho!

36:41.440 --> 36:43.966
(LAUGHS) We made it.

36:44.120 --> 36:45.770
Never a doubt.

36:48.400 --> 36:50.243
(CHUCKLES)
Edmonton, here we come.

36:50.400 --> 36:53.529
Oh, damn it.
Custer, there's too many Zs.

36:55.800 --> 36:58.167
I gotta get to Edmonton.

36:58.360 --> 37:01.443
My son and I
used to camp up there.

37:01.600 --> 37:03.841
Boy, he loved to fish.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.729
Doc, let me see your gun.

37:08.400 --> 37:10.767
Zeke...l give you mercy.

37:21.880 --> 37:24.087
Come on, man.
You ain't gonna make it.

37:24.240 --> 37:25.571
You should come with us.

37:28.280 --> 37:29.725
CUSTER: Oh!

37:38.280 --> 37:40.521
- Clutch!
- Yep!

37:51.760 --> 37:53.888
- CUSTER: Man...
-(HONKS HORN)

37:54.080 --> 37:56.401
ADDY: Go! Go!

38:03.280 --> 38:04.884
May God give you mercy.

38:05.040 --> 38:07.202
We'll see you in Edmonton.

38:07.360 --> 38:09.283
Arggh!

(HACKS AND COUGHS)

39:02.720 --> 39:05.166
I've never jumped from
a moving vehicle my whole life,

39:05.360 --> 39:07.362
and now, boom, twice in one day.

39:09.400 --> 39:12.449
(TRUCK HORN BLARES)

39:25.360 --> 39:27.169
WRECKING BALL: I call shotgun!

39:27.320 --> 39:31.086
OK, so you're, like, THE Murphy, then?
Like, for real?

39:31.240 --> 39:34.449
Let's keep that information
to yourself, blabbermouth.

39:35.440 --> 39:39.161
Hey. Let me see you levitate.

39:40.160 --> 39:44.210
It's possible there may
have been some exaggeration

39:44.400 --> 39:46.084
as to the extent
of my abilities.

39:46.240 --> 39:48.163
Oh, yeah.

39:48.360 --> 39:50.727
Yeah, well, I knew that, like,
zombie mind control thing

39:50.880 --> 39:52.689
was, like, totally bogus, so...

39:53.680 --> 39:55.682
Ow! Hey.

39:55.840 --> 39:58.161
She's, like, into
the rough stuff, man, like...

39:58.320 --> 39:59.606
Wait.

39:59.760 --> 40:02.843
Did you make her do that?
Oh, my God.

40:03.040 --> 40:05.646
Ow! Alright, OK. I get it.

40:05.840 --> 40:08.286
To some zombies,
I am their messiah.

40:08.440 --> 40:12.968
To the blasters,
apparently I am their dinner, just like you.

40:13.120 --> 40:15.122
Well, like, their brains
are totally melted,

40:15.280 --> 40:17.681
so there's no psychic dial tone
going on up there.

40:17.840 --> 40:21.083
But your zombie girlfriend there, man,
she, like...

40:22.080 --> 40:24.731
That's your bite.
You turned her!

40:25.720 --> 40:29.805
Oh, that scenario
has some serious implications, man.

40:32.480 --> 40:34.801
You sure about Minneapolis?

40:34.960 --> 40:36.610
Wrecking Ball was going on about

40:36.760 --> 40:38.410
some herbal cure
for the zombie virus

40:38.560 --> 40:40.244
being cooked up in an old

40:40.400 --> 40:42.641
genetically modified food lab
out there.

40:42.800 --> 40:47.886
Uh, hold on.
Marijuana, zombies and GMOs.

40:48.040 --> 40:50.168
(SCOFFS) What could go wrong?

40:54.320 --> 40:57.164
You people really do attract it,
don't you?

40:58.200 --> 41:00.362
Help me with the hitch.

41:02.240 --> 41:05.483
(BOOM!)

41:06.800 --> 41:08.450
A caravan of 20 refugees

41:08.600 --> 41:11.080
leaves Seattle's blast zone
for Edmonton.

41:11.280 --> 41:14.841
They meet six survivors
and one Murphy.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.129
How many refugees survive?

41:24.720 --> 41:26.927
<i>Not one.</i>

41:42.640 --> 41:44.324
MURPHY: You have any more
of that Z-Weed?

41:44.520 --> 41:47.171
Oh... Sorry, dude. Mn-mn.

41:47.320 --> 41:49.368
You understand
why nobody likes you, right?

41:49.520 --> 41:52.091
- Oh, yeah.
- Good. Then look again.

41:53.440 --> 41:55.522
Oh, here it is.

42:00.560 --> 42:03.609
Hold the wheel.

42:14.440 --> 42:17.284
Thanks. I needed that.

42:17.440 --> 42:20.762
So...tell me again
about this lab in Minneapolis.

42:20.920 --> 42:23.287
Well, you know what? You'll see
for yourself when we get there.

42:23.440 --> 42:26.364
I know the guy. He'll give us a tour.
'Cause we're a team now.

42:26.560 --> 42:29.564
He'll let all of us go through there -
we're gonna go out there

42:29.720 --> 42:31.449
and take on the world
together and stuff, man.

42:31.600 --> 42:33.329
It's, like, the three of us
from now on.

42:33.480 --> 42:36.324
We are like
the Three Caballeros, man!

42:41.040 --> 42:43.441

Why is she looking at me that way?
