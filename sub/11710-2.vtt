[KNOCK ON DOOR]

00:06.464 --> 00:08.050
- Hi.
- Hey, Jeff.

00:08.050 --> 00:09.717
Just wanted to return this.

00:09.717 --> 00:12.179
We borrowed it from
your lovely fiancée.

00:12.179 --> 00:15.473
Oh,The Notebook.

00:16.391 --> 00:18.976
Yeah,The Notebook.

00:19.686 --> 00:20.478
Audrey made me watch it.

00:20.478 --> 00:25.525
If you don't mind,
I'm gonna get a beer
and pour it in my eyes.

00:26.193 --> 00:26.818
Hey, Jeff.

00:26.818 --> 00:29.821
Hey, Jennifer,
just returning your movie.

00:29.821 --> 00:32.199
Didn't it make you
want to cry?

00:32.199 --> 00:34.117
Constantly.

00:34.242 --> 00:37.995
Tell Audrey
we're saving the date
for your birthday party.

00:37.995 --> 00:39.831
Great. It should be fun.

00:40.540 --> 00:43.960
That party's gonna suck.

00:43.960 --> 00:45.128
Why?

00:45.128 --> 00:46.879
Because I have to pay for it,

00:46.879 --> 00:48.090
plus spend the whole night

00:48.090 --> 00:50.217
worrying about people
spilling things,

00:50.217 --> 00:51.218
stealin' my stuff.

00:51.218 --> 00:53.010
Your friends sound
really cool.

00:53.010 --> 00:56.056
Why don't you just tell Audrey
you don't want a party?

00:56.056 --> 00:58.808
She loves throwing parties.
It makes her happy.

00:58.808 --> 01:00.685
And if she's happy...

01:00.685 --> 01:03.563
that's good for
my birthday deal.

01:03.563 --> 01:07.192
Oh, yeah,
your birthday deal.

01:07.192 --> 01:10.862
One year I complained too much.
She got mad.

01:10.862 --> 01:13.030
Not good for the birthday deal.

01:13.030 --> 01:15.783
You can't keep talking
about the birthday deal

01:15.783 --> 01:17.952
without telling me
what it is.

01:17.952 --> 01:20.455
What does Audrey do
for you every year?

01:20.455 --> 01:23.708
I wish I could tell ya...
Can't.

01:23.708 --> 01:27.962
If Audrey found out
I told someone,
the deal would be off.

01:27.962 --> 01:29.256
I won't tell her.

01:29.256 --> 01:30.089
Now that we're neighbors,

01:30.089 --> 01:34.302
this is the kind of guy stuff
we should be talking about.

01:36.929 --> 01:39.056
Instead of worrying
about my birthday deal,

01:39.056 --> 01:40.642
why don't you get
one of your own?

01:40.642 --> 01:42.227
Because I don't need one.

01:42.227 --> 01:45.438
With Jennifer,
every day is my birthday.

01:45.438 --> 01:47.607
Every day used to be
my birthday, too.

01:47.607 --> 01:51.027
Could I have been
as stupid as you are?

01:51.027 --> 01:54.322
If I needed a birthday deal,
I could get one.

01:54.322 --> 01:56.574
Don't try to run
with the big boy.

01:56.574 --> 01:58.368
I've been married
for twelve years.

01:58.368 --> 02:01.621
You basically threw a ring
at a stranger.

02:01.621 --> 02:03.123
She's not a stranger.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.291
We've been together
for seven months.

02:04.291 --> 02:07.460
- Plus, I didn't even
get her a ring yet.
- Why not?

02:07.460 --> 02:08.836
I don't know what she likes.

02:08.836 --> 02:11.298
We've only known each other
for seven months.

02:11.298 --> 02:15.218
Wow. You clearly know
what you're doing.

02:16.136 --> 02:19.389
Hey, not only
could I get a deal,

02:19.389 --> 02:23.059
I could get one
that's better than yours.

02:23.059 --> 02:24.352
What's yours?

02:24.352 --> 02:26.103
Nice try.

02:26.103 --> 02:26.938
I'm gettin' a deal.

02:26.938 --> 02:29.732
And then every year
when I'm doin' it,

02:29.732 --> 02:31.984
I'm gonna think of you.

02:37.657 --> 02:40.493
I--I didn't say that.

02:41.328 --> 02:43.330
I didn't hear it.

02:47.375 --> 02:51.338

to say I love you ♪♪

02:51.921 --> 02:57.385

03:10.607 --> 03:12.817
A birthday deal, huh?

03:12.817 --> 03:15.194
Yeah. Jeff's got one
with Audrey.

03:15.194 --> 03:17.196
Yeah, I like it.

03:17.447 --> 03:20.116
It's like a dirty pre-nup.

03:20.116 --> 03:22.577
First I'm just gonna
float the idea,

03:22.577 --> 03:23.536
see if she's receptive.

03:23.536 --> 03:26.789
- Then we gotta figure out
what to ask for.
- We?

03:26.789 --> 03:29.459
Yes, I'm in.
You're welcome.

03:29.459 --> 03:33.921
Now, people's sex lives
don't seem to get wilder

03:33.921 --> 03:35.465
when they get married.

03:35.465 --> 03:38.926
My sex life with Jennifer
is fine.

03:38.926 --> 03:40.470
Just ask our neighbors.

03:40.470 --> 03:44.140
Oh, you bring them over
to watch?

03:44.140 --> 03:46.142
No. No, they just heard...

03:46.142 --> 03:47.935
through pre-war concrete walls.

03:47.935 --> 03:50.897
I'm talkin' four solid inches.

04:00.197 --> 04:03.368
We all agree your fiancée
is a horn dog,

04:03.368 --> 04:05.828
which is why I think
we should ask

04:05.828 --> 04:09.832
for the "Manitoba Sno-Cone."

04:09.832 --> 04:10.750
Stop saying "we."

04:10.750 --> 04:14.003
And I'm not asking for
anything off your list

04:14.003 --> 04:16.881
of humorously named sex acts.

04:16.881 --> 04:21.052
Why not? It took me ten years
to fill this thing out.

04:21.052 --> 04:24.138
Ten beautiful years.

04:24.138 --> 04:30.227
See if she's up for
the "Peppermint Bobsled."

04:30.603 --> 04:34.231
No, I can't do that.
I love this person.

04:35.066 --> 04:37.402
And this would ruin Christmas
forever.

04:37.402 --> 04:39.487
It doesn't have
to be a candy cane.

04:39.487 --> 04:44.033
It would help if we knew what
Jeff's deal with Audrey was.

04:44.033 --> 04:45.868
What does that
giant gorilla get?

04:45.868 --> 04:48.746
I asked him,
but he wouldn't tell me.

04:49.246 --> 04:50.582
What's that?

04:50.582 --> 04:51.583
He wouldn't tell me.

04:51.583 --> 04:54.419
I'm sorry. I thought
we were living in America.

04:54.419 --> 04:56.379
Has Jeff heard of
something called

04:56.379 --> 04:57.922
the Freedom of
Information Act?

04:57.922 --> 05:02.302
He told me that
if Audrey finds out
that he told anyone,

05:02.302 --> 05:03.470
the deal would be off.

05:03.470 --> 05:06.639
Fine. I'll find out
without anybody knowing.

05:06.639 --> 05:09.141
Far be it from me
to jeopardize whatever

05:09.141 --> 05:11.603
he does to his wife annually.

05:12.269 --> 05:18.025
Uh, Russell, you don't know
that's what it is.

05:21.028 --> 05:23.823
"Annually."

05:26.701 --> 05:27.994
Oh.

05:33.500 --> 05:34.667
Audrey, I forgot to tell you--

05:34.667 --> 05:36.961
Russell overheard me
talking about Jeff's party,

05:36.961 --> 05:39.964
and I didn't know if you were
planning on inviting him.

05:39.964 --> 05:42.216
Yeah, he's comin'.

05:43.510 --> 05:44.677
Not my idea.

05:44.677 --> 05:47.764
So, what are you planning
for the party?

05:47.764 --> 05:49.724
Oh, the usual Jeff-fest--

05:49.724 --> 05:52.435
beer, shots, chips,
hot wings,

05:52.435 --> 05:54.604
stadium rock
on the stereo.

05:54.604 --> 05:57.774
Basically the home version
of Hooters.

05:57.774 --> 06:00.568
Not the party I'd throw,
but whatever.

06:00.568 --> 06:03.237
Why don't you throw
the party you want to?

06:03.237 --> 06:04.906
It's Jeff's birthday, you know?

06:04.906 --> 06:07.659
He doesn't even care
what kind of party it is.

06:07.659 --> 06:09.577
He doesn't...care
what kind of party it is--

06:09.577 --> 06:12.038
Why don't I throw
the kind of party I want?

06:12.038 --> 06:15.207
Exactly. It doesn't
have to be Jeff-Fest.

06:15.207 --> 06:18.836
Why not "Audrey-gras"?

06:18.836 --> 06:22.381
'Cause that means "fat Audrey."

06:28.304 --> 06:31.223
Hey. You know what
I just realized?

06:31.223 --> 06:33.100
My birthday's coming up.

06:33.100 --> 06:35.770
You know, in the seven months
we've been together,

06:35.770 --> 06:37.271
we haven't had a birthday yet.

06:37.271 --> 06:41.484
Two big, fun days
to look forward to.

06:41.776 --> 06:42.735
I'm glad you feel that way.

06:42.735 --> 06:47.406
What do you think about
doing something really
special for me?

06:47.406 --> 06:49.867
Sure. What did you
have in mind?

06:49.867 --> 06:53.329
Well, something
in the bedroom department,

06:53.329 --> 06:57.500
a little something
I'd get annually.

07:00.127 --> 07:01.838
Once a year.

07:01.838 --> 07:06.133
Why? Is there
something you want to do
that we're not doing?

07:06.133 --> 07:08.803
No, no. I have no complaints.

07:08.803 --> 07:12.306
Well, that one time
you bit my shoulder

07:12.306 --> 07:13.516
and you drew blood.

07:13.516 --> 07:18.605
But, hey, you know?
That's just the cost
of doing business.

07:18.771 --> 07:23.400
I just thought it would be fun
to have a special...

07:23.400 --> 07:25.402
birth--birthday deal.

07:25.945 --> 07:29.824
That does sound fun.
I want one.

07:29.824 --> 07:30.825
You do?

07:30.825 --> 07:32.994
- Mm-hmm.
- That's great!

07:32.994 --> 07:35.997
That's--I love you!

07:36.122 --> 07:38.708
Oh, and let's say
nothing's off-limits.

07:38.708 --> 07:41.085
Definitely let's say that.

07:43.129 --> 07:43.630
Okay.

07:43.546 --> 07:46.758
I am going to
think about mine
while I'm showering.

07:46.758 --> 07:49.469
Okay. I'm going to
think about you showering

07:49.469 --> 07:53.430
while I'm thinking about mine.

07:53.430 --> 07:54.932
Two birthday deals.

07:54.932 --> 07:58.227
Suck on that, Jeff.

08:08.738 --> 08:12.033
If you're serious about buying
I'll get up, but...

08:12.033 --> 08:14.702
it's not very comfortable.

08:17.079 --> 08:18.581
Hey...

08:18.581 --> 08:19.456
where are the girls?

08:19.456 --> 08:21.834
They're shopping for
mojito glasses.

08:21.834 --> 08:25.171
They're doing
a whole Cuban theme
for my party.

08:25.171 --> 08:26.463
Doesn't sound like your style.

08:26.463 --> 08:30.051
What do I care?
As long as Audrey's
in a great mood

08:30.051 --> 08:32.970
at the end of the party.

08:33.555 --> 08:35.807
Which brings me to my news.

08:35.807 --> 08:38.768
I am now the proud owner
of not one...

08:38.768 --> 08:42.271
but two birthday deals.

08:42.271 --> 08:43.189
Two. No way.

08:43.189 --> 08:45.900
That's right.
What's the matter?

08:45.900 --> 08:49.904
Is my two a little hard
for you to swallow?

09:00.665 --> 09:02.249
Anyway, uh...

09:02.249 --> 09:04.752
I'm gettin' one,
and Jennifer wants one, too.

09:04.752 --> 09:09.381
And get this:
Nothing is off limits.

09:09.381 --> 09:11.801
[CHUCKLING]

09:11.801 --> 09:12.509
Yeah.

09:12.509 --> 09:15.512
You're playing with fire.

09:15.512 --> 09:16.723
How so?

09:16.723 --> 09:18.099
I didn't get a birthday deal

09:18.099 --> 09:20.309
until I'd been married
for six years

09:20.309 --> 09:21.603
and our relationship was stable.

09:21.603 --> 09:23.938
You've known Jennifer
for what, twenty minutes?

09:23.938 --> 09:28.943
Do you really think
you're ready to hear Jennifer's
wildest, craziest fantasy?

09:28.943 --> 09:29.902
Yeah!

09:29.902 --> 09:31.571
The crazier, the better.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.865
Really?

09:34.657 --> 09:38.620
Aren't you worried
she'll want something
so disturbing

09:38.620 --> 09:40.454
you won't be able to
look at her

09:40.454 --> 09:43.916
when you're having brunch
with your parents?

09:45.501 --> 09:48.337
Come on...

09:48.337 --> 09:50.339
I mean, how weird
can it be?

09:50.339 --> 09:53.300
Well, apparently
nothing's off limits.

09:53.300 --> 09:56.596
By the way,
whose idea was that?

09:58.222 --> 09:59.724
Hers.

09:59.724 --> 10:02.184
Like I said,
you're swimming
with sharks.

10:02.184 --> 10:04.896
You said I was
playing with fire.

10:04.896 --> 10:05.855
You are...

10:05.855 --> 10:08.608
and the sharks
don't like it.

10:14.321 --> 10:14.989
You're right.

10:14.989 --> 10:18.868
If Jennifer asks for
something really disturbing
for her birthday deal,

10:18.868 --> 10:20.828
I don't know how
I'll handle it.

10:20.828 --> 10:24.081
My guess is, not well.

10:24.081 --> 10:26.709
Maybe I'm worried
about nothing.

10:26.709 --> 10:28.878
What's the worst
she can ask for?

10:28.878 --> 10:31.798
Props, you in
a cheerleader outfit,

10:31.798 --> 10:34.216
a third party involved,

10:34.216 --> 10:37.970
not necessarily a lady.

10:39.931 --> 10:43.810
It's not that I'm scared
to do something kinky
or different.

10:43.810 --> 10:44.644
I've done plenty of that.

10:44.644 --> 10:48.898
What's bothering me
is that Jennifer's
going to be my wife,

10:48.898 --> 10:50.733
the mother of my children.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.902
We're gonna grow old together.

10:52.902 --> 10:55.863
What kind of kinky stuff?

10:56.197 --> 10:58.490
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, sweetie.

10:58.490 --> 10:59.366
Come with me a second.

10:59.366 --> 11:02.369
I wanna show you
this French press
I wanna buy.

11:02.369 --> 11:03.663
French press,
what's that?

11:03.663 --> 11:06.332
What're we gonna do
with that?

11:09.585 --> 11:11.295
What's that?

11:11.295 --> 11:13.047
It's stuff for your party.

11:13.047 --> 11:14.298
- Both carts?
- Yeah.

11:14.298 --> 11:16.467
We got this really cool pitcher
for the mojitos,

11:16.467 --> 11:19.470
and some funky little glasses,
and glass swizzle sticks,

11:19.470 --> 11:21.388
and these bowls with
palm trees on them.

11:21.388 --> 11:25.852
Why do we need all this stuff,
and what's this costing me?

11:25.852 --> 11:26.978
I don't care.

11:26.978 --> 11:29.063
For once I would like
to throw a party

11:29.063 --> 11:31.523
that does not end
with you in prison

11:31.523 --> 11:33.901
behind a wall
of empty beer cans.

11:33.901 --> 11:37.071
Yeah... Alky-traz.

11:38.697 --> 11:40.657
This year we're
doing it my way.

11:40.657 --> 11:44.245
It's bad enough
we have to have
all those people over--

11:44.245 --> 11:48.040
Jeff, please. You see
how excited I am
about doing this?

11:48.040 --> 11:50.752
Please don't ruin it
for me.

11:50.752 --> 11:53.963
Ruin it. I'm not...

11:53.963 --> 11:54.756
ruinin' anything.

11:54.756 --> 11:58.550
You stay excited, because
I am totally on board.

11:58.550 --> 12:00.803
I love these things!

12:02.721 --> 12:04.807
Is that per bowl?

12:09.436 --> 12:09.937
Hey, you.

12:09.937 --> 12:12.356
I think everyone's
really liking
the Cuban theme.

12:12.356 --> 12:15.234
We should throw parties
like this more often.

12:15.234 --> 12:16.903
Perhaps we should.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.195
You really having fun?

12:18.195 --> 12:22.366
If I was having any more fun,
I'd explode...

12:23.200 --> 12:25.744
killing everyone here.

12:27.704 --> 12:29.248
Hey, Russell.

12:29.248 --> 12:31.417
I gotta talk to you.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.335
By the way,
I was snooping around,

12:33.335 --> 12:34.837
looking for
birthday deal clues,

12:34.837 --> 12:37.631
look what I found--
excellent!

12:37.631 --> 12:39.716
Audrey probably
spanks him with it,

12:39.716 --> 12:43.137
scratches his monkey chest,
slaps him around--

12:43.137 --> 12:43.888
Russell, come on, come on.

12:43.888 --> 12:47.433
This whole birthday deal thing's
driving me crazy.

12:47.433 --> 12:48.851
Jeff thinks I'm in over my head.

12:48.851 --> 12:52.563
Don't listen to Early Man.
This is a good thing.

12:52.563 --> 12:56.317
Yeah, but what if
what Jennifer wants is...

12:56.317 --> 12:58.069
[WHISPERING]
disgusting?

12:58.069 --> 13:01.197
[WHISPERING]
Then you win.

13:01.530 --> 13:03.950
No. No, I don't.
Look, you're single.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.952
You can do anything you want
with a girl

13:05.952 --> 13:08.412
because by the next morning,
you're gone.

13:08.412 --> 13:10.873
Next morning?

13:10.873 --> 13:14.043
- Later that night?
- Mmm.

13:14.043 --> 13:15.044
Whatever!

13:15.044 --> 13:17.296
You never have to
see her again.

13:17.296 --> 13:18.630
I'm with Jennifer forever.

13:18.630 --> 13:24.261
Right. Therein, my friend,
lies your problem.

13:24.761 --> 13:29.976
By the way, that...thing?
It's a scoop for the litter box.

13:34.688 --> 13:36.398
Is it now?

13:38.317 --> 13:40.527
Take care.

13:44.573 --> 13:46.658
- Hey!
- Hey. Hi!

13:46.658 --> 13:50.121
So I think I know what
I want for my birthday deal!

13:50.121 --> 13:50.621
You do?

13:50.537 --> 13:54.583
I'm just worried
that mine might be
a little messy.

13:56.752 --> 13:58.170
Messy. How?

13:58.170 --> 14:03.092
It involves oil and some
other sticky liquids.

14:03.092 --> 14:05.802
It could ruin the sheets.

14:09.265 --> 14:12.268
Okay. Oil and sticky liquids.

14:12.268 --> 14:14.811
Oil and sticky liquids.

14:14.811 --> 14:16.022
Oil...

14:16.022 --> 14:18.399
Oil and sticky liqui--

14:18.399 --> 14:21.443
The "Santa Fe Funnel Cake."

14:26.323 --> 14:28.034
Hey, Audrey.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.202
Hello, Russell.

14:42.464 --> 14:44.133
Anyway...

14:45.885 --> 14:49.889
Big night for Jeff,
wouldn't you say?

14:49.889 --> 14:52.558
Yes. It's his birthday.

14:52.558 --> 14:53.893
Yes, it is.

14:53.893 --> 15:00.649
So, are you gonna
get him a special present?

15:00.649 --> 15:02.859
Uh, this party.

15:04.695 --> 15:06.280
And?

15:08.865 --> 15:10.784
Hmm?

15:10.784 --> 15:11.827
Hmm?

15:11.827 --> 15:14.413
I think we're done here.

15:22.671 --> 15:24.423
Come on!

15:29.261 --> 15:30.721
[SIGHS]

15:36.602 --> 15:38.270
Hey, birthday boy!

15:38.770 --> 15:41.232
How's it goin'?

15:42.149 --> 15:44.110
Better now.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.863
So, I got you a present.

15:47.863 --> 15:48.948
[CHUCKLES]

15:48.948 --> 15:50.366
How'd you like some details

15:50.366 --> 15:52.909
of a little chickie
I was with last week?

15:52.909 --> 15:55.997
That would be
a very thoughtful gift.

15:55.997 --> 15:57.206
All right.

15:57.206 --> 15:58.499
I tell you what.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.667
I'll give you
some juicy deets

16:00.667 --> 16:03.504
if you tell me
what your birthday deal is.

16:03.504 --> 16:05.631
No.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.799
Maybe I'll just ask Audrey.

16:07.799 --> 16:12.346
That would be a very poor
and unhealthy decision.

16:14.140 --> 16:14.806
Think so?

16:14.806 --> 16:17.768
Imagine the Wilkinsons' surprise

16:17.768 --> 16:20.437
when I pound you
through the floor

16:20.437 --> 16:23.315
and into their living room.

16:26.443 --> 16:28.988
Gyeahh...

16:28.988 --> 16:32.658
somebody get a Soloflex?

16:36.703 --> 16:40.082
I'm sorry.
Would you like
some champagne?

16:40.082 --> 16:42.168
Champagne?

16:45.004 --> 16:47.964
[PINGS]
A real glass.

16:53.220 --> 16:56.057
Great! It's fantastic.

16:56.848 --> 16:58.100
What're you doin'?

16:58.100 --> 16:59.476
This is really good champagne.

16:59.476 --> 17:02.854
Why are we giving this
to our friends?

17:03.147 --> 17:05.066
Because it's your birthday.

17:05.066 --> 17:07.359
Look at all these bottles!

17:07.359 --> 17:09.695
I tried to bite my tongue,
but I--I'm sorry.

17:09.695 --> 17:12.698
This is way too much.
This night must've
cost a fortune.

17:12.698 --> 17:15.701
Why do you always have to
put a price tag on things?

17:15.701 --> 17:16.868
Because "things" cost money.

17:16.868 --> 17:20.497
I'm just sayin' we could've
done this party for a lot less.

17:20.497 --> 17:23.167
Fine. I give up.

17:23.667 --> 17:24.626
You know what's ironic?

17:24.626 --> 17:26.628
That champagne was for
a toast I was going to give

17:26.628 --> 17:31.592
to tell all our friends what
a sweet, special generous man
you are.

17:31.967 --> 17:35.804
I guess I can't do that now,
can I?

17:38.515 --> 17:43.062
Excuse me, everyone.
I'd like to make a toast.

17:43.229 --> 17:46.940
I'd like to thank you all
for coming to my party,

17:46.940 --> 17:47.733
but more importantly,

17:47.733 --> 17:50.736
I would like to
take a moment
to thank Audrey

17:50.736 --> 17:53.989
for all her hard work
in putting it together.

17:53.989 --> 17:57.076
It's much nicer
and classier than I deserve,

17:57.076 --> 17:59.703
but, then again...
so is she.

17:59.703 --> 18:02.914
Audrey, would you
come here for a minute?

18:07.711 --> 18:09.130
To Audrey.

18:09.130 --> 18:11.132
ALL: To Audrey!

18:11.132 --> 18:12.966
[GLASSES CLINKING]

18:15.886 --> 18:18.097
Finish every drop.

18:19.806 --> 18:22.476
Seriously,
it's very expensive.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.482
That was a great party.

18:28.482 --> 18:29.441
Yes, it was.

18:29.441 --> 18:34.155
I have decided what
I want for my birthday deal.
Have you?

18:35.156 --> 18:36.948
Shall I go first?

18:36.948 --> 18:39.368
Yeah. Let's do this.

18:41.995 --> 18:43.330
Okay...

18:43.997 --> 18:48.919
On my birthday every year...
I want...

18:50.045 --> 18:52.381
a foot massage as soon
as I wake up,

18:52.381 --> 18:53.632
then breakfast in bed,

18:53.632 --> 18:55.134
fresh homemade
blueberry pancakes

18:55.134 --> 18:58.595
with expensive champagne
and fresh-squeezed orange juice.

18:58.595 --> 18:59.971
Then a back massage.

18:59.971 --> 19:04.560
Then I go back to sleep
and you clean the apartment.

19:05.311 --> 19:09.398
Then when you're finished,
you come back to bed...

19:09.398 --> 19:12.984
you get under the covers...

19:12.984 --> 19:16.071
and we watch The Notebook.

19:20.659 --> 19:25.706
That's it?
No crazy sex fantasy?

19:25.706 --> 19:26.915
No.

19:26.915 --> 19:27.416
Why not?

19:27.374 --> 19:30.794
Because sex-wise I can get
anything I want from you

19:30.794 --> 19:31.670
any day of the year.

19:31.670 --> 19:34.465
I mean, I'm a girl
and you're a guy.

19:34.465 --> 19:36.425
That's true.

19:36.425 --> 19:38.635
So, for my birthday,
I should get something

19:38.635 --> 19:41.430
I can't get any other day
of the year.

19:41.430 --> 19:42.055
So that's it.

19:42.055 --> 19:45.267
Oh...that's the girl
I'm gonna marry.

19:45.267 --> 19:46.935
I love you.

19:48.103 --> 19:49.563
So, what's yours?

19:49.563 --> 19:52.399
Oh! I wrote it down.

19:55.110 --> 19:57.238
The Velvet Hat Trick?

19:57.238 --> 20:01.700
Yeah. The description's
on the back.

20:02.701 --> 20:05.704
Oh, that's not how I do it.

20:17.132 --> 20:18.634
I wish you'd let me
tell people

20:18.634 --> 20:21.470
that your birthday deal
involves coming here

20:21.470 --> 20:23.054
to recreate our first date.

20:23.054 --> 20:26.725
People should know
how sweet you are.

20:26.725 --> 20:29.811
It's best if only you know.

20:30.437 --> 20:32.606
Even that's pushin' it.

20:32.606 --> 20:35.734
I'm going to
the ladies' room.
