WEBVTT

00:01.485 --> 00:05.004
Hey there,
all my Successful Super Moms.

00:05.006 --> 00:07.489
This is Beth Reidman
coming to you live

00:07.491 --> 00:11.659
from my son Bryson's
12th birthday party!

00:11.661 --> 00:15.681
I am gonna show you
how a Successful Super Mom--

00:15.683 --> 00:18.183
or Dad-- throws a birthday bash.

00:18.185 --> 00:21.245
(quietly): Oh, and there's
the birthday boy right now.

00:21.247 --> 00:23.263
How are you enjoying the party?

00:24.416 --> 00:26.917
Oops. Technical difficulties.
(chuckles awkwardly)

00:26.919 --> 00:29.177
Or maybe you could be
a normal mom

00:29.179 --> 00:30.921
and not go live on the Gram.

00:30.923 --> 00:32.256
And disappoint my sponsors

00:32.258 --> 00:33.866
who were generous enough
to give us all this stuff

00:33.868 --> 00:35.868
-for free, by the way?
-But it's so lame.

00:35.870 --> 00:38.111
I can't believe
you made me wear this.

00:38.113 --> 00:39.596
Why couldn't we
just do paintball

00:39.598 --> 00:41.874
or laser tag, like I wanted?
This stuff is for babies.

00:41.876 --> 00:43.283
Too violent.
Those games are like

00:43.285 --> 00:46.119
simulated war--
I can't put that on my blog.

00:46.121 --> 00:48.196
Oh, so this party is for you?

00:48.198 --> 00:49.864
To give you content
for your blog?

00:49.866 --> 00:52.292
My blog and all the sponsored
content is what pays the bills

00:52.294 --> 00:54.945
-around here.
-You're embarrassing me
in front of my friends.

00:54.947 --> 00:56.221
What are you talking about?

00:56.223 --> 00:58.782
Everyone is having a great time.

00:58.784 --> 01:01.685
The trampoline is a hit.

01:02.788 --> 01:03.970
BRYSON:
Everything here

01:03.972 --> 01:05.547
is for babies.

01:05.549 --> 01:06.790
I'm 12, Mom.

01:06.792 --> 01:08.292
So I guess that means
you don't want to play

01:08.294 --> 01:10.569
pin the tail on the donkey?

01:10.571 --> 01:13.221
BRYSON:
Pin the tail on the donkey?

01:14.224 --> 01:16.742
I think I liked it better
when you had a real job.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.485
("Chicken Dance" playing)

01:18.487 --> 01:20.395
What do I have to do
to prove to her

01:20.397 --> 01:23.731
I'm not a kid anymore,
pay taxes?

01:23.733 --> 01:24.750
(electronic ding)

01:24.752 --> 01:27.828
And now for a party favorite,

01:27.830 --> 01:29.996
pin the tail on the donkey!

01:29.998 --> 01:32.240
This game is a classic
that is guaranteed

01:32.242 --> 01:35.260
to keep the kids having fun.

01:35.262 --> 01:37.596
BOY:
We're not eight years old.

01:37.598 --> 01:38.839
Come on, guys, try it.

01:38.841 --> 01:40.415
It's fun!

01:40.417 --> 01:44.103
-BOY: Mm, nah.
-Okay. I guess I'll go first.

01:44.105 --> 01:45.771
Your mom's
really into this party.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.606
-It's kind of weird.
-Shut up.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.525
â™ª

01:52.504 --> 01:53.261
I hate...

01:53.263 --> 01:55.197
this stupid... party!

01:57.176 --> 01:59.767
(Beth screams, shrieks)

01:59.769 --> 02:01.286
-Mom!
-(others gasping)

02:04.350 --> 02:05.958
I was jumping on the trampoline,

02:05.960 --> 02:07.701
-and a spring flew off.
-Okay.

02:07.703 --> 02:08.869
And it almost killed me.

02:08.871 --> 02:10.445
All right,
let's see what we got.

02:11.781 --> 02:14.858
-(Beth whimpers)
-Looks like she's pinned
to the wall in two places.

02:14.860 --> 02:16.193
All right.
Let's go, let's go.

02:16.195 --> 02:18.028
HEN:
Ma'am, don't move.

02:18.030 --> 02:19.212
Any movement could cause
that spring to shift,

02:19.214 --> 02:21.214
and that would not be good.

02:21.216 --> 02:22.532
Must've been traveling
at top speed.

02:22.534 --> 02:24.810
Put a hole
right through her hand.

02:24.812 --> 02:26.203
-And her torso.
-BETH: Ow.

02:26.205 --> 02:27.462
-Is she gonna be okay?
-Give us some space.

02:27.464 --> 02:29.130
We're gonna take
real good care of your mom,

02:29.132 --> 02:29.982
-I promise.
-Can you move your fingers?

02:29.984 --> 02:32.058
I think so.

02:33.228 --> 02:35.320
Good. Means the spring
likely missed the tendon.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.397
-No nerve damage.
-Oh, thank God.
It's my selfie hand.

02:37.399 --> 02:39.733
HEN:
Pulse is slightly elevated,
but BP's normal.

02:39.735 --> 02:42.161
Miraculously, she's stable.

02:42.163 --> 02:43.478
Getting bilateral breath sounds.

02:43.480 --> 02:45.555
Spring likely didn't puncture
her lungs,

02:45.557 --> 02:47.908
but it's probably millimeters
away from her spine.

02:47.910 --> 02:49.075
I can pack the wound,
but I don't know

02:49.077 --> 02:50.335
how to detach her from the barn.

02:50.337 --> 02:53.563
We don't. Transport her
with it, donkey and all.

02:53.565 --> 02:54.822
Where's Buck?

02:54.824 --> 02:56.199
This is a circular saw.

02:56.201 --> 02:57.901
This blade is strong enough
to cut through anything.

02:57.903 --> 03:00.012
-Cool.
-Even metal.

03:00.014 --> 03:01.996
I'll bet it could slice
through bone, too.

03:01.998 --> 03:03.590
-Uh, yeah, we don't...
-Buck! We need that saw.

03:03.592 --> 03:06.243
-I gotta go. Sorry.
-You went really hard-core

03:06.245 --> 03:07.686
with this party design.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.188
BETH:
It's my job.

03:09.190 --> 03:11.097
Literally. I run a mommy blog.
I spent months

03:11.099 --> 03:12.416
planning this thing, trying to

03:12.418 --> 03:14.193
make it perfect,
and my kid hates me for it.

03:14.195 --> 03:15.677
He doesn't hate you.
He's just 12.

03:15.679 --> 03:17.771
-He'll get over it.
-Feels like no matter what I do,

03:17.773 --> 03:20.032
-it's wrong.
-You did a great job
constructing the shed.

03:20.034 --> 03:22.016
-Really quality work.
-It was from a kit.

03:22.018 --> 03:23.351
I didn't even pick it out.

03:23.353 --> 03:24.594
A sponsor sent it.

03:24.596 --> 03:27.247
Well, at least
you have help taking it down.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.628
BUCK:
Almost there.

03:33.622 --> 03:34.630
Last one, Cap.

03:35.774 --> 03:37.382
(Beth whimpering)

03:37.384 --> 03:39.443
EDDIE:
Okay, so,
phase one was a success,

03:39.445 --> 03:42.462
but there's no way we get her
in this door in the ambulance.

03:42.464 --> 03:45.131
-We got to call for a flatbed.
-We got a penetrating trauma.

03:45.133 --> 03:48.802
-I don't think we can wait.
-Got any other options?

03:48.804 --> 03:51.563
(siren wailing, horn honking)

03:55.885 --> 03:58.144
-(moans)
-Easy, guys, easy.

03:58.146 --> 03:59.071
-Watch the springs.
-Easy.

03:59.073 --> 04:01.131
-Good work.
-Oh, Mom!

04:01.133 --> 04:02.816
-I got your phone!
-Thank you, sweetie.

04:02.818 --> 04:05.577
I'm sorry I treated you like
a little kid. You were right.

04:05.579 --> 04:08.396
-I'm just gonna go back
to my soul-sucking job.
-But, Mom,

04:08.398 --> 04:10.490
I don't think
you should give up the blog.

04:10.492 --> 04:12.084
Look.

04:12.086 --> 04:14.586
Oh, my God.
I was live the whole time?

04:14.588 --> 04:17.756
Look. You're trending.
You're gonna be Internet-famous.

04:17.758 --> 04:19.091
We're gonna be rich!

04:19.093 --> 04:22.427
Oh! I am monetizing parenthood!

04:22.429 --> 04:23.762
Ow!

04:27.826 --> 04:29.326
<i> KAREN:</i>
<i> Hey, sweetie.</i>

04:29.328 --> 04:31.661
-What are you doing up?
-Can I sleep with you and Mama?

04:31.663 --> 04:32.938
Well, of course.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.089
Get on up in here.

04:35.091 --> 04:35.941
HEN:
You have a bad dream?

04:35.943 --> 04:38.259
No.

04:38.261 --> 04:41.530
Mm, you just want to cuddle,
that's it.

04:42.599 --> 04:43.857
You okay?

04:43.859 --> 04:46.118
You're worried about tomorrow.

04:46.120 --> 04:47.861
About Nia leaving.

04:47.863 --> 04:49.362
I don't want her to go away.

04:49.364 --> 04:51.348
I know I get mad at her
sometimes.

04:51.350 --> 04:54.459
I just don't want her to leave.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.853
Neither do we.

04:56.855 --> 04:58.797
It's like we talked about.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.206
Nia came to live with us,

05:00.208 --> 05:02.208
because her real mom
couldn't take care of her.

05:02.210 --> 05:04.803
But now her mom is better,

05:04.805 --> 05:06.379
so Nia gets to go home to her.

05:06.381 --> 05:10.976
Now, that's gonna hurt for us,
but it'll be good for Nia.

05:10.978 --> 05:13.312
You're not my real moms.

05:13.314 --> 05:16.481
Are you gonna have
to give me back, too?

05:17.300 --> 05:20.377
Denny, we are your real moms.

05:20.379 --> 05:24.397
We're your mothers
in every way that matters.

05:24.399 --> 05:28.327
And no one is ever
taking you away from us.

05:28.329 --> 05:31.905
We even have a piece of paper
from a judge that says so.

05:31.907 --> 05:34.057
Did my real... (sighs)

05:34.059 --> 05:38.003
Did my<i> other</i> mom not want me?

05:42.901 --> 05:45.827
Sweetie, she was sick,

05:45.829 --> 05:48.213
and she wasn't in a place

05:48.215 --> 05:50.090
where she could
take care of you.

05:50.092 --> 05:54.335
And it was a hard decision,

05:54.337 --> 05:57.022
but she wanted the best
for you.

05:57.024 --> 05:59.265
And that's why
she gave you to us.

05:59.267 --> 06:02.102
So we could love and protect you

06:02.104 --> 06:04.421
and be your moms forever.

06:04.423 --> 06:07.699
So, nobody's gonna come
and take me away?

06:07.701 --> 06:09.926
Not ever.

06:09.928 --> 06:12.579
I promise.

06:17.769 --> 06:19.119
<i> DENNY:</i>
<i> Here.</i>

06:19.121 --> 06:21.696
I didn't like it
when you took it off my bed,

06:21.698 --> 06:24.257
but I want you to have it
so you can remember me.

06:27.129 --> 06:30.204
And don't forget him.
I know he's your favorite.

06:30.206 --> 06:32.557
You play later with me?

06:32.559 --> 06:34.467
I don't think I can.

06:34.469 --> 06:35.685
Oh.

06:39.566 --> 06:43.885
You're going home
to your mommy today, remember?

06:43.887 --> 06:45.570
Denny come with me?

06:45.572 --> 06:47.297
Not this time.

06:47.299 --> 06:51.410
Why don't you say goodbye?

06:52.137 --> 06:54.579
(sniffles)

06:54.581 --> 06:56.373
Oh, that's a good hug.

06:57.400 --> 07:00.127
(sniffles)
I'm gonna miss those.

07:00.829 --> 07:03.813
Hey. You know, we, uh...

07:03.815 --> 07:05.924
we never gave this...

07:05.926 --> 07:07.984
this guy a name.

07:07.986 --> 07:09.911
-What are you gonna call him?
-Denny!

07:09.913 --> 07:13.390
For... for big brother.

07:15.844 --> 07:19.496
That's great.
That's great.

07:19.498 --> 07:22.524
He'll look after you,
just like a big brother.

07:24.093 --> 07:26.486
(voice breaking):
We love you, Nia.

07:26.488 --> 07:28.196
(sniffles)

07:28.932 --> 07:31.098
Always remember that.

07:31.100 --> 07:33.326
I love you, too, Mama Hen.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.330
You ready, Nia?

07:39.108 --> 07:41.126
Ready.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.110
-See you later.
-HEN: No.

07:43.112 --> 07:45.964
-Sweetie.
-No, we will...
we will see you later.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.115
We love you.

07:48.117 --> 07:51.428
I love you, too.

07:53.031 --> 07:55.307
(door closes)

07:56.660 --> 07:58.384
(Karen sighs)

07:58.386 --> 08:02.055
Hey, Denny, why don't you head
into the kitchen?

08:02.057 --> 08:04.708
I think your grandma's
making you a special lunch.

08:04.710 --> 08:06.526
Okay.

08:10.824 --> 08:13.216
KAREN (sighs):
When we, uh...

08:13.218 --> 08:15.327
When we took her in,

08:15.329 --> 08:18.330
we weren't thinking about the
day we'd have to give her back.

08:18.332 --> 08:21.241
-Yeah.
-That it would be this hard.

08:21.243 --> 08:23.743
I know. I've been doing this
a long time.

08:23.745 --> 08:26.153
And it's never easy.

08:26.155 --> 08:29.065
It's not for everyone.
A lot of folks

08:29.067 --> 08:31.343
never go back
for a second placement.

08:31.345 --> 08:36.923
Yeah. I guess that's something
we have to think about

08:36.925 --> 08:38.908
and discuss.

08:38.910 --> 08:41.244
There's nothing to discuss.

08:41.246 --> 08:44.314
I never want to do this again.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.986
(Karen gasps, sniffles)

08:57.279 --> 08:59.929
You're gonna be late
if you keep watching her.

08:59.931 --> 09:02.282
CHIMNEY: (sighs)
You sure you're gonna

09:02.284 --> 09:05.192
be okay on your own?
I hate to leave you guys.

09:05.194 --> 09:06.545
-Yeah, we'll be fine.
-(Albert shrieks, thuds)

09:06.547 --> 09:10.273
-Whoa. What the...?
-I'll go. You stay here.

09:10.275 --> 09:12.442
-Albert, what happened?
-Yeah.

09:12.444 --> 09:14.961
I was trying to get something
off the shelf.

09:14.963 --> 09:16.279
I lost my balance.

09:16.281 --> 09:18.298
Why didn't you ask
for me or Maddie?

09:18.300 --> 09:21.134
You already have a baby to take
care of. You don't need two.

09:21.136 --> 09:23.061
What we don't need
is you hurting yourself

09:23.063 --> 09:25.138
because you're too stubborn
to ask for help.

09:25.140 --> 09:27.399
I should be better.
The accident was weeks ago.

09:27.401 --> 09:28.975
The doctor said
there would be lingering issues,

09:28.977 --> 09:30.794
balance being one of them.

09:30.796 --> 09:32.553
You just got to be patient.

09:32.555 --> 09:35.632
And quit trying to do
stuff on your own. Let us help.

09:35.634 --> 09:37.058
Are you going out?

09:37.060 --> 09:39.060
Yeah, first day back to work.

09:39.062 --> 09:40.561
We talked about that, remember?

09:40.563 --> 09:44.065
Maybe. Still feels like
my brain's in a fog sometimes.

09:44.067 --> 09:45.399
-(watch beeping)
-(Chimney sighs)

09:45.401 --> 09:48.995
I got to go. Listen,
Maddie will be here with you.

09:48.997 --> 09:50.496
If you need something, ask.

09:50.498 --> 09:52.239
-Please.
-Maybe I could
make her breakfast,

09:52.241 --> 09:53.483
help her for a change.

09:53.485 --> 09:56.094
-(sighs)
-And it would be good practice.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.154
Does Maddie like waffles?

09:58.156 --> 10:00.173
Let's not overdo it, okay?

10:00.175 --> 10:01.749
Just get some rest, Albert.

10:01.751 --> 10:03.935
Don't worry about breakfast.

10:03.937 --> 10:07.513
Feels like all I do is rest.

10:08.516 --> 10:10.942
-Is he okay?
-Little mishap with a shelf.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.169
I'll deal with it
when I get home.

10:13.171 --> 10:15.697
You look really handsome
for your first day back.

10:16.766 --> 10:18.099
-Sexy, too.
-Ah.

10:18.101 --> 10:19.618
Well, you're gonna have
to hold that thought.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.769
There's nothing we can do
about it while we're out here

10:21.771 --> 10:23.363
sleeping on an air mattress.

10:23.365 --> 10:25.365
Yeah. I love you.
Have a great first day.

10:25.367 --> 10:27.367
Love you, too. And text me
if she does anything cute.

10:27.369 --> 10:29.185
Oh, okay.
So, like, every other minute?

10:29.187 --> 10:32.021
-Exactly.
-(laughs softly)

10:32.023 --> 10:34.299
That's the first time
she smiled.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.951
Sure that's a smile?
That's the same face

10:36.953 --> 10:37.952
Buck makes when he's gassy.

10:37.954 --> 10:39.529
I will take that
as a compliment,

10:39.531 --> 10:42.548
'cause it just means
she looks like her Uncle Buck.

10:42.550 --> 10:45.218
God, I love her so much.
I don't even feel like

10:45.220 --> 10:47.128
the same person anymore.
Is that weird?

10:47.130 --> 10:48.554
What's that saying?
Having a kid is like

10:48.556 --> 10:50.464
walking around with your heart
outside your body.

10:50.466 --> 10:52.466
Okay, that's weirder.
And morbid.

10:52.468 --> 10:54.301
Just means it's a whole
different kind of love.

10:54.303 --> 10:57.322
How's Maddie doing?
First solo shift with the baby.

10:57.324 --> 11:00.492
Babies. Plural. She's pulling
double duty. Albert and Jee-Yun.

11:00.494 --> 11:03.811
Offer still stands, you know.
He can come back to my place.

11:03.813 --> 11:05.388
He needs round-the-clock care.

11:05.390 --> 11:07.999
He can't be on his own
for a whole 24 hours.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.834
With the new schedule,
one of us is always home.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.895
If you and Maddie are working
opposite schedules, when do you

11:11.897 --> 11:14.339
-actually see each other?
-Haven't quite
figured that out yet.

11:14.341 --> 11:17.324
Oh, uh, she-she's coming.
(clears throat)

11:17.326 --> 11:19.903
CHIMNEY:
So, uh, yeah. The doctor said
Albert's physical therapy

11:19.905 --> 11:21.996
is going great.

11:21.998 --> 11:23.348
HEN (singsongy):
Welcome back!

11:23.350 --> 11:27.352
Hey! I was just filling them in
on Albert's recovery.

11:28.689 --> 11:31.097
I am disappointed in you guys.

11:31.099 --> 11:33.099
Where's the banner?
Where's the balloons?

11:33.101 --> 11:36.194
This is not how we do when
somebody comes back to work.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.679
I said it was okay.
I don't need that kind of stuff.

11:38.681 --> 11:40.773
-Not when, uh...
-No, no, no, no. We celebrate

11:40.775 --> 11:43.993
every good moment.
When we can.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.263
Now, let me see
these baby pictures.

11:47.265 --> 11:49.098
Okay.
(chuckles)

11:49.100 --> 11:51.192
(all laugh)

11:51.194 --> 11:54.120
Oh, my God,
she's so big already.

11:54.122 --> 11:57.198
-Yeah. They grow up fast.
-Aw.

11:57.200 --> 11:58.866
(alarm ringing)

11:58.868 --> 12:00.960
â™ª<i> Ah, yeah</i> â™ª

12:00.962 --> 12:03.763
â™ª

12:07.877 --> 12:09.394
(grunts)

12:13.567 --> 12:17.277
Ow. Ow.
(spits)

12:18.129 --> 12:19.629
(spits)

12:19.631 --> 12:21.364
Ow.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.412
-Oh! (groans)
-(crack)

12:27.414 --> 12:28.496
Crap.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.644
(whispering): Maybe both legs.
(panting)

12:34.646 --> 12:36.312
Please, you have to send help.
I can't move.

12:36.314 --> 12:38.072
What's your name
and location, sir?

12:38.074 --> 12:40.333
2016 Irvine Street.

12:40.335 --> 12:41.818
-And your name?
<i> -I don't see why that matters.</i>

12:41.820 --> 12:42.835
Please,

12:42.837 --> 12:44.596
<i> just send someone, quietly.</i>

12:44.598 --> 12:45.930
Why are you whispering?

12:45.932 --> 12:47.006
<i> TRISH:</i>
<i> Yes, we heard a crash outside.</i>

12:47.008 --> 12:48.491
Where are you right now?

12:48.493 --> 12:49.917
Can you see
if the intruder is armed?

12:49.919 --> 12:51.010
<i> I'm in the bedroom.</i>
<i> I don't know,</i>

12:51.012 --> 12:52.996
uh, I don't know if he's armed.

12:52.998 --> 12:55.014
Tell them to send
the police, Trish.

12:55.016 --> 12:57.166
I am.
Uh, can you please

12:57.168 --> 12:58.835
send the police?
We're at

12:58.837 --> 13:02.429
<i> 2016 Irvine Street.</i>

13:02.431 --> 13:04.932
Ma'am, i-is there
anyone else in your home

13:04.934 --> 13:06.433
that might have also called 911?

13:06.435 --> 13:08.602
No, it's just-just
me and my husband.

13:08.604 --> 13:10.029
<i> Why?</i>

13:11.440 --> 13:15.126
Josh, why are you sending
police units to my broken leg?

13:15.128 --> 13:18.021
Homeowners called and said
there was a burglar outside.

13:18.023 --> 13:18.963
That must be your guy.

13:18.965 --> 13:21.724
My broken leg was breaking in?

13:21.726 --> 13:23.192
Yeah.

13:23.194 --> 13:24.636
Sir, uh, the address
you gave me--

13:24.638 --> 13:27.530
-is this your residence?
<i> -CONNOR (whispering): Yes.</i>

13:27.532 --> 13:28.139
Yes.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.033
<i> At least it used to be.</i>

13:30.035 --> 13:31.292
I'm gonna need your name.

13:31.294 --> 13:33.202
(sirens wailing, horn honking)

13:34.055 --> 13:36.630
CHIMNEY:
All right, let's
see what we got here.

13:36.632 --> 13:37.540
Connor!

13:37.542 --> 13:38.875
-(groans)
-HEN: Got a compound

13:38.877 --> 13:39.818
tib-fib fracture
to the right leg.

13:39.820 --> 13:41.227
It's pretty nasty.

13:41.229 --> 13:43.137
Got some bone hanging out.

13:43.139 --> 13:45.139
Sir, can you feel
when I do this?

13:45.141 --> 13:46.491
-Oh, God. Yeah, yeah.
-Good. Then his pedal pulse

13:46.493 --> 13:48.234
is strong, which means
he's still got blood flowing.

13:48.236 --> 13:49.810
CHIMNEY:
PERRLA response is good.

13:49.812 --> 13:51.145
Pupils are equal and reactive.

13:51.147 --> 13:52.330
All right, sir,
I'm gonna give you something

13:52.332 --> 13:53.739
to help with the pain,
but you have

13:53.741 --> 13:54.999
to try and stay still.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.242
After a fall like that,
we can't rule out

13:56.244 --> 13:58.837
-spinal injury.
-This is all your fault.

13:58.839 --> 14:00.913
I wasn't the one
climbing up the trellis

14:00.915 --> 14:02.156
like some two-bit cat burglar.

14:02.158 --> 14:03.733
It's 'cause you kicked me out.

14:03.735 --> 14:06.235
Okay? It was either sneak in
or sleep in my car.

14:06.237 --> 14:07.995
You had plenty of other options.

14:07.997 --> 14:11.349
Like-- I don't know--
get a job, pay rent.

14:11.351 --> 14:14.077
You don't need rent!
You're rich!

14:14.079 --> 14:15.019
It's called hard work
paying off.

14:15.021 --> 14:16.170
TRISH:
Will you stop being

14:16.172 --> 14:17.413
so hard on him?

14:17.415 --> 14:19.082
-(siren wailing)
-He's just going through

14:19.084 --> 14:20.416
a quarter-life crisis.

14:20.418 --> 14:22.343
-That's a load of...
-That's a real thing.

14:22.345 --> 14:24.845
-I've been there.
-You need to stop enabling him.

14:24.847 --> 14:28.032
You want to be the good cop, so
you always make me the bad cop.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.760
-I'm sick of it.
-Can't you both be good cops?

14:30.762 --> 14:32.019
-No.
-No.
-No.

14:32.021 --> 14:34.455
Let's get him on a backboard.

14:36.025 --> 14:38.101
But does tough love
actually work, or does it

14:38.103 --> 14:39.210
just make your kid hate you?

14:39.212 --> 14:41.028
Some kids need discipline.

14:41.030 --> 14:42.380
-But not too much.
-I'm curious to know what

14:42.382 --> 14:44.290
your definition
of "too much discipline" is.

14:44.292 --> 14:46.217
All right, one, two, three.

14:46.219 --> 14:49.946
Officer? I'd like you
to arrest this man.

14:49.948 --> 14:51.222
HEN:
You want her

14:51.224 --> 14:52.448
-to arrest your son?
-They're related?

14:52.450 --> 14:54.450
We have a restraining order
against him.

14:54.452 --> 14:57.787
He wouldn't leave. He was
taking us for everything we got.

14:57.789 --> 14:58.897
I had to do something.

14:58.899 --> 15:00.306
Are you gonna arrest him?

15:00.308 --> 15:03.459
You might want
to check this out first.

15:03.461 --> 15:06.295
Looks like the bolts have
been snapped, real clean breaks.

15:06.297 --> 15:07.888
That's why the kid fell down.

15:07.890 --> 15:09.482
Any idea how that happened?

15:09.484 --> 15:12.226
-Nope, no idea.
-Well, you were up there

15:12.228 --> 15:14.395
a few days ago repairing it.

15:14.397 --> 15:16.230
-What kind of repairs?
-HARV: Yeah.

15:16.232 --> 15:18.157
-Just, uh, some basic stuff.
-CONNOR: It was fine

15:18.159 --> 15:20.143
-the last time I broke in.
-See?

15:20.145 --> 15:21.827
That's what I'm talking about.

15:21.829 --> 15:23.922
He's been breaking in for weeks.

15:23.924 --> 15:25.498
He needed to be taught a lesson.

15:25.500 --> 15:27.741
Are you saying that you knew
your son was using the trellis,

15:27.743 --> 15:31.837
and you cut it intentionally
to cause bodily harm?

15:31.839 --> 15:34.098
To your own flesh and blood.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.509
You've coddled him too long,
Trish.

15:36.511 --> 15:40.146
You need to decide
whose side you're on.

15:40.999 --> 15:42.165
<i> TRISH:</i>
<i> Is he gonna</i>

15:42.167 --> 15:43.516
-be okay?
-Well, he'll need surgery,

15:43.518 --> 15:45.610
and it'll be a long recovery,
but he'll make it.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.428
Don't worry, sweetheart.
Mommy will take care of you.

15:47.430 --> 15:49.522
-Trish, you're making a mistake!
-(siren chirps)

15:49.524 --> 15:51.932
You know what?
Find a new place to live, Harv.

15:51.934 --> 15:53.509
-I'm changing the locks.
-(car door closes)

15:53.511 --> 15:55.119
Interesting
parenting techniques.

15:55.121 --> 15:59.015
Yeah. That kid is never
growing up.

15:59.017 --> 16:00.667
(chuckles)

16:06.949 --> 16:09.258
(sighs)

16:15.624 --> 16:17.049
(groans)

16:17.051 --> 16:18.701
You're home.
I am running so late.

16:18.703 --> 16:20.219
-(Jee-Yun crying)
-Jee's having a fussy morning.

16:20.221 --> 16:23.297
She cries every time
I put her down.

16:23.299 --> 16:24.649
Um, I fed her an hour ago
so you're good for two.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.375
There's breast milk in
the fridge, but not much else.

16:26.377 --> 16:27.801
So maybe you could get
some groceries?

16:27.803 --> 16:29.061
Oh, and don't forget, Albert has

16:29.063 --> 16:30.822
his physical therapy
at 3:00 p.m., okay?

16:30.824 --> 16:32.824
Love you. I love you. Bye.

16:32.826 --> 16:34.158
(door closes)

16:34.160 --> 16:36.828
(sighs)
Did you get all that?

16:36.830 --> 16:39.572
Yeah, me, neither.

16:39.574 --> 16:41.073
(groans):
Oh...

16:41.075 --> 16:43.459
(indistinct chatter)

16:46.064 --> 16:47.897
WOMAN (whispers):
She's coming. She's coming.

16:47.899 --> 16:49.173
ALL:
Surprise!

16:49.175 --> 16:51.009
-(laughter)
-Oh, my God.

16:51.011 --> 16:52.993
You guys did not have
to do this.

16:52.995 --> 16:54.403
SUE:
Well, of course we do.

16:54.405 --> 16:56.497
We didn't get a chance
to throw you a shower.

16:56.499 --> 16:58.332
Well, the least we can do is
give you a good welcome back.

16:58.334 --> 17:00.685
LINDA:
Mm-hmm. That one is

17:00.687 --> 17:01.911
-for baby.
-MADDIE: Aw.

17:01.913 --> 17:03.354
This is for Mommy.

17:03.356 --> 17:06.173
-(laughs softly)
-Uh, how does it feel
being back?

17:06.175 --> 17:08.842
Weird. I mean, I haven't left
the house in two months,

17:08.844 --> 17:10.511
except
for doctor's appointments.

17:10.513 --> 17:12.363
Ah, just wait
for the mom guilt to set in.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.515
And everyone's gonna have
advice. Don't take it.

17:14.517 --> 17:16.942
You have to figure out
what works best for yourself.

17:16.944 --> 17:19.278
-Except for this.
-JOSH: Didn't you just say

17:19.280 --> 17:21.021
-that she should...?
-Uh, you can have it all,

17:21.023 --> 17:22.874
but you can't do it all.

17:22.876 --> 17:24.950
Delegate, get help.
Don't be a martyr.

17:24.952 --> 17:26.878
SUE:
She's right. It takes a village.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.789
-So use your village.
-Ah.

17:29.791 --> 17:31.198
It's good to have you back.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.292
It's good to be back.

17:33.294 --> 17:35.961
-Let's go get cake.
-Yes.

17:35.963 --> 17:37.463
You ready for this?

17:37.465 --> 17:39.873
No. Basically ran out
of the house this morning

17:39.875 --> 17:41.375
before I could change my mind

17:41.377 --> 17:43.135
and not leave Jee's side
until she's 40.

17:43.137 --> 17:45.288
-I have no idea
what that feels like, but...
-(laughs)

17:45.290 --> 17:47.398
I do know that I'm here
for you, whatever you need.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.293
Other than babysitting. That
feels like a lot of pressure.

17:50.295 --> 17:53.404
It's okay.
Chimney's got us covered.

17:53.406 --> 17:54.405
â™ª

17:54.407 --> 17:56.908
Albert, did you take
your medicine?

17:56.910 --> 17:58.910
I forgot.

17:58.912 --> 18:00.495
Okay.

18:02.490 --> 18:04.207
Here.

18:07.979 --> 18:10.070
-Can you help?
-(steam hissing)

18:10.072 --> 18:11.997
Uh, yeah, sure.
Just give me a second.

18:11.999 --> 18:13.407
Aah! Damn it!
(inhales sharply)

18:13.409 --> 18:14.926
-Are you okay?
-(knocking)

18:14.928 --> 18:16.469
(Jee-Yun crying)

18:17.931 --> 18:19.746
Definitely not.

18:19.748 --> 18:22.433
(Chimney sighs)

18:22.435 --> 18:24.251
Mrs. Lee.

18:24.253 --> 18:27.563
Anne. That is still weird
for me. Please come in.

18:29.167 --> 18:31.834
-Hi, Anne.
-I come bearing soup.

18:31.836 --> 18:33.427
Aw. What are you doing?

18:33.429 --> 18:35.171
Why didn't you let me know
you were coming?

18:35.173 --> 18:37.782
I would have picked up a little
or lit a match.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.175
Nonsense.

18:39.177 --> 18:41.101
No need to make things perfect
for me.

18:41.103 --> 18:43.195
(gasps softly)

18:43.197 --> 18:47.274
Oh. I think she's hungry.

18:47.276 --> 18:50.144
I was just making her a bottle
and Albert's lunch.

18:50.146 --> 18:52.630
And I might need
to make her another one. Okay.

18:52.632 --> 18:53.798
Here, let me.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.800
I'll feed the baby, you two eat.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.135
CHIMNEY:
Thank you.

18:57.137 --> 19:01.030
So, I know that you didn't

19:01.032 --> 19:02.456
just happen
to be in the neighborhood.

19:02.458 --> 19:04.809
Did Maddie ask you
to come in and check on me?

19:04.811 --> 19:07.052
(laughs)
So suspicious.

19:07.054 --> 19:09.722
You know, Maddie asked me
the same question

19:09.724 --> 19:11.298
when I called her yesterday.

19:11.300 --> 19:13.893
I just wanted to see
if you two needed any help.

19:13.895 --> 19:16.228
That's very sweet of you,
but we're fine.

19:16.230 --> 19:18.489
I think we've all got it
under control.

19:18.491 --> 19:19.323
We do?

19:20.234 --> 19:21.717
Actually, Anne,
do you mind taking me

19:21.719 --> 19:23.828
to my therapy session
so that Howie doesn't have to?

19:23.830 --> 19:25.312
-Happy to.
-Hey.

19:25.314 --> 19:27.390
You remembered your appointment.
That's great.

19:27.392 --> 19:29.458
Uh, no, but I still know
how to read.

19:31.004 --> 19:33.320
You two have busy schedules.

19:33.322 --> 19:35.339
Yeah. I know it looks crazy,

19:35.341 --> 19:38.083
but, uh,
Maddie and I are making it work.

19:38.085 --> 19:39.993
We don't want
to lose a second with Jee-Yun,

19:39.995 --> 19:41.570
and leaving her
with strangers...

19:42.515 --> 19:46.017
Of course, I...
I wouldn't want to overstep.

19:46.019 --> 19:47.501
-(crying)
-Oh. No. No, no, no, I-I...

19:47.503 --> 19:49.169
I didn't mean that.
That's not what I...

19:49.171 --> 19:50.596
-I'm ready.
-Great. Um, we should get going.

19:50.598 --> 19:52.839
-Well, wait, uh... Well, uh...
-See you later, Howie.

19:52.841 --> 19:56.027
-Goodbye, Howard.
-Well, uh, wait.

19:56.029 --> 19:58.845
-(crying)
-Anne?

19:58.847 --> 20:00.531
â™ª

20:06.264 --> 20:08.539
TONI:
Thought I'd find you in here,

20:08.541 --> 20:10.416
torturing yourself.

20:15.273 --> 20:17.957
It's a little hard
to let it go, Ma.

20:17.959 --> 20:21.052
And please don't tell me I knew
what I was signing up for.

20:21.054 --> 20:23.796
I wasn't gonna say anything

20:23.798 --> 20:26.540
'cause I don't have the answer.

20:26.542 --> 20:28.284
I wish I did.

20:28.286 --> 20:32.563
I hate to see you
hurting like this.

20:33.882 --> 20:36.484
(sighs)
I just miss her.

20:38.053 --> 20:42.073
And I loved her
like she was my own.

20:42.075 --> 20:44.224
And a year from now,

20:44.226 --> 20:47.060
she won't even remember
who I am.

20:47.062 --> 20:50.063
I'm not so sure about that.

20:50.065 --> 20:54.310
She might not be able
to recall specific memories,

20:54.312 --> 20:58.831
but she will remember
how you made her feel.

20:58.833 --> 21:00.983
Loved.

21:00.985 --> 21:02.835
Protected.

21:02.837 --> 21:05.154
Safe.

21:05.156 --> 21:07.765
She won't forget that.

21:09.269 --> 21:13.846
She will carry that
with her always.

21:13.848 --> 21:16.999
Because of you.

21:17.001 --> 21:18.851
(sobbing)

21:18.853 --> 21:21.237
Honey, I know.

21:22.673 --> 21:24.690
I know.

21:24.692 --> 21:26.600
Let it out.

21:26.602 --> 21:29.770
<i> ATHENA:</i>
<i> All right, make sure</i>
<i> you have everything you need</i>

21:29.772 --> 21:31.030
<i> before you get in the car</i>

21:31.032 --> 21:33.032
-or your dad will have my head.
-MAY: Uh,

21:33.034 --> 21:34.475
Harry, can you pass me my phone?

21:35.128 --> 21:36.794
I said to<i> pass</i> me the phone,

21:36.796 --> 21:39.946
-not check it.
-HARRY: Laila liked
your post on Instagram.

21:39.948 --> 21:41.540
-Give it.
-HARRY: Wait, isn't she

21:41.542 --> 21:43.208
that mean girl that you went
to high school with?

21:43.210 --> 21:46.028
Why are you talking to her?

21:46.030 --> 21:48.789
She reached out to me
a couple weeks ago.

21:48.791 --> 21:50.199
Out of the blue.

21:50.201 --> 21:52.125
Said she wanted to apologize
for what happened.

21:52.127 --> 21:53.644
Hmm. And you told her,
"Go to hell."

21:53.646 --> 21:57.206
No. Um, I met her for coffee
and heard her out. That's it.

21:57.208 --> 22:00.392
She trashed your reputation
on social media,

22:00.394 --> 22:02.895
said terrible lies about you,
and that's it?

22:02.897 --> 22:06.306
-No big deal?
-I feel like I at least
owed it to her to listen.

22:06.308 --> 22:08.159
You don't owe her a damn thing.

22:08.161 --> 22:10.328
After what she did to you?

22:10.330 --> 22:13.405
You did arrest her.
Or did you forget that part?

22:13.407 --> 22:16.725
I didn't forget a single thing
about that... incident.

22:16.727 --> 22:18.836
I-I can't believe

22:18.838 --> 22:20.671
that you didn't tell me
about this.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.898
Why would you hide it from me?

22:22.900 --> 22:25.676
Hello? This entire conversation.

22:25.678 --> 22:27.053
I never know

22:27.055 --> 22:28.587
how you're gonna react
these days. You're always

22:28.589 --> 22:30.497
worried about me-- you don't
like my job, and apparently,

22:30.499 --> 22:33.926
-now you don't like my friends.
-So now she's your friend?

22:33.928 --> 22:36.354
May! What-what-what
are you doing?

22:36.356 --> 22:39.264
Letting this girl
get back in your head again?

22:39.266 --> 22:41.842
She's changed. I have changed.

22:41.844 --> 22:43.027
So I'm giving her
a second chance.

22:43.029 --> 22:44.770
What's wrong with that?

22:44.772 --> 22:47.198
Because the last time
you were friends with that girl,

22:47.200 --> 22:49.533
you tried to kill yourself!

22:50.945 --> 22:53.329
â™ª

23:03.532 --> 23:05.591
LAFD!

23:07.962 --> 23:09.369
Can I help you?

23:09.371 --> 23:12.056
LAFD, ma'am. We got a call
about an overdose?

23:12.058 --> 23:13.540
You must have the wrong address.

23:13.542 --> 23:17.395
-HEN: This is
4941 North Orchard Drive.
-Yes.

23:17.397 --> 23:20.139
Dispatcher said they got a call
from an Ellen Saxton?

23:20.141 --> 23:22.691
What? Uh, that's my mom.

23:24.553 --> 23:25.694
Mama?

23:26.814 --> 23:28.221
Finally.

23:28.223 --> 23:31.575
Mom, wh-what's wrong?
You called 911?

23:32.578 --> 23:34.060
Are you okay?

23:34.062 --> 23:35.729
(exhales)

23:35.731 --> 23:37.581
I'm dying, Julia.

23:38.734 --> 23:40.066
Cancer.

23:40.068 --> 23:43.145
Also, I may have taken

23:43.147 --> 23:47.833
something to...
speed up the dying process.

23:47.835 --> 23:50.761
Oh, my God, Mama.
Are you crazy?

23:53.174 --> 23:54.990
HEN:
Ma'am, what did you take?

23:54.992 --> 23:57.009
I'm not telling.
And I'm not crazy.

23:57.011 --> 24:01.755
I still have
all of my mental faculties.

24:01.757 --> 24:03.107
But not for long.

24:03.109 --> 24:05.258
Cancer's spreading.

24:05.260 --> 24:07.427
It's in my brain, baby,

24:07.429 --> 24:10.263
and I am not sticking around
for that.

24:10.265 --> 24:12.265
Blood pressure's 80/40.
She's in the danger zone.

24:12.267 --> 24:14.343
HEN:
Looks like an opioid overdose.

24:14.345 --> 24:16.745
-Prepping naloxone.
-That won't be necessary.

24:18.683 --> 24:19.999
Or legal.

24:25.206 --> 24:28.023
It's a do-not-resuscitate order.

24:28.025 --> 24:30.876
With signed verification
from my doctor.

24:30.878 --> 24:34.697
No lifesaving measures,

24:34.699 --> 24:36.122
no medical intervention.

24:36.124 --> 24:38.792
It's all there.

24:38.794 --> 24:41.127
Advanced directives.

24:41.129 --> 24:43.296
Don't listen to her.

24:43.298 --> 24:45.816
D-Do whatever you have to do
to save her!

24:45.818 --> 24:48.969
No. You can't save me.

24:48.971 --> 24:50.821
Just...

24:50.823 --> 24:53.398
delaying the inevitable.

24:53.400 --> 24:56.160
Why the hell did you call 911
if you didn't want help?

24:56.162 --> 24:58.662
I called them for you.

24:58.664 --> 25:00.906
So you wouldn't be alone

25:00.908 --> 25:02.541
when I go.

25:05.487 --> 25:06.411
Mom,

25:06.413 --> 25:09.656
if you don't want me
to be alone,

25:09.658 --> 25:12.568
don't do this.

25:12.570 --> 25:14.069
We don't know

25:14.071 --> 25:16.238
how much time you have left.

25:16.240 --> 25:19.266
It could be months.

25:20.094 --> 25:22.394
I don't care if you're sick.

25:23.247 --> 25:27.266
I want that time with you.

25:27.268 --> 25:30.769
I want all the time I can get.

25:30.771 --> 25:32.530
ELLEN:
This isn't living.

25:32.532 --> 25:34.923
It's suffering.

25:34.925 --> 25:37.426
And I'm not talking about me.

25:37.428 --> 25:41.521
I see what this
is doing to you, and...

25:41.523 --> 25:45.768
(exhales)
I don't want to do it anymore.

25:45.770 --> 25:47.603
HEN:
Legally,

25:47.605 --> 25:49.955
aren't we obligated
to render aid at this point?

25:49.957 --> 25:52.032
We-we can't just stand here
and let her...

25:52.034 --> 25:53.217
The DNR is clear.

25:53.219 --> 25:55.110
Legally,
we shouldn't do anything.

25:55.112 --> 25:57.112
I-I'm sorry, our hands are tied.

25:57.114 --> 25:59.890
Fine. You can't do it.

25:59.892 --> 26:01.633
-I will.
-No. No, no.

26:01.635 --> 26:02.968
(shushing)

26:02.970 --> 26:07.213
You gave up your entire life

26:07.215 --> 26:09.900
to take care of me.

26:09.902 --> 26:13.070
Well, now it's time

26:13.072 --> 26:17.700
for me to give it back.

26:19.579 --> 26:24.156
-I can't.
-Shh.

26:24.158 --> 26:26.992
I'm not leaving you.

26:26.994 --> 26:30.829
I am setting you free.

26:30.831 --> 26:32.238
(chuckles softly)

26:32.240 --> 26:33.907
When you have your own kids,

26:33.909 --> 26:35.984
you'll understand.

26:35.986 --> 26:39.171
Mama, please. I love you.

26:39.173 --> 26:42.324
ELLEN:
Oh, I love you, too.

26:42.326 --> 26:44.843
("Landslide"
by Fleetwood Mac plays)

26:44.845 --> 26:48.180
This is the last thing

26:48.182 --> 26:51.166
I can do for you, baby.

26:51.168 --> 26:53.518
So let me.

26:53.520 --> 26:55.095
â™ª

26:55.097 --> 26:56.930
-No.
-â™ª<i> I took my love</i> â™ª

26:56.932 --> 26:58.340
â™ª<i> I took it down...</i> â™ª

26:58.342 --> 27:01.101
-Did you check under the bed?
-ELLEN: I did.

27:01.103 --> 27:02.861
All clear. No monsters.

27:02.863 --> 27:04.196
Good night, sweetheart.

27:04.198 --> 27:07.032
-(kisses)
-Can you stay?

27:07.034 --> 27:09.627
I'm scared to sleep by myself.

27:09.629 --> 27:11.128
I thought we agreed.

27:11.130 --> 27:14.114
Big girls sleep by themselves
in their own big-girl bed.

27:14.116 --> 27:15.949
I'll be a big girl tomorrow.

27:15.951 --> 27:18.284
Can't you just stay
with me tonight?

27:18.286 --> 27:20.028
â™ª<i> Oh, mirror in the sky</i> â™ª

27:20.030 --> 27:22.640
-Scoot over.
-â™ª<i> What is love?</i> â™ª

27:22.642 --> 27:24.124
All right.

27:24.126 --> 27:26.051
-Just for tonight.
-â™ª<i> Can the child</i> â™ª

27:26.053 --> 27:29.221
â™ª<i> Within my heart rise above?</i> â™ª

27:29.223 --> 27:31.297
(whispers):
Sweet dreams, sweetheart.

27:31.299 --> 27:32.983
â™ª<i> Can I sail</i>
<i> through the changing...</i> â™ª

27:32.985 --> 27:35.043
Uh, how much water
am I supposed to use again?

27:35.045 --> 27:36.879
Check the recipe.

27:36.881 --> 27:39.139
Or you could just tell me.

27:39.141 --> 27:41.917
If I do it for you,
you'll never learn.

27:41.919 --> 27:43.994
-â™ª<i> Life...</i> â™ª
-(sighs)

27:43.996 --> 27:45.663
Okay.

27:45.665 --> 27:48.481
-It's my life.
You don't get to ruin it.
-ELLEN: Of course I do.

27:48.483 --> 27:50.668
I'm your mother,
and what I say goes.

27:50.670 --> 27:52.561
-I hate you!
-The answer...

27:52.563 --> 27:53.729
(exhales)

27:53.731 --> 27:55.822
(chuckles)
Oh.

27:55.824 --> 27:58.050
Mama, I got this.

27:58.052 --> 27:59.343
You should be resting.

27:59.345 --> 28:01.995
No, no, you don't have
to do this, you know.

28:01.997 --> 28:03.997
I can hire a full-time nurse.

28:03.999 --> 28:06.124
-My insurance will pay for it.
-No one

28:06.126 --> 28:08.927
is going to take care of you
the way that I will.

28:08.929 --> 28:10.595
-â™ª<i> If you see my reflection</i> â™ª
-Hmm?

28:10.597 --> 28:12.690
-â™ª<i> In the snow-covered hills</i> â™ª
-No nurses.

28:12.692 --> 28:15.267
I want to do this.

28:15.269 --> 28:16.193
â™ª<i> The landslide bring it down</i> â™ª

28:16.195 --> 28:19.530
You'd do the same thing for me.

28:19.532 --> 28:24.017
â™ª<i> And if you see my reflection</i>
<i> in the snow-covered hills...</i> â™ª

28:24.019 --> 28:26.328
(Ellen exhales)

28:28.098 --> 28:29.948
HEN:
Julia,

28:29.950 --> 28:33.168
I think she stopped breathing.

28:36.865 --> 28:39.174
Is it okay if I check?

28:42.963 --> 28:44.947
(bag unzips)

28:44.949 --> 28:46.390
(Julia sniffles)

28:53.048 --> 28:55.983
Chim, can you confirm?

29:05.319 --> 29:08.662
I'm gonna go call it in.
I'll be outside.

29:14.995 --> 29:17.980
What do I do now?

29:17.982 --> 29:20.966
HEN:
Take her with you.

29:23.821 --> 29:25.971
And you move on.

29:35.090 --> 29:37.399
(birds chirping)

29:43.932 --> 29:46.174
-Oh, God! (gasps)
<i> -HARRY: Mom!</i>

29:46.176 --> 29:47.692
-What's wrong with May?
-Baby, I need you to call

29:47.694 --> 29:49.361
<i> your father, tell him</i>
<i> to meet me at the hospital.</i>

29:49.363 --> 29:51.121
Pulse is weak and thready.
What did she take?

29:51.123 --> 29:52.956
<i> -Uh, hydrocodone.</i>
<i> -Pupils aren't responding.</i>

29:52.958 --> 29:54.032
<i> MAY:</i>
<i> Hi. This is May.</i>

29:54.034 --> 29:55.200
I'm right here. Can you hear me?

29:55.202 --> 29:56.701
<i> -(siren wailing)</i>
<i> -It's okay.</i>

29:56.703 --> 29:58.278
-(sighs)
<i> -MAY: Hi.</i>

29:58.280 --> 30:00.631
<i> This is May. Leave a message.</i>

30:02.192 --> 30:05.118
-Hey.
-ATHENA: Hey.

30:06.030 --> 30:09.031
-You, uh, talk to May yet?
-Mm, keep trying,

30:09.033 --> 30:11.308
but she's not answering
my calls.

30:11.310 --> 30:13.143
Sending me
straight to voice mail.

30:13.145 --> 30:15.704
Sounds like things
got pretty heated.

30:15.706 --> 30:18.206
That girl hurt my child.

30:18.208 --> 30:19.817
All bets are off.

30:19.819 --> 30:21.819
She lucky all I did
was arrest her.

30:21.821 --> 30:23.320
(sighs)

30:23.322 --> 30:25.564
Sorry if I can't just forgive
and forget.

30:25.566 --> 30:28.383
Well, they were kids.
She barely knew better.

30:28.385 --> 30:29.993
Oh, she knew what she was doing.

30:29.995 --> 30:31.495
I don't get it.

30:31.497 --> 30:34.573
Why would May want to have
anything to do with her

30:34.575 --> 30:37.483
-after what she put her through?
-I don't know.

30:37.485 --> 30:39.670
But I do know
that you sometimes don't agree

30:39.672 --> 30:41.563
with May's decisions.

30:41.565 --> 30:43.565
You didn't want her to take
the job at the call center.

30:43.567 --> 30:45.676
-You wanted her
to go to college.
-I didn't want her

30:45.678 --> 30:48.953
to take that job
because it's emotionally taxing.

30:48.955 --> 30:51.664
Right. She has been keeping up

30:51.666 --> 30:54.092
with her counselor sessions.
Seems like she's handling it.

30:54.094 --> 30:56.019
And she's
practically an adult now.

30:56.021 --> 30:58.080
You don't have to like
her choices,

30:58.082 --> 31:01.007
but they are her choices.

31:01.009 --> 31:02.751
And if she says she's fine

31:02.753 --> 31:05.362
talking with Laila, maybe you
just have to trust that she is.

31:05.364 --> 31:07.923
That's the mistake I made
last time.

31:07.925 --> 31:10.016
I trusted that she was fine,

31:10.018 --> 31:11.443
and I almost lost her.

31:11.445 --> 31:13.111
She was right here
living under my roof,

31:13.113 --> 31:14.854
and I didn't know
what was going on.

31:14.856 --> 31:17.432
I was so wrapped up with me
and Michael and the divorce

31:17.434 --> 31:19.376
that I didn't even realize
what was going on

31:19.378 --> 31:21.286
-with my own daughter.
-Well, she was

31:21.288 --> 31:23.213
a teenager at the time.
It's their whole M.O. in life

31:23.215 --> 31:25.273
not to let their parents know
what's going on.

31:25.275 --> 31:26.775
When it happened, I assumed

31:26.777 --> 31:28.534
it was because of me
and Michael splitting up,

31:28.536 --> 31:31.963
but it was about something
I had absolutely no clue about.

31:31.965 --> 31:33.373
-None.
-Right.

31:33.375 --> 31:35.541
So you-you have to forgive
yourself, Athena.

31:35.543 --> 31:38.787
Do you know how many suicide
calls I've been on where nobody

31:38.789 --> 31:41.899
had any idea? You can't
take on that kind of blame.

31:41.901 --> 31:43.233
I'm her mother.

31:43.235 --> 31:45.977
I should have known
something was wrong.

31:45.979 --> 31:48.054
But I missed it.

31:48.056 --> 31:50.890
I'm scared
she hates me right now.

31:50.892 --> 31:52.984
But I'm more scared

31:52.986 --> 31:55.913
that I'm gonna miss it again.

31:55.915 --> 31:58.165
(exhales)

32:00.827 --> 32:02.127
Morning.

32:02.980 --> 32:04.996
I think I did a bad thing.

32:04.998 --> 32:06.906
U-Ultimately good

32:06.908 --> 32:08.833
but still bad.

32:08.835 --> 32:10.743
What are you talking about?

32:10.745 --> 32:14.264
I found Nia's birth mother.

32:17.177 --> 32:20.086
Her name is Evangeline Gonzalez.

32:20.088 --> 32:22.773
She works here
as a nurse's aide.

32:22.775 --> 32:25.183
Karen, how did you find her?

32:25.185 --> 32:28.261
And isn't that
completely against the rules?

32:28.263 --> 32:31.097
Uh, I may have hired
a private investigator.

32:31.099 --> 32:33.175
Look, I had to know.

32:33.177 --> 32:35.010
The not knowing was killing me.

32:35.012 --> 32:36.011
Killing you.

32:36.013 --> 32:37.270
I had to know

32:37.272 --> 32:39.790
if Nia was gonna be okay.

32:39.792 --> 32:41.458
And is she?

32:41.460 --> 32:42.793
Single mom.

32:42.795 --> 32:45.445
Struggling to make ends meet.

32:45.447 --> 32:46.371
She got evicted.

32:46.373 --> 32:48.707
She was living in her car
with Nia.

32:48.709 --> 32:51.026
People saw her,
and they called child services,

32:51.028 --> 32:53.361
who placed her with us,
temporarily,

32:53.363 --> 32:55.430
while she got her life
back together.

32:56.791 --> 32:58.158
-That was January.
-(exhales)

32:58.160 --> 32:59.977
And then the pandemic hit.

32:59.979 --> 33:04.022
Not an easy time to be trying
to put your life back together.

33:04.024 --> 33:05.631
She couldn't catch a break.

33:05.633 --> 33:10.228
Unless you were willing to work
at a long-term care facility.

33:10.230 --> 33:12.823
-Mm.
-She's been here since June.

33:12.825 --> 33:14.232
The residents love her.

33:14.234 --> 33:16.718
And there's a day care
down the street.

33:16.720 --> 33:19.571
She goes over on her lunch hour
to eat with Nia.

33:19.573 --> 33:21.581
Every day.

33:22.576 --> 33:23.575
(sighs)

33:23.577 --> 33:24.909
Nia's gonna be okay.

33:24.911 --> 33:26.152
Yeah.

33:26.154 --> 33:28.588
We did the right thing, Hen.

33:29.916 --> 33:32.259
You want to do this again.

33:34.013 --> 33:36.071
I love Nia.

33:36.073 --> 33:38.498
I will always miss
having her in our lives.

33:38.500 --> 33:41.576
But knowing that she's
with a mother who loves her,

33:41.578 --> 33:44.837
that we helped
to give them a second chance,

33:44.839 --> 33:47.190
I'm proud of us for that.

33:47.192 --> 33:48.508
(inhales)

33:48.510 --> 33:51.194
It's gonna hurt like hell
every time we do this.

33:51.196 --> 33:55.014
-Yeah.
-We're gonna love them
like our own

33:55.016 --> 33:56.992
and then have to let them go.

34:00.039 --> 34:02.497
But I guess we can take it.

34:08.714 --> 34:10.121
(scoffs)
I'm just tired

34:10.123 --> 34:12.215
-of always fighting with her.
-Mm-hmm.

34:12.217 --> 34:14.534
She doesn't think I'm capable
of handling anything.

34:14.536 --> 34:18.280
Yeah. But she knows you have
a good head on your shoulders.

34:18.282 --> 34:20.949
Hmm?
She's just being protective.

34:20.951 --> 34:22.542
And I can't say
that I blame her.

34:22.544 --> 34:24.119
But you didn't act
like a lunatic

34:24.121 --> 34:25.787
when I told you
Laila reached out.

34:25.789 --> 34:27.122
Right.

34:27.124 --> 34:29.066
And I wasn't the one
that found you either.

34:29.960 --> 34:31.693
What difference does that make?

34:32.979 --> 34:35.980
You know,
when Harry called me that day,

34:35.982 --> 34:37.632
he said that you were sick,

34:37.634 --> 34:41.060
that you and your mom were going
to the hospital.

34:41.062 --> 34:43.154
By the time I got there,

34:43.156 --> 34:46.232
found out what really happened,

34:46.234 --> 34:49.735
it was all so... (exhales)
just confusing and scary.

34:49.737 --> 34:52.297
But you were alive.

34:52.925 --> 34:54.316
Exactly.

34:54.318 --> 34:55.984
You weren't
when your mother found you.

34:55.986 --> 34:58.011
You weren't breathing, May.

34:59.172 --> 35:01.765
She thought you were dead.

35:01.767 --> 35:03.916
And she blamed herself for it.

35:03.918 --> 35:05.827
Why would she think that?

35:05.829 --> 35:07.345
They were her pills, May.

35:07.347 --> 35:10.348
Pills that I told her
to throw out.

35:10.350 --> 35:12.851
-Wait, you blamed her, too?
-No.

35:12.853 --> 35:15.946
We both said a lot of things.

35:15.948 --> 35:18.006
Because we were scared.

35:18.008 --> 35:20.358
And then we got past it.

35:20.360 --> 35:22.953
We realized what was
the most important thing,

35:22.955 --> 35:26.364
and that was just being there
for you.

35:26.366 --> 35:30.127
Yeah, not all this guilt
and blame.

35:30.129 --> 35:32.778
It was pointless.

35:32.780 --> 35:34.189
I know you think

35:34.191 --> 35:37.968
that your mom is made of steel.

35:39.621 --> 35:41.621
She's not.

35:41.623 --> 35:43.381
And I'll never know

35:43.383 --> 35:46.217
what she went through
when she found you.

35:46.219 --> 35:48.052
And I'm kind of grateful

35:48.054 --> 35:50.605
that I never will.

38:14.184 --> 38:16.351
You fell asleep while standing.

(sighs)
I know. I'm sorry.

38:19.689 --> 38:21.189
I'm just so tired.

38:21.191 --> 38:24.025
Yesterday I fell asleep
while holding the baby.

38:24.027 --> 38:25.193
On the toilet.

38:25.195 --> 38:27.220
(both laughing)

38:28.365 --> 38:30.048
How do other people do this?

38:30.050 --> 38:31.308
I don't know.

38:31.310 --> 38:33.626
But I think we might need help.

38:33.628 --> 38:34.960
Yeah.

38:34.962 --> 38:36.730
And I think I know who to call.

38:38.966 --> 38:40.483
I know it's a lot to ask.
(exhales)

38:40.485 --> 38:43.135
Albert can stay with us
as long as he likes.

38:43.137 --> 38:44.821
Give you two your space.

38:44.823 --> 38:46.230
And, honestly,

38:46.232 --> 38:49.159
I think John's kind of excited
about having him around.

38:49.161 --> 38:50.493
(chuckles):
Well,

38:50.495 --> 38:53.312
life can be pretty boring
when you're both retired.

38:53.314 --> 38:54.980
-(laughs)
-(Jee-Yun fussing)

38:54.982 --> 38:57.909
And we're available
for babysitting services

38:57.911 --> 39:00.837
any time you and Maddie
need a night off.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.154
Oh. Albert's medications.

39:02.156 --> 39:03.231
I should grab them, too.

39:03.233 --> 39:05.249
-I'll take her.
-Okay.

39:05.251 --> 39:09.253
Grandma's gonna hold you
while Daddy goes to pack.

39:09.255 --> 39:12.924
Howard, uh, I'm not...

39:12.926 --> 39:14.242
-um...
-(chuckles softly)

39:14.244 --> 39:16.094
I mean, your mother...

39:16.096 --> 39:18.262
Would be so grateful to you.

39:18.264 --> 39:20.932
That you took in her kid
after she was gone,

39:20.934 --> 39:22.692
loved him.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.027
Loved me.
(chuckles)

39:24.029 --> 39:26.588
You finished the job
she started, and...

39:26.590 --> 39:29.616
I'm not sure
I ever said thank you for that.

39:30.610 --> 39:31.926
We're family.

39:31.928 --> 39:33.761
Nothing to thank me for.

39:33.763 --> 39:35.688
(chuckles)

39:35.690 --> 39:37.281
Okay.

39:37.283 --> 39:38.933
("Solsbury Hill"

39:38.935 --> 39:40.710
Oh, don't worry, Jee-Yun.

39:40.712 --> 39:43.213
Grandma's got you.

39:43.215 --> 39:45.106
I know it's been really hard,
so...

39:45.108 --> 39:47.384
if you're not ready,
that's okay.

39:47.386 --> 39:50.278
We don't want to make a big
decision without talking to you.

39:50.280 --> 39:52.797
It affects all of us, so...

39:52.799 --> 39:54.224
we should decide together.

39:54.226 --> 39:56.226
What do you want to do, Denny?

I want to...

Oh. What's all this?

40:03.551 --> 40:05.585
â™ª<i> Climbing up</i>

40:05.587 --> 40:06.903
Are you okay?

40:06.905 --> 40:08.220
I'm sorry, Mom.

40:08.222 --> 40:10.632
I'm so sorry
I put you through that.

40:10.634 --> 40:11.891
I'm sorry, too.

40:11.893 --> 40:14.059
I love you, May.

So much.

(exhales)

40:27.834 --> 40:29.333
Oh, what is this?

40:29.335 --> 40:31.076
I thought we'd do dinner
and a movie.

40:31.078 --> 40:33.838
(gasps)
It's like a date night.

40:33.840 --> 40:34.931
Exactly.

40:34.933 --> 40:36.766
So, what do you want to watch?

40:36.768 --> 40:38.417
Ooh, um...

40:38.419 --> 40:41.663
<i> HEN:</i>
<i> It's not until you have kids</i>

40:47.612 --> 40:50.354
â™ª<i> Home...</i> â™ª

I can't sleep.
Can I watch TV with you guys?

40:56.938 --> 40:59.030
Of course.
Squeeze in here.

40:59.032 --> 41:00.515
â™ª<i> Day to day...</i> â™ª

41:00.517 --> 41:02.959
Okay. That means
you got to pick something good

-for us to watch.

No, Linda needs

Family stuff.

41:26.968 --> 41:28.726
Maddie's, what,
our fifth baby this year?

41:28.728 --> 41:31.303
And Alvin's wife is due
next month. And I'm pretty sure

41:31.305 --> 41:33.047
that's what Jenny wants
to talk to us about tomorrow.

41:33.049 --> 41:35.066
Well, we'll figure it out.

-We always do.

Oh.

Sorry. None of my business.

41:40.740 --> 41:42.147
I have kids.

41:42.149 --> 41:43.725
I have a floor full of 'em.
