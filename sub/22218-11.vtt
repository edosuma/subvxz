09:04.377 --> 09:06.254
{\an3}- Doing a full set of nails,
as it grows out,

09:06.337 --> 09:08.130
<i>she'll steadily have</i>
<i>a style on there</i>

09:08.214 --> 09:09.298
<i>for a longer amount of time</i>

09:09.382 --> 09:10.466
<i>than just having</i>
<i>a little sticker.</i>

09:10.549 --> 09:12.510
{\an3}Overall, I think
the consistency is strong.

09:13.010 --> 09:14.929
<i>- Erik.</i>

09:15.012 --> 09:16.722
{\an3}- They look very crisp
and very sharp.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.140
{\an3}<i>It's a perfect size ratio</i>
<i>for the nail</i>

09:18.224 --> 09:20.142
{\an3}<i>that follows consistency</i>
<i>very well.</i>

09:20.226 --> 09:22.353
{\an3}<i>The only inconsistency</i>
<i>I see is,</i>

09:22.436 --> 09:23.896
<i>a couple of stars have</i>
<i>a little bit different</i>

09:23.980 --> 09:26.107
{\an3}<i>tone and shade of purple</i>
<i>than the others.</i>

09:26.190 --> 09:27.483
- Duffy.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.443
{\an3}- Out of all the different
looks that you have,

09:29.527 --> 09:30.319
<i>the ones with almost</i>
<i>the half-moon circles</i>

09:30.403 --> 09:32.530
<i>are really</i>
<i>the most interesting,</i>

09:32.613 --> 09:33.197
<i>and the ones that align</i>
<i>the same way</i>

09:33.281 --> 09:35.491
<i>are very consistent.</i>

09:35.574 --> 09:38.119
The application and technique
is all very strong.

09:38.202 --> 09:39.328
<i>- Kruseman.</i>

09:39.412 --> 09:41.872
<i>- As far as the floral design,</i>

09:41.956 --> 09:42.832
<i>I think it fits</i>
<i>the nail very nice.</i>

09:42.915 --> 09:44.834
<i>Kind of tricky</i>
<i>with the spider web.</i>

09:44.917 --> 09:46.544
<i>That's where you kind of</i>
<i>lost the consistency.</i>

09:46.627 --> 09:49.088
<i>You see a lot more changes and</i>
<i>wavering details</i>

09:49.171 --> 09:51.173
in the spider webs.

09:51.257 --> 09:52.216
<i>- Matt.</i>

09:52.300 --> 09:54.010
<i>- The anchors came out very</i>
<i>consistent.</i>

09:54.093 --> 09:56.178
<i>The ship wheels was a tough</i>
<i>thing to deal yourself.</i>

09:56.262 --> 09:57.346
- And that's where your
inconsistency show a little bit.

09:57.430 --> 09:58.681
<i>That's a tough spot to be in,</i>

09:58.764 --> 10:02.351
<i>to have to do that many circles</i>
<i>on fingernails.</i>

10:02.435 --> 10:04.228
<i>- Katie.</i>
<i>- These came out really cute.</i>

10:04.312 --> 10:05.855
<i>The moon and star,</i>
<i>every other finger</i>

10:05.938 --> 10:07.189
is a really nice idea.

10:07.273 --> 10:09.567
<i>So the line consistency</i>
<i>and the color consistency,</i>

10:09.650 --> 10:10.526
<i>I think it's nice,</i>

10:10.609 --> 10:12.653
<i>but as far as consistency goes,</i>

10:12.737 --> 10:15.364
<i>the shapes of the moons</i>
<i>do vary.</i>

10:15.448 --> 10:16.949
- Craig.

10:17.033 --> 10:18.868
<i>None of these are the same.</i>
<i>What's going on there?</i>

10:18.951 --> 10:22.538
<i>- I thought it would be cool</i>
<i>to do a night beach scene</i>

10:22.621 --> 10:23.706
that transforms
into a day scene.

10:23.789 --> 10:27.209
<i>- As far as the whole concept</i>
<i>of consistency,</i>

10:27.293 --> 10:28.753
<i>each design is</i>
<i>a little bit different.</i>

10:28.836 --> 10:31.839
<i>They alternate finger to</i>
<i>finger, and that's a fail.</i>

10:31.922 --> 10:33.924
<i>- I'm super pissed--I'm not</i>
<i>breaking any rules here.</i>

10:34.008 --> 10:37.636
{\an8}There is something consistent
throughout the whole design.

10:37.720 --> 10:38.471
<i>It's bull[bleep].</i>

10:38.554 --> 10:41.098
- Today, we're testing
consistency

10:41.182 --> 10:42.641
with micro tattoos
on fingernails.

10:42.725 --> 10:45.561
If you had to pick a bottom,
who would that be?

10:45.644 --> 10:47.521
<i>- Craig definitely</i>
<i>did the most artistic,</i>

10:47.605 --> 10:50.399
creative concept
for across all 10 nails,

10:50.483 --> 10:52.610
<i>but as soon as you look at 'em,</i>
<i>you're struggling to find</i>

10:52.693 --> 10:53.736
<i>which two are the same.</i>

10:53.819 --> 10:55.529
Thinking out of the box
is one thing,

10:55.613 --> 10:56.572
{\an1}but thinking outside of
the challenge is another.

10:56.655 --> 10:59.200
-<i> I think Tyler</i>
<i>really excelled.</i>

10:59.283 --> 11:00.743
-<i> Every one of those</i>
<i>little ice cream cones</i>

11:00.826 --> 11:02.328
<i>has the exact same highlight.</i>

11:02.411 --> 11:03.579
<i>The cone shape, and the actual</i>
<i>placement on each nail</i>

11:03.662 --> 11:06.874
is some of the most perfect ones
that I saw today.

11:06.957 --> 11:09.210
-<i> I think that Duffy did some</i>
<i>nice consistent lines.</i>

11:09.293 --> 11:10.628
<i>- Other people did</i>
<i>color and fades,</i>

11:10.711 --> 11:11.837
<i>it gave it more to judge.</i>

11:11.921 --> 11:14.131
Duffy's is simple
and the lines are clean.

11:14.215 --> 11:14.715
- I think we're all agreed.

11:14.799 --> 11:15.257
- Yeah.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

11:15.341 --> 11:17.968
Let's let them know.

11:18.052 --> 11:20.429
Today, you had to tattoo
matching designs

11:20.513 --> 11:22.932
onto your canvases' fingernails.

11:23.015 --> 11:24.350
<i>The judges have decided,</i>

11:24.433 --> 11:27.561
the winner of today's Flash
Challenge is...

11:27.645 --> 11:29.939
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

11:30.022 --> 11:32.108
Tyler.

11:33.818 --> 11:35.277
- Tyler, overall consistency,

11:35.361 --> 11:37.530
<i>yours were super sharp,</i>
<i>super clean.</i>

11:37.613 --> 11:40.241
<i>The color of each one looked</i>
<i>almost exactly the same.</i>

11:40.324 --> 11:42.118
It came out on top.

11:42.201 --> 11:43.119
{\an8}- I've definitely been waiting
for this moment.

11:43.202 --> 11:45.704
<i>Everybody's [bleep]</i>
<i>underestimating me.</i>

11:45.788 --> 11:48.082
I'm gonna rattle all of their
[bleep] cages tomorrow.

11:48.165 --> 11:50.876
- You'll have the power to
assign all human canvases

11:50.960 --> 11:52.294
<i>for the Elimination Tattoo.</i>

11:52.378 --> 11:53.129
<i>- Way to go, Tyler, man.</i>

11:53.212 --> 11:54.547
{\an8}You knocked this one
out of the park

11:54.630 --> 11:55.506
{\an8}and you got the win,

11:55.589 --> 11:57.133
<i>which means I got the win.</i>

11:57.216 --> 11:58.300
- Head back to the loft

11:58.384 --> 12:01.887
and prepare for
the next Elimination Tattoo.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.973
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

12:04.056 --> 12:06.809
- Chris and I have a plan.
- He'll say all kinds of [bleep]

12:06.892 --> 12:08.811
around everybody else and then
not say it to your face.

12:08.894 --> 12:11.439
<i>- Chris saying</i>
<i>I'm [bleep] disposable.</i>

12:11.522 --> 12:12.481
[bleep] you, dude.

12:12.565 --> 12:13.691
<i>- I'm so pissed off.</i>

12:13.774 --> 12:15.151
If I don't finish,
Matt's got me.

12:15.234 --> 12:16.277
And I can't have that.

12:21.365 --> 12:24.076
- I mean, honestly?

12:24.160 --> 12:25.786
You pretty much put out
on the line

12:25.870 --> 12:26.996
that if you get
the skull pick,

12:27.079 --> 12:29.498
you're gonna come after either
me or Chris.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.042
You know, I have to retaliate
with that.

12:32.126 --> 12:33.335
<i>- What I'm curious about</i>

12:33.419 --> 12:36.338
is why are you so worried
about protecting Chris?

12:36.422 --> 12:38.215
- We're a team, you know.
He's my boy.

12:38.299 --> 12:40.176
- He could let you go at any
point in this competition,

12:40.259 --> 12:42.303
{\an3}which is exactly what
Chris did to Dave Clarke.

12:42.386 --> 12:44.889
- I don't know about that.

12:44.972 --> 12:45.598
<i>Like, before</i>
<i>we even came here,</i>

12:45.681 --> 12:47.433
like, Chris and I have a plan.

12:47.516 --> 12:51.103
{\an3}- But do you think
he really has your back?

12:51.187 --> 12:53.189
{\an1}- Chris is very
strategic, you know.

12:53.272 --> 12:55.900
- And he's also very shady.

12:55.983 --> 12:58.402
{\an3}He's the most
two-faced person in here.

12:58.486 --> 12:59.904
{\an1}- I mean, I know how Chris
rolls 'cause he's been

12:59.987 --> 13:01.280
{\an1}one of my best friends
for 10 years.

13:01.363 --> 13:02.531
- He'll say all
kinds of [bleep]

13:02.615 --> 13:03.866
around everybody else,

13:03.949 --> 13:05.326
and then not say
it to your face.

13:05.409 --> 13:06.452
{\an1}- I don't give a [bleep]
what he says about me.

13:06.535 --> 13:08.370
I don't care if he's gonna
try to stab me in the back.

13:08.454 --> 13:11.665
I'm still gonna
look after him

13:11.749 --> 13:15.044
{\an1}'cause I am a tattooer I am
today because of Chris.

<i>Tyler's not stupid.</i>

16:58.058 --> 17:00.352
<i>I hope he decides he's gonna</i>
<i>grow a pair</i>

17:00.436 --> 17:01.562
{\an8}and not look out for Chris.

17:01.645 --> 17:03.439
- That's for you.

17:03.522 --> 17:05.441
<i>And that's for you.</i>

17:05.523 --> 17:08.527
Here you guys go.

17:08.609 --> 17:10.154
<i>- Canvases, one by one,</i>

17:10.237 --> 17:13.406
<i>please read the artist's name</i>
<i>on the bottom of your skull.</i>

17:13.490 --> 17:14.199
- Chris.

17:26.252 --> 17:28.338
{\an8}- Matt.

17:28.422 --> 17:29.757
{\an8}<i>- Matt pretty much told me</i>

17:29.840 --> 17:31.633
{\an8}<i>that Chris is saying</i>
<i>I'm [ bleep] disposable.</i>

17:31.717 --> 17:32.384
{\an8}[bleep] you, dude.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.261
<i>I'm putting Chris against Matt</i>

17:34.344 --> 17:36.555
'cause I know Chris will beat
him out all day.

17:36.638 --> 17:38.098
{\an8}- Duffy.

17:44.938 --> 17:45.981
- Katie.

17:46.064 --> 17:47.483
-<i> Tyler gives me and Duffy</i>

17:47.566 --> 17:50.569
{\an8}the most difficult painting
to translate into a tattoo.

17:50.652 --> 17:53.822
He's definitely out
to send the girls home.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.282
- Kruseman.

17:55.365 --> 17:57.993
- Erik.

17:58.076 --> 17:59.745
- Tyler.

17:59.828 --> 18:01.163
- Craig.

18:01.246 --> 18:03.582
<i>- I'm glad that Tyler's</i>
<i>going against Craig.</i>

18:03.665 --> 18:04.166
<i>I'm going against Matt.</i>

18:04.249 --> 18:04.833
{\an8}Let's just go at them,

18:04.917 --> 18:06.168
our team against their team.

18:06.251 --> 18:09.630
- Remember guys, after
the Elimination Tattoo,

18:09.713 --> 18:11.673
the human canvas jury will vote

18:11.757 --> 18:14.301
<i>on the tattoo that</i>
<i>they think is the worst,</i>

18:14.384 --> 18:16.804
and put one artist up
for elimination.

18:16.887 --> 18:21.141
<i>You'll have six hours to tattoo</i>
<i>a famous work of art.</i>

18:21.225 --> 18:25.354
Based on your work,
one of you will close shop.

18:25.437 --> 18:26.939
Good luck.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.066
- I'm Kruseman.
- Hi.

18:29.149 --> 18:30.859
- Come on, let's go talk.
<i>- Having to replicate</i>

18:30.943 --> 18:32.569
{\an8}any particular piece of art

18:32.653 --> 18:33.862
<i>always shows consistency</i>

18:33.946 --> 18:35.531
<i>because you have</i>
<i>the actual product,</i>

18:35.614 --> 18:36.907
<i>and you have your replication.</i>

18:36.990 --> 18:38.742
There's no room for
self-interpretation.

18:38.826 --> 18:40.202
- Good thing for you and me

18:40.285 --> 18:43.330
{\an1}is we have done this tattoo
about 30 times.

18:43.413 --> 18:44.414
- Yeah.

18:44.498 --> 18:45.916
{\an1}- I've been in the very top
of this competition

18:45.999 --> 18:47.000
{\an1}the whole time,
so we gotta kill it.

18:47.084 --> 18:49.920
{\an8}This is gonna be
a really big battle.

18:50.003 --> 18:51.672
<i>Tyler puts me head to head</i>
<i>with Chris</i>

18:51.755 --> 18:52.506
because he thinks
he's gonna be able

18:52.589 --> 18:54.550
to take me out
of this competition.

18:54.633 --> 18:55.843
<i>[bleep] you, Tyler.</i>

18:55.926 --> 18:57.219
We're dealing with
a very pale figure,

18:57.302 --> 18:59.304
and that's something
that we'll be contending with

18:59.388 --> 19:00.764
just with your skin tone.
- Yeah.

19:00.848 --> 19:02.099
{\an1}- No big deal--definitely
don't stress about that part.

19:02.182 --> 19:03.392
- All right.

19:03.475 --> 19:04.476
<i>If they think that</i>
<i>they're gonna get me</i>

19:04.560 --> 19:05.769
<i>out of this competition,</i>

19:05.853 --> 19:07.604
they've definitely
got a big surprise coming.

19:07.688 --> 19:09.147
{\an1}- If it it's going
in between your shoulders,

19:09.231 --> 19:11.149
then maybe, like, ovally shaped.

19:11.233 --> 19:13.193
I'm definitely thinking just,
like, a portion of it.

19:13.277 --> 19:14.862
{\an3}- You said that you sat
for 30 minutes,

19:14.945 --> 19:15.904
{\an3}you want it on your ribs,
not good.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.948
{\an1}- I know, It's the most
sensitive area.

19:18.031 --> 19:20.075
{\an3}- It just hurts.
It hurts like a bitch.

19:20.158 --> 19:23.328
{\an8}Tyler is gunning for me
in order to get to Matt.

19:23.412 --> 19:24.538
I'll go ahead and
say off the top,

19:24.621 --> 19:26.164
if we were to put it somewhere

19:26.248 --> 19:28.041
{\an3}like the side of your thigh
or something like that?

19:28.125 --> 19:29.334
- I can't have it on my limbs.

19:29.418 --> 19:30.586
-<i> Okay, you can't have--</i>

19:30.669 --> 19:32.087
<i>what about your shoulders?</i>

19:32.170 --> 19:33.172
- No, not shoulders.

19:33.255 --> 19:34.381
<i>- I could be sent home</i>
<i>for this.</i>

19:34.464 --> 19:37.092
{\an3}If we're gonna do your side,
let's just [bleep] do it.

19:37.175 --> 19:38.677
I'm [bleep].

19:41.096 --> 19:45.434
<i>[rock music]</i>

19:45.517 --> 19:48.729
- So Matt told me, like,
I was disposable to you

19:48.812 --> 19:50.939
{\an1}and that you didn't have any
problems kicking me out of here.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.274
<i>- If for some [bleep] up reason</i>

19:52.357 --> 19:55.444
I was gonna dispose of you
or use things against you

19:55.527 --> 19:59.114
in some weird way, clearly,
none of that has occurred.

19:59.197 --> 20:00.574
{\an1}- Like, we've been
[bleep] each other up

20:00.657 --> 20:01.909
the whole time I've been here.
- The whole time.

20:01.992 --> 20:04.244
{\an3}It bothers me that
he's gonna tell you,

20:04.328 --> 20:06.663
but he's not man enough to
say it to my [bleep] face.

20:06.747 --> 20:08.206
{\an1}- Some cowardly
[bleep] for sure.

20:08.290 --> 20:11.084
{\an3}- There's nothing on my level
of being military or Marine

20:11.168 --> 20:13.378
that Matt will ever stand for.

20:13.462 --> 20:15.130
- Yeah, I mean--
- So if that's what he's got,

20:15.213 --> 20:16.256
then that's all he's got.

20:16.340 --> 20:19.593
- Exactly.
- He needs to watch his mouth.

20:22.304 --> 20:24.306
- Okay, artists.
You have six hours

20:24.389 --> 20:27.351
<i>to create a famous work of art.</i>

20:27.434 --> 20:30.604
And your time begins now.

20:30.687 --> 20:31.563
- Whoo!

20:31.647 --> 20:33.148
- Yeah, go ahead and
take off your shirt.

20:33.231 --> 20:35.651
{\an3}Let's get this
stencil on there.

20:35.734 --> 20:36.902
<i>- This is a great test of</i>
<i>consistency,</i>

20:36.985 --> 20:38.987
{\an8}'cause it's actually having
to pay attention to details

20:39.071 --> 20:42.491
{\an8}that already exist and
recreating them.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.076
{\an3}- Can you straighten this leg
out a little bit?

20:44.159 --> 20:45.285
-<i> The proof is right there,</i>

20:45.369 --> 20:47.496
<i>working to compare the painting</i>
<i>to the tattoo.</i>

20:47.579 --> 20:50.832
The inconsistencies
are gonna be loud and clear.

20:50.916 --> 20:51.583
{\an3}- Just sit as still
as possible.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.752
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

20:59.925 --> 21:01.176
{\an8}- My strategy for the tattoo

21:01.259 --> 21:03.220
{\an8}<i>is to do all</i>
<i>the brushstrokes on it</i>

21:03.303 --> 21:06.348
{\an8}and make it look like
it's old and weathered.

21:06.431 --> 21:09.184
{\an3}It'll be really painterly
when I'm done.

21:12.270 --> 21:16.149
<i>I know Craig is gonna use some</i>
<i>goofy-ass [bleep] color palette</i>

21:16.233 --> 21:19.903
that Craig Foster loves
to [bleep] do in every tattoo,

21:19.987 --> 21:21.863
<i>and I'm gonna keep mine</i>
<i>true to the painting</i>

21:21.947 --> 21:24.825
<i>and I'm gonna beat Craig's ass.</i>

21:24.908 --> 21:26.118
- I'm just laying down
a bunch of blacks,

21:26.201 --> 21:29.705
and then, I say we're getting
all the dull colors in there.

21:29.788 --> 21:32.416
{\an8}There are certain colors
that I have seen the judges

21:32.499 --> 21:35.377
{\an8}go harshly on for doing on
certain kinds of skin tone,

21:35.460 --> 21:38.880
so I'm strategically
taking out certain colors.

21:38.964 --> 21:41.883
<i>I'm doing what the judges are</i>
<i>expecting here.</i>

21:41.967 --> 21:43.385
- Four hours remaining.

21:43.468 --> 21:45.137
<i>Four hours to go.</i>

21:45.220 --> 21:46.638
<i>[fast rock music]</i>

21:46.722 --> 21:49.474
- We'll get this
last chunk down here, then.

21:49.558 --> 21:53.186
<i>"Water Lilies" by Monet</i>
<i>is by far the most difficult</i>

21:53.270 --> 21:57.441
{\an8}'cause there's so much layering
happening in the painting.

21:57.524 --> 22:00.694
<i>Duffy and I are choosing to go</i>
<i>about this painting</i>

22:00.777 --> 22:02.154
<i>two different ways.</i>

22:02.237 --> 22:04.698
<i>She's using a zoomed-in</i>
<i>section to tattoo,</i>

22:04.781 --> 22:06.867
<i>and I'm using a little bit more</i>
<i>of the painting.</i>

22:06.950 --> 22:10.037
I want to make sure that
the painting is identifiable.

22:10.120 --> 22:10.954
- You see Duffy's?

22:11.038 --> 22:13.081
{\an3}- I saw it once,
and it was earlier on.

22:13.165 --> 22:15.709
How's she doing?
- It looks amazing.

22:17.586 --> 22:20.422
<i>- Monet specifically</i>
<i>painted his designs</i>

22:20.505 --> 22:22.257
<i>to be viewed from a distance.</i>

22:22.340 --> 22:24.384
{\an8}When you get up close on them,
they're really, really messy.

22:24.468 --> 22:27.929
<i>I need to take the same</i>
<i>approach with my tattoo.</i>

22:28.013 --> 22:29.681
{\an1}So, right now, I'm just going
through and trying to get,

22:29.765 --> 22:31.099
<i>like, shapes where they go.</i>

22:31.183 --> 22:32.851
<i>When you stand back</i>
<i>and look at this thing,</i>

22:32.934 --> 22:35.604
<i>it's gonna be nice and bright,</i>
<i>and it makes sense.</i>

22:35.687 --> 22:37.230
This is definitely
gonna get me the win.

22:40.442 --> 22:43.236
{\an3}- I'm finishing up
some of these blues in here,

22:43.320 --> 22:45.447
<i>kind of doing</i>
<i>these lighter tones.</i>

22:45.530 --> 22:47.491
<i>My strategy is to try</i>
<i>to keep the main elements</i>

22:47.574 --> 22:50.327
{\an8}in the painting that I feel
represent the painting.

22:50.410 --> 22:52.996
<i>The only thing</i>
<i>that I'm going to move</i>

22:53.080 --> 22:55.290
<i>is gonna be the moon over into</i>
<i>the center of the painting,</i>

22:55.373 --> 22:57.042
<i>just so I can get</i>
<i>all of the elements</i>

22:57.125 --> 23:00.045
<i>that need to be in this.</i>

23:03.215 --> 23:04.091
- [exhales]

23:04.174 --> 23:05.634
- How you doing, girl?

23:05.717 --> 23:06.551
- Hanging in.

23:06.635 --> 23:07.636
- She's over it.
<i>- Loving it?</i>

23:07.719 --> 23:08.970
- She's not liking me,
you know?

23:09.054 --> 23:10.430
<i>I didn't want "Starry Night,"</i>

23:10.514 --> 23:12.682
<i>because this thing looks</i>
<i>like a [bleep] crazy house</i>

23:12.766 --> 23:14.267
{\an8}of blue tones and yellow tones.

23:14.351 --> 23:15.394
{\an8}I don't even know how
this person did it with a brush,

23:15.477 --> 23:17.979
<i>much less how I'm gonna</i>
<i>duplicate this</i>

23:18.063 --> 23:19.940
<i>with a [bleep] tattoo machine.</i>

23:20.023 --> 23:22.359
Some things just don't work
for tattoos.

23:22.442 --> 23:25.779
- Two hours remaining, guys.
Two more hours.

23:25.862 --> 23:27.989
[dramatic music]

23:28.073 --> 23:30.367
- We're [bleep] way behind.

23:30.450 --> 23:32.994
{\an3}I mean, like,
ridiculously behind.

23:33.078 --> 23:34.746
I'm gonna switch to her.

23:34.830 --> 23:35.956
I'm gonna try to get her done,

23:36.039 --> 23:36.998
and then, we'll come back
to the angels.

23:37.082 --> 23:39.501
<i>This tattoo is huge.</i>

23:39.584 --> 23:43.004
<i>Man, this is horribly hard.</i>

23:43.088 --> 23:45.257
<i>I'm so pissed off</i>
<i>about what Matt did,</i>

23:45.340 --> 23:47.134
<i>coming after my character</i>
<i>and calling me names.</i>

23:47.217 --> 23:48.510
<i>If I don't finish</i>
<i>this painting,</i>

23:48.593 --> 23:49.970
<i>going head-to-head</i>
<i>against Matt,</i>

23:50.053 --> 23:52.806
<i>he's got me,</i>
<i>he's knocked me out.</i>

23:52.889 --> 23:53.640
{\an8}And I can't have that.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.895
- Oh, [bleep].

23:58.979 --> 24:00.772
[whimpering] Ow!

24:00.856 --> 24:02.899
<i>- This is the battle that I've</i>
<i>been looking forward to,</i>

24:02.983 --> 24:03.817
{\an8}go head-to-head with Chris.

24:03.900 --> 24:06.194
{\an8}But I'm at a complete
disadvantage.

24:06.278 --> 24:08.196
- [whimpers]
<i>- This canvas is screaming</i>

<i>and she's kicking her feet</i>
<i>like a two-year-old.</i>

24:09.531 --> 24:12.784
<i>I can't put a straight solid</i>
<i>line on this girl.</i>

24:12.868 --> 24:15.662
{\an1}Because you got some sweat
and stuff going on,

24:15.745 --> 24:18.623
it caused the face
to just smear away.

24:18.707 --> 24:21.751
<i>Once the stencil's gone, trying</i>
<i>to line up a new stencil on top</i>

24:21.835 --> 24:23.253

- I like this tattoo.

25:11.885 --> 25:13.887
<i>- The biggest problem for me</i>
<i>is the face.</i>

25:13.970 --> 25:15.096
It looks like Wilma Flintstone.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.306
<i>- There's zero consistency.</i>

25:16.389 --> 25:17.599
It's just not here.

25:18.183 --> 25:23.230
<i>[rock music]</i>

25:23.313 --> 25:25.482
- It's a [bleep] game.
We all have our strategies.

25:25.565 --> 25:27.192
But, dude,
I'm not gonna take somebody

25:27.275 --> 25:28.109
calling me a two-faced
[bleep] liar.

25:28.193 --> 25:29.945
- I'm not calling you
a two-faced liar.

25:30.028 --> 25:31.446
I came in there
and I told Tyler

25:31.529 --> 25:33.114
{\an3}your intention
of getting rid of him

25:33.198 --> 25:34.449
so that you can win
this [bleep].

25:34.532 --> 25:36.409
- Your strategy is stupid.
It's stupid.

25:36.493 --> 25:38.286
- But that's what you're doing.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.872
I've never been
a big enough dick

25:40.956 --> 25:42.415
<i>to send home my own guy.</i>

25:42.499 --> 25:44.542
You know what still makes you
even dumber on that one, Matt?

25:44.626 --> 25:47.045
Is that I've been growing him
some [bleep] weeks.

25:47.128 --> 25:48.964
- Because you need him here
as a crutch.

25:49.047 --> 25:49.548
- We've been--
<i>- You need somebody</i>

25:49.631 --> 25:51.299
<i>to be on your team.</i>

25:51.383 --> 25:52.467
You need somebody here
who you know has your back.

25:52.550 --> 25:54.344
Why else you
would you protect him?

25:54.427 --> 25:56.805
- Who do I need to have my back,

25:56.888 --> 25:58.640
Matt, on a competition
where one person wins--

25:58.723 --> 26:01.184
- 'Cause that's what you've had
the whole time.

26:01.268 --> 26:02.769
<i>You've always had</i>
<i>a [bleep] team.</i>

26:02.852 --> 26:04.312
<i>He's the last one you got,</i>

26:04.396 --> 26:05.981
and that's why you're freaking
the [bleep] out.

26:06.064 --> 26:09.985
- You [bleep] have no idea how
[bleep] ridiculous you sound.

26:10.068 --> 26:11.945
- We all [bleep] know it,
Chris.

26:12.028 --> 26:13.154
- Oh, my God.
- You're campaigning

26:13.238 --> 26:14.656
with these people
to do your bidding,

26:14.739 --> 26:17.242
to work your [bleep] personal
way to the top.

26:17.325 --> 26:19.494
- That's [bleep].
- That's your [bleep] strategy.

26:19.577 --> 26:21.579
- How [bleep] ridiculous?

<i>Each of you tattooed</i>

Tyler.

26:49.941 --> 26:52.193
<i>You went head-to-head</i>
<i>with Craig.</i>

26:52.277 --> 26:54.529
- Tyler, I think you did a great
job in translating this

26:54.612 --> 26:56.740
{\an8}<i>from the original painting</i>
<i>to a tattoo form.</i>

26:56.823 --> 27:00.910
{\an8}As far as capturing the feel,
the tone, the contrast,

27:00.994 --> 27:01.828
it is definitely there.

27:01.911 --> 27:03.913
- If you look at
the original painting,

27:03.997 --> 27:06.583
{\an8}there's tiny little white
scratchy lines in the face,

27:06.666 --> 27:08.626
{\an8}<i>and you brought those over</i>
<i>to the tattoo</i>

27:08.710 --> 27:11.212
{\an8}<i>in a way that's really</i>
<i>well done.</i>

27:11.296 --> 27:13.006
<i>Great use of consistency there.</i>

27:13.089 --> 27:15.175
It's really hard to get
the expression of that face,

27:15.258 --> 27:16.509
<i>and you found a way to do it,</i>

27:16.593 --> 27:17.552
which is what the most important
thing is in this painting,

27:17.635 --> 27:20.013
so well done.
- Thanks, guys.

27:22.807 --> 27:24.267
- Craig.

27:25.810 --> 27:29.022
{\an8}- Your color choices here
are very suspect.

27:29.105 --> 27:31.733
{\an8}<i>You have colors that don't</i>
<i>exist anywhere in the painting:</i>

27:31.816 --> 27:35.862
{\an8}<i>magenta, purple, that bright</i>
<i>orange and peach swoosh</i>

27:35.945 --> 27:36.946
{\an8}<i>to the right of the head.</i>

27:37.030 --> 27:38.281
- I just wanted something
that would last

27:38.365 --> 27:39.741
<i>on her skin over time,</i>

27:39.824 --> 27:41.284
{\an8}so I went with a stronger tone.

27:41.368 --> 27:43.703
{\an8}<i>- It's just not the same look.</i>
<i>It's not the same feel.</i>

27:43.787 --> 27:45.038
{\an8}-<i> I would also add that yours is</i>

27:45.121 --> 27:47.624
{\an8}<i>looking in a different</i>
<i>direction than the original.</i>

27:47.707 --> 27:48.958
- I'm happy with it--I had
a good time working with it.

27:49.042 --> 27:50.251
- Okay.
But, you know,

27:50.335 --> 27:51.419
you're here to be critiqued on
consistency and--

27:51.503 --> 27:53.338
- I understand.
- Not on whether

27:53.421 --> 27:54.589
you're happy with this.

27:54.672 --> 27:56.132
<i>And as far as</i>
<i>the consistency challenge,</i>

27:56.216 --> 27:58.718
pretty far off.

28:01.846 --> 28:04.599
{\an8}<i>Between Tyler and Craig,</i>
<i>do we have a winner?</i>

28:04.682 --> 28:06.267
{\an8}<i>- Tyler's attention to detail</i>
<i>that he did put in the face</i>

28:06.351 --> 28:08.645
{\an8}makes this really stand out.

28:08.728 --> 28:09.896
- I agree.
That's the best thing about his.

28:09.979 --> 28:12.774
- Winner of this head-to-head
competition is Tyler.

28:15.443 --> 28:16.861
Chris.

28:16.945 --> 28:18.905
<i>You went head-to-head</i>
<i>with Matt.</i>

28:18.988 --> 28:21.324
{\an8}<i>You did a nice job</i>
<i>in terms of consistency.</i>

28:21.408 --> 28:22.283
{\an8}<i>The placement of each one</i>

28:22.367 --> 28:26.079
{\an8}<i>of these little flowers</i>
<i>is spot on.</i>

28:26.162 --> 28:29.040
- But this tattoo has a largely
unfinished feel to it.

28:29.124 --> 28:30.792
<i>The weird way that</i>
<i>you have three feet</i>

28:30.875 --> 28:33.461
<i>and then one foot just</i>
<i>disappeared on her arm there</i>

28:33.545 --> 28:34.796
is a little bit awkward.

28:34.879 --> 28:36.214
- I had a tough canvas
on this one.

28:36.297 --> 28:37.715
<i>There was definitely a point</i>
<i>where I had one knee</i>

28:37.799 --> 28:39.968
on the chair just trying to get
to her tattoo to keep going.

28:40.051 --> 28:43.972
- The main focal point
of this image is the Venus.

28:44.055 --> 28:46.266
<i>That should have been</i>
<i>priority number one.</i>

28:46.349 --> 28:48.518
You finish that,
then start expanding out.

28:48.601 --> 28:49.394
<i>- The quality that</i>
<i>we're used to seeing you do,</i>

28:49.477 --> 28:52.230
it's just not here.

28:54.149 --> 28:55.442
<i>- Matt.</i>

28:57.444 --> 28:59.821
{\an8}Tell me what happened
here with your tattoo?

28:59.904 --> 29:01.197
{\an8}<i>- 30 minutes in,</i>
<i>she was a moving target.</i>

29:01.281 --> 29:04.617
{\an8}<i>- Were you able to finish what</i>
<i>you intended to do here today?</i>

29:04.701 --> 29:05.535
- No.
<i>- Doing so much,</i>

29:05.618 --> 29:06.828
<i>it took away a lot of time</i>

29:06.911 --> 29:09.998
for you to be able
to cherry one thing out.

29:10.081 --> 29:12.167
- If I'd have had any hint
from this girl

29:12.250 --> 29:13.585
that she would've done
as bad as she did,

29:13.668 --> 29:15.503
<i>I would've definitely</i>
<i>tried to get her</i>

29:15.587 --> 29:16.754
to do just the Venus figure
on the shell.

29:16.838 --> 29:18.465
- The biggest problem for me
is the face.

29:18.548 --> 29:20.091
<i>It looks like Wilma Flintstone,</i>

29:20.175 --> 29:23.178
<i>And that's the most crucial</i>
<i>part of that figure in a way.</i>

29:23.261 --> 29:24.137
<i>If there's one thing</i>
<i>you're gonna get right,</i>

29:24.220 --> 29:25.847
that would be the thing
to get right.

29:27.849 --> 29:30.977
- Between Chris and Matt,
who's the winner here?

29:31.060 --> 29:32.770
{\an8}<i>- I would give it to Chris.</i>
<i>There's something about Matt's.</i>

29:32.854 --> 29:35.398
{\an8}<i>It just doesn't have</i>
<i>the same degree of finish.</i>

29:35.482 --> 29:37.484
{\an8}<i>- If we're talking consistency,</i>

29:37.567 --> 29:38.693
{\an8}I got to give it to Chris.

29:38.776 --> 29:40.028
- I got to go with Chris.

29:40.111 --> 29:41.070
- I'll vote for Chris.

29:41.154 --> 29:42.197
<i>- The judges have decided.</i>

29:42.280 --> 29:45.617
The winner of the head-to-head
battle is Chris.

29:47.494 --> 29:49.162
- Kruseman.

29:49.245 --> 29:51.706
<i>You went head-to-head</i>
<i>with Erik.</i>

29:51.789 --> 29:53.166
- You did do a great job

29:53.249 --> 29:55.210
{\an8}<i>creating the texture</i>
<i>of this painting,</i>

29:55.293 --> 29:57.712
{\an8}<i>but there's zero consistency</i>
<i>in the sky.</i>

29:57.795 --> 29:59.547
{\an1}- The most crucial thing about
the composition of the painting,

29:59.631 --> 30:01.049
{\an8}<i>really,</i>
<i>is that swirl in the center.</i>

30:01.132 --> 30:02.425
{\an8}<i>I was surprised</i>
<i>you left that out.</i>

30:02.509 --> 30:03.551
{\an8}<i>- The most important part</i>
<i>for her</i>

30:03.635 --> 30:05.678
{\an8}<i>was the crazy whacked-out</i>
<i>tree on the side.</i>

30:05.762 --> 30:09.098
- But you just kind of
invented your own sky.

30:09.182 --> 30:10.141
<i>- I made--</i>
<i>- It's called "Starry Night."</i>

30:10.225 --> 30:12.810
Not a lot of consistency
in your translation.

30:15.730 --> 30:18.399
- Erik.

30:18.483 --> 30:19.943
You chose to

30:20.026 --> 30:21.361
{\an8}<i>change the composition</i>
<i>of this</i>

30:21.444 --> 30:23.154
{\an8}<i>to fit the rib cage,</i>
<i>is that correct?</i>

30:23.238 --> 30:24.739
{\an8}-<i> Yeah, I tried to take</i>
<i>the center of the painting</i>

30:24.822 --> 30:27.033
{\an8}<i>with the town, the tree,</i>
<i>and the swirl,</i>

30:27.116 --> 30:29.911
{\an8}<i>but I also felt</i>
<i>that the moon in the corner</i>

30:29.994 --> 30:31.496
{\an8}<i>needed to be in there as well.</i>

30:31.579 --> 30:33.122
{\an8}<i>So that was really</i>
<i>the only object</i>

30:33.206 --> 30:36.000
{\an8}in the painting
that I actually moved.

30:36.084 --> 30:37.418
- You made some smart
decisions

30:37.502 --> 30:39.254
{\an8}<i>in terms of adapting</i>
<i>this composition</i>

30:39.337 --> 30:40.713
{\an8}<i>to the part of the body</i>

30:40.797 --> 30:43.591
{\an8}and you did completely do
the swirls in the sky.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.969
- But the one thing that
Kruseman did really well is

30:46.052 --> 30:49.973
{\an8}<i>capture those little short,</i>
<i>hard slaps of paint strokes.</i>

30:50.056 --> 30:51.891
{\an8}<i>You have a lot of smooth,</i>
<i>blended areas of color.</i>

30:51.975 --> 30:54.185
{\an8}<i>You didn't really capture</i>
<i>the feel</i>

30:54.269 --> 30:56.396
<i>of this particular painting.</i>

30:57.522 --> 30:59.482
- We got to debate a win.

30:59.566 --> 31:01.317
- Erik definitely translated
the painting

31:01.401 --> 31:02.277
{\an8}<i>in a more faithful way.</i>

31:02.360 --> 31:03.361
{\an8}<i>He picked up on the swirls.</i>

31:03.444 --> 31:05.113
{\an8}<i>What I'm missing is</i>
<i>there's something limpid</i>

31:05.196 --> 31:06.823
{\an8}<i>in the execution,</i>
<i>something flat.</i>

31:06.906 --> 31:07.991
{\an8}<i>Kruseman's really has</i>
<i>an energy.</i>

31:08.074 --> 31:11.995
<i>- If you had your strokes</i>
<i>and his chosen layout,</i>

31:12.078 --> 31:13.413
it would be [bleep] great.

31:13.496 --> 31:16.124
- And I think neither of them
look exactly like the painting.

31:16.207 --> 31:18.501
- That's true.
- So, in that sense,

31:18.585 --> 31:20.545
I feel that
there's not a winner.

31:20.628 --> 31:21.462
- It's level.

31:21.546 --> 31:22.922
- Why should
one of you guys get a win?

31:26.092 --> 31:29.262
- The judges have decided
that there is no winner

31:29.345 --> 31:32.390
in this head-to-head battle.

31:32.473 --> 31:34.058
Katie.

31:34.142 --> 31:36.728
<i>You went head-to-head</i>
<i>with Duffy.</i>

31:36.811 --> 31:38.313
{\an8}I'm familiar with this painting,

31:38.396 --> 31:42.150
{\an8}<i>and I'm not entirely sure</i>
<i>if I would know what this is</i>

31:42.233 --> 31:43.026
{\an8}<i>if I was standing next to her.</i>

31:43.109 --> 31:44.819
- I felt like
it was very difficult

31:44.902 --> 31:46.487
to translate into a tattoo.

31:46.571 --> 31:48.406
- Your colors
are completely different

31:48.489 --> 31:49.824
{\an8}than the colors in the painting.

31:49.907 --> 31:51.534
{\an8}<i>In the painting,</i>
<i>there's some really bright,</i>

31:51.618 --> 31:54.829
{\an8}<i>vivid areas of green</i>
<i>with a really high contrast.</i>

31:54.912 --> 31:57.832
<i>You made those areas really</i>
<i>forest hunter green,</i>

31:57.915 --> 32:00.335
{\an8}so it changes
the painting itself.

32:00.418 --> 32:02.545
{\an8}-<i> You've got one of the harder</i>
<i>paintings to reproduce</i>

32:02.629 --> 32:04.088
{\an8}<i>and one of the hardest parts</i>
<i>of the body.</i>

32:04.172 --> 32:06.090
{\an8}<i>Definitely shows</i>
<i>there's a struggle here.</i>

32:06.174 --> 32:07.967
It's a rough one.

32:10.136 --> 32:11.137
- Duffy.

32:13.222 --> 32:14.682
-<i> As far as consistency goes,</i>

32:14.766 --> 32:16.809
{\an8}<i>I do love that you were able</i>
<i>to capture the brushstrokes.</i>

32:16.893 --> 32:19.270
{\an8}<i>You've captured</i>
<i>the color palette,</i>

32:19.354 --> 32:20.188
{\an8}<i>captured the composition.</i>

32:20.271 --> 32:23.149
You made a lot of
really smart choices.

32:23.232 --> 32:25.193
<i>- I would've liked to have seen</i>
<i>a little more crispness</i>

32:25.276 --> 32:27.070
<i>in the way the flowers</i>
<i>were executed.</i>

32:27.153 --> 32:29.030
But you chose the shape wisely.

32:29.113 --> 32:30.907
<i>You fit it to the body well.</i>
<i>It was smart.</i>

32:30.990 --> 32:32.617
<i>It's more recognizable.</i>

32:32.700 --> 32:34.035
You can see this is a Monet
right away.

32:34.118 --> 32:35.703
- Thank you.

32:35.787 --> 32:37.038
- Good job.

32:37.121 --> 32:40.166
{\an8}- Between Katie and Duffy,
who's gonna take this one?

32:40.249 --> 32:41.542
{\an8}<i>- Duffy really captured</i>
<i>the spirit of the Monet</i>

32:41.626 --> 32:43.711
{\an8}<i>a little bit more.</i>

32:43.795 --> 32:45.546
{\an8}<i>It definitely has</i>
<i>that painterly feel.</i>

32:45.630 --> 32:47.382
{\an8}I'm leaning towards Duffy's.

32:47.465 --> 32:49.550
- I'd go with Duffy as well.

32:49.634 --> 32:50.718
- The edge goes
