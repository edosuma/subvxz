on what you mean by serious.

a lot of relationships,

took any of them seriously.

Have I told you
about my parents?

Enough music.

11:01.494 --> 11:06.866
( <i>all arguing</i> )

11:06.866 --> 11:08.301
Everybody, listen!

11:08.301 --> 11:10.703
I think we're all getting a
little out of control here.

11:10.703 --> 11:11.938
I'm fine.

11:11.938 --> 11:15.308
Although I have
a strange urge to do jazz hands.

11:15.308 --> 11:17.343
Look, we're arguing and
insulting each other

11:17.343 --> 11:19.712
and we're losing sight
of what's really important.

11:19.712 --> 11:22.682
Aaron and I are about to embark
on the most significant journey

11:22.682 --> 11:25.318
of our lives, and we'll need all
the support we can get.

11:25.318 --> 11:27.854
At the end of the day, the
important thing to remember

11:27.854 --> 11:29.756
is that Aaron loves me,
and I love Harvey.

11:32.859 --> 11:34.861
Did I just say Harvey?

11:40.066 --> 11:43.536
Harvey?
You love... Harvey?

11:43.536 --> 11:44.437
No, not Harvey.

11:44.437 --> 11:45.705
Aaron, you.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.540
Well, you said Harvey.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.374
You did.

11:48.374 --> 11:49.175
Yep.

11:49.175 --> 11:50.510
She did.

11:50.510 --> 11:52.278
I know.

11:52.278 --> 11:53.479
Okay, I know
I said it.

11:53.479 --> 11:54.614
I, I don't deny
that I said it.

11:54.614 --> 11:55.415
But I didn't
mean to say it.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.283
I don't know
what I was thinking.

11:57.283 --> 11:58.885
I guess Harvey's
just been on my mind
a lot lately.

11:58.885 --> 12:02.388
Oh, well, that makes me,
<i>Aaron,</i> feel so much better.

12:02.388 --> 12:05.091
It sounds to me like
a certain young lady

12:05.091 --> 12:06.759
has some serious issues.

12:06.759 --> 12:08.962
Issues? I don't
have issues.

12:08.962 --> 12:10.830
Aaron, honey,
tell her I love you.

12:10.830 --> 12:12.265
Tell her!

12:13.633 --> 12:17.103
Sabrina, I think I have
to agree with my mother on this.

12:17.103 --> 12:18.338
No, don't
start now, son.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.773
It's a slippery slope.

12:20.773 --> 12:23.743
And here I thought things
were going so well.

12:23.743 --> 12:24.744
No, please don't go.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.312
We haven't even
had dinner yet.

12:26.312 --> 12:28.615
Oh, and who do you think
has an appetite right now?

12:28.615 --> 12:29.582
I do.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.657
How could I have been so stupid?
I ruined everything.

12:37.657 --> 12:38.691
Except for the chicken,

12:38.691 --> 12:40.627
which is like
a little slice of heaven.

12:40.627 --> 12:42.328
I think you're overreacting.

12:42.328 --> 12:44.364
Harvey will be fine.

12:44.364 --> 12:47.233
I tell guys that I love them all
the time and don't mean it.

12:47.233 --> 12:49.102
They're surprisingly resilient.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.771
Is it possible you still have
feelings for Harvey?

12:51.771 --> 12:52.772
No.
Not possible.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.340
It was a slip of the tongue.

12:54.340 --> 12:56.175
You know, tongues get slippery.

12:56.175 --> 12:58.211
They're like a water slide
for words.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.213
I don't think this
was just a slip of the tongue.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.081
I think it was a Freudian slip.

13:02.081 --> 13:04.751
And as Freud said,
"There are no accidents."

13:04.751 --> 13:06.452
( <i>German accent</i> )
Perhaps the root
of the problem

13:06.452 --> 13:09.622
lies somewhere in your
subconscious desires, no?

13:09.622 --> 13:13.259
No. The root of my problems
is that I'm talking to a cat.

13:13.259 --> 13:15.828
Why won't Aaron call me back?

13:15.828 --> 13:18.431
Maybe because
you called him "Harvey."

13:18.431 --> 13:19.732
Thank you, Dr. Duh.

13:19.732 --> 13:21.034
But why did I say that?

13:21.034 --> 13:22.235
Maybe Roxie's right.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.137
Maybe I should talk to somebody.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.239
What am I, chopped liver?

13:26.239 --> 13:29.142
Mmmm. Liver.
I think our time is up.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.143
Yeah, I'll say.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.778
"I need to get
some things off my chest.

13:31.778 --> 13:33.680
Help me find the shrink
who is the best."

13:36.416 --> 13:38.017
Hey, swanky.

13:38.017 --> 13:40.386
Oooh, look, there's even
lemon in the water.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.557
Hello, I'm Dr. Jacobs.

13:46.659 --> 13:47.760
Sabrina?

13:47.760 --> 13:50.396
Shirley? You're the best
psychologist in Boston?

13:50.396 --> 13:53.032
I got to be more specific
with my incantations.

13:53.032 --> 13:54.300
What are you doing here

13:54.300 --> 13:57.070
besides spitting citric acid
all over the leather?

13:57.070 --> 13:59.405
Uh, oh, well, I thought
I was going to bare my soul

13:59.405 --> 14:02.575
and fix my relationship, but,
uh, best laid plans...

14:02.575 --> 14:03.609
I should probably go.

14:03.609 --> 14:04.210
Probably.

14:04.210 --> 14:06.212
I don't think
conflict of interests

14:06.212 --> 14:08.514
even begins to cover this.

14:08.514 --> 14:11.551
Look, Shirley... Dr. Jacobs...

14:11.551 --> 14:12.685
I know you probably don't
believe this,

14:12.685 --> 14:15.955
but Freudian slip or not,
I love Aaron.

14:15.955 --> 14:17.056
Jacobs.

14:17.056 --> 14:18.791
Your son. Very much.

14:18.791 --> 14:19.826
See ya.

14:20.393 --> 14:21.928
I've got to say,

14:21.928 --> 14:24.597
I am impressed how
forcefully and directly

14:24.597 --> 14:26.566
you're addressing
this problem.

14:26.566 --> 14:28.134
You are?
I mean, that's me.

14:28.134 --> 14:31.537
Sabrina "Always Addressing
Things Forcefully" Spellman.

14:31.537 --> 14:33.773
Sabrina, can I talk to you
as a professional?

14:33.773 --> 14:36.442
Suppose you just talk to me
as my future mother-in-law.

14:36.442 --> 14:38.111
Stay away from my son.

14:38.111 --> 14:39.912
Professional it is.
Good choice.

14:39.912 --> 14:42.248
Sabrina, I don't think
you know what you want.

14:42.248 --> 14:44.250
I don't think your know
your own heart.

14:44.250 --> 14:45.852
I think I know
my own heart.

14:45.852 --> 14:48.254
I mean, not that I'd recognize
it walking down the street.

14:49.155 --> 14:49.856
But you're not really one

14:49.856 --> 14:51.691
for the witty aside, are you?

14:51.691 --> 14:53.459
I think you have to look
deep within your heart

14:53.459 --> 14:55.595
and figure out
what's really going on.

14:55.595 --> 14:58.965
And once you've done that,
we'll have dinner again.

14:58.965 --> 15:00.600
That's it?
Easy.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.301
See you in about
four years.

15:02.301 --> 15:03.636
Four years?

15:03.636 --> 15:04.704
At least.

15:04.704 --> 15:07.807
There are no short cuts
in mental health.

15:07.807 --> 15:11.244
So, I'm guessing it's too soon
to start calling you "Mom"?

15:12.311 --> 15:15.481
See?
Not even a smile.

15:15.481 --> 15:17.450
♪ Harmony, harmony ♪

15:17.450 --> 15:20.787
♪ Gosh, we're feeling swell. ♪

15:20.787 --> 15:23.022
You ever have a song you just
can't get out of your head?

15:23.022 --> 15:25.725
The Meow Mix jingle
comes to mind.

15:25.725 --> 15:28.094
Oh, thanks.
There it is again.

15:30.963 --> 15:33.299
Why does it seem like
you're here more than I am?

15:33.299 --> 15:35.368
I figure I should be around.

15:35.368 --> 15:37.036
Seeing as you love me.

15:37.036 --> 15:38.404
Look, that was a mistake.

15:38.404 --> 15:41.641
And awful, horrible mistake
that should never have happened.

15:41.641 --> 15:44.210
Is that any way to talk
to the man you love?

15:44.210 --> 15:45.812
Harvey, please,
I don't have time for this.

15:45.812 --> 15:47.113
I have to look
deep within my heart

15:47.113 --> 15:48.781
and find out why
I said it in the first place.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.383
I'm guessing this is
going to involve

15:50.383 --> 15:51.751
a lot of pinging and pointing.

15:51.751 --> 15:53.986
Good guess.

15:53.986 --> 15:54.987
Let's see.

15:54.987 --> 15:56.322
Heart.

15:56.322 --> 15:58.357
"Lonely..."
"Be still my beating..."

15:58.357 --> 16:00.059
"Left in San Francisco..."

16:00.059 --> 16:01.360
Maps of... that's it!

16:01.360 --> 16:02.428
A map of my heart.

16:02.428 --> 16:03.663
What could be easier?

16:05.498 --> 16:06.966
Just about anything.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.902
Why are these things
always so confusing?

16:09.902 --> 16:12.205
Oh, good, there's
an information booth.

16:14.173 --> 16:15.575
( <i>rings bell</i> )
Excuse me?

16:15.575 --> 16:17.777
Oh, hello.
Welcome to
Sabrina's Heart.

16:17.777 --> 16:20.480
Are you here to become
a patron of the hearts?

16:20.480 --> 16:22.415
No, actually I'm here
to look deep within it.

16:22.415 --> 16:23.249
Oh, well, excellent.

16:23.249 --> 16:24.984
There's a map and...

16:24.984 --> 16:25.985
Oh, my gosh.

16:25.985 --> 16:26.986
You're her.

16:26.986 --> 16:27.987
It's you.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.822
I've always wanted
to meet you.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.491
You almost came through
my throat last time

16:31.491 --> 16:32.492
I rode a roller coaster.

16:32.492 --> 16:35.361
I think I was more frightened
than you that day.

16:36.762 --> 16:37.930
What's that?

16:37.930 --> 16:39.599
Oh, the jalapenos
you had for lunch.

16:43.769 --> 16:45.071
Sorry.

16:45.071 --> 16:46.072
Oh, not a problem.

16:46.072 --> 16:47.073
Now if you'll follow me,

16:47.073 --> 16:48.541
we'll start
in the left ventricle.

16:49.942 --> 16:52.778
Korean? How many Korean tourists
do you actually get here?

16:52.778 --> 16:54.780
You'd be surprised.

16:56.315 --> 16:57.550
Oh, I love blue.

16:57.550 --> 17:00.219
I know,
we've got
scads of it.

17:00.219 --> 17:03.990
Sweet Tarts!
Oh, I love Sweet Tarts.

17:03.990 --> 17:06.058
Toaster waffles.
Oh, I--

17:06.058 --> 17:08.561
Love them,
I know.

17:08.561 --> 17:11.531
Strangely, one
of our most
popular exhibits.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.900
You know, I was worried
that my heart would reveal

17:13.900 --> 17:15.868
all these deep dark secrets,
but it's really very...

17:15.868 --> 17:17.503
Cracked?!

17:17.503 --> 17:18.504
I don't get it.

17:18.504 --> 17:19.805
I work out,
I eat right.

17:19.805 --> 17:20.806
Oh, you're fine.

17:20.806 --> 17:21.741
Every heart gets broken.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.376
This is where Harvey
broke yours.

17:23.376 --> 17:24.744
As they say,

17:24.744 --> 17:27.780
"Time and a couple of day
laborers heal all wounds."

17:27.780 --> 17:28.848
Aaron!

17:28.848 --> 17:30.449
See, I knew it.

17:30.449 --> 17:32.118
I love Aaron.

17:32.118 --> 17:33.486
Yeah, again, I know.

17:33.486 --> 17:35.121
I mean, not only is he
in my heart, but I've got him

17:35.121 --> 17:37.256
on a pedestal, which may not be
the healthiest thing,

17:37.256 --> 17:39.725
but I'll work
on that later.
Yeah, later, yeah.

17:39.725 --> 17:43.095
And also I guess that comment
about Harvey really was
just a slip of the tongue.

17:43.095 --> 17:44.096
Hey, Harvey.

17:44.096 --> 17:45.097
Harvey!

17:45.097 --> 17:47.033
What's Harvey doing here
in his own room?

17:47.033 --> 17:49.936
With a plasma screen TV.
Is that real plasma?

17:49.936 --> 17:53.706
Harvey obviously occupies a very
special place in your heart.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.241
Well, why is Aaron
out in the hallway

17:55.241 --> 17:56.409
on a crummy pedestal?

17:56.409 --> 17:58.377
Well, Harvey's part
of our permanent collection,

17:58.377 --> 18:00.313
and things in the hallway
are just temporary.

18:00.313 --> 18:01.847
Temporary?

18:01.847 --> 18:03.416
Oh, don't you remember
two years ago

18:03.416 --> 18:04.417
when you loved orange?

18:04.417 --> 18:05.918
It was the new black
or something?

18:05.918 --> 18:07.386
If I never see
that color again...

18:07.386 --> 18:09.155
Okay, look, Aaron
is not temporary.

18:09.155 --> 18:11.424
We're getting married.
Till death do us part?

18:11.424 --> 18:13.426
You can't get
more permanent than that.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.861
Well, you really
haven't known him that long.

18:15.861 --> 18:18.130
I'll take it up
with the people upstairs.

18:18.130 --> 18:19.465
The people upstairs are me!

18:19.465 --> 18:21.767
No wonder I've been
blurting out Harvey's name.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.369
We got to find a room for Aaron.

18:23.369 --> 18:25.304
Oh, no, no, please don't,
no, that's the...

18:25.304 --> 18:26.672
Don't, don't that's the...

18:28.874 --> 18:30.776
Billy Johnson!
Oh, he was my first crush.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.645
He ate a caterpillar
just to impress me.

18:32.645 --> 18:33.679
Eww!

18:33.679 --> 18:35.114
Don't open that door!

18:35.114 --> 18:37.783
Oh! Puppies!
I love puppies!

18:37.783 --> 18:39.819
Yeah, you don't have
to clean up after them.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.420
Look, Aaron is here to stay.

18:41.420 --> 18:43.456
He needs a room
and he needs it now.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.157
Somebody's got to go.

18:45.157 --> 18:47.093
Billy,
pack it up!

18:47.093 --> 18:49.395
The heart has an infinite
capacity for love.

18:49.395 --> 18:50.830
Rooms get built over time.

18:50.830 --> 18:53.199
Well, I don't have time.
I need a room now.

18:53.199 --> 18:56.002
Knock yourself out.

18:56.002 --> 18:58.070
I wonder how Aaron would feel
about a lean-to

18:58.070 --> 19:00.406
and a sleeping bag.

19:02.408 --> 19:04.343
If only Jimmy Carter
could see me now.

19:06.879 --> 19:10.249
This has got to be good
for my heart.

19:10.249 --> 19:11.384
It's so frustrating.

19:11.384 --> 19:13.519
She says she loves me,
and yet,

19:13.519 --> 19:16.022
I have this constant feeling
that I'm just some guy

19:16.022 --> 19:17.490
passing through her life.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.326
I hate to tell you this, dear,
but I really don't think

19:20.326 --> 19:23.262
there's anything Sabrina can do
to change how you feel.

19:23.262 --> 19:25.164
( <i>sighs</i> )

19:25.164 --> 19:26.298
Come on, Come on!

19:26.298 --> 19:28.567
You're hammering
like a little boy!

19:28.567 --> 19:29.568
You're mean.

19:29.568 --> 19:32.738
I'm glad I dumped you
for Susie Gibson.

19:34.440 --> 19:35.608
Maybe you're right.

19:35.608 --> 19:37.576
Maybe I should just
call the whole thing off.

19:37.576 --> 19:39.345
Well, if you think that's best.

19:41.147 --> 19:42.214
Voila!

19:42.214 --> 19:45.017
Your very own room.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.018
Rent stabilized,

19:46.018 --> 19:48.020
an unbreakable lease,
and a partial view of the lungs.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.321
I love it!

19:49.321 --> 19:51.857
Won't be needing this anymore.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.360
Ow!

19:54.360 --> 19:57.229
Well, welcome to your new home.

20:00.766 --> 20:02.568
All right, all right.

20:02.568 --> 20:04.370
You've convinced me.

20:04.370 --> 20:08.374
I guess I'll just call Sabrina
and tell her...

20:08.374 --> 20:10.609
that I love her,
and I know that the other night

20:10.609 --> 20:11.977
was just a horrible mistake.

20:11.977 --> 20:13.612
What?

20:13.612 --> 20:16.916
You just have to believe me when
I tell you I know I have

20:16.916 --> 20:18.918
a special place
in Sabrina's heart.

20:18.918 --> 20:21.887
And I just have to remember
that we all have pasts.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.889
But Sabrina
is definitely my future.

20:25.925 --> 20:28.761
Maybe you
don't know everything, Mom.

20:30.496 --> 20:34.433
If only I could blame
his mother.

20:39.638 --> 20:42.975
What I wouldn't give
for a guy that forgiving
and understanding.

20:42.975 --> 20:45.411
Heck, I'd settle
for his good looks
and money.

20:45.411 --> 20:47.313
Okay, lunch is ready.

20:49.281 --> 20:52.384
Wow.
This looks great, thanks.

20:52.384 --> 20:54.153
Thank you.
