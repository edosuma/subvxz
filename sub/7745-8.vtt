00:08.802 --> 00:10.011
<i>Previously on</i> Nurse <i>Jackie...</i>

00:10.095 --> 00:11.304
What do you want?

00:11.388 --> 00:14.891
I want to know in a life-death business
that we're all here.

00:14.974 --> 00:16.810
She forgot to schedule two nurse shifts.

00:16.893 --> 00:19.312
Hell, she even named me chief
without telling anyone.

00:19.437 --> 00:20.522
It's getting dangerous.

00:20.605 --> 00:23.108
She's not talking about it.
She's obviously not doing anything about it.

00:23.233 --> 00:26.152
If we could get her to take a blood test,
we might get some answers.

00:26.236 --> 00:27.737
Things have to change
if you're going to stay here.

00:28.321 --> 00:29.322
You have to get better.

00:29.406 --> 00:32.325
So from now on, I am going to teach
and you are going to learn.

00:32.826 --> 00:35.161
You're 17, she is 14.

00:35.578 --> 00:36.705
This is not happening.

00:37.163 --> 00:38.748
I don't think I should be here.

00:39.749 --> 00:41.334
Danny, let's just go.

00:41.418 --> 00:44.212
I know what I did was wrong.
I broke up with him and everything, okay?

00:44.754 --> 00:46.172
It's not gonna happen again.

01:58.828 --> 02:00.330
- Look at this.
- No, put it away.

02:01.372 --> 02:02.874
You see that?

02:14.260 --> 02:16.012
- You all right?
- Yeah.

02:16.179 --> 02:18.014
Yeah, just thought I heard something.

02:18.097 --> 02:21.017
Not to worry. As a sworn peace officer,
I am here to protect you.

02:22.519 --> 02:24.103
Yeah, I'm feeling pretty safe.

02:24.187 --> 02:26.815
Good. That means my work here is done.

02:27.190 --> 02:30.610
Can I tell you how lucky I am you were able
to get the night off on such short notice?

02:30.693 --> 02:33.530
Are you kidding me?
Zoey was thrilled for the hours.

02:33.655 --> 02:35.532
It was a piece of cake.

02:35.615 --> 02:37.826
Remind me to buy her a house.

02:42.664 --> 02:44.874
Are you trying to get me upstairs?

02:44.958 --> 02:46.292
How am I doing?

02:46.376 --> 02:48.962
- Fuck! Jesus Christ, Kevin.
- Oh, God.

02:49.587 --> 02:51.089
For God's sake.

02:51.172 --> 02:52.465
What are you doing here?

02:52.549 --> 02:54.968
Grace forgot her backpack
'cause she has a test.

02:55.051 --> 02:58.805
I was gonna run in and... I'm really sorry.

02:58.972 --> 03:00.723
It's in the kitchen.

03:04.269 --> 03:06.187
Jesus Christ, you don't have a
goddamn cell phone?

03:06.271 --> 03:07.438
She has a test.

03:07.522 --> 03:09.566
So that gives you the right
to barge in here unannounced?

03:09.649 --> 03:10.733
Jesus Christ, Kevin.

03:10.817 --> 03:12.777
Yeah, well, you usually work Tuesday night.

03:12.861 --> 03:15.196
Do you have any idea what I went through
to get this goddamn night off?

03:15.280 --> 03:18.408
How many people I owe
so I can have one night to myself?

03:19.075 --> 03:20.702
Jesus Christ. Thank you for ruining it.

03:30.086 --> 03:32.630
I am so sorry you had to hear that.

03:33.423 --> 03:36.259
So maybe we should do this another time.

03:37.927 --> 03:39.637
Really?

03:41.139 --> 03:42.557
We'll start over.

03:43.516 --> 03:46.394
Want me to make you another lasagna?

03:46.728 --> 03:49.439
Maybe... Maybe I'll call you tomorrow.

03:49.981 --> 03:51.441
Have lunch or something.

03:53.610 --> 03:55.361
Okay.

04:07.540 --> 04:10.418
I'll be right back, honey.

04:10.835 --> 04:14.047
Jesus Christ, where the hell
have you been all morning, Gloria?

04:14.297 --> 04:15.506
<i>I don't know what I was thinking.</i>

04:15.632 --> 04:17.884
Coming through!
I thought I wasn't working today.

04:17.967 --> 04:19.469
I can see the hospital from here.

04:19.677 --> 04:21.220
<i>Do me a favor. Go into my office,</i>

04:21.304 --> 04:24.265
<i>turn my lights on
and make it look like I'm there.</i>

04:24.474 --> 04:25.808
All right.

04:30.396 --> 04:32.982
Any clue where Akalitus is?

04:33.608 --> 04:35.818
No. Probably some meeting.

04:35.985 --> 04:38.571
I blew up my morning to be here,
and look, she's not.

04:39.197 --> 04:40.198
She's done this before.

04:40.281 --> 04:42.784
I know.
Administrators have lots of meetings.

04:44.035 --> 04:46.162
Sorry. The meeting ran late.

04:47.038 --> 04:48.790
- Told you.
- You forgot about our meeting.

04:49.248 --> 04:51.209
Just like the last one
and all of the other little details

04:51.292 --> 04:52.710
that you can't seem to keep up with.

04:52.835 --> 04:54.087
May I remind you that you work for me?

04:54.170 --> 04:56.172
No, I work for the patients.

04:56.756 --> 04:59.968
And if this job is moving
a little too fast for you,

05:00.051 --> 05:01.594
maybe I should go to the board.

05:01.678 --> 05:03.262
Big mistake.

05:03.596 --> 05:06.182
Jackie, it's okay.
I'll escort him to the board myself.

05:06.474 --> 05:07.934
'Cause I just came from there.

05:08.017 --> 05:09.727
And you know what I was doing up there?

05:09.811 --> 05:12.271
Explaining why my department is
so behind on its revenue.

05:12.355 --> 05:13.398
And you know why?

05:13.481 --> 05:15.942
My ER chief is so pathetically behind
on his paperwork

05:16.025 --> 05:19.654
that I can't submit billing,
but I took the hit and covered your ass.

05:19.737 --> 05:21.114
I'm a doctor, not a bookkeeper.

05:21.239 --> 05:23.199
You want to stay my ER chief,

05:24.534 --> 05:26.411
then learn to be both.

05:34.085 --> 05:36.212
A meeting with the board, very nice.

05:42.844 --> 05:45.138
What is up with Akalitus' blood test?

05:45.221 --> 05:48.057
It's on rush.
I owe my guy Knicks tickets, by the way.

05:48.224 --> 05:51.602
It's got to be faster. Prentiss is
threatening to report her to the board.

05:51.894 --> 05:55.940
Christ. All right.
I'll get him a Melo jersey, I guess.

05:56.065 --> 05:57.316
All right.

05:58.401 --> 06:01.320
This is Chef Eric Rios and his paring knife.

06:01.404 --> 06:04.407
Sous-chef. And this is a boning knife.

06:05.533 --> 06:06.909
Aptly named.

06:07.452 --> 06:09.078
Topical and suture kit.

06:10.204 --> 06:12.999
So tell me something.
What comes first, patients or paperwork?

06:13.291 --> 06:15.918
You know what you need?
An organizing wizard.

06:28.681 --> 06:30.058
Whoa.

06:30.183 --> 06:32.393
What do you mean, "Whoa"?
Come on, it's not that bad.

06:32.769 --> 06:34.020
Don't worry.

06:34.103 --> 06:35.438
I have a system.

06:35.563 --> 06:39.108
Action. Archive. Discard.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.444
It's all about piles.

06:41.527 --> 06:42.737
Okay, no, just...

06:42.945 --> 06:48.409
Dr. Prentiss, I am going to touch your stuff.

06:49.202 --> 06:52.955
You are not going to like it,
but you are going to have to get over it.

06:55.124 --> 06:57.126
Two-for-one doctor sale.

06:57.210 --> 06:59.587
Lungs clear? Febrile? Respiratory distress?

06:59.670 --> 07:01.464
Yes, no, and no.

07:02.131 --> 07:04.592
Ask Mrs. Lee
how long she's been coughing.

07:06.719 --> 07:08.262
Okay, Mrs. Lee?

07:09.680 --> 07:11.349
How long you been...

07:11.432 --> 07:12.892
She speaks English.

07:12.975 --> 07:15.770
Fuckin' A. I'm a bank teller.

07:16.395 --> 07:18.898
I can't... In customers' faces.

07:20.358 --> 07:22.151
Doesn't sound major,
but order a chest X-ray.

07:22.235 --> 07:24.904
If it comes back negative,
send her home with some Robitussin, okay?

07:25.530 --> 07:27.865
Talked to my guy.
Test results should be in after lunch.

07:27.949 --> 07:29.784
- Okay. I'll call you when I get back.
- Okay.

07:33.996 --> 07:35.748
<i>This is Vice-Principal Davis.</i>

07:35.832 --> 07:38.084
<i>Please let Grace know that leaving campus</i>

07:38.167 --> 07:40.336
<i>for lunch will be marked
as truancy next time.</i>

07:40.545 --> 07:42.672
<i>Apparently, she left without telling.</i>

07:49.887 --> 07:51.556
See? I pick up every time you call.

07:51.764 --> 07:53.349
- Where are you?
- I'm at Uno's.

07:53.516 --> 07:54.684
<i>Jesus.</i>

07:54.767 --> 07:56.853
<i>- Uno's is not school.
-It's for school.</i>

07:57.019 --> 07:59.355
Model UN. It's fine, Mom. I've got to go.

08:12.160 --> 08:13.619
You hear this?

08:13.703 --> 08:16.539
The sweet, sweet sound of organization.

08:16.789 --> 08:18.416
Yeah, that's great.

08:18.875 --> 08:22.628
I'm going to The Container Store
on my lunch break,

08:23.045 --> 08:26.048
and I will need your credit card,
no questions asked.

08:26.299 --> 08:29.010
Love The Container Store.
It changed my life.

08:33.139 --> 08:34.265
Grace.

08:35.391 --> 08:37.727
Finish your food, say goodbye
and get back to school.

08:38.060 --> 08:39.979
Oh, my God, you're embarrassing.

08:40.062 --> 08:41.439
That's too bad, isn't it?

08:41.522 --> 08:43.566
I'm here like I said I was,

08:43.649 --> 08:46.360
prepping for Model UN like I said I was.
We're Guatemala.

08:46.444 --> 08:48.905
Model UN can't take place
in the school cafeteria?

08:49.363 --> 08:51.908
We're sampling international cuisine.

08:52.241 --> 08:53.784
Quesadilla?

08:56.412 --> 08:57.496
What?

08:57.914 --> 08:59.624
Who's sitting there?

09:01.500 --> 09:04.420
Are you kidding me?
I told you I broke up with Danny.

09:04.587 --> 09:07.924
Grace, you do not get to walk away
from me when I'm talking to you.

09:08.007 --> 09:11.093
Talking to me?
You're yelling at me in the middle of Uno's.

09:11.469 --> 09:13.804
All right, listen to me, Grace.
I understand being a teenager sucks.

09:13.888 --> 09:16.557
Let me tell you something.
Being the mother of a teenager also sucks,

09:16.724 --> 09:19.852
especially today when my
teenager is a kid who cuts school,

09:20.436 --> 09:24.106
a kid who gives me
some Guatemala Model UN bullshit,

09:24.232 --> 09:27.568
a kid who is probably seeing a guy
I told her she couldn't see anymore.

09:29.654 --> 09:31.113
Jesus, Mom, I'm not seeing him,

09:31.197 --> 09:34.575
which means that you're yelling at me
for something I'm not even doing.

09:39.455 --> 09:40.915
Get back to school.

09:40.998 --> 09:42.625
Do not do this again.

09:45.836 --> 09:47.255
Quesadillas are Mexican.

09:50.216 --> 09:51.801
There you go. Look at that.

09:51.884 --> 09:53.844
A sandwich you've got
to unhinge your jaw to eat.

09:54.053 --> 09:56.097
Oh, boy, what a day.

09:56.180 --> 09:58.432
This is exactly what I needed.

10:02.019 --> 10:05.147
Okay, let's talk
about my husband coming in last night.

10:06.983 --> 10:08.651
I am so sorry.

10:08.985 --> 10:11.195
Nah, it's a story now, right?

10:11.779 --> 10:13.823
And he apologized.

10:14.073 --> 10:15.491
I heard him.

10:20.329 --> 10:21.914
Yeah, all right. What else?

10:21.998 --> 10:24.792
Well, since you asked,

10:25.334 --> 10:27.253
from what I heard, which was,

10:27.336 --> 10:30.006
well, pretty much everything,

10:30.131 --> 10:31.716
maybe you overreacted a little bit.

10:31.924 --> 10:35.553
The man comes in and doesn't even think
that maybe I have a life,

10:35.636 --> 10:37.722
and I get mad, so I'm overreacting?

10:37.805 --> 10:41.142
Look, I know how it goes early on.
I had my own split.

10:41.267 --> 10:43.978
Shit happens. You got old patterns.
You just work it out.

10:45.980 --> 10:46.981
And?

10:48.482 --> 10:49.525
And...

10:54.322 --> 10:56.115
I just want to know
why you had to lie to him.

10:57.867 --> 11:00.619
You know, about changing shifts

11:00.703 --> 11:02.830
and calling in favors to get the night off.

11:03.873 --> 11:05.624
You told me it was cake.

11:05.708 --> 11:07.418
What is this, the Boy Scouts?

11:07.501 --> 11:11.047
No, but I get lied to every friggin' day.

11:11.714 --> 11:13.674
Speeders aren't speeding,
junkies aren't using.

11:13.758 --> 11:15.551
Lying's like the default mode in my world.

11:16.677 --> 11:17.678
Junkies.

11:19.430 --> 11:21.640
- Oh, no, no. Honey, no, no.
- No.

11:21.724 --> 11:23.559
- No, that's...
- I'm sober for a year,

11:23.642 --> 11:24.935
and I'm still getting this shit.

11:25.019 --> 11:26.228
- Now I'm getting it from you?
- Okay.

11:26.312 --> 11:28.314
Okay, you're not getting anything from me.

11:28.397 --> 11:31.150
Look at me. Look at me.

11:34.028 --> 11:36.655
We're not having this conversation
if I'm not invested.

11:37.948 --> 11:39.158
Right?

11:40.701 --> 11:43.996
Here it is, Jack.
I was sitting on that sofa last night,

11:44.080 --> 11:46.499
and I'm wondering
if that's gonna be me down the line.

11:49.752 --> 11:51.587
Okay, come here.

11:53.589 --> 11:54.965
Come here.

11:58.094 --> 12:01.097
I really want us to happen.

12:03.099 --> 12:06.936
But we are both divorced people.
We got to work on our own shit, right?

12:07.061 --> 12:09.772
I'm working on mine,
you're working on yours.

12:10.815 --> 12:12.108
Right?

12:21.033 --> 12:23.369
I thought you'd be gone longer.

12:25.204 --> 12:26.789
What happened?

12:28.040 --> 12:29.792
Did he do something?

12:30.418 --> 12:32.128
No. No, he didn't.

12:33.754 --> 12:35.548
It's bad?

12:35.631 --> 12:37.133
Like really bad?

12:37.258 --> 12:40.052
Like he's got a secret family? No?

12:40.136 --> 12:43.389
He's under investigation? No?
He's on the take?

12:43.472 --> 12:45.558
<i>Did you</i> see <i>The Departed? It happens.</i>

12:45.641 --> 12:47.685
No, it's not him, okay?

12:48.644 --> 12:51.814
He overheard an argument I had with Kevin,

12:51.897 --> 12:55.526
and he thinks I have unresolved stuff.

12:58.404 --> 13:00.823
I've been waiting for this moment.

13:01.407 --> 13:02.741
Waiting? Really?

13:03.576 --> 13:08.831
When you skip sobriety steps,
it follows you like a ghost.

13:09.915 --> 13:11.917
You left rehab early.

13:12.001 --> 13:14.545
Now it's come back to haunt you with Frank.

13:17.590 --> 13:19.633
Anyone else want to share?

13:23.095 --> 13:26.223
- Hi, I'm Jackie and I'm an addict.
- Hi, Jackie.

13:27.683 --> 13:29.310
So...

13:31.645 --> 13:36.692
I met this guy and we had a fight, I guess.

13:36.775 --> 13:38.777
It wasn't really a fight.

13:38.861 --> 13:41.906
I don't... I don't really...
I don't know what it is, what it was.

13:41.989 --> 13:45.576
But... This sucks even more
than I thought it would.

13:48.037 --> 13:50.706
So I haven't really stuck with this program.

13:50.831 --> 13:52.666
I'm kind of doing it my way.

13:52.750 --> 13:54.460
And it was working.

13:56.837 --> 13:58.839
I don't know,
I guess it's not working anymore.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.969
And neither is this, so...

14:06.013 --> 14:07.306
I really...

14:07.389 --> 14:10.351
Does talking about yourself like this,
does it really help anybody?

14:10.434 --> 14:13.229
'Cause it really feels like bullshit to me.

14:13.729 --> 14:17.525
You know? And going up to people
that you pissed off and, you know...

14:19.193 --> 14:20.861
And then they can tell you,
"Oh, don't worry about it.

14:20.945 --> 14:23.405
"I don't even remember."
ltjust seems like bullshit.

14:23.489 --> 14:26.116
All of it seems like bullshit.
I'm clean and sober.

14:26.200 --> 14:28.994
I'm not using.
That should be enough, you know?

14:36.418 --> 14:38.921
Okay, great news, Mrs. Lee. X-ray is clear.

14:39.004 --> 14:42.007
I am sending you home
with some Robitussin.

14:42.758 --> 14:44.760
Let's see, grape or fruit punch?

14:45.886 --> 14:47.263
Grape.

14:48.097 --> 14:50.724
Are you sure you want to send her home?

14:50.808 --> 14:52.017
Yes, I am sure.

14:52.142 --> 14:53.811
What's the diagnosis here?

14:54.019 --> 14:57.398
Non-productive cough. Negative X-ray.
No fever, no chills.

14:57.690 --> 15:00.025
Dr. Cooper said to send her home with this.

15:00.985 --> 15:02.736
Have you been to Asia lately?

15:03.320 --> 15:05.114
Where do you live?

15:05.447 --> 15:06.782
Chinatown.

15:07.283 --> 15:09.201
TB has been coming in from overseas.

15:09.285 --> 15:12.246
Do a skin test, CT scan, put a mask on her,
then move her into isolation.

15:12.580 --> 15:15.457
Tuberculosis. Out of the box.

15:16.292 --> 15:18.752
Well, she works in a bank.
You might have stopped a plague.

15:24.383 --> 15:25.384
What?

15:25.467 --> 15:28.095
It's like watching a game
of ass-kiss Ping-Pong.

15:32.182 --> 15:34.184
Where are you taking her?

15:34.310 --> 15:37.479
Dr. Prentiss suggested a TB test
and isolation.

15:37.646 --> 15:38.939
I think it's a good idea.

15:39.648 --> 15:42.067
Why? Breath sounds were clear.

15:42.943 --> 15:44.445
No swollen glands.

15:44.528 --> 15:46.655
Does she have night sweats? Fatigue?
Weight loss?

15:46.739 --> 15:49.158
No, but he is chief of the ER.

15:50.743 --> 15:53.495
Carrie, you're always gonna have
some doctor hijacking your case,

15:53.579 --> 15:55.623
trying to prove what a big man he is.

16:01.670 --> 16:04.340
You got something to talk about,
we can talk about it.

16:05.090 --> 16:06.717
Not on the floor.

16:09.970 --> 16:12.014
Now, when I order tests,
I want them done, period.

16:12.097 --> 16:13.849
Even if the tests are unnecessary
and alarmist?

16:13.932 --> 16:15.476
Alarmist. That's a big word for you, huh?

16:15.643 --> 16:18.437
- My money's on Prentiss.
- Prentiss by a mile.

16:19.355 --> 16:20.648
How are you not on Coop's side?

16:20.731 --> 16:23.400
- Especially when you guys are...
- Fucking?

16:23.734 --> 16:25.527
Some people call it dating.

16:25.611 --> 16:29.406
Oh, yes. Nothing says romance
quite like a quickie in the supply closet.

16:30.366 --> 16:31.700
Dr. Roman!

16:33.035 --> 16:35.287
Early TB doesn't always present.

16:35.371 --> 16:36.955
Okay, fuck the diagnosis.

16:37.039 --> 16:39.083
Being chief of ER doesn't
mean you get to be an asshole.

16:42.503 --> 16:43.545
Breath sounds?

16:47.216 --> 16:48.384
Jesus.

16:49.134 --> 16:51.261
No breath sounds on the right now.

16:51.345 --> 16:53.806
- I don't get it. I don't know.
- Do something.

16:53.889 --> 16:55.516
- Do something now.
- Okay.

16:55.599 --> 16:56.975
Fuck.

16:57.059 --> 17:00.062
Prentiss said to test for TB,
but I don't think...

17:01.522 --> 17:03.565
She's your patient. What do you want to do?

17:07.027 --> 17:09.697
- All right, Zoey, get a doctor, please.
- No, stay. I got this.

17:12.282 --> 17:13.283
I don't think it's TB.

17:13.367 --> 17:16.662
I think it's a lung collapse,
spontaneous pneumothorax.

17:16.745 --> 17:18.831
Like that cop who was shot.

17:20.416 --> 17:21.792
Okay, Zoey, prep a chest tube.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.585
Stay with me, Mrs. Lee.

17:53.615 --> 17:54.867
Scalpel.

18:30.486 --> 18:32.362
That's the O2 rising.

18:35.866 --> 18:37.409
What's going on?

18:37.493 --> 18:39.119
Patient's stable.

18:39.203 --> 18:41.455
I feel like I'm gonna throw up. Here you go.

18:47.169 --> 18:48.921
Hey, Frank. It's Jackie.

18:49.004 --> 18:51.548
I know you're busy, but if you could
give me a call when you get a minute,

18:51.632 --> 18:53.717
that would be great, thanks.

18:54.384 --> 18:56.845
Hey, I got Akalitus' test results.

18:58.180 --> 19:00.349
- Holy shit!
- Explains a lot, huh?

19:02.017 --> 19:03.852
- Hey, Gloria.
- What's going on, Jackie?

19:07.815 --> 19:09.983
- What do you think you're doing?
- Gloria, just give us one second.

19:10.901 --> 19:11.985
It's your memory.

19:12.194 --> 19:13.445
And it's getting worse.

19:13.529 --> 19:16.114
And we were concerned,
so we ran some blood tests.

19:16.782 --> 19:21.703
So this was your idea?
This is you trying to help me?

19:21.995 --> 19:23.497
Can you just listen for one second?

19:23.580 --> 19:26.208
You listen! You stay the fuck out of my life!

19:26.291 --> 19:29.962
I have put my ass on the line
for you over and over.

19:30.045 --> 19:33.215
- And now you do this.
- Gloria, stop for one second, please?

19:33.382 --> 19:34.883
Will you listen?

19:34.967 --> 19:36.802
I think we can rule out Alzheimer's.

19:36.885 --> 19:39.263
Your ammonia levels are sky-high.

19:39.346 --> 19:42.349
I think the memory problems
are either liver toxicity

19:42.432 --> 19:44.142
or a side effect of medication.

19:44.226 --> 19:46.186
Are you on some new med?

19:50.732 --> 19:52.025
Depakote.

19:52.901 --> 19:54.486
I had a seizure a year ago.

19:54.570 --> 19:58.073
Short-term memory loss is a side effect
of Depakote.

19:58.240 --> 19:59.908
I bet your dosage is off.

20:00.075 --> 20:01.493
I can fix this, Gloria.

20:01.577 --> 20:05.706
- If there's anything I know, it's this stuff.
- Gloria, you are gonna get better.

20:09.585 --> 20:11.003
- Thank you.
- Okay.

20:11.086 --> 20:14.423
Oh, my God. Thank you.

20:17.050 --> 20:18.552
All right.

20:20.679 --> 20:22.514
Adult onset seizures? Jesus Christ.

20:22.598 --> 20:24.057
I couldn't say anything.

20:24.224 --> 20:27.728
Do you know how hard it is

20:28.103 --> 20:31.857
for a 52-year-old woman

20:33.191 --> 20:36.361
with a chronic illness to keep a job?
They already fired me once.

20:36.445 --> 20:37.946
You can't tell anybody about this.

20:38.822 --> 20:40.616
Boy, I wish you had come to us.

20:40.699 --> 20:43.619
You cannot imagine

20:43.702 --> 20:49.082
what it does carrying a burden
like this all by yourself.

20:59.676 --> 21:01.428
Whose office is this?

21:01.511 --> 21:02.971
I mean, you have a gift.

21:03.055 --> 21:05.265
Welcome, Dr. Prentiss.

21:05.349 --> 21:07.851
Your patient records are here.

21:08.977 --> 21:11.521
Insurance billing there.

21:12.022 --> 21:15.233
You can get your hands on anything
in under one minute.

21:16.151 --> 21:20.572
And your military commendations.

21:20.656 --> 21:22.115
Thank you for your service.

21:22.866 --> 21:24.534
And yours.

21:24.618 --> 21:27.454
You really... You really kicked some
paperwork ass in here.

21:27.663 --> 21:30.999
Wait. What's on this envelope?

21:31.083 --> 21:33.168
Oh, yeah, it's a Mad Lib.

21:33.251 --> 21:35.253
I made it for this kid with an eye infection.

21:35.337 --> 21:37.798
He discharged
before I could get him to do it.

21:37.881 --> 21:39.424
This one's not that good.

21:39.508 --> 21:41.593
I'll be the judge of that.

21:42.636 --> 21:44.304
Will you?

21:45.180 --> 21:46.264
Okay.

21:46.848 --> 21:49.184
- I love Mad Libs.
- Do you? Okay.

21:50.102 --> 21:51.186
Adverb.

21:53.855 --> 21:55.065
Gently.

22:00.195 --> 22:01.697
- Animal?
- Falcon.

22:05.158 --> 22:08.537
- N u m be r?
<i>-Deux.</i>

22:16.294 --> 22:17.629
Body part.

22:18.839 --> 22:21.299
Ear. No, wait.

22:21.383 --> 22:23.802
Earlobe. No, wait.

22:25.887 --> 22:27.556
Small of the back.

22:35.814 --> 22:37.065
Okay.

22:46.408 --> 22:48.577
Hey, Grace, honey, you busy?

22:48.994 --> 22:50.704
<i>Studying for a Lit test.</i>

22:50.912 --> 22:52.372
Did you call to yell at me again?

22:52.456 --> 22:55.292
No. Actually, honey, I called to apologize.

22:55.375 --> 22:57.544
You should. it was humiliating.

22:57.627 --> 22:58.837
<i>I know.</i>

22:59.588 --> 23:01.423
I'm sorry, sweetie.

23:02.299 --> 23:04.551
You know, we all make mistakes,

23:05.594 --> 23:08.430
and I'm trying to deal with stuff
just like you are,

23:08.513 --> 23:11.266
and I need to cut you some slack,
and I'm sorry.

23:12.893 --> 23:14.770
<i>Okay? Apology accepted?</i>

23:16.396 --> 23:18.023
<i>- Yes.
-All right.</i>

23:18.774 --> 23:20.567
Good, honey.

23:20.650 --> 23:25.238
Okay, back to the books, sweetie.
And good luck on the test, okay?

23:25.989 --> 23:27.157
Night.

23:33.789 --> 23:35.040
You Okay?

23:37.084 --> 23:39.628
I've got to clean up a mess I made.

23:43.423 --> 23:44.800
Good night.

23:47.886 --> 23:49.554
That was a pretty crazy day, right?

23:49.638 --> 23:52.182
Yeah, it was a nice catch
on that pneumothorax.

23:52.390 --> 23:53.892
Did your job. I was watching.

23:53.975 --> 23:57.646
Well, I am learning something
from Dr. Cooper.

23:58.605 --> 24:02.651
But keep watching 'cause I'm gonna get you
to give me a real compliment.

24:02.818 --> 24:04.236
And I will earn it.

24:05.112 --> 24:06.822
Have a good night.

24:11.660 --> 24:12.911
Where you going?

24:14.704 --> 24:16.581
That's okay. I'm going way uptown.

24:16.665 --> 24:19.417
Yeah, I'm sure you're not going
as far as I am.

24:19.501 --> 24:22.045
I'm not sure. Are we ready to share a cab?

24:22.129 --> 24:23.463
Hop in.

24:29.052 --> 24:31.012
<i>I'm here because</i> I...

24:34.599 --> 24:36.768
I'm not actually sure
how this is supposed to work.

24:36.852 --> 24:38.186
So...

24:40.522 --> 24:43.441
If you'll just bear with me for a second.

24:45.026 --> 24:46.069
L.-

24:47.529 --> 24:52.367
I want to say that I care about you.

24:54.536 --> 24:56.454
And I'm never not gonna care about you.

24:56.538 --> 24:58.748
I know I caused you a lot of pain.

24:59.374 --> 25:01.209
And...

25:03.253 --> 25:06.047
I've lied to you. I've lied to our girls.

25:07.591 --> 25:10.093
I've done other things
that I'm not particularly proud of.

25:10.260 --> 25:13.638
Is this the AA thing where you have
to say you're sorry?

25:13.722 --> 25:16.016
'Cause I've heard a lot of sorrys.

25:16.224 --> 25:18.476
I know, Kevin.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.604
I'm an addict.

25:20.687 --> 25:23.106
You know? I don't want to be.
I didn't ask to be.

25:23.773 --> 25:26.109
I am and I fucked up.

25:26.193 --> 25:29.654
And I didn't care how any of this
affected you or anybody else, really.

25:29.779 --> 25:33.617
I just needed to keep using.

25:34.492 --> 25:36.953
You know, that's awful and I'm so sorry.

25:38.788 --> 25:40.248
I'm so sorry, Kevin.

25:47.547 --> 25:50.550
I don't really know how this is supposed
to change anything.

25:51.259 --> 25:53.970
I... You know, I...

25:54.054 --> 25:56.223
Maybe it'll make you feel a little better,
I don't know.

25:56.681 --> 26:00.518
Maybe make me feel a little better.
Make our family feel a little better.

26:00.602 --> 26:02.270
And...

26:05.065 --> 26:07.901
I don't know, maybe that's the best
I can hope for at this point.

26:13.573 --> 26:15.784
It's okay if you want a drink.
Somebody should.

26:18.495 --> 26:20.747
Maybe later.

26:22.374 --> 26:24.376
For now I'm good.

26:35.595 --> 26:37.347
One more.

26:40.642 --> 26:42.143
It's okay.
