Excuse you, Alton Brown.

00:25.593 --> 00:26.860
Oh, I'm not Alton Brown.

00:26.860 --> 00:29.930
Yeah, you're way too old.
Move! Ugh!

00:30.964 --> 00:32.600
I missed her.
Now I'll never know

00:32.600 --> 00:35.035
if her choice of dress
was icy or dicey.

Oh, I'm sorry.
Let me make it up to you.

be my plus-one?

00:39.440 --> 00:40.908
Ahh!

00:40.908 --> 00:43.077
Of course, Selena probably
didn't choose her dress.

We idolize celebrities
for their style and fashion,

but the truth is,
everything from their jewelry

01:17.111 --> 01:18.912

is marketing,

weighing

04:12.953 --> 04:14.988
the artistic merits

04:18.426 --> 04:19.927
Money can't act!

04:19.927 --> 04:22.996
No, but it can make voters
act differently.

04:22.996 --> 04:24.298
And to influence them,

04:24.298 --> 04:26.767
studios and networks
throw boatloads of money

04:26.767 --> 04:28.101
into what
the industry calls

04:28.101 --> 04:29.937

have your fun.

04:40.180 --> 04:41.815
For Your Consideration
campaigns

04:41.815 --> 04:43.717

to see movies.

we're gonna feed 'em,

05:48.215 --> 05:49.583
you're gonna take pictures
with everybody,

05:49.583 --> 05:52.252
you're gonna hold the magazines,
take the pictures,

05:52.252 --> 05:54.054
and you're gonna win
the award.

05:54.054 --> 05:57.224
(laughter)

05:57.224 --> 06:00.561
I won that year.
(laughter)

06:00.561 --> 06:02.896
And all that advertising
costs money.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.231
To win an Oscar,

06:04.231 --> 06:07.100
studios may have to spend
up to $10 million.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.969
10 million--

06:08.969 --> 06:11.204
That's Kardashian
wedding money.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.440
I mean,
these things are nice,

06:12.440 --> 06:14.642
but not $10 million
nice.

06:14.642 --> 06:16.143
So, what's the point?

06:16.143 --> 06:17.611
You gotta spend money
to make money.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.647
Ahh!
Oh, Mark,
this is Pete Hammond,

06:19.647 --> 06:21.615
awards columnist

06:21.615 --> 06:23.083
Hi, Pete.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.085
Hey, be careful, Adam,
I'm in deep cover.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.153
Oh, shh.
Sorry.

06:26.153 --> 06:28.155
Look, it's all about
the bottom line.

06:28.155 --> 06:30.758
There are studies
that show a nomination itself

06:30.758 --> 06:33.461
can mean $20 million more
at the box office,

06:33.461 --> 06:36.296
and with a win,
it can be 35 million and up.

06:36.296 --> 06:38.466
Actually,
even a flop movie

06:38.466 --> 06:40.468
can make money with
a nomination.

06:40.468 --> 06:43.236
Getting nominated
is just good for business.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.605
And winning
a major award

06:44.605 --> 06:46.640
conveys something
even more important--

06:46.640 --> 06:49.176
prestige and power.

06:49.176 --> 06:53.113
No one was taking Netflix
seriously as a TV network.

06:53.113 --> 06:57.284
So we resolved...
to win us an Emmy.

06:57.284 --> 06:58.819
We went to the neighborhoods
of Emmy voters

06:58.819 --> 07:00.754
and we gave
their neighbors $50 each

07:00.754 --> 07:03.156
to put up Netflix
lawn signs.

07:03.156 --> 07:05.125
We sent out food trucks

07:05.125 --> 07:08.696
will free lunch
all around Los Angeles.

07:08.696 --> 07:12.466
We painted the town
with money.

07:12.466 --> 07:13.767
And that year,

07:13.767 --> 07:18.639
we won not only one Emmy,
we won three.

07:18.639 --> 07:20.874
So, I took the other two
and I melted them down

07:20.874 --> 07:23.310
and made them
into rings.

07:23.310 --> 07:26.379
Now, Netflix...
(knocking on counter)

07:26.379 --> 07:28.949
is a TV network.
(Mark) No!

07:28.949 --> 07:31.051
Awards matter.
Leo ate raw meat.

07:31.051 --> 07:32.553
He deserves to win!

07:32.553 --> 07:34.655
Well, quality can matter,
but really,

07:34.655 --> 07:36.389
you've got to campaign.

07:36.389 --> 07:37.858
Studios do all sorts
of things now

07:37.858 --> 07:39.560
to get attention from voters.

07:39.560 --> 07:42.029
They have concerts,
trips to Vegas.

07:42.029 --> 07:44.832
Nominees will even
come to your house now.

07:44.832 --> 07:47.735
Look, spending money doesn't
guarantee you're gonna win,

07:47.735 --> 07:50.738
but if you want to have
a chance, you'd better campaign.

07:50.738 --> 07:52.640
That's so disappointing.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.207
Sorry.
It's true.

07:54.207 --> 07:55.208
Oh, my gosh.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.476
Adam, please hide me.

07:56.476 --> 07:59.412
Here comes Anne Hathaway.
She's relentless.

07:59.412 --> 08:01.048
Sure.
Sorry.

08:01.048 --> 08:02.382
Come on, let's go,
let's go!

08:02.382 --> 08:04.718
Look, I want my show
to win an award, too,

08:04.718 --> 08:07.020
so I gotta play the game
like everybody else.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.156
That's why this year,
I'm giving every voter

08:09.156 --> 08:11.224
a tub of my custom hair gel
and a book

08:11.224 --> 08:13.761
of my favorite graphs,
called "Graphs"!

08:13.761 --> 08:14.895
You'll have fun with that.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.564
So what's the point?

08:16.564 --> 08:19.833
All the movies and TV shows that
I love are secretly horrible?

08:19.833 --> 08:21.234
Oh, no, the ones
that get nominated

08:21.234 --> 08:22.536
are still pretty good,
but when it comes

08:22.536 --> 08:24.404
to who wins,
money talks.

08:24.404 --> 08:27.007
I'd like to thank the Academy
for accepting me

08:27.007 --> 08:29.743
and the studio for always
putting my needs first.

08:29.743 --> 08:32.412
(announcer)
Coming up next, Adam ruins
everything you know

08:32.412 --> 08:34.915
about movie ratings
and we drench you

08:34.915 --> 08:37.718
in PG-13 violence,
right after this.

08:37.718 --> 08:39.119
(money)
Thank you, everyone!

08:42.089 --> 08:43.523

08:43.523 --> 08:46.960
I haven't had that much fun
since the last NPR pledge drive.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.228
I love interruptions.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.630
Your version of "adulting"
is weird.

08:49.630 --> 08:50.631
(phone vibrating)

08:50.631 --> 08:52.299
Hold up!
Text alert.

09:01.074 --> 09:03.110
Of course movie ratings
matter, Adam.

09:03.110 --> 09:05.646
Before last week, my sweet
little 16-year-old brain

09:05.646 --> 09:06.914
couldn't handle
such filth,

09:06.914 --> 09:09.817
but now that I'm a jaded
and mature 17,

09:09.817 --> 09:11.652
I'm ready to see
that corpse get blended.

09:11.652 --> 09:14.287
Sorry, Mark, but movie ratings
are an outdated

09:14.287 --> 09:16.323
and unnecessary
form of censorship

09:16.323 --> 09:18.125
that makes no sense.

09:18.125 --> 09:19.960
It all goes back
to the uptight

09:19.960 --> 09:22.996
and Prohibition-y
1920s.

09:22.996 --> 09:25.999
♪♪

09:25.999 --> 09:28.969
Movies back then were starting
to get a little racy.

09:28.969 --> 09:30.403
(wolf whistle)

09:30.403 --> 09:32.572
So the government threatened
to censor the movie industry

09:32.572 --> 09:34.007
until a man named
William Hays

09:34.007 --> 09:36.343
stepped in and created
the Hays Code.

09:36.343 --> 09:38.411
No need to censor us.

09:38.411 --> 09:42.282
The movie industry
shall censor ourselves.

09:42.282 --> 09:47.320
The following perversions are
hereby banned in Hollywood.

09:47.320 --> 09:51.158
Interracial dating.
Banned!

09:51.158 --> 09:55.028
Making fun of clergy.
Banned!

09:55.028 --> 09:57.530
White slavery, banned!

09:57.530 --> 09:59.599
Black slavery
is A-okay, though.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.468
Switch 'em out,
boys!

10:04.304 --> 10:06.807
That's crazy.

10:06.807 --> 10:07.875
Where am I?

10:07.875 --> 10:09.542
(bell ringing,
indistinct voice on PA)

10:09.542 --> 10:10.944
The Hays Code
eventually evolved

10:10.944 --> 10:13.180
into the ratings system
we have today.

10:13.180 --> 10:15.482
And while today's system
is a lot less racist,

10:15.482 --> 10:17.885
it is just as weird
and arbitrary.

10:17.885 --> 10:19.820
No way.
I'm sure the people

10:19.820 --> 10:23.023
who rate movies
are intelligent, objective...

10:23.023 --> 10:24.658
Who are they,
B-T-dubs?

10:24.658 --> 10:26.559
That's the spooky part.

10:26.559 --> 10:28.461
No one knows.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.563
The identities of the ratings
board members

10:30.563 --> 10:32.866
are kept secret.
All we know is that

10:32.866 --> 10:34.802
they're parents who live
in Los Angeles.

10:34.802 --> 10:38.471
(woman, distorted)
I don't agree with the Smurfs'
polygamous lifestyle.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.173
PG.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.675
(slurping)

10:41.675 --> 10:43.076
Okay, I gotta run.

10:43.076 --> 10:46.079
Skylar has soccer and the 101
is backed up my ass today.

10:46.079 --> 10:47.314
What we do know is,

10:47.314 --> 10:49.416
the ratings they give
are totally irrational.

10:51.084 --> 10:54.021
Nah, boo, movie ratings
must mean something.

10:54.021 --> 10:55.655
Okay, what are you excited
to see

10:55.655 --> 10:58.258
in your first R-rated movie
that you can't in PG-13?

10:58.258 --> 11:01.428
(Mark)
Sweet, sweet violence,
and a lot of it.

11:01.428 --> 11:03.997
Wrong. PG-13 movies
have been found

11:03.997 --> 11:06.900
to contain more gun violence
than R-rated movies.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.368
(stabbing)
Oh!

11:08.368 --> 11:12.005
In fact, gun violence
in PG-13 movies has doubled--

11:12.005 --> 11:13.073
(gunshot)
Unh!

11:13.073 --> 11:14.507
No.

11:14.507 --> 11:17.110
Tripled, since 1985.

11:17.110 --> 11:20.680
Thanks, MPAA,
you filthy animals.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.615
(man)
And, cut!
(yawning)

11:22.615 --> 11:24.551
Tripled?
That's sick!

11:24.551 --> 11:28.621
Well, then PG-13 movies
must also have tons of...

11:28.621 --> 11:29.622
(whispering)
...sex.

11:29.622 --> 11:31.024
(chuckling)
You wish.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.525
For a group
that's totally chill

11:32.525 --> 11:34.294
with hyper-violent
blood symphonies,

11:34.294 --> 11:37.564
the MPAA is weirdly
prudish about sex.

11:37.564 --> 11:40.133
They gave a PG-13 to
"The Dark Knight,"

11:40.133 --> 11:42.035
a movie where dozens
are brutally murdered,

11:42.035 --> 11:43.436
a hospital explodes

11:43.436 --> 11:45.572
and a bomb is planted
in a dude's belly.

11:45.572 --> 11:50.277
(beeping, explosion)

11:50.277 --> 11:52.712
And an R to
"Shakespeare in Love,"

11:52.712 --> 11:54.614
an Oscar-winning
literary dramedy

11:54.614 --> 11:56.483
with some mild
hanky-panky.

11:56.483 --> 11:58.786
(fabric tearing)
Oh, careful, Will!

11:58.786 --> 12:01.454
One more button
and we'll hit NC-17.

12:01.454 --> 12:03.723
The MPAA straight-up
loves violence

12:03.723 --> 12:05.993
and hates sex
and no one know why.

12:05.993 --> 12:07.327
Eh, I'm a teen.

12:07.327 --> 12:08.829
I'll take whatever nudity
I can get.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.163
Get out of here.
Hey, wait!

12:10.163 --> 12:11.999
(gasping)
What about swearing?

12:11.999 --> 12:13.333
That always
gets an R

12:13.333 --> 12:15.002
because swearing rules.
Nope.

12:15.002 --> 12:17.637
The MPAA often gives
different ratings

12:17.637 --> 12:19.739
to the very same word.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.909
So this...
(bleep) you!

12:21.909 --> 12:24.011
...gets you a PG-13,
while this...

12:24.011 --> 12:25.578
I'd like to (bleep) you.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.680
...gets you an R.
And this...

12:27.680 --> 12:29.516
I'd like to (bleep) you.

12:29.516 --> 12:30.984
...gets you an NC-17,

12:30.984 --> 12:33.854
because they also
routinely rate LGBT sex

12:33.854 --> 12:36.023
as more objectionable
than straight sex.

12:36.023 --> 12:37.457
(Mark gasping)
No!

12:37.457 --> 12:38.859
Not in Macklemore's
America.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.260
How do they justify this?

12:40.260 --> 12:42.029
They don't.
Joan Graves, the chair

12:42.029 --> 12:44.031
of the MPAA Ratings Board
has said...

12:47.500 --> 12:49.369
Which means they can use
whatever weird logic

12:49.369 --> 12:51.038
or prejudice they want.

12:51.038 --> 12:54.307
It's insane that
this is the system.

12:54.307 --> 12:56.643
Look, in principle,
it's important

12:56.643 --> 12:58.378
to know what kids
are watching.

12:58.378 --> 12:59.546
But the system
we currently have

12:59.546 --> 13:01.681
is outdated,
arbitrary,

13:01.681 --> 13:04.885
kinda homophobic,
and helps no one.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.019
Movie ratings
are as pointless

13:06.019 --> 13:07.720
as trying to stop
the corpse blender.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.522
Its power
is from hell!
Ugh!

13:09.522 --> 13:12.125
Spoiler alert!
I was gonna see that!

13:13.560 --> 13:15.228
Fine. I guess
I'll just go home

13:15.228 --> 13:17.364
and make myself a mocktail
and do something vintage,

13:17.364 --> 13:19.900
like watch reality shows
on cable.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.401
Oh, I love
reality shows.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.170
You do strike me
as a Tim Gunn fan.

13:23.170 --> 13:25.638
Oh, no, I mean, because
everything in them is fake.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.041
Here, I'll show you!
Ahh!

13:28.041 --> 13:31.244
(announcer)
Next on "The Real Ruiners
of L.A."

13:31.244 --> 13:33.146
Everything in reality shows

Hey!
Not in my section!

♪♪

13:47.895 --> 13:50.030
I asked Adam to brunch
so I can confront him

13:50.030 --> 13:51.865
about ruining things
for me.

13:51.865 --> 13:55.035
If you ain't El Niño,
don't rain on my parade.

13:55.035 --> 13:56.569
What Mark needs
to realize is,

13:56.569 --> 13:58.771
I didn't come here
to make friends.

13:58.771 --> 14:00.707
I came here for brunch.

14:02.742 --> 14:03.776
Hi, you look amazing.

14:03.776 --> 14:06.279
Oh, my God,
that shirt is flawless.

14:06.279 --> 14:08.781
Thank you.
I keep it 100.

14:08.781 --> 14:10.017
(waitress)
Hi.

14:10.017 --> 14:13.053
I'm Ariana.
I'll be your server.

14:15.555 --> 14:17.090
All right, I can tell
you guys are drama,

14:17.090 --> 14:19.126
so you better not
mess up my brunch hunch,

14:19.126 --> 14:20.393
or Ariana's gonna
have to throw down.

14:20.393 --> 14:22.795
Ugh!
Okay, whatever.

14:22.795 --> 14:25.132
I brought you here
to let you know

14:25.132 --> 14:27.234
when you ruin things
that I love,

14:27.234 --> 14:30.037
you're attacking me
and that's not okay.

14:30.037 --> 14:32.906
Okay, I hear you
so hard,

14:32.906 --> 14:34.407
but what
you need to understand

14:34.407 --> 14:36.809
is that everything
in reality shows is hella fake

14:36.809 --> 14:39.379
and I'm gonna tell you about it
'cause I keep it real.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.248
Okay, well,
how is this for real?

14:41.248 --> 14:43.716
You're a social
parasite, Adam.

15:00.968 --> 15:03.336
Everybody take five.
Whew.

15:03.336 --> 15:04.571
Wait,
what just happened?

15:04.571 --> 15:06.239
I can't believe I said
all those things.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.240
Oh, yeah, you know,

15:07.240 --> 15:10.177
I go places exclusively
to make friends.

15:10.177 --> 15:11.344
I'm not even on this show.

15:11.344 --> 15:12.679
I'm on
"Vanderpump Rules."

15:13.746 --> 15:16.016
Watch what happens.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.487
What's going on?
Let me explain.

15:20.487 --> 15:22.189
Mark,
this is Mike Kopplin,

15:22.189 --> 15:24.024
a veteran reality show
head writer

15:24.024 --> 15:25.993
and part of
my Hollywood entourage.

15:25.993 --> 15:28.695
Well, technically,
it's supervising story producer,

15:28.695 --> 15:30.197
and, uh,
you're more of a Turtle.

15:30.197 --> 15:31.431
♪ Oh, yeah

15:31.431 --> 15:32.532
Mike, would you just
tell him about

15:32.532 --> 15:33.766
what you guys
are doing here?

15:33.766 --> 15:35.035
Well, Mark,
most people know

15:35.035 --> 15:36.970
that reality shows bend
the truth,

15:36.970 --> 15:38.305
but they don't understand
how staged

15:38.305 --> 15:39.606
they really are.

15:39.606 --> 15:42.875
These are our story producers,
also known as writers.

15:42.875 --> 15:45.712
Okay, so for the "Vanderpump"
cross-promotion,

15:45.712 --> 15:48.715
how about we have Adam confront
Mark about ruining things?

15:48.715 --> 15:50.617
No, let's have Mark
confront Adam,

15:50.617 --> 15:51.818
so we need an insult.

15:51.818 --> 15:52.819
Let's hear
some pitches.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.156
All right, how about,
you look like

15:56.156 --> 15:58.025
a less hot
Rick Moranis?

15:58.025 --> 15:59.392
You're like if "thirsty"
were a person.

15:59.392 --> 16:02.695
You look like a Pidgeotto
who went to grad school.

16:02.695 --> 16:04.897
You dress like
a lonely meteorologist.

16:04.897 --> 16:07.334
(thunder rumbling)
Let's, uh...

16:07.334 --> 16:09.236
Let's go with Rick Moranis.
It's got a nice cadence.

16:09.236 --> 16:11.671
Cool, cool.
I'll hand out scripts.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.073
Reality shows have scripts?

16:13.073 --> 16:14.407
Oh, yeah.
Some reality shows

16:14.407 --> 16:16.576
are so scripted,
they've actually been unionized

16:16.576 --> 16:18.578
by the Writer's Guild
of America.

16:18.578 --> 16:19.912
Now, every show
is different,

16:19.912 --> 16:20.913
but they all start
with a basic

16:20.913 --> 16:22.982
level of planning,
from establishing

16:22.982 --> 16:26.686
talking points beforehand
to actually doing reshoots.

16:26.686 --> 16:27.987
Like on "Bridezillas,"
for instance,

16:27.987 --> 16:30.057
we would go out and reshoot
the bride if she was too nice.

16:30.057 --> 16:32.925
We'd have her go crazy and yell
and scream and carry on.

16:32.925 --> 16:36.096
Now, celebrity shows,
they can be very scripted.

16:36.096 --> 16:37.730
But Kim, Kendall,

16:37.730 --> 16:39.899
and to a lesser extent,
Scott Disick,

16:39.899 --> 16:41.768
are inviting us
into their lives.

16:41.768 --> 16:43.370
Well, think about it
for a second.

16:43.370 --> 16:46.073
If a celebrity's entire
livelihood is their image,

16:46.073 --> 16:47.674
you really think they're gonna
let cameras into their home

16:47.674 --> 16:49.442
without some kind
of a plan?

16:49.442 --> 16:50.610
And TV shows
are very expensive

16:50.610 --> 16:52.112
to make, so we have to
prove to the network

16:52.112 --> 16:53.680
before the shoot day that
we're gonna get

16:53.680 --> 16:55.115
useable footage,
because a perfect

16:55.115 --> 16:57.850
three-act story just doesn't
fall into our laps.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.252
That makes sense.

16:59.252 --> 17:02.021
So we need to get back to
our insult brainstorm session.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.623
Oh, sorry.
Thanks, Mike.

17:03.623 --> 17:04.891
(snapping fingers)

17:04.891 --> 17:06.126
Can I see the script?

17:06.126 --> 17:07.960
Even if some of
the lines are written,

17:07.960 --> 17:10.797
I know I never called you
a social parasite.

17:10.797 --> 17:12.699
Oh, no, that was just
a Frankenbite.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.134
Mark, this is Kent Kincannon,

17:14.134 --> 17:15.968
an editor on our show

17:15.968 --> 17:17.404
and part of
my Hollywood entourage.

17:17.404 --> 17:19.072
Stop telling people
that, Adam.

17:19.072 --> 17:21.474
Yeah, so a Frankenbite
is when editors combine

17:21.474 --> 17:24.144
and trim sentences
to make them more concise.

17:24.144 --> 17:25.612
When you hear somebody
say something

17:25.612 --> 17:28.248
and it's off-screen,
it's probably a Frankenbite.

17:28.248 --> 17:29.816
You can even
use Frankenbites

17:29.816 --> 17:32.085
to make people say things
they didn't actually say.

17:32.085 --> 17:34.087
Like in this case,
we can take this clip.

17:34.087 --> 17:35.488
You're a social media app.

17:35.488 --> 17:36.823
You're a traffic app.

17:36.823 --> 17:38.758
You're a Japanese cat app.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.160
And combine it
with this clip here.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.262
(Adam)
So it's called
amoebic dysentery.

17:42.262 --> 17:43.796
I'm eating.

17:43.796 --> 17:46.099
Please don't talk about
your food parasite, Adam.

17:46.099 --> 17:48.768
And, if we edit
that audio together

17:48.768 --> 17:50.837
and use different video
to hide the edit,

17:50.837 --> 17:53.240
we'll get...
You're a social parasite, Adam.

17:53.240 --> 17:56.075
(gasping)
I feel so lied to.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.410
How deep
does this go?

17:57.410 --> 18:00.079
Does this mean all my fave
reality shows are fake?

18:00.079 --> 18:02.282
To some extent, yes.

18:02.282 --> 18:04.251
The people on house-hunting
shows have already bought

18:04.251 --> 18:06.353
one of the houses and just
removed all the furniture

18:06.353 --> 18:07.620
to make it look vacant.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.122
Food competition shows

18:09.122 --> 18:11.358
let contestants re-cook
fresh plates of food.

18:11.358 --> 18:14.026
The Alaskan bush people
actually live in Seattle.

18:14.026 --> 18:15.928
And the producers
on "The Bachelor" plan

18:15.928 --> 18:17.797
all the dates and tell
the bachelor

18:17.797 --> 18:19.699
who to send home when.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.934
Mark, reality shows
want you to believe

18:21.934 --> 18:24.036
that they're real life,
but the truth is,

18:24.036 --> 18:27.039
they're as fake
as everything else on TV.

18:27.039 --> 18:28.208
Oh.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.210
You are more evil than
the corpse blender.

18:30.210 --> 18:31.678
R-rated movies are fake.

18:31.678 --> 18:33.213
Award shows are fake.

18:33.213 --> 18:34.447
Reality TV is fake.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.048
Everything is fake
and the only thing

18:36.048 --> 18:38.218
on the planet that's real
is your show.

18:38.218 --> 18:41.288
Watch it on truTV.
All praise Adam!

18:41.288 --> 18:43.623
Oh, no, even my show
isn't what it seems.

18:43.623 --> 18:46.326
Let me explain.
(tearing)

18:46.326 --> 18:49.229
How many weaves
do you have?

18:49.229 --> 18:51.063
(whistling)

18:52.632 --> 18:56.336
(indistinct chatter)

18:56.336 --> 18:57.804
Nothing is real.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.972
Everything I believed in
is a lie.

18:59.972 --> 19:03.376
Mark, don't be so dramatic.
It's okay.

19:03.376 --> 19:05.645
Mark is gone.
I am Cain.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.181
Tell Mark that, yeah,
Hollywood is an illusion,

19:08.181 --> 19:10.650
but that's all right.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.419
Mark is too sad
to listen.

19:12.419 --> 19:13.553
Maybe Mark would listen

19:13.553 --> 19:17.324
to Ariana Madix from
"Vanderpump Rules"?

19:17.324 --> 19:19.326
Hey, Mark.
Adam's right.

19:19.326 --> 19:21.494
A lot of Hollywood
is an illusion.

19:21.494 --> 19:22.695
But as long
as they're honest

19:22.695 --> 19:25.698
about the extent of that
illusion, it's okay.

19:25.698 --> 19:27.700
"Vanderpump Rules"
is actually really real.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.068
We're all really friends,

19:29.068 --> 19:30.737
we all get
in tons of fights,

19:30.737 --> 19:32.772
and I actually do work
at the restaurant.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.341
But, that tough
conversation

19:34.341 --> 19:35.775
I have to have
with my boyfriend,

19:35.775 --> 19:37.844
I know where it's gonna
take place, 'cause that table

19:37.844 --> 19:40.380
is surrounded by cameras
and lights.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.114
Much like a lot
of Hollywood,

19:42.114 --> 19:44.751
it's real
and it's produced.

19:44.751 --> 19:47.687
But that's okay, as long
as you know the difference.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.589
My show is
the same way.

19:49.589 --> 19:51.691
I mean, yeah, I'm a know-it-all
in real life, too,

19:51.691 --> 19:54.026
but there's no way
one person could learn

19:54.026 --> 19:56.229
all of these facts
all by themselves.

19:56.229 --> 19:59.366
That's why I have the help
of my writers and researchers.

19:59.366 --> 20:00.367
Heck,
half the time,

20:00.367 --> 20:02.702
I'm just reading lines
they wrote.

20:02.702 --> 20:05.137
"I'm dumb, Travis is great."
Come on, man.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.708
Look, the point is,
there's nothing wrong

20:08.708 --> 20:10.209
with a little
Hollywood magic,

20:10.209 --> 20:12.312
as long as everyone knows
it's a magic trick.

20:12.312 --> 20:13.613
And I hope that
by being up-front

20:13.613 --> 20:14.881
about how we make
our show,

20:14.881 --> 20:16.716
we've helped generate
a little bit of trust.

20:16.716 --> 20:19.218
Wow.
That's really cool.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.721
I always wondered how shows
like this got made.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.723
It's actually kind of
more fun this way.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.124
See,
that's the spirit!

20:25.124 --> 20:26.959
Well, I gotta go tend bar
for some rich idiots.

20:26.959 --> 20:27.960
Bye, guys.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.396
Bye, Ariana, thanks.
Bye.

20:30.897 --> 20:33.500
I'm gonna go home and watch
"Bachelor in Paradise"

20:33.500 --> 20:34.967
and try to guess how
the producers

20:34.967 --> 20:36.736
got him to say
all that dumb stuff.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.005
There you go.
Do you want to come?

20:39.005 --> 20:40.440
Oh, yeah, of course.

20:40.440 --> 20:42.609
I mean, if you don't think
I'd bug you too much.

20:42.609 --> 20:44.944
No, I learned
a lot today.

20:44.944 --> 20:47.780
You know, I'd consider
the two of us true friends.

20:47.780 --> 20:51.284
♪♪

20:51.284 --> 20:52.419
(man)
And cut!

20:52.419 --> 20:53.853
That was awesome.
Great job, Adam.

20:53.853 --> 20:55.288
Thanks, Tim.
Thank you.

20:58.358 --> 21:00.259
Oh, hey, Edwin.
Man, great work.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.428
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you too, man.

21:01.428 --> 21:03.162
Killin' it.

21:05.365 --> 21:06.699
Yo, what time
is lunch?

21:06.699 --> 21:07.967
(whistling)
