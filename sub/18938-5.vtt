Kate: Previously on
"Workin' Moms":

00:07.213 --> 00:08.672
- Are you dismissing me?

00:08.672 --> 00:10.505
- I just think it would be
better for our relationship,

00:10.505 --> 00:13.588
you know, if maybe you didn't
watch Charlie anymore.

00:13.588 --> 00:15.463
- I think I might just have
the teensiest

00:15.463 --> 00:17.130
little drop of postpartum.

00:17.130 --> 00:19.130
Mean Nanny: I'm sorry,
but what part of "stand up"

00:19.130 --> 00:20.963
didn't you understand, Alice?
- You're hired.

00:20.963 --> 00:22.880
I'm gonna go ahead and write
you a prescription.

00:22.880 --> 00:25.463
- Let's do this.
(People screaming)

00:25.463 --> 00:28.588
Rosie: Kate, it's your mum,
she was bit by your dog.

00:28.588 --> 00:30.172
- He's a biter now,

00:30.172 --> 00:31.838
and I don't think there's any
coming back from that.

00:34.172 --> 00:36.047
- (Zoe cries)

00:36.047 --> 00:38.005
Art: You're doing really,
really good Jenny.

00:38.005 --> 00:40.047
- I thought you said
they'd like this.

00:40.047 --> 00:41.297
Art: Oh she will, soon.

00:41.297 --> 00:42.797
Frankie: Well, I gotta hand
it to you, Art.

00:42.797 --> 00:45.463
Man, these things are legit.
I just took a leak,

00:45.463 --> 00:48.922
and I felt Rhoda release
her bladder... in response.

00:48.922 --> 00:51.797
We were one!
Connected, it was awesome!

00:51.797 --> 00:54.588
- This is not natural! Sorry!

00:54.588 --> 00:56.380
- Maybe we should look away.

00:56.380 --> 00:58.505
- I don't think I can.
- Hmm.

00:58.505 --> 01:00.963
- I'm sensing you're
experiencing...

01:00.963 --> 01:03.338
a disconnect with your baby.

01:03.338 --> 01:06.130
You see, I'm dialed
into her frequency,

01:06.130 --> 01:09.380
while your mothering instincts
have become a little...

01:09.380 --> 01:11.630
hm, clouded by the modern--

01:11.630 --> 01:13.630
- No, no, just shut up, Art!

01:13.630 --> 01:16.422
- Uh, Art, I think
it would be best

01:16.422 --> 01:19.422
if you collected your silks,
and-and go.

01:19.422 --> 01:20.963
(Babies coo)

01:27.047 --> 01:28.713
- You know, I'm available
for home visits.

01:28.713 --> 01:30.838
All: Get outta here!
Just go, leave. Go!

01:30.838 --> 01:33.005
- I-I apologize, everyone.

01:33.005 --> 01:35.005
His website looked
very impressive.

01:35.005 --> 01:37.422
- Hey, who doesn't love
an older male mothering expert.

01:37.422 --> 01:40.088
Right? You okay, Jenny?
- (Sighs)

01:41.297 --> 01:43.755
Maybe I'm not connected
to Zoe.

01:43.755 --> 01:45.713
- Hey, you're great, seriously.

01:45.713 --> 01:47.588
Nobody says that we have
to be connected

01:47.588 --> 01:49.380
to our kids all the time.

01:49.380 --> 01:51.255
- Yeah, like Charlie,
I love him to death,

01:51.255 --> 01:54.005
he's my boy, but sometimes
I wish he was...

01:54.005 --> 01:56.713
like, on that show
"The Leftovers," you know?

01:56.713 --> 01:58.588
Just taken right out
of the back of my car,

01:58.588 --> 02:00.297
and then I get home
and I'm like,

02:00.297 --> 02:02.797
I know I went to the grocery
store, but where's my son?

02:02.797 --> 02:05.422
and then I'm free!

02:05.422 --> 02:09.338
- Ladies, the maternal bond
comes in many shapes and sizes.

02:09.338 --> 02:13.088
Let's try to focus on something
we can all agree on,

02:13.088 --> 02:15.213
that silk man was awful.
- Terrible.

02:15.213 --> 02:16.963

Your son bit a child.

has a couple tiny teeth,

03:32.338 --> 03:34.797

baby survived?

an easy thing for you,

03:58.838 --> 04:01.588

the choice.

04:01.588 --> 04:04.172
I will not be back
in that house

04:04.172 --> 04:07.047
with that animal anymore.
- Mom, I'm just gonna say it,

04:07.047 --> 04:09.422
the timing of all this
feels very convenient.

04:09.422 --> 04:11.672
- I don't know what you mean.

04:11.672 --> 04:14.255

you I want a new nanny,

04:14.255 --> 04:16.338

Yeah, Mom, I'm coming

explode in the kiln...

05:24.505 --> 05:26.463
- Shh, it's okay.

05:28.130 --> 05:29.797
- So the thing about
probiotics from yogurt

05:29.797 --> 05:31.880
is that it puts you more
in tune with animals.

05:31.880 --> 05:34.672
That's why I can communicate
with my cat.

05:34.672 --> 05:36.422
- So when did you start
liking

05:36.422 --> 05:38.005
all this health food... crap?

yogurt will make my skin glow.

- Mean Nanny?

we call you. Mean Nanny.

I kinda like it.

05:50.797 --> 05:53.338
I've never had anything
homemade!

05:53.338 --> 05:54.922
- That's not true at all.

05:54.922 --> 05:58.088
- And don't forget, it'll make
your hair super shiny, mini me!

06:00.672 --> 06:03.672
Can I make you an heirloom
cucumber salad, Anne?

06:03.672 --> 06:04.672
- Nope, I'm good.

That milk smells like despair,
by the way.

06:10.672 --> 06:12.672

Uh, confused?

06:27.297 --> 06:29.297

06:29.297 --> 06:31.463
- No, Lionel,
it's our little thing,

06:31.463 --> 06:33.088
I put one on his laptop
every day,

06:33.088 --> 06:34.630
and he puts one on my door.

06:34.630 --> 06:36.588
- Oh, what was yours
this morning?

06:36.588 --> 06:38.422

- Oh, that's brave.

06:38.422 --> 06:41.213

cheese sticks?

06:41.213 --> 06:42.672

06:46.422 --> 06:49.630

dairy is the smoothest.

06:49.630 --> 06:51.672
- Hmm.

06:51.672 --> 06:53.963
- So uh, how are you doing,

06:53.963 --> 06:55.880
now that you've been off
of meds for a few weeks?

06:55.880 --> 06:57.963
- A-okay.

06:57.963 --> 07:00.172
Yeah, I'm ready to creep
back on 'em.

07:00.172 --> 07:02.047
Don't wanna let those bats
back out of the cave.

07:02.047 --> 07:03.588

that we take

07:03.588 --> 07:04.963
an alternative approach.

07:04.963 --> 07:07.088
How's everything else?
How's work?

07:07.088 --> 07:08.422
- Yeah, good actually, yeah.

07:08.422 --> 07:10.588
I've been feeling a lot
more present at work.

07:10.588 --> 07:13.338
Ooh, and I picked up a hobby,
as per your suggestion.

07:13.338 --> 07:16.130
Pottery master!
Taking requests.

07:16.130 --> 07:17.755

07:17.755 --> 07:20.005
Such amazing progress
to celebrate,

07:20.005 --> 07:21.922

- Yeah...

07:21.922 --> 07:24.630
Yeah, it's just...

07:24.630 --> 07:26.713
I mean, things are still
weird with Giselle.

07:26.713 --> 07:28.213
- Mhmm...
- Right,

07:28.213 --> 07:30.005
she's always checking on me,

07:30.005 --> 07:31.922
pushing me to take care
of myself,

07:31.922 --> 07:34.213
and then pulling away at
the same time, it's like...

07:34.213 --> 07:36.380
it's like she's in one of those
revolving door thingies,

07:36.380 --> 07:38.172
you know, spinning,
and spinning and spinning,

07:38.172 --> 07:41.130
but she just-she won't let me
in, do you know what I mean?

07:41.130 --> 07:42.922
- Yeah, this has been
a very big adjustment

07:42.922 --> 07:44.713
for Giselle as well.

07:44.713 --> 07:47.255
I think it might take
a little time.

07:47.255 --> 07:49.422
When's the last time that
you guys had some fun together?

07:49.422 --> 07:51.713
- Oh man, Anne, I don't know!

07:51.713 --> 07:55.088

level fun, you know?

07:55.088 --> 07:58.755
There is a shot named after us
at our local bar.

07:58.755 --> 08:00.338
Okay, I'm not gonna tell you
the name of it,

08:00.338 --> 08:02.463
because Giselle thinks
it's racist,

08:02.463 --> 08:04.297
but it's a good one.

08:04.297 --> 08:06.588
Anyway, super fun,
that's what we were!

expect to be

08:10.380 --> 08:12.963
But you know,
there's other things.

- Yeah. No, you're right,
you're right.

08:15.922 --> 08:18.755
It's just um...

08:18.755 --> 08:22.297
I'd think better with another
one of those cheese strings.

it's my last one.

08:27.380 --> 08:29.588

it's just I have postpartum
depression.

09:43.838 --> 09:45.463
- What? What does that
even mean?

20:09.838 --> 20:11.255
- How's he adjusting?

20:11.255 --> 20:13.505
You guys look like two
peas in a pod.

20:13.505 --> 20:16.047
- Um...
- Oh my God!

20:16.047 --> 20:17.672
Rosie, are you okay?

20:17.672 --> 20:19.922
- Well, Olly actually
bit me yesterday.

20:19.922 --> 20:21.922
On the face,
it was pretty bad.

20:21.922 --> 20:25.672
Um, it was like
he wanted to eat me.

20:25.672 --> 20:28.338
- I am so sorry!
Is that blood?

20:28.588 --> 20:30.922
- It was my fault.

20:30.922 --> 20:33.172
- Did you have him... put down?

20:35.172 --> 20:36.422
- Of course not!

20:36.422 --> 20:39.172
Why would I put him down
just because he bit me?

20:39.172 --> 20:42.297
That's a horrible thing.
But did you um,

20:42.297 --> 20:45.422
maybe feed him a whole
family of hot dogs, or...

20:45.422 --> 20:47.755
there was an incident
in my dad's Astrovan,

20:47.755 --> 20:49.713
and it turns out
it's pretty expensive

20:49.713 --> 20:51.797
to get it pressure washed.
On the inside.

20:51.797 --> 20:56.130
- Of course I will cover that.
- Thank you.

20:56.130 --> 20:58.922
- I'm glad he's alive,
and it was a double dog.

21:01.880 --> 21:03.130
And a milkshake.
- Yeah...

21:06.255 --> 21:07.880
- A couple fries.
