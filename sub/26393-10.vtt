WEBVTT

00:07.920 --> 00:08.921
Whoo!All right, man,

00:08.965 --> 00:10.227
make that one.

00:10.271 --> 00:12.360
Easy. What's the score again?

00:12.403 --> 00:16.190
You have letters H-O-R-S,
and I have none.

00:19.976 --> 00:21.151
All right.

00:21.195 --> 00:23.066
I'm-a head home.
You done, too?

00:23.110 --> 00:24.676
No, I'm-a hang around
for a little bit.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.374
All right. Hit me up
for one last shot.

00:26.417 --> 00:27.418
Splash time.

00:35.470 --> 00:36.819
Hey, what's up, little man?

00:36.862 --> 00:38.081
Yo, what's up?

00:38.125 --> 00:39.213
Want to shoot around?

00:39.256 --> 00:40.257
Nah, man.

00:40.301 --> 00:42.259
But I do want those shoes.

00:44.218 --> 00:46.829
[chuckles]: Okay, well,
put them on your Christmas list,

00:46.872 --> 00:49.440
and maybe Santa Claus
will you bring you some.

00:50.746 --> 00:52.748
I don't believe
in no Santa.

00:52.791 --> 00:55.577
But I do believe you're
gonna give me those shoes.

00:59.276 --> 01:01.104
I'm not giving
you my shoes.

01:01.148 --> 01:04.194
Plus, I outweigh you
by a hundred pounds.

01:07.763 --> 01:10.461
Well, you're a little big-boned,
so it's starting to even out.

01:13.247 --> 01:15.031
Now...

01:15.075 --> 01:16.511
you ready to give me
those shoes?

01:16.554 --> 01:18.339
[sighs]

01:18.382 --> 01:20.210
You know what?

01:20.254 --> 01:22.299
Fine.

01:23.170 --> 01:25.302
I can't believe this bunch of...

01:25.346 --> 01:27.739
Oh, my God,
is that Santa Claus?

01:27.783 --> 01:30.046
♪

01:31.395 --> 01:34.311
MAN [on TV]: Okay, it's time
to turn up the intensity.

01:34.355 --> 01:37.140
Squat down and up.

01:37.184 --> 01:38.576
Work those glutes.

01:38.620 --> 01:40.578
Push that butt back.
Push those...

01:40.622 --> 01:43.668
Aw, come on, Calvin.
You know, get up.

01:43.712 --> 01:46.236
You promised you would
exercise with me.[chuckles]

01:46.280 --> 01:49.935
Believe you me, baby,
you got my heart rate up plenty.

01:52.024 --> 01:53.287
TINA:
Oh, hey, Malcolm.

01:53.330 --> 01:55.202
You just getting back
from the park with Dave?

01:55.245 --> 01:57.029
Uh, yeah, yeah.

01:57.073 --> 01:58.683
If he ever beats you
in basketball,

01:58.727 --> 02:01.121
we're gonna have
to put you up for adoption.

02:02.600 --> 02:04.515
Well, you don't have
to worry about that.

02:04.559 --> 02:06.300
So I'm-a go take a shower.

02:06.343 --> 02:09.129
Hold on, hold on.
What happened to your shoes?

02:11.043 --> 02:13.307
You know, I lost them.

02:13.350 --> 02:15.918
Don't tell me you lost them
in a game to Dave.

02:15.961 --> 02:19.226
We're gonna have to lie
about this as a family.Yeah.

02:19.269 --> 02:21.706
All right, look, it's no
big deal-- relax-- but...

02:21.750 --> 02:23.578
I just got robbed
down at the park.CALVIN: Whoa, whoa.

02:23.621 --> 02:25.362
What?!You got robbed?

02:25.406 --> 02:27.321
Look, guys, calm down.
I'm fine.

02:27.364 --> 02:29.236
Oh, my God,
thank God you're okay.

02:29.279 --> 02:30.715
Hey, it's cool, Ma.

02:30.759 --> 02:32.195
Who did this, man?

02:32.239 --> 02:33.936
Who attacked you?

02:33.979 --> 02:35.198
Hey, look, it's
no big deal.

02:35.242 --> 02:37.766
It was just some punks
down at the park.

02:37.809 --> 02:39.768
What you mean
it's no big deal?

02:39.811 --> 02:42.205
We're Butlers, right?
You mess with one of us,

02:42.249 --> 02:44.468
you mess with allof us.That's right.

02:44.512 --> 02:47.254
You know what, Tina? Where
you keep my fighting shirt?

02:47.297 --> 02:49.125
No, hold on.'Cause I'll beat up
this whole town.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.388
I know you will.
I know you will.You know I will.

02:51.432 --> 02:54.391
Just relax, okay?
There's no need to fight.
I will take care of it.

02:54.435 --> 02:57.177
You will?Yeah. 'Cause-'cause-'cause
I'm a Butler.

02:57.220 --> 02:59.222
That's right.A-And Butlers
don't play.

02:59.266 --> 03:00.267
Damn right.

03:00.310 --> 03:01.529
You damn right.
Now... [growls]

03:01.572 --> 03:03.357
[growls]
Yeah. Give it
to me. [growls]

03:03.400 --> 03:04.836
[growls]Yeah! [growls]

03:04.880 --> 03:06.447
That's right.

03:07.448 --> 03:08.318
Was he messing with me?

03:10.407 --> 03:12.279
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

03:12.322 --> 03:13.628
♪ Welcome to the hood.

03:20.548 --> 03:22.419
Thanks for helping us
install these cameras.

03:22.463 --> 03:25.205
After what happened to Malcolm,
we're gonna feel so much safer.

03:25.248 --> 03:27.685
Yeah, well, these babies
are top of the line.

03:27.729 --> 03:29.426
You can monitor them
from your phone.

03:29.470 --> 03:31.776
They have night vision and zoom.

03:31.820 --> 03:34.388
You know...
between this tool belt

03:34.431 --> 03:36.607
and all these new
high-tech gadgets,

03:36.651 --> 03:39.393
I kind of feel like Batman.

03:39.436 --> 03:40.872
Really?

03:40.916 --> 03:42.700
'Cause you look like one
of the Village People.

03:44.833 --> 03:46.269
No, no.

03:46.313 --> 03:48.532
[deep voice]:
I'm Batman.

03:50.447 --> 03:51.535
Dad.

03:51.579 --> 03:55.235
Why are you wearing
your fighting shirt?

03:55.278 --> 03:56.540
I'm going down to that park,

03:56.584 --> 03:58.281
and I'm-a find out
who jacked Malcolm.

03:58.325 --> 03:59.674
Well, h-hold on.

03:59.717 --> 04:01.806
I'm-a come with you.
I can help.

04:01.850 --> 04:03.417
How are yougonna help?

04:03.460 --> 04:05.636
Back home I was part
of the Neighborhood Watch.

04:05.680 --> 04:08.335
Now, I don't want
to brag, but...

04:08.378 --> 04:10.772
a couple years ago,
I single-handedly caught

04:10.815 --> 04:13.427
the elusive
Kalamazoo Basil Bandit.

04:13.470 --> 04:15.429
Spoiler alert:

04:15.472 --> 04:16.865
it was a deer.

04:16.908 --> 04:19.041
What?

04:19.084 --> 04:21.217
Spoiler alert:
I don't care.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.566
Look, besides,

04:22.610 --> 04:24.612
I don't need you--
I got Abe and Tommy.

04:24.655 --> 04:26.614
Who are they?A couple of real OGs

04:26.657 --> 04:28.659
that keep their ears
to the streets.

04:28.703 --> 04:31.227
OGs? They're
a couple of old farts

04:31.271 --> 04:34.317
that play chess
in the park all day.

04:34.361 --> 04:36.276
They also do tai chi.

04:37.451 --> 04:40.497
O-Okay, well, I-I'm-a,
I'm-a come with you.
Why?

04:40.541 --> 04:41.846
As backup.

04:41.890 --> 04:43.674
Look, we're a couple
of fathers

04:43.718 --> 04:46.024
who both want to keep
this neighborhood safe.

04:46.068 --> 04:47.330
Also...

04:47.374 --> 04:48.636
[deep voice]:
I'm Batman.

04:51.987 --> 04:53.249
Hey, are the
cameras working?

04:53.293 --> 04:54.511
Mm-hmm.Yep. We can see everything

04:54.555 --> 04:55.686
right here on the TV.

04:55.730 --> 04:57.122
Oh, thank you, Marty.

04:57.166 --> 04:58.428
No, no problem.
I love electronics.

04:58.472 --> 04:59.516
You know, I like
to pretend like

04:59.560 --> 05:01.170
I'm the tech guy
on a covert team

05:01.213 --> 05:02.998
with a cool nickname
like Virus

05:03.041 --> 05:06.001
or... Firewall.

05:06.044 --> 05:08.351
How about Nerd Man?

05:09.874 --> 05:12.399
Okay, Captain Bed Wetter.

05:13.791 --> 05:15.227
That was our secret.

05:15.271 --> 05:17.578
Hey, man, don't
mess with Firewall.

05:17.621 --> 05:19.231
I won't.

05:19.275 --> 05:21.233
Mm, now I got to pee.

05:22.278 --> 05:24.628
So, now do you feel safer?

05:24.672 --> 05:26.413
Here, yeah.

05:26.456 --> 05:28.415
But I'm still worried about
walking around the neighborhood

05:28.458 --> 05:30.373
or taking Grover to the park.

05:30.417 --> 05:32.114
Oh, you should take
a self-defense class.

05:32.157 --> 05:33.550
Oh, please.
She doesn't need that.

05:33.594 --> 05:36.901
I got you.
See, back in the '90s,

05:36.945 --> 05:38.512
when this area was
a little rougher,

05:38.555 --> 05:41.123
I developed my own
self-defense system.

05:41.166 --> 05:41.993
Oh, no.

05:43.168 --> 05:45.693
No, not "Tina kwon do" again.

05:45.736 --> 05:47.129
Please. You loved it.

05:47.172 --> 05:49.000
We used to train
together all the time.

05:49.044 --> 05:50.350
We did not train together!

05:52.221 --> 05:53.831
I put on homemade
protective gear,

05:53.875 --> 05:55.485
and you beat the crap out of me.

05:56.268 --> 05:58.314
It was a bonding
experience.

05:59.620 --> 06:01.970
See, I figured out a
way to defend myself

06:02.013 --> 06:04.538
using things that I
just had in my purse.

06:04.581 --> 06:05.582
Will you teach me?

06:05.626 --> 06:07.236
Of course I will.

06:08.280 --> 06:09.804
Marty, suit up.

06:09.847 --> 06:12.546
No, no, Mama.
I just ate.

06:12.589 --> 06:15.418
Well, if you want, I could
demonstrate without the pads.

06:15.462 --> 06:16.550
All right, fine.

06:16.593 --> 06:18.334
Okay. Oh, oh, and, uh,

06:18.378 --> 06:22.686
wear a extra pillow,
'cause we're going hard.

06:22.730 --> 06:24.166
This is exciting.

06:24.209 --> 06:25.950
You know, I've never done
anything like this before.

06:25.994 --> 06:28.213
On that deer case,
I worked solo.

06:29.519 --> 06:31.652
Must've been nice.

06:31.695 --> 06:33.697
Hey, hey, fellas.

06:33.741 --> 06:34.872
Calvin.

06:34.916 --> 06:37.440
Ain't seen you down here
in a minute.

06:37.484 --> 06:39.660
Hey, guys,
I'm Calvin's friend Dave.

06:39.703 --> 06:41.401
Didn't nobody ask who you were.

06:42.750 --> 06:45.187
And don't nobody care.

06:45.230 --> 06:47.145
He's right, Dave.

06:47.189 --> 06:48.756
They really don't.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.455
Look, fellas,
I don't know if you heard,

06:52.499 --> 06:54.762
but Malcolm got mugged
down here the other day.

06:54.805 --> 06:56.372
Yeah, we saw it.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.330
Check.You did?

06:58.374 --> 06:59.897
W-Well, who did it?

06:59.941 --> 07:01.943
It was Jamaal and them.

07:03.466 --> 07:05.816
You mean those little
kids over there?

07:05.860 --> 07:07.992
Are you kidding me?
This is embarrassing.

07:08.036 --> 07:11.082
Malcolm got rolled by
a bunch of little kids?

07:11.126 --> 07:13.476
Well, it looks like I'm-a
have to go over there

07:13.520 --> 07:15.478
and teach those
little kids a lesson.

07:15.522 --> 07:18.481
I didn't even have
to wear my fighting shirt.

07:18.525 --> 07:20.352
O-Okay, well... just, Calvin,

07:20.396 --> 07:22.485
don't do something
you're gonna regret.

07:22.529 --> 07:24.487
Eh, it's too late
for that, Dave.

07:24.531 --> 07:25.619
I already brought you.

07:26.707 --> 07:28.535
Yo, Jamaal!

07:32.887 --> 07:36.064
I can't believe those little
kids jumped me like that.

07:36.107 --> 07:38.153
It was like watching
a bunch of baby lions

07:38.196 --> 07:40.460
take down a wildebeest.

07:40.503 --> 07:43.288
Where were you, anyway?
You were supposed
to have my back.

07:43.332 --> 07:44.638
Well, I was right there.

07:44.681 --> 07:46.857
I was offering them
my shoes instead of yours.

07:46.901 --> 07:50.339
No one wants your
Skechers, Dave.

07:50.382 --> 07:52.472
I'm letting you
know something--
this ain't over.

07:52.515 --> 07:54.909
We need to teach those
little kids a lesson.

07:54.952 --> 07:58.086
'Cause around here, nobody
messes with Calvin Butler.

07:58.129 --> 07:59.348
Aah!

07:59.391 --> 08:00.523
[whimpering]

08:00.567 --> 08:02.438
I stepped on a acorn.

08:02.482 --> 08:03.831
Come-come over here.

08:03.874 --> 08:05.267
Give me your shoulder,
your shoulder.

08:05.310 --> 08:06.573
Okay. All right.

08:14.102 --> 08:16.713
What the hell, son?

08:18.280 --> 08:20.064
How'd you let yourself
get robbed

08:20.108 --> 08:21.936
by a bunch of little kids?

08:23.546 --> 08:25.548
Why do you only got one shoe on?

08:25.592 --> 08:28.116
Because I got robbed
by a bunch of little kids!

08:29.770 --> 08:32.076
But at least I fought back.

08:32.120 --> 08:34.514
Yeah, and look what it got you--
no shoes, just like me.

08:34.557 --> 08:36.254
Look...

08:36.298 --> 08:38.518
you might want
to count again, Malcolm.

08:38.561 --> 08:39.867
I kept one.

08:41.129 --> 08:42.522
I'm going over to Jamaal's house

08:42.565 --> 08:44.611
and I'm giving his parents
a piece of my mind.

08:44.654 --> 08:47.570
Oh, no, no, please
don't do that, Pop.
That never works out.

08:47.614 --> 08:50.268
What are you
talking about?Fifth grade basketball.

08:50.312 --> 08:51.748
When I wasn't getting
enough playing time,

08:51.792 --> 08:53.881
you went and gave my coach
"a piece of your mind."

08:53.924 --> 08:55.578
I ended up benched
for the whole season.

08:55.622 --> 08:57.493
Well, that's
'cause Sister Mary Agnes

08:57.537 --> 08:59.495
couldn't see talent.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.932
Look, Pop, when you
go talk to people,

09:01.976 --> 09:05.370
it somehow always
turns into a fight.

09:05.414 --> 09:07.024
Look, son,

09:07.068 --> 09:10.071
sometimes a man hasto fight
for his family.

09:10.114 --> 09:13.944
See, you wouldn't know that
because you don't have kids.

09:13.988 --> 09:15.772
Trust me, Malcolm...

09:15.816 --> 09:18.035
this is what
good parenting is.

09:18.079 --> 09:20.037
Now, you might not see it now,

09:20.081 --> 09:22.605
but I-I'm really trying
to help this kid.

09:22.649 --> 09:24.738
You know, the proof
is in the pudding.

09:24.781 --> 09:26.087
I raised a son

09:26.130 --> 09:27.828
with a good head
on his shoulders.

09:27.871 --> 09:30.700
Hey, thank you, Pop.
[chuckles]

09:30.744 --> 09:32.267
I was talking about Marty.

09:35.923 --> 09:38.534
Okay, so I'm-a show you
how we protect ourselves

09:38.578 --> 09:39.622
in the hood.

09:39.666 --> 09:41.363
Marty, get in here!

09:48.631 --> 09:50.198
Okay, so,

09:50.241 --> 09:51.721
whenever I'm in the streets,

09:51.765 --> 09:54.855
I always carry three
self-defense essentials.

09:56.291 --> 09:58.423
Weapon number one.

09:58.467 --> 10:00.251
A comb?

10:00.295 --> 10:03.603
[laughs] It may
look like a comb...

10:03.646 --> 10:05.866
because it is
a comb, but...

10:07.694 --> 10:09.347
...in the right hands,

10:09.391 --> 10:12.089
stab, stab, stab, stab, stab!

10:14.701 --> 10:16.659
See?

10:16.703 --> 10:18.879
I'm safer, and, bonus...

10:18.922 --> 10:21.055
I look fresh.

10:21.098 --> 10:22.622
Eh?

10:22.665 --> 10:24.624
Marty, are you okay?

10:24.667 --> 10:26.930
Aw, he's fine.
Okay, so...

10:26.974 --> 10:30.455
weapon number two.

10:30.499 --> 10:31.892
Seasoning salt?

10:31.935 --> 10:34.895
Cheaper than pepper spray
and really good on chicken.

10:36.374 --> 10:37.724
Close your eyes, baby.Huh?

10:37.767 --> 10:40.683
Shake! Shake, shake,
shake, shake!Oh!

10:40.727 --> 10:42.685
Aah! That burns!

10:42.729 --> 10:44.687
It burns so bad.[chuckles]

10:44.731 --> 10:46.689
[screams]

10:46.733 --> 10:49.736
[sneezing]

10:51.563 --> 10:54.305
Now, third
and most lethal weapon.

10:54.349 --> 10:55.916
A whiskey bag?

10:55.959 --> 10:58.222
Full of spare change.[coins jingling]

10:59.571 --> 11:01.748
Now, to the untrained eye,
you know,

11:01.791 --> 11:05.360
I'm just an alcoholic

11:05.403 --> 11:07.710
on my way to the Coinstar.Mm-hmm.

11:07.754 --> 11:11.018
But to the unsuspecting
predator?

11:11.061 --> 11:12.976
Ka-ching! Ka-ching, ka-ching![grunting]

11:13.020 --> 11:15.196
Ka-ching![groans]

11:21.724 --> 11:23.683
You ready to try?

11:23.726 --> 11:25.162
Uh, I think so.

11:25.206 --> 11:26.773
Okay, girl. All right.

11:26.816 --> 11:29.819
So, you're walking
down the street.

11:35.346 --> 11:38.306
Okay, and an assailant
approaches you.

11:38.349 --> 11:40.438
What do you do?

11:40.482 --> 11:43.703
Uh, I guess I would whack
him a couple times here.Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

11:45.879 --> 11:47.619
And then maybe a...

11:47.663 --> 11:50.318
a tappity-tap-tap here.

11:51.798 --> 11:53.800
I'm so sorry, Marty.
Are you okay?

11:53.843 --> 11:55.715
Honestly, anything's better
than the salt.

11:55.758 --> 11:57.020
Oh.

11:57.064 --> 11:58.848
Come on, Gemma.Okay.

11:58.892 --> 12:01.677
This is street warfare, okay?Okay.

12:01.721 --> 12:05.028
Like, just imagine this
man has stolen your purse!

12:06.943 --> 12:08.902
What do you do?

12:08.945 --> 12:11.600
[grunts]

12:11.643 --> 12:14.429
Now give me back
my purse, please.

12:14.472 --> 12:15.778
"Please"?"Please"?

12:17.606 --> 12:19.390
Yeah, yeah, we... we got
a lot of work to do,

12:19.434 --> 12:20.652
or you gonna die.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.699
Thanks for asking me
to come along

12:23.743 --> 12:25.222
to talk to Jamaal's parents.

12:25.266 --> 12:27.268
I didn't ask you to come along.

12:30.488 --> 12:33.753
Okay, now, Calvin, remember,

12:33.796 --> 12:35.580
we're talking about
someone's child,

12:35.624 --> 12:39.106
so we need to be reasonable,
keep our voices at an even tone,

12:39.149 --> 12:41.761
and, no matter what,
never be aggressive.

12:44.633 --> 12:46.591
Come on out!
I want to talk to you

12:46.635 --> 12:48.680
about your little punk-ass son!

12:50.639 --> 12:53.468
Hey, check it out.

12:53.511 --> 12:55.818
Looks like Gramps
got another shoe, huh?

12:55.862 --> 12:57.820
[chuckles]

12:57.864 --> 12:59.953
[chuckles]:
"Gramps"? That's all you got?

12:59.996 --> 13:01.041
Boy, I'll kill you!Okay.

13:01.084 --> 13:02.782
Calvin, Calvin.

13:02.825 --> 13:04.696
He's a child. Calm down.

13:04.740 --> 13:07.264
Yeah, man,
you better listen to your nurse.

13:07.308 --> 13:09.527
Hmm.

13:09.571 --> 13:11.791
You said that like
it hurt my feelings.

13:11.834 --> 13:13.531
My aunt is a nurse.

13:14.794 --> 13:18.058
Jamaal, where are your parents?They ain't here.

13:18.101 --> 13:19.929
Well, where are they?None of your business.

13:19.973 --> 13:21.757
Oh, I'll make it
my business! You...Okay.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.280
Okay, Calvin.I want the door open.

13:23.324 --> 13:26.327
[chuckles]: Careful, old man.
You gonna hurt yourself.

13:27.632 --> 13:30.722
This was fun,
but I'm gonna go back inside

13:30.766 --> 13:33.029
and watch TV.
Night-night, Gramps.

13:33.073 --> 13:35.989
And, nurse,
make sure he takes his medicine.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.296
Yeah, well, joke's on you.

13:39.340 --> 13:41.821
My aunt's saved
hundreds of lives!

13:43.823 --> 13:46.564
That kid is disrespectful.

13:46.608 --> 13:49.045
That's because clearly
his parents aren't around.

13:49.089 --> 13:51.918
Which is why it's up to us
to teach him a lesson.

13:53.963 --> 13:56.792
H-Hold on,
b-by stealing his bike?

13:56.836 --> 14:00.187
It's called good parenting,
Dave.

14:00.230 --> 14:01.710
Hey, Jamaal!

14:01.753 --> 14:04.365
If you want your bike back,
come find me!

14:04.408 --> 14:06.019
You getting on or what?

14:06.062 --> 14:07.498
Well, just for the record,
I do not approve

14:07.542 --> 14:09.326
of this method
of conflict resolution.

14:10.458 --> 14:12.503
All right, how do you
want to do this?

14:12.547 --> 14:14.027
What, do I grab a hold
of your waist?

14:14.070 --> 14:15.463
Shoulders. Shoulders.

14:15.506 --> 14:17.508
[bell dings]

14:22.687 --> 14:26.735
Listen, Gemma, I know
that you are a sweetheart.

14:26.778 --> 14:29.303
But this is not Kalamazoo!

14:29.346 --> 14:30.826
Okay. Okay.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.132
Okay?!Okay.

14:32.175 --> 14:34.308
When someone comes after you,

14:34.351 --> 14:36.484
you got to go there.Yeah.

14:36.527 --> 14:38.051
I don't want to hurt Marty.

14:38.094 --> 14:39.095
Screw Marty!

14:39.139 --> 14:41.489
Mama!

14:41.532 --> 14:43.621
He's not Marty.

14:43.665 --> 14:46.537
He is a bad guy, okay?Yeah. Okay.

14:46.581 --> 14:49.540
You need to channel
your inner anger!Okay.

14:49.584 --> 14:52.848
[panting]What is it gonna take
for you to release

14:52.892 --> 14:55.372
and unleash that inner beast

14:55.416 --> 14:58.549
and go after this monster?Uh...

14:58.593 --> 15:01.335
Uh, uh...

15:01.378 --> 15:03.946
I guess if somebody was
really trying to hurt Grover.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.469
Good.Yeah.

15:05.513 --> 15:06.949
Use that, okay?Okay.

15:06.993 --> 15:08.603
Okay.This sicko...

15:08.646 --> 15:10.431
GEMMA:
Mm-hmm.Whoa, whoa.

15:10.474 --> 15:12.172
...is going after your kid.Yeah.

15:12.215 --> 15:15.653
What are you gonna do
to protect your little boy?Yeah.

15:15.697 --> 15:18.787
Mama, I am yourlittle boy.

15:18.830 --> 15:21.833
Not today, sicko!

15:21.877 --> 15:23.444
[grunting]Get him!

15:23.487 --> 15:25.533
Don't hurt my little boy!Get him!

15:25.576 --> 15:29.580
[grunting]Yeah! Yeah!

15:29.624 --> 15:32.453
Yeah!Gemma, it's me, Marty!

15:32.496 --> 15:33.628
[grunts]

15:38.328 --> 15:40.287
Cool!

15:40.330 --> 15:42.289
Mom knocked out Firewall.

15:46.032 --> 15:47.207
[Calvin chuckles]

15:47.250 --> 15:50.558
Like that.

15:52.038 --> 15:54.779
That's right. A bike for a shoe.

15:54.823 --> 15:57.565
[chuckles]
Holla at ya boy.

15:57.608 --> 15:59.262
You stole his bike?

15:59.306 --> 16:01.873
That's right. Because I care.

16:03.701 --> 16:06.922
Look, the boy's got to learn
that actions have consequences.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.532
An eye for an eye.

16:08.576 --> 16:10.882
Yeah, well, Gandhi said,
"An eye for an eye

16:10.926 --> 16:12.362
makes the whole world blind."

16:12.406 --> 16:15.017
Well, Gandhi didn't wear
$300 sneakers.

16:15.061 --> 16:17.541
[knock on door]

16:17.585 --> 16:19.761
Look at you, Pop.

16:19.804 --> 16:23.721
Look who I found outside
about to tag your truck.

16:23.765 --> 16:25.114
About to tag mytruck?

16:25.158 --> 16:27.769
Malcolm, go get some bail money.
I'm going to jail.

16:27.812 --> 16:30.293
Whoa, no, no, no, no.
No, Pop. No. No, stop.

16:30.337 --> 16:31.686
Calm down. Pop.

16:31.729 --> 16:35.385
Now, just let me talk
to him for a minute.

16:35.429 --> 16:37.779
Fine. But after that, he's mine.

16:37.822 --> 16:39.999
Hey, you need backup?

16:40.042 --> 16:41.826
I've been on this case
since the beginning.

16:41.870 --> 16:43.741
That was today, Dave.

16:43.785 --> 16:46.309
Yeah, I know. And look,
we already caught the perp.

16:46.353 --> 16:47.615
[scoffs]

16:49.486 --> 16:51.445
Man, here we go.

16:51.488 --> 16:54.578
Now you're gonna give me a
lecture on stealing, right?No.

16:54.622 --> 16:56.624
I wasn't gonna
give you a lecture.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.582
I was gonna tell you
I'll go in there

16:58.626 --> 16:59.583
and get your bike back.

16:59.627 --> 17:01.194
What's the catch?

17:01.237 --> 17:02.847
Well, you got to
listen to my lecture.

17:03.979 --> 17:05.937
Jamaal,

17:05.981 --> 17:07.809
I know what it's
like to be your age.

17:07.852 --> 17:10.333
You're trying to figure
out how to be a man.

17:10.377 --> 17:12.596
But in this neighborhood...

17:12.640 --> 17:13.728
well, some people
have a different idea

17:13.771 --> 17:15.251
of what that means.

17:15.295 --> 17:17.949
I know what it means.
I ama man.

17:17.993 --> 17:19.560
Don't tell me what
a man you are.

17:19.603 --> 17:21.344
Your bicycle still
has a bell on it.

17:22.476 --> 17:24.434
But, hey,

17:24.478 --> 17:26.088
Jamaal, that's a good thing.

17:26.132 --> 17:27.698
Because it means you
still get to choose

17:27.742 --> 17:29.570
what kind of man
you want to be.

17:29.613 --> 17:32.486
Now, do you want to be a
weak one or a strong one?

17:32.529 --> 17:34.575
I was strong enough
to take your shoes.

17:34.618 --> 17:37.882
Oh, you think so? Because
the way I remember it,

17:37.926 --> 17:40.363
after half a block
I stopped running,

17:40.407 --> 17:42.670
turned around, and
gave you my shoes.

17:42.713 --> 17:45.281
That's 'cause you were afraid.

17:45.325 --> 17:47.718
[laughs]

17:47.762 --> 17:50.591
Jamaal, I am a grown
man, and if I wanted to,

17:50.634 --> 17:53.115
I could've beat the black off
of you and your tiny crew.

17:54.812 --> 17:56.553
But I didn't.

17:56.597 --> 17:58.686
Because when I was your
age, my father taught me

17:58.729 --> 18:02.342
what makes a man truly strong
is helping other people.

18:02.385 --> 18:04.170
You mean Gramps in there?

18:04.213 --> 18:06.781
[chuckles]:
Yeah.

18:06.824 --> 18:10.741
I know his methods may seem
a little old-school,

18:10.785 --> 18:14.223
but my father is
the strongest man that I know.

18:14.267 --> 18:16.269
[bell dinging]

18:19.924 --> 18:21.883
I wonder what Malcolm's saying

18:21.926 --> 18:24.103
to that little thuglet
out there.

18:26.148 --> 18:28.019
You know what?
We can watch 'em

18:28.063 --> 18:29.847
on the security cam
feed on my phone.

18:31.153 --> 18:34.287
Unless you think spying on
them would be unethical.

18:34.330 --> 18:38.073
Dave, we stole a kid's bike.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.293
Oh, that ship has sailed.

18:42.643 --> 18:45.602
Jamaal, what my father taught me
is that strength doesn't mean

18:45.646 --> 18:47.604
being able to take things
from other people.

18:47.648 --> 18:50.390
It means being able
to earn them for yourself.

18:50.433 --> 18:52.131
It means doing the right thing

18:52.174 --> 18:53.871
even when the wrong thing
looks easier.

18:53.915 --> 18:56.613
And most important,

18:56.657 --> 18:59.790
real strength doesn't come
from pushing other people down.

18:59.834 --> 19:02.271
It comes from lifting 'em up.

19:02.315 --> 19:04.578
You give me some speech,

19:04.621 --> 19:06.754
and it's supposed to change
my life?

19:07.537 --> 19:09.713
Brother, I wish it could.

19:09.757 --> 19:12.107
But how about this?

19:12.151 --> 19:13.717
I'll meet you at the park
every Saturday.

19:13.761 --> 19:15.676
We shoot hoops and we talk

19:15.719 --> 19:17.112
about whatever you want.

19:17.156 --> 19:21.029
That's it. Now,
you show up if you like.

19:21.072 --> 19:23.074
Maybe.

19:23.118 --> 19:26.034
All right, cool.
Now, like I promised,

19:26.077 --> 19:27.644
I'll go get your bike back.

19:28.689 --> 19:31.692
That's not necessary, son.

19:31.735 --> 19:35.478
Looks like my plan
to lure Jamaal over here

19:35.522 --> 19:38.089
so that you could have
a talk with him...

19:38.133 --> 19:39.743
has worked.

19:42.006 --> 19:44.183
You can have your bike back.

19:45.140 --> 19:47.360
Um, Dave, are you crying?

19:50.450 --> 19:53.670
It takes a strong man
to show his emotions.

19:54.758 --> 19:57.283
Oh, oh, no tears on
the fighting shirt.

20:04.290 --> 20:05.508
Come and get it, boy.Pop, come on, man.

20:05.552 --> 20:08.685
[whooping]

20:08.729 --> 20:10.557
Gonna dunk on you.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.254
Yeah, right.You're getting ready
to get punked right...

20:12.298 --> 20:13.255
Man, just shoot...
Aah!

20:13.299 --> 20:15.866
Oh.[scoffs]

20:15.910 --> 20:18.260
Look who's here.
The kid showed up.
