00:00.069 --> 00:01.705
Previously on "For the People"...

00:01.729 --> 00:03.094
- Who are you?
- Ted.

00:03.118 --> 00:04.737
Ted is our new investigator.

00:04.737 --> 00:06.914
Good win for Ms. Littlejohn, Mr. Knox,

00:06.938 --> 00:08.894
and oops, one loss from...

00:08.918 --> 00:10.250
Oh, and here he is now.

00:10.274 --> 00:12.169
This is Leonard Knox's old office.

00:12.193 --> 00:14.186
Unfortunately, it didn't come
with his case load.

00:14.210 --> 00:16.758
Roger brought me back to work
on the Julian Sarco case.

00:16.782 --> 00:18.728
- He called you back from Texas?
- Yes.

00:18.752 --> 00:20.975
I'm right here. Right not in Texas.

00:20.999 --> 00:23.329
And he brings you back?

00:25.000 --> 00:31.074

00:42.034 --> 00:43.331
Oliver! Let's go.

00:44.067 --> 00:45.369
Now!

00:46.171 --> 00:47.954
Petrini crime family. Do you know them?

00:47.978 --> 00:49.031
Personally?

00:49.055 --> 00:50.456
Violent and Organized Crime Unit

00:50.480 --> 00:52.055
has been trying to build a RICO case

00:52.079 --> 00:54.523
against the Petrini family for two years,

00:54.547 --> 00:55.740
getting nowhere,

00:55.764 --> 00:57.060
and then suddenly, last night,

00:57.084 --> 00:59.875
Angelo Petrini,
nephew of boss Gaetano Petrini,

00:59.899 --> 01:02.343
walks into a field office on 23rd Street,

01:02.367 --> 01:03.775
and he is singing.

01:03.799 --> 01:05.123
This has the potential to be

01:05.147 --> 01:06.785
the biggest prosecution
in this office in years.

01:06.809 --> 01:08.132
Do you need me to help you find Kate?

01:08.156 --> 01:10.838
- No... No. Listen.
- Leonard...?

01:10.862 --> 01:13.010
Oliver, I need you on this.

01:13.011 --> 01:14.134
I know I give you a hard time.

01:14.158 --> 01:15.211
It's 'cause I want you to be the best,

01:15.235 --> 01:16.844
and I know you can be the best.

01:16.868 --> 01:18.721
There's nobody more valuable
in this office.

01:18.745 --> 01:20.390
Nobody I have more confidence in.

01:20.414 --> 01:21.641
Nobody I trust more.

01:21.665 --> 01:23.657
You are gonna take this family down.

01:23.681 --> 01:25.984
Okay? You!

01:26.008 --> 01:27.895
- Give me the music.
- What?

01:30.908 --> 01:32.030
- No...
- Right now! Come on.

01:32.054 --> 01:34.081
"The Godfather"! Give it to me!

01:37.060 --> 01:38.148
Louder!

01:39.910 --> 01:41.346
Louder! Louder!

01:47.452 --> 01:48.698
Sounds pretty good.

01:49.991 --> 01:51.447
Is that "Avatar"?

01:52.450 --> 01:55.471
Can you just... leave...?

02:09.244 --> 02:10.470
Knox!

02:20.831 --> 02:22.149
Oh, Jenn.

02:22.174 --> 02:23.650
I'm sorry.

02:28.731 --> 02:30.514
The coffee upstairs, ugh,

02:30.538 --> 02:32.482
I'm sure you won't miss that.

02:47.812 --> 02:49.647
First time on the 11th floor?

02:49.648 --> 02:51.987
Unless you count the elevator.

02:52.011 --> 02:54.037
But I know this is where the action is...

02:54.061 --> 02:55.810
- This is Asset Forfeiture.
- Exactly.

02:55.834 --> 02:57.061
And I just wanted to say,

02:57.085 --> 02:58.348
if there's ever an opening...

02:58.372 --> 02:59.669
There is, actually. Right now.

02:59.693 --> 03:00.711
Right now?

03:00.735 --> 03:02.032
Wow! Okay.

03:02.056 --> 03:04.452
Well, that's, uh, great timing.

03:05.996 --> 03:07.015
Vulture!

03:07.039 --> 03:09.725
I... I didn't... know...

03:09.749 --> 03:10.824
You're in General Crimes, right?

03:10.848 --> 03:12.157
Roger Gunn.

03:13.095 --> 03:14.217
Amazing experience.

03:14.241 --> 03:16.164
Roger is such an incredible mentor...

03:16.188 --> 03:17.415
- He's the devil.
- He is.

03:17.439 --> 03:19.397
You need five trials
to move out of General Crimes

03:19.421 --> 03:20.960
into a more senior unit.

03:20.984 --> 03:22.142
Do you have five trials?

03:22.166 --> 03:23.185
More or less.

03:23.209 --> 03:24.897
- More or less?
- Yes.

03:24.898 --> 03:26.796
More? Or less?

03:27.192 --> 03:28.590
Yes.

03:29.521 --> 03:31.338
You seem a little desperate. I like that.

03:31.362 --> 03:33.285
You also seem to have issues
with Roger Gunn.

03:33.309 --> 03:34.675
I like that, too.

03:34.699 --> 03:36.205
If you can get yourself another trial,

03:36.229 --> 03:37.456
I can move this along.

03:37.480 --> 03:40.827
Well. I have a trial in the pipeline,

03:40.851 --> 03:44.064
so I will be seizing your assets
very soon.

04:02.880 --> 04:04.959
Uh, 1, please.

04:05.554 --> 04:06.961
20's fine.

04:08.980 --> 04:11.146
Punctured a lung, cracked his spine,

04:11.170 --> 04:12.710
grade-three concussion.

04:12.734 --> 04:15.096
His wife's seven months pregnant.

04:23.891 --> 04:25.153
What happened?

04:25.177 --> 04:26.822
ATF agent was assaulted

04:26.846 --> 04:28.593
investigating a strip club
in Hell's Kitchen.

04:28.617 --> 04:29.915
Thrown down the stairs
and hit over the head

04:29.939 --> 04:31.027
with a bottle of Cognac.

04:31.051 --> 04:32.987
What kind of strip club serves Cognac?

04:33.715 --> 04:35.568
I'm not a strip club guy.

04:35.592 --> 04:37.063
I want you to know
that everyone in this office

04:37.087 --> 04:38.383
considers an attack on one of you

04:38.407 --> 04:39.808
an attack on all of us.

04:39.832 --> 04:42.277
We will bring this assailant to justice

04:42.301 --> 04:44.292
and we look forward
to convicting him at trial.

04:44.316 --> 04:45.335
Trial?

04:45.359 --> 04:47.473
No deals on this one, apparently.

04:47.474 --> 04:49.535
You have to go to Roger
and tell him you want this case.

04:49.559 --> 04:50.994
I don't want this case.

04:51.018 --> 04:52.419
I know. I want it.

04:52.443 --> 04:53.566
So why don't you go to Roger

04:53.590 --> 04:54.887
and tell him you want this case?

04:54.911 --> 04:56.069
How does that make any sense?

04:56.093 --> 04:57.112
Well, he likes you now...

04:57.136 --> 04:58.584
No. No. He doesn't.

04:58.585 --> 04:59.707
He doesn't like me.

04:59.731 --> 05:00.750
He doesn't respect me.

05:00.774 --> 05:02.140
And it's never gonna change.

05:02.164 --> 05:03.114
I need to get out of here.

05:03.138 --> 05:04.503
You're gonna leave?

05:04.527 --> 05:06.102
We're all gonna leave
General Crimes sooner or later.

05:06.126 --> 05:07.667
I just need it to be sooner.

05:07.691 --> 05:10.011
There's an opening
in Asset Forfeiture right now.

05:10.011 --> 05:11.794
If I can get a trial,
I have a shot at it.

05:11.818 --> 05:13.846
So I need you to go
and get me this trial.

05:13.870 --> 05:15.757
Please?

05:27.090 --> 05:29.082
Whoo! Bear claw me, baby!

05:29.106 --> 05:30.841
Bear claw, right here.

05:32.622 --> 05:33.775
- Is that too big?
- Yes.

05:33.799 --> 05:35.338
Allison got a Motion to Suppress,

05:35.362 --> 05:36.693
- she gets the bear claw.
- Mm.

05:36.717 --> 05:38.692
Well, I've got a hearing today
in the Lindstrom case,

05:38.693 --> 05:39.989
and I'm going to crush it.

05:40.013 --> 05:42.055
- There are no pre-emptive bear claws!
- Mm.

05:42.079 --> 05:44.648
That's a flagrant violation
of the donut code.

05:44.672 --> 05:47.740
Sandra, I need you over at the MCC.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.153
Why are you holding that bear claw?

05:50.788 --> 05:52.155
- Oh, I thought...
- Put it down.

05:52.179 --> 05:53.962
Put it down! Now!

05:59.735 --> 06:00.823
What is this?

06:00.847 --> 06:02.368
It's a bear claw.

06:03.314 --> 06:05.968
- Ugh.
- I don't like almonds.

06:09.424 --> 06:10.757
Are you okay?

06:10.781 --> 06:12.911
This is a kidnapping.

06:12.935 --> 06:14.589
A baby.

06:15.230 --> 06:17.847
I had no idea
that there was a baby inside.

06:17.871 --> 06:18.994
You didn't see the car seat?

06:19.018 --> 06:20.732
What do I know from car seats?

06:20.756 --> 06:22.504
It's dark, the baby's
facing the other way...

06:22.528 --> 06:24.728
it just looked like
some sort of bucket thing.

06:24.752 --> 06:26.536
Like maybe a mini-fridge, I don't know.

06:26.560 --> 06:28.969
Rich people always have
weird stuff in their cars.

06:28.993 --> 06:30.985
You know, I blame
the diamond industry, you know?

06:31.009 --> 06:32.368
Two months' salary
for an engagement ring?

06:32.392 --> 06:33.452
That's crazy town.

06:33.476 --> 06:34.599
I'm not following.

06:34.600 --> 06:37.252
I may have boosted some cars in my past.

06:37.276 --> 06:38.399
I know this guy in Jersey.

06:38.423 --> 06:40.137
He's got this whole operation.

06:40.161 --> 06:41.422
That night, I left my buddy's party,

06:41.446 --> 06:42.501
I walked outside,

06:42.525 --> 06:43.890
and there's the Audi just sitting there,

06:43.914 --> 06:45.211
like it was meant to be, you know,

06:45.235 --> 06:47.610
'cause I want to propose but
I don't have the money for it,

06:47.634 --> 06:49.701
and like... here's the money!

06:49.702 --> 06:50.756
Who the hell leaves a baby in a car

06:50.780 --> 06:52.042
in the middle of the night?

06:52.066 --> 06:53.432
Well, her father said

06:53.456 --> 06:54.919
he'd been driving around
for hours to help her sleep.

06:54.943 --> 06:57.185
He didn't want to wake her
while he ran in for coffee.

06:57.209 --> 06:58.680
Yeah, well,
the driving thing worked, man,

06:58.704 --> 07:00.051
'cause that baby was out.

07:00.052 --> 07:01.905
When did you realize she was in the car?

07:01.929 --> 07:03.018
When she started crying.

07:03.042 --> 07:04.608
I almost drove off the road.

07:04.609 --> 07:06.878
You didn't think about turning around?

07:06.902 --> 07:09.520
Have you ever been in a car
with a crying baby?

07:09.544 --> 07:10.876
I mean, there was no clarity, lady.

07:10.900 --> 07:12.648
You just want it to stop.

07:12.672 --> 07:14.109
I went to my girl's.

07:14.133 --> 07:15.360
She grew up with a ton of cousins.

07:15.384 --> 07:17.619
She'd know what to do,
but she wasn't home.

07:17.643 --> 07:19.114
She picked up an overnight at the IHOP,

07:19.138 --> 07:20.966
so I grabbed the kid,

07:20.966 --> 07:22.993
the... the baby bag,
whatever it's called,

07:23.017 --> 07:24.835
and I let myself in to wait for her.

07:24.859 --> 07:27.060
And it was just you, the baby,
there by yourselves

07:27.084 --> 07:28.726
until the police came?

07:28.750 --> 07:30.709
I got her to stop crying, you know?

07:30.733 --> 07:31.926
I sang her some songs,

07:31.950 --> 07:33.409
even followed the directions
on the formula can.

07:33.433 --> 07:34.706
I made her a bottle.

07:36.792 --> 07:38.749
How bad could this be for me?

07:38.773 --> 07:40.174
If you're convicted of kidnapping

07:40.198 --> 07:42.399
and transporting a minor
across state lines,

07:42.423 --> 07:45.591
you'd definitely be looking
at a significant prison term.

07:45.592 --> 07:47.411
But let me talk to the prosecutor,

07:47.435 --> 07:51.234
see if I can get it down
to just the car, okay?

07:53.294 --> 07:55.355
Your Honor, the defendant, Adrian Carpov,

07:55.379 --> 07:57.787
is charged with one count
of assaulting an officer

07:57.811 --> 08:01.298
of the United States,
in violation of 18 USC 111...

08:01.322 --> 08:03.508
Is not a problem.

08:03.509 --> 08:06.126
Well, maybe we have
a different definition

08:06.150 --> 08:07.760
of the word "problem."

08:07.784 --> 08:10.117
Or maybe is not a problem.

08:10.118 --> 08:11.901
Counsel, can you advise Mr. Carpov

08:11.925 --> 08:13.256
to refrain from talking?

08:13.280 --> 08:15.480
I can try, Your Honor.

08:15.504 --> 08:18.344
Your Honor, as to bail,
given the vicious nature

08:18.345 --> 08:19.503
of this assault,

08:19.527 --> 08:23.974
we believe Mr. Carpov is a danger to...

08:30.266 --> 08:32.852
Your Honor, is there a problem?

08:34.188 --> 08:37.118
Mr. Carpov is the senior officer

08:37.142 --> 08:39.760
at the Transnistrian Consulate
here in New York.

08:39.784 --> 08:41.894
The what consulate?

08:41.895 --> 08:43.434
According to his official accreditation

08:43.458 --> 08:45.034
by the U.S. Department of State,

08:45.058 --> 08:47.328
and pursuant to our bilateral agreement

08:47.352 --> 08:49.622
with the Republic of Transnistria,

08:49.646 --> 08:53.414
Mr. Carpov is classified
as a diplomatic agent.

08:53.992 --> 08:55.075
Him?

08:55.302 --> 08:57.051
Right here?

08:57.075 --> 09:00.561
Which means he enjoys
complete personal inviolability

09:00.585 --> 09:02.681
and immunity
from the criminal jurisdiction

09:02.705 --> 09:04.330
of his host country.

09:04.330 --> 09:06.844
Which means he cannot be prosecuted

09:06.868 --> 09:10.515
or compelled to testify,
no matter the offense.

09:11.789 --> 09:13.155
In terms of a trial date...

09:13.179 --> 09:14.963
There will be no trial, Mr. Oliver.

09:14.987 --> 09:16.074
Charges are hereby dismissed.

09:16.098 --> 09:17.534
Deputy.

09:17.558 --> 09:19.480
Please release the defendant.

09:19.504 --> 09:22.318
See? Not a problem.

Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

09:31.807 --> 09:33.519
Transnistria.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.239
I can't even say it.

09:35.264 --> 09:37.578
I cannot even say it.

09:37.579 --> 09:38.597
You know where I grew up?

09:38.621 --> 09:41.065
Omaha, on Pine Street,

09:41.089 --> 09:43.255
one street over from Walnut Street.

09:43.279 --> 09:47.008
Around the corner
from Ak... Aks... Aksba...

09:47.032 --> 09:48.816
Aksarb... Aksarben Shopping.

09:48.817 --> 09:50.218
Aah! Whatever.

09:50.242 --> 09:52.720
This was my ticket away from Roger Gunn

09:52.744 --> 09:54.862
and into Asset Forfeiture.

09:56.391 --> 09:57.953
You hear me?

09:59.157 --> 10:00.385
That wasn't rhetorical.

10:00.410 --> 10:01.950
Do you hear me?

10:01.975 --> 10:03.068
Kate?

10:03.093 --> 10:04.112
Kate.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.317
Kate!

10:07.666 --> 10:08.858
I need your help here.

10:08.883 --> 10:10.042
Can it wait 20 hours?

10:10.067 --> 10:11.572
You mean 20 minutes?

10:11.597 --> 10:12.616
Hours.

10:12.641 --> 10:13.974
My bank robbery case just settled,

10:13.975 --> 10:15.307
so I'm trying to use this little window

10:15.331 --> 10:17.218
to get a jump on my 24 hours

10:17.242 --> 10:18.936
of Minimum Continuing Legal Education.

10:18.937 --> 10:21.729
This is a lecture on
commercial vehicle litigation.

10:21.753 --> 10:22.944
Pretty interesting, actually...

10:22.968 --> 10:25.968
Your MCLE isn't due for two years!

10:25.992 --> 10:27.881
Is there a better use of my time
right now?

10:27.905 --> 10:29.340
Yes. Helping me!

10:29.364 --> 10:30.987
I helped you! I got you this case!

10:30.987 --> 10:32.701
And now you need to help me keep it.

10:32.725 --> 10:34.705
Do you know why Carpov
was at that strip club?

10:34.705 --> 10:35.898
Strippers.

10:35.922 --> 10:38.973
- Yes, maybe. And Cognac.
- Both pungent.

10:38.997 --> 10:40.857
The owner stocks rare bottles of Cognac,

10:40.881 --> 10:42.189
because Carpov and his friends

10:42.213 --> 10:44.426
will spend $1,000 on a single glass.

10:44.427 --> 10:45.689
Which he can afford,

10:45.713 --> 10:47.846
because he's never had to pay
118 parking tickets.

10:47.846 --> 10:49.699
New York parking laws can be tricky.

10:49.723 --> 10:50.950
Whose side are you on?

10:50.974 --> 10:52.375
This isn't about sides, Seth.

10:52.399 --> 10:53.558
It's about getting you to leave.

10:53.582 --> 10:55.609
Drop it. Find another trial.

10:55.633 --> 10:57.172
You know how hard it is to find a case

10:57.196 --> 10:58.459
that actually goes to trial.

10:58.483 --> 11:00.109
And then remember,
we're talking about me.

11:00.110 --> 11:02.032
And this guy attacked an ATF agent!

11:02.056 --> 11:03.840
So, no. I'm not gonna drop this.

11:03.864 --> 11:05.877
I'm going to trial!

11:07.902 --> 11:09.811
- What?
- Trial!

11:11.139 --> 11:12.540
You don't want to go to trial on this.

11:12.565 --> 11:13.722
I'm happy to go to trial.

11:13.747 --> 11:15.218
He was trying to steal a car...

11:15.243 --> 11:16.511
He did steal a car.

11:16.511 --> 11:18.016
The kidnapping was an accident.

11:18.041 --> 11:19.616
He didn't know the baby was in there.

11:19.641 --> 11:21.023
There was no ransom demand...

11:21.023 --> 11:23.119
He was caught before he had
the chance to make a demand.

11:23.143 --> 11:24.648
What are you offering? Nothing.

11:24.672 --> 11:26.247
There's a mandatory minimum of 20 years,

11:26.271 --> 11:28.394
plus he has to register as a sex
offender for the rest of his life.

11:28.395 --> 11:30.178
- A sex offender?
- It's mandatory.

11:30.202 --> 11:31.325
But there is no evidence...

11:31.349 --> 11:33.898
There is a presumption
when you kidnap a child.

11:33.922 --> 11:35.174
This wasn't a kidnapping.

11:35.175 --> 11:36.507
You keep saying that,

11:36.531 --> 11:39.565
but your client stole a car
with a baby in the back.

11:39.589 --> 11:40.990
The windows weren't tinted.

11:41.014 --> 11:42.519
He had the baby for two hours.

11:42.543 --> 11:44.904
He was found inside an apartment
in another state

11:44.905 --> 11:45.993
with the baby in his arms.

11:46.017 --> 11:48.253
If you think it's something
else, then show me.

11:48.277 --> 11:49.574
Otherwise, it's 20 years,

11:49.598 --> 11:51.774
whether or not we go to trial.

11:51.775 --> 11:53.384
Carpov? I gave that to Littlejohn.

11:53.408 --> 11:54.669
- She gave it to me.
- I don't know.

11:54.693 --> 11:56.616
Maybe she was overwhelmed by it.

11:56.640 --> 11:58.319
But I am ready to take this to trial.

11:58.343 --> 12:00.231
Well, nobody wants to see
this guy go down more than me.

12:00.255 --> 12:02.734
But Transnistria has
to waive Carpov's immunity

12:02.735 --> 12:03.857
in order for us to press charges,

12:03.881 --> 12:05.294
and they have no incentive to do that.

12:05.295 --> 12:06.730
I think we have a shot.

12:06.754 --> 12:08.537
This isn't the first time
this guy broke the law.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.102
He has an extensive criminal history...

12:10.126 --> 12:12.010
assault, DUIs, gambling.

12:12.010 --> 12:13.654
You set a meeting with State, Justice,

12:13.678 --> 12:15.393
and the Transnistrian Ambassador,

12:15.417 --> 12:16.922
I'll get them to waive immunity.

12:16.946 --> 12:18.521
No.

12:18.545 --> 12:19.599
- Sir...
- No.

12:19.623 --> 12:22.718
Now, I have 25 poorly drafted
indictments to mark up.

12:22.719 --> 12:24.537
I do not have time for this.

12:24.561 --> 12:26.692
- What if I mark up the indictments?
- What?

12:26.716 --> 12:28.569
Clean them up so all you have
to do is sign your name.

12:28.593 --> 12:30.168
You'll get back an extra 10 hours a week

12:30.192 --> 12:31.384
to do whatever you want.

12:31.408 --> 12:32.635
And not just those...

12:32.659 --> 12:34.478
everything that comes in
for the next two months,

12:34.502 --> 12:36.471
I'll do them all.

12:36.472 --> 12:37.803
You really want this trial, don't you?

12:37.827 --> 12:39.563
I really, really do.

12:47.115 --> 12:48.552
I lost.

12:48.576 --> 12:50.428
We lose. That's what we do.

12:50.452 --> 12:52.086
It's because my route was blocked.

12:52.885 --> 12:55.190
- What?
- Construction on my route,

12:55.214 --> 12:57.825
the one I take to hearings every time.

12:58.228 --> 13:00.047
Don't tell me you're one of those lawyers

13:00.071 --> 13:01.715
who believe the same filet of sea bass

13:01.739 --> 13:04.009
served by the same waiter
at the same table

13:04.033 --> 13:06.269
has anything to do with
your success in a courtroom.

13:06.293 --> 13:08.920
Of course not, that's ridiculous.

13:09.927 --> 13:11.536
But if I can't take my route,

13:11.560 --> 13:13.344
I might as well go back to spinning signs

13:13.368 --> 13:14.769
outside Mattress King.

13:14.793 --> 13:17.272
You're a lawyer, not a hobgoblin.

13:17.296 --> 13:18.852
You have no routines whatsoever?

13:18.852 --> 13:20.810
Yes, I do. I move my chair in.

13:20.834 --> 13:21.852
I turn on the light.

13:21.876 --> 13:22.895
I work.

13:22.919 --> 13:24.460
How exactly do you push your chair in?

13:24.484 --> 13:25.849
With my hands.

13:25.873 --> 13:27.066
I can't have this conversation,

13:27.090 --> 13:29.395
because I have a sentencing
in the morning.

13:29.419 --> 13:31.480
I'm going to court in the morning, too.

13:31.504 --> 13:32.877
Can I try your route?

13:32.878 --> 13:34.209
You mean walk with me to court?

13:34.233 --> 13:37.059
Is there a place you consider
a starting point?

13:37.083 --> 13:38.125
My bed.

13:39.090 --> 13:40.270
Don't even.

13:42.297 --> 13:43.906
9:00 sharp.

13:51.485 --> 13:52.851
You know about
foreign policy meetings, right?

13:52.875 --> 13:56.153
My mom is on the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee.

13:56.177 --> 13:58.447
- Yes.
- Okay, cool.

13:58.471 --> 14:01.579
I have this case
involving diplomatic immunity.

14:01.580 --> 14:02.633
Why are you whispering?

14:02.657 --> 14:03.745
I don't know.

14:03.769 --> 14:07.486
Just feels like, you know,
spies and stuff.

14:08.670 --> 14:10.106
I have a meeting
with the State Department,

14:10.130 --> 14:12.435
Main Justice, and the ambassador
of a foreign country...

14:12.459 --> 14:14.034
- Which country?
- Doesn't matter.

14:14.058 --> 14:15.236
An important one.

14:15.935 --> 14:17.474
- Transnistria.
- That's a country?

14:17.498 --> 14:19.387
- Do you have any advice?
- My advice is that the guy who thinks

14:19.411 --> 14:21.298
the Grand Canyon is exotic travel

14:21.322 --> 14:22.549
shouldn't be in this meeting.

14:22.573 --> 14:24.148
Never made it to the Grand Canyon.

14:24.172 --> 14:26.546
I need this meeting. I need this trial.

14:26.570 --> 14:28.944
If this goes to trial, I can
move down to Asset Forfeiture.

14:28.968 --> 14:30.501
Whoa. Hold up.

14:30.925 --> 14:34.377
You nail this meeting
and I get my office back?

14:34.401 --> 14:35.628
Okay. Sit down.

14:35.652 --> 14:37.644
You are going to dominate this meeting,

14:37.668 --> 14:39.487
which requires true gamesmanship.

14:39.511 --> 14:42.127
So you are getting
my best strategic wisdom.

14:42.151 --> 14:44.096
Yes, great. Okay.

14:45.491 --> 14:47.226
Bring handouts.

14:50.177 --> 14:51.821
That's your big move? Handouts?

14:51.845 --> 14:53.733
You're sitting down with bureaucrats,

14:53.757 --> 14:55.297
government drones, who schedule meetings

14:55.321 --> 14:57.070
at 15-minute increments, 10 hours a day,

14:57.094 --> 14:58.737
no time to think let alone prepare.

14:58.761 --> 15:00.684
You put your strongest argument on paper,

15:00.708 --> 15:02.005
you staple it,

15:02.029 --> 15:03.847
and hand it out to everyone in that room,

15:03.871 --> 15:05.679
it doesn't matter what they want
that meeting to be about.

15:05.679 --> 15:08.609
Your handouts drive the agenda.

15:08.633 --> 15:09.756
Handouts.

15:09.780 --> 15:11.411
Never fails.

15:12.526 --> 15:14.865
Madame Ambassador, my name is Roger Gunn.

15:14.889 --> 15:17.125
This is Assistant
Attorney General Hodder,

15:17.149 --> 15:20.250
and you know Assistant Secretary
of State Clive Carrick.

15:20.250 --> 15:21.304
Uh, we're here...

15:21.328 --> 15:22.678
Who is that?

15:24.629 --> 15:26.900
He works in my office.
What are you doing?

15:26.924 --> 15:27.996
Driving the agenda.

15:27.996 --> 15:30.475
Madame Ambassador, as you know,

15:30.499 --> 15:32.595
we are humbly requesting Transnistria

15:32.619 --> 15:35.316
to waive immunity for Mr. Adrian Carpov.

15:35.317 --> 15:37.204
We understand this is
an exceptional request,

15:37.228 --> 15:39.811
but these are exceptional circumstances.

15:39.835 --> 15:42.592
I mean no disrespect to you
or your great nation,

15:42.616 --> 15:46.414
but Mr. Carpov
has repeatedly and flagrantly

15:46.438 --> 15:48.886
violated the norms of civil conduct.

15:48.886 --> 15:50.878
Those are just Mr. Carpov's
reported crimes.

15:50.902 --> 15:52.094
And I hope you don't mind...

15:52.118 --> 15:54.528
I summarized a history
of assaults on page 4,

15:54.552 --> 15:56.023
and there's also an overview

15:56.047 --> 15:58.512
of the illegal gaming on page 5.

16:02.062 --> 16:03.429
I had no idea.

16:03.453 --> 16:05.548
Thank you for bringing this
to our attention.

16:05.572 --> 16:07.495
Of course we'll waive immunity.

16:07.519 --> 16:08.664
Thank you.

16:10.300 --> 16:12.696
Thank you, uh, very much,
Madame Ambassador.

16:13.937 --> 16:15.129
Congratulations, Oliver.

16:15.153 --> 16:17.041
- Yes, congratulations.
- Thank you.

16:17.065 --> 16:18.535
Way to screw that up in there.

16:18.559 --> 16:19.822
Sorry?

16:19.846 --> 16:21.039
They waived immunity.

16:21.063 --> 16:22.290
Of course they waived immunity.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.935
Adrian's crimes are
a PR nightmare for Transnistria.

16:24.959 --> 16:26.514
So they say, "Go ahead, prosecute him,

16:26.515 --> 16:27.499
knowing we never will."

16:27.523 --> 16:28.646
But we will.

16:28.670 --> 16:30.279
But we will not. You will not.

16:30.303 --> 16:31.461
Why not?

16:31.485 --> 16:34.009
Adrian Carpov is
a genuinely horrible person

16:34.010 --> 16:35.515
and a criminal, yes.

16:35.539 --> 16:37.532
But literally on dozens of issues,

16:37.556 --> 16:39.235
he advocates for us to his otherwise

16:39.259 --> 16:41.667
very anti-American prime minister.

16:41.691 --> 16:44.729
Patent law harmonization,
seabird conservation,

16:44.730 --> 16:46.374
disposition of looted gold...

16:46.398 --> 16:47.729
Are we talking about the same guy?

16:47.753 --> 16:50.301
When we're one vote short
at an international summit,

16:50.325 --> 16:52.762
when we need an ally in the Eastern Bloc,

16:52.763 --> 16:55.867
Adrian talks to his
prime minister and gets it done.

16:55.891 --> 16:57.105
Why does he help us?

16:57.106 --> 16:58.159
I don't know.

16:58.183 --> 17:00.036
I think it's because he likes New York

17:00.060 --> 17:02.795
and Cognac and strippers
and free parking.

17:02.795 --> 17:04.058
And I don't care.

17:04.082 --> 17:07.152
I'm sorry about the ATF agent, I am,

17:07.175 --> 17:08.681
but small price to pay.

17:08.704 --> 17:10.837
You care more about
the disposition of looted gold

17:10.838 --> 17:12.239
than the life of a federal agent?

17:12.262 --> 17:15.249
I care about the long-term
interests of the United States.

17:15.250 --> 17:16.582
What are you saying exactly?

17:16.606 --> 17:19.084
I'm saying we need Adrian Carpov.

17:19.108 --> 17:21.864
I'm saying Adrian Carpov
isn't going to jail.

17:21.887 --> 17:24.366
Doesn't matter if Transnistria
waives immunity.

17:24.367 --> 17:27.749
You need Washington's approval
to charge any diplomat,

17:27.772 --> 17:30.531
and we don't approve charges
against Adrian Carpov.

17:35.872 --> 17:38.907
Trans... nistria?

17:38.932 --> 17:42.314
Don't. Just try to relax.

17:42.338 --> 17:44.226
And that's it?

17:44.250 --> 17:45.374
It's over?

17:45.398 --> 17:46.733
He attacked me!

17:46.757 --> 17:47.873
With Cognac!

17:47.897 --> 17:49.544
This is coming down from State.

17:49.568 --> 17:51.108
Justice.

17:51.132 --> 17:52.394
Above all our heads.

17:52.418 --> 17:53.610
If Carpov were anyone else,

17:53.634 --> 17:56.248
we'd prosecute him to
the fullest extent of the law.

17:57.037 --> 17:58.792
I was gonna try this myself.

18:00.026 --> 18:01.913
I can see how disappointed you are.

18:01.937 --> 18:05.876
I-I... I mean, yes.

18:05.900 --> 18:07.162
Yes.

18:07.186 --> 18:08.900
The doctors say the leak
in the lining of my lung

18:08.924 --> 18:10.387
is healing okay.

18:11.322 --> 18:12.897
It's my neck that's the problem.

18:12.921 --> 18:15.678
They call it an atlantoaxial fracture,

18:15.702 --> 18:17.103
high up my spine.

18:17.127 --> 18:18.938
It might never be good as new.

18:19.525 --> 18:21.517
If I can't go back in the field,
that's one thing.

18:21.541 --> 18:25.945
But I keep thinking,
when the baby comes...

18:27.857 --> 18:29.940
will I ever be able to toss him a ball?

18:31.834 --> 18:32.993
I'm sorry.

18:34.157 --> 18:35.836
My case was just dismissed.

18:35.860 --> 18:36.949
Congratulations.

18:36.973 --> 18:38.618
Thrown out entirely.

18:38.642 --> 18:39.661
I'm happy for you.

18:39.685 --> 18:42.511
As in no more case. Oh.

18:42.535 --> 18:43.866
Thanks for spelling that out for me.

18:43.890 --> 18:46.542
Your route is magical,
like some kind of...

18:46.566 --> 18:48.349
yellow brick road.
I hate to break it to you,

18:48.373 --> 18:50.135
but the road has potholes.

18:50.568 --> 18:52.073
I just got killed in there.

18:52.097 --> 18:53.305
What?

18:53.939 --> 18:55.827
You stole Allison's route?

18:55.851 --> 18:57.565
Uh, I thought we could share it.

18:57.589 --> 18:58.712
Share it?

18:58.736 --> 18:59.823
Don't tell me you believe in

18:59.847 --> 19:01.318
these ridiculous superstitions, too.

19:01.342 --> 19:03.021
I believe in the scientific studies

19:03.045 --> 19:04.740
that say rituals reduce anxiety,

19:04.761 --> 19:06.058
make people perform better.

19:06.082 --> 19:09.256
I believe in my decades
of observing, first-hand,

19:09.280 --> 19:13.426
what happens when people break
those rituals or steal them.

19:13.450 --> 19:15.502
What happens when you steal them?

19:15.527 --> 19:16.893
Stephen Somersby.

19:16.918 --> 19:18.562
One of the best litigators in this city.

19:18.587 --> 19:20.683
Never lost a trial in 17 years,

19:20.708 --> 19:23.256
all because of the blue ink
in a single Bic pen

19:23.281 --> 19:25.170
that he carried
in his left breast pocket.

19:25.195 --> 19:26.700
Then, one day, his partner,

19:26.725 --> 19:30.109
who was on a losing streak,
borrows the pen and...

19:30.426 --> 19:33.904
Well, Stephen's happy
making cheese in Vermont.

19:34.566 --> 19:37.448
Just a different life now, you know?

19:39.410 --> 19:40.777
I'm on it, Allison.

19:40.802 --> 19:42.502
I will fix this.

19:43.493 --> 19:45.694
I need your help with something.

19:45.719 --> 19:46.702
Sure.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.094
But I can tell you right now

19:48.119 --> 19:49.554
this conversation is gonna end
with you saying,

19:49.579 --> 19:50.780
"I am coming."

19:50.805 --> 19:51.998
What?

19:52.023 --> 19:53.563
My client in this kidnapping case

19:53.588 --> 19:55.302
mentioned a car theft ring in New Jersey.

19:55.327 --> 19:56.623
If I can show he was working with them,

19:56.648 --> 19:58.397
I might be able to undermine
the government's argument

19:58.422 --> 20:00.035
- about intent...
- Waste of time.

20:00.060 --> 20:01.147
It's three guys and a drill,

20:01.172 --> 20:02.395
and none of them are willing to talk.

20:02.420 --> 20:03.647
Have you been working this case?

20:03.672 --> 20:05.715
- You said you needed my help.
- That was, like, 10 seconds ago.

20:05.729 --> 20:08.197
- I work quickly.
- Why are you working this case?

20:08.222 --> 20:10.595
Have you checked out the timeline?

20:10.620 --> 20:12.265
Nico was arrested about two hours

20:12.290 --> 20:14.352
after the baby
was reported missing in Inwood.

20:14.377 --> 20:15.846
But according to your interview notes,

20:15.871 --> 20:18.559
he said he stole the car
three hours before his arrest.

20:18.584 --> 20:20.471
Now, this is all happening
in the wee hours,

20:20.496 --> 20:21.897
when people tend to be fuzzy,

20:21.922 --> 20:24.470
but we could be looking
at a one-hour discrepancy.

20:24.495 --> 20:26.106
You think Nico might be lying?

20:26.131 --> 20:27.691
- People lie.
- Where are you going?

20:27.716 --> 20:28.943
I'm going up to Inwood.

20:28.968 --> 20:30.752
- I'm coming with you.
- That's not how I work.

20:30.777 --> 20:31.830
That's how I work.

20:31.855 --> 20:32.874
I'm coming.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.426
I. Am. Coming.

20:35.901 --> 20:37.463
Damn it.

20:43.521 --> 20:45.235
This ATF agent's really beaten up...

20:45.259 --> 20:46.591
fractured neck, busted lung.

20:46.615 --> 20:48.676
You told Roger this isn't my case, right?

20:48.700 --> 20:50.727
I'm talking about a human being here,

20:50.751 --> 20:52.216
who is really injured.

20:54.738 --> 20:56.869
He would have made such a good witness.

20:56.894 --> 20:59.233
- You're just thinking about your trial!
- No!

20:59.258 --> 21:01.236
I'm thinking about a guy
who needs justice

21:01.261 --> 21:03.705
and can also move a jury
to give it at trial.

21:03.730 --> 21:05.479
- You're horrible.
- You're horrible.

21:05.504 --> 21:06.870
Do you have an estimate
for getting out of here?

21:06.895 --> 21:08.539
- Oh, so insensitive!
- Horrible!

21:08.564 --> 21:10.950
What? Oh, you messed this up, didn't you?

21:10.975 --> 21:14.009
Yeah, you know, your "handouts"
weren't exactly magical.

21:14.034 --> 21:15.087
I knew you'd mess this up.

21:15.112 --> 21:16.167
The handouts are magical!

21:16.192 --> 21:17.975
The handouts drive the agenda!

21:18.000 --> 21:19.401
The handouts tell people what to think!

21:21.339 --> 21:23.228
The handouts!

21:23.253 --> 21:24.722
- What are we doing?
- Just wait.

21:24.747 --> 21:25.906
- For what?
- Just wait.

21:25.931 --> 21:27.366
Did you know that under New York law,

21:27.391 --> 21:29.404
a burrito is considered a sandwich?

21:30.179 --> 21:32.693
- Food law.
- New York Times is live.

21:32.727 --> 21:35.553
- ABC News. HuffPo!
- With what?

21:35.577 --> 21:37.672
...worst abuses of diplomatic immunity

21:37.696 --> 21:39.271
in the city's history,

21:39.295 --> 21:42.087
a newly leaked report on Adrian Carpov,

21:42.111 --> 21:43.998
a consular official from
the Republic of Transnistria...

21:44.022 --> 21:45.145
I called a dozen reporters

21:45.169 --> 21:46.694
and gave them copies of the handout.

21:46.695 --> 21:48.617
With all of the abuse,
there will be such outrage,

21:48.641 --> 21:50.321
it'll be impossible to ignore.

21:50.345 --> 21:52.664
And, since I passed out all
of those copies at the meeting,

21:52.664 --> 21:54.169
no one will know who leaked it!

21:54.193 --> 21:55.456
The handout!

21:55.480 --> 21:56.777
I am going to trial.

21:56.801 --> 21:58.480
I am going to Asset Forfeiture.

21:58.504 --> 22:00.043
And you are going to my office.

22:00.067 --> 22:02.024
- Did you tell Roger?
- Not yet.

22:02.048 --> 22:04.075
Hmm, you may want to mention it.

22:11.637 --> 22:13.490
I can explain about the handouts.

22:13.514 --> 22:14.637
Leonard... Brilliant.

22:14.661 --> 22:15.957
Excuse me?

22:15.981 --> 22:17.869
Just got the green light
on your prosecution.

22:17.893 --> 22:19.607
With the press on Carpov's crime spree,

22:19.631 --> 22:21.032
State and Justice caved.

22:21.056 --> 22:22.562
They would have looked weak
if they hadn't.

22:22.586 --> 22:24.959
I thought your handouts were moronic,

22:24.983 --> 22:26.767
but they turned out
to be a stroke of genius.

22:26.791 --> 22:28.400
This is what I've been trying
to tell Leonard.

22:28.424 --> 22:29.791
FBI is gonna make an arrest.

22:29.815 --> 22:31.876
You are gonna avenge that ATF agent.

22:31.900 --> 22:33.057
And I am gonna release you

22:33.081 --> 22:34.900
from having to do
any more of these mark-ups.

22:34.924 --> 22:36.833
Nice work, Oliver.

22:40.380 --> 22:41.955
That's where Nico stole the car,

22:41.979 --> 22:43.312
and that's the bodega

22:43.336 --> 22:45.496
where the baby's father
grabbed some coffee.

22:51.677 --> 22:52.904
What are you doing?

22:52.928 --> 22:54.264
Watching.

22:54.265 --> 22:55.804
Watching what?

22:55.828 --> 22:57.459
The neighborhood.

23:08.396 --> 23:10.020
Do you see anything?

23:10.901 --> 23:12.469
I see your lips moving.

23:12.494 --> 23:13.917
Oh.

23:16.549 --> 23:19.653
We should get out there,
talk to some people.

23:20.043 --> 23:21.062
Do something.

23:21.087 --> 23:22.524
We are doing something.

23:22.549 --> 23:23.810
We're watching, all right?

23:23.835 --> 23:26.661
You learn more by watching than talking.

23:26.686 --> 23:29.461
- Did you ever watch "Sesame Street"?
- Yes.

23:29.486 --> 23:30.714
- Did you learn anything?
- Yes.

23:30.739 --> 23:32.036
Were you talking the whole time?

23:32.061 --> 23:33.844
Yes. I didn't like the bird.

23:33.869 --> 23:35.583
- The bird.
- Freaked me out. Yes, the bird...

23:35.608 --> 23:36.939
the... you know, the big bird and...

23:36.964 --> 23:38.713
- You mean Big Bird.
- Yes.

23:38.738 --> 23:41.182
See, now we're talking and not watching

23:41.207 --> 23:44.020
when we should be watching.

23:56.552 --> 23:59.136
I thought I gave the arson case to Merri.

23:59.161 --> 24:00.770
Jay took my route to the courthouse,

24:00.795 --> 24:03.621
and now he thinks
that because he won and I lost,

24:03.646 --> 24:05.242
I'm "cursed"!

24:05.393 --> 24:07.489
You gave up your route?

24:07.514 --> 24:09.599
I mean, I let Jay walk with me, but...

24:09.624 --> 24:12.346
Oh, that's why you got
the crazy Harnett sentencing.

24:12.371 --> 24:14.989
I mean, I'd say it was
more about a horrible judge...

24:15.014 --> 24:17.040
And why Jay's case got dismissed!

24:17.065 --> 24:18.257
This isn't good.

24:18.282 --> 24:19.927
Am I being pranked today?

24:19.952 --> 24:22.256
The last time this happened
was Joseph Wadell,

24:22.281 --> 24:23.612
the Public Defender before me.

24:23.637 --> 24:25.804
He lost his special tie,

24:25.856 --> 24:28.161
and he heard the U.S. Attorney
had this lucky ritual,

24:28.186 --> 24:29.782
so he tried to take it.

24:29.783 --> 24:30.976
I can't remember...

24:31.000 --> 24:32.331
Who are you calling?

24:32.355 --> 24:34.034
- This is Roger.
- Yeah, you're on speaker.

24:34.058 --> 24:36.814
What did Wadell take from Hammond?

24:36.838 --> 24:38.795
Oh, right, yeah.

24:38.819 --> 24:40.082
Uh, Hammond used to work his dog's name

24:40.106 --> 24:41.958
- into every closing.
- That's crazy.

24:41.982 --> 24:43.070
Well, it worked for Hammond.

24:43.094 --> 24:44.321
Then Wadell started doing it,

24:44.345 --> 24:46.164
and Hammond started losing. A lot.

24:46.188 --> 24:48.006
Hammond started drinking,
Wadell was hit by a train...

24:48.030 --> 24:51.007
- Okay, we got it.
- Thank you.

24:51.008 --> 24:52.374
I'll admit.

24:52.398 --> 24:55.537
It's disconcerting that
so many smart people I respect

24:55.561 --> 24:56.580
believe in this stuff.

24:56.604 --> 24:57.761
We've already got the firepower

24:57.785 --> 24:59.325
of the federal government against us.

24:59.349 --> 25:01.840
We can't take on an angry universe, too.

25:02.265 --> 25:04.083
I hope he comes up with something.

25:17.314 --> 25:19.201
- So?
- So?

25:19.225 --> 25:21.670
So, I talked to two guys
around the corner

25:21.694 --> 25:24.033
who said there have been
a lot of car thefts in the area,

25:24.057 --> 25:26.140
but they don't recall anything
from that night.

25:27.877 --> 25:29.278
And I went to the Mister Softee truck,

25:29.303 --> 25:30.321
but he wouldn't talk to me

25:30.346 --> 25:31.853
unless I bought an ice cream sandwich.

25:31.878 --> 25:33.705
And?

25:34.115 --> 25:36.037
Bought an ice cream sandwich,

25:36.062 --> 25:38.297
but he didn't have any information.

25:38.322 --> 25:40.349
Okay, cool.

25:40.374 --> 25:42.018
- Seatbelt.
- What?

25:42.043 --> 25:43.305
We're done here.

25:43.330 --> 25:45.218
But we didn't turn up anything.

25:45.243 --> 25:46.435
You haven't turned up anything.

25:46.460 --> 25:47.861
You haven't even left the car!

25:47.886 --> 25:49.912
I didn't need to leave the car.

25:49.937 --> 25:51.287
You see that doorway right there?

25:51.312 --> 25:53.304
11 people have gone in
that doorway since you left,

25:53.329 --> 25:55.147
and I would say roughly 11 out of 11

25:55.172 --> 25:56.295
don't live in this neighborhood.

25:56.320 --> 25:58.271
Which means...?

25:58.562 --> 25:59.859
It's a drug den.

25:59.884 --> 26:01.538
Which means...?

26:01.914 --> 26:03.527
The dad's a user.

26:04.511 --> 26:06.843
Left his kid in the car, went in,

26:06.868 --> 26:09.207
got high, forgot about his baby.

26:09.232 --> 26:13.657
Nico comes by,
sees this nice car, jacks it.

26:13.682 --> 26:14.871
Which means...?

26:16.544 --> 26:19.462
Which means I get the ice cream sandwich.

26:26.857 --> 26:28.969
Still waiting for word on this arrest.

26:32.418 --> 26:36.148
But I just want to say,
now that I'll be leaving,

26:36.172 --> 26:38.270
I really appreciate your help with this.

26:39.075 --> 26:41.101
And I realize you have your headphones in

26:41.126 --> 26:44.092
and aren't listening
to a word I'm saying.

26:44.117 --> 26:47.029
But you've been a great friend to me,

26:48.299 --> 26:52.534
and I honestly can't imagine

26:53.333 --> 26:56.227
how I would have done
this job without you.

26:56.252 --> 26:57.793
Or your office.

27:01.781 --> 27:04.107
Mr. Oliver. I think you want to see this.

27:07.548 --> 27:09.471
- What am I watching?
- That's Carpov.

27:09.496 --> 27:11.279
No. No!

27:11.304 --> 27:13.457
What? What?

27:13.482 --> 27:15.960
Where's he going? Why are they stopping?

27:15.985 --> 27:17.838
...fled from the Transnistrian Consulate

27:17.863 --> 27:20.759
and taken refuge in the
neighboring Cordoban Embassy...

27:20.784 --> 27:22.637
- Cordoba?!
- Really impressive speed.

27:22.662 --> 27:23.819
Why didn't the FBI follow him in?

27:23.844 --> 27:25.003
- Why didn't they arrest him?
- Can't.

27:25.028 --> 27:26.387
That embassy is basically foreign soil.

27:26.412 --> 27:28.126
The FBI can't set foot in there
without permission.

27:28.151 --> 27:29.273
No one can.

27:29.298 --> 27:30.769
If Cordoba grants him
diplomatic asylum...

27:30.794 --> 27:32.091
and given our history with Cordoba,

27:32.116 --> 27:33.135
I'm sure they will...

27:33.160 --> 27:34.839
Carpov can stay in there forever,

27:34.864 --> 27:35.883
and we can't get to him.

27:35.908 --> 27:38.143
Here. Giving these back to you.

27:43.905 --> 27:45.188
I hate the world.

27:46.418 --> 27:47.541
- Cut the power?
- No.

27:47.565 --> 27:49.307
- The water?
- No. Those are acts of war.

27:49.332 --> 27:51.174
How did they get Assange
out of the Ecuadorian embassy?

27:51.199 --> 27:52.727
- He's not out.
- He's not out?

27:52.752 --> 27:53.735
It's been, like, six years.

27:53.759 --> 27:54.952
Do you know it's illegal in New York

27:54.976 --> 27:56.807
to take a selfie with a tiger?

27:57.636 --> 27:58.740
Okay. Listen.

27:58.764 --> 28:01.382
We sneak in and pull the fire alarm.

28:01.406 --> 28:03.155
How are you gonna sneak into an embassy?

28:03.179 --> 28:07.031
I will pose as a pizza delivery man.

28:07.056 --> 28:08.422
Okay. So, I take the pizza on the porch.

28:08.447 --> 28:09.431
Thank you. Close the door.

28:09.456 --> 28:10.787
Wait. See, you don't,

28:10.812 --> 28:14.508
'cause I say, "Sir, excuse me,
I am bleeding.

28:14.533 --> 28:16.316
- Do you have a Band-Aid?"
- Are you bleeding?

28:16.341 --> 28:17.672
Yes, I will cut myself.

28:17.697 --> 28:19.069
- How much blood?
- Enough. A lot.

28:19.094 --> 28:20.461
So you're dripping blood
all over the pizzas?

28:20.486 --> 28:21.644
No, I don't want the pizzas now.

28:21.669 --> 28:22.861
Goodbye. Close the door.

28:22.886 --> 28:24.252
Wait, what did you say?

28:24.277 --> 28:26.026
It's illegal to take a selfie
with a tiger.

28:26.051 --> 28:27.807
Or any large cat... That's it.

28:27.832 --> 28:29.059
We get him to take a selfie with a tiger?

28:29.084 --> 28:30.381
No way. I saw "The Hangover."

28:30.406 --> 28:32.398
Listen, why do people
take selfies with tigers?

28:32.423 --> 28:34.554
Well, who else
is gonna take that picture?

28:34.579 --> 28:36.814
They do it because people do stupid stuff

28:36.839 --> 28:37.858
for the things they want.

28:37.883 --> 28:38.936
They take huge risks.

28:38.961 --> 28:40.119
So what does Carpov want?

28:40.144 --> 28:41.494
Carpov wants...

28:41.519 --> 28:42.658
- A tiger.
- Ibiza.

28:42.683 --> 28:43.737
Cognac.

28:43.762 --> 28:45.697
Carpov is obsessed with Cognac.

28:45.722 --> 28:47.749
He goes to Cognac tastings
all over the world.

28:47.774 --> 28:49.731
Cognac is his Achilles' heel.

28:49.756 --> 28:53.486
So we lure him out with Cognac.

28:53.511 --> 28:55.595
How do we do that?

28:57.057 --> 28:58.424
Mm.

28:58.449 --> 28:59.537
Why do I have to be here?

28:59.562 --> 29:01.554
I can't walk BB into this place alo.

29:03.832 --> 29:04.921
Dwayne Darnell?

29:04.946 --> 29:06.555
Yes? This is Kate Littlejohn.

29:06.580 --> 29:08.336
I'm Seth Oliver.

29:09.497 --> 29:11.003
Too old.

29:11.028 --> 29:13.020
We're from the United States
Attorney's Office.

29:13.045 --> 29:14.342
I don't care what the act is.

29:14.367 --> 29:15.976
We're federal prosecutors

29:16.001 --> 29:18.584
with the United States Attorney's Office.

29:18.609 --> 29:20.810
We want to talk to you
about Adrian Carpov.

29:20.835 --> 29:22.309
Never heard of him.

29:22.334 --> 29:24.187
You know, that sign out front?
"Rear Window."

29:24.212 --> 29:25.683
- It's beautiful.
- Thank you.

29:25.708 --> 29:27.560
Yeah, except those are 4-foot letters.

29:27.585 --> 29:30.168
New York law mandates 39-inch letters

29:30.193 --> 29:32.289
for anything hanging more
than 4 feet over the street.

29:32.314 --> 29:33.993
Now, that's New York State law,

29:34.018 --> 29:35.627
and I'm a federal prosecutor,

29:35.652 --> 29:36.949
so I can't do anything about it.

29:36.974 --> 29:38.237
But I can refer it.

29:38.262 --> 29:41.227
Also, your condiments need
to be single-serving.

29:41.252 --> 29:42.271
Shall I keep going?

29:42.296 --> 29:43.349
What do you want?

29:43.374 --> 29:45.505
Adrian Carpov is into Cognac, right?

29:45.530 --> 29:46.514
Does a hobby horse have a wooden...

29:46.539 --> 29:47.731
You know what? Let's just...

29:47.756 --> 29:50.121
What Cognac is Adrian
always talking about?

29:50.146 --> 29:51.825
Like, the one.

29:51.850 --> 29:54.780
That if he could taste it,
he would die happy?

29:54.805 --> 29:59.321
I mean, a Croizet Cuvée Léonie,
but that's $150,000 bottle.

29:59.346 --> 30:00.608
It... It's impossible to find.

30:00.633 --> 30:02.208
- I've never seen one.
- Yes, you have.

30:02.233 --> 30:03.877
In fact, you have one right now

30:03.902 --> 30:07.042
and it's open and he has to taste it.

30:15.574 --> 30:16.975
You're in here a lot, yes?

30:17.000 --> 30:18.958
What? No, I-I've never...

30:18.983 --> 30:20.280
I'm joking. I'm joking.

30:30.200 --> 30:31.567
I've never been in that place in my life.

30:31.592 --> 30:32.771
Not once.

30:36.438 --> 30:39.333
You made up all that stuff
about the sign, didn't you?

30:39.357 --> 30:41.836
I'm not a strip club girl.

30:48.811 --> 30:50.420
This guy's smart. He'll send a test car,

30:50.444 --> 30:52.297
see if we bite.

31:09.631 --> 31:11.310
That's our guy.

31:13.944 --> 31:16.562
- FBI! Don't move!
- Get on the ground!

31:24.945 --> 31:27.667
See? Not a problem.

31:31.440 --> 31:33.085
The baby's father, Gregory Winston,

31:33.110 --> 31:35.240
wasn't a weary parent
trying to help his child sleep.

31:35.265 --> 31:37.883
He's a high-functioning addict
who used his baby as cover

31:37.908 --> 31:39.379
so he could leave his house
and score drugs.

31:39.404 --> 31:40.596
You have proof of this?

31:40.621 --> 31:42.057
Closed-circuit camera
from outside the door

31:42.082 --> 31:43.571
of the pawn shop across the street.

31:43.596 --> 31:45.136
Car was parked for almost an hour,

31:45.161 --> 31:46.909
drives away,
presumably when it was stolen,

31:46.934 --> 31:48.474
and yet it was another hour

31:48.499 --> 31:50.492
before Winston came out
and called the police.

31:50.517 --> 31:52.628
Temperatures that night dipped
into the low-40s.

31:52.629 --> 31:54.968
A 3-month-old baby, left outside
for that length of time,

31:54.992 --> 31:56.845
most likely would die of hypothermia.

31:56.869 --> 31:59.035
We also have Nico's
Internet search history.

31:59.059 --> 32:00.356
"Where to drop off baby,"

32:00.380 --> 32:02.337
"give back baby, no questions asked,"

32:02.361 --> 32:03.692
"safe baby surrender,"

32:03.716 --> 32:05.940
addresses of nearby
fire stations and hospitals...

32:05.941 --> 32:07.306
Clear evidence of lack of intent.

32:07.330 --> 32:08.454
Nico was trying to figure out

32:08.478 --> 32:09.948
how to return the child to her parents.

32:09.972 --> 32:11.408
The kidnapping was a mistake,

32:11.432 --> 32:13.480
but he probably saved that baby's life.

32:14.560 --> 32:16.934
I'll need to review this
with the investigating agents,

32:16.958 --> 32:18.143
but if it holds up,

32:18.144 --> 32:19.614
we'll dismiss the kidnapping charges.

32:19.638 --> 32:22.047
He might still face auto theft
with the State.

32:22.071 --> 32:23.538
What about the baby?

32:23.562 --> 32:24.723
What about the baby?

32:24.747 --> 32:26.452
Well, the baby's dad is a user

32:26.452 --> 32:27.506
who left her in the car.

32:27.530 --> 32:29.314
Yes, you just told me that.

32:29.338 --> 32:30.913
Are you gonna prosecute the father?

32:30.937 --> 32:32.094
If he made a false statement...

32:32.118 --> 32:34.562
What about the baby?
I'm asking about the baby.

32:34.586 --> 32:36.156
That's not our jurisdiction. Sandra?

32:36.156 --> 32:37.349
Why don't we focus on Nico...

32:37.373 --> 32:39.018
Hold on. I'm asking you...

32:39.042 --> 32:41.728
No, you hold on.
Don't raise your voice with me.

32:41.752 --> 32:43.327
That baby is not safe.

32:46.151 --> 32:47.898
What the hell are you doing?

32:47.922 --> 32:50.158
Look, I'm trying to protect that child.

32:50.182 --> 32:52.000
We are negotiating a deal for our client.

32:52.024 --> 32:53.112
That is why we are here.

32:53.136 --> 32:55.129
I will talk to her about the child after.

32:55.153 --> 32:57.631
He left his daughter alone in a car,

32:57.655 --> 32:58.673
in the middle of the night.

32:58.697 --> 33:00.168
I know what he did. I know.

33:00.192 --> 33:01.941
- He doesn't deserve to be a father.
- Ted...

33:01.965 --> 33:03.697
Where will she be
the next time he takes a hit?

33:03.697 --> 33:04.716
In the bathtub?

33:04.740 --> 33:06.105
Face down in her crib?

33:06.129 --> 33:08.747
Someone has to protect her.

33:18.712 --> 33:20.251
So it was really all about the handout.

33:21.736 --> 33:22.946
Special reserve.

33:22.970 --> 33:24.026
Ah.

33:24.050 --> 33:25.446
Cognac.

33:25.470 --> 33:27.470
From Duane Reade.

33:27.494 --> 33:28.958
Best I could do on short notice.

33:30.144 --> 33:31.564
Well done, Oliver.

33:31.589 --> 33:32.886
This has been a crazy ride,

33:32.911 --> 33:34.868
so if you want to tag in
someone else to try the case...

33:34.893 --> 33:37.480
No. No, I'd like to keep it
through trial.

33:41.888 --> 33:43.497
Just heard from my mom that Transnistria

33:43.522 --> 33:46.314
gave up its seat on the Trans-Atlantic
Fisheries Technology Conference.

33:46.339 --> 33:47.392
Which means?

33:47.417 --> 33:49.130
- Nothing, probably.
- Exactly.

33:49.155 --> 33:51.327
Well, worst case it means war.

33:51.894 --> 33:54.998
I'm saying worst case.

33:55.023 --> 33:57.433
See, up to this point, we've
always convinced Transnistria

33:57.458 --> 33:58.997
to vote with the Scandinavian countries

33:59.022 --> 34:00.285
on fisheries policy

34:00.310 --> 34:01.850
in exchange for Scandinavian votes

34:01.875 --> 34:03.763
on ballast water
and sediments management.

34:03.788 --> 34:05.817
I'm deep into Maritime Law now.

34:05.842 --> 34:07.069
Only four hours to go.

34:07.094 --> 34:10.029
Anyway, this all matters a lot
to China...

34:10.054 --> 34:12.428
all the shipping
and anti-fouling issues do...

34:12.453 --> 34:15.118
which is how we get China
to pressure Russia

34:15.143 --> 34:17.482
on the Bunker Oil Pollution Protocol,

34:17.507 --> 34:19.568
which gets the whole European Union

34:19.592 --> 34:23.359
to help us keep Moldova
from attacking Transnistria.

34:23.384 --> 34:24.784
Attacking Transnistria?

34:24.810 --> 34:26.835
Maritime law is
really complicated, though.

34:26.860 --> 34:28.804
And the lecturer had
a thick French accent,

34:28.830 --> 34:31.996
so I don't think it's anything
to get worked up over.

34:33.036 --> 34:34.681
The important thing is
that you're going to trial.

34:39.504 --> 34:41.266
- I'm still working on a fix.
- I know.

34:41.291 --> 34:42.585
As of now, it looks like we're gonna have

34:42.610 --> 34:45.112
to sacrifice a goat here in
Foley Square on the new moon.

34:45.137 --> 34:47.112
You'd keep the goat head in
your office for three weeks...

34:47.138 --> 34:48.226
Peter!

34:48.250 --> 34:50.554
Is that Peter Daum?

34:50.578 --> 34:52.603
- Yes.
- The Peter Daum?

34:52.628 --> 34:54.868
Yes. The greatest trial lawyer

34:54.893 --> 34:56.775
of his generation Peter Daum?

34:56.800 --> 34:57.823
Yes!

34:57.847 --> 34:58.862
Peter.

35:00.169 --> 35:01.731
Thank you for coming.

35:02.728 --> 35:05.694
Peter, this is my colleague, Jay Simmons.

35:05.719 --> 35:06.738
Jay, this is...

35:06.763 --> 35:09.280
Peter Daum. It's a real honor, sir.

35:10.477 --> 35:12.399
I'm dead, right?

35:12.424 --> 35:13.686
But somehow I made it to lawyer heaven,

35:13.711 --> 35:16.433
and you are greeting me.

35:16.458 --> 35:18.242
Mr. Simmons.

35:18.267 --> 35:19.772
You're not dead.

35:19.797 --> 35:21.476
Yet.

35:21.501 --> 35:22.658
But Allison does tell me

35:22.683 --> 35:24.921
you're having some trouble
with your route.

35:25.573 --> 35:27.950
I'd like to offer mine.

35:27.975 --> 35:29.168
What?

35:29.193 --> 35:32.595
I've had the same route here
for 47 years,

35:33.601 --> 35:35.142
and it's served me well.

35:35.167 --> 35:37.183
But I'm retired now.

35:37.883 --> 35:41.020
I tried my last case two weeks ago...

35:41.873 --> 35:44.387
I won...

35:44.412 --> 35:46.751
And, uh, I...

35:46.776 --> 35:49.862
well, I don't have any use
for it anymore.

35:50.761 --> 35:51.779
If you're interested...

35:51.804 --> 35:54.492
Yes. O-Of course.

35:54.517 --> 35:55.635
Thank you!

35:55.660 --> 36:00.362
Meet me here at 7:37 tomorrow morning.

36:00.387 --> 36:02.344
On the northwest corner.

36:02.369 --> 36:04.294
You'll need brown shoes,

36:04.807 --> 36:06.938
a nickel from 1971,

36:06.963 --> 36:10.310
a very small can of sardines.

36:10.335 --> 36:12.049
Do not brush your hair,

36:12.074 --> 36:16.556
and do not urinate
before leaving your house.

36:17.339 --> 36:18.850
Okay?

36:19.394 --> 36:21.663
See you tomorrow.

36:21.721 --> 36:23.470
Bye, Al.

36:23.495 --> 36:25.090
Thanks, Peter!

36:30.490 --> 36:31.682
How?

36:31.707 --> 36:33.408
Old family friend.

36:35.130 --> 36:37.922
It took me a while, but I get it now.

36:37.946 --> 36:40.181
All these superstitions.

36:40.205 --> 36:43.552
We have so little control
over what happens

36:43.576 --> 36:45.494
to the people we work so hard to protect,

36:45.494 --> 36:47.556
and it's so stressful,

36:47.580 --> 36:49.224
and it makes sense
that everyone is looking

36:49.248 --> 36:50.928
for some order to things.

36:50.952 --> 36:55.793
Something that explains this win
or justifies that loss.

36:55.817 --> 36:57.913
Something that feels like control

36:57.937 --> 36:59.998
over an input and outcome that,

37:00.022 --> 37:03.579
in so many ways, for so many reasons,

37:03.603 --> 37:05.095
we do not control.

37:06.977 --> 37:08.308
I hope the sardines help.

37:19.296 --> 37:21.183
Celia dropped the kidnapping charge.

37:21.208 --> 37:23.200
The State's letting Nico
plead down to probation.

37:23.225 --> 37:26.399
He is beyond grateful.

37:26.424 --> 37:27.581
Okay.

37:27.606 --> 37:29.633
Celia also arranged a visit
to the child's parents

37:29.658 --> 37:30.815
by Children's Services.

37:30.840 --> 37:33.041
The dad voluntarily entered
a treatment facility,

37:33.066 --> 37:36.052
which means the baby can stay
in the mother's custody.

37:36.769 --> 37:40.082
Look, I know you've seen me
act less than restrained.

37:40.107 --> 37:41.716
I understand. But what happened today...

37:41.741 --> 37:43.546
I had a son.

37:47.384 --> 37:49.711
I had a son.

37:52.322 --> 37:53.515
I'm sorry about today.

38:03.283 --> 38:06.770
Protocol on the Suppression
of Violence at Airports.

38:06.794 --> 38:10.106
The International Convention
on Civil Liability

38:10.130 --> 38:12.191
for Oil Pollution Damage.

38:12.215 --> 38:14.207
Are you having the world's
nerdiest stroke?

38:14.231 --> 38:16.919
The Convention on Early Notification

38:16.943 --> 38:18.308
on a Nuclear Accident.

38:18.332 --> 38:19.959
And I, for one, do not want
to be notified late.

38:19.983 --> 38:21.099
What are these?

38:21.123 --> 38:23.359
They're agreements we made
with Transnistria,

38:23.383 --> 38:26.718
issues that idiot Carpov helped to sway.

38:26.718 --> 38:29.649
The domino effect of that
fisheries thing is just a start.

38:29.673 --> 38:30.691
State thinks they could walk out

38:30.715 --> 38:32.429
on a big cyber-terror agreement next,

38:32.453 --> 38:33.854
which I'm sure you'll now tell me

38:33.878 --> 38:35.801
is the beginning of the apocalypse.

38:35.825 --> 38:37.990
You know that scenario I described?

38:38.014 --> 38:41.749
That was just... hypothetical.

38:41.749 --> 38:44.019
There's uncertainty in everything we do,

38:44.043 --> 38:45.166
in every direction,

38:45.190 --> 38:47.703
a cascade of unintended consequences.

38:47.727 --> 38:49.960
You could try this case
and start a nuclear war.

38:49.960 --> 38:51.256
Or you could let Carpov go

38:51.280 --> 38:53.759
and he could start a nuclear war.

38:53.783 --> 38:57.478
You can only control
what you can control.

38:57.502 --> 38:58.938
So focus on that.

38:58.962 --> 39:00.189
What do you want to do?

39:00.213 --> 39:02.517
What do you think is right?

39:36.515 --> 39:38.090
Congratulations.

39:39.157 --> 39:42.536
- I'm not gonna prosecute him.
- What?

39:42.560 --> 39:44.659
The State Department
is releasing a joint statement

39:44.683 --> 39:47.720
with the Transnistrian Ministry
of Foreign Affairs as we speak.

39:47.721 --> 39:49.434
Carpov will return to Transnistria

39:49.458 --> 39:51.242
for prosecution at home.

39:51.266 --> 39:52.841
They won't prosecute him at home.

39:52.865 --> 39:54.357
Probably not, no.

39:55.168 --> 39:56.741
I'm sorry.

39:56.765 --> 39:57.924
I wanted to prosecute him,

39:57.948 --> 39:59.835
but my job is to serve the interests

39:59.859 --> 40:02.303
of this government as a whole,

40:02.327 --> 40:06.786
complicated and messy
and imperfect as they are.

40:07.428 --> 40:09.560
This time that means
letting a bad guy go.

40:11.495 --> 40:13.348
I'd be more pissed off
if I didn't just hear

40:13.372 --> 40:15.461
my spine is looking better.

40:15.944 --> 40:17.515
You're probably doing the right thing.

40:17.516 --> 40:19.091
I better be.

40:19.115 --> 40:22.079
This trial was supposed to get
me a job in Asset Forfeiture,

40:22.103 --> 40:23.504
and now that job is gone.

40:23.528 --> 40:24.825
Asset Forfeiture?

40:24.849 --> 40:26.668
No action there.

40:26.692 --> 40:28.427
I think you dodged a bullet.

40:31.110 --> 40:35.153
But. If you're looking for a trial,

40:35.177 --> 40:36.821
I was in that strip club for a reason.

40:39.401 --> 40:41.184
Your Honor, as alleged in the complaint,

40:41.208 --> 40:43.826
and as set forth
in the attached affidavit

40:43.850 --> 40:45.563
prepared by ATF Agent Carney,

40:45.587 --> 40:47.266
the defendant, Dwayne Darnell,

40:47.290 --> 40:50.217
oversees a sophisticated
alcohol smuggling operation

40:50.217 --> 40:52.765
through his gentleman's club,
Rear Window.

40:52.789 --> 40:55.267
In addition to
the alcohol smuggling counts,

40:55.291 --> 40:57.906
Mr. Darnell is being charged
with racketeering

40:57.907 --> 41:00.907
for coordination with
organized crime in this scheme.

41:00.931 --> 41:02.922
Thank you, Mr. Oliver.

41:02.946 --> 41:05.428
When can the government be ready
for trial?

41:06.333 --> 41:08.499
I'm ready now, Your Honor.
