[dramatic music continues]

00:50.267 --> 00:51.660
[Erin] I'm Erin.

00:52.617 --> 00:53.879
I'm an addict.

00:55.925 --> 00:57.318
Checking in with myself,

00:57.361 --> 01:00.973
I haven't had
the best week ever.

01:02.845 --> 01:06.196
I had a pretty major screw-up
at work.

01:07.241 --> 01:08.720
It's totally my fault.

01:09.112 --> 01:12.333
I, uh... can't blame
anyone but myself.

01:13.682 --> 01:18.078
And, um, I feel... embarrassed.

01:18.121 --> 01:21.733
I feel...
disappointed in myself.

01:23.866 --> 01:26.651
And I have that voice that says,

01:26.695 --> 01:30.829
you know, "You're a failure.
You'll always be a failure."

01:32.179 --> 01:37.445
And it's like, God,
if I could just have something.

01:38.054 --> 01:39.360
You know, anything.

01:40.056 --> 01:42.102
To help get me out
of my own head.

01:43.146 --> 01:45.714
A glass of wine, maybe.
You know?

01:46.541 --> 01:48.064
Just one glass.

01:48.890 --> 01:50.936
What's that gonna hurt?
[chuckles softly]

01:52.634 --> 01:56.289
My career, my relationship.

01:58.205 --> 02:00.642
That's what that one glass
would hurt.

02:00.685 --> 02:02.818
And it hit me. You know?

02:02.861 --> 02:05.473
I have so much to lose.

02:07.779 --> 02:10.565
And that used to scare me,
but now I, uh...

02:12.219 --> 02:15.613
I realize how lucky I am
to say that.

02:18.529 --> 02:22.881
My mom, my sister, my ex.

02:23.621 --> 02:25.841
They all think I'm crazy,
but, uh...

02:27.364 --> 02:29.540
my partner doesn't and...

02:31.151 --> 02:32.674
I'm grateful for that.

02:34.632 --> 02:38.027
And I'm grateful for all of you.

02:39.463 --> 02:41.552
I'm grateful for today.

02:43.511 --> 02:44.773
[whispering] Thanks.

02:49.212 --> 02:53.129
Um, hi, I'm Will,
and I'm an addict.

02:54.522 --> 02:55.827
Um...

02:56.567 --> 03:00.832
[stammers] I'm doing okay,
actually. Um...

03:02.269 --> 03:03.618
All right,

03:03.661 --> 03:06.011
I felt like sharing today
because, uh,

03:07.230 --> 03:11.103
I've had a pretty big change
in my life, recently.

03:11.408 --> 03:14.194
Um, I've met someone.

03:15.760 --> 03:17.109
And...

03:18.285 --> 03:21.940
[stammers] I wasn't
expecting it, but...

03:23.159 --> 03:25.466
Now I'm starting to feel
like I can...

03:27.946 --> 03:29.905
at least, see a future with her.

03:29.948 --> 03:30.993
Um...

03:33.038 --> 03:34.430
Yeah. [chuckles softly]

03:36.085 --> 03:41.264
I'm even starting to feel like
asking her to move in with me.

03:45.442 --> 03:48.140
But... No, I don't know

03:48.184 --> 03:49.968
if that's the right thing
right now.

03:51.274 --> 03:53.363
You know, for the moment,

03:53.406 --> 03:55.930
she only sees
what I want her to see.

03:56.975 --> 03:59.151
And I'm worried
that if she moves in,

03:59.195 --> 04:01.850
you know, she'll see it all.

04:03.547 --> 04:06.115
She'll see me
for who I really am, and...

04:06.855 --> 04:09.336
I'm worried
that will scare her off.

04:11.033 --> 04:14.079
[dramatic music builds up]

04:45.894 --> 04:46.982
[man] What's up, man?

04:50.332 --> 04:52.683
[Will sighs] Fuck.

04:54.511 --> 04:56.687
-[Will chuckles softly]
-[man snorts]

04:56.731 --> 04:57.819
[laughing]

05:00.038 --> 05:01.388
Heard you got clean.

05:02.084 --> 05:04.478
[Will] Yeah. Yeah, I did.

05:06.175 --> 05:07.307
Good for you, man.

05:09.526 --> 05:12.355
Um... You're the reason.

05:17.404 --> 05:19.231
Well, to being clean, then, huh?

05:23.627 --> 05:26.151
[crickets chirping]

05:27.109 --> 05:29.329
You think people like us
ever really change?

05:32.636 --> 05:33.985
Um...

05:36.423 --> 05:37.641
I mean, it's...

05:39.295 --> 05:42.516
It's work, you know? But, uh...

05:44.692 --> 05:46.128
Yeah, I do.

05:47.782 --> 05:50.088
And it's been working
for me, so.

05:51.046 --> 05:52.439
I'm not you.

05:54.745 --> 05:58.140
[Will] We're addicts, you know?
We're all the same.

06:01.578 --> 06:03.014
I mean, I have no skills.

06:04.320 --> 06:06.366
And I'm a convicted felon.

06:08.150 --> 06:10.195
And there's no place
in this world for me.

06:11.675 --> 06:12.981
You got your music.

06:16.985 --> 06:19.379
I could have a band. [sniffs]

06:23.078 --> 06:24.427
I mean, unless...

06:27.517 --> 06:29.780
I haven't touched a bass
in years, man.

06:30.825 --> 06:32.043
Do you miss it, though?

06:36.178 --> 06:38.615
I haven't had time
to think about that life.

06:42.271 --> 06:44.447
Yeah, time's all I got. [laughs]

06:46.101 --> 06:47.537
Well...

06:49.147 --> 06:50.584
One day at a time, you know?

06:52.977 --> 06:54.370
One day at a time.

06:57.286 --> 06:58.808
Fuck, man.
If I wanted platitudes,

06:58.853 --> 07:00.420
I'd just go to a meeting.

07:05.250 --> 07:06.469
[Will] What do you want?

07:15.609 --> 07:17.393
I don't know if I can do this.

07:19.917 --> 07:20.788
Do what?

07:25.227 --> 07:26.707
Just this, man. This...

07:29.144 --> 07:30.362
This fucking life.

07:36.630 --> 07:38.022
What life do you want?

07:41.373 --> 07:42.984
Just the way things used to be.

07:51.209 --> 07:52.558
I can't help you, man.

07:54.430 --> 07:55.300
[sniffs]

07:59.261 --> 08:00.436
[exhales]

08:01.568 --> 08:03.570
You know, I got my girl
coming now.

08:06.442 --> 08:07.791
So, you don't want me here.

08:24.025 --> 08:25.287
[man] Have a good night.

08:28.290 --> 08:29.465
Who was that?

08:30.335 --> 08:31.641
[Will] Just an old friend.

08:32.642 --> 08:34.861
-Hey.
-What did he want?

08:36.385 --> 08:37.212
Nothing.

Driving around,
looking for work.

09:16.643 --> 09:20.429
[woman] Did you find any?
At this hour?

09:27.001 --> 09:29.351
You took my car
without asking me.

09:30.874 --> 09:32.572
You don't answer your phone.

09:34.486 --> 09:36.097
Yeah, I wanted to be left alone.

09:42.625 --> 09:44.061
Can I see your eyes?

09:51.678 --> 09:52.679
Let me see.

10:01.688 --> 10:02.602
I'm going to bed.

-Goodnight.

I don't understand, but I do.

What'd he do?

Last night in his room.

What it is?

You didn't have to do this.

15:59.436 --> 16:01.351
Come on, do you even own a tie?

16:03.179 --> 16:04.050
No.

Try it on.

about coming with you

16:25.636 --> 16:27.073

16:31.077 --> 16:32.948
I appreciate you wanting to...

come with me.

I do this on my own.

you'd actually make it.

you know?

18:12.395 --> 18:13.527
[whispering] Yeah.

18:15.224 --> 18:16.704
What did he say?

18:17.444 --> 18:19.663
Talked about getting
the band back together.

18:22.188 --> 18:24.146
He kept writing
while he was inside.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.716
It's a fucking shame
we'll never hear it, but...

18:34.200 --> 18:35.592
You still sober?

18:37.681 --> 18:38.943
[Will] I am, yeah.

18:40.293 --> 18:41.424
Yourself?

18:43.644 --> 18:45.341
Um...

18:47.735 --> 18:49.258
Not as strong as you.

You know, neither was he.

18:52.870 --> 18:55.090
[melancholic music]

I'm not better than you,
him, or anyone else.

19:09.235 --> 19:11.019
Well, maybe I'll see you around.

19:13.239 --> 19:14.109
Or not.

19:15.676 --> 19:17.156
Either way, it's all right.

[Claire] Here, sit down.

20:31.578 --> 20:32.405
[Will] Yeah.

20:34.015 --> 20:36.409
I didn't see you at the funeral,
were you there?

-Yeah?

Yeah.

I wish Chris
could've seen you like this.

21:05.960 --> 21:09.006
It just means so much
that you came.

He died.

22:17.118 --> 22:18.380
Jesus, Will.

22:20.513 --> 22:22.036
He just got out of prison.

22:23.254 --> 22:24.560
Came around here
looking for you,

22:24.604 --> 22:26.214
why did he need
to see you so bad?

22:26.823 --> 22:27.694
No reason.

22:28.608 --> 22:30.914
-No reason?
-No.

22:33.003 --> 22:33.874
Come here.

22:35.005 --> 22:36.224
-What?
-Come here.

22:39.836 --> 22:42.230
-Wanna roll up your sleeves?
-[Will sighs]

22:42.273 --> 22:44.841
-I'm clean, Dad.
-Nothing to hide, then, right?

22:56.418 --> 22:57.288
All right?

23:05.296 --> 23:06.472
How's Claire doing?

23:08.256 --> 23:09.083
Well...

23:10.389 --> 23:12.303
like somebody who
just lost their son.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.785
Yeah. Caring for somebody
like that takes its toll.

23:17.570 --> 23:18.875
Sure did on your mom.

23:20.442 --> 23:21.922
But you know that, don't you?

23:25.447 --> 23:26.317
That it, then?

23:31.105 --> 23:32.367
[Will] What do you mean?

23:34.804 --> 23:36.589
You only come here
when you need something,

23:36.632 --> 23:37.981
well, what do you want?

23:39.983 --> 23:41.420
I don't want anything.

23:41.985 --> 23:43.030
Good.

23:49.515 --> 23:51.821
[Becca] And your dad,
what's he like?

23:56.086 --> 23:56.957
I don't know.

23:58.524 --> 23:59.742
Let me guess.

24:00.613 --> 24:02.441
Some mysterious...

24:03.050 --> 24:06.227
brooding, quiet type.

24:07.184 --> 24:10.536
Keeps everything
bottled up inside. [laughs]

24:16.324 --> 24:17.891
When do I get to meet him?

24:20.154 --> 24:22.461
Well, never. Hopefully.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.377
Are you embarrassed of me?

24:27.683 --> 24:31.557
No! No, no, no. It is not you.

24:33.559 --> 24:35.343
It's me
he'd have the problem with.

24:36.562 --> 24:38.477
Maybe just the old you.

24:40.174 --> 24:42.698
No, I saw him when I went back.

24:43.830 --> 24:45.179
He hasn't changed.

24:46.572 --> 24:48.878
It's like he sees me, and...

24:50.358 --> 24:51.881
All he can see is my mom.

24:54.101 --> 24:55.189
And that she's gone.

24:59.454 --> 25:01.108
Well, he just misses her.

25:03.589 --> 25:04.938
It's not that simple.

25:08.028 --> 25:09.290
He blames me.

25:11.814 --> 25:13.207
He blames you?

25:16.123 --> 25:18.125
You know that's not real, right?

25:19.822 --> 25:23.086
It's hard to process grief.

25:24.131 --> 25:26.481
Some people blame themselves,

25:26.525 --> 25:28.875
some people blame other people.

25:28.918 --> 25:30.398
He has his reasons.

25:33.880 --> 25:34.968
You know what?

25:37.187 --> 25:38.798
I don't need to meet him.

25:39.320 --> 25:40.843
Could just be you and me.

25:43.063 --> 25:44.717
Just you and me.

25:46.414 --> 25:47.589
[whispering] Just us.

25:49.809 --> 25:50.679
I like that.

26:19.752 --> 26:20.622
[beep]

26:54.569 --> 26:56.745
[Claire] Hi, Will, it's Claire.

26:56.789 --> 26:59.748
I was calling to tell you
that I've been thinking

26:59.792 --> 27:02.011
about you and Chris, and...

27:02.055 --> 27:06.146
There's something of his
that I know...

27:06.189 --> 27:08.191
I know he'd want you to have.

27:08.844 --> 27:11.194
I was hoping to give it
to you in person.

27:11.804 --> 27:12.805
Um...

27:13.370 --> 27:15.024
Are you free tonight?

27:16.330 --> 27:19.942
[Will] Uh, yeah, yeah. Uh, sure.

27:20.508 --> 27:22.379
Okay, great.
Maybe we can grab a bite.

27:22.423 --> 27:24.294
I'll just call you

27:24.338 --> 27:26.253
and let you know
where we can meet up.

27:28.821 --> 27:32.389
Good, thank you. Uh...
So, I'll see you later, then.

27:34.348 --> 27:35.436
Yeah, all right. Bye.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.663
[Claire] No,
I don't wanna talk about me.

27:45.881 --> 27:47.709
Please don't ask me
how I'm doing.

27:47.753 --> 27:50.016
Don't ask me anything. [laughs]

27:50.059 --> 27:51.800
Just... Let's talk about you.

27:53.497 --> 27:55.108
-Talk about me?
-Yeah.

27:56.413 --> 27:57.632
What do you wanna know?

27:59.068 --> 28:00.374
Do you have a girlfriend?

28:02.376 --> 28:04.073
Yeah, um...

28:06.380 --> 28:07.990
[stammers] Yeah, I do.

28:10.166 --> 28:11.777
And what's she like?

28:11.820 --> 28:14.954
-She's, um, she's sweet.
-Yeah?

28:15.911 --> 28:17.043
She's a good person.

28:18.479 --> 28:20.742
[Will] She's
a nursing assistant, so.

28:22.265 --> 28:23.789
She takes care of you.

28:24.833 --> 28:25.834
Good.

28:27.270 --> 28:29.403
It's not that easy
taking care of someone like me.

28:29.446 --> 28:31.187
No, don't say that.

28:32.275 --> 28:33.712
-It's true.
-No.

28:35.104 --> 28:37.846
Not many people could do
what you did, really.

28:38.804 --> 28:40.022
Chris couldn't.

28:43.069 --> 28:44.940
I wish you two
would've stayed friends.

28:44.984 --> 28:45.854
I really do.

28:48.074 --> 28:49.640
Maybe he would've seen

28:49.684 --> 28:52.121
that there was, you know,
a different path to take.

28:52.426 --> 28:53.296
You know?

28:54.863 --> 28:56.822
I wasn't that person for him.

28:57.823 --> 28:59.563
No, you did what you could.

28:59.607 --> 29:01.130
No, I enabled him.

29:03.829 --> 29:07.223
My threats were
all empty and he knew

29:07.267 --> 29:10.618
no matter what he did
I would take him back.

29:13.055 --> 29:14.274
You were there for him.

29:16.842 --> 29:18.060
Can I ask you something?

29:18.974 --> 29:20.671
[Will] Yeah.

29:20.715 --> 29:22.935
His dad asked me if I thought
it was an accident.

29:25.894 --> 29:27.156
What do you think?

29:29.680 --> 29:30.725
God, I...

29:32.509 --> 29:33.946
[grunts]

29:36.600 --> 29:37.863
I don't know.

29:39.995 --> 29:41.431
You were close to him.

29:44.695 --> 29:46.306
Tell me. Please.

29:48.917 --> 29:50.876
I just can't stop thinking that

29:50.919 --> 29:53.095
he knew exactly
what he was doing.

29:53.139 --> 29:54.009
What do you think?

29:55.445 --> 29:57.926
How could I possibly know
what he was thinking?

29:59.580 --> 30:01.495
[stammers] I think that...

30:02.452 --> 30:03.497
[whispering] I do.

30:07.675 --> 30:08.981
Excuse me.

30:14.769 --> 30:17.816
[melancholic music]

30:19.818 --> 30:21.254
-You okay?
-Yeah.

30:22.255 --> 30:24.213
Do you wanna put on this?

30:24.953 --> 30:28.087
Here, can I...? Here.
Let me put this on.

30:29.044 --> 30:30.306
Let me help you, here.

30:31.612 --> 30:33.832
-There you go.
-Okay, thank you.

30:37.052 --> 30:38.793
-Are you okay?
-[Claire] Yeah.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.100
-[Will] There, there, there.
-Thank you.

30:41.143 --> 30:43.667
-Thank you, thank you.
-That's okay.

30:44.538 --> 30:46.845
[Claire] Oh,
I wanted to give you this.

30:52.154 --> 30:55.157
It was in Chris's room.
I wanted to give it to you.

30:55.810 --> 30:58.682
Yeah. Seven Edge.

30:58.726 --> 30:59.814
Yeah.

31:01.468 --> 31:03.165
I haven't listened to this
in so long.

31:05.428 --> 31:07.300
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

31:08.736 --> 31:09.737
Okay, goodnight.

31:12.914 --> 31:15.743
Uh, Claire? Hey, wait up!

31:16.439 --> 31:18.441
[Will] Hey. [laughs]

31:18.485 --> 31:20.182
You're not trying to drive home.

31:20.226 --> 31:21.183
[Claire] I'm okay.

31:21.836 --> 31:23.882
I don't think
that's a good idea.

31:25.448 --> 31:27.798
-Claire...
-I'm fine, I promise.

31:28.930 --> 31:30.018
Can I drive you home?

31:34.327 --> 31:35.197
Yeah?

31:37.156 --> 31:38.026
Come on.

31:40.986 --> 31:42.030
Come on.

31:42.552 --> 31:45.729
[soft guitar music]

32:25.117 --> 32:27.946
[Claire] Can you get me
a glass of water, please, Will?

32:27.989 --> 32:29.295
[Will] Yeah. Yeah, sure.

32:34.387 --> 32:35.823
[water pours]

33:03.068 --> 33:04.330
[Will whispering] Claire.

33:11.206 --> 33:12.077
Claire.

33:19.432 --> 33:20.911
Come here, come here.

33:32.358 --> 33:33.620
You want some?

33:34.490 --> 33:36.144
[Will] I'm good, I'm good.

33:36.188 --> 33:37.667
[Claire whispering] Thank you.

33:37.711 --> 33:38.581
[kiss]

33:39.887 --> 33:42.498
[Will] All right, um,
I should probably go.

33:42.542 --> 33:44.065
[Claire] Will you stay for me?

33:46.111 --> 33:48.330
[whispers] At least
just until I fall asleep.

33:48.939 --> 33:50.463
Please.

33:50.506 --> 33:52.813
-[Will] Yeah, yeah. Yeah, sure.
-Thank you.

33:59.559 --> 34:01.039
[Claire groans softly]

35:16.418 --> 35:18.681
[both moan]

35:26.820 --> 35:28.169
[Will] Oh, Claire.

35:41.182 --> 35:42.227
I should go.

35:50.235 --> 35:51.366
I should go.

35:58.025 --> 35:59.374
[Claire whispers] Okay.

36:02.943 --> 36:05.163
-[Will] Goodnight.
-[Claire] Goodnight.

36:28.534 --> 36:29.404
[door closes]

36:29.448 --> 36:32.364
[dramatic music]

36:33.495 --> 36:34.757
[lighter clicks]

36:51.252 --> 36:52.601
[engine starts]

36:58.085 --> 37:01.131
[dramatic music]

37:31.640 --> 37:32.511
[woman] Hey!

37:34.164 --> 37:35.209
[Claire] Hi.

37:36.558 --> 37:38.125
[Linda] I didn't know
you were coming in today.

37:38.168 --> 37:39.213
[Claire] Yeah.

37:43.261 --> 37:44.436
[Linda] How are you?

37:45.698 --> 37:46.742
[Claire sighs]

37:49.267 --> 37:50.485
You know.

37:53.488 --> 37:56.317
[Linda] You know, if you ever
want someone to talk to...

37:56.361 --> 37:59.102
I'll call you. I promise.

37:59.755 --> 38:00.800
I was...

38:02.367 --> 38:04.369
thinking maybe somebody who'd...

38:05.108 --> 38:07.197
be better at knowing
what to say.

38:09.374 --> 38:14.683
And I know a therapist.
My therapist.

38:16.032 --> 38:18.600
And I just think
she'd be really good for you.

38:20.602 --> 38:22.604
You think I've never
talked to a shrink?

38:28.436 --> 38:30.438
You don't have
to go through this alone.

38:37.793 --> 38:39.578
Do you want me to keep
the boxwoods like this

38:39.621 --> 38:40.883
or should I switch them?

38:41.362 --> 38:42.842
Oh, yeah, that's fine.

38:42.885 --> 38:44.278
-Okay.
-Yeah.

38:45.888 --> 38:48.935
[dramatic music]

38:53.896 --> 38:54.941
Hey.

39:09.390 --> 39:12.393
[tense music]

39:15.570 --> 39:17.180
Where are you going?

39:19.313 --> 39:20.793
[Will] To a meeting.

39:20.836 --> 39:23.883
[tense music]

39:25.101 --> 39:27.626
[Becca] You're really going
to a meeting right now?

39:27.669 --> 39:29.062
[Will] Yes!

39:29.105 --> 39:30.280
[Becca] So you can go
talk to strangers

39:30.324 --> 39:31.847
but you can't talk to me?

39:32.370 --> 39:33.980
[Will] You wouldn't understand.

39:37.113 --> 39:40.029
[dramatic music]

39:44.947 --> 39:46.296
[knocks on door]

39:53.303 --> 39:54.914
-[Claire] Hi!
-[Will] Hey.

39:56.219 --> 39:57.264
[Claire] Come in.

39:57.743 --> 40:00.789
[dramatic music]

40:12.497 --> 40:13.628
You all right?

40:14.890 --> 40:16.152
[Will sighs]

40:17.980 --> 40:19.504
Yeah, yeah.

40:23.812 --> 40:24.987
[Claire] What's wrong?

40:29.862 --> 40:30.950
[Will] I don't know.

40:36.564 --> 40:38.174
I didn't wanna be alone.

40:41.830 --> 40:43.702
But I couldn't be
around other people.

40:51.884 --> 40:53.494
Why did you come here?

40:58.586 --> 41:01.633
[melancholic music]

41:24.482 --> 41:25.700
[Claire moans]

41:41.803 --> 41:44.023
[Claire] It was always
just me and Chris, you know?

41:44.066 --> 41:46.112
It was the two of us, and now...

41:47.766 --> 41:53.380
I just, I spent so much time
just wanting my own life and...

41:56.426 --> 41:58.037
[breaking] I don't know.

42:00.474 --> 42:01.910
I wanna go back.

42:04.434 --> 42:06.524
I wanna go back
and tell him I'm sorry.

42:15.924 --> 42:18.623
How did you do it?
How did you and your dad do it?

42:19.493 --> 42:21.539
When your mom was dying.

42:23.236 --> 42:25.368
She was the one that was sick.

42:26.544 --> 42:28.502
I wasn't going through chemo.

42:29.895 --> 42:32.767
I wasn't losing weight
cause I can't keep food down.

42:34.769 --> 42:36.205
In the end...

42:37.685 --> 42:39.600
she was so frail,

42:39.644 --> 42:41.602
I helped her go
to the fucking bathroom.

42:43.430 --> 42:44.692
You took care of her.

42:46.999 --> 42:48.391
I mean...

42:49.218 --> 42:50.916
most days, I...

42:51.569 --> 42:53.266
come home from school

42:54.397 --> 42:57.879
and I would just sit with her,
while she was asleep.

42:58.401 --> 43:00.839
They had her on meds
to manage the pain.

43:04.843 --> 43:08.586
So I sit, and I wait for her
to fall asleep.

43:10.675 --> 43:12.198
So I could take some.

43:14.548 --> 43:16.202
There was this one time,

43:17.116 --> 43:19.248
I'm sure she's sleeping,

43:20.946 --> 43:22.556
so I take some.

43:25.603 --> 43:27.517
When I look back at her,

43:28.562 --> 43:30.390
she's staring right at me.

43:31.913 --> 43:33.219
[Claire] God.

43:35.308 --> 43:38.267
Did you tell her
that you were sorry?

43:41.270 --> 43:42.141
No.

43:47.059 --> 43:48.887
I wasn't there when she died.

43:55.676 --> 43:57.286
Oh, my God.

44:02.422 --> 44:05.294
[Claire] We've both been
through the same thing.

44:05.991 --> 44:08.907
Caring for somebody
who's so sick.

44:10.735 --> 44:12.562
There's nothing you can do
about it.

44:12.606 --> 44:14.826
Except watch them waste away,
you know.

44:16.828 --> 44:18.786
You did everything you could.

44:27.490 --> 44:29.101
When he came home that night,

44:31.277 --> 44:33.018
I knew something was wrong.

44:33.061 --> 44:34.062
He just...

44:35.368 --> 44:37.718
walked into his room
and I didn't stop him.

44:37.762 --> 44:40.808
And I just feel like I fucking
let him kill himself.

44:40.852 --> 44:41.896
Hey, hey.

44:41.940 --> 44:43.202
I do.

44:43.245 --> 44:44.769
-That's not true.
-No.

44:45.073 --> 44:46.771
I feel a sense of relief.

44:47.510 --> 44:48.555
I do.

44:52.298 --> 44:53.342
It's okay.

44:57.477 --> 44:59.000
It wasn't your fault.

45:02.177 --> 45:03.483
You weren't there.

45:08.793 --> 45:10.142
But you're here now.

45:11.883 --> 45:12.927
You're here now.

45:47.527 --> 45:48.789
Good morning.

45:48.833 --> 45:50.008
-Hey, good morning.
-Here you go.

45:50.051 --> 45:51.400
-Thanks.
-[kiss]

45:51.444 --> 45:52.532
You're welcome.

45:53.228 --> 45:54.360
Sit down.

45:55.230 --> 45:57.450
Do you want cream or sugar,
or anything?

45:57.493 --> 46:00.148
-No, I'm good. Black.
-Okay.

46:07.373 --> 46:10.071
You didn't really have to
go through all this trouble.

46:10.115 --> 46:11.725
It wasn't any trouble.

46:19.864 --> 46:21.256
-[Claire laughs]
-What?

46:22.605 --> 46:23.563
Nothing.

46:31.049 --> 46:32.528

46:39.840 --> 46:40.928
Yeah.

[dramatic music]

[dramatic music fades out]

47:48.474 --> 47:49.518
Hey.

47:50.955 --> 47:52.086
How was your meeting?

47:54.959 --> 47:55.873
It was good.

47:56.569 --> 47:58.223
Did you get out of your chest

47:58.266 --> 48:00.399
whatever it was that had you
so fucked up, last night?

48:01.269 --> 48:02.836
I can't talk about it.

48:06.187 --> 48:07.928
I talked about
how much I need you.

48:09.451 --> 48:11.279
And that you are
the only thing in my life

48:11.323 --> 48:12.498
that keeps me from using.

48:15.718 --> 48:16.676
Is that true?

48:17.764 --> 48:19.548
It's not fair for me
to say that.

48:20.985 --> 48:22.029
It's not fair on you.

48:23.335 --> 48:24.858
It's not your
responsibility to...

48:24.902 --> 48:25.903
Hey!

48:28.253 --> 48:29.907
I'm glad you told me.

48:31.734 --> 48:32.910
And I'm sorry.

48:34.085 --> 48:35.477
What are you sorry for?

48:36.565 --> 48:38.263
Those meetings
are your sanctuary.

48:39.394 --> 48:41.527
I shouldn't make you
feel guilty for that.

48:43.050 --> 48:43.921
Okay?

48:52.625 --> 48:54.018
[Claire] What are you
looking to do?

48:54.061 --> 48:55.889
[Phil] I've been thinking
about doing

48:55.933 --> 48:57.412
a little gardening at the front.

48:57.456 --> 48:59.893
-Oh.
-Figured you're the one to talk.

48:59.937 --> 49:00.807
Yeah.

49:01.416 --> 49:03.201
Well, this are seasonal, so...

49:04.854 --> 49:06.160
Okay.

49:06.204 --> 49:07.553
You looking for anything
in particular?

49:08.641 --> 49:09.642
What do you like?

49:11.383 --> 49:13.776
Well, everybody is different,
but myself,

49:13.820 --> 49:16.518
I gravitate, actually,
towards lilies.

49:16.562 --> 49:17.998
-These lilies?
-Yeah.

49:18.042 --> 49:20.218
I like plants of that nature.

49:20.958 --> 49:22.002
Okay.

49:22.046 --> 49:23.395
But, why don't you look around

49:23.438 --> 49:24.918
and, if you see
anything you like,

49:24.962 --> 49:26.180
you know, just let me know.

49:26.224 --> 49:27.442
Yeah, okay.

49:28.661 --> 49:32.665
I didn't just come in
to look at the plants.

49:32.708 --> 49:34.754
I came in to see you, you know?

49:35.059 --> 49:36.495
See how you're doing.

49:39.063 --> 49:40.151
I'm getting by.

49:40.194 --> 49:41.543
But thanks.

49:43.197 --> 49:45.156
I haven't gone through what
you're going through, I just...

49:45.721 --> 49:48.463
If you ever need
somebody to talk to

49:48.507 --> 49:50.988
or just somebody to listen,
you know...

49:51.031 --> 49:53.642
Phil, I'm just not a good
company, right now.

49:56.123 --> 49:57.168
Yeah.

49:58.734 --> 50:00.214
You know what? I...

50:01.955 --> 50:03.652
I think you're right,
the lilies.

50:05.045 --> 50:07.221
I'll take, what, six?

50:07.265 --> 50:10.094
Make it eight.
I'll meet you at the register.

50:10.137 --> 50:11.878
-Thank you.
-All right, thanks.

[Claire] Hi, Will, it's Claire.

50:22.323 --> 50:24.021
I wonder where you are.

50:25.239 --> 50:26.588
I've...

50:26.632 --> 50:28.547
Maybe, you just feel
like being alone.

50:30.505 --> 50:31.898
But, I'm here.

50:32.420 --> 50:35.554
And I just don't want to have
to worry about you.

50:38.165 --> 50:40.298
So, just let me know
you're okay.

50:40.341 --> 50:42.691
And, I'd really love
to hear your voice.

50:46.521 --> 50:47.653
And that's all.

50:47.696 --> 50:48.741
Okay, bye.

51:03.060 --> 51:04.844
is this?

51:07.151 --> 51:08.935
It's just the band
I used to play in.

51:09.588 --> 51:11.503
How come you never
told me about this?

51:12.982 --> 51:13.896
I don't know.

51:18.771 --> 51:19.772
What are you doing?

51:21.208 --> 51:22.688
Hey.

51:22.731 --> 51:24.081
-Actually, Becca...

Hey, Becca, I'm serious,
I don't want to hear it.

51:41.185 --> 51:43.056
All right, would you
turn it off, now?

-I like it.
-Becca, I'm serious!

52:03.424 --> 52:04.730
Fuck.

52:11.693 --> 52:13.304
I know what you're doing.

52:15.480 --> 52:16.785
What am I doing?

52:18.309 --> 52:20.528
You're blaming yourself
for what happened with Chris.

52:23.183 --> 52:24.837
You don't know
what you're talking about.

52:27.970 --> 52:29.015
So, tell me.

52:38.981 --> 52:40.461
Or I could just go.

53:24.462 --> 53:26.507
[Will] I lost my friend,
recently.

53:27.073 --> 53:28.509
He wasn't just my friend.

53:29.945 --> 53:31.295
He was my best friend.

53:32.339 --> 53:34.820
And we used to play
in this band together.

53:37.344 --> 53:38.476
He was really...

53:39.216 --> 53:40.826
He was really special.

53:42.044 --> 53:43.089
And, um...

53:46.223 --> 53:47.833
He could've had a life.

53:50.357 --> 53:51.924
But he started using.

53:56.058 --> 53:57.103
Like me.

54:03.718 --> 54:04.763
Because of me.

54:15.339 --> 54:16.340
It was hard.

54:18.342 --> 54:19.821
[mumbling]

54:19.865 --> 54:21.214
His last night he...

54:23.825 --> 54:25.174
He came to see me.

54:25.218 --> 54:26.698
You know, he came by.

54:28.830 --> 54:32.747
I... I just couldn't stand
the sight of him.

54:35.402 --> 54:36.795
What I'd done to him.

54:41.756 --> 54:43.062
I couldn't look at him.

54:49.286 --> 54:50.983
So, I turned my back on him.

54:57.598 --> 54:58.817
And now, he's gone.

55:26.540 --> 55:27.585
Hi.

55:32.198 --> 55:33.242
What's wrong?

Come inside. Come on.

that I'm... I'm sorry.

56:09.104 --> 56:10.758
What are you sorry for?

56:23.641 --> 56:24.946
For Chris.

56:25.904 --> 56:26.948
I know that.

56:28.167 --> 56:29.211
I know.

56:33.738 --> 56:34.869
Do you think

56:36.349 --> 56:38.395
I don't wish I could go back
in time and do something?

56:48.796 --> 56:50.145
We can't.

to feel sorry about.

Do I know you?

58:09.355 --> 58:11.096

58:11.400 --> 58:13.751
I went to school
with Chris, though.

58:13.794 --> 58:15.100
He was a year ahead of me.

58:19.844 --> 58:22.890
I only came over here
because I saw you looking at me.

58:25.371 --> 58:27.068
Thought maybe you
were talking about me?

58:27.112 --> 58:28.505
Were you talking about me?

58:29.810 --> 58:31.986
I just told my friend
what happened.

58:34.859 --> 58:37.165
And, when you were telling her
what happened,

58:37.209 --> 58:38.515
what did you say?

58:39.951 --> 58:42.431
Did you tell her
that he killed himself?

58:42.475 --> 58:43.520
No.

58:44.259 --> 58:46.218
She just mentioned
that you had...

58:48.263 --> 58:49.308
lost your son.

58:51.484 --> 58:52.529
Yeah.

58:54.879 --> 58:55.923
Yeah.

59:01.276 --> 59:03.104
He was gentle.

59:06.586 --> 59:07.892
He was a good person.

59:09.110 --> 59:10.155
And it hurt.

59:11.156 --> 59:13.854
I hope that's
how you remember him.

59:13.898 --> 59:15.639

I can see you're not fine.

59:57.332 --> 59:58.812
No, really, I'm fine.

1:00:02.424 --> 1:00:05.384
Listen, I have
an appointment, later.

1:00:07.560 --> 1:00:08.866

1:00:09.518 --> 1:00:12.652
With your permission,
I would like to call her

1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:15.481
and just see if you can go
in my place.

what that's like.

If you won't go for yourself,
then go for me.

1:00:50.081 --> 1:00:51.125
Please?

1:00:52.561 --> 1:00:54.041
As my friend, just...

1:00:55.086 --> 1:00:56.130
go.

Yeah.

What's your relationship
with him like?

What did Linda tell you
about me?

1:01:25.072 --> 1:01:29.076
She told me she had a friend
who needed someone to talk to.

1:01:32.601 --> 1:01:33.777
Tell me about your son.

1:01:35.692 --> 1:01:37.868
Yeah. He, he, he...

He's 25, will be 26 in August.

I do, I do.

She takes good care of him.

1:02:01.108 --> 1:02:04.198

you took care of him.

1:02:06.070 --> 1:02:07.549

the two of us, so...

1:05:06.554 --> 1:05:08.078
[dramatic music fades out]

1:05:08.730 --> 1:05:11.298
-Hey, Phil.
-Hey. How are you?

1:05:19.089 --> 1:05:20.960
-Hey.
-Hey.

1:05:22.919 --> 1:05:23.876
Come in.

1:05:32.102 --> 1:05:32.972
Thank you.

1:05:34.452 --> 1:05:36.236
[Claire] I've been so busy

1:05:37.759 --> 1:05:40.806
with the funeral and

1:05:41.720 --> 1:05:43.417
all those details
you don't know.

1:05:43.461 --> 1:05:45.158
-I didn't know...
-Yeah.

1:05:45.202 --> 1:05:47.900
What song he wanted me to play,
you know.

1:05:48.422 --> 1:05:50.120
-It's hard.
-Right?

1:05:51.077 --> 1:05:51.991
And then...

1:05:53.340 --> 1:05:55.516
I haven't really had any time
to feel anything.

1:05:55.560 --> 1:05:59.607
And, now, I'm trying to get
my life back together and...

1:05:59.912 --> 1:06:02.654
I just realize more and more.

1:06:06.963 --> 1:06:09.356
I'm alone and I'm a loner.

1:06:11.489 --> 1:06:14.883
Well, you and Doug have been
divorced for a long time.

1:06:14.927 --> 1:06:16.711
How come you never remarried?

1:06:19.671 --> 1:06:21.107
I've had boyfriends.

1:06:22.456 --> 1:06:25.546
Some good ones.
It's just, they can't handle it.

1:06:25.590 --> 1:06:28.419
-They couldn't handle Chris.
-Yeah.

1:06:29.811 --> 1:06:32.597
What about you? How come
you never got married again?

1:06:34.773 --> 1:06:35.817
Nah.

1:06:37.036 --> 1:06:39.821
Not looking to replace Diane.

1:06:40.822 --> 1:06:43.608
No, no, you can't replace
someone you loved.

1:06:44.739 --> 1:06:46.045
What's the point?

1:06:48.917 --> 1:06:50.049
To not be alone.

1:06:52.182 --> 1:06:53.531
I don't know. I...

1:06:55.185 --> 1:06:57.056
still sleep on my side
of the bed,

1:06:57.100 --> 1:06:58.318
as if she's still there.

1:07:00.581 --> 1:07:03.541
Phil, oh my God. [kiss]

1:07:09.329 --> 1:07:10.809
I just want us to be okay.

1:07:11.810 --> 1:07:15.596
Will, I want us to be okay, too.

1:07:17.207 --> 1:07:18.773
But... [sighs]

1:07:19.687 --> 1:07:23.778
I can't do this if you're
not going to let me in.

1:07:25.389 --> 1:07:27.086
I'm scared.

1:07:31.134 --> 1:07:33.614
I'm scared that
if you knew the real me...

1:07:36.095 --> 1:07:37.314
That you'd leave.

1:07:39.968 --> 1:07:41.709
And you wouldn't come back.

1:07:45.365 --> 1:07:47.150
I've been pushing you away.

1:07:50.936 --> 1:07:53.765
I thought I could be alone.

1:07:56.594 --> 1:07:57.638
But I'm wrong.

1:07:59.988 --> 1:08:01.033
I need you.

1:08:05.211 --> 1:08:06.560
Please, stay with me.

1:08:17.832 --> 1:08:19.050
[whispering] Come here.

1:08:21.923 --> 1:08:23.099
[sobbing]

1:08:24.012 --> 1:08:25.710
[dramatic music fades in]

1:08:31.411 --> 1:08:32.804
[laughter]

1:08:34.022 --> 1:08:35.067
[laughter]

1:08:44.903 --> 1:08:46.905
-[whispering] I'm sorry.
-[Claire] What?

1:08:48.124 --> 1:08:49.125
What?

1:08:53.520 --> 1:08:54.826
I don't think I can.

1:08:56.654 --> 1:08:58.176
[whispering] I'm sorry.

1:09:03.791 --> 1:09:05.967
Are you feeling guilty or...?

1:09:06.011 --> 1:09:07.360
No, I don't feel guilt.

1:09:08.318 --> 1:09:10.407
-[Claire] Well, you shouldn't.
-I don't.

1:09:11.582 --> 1:09:13.323
I'm not to blame, so...

1:09:14.628 --> 1:09:16.021
To blame for what?

1:09:16.064 --> 1:09:18.241
All this... shit.

1:09:20.939 --> 1:09:21.983
What shit?

1:09:22.853 --> 1:09:24.290
You know,
what happened to your boy,

1:09:24.334 --> 1:09:27.598
and what happened to... Diane.

1:09:29.948 --> 1:09:32.210
I really... I don't know
what you're talking about.

1:09:32.646 --> 1:09:34.908
Diane didn't just die
from that cancer.

1:09:36.649 --> 1:09:38.565
Seeing what Will had become...

1:09:40.437 --> 1:09:42.395
The toll that that put on her...

1:09:42.787 --> 1:09:45.137
What you're going through,
right now.

1:09:45.181 --> 1:09:46.356
[Claire] No.

1:09:46.791 --> 1:09:48.749
They're addicts, they're sick.

1:09:49.620 --> 1:09:50.664
Claire, that's...

1:09:51.665 --> 1:09:53.058
just an excuse.

1:09:53.101 --> 1:09:55.147
It's just... bullshit.

1:09:56.844 --> 1:09:59.891
You have your son.
He's turned his life around.

1:10:00.587 --> 1:10:02.327
After wrecking his family.

1:10:04.330 --> 1:10:05.418
And yours.

1:10:06.680 --> 1:10:09.509
-I mean...
-How did he wreck my family?

1:10:09.553 --> 1:10:12.032
Well, imagine Will
never gets hooked.

1:10:12.077 --> 1:10:13.861
He never gets Chris hooked.

1:10:13.905 --> 1:10:15.254
Everybody's alive.

1:10:16.168 --> 1:10:17.865
Living like normal people.

1:10:20.216 --> 1:10:21.217
We'll never know.

1:10:22.392 --> 1:10:24.263
No, we'll never know.

1:10:25.525 --> 1:10:26.744
Well...

1:10:27.309 --> 1:10:29.529
If Chris hadn't come
to see Will that night,

1:10:31.183 --> 1:10:32.532
things would be different.

1:10:34.273 --> 1:10:35.143
What night?

1:10:36.841 --> 1:10:37.929
His last night.

1:10:39.974 --> 1:10:42.237
He told me he was
looking for a job.

1:10:43.978 --> 1:10:45.850
Yeah, more like out
looking for dope.

1:10:52.291 --> 1:10:54.119
-Hey.
-Could you leave, please?

1:10:56.817 --> 1:10:59.472
-Claire, I wasn't trying to...
-No, please, leave.

1:10:59.516 --> 1:11:01.300
-Please.
-What did I say?

1:11:01.344 --> 1:11:03.171
Please, leave. Please.

1:11:04.608 --> 1:11:07.741
-[whispering] Please.
-Okay. I'm sorry.

1:11:11.049 --> 1:11:12.093
[door opens]

1:11:13.050 --> 1:11:14.094
[door closes]

1:11:17.098 --> 1:11:18.925
[dramatic music fades in]

1:11:36.248 --> 1:11:37.989
[dramatic music fades out]

1:11:49.348 --> 1:11:50.393
Ew.

1:11:54.222 --> 1:11:55.267
Morning.

1:11:56.486 --> 1:11:57.617
[groaning]

1:11:58.575 --> 1:11:59.619
[Will] No.

1:12:01.404 --> 1:12:02.883
Why did you do that?

1:12:03.666 --> 1:12:05.407
[Becca] Because it's disgusting.

1:12:05.451 --> 1:12:07.800
Well, if we're ever going
to live together...

1:12:07.844 --> 1:12:08.889
[Becca] What?

1:12:10.456 --> 1:12:15.809
I mean, I'm just saying that
if we were to live together,

1:12:15.853 --> 1:12:18.334
that is something
you'd have to get used to.

1:12:21.772 --> 1:12:26.124
Is this your way
of asking me to live with you?

1:12:26.166 --> 1:12:27.038
No.

1:12:27.647 --> 1:12:28.518
No?

1:12:30.041 --> 1:12:30.911
I mean,

1:12:32.130 --> 1:12:33.523
I thought about it.

1:12:34.175 --> 1:12:36.830
Because,
if we're going to live together,

1:12:36.874 --> 1:12:39.833
you're going to need to make
some changes around here.

1:12:39.877 --> 1:12:42.619
So, is that a no, then?

1:12:44.316 --> 1:12:47.318
It's not... not a no.

1:12:47.362 --> 1:12:49.103
Hey, where are you going?

1:12:49.147 --> 1:12:51.279
-[laughing]
-Come here.

1:12:52.977 --> 1:12:54.282
-Hey.
-Hey.

1:12:56.937 --> 1:12:59.244
[knocking on door]

1:13:07.295 --> 1:13:09.428
-Can you wait here?
-Yeah.

1:13:20.657 --> 1:13:21.875
What are you doing here?

1:13:22.702 --> 1:13:25.096
Um, I wanted to talk to you.

1:13:27.490 --> 1:13:28.882
I'm letting myself in.

1:13:30.666 --> 1:13:31.710
Thanks.

1:13:33.321 --> 1:13:34.366
Wow.

1:13:37.500 --> 1:13:38.544
Nice.

1:13:41.416 --> 1:13:42.418
I'm Claire.

1:13:43.070 --> 1:13:43.941
Hi.

1:13:45.377 --> 1:13:46.334
I'm Becca.

1:13:47.423 --> 1:13:49.207
Oh, I've heard a lot about you.

1:13:51.252 --> 1:13:52.906
[Claire] Did you ever had
one of those days

1:13:52.950 --> 1:13:54.691
where you feel like
you can't be alone?

1:13:55.561 --> 1:13:58.434
How about you? Did you ever had
one of those days?

1:14:00.174 --> 1:14:01.045
Yeah, sure.

1:14:01.523 --> 1:14:02.829
[grunts softly]

1:14:02.873 --> 1:14:04.222
Have you been up
drinking all night?

1:14:05.876 --> 1:14:06.920
No.

1:14:09.139 --> 1:14:10.489
Would you like some water?

1:14:10.532 --> 1:14:12.925
-Go get her some water.
-No, no, just...

1:14:12.969 --> 1:14:14.101
Sit down, please.

1:14:14.841 --> 1:14:16.364
-Okay.
-[Claire] Thank you.

1:14:26.809 --> 1:14:29.856
God, you must be thinking,
who the fuck is this woman?

1:14:31.989 --> 1:14:33.730
I sound like his mother, huh?

1:14:34.905 --> 1:14:36.472
I'm not his mother.

1:14:36.514 --> 1:14:38.865
But sometimes,
I feel like his mother.

1:14:41.302 --> 1:14:43.043
He got kicked out
of his house all the time,

1:14:43.087 --> 1:14:44.436
or he was just hungry, or...

1:14:45.523 --> 1:14:46.394
Anything.

1:14:47.395 --> 1:14:48.484
I'd always let him in.

1:14:51.008 --> 1:14:52.879
Even now, when he shows up

1:14:52.923 --> 1:14:55.621
in the middle of the night,
I still don't turn him away.

1:14:58.014 --> 1:14:58.885
Right?

1:15:02.846 --> 1:15:04.412
He's like my second son.

1:15:05.936 --> 1:15:07.546
Like a second son.

1:15:11.985 --> 1:15:14.597
But you're not my son. Mm-mm.

1:15:15.554 --> 1:15:18.644
My real son was Chris. He died.

1:15:20.166 --> 1:15:21.473
Yeah, he just died.

1:15:23.431 --> 1:15:24.998
[whispering] I'm so sorry.

1:15:26.652 --> 1:15:27.914
[Claire] God, life...

1:15:28.611 --> 1:15:31.744
[laughing] It really fucks
with you, right?

1:15:32.353 --> 1:15:33.398
God.

1:15:35.705 --> 1:15:38.969
It's just, all these paths
that you can take and...

1:15:40.448 --> 1:15:41.841
I mean, look at Will.

1:15:43.407 --> 1:15:44.452
Look at you.

1:15:45.410 --> 1:15:47.281
You got your whole life
together.

1:15:48.195 --> 1:15:51.023
Beautiful house and a good job.

1:15:53.070 --> 1:15:54.245
Pretty girl.

1:15:54.898 --> 1:15:56.813
When you think of Chris...

1:15:56.856 --> 1:15:59.555
And he could've been the one

1:16:00.164 --> 1:16:02.862
with the house and the girl,
and the job,

1:16:02.906 --> 1:16:05.082
if he'd never met Will.

1:16:05.125 --> 1:16:05.996
Right?

1:16:06.474 --> 1:16:07.563
Yeah.

1:16:09.129 --> 1:16:11.001
-[whispering] You should leave.
-[Claire] I should leave?

1:16:11.044 --> 1:16:13.960
Isn't denial one of the first
steps you people go through?

1:16:14.004 --> 1:16:16.093
I'm in denial? I'm in denial?

1:16:17.181 --> 1:16:19.575
Chris dies in your home
and you're there,

1:16:19.618 --> 1:16:20.880
and I'm in denial!

1:16:23.013 --> 1:16:24.666
Take a fucking look at yourself.

1:16:42.989 --> 1:16:44.034
You...

1:16:45.775 --> 1:16:46.645
and...

1:16:47.514 --> 1:16:48.559
that woman...

1:16:48.603 --> 1:16:49.866
[dramatic music fades in]

1:16:50.693 --> 1:16:51.607
[scoffs]

1:17:00.005 --> 1:17:01.834
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1:17:17.023 --> 1:17:17.981
Hey, hey.

1:17:18.023 --> 1:17:19.809
Please, please, please.

1:17:19.852 --> 1:17:20.897
Don't go.

1:17:22.159 --> 1:17:23.813
Why should I stay here?

1:17:27.468 --> 1:17:28.513
I need you.

1:17:31.342 --> 1:17:32.212
[grunt]

1:18:04.941 --> 1:18:05.811
Claire!

1:18:06.856 --> 1:18:08.118
[Claire] Why are you here?

1:18:08.161 --> 1:18:09.206
Just let me in.

1:18:11.556 --> 1:18:12.600
Please.

1:18:17.344 --> 1:18:18.389
[door closing]

1:18:20.478 --> 1:18:22.393
I just wanted a normal life.

1:18:24.787 --> 1:18:26.397
Away from all of this.

1:18:29.922 --> 1:18:32.184
You don't think
I feel the pain you feel?

1:18:45.111 --> 1:18:46.504
[dramatic music fades out]

1:18:50.116 --> 1:18:52.031
[Claire] This is
were I found him.

1:18:53.728 --> 1:18:56.340
His eyes were open,
he was still.

1:19:02.868 --> 1:19:04.957
Because he was gone,
already. [sniffs]

1:19:11.398 --> 1:19:12.965
He died alone, that night.

1:19:17.665 --> 1:19:19.189
Why did he go to see you?

1:19:24.107 --> 1:19:26.544
He wanted something
I couldn't give him.

1:19:28.807 --> 1:19:29.808
[Claire] What?

1:19:32.942 --> 1:19:34.726
For us to be his friend, again.

1:19:39.731 --> 1:19:41.472
I just wanted him to leave.

1:19:43.561 --> 1:19:44.692
I'm sorry.

1:19:45.824 --> 1:19:48.348
Is that why you came here?
To apologize?

1:19:57.662 --> 1:19:59.795
[sobbing] You got to
say goodbye. I didn't.

1:20:00.143 --> 1:20:01.187
I didn't.

1:20:07.019 --> 1:20:08.107
And I'm...

1:20:09.413 --> 1:20:11.937
I'm here. I can't go anywhere.
I'm just here.

1:20:12.371 --> 1:20:13.809
I'll always be here.
