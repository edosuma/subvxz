00:01.101 --> 00:02.935
<i>Previously on "Alias. "</i>

00:02.936 --> 00:05.371
Trusting anyone will take time.

00:05.372 --> 00:07.872
You know so much about me.

00:08.375 --> 00:10.576
I know almost nothing about you.

00:10.577 --> 00:13.568
I want to... very much.

00:13.646 --> 00:16.513
A Covenant official
wants to defect.

00:16.583 --> 00:17.816
Leonid Lisenker.

00:17.817 --> 00:19.585
In exchange
for his extraction and immunity,

00:19.586 --> 00:21.286
he's willing to turn over
everything he knows

00:21.287 --> 00:22.254
about The Covenant.

00:22.255 --> 00:23.789
Believe it or not,
these schematics

00:23.790 --> 00:26.290
are two times scale,
meaning this plasma charge

00:26.326 --> 00:27.726
is only 6 inches in diameter.

00:27.727 --> 00:30.227
But it packs a wallop.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.371
Freeze!

00:41.107 --> 00:43.607
Give me the bomb.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074

01:18.578 --> 01:20.913
Out of the way! Hurry up!
Move it now!

01:20.914 --> 01:23.414
Come on! Follow me!

01:35.662 --> 01:38.162
This is way out of my league.

01:41.468 --> 01:43.569
Motion sensor.

01:43.570 --> 01:47.301
A dedicated board running
God knows how many programs.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.668
There's no way
we'd shut this down in time.

01:50.743 --> 01:54.270
Our best bet is to try
and defuse the motion sensor

01:54.347 --> 01:56.548
and get this off site
in a blast containment vessel

01:56.549 --> 01:57.916
before it vaporizes the block.

01:57.917 --> 02:00.417
Can you do that?

02:04.691 --> 02:07.455
I've found the lead
for the motion sensor.

02:07.527 --> 02:10.026
I'm cutting it.

02:11.464 --> 02:12.698
It's no good.

02:12.699 --> 02:16.294
It's still operational.
It must be looped.

02:16.369 --> 02:18.770
What the hell do we do now?

02:18.771 --> 02:21.271
Your guess is as good as mine.

02:22.275 --> 02:24.775
My kid's favorite color is red.

02:40.760 --> 02:42.661
The Wicklow National Bank
Building,

02:42.662 --> 02:44.029
or what's left of it.

02:44.030 --> 02:45.764
Do we know who's responsible?

02:45.765 --> 02:47.766
His name is Daniel Ryan.

02:47.767 --> 02:49.535
This morning
we intercepted a message

02:49.536 --> 02:51.770
he sent to The Covenant
taking credit for the bombing.

02:51.771 --> 02:54.831
Ryan's former Royal Navy.
Explosive ordnance disposal.

02:54.908 --> 02:56.575
After his dishonorable
discharge,

02:56.576 --> 02:59.044
he went from disposing bombs
to designing them.

02:59.045 --> 03:00.846
He's worked with The Covenant
in the past

03:00.847 --> 03:03.048
and wants to sell them
his latest product.

03:03.049 --> 03:04.583
So he displays
their effectiveness

03:04.584 --> 03:06.752
by destroying
a downtown office building?

03:06.753 --> 03:09.154
Actually, Ryan alerted
local authorities,

03:09.155 --> 03:10.856
gave them time
to evacuate the building.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.090
A humanitarian bomber.

03:12.091 --> 03:14.651
His goal was to provide
a state-of-the-art bomb squad

03:14.727 --> 03:17.196
ample opportunity
to deactivate his creation.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.498
He wanted the bomb squad
called in?

03:19.499 --> 03:20.632
Well, maybe 'cause he knew

03:20.633 --> 03:23.227
there was nothing
they could do, right?

03:24.637 --> 03:26.305
The bomb
you recovered last week.

03:26.306 --> 03:27.739
I've got that in my workshop.

03:27.740 --> 03:29.575
According to the bomb squad's
voice recording,

03:29.576 --> 03:31.009
Ryan made
one significant upgrade.

03:31.010 --> 03:33.740
Anybody ever hear
of quantum entanglement?

03:33.813 --> 03:36.313
Raise your...

03:36.950 --> 03:37.849
No.

03:37.850 --> 03:38.984
Long story short,

03:38.985 --> 03:41.353
the theory is
this bomb can't be defused.

03:41.354 --> 03:43.755
Oh, and compared
to his previous version,

03:43.756 --> 03:45.190
it's got twice the yield.

03:45.191 --> 03:47.492
Ryan indicated that
negotiations with The Covenant

03:47.493 --> 03:49.461
will be exclusive for 48 hours.

03:49.462 --> 03:52.556
If there is no agreement,
he will detonate a second bomb,

03:52.632 --> 03:54.933
targeted against America,
to elicit bids

03:54.934 --> 03:57.926
from terrorist groups
hostile to our interests.

03:58.004 --> 04:00.504
But if The Covenant is
interested in making an offer,

04:00.573 --> 04:03.041
he instructed them
to contact him tomorrow night

04:03.042 --> 04:05.177
at a pub called
the Black Stag in Belfast.

04:05.178 --> 04:06.311
Our options.

04:06.312 --> 04:08.747
Extract Ryan
and force his cooperation,

04:08.748 --> 04:12.115
or get him to do so voluntarily
by posing as The Covenant.

04:12.185 --> 04:13.218
How can we do that?

04:13.219 --> 04:15.654
We don't know their
relationship. Isn't that risky?

04:15.655 --> 04:16.822
There are variables.

04:16.822 --> 04:18.991
But if our goals are
to prevent a second bombing

04:18.992 --> 04:21.586
and to learn who Ryan's
partners might be,

04:21.661 --> 04:24.161
the best way to do that
is by gaining his trust.

04:24.230 --> 04:26.790
What about Leonid Lisenker,
The Covenant defector?

04:26.866 --> 04:27.966
He's in custody.

04:27.967 --> 04:29.501
He might be able to detail

04:29.502 --> 04:31.136
Ryan's relationship
with The Covenant.

04:31.137 --> 04:32.838
For now, we spec out
both approaches.

04:32.839 --> 04:34.406
Sydney, you question Lisenker.

04:34.407 --> 04:37.433
Vaughn, you and Weiss detail
the mission if we go in as CIA.

04:37.510 --> 04:40.010
We'll meet in two hours.

04:46.953 --> 04:49.453
I believe in America.

04:51.758 --> 04:54.522
America has given me new life.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.895
Away from The Covenant.

04:56.896 --> 05:00.423
I was hoping you could tell me
something about this man.

05:01.701 --> 05:05.034
Daniel Ryan
was critical to the I.R.A.

05:05.104 --> 05:07.205
When they were
in the bombing business.

05:07.206 --> 05:08.874
He's become
an independent contractor

05:08.875 --> 05:12.038
since Sinn Fein went
straight year before last.

05:14.347 --> 05:17.373
Your cigarettes are for crap.

05:18.384 --> 05:21.444
But I love cable television
in this country.

05:21.521 --> 05:24.183
I am enjoying very much
this picture...

05:24.257 --> 05:26.757
"Miami Vice. "

05:27.493 --> 05:30.189
Ryan is selling a new weapon
to The Covenant.

05:30.263 --> 05:33.323
We're considering acquiring it
by posing as The Covenant.

05:33.399 --> 05:35.100
For this to work,
we need you to tell us

05:35.101 --> 05:37.502
everything you know about
Ryan's interactions with them.

05:37.503 --> 05:38.970
Protocols, contacts.

05:38.971 --> 05:41.838
I was never directly
involved in procurement,

05:41.908 --> 05:44.309
but I did two deals with Ryan.

05:44.310 --> 05:46.445
I can tell you
what he will be expecting,

05:46.446 --> 05:50.780
and that his contact
is Vladimir Androjnev.

05:52.218 --> 05:54.718
How is Agent Vaughn?

05:55.288 --> 05:57.389
When you took me
from North Korea,

05:57.390 --> 06:00.416
I saw a strong connection, yes?

06:01.427 --> 06:05.420
We know the first contact
is made in Belfast.

06:05.498 --> 06:06.898
What happens after that?

06:06.899 --> 06:08.834
Where's Lauren?
I haven't seen her all day.

06:08.835 --> 06:11.269
She's in Washington.
Monthly debrief at DCI.

06:11.270 --> 06:13.338
Plus a couple days
with her family.

06:13.339 --> 06:15.140
And how is the senator?

06:15.141 --> 06:16.441
I like the senator.

06:16.442 --> 06:18.942
And how's your marriage doing?

06:24.183 --> 06:25.517
How was Lisenker?

06:25.518 --> 06:28.018
Helpful.
We should go tell Dixon.

06:30.156 --> 06:33.284
- What, I can't ask my buddy...
- Marriage is fantastic.

06:33.359 --> 06:35.859
Yeah, I can tell.

07:14.300 --> 07:16.800
How you doing there?

07:17.637 --> 07:20.137
Who are you?

07:27.246 --> 07:28.914
I'm a U.S. Federal agent.

07:28.915 --> 07:30.482
In cooperation
with local authorities,

07:30.483 --> 07:33.316
I'm placing you under arrest
for transporting explosives

07:33.386 --> 07:35.187
with an intent to kill.

07:35.188 --> 07:37.456
You've put on weight.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.957
So have you.

07:40.092 --> 07:42.592
Your friends from The Covenant
aren't here yet.

07:42.595 --> 07:45.095
Come on.
Car's out back.

07:47.733 --> 07:50.233
All right, come on, move it.

07:54.073 --> 07:57.236
There's been a mistake.
I've done nothing wrong.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.810
Tell that to the families
of your victims.

08:13.893 --> 08:16.393
Officers down!
I need help now!

08:31.277 --> 08:33.544
Ugh!

08:33.546 --> 08:35.179
We need to hurry.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.249
I'm Emma Warfield.
Androjnev sent me.

08:37.250 --> 08:38.517
This is not what we agreed.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.784
Not before your stupidity
led the CIA to the meeting.

08:40.785 --> 08:42.486
I don't know you.

08:42.488 --> 08:45.218
Every cop in the city is going
to be here in five minutes.

08:45.291 --> 08:47.791
You may not know me,
but I did you a favor.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.700
We're good.

08:56.702 --> 08:59.432
Boy Scout to Base Camp.
We've got the package.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.308
That was good, right?

09:03.309 --> 09:04.809
That's called method acting.

09:04.810 --> 09:06.645
I was shot in the neck once.

09:06.646 --> 09:08.313
I can do it again.

09:08.314 --> 09:10.814
We've got to move.

09:39.345 --> 09:40.478
According to Lisenker,

09:40.479 --> 09:42.047
Ryan does business
with The Covenant

09:42.048 --> 09:44.416
at the Commodore Hotel
in Moscow, room 305.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.851
I think it would be easier
to sic your father on him.

09:46.852 --> 09:49.187
We have 27 hours before Ryan
sets off another bomb.

09:49.188 --> 09:51.189
Our best chance to prevent that
is to let him know

09:51.190 --> 09:52.991
his first demonstration
convinced us to buy

09:52.992 --> 09:54.159
every weapon he can produce.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.194
Us being The Covenant
based on intel received

09:56.195 --> 09:58.029
from someone
we may not be able to trust.

09:58.030 --> 09:59.331
Lisenker defected.

09:59.332 --> 10:01.032
He hates The Covenant
as much as anyone,

10:01.033 --> 10:03.533
and he's all we've got.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.699
- How's the inspection going?
- Good. Whoa.

10:08.774 --> 10:10.775
Lisenker rejected
the fruit basket.

10:10.776 --> 10:12.811
Said it would cost a fortune
in Moscow.

10:12.812 --> 10:14.212
Oh, and we need a ceiling.

10:23.322 --> 10:25.757
That's actually
Russian satellite television.

10:25.758 --> 10:27.726
I hacked it off
the Dubnovysat communications.

10:27.727 --> 10:30.227
Right there.
Now lower it.

10:30.763 --> 10:32.130
Everything is to spec.

10:32.131 --> 10:34.165
The bedsheets
are 700-thread count.

10:34.166 --> 10:35.800
The minibar is stocked
with diet cola,

10:35.801 --> 10:38.203
and the hotel insignia has been
stitched into the bathrobes.

10:38.204 --> 10:40.372
What if he wants to take a walk?

10:40.373 --> 10:42.340
If he does, he can go
as far as the elevator.

10:42.341 --> 10:44.841
Once he presses "lobby,"
we're made.

10:50.549 --> 10:53.143
Okay, we're ready.

10:53.219 --> 10:55.719
You can wean him off
the methohexital.

11:06.565 --> 11:09.625
And now the soundtrack
of our lives.

11:15.141 --> 11:17.641
Here we go.

11:40.232 --> 11:42.067
Good evening, Mr. Ryan.

11:42.068 --> 11:43.601
Welcome back to the Commodore.

11:43.602 --> 11:44.803
How may I help you?

11:44.804 --> 11:46.738
You can start by telling me
how I got here.

11:46.739 --> 11:48.273
I just came on duty, sir,

11:48.274 --> 11:52.074
but you do have one message
from your attorney.

11:52.778 --> 11:53.912
My attorney?

11:53.913 --> 11:56.575
This is how Androjnev is known.
I'm sure of it.

11:58.050 --> 12:00.418
Yes, he called at 6: 15

12:00.419 --> 12:04.253
to apologize for being
unable to meet with you.

12:04.323 --> 12:06.524
The colleague he sent
in his place

12:06.525 --> 12:11.019
is fully capable of executing
the necessary documents.

12:11.764 --> 12:13.765
That is all.

12:13.766 --> 12:16.266
Thank you.

12:28.781 --> 12:31.281
Syd, you're up.

12:52.905 --> 12:55.405
You're awake.

12:55.407 --> 12:56.841
That's good.

12:56.842 --> 12:59.342
We can do business.

13:01.013 --> 13:03.513
I do business with Androjnev.

13:04.650 --> 13:07.150
Your product demonstration
in Belfast was impressive.

13:07.186 --> 13:09.654
We'd like to purchase
your new weapon.

13:09.655 --> 13:12.023
While I appreciate
your hairstyle,

13:12.024 --> 13:14.925
as I said,
I do business with Androjnev.

13:14.994 --> 13:17.622
Do you know what the CIA would
have done with you in custody?

13:17.696 --> 13:20.995
They would have executed you
as an enemy of the state.

13:21.066 --> 13:24.934
Unless you have a death wish,
you will do as I instruct.

13:25.004 --> 13:27.172
These windows have been
made bulletproof with Kevlar

13:27.173 --> 13:28.673
for your protection.

13:28.674 --> 13:30.642
Three officers,
including a CIA agent,

13:30.643 --> 13:32.377
were killed
trying to arrest you.

13:32.378 --> 13:33.745
You're all over the news.

13:33.746 --> 13:34.779
Cue the newscast.

13:34.780 --> 13:36.714
Patching it into the feed.

13:36.715 --> 13:39.215
Roll camera.

13:41.020 --> 13:43.520
Authorities...

13:48.694 --> 13:50.762
Police confirm they do have
several leads

13:50.763 --> 13:52.764
and are working to bring
the investigation

13:52.765 --> 13:54.299
to a swift conclusion.

13:54.300 --> 13:56.434
Few details have been given
to news organizations,

13:56.435 --> 13:58.870
but a photograph was released
of this man,

13:58.871 --> 14:00.572
who was not only involved
in the raid,

14:00.573 --> 14:02.774
but who police say
was responsible

14:02.775 --> 14:05.676
for the Wicklow National Bank
blast last Wednesday.

14:05.744 --> 14:09.009
The CIA is working with Interpol
as well as local law enforcement

14:09.081 --> 14:11.845
in pursuit of this man
and those responsible.

14:14.920 --> 14:16.287
You will agree to our terms

14:16.288 --> 14:18.323
and call off
the second demonstration.

14:18.324 --> 14:20.225
It's unnecessary,
and will only serve

14:20.226 --> 14:22.888
to draw unwanted attention.

14:26.098 --> 14:29.431
Before Androjnev,
my contact was Pannich.

14:29.501 --> 14:30.735
I deal with him.

14:30.736 --> 14:31.736
Okay?

14:31.737 --> 14:33.972
- It is a trap.
- You know the guy?

14:33.973 --> 14:36.737
The guy's a woman.
I must speak with Sydney.

14:37.343 --> 14:39.344
Hello, Sydney, it's Leonid.
Listen to me.

14:39.345 --> 14:42.280
Ivana Pannich is dead.
Was killed.

14:42.348 --> 14:45.613
She was killed
in Slovenia last year.

14:46.719 --> 14:49.244
You know this. That's why
your handlers were switched.

14:49.321 --> 14:50.455
Any other tests?

14:50.456 --> 14:52.924
Yeah. I don't feel safe here.
I want to leave.

14:52.925 --> 14:54.959
You leave this hotel room,
you're a dead man.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.594
You're scared I'll go
to The Covenant.

14:56.595 --> 15:00.122
In addition to being a target
of the CIA, Mr. Ryan,

15:00.199 --> 15:02.724
you are also a security risk
to The Covenant.

15:02.801 --> 15:05.895
You have information that
could compromise our operation.

15:05.971 --> 15:07.705
Was that a threat?

15:07.706 --> 15:09.107
I've been threatened before.

15:09.108 --> 15:10.541
It was like a threat.

15:10.542 --> 15:13.067
You leave this room,
I will kill you myself.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.618
There's loads of things
I'm no good at.

15:20.619 --> 15:22.587
Some I'm exceptional at.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.355
One of them is poker.

15:24.356 --> 15:26.758
Ah, I love poker.
Play twice a week.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.059
My friends come around.

15:28.060 --> 15:30.560
They bring their money.
They lose their money.

15:30.562 --> 15:32.597
I always win.
Do you know why?

15:32.598 --> 15:34.632
I can see a bluff a mile away.

15:34.633 --> 15:37.625
Take off the headset.
Do it!

15:37.703 --> 15:40.203
Not when I've got something
that you want.

15:46.512 --> 15:49.012
Mr. Ryan.

15:52.251 --> 15:54.751
You played your hand, darling.

16:01.894 --> 16:03.227
Hello, Daniel!

16:03.228 --> 16:04.929
Androjnev told me
you were in town,

16:04.930 --> 16:07.332
so I took the liberty
of coming over.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.858
Sorry.
Were you going somewhere?

16:09.935 --> 16:13.996
Um, I was, yeah,
but I can wait.

16:14.073 --> 16:16.573
Do you want to come...

16:24.883 --> 16:27.285
Hello, Emma.
It's good to see you.

16:27.286 --> 16:30.778
Leonid,
what an unexpected surprise.

16:30.856 --> 16:32.857
You vouch for this one?

16:32.858 --> 16:35.588
Daniel, I know about Belfast.

16:35.661 --> 16:38.221
Your extraction was cleared
to the highest levels.

16:38.297 --> 16:39.597
Emma saved your life.

16:39.598 --> 16:43.466
You should kiss her.
Whatever she wants.

16:53.479 --> 16:54.679
Okay.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.914
The terms are acceptable.

16:56.915 --> 16:59.415
On one condition.

16:59.718 --> 17:02.585
The details for transfer
and materials, blueprints

17:02.654 --> 17:04.489
have to be handled
by the co-chair

17:04.490 --> 17:05.990
of the North American cell.

17:05.991 --> 17:08.159
I deal directly with Mr. Sark.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.660
Okay?

17:11.797 --> 17:13.798
You're in no position
to make such a demand.

17:13.799 --> 17:16.099
As long as I've got
what you want, I am.

17:16.101 --> 17:19.730
Mr. Sark is in town on business.

17:19.805 --> 17:23.901
For an important supplier
such as yourself, I'm, uh...

17:24.476 --> 17:26.743
I'm sure he would be happy
to oblige.

17:26.744 --> 17:28.346
Happy to oblige?!

17:28.347 --> 17:30.381
- Let me explain.
- Explain what?

17:30.382 --> 17:32.784
We're not really Covenant.
We can't produce Sark.

17:32.785 --> 17:34.118
Sark has never met Ryan.

17:34.119 --> 17:35.887
Are you sure of this?

17:35.888 --> 17:37.155
Yes.

17:37.156 --> 17:39.716
That wasn't a yes.
That was a no.

17:41.193 --> 17:43.923
What I know is
the only chance you have

17:43.996 --> 17:46.464
of getting what you want
is to send someone in there

17:46.465 --> 17:49.525
posing as Mr. Sark.

17:55.874 --> 17:58.638
Mr. Ryan, I'm Julian Sark.

18:05.717 --> 18:08.217
They said you was a pretty boy.

18:11.457 --> 18:14.449
When and where
can I acquire your product?

18:21.166 --> 18:23.666
The information you need
is on a disk

18:23.702 --> 18:28.036
my associate will carry
aboard Nuage Air Flight 212.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.308
Tomorrow evening's flight
from Rome to Paris.

18:30.309 --> 18:32.809
You'll purchase two
adjacent seats on that flight.

18:32.878 --> 18:34.912
And 20 minutes outside Rome,

18:34.913 --> 18:36.848
my associate
will sit next to you,

18:36.849 --> 18:38.349
and the transfer will be made.

18:38.350 --> 18:42.480
It's elaborate,
but at 35,000 feet,

18:42.554 --> 18:45.054
no chance of surveillance.

18:45.524 --> 18:48.024
This associate.
How will I know him?

18:49.461 --> 18:51.729
You'll know him.
You've worked with him before.

18:51.730 --> 18:52.730
He's a friend.

18:52.731 --> 18:54.031
Meaning for this to work,

18:54.032 --> 18:56.167
we need the real Sark
to be on that plane.

18:56.168 --> 18:58.668
Any ideas how we can do that?

18:58.704 --> 18:59.871
The second demonstration

18:59.872 --> 19:02.773
is scheduled to take place
tomorrow afternoon.

19:03.342 --> 19:05.842
I assume it will be called off.

19:08.881 --> 19:11.082
When my associate sees you,

19:11.083 --> 19:12.617
they'll know we've come
to terms,

19:12.618 --> 19:15.118
and bring that issue to a close.

19:15.521 --> 19:16.587
We're agreed then?

19:16.588 --> 19:18.589
We are indeed, Mr. Sark.

19:18.590 --> 19:19.590
We know the frequency

19:19.591 --> 19:21.993
Ryan broadcast his initial
communiqué over, right?

19:21.994 --> 19:23.127
Yes, we intercepted it.

19:23.128 --> 19:24.729
Then to get Sark on the plane,

19:24.730 --> 19:27.597
we have to put out a communiqué
from Ryan to The Covenant

19:27.666 --> 19:29.634
which details
the terms he just laid out.

19:29.635 --> 19:30.735
If we can make Sark believe

19:30.736 --> 19:33.236
this is a way to acquire Ryan's
new technology, he may bite.

19:33.272 --> 19:35.273
How much time before he
sets off the next bomb?

19:35.274 --> 19:36.941
Less than 18 hours.

19:36.942 --> 19:39.442
Get Marshall on the intercept.
You work on the communiqué.

19:39.444 --> 19:40.645
I want you on that plane.

19:40.646 --> 19:43.672
You played Sark.
Your job now is to shadow him.

20:02.234 --> 20:03.434
The airline database

20:03.435 --> 20:05.136
shows all passengers
have checked in

20:05.137 --> 20:07.637
except
a Mr. And Mrs. Clyde Broussant.

20:19.751 --> 20:22.251
Welcome aboard, Mr. Broussant.

20:22.287 --> 20:24.655
Would you care for a glass
of wine before takeoff?

20:24.656 --> 20:26.457
That would be lovely.

20:26.458 --> 20:28.958
I've got a 20 on our mark.

20:29.428 --> 20:32.192
I have your wife listed
on the passenger manifest.

20:32.264 --> 20:34.098
She was planning
on making the trip,

20:34.099 --> 20:36.966
but she wasn't feeling
too well, the poor dear.

20:37.035 --> 20:38.936
Cheers.

20:38.937 --> 20:41.437
Maybe this will work out
after all.

20:58.724 --> 20:59.824
Sydney, it's me.

20:59.825 --> 21:01.459
Has Ryan's contact arrived?

21:01.460 --> 21:04.429
No, and something tells me
he's not going to.

21:04.496 --> 21:06.831
The approach was to be made
20 minutes after takeoff.

21:06.832 --> 21:09.528
They've been in the air
almost an hour.

21:09.601 --> 21:12.101
Tell Mr. Sark to be patient.

21:14.373 --> 21:16.873
Call your partner.
Tell him the deal's off.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.610
Afraid that won't be possible.

21:24.816 --> 21:26.450
- There is no meeting.
- Ryan made us?

21:26.451 --> 21:28.486
I don't think
there was ever a meeting.

21:28.487 --> 21:29.553
This was staged?

21:29.554 --> 21:32.182
Yes. The whole thing.
To get Sark on that plane.

21:32.257 --> 21:34.292
We're reviewing
his psych profile,

21:34.293 --> 21:37.057
re-interviewing everyone
who might give us a lead.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.929
Whatever Ryan's motive,
he has presented us

21:38.930 --> 21:40.531
with an opportunity
we must act on.

21:40.532 --> 21:42.033
You are to take Sark
into custody.

21:42.034 --> 21:44.001
We will have a team in place
when you land in Paris.

21:44.002 --> 21:46.502
I understand.

21:55.347 --> 21:56.614
Hello.

21:56.615 --> 21:59.115
Hi.

21:59.951 --> 22:01.319
I'm a federal agent.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.487
There is a suspect
I need to take into custody.

22:03.488 --> 22:06.321
It has to be done very quietly.
Is there a marshal onboard?

22:06.391 --> 22:08.891
No, I'm afraid not.

22:09.094 --> 22:11.688
Is he on the line?
Good.

22:12.698 --> 22:14.465
Tell me about Daniel Ryan.

22:14.466 --> 22:16.367
I read about what happened
in Belfast.

22:16.368 --> 22:17.802
That was a terrible tragedy.

22:17.803 --> 22:19.203
What do you know about him?

22:19.204 --> 22:22.071
Ryan is a freelance supplier
of advanced ordnance.

22:22.140 --> 22:23.908
He used to be reliably leftist.

22:23.909 --> 22:27.743
He supplied causes.
I.R.A. S, Zapatistas.

22:27.813 --> 22:29.347
Now he's strictly mercenary.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.615
- What changed?
- His brother Christopher Ryan.

22:31.616 --> 22:33.250
He's the political one.

22:33.251 --> 22:36.982
They used to work together
up until sometime last year.

22:37.055 --> 22:39.555
Christopher disappeared.

22:39.791 --> 22:43.659
The rumor is The Covenant
had him killed.

22:43.729 --> 22:47.165
The Covenant killed his brother,
and he wants to work with them?

22:47.232 --> 22:48.432
Is there anything else?

22:48.433 --> 22:51.129
No.
I'm afraid that's all I have.

22:51.203 --> 22:53.703
Thank you.

22:57.309 --> 23:00.369
Okay, Ryan's brother.
Bad dude.

23:00.445 --> 23:03.243
Bombing at the French embassy
in Rabat.

23:04.015 --> 23:06.882
Explosion at the Marine barracks
outside Manila.

23:08.920 --> 23:11.912
And the remains of a Russian
general's compound in Grozny.

23:11.990 --> 23:14.024
These incidents are all
at least two years old.

23:14.025 --> 23:15.493
Anything more recent?

23:15.494 --> 23:17.994
No, nothing.
It's like he disappeared.

23:21.900 --> 23:24.400
Sloane was telling the truth.

23:24.736 --> 23:27.236
The Covenant
did have this man killed.

23:29.274 --> 23:30.941
Dad, they had me kill him.

23:30.942 --> 23:32.676
What?

23:32.677 --> 23:35.177
During the two years
I was missing.

23:35.213 --> 23:37.014
When The Covenant tried
breaking me down

23:37.015 --> 23:39.515
to get me to work for them.

23:39.785 --> 23:43.915
When they believed I was ready,
they put me to a test.

23:48.960 --> 23:50.761
Kendall later showed me
a picture

23:50.762 --> 23:54.823
of the person
he believed they had me kill.

23:55.534 --> 23:57.802
He had no identity.

23:57.803 --> 24:00.303
Until now.

24:02.207 --> 24:05.301
If what Ryan said is true,
and Sark has been promoted

24:05.377 --> 24:07.845
to the leadership
of the North American cell,

24:07.846 --> 24:09.280
killing him
on a commercial plane

24:09.281 --> 24:13.047
carrying 200 innocent people...

24:13.118 --> 24:16.019
would be
a very public act of revenge.

24:16.655 --> 24:18.222
Oh, my God.

24:18.223 --> 24:20.723
Vaughn.

24:21.993 --> 24:24.493
Cheers.

24:26.231 --> 24:27.832
Mr. Vaughn.

24:27.833 --> 24:29.733
Tell me,
you wouldn't happen to know

24:29.734 --> 24:33.101
an eight-letter word
for "arrogant," would you?

24:33.171 --> 24:35.833
Do exactly as I tell you,
or I'll kill you.

24:40.745 --> 24:42.746
Right here.

24:42.747 --> 24:45.247
Get in.

24:48.887 --> 24:50.087
Doesn't it bother you?

24:50.088 --> 24:52.588
What's that?

24:52.591 --> 24:55.025
A bomb maker arranges
for a meeting on a plane,

24:55.026 --> 24:57.294
and then doesn't show up.

24:57.295 --> 25:00.287
I don't know about you,
but that concerns me.

25:04.302 --> 25:06.802
Lock this up.

25:07.539 --> 25:10.039
- Yeah?
- We may have a problem.

25:11.376 --> 25:13.043
An explosive device?

25:13.044 --> 25:15.842
There may be one onboard.
You have to land immediately.

25:15.914 --> 25:17.114
Syd, what you got?

25:17.115 --> 25:19.550
The bomb is the size of a CD.
It could be anywhere.

25:19.551 --> 25:21.752
Let's try and figure out
how it got onboard.

25:21.753 --> 25:24.253
Uh, crew, passenger,
maintenance.

25:24.256 --> 25:26.781
Check the plane service records
for the last week, maybe two,

25:26.858 --> 25:29.358
to see if there
was anything unscheduled.

25:29.928 --> 25:30.928
Two days ago.

25:30.929 --> 25:32.196
A work order for repairs

25:32.197 --> 25:35.132
in the electrical current bypass
in the cargo hold.

25:38.603 --> 25:41.103
Vaughn, talk to me.
What are you looking at?

25:42.874 --> 25:45.374
You better get Marshall
on the phone.

25:50.916 --> 25:53.646
- The son of a bitch lied to us.
- Yes, and we lied to him.

25:53.718 --> 25:55.753
The difference is
we were trying to save lives.

25:55.754 --> 25:58.254
Our goals are far less
asymmetrical than we assumed.

25:58.323 --> 26:01.087
Clearly Mr. Ryan shares
our antipathy for The Covenant.

26:01.159 --> 26:02.826
Except he believes
we are The Covenant.

26:02.827 --> 26:04.628
A fact we must
disabuse him of immediately.

26:04.629 --> 26:06.397
We must reveal ourselves
for who we are

26:06.398 --> 26:08.898
and take this man
into our confidence.

26:11.169 --> 26:13.137
All right, we have
confirmation from Marseilles

26:13.138 --> 26:15.638
that airspace has been cleared
for an emergency landing.

26:15.640 --> 26:18.404
The second demonstration
he warned us about. This is it.

26:18.476 --> 26:20.711
Ryan must have game-planned
for an emergency landing.

26:20.712 --> 26:22.780
If we can convince Ryan
that Sark is in custody

26:22.781 --> 26:24.114
and will be prosecuted,

26:24.115 --> 26:26.183
maybe he will deactivate
the bomb.

26:26.184 --> 26:27.484
Let's do it.

26:27.485 --> 26:28.886
That was DGSE.

26:28.887 --> 26:30.154
Four Mirage fighter jets

26:30.155 --> 26:31.822
were scrambled
by the French Air Force.

26:31.823 --> 26:34.158
To eyeball only. No shooting.
Do they understand?

26:34.159 --> 26:37.856
They are confirmed
as a fly-by... for now.

26:37.929 --> 26:39.630
This is your captain speaking.

26:39.631 --> 26:43.567
We are beginning our emergency
descent into Marseilles.

26:43.635 --> 26:45.536
Okay, the bomb
you recovered in Lisbon

26:45.537 --> 26:47.137
may be slightly different.

26:47.138 --> 26:50.630
But it should be similar enough
for me to walk you through this.

26:50.709 --> 26:51.709
What's that?

26:51.710 --> 26:53.310
What? What?
What's what?

26:53.311 --> 26:54.545
Uh, I don't know.

26:54.546 --> 26:57.242
It looks like a thermometer
with a metal ring at the top.

26:57.315 --> 26:59.815
Is the liquid rising?

27:00.518 --> 27:02.886
- Yeah. How do you know?
- It's a barometric sensor.

27:02.887 --> 27:04.288
The bomb is triggered
by altitude.

27:04.289 --> 27:06.789
If they plane keeps descending,
it will detonate.

27:11.496 --> 27:13.996
Excuse me.
You need to...

27:14.566 --> 27:16.066
Oh, mon Dieu!
What do you want now?

27:16.067 --> 27:18.661
Pull up! The bomb
is rigged to the altimeter.

27:18.737 --> 27:21.237
If we go below 18,000 feet,
we're all dead.

27:21.306 --> 27:23.866
Marseilles Approach,
this is Nuage 212.

27:23.942 --> 27:27.036
Emergency climb
to one-niner-zero.

27:28.380 --> 27:29.513
How long can we stay up?

27:29.514 --> 27:32.915
We have enough fuel for 2 hours,
maybe 21/2. But that's it.

27:39.691 --> 27:41.558
My name is Sydney Bristow.

27:41.559 --> 27:44.059
I'm a special agent
with the CIA.

27:46.231 --> 27:48.232
So today you're CIA?

27:48.233 --> 27:50.000
So...

27:50.001 --> 27:52.501
- Belfast. What was that?
- Belfast was a con.

27:52.570 --> 27:54.405
We wanted you to believe
we were Covenant

27:54.406 --> 27:56.240
so we could acquire
your new technology.

28:11.523 --> 28:14.356
- So this isn't Moscow.
- You're in Los Angeles.

28:14.426 --> 28:16.560
And we know you plan
on detonating a bomb

28:16.561 --> 28:18.162
on Nuage Air 212 as payback

28:18.163 --> 28:20.663
for what The Covenant did
to your brother.

28:23.868 --> 28:26.368
How you doing?

28:33.912 --> 28:35.579
And you?

28:35.580 --> 28:38.080
I defected two months ago.

28:38.416 --> 28:40.651
These are good people, Daniel.

28:40.652 --> 28:43.152
You should listen to them.

28:45.323 --> 28:48.690
If you want me to believe
you're Central Intelligence...

28:48.760 --> 28:50.394
you've got to do better
than this.

28:50.395 --> 28:52.895
A warehouse somewhere.

29:11.683 --> 29:14.811
Right.
Much more convincing.

29:15.854 --> 29:16.854
Mr. Ryan.

29:16.855 --> 29:19.847
I'm Marcus Dixon,
the Director of this office.

29:20.492 --> 29:23.586
We now know the bomb
you planted on Nuage Air 212

29:23.661 --> 29:24.895
is rigged to an altimeter

29:24.896 --> 29:27.490
and will detonate
if the pilot attempts to land.

29:27.565 --> 29:31.126
I am authorized to make
the following deal.

29:31.202 --> 29:32.302
Disable the bomb

29:32.303 --> 29:34.571
and turn over to us
all blueprints and material

29:34.572 --> 29:37.302
concerning the creation
and production of such bombs.

29:37.375 --> 29:40.970
In exchange, no charges
will be filed against you.

29:43.214 --> 29:45.714
If you really are CIA...

29:46.851 --> 29:49.351
...then the person I met with
wasn't Julian Sark.

29:49.387 --> 29:51.887
No, he was CIA.

29:51.956 --> 29:54.456
He's on that plane.

29:54.926 --> 29:58.657
But I told him my associate
had worked with him before

29:58.730 --> 30:01.230
and could make
a visual identification.

30:02.467 --> 30:04.601
You put the word out
to the real Sark.

30:04.602 --> 30:07.102
You let him know
there was a meeting.

30:07.639 --> 30:09.807
Clever.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.308
Full-on genius.

30:11.309 --> 30:13.076
Maybe you really are CIA.

30:13.077 --> 30:14.678
Sark is already in custody.

30:14.679 --> 30:16.013
As soon as the plane lands,

30:16.014 --> 30:17.648
he will be processed
for extradition

30:17.649 --> 30:19.950
and prosecuted to
the fullest extent of the law.

30:19.951 --> 30:22.019
The terms of our deal
expire in 10 seconds.

30:22.020 --> 30:25.012
After that,
what Agent Bristow said is true.

30:25.089 --> 30:28.855
You will be tried
as an enemy of the state

30:28.927 --> 30:30.260
and executed.

30:33.531 --> 30:36.398
You cannot let
those innocent people die.

30:38.670 --> 30:41.170
My brother was innocent.

30:45.109 --> 30:46.610
Okay, well, how about this?

30:46.611 --> 30:48.579
We have to keep the bomb
at altitude, right?

30:48.580 --> 30:50.480
Why don't we land
at a high-altitude airport?

30:50.481 --> 30:52.583
The highest-altitude airport
is in Bangda, Tibet,

30:52.584 --> 30:55.084
and that's only 14,000 feet.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.054
Wait a minute.

30:57.055 --> 30:58.288
Wait.
Wait a minute.

30:58.289 --> 30:59.723
We can't get rid of the bomb.

30:59.724 --> 31:03.387
We can't defuse the bomb,
but we can trick it.

31:03.461 --> 31:05.662
Air pressure is the force
exerted on a surface

31:05.663 --> 31:08.098
by the weight of the air above.

31:08.099 --> 31:09.833
We need to encase the bomb
in an airtight,

31:09.834 --> 31:11.068
temperature-controlled bubble.

31:11.069 --> 31:13.237
To fool the bomb into thinking
we're still at altitude.

31:13.238 --> 31:15.866
But to do that, you need to
remove it from the fuselage

31:15.940 --> 31:17.641
and deactivate
the motion sensor.

31:17.642 --> 31:20.142
Which the bomb squad in Belfast
was doing when they died.

31:20.144 --> 31:22.644
Well, yeah.

31:25.617 --> 31:27.251
Okay.

31:27.252 --> 31:28.418
All right, I see four wires

31:28.419 --> 31:30.621
leading out
from the motion sensor.

31:30.622 --> 31:32.356
Red, green, yellow, and black.

31:32.357 --> 31:35.121
Can you see which one
is looped to the power source?

31:35.193 --> 31:36.660
Yeah, the red one.

31:36.661 --> 31:39.161
Red one. Okay.
Go ahead and cut that.

31:41.199 --> 31:43.724
- No, no! Wait!
- I hate it when you do that!

31:43.801 --> 31:45.302
- Is there a suppressor?
- Yeah.

31:45.303 --> 31:46.803
Don't cut it.
It's a false lead.

31:46.804 --> 31:48.672
- Marshall!
- My bad. Sorry.

31:48.673 --> 31:51.233
Find the anti-static wire that
runs through the plasma relay.

31:51.309 --> 31:53.343
It's probably wrapped
in degaussed ceramic fiber.

31:53.344 --> 31:56.279
You have to explain this to me
in words I can understand.

31:56.347 --> 31:59.180
It could look like anything.
There are a million variations.

31:59.250 --> 32:00.684
Tell me what you're looking at.

32:00.685 --> 32:02.319
I don't know
what I'm looking at!

32:02.320 --> 32:04.820
Well, then you better find
somebody that does.

32:17.435 --> 32:19.935
Thirsty?

32:38.823 --> 32:41.553
You're angry.
With good reason.

32:44.495 --> 32:47.191
The Covenant took away
your brother's life.

32:49.100 --> 32:51.535
"Took his life. "

32:51.536 --> 32:54.036
What an interesting
choice of words.

32:54.038 --> 32:56.373
I mean, personally,
I'd have gone for something

32:56.374 --> 32:58.308
a little bit more colorful.

32:58.309 --> 33:00.377
Like, um, "murdered. "

33:00.378 --> 33:01.878
Well, even that's not...

33:01.879 --> 33:03.714
What about, um, "slaughtered"?

33:03.715 --> 33:05.515
Yeah, what about "slaughtered"?

33:05.516 --> 33:08.016
Try that.

33:10.555 --> 33:14.457
The Covenant held me captive
for almost two years.

33:14.525 --> 33:17.426
They did things to me...

33:18.229 --> 33:20.729
...I will never get over.

33:23.234 --> 33:25.734
They starved me.

33:26.504 --> 33:29.029
Subjected me to electroshock.

33:29.607 --> 33:32.107
Sensory deprivation.
They used hypnotherapy.

33:32.110 --> 33:34.411
All to convince me
I was someone else.

33:34.412 --> 33:37.176
An operative they created
named Julia Thorne.

33:40.585 --> 33:43.713
I am telling you this.

33:45.289 --> 33:46.857
It may not change anything,

33:46.858 --> 33:49.850
but you need to know that
I understand what it is like

33:49.927 --> 33:52.427
having The Covenant
take away people you love.

33:52.497 --> 33:54.997
They are evil, evil people.

33:56.868 --> 33:59.598
The thing is,
I was luckier than you.

34:02.373 --> 34:04.873
The man I love.

34:07.378 --> 34:10.245
The Covenant didn't murder him.

34:15.453 --> 34:17.953
He's on that plane.

34:18.222 --> 34:22.784
Like I said, my telling you this
may not change anything, but...

34:23.728 --> 34:26.492
I swear to you
if you disable that bomb,

34:26.563 --> 34:28.632
I will not rest
until The Covenant pays

34:28.632 --> 34:31.132
for what they've done to us.

34:32.937 --> 34:35.496
Please. I beg you.

34:37.942 --> 34:40.442
Don't do this.

34:50.888 --> 34:52.289
I've got Sark.
Talk him through it.

34:52.290 --> 34:54.790
Wait a minute.
Sark as in Mr. Sark?

34:55.193 --> 34:58.094
I understand we're looking
for a degaussed ceramic fiber.

34:58.162 --> 34:59.229
That's right.

34:59.230 --> 35:02.165
It's clear Mr. Ryan has
applied the best invariation.

35:02.233 --> 35:03.967
Cool.
Can you splice it?

35:03.968 --> 35:06.903
I could, but the dummy wire's
fixed to a suppressor.

35:06.971 --> 35:09.471
I'll have to ground it first.

35:11.809 --> 35:14.309
You're clear.

35:26.157 --> 35:29.149
All right, we have to find
something airtight to put it in.

35:42.006 --> 35:44.506
This should do it.

35:46.110 --> 35:47.611
He needs a phone.

35:47.612 --> 35:49.746
To call who?

35:49.747 --> 35:51.281
The bomb.

35:51.282 --> 35:53.016
Specifically, a pager.

35:53.017 --> 35:55.611
The bombs are wired
with a remote access protocol.

35:55.686 --> 35:56.953
I need to dial in

35:56.954 --> 35:59.454
and enter
a deactivation sequence.

36:05.897 --> 36:07.597
This is Director Dixon.

36:07.598 --> 36:10.098
Get me a secure line.

36:13.571 --> 36:16.071
Keep it steady.

36:27.118 --> 36:28.518
Yeah?

36:28.519 --> 36:31.488
Listen, Vaughn, we may have
a way out of this.

36:31.556 --> 36:32.589
594...

36:32.590 --> 36:35.889
How will they know when
the bomb has been deactivated?

36:36.460 --> 36:38.929
The red light on the detonator
will turn green.

36:38.930 --> 36:40.430
477...

36:40.431 --> 36:42.399
Vaughn, watch the light
on the detonator.

36:42.400 --> 36:43.667
It should change color.

36:43.668 --> 36:45.168
Got it.

36:45.169 --> 36:47.571
459...

36:47.572 --> 36:50.405
And now punch in 1124.

36:51.142 --> 36:53.642
My brother's birthday.

36:56.080 --> 36:57.781
Vaughn, what's going on?

36:57.782 --> 36:59.282
Nothing.
It's still red.

37:04.288 --> 37:06.788
Syd, he screwed us.

37:09.527 --> 37:11.394
Oh, my God.

37:11.395 --> 37:13.296
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

37:13.297 --> 37:16.892
Oh, my God! Oh!
Damn it!

37:19.971 --> 37:22.305
Okay, first of all, I didn't
touch anything, I swear.

37:22.306 --> 37:23.473
The bomb's been activated.

37:23.474 --> 37:26.034
- We know. We spoke to Vaughn.
- Not on the plane. In my office.

37:26.110 --> 37:28.772
The bomb in my office has been
activated. It's counting down.

37:29.347 --> 37:31.681
Ivana Pannich,
my former handler,

37:31.682 --> 37:33.850
confessed to me on the day
before she was killed

37:33.851 --> 37:36.319
that my brother had been
murdered by The Covenant,

37:36.320 --> 37:39.187
and that it was
a test of loyalty

37:39.257 --> 37:41.757
for a woman named Julia Thorne.

37:45.396 --> 37:47.896
You killed my brother.

37:48.165 --> 37:49.966
Establish a backup connection
with Langley.

37:49.967 --> 37:52.369
I want all non-essentials
removed now.

37:52.370 --> 37:54.537
We have three minutes
to reach safe distance.

37:54.538 --> 37:56.373
I want this to be
smooth and orderly.

37:56.374 --> 37:58.208
If the bombs were activated
by a phone call,

37:58.209 --> 37:59.976
the detonator must be
on a cellular network.

37:59.977 --> 38:01.911
If I can find the right signal,
I might be able

38:01.912 --> 38:04.412
to reverse-engineer
the deactivation protocol.

38:04.415 --> 38:06.915
- How much time?
- 31/2 minutes.

38:07.385 --> 38:09.219
I'll oversee transport
of the prisoner.

38:09.220 --> 38:11.720
Dixon needs your help
evacuating the rotunda.

38:11.722 --> 38:14.222
Now!

38:17.395 --> 38:18.895
Don't tell me.

38:18.896 --> 38:21.396
We've come to the point where
you coerce me into cooperating.

38:21.399 --> 38:23.899
Not exactly.

38:30.374 --> 38:33.468
In seven seconds,
you will begin to see spots.

38:33.544 --> 38:35.245
You'll think it's a white light.

38:35.246 --> 38:37.080
But I'm here to tell you

38:37.081 --> 38:40.278
the last words
I want you to hear ever!

38:40.351 --> 38:42.085
There is no white light.

38:42.086 --> 38:44.586
Not for people like you.

38:51.295 --> 38:52.562
God, what have you done?

38:52.563 --> 38:53.730
Get the defibrillator.
Hurry.

38:53.731 --> 38:56.231
I put it outside the door.

38:58.469 --> 39:00.303
He thinks
he was prepared to die.

39:00.304 --> 39:02.472
We'll see about that.

39:02.473 --> 39:04.207
Charge it to 200.

39:04.208 --> 39:05.809
You've got to start at 150.

39:05.810 --> 39:07.844
No time for that.
200 now.

39:11.048 --> 39:13.548
1, 2, 3.

39:14.385 --> 39:16.586
1, 2, 3!

39:21.158 --> 39:25.254
You give us the code
that disarms both bombs,

39:25.329 --> 39:27.397
or we do that all over again.

39:27.398 --> 39:29.898
Both bombs.

39:33.738 --> 39:36.832
- Vaughn, we have the code!
- Only 10 seconds left!

39:45.916 --> 39:48.416
- Did it work?
- Yeah, it worked.

39:48.419 --> 39:50.919
That's impressive.

39:56.861 --> 39:59.361
Ugh!

40:23.187 --> 40:25.522
French DGSE have Sark
in custody.

40:25.523 --> 40:28.549
They're coordinating with our
State Department on extradition.

40:28.626 --> 40:30.026
Is Vaughn overseeing?

40:30.027 --> 40:31.728
He's boarded a plane to the U.S.

40:31.729 --> 40:34.229
