01:33.440 --> 01:35.670
# It's a jungle out there

01:43.880 --> 01:45.711
# It's a jungle out there

02:04.080 --> 02:05.832
# It's a jungle out there. #

02:25.560 --> 02:28.160
# If you're blue
and you don't know where to go to

02:28.160 --> 02:31.760
# Why don't you go where fashion sits?

02:31.760 --> 02:33.352
# Puttin' on the Ritz

02:34.760 --> 02:36.880
# Different types who wear a day coat

02:36.880 --> 02:38.960
# Pants with stripes and cutaway coat

02:38.960 --> 02:40.960
# Perfect fits

02:40.960 --> 02:42.678
# Puttin' on the Ritz... #

02:48.520 --> 02:50.280
Once upon a time,

02:50.280 --> 02:53.480
there was a land of neon rainbows
called Kings Cross

02:53.480 --> 02:57.560
where fantasies could be bought
and nightmares walked the streets.

02:57.560 --> 02:59.840
It was a Neverland,

02:59.840 --> 03:01.760
a land on another planet,

03:01.760 --> 03:05.275
a land where a western suburbs
schoolboy called John Ibrahim...

03:07.360 --> 03:09.430
...came to seek his fortune.

03:37.640 --> 03:39.676
C'mon, Buddy!

03:44.080 --> 03:46.674
Left-right, right-left. Left!

03:47.720 --> 03:48.869
Kick his arse, Bud.

03:51.960 --> 03:54.155
Get him, Bud!

03:56.480 --> 03:58.550
C'mon! Go, Bud! Fight him!

04:04.680 --> 04:07.194
Ooh!

04:09.400 --> 04:11.240
Hey, you gotta move your feet.

04:11.240 --> 04:14.160
Move your feet!
Nice job, boys.

04:14.160 --> 04:16.390
What are you doing here?
I had a free period.

04:17.440 --> 04:19.920
What happened to your hand?
What happened?

04:19.920 --> 04:21.399
What happened?
Nothing happened.

04:21.399 --> 04:23.520
Show me your hand.
Show me your hand.

04:23.520 --> 04:25.880
Come here.
What? Piss off.

04:25.880 --> 04:27.360
Show me your hand.
It's nothing.

04:27.360 --> 04:28.873
Show me your hand!

04:30.840 --> 04:32.637
What happened?

04:34.400 --> 04:37.437
You think you're fucking cool,
don't you, Ibrahim? Dirty fuckin' Leb!

04:40.000 --> 04:42.600
So that's why you got kicked out?
I just walked out.

04:42.600 --> 04:45.160
It's him that should be expelled,
for racial vilifi-classification.

04:45.160 --> 04:48.360
Vilification.
Listen, what about your HSC?

04:48.360 --> 04:49.880
I'm done with school.
What?

04:49.880 --> 04:52.520
You're a zub, man. You know
what plans we've all got for you.

04:52.520 --> 04:54.520
Yeah, I got plans of my own.
What?

04:54.520 --> 04:56.000
Man, not this stuff again.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.440
Come on, I've been
working doors for ages.

04:58.440 --> 05:00.360
How long you been at Images for, John?

05:00.360 --> 05:02.320
18 months.
Got a bit of time under your belt!

05:02.320 --> 05:03.800
Parra's not the Cross, OK?

05:03.800 --> 05:06.280
No, it's not. You can't stop me
working here, though.

05:06.280 --> 05:08.520
Yes, I can.
Oh, come on. I could help you out.

05:08.520 --> 05:10.040
You can't even do what you're told.

05:10.040 --> 05:14.520
You're a short arse, you're gonna
get in my way. Go home. Go home. Go.

05:17.040 --> 05:19.440
Far out, man.
He just can't do what he's told.

05:19.440 --> 05:21.670
See you, Johnny.
Ahh, Johnny!

05:28.440 --> 05:31.480
Hammer...
real name Harry Hammoud...

05:31.480 --> 05:33.520
and the other boys John Ibrahim
looked up to

05:33.520 --> 05:35.960
all came from the same streets out west.

05:35.960 --> 05:39.160
Their families had emigrated
from the same part of Lebanon.

05:39.160 --> 05:42.000
They grew up together,
went to school together...

05:42.000 --> 05:43.319
...briefly.

05:49.040 --> 05:52.440
They were like brothers...
a band of up-for-anything brothers.

05:52.440 --> 05:56.160
And Hammer's particular skills...
taekwondo, hot-headedness,

05:56.160 --> 05:58.080
no regard for personal safety...

05:58.080 --> 06:00.992
earned him a reputation
for never losing a fight.

06:04.320 --> 06:06.640
And a reputation for reckless violence

06:06.640 --> 06:08.676
comes in handy when
you're collecting protection money...

06:10.760 --> 06:13.040
...which is kind of like insurance cover

06:13.040 --> 06:15.156
against acts of reckless violence.

06:30.920 --> 06:34.720
The Cross was the vice capital
of Sydney... no, make that Australia...

06:34.720 --> 06:39.880
a one-mile stretch of strip clubs,
brothels, nightclubs, discos,

06:39.880 --> 06:43.668
restaurants, coffee shops
and heartbreaking sob stories.

06:54.840 --> 06:57.640
Whatever your poison,
whatever your perversion,

06:57.640 --> 07:00.800
it was for sale on the Golden Mile.

07:00.800 --> 07:04.349
And people flooded there every night
with pockets full of cash...

07:07.040 --> 07:08.996
...moths to a neon flame.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.912
It was a licence to print money
for those who controlled Kings Cross.

07:16.320 --> 07:18.356
So, who were the kings of the Cross?

07:24.160 --> 07:27.360
The hard old men
of Sydney's underworld...

07:27.360 --> 07:30.557
George Freeman
and Lennie McPherson.

07:46.480 --> 07:49.120
Dogs! Sorcerers!

07:49.120 --> 07:50.600
The sexually immoral!

07:50.600 --> 07:54.160
You're outside the Lord's gate! Outside!

07:54.160 --> 07:58.880
Dogs! Sorcerers!
The sexually immoral!

07:58.880 --> 08:01.760
Hey, your parents know where you are?

08:01.760 --> 08:03.320
I'm an orphan.

08:03.320 --> 08:05.880
Really? What's your name.

08:05.880 --> 08:07.440
Morrison.

08:07.440 --> 08:08.520
First name?

08:08.520 --> 08:09.555
Van.

08:11.120 --> 08:12.520
You look about as Irish as I do.

08:12.520 --> 08:16.200
Arrest the little prick, officer,
and give him a slap over the head.

08:16.200 --> 08:17.920
Save me the trouble.

08:17.920 --> 08:20.120
Hey, I'm more scared of him than you.

08:20.120 --> 08:22.440
You two know each other, do you?
Ohh!

08:22.440 --> 08:24.480
We got a smart copper on our hands!

08:24.480 --> 08:25.960
We really need to be careful now!

08:25.960 --> 08:27.560
Yeah, yeah, let's get out of here, huh?

08:27.560 --> 08:29.160
I thought I told you to go home.

08:33.919 --> 08:35.520
Collecting money
for George and Lennie

08:35.520 --> 08:37.600
wasn't the only use
Hammer put his skills to.

08:37.600 --> 08:41.760
He freelanced as muscle
for most of the clubs and brothels.

08:41.760 --> 08:45.389
And a message on his pager
that said "Pink Flamingo... no ties"...

08:46.560 --> 08:49.360
...meant that matters had
got past the canapÃ© stage.

08:49.360 --> 08:51.080
Hey, what's going on? Where you off to?

08:51.080 --> 08:52.560
Pink Flamingo.
Need a hand?

08:52.560 --> 08:54.720
No, I'll page you.
You sure?

08:54.720 --> 08:57.360
Hey, stay there.
Oh, come on! Let me come with you!

08:57.360 --> 08:58.840
Stay here with us, mate.
Come on!

08:58.840 --> 09:00.600
Stay back here with us.

09:00.600 --> 09:03.400
The Golden Mile
was a law unto itself,

09:03.400 --> 09:07.951
but its denizens understood very well
the need for order.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.280
When order breaks down,
violence breaks out,

09:12.280 --> 09:14.720
punters get scared off
and the money dries up.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.553
And that cannot be tolerated.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.480
Get out!
Take it!

09:21.480 --> 09:23.198
Go him! Go him!

09:26.160 --> 09:28.680
Bouncers, doormen,
enforcers like Hammer,

09:28.680 --> 09:30.160
they all shared this love of order.

09:30.160 --> 09:33.200
So when a mob
of drunken out-of-towners

09:33.200 --> 09:34.880
overpower local security staff,

09:34.880 --> 09:37.917
peace has to be restored... and quickly.

09:41.920 --> 09:46.000
And that's what this is, by the way...
a peacekeeping exercise.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.877
Oi, sunshine!

09:52.640 --> 09:54.120
What the fuck you think you're doing?

09:54.120 --> 09:55.920
I just saved your hairy
Lebanese arse, mate.

09:55.920 --> 09:57.400
Like fuck you did.

09:57.400 --> 10:00.000
Oi, what's going on here?
Nothing.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.400
We had a report of a brawl.
Yeah, you're a bit late.

10:02.400 --> 10:04.120
Done your job for you.

10:04.120 --> 10:05.800
Is everything alright?
You guys alright in here?

10:05.800 --> 10:07.720
Yeah.

10:07.720 --> 10:10.800
What about you, sir? Are you OK?
Yeah, I'm fine.

10:10.800 --> 10:13.720
Kings Cross 51 to VKG. Everything's
pretty quiet on the street here.

10:13.720 --> 10:18.520
Fuck off! Get out of here.
Fuck off! Get out! Get out!

10:18.520 --> 10:20.351
You gotta admit,
that was a pretty good kick.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.720
Fucking overreached, mate.
Your balance was all wrong.

10:23.720 --> 10:25.800
Oh, bullshit!

10:25.800 --> 10:27.880
I'm taekwondiva, mate!

10:27.880 --> 10:30.760
First you must learn to stand.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.955
Then you must learn to fly.

10:35.280 --> 10:37.157
Yeah, Ross wants me over at Pussycats.

10:38.200 --> 10:39.918
Suppose you might as well come.

10:41.080 --> 10:43.080
Oh, you need my short arse now,
do you?

10:43.080 --> 10:44.752
I need a mascot.

10:48.720 --> 10:50.440
John Ibrahim
wasn't the only one

10:50.440 --> 10:53.280
attracted to the pots of gold
on the Golden Mile.

10:53.280 --> 10:55.200
Alright. Don't miss the bus!

10:55.200 --> 10:57.320
Good luck at the new job, Dad.
Thanks, sweetheart.

10:57.320 --> 10:58.960
'Bye, mate.

10:58.960 --> 11:00.840
Bankcard payment's due.

11:00.840 --> 11:02.990
Mm-hm. I'll see you later.

11:04.320 --> 11:06.400
Greedy coppers
could see the appeal

11:06.400 --> 11:08.720
of working in a place
where the language was money.

11:08.720 --> 11:13.360
For Detective Sergeant Trevor Haken,
a transfer to Kings Cross

11:13.360 --> 11:16.113
was like an express train
to the promised land.

11:17.400 --> 11:20.840
This is what I call
the general revenue shelf.

11:20.840 --> 11:23.760
It's for general use.
Anyone in the office can eat all of that.

11:23.760 --> 11:26.600
This shelf down here, though...
individual use only.

11:26.600 --> 11:29.360
Now, the label system
really helps out there.

11:29.360 --> 11:32.080
The fridge fairy finished
boring your balls off yet?

11:32.080 --> 11:33.640
It's a system, Chook.

11:33.640 --> 11:35.360
Come here.

11:35.360 --> 11:38.520
OK, this is Grunter.

11:38.520 --> 11:40.520
G'day, mate.
G'day. Sean.

11:40.520 --> 11:41.680
And this is Parrot.

11:41.680 --> 11:42.920
G'day.

11:42.920 --> 11:44.640
They're working on those bashings
on Macleay Street,

11:44.640 --> 11:45.720
aren't you, gentlemen?

11:45.720 --> 11:47.360
And Scully's supposed to be

11:47.360 --> 11:49.440
up to his perspiring pits
in car rebirthing,

11:49.440 --> 11:51.280
but I don't know
what the fuck he's doing.

11:51.280 --> 11:52.880
I got a lot on my plate, Chook.

11:52.880 --> 11:56.200
Why is it all the work here
comes to me? Sorry, Jimmy.

11:56.200 --> 11:58.839
Jim.
I'll call you back, mate.

12:01.720 --> 12:03.520
So what do you want me on?

12:03.520 --> 12:06.600
Oh, well, take your pick.
What've we got here?

12:06.600 --> 12:10.040
Attempt murder,
assault with a deadly weapon,

12:10.040 --> 12:13.160
bloody drug deals, soliciting...

12:13.160 --> 12:14.912
...more drug deals.

12:16.800 --> 12:19.920
I tell ya, the average punter on a
Saturday afternoon, mowing his lawn,

12:19.920 --> 12:23.040
ain't got a clue what goes on here.

12:23.040 --> 12:25.474
Well, that has its advantages.

12:27.760 --> 12:29.240
What do you reckon, Jim?

12:29.240 --> 12:31.840
You two go back a ways.

12:31.840 --> 12:34.798
What do you reckon
Sergeant Haken's good for?

12:37.720 --> 12:39.480
I'm tempted to say "Nothing."

12:39.480 --> 12:41.391
Hmm.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.036
Only joking, Trev!

12:49.880 --> 12:52.880
Look, mate... there's a joke on here.

12:52.880 --> 12:54.640
There's a big bloody joke on

12:54.640 --> 12:57.840
and there's a very good dollar
to be made every week.

13:00.040 --> 13:02.320
Oh! It's teatime, Jimbo.

13:02.320 --> 13:06.632
Why don't you take Trev out
and get us some victuals?

13:08.400 --> 13:11.153
Oh, don't forget your lunch, mate.

13:17.440 --> 13:18.873
He's a drug dealer.

13:21.280 --> 13:22.560
He's another.

13:22.560 --> 13:24.960
Who's the big bwana
in the drug trade up here?

13:24.960 --> 13:27.160
There isn't one, really.

13:27.160 --> 13:30.994
Three or four blokes
got a few drug dealers each.

13:32.760 --> 13:36.080
Though that piece of work over there

13:36.080 --> 13:38.200
has got delusions of grandeur.

13:38.200 --> 13:41.600
Bill Bayeh. He owns a gambling joint
on Bayswater Road.

13:41.600 --> 13:43.200
See the small guy?
Mm-hm.

13:43.200 --> 13:45.589
He's a fizz. They call him Captain Jack.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.680
Lunch box.

13:55.680 --> 13:57.480
Evening.
How you doing, boys?

13:57.480 --> 14:00.631
This is Sergeant Haken.
Nice to meet you, Sergeant Haken.

14:02.120 --> 14:07.433
# I've had
all the Ionesome I can stand

14:10.360 --> 14:13.960
# The playmates in the magazines

14:13.960 --> 14:18.360
# Are only ink-and-paper dreams

14:18.360 --> 14:25.080
# I'll go home with you,
just take my hand... #

14:25.080 --> 14:29.080
Mate, you should see the pavers
that I'm putting around the patio.

14:29.080 --> 14:30.640
Real flash.

14:30.640 --> 14:33.000
Yeah, that reminds me...

14:33.000 --> 14:35.240
Sculls, have you bought
that new rod yet?

14:35.240 --> 14:37.480
Nothing wrong with my old one, Chook.

14:37.480 --> 14:39.920
That'd be the one Moses used
when he was a nipper?

14:39.920 --> 14:42.798
Favourite rod.

14:44.120 --> 14:46.040
Made an arrest on that bashing.

14:46.040 --> 14:49.112
Confession?
Signed and in the can.

14:50.840 --> 14:54.440
Well! I think that deserves
a little bit of overtime then!

14:54.440 --> 14:55.920
Thanks, mate.

14:55.920 --> 14:57.760
You don't mind holding the fort,
do you, Sculls?

14:57.760 --> 14:59.840
You could do a fridge audit, mate.

15:02.040 --> 15:04.160
# I'll go home with you

15:04.160 --> 15:09.400
# I'll do anything you want me to

15:09.400 --> 15:11.840
# I've had all the Ionesome... #

15:11.840 --> 15:13.320
The Kings Cross
detectives

15:13.320 --> 15:15.470
were headed up
by the legendary Chook Fowler...

15:17.320 --> 15:20.880
# The playmates in the magazines... #

15:20.880 --> 15:22.440
...a hard man from the old school

15:22.440 --> 15:25.000
who was tougher than all the doormen,

15:25.000 --> 15:27.200
bouncers and enforcers rolled into one.

15:27.200 --> 15:29.839
Trevor Haken
had just found his role model.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.880
New recruit?

15:44.980 --> 15:47.653
I found him on the street.
He followed me home.

15:49.100 --> 15:51.020
John Ibrahim.

15:51.020 --> 15:53.220
Nice to meet you, Mr McPherson.

15:53.220 --> 15:55.580
How you going?

15:55.580 --> 15:58.174
Pleased to meet you, Mr Freeman.

16:01.220 --> 16:03.256
You can bring the car around
when you're ready.

16:10.340 --> 16:14.220
You know those new $10 notes have got
more anti-counterfeiting devices

16:14.220 --> 16:15.700
than any other money in the world?

16:15.700 --> 16:19.140
Shadow images, microprinting,

16:19.140 --> 16:20.740
even fluorescent ink.

16:20.740 --> 16:22.890
It's good to know your earn's
the real thing, eh?

16:28.520 --> 16:30.440
What the fuck was that all about?

16:30.540 --> 16:32.300
It's called networking, mate!

16:32.300 --> 16:33.900
It's called being a zub, more like it!

16:33.900 --> 16:35.572
Oh, yeah. You're a zub.

16:37.500 --> 16:38.620
Oi!

16:38.620 --> 16:40.815
They're expecting you
at the door of the Tunnel.

17:00.100 --> 17:02.620
Johnny!
Hey, Michelle.

17:02.620 --> 17:04.300
Slumming it from the 'burbs, are we?

17:04.300 --> 17:06.339
There's no law against
checking out the Cross.

17:06.339 --> 17:08.380
So are you working here now, Johnny?

17:08.380 --> 17:11.700
Yeah, I work here.
What are you, like, a bouncer?

17:11.700 --> 17:14.460
No, I'm just perusing
my future investments.

17:14.460 --> 17:15.460
What?

17:15.460 --> 17:17.099
The streets here
are paved with gold, love.

17:17.099 --> 17:18.660
Oh, is that right?

17:18.660 --> 17:21.420
So, you heard
how the school social's coming up.

17:21.420 --> 17:24.060
Kind of a shame you won't be there.

17:24.060 --> 17:26.140
Hey, who says I won't?
You can't go.

17:26.140 --> 17:27.619
You got expelled, remember?

17:27.619 --> 17:30.373
Move it!

17:39.980 --> 17:42.020
You said you wouldn't do this anymore.

17:42.020 --> 17:46.969
Come on, give me a break.
It was my welcome drinks.

18:14.820 --> 18:17.940
Here we are, boys.
- Ohh!

18:17.940 --> 18:20.170
Management at the Bourbon
wishes us a good day.

18:22.580 --> 18:24.730
There you are, mate.
Thank you, good sir.

18:26.260 --> 18:27.340
Trev.

18:29.580 --> 18:32.458
Cheers. Here's to a top evening
with the wives tonight.

18:34.340 --> 18:37.180
In Kings Cross,
morality was negotiable.

18:37.180 --> 18:40.460
One man's sin
was another man's salvation.

18:40.460 --> 18:43.460
The crooks liked to think
that they had a code of honour.

18:43.460 --> 18:45.820
Well, the dirty cops prayed
that their good deeds

18:45.820 --> 18:48.900
outweighed the kickbacks,
pay-offs and bribes

18:48.900 --> 18:51.700
that paid for the kids' teeth
and the wife's fancy shoes.

18:55.060 --> 18:56.620
Look at the freak!

18:56.620 --> 18:58.820
Every man
has his line in the sand.

18:58.820 --> 19:01.060
The Kings Cross detectives drew theirs

19:01.060 --> 19:03.260
perilously close to the water's edge.

19:03.260 --> 19:05.380
Babysitter's at 11:00.

19:05.380 --> 19:08.292
Come on,
the boys wanna show us a good time.

19:11.980 --> 19:15.980
So, who's your favourite arrest, Jim...
druggies or hookers?

19:15.980 --> 19:19.860
Maria, you know, as long as
the streets are nice and clean and safe,

19:19.860 --> 19:21.500
and the average punter's happy,

19:21.500 --> 19:23.700
I'm a happy copper.

19:23.700 --> 19:25.860
How's the kids, mate?
They must be getting bigger.

19:25.860 --> 19:27.660
Mm-hm.
You know, much bigger.

19:27.660 --> 19:30.500
Don't buy a dildo, sexy.
I'll provide the real thing for free.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.580
What'd you say to my wife?
She's your wife?

19:32.580 --> 19:34.460
Fuck me!
You pay her to get hitched to you?

19:34.460 --> 19:35.940
You wanna watch your manners, buddy.

19:35.940 --> 19:37.820
Nothing wrong with my fucking manners.

19:37.820 --> 19:38.820
Trevor, just leave it.

19:38.820 --> 19:41.540
Mate, you even look at her again,
I'll rip your fucking nuts off.

19:41.540 --> 19:43.620
I'm shitting myself, Romeo. We all are.

19:49.900 --> 19:51.413
C'mon, you...

20:01.660 --> 20:03.780
Break it up!

20:03.780 --> 20:05.213
BREAK IT UP!

20:07.220 --> 20:08.940
Everything's under control, Constable.

20:08.940 --> 20:12.020
Yeah, I can see that,
Detective Sergeant. Very controlled.

20:12.020 --> 20:15.180
Hey! You're cops!

20:15.180 --> 20:17.569
Yeah, it's your lucky day, mate.

20:21.300 --> 20:23.380
That's enough, Detective.

20:23.380 --> 20:26.140
Take these shitbags
back to the station for us, Constable.

20:26.140 --> 20:27.812
We'll sort it out there.

20:28.860 --> 20:31.658
Oh, don't break it up! Come on!

20:40.020 --> 20:42.739
You're all fucking dead!

20:44.820 --> 20:47.780
You're dead!
Should've stayed out west tonight!

20:47.780 --> 20:50.453
Fucking dead man.
Open up!

20:51.900 --> 20:54.619
Anybody home? Oi, shitbag!

20:57.060 --> 20:58.652
When you're ready!

21:00.780 --> 21:02.896
C'mon, get 'em out!

21:05.380 --> 21:06.940
Do you blokes have work to do?

21:06.940 --> 21:08.134
Go!

21:11.240 --> 21:13.520
C'mon, run along!

21:13.520 --> 21:16.159
Open the van and piss off.

21:17.760 --> 21:19.880
Hoody-hoody!

21:19.880 --> 21:21.598
Constable Webb!

21:23.640 --> 21:24.789
Ladies first.

21:26.880 --> 21:28.598
Out you come!

21:30.540 --> 21:32.820
Those guys...
they'd already started a fight in Playbirds.

21:32.820 --> 21:34.253
Maybe they had it coming.

21:36.420 --> 21:39.300
You don't think they did.
No, actually.

21:39.300 --> 21:40.860
Then why didn't you say something?

21:40.860 --> 21:43.500
It's wrong time, wrong place.
Oh!

21:43.500 --> 21:45.340
Any complaint you or I make
will go nowhere.

21:45.340 --> 21:46.820
Then things will never change,
will they?

21:46.820 --> 21:48.300
Stick our bloody heads in the sand.

21:48.300 --> 21:50.420
It's not about sticking
our heads in the sand, Deb.

21:50.420 --> 21:53.457
It's about making sure
they don't get shot off.

22:16.720 --> 22:18.438
Come in.

22:20.200 --> 22:22.520
Jimbo!

22:22.520 --> 22:24.000
Look at this!

22:25.640 --> 22:27.280
Thanks for coming up.

22:27.280 --> 22:30.080
No worries, mate.
Looking very spiffy there.

22:30.080 --> 22:32.080
Yeah, Area Command dinner.

22:32.080 --> 22:34.240
Don't have to wear it too often,
thank Christ.

22:34.240 --> 22:37.800
So, mate...

22:37.800 --> 22:39.840
Bush telegraph's flickering.
Mm-hm.

22:39.840 --> 22:42.400
You Kings Cross boys had a busy night.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.920
Just an affray, mate.

22:46.920 --> 22:48.800
10 pissed clams out on a buck's night.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.960
Give you any trouble?

22:50.960 --> 22:52.000
Nup.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.280
Word is they ended up looking like
Jeff Fenech's sparring partner.

23:01.280 --> 23:03.120
Well, they resisted arrest, didn't they?

23:03.120 --> 23:06.520
You used only necessary force?
Course.

23:06.520 --> 23:11.071
Nothing Commissioner Avery
wouldn't think was 100% kosher?

23:13.680 --> 23:15.920
You know, Den,
you and your beloved leaders

23:15.920 --> 23:17.672
have been sitting behind desks
for too long.

23:18.880 --> 23:21.840
Have you forgotten what it's like
out in the real world?

23:24.640 --> 23:26.790
Real world's changing, Jim.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.480
We're just trying to do our job.

23:29.480 --> 23:30.960
Just doing your job.

23:30.960 --> 23:33.480
You know, journos, mate,
print 'K ings Cross police brutality'

23:33.480 --> 23:35.840
and the job gets harder
for all of us, mate.

23:35.840 --> 23:38.040
What would those
bloody journos know, Den?

23:38.040 --> 23:41.240
I'd like to see them spend a day...
HALF a day... out there in the Cross

23:41.240 --> 23:43.120
dealing with the shit
that we've gotta deal with.

23:43.120 --> 23:44.680
I mean, come on... those scumbags

23:44.680 --> 23:48.320
were marching up and down Darlo Road
all night causing trouble.

23:48.320 --> 23:51.040
They insulted Trev's wife,
then they attacked us.

23:51.040 --> 23:55.320
They kicked Sean Sinclair's head
so hard he's got six stitches.

23:55.320 --> 23:58.920
Now, any sort of injuries that they have

23:58.920 --> 24:02.276
happened during the brawl
or in the process of arrest.

24:04.400 --> 24:06.360
That's what your incident reports will say.

24:06.360 --> 24:07.793
That's what happened.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.116
What's Mel Mal done, mate?
Nothing.

24:15.400 --> 24:18.160
So, why are we going there?
To kick his head in?

24:18.160 --> 24:21.640
Who says we're kicking anyone's
head in? We're just going for a drink.

24:21.640 --> 24:23.120
Johnny, here.

24:23.120 --> 24:24.872
No, no.
Alright, let's go.

24:39.560 --> 24:41.520
Hey, matey.
Detectives! Praise the Lord.

24:41.520 --> 24:43.280
Some druggies took my board.

24:43.280 --> 24:46.760
I can't impart the word of the Lord
without a board to write it on.

24:46.760 --> 24:50.080
What time was this?
About one hour ago.

24:50.080 --> 24:51.840
Whereabouts?
Up on the strip.

24:51.840 --> 24:54.200
And how many were there?
Four.

24:54.200 --> 24:58.040
How long you owned this place?
Couple of years.

24:58.040 --> 25:00.240
Yeah? You do alright?

25:00.240 --> 25:02.400
Well, turnover's great.

25:02.400 --> 25:06.560
It's one of three clubs in the Cross
that's got a 6am licence.

25:06.560 --> 25:10.160
But drugs are a problem...
half the staff's got their hands in the till

25:10.160 --> 25:11.640
and every Tom, Dick and Harry

25:11.640 --> 25:14.120
thinks they've got the right
to hit on you for a freebie.

25:14.120 --> 25:17.795
Quick licensing check, Mel.
I trust no-one's under age?

25:18.840 --> 25:21.434
I'm not drinking mate, so...

25:22.880 --> 25:26.400
You know, I file a report,
you could lose your liquor licence.

25:26.400 --> 25:28.630
Or you could just pay
an on-the-spot fine.

25:33.200 --> 25:34.680
He had you going, didn't he?

25:34.680 --> 25:36.640
C'mon, Trev. We've got
some work to do.

25:36.640 --> 25:38.517
See you, boys.
Yeah, see you later.

25:41.160 --> 25:43.920
Is there a problem?
A bit warm in there, mate.

25:43.920 --> 25:45.480
I mean, opportunity knocks
and everything,

25:45.480 --> 25:47.800
but don't you think
you were kind of brazen?

25:47.800 --> 25:49.440
I thought you'd be pleased...

25:49.440 --> 25:51.795
buy yourself a few more
flash pavers, eh?

25:54.680 --> 25:58.240
Let's see if we can hunt down
poor old bible boy's word of God.

25:58.240 --> 26:01.120
Hey, matey... what did he look like?

26:01.120 --> 26:02.838
There were four.

26:04.360 --> 26:06.440
You're too pissed
to drive Freeman home.

26:06.440 --> 26:11.240
What? What the fu... What's wrong with
you? I've been driving since before you...

26:11.240 --> 26:13.000
"I've been driving since..."

26:13.000 --> 26:14.640
Hey, you're not considering driving,
are you, Hammer?

26:14.640 --> 26:17.800
What?
How many beers have you had?

26:17.800 --> 26:20.920
I haven't had any beers!
I find that hard to believe.

26:20.920 --> 26:22.720
I'm sweet as!
How are you, sweetie?

26:22.720 --> 26:24.640
Step back please, sir.
Come home with us tonight!

26:24.640 --> 26:27.160
I want you to go home, alone.
Say hello to your mother.

26:27.160 --> 26:28.960
Oh, really? Cheeky!

26:28.960 --> 26:30.560
Alright, you guys need to take a break.

26:30.560 --> 26:32.760
Why don't you have a coffee?
Why don't you fuck off?

26:32.760 --> 26:34.760
Do you wanna spend the night
in the lock-up?

26:34.760 --> 26:38.440
You fucking cops are fucking dogs!
Step BACK, sir!

26:38.440 --> 26:40.040
You get behind the wheel of a car,

26:40.040 --> 26:42.480
I will bang you up so fast
you'll need a chequered flag.

26:42.480 --> 26:44.800
Hey, hey, no-one's driving here, officers.

26:44.800 --> 26:48.520
These lovely boys were just going up
to play a game of Manila, weren't ya?

26:48.520 --> 26:52.195
Bet Billy Bayeh's got a pocketful of cash
and he's itching to lose.

26:53.880 --> 26:55.840
Go clean him out for me, eh?

26:55.840 --> 26:57.520
Go on.

26:57.520 --> 26:59.317
I'll take care of the other. Go on.

27:00.360 --> 27:03.955
Sorry, officers. Smile, mate. Smile.

27:06.360 --> 27:07.840
See ya, sweetie.

27:07.840 --> 27:09.956
Sorry, officers.

27:31.240 --> 27:33.120
Mr Freeman.

27:33.120 --> 27:35.160
John Ibrahim.

27:35.160 --> 27:36.991
What?

27:38.360 --> 27:40.316
The boys had a busy night,
so they sent me.

27:46.400 --> 27:48.550
You got a fucking licence?

27:51.160 --> 27:52.639
Yeah, of course.

28:06.160 --> 28:08.120
That new place... what's the ask?

28:08.120 --> 28:10.040
800.

28:10.040 --> 28:11.760
Right, well, after compliance,

28:11.760 --> 28:15.958
we'd have to be getting
not less than 15% over three years.

28:30.120 --> 28:32.111
Get yourself a taxi
at the end of the road.

28:33.800 --> 28:35.680
Hey, Mr Freeman?

28:35.680 --> 28:38.600
'Compliance' means conforming, right?

28:38.600 --> 28:43.680
Like, conforming to government
regulations... safety and shit.

28:43.680 --> 28:46.120
Hey, what do you and Mr McPherson
look for in a club?

28:46.120 --> 28:49.520
Is it just the street
or does the building matter too?

28:49.520 --> 28:53.035
Didn't realise you taught basic business
to the hired muscle.

28:54.080 --> 28:59.080
Hey, I wanna be like you guys,
Mr Freeman, Mr McPherson. I wanna...

28:59.080 --> 29:01.600
I wanna be as successful
as you, you know?

29:01.600 --> 29:03.440
I wanna have what you've got.

29:03.440 --> 29:05.480
I'm sure you do.

29:05.480 --> 29:07.920
Hey, I don't wanna be
someone else's bat all my life.

29:07.920 --> 29:09.720
No offence.

29:09.720 --> 29:11.392
Cocky little shit, aren't you?

29:18.120 --> 29:19.600
You still at school?

29:19.600 --> 29:22.160
I can read, write and multiply.

29:22.160 --> 29:24.600
Nothing more school could teach me.

29:24.600 --> 29:26.033
In other words, they kicked you out.

29:28.880 --> 29:31.840
I was expelled from three schools.

29:31.840 --> 29:33.990
I left for good when I was 14.

29:38.520 --> 29:39.999
Never did me any harm.

29:55.700 --> 29:58.380
Told the Chinese to stay put.

29:58.380 --> 30:03.300
They got a whole fucking town
named after them. We get the Cross.

30:03.300 --> 30:05.180
What, you don't trust Asians?

30:05.180 --> 30:07.220
Chinks, wogs, Lebos,

30:07.220 --> 30:09.780
bog Irish, Poms, Aussies...
doesn't bother me.

30:14.460 --> 30:18.220
Me and Lennie, we've got
the casino earns east of Elizabeth Street.

30:18.220 --> 30:20.420
Hey, Georgie!
G'day, Georgie.

30:20.420 --> 30:22.380
Hey, Lennie.
G'day, darl.

30:22.380 --> 30:23.580
Sweetheart, this is John.

30:23.580 --> 30:24.700
Hi.

30:24.700 --> 30:25.780
Hi.

30:25.780 --> 30:27.260
Sweetie, the estate agent called.

30:27.260 --> 30:30.100
We can check out that place
in the Highlands this weekend.

30:30.100 --> 30:32.740
Looking forward to it, sweetheart.

30:32.740 --> 30:35.020
Hey, not too many of those.

30:35.020 --> 30:37.295
Cholesterol... it's a silent killer.

30:38.860 --> 30:40.500
Nice to meet you, John.

30:40.500 --> 30:42.331
Nice to meet you!

30:44.140 --> 30:45.698
Eyes to the front, sweetheart.

30:47.060 --> 30:49.060
Like King Arthur
with Merlin,

30:49.060 --> 30:52.740
John Ibrahim sat at George Freeman's
well-shod feet and soaked up

30:52.740 --> 30:55.980
everything the colourful racing identity
had to teach.

30:55.980 --> 30:57.940
Think of the marsupials!

30:57.940 --> 31:01.700
Two of his most important lessons
were about money and respect.

31:01.700 --> 31:03.380
You can't take something for nothing.

31:03.380 --> 31:05.540
You pay your people, you pay them well.

31:05.540 --> 31:07.460
You pay your suppliers.

31:07.460 --> 31:10.372
Fuck me, you even pay some taxes.

31:13.380 --> 31:15.300
If you're serious about making money,

31:15.300 --> 31:16.820
then you gotta stay out of trouble,

31:16.820 --> 31:18.620
and you won't stay out of trouble

31:18.620 --> 31:21.140
if you don't give people
what they've earned.

31:21.140 --> 31:23.370
And that includes respect.

31:24.660 --> 31:25.615
Especially respect.

31:28.420 --> 31:29.900
Do your time, son.

31:29.900 --> 31:31.900
Three or four years in kindy
and who knows,

31:31.900 --> 31:35.813
one day you might even know
one end of the Cross from the other.

31:43.780 --> 31:45.133
Three or four years, eh?

31:46.540 --> 31:48.019
We'll wait and see.

31:50.660 --> 31:52.580
You're fucking kidding me.
You went inside Freeman's house?

31:52.580 --> 31:54.420
Swear to God. He invited me in.

31:54.420 --> 31:57.260
Gave me a cup of tea.
You should see Freeman's missus.

31:57.260 --> 31:58.693
She is hot.

32:00.060 --> 32:02.900
What, mate?
You still think I can't handle myself?

32:02.900 --> 32:04.618
I think you're a fucking little crawler.

32:05.940 --> 32:08.460
Alright. I gotta go anyway.

32:08.460 --> 32:10.620
Where you going, bro?
School social.

32:10.620 --> 32:12.531
School social?
Yeah.

32:14.060 --> 32:15.937
Isn't he expelled?

32:17.620 --> 32:19.300
In fact, he'd been expelled

32:19.300 --> 32:23.260
and explicitly forbidden
from attending any school functions.

32:23.260 --> 32:25.580
But that wasn't John's biggest problem.

32:25.580 --> 32:30.580
The social was fancy dress, and like
Cinderella, he had nothing to wear.

32:30.580 --> 32:32.700
Oi, mate!

32:32.700 --> 32:34.780
How much for your suit?

32:34.780 --> 32:37.700
What?
The bear suit. I need it.

32:37.700 --> 32:40.900
Koalas are not bears.
Save the wilderness?

32:40.900 --> 32:43.740
Oi!
You'd steal from the environment?

32:43.740 --> 32:45.700
I don't want your money.
I need your suit.

32:45.700 --> 32:49.420
Hey, listen, I'm hiring it.
Or you can consider it a bloody donation.

32:49.420 --> 32:51.380
But I need your suit. Give me it.

32:51.380 --> 32:53.177
No. No! Fuck off!
I need your bloody suit.

32:54.540 --> 32:58.580
Ahh! Jesus! Don't fight it!

32:58.580 --> 32:59.979
Don't fight it!

33:06.060 --> 33:08.340
# Well, it's a hungry town

33:08.340 --> 33:10.340
# Where people kiss the ground

33:10.340 --> 33:12.220
# And the higher you go

33:12.220 --> 33:14.340
# That's where the feeling grows

33:14.340 --> 33:16.100
# There's a world out there

33:16.100 --> 33:17.940
# Where people just don't care... #

33:17.940 --> 33:20.500
Hey, brass nuts!
Hey! How are ya?

33:33.700 --> 33:36.580
Who's that in there?
It's me. Told you I'd come.

33:36.580 --> 33:41.380
John?! If the principal sees you,
he's gonna go mental.

33:41.380 --> 33:43.220
You'll be in so much trouble!

33:43.220 --> 33:45.620
Oh, my God! Johnny's here!
Johnny's here!

33:45.620 --> 33:47.053
He's in the koala suit!

33:50.580 --> 33:52.220
Go tell everyone he's here!

33:52.220 --> 33:54.380
# Well, it's a hungry town

33:54.380 --> 33:56.540
# Where people kiss the ground

33:56.540 --> 33:58.540
# And the higher you go

33:58.540 --> 34:00.540
# That's where the feeling grows

34:00.540 --> 34:02.340
# There's a world out there

34:02.340 --> 34:04.100
# Where people just don't care

34:04.100 --> 34:06.020
# About what's going down

34:06.020 --> 34:08.179
# Right here in hungry town

34:08.179 --> 34:10.020
# Well, it's a hungry town

34:10.020 --> 34:11.820
# Where people kiss the ground

34:11.820 --> 34:13.860
# And the higher you go

34:13.860 --> 34:15.860
# That's where the feeling grows

34:15.860 --> 34:17.780
# There's a world out there

34:17.780 --> 34:19.659
# Where people just don't care

34:19.659 --> 34:21.540
# About what's going down

34:21.540 --> 34:23.620
# Right here in hungry town... #

34:23.620 --> 34:25.540
Year 12...

34:25.540 --> 34:27.895
Year 12, a bit of shush, thanks.

34:29.219 --> 34:31.100
I know you're out there, Ibrahim.

34:31.100 --> 34:33.409
Everyone, masks off.

34:35.340 --> 34:37.012
Masks off, please.

34:44.060 --> 34:46.060
Did you see
the look on his face?

34:46.060 --> 34:48.260
Yeah, it was pretty priceless.

34:48.260 --> 34:55.219
Hey, did you know that koalas spend,
like, 18 hours of the day sleeping?

34:55.219 --> 34:56.300
Really?
Yeah.

34:56.300 --> 34:58.220
What do they do the rest of the time?

34:58.220 --> 35:01.940
They watch TV and play video games.

35:01.940 --> 35:03.420
No, I'm serious!

35:03.420 --> 35:05.700
You are not like anybody else,
you know that?

35:05.700 --> 35:07.691
That suits me just fine.

36:14.840 --> 36:16.273
Cheers, mate.

36:21.640 --> 36:23.198
Saved my arse.

36:29.720 --> 36:32.996
# I think
that we could be lovers

36:34.320 --> 36:38.800
# Why don't you take
a picture of me, boy?

36:38.800 --> 36:41.837
# I think that we could be lovers

36:43.240 --> 36:46.160
# Why don't you take a picture... #

36:46.160 --> 36:47.640
George, Lennie, Hammer,

36:47.640 --> 36:49.440
they'd all drummed it into John's skull

36:49.440 --> 36:52.520
that order on the streets was vital.

36:52.520 --> 36:56.920
Maybe that's why he decided to jump
into a fight that didn't concern him

36:56.920 --> 36:59.559
between guys he didn't even know.

37:08.840 --> 37:10.760
He's got a knife!

38:18.960 --> 38:21.800
It's over a mile
to St Vincent's Hospital.

38:21.800 --> 38:25.240
Still, on foot's probably faster
than calling an ambulance,

38:25.240 --> 38:27.920
which is important
when your liver's sliced in half,

38:27.920 --> 38:29.400
your intestines are chopped spaghetti

38:29.400 --> 38:30.833
and you've got a collapsed lung.

40:31.240 --> 40:32.832
Where's the boys?

40:37.040 --> 40:38.840
Everyone's at the mosque,
praying to Allah

40:38.840 --> 40:40.796
for not sending you to paradise.

40:41.840 --> 40:44.280
Get some rest, man.

40:44.280 --> 40:45.872
Relax.

40:57.120 --> 40:58.633
Don't worry about anything.

41:00.640 --> 41:03.040
Me and Lennie will look after you.

41:03.040 --> 41:04.996
We'll keep your pay coming.

41:07.440 --> 41:09.840
That kid you went to help,
he was one of our boys.

41:09.840 --> 41:12.195
You didn't know that?

41:17.080 --> 41:19.280
Don't know if I can do this, George.

41:19.280 --> 41:23.114
Let's just
wait and see, shall we?

41:26.640 --> 41:28.760
You're gonna be OK, John.

41:28.760 --> 41:30.193
You'll get better.

41:31.760 --> 41:34.520
But you're too pretty and too small
to be the toughest.

41:34.520 --> 41:36.272
That's what I always say.

41:37.320 --> 41:39.788
But you're smart enough
to be the smartest.

41:44.240 --> 41:47.835
Look, I gotta get home
before this 'no smoking' kills me.

43:01.040 --> 43:03.840
Once upon a time,
a young man with a bright future

43:03.840 --> 43:07.230
came to the Golden Mile
only to die an untimely death.

43:08.720 --> 43:11.678
For three long minutes,
clinically speaking.

43:15.400 --> 43:18.360
But John must have had
a guardian angel watching over him,

43:18.360 --> 43:21.033
because he got to be born again.

43:23.000 --> 43:26.959
# I'm standing here
on the ground

43:28.640 --> 43:33.589
# The sky above won't fall down

43:34.640 --> 43:39.475
# See no evil in all directions

43:40.520 --> 43:45.071
# Resolution of happiness

43:46.120 --> 43:49.680
# Things have been dark for too long... #

43:49.680 --> 43:51.680
Most of us would never dream of

43:51.680 --> 43:53.800
carving out a life for ourselves
in Kings Cross.

43:53.800 --> 43:57.960
It's a freak show...
a fantasy to be enjoyed in small doses.

43:57.960 --> 44:02.320
But for John Ibrahim, the Golden Mile
was where he had always wanted to be.

44:02.320 --> 44:04.040
# For you

44:04.040 --> 44:07.510
# Don't change a thing for me... #

44:10.120 --> 44:12.640
He always knew he belonged there.

44:12.640 --> 44:14.676
And now everybody else did too.

44:23.160 --> 44:25.037
# It's a jungle out there

44:33.680 --> 44:35.477
# It's a jungle out there

45:10.360 --> 45:11.952
# It's a jungle out there. #

44:41.320 --> 44:44.040
Once upon a time,
a waitress called Kim Hollingsworth

44:44.040 --> 44:46.315
arrived in Kings Cross
following her heart...

44:57.660 --> 44:59.180
...or to be more accurate,

44:59.180 --> 45:00.740
following a Prince Charming

45:00.740 --> 45:04.140
because he'd told her the Golden Mile
was the only place to be,

45:04.140 --> 45:05.892
the happening place.

45:07.420 --> 45:09.172
He was right.

45:32.500 --> 45:35.780
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

45:49.100 --> 45:50.940
Are you already here?

45:50.940 --> 45:54.700
Oh, my God! What are you doing?!

45:54.700 --> 45:56.860
Kim, I told you I'd meet you
in the fucking foyer!

45:56.860 --> 45:58.340
You're having sex with prostitutes?
No, look.

45:58.340 --> 46:00.900
Kim, this is, you know...
this is your fault. It is.

46:00.900 --> 46:04.740
I got needs, OK?
I have... I have sophisticated needs.

46:04.740 --> 46:07.300
And I have every right
to have them fulfilled... it's fair.

46:07.300 --> 46:10.100
You said a night for us in a fancy hotel.

46:10.100 --> 46:13.100
Kim, I wouldn't do any of this
with the other women

46:13.100 --> 46:14.900
if you weren't such a dud bloody root!

46:14.900 --> 46:16.500
You should be ashamed of yourself.

46:16.500 --> 46:19.380
Yeah, you got a sweet girl
and you say shit like that to her.

46:19.380 --> 46:22.700
Sorry, no-one asked either of you.
Just... please?

46:22.700 --> 46:24.220
You never said anything to me.
Ohh!

46:24.220 --> 46:25.980
Oh, it's never their fault.

46:25.980 --> 46:27.460
Always the lady's.
Silly knob.

46:27.460 --> 46:30.340
Sorry, is this a fucking
feminist convention or something?

46:30.340 --> 46:33.420
Is that what's... You know,
you spoil everything, Kimberley.

46:33.420 --> 46:37.340
Right, that's it. Come with us.
We'll get you a coffee.

46:37.340 --> 46:40.460
Hang on. Oi, what about my...
what about my blow job?

46:40.460 --> 46:43.100
Blow it out your arse.
"Blow it out your arse"?

46:43.100 --> 46:44.580
That's... that's charming, that is.

46:44.580 --> 46:47.940
You are a plank of wood in bed, Kim.
You starfish bitch!

46:47.940 --> 46:49.100
Fuck!

47:07.720 --> 47:09.880
I was gonna marry him.

47:09.880 --> 47:12.838
You don't want to marry
that dick, do you?

47:14.520 --> 47:16.192
Actually, yeah.

47:18.840 --> 47:20.440
He was my first.

47:20.440 --> 47:21.920
He was your first?

47:21.920 --> 47:24.600
Jeez, honey, if I married
the first bloke who fucked me,

47:24.600 --> 47:26.760
I'd be married to my uncle.

47:29.440 --> 47:31.320
So what do you do, Kim?

47:31.320 --> 47:33.160
I work in a cafe.

47:33.160 --> 47:34.720
Get tips?

47:34.720 --> 47:36.320
Not really. Thank you.

47:36.320 --> 47:39.200
If you don't mind me asking,
how much do you make a week?

47:39.200 --> 47:41.200
About 160.

47:41.200 --> 47:42.680
And you don't drink?

47:42.680 --> 47:44.680
Do you earn good money?

47:44.680 --> 47:46.560
Slow week, maybe a grand.

47:46.560 --> 47:51.160
If we're busy or I do specials,
I can make 2.

47:51.160 --> 47:54.118
$2,000?

47:55.160 --> 47:56.720
In a week?

47:56.720 --> 47:58.760
Ever thought of this line of work, Kim?

47:58.760 --> 48:02.760
What? Oh, no.

48:02.760 --> 48:06.673
I mean, I'm happy doing what I'm doing.

48:09.680 --> 48:11.920
Of course,
Kim didn't really believe that

48:11.920 --> 48:14.036
and nor did anyone else.

48:15.120 --> 48:19.079
But she wasn't ready to admit it,
not just yet.

48:32.640 --> 48:35.800
George Freeman provided
a home collection service

48:35.800 --> 48:40.400
for punters who'd somehow forgotten
to settle up their gambling debts.

48:41.660 --> 48:44.340
You got 20 seconds to come up with
George Freeman's 20 grand.

48:44.340 --> 48:46.012
They took it. They already took it!

48:47.500 --> 48:48.980
What are youse fucking doing here?

48:48.980 --> 48:50.700
Collecting for Frank Moon.
Frank Moon?

48:50.700 --> 48:52.300
I was gonna pay Mr Freeman first but...

48:52.300 --> 48:54.220
Shut up! Shut up. Don't move.

48:54.220 --> 48:56.300
You alright to wait so I can make a call?

48:57.620 --> 49:00.660
Set a limit. If you don't have the money,
don't play. You understand?

49:00.660 --> 49:01.700
Yeah, George.

49:01.700 --> 49:03.300
How often do I have to come here?

49:03.300 --> 49:05.700
Yeah, John. Uh, got a bit
of a problem here, mate.

49:05.700 --> 49:08.780
You understand what I'm saying?
Frank Moon's boys are here.

49:08.780 --> 49:11.260
Seems he had gambling debts
to him too.

49:11.260 --> 49:12.420
So?

49:12.420 --> 49:14.020
You're not fucking trying hard enough.

49:14.020 --> 49:16.300
I was wondering what you'd
like us to do. That's all.

49:16.300 --> 49:19.337
What the fuck do you think
I want you to do?

49:21.620 --> 49:23.815
Excuse my French, sweetheart.

49:27.620 --> 49:29.780
He's sending Lennie McPherson
over to sort it out.

49:29.780 --> 49:31.260
What?!

49:31.260 --> 49:33.540
We're supposed to hold you down
till he gets here.

49:35.620 --> 49:38.657
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Just give it to them!

49:40.700 --> 49:42.338
Take it.

49:43.380 --> 49:46.300
200's mine, huh?
I hope you're telling the truth.

49:46.300 --> 49:48.260
He is, Johnny. He is.
Yeah?

49:48.260 --> 49:51.218
OK. Don't spend it all at once, eh?

49:55.100 --> 49:57.340
You need some choof.

50:11.540 --> 50:14.380
Let's go, boys.
See ya.

50:14.380 --> 50:16.260
Hey, I'll catch up with you later, eh?

50:16.260 --> 50:18.820
Can we have a word?
Yeah. Kitchen.

50:18.820 --> 50:21.060
You after some more door shifts?

50:21.060 --> 50:23.620
You know we can give you
as many as you want.

50:23.620 --> 50:25.300
I want to make you an offer, actually.

50:25.300 --> 50:29.260
One I can refuse or have you got
someone waiting for me up the alley?

50:29.260 --> 50:31.899
I want to buy a share of this place, Mel.

50:34.140 --> 50:35.940
You what?

50:35.940 --> 50:38.180
I wanna buy into the Tunnel,

50:38.180 --> 50:41.140
go into partnerships with you
and the other owners.

50:41.140 --> 50:44.974
Son, a nightclub is not a kebab shop.

50:46.020 --> 50:48.136
I don't wanna own a kebab shop.

50:50.500 --> 50:53.220
You're serious. You really wanna buy in.

50:53.220 --> 50:56.540
Of course I'm serious.
Mel, this club is a place to be seen.

50:56.540 --> 50:59.700
Is it just you we'll be cosying up with

50:59.700 --> 51:03.580
or, uh, is this really an offer
from the company?

51:03.580 --> 51:05.696
It's just me, mate.

51:07.140 --> 51:09.380
So George and Lennie
don't know what you're up to?

51:09.380 --> 51:11.420
You think about this.

51:11.420 --> 51:12.900
You have me on board,

51:12.900 --> 51:15.260
you won't be paying $500 protection
every week for starters.

51:15.260 --> 51:17.020
Don't worry, I can see the advantages.

51:17.020 --> 51:20.220
Plus I'd still work the doors,
watch the other staff

51:20.220 --> 51:22.140
and get rid of all the dead weights, mate.

51:22.140 --> 51:24.340
Son, it sounds beautiful.

51:24.340 --> 51:26.220
So how much? How much for 20%?

51:26.220 --> 51:29.690
Son, the Tunnel's worth 1.5 mill.

51:35.300 --> 51:37.740
Do me cheaper for cash?

51:37.740 --> 51:39.810
I'll see you soon.

52:03.420 --> 52:05.220
John Ibrahim
saw an opportunity,

52:05.220 --> 52:08.500
grabbed it with both hands
and never looked back.

52:08.500 --> 52:10.900
That was the secret to success
on the Golden Mile...

52:10.900 --> 52:14.017
seizing the moment with both hands.

52:16.140 --> 52:18.980
Johnny, is that you?

52:18.980 --> 52:21.620
Morning, Mrs Wilson.
Just doing your bins.

52:21.620 --> 52:24.620
Up so early! You're a good boy.

52:24.620 --> 52:28.940
You tell your mother she's lucky
to have such a hardworking boy.

52:28.940 --> 52:31.090
OK. See ya.

52:34.820 --> 52:37.980
How long are you and Chook
out of the office for, Scully?

52:37.980 --> 52:39.460
About a week, I reckon.

52:39.460 --> 52:41.500
Trevor says you and Chook
are going after the bluefin.

52:41.500 --> 52:44.420
Fishy, fishy, fishy!
Mate, you tried the home-brew?

52:44.420 --> 52:46.620
8%.
Oh, yeah.

52:46.620 --> 52:48.660
You like fishing?
Yeah.

52:48.660 --> 52:53.540
Except I get bloody seasick and fish
make me get a rash all around...

52:53.540 --> 52:55.700
It does!
Why do you go, then?

52:55.700 --> 52:57.820
Give my wife a bit of a break, you know?

52:57.820 --> 52:59.300
Plus Chook needs someone
to boss around.

52:59.300 --> 53:00.860
Don't you, mate... boss me around?

53:00.860 --> 53:03.100
You bloody need it, mate. You need it!

53:05.380 --> 53:07.900
That little incident
with those thugs on Darlo Road

53:07.900 --> 53:09.380
might be coming back to haunt ya.

53:09.380 --> 53:11.780
Thanks, mate.
I thought they pleaded guilty, affray.

53:11.780 --> 53:13.620
Yeah, one of 'em works in security.

53:13.620 --> 53:15.700
He'll lose his licence
if he gets a conviction

53:15.700 --> 53:18.060
so he's changed to not guilty.

53:18.060 --> 53:21.180
Now, look, while I fully support
your version of events,

53:21.180 --> 53:22.660
this could mean more negative publicity

53:22.660 --> 53:24.140
for your blokes up the Cross.

53:24.140 --> 53:25.140
Mm-hm.

53:25.140 --> 53:27.460
We've already got pollies
screaming about corruption.

53:27.460 --> 53:30.300
Mate, steak or, um, sausage?

53:30.300 --> 53:32.131
Uh, steak, thanks, mate.

53:33.180 --> 53:34.660
So what are you saying?

53:34.660 --> 53:37.936
All I'm saying is it'd be in your best
interests to get a win up your way.

53:40.180 --> 53:44.260
Den, our arrest rates in this city
are as high as any other station.

53:44.260 --> 53:47.460
Yeah, piddling junkies
and two-bit drug dealers.

53:47.460 --> 53:49.300
I'm talking major bust.

53:49.300 --> 53:50.780
You know, one that gets headlines,

53:50.780 --> 53:54.380
makes you blokes look like
a cross between Serpico and Jesus.

53:54.380 --> 53:56.450
Which we are.

53:58.580 --> 54:02.619
Just do something good
and be seen doing it.

54:22.120 --> 54:25.476
# I can't get to sleep tonight

54:29.120 --> 54:32.430
# I've been thinking of you all day long

54:34.560 --> 54:36.755
# You know I'm playing with you now... #

54:44.920 --> 54:47.320
Your target is Bill Bayeh.

54:47.320 --> 54:49.470
Major heroin dealer of these parts.

54:51.640 --> 54:55.240
Well, our information
has him mid-range at best.

54:55.240 --> 54:57.720
Well, everything we're hearing
from the coalface

54:57.720 --> 55:00.280
says he's ambitious, moving up.

55:00.280 --> 55:03.040
Got a big shipment coming in from Asia.

55:03.040 --> 55:05.200
You see, this gives us an opportunity

55:05.200 --> 55:08.040
to actually make a dent
inside the smack trade,

55:08.040 --> 55:10.040
you know, instead of pissing
our fine efforts

55:10.040 --> 55:11.473
up against the wall.

55:13.280 --> 55:15.560
What's your plan?

55:15.560 --> 55:17.869
Well, we've nabbed
one of Bayeh's street dealers.

55:20.600 --> 55:22.636
Ali Ghazzawie.

55:23.880 --> 55:25.760
Got a record as long as a donkey's dick.

55:25.760 --> 55:27.830
Donkey's tail, sorry.

55:29.320 --> 55:32.280
We explained to him
that he could either do 5 to 10

55:32.280 --> 55:33.880
for dealing in prohibited substances

55:33.880 --> 55:37.270
or he could do himself, and us, a favour.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.200
So he's agreed to meet with Bayeh,

55:43.200 --> 55:45.280
and put a request in
for a large quantity of heroin

55:45.280 --> 55:48.080
to sell to his Leb mates
back in Parramatta.

55:48.080 --> 55:50.440
So what we do is we give Ali the cash,

55:50.440 --> 55:52.560
we organise a place for the exchange

55:52.560 --> 55:56.240
and when Bayeh
hands over the smack... bam!...

55:56.240 --> 55:58.160
we nab him for the lot.

55:58.160 --> 56:00.880
So what do you want from the AFP?

56:00.880 --> 56:02.518
A gold star?

56:04.080 --> 56:08.920
Inspector Lloyd, the only way
a rat-smart drug dealer like Bayeh

56:08.920 --> 56:11.200
is gonna go for a deal like this

56:11.200 --> 56:13.360
is if he's offered big numbers.

56:13.360 --> 56:15.800
Anything pissy
and he'll smell a set-up a mile off.

56:15.800 --> 56:17.280
How much is he selling?

56:17.280 --> 56:19.200
Two kilos, 75% pure.

56:19.200 --> 56:20.920
Street value... $1.4 million.

56:20.920 --> 56:23.680
Wholesale value...
About 200 grand.

56:23.680 --> 56:25.200
So you know what we're up against.

56:25.200 --> 56:30.040
Us State coppers can't raise
that sort of cash, but you Feds can.

56:30.040 --> 56:32.760
$200,000 is a lot of money.

56:32.760 --> 56:35.479
Well, Bayeh's a lot of dealer.

56:39.200 --> 56:43.000
I'd have to be across
all the planning. Every detail.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.400
Absolutely... joint operation,

56:45.400 --> 56:47.280
including sharing in the glory

56:47.280 --> 56:49.919
when we make one of the biggest
drug busts in this city.

57:09.780 --> 57:13.773
Honey, I'm... I'm really sorry.

57:18.380 --> 57:21.258
You know I don't like cut flowers.
It's killing them.

57:23.100 --> 57:25.739
Oh. I forgot.

57:35.060 --> 57:37.140
You won't do it again?

57:37.140 --> 57:40.576
I won't do it again. I won't.

57:42.500 --> 57:44.377
You know I love you.

58:52.100 --> 58:53.580
Hey, honey.

58:53.580 --> 58:57.414
Did you take money out of my purse?
Aren't you meant to be at work?

58:58.980 --> 59:01.369
I had $70 in there.
Now there's only $15.

59:02.420 --> 59:05.700
Well, you spent it and you forgot about it.
No, I didn't!

59:05.700 --> 59:08.100
I didn't fucking take it!
Well, where is it, then?

59:08.100 --> 59:11.092
You tell me you love me
and you give me shit all the time.

59:17.140 --> 59:18.620
I don't know what to do.

59:18.620 --> 59:23.660
He steals from you,
he screws other women, he's into drugs.

59:23.660 --> 59:25.651
Kim, it doesn't take a brain surgeon.

59:26.940 --> 59:28.420
You're not still stuck on the idea

59:28.420 --> 59:31.060
that if you sleep with a guy
you've gotta marry him, are you?

59:31.060 --> 59:33.780
It's not that weird.

59:33.780 --> 59:35.452
Oh, yes, it is!

59:36.500 --> 59:40.260
Anyway, I need money to move out.
I need a bond and a week's rent.

59:40.260 --> 59:42.300
That's gonna take me
bloody weeks to save up.

59:42.300 --> 59:43.780
So get a better job.

59:43.780 --> 59:46.852
At high school you always said
you wanted to be a copper.

59:49.980 --> 59:51.900
"Make your fantasies come true."

59:51.900 --> 59:53.580
What?

59:53.580 --> 59:56.020
"Stacey, blonde and buxom."

59:56.020 --> 59:59.900
Didn't you say those hookers you met
earned, like, two grand a week?

59:59.900 --> 01:00:03.300
Yeah, for having sex
with men they don't know.

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:06.060
So I do that practically every Friday night

01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:09.100
and the only thing I get out of it
is a couple of lousy tequilas.

01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:12.940
Come on, my bank bill is off the planet.

01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:17.060
I know a girl.
She worked for an escort agency.

01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:19.340
It'd be alright, I reckon.

01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:21.535
Maybe I am to blame.

01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:26.170
Trent says I'm frigid.

01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:28.733
Maybe you are.

01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:36.780
Come on, fellas. Live show!

01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:38.213
Come on in!

01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:51.860
Have you talked
to your partners yet?

01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:54.055
I told them you were
knee-high to a grasshopper.

01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:56.580
But they could see the advantage

01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:58.580
of going with someone with your, um...

01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:02.780
...youthful enthusiasm
and particular skills.

01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:05.620
For 140,000.

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:07.140
With a deposit of what?

01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:09.017
70.

01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:19.133
Boys.

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:25.213
Hey, George.

01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:29.700
Can you hold this for me?

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:36.020
Actually, you know what?
Can you hold all my pay from now on?

01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:39.140
You know, be my bank.

01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:41.017
You'll be asking for interest next.

01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:44.660
You saving for something special, John?

01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:46.300
You know, I just see these other pricks,

01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:48.370
money goes through their hands
like water.

01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:52.935
Haven't got money in your pocket,
you can't spend it, can ya?

01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:58.896
Thanks, George.

01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:11.180
Ambitious copper
Dennis Kelly

01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:14.540
was another man who understood
the importance of seizing the day.

01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:16.900
He knew a golden opportunity
when he saw one.

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:18.380
You watch it, Davo.

01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:21.980
And Dennis NEVER
looked a gift horse in the mouth.

01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:23.460
Excuse me, Inspector.

01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:25.660
Ah, Mr Wu, another fantastic spread.

01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:27.140
Thank you.
Thank you, yes.

01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:31.460
Apologies for intruding,
but my wife's nephew...

01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:34.540
you recall he got into some trouble.

01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:37.140
Armed robbery and got six years, hmm?

01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:40.420
Yes, yes, foolish boy
who deserved his sentence.

01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:42.180
Oh, he should be due for release soon.

01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:44.980
We figured he will be deported.

01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:49.849
He intended applying for permanent
residency, but this incident...

01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:54.340
How is the boy doing these days?

01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:57.013
Ashamed of his past. Reformed.

01:02:58.060 --> 01:02:59.540
And if he were to stay?

01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:03.180
I would give him a job.
The family would be very, very strict.

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:06.020
He just needs this chance.

01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:10.180
We would be most, MOST grateful.

01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:12.620
# He said,
"Hey, what's your name?"

01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:15.532
# She said, "Touch me"

01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:19.740
# He said, "Girl, what's your name?"

01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:23.050
# She said, "Touch me"

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:27.420
# I'll show you everything
there is to show

01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:30.180
# I'll teach you things
you don't even know

01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:32.820
# We're going down to the river

01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:35.778
# Then we're gonna go deeper

01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:38.700
# Go deeper

01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:40.820
# Go deeper... #

01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:53.900
The exchange point is here.

01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:57.980
Unmarked units here, here, here.

01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:02.940
Marked units for backup should remain
in constant radio contact but out of sight.

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:05.820
Now, Bayeh's likely to arrive
in his car which is a...

01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:07.140
Blue Merc.
Thank you.

01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:11.700
And Mr Ghazzawie will approach
down Waratah Street on foot.

01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:14.220
No-one goes in until
the exchange has happened, OK?

01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:16.100
We want to get him for the lot.

01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:17.700
Someone goes off half-cocked,

01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:20.100
someone goes in before
he's actually handed over the smack

01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:22.780
and taken the money,
then we lose half our charge sheet

01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:25.700
and no-one gets any thanks
of a grateful nation.

01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:28.055
Any questions?

01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:32.776
OK. Let's make it a good one.

01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:42.897
Make the call.

01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:53.980
Hello.

01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:56.335
I got the cash. It's all set.

01:04:57.620 --> 01:04:59.099
Good.

01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:32.420
OK, here they come.

01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:33.853
Here.

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:40.100
That is not a Mercedes.

01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:41.700
Yeah, but it's Bayeh.

01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:44.180
I can't see the driver.

01:05:44.180 --> 01:05:46.375
Just hand it over.

01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:53.060
Oh, shit.

01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:56.060
All units, go, go, go!
Come on, go!

01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:01.420
What the fuck happened?!

01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:03.980
It's a late model Ford...
A Commodore possibly.

01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:05.300
Shit!

01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:08.420
Registration number...
There is no plates, OK?

01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:11.537
Approach suspect with caution,
could be armed.

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:15.192
Left, left, left!

01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:21.560
OK, vehicle travelling north,
heading towards...

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.471
Turning left into the transport yards.

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:30.358
We lose him in here, we're fucked.

01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:33.509
Jesus!

01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:36.511
What are you trying to do? Kill us?!

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:43.993
Jeez, mate, you're not Brockie.

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:48.957
Are we even sure it's Bayeh in the car?

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:56.520
Car travelling south on the service lane.

01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:58.715
All units converge at the southern end.

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:03.192
Left, left, left, left!

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:07.117
Back up! Back up!

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:10.680
Back, back, back, back!

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:12.557
Oh!
Fucking hell!

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:16.068
There he is. He's gone
straight out through the gate!

01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:25.560
Unit four, we've lost visuals.
Do you have them?

01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:28.880
Negative, sir.
We lost him.

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:29.949
Fuck!

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:42.600
Ali Ghazzawie
was found two hours later

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.080
in a back lane in Marrickville.

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:46.160
I'm looking into the window
and it wasn't Bill.

01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:48.080
It was two other clams
I've never seen before.

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:51.480
One of them's all, "Bill sent me."
And I'm all, "Where's the smack?"

01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:54.000
He's all, "Get in the fucking car,
I'll take you to it."

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.560
And I'm all, "No fucking way
am I getting in your car!"

01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:58.800
And he's all, "Get in the car, dickhead."

01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:00.760
And then he fucking pulls a gun on me

01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:03.000
and I'm all,
"Don't fucking shoot me, OK?"

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.798
And he's all, "I won't shoot you
if you get in the fuckin' car!"

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:11.000
What happened to the money?

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.960
I don't fucking know.

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:14.712
I blacked out when they gave me this.

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:27.720
What happened
to the money?

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:30.080
Good question.

01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:32.469
# I want to see you

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:37.152
# I want to see you twisted around

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:41.350
# Yeah, you want to change

01:08:42.439 --> 01:08:45.319
# You should be moving it around... #

01:08:45.319 --> 01:08:47.310
About here will do.

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:50.153
Cheerio, mate.

01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:55.080
# You can waste it when you've got it

01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:58.834
# You can stop your baby crying... #

01:09:01.279 --> 01:09:04.988
That Federal 200,000
had to go around a fair few people.

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:14.520
But as they said back then,
everyone got a drink out of it.

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:17.716
Everyone in on the joke, that is.

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:24.000
There was talk, of course,

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.319
and plenty of people suspected a scam.

01:09:26.319 --> 01:09:28.160
But knowing corruption exists
is one thing.

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:30.720
Proving it, well, that's something else.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.359
G'day, fellas.

01:09:34.359 --> 01:09:35.760
Hey, Trev.

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:37.193
How was the fishing trip?

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:42.120
Beauty.

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:43.840
Hey, Chook, happy birthday, mate.

01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:46.359
Present for ya.
Oh, thanks, Trev.

01:09:46.359 --> 01:09:48.960
Sculls, one for you too, mate.
Buy yourself that new rod, eh?

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:51.076
Enjoy.
Thanks, Trev.

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:07.000
For years, Independent
New South Wales MP John Hatton

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.470
had run a crusade
against police corruption.

01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:14.360
So far, he'd failed to get
the numbers in parliament

01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:16.800
for the royal commission he wanted,

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:19.440
but the media were beginning
to get behind him

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:22.557
and a few senior officers could see
which way the wind was blowing.

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:27.480
Nose to the grindstone.
Good to see, mate.

01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:28.960
Slumming it, sir?

01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:31.560
You're invited to a party Friday night.

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:33.280
What's the occasion?

01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:35.748
The dawning of the Age of Aquarius.

01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:44.360
That party
became the stuff of legend.

01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:46.840
Assistant commissioners,
chief supers, supers,

01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:49.840
chief inspectors, the odd inspector...

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:53.355
they put their heads together
and drew a line in the sand.

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:56.000
Whether Hatton gets his
royal commission or not,

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.760
these are changing times.

01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:59.840
Old ways belong to old times.

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:01.320
Exactly.

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:04.880
Rule a line, turn the page.
It's the only way forward.

01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:24.000
Ha-ha!

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Holy moly. Look at you!

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:31.600
Chief Inspector Kelly.
Fuck me for a queen.

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:35.360
Many happy returns, mate.
Thank you very much, Dennis. Cheers.

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:38.200
So who do you have to root
to get one of those, mate?

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:40.560
Ah, I chucked
my hat in the ring, got lucky.

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:44.160
Good on ya, mate.
Congratulations.

01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:49.360
You didn't take my advice.

01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:53.360
Mate, I hang off your
every fucking word. You know that.

01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:57.880
Well, I don't remember advising you
to rip off the Feds 200 grand, mate.

01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:00.560
Oh, God, come on, Den!

01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:02.760
No-one got hurt, did they?

01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:04.880
Through to the keeper.

01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:07.600
The word is from above
we've gotta keep our noses clean.

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:09.080
Yeah, yeah.

01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:13.760
You know, those fucking desk jockeys
and their fucking gabfest...

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:15.400
there's nothing in it.

01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:17.680
That's not how I saw it, mate.

01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:19.511
I saw it as a warning.

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:26.916
You were at that meeting?

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:30.440
Well, well, well.

01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:32.520
Moving up in the world are we, matey?

01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:33.953
Playing with the big fellas.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.240
Well, good on you, mate. Fair dinkum.

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:40.320
Ohh!

01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:44.240
Hello.

01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:47.400
Hello.

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:51.000
Are you not hungry, Piggy, huh? Why?

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.040
Probably still full from last night.

01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:54.800
Had a mountain of fish,
didn't you, Piglet?

01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:57.519
I might take her for a check-up.

01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:15.400
What the fuck?!

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:17.560
There was over $300 in there!

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:19.160
Well, I didn't fucking take it!

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:22.240
Don't lie to me! You took it
and you shoved it up your nose!

01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:24.240
Kim!

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:26.000
Ohh!

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.560
So what if I fucking did?!

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:31.920
Jesus.

01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:34.354
Need a bit of relief
living with you, you mental bitch.

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:38.320
Oh, Kim, I'm the best thing in your life.

01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:39.753
Don't pretend I'm not!

01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:20.600
Um, excuse me.
What you want?

01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:23.194
Uh, just the Yellow Pages, please.

01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:27.038
Thank you.

01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:57.020
Morning, Mrs Freeman.
Is George there?

01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:07.700
Thanks.

01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:12.420
George. Yeah, just wondering
if we can organise my payday.

01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:17.657
So what made you
choose us?

01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:23.780
Um, your ad was probably the classiest.

01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:28.140
It pays to spend
that little bit extra, doesn't it?

01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:31.860
Now, have you done
any escort work before?

01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:33.340
No.

01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:34.820
But we're up for it.

01:15:34.820 --> 01:15:38.500
Lovely. Our girls are all so happy.

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:43.380
No complaints. And the nicest clients.

01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:48.620
Now, are you aware
that escorting involves nudity?

01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:50.820
You'll have to take your clothes off.

01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:53.015
And it can involve sex.

01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:56.940
What's the pay like?

01:15:56.940 --> 01:15:58.700
$250 for two hours.

01:15:58.700 --> 01:16:03.020
Clients call us, we page you,
you phone us for the address.

01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:05.660
We take $100 in fees

01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:08.420
and you lovely ladies get to keep the rest.

01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:29.900
# Take him out of love
He's been there before

01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:33.500
# He knows the feeling it can give

01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:37.620
# Loss of memory, lots of indecision

01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:41.860
# Doesn't know who to believe, oh-oh

01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:45.860
# Well, I know the merits of a motion

01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:49.820
# Directed to the man in me, oh

01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:52.460
# I'll be as good as the next best boy

01:16:52.460 --> 01:16:57.340
# But you know what I really need

01:16:57.340 --> 01:17:00.460
# All I need to get is stimulation

01:17:00.460 --> 01:17:04.540
# So get me up against the wall

01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:08.220
# You know I need it, stimulation

01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:11.700
# But I never thought you'd be that bold

01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:15.700
# Oh, oh, oh

01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:19.020
# Oh, oh, oh, oh

01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:23.260
# Oh, oh, oh... #

01:17:23.260 --> 01:17:24.693
500 short.

01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:28.140
Who hasn't paid?

01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:30.300
The Tunnel.

01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:32.780
They won't be paying anymore.

01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:35.100
What makes them so special?

01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:36.579
I bought the place.

01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:39.660
You what?

01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:41.616
I bought into the Tunnel. 20%.

01:17:42.660 --> 01:17:47.540
I figure I don't need to pay myself
to protect the place.

01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:54.460
You got some balls, son.

01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:05.658
He's a shifty little fuck.

01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:09.860
I'm not sure about shifty,
but he was definitely cheeky.

01:18:09.860 --> 01:18:14.570
In fact, he was still too young
to buy a beer in his own nightclub.

01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:21.855
You're not gonna bail out, are you?

01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:26.180
No. I'm only doing this
a couple of times, though.

01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:28.780
The minute I've got a bond, I'm out.

01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:31.460
Yep... me too.

01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:34.260
You liar!

01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:40.173
It's me.

01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:49.932
Hi, it's Belinda.

01:18:50.980 --> 01:18:53.260
Yep. Yeah, I know the place.

01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:54.693
OK.

01:18:55.900 --> 01:18:57.856
Some place in Coogee.

01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:03.931
Last one to make a grand's
a rotten root.

01:19:07.060 --> 01:19:09.699
'Bye!

01:20:16.300 --> 01:20:17.780
You from the agency?

01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:19.213
Mm-hm.

01:20:20.260 --> 01:20:21.375
Come on in.

01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:42.660
Thank you.

01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:44.580
You want a drink?

01:20:44.580 --> 01:20:46.491
Oh, no, thanks.

01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:56.037
Just a blow job will be fine.

01:20:57.680 --> 01:20:59.160
Pardon?

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:00.991
A blow job.

01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:04.395
Then maybe you can play with yourself.

01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:46.313
What are you doing?

01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:50.200
Isn't that right?

01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:52.077
Haven't you done this before?

01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:54.720
No.

01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:56.790
Shit!

01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:14.360
You know, you might be a bit

01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:16.351
too straight for this sort of work.

01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:58.919
# Sometimes
when this place gets kind of empty

01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:07.758
# The sound of your breath
fades with the light

01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:12.440
# I think about this

01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:16.760
# Loveless fascination

01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:21.436
# Under the Milky Way tonight

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.470
# Lower the curtain down on Memphis

01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:33.960
# Lower the curtain down... #

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:35.916
Where've you been?

01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:41.592
Why are you dressed like that?

01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:44.960
Fuck!

01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:46.996
You want a whore?

01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:49.314
You got one.

01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:52.960
Now fuck off out of my life.

01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:58.432
# Wish I knew what you were looking for

01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:03.480
# I might have known
what you would find... #

01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:07.040
Kim Hollingsworth
took her chance, seized her destiny,

01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:09.000
empowered herself.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.280
But part of her brain was screaming.

01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:15.512
Had she just sold her soul
for the price of the rent?

01:25:16.305 --> 01:25:22.349
