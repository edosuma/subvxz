00:01.914 --> 00:03.394
Hello, welcome aboard.

00:03.394 --> 00:06.571
- Hi, I'’m Lily, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

00:08.834 --> 00:10.097
Doesn'’t know how to steam.

00:10.097 --> 00:11.794
I just want to make
sure my underwear

00:11.794 --> 00:13.665
make it back to my cabin.

00:13.665 --> 00:15.015
Oh, my God.

00:16.668 --> 00:19.715
My pet peeve, if you say done,
I assume it'’s done.

00:19.715 --> 00:22.500
It takes a lot of
work to manage Lily.

00:22.500 --> 00:25.634
I'’m trying to find the how.

00:25.634 --> 00:26.678
Sorry.

00:26.678 --> 00:28.593
I'’m so----ing excited.

00:28.593 --> 00:31.074
Michael Stevens is the CEO of
a dental implant company

00:31.074 --> 00:32.119
in California.

00:32.119 --> 00:34.338
- To a good trip!
- Woo!

00:34.338 --> 00:36.862
These dentists are having
the best time of their life.

00:36.862 --> 00:39.648
Where were these guys when I
was getting my teeth extracted?

00:46.742 --> 00:48.744
I see Kyle and I see drama.

00:50.485 --> 00:52.139
Jack, I know the game
you'’re playing.

00:52.139 --> 00:56.360
Lily'’s already being influenced
by Jack of who I am.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.323
Who stays up late?

01:02.323 --> 01:03.933
I'’m on 'til 12.

01:03.933 --> 01:05.848
From 12 till 3, that'’s when
I'’m running up and down.

01:05.848 --> 01:07.850
I'’m making cocktails and that's
what killed me last time.

01:07.850 --> 01:11.071
This charter is so busy, like if
the guests are staying up late,

01:11.071 --> 01:12.985
then you have to change
a schedule to always

01:12.985 --> 01:14.683
have someone up late
with interior.

01:14.683 --> 01:17.686
Who hasn'’t gone on a break?
No one'’s gone on a break.

01:17.686 --> 01:18.948
On a break?

01:18.948 --> 01:20.254
We'’ll figure it out.

01:22.430 --> 01:24.954
<i>Do we have any deckhand
available to carry things up?</i>

01:24.954 --> 01:27.043
<i>Where are the deckhands?</i>

01:27.043 --> 01:28.436
Max, where are you guys?

01:28.436 --> 01:30.351
Luka'’s been on boats long enough

01:30.351 --> 01:32.657
to know that you can'’t just
leave on anchor watch.

01:35.399 --> 01:37.009
I need someone on deck.

01:37.009 --> 01:38.228
I'’m not very happy.

01:38.228 --> 01:40.056
The priority is the food.

01:40.056 --> 01:41.275
Get Max up.

01:41.275 --> 01:42.885
You gotta figure
your schedule out.

01:42.885 --> 01:44.147
They didn'’t get their breaks.

01:44.147 --> 01:45.453
No, like when she calls
and calls,

01:45.453 --> 01:47.019
the deck crew needs
to----ing answer.

01:47.019 --> 01:48.195
Okay.

01:48.195 --> 01:49.587
ing hell.

01:52.068 --> 01:53.722
This is the stuff
that makes me mad.

01:53.722 --> 01:55.593
Okay, it'’s just they
didn'’t get their breaks.

01:55.593 --> 01:57.117
Yeah, like when she calls
and calls,

01:57.117 --> 01:59.815
the deck crew needs
to----ing answer.

01:59.815 --> 02:01.730
- Get Max up.
- Okay.

02:03.949 --> 02:05.429
Can I clear for you, yeah?

02:07.953 --> 02:09.868
You can start plating as
soon as you'’re ready.

02:09.868 --> 02:10.869
- Really?
- Don'’t even wait.

02:10.869 --> 02:12.132
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

02:14.003 --> 02:15.396
Master wants red wine, please.

02:15.396 --> 02:16.875
Can we get some help
for a little bit?

02:18.573 --> 02:20.140
I understand where
Sandy'’s coming from.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.663
I was off the boat, fair enough.

02:21.663 --> 02:23.621
But there were four
- ing stews working.

02:23.621 --> 02:25.362
They shouldn'’t be
calling us first.

02:25.362 --> 02:27.190
They need to call
the rest of their team.

02:27.190 --> 02:29.801
If they are super busy
and they need our help,

02:29.801 --> 02:31.107
then they can call us.

02:31.107 --> 02:32.804
Man, it makes me mad.

02:32.804 --> 02:35.155
Dude, this is----ing awesome.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.552
What'’s up, bro?

02:44.773 --> 02:46.427
Wait, you know there'’s
towels in that closet.

02:46.427 --> 02:47.819
I couldn'’t see any.

02:49.038 --> 02:50.213
Oh, God.

02:52.215 --> 02:53.521
You have a bracelet
with your name on it,

02:53.521 --> 02:56.263
is that in case you forget?
- ing idiot.

02:56.263 --> 02:57.612
No, my son made this for me.

02:57.612 --> 02:58.830
Of course I'’m gonna wear it.

02:58.830 --> 03:00.005
- Luka.
- Yeah.

03:00.005 --> 03:01.442
Let Chef know we cleared
the table.

03:01.442 --> 03:02.791
We'’re ready when he is.

03:02.791 --> 03:04.140
- Ready when you are.
- Okay, they can go.

03:04.140 --> 03:05.402
- We need to help.
- With what?

03:05.402 --> 03:06.664
Taking the plates up.

03:10.059 --> 03:11.626
- Thank you.
- There you go.

03:11.626 --> 03:15.847
This is a roast wild branzino,
fricassee of wild mushrooms.

03:15.847 --> 03:16.935
Very nice.

03:16.935 --> 03:18.023
And some roast butter sauce.

03:18.023 --> 03:19.155
- So good.
- Bon appetit.

03:19.155 --> 03:20.374
Enjoy.

03:22.550 --> 03:24.160
Interior, interior,
how are cabins going?

03:24.160 --> 03:25.596
Messy.

03:25.596 --> 03:27.598
<i>- But getting done.</i>
- Copy.

03:27.598 --> 03:30.906
Lily is too inexperienced to
do beds and heads by herself,

03:30.906 --> 03:33.082
so I have to go and check
her work,

03:33.082 --> 03:36.912
which means I can'’t go and
help Tumi and Kyle on service.

03:36.912 --> 03:38.870
Where'’s Lily and Jess?

03:38.870 --> 03:39.915
I don'’t know.

03:42.309 --> 03:43.571
Don'’t expose them.

03:43.571 --> 03:44.528
Oh, my God.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.488
I'’m just gonna hit the head.

04:00.065 --> 04:01.502
The schedule is being adapted.

04:01.502 --> 04:03.591
My sleeping schedule
is----ed right now.

04:03.591 --> 04:06.507
This is the only time
I could have a rest today.

04:06.507 --> 04:08.160
You guys got your breaks
when we were on

04:08.160 --> 04:10.032
the----ing diving excursions.

04:10.032 --> 04:11.294
You guys were chilling.

04:11.294 --> 04:13.296
There are four
stewardesses awake.

04:13.296 --> 04:15.690
Kick one up and
help you with service.

04:15.690 --> 04:17.561
It'’s just carrying
- ing plates up.

04:17.561 --> 04:19.694
Nothing I can----ing do.

04:19.694 --> 04:20.695
Yeah.

04:23.088 --> 04:24.307
Hi, my angel, bum-bums.

04:24.307 --> 04:25.439
Pork belly.

04:25.439 --> 04:27.832
I know.
This looks very fattening.

04:27.832 --> 04:29.225
- Yeah.
- I'’m just struggling, man.

04:29.225 --> 04:30.966
What happened?
What'’s wrong?

04:30.966 --> 04:34.709
It'’s like how chef feels about
me, how Lily feels about me.

04:34.709 --> 04:36.711
I feel like I'’m back
to Kyle at 21,

04:36.711 --> 04:39.496
as opposed to being
Kyle 31 years old.

04:39.496 --> 04:40.889
Jack, Jack, all crew,

04:40.889 --> 04:43.935
dessert will be like
five minutes.

04:43.935 --> 04:44.980
C'’est la vie.

04:47.243 --> 04:48.505
- We'’re done.
- Sweet.

04:48.505 --> 04:50.115
Can you bring this
down to laundry?

04:50.115 --> 04:51.291
I'’ll be right back.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.509
Let me double check
with Tumi.

04:52.509 --> 04:53.858
Now he'’s having his dessert.

04:53.858 --> 04:55.164
Thank you.

04:55.164 --> 04:58.080
For dessert, you have a
hot chocolate lava cake.

04:58.080 --> 05:00.430
- Wow.
- Oh, my God.

05:00.430 --> 05:01.605
That definitely is lava.

05:01.605 --> 05:03.128
Cabins are done.
Laundry'’s flipped.

05:03.128 --> 05:04.869
She'’s folding laundry now.

05:06.349 --> 05:08.308
- See you in the morning.
- Bye.

05:09.265 --> 05:10.266
- That was amazing again.
- Was it?

05:10.266 --> 05:12.747
Let the chef know.

05:12.747 --> 05:14.357
Isn'’t it like...

05:14.357 --> 05:16.359
Three-mi is better than Tumi
because there'’s more of you.

05:16.359 --> 05:18.492
Shut up, Amish,
you----ing asshole.

05:20.624 --> 05:22.147
Oh, God.

05:22.147 --> 05:26.500
This is a dentist that'’s
acting like an absolute twat.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.240
Like, how embarrassing.

05:28.240 --> 05:30.286
Mr. Fendi Fendi Gucci.

05:30.286 --> 05:31.766
How dare you butcher my name?

05:31.766 --> 05:34.159
I feel----ing
great right now.

05:34.159 --> 05:35.813
Okay, so tell me
about your schedule.

05:37.162 --> 05:39.034
Haleigh finishes at seven.
Coming up at three.

05:39.034 --> 05:41.515
Max finishes at 10 o'’clock.

05:41.515 --> 05:43.430
But I just put him down
early this evening

05:43.430 --> 05:44.909
because he didn'’t get
his two-hour break.

05:44.909 --> 05:46.607
And Lara was just having
a little break

05:46.607 --> 05:48.217
because she'’s got to
stay up till

05:48.217 --> 05:49.610
who knows how late tonight.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.263
So Max should have had
a break this morning.

05:51.263 --> 05:52.961
You always got a plan for that.

05:52.961 --> 05:54.832
Do you normally have three?

05:58.053 --> 05:59.010
The girls.

06:00.882 --> 06:01.839
Okay.

06:01.839 --> 06:03.406
So I'’m going to tell you this.

06:03.406 --> 06:05.452
You never put people, three
people down at the same time.

06:05.452 --> 06:06.801
- And you leave the boat.
- Yeah.

06:06.801 --> 06:08.542
- It'’s a safety issue.
- Yeah.

06:08.542 --> 06:11.371
But that'’s the thing we
have to have covered.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.721
This charter called
for earlier activities.

06:13.721 --> 06:15.505
So that'’s where Luka
has to learn

06:15.505 --> 06:17.072
to adjust his watch schedule.

06:17.072 --> 06:19.161
This is Luka'’s first
time being a bosun.

06:19.161 --> 06:21.424
But we'’re deep into
the charter season.

06:21.424 --> 06:23.121
My expectation is higher
of him right now.

06:23.121 --> 06:24.427
Same thing with Tumi.

06:24.427 --> 06:26.995
Tumi had two people doing
beds and heads

06:26.995 --> 06:29.432
when one of them could
be helping with service.

06:29.432 --> 06:30.738
I didn'’t know that.

06:30.738 --> 06:32.348
Yes, deck crew should
have been helping.

06:32.348 --> 06:34.655
But she should have called
for her interior crew first.

06:34.655 --> 06:36.613
Okay.
Well, I'’ll see you at...

06:36.613 --> 06:38.180
- 7:30.
- Yeah, 7:30.

06:38.180 --> 06:40.008
Good night.
We'’ll see you in the morning.

06:43.446 --> 06:45.883
Good night, Amish.

06:48.930 --> 06:50.975
Max!
I'’m not looking at your butt.

06:50.975 --> 06:53.369
Okay, I'’m double
fisting this.

06:53.369 --> 06:54.457
Good night.

06:54.457 --> 06:56.067
Kyle.

06:56.067 --> 06:57.373
God damn it.

06:57.373 --> 06:58.418
See you tomorrow, Kyle.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.462
I need a----ing drink.

06:59.462 --> 07:00.985
It'’s my bar.

07:06.730 --> 07:07.688
I have no idea what
the [bleep] is going on.

07:07.688 --> 07:09.254
I'’m----ed up right now.

07:09.254 --> 07:10.691
Are these the most
drunk guests you'’ve ever had?

07:10.691 --> 07:12.170
I don'’t know.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.999
Close.

07:22.267 --> 07:24.531
Kiss my ass.

07:24.531 --> 07:27.882
<i>Deck crew, table is
clear for a wipe down.</i>

07:27.882 --> 07:29.274
Jesus Christ.

07:29.274 --> 07:30.537
I don'’t want you to be alarmed,

07:30.537 --> 07:31.799
but your underwear is
on your foot.

07:33.061 --> 07:34.932
Sweet dreams.

07:38.936 --> 07:40.416
Okay, girl,
that'’s all the guests.

07:40.416 --> 07:42.462
Why does this feel
unnecessarily crazy?

07:42.462 --> 07:43.550
100%.

07:43.550 --> 07:44.594
What just happened?

07:44.594 --> 07:46.161
I don'’t know.

07:46.161 --> 07:48.337
This charter is definitely
being extremely stressful.

07:48.337 --> 07:50.557
The guests have been stressful,
but also at the same time,

07:50.557 --> 07:53.777
Lily'’s lack of experience is
becoming more of a liability.

07:53.777 --> 07:56.432
She'’s slowing Jess down and
is slowing everything down,

07:56.432 --> 07:58.347
which means that
I need the deck'’s help.

07:58.347 --> 08:01.002
I just need to figure out a
way to turn this all around.

08:01.002 --> 08:03.439
- I'’m going to go to bed.
- He'’s in a good space.

08:03.439 --> 08:06.137
He'’s got me, you know.

08:06.137 --> 08:07.748
Oh, you farted, bro.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.968
It wasn'’t me, bro.

08:10.968 --> 08:12.927
I promise.

08:31.772 --> 08:33.643
This is----ing awesome.

08:42.130 --> 08:43.827
Hello?

08:43.827 --> 08:44.959
Oh, sorry.

08:47.875 --> 08:49.180
More.

08:49.180 --> 08:50.704
Who was that?

08:51.922 --> 08:54.925
How you doing, man?
You doing good?

08:57.493 --> 08:59.234
You'’ve got to be kidding me.

08:59.234 --> 09:00.191
You guys okay?

09:02.716 --> 09:04.152
- You can go back down.
- Who'’s that?

09:04.152 --> 09:05.327
Where'’s the hot tub?

09:05.327 --> 09:06.546
This is pretty----ing serious.

09:06.546 --> 09:07.851
Like, I'’ve never
witnessed anything

09:07.851 --> 09:09.244
like this before in the past.

09:09.244 --> 09:11.812
To have a guest trying
to get into your cabin,

09:11.812 --> 09:13.727
it'’s----ing
not acceptable at all.

09:13.727 --> 09:15.206
Where'’s the hot tub?

09:17.339 --> 09:18.645
Coming up...

09:18.645 --> 09:19.994
Sandy wants to speak
to you in the bridge.

09:19.994 --> 09:21.212
Yeah, okay.

09:21.212 --> 09:22.431
It'’s not fun for me
to tell you this.

09:22.431 --> 09:23.606
He'’s a problem.

09:23.606 --> 09:25.477
You have to get
him under control.

09:25.477 --> 09:27.567
- Under control, got it.
- Or he'’s off the boat.

09:30.831 --> 09:32.441
Where'’s the hot tub?

09:32.441 --> 09:34.399
- How you doing, man?
- You all right?

09:34.399 --> 09:35.575
You guys okay?

09:38.186 --> 09:39.143
Where'’s the hot tub?

09:39.143 --> 09:40.623
What the [bleep]?

09:40.623 --> 09:41.972
- No, go to sleep.
- I'’ll get out of here.

09:41.972 --> 09:43.626
No, you guys go to sleep.
It'’s okay.

09:43.626 --> 09:45.976
- Yeah, it'’s okay.
- Thank you, man.

09:45.976 --> 09:47.499
It'’s fine.
Thank you.

09:47.499 --> 09:50.546
yeah.

09:50.546 --> 09:52.592
Who is that?

09:52.592 --> 09:54.506
Oh my God.

09:54.506 --> 09:57.684
How hard is it to get into a
hot tub in this----ing place?

10:02.123 --> 10:03.341
Yeah. Okay.

10:03.341 --> 10:04.560
Night.

10:10.697 --> 10:13.134
More ale and more hot tub.

10:13.134 --> 10:14.657
God damn it.

10:14.657 --> 10:17.965
Shut the [bleep] up.
- ing hot tub.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.285
What do you do until three?

10:34.285 --> 10:35.852
I would, like, the table.

10:35.852 --> 10:39.247
But I can see, like, why you
need someone like especially...

10:42.859 --> 10:44.165
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

10:44.165 --> 10:45.949
What happened?

10:45.949 --> 10:47.298
Okay, as long as you'’re okay.

10:47.298 --> 10:48.256
Did you fall?

10:49.518 --> 10:50.867
- Okay.
- It'’s okay.

10:50.867 --> 10:52.695
Okay, the glass is fine
as long as you'’re okay.

10:52.695 --> 10:55.829
- Jesus, bro.
- I dropped my glass.

10:55.829 --> 10:57.482
No worries.
Come this side.

10:57.482 --> 10:59.049
I'’ll help you.

10:59.049 --> 11:00.834
I don'’t know what
the hell has happened.

11:00.834 --> 11:02.400
The last I saw,
I put Amish to bed.

11:02.400 --> 11:03.575
I don'’t want you to be alarmed,

11:03.575 --> 11:05.142
but your underwear
is on your foot.

11:05.142 --> 11:07.057
I'’m not gonna sit there
and watch if he falls asleep.

11:07.057 --> 11:08.319
Hold on tight.

11:08.319 --> 11:10.757
you, pick up
little pieces like this.

11:10.757 --> 11:12.106
Here we are.

11:12.106 --> 11:13.498
Kyle, you'’ve been magnificent.

11:13.498 --> 11:14.674
Oh, thanks honey.

11:19.940 --> 11:20.854
Oh no!

11:23.378 --> 11:24.988
ing hell.

11:24.988 --> 11:26.729
- Sweet dreams.
- Thank you.

11:26.729 --> 11:28.600
You'’re welcome.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.777
<i>- Lara, Lara.
- Yeah?</i>

11:30.777 --> 11:31.995
Our guests is down, let'’s go.

11:31.995 --> 11:33.040
Crew mess.

11:39.655 --> 11:41.135
This was at 1 am.

11:41.135 --> 11:43.746
The guy staying
in the twin just

11:43.746 --> 11:45.574
opened up----ing cabin doors.

11:45.574 --> 11:47.054
And Luka went out and was like,

11:47.054 --> 11:49.273
people are trying to
sleep, bro. Please leave.

11:53.060 --> 11:55.018
I'’ll be back right now.
Don'’t leave me.

11:59.806 --> 12:01.329
It'’s me, captain.

12:02.504 --> 12:04.158
I just wanna give a report.

12:06.290 --> 12:09.206
But Amish went to
the girls'’ cabins,

12:09.206 --> 12:11.556
opened up the doors
while they were sleeping,

12:11.556 --> 12:12.862
and Luka told him go away.

12:12.862 --> 12:14.298
Oh my God.
Where are the guys?

12:14.298 --> 12:15.473
They'’re in bed now.

12:15.473 --> 12:16.692
Sorry for waking you.

12:16.692 --> 12:18.259
I don'’t want you
to find out today.

12:20.696 --> 12:23.133
Crew, they have
to have a safe place.

12:23.133 --> 12:24.961
If the guests think they can
just open their crew door,

12:24.961 --> 12:26.528
that'’s a violation.

12:26.528 --> 12:28.791
It'’s a door.
It'’s a barrier for a reason.

12:28.791 --> 12:30.445
And they need to get
this under control.

12:30.445 --> 12:31.925
Otherwise, I will
end the charter.

12:34.536 --> 12:36.277
I will do, Captain.

12:36.277 --> 12:38.105
You'’re welcome, Captain.
Sleep tight.

12:43.153 --> 12:44.328
She was thankful.

12:44.328 --> 12:45.590
- Really?
- Oof.

12:45.590 --> 12:47.201
I'’m going to bed now.

13:10.398 --> 13:11.965
Morning.

13:11.965 --> 13:14.097
If we'’re not doing anything
by 9, can I, like, go off?

13:14.097 --> 13:15.577
I'’m so tired, dude.

13:15.577 --> 13:16.839
We got to launch the tender.

13:16.839 --> 13:19.015
We need three of
us until Lara'’s back.

13:19.015 --> 13:20.190
You can wake her up at 9.

13:20.190 --> 13:22.018
I'’m just a "sweepy" girl.

13:22.018 --> 13:23.541
I feel bad, yeah.

13:23.541 --> 13:25.239
It'’s pretty sh--,
but this is the schedule

13:25.239 --> 13:27.589
which----ed up
everyone'’s break.

13:27.589 --> 13:29.939
Just got to keep the team
together and get through it.

13:29.939 --> 13:32.420
Me and the two girls
got to go for a----ing drink

13:32.420 --> 13:33.769
after this charter.

13:33.769 --> 13:35.162
But when we set up
a few other things,

13:35.162 --> 13:36.511
you'’re going to go down
for a couple hours.

13:36.511 --> 13:37.512
Yeah.

13:40.428 --> 13:43.997
Can you check the day heads,
flip the laundry,

13:43.997 --> 13:45.868
- and just start there.
- Yep.

13:45.868 --> 13:47.174
Are we launching everything?

13:47.174 --> 13:48.349
Yeah.

13:48.349 --> 13:49.916
Good morning.

13:49.916 --> 13:50.917
You can swing it the other way.

13:50.917 --> 13:51.918
What, nose to you?

13:51.918 --> 13:53.093
Yeah, it should come around.

13:55.617 --> 13:56.792
Bubble and squeak.

13:58.925 --> 14:00.535
What'’s a bubble and squash?

14:00.535 --> 14:02.406
- Squeak.
- Bubble, squeak.

14:02.406 --> 14:03.973
Bubble and squeak.

14:03.973 --> 14:06.367
That sounds like a kid'’s show.

14:06.367 --> 14:07.803
Bubble and squeak.

14:07.803 --> 14:10.632
It'’s an Irish breakfast
with, like, a potato cake

14:10.632 --> 14:11.633
with fried eggs and bacon.

14:11.633 --> 14:13.417
Bubble and squeak.

14:13.417 --> 14:14.941
Classic.

14:14.941 --> 14:16.333
You grab her and then
I'’ll see you in two hours.

14:16.333 --> 14:17.378
Okay.

14:21.469 --> 14:24.559
Lara, Luka wants you
on deck at nine.

14:24.559 --> 14:26.778
- So Lara is coming now?
- Yeah.

14:26.778 --> 14:28.041
What time is it?

14:28.041 --> 14:29.477
Nine.
You'’re going to grab that side?

14:33.133 --> 14:34.743
- Who'’s this?
- Yeah.

14:34.743 --> 14:37.789
When it comes out the washer,
I try first give it a shake.

14:37.789 --> 14:39.966
- Yeah.
- And then just toss it in.

14:53.936 --> 14:55.807
- So that'’s me and Jack.
- Yeah.

14:55.807 --> 14:57.418
Jack'’s been singling
himself away

14:57.418 --> 14:59.289
because of Natalya
that was here.

14:59.289 --> 15:00.900
Yeah.
So I obviously don'’t know.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.640
And it'’s not Jack.
Give me a fair chance to...

15:02.640 --> 15:04.294
Yeah.

15:04.294 --> 15:05.513
So I genuinely don'’t have
a----ing clue what happened.

15:05.513 --> 15:07.080
- Yeah.
- Before I went on this boat.

15:07.080 --> 15:08.298
I don'’t see
what I should have known.

15:08.298 --> 15:09.778
That'’s very mature on your side.

15:09.778 --> 15:10.779
- Yeah.
- And I really appreciate it.

15:10.779 --> 15:13.564
And I just want to say it.

15:13.564 --> 15:15.305
Thank you. And I think
you chose the right time.

15:15.305 --> 15:16.132
Thanks, Lily.

15:16.132 --> 15:17.481
No bad vibes, honey.

15:17.481 --> 15:18.787
No, no, no.

15:18.787 --> 15:19.788
All gone and dusted,
I promise you.

15:19.788 --> 15:21.007
Yeah, perfect.

15:21.007 --> 15:22.660
Leave it to the girl
who didn'’t know

15:22.660 --> 15:24.924
where the on-button was for
the dryer to apologize to me.

15:24.924 --> 15:29.058
That being said, I still feel
a lot of lingering tension.

15:29.058 --> 15:31.147
And on top of
my list now is Jack.

15:31.147 --> 15:32.888
There'’s still something
I need a sort out.

15:32.888 --> 15:36.326
But I'’m just too exhausted right
now to even think about it.

15:36.326 --> 15:37.980
Leave these until that is ready.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.286
I'’ll let you know
when it'’s ready.

15:39.286 --> 15:40.156
Thanks, hon.

15:40.156 --> 15:41.984
- Morning.
- How are you?

15:41.984 --> 15:43.072
How are you?

15:43.072 --> 15:44.508
- Would you like coffee?
- Yes.

15:44.508 --> 15:45.553
Strong black coffee.

15:45.553 --> 15:47.207
Of course.

15:48.425 --> 15:49.992
Good morning.

15:49.992 --> 15:50.993
Perfect.
Thank you.

15:50.993 --> 15:52.864
I'’m here now.

15:52.864 --> 15:54.301
- Morning.
- Morning.

15:54.301 --> 15:57.130
Um, Amish,
next time come get me.

15:57.130 --> 15:59.219
- Hi-ya.
- He was smashed.

15:59.219 --> 16:00.655
He knocked on everyone'’s cabin.

16:00.655 --> 16:01.743
Came into the crew cabin.

16:01.743 --> 16:02.787
After midnight.

16:02.787 --> 16:04.180
And then once he got to mine,

16:04.180 --> 16:05.225
I opened the door
and I was like, get out of here.

16:05.225 --> 16:07.662
I was like about to go crazy.

16:07.662 --> 16:09.707
Who is that?
Guest? Oh, okay.

16:11.318 --> 16:12.754
There he is.

16:12.754 --> 16:14.843
I just looked at the
clock and I'’m like, get up.

16:14.843 --> 16:16.627
- Good morning, Kyle.
- Morning.

16:19.587 --> 16:21.937
Well, what happened now?

16:24.592 --> 16:28.248
I'’m trying to find what
Lily'’s actually good at.

16:28.248 --> 16:31.381
I have patience, but everyone
is extremely exhausted.

16:31.381 --> 16:32.730
Like, we have to
try something new.

16:32.730 --> 16:34.036
<i>Lily, Lily, Lily.</i>

16:34.036 --> 16:35.777
Could you meet me in
the pantry, please?

16:35.777 --> 16:38.388
<i>Coming.</i>

16:38.388 --> 16:39.650
Oh, [bleep].

16:39.650 --> 16:41.087
Oh, dear.

16:41.087 --> 16:43.654
Slow and steady, Max.

16:43.654 --> 16:45.961
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:47.093 --> 16:48.616
...as well as the twins.

16:48.616 --> 16:50.226
So I'’m going to get Jess
to help me up here.

16:50.226 --> 16:51.923
But we'’ll come pick up on you.

16:51.923 --> 16:53.577
- Okay, cool.
- Thank you.

16:53.577 --> 16:55.666
Tumi, Tumi,
when the primary wakes up...

16:59.279 --> 17:00.367
Copy.
He'’s awake now.

17:00.367 --> 17:01.716
I'’m going to send him there.

17:01.716 --> 17:03.196
Okay.
I'’m heading to the bridge.

17:03.196 --> 17:04.936
Sandy wants to speak
to you on the bridge.

17:04.936 --> 17:07.591
Okay.

17:07.591 --> 17:10.159
You know, as a captain, it'’s
my job to keep the crew safe.

17:10.159 --> 17:11.421
It'’s my job to keep
everyone safe.

17:11.421 --> 17:13.641
- Hi, good morning.
- Morning.

17:13.641 --> 17:15.251
But my crew are my priority.

17:15.251 --> 17:20.256
Um, so last night, Amish
went into the crew area,

17:20.256 --> 17:22.432
opened all the crew doors.

17:22.432 --> 17:24.652
It'’s not fun for me
to tell you this.

17:24.652 --> 17:26.610
He'’s awake.

17:29.570 --> 17:31.137
He'’s a problem.

17:31.137 --> 17:33.791
You have to get him under
control or he'’s off the boat.

17:40.494 --> 17:42.974
It'’s not fun for me
to tell you this.

17:42.974 --> 17:47.370
Last night, Amish

17:47.370 --> 17:49.024
went into the crew area,

17:49.024 --> 17:53.072
opened all the crew doors, and
the crew area is off limits.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.030
It'’s a safety thing for us.

17:55.030 --> 17:56.597
You have to get
him under control.

17:56.597 --> 17:58.120
- Under control, got it.
- Or he'’s off the boat.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.382
Understood.

17:59.382 --> 18:01.167
I don'’t want any of that.

18:02.603 --> 18:03.734
Magnificent.

18:03.734 --> 18:04.822
I'’m on it. Thank you.

18:04.822 --> 18:05.823
Thank you.

18:09.914 --> 18:11.351
Oh.

18:11.351 --> 18:13.353
Natalya texts me
from time to time.

18:13.353 --> 18:15.006
Obviously, we had a bit
of a connection,

18:15.006 --> 18:18.445
but that couldn'’t go anywhere,
because obviously,

18:18.445 --> 18:20.099
she was in a relationship,

18:20.099 --> 18:23.580
and there was a lot of other
things she had to sort out.

18:32.198 --> 18:33.329
She just looks lost.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.333
- Amish, let'’s go upstairs, man.
- Sure.

18:37.333 --> 18:40.554
So I just had
a talk with Captain Sandy,

18:40.554 --> 18:42.599
and she said you got a little
out of control last night.

18:42.599 --> 18:43.774
Okay.

18:43.774 --> 18:45.776
So one of the things
that she mentioned

18:45.776 --> 18:47.561
was you can'’t go
through the crew mess,

18:47.561 --> 18:49.606
or you opened all the doors.

18:49.606 --> 18:50.825
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, you can'’t do that.

18:50.825 --> 18:52.131
Okay.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.132
These are people'’s
private spaces.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.307
Right.

18:54.307 --> 18:55.656
We have to be
respectful to that.

18:55.656 --> 18:57.136
They thought,
you'’re on that verge.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.137
If he gets any
more out of control,

18:58.137 --> 18:59.790
we got to boot him off the boat.

18:59.790 --> 19:00.965
Oh, all right.

19:00.965 --> 19:02.663
So let'’s just
calm it down, all right?

19:02.663 --> 19:03.968
I know that, yeah.

19:03.968 --> 19:05.448
Appreciate it.
Thank you.

19:10.714 --> 19:12.455
Hi, baby.

19:12.455 --> 19:14.240
Um...

19:16.720 --> 19:19.810
There'’s a lot of
negativity on board.

19:19.810 --> 19:20.768
And I'’m back at it.

19:25.555 --> 19:27.818
I'’m a difficult----ing package.

19:33.215 --> 19:34.521
I'’m sorry.

19:34.521 --> 19:37.480
I----ing miss
this person so much.

19:38.873 --> 19:44.008
I'’ve just lost so much of
me through all of this.

19:44.008 --> 19:45.836
I'’m tired of fighting,

19:45.836 --> 19:49.971
wasting so much energy being
negative and hostile and sad.

19:49.971 --> 19:54.323
But how do I change people'’s
ideas and thoughts about me

19:54.323 --> 19:56.195
if they already feel that way?

19:57.370 --> 19:59.546
I'’m really,
really missing you.

20:05.421 --> 20:06.640
<i>Luka, Luka to the bridge.</i>

20:06.640 --> 20:08.032
<i>Copy, Sandy.</i>

20:08.032 --> 20:10.209
Today we have something
called Bubble and Squeak.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.036
- Squeak?
- Yes, Squeak.

20:12.036 --> 20:14.561
Ooh, yeah.

20:14.561 --> 20:15.605
It'’s not that cute.

20:15.605 --> 20:17.216
It'’s an Irish breakfast,

20:17.216 --> 20:21.307
which is basically potatoes
and cabbage with eggs and bacon.

20:21.307 --> 20:22.743
The swells are getting worse.

20:22.743 --> 20:24.919
I can'’t dock in anything
over 18 knots of wind.

20:24.919 --> 20:26.747
So we'’re going
to haul anchor and head in.

20:26.747 --> 20:28.139
Okay, cool.

20:28.139 --> 20:29.619
We'’ll lift everything now
and get ready to go.

20:29.619 --> 20:31.230
I'’m going to talk
to the primary.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.622
- Sweet.
- Thank you.

20:32.622 --> 20:34.407
Cheffy,
we want all the specials.

20:34.407 --> 20:36.147
Five specials, yeah.

20:36.147 --> 20:38.759
Bubble and Squeak, I'’m telling
you, no one can resist it.

20:38.759 --> 20:40.369
Deck crew pack up all
the water toys?

20:40.369 --> 20:42.328
<i>- On my way.
- Copy.</i>

20:45.592 --> 20:47.246
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.247
Well, I have some
not great news.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.900
Okay.

20:49.900 --> 20:51.815
We'’re going to head back to the
dock because of the weather.

20:51.815 --> 20:53.426
- Well?
- I'’m so sorry.

20:53.426 --> 20:54.427
So there'’s like a lot
of waves out at sea?

20:54.427 --> 20:55.950
- Yeah.
- Okay.

20:55.950 --> 20:57.560
- We trust you.
- I'’m going to go back to work.

20:57.560 --> 20:58.561
- Enjoy your breakfast.
- Thank you, thank you.

20:58.561 --> 21:00.389
You'’re like a monkey.

21:00.389 --> 21:03.349
What is going on here?

21:03.349 --> 21:05.089
We'’re going back to Genoa port?

21:05.089 --> 21:06.874
Yeah.

21:06.874 --> 21:07.875
<i>Coming up.</i>

21:07.875 --> 21:09.398
Tumi, I'’m bringing
up plates.

21:09.398 --> 21:10.834
<i>Copy, thank you.</i>

21:15.361 --> 21:16.753
Can you come back with a boner?

21:16.753 --> 21:18.451
Yes!

21:27.547 --> 21:29.636
There'’s absolutely no point
confronting Kyle.

21:29.636 --> 21:32.378
He'’s the type of person,
he thrives on that for one.

21:32.378 --> 21:34.467
I'’m very good at
holding my tongue.

21:34.467 --> 21:35.990
Bubble and squeak.

21:35.990 --> 21:38.427
But the minute I release
my tongue, it'’s game over

21:38.427 --> 21:40.211
because I'’ll probably
get fired off the boat.

21:40.211 --> 21:42.736
My plan is just to avoid it
and just carry on with the job.

21:42.736 --> 21:44.607
- Thanks, chef.
- No worries.

21:48.350 --> 21:50.352
- Enjoy everyone.
- Thank you.

21:50.352 --> 21:51.875
Presentation is fantastic.

21:51.875 --> 21:53.094
Really pretty.

21:53.094 --> 21:54.965
I'’m going to check on Lily.

21:54.965 --> 21:56.140
Oh, yeah, Lily.

21:56.140 --> 21:57.794
The potato cake is so good.

21:57.794 --> 21:59.100
- Really good.
- All good?

21:59.100 --> 22:01.320
Hello. How'’s it going?

22:05.411 --> 22:06.673
Which one? This one?

22:06.673 --> 22:09.415
I think this corner
actually goes this way.

22:09.415 --> 22:10.503
How did you do that?

22:10.503 --> 22:12.809
So you lift it.

22:12.809 --> 22:15.072
The tighter the better,
and then you take in this one.

22:23.385 --> 22:24.908
Pretty much.

22:24.908 --> 22:27.694
Thank you.
I'’m going to check on you later.

22:27.694 --> 22:29.348
I'’m going to go get my shorts,
I'’ll be right back.

22:31.480 --> 22:33.743
All right.

22:33.743 --> 22:34.657
Nice.

22:34.657 --> 22:37.094
Oh, the person I am looking for.

22:37.094 --> 22:40.576
So I have the opera singer
coming at home seven.

22:40.576 --> 22:42.839
Primary request to have
an opera singer come aboard.

22:42.839 --> 22:46.452
I need an opera singer
to sing Happy Birthday.

22:46.452 --> 22:47.409
<i>Perfect.</i>

22:47.409 --> 22:48.932
And then go into dinner.

22:48.932 --> 22:50.194
- Okay, I'’m good with that.
- If that'’s okay.

22:50.194 --> 22:51.195
100%.

22:51.195 --> 22:52.675
Everything'’s in.

22:52.675 --> 22:53.894
We'’re just going to start
pumping up the fenders.

22:53.894 --> 22:55.069
Awesome sauce.

22:55.069 --> 22:56.984
<i>You can start
hauling the anchor.</i>

22:56.984 --> 22:58.855
<i>Okay, medium stay.</i>

22:58.855 --> 22:59.813
12.

23:01.728 --> 23:02.816
12 o'’clock.

23:04.731 --> 23:06.559
And how'’s the bathroom?

23:09.126 --> 23:10.911
Okay, yeah.

23:10.911 --> 23:12.391
Anchor home.

23:12.391 --> 23:13.870
Yi yi yi yi yi yi!

23:17.178 --> 23:18.658
All right, wings are open.

23:18.658 --> 23:19.746
Fenders are pumped up.

23:19.746 --> 23:21.269
We'’re going to set up our lines.

23:21.269 --> 23:22.575
Cool.

23:33.629 --> 23:35.283
Oh, for [bleep]'’s sakes.

23:35.283 --> 23:36.719
<i>Lily, Lily, Tumi.</i>

23:36.719 --> 23:38.721
Could you come to the
twin cabin, please?

23:40.027 --> 23:42.116
- Clear and diet.
- If I looked like you,

23:42.116 --> 23:44.684
I would be sitting there with
my underwear on, too.

23:50.385 --> 23:52.169
Oh, I thought you meant
that one.

23:53.301 --> 23:54.563
Oh, sh--.

23:54.563 --> 23:56.260
I have to teach her.

23:56.260 --> 23:58.132
That'’s my responsibility,
and I'’m happy to do that.

23:58.132 --> 24:02.441
But at the same time, I feel
like she'’s not getting it.

24:02.441 --> 24:05.226
Get that done before you
go on your break.

24:05.226 --> 24:06.575
This is her second charter.

24:06.575 --> 24:08.403
If you'’re not processing
what I'’m saying,

24:08.403 --> 24:09.796
this is not going to work.

24:28.292 --> 24:31.078
So the next two charters, I'’m
going to remake the schedule.

24:31.078 --> 24:33.384
We'’ll basically
be working till 3.

24:33.384 --> 24:36.910
And if the guest is still awake
at 3 o'’clock, you go to bed.

24:36.910 --> 24:38.520
Today is this guy'’s birthday.

24:38.520 --> 24:40.261
Then tonight'’s
his birthday bash.

24:41.915 --> 24:42.742
Yeah.

24:42.742 --> 24:43.960
Am I here with you?

24:43.960 --> 24:46.223
- We know the drill.
- Easy peasy.

24:46.223 --> 24:47.703
And we'’re here again.

24:47.703 --> 24:49.400
We'’ve got two pilots on board.

24:49.400 --> 24:51.968
<i>Luka, we'’re going into our
original berth.</i>

24:51.968 --> 24:53.970
You'’re going to need
crew on both sides.

24:53.970 --> 24:56.233
I want my normal side,
that side.

24:56.233 --> 24:57.800
Hi, welcome.

24:57.800 --> 25:00.063
Luka, we can put
all the fenders out.

25:00.063 --> 25:01.848
- You guys got this?
- We got this.

25:01.848 --> 25:03.197
- All right.
- Don'’t [bleep] it up.

25:03.197 --> 25:05.852
Looks like we'’re going
to get quite close.

25:05.852 --> 25:07.288
<i>20 meters to the dock.</i>

25:07.288 --> 25:09.072
Starboard side.

25:09.072 --> 25:11.945
<i>55 meters to the ground line.
Starboard Venture.</i>

25:11.945 --> 25:14.121
<i>8 meters, Four Quarter.</i>

25:14.121 --> 25:15.905
I'’ve had a really
- ing tough charter.

25:15.905 --> 25:18.168
One thing I'’m proud of is
we'’re just so good

25:18.168 --> 25:19.474
at docking the boat.

25:19.474 --> 25:21.650
I'’m right on top of
this blue hulled vessel.

25:21.650 --> 25:24.131
We have this small
floating dock still here

25:24.131 --> 25:25.872
that we'’ll squeeze
in-between us.

25:25.872 --> 25:28.048
We'’re getting awfully close
to that other boat.

25:28.048 --> 25:30.050
You have 10 meters to the dock.

25:30.050 --> 25:32.400
We'’re pretty much touching
these boats.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.706
There'’s like no room for error.

25:33.706 --> 25:35.446
She'’s cherry on the side.

25:35.446 --> 25:37.318
Hi.

25:37.318 --> 25:38.580
That'’s plenty.

25:38.580 --> 25:39.842
We'’re looking good.
You can go.

25:39.842 --> 25:41.409
Perfect.
We'’re sitting nicely here.

25:41.409 --> 25:42.889
- She'’s good.
<i>- We'’re looking good back here.</i>

25:42.889 --> 25:44.412
<i>Got all four lines on.</i>

25:44.412 --> 25:46.066
Nice work.
Thank you.

25:46.066 --> 25:47.458
Sweet.

25:47.458 --> 25:48.764
- Oh, ciao.
- Grazie mille.

25:48.764 --> 25:49.809
- Thank you.
- That'’s it.

25:49.809 --> 25:51.027
Put a fork in it.

25:51.027 --> 25:52.115
Hey.

25:52.115 --> 25:53.464
You need to blow up
these balloons.

25:53.464 --> 25:55.205
You can go to the laundry room
to do that.

25:55.205 --> 25:56.729
Lily needs a win.

25:56.729 --> 25:59.122
I don'’t think you can
up blowing up balloons.

25:59.122 --> 26:00.254
Be back.

26:00.254 --> 26:01.255
Nice job.

26:01.255 --> 26:02.430
That was smooth.

26:02.430 --> 26:03.692
That just gets smoother
and smoother.

26:03.692 --> 26:05.215
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:05.215 --> 26:06.608
I need to blow up
all these balloons.

26:06.608 --> 26:08.175
Let'’s go change, baby.

26:14.660 --> 26:16.618
There she is.

26:16.618 --> 26:17.750
Grilled lobsters.

26:17.750 --> 26:19.621
Wagyu T-bone steak.

26:19.621 --> 26:21.449
Side orders, truffle,
mac and cheese.

26:21.449 --> 26:23.103
Tomato and onion salad.

26:23.103 --> 26:25.671
I'’ve not got much experience
cooking for dentists.

26:25.671 --> 26:28.369
I am looking to get what we
call in Liverpool Turkey teeth.

26:28.369 --> 26:30.284
It'’s where you go to Turkey
and get your teeth done.

26:30.284 --> 26:31.938
So hopefully, if I do
them with good meal,

26:31.938 --> 26:34.114
they'’ll give me
a set of Turkey teeth.

26:34.114 --> 26:35.463
So I'’ll be dazzling.

26:35.463 --> 26:36.551
Dessert'’s cake.

26:36.551 --> 26:38.205
Yeah.
Surprise birthday cake.

26:38.205 --> 26:40.642
Could you help Jack
with dishes? He'’s got loads.

26:40.642 --> 26:42.992
We'’re going to help interior
in the shift tonight.

26:42.992 --> 26:44.690
Yes, I'’m going----ing
to the dishes.

26:44.690 --> 26:47.127
- Yeah, baby.
- Woo-hoo!

26:47.127 --> 26:48.781
- Right here?
- Perfect.

26:48.781 --> 26:49.956
- Perfect.
- Thank you.

26:49.956 --> 26:51.566
All right.
I have fish forks here.

26:51.566 --> 26:54.047
Amazing.
Can we put them on table?

26:54.047 --> 26:55.048
Yes.

27:00.053 --> 27:02.316
- Oh, wow.
- I know.

27:02.316 --> 27:04.013
My daughter'’s picked
all the outfits.

27:04.013 --> 27:05.188
- Dang.
- How are you?

27:05.188 --> 27:07.190
Nice to meet you.
I'’m Tumi.

27:07.190 --> 27:09.584
We'’ll take you to
the crew cabin.

27:09.584 --> 27:11.542
You can change in my room.

27:11.542 --> 27:12.631
What do you think, Mike?

27:12.631 --> 27:14.284
Oh.

27:14.284 --> 27:16.460
And so are you in that dress,
by the way.

27:16.460 --> 27:18.332
- See you later.
- Yes.

27:18.332 --> 27:20.160
Tumi, I thought I was
going to be the singer.

27:20.160 --> 27:21.596
Now you'’ve got someone else.

27:21.596 --> 27:24.338
- Sorry, Lara.
- You don'’t look very sorry.

27:24.338 --> 27:26.035
What time do you think
for dinner?

27:26.035 --> 27:27.994
8:30, quarter to nine.

27:27.994 --> 27:30.692
- Ten o'’clock.
- Ten o'’clock.

27:30.692 --> 27:31.998
Is she fit?

27:37.438 --> 27:38.569
Yeah.

27:38.569 --> 27:39.832
I don'’t know why
they didn'’t get you.

27:39.832 --> 27:42.878
♪ Happy birthday

27:42.878 --> 27:45.054
Kyle, come back.

27:47.317 --> 27:48.667
No, not at all.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.451
It'’s just natural talent.

27:53.802 --> 27:55.412
I'’m going to do
an announcement to my team

27:55.412 --> 27:56.413
and I'’ll bring them in.

27:56.413 --> 27:57.414
You'’re bringing them in?

28:00.069 --> 28:02.245
It'’s a violin.

28:02.245 --> 28:03.769
We'’re not in Ireland, bro.

28:05.727 --> 28:07.555
Oh, my God.
I love it.

28:07.555 --> 28:09.949
- They'’re going to love you.
- All right.

28:09.949 --> 28:11.428
I'’ve arranged a little
special gift

28:11.428 --> 28:13.126
and hoping something
that we all can remember

28:13.126 --> 28:14.301
for the rest of our life.

28:14.301 --> 28:15.606
- Thank you, Mike.
- Thank you.

28:15.606 --> 28:16.651
Cheers.

28:16.651 --> 28:18.522
Hi.
Nice to meet you.

28:18.522 --> 28:21.134
Do you want to hear something?

28:56.212 --> 28:58.258
This entire charter season,

28:58.258 --> 29:00.173
heaviness on me the entire time,

29:00.173 --> 29:01.652
all I'’m thinking is,

29:01.652 --> 29:03.132
how do you expel it, you know?

29:03.132 --> 29:06.222
And you'’ve got to think of
a healthy way to do it.

29:14.883 --> 29:18.147
Bravo! Bravo!

29:18.147 --> 29:20.541
Bravo!

29:20.541 --> 29:21.847
Thank you.

29:21.847 --> 29:23.326
You made it very special
for the both of us.

29:23.326 --> 29:24.501
How are you doing with time?

29:24.501 --> 29:26.329
I'’ll be ready...

29:26.329 --> 29:27.722
Copy.

29:27.722 --> 29:29.985
Okay, babe.
I'’m trying my new technique.

29:29.985 --> 29:31.465
What on earth is that?

29:31.465 --> 29:33.075
I'’m literally splitting
up each task

29:33.075 --> 29:34.816
so you get good
at doing each one,

29:34.816 --> 29:36.470
speeds up the work.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.182
Lily, did you finish this one?

29:53.182 --> 29:54.618
No, I'’m doing
division of labor.

29:54.618 --> 29:56.925
Oh, my God.
Let'’s just finish one.

29:56.925 --> 29:58.318
Trust me.
This will work better.

29:58.318 --> 30:00.450
Okay.

30:00.450 --> 30:01.669
Bye.

30:01.669 --> 30:03.018
I'’m just going to
take you guys down.

30:03.018 --> 30:04.019
That was outstanding.

30:04.019 --> 30:05.238
Oh, that'’s beautiful.

30:05.238 --> 30:06.935
- Come on in.
- Thank you so much.

30:06.935 --> 30:08.545
- Thank you.
- I appreciate it.

30:08.545 --> 30:09.808
It was nice to meet you.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.548
- Still or sparkling?
- Still, please.

30:11.548 --> 30:13.855
All right.
Start taking this up.

30:13.855 --> 30:14.987
Be careful.

30:14.987 --> 30:16.423
Take that as well.

30:18.817 --> 30:19.861
Coming up.

30:19.861 --> 30:21.210
We got your lobster.

30:21.210 --> 30:22.124
Oh, wow.

30:22.124 --> 30:23.386
I know you want some.

30:23.386 --> 30:25.867
I'’m taking this chef
home in my bag.

30:25.867 --> 30:27.173
All I'’m hearing is wow's, bro.

30:27.173 --> 30:31.177
- Wow.
- Wow.

30:31.177 --> 30:33.048
Wagyu mother----ing T-bone.

30:33.048 --> 30:34.745
The cream.
The butter.

30:34.745 --> 30:35.877
Yeah, that can go.

30:35.877 --> 30:38.053
- Amazing.
- That'’s the steak.

30:38.053 --> 30:40.186
- Mm-hmm.
- Great.

30:40.186 --> 30:42.753
Perfect. Thank you, Lara.

30:42.753 --> 30:44.059
Better finish the cakes now.

30:44.059 --> 30:46.583
No----ing way.

30:46.583 --> 30:48.063
Are you not entertained?

30:48.063 --> 30:49.064
Yeah, but you'’re amazing now.

30:49.064 --> 30:50.326
I would have drawn a dick.

30:50.326 --> 30:51.545
- A big penis.
- Hard not to do a dick.

30:51.545 --> 30:53.242
Make sure he eats a lot.

30:53.242 --> 30:54.635
He won'’t keep you up tonight.

30:58.291 --> 31:00.293
Okay.
I'’m going to cabins.

31:00.293 --> 31:01.729
All right, T.
Thank you, honey.

31:01.729 --> 31:02.948
You'’re welcome.

31:02.948 --> 31:03.949
I really appreciate you.

31:03.949 --> 31:05.951
That looks insane.

31:05.951 --> 31:08.954
Lily. Girl.

31:08.954 --> 31:10.999
This cannot look like this.

31:10.999 --> 31:12.000
I'’m literally putting them in.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.480
But it looks so bad.

31:13.480 --> 31:15.612
Just counted the towels out
to put them in the room.

31:15.612 --> 31:17.876
Let'’s not put them
on the ground, though.

31:17.876 --> 31:20.182
I don'’t know what's
going on right now.

31:20.182 --> 31:22.010
There'’s towels
all over the floor.

31:22.010 --> 31:24.447
She'’s got her fat iPad out.

31:24.447 --> 31:27.929
She'’s probably making TikToks
for all I know back here.

31:27.929 --> 31:29.191
If Tumi came down here,

31:29.191 --> 31:30.714
I'’m telling you
she would be pissed.

31:33.717 --> 31:35.632
- What? What happened?
- I'’m just like...

31:37.243 --> 31:39.941
There'’s like towels
all over the floor.

31:39.941 --> 31:41.203
And her iPad, just like...

31:41.203 --> 31:43.292
What'’s with the fricking iPad?

31:43.292 --> 31:45.120
- She'’s got her iPad?
- Yes, doing turndowns.

31:45.120 --> 31:46.469
I'’m just like, what
are you doing, girl?

31:46.469 --> 31:48.732
I'’d rather just do
it all by myself.

31:53.215 --> 31:56.218
The lobster was like
the best lobster I'’ve ever had.

31:56.218 --> 31:58.481
- Hi. Are you okay?
- Yes, doing the room.

31:58.481 --> 32:02.224
Why is there iPads?
I'’m hearing there's iPads.

32:02.224 --> 32:03.530
Why is she saying that?
Look at this.

32:03.530 --> 32:05.314
All I was doing
was counting the towels,

32:05.314 --> 32:06.968
and I kept going back.

32:06.968 --> 32:09.710
I would rather you even write
that down than use the iPad.

32:12.365 --> 32:14.541
My patience has just gone.

32:14.541 --> 32:17.152
iPads and even cell phones
are extremely distracting.

32:17.152 --> 32:20.677
This is like
my last straw with Lily.

32:22.288 --> 32:23.811
Lily, I'’m not going to have
this discussion.

32:23.811 --> 32:25.465
I'’m just telling you that
that causes problems.

32:25.465 --> 32:27.510
- Yeah.
- I'’m just warning you.

32:27.510 --> 32:29.730
That'’s fine.

32:38.695 --> 32:40.262
Can I clear for you?

32:40.262 --> 32:41.785
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that looks legit.

32:41.785 --> 32:44.005
White chocolate and dark
chocolate and strawberry.

32:44.005 --> 32:45.746
That looks so good.

32:56.235 --> 32:57.453
It'’s not my place.

32:57.453 --> 32:59.455
You'’re kidding?
Like, come on.

33:01.022 --> 33:03.111
Yeah, thanks, Jess,
for digging me in that one.

33:03.111 --> 33:04.678
Great of you.

33:08.377 --> 33:10.292
Table is cleared.
Table is cleared.

33:10.292 --> 33:11.685
<i>All crew. All crew.</i>

33:11.685 --> 33:13.121
<i>We'’re going to sing
Happy Birthday.</i>

33:13.121 --> 33:14.470
If I drop this now?

33:15.515 --> 33:17.908
I'’m not going.

33:17.908 --> 33:21.608
♪ Happy Birthday to you

33:21.608 --> 33:28.006
♪ Happy Birthday,
dear Mike and Cliff ♪

33:32.271 --> 33:33.968
That was awesome.

33:33.968 --> 33:35.230
- Aw.
- Wow.

33:35.230 --> 33:36.275
Wow.

33:36.275 --> 33:37.276
Impressive.

33:37.276 --> 33:38.668
Phew!

33:38.668 --> 33:40.018
- I'’m good.
- Yeah, this was delicious.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.410
We do the dishes.

33:41.410 --> 33:43.717
If you make this beautiful?
You can go to bed.

33:43.717 --> 33:46.067
- Mazel tov.
- Mazel tov.

33:46.067 --> 33:49.462
Jackie Paxi.
No!

33:49.462 --> 33:51.507
He just tells me cleans this
and you can go to bed

33:51.507 --> 33:54.380
and you'’re coming with
your----ing tower Eiffel.

33:54.380 --> 33:55.990
Thank you, mate.

33:55.990 --> 33:57.774
I have a feeling they'’re
going to sleep early tonight.

33:57.774 --> 33:59.820
All right, have a good night, guys.

34:01.909 --> 34:03.215
You did so well.

34:03.215 --> 34:04.694
Thanks.
Good night, guys.

34:04.694 --> 34:05.695
All dishes done.

34:05.695 --> 34:06.479
Hello.

34:06.479 --> 34:07.480
What are you doing?

34:07.480 --> 34:08.742
- Going to bed.
- Me too.

34:08.742 --> 34:10.613
- Good job, bro.
- Good night.

34:36.248 --> 34:37.553
Good morning.

34:37.553 --> 34:38.989
Drop off today, Tumi.

34:40.252 --> 34:41.775
Sandy, I want to say thank you.

34:41.775 --> 34:43.472
You'’ve been
frickin'’ magnificent.

34:43.472 --> 34:44.691
Oh, thank you.

34:44.691 --> 34:45.909
I appreciate it.

34:45.909 --> 34:47.389
I'’ll probably
become an idiot again.

34:47.389 --> 34:48.434
- No.
- I just want to say, you know.

34:48.434 --> 34:49.478
Don'’t, be a good boy.

34:49.478 --> 34:51.393
Oh, I'’m sad to be leaving.

34:51.393 --> 34:52.916
<i>All crew, all crew,
in your whites,</i>

34:52.916 --> 34:55.658
let'’s meet on the dock
for guest departure.

34:57.182 --> 35:00.185
How you doing?

35:00.185 --> 35:01.664
You made it such
a good trip.

35:01.664 --> 35:03.231
You made it such a good trip.

35:03.231 --> 35:04.276
Thank you.

35:04.276 --> 35:06.365
This was a once in a lifetime.

35:06.365 --> 35:08.280
And I hope from
the bottom of my heart,

35:08.280 --> 35:09.585
this gives a smile to your face.

35:09.585 --> 35:11.283
- Thanks again.
- Thank you very much.

35:11.283 --> 35:12.414
- Appreciate it.
- Bye, guys.

35:12.414 --> 35:13.850
Thank you so much.

35:13.850 --> 35:14.895
All right, everyone.

35:14.895 --> 35:16.375
Out of your whites
into your reds.

35:16.375 --> 35:18.420
- Thanks, Captain.
- That was lovely.

35:23.469 --> 35:25.340
That envelope looked
really small.

35:27.690 --> 35:31.694
I'’m going to make you look
a bit more prettier later.

35:31.694 --> 35:34.523
All crew, all crew, let'’s meet
in the bridge deck salon

35:34.523 --> 35:35.872
- for our tip meeting.
- Copy.

35:37.657 --> 35:39.441
Killer charter.
You guys did a great job.

35:39.441 --> 35:41.400
There'’s one thing
I want to address.

35:41.400 --> 35:45.273
Don'’t call the deck team until
it'’s one person in cabins.

35:45.273 --> 35:46.840
You had two in cabins.

35:46.840 --> 35:50.191
So then I woke people up off
their breaks to help you.

35:50.191 --> 35:52.280
Do you normally have
three or two on?

35:52.280 --> 35:53.760
Two.

35:53.760 --> 35:55.283
Because normally they'’ll
run plates with us.

35:55.283 --> 35:56.589
But I don'’t know what
they'’re doing tonight.

35:56.589 --> 35:58.025
We don'’t want to do that again.

35:58.025 --> 36:00.897
So I apologize because
I wasn'’t aware of that.

36:00.897 --> 36:02.377
Anyway.

36:02.377 --> 36:04.727
All right. So this tip,

36:04.727 --> 36:08.296
$23,000,
$1,700 per person.

36:08.296 --> 36:10.255
Yay.

36:10.255 --> 36:11.517
Very heavy.

36:12.692 --> 36:15.782
Nice work, everyone. Cheers.

36:15.782 --> 36:18.915
Cheers. Thank you.

36:18.915 --> 36:19.916
Have fun tonight.

36:23.137 --> 36:25.879
Everything has been scrubbed.

36:25.879 --> 36:28.577
I need a----ing shot.
Or four.

36:30.231 --> 36:32.973
I just need happiness
tonight and love and care.

36:32.973 --> 36:35.193
That green goblin comes out tonight.

36:35.193 --> 36:36.803
Oh, wow.

36:36.803 --> 36:38.065
And she said...

36:38.065 --> 36:39.109
This is the fun one.

36:39.109 --> 36:40.981
Oh, GTA.

36:48.858 --> 36:50.077
I'’m ready.

36:51.121 --> 36:52.514
Oh, my God.

36:52.514 --> 36:53.689
Tonight will be drama-free.

36:53.689 --> 36:54.908
This is sick, though.

36:54.908 --> 36:56.126
I just want
an espresso martini.

36:56.126 --> 36:57.171
Just get nine.

36:57.171 --> 37:00.479
- Oh.
- Yay!

37:00.479 --> 37:02.655
Ooh la la.

37:11.316 --> 37:13.405
- Mi amor.
- Mi amor.

37:13.405 --> 37:15.276
Yeah, that'’s me.
Thank you.

37:15.276 --> 37:18.497
Wow. Whatever that is, I'’m going
to have a piece of that.

37:18.497 --> 37:19.759
You got the best.

37:19.759 --> 37:21.630
- I got a bit of steak.
- Great.

37:21.630 --> 37:23.066
- Bon appetit.
- Bon appetit.

37:23.066 --> 37:24.807
I just want to say,
to be honest,

37:24.807 --> 37:26.940
I'’m going to get very drunk.

37:26.940 --> 37:30.030
So I apologize for anything
that comes out tonight.

37:30.030 --> 37:32.424
Now.

37:33.642 --> 37:35.122
Hakuna matata.

37:35.122 --> 37:37.080
- Baby...
- Bro.

37:37.080 --> 37:38.473
I can tell.

37:39.474 --> 37:40.606
Yeah.

37:43.957 --> 37:46.699
- Kyle.
- That'’s it. I'm done.

37:48.527 --> 37:50.224
You know what?

37:50.224 --> 37:52.444
All I'’m saying is, Kev, I think
it'’s time for us to talk.

37:52.444 --> 37:54.533
We good. We cool?
Or not.

37:56.143 --> 37:57.275
Coming up...

37:57.275 --> 37:58.711
So, Lily, she is dead weight.

37:58.711 --> 38:00.365
And it'’s frustrating me.

38:00.365 --> 38:02.758
It'’s frustrating Kyle.
And it'’s frustrating Jess.

38:02.758 --> 38:04.760
Okay, I'’m going to talk to Lily.

38:09.069 --> 38:11.811
All I'’m saying is, Chef, I think
it'’s time for us to talk.

38:11.811 --> 38:13.987
We good? We cool?
Or not?

38:13.987 --> 38:15.728
Oh, no.

38:40.013 --> 38:42.798
It'’s not combative.
It'’s not aggressive.

38:42.798 --> 38:44.887
I do not recognize these people.

38:47.412 --> 38:48.717
I feel the biggest
sense of relief.

38:48.717 --> 38:51.198
It'’s lifted the weight off
of my chest.

38:51.198 --> 38:54.244
Now I can drink with joy
and not drink to forget.

38:54.244 --> 38:55.724
Good job.

38:58.118 --> 39:00.555
Okay, let'’s pack up and go.

39:00.555 --> 39:02.905
This is our cars.
This is our cars.

39:04.385 --> 39:05.473
Guys, we'’re going!

39:05.473 --> 39:06.953
Hi.

39:09.434 --> 39:10.609
Oh.

39:13.568 --> 39:15.353
What was the best part
of your night?

39:15.353 --> 39:17.267
I don'’t know yet.
It hasn'’t finished.

39:17.267 --> 39:19.095
Wow.

39:19.095 --> 39:21.576
You----ing smash it, bro.
My turn.

39:29.367 --> 39:30.585
Let me take my...

39:30.585 --> 39:33.414
No, no. Cigarette.
No, it'’s finito.

39:36.461 --> 39:38.158
Wow.

39:38.158 --> 39:39.768
Come on, madam.

40:07.535 --> 40:08.884
Oh my God.

40:11.713 --> 40:13.846
Are you okay?

40:13.846 --> 40:15.587
There'’s something not
right with me right now.

40:15.587 --> 40:19.155
We should get you to the doctor.

40:19.155 --> 40:20.505
I feel like death

40:20.505 --> 40:23.464
and I just hope I don'’t
give it to anybody else.

40:23.464 --> 40:26.815
Yeah, this is Captain Sandy
off motor yacht Mustique.

40:26.815 --> 40:28.774
Can I get a ride
for a crew member?

40:28.774 --> 40:31.603
I need to get them
to the doctor.

40:31.603 --> 40:33.343
Okay.

40:44.659 --> 40:47.836
Bro, there is an emergency.
I need water.

40:48.837 --> 40:51.449
Get the towel.

40:51.449 --> 40:53.494
- Yeah.
- Oh, la, la.

40:53.494 --> 40:55.409
Why are you here?

40:55.409 --> 40:56.758
Sleep well?

40:57.629 --> 40:58.760
Too right?

41:00.675 --> 41:01.807
Sh--.

41:02.764 --> 41:04.200
Is that me?
Is it you?

41:04.200 --> 41:06.202
Max, get up. We'’re going to
start working. Come.

41:09.249 --> 41:11.512
We just need
to wipe the surfaces.

41:11.512 --> 41:13.688
Yeah.

41:16.778 --> 41:17.823
You can actually do this last.

41:17.823 --> 41:19.868
I just...

41:19.868 --> 41:21.348
I don'’t know what to do anymore.

41:21.348 --> 41:22.828
And you still have
to do the bridge.

41:22.828 --> 41:23.829
- I'’m here, my bro.
- Watch out, bro.

41:23.829 --> 41:24.830
It'’s acid.

41:24.830 --> 41:26.832
- Oh.
- Oh, my God.

41:28.834 --> 41:30.009
Can you meet me on the bridge?

41:30.009 --> 41:31.837
- Yeah, hope H comes back.
- Yeah.

41:31.837 --> 41:33.708
Well, then we'’re like
two and a half.

41:33.708 --> 41:35.014
Max is a half.

41:35.014 --> 41:36.363
Yeah, two and a quarter.

41:39.497 --> 41:40.454
Sh--.

41:40.454 --> 41:42.021
Okay, lay it on me.

41:42.021 --> 41:44.893
So, Lily, have nothing to say

41:44.893 --> 41:47.026
anything bad against
her personally.

41:47.026 --> 41:49.507
Work-wise?
She is dead weight.

41:49.507 --> 41:50.856
She'’s just not getting it.

41:50.856 --> 41:52.205
I made her do cabins on
her own this charter.

41:52.205 --> 41:53.554
Nothing was done.

41:53.554 --> 41:54.860
That'’s why there were
two people downstairs.

41:54.860 --> 41:56.557
Yes.
And it'’s frustrating me.

41:56.557 --> 41:58.864
It'’s frustrating Kyle.
And it'’s frustrating Jess.

41:58.864 --> 42:00.735
I'’m going to talk to Lily.

42:00.735 --> 42:02.520
She has to show you
she can do it.

42:02.520 --> 42:04.696
- Yeah.
- Otherwise, she'’s off the boat.

42:04.696 --> 42:06.045
Okay.

42:06.045 --> 42:08.047
Luka, what'’s wrong?

42:08.047 --> 42:09.352
- I'’m really tired.
- Me, too.

42:09.352 --> 42:10.571
Why?

42:10.571 --> 42:11.703
Migraine.

42:11.703 --> 42:12.834
Really?
Oh, sh--.

42:12.834 --> 42:14.227
How'’s that going?

42:14.227 --> 42:16.882
I'’m just exhausted now,
like, very tired.

42:16.882 --> 42:19.449
Hey, perfect timing.
I want to talk to you.

42:19.449 --> 42:20.799
Yeah.

42:20.799 --> 42:23.192
In my experience, being honest
is the only way

42:23.192 --> 42:24.672
to motivate a crew member.

42:24.672 --> 42:26.631
Come and sit.

42:26.631 --> 42:28.284
There'’s no sugarcoating this.

42:28.284 --> 42:32.201
So how are you doing
with your job?

42:32.201 --> 42:36.031
I haven'’t, like, done this
particular role in the same way.

42:36.031 --> 42:37.642
And so it was a lot of learning.

42:37.642 --> 42:39.078
Yeah.

42:39.078 --> 42:41.123
- So this is your third charter.
- Yeah.

42:41.123 --> 42:43.212
Do you think for
the turn-downs in the cabins,

42:43.212 --> 42:45.388
you can do them on your own?

42:45.388 --> 42:48.914
I need you to be more,
you know, aware.

42:48.914 --> 42:50.655
- Yeah.
- And have that initiative.

42:50.655 --> 42:52.265
Yeah.

42:52.265 --> 42:54.180
Because I really need you to be
able to do this on your own.

42:54.180 --> 42:55.834
Yeah.

42:55.834 --> 42:58.445
I have given you this opportunity.

42:59.751 --> 43:01.535
You will be exhausted.

43:01.535 --> 43:04.930
It'’s how you maintain
under those conditions

43:04.930 --> 43:06.801
is how I decide to keep crew.

43:08.107 --> 43:10.283
Give me a----ing break, honestly.

43:16.855 --> 43:18.204
Next time on
"Below Deck Mediterranean"...

43:18.204 --> 43:18.987
Woo!

43:18.987 --> 43:20.162
Get it, get it, get it.

43:21.337 --> 43:23.426
Mamasita.
They look good.

43:23.426 --> 43:25.472
Can I put some
censors on my eyes?

43:25.472 --> 43:26.778
It'’s really big.

43:26.778 --> 43:28.127
So much better
than the last boat.

43:28.127 --> 43:29.128
Repeat charter client.

43:29.128 --> 43:30.303
How was it the first time?

43:30.303 --> 43:31.260
Not good.

43:31.260 --> 43:32.958
We just lost our stabilizers.

43:32.958 --> 43:34.481
Where are the life jackets?

43:34.481 --> 43:36.309
They would like a
big gay breakfast.

43:36.309 --> 43:39.747
The chef special today
is rainbow pancakes.

43:39.747 --> 43:41.096
Food coloring.

43:41.096 --> 43:42.663
I know how to make it myself.

43:42.663 --> 43:43.969
I hate them already.

43:43.969 --> 43:45.535
Haleigh, how are you?

43:47.015 --> 43:48.582
- Tumi.
- What'’s up?

43:48.582 --> 43:50.018
I'’ve got the worst migraine.

43:53.369 --> 43:54.806
Don'’t ever lie to me again.

43:54.806 --> 43:56.024
- What?
- Max, you...

43:56.024 --> 43:57.547
What you did was wrong.

43:57.547 --> 43:59.811
All you need to do now
is say you'’re sorry.

43:59.811 --> 44:01.421
No.
