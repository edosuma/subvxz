00:44.170 --> 00:45.340
Mr. Kim.

00:47.969 --> 00:49.100
That night.

00:51.679 --> 00:54.350
Did you...

00:55.890 --> 00:56.979
kill...

00:59.439 --> 01:00.859
Ms. Hong Guk Hwa?

01:01.020 --> 01:06.989
(Building a Law-abiding Society Through Genuine Reform)

01:10.950 --> 01:12.329
I don't know.

01:15.659 --> 01:17.420
I don't know anymore.

01:20.750 --> 01:22.340
What does that mean?

01:23.049 --> 01:26.260
Does it mean there's a chance that you killed Ms. Hong?

01:33.890 --> 01:36.810
Mr. Kim, please answer the prosecutor's question.

01:44.069 --> 01:49.819
(Episode 7: Transformation)

01:55.950 --> 01:58.958
Hong Guk Hwa. You killed her, didn't you?

01:58.959 --> 02:00.079
It wasn't me.

02:00.329 --> 02:02.459
Whatever. It doesn't change the fact...

02:02.670 --> 02:04.590
that you'll have to sit in court...

02:04.670 --> 02:07.170
and provide an alibi for the time of death.

02:08.680 --> 02:10.930
Hey. I said it wasn't me.

02:17.099 --> 02:19.638
- Scumbag! - Scumbag!

02:19.639 --> 02:22.270
- Darn it! - Darn it!

02:25.689 --> 02:28.030
I guess you're trying to drag me into it,

02:28.860 --> 02:31.409
but I'm not an idiot.

02:31.870 --> 02:33.490
I won't fall for your tricks.

02:34.240 --> 02:35.240
Hey!

02:35.539 --> 02:39.209
Hey, arrest this jerk for attempted murder.

02:39.210 --> 02:40.750
- Now! - Gosh, that scared me.

02:40.830 --> 02:43.419
Put that down, and we'll talk. Come on. Put it down.

02:46.090 --> 02:47.090
I'm a police officer.

02:52.389 --> 02:54.300
- Hey. - Darn it.

03:08.360 --> 03:10.280
If you arrived even just a minute late,

03:11.110 --> 03:12.659
you'd be holding a funeral for me right now.

03:13.409 --> 03:16.699
Speeding in the rain nearly cost me my life.

03:17.740 --> 03:19.039
What is that?

03:20.000 --> 03:22.830
What do you think? Did you think I'd come here unarmed?

03:26.419 --> 03:28.339
How dare he throw an axe?

03:28.340 --> 03:30.468
Does he think he's an Apache or what?

03:30.469 --> 03:33.050
You're such a handful, seriously.

03:51.990 --> 03:53.068
Yes, Mr. Shin.

03:53.069 --> 03:54.740
Hi, Ms. Seo. How did it go?

03:54.949 --> 03:57.449
Did you manage to teach Prosecutor An a thing or two again?

03:58.490 --> 04:00.659
What about you? Is everything okay on your end?

04:01.039 --> 04:02.210
Ms. Seo.

04:03.580 --> 04:06.129
You sound upset. What happened?

04:20.350 --> 04:22.430
I think I ruined everything.

04:24.639 --> 04:26.980
I should have stopped him at all costs.

04:28.149 --> 04:29.269
What do you mean?

04:30.230 --> 04:31.230
What happened?

04:41.040 --> 04:42.329
I'm sorry.

04:47.079 --> 04:48.339
You see,

04:49.339 --> 04:50.839
even if you'd had me in the courtroom,

04:51.339 --> 04:53.259
the results would've been the same.

04:54.629 --> 04:56.889
Both you and Ms. Seo did your best.

05:01.970 --> 05:04.350
Don't worry too much, okay?

05:05.189 --> 05:08.810
It's not like they obtained new evidence by examining you.

05:10.360 --> 05:12.279
Nothing has changed.

05:12.439 --> 05:14.689
I think I saw her finger move.

05:18.110 --> 05:19.160
What?

05:20.529 --> 05:21.660
Guk Hwa.

05:22.699 --> 05:24.579
Initially, I had no recollection of seeing it.

05:27.459 --> 05:29.129
But I've thought about it,

05:31.750 --> 05:33.338
and I think I remember seeing her finger move.

05:33.339 --> 05:35.589
You're mistaken.

05:37.050 --> 05:38.720
The knife pierced her neck...

05:40.009 --> 05:41.930
and through her heart and lungs. She died on the spot.

05:42.310 --> 05:44.310
Even if her fingers did move,

05:44.430 --> 05:46.310
that's called "rigor mortis."

05:46.769 --> 05:49.399
It's commonly seen in violent deaths.

05:51.649 --> 05:53.399
I should get back to my cell.

05:56.360 --> 05:58.610
Hey, just shake it off.

06:00.620 --> 06:02.579
It's okay. You have me, you know.

06:03.740 --> 06:04.740

Darn it.

08:21.920 --> 08:23.180
Darn...

08:58.419 --> 09:00.840
I heard you said in the courtroom that you don't know.

09:03.049 --> 09:05.178
At first, you insisted that you didn't remember anything.

09:05.179 --> 09:07.970
And now, you don't know whether or not you killed her?

09:16.190 --> 09:17.519
What is the truth?

09:21.899 --> 09:23.529
Here's what I'm wondering.

09:24.649 --> 09:27.490
Maybe you do remember what happened, but you just want...

09:28.529 --> 09:30.159
to believe that you didn't kill her.

09:36.210 --> 09:37.370
Wake up!

Wake up!

Attention!

09:58.850 --> 10:00.190
Straighten your uniform.

10:05.779 --> 10:06.899
Hey, you.

10:07.029 --> 10:09.159

After acting innocent and all.

10:18.669 --> 10:20.250
Recover position!

10:28.840 --> 10:31.089
He said, "I don't know."

10:31.090 --> 10:34.220
Do you think it could be interpreted as an admission of guilt?

10:34.429 --> 10:38.100
He could insist that he did not want to give false testimony...

10:38.600 --> 10:39.980
when he really wasn't sure.

10:40.649 --> 10:44.479
However, it's true that most judges would shyly interpret it...

10:44.480 --> 10:47.028
as an admission of guilt.

10:47.029 --> 10:50.740
Many are speculating that the prosecution...

10:50.909 --> 10:52.950
- will ask for the death penalty. - Hey, kid.

10:53.700 --> 10:55.369
- You're done for. - As for Kim Hyun Soo,

10:55.370 --> 10:57.450
- the suspect in this case... - So what now?

10:58.120 --> 11:00.418
His crimes are quite heinous.

11:00.419 --> 11:04.589
That means the prosecution could ask for the death penalty.

11:04.590 --> 11:06.918

Guk Hwa said she used drugs when she was studying in the US.

26:24.920 --> 26:26.630
Did you...

26:28.390 --> 26:30.179
have sex with Ms. Hong?

26:30.180 --> 26:32.390
(Defendant)

26:34.390 --> 26:35.980
Do I have to answer this question?

26:36.099 --> 26:38.479
The victim was stabbed 13 times by an unidentified male,

26:38.480 --> 26:41.399
which was the direct cause of her death.

26:41.400 --> 26:42.519
In such a case,

26:43.019 --> 26:44.900
it's normal to suspect that it may have been a crime of passion.

26:46.109 --> 26:48.410
Yes. Once, just because we were drunk.

26:49.279 --> 26:50.410
I did sleep with her once.

26:51.369 --> 26:54.789
You spoke with Ms. Hong on the phone on the day of the incident.

26:55.829 --> 26:57.250
Did you have plans to see her that day?

26:59.289 --> 27:02.879
Look. That crazy girl threatened me.

27:02.880 --> 27:04.880
We slept together just because we were drunk.

27:06.210 --> 27:09.130
When my girlfriend found out, she lied to her that I raped her.

27:09.970 --> 27:12.140
Gosh, it still makes me so angry.

27:13.180 --> 27:15.809
Then you probably wanted to kill her, right?

27:15.930 --> 27:17.019
Objection, Your Honour.

27:18.140 --> 27:20.348
Mr. Um is here as a witness,

27:20.349 --> 27:22.230
but the counsel is treating him...

27:22.769 --> 27:24.609
like a suspect.

27:24.730 --> 27:25.980
Objection sustained.

27:26.440 --> 27:28.950
Counsel, please be careful.

27:30.200 --> 27:32.119
It is true that I was fuming mad,

27:32.779 --> 27:36.119
but I wasn't angry enough to kill her. I'm not like that jerk.

27:39.920 --> 27:41.880
Mr. Um.

27:43.420 --> 27:45.589
Did the police interview you at all with regard to this case?

27:45.710 --> 27:47.548
Either about the drugs...

27:47.549 --> 27:49.589
or your relationship with the victim.

27:50.089 --> 27:51.130
No.

27:56.009 --> 27:58.099
When you found out that Ms. Hong, your roommate,

27:59.309 --> 28:02.900
had sexual intercourse with Mr. Um who was your boyfriend,

28:04.819 --> 28:06.190
how did you feel?

28:06.319 --> 28:07.940
I was freaking miserable, obviously.

28:08.069 --> 28:10.650
Witness, you're in a courtroom now.

28:10.990 --> 28:12.200
Please watch what you say.

28:14.450 --> 28:16.450
A week before Ms. Hong's death,

28:17.329 --> 28:20.789
the two of you had a big fight because of that,

28:20.869 --> 28:22.039
and you were hurt pretty badly.

28:22.250 --> 28:23.710
We did fight,

28:24.170 --> 28:25.669
but you know what happens in a cat fight.

28:25.670 --> 28:27.170
Just pulling each other's hair, that's all.

28:28.920 --> 28:30.048
(Defence)

28:30.049 --> 28:31.220
Then how come...

28:32.380 --> 28:35.680
the doctor thought your injury required three weeks of treatment?

28:42.519 --> 28:44.649
After the fight, you packed up and moved out. Then a week later,

28:44.650 --> 28:45.769
on the day of the incident,

28:46.519 --> 28:49.069
you called Ms. Hong.

28:49.319 --> 28:51.950
Correct. Let's be honest. I was wronged,

28:52.569 --> 28:54.490
so I thought she owed me an apology,

28:54.700 --> 28:57.740
and I had to pick up my belongings that I had left at her place.

28:58.079 --> 28:59.160
That's why I called her.

29:01.160 --> 29:04.039
But she didn't pick up, and she ignored my texts too.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.420
That must've made you angry.

29:09.630 --> 29:10.630
No, not at all.

29:10.920 --> 29:13.589
I had already made up my mind to break up with Ki Jong,

29:13.930 --> 29:15.679
and I was hoping Guk Hwa and I could put it behind us...

29:15.680 --> 29:17.430
and patch things up.

29:35.779 --> 29:38.329
Ms. Yoon, then did the police ever ask you...

29:38.869 --> 29:41.409
to come in for an interview regarding this case?

29:41.410 --> 29:42.410
No.

29:42.910 --> 29:45.039
You had a big falling-out with the victim,

29:45.579 --> 29:47.710
and your boyfriend cheated on you with her.

29:48.210 --> 29:50.589
I'd say you definitely had a motive for killing her.

29:51.250 --> 29:53.470
But they never even asked you to come in for an interview?

29:53.509 --> 29:55.470
Why should I be questioned? I didn't kill her.

29:56.759 --> 29:58.599
That guy is the killer.

30:15.650 --> 30:19.160
Why? We haven't confirmed whether their alibis check out.

30:19.410 --> 30:21.829
When they were testifying in court,

30:21.990 --> 30:23.869
they didn't get defensive at all.

30:24.329 --> 30:26.210
They said everything without a second's hesitation.

30:26.789 --> 30:28.669
That can only be done...

30:28.670 --> 30:31.500
when people know for a fact that they're telling the truth.

30:31.920 --> 30:34.970
But the thing is, they were in a relationship.

30:35.049 --> 30:36.930
Maybe they talked to get their story straight.

30:37.009 --> 30:38.049
No.

30:39.089 --> 30:41.140
Even if they did, it doesn't matter.

30:41.430 --> 30:44.140

30:44.269 --> 30:46.389
can't lie easily...

30:46.390 --> 30:48.480

30:48.809 --> 30:50.359

46:00.019 --> 46:01.980
That has nothing to do with this case.

46:03.099 --> 46:05.849
I do not feel the need to answer this question.

46:07.309 --> 46:09.230
In August of 2017,

46:09.650 --> 46:12.400
you were sentenced to three years in prison...

46:14.989 --> 46:17.320

46:19.079 --> 46:20.659
Like I said,

46:21.750 --> 46:25.079
that has nothing to do with this case.

46:39.219 --> 46:42.389
You followed Ms. Hong all the way to the park by the Han River.

46:45.349 --> 46:46.480
That was just a coincidence.

46:46.730 --> 46:48.769
She had filed a complaint against you.

46:49.269 --> 46:50.899
You ran into her at the gas station by chance...

46:50.900 --> 46:53.569
and just happened to run into her again at the park.

46:53.570 --> 46:56.699

46:57.820 --> 46:59.780
Now, can that be called a coincidence?

47:00.949 --> 47:02.079
Then maybe...

47:03.579 --> 47:04.750
it was fate.

47:10.630 --> 47:12.090

47:13.090 --> 47:15.340

47:15.800 --> 47:17.550
was turned off for about an hour.

47:19.889 --> 47:21.429

47:22.179 --> 47:24.679
Well, it happens from time to time.

47:44.329 --> 47:46.539
When did the police interview you?

47:46.619 --> 47:48.289
They never did.

47:49.539 --> 47:52.130
You have priors and were holding a grudge against the victim.

47:53.300 --> 47:55.510
On top of that, you ran into her that night.

47:56.260 --> 47:58.509
Then you disabled your ankle monitor...

47:58.510 --> 48:01.050
and followed her all the way to the park,

48:02.679 --> 48:05.139
yet the police never bothered to interview you?

48:05.969 --> 48:07.019
Correct.

48:07.519 --> 48:08.559
My gosh.

48:11.480 --> 48:14.730
Mr. Lee, why do you think the police didn't ask you to come in?

48:15.650 --> 48:17.110
I guess they know...

48:17.989 --> 48:19.449
that I didn't kill her.

48:20.699 --> 48:22.698
Can you provide an alibi for the time of the incident?

48:22.699 --> 48:24.578
(Witness)

48:24.579 --> 48:25.659
An alibi?

48:27.250 --> 48:28.369
Honestly,

48:29.409 --> 48:31.329
I really can't wrap my head around this.

48:33.289 --> 48:34.839
The man who slept with her...

48:34.840 --> 48:36.840
and was found with the murder weapon...

48:38.130 --> 48:39.380
is right there.

48:41.469 --> 48:43.760
Why must I provide an alibi?

48:48.559 --> 48:51.389
(Judge)

49:02.739 --> 49:07.329
(Criminal Procedure Act)

49:14.250 --> 49:15.539
My phone.

49:16.380 --> 49:18.300
Did you give it to Park Doo Sik?

49:25.429 --> 49:26.469
Why?

49:32.809 --> 49:34.150
Why did you do that?

49:37.570 --> 49:39.230
I had no choice.

49:40.530 --> 49:41.900
I need to survive in this place too.

49:52.369 --> 49:53.829
Thanks for everything anyway.

51:25.170 --> 51:26.879
(Keyless Door Lock at Victim's Residence)

51:26.880 --> 51:29.590
Ms. Hong had a keyless electronic door lock system installed.

51:29.929 --> 51:32.058
As you know, anyone who knows the door code can get in.

51:32.059 --> 51:33.888
And it was an older model, which can be disabled...

51:33.889 --> 51:35.889
with a stun gun or the master code.

51:37.440 --> 51:39.598
(Rear Door to Terrace Left Open Due to Broken Doorknob)

51:39.599 --> 51:41.150
What about these photos?

51:41.650 --> 51:45.070
The door to the terrace was unlocked as the doorknob was broken,

51:45.320 --> 51:47.820
so anyone could've come into the house.

51:48.780 --> 51:50.279
Are you saying...

51:50.280 --> 51:53.159
it is possible that there was an intruder that night?

51:53.369 --> 51:57.158
I will just say that the possibility cannot be totally ruled out.

51:57.159 --> 51:58.289
Objection, Your Honour.

51:59.920 --> 52:03.590
The possibility that there might have been an unknown intruder...

52:04.170 --> 52:06.380
has nothing to do with the defendant's charges...

52:06.800 --> 52:08.929
and why the prosecution decided to indict him.

52:09.179 --> 52:11.599
It is completely irrelevant.

52:15.929 --> 52:17.598
You also pointed out...

52:17.599 --> 52:20.150
that there may have been another weapon.

52:20.309 --> 52:23.319
Correct. A knife, which could have been used in the murder,

52:23.320 --> 52:24.940
is unaccounted for.

52:26.820 --> 52:28.489
- Is this it? - Yes.

52:29.239 --> 52:30.279
(8-Piece Knife Set, 2 Missing Knives)

52:30.280 --> 52:33.619
This is an eight-piece kitchen knife set.

52:33.739 --> 52:35.329
They all look slightly different,

52:35.699 --> 52:37.249
but the set is missing two knives.

52:37.250 --> 52:38.250
One of them...

52:38.960 --> 52:41.789
is the knife, which the prosecution insists was used in the murder.

52:41.920 --> 52:42.960
But...

52:43.750 --> 52:45.630
where is the other one, then?

52:46.670 --> 52:47.959
(Missing Knife)

52:47.960 --> 52:50.799
This photo was taken at the scene shortly after the incident.

52:50.800 --> 52:53.969
As you can see, there was leftover fruit,

52:54.679 --> 52:57.679
but the knife that was used to peel the fruit is missing.

52:57.809 --> 52:58.888
Objection, Your Honour.

52:58.889 --> 53:00.059
(Judge)

53:00.809 --> 53:01.900
All right.

53:02.809 --> 53:05.940
By saying there might be another possible murder weapon...

53:06.820 --> 53:09.440
fully knowing Mr. Kim was found with the murder weapon on him,

53:09.949 --> 53:12.109
the counsel is trying to distort such clear evidence.

53:12.110 --> 53:14.530
It's nothing more than the counsel's subjective speculation.

53:14.570 --> 53:17.539
And therefore, it is inadmissible.

53:17.789 --> 53:18.949
Objection sustained.

53:24.880 --> 53:28.710
What you're looking at is the photo of the victim's right hand.

53:29.010 --> 53:30.469
Could you elaborate on this?

53:31.010 --> 53:33.800
Her hand was probably penetrated due to a knife game.

53:34.179 --> 53:36.718
Your findings don't match that of the medical examiner...

53:36.719 --> 53:37.929
who conducted the autopsy.

53:38.559 --> 53:40.098
Could you explain why?

53:40.099 --> 53:42.058
Traces of a fluorescence brightening agent...

53:42.059 --> 53:44.018
and formaldehyde were found in the wound.

53:44.019 --> 53:46.939
The combination of those chemicals is found mostly in toilet paper.

53:46.940 --> 53:48.190
It indicates that someone tried to stop the bleeding.

53:48.440 --> 53:50.739
Oh, no. My gosh!

53:53.030 --> 53:56.029
Evidence which points to a knife game...

53:56.030 --> 53:58.079
can be found on her dining table.

53:59.449 --> 54:02.908
As you can see, this proves that the victim...

54:02.909 --> 54:05.960
often engaged in the dangerous knife game.

54:08.460 --> 54:12.550
The prosecution claims that the wound was inflicted on her...

54:12.969 --> 54:14.468
when the knife slipped...

54:14.469 --> 54:17.138
from hitting her spine.

54:17.139 --> 54:18.348
Do you agree?

54:18.349 --> 54:20.099
I don't see how that can be true.

54:20.469 --> 54:22.059
Could you elaborate?

54:22.519 --> 54:24.479
If you look at her wounds,

54:24.480 --> 54:27.769
you will see that the blade was facing up.

54:28.860 --> 54:29.860
Like this?

54:30.190 --> 54:32.239
Yes, according to those wounds,

54:32.610 --> 54:34.448
the killer held the knife...

54:34.449 --> 54:38.030
with the blade facing up when stabbing her.

54:38.329 --> 54:39.779
So what would happen...

54:39.780 --> 54:41.239
if the knife slipped from one's grip?

54:44.369 --> 54:47.710
If the killer was wounded from such an event,

54:48.539 --> 54:52.380
the wound should be found on the inside of his hand.

54:53.050 --> 54:55.178
As the report states,

54:55.179 --> 54:56.799
on the broken glass of the front door,

54:56.800 --> 54:58.388
the defendant's blood, epithelial tissue,

54:58.389 --> 55:00.009
and DNA were found.

55:00.010 --> 55:02.679
So he suffered the wound...

55:03.019 --> 55:04.479
in the way he testified to.

55:04.480 --> 55:07.019
From cutting himself on the broken glass.

55:08.519 --> 55:10.269
My witness' findings...

55:10.860 --> 55:13.859
go directly against those of the medical examiner...

55:13.860 --> 55:16.280
who conducted the autopsy.

55:16.570 --> 55:18.619
Does the prosecution have an objection?

55:20.280 --> 55:22.949
How the wound was inflicted could be debatable...

55:24.829 --> 55:26.039
which is why it will heavily rely...

55:26.789 --> 55:29.669
on the judgement of the jury and judges.

55:29.670 --> 55:32.000
(Judge)

55:40.050 --> 55:44.559
Mr. Kim, could you write your name on that piece of paper?

55:52.320 --> 55:58.280
(Kim Hyun Soo)

56:00.199 --> 56:02.698
Dr. Hong, what is shown on the screen?

56:02.699 --> 56:06.448
It's the analysis report of the 13 wounds on the victim's body.

56:06.449 --> 56:08.038
The analysis...

56:08.039 --> 56:10.078
helps us identify the suspect's traits.

56:10.079 --> 56:11.289
And what would that be?

56:11.960 --> 56:14.589
Eight out of the thirteen wounds were inflicted...

56:14.590 --> 56:16.840
from the 1 o'clock position to the 7 o'clock position.

56:18.469 --> 56:23.260
One can presume that the killer is right-handed.

56:23.849 --> 56:26.849
I see. But as you just saw,

56:27.730 --> 56:29.269
the defendant...

56:30.519 --> 56:32.019
is left-handed.

56:33.820 --> 56:36.229
The fact that he is left-handed...

56:36.230 --> 56:39.069
can be proved through multiple evidence.

56:39.070 --> 56:40.569
He writes with his left hand,

56:40.570 --> 56:41.699
plays table tennis with his left arm,

56:42.119 --> 56:44.238
and plays badminton with his left arm too.

56:44.239 --> 56:45.239
I object!

56:45.489 --> 56:47.578
- Counsel is displaying... - This...

56:47.579 --> 56:49.709
is the report written by the NFS medical examiner...

56:49.710 --> 56:50.869
who conducted the autopsy.

56:52.380 --> 56:53.920
Let's see. "The probability..."

56:54.789 --> 56:57.010
"of the killer being right-handed..."

56:59.300 --> 57:00.300
"is high."

57:04.260 --> 57:05.260
High.

57:08.480 --> 57:09.480
High!

57:16.480 --> 57:17.480
That'll be all.

57:23.989 --> 57:25.329
You may cross-examine.

57:28.449 --> 57:29.449
Dr. Hong,

57:31.159 --> 57:33.118
you are a senior researcher at the NFS...

57:33.119 --> 57:35.129
and teach forensic medicine at a college.

57:35.130 --> 57:36.419
- That's right. - Right.

57:36.420 --> 57:39.050
Were you assigned to this case?

57:39.630 --> 57:40.630
No.

57:40.719 --> 57:42.299
Then why are you here today?

57:42.300 --> 57:45.929
Could there be a particular reason?

57:46.889 --> 57:49.219
My presence was requested by Lawyer Shin Joong Han.

57:51.940 --> 57:54.729
Do you have a close relationship with him?

57:54.730 --> 57:56.190
We used to be married.

57:56.440 --> 57:58.569
I'm sure that's what you were fishing for.

57:58.570 --> 57:59.650
I see.

58:00.360 --> 58:04.319
So you must have taken on this case for Mr. Shin's sake.

58:04.320 --> 58:06.698
This I can say with certainty.

58:06.699 --> 58:07.949
Not at all.

58:08.369 --> 58:10.448
I can't really stand the man...

58:10.449 --> 58:11.659
which is why I divorced him.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.420
Then why are you here testifying?

58:16.250 --> 58:17.459
I believe that...

58:17.460 --> 58:21.170
the medical examiner's report is biased.

58:21.969 --> 58:24.129
Despite there being other possibilities,

58:24.130 --> 58:26.969
he presumed that the defendant was guilty.

58:27.300 --> 58:28.309
The issue is that...

58:28.639 --> 58:33.139
the jury believed his testimony to be the only truth.

58:34.139 --> 58:37.689
I am here today to inform everyone...

58:37.690 --> 58:40.860
that certain evidence can be interpreted differently.

58:41.530 --> 58:46.159
After all, the jury has a right to hear from various experts.

58:47.489 --> 58:49.409
You too, Ms. An.

58:54.579 --> 58:56.420
Thank you for pointing out the basics.

58:57.000 --> 58:58.000
That'll be all.

58:58.001 --> 59:01.510
(Defendant)

59:23.489 --> 59:25.899
(When in doubt, in favour of the defendant.)

59:25.900 --> 59:28.320
(No one is presumed to be guilty.)

59:46.800 --> 59:48.639
So what should I call you?

59:50.889 --> 59:52.179
Anything you want.

1:00:09.030 --> 1:00:11.118
(When in doubt, in favour of the defendant.)

1:00:11.119 --> 1:00:13.239
(No one is presumed to be guilty.)

1:00:16.789 --> 1:00:17.789
Ji Tae.

1:00:20.460 --> 1:00:21.710
I'm curious though.

1:00:34.389 --> 1:00:36.599
Do you really believe that I didn't kill her?

1:00:39.059 --> 1:00:40.059
Hong Guk Hwa, I mean.

1:00:55.539 --> 1:00:56.909
What if I did though?
