WEBVTT

00:05.271 --> 00:05.972
- Tonight on
the "Below Deck Med"

00:07.407 --> 00:10.176
Season six reunion...
- Rose all day?

00:10.210 --> 00:12.645
- You saw everyone naked?
- I saw Katie naked,

00:12.679 --> 00:16.449
Mzi naked, David naked.
- It was a sh--show, basically.

00:16.483 --> 00:19.953
- Malia, you are with hot Jake
the engineer, right?

00:19.986 --> 00:21.855
[cheering]

00:21.888 --> 00:23.890
What happens in [indistinct]
stays in [indistinct]

00:23.923 --> 00:26.059
- I want whatever
you're having right now.

00:26.092 --> 00:28.128
See who stands up
for themselves,

00:28.161 --> 00:30.697
and who stands
the F down.

00:30.730 --> 00:34.067
Did you realize you were
losing Captain Sandy's trust?

00:34.100 --> 00:35.602
- I wasn't about to throw him
under the bus.

00:35.635 --> 00:37.671
- You're Achilles heel
is your own self.

00:37.704 --> 00:40.707
- Lexi, her behavior in general
was quite sh----.

00:40.740 --> 00:42.509
- Production
actually stepped up,

00:42.542 --> 00:44.744
because it was getting
so out of hand.

00:44.778 --> 00:46.813
- Do you regret
your decision, Katie?

00:46.846 --> 00:49.416
- I was so f---ing
over this sh--

00:49.449 --> 00:50.750
- Quite frankly,
I didn't wanna be a stew.

00:50.784 --> 00:53.286
- When I watched the show,
I was just like, oh, my god.

00:53.319 --> 00:55.221
- Sandy's one of the worst
captains I've ever worked with

00:55.255 --> 00:56.623
in my 15 years on boats.

00:56.656 --> 00:58.892
- You-you just don't know
when to not talk.

00:58.925 --> 01:01.828
- "Below Deck Med Reunion"
starts now.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.834
Hey, everybody, welcome to
the "Below Deck Mediterranean"

01:07.867 --> 01:09.803
season six reunion.

01:09.836 --> 01:11.938
I'm your host,
Andy Cohen,

01:11.971 --> 01:14.574
thrilled to be joined
by a crew of yachties

01:14.607 --> 01:16.843
in a remote
interview setting,

01:16.876 --> 01:19.479
even though they technically
do their best work

01:19.512 --> 01:21.147
when they're
in a hot tub.

01:21.181 --> 01:22.382
Hey, Captain Sandy.

01:22.415 --> 01:24.217
- Hi, Andy,
thanks for having me.

01:24.250 --> 01:27.387
- Sandy, where are you?
- In the Med.

01:27.420 --> 01:30.090
- And we've got
Chief Stew Katie Flood.

01:30.123 --> 01:31.858
Hi, Katie.
- What's up, Andy?

01:31.891 --> 01:35.462
Katie, where are you?
- I'm in Seattle.

01:35.495 --> 01:40.433
- Wow, okay. And if it isn't
our intrepid bosun,

01:40.467 --> 01:42.802
Malia White.
Hi, Malia.

01:42.836 --> 01:44.971
- Hi, Andy.
- Good to see you.

01:45.005 --> 01:48.508
- Hey, Chef Mathew Shea.
- Ahoy, ahoy, Andy.

01:48.541 --> 01:51.311
- Mat, you know you need
to keep your clothes on

01:51.344 --> 01:54.647
at this party, right?
- Yep, just today, yep.

01:54.681 --> 01:56.516
Just for you.
- All right,

01:56.549 --> 01:58.618
let's say hi
to our dickhands.

01:58.651 --> 02:00.887
Hi, David Pascoe.
- Hi.

02:00.920 --> 02:04.224
- Is your bruise totally healed?
- Yeah, bruise is totally gone.

02:04.257 --> 02:07.060
- Very good.
Hey, Lloyd Spencer.

02:07.093 --> 02:09.229
- Hey, how's it going, Andy?
- Great.

02:09.262 --> 02:11.064
It looks like you
survived the crossing,

02:11.064 --> 02:13.133
but your mustache
did not.

02:13.166 --> 02:16.503
- No, but I do have one
in spare here.

02:16.536 --> 02:21.074
- Ahh. Let's say hi
to Zee Dempers. Hey, Zee.

02:21.107 --> 02:23.643
- Hi, Andy, how you doing?
- Good.

02:23.677 --> 02:27.614
I love your new hair.
- Thank you, thank you, stop it.

02:27.647 --> 02:31.151
- And finally,
if I play my cards right,

02:31.184 --> 02:33.620
she just might call me
daddy tonight.

02:33.653 --> 02:36.222
It's second stew
Courtney Veale.

02:36.256 --> 02:39.459
- Hey, zaddy!
[laughter]

02:39.492 --> 02:42.929
- All right. We invited
Lexi to join us tonight,

02:42.962 --> 02:44.164
but unfortunately,

02:44.197 --> 02:49.102
she very firmly
declined our invitation.

02:49.135 --> 02:51.971
A little bit later we will be
joined by Delaney.

02:52.005 --> 02:55.108
It'll be interesting
to hear what she has to say.

02:55.108 --> 02:57.110
We'll get into that
and a whole lot more

02:57.110 --> 02:58.144
in a little bit.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.879
You might've spent
this season

02:59.913 --> 03:03.350
'shipping David and Malia
or Courtney and Zee,

03:03.383 --> 03:05.685
but those matches went together
about as well

03:05.719 --> 03:08.054
as David's leg
and the hot tub.

03:08.088 --> 03:10.890
Let's take a look
at some boatmances

03:10.924 --> 03:13.793
aboard Lady Michelle.
[laughter]

03:13.827 --> 03:15.528
- I think Malia looks
beautiful, hey?

03:15.562 --> 03:17.097
It's definitely
a new dynamic

03:17.130 --> 03:20.600
being attracted to someone
who's my boss.

03:20.633 --> 03:22.502
- Yes, Zaddy!

03:22.535 --> 03:24.537
- Oh, it's
falling off now.

03:24.571 --> 03:25.605
- Oh, my god.

03:25.638 --> 03:30.243
- I just wanna be single
and, like, yeah.

03:30.276 --> 03:31.578
- Savage!

03:31.611 --> 03:34.247
Um, (BLEEP) my life.

03:34.280 --> 03:35.648
Do you like me?

03:35.682 --> 03:36.883
- I feel like
we're just, like,

03:36.916 --> 03:38.718
we've got a good
friendship thing going.

03:38.752 --> 03:40.553
- Oh!

03:40.587 --> 03:42.956
[indistinct shouting]

03:42.989 --> 03:44.724
- Hmm.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.459
- Thank you.
Are these from you?

03:46.493 --> 03:48.094
- These are from everyone.
- Oh!

03:48.128 --> 03:50.397
Obviously it's so nice of him,
but it's just awkward.

03:50.430 --> 03:53.767
[laughter]
Oh, god.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.301
- Malia, Hillary T.
wants to know

03:55.335 --> 03:57.804
"the moment for you
when you first realized

03:57.837 --> 03:59.572
"David might have
feelings for you,

03:59.606 --> 04:01.541
and did you ever
find it annoying?"

04:01.574 --> 04:03.476
- No, I never
found it annoying.

04:03.510 --> 04:07.080
Um, and I think it was probably
our first drunken night.

04:07.113 --> 04:08.148
[laughter]

04:08.181 --> 04:10.316
- Um--
- Or maybe our second.

04:10.350 --> 04:13.820
- I'm just curious
on a scale of 1-10

04:13.853 --> 04:16.690
how awkward was it watching
David confess to Malia

04:16.723 --> 04:18.892
that he had feelings for her?
[wretching]

04:18.925 --> 04:20.560
- I didn't even know
this happened!

04:20.593 --> 04:23.196
[laughter]
- Love you, David,

04:23.229 --> 04:25.699
but that was hard to watch.
- Tell me about it.

04:25.732 --> 04:28.735
- Um, David, Arian B.
wants to know,

04:28.768 --> 04:29.903
"if you were just lonely,

04:29.936 --> 04:31.671
"or did you actually
get over

04:31.705 --> 04:33.873
"your feelings for Malia
that quickly

04:33.907 --> 04:36.609
when you wanted
to hook up with Delaney."

04:36.643 --> 04:38.278
[laughter]
- I wanted to hook up

04:38.311 --> 04:39.679
with Delaney.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.481
I'm definitely
taking a shot.

04:41.514 --> 04:42.782
- Oh, my!

04:42.816 --> 04:45.985
- I think there's something
really lost in that.

04:46.086 --> 04:48.254
What David wanted more
at that moment in time

04:48.288 --> 04:50.824
was a guest bed,
not so much...

04:50.857 --> 04:53.893
- Oh, wow.
- I dunno, David!

04:53.927 --> 04:56.096
- Oh, my god,
that's savage.

04:56.096 --> 04:58.865
That is savage.

04:58.898 --> 05:02.502
The bed over the lady,
oh, my god.

05:02.535 --> 05:05.038
- Delaney's got
an amazing bod, you know?

05:05.038 --> 05:07.574
- Delaney has a banging body.
I mean, I--

05:07.607 --> 05:09.109
- Yeah,
a bit too late today.

05:09.142 --> 05:12.112
- Erica R.
Facebooked David

05:12.145 --> 05:14.414
and wants to know
"if anyone's ever told you

05:14.447 --> 05:17.183
that you look like one of
the Gibb brothers."

05:17.217 --> 05:21.454
The Bee-Gees?
[laughter]

05:21.488 --> 05:23.423
What do you think,
David?

05:23.456 --> 05:25.892
- It's the teeth though,
isn't it? That's all it is.

05:25.925 --> 05:30.296
- Wow, okay.
Um, Courtney and Zee,

05:30.330 --> 05:32.966
how would you rate each other's
lap dancing skills?

05:33.066 --> 05:38.138
- Yes, daddy!
[cheering]

05:38.171 --> 05:40.473
[laughter]

05:40.507 --> 05:42.809
- Zee had great
lap dancing skills.

05:42.842 --> 05:46.813
Um, I love it--
on me and the guests.

05:46.846 --> 05:49.849
- Zee?
[overlapping chatter]

05:49.883 --> 05:52.385
- I feel like it was
more intense on the guests,

05:52.419 --> 05:55.622
with that face they had.
[cheering]

06:00.660 --> 06:03.897
- No, Courtney was, uh--
Courtney was 10 out of 10.

06:03.930 --> 06:06.232
- Wow, Courtney,
Pamela K. said,

06:06.266 --> 06:08.568
"you said you see Zee
as just a friend,

06:08.601 --> 06:11.304
"however there seemed to be
an attraction there,

06:11.338 --> 06:14.808
or do you just make out with
your guy friends all the time?"

06:14.841 --> 06:17.310
- Um...
[laughter]

06:17.344 --> 06:19.813
No, I don't make out with
my guy friends all the time.

06:19.846 --> 06:21.681
Zee was a special one.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.683
No, I think it was more just
the fact that, like,

06:23.717 --> 06:25.652
we had such a great, like,
friendship connection,

06:25.685 --> 06:27.120
like, obviously
when we were sober.

06:27.153 --> 06:29.189
And then when we did get drunk,
we were always, like,

06:29.222 --> 06:30.590
the ones dancing
and, like,

06:30.623 --> 06:33.193
we always had this, like,
weird, like, vibe,

06:33.226 --> 06:35.362
connection when we were,
like, yeah, drunk.

06:35.395 --> 06:36.463
- So I'm curious,

06:36.496 --> 06:39.933
what is everyone's
relationship status now?

06:39.966 --> 06:43.269
Courtney, you are...
- Single.

06:43.303 --> 06:45.772
- Zee?
- I'm single.

06:45.805 --> 06:49.909
- Zee's single. Lloyd?
- In a relationship.

06:49.943 --> 06:53.446
- Ah.
- Ooh!

06:53.480 --> 06:54.614
- Spicy!

06:54.647 --> 06:58.785
- With a fellow, uh,
crewmember?

06:58.818 --> 07:01.488
- Uh, as of tomorrow
at 10 PM

07:01.521 --> 07:03.123
when their flight
comes in, yep.

07:03.156 --> 07:05.291
- Lloyd, it was--
it was really touching

07:05.325 --> 07:08.194
watching you open up
about who you are

07:08.228 --> 07:10.764
and your sexuality
with the rest of the crew.

07:10.797 --> 07:16.403
I would assume that not only had
to be hard to do personally,

07:16.436 --> 07:18.905
but knowing that would air
on television,

07:18.938 --> 07:24.044
um, had to also be, you know,
challenging emotionally.

07:24.044 --> 07:26.680
- Uh, definitely. At the time
I wasn't thinking about

07:26.713 --> 07:28.081
it coming out on TV.

07:28.114 --> 07:29.716
Uh, I'd had a few drinks,

07:29.749 --> 07:31.117
so I was really caught up
in the moment.

07:31.151 --> 07:34.788
But I've had incredible support
on social media.

07:34.821 --> 07:37.390
Um, there's been
the odd idiot,

07:37.424 --> 07:39.426
but other than that
I've had hundreds

07:39.459 --> 07:41.094
or more like
probably thousands

07:41.127 --> 07:42.896
of really, really kind
messages from people

07:42.929 --> 07:44.064
all over the world.

07:44.097 --> 07:46.499
And, yeah, I'm back
in the industry.

07:46.533 --> 07:48.234
I'm working on a boat,
as you can see.

07:48.268 --> 07:51.705
And, yeah, everything
has been incredible.

07:51.738 --> 07:53.940
I've been very, very fortunate
with the boat

07:53.973 --> 07:55.375
and the crew that
I've got at the moment.

07:55.408 --> 07:58.945
- That's great. David?
- Single.

07:58.978 --> 08:02.515
- Mat, I know you're single.
- Yeah, thank you.

08:02.549 --> 08:04.484
[laughter]
- And Katie is...

08:04.517 --> 08:08.655
- Um, mine is complicated.
- Yours is complicated.

08:08.688 --> 08:12.692
And, Malia, you are with
hot Jake the engineer, right?

08:12.726 --> 08:15.628
[cheering]

08:15.662 --> 08:17.697
- Below Jake.

08:17.731 --> 08:22.035
[overlapping chatter]
- Below Jake.

08:22.068 --> 08:25.805
And when did things start
with Below Jake?

08:25.839 --> 08:29.542
- Um, not till after
we finished filming.

08:29.576 --> 08:32.812
- So was part of the reason
that you were cool

08:32.846 --> 08:35.882
on young David here

08:35.915 --> 08:40.653
because you saw Below Jake
fishing around below deck,

08:40.687 --> 08:46.059
and you thought, well, this is
the actual money on the boat?

08:46.059 --> 08:48.962
- No, actually,
Jake's super introverted,

08:49.062 --> 08:51.898
so I really didn't talk to him
till the end of the season.

08:51.931 --> 08:53.867
So at that time
Jake wasn't even--

08:53.900 --> 08:55.602
he was very
behind the scenes.

08:55.635 --> 08:57.604
- Yeah, she didn't
even notice him.

08:57.637 --> 09:00.707
- Jake is
our second engineer.

09:00.740 --> 09:03.710
[laughter]

09:03.743 --> 09:05.845
- Sandy, what was your reaction
when you found out

09:05.879 --> 09:09.015
Malia and Jake
were a thing?

09:09.049 --> 09:11.584
- That's Malia's business
and Jake's.

09:11.618 --> 09:14.254
Like, it's none of my business.
I mean, she's an adult--

09:14.287 --> 09:16.022
- Surprised
I'm not a lesbian.

09:16.022 --> 09:17.590
- That's funny.

09:17.624 --> 09:19.693
- Yeah, that's
a Cameo thing only.

09:19.726 --> 09:22.328
- Oh.
[laughter]

09:22.362 --> 09:24.597
Well, what about that?
I mean, that was--

09:24.631 --> 09:26.433
that was kind of
a wild little thing.

09:26.466 --> 09:27.767
I mean, it happened
off camera,

09:27.801 --> 09:30.303
but there was a moment
where, Sandy,

09:30.337 --> 09:34.441
you kind of were speculating
about Malia on a Cameo,

09:34.474 --> 09:36.042
and it blew up online.

09:36.042 --> 09:38.645
That happened right before
you guys, I think,

09:38.678 --> 09:39.779
were getting on boat.

09:39.813 --> 09:43.883
That had to be unusual,
awkward, odd.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.086
You two, I'm assuming
had to work it out

09:46.119 --> 09:47.954
before you started.
- Yeah.

09:48.054 --> 09:50.490
Like, obviously, Malia's--
- We did.

09:50.523 --> 09:54.327
- Shared things, yeah,
but that was edited,

09:54.361 --> 09:56.696
taken out of context,
and as you know,

09:56.730 --> 10:00.266
people can really spin things.
So Malia and I are fine.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.769
- Malia, when you
came on the boat

10:02.802 --> 10:07.540
and that was all blowing up,
was that odd, awkward?

10:07.574 --> 10:09.609
- No, it really wasn't.

10:09.642 --> 10:11.578
I mean, I don't really care
if people think I'm a lesbian

10:11.611 --> 10:16.483
or if I'm straight.
I'll have fun either way.

10:16.516 --> 10:19.486
- Very good.
- It's a good Cameo.

10:19.519 --> 10:20.587
- All right,
we're gonna be back

10:20.620 --> 10:22.689
with the crew from Lady Michelle
after this.

10:22.722 --> 10:24.190
- Perfect, I'm gonna
open my wine.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.960
- What kind?
- Rose all day.

10:26.993 --> 10:28.895
- Up next...

10:28.928 --> 10:30.563
- When I watched the show,
I'm just--

10:30.597 --> 10:32.399
I was actually
mortified.

10:32.432 --> 10:34.267
- ...judging me.
I work year round.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.735
- Well, she's judging you
on what you said

10:35.769 --> 10:37.237
and how you behaved.
- She's a big phony, Andy.

10:47.213 --> 10:48.014
- Welcome back
to the "Below Deck Med"

10:48.848 --> 10:50.183
season six reunion.

10:50.216 --> 10:53.520
I'm Andy Cohen here with
the crew from Lady Michelle:

10:53.553 --> 10:56.623
Captain Sandy, Katie,
Malia, Chef Mat,

10:56.656 --> 10:59.793
David, Lloyd, Zee,
and Courtney.

10:59.826 --> 11:04.097
As a luxury yacht chef,
Mathew's very good

11:04.130 --> 11:05.732
at stirring
and simmering,

11:05.765 --> 11:07.867
but it didn't take the crew
long to realize

11:07.901 --> 11:11.705
he's also an expert
at spiraling.

11:11.738 --> 11:13.707
- I hurt my knee last night.
- Okay.

11:13.740 --> 11:15.608
- I don't feel like
I can do this properly.

11:15.642 --> 11:17.344
- Say that again?
- I don't feel like

11:17.377 --> 11:18.378
I can do this properly.

11:18.411 --> 11:19.846
- We're gonna get your MRI.

11:19.879 --> 11:21.381
- There will be...
- No chef?

11:21.414 --> 11:22.415
- no chef?
- Sorry.

11:22.449 --> 11:24.651
- I'm pretty sure
the blade's meant to go--

11:24.684 --> 11:26.252
- How do you kindly
kill a lobster?

11:26.286 --> 11:28.088
- What is that?
- I don't know.

11:28.088 --> 11:29.522
Poisonous, probably.

11:29.556 --> 11:31.257
- I think we should try
to cook one of those.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.360
This is not okay.
- What's happening

11:33.393 --> 11:35.795
in the galley right now
is a disaster.

11:35.829 --> 11:38.965
- That was terrible steak.

11:38.998 --> 11:42.469
Not good.
Grilled oysters-- not okay.

11:42.502 --> 11:44.938
- All crew, all crew.
Our chef is returning.

11:44.971 --> 11:46.539
- How are you? How is
your knee? What happened?

11:46.573 --> 11:47.941
- It wasn't
anything serious.

11:47.974 --> 11:50.810
I have this deep
anxiety inside of me

11:50.844 --> 11:52.812
before that first meal
for a new guest,

11:52.846 --> 11:56.649
and instead of just getting over
that and doing it, I bailed.

11:56.683 --> 11:59.119
I couldn't perform well
at my first sex party.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.820
- Nobody can.
- I went in, and I was like,

12:00.854 --> 12:02.756
yeah, I'm ready.
- Mat, shut the (BLEEP) up!

12:02.789 --> 12:04.858
- Don't say that!

12:04.891 --> 12:06.659
- Give me crap
about bein' myself?

12:06.693 --> 12:08.061
It's like, (BLEEP) you.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.662
I'm goin' home.
- Mat, no.

12:09.696 --> 12:11.698
- Yeah, you have a spare bag?
I'm goin' home.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.167
I'm done. They can find some
(BLEEP) to be their chef.

12:14.200 --> 12:19.172
- The chef?
He left? Why?

12:19.205 --> 12:21.141
- I need--
I need to come back.

12:21.174 --> 12:24.144
- Well, I got a chef.
- And this next charter

12:24.177 --> 12:25.945
will be it for me?
- Yes.

12:25.979 --> 12:27.614
- Yep.
- Mathew has not had

12:27.647 --> 12:28.848
any complaints
about the food.

12:28.882 --> 12:31.217
Mathew's problem
is Mathew.

12:31.251 --> 12:34.354
I'm gonna trust you
to finish the season out.

12:34.387 --> 12:36.423
- That means a lot.

12:36.456 --> 12:39.125
- Okay, so, Matthew,
a lot of questions for you.

12:39.159 --> 12:41.728
Roger B. said you mentioned
having left other jobs

12:41.761 --> 12:44.464
in the past due to pressure.
- Yeah.

12:44.497 --> 12:47.667
- Did those jobs
allow you to return?

12:47.701 --> 12:49.936
- Um, no, I didn't return.

12:49.969 --> 12:52.605
Two of them were just,
like, one-off dinner parties,

12:52.639 --> 12:55.608
where I took on
more than I could handle

12:55.642 --> 12:58.111
as far as menu,
and I, you know,

12:58.144 --> 12:59.746
stressed myself out
and backed out,

12:59.779 --> 13:00.647
and I regret it.

13:00.680 --> 13:02.482
It was, you know,
a horrible time.

13:02.515 --> 13:03.850
- Was there extra
pressure this time

13:03.883 --> 13:05.618
knowing you had
the entire crew

13:05.652 --> 13:08.922
kind of counting on you?

13:08.955 --> 13:11.057
- Yeah, of course. Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.592
- I didn't feel good
about this situation.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.828
- Um--
- I was having a panic attack.

13:14.861 --> 13:17.197
- I'm wondering.
Did the rest of you

13:17.230 --> 13:20.400
think Chef Mathew
would be coming back?

13:20.433 --> 13:22.068
- I didn't think
I was going to.

13:22.068 --> 13:23.603
- Lloyd thought
he was coming back.

13:23.636 --> 13:26.773
Sandy, what did you think?
- I had no idea.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.242
I honestly--
I was hoping he would,

13:29.275 --> 13:31.745
but I-I didn't know.

13:31.778 --> 13:33.880
- Sandy, how did
everybody do

13:33.913 --> 13:36.282
pitching in
while he was gone?

13:36.316 --> 13:38.585
- [laughing]
Amazing. David--

13:38.618 --> 13:41.554
David, Courtney
jumped in.

13:41.588 --> 13:44.524
I mean, honestly, it was--
I called my brother-in-law.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.726
"How do you do oysters?"
It was like--

13:46.760 --> 13:48.628
I didn't even ask.
They jumped in.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.897
- There's no way
I could do that.

13:50.930 --> 13:53.466
- Oh! Savage!

13:53.500 --> 13:55.001
- Oh, my God.
Was he alive?

13:55.101 --> 13:56.870
[indistinct]

13:56.903 --> 13:59.139
- Oh, my God, they're popping
open! I'm so happy!

13:59.172 --> 14:00.740
- Oh, the aphrodisiac.

14:00.774 --> 14:02.709
- Looking back on it,

14:02.742 --> 14:06.146
maybe the knee was,
like, an excuse to get--

14:06.179 --> 14:07.881
remove myself
from that situation.

14:07.914 --> 14:09.883
I never had cameras
in my face before.

14:09.916 --> 14:11.117
It was all
very overwhelming.

14:11.151 --> 14:14.521
So obviously, there wasn't
a knee problem,

14:14.554 --> 14:15.722
because I got an MRI.
- Did you not feel like you--

14:15.755 --> 14:19.292
you were returning to an even
more stressful situation

14:19.325 --> 14:22.062
than you had left?
- Yeah. Yeah, I ----ed myself.

14:22.062 --> 14:24.531
Yeah, I didn't--
It wasn't a plan, you know?

14:24.564 --> 14:26.933
- Clearly.
- Yeah.

14:26.966 --> 14:29.836
- Captain Sandy, Wendy R. said,
"I understand you wanting

14:29.869 --> 14:33.206
"to give Matt another shot
after his 'knee injury,'

14:33.239 --> 14:35.108
"but it was really hard
to watch you let him

14:35.141 --> 14:36.910
"return to the boat
yet again

14:36.943 --> 14:40.113
"after his drunken departure
in the middle of the night.

14:40.146 --> 14:41.715
Why keep him..."
- That's not fair.

14:41.748 --> 14:43.683
- "After two strikes
when there was another chef

14:43.717 --> 14:44.951
waiting in the wings?"

14:44.984 --> 14:46.486
-It's a big job
being a chef.

14:46.519 --> 14:47.887
I'm not making
excuses for him,

14:47.921 --> 14:50.657
but I had to make
a decision.

14:50.690 --> 14:53.526
It's better to go with who
I know than who I don't know.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.363
- And by the way,
how did Matt's food

14:56.396 --> 14:58.431
compare to other chefs
you've worked with,

14:58.465 --> 15:00.600
Katie and Sandy?

15:00.633 --> 15:02.402
- He never--
no one ever complained.

15:02.435 --> 15:05.038
- It was just consistently good.
Yeah, it was always--

15:05.038 --> 15:07.707
the way it tasted.
It always came out hot.

15:07.741 --> 15:10.076
There was never a complaint
about a meal being too cold,

15:10.110 --> 15:12.045
which is probably one of
the most common complaints,

15:12.078 --> 15:15.181
um, on a yacht or probably
any service industry.

15:15.215 --> 15:17.817
So it really blew me away.

15:17.851 --> 15:20.453
- Char M. wants to know
if you guys would

15:20.487 --> 15:23.823
ever want to work with
Chef Mathew again.

15:23.857 --> 15:26.159
She says,
"Besides believing

15:26.192 --> 15:28.061
"he's the most important
person on the ship,

15:28.094 --> 15:30.130
"he seemed to not be
professional

15:30.163 --> 15:31.531
by walking off
as often--"

15:31.564 --> 15:33.500
So everybody's
raising their hands.

15:33.533 --> 15:35.068
Everybody would work
with him again.

15:35.068 --> 15:37.337
Sandy is not
raising her hand.

15:37.370 --> 15:40.707
- I like reliability
and dependability.

15:40.740 --> 15:44.077
Matthew's a great guy,
but I just--

15:44.077 --> 15:45.812
and after watching the show--
- She's judging me

15:45.845 --> 15:48.081
on two days in my life.
- After watching the show,

15:48.081 --> 15:52.185
People who poke the bear--
it's-it's a little hard.

15:52.218 --> 15:54.654
So, um, with everything
that happened--

15:54.688 --> 15:56.222
you know, I don't
see everything.

15:56.256 --> 15:58.591
So when I watch the show,
I'm just--

15:58.625 --> 16:00.260
I was actually mortified.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.062
- Why are you judging me?
I work year round.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.630
- Well, she's judging you
on what you said

16:03.663 --> 16:05.031
and how you behaved.
- She's a big phony, Andy.

16:05.031 --> 16:07.367
- That's why.
There's your answer.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.337
- It's hard to put words
back in your mouth though, Mat.

16:10.370 --> 16:12.138
I mean, she said
she's judging you

16:12.172 --> 16:14.374
based on things she
saw you do and say.

16:14.407 --> 16:16.242
- Yeah, but-- I know, but--
yeah, whatever.

16:16.276 --> 16:18.244
- An editor can't
create those things.

16:18.278 --> 16:22.082
Do you think they made you look
worse than you were as a chef?

16:22.115 --> 16:25.051
- I mean, like,
I did everything I did.

16:25.085 --> 16:27.253
I regret the bad
moments I have,

16:27.287 --> 16:29.923
but I think
I'm-I'm a good employee,

16:29.956 --> 16:32.192
and I think Sandy's
one of the worst captains

16:32.225 --> 16:34.527
I've ever worked with
in my 15 years on boats.

16:34.561 --> 16:36.296
- Okay, like, wait.
I think that's a bit--

16:36.329 --> 16:38.665
slightly too far, Mathew.
Like, I think--

16:38.698 --> 16:41.067
what the problem is-
- Well, that was the truth.

16:41.101 --> 16:43.269
- No, I think the issue was,
like, obviously Captain Sandy's

16:43.303 --> 16:45.105
now seeing everything that
happened on the nights out

16:45.138 --> 16:47.574
and stuff, and, like,
for unreliability,

16:47.607 --> 16:49.642
I understand from a captain's
point of it--

16:49.676 --> 16:51.878
point of view, like,
it's hard to employee somebody

16:51.911 --> 16:54.414
when they're, like,
unreliable and, like, they quit.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.850
That's all-- like, that-that's
the in-in that--

16:56.883 --> 16:58.885
in that respect, I agree.
Like, it-it-it's hard--

16:58.918 --> 17:00.186
it must be hard
for her to think

17:00.220 --> 17:02.322
that she would employ you again
if you're gonna quit.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.724
- And you're not always
gonna see eye-to-eye.

17:04.758 --> 17:06.326
- Yeah. Yeah, you're not always
gonna see eye-to-eye.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.561
- You can be
really great at your job,

17:08.595 --> 17:11.865
but there's another side
that comes to our job,

17:11.898 --> 17:13.566
and that's personality.

17:13.600 --> 17:17.270
We have to be able
to defuse things

17:17.303 --> 17:18.938
because we live
and work together,

17:19.039 --> 17:21.307
and it's-it's not easy
all the time.

17:21.341 --> 17:23.710
And then you add alcohol,
and people do and say things

17:23.743 --> 17:25.478
that they don't mean
and they regret,

17:25.512 --> 17:27.881
and, you know,
when I watched the show,

17:27.914 --> 17:30.050
I was just like,
"Oh, my God." Like--

17:30.083 --> 17:31.418
- Yeah, how do you
think I felt?

17:31.451 --> 17:33.153
- You know, I think
it's hard when people--

17:33.186 --> 17:35.422
if you do a constructive
criticism,

17:35.455 --> 17:37.657
some people can't take that,
and you--

17:37.691 --> 17:39.926
you just don't know
when to not talk,

17:39.959 --> 17:41.561
and that-that's
your Achilles heel

17:41.594 --> 17:43.063
is your own self.

17:43.096 --> 17:46.232
- Okay.
- Up next..

17:46.266 --> 17:48.768
r behavior
in general was quite sh--.
is your own self.

17:48.802 --> 17:50.937
- If anything, she was
edited nicely that night.

17:50.970 --> 17:52.806
She was much worse.

17:52.839 --> 17:54.207
- Production actually
stepped in

18:05.585 --> 18:06.252
- One of Lexi's
go-to insults

18:07.520 --> 18:09.122
was to remind everyone

18:09.155 --> 18:11.725
she had more money
in her bank account.

18:11.758 --> 18:14.361
But during one fateful
hot tub night on deck,

18:14.394 --> 18:16.863
her antics left
the crew's patience

18:16.896 --> 18:20.066
totally overdrawn.
Watch.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.276
- Why does she always
talk about money?

18:30.310 --> 18:34.080
She's like, "You're so poor!
You're so poor!"

18:44.524 --> 18:46.059
- I'm ----ing being
inappropriate?

18:46.092 --> 18:48.061
But I feel as if you're
being inappropriate,

18:48.094 --> 18:49.129
so (BLEEP) you.

18:49.162 --> 18:50.530
- I'm not the one that was
offended like you!

18:50.563 --> 18:51.931
- Shut up!
- Oh, you kiss ass!

18:51.965 --> 18:53.433
- Me?
- And you're fake as (BLEEP).

18:53.466 --> 18:56.236
You're a ----ing Bosun!
Stand the (BLEEP) down!

18:56.269 --> 18:58.972
David, you're so whack.
- Aren't you like unemployable?

18:59.072 --> 19:01.341
- No, I'm employable 'cause
I have more money than you.

19:01.374 --> 19:04.244
- You're talking sh--.
- Lexi? Lexi?

19:04.277 --> 19:06.246
- Katie, you're a Capricorn, and
you can feel what I'm feeling.

19:06.279 --> 19:08.248
(BLEEP) her being a kiss ass!
(BLEEP) off!

19:08.281 --> 19:09.649
- Hey!
[screaming]

19:09.683 --> 19:12.352
- You made some really personal
inappropriate comments,

19:12.385 --> 19:13.620
and not just to me.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.088
You owe an apology
to Zee as well.

19:15.121 --> 19:17.424
- Yes, I apologize,
Katie and David,

19:17.457 --> 19:19.759
for my stuff last night.

19:19.793 --> 19:22.929
- I feel like you guys
can figure this out.

19:23.029 --> 19:25.065
- I'm pissed off
with you again

19:25.098 --> 19:27.600
because it doesn't feel
like you want to be here.

19:27.634 --> 19:30.036
It doesn't feel
like you care, really.

19:30.070 --> 19:32.439
- No, I don't care.
I'm leaving.

19:32.472 --> 19:35.608
- Maybe this isn't
the right environment for her.

19:35.642 --> 19:38.778
- I'm just gonna ask you
to give her another chance.

19:38.812 --> 19:42.482
You're a leader.
Rise. Go lead.

19:42.515 --> 19:45.051
[nervous chuckling]

19:45.051 --> 19:46.853
- Okay, I-I will say--

19:46.886 --> 19:48.788
So I want to start
with you, Sandy.

19:48.822 --> 19:50.623
I'm mean, you're-you're
watching yourself say,

19:50.657 --> 19:52.826
"You can figure this out.
Give it another chance."

19:52.859 --> 19:55.595
Now you're seeing the show,
and you're seeing footage

19:55.628 --> 19:58.365
that you hadn't seen before.

19:58.398 --> 20:00.834
What would you
have done differently,

20:00.867 --> 20:03.103
or would you have done
anything differently?

20:03.136 --> 20:05.138
- The reality is,
I don't see everything.

20:05.171 --> 20:06.773
I never heard specifics,

20:06.806 --> 20:08.641
so if someone
comes up to you and says,

20:08.675 --> 20:10.243
"It was bad.
It was real bad."

20:10.276 --> 20:12.545
Do you base firing someone
off of that?

20:12.579 --> 20:15.382
I didn't see
Lexi's behavior.

20:15.415 --> 20:16.983
So if I would have seen it,

20:17.017 --> 20:19.986
um, I would have fired her
immediately.

20:20.020 --> 20:23.223
- So, Zee, then what was going
through your mind

20:23.256 --> 20:25.525
when she pushed you
in the crew mess?

20:25.558 --> 20:26.860
- You know, I'm gonna
step in here.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.262
Production actually
stepped in and--

20:29.295 --> 20:32.599
- They-they did?
- Yeah, because it was

20:32.632 --> 20:34.401
getting so out of hand.
- Yeah. They did. They did.

20:34.434 --> 20:36.569
- They actually stepped in
and like, lost our sh--,

20:36.603 --> 20:38.271
and was like, "This is not
what we're about,"

20:38.304 --> 20:39.839
and if it goes any further,
I'm pretty sure

20:39.873 --> 20:42.008
Lexi would have been
removed straight away.

20:42.042 --> 20:45.378
Um, but I guess
she reigned it in at that point.

20:45.412 --> 20:48.281
- If anything, she was edited
nicely that night.

20:48.314 --> 20:49.883
- I think so, too.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.652
- She was much worse.
- I completely understand

20:52.686 --> 20:54.554
that grief is, like,
such a horrible thing,

20:54.587 --> 20:57.891
and, like, you-you know,
everyone, uh, deals with it

20:57.924 --> 20:59.793
in a different way, and I
completely understand that,

20:59.826 --> 21:03.196
but at no point do I think that
it means that you should be,

21:03.229 --> 21:05.899
um, that offensive
to another person

21:05.932 --> 21:08.234
and that aggressive
to another person.

21:08.268 --> 21:11.271
And I feel like, yeah,
that-- to-to me,

21:11.304 --> 21:12.605
that just-- it's not--
it's not--

21:12.639 --> 21:14.174
it's not really an excuse.

21:14.207 --> 21:16.176
- Courtney, knowing
that your dad

21:16.209 --> 21:18.211
is-is going through it
right now,

21:18.244 --> 21:20.513
and that you are,
uh, with him,

21:20.547 --> 21:22.248
could you empathize

21:22.282 --> 21:25.185
with Lexi's state
of mind at all?

21:25.218 --> 21:29.255
- Uh, no. I'm-- I--
My dad's now in a home.

21:29.289 --> 21:32.659
And I-- he doesn't
remember who I am.

21:32.692 --> 21:34.294
And I still would never
act that way

21:34.327 --> 21:36.296
against another
person ever.

21:36.329 --> 21:39.599
- I am really sorry to hear
about your dad, Courtney.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.601
- We're all there for you.
You know that.

21:41.634 --> 21:45.238
- It was hard, because I was
concerned about Lexi.

21:45.271 --> 21:47.707
I actually pulled her aside
and spoke to her and said,

21:47.741 --> 21:49.309
"Do you think this
is the environment

21:49.342 --> 21:51.711
"you should be in?
Because I as your Chief Stew

21:51.745 --> 21:53.380
"do not think you should
be here right now

21:53.413 --> 21:56.116
"because mentally,
you're going through a lot,

21:56.116 --> 21:58.351
"and it-- I don't know
if this is how you deal

21:58.385 --> 22:01.054
"with grief, you know,
but I don't think

22:01.054 --> 22:03.189
this is the best environment
for you right now."

22:03.223 --> 22:05.759
- Wow. All right.
We gotta move on.

22:05.792 --> 22:09.195
Chef Mat and Lexi
had their first dustup

22:09.229 --> 22:11.297
over a dirt pile.

22:11.331 --> 22:13.500
But as the charter season
went on,

22:13.533 --> 22:16.536
these two Yachties
couldn't stop slinging mud

22:16.569 --> 22:18.471
in each other's direction.

22:18.505 --> 22:19.606
Take a look.

22:19.639 --> 22:21.408
- Can you please not step
in that? I just swept it.

22:21.441 --> 22:23.109
- I will sweep it up.

22:23.143 --> 22:25.278
Just focus on putting
the lamb on the plate.

22:25.311 --> 22:26.813
- You can't talk to me
like you're the boss.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.615
I'm in charge of the galley,
all right? Never again.

22:28.648 --> 22:30.517
I've never disliked someone
more in my life.

22:30.550 --> 22:32.686
- You're a nobody.
You're a low life.

22:43.363 --> 22:44.431
- She had bad parents.

22:44.464 --> 22:45.265
- Your parents should have
----ing aborted you.

22:45.298 --> 22:46.866
- Ohh.
- Yeah, and if this wasn't

22:46.900 --> 22:48.601
on camera, I woulda
smacked your ass.

22:48.635 --> 22:51.705
- I'm just gonna tell Sandy
it's either me or her tomorrow.

22:51.738 --> 22:53.707
- Who started it?
- Mathew.

22:53.740 --> 22:55.709
He says stuff
to get under my skin.

22:55.742 --> 22:58.111
- She told me I should have been
aborted multiple times.

22:58.144 --> 22:59.245
- If Mathew says
something to you,

22:59.279 --> 23:01.781
your reaction, Lexi, goes
to a whole 'nother level.

23:01.815 --> 23:04.184
- What I'm hearing
is that you are difficult

23:04.217 --> 23:07.487
to live with.
- Well, he said last night

23:07.520 --> 23:09.089
that he's gonna give you
an ultimatum--

23:09.122 --> 23:11.358
either him or me.
- If you give me an ultimatum,

23:11.391 --> 23:13.093
you can walk--
pack your ----ing sh--

23:13.126 --> 23:15.128
and walk off the boat.
That's how a I feel.

23:15.161 --> 23:17.964
The many
outweigh the one.

23:18.064 --> 23:21.167
And I-I have to make
a hard decision.

23:21.201 --> 23:22.736
I have to let you go.

23:22.769 --> 23:24.471
Lexi crossed the line,

23:24.504 --> 23:25.772
and if I have one person

23:25.805 --> 23:28.675
that's disturbing
the entire crew,

23:28.708 --> 23:30.076
I need to let go
of that person.

23:30.110 --> 23:32.278
- You are replaceable.

23:32.312 --> 23:34.080
There's someone sitting
in quarantine right now

23:34.114 --> 23:36.516
to take your job.

23:36.549 --> 23:39.919
- Lex, need a hand?

23:39.953 --> 23:42.455
- Mat, Kelly from
North Carolina said,

23:42.489 --> 23:44.090
"After looking back
at the season,

23:44.090 --> 23:45.525
"did Chef Mathew realize

23:45.558 --> 23:47.627
"he's just as much
as fault--

23:47.660 --> 23:49.929
"at fault
as Lexi was?

23:49.963 --> 23:51.931
"She's not perfect,
but you were clearly trying

23:51.965 --> 23:53.767
"to get a reaction from her."

23:53.800 --> 23:55.568
- Yeah, I mean,
there was so much--

23:55.602 --> 23:57.604
I-I blame it on
the alcohol involved.

23:57.637 --> 23:59.139
The tour guide was
feeding us alcohol.

23:59.172 --> 24:01.041
It was a-- yeah.

24:01.041 --> 24:02.909
I'm not proud
of that fight with her

24:02.942 --> 24:04.644
and ruining everyone's
day off.

24:04.678 --> 24:07.447
And, like, we had
a challenging relationship

24:07.480 --> 24:08.948
on the boat
working together,

24:09.049 --> 24:10.617
but I don't want
to say anything

24:10.650 --> 24:13.520
about someone who's not here
to defend themselves.

24:13.553 --> 24:16.222
- Jordy N. texted
for everybody,

24:16.256 --> 24:18.324
"Why did most of the crew
continue to defend

24:18.358 --> 24:21.061
"Mathew over Lexi,
especially considering

24:21.061 --> 24:23.697
"he said some pretty terrible
things as well?"

24:23.730 --> 24:25.632
Anyone want to take this?

24:25.665 --> 24:27.500
- So I feel like
we were pretty stern

24:27.534 --> 24:30.236
with both of them about
how-how the situation was,

24:30.270 --> 24:33.406
but Mathew was
very good at his job.

24:33.440 --> 24:37.077
He actually apologized to all
of the crew very sincerely,

24:37.077 --> 24:40.347
whereas Lexi didn't actually
apologize to anybody sincerely.

24:40.380 --> 24:41.748
Me and Lexi were
literally friends

24:41.781 --> 24:43.183
at the start of the season.

24:43.216 --> 24:45.085
Like, we were friends.

24:45.118 --> 24:48.421
- We all got along.
Our first charter was great.

24:48.455 --> 24:49.756
- We all got along.
It was just the fact

24:49.789 --> 24:51.091
that what happened
after that

24:51.091 --> 24:54.928
was like a roller coaster
of sh--.

24:54.961 --> 24:56.262
- I'm curious what you think.

24:56.296 --> 25:00.133
Lexi on social media
has really been, um,

25:00.166 --> 25:02.869
blaming a lot of people.

25:02.902 --> 25:04.471
She's been blaming
production.

25:04.504 --> 25:07.540
She says she's been given
a very bad edit.

25:07.574 --> 25:10.577
She thinks she's been edited
very unfairly.

25:10.610 --> 25:13.046
- That's pretty classic of
anyone throughout the seasons

25:13.046 --> 25:14.914
who's come on "Below Deck"

25:14.948 --> 25:17.951
and not liked the way that
they've behaved when drunk.

25:18.051 --> 25:20.820
You know, it's pretty nasty
when you watch yourself back

25:20.854 --> 25:23.156
and you see all the regrets
and mistakes you've made.

25:23.189 --> 25:25.925
It's not the edit.
It's you.

25:25.959 --> 25:28.528
- Lloyd, what do you think?

25:28.561 --> 25:30.096
- We-we all gave her
a second chance.

25:30.130 --> 25:32.599
I went in there with
a fresh, uh, face.

25:32.632 --> 25:33.667
So did the other deck boys

25:33.700 --> 25:35.802
when we spent that time
in the hot tub.

25:35.835 --> 25:37.404
Um, and as far
as we were concerned,

25:37.437 --> 25:39.406
we were gonna try and get on
with the rest of the season.

25:39.439 --> 25:40.840
And then she-she went

25:40.874 --> 25:43.476
off the-
off the rails again.

25:43.510 --> 25:45.345
Uh, and-and enough
is enough.

25:45.378 --> 25:48.081
- Zee, did she get
a bad edit?

25:48.081 --> 25:49.549
- Um, no, honestly,
I do not believe

25:49.582 --> 25:51.518
Lexi got an unfair edit.

25:51.551 --> 25:54.220
Like, I know she recorded
a whole bunch of things

25:54.254 --> 25:56.556
on Instagram
which are not fair

25:56.589 --> 25:59.693
in terms of production
and in terms of myself.

25:59.726 --> 26:01.895
She didn't get an unfair edit,
I don't think.

26:01.928 --> 26:03.329
- What has she
shared about you

26:03.363 --> 26:06.232
that-that you've
taken issue with?

26:06.266 --> 26:08.201
- I mean, apparently, I-

26:08.234 --> 26:10.303
apparently I want
to be white,

26:10.337 --> 26:13.940
and that I don't-
I don't support Black people.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.942
That's really not something
that I believe at all,

26:16.042 --> 26:19.245
only because I advocate
for Black empowerment

26:19.279 --> 26:21.581
and Black people
doing great things,

26:21.614 --> 26:23.583
so just generally,

26:23.616 --> 26:26.252
her behavior in general
was honestly quite sh--.

26:26.286 --> 26:27.754
You don't treat
people that you care about

26:27.787 --> 26:29.856
or you don't treat
people like that.

26:29.889 --> 26:32.292
- Wow. Up next...

26:32.325 --> 26:34.327
- From the get-go,
it wasn't--

26:34.361 --> 26:35.929
It was a sh--show,
basically.

26:35.962 --> 26:38.732
I was so ----ing over
this sh--.

26:50.610 --> 26:51.344
Well, you've heard
of Chief Stews,

26:52.178 --> 26:53.513
but we're now being joined

26:53.546 --> 26:57.250
by Lady Michelle's
brief Stew, Delaney.

26:57.283 --> 27:00.320
Hi, Delaney.
- Hey, guys.

27:00.353 --> 27:03.823
- Uh, well, when Delaney
triggered a crew cabin swap

27:03.857 --> 27:07.794
that was a like a bad game
of crew-sical chairs,

27:07.827 --> 27:10.030
Katie ended her time
on board

27:10.063 --> 27:12.799
with an abrupt
record scratch.

27:12.832 --> 27:16.302
But did Delaney
face the music too soon?

27:16.336 --> 27:18.138
Watch this.

27:18.171 --> 27:20.306
- Hi! Katie.
- D-Delaney.

27:20.340 --> 27:22.042
So I've never been
a Stewardess before.

27:22.042 --> 27:24.144
Um, yeah.

27:24.177 --> 27:25.612
- Management
just called.

27:25.645 --> 27:28.948
We can not allow
cabin sharing

27:29.049 --> 27:31.051
between a male and a female.
- Okay.

27:31.051 --> 27:33.887
Every single crew member
is gonna have to shuffle cabins

27:33.920 --> 27:35.822
to make this work.

27:35.855 --> 27:37.791
- Yeah, let's do it.
I lost my cabin.

27:37.824 --> 27:40.060
- I'm just ----ing over
thinking about this.

27:40.060 --> 27:41.327
It's just causing
too much drama,

27:41.361 --> 27:43.063
and I feel so sick.

27:43.063 --> 27:44.197
- I actually got
another girl on,

27:44.230 --> 27:46.066
because Lexi couldn't
do her ----ing job,

27:46.066 --> 27:49.069
and now they're both doing
the same job together.

27:49.069 --> 27:50.337
- I'm just being lazy.
- I don't want

27:50.370 --> 27:52.739
that girl to be here.
- I know that.

27:52.772 --> 27:54.674
I feel terrible saying this,

27:54.708 --> 27:56.643
but I think
it would be best

27:56.676 --> 27:58.278
if you finish
this trip

27:58.311 --> 28:02.315
and we say goodbye.
- Do I think it's fair? No.

28:02.349 --> 28:05.352
- Can you get Lexi's luggage?
I just let her go.

28:05.385 --> 28:07.854
Considering Delaney
is still here,

28:07.887 --> 28:09.189
it's an option.

28:09.222 --> 28:11.891
She's not a Stew, but at least
you have another person.

28:11.925 --> 28:14.494
- I'd so much rather,
like, work harder

28:14.527 --> 28:15.762
and work longer

28:15.795 --> 28:17.897
than have
the emotional stress

28:17.931 --> 28:20.900
of bringing somebody new in
or bringing Delaney back.

28:20.934 --> 28:22.502
- It's around the clock
for deck crew.

28:22.535 --> 28:25.338
We're helping with laundry,
with service.

28:25.372 --> 28:28.208
It's been a lot.
- Hello?

28:28.241 --> 28:29.609
Sister Katie?

28:29.642 --> 28:31.611
- A guest in the hot tub
needs some drinks.

28:31.644 --> 28:34.047
- It's ----ing stupid, because,
like, a couple weeks ago,

28:34.047 --> 28:35.849
I'm complaining about
needing more Stews,

28:35.882 --> 28:38.518
and now I'm like,
"Hey, let's just fire two Stews

28:38.551 --> 28:39.419
"and just keep two."

28:39.452 --> 28:42.489
Like, what is wrong with me?

28:42.522 --> 28:43.590
- Krista L. wants to know

28:43.623 --> 28:45.825
your first impressions
of Delaney.

28:45.859 --> 28:48.862
Did you think she was gonna
fit in the group, Katie?

28:48.895 --> 28:50.764
- Um, well,
my first impression

28:50.797 --> 28:52.665
was finding out
she wasn't a Stew,

28:52.699 --> 28:54.501
so obviously,
from the get-go,

28:54.534 --> 28:58.905
it wasn't-- it was just--
it was a sh--show, basically.

28:58.938 --> 29:02.142
- Well, so talk to me about that
a little, Delaney.

29:02.175 --> 29:04.344
- Yeah, so I was
in quarantine for deck.

29:04.377 --> 29:07.080
Um, and then I found out
the need was for a Stew

29:07.113 --> 29:08.114
very last minute,

29:08.148 --> 29:09.716
so it was just as much
of a surprise to me

29:09.749 --> 29:11.317
as it was to Katie, I feel.

29:11.351 --> 29:14.020
- Matt, Carley E. said,
"With how many times

29:14.020 --> 29:16.823
"you walked out and quit, Mat,
why were you so forward

29:16.856 --> 29:19.592
"with your thoughts about
wanting Delaney off the boat?"

29:19.626 --> 29:21.227
- I only walked out
and quit once.

29:21.261 --> 29:23.863
The other one was the knee
injury/panic attack,

29:23.897 --> 29:26.066
so it was only one,
but, um,

29:26.099 --> 29:27.600
I burned my finger so bad.

29:27.634 --> 29:28.735
I was in a lot of pain.

29:28.768 --> 29:31.504
Martin's cabin was musty
and had no portholes.

29:31.538 --> 29:33.373
I just wanted
my bed back, you know?

29:33.406 --> 29:35.775
[laughter]

29:35.809 --> 29:37.143
I wanted my bed.

29:37.177 --> 29:40.347
- You know what though?
I actually did that.

29:40.380 --> 29:42.048
I said, "Can I share
a cabin with him?"

29:42.048 --> 29:44.150
Delaney was brought on
to try to help, like,

29:44.184 --> 29:45.719
figure this situation out,

29:45.752 --> 29:48.054
and it just ended up, like,
creating more drama

29:48.088 --> 29:49.389
and more stress,
so in my eyes,

29:49.422 --> 29:52.058
I was like, just can it.
Let's just, like, move on.

29:52.058 --> 29:54.794
I was so ----ing
over this sh--

29:54.828 --> 29:56.396
that I was dealing with
that season so--

29:56.429 --> 29:58.832
- She's also
not a Stew.

29:58.865 --> 30:01.501
- Do you regret
your decision, Katie?

30:01.534 --> 30:03.970
- I don't. I do
for the rest of the crew,

30:04.004 --> 30:06.806
and it wasn't-- like,
for deck crew, I do,

30:06.840 --> 30:09.042
but for everything else,
I don't.

30:09.075 --> 30:11.077
- Malia, do you wish--
given the-

30:11.111 --> 30:14.214
the pressure it put
on your team,

30:14.247 --> 30:17.317
do you wish that Katie could--
had kept her around?

30:17.350 --> 30:19.052
- You know, I-I think
having Delaney there

30:19.085 --> 30:20.754
would have been
super helpful, yes.

30:20.787 --> 30:21.721
And Delaney was.

30:21.755 --> 30:23.490
She was up for,
you know, helping out

30:23.523 --> 30:24.924
wherever she could,

30:24.958 --> 30:27.127
but I think Katie
made the decision

30:27.160 --> 30:28.595
that she thought
was best for the team,

30:28.628 --> 30:29.929
and I stand by that.

30:29.963 --> 30:31.898
- I-- what I needed
at the time--

30:31.931 --> 30:33.633
I needed a stewardess
with experience

30:33.667 --> 30:36.069
that could be thrown
straight in the deep end.

30:36.102 --> 30:38.705
Um, and Delaney
wasn't that.

30:38.738 --> 30:40.040
She's not a stewardess.

30:40.073 --> 30:42.075
She's never been
a super yacht stewardess.

30:42.108 --> 30:43.743
So it wasn't
what I needed.

30:43.777 --> 30:47.080
It wasn't Delaney.
It was not the right fit

30:47.113 --> 30:49.816
for what we were after
at that time.

30:49.849 --> 30:52.585
- Delaney, didn't you
think you would get busted?

30:52.619 --> 30:54.554
- Um, I didn't--
I did not lie on my CV.

30:54.587 --> 30:55.889
You guys are welcome
to call that captain

30:55.922 --> 30:57.724
that I did work for
for months

30:57.757 --> 30:59.492
on a small boat
in San Diego.

30:59.526 --> 31:01.061
Like, it--
none of it's a lie.

31:01.061 --> 31:02.896
It's just a small boat
Deck Stew position

31:02.929 --> 31:04.197
is not a super yacht.

31:04.230 --> 31:05.331
Frankly, I didn't really
want to be a Stew,

31:05.365 --> 31:07.534
but I rose to the occasion,
and I, you know,

31:07.567 --> 31:09.102
I did what
the opportunity was.

31:09.135 --> 31:12.772
- But a Deck Stew does
Stewardess things.

31:12.806 --> 31:14.074
I was a Deck Stew.

31:14.074 --> 31:14.974
- Yeah, and I could
make a bed,

31:15.075 --> 31:16.309
and I could do things.

31:16.343 --> 31:18.311
On smaller boats,
we don't have--

31:18.345 --> 31:19.713
- Yeah, no, I get that.
For sure.

31:19.746 --> 31:21.081
- Like, people aren't sleeping
in cabins for day charters.

31:21.081 --> 31:23.083
- Well, I just think, like,
think of it in Katie's position.

31:23.083 --> 31:24.851
She sees someone that
it says "Deck Stew,"

31:24.884 --> 31:26.619
and then we get her on,

31:26.653 --> 31:28.088
and we're like, "Hey, you're
gonna be a Stewardess."

31:28.121 --> 31:30.657
You know, then that
essentially is saying,

31:30.690 --> 31:32.258
you know, you're green.

31:32.292 --> 31:34.227
You're green in--
as a Stewardess.

31:34.260 --> 31:35.628
So that's not
very helpful.

31:35.662 --> 31:37.597
That means Katie's
gonna have to train her.

31:37.630 --> 31:39.165
And we're at the point
in the season

31:39.199 --> 31:40.834
where we don't have time
to train someone.

31:40.867 --> 31:44.771
- Well, Delaney,
so what's next for you?

31:44.804 --> 31:46.006
- Uh, I live
in Hawaii right now,

31:46.106 --> 31:47.374
and I work on
a day charter boat,

31:47.407 --> 31:49.676
and, um,
it's a lot of fun.

31:49.709 --> 31:50.910
- Sounds like everything
worked out

31:50.944 --> 31:53.179
just peachy for you.

31:53.213 --> 31:55.548
Okay, well, I'm about to say
goodbye to Delaney

31:55.582 --> 31:56.616
and also Lloyd.

31:56.649 --> 31:58.785
It sounds like you're
about to lose service

31:58.818 --> 31:59.886
on your ship,

31:59.919 --> 32:01.921
so I want to say goodbye
to you, uh,

32:01.955 --> 32:03.556
before you get
cut off.

32:03.590 --> 32:05.358
Is there any-anything
you want to say

32:05.392 --> 32:07.660
before we say
goodbye to you, Lloyd?

32:07.694 --> 32:08.795
- Um, I just want to say

32:08.828 --> 32:11.197
it's so good to be back with
the-the crew again.

32:11.231 --> 32:14.067
Uh, I mean,
we all keep in touch.

32:14.100 --> 32:17.303
Uh, it's nice to have you
all in one place

32:17.337 --> 32:19.739
rather than speaking
individually on the phone.

32:19.773 --> 32:23.677
[audio breaking up]

32:23.710 --> 32:25.478
- Aw, we're

32:25.512 --> 32:26.413
- Love you, Lloyd.

32:26.446 --> 32:28.481
- Love you, Lloyd!

32:28.515 --> 32:30.183
- We'll do another
group chat soon, Lloyd.

32:30.216 --> 32:31.985
- Bye, Lloyd.
- Hearts and lungs.

32:32.085 --> 32:35.588
- See you later,
and thank you, Delaney.

32:35.622 --> 32:36.790
- See you later.

32:36.823 --> 32:38.091
- It was very nice to meet
all you guys,

32:38.124 --> 32:39.793
and I wish you guys the best
in your careers and yachting,

32:39.826 --> 32:41.728
and hopefully see you
around sometime.

32:41.761 --> 32:42.729
- All right.
- You, too.

32:42.762 --> 32:43.697
- Thank you, Delaney.
Thank you.

32:43.730 --> 32:46.800
- Thanks, Delaney.
- You, too, Delaney.

32:46.833 --> 32:48.435
- Courtney's
pouring her wine.

32:48.468 --> 32:50.103
- They call her
Coco Loco.

32:50.103 --> 32:51.705
- We'll be back.

32:51.738 --> 32:52.706
Coming up...

32:52.739 --> 32:55.108
- She should have told me.
- Did you realize

32:55.108 --> 32:57.811
you were losing
Captain Sandy's trust?

33:08.088 --> 33:08.955
- In seasons past,
Captain Sandy and Malia

33:10.890 --> 33:12.325
never struggled
with keeping

33:12.359 --> 33:15.428
their professional
relationship afloat.

33:15.462 --> 33:18.164
But this season,
trust issues between the two

33:18.198 --> 33:21.735
caused their partnership
to rapidly take on water.

33:21.768 --> 33:24.537
Watch.

33:27.073 --> 33:28.308
- I just asked Dave,

33:28.341 --> 33:30.343
but that's looking
like he didn't.

33:37.684 --> 33:39.519
- I'm not stupid.
She's covering.

33:39.552 --> 33:41.921
But in no way does
Malia get to dictate

33:41.955 --> 33:44.424
what is told to me,
and what isn't told to me.

33:44.457 --> 33:45.959
I need the trust.

33:45.992 --> 33:48.361
- They weren't tight.
- No.

33:48.395 --> 33:50.196
- Is there a plastic bag?
- No.

33:50.230 --> 33:53.733
- That's planting a little
seed of doubt in my mind.

33:53.767 --> 33:55.902
[yelling]

33:55.935 --> 33:57.604
[gasping]
- Dave!

33:57.637 --> 33:59.406
Are you okay?
- No.

33:59.439 --> 34:01.207
I'll do the forward ones.
- Can you?

34:01.241 --> 34:02.776
- Yeah.
- I don't know that

34:02.809 --> 34:04.844
I can put you over,
knowing that you're injured.

34:04.878 --> 34:06.379
- Tell me why
you're limping.

34:06.413 --> 34:08.815
- I fell.

34:08.848 --> 34:10.684
- Why wasn't it
reported to me?

34:10.717 --> 34:13.186
You, I'm really
disappointed in.

34:13.219 --> 34:14.788
It's a ----ing incident.

34:14.821 --> 34:16.723
The fact that Malia
knew about his injury

34:16.756 --> 34:19.325
is not okay with me.
She broke my trust.

34:19.359 --> 34:20.794
No.
- I'm not a chief officer.

34:20.827 --> 34:21.928
- I don't give a (BLEEP)!

34:21.961 --> 34:24.164
You should have come to me
that he was hurt!

34:24.197 --> 34:25.932
- I didn't know it was that--
- Stop making excuses!

34:25.965 --> 34:27.334
I don't trust you!
I can't trust you.

34:27.367 --> 34:29.803
- Okay, okay.

34:30.603 --> 34:32.706
- Okay, uh.

34:32.739 --> 34:34.741
Sandy, Stacey K.
wants to know

34:34.774 --> 34:37.577
why you got so frustrated
when Malia didn't immediately

34:37.610 --> 34:42.115
throw her crew under
the bus about the jetski.

34:42.148 --> 34:43.483
- Because--
- Um, Stacey K. thinks

34:43.516 --> 34:44.884
that makes her
a good manager

34:44.918 --> 34:47.620
to wait and see,
and she thought

34:47.654 --> 34:49.989
that was out of
character for you.

34:50.090 --> 34:53.760
- Malia-- my expectation
for Malia is really high.

34:53.793 --> 34:56.996
I don't have that expectation
for the deckhands

34:57.097 --> 34:58.732
like I do for Malia.

34:58.765 --> 35:01.434
Um...

35:01.468 --> 35:02.936
she should
have told me.

35:03.036 --> 35:06.406
- Did you realize you were
losing Captain Sandy's trust?

35:06.439 --> 35:08.074
- Well, I just wanna
get one thing straight.

35:08.108 --> 35:10.276
I actually wasn't
covering for David.

35:10.310 --> 35:12.245
I hadn't spoken
to him yet.

35:12.278 --> 35:14.414
So I'm not about
to tell the Captain

35:14.447 --> 35:16.082
that David left
the plugs out

35:16.116 --> 35:18.351
if I don't know.
Like, if I--

35:18.385 --> 35:20.286
and to be-- you know,
Captain Sandy was only

35:20.320 --> 35:22.689
working with the information
that she had, and I was only

35:22.722 --> 35:24.924
working with
the information that I had,

35:24.958 --> 35:27.627
and a few minutes later,
it all got resolved,

35:27.660 --> 35:30.296
so I wasn't about to
throw him under the bus.

35:30.330 --> 35:31.931
- Did you realize
at that moment

35:31.965 --> 35:35.168
by not saying something,
you were leading her to believe

35:35.201 --> 35:37.504
you were covering
for someone,

35:37.537 --> 35:40.440
and thereby causing
a trust issue between

35:40.473 --> 35:42.509
the two of you?
- No, I didn't.

35:42.542 --> 35:45.211
And had I realized that,
it would, you know,

35:45.245 --> 35:48.448
come off as me being
untrusting, or, like,

35:48.481 --> 35:50.583
trying to lie or cover.
I would have just said

35:50.617 --> 35:53.853
"I don't know yet."
Like, "I don't know."

35:53.887 --> 35:56.322
- Sometimes when you get that
little mustard seed of doubt,

35:56.356 --> 35:57.991
you go, "Wow,
I never wanna doubt

35:58.091 --> 36:00.794
"that she will never
tell me the truth."

36:00.827 --> 36:01.861
And that happened
in that split second,

36:01.895 --> 36:04.197
but, you know, it's--
it was the end

36:04.230 --> 36:07.233
of the charter season,
we're all exhausted,

36:07.267 --> 36:09.536
um, and...

36:09.569 --> 36:12.072
you're an excellent
bosun, period.

36:12.105 --> 36:13.840
- Thank you.

36:13.873 --> 36:15.575
- Tanya V. said,
"Malia, what did you think

36:15.608 --> 36:18.411
"when Captain Sandy
asked to see David's injury?

36:18.445 --> 36:19.646
"And do you
have any regrets

36:19.679 --> 36:22.349
"about how you initially
handled the situation?"

36:24.784 --> 36:26.653
- I think Captain Sandy
has every right to ask

36:26.686 --> 36:28.421
about David's injury.
She's the Captain,

36:28.455 --> 36:30.056
and she should have
been informed.

36:30.090 --> 36:33.393
I regret that we didn't
think of-- to go to her sooner.

36:33.426 --> 36:36.596
You know, again, this was
just a miscommunication.

36:36.629 --> 36:38.365
Like, it happened on
a drunken night off,

36:38.398 --> 36:40.400
and by the time we saw
Captain Sandy again,

36:40.433 --> 36:41.668
it was two days later,

36:41.701 --> 36:43.903
and just an
unfortunate situation.

36:43.937 --> 36:46.573
- David, did you ever get
checked for a concussion

36:46.606 --> 36:49.142
or anything?
That fall was...

36:49.175 --> 36:50.777
wild!
[chuckling]

36:50.810 --> 36:53.313
- The-the impact
of the fall was--

36:53.346 --> 36:56.282
it was literally centered
to that point in my leg.

36:56.316 --> 36:57.250
[clearing throat]

36:57.283 --> 36:58.651
Like, I know when
you see the footage,

36:58.685 --> 36:59.719
it's a little bit--
you know,

36:59.753 --> 37:01.721
even from both angles,
it look like I've gone

37:01.755 --> 37:04.357
[indistinct].

37:04.391 --> 37:06.793
Like I said, I was hittin'
my head three times a day

37:06.826 --> 37:10.030
[indistinct].
Let alone everywhere else.

37:10.063 --> 37:13.400
- Hey, that fall was
----ing bad, mate.

37:13.433 --> 37:15.201
- Yeah, you're--
holy god, it looked--

37:15.235 --> 37:17.303
- Oh, it was painful to watch.
- Yeah, it was so-- yeah.

37:17.337 --> 37:18.738
- I just wanna
speak to that,

37:18.772 --> 37:20.573
because in the very
beginning of the season,

37:20.607 --> 37:23.610
I said if anyone gets injured,
it comes straight to the bridge.

37:23.643 --> 37:27.380
You know, yes,
I came down hard on Malia

37:27.414 --> 37:29.916
because I, again,
have this expectation.

37:29.949 --> 37:32.185
But the reality is,
is David should re--

37:32.218 --> 37:35.155
you know, reported his injury,
because here's why.

37:35.188 --> 37:37.424
I can't take people
to sea if they're injured.

37:37.457 --> 37:40.226
And I should have had him
medically looked after,

37:40.260 --> 37:43.063
and then have a--
a medical release on him,

37:43.063 --> 37:46.099
because the reality is,
we go to sea, what if he--

37:46.132 --> 37:49.069
did have a concussion,
or something like that?

37:49.102 --> 37:51.938
So in the future,
if you get hurt onboard,

37:51.971 --> 37:53.473
just really
report that,

37:53.506 --> 37:56.609
because we don't want
anyone to go to sea and--

37:56.643 --> 37:58.578
and then have more issues,

37:58.611 --> 38:01.014
where we can't get
them medical help.

38:01.047 --> 38:02.515
- Malia, were you
caught off guard

38:02.549 --> 38:06.119
by how pissed-off
Sandy got about this?

38:06.152 --> 38:07.654
- Yeah, I was.
I mean, obviously,

38:07.687 --> 38:10.590
I admire Captain Sandy
a lot, so to have her say

38:10.623 --> 38:13.259
that she doesn't trust me
was really hard.

38:13.293 --> 38:15.862
Um, but you know I also
think that when people

38:15.895 --> 38:18.031
see Captain Sandy and I
get in a disagreement,

38:18.031 --> 38:19.933
they think it's like,
the end of the world,

38:20.033 --> 38:21.601
but it's not.
These things happen,

38:21.634 --> 38:23.336
and we work through them,
where, you know,

38:23.370 --> 38:25.271
I'm training to
be an officer,

38:25.305 --> 38:29.042
and she's teaching me
how to be a better one, so...

38:29.075 --> 38:30.043
- Up next...

38:30.043 --> 38:32.245
You saw everyone naked?

38:32.278 --> 38:33.079
- Yeah.

38:33.113 --> 38:35.048
- We always see
everyone naked.

38:35.048 --> 38:37.517
- It was a big-- yeah,
a big cuddle puddle.

38:37.550 --> 38:38.551
- I saw Malia naked,
I saw Katie naked,

38:38.585 --> 38:41.054
I saw Matthew naked,
David naked.

38:52.098 --> 38:53.133
- We are back, and I have
a few more questions before

38:54.367 --> 38:58.538
we officially bring this
charter season to a close.

38:58.571 --> 39:01.574
So Sara from Philly said,
"Katie, I know you said

39:01.608 --> 39:04.544
"what happens in Split
stays in Split,

39:04.577 --> 39:06.413
"but come on,
give us some details

39:06.446 --> 39:08.014
"on what happened
during that trip

39:08.048 --> 39:09.282
"after the--"
[laughing]

39:09.315 --> 39:12.318
"after--" this was after
everything ended, right?

39:12.352 --> 39:13.820
- We had, honestly,
a good time.

39:13.853 --> 39:17.157
We partied a lot,
um, and we just enjoyed

39:17.190 --> 39:19.025
each other's
company again.

39:19.025 --> 39:21.761
- Mzi and Courtney,
Danielle from Pittsburgh said,

39:21.795 --> 39:24.597
"Mzi was hesitant when asked
about his relationship

39:24.631 --> 39:27.200
"with Courtney after
the trip to Split.

39:27.233 --> 39:31.905
"So 'fess up, did they--
did you guys hook up in Split?"

39:31.938 --> 39:33.239
[chuckling]
- No.

39:33.273 --> 39:34.641
- Um, no.

39:34.674 --> 39:36.242
Didn't hook up in Split.

39:36.276 --> 39:37.544
Didn't hook up in Split.
- Aww.

39:37.577 --> 39:39.546
I was kinda hoping...

39:39.579 --> 39:41.414
it all--
- I know.

39:41.448 --> 39:43.683
We're still just good friends.
- By the way, Courtney,

39:43.717 --> 39:45.452
where are you?

39:45.485 --> 39:46.720
- I'm in Europe.
[laughing]

39:46.753 --> 39:48.655
- You're in Europe?
I'm watching you

39:48.688 --> 39:51.057
slugging down the wine
and I'm just worried

39:51.057 --> 39:53.126
there's gonna be a shortage.
- Dirty water.

39:53.159 --> 39:54.661
- Uh, I-I--
[laughing]

39:54.694 --> 39:56.196
I want there to--
I want you to leave

39:56.229 --> 39:59.566
some booze for
the other people in Europe.

39:59.599 --> 40:01.534
- Honey, it's water.
- It--

40:01.568 --> 40:05.372
- Don't you worry, my friend.
[laughing]

40:05.405 --> 40:09.142
- What were you drinking before
that got you in this state?

40:09.175 --> 40:10.610
- Before.
- Oh-okay.

40:10.643 --> 40:12.412
- Before I was--
- Rose!

40:12.445 --> 40:14.147
- I was drinking Rose.
- Okay.

40:14.180 --> 40:17.650
- Yeah, we all know how Rose
plays out with this group.

40:17.684 --> 40:19.619
- Oh boy.
- Yo, swag nasty style.

40:19.652 --> 40:22.856
- Rose all day.
- Honey, yeah. I'm fine.

40:22.889 --> 40:25.525
- Oswald, Oswald.
- I'm literally just--

40:25.558 --> 40:27.660
- Courtney and Mzi
have left the group chat.

40:27.694 --> 40:30.030
- I'm just listening.
[laughing]

40:30.063 --> 40:31.931
I am literally just
listening here, like--

40:31.965 --> 40:34.100
so intrigued about
what everyone has to say.

40:34.134 --> 40:36.236
[laughing]
- Literally.

40:36.269 --> 40:39.272
- Mat, you've never
filtered yourself before.

40:39.305 --> 40:42.776
Why start now? Who--
who hooked up in Split?

40:42.809 --> 40:45.278
- Oh, I don't even remember.
But it was a good time.

40:45.311 --> 40:47.747
Malia took us to
the best bracelet shop.

40:47.781 --> 40:49.849
- You said it was
like a sex party,

40:49.883 --> 40:52.052
and now you're telling me
about a bracelet shop?

40:52.085 --> 40:54.988
You went--
- See, this is what I'm saying!

40:55.021 --> 40:57.357
[laughing]
[overlapping chatter]

40:57.390 --> 40:59.693
- I saw everyone naked.
I'm just saying that.

40:59.726 --> 41:01.561
- Yeah, we-- we all
hooked up in Split.

41:01.594 --> 41:03.096
- I didn't get laid.

41:03.129 --> 41:05.365
- You saw everyone naked?

41:05.398 --> 41:06.800
- Yeah.
- We all--

41:06.833 --> 41:09.536
we always see
everyone naked in--

41:09.569 --> 41:12.739
[chuckling]
- You always see everyone naked?

41:12.772 --> 41:13.840
- Yeah.
- It was a big-- yeah.

41:13.873 --> 41:15.842
A big cuddle puddle.
- I saw Malia naked,

41:15.875 --> 41:18.378
I saw Katie naked,
I saw Mathew naked,

41:18.411 --> 41:20.447
David naked--
- You saw me naked on the boat.

41:20.480 --> 41:22.682
Literally all the time.
[laughing]

41:22.716 --> 41:26.252
- Courtney, I want whatever
you're having right now.

41:26.286 --> 41:27.921
- I think I missed that night.

41:27.954 --> 41:31.091
- Andy, I'm [slurring]
water, I'm good.

41:31.091 --> 41:32.659
- Uh...
- All I'm saying is that,

41:32.692 --> 41:35.562
you know, what happens
in Split stays in Split.

41:35.595 --> 41:37.364
[laughing]
- Okay.

41:37.397 --> 41:40.266
Um, by the way,
who else was in the house

41:40.300 --> 41:42.669
besides the on-camera crew?

41:42.702 --> 41:44.904
- [indistinct] was there.
- Yeah, yeah.

41:44.938 --> 41:47.607
Yeah, Malia, who else
was in the house?

41:47.640 --> 41:48.808
[indistinct]?

41:48.842 --> 41:51.644
- Well, I mean, obviously
we needed an engineer there.

41:51.678 --> 41:54.514
- Ah, very good.
- Obviously.

41:54.547 --> 41:55.648
- Very good.

41:55.682 --> 41:58.018
So Malia, was that
when your relationship

41:58.118 --> 42:01.054
with the engineer
really took off?

42:01.054 --> 42:02.956
- Uh, yeah.

42:03.056 --> 42:04.224
- Very good.

42:04.257 --> 42:05.959
So are you all still
in touch,

42:06.059 --> 42:08.762
and, uh, and-and chatting?

42:08.795 --> 42:10.764
I mean, it seems like
a pretty harmonious group--

42:10.797 --> 42:13.600
- Everyday.
- --With the exception of-of--

42:13.633 --> 42:15.235
- Everyday.
- [indistinct] isn't here.

42:15.268 --> 42:17.604
Every-every day.

42:17.637 --> 42:18.672
- Everyday.
- Pretty much.

42:18.705 --> 42:19.706
- Yeah, we do still
chat everyday.

42:19.739 --> 42:21.074
Our group chat.

42:21.074 --> 42:24.077
- Our group chat is called
"Let's Get Back and Split It".

42:24.077 --> 42:27.881
[laughter]

42:27.914 --> 42:29.949
- (BLEEP).
- Split It.

42:29.983 --> 42:31.951
- Sandy, what are
your final thoughts

42:31.985 --> 42:34.154
about the season?

42:34.187 --> 42:35.488
- I'm really proud
of the crew

42:35.522 --> 42:37.891
that they stayed
within the quarantine,

42:37.924 --> 42:39.192
no one got sick,

42:39.225 --> 42:40.694
we made it through
the season,

42:40.727 --> 42:42.862
and for me,
that was a success,

42:42.896 --> 42:44.764
to be able to film
the show.

42:44.798 --> 42:46.733
- Well, I wanna thank
you all for being here,

42:46.766 --> 42:48.335
and I also wanna
point out

42:48.368 --> 42:50.637
that Malia did
this entire interview

42:50.670 --> 42:54.974
from the bathroom of
the boat that she is on.

42:55.008 --> 42:56.309
- On charter!

42:56.343 --> 42:57.811
- On charter.

42:57.844 --> 42:59.946
- Yeah, I gotta go.
We've anchored.

43:00.046 --> 43:01.681
- And you have to go
drop anchor right now.

43:01.715 --> 43:04.050
Okay, well, that's
a perfect way to end this.

43:04.084 --> 43:05.919
I wanna thank the crew
of Lady Michelle

43:05.952 --> 43:07.754
for an epic season.

43:07.787 --> 43:09.923
I'm Andy Cohen,
good night, everybody.

43:09.956 --> 43:11.224
Thank you all so much.

43:11.257 --> 43:12.258
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

43:12.292 --> 43:13.159
- Bye, Andy.
- Bye.

43:13.193 --> 43:14.327
- Go drop anchor, Malia.

43:14.361 --> 43:14.461
- We love you.
