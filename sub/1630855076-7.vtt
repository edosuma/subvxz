WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:03.378
FELICIA: Oh, my God,
we've been to 1,500 places,

00:03.378 --> 00:04.880
and my feet are frickin'
killing me.

00:04.880 --> 00:06.882
For the love of Larry Bird,
please tell me

00:06.882 --> 00:08.175
you don't hate this one, too.

00:08.175 --> 00:10.302
It is so cute.

00:10.302 --> 00:11.970
Decent closet space.

00:11.970 --> 00:13.764
Water pressure's wild.
You basically have

00:13.764 --> 00:15.557
a mini Niagara Falls in there.

00:15.557 --> 00:18.727
-I think I love it.
-All right, here we go!

00:18.727 --> 00:21.438
You're an adult now,
grown-ass lady.

00:21.438 --> 00:23.482
Wow. I can't believe
this is gonna be mine.

00:23.482 --> 00:25.108
I'm really gonna live here.

00:25.108 --> 00:26.652
Like, I'm gonna wake up here
in the morning,

00:26.652 --> 00:29.071
you know, and-and make
a little cup of coffee,

00:29.071 --> 00:32.741
and... and just sit here
and enjoy the view.

00:35.452 --> 00:38.580
But also, I actually really like
it when the blinds are down.

00:38.580 --> 00:40.499
I feel like it just has
a nice, mysterious vibe.

00:40.499 --> 00:42.292
-SAMANTHA: Yeah.
-BRIT: Yeah.

00:44.461 --> 00:46.380
Yeah.

00:49.925 --> 00:52.386
This ice cream's
your higher power?

00:52.386 --> 00:53.971
-Why not?
-Okay.

00:53.971 --> 00:55.472
I love it. I love it.
My-my Bat Mitzvah theme

00:55.472 --> 00:56.640
was Ben & Jerry's flavors.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.267
Weird impulse
to want to lick your God.

00:58.267 --> 01:00.560
Also, can I just be honest?

01:00.560 --> 01:02.437
I feel like you can do better
than this flavor.

01:02.437 --> 01:04.356
Like, what even is it?

01:04.356 --> 01:06.233
It's maple pecan bacon.
It was my dad's favorite.

01:06.233 --> 01:07.818
Samantha.

01:07.818 --> 01:09.403
No. Okay, it's not
a dead dad, thing, okay?

01:09.403 --> 01:11.280
It's just
it's dead dad adjacent.

01:11.280 --> 01:14.491
Your dad was very,
very fallible.

01:14.491 --> 01:16.285
He clearly had terrible taste
in ice cream.

01:16.285 --> 01:17.911
-(scoffs)
-He left you and your mom.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.913
Don't make me go through
the whole speech again, please.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.790
-We're both better than that.
-Okay, I won't. I won't.

01:21.790 --> 01:25.085
But, you know, if I let go
of him, what's left?

01:25.085 --> 01:28.255
Well, that's exactly the point.

01:28.255 --> 01:30.507
Babe, space.

01:32.301 --> 01:34.469
You will have the space

01:34.469 --> 01:36.430
to really let something else in.

01:37.723 --> 01:40.100
Yeah, it just...
It better not be God.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.893
She's really not for me.

01:41.893 --> 01:45.564
Don't put pressure on yourself
to figure it all out.

01:45.564 --> 01:48.608
Just leave it open

01:48.608 --> 01:50.986
and allow it to come in.

01:50.986 --> 01:53.363
Higher powers are like
pornography.

01:53.363 --> 01:55.657
You'll know it when you see it.

01:55.657 --> 01:58.285
-What if it is pornography?
-Oh, my God.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.954
-You're insane.
No, it's not. It's not.
-(laughing)

02:00.954 --> 02:02.664
I want mint chocolate chip.
Come on.

02:02.664 --> 02:06.126
So when am I gonna see
this apartment of yours?

02:06.126 --> 02:08.253
Not for a while.

02:08.253 --> 02:09.671
All right?
'Cause I know you're gonna ask

02:09.671 --> 02:11.506
about murders and mold,

02:11.506 --> 02:13.675
and the landlord'll get
super annoyed and kick me out

02:13.675 --> 02:15.302
before I even get
one night's sleep there.

02:15.302 --> 02:17.429
-Samantha.
-Mom.

02:17.429 --> 02:21.183
I'm gonna respect the boundaries
you are setting right now.

02:22.351 --> 02:25.479
Wow. Thank you.

02:25.479 --> 02:28.482
If you ever, for any reason,

02:28.482 --> 02:31.151
need to come back,
you always have a home here.

02:34.905 --> 02:36.782
Thank you, Mom.

02:40.577 --> 02:43.580
Okay, the movers will be by
later for the rest of this.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.707
-Okay.
-And I love you.

02:45.707 --> 02:47.167
Love you, too.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.169
-Bye.
-Bye.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.171
(Carol sniffles)

02:55.509 --> 02:57.719
♪ ♪

02:57.719 --> 02:59.971
So, when does
this runner's high kick in?

02:59.971 --> 03:02.307
Oh, I don't... I don't run.
It's terrible for the knees.

03:02.307 --> 03:04.309
-Why the hell am I doing it?
-Because you refused

03:04.309 --> 03:06.520
-to do squats.
-Oh, yeah.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.730
-Uh, how-how is she?
-She's good.

03:08.730 --> 03:12.484
She's Carol. Actually,
she's kind of like Carol 2.0.

03:12.484 --> 03:13.944
Kind of seems like
she's actually trying

03:13.944 --> 03:16.571
to be better, at least a little.
(panting)

03:16.571 --> 03:19.366
-Oh.
-(sighs)

03:19.366 --> 03:20.575
Maybe I should call her.
Should I call her?

03:20.575 --> 03:22.411
No, Bob, you shouldn't call her.

03:22.411 --> 03:24.663
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-It's got to be
on her to call you.

03:24.663 --> 03:26.706
-You know what I mean? Yeah.
-Yeah, yeah.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.208
Maybe just a text?
Like an article she might like,

03:28.208 --> 03:29.501
-or a recipe.
-No.

03:29.501 --> 03:31.128
-No.
-No contact.

03:31.128 --> 03:32.796
I don't want to do that, either.

03:32.796 --> 03:35.841
-All right, well, um,
how do you feel?
-The same.

03:35.841 --> 03:37.342
-Yeah? Okay.
-Yeah.

03:37.342 --> 03:38.802
But, hey, maybe next time,
we go see a movie.

03:38.802 --> 03:40.303
You know?
Maybe we're movie friends.

03:40.303 --> 03:42.013
I don't ever want
to do this again.

03:42.013 --> 03:44.474
Okay, well, uh, as long
as we can keep hanging out,

03:44.474 --> 03:46.393
that'd be great, you know?

03:46.393 --> 03:50.981
I just really enjoy having a
stepdaughter figure in my life.

03:50.981 --> 03:53.650
-A stepdaughter figure?
-Yeah. (laughs)

03:53.650 --> 03:56.319
Come here, Bob.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.155
-Thank you.
-I'm sorry I'm so sweaty.

03:58.155 --> 04:01.366
No, actually, you're not. You
did four minutes and 18 seconds.

04:01.366 --> 04:05.203
But you know what I always say--
"No pain, some gain."

04:05.203 --> 04:07.873
-Yeah.
-Huh.

04:07.873 --> 04:10.041
ALL:
The courage to change
the things we can

04:10.041 --> 04:12.711
and the wisdom
to know the difference.

04:12.711 --> 04:14.629
MINDY:
Keep coming back.

04:14.629 --> 04:16.214
It works if you work it.

04:16.214 --> 04:17.507
I know.

04:24.097 --> 04:28.643
So, I know we don't get speeches
for 60 days,

04:28.643 --> 04:31.271
but just want to say,
I'm here to stay.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.482
-Not getting rid of me.
-Mm.

04:33.482 --> 04:36.401
I have nine years,
not that we're comparing.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.361
Feels like we're comparing.

04:38.361 --> 04:41.072
Sometimes a healthy competition
is... it's a good thing.

04:41.072 --> 04:42.574
JAMES:
Uh, I don't know about that.

04:42.574 --> 04:45.160
-Hi.
-Hey. Welcome back.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.204
-Thanks.
-It's nice to see you here.

04:47.204 --> 04:48.955
It's really nice to be here.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.707
JAMES:
I don't know what it is, but

04:50.707 --> 04:52.459
I've never felt more connected
to people.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.127
Today felt different.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.421
Yeah, it felt different.
It definitely did, yeah.

04:57.672 --> 04:59.841
It-it didn't, actually.
I really wanted...

04:59.841 --> 05:02.260
I wanted to feel something,
but I just felt sweaty palms.

05:02.260 --> 05:04.596
That's 'cause you stand
next to Mark in the circle.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.681
You ate all the cookies,
but didn't leave any money

05:06.681 --> 05:08.767
in the basket? Come on.

05:08.767 --> 05:11.102
What's the point of...

05:11.102 --> 05:13.230
Uh, hi.

05:13.230 --> 05:16.900
Hi. I am, uh, really sorry

05:16.900 --> 05:18.860
about everything that happened
after Dean's funeral.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.821
Yeah, you came at me
pretty hard.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.323
I did, didn't I? Yeah.

05:23.323 --> 05:27.160
I'm sorry. That day kind
of spun me out, and, uh...

05:27.160 --> 05:30.038
Turns out I have really
shitty coping mechanisms, so...

05:30.038 --> 05:33.458
Yeah, I have the same ones,
but I appreciate the apology.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.043
-Cool.
-Cool.

05:35.043 --> 05:38.672
Can we, um, start over?

05:38.672 --> 05:41.383
Hi. I'm James.

05:41.383 --> 05:43.385
Sam. Nice to meet you.

05:43.385 --> 05:45.303
-Hmm.
-Congrats on 60 days.

05:45.303 --> 05:46.763
-Thank you.
-Mm.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.431
Yeah. Friends can hug, right?

05:48.431 --> 05:49.975
I think
I've seen friends hug before.

05:49.975 --> 05:51.518
Yeah, of course, of course.

05:51.518 --> 05:54.104
Oh, look at you two.

05:54.104 --> 05:57.691
Back on your
heteronormative bullshit.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.577
(doorbell rings)

06:12.497 --> 06:14.291
Hi.

06:14.291 --> 06:17.502
-Hey. Yo.
-Uh, Happy Divorce Day.

06:17.502 --> 06:20.714
Happy Divorce Day.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.048
(chuckles softly)

06:22.048 --> 06:23.967
-So, uh...
-Hey, uh,

06:23.967 --> 06:25.927
before we sign the papers,
you want a little toursky?

06:25.927 --> 06:27.262
See the house you were
supposed to live in?

06:27.262 --> 06:29.097
I kid.

06:29.097 --> 06:30.223
But seriously, though,
I mean, the bathroom

06:30.223 --> 06:31.474
-has a bidet.
-I don't doubt it.

06:31.474 --> 06:33.602
I mean, Joel,
this house is gorgeous.

06:33.602 --> 06:35.937
-Thank you.
-The porch is so cute.

06:35.937 --> 06:37.772
-Yeah.
-Look at these plants

06:37.772 --> 06:39.566
-Yeah.
-and bespoke detail.

06:39.566 --> 06:42.110
-Right? Came out good, I think.
-Yeah.

06:42.110 --> 06:43.111
Hey, do you ever think
about painting the door?

06:43.111 --> 06:44.779
Yeah, you would have
chosen orange.

06:44.779 --> 06:47.574
-Then we'd be in hot water
with the HOA.
-See?

06:47.574 --> 06:49.367
Designing this house together
totally would have done us in.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.077
-(laughs)
-Yeah.

06:52.621 --> 06:56.291
So, should we sign the papers?

06:56.291 --> 06:59.419
Sure. Yeah. After you.

07:03.298 --> 07:04.924
And sign here, too, right?

07:06.676 --> 07:08.887
Joel? You okay?

07:08.887 --> 07:10.555
Was it me?

07:11.973 --> 07:14.726
Is it my fault
that we didn't work out?

07:15.852 --> 07:17.896
(sighs)

07:17.896 --> 07:20.440
Wasn't you.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.693
I guess it all comes down to...
I wasn't ready yet.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.695
And I needed
to live more and grow up,

07:25.695 --> 07:28.823
and I had no business
being married yet.

07:28.823 --> 07:31.993
Not to you, not to anyone.

07:31.993 --> 07:34.913
You know how we had that joke
that if I had a chance

07:34.913 --> 07:36.956
with Michael B. Jordan,
all bets would be off?

07:36.956 --> 07:38.625
That was more your joke
than our joke, but, yeah.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.460
Uh, the point is...

07:41.836 --> 07:43.088
...I wouldn't have
married him either.

07:44.339 --> 07:46.091
I really hated hurting you.

07:46.091 --> 07:48.510
And I've been
punishing myself for it.

07:48.510 --> 07:50.762
But it just... it wasn't time.

07:52.305 --> 07:55.058
-I shouldn't have said yes.
-No, this is on me, too.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.893
I knew something wasn't right.

07:56.893 --> 07:58.436
All the warning signs
were there.

07:58.436 --> 07:59.938
I just didn't check in.

07:59.938 --> 08:01.481
You know, I just...

08:01.481 --> 08:03.483
I ran away with things,

08:03.483 --> 08:05.652
and I'm sorry.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.654
Thank you.

08:09.197 --> 08:11.491
(sighs)
Well,

08:11.491 --> 08:14.077
at least you got
a really nice house out of it.

08:14.077 --> 08:17.247
Yeah. I mean, I really ran away
with a fantasy, though.

08:17.247 --> 08:18.832
-Like, I put marble everywhere.
-Oh.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.792
You know that bidet
that you liked?

08:20.792 --> 08:22.544
I put one in every bathroom.

08:22.544 --> 08:24.003
Oh, well,
no one is mad at a bidet.

08:24.003 --> 08:26.005
I'm a little mad
at these bidets.

08:26.005 --> 08:27.882
They were several
thousand dollars, from Japan.

08:27.882 --> 08:29.467
They say "hi" to you.

08:29.467 --> 08:32.137
(laughs)
Well, that's it.

08:32.137 --> 08:34.389
We are officially divorced.

08:34.389 --> 08:35.765
-Should we celebrate?
-Um...

08:35.765 --> 08:37.142
-We should celebrate.
-Okay.

08:37.142 --> 08:38.560
I can cook us dinner.

08:38.560 --> 08:39.894
I actually have two ovens
'cause I thought

08:39.894 --> 08:41.396
we were gonna do a ton
of hosting,

08:41.396 --> 08:43.106
but we never even had
a housewarming party.

08:43.106 --> 08:46.276
Well, let's have
a divorce party.

08:46.276 --> 08:49.821
Yes, we could just have
a proper goodbye to all of this.

08:49.821 --> 08:52.741
Sure. I accidentally just bought
a case of probiotic soda

08:52.741 --> 08:54.617
from Costco, and I've
been meaning to unload it,

08:54.617 --> 08:56.077
so that actually
works really well.

08:56.077 --> 08:57.746
Oh, and I've got, like,
40 frozen pot pies

08:57.746 --> 08:59.080
-in the freezer.
-Oh, I'm gonna stop you there.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.082
-We're gonna order food. Yeah.
-Order food, yeah.

09:01.082 --> 09:02.000
That's what I was thinking,
too. Like, we can do that.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.001
FELICIA:
Let me just check

09:03.001 --> 09:05.003
on that real quick, okay?

09:06.087 --> 09:07.380
Hey.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.924
-Hey, beautiful.
-Hi.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.926
-I brought you
some hot chocolate.
-Huh?

09:11.926 --> 09:13.303
-Mm-hmm.
-You never come in
during the middle of the day.

09:13.303 --> 09:15.180
What's going on?

09:15.180 --> 09:17.140
Uh, can't a guy just bring
something sweet to his sweetie?

09:17.140 --> 09:19.267
Thank you so much.

09:19.267 --> 09:20.977
-That was very sweet of you.
-(laughs)

09:20.977 --> 09:23.021
But, uh, you know,
I got to get to Mrs. Harris.

09:23.021 --> 09:24.564
She falls asleep in the chair if
I don't get to her immediately.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.274
-So...
-Oh.

09:26.274 --> 09:27.942
But I'll see you at Brit
and Joel's tonight, right?

09:27.942 --> 09:30.028
Yeah, for sure. There's, um...

09:30.028 --> 09:32.822
There's actually something
I want to talk to you about.

09:32.822 --> 09:35.325
Oh. Mmm.

09:35.325 --> 09:37.410
-See you tonight?
-Yeah.

09:37.410 --> 09:40.371
-Bye, Petey.
-Bye.

09:40.371 --> 09:42.832
He is such
a little honeybutt, right?

09:42.832 --> 09:44.751
-Let me see your hands.
-What?

09:44.751 --> 09:47.253
Let me see your hands.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.881
Ay, mami, you need
to go get a manicure, stat.

09:49.881 --> 09:51.841
-I just got these done.
You don't like the plaid?
-No.

09:51.841 --> 09:54.219
That man is proposing
to you tonight.

09:54.219 --> 09:55.178
-No.
-Sí.

09:55.178 --> 09:56.346
What?

09:56.346 --> 09:57.555
-Mm-hmm.
-No.

09:57.555 --> 09:59.432
-Mm-hmm.
-You don't know

09:59.432 --> 10:00.767
what you're talking about, Tina.
That's crazy.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.936
Bitch, I've been
engaged four times.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.312
-You have?
-And divorced twice.

10:04.312 --> 10:06.731
-Oh.
-I'd do red.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.566
It really makes diamonds pop.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.908
Hey.

10:16.908 --> 10:18.868
-Alex?
-(muffled music
through headphones)

10:18.868 --> 10:20.203
Alex?

10:20.203 --> 10:22.122
-Oh, hey.
-Hey. Uh,

10:22.122 --> 10:24.040
where is everybody? I thought
there was a staff meeting.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.042
No, I cancelled that.

10:27.418 --> 10:30.255
Um, listen,
are you sure you're okay?

10:30.255 --> 10:32.298
'Cause you've never canceled
a meeting before.

10:32.298 --> 10:35.009
Maybe I'm a just boss
that's excited for the weekend.

10:35.009 --> 10:37.720
-Alex, come on.
-All right.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.598
No. You know what?
I needed a break.

10:40.598 --> 10:42.892
I come in here every day
and I have to see you.

10:42.892 --> 10:45.186
And all I want to do is
be in a relationship with you,

10:45.186 --> 10:47.188
but I know that's a dead end.

10:47.188 --> 10:50.900
So, this just all sucks,
and I don't know what to do.

10:50.900 --> 10:53.444
I-I get it. I do.

10:53.444 --> 10:56.030
I-I have to avoid
eye contact with you

10:56.030 --> 10:58.408
every time you walk by my desk
to go to the bathroom.

10:58.408 --> 11:00.952
-Have you been drinking a lot
of coffee, by the way?
-No.

11:00.952 --> 11:03.246
I'm actually doing this
whole water thing now. It...

11:03.246 --> 11:04.747
-Uh, that's good.
-Yeah.

11:04.747 --> 11:06.166
Even strangers
on the street tell me

11:06.166 --> 11:07.709
I look severely
dehydrated, so...

11:07.709 --> 11:09.669
Uh, I-I don't mean to be weird,

11:09.669 --> 11:12.380
but how are we gonna
get past this

11:12.380 --> 11:14.382
and continue to work together?

11:14.382 --> 11:16.634
Yeah, I just...

11:16.634 --> 11:19.304
I really love this job,
you know?

11:19.304 --> 11:20.763
I get paid to write.

11:20.763 --> 11:23.349
So...

11:23.349 --> 11:25.310
if someone has to leave, it's...

11:25.310 --> 11:27.478
it's not gonna be me.

11:31.274 --> 11:33.151
FELICIA:
He can't fire you.

11:33.151 --> 11:35.653
I mean, I don't think so,
but you never know.

11:35.653 --> 11:37.614
I really don't want to go back
to the grocery store.

11:37.614 --> 11:38.823
Well, I'm just
putting it out there.

11:38.823 --> 11:40.909
I did appreciate the discount.

11:40.909 --> 11:42.452
-So, what are you gonna do?
-I don't know.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.537
Send out résumés, pray to a god
I don't believe in?

11:44.537 --> 11:46.414
Wow. This is, like,
a real house.

11:46.414 --> 11:47.957
It's really nice.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.375
I guess he is good
at building stuff.

11:49.375 --> 11:50.793
-Huh.
-His art is terrible, though.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.378
-Mm.
-Hey, uh, thanks for driving me.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.005
Oh, you're welcome. I just...

11:54.005 --> 11:55.924
I really can't be alone
with Pete right now.

11:55.924 --> 11:58.468
-But you love Pete.
-I do love Pete.

11:58.468 --> 12:00.553
But I also love
not being married to Pete.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.680
I'm a free spirit.
Like, that time

12:02.680 --> 12:04.807
I almost got that bird tattooed
on my lower back,

12:04.807 --> 12:06.309
but then I backed out
because I can't commit.

12:06.309 --> 12:08.061
Yeah, I remember.
That was a really long night.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.771
There's just so much stuff
I want to do, know you?

12:09.771 --> 12:11.439
Like, I really want
to go to New Zealand

12:11.439 --> 12:13.650
and, like, be on
Wheel of Fortune.

12:13.650 --> 12:16.819
I just don't want
to be stuck forever.

12:16.819 --> 12:19.656
♪ Spend my whole check
at Whole Foods ♪

12:19.656 --> 12:21.199
♪ Yeah, she still
texting old dudes ♪

12:21.199 --> 12:24.077
♪ I need gas money like... ♪

12:24.077 --> 12:24.994
I basically built all this,
which was nice,

12:24.994 --> 12:26.704
'cause I was alone so much,

12:26.704 --> 12:28.623
so hearing the drill
was kind of nice

12:28.623 --> 12:31.000
to get away from that kind of
crippling silence, you know?

12:31.000 --> 12:32.502
-Yes.
-And then, oh, also, um,

12:32.502 --> 12:34.587
if you look at this end table,

12:34.587 --> 12:36.756
you'll notice
there are no screws or nails

12:36.756 --> 12:38.758
or glue anywhere, so...

12:38.758 --> 12:40.969
Huh. That's interesting.

12:40.969 --> 12:42.720
I had no idea that was a thing.

12:42.720 --> 12:45.431
Oh, my God. This is in
the kanawa tsugi style?

12:45.431 --> 12:48.101
You know kanawa tsugi?

12:48.101 --> 12:50.144
Do I know about traditional
Japanese wood-joinery?

12:50.144 --> 12:52.313
Of course I do.

12:52.313 --> 12:54.524
I took a couple
woodworking classes in college.

12:54.524 --> 12:55.984
-I can't believe
you know about kanawa tsugi.
-Yeah.

12:55.984 --> 12:57.360
It's like our friendship
was meant to be, dude.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.320
-It's crazy. It's unbelievable.
-(laughing)

12:59.320 --> 13:00.738
Are those real butter crackers?

13:00.738 --> 13:02.740
Yeah.

13:02.740 --> 13:06.411
I don't eat crackers,
but I need to not be here.

13:06.411 --> 13:08.663
Also, I mean, how about this?
It's, like,

13:08.663 --> 13:09.956
we could be in our own
buddy cop movie or something.

13:09.956 --> 13:11.708
Right? Right? Right?

13:11.708 --> 13:13.001
-All right,
what's your favorite color?
-Uh... okay.

13:13.001 --> 13:14.294
-On the count of three?
-Sure.

13:14.294 --> 13:15.837
One, two, three.

13:15.837 --> 13:17.380
BOTH:
Blue, but sometimes green!

13:17.380 --> 13:18.965
-Dude, what?
That's unbelievable.
-Oh, my God.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.758
JAMES:
I was... I was gonna wear
a green shirt today.

13:20.758 --> 13:23.928
(indistinct chatter)

13:23.928 --> 13:25.847
(sighs)

13:29.976 --> 13:32.395
-Hey, Joel.
-Oh, no.

13:32.395 --> 13:34.480
-Don't worry.
I'm not gonna jump you.
-Okay.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.107
I mean, not with
this many witness around.

13:36.107 --> 13:38.526
-Right. Yes.
-I'm kidding.

13:38.526 --> 13:40.320
-You're joking. Good.
-I'm really sorry about that.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.197
I was in a bad place,
if that wasn't obvious.

13:43.197 --> 13:46.701
-Yeah. No, I kind of
picked up on that.
-Right.

13:46.701 --> 13:49.912
Listen, I don't know why
you'd want to be my friend

13:49.912 --> 13:52.165
-after that,
but if you did, we could...
-No. Sam, stop.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.083
It's not like
it's the first insane thing

13:54.083 --> 13:57.545
I've ever seen you do, so...

13:57.545 --> 14:00.131
-Let's just...
-Want to eat something?

14:00.131 --> 14:02.341
-I would love to do that.
You want cookies?
-Yeah. Yeah.

14:02.341 --> 14:05.887
-Oh.
-Oh, finally. (laughing)

14:05.887 --> 14:08.765
-(sighs)
-I've been hoping
to get a moment alone with you.

14:08.765 --> 14:12.935
-Oh, come here.
-Wait. No, no, no. No.

14:12.935 --> 14:14.771
This cannot be happening
in front of a bidet.

14:14.771 --> 14:16.898
What?

14:16.898 --> 14:19.984
-Are you proposing?
-(laughs) No.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.360
(laughing loudly)

14:21.360 --> 14:23.112
Are you?

14:23.112 --> 14:24.655
-What? No.
-What?

14:24.655 --> 14:26.532
What? Why have you
been acting so weird?

14:26.532 --> 14:28.659
(sighs)
Okay.

14:28.659 --> 14:31.454
I have you some news
I want to share with you.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.874
Okay.

14:34.874 --> 14:39.045
I, um... I got an offer from
a private practice in Michigan.

14:39.045 --> 14:41.380
-Wow.
-What?

14:41.380 --> 14:43.716
Okay, yeah.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.761
Here I am thinking you were
gonna ask me for forever, but...

14:46.761 --> 14:49.055
you're breaking up with me.

14:49.055 --> 14:52.517
Oh, no, no. No, I don't
want to break up with you.

14:52.517 --> 14:54.602
No. I-I know it's a lot,

14:54.602 --> 14:57.772
and I know
we got to think about Zacky,

14:57.772 --> 15:03.194
but I found a place
near a good school, big yard.

15:03.194 --> 15:06.489
So, do you want
to say "screw it"?

15:06.489 --> 15:09.742
Try it for a year,
go on an adventure?

15:11.911 --> 15:14.747
Uh, um, uh...

15:14.747 --> 15:16.916
I-I just need...

15:16.916 --> 15:19.168
-FEMALE VOICE: Hello.
-(both exclaim)

15:19.168 --> 15:21.129
(water squirting)

15:21.129 --> 15:23.339
-Um, no, I got
to get out of here.
-Uh...

15:23.339 --> 15:26.050
-(door opens)
-(sighs)
-Hello.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.844
(indistinct chatter)

15:27.844 --> 15:29.679
I really need some air, Sammy.

15:32.306 --> 15:35.309
(scoffs, sighs)

15:35.309 --> 15:38.271
-Shit.
-What's wrong?

15:38.271 --> 15:40.940
You guys, that son of a bitch
is moving to Michigan.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.859
-He is?
-Yeah. He took a job there.

15:42.859 --> 15:44.861
What, am I gonna go
to the New England of the West?

15:44.861 --> 15:47.029
-They haven't even won
one frickin' Super Bowl.
-Um...

15:47.029 --> 15:49.615
-I'm divorced.
-Yeah.

15:49.615 --> 15:50.867
I'm gonna have to click
the box that says "divorced"

15:50.867 --> 15:52.535
when I fill out forms.

15:52.535 --> 15:53.995
If I play "Never Have I Ever,"
and they say,

15:53.995 --> 15:56.330
"Hey, have you ever been
divorced?," I'm gonna drink.

15:56.330 --> 15:57.790
Okay, yeah, but you never have
to play "Never Have I Ever"

15:57.790 --> 15:59.208
-'cause we're too old for that.
-Right.

15:59.208 --> 16:01.043
But I feel so young.

16:01.043 --> 16:03.129
-Okay.
-I mean, my life
is complete freedom.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.923
I could do anything. Uh, I could
hike the Appalachian Trail,

16:05.923 --> 16:08.217
-go see the mountains.
-Ooh, now that I could get into.

16:08.217 --> 16:09.719
And everyone's always saying

16:09.719 --> 16:11.512
they find God in the mountains,
you know,

16:11.512 --> 16:13.139
-so maybe that could be
my higher power.
-BRIT: Wait a minute.

16:13.139 --> 16:15.141
What's happening here?
This is my freedom fantasy.

16:15.141 --> 16:17.059
No, actually, this is my
"boyfriend's moving" freak-out.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.644
-Oh, that's right. I'm sorry.
-Yeah.

16:18.644 --> 16:21.731

-(church bells chime)
-Hi.

20:19.802 --> 20:22.054
Oh, my God.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.764
Please tell me
you didn't relapse.

20:23.764 --> 20:25.349
No, I didn't.
Why would you ask me that?

20:25.349 --> 20:27.393
Babe, you slept on a roof.

20:27.393 --> 20:28.769
I actually didn't sleep at all.

20:28.769 --> 20:31.021
I came up here, and I...

20:31.021 --> 20:34.108
I don't know.
Everything kind of fell away.

20:34.108 --> 20:36.235
And I felt really small

20:36.235 --> 20:38.612
and kind of insignificant.

20:38.612 --> 20:41.198
-But in cool way, you know?
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

20:41.198 --> 20:43.075
And then my pen got hot
and I started writing,

20:43.075 --> 20:44.577
and I couldn't stop.

20:44.577 --> 20:47.288
You found it.

20:47.288 --> 20:49.874
I'm really proud of you.

20:49.874 --> 20:51.751
Thank you.

20:53.127 --> 20:55.004
What the hell is that bag?

20:55.004 --> 20:57.339
-Oh! Your housewarming presents.
-(laughs)

20:57.339 --> 20:59.967
Okay, so, you know,
addiction and anxiety.

20:59.967 --> 21:01.510
-You got IBS.
-I have IBS.

21:01.510 --> 21:03.387
Yeah, same.

21:03.387 --> 21:06.140
I don't think you're ready
to keep anything alive yet.

21:06.140 --> 21:07.600
-That is fake.
-Okay.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.769
You don't have to water it.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.771
In case you wanted to go red.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.814
Really?

21:13.814 --> 21:16.275
This is... Oh.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.736
This is for your...
upper lip hair.

21:18.736 --> 21:20.279
It's not really housewarming.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.573
I just didn't know
how to tell you.

21:22.573 --> 21:24.700
And... earplugs

21:24.700 --> 21:27.328
for the guy upstairs
blasting Tom Petty.

21:27.328 --> 21:30.498
-What guy?
-I don't know.
There's always a guy.

21:30.498 --> 21:32.333
Well, thank you.

21:32.333 --> 21:33.501
You're welcome.

21:33.501 --> 21:36.295
I want to stay up here.

21:36.295 --> 21:39.215
-Maybe I would look good
with red hair.
-Let's do it!

21:39.215 --> 21:39.924
-SAMANTHA: Really?
-Yeah. I'll do my eyebrows.
