00:05.222 --> 00:05.396
.

00:05.440 --> 00:07.224
- Merry Christmas.

00:07.268 --> 00:09.705
- What happened,
that was just for fun.

00:10.532 --> 00:12.403
- I'm sorry for the stress
that I caused you

00:12.447 --> 00:14.492
for wanting you here.
- I understand why you did it.

00:14.536 --> 00:16.364
You had a daughter
and you wanted to meet her.

00:16.407 --> 00:19.019
Maggie Lockwood
is my biological mother.

00:19.454 --> 00:21.499
- For every Vas-COM catheter
the hospital ordered,

00:21.543 --> 00:23.240
Dr. Cooper
received a percentage.

00:23.284 --> 00:25.242
- I mean isn't this
kinda like kickbacks?

00:25.286 --> 00:26.722
It's illegal.

00:26.765 --> 00:29.333
- We can go to the FBI now.
- The board does not feel

00:29.377 --> 00:31.205
that is in the hospital's
best interests.

00:31.901 --> 00:33.163
- Matthew Cooper,

00:33.207 --> 00:34.686
Jessa Rinaldi,
you're under arrest.

00:34.730 --> 00:37.689
- Any and all fallout
lands on me.

00:37.733 --> 00:41.041
- Believe me, Sharon,
there will be fallout.

00:43.217 --> 00:44.522
- There she is.

00:44.566 --> 00:46.220
- Sharon Goodwin.

00:46.263 --> 00:48.004
Dr. Matthew Cooper
is out on bail.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.919
Vasik Lab
is denying any knowledge

00:49.962 --> 00:51.529
of the alleged fraud schemes.

00:51.573 --> 00:53.357
- That it was the work
of their rep, Jessa Rinaldi.

00:53.401 --> 00:54.837
Government even have a case?

00:54.880 --> 00:56.186
- Listen, I have no comment.

00:56.230 --> 00:58.406
- There are reports
of impending civil actions

00:58.449 --> 01:00.669
from families and patients
affected by the Vas-COM.

01:00.712 --> 01:01.757
- You've been named
in any of these suits?

01:01.800 --> 01:03.193
- I said no comment.
- Excuse me.

01:03.237 --> 01:04.890
Excuse me for a second.
Excuse me.

01:04.934 --> 01:06.066
- Thanks.

01:06.109 --> 01:07.850
- Yes...

01:07.893 --> 01:11.810
I use--used the Vas-COM

01:11.854 --> 01:14.552
for cardiac monitoring
on some patients.

01:14.596 --> 01:16.337
- Eleanor Holt, now deceased,

01:16.380 --> 01:18.948
was one of those patients?

01:18.991 --> 01:20.558
- Yes.
- The hospital uses

01:20.602 --> 01:22.778
multiple cardiac monitoring
devices, correct?

01:22.821 --> 01:23.909
- Yes.

01:23.953 --> 01:25.694
- Still you opted
for the Vas-COM?

01:25.737 --> 01:27.870
- It was promoted
as a better option

01:27.913 --> 01:29.219
than the competing devices.

01:29.263 --> 01:32.179
It was getting talked up
a lot by other doctors.

01:32.222 --> 01:34.442
- Anyone in particular?

01:34.485 --> 01:37.097
- I've only been at Med
a few months.

01:37.140 --> 01:40.274
I know some faces
but not many names.

01:40.317 --> 01:43.233
- Was one of those faces
Dr. Will Halstead?

01:44.626 --> 01:46.628
Why don't we come back
to that question?

01:46.671 --> 01:49.805
I've already gotten a statement
from Dr. Halstead.

01:53.809 --> 01:54.679
[phone beeps gently]

01:58.205 --> 01:59.728
- How's that 15 minutes
going for you?

01:59.771 --> 02:01.947
- What? Of fame?
That was the last thing

02:01.991 --> 02:04.820
I was thinking about
when I called the FBI.

02:04.863 --> 02:08.911
And now
all that hoopla out there.

02:08.954 --> 02:11.740
I'm worried
about the hospital, Daniel.

02:11.783 --> 02:15.265
The feds are seizing files,
computers.

02:15.309 --> 02:18.268
They're interviewing
board members and staff.

02:18.312 --> 02:20.749
- Look, it's a little crazy
right now, okay?

02:20.792 --> 02:22.664
But the dust
will settle, you know?

02:22.707 --> 02:24.100
It always does.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.276
- Sharon.

02:26.320 --> 02:28.887
Just heard an interesting fact.

02:28.931 --> 02:32.195
It turns out whistleblowers
are entitled to a reward.

02:32.239 --> 02:35.155
Six, even seven figures.

02:35.198 --> 02:36.417
How 'bout that?

02:39.507 --> 02:41.683
- Always a pleasure, Roger.

02:42.292 --> 02:44.251
- You got the chart?
You up to speed?

02:44.294 --> 02:46.340
- Yeah. Lawrence Givens, 50,

02:46.383 --> 02:47.689
end-stage renal disease.

02:47.732 --> 02:50.039
No longer tolerating
hemodialysis.

02:50.082 --> 02:51.823
Grafts keep clotting.

02:51.867 --> 02:54.217
But he only has one kidney
to begin with.

02:54.261 --> 02:57.307
- Yeah. He donated the other
to his father 25 years ago.

02:57.351 --> 02:59.048
He also has kidney disease.

02:59.091 --> 03:00.745
Turns out it's a genetic issue.

03:00.789 --> 03:04.096
Autosomal dominant
polycystic kidney disease.

03:04.140 --> 03:05.272
Lawrence has it too.

03:05.315 --> 03:07.230
- Yet the doctor
still took his kidney.

03:07.274 --> 03:08.449
They missed it.

03:08.492 --> 03:09.711
Either a misdiagnosis

03:09.754 --> 03:12.279
or the screening
didn't pick it up.

03:12.322 --> 03:14.585
- Oh, man.

03:14.629 --> 03:16.848
Chart says Lawrence has a son.

03:16.892 --> 03:18.328
- Luke, he's 19.

03:18.372 --> 03:19.547
He hasn't been tested

03:19.590 --> 03:21.897
to see if he also
has polycystic kidneys.

03:21.940 --> 03:23.986
- Okay, so if he doesn't
have the disease,

03:24.029 --> 03:25.292
he could be a possible donor.

03:25.335 --> 03:27.163
- I've thought about
testing him a few times

03:27.207 --> 03:28.599
and always shied away.

03:28.643 --> 03:30.253
- Why?

03:30.297 --> 03:35.084
- It's complicated.

03:35.127 --> 03:38.392
Hi, Luke. It's Dr. Blake.

03:38.435 --> 03:40.394
- You remember Dr. Blake,
don't you?

03:40.437 --> 03:42.352
She's helping
fix Daddy's kidney.

03:42.396 --> 03:45.355
- I want to help too.

03:45.399 --> 03:49.664
- I know you do. I know you do.

03:49.707 --> 03:51.231
- It's good to see you again,
Luke.

03:51.274 --> 03:52.884
This is Dr. Marcel.

03:52.928 --> 03:55.887
- Hey, Luke.
Pleasure to meet you.

03:55.931 --> 03:58.020
- Luke, honey,

03:58.063 --> 04:00.283
let's let the doctor
speak with your dad.

04:00.327 --> 04:01.676
Come on.

04:01.719 --> 04:04.287
All right, there we go.

04:05.854 --> 04:07.334
Okay?

04:09.423 --> 04:10.859
- Look, I can hold out.

04:10.902 --> 04:12.556
I know there's
a donor somewhere.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.428
I mean, I've gotta be on top
of the transplant list.

04:14.471 --> 04:17.648
- You are
but time is running out.

04:17.692 --> 04:20.564
I think we should consider Luke
as a possible donor now.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.392
At least test
for polycystic disease,

04:22.436 --> 04:23.959
make sure he doesn't have it.

04:24.002 --> 04:26.091
- I want to be with Daddy.
He needs my help.

04:26.135 --> 04:27.571
- We're gonna help him.

04:27.615 --> 04:31.706
- [sighs] I don't know.

04:31.749 --> 04:34.099
- You need a new kidney,
Lawrence.

04:34.143 --> 04:35.579
And I truly believe
that Luke is your best,

04:35.623 --> 04:38.365
and possibly,
last chance to get one.

04:43.979 --> 04:45.285
- Okay.

05:03.477 --> 05:03.912
.

05:03.955 --> 05:05.914
- Luke wants to help
his father.

05:05.957 --> 05:07.263
I can get behind that.
- Believe me,

05:07.307 --> 05:08.786
I want to also
but his developmental ability--

05:08.830 --> 05:09.918
I mean what are we talking
about here?

05:09.961 --> 05:10.919
- Look, it's not ideal,

05:10.962 --> 05:12.573
but we don't have
a better move.

05:12.616 --> 05:15.097
And Luke needs his dad.

05:15.140 --> 05:16.707
I've known Lawrence
for a long time now

05:16.751 --> 05:18.361
and Luke is always
his first concern

05:18.405 --> 05:20.102
and he gave us the okay.

05:30.373 --> 05:32.201
- Okay.

05:32.244 --> 05:33.594
So we're on
safe ground legally.

05:33.637 --> 05:35.291
What about morally?

05:35.335 --> 05:36.901
- All right.

05:36.945 --> 05:38.947
I'll take it
to the ethics committee.

05:38.990 --> 05:41.341
Get their opinion.

05:42.037 --> 05:43.430
- Negative CT
and clinically improved

05:43.473 --> 05:45.649
for the patient in five.
He can be discharged.

05:45.693 --> 05:47.956
Want me to put it through?
- I've got it. It's okay.

05:47.999 --> 05:51.176
A flu in two and
dislocated shoulder in seven.

05:53.614 --> 05:55.703
- Can't believe you're her mom.

05:55.746 --> 05:57.095
How'd you keep that so quiet?

05:57.139 --> 05:59.228
- Easy, I didn't tell you.

05:59.271 --> 06:00.447
- Ha.

06:00.490 --> 06:04.842
So...who's the dad?

06:04.886 --> 06:06.278
- Why don't you turn over five?

06:09.107 --> 06:10.631
- Good morning, Will.

06:10.674 --> 06:11.936
Oh, hey.

06:11.980 --> 06:13.460
Another article
in the Trib this morning

06:13.503 --> 06:15.940
about your takedown
of corporate greed, yeah?

06:15.984 --> 06:17.812
- Yeah. My email's blowing up.

06:17.855 --> 06:19.640
- Well then, I guess
you won't be needing this, huh?

06:19.683 --> 06:20.989
I thought you might want
to cut out the article

06:21.032 --> 06:22.817
and use it in your--
your scrapbook,

06:22.860 --> 06:24.296
you know,
put it on your trophy display?

06:24.340 --> 06:26.037
- I didn't do it
for the accolades, Dean.

06:26.081 --> 06:27.648
- Hey, um, I got your back
on this one.

06:27.691 --> 06:29.998
I mean, you--you went
out on a limb for justice

06:30.041 --> 06:31.782
and you won. Proud of you.

06:31.826 --> 06:33.349
Truly.

06:35.220 --> 06:37.048
- Spent the morning with feds

06:37.092 --> 06:39.486
and they wanna talk again soon.

06:39.529 --> 06:41.052
Thank you very much.

06:41.096 --> 06:43.403
- Hey, I'm sorry, Stevie.

06:43.446 --> 06:45.666
Really. I didn't--I didn't mean
for you get caught up in this.

06:45.709 --> 06:48.059
- Then why didn't you read me
in on what was going on?

06:48.103 --> 06:51.193
Especially when it came
to Eleanor Holt.

06:51.236 --> 06:52.281
If I'd known what you knew,

06:52.324 --> 06:53.891
I might have treated
her differently.

06:53.935 --> 06:55.763
- Halstead, Hammer, you're up.
You're going to treatment 3.

06:55.806 --> 06:57.547
Chart's in your tablet.

07:01.856 --> 07:05.250
- Mr. Sanon, I'm Dr. Halston.
This is Dr. Hammer.

07:05.294 --> 07:06.208
- Hi.

07:06.251 --> 07:07.644
So I can see you got a bum arm

07:07.688 --> 07:09.777
and a lump on the head.
What happened?

07:09.820 --> 07:11.909
- Um, he doesn't speak English.

07:11.953 --> 07:14.042
I'm his son, Emmanuel.

07:14.085 --> 07:17.437
[speaks native language]

07:18.002 --> 07:20.004
- [speaks native language]
- Okay.

07:20.048 --> 07:22.703
He says he's okay
with me doing the talking.

07:22.746 --> 07:24.095
- Great. French?

07:24.139 --> 07:25.270
- Haitian Creole.

07:25.314 --> 07:26.576
I've been in the U.S.
a few years.

07:26.620 --> 07:29.013
My father was finally
able to join me.

07:29.057 --> 07:31.102
He got out this past summer.

07:33.365 --> 07:36.325
- So, Emmanuel, what happened?

07:36.368 --> 07:38.980
- Last couple of months,
he's been a little off.

07:39.023 --> 07:41.417
Dizziness, confusion.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.246
But Chicago moves a lot faster
than rural Haiti.

07:44.289 --> 07:46.553
- Yeah. Culture shock
must be staggering.

07:46.596 --> 07:49.033
- Yeah. That's why
I didn't think much of it.

07:49.077 --> 07:52.080
But recently
he's been clumsy too.

07:52.123 --> 07:53.429
Today, he missed a step

07:53.473 --> 07:54.865
like he didn't know
where it was,

07:54.909 --> 07:56.258
fell down the stairs.

07:56.301 --> 07:58.129
- Lungs are good,
heart seemed normal

07:58.173 --> 08:00.349
but can't rule out
a syncopal episode.

08:00.392 --> 08:03.657
- Let's get a chest X-ray,
a 12-lead EKG, cardiac labs,

08:03.700 --> 08:06.355
CBC, BMP, and a head CT.

08:06.398 --> 08:08.531
- [speaks native language]

08:08.575 --> 08:10.707
- Um, he is asking
if his fiancée, Fabienne,

08:10.751 --> 08:12.013
can come to the hospital?

08:12.056 --> 08:14.798
- Of course, yeah.
Give the nurse her number.

08:14.842 --> 08:17.148
- [speaks native language]
- Okay. Merci.

08:17.192 --> 08:18.759
- You're welcome.

08:18.802 --> 08:20.717
- We'll check back soon.

08:24.199 --> 08:26.593
- How you holding up?

08:26.636 --> 08:30.292
- Uh...been better.

08:30.335 --> 08:31.902
Put colleagues
in an uncomfortable spot.

08:31.946 --> 08:34.035
Not what I wanted.
- I hear that.

08:34.078 --> 08:37.081
FBI speak to you yet?
- Yeah.

08:37.125 --> 08:38.518
Told me you made it very clear

08:38.561 --> 08:40.258
that I was working
on your behalf.

08:40.302 --> 08:42.957
- I did because it's true.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.437
We're gonna get through this.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.665
- Peter, really?

08:55.709 --> 08:57.493
Shutting me out
of budget meetings?

08:57.537 --> 08:58.973
- Well, the board
can't fire you.

08:59.016 --> 09:00.322
You're the hero.

09:00.365 --> 09:02.585
- And this is their plan
to put me in purgatory?

09:02.629 --> 09:04.195
- What do you expect?
There's stink

09:04.239 --> 09:06.328
all over Med right now. We're
getting hammered

09:06.371 --> 09:08.417
by the press,
donors are fleeing,

09:08.460 --> 09:10.288
doctors are getting poached
by other hospitals.

09:10.332 --> 09:12.116
Had three more
resignations today.

09:12.160 --> 09:13.509
These are department
heads, Sharon.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.207
- Silencing me is not
gonna clean up their mess.

09:16.251 --> 09:18.514
- I suspect the board
knows that.

09:18.558 --> 09:19.646
- Suspect?

09:20.560 --> 09:21.822
Look,

09:21.865 --> 09:23.867
as a Sharon Goodwin ally,
I'm out of the loop.

09:23.911 --> 09:27.044
But if I had a guess,
they're gonna come at you.

09:27.088 --> 09:29.090
And I doubt it's gonna be
from head-on.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.578
- What'd they say?
- The ethics committee's

09:38.621 --> 09:41.668
comfortable with moving ahead
with Luke as a possible donor.

09:41.711 --> 09:42.582
Look, do the tests.

09:42.625 --> 09:43.713
See if he's even a candidate,

09:43.757 --> 09:45.497
then we'll go from there.

09:52.635 --> 09:54.158
- Sharon Goodwin?

09:54.202 --> 09:55.682
- Yes.

09:55.725 --> 09:57.640
- Randall Shentu.

09:57.684 --> 09:59.773
- Can I help you
with something?

09:59.816 --> 10:02.732
- Oh, I assumed
you'd be expecting me.

10:02.776 --> 10:04.560
Nobody told you?

10:04.604 --> 10:06.736
- Why don't we talk
in my office?

10:09.696 --> 10:14.439
"The Shentu Group,
health care consultancy?"

10:14.483 --> 10:18.052
- We provide hospitals
with practical guidance

10:18.095 --> 10:21.708
to navigate the ever-evolving
healthcare landscape,

10:21.751 --> 10:25.363
whether it be regulatory,
operational, fiscal,

10:25.407 --> 10:27.452
or reputational management.

10:27.496 --> 10:30.455
- You got a lot going on
after your name.

10:30.499 --> 10:35.112
President, CEO, MD, JD.

10:35.156 --> 10:37.201
Impressive.

10:37.245 --> 10:39.160
Why are you here, Mr. Shentu?

10:40.727 --> 10:43.381
- Board told me
you don't mess around.

10:45.209 --> 10:47.168
They've brought me on
to help Med

10:47.211 --> 10:50.693
through this challenging time.

10:50.737 --> 10:54.436
To establish a culture
of transparency with vendors,

10:54.479 --> 10:56.786
device companies, reps,

10:56.830 --> 10:58.135
and especially patients.

10:58.179 --> 10:59.746
- You mean Med's business

10:59.789 --> 11:02.923
shouldn't happen
behind closed doors?

11:02.966 --> 11:04.707
- Exactly. Well said.

11:04.751 --> 11:06.100
- I hope so.

11:06.143 --> 11:07.710
It's been my mission at Med

11:07.754 --> 11:11.671
since I started here
as a nurse 35 years ago.

11:11.714 --> 11:15.805
- I'm sorry.
I meant no disrespect.

11:15.849 --> 11:18.808
And I need to acknowledge
your leadership.

11:18.852 --> 11:21.724
Exposing Dr. Cooper's
abuse of the Vas-COM

11:21.768 --> 11:24.466
was brave, admirable.

11:24.509 --> 11:27.251
I'm not here
to be an obstructionist,

11:27.295 --> 11:30.994
but right now Med's in trouble.

11:31.038 --> 11:33.214
And, uh, if it gets worse,

11:33.257 --> 11:36.347
ultimately, it'll be
the patients that suffer.

11:38.175 --> 11:41.135
I don't want that.

11:41.178 --> 11:43.572
- Then we have something
in common.

11:43.615 --> 11:45.835
- Mm.

11:45.879 --> 11:48.882
- I'm gonna take you
at your word.

11:48.925 --> 11:50.187
- That's all I can ask for.

11:50.231 --> 11:51.493
Thank you.

11:51.536 --> 11:53.321
I look forward
to working together.

11:53.364 --> 11:55.366
- It was nice to meet you,
Mr.--

11:55.410 --> 11:57.760
sorry, Dr. Shentu.

11:57.804 --> 11:59.936
- Randall. Please.

12:02.199 --> 12:03.331
One more thing.

12:03.374 --> 12:06.595
An ED resident upstaged Santa

12:06.638 --> 12:10.164
to announce that the ED
charge nurse was her mother?

12:10.207 --> 12:11.818
Do I have that right?

12:11.861 --> 12:15.343
- Dr. Vanessa Taylor
and Maggie Lockwood.

12:15.386 --> 12:18.172
- Wow, talk about left field.

12:18.215 --> 12:20.522
Can only imagine your surprise.

12:27.877 --> 12:28.051
.

12:28.095 --> 12:30.010
[gentle knocking]
- Hey, Luke.

12:30.053 --> 12:33.361
I'm Dr. Marcel. We met earlier.

12:33.404 --> 12:35.667
Luke, I'm gonna take
some blood from your arm.

12:35.711 --> 12:37.800
Gonna feel a little pinch,

12:37.844 --> 12:39.715
but before you know it,
we'll be all done, okay?

12:39.759 --> 12:41.195
- Where's my daddy?

12:41.238 --> 12:43.806
- He's in his treatment room
right across the way.

12:43.850 --> 12:46.200
- I see him.

12:46.243 --> 12:47.549
Sleeping.

12:47.592 --> 12:50.421
- That's right.

12:50.465 --> 12:52.162
- He's tired, honey.

12:52.206 --> 12:53.773
- I don't wanna be here.
- It's okay.

12:53.816 --> 12:56.645
- I understand. Ready to do it?

12:56.688 --> 12:58.255
- Mm-hmm.

12:58.299 --> 13:01.302
- Okay, Luke.
Can I see your arm?

13:01.345 --> 13:03.870
Here you go, bud.
I'm just gonna...

13:03.913 --> 13:06.524
roll your sleeve up, all right?
- Don't wanna.

13:06.568 --> 13:08.918
- We're almost there.

13:08.962 --> 13:10.485
- Cold.
- I know.

13:10.528 --> 13:12.922
I'll pull it right down
when I'm done, okay?

13:12.966 --> 13:14.794
Okay, this is a tourniquet.

13:14.837 --> 13:17.448
- No. Tight. It hurts.
Take it off.

13:17.492 --> 13:18.928
- I can't do that quite yet,
all right?

13:18.972 --> 13:20.103
Just hang in there
for me, okay?

13:20.147 --> 13:21.757
- I don't like it. It's cold.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.846
- Okay.

13:23.890 --> 13:25.195
- What's that?

13:25.239 --> 13:27.371
- This is just a wipe
to clean your arm.

13:27.415 --> 13:29.896
That's it. That's it.

13:31.201 --> 13:33.769
Just hang in there
for me, okay?

13:36.859 --> 13:38.905
- No shot! No shot!
I don't want a shot!

13:38.948 --> 13:41.124
Daddy!
- Right, need a hand?

13:41.168 --> 13:43.648
- No, no. Shutting it down.
That's it. We're done.

13:43.692 --> 13:44.867
All right, bud. We're done.

13:44.911 --> 13:46.956
- I want my daddy.
- Okay, all right.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.046
- Daddy!
- Come on, sweetie. Come on.

13:51.134 --> 13:52.788
- Saw your patient's chart.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.182
Wasn't that his best shot
at a kidney?

13:56.487 --> 13:58.228
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:58.272 --> 13:59.795
You got a plan B?

13:59.839 --> 14:01.841
- No.

14:04.147 --> 14:06.106
- Take a deep breath
for me, Claudia.

14:09.979 --> 14:11.415
Can you tell me what happened?

14:11.459 --> 14:12.895
- I was in class.

14:12.939 --> 14:14.418
I couldn't really concentrate.

14:14.462 --> 14:17.421
And my teacher let me
go to the water fountain.

14:17.465 --> 14:18.858
- Okay.

14:18.901 --> 14:20.250
Bilateral breath sounds,
heart's good,

14:20.294 --> 14:22.078
regular rate and rhythm.
No murmurs.

14:22.122 --> 14:23.558
- I was really thirsty

14:23.601 --> 14:25.647
but when I leaned over
to get a drink,

14:25.690 --> 14:27.127
I just got really dizzy

14:27.170 --> 14:29.390
and I fell and hit my head.

14:29.433 --> 14:31.871
- Did you lose consciousness?
- I don't know.

14:31.914 --> 14:33.437
I just remember
sitting on the floor

14:33.481 --> 14:36.310
with the school counselor,
Ms. Jones.

14:36.353 --> 14:39.879
- BNP, CBC, bolus a liter
of saline and a 12-lead EKG.

14:39.922 --> 14:41.532
- Is my mom coming?

14:41.576 --> 14:43.317
- I called her, no answer.

14:43.360 --> 14:44.492
I left a message.

14:44.535 --> 14:46.015
- We'll keep trying
your mom, Claudia.

14:46.059 --> 14:48.626
Be right back.

14:48.670 --> 14:49.932
- She okay?

14:49.976 --> 14:51.368
- Gonna run some tests
but all signs

14:51.412 --> 14:53.109
just point to Claudia
being dehydrated.

14:53.153 --> 14:55.242
- Oh, that's a relief.

14:55.285 --> 14:56.634
I've been worried
about her lately.

14:56.678 --> 15:00.073
Her grades have slipped,
absences have gone up.

15:00.116 --> 15:02.031
I tried reaching out
to her mom.

15:02.075 --> 15:04.947
We've been looking for a time
to sit down.

15:04.991 --> 15:06.427
This is Claudia's backpack.

15:06.470 --> 15:09.560
I know I shouldn't have
looked inside but I did.

15:10.866 --> 15:12.955
Found this.

15:12.999 --> 15:15.305
What are they?
- Furosemide.

15:15.349 --> 15:16.393
It's a diuretic.

15:16.437 --> 15:17.829
It's sometimes used
as a diet pill

15:17.873 --> 15:19.657
to lose water weight.

15:19.701 --> 15:21.137
"Sarah Rey?"

15:21.181 --> 15:23.270
- Claudia's mother.

15:25.489 --> 15:27.970
- Anel's cardiac labs
and EKG were normal

15:28.014 --> 15:29.450
so unlikely he blacked out.

15:29.493 --> 15:31.582
X-ray of his arm showed
a distal radius fracture.

15:31.626 --> 15:34.368
Page ortho.
Should be down soon to cast it.

15:34.411 --> 15:35.543
Is that his CT?

15:35.586 --> 15:38.154
- Not good.
Check out the hippocampus.

15:38.198 --> 15:41.027
- Diminished in size,
significant atrophy,

15:41.070 --> 15:42.854
but there's no evidence
of a bleed or stroke.

15:42.898 --> 15:44.334
- No.

15:44.378 --> 15:47.294
Makes me think
it could be Alzheimer's.

15:47.337 --> 15:49.600
Could explain the confusion
and the visual-spatial issues.

15:49.644 --> 15:52.516
- Yeah, but Anel's only 45.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.866
- Yeah, he might be
one of the 5 to 6%

15:54.910 --> 15:57.217
that develops symptoms early.

15:57.260 --> 15:59.349
Tell ortho to hold off
on casting the arm.

15:59.393 --> 16:02.222
Let's get
a neuro consult first.

16:02.265 --> 16:04.833
- Scott, need extra hands.

16:04.876 --> 16:06.313
- Keith Varig,
35-year-old male,

16:06.356 --> 16:08.054
unrestrained driver,
high-speed MVC.

16:08.097 --> 16:11.709
GCS 8, BP 100/60,
heart rate 124,

16:11.753 --> 16:13.842
grossly deformed left femur,
intubated in the ambo.

16:13.885 --> 16:15.713
Apparently, a truck kicked up
a rock on the Eisenhower,

16:15.757 --> 16:16.976
flew across the divider,

16:17.019 --> 16:18.455
smacked through
this guy's windshield,

16:18.499 --> 16:19.891
hit him in the head and
sent him right off the road.

16:19.935 --> 16:21.023
- Or somebody's got it in
for him.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.025
All right, come on. Let's go.

16:23.069 --> 16:25.462
All right.
Transfer on my count.

16:25.506 --> 16:27.769
One, two, three.

16:27.812 --> 16:30.380
Watch his bag. All right, good.

16:32.426 --> 16:35.037
- Multiple lacerations
to the face, neck, and arms.

16:35.081 --> 16:36.908
Likely closed femur fracture.

16:36.952 --> 16:39.955
- Belly's distended. I do not
like the way it feels either.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.349
Quick fast, please.

16:43.741 --> 16:45.047
- Bilateral breath sounds.

16:45.091 --> 16:47.006
Kathleen, let's set up
for a chest X-ray.

16:47.049 --> 16:49.008
- Free fluid
all over the belly.

16:49.051 --> 16:51.445
Heavy internal bleeding.
Vitals?

16:51.488 --> 16:55.579
- BPs dropping 90/55.
Heart rate's on the rise, 136.

16:55.623 --> 16:57.146
- Let's trigger the MTP.

16:57.190 --> 16:59.583
2 units blood,
2 units plasma, stat.

16:59.627 --> 17:00.758
- Clear.

17:00.802 --> 17:01.977
X-ray up.

17:03.848 --> 17:06.068
- Wow. Chest X-ray's clean.

17:06.112 --> 17:07.983
Lungs up, no hemothoraces.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.593
- Yeah, lucky us.
One less crisis.

17:09.637 --> 17:11.073
This guy's still
trying to die though.

17:11.117 --> 17:12.248
Okay, Hank, call the O.R.

17:12.292 --> 17:13.554
Tell 'em we're coming up.

17:13.597 --> 17:15.686
Come on.
Let's move, people. Let's go.

17:17.427 --> 17:20.082
- Look, my feeling just because
the ethics committee says

17:20.126 --> 17:22.041
we can use Luke as a donor

17:22.084 --> 17:23.868
doesn't mean we have to.

17:23.912 --> 17:25.479
- So there's another option?

17:25.522 --> 17:27.785
- It's not a great option
but yes.

17:27.829 --> 17:30.136
Peritoneal dialysis, PD.

17:30.179 --> 17:32.094
It's a slower type of dialysis,

17:32.138 --> 17:34.009
puts less strain
on the vascular system.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.228
- Slower.

17:35.271 --> 17:36.664
- Well, given your
clotting issues

17:36.707 --> 17:38.057
from regular hemodialysis,

17:38.100 --> 17:39.928
PD's the next best alternative

17:39.971 --> 17:41.582
until the kidney
becomes available.

17:42.670 --> 17:44.280
- [sighs]

17:44.324 --> 17:46.195
Doesn't sound too pleasant.

17:46.239 --> 17:49.807
- It's not but it buys time...

17:49.851 --> 17:52.636
to keep working
that transplant list, right?

17:58.338 --> 18:02.864
- This, uh, this PD, it--

18:02.907 --> 18:05.519
it won't involve Luke?

18:05.562 --> 18:06.694
Ever?

18:06.737 --> 18:08.696
- No.

18:10.350 --> 18:12.265
- Then let's do it.

18:18.314 --> 18:19.794
- Sharon.
- Yeah?

18:19.837 --> 18:21.317
- I just got a call from HR.

18:21.361 --> 18:23.363
They're asking me about
my relationship with Vanessa.

18:23.406 --> 18:24.799
What's this is all about?

18:24.842 --> 18:26.627
- Randall Shentu.
- Who?

18:26.670 --> 18:29.282
- Compliance officer
the board brought in.

18:31.414 --> 18:33.547
- You think they're gonna
call Vanessa in too?

18:33.590 --> 18:34.722
- I imagine so.

18:34.765 --> 18:36.724
- We were finally getting
to a good place.

18:36.767 --> 18:39.205
- I'm sorry, Maggie.

18:45.559 --> 18:47.865
- [groans]

18:47.909 --> 18:49.650
- Here. Is that better?

18:49.693 --> 18:51.173
- Uh, sure.

18:51.217 --> 18:54.524
- I'm sorry. Lawrence.
I know it's uncomfortable, man.

18:54.568 --> 18:55.873
- Dr. Marcel?
- Yeah.

18:55.917 --> 18:57.484
- Speak outside?

18:57.527 --> 19:00.008
- Yeah.

19:00.051 --> 19:02.141
I'll be right back.

19:04.969 --> 19:06.884
- Peritoneal dialysis.
- Yeah.

19:06.928 --> 19:09.191
- He's dying, Crockett.

19:09.235 --> 19:10.714
We had a path towards
possibly saving him

19:10.758 --> 19:11.889
and you've blown that up.

19:11.933 --> 19:13.543
- Luke couldn't handle
the blood draw.

19:13.587 --> 19:15.328
What happens
when it's time for surgery?

19:15.371 --> 19:16.546
That'd be torture.

19:16.590 --> 19:18.592
- We could help Luke
with his anxiety.

19:18.635 --> 19:20.202
- What? Sedate him
because we're inconvenienced

19:20.246 --> 19:22.073
by his emotions?
That's not a solution.

19:22.117 --> 19:25.207
- Neither is PD.
It's a stopgap at best.

Transplant organs

19:27.296 --> 19:28.384
Sometimes we have
to go get them.

19:28.428 --> 19:31.082
- Yeah, well, not like this.

19:31.126 --> 19:32.432
And Lawrence agrees.

19:34.608 --> 19:35.826
- Well, you better hope
that decision

19:35.870 --> 19:37.263
doesn't cost him his life.

about that later?

- Okay?

20:08.119 --> 20:12.080
Um, what did
the neurologist say?

20:12.123 --> 20:15.910
- It's his opinion
and ours as well

20:15.953 --> 20:19.740
that your father likely
has early-onset Alzheimer's.

20:21.568 --> 20:24.353

20:24.397 --> 20:27.269
Wow.

20:43.981 --> 20:48.116
how long until he's not
him anymore?

20:48.159 --> 20:49.248
- Hard to say.

20:49.291 --> 20:50.597
Likely a few years

20:50.640 --> 20:52.686
but maybe more,

20:52.729 --> 20:53.948
maybe less.

20:53.991 --> 20:55.210
- There are medications.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.734
One, Donepezil,
we'd like to start today.

20:57.778 --> 21:00.955
And going forward, neurology
will devise a treatment plan.

21:00.998 --> 21:03.218

21:03.262 --> 21:05.133
- No.

I'm sorry.

21:07.353 --> 21:08.963
With Alzheimer's,

21:09.006 --> 21:11.095

You sustained
incredible trauma.

21:56.402 --> 21:57.925
I've already

of your small intestine.

residency fair, correct?

22:24.734 --> 22:26.040
- Yes.

22:26.083 --> 22:28.390
But I spoke to many other
students that day,

22:28.434 --> 22:30.044
not just Dr. Taylor.

22:30.087 --> 22:31.219
- How many of those students

22:31.262 --> 22:33.090
are now employed
by the hospital?

22:35.745 --> 22:37.399
- None.
- Which makes it appear

22:37.443 --> 22:38.879
as if you had
an ulterior motive

22:38.922 --> 22:41.229
when you visited the fair
in the first place.

22:41.272 --> 22:44.014
- I wanted to meet my daughter.

- I don't want to call DCFS.

23:09.910 --> 23:11.390
- Okay.

23:11.433 --> 23:13.696
- Claudia passed out
because she was using diuretic

as diet pills,
mom's prescription.

23:16.177 --> 23:18.397
She says mom
gave 'em to her but

if that's true or not.

I mean, it's not a great look.

23:30.017 --> 23:31.453
- I mean, notifying them
might be protocol,

23:31.497 --> 23:35.588
but once that ball
gets rolling, it's--

look, I just want to get
mom's side of the story

23:42.682 --> 23:44.771
- Yeah. Okay.

23:44.814 --> 23:46.599
Uh, I'm gonna keep trying mom.

23:46.642 --> 23:49.253
And once she arrives,
do you mind talking to her?

23:49.297 --> 23:51.473
- Why don't we talk to
her together?

23:57.958 --> 24:00.003
- Okay, Keith.

24:00.047 --> 24:02.049
Let me scrub in and then
we're gonna get started.

24:03.920 --> 24:06.009
- I'm finally gonna
get what I deserve.

24:08.795 --> 24:10.666
Ten years ago,

24:10.710 --> 24:13.495
I was at a bar.

24:13.539 --> 24:16.324
I was drunk.

24:16.367 --> 24:19.501
A guy hit on me.

24:19.545 --> 24:22.809
I saw red.

24:22.852 --> 24:24.419
I punched him

24:24.463 --> 24:26.465
and I walked away.

24:28.031 --> 24:31.339
Later, I found out
that when he fell,

24:31.382 --> 24:34.429
he hit his head.

24:34.473 --> 24:37.040
He died.

24:38.564 --> 24:40.522
No one knew it was me

24:40.566 --> 24:42.611
so I didn't tell.

24:46.441 --> 24:49.096
I murdered a man.

24:49.139 --> 24:51.881
And now it's time to pay.

24:52.752 --> 24:54.884
A life for a life.

24:58.018 --> 24:59.498
- Everything all right?

25:01.238 --> 25:02.457
- Yeah, yeah.

25:02.501 --> 25:04.894
- Pushing meds,
20 of etomidate.

25:08.071 --> 25:09.769
- Oh, fun.

25:09.812 --> 25:12.336
Got another morning meeting
with the feds tomorrow.

25:12.380 --> 25:13.990
- Dr. Halstead, Dr. Hammer,

25:14.034 --> 25:15.905
I think something's up.

25:15.949 --> 25:18.517
I was just in Mr. Sanon's
treatment room.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.301
Overheard him
with this fiancée.

25:20.344 --> 25:23.304
I speak French so it's not
a one-to-one to Haitian Creole,

25:23.347 --> 25:25.219
but I'm pretty sure
he was explaining

25:25.262 --> 25:26.960
that his son said the fall

25:27.003 --> 25:29.049
was just a balance issue.

25:29.092 --> 25:31.573
That meds called
Donepezil will take care of it.

25:31.617 --> 25:33.662
- Emmanuel didn't tell
his father.

25:33.706 --> 25:35.403
- Yeah, looks that way.

25:35.446 --> 25:37.013
- Nancy, do you know
where Emmanuel is?

25:37.057 --> 25:38.667
- Waiting room.

25:41.583 --> 25:44.630
- I didn't tell him
and I'm not going to.

25:44.673 --> 25:46.545
- Emmanuel,

25:46.588 --> 25:47.981
I know Alzheimer's
was not the news

25:48.024 --> 25:49.765
that you were expecting today.

25:49.809 --> 25:50.897
I'm so sorry.

25:50.940 --> 25:52.202
But lying to your father
is just--

25:52.246 --> 25:55.031
- I'm protecting him.

25:55.075 --> 25:56.337
You can't understand.

25:56.380 --> 25:58.121
In Haiti, all my father knew

25:58.165 --> 26:01.908
was poverty, hardship, and war.

26:01.951 --> 26:06.260
But now there's freedom,
joy, love.

26:06.303 --> 26:09.089
He finally
has everything to live for.

26:09.132 --> 26:11.178
And I won't take that from him.

26:11.221 --> 26:14.050
- Emmanuel,
the disease will progress

26:14.094 --> 26:15.791
so you--you can't keep it
a secret forever anyway.

26:15.835 --> 26:17.706
- Why not?

26:17.750 --> 26:21.014
Let my father live
a few years in ignorant bliss.

26:21.057 --> 26:22.624
When the time does come,

26:22.668 --> 26:27.411
he won't even remember
this day happened.

26:27.455 --> 26:29.326
Please.

26:36.072 --> 26:38.292
- No. No way.

26:38.335 --> 26:39.641
Anel should be
the one to decide

26:39.685 --> 26:41.164
what's best for his life,

26:41.208 --> 26:42.601
especially when there's
a time clock on it.

26:42.644 --> 26:44.951
- When the truth
may do more harm than good,

26:44.994 --> 26:48.215
therapeutic privilege gives us
some leeway to hold back info.

26:48.258 --> 26:49.782
I mean, plus I imagine

26:49.825 --> 26:52.959
Emmanuel knows his father
better than anyone.

26:53.002 --> 26:54.482
We should consider his opinion.

26:54.525 --> 26:57.267
- Is it his opinion or yours?

26:57.311 --> 26:58.791
Seems these days,
you're the one who's in charge

26:58.834 --> 27:02.098
of what people should
or rather shouldn't know.

27:12.239 --> 27:12.631
.

27:12.674 --> 27:15.242
- Fabienne doesn't know either,
does she?

27:15.285 --> 27:17.548
Keeping the diagnosis secret
affects her life too.

27:17.592 --> 27:19.115
- I'm doing
what I think is right.

27:19.159 --> 27:20.377
- Okay, Emmanuel,

27:20.421 --> 27:21.509
I get that you want to preserve

27:21.552 --> 27:23.119
your father's happiness

27:23.163 --> 27:25.165
but he and Fabienne
are engaged.

27:25.208 --> 27:26.862
She needs to know
her future may not be

27:26.906 --> 27:29.473
what she's envisioning.

27:29.517 --> 27:31.519
Please tell her.

27:33.739 --> 27:35.523
- So Claudia's gonna be okay?

27:35.566 --> 27:37.917
- Yes. Her latest labs
came back normal.

27:37.960 --> 27:39.222
Small bruise on her forehead

27:39.266 --> 27:41.703
but she's now hydrated
and feeling much better.

27:41.747 --> 27:43.923
- I had my cell in my pocket,
but I was on shift.

27:43.966 --> 27:45.141
There's a strict phone policy.

27:45.185 --> 27:46.708
I didn't know
it was the hospital.

27:46.752 --> 27:49.668
- Don't worry about it.
We, um, we found you

27:49.711 --> 27:52.801
and you're here
and that's what's important.

27:52.845 --> 27:56.675
- Um, Claudia told me
that you gave these to her.

28:03.029 --> 28:05.205
- I've struggled with my weight
my entire life.

28:05.248 --> 28:07.511
I was raised on fast food
and huge portions.

28:07.555 --> 28:09.209
And before I knew it,

28:09.252 --> 28:11.864
I was raising Claudia
the same way.

28:11.907 --> 28:14.649
I tried to break the cycle
with lean recipes,

28:14.693 --> 28:15.781
meal prep, organic,

28:15.824 --> 28:18.566
but I--I work two jobs

28:18.609 --> 28:20.002
and can barely make rent.

28:20.046 --> 28:22.178
Eating right
takes planning and money.

28:22.222 --> 28:24.267
- Must be frustrating
feeling like,

28:24.311 --> 28:26.443
you know, all those--
all those healthy options

28:26.487 --> 28:29.925
are not available to you.

28:29.969 --> 28:33.059
So could you tell us
about the pills?

28:34.756 --> 28:36.802
- I found them on the internet.

28:37.759 --> 28:39.674
I was just trying
to get to spring

28:39.718 --> 28:41.589
and nicer weather
so we could walk again.

28:41.632 --> 28:43.460
- Right.

28:43.504 --> 28:45.332
- I've been Claudia,

28:45.375 --> 28:47.203
the overweight teenager,

28:47.247 --> 28:48.378
and kids can be cruel,

28:48.422 --> 28:50.032
especially when you get
to high school

28:50.076 --> 28:52.556
and I just wanted to spare her
that pain but I'm failing.

28:52.600 --> 28:55.037
- No, I don't see that.

28:55.081 --> 28:56.560
I see a mom

28:56.604 --> 28:58.780
who's doing the best
that she can.

28:58.824 --> 29:00.956
- You know, we have
a couple of excellent

29:01.000 --> 29:02.566
educational programs
here at the hospital.

29:02.610 --> 29:07.746
The one I'm thinking about,
Exercise and Nutrition,

29:07.789 --> 29:10.052
both online and in-person.

29:10.096 --> 29:12.141
Is that something you think
you might be interested in?

29:12.185 --> 29:13.316
- Yes. Thank you.

29:13.360 --> 29:15.884
- I can put together
some info for you.

29:15.928 --> 29:17.407
- Can I go back
and be with Claudia now?

29:17.451 --> 29:19.279
- Yeah, of course.

29:19.322 --> 29:21.368
It was very nice
to meet you, Ms. Rey.

29:24.937 --> 29:28.854
- So, holding off on DCFS,

29:28.897 --> 29:30.681
that was the right call.

29:30.725 --> 29:33.423
- Mothers and daughters have
been on my mind a lot lately.

29:33.467 --> 29:36.644
- Well, came in handy today.

29:36.687 --> 29:39.995
Good work, Doctor. Keep it up.

29:40.039 --> 29:42.128
- Thanks.

29:47.698 --> 29:50.005
- Fabienne?

29:50.049 --> 29:51.877
Hi.

29:51.920 --> 29:54.227
I'm Doctor Hammer.

29:55.184 --> 29:59.188
I'm hoping Emmanuel told you
about Anel's diagnosis?

29:59.232 --> 30:00.755
- Yes.

30:00.799 --> 30:03.453
It was a shock.

30:03.497 --> 30:07.457
- I understand.

30:07.501 --> 30:09.285
I want to respect your space

30:09.329 --> 30:13.550
and I apologize
for overstepping...

30:13.594 --> 30:18.338
but Emmanuel has chosen
not to tell his father.

30:18.381 --> 30:20.688
How do you feel about that?

30:22.777 --> 30:25.258
- Conflicted.

30:25.301 --> 30:27.347
I love Anel.

30:27.390 --> 30:29.697
Keeping a secret from him
is not the way

30:29.740 --> 30:31.481
I want to begin our marriage,

30:31.525 --> 30:37.661
but I agree with Emmanuel
that he doesn't need to know.

30:37.705 --> 30:41.796
- Oh. Really?

30:41.840 --> 30:44.755
- Anel is reunited
with his son.

30:44.799 --> 30:47.889
His world, at last,
is at peace.

30:47.933 --> 30:50.022
Telling him it's only
a fleeting moment

30:50.065 --> 30:54.417
will destroy him
far faster than the disease.

30:54.461 --> 30:58.073
That's not the marriage
I want either.

30:58.117 --> 31:01.860
I support Emmanuel's decision.

31:01.903 --> 31:05.254
- But he's made it
for both of you.

31:05.298 --> 31:06.342
That's not fair.

31:06.386 --> 31:08.649
- It won't be easy,
I understand,

31:08.692 --> 31:12.044
but I'm prepared.

31:13.610 --> 31:15.221
- In our culture,

31:15.264 --> 31:18.398
nothing is more important
than family.

31:18.441 --> 31:23.794
Emmanuel knows this because
his father instilled it in him.

31:23.838 --> 31:27.494
What's not fair,
even more than the diagnosis,

31:27.537 --> 31:34.066
is that Anel will never know
what Emmanuel is doing for him.

31:34.109 --> 31:38.026
He would be proud of his son.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.603
- The damage was extensive.

31:49.646 --> 31:53.215
It was a very difficult
surgery.

31:53.259 --> 31:58.699
We couldn't awaken Keith
after the surgery and...

31:58.742 --> 32:00.048
we gave him a CT,

32:00.092 --> 32:01.920
found that he had suffered
a hemorrhagic stroke

32:01.963 --> 32:04.574
while he was on the table.

32:04.618 --> 32:07.229
- He's not gonna wake up?

32:07.273 --> 32:09.797
- There are no
brainstem reflexes.

32:09.840 --> 32:12.452
Neurology will run
an apnea test to confirm

32:12.495 --> 32:17.718
but the stroke was massive
and catastrophic.

32:17.761 --> 32:19.763
- Keith's gone?

32:19.807 --> 32:21.809
- I'm very sorry.

32:23.332 --> 32:28.424
- Keith spoke to me
before he went under.

32:28.468 --> 32:31.645
- What did he say?

32:31.688 --> 32:35.649
- Well, he said...

32:35.692 --> 32:37.042
that if he were to die,

32:37.085 --> 32:39.479
he would want his organs
to be donated.

32:43.178 --> 32:44.049
- Yes.

32:44.092 --> 32:45.485
Yes, we'll donate.

32:50.359 --> 32:51.621
- Um...

32:51.665 --> 32:53.972
if you'd like to spend
some time with Keith.

33:04.808 --> 33:06.201
- Damn, man.

33:06.245 --> 33:09.030
That's what he was saying?

33:09.074 --> 33:11.598
- His exact words:

33:11.641 --> 33:13.513
"a life for a life."

33:24.089 --> 33:26.743
- Well, my plan B
isn't working.

33:26.787 --> 33:29.268
- Well then, new plan.

33:29.311 --> 33:31.139
Got a patient on life support,

33:31.183 --> 33:32.793
no chance of recovery,

33:32.836 --> 33:34.447
blood type O-neg.

33:34.490 --> 33:37.145
Kidneys being HLA tested
right now.

33:37.189 --> 33:40.018
Here are the preliminary
numbers.

33:40.061 --> 33:42.324
The family's agreed
to direct organ donation.

33:42.368 --> 33:45.893
If the kidney matches
your patient, it's yours.

33:45.936 --> 33:47.808
- Yeah, I think this'll work.

33:47.851 --> 33:49.418
- Okay.

33:58.558 --> 33:58.775
.

33:58.819 --> 34:00.473
- Look, I should've
run PD by you

34:00.516 --> 34:01.952
before making the switch.

34:01.996 --> 34:03.737
You're right.
It was a Hail Mary

34:03.780 --> 34:06.087
and it could've ended badly.

34:06.131 --> 34:08.481
I get it if after today you
want to drop me from your team.

34:08.524 --> 34:10.309
- Not drop you, Crockett,

34:10.352 --> 34:12.311
strangle you.

34:12.354 --> 34:13.877
- Mm.

34:13.921 --> 34:16.271
- The truth is
I believe in you.

34:16.315 --> 34:18.882
Hell, I even like you.

34:18.926 --> 34:21.276
Maybe that's because
you piss me off.

34:21.320 --> 34:23.322
- Thank you.

34:23.365 --> 34:24.845
I guess.

34:24.888 --> 34:26.325
- Look,
I'm not opposed to you

34:26.368 --> 34:28.979
wearing your heart
on your sleeve,

34:29.023 --> 34:31.765
but you and I are strongest
when we work together,

34:31.808 --> 34:33.462
got it?

34:33.506 --> 34:36.204
- Got it.

34:36.248 --> 34:37.901
And I like you too.

34:39.729 --> 34:41.601
- Let's go save
Lawrence's life.

34:47.215 --> 34:49.783
- Vanessa.

34:49.826 --> 34:51.393
I've been looking for you.

34:51.437 --> 34:55.745
- Sorry,
I'm just taking a moment.

34:59.923 --> 35:02.839
- I had to sit down
with HR today.

35:05.277 --> 35:08.280
They're digging into

35:08.323 --> 35:14.460
how I met you and ultimately
how you ended up in Med.

35:14.503 --> 35:17.289
I'm so sorry.

35:17.332 --> 35:20.727
I keep on getting in the way.

35:20.770 --> 35:23.425
I never wanted
to be a distraction.

35:25.471 --> 35:27.429
But over and over, that's--

35:27.473 --> 35:32.217
that's what I've been.

35:32.260 --> 35:34.219
Anyway, uh,

35:34.262 --> 35:37.265
they're probably
gonna reach out.

35:37.309 --> 35:40.138
- I don't care.

35:40.181 --> 35:41.835
Let HR call.

35:44.446 --> 35:46.274
- You're not upset?

35:46.318 --> 35:48.058
- You know, when--

35:48.102 --> 35:52.280
when I first started at Med, I
was just--

35:52.324 --> 35:54.674
I was just so intimidated.

35:54.717 --> 35:57.416
The early hours,
the ten-year binder,

35:57.459 --> 36:01.420
the...Adderall, that was--

36:01.463 --> 36:04.640
that was just me trying
not to feel like an imposter.

36:04.684 --> 36:07.252
Like I belong.

36:07.295 --> 36:10.255
But I know now I do belong.

36:10.298 --> 36:12.605
And I wouldn't have figured
that out if it weren't for you.

36:12.648 --> 36:15.608
All you've been is supportive.

36:19.307 --> 36:20.265
- I don't know what to say.

36:20.308 --> 36:22.571
- You don't have
to say anything.

36:24.617 --> 36:28.751
Just know that I am so grateful

36:28.795 --> 36:31.319
that you're in my life.

36:31.363 --> 36:34.540
I don't care who knows.

36:38.021 --> 36:40.763
- You know,
when I went to the FBI,

36:40.807 --> 36:44.289
I really thought I was
doing right by this hospital.

36:44.332 --> 36:46.116
And now, I don't know.

36:46.160 --> 36:47.161
- Whoa, whoa, hold on.

36:47.205 --> 36:49.250
For what it's worth,
I, for one,

36:49.294 --> 36:51.818
am absolutely positive
that you did the right thing.

36:51.861 --> 36:53.472
- I appreciate that.

36:53.515 --> 36:55.604
- So positive in fact,

36:55.648 --> 36:57.302
that I am gonna take you out

36:57.345 --> 37:00.696
for an incredibly expensive
dinner right now.

37:02.785 --> 37:05.266
Let's go.
- [chuckles]

37:21.239 --> 37:22.849
- Just so you know,

37:22.892 --> 37:24.894
the Vas-COM business,
sneaking around,

37:24.938 --> 37:26.853
playing nice with the enemy,
it sucked,

37:26.896 --> 37:29.464
but I needed
to protect patients.

37:29.508 --> 37:31.684
I had to help.

37:31.727 --> 37:33.860
And if I had to do it again,
I would.

37:33.903 --> 37:36.428
So I'm sorry
I didn't fill you in.

37:36.471 --> 37:38.038
I wish I could have.

37:38.081 --> 37:41.171
- No, you were doing
what you thought was right.

37:41.215 --> 37:42.956
Yeah, I get that now.

37:44.740 --> 37:49.267
- So we're cool?
- Yeah, we're cool.

37:49.310 --> 37:50.833
Um, hey.

37:50.877 --> 37:53.923
The device rep, Jessa,

37:53.967 --> 37:57.449
did you sleep with her to get
the information you needed?

37:57.492 --> 37:59.364
- No.

37:59.407 --> 38:01.148
Absolutely not.

38:01.191 --> 38:02.584
- Good.

38:16.772 --> 38:18.687
- Congratulations.

38:18.731 --> 38:20.776
Another W.

38:20.820 --> 38:22.996
- Thanks to your
11th-hour heroics.

38:25.825 --> 38:27.957
You saved us
from an impossible choice.

38:29.263 --> 38:31.918
Deus Ex Machina.

38:31.961 --> 38:36.444
- Dues--
oh, "god from the machine."

38:36.488 --> 38:42.885
I like that.

38:42.929 --> 38:44.670
Goodnight, Pamela.

38:44.713 --> 38:47.063
- Night, Dean.

38:53.461 --> 38:55.550
- Crockett.

38:55.594 --> 38:58.118
- Avery, hey.
What? Another follow-up?

38:58.161 --> 39:00.033
- No, I'm working here
just like you.

39:00.076 --> 39:01.774
- Oh.
- My firm's been meeting

39:01.817 --> 39:03.776
with patients and families
affected by the Vas-COM.

39:03.819 --> 39:05.821
- Oh, that's right.
Well, you got a case?

39:05.865 --> 39:07.562
- Oh, yeah. Good one.

39:07.606 --> 39:08.911
- Nice.
- Speaking of,

39:08.955 --> 39:11.566
my mom filled me in
on your big win.

39:11.610 --> 39:13.438
- Ah.
- Way to kick ass.

39:13.481 --> 39:15.570
- You say so.

39:15.614 --> 39:18.573
- Are you refusing to
pat yourself on the back, huh?

39:18.617 --> 39:21.054
That's pretty sexy.

39:21.097 --> 39:23.230
What do you say,
dinner then my place?

39:23.273 --> 39:26.102
- Oh, not tonight.

39:26.146 --> 39:27.277
- Yeah.

39:27.321 --> 39:28.496
Yeah, sure. I get it.

39:28.540 --> 39:30.542
Single in the city.
I know how it works.

39:30.585 --> 39:32.195
- Yeah.

39:33.327 --> 39:36.678
- Well, okay.

39:36.722 --> 39:38.376
I'll see you around.

39:38.419 --> 39:41.074
- Yeah, see you around.

39:45.687 --> 39:48.255
- So what are you thinking?

39:48.298 --> 39:49.299
- I don't know.

39:49.343 --> 39:51.824
The duck, gnocchi,

39:51.867 --> 39:53.129
Spanish octopus.

39:53.173 --> 39:56.872
- Mm, you got
a tough decision to make.

39:56.916 --> 39:58.657
Me on the other hand,
I have no such issue.

39:58.700 --> 39:59.745
- The Wagyu strip.

39:59.788 --> 40:02.443
- How'd you know?
- [laughs]

40:05.664 --> 40:09.450
What about the--
the tasting menu?

40:09.494 --> 40:11.017
- Ms. Cooper.

40:11.060 --> 40:12.235
I'm actually glad
I ran into you.

40:12.279 --> 40:13.846
There's something
I've been wanting to say.

40:13.889 --> 40:15.848
- I'm not interested.

40:17.806 --> 40:20.287
- You come at me
as hard as you want, okay?

40:20.330 --> 40:21.636
It doesn't matter.
- Come on.

40:21.680 --> 40:23.159
- I'm gonna win.
You're gonna lose.

40:23.203 --> 40:24.509
- This is neither
the time or the place,

40:24.552 --> 40:25.510
all right?
- That's it.

40:25.553 --> 40:27.860
Enjoy your dinner.
