Hey!

01:17.775 --> 01:19.175
And if we just,
like, download it,

01:19.177 --> 01:20.910
it would be a lot easier
than if you stream it.

01:20.912 --> 01:22.481
You know?
That's what I've learned.

01:32.824 --> 01:34.192
What's going on?

01:41.532 --> 01:42.831
Wakey-wakey!

01:42.833 --> 01:46.101
It is I,
the inflated destroyer,

01:46.103 --> 01:48.038
Balloon Man!

02:04.422 --> 02:07.592
Time to inflate
my bank account.

02:16.902 --> 02:18.035
Hello.

02:28.747 --> 02:30.315
Aah!

02:59.643 --> 03:01.079
Titans, go!

03:11.487 --> 03:13.555
Oh, yeah! Scabadoosh!

03:14.692 --> 03:15.990
Booyah!

03:20.463 --> 03:21.631
Ha-ha!

03:21.633 --> 03:23.765
Who wants a balloon animal?

03:26.270 --> 03:27.939
Kitties!

03:50.027 --> 03:52.297
Stop hitting yourself.
Stop hitting yourself.

03:55.032 --> 03:57.802
I'mma pop you, fool!

04:19.457 --> 04:20.555
Oh!

04:21.625 --> 04:22.857
He farted!

04:22.859 --> 04:24.126
That wasn't a fart.

04:24.128 --> 04:26.528
That was just air
leaving my butt.

04:26.530 --> 04:27.763
Which is a fart.

04:29.834 --> 04:33.301
Shut up! You guys are
awfully immature for the Justice League.

04:33.303 --> 04:36.838
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Do we look
like the Justice League to you?

04:36.840 --> 04:37.972
I don't know.

04:37.974 --> 04:39.174
I thought you were maybe

04:39.176 --> 04:41.010
some of
the lesser-known members.

04:41.012 --> 04:42.311
This fool thinks
we're in the Justice League?

04:42.313 --> 04:43.746
Man, we ain't
no Justice League.

04:43.748 --> 04:45.047
I recognize you now.

04:45.049 --> 04:47.616
You are
the Guardians of the Galaxy!

04:49.020 --> 04:50.919
Uh, that's a different
superhero universe.

04:50.921 --> 04:52.722
I am the insulted.

04:52.724 --> 04:55.424
All right, all right.
Then who are you?

04:55.426 --> 04:59.095
Yo, Cy. This guy
don't know who we is.

04:59.097 --> 05:03.231

it's time we tell him.

You're too late.

06:47.304 --> 06:50.939
Our song was so sick,
it took down Balloon Man.

06:50.941 --> 06:52.441
Sure it did.

06:52.443 --> 06:55.544
Since you came all this way,
you guys wanna hang?

06:55.546 --> 06:57.712
Yeah, well, we'd love to,

06:57.714 --> 06:59.782
but we gotta get
to Batman's movie premiere.

06:59.784 --> 07:03.919
It's always been
my dream to have my own movie.

07:03.921 --> 07:06.955
Well, it is important
to have dreams, I guess.

07:06.957 --> 07:08.657
What do you mean by that?

07:08.659 --> 07:12.561
Well, you know, they only make
movies about real heroes.

07:12.563 --> 07:17.032
I am a real hero. I even
have my own superhero team.

07:17.034 --> 07:19.099
You guys are goofsters.

07:19.101 --> 07:20.970
You know, with the farts.

07:20.972 --> 07:22.470
Always cracking your jokes.

07:22.472 --> 07:24.606
You mean, people
think we're jokes?

07:24.608 --> 07:26.909
Why do you think there's never
been a movie made about you?

07:26.911 --> 07:29.578
Well, has there been
a movie about you?

07:29.580 --> 07:31.380
So many. And more to come.

07:31.382 --> 07:34.083
It took a while, but yeah,
I have my own now.

07:34.085 --> 07:37.953
There was a Green Lantern movie.
But we don't talk about that.

07:37.955 --> 07:41.890
Problem is, you guys are never
actually doing anything heroic.

07:41.892 --> 07:43.525
Man, please. That ain't true.

07:43.527 --> 07:46.061
What about that time we
discovered that sweet diner?

07:46.063 --> 07:47.962
And they had that food?

07:47.964 --> 07:50.431
Oh, yes. It was most delicious.

07:50.433 --> 07:53.635
That wasn't even a crime
and you didn't save anything.

07:53.637 --> 07:55.970
This guy thinks
we didn't save anything.

07:55.972 --> 07:58.273
We saved room for dessert!

07:58.275 --> 08:00.441
Right in your face!

08:00.443 --> 08:02.578
Titans, if you keep
playing the fool,

08:02.580 --> 08:05.047
you'll never be seen
as real heroes.

08:05.049 --> 08:06.881
Only as jokes.

08:08.318 --> 08:09.518
- Got him!
- Somebody save me.

08:09.520 --> 08:12.121
Anyway, we gotta
get going. Ta-ta!

08:12.123 --> 08:13.722
Is it true?

08:13.724 --> 08:16.558
Are we not the real heroes?

08:16.560 --> 08:19.895
Of course we are.
We just took down Balloon Man.

08:19.897 --> 08:22.797
I believe we have
a premiere to attend.

08:22.799 --> 08:24.566
<i>Teen Titans, go...</i>

08:24.568 --> 08:26.137
<i>To the movies!</i>

08:34.477 --> 08:36.613
Batman! Batman!

08:38.082 --> 08:39.683
Superman, over here!

08:44.420 --> 08:46.522
Supergirl, who are you
wearing tonight?

08:46.524 --> 08:47.790
Plastic Man.

08:47.792 --> 08:50.225
Hey, John, how are you?

08:50.227 --> 08:52.094
- <i>Over here!</i>
- <i>Show us the bracelets!</i>

08:53.963 --> 08:55.196
Oops. My bad.

08:55.198 --> 08:58.568
The Atom has arrived.
Thank you!

08:59.437 --> 09:00.835
Behold...

09:01.904 --> 09:03.471
Behold, Titans!

09:03.473 --> 09:06.941
This is every
superhero's dream,

09:06.943 --> 09:09.713
to have your own movie!

09:10.614 --> 09:14.449
This burrito is my dream.

09:14.451 --> 09:18.353
Titans, are you ready
to walk the red carpet?

09:18.355 --> 09:20.055
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, yes! I'm ready.

09:20.057 --> 09:21.122
Let's go in!

09:30.500 --> 09:31.966
Hold it.

09:31.968 --> 09:34.869
This premiere is for superheroes only.
Who are you?

09:34.871 --> 09:37.205
Who are we?

09:37.207 --> 09:38.974
Who are we?

09:38.976 --> 09:41.276
This fool don't know
who's we is.

09:41.278 --> 09:43.545
Perhaps this will remind you?

09:43.547 --> 09:45.814
<i>♪ Teen Teen Titans
The Titans, the Teen Titans ♪</i>

09:45.816 --> 09:48.282
Stop! You're not on the list.

09:48.284 --> 09:50.786
But we're superheroes.

09:50.788 --> 09:52.120
Hello.

09:52.122 --> 09:53.654
We're the Challengers
of the Unknown.

09:53.656 --> 09:56.325
We're here
for the motion picture.

09:56.327 --> 09:58.827
Challengers, Challengers.
Ooh! Right this way.

09:58.829 --> 10:02.163
The Challengers of the Unknown
are on the list?

10:02.165 --> 10:03.965
That is the obscure.

10:03.967 --> 10:06.435
No one knows them!
They's unknown!

10:06.437 --> 10:09.707
It's in the name. "Unknown."
It's in the name!

10:14.145 --> 10:16.912
Man! How's we
supposed to get in now?

10:16.914 --> 10:19.949
I do have the ability to open
portals to any feasible location.

10:19.951 --> 10:22.283
- Oh, yes!
- That's right. I always forget about that.

10:22.285 --> 10:23.553
Portal it is!

10:40.303 --> 10:42.170
Oh, man. There's no seats.

10:42.172 --> 10:43.705
What about those?

10:43.707 --> 10:46.874
I can hardly wait for the
motion picture to begin.

10:46.876 --> 10:49.644
But that's where the Challengers
of the Unknown are sitting.

10:49.646 --> 10:51.745
Dude, no one's
gonna miss them.

10:51.747 --> 10:53.382
Yeah! They's unknown!

10:53.384 --> 10:55.618
Exactly.

10:55.620 --> 10:59.620
Challengers, we seem to be drifting
in a void of complete darkness.

10:59.622 --> 11:04.792
Nothing waits for us here
but madness. Madness!

11:04.794 --> 11:07.963
<i>Super-ladies and

All right!

11:17.808 --> 11:20.207
Who's ready to watch
a Batman movie?

11:21.678 --> 11:25.116
Give it up
for the Bat himself.

11:26.683 --> 11:27.882
No, you deserve it.

11:27.884 --> 11:30.218
Yes, you do. Yes, you do.

11:30.220 --> 11:32.253
Batman!

11:33.658 --> 11:37.658
You know who else deserves it?
All of you!

11:39.630 --> 11:41.931
It doesn't matter
how obscure you are.

11:41.933 --> 11:43.998
You're all getting a movie!

11:44.000 --> 11:46.502
You want a little sneak peek?

<i>...emerges a hero.</i>

11:53.244 --> 11:55.480
They're finally going to make
a movie about me!

11:57.180 --> 11:59.249
Alfred The Movie.

12:00.116 --> 12:02.252
<i>The ultimate grime fighter.</i>

12:06.122 --> 12:07.523
<i>When the dust settles,</i>

12:07.525 --> 12:10.461

will be left dusting.</i>

12:12.228 --> 12:13.628
<i>Coming broom.</i>

12:14.799 --> 12:16.197
Don't worry, brah.

12:16.199 --> 12:18.933
If Alfred got a movie,
you must be next.

12:18.935 --> 12:22.237
Right. My movie must
be slated for next summer.

12:22.239 --> 12:24.406
<i>Coming next summer.</i>

12:24.408 --> 12:26.707

<i>It's the car.</i>

12:30.814 --> 12:33.382
Oh! They did the car
before you, bro.

12:33.384 --> 12:35.282
This is ridiculous!

12:35.284 --> 12:38.253
<i>Batmobile The Movie.</i>

- I'd go see it.

12:41.324 --> 12:42.957
I do love
the Batman's automobile.

12:42.959 --> 12:45.194
They must be saving the best
for last then.

12:45.196 --> 12:47.463
I'm sure my movie
is next, next summer.

12:47.465 --> 12:49.297

movie was about him!

13:20.597 --> 13:23.266
- He's just a sidekick.
- He's a nobody.

13:24.467 --> 13:26.234
Sidekick! Sidekick!

13:46.390 --> 13:49.391
Aw, man. Forget those fools.

13:49.393 --> 13:51.124
Who cares what
other people think?

13:51.126 --> 13:54.930
We have the each other
and that is all that matters.

13:54.932 --> 13:56.532
Star's right, bro.

13:56.534 --> 13:58.566
What do those big-shot
superheroes know anyway?

13:58.568 --> 14:02.604
They know having a movie is the
only way to be seen as a real hero.

14:02.606 --> 14:05.239
You are the real hero to us.

14:05.241 --> 14:06.907
Yeah. You put
this team together.

14:06.909 --> 14:09.009
Without you,
we'd be all alone.

14:09.011 --> 14:10.811
That's right.

14:10.813 --> 14:13.349
Without you, bro, I'd be living
in a dumpster eating garbage.

14:14.952 --> 14:16.984
<i>And I'd have
to enslave entire dimensions</i>

14:16.986 --> 14:18.920
<i>with my evil dad.</i>

14:18.922 --> 14:20.788
<i>And I would be forced
to return to my life of fighting</i>

14:20.790 --> 14:23.758
<i>in the pit of
the intergalactic gladiator.</i>

14:23.760 --> 14:25.994
<i>And I'd be playing
professional football.</i>

14:25.996 --> 14:28.529
<i>It sounds good, but you're
forgetting the concussions.</i>

14:28.531 --> 14:30.465
<i>The bad knees, going broke,</i>

14:30.467 --> 14:32.903
<i>and having to be on one of those
awful dance reality TV shows!</i>

14:34.005 --> 14:35.903
But why don't they
take us seriously?

14:35.905 --> 14:39.407
We've got the cool costumes,
gadgets, and the powers,

14:39.409 --> 14:42.143
and the sweet kung-fu moves.
Ooh-hah!

14:42.145 --> 14:43.311
What are we missing?

14:43.313 --> 14:45.479
Well, what about
an archnemesis?

14:45.481 --> 14:47.349
An archnemesis?

14:47.351 --> 14:50.686
Oh, yeah. An archnemesis is like a
status symbol in the hero world.

14:50.688 --> 14:53.053
Yeah, bro.
Every superhero's got one.

14:53.055 --> 14:56.758
Super bad dudes
with super scary names.

14:56.760 --> 14:59.960
That are fun to say
in a dramatic way.

14:59.962 --> 15:01.329
Superman's got

15:01.331 --> 15:03.598
Lex Luthor!

15:03.600 --> 15:06.600
Ooh! Lex Luthor.

15:06.602 --> 15:09.970
Green Lantern's got Sinestro.

15:09.972 --> 15:11.773
Ooh! Sinestro.

15:11.775 --> 15:16.210
And the Flash has
the Rainbow Raider!

15:16.212 --> 15:20.114
He rides upon the rainbows!

15:20.116 --> 15:22.050
That is pretty scary.

15:22.052 --> 15:24.819
If you can get a crazed lunatic to
devote himself to taking you down,

15:24.821 --> 15:26.922
it means you
really are a top hero.

15:26.924 --> 15:29.224
You know, the kind they make
movies about.

15:29.226 --> 15:31.058
How do we get an archnemesis?

15:32.228 --> 15:33.894
It's a crime alert.

15:33.896 --> 15:35.196
A crime alert?

15:35.198 --> 15:37.699
A mysterious figure
breaking into S.T.A.R. Labs.

15:37.701 --> 15:41.034
This could be it.
The key to a movie about me!

15:41.036 --> 15:44.775
Titans, let's go get ourselves
an archnemesis.

16:22.045 --> 16:24.211
The Justice League
will stop you.

16:24.213 --> 16:29.053
Sorry, my pathetic friend, but the
Justice League won't be coming.

16:31.621 --> 16:33.821
Because they're
watching a movie.

16:33.823 --> 16:36.423
And as considerate moviegoers, I'm sure they
would've turned off their mobile devices.

16:36.425 --> 16:38.428
Unlike some people.

16:43.299 --> 16:45.133
The Ditronium Crystal.

16:45.135 --> 16:47.538
The perfect plot device.

16:53.175 --> 16:55.344
Stop right there,

16:55.346 --> 16:56.744
Deadpool?

16:56.746 --> 16:58.946
Deadpool? What?
I'm not Deadpool.

16:58.948 --> 17:00.882
I thought Deadpool
was a good guy.

17:00.884 --> 17:02.517
Why does everybody
think I'm Deadpool?

17:02.519 --> 17:03.651
You got them guns!

17:03.653 --> 17:05.185
And the swords.

17:05.188 --> 17:07.288
Yeah, well, lots of people
have guns and swords, okay?

17:07.290 --> 17:09.424
On the way here, I passed, like,
25 people with guns and swords.

17:09.425 --> 17:12.060
By the way, he should be
saying that he's not me, okay?

17:12.061 --> 17:14.396
'Cause I came out, like,
way before he did.

17:14.397 --> 17:16.030
Nah. I'm pretty sure
you're Deadpool.

17:16.031 --> 17:18.330
Look into the camera and say
something inappropriate.

17:18.333 --> 17:20.034
Oh, I'm not Deadpool.

17:20.036 --> 17:21.336
I am the greatest,

17:21.338 --> 17:22.403
most feared,

17:22.405 --> 17:23.869
most nefarious,

17:23.872 --> 17:27.675
most ultimate supervillain
the world has ever seen!

17:27.678 --> 17:31.849
I am Slade!

17:33.316 --> 17:35.082
Slade.

17:35.084 --> 17:38.219
Wow. His name is really fun
to say dramatically.

17:38.221 --> 17:40.554
Slade.

17:40.556 --> 17:42.424
Slade!

17:42.426 --> 17:44.560
- Slade!
- Slade!

17:44.562 --> 17:46.561
Slade!

17:46.563 --> 17:47.628
Silence!

17:47.630 --> 17:49.563
What is the point of all this?

17:49.565 --> 17:52.934
We're in need of an archnemesis and
we think you'd be a great fit.

17:52.936 --> 17:55.302
You gotta be kidding me.

17:55.304 --> 17:57.237
You guys are a joke.

17:57.239 --> 17:59.040
Everyone knows that.

17:59.042 --> 18:03.344
Besides, how could you be my
archnemesis when you've already lost?

18:04.781 --> 18:08.215
Because no one can withstand
my powers of...

18:08.217 --> 18:11.552
Mind manipulation!

18:11.554 --> 18:13.421
Look at this.

18:13.423 --> 18:17.926
An ordinary pencil made of
rigid wood and graphite.

18:17.928 --> 18:20.028
Held together
by a polymer adhesive.

18:20.030 --> 18:22.362
Topped off with
a delightful eraser.

18:22.364 --> 18:23.665
And what's your point?

18:23.667 --> 18:27.668
Can a solid pencil do this?

18:27.670 --> 18:30.071
- What? It's so rubbery!
- Yo, that be witchcraft!

18:30.073 --> 18:31.773
That's just
the start of it.

18:31.775 --> 18:34.642
You may think you have a grasp
on reality,

18:34.644 --> 18:39.080
but how can you even begin
to explain this?

18:39.082 --> 18:40.247
His thumb?

18:40.249 --> 18:42.250
Yes.

18:42.252 --> 18:46.020
An ordinary, opposable thumb connected
by flesh, tendons, and muscles.

18:46.022 --> 18:47.955
But what you're
about to witness

18:47.957 --> 18:50.858
may very well pull the rug
of empirical science

18:50.860 --> 18:53.264
from underneath your feet!

19:09.713 --> 19:13.682
Wait. Just stop it. These are just
tricks and optical illusions.

19:13.684 --> 19:15.817
What's that over there?

19:15.819 --> 19:17.519
- Don't listen to him.
- What is that?

19:17.521 --> 19:18.887
He's just trying to trick you again.
It's absolutely nothing.

19:18.889 --> 19:19.987
Oh, my gosh.

19:19.989 --> 19:21.423
No, seriously. I've never...

19:21.425 --> 19:22.790
What is that?
Is that even a...

19:22.792 --> 19:24.693
Don't look!
There's nothing over there.

19:24.695 --> 19:26.426
Even if one of you looks, and the
other ones close your eyes...

19:26.428 --> 19:28.530
There's probably nothing over here.
He's lying!

19:28.532 --> 19:30.865
Look it, guys,
I'm serious. Look!

19:30.867 --> 19:32.501
Don't do it.

19:37.675 --> 19:40.911
I can't resist.
Must look behind me.

19:42.512 --> 19:44.111
There's nothing there.

19:44.113 --> 19:45.580
- Made you look.
- What?

19:45.582 --> 19:47.448
See you later, losers.

19:47.450 --> 19:51.087
Give me a call when you guys learn
how to be real superheroes.

20:00.563 --> 20:01.899

20:03.833 --> 20:06.202

This guy? Really?

26:14.403 --> 26:16.071
You don't remember us?

26:16.073 --> 26:17.839
Perhaps this will remind...

26:17.841 --> 26:20.308
Stop. You're not on the list.

26:20.310 --> 26:22.644
Great. Now how are we
supposed to get in?

26:22.646 --> 26:24.211
Uh, portal.

26:24.213 --> 26:26.216
- Right.
- Yeah, portal, of course.

26:27.984 --> 26:29.717
Wow! Look at this.

26:29.719 --> 26:34.056
Standing on the back lot. This
is where the magic happens.

26:35.425 --> 26:37.090
- Oh, man, I love this.
- Ooh!

26:37.092 --> 26:39.793
That is where
the Animaniacs live.

26:39.795 --> 26:42.664
Ooh! It's that
car from that car movie.

26:48.271 --> 26:50.404
This place is amazing, yo.

26:50.406 --> 26:53.541
They're really making movies
about every superhero.

26:53.543 --> 26:56.010
And it's time they
make one about me.

26:56.012 --> 26:59.347
Come on. Jade Wilson's soundstage
must be around here somewhere.

26:59.349 --> 27:01.148
Hey, everybody, look at me.

27:01.150 --> 27:04.688
I'm Stan Lee doing my subtle cameo.

27:07.223 --> 27:08.990
Excuse me, Mr. Stan.

27:08.992 --> 27:14.197
This is a DC movie? Oh, gee.
I gotta get outta here.

27:15.965 --> 27:18.502
Oh, rad! Check it out!

27:25.240 --> 27:27.542
All right. Quiet on the set.

27:27.544 --> 27:29.709
Lights! Cameras!

27:29.711 --> 27:32.413
No moving around.
Closed set, please.

27:32.415 --> 27:34.849
Take one,
<i>Batman v Superman Part Two.</i>

27:34.851 --> 27:37.886
And just have fun with it.
Follow your instincts.

27:37.888 --> 27:39.119
Magic.

27:42.758 --> 27:44.625
What's your mother's name?

27:44.627 --> 27:45.659
Martha.

27:45.661 --> 27:48.097
My mommy's name
is Martha, too.

27:52.401 --> 27:54.601
Wait. What's
your father's name?

27:54.603 --> 27:55.569
Jonathan?

27:55.571 --> 27:57.638
Mine's Thomas!

27:57.640 --> 28:01.942
Cut! Clark, Bruce,
that was amazing!

28:01.944 --> 28:04.911
Ooh, am I not supposed to use
your real names?

28:04.913 --> 28:07.915
Relax. It's not a big deal.
Everybody knows.

28:07.917 --> 28:11.084
Let's run it again in five.

28:11.086 --> 28:14.121
The performances
were the amazing!

28:14.123 --> 28:16.590
Well, what are you
waiting for, bro?

28:16.592 --> 28:17.792
Go, Robin.

28:17.794 --> 28:19.662
The destiny awaits.

28:25.001 --> 28:29.070
You... You really think she's
going to give me a movie?

28:29.072 --> 28:30.838
Give?

28:30.840 --> 28:33.940
When Batman wants vengeance, do
bad guys just give it to him?

28:33.942 --> 28:35.342
No.

28:35.344 --> 28:37.544
That's right.
Batman takes that vengeance.

28:37.546 --> 28:40.680
All cracking skulls and putting
fools up in the hospital.

28:40.682 --> 28:43.016
Leaving them
with the permanent injuries.

28:43.018 --> 28:44.651
It's the same with movies.

28:44.653 --> 28:47.454
She won't just give you a
movie, you have to take it.

28:47.456 --> 28:48.789
Now what do you want?

28:48.791 --> 28:49.724
A movie.

28:49.726 --> 28:51.959
- Say it loud.
- I want a movie!

28:51.961 --> 28:53.828
- Again!
- I want a movie!

28:53.830 --> 28:54.962
Then take it!

28:54.964 --> 28:57.298
I'm gonna take it!

28:57.300 --> 28:59.870
Hey! Jade Wilson.

29:02.072 --> 29:06.107
Would you
please make a movie about me?

29:06.109 --> 29:08.109
Was that too aggressive?

29:08.111 --> 29:10.176
No. It was good.

29:10.178 --> 29:12.480

Robin. Wow.

31:23.144 --> 31:25.446
Wow.

31:25.448 --> 31:27.215
You just reminded me

31:27.217 --> 31:31.084
why I decided not to make a
Robin movie in the first place.

31:31.086 --> 31:32.552
I'm afraid it's gonna be a no.

31:32.554 --> 31:35.222
I'm so sorry.

31:35.224 --> 31:36.423
Why can't I have a movie?

31:36.425 --> 31:38.126
Oh, it's not you.

31:38.128 --> 31:40.093
Well, it is you.

31:40.095 --> 31:43.630
No one wants to watch a movie about
a sidekick without an archenemy.

31:43.632 --> 31:49.136
I mean, the only way I'd even consider it
is if there were no other superheroes.

31:49.138 --> 31:50.771
At all.

31:50.773 --> 31:53.240
But thanks so much
for coming in.

31:53.242 --> 31:56.646
And I promise not to keep you
in mind for future projects.

32:00.015 --> 32:02.382
Oh, I am the sorry,
friend Robin.

32:02.384 --> 32:03.717
Don't be.

32:03.719 --> 32:05.752
Wow, you're taking this
surprisingly well.

32:05.754 --> 32:08.288
Of course I am.
Didn't you hear what she said?

32:08.290 --> 32:12.592
That she would make a movie about us if
we were the only superheroes around.

32:12.594 --> 32:14.594
So, all we have to do is...

32:14.596 --> 32:16.230
Kill all the other
superheroes!

32:16.232 --> 32:17.363
Close, but no.

32:17.365 --> 32:18.800
I want us to save them

32:18.802 --> 32:21.334
from becoming superheroes
in the first place.

32:21.336 --> 32:25.339
Every superhero is born from a
tragic life-changing event.

32:25.341 --> 32:27.541
I propose
we travel through time

32:27.543 --> 32:30.244
and stop those tragic events
from taking place.

32:30.246 --> 32:31.344
Robin,

32:31.346 --> 32:34.948
this is the excellent plan!

32:34.950 --> 32:38.151
Ha-ha! Let's do
some time-traveling, yo!

32:38.153 --> 32:39.853
To the Time Cycles!

32:39.855 --> 32:40.987
Time Cycles?

32:40.989 --> 32:43.023
What's wrong with
our usual time machine?

32:45.428 --> 32:46.627
It's boring.

32:46.629 --> 32:49.263
We need something
more cinematic!

32:49.265 --> 32:51.565
Raven, summon the Time Cycles.

32:51.567 --> 32:53.902
<i>Azarath Metrion Zinthos!</i>

33:04.213 --> 33:05.849

- All right!

33:12.354 --> 33:14.454
Man, these bikes
ain't gots no power.

33:14.456 --> 33:18.359
Where are we gonna find Libyan terrorists
to sell us plutonium at this hour?

33:18.361 --> 33:19.760
We don't need plutonium.

33:19.762 --> 33:23.030
These Time Cycles
are powered by radness.

33:23.032 --> 33:24.534
Are you ready?

33:26.002 --> 33:28.468
Then let's go back
to the future!

33:28.470 --> 33:30.038
I mean, the past!

33:40.482 --> 33:41.881
This isn't rad enough.

Honey, I'm sorry.
We're pretty much all dead.

34:50.753 --> 34:52.217
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

34:52.219 --> 34:53.485

34:57.025 --> 35:00.394
You are the horrible parents!

35:00.396 --> 35:03.196
But we have no choice. The
crystals are not harmonized.

35:03.198 --> 35:06.936
The planet is collapsing. I've
tried all tonal combinations.

35:13.910 --> 35:16.012

36:22.477 --> 36:24.244
Yes! That's how we do it.

36:24.246 --> 36:25.845
Yeah!

37:35.851 --> 37:39.218

38:28.903 --> 38:30.503
Then we have
no choice, Titans.

38:30.505 --> 38:33.374
We have to prove to Jade
Wilson we aren't a joke.

38:33.376 --> 38:34.774
How's we gonna do that?

38:38.780 --> 38:41.548
This is how! It's Slade.

If we can make him
our archnemesis,

then Jade Wilson will see
that we're worthy of a movie.

38:50.392 --> 38:53.359

40:01.296 --> 40:03.432
Oh, my gosh!
What's that over there?

40:06.735 --> 40:08.068
It's a wall.

40:08.070 --> 40:10.736
Whoa! Whoa!
Impressive. Good for you.

40:10.738 --> 40:12.972
I knew it, too, obviously,
'cause I showed you.

40:12.974 --> 40:14.408
Put it to rest, Slade.

40:14.410 --> 40:16.542
We're not falling
for your mind tricks anymore.

40:16.544 --> 40:20.013
Okay, I am noble enough
to admit when I'm wrong.

40:20.015 --> 40:23.783
And oh, man, what is that
on your shirt right there?

40:23.785 --> 40:25.184
Anyway, what
I was saying was...

40:25.186 --> 40:26.854
And I'm serious,
because it doesn't look great.

40:26.856 --> 40:29.689
It's, like, eye-grabbing. It's
like your eye goes right to it.

40:29.691 --> 40:32.024
So, if I were you, I wouldn't
go in public like that.

40:32.026 --> 40:35.595
Even, like, a lick-and-rub would work.
If you just wanna, you know...

40:35.597 --> 40:37.830
On your finger, just
kinda moisten it a little.

40:37.832 --> 40:39.332
I don't know
how that's possible.

40:39.334 --> 40:42.104
I'm not even
wearing a shirt!

40:43.805 --> 40:47.975
Give it up, Slade. It's game over.

40:47.977 --> 40:49.642
Titans, go!

41:08.497 --> 41:10.062
Impressive.

41:28.883 --> 41:30.086
Booyah!

41:39.561 --> 41:40.928
Ca-caw!

41:54.309 --> 41:56.577
- Hello.
- How's it goin'?

41:56.579 --> 41:57.778
What up, Deadpool?

41:57.780 --> 41:59.548
I'm not Deadpool!

42:03.084 --> 42:04.316
Steady.

42:04.318 --> 42:06.688
We got him boxed in. Fire!

42:12.193 --> 42:13.894
Can't get a clean shot!

42:13.896 --> 42:14.961
We got this!

42:14.963 --> 42:16.028
Yeah, we do!

42:16.030 --> 42:17.699
Booyah!

42:21.269 --> 42:23.001
Ha!

42:27.977 --> 42:31.678
- Get off me! Get off me!
- I'm over here. Here I am.

42:31.680 --> 42:33.249
- Too slow, fool!
- Got him!

42:42.758 --> 42:44.390
<i>Facial scan accepted.</i>

42:46.861 --> 42:49.162
<i>Vault access granted.</i>

42:49.164 --> 42:51.100
<i>Item secured.</i>

42:51.700 --> 42:53.033
Crystal secure.

42:53.035 --> 42:55.635
Ha-ha! You'll never get it
now, Slade.

42:55.637 --> 42:58.004
No one can
penetrate our vault!

42:58.006 --> 42:59.342
Nice job, Titans.

43:13.055 --> 43:14.921
Raven, Starfire, save them!

43:14.923 --> 43:16.823
I'll take care of Slade!

43:26.501 --> 43:27.503
Gotcha.

43:29.403 --> 43:31.104
Get up.

43:31.106 --> 43:32.238
Stop milkin' it.

43:32.240 --> 43:34.274
- Rae-Rae?
- Don't call me that.

43:34.276 --> 43:35.876
You saved me.

43:35.878 --> 43:38.481
Let's not make it a big deal.

44:00.135 --> 44:02.535
Crack an egg on it.

44:02.537 --> 44:03.637
Ca-caw!

44:03.639 --> 44:07.173
Oh. What a cool
and ominous catchphrase.

44:07.175 --> 44:10.042
You truly are
a worthy archnemesis.

44:10.044 --> 44:12.479
Archnemesis? Really?
You mean it?

44:12.481 --> 44:15.849
I think you and I are destined
to do this forever.

44:15.851 --> 44:17.684
Until next time, Robin.

44:17.686 --> 44:20.053
There's not going
to be a next time.

44:20.055 --> 44:21.820
You're going to prison.

44:23.258 --> 44:25.225
That's not how having
an archnemesis works.

44:25.227 --> 44:29.829
I get away and you foil my next
plan in an even more heroic way.

44:29.831 --> 44:35.470
That's what happens in a great
superhero movie.

44:36.438 --> 44:38.204
A movie?

44:38.206 --> 44:40.442
Nice try, Slade.

44:41.276 --> 44:43.079
Where'd he go?

44:45.613 --> 44:49.115
Curse those Teen Titans
to the power of a million.

44:49.117 --> 44:52.484
They've stolen my device
and locked it in their vault.

44:52.486 --> 44:55.021
They're stronger
than I thought.

44:55.023 --> 44:58.191
Not too strong. Actually,
fairly weak compared to me.

44:58.193 --> 45:00.359
Definitely my cardio
is superior.

45:00.361 --> 45:02.562
Knees up,
knees up, knees up.

45:02.564 --> 45:05.465
No matter!
All I need to do

45:05.467 --> 45:09.537
is divide and conquer!

45:22.784 --> 45:23.883
Oh, man!

45:23.885 --> 45:26.521
I'm never letting you
fly my body again.

45:27.722 --> 45:29.321
Where is the Slade?

45:29.323 --> 45:33.162
He, uh, got away.
But we'll get him next time.

45:34.695 --> 45:36.028
It's Jade.

45:36.030 --> 45:38.500
She wants to see us tomorrow
morning at the studio.

45:47.642 --> 45:49.443
- Come on!
- It's the outrage!

45:49.445 --> 45:51.311
- We should be on the list!
- This guy!

45:51.313 --> 45:52.646
Whoa! It's the Teen Titans!

45:52.648 --> 45:55.148
Oh, wow! Wow, wow, wow,
this is an honor.

45:55.150 --> 45:56.850
You guys are the best.

45:56.852 --> 45:57.983
I, uh... I can't. Whoa.

45:57.985 --> 45:59.753
You know who we are?

45:59.755 --> 46:02.388
Yes, sir. Everyone is talking about you.
You're on the list.

46:02.390 --> 46:04.323
We are on the list!

46:04.325 --> 46:05.858
It's about time.

46:05.860 --> 46:07.861
Right this way.

46:07.863 --> 46:11.634
That is the more like the it.

46:13.501 --> 46:16.669
Welcome to the studio,
my stars.

46:16.671 --> 46:20.872
Now, that battle with Slade,
I mean, it was electric.

46:20.874 --> 46:23.675
Thanks, Miss Wilson.
Just doing our jobs.

46:23.677 --> 46:27.446
Robin, you have proven to me that
you are more than a sidekick.

46:27.448 --> 46:30.082
Now, let me show you
something marvelous.

46:30.084 --> 46:34.019
The <i>Teen Titans</i> movie set!

46:34.021 --> 46:35.323
Whoa!

46:36.724 --> 46:40.361
Robin, your dream
is coming the true.

46:41.363 --> 46:42.796
Wow.

46:42.798 --> 46:44.300
Incredible.

46:50.472 --> 46:53.372
It's really happening!

46:53.374 --> 46:54.474
Dope, right?

46:54.476 --> 46:56.943
This set seems so real.

46:56.945 --> 46:58.278
Even the toilet, yo.

46:58.280 --> 46:59.445
Well, the toilet isn't real.

46:59.447 --> 47:01.482
Uh, yeah, it is.
I pooped in it.

47:02.584 --> 47:05.218
- You what?
- I pooped in it.

47:05.220 --> 47:08.988
Hoo doggie, do not go in that bathroom,
'cause I just wrecked it, baby.

47:08.990 --> 47:10.524
That's what's up.

47:11.793 --> 47:14.059
We pooped in the toilet!

47:14.061 --> 47:15.260
Stop that!

47:15.262 --> 47:16.896
You are pooping
in a prop toilet!

47:16.898 --> 47:19.030
I don't know, bro.
Looked real to me.

47:19.032 --> 47:23.336
Ah, there is nothing quite like doing
the poops in the new bathroom.

47:24.673 --> 47:26.773
She pooped in the toilet!

47:26.775 --> 47:28.908
No one should
be using that bathroom!

47:28.910 --> 47:32.111
There is no plumbing. There is
nowhere for the poops to go.

47:32.113 --> 47:35.314
Hey, keep it down.
I'm trying to poop in here.

47:36.852 --> 47:39.318
Robin, do your friends know
that's a fake toilet?

47:39.320 --> 47:42.823
- Wow. Do not go in there.
- Oh, wow.

47:42.825 --> 47:45.591
You really did. You pooped in
the fake toilet.

47:45.593 --> 47:46.994
You pooped on my set.

47:46.996 --> 47:49.062
Miss Wilson, I am so sorry.

47:49.064 --> 47:51.700
It's cool. I deal with people
like this all day.

47:52.901 --> 47:55.501
Now, let me introduce
you to your co-star.

47:55.503 --> 47:57.035
- Slade?
- Get him!

47:59.941 --> 48:02.975
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Guys! I'm just
playing Slade in the movie.

48:02.977 --> 48:04.544
It's me, Shia LaBeouf.

48:04.546 --> 48:07.381
Oh, it's Shia LaBeoufs.

48:07.383 --> 48:09.414
That's even worse
than being a villain.

48:15.222 --> 48:17.323
Titans! Stop!

48:18.892 --> 48:21.128
Argh! Didn't you hear Jade?
Everything here is fake.

48:21.130 --> 48:24.930
Robin, if your team is going to poop
on the props and beat up the actors,

48:24.932 --> 48:26.432
this isn't going to work.

48:26.434 --> 48:27.999
Ugh. Maybe this
was a mistake.

48:28.001 --> 48:32.204
No, no, no! It's not.
Please. Just give me a second.

48:32.206 --> 48:33.872
Guys, this is my dream.

48:33.874 --> 48:37.609
We finally have a chance
to prove we're real heroes.

48:37.611 --> 48:40.613
That I'm a real hero.

48:40.615 --> 48:44.584
Please promise me
you'll take this seriously.

48:44.586 --> 48:48.620
We will do it, Robin.
Because it is your dream.

48:48.622 --> 48:50.756
Yeah, bro.
We'll do it for you.

48:50.758 --> 48:52.358
Yeah, man. We got this.

48:52.360 --> 48:54.794
Whatever.

48:54.796 --> 48:57.262
Miss Wilson,
the team and I discussed it

48:57.264 --> 49:00.099
and we promise from now on,
we'll behave ourselves.

49:00.101 --> 49:04.003
That's what I like to hear. You're
gonna be a big star, Robin.

49:04.005 --> 49:08.707
As long as your team doesn't
get into any more shenanigans.

49:08.709 --> 49:11.776
Anybody up
for some shenanigans?

49:11.778 --> 49:13.646
Shenanigans!

49:13.648 --> 49:15.148
- All right!
- This is gonna be fun!

49:15.150 --> 49:16.749
<i>♪ We're all gettin'
into shenanigans</i>

49:39.374 --> 49:42.675
Whoa, they gots
that good food in there, yo.

49:42.677 --> 49:45.611
But how can we
get past the Superman?

49:45.613 --> 49:48.851
We can exploit
his number one weakness.

49:55.289 --> 49:56.689
Hello?

49:56.691 --> 49:58.191
<i>Superman, it's me.</i>

49:58.193 --> 50:00.693
Your girlfriend, Lois Lane.

50:00.695 --> 50:02.595
Well, hello, Lois.

50:02.597 --> 50:04.231
<i>How are you, my sweet little dewdrop?</i>

50:04.233 --> 50:06.131
How am I?
I'm terrible.

50:06.133 --> 50:10.836
You gotta save me from Gene
Hackman's real estate scheme. Ahhh!

50:10.838 --> 50:12.872
Oh, my goodness.
No, that sounds terrible.

50:12.874 --> 50:15.841
Oh! You's better hurry, fool.

50:15.843 --> 50:20.048
Or no more smoochie smoochies.
Mwah! Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.

50:22.316 --> 50:24.082
I'm coming, Lois.

50:24.084 --> 50:25.753
I'm coming, Lois!

50:30.090 --> 50:31.524
Whoa!

50:31.526 --> 50:34.227
Looks at all
that opulence, yo.

50:34.229 --> 50:36.062
It is so the fancy.

50:36.064 --> 50:38.899
The table
is wearing the dress.

50:38.901 --> 50:40.265
Whoa!

50:40.267 --> 50:42.167
Let's dig in!

50:42.169 --> 50:45.072
- <i>♪ Shenanigans</i>
- <i>♪ Shena-na-na-na-na-nenigans ♪</i>

50:58.086 --> 51:01.454
Jade says we need to
finish construction by tonight.

51:01.456 --> 51:03.592
This smells of the fish.

51:21.809 --> 51:23.776
What happened to all the food?

51:23.778 --> 51:26.548
Let's steal some
from the <i>Spider-Man</i> set.

51:35.490 --> 51:38.457
Doomsday device?
Let's destroy it.

51:38.459 --> 51:40.662
With pleasure. Booyah!

51:46.101 --> 51:49.369
I knew you were goofsters.
But using Lois and now this?

51:49.371 --> 51:51.236
It's too much!

51:51.238 --> 51:53.039
I don't know why
you're working with Jade.

51:53.041 --> 51:56.376
But one way or another,
we're destroying that device.

51:56.378 --> 52:01.046
Stop it. How are you
going to get past me? I mean...

52:01.048 --> 52:04.883
By exploiting
your other weakness.

52:04.885 --> 52:06.553
Kryptonite party!

52:15.764 --> 52:17.396
- Yeah, boy!
- Yeah, baby!

52:18.532 --> 52:19.735
So...

52:20.934 --> 52:24.035
I see you've discovered
my secret plan.

52:24.037 --> 52:26.805
Titans! Why did you
do that to Superman?

52:26.807 --> 52:28.506
He's a national treasure.

52:28.508 --> 52:30.242
We're on to you, Jade.

52:30.244 --> 52:33.211
Yeah. You've done some kind of
mind tricks on them superheroes.

52:33.213 --> 52:35.347
So they'd help you build
a doomsday device.

52:35.349 --> 52:37.883
The shame upon you, Jade.

52:37.885 --> 52:41.887
The shame, the shame,
the shame!

52:41.889 --> 52:45.825
Is it true? Are you building
a doomsday device?

52:45.827 --> 52:49.662
It's not a "doomsday device."
It's my DOOMSDAY...

52:49.664 --> 52:52.564
Oh, oh, oh...
Oh, I see the confusion.

52:52.566 --> 52:54.501
DOOMSDAY stands for

52:54.503 --> 52:56.436
"Digitally Ordering
Online Movie

52:56.438 --> 52:58.204
"Streaming Directly At You."

52:58.206 --> 53:01.006
In retrospect, we should have
gone with a different acronym.

53:01.008 --> 53:05.343
But trust me, it's going to
revolutionize the movie industry.

53:05.345 --> 53:08.180
<i>Once finished, it will
broadcast my superhero movies</i>

53:08.182 --> 53:10.916
<i>onto all screens
everywhere in the world.</i>

53:10.918 --> 53:12.952
<i>Movie theaters,
televisions, phones,</i>

53:12.954 --> 53:15.954
<i>tablets, smartwatches,
microwaves, you name it.</i>

53:15.956 --> 53:18.758
<i>The population of Earth will be
able to watch superhero movies</i>

53:18.760 --> 53:22.160
anywhere, anytime,
all the time.

53:22.162 --> 53:25.196
Wait, that thing's just
a big movie projector?

53:25.198 --> 53:27.265
The <i>Teen Titans</i> movie
was going to be

53:27.267 --> 53:30.003
the first movie delivered
by the DOOMSDAY Device.

53:30.005 --> 53:32.004
What do you mean "was"?

53:32.006 --> 53:34.740
I'm killing
the Teen Titans movie!

53:43.785 --> 53:47.120
Miss the Wilson, please
do not murder the film.

53:47.122 --> 53:49.588
It is friend Robin's dream.

53:49.590 --> 53:51.691
Believe me, I did
not want to do this.

53:51.693 --> 53:55.827
But you guys are jokes. You
can't take anything seriously!

53:55.829 --> 53:58.765
That's why I won't make
a Teen Titans movie.

53:58.767 --> 54:02.200
But I would make a...
A Robin movie.

54:02.202 --> 54:05.403
A Robin movie?
All about me?

54:05.405 --> 54:07.606
All about you.

54:07.608 --> 54:10.109
But I know
you would never do it

54:10.111 --> 54:12.678
because your friends
are too important to you.

54:12.680 --> 54:14.046
You are correct.

54:14.048 --> 54:17.082
The friend Robin
would never leave us.

54:17.084 --> 54:18.550
- He would...
- I'll do it!

54:19.820 --> 54:22.787
Bro, is you
for reals gonna ditch us?

54:22.789 --> 54:26.191
But, Robin, we have done
all of this for you.

54:26.193 --> 54:28.928
Done all of what?
Make me look like a joke?

54:28.930 --> 54:33.131
We have to face it. No one takes
us seriously when we're together.

54:33.133 --> 54:36.102
Maybe we should just go
our separate ways.

54:36.104 --> 54:38.236
It's never easy
to tell the truth, Robin.

54:38.238 --> 54:41.673
But I am deeply touched
by what you've just done here.

54:41.675 --> 54:44.709
And you four, it was so nice
to meet you, but not really.

54:44.711 --> 54:48.180
And I'm sure we'll work together
again in the future, definitely not.

54:48.182 --> 54:51.082
I'm sorry, guys.
But it's what we need to do.

54:51.084 --> 54:54.854
Fine. Go make your own movie.
I'm going home to Dad.

54:54.856 --> 54:57.155
Well, the dumpster it is.

54:57.157 --> 54:59.992
I guess I'll have to be
a pro football star after all.

54:59.994 --> 55:02.463
That really
doesn't sound that bad.

55:08.769 --> 55:10.602
Good luck to you, Robin.

55:10.604 --> 55:12.972
I hope to one day
see your movie.

55:12.974 --> 55:15.975
I think it will be very good.

55:15.977 --> 55:17.711
- Star...
- Don't be sad, Robin.

55:17.713 --> 55:19.845
You don't need
your old friends anymore.

55:19.847 --> 55:23.582
You'll find that fame is worth
so much more than friendship

55:23.584 --> 55:28.986
because you are going to be
a big Hollywood star.

55:49.809 --> 55:51.746
Wow.

56:00.956 --> 56:02.423
And action!

56:04.557 --> 56:06.358
No longer a sidekick.

56:06.360 --> 56:08.660
That's not me!

56:08.662 --> 56:10.432
Oh, that was electric!

56:55.843 --> 56:57.876
I wonder
how they're doing now.

56:57.878 --> 56:59.077
They're doing great.

56:59.079 --> 57:00.613
- Really?
- I called them

57:00.615 --> 57:03.115
to see if they wanted
to make cameos in the film,

57:03.117 --> 57:05.383
but they're all too busy
with their fabulous lives.

57:05.385 --> 57:07.586
Maybe splitting up
was for the best.

57:07.588 --> 57:08.988
I couldn't agree more.

57:08.990 --> 57:11.724
Now focus, because we are
about to film

57:11.726 --> 57:15.093
the final scene
of your movie.

57:17.097 --> 57:19.798
Picture this.
You just defeated Slade.

57:19.800 --> 57:23.736
So in this scene, whoo,
you're gonna love this,

57:23.738 --> 57:25.738
you return
to the tower vault

57:25.740 --> 57:29.341
so you can lock away his evil device
along with the pain of your past.

57:29.343 --> 57:31.676
And then,

57:31.678 --> 57:33.711
you emerge as a new man!

57:33.713 --> 57:36.782
Robin, the superhero!

57:36.784 --> 57:38.283
Think you can act that?

57:38.285 --> 57:41.222
Act it?
I've lived it.

57:42.322 --> 57:44.525
And magic!

57:55.936 --> 57:57.937
Robin? Robin?

57:57.939 --> 58:00.705
Robin, can you hear me? Robin.

58:00.707 --> 58:03.376
What? What... What happened?

58:03.378 --> 58:06.778
Oh, thank goodness. A light
fell and knocked you out.

58:06.780 --> 58:08.414
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

58:08.416 --> 58:11.117
Let's just wrap for the day
so you can recover.

58:11.119 --> 58:12.550
And we'll start
fresh tomorrow.

58:12.552 --> 58:16.222
No, no, I'm fine.
Let's finish this movie.

58:16.224 --> 58:18.791
And that's what makes you
a real hero.

58:18.793 --> 58:20.595
Okay, let's do this!

58:24.198 --> 58:26.164
<i>Facial scan accepted.</i>

58:26.166 --> 58:28.401
Whoa. These effects
are pretty impressive.

58:28.403 --> 58:30.501
This is just like our vault.

58:30.503 --> 58:31.937
Why, thank you.

58:31.939 --> 58:33.840
I've designed it with
meticulous attention to detail.

58:33.842 --> 58:37.575
Now please type in the code.

58:37.577 --> 58:39.577
- <i>Invalid code.</i>
- No, no.

58:39.579 --> 58:43.481
It has to feel authentic,
so go again.

58:43.483 --> 58:46.218
- <i>Invalid code.</i>
- Focus. Again.

58:46.220 --> 58:47.519
<i>Invalid code.</i>

58:47.521 --> 58:49.655
No. Be in the moment!
Make it look real!

58:49.657 --> 58:51.090
All right.

58:53.762 --> 58:55.061
<i>Code accepted.</i>

58:55.063 --> 58:57.032
- <i>Vault access granted.</i>
- Yes!

59:00.300 --> 59:02.100
And cut! That was perfect.

59:02.102 --> 59:05.204
Robin, thank you.
You're a genius.

59:05.206 --> 59:07.773
Wow, these sets are amazing.

59:07.775 --> 59:09.341
They look so real.

59:09.343 --> 59:11.742
Well, because it is real.

59:11.744 --> 59:14.180
No, really. While you were knocked
out by our lighting accident,

59:14.182 --> 59:18.651
I moved you to the actual Titans Tower
so you could open the real vault for me.

59:18.653 --> 59:21.919
Good one. That would
make a great villain plot.

59:21.921 --> 59:23.287
We'll do it in the sequel.

59:23.289 --> 59:25.624
Whoa! Robin, what is that?

59:25.626 --> 59:28.193
Huh? I don't see anything.
There's nothing there.

59:28.195 --> 59:29.762
Made you look.

59:29.764 --> 59:30.966
No!

59:35.068 --> 59:37.602
So, everything, the movie,

59:37.604 --> 59:41.173
turning me against my friends,
it was all just...

59:41.175 --> 59:44.644
Mind manipulation.

59:44.646 --> 59:46.412
Slade.

59:46.414 --> 59:50.582
You were wearing a lady-director mask
over your Slade mask the whole time!

59:50.584 --> 59:53.619
Didn't you get
really sweaty under there?

59:53.621 --> 59:54.653
It gets stupid sweaty.

59:54.655 --> 59:55.854
And I've had
a bunch of rashes...

59:55.856 --> 59:57.321
Anyway, it doesn't matter!

59:57.323 --> 01:00:00.693
Now I can complete
my mind manipulation device.

01:00:00.695 --> 01:00:03.129
- The other superheroes will...
- Will stop me?

01:00:03.131 --> 01:00:04.463
Is that what
you were gonna say?

01:00:04.465 --> 01:00:07.533
They're too busy
making movies to stop me.

01:00:07.535 --> 01:00:10.568
It was all part
of my master plan, Robin.

01:00:10.570 --> 01:00:13.671
<i>I gave all the superheroes
movie deals.</i>

01:00:13.673 --> 01:00:16.441
<i>And while those dum-dums
were distracted filming,</i>

01:00:16.443 --> 01:00:21.180
<i>I stole valuable pieces of tech from
the cities they once protected.</i>

01:00:21.182 --> 01:00:26.050
<i>Now, with my fully
energized Ditronium Crystal,</i>

01:00:26.052 --> 01:00:29.588
<i>I will have the power
to encrypt your movie</i>

01:00:29.590 --> 01:00:33.325
<i>with my patented
mind manipulation!</i>

01:00:33.327 --> 01:00:36.729
<i>It will stream to every screen
in the entire world!</i>

01:00:36.731 --> 01:00:40.365
<i>And everyone
will be mine to control.</i>

01:00:40.367 --> 01:00:42.767
<i>People will rob banks for me.</i>

01:00:42.769 --> 01:00:45.970
<i>People will build
monuments of me!</i>

01:00:45.972 --> 01:00:49.175
<i>And if I tell them to pick me up
from the airport on short notice,</i>

01:00:49.177 --> 01:00:52.577
<i>they will pick me up.</i>

01:00:52.579 --> 01:00:54.146
You know what
a hassle that is.

01:00:54.148 --> 01:00:56.548
And once they've watched
your entire movie,

01:00:56.550 --> 01:01:00.653
the effects of my mind control
will be permanent.

01:01:00.655 --> 01:01:01.754
Thank you, Robin.

01:01:01.756 --> 01:01:04.957
You were so desperate
to be in a movie,

01:01:04.959 --> 01:01:09.026
that you turned your back on
everything important to you.

01:01:09.028 --> 01:01:12.266
Even your own friends.

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:16.271
This shall be
your final scene.

01:01:18.907 --> 01:01:19.972
Magic.

01:01:40.961 --> 01:01:46.265
How could I have been so stupid?
I'm not a hero.

01:01:46.267 --> 01:01:49.167
I'm a failure with no friends.

01:01:49.169 --> 01:01:52.704
And tiny, little baby hands.

01:01:52.706 --> 01:01:53.872
Baby hands!

01:01:57.678 --> 01:01:59.211
Baby hands!

01:03:26.534 --> 01:03:28.600
Titans, it's Robin.

01:03:28.602 --> 01:03:32.838
I don't know if you'll get this
transmission, but I need your help.

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:35.707
I know you're all happier
in your new lives

01:03:35.709 --> 01:03:38.410
and I know I said we were
holding each other back,

01:03:38.412 --> 01:03:40.812
but I was wrong.

01:03:40.814 --> 01:03:44.582
I thought we needed a movie
to be real heroes,

01:03:44.584 --> 01:03:46.952
but we were
already real heroes.

01:03:46.954 --> 01:03:49.153
Because we were a team.

01:03:49.155 --> 01:03:51.390
And I threw that all away.

01:03:51.392 --> 01:03:54.758
I'm going to Hollywood
to set things right.

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:58.229
If I don't make it back,
I'm sorry.

01:03:58.231 --> 01:04:00.131
I never meant to let you down.

01:04:02.501 --> 01:04:04.537
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

01:04:04.539 --> 01:04:09.809
I just get so emotional when
it comes to these types of scenes.

01:04:09.811 --> 01:04:10.709
You're back!

01:04:10.711 --> 01:04:12.678
Of course we're back, fool.

01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:16.347
The friendship will always
bring us back together.

01:04:16.349 --> 01:04:17.682
I can't believe it!

01:04:17.684 --> 01:04:19.617
Listen, we need
to get back to Hollywood.

01:04:19.619 --> 01:04:21.854
This is going to sound crazy,
but Jade Wilson...

01:04:21.856 --> 01:04:23.555
Is actually Slade.

01:04:23.557 --> 01:04:25.457
And the superhero movies are part
of his plot to take over the world.

01:04:26.994 --> 01:04:28.660
Saw it coming a mile away.

01:04:28.662 --> 01:04:31.030
Let's go
save the world, yo!

01:04:31.032 --> 01:04:32.300
Titans, go!

01:04:34.202 --> 01:04:36.869
Super-ladies
and super-gentlemen,

01:04:36.871 --> 01:04:40.238
I am thrilled to present
my latest film,

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:42.874
<i>Robin The Movie!</i>

01:04:44.378 --> 01:04:47.613
And with the help of my fully
operational DOOMSDAY Device...

01:04:47.615 --> 01:04:48.812
It's a bad name,
I know.

01:04:48.814 --> 01:04:50.716
The entire population
of Earth

01:04:50.718 --> 01:04:54.919
will experience the mind-blowing
story at the same time!

01:04:56.189 --> 01:04:58.923
Unfortunately, our star
can't be here tonight

01:04:58.925 --> 01:05:02.760
because he has
explosive diarrhea.

01:05:02.762 --> 01:05:04.129
But he insisted

01:05:04.131 --> 01:05:06.064
that tonight
was too important

01:05:06.066 --> 01:05:08.767
and the show must go on!

01:05:08.769 --> 01:05:12.370
So without further ado,
sit back, relax and...

01:05:12.372 --> 01:05:14.673
Enjoy us ruining your plan!

01:05:14.675 --> 01:05:16.975
Oh! My man
finished yo sentence!

01:05:16.977 --> 01:05:20.146
Give it up, Wilson.
Your plan ends here.

01:05:20.148 --> 01:05:24.182
Wow. Fighting through explosive diarrhea.
What a champ.

01:05:24.184 --> 01:05:27.051
I do have
something explosive,

01:05:27.053 --> 01:05:29.287
but it's not diarrhea.

01:05:29.289 --> 01:05:30.821
It's the truth!

01:05:30.823 --> 01:05:34.292
Why don't you tell everyone
who you really are, Jade?

01:05:34.294 --> 01:05:35.796
Or should I say...

01:05:38.999 --> 01:05:40.999
Slade!

01:05:41.001 --> 01:05:44.102
Slade!

01:05:44.104 --> 01:05:45.970
Slade!

01:05:45.972 --> 01:05:47.539
Game over.

01:05:47.541 --> 01:05:51.376
You've gotta deal with us and
every superhero in the world.

01:05:51.378 --> 01:05:54.414
Sorry, Robin,
but you're too late.

01:06:19.307 --> 01:06:24.443
Now that they're under my full mind
control, they'll do anything I want.

01:06:24.445 --> 01:06:26.546
Destroy the Teen Titans.

01:06:48.836 --> 01:06:51.406
We have to destroy
that DOOMSDAY Device.

01:06:57.010 --> 01:06:59.514
I think we lost him.

01:07:32.146 --> 01:07:35.115
Ooh! There is no
stopping the Batman.

01:07:41.088 --> 01:07:42.689
Halt for the mighty...

01:07:48.861 --> 01:07:50.629
- Hey.
- Stan Lee?

01:07:50.631 --> 01:07:55.767
I'm back. I don't care if it's a DC movie.
I love cameos.

01:07:55.769 --> 01:07:57.602
Not now, Stan Lee!

01:07:57.604 --> 01:08:00.741
Excelsior!

01:08:03.242 --> 01:08:04.910
We can't shake them.

01:08:04.912 --> 01:08:06.945
You guys keep
the superheroes distracted.

01:08:06.947 --> 01:08:09.550
I'm going after
that DOOMSDAY Device!

01:08:27.166 --> 01:08:30.636
How are we supposed to defeat the
world's greatest superheroes?

01:08:30.638 --> 01:08:32.470
Portal.

01:08:32.471 --> 01:08:33.640
- Oh, yeah. Right, right, right.
- Oh, the yes!

01:08:36.643 --> 01:08:39.113
Challengers, we're saved!

01:09:34.835 --> 01:09:36.170
Look at it, Robin.

01:09:37.504 --> 01:09:38.569
No!

01:09:38.571 --> 01:09:40.305
Oh, it's so awesome.

01:09:40.307 --> 01:09:42.274
It's so cool.

01:09:42.276 --> 01:09:46.243
It's the most incredible superhero
movie the world has ever seen.

01:09:46.245 --> 01:09:48.613
- No.
- It's got special effects.

01:09:48.615 --> 01:09:51.349
Like tons and tons
of special effects.

01:09:51.350 --> 01:09:54.485
Even your super sweet
cape is special effects.

01:09:54.487 --> 01:09:55.921
It'll blow your mind.

01:09:55.923 --> 01:09:57.454
Just take a quick peek.

01:09:57.456 --> 01:10:00.926
It's your movie, your movie,
your superhero movie.

01:10:00.928 --> 01:10:02.830
It's all about you.

01:10:12.939 --> 01:10:15.507
Come on, Robin,
let's take this fool out.

01:10:22.415 --> 01:10:24.983
It's time to eliminate them.

01:10:24.985 --> 01:10:27.785
Must eliminate.

01:10:27.787 --> 01:10:30.021
Robin, stop! Snap out of it!

01:10:30.023 --> 01:10:33.026
You've always held me back.

01:10:36.095 --> 01:10:37.962
What are you talking
about, bro?

01:10:39.232 --> 01:10:40.465
Beast Boy!

01:10:40.467 --> 01:10:41.599
Fight it, man!

01:10:41.601 --> 01:10:43.101
Come on!

01:10:43.103 --> 01:10:45.636
Robin, this is not the you.

01:10:50.344 --> 01:10:51.743
Finish them, Robin.

01:10:51.745 --> 01:10:53.145
Kill!

01:10:53.147 --> 01:10:55.047
Wait! The please!

01:10:55.049 --> 01:10:57.949
There's another
Robin movie you must see!

01:10:57.951 --> 01:10:59.987
Yeah. The real one.

01:11:01.554 --> 01:11:04.355
<i>Then he grew up and
he wasn't a baby no more.</i>

01:11:04.357 --> 01:11:05.958
<i>But he still had them
baby hands, yo.</i>

01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:08.193
You always thought
I was a joke.

01:11:08.195 --> 01:11:10.328
<i>But when there's
crime happening,</i>

01:11:10.330 --> 01:11:12.631
<i>Robin is the dude who keeps
fighting till he wins, yo.</i>

01:11:12.633 --> 01:11:14.465
<i>He's like a bulldog.</i>

01:11:14.467 --> 01:11:16.568
<i>Sinks his teeth into that crime
and won't nevers let go!</i>

01:11:16.570 --> 01:11:18.904
<i>Before the
Robin, we were all alone.</i>

01:11:20.607 --> 01:11:22.407
<i>But he brought us
together to be the team.</i>

01:11:22.409 --> 01:11:25.877
He may not have superpowers,
but he is a superhero.

01:11:25.879 --> 01:11:27.213
Our hero.

01:11:37.090 --> 01:11:38.289
Titans?

01:11:38.291 --> 01:11:40.458
Oh! He is the back!

01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:42.560
You were never a joke to us.

01:11:42.562 --> 01:11:44.430
You are our leader.

01:11:44.432 --> 01:11:45.663
Our hero.

01:11:45.665 --> 01:11:46.765
Our friend.

01:11:48.768 --> 01:11:51.136
Under the mask,
my other eye is crying.

01:11:51.138 --> 01:11:54.372
We're taking you down.
Together.

01:11:54.374 --> 01:11:58.142
Robin. Don't you know
anything about archvillains?

01:11:58.144 --> 01:12:00.981
We always have
a backup plan, girlfriend.

01:12:46.058 --> 01:12:47.527
- Portal?
- Portal!

01:12:51.165 --> 01:12:52.696
What?

01:12:52.698 --> 01:12:53.864
<i>That was weird.</i>

01:12:58.205 --> 01:13:00.738
<i>You're never gonna beat me
now that I'm a giant robot.</i>

01:13:00.740 --> 01:13:03.474
<i>Give up. This is dumb. Now
you're wasting everybody's time.</i>

01:13:03.476 --> 01:13:05.144
We'll stop you, Slade.

01:13:05.146 --> 01:13:07.212
<i>How are you gonna do it?
How are you gonna beat me?</i>

01:13:07.214 --> 01:13:09.379
<i>You haven't done it yet. You keep
talking about how you're gonna do it.</i>

01:13:09.381 --> 01:13:11.015
<i>What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna fart on me?</i>

01:13:11.017 --> 01:13:12.417
<i>You wanna have a dance-off?</i>

01:13:12.419 --> 01:13:14.988
You gonna annoy me to death
with your waffles?

01:13:17.089 --> 01:13:19.423
You guys are jokes.

01:13:19.425 --> 01:13:21.262
<i>Total jokes!</i>

01:13:22.729 --> 01:13:24.828
You're right.

01:13:24.830 --> 01:13:26.564
We are jokes.

01:13:26.566 --> 01:13:29.534
We're not like the other
superheroes, and never will be.

01:13:31.103 --> 01:13:33.770

Hey, I guess you aren't
such goofsters after all.

01:16:28.615 --> 01:16:32.182
Fellow heroes, I've learned
something important today.

01:16:32.184 --> 01:16:35.321
You don't need to be super
to be a superhero.

01:16:37.022 --> 01:16:40.057
You just need to be yourself.

01:16:52.438 --> 01:16:53.773
And expanding on that thought.

01:16:55.075 --> 01:16:56.608
We should never forget that...

01:16:56.610 --> 01:16:58.976
Uh, dude? Why are you
still talkin'?

01:16:58.978 --> 01:17:01.979
I'm simply trying to highlight
the lesson we all learned.

01:17:01.981 --> 01:17:03.881
No one wants
to hear that, man.

01:17:03.883 --> 01:17:06.016
Dude, the movie's wrapping up. People
are trying to get out of here.

important takeaway message

01:17:08.153 --> 01:17:10.354
