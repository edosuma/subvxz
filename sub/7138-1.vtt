WEBVTT

01:46.133 --> 01:48.400
- Oz, the name on the street

01:48.467 --> 01:51.200
for the Oswald State
Correctional Facility,

01:51.266 --> 01:53.033
level four.

01:53.100 --> 01:54.767
Yeah, it's me.

01:54.834 --> 01:56.367
You thought I was dead,
didn't you?

01:56.433 --> 01:58.600
Well, I am.

01:58.667 --> 02:00.633
But that don't mean
I can't keep jawing,

02:00.700 --> 02:02.166
and now that
I crossed over,

02:02.233 --> 02:04.400
I got a whole new perspective
on things,

02:04.467 --> 02:08.233
and I'm seeing a lot
of familiar faces.

02:13.367 --> 02:14.433
- Fuck!

02:14.500 --> 02:17.000
- Chill the fuck out.

02:17.066 --> 02:19.600
- Yeah, this ain't so bad.
Let me tell you,

02:19.667 --> 02:21.233
dying's a lot harder
on the livin'

02:21.300 --> 02:23.100
than it is on the dead.

02:23.166 --> 02:27.533
Death really only hurts
those left behind.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
- Tim, what are you doing ?

02:45.066 --> 02:47.633
- Hey, come here.

02:50.033 --> 02:52.600
What do you think ?

02:52.667 --> 02:53.767
- What are you, Picasso ?

02:53.834 --> 02:55.133
- No, it's not art.

02:55.200 --> 02:57.500
It's a maze,
it's a meditative maze.

02:57.567 --> 03:00.233
- Oh, okay.

03:00.300 --> 03:01.867
What's a meditative maze ?

03:01.934 --> 03:04.934
- Well, if you got a problem

03:05.000 --> 03:07.600
that you're trying
to figure out,

03:07.667 --> 03:10.433
you enter the maze,

03:10.500 --> 03:12.600
and...

03:12.667 --> 03:16.033
as you make your way through,

03:16.100 --> 03:18.900
you concentrate
on finding the right path,

03:18.967 --> 03:21.500
which stimulates
your powers of reason,

03:21.567 --> 03:23.300
and by the time
you reach the end,

03:23.367 --> 03:25.667
hopefully you'll have
figured the problem out.

03:25.734 --> 03:27.266
- Oh, yeah, I forgot.

03:27.333 --> 03:30.100
You went to that
New Age seminar last weekend.

03:30.166 --> 03:34.467
- Yeah, so many people that died
since they set up Em City,

03:34.533 --> 03:38.000
I was beginning
to feel anesthetized, you know.

03:38.066 --> 03:40.633
But Augustus Hill.

03:40.700 --> 03:43.433
Boy, that rocked me.

03:43.500 --> 03:44.900
I don't know.

03:44.967 --> 03:48.667
A maze is kind of dumb,
but who's to say, right ?

03:48.734 --> 03:51.100
I mean, if it works...

03:51.166 --> 03:53.066
we gotta try it, right ?
- Sure, Tim.

03:53.133 --> 03:56.633
Only, you know,
without real walls,

03:56.700 --> 03:59.100
these dinks are just gonna

03:59.166 --> 04:01.233
step over the line.

04:01.300 --> 04:03.700
After Augustus died,

04:03.767 --> 04:07.033
and we cleaned out
his footlocker,

04:07.100 --> 04:09.533
I found this box.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.667
Now, written
on the lid is

04:11.734 --> 04:13.100
"Do not open

04:13.166 --> 04:16.233
until six months
after my death."

04:16.300 --> 04:20.000
So, I decided
to respect his wishes.

04:20.066 --> 04:22.934
This morning,
six months exactly,

04:23.000 --> 04:25.100
I looked inside.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.834
And?

04:30.033 --> 04:31.900
"I am having a premonition
that today is

04:31.967 --> 04:34.967
"the last day of my life.

04:35.033 --> 04:37.934
"Or maybe it is not
a premonition.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.867
"In Oz, every day is
potentially your last one.

04:41.934 --> 04:43.567
"Anyway,
I'm taking the precaution

04:43.633 --> 04:45.633
"of sealing up this box.

04:45.700 --> 04:49.500
Both: "Inside you,
and by that I mean McManus,

04:49.567 --> 04:51.133
"Burr and Said...

04:51.200 --> 04:52.800
- "Will find a manuscript
which I've been writing

04:52.867 --> 04:54.967
"over the past six years.

04:55.033 --> 04:56.400
"If you're perusing this letter,

04:56.467 --> 04:58.700
"then my premonition was right

04:58.767 --> 05:00.433
"and I am dead.

05:00.500 --> 05:04.800
"So consider these pages
my last will and testament.

05:04.867 --> 05:07.200
"My will to survive.

05:07.266 --> 05:11.400
"My testament to all
I've experienced in Oz.

05:11.467 --> 05:14.266
- "I ask you to read my memories

05:14.333 --> 05:17.600
and then do with them
whatever you think is right."

05:30.166 --> 05:31.400
Burr.

05:31.467 --> 05:34.400
- I don't want any
fucking part of this.

05:45.467 --> 05:48.266
- Hey, Baba.

05:48.333 --> 05:49.567
- Welcome back, Chucky.

05:49.633 --> 05:51.200
You look good,
all healthy and shit.

05:51.266 --> 05:52.967
- I guess I was
pretty close to death,

05:53.033 --> 05:55.800
but Dr. Nathan,
she pulled me through.

05:55.867 --> 05:56.900
What's the latest?

05:56.967 --> 05:58.834
- The tits are flowing
free and easy,

05:58.900 --> 06:01.266
especially now that
the niggers are out of the game.

06:01.333 --> 06:03.467
Augustus Hill's death
really shattered them.

06:03.533 --> 06:04.633
- Redding too?

06:04.700 --> 06:06.133
- I don't understand
the man.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.867
Franky Urbano goes
to stab Redding, kills Hill,

06:08.934 --> 06:10.600
but Redding hasn't even
tried to retaliate.

06:10.667 --> 06:12.967
- Redding's plotting something,
that's for sure.

06:13.033 --> 06:14.767
- Yeah, but what?

06:30.033 --> 06:32.066
- Kill Whitey!

06:39.266 --> 06:41.433
- Okay, let's break it up.

06:41.500 --> 06:42.767
There's nothing to see here.

06:42.834 --> 06:45.166
It's over, move on.

06:45.233 --> 06:48.066
- Redding,
are you watching this?

06:48.133 --> 06:50.433
Redding!

06:55.533 --> 06:59.266
While you weeping and a wailing,
your men are out of control.

06:59.333 --> 07:01.166
- They're upset
over losing Augustus.

07:01.233 --> 07:02.300
What do you
expect me to do?

07:02.367 --> 07:05.200
- I expect you
to take charge.

07:05.266 --> 07:06.867
- Oh, geez, Kareem,

07:06.934 --> 07:11.066
I'd have thought you'd be glad
to see me sit in the back seat.

07:11.133 --> 07:15.100
Give you an opportunity
to convert all my boys to Islam.

07:15.166 --> 07:18.500
- Yeah, well, there are some
who will never find God.

07:18.567 --> 07:21.967
Nonetheless,
they need a leader,

07:22.033 --> 07:24.266
and you are their leader.

07:24.333 --> 07:27.633
But right now
you do not truly lead.

07:27.700 --> 07:30.100
You sit in here
mourning Augustus.

07:30.166 --> 07:32.033
As well, you should.

07:32.100 --> 07:33.600
And you blame yourself.

07:33.667 --> 07:36.367
As well, you should.

07:36.433 --> 07:37.934
But what's the difference,

07:38.000 --> 07:41.033
unless your emotions
are backed by action.

07:41.100 --> 07:44.233
If Augustus's murder was truly
due to him slinging drugs

07:44.300 --> 07:48.166
and you say you do not want
to see anymore young men die,

07:48.233 --> 07:49.533
fine.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.166
Drag your men away
from the drugs.

07:51.233 --> 07:52.333
- How?

07:52.400 --> 07:55.300
- I don't know.

07:55.367 --> 07:56.867
The answer lies within you.

07:56.934 --> 07:58.567
When you find it,

07:58.633 --> 07:59.800
it is then that
you will finally,

07:59.867 --> 08:03.033
completely be a leader.

08:03.100 --> 08:06.000
'Til then,
you just a waste of space.

08:45.333 --> 08:48.400
- Aah!

08:52.266 --> 08:56.100
- Hey, I want to talk to you
about what happens after death.

08:56.166 --> 08:57.533
The afterlife.

08:57.600 --> 09:00.166
See, the ancient Greeks believed
when a brother died,

09:00.233 --> 09:01.967
he just got on a boat,

09:02.033 --> 09:03.166
crossed the River Styx

09:03.233 --> 09:04.667
and went to a place
called Hades.

09:04.734 --> 09:06.834
Now everybody went to Hades.

09:06.900 --> 09:09.734
It didn't matter how good
or how bad you were.

09:09.800 --> 09:12.133
It's the place we all just
got our groove on.

09:12.200 --> 09:14.367
But the Greeks,
they understood,

09:14.433 --> 09:16.133
just having lived,

09:16.200 --> 09:19.567
just having gone through
the sheer shit of getting up

09:19.633 --> 09:21.333
and going through a whole day,

09:21.400 --> 09:24.066
was enough
to earn eternal reward.

09:25.934 --> 09:28.367
- Good morning, boys.

09:28.433 --> 09:30.433
Today's the big day.

09:30.500 --> 09:33.834
All you yokels get
to whine and snivel

09:33.900 --> 09:35.800
in front of the review boards

09:35.867 --> 09:39.033
in hopes that we'll
let you out of solitary.

09:39.100 --> 09:44.900
Though God knows why you'd
wanna leave this paradise.

09:44.967 --> 09:46.734
- My man, McManus,
he gonna vouch for me.

09:46.800 --> 09:48.533
He gonna save me,
you know.

09:48.600 --> 09:50.800
- I'd say my chances are 50/50.

09:50.867 --> 09:52.700
- Glynn's a fuckhead.

09:52.767 --> 09:56.266
That motherfucker's
never gonna let me out.

09:56.333 --> 09:58.834
- You'll cast your vote for me,
won't you, Officer Howell?

09:58.900 --> 10:01.867
- Oh, suck your big fat hole!

10:01.934 --> 10:04.700
Where's breakfast?
Breakfast!

10:06.333 --> 10:08.333
- What the fuck you
looking at, Martinez?

10:08.400 --> 10:10.767
- You.
- Step back.

10:10.834 --> 10:13.100
- Make me.

10:16.367 --> 10:18.266
- How'd you know
I was in the mood

10:18.333 --> 10:20.100
for a little Mexican food?

10:20.166 --> 10:21.467
- I'm Puerto Rican.

10:21.533 --> 10:23.367
- Same difference.

10:23.433 --> 10:25.767
Strip.

10:37.500 --> 10:40.166
- Oh, Martinez
is fucking Howell.

10:40.233 --> 10:41.533
- He's fucking her again ?

10:41.600 --> 10:43.433
- He must need
to make a phone call.

10:43.500 --> 10:45.233
- Damn.

10:45.300 --> 10:48.166
- As you know, the time has come
for our biannual review

10:48.233 --> 10:50.033
of the prisoners in solitary,

10:50.100 --> 10:51.934
which I hate
to admit is SRO.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.066
So we either need to let some
of these dinks back into Gen Pop

10:55.133 --> 10:57.900
or ship their butts to another
correctional facility.

10:57.967 --> 10:59.800
Who's first?

10:59.867 --> 11:01.300
- Henry Stanton.

11:01.367 --> 11:04.767
He's in solitary for stabbing
Martin Montgomery in the neck.

11:04.834 --> 11:06.633
- Talkin' no more!
- Ah!

11:06.700 --> 11:09.266
- Montgomery didn't even die.

11:09.333 --> 11:12.000
He just can't sing anymore.

11:12.066 --> 11:13.400
Next?

11:13.467 --> 11:14.834
- Vern Schillinger,

11:14.900 --> 11:19.033
for raping Franklin Winthrop
and Adam Guenzel.

11:19.100 --> 11:20.967
- I'm telling you,
the sex was consensual.

11:21.033 --> 11:22.000
Ask Winthrop.

11:22.066 --> 11:24.033
- Miguel Alvarez.

11:24.100 --> 11:27.166
He smacked a member
of the parole board.

11:27.233 --> 11:30.200
- I guess I got my hopes
up too high.

11:30.266 --> 11:32.433
I'm not gonna do that again.

11:32.500 --> 11:34.400
- Omar White.
He, uh...

11:34.467 --> 11:37.233
- Omar strangled an Aryan.

11:37.300 --> 11:39.934
- And then he saved
a guy's life.

11:49.767 --> 11:52.633
- Next.

11:52.700 --> 11:54.200
- Greg Penders,

11:54.266 --> 11:58.333
trained his seeing-eye mutt
to attack Officer Lopresti.

11:58.400 --> 11:59.734
- Lopresti's fine.

11:59.800 --> 12:03.200
Not a scratch on him.

12:03.266 --> 12:07.000
- Carlos Martinez threw
a cocktail in Dave Brass' face.

12:07.066 --> 12:08.400
- Motherfucker!

12:08.467 --> 12:09.600
- Yeah, and as a result,

12:09.667 --> 12:12.066
the CO's beat the shit
out of Martinez.

12:15.967 --> 12:17.367
- Martinez is scum.

12:17.433 --> 12:19.900
We definitely should not
let him out of solitary.

12:19.967 --> 12:22.734
- He and Penders
both attacked CO's.

12:22.800 --> 12:24.900
I won't let either of them
back into Gen Pop.

12:24.967 --> 12:26.800
Any recommendations
regarding the others?

12:26.867 --> 12:28.467
- Stanton and Schillinger
could go.

12:28.533 --> 12:30.900
- Schillinger?
No way.

12:30.967 --> 12:32.867
If he's free,
he'll do something

12:32.934 --> 12:34.800
to screw up
Tobias Beecher's parole hearing.

12:34.867 --> 12:37.367
- Miguel Alvarez.
I want him in Em City.

12:37.433 --> 12:39.567
- Leo, he's trying to change.

12:39.633 --> 12:40.633
- So's Omar White.

12:40.700 --> 12:41.667
I don't hear you
begging for him.

12:41.734 --> 12:43.667
- I can help Alvarez.

12:43.734 --> 12:46.233
I can't do anymore for Omar
than I've already done.

12:46.300 --> 12:48.200
- Fuck.

12:50.266 --> 12:51.767
- Hey, Omar.

12:51.834 --> 12:54.100
You and me get to spend
a little quality time together.

12:54.166 --> 12:56.667
- What--what are you
squawking about ?

12:56.734 --> 12:59.934
- McManus has left you here
in my warm embrace.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.834
- No, no, wait,
let me talk to him.

13:01.900 --> 13:03.333
Please.
- If I help you,

13:03.400 --> 13:05.200
what'll you do for me
in return?

13:05.266 --> 13:06.233
- I don't know.

13:06.300 --> 13:09.233
- Shine my shoes?

13:09.300 --> 13:12.834
- No, I-I ain't
no Pullman porter.

13:13.633 --> 13:15.033
- Strip.

13:17.533 --> 13:20.834
Look, um...

13:20.900 --> 13:24.000
I-I, uh...

13:24.066 --> 13:25.867
I ain't been feeling
to good lately, you know.

13:25.934 --> 13:28.500
- Strip.

13:31.700 --> 13:33.834
Hurry.
I have lunch plans.

13:38.200 --> 13:39.900
- Ugh!

13:39.967 --> 13:41.433
- Told you I was sick.

13:41.500 --> 13:43.400
- You know what ?

13:43.467 --> 13:47.166
Today, you are
the shoe shine boy.

13:47.233 --> 13:50.567
Ugh, man!

13:52.433 --> 13:54.500
- Okay.

13:54.567 --> 13:57.233
- Just coughing up
all kinds of colors and shit.

13:59.066 --> 14:01.100
My--my piss
is like it's on fire.

14:01.166 --> 14:02.533
- Any night sweats?

14:02.600 --> 14:04.667
Trouble sleeping?
- Uh-uh.

14:04.734 --> 14:05.767
- Hmm.

14:05.834 --> 14:07.100
- I'd better admit him.

14:07.166 --> 14:08.700
- Why, what's wrong with him?

14:08.767 --> 14:11.967
- I'm not sure.
I'll do some tests.

14:13.367 --> 14:15.734
- If it turns out
you're faking, dickwad,

14:15.800 --> 14:19.133
I'm gonna eat your balls
for breakfast.

14:24.767 --> 14:26.367
- By a vote of four to three,

14:26.433 --> 14:29.533
we've decided
to release you from solitary.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.633
- You're shitting me.
- No, Miguel.

14:31.700 --> 14:33.400
You're coming back
to Emerald City.

14:33.467 --> 14:36.000
- McManus put himself
on the line for you, Alvarez.

14:36.066 --> 14:38.100
Don't fuck him over
with more of your nonsense.

14:38.166 --> 14:40.233
- My nonsense, no.

14:40.300 --> 14:42.867
I got enemies.
I can't control their nonsense.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.633
- Break it up!
Stop!

15:09.266 --> 15:12.600
- So, what was that little
scuffle with Torres about ?

15:12.667 --> 15:16.000
- I don't know.
He's crazy.

15:16.066 --> 15:18.467
- Okay, Chico.

15:18.533 --> 15:21.133
You know, I've been doing
some sniffing around,

15:21.200 --> 15:23.033
and I've been able to piece
together some information

15:23.100 --> 15:25.100
I thought you'd find
sort of interesting.

15:25.166 --> 15:27.033
It's about Miguel Alvarez.

15:27.100 --> 15:29.567
Every problem he's had
for the past five years or so

15:29.633 --> 15:30.734
is somehow tied to you.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.033
- Me?
No.

15:32.100 --> 15:33.533
- So I'm telling you this.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.400
If Miguel has
anymore difficulties,

15:35.467 --> 15:37.133
I'm gonna be looking
to blame you,

15:37.200 --> 15:39.834
and now that we got a lot
of free space in solitary,

15:39.900 --> 15:43.667
my first reaction to any trouble
will be to ship your ass there.

15:43.734 --> 15:44.967
- Wait a minute!

15:45.033 --> 15:47.400
- Unless you become Alvarez's
new best friend.

15:47.467 --> 15:49.600
Miguel.

15:49.667 --> 15:51.467
We were just talking about you.

15:51.533 --> 15:54.500
Guerra's got something
to say to you.

16:03.767 --> 16:06.867
- Yeah.

16:06.934 --> 16:08.400
You know...

16:09.500 --> 16:12.967
You and me,
we started out as friends,

16:13.033 --> 16:16.433
and even though a whole lot of
shit has come down since then...

16:18.300 --> 16:20.967
I'm thinking maybe we could

16:21.033 --> 16:23.900
be, uh, you know...

16:23.967 --> 16:27.000
- Yeah, Chico.

16:39.200 --> 16:40.767
- Yo tambien.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.700
- Shake hands.

17:08.500 --> 17:12.033
- Lights out.
Sweet dreams.

17:16.333 --> 17:18.900
- I saw you and Alvarez
making nice.

17:18.967 --> 17:20.300
Were you serious?

17:20.367 --> 17:21.767
- The truth?

17:21.834 --> 17:23.400
I don't know.

17:23.467 --> 17:25.266
I've hated his guts
for so many years,

17:25.333 --> 17:28.033
now I can't even
remember why.

17:28.100 --> 17:31.433
And today I almost
got my throat cut.

17:31.500 --> 17:34.367
That started me
thinking.

17:34.433 --> 17:37.533
Enrique, you ever feel like
you've lost your appetite

17:37.600 --> 17:38.934
for all of the bullshit?

17:39.000 --> 17:40.834
- Yeah.

17:40.900 --> 17:42.934
When my sister died
in that bus accident.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.700
- That's right.

17:44.767 --> 17:46.767
You were talking peace
and patience back then.

17:46.834 --> 17:48.166
What happened?

17:48.233 --> 17:50.400
- Oz.

17:50.467 --> 17:53.066
Oz is what happened.

17:53.133 --> 17:55.867
Fucking Oz.

18:14.667 --> 18:17.266
- Now the Italians,
they got a whole 'nother way

18:17.333 --> 18:18.900
of thinking about
life after death.

18:18.967 --> 18:22.967
This Dante dude describes hell
as a series of little circles

18:23.033 --> 18:24.867
where sinners are tormented
by a punishment

18:24.934 --> 18:26.600
that reflects their crime.

18:26.667 --> 18:29.700
Flatterers are buried up
to their necks in shit.

18:29.767 --> 18:31.867
Lawyers wear clothes
that never stop itching.

18:31.934 --> 18:33.800
Just think on it.

18:33.867 --> 18:36.600
What would be the one thing
that would torture you

18:36.667 --> 18:38.200
for all of eternity.

18:38.266 --> 18:40.500
Your mother-in-law?

18:40.567 --> 18:42.700
Britney Spears' singing?

18:42.767 --> 18:44.300
For me,

18:44.367 --> 18:47.100
it'd be a big pair of tits

18:47.166 --> 18:50.367
just hanging out of my reach.

18:50.433 --> 18:51.533
Damn!

18:56.700 --> 18:58.400
- Count!

18:58.467 --> 19:00.967
- Let's go!

19:07.567 --> 19:09.533
Morning, Bob.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.066
Bob?

19:13.133 --> 19:16.033
You feeling any better?

19:20.367 --> 19:21.533
Hmm.

19:21.600 --> 19:23.600
- Redding, Burns.

19:23.667 --> 19:26.700
Number 0-1-R-2-8-9.

19:26.767 --> 19:28.333
Rebadow, Robert.

19:28.400 --> 19:31.967
Number 6-5-R-8-1-4.

19:32.033 --> 19:34.667
Busmalis,
where's Rebadow?

19:37.867 --> 19:40.867
- Grief's like a wave.
You've gotta ride it out.

19:40.934 --> 19:44.600
and as badly as you feel now,
I can tell you,

19:44.667 --> 19:46.133
you're in better shape
than you were

19:46.200 --> 19:48.100
the day your grandson died.

19:48.166 --> 19:51.133
- That's hard for me to accept
because

19:51.200 --> 19:54.600
the sadness I feel
keeps morphing.

19:54.667 --> 19:56.367
This morning,
or should I say last night

19:56.433 --> 20:00.700
since I barely sleep,
I became consumed with the fact

20:00.767 --> 20:04.233
that the Rebadow name will die.

20:04.300 --> 20:07.333
I was the only son.
My son is my only child.

20:07.400 --> 20:10.633
His son was his only child.

20:10.700 --> 20:13.800
After we're gone,
the family will become extinct

20:13.867 --> 20:17.934
like some species of insect
destroyed by pollution.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.333
My pollution.

20:19.400 --> 20:20.967
- I--I don't know why
we have such a thing

20:21.033 --> 20:23.066
about passing on our names.

20:23.133 --> 20:25.500
As if that somehow
justifies our existence.

20:25.567 --> 20:28.100
- My grandson's illness
filled up so much of my time,

20:28.166 --> 20:30.433
so much of my heart.

20:30.500 --> 20:32.233
His death has left an emptiness.

20:32.300 --> 20:34.367
- You need to keep busy,
you know.

20:34.433 --> 20:36.166
Focus on your job.

20:36.233 --> 20:38.400
You like working
in the dress factory, don't you?

20:38.467 --> 20:40.400
- No, not at all.

20:40.467 --> 20:41.834
The thought of hearing
the hideous hum

20:41.900 --> 20:43.667
of those machines
day in and day out.

20:43.734 --> 20:46.033
- Okay, I'll transfer you.

20:46.100 --> 20:48.700
Where would you prefer
to punch the clock?

20:48.767 --> 20:51.467
- I'm not--

20:51.533 --> 20:53.567
I love to read.

20:53.633 --> 20:56.400
The library?

20:56.467 --> 21:00.967
- So that's what's allocated
in the current budget.

21:01.033 --> 21:02.767
- Can you get more?

21:02.834 --> 21:04.567
- I can try.

21:04.633 --> 21:06.867
- Leo?
- Tim.

21:06.934 --> 21:08.867
Meet the new head librarian,
Stella Coffo.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.600
Tim McManus.
- Hello.

21:10.667 --> 21:11.867
- Hi.

21:11.934 --> 21:14.000
I heard you two
were having a meeting.

21:14.066 --> 21:15.767
- Stella comes to us from Boston

21:15.834 --> 21:17.567
where she worked
in the public library system

21:17.633 --> 21:19.166
for 16 years.

21:19.233 --> 21:21.433
- Yeah, I gotta admit
I'm a little curious

21:21.500 --> 21:22.633
as to why you're here.

21:22.700 --> 21:24.867
- You mean why leave
the comfort of Boston

21:24.934 --> 21:27.333
for the wilds of Oswald?

21:27.400 --> 21:29.734
Well, it's simple,
I love to read,

21:29.800 --> 21:32.800
and if I can get the men in
this prison to pick up a book,

21:32.867 --> 21:35.834
maybe their lives will be
changed in some small way.

21:35.900 --> 21:38.633
- Admirable goal.
Tough task.

21:38.700 --> 21:40.500
- Well, I'm from the North End.

21:40.567 --> 21:42.667
To me, "no" only means
"try harder."

21:42.734 --> 21:44.100
- Oh, good.

21:44.166 --> 21:47.934
Um, look, I--I hate to do this
on your first day,

21:48.000 --> 21:49.567
but I need a favor.

21:49.633 --> 21:50.800
- Sure, anything.

21:50.867 --> 21:53.700
- Uh, There's a prisoner
named Rebadow.

21:57.200 --> 21:59.934
- Here goes.

22:04.533 --> 22:06.166
Well, first in line.

22:06.233 --> 22:09.500
I guess you heard the
John Grisham finally arrived.

22:09.567 --> 22:11.433
- Oh, I don't read that tripe.

22:11.500 --> 22:14.400
- Sorry, I didn't mean
to offend you.

22:14.467 --> 22:16.433
- You Mrs. Coffo?

22:16.500 --> 22:18.967
- Miss Coffo, actually.

22:19.033 --> 22:21.166
- Name's Rebadow.

22:21.233 --> 22:23.467
I've been assigned
to work with you.

22:23.533 --> 22:26.100
But I'm no acolyte.

22:26.166 --> 22:28.500
I know where every decimal
in the Dewey System is.

22:28.567 --> 22:31.734
Ask me which shelf a book is on,
I'll point to it.

22:31.800 --> 22:33.600
- Excellent.

22:33.667 --> 22:35.166
I should warn you, though,

22:35.233 --> 22:38.400
I'm not gonna sit on my ass and
wait for the men to come to me.

22:38.467 --> 22:41.667
I want to identify the ones
who have no interest in reading,

22:41.734 --> 22:43.667
the ones who maybe
don't even know how to read.

22:43.734 --> 22:46.567
I want to put a book
in their hands,

22:46.633 --> 22:48.500
and finding the right book
is the key.

22:48.567 --> 22:50.233
That's where
I'm gonna lean on you.

22:50.300 --> 22:54.000
- You have my full support.

22:54.066 --> 22:55.633
- Do you have a first name,
Mr. Rebadow?

22:55.700 --> 22:57.500
- Robert.

22:57.567 --> 23:00.767
Though most of the jokers
in Oz call me Bob.

23:00.834 --> 23:02.200
- Well,
I'll call you Robert then,

23:02.266 --> 23:04.066
and you can call me Stella.

23:04.133 --> 23:07.600
I'm very pleased
to have you on board.

23:13.800 --> 23:16.266
- Hey, Cyril, we're meeting
with your new lawyer today.

23:16.333 --> 23:19.033
Some big hotshot
that Meehan found.

23:19.100 --> 23:20.633
- Can I come with you now?

23:20.700 --> 23:22.133
- No, not yet,
but soon, all right?

23:22.200 --> 23:25.000
- Sound awful optimistic there,
O'Reily.

23:25.066 --> 23:27.600
- I'm trying, Keller,
but optimism isn't exactly my--

23:27.667 --> 23:29.433
what's the word I'm looking for?
Forte.

23:29.500 --> 23:31.500
-Yo, can I get
some fucking food?

23:31.567 --> 23:34.667
- Eat that,
you hairy bitch.

23:34.734 --> 23:36.200
- Hey, everyone.

23:36.266 --> 23:38.233
Meet the new member
of our clubhouse.

23:38.300 --> 23:40.266
- Kirk, you fucking cocksucker!

23:40.333 --> 23:42.166
You should be dead,
you little fucking prick!

23:42.233 --> 23:43.667
- Don't be angry, Jaz-man.

23:43.734 --> 23:45.600
It's not your fault
that I'm alive.

23:45.667 --> 23:47.734
The truth is,
I can't die.

23:47.800 --> 23:50.834
- Bullshit.
Just give me another chance.

23:52.066 --> 23:54.700
- Won't do any good.
I can't die.

23:54.767 --> 23:56.333
- Yeah, why is that, pumpkin?

23:56.400 --> 23:57.767
- Because...

23:57.834 --> 23:59.934
I am Satan,

24:00.000 --> 24:03.166
and Satan will never die.

24:10.066 --> 24:11.867
- Good morning, Pete.

24:11.934 --> 24:13.166
- Ray.

24:13.233 --> 24:14.900
Oh, boy.

24:14.967 --> 24:17.066
I'm so glad you're back.
- Thank you.

24:17.133 --> 24:18.867
I would say
I'm happy to be back,

24:18.934 --> 24:22.500
but I'm not sure yet.

24:22.567 --> 24:24.100
- There's something
you should know.

24:24.166 --> 24:26.066
Timothy Kirk has been
transferred to death row

24:26.133 --> 24:29.266
and he's asked to see you.

24:29.333 --> 24:31.900
- No chance.
- Alright, now look.

24:31.967 --> 24:34.700
- Pete, two of the priests
from my parish

24:34.767 --> 24:36.700
were burned alive in that fire.

24:36.767 --> 24:38.600
A fire that Kirk arranged
and paid for

24:38.667 --> 24:40.233
out of spite and malice.

24:40.300 --> 24:42.200
- In a few weeks,
he's going to be executed.

24:42.266 --> 24:44.934
He may need
to make peace with you.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.233
His soul--
- His soul will rot in hell.

24:48.300 --> 24:50.433
- Ray, only God can decide that.

24:57.900 --> 25:01.633
- Uh-oh, Holy Ghost on deck.

25:01.700 --> 25:03.567
- Say hello, Jericho.

25:03.633 --> 25:04.967
Hello, father.

25:05.033 --> 25:06.400
- Yo, Mukada.

25:06.467 --> 25:08.633
Look at that fucking jizzball
sitting there.

25:08.700 --> 25:12.533
I'm gonna fucking kill you,
cocksucker.

25:14.100 --> 25:15.467
- Thank you so much
for the meeting.

25:15.533 --> 25:16.834
- Don't get used to it.

25:16.900 --> 25:18.900
- I have to talk fast,
before he comes back.

25:18.967 --> 25:21.166
- Who?
Lopresti?

25:21.233 --> 25:23.033
- Satan.

25:23.100 --> 25:25.834
Father, look,
I know that you hate me

25:25.900 --> 25:28.266
and I know that I've committed
all these horrible acts,

25:28.333 --> 25:32.166
but it's not me
who's done them.

25:32.233 --> 25:34.100
I am possessed by the devil.

25:34.166 --> 25:36.467
- Stop.
- I am possessed,

25:36.533 --> 25:38.900
and you are the only one
who can help me.

25:38.967 --> 25:39.967
I need an exorcism.

25:40.033 --> 25:41.900
- I said stop.

25:41.967 --> 25:45.500
Do you think I can't see through
this little performance?

25:45.567 --> 25:47.967
What, are you trying for an
insanity defense on your appeal?

25:48.033 --> 25:51.633
- No, Father, please.
He's coming.

25:51.700 --> 25:54.133
- By even suggesting
what you're suggesting,

25:54.200 --> 25:57.567
you make a mockery
of my religion.

25:57.633 --> 26:00.600
Goodbye, Kirk.

26:00.667 --> 26:03.266
I'll see you the day you die.

26:04.367 --> 26:06.367
- Mukada!

26:06.433 --> 26:08.867
You can walk away,

26:08.934 --> 26:12.800
but I'm not like
the Reverend Cloutier.

26:12.867 --> 26:15.400
I won't just disappear.

26:24.433 --> 26:26.367
- We work with criminals.

26:26.433 --> 26:28.934
We try to understand the reasons
why they broke the law

26:29.000 --> 26:30.767
so we can help them.

26:30.834 --> 26:33.633
We examine
the psychological elements,

26:33.700 --> 26:34.867
the sociological,

26:34.934 --> 26:36.800
we consider
their family backgrounds,

26:36.867 --> 26:39.767
environments, addictions,
blah, blah, blah.

26:39.834 --> 26:43.567
Usually there's an answer,
if not a cure.

26:43.633 --> 26:47.300
But sometimes we come
face-to-face with a larger,

26:47.367 --> 26:49.066
more stunning reality.

26:49.133 --> 26:51.700
We come face-to-face

26:51.767 --> 26:54.200
with pure evil.

26:54.266 --> 26:56.333
And we are powerless.

26:56.400 --> 26:59.433
I believe that Kirk has
no hope for salvation.

26:59.500 --> 27:02.533
He is pure evil.

27:02.600 --> 27:05.266
- I don't disagree that
there's evil in the world.

27:05.333 --> 27:08.433
I do disagree that
we're powerless against it.

27:08.500 --> 27:11.867
Ray, you and I have
dedicated our lives

27:11.934 --> 27:15.900
to overcoming evil through love.

27:15.967 --> 27:18.333
God's love.

27:18.400 --> 27:20.967
- Come in.

27:21.033 --> 27:22.133
- Hello, Ray.

27:22.200 --> 27:24.433
- Oh, Monsignor.

27:24.500 --> 27:26.767
Sister Peter Marie,
this is Monsignor Slon,

27:26.834 --> 27:28.467
vicar general
of the archdiocese.

27:28.533 --> 27:30.867
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you, Sister.

27:30.934 --> 27:32.166
I'm sorry to interrupt,

27:32.233 --> 27:33.667
but this is a matter
of some importance.

27:33.734 --> 27:36.433
- Well, I have a session.
Pleasure.

27:38.133 --> 27:40.533
- Can I get you
some tea or...?

27:40.600 --> 27:43.333
- No, thanks.
Uh, let's sit.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.967
- Sure.

27:48.567 --> 27:50.033
How's Cardinal Abgott?

27:50.100 --> 27:53.133
- Troubled,
and that's why I've come.

27:53.200 --> 27:55.700
His Eminence received
a letter yesterday

27:55.767 --> 28:01.600
from a prisoner here at Oswald.
Timothy Kirk.

28:01.667 --> 28:03.300
- Monsignor,
you've gotta understand

28:03.367 --> 28:05.300
there's a lot of history
between Kirk and me.

28:05.367 --> 28:06.800
- So it seems.

28:06.867 --> 28:10.800
Ray, Kirk claims you
sexually abused him.

28:10.867 --> 28:11.967
- What?

28:12.033 --> 28:14.000
- These are dicey times,

28:14.066 --> 28:17.600
and even though Kirk
is no parochial schoolboy,

28:17.667 --> 28:21.033
the church can't afford either
spiritually or financially

28:21.100 --> 28:24.000
to have any more
of our priests be suspect.

28:24.066 --> 28:26.700
- Monsignor, Kirk is lying.

28:26.767 --> 28:28.033
- I believe you.

28:28.100 --> 28:29.600
So does the cardinal.

28:29.667 --> 28:32.200
But if Kirk goes public
with his accusations,

28:32.266 --> 28:33.767
we have to be ready.

28:33.834 --> 28:35.900
Which is why,
until we investigate,

28:35.967 --> 28:37.433
I'm suspending you.

28:37.500 --> 28:40.700
We'll handle the investigation
as quickly as possible,

28:40.767 --> 28:43.533
but as of this moment,
you are no longer allowed

28:43.600 --> 28:46.900
to perform any functions
as a Catholic priest.

28:54.767 --> 28:58.300
I'm sorry, Ray.

29:07.500 --> 29:10.133
- Pure evil.

29:23.834 --> 29:25.000
- I was very happy

29:25.066 --> 29:26.500
with the variety show
you put together,

29:26.567 --> 29:28.767
and I'm hoping
you'll produce another one.

29:28.834 --> 29:30.433
- Oh, thank you, Leo.

29:30.500 --> 29:33.600
Um, actually, I'd really like
to do more with the prisoners

29:33.667 --> 29:37.400
than just singing and dancing,
so I was thinking Shakespeare.

29:37.467 --> 29:38.800
"Macbeth."

29:38.867 --> 29:40.133
- Sounds great.
- Yeah.

29:40.200 --> 29:42.500
- Sounds expensive.
- No, not necessarily.

29:42.567 --> 29:43.867
Because we would do
the production

29:43.934 --> 29:46.166
in modern dress
with minimal scenery,

29:46.233 --> 29:48.734
and that way the play
will be more accessible.

29:48.800 --> 29:51.033
- Can you work up a budget?
- As a matter of fact...

29:51.100 --> 29:54.333
We have one here.

29:54.400 --> 29:56.633
Leo, I don't want this to get
bogged down in bureaucracy.

29:56.700 --> 29:59.266
I'd like to start next week
holding auditions

29:59.333 --> 30:01.100
and putting together a crew.

30:01.166 --> 30:02.400
- You know,
the hardest part's gonna be

30:02.467 --> 30:04.166
getting these jamokes
to participate.

30:04.233 --> 30:06.300
- And that's why
we are so lucky

30:06.367 --> 30:08.233
that we have you
for the motivation, Tim.

30:09.934 --> 30:13.266
- We're not looking
for Denzel Washington here.

30:13.333 --> 30:16.166
The point is to give you
a place to channel your emotions

30:16.233 --> 30:18.400
other than fighting
or heroin,

30:18.467 --> 30:21.066
and not everyone has to be
in front of the footlights.

30:21.133 --> 30:23.367
Suzanne needs a stage manager,

30:23.433 --> 30:27.033
lighting, props, scenery,
the whole enchilada.

30:27.100 --> 30:30.233
So I expect a strong
representation from Em City.

30:30.300 --> 30:32.967
Get involved.

30:33.033 --> 30:35.367
Chuckie, what about you?

30:35.433 --> 30:38.333
- Plays are for fags.

30:38.400 --> 30:39.767
- Miguel, Miguel.

30:39.834 --> 30:42.633
Come on, this is a chance
to show everybody the new you.

30:42.700 --> 30:44.867
- No, I think I'd be
a little embarrassed

30:44.934 --> 30:46.133
to be in front of people.

30:46.200 --> 30:47.967
-So, be a stage manager.

30:48.033 --> 30:49.300
- What the fuck do they do?

30:49.367 --> 30:51.066
- Boss everyone else around.

30:51.133 --> 30:53.533
- Really?

30:53.600 --> 30:55.667
Alright, I'm in, yeah.
- Okay, good.

30:55.734 --> 30:58.433
Hey, how about props?

30:58.500 --> 31:01.667
- "Here I have a pilot's thumb,

31:01.734 --> 31:05.200
wracked as--as homeward
he did come."

31:05.266 --> 31:06.767
- That's very good, Poet.

31:06.834 --> 31:08.300
- What the fuck am I saying?

31:10.200 --> 31:14.233
- You are telling your friends
how you destroyed your enemy.

31:14.300 --> 31:16.367
- Really?
- Yeah.

31:16.433 --> 31:18.367
- A'ight.

31:18.433 --> 31:21.567
So in the real play,
can I get a real thumb?

31:21.633 --> 31:22.934
- You got anybody in mind?

31:23.000 --> 31:24.433
- Maybe yours, cheeseball.

31:24.500 --> 31:26.100
- What'd you say, cum stain?
- Hey, hey...

31:26.166 --> 31:28.567
- What?
- Settle the fuck down!

31:30.867 --> 31:32.734
- How goes it, Ma?
- Well, if I could keep 'em

31:32.800 --> 31:34.834
from killing each other
I think I've got all my actors,

31:34.900 --> 31:36.333
except for Macbeth,

31:36.400 --> 31:38.066
so I was thinking, Ryan--
- Sorry.

31:38.133 --> 31:39.734
- Ryan, you'd be brilliant
in the part.

31:39.800 --> 31:41.433
- I love you, Ma, but, uh-uh.
No way.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.266
- Oh, you got no balls,
O'Whitey?

31:43.333 --> 31:45.567
- I don't see you strutting
your stuff there, Pepe.

31:45.633 --> 31:47.700
- Dick.
- Oh, come on, Ryan.

31:47.767 --> 31:49.266
It could be fun.

31:49.333 --> 31:51.467
I did the part once
at the C.Y.O.

31:51.533 --> 31:56.467
Let's see now.
"Stay, you imperfect speakers,

31:56.533 --> 31:58.200
"and tell me more.

31:58.266 --> 32:02.266
"By Sinel's death
I am thane of Glamis,

32:02.333 --> 32:04.800
"but how of Cawdor?

32:04.867 --> 32:09.433
"The thane of Cawdor lives
a prosperous gentleman,

32:09.500 --> 32:13.934
"and to be king stands not
within the prospect of belief.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.233
"Say from whence you owe

32:17.300 --> 32:21.300
"this strange intelligence?

32:22.734 --> 32:26.233
Speak, I charge you!"

32:26.300 --> 32:28.166
- Father Meehan,
that was excellent!

32:28.233 --> 32:30.700
Now how would you
like to play Macbeth?

32:30.767 --> 32:33.533
- Me?
- Yeah.

32:33.600 --> 32:35.233
- Lights out.

32:35.300 --> 32:36.467
Nighty-night, boys.

32:43.266 --> 32:46.533
- Amen.
- Well, it's about time.

32:46.600 --> 32:49.667
- Ah, the power of prayer
is a wonderful thing, Ryan.

32:49.734 --> 32:51.867
- You know, when I was a kid
I'd bend my knees and ask God

32:51.934 --> 32:53.800
to stop Dad from beating on us.

32:53.867 --> 32:55.233
God never answered his pager.

32:55.300 --> 32:57.600
- A prayer's more
than asking for something.

32:57.667 --> 33:00.767
It centers you,
gives you peace of mind.

33:00.834 --> 33:02.800
Pray with me.

33:02.867 --> 33:05.700
No, I figure between you,
Sister Pete, and Aunt Brenda,

33:05.767 --> 33:07.967
I'm covered.

33:08.033 --> 33:09.667
- It would give me profound joy

33:09.734 --> 33:12.600
if someday you would join me
in prayer.

33:12.667 --> 33:13.900
- Well, it would
give me profound joy

33:13.967 --> 33:15.300
to fuck an 18-year-old virgin,

33:15.367 --> 33:18.100
so save your lungs,
okay, Father?

33:18.166 --> 33:20.467
- Naughty.

33:26.133 --> 33:28.100
- What you have to remember

33:28.166 --> 33:31.533
is that this is about power.

33:31.600 --> 33:33.700
You cannot let these people

33:33.767 --> 33:37.333
take your power away from you.

33:38.567 --> 33:40.667
Remember, Cyril,

33:40.734 --> 33:43.400
you are the center

33:43.467 --> 33:46.533
of the universe.

33:49.166 --> 33:52.667
What the fuck you looking at?

34:06.600 --> 34:08.000
- So you're the new lawyer?

34:08.066 --> 34:10.200
- Arnold Zelman.
- You want to explain to me

34:10.266 --> 34:12.834
why my brother is still
sitting on death row?

34:12.900 --> 34:14.667
Eight months ago,
the supreme court ruled that

34:14.734 --> 34:17.834
executing the mentally retarded
was unconstitutional.

34:17.900 --> 34:20.500
- Each state has the right
to determine for itself

34:20.567 --> 34:23.000
how retarded is defined.

34:23.066 --> 34:25.166
Our assemblymen
have been squabbling

34:25.233 --> 34:26.600
over a definition all this time.

34:26.667 --> 34:28.767
Yesterday, they finally managed
to reach an agreement.

34:28.834 --> 34:30.000
- Which is?

34:30.066 --> 34:32.266
- Well, basically
to qualify as retarded,

34:32.333 --> 34:33.934
a person has
to have demonstrated

34:34.000 --> 34:36.967
some sign of retardation
before the age of 18.

34:37.033 --> 34:38.900
- 18?

34:38.967 --> 34:40.967
But Cyril wasn't hit in the head
until his late 20s.

34:41.033 --> 34:42.967
- Well, that's why
he can still be executed.

34:43.033 --> 34:45.767
- Oh, fuck.

34:45.834 --> 34:47.800
All right,
so what do we do next?

34:47.867 --> 34:50.233
- Appeal Cyril's conviction.
At the first trial,

34:50.300 --> 34:52.066
the prosecution was able
to make the case

34:52.133 --> 34:54.266
that Cyril's attack
on Li Chen was premeditated.

34:54.333 --> 34:55.633
- Yeah, but it wasn't.

34:55.700 --> 34:57.667
- Well, in the appeal,
we have to prove it wasn't.

34:57.734 --> 34:58.834
I'm going to start

34:58.900 --> 35:01.200
by reinterviewing
all of the witnesses.

35:01.266 --> 35:02.734
- Great.

35:02.800 --> 35:05.600
Those fucks in Em City,
they got no reason to help me.

35:05.667 --> 35:08.800
- All we need is one, Ryan.

35:14.967 --> 35:18.233
- Prisoner number 9-9-S-9-1-7,

35:18.300 --> 35:20.300
Glen Shupe.

35:36.066 --> 35:40.333
Convicted April 22nd, 1999,
manslaughter.

35:40.400 --> 35:42.600
Sentence: 15 years,

35:42.667 --> 35:46.200
up for parole in eight.

35:46.266 --> 35:49.266
- Hey, Shupe, you need a hand?

35:49.333 --> 35:50.734
- Stay away from me!

35:50.800 --> 35:52.633
- Oh, why you so testy, man?

35:52.700 --> 35:54.133
- It's 'cause of you
I'm like this.

35:54.200 --> 35:56.600
- Uh-uh, no way, not me.
Spics chopped you up.

35:56.667 --> 35:58.133
- On your say-so.

35:58.200 --> 36:00.734
Hello, Mom.
- Hup.

36:00.800 --> 36:03.500
Look, whether I did or didn't
have anything to do with your--

36:03.567 --> 36:04.934
what's the word
I'm looking for there, Glen?

36:05.000 --> 36:07.400
Ah, disability, know this,

36:07.467 --> 36:09.433
a lawyer's gonna be coming
around asking people questions

36:09.500 --> 36:10.900
about the day
Li Chen got whacked

36:10.967 --> 36:13.600
and unless you want to be
dialing with your nose,

36:13.667 --> 36:16.033
you'd best tell him
what he wants to hear.

36:16.100 --> 36:18.266
You got that,
you stupid bitch?

36:23.266 --> 36:27.767
- I'm here to talk about the day
Cyril O'Reily attacked Li Chen.

36:27.834 --> 36:29.700
Now I know you've had
several conversations

36:29.767 --> 36:31.967
with various
law enforcement officers,

36:32.033 --> 36:34.633
prosecutors
and defense attorneys,

36:34.700 --> 36:36.333
and I know you've testified

36:36.400 --> 36:38.533
that you saw nothing
and know nothing

36:38.600 --> 36:41.800
of the circumstances
surrounding Li's death,

36:41.867 --> 36:44.500
but since I only recently
jumped onto this case,

36:44.567 --> 36:45.567
I'm hoping you may--

36:45.633 --> 36:48.133
- I know exactly what happened.

36:48.200 --> 36:49.667
- You do?

36:49.734 --> 36:51.500
- Ryan and Li had a scuffle.

36:51.567 --> 36:55.066
A knife fell to the floor,
probably Li's knife,

36:55.133 --> 36:57.900
and Cyril stabbed Li
spontaneously

36:57.967 --> 36:59.900
to save his brother's life.

36:59.967 --> 37:02.166
There was nothing premeditated
about Cyril's actions.

37:02.233 --> 37:04.934
Nothing.
- Mr. Shupe,

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
have you talked
to anyone else recently

37:07.066 --> 37:09.200
about these events?

37:09.266 --> 37:11.066
I mean, has anyone prepped you?

37:11.133 --> 37:12.967
- No, sir.

37:13.033 --> 37:14.367
It's what I saw

37:14.433 --> 37:17.133
and I wanna testify
to that in court.

37:17.200 --> 37:20.000
- Do you know that you can get
five more years for perjury?

37:20.066 --> 37:22.567
- Mr. Zelman,
I'm already serving 15.

37:22.633 --> 37:25.400
I'm not afraid.

37:25.467 --> 37:27.867
- So how's it going
interviewing the witnesses?

37:27.934 --> 37:29.734
- So far, not so good.

37:29.800 --> 37:30.967
- What about Shupe?

37:31.033 --> 37:32.567
- He's not very credible.

37:32.633 --> 37:34.967
- Shupe is a compulsive liar.

37:35.033 --> 37:37.800
The irony is that this time,
he's telling the truth.

37:37.867 --> 37:40.033
- Well, then use him.
- If I put Shupe on the stand,

37:40.100 --> 37:41.600
the jury won't believe
a word he's saying.

37:41.667 --> 37:43.734
He'll do more damage than good.

37:43.800 --> 37:45.834
- So you'll find
a credible witness.

37:45.900 --> 37:47.600
- I hope.
I'm down to my last few guys.

37:47.667 --> 37:49.266
- So how, more rallies...
- What do we do next?

37:49.333 --> 37:51.300
- Turn up the heat.
The press and the public

37:51.367 --> 37:53.066
have shown a keen interest
in this case.

37:53.133 --> 37:55.100
I'll use my contacts
to network.

37:59.400 --> 38:01.367
- Hey, Petey,
you out of the psych unit?

38:01.433 --> 38:03.900
Did you work out
all your "inner demons"?

38:08.033 --> 38:09.800
- I heard something
from a very reliable source

38:09.867 --> 38:12.600
yesterday, O'Reily.
- Oh, yeah?

38:12.667 --> 38:14.467
What'd you hear?

38:14.533 --> 38:17.033
- That you ground up glass
and put it in my father's food,

38:17.100 --> 38:18.900
cut his insides up slowly.

38:18.967 --> 38:22.100
You're responsible
for my father being dead.

38:22.166 --> 38:24.934
- Well, what you heard is true,

38:25.000 --> 38:26.333
except for one little detail.

38:26.400 --> 38:28.200
Adebisi did the deed.
It wasn't me.

38:28.266 --> 38:29.633
I was your father's friend.

38:29.700 --> 38:31.433
Hey, who's your reliable source,
huh?

38:31.500 --> 38:33.300
Some nut job
from the whack shack?

38:33.367 --> 38:34.433
- Never mind.

38:34.500 --> 38:36.367
I'll tell you who he is,
he's dead.

38:36.433 --> 38:38.233
- Fair enough.

38:38.300 --> 38:40.066
But what if what
you say is true?

38:40.133 --> 38:41.567
Which it isn't.

38:41.633 --> 38:43.633
What the fuck's
a little prag like you

38:43.700 --> 38:46.200
gonna do about it anyhow, huh?

38:46.266 --> 38:47.633
Now back the fuck away from me.

38:47.700 --> 38:51.400
You stink like anchovies.

38:57.500 --> 38:59.533
- I have to admit I'm stunned.

38:59.600 --> 39:02.000
I've been trying for months to
get to you to visit your wife,

39:02.066 --> 39:04.266
and now all of a sudden
you wanna see her?

39:04.333 --> 39:06.867
- Well, like I said, Sister,
I'm feeling better about myself.

39:06.934 --> 39:09.033
With you
and Father Meehan's help, I--

39:09.100 --> 39:11.967
- I had a long talk
with Rosalie yesterday.

39:12.033 --> 39:13.633
- But you didn't tell her
what happened to me, right?

39:13.700 --> 39:15.667
- No, I'm just gonna
wait for you to find

39:15.734 --> 39:18.700
the right time to tell her.

39:34.533 --> 39:35.900
- "A drum, a drum!

39:35.967 --> 39:38.300
"Macbeth doth come.

39:38.367 --> 39:41.600
"The weird sisters,
hand in hand,

39:41.667 --> 39:44.467
"posters of the sea and land,

39:44.533 --> 39:47.934
"thus do go about, about.

39:48.000 --> 39:51.533
"Thrice to thine
and thrice to mine,

39:51.600 --> 39:54.834
"and thrice again
to make up nine.

39:54.900 --> 39:56.266
"Peace!

39:56.333 --> 39:58.800
The charm's wound up!"

39:58.867 --> 40:03.567
- "So foul and fair a day
I have not seen."

40:03.633 --> 40:05.166
- "How far is it called
to Forres?"

40:05.233 --> 40:07.467
- All right, shut up!

40:07.533 --> 40:08.800
Time's up.

40:08.867 --> 40:10.533
- But I barely got a line out.

40:10.600 --> 40:13.800
- Tomorrow and tomorrow
and tomorrow, Agamemnon.

40:15.600 --> 40:18.133
- Ah, here comes
another volunteer.

40:18.200 --> 40:20.800
Mr. Peter Schibetta.
- Great.

40:20.867 --> 40:22.233
Hello, Peter.
- Hi.

40:22.300 --> 40:24.333
- Ryan could use some help
painting the scenery.

40:24.400 --> 40:26.867
- No, I don't need any help.
Especially his.

40:29.367 --> 40:30.767
You know, I seen
this play in high school.

40:30.834 --> 40:32.467
It's got all
these incantations, right?

40:32.533 --> 40:33.633
- Right.
- We Sicilians,

40:33.700 --> 40:36.333
we have our own version,
our own spells.

40:36.400 --> 40:40.000
The evil eye.
My wife's grandmother,

40:40.066 --> 40:43.200
she can give somebody evil eye
from a mile away.

40:43.266 --> 40:47.166
I'm not saying the stuff works,
but who knows, right?

40:47.233 --> 40:49.600
- I thought I told you
to back the fuck away.

40:49.667 --> 40:51.400
- No problem, cuz.

40:51.467 --> 40:53.300
No problem.

40:57.133 --> 40:59.633
- Ah, Ryan.

40:59.700 --> 41:01.200
Look, I know you've done things

41:01.266 --> 41:03.333
you're not
particularly proud of,

41:03.400 --> 41:05.934
but sometimes
if you talk things through--

41:06.000 --> 41:08.767
- Skip the preamble, Father.
What's on your mind?

41:08.834 --> 41:12.266
- All right.
Peter Schibetta.

41:12.333 --> 41:14.867
I've seen the way
you two look at each other.

41:14.934 --> 41:16.166
The hostility.

41:16.233 --> 41:17.800
- Schibetta's a corn hole.

41:17.867 --> 41:19.433
- For god's sake, Ryan.

41:19.500 --> 41:21.500
Will you knock off this bravado?

41:21.567 --> 41:23.834
This--this--this bullshit?

41:23.900 --> 41:26.367
Just for a moment.

41:26.433 --> 41:30.800
I know you think you have
to be hard to survive here,

41:30.867 --> 41:34.266
but there are other ways.

41:34.333 --> 41:36.633
I've seen you with your brother,

41:36.700 --> 41:40.200
there's love,
there's caring.

41:40.266 --> 41:43.000
There's goodness in you.

41:43.066 --> 41:45.100
Will you let that goodness rise

41:45.166 --> 41:49.066
and be the man that
God meant you to be?

41:51.667 --> 41:54.233
- How, Father?
- I'll help you.

41:54.300 --> 41:58.200
And we'll start
with your laundry.

41:58.266 --> 42:01.433
Now you think
you'd know by now

42:01.500 --> 42:04.100
that if you don't
separate your laundry,

42:04.166 --> 42:08.233
the colors will bleed.

42:10.600 --> 42:12.266
- In the Shona tribe in Africa,

42:12.333 --> 42:14.633
the living communicate
with Mwari,

42:14.700 --> 42:16.000
that's God,

42:16.066 --> 42:18.767
through their dead ancestors,
the Vadzimu.

42:18.834 --> 42:21.800
The Shona believe
that all around the living

42:21.867 --> 42:24.700
there's an invisible community
of Vadzimu

42:24.767 --> 42:27.600
watching and caring
for their descendants.

42:27.667 --> 42:29.734
But there's also Ngozi,

42:29.800 --> 42:31.500
evil spirits,

42:31.567 --> 42:33.767
the wronged,
the neglected,

42:33.834 --> 42:34.967
the murdered,

42:35.033 --> 42:36.867
who avenge themselves
on a family

42:36.934 --> 42:39.467
through sudden death.

42:46.700 --> 42:48.667
- Oh, Christ.

42:52.600 --> 42:54.467
Father!

42:54.533 --> 42:57.233
Ah, God, Father,
what's the matter with you?

42:57.300 --> 42:59.934
Father, what's the matter?

43:00.000 --> 43:01.633
Father!

43:01.700 --> 43:04.800
Father!
Shit.

43:04.867 --> 43:06.567
Help!
Help!

43:06.633 --> 43:08.200
Help!

43:08.266 --> 43:10.133
Come here, help!

43:10.200 --> 43:12.266
Help!

43:12.333 --> 43:14.166
- Bring in that crash cart!

43:14.233 --> 43:15.967
Four, five.

43:16.033 --> 43:18.967
One, two, three, four, five.

43:19.033 --> 43:20.500
Get the intubation tray.

43:27.600 --> 43:29.000
- How is he?

43:29.066 --> 43:30.166
- Father Meehan's dead.

43:30.233 --> 43:31.734
- Oh, fuck.

43:31.800 --> 43:33.400
- An aneurysm.

43:33.467 --> 43:34.934
He died almost immediately.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.533
- How did it happen?

43:36.600 --> 43:38.066
- Who knows?

43:38.133 --> 43:39.300
We'll do an autopsy,

43:39.367 --> 43:41.000
try to figure out the cause,
but...

43:41.066 --> 43:43.400
- But he'll still be dead,
right?

43:43.467 --> 43:46.000
- And yet, of all the ways
he could have died in Oz,

43:46.066 --> 43:49.000
God chose the most peaceful.

43:49.066 --> 43:51.033
Yeah, right.

43:51.100 --> 43:53.066
You know when I found Father
Meehan lying on the floor,

43:53.133 --> 43:55.400
he'd taken a shit
in his underwear.

43:55.467 --> 43:57.066
So what does that tell you
about us human beings?

43:57.133 --> 43:59.266
That the last thing we do
before we die is shit?

43:59.333 --> 44:02.300
- Ryan, have some respect
for the man.

44:02.367 --> 44:04.333
- I do!

44:05.233 --> 44:08.400
You know,
a couple of Sundays ago at mass,

44:08.467 --> 44:09.667
he read the part of the Gospel

44:09.734 --> 44:11.400
where after Jesus
was pulled off the cross

44:11.467 --> 44:14.834
his friends took the body down
and they washed it.

44:14.900 --> 44:17.600
I'd like to do that.

44:17.667 --> 44:21.233
I'd like to wash
Father Meehan's body.

44:21.300 --> 44:22.633
- Uh, I don't know.

44:22.700 --> 44:24.266
- Please.

44:24.333 --> 44:27.033
He wanted me to pray with him,
but I never did.

44:27.100 --> 44:28.934
Despite all that he tried to do
for me and Cyril.

44:29.000 --> 44:33.467
I...I owe the man this much.
Please.

reading all that small print.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.867
Small print's the best part.

45:35.934 --> 45:38.066
- Working on an appeal?

45:38.133 --> 45:39.300
- Yeah.

45:39.367 --> 45:41.100
Not for me.
For Chris Keller.

45:41.166 --> 45:43.100
I'm trying to overturn
his death sentence.

45:43.166 --> 45:45.233
I've got my dad
working on the case too.

45:45.300 --> 45:47.533
- You're a lawyer?

45:47.600 --> 45:48.600
- Used to be.

45:48.667 --> 45:50.867
- Mail call!

45:52.266 --> 45:54.000
- What you got for me there,
Winthrop?

45:54.066 --> 45:56.567
- Uh, "Newsweek"
and "Field and Stream".

45:56.633 --> 45:58.000
- Where's my "Swank"?

45:58.066 --> 46:01.333
- It got a little manhandled
in the mail room.

46:01.400 --> 46:02.867
Hey there, Beecher.

46:02.934 --> 46:05.800
Enjoying life in Unit "J"?

46:05.867 --> 46:07.767
- Beats bobbing for apples
with the Aryans.

46:12.867 --> 46:14.266
- Get off him, Beecher.
Come on!

46:14.333 --> 46:15.700
Break it up!
Break it up!

46:15.767 --> 46:16.900
- What'd you expect?

46:16.967 --> 46:19.567
You got Schillinger
sent to solitary.

46:22.266 --> 46:24.200
- For raping you.

46:24.266 --> 46:26.667
- I told you
I can take care of myself.

46:26.734 --> 46:28.066
I have plans.

46:28.133 --> 46:30.767
- What plans?

46:30.834 --> 46:33.934
- Have a nice visit
with your kids.

46:35.300 --> 46:37.433
- How'd you know
my kids were coming?

46:37.500 --> 46:38.700
Winthrop!

46:40.233 --> 46:41.867
- In a vote of six to one,

46:41.934 --> 46:44.033
we've decided
to release you from solitary

46:44.100 --> 46:45.767
with the understanding

46:45.834 --> 46:47.333
that if you attempt
another rape,

46:47.400 --> 46:49.667
you will be sent back there
permanently.

46:49.734 --> 46:51.200
- Let me guess.

46:51.266 --> 46:55.734
Sister, you were
the one dissenting vote?

46:55.800 --> 46:57.500
- Take him to Unit "B".

47:05.500 --> 47:08.800
That was nice, prag.

47:08.867 --> 47:10.233
- May--may I speak, sir?

47:10.300 --> 47:14.066
- Yeah--well,
wipe your mouth first.

47:15.200 --> 47:17.233
- I...

47:17.300 --> 47:19.700
I come from pure Aryan blood.

47:19.767 --> 47:22.266
I have an education.

47:22.333 --> 47:24.600
I can be of better use to you
than this.

47:24.667 --> 47:26.300
- You want to join
the brotherhood?

47:26.367 --> 47:27.800
- Yes.

47:27.867 --> 47:30.934
- Well, that'd be unusual.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.567
Usually a bitch
is a bitch is a bitch.

47:33.633 --> 47:35.233
- I have a plan.

47:35.300 --> 47:37.033
- That Ivy League mind at work?

47:37.100 --> 47:39.767
- If Beecher gets hurt
before his parole hearing,

47:39.834 --> 47:42.066
you go into solitary forever,
am I right?

47:42.133 --> 47:43.667
- Yeah.

47:43.734 --> 47:46.133
- Yet revenge on that scumfuck
is all you can ever think about.

47:46.200 --> 47:47.200
Am I right?

47:47.266 --> 47:48.934
- Your point?

47:49.000 --> 47:50.667
- I'll kill Beecher's father.

47:50.734 --> 47:52.433
- What?
- I'll cover my tracks,

47:52.500 --> 47:54.233
pay off the CO's,
and if I'm caught,

47:54.300 --> 47:56.533
I'll take sole blame.

47:56.600 --> 47:58.200
I can kill him--
I will kill him,

47:58.266 --> 48:01.467
if you promise me an upgrade.

48:01.533 --> 48:03.500
- Done.

48:09.867 --> 48:13.133
- My son, Harry,
is coming here today.

48:13.200 --> 48:15.200
It's the first time
I'll be seeing him in six years.

48:15.266 --> 48:17.500
- Six years?
- Yeah.

48:17.567 --> 48:19.367
After my wife died,

48:19.433 --> 48:21.834
my parents took the two oldest
and Genevieve's parents,

48:21.900 --> 48:24.300
they took Harry, the baby,
to live with them in San Diego.

48:24.367 --> 48:27.433
- Well, why haven't
you seen Harry in so long?

48:27.500 --> 48:29.834
- You know, everybody figured
it was for the best.

48:29.900 --> 48:31.967
- Horseshit.

48:32.033 --> 48:33.333
A child belongs with his father,

48:33.400 --> 48:37.000
even if his father is
behind bars.

48:38.467 --> 48:40.533
- Hello, son.
- Dad.

48:40.600 --> 48:42.400
- Oh.

48:42.467 --> 48:43.633
- Where are the kids?

48:43.700 --> 48:46.967
- I--I need to talk to you.

48:48.333 --> 48:50.200
- Guess I'll take a nap.

48:50.266 --> 48:53.300
Wake me up for shuffleboard.

48:53.367 --> 48:55.266
- Genevieve's parents
have been staying with us

48:55.333 --> 48:56.900
for the past week.

48:57.000 --> 48:58.400
Well, it was awkward at first,

48:58.467 --> 49:01.800
but Jonah and Margaret
have been working very hard

49:01.867 --> 49:04.633
to be--well,
to be a family again,

49:04.700 --> 49:07.900
to ease Harry
back into your life.

49:07.967 --> 49:09.300
- And?

49:09.367 --> 49:11.266
- Well, they're waiting
in the parking lot.

49:11.333 --> 49:13.900
Harry won't get out of the car.

49:16.633 --> 49:19.200
Oh, no.

49:23.066 --> 49:25.200
- Son, son.

49:25.266 --> 49:27.066
He's six years old.

49:27.133 --> 49:29.133
He's terrified.

49:29.200 --> 49:32.900
His crying is upsetting Holly.

49:32.967 --> 49:34.767
- It's okay, don't force him.

49:34.834 --> 49:37.800
- We'll try again tomorrow.

49:39.100 --> 49:40.200
- No.
No.

49:43.166 --> 49:45.033
Let's just hold off, okay?

49:45.100 --> 49:46.266
My parole hearing's on Thursday.

49:46.333 --> 49:48.166
If I get paroled,

49:48.233 --> 49:51.734
I can see him at home.
- Are you sure?

49:51.800 --> 49:53.934
- Yes, I can wait.

49:54.000 --> 49:55.033
I can wait.

49:55.100 --> 49:56.967
It's just a couple more days.

49:57.033 --> 49:58.066
- Right.

49:58.133 --> 50:00.333
This time I know
the parole board

50:00.400 --> 50:02.834
is going to let you out.
I know it !

50:02.900 --> 50:06.834
In the bottom of my heart,
I know that you will be free.

50:12.800 --> 50:15.166
So, uh...

50:15.233 --> 50:17.533
tell me,
how does he look, my son?

50:17.600 --> 50:20.867
- Oh, well...

50:21.900 --> 50:25.033
Like his father.

50:29.567 --> 50:32.533
He has his mother's eyes.

50:42.567 --> 50:46.433
So you're going to see Chris
to talk about the appeal, right?

50:46.500 --> 50:47.700
- Yes.

50:52.834 --> 50:54.734
- Will you give him my love?

51:02.300 --> 51:04.133
- Our current strategy
is to focus

51:04.200 --> 51:06.567
on the credibility
of the prosecution's eyewitness.

51:06.633 --> 51:09.367
Uh...
- Jerry Heekin.

51:09.433 --> 51:11.200
- We've just discovered that

51:11.266 --> 51:14.433
he'd been arrested twice
for dealing crack cocaine.

51:14.500 --> 51:16.266
- How come my other
motherfucking lawyer

51:16.333 --> 51:18.700
didn't know that?

51:18.767 --> 51:22.100
- Well, like the kids say,
he sucked.

51:28.500 --> 51:31.633
Gotta calm down there,
Mr. Beecher.

51:31.700 --> 51:34.000
Gum?
- No, thank you.

51:36.367 --> 51:37.767
- You don't like me, do you?

51:37.834 --> 51:39.734
That's beside the point.

51:39.800 --> 51:41.834
I don't have to like you
to defend you.

51:41.900 --> 51:45.233
And my son--
- Loves me.

51:45.300 --> 51:47.333
That bother you?

51:48.367 --> 51:50.166
- Yes.

51:50.233 --> 51:52.734
- That he loves a man
or that he loves me?

51:52.800 --> 51:54.066
- We're finished for the day.

51:54.133 --> 51:55.667
- Your Honor,
please instruct the witness

51:55.734 --> 51:57.333
to answer the question.

51:57.400 --> 51:59.166
- All right.

51:59.233 --> 52:01.834
I find you despicable.

52:01.900 --> 52:04.300
Happy?

52:10.133 --> 52:13.066
- Just another notch in my gun.

52:13.133 --> 52:15.000
- The trial
of Mayor Wilson Loewen

52:15.066 --> 52:17.233
continued today at
the Bankhead State Courthouse.

52:17.300 --> 52:19.133
Loewen was indicted
for his involvement

52:19.200 --> 52:20.867
in the 1963 murder

52:20.934 --> 52:24.033
of two 10-year-old
African-American girls.

52:24.100 --> 52:26.100
Prosecutors alleged that Loewen,

52:26.166 --> 52:28.734
who was the Jackson County
sheriff at the time,

52:28.800 --> 52:30.333
aided and abetted

52:30.400 --> 52:33.333
members of the Ku Klux Klan
in the brutal slaying.

52:39.367 --> 52:42.133
- I beg your pardon.

52:43.400 --> 52:45.467
Guard!

52:50.567 --> 52:52.200
Guard!
Guard!

52:52.266 --> 52:55.734
Guard!
Oh!

52:55.800 --> 52:57.133
No!
Ah!

53:03.767 --> 53:05.266
No.

53:14.433 --> 53:16.767
- These are live images
from the east side of the city.

53:16.834 --> 53:19.567
Looting and burning have
continued for several hours,

53:19.633 --> 53:21.400
sparked
by Governor James Devlin's

53:21.467 --> 53:22.800
off-the-record comment

53:22.867 --> 53:24.567
that he would pardon
Wilson Loewen

53:24.633 --> 53:25.967
if the mayor is convicted.

53:26.033 --> 53:27.700
- First, let me announce

53:27.767 --> 53:31.133
that we have put
the National Guard on alert,

53:31.200 --> 53:32.967
though I sincerely hope

53:33.033 --> 53:34.633
there'll be no need
to activate it.

53:34.700 --> 53:36.633
Let me stress that violence,
especially rioting...

53:36.700 --> 53:38.967
- We cannot lose control here.
I want the prison locked down.

53:39.033 --> 53:40.567
- It never solved anything.
- Now go on.

53:40.633 --> 53:42.033
- The only thing that's
got me more confused

53:42.100 --> 53:44.834
than the rioting itself
is the reason for it.

53:44.900 --> 53:47.133
I am an innocent man,

53:47.200 --> 53:50.834
and yet you are destroying
your stores, your cars,

53:50.900 --> 53:53.333
your neighborhoods,
all based on hearsay

53:53.400 --> 53:57.233
With regards to a verdict
that not only has yet passed,

53:57.300 --> 53:59.033
but that will ultimately...
- Stay calm

53:59.100 --> 54:01.734
and preferably indoors.
- My brothers and sisters,

54:01.800 --> 54:03.667
we must stop the violence
on our streets.

54:03.734 --> 54:05.567
- I have spent my life trying
to make it a better place...

54:05.633 --> 54:07.967
- By rioting, by looting,
by destroying...

54:08.033 --> 54:09.567
- And my heart breaks
to see my city being torn down.

54:09.633 --> 54:11.200
- We are doing more
to damage our community

54:11.266 --> 54:13.333
than Mayor Loewen has.
- I am an innocent man....

54:13.400 --> 54:15.400
- There's no victory to be won

54:15.467 --> 54:18.800
when we address hate with hate.

54:18.867 --> 54:20.834
Let us take back our city
with love...
