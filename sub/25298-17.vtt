[both groaning]

08:48.738 --> 08:50.740
Hey! You aren't
supposed to be in here!

08:50.740 --> 08:52.492
You two are
in big trouble!

08:52.492 --> 08:53.653
Come on, Tilly!

08:53.653 --> 08:54.824
Hey! Get back here!

08:54.824 --> 08:57.707
Gramma, maybe we should
turn ourselves in.

08:57.707 --> 08:59.659
Just when it's
getting good? Ha!

08:59.659 --> 09:01.751
-[Tilly whimpering]
-Come on! This way!

09:01.751 --> 09:03.463
[grunting]

09:04.794 --> 09:06.506
Excuse me!
Did you see a little girl

09:06.506 --> 09:08.628
and an old woman
run past here?

09:08.628 --> 09:09.629
Thanks!

09:09.629 --> 09:11.591
Wait...

09:11.591 --> 09:13.343
Ah-ha! Oh!

09:13.343 --> 09:15.175
[clears throat]
I'm so sorry.

09:15.175 --> 09:17.477
Hurry, Tilly.
We can escape
out this window.

09:17.477 --> 09:20.350
Stop! I'm not letting you
get away so easy!

09:20.350 --> 09:21.481
[grunts]

09:21.481 --> 09:23.983
[both scream, grunt]

09:23.983 --> 09:25.105
[both gasp]

09:25.105 --> 09:26.106
Dead end!

09:26.106 --> 09:29.189
I'm invoking Hotel Law!

09:29.189 --> 09:30.740
You're under arrest!

09:30.740 --> 09:33.493
Ha! In your dreams!
Yah!

09:33.493 --> 09:35.285
We're bustin' outta here!

09:35.285 --> 09:36.746
-Whoo-hoo!
-I will not rest

09:36.746 --> 09:38.458
until I bring you
to justice!

09:38.458 --> 09:40.370
Ooh!
It's my lunch break.

09:40.370 --> 09:42.702
[both laughing]

09:42.702 --> 09:45.125
Oh! We really
gave her the slip, huh?

09:45.125 --> 09:47.127
I am untouchable.

09:47.127 --> 09:48.878
Tilly, thank you
for showin'

09:48.878 --> 09:51.091
your old gramma
a good time
in the city.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.632
But I still don't get it.

09:52.632 --> 09:54.094
Why are you doin'
all this for me?

09:54.094 --> 09:56.806
Because, Gramma, if you just
give the city a chance,

09:56.806 --> 09:59.139
you'll see that
there's so much to love!

09:59.139 --> 10:02.642
-[cat hissing]
-[police siren]

10:02.642 --> 10:03.893
I hate to admit it,

10:03.893 --> 10:05.815
but I couldn't have done
any of this stuff

10:05.815 --> 10:07.317
without you
showing me the way.

10:07.317 --> 10:09.859
I'm just happy to help.

10:09.859 --> 10:11.731
Now, let's
get outta here.

10:11.731 --> 10:13.783
Gramma needs
her night bath.

10:13.783 --> 10:15.155

10:19.499 --> 10:21.371
[both] Phew!

10:21.371 --> 10:22.912
I can't believe it!

10:22.912 --> 10:23.663
Yeah, it looks...

10:25.705 --> 10:27.707
...exactly the same
as before. Hmm.

10:27.707 --> 10:29.549
Well, it might not be
any better,

10:29.549 --> 10:30.800
but at least
it's not any worse!

10:30.800 --> 10:33.463
[clock chiming]

10:33.463 --> 10:34.754
-[gasps] Gramma!
-[gasps] Ma!

10:34.754 --> 10:37.257
Hey, lazy bones!
We're home!

10:39.139 --> 10:40.890
Oh, uh, [chuckles]
hey, Ma!

10:40.890 --> 10:42.262
How'd you, uh,

10:42.262 --> 10:43.723
how'd your
Big City tour go?

10:43.723 --> 10:44.934
[grunts, chomps]

10:44.934 --> 10:45.935
[giggles]

10:45.935 --> 10:48.398
The tour went
just dandy.

10:48.398 --> 10:50.770
Tilly's got me on a kick
of tryin' new things.

10:50.770 --> 10:51.771
So you know what?

10:51.771 --> 10:53.943
After I take my night bath,

10:53.943 --> 10:56.946
I'll finally let you
renovate the bathroom.

10:56.946 --> 10:57.867
How's that sound?

10:57.867 --> 10:59.199
-Huh?!
-[spits]

11:02.542 --> 11:04.784
Whoo-hoo!
Finally here!

11:04.784 --> 11:08.748
Remy! You're just in time
for laundry basket sledding!

11:08.748 --> 11:10.550
[clucks]

11:10.550 --> 11:13.132
Never mind. Someone
won't cooperate.

11:13.132 --> 11:14.294
Sorry I was late, Cricket.

11:14.294 --> 11:15.755
[grunts] Yeah,
where you been?

11:15.755 --> 11:17.797
I had an
adventure-packed day!

11:17.797 --> 11:20.300
I went for tutoring,
violin lessons,

11:20.300 --> 11:21.891
junior dance team,
survivalist camp,

11:21.891 --> 11:23.183
jar decorating,

11:23.183 --> 11:25.305
and went to see a doctor
about that rash!

11:25.305 --> 11:29.769
And now, my parents say
I can stay until dinner time!

11:29.769 --> 11:30.940
Well, it's dinner time!

11:30.940 --> 11:31.981
See you later, Cricket!

11:31.981 --> 11:33.523
What? Seriously?

11:33.523 --> 11:35.154
Your parents always
keep you so busy.

11:35.154 --> 11:37.317
Wish there was a way
we could hang out more.

11:37.317 --> 11:39.409
Wait! Wait,
wait, wait!

11:39.409 --> 11:40.910
Imagine, Remy,

11:40.910 --> 11:44.994
If your family and my family
were best friends!

11:44.994 --> 11:47.877
Hey, Remy's dad!
I cooked this burger
just the way you like it.

11:47.877 --> 11:49.629
Thanks, Cricket's dad!

11:49.629 --> 11:51.331
That's why we're BFFs.

11:51.331 --> 11:53.633
[laughing] Buddy, ol' pal!

11:53.633 --> 11:55.545
-[laughing]
-[laughing] Alice, catch!

11:55.545 --> 11:56.796
[grunts, growling]

11:56.796 --> 11:57.887
-[all laughing]
-Hey, everybody!

11:57.887 --> 12:00.179
We should hang out all the time!

12:00.179 --> 12:01.471
Even better!

12:01.471 --> 12:04.394
We should all live
in our mansion!

12:04.394 --> 12:06.055
[laughing]

12:07.847 --> 12:09.769
-Oh, no.
-[all screaming]

12:09.769 --> 12:12.812
[shudders] Why did I even
imagine that last part?

12:12.812 --> 12:15.194
Getting our parents
to become friends sounds great!

12:15.194 --> 12:17.196
But how can we do that?

12:17.196 --> 12:18.658
Remy, let me
ask you something.

12:18.658 --> 12:20.990
Do you're parents
like to eat food?

12:20.990 --> 12:23.493
Dad! Help, I'm hurt real bad!
I need you!

12:23.493 --> 12:24.824
[pants] What is it, Boy?!

12:24.824 --> 12:25.825
Are you OK?!

12:25.825 --> 12:26.866
Yeah, yeah,
I'm fine.

12:26.866 --> 12:28.288
I wanted to get
your attention,

12:28.288 --> 12:29.999
but didn't wanna
go lookin' for ya.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.251
Anyway, can Remy's parents
come over for dinner?

12:31.251 --> 12:33.212
Please, Dad!
Please, Dad! Please!

12:33.212 --> 12:36.796
I suppose it would be nice
to meet the Remingtons!

12:36.796 --> 12:38.087
I'll give 'em a call.

12:38.087 --> 12:39.839
[grunts, sighs]

12:39.839 --> 12:41.471
Now we just
sit back, relax,

12:41.471 --> 12:44.183
and wait for our parents
to become super best friends.

12:44.183 --> 12:45.595
[Bill] That's right,
Mrs. Remington!

12:45.595 --> 12:46.886
Dinner at our place tonight.

12:46.886 --> 12:48.978
Oh, you don't have
to bring anything!

12:48.978 --> 12:49.979
[chomps]

12:49.979 --> 12:52.231
We got plenty of food.

12:52.231 --> 12:55.315
♪ A-brush, brush,
brushing the pig ♪

12:55.315 --> 12:57.066
[Gramma] Where are my clothes?!

12:57.066 --> 13:00.069
I can't find one shred
of clothing to cover my body!

13:00.069 --> 13:01.901
Whatever.
I'm coming out.

13:01.901 --> 13:04.744
[wincing] Are you sure
this dinner's a good idea?

13:04.744 --> 13:06.326
Our families are
pretty different.

13:06.326 --> 13:07.787
It's a great idea!

13:07.787 --> 13:09.078
Opposites attract!

13:09.078 --> 13:09.959
Take us, for example.

13:09.959 --> 13:11.671
I'm bold, funny,
and timely,

13:11.671 --> 13:13.833
-and you're the opposite!
-I guess so.

13:13.833 --> 13:15.875
If our families are even
more different than we are,

13:15.875 --> 13:17.297
the attraction
will be even stronger!

13:17.297 --> 13:18.418
That's science.

13:18.418 --> 13:20.089
Yeah!
Maybe you're right.

13:20.089 --> 13:21.260
Good news, boys.

13:21.260 --> 13:22.922
The Remingtons are dining
with us, tonight!

13:22.922 --> 13:24.844
-Yes!
-But, um,

13:24.844 --> 13:27.016
Maybe Cricket's gramma
needs to get dressed first.

13:27.016 --> 13:28.638
Ma! What are you doin'?!

13:28.638 --> 13:30.229
[Gramma] You ain't
gonna body shame me!

13:30.229 --> 13:31.731
Ooo, this is it, Remy.

13:31.731 --> 13:33.733
After tonight,
we'll be inseparable!

13:33.733 --> 13:35.485
We can finally start
that book club

13:35.485 --> 13:36.776
I'm always talking about!

13:36.776 --> 13:39.108
Maybe, Remy. Maybe.

13:39.108 --> 13:40.149
[helicopter whirling]

13:40.149 --> 13:40.990
It's your parents!

13:42.201 --> 13:43.573

13:43.573 --> 13:45.535
They have a helicopter?

13:49.909 --> 13:51.000
Geez O Petes...

13:51.000 --> 13:53.042
Touchdown! Think fast!

Aah! Sorry!

13:55.915 --> 13:56.916
The Greens!

13:56.916 --> 13:58.628
Thanks for inviting us
to dinner.

13:58.628 --> 14:01.010
Well, that was
quite the entrance.

14:01.010 --> 14:05.094
Russell and I are so excited to
finally meet the Green family.

14:05.094 --> 14:07.096
We've heard so much
from our Remy.

14:07.096 --> 14:08.598
Mom, look at
the cool goat!

14:08.598 --> 14:10.099
Ooh! How sweet.

14:10.099 --> 14:13.352
Wait a minute. Don't I
know you from the TV?

14:13.352 --> 14:15.395
You played for the
Big City Bengals!

14:15.395 --> 14:17.356
[laughs]
Yup! That's me!

14:17.356 --> 14:19.278
Always nice
to meet a fan.

14:19.278 --> 14:22.862
Well... I'm a fan of the
Rain County Roosters.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.444
A Roosters fan, huh?

14:24.444 --> 14:26.195
Somebody better
keep us apart!

14:26.195 --> 14:27.987
[laughing]
Here you go.

14:27.987 --> 14:29.989
You just wrote,
"I'm number one."

14:29.989 --> 14:31.290
Yup.

14:31.290 --> 14:33.202
I brought these flowers
for your wife.

14:33.202 --> 14:34.704
Will she be joining us?

14:34.704 --> 14:37.126
Uh, no. [chuckles]
Long story.

14:37.126 --> 14:39.128
But these are lovely!
Thank you.

14:39.128 --> 14:40.710
Uh, [stammering]
Oh, dear. The, um...

[struggling]
Don't... eat 'em!

14:45.094 --> 14:47.507
I think they're
becoming friends!

14:47.507 --> 14:49.969
Astute observation
as always, Remy.

14:49.969 --> 14:51.350
I think they're
getting along great.

-[goat cries]
-Still petty. [chuckles]

14:53.723 --> 14:57.106
[chuckles] Well, we're certainly
in for a fun evening.

14:57.106 --> 14:58.187
All right, everyone.

14:58.187 --> 14:59.609
Please gather
in the living room

14:59.609 --> 15:02.231
for the pre-dinner
entertainment.

15:02.231 --> 15:04.113
Howdy, folks! Please put
your hands together

15:04.113 --> 15:06.826

Tilly Green!

15:10.239 --> 15:11.991
Chickens, am I right?

15:11.991 --> 15:13.993
The way they're always going,

15:13.993 --> 15:16.415

15:22.712 --> 15:24.043
Oh! It's so true!

15:24.043 --> 15:25.885
I don't get it.

15:25.885 --> 15:27.046
Why don't you tell
one of your jokes?

15:27.046 --> 15:28.598
Oh! Great idea.

15:28.598 --> 15:30.470
[clears throat]
I've got a good one!

15:30.470 --> 15:33.683
I always appreciate
a fellow comedian!

15:33.683 --> 15:35.815
[clears throat]
So, I'm a lawyer,

15:35.815 --> 15:37.977
and I have a client
who's an orthodontist,

15:37.977 --> 15:39.438
but he wants
a new fee structure

15:39.438 --> 15:41.320
because I bill him
for too many hours.

15:41.320 --> 15:44.484
So, I said,
"Why don't we use
a prepaid arrangement?

15:44.484 --> 15:47.737
That way, both of us
can work on 'retainers'!"

15:47.737 --> 15:50.870
-[laughing]
-Boo!

15:50.870 --> 15:53.332
Oh! I guess I didn't
consider my audience.

15:53.332 --> 15:55.074
No, no. It was very funny.

15:55.074 --> 15:56.836
I'm just... laughing up here.

15:56.836 --> 15:59.669
Well, comedy's hard.
How 'bout some music?

15:59.669 --> 16:03.132
Introducing the classical
stylings of Remy Remington!

Cricket Green!
Professional pig player!

16:14.263 --> 16:15.264
[oink]

16:15.264 --> 16:16.686
This sounds awful.

16:16.686 --> 16:18.648
Don't worry! Remy'll
get better with practice.

16:18.648 --> 16:20.229
We weren't
talking about Remy.

16:20.229 --> 16:23.773
Oh. Well, pardon me,
but my son plays the pig
beautifully.

16:23.773 --> 16:25.364
Cricket!
They're arguing.

16:25.364 --> 16:26.906
Drown 'em out with music.

It's dinner time!
-Come on! Yay!

16:37.286 --> 16:39.458
-Come on, let's go eat dinner!
Yay! This'll be fun!
-Yay, dinner!

16:43.753 --> 16:47.046
[clears throat] Oh, uh, just
realized there's no napkins.

16:47.046 --> 16:48.127
I'll be right back.

16:48.127 --> 16:50.179
Alice, this meatloaf
is really...

16:50.179 --> 16:51.761
...well done.

16:51.761 --> 16:54.263
Thank you. You know,
I was just thinking

16:54.263 --> 16:56.305
about that game in '09
when you fumbled the ball

16:56.305 --> 16:58.227
and cost your team
the championship.

16:58.227 --> 17:02.141
-I'd say<i> that</i> was also
"well done."
-[growling]

17:02.141 --> 17:04.443
Hey, look what I found
when I was getting
the napkins!

17:04.443 --> 17:07.406
Rashida's beautiful flowers.

17:07.406 --> 17:10.029
Bill, the flowers are ruined.
Just throw them out.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.742
Well, I think they
make the table look nice.

17:12.742 --> 17:14.243
Cricket,
can I talk to you?

17:14.243 --> 17:15.955
Sure.
Step into my office.

17:15.955 --> 17:17.536
This is terrible!

17:17.536 --> 17:19.118
We had this dinner
to make our parents friends,

17:19.118 --> 17:21.040
but they're becoming enemies!

17:21.040 --> 17:23.162
And enemies don't let
their kids hang out together.

17:23.162 --> 17:25.004
Oh, my gosh.
You're right!

17:25.004 --> 17:26.505
Well, since we're
getting fancy,

17:26.505 --> 17:28.337
how 'bout a little
candle light?

17:28.337 --> 17:30.379
So<i> this</i> is
upscale dining.

17:30.379 --> 17:31.510
Very regal.

17:31.510 --> 17:33.132
Listen, Bill,

17:33.132 --> 17:35.224
you really don't have to go
through all this trouble.

17:35.224 --> 17:39.178
No, no. I know y'all
are used to nice things.

17:39.178 --> 17:42.231
Yes, well, tonight
we don't need it to be nice.

17:42.231 --> 17:45.605
Oh, really? Well, I'm just
tryin' to be hospitable.

17:45.605 --> 17:48.858
That's fine,
but it's not necessary.

17:48.858 --> 17:49.989
[Bill grunting]

17:49.989 --> 17:51.190
[all scream]

17:51.190 --> 17:52.782
Remy, we gotta
find a way to fix this

17:52.782 --> 17:55.865
before this whole night
goes down in flames!

17:55.865 --> 17:57.997
[Bill grunting]

17:59.789 --> 18:01.290
[grunts]

18:01.290 --> 18:02.291
Hmm!

18:02.291 --> 18:05.164
[gasps] Hmm.

18:05.164 --> 18:07.166
This is bad.
If we don't fix this,

18:07.166 --> 18:08.798
we might never
see each other again.

18:08.798 --> 18:10.419
I got one last idea, Remy.

18:10.419 --> 18:11.881
Hey!

18:11.881 --> 18:13.382
How 'bout we play a fun game?

18:13.382 --> 18:15.214
What kind of game?

18:15.214 --> 18:18.307
I bet Russell would love
a game of football!

18:18.307 --> 18:19.849
Oh, I'm in if you are!

18:19.849 --> 18:21.641
You've got yourself a game.

18:21.641 --> 18:23.482
I was thinking more
along the lines of...

18:23.482 --> 18:25.314
charades or something.

18:26.185 --> 18:27.937
Oh, look,
it's raining.

18:27.937 --> 18:29.228
We should probably
go back inside.

18:29.228 --> 18:31.861
-So, what are
the ground rules?
-[crack]

18:31.861 --> 18:33.442
There are no rules.

18:33.442 --> 18:35.865
No! No. How 'bout
touch football?

18:35.865 --> 18:39.328
-[Bill] Deal.
-And all the other rules
of football apply.

18:39.328 --> 18:41.330
Fine.

18:41.330 --> 18:42.331
[whistles]

18:42.331 --> 18:43.663
I can't wait to see

18:43.663 --> 18:46.205
what kind of moves
you think you got, Russel!

18:46.205 --> 18:48.127
Whatever they are,
they can't be as bad

18:48.127 --> 18:49.168
as your meatloaf!

18:50.589 --> 18:51.590
-Hike!
-Hike!

18:51.590 --> 18:52.591
[panting]

18:52.591 --> 18:55.424
[panting, grunts]

18:55.424 --> 18:56.636
You ain't catching me!

18:56.636 --> 18:57.637
-[Gramma grunts]
-[whistle]

18:57.637 --> 18:59.388
No one insults my cookin'!

18:59.388 --> 19:01.520
Hey! I thought we were
playing touch football!

19:01.520 --> 19:03.222
Technically,
she did touch you.

19:03.222 --> 19:04.644
Touched you
right to the ground.

19:04.644 --> 19:05.975
Ha!

19:05.975 --> 19:07.066
Hey! I got the ball!

19:07.066 --> 19:08.067
-Yah!
-[grunts]

19:08.067 --> 19:09.689
How's that for fancy?

19:09.689 --> 19:10.980
[moans]

19:10.980 --> 19:13.192
Ooo, this ain't good.

19:13.192 --> 19:14.403
[grunting]

19:14.403 --> 19:15.274
(slo-mo) [pained grunt]

19:15.274 --> 19:16.365
[whistles]

19:16.365 --> 19:19.328
[panting, grunts]

19:19.328 --> 19:20.489
[grunts, screams]

19:20.489 --> 19:21.911
-[grunts]
-Aah!

19:21.911 --> 19:22.952
[whistles]

19:22.952 --> 19:24.744
[panting, grimaces]

19:24.744 --> 19:26.285
[all screaming]

19:26.285 --> 19:27.626
-Aah! Remy!
-Cricket!

19:27.626 --> 19:28.627
[screaming]

19:28.627 --> 19:31.500
[whistling]

19:31.500 --> 19:33.292
[grunts] Cricket!

19:33.292 --> 19:34.293
You OK, bud?

19:34.293 --> 19:37.346
[gasps]
This is a nightmare.

19:37.346 --> 19:39.849
You gotta talk to your parents
and get them to stop.

19:39.849 --> 19:41.681
My parents?!
Your dad and gramma

19:41.681 --> 19:43.432
don't know how
to treat their guests!

19:43.432 --> 19:46.065
And it's like
you guys have no respect
for our hospitality!

19:46.065 --> 19:47.476
We're charming as heck!

19:47.476 --> 19:49.268
You know what? I was wrong!

19:49.268 --> 19:51.310
Opposites
don't attract.

19:53.312 --> 19:54.523
Everyone huddle up.

19:54.523 --> 19:56.365
This is our last chance
to win this thing.

19:56.365 --> 19:59.278
Let's show those
rich snobs what we can do.

19:59.278 --> 20:01.370
-Come on, team!
-Let's show them what it means

20:01.370 --> 20:02.371
to be a Remington!

20:02.371 --> 20:04.203
-[whistles]
-Play ball!

20:04.203 --> 20:05.745
[panting]
[grunts]

20:09.418 --> 20:10.419
[growls]

20:10.419 --> 20:11.500
[growls]

20:12.832 --> 20:13.883
Get 'em, Cricket!

20:13.883 --> 20:15.464
Show 'em what a Green can do!

20:15.464 --> 20:16.926
[screaming]

20:16.926 --> 20:18.337
-You can win this!
-Yah!

20:18.337 --> 20:20.259
[screaming]

20:20.259 --> 20:21.430
-Get 'em, Cricket! Get 'em boy!
-[shouting]

20:21.430 --> 20:23.262
-Yeah! Rip his face off, Son!
-[shouting]

20:23.262 --> 20:24.473
[screaming]

20:24.473 --> 20:25.434
[screaming]

20:25.434 --> 20:26.435
[both screaming]

20:31.310 --> 20:32.852
Why'd you stop
playing the game?

20:32.852 --> 20:34.563
What is going on?

20:34.563 --> 20:35.775
All evenin', we've been tryin'

20:35.775 --> 20:36.856
to make everyone get along.

20:36.856 --> 20:38.197
But it was a disaster!

20:38.197 --> 20:40.199
We don't wanna be on
separate teams.

20:40.199 --> 20:41.360
We're friends!

20:41.360 --> 20:42.491
Even if you guys aren't.

20:44.163 --> 20:47.286
I hate to say it,
but the boys are right.

20:47.286 --> 20:49.458
We haven't been very
hospitable tonight.

20:49.458 --> 20:52.752
You guys have so much,
and I was a bit intimidated.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.713
Intimidated by us?

20:54.713 --> 20:57.967
Remy is always talking about
how much he loves it
over here.

20:57.967 --> 21:00.469
I guess we were
a bit jealous.

21:00.469 --> 21:02.972
Well, even though we didn't
get along great tonight,

21:02.972 --> 21:04.383
at least our kids do.

21:04.383 --> 21:05.935
Hey, good game.

21:05.935 --> 21:07.346
Good dinner.

21:07.346 --> 21:10.349
[all] Good dinner.
Good dinner. Good dinner.

21:10.349 --> 21:11.811
Good dinner.

21:13.442 --> 21:15.604
Until next time,
Green Family!

21:16.776 --> 21:18.397
Well, it got
a little crazy there,

21:18.397 --> 21:20.609
but thank you for setting up
this dinner.

21:20.609 --> 21:23.612
It's always good
to get another perspective.

21:23.612 --> 21:25.825
Yeah, yeah. Check out
this perspective.

21:25.825 --> 21:27.366
