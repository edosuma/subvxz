[tense music]

00:14.875 --> 00:16.958
[helicopter whirring]

00:17.041 --> 00:18.541
[pilot 1] Command, this is Coyote Six.

00:18.625 --> 00:22.166
We're 70 miles northwest of the base.
Altitude, 1,500 feet.

00:22.250 --> 00:23.541
Requesting clearance for landing.

00:23.625 --> 00:26.833
[woman] Coyote Six, this is Command.
You're cleared to land on Runway Three.

00:26.916 --> 00:28.958
Wind, 50 at 14 knots,

00:29.041 --> 00:32.583
maximum two-niner-seven-four inches,
watch for chop.

00:32.666 --> 00:34.041
[loud bang]

00:34.125 --> 00:35.666
[pilot 2] Mayday! We're hit!

00:35.750 --> 00:36.958
-Losing altitude.
-Shit.

00:38.750 --> 00:41.958
[helicopter wheezing, squeaking]

00:42.041 --> 00:44.625
Command, this is Mad Dogs.
We have visual on Alpha Two,

00:44.708 --> 00:45.875
and it's going down.

00:45.958 --> 00:49.708
Coordinates 4-2 Sierra Whiskey
Alpha-niner-4-6-5-0-6-7-niner-2-niner.

00:49.791 --> 00:51.833
[man] Tell the other units to stand by.

00:51.916 --> 00:54.791
Team Three, Team Six,
this is Command. Stand by.

00:54.875 --> 00:55.875
Wait, what?

00:55.958 --> 00:58.083
[woman] I repeat,
Team Three and Team Six,

00:58.166 --> 01:01.000
-stand by and wait for orders.
-Take us down! We're gonna check it out.

01:02.791 --> 01:05.791
[tense music]

01:11.458 --> 01:14.291
[woman] Sir, the militia's
converging on the crash site.

01:16.791 --> 01:20.041
[man 1] Alpha Two's under attack.
They're totally surrounded.

01:20.125 --> 01:22.583
[indistinct chatter]

01:24.916 --> 01:27.666
[tense music continues]

01:27.750 --> 01:31.291
[pilot 3] Command, got eyes on Alpha Two.
Preparing to engage.

01:31.375 --> 01:34.166
[woman] Negative.
You are to stand by. Do not engage.

01:34.250 --> 01:37.083
-[man 1] They're firing on the enemy.
-[man 2] What unit is that?

01:38.083 --> 01:39.333
[woman] Mad Dogs, sir.

01:39.416 --> 01:42.875
Goddammit. Tell them to stand down
and get back in formation!

01:42.958 --> 01:44.958
Command to Mad Dogs. Stand down,

01:45.041 --> 01:46.708
-return to formation!
-When we hit the deck,

01:46.791 --> 01:49.958
we light 'em up with the SAWs,
then we go for survivors. Got it?

01:50.041 --> 01:51.083
[rapid exhaling in unison]

01:51.166 --> 01:54.125
[man 1] Command to Mad Dogs,
stand down and return to formation!

01:54.208 --> 01:57.000
-[helicopter whirring]
-[rope squeaks]

-[guns firing]
-[blood splatters]

02:15.833 --> 02:17.708
-[MD 1] Clear!
-[MD 2] Bastards took our guys!

02:17.791 --> 02:20.791
[eerie music]

02:26.125 --> 02:27.666
-[MD 3] Fuck.
-[MD 1] One here.

02:27.750 --> 02:29.666
[men grunting]

02:29.750 --> 02:31.625
[man] US Army Mad Dogs, can you move?

02:32.791 --> 02:34.333
[men grunting]

02:34.416 --> 02:35.666
Oh, shit.

02:35.750 --> 02:38.166
-[tires screech]
-[man grunting]

02:39.666 --> 02:41.208
Okay. He's still alive.

02:41.291 --> 02:43.541
-[loud explosion]
-[men groaning]

02:44.250 --> 02:46.375
[crowd yelling, cheering]

02:46.458 --> 02:49.458
[ominous music]

02:50.125 --> 02:52.000
[fire crackling]

02:55.041 --> 02:58.750
[soft thudding]

03:00.666 --> 03:03.375
[liquid pouring]

03:04.625 --> 03:06.750

03:09.250 --> 03:12.291
[men yelling]

03:13.666 --> 03:16.750

03:18.416 --> 03:21.125
[aggressive yells]

03:27.708 --> 03:30.750
[theme music plays]

04:32.958 --> 04:35.166
-[child coughing]
-[indistinct chatters]

04:35.750 --> 04:36.708
[woman] Hey.

04:37.458 --> 04:38.791
I'm Claire.

04:39.625 --> 04:40.750
Claire Redfield.

04:41.500 --> 04:42.750
What's your name?

04:46.666 --> 04:48.416
Remotsu…

04:49.291 --> 04:50.333
Ganape?

04:53.291 --> 04:56.625
Okay. Guess I'm gonna have
to learn the language a little better.

04:56.708 --> 04:58.916
[staff 1] No, Ms. Claire.
This child is mute.

04:59.500 --> 05:00.958
He cannot speak.

05:01.041 --> 05:02.083
What?

05:02.750 --> 05:04.791
He was in the civil war.

05:04.875 --> 05:06.541
He cannot speak.

05:06.625 --> 05:07.875
[distressed sigh]

05:07.958 --> 05:09.125
[Claire] Oh, man.

05:11.208 --> 05:13.208
The things you've probably seen.

05:15.250 --> 05:16.208
Well…

05:17.041 --> 05:18.416
if you're here…

05:19.833 --> 05:21.333
then you're safe.

05:22.708 --> 05:24.166
I'll make sure of it.

05:26.416 --> 05:28.083
[Claire] Do you like to draw?

05:28.750 --> 05:29.833
[grumbles]

05:29.916 --> 05:31.458
[Claire] Can I see?

05:35.833 --> 05:36.875
[light chuckle]

05:42.625 --> 05:43.541
[Claire groans]

05:44.166 --> 05:46.625
[haunting music]

05:57.041 --> 05:58.583
Oh, my God.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.416
Did you see this?

06:04.500 --> 06:06.083
[sighs]

06:08.083 --> 06:11.166
[haunting music continues]

06:13.666 --> 06:18.041
[operator] Delta, Charlie, 2-0-2-1-7,
this is the Ace of Spades.

06:18.125 --> 06:20.375
You're cleared to land on Runway 0-1.

06:20.458 --> 06:22.500
Wind, 30 at five knots.

06:24.416 --> 06:27.166
[heels clacking]

06:27.250 --> 06:28.291
[knocks on door]

06:28.375 --> 06:30.958
Thirty minutes should do.
The President's scheduled…

06:31.041 --> 06:32.666
[exhales]

06:32.750 --> 06:35.041
…an emergency call from a congressman.

06:35.125 --> 06:37.416
[man] I'm sure that can wait till later.

06:37.500 --> 06:38.833
You're the third agent?

06:38.916 --> 06:41.583
Where's the fourth?
There's supposed to be four of us.

06:41.666 --> 06:43.000
Leon should be on his way.

06:43.666 --> 06:45.250
[groans] Leon?

06:46.000 --> 06:49.041
Leon, as in the guy who saved
the President's daughter?

06:49.125 --> 06:50.125
Yep.

06:50.208 --> 06:53.041
That Leon. He's more than qualified.

06:53.125 --> 06:55.000
[man] Qualified? [scoffs]

06:55.083 --> 06:57.958
More like lucky.
The only reason he's the golden boy now

06:58.041 --> 07:00.750
is because he was
in the wrong place at the right time.

07:02.791 --> 07:05.958
He successfully handled
dozens of critical missions.

07:06.041 --> 07:08.875
In fact, he's on his way here
from that terror attack in Pittsburgh.

07:08.958 --> 07:10.875
-Like I said--
-In this line of work,

07:10.958 --> 07:12.875
luck doesn't solve problems.

07:12.958 --> 07:14.250
Skills do.

07:15.833 --> 07:16.875
[light claps]

07:16.958 --> 07:18.458
The President's ready. Come on.

07:20.083 --> 07:21.083
[man sighs]

07:25.416 --> 07:28.166
It's an honor to be working
with the hero of Penamstan.

07:28.958 --> 07:29.791
Hero?

07:32.875 --> 07:33.708
Yeah.

07:37.083 --> 07:41.833
[pilot 4] Copy. Runway 01.
Wind, 30 at five knots.

07:43.791 --> 07:46.166
Never gotten clearance
to land that fast before.

07:47.125 --> 07:48.416
You must be special.

07:54.291 --> 07:57.333
[helicopter whirring]

08:00.500 --> 08:02.583
[man] Unauthorized access?

08:02.666 --> 08:05.333
Right. Someone was trying
to get confidential files

08:05.416 --> 08:07.041
pertaining to the President.

08:08.791 --> 08:10.583
[guard] Presidential Aide Ryan
and three agents

08:10.666 --> 08:12.416
have just entered the Oval Office.

08:12.500 --> 08:14.791
Roger that. How's the West Wing look?

08:14.875 --> 08:15.875
All's well, sir.

08:17.208 --> 08:18.500
Thank you for waiting, gentlemen.

08:18.583 --> 08:21.583
One agent is still en route, but these
three are probably the most qualified--

08:21.666 --> 08:22.875
Please. Let's get this started.

08:22.958 --> 08:24.375
Defense Secretary Wilson?

08:24.458 --> 08:28.666
Yesterday, we received an alert
that one of our servers was compromised.

08:28.750 --> 08:31.291
It contains
the Pentagon's military secrets

08:31.375 --> 08:33.958
and other files that are
highly sensitive in nature.

08:34.666 --> 08:38.291
Normally, an authorization code
from the President is required to log on.

08:38.375 --> 08:40.291
But, somehow, they bypassed that step.

08:40.958 --> 08:44.083
Why is top-secret data
on a server with outside access?

08:44.708 --> 08:46.958
It can't be accessed externally.

08:48.250 --> 08:50.875
The server's on
a 100 percent local network.

08:51.583 --> 08:53.208
Then it was an inside job.

08:53.708 --> 08:57.041
We've looked through all
the surveillance footage from every angle.

08:57.125 --> 08:59.833
[sighs]
We haven't locked down any suspects yet.

09:00.375 --> 09:04.250
So until we do, everyone who entered
or left the White House in the 24 hours

09:04.333 --> 09:06.375
before or after the hack is a suspect.

09:06.458 --> 09:07.541
[heavy sigh]

09:07.625 --> 09:09.666
Guess that rules us three out.

09:09.750 --> 09:13.375
We'd like you to find and apprehend
the person who broke into the server.

09:14.458 --> 09:17.666
I suppose we should start by having
a look at the surveillance footage.

09:17.750 --> 09:20.708
That'll take days.
We should get someone else to do that.

09:20.791 --> 09:23.625
[Wilson] Actually, I have my suspicions.

09:23.708 --> 09:25.833
Oh, god, not this again.

09:25.916 --> 09:29.500
China has been waging a cyberwar
against this country for years now.

09:29.583 --> 09:33.250
Putting our government, our military,
and our citizens all at risk.

09:33.333 --> 09:36.541
-The internet is only the first stage.
-Secretary.

09:36.625 --> 09:39.666
Making blind assumptions
will only make things worse.

09:39.750 --> 09:43.625
We don't know it was them.
We don't know anything yet.

09:45.125 --> 09:47.750
Hundreds of people
come and go here every day.

09:47.833 --> 09:49.666
You and your family, Mr. President.

09:49.750 --> 09:51.875
The staff, dignitaries, tours.

09:51.958 --> 09:54.416
-Even the gardeners. It could be anybody--
-[power shuts down]

09:56.208 --> 09:57.625
[Ryan] What's going on?

09:57.708 --> 09:59.791
-[hard thump on door]
-[all gasping in surprise]

09:59.875 --> 10:01.750
-[agent 1] Quiet!
-[agent 2] Everyone down!

10:01.833 --> 10:04.166
[agent 1] Longhorn's secure.
Bring the Beast around.

10:04.250 --> 10:05.333
[radio clicks]

10:06.750 --> 10:08.625
-[beeping]
-[guard] What the hell?

10:08.708 --> 10:10.958
Why isn't the backup power coming on?

10:11.041 --> 10:13.625
Even if we go manual,
we can only get the emergency lights.

10:13.708 --> 10:15.166
-Check it now.
-Must've been a surge.

10:15.250 --> 10:17.791
-This is the chief. What's going on?
-East Wing's gone dark!

10:17.875 --> 10:19.166
-Does anyone copy?
-[beeping]

10:19.666 --> 10:21.791
[Ryan] Does anyone know
what's happening here?

10:22.916 --> 10:24.458
[Jason] This is no accident.

10:24.541 --> 10:26.333
I'm going to take a look outside.

10:26.416 --> 10:28.500
-Patrick, with me.
-[Patrick] Roger that.

10:28.583 --> 10:29.583
[flashlight clicks]

10:31.208 --> 10:34.166
[retreating footsteps]

10:34.250 --> 10:35.583
[Patrick] Everybody, stay calm!

10:35.666 --> 10:38.833
Get back to your offices,
lock the doors, and stand by.

10:38.916 --> 10:41.291
[uneasy music playing]

10:44.791 --> 10:46.958
[flashlight clicking]

10:50.166 --> 10:53.708
[man groaning in pain]

10:58.083 --> 10:59.791
-[man groans]
-[flashlight clicks]

11:01.791 --> 11:03.875
[Patrick] Press Secretary Spacer!
What happened?

11:03.958 --> 11:05.000
[Spacer] I don't know.

11:05.666 --> 11:07.041
It got dark and I…

11:07.125 --> 11:08.833
I got hit from behind.

11:08.916 --> 11:11.583
[Patrick] Did you see who it was?
Did they take anything?

11:13.083 --> 11:14.041
No.

11:16.208 --> 11:18.375
[Patrick]
I've got Press Secretary Spacer with me.

11:18.458 --> 11:19.333
He's injured.

11:19.416 --> 11:22.500
He's got a head wound, but he's conscious.
He says he was attacked.

11:22.583 --> 11:24.666
-[Jason] What's going on?
-[Patrick] Somebody hit him.

11:24.750 --> 11:26.500
I've got to take care of that wound.

11:27.208 --> 11:29.250
-Get to it. I'm checking upstairs.
-[Patrick] Right.

11:30.666 --> 11:31.916
[Spacer groaning]

11:32.000 --> 11:34.250
Mr. Spacer. Mr. Spacer, sir!

11:34.333 --> 11:35.291
What's wrong?

11:36.333 --> 11:39.875
[ominous music]

11:39.958 --> 11:42.041
Secretary Spacer's
going into cardiac arrest.

11:42.125 --> 11:43.625
[Patrick] I'm getting the AED.

11:44.250 --> 11:46.583
[thudding]

11:47.708 --> 11:48.708

-[Patrick grunts]

12:02.666 --> 12:03.833
[Spacer snarls]

12:03.916 --> 12:05.333
Stand down, or I'll shoot!

12:05.416 --> 12:08.458
[Spacer growling]

12:09.750 --> 12:11.916

-[blood splatters]

12:25.500 --> 12:27.916
[Patrick panting]

12:29.291 --> 12:30.125
Leon?

12:30.750 --> 12:33.166
Shoot them in the head. That stops them.

12:34.166 --> 12:35.166
Come on.

12:38.166 --> 12:39.458
[Jason] SWAT's en route.

12:39.541 --> 12:42.541
They can deal with the zombies up here
and getting the power back up.

12:42.625 --> 12:43.916
We'll head to the bunker.

12:44.583 --> 12:47.166
-[Graham] Are they really zombies?
-[Leon] Yes, sir.

12:47.250 --> 12:48.875
Sorry, I didn't get here sooner.

12:48.958 --> 12:52.750
Not at all. I'm indebted to you
for getting my daughter, Ashley, back.

12:52.833 --> 12:55.833
Besides, with you here,
we just might survive this.

12:57.625 --> 13:00.541
[Graham] I never thought what happened
at Raccoon City could happen here.

13:00.625 --> 13:01.583
[Jason] We all ready?

13:03.291 --> 13:06.041
[Jason] Let's get the President
to the bunker. Stay sharp out there.

13:16.125 --> 13:17.416

13:24.958 --> 13:26.708
[Leon] Why are they here?

13:26.791 --> 13:28.291
[digital beeping]

13:28.375 --> 13:29.666
[hums, clanks]

13:30.583 --> 13:34.833
Patrick, stay with the President.
Leon, Shen May, with me.

13:36.875 --> 13:38.666
[Jason] I'm counting
on those skills of yours.

13:41.333 --> 13:42.333
Hey.

13:43.125 --> 13:44.208
You good?

13:45.000 --> 13:46.708
Ye-- Yeah.

13:46.791 --> 13:49.208
I'm just a little freaked out.
I've never seen…

13:50.125 --> 13:51.875
zombies before.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.166
Thanks for back there.

13:56.083 --> 13:57.083
Okay.

14:01.333 --> 14:04.125
[Jason] Anything even
remotely hostile gets a headshot.

14:04.208 --> 14:07.458
[tense music]

14:07.541 --> 14:10.083
Whatever you do,
don't let them reach the bunker.

14:10.166 --> 14:11.541
Understood?

14:11.625 --> 14:12.708
[Shen May] Right.

14:12.791 --> 14:15.833

16:20.833 --> 16:22.500
[zipper rasps]

16:25.333 --> 16:26.833
[Leon] Think it's the T-Virus?

16:28.375 --> 16:30.625
We won't know till the lab checks it out.

16:31.166 --> 16:32.875
More important question is,

16:32.958 --> 16:35.541
how the hell did zombies
get in the White House?

16:36.333 --> 16:37.291
Hmm.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.083
And who's behind it?

16:43.916 --> 16:46.958
-[indistinct chatter]
-[Claire groans]

16:50.833 --> 16:55.416
Uh, Mr. Ryan, I work with TerraSave,
the NGO assisting the Penamstanis.

16:55.500 --> 16:56.625
Do you have a moment?

16:56.708 --> 16:57.708
What is it?

16:57.791 --> 17:01.500
I can't find Press Secretary Spacer.
Do you know where he might be?

17:01.583 --> 17:04.083
-Eh, he's on leave right now.
-"On leave"?

17:04.166 --> 17:06.375
-But I have an appointment with him.
-[sighs]

17:06.458 --> 17:09.666
I don't know what to tell you.
Perhaps you mixed up your dates.

17:09.750 --> 17:12.666
He's not here.
I'm sorry, I… I have another appointment.

17:14.041 --> 17:14.958
[scoffs]

17:16.541 --> 17:18.041
-[hums in wonder]
-[footsteps]

17:18.125 --> 17:19.875
Uh, Leon?

17:22.291 --> 17:23.125
Claire?

17:23.833 --> 17:25.333
[Leon] What're you doing here?

17:25.416 --> 17:28.458
I'm here with reps
from Penamstan's provisional government.

17:28.541 --> 17:31.750
Just trying to get some schools
and hospitals built.

17:31.833 --> 17:33.166
[Leon] Penamstan?

17:33.250 --> 17:36.291
Yeah.
The US wants a military presence there,

17:36.375 --> 17:40.250
so there's supposed to be some sort
of signing ceremony next week.

17:40.333 --> 17:44.666
Um, hey, actually,
could you take a look at something?

17:44.750 --> 17:47.166
Yeah, sure. What's this?

17:48.500 --> 17:49.916
A little boy drew them.

17:50.583 --> 17:53.208
They're what the civil war
looked like six years ago.

17:53.291 --> 17:55.416
[haunting music]

17:55.500 --> 17:58.000
[Claire] Doesn't that look
a lot like Raccoon City?

18:00.583 --> 18:03.833
I can't get anyone to go on record
about what happened there.

18:03.916 --> 18:08.166
But after seeing those, I mean,
it's gotta be another outbreak.

18:09.583 --> 18:13.083
-Hmm.
-Leon. Clock's ticking. Let's move.

18:14.875 --> 18:15.708
Wait.

18:16.416 --> 18:20.000
Isn't that the guy everyone calls
"the hero of Penamstan"?

18:20.083 --> 18:21.250
[Leon] In the flesh.

18:22.666 --> 18:24.500
Look, I gotta go.

18:25.625 --> 18:27.000
Don't do anything stupid.

18:27.666 --> 18:29.291
[Claire] Excuse me.

18:30.125 --> 18:31.125
Hey, Leon.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.541
That outfit doesn't suit you.

18:34.625 --> 18:36.208
[both chuckling]

18:42.166 --> 18:43.875
[Graham] It's the only way
to deal with this.

18:43.958 --> 18:47.666
[Wilson] Mr. President, the DIA
finished their analysis of the hacking.

18:47.750 --> 18:51.875
The files accessed
were classified documents regarding China.

18:51.958 --> 18:53.583
-China.
-[Wilson] Yes.

18:53.666 --> 18:56.708
They contained intel
on a bio-research facility in Shanghai

18:56.791 --> 18:58.541
we had flagged for surveillance.

18:59.416 --> 19:01.041
Bio-research facility?

19:01.625 --> 19:04.625
I suggest we send Jason
and his team to investigate.

19:04.708 --> 19:06.750
With your approval, of course.

19:06.833 --> 19:08.708
Now, wait just a minute.

19:08.791 --> 19:11.125
We don't want to provoke the Chinese.

19:11.708 --> 19:15.375
Besides, we can't send anyone in,
without talking to DHS, the CIA, and--

19:15.458 --> 19:16.416
[Wilson] Mr. President!

19:16.500 --> 19:19.541
First, there was the hacking,
then this outbreak in the White House!

19:19.625 --> 19:21.291
The White House, for God's sake!

19:21.375 --> 19:22.916
We are under attack!

19:27.708 --> 19:29.958
[helicopter whirring]

19:36.041 --> 19:38.875
[pensive music]

19:48.666 --> 19:49.500
Fine.

19:50.500 --> 19:51.416
Set it up.

19:52.791 --> 19:56.208
[Captain] She's a modified Virginia-class,
with an upgraded ASDS onboard.

19:56.291 --> 19:58.875
We're going to sneak right in
under the East Sea Fleet's nose,

19:58.958 --> 20:01.041
load your team onto the DS, and launch it.

20:01.125 --> 20:03.791
You'll make your rendezvous
without them even knowing it.

20:03.875 --> 20:07.875
Yes, sir, this little lady's outfitted
with stealth tech that's best-in-class.

20:07.958 --> 20:10.541
I've been itching for an op
like this to try it out.

20:10.625 --> 20:13.250
Remember, when we're running silent,
shut your holes.

20:13.333 --> 20:15.125
I don't want this turning
into some global…

20:15.208 --> 20:18.125
[heroic music playing]

20:18.208 --> 20:19.375
[Captain] Take us out.

20:19.458 --> 20:22.458
Make your depth one-five feet,
five-degree down bubble.

20:22.541 --> 20:25.291
One-five feet,
five-degree down bubble. Aye, sir.

20:31.083 --> 20:32.958
[Leon] Okay, where we at?

20:35.166 --> 20:36.375
All right.

20:36.458 --> 20:39.250
Our mission is to infiltrate
the bio-research facility

20:39.333 --> 20:41.166
and seize any evidence
pertaining to the hacking

20:41.250 --> 20:43.291
and the viral terrorist attack
at the White House.

20:43.375 --> 20:45.041
I'll brief you further
when we get to shore.

20:45.875 --> 20:49.750
We could just hack them.
What's the point of even going?

20:50.375 --> 20:53.458
Sorry, champ. That's classified for now.

20:55.958 --> 20:57.666
Details on the facility?

20:58.208 --> 20:59.875
For now, classified.

20:59.958 --> 21:01.541
[sighs] Time limit?

21:02.166 --> 21:04.541
-Classified.
-"Classified." Right.

21:07.125 --> 21:09.375
[Jason] Well, I'm going
to go check the gear.

21:10.708 --> 21:12.083
Get some shut-eye.

21:15.583 --> 21:17.416
-[door opens]
-Fantastic.

21:17.500 --> 21:18.875
[door closes]

21:18.958 --> 21:21.250
You wanna get dinner
when this is all over?

21:21.333 --> 21:25.208
Sure, but full disclosure,
I have a young man waiting for me.

21:25.958 --> 21:27.333
So…

21:27.416 --> 21:29.458
So, it's classified.

21:30.041 --> 21:33.291
[chuckles, exhales]

21:34.166 --> 21:35.166
For now.

21:36.875 --> 21:38.458
