WEBVTT

00:02.941 --> 00:04.541
Voilà.

00:04.609 --> 00:05.942
Meat à la Murray.

00:06.011 --> 00:07.210
Since my mom is now

00:07.279 --> 00:08.945
officially dating Vice Principal Murray,

00:09.014 --> 00:10.880
she thought it would be a great idea

00:10.949 --> 00:12.815
to invite him over for a
get-to-know-you dinner.

00:12.884 --> 00:15.985
I don't know exactly
what she's expecting.

00:16.053 --> 00:20.789
_

00:22.793 --> 00:23.825
Hey, no running, champ,

00:23.894 --> 00:25.561
and spit out that gum, princess.

00:25.629 --> 00:27.563
Detention for both you rascals.

00:27.631 --> 00:29.231
Aw, nuts!

00:32.537 --> 00:34.735
Oh. Thanks, poodle.

00:34.804 --> 00:36.504
Oh, did you want one, too?

00:37.707 --> 00:38.739
Hey there, twink.

00:38.808 --> 00:40.942
Tell me about all the
cute boys at school.

00:42.345 --> 00:44.845
I love ya, Vice Principal Daddy.

00:46.083 --> 00:48.940
Where are my tongs?
The long tongs? Whup...

00:48.941 --> 00:50.341
that's a tong-twister.

00:51.653 --> 00:53.053
I'll help you find them.

00:55.857 --> 00:57.124
Is Mom choking?

00:57.193 --> 00:58.992
I think that's the sound that
she makes when she laughs.

00:59.061 --> 01:00.294
Chilling.

01:00.362 --> 01:02.028
I don't like him wearing Dad's apron.

01:02.098 --> 01:03.997
Vice Principal Murray is
not the world's greatest dad.

01:04.066 --> 01:05.865
He's not ever the world's
greatest vice principal.

01:05.934 --> 01:07.800
I bet his ribs suck, too.

01:09.070 --> 01:10.169
Damn it.

01:10.238 --> 01:11.937
They're delicious.

01:12.006 --> 01:14.039
Okay, you guys, I need
us to be supportive.

01:14.109 --> 01:16.976
I someday want to bring a
boy home to meet the family,

01:17.044 --> 01:18.877
so I need to smooth the way with Mom.

01:18.946 --> 01:20.379
Not everything is about
you being gay, Kenny.

01:20.448 --> 01:21.814
I know.

01:21.882 --> 01:23.682
But it does seem to come up a lot.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.383
Yes, exactly, Shannon.

01:25.452 --> 01:26.951
I think we should all

01:27.020 --> 01:29.454
be supportive of family
members with new lovers

01:29.523 --> 01:31.856
regardless of occupation
and/or gender of said lovers.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.057
Oh, hey, Lionel Richie,

01:33.127 --> 01:34.993
stop saying "lovers"
at the dinner table.

01:35.061 --> 01:36.561
Yes, no one here is a lover.

01:36.630 --> 01:38.796
Are you enjoying that apron, VP Murray?

01:38.865 --> 01:40.965
Would you like me to also get
you a pair of my dad's underwear

01:41.034 --> 01:42.065
so you can wear those, too?

01:42.135 --> 01:43.167
Oh, no, thank you, Jimmy.

01:43.236 --> 01:45.802
I would like to propose a toast.

01:45.871 --> 01:49.173
To going from vice princi-pal
to vice princi-friend.

01:50.743 --> 01:51.509
- What the?
- Dad.

01:52.111 --> 01:53.177
- Pat?
- Dad?

01:54.280 --> 01:56.046
How did that get in my mouth?!

01:56.115 --> 01:58.981
Pat, I... I thought you were
going to the gym after your shift.

01:59.050 --> 02:01.050
Yeah, I was, but the
elevator was broken,

02:01.119 --> 02:02.051
so I took it as a sign.

02:02.120 --> 02:03.886
Hi, Pat.

02:03.955 --> 02:05.421
Oh, wow, look at that gun.

02:05.490 --> 02:07.089
It is... do... Is it loaded?

02:07.159 --> 02:08.691
Here, um, uh, take my seat.

02:08.759 --> 02:10.259
Or you could just sit on my lap.

02:10.328 --> 02:11.227
Why did I say that?

02:11.296 --> 02:12.662
Because I'm just so nervous.

02:13.898 --> 02:17.500
- Synced and corrected by chamallow -

02:19.670 --> 02:21.537
Clive ended up eating
dinner on the floor.

02:21.605 --> 02:23.104
I don't even want to know why,

02:23.174 --> 02:25.274
but he actually seemed
pretty comfortable down there.

02:25.342 --> 02:26.908
Anyway, it's time for us to do

02:26.977 --> 02:29.044
what regular people do
when they get divorced.

02:29.112 --> 02:30.445
Take classes at the learning annex

02:30.514 --> 02:31.846
about knitting through your anger.

02:31.915 --> 02:33.013
Of course not.

02:33.082 --> 02:34.448
You know how I feel
about adult education.

02:34.517 --> 02:38.252
No, I mean live in separate places.

02:38.321 --> 02:40.054
Pat's looking at apartments today.

02:40.122 --> 02:43.090
Oh, Eileen, that is not gonna be cheap.

02:43.159 --> 02:45.693
Well, we're just gonna have
to buckle down, you know?

02:45.761 --> 02:47.695
I'm making the kids have a yard sale.

02:47.763 --> 02:49.796
And I'm gonna have to get a job.

02:49.864 --> 02:51.030
I've been holding out
for something perfect,

02:51.099 --> 02:52.765
but I think I'm just gonna
have to bite the bullet

02:52.834 --> 02:54.067
and take something terrible.

02:54.135 --> 02:55.068
This is great.

02:55.136 --> 02:56.436
I have something terrible.

02:56.505 --> 02:58.638
We need a receptionist at the salon.

02:58.707 --> 03:02.141
I was imagining more of
an office thing, you know?

03:02.211 --> 03:03.710
I have this "Working Girl" fantasy.

03:03.778 --> 03:05.812
I've always wanted to
wear sneakers with a suit.

03:05.880 --> 03:07.145
You can wear whatever you want.

03:07.215 --> 03:09.715
I once wore pajamas, and
they weren't even mine.

03:09.783 --> 03:10.982
Knock, knock.

03:11.051 --> 03:12.218
Clive.

03:12.286 --> 03:14.086
How fun of you to pop by.

03:14.154 --> 03:15.987
Even though we've talked about you

03:16.056 --> 03:17.289
never, ever doing that.

03:17.358 --> 03:18.457
But, um

03:18.526 --> 03:19.991
I'm actually going to
the salon with Jodi.

03:20.060 --> 03:21.594
You are? Yay!

03:21.662 --> 03:23.761
- Work wives.
- Yeah.

03:23.830 --> 03:24.995
Anyway, thanks for the...

03:25.064 --> 03:26.397
Oh, these are for Pat.

03:26.466 --> 03:28.499
I'm here to apologize
to him for last night.

03:28.568 --> 03:30.935
So, you're bringing him chocolates.

03:31.003 --> 03:32.270
I know. It's a little weird.

03:32.339 --> 03:33.971
But the flower shop wasn't open yet.

03:37.176 --> 03:39.310
God help me, he turns me on.

03:41.593 --> 03:43.928
Hey, buddy.

03:44.896 --> 03:47.431
I, um, dry-cleaned your apron.

03:47.499 --> 03:49.899
- You didn't need to do that.
- I did.

03:50.468 --> 03:52.335
I couldn't sleep all night.

03:52.403 --> 03:54.603
Look, I know what it looked like,

03:54.672 --> 03:57.273
but I swear I'm not trying
to replace you. I mean,

03:57.342 --> 03:59.375
how could I? You're a cop,

03:59.694 --> 04:01.026
You got super-thick hair,

04:01.095 --> 04:02.528
and you're like some kind of a man lion.

04:02.597 --> 04:05.298
I've been told I have leonine
features before, Clive.

04:05.366 --> 04:06.632
Of course you have.

04:06.701 --> 04:09.502
Um, there's a mix CD in
the bag with the apron.

04:09.570 --> 04:10.903
Well, I'm kind of busy right now,

04:10.971 --> 04:11.671
so if you don't mind.

04:11.739 --> 04:13.706
Look, Pat, um...

04:13.775 --> 04:17.241
If you want me to go, I will.

04:17.310 --> 04:19.243
Just tell me what we had wasn't real.

04:19.313 --> 04:21.012
Well, that depends.

04:21.079 --> 04:24.416
Are those, uh, caramel sea salt?

04:24.484 --> 04:26.083
You know they are.

04:27.987 --> 04:29.253
Oh, damn you, Clive.

04:29.323 --> 04:30.888
I can't shut you out.

04:30.957 --> 04:32.323
It's like lopping off my own arm.

04:32.391 --> 04:34.191
Get over here, buddy.

04:34.259 --> 04:36.059
Oh, thank God.

04:36.128 --> 04:37.828
- Whoo-hoo.
- Hey.

04:37.896 --> 04:40.030
- Thanks for the hair compliment.
- Oh, no, of course.

04:40.098 --> 04:41.432
And I am sorry about last night.

04:41.500 --> 04:44.201
I would've had dinner with
Eileen and the kids at my place,

04:44.269 --> 04:46.102
but Mother won't let me have guests.

04:46.171 --> 04:47.571
Ah, that's okay. I get it.

04:47.640 --> 04:50.072
We've both been displaced by divorce.

04:50.141 --> 04:51.774
Things aren't that
great down here either.

04:51.843 --> 04:54.009
Ah, I understand.

04:54.078 --> 04:55.545
We both live in the basements

04:55.613 --> 04:57.380
- of strong, handsome women.
- Mm-hmm.

04:57.449 --> 04:59.281
But not for long.

04:59.351 --> 05:01.584
Want to go with me to look
at a new place today, buddy?

05:01.653 --> 05:04.119
Um, yeah.

05:04.188 --> 05:05.420
Yeah.

05:05.489 --> 05:07.222
- I'll be your apartment wingman.
- Yeah!

05:07.290 --> 05:10.191
- All right.
- Yeah. All right.

05:10.260 --> 05:12.527
Oh, that's great 'cause I
cannot wait to get out of here.

05:12.596 --> 05:15.230
I mean, those jock
straps aren't even mine.

05:15.298 --> 05:16.798
I was wondering.

05:18.301 --> 05:20.101
Oh, man, look at all this
stuff from when I was young.

05:20.170 --> 05:23.237
My Richard Simmons
VHS, my calligraphy set.

05:23.305 --> 05:25.806
Oh, my God, you guys, my Easy-Bake Oven.

05:27.042 --> 05:28.909
Honestly, why did I
even have to come out?

05:28.978 --> 05:31.211
Kenny, not everything
is about you being gay.

05:31.280 --> 05:32.646
Geez, not lately.

05:32.715 --> 05:34.281
We have to focus.

05:34.350 --> 05:35.449
There's gold in this garage.

05:35.518 --> 05:36.617
Some idiot hipster

05:36.686 --> 05:38.586
will want to use this
boombox as a purse.

05:38.654 --> 05:40.086
What is wrong with you two?

05:40.154 --> 05:42.121
Am I the only one who's
sad that Dad's moving out?

05:42.190 --> 05:43.322
Well, yeah, it sucks,

05:43.392 --> 05:44.524
but it's not really a surprise.

05:44.593 --> 05:46.158
We've known this is
coming for, like, a year.

05:46.227 --> 05:50.162
Yeah, but with him
leaving and Mom dating,

05:50.231 --> 05:52.131
it's gonna be a lot harder
for them to get back together.

05:52.200 --> 05:53.332
Interesting.

05:53.402 --> 05:55.668
- Shannon, a word.
- Please.

05:58.406 --> 06:00.739
How could he still think
that's a possibility?

06:00.808 --> 06:02.307
Clearly, he's in denial.

06:02.376 --> 06:03.409
We're gonna have to set him straight.

06:03.477 --> 06:04.576
Yeah, but we have to be gentle.

06:04.645 --> 06:06.244
He's not as emotionally
intelligent as we are.

06:08.382 --> 06:09.648
Damn it!

06:09.717 --> 06:11.016
Aah!

06:11.084 --> 06:12.451
This game is impossible.

06:12.520 --> 06:13.918
Yeah.

06:13.986 --> 06:15.085
Emotionally intelligent.

06:18.090 --> 06:19.791
Basically, you just need
to answer the phones,

06:19.859 --> 06:21.292
greet the customers, make appointments,

06:21.360 --> 06:23.160
- that sort of thing.
- Not a problem.

06:23.229 --> 06:25.797
Can't be any harder than
keeping Jimmy alive for 17 years.

06:25.865 --> 06:26.964
Okay, you knock 'em dead.

06:27.033 --> 06:28.299
I got to get back to my client

06:28.367 --> 06:29.600
and figure out how to make

06:29.669 --> 06:31.601
a party in the front
and business in the back.

06:34.740 --> 06:35.772
Oh.

06:35.841 --> 06:37.273
Hello. Covington's Curl...

06:37.342 --> 06:38.642
Mm. Hello?

06:38.710 --> 06:40.209
Um, hello?

06:40.278 --> 06:41.210
Hello?

06:41.279 --> 06:42.312
Oh.

06:44.282 --> 06:46.282
Covington's Curls. Please hold.

06:47.452 --> 06:50.352
- Thank you.
- I'm Steve, the colorist.

06:50.421 --> 06:52.488
And that's the first and last time ever

06:52.557 --> 06:53.622
that I do your job.

06:53.691 --> 06:55.190
I am not Steve the receptionist.

06:55.259 --> 06:58.828
He was fired for stealing petty cash.

07:00.631 --> 07:02.130
Hello.

07:02.199 --> 07:03.666
Let me guess... you're
here for an eyebrow wax.

07:03.734 --> 07:05.399
I came to pick up some shampoo.

07:05.469 --> 07:06.434
For your eyebrows?

07:07.771 --> 07:10.271
Uh, that was a... that was a joke.

07:12.108 --> 07:15.176
Uh, why don't you just
take this shampoo and go.

07:22.250 --> 07:24.852
Hey, big guy.

07:24.920 --> 07:25.986
You maybe want to talk about

07:26.054 --> 07:27.320
how in the world you thought Mom and Dad

07:27.389 --> 07:28.489
would ever get back together?

07:28.557 --> 07:29.422
It's simple.

07:29.492 --> 07:30.491
Dad lives in the basement.

07:30.559 --> 07:31.925
And eventually, basements flood,

07:31.994 --> 07:34.327
and when it does, Mom will
go down to check on Dad.

07:34.396 --> 07:35.228
she'll slip and go under.

07:35.297 --> 07:36.497
Dad'll dive in to save her.

07:36.565 --> 07:38.331
He'll carry her upstairs and boom...

07:38.400 --> 07:39.765
they rekindle their love for each other.

07:39.834 --> 07:41.367
That was specific.

07:41.435 --> 07:42.401
And ridiculous.

07:42.470 --> 07:44.236
Mom is entering the workforce.

07:44.305 --> 07:46.271
She'll discover a buried
talent for business,

07:46.340 --> 07:49.274
cash out, and move to Tuscany
as a freelance expat blogger.

07:49.343 --> 07:51.777
Sure, sometimes when she's
standing on the villa terrace,

07:51.846 --> 07:53.546
her mind will fleetingly turn to Dad.

07:53.615 --> 07:54.847
But she knows he's content

07:54.916 --> 07:56.681
with his life on the ranch in Montana.

07:56.750 --> 07:58.016
Oh, man.

07:58.084 --> 07:59.283
I think you might be right

07:59.352 --> 08:01.119
about them not getting back together.

08:01.187 --> 08:03.421
Look at this.

08:03.490 --> 08:04.455
Yeesh.

08:04.525 --> 08:06.892
That's the one they framed?

08:06.960 --> 08:08.860
They look as scared as
Kenny does at the lake.

08:08.929 --> 08:10.028
'Cause it's cold and dirty,

08:10.096 --> 08:11.462
and I can feel the fish on my feet.

08:11.532 --> 08:13.397
I knew Mom and Dad got
married because of me,

08:13.465 --> 08:15.432
but I always thought that
they would've done it anyways

08:15.501 --> 08:16.600
'cause they loved each other.

08:16.669 --> 08:18.301
Look at them... they were never happy.

08:18.370 --> 08:21.204
If it wasn't for me, Mom
could have been an astronaut.

08:21.273 --> 08:23.741
And Dad could have been married
to a different astronaut.

08:23.809 --> 08:25.275
Why don't you just ask Mom and Dad

08:25.344 --> 08:27.310
if they would've gotten married anyway?

08:27.379 --> 08:29.312
Because they'll just tell me
what they think I want to hear.

08:29.381 --> 08:30.413
Mm.

08:30.481 --> 08:31.848
Like when they told us that our turtle

08:31.917 --> 08:33.416
went to live with its
family in the woods.

08:33.484 --> 08:34.551
Exactly.

08:34.619 --> 08:36.485
- Except this will be a lie.
- Right.

08:36.554 --> 08:38.421
Well, you know, Father
Bernard is now at St. Leopold.

08:38.489 --> 08:39.556
We could go ask him.

08:39.624 --> 08:41.090
That's a great idea.

08:41.159 --> 08:43.392
Plus, St. Leopold is where
Dad says my hamster lives.

08:44.395 --> 08:46.895
I just don't trust him by himself.

08:49.667 --> 08:51.299
Lunch.

08:51.368 --> 08:55.103
Thank God. I'm famished.

08:55.172 --> 08:56.772
Oh, Eileen, you're amazing.

08:56.840 --> 08:57.940
It took the old receptionist

08:58.008 --> 08:59.474
three times as long
to get the orders in.

08:59.543 --> 09:01.977
Of course she also had a
neck tattoo and chewed foil.

09:02.046 --> 09:04.511
ll, I'll let you in my secret.

09:04.581 --> 09:07.181
I always ignore special requests.

09:07.249 --> 09:08.950
If I indulge all of my kids' pickiness,

09:09.018 --> 09:10.451
I'd never get anything done.

09:10.519 --> 09:12.620
Besides gluten allergy is not a thing.

09:14.423 --> 09:15.422
Gluten.

09:15.491 --> 09:17.592
Nice try, drama queen.

09:17.660 --> 09:19.359
I got one of you at home.

09:20.762 --> 09:24.530
Oh, no. He's really swelling up.

09:27.915 --> 09:29.649
This place has got to be
better than the last one.

09:29.718 --> 09:31.751
Who puts carpet in the bathroom?

09:31.819 --> 09:34.420
That place was haunted.
I felt a presence.

09:34.489 --> 09:36.288
Mother always said I had a gift.

09:36.357 --> 09:38.089
Excuse me.

09:38.158 --> 09:38.923
Hi.

09:38.992 --> 09:40.225
How you doing? I'm Pat.

09:40.294 --> 09:41.660
Called earlier about the
furnished two-bedroom.

09:41.729 --> 09:43.629
I'm Marco. Welcome to the Hazelwood.

09:43.697 --> 09:45.397
First off, I want you fellas to know

09:45.466 --> 09:46.798
that here at the 'Wood,

09:46.867 --> 09:48.833
we are very inclusive of
alternative relationships.

09:49.637 --> 09:51.403
Oh, no.

09:51.472 --> 09:52.436
This is just for me.

09:52.505 --> 09:53.904
Oh, yeah, we're not a couple.

09:53.973 --> 09:55.506
- I'm just dating his wife.
- Yeah.

09:55.575 --> 09:57.275
The devil's threesome.

09:57.343 --> 09:58.942
I love it.

09:59.011 --> 10:01.178
Most of the guys here are
divorced, too, like myself.

10:01.247 --> 10:02.580
I'm not just the building manager.

10:02.649 --> 10:04.114
- I'm also a tenant.
- Oh.

10:04.183 --> 10:05.149
Hey, Sam.

10:05.217 --> 10:06.150
Hey, guys.

10:06.218 --> 10:07.485
Divorce beers by the pool.

10:07.553 --> 10:09.286
What makes them divorce beers?

10:09.354 --> 10:10.820
'Cause we can drink
them whenever we want.

10:10.889 --> 10:12.289
- Ah!
- Yeah!

10:12.357 --> 10:14.624
Come on, guys. Let's check it out.

10:14.693 --> 10:19.095
Pat, this place comes
with furniture and friends.

10:19.164 --> 10:20.630
I could use a beer.

10:23.268 --> 10:25.268
So, were you trying to murder me?

10:25.337 --> 10:27.503
Or are you just grossly incompetent?

10:27.571 --> 10:28.837
If I wanted you dead,

10:28.906 --> 10:30.606
I would've been a lot slower
with the EpiPen, Steve.

10:30.675 --> 10:33.108
Okay.

10:33.177 --> 10:34.543
Well, I just got to the salon,

10:34.612 --> 10:35.678
so I'll call you back later.

10:35.746 --> 10:36.945
- Oh.
- Okay, bye-bye.

10:37.014 --> 10:39.281
Oh, oh, Jodi.

10:40.618 --> 10:42.884
Um, thank you so much for your services.

10:42.953 --> 10:45.653
I... I'll be paying now
and going to my home.

10:45.722 --> 10:47.322
Eileen, no, you have to help Nancy.

10:47.390 --> 10:49.524
You're already on thin ice
with Steve, the colorist.

10:49.592 --> 10:51.526
I can hear you.

10:51.594 --> 10:56.197
And since I'm incapacitated,
you have to wash her hair.

10:59.202 --> 11:00.500
Eileen.

11:01.403 --> 11:02.436
Hello, Nancy.

11:02.504 --> 11:05.205
I haven't seen you since the book club.

11:05.273 --> 11:06.807
Oh, my gosh, do you work here?

11:06.875 --> 11:08.508
I had no idea.

11:08.577 --> 11:10.877
I feel so weird about you serving me.

11:10.946 --> 11:13.913
Well, there's no reason
to feel weird, Nancy.

11:13.982 --> 11:15.816
It's... it's my job.

11:15.884 --> 11:17.583
And she's terrible at it.

11:17.652 --> 11:19.652
Oh.

11:19.721 --> 11:21.654
Steve.

11:21.723 --> 11:23.155
Girlfriend.

11:23.224 --> 11:24.089
Stop it.

11:24.158 --> 11:25.758
Yeah.

11:25.827 --> 11:29.495
So, uh, we were wondering

11:29.564 --> 11:30.696
if maybe you remember

11:30.765 --> 11:32.531
what our parents' wedding day was like.

11:32.600 --> 11:33.699
Were they happy?

11:33.768 --> 11:36.701
Oh, I remember like it was yesterday.

11:36.770 --> 11:40.372
Your parents were so in love,
they were practically glowing.

11:40.440 --> 11:42.607
Oh! Pat and Eileen.

11:42.676 --> 11:45.610
Yeah, I was thinking of Matt and Irene.

11:45.679 --> 11:47.979
Well, what do you remember
about our parents' wedding?

11:48.047 --> 11:49.447
Oh, my, uh, uh,

11:49.516 --> 11:52.249
who... who can remember such things?

11:52.317 --> 11:53.584
I'm an old man.

11:53.652 --> 11:55.952
Father, let's not
waste each other's time.

11:56.021 --> 11:57.788
All right.

11:57.857 --> 12:00.391
You're obviously not children anymore,

12:00.459 --> 12:01.892
so I'll be honest.

12:01.960 --> 12:05.262
It was a dark day... dark.

12:05.330 --> 12:08.598
I've never seen two young
people so not in love.

12:08.666 --> 12:10.633
I knew it. I ruined their lives.

12:10.702 --> 12:13.068
I'm a homewrecker. No, wrong
use of that term, Jimmy.

12:13.137 --> 12:16.105
But look, Father, I'm
sure maybe it started out

12:16.173 --> 12:17.673
as a shotgun situation.

12:17.742 --> 12:19.108
But they had two other kids,

12:19.176 --> 12:21.110
- so something must have gone right.
- Ah, yes.

12:21.178 --> 12:22.445
After Jimmy was born,

12:22.514 --> 12:24.847
Pat and Eileen came to me for counseling

12:24.916 --> 12:27.315
because they were
unhappy in their marriage.

12:27.384 --> 12:31.453
So I told them to have another child

12:31.522 --> 12:33.154
because children bring joy.

12:33.223 --> 12:34.856
And that was you, Kenny.

12:34.925 --> 12:36.858
So I'm a Band-Aid baby?

12:36.927 --> 12:38.693
Not a very effective one.

12:39.696 --> 12:41.863
Yeah, I'm just joshing you, son.

12:41.932 --> 12:42.996
But no, you didn't help.

12:43.065 --> 12:45.466
So they came back to me again,

12:45.535 --> 12:47.802
and I told them the same thing.

12:47.870 --> 12:51.305
And nine months later,
little Shannon was born.

12:51.373 --> 12:54.374
And like I told them, the
third time was the charm.

12:54.444 --> 12:55.810
Well, actually they're
getting a divorce.

12:55.878 --> 12:57.812
Well, I tried.

12:57.880 --> 12:59.879
So Mom and Dad were never really happy.

12:59.948 --> 13:01.781
And having us just
prolonged their misery.

13:01.850 --> 13:04.884
Ha. We were all mistakes.

13:04.953 --> 13:05.718
Burn!

13:05.787 --> 13:06.786
Wait.

13:06.855 --> 13:10.122
Now, now, God doesn't make mistakes.

13:10.191 --> 13:11.458
Sure.

13:11.526 --> 13:13.225
Except homosexuality, right?

13:13.294 --> 13:15.829
Not everything's about
you being gay, son.

13:15.897 --> 13:18.797
I know... I keep trying to,
like, wedge it in there, but...

13:20.768 --> 13:23.068
Uh, it's a little chilly for a luau, no?

13:23.136 --> 13:24.736
Ah, it's always summer somewhere.

13:24.805 --> 13:25.871
- Well, that is true.
- Yeah.

13:25.940 --> 13:27.205
- Like, below the equator, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

13:27.274 --> 13:29.240
The changes in latitude
is changes in attitude.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.376
I like this guy.

13:31.445 --> 13:33.378
- You are fun.
- Oh, thanks, man.

13:33.447 --> 13:35.813
Would you like a passion
fruit margarita, Clive?

13:35.882 --> 13:37.849
Mm, I would not like one, Graham.

13:38.918 --> 13:39.851
I would love one.

13:41.420 --> 13:42.487
But, uh, I do think my kids

13:42.555 --> 13:43.654
are gonna love that pool next summer.

13:43.723 --> 13:45.923
Man, I haven't seen my kids in weeks.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.157
Oh, yeah, it's been a while

13:47.226 --> 13:48.425
since I've seen little Marco.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.094
But you know, everybody gets busy.

13:50.162 --> 13:51.394
And time flies here, man.

13:51.463 --> 13:53.062
I mean, I moved in as a temporary thing,

13:53.131 --> 13:54.163
and that was three years ago.

13:54.232 --> 13:55.198
Tell me about it.

13:55.266 --> 13:56.867
I blinked. I was hear eight years.

13:56.935 --> 13:58.001
Eight years?

13:58.069 --> 13:59.435
Carl's been here more than a decade.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.571
Just till I save enough
to buy that mobile home.

14:01.640 --> 14:03.339
Damn double alimony.

14:04.442 --> 14:05.842
But we're living the life, man.

14:05.911 --> 14:07.776
I haven't even told you
about our holiday spreads yet.

14:07.845 --> 14:10.245
We do a decent turkey
dinner on Thanksgiving.

14:10.314 --> 14:12.848
Serve it up in the gym.
It's all family style.

14:12.917 --> 14:15.017
Well, I won't need the
family-style Thanksgiving.

14:15.085 --> 14:17.553
I, uh, plan on celebrating
with my actual family.

14:21.859 --> 14:24.192
Whoa, Nelly! Those shirts are da bomb.

14:24.261 --> 14:25.292
Looks like you're wearing a jungle.

14:26.362 --> 14:27.695
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ah, ah.

14:29.032 --> 14:30.297
I just think you are so brave,

14:30.366 --> 14:31.900
what you're doing.

14:31.968 --> 14:33.801
I can't imagine being single again.

14:33.870 --> 14:36.037
Starting a whole new life and career.

14:36.105 --> 14:37.772
And at your age?

14:37.841 --> 14:40.775
Well, I can't imagine
having such a lumpy skull.

14:40.844 --> 14:42.543
You better hope you don't get alopecia

14:42.611 --> 14:44.477
'cause you would look really weird bald.

14:44.547 --> 14:45.779
I only came in today

14:45.848 --> 14:47.581
because Dan and I are
going out to dinner tonight

14:47.650 --> 14:49.249
for our 10-year annivers...

14:49.317 --> 14:51.251
Oops. I'm so sorry.

14:51.319 --> 14:52.986
I... I'm sure that you
don't want to hear about

14:53.055 --> 14:54.487
other people's happy marriages.

14:54.557 --> 14:55.956
- All done.
- Ow.

14:56.025 --> 14:57.090
Happy anniversary.

14:58.626 --> 14:59.491
Hello.

15:02.063 --> 15:03.462
Eileen, thank God.

15:03.531 --> 15:05.464
You have to come and get me
from the Hazelwood. I'm in hell.

15:05.533 --> 15:07.433
Ditto. I'll be there in 20.

15:07.501 --> 15:09.401
It burns.

15:10.905 --> 15:12.905
Well, thanks again for coming to get me.

15:12.974 --> 15:14.106
I tell you.

15:14.175 --> 15:15.974
It was starting to get a
little crazy over there.

15:16.043 --> 15:17.976
Clive was drunk texting his mother.

15:18.045 --> 15:20.244
Mm, I don't think his sinewy body

15:20.313 --> 15:23.648
- knows how to properly metabolize alcohol.
- No.

15:23.717 --> 15:26.084
Anyway, I'm just glad
to get out of that salon.

15:26.152 --> 15:28.286
- Oh, I see.
- So we both had crappy days?

15:28.354 --> 15:29.520
Yeah.

15:29.590 --> 15:31.856
Let's just stay in and have
a quiet night with the kids.

15:31.925 --> 15:33.356
Yes, please.

15:33.425 --> 15:35.926
Love is a lie.
Everything must go!

15:38.598 --> 15:40.030
Our pain is your gain.

15:40.099 --> 15:41.198
What's your fancy?

15:41.266 --> 15:43.033
I've got newborn footprints in clay,

15:43.102 --> 15:45.469
a first-place trophy from
St. Barklay's family fun run,

15:45.537 --> 15:47.437
and a very nice jar of baby teeth.

15:47.506 --> 15:49.206
You have excellent taste.

15:49.274 --> 15:50.272
Get out of here.

15:51.509 --> 15:53.009
Thanks a lot, Mom. I
had him on the hook.

15:57.514 --> 15:58.714
This 18-year-old photograph

15:58.782 --> 16:00.682
is the reason why you're purging

16:00.751 --> 16:02.650
all of our cherished family memories?

16:02.719 --> 16:03.817
It's not just the photo.

16:03.886 --> 16:05.720
We know you guys were
never happy together.

16:05.788 --> 16:08.122
And then having us ruined your lives.

16:08.190 --> 16:09.523
Wait, hang on a second.

16:09.592 --> 16:10.691
That is not true, okay?

16:10.760 --> 16:12.627
You guys didn't ruin our lives.

16:12.695 --> 16:13.794
You're the best part of them.

16:13.863 --> 16:15.028
Really?

16:15.097 --> 16:16.196
Because Father Bernard
said you only had us

16:16.266 --> 16:17.732
to try to save your doomed marriage.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.332
Oh, please, what does he know?

16:19.401 --> 16:21.635
We saw that priest like 3 times in 18 years...

16:21.703 --> 16:23.970
and he always called us Matt and Irene.

16:24.038 --> 16:26.373
Look, just because
our marriage has ended,

16:26.441 --> 16:28.908
doesn't mean that we
regret that it happened.

16:28.977 --> 16:31.578
If we could do it all
over again, we would.

16:31.647 --> 16:33.179
- That's right.
- In heartbeat.

16:33.398 --> 16:34.464
Really?

16:34.533 --> 16:35.632
Yes.

16:38.569 --> 16:39.501
Swear on this.

16:40.805 --> 16:42.538
I swear on...

16:42.606 --> 16:45.373
"Chicken Soup for the
Scrapbooker's Soul."

16:45.443 --> 16:48.009
You three kids are the best
thing that ever happened to us.

16:49.780 --> 16:51.379
Yes, samesies.

16:51.449 --> 16:53.981
You kids, Mike Ditka,
pineapple on a pizza.

16:54.050 --> 16:57.017
And no matter what, we're
always gonna be a family.

16:57.086 --> 17:00.755
- Nothing will ever change that.
- That's right.

17:00.824 --> 17:02.189
It's so funny.

17:02.258 --> 17:04.058
We're happier at the end of our marriage

17:04.126 --> 17:05.726
than we were at the very beginning.

17:05.795 --> 17:07.829
Yeah.

17:07.896 --> 17:09.864
It's too bad there's not a ceremony

17:09.933 --> 17:11.998
where we get all dressed
up and celebrate that.

17:12.067 --> 17:13.165
Yeah.

17:13.233 --> 17:14.267
That would be weird.

17:14.336 --> 17:17.403
Hm.

17:19.000 --> 17:25.074

17:36.591 --> 17:38.123
You know, not a lot of women can say

17:38.192 --> 17:39.358
they're 30 pounds lighter

17:39.426 --> 17:40.960
than they were on their wedding day.

17:50.269 --> 17:51.903
Thank you.

17:51.972 --> 17:53.705
- Very good, son.
- Thank you.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.907
We are gathered here today

17:55.976 --> 17:59.644
to celebrate the divorce
of Eileen and Pat O'Neal.

17:59.793 --> 18:01.425
Who gives this woman away?

18:03.128 --> 18:05.028
I do.

18:05.097 --> 18:06.663
And I give this man away.

18:06.732 --> 18:07.898
All right, Mom and Dad,

18:07.967 --> 18:09.800
is there anything you'd
like to say to each other?

18:12.437 --> 18:15.171
Pat, there are so many great things

18:15.240 --> 18:17.173
that have come out of our marriage.

18:17.242 --> 18:18.541
But we've known for a long time

18:18.610 --> 18:19.909
that we just didn't work as a couple.

18:19.978 --> 18:21.644
- And that's okay.
- That's right.

18:21.713 --> 18:23.579
- Yeah. We got together way too fast.
- Yeah.

18:23.648 --> 18:25.147
The only thing we really had in common

18:25.216 --> 18:26.181
was a love of Foreigner.

18:26.250 --> 18:27.316
Yeah, God, how great is Foreigner?

18:27.384 --> 18:29.085
They're so great.

18:29.153 --> 18:30.152
Well, from this day forward,

18:30.221 --> 18:31.386
I promise never again

18:31.455 --> 18:33.388
to bother you with my wet towels...

18:33.457 --> 18:35.390
... or sleep apnea.

18:35.459 --> 18:38.559
And I promise that you'll
never have to see my bite guard

18:38.629 --> 18:39.894
left out on the nightstand

18:39.963 --> 18:41.195
or wash the dishes

18:41.264 --> 18:43.231
before putting them in
the dishwasher ever again.

18:43.299 --> 18:46.901
And I vow to see you kids all the time.

18:46.970 --> 18:48.269
Like a lot.

18:48.338 --> 18:51.072
Seriously, you're gonna
get really sick of me.

18:51.141 --> 18:53.373
And I vow to continue
making family meals,

18:53.442 --> 18:55.208
possibly taking into consideration

18:55.277 --> 18:56.877
your special food requests.

18:56.946 --> 18:59.613
Apparently gluten
allergy is a real thing.

19:00.916 --> 19:04.184
Well, if anyone objects to this divorce,

19:04.253 --> 19:06.553
please speak now or
forever hold your piece.

19:06.622 --> 19:08.421
- I'm good.
- Me too.

19:09.458 --> 19:11.958
These are tears of joy.

19:12.027 --> 19:13.126
I used to be in there.

19:13.194 --> 19:14.961
- Oh.
- Oh.

19:15.030 --> 19:17.030
Okay.

19:17.098 --> 19:19.431
- Well, can we all join hands?
- Yeah.

19:19.500 --> 19:21.567
Okay.

19:21.636 --> 19:26.705
Do we O'Neals take each
other for better, for worse,

19:26.774 --> 19:28.306
in sickness, and in health,

19:28.375 --> 19:29.775
regardless of new lovers

19:29.843 --> 19:31.810
or different geographical locations

19:31.879 --> 19:33.611
for the rest of our lives?

19:33.681 --> 19:34.946
We do.

19:35.015 --> 19:37.282
Well, then, by the power vested in me

19:37.350 --> 19:39.785
by the Little Saviors Winter Bible Camp,

19:39.853 --> 19:43.454
I now pronounce us a committed family.

19:43.523 --> 19:44.822
We may now take a family selfie.

19:44.891 --> 19:45.756
Hey.

19:46.693 --> 19:47.925
Here, I got the long arms.

19:47.994 --> 19:48.926
- Selfie cam.
- Okay.

19:49.962 --> 19:52.129
- All right.
- Everybody lean in.

19:52.198 --> 19:53.097
- Get in there.
- Here we go.

19:53.166 --> 19:54.331
A smiling or silly face?

19:54.400 --> 19:55.499
Here we go, smiling.
Yeah, Smiling. Smiling.

19:55.568 --> 19:57.134
Ready, one, two, three.

19:57.203 --> 19:58.635
I have to say,

19:58.705 --> 20:00.470
of all the pictures this
family has ever taken,

20:00.539 --> 20:03.073
this one is the best.

20:06.717 --> 20:08.115
Mm. Boy, getting Kenny
that Easy-Bake Oven

20:08.184 --> 20:10.284
is definitely the best decision
we ever made as parents.

20:10.354 --> 20:11.952
Yep, it's true.

20:12.020 --> 20:14.722
- He's still got it.
- Yeah.

20:17.292 --> 20:18.625
Boy, starting that new job

20:18.694 --> 20:20.461
was a lot harder than I expected.

20:20.529 --> 20:22.062
- Oh, yeah?
- It was really humbling.

20:22.130 --> 20:24.064
I was terrible at everything.

20:24.132 --> 20:26.700
- That doesn't sound like you.
- I know.

20:26.769 --> 20:28.968
I'm never humble because I'm
always excellent at everything.

20:31.272 --> 20:33.305
Ha ha. Look at that.

20:33.375 --> 20:36.108
Clive signed a two-year
lease at the Hazelwood.

20:36.177 --> 20:38.444
He loved it there.

20:38.513 --> 20:40.380
It's just not for me, though.

20:40.448 --> 20:42.815
I don't want to eat
turkey on a elliptical.

20:42.884 --> 20:44.316
- You know what?
- Hmm?

20:44.386 --> 20:46.718
This garage is actually pretty big

20:46.787 --> 20:49.220
- without all that crap in it.
- Mm-hmm.

20:49.289 --> 20:51.222
Why don't we fix it up?

20:51.291 --> 20:52.424
And you can move in here.

20:52.493 --> 20:54.259
We'd each have our own separate spaces.

20:54.327 --> 20:56.160
I like it.

20:56.229 --> 20:57.929
Plus, if we don't need the
money for another apartment,

20:57.998 --> 20:59.297
you can quit the job at the salon.

20:59.366 --> 21:00.331
Oh, I'm not quitting.

21:00.401 --> 21:01.767
I never quit anything in my life.

21:01.835 --> 21:03.000
I'm not about to start now.

21:03.068 --> 21:04.301
No, it's just new, is all.

21:04.370 --> 21:07.271
- I'm a quick study.
- Oh, yes, this is true.

21:07.339 --> 21:08.372
That's why you were

21:08.441 --> 21:10.140
banned from casino night at the church.

21:10.209 --> 21:13.176
Counting cards is not cheating.

21:13.245 --> 21:15.112
Father Phil is a crybaby.

21:15.180 --> 21:16.447
I'd say it to his face.

21:16.516 --> 21:18.348
Oh, no, you did. That's why he cried.
