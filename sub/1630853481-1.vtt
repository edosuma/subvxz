[Sgt Holdwick] <i> He wasn't</i>

00:44.044 --> 00:45.644
It was something else.

00:45.746 --> 00:47.312
[Former Deputy] <i> I knew</i>

00:48.416 --> 00:50.215
<i> The terrain was awful.</i>

This call comes out

01:35.062 --> 01:38.063
possibly overdosed
inside Century Village.

01:38.099 --> 01:40.632
Century Village being
the retirement community.

01:42.436 --> 01:45.237
We have had, in the past,
elderly people with

01:45.306 --> 01:48.507
you know, somebody is
terminal, they have
tried to take their pills,

01:48.509 --> 01:50.309
and do themselves in.

01:52.246 --> 01:54.513
That was where my mindset
went to initially,

01:54.515 --> 01:56.315
that it must be
an elderly couple.

[siren wailing]

01:58.719 --> 02:00.619
[Officer Anaya] <i> Officer Cusa</i>
<i> is the primary officer,</i>

02:00.621 --> 02:03.021
<i> and I was dispatched</i>
<i> as the backup.</i>

02:03.023 --> 02:04.656
<i> So, I am thinking,</i>
<i> I need to get there quick.</i>

02:04.758 --> 02:07.960
You don't know
what that other officer
can run into.

02:08.028 --> 02:09.228
You don't wanna
leave them alone.

02:10.331 --> 02:13.332
Century Village
is a city within a city.

02:14.201 --> 02:15.701
<i> The gate was very narrow</i>

02:15.703 --> 02:17.936
<i> with big concrete columns</i>

02:18.005 --> 02:20.606
that allowed just barely
one vehicle to pass through.

02:25.412 --> 02:28.113
<i> As I am pulling up,</i>
<i> I see security,</i>

02:28.115 --> 02:29.948

<i> at this vehicle.</i>

02:30.017 --> 02:31.717

02:33.053 --> 02:35.387
<i> I can see the male</i>

02:35.389 --> 02:37.756
<i> I could see a female</i>

02:37.858 --> 02:39.825
<i> Lo and behold,</i>
<i> they were in their 30s.</i>

02:40.761 --> 02:42.060
And, that struck me as odd

02:42.162 --> 02:43.762
because this is a
retirement community.

02:45.232 --> 02:46.498
<i> She was just</i>

<i> The gentleman,</i>

02:54.642 --> 02:57.743
<i> I can see little, clear</i>

<i> with an off-white</i>

03:01.015 --> 03:04.516
I couldn't tell
if it was heroin,
if it was cocaine.

03:04.518 --> 03:08.020
<i> But it definitely</i>
<i> was drug paraphernalia</i>
<i> of some sort.</i>

03:11.525 --> 03:14.326
<i> He's not there.</i>
<i> It's almost like it's</i>
<i> not registering yet</i>

03:14.328 --> 03:16.662
<i> what's going on and who I am</i>

03:16.730 --> 03:18.330
He just keeps, like,
looking around.

03:21.735 --> 03:25.137
I was very close
to where the address was,

03:25.239 --> 03:26.939
and I hadn't seen him yet.

03:26.941 --> 03:29.741
<i> So, I asked the dispatcher</i>
<i> to tell me again</i>

03:29.810 --> 03:31.210
<i> the building name.</i>

03:33.013 --> 03:36.048
[over radio]

03:51.765 --> 03:54.032
[Officer Cusack] <i> I am facin</i>
<i> the driver side window.</i>

03:54.034 --> 03:56.602
<i> Officer Anaya says, "What's</i>
<i> the name of the building?"</i>

03:56.604 --> 03:59.338
And, I say,
"Cambridge and Mike."

03:59.439 --> 04:01.707
<i> The driver, he hits the gas</i>

04:01.709 --> 04:04.209
And, when I say
he hits the gas,
he floors it.

04:05.546 --> 04:08.447
<i> The left side of the car</i>
<i> is now pushing up</i>
<i> against me.</i>

04:08.515 --> 04:11.450
<i> I am thinking,</i>
<i> "He's going to run me over.</i>

04:11.551 --> 04:13.252
<i> I'm gonna go</i>
<i> underneath this car,</i>

04:13.320 --> 04:14.953
and I may be crushed."

04:14.955 --> 04:16.154
<i> So, I take my right hand,</i>

04:16.256 --> 04:18.523
<i> and I grab</i>
<i> the top of the door frame.</i>

04:18.525 --> 04:21.426
<i> My heels are just</i>
<i> sliding across the ground.</i>

04:21.428 --> 04:25.063
I am literally skiing,
holding on to the door.

04:28.702 --> 04:30.902
<i> Within 30-40 feet,</i>

04:30.904 --> 04:33.805

04:38.712 --> 04:40.946
[siren blaring]

04:40.948 --> 04:43.815
[Officer Anaya] <i> As I am</i>
<i> approaching where he was,</i>

04:43.817 --> 04:47.619
the vehicle was coming
around the corner
at high rate of speed,

04:47.621 --> 04:49.855
and I saw Officer Cusack

04:49.923 --> 04:52.124
hanging from
the driver's side door.

04:52.126 --> 04:53.859
<i> It was really shocking to se</i>

04:53.927 --> 04:54.826
<i> I was thinking,</i>

04:54.961 --> 04:56.828
"How long is he
gonna get dragged?

04:56.830 --> 04:58.563
<i> How far is this car gonna go</i>

04:58.632 --> 05:00.232
<i> It just keeps speeding up."</i>

05:01.302 --> 05:03.702
So, I made a U-turn
to get behind the car.

05:10.311 --> 05:12.611
<i> I didn't want</i>
<i> to get too close</i>
<i> because I didn't want</i>

05:12.613 --> 05:14.546
Officer Cusack to
dislodge from the vehicle,

05:14.615 --> 05:16.648
and me strike him.

05:16.717 --> 05:19.051
<i> I knew that the potential</i>
<i> for me to get injured</i>

05:19.119 --> 05:21.053
went up the longer I held on.

05:21.055 --> 05:22.554
<i> But, he never slowed down.</i>

05:24.658 --> 05:27.259
<i> And then I realized</i>
<i> that he is purposely</i>

05:27.327 --> 05:29.428
<i> steering the vehicle</i>
<i> towards the tree line.</i>

05:30.531 --> 05:32.531
<i> These are not</i>
<i> little, small trees.</i>

05:32.533 --> 05:35.033
<i> These are huge, palm trees</i>

05:35.035 --> 05:36.835
<i> that have been there</i>
<i> for decades.</i>

05:38.038 --> 05:40.305
If I hit that tree,
there's no way
I'm surviving that.

05:41.942 --> 05:45.143
<i> Fortunately, he then</i>
<i> jerked the vehicle</i>
<i> back to the right.</i>

05:47.247 --> 05:50.415
[over radio]

06:09.703 --> 06:11.837
<i> As we are still travelling,</i>

06:11.905 --> 06:14.339
<i> he takes his left hand</i>
<i> and reaches up,</i>

06:14.408 --> 06:17.609
and starts to try
to pry my fingers
off the door frame.

06:24.318 --> 06:27.219
<i> It strikes me that</i>
<i> this is a person</i>
<i> without remorse,</i>

06:27.221 --> 06:29.254
and that, it doesn't matter
if he kills me.

06:30.023 --> 06:31.523
Doesn't matter if I die,
to him.

06:36.397 --> 06:38.430
<i> I threatened to shoot him</i>

06:38.432 --> 06:42.000
<i> because I felt, like,</i>
<i> maybe if I said this,</i>

06:42.002 --> 06:43.802
he would think about
what he is doing,
and go,

06:43.804 --> 06:45.604
"You know what?
It's not worth it."

07:06.059 --> 07:09.227
<i> That's about the time</i>
<i> that the body cam falls off</i>

07:11.131 --> 07:14.900
<i> My feet and legs are</i>
<i> now dragging behind me,</i>

07:14.902 --> 07:17.602
<i> and I am just holding on</i>

07:17.604 --> 07:19.704
as I am being pulled.

07:21.141 --> 07:24.609
<i> It's about 200-feet</i>
<i> till you hit the exit gate.</i>

07:24.611 --> 07:27.846
<i> I realized that</i>
<i> it's such a tight opening,</i>

07:27.915 --> 07:30.615
there's no way
that I'm going to
make it through

07:30.617 --> 07:32.317
with the door open.

07:32.319 --> 07:34.152
<i> Something's gonna</i>
<i> have to give.</i>

07:36.256 --> 07:39.024
<i> Right at the last second,</i>
<i> he brings the vehicle</i>
<i> to the right.</i>

07:39.726 --> 07:41.359
As he does that, I realize

07:41.428 --> 07:43.328
this is my only opportunity
to let go.

07:47.201 --> 07:49.501
<i> I tucked in,</i>
<i> I just brought my hands in.</i>

07:49.503 --> 07:52.504
<i> And, I basically absorbed</i>
<i> most of it on my forearms</i>

07:52.506 --> 07:54.206
<i> as I slid across the pavemen</i>

07:56.210 --> 07:58.243
[Officer Anaya] <i> When he was</i>
<i> dislodged from the vehicle,</i>

07:58.345 --> 08:01.546
<i> I quickly pulled over,</i>
<i> as close as I could, to him</i>

<i> He had a lot of injuries</i>
<i> to his elbows, his knees,</i>

08:06.052 --> 08:07.419

<i> The shoes were worn down,</i>
<i> there was no shoe.</i>

08:09.323 --> 08:11.423
<i> You could see</i>

all the way down
to the bone in one foot.

08:15.229 --> 08:17.829
<i> I can tell he had</i>
<i> a lot of adrenaline</i>
<i> running through his body.</i>

08:18.899 --> 08:20.165
<i> He wanted to get up,</i>

08:20.233 --> 08:22.634
<i> but he had so many injuries</i>
<i> to his feet</i>

08:22.736 --> 08:24.236
<i> that I wanted him to just</i>

08:24.337 --> 08:27.172
stay lying down
until rescue could
come to him.

08:33.614 --> 08:35.347
leading east
to Fort Lauderdale.

08:35.448 --> 08:37.315
I figured
that the suspect would

08:37.317 --> 08:38.950
potentially take that route.

<i> As I pull up</i>

he was actually
smoking a cigarette.

There's also

and place him into custody.

10:23.223 --> 10:25.056

[Officer Cusack] <i> I would</i>

12:09.229 --> 12:10.829
right up there, as far as,

12:10.831 --> 12:12.864
one of the
most traumatic events

12:12.933 --> 12:14.399
that I've ever been
involved in.

12:15.602 --> 12:18.703
<i> For a brief moment</i>
<i> I did consider,</i>

"Is it time for me
to think about
something else?

12:21.541 --> 12:23.475
Find a different career?"

12:23.477 --> 12:27.612
<i> My wife and my friends</i>
<i> were extremely supportive,</i>

12:27.614 --> 12:31.116
<i> and influential,</i>
<i> and basically telling me,</i>

12:31.118 --> 12:33.151
don't let this one incident

12:33.220 --> 12:34.452
define who you are,

12:34.521 --> 12:36.621
or allow it to change
who you are.

12:36.623 --> 12:38.256
<i> So, coming back to the road</i>

12:38.358 --> 12:40.692
<i> and being able to get back</i>
<i> in there,</i>

12:40.694 --> 12:42.127
<i> put the uniform back on,</i>

12:42.129 --> 12:43.795
<i> and go back on patrol,</i>

12:43.797 --> 12:47.098

the best thing for me.

Overall, when you

13:28.108 --> 13:31.543
[over radio]

13:45.826 --> 13:47.425
When responding
to domestic disturbance,

13:47.427 --> 13:48.726
you never understand

13:48.728 --> 13:50.295
what you are
going to deal with.

13:50.297 --> 13:52.831
<i> You can walk into</i>

13:52.833 --> 13:54.299

13:54.301 --> 13:55.733
<i> where everything</i>
<i> is breaking loose.</i>

13:57.103 --> 13:59.504
So, you really want
a primary officer,

13:59.506 --> 14:00.738
and a backup officer.

14:02.409 --> 14:04.008
<i> It's just me</i>

14:04.010 --> 14:05.443

14:06.479 --> 14:08.046

14:09.449 --> 14:12.217
We didn't approach
with sirens or lights,
of course,

14:12.219 --> 14:14.252

14:46.620 --> 14:48.219
<i> I see Corporal Mashuga.</i>

14:51.458 --> 14:54.325
I knock on the door,
I step back down the steps.

<i> At that time, the garage doo</i>

15:00.033 --> 15:02.500

15:03.937 --> 15:06.037
All she told me
is that he is drunk,

15:06.139 --> 15:07.405
he just needs to go to sleep.

15:09.309 --> 15:10.608
<i> I see out the corner of my e</i>

15:13.914 --> 15:17.015
<i> He had a handgun</i>
<i> pointed at me.</i>

15:17.017 --> 15:18.950
I was completely
taken by surprise.

15:19.286 --> 15:21.653
[gunshot]

15:21.754 --> 15:24.722
[Corporal Mashuga]
<i> As the shot was fired,</i>
<i> almost instantaneously,</i>

15:24.724 --> 15:27.859
<i> I could feel a sharp pain</i>
<i> in my stomach.</i>

15:29.562 --> 15:31.663
Officer Wilcox had arrived
on scene.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.231
<i> I was able to get back</i>

[Corporal Mashuga]

15:37.737 --> 15:39.203
[Officer Wilcox]

15:39.205 --> 15:40.805
Ultimately, he was just
trying to figure out,

15:41.408 --> 15:42.640
one, where he was shot.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.310
[Corporal Mashuga]

15:45.312 --> 15:46.945
And two, where is the shooter?

15:49.916 --> 15:52.216
<i> I didn't know</i>
<i> if this person</i>
<i> was coming after us.</i>

15:52.218 --> 15:53.618
I didn't know
if he was behind us.

An officer is hit.

[Officer Wilcox] <i> My partner</i>

17:21.207 --> 17:22.406

17:22.409 --> 17:24.742
because you've got armor
that covers your whole chest

17:24.811 --> 17:26.210
and this just happen to go,

17:26.212 --> 17:29.047
maybe an inch or two lower
than the armor was.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.117
<i> I mean, you've got</i>

17:33.119 --> 17:34.752

17:39.826 --> 17:41.726
[Corporal Mashuga] <i> I gave</i>

17:43.630 --> 17:45.630
Worrying about him
leaving the area,

17:45.632 --> 17:47.131
putting more officers at risk.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.208
[Officer Wilcox] <i> Out of the</i>

17:57.210 --> 17:59.310
<i> I see somebody standing</i>

18:04.717 --> 18:05.950
<i> Kind of clicked,</i>

18:05.952 --> 18:07.685
that was the person
that was at the garage.

[narrator] <i> The woman</i>

18:10.156 --> 18:12.623
<i> and was part of the</i>

18:24.037 --> 18:25.103
I thought at that point

18:25.105 --> 18:26.637
she was pretty
intoxicated, too.

18:34.747 --> 18:37.048
[Officer Thomas] <i> As we pull</i>
<i> on the scene,</i>

18:37.116 --> 18:39.851
<i> I've charged the weapon,</i>

18:39.952 --> 18:42.620
in case I have to
immediately use it.

18:45.125 --> 18:48.126
<i> We make it over to the</i>
<i> Centerville PD officer's car</i>

18:53.433 --> 18:54.632
So, officer Wilcox

18:54.734 --> 18:57.768
is explaining to me
what the situation is.

19:00.206 --> 19:01.706
[narrator] <i> More officers</i>
<i> arrive,</i>

19:05.111 --> 19:06.611

19:13.019 --> 19:15.520
Based on her actions
and statements,

19:15.522 --> 19:17.321
<i> obviously, she really wasn'</i>

19:17.323 --> 19:19.056
<i> coherent enough to comply.</i>

19:30.803 --> 19:33.804
I felt a large blow
to my right foot.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.208
<i> I am thinking,</i>
<i> you're kidding.</i>

19:37.210 --> 19:41.212
<i> You got shot earlier,</i>
<i> and here you are</i>
<i> getting shot again.</i>

19:41.214 --> 19:44.215
<i> So, I start scanning</i>

19:44.217 --> 19:46.217
I need to stop the threat.

19:48.054 --> 19:49.954
<i> Eventually, I see</i>
<i> his muzzle flashes.</i>

19:50.924 --> 19:53.024
So, I line up my sights
and I shoot at him.

19:59.332 --> 20:01.699
At that point I didn't know
whether I hit him or not.

20:11.110 --> 20:14.011
I knew Corporal Mashuga
was gonna need surgery

20:14.013 --> 20:16.113
for that abdominal wound.

20:16.115 --> 20:18.950
<i> I wanted to get him</i>

20:36.302 --> 20:37.935
[Officer Wilcox] <i> EMS was no</i>

20:37.937 --> 20:40.404
<i> to an active shooter</i>

20:40.406 --> 20:42.740
Only way to get
Corporal Mashuga out of there

20:42.842 --> 20:44.342
was to put him in my vehicle.

21:00.393 --> 21:02.226
<i> The only thought I had</i>

21:02.228 --> 21:03.828
<i> as fast as possible.</i>

21:03.830 --> 21:06.364
We didn't really have
a step-by-step game plan.

21:06.465 --> 21:09.300
It was just, one,
get out of there fast,

21:09.302 --> 21:11.502
and two, get him
to emergency medical care.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.039
[siren wailing]

21:26.619 --> 21:28.052
[police car siren wailing]

21:42.669 --> 21:44.802
[Officer Wilcox] So, as I am
headed to our local
medical center,

21:45.538 --> 21:47.104
at that point, they notify me

21:47.106 --> 21:49.407
that they do not deal with
gunshot wound victims.

21:56.449 --> 21:59.216
<i> So, we made the plan</i>
<i> to have EMS meet me,</i>

21:59.218 --> 22:00.718
<i> and exchange Corporal Mashug</i>

22:00.720 --> 22:02.520

22:17.203 --> 22:20.404
The shooter's sister
approaches an officer

22:20.406 --> 22:22.406
and gives the name
Harry Baggett.

22:31.317 --> 22:33.217
And, also informs him that

the suspect has been injured.

22:55.108 --> 22:58.342

<i> He's still obviously a threa</i>

23:22.402 --> 23:25.102
That's the first time
we realized that
he is still with us,

23:25.838 --> 23:27.138
after I shot him.

23:30.109 --> 23:31.842
I requested the BearCat

23:31.911 --> 23:34.311
because it's
an armored vehicle.

23:34.313 --> 23:37.014
<i> Attempting to get</i>

23:37.016 --> 23:38.716

23:38.718 --> 23:40.451
so that we can end
this whole situation

23:40.553 --> 23:42.820
without anybody else
getting injured.

23:55.601 --> 23:58.702
There's a procedure
that we go through

23:58.704 --> 24:00.604
whenever we have
barricaded gunman.

24:12.318 --> 24:15.820
there are ways that we can
coax them out of their house.

24:15.822 --> 24:17.688
[helicopter hovering]

24:17.690 --> 24:21.759
One of those ways is using
CS type of gases.

24:21.827 --> 24:25.062
[narrator] <i> CS gas</i>
<i> is commonly referred to as</i>
<i> tear gas.</i>

24:25.130 --> 24:26.296
[tear gas sound]

24:32.004 --> 24:36.006
The Houston County SRT
uses a 40-mm grenade launcher

24:36.008 --> 24:38.709
<i> to put these gases</i>
<i> through the window.</i>

24:45.318 --> 24:48.219

they removed a section of the

Businesses are closed,
schools are closed,

28:35.647 --> 28:36.947
lighter traffic.

28:39.719 --> 28:41.151
<i> Even though it was a Sunday</i>

28:41.153 --> 28:43.220
<i> there's still people drivin</i>
<i> in excess of the speed limit</i>

28:45.024 --> 28:46.757
<i> As this vehicle went past me</i>

28:46.859 --> 28:49.226
it was abundantly apparent
how fast he was going.

28:51.030 --> 28:53.530
<i> I immediately</i>
<i> put the car in gear,</i>

28:53.532 --> 28:55.232
<i> and went to go stop him.</i>

28:55.301 --> 28:56.800
[police car siren wailing]

28:59.839 --> 29:01.037
[narrator] <i> Just up the road</i>

29:01.107 --> 29:03.907
<i> is Macomb County Sherriff's</i>
<i> Deputy Jake Stark,</i>

29:03.909 --> 29:06.110
<i> and his trainee deputy.</i>

29:06.112 --> 29:09.012
Our dispatch aired
that Clinton Township
Police Department

29:09.014 --> 29:11.815
was chasing a suspect,
northbound on Dalcoma,

29:11.817 --> 29:13.117
exactly where we were.

29:14.553 --> 29:16.420
<i> We back them on big incident</i>

29:16.422 --> 29:19.256
We never want
any police officer
to be by himself.

29:20.693 --> 29:22.826
<i> In our minds, we ultimately</i>

29:22.828 --> 29:24.661
had to think
pretty quickly on our feet

29:24.663 --> 29:26.830
to try and get involved
in this pursuit.

29:34.507 --> 29:36.039
<i> I knew at that point</i>

29:36.141 --> 29:39.143
he wasn't running
simply because he didn't
want a traffic ticket.

29:39.211 --> 29:41.011
There was something else
going on.

29:42.214 --> 29:43.313
[narrator] <i> Back down the roa</i>

29:43.315 --> 29:45.048
<i> officers want to find out</i>

29:45.050 --> 29:48.218
<i> exactly what</i>
<i> the driver of the vehicle</i>
<i> was getting rid of.</i>

29:52.925 --> 29:54.291
[Deputy Stark] <i> When they</i>
<i> told us</i>

29:54.293 --> 29:56.426
<i> that the suspect had thrown</i>
<i> something out of the window</i>

29:56.428 --> 29:57.861
<i> we don't know what it is</i>
<i> at that time,</i>

29:57.897 --> 30:00.831
<i> which makes the chase</i>
<i> a little more serious.</i>

30:00.833 --> 30:03.300
We don't know what he is into,
or who he is.

30:09.241 --> 30:11.508
We don't for certain,
but there could be

30:11.510 --> 30:13.544
a potential of a weapon
inside that vehicle.

30:32.932 --> 30:35.499
I didn't know that
the Sheriff's department
was near

30:35.501 --> 30:37.201
until I looked into
my rearview mirror,

30:37.203 --> 30:38.735
<i> and saw their flashing light</i>

30:39.905 --> 30:41.805
[Deputy Stark] <i> When we</i>
<i> approached officer Holdwick</i>

30:41.807 --> 30:44.308
<i> we have to go</i>
<i> by what he is doing.</i>
<i> He is the lead officer,</i>

30:44.310 --> 30:46.043
<i> he's the one</i>
<i> in charge right now.</i>

30:46.078 --> 30:47.411
<i> It's not</i>
<i> like a normal pursuit.</i>

30:47.479 --> 30:49.813
You know,
the suspect was driving
at a slower rate of speed.

30:51.517 --> 30:53.350
[Sgt Holdwick] <i> As we</i>
<i> approached the first</i>
<i> traffic lights,</i>

30:53.419 --> 30:54.551
<i> the thing</i>
<i> that struck me as odd is,</i>

30:54.620 --> 30:56.420
<i> the car stopped</i>
<i> at the red light,</i>

30:56.422 --> 30:58.488
<i> like you would</i>
<i> for normal traffic.</i>

30:58.490 --> 31:01.825
<i> I've never seen</i>
<i> someone stop at red lights,</i>

31:01.827 --> 31:04.561
while they were
actually trying to get away.

31:11.003 --> 31:12.569
<i> When the vehicle stopped,</i>

31:12.571 --> 31:14.905
<i> my thought process</i>
<i> was that he was going to</i>
<i> open the door,</i>

31:14.907 --> 31:16.172
and take off running.

31:16.174 --> 31:19.543
And, it was
then going to
turn into a foot pursuit.

31:26.452 --> 31:28.252
But he continued to drive.

31:34.727 --> 31:36.727
[police car siren blaring]

31:40.566 --> 31:42.199
[Deputy Stark] <i> The best way</i>
<i> to get him to stop</i>

31:42.201 --> 31:44.101
<i> is to get him to slow down,</i>

31:45.437 --> 31:46.937
<i> and to get him boxed in,</i>

31:47.039 --> 31:49.106
<i> to allow him not to be able </i>
<i> go left or right.</i>

31:54.713 --> 31:57.114
<i> Unfortunately, we only had</i>
<i> two patrol cars at this time</i>

31:57.116 --> 31:59.616
So, he was able to
get out of our box.

32:18.203 --> 32:19.937
<i> So, as the pursuit</i>
<i> went northbound</i>
<i> on Van Dyke,</i>

32:19.939 --> 32:22.506
<i> approaching Hall Road,</i>
<i> we had a red light.</i>

32:22.508 --> 32:24.608
Hall Road would be
the last road,

32:24.677 --> 32:27.210
that I would pick to
run a red light at.

32:27.212 --> 32:29.513
<i> That's when things really go</i>
<i> serious for me.</i>

32:29.515 --> 32:31.682
There's a chance
that he is now
endangering the public.

32:34.720 --> 32:37.721
[police car siren blaring]

32:53.339 --> 32:54.805
[Officer Stark] <i> As we cross</i>
<i> Hall Road,</i>

32:54.807 --> 32:56.907
<i> you know, your mind</i>
<i> is going a thousand miles.</i>

32:56.909 --> 32:58.308
You wanna make sure and hope

32:58.310 --> 32:59.810
that the suspect
is not gonna crash.

33:02.014 --> 33:03.313
<i> There was one vehicle</i>
<i> in particular</i>

33:04.817 --> 33:06.950
<i> that he almost collided with</i>

33:07.019 --> 33:08.452
It was pretty close
to a miracle

33:08.553 --> 33:09.820
that nobody got
severely injured

33:09.822 --> 33:11.121
going through
those intersections.

33:17.563 --> 33:19.830
[Former Deputy] There were
other vehicles
that back-traced

33:19.832 --> 33:22.666
the steps of
where the pursuit was.

33:22.668 --> 33:24.835
<i> And then that's when</i>
<i> they found the narcotics.</i>

33:24.903 --> 33:26.603
[Deputy Stark] <i> Once we</i>
<i> found out there is narcotics</i>

33:26.705 --> 33:28.238
<i> there's a reason</i>
<i> he is running.</i>

33:28.340 --> 33:30.006
He could have
a lot more narcotics in there.

33:38.083 --> 33:40.617
[Officer Stark] <i> We don't kno</i>
<i> if he does have a gun</i>
<i> at this point.</i>

33:40.619 --> 33:44.221
<i> We did see him reach into</i>
<i> his center console</i>
<i> multiple times.</i>

33:44.223 --> 33:47.057
So that obviously has
heightened our awareness

33:47.159 --> 33:49.159
way more
than just a normal pursuit.

33:50.696 --> 33:53.330
<i> So, we are now</i>
<i> approximately 8-10 miles</i>

33:53.332 --> 33:56.133
<i> north of where</i>
<i> the actual pursuit started.</i>

33:56.234 --> 33:58.301
<i> We are trying to do</i>
<i> everything we can</i>
<i> to stop the suspect</i>

33:58.303 --> 33:59.669
<i> before he can continue.</i>

34:02.207 --> 34:04.708
<i> Once we turned eastbound</i>
<i> on 27 Mile Road,</i>

34:04.710 --> 34:06.710
his speeds definitely
were increased.

34:20.025 --> 34:22.059
[Sgt Holdwick] <i> We are enteri</i>
<i> more of a farm land.</i>

34:22.528 --> 34:23.593
More dirt roads,

34:23.595 --> 34:26.229
getting away from subdivisions
and neighborhoods,

34:26.231 --> 34:27.631
and more into open country.

34:30.436 --> 34:32.936
<i> We actually had</i>
<i> a second Clinton Township ca</i>

34:32.938 --> 34:34.704
<i> joining the pursuit.</i>

34:34.806 --> 34:36.706
<i> We could see</i>
<i> the Sheriff's Department</i>
<i> vehicle ahead</i>

34:36.808 --> 34:38.708
<i> with its overhead</i>
<i> lights activated.</i>

34:47.820 --> 34:50.220
[Deputy Stark] <i> There's no ca</i>
<i> in plain sight.</i>

34:50.222 --> 34:52.122
<i> It's a country-style road.</i>

34:53.926 --> 34:56.626
<i> Knowing the road</i>
<i> and knowing we were at,</i>

34:56.695 --> 34:59.129
<i> I knew we would hit gravel</i>
<i> at that rate of speed.</i>

34:59.131 --> 35:01.031
There's a good chance
that one of us
could lose control.

35:04.670 --> 35:06.670
[Former Deputy] <i> As soon as</i>
<i> we hit the dirt road,</i>

35:06.672 --> 35:09.706
I knew that this chase
was gonna end soon.

35:20.052 --> 35:21.818
<i> I knew that his options</i>

35:21.820 --> 35:24.221
<i> of where he was gonna go,</i>
<i> was running thin.</i>

35:26.859 --> 35:28.859
<i> And, now we're</i>
<i> going into an area</i>

35:28.960 --> 35:30.927
<i> that we are not</i>
<i> 100% familiar with.</i>

35:31.864 --> 35:33.797
<i> But he may be</i>
<i> very familiar with.</i>

35:34.800 --> 35:37.400
I did consider
that there was the potential

35:37.402 --> 35:39.536
of us getting involved
in some sort of ambush.

35:50.249 --> 35:53.116
[Former Deputy] <i> When he</i>
<i> started slowing up</i>
<i> as we are behind him,</i>

35:53.118 --> 35:54.351
<i> I wanted to have the advanta</i>

35:54.452 --> 35:55.919
<i> of having my door</i>
<i> somewhat open.</i>

35:57.422 --> 35:59.055
<i> If he fled on foot,</i>

35:59.157 --> 36:01.057
I get out,
and then chase him on foot.

36:05.998 --> 36:08.698
[Deputy Stark] <i> My number on</i>
<i> concern was does he know</i>
<i> the people that live here?</i>

36:08.700 --> 36:11.101
<i> Are there going to be peopl</i>
<i> waiting for us</i>
<i> behind the house?</i>

36:11.103 --> 36:12.502
We don't know at that time,

36:12.504 --> 36:13.803
so, our awareness

36:13.805 --> 36:15.438
is definitely very high.

36:19.711 --> 36:22.946
<i> There was dense woods</i>
<i> behind the house</i>
<i> that he went into.</i>

36:23.949 --> 36:26.082
<i> I knew that as he</i>
<i> pulled in that driveway,</i>

36:26.084 --> 36:28.418
<i> that he was gonna</i>
<i> make a dash for those woods</i>

36:34.226 --> 36:35.891
<i> I saw</i>
<i> that there was a big ditch.</i>

36:38.230 --> 36:41.131
<i> Unfortunately, the suspect</i>
<i> was able to up and over</i>
<i> that ditch,</i>

36:41.934 --> 36:43.500
<i> and then crash</i>
<i> into a set of trees.</i>

36:44.503 --> 36:45.936
And then, took off on foot.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.806
<i> I am not familiar</i>
<i> with the area.</i>

36:49.808 --> 36:51.675
<i> We don't know</i>
<i> what he is doing out there,</i>

36:51.677 --> 36:53.009
<i> we don't know</i>
<i> if he has a gun on him.</i>

36:55.414 --> 36:57.347
<i> It definitely makes it</i>
<i> lot more dangerous.</i>

37:01.787 --> 37:04.521
[Former Deputy] <i> As the vehic</i>
<i> is approaching the backyard</i>
<i> I'm thinking in my mind,</i>

37:04.523 --> 37:07.123
<i> this individual</i>
<i> could either have</i>
<i> more drugs on him,</i>

37:07.125 --> 37:08.959
or the biggest thing is,
he has a weapon.

37:10.128 --> 37:13.029
<i> Deputy Stark began</i>
<i> pursuing him on foot.</i>

37:13.031 --> 37:14.264
<i> I went the other way,</i>

37:14.333 --> 37:16.433
<i> opposite of</i>
<i> where he was going,</i>

37:16.534 --> 37:19.536
<i> so that all points of entry</i>
<i> were covered.</i>

37:19.638 --> 37:21.938
And, all the points
of him exiting the field

37:21.940 --> 37:23.239
were covered as well.

37:24.543 --> 37:26.209
[Deputy Stark] <i> As we see</i>
<i> his car come to a stop,</i>

37:26.812 --> 37:28.178
<i> there's wood everywhere.</i>

37:28.180 --> 37:30.313
<i> We don't know</i>
<i> where he is at that point.</i>

37:45.831 --> 37:48.164
<i> Fortunately for us,</i>
<i> I was able to locate him,</i>

37:48.233 --> 37:49.599
<i> give him</i>
<i> multiple verbal commands</i>

37:49.668 --> 37:51.401
<i> to stop, stop running,</i>

37:51.403 --> 37:53.536
<i> let him know that</i>
<i> the police are here.</i>

37:53.638 --> 37:55.438
And he continued
to run on foot.

37:58.877 --> 38:00.343
[Former Deputy] <i> The terrain</i>
<i> was awful.</i>

38:00.412 --> 38:02.412
<i> We didn't know</i>
<i> exactly what was in the wate</i>

38:02.414 --> 38:04.447
<i> We didn't know</i>
<i> if there were any trenches,</i>

38:04.516 --> 38:05.949
<i> or if the water was</i>
<i> going to get deeper.</i>

38:06.051 --> 38:07.350
<i> We had no idea.</i>

38:09.087 --> 38:11.621
<i> If I'm in deep waters,</i>
<i> and he's out of deep waters</i>

38:11.623 --> 38:13.923
<i> and, he does engage me,</i>

38:13.925 --> 38:15.058
I am an open target.

38:19.364 --> 38:20.664
<i> The further</i>
<i> we got into the woods,</i>

38:20.666 --> 38:22.231
<i> the more water there was.</i>

38:24.036 --> 38:26.536
<i> There was probably a good</i>
<i> 1-and-a-half</i>
<i> to 2-feet of water,</i>

38:26.638 --> 38:28.038
<i> that we are running through</i>

38:28.040 --> 38:30.907
<i> which makes our clothes</i>
<i> that much more weighted down</i>

38:34.246 --> 38:37.147
<i> I was approximately 30 yard</i>
<i> from where the suspect was.</i>

38:38.950 --> 38:40.617
<i> All I was trying to do</i>
<i> was keep an eye on him,</i>

38:42.421 --> 38:43.953
<i> even if didn't gain</i>
<i> ground on him.</i>

38:46.058 --> 38:48.258
I didn't know if I was
going to encounter him

38:48.360 --> 38:50.527
laying down, behind the tree.

38:52.964 --> 38:55.031
<i> I didn't know</i>
<i> if I was walking</i>
<i> into an ambush.</i>

38:56.802 --> 38:59.102
<i> I didn't know</i>
<i> if I had to engage</i>
<i> this individual,</i>

38:59.104 --> 39:02.405
<i> if this individual</i>
<i> was going to start</i>
<i> firing upon me.</i>

39:04.209 --> 39:06.209
[Deputy Stark] <i> There's</i>
<i> multiple times</i>
<i> when he looked back</i>

39:06.211 --> 39:07.344
<i> to see where we were.</i>

39:07.346 --> 39:09.312
<i> But, we don't know</i>
<i> why he's looking back at us</i>

39:09.314 --> 39:11.514
<i> We don't know if he has</i>
<i> a gun in his hand.</i>

39:18.323 --> 39:20.724
<i> The terrain</i>
<i> that we are running through</i>

39:20.726 --> 39:22.359
was a lot of water.

39:22.427 --> 39:23.893
We got tired, he got tired.

39:33.305 --> 39:37.240
[Former Deputy] <i> I was</i>
<i> trying to find</i>
<i> any sort of tree,</i>

39:37.342 --> 39:39.409
<i> or any thick brush</i>

39:39.411 --> 39:41.611
<i> that I can get behind,</i>

39:41.680 --> 39:44.614
and get some form
of concealment.

39:45.817 --> 39:48.318
<i> I was keeping my eye</i>
<i> out for him</i>

39:48.320 --> 39:49.819
<i> because I didn't know</i>
<i> exactly where he was.</i>

39:56.161 --> 39:58.328
[Former Deputy] <i> I knew</i>
<i> the general direction</i>
<i> of travel,</i>

39:58.330 --> 40:00.797
<i> and I can see a break</i>

40:00.799 --> 40:02.899
<i> that opened up</i>
<i> to a more open area.</i>

40:04.503 --> 40:06.136
When I saw that,
I thought to myself,

40:06.204 --> 40:07.771
"Okay, this is where
the suspect is going."

40:08.874 --> 40:10.340
[Deputy Stark] <i> Fortunately,</i>
<i> I was able to see</i>

40:10.442 --> 40:12.308
<i> his hands to know</i>
<i> that he didn't have</i>
<i> any weapons</i>

40:12.310 --> 40:13.910
<i> in his hand at the time.</i>

40:13.912 --> 40:15.412
And that he was probably
just looking to see

40:15.414 --> 40:16.413
exactly where we were.

40:32.664 --> 40:34.431
<i> I come out of the woods,</i>

40:34.433 --> 40:36.800
<i> and at that point,</i>
<i> I know his hands</i>
<i> are in the air,</i>

40:36.802 --> 40:38.802
<i> but we don't know</i>
<i> if he can make any</i>
<i> sudden movement.</i>

40:38.903 --> 40:40.437
<i> So, I do pull my gun.</i>

40:42.908 --> 40:46.609
<i> I could hear my trainee,</i>
<i> along with another officer,</i>

40:46.611 --> 40:47.811
<i> yelling verbal commands,</i>

40:47.879 --> 40:49.512
<i> for him to get down</i>
<i> on the ground,</i>

40:49.514 --> 40:50.780
<i> and put his hand</i>
<i> behind his back.</i>

40:52.250 --> 40:54.017
Once I hear that,
my adrenaline is running.

41:16.541 --> 41:18.875
We eventually take the suspect
into custody.

41:26.351 --> 41:29.018
[narrator] <i> The items thrown</i>
<i> out of the suspect's car</i>

41:29.020 --> 41:30.720

<i> The suspect is</i>
<i> Aniano-Arialo Mora.</i>

41:50.709 --> 41:53.243

Anytime that you assist
another department

42:03.054 --> 42:04.554
in a big incident,

42:05.323 --> 42:06.322
we're all one team.

42:07.425 --> 42:08.457
<i> At the end of the day,</i>

42:08.459 --> 42:09.926

42:09.928 --> 42:11.227

42:16.701 --> 42:19.302
Nobody wearing a badge
got hurt that day,

42:19.304 --> 42:21.905
<i> no civilians were injured</i>
<i> that day,</i>

42:21.907 --> 42:23.606
<i> the suspect wasn't injured</i>
<i> that day.</i>

42:24.309 --> 42:25.341
That's ultimately

42:25.410 --> 42:26.509
what you want,

42:27.212 --> 42:28.244
being in law enforcement.
