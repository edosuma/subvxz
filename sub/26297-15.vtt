00:01.349 --> 00:03.177
ADULT ADAM:
Ah, Valentine's Day.

00:03.220 --> 00:06.745
Back in the '80s, you couldn't just text a heart emoji to show you cared.

00:06.789 --> 00:11.707
Nope, back then, you had
to make your love known
face-to-face.

00:11.750 --> 00:13.013
What'd you get me,
Johnny?

00:13.056 --> 00:16.494
Best gift of all,
5'9" of thunder
wrapped in a Rush T-shirt.

00:16.538 --> 00:18.670
That is the hottest way
to say you got me nothing.

00:18.714 --> 00:20.063
I love you, baby.

00:23.110 --> 00:24.937
Hey, JTP.
ALL: JTP!

00:24.981 --> 00:27.679
Everywhere I turn, I see
canoodling and smooches.

00:27.723 --> 00:29.290
Enough already!

00:29.333 --> 00:30.856
Don't they know
I'll never love again?

00:30.900 --> 00:32.293
Just forget about Lainey,
all right?

00:32.336 --> 00:34.686
Let the JTP
be your Valentine.

00:34.730 --> 00:35.644
It's just not the same.

00:35.687 --> 00:37.124
Oh, yeah? Check it!

00:37.167 --> 00:38.342
A stuffed croc
ready to rock.

00:38.386 --> 00:40.127
Dude, you guys
just get me!

00:40.170 --> 00:41.737
And that's not all...

00:41.780 --> 00:44.305
A grappling hook
and Hubba Bubba Bubble Tape?

00:44.348 --> 00:47.003
Thanks, guys.
I'm feeling better already.

00:47.047 --> 00:49.832
ADULT ADAM: As for me,
my girlfriend, Jackie,
had the best gift of all.

00:49.875 --> 00:51.790
There's my Valentine!

00:51.834 --> 00:53.227
I know we agreed
no gifts, but...

00:54.054 --> 00:55.490
Teddy Ruxpin!

00:55.533 --> 00:57.144
Aww, I loved
this little guy!

00:57.187 --> 01:00.060
Well, now I think you're gonna
love him even more.

01:01.496 --> 01:03.454
JACKIE'S VOICE:
Happy Valentine's Day, Addy!

01:03.498 --> 01:06.066
Don't mean to
"em-bear-rass" you,

01:06.109 --> 01:07.980
but you're my honey!

01:08.024 --> 01:09.721
It's Jackie, by the way.
Your girlfriend.

01:09.765 --> 01:11.027
Hope this isn't
confusing.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.420
Oh, my God, not at all!

01:12.463 --> 01:14.726
I mean, at first,
I was like wha...

01:14.770 --> 01:17.033
But now I'm like aww!

01:17.077 --> 01:18.687
Teddy Ruxpin
makes everything awesome.

01:18.730 --> 01:20.341
Well, just you wait,

01:20.384 --> 01:23.257
'cause I planned an even
awesomer Valentine's week.

01:23.300 --> 01:25.172
It starts off tonight,
when we make

01:25.215 --> 01:27.565
the most romantic food
of all time.

01:27.609 --> 01:29.089
Pizza?
Indeed!

01:29.132 --> 01:30.916
And then Friday
is the big night,

01:30.960 --> 01:32.701
when we go
to a drive-in movie

01:32.744 --> 01:34.964
to see the most
romantic film ever.

01:35.007 --> 01:36.574
Twins!
You know it!

01:36.618 --> 01:39.099
It's basically our story!
But not at all!

01:39.142 --> 01:41.971
Obviously!
Hey! Don Juan!

01:42.014 --> 01:43.146
We're in the middle
of class!

01:44.147 --> 01:45.975
Cupid-Gram
for Adam Goldberg.

01:47.237 --> 01:48.978
Jackie,
this is too much.

01:49.021 --> 01:50.371
Those aren't from me.

01:50.414 --> 01:52.373
What?
But then who...

01:52.416 --> 01:54.418
"To my little
schmoopaloo..."

01:54.462 --> 01:55.593
Oh, balls! Stop!

01:55.637 --> 01:57.987
"I know you're all grown up,
but you'll never be too old

01:58.030 --> 02:01.338
"to be mama's number-one
mushy-tushed Valentine baby."

02:01.382 --> 02:03.558
But the next sentence
says,

02:03.601 --> 02:06.387
"Just kidding, I'm your mom,
and I have clear boundaries."

02:06.430 --> 02:08.650
I'm thinking maybe
we make pizza at my house?

02:08.693 --> 02:10.173
Don't worry.

02:10.217 --> 02:12.219
This year,
Valentine's is only about us.

02:14.177 --> 02:16.005
You call that a crust,
Jackie?

02:16.048 --> 02:17.789
Did you even
work the dough?

02:17.833 --> 02:20.009
Ugh.
Watch and learn.

02:20.052 --> 02:23.099
Mom, please!
This is supposed to
be a romantic pizza...

ADULT ADAM:
It was February 13th,
1980-something,

02:38.288 --> 02:40.638
and my sister
was desperately trying

02:40.682 --> 02:42.031
to put the pieces of her band back together

02:42.074 --> 02:43.163
after losing Lainey.

02:46.296 --> 02:48.255
Whoo! So awesome!

02:48.298 --> 02:51.258
Geoff, please.
We all know there's
no band without Lainey.

02:51.301 --> 02:53.782
Yeah. She was
the one who taught me
you can read music.

02:53.825 --> 02:56.654
And I was like,
"No, Lainey, you hear music."

02:56.698 --> 02:57.829
And she was like,
"No, you can read it, too."

02:57.873 --> 02:59.918
And I was like, "Whoa."

02:59.962 --> 03:02.747
Oh, come on. You guys
can't just give up now.

03:02.791 --> 03:05.010
How about I help you hold
auditions to replace Lainey?

03:05.054 --> 03:07.883
Hon, i-it's really sweet
how you're always
taking care of me,

This is a fun, little ditty.
It's 17 minutes long,

that stands outside the Wawa

03:45.137 --> 03:46.617

for high school kids?

03:46.661 --> 03:47.836
Five for you,

03:47.879 --> 03:49.533
No,
I remember the rule.

03:49.577 --> 03:52.101
I can play lead or rhythm,
as long as there's a couch
for me to crash on.

03:52.144 --> 03:53.407
No offense,
but you should
probably leave.

03:56.279 --> 03:59.369
Maybe we should
just settle for the charming,
old banjo man.

03:59.413 --> 04:00.979
Don't worry.
There's still one person left.

04:01.023 --> 04:03.417
See, I was putting up a flyer
at the Kremps' flower store,

04:03.460 --> 04:05.723

at the register.
He's actually their nephew.

04:05.767 --> 04:06.942
Pass.
Lame.

04:06.985 --> 04:08.465
But he's only there helping
for the Valentine's rush.

04:08.509 --> 04:10.728
See, he's from Boston,
he writes songs,

04:10.772 --> 04:12.077
and he's actually
upstairs right now.

04:12.121 --> 04:13.862
Evan, they're ready!
Damn it, Geoff!

04:13.905 --> 04:16.778

04:21.478 --> 04:22.914

for a guitarist.

04:22.958 --> 04:24.264
Yep.

04:24.307 --> 04:25.656

ADULT ADAM:
As The Dropouts
got the perfect gift,

05:17.665 --> 05:20.711
my mom stumbled on her own
Valentine's present.

05:20.755 --> 05:23.845
Damn it, Murray! I almost
broke my neck on your pants!

05:23.888 --> 05:25.803
What? Everybody knows
my pants go by the front door.

05:25.847 --> 05:28.240
What have we here?

05:28.284 --> 05:29.633
Oh, stop.
Don't look at that.

05:29.677 --> 05:31.374
It's not even
Valentine's Day yet.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.071
I bet I know
what it is...

05:33.115 --> 05:36.597
A fancy assortment
of Jagielky's Candies!

05:36.640 --> 05:38.207
You loved them
for the last 18 years,

05:38.250 --> 05:39.948
so I thought
I'd buy 'em again!

05:39.991 --> 05:42.559
"Dear Bevy,
you're as sweet as candy."

05:42.603 --> 05:44.300
Murray!

05:44.344 --> 05:46.607
I wrote it last year,
so I knew you'd love it again!

05:46.650 --> 05:49.000
See, this is what I love
about Valentine's Day.

05:49.044 --> 05:52.221
I get candies
and notes and dinner
with my special guy.

05:52.264 --> 05:54.571
I made us reservations,
pickle.

05:55.703 --> 05:57.487
Wait, me?

05:57.531 --> 05:59.750
I can't be your
Valentine pickle
this year.

05:59.794 --> 06:02.536
But I made us a reservation
at the new Moroccan place.

06:02.579 --> 06:04.581
It's fun 'cause you get
to eat with your hands.

06:04.625 --> 06:06.496
But it's also disgusting,

06:06.540 --> 06:08.237
so I will be sneaking
some silverware in my purse.

06:08.280 --> 06:09.630
Fun!

06:09.673 --> 06:12.197
No! I'm taking Jackie
to the drive-in.

06:12.241 --> 06:13.547
They're playing
the movie Twins.

06:13.590 --> 06:15.766
You are not
bailing on your mom

06:15.810 --> 06:17.812

Arnold Schwarzenegger
in a comedy.

06:17.855 --> 06:19.770
The Terminator
can't be twins

06:19.814 --> 06:21.424

from Taxi.

06:21.468 --> 06:23.295
It makes no sense.
But they did it!

06:23.339 --> 06:25.036
He's the big,
muscle-y twin,

06:25.080 --> 06:27.299
and Danny DeVito
is the little, squishy one.

06:27.343 --> 06:28.997
It's funny, 'cause
that's not how twins work!

06:29.040 --> 06:30.868
Well, you don't
have to see Twins,

06:30.912 --> 06:32.609
because we're
gonna be twins.

06:32.653 --> 06:34.698
I'll go grab
our matching sweaters.

06:36.047 --> 06:37.092
This is your fault.

06:41.270 --> 06:43.315

before you kids were born,

06:43.359 --> 06:46.536
I used to disappoint
your mother every
Valentine's Day.

06:46.580 --> 06:48.103
And you know why?
Because you're the worst

06:48.146 --> 06:49.844
with words, stuff,
and emotions?

06:49.887 --> 06:53.151
Bingo!
But then you kids came along
and stole all her love.

06:53.195 --> 06:54.283
Now everybody wins!

07:01.725 --> 07:03.335
Hey, Mr. Kremp.
You got a sec?

07:03.379 --> 07:06.817
I told your mom,
she can't make
her own coupons.

07:06.861 --> 07:08.428
We were wondering
if your nephew Evan's around.

07:08.471 --> 07:10.299
Oh, hey. Sup?

07:10.342 --> 07:12.475
Just here to say congrats.
Welcome to the band.

07:12.519 --> 07:13.737
Oh. Sweet.

07:13.781 --> 07:15.260
Um, question...

07:15.304 --> 07:18.307
Will your girlfriend
be coming to practice
or anything?

07:18.350 --> 07:19.351
I don't have
a girlfriend.

07:20.527 --> 07:22.398
These are for you.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.052
Sure. Yeah, that's, uh...
That's $6.99.

07:24.095 --> 07:25.314
I have no money.

07:27.229 --> 07:30.406
Enjoy your totally normal
welcome-to-the-band bouquet.

nephew Evan,

Erica doesn't like
guys like Evan.

08:07.225 --> 08:08.575
She's more into
the supportive fella

08:08.618 --> 08:10.011
who claps
from the sidelines.

08:10.054 --> 08:12.448
They're sharing a single
microphone, dude!

08:12.492 --> 08:13.536
So?

08:13.580 --> 08:15.930
Sharing a mic
is the musical equivalent

08:15.973 --> 08:17.671
of Frenching
under a waterfall.

08:17.714 --> 08:18.802
Oh, God!

08:18.846 --> 08:21.457
W-W-What is this heat I feel
rising in my throat?

08:21.501 --> 08:24.416
That's called jealousy,
my friend. Embrace it.

08:24.460 --> 08:26.375
M-My chest hurts,
and so do my eyes.

08:26.418 --> 08:27.681
Then it's time
you learn.

08:27.724 --> 08:30.161
There's only one way
to keep Erica...

08:30.205 --> 08:33.208
Harness the thing
women crave most.

08:33.251 --> 08:35.471
Irrational behavior.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.820
Dude,
I-I'm spinning out,

08:36.864 --> 08:38.648
even though this all
sounds so wrong!

08:38.692 --> 08:41.216
Is it? How do you think I got
a smoke-show like Lainey?

08:41.259 --> 08:43.479
No one knows.
It's 'cause I was loud,

08:43.523 --> 08:46.787
passionate, crazy possessive,
and easily threatened.

08:46.830 --> 08:48.223
But you're not
with Lainey anymore.

08:48.266 --> 08:50.965
'Cause the one time
I was a supportive
nice guy, like you,

08:51.008 --> 08:52.488
she ditched me for L.A.

08:52.532 --> 08:53.620
Dude, I never
thought of it like that.

08:53.663 --> 08:55.404
You got to help me
not wind up like you

08:55.447 --> 08:56.927
by acting
exactly like you.

08:56.971 --> 08:59.974
Let's go warm up by screaming
at clouds that look like Evan.

09:00.017 --> 09:01.236
Yeah! Ooh!

09:01.279 --> 09:03.630
ADULT ADAM: While Geoff was joining forces with Barry,

09:03.673 --> 09:06.371
I had no choice
but to break up
with my mom.

09:06.415 --> 09:08.896
There's
my little love bug!

09:08.939 --> 09:10.506
Who's ready for our adventure
down the street

09:10.550 --> 09:12.508
to faraway,
ancient Morocco?

09:12.552 --> 09:15.555
About that.
We need to talk.

09:15.598 --> 09:18.688
Oh, no.
That doesn't sound good.

09:18.732 --> 09:21.082
Listen, we've had
a lot of good times together.

09:21.125 --> 09:22.562
Oh, my God,
it's getting worse.

09:22.605 --> 09:24.215
Have I done
something wrong?

09:24.259 --> 09:26.261
It's not you.
It's me.

09:26.304 --> 09:28.393
About our whole
dinner thing...

09:28.437 --> 09:31.135
Maybe it's time
we go our separate ways.

09:31.179 --> 09:33.660
Seriously?
You're gonna do this
to me on Valentine's Day?

09:33.703 --> 09:35.966
There's never
a right time.

09:36.010 --> 09:38.447
I just think it'd be healthy
for us to see other people.

09:38.490 --> 09:40.797
Like, specifically,
my girlfriend
and your husband.

09:40.841 --> 09:43.017
Wow.

09:43.060 --> 09:45.062
I just thought
this would last
forever, you know?

09:45.106 --> 09:46.803
I know it's hard
for you to see right now,

09:46.847 --> 09:48.152
but this is the best
for both of us.

09:49.763 --> 09:50.938
Well, I guess
it's time to move on.

09:53.723 --> 09:55.769
Murray!
It's you and me Friday night!

09:55.812 --> 09:56.900
We're getting Moroccan!

09:56.944 --> 09:58.249
What?

09:59.294 --> 10:00.904
What have you done?

10:00.948 --> 10:02.645
Have fun. You're gonna love
sitting on the floor.

10:02.689 --> 10:03.994
For the whole meal?

10:04.038 --> 10:06.301
I can't even prop myself
up against the wall?

10:06.344 --> 10:08.956
Just you on the floor,
sitting on a colorful,
scratchy pillow.

10:08.999 --> 10:10.479
I-I can't do this!
My body will give out!

10:10.522 --> 10:11.959
Hey,
it's outta my hands.

10:12.002 --> 10:13.830
But it's Valentine's Day!

10:13.874 --> 10:16.441
She's gonna want to talk
about love and feelings.

10:16.485 --> 10:18.008
That's not my thing!

10:18.052 --> 10:19.706
Bring me back a handful
of that wet potato stuff,
big guy.

10:19.749 --> 10:21.055
Beep, beep!

10:21.098 --> 10:23.013
ADULT ADAM:
Yep, that weekend,
my Valentine's Day

10:23.057 --> 10:25.146
was finally gonna be mom-free.

10:25.189 --> 10:26.364
Or so I thought.

10:26.408 --> 10:28.062
There's my little
love monkey.

10:28.105 --> 10:29.498
Mom,
we've discussed this.

10:29.541 --> 10:31.674
I'm insanely too old
for tuckies.

10:31.718 --> 10:33.154
Oh, I'm not here
for tuckies.

10:33.197 --> 10:35.286
I'm here to see the man
who felt so bad

10:35.330 --> 10:37.332
about bailing
on our Moroccan feast

10:37.375 --> 10:40.161
that he poured his heart out
into a Valentine poem.

10:40.204 --> 10:41.292
Valen-what-now?

10:41.336 --> 10:44.339
The boy felt so guilty,
he wrote you a poem?

10:44.382 --> 10:45.601
This, I got to hear.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.734
Uh, hear what?

10:49.257 --> 10:52.695
"Her heart, more precious
than all of Earth's jewels.

10:54.566 --> 10:58.527
"Her love, deeper than
the ocean's darkest canyons.

10:58.570 --> 11:03.184
"Her embrace,
a home I will live in forever.

11:03.227 --> 11:05.708
"And I call
this safe place...

11:05.752 --> 11:07.101
"Mama."

11:07.144 --> 11:08.668
Whoa.

11:08.711 --> 11:11.061
Wow.

11:11.105 --> 11:14.195
I have to take you
to a Valentine's dinner now,

11:14.238 --> 11:15.587
if it's okay
with your father.

11:15.631 --> 11:17.415
Oh-ho-ho,
this is the kind of love

11:17.459 --> 11:18.808
I don't want
to get in the way of.

11:18.852 --> 11:20.418
I love my Murray.

11:20.462 --> 11:23.030
Gnah!

11:23.073 --> 11:26.511
Damn you
and your shockingly
beautiful prose!

11:26.555 --> 11:29.601
When I get cornered,
I come out fighting.

11:29.645 --> 11:31.255
Well,
this isn't over, sir!

11:31.299 --> 11:32.866
Not by a long shot!

11:32.909 --> 11:34.911
And with that,
it was father versus son

11:34.955 --> 11:38.306
in the battle
to ditch Beverly Goldberg.

11:38.349 --> 11:40.003
ADULT ADAM: Geoff was ready
to harness jealousy,

11:40.047 --> 11:41.962
and Barry was his teacher.

11:42.005 --> 11:44.138
JTP, I've gathered
you all here today

11:44.181 --> 11:46.314
to ensure young Geoffrey
doesn't get ditched

11:46.357 --> 11:47.489
for a super-hot
guitarist.

11:47.532 --> 11:48.664
They shared
a microphone!

11:48.708 --> 11:50.579
Oh, that's bad.
So intimate!

11:50.622 --> 11:52.015
It's like Frenching
under a waterfall!

11:52.059 --> 11:54.322
Luckily, I'm here
to shepherd Geoff

11:54.365 --> 11:57.412
into the world of anger
and unreasonable passion.

11:57.455 --> 11:58.935
First, we role-play.

11:58.979 --> 12:00.981
Andy, you'll be Erica.
Okay.

12:01.024 --> 12:03.766
Um, actually,
I'd like to play Erica.

12:03.810 --> 12:05.463
I'm more than just a guy
who likes to be naked.

12:05.507 --> 12:06.813
I have range, you know?

12:06.856 --> 12:09.816
I'd like to also
throw my hat in the ring
for the role of Erica.

12:09.859 --> 12:12.209
I mean, feel how soft
my hands are.

12:12.253 --> 12:13.907
Fine!
You can all be Erica.

12:13.950 --> 12:15.125
Boom!
Finally!

12:15.169 --> 12:18.346
Let's do this!
And I'm cool guitar guy
Evan Dando.

12:18.389 --> 12:19.782
Hey.

12:19.826 --> 12:22.480
Check out my cool hair
and... Butt.

12:22.524 --> 12:24.395
How 'bout I serenade you

12:24.439 --> 12:28.617
while your pushover boyfriend
just watches?

12:28.660 --> 12:30.706
Geoff who?
Aah!

12:30.750 --> 12:33.013
You, sir, you go now!
Begone with you!

12:33.056 --> 12:34.928
The intensity is right.
The words are weird.

12:34.971 --> 12:36.843
I want you to leave
at your earliest convenience,

12:36.886 --> 12:38.801
and I'm not joshing around,
buckaroo!

12:38.845 --> 12:41.543
More rage! Less like
you traveled here
from the past.

12:41.586 --> 12:43.197
Quick!
Throw something!

12:43.240 --> 12:44.981
Aah! Aah... Aah...

12:45.025 --> 12:46.809
Aah! Aah!

12:46.853 --> 12:49.638
Dude! Not cool!
That's my mom's lamp!

12:49.681 --> 12:50.639
Oh, no!
I'm so sorry!

12:50.682 --> 12:52.641
Never apologize.
I'm not sorry!

12:52.684 --> 12:53.729
But you broke her lamp.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.513
I feel terrible!
Am I in trouble?

12:55.557 --> 12:56.645
Yes!

12:56.688 --> 12:58.690
But you love trouble!
I regret nothing!

12:58.734 --> 13:00.997
Now go down there
and win back my sister

13:01.041 --> 13:02.172
by acting
like her brother!

13:02.216 --> 13:03.870
Aah!

13:03.913 --> 13:05.523
We've done good work here,
gentlemen.

13:05.567 --> 13:08.135
ADULT ADAM: Barry's
jealous lesson was complete.

13:08.178 --> 13:10.920
But my Valentine war
with my dad
was just beginning.

13:10.964 --> 13:13.314
Murray, you keep on
surprising me.

13:13.357 --> 13:16.883
You got matchbooks from
all our favorite restaurants

13:16.926 --> 13:19.233
and framed them
in a piece of loving art?

13:19.276 --> 13:20.364
Framed what now?

13:20.408 --> 13:21.975
Wow, Dad!

13:22.018 --> 13:23.672
I never knew
you were capable

13:23.715 --> 13:25.805
of such an ambitious
romantic gesture.

13:25.848 --> 13:27.894
In fact,
it'd be wrong for me

13:27.937 --> 13:29.417
to steal
your special dinner.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.290
He's right, Mur.
We're back on!

13:33.334 --> 13:34.901
ADULT ADAM: After that
Valentine's ambush,

13:34.944 --> 13:36.641
it was my dad's
turn to strike.

13:36.685 --> 13:39.731
Schmoopie, mother-son
dance lessons?

13:39.775 --> 13:41.777
Wait, what?

13:41.821 --> 13:43.735
Oh, wow.

13:43.779 --> 13:46.216
Little Fred Astaire
even rented a tuxedo
for the occasion.

13:47.914 --> 13:49.437
Moonlight trail rides?

13:49.480 --> 13:50.655
Murray, you didn't.

13:50.699 --> 13:52.832
Seems like I did.

13:52.875 --> 13:56.183
Got your cowboy boots
from that trip to the dude
ranch that you hated.

13:56.226 --> 13:59.577
This is the best day
of my  life!

14:00.709 --> 14:02.232
You think this is over?

14:02.276 --> 14:04.974
I got two words for you,
whale watching.

14:05.018 --> 14:08.151
I see your whale watching
and raise you
a hot-air balloon ride.

14:08.195 --> 14:10.327
Tandem bike ride
in Martha's Vineyard.

14:10.371 --> 14:12.634
Apple picking
and making a pie.

14:12.677 --> 14:14.462
Antiquing in New England.

14:14.505 --> 14:15.724
Couples massage!

14:15.767 --> 14:18.031
Shakespeare in the park!
Swimming with dolphins!

14:18.074 --> 14:20.468
Rowboating at dusk!
Pasta-making class!

14:20.511 --> 14:22.252
Italian opera!

14:22.296 --> 14:25.516
Y'know,
you two fighting over me
has been so much fun,

14:25.560 --> 14:28.041
I've lost track
of who I'm going
to dinner with.

14:28.084 --> 14:28.955
Still deciding.
We'll letcha know.

14:28.998 --> 14:32.088
Ohh...

14:34.438 --> 14:36.049
ADULT ADAM: While my mom
was raking in the love,

14:36.092 --> 14:37.964
Geoff was
about to unleash fury.

14:38.007 --> 14:39.835
Yo, Dando.
Oh, what's up, Geoff?

14:39.879 --> 14:41.532
Oh, I'll tell you
what's up.

14:41.576 --> 14:44.144
It just so happens
that I don't like your
stupid, handsome face

14:44.187 --> 14:45.972
or your super-talented
guitar playing

14:46.015 --> 14:47.843
or your amazingly
luscious hair!

14:47.887 --> 14:49.192
What the hell
is happening right now?

14:49.236 --> 14:50.019
Geoff, a word.

14:50.846 --> 14:52.239
Love the energy,

14:52.282 --> 14:53.849
but your insults
are coming off
as compliments.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.372
Good note.
Here I go again.

14:55.416 --> 14:57.331
I'm a pretty intuitive
person.

14:57.374 --> 14:59.115
I'm getting a vibe
you got a problem with me.

14:59.159 --> 15:01.335
Oh-ho-ho!
Nothing gets past you

15:01.378 --> 15:03.424
and your super chill way
about you!

15:03.467 --> 15:05.165
And you're so nice!
I hate you!

15:05.208 --> 15:07.819
Okay,
this got weird fast.

15:07.863 --> 15:09.560
Maybe I'm just not
the right fit here.

15:09.604 --> 15:11.084
No, it's fine.
Couple of buddies

15:11.127 --> 15:12.128
from high school
are starting a band,

15:12.172 --> 15:13.956
so I'm just gonna
give that a shot.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.002
Good! Take your
optimistic attitude

15:16.045 --> 15:17.742
and your dumb-ass
box of Lemonheads

15:17.786 --> 15:18.918
and get the hell
out of here!

15:19.788 --> 15:20.963
Hey. Thanks, bro.

15:22.399 --> 15:23.923
What the hell
has gotten into you?

15:23.966 --> 15:25.446
I don't know,
but do you like it?

15:25.489 --> 15:26.577
Not even a little bit.

15:26.621 --> 15:28.449
Good.
I hate it, too!

15:28.492 --> 15:30.146
Barry got me all riled up
and convinced me

15:30.190 --> 15:32.061
you were gonna
leave me for Evan
'cause I'm nice.

15:32.105 --> 15:35.891
I'm a college dropout
with a band that rehearses
in her parents' basement.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.198
The only consistently
good thing
in my life is you.

15:38.241 --> 15:39.677
Oh, thank God.

15:39.721 --> 15:42.028
And you! Stop messing
with Geoff's head.

15:42.071 --> 15:43.246
You know it's all
oatmeal up there.

15:43.290 --> 15:45.335
Huh?
I was just trying to help.

15:45.379 --> 15:48.208
By convincing Geoff
that I'm gonna leave him?
How is that helpful?

15:48.251 --> 15:50.384
'Cause it happened to me!

15:50.427 --> 15:52.038
Lainey broke my heart,

15:52.081 --> 15:55.693
and there was no one there
to help or stop it or warn me.

15:55.737 --> 15:58.087
And the last thing I want
is for my best friend

15:58.131 --> 15:59.393
to end up lonely
and miserable like me.

16:01.351 --> 16:03.919
Don't just stand there!
Go after him
before he leaves forever!

16:03.963 --> 16:05.616
He's my brother.
He lives upstairs.

16:05.660 --> 16:07.488
No, I mean Evan!

16:07.531 --> 16:10.099
I love him!

16:10.143 --> 16:13.233
ADULT ADAM: With that,
Erica realized how hard
things had been for Barry.

16:13.276 --> 16:15.975
As for my mom, everything
was coming up roses.

16:16.018 --> 16:17.933
Well, hello,
Virginia Kremp.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.587
How's V-Day
treating ya?

16:19.630 --> 16:23.460
Well, as we say
in the flower game,
business is blooming.

16:23.504 --> 16:25.114
Shh. I'm in mid-brag.

16:25.158 --> 16:27.247
As you know,
my guys have showered me

16:27.290 --> 16:29.727
with expensive gifts
and ticket experiences.

16:29.771 --> 16:31.468
She's here, Charles!

16:31.512 --> 16:33.470
Bring in
the Valentine Explosion.

16:33.514 --> 16:37.605
It's so big and deserved!

16:37.648 --> 16:42.349
"Your devoted husband
and keeper of your heart,
Murray."

16:42.392 --> 16:44.481
Hmm, Murray. No, no,
I think that's a mistake.

16:44.525 --> 16:46.875
Um, Adam actually came in
and ordered that for you.

16:46.918 --> 16:48.746
Um, you're very wrong.

16:48.790 --> 16:50.618
Clearly,
it's from my husband.

16:50.661 --> 16:53.142
No, I took the order.
It was your son,

16:53.186 --> 16:55.101
the one who forces Chad
to act in his weird videos.

16:55.144 --> 16:58.539
Then why does it say it's from
my "devoted husband," Charles?

16:58.582 --> 17:01.846
Why does it say "Murray"
if Adam bought the flowers,
Charles?

17:01.890 --> 17:03.022
Why, Charles?

17:04.980 --> 17:06.851
One theory
is that they are

17:06.895 --> 17:10.203
trying to dish you off
on each other.

17:10.246 --> 17:13.206
The other theory is I should
keep my big, fat mouth closed.

17:13.249 --> 17:14.294
Okay.
I'm gonna go now. Bye.

17:15.904 --> 17:18.167
Murray! Adam!
We need to talk!

17:18.211 --> 17:19.647
Damn right we do.

17:19.690 --> 17:21.692
Look at what Dad gotcha!

17:21.736 --> 17:25.348
It's a bear,
and his shirt says,
"I love you Bevy much!"

17:25.392 --> 17:26.915
That's nothin'!

17:26.958 --> 17:30.136
Adam wants to take you
on a wine-tasting trip
to Martha's Vineyard!

17:30.179 --> 17:31.789
Okay, cut the poop!

17:31.833 --> 17:33.835
I know neither of you
want to go to dinner with me.

17:33.878 --> 17:35.489
Oh, boy.
I'm sorry!

17:35.532 --> 17:37.360
I just wanted
to be with Jackie.

17:37.404 --> 17:39.667
Don't be mad at me.
Well, I am mad.

17:39.710 --> 17:42.539
But I'm more mad
at your father,
so I'll yell at him first.

17:42.583 --> 17:44.280
I'll give you two
the privacy you deserve.

17:45.586 --> 17:47.327
Bevy, don't be angry.

17:47.370 --> 17:49.720
You... You know I'm not good
at feelings and stuff.

17:49.764 --> 17:51.374
Oh, I get it.

17:51.418 --> 17:54.464
I used to think
you just weren't
good at Valentine's Day.

17:54.508 --> 17:57.206
But turns out,
you're amazing...

17:57.250 --> 17:59.426
If it's to get out
of spending time with me.

17:59.469 --> 18:00.557
Just let me explain...

18:00.601 --> 18:01.950
Save it.

18:01.993 --> 18:03.821
You got what you wanted.

18:03.865 --> 18:05.475
Valentine's Day
without me.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.699
ADULT ADAM: My mom's
Valentine's Day was a bust.

18:11.742 --> 18:13.701
It was gonna take more than
chocolates to make it right.

18:14.702 --> 18:16.312
Hey.
Don't.

18:16.356 --> 18:17.966
Look, I know
a few stupid chocolates

18:18.009 --> 18:20.708
won't make up
for what I did,
but maybe this will.

18:20.751 --> 18:22.318
I borrowed
Adam's dumb camera,

18:22.362 --> 18:24.538
and I made you
a real Valentine's Day gift.

18:24.581 --> 18:26.496
And I helped!

18:26.540 --> 18:30.500
I was the cameraman,
and a pretty darn good one,
if I do say so myself.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.547
I don't know
if this is a good idea,

18:33.590 --> 18:34.765
just sitting here
and saying how I feel.

18:34.809 --> 18:36.550
POPS: Bev's not here.

18:36.593 --> 18:39.335
Just look in the lens
and speak from the heart.

18:39.379 --> 18:41.381
MURRAY: All right.
Let's do this.

18:41.424 --> 18:42.773
POPS: Now, where's
that damn button?

18:42.817 --> 18:45.994
That was
absolutely beautiful! Yeah?

18:46.037 --> 18:47.952
Yeah. I-I don't know. I think I could do it better.

18:47.996 --> 18:50.825
POPS: Three, two, one...

18:50.868 --> 18:52.653
Sweet Lord, Murray.

18:52.696 --> 18:55.612
I've never seen you cry like that.

18:55.656 --> 18:57.310
MURRAY:  I'm just getting in the groove.

18:57.353 --> 18:58.398
I think I got another one.
Let's do it.

18:58.441 --> 18:59.616
POPS: Okay. Go!

18:59.660 --> 19:01.662
I don't know. That one kind of got away from me.

19:01.705 --> 19:03.185
POPS: I don't know.
I kinda liked it.

19:03.229 --> 19:05.535
Damn it, Al!
You filmed it backwards!

19:05.579 --> 19:07.668
I pushed the button
like Adam does.

19:07.711 --> 19:09.757
It was off when it was
supposed to be on!

19:09.800 --> 19:11.672
Why would a red light
mean "On"?

19:11.715 --> 19:14.805
Red is the international
signal for "Stop"!

19:14.849 --> 19:17.025
That's with cars,
not with cameras!

19:17.068 --> 19:18.766
Oh, now you're
a camera expert!

19:18.809 --> 19:21.029
You don't need a tape.

19:21.072 --> 19:22.683
Just tell me
everything now.

19:22.726 --> 19:24.337
Right now?

19:24.380 --> 19:25.990
T-To your face?

19:26.034 --> 19:27.601
I-I can't do that!

19:27.644 --> 19:28.950
Please?

19:28.993 --> 19:30.604
Just tell her, Murray.

19:30.647 --> 19:31.822
Fine!

19:31.866 --> 19:33.868
I love you!

19:33.911 --> 19:37.393
A-And I hate that I live
in a constant panic,
afraid to tell you that.

19:37.437 --> 19:39.917
And I... I hate
that I can't express

19:39.961 --> 19:41.745
h-how much
you mean to me!

19:43.530 --> 19:45.445
You just did, Mur.

19:45.488 --> 19:47.838
I-I just said
that I love you.

19:51.102 --> 19:53.322
I know.

19:53.366 --> 19:54.671
ADULT ADAM:
My dad was the kind of guy

19:54.715 --> 19:57.761
who had a hard time saying
"I love you" out loud.

19:57.805 --> 20:01.330
But when he finally did,
it was all my mom
needed to hear.

20:01.374 --> 20:03.724
What do ya know.
The Terminator's funny.

20:03.767 --> 20:06.205
They don't look the same,
but it's clear they're family.

20:08.946 --> 20:12.167
♪ Walked along and on
until they couldn't

20:12.211 --> 20:15.388
ADULT ADAM:
And, as for Barry,
his Valentine's Day

20:15.431 --> 20:17.520
would end up being a bit sweeter than he thought.

20:17.564 --> 20:19.957
What's going on?
What does it look like?

20:20.001 --> 20:21.916
You've got a date
for Valentine's Day.

20:21.959 --> 20:24.484
I appreciate it,
but I just want
to be alone.

20:24.527 --> 20:26.268
But you're not.

20:26.312 --> 20:27.617
You've got us.
It's true.

20:27.661 --> 20:28.357
We're here for you, man.

20:29.576 --> 20:31.360
Listen, we actually know
a cool, new band

20:31.404 --> 20:32.622
we thought
you might want to see.

20:32.666 --> 20:35.103
♪ Stole a voice
to tell her that he wouldn't

20:35.146 --> 20:36.713
♪ He kinda, shoulda ♪

20:36.757 --> 20:38.149
ADULT ADAM:
Life is a funny thing.

20:38.193 --> 20:39.673
My best friend's cousin,

20:39.716 --> 20:41.327
who had the same
rock dreams as my sister,

20:41.370 --> 20:42.589
really ended up making it

20:42.632 --> 20:44.982
in a band
called The Lemonheads.

20:45.026 --> 20:47.594
And even though The Dropouts
didn't get quite as big,

20:47.637 --> 20:50.684
it didn't matter, 'cause when you're surrounded by the people you love,

20:50.727 --> 20:52.425
life is full of sweet music.

21:04.132 --> 21:07.004
Aww, Jackie, thanks again
for this awesome V-Day gift.

21:07.048 --> 21:09.137
Anytime you miss me,
all you gotta do is hit
"Play."

21:10.312 --> 21:11.748
COACH NICK'S VOICE:
Hey, Goldfarb!

21:11.792 --> 21:13.533
Since you don't listen to me
in gym class,

21:13.576 --> 21:15.317
maybe you'll listen
to your furry friend.

21:15.361 --> 21:18.712
Balls! Giant Coach Mellor
must've grabbed Teddy
when I wasn't looking.

21:18.755 --> 21:21.018
This isn't the school
fromFame,

21:21.062 --> 21:22.890
so put down your lightsaber
and focus on

21:22.933 --> 21:24.544
what's real important,
sports!

21:25.849 --> 21:26.546
Good form.
