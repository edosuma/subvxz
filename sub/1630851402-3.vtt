a seven-day state of emergency

00:12.280 --> 00:14.680
ahead of catastrophic
fire conditions...

00:14.680 --> 00:18.440
..experiencing temperatures
higher than 39 degrees.

00:27.520 --> 00:29.880

all over the state, and...

bearing down at the back door

We've spoken to the Weather Bureau,
and news is not looking good.

01:07.640 --> 01:11.320
The prediction for tomorrow is
an uncomfortable 40 degrees,

01:11.320 --> 01:14.240
with low humidity
and potential for high winds.

01:14.240 --> 01:17.840
Conditions are unpredictable,
to say the least.

01:17.840 --> 01:19.720
There's every possibility
of road closures,

01:19.720 --> 01:22.120
so unless you're staying to defend,
and like I said earlier,

01:22.120 --> 01:25.000
you need to be properly prepared
with the resources,

01:25.000 --> 01:27.480
skills and capacity to do so,

01:27.480 --> 01:30.120
our advice is that you should leave.

OK, OK.
Now, while you're all here,

01:40.920 --> 01:44.000
I want to give a shout out to
our amazing volunteer firefighters,

01:44.000 --> 01:48.120
who've given up work and family time
to protect the rest of us.

01:48.120 --> 01:50.080
Especially the crews from
interstate. Thanks, guys.

01:50.080 --> 01:53.160
Let's give 'em a round of applause.
That's right.

01:59.480 --> 02:04.200
Thanks, everyone. Keep your radios
on for updates at all times, please.

02:09.080 --> 02:11.080
You guys are legends,
doing what you do.

02:19.560 --> 02:20.560

02:20.560 --> 02:22.160

Excuse me.

on her way down from Sydney

02:25.000 --> 02:26.840

She should turn around.

It's not safe.

02:28.560 --> 02:30.240
Yep, turn around.

Yeah, thanks Mike, thank you.
Yeah, she'll be ready.

02:34.480 --> 02:36.800
Thanks, mate. Yeah,
see you soon. Bye.

02:36.800 --> 02:39.760
Great. So, Mike and Pete
are going to take you to your mum's.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.160
No way.
I don't want to go with them.

02:41.160 --> 02:42.160
They're creepy.

02:42.160 --> 02:43.600
They're not. They're lovely.

02:43.600 --> 02:46.720
You're going with Mike and Pete
and that's the end of the story.

02:46.720 --> 02:48.320
It's not safe for you here
if the road's closed.

02:48.320 --> 02:50.040
If it's not safe,
why are you staying?

She's carrying on again.
Does it every year.

03:06.800 --> 03:09.480
She's going on about having
an ethical Christmas or something,

03:09.480 --> 03:10.960
whatever that means.

03:10.960 --> 03:13.960
And all she wants is this
goat from Cambodia!

03:13.960 --> 03:16.840
What's she gonna do with a Cambodian
goat, for Christ's sake?

03:16.840 --> 03:19.120
So I got her soap.

03:19.120 --> 03:21.000
Which is also ethical.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.960
Cleanliness, Godliness and all that.

Here you go.

03:42.720 --> 03:45.560
I'll see you both on Monday, OK?

03:45.560 --> 03:49.160
Hey, Peter, is there any chance that
we could get a couple of extra doses

03:49.160 --> 03:50.840
just given the circumstances?

03:50.840 --> 03:52.520
That's the most I can do, sorry.

03:52.520 --> 03:53.920
I'll see you Monday.

they're gonna cut my shifts.

with anything?

14:37.960 --> 14:39.440
Yeah, yeah, please. Thanks.

14:39.440 --> 14:40.840
Should have left yesterday, mate.

14:40.840 --> 14:42.120
It's just...stupid.

14:42.120 --> 14:44.760
Yeah, me too. My friend, she was
supposed to give me a lift out

14:44.760 --> 14:46.360
but she left without me.

14:46.360 --> 14:47.920

straight to Canberra.

14:58.840 --> 14:59.960

14:59.960 --> 15:01.800
No detours, you know?
No, that's good for me.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.320
That's good for me.

15:03.320 --> 15:06.120
Um...you'd be really helping me out.

15:09.120 --> 15:10.120
I'm sorry.

15:13.960 --> 15:15.640
I don't know what else to do.

15:37.320 --> 15:39.360
I hope you're not a serial killer.

15:39.360 --> 15:42.040
Hey. Roi.

15:42.040 --> 15:44.000
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.840
I've been sitting here terrified.

15:45.840 --> 15:48.240
I'm not a serial killer.
Are you a serial killer?

No.

Oh, thank God.

15:53.320 --> 15:56.200
Joel, uh,
you got a family in Canberra?

15:56.200 --> 16:00.200
Yeah, my mum's there, yeah,
and my brother, yeah.

16:01.960 --> 16:05.720
Mum does a big family lunch
on Christmas Day.

16:05.720 --> 16:08.240
She's a really good cook, actually.

16:08.240 --> 16:09.520
My mum's a great cook as well.

16:09.520 --> 16:10.640
Yeah.

16:10.640 --> 16:12.640
She probably lit these fires

16:12.640 --> 16:15.120
to make sure we got back
for Christmas lunch.

16:15.120 --> 16:16.760

16:23.360 --> 16:24.960
Stop her stressing.

16:26.280 --> 16:28.920
How long till we get there,
do you think?

16:28.920 --> 16:31.840
Mm, maybe two and a half,
three hours.

16:31.840 --> 16:32.960
Something like that.

16:32.960 --> 16:34.280
OK. Yeah.

Did you wanna do a quiz?

16:48.520 --> 16:50.920
Oh, yes, Quiz Master.

16:50.920 --> 16:53.120
You want ME to be
the Quiz Master? OK.

Alright, you got your buzzer ready?
Mm-hm.

We're staying to defend.

17:37.040 --> 17:39.880
My partner's on his way back from
Canberra, so he should be here soon.

17:39.880 --> 17:41.920
You only have one access road
into your property.

17:41.920 --> 17:44.240
If you get into trouble,
we won't be able to get to you.

17:44.240 --> 17:45.240
We have a fire plan

17:45.240 --> 17:49.520

with the CFS recommendations.

17:51.760 --> 17:54.880
If you hear
the "shelter in place" warning,

17:54.880 --> 17:56.520
that means the fire's close.

17:57.880 --> 17:59.800
You won't be able to
leave by that point.

17:59.800 --> 18:01.880
And don't get into your car.
You won't be safe in your car.

18:01.880 --> 18:03.800

You say you know what to do
but you have no idea what it's like.

18:06.480 --> 18:08.960
The fire will hit,
then it will turn pitch black.

18:08.960 --> 18:10.360
You won't be able to see anything,

18:10.360 --> 18:13.040

because of the smoke and the noise.

caught when shit goes down.

Oh, great.
Thanks for letting us know.

51:03.520 --> 51:06.520
No problem.
My partner, Adrian, is staying.

51:06.520 --> 51:09.080
If you could keep his...
his name down.

51:11.800 --> 51:14.400
OK. Yeah, we will.
Thank you.

51:15.400 --> 51:17.080
Thanks for letting us know.

51:39.520 --> 51:42.240
You can stop if you want, Mott.

51:43.920 --> 51:46.120
Just make this your last rotation.

51:51.640 --> 51:52.960
Nah.

51:55.080 --> 51:56.800
I wanna keep going.

52:00.400 --> 52:01.720
OK.

52:03.520 --> 52:04.800
Yeah.

52:06.560 --> 52:08.480
(EXHALES HEAVILY)

52:11.000 --> 52:12.200
OK.

53:17.080 --> 53:18.120
Highway's closed.

53:18.120 --> 53:20.080
No-one's getting out till we get
the all clear, alright?

53:20.080 --> 53:22.480
MAN: Michelle McAullay,
Bungen's only claim to fame.

53:22.480 --> 53:23.480
You back for Christmas?

53:23.480 --> 53:24.800
Stuffed up my timing,
hey, Mr Finlay.

53:25.920 --> 53:28.480
Will Santa be able to find us
if we're not at home?

53:28.480 --> 53:30.040
They might have to bring me
my helicopter.

53:30.040 --> 53:31.160
Santa's coming!

53:31.160 --> 53:32.840
What'll happen
when they wake up in the morning

53:32.840 --> 53:34.400
and there's no Santa,
no presents, nothing?

53:34.400 --> 53:35.640
That's all the food we had!

53:35.640 --> 53:37.880
Where are you going? The fires are
still going on out there, yeah?

53:37.880 --> 53:39.800
I'm going to my place.
There's food and presents there.

53:40.720 --> 53:42.680
Well, go on.
Before I change my mind.

53:42.680 --> 53:44.200
We've got a problem.
We've lost some of them.

53:47.560 --> 53:49.080
I don't think we should be out here.

53:49.080 --> 53:50.480
There's still fires burning.

53:51.360 --> 53:53.000
(WHISTLE BLOWS URGENTLY)
Ethan!

53:54.400 --> 53:56.400
