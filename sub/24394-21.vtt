00:17.959 --> 00:19.458
Shane Smith:
This week on  Vice:

00:19.542 --> 00:22.750
the last-ditch effort
to fight climate change.

00:24.750 --> 00:27.000
Steve Oldham:
This is the world's
first recyclable fuel.

00:27.083 --> 00:29.000
It's compatible with any
vehicle in the world today.

00:29.083 --> 00:31.458
(Neukermans speaking)

00:34.041 --> 00:36.625
I hope that's not
any weird chemical, 'cause
I just put it in my mouth.

00:38.250 --> 00:40.041
(chuckling)
Okay, great.

00:40.125 --> 00:43.041
Leslie Field: The idea
is to try to rebuild
a natural system

00:43.125 --> 00:46.250
with the least
possible intervention
you possibly could.

00:46.333 --> 00:49.709
Jason Box:
We have started this era
of geoengineering.

00:49.792 --> 00:51.041
It's going to be a wild ride.

00:51.125 --> 00:52.792
(theme music playing)

00:55.667 --> 00:57.333
(crowd shouting)

00:57.417 --> 00:59.750
They're saying that right now,
it's time for change.

01:01.792 --> 01:03.458
(indistinct shouting)

01:15.417 --> 01:17.667
(helicopter blades whirring)

01:26.041 --> 01:29.250
Narrator:
Man is actually causing the
average temperature to rise

01:29.333 --> 01:31.709
two degrees per century.

01:31.792 --> 01:34.417
I am, today, committing
the United States of America,

01:34.500 --> 01:37.583
to develop an effective
and science-based response

01:37.667 --> 01:39.917
to the issue of global warming.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.083
Smith:
We've known
about climate change
for over 50 years.

01:43.166 --> 01:44.917
Our response
to the dire warnings

01:45.000 --> 01:46.709
has ranged from
too little too late,

01:46.792 --> 01:48.417
to outright denial.

01:48.500 --> 01:51.625
As a result, current
atmospheric carbon dioxide

01:51.709 --> 01:56.250
now exceeds levels
that haven't been seen
in three million years,

01:56.333 --> 01:59.458
long before
humans even existed.

01:59.542 --> 02:02.000
This is a "Holy Shit"
moment.

02:03.458 --> 02:06.000
Smith: It's worse
than holy shit.

02:06.083 --> 02:08.834
Vice has addressed
this important issue

02:08.917 --> 02:10.417
in all six of our seasons.

02:12.041 --> 02:13.834
However, what we have seen,

02:13.917 --> 02:16.291
is that instead of
comprehensively
addressing this crisis,

02:16.375 --> 02:18.625
humanity is going backwards.

02:18.709 --> 02:21.333
Trump:
The United States
will withdraw

02:21.417 --> 02:23.667
from the Paris...

02:25.000 --> 02:26.375
Climate Accord.

02:28.583 --> 02:30.000
Smith:
Many scientists believe

02:30.083 --> 02:32.792
that we have gone past
the point of no return,

02:32.875 --> 02:36.625
and as such, need to focus
on much more radical ideas.

02:36.709 --> 02:39.417
So, in this episode,
we are gonna look
at potential solutions

02:39.500 --> 02:42.542
that could possibly steer us
back from the brink.

02:57.792 --> 02:59.291
(Jason Box speaking)

03:16.208 --> 03:17.458
So, we're here
in southern Greenland,

03:17.542 --> 03:19.208
at what used to be
called Eagle Glacier,

03:19.291 --> 03:20.792
so-called because
it looked like an eagle,

03:20.875 --> 03:23.166
with two wings and a--
and a neck and a head.

03:23.250 --> 03:25.959
The neck and the head
were here, melted.

03:26.041 --> 03:29.458
That whole wing is melted
since we last came here.

03:31.333 --> 03:34.250
This part of southern
Greenland is losing ice

03:34.333 --> 03:35.917
faster than anywhere else
in Greenland,

03:36.000 --> 03:38.917
in fact, as fast as
anywhere on Earth.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.667
It's losing ice so fast,

03:41.750 --> 03:45.291
that it's about three
trillion tons in a decade.

03:46.750 --> 03:49.500
The coastal environment,
you know,

03:49.583 --> 03:52.834
it's already just beginning
to be a problem.

03:55.291 --> 03:59.417
Sandy was a good example
of high-tide plus storm surge,

03:59.500 --> 04:01.375
plus sea-level rise,

04:01.458 --> 04:04.709
then flooding
in the New York subway,
costing $60 billion...

04:04.792 --> 04:06.208
-(snaps fingers)
-...like that.

04:06.291 --> 04:08.041
So, we'll see more of those
type of extreme events.

04:08.125 --> 04:09.875
We're fucked.

04:09.959 --> 04:12.041
(chuckles)
Yeah, yeah.

04:12.125 --> 04:14.417
So even halting emissions now,

04:14.500 --> 04:18.208
we still have this
problem of 50 percent

04:18.291 --> 04:20.250
too much CO2
in the atmosphere.

04:20.333 --> 04:22.750
Plan A,
which was conservation,

04:22.834 --> 04:24.250
has largely failed.

04:24.333 --> 04:25.750
So, Plan B,

04:25.834 --> 04:28.875
geoengineering,
needs to be Plan A,
it seems.

04:28.959 --> 04:31.792
We have to try
everything at this stage,

04:31.875 --> 04:34.291
because we're
in such deep shit.

04:34.375 --> 04:36.417
Can we dial
the thermostat?

04:36.500 --> 04:37.458
Smith:
Right.

04:37.542 --> 04:39.375
Can we, technologically,

04:39.458 --> 04:42.250
grab hold of this car that's
spinning out of control,

04:42.333 --> 04:44.291
and-- and start driving
in the right direction.

04:45.333 --> 04:47.709
Smith:
To find out what's being done
to actually fix the planet,

04:47.792 --> 04:49.583
we spoke to David Keith,

04:49.667 --> 04:52.000
the Harvard scientist
who's leading global
research efforts

04:52.083 --> 04:53.959
in geoengineering,

04:54.041 --> 04:58.333
or the use of technology
to rein in the planet's
rising temperatures.

04:58.417 --> 05:01.250
The world is facing
a huge crisis

05:01.333 --> 05:05.166
in climate change,
global warming,
sea-level rise.

05:05.250 --> 05:09.291
What is the fastest
these solutions
could be implemented?

05:09.375 --> 05:12.750
So, one of the things
that's scary about
solar geo is there's--

05:12.834 --> 05:14.625
it could be done
in dumb ways now.

05:14.709 --> 05:17.125
-Right.
-So the basic idea
isn't new at all.

05:17.208 --> 05:19.458
The very first report
that went to,

05:19.542 --> 05:21.625
sort of, the most powerful
decision maker in the world,

05:21.709 --> 05:24.417
on climate change,
went to President Johnson

05:24.500 --> 05:26.458
in 1965, when I was
two years old.

05:26.542 --> 05:29.291
-Wow.
-So that was the first
really good climate report.

05:29.375 --> 05:31.291
And that report included,

05:31.375 --> 05:34.041
as one of the few things
that was suggested to
deal with the problem,

05:34.125 --> 05:36.166
what we could now call
solar geoengineering,

05:36.250 --> 05:37.625
-a variant of it.
-  Smith:  Yeah.

05:37.709 --> 05:39.500
Keith:
So these ideas
aren't new at all,

05:39.583 --> 05:42.500
and the basic ability has
been around for a long time.

05:42.583 --> 05:45.000
So, it typically means
two really different things

05:45.083 --> 05:47.000
that actually don't have
much to do with each other.

05:47.083 --> 05:50.333
So one of them is the idea
that we might take CO2
out of the atmosphere,

05:50.417 --> 05:53.542
or otherwise,
kind of accelerate
natural syncs for CO.

05:53.625 --> 05:55.667
So taking carbon
out of the atmosphere.

05:55.750 --> 05:57.166
That's correct.
So, the second part is,

05:57.250 --> 05:58.792
solar geoengineering,

05:58.875 --> 06:01.500
which is the idea that
humanity might deliberately

06:01.583 --> 06:03.458
make the Earth a litte
more reflective

06:03.542 --> 06:07.250
to reduce some of the risks
of the accumulated
carbon dioxide.

06:08.625 --> 06:11.041
Smith:
To battle these rising
carbon dioxide levels,

06:11.125 --> 06:13.375
groundbreaking technologies
are being developed

06:13.458 --> 06:15.709
to cool down the Earth
and slow sea-level rise

06:15.792 --> 06:17.709
by removing carbon
from the atmosphere,

06:17.792 --> 06:19.417
brightening clouds,

06:19.500 --> 06:22.041
and even replicating
volcanic eruptions

06:22.125 --> 06:24.583
to reflect sunlight
away from the planet.

06:26.125 --> 06:28.041
And in one experimental
site in the Arctic,

06:28.125 --> 06:31.709
a scientific team
is focusing their work
on the ice itself.

06:31.792 --> 06:36.125
So we sent Ben Anderson
to Alaska's
northern-most town.

06:43.959 --> 06:46.208
Leslie Field:
This is hollow glass
microspheres.

06:46.291 --> 06:48.917
You can think of it as
a form of floating sand.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.375
It's reflective, it's bright.

06:50.458 --> 06:54.000
It's basically
a thin, silica shell

06:54.083 --> 06:56.208
around a gas core.

06:56.291 --> 06:59.250
I mean, a lot of these things,
seem to be about
damage limitation.

06:59.333 --> 07:01.250
-But this is actually
about boosting--
-Yeah, we're--

07:01.333 --> 07:04.041
We're working
on Arctic restoration.

07:04.125 --> 07:08.250
People are attributing
a quarter to a half of
global temperature rise

07:08.333 --> 07:10.208
every year, right now,

07:10.291 --> 07:13.917
is coming from the loss
of that reflective heat shield
in the Arctic.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.917
We-- we want to build that back
to be the Earth's heat shield,

07:17.000 --> 07:18.500
the Earth's refrigerator.

07:26.500 --> 07:28.750
Smith:
The idea is
surprisingly simple:

07:28.834 --> 07:30.709
cover the ice
with reflective sand

07:30.792 --> 07:33.083
to reduce the amount
of sunlight absorbed.

07:33.166 --> 07:36.083
The team is testing
the concept
on a small scale

07:36.166 --> 07:38.125
on a nearby frozen lake.

07:40.417 --> 07:43.291
(wind blowing)

07:43.375 --> 07:44.542
Man:
Oh, shit.

07:49.917 --> 07:51.458
Anderson:
Based on what
you've done so far,

07:51.542 --> 07:54.083
this area will be covered
with your reflective sand.

07:54.166 --> 07:56.500
Roughly, how much longer
will the ice last?

07:56.583 --> 07:58.458
The prediction is days.

07:58.542 --> 08:01.000
Uh, and-- and that
matters on this scale.

08:01.083 --> 08:04.125
Smith:
The long-term goal is
to scale up the process

08:04.208 --> 08:06.083
and pinpoint the areas
in the Arctic

08:06.166 --> 08:08.125
where it will have
the greatest effect.

08:08.208 --> 08:11.959
We're looking at areas on
the order of half a percent
of the Arctic.

08:12.041 --> 08:15.000
By building that back,

08:15.083 --> 08:18.959
you stop this inevitable
heating feedback loop

08:19.041 --> 08:20.792
of getting things
hotter and hotter

08:20.875 --> 08:22.500
and sea levels rising,

08:22.583 --> 08:24.458
um, destabilizing
the jet stream,

08:24.542 --> 08:26.625
and having more
severe storms and such.

08:28.375 --> 08:31.834
Rebuilding ice would be
easier on the wildlife,

08:31.917 --> 08:33.667
would be easier
on the planet.

08:33.750 --> 08:35.834
It's just-- it's one
of the safest things
we can think of

08:35.917 --> 08:38.208
to be able to turn back
to where we were.

08:38.291 --> 08:42.166
The idea is to try to
rebuild a natural system

08:42.250 --> 08:45.000
with the least
possible intervention
you can possibly make.

08:45.083 --> 08:47.166
We really have to
preserve the Arctic.

08:47.250 --> 08:50.542
There's no option there,
and we have to proceed
with all due speed on

08:50.625 --> 08:53.458
all these other
mitigation techniques
that people are using,

08:53.542 --> 08:55.208
I mean, this is just-- it's key.

08:55.291 --> 08:57.333
It's absolutely essential.
They have to work together.

08:57.417 --> 09:00.458
Smith: One of
the mitigation techniques
that Dr. Field mentions

09:00.542 --> 09:03.542
is currently being researched
in Silicon Valley

09:03.625 --> 09:06.208
by a team of retired
engineers and entrepreneurs.

09:06.291 --> 09:09.083
Their goal is to develop
a technology

09:09.166 --> 09:12.500
that can be quickly applied
to kick sunlight away
from the Earth,

09:12.583 --> 09:14.542
and thereby, cool the planet.

09:14.625 --> 09:17.709
These are all my
partners in crime,
so to speak.

09:17.792 --> 09:20.917
Okay! This is
the Dream Team,
here.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.291
This is the Dream Team,
a sort of a geriatric team.

09:24.750 --> 09:27.041
Jack Foster:
We've been doing this
for almost ten years,

09:27.125 --> 09:28.875
and the pay is
really good. Zero!

09:28.959 --> 09:31.083
(laughing)

09:31.166 --> 09:33.834
Smith:
Almost like something
out of a Hollywood film,

09:33.917 --> 09:36.375
Armand Neukermans
and his unconventional team

09:36.458 --> 09:38.250
of engineers
and entrepreneurs

09:38.333 --> 09:41.500
resemble the cast of a
real-life  Space Cowboys

09:41.583 --> 09:42.875
and have actually
banded together

09:42.959 --> 09:44.792
using the seed money
from Bill Gates

09:44.875 --> 09:46.417
and their own
personal savings

09:46.500 --> 09:48.625
to study and develop
a technology

09:48.709 --> 09:50.709
that could actually
brighten clouds.

09:50.792 --> 09:53.583
So why, if you guys
are all successful

09:53.667 --> 09:56.542
ex-inventors
and entrepreneurs,

09:56.625 --> 09:58.208
why work for free on this?

09:58.291 --> 10:01.792
-We're trying to get
an insurance policy.
-Smith: Right.

10:01.875 --> 10:03.417
So if things get really bad,

10:03.500 --> 10:06.208
we're gonna need
to have go-tos,

10:06.291 --> 10:08.208
and this is maybe,
potentially,
one of the go-tos.

10:08.291 --> 10:11.750
-That's right.
-If we don't have to do it,
it means, we've gone so far,

10:11.834 --> 10:14.417
that we're gonna try anything.

10:14.500 --> 10:17.208
Smith:
It's a geoengineering
technology

10:17.291 --> 10:19.041
called "marine
cloud brightening,"

10:19.125 --> 10:22.792
a process that
uses saltwater spray
to whiten clouds.

10:22.875 --> 10:25.583
Why are we trying
to brighten them
in the first place?

10:25.667 --> 10:27.083
-This is how clouds form.
-Yeah.

10:27.166 --> 10:29.959
What we're doing is trying
to enhance that process.

10:30.041 --> 10:32.625
About a quarter of the ocean
has clouds on it.

10:32.709 --> 10:34.625
Take about
30 or 40 percent of that

10:34.709 --> 10:36.917
and you get that
five percent enhanced,

10:37.000 --> 10:39.333
you would reflect
enough sunlight

10:39.417 --> 10:43.125
to almost compensate
for doubling of CO2.

10:43.208 --> 10:46.083
Smith:
The key to their technology
is the spray.

10:46.166 --> 10:48.250
For the effect
to work optimally,

10:48.333 --> 10:52.000
they need to spray trillions
of microscopic salt particles
every second.

10:53.417 --> 10:54.959
There we go.

10:55.041 --> 10:57.250
(Neukermans speaking)

11:08.750 --> 11:11.875
I hope that's not
any weird chemical 'cause
I just put it in my mouth.

11:13.792 --> 11:15.667
-(chuckling) Okay, great.
-All right.

11:15.750 --> 11:18.333
Smith:
Now what's ingenious
about this plan,

11:18.417 --> 11:21.333
is that the salt sprayers can
be deployed on cargo ships

11:21.417 --> 11:23.417
already crossing our oceans.

11:24.750 --> 11:27.125
So why do you believe that
this technology's gonna work?

11:27.208 --> 11:30.000
So, there's good evidence
that it might work
from ship tracks.

11:30.083 --> 11:33.333
So ships make a track,
like a cloud track?

11:33.417 --> 11:34.834
So, along the wind, you know,

11:34.917 --> 11:36.792
the wind blows
in a certain direction,

11:36.875 --> 11:38.375
and those are the--

11:38.458 --> 11:39.875
the hydroscopic particles

11:39.959 --> 11:41.875
and they make clouds just
like these other ones do

11:41.959 --> 11:43.125
if the conditions are there.

11:43.208 --> 11:44.709
Man:
If you look carefully,

11:44.792 --> 11:46.875
even where there
are already clouds,

11:46.959 --> 11:48.792
they're actually whiter, again,
because of a ship track
going underneath them.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.917
Like over here and over here.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.834
Smith:
So it's the same as when
you see a line from a plane,

11:54.917 --> 11:56.375
there's a line from each ship.

11:56.458 --> 11:57.667
That's-- Wow,
I didn't know that.

11:57.750 --> 12:00.250
So you guys say,
"Let's replace the bad

12:00.333 --> 12:02.208
-with the good,"
and brighten them up.
-Yeah, that's right.

12:02.291 --> 12:04.917
Neukermans:
We'll just take seawater
and spray seawater.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.208
Smith:
Essentially, ships
would be outfitted

12:07.291 --> 12:09.041
with a specially
designed nozzle

12:09.125 --> 12:11.583
that can spray
highly condensed
ocean saltwater,

12:11.667 --> 12:13.375
to brighten the clouds

12:13.458 --> 12:16.333
and better reflect
solar radiation
away from the Earth.

12:18.417 --> 12:21.583
I'm doing it, because I really
can't think of anything better

12:21.667 --> 12:23.166
I could be spending my time on.

12:23.250 --> 12:25.834
-I have a kid
in private college.
-Smith: Yeah.

12:25.917 --> 12:27.208
You know, because
I want to ensure

12:27.291 --> 12:29.709
-the best possible
future for him.
-Right.

12:29.792 --> 12:32.417
But if we're, you know,
gonna warm up this planet,

12:32.500 --> 12:34.458
he has, virtually, no future.

12:34.542 --> 12:36.333
That's a good answer

12:37.917 --> 12:40.375
Smith: Now, marine cloud
brightening is a very promising
technology,

12:40.458 --> 12:42.583
but it may not be
enough on its own.

12:42.667 --> 12:45.125
(rumbling)

12:45.208 --> 12:47.959
Simultaneously, another team
is studying volcanoes

12:48.041 --> 12:50.750
and their abilities to
actually darken our skies

12:50.834 --> 12:53.333
and thereby cool the planet.

12:56.208 --> 12:58.583
At one of the most
active volcanoes on Earth,

12:58.667 --> 13:00.583
Guatemala's Volcán de Fuego,

13:00.667 --> 13:03.250
scientists are studying
how ash cloud particles

13:03.333 --> 13:05.250
can effect
global temperatures.

13:05.333 --> 13:07.917
So we visited with
volcanologist Matt Watson,

13:08.000 --> 13:10.792
during the months
before its devastating
eruption this summer

13:10.875 --> 13:13.291
which killed more
than 160 people.

13:13.375 --> 13:15.583
(indistinct shouting)

13:15.667 --> 13:18.500
In 1991,
Mount Pinatubo erupted.

13:18.583 --> 13:21.291
It was the largest eruption
of the 20th century,

13:21.375 --> 13:23.625
and it had a profound
impact on climate.

13:23.709 --> 13:26.125
We saw a drop in temperature
around about half a degree.

13:26.208 --> 13:28.834
We see a drop
in global temperature

13:28.917 --> 13:30.917
after large eruptions,

13:31.000 --> 13:33.959
and that-- that's because
sulfur dioxide is ejected

13:34.041 --> 13:36.125
by volcanoes
into the atmosphere,

13:36.208 --> 13:38.500
that converts into
sulfate aerosol,

13:38.583 --> 13:39.959
which act like
tiny, little mirrors,

13:40.041 --> 13:42.500
and scatter incoming
solar radiation

13:42.583 --> 13:43.959
back out into space.

13:44.041 --> 13:46.291
That has the effect
of cooling the planet.

13:46.375 --> 13:48.458
I'm really interested
in volcanoes as analogs

13:48.542 --> 13:51.125
for deliberate intervention
into the climate system.

13:51.208 --> 13:53.291
It's climate control, right?

13:53.375 --> 13:56.458
It's changing the way the
global climate system works,

13:56.542 --> 13:59.333
to try and reduce
the worst impacts
of climate change.

13:59.417 --> 14:01.875
Smith:
Scientists are now studying

14:01.959 --> 14:05.125
how the deliberate introduction
of sulfur into the atmosphere

14:05.208 --> 14:08.500
would mimic the cooling
effect of volcanic ash.

14:08.583 --> 14:11.291
(Watson speaking)

14:11.375 --> 14:13.000
(man speaks)

14:13.083 --> 14:15.792
Watson:
We're about to fly
a drone into an ash cloud.

14:15.875 --> 14:17.125
And the reason
we want to do that

14:17.208 --> 14:20.166
is because we want
to collect particles

14:20.250 --> 14:22.625
that segue into
climate engineering,

14:22.709 --> 14:24.875
particularly solar
geoengineering,
is two-fold.

14:24.959 --> 14:26.709
Firstly, we need to know,

14:26.792 --> 14:29.792
and understand and control
the size very well.

14:29.875 --> 14:32.875
If the particles get too large,
we might actually induce
the opposite effect

14:32.959 --> 14:34.625
and end up warming the planet.

14:34.709 --> 14:36.709
And secondly,
I'm pretty confident to say

14:36.792 --> 14:39.208
that if we were ever
to do this for real,

14:39.291 --> 14:41.000
we'd need to monitor it
very, very carefully.

14:42.625 --> 14:44.709
All right. Clearance is
one kilometer above Fuego.

14:44.792 --> 14:46.542
Um, we're going up
to the height of Fuego.

14:46.625 --> 14:47.792
Watson:
Ready?

14:50.834 --> 14:53.625
(man on radio)

14:54.667 --> 14:56.166
(buzzing)

14:58.417 --> 15:00.250
Smith:
Particles collected
by the drone

15:00.333 --> 15:03.083
will be studied to better
understand volcanic aerosols

15:03.166 --> 15:06.041
and how to replicate
their cooling effect.

15:06.125 --> 15:07.375
Man:
The drone is about-- gonna be

15:07.458 --> 15:09.458
about the same
elevation as the top.

15:11.792 --> 15:13.125
-It's coming round.
-It is! Yeah.

15:14.917 --> 15:17.125
Man: Okay, we're coming
towards the top of
the clouds now. Over.

15:24.041 --> 15:27.834
Should be almost coming
over to you at this point. Over.

15:29.333 --> 15:32.375
Smith:
Geoengineering, using
volcanic-like particles,

15:32.458 --> 15:34.750
could successfully lower
the planet's temperatures,

15:34.834 --> 15:37.125
but it also carries
the serious potential

15:37.208 --> 15:39.792
for harming crop production
across the world.

15:41.166 --> 15:43.542
This stuff is so terrifying.

15:43.625 --> 15:46.542
It's such a big, scary idea.

15:46.625 --> 15:48.917
We have to be really honest

15:49.000 --> 15:50.750
about the pros
and cons of this stuff,

15:50.834 --> 15:54.166
because there are
nine billion lives
at stake, right?

15:55.166 --> 15:56.542
Smith:
In order to get
a better idea

15:56.625 --> 15:58.250
of the potentially
dangerous side effects

15:58.333 --> 15:59.792
of mimicking volcanoes,

15:59.875 --> 16:02.250
scientists are now
finalizing plans

16:02.333 --> 16:05.542
to spray sulfur particles
from a high-altitude balloon.

16:06.417 --> 16:08.333
What do you think
that the public's reaction?

16:08.417 --> 16:10.750
Because I just--
before you're even doing this,

16:10.834 --> 16:13.917
there's conspiracy theories
about chemtrails
and all of these things.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.458
We've examined all the
Twitter tweet-tweets ever,

16:17.542 --> 16:18.792
Uh, there's a way to do that.

16:18.875 --> 16:20.458
Most of the tweets that
have anything to do

16:20.542 --> 16:21.917
with geoengineering
are about chemtrails.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.750
-Wow!
-Yes!

16:23.834 --> 16:25.667
I mean, as a scientist,
I don't know what to react,
it's nuts.

16:25.750 --> 16:27.792
But as a citizen,
I worry about our ability

16:27.875 --> 16:30.166
to make any
sensible decisions

16:30.250 --> 16:31.917
if a significant fraction
of people believe stuff,

16:32.000 --> 16:34.458
which are just, kinda,
obviously false.

16:34.542 --> 16:36.834
To go back to the realm
of the sane.

16:36.917 --> 16:39.792
We've talked about
the solar reflection.

16:39.875 --> 16:43.000
Bring us-- Like, there's so much
carbon in the atmosphere,

16:43.083 --> 16:44.333
how do we even
make a dent?

16:44.417 --> 16:45.834
How do we scale that up?

16:45.917 --> 16:48.834
How do we-- how do we take
enough out to make it count?

16:48.917 --> 16:52.333
Removing all the carbon
from the atmosphere
is inherently hard

16:52.417 --> 16:54.834
'cause you actually have
to deal with all that material.

16:54.917 --> 16:56.667
I helped to form a start-up

16:56.750 --> 16:58.834
that has an
industrial technology
for removing CO2 from the air,

16:58.917 --> 17:01.000
and we have fought
like crazy

17:01.083 --> 17:03.166
to find industrially
scalable ways

17:03.250 --> 17:04.792
that are cheap to do that.

17:04.875 --> 17:08.542
Our market is capturing CO2
to combine it with hydrogen

17:08.625 --> 17:10.333
that comes from
cheap solar power

17:10.417 --> 17:11.709
to make transportation fuels--

17:11.792 --> 17:15.417
say to energize aircraft
in a carbon-neutral way.

17:16.417 --> 17:18.500
Smith:
Now, in a case
of tragic timing,

17:18.583 --> 17:22.291
just as we arrived to go
see this prototype plan
for carbon recapture,

17:22.375 --> 17:25.667
a state of emergency
had been declared
in British Columbia,

17:25.750 --> 17:29.041
with nearly 600 forest fires
raging out of control,

17:29.125 --> 17:32.792
thereby releasing
massive amounts of carbon
into the atmosphere.

17:37.166 --> 17:40.250
So this is our plant.
Great to have you here.

17:40.333 --> 17:42.208
-This land where
we're at here in Squamish...
-Yeah.

17:42.291 --> 17:44.208
...it's a great example of
climate change at work.

17:44.291 --> 17:45.875
This is a development site.

17:45.959 --> 17:47.375
We're building
lots of houses here
and industry.

17:47.458 --> 17:49.542
But they're having
to raise the land

17:49.625 --> 17:51.208
by about two meters,

17:51.291 --> 17:54.375
-because of the concern
about rising sea levels.
-Right.

17:54.458 --> 17:58.333
Meanwhile, we look around,
and we got 600 forest fires
in BC right now.

17:58.417 --> 18:00.417
So we can't see the mountains
because of the smoke.

18:02.417 --> 18:04.083
So all of this is smoke
from forest fires?

18:04.166 --> 18:05.667
Yeah. 600 in BC.

18:08.333 --> 18:10.542
Oldham:
Everything here
is a working mode,

18:10.625 --> 18:12.083
-full process working.
-Right.

18:12.166 --> 18:14.375
Think of it as, like,
a big cooling tower.

18:14.458 --> 18:17.750
Large fan, the fan
draws the CO2 in.

18:17.834 --> 18:20.291
Chemical reaction,
and we capture the CO.

18:20.375 --> 18:22.375
Wouldn't there be
more carbon to capture

18:22.458 --> 18:24.750
by dirty,
naughty factories?

18:24.834 --> 18:26.750
No, it's uniformly distributed.

18:26.834 --> 18:29.542
Yeah, so we could
put one of these plants
in the middle of Beijing,

18:29.625 --> 18:31.417
or we could
put it in the middle
of the Sahara Desert,

18:31.500 --> 18:34.041
you would capture
the same amount
of atmospheric CO2.

18:34.125 --> 18:36.291
So, we as a species,
have put it in,

18:36.375 --> 18:38.250
so we, as a species,
should be taking it out.

18:38.333 --> 18:39.917
Well, that's our choice,
but I think we have to,

18:40.000 --> 18:41.709
-or find somewhere
else to live.
-(chuckles): Right.

18:41.792 --> 18:45.875
And so, it's basically,
we recycle plastic,
we recycle paper,

18:45.959 --> 18:48.917
we recycle wood,
why don't we recycle energy?

18:49.000 --> 18:50.291
You're hitting the nail
on the head.

18:50.375 --> 18:52.625
We would like people
to be recycling their fuel

18:52.709 --> 18:55.291
in the same way as
they recycle other things.

18:55.375 --> 18:58.834
Smith: Your technology is,
we're gonna refine
that energy,

18:58.917 --> 19:01.083
that carbon out
of the atmosphere,

19:01.166 --> 19:03.750
combine it with
hydrogen and water,

19:03.834 --> 19:06.250
and then that's the same
as gas or jet fuel?

19:06.333 --> 19:09.083
Oldham:
Yeah. Yeah,
it's chemically the same.

19:09.166 --> 19:12.625
No pollutants.
So, for example, our diesel
burns completely clean.

19:12.709 --> 19:15.125
None of that black smoke
you see from trucks
when they go up hills.

19:15.208 --> 19:18.041
-Right.
-Completely clean, but yet,
it's chemically identical.

19:21.208 --> 19:22.417
Oldham:
Got a sample here.

19:22.500 --> 19:25.333
This is the world's first
recyclable fuel.

19:25.417 --> 19:26.667
And here's the
interesting thing.

19:26.750 --> 19:28.208
A carbon-neutral fuel
that's compatible

19:28.291 --> 19:30.041
with any vehicle
in the world today.

19:30.125 --> 19:31.166
Right.

19:31.250 --> 19:32.667
So that car
you just drove up in?

19:32.750 --> 19:34.792
-We can make that
carbon neutral tomorrow.
-Wow.

19:34.875 --> 19:36.166
Any vehicle,

19:36.250 --> 19:38.875
any performance vehicle,
any battered old truck,

19:38.959 --> 19:40.000
airplanes,

19:40.083 --> 19:41.291
we're compatible
with all of those.

19:41.375 --> 19:42.500
Which is significant,

19:42.583 --> 19:44.208
because nobody's
making electric tractors,

19:44.291 --> 19:45.542
-or electric planes.
-Right.

19:45.625 --> 19:47.458
Do you have to do
any modifications?

19:47.542 --> 19:48.875
-No.
-Wow!

19:48.959 --> 19:51.834
If we recycle all the plastic
out of the oceans,

19:51.917 --> 19:54.667
we'd never actually have
to produce anymore plastic

19:54.750 --> 19:57.500
because there's already
enough plastic out there
to continue anew.

19:57.583 --> 19:59.458
So there's enough carbon
in the atmosphere,

19:59.542 --> 20:01.208
that we could just
continually make...

20:01.291 --> 20:04.834
uh, uh,
synthetic fuel like this

20:04.917 --> 20:06.875
-to power our cars?
-Yes, you could.

20:06.959 --> 20:09.834
This is the real--
the killer app
for what we're doing.

20:09.917 --> 20:13.250
So transportation is about
20 percent of the CO2 emissions.

20:13.333 --> 20:15.041
How are we gonna
decarbonize that?

20:15.125 --> 20:17.333
There's a billion cars
in the world.

20:17.417 --> 20:20.041
So if we all go electric,

20:20.125 --> 20:21.875
$50,000 for an electric car,

20:21.959 --> 20:23.750
that's $50 trillion.

20:23.834 --> 20:27.333
Then you've got to deliver
energy and electricity
to each car.

20:27.417 --> 20:28.875
-It's a massive change.
-Yeah.

20:28.959 --> 20:31.917
Alternatively, why don't
we just change the fuel?

20:32.000 --> 20:34.625
The price to you at the pump
will be the same.

20:35.792 --> 20:37.375
Smith:
Cars powered by this fuel

20:37.458 --> 20:39.875
would still release some
carbon into the atmosphere,

20:39.959 --> 20:42.709
but at least they'd be
releasing recycled carbon

20:42.792 --> 20:44.875
that could be captured again.

20:44.959 --> 20:48.875
Having something like
a carbon-neutral gas
isn't even enough.

20:48.959 --> 20:50.667
We've got to start
going negative.

20:50.750 --> 20:54.375
We've got to
actually pull carbon
out of the atmosphere.

20:54.458 --> 20:57.709
Now, can-- can this do that,
and what's the plan there?

20:57.792 --> 21:00.709
Yeah, absolutely.
We can take the CO2
generated here,

21:00.792 --> 21:01.875
and bury that underground

21:01.959 --> 21:03.542
and you get to
negative emissions.

21:03.625 --> 21:05.917
-Right.
-It's a hugely important thing.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.583
And how many
do you need to scale it
to get to carbon negative?

21:08.667 --> 21:10.208
Oldham:
You need less of these

21:10.291 --> 21:12.875
than there are power stations
in the world today

21:12.959 --> 21:14.792
to net emissions out to zero.

21:14.875 --> 21:16.959
And how--
so how many is that?

21:17.041 --> 21:18.875
It's in the region
of tens of thousands.

21:18.959 --> 21:22.625
If we are taking measures
as we should be,
to move emissions elsewhere,

21:22.709 --> 21:25.959
now you start getting
to an overall negative
emissions for the world.

21:26.041 --> 21:29.208
Why isn't the world
rushing to Squamish, BC,

21:29.291 --> 21:32.583
and saying, "Can we please
make 100,000 of these?"

21:32.667 --> 21:35.417
-So, first of all, we're open
and ready to receive the world.
-Yeah.

21:35.500 --> 21:37.750
Um, secondly,
we've really just got

21:37.834 --> 21:40.500
to proof of concept here,
and it's working.

21:40.583 --> 21:43.333
So the next step of our business
is to expand across the globe...

21:43.417 --> 21:45.291
-Smith: Scale.
-...make carbon-neutral fuel,

21:45.375 --> 21:46.792
and when the scientists
and the governments

21:46.875 --> 21:49.458
decide that they need
to do negative emissions,

21:49.542 --> 21:51.166
the technology's ready.

21:52.208 --> 21:54.792
Smith:
Now, obviously creating
a carbon-neutral fuel

21:54.875 --> 21:57.792
made by refining it out of
pre-existing greenhouse gasses

21:57.875 --> 21:59.959
would be a positive first step,

22:00.041 --> 22:02.417
however there is so much
carbon in the atmosphere,

22:02.500 --> 22:04.625
that we need to get
to negative emissions,

22:04.709 --> 22:06.250
effectively going backwards,

22:06.333 --> 22:08.291
and reversing the
greenhouse effects

22:08.375 --> 22:10.166
and actually cooling down
the planet

22:10.250 --> 22:12.625
by removing more CO2
than we're adding

22:12.709 --> 22:16.834
and sequestering the
excess carbon underground.

22:16.917 --> 22:18.875
Now, while these
technologies are promising,

22:18.959 --> 22:21.000
and give us hope
for a brighter future,

22:21.083 --> 22:23.166
all human innovation, it seems,

22:23.250 --> 22:25.500
come with unintended
consequences.

22:25.583 --> 22:29.166
There could also
be a negative

22:29.250 --> 22:32.166
if countries weaponize,
or not even weaponize,

22:32.250 --> 22:33.625
but say, "You know what?

22:33.709 --> 22:35.542
"I need a little bit more,
or a little bit less rain.

22:35.625 --> 22:37.291
I'm gonna do this.
I'm gonna add that."

22:37.375 --> 22:40.458
Could this be
the new arms race?

22:40.542 --> 22:43.500
No technologies come without
the potential for misuse.

22:43.583 --> 22:46.333
So, I think there are
really two kinds of misuse
we're worried about.

22:46.417 --> 22:49.375
One is, sort of,
actual misuse in action.

22:49.458 --> 22:52.166
That is, some country
tries to make more rain
in one place,

22:52.250 --> 22:53.875
and that makes it
worse for somebody else.

22:53.959 --> 22:55.875
That's a realistic fear,
I think.

22:56.792 --> 22:58.709
Smith:
And weather
manipulation technology

22:58.792 --> 23:00.375
is already being tested.

23:00.458 --> 23:02.750
(firing)

23:02.834 --> 23:05.375
Newswoman:
China spends millions
of dollars every year

23:05.458 --> 23:08.250
on the world's largest
cloud-seeding program,

23:08.333 --> 23:11.125
using it frequently
to mitigate drought.

23:12.583 --> 23:14.166
Another form
of misuse is the--

23:14.250 --> 23:16.375
the misuse of these
being over-promoted

23:16.458 --> 23:18.542
and being used as a way
to weaken efforts

23:18.625 --> 23:20.834
to cut emissions
of carbon pollution,

23:20.917 --> 23:23.750
which we must cut
if we want to deal
with the climate crisis.

23:23.834 --> 23:25.208
This is our solution, then,

23:25.291 --> 23:27.041
and we can keep driving
all our cars and everything.

23:27.125 --> 23:28.542
Absolutely.

23:28.625 --> 23:30.166
Say, the big petrol states,

23:30.250 --> 23:33.208
or Exxon, or people who
want to push against

23:33.291 --> 23:35.709
the need to reduce
CO2 emissions,

23:35.792 --> 23:37.875
they will over-claim
how well this works

23:37.959 --> 23:39.375
and kind of
want to use it

23:39.458 --> 23:41.250
-as a "Get out
of Jail Free" card.
-Right.

23:41.333 --> 23:43.583
So they'll want to say, "Ah,
we don't need to worry now.

23:43.667 --> 23:45.083
"Just go back
and drive your SUVs

23:45.166 --> 23:46.458
"and fly as much as you like,

23:46.542 --> 23:48.041
and we don't need
to cut emissions."

23:49.333 --> 23:51.792
Smith:
Our failure to stop
greenhouse emissions

23:51.875 --> 23:54.542
after years of scientific
evidence and warnings

23:54.625 --> 23:57.208
has gotten us
to this dangerous place,

23:57.291 --> 24:00.083
and it is quickly becoming
the greatest threat
to our species

24:00.166 --> 24:01.875
The irony here is,

24:01.959 --> 24:05.041
that the scientists
most invested in
studying geoengineering,

24:05.125 --> 24:08.917
are the same ones
who are most afraid
of its consequences.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.417
Box:
We have started this era
of-- of geoengineering.

24:12.500 --> 24:13.458
It's just beginning.

24:13.542 --> 24:15.583
It's going to be a wild ride.

24:15.667 --> 24:18.041
I don't see us
backing away from it.

24:18.125 --> 24:20.750
It's the engineering project
of the century.

24:20.834 --> 24:24.083
Field:
There's this whole moral
hazard to geoengineering.

24:24.166 --> 24:25.500
If you have a solution,

24:25.583 --> 24:27.917
people say, "Great!
I don't have to change a thing."

24:28.000 --> 24:30.291
And that's not the message
that people should get.

24:30.375 --> 24:32.750
Smith:
I hope this
never has to be used,

24:32.834 --> 24:36.166
but if we get to a point
where we do have to use it,

24:36.250 --> 24:37.667
it's probably going to be...

24:37.750 --> 24:39.417
(Neukermans speaking)

24:39.500 --> 24:41.333
We should be thinking of this,
you know, as a war.

24:41.417 --> 24:42.834
Yeah.

24:44.125 --> 24:46.125
Oldham:
I think we need to be
reducing our emissions

24:46.208 --> 24:47.458
in multiple different areas.

24:47.542 --> 24:49.959
You can't rely on
one solution for everything.

24:50.041 --> 24:51.083
This is not a panacea.

24:51.166 --> 24:53.417
We would be
foolish as a species

24:53.500 --> 24:56.083
to rely on
just one technology
or just one solution.

24:56.166 --> 24:58.834
We need multiple solutions.
It's a huge problem.

24:58.917 --> 25:00.458
Watson:
Worst case scenario,

25:00.542 --> 25:02.625
it might be the dumbest
thing we ever do.

25:02.709 --> 25:04.166
It's a very odd situation
to work on something

25:04.250 --> 25:07.125
that you really hope
never happens.

25:07.208 --> 25:11.166
Were we ever to actually
deploy solar geoengineering
full-scale,

25:11.250 --> 25:14.208
it's the clearest indication
that we failed.

25:14.291 --> 25:17.000
It's a desperate act,
make no bones about it.

25:17.083 --> 25:19.166
If there's a way
not to do this,

25:19.250 --> 25:22.667
every academic
that's working on it
will rejoice.
