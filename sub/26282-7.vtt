WEBVTT

00:01.035 --> 00:02.570
Scrub in with The Resident.

00:02.603 --> 00:04.638
This is a business.
It's not a charity.

00:04.672 --> 00:06.574
Catch all-new episodes Mondays,

00:06.607 --> 00:08.542
and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.576 --> 00:11.912
9-1-1, Lethal Weapon,
and Empire.

00:11.945 --> 00:14.248
We lost Empire,
but we are still here.

00:14.282 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.319
Previously on The Resident...

00:18.352 --> 00:19.987
Medical devices
gave me my life back.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.756
Total hip replacement.
It made me a true believer.

00:22.790 --> 00:25.059
Have you arranged for someone
to teach you Bhangra?

00:25.093 --> 00:26.560
JULIAN: You studying up
to do a Bollywood dance?

00:26.594 --> 00:29.263
DEVON: My fiancÃ©e insists,
but I've two left feet.

00:29.297 --> 00:30.664
JULIAN: Well, maybe I can help.
I was a dancer.

00:30.698 --> 00:33.834
I've been thinking about
creating my own medical device.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.503
Watching what you do
gave me the idea.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.871
-Oh, I'm assigning you to Ortho.

00:37.905 --> 00:40.374
-Okafor belongs to me.
-I belong to no one.

00:40.408 --> 00:42.243
My sister. She OD'd on Oxy.

00:42.276 --> 00:43.244
I'm not just doing this
for me anymore,

00:43.277 --> 00:44.245
I'm staying clean
for both of us.

00:44.278 --> 00:46.013
I'm not worried.
Do I look worried?

00:46.046 --> 00:47.981
Perhaps you should let go
of kitty's leash.

00:54.955 --> 00:59.760
Camping for a bachelor party
weekend

00:59.793 --> 01:01.729
What I want to know is
who sleeps in the middle?

01:01.762 --> 01:03.131
Was this Devon's idea?

01:03.164 --> 01:05.466
He was fine with a couple beers
at Waylon's. But Irving...

01:05.499 --> 01:07.401
Is making up for getting
kicked out of Boy Scouts.

01:08.769 --> 01:10.571
Hey, the nurses are planning
a girls' night tonight.

01:10.604 --> 01:11.572
We're thinking bowling.

01:11.605 --> 01:12.906
Oh, I do not like sports

01:12.940 --> 01:14.208
where I have to wear
other people's shoes.

01:14.242 --> 01:17.378
Okay, fine. Karaoke?
Come on.

01:17.411 --> 01:18.779
Jessica's in Savannah
for the weekend.

01:18.812 --> 01:20.314
I have zero obligations.

01:20.348 --> 01:22.082
This is the first time
I've been free

01:22.116 --> 01:24.318
-since she got out of rehab.

01:24.352 --> 01:27.087
It's Conrad.
Hey, what's up?

01:28.256 --> 01:31.559
You're kidding me.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.161
Okay, yeah.
I'll be right there.

01:33.194 --> 01:34.662
What's going on?

01:34.695 --> 01:36.130
Jess is not in Savannah.

01:51.479 --> 01:55.516
I'm burning up.
What's wrong with me?

01:55.549 --> 01:58.986
Jess...
You okay?

01:59.019 --> 02:01.922
I'm fine. I told Conrad
not to call you,

02:01.955 --> 02:03.524
but clearly,
he can't keep a promise.

02:03.557 --> 02:06.026
I made no promise and,
Jess, she needed to know.

02:06.059 --> 02:08.596
Since when does Chastain
do drug trials?

02:08.629 --> 02:10.964
Since Bell discovered
they're a cash cow, I imagine.

02:10.998 --> 02:13.133
-It's for cancer.

02:13.167 --> 02:15.135
Healthy people volunteered.

02:15.169 --> 02:18.038
Half of us got a cancer drug,
half of us got a placebo.

02:18.071 --> 02:19.307
Do we know who got the placebo?

02:19.340 --> 02:20.674
No. It's a double-blind.

02:20.708 --> 02:23.277
Jessie's fine right now,
but John isn't.

02:23.311 --> 02:24.778
Fever and vomiting.

02:24.812 --> 02:26.280
Why didn't you just tell me?

02:26.314 --> 02:28.048
Because I knew
you would lecture me.

02:28.081 --> 02:29.850
This is my fault.

02:29.883 --> 02:31.852
I told Jess it'd be a good way
to make some money.

02:31.885 --> 02:34.688
I've done them before. I've
never had a reaction like this.

02:37.525 --> 02:40.394
Excuse me.
Who authorized this?

02:41.695 --> 02:43.997
What... what are you
doing here?

02:44.031 --> 02:47.635
I'm a doctor.
She's an NP.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.803
And John here
is in significant distress.

02:49.837 --> 02:52.172
He's having
a normal reaction for

02:52.206 --> 02:54.174
a Phase 1
first-in-human clinical trial.

02:54.208 --> 02:55.876
Reactions are what
we're here to document.

02:55.909 --> 02:57.645
Now, I'm gonna
have to ask you to go.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.247
Oh, you don't have to ask.
Jess, come on.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.014
Um. No, I'm not gonna
leave John.

03:01.048 --> 03:02.350
Uh, you will lose your fee
if you quit.

03:02.383 --> 03:04.017
I want to go.

03:04.051 --> 03:05.753
I don't care about the money.

03:05.786 --> 03:09.056
-Call rapid response!

03:09.089 --> 03:11.058
We need to get him
to the ER now!

03:13.961 --> 03:15.963
*

03:28.075 --> 03:29.510
John Losurdo. 30 years old.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.445
Fever, vomiting,
a syncopal episode.

03:31.479 --> 03:33.347
A suspected reaction
to an immunotherapy trial drug.

03:33.381 --> 03:35.249
-Apparently so.

03:35.283 --> 03:38.919
Uh, BP's 90/55.
Hang one liter of normal saline

03:38.952 --> 03:40.588
and give him four Ondansetron
to help with the vomiting.

03:40.621 --> 03:42.790
One, two, three.

03:42.823 --> 03:45.259
-I hope so; we don't know enough

03:45.293 --> 03:46.927
about the drug, or his health
when he took it.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.196
-Rehab.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.564
He's such a great guy.

03:50.598 --> 03:51.632
Every time I wanted to bail,

03:51.665 --> 03:53.033
he convinced me to stay.

03:53.066 --> 03:56.203
I'm supposed to have a consult
with Mina right now,

03:56.236 --> 03:57.371
but I want to stay here
with you.

03:57.405 --> 03:58.439
No. It's fine. Go.

03:58.472 --> 04:00.040
-We've got this.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.575
Go. Steth.

04:01.609 --> 04:03.644
IRVING: Let's get a second line
and some blood work.

04:03.677 --> 04:05.946
DEVON:
Babe, when you check the time,

04:05.979 --> 04:10.150
this tiny little camera--
it scans your retina,

04:10.183 --> 04:11.585
and it sends your vitals
to me like that.

04:11.619 --> 04:13.721
That is so cool.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.255
I can't believe
you designed that.

04:15.289 --> 04:16.490
-Yeah.

04:16.524 --> 04:17.925
If my dad had been wearing this,

04:17.958 --> 04:20.294
I could have caught his heart
attack before it happened.

04:20.328 --> 04:24.498
Now, wait, there is just
one more thing that I need.

04:27.835 --> 04:31.238
Priya Nair, would you
do me the honor of being

04:31.271 --> 04:34.241
my first trial participant?

04:34.274 --> 04:36.477
My beta tester?

04:36.510 --> 04:38.846
Oh, yes. Yes, yes.

04:41.281 --> 04:45.319
Um. First,
there is actually something

04:45.353 --> 04:47.154
I need to talk to you about.

04:47.187 --> 04:49.523
All right. Listen, If this is
about who's sitting where,

04:49.557 --> 04:50.591
honestly, whatever you want...

04:50.624 --> 04:53.093
No, nothing about the wedding.

04:53.126 --> 04:56.864
Um, Devon,
I've been offered a spot

04:56.897 --> 04:59.500
on an investigative
journalism team.

04:59.533 --> 05:02.770
W... That's amazing.
Babe, I'm so proud of you.

05:02.803 --> 05:05.873
It's at the San Francisco
Chronicle.

05:05.906 --> 05:09.943
-If I take it,
I have to move there. Soon.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.945
When? Because we're getting
married in two weeks.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.113
How would that even happen?

05:13.146 --> 05:14.648
A lot of couples live
in different cities.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.083
We could make it work.

05:17.718 --> 05:20.688
Nothing is decided yet. Let's
talk more when you get back

05:20.721 --> 05:23.557
from your
bachelor weekend, okay?

05:23.591 --> 05:25.593
I'm late.

05:43.744 --> 05:46.079
You need to stop the trial now.

05:46.113 --> 05:48.048
Are all your nurses
this dramatic, Dr. Bell?

05:48.081 --> 05:50.718
Oh, I hear
that one of your participants

05:50.751 --> 05:53.020
is in our ER
with life-threatening symptoms.

05:53.053 --> 05:54.822
One of our participants got sick

05:54.855 --> 05:56.557
to his stomach
and a bit dehydrated.

05:56.590 --> 05:58.592
-Nothing life-threatening
about it.
-Oh, please.

05:58.626 --> 06:01.562
Two more are deteriorating
as we speak.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.731
Cancer is a ferocious enemy.

06:03.764 --> 06:06.434
We fight it with strong drugs.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.436
Please get your staff
to back down,

06:08.469 --> 06:10.604
or Chastain won't see a dime.

06:10.638 --> 06:12.072
Oh, and what's
a lawsuit gonna cost

06:12.105 --> 06:13.407
if one of these patients dies?

06:13.441 --> 06:16.076
Your trial can continue,

06:16.109 --> 06:17.845
but I expect you
to notify me right away

06:17.878 --> 06:19.680
if any of your participants
have reactions

06:19.713 --> 06:20.981
outside the range of normal.

06:24.985 --> 06:27.421
One of them's my sister.

06:33.093 --> 06:36.464
Perfect vacation:
mountain, desert or sea?

06:36.497 --> 06:37.865
Uh, desert.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.399
When you're done
with this charade,

06:39.433 --> 06:40.601
I need to talk with you.

06:40.634 --> 06:43.403
Okafor, you are my ex-resident.

06:43.437 --> 06:45.405
I'm looking
for my next resident.

06:45.439 --> 06:47.908
And as you can see,
it's an embarrassment of riches.

06:47.941 --> 06:51.111
Or just embarrassing.

06:51.144 --> 06:52.880
-AUSTIN: Next!

06:52.913 --> 06:54.247
Here.

06:54.281 --> 06:56.116
What are you doing here?

06:56.149 --> 06:58.385
I need a consult from you
and Conrad on a patient.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.153
His name is Ernest LeVasseur.

07:00.187 --> 07:02.490
Ernie?

07:02.523 --> 07:04.725
Oh, woman, you should've
led with that.

07:04.758 --> 07:07.561
He owns the Grill and Gumbo and
makes the best ribs in Atlanta.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.396
No, not anymore, he doesn't.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.264
Why

07:11.298 --> 07:13.934
The better question
is "What isn't?"

07:16.136 --> 07:19.106
Mr. and Mrs. LeVasseur?

07:19.139 --> 07:21.509
This is the brilliant
Dr. Hawkins.

07:21.542 --> 07:24.578
He's one of our top
diagnosticians here at Chastain.

07:24.612 --> 07:26.980
Oh, and this is Dr. Austin.

07:29.016 --> 07:33.453
Cardiothoracic.
I'm just a smidge above average.

07:33.487 --> 07:35.856
Ernie, it is an honor
to meet you, brother.

07:35.889 --> 07:39.392
I am a huge fan of your dry rub.

07:42.395 --> 07:45.599
Oh, he's nearly blind,
and his hearing's almost gone.

07:45.633 --> 07:48.502
The doctor loves
your dry rub, Ernie.

07:48.536 --> 07:50.638
-I had an egg with some bacon.
-Honey, they don't care

07:50.671 --> 07:53.473
what you had for breakfast.
He talks nonsense like this

07:53.507 --> 07:55.342
all the time now.
My brother-in-law says

07:55.375 --> 07:56.810
it's early onset dementia.

07:56.844 --> 07:58.278
MINA:
Neurology doesn't think so.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.047
When did he lose his vision?

08:00.080 --> 08:03.450
About six months ago,
and then hearing went next.

08:03.483 --> 08:06.620
Like, every other day,
another part of him was gone.

08:06.654 --> 08:08.321
Mind if I have a look?

08:08.355 --> 08:09.723
Yeah, sure.

08:09.757 --> 08:12.726
First he developed
hypothyroidism,

08:12.760 --> 08:14.628
and then reflux esophagitis.

08:14.662 --> 08:19.499
His echocardiogram shows heart
failure due to cardiomyopathy.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.871
Some kind of rash
around his neck,

08:23.904 --> 08:25.639
warm to the touch.

08:25.673 --> 08:28.508
Let's get another
thyroid and renal panel,

08:28.542 --> 08:31.478
and let's add on an RPR,
folate and B12. Medical history?

08:31.511 --> 08:34.314
MINA:
Left hip replacement in 2012.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.650
Kidney stones last year,
but that's about it.

08:36.684 --> 08:38.586
Any complaints of pain?

08:38.619 --> 08:42.055
No, he doesn't complain
about anything. He never has.

08:42.089 --> 08:46.627
Ernie's always been the
happiest, most optimistic...

08:48.796 --> 08:52.265
You know, it's like he's here,
but he's not.

08:52.299 --> 08:55.202
There's almost nothing
left of him.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.539
We understand
how difficult this must be.

08:59.573 --> 09:02.676
Oh, I doubt it. I get up
at 6:00 every morning

09:02.710 --> 09:05.278
and I change his diaper and then

09:05.312 --> 09:07.247
I shower him,
and after he's fed and dressed,

09:07.280 --> 09:09.082
I do it all over again
with the kids.

09:09.116 --> 09:11.451
And after they're fed
and they're dressed

09:11.484 --> 09:13.220
and I send them off to school...

09:15.422 --> 09:17.424
Oh, my God.

09:19.492 --> 09:21.561
I can't do it anymore.

09:21.595 --> 09:23.731
Janine?

09:23.764 --> 09:25.565
Darling?

09:25.599 --> 09:29.202
W

09:29.236 --> 09:31.605
I'm right here!

09:33.240 --> 09:35.208
At least he still
remembers my name.

09:35.242 --> 09:38.211
Sometimes, I...

09:38.245 --> 09:39.813
I really wish that he didn't.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.316
No one takes care
of the caretaker.

09:45.485 --> 09:47.254
We're going
to take care of him here.

09:47.287 --> 09:48.922
You go home, rest.

09:48.956 --> 09:51.191
I will call you as soon
as we know more.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.275
She needs help.
She's close to breaking.

10:08.308 --> 10:11.344
I've notified social services.
They're scheduling a home visit.

10:11.378 --> 10:14.782
A year ago, Ernest
was the life of the party.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.416
What do you think
is wrong with him?

10:16.449 --> 10:18.451
I think he's being poisoned.

10:26.994 --> 10:30.197
I... made...

10:30.230 --> 10:32.632
T-shirts.

10:32.666 --> 10:34.968
I'm not wearing that, bud.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.804
Campsite's booked,
rafts are rented.

10:36.837 --> 10:38.839
Firing up the minivan
at 6:00 p.m. sharp.

10:38.872 --> 10:40.674
Snack situation's on point.

10:40.708 --> 10:43.811
I got ten flavors of chips,
including Nacho Mamma's Nachos.

10:43.844 --> 10:46.213
Don't be late. I already told
Conrad we have a hard out.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.215
Hey, guys.

10:48.248 --> 10:51.351
-Oh, uh, we're crushing it.

10:51.384 --> 10:53.620
You still want
to practice when you get back?

10:53.653 --> 10:55.155
-Ooh!

10:55.188 --> 10:57.490
-Please, never do that again.

10:57.524 --> 11:00.493
Wait, is that
what I think it is?

11:00.527 --> 11:02.495
Beta version 1.0.

11:02.529 --> 11:05.966
How's the retina scan function?
That's what makes it so unique.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.968
Yeah. So far, so good.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.536
Sends the data
directly to the...

11:09.569 --> 11:11.872
Smartphone app.
I remember.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.640
Yeah.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.408
Some of my friends
in Silicon Valley

11:15.442 --> 11:16.910
have been troubleshooting it
for weeks

11:16.944 --> 11:18.746
and it seems to be working well.

11:18.779 --> 11:20.881
Well, you can't test it
on yourself.

11:20.914 --> 11:22.115
You need a beta.

11:24.117 --> 11:26.519
I'll drop an obvious hint
one more time.

11:26.553 --> 11:29.689
You need a beta.

11:31.424 --> 11:32.659
You?

11:36.596 --> 11:38.498
Okay, so, um...

11:38.531 --> 11:40.868
It tests for

11:40.901 --> 11:42.669
-your heart rhythm...
-Uh-huh.

11:42.702 --> 11:47.340
...uh, blood pressure and, um,

11:47.374 --> 11:49.109
-your pulse.

11:49.142 --> 11:51.178
Oh, and it's also gonna tell me
I'm late for surgery.

11:51.211 --> 11:55.215
I got to go.
Keep an eye on me, Pravesh.

11:59.753 --> 12:02.890
-Not great.

12:02.923 --> 12:05.025
His back is killing him.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.960
Well, it'll take time
to metabolize the drug

12:06.994 --> 12:09.529
they gave you,
but we can up your pain meds,

12:09.562 --> 12:11.564
manage the symptoms
in the meantime.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.467
Is that your family?

12:14.501 --> 12:16.203
Yeah.

12:16.236 --> 12:19.940
Ingrid, light of my life.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.143
My wife, Sarah.

12:23.176 --> 12:24.978
She keeps giving me chances,
you know?

12:25.012 --> 12:27.815
They live in South Carolina.

12:27.848 --> 12:31.751
This last stint in rehab
was the first I did on my own...

12:31.785 --> 12:34.054
'cause I want to get better,

12:34.087 --> 12:37.057
for me and for them.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.725
This drug trial was just a way

12:38.758 --> 12:40.593
to come home with some cash
in my pocket.

12:40.627 --> 12:41.761
Help pay the bills,

12:41.795 --> 12:44.131
Ingrid's music lessons.

12:44.164 --> 12:46.433
Love her to death,
but she cannot play her recorder

12:46.466 --> 12:48.235
so well.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.070
At all, really.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.671
Jess, you okay?

12:51.704 --> 12:54.474
Yeah, yeah, I think it's just
a stress headache or something.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.844
Right here?

12:56.877 --> 12:59.179
-Yeah.
-All right.

12:59.212 --> 13:00.347
Jess?

13:04.184 --> 13:07.754
Devon! Irving!

13:07.787 --> 13:10.891
Jessie didn't get the placebo.
Come on, let's get her on a bed.

13:12.325 --> 13:13.760
We're gonna take care
of you, Jess.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.762
Nic, what's happening?
I'm scared.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.966
-I know, but I'm here.
-Oxygen sats are dropping.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.934
Hey, John!
-He can't breathe.

13:20.968 --> 13:24.304
We need to intubate him. Hurry.

13:25.338 --> 13:26.840
Page Conrad to the east wing.

13:26.874 --> 13:28.575
Tell him to check
the other trial patients.

13:33.580 --> 13:34.781
Just like that.

13:37.550 --> 13:40.653
Get them to the ICU.

13:40.687 --> 13:43.623
Again?
I-I told Dr. Bell...

13:43.656 --> 13:45.893
Two of your trial patients are
in the ICU with complications.

13:45.926 --> 13:48.795
It cannot be from of our drug.
This dose was scaled back

13:48.828 --> 13:51.364
500 fold for what was
proven safe in monkeys.

13:51.398 --> 13:53.800
Monkeys?

13:53.833 --> 13:56.236
Really?

13:56.269 --> 13:57.905
Hey. Hey, hold up.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.672
What do you think you're doing?

13:59.706 --> 14:01.408
Clearing the room.
Get these two

14:01.441 --> 14:03.476
to the ER for observation.

14:03.510 --> 14:06.546
-I am beginning
to lose my patience.
-And mine's long gone.

14:06.579 --> 14:10.817
Trust me, you don't want
to push me any further.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.719
I'm calling Bell.

14:12.752 --> 14:16.089
I already did.

14:16.123 --> 14:18.825
Give me an update.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.428
Adele and Mauricio

14:21.461 --> 14:23.830
have a fever, pain
and vomiting.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.598
Jessie is having
trouble breathing,

14:25.632 --> 14:28.435
so we have her on oxygen,
and John is on a vent,

14:28.468 --> 14:31.371
with multisystem organ failure.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.676
I don't have to tell you
your trial is over,

14:36.709 --> 14:38.245
and Chastain is not responsible

14:38.278 --> 14:39.913
if anyone dies
from whatever the hell

14:39.947 --> 14:41.448
-you gave them.
-I am telling you,

14:41.481 --> 14:42.950
it is sepsis from an infection

14:42.983 --> 14:44.517
they caught here.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.686
The drug vials were prepared
by your company.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.621
-If there's any
contamination...
-Hey, the blame game can wait.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.590
We need information
on this drug.

14:50.623 --> 14:52.459
Yeah, well, that's not happening
because it's not the drug.

14:52.492 --> 14:53.893
Look, you don't know that.
I want every bit of data

14:53.927 --> 14:56.696
you have in my hands
in the next ten minutes.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.098
I'm not asking.

15:05.305 --> 15:07.874
It's really deep in there.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.209
Well, it's only
a quadruple bypass,

15:09.242 --> 15:11.544
but I'm sure your inability

15:11.578 --> 15:13.080
to get deep enough will be

15:13.113 --> 15:15.115
just fine with the family

15:15.148 --> 15:16.749
-after their loved one has...
-Wait, wait.

15:16.783 --> 15:18.952
I think I got it.

15:18.986 --> 15:20.220
-AUSTIN: Yup.

15:20.253 --> 15:24.157
Sam's dead, and so are you.

15:24.191 --> 15:26.426
Allow me to demonstrate.

15:26.459 --> 15:27.794
Oh.

15:27.827 --> 15:29.762
I'm starting to get
the feeling you miss me,

15:29.796 --> 15:32.299
but your position's
almost filled.

15:32.332 --> 15:34.067
Ernest's tests are in.

15:34.101 --> 15:36.769
The levels of cobalt in his
blood are 200 times normal.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.110
He has metallosis.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.015
So you were right.

15:48.048 --> 15:49.516
He is being poisoned.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.985
but from what?

15:52.019 --> 15:53.420
KIT:
Here's the culprit--

15:53.453 --> 15:55.322
his metal-on-metal
hip replacement.

15:55.355 --> 15:58.458
When the metal ball and metal
cup slide against each other,

15:58.491 --> 16:01.361
tiny particles can flake off
and enter the bloodstream,

16:01.394 --> 16:04.697
sending cobalt and chromium
to every major organ.

16:04.731 --> 16:07.334
And causing muscle
and tissue atrophy,

16:07.367 --> 16:09.469
acetabular
and femoral osteolysis,

16:09.502 --> 16:11.438
-and pseudotumors.
-JULIAN: I don't get it.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.107
Why would anyone sell a hip
implant that could leak poison?

16:14.141 --> 16:15.308
Imagine the lawsuits.

16:15.342 --> 16:17.777
Oh, pennies to their profits.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.846
The question is,
how does something this flawed

16:19.879 --> 16:21.514
get FDA approval to begin with?

16:21.548 --> 16:24.651
The 510 process.
This lets companies fast-track

16:24.684 --> 16:28.455
a device, if a device is similar
to an existing device.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.723
Which helps lifesaving devices
get on the market fast.

16:30.757 --> 16:34.461
Even if that existing device
was recalled for defects.

16:34.494 --> 16:35.728
Surely there are
protections in place

16:35.762 --> 16:37.330
that stop people
from taking advantage.

16:37.364 --> 16:39.366
Not when medical device
executives sit on the board

16:39.399 --> 16:41.134
of the FDA.

16:41.168 --> 16:42.902
The fox is guarding
the henhouse.

16:42.935 --> 16:45.872
KIT:
Well, let's focus
on what we can fix.

16:45.905 --> 16:48.375
Mr. LeVasseur is going to need
a left ceramic on polyethylene

16:48.408 --> 16:50.243
hip prosthesis
to get the metal poison

16:50.277 --> 16:51.678
out of his system.

16:51.711 --> 16:53.012
Does QuoVadis
carry one of those?

16:53.046 --> 16:55.815
We do. I'll have it couriered.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.584
KIT:
Well, the good news is

16:57.617 --> 16:59.186
when leaking metal hips
are replaced,

16:59.219 --> 17:01.354
most patients make
a full recovery.

17:01.388 --> 17:03.056
I don't think he'll ever
regain his eyesight.

17:03.090 --> 17:06.759
No, but surgery will certainly
help all of his other problems.

17:06.793 --> 17:08.428
If it doesn't kill him.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.933
DEVON:
Atlanta was never
Priya's first choice,

17:13.966 --> 17:16.503
but I'm finally feeling settled,

17:16.536 --> 17:18.105
like my life is on track.

17:18.138 --> 17:20.707
So move, or deal
with living apart.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.375
You're not so great
at this, are you?

17:22.409 --> 17:24.777
I'm exceptional at it, actually.

17:24.811 --> 17:27.013
I made you face the stark
reality of your choice.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.716
If you want hand-holding,
go elsewhere.

17:29.749 --> 17:32.419
Well, Julian's got
a healthy pulse.

17:32.452 --> 17:34.554
Her vitals are impressive.

17:34.587 --> 17:37.557
You are taking stalking
to a whole new level.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.426
I'm just testing
my device, Mina.

17:39.459 --> 17:42.362
-Hm. Keep telling yourself that.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.131
-It is.

17:44.164 --> 17:46.699
Safe and tested... Okay.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.701
Is she always so...

17:48.735 --> 17:51.971
Yeah, yeah. She's, uh,
she's very consistent.

17:52.004 --> 17:54.941
So, how are my numbers?

17:54.974 --> 17:57.210
Beautiful.

17:57.244 --> 17:59.379
-I mean, they're, you know...

17:59.412 --> 18:00.480
They're-they're good.
They're great.

18:00.513 --> 18:02.815
Your device is working.

18:02.849 --> 18:05.585
So far, it is.
But less coffee,

18:05.618 --> 18:09.088
more water.
You're a little dehydrated.

18:09.122 --> 18:11.124
So a fourth latte
is overdoing it?

18:12.325 --> 18:13.760
Are you being serious?

18:13.793 --> 18:16.796
Do not even judge. I saw you
in the residents' lounge,

18:16.829 --> 18:19.766
chugging what I'm pretty sure
was a can of grape soda.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.968
Okay, don't knock it
until you try it.

18:22.001 --> 18:24.737
Oh, I tried it, when I was six.

18:24.771 --> 18:29.476
All right, you know what?
The residents' lounge

18:29.509 --> 18:32.212
is for residents,
not device reps, so...

18:33.446 --> 18:35.782
Oh, so that's how
it's gonna be, huh?

18:35.815 --> 18:38.785
Yeah, it's gonna be
just like that.

18:38.818 --> 18:40.720
Okay.

18:42.455 --> 18:46.025
I saw this really cute apartment
in Inman Park.

18:46.058 --> 18:50.029
Landlord wanted
a cash deposit, so...

18:52.031 --> 18:53.933
I'm too old to live
with my sister.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.303
Way too old.

18:58.538 --> 19:01.208
I shouldn't have lied to you
about Savannah. I'm sorry.

19:01.241 --> 19:03.109
I just...

19:03.142 --> 19:05.645
I wanted to show you I could
do something on my own.

19:05.678 --> 19:08.215
I thought maybe things
could go back

19:08.248 --> 19:09.816
to the way they were when...

19:09.849 --> 19:13.220
-when we were close.
-Hey.

19:13.253 --> 19:15.822
We're close now.

19:15.855 --> 19:19.158
We're, like, too close.
You're like a barnacle.

19:19.192 --> 19:21.328
Stop. It hurts.

19:25.398 --> 19:26.833
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

19:28.735 --> 19:30.136
What's going on?

19:30.169 --> 19:31.704
We have information on the drug.

19:31.738 --> 19:34.474
It's an agonist
for the CD28 receptor.

19:34.507 --> 19:37.744
So the drug targets the immune
system to fight cancer.

19:37.777 --> 19:41.814
Kisic claims the participants
all have a massive infection.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.750
Septic shock fits the symptoms.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.184
I don't think it's septic shock.

19:45.218 --> 19:46.886
I think it's a systemic
inflammatory response

19:46.919 --> 19:48.555
from a cytokine storm.

19:48.588 --> 19:50.657
There's no way to know for sure.
There's no quick test

19:50.690 --> 19:52.559
for a cytokine storm.

19:52.592 --> 19:54.160
They both have
the same presentation,

19:54.193 --> 19:56.363
but cytokine is caused
by an immunotherapy drug.

19:56.396 --> 19:58.531
If there is any hope

19:58.565 --> 20:00.199
of stopping this attack
on their organs,

20:00.233 --> 20:03.236
we need to at least
start John and Jessie

20:03.270 --> 20:05.171
on high dose steroids now.

20:05.204 --> 20:08.608
But if it is
a massive infection,

20:08.641 --> 20:10.443
high dose steroids
could kill them.

20:10.477 --> 20:11.911
We can't wait,
we have to act now.

20:11.944 --> 20:13.713
My mom died
from a bad judgment call.

20:13.746 --> 20:14.914
We need to be certain.

20:14.947 --> 20:18.451
You know that's not possible.

20:22.555 --> 20:25.157
My gut tells me this is right.

20:31.230 --> 20:34.033
Okay.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.636
So let's start steroid treatment

20:36.669 --> 20:38.938
on John and Jessie,

20:38.971 --> 20:40.773
with your permission.

20:40.807 --> 20:44.210
And the others,
we wait until we know for sure

20:44.243 --> 20:47.514
that you've made the right call,
and hope like hell it is.

20:54.253 --> 20:57.156
MINA:
Ernest can't make this decision.

20:57.189 --> 21:00.660
You are his medical proxy.

21:00.693 --> 21:03.296
Without the surgery,
how long does he have?

21:03.330 --> 21:06.265
Another year, maybe, but he will
continue to deteriorate.

21:06.299 --> 21:08.568
But the surgery
could kill him today?

21:08.601 --> 21:11.070
Yes, but if he survives,
he can finally be himself again.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.271
ERNEST:
Janine?

21:22.382 --> 21:25.818
I'm Korean.

21:25.852 --> 21:27.253
He learned to speak Korean

21:27.286 --> 21:30.823
so we could speak it together.

21:30.857 --> 21:34.661
Ernest has always been
so romantic.

21:43.870 --> 21:46.272
Don't cry.

21:46.305 --> 21:49.308
Don't.

21:49.342 --> 21:51.578
It's okay.

21:56.916 --> 22:00.553
I said I couldn't stand
to take care of him anymore,

22:00.587 --> 22:04.023
and now I can't bear
to lose him.

22:06.693 --> 22:08.160
Will you both be in the surgery?

22:08.194 --> 22:10.162
Oh, Dr. Okafor

22:10.196 --> 22:13.700
will be assisting Dr. Voss,
who is an exceptional...

22:13.733 --> 22:15.902
But-but what if something
happens with his weak heart?

22:17.269 --> 22:19.439
I'll sign the consent form...

22:21.340 --> 22:24.210
...if you'll both
be in the room with him.

22:27.614 --> 22:30.383
: Nic, I'm drowning.
-Your...

22:30.417 --> 22:32.385
your lungs aren't getting
enough oxygen.

22:32.419 --> 22:34.253
We're bringing in a ventilator
to help you breathe.

22:34.286 --> 22:35.455
-I'll take it from here, Nic.

22:37.356 --> 22:39.058
The steroids aren't working.

22:39.091 --> 22:41.360
-Steroids take time.

22:41.394 --> 22:44.330
But, Nic, you know
there are no guarantees.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.098
God, why did she do this?

22:46.132 --> 22:48.267
We can't think
about that right now.

22:48.300 --> 22:49.569
Nic.

22:51.604 --> 22:54.073
If you have something
you need to say to Jessie...

22:55.608 --> 22:57.910
...now would be a good time.

23:06.486 --> 23:08.455
Jessie, I need you
to be strong, okay?

23:08.488 --> 23:09.756
I need you to fight for me.

23:09.789 --> 23:11.458
All right?
I'm gonna be right here

23:11.491 --> 23:13.392
-the whole time.
-BOLTON: Ready to intubate.

23:15.327 --> 23:17.764
I love you, okay?

23:19.799 --> 23:21.367
I'm right here.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.235
MINA:
Patient Ernest LeVasseur

23:23.269 --> 23:24.737
in for a left hip revision.

23:24.771 --> 23:28.074
One ceramic-on-polyethylene
hip device.

23:28.107 --> 23:29.476
Left. Correct.

23:29.509 --> 23:31.478
AUSTIN:
Time-out complete.

23:31.511 --> 23:33.446
Surgical field prepped.

23:33.480 --> 23:34.781
It's showtime, party people.

23:34.814 --> 23:36.649
And don't worry, Dr. Voss.

23:36.683 --> 23:40.753
I'm just here monitoring
Monsieur LeVasseur's poor heart.

23:40.787 --> 23:43.155
I promised your resident
that I would be quiet.

23:43.189 --> 23:44.991
It will be hard for him.

23:45.024 --> 23:46.292
Let's relish it, ladies.

23:46.325 --> 23:47.594
10 blade.

23:54.634 --> 23:57.403
Dr. Okafor, retract
the subcutaneous tissue.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.438
MINA:
Retractors.

24:07.980 --> 24:09.682
KIT:
Oh, crap.

24:09.716 --> 24:12.685
The metal particles
have caused the soft tissue

24:12.719 --> 24:14.621
around the joint to harden.

24:14.654 --> 24:17.690
When I cut into it,
it liquefies.

24:17.724 --> 24:19.492
MINA:
The necrotic tissue's completely

24:19.526 --> 24:21.160
encompassing the hip joint.

24:21.193 --> 24:22.795
Gross.

24:22.829 --> 24:24.463
I-I've never seen...

24:24.497 --> 24:25.998
:
...anything like it.

24:26.032 --> 24:28.334
Suction.

24:28.367 --> 24:31.103
If you're going to hurl,
best to not do it

24:31.137 --> 24:32.739
in a sterile environment.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.342
I'll be right back.

24:42.649 --> 24:44.383
What were you chopping?

24:44.416 --> 24:45.718
Carrots.

24:45.752 --> 24:47.787
They kind of looked
like my pinky.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.592
Irving!

24:53.660 --> 24:54.961
Somebody dying over here?

24:54.994 --> 24:56.128
I only cut my pinky.

24:56.162 --> 24:57.296
Wait, am I dying?

24:57.329 --> 24:58.565
Take over for me.

24:58.598 --> 25:00.032
Julian's having a heart attack.

25:02.268 --> 25:03.736
You're not dying.

25:06.405 --> 25:08.841
-Yeah.

25:08.875 --> 25:11.010
I was just feeling faint.

25:11.043 --> 25:13.479
The surgery--
it got kind of ugly.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.748
-Tachycardia.

25:15.782 --> 25:17.850
Not a heart attack.

25:17.884 --> 25:19.819
-Safe to say

25:19.852 --> 25:21.487
that my device overreacted.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.189
-Big-time.

25:23.222 --> 25:24.657
It'll get there.

25:24.691 --> 25:26.225
Thank you for checking on me.

25:26.258 --> 25:28.194
Of course.

25:29.729 --> 25:32.031
You should have seen
that hip implant.

25:32.064 --> 25:35.334
That poor guy,
his whole life is ruined.

25:35.367 --> 25:38.504
And who knows if it's
the same one that's in me?

25:38.537 --> 25:41.140
You have to call your ortho
and find out.

25:43.375 --> 25:44.811
I will.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.081
Thank you, Devon.

26:04.997 --> 26:08.100
Jessie's stable on the vent
and vasopressors.

26:08.134 --> 26:10.402
That's...

26:10.436 --> 26:12.104
That's good news.

26:14.674 --> 26:18.611
Go to the lounge.
Lie down.

26:18.645 --> 26:21.280
I'll come get you
if anything changes.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.287
Thank you.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.427
She's gonna get better.

26:35.461 --> 26:37.563
And I'm a thousand percent
not going river rafting

26:37.596 --> 26:39.298
with Devon and Irving,
which means I'm here

26:39.331 --> 26:41.367
and I'm here with you
and I'm here with Jessie.

26:43.636 --> 26:46.472
NIC:
I always thought, if we
ended up here, it would be

26:46.505 --> 26:50.176
because of an overdose,
but a drug trial?

26:50.209 --> 26:53.646
I can't even imagine how
difficult this must be for you.

26:58.685 --> 27:00.019
He's in V tach.

27:00.052 --> 27:01.487
Get a crash cart in here!

27:01.520 --> 27:03.122
His pulse is thready.

27:03.155 --> 27:05.624
I need one of epi
and an amp of bicarb.

27:05.658 --> 27:06.926
Lost his pulse.

27:06.959 --> 27:08.460
Starting compressions.

27:16.903 --> 27:20.206
CONRAD:
John got the steroids too late.

27:20.239 --> 27:21.808
NIC:
He was 30 years old.

27:21.841 --> 27:23.242
His poor wife and little girl.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.146
What if we didn't give Jess
the steroids on time?

27:27.179 --> 27:28.748
-She could be next.

27:30.717 --> 27:31.851
Okay. I'll call you back.

27:31.884 --> 27:33.019
This is unbelievable.

27:33.052 --> 27:35.354
This is a disaster.

27:35.387 --> 27:37.356
You can expect
an independent investigation.

27:37.389 --> 27:39.158
-I am gonna have you...
-Of Chastain.

27:39.191 --> 27:41.994
The wing you leased us
is clearly not up to code.

27:42.028 --> 27:44.330
I would think hard before you
threaten us with malpractice.

27:44.363 --> 27:47.299
A man is dead. A lawsuit
is the least of your problems.

27:47.333 --> 27:49.401
You could be facing
manslaughter charges.

27:49.435 --> 27:53.472
Me? He misdiagnosed
and didn't treat

27:53.505 --> 27:56.375
for what they
actually have: sepsis.

27:56.408 --> 27:57.877
We need to stop steroids

27:57.910 --> 27:59.578
and start an aggressive course
of antibiotics.

27:59.611 --> 28:01.047
Antibiotics alone
will kill them.

28:01.080 --> 28:02.581
What we need to do
is up the steroids.

28:02.614 --> 28:04.583
And when they die,
that's on you.

28:04.616 --> 28:06.052
Just... give us a minute.

28:06.085 --> 28:09.088
No, no, no.
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.

28:09.121 --> 28:10.689
I need to be privy
to any and all conversations.

28:10.723 --> 28:13.359
Yeah. In your mind.

28:13.392 --> 28:15.694
This is my hospital.

28:15.728 --> 28:17.563
Back off.

28:23.702 --> 28:27.373
So why, exactly, are you so sure
it's a cytokine storm?

28:27.406 --> 28:28.707
Well, we've seen no improvements

28:28.741 --> 28:30.276
in patients
on antibiotics alone.

28:30.309 --> 28:32.278
NIC:
We have seen some in Jessie

28:32.311 --> 28:33.512
since we gave her the steroids.

28:33.545 --> 28:34.781
And John was the first one

28:34.814 --> 28:36.515
to get the drug,
so the cytokine storm

28:36.548 --> 28:38.751
had already done
irreversible harm to his organs.

28:38.785 --> 28:40.753
It wasn't that the steroids
were the wrong call.

28:40.787 --> 28:43.355
It's that we were too late
for John.

28:43.389 --> 28:45.691
-But maybe not for the others.
-And the longer we wait...

28:45.724 --> 28:46.893
Yeah, the less likely
the steroids will work.

28:46.926 --> 28:48.294
Hawkins, just try talking to me

28:48.327 --> 28:49.796
like I've been
practicing medicine

28:49.829 --> 28:51.297
for almost as long
as you've been alive.

28:51.330 --> 28:53.365
It'll prove useful
in these situations.

28:53.399 --> 28:55.267
All right.

28:56.468 --> 28:58.070
Stay the course.

28:58.104 --> 29:00.272
Up the steroids on Jessie.

29:00.306 --> 29:02.842
Start steroids on the other two.

29:03.910 --> 29:05.444
I'll handle Kisic.

29:13.853 --> 29:15.721
-Yes.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.423
My apologies.
That's never happened before.

29:17.456 --> 29:18.891
Hey, things are a little shaky
over here, people.

29:18.925 --> 29:20.927
This is taking way too long
for his heart.

29:20.960 --> 29:22.594
The structural damage
is extensive.

29:22.628 --> 29:24.430
KIT:
Removing the old
acetabular component

29:24.463 --> 29:27.733
took out some of the bone and
created pelvic discontinuity.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.802
I'm not sure we're gonna be able
to complete the surgery.

29:29.836 --> 29:31.770
So you're just
going to close him up?

29:31.804 --> 29:33.840
We'll put in
a temporary spacer, close,

29:33.873 --> 29:35.474
then open him up again
once we get

29:35.507 --> 29:36.508
the proper revision components.

29:38.811 --> 29:40.579
I did some research
before the surgery,

29:40.612 --> 29:43.182
and I brought a triflange cup
as backup, just in case.

29:43.215 --> 29:46.518
Yeah, that works.

29:46.552 --> 29:49.021
It's not something we typically
stock, but... good call.

29:49.055 --> 29:50.823
Glad you made it back
to join us.

29:52.558 --> 29:55.527
Oh! Bloody hell.
The deteriorated hip

29:55.561 --> 29:58.697
caused me to hit
the exterior iliac artery.

29:58.730 --> 30:00.599
-Pressure's dropping fast.
-We need to repair the artery.

30:00.632 --> 30:01.800
Austin, scrub in.

30:01.834 --> 30:03.602
Not enough time.
Okafor is sterile.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.004
I need you,
not a third-year resident.

30:05.037 --> 30:07.006
I've converted a right ventricle

30:07.039 --> 30:10.542
to the center ventricle
in a heart the size of a walnut.

30:10.576 --> 30:13.612
Performed an emergency
tracheotomy in 30 seconds flat.

30:13.645 --> 30:14.813
I'm not just any third-year.

30:14.847 --> 30:15.848
What she said.

30:16.983 --> 30:18.650
Suction.

30:18.684 --> 30:20.352
AUSTIN:
Pressure's still dropping.

30:20.386 --> 30:22.288
-We're losing him.
-Clamp.

30:22.321 --> 30:24.957
There's too much damage. It's
too risky even to bypass it.

30:24.991 --> 30:27.359
When I took over
and made the incision,

30:27.393 --> 30:28.660
you put his life in my hands.

30:28.694 --> 30:30.696
I can do it.
I'll use the patch.

30:30.729 --> 30:31.830
KIT:
What she said.

30:36.002 --> 30:38.337
Adele and Mauricio
are improving on the steroids.

30:38.370 --> 30:39.571
We were right.

30:41.007 --> 30:43.142
The trial drug
caused the cytokine storm.

30:43.175 --> 30:45.344
Yeah, but Jessie
isn't getting much better.

30:45.377 --> 30:46.678
She's breathing on her own,

30:46.712 --> 30:48.080
but her kidneys
are getting worse.

30:49.748 --> 30:51.483
She's in acute kidney failure.

30:51.517 --> 30:53.352
We're gonna have
to put her on dialysis

30:53.385 --> 30:55.621
-until her kidneys recover.
-Yeah, that's if they recover.

31:03.462 --> 31:05.764
Hey.

31:05.797 --> 31:09.568
Hey. Oh, my God,
I was so worried about you.

31:11.037 --> 31:12.939
How's everybody else?

31:15.074 --> 31:18.810
Mauricio and Adele
are doing great.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.914
And John?

31:23.916 --> 31:25.784
I'm so sorry, Jess.

31:25.817 --> 31:26.953
Oh, no.

31:26.986 --> 31:29.088
John didn't make it.

31:29.121 --> 31:31.123
No, don't tell me that.

31:31.157 --> 31:33.192
-No.
-I'm sorry.

31:33.225 --> 31:35.962
-No, no.

31:47.839 --> 31:51.543
Is, uh... is this a bad time?

31:51.577 --> 31:52.744
No.

31:54.013 --> 31:55.881
I talked to
my orthopedic surgeon.

31:55.914 --> 31:58.150
My hip isn't metal-on-metal.

31:58.184 --> 31:59.785
It's safe.

31:59.818 --> 32:02.388
It's tested.
All good.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.090
Well, that must be
a huge relief.

32:04.123 --> 32:06.625
Yeah, but I just looked up
how many people

32:06.658 --> 32:08.294
have metal-on-metal hips.

32:08.327 --> 32:09.928
It's well over a million.

32:09.962 --> 32:11.463
This is my industry.

32:11.497 --> 32:13.265
How do I not know
this is going on?

32:13.299 --> 32:16.335
It's impossible to know
everything we should know.

32:16.368 --> 32:19.105
All we can do
is the best we can.

32:29.348 --> 32:31.650
About earlier...

32:31.683 --> 32:33.919
There are no excuses
for what I did, so I...

32:33.952 --> 32:37.956
I pulled you into a dark room
and I threw my arms around you.

32:37.990 --> 32:40.426
I'd say that we share the blame.

32:40.459 --> 32:43.429
As far as I'm concerned,

32:43.462 --> 32:46.132
what happened never happened.

32:46.165 --> 32:47.666
Okay?

33:01.313 --> 33:03.049
Could have been worse.

33:04.650 --> 33:07.386
Not for John.

33:07.419 --> 33:10.222
Every medicine,
surgical procedure

33:10.256 --> 33:12.624
or intervention
ever prescribed or performed

33:12.658 --> 33:14.626
is because of a clinical trial.

33:14.660 --> 33:16.495
Without them,
medicine cannot advance.

33:16.528 --> 33:18.464
Without them...

33:18.497 --> 33:20.132
we'd still have polio.

33:20.166 --> 33:21.733
But does everyone
who volunteers--

33:21.767 --> 33:24.336
do they understand the risk?

33:24.370 --> 33:27.005
-They signed the forms.
-Because they're desperate.

33:27.039 --> 33:29.508
They needed the money.

33:29.541 --> 33:33.212
A student trying to pay
for his tuition,

33:33.245 --> 33:36.182
underpaid schoolteacher,

33:36.215 --> 33:38.884
recovering addict...

33:43.589 --> 33:46.058
...dad trying to provide
for his little girl.

33:46.092 --> 33:48.360
And now...

33:48.394 --> 33:50.796
that child has no father.

34:01.407 --> 34:03.375
Mrs. Losurdo.

34:03.409 --> 34:06.112
Is he okay?

34:06.145 --> 34:08.247
No, I... I-I want to see John.
How is he?

34:08.280 --> 34:10.682
Well, when we spoke earlier,
on the phone,

34:10.716 --> 34:14.052
John was already experiencing
serious side effects.

34:14.086 --> 34:17.022
And during the course
of the day, he worsened,

34:17.055 --> 34:20.526
and... although we did
everything we could,

34:20.559 --> 34:22.561
we were unable to save him.

34:22.594 --> 34:26.198
And he died a little while ago.

34:26.232 --> 34:27.699
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

34:27.733 --> 34:30.536
He was fine.
When you called me, he was fine.

34:30.569 --> 34:33.205
No, he was already in distress.

34:35.507 --> 34:37.776
Please, have a seat.
Have a seat.

34:39.678 --> 34:42.414
-I'm sorry.

34:49.855 --> 34:51.857
Mom?

35:07.273 --> 35:09.241
You know,
John always reminded me

35:09.275 --> 35:12.578
to be grateful for the people
that don't give up on us.

35:12.611 --> 35:15.247
Not every recovering addict

35:15.281 --> 35:17.449
has that person, but I do.

35:17.483 --> 35:21.387
And I am so grateful.

35:23.889 --> 35:27.159
When the phone rings
at night, Jess,

35:27.193 --> 35:30.529
my heart stops.

35:30.562 --> 35:32.364
Is it gonna be someone
calling to say

35:32.398 --> 35:33.832
that you're in trouble again

35:33.865 --> 35:37.203
or that you're in jail?

35:38.804 --> 35:39.871
Or dead?

35:41.072 --> 35:43.509
So I hover.

35:43.542 --> 35:45.477
And I worry.

35:45.511 --> 35:49.014
And, yes, I do too much,
but here we are again.

35:51.049 --> 35:53.719
You almost died today, Jess.

35:55.687 --> 35:58.357
You got to start
making better choices.

35:58.390 --> 36:01.727
I know.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.195
You're right.

36:03.229 --> 36:05.364
I promise I will try
to make sure

36:05.397 --> 36:08.567
this is the last time that you
have to go through this.

36:08.600 --> 36:12.204
So let's start now. Okay?

36:12.238 --> 36:14.039
Get out of here.

36:14.072 --> 36:16.408
Go sing and dance

36:16.442 --> 36:19.245
and do whatever
the hell you want.

36:19.278 --> 36:21.880
I'm safe.

36:21.913 --> 36:25.083
And I'm gonna be okay.

36:33.592 --> 36:35.561
-You're touching me.
-Mm-hmm.

36:35.594 --> 36:37.563
-And you're smiling.
-Ah. Which is more offensive

36:39.931 --> 36:41.567
I am guiding you toward victory.

36:41.600 --> 36:44.736
You put together
a team of doctors.

36:44.770 --> 36:46.572
You expertly stepped up
in the OR

36:46.605 --> 36:50.008
to repair
an exterior iliac artery.

36:50.041 --> 36:54.212
Mina, you saved Ernest's life.

36:54.246 --> 36:57.048
Now, we do what we do
for moments like this.

36:58.617 --> 37:01.019
So go ahead.
Finish the job, princess.

37:01.052 --> 37:02.454
-Don't call me princess.

37:10.762 --> 37:13.131
Ernest should make
a full recovery.

37:13.164 --> 37:16.468
In a few months, he may even get
his vision and hearing back.

37:16.502 --> 37:18.604
His mind will clear.

37:18.637 --> 37:20.706
He will barbecue again.

37:20.739 --> 37:22.874
I'm sorry you both
had to go through this,

37:22.908 --> 37:26.278
but it's over.

37:26.312 --> 37:28.980
Thank you.

37:36.855 --> 37:39.991
-Really, thank you.
-Oh, yes. Of course.

37:40.025 --> 37:41.993
Thank you.

37:50.035 --> 37:53.805
Hear us out: camping, rafting
isn't gonna happen

37:53.839 --> 37:56.241
because we all realized
we don't really raft,

37:56.274 --> 37:58.810
or do things outdoors that
involve water, animals or bugs.

37:58.844 --> 38:00.446
I'm not even certain I can swim.

38:00.479 --> 38:03.014
Well, I can swim, but spending
two hours in the car

38:03.048 --> 38:07.419
with this guy, after this day,
is not my idea of a good time.

38:07.453 --> 38:09.921
-So...
-Are you inviting yourselves
to girls' night?

38:09.955 --> 38:11.690
Well, we're hoping
to get invited.

38:11.723 --> 38:13.492
We'll be on our best behavior.

38:13.525 --> 38:16.428
What if I don't want
your best behavior?

38:16.462 --> 38:19.498
* Mailman, mailman *

38:19.531 --> 38:21.867
* Tell me what
you got for me... *

38:23.802 --> 38:27.539
What would you do if you were
no longer free to be a surgeon?

38:31.242 --> 38:33.211
Uh, I don't know really.

38:33.244 --> 38:35.714
Um...

38:35.747 --> 38:37.816
...a lumberjack?

38:37.849 --> 38:39.117
Well, I have
to cut up something.

38:41.086 --> 38:44.456
I miss the OR. I just think
about it all the time.

38:44.490 --> 38:46.057
You've been kicked upstairs.

38:46.091 --> 38:49.728
I moved myself upstairs,
and now it's just hell.

38:49.761 --> 38:51.062
I'm trying to get back down.

38:51.096 --> 38:52.297
Some days are better
than others.

38:52.330 --> 38:54.700
Today-- not one of them.

38:54.733 --> 38:57.035
Sense a bit of a crisis here.

38:57.068 --> 38:59.405
You know what would help?

39:00.606 --> 39:02.307
Buy a Porsche.

39:02.340 --> 39:03.709
It's parked outside.

39:03.742 --> 39:06.177
-Sailboat, then.
-Just sold it.

39:06.211 --> 39:08.947
High

39:11.349 --> 39:14.453
I won't judge.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.323
I like you.

39:18.356 --> 39:20.659
I like you.

39:20.692 --> 39:23.361
Even though you are
a bit of a bastard.

39:25.564 --> 39:27.699
Cheers.

39:27.733 --> 39:30.669
* Been looking
every which way... *

39:30.702 --> 39:34.773
* Making love
with each other, ah-ha *

39:34.806 --> 39:37.342
* Islands in the stream *

39:37.375 --> 39:40.211
-IRVING: Devon.
-* That is what we are *

39:40.245 --> 39:41.580
* No one in between *

39:41.613 --> 39:44.282
-Yeah! Let's go.
*

39:44.315 --> 39:46.685
-Let's go, Devon.
-* Sail away with me *

39:46.718 --> 39:49.555
* To another world *

39:49.588 --> 39:52.558
* And we rely on each other,
ah-ha *

39:52.591 --> 39:54.926
You look...

39:54.960 --> 39:58.964
Like I just had one
of the worst days of my life?

39:58.997 --> 40:01.066
I was gonna say "amazing."

40:01.099 --> 40:03.902
With a good outcome for Jessie.

40:03.935 --> 40:05.604
This time.

40:05.637 --> 40:07.272
* If the love was gone... *

40:07.305 --> 40:08.707
Come back to me, Mina.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.141
I hate working alone.

40:10.175 --> 40:12.210
-You are never alone in the OR.
-Yeah, well,

40:12.243 --> 40:13.378
without you, I am.

40:13.411 --> 40:16.214
Say it.

40:16.247 --> 40:19.117
-You are irreplaceable.
-Mm-mmm.

40:19.150 --> 40:21.319
Mm, mm-mmm.
Use the bass in your voice.

40:21.352 --> 40:23.154
Say it like you mean it.

40:25.957 --> 40:29.294
You... are...

40:29.327 --> 40:30.996
irreplaceable.

40:32.263 --> 40:33.465
I'll work with you

40:33.499 --> 40:36.401
and Dr. Voss.

40:36.434 --> 40:39.505
I get to choose the surgeries.
And I get to cut.

40:39.538 --> 40:42.340
The queen has spoken.

40:42.373 --> 40:43.742
The king bows down.

40:43.775 --> 40:45.744
You are no king,

40:45.777 --> 40:47.746
and I am not your queen.

40:47.779 --> 40:50.549
-I am your mentee.
-No.

40:51.717 --> 40:52.984
You are my partner.

40:59.958 --> 41:02.427
Speech!

41:02.460 --> 41:04.596
Yes.

41:04.630 --> 41:07.465
Everybody having
a good time tonight?

41:10.836 --> 41:14.472
I hope so, because it is
a really great chance

41:14.506 --> 41:17.843
to practice the wedding dance.
What do you all think?

41:17.876 --> 41:19.310
-Let's do it!

41:20.478 --> 41:23.048
And, thankfully, a dancer

41:23.081 --> 41:25.116
who is way better than me helped
me put this thing together,

41:25.150 --> 41:27.385
-and that is Julian Booth.

41:27.418 --> 41:29.354
Let's do this!

41:32.591 --> 41:33.925
Follow along.

41:37.362 --> 41:40.498
-You got it.

41:49.507 --> 41:51.509
*

42:02.520 --> 42:04.489
All right!

42:04.522 --> 42:07.025
*

42:18.369 --> 42:19.605
Yeah!

42:28.914 --> 42:31.717
That was... that was tough.

42:32.584 --> 42:33.919
But amazing.

42:33.952 --> 42:35.721
It really was.

42:36.755 --> 42:40.391
Thank you.

42:40.425 --> 42:43.629
* The garbageman left
all the trash... *

42:43.662 --> 42:47.298
I guess, uh, it's a bad idea
for us to dance.

42:47.332 --> 42:50.135
Just for tonight.
Last dance.

42:50.168 --> 42:54.072
* And the hinges fell
off of the gate *

42:57.976 --> 43:00.411
* And this morning
at breakfast *

43:02.180 --> 43:05.150
* Spilled all the coffee *

43:05.183 --> 43:09.788
* And I opened the door
on my knee *

43:13.324 --> 43:17.162
* Oh, the last thing
I needed *

43:18.797 --> 43:22.768
* The first thing this morning *

43:22.801 --> 43:27.272
* Was to have
you walk out on me. *

44:11.049 --> 44:13.018
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

44:15.486 --> 44:17.222
You survived your shift
with The Resident.

44:17.255 --> 44:19.825
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:22.227 --> 44:23.428
Buckle up, buttercup.

44:25.764 --> 44:28.133
It's real, and it pulls
people together.

44:28.166 --> 44:31.703
-* We're breaking waves
shooting star *

44:31.737 --> 44:35.306
* We live for glory
not forever *

44:35.340 --> 44:36.341
MAN: Touchdown!

44:36.374 --> 44:39.911
* Reach out *

44:39.945 --> 44:43.548
* Make this right here
right now *

44:43.581 --> 44:46.517
* Stand up *

44:47.385 --> 44:49.154
* Here right now *

44:49.187 --> 44:51.056
That sounds like fun.
