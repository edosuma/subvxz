01:04.730 --> 01:05.607
Kiki, come on!

01:06.191 --> 01:08.569
I gotta return
this outfit tomorrow. Calm down.

01:31.842 --> 01:33.343
Calm down! Calm down, man!

02:58.303 --> 03:00.222
I came up seeing a lot.

03:00.305 --> 03:03.350
My dad. His drug buddies.

03:04.393 --> 03:06.895
But I ain't never seen anything like that.

03:06.978 --> 03:08.146
Break it down.

03:11.108 --> 03:13.944
It was like they just came at each other.

03:15.153 --> 03:18.532
Wild eyes. Chomping teeth.

03:19.241 --> 03:22.077
It was like that bath salts stuff
you hear about.

03:23.161 --> 03:26.164
It wasn't coke? Heroin? PCP?

03:26.248 --> 03:29.418
No. None of my friends get down like that.

03:29.501 --> 03:31.628
And I wouldn't have them over if they did.

03:31.711 --> 03:32.921
Real talk.

03:33.004 --> 03:35.674
These kids were from Harlem,
but we didn't know 'em like that.

03:36.550 --> 03:39.678
Girl practically ripped out
the side of Tisha's neck.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.013
What you gonna do about it?

03:42.723 --> 03:44.349
I'mma try and shut it down.

03:44.975 --> 03:46.601
First I gotta know where it came from.

03:46.685 --> 03:49.438
Bushmaster? It's everywhere.

03:51.440 --> 03:52.983
I gotta go open up the shop.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.694
But you need to handle this shit, Luke.

03:56.695 --> 03:58.947
My bad.

04:15.172 --> 04:18.716
Bushmaster's name is on the package.
He's gotta be behind it.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.386
A while ago,
it was my name on that package.

04:22.512 --> 04:23.889
That's different.

04:23.972 --> 04:26.516
Bushmaster's about that life. You ain't.

04:27.267 --> 04:31.480
Stylers? Drugs? I'm not feeling it.

04:31.563 --> 04:33.607
They bogarted all them grow houses, man.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.692
Yeah, for nightshade.
Not for distribution.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.360
Look, who cares?

04:37.444 --> 04:41.239
Except for the Stokes, all these fools
are neck-deep in the drug game, okay?

04:41.323 --> 04:45.410
They're guilty as sin.
You should force all of them to use some.

04:46.328 --> 04:49.247
- What's with you, man?
- You didn't see what I saw.

04:50.582 --> 04:52.584
Plus my girl almost got hurt.

04:53.710 --> 04:54.878
No.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.963
No, man, it ain't okay.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.009
What's the word, Sug?

05:01.092 --> 05:02.427
It ain't Shabba.

05:02.511 --> 05:03.678
It's Satan's niece.

05:04.221 --> 05:06.306
Mariah's in bed with the Chinese.

05:06.389 --> 05:09.100
My people saw Oldboy up in her office.

05:09.184 --> 05:12.020
She probably gave him the green light
to sell that poison up in Harlem,

05:12.103 --> 05:13.605
in exchange for points on the package.

05:13.688 --> 05:16.107
Yeah, which is why
she calls it Bushmaster.

05:16.191 --> 05:17.859
To drag his name through the mud.

05:17.943 --> 05:19.861
It's just another way to force him out.

05:19.945 --> 05:22.197
Even if it doesn't work,
it tarnishes his name in Harlem.

05:22.781 --> 05:24.908
My whole life,
the Stokes stayed out of the drug game.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.076
Different Stokes.

05:26.159 --> 05:29.579
Nah, same Stokes. Ain't none of 'em shit.

05:30.580 --> 05:31.832
How you wanna play this?

05:31.915 --> 05:33.333
Couldn't Misty do something?

05:33.416 --> 05:36.419
No, no, no. She can't. Not fully.

05:36.503 --> 05:38.338
New crimes call for new laws.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.966
All cops have are handcuffs and excuses.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.344
You know where
the Chinese do their processing?

05:44.427 --> 05:46.513
I could holler at some of the drivers.

05:47.138 --> 05:50.976
You do this business long enough,
everybody knows everybody.

05:51.059 --> 05:53.895
Good. Holler at 'em.

05:53.979 --> 05:56.648
- I'll take care of the rest.
- You got it.

06:09.995 --> 06:12.831
And we come
to this beautiful Romare Bearden.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.791
An American treasure. Vibrant.

06:14.874 --> 06:16.835
Quite the catch, since it's been decades

06:16.918 --> 06:20.213
since a Bearden original
has found its way to the market.

06:20.297 --> 06:22.799
Ah... Two million to open it.

06:22.882 --> 06:23.925
Good morning.

06:24.009 --> 06:26.678
Two point five over here.
Three million?

06:26.761 --> 06:30.015
Thank you for joining me
on such short notice.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.559
The last time you called a meeting,

06:32.642 --> 06:34.352
my brother Peter got a bullet to the head.

06:34.436 --> 06:39.274
Oh, good Lord.
Diamondback was a plague on us all.

06:39.357 --> 06:40.942
Now it's Bushmaster.

06:41.026 --> 06:43.820
Funny how all these plagues
begin and end with you.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.489
Are you calling me God?

06:47.574 --> 06:49.534
Calling you a pebble in my shoe.

06:49.618 --> 06:52.829
$6.5 million. Sold. Well done to you, sir.

06:52.912 --> 06:56.833
The Stylers are done.
And I am the one who did them.

06:57.334 --> 07:00.337
This whole United Nations idea of yours
isn't gonna work

07:00.420 --> 07:02.130
as long as Bushmaster is still out there.

07:02.213 --> 07:06.217
Ms. Stokes and I have plans in motion
to eliminate our problem,

07:06.968 --> 07:09.095
so this collective will thrive.

07:09.179 --> 07:10.847
I don't even know
why we need it.

07:10.931 --> 07:15.644
The Italians, the Chinese, the Japanese
have been running networks for centuries.

07:16.645 --> 07:20.273
Blacks are the only ones
who can't keep themselves organized.

07:20.357 --> 07:21.691
<i>Tempi cambi.</i>

07:23.109 --> 07:25.820
That's your weakness, Carbone.

07:25.904 --> 07:27.906
You've always kept yourselves isolated.

07:27.989 --> 07:31.368
A wonderful addition
to any serious aficionado's collection.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.371
Bidding starts at $5 million.

07:34.454 --> 07:37.457
There are bigger profits
in an open exchange.

07:37.540 --> 07:39.751
World trade, so to speak.

07:39.834 --> 07:41.962
Harlem is the gateway.

07:42.045 --> 07:45.298
Plenty of customers
for whatever you are offering,

07:45.382 --> 07:49.970
and increasing real estate opportunities
to wash the profits.

07:51.346 --> 07:53.014
But you'll be in charge.

07:53.932 --> 07:56.059
It's my black face on the money.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.520
But it's still green.

07:58.603 --> 08:03.024
My legitimate access to legal,
social and political assets

08:03.108 --> 08:04.985
will be advantageous to us all.

08:05.068 --> 08:09.781
I am willing to open
the wall around Harlem for...

08:10.323 --> 08:12.158
specific access.

08:13.952 --> 08:15.495
Of course, there's a price...

08:15.912 --> 08:18.581
Twenty-five million dollars. Last chance.

08:19.958 --> 08:22.043
Sold! Congratulations, sir.

08:22.627 --> 08:25.338
I adore this place.

08:26.339 --> 08:29.551
It's a cathedral to power and privilege.

08:29.634 --> 08:30.719
And here it is,

08:30.802 --> 08:34.722
from the private collection
of Mariah Dillard's,

08:34.806 --> 08:39.184
the first galley of W.E.B. Du Bois'
<i>The Souls Of Black Folk,</i>

08:39.269 --> 08:42.605
produced in 1902, published in 1903.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.108
With Mr. Du Bois's very own
handwritten corrections

08:45.191 --> 08:47.485
and line alterations in the margin.

08:47.569 --> 08:50.572
- Bidding starts at two million.
- Since we're practically in church,

08:50.655 --> 08:53.491
I think it's fitting
that you make an offering.

08:54.826 --> 08:57.620
I suggest you start bidding quickly.

08:57.704 --> 09:00.790
Or just Yangsi Gonshi
will have access to Harlem.

09:01.833 --> 09:02.834
Four million?

09:03.585 --> 09:07.130
Four point five? Four point five?
Any advance from four point five?

09:07.213 --> 09:09.716
The book is just a place holder.

09:09.799 --> 09:11.426
Legitimize this.

09:11.509 --> 09:13.136
I expect it back.

09:14.304 --> 09:15.388
Untouched.

09:18.683 --> 09:19.934
That went well.

09:20.810 --> 09:21.895
Nicely done.

09:22.687 --> 09:24.355
As for our other problem,

09:24.439 --> 09:27.233
my security team suspects
he's watching us.

09:27.317 --> 09:28.485
Oh, hopefully so.

09:28.568 --> 09:31.154
That's the whole point
of putting cheese in a rat trap.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.727
You still holding
that silly-ass theory?

10:03.603 --> 10:05.897
That guilty men sleep? Absolutely.

10:05.980 --> 10:08.358
Look at him. He's resting up.

10:11.194 --> 10:12.946
Our 24 hours is running out.

10:14.739 --> 10:17.700
He just wants Mariah locked up
so he can take over.

10:17.784 --> 10:21.955
You take away a player's queen,
the game is pretty much won.

10:22.038 --> 10:24.374
There's a rub. Queen-for-a-day proffer.

10:25.708 --> 10:28.128
We risk never being able
to prosecute Mr. Alvarez

10:28.211 --> 10:30.130
on any of the crimes
that he discloses to us.

10:30.213 --> 10:31.631
Including capital crimes.

10:32.215 --> 10:37.512
With his cooperation, we can finally
get Mariah in handcuffs.

10:37.595 --> 10:40.265
We could get closure on Candace Miller.

10:41.683 --> 10:44.602
And we get to the bottom
of who killed Ridenhour.

10:44.686 --> 10:46.396
It's worth it, Priscilla.

10:48.189 --> 10:50.900
- You just want your pound of flesh.
- You don't?

10:54.237 --> 10:55.780
I remember Mr. Alvarez.

10:56.489 --> 10:57.699
Quite well.

10:59.701 --> 11:01.161
I'll call the A.U.S.A.

11:01.244 --> 11:03.246
Feds are the only ones
who can make a proffer.

11:03.329 --> 11:07.750
And with all the gun connections,
it should be easy to build a federal case.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.296
No doubt.

11:12.881 --> 11:14.048
Let's do it.

11:31.190 --> 11:33.067
Show me the goods!

11:49.209 --> 11:51.252
You want to use my name?

11:52.378 --> 11:56.049
Huh? Puttin' that poison on the streets
like it's me, huh?

11:56.132 --> 12:00.470
Mariah was right.
Rats always follow the cheese.

12:06.309 --> 12:07.727
Make it swiss!

12:07.810 --> 12:09.854
Now! Now, now!

12:10.939 --> 12:11.898
Bushmaster!

12:16.778 --> 12:18.071
Stay behind me.

12:41.469 --> 12:43.638
Stop shooting, you idiots!

12:46.182 --> 12:50.645
Hey. We do this my way.
You kill anybody, you're on your own.

12:51.813 --> 12:52.814
Okay.

13:20.049 --> 13:21.551
Hey, what'd I say?

14:08.264 --> 14:12.727
You realize
Mariah is behind all this, yeah?

14:13.311 --> 14:14.937
All to destroy my name.

14:16.981 --> 14:18.483
You must protect your name.

14:18.566 --> 14:21.903
Yeah. That's about the first thing
you and I agreed on.

14:21.986 --> 14:23.988
Poisoning the children.

14:24.072 --> 14:26.532
Now you see why Babylon must burn.

14:26.616 --> 14:28.576
First them. Then her.

14:28.659 --> 14:29.827
Why don't you kill each other,

14:29.911 --> 14:31.829
get it over with
so I can get some goddamn sleep?

14:33.164 --> 14:34.582
How many more people have to die?

14:34.665 --> 14:38.211
Anyone who gets in the way. Anyone.

14:38.836 --> 14:40.880
I used one of these before.

14:41.631 --> 14:43.091
You might want to leave.

14:44.008 --> 14:47.136
I'm not letting you burn the evidence.
Or them.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.971
You don't have a choice.

14:57.939 --> 14:59.440
Sweet Christmas.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.756
Rassclaat.

15:23.840 --> 15:27.009
Hey. I'm sorry I've been away so long.

15:28.886 --> 15:31.597
You know,
I've never felt normal a day in my life.

15:32.598 --> 15:35.768
Between the Dillards and the Stokes,
I never felt really accepted.

15:36.978 --> 15:40.940
I loved the Johnsons,
but I was always Mariah's.

15:42.525 --> 15:45.403
You were the only Stokes
that I could actually count on.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.531
Oh, I remember your laugh.

15:51.909 --> 15:55.621
You introduced me to Nina, Stevie,

15:55.705 --> 15:58.416
Sly, Curtis...

15:59.000 --> 16:00.710
Bought me my first Casio.

16:03.004 --> 16:07.633
"Play what you feel inside, baby girl.
Play what you got inside.

16:09.385 --> 16:11.220
Your song is your truth."

16:16.350 --> 16:17.518
I wanted to.

16:19.520 --> 16:20.730
I really did.

16:23.024 --> 16:26.027
But I was always afraid
of what I might find inside.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.948
And now I know I was right to be afraid.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.246
I am the product of rape.

16:39.957 --> 16:42.793
Incest. Murder.

16:46.047 --> 16:48.424
Stokes twice over.

16:53.137 --> 16:54.263
You knew that.

16:56.390 --> 17:00.853
You saw Pete's face and his eyes in mine,
and you still loved me anyway.

17:04.232 --> 17:05.608
I thank you for that.

17:09.654 --> 17:10.820
Thank you, cousin.

17:12.114 --> 17:13.491
Thank you always.

17:21.082 --> 17:22.583
I know who I am now.

17:24.835 --> 17:26.671
Deep down who I've always been.

17:30.841 --> 17:32.677
Knowing changes everything.

17:36.597 --> 17:37.723
Mariah!

17:48.609 --> 17:51.028
I need to introduce you to Dapper Dan.

17:52.613 --> 17:53.906
Oh, I know Dap.

17:54.532 --> 17:56.826
The last Dap suit I had,
your cousin messed up.

17:58.035 --> 18:00.371
My clothes always end up like this.

18:00.454 --> 18:01.455
I'm used to it.

18:01.539 --> 18:02.748
Hmm.

18:03.666 --> 18:04.750
No, thanks.

18:05.501 --> 18:07.336
I never drink when I'm on duty.

18:08.838 --> 18:11.632
You know that drug lab
you went in on with the Chinese?

18:12.592 --> 18:13.843
I just shut it down.

18:15.261 --> 18:20.016
I'll admit, slapping Bushmaster's name
on those packages was genius.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.310
Worked when Arturo did it to me, too.

18:23.019 --> 18:24.437
You know what they say.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.230
We live and die by our rep.

18:26.981 --> 18:29.859
I have no idea what you're talking about.

18:39.994 --> 18:43.914
I don't care how many allies
you think you have, Black Mariah.

18:44.999 --> 18:46.417
Yeah.

18:46.500 --> 18:49.378
Your nickname is starting to ring true.

18:50.671 --> 18:52.340
Bushmaster's coming for you.

18:53.007 --> 18:54.884
These little punks can't protect you.

18:55.843 --> 18:59.013
I have always lived my life in opposition.

19:00.431 --> 19:02.767
Tell me something new, hero.

19:02.850 --> 19:05.978
I saved you twice.
I won't do it a third time.

19:07.229 --> 19:10.816
There ain't no deception
like self-deception.

19:16.530 --> 19:20.201
I learned something
that night at the Alamo,

19:20.993 --> 19:24.080
when your daddy showed me
your high school pictures.

19:25.456 --> 19:28.501
You are still just a goofy kid.

19:30.211 --> 19:35.549
You have no idea what to do
with your beautiful powers.

19:36.967 --> 19:38.427
Let me guess.

19:38.511 --> 19:41.013
You have a better idea
of what to do with my powers.

19:41.097 --> 19:44.308
Oh, baby, I'm already doing it
with just half your gifts.

19:46.268 --> 19:48.729
Of course, you're going to save me.

19:50.815 --> 19:53.943
You are my dark chocolate Boy Scout.

19:54.985 --> 19:57.613
It's what I love about our relationship.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.240
There is no relationship.

20:00.116 --> 20:01.409
I hate you.

20:02.076 --> 20:04.537
It's the hate that makes it great.

20:08.165 --> 20:11.085
I used to daydream about how to kill you.

20:12.962 --> 20:14.463
Drown you.

20:14.547 --> 20:15.798
Poison you.

20:16.757 --> 20:18.134
Burn you.

20:21.679 --> 20:23.556
Break your heart.

20:27.017 --> 20:28.394
So foolish.

20:30.813 --> 20:33.816
I didn't appreciate
what was right in front of me.

20:36.527 --> 20:37.528
Yeah?

20:38.571 --> 20:39.739
And what's that?

20:45.035 --> 20:49.707
You're the only man
I've ever been able to count on.

20:53.669 --> 20:54.962
Harlem, too.

20:56.630 --> 20:59.467
You are a real man of the people.

21:01.177 --> 21:02.803
The real thing.

21:04.305 --> 21:05.931
That's your weakness.

21:09.310 --> 21:11.562
It's poetic, actually.

21:32.249 --> 21:33.626
Things change.

21:42.802 --> 21:46.263
I just decided
that I'm not on duty anymore.

21:49.475 --> 21:53.437
Wow, this Bushmaster Rum is really good.

21:56.232 --> 21:59.652
I'll pour some out
when you two are done with each other.

22:23.717 --> 22:25.594
Maxine. Mariah.

22:27.805 --> 22:30.182
Get Kris Parker on the phone.

22:30.891 --> 22:33.018
Yeah. Spread the word.

22:33.102 --> 22:36.272
Free concert. A unity jam.

22:37.022 --> 22:40.234
The Paradise has to be packed-out tonight.

22:41.485 --> 22:43.821
From the windows to the walls.

22:44.738 --> 22:47.116
Gotta be hot to death.

22:52.496 --> 22:53.831
Looks good on our end.

22:54.999 --> 22:57.334
Make sure your client understands
that if he lies,

22:57.418 --> 23:00.170
or leaves anything out of his statement,
the proffer becomes void.

23:00.254 --> 23:03.299
And he could be charged
with anything he admitted here today.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.967
I get it.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.468
It ain't my first rodeo.

23:24.153 --> 23:26.989
State your name and date of birth
for the record.

23:27.072 --> 23:30.284
Hernan Enrique Salazar Alvarez.

23:31.410 --> 23:36.832
Born May 11th, 1977,
in Ponce, Puerto Rico.

23:39.001 --> 23:41.962
And you are making this confession
of your own free will?

23:42.713 --> 23:43.714
I am.

23:43.797 --> 23:47.760
Witnessing this confession
is your attorney, Patricia Wilson,

23:48.636 --> 23:55.100
A.U.S.A. Colin Dunbar and myself,
Detective Mercedes Knight.

23:57.353 --> 23:59.605
My last year in Seagate,

24:00.356 --> 24:03.817
me and Comanche got paid
by this juiced-in guard, Rackham,

24:03.901 --> 24:07.071
to beat the shit
out of some guy named Carl Lucas.

24:07.154 --> 24:10.074
We broke him down, Billy Batts style.

24:10.866 --> 24:12.117
Lucas should've died.

24:12.826 --> 24:16.705
But some shady-ass prison doctor
did an experiment,

24:16.789 --> 24:18.457
and he came out bulletproof.

24:18.540 --> 24:21.794
Smashed his way out of jail
with his bare hands.

24:22.795 --> 24:25.255
And now he calls himself Luke Cage.

24:26.173 --> 24:27.758
Ain't that some shit?

24:27.841 --> 24:29.969
What does that have to do
with Mariah Dillard?

24:30.052 --> 24:31.136
Relax.

24:32.388 --> 24:33.597
I'm gonna get there.

24:35.891 --> 24:39.144
<i>Yo, yo, yo citizens.
What's up, man? This just in.</i>

24:39.228 --> 24:43.148
<i>There's a concert at Harlem's Paradise
tonight. One night only.</i>

24:43.232 --> 24:46.276
<i>The one and only Blastmaster, KRS-One.</i>

24:46.360 --> 24:47.945
<i>It's a unity jam, Heather B.</i>

24:48.028 --> 24:51.281
<i>Sponsored by the Family First Initiative
and Bushmaster Rum.</i>

24:51.365 --> 24:53.617
<i>Hold up. "Bushmaster"?</i>

24:53.701 --> 24:55.953
<i>Ain't that the crazy drug that got people</i>

24:56.036 --> 24:58.956
<i>runnin' around here trippin'
and losing their mind?</i>

24:59.039 --> 25:03.043
<i>Nah, nah, nah, I thought it was
the dude who knocked out Luke Cage.</i>

25:03.127 --> 25:03.961
<i>You going?</i>

25:04.044 --> 25:05.921
<i>Yeah, I'll probably still go.</i>

25:10.759 --> 25:12.219
- Ya miss me?
- No.

25:13.846 --> 25:15.222
- Liar.
- Hey.

25:15.806 --> 25:17.975
You must hear
what she got to say.

25:18.058 --> 25:21.020
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go on. Tell your story.

25:24.857 --> 25:27.067
After I left you, I went to see my mother.

25:27.151 --> 25:29.153
I had to look her in her eye.

25:29.236 --> 25:30.362
And what happened?

25:32.072 --> 25:34.074
She didn't just give the order.

25:34.783 --> 25:37.453
She lit the fire
that burned your uncle alive.

25:38.746 --> 25:41.081
Why did you come tell me this, huh?

25:41.165 --> 25:43.751
Why did you deliver yourself to the lion?

25:43.834 --> 25:46.670
Because I need that lion
to maul my mother.

25:52.801 --> 25:55.679
You want me to kill her for you?

25:55.763 --> 25:57.181
Not for me.

25:57.264 --> 25:58.640
For everyone.

25:58.724 --> 26:00.225
The woman is a virus.

26:00.309 --> 26:03.020
She infiltrates, destroys,
and moves on to the next.

26:03.103 --> 26:05.773
You can't treat her.
You can't quarantine her.

26:06.482 --> 26:07.775
She won't stop.

26:09.818 --> 26:13.906
Hmm. I don't need a motivation
to kill your mother.

26:13.989 --> 26:15.949
I need opportunity.

26:16.033 --> 26:21.205
And right now, she's fortified herself
inside the castle. So...

26:22.081 --> 26:24.208
So, I can get you inside the club.

26:25.918 --> 26:29.296
There's secret passageways
underneath from back in Prohibition.

26:29.379 --> 26:32.049
I used to play in them when I would visit.

26:34.343 --> 26:35.969
And even if I get inside,

26:37.638 --> 26:39.681
she's still got plenty of protection.

26:40.849 --> 26:42.726
That is why...

26:45.103 --> 26:46.480
you'll need a secret weapon.

26:46.563 --> 26:47.856
What is it?

26:48.440 --> 26:49.942
A supershot of nightshade.

26:50.025 --> 26:51.735
Hmm.

26:51.819 --> 26:53.320
It could double your strength.

26:53.403 --> 26:54.822
And the cost?

26:55.447 --> 26:56.657
You need to be careful.

26:57.574 --> 26:59.618
Whatever you do,
don't take it all at once.

26:59.701 --> 27:03.247
It can destroy your body and your mind.

27:04.665 --> 27:07.960
No, no, no. Rhaatid!
It's not worth the cost.

27:08.043 --> 27:09.795
- It's not worth the risk.
- Hey, hey, hey.

27:11.547 --> 27:14.424
For my mother, for my father,

27:15.467 --> 27:16.677
for Anansi,

27:18.053 --> 27:19.304
for my grandfather.

27:20.180 --> 27:21.598
All the people...

27:25.435 --> 27:26.520
It's worth it.

27:39.408 --> 27:40.909
And what about Chico?

27:40.993 --> 27:44.746
Did you guys shoot up Pop's Barber Shop
to get to him?

27:46.874 --> 27:48.667
There's rules to this shit.

27:50.294 --> 27:51.879
Pop's was Switzerland.

27:53.463 --> 27:54.965
Everybody loved him.

27:56.508 --> 28:00.888
One of Cottonmouth's guys,
Tone, was reckless.

28:01.805 --> 28:04.057
When he found out Chico was there,
he lit the place up.

28:13.567 --> 28:15.235
I couldn't stop him in time.

28:17.571 --> 28:19.948
It mentions, uh, Luke Cage was there.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.366
He was present?

28:21.450 --> 28:22.784
Yeah.

28:22.868 --> 28:24.161
Incognito.

28:24.953 --> 28:27.831
He, uh, shielded some kid or something.

28:29.625 --> 28:32.085
That kid was my son.

28:33.879 --> 28:35.797
Well, then you should be ecstatic.

28:36.548 --> 28:40.928
Cottonmouth was so pissed off
with Pop's death

28:41.762 --> 28:43.472
that he took that punk, Tone,

28:43.555 --> 28:46.350
and threw him off the roof
of Harlem's Paradise.

28:47.267 --> 28:51.521
He screamed all the way down
like a little bitch.

28:52.814 --> 28:54.399
That shit was perfect.

28:55.901 --> 28:58.153
I have to recuse myself from this case.

28:59.404 --> 29:03.367
Mr. Alvarez, you are a piece of garbage.

29:04.826 --> 29:06.662
I hope you burn in hell.

29:07.246 --> 29:09.706
Is my proffer still good?

29:12.501 --> 29:13.543
Yes.

29:14.127 --> 29:16.004
Then I don't need your sorry ass.

29:16.922 --> 29:17.923
Bounce.

29:18.715 --> 29:20.884
Don't let that door hit you.

29:27.516 --> 29:28.684
Where was I?

29:33.897 --> 29:36.275
Yo, you heard
about the unity concert tonight?

29:37.401 --> 29:40.654
Yo. I can't front, sounds kind of dope!

29:40.737 --> 29:41.822
I kind of wanna go.

29:41.905 --> 29:43.323
Yeah. That's on me.

29:43.407 --> 29:44.408
How?

29:44.491 --> 29:46.743
I went by Harlem's Paradise

29:46.827 --> 29:49.288
to tell Mariah
that I was done protecting her.

29:49.371 --> 29:51.331
That I was going
to let Bushmaster get her.

29:51.415 --> 29:52.833
And what does she do?

29:52.916 --> 29:54.835
She throws a massive free concert.

29:54.918 --> 29:57.629
Yep, niggas can't resist anything free.

29:57.713 --> 30:00.632
Yo, maybe she's trying
to party like it's 1999.

30:00.716 --> 30:04.052
No. More like she's trying to surround
herself with collateral damage.

30:04.136 --> 30:07.264
So if Bushmaster attacks, I'll be forced
to show up and protect Harlem.

30:07.347 --> 30:10.100
And Mariah by default. That's jacked-up.

30:13.603 --> 30:14.604
Man.

30:15.647 --> 30:18.775
I am so sick of this shit.

30:20.235 --> 30:22.487
It's always rinse and repeat with her.

30:23.655 --> 30:26.450
If it isn't Bushmaster, it's someone else.

30:27.951 --> 30:30.245
Always comes back to Mariah.

30:30.329 --> 30:31.663
Yo, don't take it personal, yo.

30:31.747 --> 30:33.290
It's always personal, man!

30:33.957 --> 30:36.668
Pop, Candace, Piranha.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.421
All those people at Gwen's.

30:42.049 --> 30:44.176
I even lost Claire behind this shit.

30:50.432 --> 30:51.683
It's just...

30:52.976 --> 30:55.437
It's all those fires you have to put out.

30:57.481 --> 30:58.857
<i>Staying ready.</i>

31:00.859 --> 31:04.071
<i>Always on edge at every moment.</i>

31:05.739 --> 31:08.200
<i>It does something to you
to live your life that way.</i>

31:08.283 --> 31:09.534
<i>Changes you.</i>

31:10.702 --> 31:12.245
<i>Claire saw it.</i>

31:12.329 --> 31:14.414
<i>She tried to warn me, but I just...</i>

31:15.540 --> 31:18.251
<i>I just couldn't hear it.</i>

31:18.835 --> 31:20.212
<i>So she bounced.</i>

31:21.546 --> 31:23.090
<i>And I don't blame her.</i>

31:23.173 --> 31:24.299
<i>I chose this life.</i>

31:27.928 --> 31:29.513
<i>I mean, I love Harlem.</i>

31:30.180 --> 31:31.181
<i>I do.</i>

31:32.432 --> 31:34.101
<i>But Mariah, she's...</i>

31:34.935 --> 31:36.061
<i>she's...</i>

31:38.480 --> 31:40.524
<i>If I protect her tomorrow,</i>

31:40.607 --> 31:43.193
<i>the next day she will just destroy
someone else's life.</i>

31:43.276 --> 31:44.611
<i>So sit this one out.</i>

31:44.694 --> 31:46.113
<i>Yo, come on, fam.</i>

31:46.196 --> 31:48.865
<i>How he gonna sit this one out?
He's Luke Cage.</i>

31:54.538 --> 31:56.623
I was on my way there
to kill him myself.

31:56.706 --> 31:57.916
Mariah beat me to it.

31:57.999 --> 32:01.420
I get there right as she picked up
the mic stand and bashed his head in.

32:03.296 --> 32:06.550
You know... I can't front.
I was proud of her.

32:07.217 --> 32:09.761
Candace Miller witnessed the crime, too?

32:12.013 --> 32:14.766
Oh, yeah. Candace.

32:16.059 --> 32:18.645
That was her name.

32:20.021 --> 32:23.525
We paid her 50 Gs to say Luke Cage did it.

32:23.608 --> 32:27.404
I used Luke's dish-washing gloves
from the kitchen for the DNA frame.

32:27.487 --> 32:29.698
It would've worked out perfect.

32:31.032 --> 32:34.828
But... Cage whooped Diamondback's ass,

32:34.911 --> 32:38.790
and, uh, Candace broke her silence.

32:40.125 --> 32:41.460
Y'all had Mariah.

32:42.544 --> 32:44.337
I had to get her out somehow.

32:45.589 --> 32:47.215
You used my phone.

32:48.425 --> 32:50.469
You dropped it
at the barber shop.

32:53.555 --> 32:56.683
I texted that girl as you

32:57.517 --> 32:59.269
to get her to meet me.

33:01.396 --> 33:03.482
Standing out front of the bodega.

33:05.108 --> 33:07.235
All tentative.

33:10.155 --> 33:11.531
Looked like an angel.

33:14.659 --> 33:16.328
Came up behind her slow...

33:17.621 --> 33:18.830
but steady.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.959
Sunday morning casual on a Friday night.

33:25.545 --> 33:28.298
The gun. What about the gun?

33:29.049 --> 33:30.592
Pearl-handled .38.

33:32.928 --> 33:35.388
Same gun that was used to kill this man.

33:39.726 --> 33:41.019
That wasn't me.

33:42.229 --> 33:44.022
Mariah shot him.

33:44.105 --> 33:45.815
After she lit him on fire.

33:47.692 --> 33:49.528
Jesus! Die already!

33:51.655 --> 33:53.490
Man, that guy wouldn't stop screaming.

33:54.324 --> 33:56.535
That's all I heard.

33:58.954 --> 34:00.622
Hey, let me get some water.

35:23.288 --> 35:24.497
Ridenhour.

35:26.249 --> 35:28.627
Comanche shot Ridenhour. That wasn't me.

35:28.710 --> 35:30.003
What happened?

35:31.421 --> 35:32.922
You know what happened.

35:33.965 --> 35:35.967
I need it in your words.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.447
We knew we had a snitch.

35:58.531 --> 36:01.660
Ridenhour slipped up
when he questioned Mariah.

36:01.743 --> 36:03.703
He knew about Tone going off the roof.

36:04.621 --> 36:06.539
Nobody else knew about that,

36:06.623 --> 36:10.710
except Mariah, myself,
Cottonmouth, Turk and Comanche.

36:11.419 --> 36:12.796
It had to be him,

36:14.130 --> 36:16.049
because I trusted him with it.

36:20.220 --> 36:21.846
I got the drop on 'em both.

36:23.723 --> 36:25.183
Che panicked.

36:26.935 --> 36:30.021
And when his lies stopped working,
he shot Ridenhour.

36:31.981 --> 36:34.067
And he started hustling backwards,

36:35.694 --> 36:37.487
but I knew he was the snitch.

36:39.906 --> 36:41.324
So I kneeled down...

36:42.992 --> 36:44.494
I took Ridenhour's gun...

36:46.287 --> 36:47.205
Gut shot.

36:51.292 --> 36:53.002
I should have let him bleed out.

36:56.047 --> 36:58.466
But I didn't want
to watch my friend suffer.

37:03.555 --> 37:05.890
The .38, Hernan?

37:06.808 --> 37:09.644
The pearl-handled .38

37:09.728 --> 37:13.189
<i>that killed Anansi, Candace,</i>

37:13.273 --> 37:15.483
and Pistol Pete Stokes.

37:20.739 --> 37:22.031
Ah.

37:22.115 --> 37:23.992
You didn't know about that one.

37:25.285 --> 37:27.662
I knew I should have tossed that gun.

37:30.248 --> 37:32.250
But Mariah was obsessed with it.

37:32.333 --> 37:33.877
<i>We need that gun.</i>

37:34.878 --> 37:38.548
Then get a warrant and go get it from her.

37:38.631 --> 37:41.050
Because I've given you everything.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.428
I'm done.

37:49.434 --> 37:50.435
Janis.

37:51.269 --> 37:52.437
Janis...

37:54.898 --> 37:55.899
I didn't...

37:55.982 --> 37:57.901
I didn't... I didn't know.

38:20.048 --> 38:21.758
Sit your ass down.

38:25.637 --> 38:27.555
I'm not done with you yet.

38:37.482 --> 38:39.234
We need that gun.

38:41.861 --> 38:46.241
Or else this whole deal goes away.

38:46.324 --> 38:47.742
So where is it?

40:02.150 --> 40:03.318
Thank you, brother.

40:08.281 --> 40:09.657
You can leave now.

40:09.741 --> 40:12.285
How you plan to get through
without backup?

40:13.703 --> 40:16.623
Mariah's operating with plenty of guards.

40:20.335 --> 40:21.920
If you're born to hang,

40:22.879 --> 40:25.256
- you can't drown.
- Mmm-mmm.

40:26.382 --> 40:28.259
Anansi, gone.

40:29.427 --> 40:32.055
My cousin, gone.

40:33.181 --> 40:35.600
You're the only family I have left.

40:37.268 --> 40:38.978
I can't lose you.

40:42.690 --> 40:44.233
All is well, brother.

40:45.443 --> 40:46.694
We can't lose.

40:49.656 --> 40:51.449
But my mother's calling to me.

40:52.408 --> 40:54.577
She wants justice. Hmm?

40:57.538 --> 40:58.790
Tonight...

41:02.794 --> 41:04.295
I'm gonna give it to her.

42:33.426 --> 42:35.219
<i>Take your glasses off.</i>

42:39.182 --> 42:40.892
You been crying?

42:40.975 --> 42:42.143
Allergies.

42:43.019 --> 42:44.437
I'm allergic to bullshit.

42:46.230 --> 42:47.940
No. Keep 'em off.

42:51.444 --> 42:53.488
I've always liked your eyes.

43:01.954 --> 43:03.247
What do you want?

43:04.499 --> 43:07.627
I want you. Simple as that.

43:08.211 --> 43:10.296
Nothing's ever simple with you.

43:17.720 --> 43:19.555
I wanted to say that I'm sorry.

43:22.183 --> 43:23.643
Let's go talk about it in the office.

43:23.726 --> 43:24.811
Hey...

43:26.562 --> 43:28.981
I paid a fortune for a legend tonight.

43:30.274 --> 43:32.527
Let's enjoy him first.

45:56.420 --> 45:57.630
We need to talk.

45:59.215 --> 46:01.050
So you can apologize properly

46:01.133 --> 46:04.136
for that Ike Turner shit
you pulled up in here?

46:05.054 --> 46:07.181
I'm not proud of how I handled that.

46:07.264 --> 46:08.808
You are who you are.

46:09.392 --> 46:10.851
And who are you supposed to be?

46:12.311 --> 46:13.229
Huh?

46:13.312 --> 46:14.981
You in bed with the Chinese?

46:16.148 --> 46:17.525
With drugs now?

46:17.608 --> 46:19.193
Slow your roll.

46:20.444 --> 46:23.280
I ain't decided how I feel about you yet.

46:37.169 --> 46:38.170
Hey.

46:38.921 --> 46:40.548
Where you been all day?

46:40.631 --> 46:41.966
With Shades.

46:42.675 --> 46:44.635
He gave up Mariah.

46:45.720 --> 46:46.804
Everything.

46:48.014 --> 46:50.808
So that's your play? A wire?

46:51.726 --> 46:53.227
She's too smart for that.

46:53.310 --> 46:56.814
I didn't send a pawn after the queen.
I sent a bishop.

46:57.606 --> 46:59.275
What, you got a better idea?

47:00.568 --> 47:01.902
Nope.

47:08.075 --> 47:09.452
But I'm working on one.

47:38.064 --> 47:39.523
Where the hell is he?

48:05.424 --> 48:06.675
It's down there.

48:09.345 --> 48:10.513
Hey.

48:11.931 --> 48:15.101
Remember, it's just Mariah.
No one else gets hurt.

48:18.854 --> 48:19.980
Wait for me.

48:49.426 --> 48:51.971
I need you alone.
Come to the lair.

48:52.638 --> 48:54.014
"The lair"?

48:54.098 --> 48:55.850
Where the hell is that?

48:55.933 --> 48:57.143
Hey, Bailey.

48:57.810 --> 48:59.019
Do you have blueprints?

49:01.772 --> 49:03.357
Oh, shit.

50:05.252 --> 50:08.631
Maybe we can get back
to the way things were.

50:15.596 --> 50:17.181
Mmm.

50:18.015 --> 50:20.226
No, baby.

50:21.101 --> 50:23.562
I don't think
we're gonna be able to do that.

51:15.823 --> 51:16.949
Sit down.

51:25.040 --> 51:27.251
A goddamn snitch.

51:29.295 --> 51:30.337
He's here.

53:00.636 --> 53:02.012
Give me the gun and get behind me.

53:07.518 --> 53:09.186
I need you to listen to me.

53:09.603 --> 53:11.480
We got one shot at this dude.

53:18.278 --> 53:19.446
Now!

53:20.197 --> 53:21.240
Shit.

53:23.700 --> 53:25.619
Where the hell is Luke Cage?

53:27.371 --> 53:28.747
Luke!

53:34.211 --> 53:35.295
Luke.

53:37.381 --> 53:38.382
Luke?

53:40.509 --> 53:43.178
Luke, are you okay?

53:44.888 --> 53:45.931
Yeah.

53:47.182 --> 53:48.267
Yeah.

53:50.185 --> 53:52.438
- Where is he?
- He went after Mariah.

53:53.689 --> 53:55.274
But look at you, man.

53:56.650 --> 53:58.527
I don't think you can stop him.

54:01.864 --> 54:02.948
Watch me.

55:01.256 --> 55:03.550
God!

55:21.610 --> 55:23.737
- Come.
- No! No!

55:23.820 --> 55:25.864
Get your goddamn hands off me! No!

55:25.948 --> 55:27.366
Watch my eyes

55:27.449 --> 55:30.077
as I squeeze that bloodclaat life
out of you.

56:12.160 --> 56:13.370
Do it!

56:13.954 --> 56:15.205
Kill him!

56:20.877 --> 56:23.422
Break his goddamn neck, Luke!

56:26.633 --> 56:29.011
Do it! Do it!

56:32.014 --> 56:33.098
Kill him!

56:34.433 --> 56:35.475
Luke.

56:36.518 --> 56:37.519
Luke!

57:17.142 --> 57:18.602
Did you get him?

57:18.685 --> 57:20.520
- Who?
- Bushmaster.

57:20.604 --> 57:22.940
No. He's gone.

57:32.616 --> 57:34.201
Shit.

57:52.052 --> 57:56.556
Mariah Stokes Dillard...

57:57.724 --> 58:01.603
you are under arrest
for the murder of Candace Miller,

58:01.687 --> 58:05.065
Cornell Stokes,
and the massacre at Gwen's.

58:05.148 --> 58:07.567
I didn't pull the trigger.

58:07.651 --> 58:11.071
You have the right to remain silent.

58:11.780 --> 58:15.117
- Anything you say...
- I know my goddamn rights.

58:16.201 --> 58:18.537
Do you really think this is gonna hold?

58:19.454 --> 58:22.040
It's his word against mine.

58:24.376 --> 58:29.297
And he is a goddamn gutter gangster.

58:32.634 --> 58:33.635
A lowlife.

58:35.721 --> 58:38.432
And I am Mariah Stokes.

58:39.349 --> 58:41.685
Forever councilwoman of Harlem.

58:42.602 --> 58:44.521
Millionaire philanthropist.

58:45.397 --> 58:48.066
Everybody will clock this
for just what it is.

58:48.150 --> 58:53.447
The pigs trying to drag
yet another successful sister down.

58:54.656 --> 58:59.745
You best believe the court
of public opinion will eat you alive.

58:59.828 --> 59:02.873
Well, a court of law will convict you.

59:05.417 --> 59:06.418
Let's go.

59:07.377 --> 59:08.587
Get her out of here.

59:12.340 --> 59:13.467
Let's go.

59:52.297 --> 59:53.340
Finally...

59:54.049 --> 59:55.217
a win.

59:56.134 --> 59:57.636
We ain't win shit.

01:00:01.890 --> 01:00:03.141
This ain't over yet.
