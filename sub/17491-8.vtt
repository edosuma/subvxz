09:53.926 --> 09:58.306
I run so fast that slowpokes
like her can't even see me.

09:59.598 --> 10:01.434
{\an3}Sweet.
Snagged an earring.

10:01.517 --> 10:03.060
{\an3}[laughs]

10:04.312 --> 10:05.855
Now I stole a belt!

10:05.938 --> 10:08.482
Look, his pants
are coming down.

10:08.566 --> 10:09.525
{\an3}[laughing]

10:09.608 --> 10:12.194
{\an1}You're the one
stealing everything!

10:12.278 --> 10:13.988
I take things.

10:14.071 --> 10:15.656
{\an3}Like this!

10:15.740 --> 10:18.200
{\an1}[gasps] That's my
eighth favorite button!

10:18.284 --> 10:20.703
{\an1}Give me my button back,
you dirty donut!

10:20.786 --> 10:23.581
{\an3}Go ahead and try,
but you'll never get it back.

10:23.664 --> 10:24.999

Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, watch it!

10:36.093 --> 10:39.221
{\an1}Wow, you smell just as delicious
as regular donuts.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.182
I'm even more delicious.

10:41.265 --> 10:43.225
Extra delicious donuts?

10:43.309 --> 10:44.852
That's my favorite!

10:44.935 --> 10:48.147
Now give me back my button
or it's donuts for lunch.

10:48.230 --> 10:49.523
{\an3}Ow!
What the--

10:49.607 --> 10:53.235
{\an3}You found my weakness:
being eaten!

10:53.319 --> 10:54.695
{\an3}Aah!

10:54.779 --> 10:56.030
{\an3}No!
Aah!

10:56.113 --> 10:58.532

11:03.329 --> 11:04.455
My button!

11:04.538 --> 11:07.041
Oh, I've missed you.
Mwah, mwah.

11:07.124 --> 11:09.752
Don't you ever leave
my pants again.

11:09.835 --> 11:11.212
Yum, yum, yum.

11:13.547 --> 11:15.257
One of these comics
should tell me

11:15.341 --> 11:18.052
how I can get
my own superpowers.

11:18.135 --> 11:20.262
"Destroyer Walrus

11:20.346 --> 11:22.056
This looks interesting.

11:22.139 --> 11:24.225
- Ah.
- Let me see that!

11:24.308 --> 11:26.977
Wow, this is so lame.

11:27.061 --> 11:28.729
How can you read this stuff?

11:28.813 --> 11:29.814
Give me that!

11:29.897 --> 11:31.732
Walrus Woman, that's it!

11:31.816 --> 11:34.652
I'll get my superpowers
the same way she did,

11:34.735 --> 11:37.154
{\an1}through a radioactive
walrus bite.

11:37.238 --> 11:39.782
{\an1}I'll see you guys later.
I've got work to do.

Yeah, exactly.

12:04.932 --> 12:07.059
Hello?
Hello?

12:07.143 --> 12:10.479
There's gotta be a walrus

{\an1}Come on!

12:35.796 --> 12:37.089
Please, just bite me!

13:13.292 --> 13:15.878
{\an3}Hmm.
It's infected.

13:15.961 --> 13:17.171
I can see that.

13:17.254 --> 13:19.048
{\an1}But it's the good kind
of infection, right?

13:19.131 --> 13:22.384
{\an1}The kind that'll give me super
walrus powers, right, right?

13:22.468 --> 13:23.761
{\an1}[coughs]
Right?

13:23.844 --> 13:26.472
{\an3}No, it's the kind
that'll make you sick.

Why didn't you say so?

13:42.905 --> 13:45.282
Superpower surgery!

13:45.366 --> 13:47.785
{\an1}You can give me
any superpower I want?

13:47.868 --> 13:49.286
{\an1}I'm in!
How much is it?

13:49.370 --> 13:52.581
It's only
50 bazillion dollars.

13:52.665 --> 13:53.958
Can I have a discount?

13:54.041 --> 13:55.876
That is the discount,
