01:01.929 --> 01:03.796
Lord, please!

01:06.167 --> 01:07.900
Where's the sheriff?

01:08.903 --> 01:10.069
Get inside.

01:11.472 --> 01:12.905
Keep goin'.

01:38.199 --> 01:40.499
Damn it!

01:45.739 --> 01:48.006
Please, please let me in.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.850
Morning, Ms. Patty.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.652
Good day, Mr. Swearengen.

07:00.654 --> 07:02.854
I look forward to
seein' you at services.

07:17.838 --> 07:19.471
Let go of me.

07:22.576 --> 07:25.010
What the hell is wrong with you?

07:25.012 --> 07:26.978
This girl's far too young.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.513
She was with this
when we took her.

07:28.515 --> 07:31.650
I figured maybe she could
do some cleaning and such.

07:31.652 --> 07:34.453
No, she's too cute to
be cleanin' and scrubbin'.

07:37.658 --> 07:38.658
Daisy.

07:42.262 --> 07:44.496
Yes, I speak both.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.936
For you, my dear,

07:50.938 --> 07:53.972
you are going to make
a top-notch hostess.

07:55.609 --> 07:59.811
I am not a whore and you
have no right to bring us here!

07:59.813 --> 08:02.981
Watch your mouth in
front of the child.

08:02.983 --> 08:06.284
I didn't say whore,
I said hostess.

08:06.286 --> 08:08.053
Yeah, what's the difference?

08:08.055 --> 08:10.722
Well, hostess is what
we say in polite company.

08:10.724 --> 08:13.258
But you're right, it's
all the same work.

08:13.260 --> 08:15.427
Get her cleaned up,
make yourself at home.

08:16.196 --> 08:17.696
I'll have you know,

08:17.698 --> 08:19.731
we come from one of the
finest families in Dakota.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.566
That's not true, sir.

08:21.568 --> 08:24.336
This abduction will
not go unchallenged.

08:24.338 --> 08:25.770
Someone will come for us!

13:45.759 --> 13:46.891
Colonel?

13:46.893 --> 13:47.959
Is that you?

14:01.541 --> 14:03.741
I've been looking
all over for you.

14:09.082 --> 14:12.083
The people in town say you
might be here, down by the lake.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.427
My name is Ursula.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.929
I have been reading about
you in the periodicals.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.533
It's a pleasure to meet you.

14:29.636 --> 14:32.003
The famed war-hero
turned gun-for-hire.

14:33.673 --> 14:35.139
I'm not for hire today.

14:37.010 --> 14:39.177
Oh, where are my manners?

14:39.179 --> 14:40.179
Forgive me.

14:42.249 --> 14:44.315
A peace offering, Colonel.

14:44.317 --> 14:46.317
So you can consider my request.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.529
It's quite good.

14:58.531 --> 14:59.564
I assure you.

15:05.105 --> 15:07.772
I'll do the talking,
you'll do the eating.

15:10.977 --> 15:11.977
Please.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.089
Who?

15:26.960 --> 15:27.960
Who what?

15:30.196 --> 15:32.697
Who do you want me to kill?

15:39.839 --> 15:44.342
I'll be blunt, I'm in need
of a military-trained killer.

15:46.346 --> 15:49.047
I require you to
use your talents

15:49.049 --> 15:53.618
to terminate the men who
abducted my beloved sister.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.753
They also took one
of my servant girls.

15:56.656 --> 15:59.023
I need those two girls alive.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.527
And the men who took them?

16:03.330 --> 16:04.330
Dead.

16:05.665 --> 16:06.665
Sorry, but no.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.603
I'm told this is what you do.

16:15.175 --> 16:18.343
I have other
business to attend to.

16:18.345 --> 16:20.511
Can't that business wait?

16:27.053 --> 16:29.554
No, finish the food.

16:30.690 --> 16:31.723
I insist.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.900
I can pay you for your
services, Colonel.

16:42.902 --> 16:45.136
Whatever price you say.

16:45.138 --> 16:49.007
What I cannot do is accept the
word no for an answer to this

16:49.009 --> 16:50.908
ever-so-urgent request.

16:54.481 --> 16:59.517
I only have a no for you.

17:03.023 --> 17:05.022
I'm pleading with you, Colonel.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.295
Thank you, the
food was very good.

17:15.300 --> 17:16.300
Was it?

17:28.581 --> 17:29.614
Interesting.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.786
Listen carefully, Colonel.

17:36.189 --> 17:39.624
This food was poisoned.

17:45.331 --> 17:46.397
Purposefully.

17:47.600 --> 17:50.034
My captured sister
has the antidote.

17:51.304 --> 17:54.372
Save her and save yourself.

17:55.708 --> 17:58.109
What kind of game
are you playing?

17:58.111 --> 18:02.680
This is no game, no
boast and no exaggeration.

18:03.650 --> 18:04.916
You've been poisoned.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.688
The poison you
ingested will kill you

18:10.690 --> 18:11.956
in the three days' time.

18:13.693 --> 18:16.194
My sister is only one
day's ride from here.

18:17.330 --> 18:20.364
We have plenty of
time to save her,

18:20.366 --> 18:22.667
and give you the antidote.

18:24.971 --> 18:27.338
And if you don't believe
me about the poison,

18:29.409 --> 18:32.777
you should be feeling a
little bit of a tummy ache,

18:32.779 --> 18:33.779
right about now.

18:57.403 --> 18:59.670
I know you can kill
me, but if you do,

18:59.672 --> 19:03.107
you will never find my
sister, or her antidote.

19:09.716 --> 19:12.984
If you shoot me, you'll be
signing your own death warrant.

19:18.658 --> 19:21.726
Your convulsions will
end soon, don't fret.

19:47.320 --> 19:50.454
You bore than well, Colonel.

19:56.162 --> 20:00.064
You give into your anger now,
you'll be dead in three days.

20:01.134 --> 20:03.367
Give me the antidote, now.

20:03.369 --> 20:05.169
I don't have it.

20:05.171 --> 20:07.872
And even if I did, I
wouldn't give it to you.

20:07.874 --> 20:11.943
I'll die for my sister, Colonel.

20:11.945 --> 20:13.177
Believe me.

20:13.179 --> 20:14.512
And if I kill you now?

20:15.848 --> 20:18.616
I'm ready, but then you
need to be ready to die, too.

20:18.618 --> 20:20.952
Are you?

20:51.384 --> 20:56.320
If I'm not given the antidote
in time for whatever reason,

20:56.656 --> 20:57.656
you die.

22:35.154 --> 22:36.554
Howdy, howdy.

22:36.556 --> 22:39.123
Ya'll got anything
to trade or sell?

22:39.125 --> 22:41.559
No, I'm afraid we need
all of our provisions.

22:42.628 --> 22:46.130
My name's Morton
and we pay fair money.

22:46.132 --> 22:49.300
I see you got lots of
goods and supplies there.

22:49.302 --> 22:50.401
Are you goin' far?

22:52.004 --> 22:53.004
Far enough.

23:14.093 --> 23:15.393
I understand and accept

23:15.395 --> 23:17.728
that you ain't got
nothin' to sell,

23:17.730 --> 23:20.598
but I do have one
more question for you.

23:20.600 --> 23:21.932
We are in a hurry.

23:23.703 --> 23:27.071
All due respect to you
and your bodyguard there,

23:27.073 --> 23:29.707
I was hopin' I could buy just
a few minutes of your time

23:29.709 --> 23:31.308
behind them trees over there.

23:32.412 --> 23:34.445
I'm in desperate need
of a woman's touch.

23:35.681 --> 23:36.947
Excuse me?

23:36.949 --> 23:38.149
How dare you.

23:38.151 --> 23:39.517
I am not for sale.

23:40.319 --> 23:41.819
Well, I don't wanna buy ya.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.455
I just wanna rent
ya for a spell.

23:45.625 --> 23:46.891
And I pay top dollar.

23:59.772 --> 24:01.338
Oh, my goodness.

24:06.412 --> 24:07.845
Why'd you kill him?

24:07.847 --> 24:08.847
His vest.

24:09.682 --> 24:11.348
It had bullet holes.

24:11.350 --> 24:12.883
You can't just murder
people on the possibility

24:12.885 --> 24:15.119
of what they might be.

24:15.121 --> 24:17.488
They were scavenger, or worse.

24:39.812 --> 24:41.445
Did they come from the north?

24:46.352 --> 24:49.987
Well, I'm glad you got 'em
out of our way here because,

24:50.923 --> 24:52.256
we need to go north.

24:54.227 --> 24:55.659
They might have friends.

24:58.097 --> 24:59.530
And I have you.

26:01.861 --> 26:06.931
Darlin', when I got to
this town, it was nothin'.

26:08.034 --> 26:10.801
And I was nothin' for a
long time, growin' up.

26:10.803 --> 26:13.237
I ate the scraps that
were meant for dogs.

26:14.173 --> 26:16.006
I robbed people when I had to.

26:17.143 --> 26:19.310
I did what needed to
be done to survive.

26:20.713 --> 26:22.446
And I made somethin' of myself.

26:24.884 --> 26:26.584
I built this town
into somethin'.

26:32.158 --> 26:34.692
My men told me that
you're refusin' to service

26:34.694 --> 26:36.527
the cowboys who came in today.

26:37.496 --> 26:39.163
They paid good money for you,

26:40.232 --> 26:41.599
and I had to refund them.

26:41.601 --> 26:43.801
I told you I wasn't a whore.

26:43.803 --> 26:47.171
Yeah, you told me you
weren't, but you are now.

26:48.274 --> 26:51.408
You're a hostess,
it's your new life.

26:51.410 --> 26:54.912
You can be comfortable,
ask any of the other girls.

26:56.349 --> 26:59.850
I'm not looking for comfort,
I'm looking to go home.

26:59.852 --> 27:02.419
But a home is no
longer an option for you.

27:03.723 --> 27:06.190
Now listen, I know a Chinaman
that will pay good money

27:06.192 --> 27:08.359
for a spunky little
white girl like you.

27:08.361 --> 27:10.961
He'll put you on a boat
and ship you to the orient.

27:10.963 --> 27:12.262
So, you'll get to travel.

27:13.666 --> 27:15.566
Or we could settle
this another way.

27:16.802 --> 27:19.236
That little girl who was
brought here with you?

27:20.573 --> 27:21.639
Are you fond of her?

27:22.575 --> 27:24.041
Do not touch her.

27:25.144 --> 27:28.612
Well, I got my answer,
but just so you know,

27:28.614 --> 27:31.148
I would never harm a cute
little girl like that.

27:32.518 --> 27:34.818
What kind of
monster do you think I am?

27:36.656 --> 27:38.255
That remains to be seen.

27:40.559 --> 27:42.660
Daisy, come on in here, darlin'.

27:49.735 --> 27:51.735
I'm gonna keep
your little friend.

27:51.737 --> 27:55.873
You see, my wife is barren
and she can't give me a child.

27:57.243 --> 27:59.843
So, I'm gonna take great
care of Daisy.

28:02.081 --> 28:03.081
No.

28:06.485 --> 28:09.319
Then do what you were
brought here to do, darlin'.

28:11.357 --> 28:13.457
I got a group of prospectors
comin' through here

28:13.459 --> 28:14.725
in two or three days.

28:16.996 --> 28:20.898
And I want as much of their
money as is humanly possible.

28:22.201 --> 28:24.134
Are you gonna help
me get that money?

28:25.237 --> 28:27.037
Please don't make me do this.

28:28.507 --> 28:30.841
Look, I'm giving you a choice.

28:30.843 --> 28:33.744
You can either ship
off to China-land,

28:33.746 --> 28:35.779
and learn to serve
their carnal desires,

28:35.781 --> 28:37.948
tied to a bed with an
opium pipe in your mouth,

28:37.950 --> 28:41.452
and a line of Chinamen
poundin' away at your,

28:41.454 --> 28:42.920
at your private parts.

28:44.457 --> 28:46.824
Or you can stay
here and work for me

28:46.826 --> 28:49.026
in the pleasant
town of Deadwood.

28:49.028 --> 28:51.261
Be close to your little friend.

28:51.263 --> 28:54.231
You have a private room,
there's a bathtub, a kitchen.

28:57.002 --> 28:59.069
It's your choice,
but either way,

28:59.071 --> 29:01.004
I'm gonna get my
money's worth of you.

29:06.345 --> 29:09.079
I'm sorry, Colonel,
but I need a rest.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.614
Even the horses need it.

29:11.717 --> 29:14.284
You might be able
to march endlessly,

29:14.286 --> 29:17.087
or whatever else they
taught you in the military,

29:17.089 --> 29:19.289
but I'm not a soldier.

29:21.727 --> 29:23.644
Time for respite.

29:23.645 --> 29:25.562
Besides, when we arrive,
we'll need you to be strong,

29:25.564 --> 29:29.233
rested, and with your
sagacity about you.

29:29.235 --> 29:31.201
Not tired or emaciated.

29:33.773 --> 29:37.107
Let's eat, let's rest,
so that we can be strong

29:37.109 --> 29:40.177
for the remainder of our trek
and the fight that awaits us.

29:51.757 --> 29:53.557
I have been followed
your exploits

29:53.559 --> 29:55.159
in the periodicals, Colonel.

29:56.395 --> 29:58.295
You've had a colorful
change of career

29:58.297 --> 29:59.663
since you left the army.

30:00.766 --> 30:04.268
From high-ranking
officer, to gunman.

30:07.406 --> 30:11.308
Are all the things I've
heard about you true?

30:13.946 --> 30:15.512
What have you heard?

30:17.416 --> 30:20.083
That when you returned
home from the war,

30:21.120 --> 30:22.820
your house was
burnt to the ground.

30:24.456 --> 30:28.025
They say you went mad and
became an Indian fighter.

31:09.535 --> 31:14.605
I also read that you took on
a gang of bandits in Mexico,

31:15.407 --> 31:16.573
with just your six-shooter?

31:31.223 --> 31:32.223
Well?

31:33.292 --> 31:35.292
Any truth to those stories?

31:37.730 --> 31:39.129
Or are they lies?

31:40.266 --> 31:41.266
It's all true.

31:45.804 --> 31:46.837
Especially the lies.

31:48.607 --> 31:50.140
Oh, please, go on.

32:04.256 --> 32:05.956
Oh, no, no.

32:05.958 --> 32:07.791
It's not poisoned.

32:07.793 --> 32:09.593
Not this time, I can assure you.

32:13.532 --> 32:14.532
You see?

32:23.475 --> 32:24.574
Oh, dear.

32:28.247 --> 32:30.380
That is from that initial dose.

32:30.382 --> 32:31.615
My apologies.

32:35.087 --> 32:37.554
It's a most unfortunate
side-effect.

32:37.556 --> 32:39.156
What's even worse is that,

32:40.526 --> 32:41.925
it might happen again.

33:35.314 --> 33:36.713
We need to go.

33:43.455 --> 33:45.022
Sun's up.

33:45.024 --> 33:46.556
And die of pneumonia?

33:49.094 --> 33:50.594
It's so cold.

33:53.832 --> 33:54.965
It snowed?

33:59.004 --> 34:00.437
Tell me about this poison.

34:06.178 --> 34:08.311
There isn't much to tell.

34:08.313 --> 34:09.579
Tell me anyways.

34:10.649 --> 34:12.983
Well, it was more like a recipe

34:12.985 --> 34:14.484
I was shown when I was young.

34:15.554 --> 34:17.120
Where did you get it?

34:17.121 --> 34:18.688
Our housemaid.

34:18.690 --> 34:20.190
A lady named Maria.

34:20.192 --> 34:22.626
Was a medicine woman
before she worked for us.

34:23.962 --> 34:25.862
She said that all of the
married women in the village

34:25.864 --> 34:27.864
would ask her for it.

34:27.866 --> 34:29.533
For the poison?

34:29.534 --> 34:32.702
They'd poison their
husbands before they went out,

34:32.704 --> 34:34.838
and if their husband
found another woman,

34:36.141 --> 34:39.409
or they didn't come home
for whatever reason,

34:40.579 --> 34:42.344
the poison would take hold,

34:44.483 --> 34:45.483
and they'd die.

34:46.752 --> 34:47.752
Deservedly.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.487
But, if they were good men,

34:52.824 --> 34:55.025
they would come home and
their wives would give them

34:55.027 --> 34:56.760
the antidote with their dinner.

34:59.832 --> 35:03.333
Their husbands never knew
what almost befell them.

35:06.972 --> 35:09.639
It's really rather ingenious.

35:12.611 --> 35:13.710
It's time to go.

35:32.998 --> 35:34.464
Guard the horses.

35:36.401 --> 35:37.634
And what are you going to do?

35:37.636 --> 35:39.469
I thought you were
in a hurry to leave?

36:53.278 --> 36:54.578
It's me.

36:55.814 --> 36:57.180
The horses?

36:57.182 --> 36:59.749
They're tied, now
what's our situation?

37:00.986 --> 37:02.118
We're being hunted.

37:03.455 --> 37:04.854
By who?

37:04.856 --> 37:06.256
Highwaymen?

37:06.258 --> 37:07.258
Horse thieves?

37:09.127 --> 37:11.728
Cohorts of that Morton
character, no doubt.

37:13.065 --> 37:14.564
Doesn't matter.

37:14.566 --> 37:16.566
Well, what does matter?

37:19.438 --> 37:21.238
They have more guns.

37:21.240 --> 37:22.572
What do we do?

37:23.442 --> 37:24.274
That depends.

37:24.276 --> 37:25.475
On, on what?

37:28.080 --> 37:28.912
You.

37:28.914 --> 37:29.879
Me?

37:29.881 --> 37:31.648
Well, I'm ready for anything.

37:31.650 --> 37:33.950
We have a life-and-death
mission to complete.

37:36.188 --> 37:39.022
You're the military man, do
you have a plan of attack?

37:42.160 --> 37:43.160
Yeah.

37:44.496 --> 37:47.297
By all means, Colonel,
tell me what to do.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.600
You won't like it.

37:50.602 --> 37:53.670
I like the idea of being
robbed or killed even less.

37:53.672 --> 37:56.206
And now, you might think
me weak or fearful,

37:56.208 --> 37:59.276
but I assure you,
I am ready for war.

38:01.046 --> 38:02.412
Leave the war to me.

38:12.891 --> 38:15.625
- What'd you see?
- A lady.

38:15.627 --> 38:18.161
She's ripe and ready
for some lovin'.

38:18.163 --> 38:19.863
- And how many horses?
- Two.

38:20.966 --> 38:23.099
Safe to assume
she's got company.

39:17.089 --> 39:18.822
Come on, let's go.

40:39.037 --> 40:40.670
I think they know it's a trap.

40:42.274 --> 40:43.973
It isn't gonna work.

40:45.043 --> 40:46.409
It is working.

40:47.345 --> 40:48.345
Believe me.

41:11.903 --> 41:12.903
Just do it.

41:25.684 --> 41:26.684
Hot damn.

42:31.449 --> 42:34.284
We'll be takin' your horses.

42:34.286 --> 42:35.351
Belongings.

42:41.026 --> 42:42.692
And we're each gonna be needin'

42:42.694 --> 42:44.661
a little bit of lovin' from you.

42:44.663 --> 42:46.296
Except, we're gentlemen.

42:47.799 --> 42:49.632
So, we'll go one at a time.

42:53.238 --> 42:54.270
You play nice...

42:56.174 --> 42:57.607
You might live through this.

43:00.145 --> 43:05.148
Actually, you will do as
I say and leave us alone.

43:06.284 --> 43:09.352
Or you die the same way
your friend Morton died.

43:13.091 --> 43:14.223
You killed Morton?

43:16.595 --> 43:18.962
He left us no choice.

43:18.964 --> 43:21.397
You still have a choice.

43:21.399 --> 43:25.168
I lured you in and you're
standing directly in our trap.

43:34.446 --> 43:38.247
Leave now, or we
will gun you down,

43:38.249 --> 43:40.483
right here, where you stand.

43:46.157 --> 43:47.157
We?

43:48.460 --> 43:49.460
We who?

43:50.562 --> 43:53.196
I was trying to
give you a chance.

43:55.100 --> 43:56.332
Very well, then.

43:57.335 --> 43:58.335
Colonel?

44:03.475 --> 44:04.475
Now.

44:13.952 --> 44:16.552
Well, you talk a
good game, woman.

44:16.554 --> 44:18.988
Let's see what else you
can do with that mouth.

45:16.081 --> 45:21.150
Gotcha.

46:58.016 --> 47:00.416
Grab that gun and
go watch the horses.

48:15.760 --> 48:17.093
And the horses?

48:18.897 --> 48:21.230
You killed all of
the villains, darling.

48:21.232 --> 48:22.832
I'm sure the horses are fine.

48:25.169 --> 48:29.472
I, on the other hand, am
probably permanently scarred

48:29.474 --> 48:31.274
from the anguish I suffered,

48:31.276 --> 48:34.043
nearly being ravaged by
those filthy animals.

48:38.816 --> 48:41.217
Come on, hee-yah!

49:11.783 --> 49:13.449
I guess there was another man.

49:18.022 --> 49:21.724
I realize the rest of the
journey will take longer now but,

49:21.726 --> 49:23.392
we still need to go forward.

49:24.495 --> 49:25.561
How much further?

49:26.431 --> 49:27.431
By foot?

49:30.568 --> 49:33.202
I'd estimate another
two or three days.

49:34.572 --> 49:37.606
Surely a strong man like you
can make that simple journey.

49:37.608 --> 49:40.343
But not with your poison
coursing through my blood.

49:46.651 --> 49:47.917
About the poison.

49:47.919 --> 49:48.919
What?

49:51.089 --> 49:52.089
Talk!

49:53.791 --> 49:56.092
I didn't really poison you.

49:56.094 --> 49:58.894
All I did was give you something
to give you stomach cramps

49:58.896 --> 50:00.696
so that you would
believe my story.

50:08.539 --> 50:10.339
As far as I know,
there's no poison

50:10.341 --> 50:11.907
that works the way I told you.

50:13.111 --> 50:16.112
I apologize for the
trickery, Colonel.

50:16.114 --> 50:17.847
There's no poison in your body.

50:42.273 --> 50:44.173
Please don't leave me!

50:44.175 --> 50:48.310
I shouldn't have lied to
you, but I'm desperate!

50:49.414 --> 50:52.515
Colonel, you can't just
walk away like this!

50:52.517 --> 50:54.350
You can't let the bad guys win!

50:55.753 --> 50:57.053
I beg of you.

50:58.089 --> 51:00.322
I'll give you anything you want.

51:08.266 --> 51:09.665
Anything?

51:12.236 --> 51:13.236
Yes.

51:19.610 --> 51:20.876
Whatever you want.

51:53.744 --> 51:54.744
My love.

51:55.580 --> 51:56.879
You are a liar.

52:00.084 --> 52:04.186
And the only thing I want
from you, is your absence.

52:20.705 --> 52:23.672
I've seen you in
action, Colonel.

52:28.646 --> 52:30.412
I've seen your heart.

52:30.414 --> 52:32.481
You won't leave those
girls to suffer.

52:39.023 --> 52:41.690
Nor would you leave me to
face the abductors alone.

52:46.731 --> 52:48.430
Turn around!

52:48.432 --> 52:51.167
I demand you turn
around this instant!

53:37.582 --> 53:39.148
No time for tears.

53:44.055 --> 53:45.788
There is work to do.

55:12.076 --> 55:15.077
Why're you lookin'
so sad, little darlin'?

55:15.079 --> 55:17.446
Them prospectors are gonna
be here in a few hours.

55:17.448 --> 55:20.215
You want your bath
now, or after?

55:22.253 --> 55:23.253
Go to hell.

55:24.255 --> 55:26.121
Someone's gonna
come for me soon.

55:27.758 --> 55:29.058
Suit yourself.

55:29.060 --> 55:31.260
I hear these ones have
a tendency to be rough.

55:31.262 --> 55:33.162
Oh, I think she
likes it rough, Lemmy.

55:33.164 --> 55:34.830
After's probably better.

55:34.832 --> 55:37.933
Right, princess?

57:48.432 --> 57:50.833
Hold this for me, darlin'.

57:57.541 --> 58:00.943
Nephew, you look like you
could use some relaxin' with

58:00.945 --> 58:04.346
one of the beautiful women of
the Gem Theater and Saloon.

58:04.348 --> 58:05.814
Go ahead, first one's on me.

58:09.286 --> 58:10.786
You gonna tell me
what's on your mind,

58:10.788 --> 58:12.421
or are you gonna make me guess?

58:14.725 --> 58:16.758
Just worried about
the new girl is all.

58:16.760 --> 58:18.827
She says someone will
be comin' for her.

58:20.130 --> 58:22.397
Well, if someone's comin'
for her, they're gonna

58:22.399 --> 58:25.601
have to go through you
and your men, aren't they?

58:25.603 --> 58:28.437
Now I know you're nervous,
but I tell ya somethin'.

58:28.439 --> 58:33.308
When I was your age, I had
to do what needed to be done

58:33.310 --> 58:36.645
to get what we got,
and now it's your turn,

58:36.647 --> 58:39.248
to do what you got to
do to keep what we got.

58:41.952 --> 58:42.952
Have a drink, son.

58:44.088 --> 58:45.721
Sierra.

58:45.723 --> 58:47.256
Get my hat, darlin'.

01:01:20.811 --> 01:01:22.811
I was told you keep
a lookout for ladies

01:01:22.813 --> 01:01:24.179
tryin' to escape the town.

01:01:25.783 --> 01:01:28.083
I never thought I'd find
one tryin' to sneak in.

01:01:30.854 --> 01:01:32.320
This isn't what you think.

01:01:33.991 --> 01:01:35.223
You lookin' for work?

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.960
'Cause we've got plenty
for a pretty lady like you.

01:01:38.962 --> 01:01:42.431
No, I'm here to find my sister.

01:01:42.433 --> 01:01:44.299
Well, I don't know
anything about that.

01:01:45.436 --> 01:01:47.502
But I know the boss will
pay me plenty for you.

01:02:55.672 --> 01:02:57.439
Now, I want those
miners to leave

01:02:57.441 --> 01:03:00.275
every gram of gold they've
got, here in Deadwood.

01:03:00.277 --> 01:03:04.079
So what we're gonna is build
ourselves a banker's booth

01:03:04.081 --> 01:03:06.815
at the end of the bar
in the Gem Theater.

01:03:06.817 --> 01:03:10.418
Past the lovely ladies, past
the whisky, you understand?

01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:28.837
Get inside, darlin'.

01:03:28.839 --> 01:03:29.839
Nephew?

01:03:30.707 --> 01:03:32.207
This woman could be trouble.

01:03:35.846 --> 01:03:38.880
So, I want you all to flank
her, and I'll flatter her

01:03:38.882 --> 01:03:41.750
until we know exactly what
she's gonna do with that gun.

01:03:59.436 --> 01:04:02.137
You are not gonna believe this,

01:04:02.139 --> 01:04:04.639
but you are just the girl
I've always dreamed of.

01:04:12.749 --> 01:04:16.952
It's amazing, you know how
time seems to stand still

01:04:16.954 --> 01:04:20.755
gazing upon such a visage
of beauty as you are.

01:04:26.396 --> 01:04:29.264
You abducted my sister
and one of my house girls.

01:04:33.237 --> 01:04:35.437
Bring them to me now
and I'll let you live.

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:39.841
Bring them to me not and you
die, right here, right now.

01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:44.813
Oh, my.

01:04:44.815 --> 01:04:45.815
I surrender.

01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:48.450
I accept your surrender.

01:04:49.853 --> 01:04:51.987
You might wanna
put that gun down,

01:04:51.989 --> 01:04:53.321
before someone gets hurt.

01:04:54.391 --> 01:04:56.858
Especially since
you are surrounded.

01:05:00.998 --> 01:05:02.697
Go ahead, take a
look behind you.

01:05:15.913 --> 01:05:18.179
I'm willing to
die for my sister.

01:05:23.186 --> 01:05:24.186
That's too bad.

01:06:41.031 --> 01:06:42.564
Who's shooting out there?

01:06:42.566 --> 01:06:44.799
I don't know, it's
down the street.

01:06:47.738 --> 01:06:49.337
Did anyone see you take those?

01:06:49.339 --> 01:06:50.339
No.

01:06:51.608 --> 01:06:52.774
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

01:06:53.677 --> 01:06:54.677
Let me see.

01:06:57.481 --> 01:06:58.713
It's this one.

01:07:00.217 --> 01:07:01.182
Got it!

01:07:01.184 --> 01:07:02.184
Let's go.

01:07:03.153 --> 01:07:04.153
Let's go.

01:07:26.643 --> 01:07:27.876
That's them!

01:07:29.613 --> 01:07:31.279
They went that way!

01:07:32.182 --> 01:07:33.182
Colonel!

01:08:46.356 --> 01:08:47.356
Hide!

01:10:08.305 --> 01:10:09.305
Hee-yah.

01:10:59.456 --> 01:11:00.456
Hee-yah.

01:11:36.693 --> 01:11:41.362
I'm tellin' ya, I heard
gunshots up here somewheres.

01:13:41.084 --> 01:13:42.417
Get up there.

01:15:01.197 --> 01:15:02.197
Colonel?

01:15:16.179 --> 01:15:17.179
Colonel!

01:15:18.014 --> 01:15:19.014
Colonel!

01:15:32.862 --> 01:15:34.262
What news, Colonel?

01:15:41.204 --> 01:15:42.770
Sorry to report.

01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:45.673
Your sister was killed.

01:16:02.325 --> 01:16:05.059
I was able to save
your servant girl.

01:16:53.343 --> 01:16:54.809
Are you hurt?

01:16:54.811 --> 01:16:56.611
No, I'm fine.

01:16:56.613 --> 01:16:57.878
I was so scared.

01:16:59.182 --> 01:17:00.514
They killed Abigale.

01:17:02.552 --> 01:17:05.386
I know, but you still have me,

01:17:05.388 --> 01:17:08.222
and your big sister won't
let any harm come to you.

01:17:08.224 --> 01:17:09.523
She's your sister?

01:17:11.761 --> 01:17:13.027
My father's daughter.

01:17:14.664 --> 01:17:18.265
When my mother passed away,
my father started to take

01:17:18.267 --> 01:17:20.434
a liking to one of
my servant girls...

01:17:22.171 --> 01:17:24.972
Maria, the one I told you about?

01:17:30.813 --> 01:17:32.279
My father married Maria.

01:17:35.652 --> 01:17:38.919
And nine months later,
I had a little sister.

01:18:38.948 --> 01:18:40.915
You're a good man, Colonel.

01:18:42.018 --> 01:18:44.085
I knew you wouldn't
let the bad guys win.

01:18:48.091 --> 01:18:50.191
I'm going to bury Abigale.

01:18:52.695 --> 01:18:54.695
And take my little sister home.

01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:06.707
We have a big house.

01:19:10.213 --> 01:19:11.812
And it's going to be empty now.

01:19:12.615 --> 01:19:15.116
We have lots of space and rooms.

01:19:17.053 --> 01:19:18.319
I was thinking...

01:19:24.994 --> 01:19:26.193
Maybe one day.

01:19:39.275 --> 01:19:40.674
Maybe one day.

01:22:25.074 --> 01:22:27.541
I don't let the bad guys win.

01:22:34.617 --> 01:22:35.617
Or leave.

01:22:48.050 --> 01:22:56.050
