WEBVTT

00:20.266 --> 00:22.533
I'll be back.
I'm free.

00:57.233 --> 00:58.633
Marriage..

00:58.700 --> 01:01.000
Holy padlock.

01:01.066 --> 01:04.300
Every man's worst nightmare.

01:04.366 --> 01:07.800
Is this the end of freedom
as I know it?

01:07.866 --> 01:10.733
Ladies and gentlemen, you judge.

01:14.566 --> 01:16.700
Can we live happily ever after?

01:17.866 --> 01:19.933
Or am I dicing with doom?

01:26.000 --> 01:28.300
Talk about
a major league mistake.

01:28.366 --> 01:29.433
'You can't call it off.'

01:29.500 --> 01:31.433
I still owe ten payments
on the engagement ring.

01:33.466 --> 01:35.766
I'm talking about the videotape.

01:35.833 --> 01:37.066
And your so called narration.

01:37.133 --> 01:38.500
Now, you are the one
who wanted to preview

01:38.566 --> 01:40.100
the look of tomorrow.

01:40.166 --> 01:42.500
You better not act weird
at the church.

01:42.566 --> 01:45.200
I thought you loved me
for my sick mind.

01:45.266 --> 01:47.500
It's important to me, please.

01:48.800 --> 01:51.866
Look, I'll be good tomorrow.
I promise.

01:51.933 --> 01:54.000
Gavin, this is important.

01:55.300 --> 01:57.433
If you're having doubts,
real doubts..

01:58.633 --> 02:00.766
...let's not go through with it.

02:00.833 --> 02:03.700
Come on, Jess, I love you.

02:03.766 --> 02:05.933
I know you do, but I want
this marriage to work.

02:07.533 --> 02:10.100
If you don't wanna run the whole
race, I wanna know now, Gavin.

02:10.166 --> 02:12.966
'Not in six months.
Not when it's too late.'

02:23.166 --> 02:26.300
Hey, the best men
are ready to roll.

02:26.366 --> 02:29.300
Wow! Very nice dress, Jessica.

02:29.366 --> 02:31.266
I thought it was bad luck.

02:31.333 --> 02:33.333
You know, to see the bride
in her virgin costume.

02:36.466 --> 02:38.100
Enjoy your
bachelor party, Gavin.

02:38.166 --> 02:40.866
Oh, don't worry, we will
have him back in one piece.

02:40.933 --> 02:42.900
At least, we'll try.

02:59.866 --> 03:01.566
This is your last night, Gavin.

03:01.633 --> 03:03.600
We think you oughta go for it.

03:03.666 --> 03:05.200
Go for what?

03:05.266 --> 03:06.533
One night stand.

03:06.600 --> 03:08.766
One last blast
before you disappear

03:08.833 --> 03:10.933
beyond the valley of monogamy.

03:12.366 --> 03:13.933
I haven't.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.333
Well, not since I met Jessica.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.800
Think of yourself
as a long distance trucker

03:17.866 --> 03:21.100
and this is your last gas
for 200 miles.

03:23.533 --> 03:25.433
Guys, I don't think so.

03:57.800 --> 03:58.733
Ow!

04:09.833 --> 04:11.733
'Jess is nervous.'

04:11.800 --> 04:14.033
Her parents had
a lousy marriage.

04:14.100 --> 04:17.100
- She wants ours to be great.
- Not a problem.

04:17.166 --> 04:19.966
Just wave my magic wand
and turn you into..

04:20.033 --> 04:21.166
...Ken and Barbie.

04:24.333 --> 04:25.933
I'm 22.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.366
I keep thinking,
maybe, I'm too young.

04:29.800 --> 04:31.033
You are.

04:32.066 --> 04:33.100
Yup.

04:33.166 --> 04:34.666
I've never been very good
at commit..

04:34.733 --> 04:35.900
Commitment.

04:35.966 --> 04:38.500
As a kid, you couldn't stick
to a paper route.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.633
I keep having these
bad dreams about it.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.133
Just wait till they start
becoming real. Ha ha.

04:47.266 --> 04:49.166
Come on, man.

04:49.233 --> 04:51.200
For richer or poorer..

04:52.500 --> 04:54.666
Better, for worse.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.100
You're right!

05:02.166 --> 05:03.500
Damn it, I'll do it!

05:03.566 --> 05:05.466
- One last fling.
- Oh.

05:05.533 --> 05:07.233
The triumph of male hormones!

05:26.233 --> 05:30.200
It's time for our boy
to face the music

05:30.266 --> 05:32.200
with rap master.

05:32.266 --> 05:33.200
Ready!

05:37.233 --> 05:39.833
I don't do it with married men.

05:39.900 --> 05:42.133
Hey, I'm not married yet.

05:42.200 --> 05:43.666
Try my friend, JJ.

05:43.733 --> 05:45.533
She specializes in your type.

05:57.766 --> 05:59.700
- Wow!
- Hot stuff.

06:37.300 --> 06:39.200
I have to take a number?
For what?

06:54.733 --> 06:55.700
Next.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.533
Two can play that game.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.200
- 'Hey!'
- 'Hey, buddy!'

07:11.633 --> 07:13.233
- 'Whoo!'
- 'Alright.'

07:16.400 --> 07:17.700
Hey, you set me up.

07:19.433 --> 07:21.433
Hey, last gas for 200 miles.

07:48.466 --> 07:50.233
Can't go yet.

07:50.300 --> 07:52.066
We have a surprise for you

07:52.133 --> 07:53.800
'Boys, check this out.'

07:55.533 --> 07:57.900
- You're gonna love this.
- 'Yeah!'

08:00.633 --> 08:05.300
Okay, gang, this is Gavin'
last night as a single man

08:05.366 --> 08:08.366
'To help make this
a memorable occasion'

08:08.433 --> 08:10.200
we have invited a woman

08:10.266 --> 08:12.100
whose stimulating talents

08:12.166 --> 08:15.233
has been known to raise
the World Trade Tower

08:15.300 --> 08:16.833
two stories.

08:17.900 --> 08:19.233
'Presenting..'

08:19.300 --> 08:21.300
...the stripper from hell.

08:32.433 --> 08:33.633
Yeah, baby!

08:41.333 --> 08:42.800
- 'Alright!'
- 'Ow!'

08:46.700 --> 08:48.733
Guys, this is
kind of uncomfortable.

08:48.800 --> 08:49.966
What's wrong?

08:50.033 --> 08:51.800
Getting a little hot?

09:00.166 --> 09:04.266
Now, boys and girls,
thereal&lt;

09:04.333 --> 09:06.566
is about to begin.

09:28.400 --> 09:32.000
'Well, what should we
strip off first?'

09:35.500 --> 09:39.966
How about we strip away
poor Gavin's delusions?

09:40.033 --> 09:41.566
- 'Alright.'
- 'Yeah. Yeah.'

09:44.766 --> 09:46.300
- 'Go!'
- 'Take it out, come on.'

09:46.366 --> 09:50.700
Gavin here, thinks he might be
afraid of a little commitment.

09:50.766 --> 09:52.533
- 'What?'
- 'Ooh!'

09:54.600 --> 09:57.600
Strip! Strip!
Strip! Strip!

09:57.666 --> 10:01.133
What he's really afraid of
is intimacy.

10:01.200 --> 10:02.933
- 'Ah.'
- 'Oh, yeah?'

10:03.000 --> 10:05.633
He doesn't know how to be close.

10:05.700 --> 10:07.700
Boo!

10:07.766 --> 10:10.833
He's also afraid
of responsibility.

10:10.900 --> 10:12.933
'Yeah!'

10:14.866 --> 10:18.033
You should see him buckle
when the going gets tough.

10:19.533 --> 10:21.433
'Boo!'

10:26.733 --> 10:29.033
We know he's afraid
of sexual boredom.

10:29.966 --> 10:31.966
But did you also know

10:32.033 --> 10:35.200
he doesn't have the stomach
to be unfaithful?

10:35.266 --> 10:37.100
- 'What?'
- 'Oh!'

10:40.300 --> 10:43.066
You gotta work
on that, handsome.

10:43.133 --> 10:45.433
I know a lot of girls
who'll be glad

10:45.500 --> 10:49.300
to enroll you in
the disease-of-the-month club.

10:51.900 --> 10:53.866
Time to strip it all the way!

10:53.933 --> 10:54.966
- 'Alright!'
- 'Yeah!'

10:55.033 --> 10:56.200
- 'Take it off!'
- 'Take it off!'

10:56.266 --> 10:58.300
- 'Take it off!'
- 'More!'

11:17.100 --> 11:19.866
You're afraid
she'll become her mother.

11:19.933 --> 11:22.833
You're afraid she'll want
children before you're ready.

11:22.900 --> 11:24.066
- 'Yeah.'
- 'That's right.'

11:24.133 --> 11:26.200
'You are afraid she'll get fat'

11:26.266 --> 11:28.566
and spend your money
and drive you mad

11:28.633 --> 11:32.700
with the mindless, tedious,
soul destroying details

11:32.766 --> 11:35.233
of the life in the
ultimate slow lane.

11:36.433 --> 11:38.433
We're talking marriage, Gavin.

11:39.566 --> 11:43.400
The long slow
treadmill to death!

11:48.533 --> 11:52.600
Hope you've enjoyed your last
night of freedom, Gavy baby.

11:52.666 --> 11:54.400
I love her, dammit!

11:54.466 --> 11:56.100
I love her.

11:56.166 --> 11:59.100
Then you'd better learn
how to stand up to your fears.

11:59.166 --> 12:00.733
- 'Yeah.'
- 'That's right.'

12:03.366 --> 12:04.333
Hit it, boys.

12:04.400 --> 12:05.866
- 'Yeah.'
- 'Yeah.'

12:21.366 --> 12:23.300
'You look like
death warmed over.'

12:35.800 --> 12:37.733
You like your surprise?

12:41.266 --> 12:43.233
'I got it for our honeymoon.'

12:44.966 --> 12:47.300
How.. H-how did I get home?

12:50.633 --> 12:52.666
Your so called best men
dropped you on the doorstep

12:52.733 --> 12:54.733
rang the bell and ran away.

12:57.200 --> 13:00.533
Oh, you look beautiful.

13:01.866 --> 13:03.900
How was last night?

13:04.966 --> 13:06.600
I'm glad it's over.

13:06.666 --> 13:08.033
What do you mean it's..

13:08.100 --> 13:10.300
Have you given it any thought
to what I said?

13:12.233 --> 13:14.900
About calling off the marriage.

13:14.966 --> 13:17.066
Jess, look..

13:17.133 --> 13:19.866
...I won't be a perfect husband.

13:19.933 --> 13:22.400
Hell, I won't even come close.

13:22.466 --> 13:25.000
But I'll give it my best shot.

13:25.066 --> 13:27.033
'I'll work at it.'

13:28.433 --> 13:31.633
Jess, I wanna spend
my life with you.

14:04.733 --> 14:06.900
Look, I'm marrying your daughter
because I love her

14:06.966 --> 14:08.500
not because I want a promotion.

14:08.566 --> 14:10.400
Hmm, whether you like it or not

14:10.466 --> 14:12.733
you're now vice president
in charge of marketing.

14:12.800 --> 14:14.900
I'm not ready, sir, I mean,
perhaps in a couple of years--

14:14.966 --> 14:17.733
I am not having my son-in-law
kick around the bullpen

14:17.800 --> 14:18.933
with the other phone jockeys.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.433
Jessica's waiting
for us, David--

14:20.500 --> 14:22.866
She can wait five more minutes.

14:22.933 --> 14:25.200
You're also getting
a $20,000 raise.

14:25.266 --> 14:28.500
- Mr. Jordan, I don't--
- I don't like you much, Gavin.

14:28.566 --> 14:32.133
But you're at least one step up
from Jessica's usual parade

14:32.200 --> 14:34.700
of morons from outer space.

14:36.333 --> 14:38.266
'Well, thanks for
the vote of confidence.'

14:38.333 --> 14:40.433
'Oh, you turned out alright.'

14:40.500 --> 14:43.566
'Eventually I'll whip you
into shape.'

14:43.633 --> 14:45.633
'I've got somethin'
to look forward to, sir.'

14:45.700 --> 14:47.633
'And so do I.'

14:47.700 --> 14:50.966
'Paying for this
whole damn affair.'

14:51.033 --> 14:53.200
'Jessica's in that little
cubicle, waiting for us.'

14:53.266 --> 14:55.133
She must be
very nervous. Please.

14:55.200 --> 14:57.266
Dammit, Marianne,
it's bad enough I had to cancel

14:57.333 --> 14:59.633
my Saturday golf game for this.

14:59.700 --> 15:01.933
Why couldn't you elope?

15:02.000 --> 15:04.133
I guess Jessica thought
you'd enjoy giving her away.

15:06.866 --> 15:08.800
Let's get this over with.

16:24.700 --> 16:25.966
Dearly beloved

16:26.033 --> 16:28.300
we are gathered here
in the sight of God

16:28.366 --> 16:29.833
to join this couple

16:29.900 --> 16:31.933
Gavin Nicholas Evans

16:32.000 --> 16:34.400
'and Jessica Molly Jordan'

16:34.466 --> 16:37.100
'in the bounds
of holy matrimony.'

16:37.166 --> 16:40.633
'The union of husband and wife
is intended by God'

16:40.700 --> 16:42.600
'for their mutual joy'

16:42.666 --> 16:46.133
'for the help and comfort
given one another in prosperity'

16:46.200 --> 16:49.466
and adversity,
and when it's God's will

16:49.533 --> 16:51.433
'for the procreation
of children.'

17:46.433 --> 17:48.433
'They're gonna cut the cake.'

17:56.833 --> 17:58.833
Happy ever after.

17:59.633 --> 18:01.666
Happy ever after.

18:01.733 --> 18:03.133
Ow!

18:38.766 --> 18:40.933
Well, we haven't made love
in two weeks.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.933
Oh, it can't be that long.

18:43.766 --> 18:47.000
Actually it's 15 days, 11 hours.

18:48.233 --> 18:50.233
Why are we so busy
all the time?

18:52.233 --> 18:54.400
We just have to find
room for it.

18:56.700 --> 18:59.366
How about Thursday, the 19th?

18:59.433 --> 19:02.066
- Give me a break.
- Wait a second, wait a second.

19:02.133 --> 19:03.600
Let's make it Friday, the 20th.

19:03.666 --> 19:05.700
I'll be at maximum ovulation.

19:11.266 --> 19:13.233
I'm going out tonight.

19:17.366 --> 19:18.466
With who?

19:18.533 --> 19:21.066
Danny and David.

19:21.133 --> 19:22.300
Where?

19:22.366 --> 19:24.700
Do I need your permission?

19:24.766 --> 19:28.033
Gavin, I don't mind,
I'm just curious.

19:28.100 --> 19:29.700
I mean, this is the first time
I've been out by myself

19:29.766 --> 19:32.333
since our honeymoon, six weeks.

19:32.400 --> 19:33.933
You don't have to justify it.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.833
Yeah, but you're hurt,
aren't you?

19:35.900 --> 19:38.200
Just by the tone of your voice.

19:38.266 --> 19:39.833
I mean, you're always
asking me where I've been.

19:39.900 --> 19:41.333
You're always asking me
when I'll be back.

19:41.400 --> 19:44.266
You never used to be like this.

19:44.333 --> 19:46.633
You used to come home at 5:00.
Now, you come home at 8:00.

19:46.700 --> 19:48.533
Well, that's your
father's fault.

19:48.600 --> 19:49.933
You used to be romantic.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.400
Now, you never kiss me
unless you want sex.

19:52.466 --> 19:53.466
Yeah.

19:53.533 --> 19:55.466
And I used to get
homemade fettuccine.

19:55.533 --> 19:57.933
Now, all I get is Lean Cuisine
in the microwave.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.900
What happened to the flowers
you used to bring me?

20:00.966 --> 20:02.600
Why don't you ever
wear dress anymore?

20:02.666 --> 20:04.833
All I ever see you in
is sweatpants.

20:04.900 --> 20:06.866
Go, get out!
Get out of here!

20:06.933 --> 20:08.533
I'm gone.

20:25.066 --> 20:27.300
Firm, blonde..

20:27.366 --> 20:28.500
We could've use you, Gavin

20:28.566 --> 20:30.400
I mean, we had our hands full.

20:30.466 --> 20:31.966
Why can't my life
be that shallow?

20:32.033 --> 20:34.733
How's the wedding ring getting,
a little tight?

20:34.800 --> 20:36.833
Too tight.

20:36.900 --> 20:39.433
In fact it feels like
it's glued on.

20:39.500 --> 20:42.533
I'm planning to amputate
the damn finger.

20:42.600 --> 20:44.600
Maybe I can help.

20:58.300 --> 21:00.300
I'd say you owe me a drink

21:05.633 --> 21:07.200
You were at my wedding.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.100
I live next door
to the church.

21:10.033 --> 21:12.133
I'm a wedding crasher.

21:12.200 --> 21:14.600
I cry at every one of them
it's better than therapy.

21:15.800 --> 21:17.866
- What's your name?
- Red.

21:17.933 --> 21:18.900
Just red.

21:18.966 --> 21:20.533
Well, I can see why.

21:22.066 --> 21:24.533
I can feel some chemistry
happening here.

21:25.833 --> 21:28.433
Ring may be in my pocket,
but I'm still married.

21:28.500 --> 21:30.633
But you're not happy, are you?

21:30.700 --> 21:32.933
I love Jessica.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Just hate what marriage
does to me.

21:35.933 --> 21:37.833
Come home with me.

21:37.900 --> 21:40.366
We can talk about it.

21:40.433 --> 21:42.133
Hey, no strings attached.

21:42.200 --> 21:44.133
You can back out
any time you like.

21:58.800 --> 22:00.833
I think this might be a mistake.

22:02.066 --> 22:04.400
Oh, don't let my isolation tank
scare you.

22:04.466 --> 22:07.933
It's great for, uh, meditation.

22:10.200 --> 22:11.233
Have a seat.

22:16.466 --> 22:19.933
Why don't you tell me
all about lovely Jessica?

22:20.000 --> 22:22.033
We're gonna have
so much more fun later

22:22.100 --> 22:24.666
if you get her
off your chest now.

22:24.733 --> 22:25.933
Hmm?

22:28.600 --> 22:30.866
Trouble is, I love her.

22:30.933 --> 22:32.900
Then why are you here with me?

22:33.700 --> 22:36.266
Do you like me too?

22:36.333 --> 22:39.233
I think he's tons better
than Stephen King.

22:39.300 --> 22:40.533
Hmm?

22:42.566 --> 22:44.433
I'm here because..

22:45.666 --> 22:48.166
I don't know.

22:48.233 --> 22:50.533
I guess I needed
someone to talk to.

22:50.600 --> 22:52.633
My favorite's
"Beyond Good and Evil."

22:52.700 --> 22:54.600
Now there's a real page-turner.

22:56.500 --> 22:58.266
You didn't come here to talk.

22:58.333 --> 22:59.600
Be honest, hmm?

22:59.666 --> 23:02.100
But you said that,
no strings are attached--

23:02.166 --> 23:03.833
If you were really interested
in saving your marriage

23:03.900 --> 23:05.366
you'd be talking to your wife.

23:05.433 --> 23:07.300
You'd be going
to a marriage counsellor.

23:07.366 --> 23:08.500
You'd be fighting
to get the romance

23:08.566 --> 23:09.533
back in your marriage.

23:09.600 --> 23:11.533
I'd better go.

23:16.200 --> 23:18.933
A typical new husband.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.233
As soon as the going gets tough

23:21.300 --> 23:23.800
you put on your track shoes
and you take off.

23:25.066 --> 23:26.533
I thought you'd be
more compassionate.

23:26.600 --> 23:28.600
Enerchi didn't believe
in compassion.

23:28.666 --> 23:30.033
He believed in assertion.

23:30.100 --> 23:31.900
So assert yourself.

23:37.800 --> 23:39.200
Where's the key?

23:39.266 --> 23:43.200
The key is in being patient...
and loyal.

23:43.266 --> 23:45.300
Otherwise, marriage
is a death trap.

23:46.700 --> 23:48.833
And I think you've
already blown it.

23:52.033 --> 23:54.033
What the hell is going on?

23:57.966 --> 23:59.900
The perfect solution.

23:59.966 --> 24:02.266
Oh, don't worry,
I already hired someone to kill

24:02.333 --> 24:04.433
your sweet little

24:19.166 --> 24:21.100
You're gonna adore
being my slave.

24:22.166 --> 24:24.966
No commitment,
no responsibility.

24:25.033 --> 24:27.200
No intimacy.

24:27.266 --> 24:29.233
And no love.

24:35.466 --> 24:38.200
'And do you
Gavin Nicholas Evans'

24:38.266 --> 24:41.833
take Jessica for
your lawful wedded wife?

24:41.900 --> 24:43.300
Well, do you?

24:44.733 --> 24:46.233
I do. I do.

24:46.300 --> 24:48.933
Then I'm pleased
to pronounce you man and wife.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.300
Feel free to kiss the bride.

25:20.400 --> 25:22.833
If you thought romance was dead

25:22.900 --> 25:25.200
now you know who to blame.

25:27.500 --> 25:29.000
She loves me!

25:31.200 --> 25:33.700
She loves me not!

25:33.766 --> 25:36.233
She loves me!

25:36.300 --> 25:40.033
She loves me not!

26:22.866 --> 26:24.466
Honeymoon's over, Mrs. Evans.

26:24.533 --> 26:26.600
Oh, put me down
before you break your back

26:26.666 --> 26:28.766
Well, who asked you
to eat your way across Hawaii?

26:28.833 --> 26:31.966
Oh, what's the matter, lover,
you want skin and bones?

26:32.033 --> 26:34.000
Or you want voluptuous?

26:36.466 --> 26:39.300
Did I ever tell you
my sure cure for jet lag?

26:49.166 --> 26:51.100
This is the newly-wed game,
we're ready.

26:59.566 --> 27:01.633
If you say so, dad.

27:02.766 --> 27:04.800
What's wrong?

27:06.200 --> 27:07.966
We've been ordered over
for dinner tonight.

27:08.033 --> 27:09.400
Command performance.

27:09.466 --> 27:11.266
I'm sure he didn't
put it that way.

27:11.333 --> 27:12.966
I've been home for&lt;i
and already he's back

27:13.033 --> 27:14.466
making my life miserable!

27:14.533 --> 27:17.166
Hey, you're his daughter.

27:17.233 --> 27:19.233
That's his job.

27:19.300 --> 27:21.800
I'm married, now.
He has no power over me anymore!

27:21.866 --> 27:24.233
Hey, look, I know
you two don't get along

27:24.300 --> 27:26.466
but maybe tonight
you can make a new start!

27:26.533 --> 27:27.766
I mean, you gotta
stop freakin' out

27:27.833 --> 27:29.800
every time he pushes
one of your buttons.

27:29.866 --> 27:31.833
Don't youdare
take his side, Gavin!

27:31.900 --> 27:33.933
Don't you dare!

27:52.533 --> 27:53.966
'Dad?'

27:54.033 --> 27:55.000
'Dad?'

27:56.600 --> 27:58.633
You're up to something, dad,
I heard it in your voice.

27:58.700 --> 27:59.933
I'm busy, Jessica.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.466
I wanna know what it is!

28:01.533 --> 28:03.833
You'll find out tonight.

28:03.900 --> 28:05.700
Something's wrong, isn't it?

28:05.766 --> 28:07.266
Is it medical?

28:07.333 --> 28:08.666
Nobody's dying.

28:08.733 --> 28:10.733
Don't start spending
your inheritance.

28:11.833 --> 28:13.500
Then it's something
between you and mom.

28:13.566 --> 28:14.933
Don't push it.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.266
I hate when you
keep secrets from me, dad!

28:17.333 --> 28:18.833
Just be here tonight.

28:18.900 --> 28:20.400
7:00, sharp.

28:20.466 --> 28:22.900
I hate when you threaten me
like I'm still a little child!

28:22.966 --> 28:24.933
Then grow up, Jessica.

28:26.566 --> 28:28.700
Live your own life.

28:28.766 --> 28:31.433
Stop being so damn obsessed
with your parents.

29:50.366 --> 29:52.966
Not bad for 40, huh?

29:53.033 --> 29:55.066
I don't know why
you chose me, baby

29:55.133 --> 29:57.033
'but you're gonna
have a good time.'

30:00.600 --> 30:02.533
You don't talk much, do you?

30:13.033 --> 30:15.000
Now I get it.

30:15.700 --> 30:17.866
You like to play games.

30:17.933 --> 30:20.733
Come on, baby, let's get
this shuttle in orbit.

30:24.500 --> 30:26.900
Hey, what are you doin'?

30:26.966 --> 30:28.933
Why're you getting dressed

30:34.700 --> 30:36.900
You know, I bet you're married.

30:36.966 --> 30:38.933
You saw my ring, so what?

30:43.566 --> 30:45.233
How many kids?

30:45.300 --> 30:47.300
One? Two?

30:53.033 --> 30:54.633
'Oh, you better
think again, baby.'

30:54.700 --> 30:56.666
'You don't know who
you're screwin' with.'

31:04.733 --> 31:06.033
You want money?

31:06.100 --> 31:08.766
What is this, a rip-off?

31:08.833 --> 31:10.800
Just your home number.

31:14.433 --> 31:15.700
You're dead, little girl.

31:20.933 --> 31:22.700
Excuse me, ma'am.

31:22.766 --> 31:24.633
Well, did you know
your husband's cheating on you?

31:24.700 --> 31:26.633
You are dead, bitch!

31:29.966 --> 31:32.233
You'll find him at
the Springwood Park Hotel.

31:33.666 --> 31:35.633
Bridal suite.

33:14.300 --> 33:16.900
Pop! Ha ha! Goes the weasel.

33:16.966 --> 33:18.300
Now, that's the kind
of song that'll

33:18.366 --> 33:21.600
really carve
a place in your heart, hmm.

33:32.133 --> 33:34.233
Mommy, is that you?

34:18.766 --> 34:21.100
Daddy, who's that lady?

34:21.900 --> 34:23.833
And where's mommy?

34:23.900 --> 34:25.333
'You bad girl.'

34:25.400 --> 34:27.200
'I'm getting the paddle!'

35:29.033 --> 35:31.433
'I'm not going to
spank you, Jessica.'

35:32.700 --> 35:34.933
Mommy, where are you?

35:35.000 --> 35:37.300
She's not here, now stop this!

35:39.933 --> 35:42.033
I want mommy!

35:49.266 --> 35:53.000
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

36:12.466 --> 36:14.700
I'm scared of the paddle, daddy.

36:14.766 --> 36:17.833
I'm sorry, I'll put it away.

36:21.800 --> 36:23.833
Are you going to punish me?

36:23.900 --> 36:25.933
Not if you can keep a secret.

36:27.966 --> 36:30.333
Mommy told me never,
never to keep secrets.

36:31.133 --> 36:33.100
This is serious, Jessica.

36:35.133 --> 36:36.266
Do you know what will happen

36:36.333 --> 36:39.233
if you tell mommy
about that lady upstairs?

36:40.900 --> 36:44.133
- No.
- Something bad would happen.

36:46.566 --> 36:48.333
Worst than the boogeyman?

36:48.400 --> 36:50.033
Much worse.

36:52.300 --> 36:53.733
What is it?

36:55.066 --> 36:59.666
It's what mommies and daddies
call divorce.

36:59.733 --> 37:03.600
Divorce starts when mommy
and daddy have a big fight

37:08.666 --> 37:10.800
That sounds horrible.

37:10.866 --> 37:13.833
'Then they stop talking
to one another.'

37:17.033 --> 37:20.000
Please, don't let that happen.

37:20.066 --> 37:24.600
'Then mommy or daddy
will move to another house.'

37:28.833 --> 37:32.466
What about me?
What happens to me?

37:32.533 --> 37:35.500
If mommy and daddy
get a divorce..

37:36.566 --> 37:39.200
...we have to share you.

37:39.266 --> 37:41.200
Half and half.

38:03.600 --> 38:05.033
I had that dream.

38:05.733 --> 38:08.733
That same dream.

38:08.800 --> 38:11.333
'You know, this happens every
time you fight with your dad.'

38:13.800 --> 38:15.566
What time is it?

38:15.633 --> 38:18.100
It's time to get dressed,
or we'll be late for dinner.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.500
Maybe we shouldn't go tonight.

38:24.566 --> 38:27.200
I've got a bad feeling
about this.

38:27.266 --> 38:29.366
What your parents gonna do?
Bite you?

38:29.433 --> 38:31.000
You don't understand.

38:32.233 --> 38:34.533
You know, you're right,
I'll never understand.

38:34.600 --> 38:37.333
Why do you let them
drive you crazy?

38:37.400 --> 38:39.866
You act like
you're responsible for them.

38:39.933 --> 38:42.000
Dad sneezes, you get a cold.

38:42.066 --> 38:43.900
Mom gets a headache,
you take the blame.

38:43.966 --> 38:45.100
It's nuts.

38:45.166 --> 38:47.200
Gavin, please back off a bit.

38:48.933 --> 38:50.900
I need your help tonight.

38:53.533 --> 38:54.833
I'm sorry.

38:58.400 --> 38:59.933
You know, truth is, uh

39:00.000 --> 39:02.933
we probably are in
for a very boring evening.

39:06.933 --> 39:08.600
We've made your favorite
tonight, Jessy.

39:08.666 --> 39:09.766
Roast beef, rare.

39:09.833 --> 39:11.600
Hmm, I can taste
the blood already.

39:11.666 --> 39:14.133
Your father's just putting
on the finishing touches.

39:14.200 --> 39:15.633
They're here, dear.

39:17.566 --> 39:19.166
It's about time.

40:01.266 --> 40:03.300
'I'm so full I could die.'

40:05.033 --> 40:07.933
'I'll be glad
to carve you some more.'

40:08.000 --> 40:11.333
'Jessica, do you want your
father to carve you so more?'

40:14.333 --> 40:16.200
I-I guess I'm not hungry.

40:19.566 --> 40:22.000
Um, how about dessert?

40:25.066 --> 40:27.033
I think we should
tell them now, Marianne.

40:30.133 --> 40:32.933
We decided to wait
till after your honeymoon.

40:34.400 --> 40:36.200
...to make this announcement.

40:36.266 --> 40:39.533
Jessie, we didn't wanna
spoil it for you.

40:43.266 --> 40:45.433
Your mother and I
are getting divorced.

40:48.833 --> 40:50.700
'I know there's a
certain irony to this--'

40:50.766 --> 40:53.933
You can't,
I won't let you.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.533
'Jessie, I know
this is hard for you'

40:56.600 --> 40:58.533
'but it's hard for us too.'

40:59.800 --> 41:02.633
I kept my promise, dad.

41:02.700 --> 41:04.533
I didn't say a word.

41:05.533 --> 41:07.100
You have no right to do this!

41:07.166 --> 41:08.900
What are you talking about?

41:08.966 --> 41:10.933
You know damn well
what I'm talking about!

41:13.466 --> 41:17.233
I-I spent my whole life
keeping you two together.

41:21.166 --> 41:23.200
You're not going
to do this to me.

41:25.700 --> 41:27.366
Take it back.

41:27.433 --> 41:28.400
'Jess, what's wrong with you?'

41:28.466 --> 41:30.200
'They're trying to make it easy
for you.'

41:30.266 --> 41:32.866
- Take it back.
- 'Jessie, please.'

41:32.933 --> 41:35.933
Take it back or I'll tell,
I'll tell, I'll tell..

41:36.000 --> 41:37.533
Jess, come on, let's go home.

41:37.600 --> 41:39.433
Jessie, please.

41:39.500 --> 41:44.200
I never told mom
about that lady, dad.

41:45.600 --> 41:50.300
I never told her about
any of your la-la-ladies.

41:51.800 --> 41:54.500
I kept my promise.

41:54.566 --> 41:56.866
Gavin, get her out of here!

41:56.933 --> 41:59.200
Mommy, he made me swear.

41:59.266 --> 42:02.433
Jessie, I knew about
the other women.

42:07.600 --> 42:11.000
- You knew?
- I've always known.

42:31.900 --> 42:34.200
Kill me, kill me!

42:36.133 --> 42:38.200
Your place or mine, baby?

42:45.133 --> 42:47.100
I'm sorry for what I did.

42:48.666 --> 42:50.866
It was a mistake.

42:50.933 --> 42:53.633
I was crazy,
I was mad at my father.

42:53.700 --> 42:57.733
Yeah, I heard your parents
are getting a divorce.

42:57.800 --> 42:59.700
They sure suckered at you,
didn't they?

43:06.533 --> 43:11.000
All those years, it killed you
keeping that secret, didn't it?

43:14.400 --> 43:15.733
Poor little girl.

43:17.800 --> 43:19.700
I'm so scared.

43:20.700 --> 43:22.600
You were always scared.

43:22.666 --> 43:25.200
Guess you saw yourself as
the guardian of their marriage.

43:26.166 --> 43:27.700
Big mistake.

43:33.666 --> 43:35.600
What are you going to do?

43:37.366 --> 43:39.400
Hey, your folks
are getting a divorce.

43:42.100 --> 43:45.400
Just like you always do.

43:45.466 --> 43:47.633
'A thing like that
can really cut a girl.'

43:57.133 --> 43:58.066
No!

44:04.766 --> 44:07.400
'I know, doctor, I just wanted
to see her for a second.'

44:11.866 --> 44:13.333
I can't stand it.

44:13.400 --> 44:15.633
'It happens every time
she looks at me.'

44:17.433 --> 44:19.433
Jess, please..

44:19.500 --> 44:20.600
Jessie, please.

44:23.533 --> 44:26.800
No. Get away! Get away!

44:29.900 --> 44:31.533
Get away!

44:35.766 --> 44:38.366
The ties that bind.

44:38.433 --> 44:39.666
Ha ha ha.

44:39.733 --> 44:42.633
The chains of love..

44:42.700 --> 44:46.500
...unbreakable, indestructible.

44:49.200 --> 44:51.533
And tasty too.
