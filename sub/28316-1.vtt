<i>"And a woman who held
a babe against her bosom said,</i>

00:43.801 --> 00:45.870
<i>'Speak to us of Children.'</i>

00:46.369 --> 00:47.704
<i>And he said:</i>

00:48.005 --> 00:50.842
<i>Your children
are not your children.</i>

00:51.375 --> 00:55.679
<i>They are the sons and daughters
of Life's longing for itself.</i>

00:56.546 --> 00:59.317
<i>They come through you
but not from you.</i>

01:00.317 --> 01:04.289
<i>And though they are with you,
yet they belong not to you.</i>

01:05.722 --> 01:09.293
<i>You may give them your love
but not your thoughts,</i>

01:09.959 --> 01:12.262
<i>for they have
their own thoughts.</i>

01:13.263 --> 01:16.833
<i>You may house their bodies
but not their souls,</i>

01:17.801 --> 01:20.972
<i>for their souls dwell
in the house of tomorrow,</i>

01:21.638 --> 01:26.210
<i>which you cannot visit,
not even in your dreams.</i>

01:27.444 --> 01:29.945
<i>You may strive to be like them,</i>

01:29.947 --> 01:32.650
<i>but seek not
to make them like you.</i>

01:33.349 --> 01:37.321
<i>For life goes not backwards
nor tarries with yesterday.</i>

01:38.756 --> 01:43.861
<i>You are the bows from which your
children as living arrows are sent forth.</i>

01:44.828 --> 01:48.365
<i>The archer sees the mark
upon the path of the infinite,</i>

01:49.465 --> 01:51.565
<i>and He bends you with His might</i>

01:51.567 --> 01:54.572
<i>that His arrows
may go swift and far.</i>

01:55.605 --> 01:59.009
<i>Let your bending in the
archer's hand be for gladness,</i>

01:59.942 --> 02:02.646
<i>for even as He loves
the arrow that flies,</i>

02:04.381 --> 02:07.685
<i>so He loves also
the bow that is stable."</i>

02:23.967 --> 02:26.802
All the women in my
family have had boys first.

02:26.804 --> 02:29.905
I'm carrying low,
I've had no morning sickness.

02:30.873 --> 02:32.006
What?

02:32.008 --> 02:33.741
He's a boy.

02:33.743 --> 02:34.912
A mother knows.

02:37.381 --> 02:38.647
What's going on here?

02:38.649 --> 02:39.717
Don't know.

02:41.117 --> 02:41.985
Pass me the satnav.

02:43.721 --> 02:46.491
Just follow the diversion.
Got nowhere to be.

02:47.623 --> 02:48.558
Okay.

03:02.406 --> 03:04.575
- Again?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

03:15.919 --> 03:18.720
It is a privilege to witness

03:18.722 --> 03:24.094
this extraordinary species
in her most natural habitat.

03:25.027 --> 03:25.962
Matt!

03:28.498 --> 03:29.433
Stop it.

03:31.801 --> 03:34.803
As you can see,
it isn't wise to get too close,

03:34.805 --> 03:38.006
so I think we should take
this opportunity and back off.

03:53.924 --> 03:55.126
Matt, look out!

04:02.566 --> 04:04.198
Are you okay?
Babe, are you okay?

04:04.200 --> 04:06.103
- I'm fine. We're fine.
- Are you sure?

04:09.006 --> 04:11.205
I took my eyes off the road.
I'm so sorry.

04:11.207 --> 04:13.076
It's okay. We're okay.

04:13.576 --> 04:14.846
You weren't going that fast.

04:59.723 --> 05:00.725
Careful.

05:13.803 --> 05:14.871
Anything?

05:17.240 --> 05:19.576
No. Just giving it a second.

05:36.059 --> 05:36.994
What is it?

05:37.860 --> 05:39.930
It's like a farm
or something over there.

05:40.764 --> 05:42.130
How far?

05:42.132 --> 05:43.834
About half a mile.

06:44.595 --> 06:46.664
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm all right.

07:04.081 --> 07:05.550
This is private land!

07:08.619 --> 07:10.755
We had an accident.
Wondered if you could help.

07:11.053 --> 07:12.756
Did you not hear what I said?

07:14.257 --> 07:17.158
This is private land.
Now on your way.

07:17.160 --> 07:20.127
I know. I'm really sorry, but
we crashed into a fallen tree

07:20.129 --> 07:23.031
and we are totally stranded,
so if I could just use your phone,

07:23.033 --> 07:24.235
I'd be so grateful.

07:25.369 --> 07:28.639
Can't help you.
Now, I've asked you nicely.

07:29.172 --> 07:30.241
Leave.

07:30.874 --> 07:34.041
Look, my wife
is heavily pregnant.

07:34.043 --> 07:35.680
I'd really appreciate your help.

07:36.646 --> 07:37.848
Guilty as charged.

07:41.317 --> 07:42.286
Boy or girl?

07:42.819 --> 07:43.888
Boy.

07:44.887 --> 07:47.257
Well, why didn't you say?

07:47.690 --> 07:49.359
Let's see if I get
you folks some help.

07:52.762 --> 07:53.697
Agnes.

07:58.168 --> 07:59.103
<i>Yeah.</i>

08:00.036 --> 08:02.305
Agnes, get the china out,
we've got guests.

08:03.740 --> 08:06.210
<i>Bob, stop it. You know
it's wash day, I'm busy.</i>

08:06.877 --> 08:09.844
Agnes, just stop what you're
doing for a wee minute.

08:09.846 --> 08:13.214
I'm bringing this lovely young lady
up to the house, and her husband.

08:13.216 --> 08:15.416
They've had a wee accident,
you see?

08:15.418 --> 08:16.387
The car's broken down.

08:18.422 --> 08:20.954
<i>Bob, I've not got time
for your nonsense today.</i>

08:20.956 --> 08:22.289
<i>I've got too much to do.</i>

08:22.291 --> 08:23.860
Agnes, just...

08:24.894 --> 08:25.962
She's pregnant.

08:27.764 --> 08:29.000
It's a boy, Agnes.

08:31.901 --> 08:33.638
<i>What you waiting for?
Bring them up.</i>

08:45.215 --> 08:47.317
What a stroke of luck
you finding the farm.

08:47.717 --> 08:50.451
We'll get you a nice,
cozy bed and plenty to eat.

08:50.453 --> 08:51.953
Come on, jump in!

08:51.955 --> 08:53.754
That is really kind
of you,

08:53.756 --> 08:55.290
but we wouldn't want to impose.

08:55.292 --> 08:56.961
We just need to use your phone.

08:57.961 --> 09:00.462
The trouble is, the storm
blew down all the lines.

09:00.464 --> 09:02.964
We're waiting for an engineer,
but all the roads are blocked.

09:02.966 --> 09:04.769
There's trees down everywhere.

09:05.034 --> 09:07.301
How about somewhere we might
be able to grab a taxi?

09:07.303 --> 09:08.338
Taxi?

09:08.938 --> 09:10.774
No taxis around here,
I'm afraid.

09:11.441 --> 09:13.711
Don't worry.
We'll get it sorted.

09:14.009 --> 09:15.278
Come on, jump in.

09:19.783 --> 09:20.884
You go first.

09:21.384 --> 09:22.286
Okay.

09:30.994 --> 09:33.197
My wife's gonna be
over the moon to see you.

09:34.029 --> 09:35.365
She loves babies.

10:25.514 --> 10:26.850
There they are.

10:27.517 --> 10:29.086
The welcoming committee.

10:40.029 --> 10:43.297
Hello. Hello. Welcome.

10:43.299 --> 10:44.932
You poor souls.

10:44.934 --> 10:47.134
Welcome, welcome.

10:47.136 --> 10:49.205
- I'm Agnes as you know.
- Hello.

10:50.606 --> 10:52.909
What a blessing
to have you here.

10:53.943 --> 10:56.210
Let's get you inside and fed.

10:56.212 --> 10:58.012
I just need my bag.

10:58.014 --> 11:00.017
David, Luke,
fetch the bags, will you?

11:02.519 --> 11:03.453
Hello.

11:13.964 --> 11:15.162
Just the two bags?

11:15.164 --> 11:16.366
It's okay. I can manage them.

11:18.467 --> 11:20.270
Not too heavy.

11:38.989 --> 11:40.291
Here we are.

11:43.293 --> 11:45.126
Honestly, we are so grateful,

11:45.128 --> 11:47.060
but we need
to find somewhere with a phone.

11:47.062 --> 11:49.397
Oh, no. I won't hear of it.

11:49.399 --> 11:51.936
It's way too late
to go around knocking on doors.

11:52.269 --> 11:54.002
Won't be good for the baby.

11:54.004 --> 11:55.570
No. We'll find you
a phone tomorrow.

11:55.572 --> 11:57.006
Don't you worry.

11:57.340 --> 11:58.940
You'll sleep very well
in here.

11:58.942 --> 12:01.245
These beds are very comfy.

12:01.543 --> 12:04.478
The bathroom is just along
the corridor to the right,

12:04.480 --> 12:07.350
and dinner will be in an hour,
but I'll give you a call.

12:08.018 --> 12:09.386
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

12:14.990 --> 12:16.526
- What the f...
- Shh!

12:17.559 --> 12:19.229
What just happened?

12:20.230 --> 12:22.265
It's like an episode
of <i>The Twilight Zone.</i>

12:23.066 --> 12:24.464
The original series.

12:24.466 --> 12:27.267
I know.

12:27.269 --> 12:29.203
Their clothes and everything.

12:29.205 --> 12:30.139
Bless them.

12:31.341 --> 12:33.576
Well, you did say you
wanted to get away from it all.

12:34.443 --> 12:38.014
Yeah, into the countryside,
not the 1950s.

12:42.552 --> 12:44.388
Beautiful views, though.

12:47.123 --> 12:48.192
Oh, yeah.

12:49.558 --> 12:51.394
Don't you think
the two sons look a bit...

12:52.461 --> 12:54.130
nothing like each other?

12:55.097 --> 12:57.533
Hmm. Adopted, maybe?

12:58.301 --> 13:00.371
And the girl in the woods.
Did you see her?

13:01.236 --> 13:03.503
- No.
- That's why I looked at you in the car.

13:03.505 --> 13:06.206
There was this little girl,
staring at us in the woods.

13:06.208 --> 13:07.343
Really freaky.

13:07.610 --> 13:08.611
Huh.

13:09.678 --> 13:11.981
First thing in the morning,
we are out of here.

13:12.381 --> 13:13.982
Even if we have to walk.

13:32.434 --> 13:33.937
Will you just relax?

13:35.270 --> 13:37.307
It's either this
or sleeping in the car.

13:47.683 --> 13:49.352
- What is it?
- It's that girl again.

13:53.623 --> 13:55.359
Well, of course she's gone now.

13:58.293 --> 14:00.094
Dinner's served!

14:12.408 --> 14:14.577
Here they are. Come in, come in.

14:19.581 --> 14:21.250
That's right, take a seat.

14:23.052 --> 14:24.587
You're in for a treat.

14:25.054 --> 14:29.225
We're having vegetable soup
for star... David! Manners.

14:31.126 --> 14:34.195
Very sorry. I'm sure you can
tell we're not used to guests.

14:34.197 --> 14:37.301
So, soup for starters.
Followed by roast lamb.

14:37.567 --> 14:40.068
Freshly slaughtered,
especially for you.

14:40.070 --> 14:41.401
- Isn't that right, Bob?
- Aye.

14:41.403 --> 14:42.837
Barely an hour ago.

14:42.839 --> 14:44.708
Still warm when it
went in the oven.

14:45.107 --> 14:47.374
And that'll be with
roast potatoes and vegetables,

14:47.376 --> 14:48.644
freshly picked today.

14:53.716 --> 14:55.385
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

15:13.436 --> 15:15.236
- There we are.
- Thank you.

15:15.238 --> 15:17.537
Greedy boys.

15:17.539 --> 15:19.543
I'm very proud of my boys.

15:21.177 --> 15:23.447
Fine specimens, don't you think?

15:25.447 --> 15:26.682
Yes. Lovely.

15:29.152 --> 15:31.321
Don't you be getting
any ideas, young lady.

15:32.121 --> 15:33.322
They're my boys.

15:34.289 --> 15:35.558
Don't you forget that.

15:49.239 --> 15:50.507
Bob, please.

15:52.875 --> 15:54.644
We thank you, almighty Lord,

15:55.311 --> 15:57.748
for the wonderful food
you have bestowed upon us,

15:58.280 --> 16:00.817
and for the guests you have
brought through our door.

16:01.618 --> 16:05.322
Who bring with them
the most precious gift of all.

16:06.155 --> 16:08.858
The gift of life.

16:10.793 --> 16:12.160
Amen.

16:12.162 --> 16:13.330
- Amen.
- Amen.

16:16.533 --> 16:17.567
Beautiful.

16:18.368 --> 16:19.570
Thank you, Bob.

16:21.571 --> 16:22.706
You may begin.

16:35.184 --> 16:37.919
So, Bob, how long have
you and Agnes lived here?

16:37.921 --> 16:39.653
I've always lived here.

16:39.655 --> 16:41.858
My great-grandparents
built this house.

16:43.458 --> 16:45.660
- Were they all farmers too?
- No.

16:45.662 --> 16:48.465
Landowners.
Bob's the farmer in the family.

16:51.533 --> 16:52.499
Agnes.

16:52.501 --> 16:53.503
Yes, dear?

16:53.836 --> 16:54.837
Is that your daughter?

16:57.941 --> 16:59.910
Yes. Faith.

17:01.610 --> 17:02.879
I wondered who she was.

17:04.579 --> 17:05.946
She not joining us for dinner?

17:05.949 --> 17:08.685
She might. If we're lucky.

17:10.685 --> 17:12.688
We adopted Faith a while back.

17:13.589 --> 17:15.157
Very sad story.

17:16.425 --> 17:18.895
She was abused
by her birth parents.

17:20.230 --> 17:21.298
Terrible.

17:21.964 --> 17:23.332
Terrible people.

17:25.902 --> 17:28.635
The ordeal left her
virtually mute.

17:28.637 --> 17:30.374
She's such a shy wee thing.

17:30.873 --> 17:32.940
But, thankfully,
God led her to us

17:32.942 --> 17:35.442
and we accepted her as one
of our own, didn't we, Bob?

17:35.444 --> 17:36.946
Yes. Yes we did.

17:37.547 --> 17:39.716
David and Luke are adopted too.

17:43.653 --> 17:47.624
God didn't grant me
the gift of childbirth.

17:48.523 --> 17:50.960
He'd a greater purpose
for me.

17:52.862 --> 17:54.730
And I wouldn't have that
any other way.

17:56.965 --> 17:59.269
Just look at my beautiful boys.

18:08.044 --> 18:10.514
Is there a school in the area?
For Faith?

18:11.847 --> 18:13.616
No child of mine goes to school.

18:14.817 --> 18:17.421
Schools out there aren't
good enough for my children.

18:18.755 --> 18:20.958
There's no better teacher
than a child's mother.

18:22.659 --> 18:25.426
There isn't anything we need
from out there, is there, Bob?

18:25.428 --> 18:27.898
That's true. Everything
we need is right here.

18:28.830 --> 18:30.866
Except cars, right?

18:33.403 --> 18:35.271
We didn't make the Land Rover.

18:36.372 --> 18:37.771
And diesel, and stuff.

18:37.773 --> 18:40.040
What have I told you
about that kind of talk?

18:46.682 --> 18:48.548
Our Luke is quite the rebel.

19:10.972 --> 19:13.409
- Anything?
- No.

19:14.477 --> 19:15.746
Jesus Christ.

19:22.050 --> 19:25.585
"This means that it is not
the children of the flesh

19:25.587 --> 19:27.824
who are the children of God,

19:28.391 --> 19:31.762
but the children of the promise
are counted as offspring."

19:35.064 --> 19:36.767
We need to get
the hell out of here.

19:38.701 --> 19:40.934
We're just gonna have
to sweat it out till morning.

19:40.936 --> 19:43.770
It's not just creepy.
It's beyond that.

19:43.772 --> 19:45.875
There's something sinister
about these people.

19:47.542 --> 19:49.809
They're just odd. Eccentric.

19:49.811 --> 19:52.548
No. There's something
about the little girl. Faith.

19:53.015 --> 19:54.751
Why wasn't she
at the dinner table?

19:55.451 --> 19:57.751
These people
would not qualify for adoption.

19:57.753 --> 19:58.853
No way.

20:23.112 --> 20:24.480
It's an old house.

20:27.416 --> 20:28.951
Come and sit down.

20:34.856 --> 20:36.526
Great.

20:37.058 --> 20:39.160
I need the loo, as per usual.

20:40.863 --> 20:42.696
If I'm not back in five minutes,

20:42.698 --> 20:44.534
you'll know I've been murdered.

21:17.500 --> 21:18.567
What's wrong?

21:20.869 --> 21:22.004
It's Faith.

21:24.240 --> 21:26.041
I can't get her out of my head.

21:28.544 --> 21:30.980
She just seems so familiar.

21:33.648 --> 21:34.917
Come and lie down.

21:48.798 --> 21:50.166
How are you feeling, anyway?

21:51.567 --> 21:52.635
Fine.

21:53.269 --> 21:54.703
Just want to go home now.

22:01.210 --> 22:03.814
We'll be home by tomorrow
lunchtime, I promise.

22:15.892 --> 22:17.093
I love you.

22:22.664 --> 22:23.933
I love you too.

23:05.907 --> 23:07.142
Matt, do you hear that?

23:10.946 --> 23:11.881
Matt?

23:39.375 --> 23:40.544
My...

23:41.143 --> 23:42.144
name...

23:42.778 --> 23:43.712
is...

23:45.381 --> 23:46.913
Ellie Adams!

23:46.915 --> 23:48.248
What? What is it?

23:48.250 --> 23:49.783
We need to get out of here.

23:49.785 --> 23:51.051
Get help.

23:51.053 --> 23:52.620
Rachel, you were dreaming.

23:52.622 --> 23:54.321
Faith is Ellie Adams.

23:54.323 --> 23:56.256
The whole family
went missing. Remember?

23:56.258 --> 23:57.994
They were in the news
for months.

23:59.260 --> 24:01.629
They killed them.
Ellie's parents.

24:01.631 --> 24:03.229
- You were having a nightmare.
- Matt.

24:03.231 --> 24:07.234
Listen to me.
That girl is Ellie Adams.

24:07.236 --> 24:09.205
We need to go. Now.

25:12.768 --> 25:14.004
We need to go.

25:17.338 --> 25:19.038
Thank you for your hospitality,

25:19.040 --> 25:20.710
but we need to be
getting on the road now.

25:22.845 --> 25:23.947
Come on.

25:31.053 --> 25:32.122
What are you doing?

25:36.392 --> 25:39.026
We managed to get a signal,
and we sent out a text.

25:39.028 --> 25:40.396
So people know we are here.

25:49.171 --> 25:51.371
What are you doing?

25:51.373 --> 25:52.909
No! Get away from him!

26:04.353 --> 26:06.456
I said be
careful with the baby.

26:35.785 --> 26:38.017
Oh, there she is.

26:38.019 --> 26:41.191
You just had a big contraction.
No wonder you woke up.

26:49.265 --> 26:53.267
It won't be long now till the
good Lord delivers Jacob to us.

26:53.269 --> 26:55.270
It's so exciting.

26:55.837 --> 26:57.005
Matt!

26:58.339 --> 27:00.474
Where is he? Matt?

27:00.476 --> 27:03.012
Now, now. Come on, dear.

27:03.412 --> 27:04.577
There's no need to yell.

27:04.579 --> 27:06.115
Why are you doing this?

27:07.316 --> 27:09.449
Please, just let us go.

27:09.451 --> 27:11.320
We won't tell anyone,
I promise.

27:12.086 --> 27:13.256
Won't tell them what?

27:15.057 --> 27:16.392
What have you done with him?

27:17.526 --> 27:18.795
Now,

27:19.862 --> 27:24.200
I wasn't for the idea
myself, but Bob was right.

27:24.500 --> 27:27.069
It just wouldn't work.

27:28.336 --> 27:30.272
Though I was quite fond of him.

27:31.105 --> 27:32.375
A fine young man.

27:33.875 --> 27:36.179
He's gone to
a much better place.

27:37.378 --> 27:38.781
God's kingdom.

27:39.914 --> 27:41.049
He's lucky.

27:44.854 --> 27:46.389
What are you talking about?

27:47.522 --> 27:48.991
What have you done?

27:59.300 --> 28:00.369
Matt!

28:27.896 --> 28:30.567
Do you ever wonder what your
actual mum and dad look like?

28:31.901 --> 28:33.169
Shut your cake hole.

28:34.002 --> 28:35.070
Well, do you?

28:36.070 --> 28:37.005
No.

28:39.508 --> 28:40.977
Right, that's deep enough.

28:48.017 --> 28:49.184
Drag him over.

28:57.593 --> 29:01.397
Ever wonder what would've happened
if Mum and Dad hadn't rescued us?

29:02.664 --> 29:05.634
Yeah. We'd be sinners,
just like the rest of them.

29:07.068 --> 29:09.638
Now, shut up,
and let's get this done.

29:10.538 --> 29:12.174
Would be interesting, though,

29:12.473 --> 29:14.409
knowing what they look like,
don't you think?

29:15.176 --> 29:18.615
Luke, Mom and Dad
have devoted their lives to us.

29:19.548 --> 29:21.284
It disrespects them
to talk like that.

29:22.384 --> 29:25.121
You keep it up
and I'll tell them.

29:26.654 --> 29:27.990
Then you'll know about it.

29:33.394 --> 29:36.296
- What you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

29:36.298 --> 29:39.099
- You'll get blood on the clothes.
- Mum won't let us wear them.

29:39.101 --> 29:40.904
We can wear them in the fields.

30:15.237 --> 30:16.306
Wait.

30:18.173 --> 30:19.375
Put him in alive.

31:31.212 --> 31:32.147
Wait.

31:33.714 --> 31:36.118
In case he wants a cigarette
when he wakes up.

32:07.648 --> 32:09.051
That's it. Nearly there.

32:11.854 --> 32:12.822
Come in.

32:14.256 --> 32:17.160
Thank you, Luke. If you can just
set them down there for me, please.

32:18.460 --> 32:19.729
Not been born yet?

32:20.362 --> 32:22.565
Can't be too different
from lambing, right?

32:23.432 --> 32:24.634
Get out!

32:28.269 --> 32:30.636
Sorry about that.
They mean well.

32:30.638 --> 32:32.507
Get your hands off me!

32:38.547 --> 32:40.415
Why would you do this?

32:46.721 --> 32:48.090
He's coming.

33:21.656 --> 33:22.891
Give me my baby.

33:24.625 --> 33:25.728
It's a girl.

33:26.761 --> 33:28.330
You said it was a boy.

33:32.334 --> 33:33.736
Give me my baby!

33:41.742 --> 33:43.412
Give me my baby!

34:17.777 --> 34:21.184
You can't do this! Help!

34:27.856 --> 34:29.358
Rachel!

34:33.661 --> 34:34.896
Rachel!

35:19.440 --> 35:22.508
So I asked the good Lord
why He sent us a girl

35:22.510 --> 35:24.644
instead of a boy as He promised.

35:24.646 --> 35:27.414
It's all fine.
It's all part of the plan.

35:27.416 --> 35:29.919
He's wanting to test me.

35:30.952 --> 35:32.822
He's got some sense of humor,
doesn't he?

35:34.389 --> 35:38.860
She's crying for some food, so we best
get cracking with that milk of yours.

35:39.360 --> 35:41.360
A baby needs his mother's milk.

35:41.362 --> 35:42.764
Or her mother's milk.

35:45.599 --> 35:46.800
Bob!

35:46.802 --> 35:49.101
No! Give me my baby!
Bob!

35:49.103 --> 35:50.572
Give me my baby!

35:55.943 --> 35:57.012
Guys.

36:10.391 --> 36:13.928
You... ungrateful whore.

36:15.630 --> 36:18.768
Not only did you burden us
with another girl,

36:19.634 --> 36:21.536
but you attack us
in our own home.

36:23.472 --> 36:24.674
I should've known.

36:26.041 --> 36:29.312
It's typical. It really is.

36:35.483 --> 36:36.619
Please.

36:37.518 --> 36:39.151
Give me my baby.

36:39.153 --> 36:41.757
My... baby!

36:46.827 --> 36:47.896
You are sick.

36:48.963 --> 36:49.864
You're not well.

36:51.632 --> 36:55.538
Please, just let us go.
I am begging you.

36:58.139 --> 36:59.474
Us?

37:01.543 --> 37:03.045
We're the sick ones?

37:05.045 --> 37:06.448
How dare you?

37:08.016 --> 37:09.018
You...

37:10.786 --> 37:16.692
Your world's infected with
pornographic images everywhere.

37:17.858 --> 37:20.730
Men with men.

37:21.563 --> 37:23.599
It's disgusting.

37:25.000 --> 37:30.170
I've seen it. You allow your children
to parade around virtually naked,

37:30.172 --> 37:33.173
worshipping false idols.

37:33.175 --> 37:36.144
You're the sick ones.

37:38.112 --> 37:40.982
We live the way God intended.

37:42.717 --> 37:44.519
We're the light.

37:45.920 --> 37:50.826
You killed Ellie's parents.
Didn't you?

37:53.161 --> 37:55.630
They probably murdered
your parents too.

37:58.632 --> 38:02.001
Please help me. They are liars.

38:02.003 --> 38:04.938
The Bible says, "Do not kill."

38:04.940 --> 38:06.039
David!

38:06.041 --> 38:07.907
Deuteronomy 13.

38:09.077 --> 38:10.242
"If they say

38:10.244 --> 38:12.979
'Let us worship other gods, '

38:12.981 --> 38:15.113
then show them no pity.

38:15.115 --> 38:18.050
Do not spare them
or shield them.

38:18.052 --> 38:21.554
They must certainly be
put to death."

38:21.556 --> 38:24.827
And her name is Faith.

38:25.193 --> 38:29.632
We saved her and our boys
from Satan himself.

38:30.931 --> 38:33.468
Just like Faith all over again,
isn't it, Bob?

38:37.938 --> 38:39.674
Only one place for you.

38:55.556 --> 38:56.558
Help!

39:29.324 --> 39:30.956
Oh, stop it!

39:30.958 --> 39:33.126
For goodness' sake,
it's for the baby.

39:33.128 --> 39:34.697
Don't you care about her?

39:36.597 --> 39:37.766
I need her arms held.

39:54.682 --> 39:55.851
That's it.

41:14.896 --> 41:16.365
Oh...

41:28.876 --> 41:30.776
Ow!

41:46.094 --> 41:47.392
No. No!

41:47.394 --> 41:50.262
No! No!

41:51.699 --> 41:53.199
No!

47:07.648 --> 47:08.951
Hey!

47:11.052 --> 47:12.220
Hello!

47:32.606 --> 47:33.675
Hey!

47:34.409 --> 47:35.610
Hey!

47:37.344 --> 47:38.413
Help!

47:40.648 --> 47:41.983
Hello!

49:42.637 --> 49:43.705
Ellie?

49:45.338 --> 49:47.208
You're Ellie Adams, aren't you?

49:51.512 --> 49:52.747
Thank you for this.

49:57.617 --> 49:59.286
Do you remember what happened?

50:00.320 --> 50:01.690
To you and your parents.

50:02.322 --> 50:04.358
Okay! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

50:09.396 --> 50:10.632
Can you help me?

50:12.766 --> 50:14.335
Help me get away?

50:17.938 --> 50:19.840
They chain you up too,
don't they?

50:24.744 --> 50:27.382
I am so sorry
this has happened to you.

50:29.217 --> 50:31.153
But I can get you out of here.

50:31.918 --> 50:34.954
You just need to try and find
something to break this chain.

50:34.956 --> 50:37.392
Find something
to lever it from the wall.

50:39.260 --> 50:40.695
No, no! Wait! Wait!

50:42.797 --> 50:44.166
Please come back!

50:44.699 --> 50:45.767
Please.

51:37.418 --> 51:40.586
He was running away from the polis
and fell down the hill, so they cuffed him.

51:40.588 --> 51:42.390
Seriously.

51:43.291 --> 51:45.360
He's a dafty, isn't he?

51:47.862 --> 51:49.394
That's some view,
in't it?

51:49.396 --> 51:50.699
Um-hm.

51:52.666 --> 51:54.935
Right. Time for a pick-me-up.

52:01.809 --> 52:03.011
My wee beauty.

52:04.378 --> 52:08.315
Yeah. I need to tell you, Big
Yin, this is your best stuff yet.

52:08.648 --> 52:11.083
Pure, amazing shit. I know
I go on about it all the time,

52:11.085 --> 52:13.719
but I can't help it. I love the way
it makes my mind go the clappers.

52:13.721 --> 52:15.854
Know what I mean? Just like,
100 mile an hour.

52:15.856 --> 52:17.259
It's great.

52:18.326 --> 52:19.661
What did you do that for?

52:21.329 --> 52:22.264
What?

52:23.097 --> 52:24.833
Talking like
it's cocaine or something.

52:25.666 --> 52:26.868
It's weed, mate.

52:27.601 --> 52:29.771
Weed's a downer.
It's not an upper.

52:32.373 --> 52:33.407
And what the...

52:35.509 --> 52:36.677
Where's the rest?

52:37.445 --> 52:38.647
It was good shit.

52:49.789 --> 52:50.992
Seriously, mate?

52:51.992 --> 52:53.495
How are you even conscious?

53:03.637 --> 53:05.606
You're a fucking walloper,
you know that?

53:11.778 --> 53:12.813
Hey!

53:16.784 --> 53:17.919
Do you hear that?

53:29.963 --> 53:33.634
Thank God.
I need your help.

53:34.802 --> 53:38.637
My wife and I, we were taken
at gunpoint by this family.

53:38.639 --> 53:40.938
Whoa, whoa!
That's just close enough, pal.

53:40.940 --> 53:42.740
What the fuck?

53:45.646 --> 53:47.515
I just... I just need
to use your phone.

53:51.085 --> 53:53.755
Guys, there's no time.

53:54.021 --> 53:56.454
My wife is pregnant
and she's in danger.

53:56.456 --> 53:58.692
Whoa! Just keep
your distance, right, pal?

53:58.958 --> 54:00.793
We're not into that kinda shit.

54:00.795 --> 54:02.461
So just jog on, all right?

54:02.463 --> 54:04.662
Look, this is an emergency.

54:04.664 --> 54:07.833
I just need to use your phone.
For a minute, please.

54:07.835 --> 54:09.537
There's no signal up here, pal.

54:09.869 --> 54:12.507
Listen, what you need to do is,

54:12.940 --> 54:15.143
you need to ahead about
three or four mile...

54:16.943 --> 54:18.110
that way.

54:18.112 --> 54:19.981
I don't think you understand.

54:20.614 --> 54:22.713
These people tried to murder me.

54:22.715 --> 54:25.552
They have my wife,
she's in danger.

54:27.554 --> 54:30.121
I just need you to take me
to a nearby village

54:30.123 --> 54:32.624
or at least
just give me some clothes,

54:32.626 --> 54:34.726
so I can find help myself.
Please, anything!

54:34.728 --> 54:36.431
Do you think we're stupid, pal?

54:36.764 --> 54:38.664
You're at it. He's at it.

54:38.666 --> 54:41.503
Jog on. You could be
telling us anything.

55:43.630 --> 55:44.731
Let us go.

55:46.300 --> 55:47.969
Let us go, you psycho!

55:49.869 --> 55:52.806
I've told you,
there's nae signal up here.

55:53.072 --> 55:54.775
There's nothing for miles.

56:03.217 --> 56:06.721
You can't just leave us here.
We've nae water. We'll die.

56:07.588 --> 56:09.090
So, which way?

56:13.726 --> 56:15.661
Don't you understand
your predicament?

56:15.663 --> 56:17.798
I don't get help,
you don't get help.

56:20.000 --> 56:21.766
- There's a road.
- Jase, don't.

56:21.768 --> 56:23.136
Stu, shut up!

56:25.606 --> 56:27.005
There's a road
in that direction.

56:27.007 --> 56:29.777
Just head down the hill.
You'll hit it.

56:30.744 --> 56:32.579
Which way,
when I get to the road?

56:34.782 --> 56:36.050
Head left.

56:46.260 --> 56:48.092
- Grab that.
- Got it.

56:48.094 --> 56:50.195
Cut me free! Cut me free!

56:50.197 --> 56:51.833
He's talking about
the Fairbairns.

56:55.869 --> 56:58.172
Jase, if Bob finds out,
we're both in deep shit.

56:58.739 --> 57:00.706
I know that, you daft bastard.

57:00.708 --> 57:03.278
What choice did I have?
Cut me loose.

57:27.333 --> 57:29.603
You need to do better
than this, young lady.

57:31.271 --> 57:33.740
What use are you
if you can't feed my baby?

57:45.918 --> 57:47.054
Come on, boys.

58:44.945 --> 58:46.014
Enter.

58:54.454 --> 58:55.922
Well, what is it, boys?

58:57.458 --> 58:59.124
We were wondering...

58:59.126 --> 59:01.025
Since she isn't gonna be of use.

59:01.027 --> 59:02.827
Like you said before, Mum.

59:02.829 --> 59:05.429
Yeah, like you said. Before.

59:13.239 --> 59:16.376
So, we were thinking...
Maybe we could...

59:16.943 --> 59:19.012
Because there aren't
any girls around here.

59:19.413 --> 59:22.684
We could, you know... have her.

59:23.751 --> 59:24.819
For us.

59:25.885 --> 59:27.889
What on earth are you
talking about, you silly boys?

59:28.188 --> 59:29.956
For goodness' sake, spit it out.

59:31.824 --> 59:33.794
We thought
we could go with her.

59:34.061 --> 59:36.898
She'd give us a baby boy.
Just like you wanted.

59:37.764 --> 59:39.733
Maybe that was God's plan
all along.

59:43.871 --> 59:45.039
What did you say?

59:46.172 --> 59:48.041
It's what you want, Mother.
We'd be doing this for you.

59:48.541 --> 59:50.844
How could you say such a thing?

59:52.411 --> 59:56.250
No child of mine
will speak such filth!

59:57.451 --> 59:59.387
Not in this house!

01:00:01.221 --> 01:00:02.356
Get out.

01:00:03.456 --> 01:00:04.791
Get out!

01:00:22.041 --> 01:00:22.943
What?

01:00:23.876 --> 01:00:25.746
We shouldn't have said anything.

01:00:26.146 --> 01:00:27.414
We should've just done it.

01:00:29.382 --> 01:00:31.151
What they don't know
won't hurt them.

01:00:33.085 --> 01:00:34.154
Yeah.

01:00:36.056 --> 01:00:37.324
We should do it now.

01:00:38.693 --> 01:00:41.461
Mum and Dad won't keep her around
for much longer after this.

01:01:09.289 --> 01:01:10.391
Stay by the door.

01:01:14.994 --> 01:01:16.163
Get away from me.

01:01:29.876 --> 01:01:31.112
Help me! Help!

01:01:37.885 --> 01:01:39.316
- Get her legs.
- Help me!

01:01:44.324 --> 01:01:45.927
I was gonna be gentle.

01:01:48.128 --> 01:01:49.197
Not anymore.

01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:54.368
Help!

01:01:56.269 --> 01:01:58.139
Help! Help...

01:02:00.039 --> 01:02:01.007
Luke.

01:02:02.509 --> 01:02:04.344
I even dressed
for the occasion.

01:02:26.666 --> 01:02:28.101
Jesus.

01:02:29.068 --> 01:02:30.337
I thought you were dead.

01:02:34.574 --> 01:02:35.876
A girl.

01:02:37.277 --> 01:02:39.012
They have her in the house.

01:02:45.585 --> 01:02:47.954
Stay back. Careful.

01:02:54.695 --> 01:02:56.463
Can't believe
they would speak to that.

01:03:01.001 --> 01:03:04.939
For the love of God,
keep the door shut!

01:03:14.414 --> 01:03:15.981
Bob, what is that?

01:03:15.983 --> 01:03:17.051
I don't know.

01:03:22.155 --> 01:03:23.391
Go check the shed.

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:28.994
What in God's name?

01:03:28.996 --> 01:03:30.597
Go check the shed now.

01:03:41.041 --> 01:03:43.311
No. We can't leave
without our baby.

01:03:44.378 --> 01:03:45.776
We have no choice.

01:03:45.778 --> 01:03:47.679
No, I can't leave her.

01:03:47.681 --> 01:03:49.546
They have guns, Rachel.

01:03:49.548 --> 01:03:51.418
We're no good to her dead.
Look at me.

01:03:51.717 --> 01:03:54.020
We need to get away
and get help.

01:03:54.286 --> 01:03:57.157
It's her best chance.
Our best chance. Okay?

01:04:29.722 --> 01:04:31.157
Run.

01:04:39.231 --> 01:04:41.034
No!

01:08:44.778 --> 01:08:46.247

I'll even make fresh mint sauce.

01:09:45.404 --> 01:09:48.774
What are you doing?

01:09:49.442 --> 01:09:51.545

Agnes.

01:10:04.524 --> 01:10:06.660
I need to get something
to keep his head up.

01:10:07.493 --> 01:10:10.063
Agnes, love, they're dead.

01:10:11.663 --> 01:10:12.832
They're dead.

01:10:13.899 --> 01:10:17.501
We need to bury them.
They're starting to smell.

01:10:17.503 --> 01:10:20.006
How... dare you?

01:10:22.141 --> 01:10:23.943
These are my boys.

01:10:24.711 --> 01:10:27.548
Get out! Get out!

01:10:27.881 --> 01:10:30.748
Agnes, love, I'm sorry.

01:10:32.851 --> 01:10:34.421
We need to hand them over.

01:10:35.421 --> 01:10:37.155
We can't keep Him
waiting any longer.

01:11:03.817 --> 01:11:06.720
How could He take
such good boys?

01:11:07.487 --> 01:11:11.391
I cannot find
His teachings in this.

01:11:14.527 --> 01:11:16.596
They're in a better place now,
my love.

01:11:19.032 --> 01:11:22.436
I bet you they're up there
right now, looking down on us.

01:11:23.069 --> 01:11:25.937
Stood next to the Lord.
Arm in arm.

01:11:25.939 --> 01:11:27.074
No.

01:11:28.173 --> 01:11:30.511
He should not have done this.

01:11:31.743 --> 01:11:35.648
He made a mistake.
This isn't right.

01:11:37.484 --> 01:11:39.686
They were good boys.

01:11:46.091 --> 01:11:47.994
Come on. Let's go.

01:11:51.064 --> 01:11:53.534
You go back if you want,
I'm staying here.

01:12:02.108 --> 01:12:05.078
Agnes, it's time to go.

01:12:08.247 --> 01:12:09.817
It's been hours.

01:12:10.149 --> 01:12:11.915
We need to get back to the baby.

01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:16.189
And so it begins.

01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:19.726
It was the same
when Faith arrived.

01:12:25.832 --> 01:12:29.136
Agnes, I love you.

01:12:31.037 --> 01:12:33.006
No one will ever replace you.

01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:38.045
You're my girl.
And you always will be.

01:12:40.579 --> 01:12:43.680
Come on. Let's go.
I'll make you a cup of tea.

01:12:43.682 --> 01:12:46.185
I want to be
on my own with them.

01:12:47.153 --> 01:12:48.622
I'll walk home.

01:12:50.088 --> 01:12:51.821
We need to feed the baby.

01:12:51.823 --> 01:12:53.059
You feed her!

01:12:57.829 --> 01:13:00.934
And if she has no more milk,
I want her gone.

01:13:01.935 --> 01:13:03.170
Do you hear me?

01:13:41.807 --> 01:13:42.743
Come on.

01:13:43.376 --> 01:13:44.845
Come on.

01:13:59.759 --> 01:14:00.894
There.

01:14:03.962 --> 01:14:06.233
Okay. Okay.

01:14:19.011 --> 01:14:20.079
Okay.

01:15:02.788 --> 01:15:04.023
Ellie, wait.

01:15:39.958 --> 01:15:42.194
Oh... Hello, my baby.

01:15:43.829 --> 01:15:45.364
I am so sorry.

01:15:51.770 --> 01:15:53.172
It's all right.

01:16:34.113 --> 01:16:35.115
Hush, now.

01:17:11.050 --> 01:17:12.284
Where are you?

01:17:14.854 --> 01:17:16.387
You won't get far!

01:17:46.953 --> 01:17:48.255
What are you up to?

01:17:52.190 --> 01:17:54.258
Please don't hurt me or my baby.

01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:55.561
I'll do as I'm told now.

01:17:58.197 --> 01:17:59.431
Bob, please.

01:18:00.099 --> 01:18:01.498
I know you don't want
to hurt me.

01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:03.403
I could've run away,
but I didn't.

01:18:04.636 --> 01:18:06.907
I'll provide milk
and I won't be any trouble.

01:18:07.372 --> 01:18:11.110
If Agnes sees you up here,
all hell will break loose.

01:18:12.043 --> 01:18:13.913
She doesn't want you
near the baby.

01:18:14.412 --> 01:18:15.581
I understand.

01:18:21.186 --> 01:18:22.288
Okay.

01:18:28.159 --> 01:18:29.461
Walk straight out the room,

01:18:30.896 --> 01:18:32.465
put the baby back in the cot.

01:18:34.466 --> 01:18:36.402
And get you back down
to the shed.

01:19:10.536 --> 01:19:11.872
Don't look, okay?

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:22.948
No!

01:19:29.956 --> 01:19:31.056
Oh, my God.

01:19:31.524 --> 01:19:32.592
Oh, my God.

01:19:40.432 --> 01:19:41.501
<i>Police.</i>

01:19:43.703 --> 01:19:45.669
<i>We need help urgently.</i>

01:19:45.671 --> 01:19:48.074
<i>We've been kidnapped.
Held hostage.</i>

01:19:49.108 --> 01:19:50.911
<i>My husband has been murdered.</i>

01:19:51.609 --> 01:19:54.280
<i>We found the missing girl,
Ellie Adams.</i>

01:19:54.579 --> 01:19:57.650
<i>They have guns. Please,
we need help immediately.</i>

01:20:01.052 --> 01:20:02.322
<i>Rachel Hopkins.</i>

01:20:03.421 --> 01:20:04.623
We were driving from...

01:20:06.257 --> 01:20:08.224
Oh, my God. I don't remember.

01:20:08.226 --> 01:20:10.697
Um... Can you trace the phone?

01:20:11.764 --> 01:20:14.000
Fairbairn Farm.
That's the name of the farm.

01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:17.304
Um... Okay.
Tell me what else I can do.

01:20:21.239 --> 01:20:22.509
Five kilometers?

01:20:26.712 --> 01:20:28.214
Oh, my God, she's here.

01:20:31.449 --> 01:20:32.652
She has a gun.

01:20:36.454 --> 01:20:37.390
Hello?

01:20:42.661 --> 01:20:43.997
Shit.

01:21:50.662 --> 01:21:52.531
No... Come on.

01:22:03.775 --> 01:22:06.645
Ellie, listen to me carefully.

01:22:07.279 --> 01:22:11.451
If I get hurt, you take her
and you run to the road, okay?

01:22:11.684 --> 01:22:13.353
As fast as you can.

01:22:13.685 --> 01:22:16.422
You keep running
until you find help.

01:22:39.411 --> 01:22:41.514
That's my baby.

01:23:11.877 --> 01:23:14.247
Ellie, run! Now!

01:23:14.813 --> 01:23:16.716
No! Get away from her!

01:24:19.244 --> 01:24:21.613
Rachel. Rachel Hopkins.

01:24:22.314 --> 01:24:23.750
Can you tell me what's happened?

01:24:28.621 --> 01:24:29.855
I was shot.

01:24:30.922 --> 01:24:32.488
Who shot you?

01:24:32.490 --> 01:24:33.693
A woman.

01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:36.460
Agnes Fairbairn.

01:24:36.462 --> 01:24:37.530
Where is she now?

01:24:38.497 --> 01:24:39.830
She's dead.

01:24:39.832 --> 01:24:41.834
Hi, there.
Can you tell me your name?

01:24:43.301 --> 01:24:44.401
Rachel.

01:24:44.403 --> 01:24:45.572
And who's this?

01:24:48.474 --> 01:24:50.243
She doesn't have a name yet.

01:24:50.609 --> 01:24:52.278
Can you tell me what happened?

01:24:52.711 --> 01:24:55.347
Rachel, we need to have a look
at the baby. Is that okay?

01:25:50.802 --> 01:25:53.506
Suspect is down
and not moving. Move in.

01:25:53.872 --> 01:25:57.543
Okay. It's all over.
It's all over.

01:25:58.344 --> 01:26:00.846
Let's get you onto a stretcher
now and get you to the hospital.

01:26:10.823 --> 01:26:11.724
Rachel.

01:26:13.926 --> 01:26:16.629
Ellie Adams.
Can you tell us where she is?

01:26:17.829 --> 01:26:18.831
She's right here.

01:26:39.417 --> 01:26:42.085
<i>The girl in the woods,
did you see her?</i>

01:26:42.087 --> 01:26:43.456
<i>No.</i>

01:26:55.100 --> 01:26:56.933
<i>She not joining us for dinner?</i>

01:26:56.935 --> 01:26:59.472
<i>She might.
If we're lucky.</i>

01:27:03.876 --> 01:27:06.012
Don't worry, Rachel.
We'll find her.

01:27:08.514 --> 01:27:12.351
<i>"And a woman who held
a babe against her bosom said,</i>

01:27:12.885 --> 01:27:15.485
<i>'Speak to us of Children.'</i>

01:27:15.487 --> 01:27:20.490
<i>And he said: Your children
are not your children.</i>

01:27:20.492 --> 01:27:24.797
<i>They are the sons and daughters
of Life's longing for itself.</i>

01:27:25.631 --> 01:27:28.434
<i>They come through you
but not from you.</i>

01:27:29.435 --> 01:27:33.539
<i>And though they are with you,
yet they belong not to you.</i>

01:27:35.039 --> 01:27:38.144
<i>You may give them your love
but not your thoughts,</i>

01:27:39.011 --> 01:27:41.447
<i>for they have
their own thoughts.</i>

01:27:42.213 --> 01:27:45.952
<i>You may house their bodies
but not their souls,</i>

01:27:46.918 --> 01:27:50.155
<i>for their souls dwell
in the house of tomorrow,</i>

01:27:50.756 --> 01:27:52.125
<i>which you cannot visit,</i>

01:27:52.990 --> 01:27:55.161
<i>not even in your dreams.</i>

01:27:56.528 --> 01:27:58.564
<i>You may strive to be like them,</i>

01:27:59.131 --> 01:28:01.734
<i>but seek not
to make them like you.</i>

01:28:02.167 --> 01:28:06.572
<i>For life goes not backwards
nor tarries with yesterday.</i>

01:28:07.872 --> 01:28:13.044
<i>You are the bows from which your
children as living arrows are sent forth.</i>

01:28:14.011 --> 01:28:17.549
<i>The archer sees the mark
upon the path of the infinite,</i>

01:28:18.550 --> 01:28:20.683
<i>and He bends you with His might</i>

01:28:20.685 --> 01:28:23.655
<i>that His arrows
may go swift and far.</i>

01:28:24.689 --> 01:28:28.027
<i>Let your bending in the
archer's hand be for gladness.</i>

01:28:28.993 --> 01:28:31.730
<i>For even as He loves
the arrow that flies,</i>

01:28:33.231 --> 01:28:36.836
<i>so He loves also
the bow that is stable."</i>
