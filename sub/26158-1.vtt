WEBVTT

03:02.001 --> 03:04.456
Oh please, this is a
huge misunderstanding.

03:04.751 --> 03:07.581
I'm a college student on
an environmental study.

03:07.876 --> 03:08.875
My parents...

03:10.335 --> 03:11.449
Please just call them.

03:13.210 --> 03:16.040
Would you please
try to stay in one piece?

03:16.335 --> 03:17.533
Can I have my passport back?

03:17.751 --> 03:19.456
You should cut this chick loose.

03:19.751 --> 03:21.430
She'll never last a sentence in this Coop.

03:21.709 --> 03:23.388
Yeah, how did she
even survive the hatch?

03:23.501 --> 03:24.615
Have you been to court?

03:24.918 --> 03:25.531
Get a load of this.

03:25.834 --> 03:26.993
I didn't go to court.

03:27.293 --> 03:29.827
This is a huge misunderstanding.

03:30.126 --> 03:31.285
There was no trial.

03:32.418 --> 03:33.122
There never is, honey.

03:33.418 --> 03:34.747
Never is.

03:35.043 --> 03:36.702
Would you three just walk?!

03:37.959 --> 03:40.823
I get enough exercise pushing my luck.

03:41.126 --> 03:42.125
Move!

05:46.376 --> 05:47.375
Well,

05:48.084 --> 05:49.163
it's a new day

05:50.542 --> 05:52.452
with a new way to serve.

05:52.751 --> 05:54.230
But it's for the greater good, right?

05:58.418 --> 05:59.781
All right, then.

06:00.084 --> 06:01.913
The Republic of rattica.

06:02.210 --> 06:02.914
Never heard of it.

06:03.210 --> 06:04.848
The brats at the Pentagon know about it

06:04.918 --> 06:06.282
and so will you.

06:06.584 --> 06:08.823
All the intel has been
fed into your compy wrist.

06:12.626 --> 06:14.956
It's an island off of south America

06:15.251 --> 06:18.535
where every scumbag on
the planet goes to hide.

06:18.834 --> 06:21.789
Rattica is a major player
in the olvidados drug cartel

06:22.084 --> 06:25.369
who seem oblivious or
unwilling to negotiate

06:25.667 --> 06:27.281
the untapped oil reserve on the island.

06:27.584 --> 06:30.664
Ruled by nefarious
dictator general Franco,

06:30.959 --> 06:32.572
rattica has been the launching pad

06:32.876 --> 06:36.081
for syndicate drug smuggler
operations for over a decade.

06:37.834 --> 06:39.323
Before I took command,

06:39.626 --> 06:41.081
agent five was sent out to negotiate

06:41.376 --> 06:42.989
an embassy deal with the general.

06:43.293 --> 06:45.202
That is until this individual,

06:47.043 --> 06:51.032
American born pot smuggler Jett Bryant,

06:51.335 --> 06:53.198
apparently lead a successful coup.

06:54.709 --> 06:57.198
Despite the absence of a free election,

06:57.501 --> 07:01.116
he now goes by the title of El presidente.

07:01.418 --> 07:03.997
That really pisses us off.

07:04.293 --> 07:05.292
Always does.

07:05.584 --> 07:07.948
We've lost all contact with agent five.

07:08.251 --> 07:10.080
President, Mr. Bryant,

07:10.376 --> 07:13.490
is now aided by infamous
third-world interrogator

07:13.792 --> 07:14.826
inga Von krupp,

07:15.126 --> 07:18.160
who currently oversees
the islands penal system.

07:18.460 --> 07:21.119
The cartel is aware of
our ks-13 activities,

07:21.418 --> 07:23.701
so they've enlisted krupp's skills

07:24.001 --> 07:25.864
to round up all potential resistance

07:26.168 --> 07:29.407
and commit unspeakable
human rights violations.

07:29.709 --> 07:31.698
We care about human rights now?

07:32.001 --> 07:33.160
Listen to me!

07:33.460 --> 07:35.573
This wardress is a sadist!

07:35.876 --> 07:37.160
Triads,

07:37.460 --> 07:39.039
commies,

07:39.335 --> 07:40.334
hired keepers,

07:40.584 --> 07:42.369
panada poachers,

07:42.667 --> 07:44.281
banana Republic fascists.

07:45.667 --> 07:48.077
It makes no difference to this monster.

07:48.376 --> 07:50.534
Go in quiet, eliminate the target,

07:50.834 --> 07:52.198
disrupt the stability.

07:52.501 --> 07:53.535
I got it.

07:53.834 --> 07:55.323
She isn't even motivated by money.

07:55.626 --> 07:56.625
Von krupp?

07:58.335 --> 08:00.013
I've busted out of
more jungle hell holes

08:00.210 --> 08:02.744
than she's licked in her
entire miserable life.

08:03.709 --> 08:07.073
I've been electrocuted, spat on,

08:07.376 --> 08:08.989
made to crawl like an animal.

08:12.501 --> 08:13.500
Damn, I miss it.

08:15.043 --> 08:17.123
You be careful out there.

08:42.460 --> 08:43.948
Back so soon, Jade?

08:44.251 --> 08:46.331
I was in need of a spa vacation.

08:46.626 --> 08:48.910
She killed another John at the pier.

08:49.210 --> 08:50.948
Jade, Jade, Jade.

08:51.251 --> 08:53.409
Maybe you should let the
clients take you for a change.

08:54.460 --> 08:55.499
Where's the fun in that?

08:55.792 --> 08:58.202
Besides, I look good covered in red.

08:58.501 --> 08:59.910
I think you prefer stripes.

09:04.709 --> 09:07.039
Oh, you're a real "perv-o the clown"

09:07.335 --> 09:09.119
handing out these little cocktail napkins.

09:09.418 --> 09:10.727
Wearing a circus tent
ain't gonna protected

09:10.751 --> 09:12.865
the critters and the rats, sugar.

09:13.168 --> 09:14.766
I'm looking at the biggest rat in here

09:14.792 --> 09:16.781
and you better know
where to keep your paws.

09:18.501 --> 09:20.220
It ain't the paws you
need to worry about.

09:20.335 --> 09:21.539
It's the teeth.

09:37.542 --> 09:38.541
Guess he had a friend.

09:46.460 --> 09:47.664
Don't you wanna roach too?

09:49.460 --> 09:51.869
Don't worry, ladies, it
only gets worse from here.

09:53.043 --> 09:54.042
Take them to cell block f

09:54.251 --> 09:56.534
and tell wardress krupp we
have the catch of the day.

10:07.834 --> 10:08.493
Dang.

10:08.792 --> 10:10.781
I've been here over a goddamn week.

10:11.084 --> 10:12.962
When they gonna load my
bird with wacky tobaccy?

10:13.084 --> 10:15.448
They're coming to
meet you today, Holmes.

10:15.751 --> 10:16.750
Good.

10:16.918 --> 10:18.827
I mean, I appreciate
the hospitality and all.

10:19.126 --> 10:21.240
You could slip on this
banana peal all you like.

10:21.542 --> 10:23.576
I prefer to get paid and slide.

10:28.210 --> 10:29.449
Good morning, gentlemen.

10:30.792 --> 10:32.452
Where's Franco?

10:32.751 --> 10:34.240
I am wardress Von krupp.

10:34.542 --> 10:35.701
And the little fella?

10:36.001 --> 10:38.160
My loyal assistant, gordo.

10:38.460 --> 10:40.073
Just dandy, you make a lovely couple.

10:40.376 --> 10:41.375
Where's Franco?

10:41.667 --> 10:44.906
The general has met a
rather unfortunate demise.

10:45.210 --> 10:46.209
I'm outta here.

10:46.501 --> 10:47.500
Remain seated.

10:49.959 --> 10:54.289
The Republic has been infiltrated
by operatives of ks-13.

10:54.584 --> 10:55.289
Who, what, where?

10:55.584 --> 10:56.743
I don't give a shit, lady.

11:00.792 --> 11:02.497
"Until the cartel is satisfied

11:02.792 --> 11:05.406
"that all foreign spies
have been apprehended,

11:05.709 --> 11:10.495
"Jett Bryant is hereby the
defacto president of rattica."

11:10.792 --> 11:12.452
Oh, that's rich.

11:12.751 --> 11:15.035
"Upon the conclusion
of wardress Von krupp's

11:15.335 --> 11:17.618
"investigation of potential
foreign terrorists

11:17.918 --> 11:20.032
"and domestic revolutionaries,

11:20.335 --> 11:22.698
"Mr. Bryant will be
relieved from his position

11:23.001 --> 11:25.990
"and allowed to return
to his native country."

11:26.293 --> 11:27.372
Let me get this straight,

11:27.667 --> 11:29.452
we want me to be a pawn in your covert war

11:29.751 --> 11:31.160
against the United States?

11:31.460 --> 11:32.073
No way, momma.

11:32.376 --> 11:35.035
Sorry, puppeteers, I gotta
take scissors to this act.

11:35.335 --> 11:38.324
"If Mr. Bryant accepts this position,

11:39.418 --> 11:41.156
"he will be exonerated for the loss

11:41.460 --> 11:44.869
"of the 200 kilo shipment
confiscated by the coast guard."

11:45.168 --> 11:47.202
They told me little
shrimp boat off tybee.

11:47.501 --> 11:49.831
Not shrimp boat off little tybee.

11:50.126 --> 11:51.125
Two islands.

11:51.210 --> 11:53.290
Two different fucking islands.

11:53.584 --> 11:54.164
Not my fault.

11:54.460 --> 11:57.164
"For his loyalty, the olvidados family

11:57.460 --> 11:59.618
"will pay 100 thousand dollars."

11:59.918 --> 12:01.756
Throw as many frogs in
that sack as you want.

12:02.043 --> 12:03.656
It ain't gonna make me jump any higher.

12:03.959 --> 12:05.368
Now if you'll excuse me.

12:05.667 --> 12:07.872
"If he refuses,

12:08.168 --> 12:09.702
"execute him."

12:10.001 --> 12:11.000
Ouch.

12:11.084 --> 12:12.762
Coulda just started with the fine print.

12:12.959 --> 12:14.697
How long's this gonna take?

12:15.001 --> 12:16.580
To expedite this urgent matter,

12:16.876 --> 12:19.160
I have enlisted the help
of my former colleague,

12:19.460 --> 12:20.459
Dr. greeley.

12:20.667 --> 12:23.701
A pleasure to work along
side you again, inga.

12:24.001 --> 12:26.331
We shall implement our
skills perfected together

12:26.626 --> 12:28.615
in the great voodoo rebellion.

12:28.918 --> 12:31.622
Since those sovereign
and complicated times,

12:31.918 --> 12:34.077
I've acquired many new methods.

12:35.084 --> 12:37.243
I'm dying to reveal them.

12:37.542 --> 12:39.077
As have I, doctor.

12:39.376 --> 12:39.909
Joy.

12:40.210 --> 12:41.744
The first act had me amused,

12:42.043 --> 12:45.157
this third wheel with
the parka, he's creepy.

12:45.460 --> 12:48.324
Seriously, motherfucker,
I don't like you at all!

12:48.626 --> 12:50.411
So what the hell am I supposed to do?

12:50.709 --> 12:52.538
Sign bills, cut ribbons?

12:52.834 --> 12:53.833
Nothing.

12:59.751 --> 13:01.580
By the balls.

13:01.876 --> 13:02.910
Then I'll make trouble.

13:11.210 --> 13:14.539
Girl, you gotta get it
together if you're gonna survive.

13:14.834 --> 13:16.313
Look, we got off on the wrong foot.

13:16.584 --> 13:18.063
Let's carve out a corner in the stump

13:18.293 --> 13:19.781
and we'll watch our own backs.

13:20.084 --> 13:22.242
Yeah, you have anyone on
the outside looking for you?

13:22.335 --> 13:23.414
A man?

13:23.709 --> 13:25.948
My parents don't even know I'm here.

13:26.251 --> 13:27.849
I told them I didn't want to go to Paris

13:27.959 --> 13:29.993
and my senior class volunteered

13:30.293 --> 13:32.827
to save the turtles over spring break

13:33.126 --> 13:34.705
and [ Missed the boat home.

13:35.001 --> 13:36.000
The turtles?

13:36.210 --> 13:38.415
It's just terrible what they...

13:38.709 --> 13:39.914
Don't you see?

13:40.210 --> 13:41.994
She cares about the turtles.

13:42.293 --> 13:43.656
[ Like them too.

13:43.959 --> 13:44.572
In a stew!

13:44.876 --> 13:45.410
Leave her alone!

13:45.709 --> 13:47.448
She's just a young girl.

13:47.751 --> 13:49.081
We'll carve into your shell.

13:49.376 --> 13:52.660
Right into the nice pink meat.

13:52.959 --> 13:54.243
Charli and Nicky!

13:54.542 --> 13:55.661
Give us some breathing room.

13:55.876 --> 13:58.160
I smell fresh fish in the market.

14:08.418 --> 14:09.531
What do they call you?

14:11.043 --> 14:12.042
Penny.

14:12.959 --> 14:15.868
Your momma didn't think you
were worth very much, did she?

14:17.293 --> 14:18.327
It's a family name.

14:21.084 --> 14:22.368
Well, penny,

14:23.418 --> 14:26.282
it's hard to get change for a "penny,"

14:27.751 --> 14:28.956
but I'll break you.

14:30.126 --> 14:31.830
Oh yes I will.

14:33.501 --> 14:34.500
Who are you?

14:35.460 --> 14:37.323
I'm val, penny,

14:37.626 --> 14:39.615
and a gal like me has grown accustomed

14:39.918 --> 14:42.202
to the finer things in life.

14:43.751 --> 14:44.750
Please, please.

14:45.876 --> 14:47.456
Please, stop, please.

14:48.626 --> 14:53.082
There used to be a time when
we could get soap, shampoo

14:53.376 --> 14:55.910
and even nylon stockings for a nickel.

14:56.918 --> 15:00.702
But once and awhile a
bargain presents itself

15:01.001 --> 15:04.660
and it just so happens,
today, I found a sale.

15:04.959 --> 15:06.538
A tissue for a penny.

15:06.834 --> 15:08.233
No! No!

15:08.376 --> 15:09.375
No, please!

15:10.418 --> 15:11.417
Clean it, bitch!

15:11.667 --> 15:12.951
Stop!

15:13.251 --> 15:15.580
Clean my ass or kiss theirs goodbye.

15:17.626 --> 15:18.865
That's right, wipe!

15:19.168 --> 15:21.282
Wipe, flatten that tongue!

15:21.584 --> 15:24.539
Yeah, get it all clean.

15:24.834 --> 15:26.697
Get right in there.

15:27.001 --> 15:27.534
Deeper!

15:27.834 --> 15:29.414
I want clean insides.

15:30.709 --> 15:32.823
Yeah, yeah, you're good.

15:33.876 --> 15:35.535
Oh yeah, you're really good.

15:36.542 --> 15:39.327
I'll be remembering this
when it's period time.

15:46.210 --> 15:47.664
You see, penny,

15:47.959 --> 15:49.448
life in here is cheap.

15:59.084 --> 16:00.368
I wish I had a taco.

16:02.335 --> 16:03.334
You like tacos, man?

16:03.418 --> 16:04.826
Never heard of a taco.

16:06.460 --> 16:08.164
Damn, what is this country's problem?

16:08.460 --> 16:09.789
This place is miserable.

16:11.460 --> 16:14.494
What am I supposed to do while
those freaks figure it out?

16:14.792 --> 16:15.791
Really, Holmes?

16:17.001 --> 16:19.456
There are cells packed with women,

16:19.751 --> 16:21.614
women loose in the britches,

16:21.918 --> 16:24.032
and you ask me this question?

16:24.335 --> 16:26.573
Ask a traumatized inmate for a date?

16:26.876 --> 16:27.875
No thank you.

16:28.126 --> 16:29.125
Just take 'em.

16:29.376 --> 16:31.864
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Chester the molester,

16:32.168 --> 16:34.327
I ain't El presidente of the rape squad.

16:34.626 --> 16:36.660
They are so lonely.

16:36.959 --> 16:37.958
They want it.

16:39.293 --> 16:40.827
Man, I like chicks that are into me.

16:41.126 --> 16:43.080
I don't do that power play horseshit.

16:43.376 --> 16:44.375
Me neither.

16:45.251 --> 16:47.580
I have a wife and eight children.

16:47.876 --> 16:49.739
Why's your ass always in that chair?

16:50.918 --> 16:51.917
Eight children.

16:53.210 --> 16:54.449
Is your wife hot?

16:54.751 --> 16:57.491
Like a load of bread
stuffed in a sandal.

16:59.792 --> 17:01.655
I knew general Franco.

17:01.959 --> 17:03.368
How many generals have you known?

17:04.959 --> 17:06.118
Since the revolution?

17:07.126 --> 17:08.125
Ten.

17:08.168 --> 17:09.997
When was the revolution?

17:10.293 --> 17:10.872
Last year.

17:11.168 --> 17:12.872
Last year?

17:13.168 --> 17:13.826
Si.

17:14.126 --> 17:15.125
Fuck!

17:15.876 --> 17:16.910
The road to freedom

17:17.210 --> 17:19.619
is always under construction in rattica.

17:21.335 --> 17:22.994
They're gonna kill you too, Holmes.

17:23.293 --> 17:25.247
Stupid world.

17:25.542 --> 17:28.531
When did it become okay to
bogart the goddamn joint?!

18:48.709 --> 18:49.708
Hello?

18:51.418 --> 18:52.417
Not another one.

18:52.709 --> 18:53.708
Maybe she'll go away.

18:55.709 --> 18:56.914
I'm looking for someone.

18:57.210 --> 18:59.119
They just keep coming here.

18:59.418 --> 19:01.656
An American, like me.

19:01.959 --> 19:03.198
It just never ends.

19:03.501 --> 19:04.865
You canaries can start squawking

19:05.168 --> 19:06.531
or we can do this the hard way!

19:08.376 --> 19:11.285
Senorita, we don't want no trouble.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.223
You wanna know if we've seen Americans?

19:13.251 --> 19:13.784
When don't we see them?

19:14.084 --> 19:15.083
Every damn week.

19:15.126 --> 19:16.352
From the sky and the sea.

19:16.376 --> 19:16.909
At the butcher.

19:17.210 --> 19:17.743
The baker.

19:18.043 --> 19:19.622
Washing up on the shores at dawn.

19:19.918 --> 19:21.656
Parachuting into the
sugar fields at night.

19:21.959 --> 19:23.572
Wednesdays at the bowling alley.

19:23.876 --> 19:25.227
We can't even go to the damn movies

19:25.251 --> 19:26.739
without seeing a fucking American.

19:27.959 --> 19:28.958
Wrong answer.

22:09.084 --> 22:11.993
Do you have a listening problem?

22:12.293 --> 22:13.622
I'm sending you the coordinates.

22:13.918 --> 22:14.917
Be there!

22:27.293 --> 22:28.292
Why would she do that?

22:28.460 --> 22:30.289
I've done nothing to her.

22:30.584 --> 22:32.538
Some people are just born mean

22:32.834 --> 22:34.697
and her inner demons ass fuck.

22:35.001 --> 22:37.160
She's been here as
long as I can remember.

22:37.460 --> 22:39.218
The only person who
truly deserves this hell.

22:39.376 --> 22:41.114
I think she likes it.

22:41.418 --> 22:42.576
All right, hit the showers!

22:42.792 --> 22:44.655
Time to scrub the fleas from the trees.

22:45.751 --> 22:47.956
I was thinking we could
spend a spell with you.

22:48.251 --> 22:50.209
You don't have to scrap
the pan to get this pie.

22:50.376 --> 22:51.534
I don't want your a hostage

22:51.834 --> 22:53.198
and you ain't sneaking my keys.

22:53.501 --> 22:54.035
We wouldn't do that.

22:54.335 --> 22:55.823
Yeah, we just wanna have some fun.

22:56.126 --> 22:57.125
Don't even bother.

22:57.168 --> 22:58.287
I've been married three time

22:58.542 --> 23:00.101
and each of them were nastier than you.

23:00.293 --> 23:01.292
We ain't nasty.

23:01.460 --> 23:02.573
Unless you want us to be.

23:03.542 --> 23:06.997
They was so crocodile mean,
I took an ax to my cock.

23:07.293 --> 23:08.292
Timber!

23:09.792 --> 23:10.871
Jesus.

23:11.168 --> 23:13.122
Solved all my problems at once.

23:13.418 --> 23:14.497
I ain't got no log for you.

23:14.751 --> 23:17.365
So you rabid beavers, go
build a dike in the shower.

23:17.667 --> 23:18.666
Get moving!

23:19.834 --> 23:21.572
Please, call the state department.

23:21.876 --> 23:23.240
Tell them penny lupino is here.

23:23.542 --> 23:25.656
Please, my parents have money.

23:25.959 --> 23:26.493
Money, you say?

23:26.792 --> 23:28.269
Yes, they'll give you whatever you want.

23:28.293 --> 23:29.872
Please, just call.

23:30.168 --> 23:31.167
We'll see.

24:00.460 --> 24:01.664
What the fuck?

24:02.918 --> 24:03.997
What the fuck, man?

24:04.293 --> 24:04.997
Come on!

24:05.293 --> 24:06.372
Did you do this?

24:07.501 --> 24:08.660
All one big setup, huh?

24:08.959 --> 24:10.993
I'm just making it official.

24:11.293 --> 24:13.407
I don't want them coming after me, Holmes.

24:13.709 --> 24:14.823
I got a family.

24:15.834 --> 24:17.538
Fuck, I hate this place!

24:17.834 --> 24:19.289
That was my lucky shirt too.

24:19.584 --> 24:20.663
No it wasn't.

24:20.959 --> 24:24.039
You're the unluckiest person I ever met.

24:24.335 --> 24:26.914
I wouldn't want to be
in your shoes, Holmes.

24:27.210 --> 24:29.324
These shoes don't even fucking fit!

24:29.626 --> 24:30.625
They don't fit, man!

24:31.667 --> 24:32.746
Horse shit!

24:33.043 --> 24:34.042
Rats,

24:34.876 --> 24:35.875
roaches!

24:36.168 --> 24:38.531
Where's the goddamn booze?!

24:38.834 --> 24:39.833
More roaches.

24:43.251 --> 24:44.490
Franco?

24:44.792 --> 24:46.247
They told me you was dead, buddy.

24:47.667 --> 24:48.872
Since you're a live and all,

24:49.168 --> 24:50.167
I need to get.

24:50.918 --> 24:51.917
Fuck, Jesus!

24:52.959 --> 24:54.368
What'd y'all do to him?

24:54.667 --> 24:58.077
Exotic plants and the
crushed spin of a barracuda.

24:58.376 --> 25:01.739
While paralyzed, he saw
himself buried alive.

25:02.043 --> 25:04.656
Now he believes he is the living dead.

25:04.959 --> 25:07.698
Small price to pay for
treason against the cartel.

25:08.709 --> 25:10.914
I prefer kava kava with swordfish spine.

25:12.293 --> 25:13.498
Sometimes you have to work

25:13.792 --> 25:16.076
with the materials at your disposal.

25:16.376 --> 25:17.375
Why, my dear,

25:17.626 --> 25:19.706
a simple phone call to the doctor

25:20.001 --> 25:22.160
and you coulda received excellent results.

25:23.501 --> 25:25.785
Your subject would've
been more productive too.

25:27.667 --> 25:30.747
One should always strive for perfection.

25:31.043 --> 25:32.042
Perhaps.

25:35.001 --> 25:37.785
Where did your reluctant
leader run off to?

25:38.084 --> 25:39.663
He probably lost his appetite.

25:39.959 --> 25:41.198
Speaking of appetite,

25:41.501 --> 25:42.580
I'm ravished

25:42.876 --> 25:45.240
and I can't wait to
tell you in great depth

25:45.542 --> 25:47.781
about all my important discoveries.

25:48.084 --> 25:49.163
Over lunch?

25:49.460 --> 25:50.459
Shall we?

25:51.251 --> 25:53.830
I have prepared something special.

25:54.126 --> 25:56.035
Hopefully you will like it.

25:56.335 --> 25:57.698
Probably not.

26:02.376 --> 26:03.614
We have to bust out of here.

26:03.918 --> 26:04.952
A big bust out.

26:05.251 --> 26:06.370
Do we bring penny with us?

26:06.584 --> 26:08.119
I don't think she can make it.

26:08.418 --> 26:10.227
If we get her out, she
can stay with the rebellion.

26:10.251 --> 26:12.329
Won't her rich parents
come looking for her anyway?

26:12.501 --> 26:14.180
If that guard can't
stick his pecker out,

26:14.335 --> 26:16.244
he ain't gonna stick is neck out for her.

26:16.542 --> 26:18.860
If we can get her out she might
bring the attention we need

26:18.918 --> 26:20.282
to finance the revolution.

26:21.335 --> 26:23.173
High profile
American parents and all,

26:23.293 --> 26:24.906
that could work.

26:25.210 --> 26:27.539
We've gotta protect her
until we figure out a plan.

26:49.168 --> 26:50.531
Penny for your thoughts?

26:50.834 --> 26:52.186
You don't have to act like this.

26:52.210 --> 26:54.494
We're all in the same situation here.

26:54.792 --> 26:57.030
Just because you're breathing
doesn't mean you're alive

26:57.293 --> 26:59.452
but I like your new attitude.

26:59.751 --> 27:02.035
Let's see how tough you really are.

27:02.335 --> 27:04.244
Nicky, teach her a lesson!

27:06.876 --> 27:07.915
I don't wanna fight her.

27:08.126 --> 27:09.660
Can't we just lay off her today?

27:15.584 --> 27:17.538
Are you having feelings, Nicky?

27:17.834 --> 27:19.073
No!

27:19.376 --> 27:20.910
She's just scared.

27:21.210 --> 27:23.573
Haven't we initiated her well enough?

27:26.959 --> 27:28.743
On your knees!

27:29.043 --> 27:30.452
I said on your fucking knees!

27:36.792 --> 27:38.906
On all fours, like a dog.

27:48.293 --> 27:49.747
Now lick!

27:50.043 --> 27:51.452
Nice and slow.

27:52.542 --> 27:53.541
Yeah.

27:54.210 --> 27:57.915
Charli, kick this twat's ass, no excuses.

28:05.834 --> 28:07.494
Please, I don't want any trouble.

28:09.751 --> 28:11.490
We don't have a choice.

28:19.251 --> 28:20.250
Oh yeah.

28:36.251 --> 28:37.534
That's the spirit!

29:03.626 --> 29:04.990
Blood in the water.

29:14.959 --> 29:17.323
Oh yeah, that's the way.

29:52.043 --> 29:53.042
Finish her!

30:12.084 --> 30:13.083
Yes!

30:13.751 --> 30:15.115
Yes!

30:26.418 --> 30:28.906
All right, everybody
up against the wall.

30:29.210 --> 30:30.324
Now!

30:30.626 --> 30:31.625
Now you heard the man.

30:35.210 --> 30:36.209
Really, val?

30:37.210 --> 30:37.868
You know what they say,

30:38.168 --> 30:41.748
ID you can't beat them,
arrange to have them beaten.

30:42.043 --> 30:43.702
What the fuck is wrong with you?

30:44.001 --> 30:45.000
It's complicated.

30:51.418 --> 30:52.936
With the assistance of gordo,

30:53.084 --> 30:55.868
I've been working on the ultimate device.

30:56.168 --> 30:57.997
I'm intrigued.

30:58.293 --> 31:00.747
Since the middle ages,
most interrogation equipment

31:01.043 --> 31:04.657
has focused on just a
few specific methods.

31:04.959 --> 31:08.914
So we've created a device
that will run a gamut of pain,

31:09.210 --> 31:11.869
all with the ability to
keep the subject conscious.

31:15.251 --> 31:16.989
I'm growing so weary of the vineyard.

31:18.001 --> 31:19.864
Not only does out
incredible torture machine

31:20.168 --> 31:21.906
have the ability to deliver these forms

31:22.210 --> 31:24.449
at a slow and deliberate pace,

31:24.751 --> 31:28.115
it also has the capacity to
bring forth instantaneous death.

31:29.335 --> 31:30.334
I see.

31:31.043 --> 31:33.498
This could be very useful
with multiple subjects.

31:34.751 --> 31:37.456
Kill the first, hardly maim the second

31:37.751 --> 31:38.830
and the third sings?

31:39.126 --> 31:40.285
Exactly.

31:40.584 --> 31:43.369
All bearing witness to
the subject before them.

31:43.667 --> 31:44.746
An interesting theory.

31:46.418 --> 31:48.622
You've always had a dark
imagination, my dear.

31:52.126 --> 31:53.910
It's more solid than science

31:55.168 --> 31:57.157
but I look forward to seeing your new toy.

31:58.126 --> 32:00.035
I've been taking a progressive approach.

32:02.418 --> 32:05.498
I have developed a sexual aversion serum,

32:05.792 --> 32:08.406
which causes a subject to
receive immense pleasure.

32:09.501 --> 32:13.411
The resulting euphoria
releases one's deepest desires.

32:15.376 --> 32:17.864
What first made itself as pleasure

32:18.168 --> 32:20.248
become unbearably repugnant,

32:20.542 --> 32:22.327
forcing a total cleanse of the soul.

32:23.376 --> 32:24.375
A hippie drug.

32:25.293 --> 32:26.656
Oh no.

32:26.959 --> 32:29.914
Their greatest delights
become their innermost fears.

32:30.210 --> 32:31.618
A bad trip.

32:31.918 --> 32:32.917
No, my dear.

32:33.792 --> 32:35.031
They find their one true god

32:35.335 --> 32:37.119
leading to a moral and just life.

32:38.376 --> 32:39.705
Easy to control.

32:42.792 --> 32:44.530
I don't think you're comprehending this.

32:44.834 --> 32:47.789
They become enlightened
to the word, born again.

32:48.084 --> 32:49.323
What's the point of that?

32:50.876 --> 32:51.875
Yes?

32:52.626 --> 32:53.625
Sorry to disturb you

32:53.667 --> 32:55.872
but a really weird cat
fight just broke out.

32:56.168 --> 32:58.327
Well, sounds like a job for management.

32:58.626 --> 33:00.081
Was there an escape attempt?

33:00.376 --> 33:02.580
Oh no, I got everything under control.

33:02.876 --> 33:04.240
This couldn't wait?

33:04.542 --> 33:05.810
Well, we were just wondering how

33:05.834 --> 33:07.233
to proceed with disciplinary action

33:07.460 --> 33:10.573
since it was of such a
bizarre, sexual nature.

33:12.542 --> 33:15.202
I'll need the subject
for my demonstration.

33:15.501 --> 33:17.036
I'll question the inmates myself.

33:17.335 --> 33:18.334
Yes, ma'am.

33:20.126 --> 33:21.331
Line up the subordinates.

33:21.626 --> 33:23.490
I'll get to the bottom of this.

33:23.792 --> 33:25.872
You know, as a child
I always looked forward

33:26.168 --> 33:27.327
to feeding time at the zoo.

33:28.418 --> 33:29.747
Lead the way, little keeper.

34:06.542 --> 34:07.541
"Covert."

34:08.792 --> 34:12.452
"Not openly acknowledged or displayed."

34:12.751 --> 34:13.285
Okay.

34:13.584 --> 34:14.583
"Secret."

34:14.751 --> 34:15.750
"Clandestine."

34:16.667 --> 34:17.781
"Hidden."

34:18.084 --> 34:20.368
"Cloak and goddamn dagger."

34:20.667 --> 34:21.826
"Undercover."

34:22.126 --> 34:23.125
I get it.

34:23.168 --> 34:24.167
I don't think you do!

34:25.709 --> 34:26.914
Tell me this.

34:27.210 --> 34:28.888
What dumb ass Abbey you been going through

34:29.126 --> 34:30.884
that has you thinking
that ripping the ticker

34:31.168 --> 34:34.282
out of an eel fisherman in
broad motherfucking daylight

34:34.584 --> 34:37.369
as hush motherfucking
hush operations, huh?

34:37.667 --> 34:39.306
I heard how you did it back in the day.

34:39.376 --> 34:41.955
Go in, kick ass and raise headstones,

34:42.251 --> 34:43.410
not fucking flags.

34:43.709 --> 34:45.039
You know, we weren't privileged

34:45.335 --> 34:47.698
to have the intelling
tools as you guys have.

34:48.001 --> 34:49.456
Whatever.

34:49.751 --> 34:50.910
Seriously, girl.

34:51.210 --> 34:52.618
Seriously!

34:52.918 --> 34:54.577
You don't know shit!

34:55.501 --> 34:57.115
Look around you.

34:57.418 --> 34:58.997
There's red velvet ants in these ruins.

34:59.293 --> 35:01.373
They're actually called wingless wasps,

35:01.667 --> 35:04.077
known as "cow killers" by the locals.

35:04.376 --> 35:07.080
Girl, they will paralyze
your kennel-chewing ass

35:07.376 --> 35:08.614
within seconds

35:08.918 --> 35:11.622
and that's when the
carnivorous ants come in

35:11.918 --> 35:15.328
and they will strip
your scrawny bones dry.

35:16.501 --> 35:17.910
You known, you would've known that

35:18.210 --> 35:20.489
if you would've went over the
briefings before you met me,

35:20.626 --> 35:22.456
but you didn't, I know.

35:22.751 --> 35:23.750
[ Prepped.

35:23.876 --> 35:24.580
Prepped.

35:24.876 --> 35:26.490
Girl, you read that thing for 30 seconds

35:26.792 --> 35:29.576
and went right back to
the damn social media.

35:29.876 --> 35:31.240
You're taking me out?

35:31.542 --> 35:32.872
I should lose my goddamn self

35:33.834 --> 35:36.914
but I'm gonna give you one last chance.

35:37.210 --> 35:39.823
Now, go find some shade, not here,

35:40.126 --> 35:41.534
and go over the damn briefings!

35:41.834 --> 35:42.368
Okay.

35:42.667 --> 35:43.866
Don't make me come back here

35:44.043 --> 35:45.311
because I'm telling you right now,

35:45.335 --> 35:48.039
I will blow this
motherfucker to kingdom come

35:48.335 --> 35:49.436
and if there just happens to be

35:49.460 --> 35:51.494
some friendly fire in you direction,

35:51.792 --> 35:52.791
so be it.

35:52.918 --> 35:53.997
Yes, ma'am.

35:54.293 --> 35:56.247
Now go do your damn job!

35:56.542 --> 35:58.952
I need to know if five is alive

35:59.251 --> 36:01.035
and kill that motherfucking Jett Bryant!

36:47.001 --> 36:49.331
Cock-o express is leaving.

36:49.626 --> 36:50.990
Subbases by sundown.

36:52.667 --> 36:54.031
Zip-a-Dee-doo-dah,

36:54.335 --> 36:55.334
zip-a-Dee...

36:56.792 --> 36:57.791
Yay.

36:58.959 --> 37:00.788
Without order,

37:01.084 --> 37:02.743
there can be no rehabilitation.

37:05.792 --> 37:07.826
Without rehabilitation,

37:08.792 --> 37:10.655
there is no release.

37:11.584 --> 37:13.119
It's that simple.

37:14.542 --> 37:16.202
There is no escape.

37:17.834 --> 37:19.868
So I give you two choices.

37:21.210 --> 37:22.209
Order

37:23.168 --> 37:24.327
or death.

37:26.584 --> 37:29.618
Since you are property, I
believe this to be fair.

37:29.918 --> 37:30.917
[I wasn't involved.

37:30.959 --> 37:31.958
Silence!

37:34.376 --> 37:35.375
Order

37:36.168 --> 37:37.452
or death!

37:39.335 --> 37:41.698
Your subjects are dirty harlots.

37:42.001 --> 37:42.705
Sodomites.

37:43.001 --> 37:44.331
Unclean sinners.

37:44.626 --> 37:45.665
Yeah, they was fighting.

37:45.876 --> 37:46.875
Finger in flaps.

37:47.001 --> 37:48.955
All kinds of weird, kinky pervert stuff.

37:49.251 --> 37:49.784
Enough.

37:50.084 --> 37:51.311
They was about to scissor each other.

37:51.335 --> 37:52.334
Enough!

37:54.959 --> 37:55.958
So, val,

37:58.584 --> 38:00.494
who's our dissident today?

38:06.709 --> 38:07.708
The ginger sardine.

38:09.501 --> 38:10.500
I see.

38:12.043 --> 38:13.248
She put up a good fight.

38:14.251 --> 38:16.080
You don't look the type.

38:16.376 --> 38:18.239
Please, I just wanna go home.

38:19.376 --> 38:21.989
We just want to ask you a few questions.

38:22.293 --> 38:23.292
Can I use the phone?

38:24.709 --> 38:25.243
She'll do.

38:25.542 --> 38:26.541
Grab her.

38:26.584 --> 38:28.143
Your Nazi meat flaps are gonna get it

38:28.418 --> 38:30.872
when the revolution comes, you sick gash.

38:31.168 --> 38:32.167
Pardon?

38:32.251 --> 38:35.115
Yeah, we know all about you.

38:35.418 --> 38:37.872
I guess my accolades are
well-known internationally

38:38.168 --> 38:40.031
but fame is not what I seek.

38:40.335 --> 38:43.415
No, you go wherever
you can find a soggy box.

38:43.709 --> 38:45.164
You like it both way, don't you?

38:45.460 --> 38:46.994
That's how you get your twisted kicks?

38:47.293 --> 38:48.781
Pain makes you come, doesn't it?

38:49.959 --> 38:52.073
Fetishes are for those with free time.

38:52.376 --> 38:53.864
I have none.

38:54.918 --> 38:57.328
I look forward to your confession.

38:57.626 --> 38:58.705
Grab this one instead.

39:01.168 --> 39:02.872
I'm sure this will be amusing.

39:03.168 --> 39:05.122
But may I barrow a few of these strumpets

39:05.418 --> 39:06.531
for my demonstration later?

39:09.043 --> 39:10.282
Any in particular?

39:13.043 --> 39:13.747
Take them all.

39:14.043 --> 39:15.498
You bitch!

39:15.792 --> 39:17.452
I wouldn't want to separate you.

39:17.751 --> 39:18.750
Val?

39:20.251 --> 39:22.739
Maybe next time you'll find
your way around a honeypot

39:23.043 --> 39:24.202
instead of penning a fence!

39:24.501 --> 39:25.865
[ Hate you!

39:26.168 --> 39:27.407
Everybody does.

39:27.709 --> 39:28.708
Enough!

39:30.043 --> 39:31.042
They'll do nicely.

39:32.709 --> 39:33.828
I can't wait to get started.

39:34.043 --> 39:36.123
You'll have your chance.

39:36.418 --> 39:39.122
Until we're ready, throw these
prisoners in the hot box.

39:43.667 --> 39:45.019
Couldn't look the other way, huh?

39:45.043 --> 39:46.157
No, Holmes.

39:46.460 --> 39:47.560
I thought we were brothers?

39:47.584 --> 39:49.914
And you've had tacos
before too, I know it.

39:50.210 --> 39:53.744
Look, I took the distributor
cap from the plane.

39:54.043 --> 39:56.498
Don't get anymore bright ideas.

39:56.792 --> 39:57.871
I can't trust you now.

39:58.168 --> 39:59.531
I like you.

39:59.834 --> 40:01.369
I really do.

40:01.667 --> 40:02.906
You're an amusing fellow.

40:03.210 --> 40:04.823
Then let's split!

40:05.126 --> 40:06.864
I can't let you go.

40:07.168 --> 40:08.622
They'll cut off my head.

40:09.876 --> 40:13.411
If we try and leave
together, they'll find us.

40:14.418 --> 40:16.372
They'll cut off our heads.

40:17.501 --> 40:20.581
The only way to keep our heads

40:20.876 --> 40:23.956
is if we stay right here.

40:25.834 --> 40:27.118
I wanna keep my head.

40:27.418 --> 40:29.077
Me too, Holmes.

40:29.376 --> 40:30.455
Me too.

40:33.001 --> 40:34.535
What you reading over there?

40:34.834 --> 40:36.743
"The social contract" by Rousseau.

40:37.043 --> 40:38.656
This is some heavy shit, man.

40:38.959 --> 40:40.038
Marx is better.

40:40.335 --> 40:42.324
Thomas paine's "common sense," dude.

40:42.626 --> 40:43.740
Machiavelli.

40:44.043 --> 40:45.042
Fuck that guy.

40:45.251 --> 40:47.490
Martin Luther fucking king Jr.'s letter

40:47.792 --> 40:49.701
from a Birmingham jail, bitch.

40:50.001 --> 40:51.456
"The art of the deal."

40:58.501 --> 41:00.206
What a piece of shit.

41:00.501 --> 41:01.500
Yeah.

41:02.335 --> 41:03.334
Well, if I'm stuck here

41:03.501 --> 41:04.900
I might as well go among the people

41:05.168 --> 41:07.031
and see what I can do
to better their lives,

41:07.335 --> 41:08.810
while I'm in a position of power and all.

41:08.834 --> 41:10.788
I wouldn't do that if I was you, Holmes.

41:11.084 --> 41:13.948
Yeah, I know it's a token
position with no real power.

41:15.251 --> 41:17.160
But I'll get to know their problems.

41:17.460 --> 41:19.414
Okay, Holmes.

41:19.709 --> 41:22.164
Maybe seeing the
empathy of their president

41:22.460 --> 41:24.039
will better their lives

41:24.335 --> 41:26.744
and bring around some
real positive change.

42:03.834 --> 42:05.164
What the fuck?!

42:10.126 --> 42:11.830
Prisoner 731.

42:13.251 --> 42:16.456
Are you an associate of ks-13?

42:16.751 --> 42:17.750
Go to hell!

42:18.418 --> 42:20.576
I expected such a response.

42:21.876 --> 42:25.161
Dear, you are merely
part of a demonstration

42:25.460 --> 42:28.869
of the greatest information
extractor ever developed.

42:30.293 --> 42:32.327
The incredible torture machine.

42:34.126 --> 42:36.535
The pain will be deep.

42:36.834 --> 42:40.289
Deliberately slow and quite unbearable.

42:41.293 --> 42:42.292
Fascinating.

42:44.210 --> 42:45.823
There will be a moment,

42:47.001 --> 42:48.490
maybe an hour,

42:49.542 --> 42:53.702
perhaps a day when you realize
that death 1s inevitable

42:54.001 --> 42:55.990
and you will reveal all that you know.

42:57.293 --> 42:59.031
It is merely up to you to decide

42:59.335 --> 43:01.869
how grotesquely disfigured
you would like to be

43:02.168 --> 43:04.373
before that time comes.

43:04.667 --> 43:05.666
Fuck you!

43:06.751 --> 43:08.865
The controls can be set
to keep the prisoner alive

43:09.168 --> 43:11.747
anywhere from 12 minutes to 12 months.

43:12.043 --> 43:14.656
Inquisition them all, I assume.

43:14.959 --> 43:16.868
The machine is equipped
with adrenalin shots

43:17.168 --> 43:19.157
to keep the subject cognoscente

43:19.460 --> 43:21.789
and also has the ability
to cauterize wounds

43:22.084 --> 43:24.572
to extend the interrogation process.

43:33.126 --> 43:34.125
What is happening?

43:34.959 --> 43:36.572
Turn the machine off!

43:36.876 --> 43:37.875
Turn it off!

43:47.251 --> 43:48.250
Oh my.

43:48.792 --> 43:50.281
I'm not sure what went wrong.

43:51.834 --> 43:54.073
A small child rubbing
the power girl with feces

43:54.376 --> 43:55.580
would've been more affective.

43:57.251 --> 43:58.534
This is unacceptable.

43:59.501 --> 44:01.831
What about our aspirations?

44:02.126 --> 44:03.456
My dream?

44:03.751 --> 44:05.331
Back to the drawing board for you.

44:06.460 --> 44:09.494
My dear, I believe it's
the good doctor's turn

44:10.584 --> 44:13.869
and I'm confident you'll find
the results quite enlightening

44:14.168 --> 44:15.167
and less

44:16.667 --> 44:17.666
messy.

45:14.834 --> 45:16.618
I think these snakes are endangered.

45:16.918 --> 45:17.917
You got lucky.

45:18.001 --> 45:19.490
They have big plans for you girls.

45:21.542 --> 45:23.202
Hey, I made the call.

45:23.501 --> 45:24.035
Really?

45:24.335 --> 45:25.733
Yeah but all I got was computers.

45:25.834 --> 45:27.852
They kept bouncing me around
from different computer voices

45:27.876 --> 45:28.580
for an hour and a half.

45:28.876 --> 45:29.875
Oh no.

45:30.001 --> 45:31.000
I'll try again later.

45:31.293 --> 45:32.747
I'm sorry about all this.

45:33.043 --> 45:34.082
I heard about the turtles.

45:34.376 --> 45:35.739
I like critters too.

45:36.043 --> 45:36.576
Hang in there.

45:36.876 --> 45:37.875
Where's ebony?

45:38.043 --> 45:39.077
You'll see her soon

45:39.376 --> 45:40.852
but first they want you to get some chow

45:40.876 --> 45:42.206
so you have your strength back.

45:42.501 --> 45:43.620
They seem to be very excited

45:43.709 --> 45:45.348
for whatever they have cooked up for you.

46:19.751 --> 46:23.411
Once upon a time there
were a bunch of little cunts

46:23.709 --> 46:25.198
who forgot who their queen bee was.

46:25.501 --> 46:26.580
Will you give it a rest?

46:26.876 --> 46:29.035
Oh, do I here some buzzing?

46:29.335 --> 46:30.334
Can we just drop it?

46:30.626 --> 46:31.160
No!

46:31.460 --> 46:32.459
I don't think we can!

46:32.626 --> 46:34.081
I don't think you get it!

46:34.376 --> 46:34.909
Get what?

46:35.210 --> 46:37.994
Now that wardress Von krupp's in charge,

46:38.293 --> 46:41.498
none of you drones are
flying out of here alive.

46:41.792 --> 46:45.576
So you may as well make the
best of the last of your life.

46:45.876 --> 46:47.411
Nobody cares what you have to say.

46:47.709 --> 46:48.948
Oh, I think you should.

46:49.251 --> 46:50.989
It's in everyone's best interest

46:51.293 --> 46:54.622
to be where the cream rises to the top.

46:54.918 --> 46:57.531
That is if you wanna live
a little before we all die.

46:58.542 --> 47:01.077
Stay alive by sucking your nasty tunnel?

47:01.376 --> 47:02.375
Give me death.

47:02.626 --> 47:04.865
That can be arranged!

47:05.168 --> 47:07.656
Now you little chicks best fall in line

47:07.959 --> 47:09.102
and make the most of your time.

47:09.126 --> 47:10.160
Don't listen to her!

47:10.460 --> 47:12.289
Ebony was taken away
for a fucking cigarette

47:12.584 --> 47:14.618
and she'll trade you too, she's crazy.

47:14.918 --> 47:15.917
A fucking monster!

47:16.126 --> 47:17.240
A crazy monster.

47:17.542 --> 47:18.076
Oh yeah,

47:18.376 --> 47:21.490
we're about to get all monster
crazy up in this bitch!

47:24.667 --> 47:25.247
Would you like to Grant

47:25.542 --> 47:27.497
any of your acquaintances a reprieve?

47:29.043 --> 47:30.122
These clams?

47:31.918 --> 47:32.917
Harvest them all.

47:34.918 --> 47:35.952
Cunt!

47:36.251 --> 47:37.614
As property of the Republic,

47:37.918 --> 47:40.248
you have been chosen to
take part in an experiment

47:40.542 --> 47:42.952
conducted by Dr. greeley.

47:43.251 --> 47:44.864
Sir Dr. greeley.

47:45.168 --> 47:46.167
I was knighted.

47:46.918 --> 47:49.123
We expect your full cooperation.

47:49.418 --> 47:50.417
Where is ebony?

47:53.001 --> 47:55.160
I hear she's joining
you in this experiment.

47:57.376 --> 47:59.239
Well, in a way she is.

47:59.542 --> 48:00.852
What is this asshole talking about?

48:00.876 --> 48:02.490
Where is ebony?

48:02.792 --> 48:04.327
You are consuming her.

48:05.460 --> 48:06.164
What?

48:06.460 --> 48:08.698
A most embarrassing
situation for the wardress,

48:09.001 --> 48:09.534
I assure you.

48:09.834 --> 48:12.118
What the fuck is he talking about?!

48:12.418 --> 48:14.576
You are eating her, my dear.

48:14.876 --> 48:16.206
Butchers!

48:16.501 --> 48:17.035
It was my idea, obviously.

48:17.335 --> 48:18.494
I'll kill you!

48:23.335 --> 48:27.119
Shall we begin nighty-night
at your insubordination inn?

48:28.834 --> 48:29.833
Proceed.

49:34.043 --> 49:35.042
Let me inside.

49:50.542 --> 49:53.407
You will drink your sister's cup,

49:53.709 --> 49:55.698
a cup large and deep.

49:56.001 --> 49:57.830
It will bring scorn and derision,

49:58.126 --> 50:00.739
for it holds so much.

50:01.043 --> 50:03.873
You'll be filled with
drunkenness and sorrow.

50:05.001 --> 50:07.160
A cup of ruin and desolation.

50:08.709 --> 50:11.823
You will drink it and drain it dry

50:12.126 --> 50:14.865
and chew on its pieces

50:15.168 --> 50:17.622
and you will tear your breast.

50:18.626 --> 50:19.910
Bring a mob against them

50:20.959 --> 50:24.039
and turn them over to terror and plunder.

50:25.876 --> 50:28.740
Stone them and cut them down!

50:29.043 --> 50:29.656
Enough!

50:29.959 --> 50:32.789
[ Will put an end to
lewdness in the land

50:33.084 --> 50:35.663
that all women may take warning

50:35.959 --> 50:37.618
and not imitate you!

50:40.210 --> 50:41.823
I said, enough!

50:44.084 --> 50:47.323
You will suffer the
penalty for your lewdness

50:47.626 --> 50:51.706
and bear the consequence
of your sins and idolatry.

50:52.834 --> 50:55.289
I command you to stop this instant!

50:55.584 --> 51:00.370
Then you will know 1
am the sovereign lord.

51:08.792 --> 51:09.951
Guards!

51:14.168 --> 51:15.407
Seize him!

51:23.335 --> 51:24.334
Change is good.

51:25.667 --> 51:27.122
The money's better.

51:27.418 --> 51:29.247
Those people are awful, man.

51:29.542 --> 51:30.951
Just awful.

51:31.251 --> 51:32.989
Let's fly the fuck out of here.

51:33.293 --> 51:34.656
I'd even take your family.

51:34.959 --> 51:36.323
Beer tacos for everybody.

51:38.210 --> 51:39.209
Bryant located.

51:39.501 --> 51:40.580
Eliminating target.

51:43.959 --> 51:45.697
How much are they paying you?

51:46.001 --> 51:47.160
Who?

51:47.460 --> 51:47.993
What do you mean, who?

51:48.293 --> 51:49.292
The cartel.

51:50.376 --> 51:51.375
Nothing.

51:51.584 --> 51:52.789
Nothin'.

51:53.084 --> 51:54.243
I mean, they used to.

51:55.251 --> 51:56.534
Then they said I fucked up.

51:57.834 --> 52:01.073
Luckily for me, I married to
one of Don olvidados' cousins.

52:02.084 --> 52:03.822
They just let me live for now.

52:04.126 --> 52:05.160
Balls.

52:05.460 --> 52:06.618
Jett Bryant?

52:06.918 --> 52:07.917
Whoa, whoa, whoa, lady!

52:08.084 --> 52:09.323
Ain't no need for gun pointing!

52:09.418 --> 52:10.417
Are you American?

52:10.626 --> 52:12.706
I was sent by ks-13 to deliver a message

52:13.001 --> 52:14.660
from the United States of America.

52:14.959 --> 52:16.198
Well hallelujah!

52:16.501 --> 52:18.831
Your time as president of
the Republic of rattica is...

52:19.126 --> 52:20.534
Hold on, girl.

52:20.834 --> 52:22.369
I'm American too.

52:22.667 --> 52:23.746
Expired.

52:24.043 --> 52:25.521
You can lower that weapon, darling,

52:25.584 --> 52:27.023
there's been a big misunderstanding.

52:27.293 --> 52:28.372
I'm not who you think I am.

52:28.542 --> 52:30.372
Or you can keep it raised if you want,

52:30.667 --> 52:32.031
I'm ready to do my time.

52:32.335 --> 52:33.994
As long as it's in the goddamn us of a.

52:34.293 --> 52:34.997
Shut up!

52:35.293 --> 52:37.531
Preferably not Alabama
but anything will do.

52:37.834 --> 52:38.833
Got a ride off this rock?

52:39.043 --> 52:40.997
This rock will Mark your grave.

52:43.251 --> 52:44.643
Little girl, give me three steps.

52:44.667 --> 52:45.781
I ain't who you think I am.

52:46.084 --> 52:47.822
Not my mission, not my problem.

52:48.126 --> 52:49.955
I'm just doing a job.

52:50.251 --> 52:52.080
Will you get her off
my back or something?

52:52.376 --> 52:53.814
[Agent sixxl stupid piece of shit!

52:54.043 --> 52:55.157
Well, well, well.

52:55.460 --> 52:58.369
Look who's all out of
yippee ki-yay motherfuckers.

52:58.667 --> 53:00.076
Kill squad 13 gun?

53:00.376 --> 53:00.909
Yeah.

53:01.210 --> 53:03.164
You gotta activate it first.

53:03.460 --> 53:03.993
What?

53:04.293 --> 53:06.077
You gotta put the gun
to your compy wrist.

53:06.376 --> 53:08.035
You gotta activate if first.

53:08.335 --> 53:08.914
Come on.

53:09.210 --> 53:09.914
Oh yeah, right.

53:10.210 --> 53:11.209
Thanks.

53:11.251 --> 53:12.250
No problem.

53:13.584 --> 53:14.948
Whose side are you on anyway?

53:15.251 --> 53:16.534
No side.

53:16.834 --> 53:18.227
Don't you wanna here my evil plan?

53:18.251 --> 53:18.909
Don't care.

53:19.210 --> 53:19.743
Really?

53:20.043 --> 53:21.436
I was gonna improv
something for your amusement

53:21.460 --> 53:24.539
but all right then,
let's get it over with.

53:24.834 --> 53:26.663
Take the safety off.

53:26.959 --> 53:27.538
Really?

53:27.834 --> 53:29.663
I assume she's gonna kill you too.

53:29.959 --> 53:31.414
You're gonna kill him too, right?

53:32.709 --> 53:34.039
You know, darling,

53:34.335 --> 53:36.164
handsome is only a light switch away.

53:36.460 --> 53:38.573
I'll give you one more
chance to take me with you.

53:38.876 --> 53:40.535
The only place you're going is down.

54:01.251 --> 54:02.490
Whoa.

54:02.792 --> 54:04.327
What the fuck is this?

54:04.626 --> 54:05.625
Bottomless pit.

54:05.834 --> 54:07.414
Where does that go?

54:07.709 --> 54:08.948
[T's bottomless.

54:10.501 --> 54:11.660
Yeah, I understand that.

54:11.959 --> 54:13.917
I was just wondering if
it goes to the molten core

54:14.168 --> 54:15.247
or goddamn China.

54:17.251 --> 54:19.160
There's been a slight misunderstanding.

54:19.460 --> 54:20.852
Watch out for the earth's butt hole.

54:20.876 --> 54:21.875
It's bottomless.

54:22.959 --> 54:24.243
Where does that pit go?

54:26.709 --> 54:28.118
So should I pack my bags?

54:28.418 --> 54:30.498
Dr. greeley's services
will no longer be needed

54:30.792 --> 54:32.701
in the interrogation of prisoners.

54:33.001 --> 54:34.000
Fantastic!

54:34.251 --> 54:36.205
I guess it's checking out
at the banana Republic.

54:36.501 --> 54:37.500
I don't give two shits.

54:37.751 --> 54:38.365
Sit.

54:38.667 --> 54:40.406
I will inform the cartel of the changes.

54:40.709 --> 54:43.414
Why don't we let the acting
president make a decision?

54:43.709 --> 54:45.507
I'm sure he would like
his assassins uncovered

54:45.751 --> 54:47.411
as quickly as possible

54:47.709 --> 54:49.228
by the most affective means available.

54:49.501 --> 54:50.500
Tell me about it.

54:50.584 --> 54:52.538
Some chick was just in
here until cock blocker

54:52.834 --> 54:55.664
dropped my Princess down
Lucifer's fart locker.

54:55.959 --> 54:56.958
A ks-13 agent?

54:57.251 --> 54:57.830
Yeah.

54:58.126 --> 55:00.410
Another line of dialogue,
she'd been sweet on me too.

55:00.709 --> 55:01.852
Her interrogation could have

55:01.876 --> 55:03.739
brought us valuable information.

55:04.043 --> 55:06.123
I've never seen such
reckless inefficiency

55:06.418 --> 55:10.202
and sheer incompetence
on a grandiose scale.

55:10.501 --> 55:12.180
What we have is two
different philosophies.

55:12.460 --> 55:12.993
Oh brother.

55:13.293 --> 55:14.952
One that can achieve results

55:15.251 --> 55:17.490
and one that is grossly outdated

55:17.792 --> 55:19.156
and only serve to satiate

55:19.460 --> 55:21.664
her sadomasochistic desires.

55:21.959 --> 55:24.618
His narcissism has turned
him into a religious zealot

55:24.918 --> 55:27.032
who is attempting to
brainwash the inmates.

55:27.335 --> 55:28.664
Mind control?

55:28.959 --> 55:29.993
Of a sexual nature.

55:30.293 --> 55:30.951
Oh come on, man.

55:31.251 --> 55:32.614
What the fuck is your problem?

55:32.918 --> 55:34.077
I produce results.

55:34.376 --> 55:36.705
For what, getting your dick sucked?

55:37.001 --> 55:38.490
Dude, that is so uncool.

55:38.792 --> 55:40.746
I knew you were creepy,
I had that feeling.

55:42.251 --> 55:44.205
I knew you wouldn't understand.

55:44.501 --> 55:47.535
But inga, I was your mentor.

55:47.834 --> 55:49.073
Small wang, I reckon.

55:49.376 --> 55:51.035
Everything you are is because of me.

55:52.043 --> 55:53.042
I have evolved.

55:53.168 --> 55:54.781
Mother didn't love him.

55:55.084 --> 55:56.842
No one's gonna want
what you have to offer.

55:56.959 --> 55:58.414
Child abuse.

55:58.709 --> 55:59.323
Nailed it.

55:59.626 --> 56:01.615
Do you know why you experiments fail?

56:03.126 --> 56:04.534
You deserve it.

56:04.834 --> 56:05.833
Enough!

56:07.293 --> 56:09.452
Why do you make me
hurt you with the truth?

56:10.460 --> 56:12.289
Nobody here is gonna
believe you're capable

56:12.584 --> 56:14.039
of anything but failure.

56:14.335 --> 56:15.334
I said, enough!

56:16.210 --> 56:19.074
If you would shut your
ignorant mouth and listen,

56:20.418 --> 56:22.701
you would see that we could all be gods.

56:23.001 --> 56:25.240
You're just another
controlling cock sucker!

56:25.542 --> 56:26.826
I am a god!

56:29.126 --> 56:30.410
I am a god!

56:36.501 --> 56:37.660
Oh, fuck.

56:37.959 --> 56:39.743
I told that motherfucker
1 didn't like him.

56:40.043 --> 56:42.998
You all heard me say it to
him earlier, didn't you?

56:43.293 --> 56:45.373
Holmes, it bottom from the top.

56:45.667 --> 56:46.951
Bottomless.

56:47.251 --> 56:48.250
Yup.

56:50.876 --> 56:52.240
Are you girls okay?

56:52.542 --> 56:53.122
Hanging on.

56:53.418 --> 56:55.031
Let me take you back to your cells.

57:02.709 --> 57:03.368
Run!

57:03.667 --> 57:04.201
Get out of here!

57:04.501 --> 57:05.115
Come with us.

57:05.418 --> 57:06.935
There's something we have to do first.

57:06.959 --> 57:07.958
I understand.

57:11.293 --> 57:12.372
Go, get out of here!

57:12.667 --> 57:13.201
Thank you.

57:13.501 --> 57:14.500
Run, bitch!

57:21.667 --> 57:22.826
I think I know the way out.

57:23.084 --> 57:23.697
How?

57:24.001 --> 57:24.614
Nevermind.

57:24.918 --> 57:25.917
You point and I'll lead.

57:26.084 --> 57:27.868
I don't have many bullets left.

57:28.168 --> 57:28.701
Jade.

57:29.001 --> 57:29.534
What?

57:29.834 --> 57:31.164
Thank you.

57:31.460 --> 57:33.449
If we survive this,
you owe me a Margarita.

57:39.168 --> 57:40.167
No!

57:40.876 --> 57:41.875
Run!

57:42.626 --> 57:43.660
Save yourself.

57:43.959 --> 57:44.958
No!

57:45.918 --> 57:47.032
That's annoying.

57:49.667 --> 57:51.585
Maybe that's something
you should be checking on.

57:54.876 --> 57:56.660
You know, for someone
who hates work so much,

57:56.959 --> 57:57.958
I find it hard to believe

57:58.126 --> 58:00.115
you're not sitting on a siren free beach

58:00.418 --> 58:01.872
with old Jett, drinking a beer.

58:09.001 --> 58:10.739
Don't leave.

58:13.501 --> 58:14.894
Can you turn the
volume down on that horn

58:14.918 --> 58:15.917
while you're at it?

58:32.918 --> 58:33.917
Nice hole.

58:35.126 --> 58:36.240
Well hello.

58:36.542 --> 58:37.747
Are you here to kill me too?

58:38.918 --> 58:40.282
Hardly.

58:40.584 --> 58:41.583
Well, all right.

58:41.667 --> 58:42.666
I'm val.

58:42.876 --> 58:44.115
Who are you?

58:44.418 --> 58:45.417
Jett.

58:45.667 --> 58:47.426
I was pulling the old
"one more for the road"

58:47.501 --> 58:48.660
lido shuffle bit,

58:48.959 --> 58:51.164
hit this pad to weed up my ride.

58:51.460 --> 58:55.040
Next thing I know, cartel has
promoted me to human pifiata.

58:56.001 --> 58:57.000
Is there more?

58:57.792 --> 58:58.791
I like to party.

59:01.251 --> 59:03.240
So, val, what're you in for?

59:03.542 --> 59:06.327
Tell me it's not cutting off
somebody's balls and taint

59:06.626 --> 59:08.785
and shoving them up their
turd cunt or some weird shit.

59:10.460 --> 59:11.618
Oh, no.

59:11.918 --> 59:14.282
I'm an innocent victim in all of this.

59:14.584 --> 59:16.198
Just like you.

59:16.501 --> 59:17.580
Tell me about it.

59:20.709 --> 59:22.073
Really?

59:22.376 --> 59:23.375
I got time.

59:25.168 --> 59:27.031
It wasn't always a battlefield.

59:28.168 --> 59:30.157
Before the war on drugs started,

59:30.460 --> 59:32.573
this was a peaceful nation.

59:32.876 --> 59:34.705
My family were honored dignitaries

59:35.001 --> 59:38.365
and they threw the most grand
and lavish dinner parties.

59:38.667 --> 59:40.452
My mother was a heavy
financial contributor

59:40.751 --> 59:43.911
to the orchids research
facility at the university.

59:44.210 --> 59:45.948
She was quite the botanist too.

59:46.251 --> 59:48.910
Her greenhouses were full of rothschilds

59:49.210 --> 59:52.790
and professionals all over the
world would fly to see them.

59:53.084 --> 59:56.618
You never saw such beautiful
flowers in all your life.

59:56.918 --> 59:58.952
But my favorites were the Juliet roses

59:59.251 --> 1:00:00.910
with all their blushing glory.

1:00:02.542 --> 1:00:05.747
One time we had this huge,
important dinner party

1:00:06.043 --> 1:00:08.952
and we had dignitaries flying
in from all over the world.

1:00:10.043 --> 1:00:11.656
So I snuck into my mother's greenhouse

1:00:11.959 --> 1:00:14.572
and I removed all those expensive flowers.

1:00:14.876 --> 1:00:15.875
I was young.

1:00:17.001 --> 1:00:19.115
I just wanted to fill
up all of our fountains

1:00:19.418 --> 1:00:23.327
with their exquisite beauty to
share with those dignitaries.

1:00:23.626 --> 1:00:26.161
I knew how important this was.

1:00:26.460 --> 1:00:29.664
I just wanted everybody to
see the beauty and whimsy

1:00:29.959 --> 1:00:31.368
that my family shared.

1:00:33.542 --> 1:00:34.656
Yeah, mother was furious

1:00:34.959 --> 1:00:36.868
when she saw what I did to her garden

1:00:37.168 --> 1:00:41.782
but farther, he said the sight
brought tears to his soul.

1:00:42.084 --> 1:00:45.698
Just those beautiful,
delicate peddles on the water

1:00:46.001 --> 1:00:47.705
with the breeze just slightly parting them

1:00:48.001 --> 1:00:49.535
for a moment in time.

1:00:49.834 --> 1:00:52.323
Enough to let the reflection
of the moonlight through.

1:00:54.667 --> 1:00:55.666
Uh huh.

1:00:57.376 --> 1:00:58.864
You don't believe me?

1:00:59.168 --> 1:01:00.373
Not in the least bit.

1:01:01.792 --> 1:01:02.871
You're right.

1:01:03.168 --> 1:01:04.452
I'll whack off peckers.

1:01:04.751 --> 1:01:06.030
Wanna go make out on the roof?

1:01:06.084 --> 1:01:07.083
All right.

1:01:15.376 --> 1:01:16.375
Assessment.

1:01:17.792 --> 1:01:18.906
We're missing one.

1:01:19.210 --> 1:01:20.789
She's outside the wall.

1:01:21.084 --> 1:01:23.243
Probably making a break
for it across the marsh.

1:01:24.584 --> 1:01:26.323
Have you seen gordo?

1:01:26.626 --> 1:01:27.625
Nobody has.

1:01:29.876 --> 1:01:31.535
I do strive for perfection.

1:01:32.501 --> 1:01:35.081
There's no ambition within these walls.

1:01:35.376 --> 1:01:36.375
No one believes in me.

1:01:36.418 --> 1:01:38.156
Do you know how that feels?

1:01:38.460 --> 1:01:39.538
No, ma'am.

1:01:39.834 --> 1:01:41.323
Of course you don't.

1:01:41.626 --> 1:01:43.490
Before I got here, nothing ever got done.

1:01:44.501 --> 1:01:47.115
Do you think this place
can just run itself?

1:01:47.418 --> 1:01:50.077
Do you really think the world
can function without order?

1:01:51.918 --> 1:01:54.123
Before I got here you were
all just sitting around

1:01:54.418 --> 1:01:55.696
playing poker with the prisoners

1:01:55.792 --> 1:01:57.576
who came and went as they pleased.

1:01:58.709 --> 1:02:01.948
This institution was like
some sort of clubhouse

1:02:02.251 --> 1:02:04.864
but that's the way your
prefer it, don't you?

1:02:05.168 --> 1:02:08.202
Well you can all go back
to your miserable lives.

1:02:08.501 --> 1:02:10.911
I'm so sorry that
productivity and ambition

1:02:11.210 --> 1:02:12.869
had to enter the equation.

1:02:13.168 --> 1:02:14.186
So I can put a bullet in the head

1:02:14.210 --> 1:02:15.324
of this hurricane chomper?

1:02:15.626 --> 1:02:16.625
Do what you want.

1:02:17.418 --> 1:02:19.997
I'm going to tie up this
loose end and then I'm done.

1:02:26.667 --> 1:02:28.656
Come here, maggot face.

1:02:29.959 --> 1:02:32.164
This view almost makes me
wanna stick around awhile.

1:02:32.460 --> 1:02:33.459
Hmmm.

1:02:33.709 --> 1:02:35.789
I could stare at this forever.

1:02:36.084 --> 1:02:38.394
Why do you I get the feeling
you're about to push me off?

1:02:39.626 --> 1:02:41.785
Why don't you stick around and find out?

1:02:42.084 --> 1:02:43.618
I'm sticking to you, baby.

1:02:43.918 --> 1:02:44.917
Kiss me.

1:03:07.834 --> 1:03:08.993
I never miss.

1:03:16.792 --> 1:03:17.791
There you go.

1:03:29.043 --> 1:03:30.202
Getting closer.

1:03:31.876 --> 1:03:33.660
Where the hell have you been?

1:03:33.959 --> 1:03:36.414
Now I have to go out in the
marsh and finish her off.

1:03:38.335 --> 1:03:39.334
It's fixed?

1:03:40.335 --> 1:03:41.789
It will really work this time?

1:03:44.418 --> 1:03:46.656
The crocodiles can finish her off.

1:03:46.959 --> 1:03:49.039
I must see this with my own eyes.

1:03:49.335 --> 1:03:51.914
Gordo, I love you.

1:04:49.001 --> 1:04:50.535
Agent five.

1:04:50.834 --> 1:04:51.833
All is lost.

1:04:52.001 --> 1:04:53.331
Destroy target.

1:04:59.959 --> 1:05:01.697
Stop it, you son of a bitch.

1:05:05.293 --> 1:05:05.826
What are you doing?

1:05:06.126 --> 1:05:08.739
That crazy batshit wardress chick

1:05:09.043 --> 1:05:11.327
told me I had to fill
this asshole full of led.

1:05:11.626 --> 1:05:12.685
Well, hit him in the head.

1:05:12.709 --> 1:05:14.102
I'm gonna shoot this fucker in the head

1:05:14.126 --> 1:05:15.705
if it'll stand still.

1:05:16.001 --> 1:05:16.534
[T ain't a movie zombie.

1:05:16.834 --> 1:05:17.833
Tell him that.

1:05:18.043 --> 1:05:20.202
I done shot him in the gut three times.

1:05:20.501 --> 1:05:21.580
Let me get a crack at it.

1:05:21.876 --> 1:05:22.875
Get him.

1:05:30.126 --> 1:05:31.830
Shit, he bit me!

1:05:32.126 --> 1:05:34.019
Don't worry, don't worry,
you ain't gonna turn, okay?

1:05:34.043 --> 1:05:35.042
It don't mean nothing.

1:05:35.251 --> 1:05:36.534
He's just a mean son of a bitch.

1:05:36.834 --> 1:05:38.478
What do you say you
and me get a full clip

1:05:38.501 --> 1:05:40.081
and blow this crustoid to Detroit?

1:05:40.376 --> 1:05:41.614
Let's do it!

1:05:43.376 --> 1:05:45.160
Fuck that motherfucker!

1:05:47.834 --> 1:05:49.494
Oh, shit!

1:05:49.792 --> 1:05:51.951
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

1:05:52.251 --> 1:05:53.250
I'm shot bad!

1:05:53.501 --> 1:05:54.768
All right, hang in there, man.

1:05:56.001 --> 1:05:57.285
I'm so fucked!

1:05:57.584 --> 1:05:59.494
I was starry-eyed with
they threw me in here

1:05:59.792 --> 1:06:02.497
and they beat that out of me.

1:06:02.792 --> 1:06:05.202
I had to reinvent myself into
some kind of horrible monster

1:06:05.501 --> 1:06:07.411
just so they'd leave me alone.

1:06:07.709 --> 1:06:09.993
The biggest fella in the yard bit?

1:06:10.293 --> 1:06:11.327
Something like that.

1:06:12.501 --> 1:06:15.161
It became a power trip all on its own.

1:06:15.460 --> 1:06:17.018
I thought I could just fly down here,

1:06:17.126 --> 1:06:18.490
kiss the plane one last time time,

1:06:18.792 --> 1:06:20.031
whistle on down the road.

1:06:21.501 --> 1:06:22.831
I see hope in you.

1:06:23.126 --> 1:06:25.956
Living ain't easy but
it's all I know, you dig?

1:06:26.251 --> 1:06:27.250
You just need a friend.

1:06:27.542 --> 1:06:29.327
I'm thinking that's what it's all about.

1:06:29.626 --> 1:06:30.705
I'm getting sweet on you.

1:06:30.834 --> 1:06:32.198
Don't get too attached, darling.

1:06:32.501 --> 1:06:34.660
As soon as I get the
distributor cap for my plane,

1:06:34.959 --> 1:06:36.494
I'm halfway to splitsville.

1:06:36.792 --> 1:06:38.247
Whose got your cap?

1:06:38.542 --> 1:06:40.372
That joint bogart rocko character.

1:06:41.376 --> 1:06:42.080
Really?

1:06:42.376 --> 1:06:45.365
Yeah, a little bong chain,
beerless, mad at his sight.

1:06:45.667 --> 1:06:47.530
Is it like a black rubber thingy?

1:06:47.834 --> 1:06:48.493
Yeah.

1:06:48.792 --> 1:06:51.747
I lifted something like that
off of him this afternoon.

1:06:52.043 --> 1:06:53.781
If I get it, will you take me with you?

1:06:54.918 --> 1:06:56.077
You clepto hot momma!

1:06:56.376 --> 1:06:58.114
I'll even marry you if you want.

1:06:58.418 --> 1:07:00.122
Let's start with beer and tacos first.

1:07:00.418 --> 1:07:02.496
All right, I'll grab a
bag of cash from the office,

1:07:02.751 --> 1:07:04.894
you get that distributor cap
and meet me back here in five,

1:07:04.918 --> 1:07:05.622
we'll blow this fish locker.

1:07:05.918 --> 1:07:07.453
I love you.

1:07:11.460 --> 1:07:13.119
Are they coming to rescue you?

1:07:13.418 --> 1:07:13.951
Hardly.

1:07:14.251 --> 1:07:14.955
That chopper means business.

1:07:15.251 --> 1:07:16.410
Let's scoot!

1:07:20.584 --> 1:07:23.369
Hello, my little jungle comrades.

1:07:23.667 --> 1:07:24.666
Did you miss me?

1:07:25.959 --> 1:07:28.039
I'm back, motherfuckers!

1:07:31.335 --> 1:07:32.414
Where you going?

1:07:47.460 --> 1:07:48.118
The money!

1:07:48.418 --> 1:07:48.951
Huh?

1:07:49.251 --> 1:07:49.784
Go get the money!

1:07:50.084 --> 1:07:51.083
Yeah, right.

1:07:56.210 --> 1:07:57.249
The fort's under attack!

1:07:57.418 --> 1:07:57.951
[ Don't care!

1:07:58.251 --> 1:07:59.560
It does sound like armageddon out there.

1:07:59.584 --> 1:08:00.583
I don't fucking care.

1:08:00.751 --> 1:08:03.035
Let's just get this gate
open and get a good shot.

1:08:03.335 --> 1:08:03.868
Where's my?

1:08:04.168 --> 1:08:06.872
Where's my fucking keys, goddamn it!

1:08:07.168 --> 1:08:07.701
I'm gonna kill this motherfucker

1:08:08.001 --> 1:08:09.660
if it's the last thing I fucking do!

1:08:20.210 --> 1:08:21.789
Die motherfucker, die!

1:08:50.335 --> 1:08:51.948
The highest setting, please.

1:08:55.584 --> 1:08:57.538
Thank you, my friend.

1:10:30.335 --> 1:10:31.334
Dios mio!

1:16:01.959 --> 1:16:03.323
Not my beard!

1:16:03.626 --> 1:16:05.115
Not my beard!

1:17:02.792 --> 1:17:05.531
All right, guys, you
know what time it 1s.

1:17:05.834 --> 1:17:07.823
It's beer 30, closing time.

1:17:08.126 --> 1:17:09.955
And you know what they say.

1:17:10.251 --> 1:17:13.456
No witnesses mean nothing happened.

1:17:13.751 --> 1:17:14.750
Copy that.

1:17:14.959 --> 1:17:16.868
Good to have you back, blossom.

1:17:17.168 --> 1:17:19.702
Knew they couldn't keep
you behind a desk for long.

1:17:20.001 --> 1:17:23.161
All right, y'all, time to
drop a load of freedom.

1:17:23.460 --> 1:17:25.244
Say goodbye to the world as you know it.

1:17:53.376 --> 1:17:54.410
Lost my damn girl.

1:17:56.084 --> 1:17:57.802
I'm not sure what the
moral of the story is,

1:17:58.043 --> 1:17:59.042
but it ain't bottomless.

1:18:00.709 --> 1:18:02.448
A lot of dead people down there.

1:18:02.751 --> 1:18:04.186
Ain't gonna tell you what I had to do

1:18:04.210 --> 1:18:05.869
to get out of that situation.

1:18:06.168 --> 1:18:07.997
Pretty sure I'm gonna
be traumatized for life.

1:18:08.293 --> 1:18:09.292
Hold on.

1:18:10.293 --> 1:18:13.123
Get back to civilization,
the shock hasn't hit in.

1:18:13.418 --> 1:18:15.247
I'll tell you all about it over a taco.

1:18:15.542 --> 1:18:16.541
My treat.

1:18:17.210 --> 1:18:18.209
Buy me a beer?

1:18:18.376 --> 1:18:19.375
Hell yeah.
