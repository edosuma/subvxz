Am I finally dead?

This look like Hades to you?

13:24.413 --> 13:26.448
Well...

13:26.551 --> 13:28.793
I'll be.

13:30.172 --> 13:32.379
Is that you, Braedon?

13:34.827 --> 13:37.068
And Miss Mallory.

13:38.620 --> 13:41.000
Well, hey there, little Evelyn.

13:42.034 --> 13:44.000
There's Avery and Zachariah.

13:44.103 --> 13:46.206
Well, I-I can't tell you

13:46.310 --> 13:48.793
how good it is to be
back in Angel Springs.

13:48.896 --> 13:51.586
And so soon.

Now, listen.

13:53.827 --> 13:55.551
I know...

13:55.655 --> 13:58.103
I didn't leave here
under the best circumstances.

13:58.206 --> 14:00.379
You have every right
to be upset with me.

14:00.482 --> 14:02.068
For...

14:02.172 --> 14:04.275
pretending to be a preacher.

14:05.413 --> 14:08.517
For not finishing
this fine church.

14:09.448 --> 14:11.689

of such a...

14:11.793 --> 14:14.827

14:15.793 --> 14:17.793
I admit... I'm a sinner.

14:17.896 --> 14:19.379

14:19.482 --> 14:22.275
I have lived a life

14:22.379 --> 14:24.034

14:24.137 --> 14:26.896
and transgressions.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.724
I've robbed banks, trains and...

14:29.827 --> 14:31.586
two barbershops.

14:31.689 --> 14:33.448
Cheated at cards,

14:33.551 --> 14:35.620
gambled with dice and...

14:35.724 --> 14:37.758
well, broken many...

14:37.862 --> 14:40.103

14:58.965 --> 15:01.551
One, you didn't come back to us.

15:01.655 --> 15:03.137
I tracked you down,

15:03.241 --> 15:05.586
I knocked you flat
and I dragged you here.

15:05.689 --> 15:07.275
And two...

15:07.379 --> 15:10.206
I've already forgiven you
for what you done with my wife.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.241
Well, parting my hair
with that shovel

15:12.344 --> 15:14.310
would seem
to indicate otherwise.

16:01.482 --> 16:02.965
You know how much I appreciate

16:03.068 --> 16:05.344
the world famous
Angel Springs Distillery.

16:05.448 --> 16:08.310
Yeah, you and everyone else.

16:09.379 --> 16:12.000
Folks get wind that we can't
make our deliveries, then...

16:12.103 --> 16:13.551
whole town's finished.

16:13.655 --> 16:15.206
Why? What happened?

16:15.310 --> 16:17.517
-Well, you did.
-Huh?

16:17.620 --> 16:19.379
It's been nothing but trouble
since you left.

16:19.482 --> 16:21.103
Last two deliveries got robbed.

16:21.206 --> 16:24.206
They shot poor Fred there
in the leg.

16:24.310 --> 16:26.931
Well, look, if I'm so awful,
why... why bring me back?

16:27.034 --> 16:29.517
Well, we figured the best way
to protect this last run

16:29.620 --> 16:32.103
is to bring in someone
with criminal experience.

16:32.206 --> 16:34.517
Someone who knows the terrain.

16:34.620 --> 16:37.137
Someone who'll do it
for nothing.

16:39.724 --> 16:41.275
I'm not that cheap.

16:41.379 --> 16:43.620
Either that, or I could
have you finish that grave

16:43.724 --> 16:45.448
you were digging.

16:45.551 --> 16:46.965
[sighs] No need.

16:47.068 --> 16:48.724
I'm in.

16:53.103 --> 16:55.241
But in the meantime...

16:56.206 --> 16:58.689
...I might need to borrow
that shovel of yours.

17:07.068 --> 17:08.793
Why are you following me?
Humiliating me

17:08.896 --> 17:10.793
in front of Lucia wasn't enough?

17:10.896 --> 17:12.896
Oh, you did that just fine
by yourself.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.517
But when the horse you stole
came back

17:15.620 --> 17:17.379
without you on it,

17:17.482 --> 17:19.206
Lucia, she grew worried.

17:19.310 --> 17:21.206
And I figured
you needed some help.

17:21.310 --> 17:23.862
Listen to me, we ain't friends.

17:23.965 --> 17:26.793
And I sure as hell
don't need your help.

17:26.896 --> 17:28.551
Oh, so coming here
was your idea?

17:28.655 --> 17:31.034
Sure didn't sound like that
back there at the church.

17:31.137 --> 17:33.448
That is my business.

17:41.827 --> 17:43.241

17:43.344 --> 17:44.827
after all that excitement
the other day.

17:44.931 --> 17:46.344
Find your husband yet?

17:46.448 --> 17:47.965
No, I haven't.

17:48.068 --> 17:50.379
Um, I'm actually here
on a different matter.

17:50.482 --> 17:52.931
I have friends
who are facing an eviction.

17:53.034 --> 17:55.517
The Sullivans are your friends?
Huh.

17:55.620 --> 17:57.413
Didn't realize they had any.

17:57.517 --> 17:59.620
Well, uh, Mr. Morris,

17:59.724 --> 18:02.517
I was hoping to arrange
some sort of a payment plan?

18:03.586 --> 18:05.448
Afraid I can't.

18:05.551 --> 18:06.965
Oh, uh, why is that?

18:07.068 --> 18:08.517
Normally evictions take months.

18:08.620 --> 18:11.448
This case, however,
was personally expedited

18:11.551 --> 18:13.586
by the sheriff himself.

18:15.068 --> 18:17.137
Uh, what's, what's this, then?

18:17.241 --> 18:19.275
Uh, just a standard deed map.

18:19.379 --> 18:21.206
Shows, uh...

18:21.310 --> 18:23.379
the shop, and right up there

18:23.482 --> 18:26.206
is their 200 acres
just outside of town.

18:26.310 --> 18:28.517
Both were being held
as collateral.

18:33.517 --> 18:35.379
Oh, well, hello.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.758
I wasn't sure
if you could make it,

18:37.862 --> 18:39.482
what with your new job and all.

18:39.586 --> 18:40.965
How did you...

18:41.068 --> 18:42.482
Small town, big mouths.

18:42.586 --> 18:44.172
So...

18:44.275 --> 18:46.172
what's that handsome
new sheriff got you doing?

18:46.275 --> 18:48.551
-Anything interesting?
-Mm.

18:48.655 --> 18:50.379
Sad's more like it.

18:50.482 --> 18:52.827
I had to tell the Sullivan
sisters they're getting evicted.

18:52.931 --> 18:54.241
If they don't pay their debts

18:54.344 --> 18:55.931
by the end of the day,
they lose the store.

18:56.034 --> 18:57.586
What's more curious
is they'll also lose

18:57.689 --> 19:00.689
their land outside of town.
200 acres.

19:00.793 --> 19:03.068
See, now that just sounds like
a good old-fashioned land grab

19:03.172 --> 19:05.517
to me. I can help...

19:05.620 --> 19:07.689
if you want.
I feel sorry for those gals.

19:07.793 --> 19:09.379
Has it always been this bad?

19:09.482 --> 19:12.000
KAI: They used to do okay,
then as the...

19:12.103 --> 19:13.655
bickering got worse,

19:13.758 --> 19:15.379
so did the business.

19:15.482 --> 19:17.793
Now their customers,
they-they go to Austin

19:17.896 --> 19:19.172
to get what they need.

19:19.275 --> 19:21.206
Just to avoid
the unpleasantness.

19:21.310 --> 19:23.448
Kai, were you eavesdropping?

19:23.551 --> 19:25.517
Of course not.

19:26.931 --> 19:29.448
I can't control how loud you...

19:29.551 --> 19:33.000
-How-how loud people talk.
-Sure.

19:33.103 --> 19:35.517
And I may have overheard enough
to help.

19:35.620 --> 19:38.448
I know which people need
what items.

19:38.551 --> 19:41.586
The trick would be getting them
in the door.

19:41.689 --> 19:44.206
If we could convince
the sisters to stop fighting,

19:44.310 --> 19:46.862
then maybe people
would shop there again.

19:46.965 --> 19:49.482

and moved out so quickly.

38:26.827 --> 38:28.448
Oh, no, they're not leaving.

38:28.551 --> 38:30.965
They're just sold out.

38:32.241 --> 38:34.793
-Sold out of what?
-Everything, really.

38:34.896 --> 38:37.310
But don't worry, they have
a new shipment coming next week.

38:37.413 --> 38:40.034
They'll be back up and running
before you know it.

38:41.620 --> 38:43.172
They were supposed
to be evicted.

38:43.275 --> 38:45.758
Oh, I know.
I delivered your notice, but...

38:45.862 --> 38:48.482
I have to admit,
I didn't realize

38:48.586 --> 38:51.068
how smart your timing was.

38:52.206 --> 38:53.551
I'm not following.

Well, that notice was
just the push

38:55.793 --> 38:58.068
those sisters needed
to get their act together.

38:58.172 --> 39:00.724
They made enough
to pay their debts

39:00.827 --> 39:03.034
and then some.

39:04.241 --> 39:06.137
You should be proud.

39:06.241 --> 39:07.862
You've been here a week,

39:07.965 --> 39:10.931
and already you're making
such a difference.

39:13.482 --> 39:16.275
Keep this up,
and they'll be talking about you

39:16.379 --> 39:18.827
here for years to come.

39:20.206 --> 39:21.620
Well...

39:21.724 --> 39:23.551

39:23.655 --> 39:26.000

Ruby, I'm here about Griffin.

39:44.137 --> 39:46.103
Well, I ha-- I have his things.

39:46.206 --> 39:49.172
And... I knew
he'd want you to have them.

39:52.137 --> 39:54.586
Didn't charge him
when he was alive.

39:54.689 --> 39:57.310
Why would I take his money now?

39:58.206 --> 40:00.931
I knew Griffin
better than anyone.

40:01.034 --> 40:04.206
And I swear on my life,
he didn't do it.

40:04.310 --> 40:06.413
He was no angel,

40:06.517 --> 40:08.482
but Griffin never killed
anybody.

40:08.586 --> 40:11.000
Certainly not some sheriff.

40:12.379 --> 40:14.758
He didn't have it in him.

40:15.965 --> 40:18.482
But you sure did, didn't you?

40:18.586 --> 40:20.862

40:20.965 --> 40:22.689
He's got a smile
and a friendly word

40:22.793 --> 40:24.172
-for everyone.
-Okay, now. Hold on, Ruby--

Except the man you gunned down
in cold blood.

to come here

You got no heart at all.
