Augustus.

14:24.446 --> 14:27.366
Thank God. You're safe.
It's okay.

14:27.366 --> 14:29.994
Yeah, I knew he'd pull through.

14:29.994 --> 14:32.788
Just get your rest, all right?
We can talk later.

14:34.498 --> 14:35.833
We should change his dressing.

You saying Gus
tried to handcuff the sheriff?

14:47.720 --> 14:50.639
He never trusted him.

14:50.639 --> 14:52.850
That's why he went
to the Davidson ranch.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.059
What are you saying, Abby?

14:55.060 --> 14:57.021

- Yeah, of course.

Show me your handsome face.

defending my brother.

20:58.215 --> 20:59.758

looking for your pa.

22:44.780 --> 22:48.700
And, you know, after everything
that happened around here,

22:48.700 --> 22:50.702
I got to know...

22:50.702 --> 22:52.120
It's not you.

22:56.166 --> 22:57.501
Huh.

22:58.585 --> 23:00.295

23:00.295 --> 23:01.713

23:03.548 --> 23:06.676

They, uh, met back east,

23:06.676 --> 23:08.428

23:15.727 --> 23:17.396
I wasn't
sweating bullets wondering.

23:17.396 --> 23:21.358
But in the back of my brain,

23:21.358 --> 23:23.735

Do you remember

23:37.082 --> 23:39.501
when you first played it?

23:39.501 --> 23:43.505

23:46.466 --> 23:50.679
Mary Abigail McKenzie Collins.

23:54.683 --> 23:57.602
You've known who I am
the whole time, haven't you?

24:00.522 --> 24:02.691
You taught me to dream
with my eyes open.

24:10.490 --> 24:12.451

24:22.669 --> 24:26.465
At the train station,
it was left open.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.550
You were the dream to me, Abby.

24:33.096 --> 24:35.765
And I hadn't felt that way
for years.

24:37.851 --> 24:40.020
Because you reminded me
of someone.

24:40.770 --> 24:42.397
We were young.

24:42.397 --> 24:44.399
And we wanted to start a family.

24:44.816 --> 24:47.402
Tom, you should have
run away with her.

24:47.402 --> 24:49.488
You could have started
a new life. None of this...

24:49.488 --> 24:51.698
But I found you.

24:52.115 --> 24:55.494
And I had a chance
to save you instead.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.621
- You didn't.

25:00.415 --> 25:03.335

25:04.461 --> 25:06.254

25:08.089 --> 25:10.467
...if you care for me...

25:12.719 --> 25:14.763
...you'll tell me the truth.

25:18.391 --> 25:19.768
Did you kill Liam?

25:19.768 --> 25:21.436
Why does this matter?

25:22.604 --> 25:24.189
He was everything
that you detest.

25:24.189 --> 25:25.815
He was a liar,
he was corrupt, he was weak.

25:25.815 --> 25:27.567
He kept everything from you.

25:27.567 --> 25:29.361
And how is that any different
than what you've done?

25:29.361 --> 25:30.779
Because I brought you in

25:30.779 --> 25:33.198
and I gave you purpose,

25:33.198 --> 25:35.033
and we could've made
something of this place.

25:35.033 --> 25:37.702
I will make it something.

25:37.702 --> 25:40.372
Just not what you intended.

25:40.372 --> 25:43.250
First, you have to answer
for what you did.

25:46.253 --> 25:50.215
You know, your family will do
everything in their power

25:50.215 --> 25:52.551
to keep the truth
from being exposed.

25:54.135 --> 25:58.223
I can't even testify
anymore because I...

25:58.223 --> 25:59.641
Because of us.

25:59.641 --> 26:01.726
Because I doubted myself.

26:03.228 --> 26:05.063
And even if I were to testify

26:05.063 --> 26:08.275
to Liam's murder and everything
that your family has done,

26:08.275 --> 26:10.735
they would find a way
to discredit me.

26:12.404 --> 26:15.198
You could have killed me
that night.

26:16.241 --> 26:17.576
But you didn't.

26:19.786 --> 26:21.037
Why?

26:22.497 --> 26:27.210
I had been... (sighs)

...following you for days.

26:29.546 --> 26:30.797
(scoffs)

26:30.797 --> 26:32.507
And I was questioning
what to do.

26:34.801 --> 26:37.554
And what did they
tell you to do?

26:38.847 --> 26:40.181
To kill you.

26:40.181 --> 26:42.142

26:44.269 --> 26:47.397

What happened?

26:47.397 --> 26:50.650
Liam wasn't gonna make it
after the first shot.

26:52.193 --> 26:54.529
So I ended his suffering.

26:55.739 --> 26:57.449

26:57.449 --> 26:59.451
Shane wasn't close
enough to see you,

26:59.451 --> 27:03.038
so all I had to do was make it
look like I finished the job.

27:05.665 --> 27:07.250
(gasps)

27:07.250 --> 27:09.044

27:13.506 --> 27:15.550

27:20.555 --> 27:22.098

27:22.098 --> 27:24.100
To all of it?

27:26.353 --> 27:27.729
If it keeps you safe.

27:39.741 --> 27:41.951

27:41.951 --> 27:43.203

37:58.484 --> 38:00.152
You left this at the restaurant.

38:00.152 --> 38:02.571
Didn't want it to go to waste.

to survive.

38:22.675 --> 38:25.052
I should've just told you.

38:26.804 --> 38:28.723
About being a Pinkerton,
I should.

38:30.182 --> 38:32.101
I should've just told you
from the beginning.

38:33.686 --> 38:37.106
And after all this,
I'm right back at Hagan's.

38:39.525 --> 38:41.110

38:46.198 --> 38:51.412

or absence of Tom Davidson,

38:51.412 --> 38:53.289

Will you stay?

40:00.606 --> 40:02.191

40:02.191 --> 40:04.944
This is the longest
I've been in town since,

40:04.944 --> 40:07.196
well, I was a kid.

40:08.614 --> 40:10.699
Used to getting that itch,
you know?

40:10.699 --> 40:13.577
Look for some new trouble
to get into.

40:13.577 --> 40:16.205
Guess I scratched it.

40:16.205 --> 40:17.957
Or maybe you just found
something here.

40:17.957 --> 40:19.083
Funny thing is,

40:19.083 --> 40:21.627
for a few hours today...

40:23.462 --> 40:26.006
...I thought I was Matthew's pa.

40:26.006 --> 40:28.592
And, uh,

40:28.592 --> 40:31.053
I kind of didn't mind it.

40:31.053 --> 40:33.305
- Matthew's father?
- Yeah.

40:33.305 --> 40:36.350
Hoyt, that's a bit of a stretch.

40:36.350 --> 40:38.352
Well, hold on, now.

40:38.352 --> 40:40.187
The kid is 15,
so, if you do the math,

40:40.187 --> 40:43.357
that means it could be
Jocelyn in the pigpen,

40:43.357 --> 40:45.025
Annie in the cathedral,

40:45.025 --> 40:47.027
- Evelyn in the leather tannery.
- All right, I get

40:47.027 --> 40:48.320
it's physically possible.

40:48.320 --> 40:49.947
But...

40:49.947 --> 40:52.199
would you actually consider
being a father?

40:53.451 --> 40:54.952
With Lucia?

40:54.952 --> 40:56.328
I don't know about that.

40:56.328 --> 40:58.289
I mean, when we're hot,
we're hot.

40:58.289 --> 41:00.458
But when we're cold...

41:01.584 --> 41:03.502
Point is, I just--

41:03.502 --> 41:06.338
I never thought
I'd even consider it.

41:07.506 --> 41:09.633
Seems like you've
finally grown up.

41:09.633 --> 41:11.093
Oh, hell, Abby.

41:11.093 --> 41:12.470
Now I got to go in there
and get drunk,

41:12.470 --> 41:15.097
gamble, make some
really bad decisions

41:15.097 --> 41:17.475

41:26.275 --> 41:28.986
May I say,
your hair is so pretty.

41:28.986 --> 41:30.654
It reminds me of a...

41:30.654 --> 41:32.406

41:34.283 --> 41:36.076
Matthew, uh, in the future,

41:36.076 --> 41:39.079
perhaps don't refer
to the object of your affection

41:39.079 --> 41:41.248
as a rodent.

41:42.541 --> 41:44.251
Yes, ma'am.

41:44.251 --> 41:46.378
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got some poker winnings
