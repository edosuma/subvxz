Previously onYoung Sheldon...George?

00:03.742 --> 00:05.962
Roy.You work here now?

00:06.006 --> 00:08.791
Yeah, just nights and weekends
since you and the boosters

00:08.834 --> 00:10.010
are gunning for my neck.

00:10.053 --> 00:10.923
What's going on?

00:10.967 --> 00:12.316
I'm pregnant.

00:13.187 --> 00:15.015
People are talking
about Georgie.

00:16.451 --> 00:18.105
Maybe take some time off.

00:18.148 --> 00:19.671
Focus on things at home.

00:19.715 --> 00:20.846
Are you firing her?

00:20.890 --> 00:23.066
Is that really necessary?

00:23.110 --> 00:24.720
I believe it is.

00:28.506 --> 00:32.162
ADULT SHELDON:
I've heard people say fathers
are the real superheroes.

00:32.206 --> 00:33.903
My dad couldn't fly

00:33.946 --> 00:37.124
or bend steel, and you would
not want to see him in Spandex,

00:37.167 --> 00:39.039
But like Superman,

00:39.082 --> 00:42.477
he had his Fortress of Solitude.

00:44.131 --> 00:46.611
♪

00:46.655 --> 00:48.178
Can I get another?

00:49.310 --> 00:50.398
Hey, George.

00:50.441 --> 00:51.964
Great.

00:52.008 --> 00:53.749
Come on, now,
don't be like that.

00:53.792 --> 00:55.359
Let me buy you a beer.

00:55.403 --> 00:58.754
I don't need your beer and
don't act like we're friends.

00:58.797 --> 00:59.929
Just being nice.

00:59.972 --> 01:01.974
Right. You try to get me fired,

01:02.018 --> 01:03.628
and then buy me a beer,
and everything's good.

01:03.672 --> 01:04.977
George,

01:05.021 --> 01:07.067
the whole damn town knows
your team's a disaster.

01:07.110 --> 01:08.329
Is that so?

01:08.372 --> 01:09.547
Should I take a poll?

01:09.591 --> 01:12.246
You should go back
to your table.

01:12.289 --> 01:15.031
I don't want to kick a man
when he's down.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.164
Oh, I ain't down.

01:17.207 --> 01:19.470
I hate to tell you.

01:19.514 --> 01:21.777
But, yeah, you are.

01:26.216 --> 01:28.610
Yeah, you better walk away.

01:28.653 --> 01:30.220
ADULT SHELDON:
This is why the only bar

01:30.264 --> 01:33.876
I frequent is the Genius Bar
at the Apple Store.

01:33.919 --> 01:36.835

01:54.157 --> 01:56.333
What is that?

01:56.377 --> 01:57.900
A bug bite?

01:57.943 --> 02:00.859
A.V.: Hello, allow me
to introduce myself.

02:00.903 --> 02:03.384
I am Acne Vulgarus.

02:03.427 --> 02:06.213
More commonly known
as the pimple.

02:06.256 --> 02:10.565
Frankly, neither name
paints a very pretty picture,

02:10.608 --> 02:13.176
but such is the life
of a pustule.

02:13.220 --> 02:15.831
And this is
my longtime colleague,

02:15.874 --> 02:18.138
Pus. Now, we're usually

02:18.181 --> 02:21.445
associated with, uh,
ugliness and discomfort,

02:21.489 --> 02:23.012
but I would argue

02:23.055 --> 02:25.623
we're actually
a symbol of growth.

02:25.667 --> 02:28.017
In this case,
Sheldon Cooper's ascent--

02:28.060 --> 02:30.628
or descent-- into adulthood.

02:30.672 --> 02:32.761
Kind of a signpost that says,

02:32.804 --> 02:35.329
"You are now entering puberty."

02:35.372 --> 02:37.679
Yeah, like that.

02:37.722 --> 02:39.463
Doesn't look like a bug bite.

02:39.507 --> 02:40.769
It's probably a pimple.

02:40.812 --> 02:42.423
It's not, I don't get those.

02:42.466 --> 02:44.990
As you might expect,
we pimples are not

02:45.034 --> 02:47.254
very fond of popping things,

02:47.297 --> 02:49.386
but I was about to burst

02:49.430 --> 02:51.040
this young man's bubble.

02:52.084 --> 02:54.304
Oh, yeah, that's a zit.

02:54.348 --> 02:56.959
No, it's not.
My hygiene is impeccable.Zit.

02:57.002 --> 02:59.527
Everybody gets 'em
sooner or later, baby.

02:59.570 --> 03:01.877
I'm not everybody.

03:02.921 --> 03:05.359
No one is ever happy to see me.

03:05.402 --> 03:09.319
My therapist says that's
their problem, not mine.

03:09.363 --> 03:11.321
But, honestly,

03:11.365 --> 03:13.715
it hurts.

03:14.629 --> 03:16.021
Pus?

03:16.065 --> 03:18.850
This is supposed
to be a safe space.

03:23.812 --> 03:25.335
So I ran into Roy last night.

03:25.379 --> 03:26.467
Okay.

03:26.510 --> 03:28.033
Sounds like I'm done here.

03:28.077 --> 03:29.905
He said that?Basically.

03:29.948 --> 03:32.386
[sighs] It's probably
that coach from Carthage.

03:32.429 --> 03:34.388
Actually...

03:34.431 --> 03:36.781
it's not.

03:38.130 --> 03:39.654
What's going on?

03:40.872 --> 03:42.222
I got offered the job.

03:42.265 --> 03:42.961
Wayne.

03:43.005 --> 03:44.267
I-I didn't answer yet.

03:44.311 --> 03:45.877
I wanted to talk it over
with you first.

03:45.921 --> 03:47.705
What's to talk about?
You want it, right?

03:47.749 --> 03:49.359
Well, yeah, but...

03:49.403 --> 03:50.708
but not behind your back.

03:50.752 --> 03:53.058
I'll make it easy for you.

03:54.146 --> 03:57.193
That did not make it easier.

03:58.412 --> 04:00.544
Morning, George.

04:00.588 --> 04:01.719
I know what's going on.

04:01.763 --> 04:03.721
I'm sorry.

04:03.765 --> 04:05.810
I did everything I could.

04:05.854 --> 04:08.204
You know I'm on your side.Yeah, right.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.424
We still want you
to finish out the year.

04:10.467 --> 04:12.077
I'm not doing that. I quit.

04:12.121 --> 04:13.470
Come on, George.

04:13.514 --> 04:15.255
Is there a chance I keep my job?

04:17.039 --> 04:18.867
No.

04:20.129 --> 04:22.958
Then at least let me leave
on my own terms.

04:23.785 --> 04:25.874
All right.

04:30.400 --> 04:33.011
I'll take a beer.

04:33.795 --> 04:35.144
Celebrating a win?

04:35.187 --> 04:38.278
No, I've been losing
all morning.

04:38.321 --> 04:40.236
Couple more of them,
you won't give a crap.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.760
Let's hope.

04:43.500 --> 04:45.285
What the hell are you doing?

04:45.328 --> 04:46.634
Making extra money.

04:46.677 --> 04:47.896
Are you crazy?

04:47.939 --> 04:49.245
You're gonna
get us all arrested.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.160
You're paying off the cops,
ain't you?

04:51.203 --> 04:53.293
For gambling.
You start selling liquor

04:53.336 --> 04:55.773
without a license,
you're asking for trouble.

04:55.817 --> 04:57.601
I'm having a baby. I need cash.

04:57.645 --> 04:59.429
Well, think of something else.

04:59.473 --> 05:01.301
Well, can I have a raise?

05:01.344 --> 05:04.869
Are you selling that
or drinking it?

05:05.870 --> 05:07.437
Give me that.

05:07.481 --> 05:08.612
Hey.

05:08.656 --> 05:11.093
How is this empty already?

05:11.136 --> 05:12.660
It was my lunch.

05:13.617 --> 05:15.315
This is...

05:15.358 --> 05:16.751
just a pimple.

05:16.794 --> 05:18.535
Well, how can you be sure
it isn't chicken pox?

05:18.579 --> 05:20.320
Or small pox? Or monkey pox,

05:20.363 --> 05:22.626
which I know sounds made-up,
but is very real.

05:22.670 --> 05:24.585
Have you been near any monkeys?

05:24.628 --> 05:25.586
No.

05:25.629 --> 05:26.761
Try benzoyl peroxide.

05:26.804 --> 05:28.240
It's over the counter.

05:28.284 --> 05:30.547
Oh, no, not...

05:30.591 --> 05:32.332
benzoyl peroxide.

05:32.375 --> 05:33.463
[high-pitched]: I'm melting!

05:33.507 --> 05:35.204
I'm melting!

05:35.247 --> 05:37.859
Give me a break.

05:37.902 --> 05:39.556
But a pimple is a sign
of puberty, and I'm

05:39.600 --> 05:42.254
showing no other indicators.
No armpit or chest hair,

05:42.298 --> 05:44.256
and I have so little interest
in the opposite sex,

05:44.300 --> 05:45.867
I barely noticed you're a woman.

05:45.910 --> 05:47.347
Thank you.

05:53.004 --> 05:54.876
What are you doing home?

05:54.919 --> 05:55.877
I quit my job.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.269
What? Why?

05:57.313 --> 05:58.662
The school offered it to Wayne.

05:58.706 --> 05:59.533
I wasn't gonna sit around
waiting to get fired.

05:59.576 --> 06:01.752
Oh.

06:03.537 --> 06:05.016
You doing okay?

06:05.060 --> 06:08.193
No, Mary, not really.

06:08.237 --> 06:10.326
We're standing here
without jobs in a house

06:10.370 --> 06:11.806
we're not done paying for.

06:11.849 --> 06:14.635
Well, you're still working
at Ballard's, right?

06:14.678 --> 06:16.419
That ain't gonna cover
the mortgage.

06:17.551 --> 06:20.118
We've been through
tough spots before.

06:20.162 --> 06:21.685
We'll figure it out and...

06:21.729 --> 06:22.991
I know you don't want

06:23.034 --> 06:25.602
to hear it, but I've been
praying on this...

06:25.646 --> 06:28.388
You're right.
I don't want to hear it.

06:32.957 --> 06:34.916
[knocking]SHELDON: Dr. Linkletter,

06:34.959 --> 06:36.047
may I speak with you?

06:36.091 --> 06:37.919
If I say no, will you leave?

06:37.962 --> 06:38.789
No.

06:38.833 --> 06:40.182
Then why even ask?

06:40.225 --> 06:42.053
It's called manners.

06:42.097 --> 06:43.490
What do you want?

06:44.404 --> 06:46.928
I was hoping
we could discuss puberty.

06:46.971 --> 06:48.930
Then allow me
to dash your hopes. No.

06:48.973 --> 06:51.193
But I think I may be entering
it, and I would like to talk

06:51.236 --> 06:53.282
about it,
man-to-blossoming-young-man.

06:53.325 --> 06:55.153
Wouldn't you rather
talk to your father

06:55.197 --> 06:58.156
or a schoolmate
or literally anyone else?

06:58.200 --> 06:59.462
But you went through it once.

06:59.506 --> 07:01.159
Sure, it was
a long, long time ago,

07:01.203 --> 07:03.466
but I'm assuming
the basics haven't changed.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.163
Hold that thought.

07:05.207 --> 07:08.384
Okay, so, what's the problem?

07:08.428 --> 07:10.473
I wanted to talk with
Dr. Linkletter about puberty.

07:10.517 --> 07:12.257
And I wanted
to avoid litigation.

07:22.920 --> 07:24.879
Hey, if we can't

07:24.922 --> 07:26.489
sell beer,
what about cigarettes?

07:26.533 --> 07:28.839
We could make money
and keep people

07:28.883 --> 07:30.145
from leaving to go buy more.

07:30.188 --> 07:31.973
That's not a bad idea.

07:32.016 --> 07:34.018
I could go down to Walmart,
buy some cartons.

07:34.062 --> 07:36.368
We could mark 'em up like crazy.Mm-hmm.

07:36.412 --> 07:38.153
Reminds me of when I was young

07:38.196 --> 07:39.763
and we used to go down
across the border

07:39.807 --> 07:41.373
and get 'em cheap in Mexico.

07:41.417 --> 07:42.505
How cheap?

07:42.549 --> 07:44.464
Well, between
the taxes and the peso,

07:44.507 --> 07:46.466
practically nothing.
[chuckles]

07:46.509 --> 07:47.858
Let's do that.

07:47.902 --> 07:49.730
I'm not driving to Mexico.

07:49.773 --> 07:51.427
I don't need you. I'll go.

07:52.167 --> 07:53.255
Where do I go?

07:53.298 --> 07:55.126
I'm not telling you.Why?

07:55.170 --> 07:56.519
'Cause you're dumb
in this country.

07:56.563 --> 07:58.303
God knows what you are
anywhere else.

07:59.130 --> 08:00.697
Fine.
I'll just head south

08:00.741 --> 08:02.177
and see where it takes me.

08:02.220 --> 08:04.788
I'm impressed
you knew it was south.

08:04.832 --> 08:07.487
But what if it's scratchy
and it's all I can think about?

08:07.530 --> 08:09.140
It's just armpit hair.

08:09.184 --> 08:10.359
Well, I don't even have it yet

08:10.402 --> 08:11.839
and it's already
consuming my thoughts.

08:11.882 --> 08:13.449
All right, Sheldon,
you are a smart kid.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.930
Now, you had to know that this
was gonna happen eventually.

08:15.973 --> 08:18.672
I'm a smart kid now,
but what will I be in a year?

08:18.715 --> 08:19.934
A smart young man.

08:19.977 --> 08:21.283
And then a smart adult.

08:21.326 --> 08:23.024
With money problems
and marital strife

08:23.067 --> 08:25.940
and every other problem
you can think of.

08:27.332 --> 08:28.769
I'll probably have a beer belly.

08:28.812 --> 08:30.074
Or root beer belly.

08:30.118 --> 08:31.946
All right, now, Sheldon...
[chuckles]

08:31.989 --> 08:34.731
being a grown-up
isn't all bad, right?

08:34.775 --> 08:35.776
Eh.

08:35.819 --> 08:37.168
I mean, yeah, sure, your...

08:37.212 --> 08:39.040
you know, your body starts
to fall apart.

08:39.083 --> 08:40.868
But there

08:40.911 --> 08:42.565
is a window

08:42.609 --> 08:44.872
at about, mm, 22

08:44.915 --> 08:47.439
where everything's just...
mwah.

08:47.483 --> 08:48.615
Oh, when I was 22,

08:48.658 --> 08:50.442
I was a strapping
blonde oak of a man.

08:50.486 --> 08:53.707
I'd walk down the street,
you could hear the knees buckle.

08:53.750 --> 08:55.360
If I could go back,

08:55.404 --> 08:58.842
I would wear
nothing but a bikini, 24-7.

08:58.886 --> 09:00.583
My mind was a steel trap.

09:00.627 --> 09:02.803
I could rattle off pi
to 25 places.

09:02.846 --> 09:04.587
Today...

09:04.631 --> 09:06.415
not sure where I parked.

09:06.458 --> 09:08.504
I once went to France
for a month

09:08.548 --> 09:10.767
with a man I met
in the airport bar.

09:10.811 --> 09:12.203
[sighs]

09:12.247 --> 09:14.510
Missed my grandmother's
funeral, but...

09:14.554 --> 09:15.946

18:54.916 --> 18:56.135
We got arrested.

18:56.178 --> 18:58.615
What?Who is it?

19:03.490 --> 19:04.839
ADULT SHELDON:
My sister encouraged me

19:04.882 --> 19:06.232
to embrace adolescence

19:06.275 --> 19:09.235
as a journey
of scientific discovery.

19:09.278 --> 19:13.021
I stood before a whole new
teenage world of music,

19:13.064 --> 19:16.111
slang words
and even clothing styles.

19:17.939 --> 19:20.071
Pretty groovy, huh?

19:24.772 --> 19:26.600
Wow, I might look too cool.
