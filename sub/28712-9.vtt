WEBVTT

00:01.340 --> 00:06.970
Meteors, bombarding the Earth from space.

00:07.090 --> 00:09.090
Material from other bodies
in our solar system

00:09.220 --> 00:12.850
is continually raining down
on the planet Earth.

00:12.970 --> 00:14.890
NARRATOR:
And with that are billions

00:15.020 --> 00:17.810
of microscopic alien life-forms.

00:19.230 --> 00:21.900
800 million viruses

00:22.020 --> 00:23.570
are falling from the skies

00:23.690 --> 00:26.240
every single day.

00:26.360 --> 00:29.280
NARRATOR:
Is our planet properly prepared

00:29.410 --> 00:32.910
for an extraterrestrial
invasion... of disease?

00:33.040 --> 00:34.750
BILL BIRNES:
What if the terrible plagues

00:34.870 --> 00:37.330
that ravaged the Earth
were the result

00:37.460 --> 00:39.420
of alien viruses

00:39.540 --> 00:42.380
that are constantly
bombarding the planet?

00:42.500 --> 00:44.880
NARRATOR:
But are these alien viruses

00:45.010 --> 00:48.340
meant to harm us...
or change us

00:48.470 --> 00:51.430
in ways we can hardly imagine?

00:51.550 --> 00:53.510
ANDREW COLLINS:
Sometimes, viruses help

00:53.640 --> 00:55.640
human evolution.

00:55.770 --> 00:57.520
GIORGIO A. TSOUKALOS:
It is a deliberate

00:57.640 --> 01:00.770
artificial change of our DNA.

01:04.019 --> 01:06.150
NARRATOR:
There is a doorway

01:06.280 --> 01:08.570
in the universe.

01:08.700 --> 01:12.620
Beyond it is
the promise of truth.

01:12.740 --> 01:15.540
It demands
we question everything

01:15.660 --> 01:18.120
we have ever been taught.

01:18.250 --> 01:21.580
The evidence is all around us.

01:21.710 --> 01:25.340
The future is
right before our eyes.

01:25.460 --> 01:27.840
We are not alone.

01:27.970 --> 01:31.260
We have never <i>been alone.</i>

01:44.730 --> 01:46.780
NARRATOR:
A Stanford University study

01:46.900 --> 01:49.150
published in the journal <i>eLife,</i>

01:49.280 --> 01:52.360
reveals a remarkable finding
that dramatically changes

01:52.490 --> 01:56.200
our understanding
of human evolution.

01:56.330 --> 02:00.960
The study reports that since
modern humans first emerged

02:01.080 --> 02:04.040
from earlier primates,
roughly one third

02:04.170 --> 02:06.840
of their evolutionary
adaptations have been caused

02:06.960 --> 02:10.880
not by means of natural
selection, but by viruses.

02:12.970 --> 02:14.510
KIRSTEN FISHER:
We have genes in our own genome

02:14.640 --> 02:17.350
that were derived
from a retrovirus

02:17.470 --> 02:18.850
at some point in our history.

02:20.600 --> 02:22.850
And some actually have
important functions

02:22.980 --> 02:25.190
for our development as humans.

02:25.310 --> 02:28.570
This suggests that
there has been some kind

02:28.690 --> 02:32.740
of symbiotic relationship
with viruses

02:32.860 --> 02:36.240
since the beginning
of life itself.

02:36.370 --> 02:42.330
Sometimes, viruses
help human evolution.

02:42.460 --> 02:44.630
NARRATOR:
According to another study,

02:44.750 --> 02:47.920
one important human adaptation
that resulted from a virus

02:48.050 --> 02:50.710
is a special layer
of the human placenta

02:50.840 --> 02:53.010
that prevents the fetus
from being rejected

02:53.130 --> 02:55.720
by the mother's body.

02:55.840 --> 02:59.930
The genes that create this
tissue are called syncytins

03:00.060 --> 03:03.190
and they were not originally
found in human ancestors.

03:04.940 --> 03:06.440
FISHER:
They were acquired at

03:06.560 --> 03:08.400
a couple different points
in our history,

03:08.520 --> 03:10.190
about 25 and 40 million
years ago.

03:10.320 --> 03:12.400
And they're important
for the connection

03:12.530 --> 03:14.490
between the mother
and the fetus.

03:16.240 --> 03:18.160
NARRATOR:
Some scientists now believe

03:18.280 --> 03:21.540
that viral genes like this
were as important

03:21.660 --> 03:24.330
for human evolution
as natural selection.

03:24.460 --> 03:27.880
HOOVER: I think
that horizontal gene transfer

03:28.000 --> 03:30.840
being carried out
by viruses or phages

03:30.960 --> 03:36.300
was probably the primary
mechanism whereby changes

03:36.430 --> 03:41.060
in species and major changes
within a species occurred.

03:41.180 --> 03:43.480
NARRATOR:
Was it by pure chance

03:43.600 --> 03:45.730
that viruses helped
to create a species

03:45.850 --> 03:48.110
as sophisticated as humans?

03:48.230 --> 03:51.860
Or might this viral evolution
have been intelligently

03:51.980 --> 03:56.950
directed by beings
from outer space?

03:57.070 --> 04:01.660
Anthropologists are telling us that humans evolved
Anthropologists are telling us that humans evolved

04:01.790 --> 04:05.660
over time out of Africa
and that we had certain,

04:05.790 --> 04:07.710
uh, genetic leaps...

04:11.550 --> 04:15.670
uh, became greater
and so these genetic leaps

04:15.800 --> 04:19.640
throughout evolutionary history
might have just been

04:19.760 --> 04:24.100
a natural thing, but they could
have been engineered as well.

04:24.220 --> 04:26.890
TSOUKALOS:
There is no doubt in my mind

04:27.020 --> 04:31.360
that viruses that have
originated from space

04:31.480 --> 04:35.570
somehow had to do with our
development here on Earth.

04:35.690 --> 04:38.700
However, it is very clear

04:38.820 --> 04:41.700
that the ancient astronaut
theory proposes

04:41.830 --> 04:45.870
that the one reason
why we became humans

04:46.000 --> 04:49.460
as we are today
is not due to an accident

04:49.580 --> 04:52.420
by some natural virus
from outer space,

04:52.540 --> 04:57.630
but a deliberate, artificial
change of our DNA.

04:57.760 --> 05:00.890
NARRATOR:
Could humans be the subject

05:01.010 --> 05:04.260
of a bioengineering project
by extraterrestrials

05:04.390 --> 05:08.440
who use viruses from space
to alter our evolution?

05:08.560 --> 05:11.690
And if so, could those viruses

05:11.810 --> 05:13.570
have been delivered
to Earth in comets?

05:13.690 --> 05:19.110
Ancient astronaut theorists
point to a curious event

05:19.240 --> 05:21.570
in our evolutionary history:

05:21.700 --> 05:24.790
The moment humans
almost went extinct.

05:26.700 --> 05:32.330
Around 75,000 years ago,
there was a bottleneck

05:32.460 --> 05:34.210
in human evolution.

05:36.050 --> 05:39.470
It's suggested
that the human population

05:39.590 --> 05:43.430
actually went down from millions

05:43.550 --> 05:46.470
down to just a few thousand.

05:46.600 --> 05:50.850
This is certainly something
that genetics backs up.

05:50.980 --> 05:55.480
And we have to ask ourselves
what was going on at this time.

05:55.610 --> 05:59.400
PHILIP IMBROGNO: Originally,
geologists believed that

05:59.530 --> 06:02.240
that bottleneck
of humanity was caused

06:02.360 --> 06:05.780
by the supervolcano in,
uh, Sumatra exploding.

06:05.910 --> 06:10.910
Now, recent finds have indicated
that's not the case

06:11.040 --> 06:13.420
and they're leaning more towards

06:13.540 --> 06:17.920
a virus, a plague,
that was genetically

06:18.050 --> 06:19.300
programmed for early humans.

06:19.420 --> 06:22.340
Wiped them out.

06:22.470 --> 06:25.140
NARRATOR:
One controversial theory

06:25.260 --> 06:27.720
is that the cause
of this bottleneck event

06:27.850 --> 06:30.270
was not just a virus,
but a virus

06:30.390 --> 06:34.400
that was brought to Earth
on a comet.

06:34.520 --> 06:38.030
According to this theory,
a comet slammed into the planet

06:38.150 --> 06:41.030
with such devastating force,
that it created

06:41.150 --> 06:43.280
a nuclear winter...

06:43.410 --> 06:47.450
killing almost all
human life on Earth.

06:47.580 --> 06:50.450
Almost. Because those
that could survive

06:50.580 --> 06:53.420
both the nuclear winter
and the alien virus

06:53.540 --> 06:58.050
emerged as a profoundly altered
and improved species.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.340
It was immediately
following this event

07:02.470 --> 07:04.930
that humans first began
to leave evidence

07:05.050 --> 07:09.390
of symbolic thinking, art, music
and advanced language.

07:09.510 --> 07:12.020
Somehow, human beings

07:12.140 --> 07:15.060
reached another stage
of evolution.

07:15.190 --> 07:20.030
It was the transformation
of the human brain.

07:20.150 --> 07:24.530
Could it be,
and we believe it did happen,

07:24.660 --> 07:28.370
that alien viruses infected
Planet Earth

07:28.490 --> 07:30.330
at this inflection point

07:30.450 --> 07:33.120
of the extinction
of the human species.

07:33.250 --> 07:36.790
They implanted viruses
in the human species

07:36.920 --> 07:39.340
that changed the brain.

07:39.460 --> 07:42.510
NARRATOR:
But could viruses really survive

07:42.630 --> 07:45.470
in the frozen vacuum of space?

07:45.590 --> 07:48.180
And if so, could they
have come here

07:48.300 --> 07:50.680
not by accident,
but as some kind

07:50.810 --> 07:53.230
of extraterrestrial invasion?

07:55.060 --> 07:58.560
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes and suggest

07:58.690 --> 08:01.900
further clues might be found
by examining a controversial

08:02.030 --> 08:05.530
theory that comets,
far from being lifeless,

08:05.650 --> 08:09.160
are brimming with alien microbes

08:09.280 --> 08:12.040
and they are headed our way.

08:20.630 --> 08:22.300
NARRATOR:
Boston, Massachusetts.

08:22.420 --> 08:26.220
August 27, 1918.

08:26.340 --> 08:30.010
Two sailors visit the sick bay
at a seaside pier

08:30.140 --> 08:32.059
with frightening symptoms.

08:32.179 --> 08:35.980
Their bodies are literally
covered with dark splotches,

08:36.100 --> 08:38.900
they suffer from severe bleeding

08:39.020 --> 08:41.440
and they are foaming
at the mouth.

08:41.570 --> 08:47.240
The next day, eight more arrive
with the same symptoms.

08:47.360 --> 08:51.950
And, in just a few weeks,
thousands die,

08:52.080 --> 08:55.950
as Boston falls into the grip
of one of the deadliest

08:56.080 --> 09:00.540
viral outbreaks of all time,
the Spanish flu.

09:00.670 --> 09:03.500
FISHER:
The 1918 Spanish flu epidemic

09:03.630 --> 09:08.010
is probably the worst epidemic
in recorded human history.

09:09.550 --> 09:10.840
Medical historians estimate

09:10.970 --> 09:12.300
that up to 20 million

09:12.430 --> 09:14.720
people, uh, died
during that epidemic.

09:14.850 --> 09:16.980
BIRNES:
It didn't just focus

09:17.100 --> 09:19.140
on one group of people.

09:19.270 --> 09:22.020
People from the very top
echelon of society

09:22.150 --> 09:24.360
all the way to the working poor

09:24.480 --> 09:27.150
were struck down
by the Spanish flu.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.870
NARRATOR:
Half a world away, the same

09:33.990 --> 09:37.830
influenza epidemic ravages
populations across India.

09:37.950 --> 09:42.210
Its starting point is traced
back to the city of Bombay.

09:42.330 --> 09:46.590
And there's a strange connection
between these two outbreaks:

09:46.710 --> 09:51.010
They began on the same day.

09:51.130 --> 09:53.760
One of the things that's not
often discussed

09:53.890 --> 09:56.430
is that the great flu
epidemic began

09:56.560 --> 09:59.600
on the same day
in two different places:

09:59.730 --> 10:04.440
In Boston and on the other side
of the world in Bombay.

10:04.560 --> 10:06.480
Now, those are
two spots on the Earth

10:06.610 --> 10:08.530
that are virtually
on opposite ends

10:08.650 --> 10:11.950
and you have to wonder
how that is possible because

10:12.070 --> 10:17.700
you can't travel, within a day,
by ship from Boston to India.

10:17.830 --> 10:20.830
And air travel, at the time,
didn't exist.

10:20.960 --> 10:23.500
IMBROGNO:
How does an outbreak occur

10:23.630 --> 10:26.340
of the same virus on places

10:26.460 --> 10:29.260
so spread apart

10:29.380 --> 10:33.340
in 1918 in less than 24 hours?

10:33.470 --> 10:39.390
The answer is that the virus
probably fell from space.

10:39.520 --> 10:45.020
Perhaps the Earth was grazed
by the tail of a comet...

10:47.190 --> 10:50.490
and so that's why we had
the outbreak of the epidemic

10:50.610 --> 10:52.610
on two sides of the planet.

10:54.240 --> 10:56.160
NARRATOR:
Until recently,

10:56.280 --> 11:00.000
it was believed that radiation,
extreme temperatures

11:00.120 --> 11:02.080
and the vacuum of space...

11:02.210 --> 11:04.620
That is to say,
the absence of any oxygen...

11:04.750 --> 11:08.040
Would kill any life-form.

11:08.170 --> 11:10.010
- ASTRONAUT: Pressurization, go Atlas.
- ASTRONAUT 2: Go Centaur.

11:10.130 --> 11:13.010
NARRATOR: But ever since humans
first ventured into space,

11:13.130 --> 11:17.760
scientists have been finding
evidence to the contrary.

11:26.350 --> 11:28.320
NASA's unmanned
<i>Surveyor 3 lander</i>

11:28.440 --> 11:31.400
touches down on the Moon

11:31.530 --> 11:33.780
and begins its mission
collecting soil

11:33.900 --> 11:36.570
from the lunar surface.

11:36.700 --> 11:39.200
Two years later,

11:39.330 --> 11:41.700
astronauts
on the Apollo 12 mission

11:41.830 --> 11:46.500
recover parts of <i>Surveyor 3
and return them to Earth.</i>

11:46.630 --> 11:50.250
To the astonishment
of scientists,

11:50.380 --> 11:54.220
living strep bacteria
is found on the probe.

11:54.340 --> 11:58.890
But this is only the first
of many cases of microorganisms

11:59.010 --> 12:01.260
surviving space travel.

12:03.850 --> 12:05.140
HOOVER:
There have been experiments

12:05.270 --> 12:08.100
in which microorganisms
have been flown

12:08.230 --> 12:10.270
to the International
Space Station

12:10.400 --> 12:13.940
and exposed to the hard vacuum
and the radiation

12:14.070 --> 12:16.950
and the temperature changes
of deep space.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.320
And many
of those organisms survived.

12:20.870 --> 12:22.870
NARRATOR:
Incredibly,

12:22.990 --> 12:26.120
several types of bacteria
have thrived back on Earth

12:26.250 --> 12:28.290
after spending up to two years

12:28.420 --> 12:31.210
outside
the International Space Station.

12:31.340 --> 12:35.470
But even more surprisingly,
this durability isn't reserved

12:35.590 --> 12:38.340
for single-celled organisms
alone.

12:38.470 --> 12:43.350
In September 2007,
a Russian Soyuz rocket

12:43.470 --> 12:46.980
carried tiny animals
called tardigrades into space

12:47.100 --> 12:48.650
to test their legendary ability

12:48.770 --> 12:52.730
to thrive
in extreme environments.

12:52.860 --> 12:55.190
HOOVER: Tardigrades
are called water bears.

12:55.320 --> 12:59.200
Uh, they're found in the polar
regions on mosses and so forth,

12:59.320 --> 13:01.200
and they're beautiful
little animals.

13:01.320 --> 13:04.740
They have a very unusual
life history,

13:04.870 --> 13:07.830
and there were experiments in
which tardigrades were carried

13:07.960 --> 13:09.870
to the International
Space Station,

13:10.000 --> 13:12.630
and they were found
to survive exposure

13:12.750 --> 13:15.050
to the deep space environment.

13:15.170 --> 13:17.220
And after they were
brought back,

13:17.340 --> 13:18.930
there were several
of the tardigrades

13:19.050 --> 13:21.930
that were still alive.

13:22.050 --> 13:26.930
Now, in the last 20 years,
it was shown beyond any doubt

13:27.060 --> 13:30.600
that microbes are essentially
born space travelers.

13:30.730 --> 13:34.980
They can survive almost any of
the rigors that you can think of

13:35.110 --> 13:36.940
that would greet them in space.

13:37.070 --> 13:38.400
High temperatures,

13:38.530 --> 13:40.490
high radiation,

13:40.610 --> 13:41.990
intense cooling

13:42.120 --> 13:44.780
and even intense heating.

13:44.910 --> 13:48.750
It's also well established
that microorganisms can

13:48.870 --> 13:52.630
very easily survive
in bodies like comets

13:52.750 --> 13:57.420
and could well live in bodies
like Europa and Enceladus

13:57.550 --> 14:02.010
because there is ice there,
there is liquid water oceans

14:02.140 --> 14:05.350
underneath the icy crust.

14:05.470 --> 14:08.350
NARRATOR: In recent years,
astronomers are identifying

14:08.480 --> 14:12.690
more and more planets that could
potentially harbor life.

14:12.810 --> 14:15.820
Some believe that microbial life

14:15.940 --> 14:18.940
first evolved on one
of these distant planets.

14:21.400 --> 14:25.870
Eons later, meteor impacts
blasted some of them into space,

14:25.990 --> 14:29.000
where they took root in comets.

14:29.120 --> 14:30.750
But even if true,

14:30.870 --> 14:33.830
how could they descend to Earth
and infect humans?

14:33.960 --> 14:37.670
HOOVER: We know for a fact
that material from other bodies

14:37.800 --> 14:41.260
in our solar system
is continually raining down

14:41.380 --> 14:43.340
on the surface
of the planet Earth,

14:43.470 --> 14:46.550
and it could well be
bringing with it dead

14:46.680 --> 14:49.810
and possibly even living
microorganisms

14:49.930 --> 14:53.310
as it enters the Earth's
atmosphere and then lands

14:53.440 --> 14:56.690
in oceans or lakes
or streams of the planet.

14:56.820 --> 14:59.980
NARRATOR: Could this
explain many of the plagues

15:00.110 --> 15:02.950
that sickened and killed
millions throughout history?

15:03.070 --> 15:08.330
In 2007, an international team
of researchers set up

15:08.450 --> 15:12.160
a research facility in the
Sierra Nevada mountains of Spain

15:12.290 --> 15:15.960
to collect data on microbes
falling to Earth from the sky.

15:16.080 --> 15:20.300
What they discovered
remains controversial.

15:20.420 --> 15:23.260
The total amount of viruses

15:23.380 --> 15:26.470
that were falling down
on the Earth

15:26.590 --> 15:31.720
was something like
800 million individual viruses

15:31.850 --> 15:35.190
per square meter of the Earth.

15:35.310 --> 15:37.150
The conclusion they came to,
of course, was that

15:37.270 --> 15:40.280
this was essentially viruses
that were lofted

15:40.400 --> 15:42.490
from the surface of the Earth,

15:42.610 --> 15:46.030
taken up to the clouds
and brought back.

15:46.160 --> 15:50.370
Now, I think some would have
been recirculated in this way,

15:50.490 --> 15:52.410
but not all,

15:52.540 --> 15:55.540
and I feel that this is

15:55.670 --> 16:00.710
one of the most striking
examples of science

16:00.840 --> 16:05.680
being essentially dishonest
in its conclusions.

16:05.800 --> 16:10.890
These 800 million viruses
per square meter

16:11.010 --> 16:15.020
falling on the Earth
must include viruses

16:15.140 --> 16:17.190
that are coming from outside.

16:19.770 --> 16:21.690
NARRATOR:
Although some scientists believe

16:21.820 --> 16:24.110
that life on Earth
actually originated

16:24.240 --> 16:28.110
with microbes
that rained down from comets,

16:28.240 --> 16:31.080
a theory known as panspermia,

16:31.200 --> 16:33.370
an even more
controversial theory

16:33.500 --> 16:35.830
called directed panspermia

16:35.960 --> 16:41.290
proposes that these comets
were sent here not by accident,

16:41.420 --> 16:44.010
but deliberately.

16:45.260 --> 16:48.470
If I'm an alien species,

16:48.590 --> 16:52.640
and I want to start a colony
on a different planet,

16:52.760 --> 16:54.600
think of what we're doing now.

16:54.720 --> 16:59.600
We want to send human beings
back to the Moon.

16:59.730 --> 17:02.770
We want to send
human beings to Mars.

17:02.900 --> 17:05.690
What if that's not
what they did?

17:05.819 --> 17:11.660
What if the ancient aliens
didn't send complete life-forms,

17:11.780 --> 17:17.290
but sent
submicroscopic life-forms?

17:17.410 --> 17:20.670
NARRATOR: Mainstream
scientists remain skeptical

17:20.790 --> 17:23.670
that microbes can survive
for thousands of years

17:23.800 --> 17:28.880
inside icy comets, much less
that they might be sent to Earth

17:29.010 --> 17:31.590
deliberately
to alter human evolution.

17:33.350 --> 17:35.390
But others argue that the proof

17:35.520 --> 17:37.810
can be found
right here on Earth,

17:37.930 --> 17:40.850
in the closest environment
we have to comets:

17:40.980 --> 17:44.520
The icy depths of glaciers.

17:51.030 --> 17:55.120
TSOUKALOS:
April 17, 2019..

17:55.240 --> 17:59.040
Ancient astronaut theorist
Giorgio Tsoukalos

17:59.160 --> 18:02.420
and retired NASA scientist
Dr. Richard Hoover

18:02.540 --> 18:05.710
are about to board a helicopter
bound for a massive ice cave

18:05.840 --> 18:07.300
in the Canadian wilderness.

18:07.420 --> 18:08.880
All right, you ready for this?

18:09.010 --> 18:11.180
- Yes, absolutely.
- All right.

18:11.300 --> 18:14.970
NARRATOR: Dr. Hoover spent most
of his career studying fossils

18:15.100 --> 18:18.350
for signs of extraterrestrial
microscopic life,

18:18.470 --> 18:21.190
and is a leading proponent
of panspermia,

18:21.310 --> 18:24.480
the idea that life on Earth
originally rained down

18:24.610 --> 18:26.690
from comets in outer space.

18:30.110 --> 18:32.240
He has invited Giorgio
to accompany him

18:32.360 --> 18:34.530
while he investigates
the Whistler ice cave...

18:34.660 --> 18:36.330
I always love this.

18:36.450 --> 18:38.160
NARRATOR: Where he is
confident they will find

18:38.290 --> 18:40.160
the glacial ice
teeming with microbial

18:40.290 --> 18:44.670
and perhaps even more
sophisticated life-forms.

18:44.790 --> 18:48.000
Life-forms that may be
thousands of years old.

18:48.130 --> 18:50.010
HOOVER:
Oh, this is just...

18:50.130 --> 18:53.180
- absolutely magnificent.
- It really is.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.470
NARRATOR: If alien viruses
are reaching Earth,

18:55.600 --> 18:58.970
Dr. Hoover suggests that those
that don't find a host

18:59.100 --> 19:01.480
could survive
within such an environment

19:01.600 --> 19:04.270
for long periods of time.

19:04.400 --> 19:05.980
Today, he'll examine the glacier

19:06.110 --> 19:09.900
for the perfect samples
to analyze in his laboratory.

19:10.030 --> 19:12.320
So, Richard,
how excited are you to be here

19:12.450 --> 19:14.410
to conduct this experiment?

19:14.530 --> 19:16.660
(chuckles):
Well, I'm tremendously excited.

19:16.780 --> 19:20.160
- This-this is absolutely a-a marvelous opportunity...
- Yeah.

19:20.290 --> 19:23.080
To do more studies
of life in ice.

19:23.210 --> 19:26.960
NARRATOR: After a 20-minute
helicopter ride, the team arrives

19:27.090 --> 19:30.130
at the Whistler ice cave
in the Pemberton glacier.

19:31.760 --> 19:33.590
TSOUKALOS:
Wow.

19:33.720 --> 19:37.390
- This is incredible.
- HOOVER: Yeah, amazing.

19:38.600 --> 19:40.310
HOOVER:
Look at that.

19:40.430 --> 19:43.770
There must be a thousand shades
of blue in this ice cave.

19:43.890 --> 19:45.940
Just absolutely fantastic.

19:48.230 --> 19:51.690
And here we see all of these
magnificent shades of blue,

19:51.820 --> 19:55.150
and up there you see
big streaks of black.

19:55.280 --> 19:58.780
Glaciers like to eat rocks,
and as they eat rocks,

19:58.910 --> 20:02.370
the rocks gather inside,
and when the sun shines

20:02.500 --> 20:04.290
through the ice
and hits the rocks,

20:04.410 --> 20:08.080
it can cause it to melt and form
nice little pools of water,

20:08.210 --> 20:11.710
and then when bacteria
and algae grow in there

20:11.840 --> 20:15.590
and respire and produce their...
their photosynthetic products,

20:15.720 --> 20:17.010
they make their own atmosphere.

20:17.140 --> 20:18.590
So, around every tiny rock

20:18.720 --> 20:21.930
in this glacier,
there is a tiny planetary system

20:22.060 --> 20:25.060
with its own biology,
its own atmosphere,

20:25.180 --> 20:29.150
its own soil, in effect.
And its own oceans.

20:29.270 --> 20:32.190
NARRATOR: The ice here is tens
of thousands of years old.

20:32.320 --> 20:35.820
But Dr. Hoover believes
it is teeming with life.

20:35.950 --> 20:37.700
Wow. I mean,
this is, uh, spectacular.

20:37.820 --> 20:40.870
So, you just described,
basically, our environment

20:40.990 --> 20:43.370
- on a microscopic level.
- Exactly.

20:43.490 --> 20:47.250
HOOVER: There is an enormous
amount of biology above us

20:47.370 --> 20:50.460
and throughout
this wonderful glacier.

20:54.340 --> 20:57.300
What we're about to do
is take a core sample

20:57.430 --> 20:58.930
of this beautiful blue ice.

21:00.850 --> 21:02.470
TSOUKALOS: So,
what are you looking for specifically

21:02.600 --> 21:04.470
- right now?
- What I want to do first is

21:04.600 --> 21:07.940
chop away an outer layer
and get into the inner ice.

21:08.060 --> 21:11.940
We'll be looking inside of the
ice for the ice microorganisms.

21:13.480 --> 21:16.240
Now we know there
can't possibly be

21:16.360 --> 21:18.780
any contamination,

21:18.910 --> 21:22.070
because this ice has been
in the glacier

21:22.200 --> 21:25.240
and now is only freshly exposed.

21:25.370 --> 21:27.660
And now we take the core.

21:31.500 --> 21:33.540
Now we're into the ice.

21:33.670 --> 21:37.510
I'll pull the ice core out.

21:46.270 --> 21:47.430
- It's okay?
- Mm-hmm.

21:47.560 --> 21:48.810
And that's enough, right?

21:48.940 --> 21:49.980
- That's enough. Yeah.
- Okay, great.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.270
For that first sample.

21:51.400 --> 21:53.650
- Yeah, cap that.
- Okay.

21:53.770 --> 21:55.940
All the microorganisms
that grow in ice

21:56.070 --> 21:58.490
typically grow
very, very slowly.

21:58.610 --> 22:01.030
So... In fact, there are
some microorganisms

22:01.160 --> 22:03.120
that only reproduce once
every half a century,

22:03.240 --> 22:04.660
- or once a century.
- Mm-hmm.

22:04.780 --> 22:06.910
So the microbes that are
found in here,

22:07.040 --> 22:10.210
are they in suspended animation,
or are they moving around?

22:10.330 --> 22:11.370
Probably both.

22:11.500 --> 22:13.500
So, essentially,
what you're saying

22:13.630 --> 22:15.840
is that this entire cave

22:15.960 --> 22:18.550
- is filled with life.
- Yes.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.170
But not just that.

22:20.300 --> 22:23.470
This entire ice cap
is filled with life.

22:23.590 --> 22:27.560
There is this enormous amount
of microorganisms

22:27.680 --> 22:30.600
that live and thrive
and love to live

22:30.730 --> 22:32.730
in these low temperatures
of the...

22:32.850 --> 22:35.230
of the ice cave
that we have here,

22:35.360 --> 22:37.440
and ice caves
and icy, uh, glaciers

22:37.570 --> 22:39.070
all over the planet Earth.

22:39.190 --> 22:42.320
And probably all over
icy regions

22:42.450 --> 22:44.780
within our entire solar system,
and maybe...

22:44.910 --> 22:47.830
maybe widely distributed
throughout the entire universe.

22:47.950 --> 22:53.080
Are we essentially inside
the interior of a... of a comet?

22:53.210 --> 22:54.630
- Is this what it looks like?
- Well...

22:54.750 --> 22:58.300
Yes. Microorganisms
can live in ice,

22:58.420 --> 23:02.130
and ice is the dominant
component of comets.

23:02.260 --> 23:05.220
Organisms can remain alive
and protected by

23:05.340 --> 23:07.640
the icy material of the comet

23:07.760 --> 23:10.680
until it arrives into
another solar system

23:10.810 --> 23:14.440
and blows off chunks of material
that can find a planet

23:14.560 --> 23:17.230
that it can consider
a wonderful home.

23:17.360 --> 23:20.780
And so, this basically ties in
to the whole idea of panspermia.

23:20.900 --> 23:23.990
Water is a wonderful
radiation shield.

23:24.110 --> 23:26.870
And when you have
a comet that is

23:26.990 --> 23:29.450
a few miles in diameter,

23:29.580 --> 23:32.200
on the inside
of that cometary crust,

23:32.330 --> 23:34.870
there is all of this
magnificent ice that has been

23:35.000 --> 23:38.540
frozen, and then reworked
with material going in and out.

23:38.670 --> 23:40.420
So comets are not just

23:40.550 --> 23:43.170
a magnificent place
for panspermia.

23:43.300 --> 23:45.840
I am convinced that comets are
an absolutely wonderful place

23:45.970 --> 23:47.390
for the origin of life.

23:49.640 --> 23:53.810
NARRATOR: Incredibly, Giorgio
and Dr. Hoover discover

23:53.940 --> 23:57.480
that the glacier isn't home
to just microscopic life.

23:57.610 --> 24:00.270
This is magnificent.
Look, these ice worms.

24:00.400 --> 24:02.230
This one has just
crawled out of the glacier.

24:02.360 --> 24:04.740
- Oh, wow.
- He's deep in the ice. Look at this.

24:07.110 --> 24:08.700
Over here, two more ice worms.

24:08.820 --> 24:10.830
They're all in here.

24:10.950 --> 24:11.990
TSOUKALOS: He's clearly
looking for something.

24:12.120 --> 24:14.120
HOOVER:
Yeah, he's hunting.

24:14.250 --> 24:17.120
We discovered life in the most
inhospitable of environments.

24:17.250 --> 24:20.170
NARRATOR:
Amazingly, Dr. Hoover has found

24:20.290 --> 24:22.840
some of the rarest animals
on Earth.

24:22.960 --> 24:26.300
Ice worms only exist
in a handful of locations

24:26.430 --> 24:28.050
in North America.

24:28.180 --> 24:30.430
But how can animals
live and thrive

24:30.550 --> 24:32.560
in frozen blocks of ice?

24:32.680 --> 24:35.270
So, how have these
ice worms come about?

24:35.390 --> 24:38.900
HOOVER: This is an incredible
evolutionary phenomenon.

24:39.020 --> 24:41.690
They have apparently evolved
to be able to

24:41.820 --> 24:44.650
live and grow and feed
and reproduce

24:44.780 --> 24:47.030
inside of glacial ice and snow.

24:47.150 --> 24:51.410
They are feeding on algae,
cyanobacteria

24:51.530 --> 24:54.200
and other bacteria
that live in the ice,

24:54.330 --> 24:56.540
and they can make burrows
through the ice,

24:56.660 --> 24:59.500
just like an earthworm
makes burrows through the soil.

24:59.630 --> 25:02.550
And we may see
similar kinds of organisms

25:02.670 --> 25:06.510
on the polar cap of Mars,
or perhaps even in

25:06.630 --> 25:09.300
craters on the moon,
or perhaps the icy moons

25:09.430 --> 25:12.640
of our solar system,
like Europa and Enceladus.

25:12.760 --> 25:15.100
You know, it's kind of
incredible, because we came here

25:15.220 --> 25:17.690
in the hopes of finding
microbial life,

25:17.810 --> 25:19.810
and here we are
looking at ice worms,

25:19.940 --> 25:21.270
which are actual animals.

25:21.400 --> 25:23.610
So this is more
than what we'd hoped for.

25:23.730 --> 25:25.030
It-it's incredible.

25:25.150 --> 25:27.490
NARRATOR:
As Giorgio and Dr. Hoover

25:27.610 --> 25:30.450
take their samples to a lab
to be analyzed,

25:30.570 --> 25:33.660
what kind of life-forms
might they find

25:33.780 --> 25:36.080
within the Pemberton glacier?

25:36.200 --> 25:38.830
Could it support the theory
that life on comets

25:38.960 --> 25:41.710
is more common than
we ever thought possible?

25:41.830 --> 25:45.340
And if so, is it just
the random byproduct

25:45.460 --> 25:49.300
of a universe that is teeming
with various forms of life?

25:49.430 --> 25:53.470
Or is it part of
a more strategic plan?

25:53.600 --> 25:58.850
A plan deliberately designed
to alter human evolution?

26:05.070 --> 26:08.360
NARRATOR: Ancient astronaut theorist Giorgio Tsoukalos
- TSOUKALOS: See anything? -HOOVER: Oh, yes, yes.

26:08.490 --> 26:11.910
And retired NASA scientist
Dr. Richard Hoover

26:12.030 --> 26:13.950
have just collected
deep ice core samples

26:14.080 --> 26:16.990
from the Pemberton glacier
in Whistler, Canada.

26:17.120 --> 26:20.040
First sample that we got.

26:20.160 --> 26:22.540
NARRATOR: Now back in the
lab, they are hoping

26:22.670 --> 26:25.590
to observe microorganisms
that remain dormant

26:25.710 --> 26:26.920
within the glacial ice

26:27.050 --> 26:28.960
and are just now
returning to life

26:29.090 --> 26:32.130
for the first time
in thousands of years.

26:32.260 --> 26:33.840
- See anything?
- Oh, yes. Oh, yes, yes.

26:33.970 --> 26:36.220
We've got bacteria.

26:36.350 --> 26:38.310
This is fantastic.
I mean,

26:38.430 --> 26:40.520
look at this one
spinning right here.

26:40.640 --> 26:42.440
This one just moved
straight across the screen.

26:42.560 --> 26:44.730
And this one is tumbling.

26:44.860 --> 26:46.610
And notice there's a cell
that has just undergone

26:46.730 --> 26:48.780
cell division.
Here's another one that's

26:48.900 --> 26:50.490
- just undergone cell division.
- Okay.

26:52.280 --> 26:55.530
The quest for
extraterrestrial life, to me,

26:55.660 --> 26:59.250
has been a lifelong one,
as it has been with you.

26:59.370 --> 27:01.960
So I've traveled around
the world, climbing pyramids.

27:02.080 --> 27:05.080
I've looked at statues, I've
been to hundreds of museums.

27:05.210 --> 27:07.290
I've read countless
ancient texts.

27:07.420 --> 27:10.300
And here, we are looking
at something

27:10.420 --> 27:14.800
that shows extraterrestrial life
that may have come here

27:14.930 --> 27:16.550
millions of years ago.

27:16.680 --> 27:20.640
The fascinating thing is
that a far more

27:20.770 --> 27:23.230
extraordinary hypothesis
than the existence

27:23.350 --> 27:25.060
of extraterrestrial life

27:25.190 --> 27:28.360
is the hypothesis that
life exists on the planet Earth

27:28.480 --> 27:30.320
and nowhere else
in the universe.

27:30.440 --> 27:33.900
If that were to turn out to be
what really is the case,

27:34.030 --> 27:36.990
then we would be
completely unique,

27:37.120 --> 27:39.290
and we would be different
from everywhere else

27:39.410 --> 27:40.870
in the universe.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.910
And that would be
an amazing discovery.

27:44.040 --> 27:45.500
Much more amazing

27:45.620 --> 27:48.750
than finding out that bacteria
or ice worms

27:48.880 --> 27:51.760
are crawling around on
the surface of Europa today.

27:51.880 --> 27:53.880
This is incredibly fascinating,
you know.

27:54.010 --> 27:57.970
And it's also refreshing
to hear an actual NASA scientist

27:58.100 --> 28:00.310
telling me these things.

28:00.430 --> 28:03.980
NARRATOR: If,
as Dr. Hoover's research indicates,

28:04.100 --> 28:08.020
icy comets are ideal incubators
for extraterrestrial life,

28:08.150 --> 28:10.980
and if microorganisms are
incredibly common

28:11.110 --> 28:15.200
in the universe, is the Earth
being regularly bombarded

28:15.320 --> 28:17.820
by tiny alien life-forms?

28:17.950 --> 28:21.790
Life-forms that could
not only grow and mutate,

28:21.910 --> 28:25.920
but could also pose
a deadly threat to mankind?

28:30.630 --> 28:34.470
Sussex, England, 1992.

28:34.590 --> 28:37.300
Cattle are slaughtered
by the thousands

28:37.430 --> 28:39.970
as government officials
try to prevent the spread

28:40.100 --> 28:42.890
of the most frightening
new disease on Earth

28:43.020 --> 28:45.230
called "mad cow disease."

28:45.350 --> 28:47.770
It is an entirely new kind
of illness

28:47.900 --> 28:51.150
caused by bizarre proteins
called prions.

28:51.270 --> 28:53.480
FISHER: So, mad cow really
sort of challenged our,

28:53.610 --> 28:56.650
uh, traditional concepts
of disease causation

28:56.780 --> 29:00.160
in the sense that it wasn't
a bacterium, wasn't a virus.

29:00.280 --> 29:02.240
It's actually sort of like
rogue proteins

29:02.370 --> 29:04.080
that don't fold correctly

29:04.200 --> 29:07.710
and sort of pass on that
information to other proteins,

29:07.830 --> 29:09.880
and that sort of makes them
dysfunctional as well.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.880
NARRATOR: Some of the microbes
found in cometary debris

29:14.000 --> 29:17.760
contain chemical structures
very similar to prions.

29:17.880 --> 29:20.010
HOOVER: They could have
been introduced from space

29:20.140 --> 29:22.260
because of the fact that
mad cow disease

29:22.390 --> 29:24.640
seemed to have appeared
rather abruptly

29:24.770 --> 29:28.020
and been transferred
rather widely.

29:28.140 --> 29:30.940
NARRATOR: According to
ancient astronaut theorists,

29:31.060 --> 29:33.070
the sudden appearance
of mad cow disease

29:33.190 --> 29:36.190
raises an intriguing question.

29:36.320 --> 29:38.240
Could many of history's
worst epidemics

29:38.360 --> 29:39.990
have come from space?

29:40.110 --> 29:44.700
And if so, did they come here
purely by chance,

29:44.830 --> 29:47.750
or were they sent here
on purpose?

29:47.870 --> 29:51.130
BIRNES: What if the terrible
plagues that ravaged the Earth

29:51.250 --> 29:54.710
were the result of alien viruses

29:54.840 --> 29:57.300
that are constantly
bombarding the planet?

29:57.420 --> 30:01.760
NARRATOR:
August 26, 1976.

30:01.890 --> 30:05.100
The small village of Yambuku
in Zaire

30:05.220 --> 30:08.430
is struck by a deadly disease
that causes victims

30:08.560 --> 30:11.480
to ooze blood
from every orifice.

30:11.600 --> 30:14.860
The name of the disease: Ebola.

30:14.980 --> 30:18.190
Ebola is a viral
hemorrhagic fever

30:18.320 --> 30:20.200
of humans and other primates,

30:20.320 --> 30:22.570
so it causes, like,
massive internal bleeding

30:22.700 --> 30:25.830
and often death in, like,
over 50% of cases.

30:28.540 --> 30:31.920
NARRATOR: Initially thought
to be a new disease,

30:32.040 --> 30:35.210
alert historians recognized
the symptoms of Ebola

30:35.340 --> 30:38.380
as being identical to those
of an epidemic

30:38.510 --> 30:42.300
that ravaged the Roman Empire
nearly 2,000 years ago.

30:42.430 --> 30:46.350
In 250 AD, the Plague of Cyprian

30:46.470 --> 30:49.600
struck the city of Carthage
in North Africa.

30:49.730 --> 30:53.900
Incredibly contagious,
it caused infected victims

30:54.020 --> 30:56.150
to ooze blood
from every orifice,

30:56.270 --> 30:58.730
just like Ebola virus,

30:58.860 --> 31:01.740
and killed off
half the population.

31:03.660 --> 31:07.280
But just as quickly
as it appeared,

31:07.410 --> 31:11.910
the plague seemed to disappear
completely from the planet.

31:12.040 --> 31:16.750
If Ebola is present on Earth
in the third century,

31:16.880 --> 31:21.380
then disappears all the way
through to the 1970s,

31:21.510 --> 31:24.260
if it isn't somewhere
hiding on Earth,

31:24.390 --> 31:27.350
is it possible that it was
out in space itself?

31:27.470 --> 31:29.640
Perhaps on a comet?

31:29.770 --> 31:33.270
And that this is the reason
why it returned

31:33.390 --> 31:38.940
on a comet itself to rain down
more misery on humanity?

31:39.070 --> 31:42.240
NARRATOR: Was the virus
that we know as Ebola

31:42.360 --> 31:45.320
really dormant
for nearly 20 centuries?

31:45.450 --> 31:51.370
Or was it deliberately sent
to Earth not once but twice?

31:51.500 --> 31:54.710
As far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

31:54.830 --> 31:57.500
the answer is obvious.

31:57.630 --> 32:00.340
And as proof, they point
to accounts concerning

32:00.460 --> 32:03.380
another of history's
worst plagues:

32:03.510 --> 32:05.630
The Black Death.

32:05.760 --> 32:07.930
TSOUKALOS: What's interesting
about these accounts

32:08.050 --> 32:11.310
is that they seem to
have originated

32:11.430 --> 32:14.640
after something strange
was seen up in the sky.

32:14.770 --> 32:18.900
For example,
they saw this black shield

32:19.020 --> 32:22.400
travel across,
and then it is also described

32:22.530 --> 32:24.900
that this black dust

32:25.030 --> 32:28.820
came off that particular object.

32:28.950 --> 32:31.290
IMBROGNO:
Also, in the wheat fields,

32:31.410 --> 32:33.450
they reported these
strange figures

32:33.580 --> 32:36.540
holding some type of device,
like a sickle.

32:36.670 --> 32:38.670
Some people feel today
these reports were

32:38.790 --> 32:42.880
some types of extraterrestrials
causing the disease.

32:44.090 --> 32:45.130
NARRATOR:
Ironically,

32:45.260 --> 32:47.260
with half the population gone,

32:47.380 --> 32:49.050
those who survived the plague

32:49.180 --> 32:51.390
enjoyed twice the wealth
and natural resources

32:51.510 --> 32:53.600
of the previous generation.

32:53.720 --> 32:56.480
They also had much stronger
immune systems.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.520
So, could this have been part

32:58.650 --> 33:01.860
of some deliberate
extraterrestrial plan?

33:01.980 --> 33:04.110
Ancient astronaut
theorists believe

33:04.230 --> 33:07.530
that such an audacious notion
is possible.

33:07.650 --> 33:09.910
If you're an alien culture

33:10.030 --> 33:14.330
and you're seeing Earth
overpopulating

33:14.450 --> 33:19.000
to the point where the planet
can't sustain the population,

33:19.120 --> 33:21.540
- what do we do with animals in the wild?
- (gunshot)

33:21.670 --> 33:23.420
We cull them.

33:23.550 --> 33:29.050
What if these plagues
were alien cultures culling us?

33:29.180 --> 33:32.010
BARA: Well, these could
actually be designer viruses,

33:32.140 --> 33:34.310
designer bacteria
that are sent here

33:34.430 --> 33:36.930
to kill people with specific
genetic weaknesses

33:37.060 --> 33:40.060
and make the rest of the
gene pool that much stronger.

33:40.190 --> 33:44.400
NARRATOR: But if extraterrestrials
are trying to cull our population

33:44.530 --> 33:46.570
or strengthen our genetic makeup

33:46.690 --> 33:50.200
through the introduction
of microbes, why?

33:50.320 --> 33:53.490
Some ancient astronaut
theorists suspect

33:53.620 --> 33:57.660
that the ultimate objective
is to make us more like them.

34:05.460 --> 34:09.300
July 2013.

34:11.090 --> 34:12.840
Scientists announce
the discovery

34:12.969 --> 34:14.760
of an entirely new class

34:14.889 --> 34:18.350
of extremely large microbes
called Pandoraviruses.

34:20.310 --> 34:23.520
Up to 94%
of the Pandoravirus genome

34:23.650 --> 34:27.110
has nothing in common with
any other life-form on Earth.

34:27.230 --> 34:30.900
FISHER: These very large
viruses, the Pandoraviruses,

34:31.030 --> 34:34.409
they have a very high frequency
of genes that basically don't

34:34.530 --> 34:36.120
correspond to any other genes

34:36.239 --> 34:38.040
in-in other organisms
that we know of.

34:39.750 --> 34:41.790
NARRATOR:
While seemingly alien,

34:41.920 --> 34:44.380
Pandoraviruses do share
one thing in common

34:44.500 --> 34:49.170
with all life on Earth: DNA.

34:49.300 --> 34:51.469
Those who endorse panspermia say
that this supports

34:51.590 --> 34:54.010
a key part of their hypothesis.

34:54.139 --> 34:59.350
Namely, that all life in
the universe is based on DNA,

34:59.470 --> 35:01.270
and therefore,
that life on Earth

35:01.390 --> 35:04.940
is closely related
to life everywhere.

35:05.060 --> 35:10.490
If DNA is present
throughout space

35:10.610 --> 35:13.570
and we are a product of that DNA

35:13.700 --> 35:18.240
and the other species elsewhere
in the galaxy

35:18.370 --> 35:22.500
are also the result
of the same DNA,

35:22.620 --> 35:25.630
then very clearly
there's some kind of

35:25.750 --> 35:29.670
symbiotic relationship
between all of us.

35:31.260 --> 35:32.840
NARRATOR:
If all life in the universe

35:32.970 --> 35:34.840
is based on DNA,

35:34.970 --> 35:38.010
then aliens would be
closely related to humans.

35:40.390 --> 35:42.930
Is this why so many
abductees report

35:43.060 --> 35:45.310
that their alien abductors
are so interested

35:45.440 --> 35:47.440
in human genetic material?

35:49.400 --> 35:51.740
Many abductees have talked about

35:51.860 --> 35:54.820
how they were taken
on board UFOs

35:54.950 --> 35:58.870
and subjected
to medical experimentation.

35:58.990 --> 36:04.540
Witnesses talk about blood,
sperm, eggs

36:04.670 --> 36:06.580
being removed from their bodies.

36:08.340 --> 36:10.920
IMBROGNO: It's very possible
that an alien intelligence

36:11.050 --> 36:13.010
is tinkering with our DNA

36:13.130 --> 36:16.430
to try to make us
more compatible to them.

36:16.550 --> 36:20.560
And that perhaps one day,
the two species will unite.

36:20.680 --> 36:23.480
And they will no longer
be our gods,

36:23.600 --> 36:25.440
but we will be their equals.

36:25.560 --> 36:28.940
BARA: If aliens are
using these microbes

36:29.060 --> 36:31.650
to make us more like them,
then obviously we're gonna start

36:31.780 --> 36:35.650
to show signs of that sort of
genetic physical evolution.

36:35.780 --> 36:38.410
In other words, our testosterone
levels should go down,

36:38.530 --> 36:41.790
we're going to become
more frail,

36:41.910 --> 36:45.000
we're probably going
to become more androgynous.

36:45.120 --> 36:48.380
Our intelligence
is gonna be spiked.

36:48.500 --> 36:52.420
NARRATOR: Some point out that these
changes are happening already.

36:52.550 --> 36:54.550
BIRNES: There are
trends in the evolution

36:54.670 --> 36:56.130
of human beings right now.

36:56.260 --> 36:57.970
Sperm counts are going down.

36:58.090 --> 37:01.390
Sperm counts are
going down, by the way,

37:01.510 --> 37:04.560
as the world's population
is crashing

37:04.680 --> 37:07.230
through eight billion
to ten billion.

37:09.230 --> 37:11.400
BARA: Maybe we'll become
more like the aliens,

37:11.520 --> 37:13.690
and perhaps that means that
we're actually more compatible

37:13.820 --> 37:15.280
with them genetically,

37:15.400 --> 37:17.280
if that path is the one
that's laid out.

37:17.400 --> 37:19.610
So, you could actually look
at the development

37:19.740 --> 37:21.700
of higher intelligence
as, again,

37:21.830 --> 37:23.290
kind of a genetic Trojan horse

37:23.410 --> 37:25.250
that eventually leads us
to a point

37:25.370 --> 37:28.580
where it's far easier for us
to be crossed genetically

37:28.710 --> 37:30.790
with alien species.

37:32.960 --> 37:35.630
NARRATOR: Could human
beings be the subjects

37:35.760 --> 37:37.970
of an ingenious
bioengineering project

37:38.090 --> 37:40.970
conducted by extraterrestrials?

37:41.090 --> 37:43.310
Ancient astronaut
theorists believe

37:43.430 --> 37:45.970
that not only is the answer yes,

37:46.100 --> 37:49.600
but that this process,
while at times painful,

37:49.730 --> 37:52.770
will ultimately
benefit humanity.

37:52.900 --> 37:55.730
But they also warn
that the extraterrestrials

37:55.860 --> 37:58.280
may have another agenda,

37:58.400 --> 38:01.570
one that doesn't benefit us,
but them.

38:13.380 --> 38:15.670
NARRATOR: The scientific
journal <i>Current Biology</i>

38:15.800 --> 38:18.800
reports that biologists
at the University of Rochester

38:18.920 --> 38:21.760
have solved the mystery
of the pea aphid,

38:21.890 --> 38:25.850
a tiny sap-sucking insect
that is normally wingless

38:25.970 --> 38:28.430
but periodically develops wings

38:28.560 --> 38:31.190
when it needs to seek out
new plants to colonize.

38:31.310 --> 38:33.770
What they found
is that the genes

38:33.900 --> 38:37.940
that form the on/off switch
for wings belong to a virus,

38:38.070 --> 38:40.570
the genome of which
has become fully incorporated

38:40.700 --> 38:42.280
into that of its host.

38:45.080 --> 38:47.830
The researchers suggest
that while this is beneficial

38:47.950 --> 38:50.620
to the aphid,
it is actually the virus

38:50.750 --> 38:52.290
that induces wing development

38:52.420 --> 38:54.460
in order to spread
itself around.

38:56.550 --> 39:00.090
NARRATOR: Similarly,
it was also found in 2019

39:00.220 --> 39:03.720
that many wasps carry a virus
that increases their longevity,

39:03.840 --> 39:07.220
enabling the virus
to be spread further.

39:07.350 --> 39:09.930
FISHER: Viruses sort of
straddle our concepts

39:10.060 --> 39:12.140
of living or nonliving

39:12.270 --> 39:14.730
because they require a host

39:14.860 --> 39:17.440
in order to reproduce themselves

39:17.570 --> 39:20.820
and also to carry out
any life function.

39:20.940 --> 39:24.410
So they can't metabolize
or utilize their own energy.

39:24.530 --> 39:26.700
They have to rely
on a host cell to do that

39:26.830 --> 39:29.410
and to make copies
of themselves as well.

39:29.540 --> 39:32.370
NARRATOR:
On its own, a virus is inert.

39:32.500 --> 39:35.080
It only comes to life
and is able to reproduce

39:35.210 --> 39:38.130
once it comes in contact
with a host.

39:38.250 --> 39:41.670
Like the viruses themselves,
if extraterrestrials

39:41.800 --> 39:44.010
are altering humans,
is it perhaps

39:44.130 --> 39:47.430
to further their own species?

39:47.550 --> 39:49.260
Are they slowly transforming us

39:49.390 --> 39:51.810
into new incarnations
of themselves,

39:51.930 --> 39:55.600
not to advance humankind,
but their own kind?

39:55.730 --> 39:57.860
Perhaps.

39:57.980 --> 40:00.610
But some ancient astronaut
theorists suggest

40:00.730 --> 40:02.530
that, as is the case
with the aphid

40:02.650 --> 40:04.320
and also the wasp,

40:04.450 --> 40:08.280
this process might be
mutually beneficial.

40:08.410 --> 40:10.990
POPE:
One theory is that these

40:11.120 --> 40:12.660
extraterrestrial visitors,

40:12.790 --> 40:15.370
they are a dying race,

40:15.500 --> 40:20.550
and that they are injecting
new genetic material

40:20.670 --> 40:23.340
which will help save them.

40:23.470 --> 40:28.300
Another related theory is...
Let's take human DNA,

40:28.430 --> 40:33.430
let's take alien DNA, and let's
create something even better.

40:36.190 --> 40:38.100
TSOUKALOS:
I think that humankind

40:38.230 --> 40:42.980
has been part of a...
eternal experiment,

40:43.110 --> 40:46.110
something that's begun
a long, long time ago,

40:46.240 --> 40:49.950
and I think that this is
an ongoing process.

40:50.080 --> 40:53.870
Now, figuring out
what the change is,

40:54.000 --> 40:56.120
is... your guess
is as good as mine.

40:56.250 --> 41:00.250
COLLINS:
If we find that viruses

41:00.380 --> 41:03.840
do come from space, then we know

41:03.960 --> 41:08.550
that because there is
a relationship between viruses

41:08.680 --> 41:11.300
and evolution,
that this is something

41:11.430 --> 41:14.180
that must be universal.

41:14.310 --> 41:17.440
It's something that connects us

41:17.560 --> 41:20.770
with every other
possible life source

41:20.900 --> 41:23.440
everywhere out there
in the universe.

41:28.110 --> 41:31.410
NARRATOR: Is it possible that the
history of disease on our planet

41:31.530 --> 41:33.790
is not only a human story,

41:33.910 --> 41:36.120
but an extraterrestrial one?

41:36.250 --> 41:40.290
As far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

41:40.420 --> 41:43.290
the answer is a profound "yes."

41:43.420 --> 41:46.800
And if such a notion is true,
they insist that

41:46.920 --> 41:48.880
these so-called
"alien infections"

41:49.010 --> 41:52.600
are not meant to destroy us,
but to serve as a kind

41:52.720 --> 41:56.140
of inoculation,
a preparation for the day

41:56.270 --> 42:01.190
when mankind comes face-to-face
with its alien relatives.
