WEBVTT

00:11.430 --> 00:14.722
I want him dead. I want his
whole world turned to dust.

00:15.836 --> 00:17.998
I'm part of something
bigger now. Much bigger.

00:18.036 --> 00:20.036
You'll learn what you need to know.

00:20.052 --> 00:21.895
I'm not a goddess. You are.

00:21.934 --> 00:22.944
Now act like one.

00:23.645 --> 00:26.441
Such a cruel and ugly thing
to do to a little girl.

00:27.402 --> 00:28.906
You know who am I now?

00:29.794 --> 00:31.176
What is it about us?

00:32.500 --> 00:34.950
Is that true, Scott?
Are you dangerous?

00:41.816 --> 00:44.637
And now begins the ancient word.

00:44.669 --> 00:47.503
The sun sleeps below the sky,

00:47.589 --> 00:50.473
and the world turns upside down.

00:50.558 --> 00:53.393
In the night, we make our feast.

00:56.264 --> 00:58.348
For centuries, I danced for them.

00:58.448 --> 01:01.851
The Blood Gatherer. The Bringer of Souls.

01:01.953 --> 01:04.069
I brought them the lost ones.

01:04.188 --> 01:07.523
The troubled ones. The desperate ones.

01:09.027 --> 01:11.861
Now I am free,

01:11.996 --> 01:15.765
and the world turns upside down again.

01:15.867 --> 01:19.836
They are thirsty for revenge,
and nothing will stop them...

01:19.921 --> 01:22.705
No boundaries, no borders.

01:22.841 --> 01:24.507
They will come for me.

01:24.592 --> 01:26.843
But I am coming for them.

01:26.928 --> 01:29.212
Their empire of blood will fall,

01:29.347 --> 01:34.717
and I will not rest until it all burns.

01:56.958 --> 02:00.910
Hey, Sonja, listen. There's, uh, there's
something I need to talk to you about.

02:03.715 --> 02:05.581
What's wrong?

02:05.717 --> 02:07.300
What's wrong...

02:07.418 --> 02:09.001
is you're dead.

02:13.758 --> 02:14.891
Well, what are you waiting for?

02:14.976 --> 02:17.226
- Now it all makes sense.
- Oh, good.

02:17.312 --> 02:21.931
Coupla days ago, dude comes in,
says his name is Richie Sanz,

02:22.066 --> 02:24.350
says that Eddie Cruickshank
vouches for him.

02:24.435 --> 02:27.436
He's a big player in the flesh trade.

02:27.572 --> 02:30.156
Wants to make a deal with the Browns.

02:30.275 --> 02:33.776
- The Browns, huh?
- Now that I see you, it all makes sense.

02:33.912 --> 02:38.331
He ain't no Richie Sanz, he's
Richie Gec-ko, and you...

02:38.449 --> 02:40.500
- you're the other one.
- That's one and only to you, asshole.

02:40.618 --> 02:43.002
Your brother took something from me.

02:43.121 --> 02:45.454
Now, I'm gonna take something from you.

02:45.540 --> 02:49.258
Okay, wait a second. She shouldn't
have to die because of my brother.

02:49.344 --> 02:51.344
Maybe I got something else planned for her.

02:52.680 --> 02:54.046
Oh, so you're gonna kill me

02:54.132 --> 02:56.432
- 'cause of this asshole's brother?
- Okay, sweetheart, men are talking.

02:56.518 --> 02:58.518
- Now's not the time.
- Men are talking? Shut up.

02:58.636 --> 03:00.052
- Don't talk to me like that.
- Talk to you like what?

03:00.138 --> 03:01.938
- You just called me an asshole.
- Because you're an asshole.

03:02.023 --> 03:03.105
- No. Clearly I didn't...
- Shut up

03:03.191 --> 03:05.474
or I'll shoot you both
in the goddamned face!

03:05.560 --> 03:06.726
Do me a favor, shoot me in the face.

03:08.813 --> 03:10.613
Oh, shit!

03:21.826 --> 03:23.826
- Good timing.
- Timing?

03:23.912 --> 03:27.630
You're just lucky I got a
prostate the size of a softball.

03:54.062 --> 03:56.062
<font color="#ff0000">Sync and corrections by btsix
www.addic7ed.com</font>

03:56.860 --> 04:00.168
This is my score. Ain't nobody
takin' this one away from me.

04:00.267 --> 04:03.165
Okay. Eddie. Eddie...

04:03.251 --> 04:05.701
nobody's taking anything away from anybody.

04:05.837 --> 04:08.537
But that formerly living person right there

04:08.549 --> 04:11.133
said Richie was trying to
do a deal with the Browns,

04:11.218 --> 04:14.970
however... politically
incorrect that sounds.

04:15.089 --> 04:18.923
And you've been tracking
said Browns, am I right?

04:19.059 --> 04:22.895
I mean, what is this shit?
You got Alvarez, 120K,

04:22.980 --> 04:26.565
- Garces 95K, Greely 150K.
- That ain't a Mexican name.

04:26.650 --> 04:29.935
Jesus Christ, Eddie. You're tracking
a score and Richard's onto it.

04:30.020 --> 04:31.770
Richard ain't got nothin' to do with this.

04:31.856 --> 04:33.998
Again, the stiff said different.

04:35.359 --> 04:38.110
All right.

04:38.195 --> 04:39.851
You know I got ears everywhere.

04:39.905 --> 04:40.948
People tell me things.

04:41.081 --> 04:42.030
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:44.919 --> 04:48.837
These are all stash houses.
Drugs, guns, money. You name it.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.790
It all runs through here, mostly by trucks.

04:51.926 --> 04:54.960
What gets to the other
side is ten percent less.

04:57.765 --> 05:01.466
Okay, so you're telling me that...

05:01.602 --> 05:04.353
somewhere in here, it's getting skimmed.

05:07.308 --> 05:09.525
Yeah, and I hear they
even got flesh trucks.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.443
Lots of human cargo.

05:11.529 --> 05:13.729
Jesus Christ, Eddie. That's
like the entire state of Texas.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.981
- It's huge!
- You think that's huge...

05:20.154 --> 05:21.737
Have a look at that.

05:23.657 --> 05:28.327
- This says 33 million dollars.
- Bingo.

05:28.379 --> 05:31.547
Somewhere in here is the Shangri-fuckin'-la

05:31.665 --> 05:33.131
of stash houses.

05:33.217 --> 05:35.000
Your brother might be onto it.

05:35.085 --> 05:37.836
You ask me, he's onto somethin' much worse.

05:37.922 --> 05:40.389
Eddie, this is huge.

05:40.507 --> 05:43.392
This is very, very good, Eddie.
This will work.

05:52.403 --> 05:54.353
Richard...

05:59.159 --> 06:01.660
Richard. Listen to me...

06:04.915 --> 06:06.698
Richard...

06:16.126 --> 06:18.313
_

06:19.964 --> 06:21.430
Mmm.

06:21.548 --> 06:25.100
It's so sweet and so earthy on the tongue.

06:25.219 --> 06:27.436
And then comes that little mordida.

06:27.554 --> 06:31.056
Nothing is worth eating
without a little bite, right?

06:33.060 --> 06:35.527
Culebras.

06:35.613 --> 06:39.948
We can take bullets, but we
can't take a real winter.

06:40.067 --> 06:43.068
I guess that's the price we pay for, uh...

06:44.288 --> 06:47.122
being cold-blooded.

06:47.241 --> 06:51.326
If you're going to kill me, just do it.

06:52.579 --> 06:55.080
After I defeated the Labyrinth,

06:55.215 --> 06:57.165
I...

06:58.385 --> 07:02.170
forged this especially for you.

07:05.926 --> 07:09.094
And before I left...
I took this.

07:11.765 --> 07:14.566
It's going to be perfect for the show.

07:14.652 --> 07:16.601
I'm never going back.

07:16.687 --> 07:19.905
Oh, no. You will.

07:20.024 --> 07:22.658
After you've been re-educated.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.160
I won't go.

07:28.332 --> 07:30.582
After I'm done with you,

07:30.668 --> 07:33.251
you're going to be begging for it.

07:34.505 --> 07:37.456
_

07:37.591 --> 07:38.924
Niña...

07:39.169 --> 07:40.796
_

07:46.050 --> 07:49.801
Yes, a lovely shipment,
very desirable young ladies.

07:49.887 --> 07:52.270
And now that Carlos gave back the
center cut, it's even better.

07:52.306 --> 07:54.773
Yeah. We'll deposit
payment in the usual account.

07:54.858 --> 07:57.642
Well, then, good. That's the least you
can do, 'cause my house is empty!

07:57.695 --> 07:59.144
- Now, tell me what happened.
- What happened?

07:59.229 --> 08:01.313
Well, Carlos decided he wanted to

08:01.448 --> 08:03.281
have a taste before he took delivery,

08:03.367 --> 08:06.318
and then he ran off with one
of my new suppliers instead.

08:06.403 --> 08:09.788
- New supplier?
- Yeah. A stunner whose name I didn't get.

08:09.873 --> 08:14.242
But muy linda, that chica. And her
partner's named Richard Sanz.

08:17.715 --> 08:20.382
- Where are they?
- I don't know about the chica,

08:20.501 --> 08:22.000
but I'm lookin' at Sanz right now.

08:22.086 --> 08:24.052
I want you to listen to me very carefully.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.171
Do whatever you have to
do to keep him there.

08:26.256 --> 08:29.007
I got two guys with machine guns
on him, I think we're good.

08:29.093 --> 08:31.587
That won't be enough.

08:31.687 --> 08:33.260
- Uh huh. I gotta go.
- Don't hang up.

08:33.347 --> 08:34.846
Listen to me!

08:34.932 --> 08:36.347
Hey, buddy.

08:36.482 --> 08:39.067
You lost your cargo and your girlfriend.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.019
So what do you think's gonna happen now?

08:41.071 --> 08:42.988
I'm gonna kill everyone in this room.

08:45.526 --> 08:47.609
And then go and get my girl.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.194
Okay.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.329
- You believe this fuckin' guy?
- Richard,

08:51.415 --> 08:55.784
don't try to save me. Remember the plan.

08:57.171 --> 08:58.920
Follow the flesh.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.423
Find Malvado's hideout.

09:01.542 --> 09:02.707
Tell me where.

09:02.793 --> 09:04.709
What the hell you doin'? Hey.

09:04.845 --> 09:07.345
Hey, Skippy. Wake up.

09:07.431 --> 09:11.049
Where'd you send that truck?
Where's it going?

09:11.135 --> 09:13.051
Well, it's goin' where it always goes.
What do you care? You're dead.

09:13.137 --> 09:15.971
- How do I get there?
- How do you get there. How 'bout this?

09:16.056 --> 09:19.307
How 'bout after we take out
that kneecap and this kneecap,

09:19.393 --> 09:21.526
you can try to gimp up I-40...

09:21.612 --> 09:24.029
You're welcome.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.080
Lovely.

09:42.216 --> 09:44.549
- What's your problem?
- My problem?

09:44.635 --> 09:47.419
- I just saved your ass.
- He was about to tell me everything!

09:49.173 --> 09:50.889
Where the hell are you goin' now?

09:50.974 --> 09:53.425
- I don't need your help.
- Yeah? Well, Uncle Eddie did.

09:53.510 --> 09:54.893
He almost got killed because of you.

09:54.978 --> 09:56.595
This has got nothing to
do with Eddie or you.

09:56.680 --> 09:59.514
Well, it's a little late for
that, wouldn't you say?

09:59.600 --> 10:01.900
I heard you asking about a truck.

10:01.985 --> 10:05.320
You tryin' to follow it?

10:05.439 --> 10:07.856
- Are you insane?
- What truck.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.941
It's a truck. Full of people.

10:10.027 --> 10:12.277
Yeah? What kind of people?

10:12.412 --> 10:15.413
Little girl people?

10:15.499 --> 10:17.666
- Jesus Christ, Richard.
- Look, none of them are gonna get eaten,

10:17.784 --> 10:19.701
- if you just let me get outta here.
- The shipment's for the Browns,

10:19.786 --> 10:22.504
isn't it? You're using them as
bait to find the boss's hideout.

10:22.623 --> 10:24.623
Just move. Let me hot-wire this thing.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.126
- Fuck!
- I'm driving.

10:28.262 --> 10:29.794
Oh, no. No way.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.680
Truck's getting away.

10:41.388 --> 10:44.106
No!

10:47.111 --> 10:49.194
That's no way to treat family.

10:49.313 --> 10:51.647
Get up.

11:27.067 --> 11:29.401
Stop! Stop it!

11:29.520 --> 11:33.405
Stop! Stop. Please?

11:40.114 --> 11:41.246
Stay.

11:42.366 --> 11:44.166
What are you doing?

11:46.837 --> 11:48.203
You called him, didn't you?

11:48.289 --> 11:50.172
I thought he could help.

11:54.178 --> 11:56.128
I'm not gonna let him hurt you.

11:56.213 --> 11:58.213
Good luck with that.

12:04.188 --> 12:05.971
What is that?

12:06.056 --> 12:08.357
Ranger Gonzalez, you cannot
just come in here and...

12:08.442 --> 12:11.610
I didn't just come in here.
I've been watching the house.

12:11.729 --> 12:14.279
I saw you bury that girl.

12:14.398 --> 12:16.398
And you helped him.

12:16.483 --> 12:19.985
If you were smart, you'll let me do my job.

12:20.070 --> 12:23.372
What job? You the cholo Van Helsing now?

12:28.495 --> 12:32.581
Kate said you were down there. The Twister?

12:32.666 --> 12:34.967
Those vipers are up to something.

12:35.085 --> 12:38.053
And you're gonna tell
me what it's all about.

12:38.138 --> 12:40.922
Sure. Right after I rip your skull open.

12:41.058 --> 12:43.725
Shhh.

12:47.398 --> 12:49.731
Don't move...

12:51.986 --> 12:55.153
or you're dead.

12:55.272 --> 12:57.272
Dead?! He's gonna
be worse than dead.

12:57.408 --> 13:01.193
You tell that punk I'm gonna rip those
mission control glasses off his head

13:01.278 --> 13:02.944
and I'm gonna shove 'em up his ass!

13:03.030 --> 13:04.446
And I'm gonna reach up a little further

13:04.531 --> 13:06.164
and I'm gonna pull that
big-ass brain of his

13:06.283 --> 13:08.867
right back down through his asshole.
You got that?

13:08.952 --> 13:11.336
Yeah, okay. Got it.

13:11.455 --> 13:14.256
What did he say?

13:14.341 --> 13:16.124
He sends his love.

13:16.210 --> 13:18.543
I don't even
know why you called him.

13:18.629 --> 13:21.463
He knows a sheriff up a ways that's
crooked as a Picasso painting.

13:21.598 --> 13:23.298
He's gonna help us locate the truck.

13:23.384 --> 13:25.434
We don't need any help.

13:25.519 --> 13:28.553
I'm sorry, is there some kinda snake
radar in that melon of yours now?

13:28.639 --> 13:30.138
As far as I can tell,
we're flying blind here.

13:30.224 --> 13:32.641
Hey, look, Blanchard said it's up the I-45.

13:32.726 --> 13:35.310
I would have had the answer if you
hadn't started blastin' away in there

13:35.446 --> 13:36.945
like it was the goddamn Tech Noir.

13:37.031 --> 13:38.814
I wasn't gonna take any chances, okay?

13:38.899 --> 13:41.233
And I'm not gonna take any
chances with this truck, either.

13:41.318 --> 13:43.568
Aw, you're gonna save the little girls?

13:43.654 --> 13:46.321
You the defender of justice now? Is that
why you got the extra little flames

13:46.407 --> 13:48.990
tattooed on your neck? You know,
maybe you should get a chest dragon

13:49.126 --> 13:51.960
- like Iron Fist.
- Look, I am not a defender of justice, okay?

13:52.046 --> 13:56.748
But I am the archenemy of
dumb-assery, of which you are king.

13:56.834 --> 14:01.386
The ink I got from my girl. Who also
almost died because of you, by the way.

14:01.505 --> 14:03.588
You got yourself a new squeeze?

14:03.674 --> 14:06.391
She another version of your ex-wife?
'Cause they all are.

14:06.510 --> 14:09.845
No, actually she's a lot like your girl.
Pokes holes in your skin.

14:09.980 --> 14:12.481
Only difference is, she
doesn't suck you dry.

14:14.735 --> 14:17.736
Oh, what? It's not all butterflies
and gumdrops with the snake queen?

14:17.855 --> 14:19.821
She's complicated.

14:19.907 --> 14:23.525
No. Algebra is complicated.
She's fuckin'...

14:23.660 --> 14:27.245
A.P. trig. Richard,
you're gonna start a war.

14:27.364 --> 14:29.030
She's taking you on a suicide mission.

14:29.166 --> 14:30.866
But I'm sorry, I'm sure
that doesn't matter to you.

14:30.951 --> 14:33.368
You're happy being Richard... What was it,

14:33.454 --> 14:36.088
Richard Sanz? Ms. Sanz from Sacred Heart?

14:36.206 --> 14:37.255
You couldn't think of anything else?

14:37.374 --> 14:39.091
She was the best teacher we ever had.

14:41.678 --> 14:44.045
- Hey.
- No texting and driving.

14:44.181 --> 14:48.417
Sheriff's gonna meet us. It's close.

15:00.731 --> 15:02.948
I can make this real easy.

15:03.066 --> 15:05.117
I can bite him and put out an A.P.B.
myself.

15:05.235 --> 15:07.652
Look, the only thing you're biting
is your own goddamn tongue, okay?

15:07.738 --> 15:09.287
- But...
- Shut up.

15:09.406 --> 15:11.456
Let me do the talking.

15:12.659 --> 15:14.793
I look like Poncharello to you?

15:14.912 --> 15:17.078
Sheriff, we're in a bit of a rush, so...

15:17.164 --> 15:21.833
Do I... look like Poncharello to you?

15:21.919 --> 15:24.753
Do you even know who Poncharello is?

15:24.888 --> 15:27.255
Yes, I know who Frank Poncharello is.

15:27.391 --> 15:31.259
Then you know he lives in a fantasy world where
he can just get on the radio and call out

15:31.395 --> 15:34.429
a Be On The Lookout.
'Cause in the real world,

15:34.565 --> 15:37.849
a BOLO's a tricky thing,
bureaucratically speaking.

15:37.935 --> 15:41.436
Just tell 'em that it's stolen merchandise.

15:43.690 --> 15:47.492
Look, we just need a bead on the truck.

15:47.611 --> 15:50.328
Just have your boys give us
a call when they spot it.

15:50.447 --> 15:54.199
You still need a person of interest.
You got a person of interest?

15:54.284 --> 15:58.453
Benjamin Franklin. And about
twenty of his brothers?

15:58.539 --> 16:01.790
Bureaucrats are gonna need...
three times that many.

16:11.268 --> 16:16.354
I got this deep-vein thrombosis from
sitting in patrol cars over the years.

16:16.473 --> 16:18.940
That money is gonna come in handy.

16:19.026 --> 16:22.110
Think that Mexican
Coumadin is worth a damn?

16:22.196 --> 16:26.815
Sheriff, we're in a bit of a rush, so...
if you please.

16:26.900 --> 16:29.784
You still haven't answered my question.

16:30.988 --> 16:32.871
Who'd you steal it from?

16:32.990 --> 16:35.657
It's not exactly stolen, okay?

16:35.792 --> 16:39.160
It's a... delivery that got hijacked.

16:39.246 --> 16:41.580
- From whom?
- Nobody you know...

16:41.665 --> 16:43.582
or want to know. Trust me.

16:43.667 --> 16:46.835
Now, why don't you let me decide
who's on my friends list?

16:50.340 --> 16:52.173
You want me to talk now?

16:52.309 --> 16:54.509
Please.

16:54.645 --> 16:57.095
They're big players. From down south.

16:57.180 --> 17:00.315
They probably own a piece of the factory
that makes those little pills of yours.

17:01.852 --> 17:03.401
You don't wanna cross these people.

17:03.520 --> 17:04.603
Cartel?

17:04.688 --> 17:06.021
So much bigger.

17:12.362 --> 17:17.031
Well... I'll just stick
with the white devils.

17:17.117 --> 17:18.750
That's the devil I know.

17:28.045 --> 17:29.628
Vámonos.

17:31.131 --> 17:33.932
You can't keep me in the cold forever.

17:34.051 --> 17:34.966
Watch me.

17:36.637 --> 17:38.937
I guess I was already...

17:39.056 --> 17:41.606
so frigid when I was with you.

17:41.725 --> 17:45.310
You had so little to offer, Carlitos.

18:04.164 --> 18:07.997
_

18:09.544 --> 18:11.440
_

18:11.896 --> 18:14.689
_

18:15.193 --> 18:19.262
_

18:37.447 --> 18:39.614
You don't know this place?

18:39.700 --> 18:41.783
All those years...

18:41.918 --> 18:43.952
I called you diosa.

18:44.037 --> 18:46.004
Your legend grew.

18:48.041 --> 18:49.874
The Blood Gatherer.

18:49.960 --> 18:52.711
The Mistress of the Macabre...

18:52.796 --> 18:55.130
When the world turns upside down,

18:55.215 --> 18:57.632
she sets it right.

18:57.718 --> 19:01.019
What was her name? The one
that I was going to feed on.

19:02.139 --> 19:04.556
Ah, Paloma. Yeah.

19:05.809 --> 19:07.559
She believed.

19:07.644 --> 19:10.695
Like so many others...

19:10.814 --> 19:13.314
even those who are not like us.

19:13.400 --> 19:16.151
Completely and utterly devoted to you...

19:16.286 --> 19:19.487
and you won't even look at them.

19:20.907 --> 19:22.991
Look at them.

19:23.076 --> 19:25.326
Look.

19:27.130 --> 19:29.664
You're not a monster.

19:29.800 --> 19:31.966
You're a goddess.

19:36.140 --> 19:37.895
I'm lookin' for a killer.

19:38.201 --> 19:40.216
I found these bodies in a mass grave.

19:40.287 --> 19:42.037
Probably put there by a culebra.

19:42.156 --> 19:46.124
None of these mean anything to you.
Not even the symbol.

19:48.077 --> 19:50.044
Hmm.

19:55.251 --> 19:56.884
What about that?

19:58.254 --> 19:59.887
Aztec golf club?

20:03.142 --> 20:04.508
Found it in the Codex.

20:04.644 --> 20:06.594
It's got obsidian teeth along the edge.

20:06.679 --> 20:10.014
I think the killer used
it to hobble the people

20:10.149 --> 20:12.099
right before they were buried alive.

20:12.185 --> 20:15.653
You keep talking about this Kotex.

20:15.738 --> 20:18.823
That sounds like a... a Kate question.

20:20.610 --> 20:24.111
- You know who this is?
- That is a MILF.

20:24.197 --> 20:25.746
It's my wife and daughter.

20:25.865 --> 20:27.915
Sex Machine came to my house

20:28.034 --> 20:30.117
and almost killed them both.

20:30.203 --> 20:33.037
He wanted the Codex. Why?

20:36.876 --> 20:39.844
Scott, please. Please, just tell
him everything he wants to know.

20:41.848 --> 20:43.964
Please.

20:44.050 --> 20:46.383
Look, Tanner's nothing, all right?

20:46.469 --> 20:49.103
He's a newb. He's just
trying to impress the boss.

20:49.222 --> 20:51.639
Boss? What boss?

20:53.142 --> 20:54.892
That's why you killed Jessica.

20:55.027 --> 20:57.228
Some kind of initiation.

20:57.363 --> 20:58.729
I never said that.

20:58.865 --> 21:01.232
Okay, wait a second. What boss?

21:01.317 --> 21:03.734
There's nine Lords, man.
Malvado's one of them.

21:03.870 --> 21:05.820
I haven't met the other ones,
but from what I've heard,

21:05.905 --> 21:08.572
they got a nice little mafia
that runs from Mexico to Texas.

21:08.658 --> 21:10.908
That's all that I know.

21:11.043 --> 21:13.294
Unless you wanna whack me on
the head with some obsidian.

21:13.412 --> 21:15.663
Hmm.

21:19.552 --> 21:21.418
Dude is crazy as fuck.

21:21.504 --> 21:23.754
Why don't you just stop fighting him?

21:23.890 --> 21:25.422
And stop fighting me.

21:25.508 --> 21:26.891
Stop trying to save me.

21:28.478 --> 21:31.095
You are my brother and I love you.

21:31.230 --> 21:32.680
You're wasting your time.

21:34.567 --> 21:38.352
True love is loving the unlovable.

21:45.945 --> 21:48.612
What is that?

21:49.782 --> 21:52.283
Obsidian. The dark mirror.

21:59.592 --> 22:00.958
You asked for it.

22:15.141 --> 22:18.642
The bonds. You had
los Geckos steal them for you.

22:18.728 --> 22:23.364
And a storm of blood shall come
unlike anything the world has seen,

22:23.482 --> 22:24.899
and it will quench our thirst.

22:27.653 --> 22:31.455
Ranger Gonzalez, are you all right?
What happened?

22:32.742 --> 22:35.993
I met his boss.

22:36.128 --> 22:37.995
What are they doin' with the bonds?

22:38.130 --> 22:42.499
Some kinda map. That's all I know.

22:42.635 --> 22:45.469
They said something about a storm of blood.

22:47.006 --> 22:49.006
What storm of blood?

22:50.593 --> 22:52.927
Don't know.

22:53.012 --> 22:55.145
But whatever it is,

22:55.231 --> 22:57.014
you can't stop it.

23:00.519 --> 23:04.188
They worship you, and you turn them away.

23:04.273 --> 23:08.025
- They're lost.
- Stop fighting it.

23:08.160 --> 23:10.694
- I never asked to be a diosa.
- Then tell them.

23:10.830 --> 23:12.696
!Pueblo!

23:12.832 --> 23:15.583
I present to you the cause
of your hunger and misery.

23:17.370 --> 23:19.370
!Tu diosa!

23:22.959 --> 23:25.042
That's it?

23:25.177 --> 23:27.127
You like wasting your
breath praying to her?

23:34.854 --> 23:36.673
_

23:41.644 --> 23:44.979
I can't help these people.

23:45.064 --> 23:47.281
Yes, you can.

23:47.400 --> 23:49.566
You asked me to help you kill Malvado.

23:49.702 --> 23:51.235
We still can.

23:51.320 --> 23:53.821
I have a plan to give you everything.

23:53.906 --> 23:57.908
The problem with your plans, Carlos...

23:58.044 --> 23:59.576
is that you come with them.

23:59.712 --> 24:02.046
Oh, so you choose a... a myopic boy

24:02.131 --> 24:05.165
with his mother's milk on his chin.

24:08.054 --> 24:10.004
It's about Richard, isn't it?

24:10.089 --> 24:13.257
It's about you, and the prison of vengeance

24:13.392 --> 24:15.175
that you have built for yourself.

24:18.314 --> 24:21.432
Let me tell you something
about prison, Carlitos.

24:21.517 --> 24:24.768
It's hard. And unjust.

24:24.904 --> 24:29.189
But after a while, it becomes your home.

24:29.275 --> 24:34.445
And not just because you
live and breathe in it.

24:34.580 --> 24:39.116
Because you learn things. You grow.

24:39.251 --> 24:43.787
And you turn from an
innocent girl to a queen.

24:43.873 --> 24:48.292
You were never a queen. You
were Malvado's plaything!

24:48.427 --> 24:50.344
I was the one who helped you defeat him.

24:50.463 --> 24:53.797
You are just like him.

24:53.883 --> 24:55.849
You just want me for yourself.

25:01.357 --> 25:04.641
Vengeance may be a prison...

25:07.063 --> 25:10.147
but it's my prison.

25:10.282 --> 25:12.866
You don't know a thing about it.

25:12.985 --> 25:14.368
You think you've suffered?

25:18.824 --> 25:21.575
Let me show what I endured
in the Labyrinth.

25:25.331 --> 25:27.965
I watched you rise to greatness.

25:28.050 --> 25:31.301
You were more than king and queen.

25:31.387 --> 25:33.420
You were gods.

25:33.506 --> 25:36.640
I watched you live an entire life with him.

25:36.726 --> 25:38.759
A life of love,

25:38.844 --> 25:41.762
happiness, and fulfillment.

26:03.702 --> 26:07.755
I couldn't stop it, I could only watch it.

26:07.873 --> 26:10.707
Again... and again.

26:10.843 --> 26:14.294
Time has no beginning and no
end inside the Labyrinth.

26:14.380 --> 26:16.930
You and Richard never changed.

26:17.049 --> 26:19.433
You remained immortal.

26:19.552 --> 26:21.351
Not me.

26:21.437 --> 26:24.388
They tell me I was only
in there three months,

26:24.523 --> 26:28.559
but to me, it was an eternity.

26:28.694 --> 26:32.229
I became an old man.

26:32.314 --> 26:34.615
And I was left behind.

26:34.733 --> 26:37.734
In the darkness. For an eternity.

26:41.407 --> 26:46.376
I lost everything, over and over again...

26:46.462 --> 26:50.881
until I agreed to give them what
they demanded... submission.

26:50.966 --> 26:56.086
Soldier no more. I stand before you.

26:56.172 --> 26:58.806
Broken to your will.

27:17.109 --> 27:19.610
You can't break me.

27:30.623 --> 27:35.709
What about Paloma? Are you ready to
sacrifice another young girl to him?

27:35.794 --> 27:39.763
You were that girl once.
Where is that girl?

27:44.854 --> 27:47.888
- What's it like?
- What's what like?

27:47.973 --> 27:51.975
You know, this whole cosa nostra
 snake-vampire thing you've been doing?

27:52.061 --> 27:53.861
I mean, how does it work? You
guys all sit around a table,

27:53.979 --> 27:56.864
eatin' gabagool with a
little white mouse on top?

27:56.982 --> 27:59.983
- Swallow it whole?
- Oh, that's hilarious.

28:00.069 --> 28:03.487
It is a rich and ancient tradition
of which I'm privileged...

28:03.572 --> 28:04.988
- Oh. Oh.
- To be part of.

28:05.074 --> 28:06.907
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

28:06.992 --> 28:08.992
It's pretty big, though, isn't it?

28:09.128 --> 28:10.961
- What's big?
- Well, the operation.

28:11.046 --> 28:13.830
- Everything the Browns got going on.
- Okay, that's racist.

28:13.966 --> 28:17.251
- And we're not all brown.
- It's not my term, brother, not my term, okay?

28:17.336 --> 28:19.503
Uncle Eddie says that's what
they're called on the street.

28:19.588 --> 28:21.388
Apparently, he's been
tracking their shipments.

28:21.507 --> 28:22.923
What's he know about it?

28:23.008 --> 28:24.591
Apparently a lot.

28:26.929 --> 28:28.061
What's his play?

28:29.848 --> 28:32.349
I don't know.

28:32.434 --> 28:35.485
Come on, man, you know fading
cons, they like to dream.

28:38.107 --> 28:39.690
- What?
- I can tell when you got

28:39.775 --> 28:41.241
a stiffy for a score, brother.

28:41.360 --> 28:44.528
This is my sandbox. Stay the hell out.

28:49.418 --> 28:53.287
Sheriff.

28:53.372 --> 28:56.290
Chapel Road. Got it.

29:16.395 --> 29:18.028
Son of a bitch!

29:27.740 --> 29:31.458
Your call cannot be completed as dialed.

29:31.577 --> 29:32.939
If you feel

29:32.942 --> 29:34.463
you've reached this number in error...

29:36.081 --> 29:37.297
Please. No!

29:37.416 --> 29:39.416
Please hang up and call again.

29:39.551 --> 29:41.134
No, no!

30:13.335 --> 30:17.287
Getaway is such a silly
concept, isn't it, Carlito?

30:20.452 --> 30:22.736
Nobody ever asked you to help me, Kate.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.855
Dad did.

30:25.941 --> 30:27.607
Dad had his chance.

30:32.030 --> 30:36.783
I was so mad... when
they told me about you.

30:40.038 --> 30:42.539
You would think that I would be
excited to have a little brother.

30:42.674 --> 30:47.210
But I was eight years old, and it
was gonna be the end of my life.

30:50.299 --> 30:54.100
How dare they bring in this little kid

30:54.219 --> 30:58.021
from God knows where to
ruin my perfect family.

30:58.106 --> 31:00.440
We were pretty far from perfect.

31:00.559 --> 31:02.943
Oh, before you, we were.

31:03.061 --> 31:05.812
Dinner every night at six-thirty sharp.

31:05.897 --> 31:11.401
Sunday service at Bethel Baptist,
holding hands in the first pew.

31:11.486 --> 31:15.956
Everything had its purpose and
everything had its place.

31:16.074 --> 31:17.540
Then I came along.

31:18.827 --> 31:20.243
Yep.

31:20.379 --> 31:24.247
And you were different. And I hated that.

31:24.383 --> 31:27.000
I couldn't even say your name.

31:27.085 --> 31:28.918
JianJun.

31:29.004 --> 31:31.755
Nobody ever called me that here.

31:31.890 --> 31:34.341
I'm the reason everyone called you Scott.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.725
I was a stupid little kid.

31:40.599 --> 31:45.068
And I just... hated you.

31:46.605 --> 31:48.989
And it was a sin for me to feel that.

31:49.107 --> 31:51.107
But God forgives me.

31:51.193 --> 31:55.161
I know that God forgives
me because He is love.

31:55.280 --> 31:59.616
That love can change anyone.
It can change you, Scott.

31:59.751 --> 32:03.203
I've already been changed.

32:03.288 --> 32:05.505
I know.

32:07.292 --> 32:10.260
But what I'm trying to say is that I...

32:14.716 --> 32:16.966
I love you no matter what you are...

32:18.887 --> 32:21.721
because I love who you are.

32:21.807 --> 32:24.224
JianJun.

32:26.478 --> 32:28.645
I eat people, Kate.

32:30.482 --> 32:32.399
I know. I know.

32:32.484 --> 32:34.534
But we can...

32:34.653 --> 32:36.152
we can live with that.

32:36.288 --> 32:39.656
We have to try, right?

32:39.741 --> 32:44.411
I'm so sorry about Jessica, Kate.
I should have turned her.

32:44.496 --> 32:46.713
I was just hungry.

32:46.832 --> 32:49.132
I was so hungry.

32:55.006 --> 32:58.174
- You're bleeding.
- It'll heal.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.677
I know, but it still hurts.

33:00.812 --> 33:02.479
Hey, careful.

33:29.040 --> 33:31.624
Can you really forgive me?

33:31.710 --> 33:34.844
I'm not the one that has to forgive you.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.548
You have to forgive yourself.

34:18.223 --> 34:19.556
Ranger Gonzalez?

34:24.763 --> 34:26.846
Ranger Gonzalez. Sorry.

34:30.068 --> 34:32.601
I think I figured out
what we have to do next.

34:32.687 --> 34:35.438
- You know what they're planning?
- Not yet.

34:35.524 --> 34:39.692
Whatever this is, Kate, I
 have to try and stop it.

34:39.777 --> 34:41.995
Otherwise, I'll never see my family again.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.000
Will you help me?

34:50.789 --> 34:53.706
We both will. He's ready to talk now.

34:59.514 --> 35:01.014
- Shit.
- Scott!

35:03.351 --> 35:05.101
No, no, no, no!

35:07.806 --> 35:10.106
What did you do?

35:10.192 --> 35:12.475
I believed him.

35:27.492 --> 35:29.375
Slow down!

35:29.494 --> 35:31.494
What the hell are you doing?
Just follow 'em.

35:31.580 --> 35:34.330
You want this job for yourself? You
shouldn't have brought me along.

35:45.477 --> 35:47.176
Son of a bitch! What the hell did you do?

35:47.262 --> 35:49.095
What I had to do.

35:53.852 --> 35:55.685
You almost killed me, asshole!

35:55.770 --> 35:57.186
Get back in the truck and keep driving.

35:57.322 --> 35:58.938
No, not until he empties out the back.

35:59.024 --> 36:00.374
- Seth...
- What?

36:00.624 --> 36:02.507
You wanna know where he's
going so bad, just ask him!

36:02.626 --> 36:03.758
Hey.

36:03.844 --> 36:06.294
¿Dónde está el jefe? Huh?

36:07.931 --> 36:09.180
¿Dónde está?

36:17.858 --> 36:21.443
Sorry, bro. I guess you're gonna have to
find the boss's hideout some other way.

36:21.528 --> 36:25.146
You dick. You been packin'
a stake all this time.

36:25.232 --> 36:28.428
Well, it's not like you fanged out
and leapt to my defense, ya prick.

36:28.528 --> 36:30.740
We have no idea where this truck is going.

36:30.743 --> 36:33.323
You blew the only chance
I had to end all this.

36:37.661 --> 36:39.160
- Maybe not.
- Is that...?

36:39.296 --> 36:41.996
Just shut the fuck up. Follow my lead.

36:44.968 --> 36:48.670
- I thought we had a deal, Sheriff.
- New deal.

36:48.755 --> 36:52.257
I've had my share of lookin'
the other way for these guys.

36:52.342 --> 36:54.642
And they ain't cartels, son.

36:54.728 --> 36:59.514
They are wealthy, though, and they
gonna pay handsomely for this.

36:59.649 --> 37:04.686
Which means... I get my
own Affordable Care Act.

37:04.821 --> 37:06.855
No more Meximeds for me.

37:06.990 --> 37:10.191
Brand name prescriptions
and Cadillac health plan.

37:10.277 --> 37:12.444
- Mm.
- But as for you two,

37:12.529 --> 37:15.413
it's bullet-in-the-brain-dot-gov.

37:15.532 --> 37:18.199
- Get your partner out here.
- He's not my partner.

37:18.285 --> 37:21.252
He's my brother. Do you
even know who we are?

37:21.371 --> 37:23.872
Robbed thirty million in
bonds in that bank...

37:23.957 --> 37:25.423
Abilene.

37:25.542 --> 37:28.376
Well, I'll be a son of a bitch.

37:28.512 --> 37:31.463
- Real live Geckos.
- You do this right, you'll get medals.

37:31.548 --> 37:33.715
Maybe do shaving ads and shit.

37:33.850 --> 37:36.050
Get him out here.

37:36.136 --> 37:38.470
Richard!

37:38.555 --> 37:40.805
We can't take the truck.

37:40.891 --> 37:43.358
But the Sheriff here knows
exactly where to deliver it.

37:43.443 --> 37:45.393
You wanna hurry up? I'm not
going back to prison tonight.

37:45.479 --> 37:48.113
Not if I got something to say about it.

37:48.231 --> 37:50.982
Okay, okay, relax.

37:52.202 --> 37:53.902
That's a good boy.

37:57.908 --> 38:01.876
Okay, Richard. Tell me you can do this.

38:01.962 --> 38:03.962
I can do this.

38:04.080 --> 38:08.082
Hurry up. He's gettin' away.

38:12.335 --> 38:16.338
Tell me, when you shared my
vision, how did it feel?

38:16.457 --> 38:18.373
To walk in the sun?

38:18.829 --> 38:20.662
You remember who that girl was?

38:22.049 --> 38:26.668
I think her very name... meant sun.

38:26.803 --> 38:28.386
What was her name?

38:28.505 --> 38:30.338
Kisa.

38:32.843 --> 38:34.246
_

38:37.347 --> 38:41.399
I know how it was for you in the Labyrinth.

38:41.518 --> 38:44.319
I lost something, too, in my prison.

38:44.404 --> 38:45.604
What was that?

38:54.748 --> 38:56.164
Myself.

39:00.871 --> 39:03.505
He took everything from me.

39:03.590 --> 39:05.840
You know what that means, Carlitos?

39:05.926 --> 39:07.626
What does it mean, mi diosa?

39:09.796 --> 39:13.298
It means I have nothing left to lose.

40:29.343 --> 40:31.343
Maybe we can make an arrangement.

40:31.461 --> 40:34.596
I don't make arrangements.

40:34.681 --> 40:36.097
I regulate.

40:50.814 --> 40:52.364
He did it.

40:52.482 --> 40:54.482
He's a made man.

40:57.037 --> 40:58.653
Ranger Gonzalez.

41:01.408 --> 41:04.876
Those weapons. The ones that you made.

41:06.830 --> 41:09.831
You're gonna teach me how to use them.

41:09.966 --> 41:12.250
Sure that's what you want?

41:12.335 --> 41:15.003
He has made his choice.

41:15.138 --> 41:17.756
And the next time that I see him,

41:17.841 --> 41:20.091
I'm gonna make mine.

41:47.871 --> 41:49.337
There he is.

42:02.385 --> 42:04.102
Ain't that somethin'.

42:04.221 --> 42:06.271
I thought the big man was
operating south of the Border.

42:06.389 --> 42:08.556
Rich and ancient tradition, brother.

42:08.692 --> 42:10.725
Borders mean nothing to us.

42:17.818 --> 42:20.568
Richard! We can't take the truck.

42:20.704 --> 42:23.788
But the Sheriff here knows
exactly where to deliver it.

42:48.982 --> 42:51.733
These are some kinda digs.

42:56.156 --> 42:59.607
It's where I like to keep my treasures.

42:59.743 --> 43:02.076
I'm honored to be sharing
some of them with you.

43:03.947 --> 43:06.698
I didn't see the cargo.

43:06.783 --> 43:09.667
Is it all right?

43:09.786 --> 43:12.704
It's just like I expected.

43:16.793 --> 43:18.960
My enemies will be coming for me.

43:19.095 --> 43:22.463
I want to know everything about them.

43:30.891 --> 43:35.727
So, uh... what are you
gonna do to those boys?

43:35.812 --> 43:39.364
I have to decide. You know what they say...

43:39.482 --> 43:42.283
There's more than one way to skin a Gecko.
