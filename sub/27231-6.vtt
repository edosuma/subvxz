Previously on "All Stars"...

00:02.135 --> 00:06.673
Jasmine, you are
and will always be an All Star.

00:06.673 --> 00:09.676
Yes! You have not seen
the last of me yet.

00:09.676 --> 00:11.745
[laughs]

00:12.779 --> 00:15.349
Farrah Moan, sashay away.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.317
Bye, guys.
I really didn't think

00:17.317 --> 00:20.787
that Valentina
was going to send me home.

00:20.787 --> 00:21.922
My dear Gia.

00:21.922 --> 00:23.957
I would have liked
to continue.

00:23.957 --> 00:26.593
I know that I have something
to offer this world.

00:26.593 --> 00:28.829
I am an All Star.

00:28.829 --> 00:31.932
Latrice Royale, sashay away.

00:31.932 --> 00:33.500
Everything happens
for a reason.

00:33.500 --> 00:35.736
There's something bigger
and better waiting for me.

00:35.736 --> 00:38.538
Always large and in charge,
bold and beautiful,

00:38.538 --> 00:41.341
and this is not the end of me,
darling.

00:41.341 --> 00:44.177
Manila Luzon,
you're a winner, baby.

00:44.177 --> 00:48.282
Monét X Change,
you're also a winner, baby.

00:48.282 --> 00:50.384
Are we sending two girls home?

00:50.384 --> 00:56.390
For tonight, "All Star"
rules are suspended.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.725
No one is going home.

01:06.333 --> 01:07.534

01:07.534 --> 01:08.568

- Aah!

01:08.568 --> 01:11.138
Look behind you.

01:12.973 --> 01:16.543
I have died and gone to hell.

You look like a sexy-ass ho.

- Yes!

01:57.384 --> 01:58.652
Goop.

01:58.652 --> 02:01.488
The slime has just hit us,
America.

02:01.488 --> 02:03.657
We've got all these girls back.

02:03.657 --> 02:04.925
Great.

02:04.925 --> 02:06.760
There's a twist in the game.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.962
We've arisen from the dead.

02:08.962 --> 02:12.833
RuPaul actually told us
we are going to have a chance

02:12.833 --> 02:14.835
at coming back
into the competition.

02:14.835 --> 02:16.603
- Oh, really?
- Stunning.

02:16.603 --> 02:17.771
Yay.

02:19.139 --> 02:20.674
The message on the mirror

02:20.674 --> 02:25.979
says "Get ready to lip sync for
your life, life, life, life."

02:25.979 --> 02:28.515
What does this message mean?
We don't know.

02:28.515 --> 02:31.284
Miss Monique don't look like
she missed any none of us.

02:31.284 --> 02:35.922
She said, "I could have done
without those dead whores."

02:35.922 --> 02:37.657
No one knows what to think.

02:37.657 --> 02:39.960
Not all is revealed yet.

02:39.960 --> 02:42.496
I'm clutching my pearls,
bitch. [gasps]

02:42.496 --> 02:44.664
- This is not okay.
- What's not okay?

02:44.664 --> 02:47.501
There's 10 people
back in the competition.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.469
No, ma'am.

02:49.469 --> 02:51.872
So if you are not shaking
in your boots right now--

02:51.872 --> 02:53.874
Oh, I'm shaking.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.108
You better.

02:55.108 --> 02:56.910
Like we're all the way back
at the beginning.

02:56.910 --> 02:59.546
These bitches have gotta go.

02:59.546 --> 03:00.814
Miss Jasmine Masters,
Miss Juj.

03:00.814 --> 03:03.016
What's the gig?
Hey, juj.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.818
Do you feel any type of way
about going home?

03:04.818 --> 03:06.119
Oh, no, not at all.

03:06.119 --> 03:07.354
What would you do differently?

03:07.354 --> 03:08.488
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

03:08.488 --> 03:09.823
- No.
- Not even like kind of try

03:09.823 --> 03:11.992
to prepare a standup
comedy routine

03:11.992 --> 03:13.160
and know a little bit more?

03:13.160 --> 03:14.628
Probably just like you
a little bit more.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.463
Like a little bit more.
Okay.

03:16.463 --> 03:18.665
The girls aren't happy,
but, oh, well.

03:18.665 --> 03:20.333
I am back in the house, bitch.

03:20.333 --> 03:22.502
[laughs]

03:22.502 --> 03:24.271
Nobody knows
what's going to happen

03:24.271 --> 03:26.973
with this message
Ru has put on the mirror,

03:26.973 --> 03:29.509
and I'm not budging
until I'm crowned up.

03:29.509 --> 03:31.378
[laughs]

03:31.378 --> 03:34.548
Bitch, pause with a quick,
you look incredible.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.316
- Oh, thank you.
- You really do.

03:36.316 --> 03:37.484
How do you feel?

03:37.484 --> 03:38.885
I mean, I definitely feel

03:38.885 --> 03:40.554
like it was really devastating

03:40.554 --> 03:42.889
for me to go home when I did.

03:42.889 --> 03:47.160
I invested everything that I had
into this competition,

03:47.160 --> 03:50.831
so to not get to show
what I'm capable of,

03:50.831 --> 03:53.300
that is just
so heartbreaking to me.

03:53.300 --> 03:56.103
But, you know, I'd love
to congratulate Valentina,

03:56.103 --> 04:00.006
because she got to have, you
know, her win dressed as Selena,

04:00.006 --> 04:02.008
her Ariana Grande redemption,

04:02.008 --> 04:05.145
and she got to send Farrah Moan
home, so that was like...

04:05.145 --> 04:08.215
- Oh, no.
- ...her orgasm of an episode,

04:08.215 --> 04:10.283
and I'm glad
she gets to have that.

04:10.283 --> 04:11.585
Bitch, you are bitter.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.353
Bitter
is a really strong word.

04:13.353 --> 04:15.055
With everything that me
and Valentina have been through

04:15.055 --> 04:17.390
over the last few years,

04:17.390 --> 04:20.160
I just was so hoping that there
was going to be something in her

04:20.160 --> 04:21.995
that was going to have my back.

04:21.995 --> 04:25.932
I just wish it could
have been anyone else.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.868
What was the challenge?

04:27.868 --> 04:29.770
It was a roast
of Lady Bunny.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.037
We were all in the bottom.

04:31.037 --> 04:33.874
- Except me and Manila.
- Really?

04:33.874 --> 04:34.975
Who won the lip sync?

04:34.975 --> 04:36.243
Double win?

04:36.243 --> 04:38.245
- Both of us.
- Oh.

04:38.245 --> 04:39.713
What was both
of your decisions?

04:40.780 --> 04:43.216
Ooh, girl.

04:43.216 --> 04:44.951
Gather around, ladies.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.253
I made my decision

04:46.253 --> 04:49.322
based on sitting there
watching the girls perform.

04:49.322 --> 04:51.758
And I love this bitch, and she's
everything, she's sickening,

04:51.758 --> 04:53.994
but today she just
wasn't her strongest.

04:53.994 --> 04:56.096
So I had chose
to send home Valentina.

04:57.697 --> 05:01.067
Boom. Bitch number one
says Valentina.

05:01.067 --> 05:02.469
And it's nothing personal,
you know.

05:02.469 --> 05:03.737
Valentina
had been in the bottom before,

05:03.737 --> 05:05.105
Monique had been
in the bottom before,

05:05.105 --> 05:06.740
but Monique did a better job
in the roast.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.175
Manila, who did you choose?

05:08.175 --> 05:10.277
This was a really hard
decision for me,

05:10.277 --> 05:13.980
because I did not want to have
to vote any of you guys off.

05:13.980 --> 05:16.750
And I'm sad because
I love this person so much.

05:16.750 --> 05:19.786
But I also voted for Valentina.

05:19.786 --> 05:23.557
Boom. Bitch number two
says Valentina.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.826
You think this is cute,

05:25.826 --> 05:28.128
this story of let's just
get rid of the bitch?

05:28.128 --> 05:29.262
Well, you know what, bitches?

05:29.262 --> 05:31.398
I still got another
motherfucking week.

05:31.398 --> 05:33.633
What kind of jokes
did you give, Valentina?

05:33.633 --> 05:34.968
Oh, girl, I was hilarious.

05:34.968 --> 05:37.604
I was feeling
my every fantasy on that stage.

05:37.604 --> 05:39.172
And the bitches were laughing,

05:39.172 --> 05:40.307
and they were like,
"You weren't funny,"

05:40.307 --> 05:42.042
but I'm like, bitch,
"You were laughing."

05:42.042 --> 05:43.143
We must not have been
at the same roast.

05:43.143 --> 05:45.345
So somebody lying.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.013
Hello. [laughs]

05:47.013 --> 05:48.381
Lady Bunny is such a whore.

05:48.381 --> 05:50.016
Her sphincter ripped,

05:50.016 --> 05:53.153
and she's been using her
denture-less gums ever since.

05:55.522 --> 05:56.923
It just wasn't very funny.

05:58.091 --> 05:59.359
But I'm not going
off of the critiques,

05:59.359 --> 06:00.794
I'm going off of what I felt.

06:00.794 --> 06:02.929
[all laugh]

06:02.929 --> 06:04.264
I don't believe--

06:04.264 --> 06:06.333
No, I don't believe anything
the judges were saying,

06:06.333 --> 06:09.002
because I was good, girl.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.771
Let me tell you something.

06:11.771 --> 06:14.674
When it comes to me
and living in my world

06:14.674 --> 06:17.244
and this little coconut head
that I've got,

06:17.244 --> 06:19.312
it's a lot of fantasies.

06:19.312 --> 06:22.882
And when I feel the fantasy,
it is my reality,

06:22.882 --> 06:25.185
and nobody can change that.

06:25.185 --> 06:27.220
Saved by the bell.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.922
Saved by RuPaul.

06:28.922 --> 06:31.958
I wish the "nobody went home"
thing applied to my episode.

06:31.958 --> 06:33.593
[laughs]

06:33.593 --> 06:36.997
Um, let me just get this
out of the way.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.966
I'm not even like upset with
the fact that you sent me home.

06:39.966 --> 06:44.804
What bothered me was
that I can handle the truth,

06:44.804 --> 06:47.240
and I felt like

06:47.240 --> 06:50.977
when you were giving your
reasoning for sending me home,

06:50.977 --> 06:52.112
that it was disingenuous

06:52.112 --> 06:55.548
and that it wasn't
the real, whole truth.

06:55.548 --> 06:57.951
- It was.
- I just didn't get that.

06:57.951 --> 07:01.721
The person I chose,
they are sickening,

07:01.721 --> 07:05.492
they really do give you
the ooh-ah-ah sensation.

07:05.492 --> 07:08.495
I knew that
this was your friend,

07:08.495 --> 07:10.397
and at all costs, you were
going to save your friend.

07:10.397 --> 07:11.498
- Lies.
- Baby.

07:11.498 --> 07:12.866
- Lies.
- Baby.

07:12.866 --> 07:15.502
Lies.
Disingenuous?

07:15.502 --> 07:17.437
So you're making assumptions.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.707
I didn't keep Monique because
she was my Season 10 sister.

07:20.707 --> 07:22.642
I kept the bitch because she had
a better report card than you.

07:22.642 --> 07:24.044
Fact.

07:24.044 --> 07:26.980
She had a win under her belt,
where you didn't have one.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.915
And, Latrice,
I will say honestly,

07:28.915 --> 07:31.885
had I not have been in the top
and had I not been doing well,

07:31.885 --> 07:33.053
I honest to God think

07:33.053 --> 07:34.487
that Monique would have
sent me home over you.

07:34.487 --> 07:35.789
I really do believe that.

07:35.789 --> 07:38.658
I legitimately sent you home

07:38.658 --> 07:41.828
for the simple fact that
this was your third time here--

07:41.828 --> 07:44.030
Baby, we don't talk
about "All Stars" 1

07:44.030 --> 07:46.533
because that
was a shoddy situation.

07:46.533 --> 07:48.635
So it doesn't even count
in our book.

07:48.635 --> 07:51.171
This is legitimately
my second chance.

07:51.171 --> 07:52.172
You know what I'm saying?

07:52.172 --> 07:53.340
- Oh.
- Just so you know.

07:53.340 --> 07:55.575
Latrice doesn't count
"All Stars" 1.

07:55.575 --> 08:00.246
I feel that same spirit
of delusion that is on Valentina

08:00.246 --> 08:02.349
is now jumping over to her.

08:02.349 --> 08:04.884
That's why you've got to be
careful who you around, America,

08:04.884 --> 08:06.586
because that spirit of delusion,
it just--

08:06.586 --> 08:09.322
y'all might have to bind
and rebuke it.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.091
I was just trying to play fair.

08:11.091 --> 08:12.759
There was nothing shady
under my belt.

08:12.759 --> 08:14.561
Like I said, I don't have
any hard feelings,

08:14.561 --> 08:16.096
and I'm definitely not mad.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.263
Because guess what?

08:17.263 --> 08:18.398
- You're back.
- There you go.

08:18.398 --> 08:20.467
- Stunning.
- And I'm about to be seen.

08:20.467 --> 08:21.601
I'm gonna be falling out,

08:21.601 --> 08:23.670
jumping up
and doing jumping jacks,

08:23.670 --> 08:26.206
high kicks, whatever
the fuck I need to do

08:26.206 --> 08:28.341
to make sure
that I'm here to the end.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.676
Let the games begin.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.077
Hallelujah.

08:31.077 --> 08:32.479
[all laugh]

08:32.479 --> 08:33.613
Am I going back
to my old apartment?

08:33.613 --> 08:36.416
Ooh, girl.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.651
It just got fierce up in here.

08:38.651 --> 08:39.652
Now don't get it twisted.

08:39.652 --> 08:42.856
I have no hard feelings
towards Monique.

08:42.856 --> 08:46.026
However, you did what you did,

08:46.026 --> 08:49.996
so I'm trying to show you
what mama's made of.

08:49.996 --> 08:51.798
Well, they always come back
with something to prove.

08:51.798 --> 08:53.299
That's the thing.

08:53.299 --> 08:57.003
Let it be known Latrice
motherfucking Royale is back,

08:57.003 --> 08:59.506
and she's here
to win this crown.

08:59.506 --> 09:02.776
America, okay?
Very that.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.446
Love you. Mean it.

09:09.115 --> 09:11.618
Bitch, I'm back. Yes, bitch.

09:11.618 --> 09:12.952
- I'm back!
- Yeah, jam.

09:12.952 --> 09:16.022
[cheers and laughter]

09:16.022 --> 09:17.724
Most people don't know this,

09:17.724 --> 09:20.894
but hidden
deep behind the tuck,

09:20.894 --> 09:24.831
there's a big, throbbing heart.

09:24.831 --> 09:26.533
Does it smell different?

09:26.533 --> 09:29.369
Does it smell like drag?
[laughs]

09:29.369 --> 09:31.304
And this morning,
she's so full...

09:32.705 --> 09:33.840
Prickle.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.742
...of questions.

09:35.742 --> 09:36.943
You seem bothered.

09:36.943 --> 09:38.278
I want to know
what's going on in your brain.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.146
[all laugh]

09:40.146 --> 09:41.948
Why are these bitches here?

09:41.948 --> 09:43.383
Why?

09:43.383 --> 09:44.584
Girl, I'm not bothered.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.419
- Okay.
- I'm fine.

09:46.419 --> 09:47.921
[imitating Trinity]
I'm fine.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.456
The thing is, is Gia,

09:49.456 --> 09:52.759
you're back to do
exactly what you do best.

09:52.759 --> 09:53.893
[all laugh]

09:53.893 --> 09:55.261
I just know--

09:55.261 --> 09:57.330
You are back to do
just what you do best.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.865
I am not bothered.

09:58.865 --> 10:00.300
I'm here, I'm confident,

10:00.300 --> 10:02.235
and I'm ready
to send you packing.

10:02.235 --> 10:04.737
So you keep on stirring, girl.

10:04.737 --> 10:07.807
Ugh, Miss Gia Gunn.

10:07.807 --> 10:10.710
She showed me
what kind of person she is.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.445
And now that
I actually have a chance

10:12.445 --> 10:14.047
to return
back to the competition,

10:14.047 --> 10:16.483
I'm just going to keep
a comfortable distance.

10:16.483 --> 10:19.486
The rules are about to change.

10:19.486 --> 10:21.688
- They are suspended.
- What does that mean?

10:21.688 --> 10:23.823
That means that
the way we was doing it,

10:23.823 --> 10:25.792
we were fucking it up,
and they ain't having it.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.794
- Was it?
- Clearly.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.662
- [all laugh]
- That's you.

10:29.662 --> 10:31.698
[all laugh]

10:31.698 --> 10:33.500
I'm just waiting for the gag.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.702
I'm ready to see
what we are doing.

10:35.702 --> 10:36.903
- Very that.
- Yeah, yeah.

10:36.903 --> 10:38.605
[alarm]
Ooh.

10:38.605 --> 10:40.974
- We about to find out.
- Ooh, girl.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.643
She done already
done had herses.

10:43.643 --> 10:48.281
My queens, join me
in a relaxing meditation.

10:48.281 --> 10:50.750
[inhales]
Take a deep breath.

10:50.750 --> 10:52.485
Mm.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.921
Now, look at the queen
to your right.

10:56.055 --> 10:58.992
And now, the queen to your left.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.593
Because after this week,

11:00.593 --> 11:02.695
ooh, child,

11:02.695 --> 11:06.699
everything
is gonna change forever.

11:06.699 --> 11:08.935
What?

11:08.935 --> 11:10.336
I feel better already.

11:10.336 --> 11:11.437
How about you?

11:11.437 --> 11:14.674
But why?

11:14.674 --> 11:16.476
Hello, hello, hello.

11:16.476 --> 11:19.379
[cheers and applause]

11:19.379 --> 11:20.613
Love your hat.

11:20.613 --> 11:22.882
Ladies, as I told you
last week,

11:22.882 --> 11:26.452
"All Star" rules have been
suspended temporarily.

11:26.452 --> 11:28.221
[drum roll]

11:28.221 --> 11:29.856
Now, everyone loves a comeback,

11:29.856 --> 11:33.893
so today, for the first time
in "Drag Race" herstory,

11:33.893 --> 11:39.432
we're having
a Lip Sync LalapaRuza.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.134
- All right.
- What does that mean?

11:41.134 --> 11:43.236
In reverse elimination order,

11:43.236 --> 11:45.538
starting with Latrice, then Gia,

11:45.538 --> 11:48.575
then Farrah, and then Jasmine,

11:48.575 --> 11:52.478
each of you gets to choose
which current All Star

11:52.478 --> 11:54.614
you think you can take down

11:54.614 --> 11:57.951
in a lip sync for your life
to one of my hit songs.

11:59.085 --> 12:00.587
What privilege.

12:00.587 --> 12:02.355
#AllStars4.

12:02.355 --> 12:03.656
I am so gagged.

12:03.656 --> 12:06.326
Now, if the eliminated
queen wins,

12:06.326 --> 12:09.028
she reenters the competition

12:09.028 --> 12:13.266
and sends the current
All Star home.

12:13.266 --> 12:15.535
Shaking in the boots.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.770
Girl, gag.

12:19.038 --> 12:20.773
Oh, and there's
one more thing.

12:20.773 --> 12:23.209
Manila Luzon, Monét X Change.

12:23.209 --> 12:24.477
What? What?

12:24.477 --> 12:26.980
Because you were
the top two queens last week,

12:26.980 --> 12:29.749
you have immunity this week.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.884
- Yes!
- Thank you, girl!

12:33.152 --> 12:34.587
Hallelujah.

12:34.587 --> 12:35.722
Monét. [laughs]

12:35.722 --> 12:37.390
Bitch, the right week.

12:37.390 --> 12:39.559
And tonight on the runway,

12:39.559 --> 12:43.096
category is
LalapaRuza Eleganza.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.731
Oh.

12:44.731 --> 12:47.934
Well, I'm sure you all have
a lot to talk about.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.469
- Oh, we sure do.
- This is--

12:49.469 --> 12:51.337
Can you shut up?
You're safe.

12:51.337 --> 12:54.273
I'll see you
on the main stage.

12:54.273 --> 12:58.211
Ladies and gentlemen,
start your engines,

12:58.211 --> 13:00.780
and may the best All Star win.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.081
[laughs]

13:02.081 --> 13:03.149
Girl.

13:03.149 --> 13:04.717
Thank you, Ru.

13:05.752 --> 13:07.587
- Oh, my God.
- What?

13:07.587 --> 13:08.921
[all talking at once]

13:08.921 --> 13:09.922
Bitch.

13:09.922 --> 13:12.325
- Yeah.
- That was all bullshit.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.427
My stomach is in my ass.

13:14.427 --> 13:15.595
Whew.
Thank you, Lord, girl.

13:15.595 --> 13:17.296
I have immunity.
I am safe.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.265
But it is a gag.

13:19.265 --> 13:20.333
The eliminated girls

13:20.333 --> 13:21.768
can choose
any of the remaining girls

13:21.768 --> 13:23.002
to lip sync against

13:23.002 --> 13:26.139
to try to take their spot
in the competition.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.307
Girl, we can walk back
in this workroom tomorrow

13:28.307 --> 13:31.978
and there could be like
four completely new faces

13:31.978 --> 13:34.547
with me and Manila
up in here, girl. Shook.

13:34.547 --> 13:36.449
I feel on edge
and I'm not even lip syncing,

13:36.449 --> 13:38.518
so I can't even imagine
how the fuck y'all feel.

13:38.518 --> 13:39.952
What if, in some crazy world,

13:39.952 --> 13:42.822
like all the eliminated queens
send all the bottom queens home?

13:42.822 --> 13:44.090
Well, that ain't gonna happen.

13:44.090 --> 13:45.892
[all laugh]

13:45.892 --> 13:46.926
Trinity!

13:46.926 --> 13:48.795
Lip syncing is what I do,
bitch.

13:48.795 --> 13:50.563
- Trinity!
- I'm here to stay.

13:50.563 --> 13:53.433
Everybody's panties
are in a twist, honey.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.501
I can feel the tension.

13:55.501 --> 13:57.904
But if you think about it
for a second,

13:57.904 --> 14:00.540
bitch, this challenge,
it makes sense.

14:00.540 --> 14:01.841
This is what we do.

14:01.841 --> 14:05.445
I'm talking about Drag Queen 101
right here, honey,

14:05.445 --> 14:07.013
and if you can't slay
a lip sync,

14:07.013 --> 14:09.115
you don't deserve to be here.

14:11.250 --> 14:15.421
I did want to talk with you,
just because out of like respect

14:15.421 --> 14:20.126
and out of like just hope
that we're still cool.

14:20.126 --> 14:21.294
Yeah.

14:21.294 --> 14:23.629
Because of me and my decision,

14:23.629 --> 14:26.566
you're no longer
one of the current queens here.

14:26.566 --> 14:30.303
I think it'd be really awkward
for Farrah to be back,

14:30.303 --> 14:32.839
and to just like ignore
the elephant in the room

14:32.839 --> 14:34.307
that I sent her ass home.

14:34.307 --> 14:37.410
And just, "Hi, how are you?

14:37.410 --> 14:38.878
You're back.
Are you happy?"

14:38.878 --> 14:41.047
Like, I don't want
to be that girl.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.381
How are we?
Where are we?

14:42.381 --> 14:44.784
Do we touch base on this later?

14:44.784 --> 14:46.786
Do you feel everything's
too new, too raw, or--

14:46.786 --> 14:50.823
I want to know 100%
did you really feel like--

14:50.823 --> 14:53.459
you watched the performance--
did you really feel like

14:53.459 --> 14:55.595
based on the runway
and based on the performance,

14:55.595 --> 14:59.132
that I was the complete worst
of the entire episode?

14:59.132 --> 15:00.666
- Yeah.
- Really?

15:00.666 --> 15:01.934
Yeah.

15:01.934 --> 15:04.137
Wow.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.739
I have been told
for a lot of my career

15:06.739 --> 15:09.575
that I don't have any talent.

15:09.575 --> 15:11.644
So when Valentina tells me

15:11.644 --> 15:14.480
that she genuinely felt
like I was the worst,

15:14.480 --> 15:18.050
someone who I thought
really, truly believed in me,

15:18.050 --> 15:21.287
my heart just...shattered.

15:21.287 --> 15:24.791
Even if you do have
hurt feelings towards me,

15:24.791 --> 15:27.827
I respect that,
and trust me, I understand.

15:27.827 --> 15:31.330
And you have the opportunity
to get rid of me if you want.

15:31.330 --> 15:33.800
Do what you gotta do.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.335
I'm not the kind of person
that holds grudges,

15:36.335 --> 15:39.939
but right now,
it's just such a fresh wound

15:39.939 --> 15:42.775
that part of me thinks
it would feel really good

15:42.775 --> 15:46.212
to lip sync against Valentina
and send her ass home.

15:46.212 --> 15:47.713
I'm just gonna let you
get ready

15:47.713 --> 15:52.218
and/or allow you to just process
and feel your feelings.

15:52.218 --> 15:54.754
I think Latrice
is going to pick me.

15:54.754 --> 15:56.689
You think so?

15:56.689 --> 15:57.924
- For sure.
- Why do you think so?

15:57.924 --> 15:59.158
Because she came back
real spicy.

15:59.158 --> 16:00.193
She did.

16:00.193 --> 16:03.763
I sent Latrice home
for valid reasons.

16:03.763 --> 16:07.233
Sister Latrice felt like
it was disingenuine,

16:07.233 --> 16:11.270
so basically questioning
my character and integrity.

16:11.270 --> 16:13.940
And she had things to say
about you eliminating her

16:13.940 --> 16:15.808
that were so outlandish,
in my opinion.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.977
That was--right.
It doesn't make any sense.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.947
The reality is you've
had three seasons, sitch.

16:20.947 --> 16:22.348
You have tons of fans.

16:22.348 --> 16:24.116
You've been traveling the world.

16:24.116 --> 16:26.285
But you still giving
the same pageant drag

16:26.285 --> 16:28.020
that you was giving
on Season 4,

16:28.020 --> 16:30.189
and that's why you got chopped.

16:30.189 --> 16:32.859
I feel it,
but if so, I'm ready.

16:32.859 --> 16:34.160
Let's go.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.361
But you know what?

16:35.361 --> 16:37.797
If I could choose,
I would choose Latrice.

16:37.797 --> 16:40.566
That's the one I would want,
'cause I'm annoyed.

16:40.566 --> 16:45.004
Like, if she's feeling some
type of way, boop, let's go.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.807
Honey, I'm from New York.
I live in KC.

16:47.807 --> 16:49.542
But I'm about them streets,

16:49.542 --> 16:51.611
and I'm about that life,
so it's good.

16:55.982 --> 16:58.150
All I know is this.

16:58.150 --> 16:59.585
I'm not scared of none of y'all.
You understand me?

16:59.585 --> 17:02.321
I mean, I get you,
but I'm also not scared.

17:02.321 --> 17:04.790
- And you shouldn't be.
- Because I'm a performer.

17:04.790 --> 17:05.925
That's what I do.

17:05.925 --> 17:06.959
That's the point.
That's what you do.

17:06.959 --> 17:09.028
And I got some tricks
up my sleeve.

17:09.028 --> 17:12.098
- You got tricks up your butt.
- [all laugh]

17:12.098 --> 17:16.002
Today's maxi challenge
is a Lip Sync LalapaRuza.

17:16.002 --> 17:18.304
The four queens
that were eliminated

17:18.304 --> 17:19.572
are about to lip sync

17:19.572 --> 17:21.908
against four queens that
are still in the competition

17:21.908 --> 17:24.076
to try to take our spots
in the game.

17:24.076 --> 17:26.279
You don't think
they're nervous.

17:26.279 --> 17:27.947
I think they're shaking
in their boots.

17:27.947 --> 17:29.415
- All of them.
- I think everyone is.

17:29.415 --> 17:32.018
I'm not--I'm not--I really
am not--honestly, I'm not.

17:32.018 --> 17:33.019
No, I'll be honest.

17:33.019 --> 17:34.020
I think you are
a little nervous.

17:34.020 --> 17:35.054
- No, she's not.
- I'm not.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.222
You keep saying that, girl.

17:36.222 --> 17:37.490
That's not going to be
my narrative,

17:37.490 --> 17:39.091
because that's not
how I feel, Gia.

17:39.091 --> 17:41.060
Okay, but that doesn't
take away from the fact

17:41.060 --> 17:42.828
that I still think
that you're nervous.

17:42.828 --> 17:46.098
Well, then you can think that,
but that don't make it reality.

17:46.098 --> 17:47.733
Now, Trinity is not saying it,

17:47.733 --> 17:51.103
but I see Trinity
the most nervous.

17:51.103 --> 17:54.674
And I'm thinking maybe
I want to go for her,

17:54.674 --> 17:58.244
because even though Trinity
is a fierce performer,

17:58.244 --> 18:00.913
right now she is shaky.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.315
I'm not gonna get nervous.

18:02.315 --> 18:04.150
I'm not going to be
in my head about it.

18:04.150 --> 18:05.952
I'm gonna do
what I know how to do,

18:05.952 --> 18:08.421
which is what I do the best,
is perform.

18:08.421 --> 18:09.956
At this point
in the competition,

18:09.956 --> 18:11.657
I am one of the frontrunners.

18:11.657 --> 18:14.927
So, girl, you trying to get
in my head ain't gonna work.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.696
You ain't gonna shake me, boo.

18:16.696 --> 18:19.432
Poof, be gone.

18:19.432 --> 18:22.501
The one thing I know how to do
is do this assignment.

18:22.501 --> 18:23.903
Is perform, yep.

18:23.903 --> 18:26.672
Yes. And I know that you will
complete this assignment.

18:26.672 --> 18:29.809
Bitch, with flying colors.

18:29.809 --> 18:34.780
The fact that I almost lost
this opportunity again

18:34.780 --> 18:38.784
has lit the fire
profusely on this ass.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.252
Do you have an idea
of who you're going to choose?

18:40.252 --> 18:41.454
I do have an idea, but--

18:41.454 --> 18:43.923
[all laugh]

18:43.923 --> 18:46.058
Oh, I think
I have an idea, too.

18:46.058 --> 18:49.695
Because I was
the last queen eliminated,

18:49.695 --> 18:50.696
I get first pick.

18:53.699 --> 18:55.101
That's power.

18:55.101 --> 18:58.404
I get to make
the conscious decision

18:58.404 --> 19:02.408
whether I'm going to finish
my unfinished business

19:02.408 --> 19:04.677
or wreck some other queen.

19:04.677 --> 19:06.846
There is a certain part
of my ego

19:06.846 --> 19:09.281
that is a little crushed.

19:09.281 --> 19:10.483
Yeah.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.251
Because I feel like,
oh, bitch, no, ma'am.

19:12.251 --> 19:14.086
No, oh, no, ma'am.

19:14.086 --> 19:15.354
What do you mean

19:15.354 --> 19:16.455
about like about how
you were like eliminated?

19:16.455 --> 19:17.757
No, just the--

19:17.757 --> 19:20.926
The circumstances of who
had the power to eliminate me.

19:20.926 --> 19:22.461
And that's just being real.

19:22.461 --> 19:24.630
I ain't even gonna lie,
because bitches here

19:24.630 --> 19:28.567
are still trying
to get at my level in life.

19:28.567 --> 19:29.902
- Get on my level, ho.
- In their careers.

19:29.902 --> 19:31.537
So it's like,
you know what I mean?

19:31.537 --> 19:33.205
I'm just being serious
and being real about it.

19:33.205 --> 19:36.308
By sending me home, Monique
might have won the battle,

19:36.308 --> 19:38.177
but I'm gonna win the war.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.845
And if you didn't want this,

19:39.845 --> 19:41.447
you shouldn't
have tussled with it.

19:42.448 --> 19:43.849
Believe that.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.117
I'm gonna let y'all
finish this conversation.

19:45.117 --> 19:47.353
- Because I--
- Oh, you getting too nervous?

19:47.353 --> 19:49.088
- No. No, girl.
- [all laugh]

19:49.088 --> 19:50.189
No, girl.

19:52.291 --> 19:55.261
We're all saying that
we're not shaking in our boots,

19:55.261 --> 19:57.463
but I feel to believe otherwise.

19:57.463 --> 19:59.265
- Oh, I'm shaking in my boots.
- Are you?

19:59.265 --> 20:01.233
Because anything's possible,
you know?

20:01.233 --> 20:03.636
Right now I'm feeling
very nervous.

20:03.636 --> 20:06.672
I have a lot on the line,

20:06.672 --> 20:09.942
and I know what these queens
are capable of.

20:09.942 --> 20:12.812
But you've gotta be fucked up
if you think

20:12.812 --> 20:16.982
I'm going to let some girl
who got sent home take my spot.

20:16.982 --> 20:18.350
Oh, hell no.

20:20.419 --> 20:23.189
You may be nervous, but
you hold it together, you know.

20:23.189 --> 20:24.557
Thank you.

20:24.557 --> 20:27.226
And I think you have
this level of confidence in you

20:27.226 --> 20:30.696
that I really, like,
wish that sometimes I had.

20:30.696 --> 20:32.231
Being a woman that does drag,

20:32.231 --> 20:33.999
like, sometimes I feel like

20:33.999 --> 20:37.536
I'm not as confident
as I should be, you know.

20:37.536 --> 20:40.639
Especially in this setting,
when you're asked to do things

20:40.639 --> 20:43.309
that you're not the most
comfortable with doing.

20:43.309 --> 20:45.244
Girl,
all the comedy challenges

20:45.244 --> 20:46.412
have been up my ass.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.514
Yeah. That's tough.

20:48.514 --> 20:49.648
It is tough.

20:49.648 --> 20:52.017
The pressure here
in this competition

20:52.017 --> 20:54.320
kind of brought me
to a confusing place.

20:54.320 --> 20:57.656
I don't feel good
about being looked at

20:57.656 --> 20:59.959
like a man dressed up
as a woman.

20:59.959 --> 21:02.061
I just want to be me.

21:02.061 --> 21:04.530
On my little break
of being eliminated,

21:04.530 --> 21:08.567
I realized that just because
I put on a wig and a costume

21:08.567 --> 21:11.237
doesn't make me any less
of a woman, you know.

21:11.237 --> 21:14.740
Even though I sometimes
had trouble with being in drag,

21:14.740 --> 21:17.877
I love drag,
and me coming back here,

21:17.877 --> 21:20.579
I'm trying to prove to myself
that trans or not,

21:20.579 --> 21:23.516
I can always be
a drag performer.

21:23.516 --> 21:25.417
You're very brave for
coming into this competition

21:25.417 --> 21:27.753
and just owning it.

21:27.753 --> 21:28.788
You know what?

21:28.788 --> 21:30.356
This is a competition
about drag,

21:30.356 --> 21:32.324
and I'm a fierce drag queen.

21:33.826 --> 21:35.294
How you doing, sis?

21:35.294 --> 21:36.629
- I'm good.
- Juj.

21:36.629 --> 21:37.997
- How you doing there?
- Juj.

21:37.997 --> 21:39.698
You ready to like
send a bitch home?

21:39.698 --> 21:41.300
I'm gonna try to, girl.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.434
Ain't no trying, bitch.

21:42.434 --> 21:44.170
Trying to get these words
in order.

21:44.170 --> 21:48.207
- Okay. Let the word use ya.
- Mm-hmm.

21:48.207 --> 21:49.475
Well, you just gotta be ready,
bitch, because like--

21:49.475 --> 21:50.509
I am.

21:50.509 --> 21:52.144
This is like
anybody's game for real.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.646
Uh-huh.

21:53.646 --> 21:54.847
Have you thought about
who you're going--

21:54.847 --> 21:55.915
Oh, no, you don't get to pick.

21:55.915 --> 21:57.383
Bitch, you just gotta just wait.

21:57.383 --> 21:58.384
I get the scraps.

21:58.384 --> 22:00.019
You get the scrap
of whoever left.

22:00.019 --> 22:00.953
I'm just ready.

22:00.953 --> 22:02.421
Because when you stay ready,

22:02.421 --> 22:03.889
you don't gotta
get ready, bitch.

22:03.889 --> 22:05.825
Since I was the first one
out the door,

22:05.825 --> 22:07.827
I'm going to be
the last one to pick a girl.

22:07.827 --> 22:10.629
But lip syncing is
a very big strength of mine.

22:10.629 --> 22:13.399
It's my livelihood,
it's what I do,

22:13.399 --> 22:15.568
and I've been in drag
longer than all of them.

22:15.568 --> 22:18.804
So expect the unexpectable.
[laughs]

22:18.804 --> 22:20.706
But it is, no shade,
it will be good

22:20.706 --> 22:22.541
to, you know, send a bitch home
that sent you home first.

22:22.541 --> 22:24.143
- Bitch.
- Don't get it twisted.

22:24.143 --> 22:26.178
- Oh, Trinity.
- Uh-huh.

22:26.178 --> 22:29.014
Oh, you always want to tap
the ass that got you down.

22:29.014 --> 22:30.549
[both laugh]

22:30.549 --> 22:33.152
The one thing we know about
you, bitch, you're old school.

22:33.152 --> 22:34.353
Oh, yeah.

22:34.353 --> 22:35.387
And you're old.

22:35.387 --> 22:37.256
- Oh!
- [laughs]

22:37.256 --> 22:38.624
Shady bitch.

22:38.624 --> 22:40.693
You older than I.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.328
- Well...
- You are that.

22:42.328 --> 22:45.798
- I am that.
- [both laugh]

22:45.798 --> 22:47.900
Farrah, how are you feeling?

22:47.900 --> 22:49.368
I'm feeling good.

22:49.368 --> 22:52.004
You know, like,
it was really hard going home,

22:52.004 --> 22:54.106
like, 'cause I just
wanted this so bad

22:54.106 --> 22:55.507
and I really felt
like I had a chance,

22:55.507 --> 22:57.643
and I put so much into it.

22:57.643 --> 23:00.646
And I couldn't help but feel
like such a failure.

23:00.646 --> 23:03.616
Yeah, you have to
remember, this is a competition.

23:03.616 --> 23:07.920
This doesn't define you as
a person or as an entertainer.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.021
You know what I mean?

23:09.021 --> 23:10.022
You're really young.

23:10.022 --> 23:12.324
Like this is just a blip
in your career.

23:12.324 --> 23:13.592
How long have you done drag?

23:13.592 --> 23:15.160
It's almost been seven years.

23:15.160 --> 23:17.997
Okay. Well, I've been
doing drag for double that.

23:17.997 --> 23:19.298
- Yeah.
- So you know what I'm saying?

23:19.298 --> 23:20.332
- It's just a blip.
- Yeah.

23:20.332 --> 23:22.434
So in another seven years--

23:22.434 --> 23:24.403
- Who knows what could happen?
- Yeah.

23:24.403 --> 23:28.707
Farrah reminds me so much of me
when I first started drag.

23:28.707 --> 23:32.311
She is a hard worker
and she's passionate,

23:32.311 --> 23:35.381
but that bitch ain't got
a lick of confidence.

23:35.381 --> 23:37.483
She's got to get
out of her own head

23:37.483 --> 23:38.517
and out of her own way.

23:38.517 --> 23:40.219
You need to believe in yourself.

23:40.219 --> 23:42.922
You know, you should just
feel proud of what you did show

23:42.922 --> 23:45.824
and what you did bring,
because you are talented, bitch.

23:45.824 --> 23:46.992
Yeah.

23:46.992 --> 23:49.595
And having a weak moment

23:49.595 --> 23:52.231
doesn't make you
less of an All Star.

23:52.231 --> 23:53.532
- You know?
- Yeah.

23:53.532 --> 23:55.067
You know, it really is
just your inner saboteur

23:55.067 --> 23:56.735
- that'll get you.
- Yeah.

23:56.735 --> 23:59.104
Trinity really just
spilled the hot T on me

23:59.104 --> 24:00.306
right this second.

24:00.306 --> 24:02.908
It's not about anyone else
believing in me at all.

24:02.908 --> 24:04.476
It's about me
believing in myself.

24:04.476 --> 24:05.878
You know, at the end of the day,

24:05.878 --> 24:09.615
like, yeah, I went home
pretty soon,

24:09.615 --> 24:10.916
but I get to have
a second chance

24:10.916 --> 24:12.785
at maybe, you know, coming back.

24:12.785 --> 24:15.621
Focus on getting ready
and slay this lip sync,

24:15.621 --> 24:17.923
because, girl, this is not over.

24:17.923 --> 24:20.292
Yeah.

24:20.292 --> 24:22.962
We really lucked out.

24:22.962 --> 24:25.531
Whew, girl.

24:25.531 --> 24:26.799
The gaggerini.

24:26.799 --> 24:27.933
Like someone could just come

24:27.933 --> 24:29.335
and take your spot
in the competition.

24:29.335 --> 24:30.803
Like the little
evil person in me

24:30.803 --> 24:32.705
was like, oh, let's just,
like, watch this.

24:32.705 --> 24:34.873
Monét and I are sitting
back here with immunity,

24:34.873 --> 24:36.575
watching these bitches sweat.

24:36.575 --> 24:37.743
I am living for this.

24:37.743 --> 24:38.944
Pass me the popcorn.

24:38.944 --> 24:41.347
Is there like a hotdog
I could eat?

24:41.347 --> 24:44.083
Yeah, this is going to be
a moment, bitch.

24:44.083 --> 24:45.384
I wonder
who they're going to pick.

24:45.384 --> 24:46.385
I know.

24:46.385 --> 24:47.419
That's going to be the gag.

24:47.419 --> 24:49.054
Okay, should we just speculate

24:49.054 --> 24:50.055
since we have
nothing else to do?

24:50.055 --> 24:51.223
- Yeah.
- Okay, so Latrice--

24:51.223 --> 24:53.392
So let's say Latrice
picks Monique.

24:53.392 --> 24:54.493
- Boom.
- Boom.

24:54.493 --> 24:58.697
Gia picks...Valentina?
Trinity?

24:58.697 --> 25:00.432
You know,
here's the deal, though.

25:00.432 --> 25:02.468
Like these girls
can pick anyone they want.

25:02.468 --> 25:04.970
I would go for someone
who I knew I could beat.

25:04.970 --> 25:08.173
But at this point, everyone
is showing how strong they are.

25:08.173 --> 25:09.675
Yeah.

25:09.675 --> 25:10.943
I'm just so relieved.

25:10.943 --> 25:12.611
I am, too.

25:12.611 --> 25:13.812
The remaining queens

25:13.812 --> 25:16.181
should be shaking
in their house-down boots,

25:16.181 --> 25:17.583
because these eliminated queens

25:17.583 --> 25:20.953
have nothing to lose
and everything to gain.

25:20.953 --> 25:24.189
I'm so happy I'm safe.

25:24.189 --> 25:26.258
Oh, my gosh,
I can't even tell you.

25:26.258 --> 25:28.961
We have front-row tickets

25:28.961 --> 25:34.800
to the most dramatic challenge
in "All Stars" history.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.573
Are you shaving over
your foundation, bitch?

25:41.573 --> 25:44.376
Yeah, because I can't really
shave like dry shave.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.545
Oh. Did they teach you that
in jail, too?

25:46.545 --> 25:48.480
- [all laugh]
- Oh, my God.

25:48.480 --> 25:50.682
- Tell me.
- She is being so shady.

25:50.682 --> 25:53.585
You know,
if I were in your position,

25:53.585 --> 25:55.921
I wouldn't fuck with me.
[all laugh]

25:55.921 --> 25:58.190
You don't got your flag
for this one, bitch.

25:58.190 --> 25:59.725
I don't need flags, baby.

25:59.725 --> 26:02.027
I don't need flags.
Have you seen me?

26:02.027 --> 26:03.729
Okay, 'cause I've seen you.

26:03.729 --> 26:04.797
Oh, shady shit.

Now, have you ever had
to lip sync for your life?

27:00.652 --> 27:02.521
I was young.
I needed the money.

27:02.521 --> 27:03.722
It wasn't my fault.

Take off your top, Coco.

one of the current All Stars

27:17.836 --> 27:20.572

[RuPaul laughs]

27:47.533 --> 27:50.168
I decided to wear a catsuit.

pretty much made itself.

52:10.227 --> 52:12.830
It is definitely not personal.

52:12.830 --> 52:14.898

59:26.096 --> 59:27.764
Club 96.

59:29.132 --> 59:32.235
We have Saturn, we have
Pluto, and we have Her-anus.

59:33.737 --> 59:35.605
Honey.

59:35.605 --> 59:37.507
This stuff drives you crazy.

59:39.109 --> 59:41.111
You haven't been
in the bottom two, Manila.

59:41.111 --> 59:42.546
So that means
if you're in the bottom,

59:42.546 --> 59:44.147
you're throwing her
under the bus.

59:45.348 --> 59:47.150
[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]
