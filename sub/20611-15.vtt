[dramatic music]

00:04.372 --> 00:10.044
*

00:10.078 --> 00:11.745
- My name is Alf Rudd.

00:11.779 --> 00:15.049
I'm a tenth-generation
master blacksmith.

00:15.083 --> 00:17.351
I have some
of the actual tools

00:17.385 --> 00:19.187
belonging to
my great-grandfather.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.822
This is Felix,
and this is Sampson.

00:21.855 --> 00:24.292
It's almost like having
a puppet show at times.

00:24.325 --> 00:26.427
You get both of them--
they kind of dance together,

00:26.460 --> 00:27.661
if you will.

00:27.695 --> 00:29.230
- My name's Jason Henderson.

00:29.263 --> 00:31.199
I'm a full-time firefighter,

00:31.232 --> 00:34.268
part-time bladesmith,
and I shoe horses also.

00:34.302 --> 00:36.137
We hand-forge all
our own shoes,

00:36.170 --> 00:37.638
so working
in the fire is something

00:37.671 --> 00:39.107
that I do every day.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.474
- My name is Francesco Muci.

00:40.508 --> 00:42.476
I am 41 years old,

00:42.510 --> 00:44.312
and I live in
St. Petersburg, Florida.

00:44.345 --> 00:47.348
Yeah, I'm Italian.

00:47.381 --> 00:50.384
I moved to the United States
because my wife's American.

00:50.418 --> 00:53.287
I used to teach
15th-century sword fighting

00:53.321 --> 00:55.123
when I was back in Italy.

00:55.156 --> 00:57.758
I used to sing also
in a band--heavy metal.

00:57.791 --> 00:59.627
I've always been into metal.
[laughs]

00:59.660 --> 01:01.262
- My name is Don Halter.

01:01.295 --> 01:03.097
I've been a Texan all my life,

01:03.131 --> 01:05.099
I plan on being a Texan
the rest of my life.

01:05.133 --> 01:07.268
I got three degrees
in nuclear engineering.

01:07.301 --> 01:09.370
I found my calling--
cleaning up

01:09.403 --> 01:11.639
radioactive material,
decontaminating stuff.

01:11.672 --> 01:13.407
We had a lot of
Homer Simpson T-shirts.

01:13.441 --> 01:15.609
[laughs]

01:15.643 --> 01:17.778
- Bladesmiths,
welcome to the Forge.

01:17.811 --> 01:19.547
You are here to demonstrate

01:19.580 --> 01:21.382
your edged-weapon-making
capabilities

01:21.415 --> 01:23.451
in front of our panel
of expert judges.

01:23.484 --> 01:25.319
Ultimately,
they're the ones that determine

01:25.353 --> 01:26.887
which of you will be
the "Forged in Fire" champion

01:26.920 --> 01:29.423
and leave here
with a check for $10,000.

01:29.457 --> 01:30.858
*

01:30.891 --> 01:33.294
ABS Mastersmith
J. Neilson.

01:33.327 --> 01:35.463
Historic weapons
re-creation specialist

01:35.496 --> 01:37.165
David Baker.

01:37.198 --> 01:38.732
Edged weapons specialist
Doug Marcaida.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.301
*

01:40.334 --> 01:41.635
All right, gentlemen,

01:41.669 --> 01:43.604
if you look down
at your anvils...

01:43.637 --> 01:45.139
there's nothing there.

01:45.173 --> 01:46.407
That's because we didn't want to

01:46.440 --> 01:47.675
provide you with just one piece

01:47.708 --> 01:49.377
of high-quality steel today.

01:49.410 --> 01:50.778
We wanted to give you options.

01:50.811 --> 01:56.450
*

01:56.484 --> 01:58.786
Your first-round challenge
is to take two or more

01:58.819 --> 02:01.222
of these steels
and combine them

02:01.255 --> 02:04.292
with powdered steel to make
a canister Damascus billet,

02:04.325 --> 02:07.461
from which
you will forge a dagger.

02:07.495 --> 02:09.830
Your dagger must include
a hidden tang.

02:09.863 --> 02:11.532
- The canister steel--

02:11.565 --> 02:12.800
I'm not afraid of it.

02:12.833 --> 02:14.602
I've just never done it.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.370
- Keep in mind
that in the second round,

02:16.404 --> 02:17.771
you'll be putting handles
on those blades

02:17.805 --> 02:19.907
to turn them into
fully functional weapons

02:19.940 --> 02:21.909
that will be tested
for strength and durability

02:21.942 --> 02:24.645
in an oil-can stab

02:24.678 --> 02:28.816
and for edge retention
in a ham stab and slice.

02:28.849 --> 02:30.884
You'll have ten minutes
to design your blades

02:30.918 --> 02:33.621
and three hours to forge them.
Good luck.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.557
Your ten-minute
design window starts now.

02:36.590 --> 02:39.293
[rock music]

02:39.327 --> 02:41.229
We haven't done daggers
in a while now.

02:41.262 --> 02:43.264
- I can't wait.
There's three of my favorite

02:43.297 --> 02:45.299
elements of knife making
in this one challenge--

02:45.333 --> 02:48.869
daggers, canister Damascus,
and a hidden tang.

02:48.902 --> 02:50.571
- I've made one dagger
in my life,

02:50.604 --> 02:52.506
and it was terrible.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.542
I'm drawing something
with a pointy end

02:54.575 --> 02:56.677
and a makeshift handle,
and then I'll forge it out,

02:56.710 --> 02:58.646
and hopefully it looks
better than the drawing.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.248
I can't draw.

03:00.281 --> 03:01.915
No, I've never drawn a blade.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.884
*

03:03.917 --> 03:07.988
- My design is
a 16th-century kind of blade.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.891
I have made a few daggers.

03:10.924 --> 03:13.527
I'm trying to keep it
really simple.

03:13.561 --> 03:16.230
With $10,000,
I would like

03:16.264 --> 03:18.332
a professional
espresso machine...

03:18.366 --> 03:19.300
of course.

03:19.333 --> 03:21.302
*

03:21.335 --> 03:22.870
- I keep my blades primitive,

03:22.903 --> 03:26.274
and I try to stay within
the 19th century.

03:26.307 --> 03:28.376
The dagger has one intention.

03:28.409 --> 03:30.611
It's not used to chop firewood
or cut a piece of meat.

03:30.644 --> 03:31.812
It's made to kill.

03:31.845 --> 03:35.015
*

03:35.048 --> 03:37.485
- The overall design
I chose for my knife--

03:37.518 --> 03:39.019
what they call
a "gothic dagger,"

03:39.052 --> 03:40.888
kind of a cruciform dagger.

03:40.921 --> 03:43.291
The blade and
the guard form a cross.

03:43.324 --> 03:46.594
What got me excited
about radioactive material

03:46.627 --> 03:48.762
was Godzilla movies
in high school.

03:48.796 --> 03:50.998
I'm totally serious.
[laughs]

03:51.031 --> 03:53.033
- Your design window
is now closed.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.569
Your three-hour
forge time starts...

03:55.603 --> 03:56.704
now.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.907
*

03:59.940 --> 04:01.775
- I choose
the upright canister--

04:01.809 --> 04:03.444
it's very easy to fill.

04:03.477 --> 04:07.581
And I grab a pair of jars
of ball bearings.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.583
Nice thing is,
a bearing's round,

04:09.617 --> 04:10.984
so it's fairly easy to tap
the powder

04:11.018 --> 04:12.986
and get it to fall down
along the sides.

04:13.020 --> 04:15.756
And then I'm thinking fishhooks
are a pretty good bet.

04:15.789 --> 04:17.425
- Canister Damascus--

04:17.458 --> 04:19.793
what things
absolutely must be done

04:19.827 --> 04:21.762
in order for this to work out?

04:21.795 --> 04:23.531
- You want to see these guys
filling their material

04:23.564 --> 04:25.899
up to the brim,
pouring the powder in,

04:25.933 --> 04:28.602
and then tapping that can
and sift all that powder down.

04:28.636 --> 04:29.770
You don't want any gaps.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.472
*

04:31.505 --> 04:33.407
- I dump in
an entire bottle

04:33.441 --> 04:35.409
of Liquid Paper,
and I start rolling it around

04:35.443 --> 04:36.844
on the inside.

04:36.877 --> 04:38.712
- The chemicals in Liquid Paper

04:38.746 --> 04:40.548
keep the outside canister steel

04:40.581 --> 04:42.750
from welding
to the interior steel.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.485
- One thing
that concerns me--

04:44.518 --> 04:46.587
they're pouring
that Liquid Paper in,

04:46.620 --> 04:48.322
and they're not
letting it dry.

04:48.356 --> 04:49.790
They're just dumping
their materials in.

04:49.823 --> 04:53.961
- So, if you get Liquid Paper
on your steels

04:53.994 --> 04:56.864
that you're adding to the can,
those pieces of steel

04:56.897 --> 04:58.499
might not bind either.
- Right.

04:58.532 --> 05:01.068
*

05:01.101 --> 05:03.671
- Let's just clarify that
all of these small bits

05:03.704 --> 05:06.039
of steels are hardenable steel.
- Oh, yeah.

05:06.073 --> 05:08.509
- Except the canister.
- Except for the can itself.

05:08.542 --> 05:13.714
*

05:13.747 --> 05:16.750
Alf has just shoved one of those
canisters into the forge.

05:16.784 --> 05:18.085
There's nothing in it.

05:18.118 --> 05:19.687
It's an empty can.
What's going on?

05:19.720 --> 05:22.923
- He's letting that scale
build up.

05:22.956 --> 05:25.559
- The mill scale is
not weldable.

05:25.593 --> 05:27.795
Junk, if you will.
It doesn't stick.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.598
It creates
a non-bonding surface.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.933
So I could certainly use it
to my advantage

05:32.966 --> 05:34.868
to be able to peel
the canister off

05:34.902 --> 05:37.638
that much easier
and protect it a second time

05:37.671 --> 05:39.640
with Wite-Out.

05:39.673 --> 05:42.910
Hopefully it'll give me
a double-edged sword, in a way.

05:42.943 --> 05:45.679
It'll make it that much easier
to get off of there.

05:45.713 --> 05:47.815
- We've got, like,
some sort of a chemical spill

05:47.848 --> 05:49.783
going on at Alf's work station
over here.

05:49.817 --> 05:51.485
He's over there
like Jackson Pollock

05:51.519 --> 05:53.554
with the Liquid Paper--

05:53.587 --> 05:55.088
just swinging it everywhere.
- It's all over the place.

05:55.122 --> 05:57.491
- I use 1095 steel--

05:57.525 --> 05:59.660
little chips of this,
that, and the other thing.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.695
I don't make mistakes.

06:01.729 --> 06:02.863
I get everything right

06:02.896 --> 06:04.465
first time, every time.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.767
I have no weaknesses.
None.

06:06.800 --> 06:11.038
*

06:11.071 --> 06:14.575
- I haven't worked with
canister Damascus very much,

06:14.608 --> 06:16.143
but I've done it a few times.

06:16.176 --> 06:18.045
I really enjoy it.

06:18.078 --> 06:20.881
- Francesco's grabbed some
of the race bearing parts

06:20.914 --> 06:22.616
and ball bearings.

06:22.650 --> 06:24.184
- I'd like to put
some fishhooks inside,

06:24.217 --> 06:26.587
just to have
a neat design in it.

06:26.620 --> 06:27.688
[chuckles]

06:27.721 --> 06:29.089
- And he's opting

06:29.122 --> 06:30.791
for the canoe canister...
- Yeah.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.159
- As opposed to
the vertical canister.

06:32.192 --> 06:33.927
The advantage
with the canoe canister,

06:33.961 --> 06:35.863
is if you want to set
a certain pattern,

06:35.896 --> 06:37.665
as opposed to when
you do a top-feed,

06:37.698 --> 06:39.533
you're gonna kind of
get what you get.

06:39.567 --> 06:41.602
- I would like to
have the canister weld

06:41.635 --> 06:43.537
within the first hour.

06:43.571 --> 06:46.774
After that, everything will
fall in place, hopefully.

06:46.807 --> 06:49.510
[humming tune]

06:49.543 --> 06:51.078
*

06:51.111 --> 06:54.448
- I've never done
canister Damascus before.

06:54.482 --> 06:57.117
I put in ball bearings,
pieces of 1095.

06:57.150 --> 06:59.186
I'm just watching my steel,

06:59.219 --> 07:01.221
waiting on it to heat up
to the right temperature.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.956
I'm thinking,
"Oh, crap.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.692
Is this gonna go
the right way?"

07:04.725 --> 07:06.059
And then I look at it,
and I think,

07:06.093 --> 07:07.595
"Oh, great.
It looks good."

07:07.628 --> 07:09.897
And then I go back to,
"Oh, crap.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.532
Is this going the right way?"
[chuckles]

07:11.565 --> 07:13.501
*

07:13.534 --> 07:15.235
- One hour has elapsed!

07:15.268 --> 07:17.605
You have just
two hours remaining

07:17.638 --> 07:19.607
to finish your daggers!

07:19.640 --> 07:21.542
- I've done
three welding passes.

07:21.575 --> 07:24.545
So now I'm gonna start trying
to rip the canister

07:24.578 --> 07:26.980
off that billet.

07:27.014 --> 07:28.749
- John's having
a hell of a time

07:28.782 --> 07:30.651
getting this canister
off of his billet.

07:30.684 --> 07:33.220
- Oh, it can be a brutal task.

07:33.253 --> 07:34.988
- [bleep].

07:35.022 --> 07:36.524
- Go to the chop saw.

07:36.557 --> 07:38.091
Just cut one end off
on the chop saw.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.126
- Cut both ends off.
That's what I'd do.

07:39.159 --> 07:40.528
- Both ends off.

07:40.561 --> 07:41.895
- I'm a little concerned now,

07:41.929 --> 07:43.564
'cause I see a lot
of ball bearings

07:43.597 --> 07:45.733
that look like they didn't
get welded.

07:45.766 --> 07:47.735
I thought I had it more than hot
enough to get it welded, but...

07:47.768 --> 07:49.202
Hopefully, they're stuck enough
that if I need to,

07:49.236 --> 07:51.539
I can heat it back up
and press it into a bar.

07:51.572 --> 07:54.542
*

07:54.575 --> 07:56.877
- Look at Alf's technique--
two hammers.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.245
- You know what?
It's working, though.

07:58.278 --> 08:00.013
- It's working.

08:00.047 --> 08:02.182
- Or maybe Lady Luck
is shining down on Alf

08:02.215 --> 08:06.019
because she likes
those arm garters.

08:06.053 --> 08:08.121
- Yeah, you didn't get it.
- Well, he's looking in there,

08:08.155 --> 08:09.890
and it doesn't look
like he's happy.

08:09.923 --> 08:11.725
- What I discovered is

08:11.759 --> 08:14.562
about a third of it's
loose in there

08:14.595 --> 08:16.296
and just did not get welded.

08:16.329 --> 08:17.931
*

08:17.965 --> 08:19.733
But I'm confident

08:19.767 --> 08:21.669
that I can get this thing
welded together,

08:21.702 --> 08:23.236
and I'm gonna do that,

08:23.270 --> 08:25.005
because there's more
than one way

08:25.038 --> 08:27.675
to skin a cat,
as some people say.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.610
Except I never skinned a cat.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.178
But there's more than one way
to do it.

08:31.211 --> 08:32.580
I couldn't tell you.

08:32.613 --> 08:35.549
*

08:35.583 --> 08:37.117
- It's time
to open the billet.

08:37.150 --> 08:39.019
I go to cutting
the corners off of it,

08:39.052 --> 08:42.122
and it's not cutting it off
like I expected it to.

08:42.155 --> 08:44.224
It's not nearly as easy.

08:44.257 --> 08:46.026
Getting this canister off,
it's frustrating as [bleep].

08:46.059 --> 08:48.562
The way I learned to do
canister Damascus

08:48.596 --> 08:51.298
was to watch
J. Neilson's YouTube video.

08:51.331 --> 08:53.300
And I think he left
a step or two out,

08:53.333 --> 08:55.335
because it's way harder
than when he did it.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.905
[saw whirring]

08:57.938 --> 08:59.907
- Hey!

08:59.940 --> 09:01.975
There you go!
- Yes! Jason found the chop saw.

09:02.009 --> 09:03.711
- They found the chop saw.
- Ta-da!

09:03.744 --> 09:08.181
*

09:08.215 --> 09:11.652
- I think that
the forge weld is good.

09:11.685 --> 09:14.154
It's time to remove
all the canister.

09:14.187 --> 09:15.889
[saw buzzing]

09:15.923 --> 09:17.758
It should be a solid piece.

09:17.791 --> 09:20.127
*

09:20.160 --> 09:21.995
[groans]

09:22.029 --> 09:26.199
- Francesco does not look
like a happy bladesmith.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.135
- Really?

09:28.168 --> 09:32.139
Once I open it,
nothing has welded inside.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.307
- Francesco's canoe

09:34.341 --> 09:36.009
looks like rabbit poop,
all squeezed together.

09:36.043 --> 09:37.811
- Yeah, it does.
And that's usually

09:37.845 --> 09:40.213
a matter of heat--
not letting your materials

09:40.247 --> 09:41.849
get up to the proper heat

09:41.882 --> 09:43.784
before you start
that welding process.

09:43.817 --> 09:47.220
- It looks like I have to
forge weld--again.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.322
You put the canister back
in the forge.

09:49.356 --> 09:52.159
After a couple of heats--
a couple of times in the press--

09:52.192 --> 09:55.362
I feel confident
it should fix the problem.

09:55.395 --> 09:58.165
It is ridiculous!

09:58.198 --> 10:00.233
- All right, Francesco needs
to take a deep breath.

10:00.267 --> 10:04.772
*

10:04.805 --> 10:06.106
- My whole billet falls apart.

10:06.139 --> 10:08.842
[sighs deeply]
Yeah.

10:08.876 --> 10:09.977
This is bad.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.779
*

10:11.812 --> 10:14.381
Sometimes being too confident

10:14.414 --> 10:16.083
has its downside.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.686
You're sure that
you're doing good,

10:18.719 --> 10:21.321
that you have
the temperature good...

10:21.354 --> 10:23.190
and then maybe you're not.

10:23.223 --> 10:25.358
- Is Francesco throwing in
the hammer?

10:25.392 --> 10:27.795
- There's no way
to recover from this.

10:27.828 --> 10:29.229
*

10:29.262 --> 10:30.664
[bleep].

10:30.698 --> 10:32.632
*

10:34.434 --> 10:39.339
- So Francesco's canoe
is not solid on the inside.

10:39.372 --> 10:44.177
- This is worst forge weld I did
since I started bladesmithing.

10:44.211 --> 10:48.115
There is not really
a recovery from that.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.751
Still got time to start over.

10:50.784 --> 10:54.955
- I can't quit,
because it's not what I do.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.858
Can I start another canister?

10:57.891 --> 10:59.292
Now let's see if I can do it.

10:59.326 --> 11:05.065
*

11:05.098 --> 11:07.367
- You have less than
90 minutes remaining

11:07.400 --> 11:09.703
to finish those daggers!

11:09.737 --> 11:11.872
*

11:11.905 --> 11:13.473
- Look at Don's billet.
Look at that.

11:13.506 --> 11:16.710
- Don's billet looks great.
- That's dialed in.

11:16.744 --> 11:18.078
- When you heat your bar up

11:18.111 --> 11:19.813
to welding temperature,

11:19.847 --> 11:21.915
you really need to get
that thing pressed

11:21.949 --> 11:23.483
as quick as you can,
and I just start mashing it.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.152
And lo and behold,
I'm looking down.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.419
It's like, "Oh, my gosh.

11:26.453 --> 11:27.354
I have a solid bar."

11:27.387 --> 11:29.022
*

11:29.056 --> 11:30.323
$10,000--

11:30.357 --> 11:31.925
I love some of the equipment,

11:31.959 --> 11:33.360
you know, on "Forged in Fire."

11:33.393 --> 11:34.928
I just may have
to buy something stupid.

11:34.962 --> 11:39.332
*

11:39.366 --> 11:41.468
- I haven't seen
Alf's steel in a while.

11:41.501 --> 11:43.937
- I just saw it.
- How's it look?

11:43.971 --> 11:46.039
- It's terrifying.
- [bleep].

11:46.073 --> 11:49.442
What I discovered is that
the billet is not completely

11:49.476 --> 11:52.045
forge welded together.

11:52.079 --> 11:54.347
So I need to just
put a crease in it.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.116
I'm just gonna
fold it over once

11:56.149 --> 11:57.818
and see if I can close
some of them voids

11:57.851 --> 11:59.820
and try to forge weld it
together.

11:59.853 --> 12:02.089
I need to make a single billet

12:02.122 --> 12:04.224
so I can get
that blade quenched.

12:04.257 --> 12:08.395
*

12:08.428 --> 12:11.198
- 45 minutes left--
it will be difficult

12:11.231 --> 12:13.366
within the time
to remove the canister.

12:13.400 --> 12:16.870
So, as soon as it's hot,
I go to the press.

12:16.904 --> 12:18.005
The piece is solid.

12:18.038 --> 12:20.140
I'm doing whatever I can

12:20.173 --> 12:22.309
to finish the blade.

12:22.342 --> 12:24.511
- Francesco is actually
making some progress here.

12:24.544 --> 12:27.347
- He is. He's got some good
welded-up steel.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.382
- Bladesmiths!

12:29.416 --> 12:30.517
30 minutes!

12:30.550 --> 12:32.019
*

12:32.052 --> 12:33.821
- Canister Damascus sucks.

12:33.854 --> 12:35.322
I got some delams in it.

12:35.355 --> 12:36.556
I'm hoping that those
just grind out.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.525
I'm gonna quench it,

12:38.558 --> 12:40.160
and I'm gonna do a little work
on the grinder.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.929
Oh!

12:41.962 --> 12:44.264
Jason just quenched his blade.
- He did.

12:44.297 --> 12:46.166
- My tang got a little
off-center when I was forging.

12:46.199 --> 12:47.901
It's pretty important
that I fix this,

12:47.935 --> 12:49.102
but I don't have time
to do that.

12:49.136 --> 12:50.570
[metal grinding]

12:50.603 --> 12:55.042
*

12:55.075 --> 12:57.477
- I feel I can still do it.

12:57.510 --> 12:59.046
I have a flat stock.

12:59.079 --> 13:00.948
I'm starting to forge the tang,

13:00.981 --> 13:03.817
but my blade is rough.

13:03.851 --> 13:07.220
[sighs] I'm feeling more
and more concerned,

13:07.254 --> 13:10.057
because it don't have--
even closely--

13:10.090 --> 13:13.293
the shape of a knife,
and I'm running out of time.

13:13.326 --> 13:16.496
- Can Francesco pull this off?
- Yeah, he can.

13:16.529 --> 13:19.532
But he just is
not working efficiently.

13:19.566 --> 13:21.501
When he went to cut off
that excess material,

13:21.534 --> 13:23.236
he could've just cut
an angle into it

13:23.270 --> 13:25.873
right across
and had a pre-formed tip.

13:25.906 --> 13:28.541
- Just for the sake
of not quitting,

13:28.575 --> 13:31.211
I go to try
and heat-treat.

13:31.244 --> 13:34.414
I think I need at least
10 to 12 minutes

13:34.447 --> 13:37.284
to reach the temperature
in order to quench the blade.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.518
*

13:38.551 --> 13:40.487
- It doesn't look like Francesco

13:40.520 --> 13:42.322
is gonna make the quench.
- You got to be kidding me.

13:42.355 --> 13:43.991
*

13:44.024 --> 13:46.960
What do we always say?
Time management.

13:46.994 --> 13:49.596
- You have one minute remaining
in this round!

13:49.629 --> 13:52.199
- He's gonna try and get it
up to temperature.

13:52.232 --> 13:55.168
- He'll never get it up to--
- No, not gonna happen.

13:55.202 --> 13:56.436
- It'll never suck up
enough heat.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.271
*

13:58.305 --> 13:59.306
- Ten!

13:59.339 --> 14:00.307
Nine!

14:00.340 --> 14:01.408
Eight!

14:01.441 --> 14:02.375
Seven!

14:02.409 --> 14:03.410
Six!

14:03.443 --> 14:04.444
Five!

14:04.477 --> 14:05.512
Four!

14:05.545 --> 14:06.479
Three!

14:06.513 --> 14:08.648
Two! One!

14:08.681 --> 14:11.551
Bladesmiths, shut down your
machines, drop your tools!

14:11.584 --> 14:13.586
This round is over!

14:13.620 --> 14:15.188
- Too late.
- Oh.

14:15.222 --> 14:17.057
*

14:17.090 --> 14:18.558
- The way I feel now

14:18.591 --> 14:21.028
is no apprehension.

14:21.061 --> 14:24.131
I made a blade that I feel
is competitive, no-nonsense.

14:24.164 --> 14:27.534
I'm pretty happy with it.
I'm happy with myself.

14:27.567 --> 14:30.637
- Even if I didn't quench
the blade,

14:30.670 --> 14:32.605
I would like to hear
from the judges

14:32.639 --> 14:36.176
that my blade is
one solid piece

14:36.209 --> 14:38.478
that could become
an actual knife

14:38.511 --> 14:39.512
in the second challenge.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.448
*

14:41.481 --> 14:43.416
- Bladesmiths,
in the first round

14:43.450 --> 14:45.418
of this competition,
you were given your choice

14:45.452 --> 14:47.487
of a variety
of beautiful steels

14:47.520 --> 14:50.523
from which to forge
a canister Damascus dagger.

14:50.557 --> 14:53.994
Now it's time to take a look
at what you did with that steel.

14:54.027 --> 14:55.562
Alf, you're up first.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.397
Please present your work
to the judges.

14:57.430 --> 15:00.667
*

15:00.700 --> 15:03.303
- Well, first off, Alf,
you get extra points

15:03.336 --> 15:06.139
for excellent facial hair
and a nice vest.

15:06.173 --> 15:09.276
These flakes back here--
they're in the tang.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.144
There seems to be
enough material there

15:11.178 --> 15:12.645
to deal with them, I hope,
but I'm looking

15:12.679 --> 15:16.249
at a lot of
kind of burnt metal.

15:16.283 --> 15:17.650
And I'm hoping
that doesn't go deep.

15:17.684 --> 15:18.952
*

15:18.986 --> 15:20.587
- Okay, Alf.

15:20.620 --> 15:23.056
Right now
it looks like a blade

15:23.090 --> 15:25.058
that is similar to an ogre.
[chuckles]

15:25.092 --> 15:26.659
But ogres have layers.

15:26.693 --> 15:29.062
And if you peel
the onion of layers,

15:29.096 --> 15:30.597
there's gonna be
a beautiful metal in there.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.732
- I won't let you down.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.501
- Jason, you're up.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.036
Please present your blade
to the judges.

15:36.069 --> 15:38.438
*

15:38.471 --> 15:41.274
- Jason, you do have some
little delam issues.

15:41.308 --> 15:43.476
There's a couple little pieces
on the edge here,

15:43.510 --> 15:45.145
and your tip.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.379
It's got a good shape to it,

15:46.413 --> 15:47.480
but I'm telling you,

15:47.514 --> 15:49.349
this is killing me.

15:49.382 --> 15:51.985
Explain to me why
you got the tang offset.

15:52.019 --> 15:54.321
- I plan on fixing it
with the grinder.

15:54.354 --> 15:55.455
- Yeah, it's gonna
be interesting to see

15:55.488 --> 15:56.489
how you take care
of that.

15:56.523 --> 15:58.191
Good job.
Thanks.

15:58.225 --> 16:00.160
- All right, Don.
Lay on.

16:00.193 --> 16:03.030
*

16:03.063 --> 16:05.232
- You got a few
little spots here,

16:05.265 --> 16:08.301
but you've got
a lot of mass here,

16:08.335 --> 16:11.571
which we're always saying,
"Forge thick, grind thin."

16:11.604 --> 16:14.641
So you've got more
than enough material here

16:14.674 --> 16:17.244
to remove any issues.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.212
- It looks to me
like most

16:19.246 --> 16:20.713
of the little delams you've got
here are surface,

16:20.747 --> 16:22.482
so those'll probably
just go away.

16:22.515 --> 16:24.717
All in all,
good-looking dagger.

16:24.751 --> 16:26.719
- Thank you.
- Francesco, you're up.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.388
Please present your work
to the judges.

16:28.421 --> 16:31.624
*

16:31.658 --> 16:34.561
- [groans, laughs]

16:34.594 --> 16:36.096
The effort you put in

16:36.129 --> 16:38.665
in the last hour
and 15 minutes

16:38.698 --> 16:40.567
of the first round
was outrageous.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.735
Once you made the choice

16:42.769 --> 16:45.572
to stop fighting with something
that wasn't working,

16:45.605 --> 16:48.241
you got it dialed in.

16:48.275 --> 16:51.478
- That last ten minutes
when you cut that tip in--

16:51.511 --> 16:53.313
why didn't you quench it?

16:53.346 --> 16:55.548
- I didn't think
I had enough time

16:55.582 --> 16:57.550
to heat it up
at temp--

16:57.584 --> 16:59.252
- Yeah, 'cause you put it
in the forge, like,

16:59.286 --> 17:01.254
with a minute,
or a minute, 20 seconds,

17:01.288 --> 17:02.555
and it's definitely
not enough time

17:02.589 --> 17:03.723
to get it up to temperature.

17:03.756 --> 17:04.824
I wish you had quenched it.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.659
*

17:06.693 --> 17:08.495
- Bladesmiths,
only three of you

17:08.528 --> 17:10.463
may move on to the second round,

17:10.497 --> 17:12.432
and it's time for one of you
to leave the Forge.

17:12.465 --> 17:15.568
*

17:15.602 --> 17:18.171
The bladesmith leaving
the Forge is...

17:18.205 --> 17:19.606
Francesco.

17:19.639 --> 17:21.208
Your weapon
did not make the cut.

17:21.241 --> 17:23.176
David Baker will explain.

17:23.210 --> 17:26.113
- Francesco, you showed
a lot of skill and drive

17:26.146 --> 17:27.680
to get that piece done.

17:27.714 --> 17:30.217
Unfortunately,
you didn't quench,

17:30.250 --> 17:32.319
and that blade
is not a hardened blade.

17:32.352 --> 17:34.221
That's why we got
to let you go.

17:34.254 --> 17:36.823
- Francesco,
please surrender your blade.

17:36.856 --> 17:38.625
- I made a blade

17:38.658 --> 17:40.760
that I feel
is not really a blade.

17:40.793 --> 17:43.496
Time crunch was one
of the reasons.

17:43.530 --> 17:45.398
It just didn't turn out.
[chuckles]

17:45.432 --> 17:48.435
I agree 1,000%
with the decision.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.403
I couldn't complete the task.

17:50.437 --> 17:52.772
I was taught
to never give up,

17:52.805 --> 17:56.476
even if the challenge
looks bigger than you.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.545
This is not gonna stop me.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.613
There is nothing that can
stop me from forging.

18:00.647 --> 18:02.649
*

18:02.682 --> 18:04.417
- Bladesmiths,
congratulations.

18:04.451 --> 18:06.819
Your blades have made it
into the second round.

18:06.853 --> 18:09.189
It's time to turn them
into fully functional weapons

18:09.222 --> 18:11.191
by adding handles to them,

18:11.224 --> 18:13.360
using the range of materials
provided in our pantry.

18:13.393 --> 18:15.295
You will have three hours
in this round.

18:15.328 --> 18:17.397
Your finished blades
will be tested

18:17.430 --> 18:21.168
for strength and durability
in an oil-can stab

18:21.201 --> 18:25.672
and for edge retention
in a ham stab and slice.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.607
How you choose
to design those weapons

18:27.640 --> 18:29.742
to perform in those challenges
is entirely up to you.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.711
However,

18:31.744 --> 18:35.482
because we are doing
the stabbing test manually,

18:35.515 --> 18:37.750
the judges require
that you put a guard

18:37.784 --> 18:39.519
on your dagger
to prevent their hands

18:39.552 --> 18:40.753
from slipping up to the blade.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.889
*

18:42.922 --> 18:44.457
Good luck, bladesmiths.

18:44.491 --> 18:46.193
Your three hours starts...
now.

18:46.226 --> 18:48.161
*

18:48.195 --> 18:49.762
- And off to the races we go.

18:49.796 --> 18:54.434
*

18:54.467 --> 18:56.569
- I know my blade is thick,

18:56.603 --> 18:59.639
but it needs a lot
of shape work done to it.

18:59.672 --> 19:01.841
I've done a lot
of double-edged daggers,

19:01.874 --> 19:03.776
so I'm in my comfort zone.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.412
When I started bladesmithing,

19:05.445 --> 19:07.680
I was working
for a NASA contractor,

19:07.714 --> 19:10.950
and they had a shop
that was just--wow.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.353
So we started making
some knives there.

19:13.386 --> 19:15.288
[laughs]

19:15.322 --> 19:16.856
Thank you for your federal
tax dollars at work.

19:16.889 --> 19:18.691
I'm pretty confident

19:18.725 --> 19:20.460
that when he goes
to stab that oil drum,

19:20.493 --> 19:22.429
it's gonna bleed.
[laughs]

19:22.462 --> 19:24.431
[grinder whirring]

19:24.464 --> 19:26.399
- I'm gonna grind some
of the scale off of that blade.

19:26.433 --> 19:28.701
It's gonna take some time.

19:28.735 --> 19:30.570
- Yeah, that technique
that Alf's using--

19:30.603 --> 19:33.940
seems like you would dig
deep grooves into your blade

19:33.973 --> 19:36.343
that you just have to
clean up anyway.

19:36.376 --> 19:38.645
- I turn the grinder,
rather than at an angle--

19:38.678 --> 19:40.880
as they call 'em,
angle grinders--

19:40.913 --> 19:44.484
and cut into the metal
to remove it much faster.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.319
Having 60 years' experience

19:46.353 --> 19:48.521
doesn't mean I got
the upper hand

19:48.555 --> 19:50.457
or the edge
on anyone else,

19:50.490 --> 19:52.292
but I really know
what I'm talking about,

19:52.325 --> 19:53.460
and you're gonna
see it yourself.

19:53.493 --> 19:56.963
*

19:56.996 --> 19:58.731
- First thing I need
to do is get rid

19:58.765 --> 20:00.567
of the delamination
in my blade.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.469
I'm doing a hollow grind,

20:02.502 --> 20:04.704
because I can get
a little bit deeper with that

20:04.737 --> 20:06.673
and I can see
where they're at.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.708
- Jason is going a lot slower.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.443
I think he would've
ground out faster

20:10.477 --> 20:12.479
using the smaller wheels.

20:12.512 --> 20:14.514
- Yeah, working as a firefighter
definitely makes me

20:14.547 --> 20:16.416
stay calm under pressure.

20:16.449 --> 20:17.684
We're under pressure
every single day

20:17.717 --> 20:19.319
that we're on the job.

20:19.352 --> 20:20.653
With an hour and
15 minutes left,

20:20.687 --> 20:21.954
I'm cool as a cucumber.

20:21.988 --> 20:26.693
*

20:26.726 --> 20:28.495
- I'm going with
the big, thick stuff

20:28.528 --> 20:30.297
for a guard--
3/8-inch thick brass.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.599
When you're gonna be trying
to shove a knife

20:32.632 --> 20:34.734
through a steel drum,
you don't want your hand to slip

20:34.767 --> 20:37.604
off that handle
and slice your fingers open.

20:37.637 --> 20:39.706
Whoo!

20:39.739 --> 20:40.873
*

20:40.907 --> 20:42.375
Oh, wow.

20:42.409 --> 20:44.277
There's a nice black piece

20:44.311 --> 20:46.746
of some sort of African horn
for my handle.

20:46.779 --> 20:47.814
Horn is great.
It's hollow.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.749
I look down inside the horn,

20:49.782 --> 20:52.352
and there's a whole lot
of empty space. [laughs]

20:52.385 --> 20:53.820
It's gonna need about
two whole bottles' worth

20:53.853 --> 20:55.555
of epoxy
to fill that sucker.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.557
*

20:57.590 --> 20:58.825
- Look at Don, man.
- I love that. That's great.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.593
- Just pouring
the epoxy into it.

21:00.627 --> 21:01.961
I've never seen that one
before, either.

21:01.994 --> 21:03.596
- That's great.
That's awesome.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.064
- I'm thinking to myself,
"Well, hey,

21:05.097 --> 21:06.599
"there's no way this guard's

21:06.633 --> 21:08.368
gonna come loose
on this knife."

21:08.401 --> 21:11.338
*

21:11.371 --> 21:13.506
- Don't even know what
in the hell that is.

21:13.540 --> 21:15.475
I finally found something
that looks like

21:15.508 --> 21:16.943
the kind of thing
that's gonna work for me--

21:16.976 --> 21:19.746
that I could take it down
without breaking it.

21:19.779 --> 21:23.450
My plan is to do
a simple burn-through

21:23.483 --> 21:25.785
and fit the handle
onto the tang.

21:25.818 --> 21:27.420
- He's got a fire
going on over there.

21:27.454 --> 21:29.389
He's gonna burn his block.

21:29.422 --> 21:31.057
- I don't want to have
to glue this thing on

21:31.090 --> 21:32.959
because I do primitive work.

21:32.992 --> 21:34.827
- Should there be a flame?

21:34.861 --> 21:36.696
- If he went over and got
a piece of handle material

21:36.729 --> 21:38.064
that already had a hole in it,

21:38.097 --> 21:39.966
he wouldn't have to
do any of that.

21:39.999 --> 21:42.602
- You guys make it sound like
it's easy, but it never is.

21:42.635 --> 21:46.406
*

21:46.439 --> 21:49.075
- I need to straighten
my tang.

21:49.108 --> 21:50.810
I'm just thinking,
"Please don't break."

21:50.843 --> 21:53.346
*

21:53.380 --> 21:55.348
I'm worried
about snapping it

21:55.382 --> 21:57.617
or messing up my heat treat.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.786
That looks terrible.

21:59.819 --> 22:02.555
If I had more time, I would
[bleep] with this a whole lot.

22:02.589 --> 22:03.490
I don't have time to do that.

22:03.523 --> 22:04.991
- Bladesmiths!

22:05.024 --> 22:06.826
You have just
45 minutes remaining!

22:06.859 --> 22:09.429
*

22:09.462 --> 22:11.097
- I want to be
an independent thinker.

22:11.130 --> 22:13.700
Since we have to put
a guard on this blade,

22:13.733 --> 22:15.902
I'm gonna integrate the guard
into the handle itself

22:15.935 --> 22:17.937
rather than
put a bunch of brass.

22:17.970 --> 22:20.740
In my mind,
that would be wrong.

22:20.773 --> 22:21.974
- I like Alf's style.

22:22.008 --> 22:23.876
He's just like,

22:23.910 --> 22:26.078
"I'm gonna do it all
out of this one block of wood."

22:26.112 --> 22:27.647
- He's sculpting.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.416
Done properly,
it could be cool.

22:29.449 --> 22:31.451
[tools whirring]

22:31.484 --> 22:33.486
*

22:33.520 --> 22:35.522
- Hey, I got
18 minutes left on the clock,

22:35.555 --> 22:37.957
so I'm thinking
I can do a split tang.

22:37.990 --> 22:40.059
So what I'm doing is,
on the tang,

22:40.092 --> 22:42.529
you split it,
and that gives you

22:42.562 --> 22:44.897
two little dog ears
that you can then hammer down

22:44.931 --> 22:46.999
and fold over,
and it cinches things down.

22:47.033 --> 22:48.868
*

22:48.901 --> 22:50.603
- Now, did Don
just split his tang?

22:50.637 --> 22:52.038
- Yes.
- Yes.

22:52.071 --> 22:53.706
- Splitting the tang--
brilliant.

22:53.740 --> 22:55.475
He can feather it out
in either direction,

22:55.508 --> 22:57.043
and it's a compression fit.

22:57.076 --> 22:58.511
Though he's got
a lot of glue in there,

22:58.545 --> 22:59.846
it's still
a compression fit,

22:59.879 --> 23:01.481
which I like to see
on a dagger.

23:01.514 --> 23:03.115
- And I get a cold chisel,

23:03.149 --> 23:05.084
put it into the groove--
ping, ping, ping--

23:05.117 --> 23:07.554
and the end of my tang
falls off.

23:07.587 --> 23:08.621
What the [bleep]?

23:08.655 --> 23:11.858
*

23:11.891 --> 23:13.560
Can I get a welding curtain?

23:13.593 --> 23:15.094
The only thing
I can think of is,

23:15.127 --> 23:16.996
"Hey, we got two
MIG welders over there."

23:17.029 --> 23:19.165
And now I need to weld
a tip to a washer I made

23:19.198 --> 23:22.502
that's about 1/16
of an inch wide,

23:22.535 --> 23:24.170
and it's kind of difficult.

23:24.203 --> 23:26.105
You pray that you
don't strike an arc

23:26.138 --> 23:27.640
right next to a finger
on the ground clamp.

23:27.674 --> 23:29.476
*

23:29.509 --> 23:32.078
- Don's over here,
12 minutes left to go...

23:32.111 --> 23:33.980
- He's pushing the boundary.

23:34.013 --> 23:35.915
- I got to be able
to hit that in the right spot.

23:35.948 --> 23:38.585
*

23:38.618 --> 23:40.520
I see that it's tack-welded.

23:40.553 --> 23:42.589
It's not pretty,
but it's tack-welded in place.

23:42.622 --> 23:45.925
So boom--
I'm back in the race.

23:45.958 --> 23:49.028
- I've picked some sort
of red-burl handle material.

23:49.061 --> 23:52.131
It's fire-engine red.
You know I got to go with that.

23:52.164 --> 23:54.033
I love to compete.

23:54.066 --> 23:56.135
Everything at the fire station
is a competition,

23:56.168 --> 23:58.838
from who gets on the truck first
to who gets to do the dishes.

23:58.871 --> 24:00.507
The guy that isn't doing

24:00.540 --> 24:02.208
the dishes
is the one that's lazy.

24:02.241 --> 24:04.544
You don't want to be
the guy that's lazy.

24:04.577 --> 24:06.746
- Jason's mixing epoxy.

24:06.779 --> 24:09.048
- So I get the handle
epoxied on.

24:09.081 --> 24:10.583
I didn't really think
it through very well.

24:10.617 --> 24:12.018
I didn't have time to clamp.

24:12.051 --> 24:13.620
I have to sit here
for five minutes

24:13.653 --> 24:15.221
while it sets up.

24:15.254 --> 24:17.189
- Don't hold that blade
against your belly.

24:17.223 --> 24:19.626
- Jason's been doing that
all afternoon.

24:19.659 --> 24:21.694
- Should he lean too heavily,

24:21.728 --> 24:23.796
it'll get very exciting
in here--very wet as well.

24:23.830 --> 24:26.132
*

24:26.165 --> 24:27.600
- I like that.

24:27.634 --> 24:29.569
I'm very confident

24:29.602 --> 24:31.103
that I'm gonna be able
to breeze through this.

24:31.137 --> 24:33.640
Because of my style,
I'm not gonna add

24:33.673 --> 24:35.508
a lot of bells and whistles.

24:35.542 --> 24:38.110
I'm gonna keep it primitive
like I normally do.

24:38.144 --> 24:40.513
- This is the part
that could get scary.

24:40.547 --> 24:42.749
I mean, this is the part where
your material could crack.

24:42.782 --> 24:46.085
- Well, he's using Micarta,
which is incredibly strong.

24:46.118 --> 24:47.887
I don't think that's gonna crack
from hitting it

24:47.920 --> 24:49.722
with that hammer.

24:49.756 --> 24:51.624
- I would not normally think so,
but keep in mind

24:51.658 --> 24:53.560
that he did burn through
with that Micarta.

24:53.593 --> 24:55.294
- So that could've made
the Micarta brittle?

24:55.327 --> 24:56.963
- It could've
made it brittle, yes.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.566
- Aha!

24:59.599 --> 25:01.233
I'm feeling really good
right now.

25:01.267 --> 25:03.302
I got done before
they rang the bell.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.838
I might have a blade, here.

25:05.872 --> 25:06.939
- Ten!

25:06.973 --> 25:07.940
Nine!

25:07.974 --> 25:08.975
Eight!

25:09.008 --> 25:10.042
Seven!

25:10.076 --> 25:11.077
Six!

25:11.110 --> 25:12.078
Five!

25:12.111 --> 25:13.112
Four!

25:13.145 --> 25:14.246
Three!

25:14.280 --> 25:16.549
Two! One!

25:16.583 --> 25:17.717
Bladesmiths,
shut down your machines,

25:17.750 --> 25:18.818
drop your tools!

25:18.851 --> 25:20.720
This round is over!

25:20.753 --> 25:22.121
- I know this blade's
gonna be subjected

25:22.154 --> 25:24.056
to some tough tests.

25:24.090 --> 25:25.858
I'm confident
that it'll work very well.

25:25.892 --> 25:27.627
*

25:27.660 --> 25:29.328
- Bladesmiths,
welcome to our strength test--

25:29.361 --> 25:31.864
the steel-drum stab.

25:31.898 --> 25:33.933
I'm gonna take each
of your daggers

25:33.966 --> 25:37.670
and thrust them through
the top of this can three times.

25:37.704 --> 25:39.672
It's gonna test the strength
of the tip of your dagger,

25:39.706 --> 25:41.007
as well as
the overall construction

25:41.040 --> 25:42.809
of the entire piece.

25:42.842 --> 25:44.811
Don, you look
a little nervous there.

25:44.844 --> 25:46.012
- I am.
[laughs]

25:46.045 --> 25:47.747
*

25:47.780 --> 25:49.081
I'm feeling
a little concerned

25:49.115 --> 25:51.317
about the steel-drum stab,

25:51.350 --> 25:52.985
'cause if that blade is
as brittle

25:53.019 --> 25:55.287
as that tang tip is,

25:55.321 --> 25:57.857
it may come out of that drum
in about three or four pieces.

25:57.890 --> 26:00.793
[rock music]

26:00.827 --> 26:05.865
*

26:05.898 --> 26:09.669
Yeah. [laughs]
- Nice.

26:09.702 --> 26:11.971
- This is a beast, Don.
- [laughs]

26:12.004 --> 26:14.006
- It thrusts good.

26:14.040 --> 26:16.342
You can see, each time,
where it stopped.

26:16.375 --> 26:18.344
Going in the first time,

26:18.377 --> 26:20.112
had to kind of work it out,
and it kind of threw me

26:20.146 --> 26:21.914
off balance
a little bit.

26:21.948 --> 26:24.283
But overall, good job.
It worked well on the test.

26:24.316 --> 26:25.885
- Thank you.

26:25.918 --> 26:27.219
- What are you
thinking, Jason?

26:27.253 --> 26:28.655
- Let's see what happens.

26:28.688 --> 26:30.022
*

26:30.056 --> 26:32.058
J. is fixing to stab my knife

26:32.091 --> 26:34.260
into the drum lid,
and the tang didn't work out

26:34.293 --> 26:35.695
quite the way I wanted it to.

26:35.728 --> 26:37.697
I'm just thinking to myself,

26:37.730 --> 26:40.800
"Man, I sure hope
this thing doesn't shatter."

26:40.833 --> 26:47.774
*

26:54.714 --> 26:56.248
- Nice job.

26:56.282 --> 26:59.085
- Well, Jason, it'll stab.
No doubt about that.

26:59.118 --> 27:00.687
*

27:00.720 --> 27:03.222
Just a hair of flatness
on that tip.

27:03.255 --> 27:04.891
Not bad at all.

27:04.924 --> 27:06.358
You can see how far it went in

27:06.392 --> 27:08.761
by the marks
from the white paint.

27:08.795 --> 27:11.698
The only thing I really
had a problem with is,

27:11.731 --> 27:12.965
once you get
to this point,

27:12.999 --> 27:14.801
it narrows out
quite a bit,

27:14.834 --> 27:16.803
and on that last thrust,

27:16.836 --> 27:19.171
it got stuck,
and I had to pull so hard,

27:19.205 --> 27:20.406
I ended up smacking myself
in the hand.

27:20.439 --> 27:25.344
*

27:25.377 --> 27:27.914
But it went through the lid.

27:27.947 --> 27:30.249
You did a really good job.
- Thank you.

27:30.282 --> 27:31.884
- Alf, you ready?

27:31.918 --> 27:34.453
- Let's give it a go.
- All right.

27:34.486 --> 27:37.724
- I feel like
when J. tests my blade,

27:37.757 --> 27:39.325
it's gonna go all the way
up to the hilt,

27:39.358 --> 27:41.393
all the way up to the ricasso,
if not further.

27:41.427 --> 27:48.334
*

27:52.404 --> 27:54.006
- Alf, we got a problem here.

27:54.040 --> 27:55.908
*

27:56.909 --> 27:58.210
- Something's
really wrong here

27:58.244 --> 28:00.346
- Alf, we got a problem.

28:00.379 --> 28:02.414
There's no guard.

28:02.448 --> 28:05.417
There's nothing that's going to
absolutely stop my hand

28:05.451 --> 28:07.086
from sliding up
onto this blade,

28:07.119 --> 28:08.287
stabbing into
a steel drum.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.156
*

28:10.189 --> 28:12.158
I can't test this safely
without risking injury.

28:12.191 --> 28:13.893
*

28:13.926 --> 28:16.095
- Bladesmiths,
we asked you to make

28:16.128 --> 28:17.964
a Damascus dagger
with a guard

28:17.997 --> 28:19.431
that was appropriately designed

28:19.465 --> 28:22.068
for the challenges
that lie ahead.

28:22.101 --> 28:25.104
Alf, you failed to add
a guard to your dagger,

28:25.137 --> 28:26.906
and therefore,
I have to ask you

28:26.939 --> 28:28.908
to now leave the Forge.

28:28.941 --> 28:30.843
- Thank you.

28:30.877 --> 28:32.244
I believed that
the guard on this

28:32.278 --> 28:33.946
was gonna be sufficient enough.

28:33.980 --> 28:36.282
I am not at all unhappy.

28:36.315 --> 28:38.918
I might not have won
this competition,

28:38.951 --> 28:41.487
but I'm still Alf,
tenth-generation blacksmith.

28:41.520 --> 28:43.122
Just--I got to keep going,

28:43.155 --> 28:44.824
carrying on that legacy.

28:44.857 --> 28:47.894
*

28:47.927 --> 28:50.129
- Jason, Don.
Congratulations.

28:50.162 --> 28:53.032
You've made it into the third
round of this competition.

28:53.065 --> 28:55.034
We're sending you back
to your home forges

28:55.067 --> 28:57.904
to re-create
an iconic weapon from history.

28:57.937 --> 28:59.138
That weapon is...

28:59.171 --> 29:01.841
*

29:01.874 --> 29:03.309
The scissor.

29:03.342 --> 29:05.477
- [laughing]
both: Oh, God.

29:05.511 --> 29:07.980
- Wielded by gladiators
in Ancient Rome,

29:08.014 --> 29:10.182
the scissor was an ideal weapon
for the bloody battles

29:10.216 --> 29:12.284
that ensued
in the Colosseum arena.

29:12.318 --> 29:14.887
The contour of the sharp,
crescent-shaped blade

29:14.921 --> 29:16.989
was optimal
for slashing and stabbing,

29:17.023 --> 29:19.926
while the armor encasing
the forearm offered protection.

29:19.959 --> 29:21.894
Gladiators
who used the scissor

29:21.928 --> 29:24.130
were also known as scissores.

29:24.163 --> 29:26.265
They could swiftly brandish
the weapon in the heat of battle

29:26.298 --> 29:28.300
due to its surprisingly
light weight.

29:28.334 --> 29:31.070
The dual block-and-cut
capabilities of the scissor

29:31.103 --> 29:34.040
freed the user's other arm
for another weapon or shield,

29:34.073 --> 29:37.276
giving the user the advantage
of multiple ways to attack.

29:37.309 --> 29:40.880
Your final challenge
is to re-create a scissor.

29:40.913 --> 29:44.050
It must be an effective,
working version of that weapon.

29:44.083 --> 29:47.086
Your scissor must include
an at least two-inch-wide,

29:47.119 --> 29:50.489
crescent-shaped blade
that is 8 to 10 inches

29:50.522 --> 29:53.159
from one crescent tip
to the other.

29:53.192 --> 29:56.328
The forearm guard must be
at least 10 inches in length

29:56.362 --> 29:58.164
and include
an internal handle.

29:58.197 --> 29:59.999
Gentlemen,
at the end of five days,

30:00.032 --> 30:01.500
you will return
and present your scissors

30:01.533 --> 30:03.335
to our panel
of expert judges.

30:03.369 --> 30:05.104
Only after
they've submitted them

30:05.137 --> 30:08.240
to a series
of excruciatingly brutal tests

30:08.274 --> 30:10.910
will they declare one of you
the "Forged in Fire" champion,

30:10.943 --> 30:14.380
who also leaves
with that check for $10,000.

30:14.413 --> 30:16.482
Well, good luck, bladesmiths.

30:16.515 --> 30:18.084
We'll see you in five days.

30:18.117 --> 30:21.120
*

30:21.153 --> 30:24.056
[rock music]

30:24.090 --> 30:26.225
*

30:26.258 --> 30:28.294
- Day one.

30:28.327 --> 30:30.529
It feels good to be
in my own forge.

30:30.562 --> 30:32.398
I've never built armor before.

30:32.431 --> 30:34.466
I've never shaped
sheet metal before.

30:34.500 --> 30:37.203
I need a book--
"Armor For Dummies," you know?

30:37.236 --> 30:38.905
They don't make it.
I looked.

30:38.938 --> 30:40.907
*

30:40.940 --> 30:42.541
The two billets
I'm making right now

30:42.574 --> 30:43.943
are gonna be for the blade.

30:43.976 --> 30:45.611
I'm gonna twist one one way,

30:45.644 --> 30:47.179
and I'm gonna twist
the other one the other way.

30:47.213 --> 30:48.547
I just like the way it looks.

30:48.580 --> 30:50.149
I almost screwed that up

30:50.182 --> 30:51.984
and twisted it
the same direction.

30:52.018 --> 30:55.955
*

30:55.988 --> 30:58.524
I'm going up against Don
from Texas.

30:58.557 --> 31:00.392
Oklahoma always beats Texas.

31:00.426 --> 31:03.562
*

31:03.595 --> 31:05.932
- I'm not really familiar
with a gladiator scissor,

31:05.965 --> 31:07.499
but since it is armoring--

31:07.533 --> 31:09.668
I've been doing armoring
for about 25 years,

31:09.701 --> 31:11.103
and I'm sure I can overcome
any challenges

31:11.137 --> 31:12.905
that come up for it.

31:12.939 --> 31:14.273
I'm using
a coarse wrought iron

31:14.306 --> 31:15.942
combined with high-carbon steel

31:15.975 --> 31:18.410
to make
a composite-welded blade.

31:18.444 --> 31:20.312
I have no idea what
that came off of--

31:20.346 --> 31:24.183
just part of
my 500 pounds of stuff.

31:24.216 --> 31:25.617
Hey, man, we're Texas.

31:25.651 --> 31:27.186
We're bigger and better,

31:27.219 --> 31:28.354
and our blades are better.
[laughs]

31:28.387 --> 31:30.489
*

31:30.522 --> 31:32.658
- Today's armor day.
It's the big experiment day.

31:32.691 --> 31:34.626
But it seems like all week's
been an experiment.

31:34.660 --> 31:36.662
Yesterday I got
a pattern cut out.

31:36.695 --> 31:40.232
I'm gonna try to get
the gauntlet shaped today.

31:40.266 --> 31:41.968
I have
this big piece of pipe,

31:42.001 --> 31:43.669
so I can wrap
the metal around it.

31:43.702 --> 31:45.371
I'm just trying to beat
the [bleep] out of it

31:45.404 --> 31:47.239
until it goes
where I want it to.

31:47.273 --> 31:49.041
I'm probably doing this

31:49.075 --> 31:50.977
the hardest [bleep]
possible way there is.

31:51.010 --> 31:56.348
*

31:56.382 --> 31:59.151
So I've got it lined up
with my marks.

31:59.185 --> 32:01.320
Now I'm gonna throw a little
tack weld on each end

32:01.353 --> 32:03.122
and then start getting
the seams closer together.

32:03.155 --> 32:05.024
*

32:05.057 --> 32:06.425
And that almost looks
like I meant to do it.

32:06.458 --> 32:07.659
*

32:07.693 --> 32:10.062
[thunder rumbles]

32:10.096 --> 32:13.499
- My whole gauntlet section
is done in three pieces.

32:13.532 --> 32:15.467
The only thing I have left
to do is

32:15.501 --> 32:17.269
to make sure all the parts
fit back together--

32:17.303 --> 32:19.105
there's no warps in there
that I can't take out.

32:19.138 --> 32:20.339
Problem I had the first time.

32:20.372 --> 32:22.141
*

32:22.174 --> 32:24.510
I'm trying to get
the main cone put on.

32:24.543 --> 32:26.412
It's driving me nuts.

32:26.445 --> 32:29.115
There's a slight warp in it.

32:29.148 --> 32:31.283
It keeps catching
on the inner layer.

32:31.317 --> 32:33.719
*

32:33.752 --> 32:35.454
[sighs]
Turn it...

32:35.487 --> 32:38.624
*

32:38.657 --> 32:41.227
[grunts]

32:41.260 --> 32:42.194
[exhales sharply]

32:42.228 --> 32:44.163
*

32:44.196 --> 32:45.397
Damn it.

32:45.431 --> 32:47.699
*

32:47.733 --> 32:49.435
I feel like something bad
is about to happen.

32:51.570 --> 32:57.743
*

32:57.776 --> 32:59.611
There we go.

32:59.645 --> 33:01.247
[sighs in relief]

33:01.280 --> 33:02.648
That was a pain.

33:02.681 --> 33:04.683
*

33:04.716 --> 33:06.585
- This is billet number three.

33:06.618 --> 33:09.055
I have a billet of Damascus.

33:09.088 --> 33:11.423
I'm not 100% satisfied
with it.

33:11.457 --> 33:14.093
I don't think it's gonna look
the way that I want.

33:14.126 --> 33:16.662
I'm gonna start over
with just some plain steel.

33:16.695 --> 33:20.466
I did not want to be forging
on day four.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.568
I'm going with the W2.

33:22.601 --> 33:25.071
It's gonna look good. It's gonna
have the look that I want.

33:25.104 --> 33:26.405
And I'm not gonna be
wasting any more time.

33:26.438 --> 33:27.773
*

33:27.806 --> 33:29.508
I'm starting to get the blade

33:29.541 --> 33:31.043
pretty close
to the shape I want.

33:31.077 --> 33:33.045
Keeping my measurements
in mind.

33:33.079 --> 33:34.046
Let's get it done.

33:34.080 --> 33:41.053
*

33:44.223 --> 33:46.358
Even though I don't like
the way the blade looks,

33:46.392 --> 33:48.427
performance-wise, though,

33:48.460 --> 33:50.562
I think it's gonna perform
just as good as Don's.

33:50.596 --> 33:52.598
If I lose, hell,
I guess he just got lucky.

33:52.631 --> 33:53.665
Even a blind squirrel
will get a nut

33:53.699 --> 33:54.600
every once in a while.

33:54.633 --> 33:56.402
[laughing]

33:56.435 --> 33:58.470
*

33:58.504 --> 34:01.340
- All I have left to do
is sharpen the blade

34:01.373 --> 34:03.242
and then do
a little bit of testing.

34:03.275 --> 34:04.643
Wouldn't want to trip
while holding this.

34:04.676 --> 34:05.844
That would really suck.

34:05.877 --> 34:08.414
[laughing]

34:08.447 --> 34:10.449
I want to make sure
nothing's gonna rattle loose

34:10.482 --> 34:12.784
when the judges start
hitting stuff with it...

34:12.818 --> 34:14.086
That would hurt.

34:14.120 --> 34:16.455
The final test...

34:16.488 --> 34:18.824
*

34:18.857 --> 34:21.327
It rubs on a knuckle slightly,

34:21.360 --> 34:23.662
but I got to be honest,
I didn't even notice that

34:23.695 --> 34:25.564
until afterwards,
because I was just having

34:25.597 --> 34:27.333
too much fun swinging
and cutting things with it.

34:27.366 --> 34:30.669
*

34:30.702 --> 34:32.704
- Jason, Don,
welcome back to the Forge.

34:32.738 --> 34:34.873
You've both had five days
at your home forges

34:34.906 --> 34:36.708
to work on your scissors.

34:36.742 --> 34:38.710
Jason, how did it go?
- It was challenging.

34:38.744 --> 34:39.878
*

34:39.911 --> 34:41.347
I chased rabbits

34:41.380 --> 34:43.182
for five days down holes.

34:43.215 --> 34:45.117
And...never made armor before,

34:45.151 --> 34:47.419
but I think it turned out
fairly decent.

34:47.453 --> 34:50.156
- Don, how'd it go for you?
- I had fun.

34:50.189 --> 34:52.858
I did a composite weld
between some coarse wrought iron

34:52.891 --> 34:55.794
and 1084 high-carbon steel.

34:55.827 --> 34:59.698
The gauntlet part of it
was made from 4130 sheet metal

34:59.731 --> 35:01.400
that's been hardened
and tempered.

35:01.433 --> 35:02.734
So I'm looking forward
to testing it.

35:02.768 --> 35:04.636
- All right, bladesmiths,

35:04.670 --> 35:06.605
your weapons will now be put
through three tests.

35:06.638 --> 35:09.208
Up first, Dave.

35:09.241 --> 35:10.842
- All right, gentlemen,
this is the sharpness test.

35:10.876 --> 35:12.844
To test the sharpness
of your edge,

35:12.878 --> 35:14.513
I'm gonna attack
our sand man here

35:14.546 --> 35:16.748
several times,
see how they do.

35:16.782 --> 35:18.684
Jason, you're up first.
Are you ready for this?

35:18.717 --> 35:20.319
- Yes, sir.
- All right, let's do it.

35:20.352 --> 35:21.687
- My scissor is not pretty.

35:21.720 --> 35:22.921
It's sharp, and it's pointed,

35:22.954 --> 35:24.723
and it'll kill something.

35:24.756 --> 35:26.425
I think it'll survive
the tests just fine.

35:26.458 --> 35:28.194
I'm looking forward to it.

35:28.227 --> 35:35.167
*

35:42.408 --> 35:43.775
- [chuckling]

35:43.809 --> 35:46.412
All right,
the handle feels really good

35:46.445 --> 35:48.614
in my hand,
but the shape of your blade--

35:48.647 --> 35:50.916
not being
as deep a crescent

35:50.949 --> 35:54.253
made it a little bit
more difficult to slash.

35:54.286 --> 35:56.655
All in all, solid,
and it's got a good look.

35:56.688 --> 35:58.357
Nicely done.
- Thank you.

35:58.390 --> 35:59.591
- All right, Don.
You ready?

35:59.625 --> 36:01.393
- I'm ready.

36:01.427 --> 36:03.629
- Dave making comments
on Jason's grip--

36:03.662 --> 36:05.464
I'm feeling pretty nervous.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.333
I'm really a little bit
concerned

36:07.366 --> 36:08.967
about how his hand's gonna fit
inside my scissor.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.936
I made it to fit my hand.

36:10.969 --> 36:12.704
It's a huge issue--if you can't
comfortably hold it,

36:12.738 --> 36:14.706
is it gonna affect
how my weapon performs?

36:14.740 --> 36:21.713
*

36:49.275 --> 36:50.942
- Don, I like the way
this is set up--

36:50.976 --> 36:52.811
tighter around the arm.

36:52.844 --> 36:54.580
But right here
at my hand,

36:54.613 --> 36:58.284
my knuckle is just
pounding into the side.

36:58.317 --> 37:01.453
You can see it slashed
pretty easily on the arm,

37:01.487 --> 37:03.655
and then
on the forward punch,

37:03.689 --> 37:06.892
didn't quite get the slash
that I was looking for.

37:06.925 --> 37:08.827
- I'm feeling a little nervous.

37:08.860 --> 37:10.496
It didn't perform
like I wanted.

37:10.529 --> 37:12.331
I think Jason
had the edge here.

37:12.364 --> 37:14.032
His was a more comfortable fit
across the hand.

37:14.065 --> 37:15.601
- All in all, though,

37:15.634 --> 37:16.935
it did the job.
- Thank you.

37:16.968 --> 37:17.969
- Next up,
I'll give you to Doug.

37:18.003 --> 37:19.305
- Bladesmiths,

37:19.338 --> 37:20.739
this is the kill test.

37:20.772 --> 37:22.441
To see what kind
of lethal damage

37:22.474 --> 37:24.643
your weapon will do,
I will take your scissor,

37:24.676 --> 37:27.813
and I will deliver killing blows
on this ballistics dummy.

37:27.846 --> 37:29.348
Jason, you're up first.
You ready?

37:29.381 --> 37:30.449
- Let's do it.
- Let's do this.

37:30.482 --> 37:37.423
*

37:45.030 --> 37:47.499
- [laughing]
- First up--

37:47.533 --> 37:49.501
the minute I put my hand
in your handle,

37:49.535 --> 37:52.838
it's not directly
in line with my fist,

37:52.871 --> 37:54.673
so it's slightly off.

37:54.706 --> 37:57.376
But as you can see,
I can still wield the weapon.

37:57.409 --> 37:59.511
The laceration was deep

37:59.545 --> 38:01.613
into this cavity right here,

38:01.647 --> 38:03.815
so you've got
a very sharp blade.

38:03.849 --> 38:06.585
The hook you have
penetrated right into the heart.

38:06.618 --> 38:09.087
On the backhand draw,
it lacerates

38:09.120 --> 38:10.689
and guts everything out

38:10.722 --> 38:14.693
and disembowel
this ballistics dummy.

38:14.726 --> 38:17.329
Your weapon, sir, will kill.

38:17.363 --> 38:19.765
Good job, sir.
- Thank you.

38:19.798 --> 38:21.400
- Don, your turn.

38:21.433 --> 38:23.034
- Let's have some fun.
- Let's do this.

38:23.068 --> 38:30.075
*

38:30.108 --> 38:33.812
[Don laughing]

38:33.845 --> 38:35.381
- Good.

38:35.414 --> 38:37.048
Don, let's talk
about your weapon.

38:37.082 --> 38:38.717
What I like about your weapon

38:38.750 --> 38:41.019
is that it's in line
with the handle.

38:41.052 --> 38:42.621
On the initial cut here,

38:42.654 --> 38:44.423
it lacerated
right through there.

38:44.456 --> 38:47.659
And in this backhand hook,
your edge is deep,

38:47.693 --> 38:51.363
to go in here
and right into that cavity.

38:51.397 --> 38:53.565
Your weapon will kill.
- Thank you.

38:53.599 --> 38:54.633
- I think we're running
neck and neck,

38:54.666 --> 38:56.702
and it feels pretty amazing,

38:56.735 --> 38:58.770
but of course I wish
I was further ahead of Don.

38:58.804 --> 39:00.839
I wish his would
just spontaneously explode.

39:00.872 --> 39:02.808
- All right, gentlemen.
This is the strength test.

39:02.841 --> 39:05.377
Now, the scissor was used
in gladiatorial combat

39:05.411 --> 39:07.713
for both attack and defense.

39:07.746 --> 39:09.448
Now, to test
the strength and durability

39:09.481 --> 39:11.417
of your weapon,
we will clamp them

39:11.450 --> 39:12.718
into our mechanical device here.

39:12.751 --> 39:14.620
The blade's
going to come down

39:14.653 --> 39:17.623
and strike the armored cuff
of your weapon twice,

39:17.656 --> 39:18.824
and then your weapon's
going to be launched

39:18.857 --> 39:20.492
into this breastplate.

39:20.526 --> 39:21.927
Jason, I've already
got yours strapped in.

39:21.960 --> 39:22.994
So you ready to go?
- Let's do it.

39:23.028 --> 39:24.129
- Okay.

39:24.162 --> 39:28.133
*

39:28.166 --> 39:31.737
[machinery clanking]

39:33.171 --> 39:39.144
*

39:40.779 --> 39:42.948
- Just the slightest roll.

39:42.981 --> 39:46.051
It's not deformed
beyond being sharp.

39:46.084 --> 39:47.619
And then you can see--

39:47.653 --> 39:49.655
where the sword
came down and hit it,

39:49.688 --> 39:51.690
it caused a bit
of deformation,

39:51.723 --> 39:53.625
and then I think
we were pushed

39:53.659 --> 39:55.661
just a little further
offline.

39:55.694 --> 40:00.432
Right in here, it looks like
it kind of waffled just a bit.

40:00.466 --> 40:03.001
But everything
is still tight, still sharp.

40:03.034 --> 40:05.036
Nicely done.
- Thank you.

40:05.070 --> 40:07.138
My blade has made it all the way
through all three tests.

40:07.172 --> 40:08.774
I feel great about that.

40:08.807 --> 40:10.542
So now Don's up.

40:10.576 --> 40:12.711
If his fails,
then I'm good to go.

40:12.744 --> 40:13.912
If he makes it
all the way through,

40:13.945 --> 40:14.913
then it goes to a decision.

40:14.946 --> 40:16.615
- So, Don, you ready?

40:16.648 --> 40:18.016
- I'm ready.

40:18.049 --> 40:20.185
- All right,
let's get you strapped in.

40:20.218 --> 40:24.956
*

40:24.990 --> 40:27.926
[machinery clanking]

40:27.959 --> 40:34.866
*

40:34.900 --> 40:36.768
From looking at this,
I can--

40:36.802 --> 40:39.705
I'm having a hard time
finding where the sword hit it.

40:39.738 --> 40:43.074
And there's one
teeny little mark.

40:43.108 --> 40:44.976
The blade's still tight,

40:45.010 --> 40:46.745
and that edge is
still a razorblade.

40:46.778 --> 40:47.946
There's no rolling at all.

40:47.979 --> 40:49.848
Very well done.
It's nice.

40:49.881 --> 40:51.783
- Thank you.

40:51.817 --> 40:54.686
*

40:54.720 --> 40:56.555
- Bladesmiths,
you've worked very hard

40:56.588 --> 40:59.124
to re-create weapons
that we've never seen here

40:59.157 --> 41:00.626
in the Forge before.

41:00.659 --> 41:02.561
However, in this competition,

41:02.594 --> 41:04.029
there can only be one
"Forged in Fire" champion.

41:04.062 --> 41:05.764
And that champion is...

41:05.797 --> 41:11.036
*

41:11.069 --> 41:12.738
Don.
Congratulations.

41:12.771 --> 41:14.072
You are
the "Forged in Fire" champion.

41:14.105 --> 41:16.141
- Yeah.
[laughs] Thank you.

41:16.174 --> 41:18.677
- Jason, unfortunately,
your blade did not make the cut.

41:18.710 --> 41:20.779
David Baker will explain.

41:20.812 --> 41:23.782
- Jason, what this came down to
was the strength test.

41:23.815 --> 41:26.251
It's a gladiator's weapon.
It's got to be strong.

41:26.284 --> 41:28.186
That rolled edge
and the deformation you took

41:28.219 --> 41:30.121
from the hit on the cuff--

41:30.155 --> 41:32.591
well, that's why
we're sending you home.

41:32.624 --> 41:35.093
- Jason,
please surrender your scissor.

41:35.126 --> 41:36.795
- I spent five days
making something

41:36.828 --> 41:38.897
I've never made before.

41:38.930 --> 41:41.833
I went up against a guy
who builds armor quite often.

41:41.867 --> 41:44.736
I held my own against him, and
I'm pretty proud of that fact.

41:44.770 --> 41:47.939
I loved every minute
of this experience.

41:47.973 --> 41:49.608
- Don, congratulations.

41:49.641 --> 41:51.309
You are the
"Forged in Fire" champion

41:51.342 --> 41:53.812
and will be receiving
that check for 10 grand.

41:53.845 --> 41:56.648
How do you feel right now?
- Man, I feel fantastic.

41:56.682 --> 41:58.750
It feels great to be
"Forged in Fire" champion.

41:58.784 --> 42:00.786
$10,000.

42:00.819 --> 42:02.621
I'd like to get
something nice for my wife.

42:02.654 --> 42:03.855
We kind of had a little fun,
you know,

42:03.889 --> 42:05.023
making jokes
at each other

42:05.056 --> 42:06.157
about Texas versus Oklahoma.

42:06.191 --> 42:07.626
Yeah, I'm glad to see

42:07.659 --> 42:08.960
Texas came out on top.
[laughs]

42:08.994 --> 42:10.896
Whoo!
[laughing]

42:10.929 --> 42:13.965
*
