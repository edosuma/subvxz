-That's right. [laughs]
John is on at nights.

10:14.178 --> 10:16.006
Uh, they said you could help me
carry some boxes.

10:16.050 --> 10:17.965
-No, I'm supposed to stay here.
-That's okay, I've got Jay.

10:18.008 --> 10:20.097
I just got to get some stuff
from my office. They said

10:20.141 --> 10:21.490
-I had to get it out today.
-What name...

10:21.533 --> 10:23.057
MARISSA:
Yeah. [laughs]

10:24.754 --> 10:27.583
-You're ridiculous.
-[both laugh]

10:31.369 --> 10:33.850
-You think it's the corner?
-We'll find out.

10:36.548 --> 10:38.202
-Doing a GSR wipe?
-Yup.

10:38.246 --> 10:39.943
Looks like there might be
gunshot residue there.

10:39.987 --> 10:41.423
Oh.

10:43.817 --> 10:46.776
It's weird seeing us
from the outside.

10:46.820 --> 10:49.736
I spend six years in that
building, and it seems so small.

10:49.779 --> 10:51.781
Want to look
for a place for this?

10:51.825 --> 10:53.174
Oh, yeah.

10:53.217 --> 10:55.306
-Motion-detector surveillance?
-Yup.

10:55.350 --> 10:57.874
I kind of miss this,

10:57.918 --> 11:00.616
-investigating.
-I thought you liked
being a lawyer.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.052
I do. It's just

11:02.096 --> 11:03.532
there's a lot of boredom, too.

11:03.575 --> 11:05.926
JAY:
Well, you can always do both.

11:07.449 --> 11:09.059
Will you check the angle?

11:12.759 --> 11:14.499
JAY:
Good.

11:14.543 --> 11:17.938
Uh, no, no, i-it's just...
He fell last Saturday, right?

11:17.981 --> 11:19.896
-Yes.
-And did you see it fall?

11:19.940 --> 11:23.204
-No.
-Okay, well, he was on the roof,

11:23.247 --> 11:25.772
-which is weird.
-Why is that weird?

11:25.815 --> 11:27.861
I heard he was trying
to hang a banner.

11:27.904 --> 11:30.646
Okay, well, maybe weird's
not the wrong word.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.170
He-he used a keycard
from this floor to get up there,

11:33.214 --> 11:34.563
so...

11:34.606 --> 11:36.173
How do you know that?

11:36.217 --> 11:38.567
Well, the company, it-it

11:38.610 --> 11:41.309
keeps a record of, um...

11:41.352 --> 11:44.355
of all the card key uses.

11:44.399 --> 11:45.748
Sorry.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.707
Sorry...

11:49.404 --> 11:52.929
-You okay there?
-Oh, yeah. Here it is.

11:52.973 --> 11:54.365
See, right there.

11:54.409 --> 11:56.977
10:35. That's him
going through the door,

11:57.020 --> 11:59.631
-the roof door.
-Okay.

11:59.675 --> 12:03.374
Right. It's just that
the corpse on the...

12:03.418 --> 12:06.595
on the street, the card key
wasn't on him.

12:06.638 --> 12:09.598
-Meaning?
-Someone from this floor

12:09.641 --> 12:13.428
used their card key to get him
up there on the roof,

12:13.471 --> 12:15.212
and that's... that's...

12:15.256 --> 12:17.127
That's what?

12:17.171 --> 12:19.564
Well, the parents are suing,

12:19.608 --> 12:23.481
so that makes this law firm,
you know, liable.

12:26.528 --> 12:28.312
I will be right back.

12:28.356 --> 12:29.661
Do you mind waiting
in there for me?

12:29.705 --> 12:31.925
Oh, sure.

12:31.968 --> 12:34.014
[sneezes] Oh, I'm sorry.

12:34.057 --> 12:36.538
Do you have any snacks? I can
feel my blood sugar plummeting.

12:36.581 --> 12:39.193
-So, we're being targeted?
-We're always being targeted.

12:39.236 --> 12:41.412
-What did the police say?
-[scoffs]

12:43.110 --> 12:45.590
They said they'll be back
to gather the bullets.

12:45.634 --> 12:47.505
Right, so, Jay,
what do you suggest?

12:47.549 --> 12:49.551
We put in a surveillance
camera in case

12:49.594 --> 12:50.944
someone comes back
into the building.

12:50.987 --> 12:54.034
I have it here on my cell phone,

12:54.077 --> 12:56.165
and I'm connecting with
some people who can help me

12:56.210 --> 12:57.733
find out more.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.343
What people?

12:59.387 --> 13:01.432
I'd rather not say
until I get more information.

13:01.476 --> 13:03.826
-I'm meeting them tonight.
-What's wrong?

13:03.870 --> 13:05.262
This building investigator.

13:05.306 --> 13:07.351
I think he's not as stupid
as he seems.

13:07.395 --> 13:08.831
-Who's this?
-LIZ: Someone that's, uh,

13:08.875 --> 13:11.007
investigating the man
that fell from the roof.

13:11.051 --> 13:12.356
Building management
is being sued

13:12.400 --> 13:14.010
for $18 million by the family,

13:14.054 --> 13:16.360
and I think they're
trying to scapegoat us.

13:16.404 --> 13:18.885
They said one of our card keys
let the activist on the roof.

13:18.928 --> 13:21.409
RI'CHARD:
Okay, let's not let
all this distract us.

13:21.452 --> 13:23.759
How far up are we
on the STR Laurie clients?

13:23.803 --> 13:25.935
We've got 50% committed.

13:25.979 --> 13:29.199
Good. Let's just keep going
before something bad happens.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.943
Thank you, gentlemen.

13:33.987 --> 13:36.816
Stick around,
I may need you later.

13:40.123 --> 13:42.996
Oh, wonderful.
This is all we need.

13:43.039 --> 13:45.040

13:47.522 --> 13:49.567

13:50.612 --> 13:52.353
Hello, David. What do you want?

13:52.396 --> 13:54.877
Ah, it's just that
I've been gone for so long,

13:54.921 --> 13:56.792
I thought I'd say hello.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.534
Someone accidentally left a mop
in the door handles upstairs.

13:59.577 --> 14:01.928
-We're busy, David.
-Well, I'll get right to it.

14:01.971 --> 14:03.930
I wanted to do this myself.

14:03.973 --> 14:07.803
STR Laurie is suing you
for breach of fiduciary duties.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.718
We're going to court
for an emergency

14:09.761 --> 14:11.154

14:17.813 --> 14:19.989
When Alicia and--
what-what's his name?

14:20.033 --> 14:22.383
-Cary.
-Right. Happy times.

14:22.426 --> 14:24.907
They tried to steal our clients.

Well, here we are again,

we're coming for you, Diane.

He enters the building

That's how long we have
to pick the van lock

17:34.140 --> 17:35.967

17:36.011 --> 17:38.405
This is a replica of his van.

17:38.448 --> 17:40.059
Once we gain access
to his account,

17:40.102 --> 17:42.365
we'll need to insert this virus.

No.

Uh, someone must've taken it.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.845
Okay.

19:10.888 --> 19:12.760
Well, uh, we could use the

19:12.803 --> 19:14.109

19:14.153 --> 19:15.719
-camera. Look at that?
-Nope.

19:15.763 --> 19:17.982
Never worked. It's all for show.

19:19.245 --> 19:20.855

20:02.636 --> 20:05.073

what does he want next?

20:05.116 --> 20:06.509

20:06.553 --> 20:08.424
-She witnessed the fall.
-LIZ: Okay.

20:08.468 --> 20:12.167
Well, let him talk to her,
but we will talk to Marissa.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.647
-I can talk to her.
-LIZ: No.

20:13.690 --> 20:15.692
No, no, no. We will talk to her.

20:15.736 --> 20:18.739
These are all
the STR Laurie clients.

20:18.782 --> 20:21.263
-Good luck.
-LIZ: Wait a minute, Marissa.

20:21.307 --> 20:23.439
We need you to take
a few days off.

20:23.483 --> 20:24.788
What? Why?

20:24.832 --> 20:26.486
LIZ:
We're worried about a lawsuit

20:26.529 --> 20:28.401
from the family of the protestor
who fell from the roof.

RI'CHARD:
The investigator's
coming after you.

20:30.359 --> 20:32.143
You may need to hire
yourself a lawyer.

20:32.187 --> 20:34.320
-What?
-You let the protester
on the roof.

20:34.363 --> 20:35.973
-No, I didn't.

don't go back to the office.

this. We're in enough trouble.

Mr. Cain, just this morning,

20:46.245 --> 20:50.161

of phone calls to our clients

20:50.205 --> 20:53.034
telling them that STR Laurie
was failing?

20:53.077 --> 20:55.863
Failing is a strong word. I...

20:55.906 --> 20:58.431
What word did you use?
Please tell.

20:58.474 --> 21:00.607
I might've said, uh...

21:00.650 --> 21:02.652
"in trouble," uh,
"facing difficulties."

21:02.696 --> 21:05.002
And we all know this is the kind

21:05.046 --> 21:06.874
of poisonous slander

21:06.917 --> 21:09.050
that can bring down
the mightiest of firms.

21:22.063 --> 21:23.804
to the nature
of these difficulties?

21:23.847 --> 21:26.067
Objection. Relevance.

21:26.110 --> 21:28.330
STR Laurie's difficulties are
completely relevant, Your Honor.

if you're telling the truth.
-ROMANO: I'm listening.

21:34.031 --> 21:36.947
for James Winston
and Osman bin Ansari,

21:36.991 --> 21:40.255
the managing partners
of STR Laurie?

21:40.299 --> 21:41.517
That is correct.

21:41.561 --> 21:43.084
And isn't it your obligation

21:43.127 --> 21:44.912
to let the clients know
about these events?

21:44.955 --> 21:47.349
Well, as attorneys,
we have obligations to

21:47.393 --> 21:48.916
-all our clients.
-LIZ: And doesn't that

21:48.959 --> 21:51.135

21:51.179 --> 21:53.442
all fiduciary duties
to STR Laurie?

21:53.486 --> 21:55.879
DAVID:
Your Honor, this is
completely disingenuous.

21:55.923 --> 21:58.534
These lawyers
stole our client list

21:58.578 --> 22:00.188
specifically to pick off

22:00.231 --> 22:01.755
-our clients one by one.
-RI'CHARD: How can we steal

22:01.798 --> 22:03.974
a client list that was
already shared with us?

22:04.018 --> 22:06.499
Mr. Lee?

22:06.542 --> 22:09.502
I... because
they are calculated.

22:09.545 --> 22:12.374
They can be in the firm
and steal...

No, no, sir.
This is not a legal buffet.

22:14.637 --> 22:16.422
Either you are all one firm,

22:16.465 --> 22:17.988
and you're suing for fiduciary

22:18.032 --> 22:19.686

22:19.729 --> 22:21.122
you're separate,
and you're suing

22:21.165 --> 22:22.993

Which is it?

22:23.037 --> 22:25.387
I... [stammers]

22:25.431 --> 22:28.129
Tortious interference.
I want to amend our complaint.

22:28.172 --> 22:31.088
Your Honor, that requires
proof of intent.

22:31.132 --> 22:32.655
Yes, thank you,
I actually knew that.

22:32.699 --> 22:34.309
Mr. Lee, can you prove intent?

22:36.442 --> 22:38.792
I can. I will, later today.

22:38.835 --> 22:42.099

the way they talk to me,

-You'd be great there.

24:13.016 --> 24:14.453
Ah...

24:14.496 --> 24:17.543
-Prejudice much?
-Zev, I was there.

24:17.586 --> 24:20.589
There's just as much misogyny
there as here, more really.

24:28.554 --> 24:30.207

24:30.251 --> 24:31.948
Is that the new
Birthright technique?

24:31.992 --> 24:34.211
Yes. Did it work?

24:36.213 --> 24:38.781
-I was sitting here
when he fell.
-Okay.

24:38.825 --> 24:40.740
Uh-huh, and, um,

24:40.783 --> 24:43.394
what could you see
from your vantage point?

24:43.438 --> 24:45.614
I turned when I heard

24:45.658 --> 24:47.355
the... the sound, and then I

24:47.398 --> 24:49.400
saw the...

24:49.444 --> 24:51.794
the victim before he

24:51.838 --> 24:53.448
slid off the edge.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.450
Oh. All right.

24:55.494 --> 24:59.149
And, um, what were you
doing here at your desk?

24:59.193 --> 25:01.369
Nothing.

25:01.412 --> 25:03.153
You were just sitting there?

25:03.197 --> 25:05.460
No, I was on the phone.

25:05.504 --> 25:08.376
Oh, okay. Uh, with whom?

25:10.117 --> 25:13.033
My doctor.
His voice mail, actually.

25:13.076 --> 25:14.513
Right. Okay.

25:14.556 --> 25:16.427
Uh, what-what's his name?

25:18.734 --> 25:20.562
-Is this important?
-I don't know.

25:20.606 --> 25:22.782
Maybe. Could be.

25:22.825 --> 25:24.479
What's his name?

25:26.829 --> 25:29.484
Dr. Lyle Bettencourt.

25:30.920 --> 25:33.706
All right, and, um...

25:33.749 --> 25:36.056
are you, uh...

25:36.099 --> 25:38.537
currently on any medication,
Ms. Lockhart?

25:38.580 --> 25:40.103
This is needlessly invasive.

25:40.147 --> 25:42.889
Well, one of the charges
is-is that the

25:42.932 --> 25:45.979
fallen protestor, uh,

25:46.022 --> 25:48.764
could've been saved
before he fell from the, uh...

25:48.808 --> 25:50.418
wh-what do you call that?

25:50.461 --> 25:53.552
Balustrade. No. He couldn't.
He was already dead.

25:53.595 --> 25:56.119
-But you said you saw nothing.
-DIANE: No.

25:56.163 --> 25:58.818
I said I saw nothing
of the fall,

25:58.861 --> 26:02.169
but I did see that
he was dead there.

26:02.212 --> 26:04.606
KYLE:
Right. Okay.

26:06.129 --> 26:07.957
Are you currently
on any medication?

26:08.001 --> 26:10.351
Again, this is
needlessly invasive.

26:10.394 --> 26:12.701
Well, you see, Dr. Bettencourt

26:12.745 --> 26:15.791
works at a private
concierge clinic called

26:15.835 --> 26:18.794
Mind Trip, and, um, well,

26:18.838 --> 26:20.927
it-it-it deals
in an experimental

26:20.970 --> 26:23.886
treatment called PT-108.

26:23.930 --> 26:25.540
Okay, I...

26:25.584 --> 26:27.760
think I'll call a halt to this

26:27.803 --> 26:29.588
-right now.
-Well, just one more question.

26:29.631 --> 26:31.459
No.

26:31.502 --> 26:33.200
And you seem
to have lost all your

26:33.243 --> 26:35.550
awkwardness, "Kyle."

26:35.594 --> 26:38.118
Well, when I get interested
in a case,

26:38.161 --> 26:40.381
it sharpens my mind.

26:40.424 --> 26:43.079
-[phone buzzing]
-Woops.

26:43.123 --> 26:45.821
Uh, go ahead right in.
I'll-I'll be right with you.

26:45.865 --> 26:48.476
-Diane?
-DIANE: Lyle, hi.

26:48.519 --> 26:50.913
Um, I need a favor.

26:50.957 --> 26:53.481
I'm being questioned
in a case as a witness.

26:53.524 --> 26:55.352
-Sounds serious.
-No.

26:55.396 --> 26:57.093
No, it happens all the time.

26:57.137 --> 27:00.793
The investigator
is suggesting that the PT-108

27:00.836 --> 27:03.404
is affecting my judgment.

27:03.447 --> 27:06.712
Can you send me anything
from my files to dispute that?

27:06.755 --> 27:08.104
Sure.

27:08.148 --> 27:09.802
Uh, the only thing is,
I can't email

27:09.845 --> 27:11.586
a patient's medical record.

27:11.630 --> 27:14.328
I could, uh, bring it to you.

27:15.721 --> 27:18.593
Uh, good. Uh, great.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.726
But, um...

27:20.769 --> 27:23.816
Listen, um, not to the office.

27:24.991 --> 27:27.776
Uh, wherever you like.
I'm with a patient right now,

27:27.820 --> 27:30.518
but, um, later on tonight?

Yes. Uh, thank you.

Uh, yes.

27:40.920 --> 27:43.313

And in Jesus' name
we pray, amen.

28:20.046 --> 28:21.090

28:21.134 --> 28:22.875
Thank you, Jesus.

28:22.918 --> 28:25.094
Ri'Chard,

28:25.138 --> 28:26.748
what do you get out of it?

28:26.792 --> 28:29.533
Um... what, prayer?

28:29.577 --> 28:30.665
Yes.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.711
God. Religion.

28:32.754 --> 28:34.538
What does it do for you?

28:34.582 --> 28:36.889
It doesn't do anything for me

28:36.932 --> 28:38.586
because it's not transactional.

28:38.629 --> 28:40.719
I pray because there is a God,

28:40.762 --> 28:44.113
and he desires
that I acknowledge Him.

28:44.157 --> 28:46.812
And you get a sense
of peace from it?

28:46.855 --> 28:47.943
Yes.

28:47.987 --> 28:49.902

Oh, you're not religious?

28:57.823 --> 28:58.998
No.

But I met someone who is.

29:06.135 --> 29:07.658

29:07.702 --> 29:10.661
Well, I don't know
what your friend feels,

29:10.705 --> 29:12.794
but I like having
a straight line in my life.

29:12.838 --> 29:14.622
Something constant.

29:14.665 --> 29:17.451
Like, uh, the double line
on a highway.

29:19.627 --> 29:22.978
I want to believe in God, but...

29:23.022 --> 29:25.851
I don't like the way
God is used.

29:25.894 --> 29:28.941
I know, but...

29:28.984 --> 29:31.813
people will always be bad.

29:31.857 --> 29:34.816
Even without God,

29:34.860 --> 29:36.557
they'll go on

29:36.600 --> 29:39.952
hurting each other
and killing each other.

29:39.995 --> 29:42.345
Do you want to pray with me?

29:44.173 --> 29:45.435
No.

29:45.479 --> 29:47.698
-Why?
-Well...

29:47.742 --> 29:49.439
[chuckles] Because...

29:49.483 --> 29:53.008
I don't believe,
so it would feel hypocritical.

29:54.662 --> 29:56.055
You're gonna die.

29:57.317 --> 29:59.275
-Well, that's true.
-[both laugh]

29:59.319 --> 30:00.886
And when you die,

30:00.929 --> 30:03.889
you'll have to face the thought:

30:03.932 --> 30:06.848

30:06.892 --> 30:09.242
All the things I've done.

30:09.285 --> 30:12.723
All the things I believed.

30:12.767 --> 30:16.205
Eventually,
it just comes down to...

30:16.249 --> 30:18.904
you and God.

30:22.168 --> 30:24.126
Ri'Chard, um,

30:24.170 --> 30:27.477
for the past three months,
I've been treated for depression

30:27.521 --> 30:30.872
with a therapeutic
called PT-108.

30:33.135 --> 30:36.225
-What is that?
-It's a light hallucinogenic.

30:36.269 --> 30:38.662
It's administered
under the supervision

30:38.706 --> 30:40.577
of a medical doctor,

30:40.621 --> 30:43.885

against us.

30:46.409 --> 30:49.195
Has it impacted
your perception, your work?

30:49.238 --> 30:52.633
No, it hasn't, and I'm gathering
medical records to prove that.

30:52.676 --> 30:54.940
And I'm finished
with the treatments,

30:54.983 --> 30:57.290
so it won't be an issue
moving forward.

Your Honor, I have evidence
that Reddick lawyers

34:16.228 --> 34:18.708
intended to poach clients away
from STR Laurie

34:18.752 --> 34:21.362
-all along.
-All right, let's see it.

34:21.407 --> 34:25.018
STR Laurie was worried
about how Reddick

34:25.063 --> 34:27.978
was being managed.
They asked me to

34:28.022 --> 34:30.545

They asked me...
-Objection, Your Honor!

34:30.590 --> 34:32.722
...to record their conversations
in their offices and hallway...

34:32.766 --> 34:34.333
Your Honor,
they're-they're bugging us.

34:34.376 --> 34:36.378
Which is our right.
Read your partnership agreement.

Hold on, everybody.
I will hear this evidence

34:40.339 --> 34:41.643
and decide on its merit.

Let's just save
all our objections

I've actually heard...

about your little vendetta
against my father,

I shared something with you

It wasn't that hard. We'd been
following him for weeks.

You hear me? You're done!

43:35.090 --> 43:37.310
A few years ago,

43:37.353 --> 43:40.400
my sister became frustrated

43:40.443 --> 43:42.532
with the police and the courts.

43:42.576 --> 43:46.232
She felt they weren't
serving the community needs.

43:46.275 --> 43:48.190
You must feel the same.

43:48.234 --> 43:52.107
The police were
supposed to return today

43:52.151 --> 43:55.763
to retrieve bullets
from your office. They did not.

43:55.807 --> 43:59.593
My sister, frustrated,

43:59.637 --> 44:02.378

This operation
is built on her work.

44:17.742 --> 44:21.267
Vinetta's only problem was
she didn't think big enough.

44:21.310 --> 44:24.096
Some wealthy
men and women came together

44:24.139 --> 44:25.793
and helped finance this.

Wh-- You're gonna
prosecute them here?

44:27.969 --> 44:28.927
No.

44:28.970 --> 44:31.712
But we do need a lawyer

44:31.756 --> 44:33.018
from your firm.

44:33.061 --> 44:34.846
Why?

44:34.889 --> 44:37.631
-[siren wailing over speaker]

44:37.675 --> 44:40.329

[indistinct radio chatter]

44:42.157 --> 44:44.290

RENETTA:
Good job.

45:07.226 --> 45:08.836
Darker.

45:25.200 --> 45:26.680
[buzzer sounds]

45:26.724 --> 45:28.464
[gate slides closed]

45:28.508 --> 45:31.554
[indistinct announcements
over P.A.]

45:31.598 --> 45:33.731
Holding cell number two.

45:35.645 --> 45:38.300
[buzzer sounds]

45:50.748 --> 45:53.794
We need information, and
we need your help getting it.

45:53.838 --> 45:54.926
MAN [over video]:
Where's my lawyer?

45:54.969 --> 45:56.231
I want to see my lawyer.

45:56.275 --> 45:58.364
Let me make a call!

46:02.585 --> 46:05.588
-[Diane chuckles]
-LYLE: Woops. [laughs]

46:05.632 --> 46:07.373
DIANE:
So, I-I must confess,

46:07.416 --> 46:09.679
I didn't need
those files after all.

46:09.723 --> 46:11.420
Well, I must confess, there's
nothing in that envelope.

46:11.464 --> 46:14.206
[laughs]

46:14.249 --> 46:16.556
So, um...

46:16.599 --> 46:20.647
Doctor, this isn't improper?
Drinking together.

46:20.690 --> 46:24.085
No, I'm not your doctor anymore.
But how are?

46:24.129 --> 46:26.566
I'm actually doing

46:26.609 --> 46:28.002
really well,

46:28.046 --> 46:29.961
and I still have your dorje.

46:30.004 --> 46:31.658
Have you meditated?

46:32.877 --> 46:35.096
No. I mean, it's just...

46:35.140 --> 46:37.446
it's just too hard at work.

46:37.490 --> 46:39.753
And I don't know
what I'd do with it.

46:39.797 --> 46:43.713
Uh, calm your mind,
find some peace.

46:43.757 --> 46:46.107
Yeah.

46:46.151 --> 46:49.807
My sense is that I...
I don't want to find peace.

46:49.850 --> 46:51.286
Yeah, why is that?

46:51.330 --> 46:53.636
I don't know.
It would seem hypocritical,

46:53.680 --> 46:56.988
feeling at peace
when the world is so...

46:57.031 --> 46:58.990
not.

46:59.033 --> 47:01.470
Maybe you need to be at peace
to work on the world.

47:02.689 --> 47:05.997
You know, there's a-a
meditation center in Michigan.

47:06.040 --> 47:08.434
Great Lakes Bay Reserve.

47:08.477 --> 47:11.524
-You should go.
-Mm, I've been.

47:11.567 --> 47:13.308
Really?

47:13.352 --> 47:15.833
Yes, but not to meditate.

47:15.876 --> 47:17.878
To, um... to hunt.

47:17.922 --> 47:19.619
You hunt? [chuckles]

47:19.662 --> 47:22.752
Yes. Well, I...

47:22.796 --> 47:25.407
I did, and then a partner
at my firm got shot,

47:25.451 --> 47:27.192
-and I-- so I-I stopped.
-Oh.

47:27.235 --> 47:29.150
Sorry.

47:29.194 --> 47:32.762
No. It's just there are
too many guns out there anyway.

47:32.806 --> 47:34.329
Yeah, NRA.

47:36.114 --> 47:38.856
They just don't give a damn
how many kids get killed.

47:42.947 --> 47:43.991
Mm.

47:46.428 --> 47:49.518

47:49.562 --> 47:53.435

47:53.479 --> 47:56.395
Are we getting more comfortable?

47:56.438 --> 47:59.528
No. Those are
some workmates, and

47:59.572 --> 48:01.748
they can be nosy.

48:01.791 --> 48:03.097
LYLE:
About your doctor?

48:03.141 --> 48:05.056
Yes.

48:06.274 --> 48:08.929
No, about everything.

48:08.973 --> 48:11.192
Well, I know you're married,
Diane. I'm just...

48:11.236 --> 48:13.107
-having a drink with you.
-[laughs]

48:13.151 --> 48:15.196
I know. It's-it's
really not-- Ooh.

[laughs]

48:17.068 --> 48:18.896
[Diane mutters]

48:24.640 --> 48:26.816
How long are we
gonna stay like this?

48:26.860 --> 48:30.690
Just... I don't know,
just a few minutes.

48:30.733 --> 48:32.953
Just pretend we're having
a casual conversation...

48:32.997 --> 48:36.130
-[laughing]
-...with our faces
pressed into the couch.

48:36.174 --> 48:38.872
This is normal. Oh, look.

48:38.916 --> 48:42.832
Pretend we're looking
for the keys to the car.

48:44.182 --> 48:46.575
Are they gone?

48:46.619 --> 48:49.100
DIANE:
I don't know.
