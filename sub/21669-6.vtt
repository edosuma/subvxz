00:00.912 --> 00:03.080
<i>(Male announcer)
Previously on Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:03.081 --> 00:04.281
I'm blue now, man!

00:04.282 --> 00:05.782
(Announcer)
Roshni joined the blue team...

00:05.783 --> 00:07.451
Welcome to team blue.

00:07.452 --> 00:09.486
(Announcer) And left behind
a splintered red team.

00:09.487 --> 00:11.188
Nobody's talking to each other.
Nobody's communicating.

00:11.189 --> 00:12.556
It's gonna start getting dirty.

00:12.557 --> 00:14.291
We all hate each other.

00:14.292 --> 00:16.560
(Announcer) In the gourmet
Mexican challenge...

00:16.561 --> 00:18.528
You'll be turning
Mexican classics

00:18.529 --> 00:20.230
into fine dining food.

00:20.231 --> 00:22.199
(Announcer) Patrick made
an executive decision...

00:22.200 --> 00:23.700
Whose dish are you dropping?

00:23.701 --> 00:25.335
Guys, I'm going with Royce's.

00:25.336 --> 00:27.237
(Announcer) Choosing Royce's
taco dish over Brian's.

00:27.238 --> 00:28.772
You gotta be [bleep]
kidding me, man.

00:28.773 --> 00:30.207
(Announcer) A decision...

00:30.208 --> 00:31.441
<i>The one thing that
doesn't attract me</i>

00:31.442 --> 00:32.576
is the greasiness
of the tortilla.

00:32.577 --> 00:34.711
(Announcer) The whole
team came to regret.

00:34.712 --> 00:36.179
I'm gonna have to go with
the red team on this one.

00:36.180 --> 00:37.948
<i>Congratulations, red team.</i>

00:37.949 --> 00:39.249
(Announcer) And they won
their fourth challenge

00:39.250 --> 00:40.784
out of the last five,

00:40.785 --> 00:43.153
causing the blue team to
question Patrick's leadership.

00:43.154 --> 00:45.289
I'm asking you questions,
you just walk away from me.

00:45.290 --> 00:47.324
If you're gonna take
the [bleep] lead, lead.

00:47.325 --> 00:48.892
That's like the tenth time!

00:48.893 --> 00:50.093
I've got everybody
asking me questions.

00:50.094 --> 00:51.361
I'm trying to give directions.

00:51.362 --> 00:52.796
(Announcer) At dinner service,

00:52.797 --> 00:54.631
Dana and Kimmie
were at each other's throats.

00:54.632 --> 00:56.533
(Kimmie)
I'm ready to kill this bitch.

00:56.534 --> 00:58.001
Come hit me if you want.
Get off my station.

00:58.002 --> 01:00.570
Kimmie, like, for a big girl,
is a big baby.

01:00.571 --> 01:02.406
(Announcer) Barbie had
trouble communicating.

01:02.407 --> 01:03.707
You just said you were ready!

01:03.708 --> 01:05.242
The mussels are overcooked!

01:05.242 --> 01:07.010
And she doesn't give a [bleep].

01:07.011 --> 01:08.245
(Announcer)
And Danielle's confidence...

01:08.246 --> 01:09.179
Yo, my pork is like the bomb.

01:09.180 --> 01:10.747
(Announcer)
Was severely misplaced.

01:10.748 --> 01:11.915
<i>All of you!
Yes, chef?</i>

01:11.916 --> 01:13.750
Stop! Raw pork!

01:13.751 --> 01:14.818
I felt really bad for the pig.

01:14.819 --> 01:16.153
Raw!

01:16.154 --> 01:18.955
The pig didn't do it.
It was Danielle.

01:18.956 --> 01:21.124
(Announcer) On the blue team,
Guy started the team off

01:21.125 --> 01:22.392
on the wrong foot.

01:22.393 --> 01:24.828
Come here! Touch that!

01:24.829 --> 01:26.263
Get it back in the oven!

01:26.264 --> 01:27.798
(Announcer)
From there, they made...

01:27.799 --> 01:29.199
<i>What are you doing, young man?</i>

01:29.200 --> 01:30.200
(Announcer) Mistake...

01:30.201 --> 01:31.301
Talk to me, Guy!

01:31.302 --> 01:32.736
(Announcer) After mistake...

01:32.737 --> 01:33.670
<i>Thank you so much,
chef Patrick,</i>

01:33.671 --> 01:35.205
for a great sabotage.

01:35.206 --> 01:36.440
(Announcer)
Forcing chef Ramsay...

01:36.441 --> 01:37.774
Piss off!

01:37.775 --> 01:39.476
(Announcer)
To get rid of the weak links.

01:39.477 --> 01:40.944
Get out.

01:40.945 --> 01:43.146
Chef Ramsay is on, like,
a kicking-out spree tonight.

01:43.147 --> 01:44.281
Get out!

01:44.282 --> 01:45.315
Piss off!

01:45.316 --> 01:47.184
Get out!
Get out of here.

01:47.185 --> 01:49.119
Sorry.
I don't care.

01:49.120 --> 01:51.321
Both teams lose.
Let's get that right.

01:51.322 --> 01:52.889
(Announcer)
Blue team nominated...

01:52.890 --> 01:53.790
Pat.
(Announcer) And...

01:53.791 --> 01:54.925
Guy.

01:54.926 --> 01:56.185
(Announcer)
The red team nominated...

01:56.186 --> 01:57.697
Dani, chef.
(Announcer) And...

01:57.698 --> 01:58.228
Me, chef.

01:58.229 --> 02:00.764
(Announcer) But Barbie made
a convincing argument.

02:00.765 --> 02:02.432
I don't feel like
I deserve to be here.

02:02.433 --> 02:03.934
You know what?
You're right.

02:03.935 --> 02:05.302
Back in line.

02:05.303 --> 02:06.603
(Announcer) Find out right now

02:06.604 --> 02:07.838
if the blue team loses

02:07.839 --> 02:09.538
their self-appointed
leader, Patrick,

02:09.539 --> 02:11.708
or catering chef, Guy.

02:11.709 --> 02:16.046
Or will it be Dana and Christina's
close ally, Danielle?

02:16.047 --> 02:18.482
Find out who will
lose their chance

02:18.483 --> 02:21.118
to become head chef
at Gordon Ramsay Steak

02:21.119 --> 02:22.119
at Paris, Las Vegas.

<i>(Announcer) And now the
continuation of Hell's Kitchen.</i>

03:24.348 --> 03:27.217
Tonight, both teams
have had to nominate

03:27.218 --> 03:28.885
two members for elimination.

03:28.886 --> 03:30.253
Back in line.

03:30.254 --> 03:33.023
But Barbie has been
granted a reprieve.

03:33.024 --> 03:34.024
Okay.

03:35.493 --> 03:37.160
My decision is...

03:42.097 --> 03:43.645
Patrick.

03:45.842 --> 03:48.071
Back in line.
Thank you, chef.

03:51.042 --> 03:52.909
The person leaving
Hell's Kitchen is...

03:55.146 --> 03:57.747
Danielle.

03:57.748 --> 03:58.815
Time to go.

03:58.816 --> 04:00.217
Give me your jacket, please.

04:02.453 --> 04:03.720
Thank you.
Good night.

04:03.721 --> 04:05.655
Good night.

04:09.694 --> 04:11.461
I'm... honestly,
I'm pissed off.

04:11.462 --> 04:13.096
I don't deserve to go home.

04:13.097 --> 04:15.565
Kimmie and Barbie,
they're sneaky.

04:15.566 --> 04:18.000
They're out for themselves.
They're fake.

04:18.002 --> 04:19.302
I would love to see Dana win.

04:19.303 --> 04:20.704
She's a strong cook,

04:20.704 --> 04:22.072
and I hope that she
makes it to the end.

04:23.374 --> 04:24.441
What's wrong, Dana?

04:24.442 --> 04:25.942
I'm upset, chef.

04:25.943 --> 04:27.110
<i>You're upset?</i>

04:27.111 --> 04:28.345
Nowhere near as much as I am.

04:28.346 --> 04:30.614
<i>Tonight's performance</i>

04:30.615 --> 04:32.916
was embarrassing.

04:32.917 --> 04:34.484
I've got one question
for you all.

04:34.485 --> 04:35.585
Are you ready to fight back?

04:35.586 --> 04:36.720
(All) Yes, chef!

04:36.721 --> 04:37.754
I can't hear you.

04:37.755 --> 04:38.822
(All) Yes, chef!

04:38.823 --> 04:39.823
I still can't hear you.

04:39.824 --> 04:40.724
(All) Yes, chef!

04:40.725 --> 04:41.791
Sweet dreams.

04:41.792 --> 04:43.059
Now [bleep] off.

04:43.060 --> 04:46.696
Danielle was
my best friend here,

04:46.697 --> 04:48.532
[crying] and she's gone.

04:48.533 --> 04:50.467
I feel devastated right now.

04:50.468 --> 04:51.935
[Blows nose]

04:51.936 --> 04:53.803
(Patrick) Chef Ramsay
keeps calling me out,

04:53.804 --> 04:55.906
asking me, am I beaten?
Am I tired?

04:55.907 --> 04:58.241
I'm not beaten or tired.
I'm geared up, I'm ready,

04:58.242 --> 05:00.110
I'm amped,
and I'm here to win it.

05:01.779 --> 05:03.547
<i>I just feel like, now,</i>

05:03.548 --> 05:06.416
like, I have you, and, like,
I have nobody else.

05:06.417 --> 05:08.618
I'm right here, girl.
I'm not going anywhere.

05:08.619 --> 05:11.888
You know the three of them
are [bleep] sticking together.

05:11.889 --> 05:13.990
They're not putting each other
up there for [bleep].

05:13.991 --> 05:18.028
I know that
the Kimmie-Tiffany-Robyn alliance

05:18.029 --> 05:20.463
is definitely gonna
target me next.

05:23.301 --> 05:25.435
I don't want to see it
get personal.

05:25.436 --> 05:27.137
I hope, for their own
well being,

05:27.138 --> 05:28.905
that I don't get pushed
to that point.

05:28.906 --> 05:30.840
'Cause I think
it's gonna get real ugly.

05:30.841 --> 05:32.909
Now it's not just
a [bleep] competition.

05:32.910 --> 05:34.678
It's a competition
and it's a [bleep] game.

05:34.679 --> 05:35.879
Yeah.

05:35.880 --> 05:37.914
I feel like I have
a target on my back,

05:37.915 --> 05:41.017
so Kimmie and Tiffany,
it's on, bitches.

05:41.018 --> 05:43.019
From here on out, it is on.

05:43.020 --> 05:45.322
I mean, there's no more
playing nice.

05:45.323 --> 05:47.157
<i>Dana thinks she's gonna win.</i>

05:47.158 --> 05:49.259
I'm sorry that Dana
feels threatened by me,

05:49.260 --> 05:51.695
but I'm not going anywhere,
so she can kiss my ass.

05:51.696 --> 05:53.496
Dana and Christina
are gonna blame us

05:53.497 --> 05:55.198
for putting up Danielle.

05:55.199 --> 05:57.167
We're all kinds
of divided right now.

05:57.168 --> 05:59.369
Christina and Dana,
they're all sad and [bleep].

05:59.370 --> 06:01.237
Time to pluck them bitches out.

06:01.238 --> 06:03.039
I already got one out.
Now I got two more to go.

06:03.040 --> 06:07.043
Her crying after Danielle left,
that just shows weakness.

06:07.044 --> 06:09.212
(Tiffany) This is a competition,
and if you can't handle it,

06:09.213 --> 06:10.780
then get the [bleep] out.

06:10.781 --> 06:12.582
(Announcer)
While the red team is split up

06:12.583 --> 06:14.084
into two clear alliances,

06:14.085 --> 06:15.952
one member of the blue team...

06:15.953 --> 06:18.254
You're our leader,
and I felt that you don't.

06:18.255 --> 06:20.256
(Announcer)
Has selected a scapegoat.

06:20.257 --> 06:22.525
I don't feel that Patrick's
really leading.

06:22.526 --> 06:25.295
There should be things
poppin' in your head quicker.

06:25.296 --> 06:26.630
And they're not.
He's an old man.

06:26.631 --> 06:27.564
He needs to go home.

06:27.565 --> 06:29.065
I'm gonna say something,

06:29.066 --> 06:30.467
<i>being that,
in the past couple days,</i>

06:30.468 --> 06:32.135
<i>even with the day of prep,</i>

06:32.136 --> 06:34.537
you know, and the way
we should get it done...

06:34.538 --> 06:36.339
Royce just talks.

06:36.340 --> 06:37.674
<i>I'll put my name up there</i>

06:37.675 --> 06:39.442
if you guys want a new leader.

06:39.443 --> 06:40.443
He talks a lot.

06:40.444 --> 06:42.545
If that's what you feel,
then that's fine.

06:42.546 --> 06:44.581
If not, then that's fine too.

06:44.582 --> 06:46.216
I don't see him as a leader.

06:46.217 --> 06:47.884
He talks, "I'm like this,
I'm like that.

06:47.885 --> 06:49.452
I'm like this,
I'm like that, that, that."

06:49.453 --> 06:51.054
Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.
I-I-I, blah blah-blah blah.

06:51.055 --> 06:53.056
Shut the [bleep] up.

06:53.057 --> 06:55.325
This team has gotten
better and stronger

06:55.326 --> 06:56.893
because of my leadership.

06:56.894 --> 06:58.561
You have done
certain things very well.

06:58.562 --> 07:00.630
<i>But I feel, at certain times,</i>

07:00.631 --> 07:02.599
<i>you've just taken a left
and everybody's taken a right.</i>

07:02.600 --> 07:04.634
<i>You know what?
I don't sit around and play</i>

07:04.635 --> 07:07.337
armchair quarterback
on somebody's decisions.

07:07.338 --> 07:08.605
Hey, Royce, [bleep] you.

07:08.606 --> 07:09.939
I don't trust him.

07:09.940 --> 07:11.508
I don't think
anybody trusts him.

07:11.509 --> 07:12.942
He's gonna sell us all out
soon enough.

07:12.943 --> 07:14.911
Every day, when you said
you were [bleep] leader,

07:14.912 --> 07:17.047
have I not pushed
as hard as I [bleep] can?

07:17.048 --> 07:19.249
Shut up, dude.
Shut up!

07:19.250 --> 07:21.818
I look at Patrick,
and he's about to go crazy.

07:21.819 --> 07:23.820
When you told me,
"you need to to this,

07:23.821 --> 07:25.121
you need to do this, you
need to do this for garnish,"

07:25.122 --> 07:26.956
and I still had fish to go...

07:26.957 --> 07:28.191
And I still set up
the [bleep] fish station.

07:28.192 --> 07:29.993
All I did was [bleep] push!

07:29.994 --> 07:31.895
And you don't even give
a [bleep] anyway.

07:31.896 --> 07:33.896
(Patrick)
That's called a [bleep] mistake!

07:34.866 --> 07:37.401
(Announcer)
After a tense elimination,

07:37.402 --> 07:39.270
both teams are more
fractured than ever.

07:42.374 --> 07:44.308
(Announcer)
On the blue team, Royce...

07:44.309 --> 07:46.143
You're our leader,
and I felt that you don't.

07:46.144 --> 07:48.212
(Announcer) Sees an opportunity
to take the leadership role

07:48.213 --> 07:49.580
away from Patrick.

07:49.581 --> 07:51.582
When you told me,
"you need to do this,

07:51.583 --> 07:52.950
you need to to this, you
need to do this for garnish,"

07:52.951 --> 07:54.318
and I still had fish to go.

07:54.319 --> 07:56.654
<i>That's called
a [bleep] mistake!</i>

07:56.655 --> 07:59.290
(Patrick) Nobody wants him to
lead the team, that's the thing.

07:59.291 --> 08:01.992
Nobody has faith in Royce
whatsoever.

08:01.993 --> 08:03.494
Everybody, including myself,

08:03.495 --> 08:04.862
<i>at point in service has gotten</i>

08:04.863 --> 08:06.130
frazzled over [bleep]!

08:06.131 --> 08:07.598
And that's
the realization of it.

08:07.599 --> 08:09.166
Every one of us
needs to wake up.

08:09.167 --> 08:11.035
<i>Man up, get over it,
and let's move on!</i>

08:11.036 --> 08:12.469
<i>Man, we need to win tomorrow.</i>

08:12.470 --> 08:14.038
<i>[I ain't shovelin' bleep]</i>

08:14.039 --> 08:16.473
Chasin' [bleep] sheep,
but diggin' up trees no more.

08:16.474 --> 08:18.042
I just ain't [bleep] doin' it.

08:18.043 --> 08:19.476
We need to dial it down a notch

08:19.477 --> 08:21.579
and just take a breather.

08:21.580 --> 08:23.681
Royce, to me,
is just puttin' on a show.

08:23.682 --> 08:25.416
I don't think he's ready
to be the leader right now.

08:25.417 --> 08:27.117
We all got attitude problems.

08:27.118 --> 08:28.786
We are not going
to win a challenge

08:28.787 --> 08:30.955
if we do not act as one.

08:30.956 --> 08:33.256
(Announcer) Royce was
unable to talk his way

08:33.258 --> 08:34.958
into the leadership
of the blue team.

08:38.163 --> 08:39.863
But with a new day,

08:39.864 --> 08:42.232
he hopes he'll be able
to talk his way into

08:42.232 --> 08:44.001
something else.

08:44.001 --> 08:45.269
Talk to me, girl.

08:46.504 --> 08:48.639
You don't?
You sure?

08:48.640 --> 08:50.474
If you wanna
take another shower

08:50.475 --> 08:51.976
and use me as a loofah,
you could.

08:51.977 --> 08:53.911
That's why he's not a leader.

08:53.912 --> 08:55.279
He's too immature.

08:55.280 --> 08:56.947
Yo, you better...

08:56.948 --> 08:58.282
Royce, I mean, seriously,

08:58.283 --> 08:59.783
let's try to focus.

08:59.784 --> 09:01.385
Otherwise, we're gonna
[Bleep] fail.

09:01.386 --> 09:02.486
Yes, chef.

09:02.487 --> 09:04.254
<i>Let's go, guys, right now.</i>

09:04.255 --> 09:05.255
<i>He wants us down
in the kitchen right now.</i>

09:05.256 --> 09:06.090
Tiffany, come on!

09:06.091 --> 09:07.291
I definitely think
that we can put

09:07.292 --> 09:08.993
whatever conflicts aside

09:08.994 --> 09:11.495
to focus on the challenge...
we've done that so far.

09:11.496 --> 09:14.032
(Announcer) While there is
dissention on both teams...

09:14.033 --> 09:16.033
Come on, guys.
(Announcer) The chefs know

09:16.034 --> 09:18.335
they must put it aside
and stay focused

09:18.336 --> 09:20.504
on what chef Ramsay
has in store for them.

09:20.505 --> 09:21.605
Right, good morning.

09:21.606 --> 09:23.073
(All) Morning, chef.

09:23.074 --> 09:24.908
<i>When I began
as a young chef in Paris,</i>

09:24.909 --> 09:26.677
<i>I can remember thinking
that French food was it.</i>

09:26.678 --> 09:28.278
<i>There was nothing better.</i>

09:28.279 --> 09:29.813
I don't know what
this is gonna be about,

09:29.814 --> 09:31.482
but I'm assuming it has
something to do

09:31.483 --> 09:33.117
with classical
French technique.

09:33.118 --> 09:35.219
It's, like,
one of the things I do best.

09:35.220 --> 09:36.720
<i>I honestly thought</i>

09:36.721 --> 09:38.322
the food that I was
learning and serving

09:38.323 --> 09:39.623
would never change.

09:39.624 --> 09:41.258
I don't know what's happening.

09:41.259 --> 09:42.793
What is this?

09:42.794 --> 09:44.895
<i>(Gordon) But you know
that food evolves,</i>

09:44.896 --> 09:46.463
and that it changes
like fashion, right?

09:47.599 --> 09:49.033
What are we doing?

09:49.034 --> 09:50.868
<i>Let's take a look
at a few examples</i>

09:50.869 --> 09:52.736
<i>of trends in the food business.</i>

09:52.737 --> 09:54.505
Let me show you what I mean.

09:54.506 --> 09:57.341
<i>In the 1950s, housewives
all across America</i>

09:57.342 --> 10:00.511
<i>were serving these crazy,
colorful dishes.</i>

10:00.512 --> 10:01.845
[Laughter]

10:01.846 --> 10:03.447
Is that you shaking,
or was it the jell-o?

10:03.448 --> 10:04.982
Oh, the jell-o's
supposed to shake.

10:04.983 --> 10:06.483
The jell-o's shaking.
Amazing.

10:06.484 --> 10:07.951
I don't know
what the [bleep]'s happening.

10:07.952 --> 10:09.787
You know, this beautiful girl
walks out

10:09.788 --> 10:11.188
in this sleek, nice dress,

10:11.189 --> 10:12.723
and she's carrying
a jell-o mold,

10:12.724 --> 10:14.158
and things are wiggling,
and believe me,

10:14.159 --> 10:15.693
it wasn't just the jell-o.

10:15.694 --> 10:17.528
You got a hot chick
or a jell-o mold.

10:17.529 --> 10:19.697
You got problems if you're
looking at the jell-o mold.

10:19.698 --> 10:22.700
<i>(Gordon) Also in the
'50s, the TV dinner.</i>

10:22.701 --> 10:25.102
<i>Clearly ideal for watching
in front of the telly,</i>

10:25.103 --> 10:27.504
<i>but let's be honest...
it tasted of crap, right?</i>

10:27.505 --> 10:29.707
(Dana) Maybe we're gonna have
to, like, recreate a TV dinner

10:29.708 --> 10:31.175
and make it fine dining?

10:31.176 --> 10:32.376
I'm just so confused.

10:32.377 --> 10:34.211
Time for our next model.

10:34.212 --> 10:36.080
<i>There was a type of food that
became highly fashionable</i>

10:36.081 --> 10:38.082
<i>in the 1970s...
the fondue.</i>

10:38.083 --> 10:40.250
We're gonna be
reinterpreting fondue.

10:40.251 --> 10:42.186
I hate fondue.
I've never liked fondue.

10:42.187 --> 10:43.554
I don't get fondue.

10:43.555 --> 10:44.822
You gotta melt some
kind of sauce

10:44.823 --> 10:46.090
that people dip [bleep] in.

10:46.091 --> 10:47.925
<i>(Gordon) I mean, it
spread like wildfire.</i>

10:47.926 --> 10:49.460
<i>Every restaurant,
everywhere in the country,</i>

10:49.461 --> 10:50.894
were putting fondues
on their menu.

10:50.895 --> 10:52.396
<i>It was trendy, it was hip,</i>

10:52.397 --> 10:54.164
and it was something to share.

10:54.165 --> 10:55.899
I have no idea what
the challenge is gonna be.

10:55.900 --> 10:58.268
But I am happy
to see these models.

10:58.269 --> 11:01.405
Hopefully, they want
to talk to us and... and cuddle.

11:01.406 --> 11:03.273
<i>(Gordon) And then, in the '90s,</i>

11:03.274 --> 11:05.776
<i>Asian fusion was born.</i>

11:05.777 --> 11:08.011
<i>The diners were expanding
their taste buds</i>

11:08.012 --> 11:09.513
<i>with dishes like this:</i>

11:09.514 --> 11:11.682
<i>Teriyaki tuna,
wasabi mashed potatoes,</i>

11:11.683 --> 11:13.217
<i>and it became a real trend</i>

11:13.218 --> 11:15.219
that fusion was here to stay.

11:15.220 --> 11:17.454
(Justin) Asian fusion doesn't
really excite me much.

11:17.455 --> 11:18.922
But hot ladies definitely do.

11:18.923 --> 11:20.691
<i>(Gordon) Isn't it amazing,</i>

11:20.692 --> 11:21.658
<i>when you just look
at those three dishes,</i>

11:21.659 --> 11:23.594
<i>how the food evolved?</i>

11:23.595 --> 11:25.295
Ladies, thank you
so much for coming

11:25.296 --> 11:26.063
and giving us a little insight.

11:26.064 --> 11:27.097
Good to see you.

11:29.434 --> 11:32.736
So we're gonna have to make
a dish for each era,

11:32.737 --> 11:34.772
and I'm just like,
"we're so [bleep]."

11:34.773 --> 11:37.474
<i>[Applause] Now, again,</i>

11:37.475 --> 11:41.011
there are trends in food,
just like there are in fashion.

11:41.012 --> 11:43.247
<i>So, for the first time ever,</i>

11:43.248 --> 11:45.349
it's fashion night
in Hell's Kitchen.

11:46.551 --> 11:47.618
Wow.

11:47.619 --> 11:48.952
<i>Now, listen carefully.</i>

11:48.953 --> 11:51.188
You'll be creating
a tasting menu

11:51.189 --> 11:53.157
<i>for three fashion designers.</i>

11:53.158 --> 11:54.525
<i>And they'll be judging</i>

11:54.526 --> 11:55.893
your next challenge.

11:55.894 --> 11:57.928
I don't know [bleep]
about fashion.

11:57.929 --> 11:59.296
My wife dresses me.

11:59.297 --> 12:02.065
And I-I think
I look pretty good.

12:02.066 --> 12:03.433
Let's meet our designers.

12:03.434 --> 12:04.802
<i>His clothes are often seen</i>

12:04.803 --> 12:07.004
<i>on the pages of Vogue
and Glamour.</i>

12:07.005 --> 12:08.639
Please welcome David Meister.

12:08.640 --> 12:13.443
[Applause]

12:13.444 --> 12:15.712
<i>Next, we have
a swimwear designer.</i>

12:15.713 --> 12:17.447
<i>Regularly featured
in sports illustrated,</i>

12:17.448 --> 12:20.150
<i>Amanda Che.
[Applause]</i>

12:20.151 --> 12:21.185
<i>And finally,</i>

12:21.186 --> 12:22.586
Ina Soltani.

12:22.587 --> 12:25.923
<i>Her clothes are worn
by celebrities</i>

12:25.924 --> 12:28.292
<i>like Eva Longoria
and Kristen Stewart.</i>

12:28.293 --> 12:30.594
<i>Clemenza, you can put
your tongue back in now.</i>

12:30.595 --> 12:32.996
<i>Honestly, like an antelope.
Okay, listen carefully.</i>

12:32.997 --> 12:35.833
<i>Each team will produce
one stunning appetizer</i>

12:35.834 --> 12:36.834
and two entrees.

12:36.835 --> 12:38.168
<i>One entree is seafood</i>

12:38.169 --> 12:39.670
and another one is poultry.

12:39.671 --> 12:41.305
<i>Got it?
(All) Yes, chef.</i>

12:41.306 --> 12:42.606
<i>David, in terms of a dish,</i>

12:42.607 --> 12:44.074
what do you look for?

12:44.075 --> 12:45.275
I'm looking for
something that's healthy.

12:45.276 --> 12:46.543
<i>Favorite protein:</i>

12:46.544 --> 12:47.945
I love swordfish.

12:47.946 --> 12:49.580
<i>I like spicy food.</i>

12:49.581 --> 12:51.348
So maybe something with
a little bit of spice as well.

12:51.349 --> 12:53.617
<i>Ina...
My whole collection</i>

12:53.618 --> 12:55.319
is inspired by mediterranean.

12:55.320 --> 12:57.888
<i>So I'm looking for something
very colorful,</i>

12:57.889 --> 12:59.323
heavy on seasoning.

12:59.324 --> 13:01.258
(Royce)
Being that I come from Miami,

13:01.259 --> 13:02.960
I've seen all
this fashion stuff.

13:02.961 --> 13:04.528
I know what these people want.
Flavor!

13:04.529 --> 13:08.465
<i>Amanda...
I can't have anything unhealthy.</i>

13:08.466 --> 13:10.200
<i>Or fatty presented
to my guests.</i>

13:10.201 --> 13:12.069
<i>Mm-hmm.
Guys, like, we get it.</i>

13:12.070 --> 13:13.670
You don't like to eat, ever,

13:13.671 --> 13:15.539
and, uh, all you care about
is your image.

13:15.540 --> 13:16.640
Everybody ready?

13:16.641 --> 13:17.841
(All) Yes, chef!

13:17.842 --> 13:18.842
Because your 30 minutes

13:18.843 --> 13:20.844
starts now... let's go!

13:20.845 --> 13:23.547
(Announcer) Both teams must come up
with a three-course tasting menu,

13:23.548 --> 13:26.550
consisting of an appetizer,
one poultry entree,

13:26.551 --> 13:28.418
and one seafood entree,

13:28.419 --> 13:30.787
fit for fashionistas
and their guests.

13:30.788 --> 13:33.357
<i>I think the appetizer
should be lobster medallion.</i>

13:33.358 --> 13:35.192
Yes, he said
he likes swordfish.

13:35.193 --> 13:36.627
He likes swordfish,
so that should be a main.

13:36.628 --> 13:38.395
Okay, let's go.
Right.

13:38.396 --> 13:40.564
(Announcer) The winning
dishes will be on the menu

13:40.565 --> 13:43.200
<i>at the first-ever
Hell's Kitchen fashion night.</i>

13:43.201 --> 13:44.835
You guys are on
the swordfish, right, Royce?

13:44.836 --> 13:46.270
I'm gonna work with Roshni.

13:46.271 --> 13:47.771
I'm thinking, like,
shitake mushrooms.

13:47.772 --> 13:49.172
Okay. All marinated,
but in salad form.

13:49.173 --> 13:50.707
A little warm, but not cooked.

13:50.708 --> 13:52.009
Then the lobster...
lobster medallion,

13:52.010 --> 13:53.110
kind of on top of the lobster?

13:53.111 --> 13:54.478
Exactly,
with a little foam action.

13:54.479 --> 13:56.914
We want to keep it
simple and sweet and sexy.

13:56.915 --> 13:59.750
All of the components are there
for it to be a successful dish.

13:59.751 --> 14:01.685
I love you, lobster.
Good-bye.

14:01.686 --> 14:03.287
(Announcer) As Justin
and Brian work together

14:03.288 --> 14:05.122
to design the blue team's
appetizer,

14:05.123 --> 14:06.690
on the red team, Dana...

14:06.691 --> 14:08.091
Christina, come over here.

14:08.092 --> 14:08.825
(Announcer) Takes over.

14:08.826 --> 14:09.793
Steam the lobster.

14:09.794 --> 14:11.128
Yes, chef.

14:11.129 --> 14:13.764
This is my appetizer.
This represents me.

14:13.765 --> 14:16.733
So I'm making sure
that it's done properly.

14:16.734 --> 14:18.468
Gotta crack this claw,
'cause it...

14:18.469 --> 14:19.603
we're taking out
the claw meat, right?

14:19.604 --> 14:20.904
<i>Um, let's try to...</i>

14:20.905 --> 14:22.139
can we one claw out,
like, nice?

14:22.140 --> 14:23.206
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:23.207 --> 14:24.241
Can you do it or no?

14:24.242 --> 14:25.542
I think I can.

14:25.543 --> 14:27.744
Dana is just
a perfectionist at heart.

14:27.745 --> 14:29.046
I appreciate it,

14:29.047 --> 14:30.647
but just let me do this,
you know?

14:30.648 --> 14:32.115
<i>(Dana) Here, let's put
some of this back,</i>

14:32.116 --> 14:33.383
<i>'cause we just need
a little, little bit.</i>

14:33.384 --> 14:34.918
If Christina messes
something up on the dish,

14:34.919 --> 14:37.020
that's gonna be a reflection
of me too,

14:37.021 --> 14:39.022
because we're working together
as a team.

14:39.023 --> 14:41.024
And I need to prove
to chef Ramsay

14:41.025 --> 14:42.826
why I should be here.

14:42.827 --> 14:45.429
(Announcer) While Dana is
in charge of the appetizer,

14:45.430 --> 14:47.230
in the blue kitchen,
Clemenza...

14:47.231 --> 14:48.732
<i>Yo, wait, wait, wait, wait!</i>

14:48.733 --> 14:50.133
Check this out.
I have an idea.

14:50.134 --> 14:51.134
(Announcer) Collaborates
with Royce and guy

14:51.135 --> 14:52.402
on the fish entree.

14:52.403 --> 14:54.004
The sauce, let me do
like a puttanesca.

14:54.005 --> 14:55.973
<i>Like a traditional puttanesca?</i>

14:55.974 --> 14:57.641
<i>I like that.
Yeah, but I wanna go outside the box</i>

14:57.642 --> 14:58.775
<i>with some clams
and some mussels.</i>

14:58.776 --> 14:59.977
My father has spoon fed me
puttanesca

14:59.978 --> 15:01.645
since I'm a little baby,
so, I mean,

15:01.646 --> 15:03.046
I see the fresh tomatoes.

15:03.047 --> 15:04.715
I see some capers, some olives.

15:04.716 --> 15:06.783
The grilled swordfish.
You know, it's just...

15:06.784 --> 15:08.518
it pops... two seconds.

15:08.519 --> 15:10.487
I had that whole dish composed
in my head in two seconds.

15:10.488 --> 15:11.788
Let's do a little broccolini.

15:11.789 --> 15:13.190
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

15:13.191 --> 15:14.725
Yeah, that'll give us
a nice color on the plate.

15:14.726 --> 15:16.059
For the most part,
Royce is all talk

15:16.060 --> 15:17.394
and smoke and mirrors.

15:17.395 --> 15:19.229
But when he said broccolini,
I'm like,

15:19.230 --> 15:21.031
"wait a minute, that all
[bleep] works perfect.

15:21.032 --> 15:23.567
We just came up with something
without fighting or arguin"

15:23.568 --> 15:25.836
Gotta give it to him.
Royce made a pretty good call.

15:25.837 --> 15:27.270
I got three-color
potatoes.

15:27.271 --> 15:28.839
Broccolini and potatoes, yes.

15:28.840 --> 15:30.640
I'm starting on the potatoes.
I'm putting them up.

15:30.641 --> 15:32.242
Why don't you work on
[bleep] seasoning the fish.

15:32.243 --> 15:34.611
<i>I'll start rockin' out a sauce.</i>

15:34.612 --> 15:38.015
(Announcer) With Clemenza, Royce,
and Guy in sync on their swordfish,

15:38.016 --> 15:40.384
in the red kitchen,
Robyn and Kimmie...

15:40.385 --> 15:41.852
You gonna go swordfish, Robyn?

15:41.853 --> 15:43.453
Swordfish is like a tuna.

15:43.454 --> 15:45.122
And I don't really
like cooking with that.

15:45.123 --> 15:46.423
That's what he said he likes.

15:46.424 --> 15:48.358
(Announcer) Aren't exactly
seeing eye to eye.

15:48.359 --> 15:50.227
(Kimmie) Sometimes I get quiet,
and I just let people,

15:50.228 --> 15:51.495
you know, run all over me.

15:51.496 --> 15:53.163
That's the downfall I have.

15:53.164 --> 15:55.198
I will do the sea bass.

15:55.199 --> 15:57.534
(Announcer) While Robyn dictates
the design of the fish dish,

15:57.535 --> 15:58.869
Tiffany...

15:58.870 --> 16:00.170
All right, what are we
gonna do with the squab?

16:00.171 --> 16:01.538
I don't wanna grill it.

16:01.539 --> 16:02.739
(Announcer)
Is in control of the poultry.

16:02.740 --> 16:03.840
Let's do eggplant.

16:03.841 --> 16:05.275
That's very mediterranean.

16:05.276 --> 16:08.045
Then we'll do
some eggplant fries.

16:08.046 --> 16:09.646
I don't want
to work with Tiffany.

16:09.647 --> 16:10.847
But I'm keeping my mouth shut

16:10.848 --> 16:13.183
because I don't want
to cause any more waves.

16:13.184 --> 16:15.018
Put the wondra in with this.
Okay.

16:15.019 --> 16:17.087
Think fashion, think food,
think trends.

16:17.088 --> 16:19.122
We need to put some kind
of seasoning on there.

16:19.123 --> 16:21.591
Well, I don't know,
I wouldn't...

16:21.592 --> 16:23.460
I usually only season
with salt and pepper.

16:23.461 --> 16:24.594
<i>Let all the natural
flavors come out.</i>

16:24.595 --> 16:26.063
Salt and pepper
is not real spice.

16:26.064 --> 16:28.365
I'm talking cayenne,
smoked paprika.

16:28.366 --> 16:31.001
I mean, the list
goes on and on and on.

16:31.002 --> 16:32.202
<i>Kimmie.
What?</i>

16:32.203 --> 16:34.304
Keep it simple.

16:34.305 --> 16:35.806
Five minutes to window!

16:35.807 --> 16:37.307
(Announcer)
With the clock running down,

16:37.308 --> 16:40.811
the blue team is nervous
about one guy.

16:40.812 --> 16:41.978
Cook, bitches.

16:41.979 --> 16:43.113
How are your potatoes looking?

16:43.114 --> 16:44.281
<i>They're cooking.</i>

16:44.282 --> 16:45.515
<i>Gotta give it
a little bit of time.</i>

16:45.516 --> 16:46.616
But it will work.

16:46.617 --> 16:48.251
Guy is going
to the last minute possible.

16:48.252 --> 16:49.519
So, uh, I'm a little concerned.

16:49.520 --> 16:50.954
Just make sure
they're cooked, baby.

16:50.955 --> 16:52.122
Yeah, of course.

16:52.123 --> 16:53.490
If they're not, take 'em out,

16:53.491 --> 16:54.357
cut 'em down, break 'em down.

16:54.358 --> 16:55.725
Just watch that fish.

16:55.726 --> 16:57.194
I got the fish.
Don't worry about this fish.

16:57.195 --> 16:58.028
One minute, guys!
Let's go.

16:59.263 --> 17:00.597
<i>Where's your potatoes?
Are they ready?</i>

17:00.598 --> 17:01.965
It's coming up.

17:01.966 --> 17:04.300
<i>They need to be ready.
Yeah, I'm gonna make sure.</i>

17:04.301 --> 17:05.769
(Royce) Guy is having a little
trouble with the potatoes.

17:05.770 --> 17:06.770
I think that's ridiculous,
'cause they're, like,

17:06.771 --> 17:08.271
so simple and easy.

17:08.271 --> 17:09.940
<i>(Gordon) 20 seconds to go!</i>

17:09.941 --> 17:11.174
Come on!
You gonna put it on the plate?

17:11.175 --> 17:13.076
<i>On the plate!
Come on, man!</i>

17:13.077 --> 17:14.845
<i>(Gordon)
Five...Four...</i>

17:14.846 --> 17:16.313
<i>Where's your potatoes?
Three...</i>

17:16.314 --> 17:17.646
<i>Are they ready?
Two...</i>

17:17.647 --> 17:18.781
<i>They need to be ready!
One...</i>

17:22.833 --> 17:24.767
(Announcer)
In today's challenge,

17:24.768 --> 17:27.103
the chefs must cook
a three-course tasting menu

17:27.104 --> 17:29.138
<i>for the first-ever
Hell's Kitchen fashion night.</i>

17:29.139 --> 17:30.439
<i>45 seconds!</i>

17:30.440 --> 17:32.508
Bring up the salsa.
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

17:32.509 --> 17:35.011
(Announcer) The read team has
completed all their dishes.

17:35.012 --> 17:36.746
I feel like
it needs to be sweeter.

17:36.747 --> 17:37.980
(Announcer)
But, in the blue kitchen,

17:37.981 --> 17:39.281
Clemenza's swordfish...

17:39.282 --> 17:40.816
<i>Where's your potatoes?
Coming up.</i>

17:40.817 --> 17:42.251
On the plate!
Come on, man!

17:42.252 --> 17:44.754
(Announcer) Is being held up
by Guy's potatoes.

17:44.755 --> 17:46.689
If you got any kind of
[bleep] restaurant experience,

17:46.690 --> 17:48.024
put out a [bleep] thing
of potatoes!

17:48.025 --> 17:49.258
Screw those potatoes.
Let's go.

17:49.259 --> 17:50.426
Let's go!

17:50.427 --> 17:52.028
<i>(Gordon)
Three...Two...</i>

17:52.029 --> 17:53.095
<i>One...</i>

17:53.096 --> 17:54.530
<i>And serve, guys.</i>

17:56.967 --> 17:59.068
Whew, just [bleep]
made it, babe.

17:59.069 --> 18:00.736
(Gordon) Have we created
something cutting edge?

18:00.737 --> 18:01.704
(All) Yes, chef!

18:01.705 --> 18:03.205
Good. Appetizers.

18:03.206 --> 18:05.141
Let's go.

18:05.142 --> 18:08.744
(Brian) Mine and Justin's dish
is damn sexy.

18:08.745 --> 18:11.681
Okay? That is pure
sex on a plate.

18:11.682 --> 18:13.115
Justin, please present
your dish.

18:13.116 --> 18:14.250
We did a seasonal bean salad,

18:14.251 --> 18:16.085
<i>and we put
a little lobster in there.</i>

18:16.086 --> 18:18.320
<i>And there's also a vanilla
and fennel foam right there.</i>

18:18.321 --> 18:20.823
[Laughing] This is not
very visually appealing.

18:20.824 --> 18:22.825
<i>No?
And the foam</i>

18:22.826 --> 18:24.427
<i>is something that I don't think</i>

18:24.428 --> 18:25.895
I can handle.
Not appetizing.

18:25.896 --> 18:27.530
Yeah, it looks like a sort of

18:27.531 --> 18:29.165
<i>regurgitated vomit
on the plate.</i>

18:29.166 --> 18:32.201
I have never done foam
in my life.

18:32.202 --> 18:35.438
I don't like foam.
Never have, never will.

18:35.439 --> 18:37.273
It needs to be intriguing
to the eye

18:37.274 --> 18:38.674
and to the person
to want to taste it.

18:38.675 --> 18:39.508
<i>And it's really not.</i>

18:39.509 --> 18:41.077
It's all over the place.

18:41.078 --> 18:43.212
I don't understand what
the big deal is about foam.

18:43.213 --> 18:45.247
I mean, I... have they
ever been to dinner before?

18:45.248 --> 18:46.615
<i>It's not, like,
one unified thought,</i>

18:46.616 --> 18:48.217
like a design.

18:48.218 --> 18:49.919
<i>And I don't think it looks
elegant or sophisticated.</i>

18:49.920 --> 18:51.087
It just looks ordinary.

18:51.088 --> 18:52.388
<i>It's a lot of food</i>

18:52.389 --> 18:53.723
for an appetizer, I feel.

18:53.724 --> 18:55.057
Let's dig in.

18:55.058 --> 18:57.426
<i>It may taste
better than it looks.</i>

18:57.427 --> 18:58.961
<i>I think the foam</i>

18:58.962 --> 19:01.263
is a little sweet.

19:01.264 --> 19:03.265
Was it supposed to be
that sweet?

19:03.266 --> 19:05.101
We wanted to bring out
the sweetness of the lobster,

19:05.102 --> 19:07.069
<i>and then cut it with
the acid of the bean salad.</i>

19:07.070 --> 19:08.904
<i>(Amanda) I feel like
this is a little bland.</i>

19:08.905 --> 19:10.639
<i>There's no kick,
there's no spice.</i>

19:10.640 --> 19:11.974
There's nothing special
going on.

19:11.975 --> 19:13.943
<i>I emphasized spices,</i>

19:13.944 --> 19:16.245
<i>and I emphasized zest.
Yes.</i>

19:16.246 --> 19:18.814
And I'm not getting
the "wow" from this.

19:19.983 --> 19:21.617
(Kimmie) This is not good.

19:21.618 --> 19:23.753
These judges
are some hardcore judges.

19:23.754 --> 19:25.621
I'm scared for
the red team at this point.

19:25.622 --> 19:27.356
All right, Dana,
what is that, please?

19:27.357 --> 19:29.859
Here we have
a chilled mango broth.

19:29.860 --> 19:31.393
<i>And jumbo lump crab meat.</i>

19:31.394 --> 19:32.762
Visually, it's a little clumsy.

19:32.763 --> 19:34.263
<i>(Gordon)
Mm-hmm.</i>

19:34.264 --> 19:35.831
I was expecting something
a little more chic,

19:35.832 --> 19:37.166
sleek, elegant.

19:37.167 --> 19:39.168
It's not really
the most appealing color.

19:39.169 --> 19:42.104
The, uh, the mango wasn't
quite as ripe as we'd hoped.

19:42.105 --> 19:43.606
<i>There's no fat in there,</i>

19:43.607 --> 19:45.708
<i>except for a tiny bit
of olive oil.</i>

19:45.709 --> 19:46.976
<i>The taste is interesting.</i>

19:46.977 --> 19:48.277
<i>You do get that little</i>

19:48.278 --> 19:49.912
after-hint of spice,
which I think is nice.

19:49.913 --> 19:51.914
Thank you.

19:51.915 --> 19:53.482
David, red or blue, please.

19:53.483 --> 19:54.750
Um, red.

19:55.852 --> 19:56.852
Amanda, red or blue, please.

19:57.888 --> 19:59.421
I'd have to agree on red.

19:59.422 --> 20:00.623
<i>Ina, red or blue, please?
Thank you.</i>

20:00.624 --> 20:02.658
Red.
Wow, congratulations.

20:02.659 --> 20:06.128
I don't care what the hell
those three [bleep] say.

20:06.129 --> 20:08.097
It was a nice dish.
It was a very nice dish.

20:08.098 --> 20:09.598
Dana, well thought out.

20:09.599 --> 20:10.833
<i>Thank you, chef.
Really well thought out.</i>

20:10.834 --> 20:12.001
Uh-huh, that's what's up.

20:12.002 --> 20:13.068
Okay, next course.

20:13.069 --> 20:14.103
<i>Poultry, let's go.</i>

20:14.104 --> 20:16.272
<i>Domes off, please.</i>

20:16.273 --> 20:17.940
(Patrick)
I love mine and Roshni's dish.

20:17.941 --> 20:19.308
My plan is to...
is to wow them.

20:19.309 --> 20:20.976
So this afternoon
we've prepared for you

20:20.977 --> 20:23.279
a Moroccan spice
influenced squab.

20:23.280 --> 20:25.247
<i>There's a touch of vinegar
in there as well.</i>

20:25.248 --> 20:26.482
I believe vinegar helps
to thin the mucous.

20:26.483 --> 20:27.616
[Needle scratches on record]

20:27.617 --> 20:28.851
Thin the what?

20:28.852 --> 20:31.787
(Brian)
Oh, my God...Patrick...

20:31.788 --> 20:34.056
It thins the mucous?

20:34.057 --> 20:36.625
<i>(Gordon) I've never heard mucous
in the description of food.</i>

20:36.626 --> 20:38.627
We're trying to turn them on,
not turn them off.

20:38.628 --> 20:41.096
Agh, that was the dumbest thing
I've ever said.

20:41.097 --> 20:43.199
[Gunshot sound effect]

20:43.200 --> 20:45.034
I love vinegar... I put
a touch of vinegar in anything.

20:45.035 --> 20:46.101
Sorry for that one.

20:46.102 --> 20:47.403
I think, with the sauce,

20:47.404 --> 20:48.838
<i>if you're gonna do a sauce,</i>

20:48.839 --> 20:50.239
it can't be,
like, blob-like,

20:50.240 --> 20:52.308
<i>'cause that, to me,
says non-sophistication.</i>

20:52.309 --> 20:54.310
<i>(Gordon) Let's dig in.</i>

20:54.311 --> 20:56.779
How does it taste?
Hmm...

20:56.780 --> 20:58.347
It's interesting.
It's interesting,

20:58.348 --> 20:59.882
but there's no kick in it.

20:59.883 --> 21:01.450
<i>(Amanda) I love kale.</i>

21:01.451 --> 21:03.118
So that's huge for me.

21:03.119 --> 21:04.553
<i>I mean, it's a heavy portion.</i>

21:04.554 --> 21:05.788
It's weighted,

21:05.789 --> 21:07.323
<i>which I think is clumsily...</i>

21:07.324 --> 21:08.390
who worked on
this dish with you?

21:08.391 --> 21:10.359
Uh, Roshni.

21:10.360 --> 21:12.528
I like it.
I don't love it.

21:14.631 --> 21:16.665
Clearly, I'm not
that fashionable.

21:16.666 --> 21:18.667
But listening to their comments
will make me

21:18.668 --> 21:22.037
look at a plate
differently from now on.

21:22.038 --> 21:23.439
Tiffany, explain
the dish, thank you.

21:23.440 --> 21:24.473
What I have here is

21:24.474 --> 21:26.008
<i>a pan-roasted squab.</i>

21:26.009 --> 21:27.643
<i>There is eggplant pureed.</i>

21:27.644 --> 21:29.345
Um, I have an eggplant fry.

21:30.814 --> 21:32.381
<i>Fried?
Yes.</i>

21:32.382 --> 21:33.382
Deep fat fried?

21:33.383 --> 21:35.384
Uh, yes.

21:35.385 --> 21:37.219
Fried food
is a big no-no.

21:38.788 --> 21:40.823
Fried? Fr-fr... like...

21:40.824 --> 21:42.758
Tiffany, were you
in the bathroom

21:42.759 --> 21:44.126
when they were explaining
that they wanted everything

21:44.127 --> 21:45.561
to be super-healthy?

21:45.562 --> 21:47.730
Because, you know,
healthy and deep fried

21:47.731 --> 21:49.431
don't really go together.

21:49.432 --> 21:51.533
Well, here's the thing
with fried eggplant with me.

21:51.534 --> 21:53.168
I'm a big dude,
and I'm Italian.

21:53.169 --> 21:55.204
Fried, great.
Eggplant, even better.

21:55.205 --> 21:57.039
But is it the right thing to do

21:57.040 --> 21:59.308
for some pretentious
fashion people? No.

21:59.309 --> 22:01.944
I don't think this
looks really, again,

22:01.945 --> 22:03.078
<i>chic or clean</i>

22:03.079 --> 22:04.613
or sophisticated or modern.

22:04.614 --> 22:05.881
No, I don't think
the fashion crowd

22:05.882 --> 22:06.682
are coming with bibs.

22:06.683 --> 22:07.516
Exactly!
No. No.

22:08.585 --> 22:09.885
Jump in, please.

22:09.886 --> 22:12.054
Watch out
for the fried eggplant.

22:12.055 --> 22:13.055
That is delicious.

22:14.824 --> 22:16.492
The pomegranate salad
is actually...

22:16.493 --> 22:17.826
<i>Nice.
Thank you.</i>

22:17.827 --> 22:18.694
This is too much, too greasy.

22:19.963 --> 22:22.331
Whose idea was it
to do fried eggplant?

22:22.332 --> 22:23.699
That was me, chef.

22:23.700 --> 22:25.334
Do you want to eat
a fried eggplant,

22:25.335 --> 22:26.602
<i>and then jump into
a, you know, a swimsuit?</i>

22:26.603 --> 22:27.703
Uh, no, chef.
No, no. Come on.

22:29.005 --> 22:30.105
We [bleep] up.

22:30.106 --> 22:31.974
Deep fat fried and models...

22:31.975 --> 22:33.442
Don't mix.

22:33.443 --> 22:34.810
But I know now.

22:34.811 --> 22:36.345
<i>If you had to choose</i>

22:36.346 --> 22:37.880
between the red team
and the blue team,

22:37.881 --> 22:38.981
David, red or blue, please.

22:41.418 --> 22:42.851
Blue.

22:42.852 --> 22:43.852
Blue, thank you.
Amanda.

22:44.854 --> 22:46.055
Blue as well.

22:46.056 --> 22:47.222
<i>Ina, red or blue, please.</i>

22:47.223 --> 22:48.257
Blue it is.

22:48.258 --> 22:49.558
All right, blue it is.

22:49.559 --> 22:50.693
Good job.
We got a tie.

22:50.694 --> 22:52.161
(Clemenza)
I'm psyched right now.

22:52.162 --> 22:53.829
We got a shot
to actually win this.

22:53.830 --> 22:55.531
Blue team's pumped right now.
We're ready to go, man.

22:55.532 --> 22:57.132
(Announcer)
With the score tied...

22:57.133 --> 22:58.534
Seafood, let's go.

22:58.535 --> 23:00.002
(Announcer)
It all comes down to guy,

23:00.003 --> 23:01.870
Clemenza, and Royce's swordfish

23:01.871 --> 23:04.306
versus Robyn and Kimmie's
sea bass.

23:04.307 --> 23:06.375
(Kimmie)
I'm not sure about this dish.

23:06.376 --> 23:08.711
The judges wanted spice,
and she didn't listen to me.

23:08.712 --> 23:10.980
Domes off.

23:10.981 --> 23:12.181
<i>Wow. Guy...</i>

23:12.182 --> 23:13.782
Present the dish.
Thank you.

23:13.783 --> 23:14.683
We have, uh,
swordfish puttanesca,

23:14.684 --> 23:15.751
<i>seasoned with chili,</i>

23:15.752 --> 23:17.720
paprika, and saffron.

23:17.721 --> 23:19.154
<i>What we wanted to do is bring</i>

23:19.155 --> 23:20.389
the spiciness of Spain

23:20.390 --> 23:22.091
<i>and Italy.</i>

23:22.092 --> 23:23.625
I know this is two countries

23:23.626 --> 23:25.260
that produce a lot of fashion.

23:25.261 --> 23:28.097
I have a very personal
connection with Italy

23:28.098 --> 23:29.765
<i>and Spain.</i>

23:29.766 --> 23:31.233
(Guy) Ina gave me the eyes.

23:31.234 --> 23:33.035
[Chuckles]

23:33.036 --> 23:35.304
As soon as I see
that connection,

23:35.305 --> 23:38.440
"oh, Italy is my favorite.
Ah, ah, ah!"

23:38.441 --> 23:40.509
Yeah, okay. Okay.

23:40.510 --> 23:42.478
I know what's your favorite.
You're not fooling me.

23:42.479 --> 23:44.480
I'm going to surrender
to this one.

23:44.481 --> 23:46.915
It's not new to me.

23:46.916 --> 23:50.853
Most women surrender.

23:50.854 --> 23:52.688
Well, I really do
love the mussels and clams,

23:52.689 --> 23:54.256
<i>being a swimwear designer.</i>

23:54.257 --> 23:55.624
<i>I think that will</i>

23:55.625 --> 23:58.027
resonate with
a lot of our guests.

23:58.028 --> 23:59.528
Please dig in.

24:02.165 --> 24:03.365
Mmm, delicious.
Mmm.

24:03.366 --> 24:04.867
Thank you.
Thank you.

24:04.868 --> 24:06.735
I think you just need
to really refine

24:06.736 --> 24:08.637
and simplify and edit
that presentation.

24:10.507 --> 24:11.874
<i>And the sauce on the bottom,</i>

24:11.875 --> 24:13.308
I would leave that out.

24:13.309 --> 24:15.477
It doesn't sound like
they love it.

24:15.478 --> 24:17.980
But all that matters
is my girl Ina.

24:20.417 --> 24:22.584
<i>Next. Robyn, present
the dish, thank you.</i>

24:22.585 --> 24:24.286
We did a seared sea bass

24:24.287 --> 24:26.188
<i>with, uh, grapes, sprouts,</i>

24:26.189 --> 24:28.023
<i>as well as micro basil.</i>

24:28.024 --> 24:29.425
I'm drawn to it

24:29.426 --> 24:31.894
because of the pink and green
at the bottom.

24:31.895 --> 24:34.496
It just needs to be
sharper and more precise.

24:34.497 --> 24:36.532
Thank you.
Dig in, please.

24:36.533 --> 24:38.000
I do think the grape
is interesting.

24:38.001 --> 24:39.201
<i>I like that.
Mm-hmm.</i>

24:39.202 --> 24:40.002
<i>But the vinegar
is overwhelming.</i>

24:40.003 --> 24:42.037
Quite bland.

24:42.038 --> 24:43.138
What about the spices?
Right.

24:44.841 --> 24:46.842
<i>What about zesty?
What about pungent?</i>

24:46.843 --> 24:48.844
What about...Kick?

24:48.845 --> 24:51.313
Who the [bleep] do you
think you are?

24:51.314 --> 24:53.582
You ladies come back here
and try to cook

24:53.583 --> 24:56.118
in your damn stiletto heels.

24:56.119 --> 24:57.586
So if you have to choose?

24:58.955 --> 25:00.622
Blue!

25:00.623 --> 25:01.623
Yeah.

25:01.624 --> 25:03.725
Amanda, red or blue, please.

25:04.961 --> 25:07.129
<i>Red.
Wow.</i>

25:07.130 --> 25:08.697
David, red or blue, please.

25:14.936 --> 25:17.671
(Announcer) The chefs have been
challenged to come up with a tasting menu

25:17.672 --> 25:19.806
<i>for the first-ever
Hell's Kitchen fashion night.</i>

25:19.807 --> 25:21.641
<i>So if you have to choose...
Blue!</i>

25:21.642 --> 25:22.809
<i>Amanda, red or blue, please?</i>

25:22.810 --> 25:24.077
<i>Red.
Wow.</i>

25:24.078 --> 25:25.912
(Announcer)
With the score tied,

25:25.913 --> 25:28.081
it all comes down
to the final judge's vote.

25:28.082 --> 25:30.283
It's the men's
swordfish puttanesca

25:30.284 --> 25:32.185
versus the women's sea bass.

25:32.186 --> 25:33.353
David, red or blue, please.

25:36.591 --> 25:37.824
Blue all the way.

25:37.825 --> 25:40.460
<i>[Applause] Yes!</i>

25:40.461 --> 25:42.062
Great job.

25:42.063 --> 25:43.930
<i>Wow, Robyn.</i>

25:43.931 --> 25:45.699
We asked for something spicy.

25:45.700 --> 25:48.034
I told her three times.

25:48.035 --> 25:50.337
"We need to add spice.
We need to add spice.

25:50.338 --> 25:52.205
We need to add spice."

25:52.206 --> 25:54.508
And it was like
she didn't want to listen.

25:54.509 --> 25:55.776
<i>I'm sure.</i>

25:55.777 --> 25:57.210
You're all gonna join me

25:57.211 --> 25:58.211
in thanking
our esteemed judges.

25:58.212 --> 25:59.913
<i>[Applause] Thank you.</i>

25:59.914 --> 26:01.081
I [bleep] hate 'em.

26:01.082 --> 26:02.482
I hate 'em all.

26:02.483 --> 26:03.517
All of 'em.

26:03.518 --> 26:05.652
Best wishes.

26:10.625 --> 26:12.893
(Robyn) Kimmie is definitely
taking it hard, you know,

26:12.894 --> 26:14.661
and I feel like
she's blaming it on me, like...

26:14.662 --> 26:16.596
If she wanted to use a little
bit more bold flavors,

26:16.597 --> 26:18.732
then she should have
spoke up a little bit more.

26:20.234 --> 26:21.268
<i>Blue team...</i>

26:21.269 --> 26:22.269
Congratulations.

26:22.270 --> 26:23.904
[Cheers and applause]

26:23.905 --> 26:26.072
You're in for a great day,
let me tell you that.

26:26.073 --> 26:28.041
I've got a couple of grand

26:28.042 --> 26:30.143
for you to spend in a boutique
in Malibu!

26:30.144 --> 26:31.745
[Men cheering]

26:31.746 --> 26:35.081
Feels great to be a winner!
Whoo hoo!

26:35.082 --> 26:36.316
<i>You're all gonna get</i>

26:36.317 --> 26:37.317
amazing new outfits.

26:37.318 --> 26:38.785
<i>Ooh.
Then...</i>

26:38.786 --> 26:40.554
<i>You will spend
the rest of the afternoon</i>

26:40.555 --> 26:43.557
wine tasting in the beautiful
hills of Malibu.

26:43.558 --> 26:45.292
Thank you, chef.

26:45.293 --> 26:48.094
Are you [bleep] kidding me?

26:48.095 --> 26:50.030
I wanted that!
[Bleep] damn it.

26:50.031 --> 26:51.565
<i>Get upstairs, get changed.</i>

26:51.566 --> 26:52.899
<i>Malibu awaits.
Thank you, chef!</i>

26:52.900 --> 26:54.100
<i>Are you all right?</i>

26:54.101 --> 26:55.669
Crying tears of joy?
Yeah.

26:55.670 --> 26:57.204
I'm so happy.
I'm really, really happy.

26:57.205 --> 26:58.605
Blue team needed this.

26:58.606 --> 27:00.040
We really needed this.

27:00.041 --> 27:02.509
Kimmie and Robyn,
you heard them. Spice!

27:02.510 --> 27:05.445
I said spice.
She didn't want to use it.

27:05.446 --> 27:07.480
<i>(Gordon) You need to put
your own input on there.</i>

27:07.481 --> 27:08.815
Don't get bullied by Robyn.

27:08.816 --> 27:11.051
<i>Trust your instincts.</i>

27:11.052 --> 27:12.919
When you believe in something,
that you want it spicy,

27:12.920 --> 27:15.388
<i>take the risk.</i>

27:15.389 --> 27:16.756
I'm pissed off.

27:16.757 --> 27:18.625
And I really don't want
to talk right now.

27:18.626 --> 27:20.760
Like, for real... I do not want
to speak to anybody.

27:22.029 --> 27:23.396
<i>Ladies, unfortunately,</i>

27:23.397 --> 27:24.564
you have a lot
of work to do today.

27:24.565 --> 27:25.699
<i>First of all,</i>

27:25.700 --> 27:27.667
<i>you'll be transforming
this entire</i>

27:27.668 --> 27:30.503
<i>restaurant into something
chic and stunning</i>

27:30.504 --> 27:32.539
ahead of our first-ever
fashion night.

27:32.540 --> 27:34.307
<i>You'll be hand-building</i>

27:34.308 --> 27:36.109
a runway.

27:36.110 --> 27:37.777
<i>Making centerpieces.</i>

27:37.778 --> 27:39.479
You're gonna be
under the guidance of

27:39.480 --> 27:40.780
<i>a top fashion producer.</i>

27:40.781 --> 27:42.215
<i>She'll be arriving shortly.</i>

27:42.216 --> 27:43.717
Let's go.

27:43.718 --> 27:45.385
(Robyn) Punishment sucks.

27:45.386 --> 27:47.120
I'm tired of [bleep] going out
like a loser.

27:47.121 --> 27:49.289
<i>[Humming] Yeah!</i>

27:49.290 --> 27:51.625
(Tiffany) Have a wonderful
time shopping, bitch.

27:51.626 --> 27:52.626
'Scuse me!
'Scuse me!

27:52.627 --> 27:53.927
'Scuse me!

27:53.928 --> 27:55.495
'Scuse me!
[Bleep].

27:55.496 --> 27:57.264
We're just going on a shopping
spree into Malibu.

27:57.265 --> 27:59.099
Have fun being girls.

27:59.100 --> 28:01.368
Life is good on
the blue team right now,

28:01.369 --> 28:03.069
and not so much
on the red team.

28:03.070 --> 28:05.538
They get to spend
thousands of dollars

28:05.539 --> 28:07.707
on clothes that
they probably don't need.

28:07.708 --> 28:09.142
I need new clothes!

28:09.143 --> 28:11.177
[Whimpers]
Oh, I wanna go shopping!

28:11.178 --> 28:13.747
<i>Let's go, baby.
Buon giorno!</i>

28:19.820 --> 28:20.921
No, this is it, right here.

28:20.922 --> 28:22.722
<i>This is it.</i>

28:22.723 --> 28:24.391
<i>Welcome, hi.
Elena.</i>

28:24.392 --> 28:26.660
Gonna be your
personal shopper today.

28:26.661 --> 28:28.295
Congratulations on a win.

28:28.296 --> 28:30.163
Oh, my God, dress me forever.

28:30.164 --> 28:31.865
Okay!
Please.

28:31.866 --> 28:33.233
My heart skipped a beat.

28:33.234 --> 28:34.868
She's attractive.

28:34.869 --> 28:36.870
So we're gonna
get you guys dressed.

28:36.871 --> 28:39.873
Very, very, very attractive.

28:39.874 --> 28:41.541
Let me have that one.
Okay.

28:41.542 --> 28:43.109
I already saw it.
You wanna go with that?

28:43.110 --> 28:44.377
I like having
a personal shopper.

28:44.378 --> 28:45.745
This shirt's badass.
I like that one.

28:45.746 --> 28:47.314
I love shopping
to begin with, for myself,

28:47.315 --> 28:48.915
but when it's not my money,
it's even better.

28:48.916 --> 28:50.550
<i>Hey, Elena... Do you like
what's happened here?</i>

28:50.551 --> 28:52.185
I love what's happening
right now.

28:52.186 --> 28:53.954
You enjoy
what's happening here?

28:53.955 --> 28:55.288
Yeah.

28:55.289 --> 28:57.057
I know there's
something special between us.

28:57.058 --> 28:58.358
I know there's
something special.

28:58.359 --> 28:59.893
To match your eyes.

29:02.830 --> 29:04.464
You like that?

29:04.465 --> 29:07.467
[Phony accent] You don't find
me sexy in my tight clothes?

29:07.468 --> 29:09.169
Look at you.

29:09.170 --> 29:10.170
<i>Damn!
Damn!</i>

29:10.171 --> 29:11.571
Hey.

29:11.572 --> 29:13.506
Oh, my God, I'm wearing
$800 worth

29:13.507 --> 29:14.541
of product on my body.

29:14.542 --> 29:16.242
I feel like royalty.

29:16.243 --> 29:17.544
I broke out of my shell.

29:17.545 --> 29:19.312
<i>Come on out!
Nice job.</i>

29:19.313 --> 29:21.047
(Announcer)
While the blue team sets off

29:21.048 --> 29:22.282
on part two of their reward...

29:22.283 --> 29:24.751
The red team faces
a day of hard work.

29:24.752 --> 29:26.586
Let's hustle, hustle, hustle!

29:26.587 --> 29:28.421
(Announcer) Supervised
by the event planner

29:28.422 --> 29:30.056
<i>for the Hell's Kitchen
fashion show.</i>

29:30.057 --> 29:31.524
We're under a time constraint.

29:31.525 --> 29:33.326
I know that a good amount
of my teammates

29:33.327 --> 29:35.195
aren't really down
for the physical labor.

29:35.196 --> 29:36.529
Could you help me?

29:36.530 --> 29:38.198
When I see the pieces
of the runway

29:38.199 --> 29:39.532
that we have to move in,

29:39.533 --> 29:41.101
my heart just kind of drops.

29:41.102 --> 29:42.936
I'm gonna be doing a good amount
of the brunt work.

29:42.937 --> 29:44.838
Stand it, carry it from the...

29:44.839 --> 29:46.406
Christi... carry it from the bottom.
I got it.

29:46.407 --> 29:48.108
Lifting one of these things

29:48.109 --> 29:51.044
is like carrying Clemenza
up the [bleep] stairs.

29:51.045 --> 29:53.113
So, like, I'm already starting
to feel it in my back.

29:53.114 --> 29:54.381
On to the next piece.

29:54.382 --> 29:55.949
We have to hustle.

29:55.950 --> 29:58.518
Could two of the people
do something else with you?

29:58.519 --> 30:00.487
Somebody can do the wrenches,

30:00.488 --> 30:01.788
<i>and the rest of you can
go out and get the platform.</i>

30:01.789 --> 30:03.323
Okay.

30:03.324 --> 30:05.291
Instead of doing
one task at a time,

30:05.292 --> 30:06.793
we can multiple-task.
You know what I'm saying?

30:06.794 --> 30:07.727
Kimmie, let's sit here
and tie [bleep] together.

30:07.728 --> 30:09.129
<i>[Bleep], look at this.</i>

30:09.130 --> 30:10.397
Let's take the four
smallest people

30:10.398 --> 30:11.631
out to get the next piece.

30:11.632 --> 30:14.000
Robyn volunteers
to stay back and

30:14.001 --> 30:16.469
screw in the runway.

30:16.470 --> 30:17.670
Who's with me?

30:17.671 --> 30:18.805
Oh, [bleep].
No way.

30:18.806 --> 30:20.473
I'm gonna go help them.

30:22.543 --> 30:24.077
You ready?
One, two...

30:24.078 --> 30:26.212
Four, now.
Okay.

30:26.213 --> 30:27.781
Um...

30:27.782 --> 30:29.049
Nope.

30:29.050 --> 30:30.950
My forearm
is [bleep] killin' me.

30:30.951 --> 30:33.686
<i>Ladies, let's put a move on!</i>

30:33.687 --> 30:35.655
<i>Christina...
Yes?</i>

30:35.656 --> 30:37.190
<i>We don't know where
this t-wrench is connect...</i>

30:37.191 --> 30:38.391
<i>how to connect it.</i>

30:38.392 --> 30:39.826
Christina...

30:39.827 --> 30:42.328
<i>Help me, where a t-wrench
might go in a...</i>

30:42.329 --> 30:44.764
turn it, because...

30:44.765 --> 30:46.332
Oh, crap.

30:46.333 --> 30:48.835
(Barbie) Robyn is apparently
a Jack of all trades,

30:48.836 --> 30:50.804
but a master of none.

30:50.805 --> 30:52.472
Way to be a team player, Robyn.

30:52.473 --> 30:53.873
You selfish bitch.

30:53.874 --> 30:55.208
There we go.

30:55.209 --> 30:57.077
You wanna play screwdriver?

30:57.078 --> 30:58.378
Have fun at it.

30:58.379 --> 30:59.779
I don't have time
for this [bleep].

31:01.549 --> 31:04.417
Oh, everybody was so excited
to put the stage together.

31:04.418 --> 31:05.919
It's fun, isn't it?

31:05.920 --> 31:07.954
Dude, are you [bleep] serious?
Come on, man.

31:07.955 --> 31:09.322
Help me out.

31:09.323 --> 31:11.825
(Dana) Christina is
scary when she's mad.

31:11.826 --> 31:14.360
She needs to just relax.

31:14.361 --> 31:16.196
Ohh! [bleep] you all right?

31:16.197 --> 31:17.864
I just [bleep]
smacked my tooth.

31:17.865 --> 31:20.033
I'm sweating all the way
down my back,

31:20.034 --> 31:23.002
like, it's pouring off my face,
and I'm getting frustrated.

31:23.003 --> 31:25.171
I'm just realizing
this is gonna take forever.

31:25.172 --> 31:26.906
Carry it like this.

31:26.907 --> 31:28.842
Whoa, you gotta let me know
when you're doing that, dude.

31:28.843 --> 31:30.777
<i>Let's get the next one in.</i>

31:30.778 --> 31:32.078
Keep it moving.

31:32.079 --> 31:33.947
I'm losing it.

31:33.948 --> 31:35.548
This is getting to be
really ridiculous.

31:35.549 --> 31:36.916
All right, Christina.

31:36.917 --> 31:39.385
[Bleep] Get somebody else
to hold it.

31:39.386 --> 31:41.087
<i>Christina...
Where are you going?</i>

31:46.147 --> 31:48.616
(Announcer) After losing the
tasting menu challenge,

31:48.617 --> 31:51.085
the red team must transform
the dining room

31:51.086 --> 31:53.053
<i>for the first-ever
Hell's Kitchen fashion night.</i>

31:53.054 --> 31:54.622
Carry it like this.

31:54.623 --> 31:56.423
(Announcer) But after
two hours of pushing

31:56.424 --> 31:58.392
and motivating her teammates...

31:58.393 --> 32:00.127
[Bleep] that.
Somebody else hold it.

32:00.128 --> 32:01.629
(Announcer)
Christina has had enough.

32:01.630 --> 32:03.697
<i>Let's get the next one in.</i>

32:03.698 --> 32:05.466
Keep it moving.
Let's connect it.

32:05.467 --> 32:08.035
(Dana)
Christina is kind of pissed off.

32:08.036 --> 32:09.737
And I need her to stay strong.

32:09.738 --> 32:13.007
So I think we all need
to blow off some steam.

32:13.008 --> 32:15.342
[All cheering]

32:15.343 --> 32:16.777
<i>Go ahead and do a stare!</i>

32:16.778 --> 32:19.380
All right!
Let's see it!

32:19.381 --> 32:20.948
[All cheering]

32:20.949 --> 32:22.483
<i>It, go.
Come on, Kimmie.</i>

32:22.484 --> 32:23.784
Work, work, work!
Come on, girl!

32:23.785 --> 32:25.853
<i>Go do a good stare!
Do the stare!</i>

32:25.854 --> 32:28.789
[Cheers and applause]

32:28.790 --> 32:30.324
Ohh! All right!

32:30.325 --> 32:32.393
Oh, my God.
[Laughs]

32:32.394 --> 32:34.394
Just seeing this,
it's hard to be upset.

32:35.030 --> 32:36.563
<i>This is about as close
to fashion</i>

32:36.564 --> 32:38.599
<i>as you guys are gonna get.</i>

32:38.600 --> 32:40.801
(Announcer) While the women are
miles away from the high life,

32:40.802 --> 32:43.237
the blue team enjoys
a taste of luxury...

32:43.238 --> 32:45.272
<i>(Man) Hi, everybody.
Come on in.</i>

32:45.273 --> 32:47.041
(Announcer) At Rosenthal Estate
in Malibu.

32:47.042 --> 32:49.076
Fantastic.
This is perfect.

32:49.077 --> 32:51.679
(Clemenza) We got bottles of
wine and these platters of food.

32:51.680 --> 32:53.347
This waiter's at
our beck and call.

32:53.348 --> 32:55.182
It doesn't get
much better than that.

32:55.183 --> 32:57.117
We're pouring three wines
for you right now.

32:57.118 --> 32:59.320
You know, I lived
in Napa for a little bit.

32:59.321 --> 33:01.822
Mm-hmm. That's some great
bright notes right upfront.

33:01.823 --> 33:03.190
<i>Right on the palate.</i>

33:03.191 --> 33:04.892
You've got touch
of a green apple.

33:04.893 --> 33:06.460
Good minerality.

33:06.461 --> 33:08.562
Decent amount of pineapple,
but not over the top.

33:08.563 --> 33:11.131
Love the touch of acidity
on my finish here.

33:11.132 --> 33:12.800
Patrick is a know-it-all.

33:12.801 --> 33:14.468
<i>(Patrick) You don't
find any 100%-ers.</i>

33:14.469 --> 33:16.236
<i>It's always 85% and under.</i>

33:16.237 --> 33:18.005
What is he talking about
right now?

33:18.006 --> 33:19.573
We're just trying
to enjoy ourselves.

33:19.574 --> 33:21.175
It's just wine, bro.

33:21.176 --> 33:23.110
<i>Thank you, Neil.
Guys.</i>

33:23.111 --> 33:24.278
[Ding]

33:24.279 --> 33:25.279
[Ding]

33:25.280 --> 33:26.280
[Ding]

33:26.281 --> 33:27.281
[Ding]

33:27.282 --> 33:28.282
[Ding]

33:28.283 --> 33:29.283
[Ding]

33:29.284 --> 33:30.284
[Ding]

33:30.285 --> 33:31.719
[Ding]

33:31.720 --> 33:33.354
Whee! This is fun.

33:33.355 --> 33:35.289
This is fun.
Let me have that cheese.

33:35.290 --> 33:37.491
Let me have that prosciutto.

33:37.492 --> 33:39.593
I'm half-baked.
[Laughs]

33:39.594 --> 33:42.162
Everything that you could
possibly think of was beautiful.

33:42.163 --> 33:43.697
It felt really, really nice

33:43.698 --> 33:45.566
to be out of the kitchen
for one day.

33:45.567 --> 33:47.701
Since we've been nothing
but losing, I'm full of love.

33:47.702 --> 33:49.570
Here's a genuine hug from me

33:49.571 --> 33:50.637
to the entire world.

33:50.638 --> 33:51.638
I'm hugging you.

33:51.639 --> 33:52.973
<i>Cheers.
Salud.</i>

33:52.974 --> 33:53.974
<i>Salud.</i>

33:53.975 --> 33:55.142
[Glasses clinking]

33:55.143 --> 33:56.510
[Flatulence] Ahh.

33:57.812 --> 33:59.146
<i>I just totally ripped ass.</i>

33:59.147 --> 34:00.914
I've got some gas today.

34:00.915 --> 34:02.082
<i>Dude!
[Laughs]</i>

34:02.083 --> 34:06.286
How [bleep] gross is that?

34:06.287 --> 34:07.321
[Belches]

34:07.322 --> 34:08.355
See, I'm burping.

34:08.356 --> 34:09.857
[Raspberries]

34:09.858 --> 34:12.893
[Laughter]

34:12.893 --> 34:14.495
Tiffany is [bleep] disgusting.

34:14.496 --> 34:16.330
[Bleep] reeks over here.

34:16.331 --> 34:17.965
[Laughter]

34:19.100 --> 34:20.501
<i>She's farting over here.</i>

34:20.502 --> 34:21.802
[Laughter]

34:21.803 --> 34:23.270
Savages.

34:23.271 --> 34:25.472
Somebody's gonna
love me for who I am.

34:26.940 --> 34:28.475
<i>Give me a catwalk!</i>

34:28.476 --> 34:29.976
<i>Let's go, a catwalk!</i>

34:31.279 --> 34:32.379
Hi, guys.

34:32.380 --> 34:34.047
[Overlapping chatter]

34:34.049 --> 34:36.516
I'm three feet too short
to be a model,

34:36.518 --> 34:37.518
and I walk the runway.

34:37.518 --> 34:39.620
I'm on cloud 9,

34:39.621 --> 34:41.487
I'm on cloud 10,
I'm on cloud 11.

34:41.489 --> 34:43.190
I mean, I felt like
an Indian princess today.

34:43.190 --> 34:44.525
Rosh!
I'm coming!

34:44.525 --> 34:46.159
This day really [bleep] sucks.

34:46.161 --> 34:47.995
Like, I really wish
we would have won.

34:49.864 --> 34:51.364
I'm still [bleep] pissed.

34:51.366 --> 34:52.533
I don't even want
to look at Robyn,

34:52.534 --> 34:54.001
because she makes me sick.

34:54.002 --> 34:55.569
So I'm trying to put
this nasty bitch

34:55.570 --> 34:57.404
in the back of my head.

34:57.405 --> 34:59.640
<i>I'm annoyed that she
blamed it all on me.</i>

34:59.641 --> 35:02.109
(Robyn) Kimmie got pissed off,
and she told chef Ramsay

35:02.110 --> 35:03.811
I said no to everything,
and I'm like,

35:03.812 --> 35:05.079
"I didn't say no
to everything."

35:05.080 --> 35:06.346
That's what
I'm pissed off about.

35:06.347 --> 35:08.282
Somebody as big as Kimmie

35:08.283 --> 35:10.150
should be able
to stand up for herself.

35:10.151 --> 35:12.186
I think the people
on the red team

35:12.187 --> 35:14.521
don't respect her,
and we have good reason.

35:14.522 --> 35:16.356
<i>I didn't call her out up there.</i>

35:16.357 --> 35:17.991
Right.
I didn't say that.

35:17.992 --> 35:19.293
<i>You gonna [bleep]
call me out like that?</i>

35:19.294 --> 35:20.961
That shows your character now.

35:20.962 --> 35:22.830
Kimmie never takes fault
for anything.

35:22.831 --> 35:26.033
I've been nothing but helping
this girl out

35:26.034 --> 35:28.268
since the [bleep] beginning.

35:28.269 --> 35:30.404
We will not make
any progress with her.

35:30.405 --> 35:32.106
The only thing
that we're gonna do

35:32.107 --> 35:34.274
is put ourselves
even further behind.

35:34.275 --> 35:37.211
Kimmie's usefulness is running
thin with the red team.

35:37.212 --> 35:39.379
I can't push someone
who doesn't want to be pushed.

35:39.380 --> 35:41.615
Nobody's really talking about

35:41.616 --> 35:43.317
the fact that I fried
the [bleep] eggplant.

35:43.318 --> 35:44.852
So thank God for that.

35:47.689 --> 35:50.457
Somehow, she just
keeps [bleep] skating by.

35:50.458 --> 35:52.059
<i>I don't give a [bleep]
how tall you are,</i>

35:52.060 --> 35:53.327
how big you are,

35:53.328 --> 35:54.928
<i>do not step up to me like that.</i>

35:54.929 --> 35:57.364
<i>(Kimmie)
Leave me the [bleep] alone.</i>

35:57.365 --> 35:59.533
It's ridiculous. We have
to [bleep] talk about it.

35:59.534 --> 36:00.834
Red team's breaking down
from the inside out.

36:00.835 --> 36:02.703
And it's... it is not good.

36:02.704 --> 36:05.272
Even the two that were
ride-or-die with each other

36:05.273 --> 36:06.907
are not even in the same room.

36:10.745 --> 36:13.914
(Announcer) After a day of
hard work for the women

36:13.915 --> 36:15.516
and hard play for the men,

36:15.517 --> 36:18.218
both teams get to bed early.

36:18.219 --> 36:20.621
But one chef
is feeling the pressure.

36:20.622 --> 36:22.256
So he gets up early.

36:22.257 --> 36:24.224
Let's go, people!
Wake up!

36:24.225 --> 36:26.260
(Announcer) And decides he
shouldn't be the only one.

36:26.261 --> 36:28.195
(Clemenza)
It's my dish on the menu.

36:28.196 --> 36:29.596
I'm not gonna waste time.

36:29.597 --> 36:30.831
[Bleep] gonna get done.

36:30.832 --> 36:32.399
<i>It's time to start your day.</i>

36:32.400 --> 36:33.767
If I gotta crack the whip
on some people,

36:33.768 --> 36:34.735
I'm [bleep] doing it.

36:34.736 --> 36:36.036
<i>Everybody get the [bleep] up!</i>

36:36.037 --> 36:37.037
<i>Wake up!</i>

36:37.038 --> 36:38.338
Shut up, Clemenza.

36:38.339 --> 36:39.606
Get your ass back into bed.

36:39.607 --> 36:41.275
Get up, get up, get up!

36:41.276 --> 36:42.309
Clemenza's shouting.

36:42.310 --> 36:43.677
<i>Let's go, people!</i>

36:43.678 --> 36:45.078
Shouting and shouting
and shouting.

36:45.079 --> 36:45.913
(Clemenza)
I'm [bleep] ready to go.

36:45.914 --> 36:48.048
It was [bleep] wonderful.

36:48.049 --> 36:50.350
(Announcer) As the chefs
get their day started,

36:50.351 --> 36:52.986
preparations are beginning
for tonight's fashion show.

36:52.987 --> 36:55.289
<i>I want the models
all done with hair and makeup.</i>

36:55.290 --> 36:56.723
<i>Please finish up.</i>

36:56.724 --> 36:58.792
(Announcer)
And with a brand-new menu,

36:58.793 --> 37:02.062
the kitchens definitely have
their work cut out for them.

37:02.063 --> 37:03.063
We're gonna do this.

37:03.064 --> 37:04.498
<i>Who set up fish?</i>

37:04.499 --> 37:06.166
<i>I did.
You should keep that organized.</i>

37:06.167 --> 37:07.901
<i>Where's that little bit
of clam stock?</i>

37:07.902 --> 37:09.503
Clam juice.
What are you doing?

37:09.504 --> 37:10.637
You taking my station over now?

37:10.638 --> 37:12.172
Come on, come on, man.

37:12.173 --> 37:15.776
Clemenza... Take a breath
for a [bleep] second.

37:15.777 --> 37:17.844
We're all a team.
We're all in this together.

37:17.845 --> 37:19.746
Justin, when you gonna
have some free time?

37:19.747 --> 37:21.315
<i>Um... I don't know.</i>

37:21.316 --> 37:23.617
The puttanesca
is Clemenza's recipe.

37:23.618 --> 37:24.885
But it's not really a big deal.

37:24.886 --> 37:25.886
It's not like making a...

37:25.887 --> 37:27.654
a crazy thing, you know.

37:27.655 --> 37:28.855
Just quick tomato sauce.

37:28.856 --> 37:30.224
[Bleep] peeling potatoes.

37:30.225 --> 37:31.158
This guy's making
a [bleep] appetizer.

37:31.159 --> 37:32.459
Clemenze...

37:32.460 --> 37:34.261
Don't [bleep] start

37:34.262 --> 37:36.230
yelling under your
[bleep] breath, all right?

37:36.231 --> 37:37.864
I said you're
[bleep] peelin' potatoes,

37:37.865 --> 37:38.966
this guy's over there
choppin' [bleep] lobster.

37:38.967 --> 37:40.267
<i>That's what I said.</i>

37:40.268 --> 37:41.668
I'm gonna say it
to your [bleep] face.

37:41.669 --> 37:43.337
Help me the [bleep] out,
[Bleep]!

37:43.338 --> 37:45.405
[Bleep] bitch about
everything, man.

37:45.406 --> 37:47.374
(Announcer) While frustration
mounts in the blue kitchen,

37:47.375 --> 37:49.285
over in the red kitchen...

37:50.612 --> 37:52.879
The fallout from
yesterday's challenge

37:52.880 --> 37:54.481
is turning toxic.

37:54.482 --> 37:56.350
She lost it for us because
she didn't listen to me.

37:56.351 --> 37:58.518
We need to put some kind
of seasoning on there.

38:00.989 --> 38:03.156
Quite bland.

38:03.157 --> 38:05.659
What about spices?
Right.

38:05.660 --> 38:07.361
<i>(Kimmie) Robyn, I don't
want to talk about this.</i>

38:07.362 --> 38:08.362
<i>Let's move on.</i>

38:08.363 --> 38:09.830
<i>But it's not dead yet.
It's not dead yet.</i>

38:09.831 --> 38:11.064
I'm not gonna drop it.

38:11.065 --> 38:12.366
I wanna [bleep] discuss it.

38:12.367 --> 38:13.900
And if you hide it from me,

38:13.901 --> 38:15.369
then that makes me wonder
about your character.

38:15.370 --> 38:16.937
I didn't sabotage you,
and I just...

38:16.938 --> 38:19.373
I never... those words
never came out of my mouth.

38:19.374 --> 38:21.341
See, now you're putting
words into my mouth.

38:21.342 --> 38:23.510
No, I'm not telling you
that you said that.

38:23.511 --> 38:25.145
Kimmie doesn't want
to admit to anything,

38:25.146 --> 38:26.280
because she's [bleep] weak.

38:26.281 --> 38:27.281
Kimmie...

38:27.282 --> 38:28.815
Don't talk to me right now.

38:28.816 --> 38:30.217
I'm done with Robyn
walking over me.

38:30.218 --> 38:31.718
[Crying]

38:31.719 --> 38:32.753
Uhh!

38:32.754 --> 38:34.988
I'm just so [bleep] mad that,

38:34.989 --> 38:36.423
I mean, if I could
hit her, I would.

38:46.740 --> 38:48.875
(Announcer) Tonight,
Hell's Kitchen is opening

38:48.876 --> 38:50.276
for its first-ever
fashion night.

38:50.277 --> 38:52.479
Ooh la-la.
Gorgeous.

38:52.480 --> 38:54.714
(Announcer) And while the models
are getting ready backstage,

38:54.715 --> 38:56.950
Robyn and Kimmie
continue to fight.

38:56.951 --> 38:59.085
Kimmie...
Don't talk to me right now.

38:59.086 --> 39:01.254
(Announcer) And now the red
team is one chef short.

39:01.255 --> 39:04.491
Robyn pushed me to a limit
I never thought I would get to.

39:04.492 --> 39:06.993
This was a kick in the stomach,
and at this point,

39:06.994 --> 39:08.161
she's kind of like my enemy.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.034
<i>(Gordon) Let's go, ladies.</i>

39:15.035 --> 39:16.069
<i>Robyn...</i>

39:16.070 --> 39:17.270
I need to see a bit of...

39:17.271 --> 39:18.271
Excitement?

39:18.272 --> 39:19.506
A bit of consistency.

39:19.507 --> 39:21.007
Yes, chef.
I mean, when you

39:21.008 --> 39:22.976
screwed it for your team
across the challenge,

39:22.977 --> 39:24.644
that's gone, but you gotta start
nailing it a little bit now.

39:24.645 --> 39:25.712
Yes, chef.

39:29.383 --> 39:30.783
Robyn, [bleep].

39:32.119 --> 39:33.953
Robyn is just trying
to be a little bitch.

39:33.954 --> 39:35.522
But, you know,
that's just how she is.

39:35.523 --> 39:37.323
So I'm gonna have
to put it aside

39:37.324 --> 39:38.791
and buckle down with the girls

39:38.792 --> 39:40.026
and get through dinner service.

39:40.027 --> 39:42.328
I mean, that's all we can do.

39:42.329 --> 39:44.163
(Announcer) With Hell's Kitchen
moments from opening...

39:44.164 --> 39:45.598
Line up, please.

39:45.599 --> 39:47.367
(Announcer)
Chef Ramsay gathers the chefs

39:47.368 --> 39:48.768
for some last minute
instructions.

39:48.769 --> 39:50.336
Tonight is our first-ever

39:50.337 --> 39:51.671
<i>Hell's Kitchen fashion night.</i>

39:51.672 --> 39:53.306
<i>And I want success.</i>

39:53.307 --> 39:54.641
(All) Yes, chef!

39:54.642 --> 39:56.075
<i>Listen carefully.</i>

39:56.076 --> 39:57.577
<i>The first catwalk takes place</i>

39:57.578 --> 39:59.512
before we serve appetizers.

39:59.513 --> 40:01.281
Once we've served
the appetizers,

40:01.282 --> 40:03.149
<i>the next part
of the show then starts.</i>

40:03.150 --> 40:04.918
After that,
we'll serve our entrees.

40:04.919 --> 40:06.019
<i>Everybody understands?</i>

40:06.020 --> 40:07.086
(All) Yes, chef!

40:07.087 --> 40:08.621
If there was ever a night

40:08.622 --> 40:10.390
<i>that timing was
absolutely critical,</i>

40:10.391 --> 40:11.791
it is tonight.

40:11.792 --> 40:13.726
<i>Because the finesse
of those plates</i>

40:13.727 --> 40:15.695
<i>really need to look stunning,</i>

40:15.696 --> 40:16.863
<i>I would like</i>

40:16.864 --> 40:18.531
one person from each team

40:18.532 --> 40:19.766
help plate.

40:19.767 --> 40:22.135
<i>Red team, Kimmie.</i>

40:22.136 --> 40:23.269
In the window
with Andy and I.

40:23.270 --> 40:24.203
Yes, chef.

40:24.204 --> 40:25.204
<i>Blue team...</i>

40:25.205 --> 40:26.205
Royce.

40:26.206 --> 40:27.574
Yes, chef.

40:27.575 --> 40:30.043
Trust me, these are not
easy customers tonight.

40:30.044 --> 40:31.110
<i>Let me tell you that.</i>

40:31.111 --> 40:33.146
Do not screw it up.

40:33.147 --> 40:34.981
Go in your sections.
Let's go, guys.

40:34.982 --> 40:36.382
<i>(All) Yes, chef.
Let's go.</i>

40:36.383 --> 40:37.750
The biggest
crucial moment so far

40:37.751 --> 40:38.952
is the timing of tonight.

40:38.953 --> 40:40.353
We gotta get it right.

40:40.354 --> 40:42.488
Let's [bleep] do it.

40:42.489 --> 40:44.857
Cut the makeup now, please,

40:44.858 --> 40:46.893
and give me the girls,
dressed, in order.

40:46.894 --> 40:48.595
(Announcer) Minutes before
Hell's Kitchen opens

40:48.596 --> 40:50.463
for its first-ever
fashion night,

40:50.464 --> 40:51.764
the red team...

40:51.765 --> 40:54.367
Uh, ladies,
once that last model

40:54.368 --> 40:55.969
has walked off the catwalk...

40:55.970 --> 40:57.637
<i>Bang, we go.
(All) Yes, chef.</i>

40:57.638 --> 40:59.038
(Announcer) Is standing
by, ready for action.

40:59.039 --> 41:01.140
<i>Is everyone ready?</i>

41:01.141 --> 41:03.109
(Announcer) Meanwhile,
in the blue kitchen...

41:03.110 --> 41:04.544
Let's go.

41:04.545 --> 41:06.613
(Announcer) Clemenza,
on the fish station,

41:06.614 --> 41:07.680
is waiting for no one.

41:07.681 --> 41:09.449
<i>(Gordon) Stop!</i>

41:09.450 --> 41:11.084
<i>Clemenza...</i>

41:11.085 --> 41:12.785
What are you doing?

41:12.786 --> 41:13.820
Scallops, chef.

41:13.821 --> 41:16.556
<i>We're not even open yet.</i>

41:16.557 --> 41:18.992
<i>Why is he cooking
the scallops?!</i>

41:18.993 --> 41:22.295
<i>Oh, God, Clemenza.</i>

41:22.296 --> 41:23.963
How many portions
of scallops have we wasted?

41:23.964 --> 41:25.164
Four.

41:25.165 --> 41:26.432
Clemenza, what the [bleep]
are you doing?

41:26.433 --> 41:27.166
Clemenza...

41:27.167 --> 41:28.668
<i>I'm [bleep] pissed off!</i>

41:28.669 --> 41:30.036
Oh, my God.

41:30.037 --> 41:31.738
Someone's leaving right now.

41:31.739 --> 41:33.206
Ready to go home?
No way, chef!
