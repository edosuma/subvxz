WEBVTT

00:09.009 --> 00:10.677
Mo-mi, are you ready?

00:13.722 --> 00:15.974
Wow! Wasn't that
a great performance?

00:16.057 --> 00:19.728
Next, we have a solo performance
by Miss Mo-mi Kim from Love Kindergarten!

00:19.811 --> 00:21.896
Please give her a big round of applause.

00:39.289 --> 00:40.957
My name is Mo-mi Kim.

00:42.083 --> 00:45.336
When I was younger,
my dream was to become a celebrity.

00:47.630 --> 00:51.134
Nothing made me as happy
as dancing onstage.

01:13.490 --> 01:18.745
The sound of people cheering
and applauding made me so, so happy.

01:24.125 --> 01:25.502
But eventually,

01:25.585 --> 01:28.546
my looks made it hard
for my dreams to come true.

01:30.632 --> 01:31.716
Whoo!

01:32.217 --> 01:33.384
What are you doing?

01:39.015 --> 01:41.643
You wanna be a singer
with those looks?

01:43.520 --> 01:44.979
Maybe in your dreams.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.820
I've always wondered

01:52.529 --> 01:56.324
how is it possible
that my mom is pretty, but I'm not.

02:02.038 --> 02:05.375
SUJEONG MIDDLE SCHOOL TRIP
TALENT SHOW

02:05.458 --> 02:08.378
Even in middle school nothing changed.

02:08.461 --> 02:11.297
Actually, it got worse.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.424
Wow, she's ugly!

02:13.508 --> 02:15.218
Loser. How boring.

02:15.301 --> 02:18.263
Next up is a performance
by Class Five from Grade Eight.

02:18.346 --> 02:20.974
Give them a big round of applause!

02:37.073 --> 02:41.077
THE 8TH SCHOOL FESTIVAL
JEONGMIN GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL

02:45.373 --> 02:47.333
Hey. You're blocking the view.

02:48.376 --> 02:49.335
Scooch down, c'mon.

02:52.088 --> 02:52.922
More.

02:54.966 --> 02:55.925
Good.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.388
As time went by,

03:00.471 --> 03:02.557
my dream slowly faded away.

03:07.145 --> 03:09.522
I am already 27 years old,

03:11.024 --> 03:13.318
and despite my will
to live a different life,

03:14.235 --> 03:17.447
I ended up having
an ordinary, uneventful one.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.894
But the sound
of applause and cheering

03:47.977 --> 03:50.230
is still my favorite thing to hear.

04:13.211 --> 04:14.379
Hi everyone.

04:14.462 --> 04:16.673
Let's get started
with tonight's live stream.

MO-MI KIM

07:53.723 --> 07:54.557
Hey. Mo-mi.

07:55.141 --> 07:56.267
Hey, Sang-sun.

08:00.688 --> 08:02.356
So, you look beat, what happened?

08:03.691 --> 08:05.860
-Do I?
-Your face looks really rough.

08:06.777 --> 08:08.738
You've been looking like that
a lot recently.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.324
You do something else after work?

08:12.575 --> 08:13.493
No, I don't.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.161
Yeah?

08:16.954 --> 08:18.873
Mr. Oh, have some coffee.

08:18.956 --> 08:21.125
Oh, thank you, thank you.

08:22.376 --> 08:23.211
Mr. Kim?

08:23.753 --> 08:26.506
-Have some coffee.
-Oh, thank you!

08:27.507 --> 08:28.466
Oh, this is great.

08:28.549 --> 08:31.093
You make the best coffee
in this office, A-reum.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.513
It's just a mix,
instant coffee, so…

08:33.596 --> 08:35.473
No way. It really tastes different.

08:35.556 --> 08:38.434
The person who makes the coffee
can have a big impact.

08:41.437 --> 08:43.064
You're in another league.

08:43.898 --> 08:45.316
Yeah, you're right.

08:45.399 --> 08:48.110
A whole different league, for sure.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.904
Those frickin' old men.

08:49.987 --> 08:52.657
-Pissing me off and it's only morning.
-Tell me about it.

08:52.740 --> 08:55.076
They don't even know
that's sexual harassment.

08:55.159 --> 08:56.577
I'll report them to HR one day.

08:56.661 --> 08:58.496
They need to be taught a lesson.

08:58.579 --> 09:01.666
Why is A-reum strutting around,
handing out coffee?

09:01.749 --> 09:03.876
She's a disgrace
to female employees.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.963
I think she got work done
on her eyes and nose.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.882
Nothing gets past ya.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.676
She uses bra pads too.

09:11.759 --> 09:15.429
-She's probably not even a 34A.
-I don't like her at all.

09:15.513 --> 09:18.641
She's new to the team
and already flirting left and right.

09:18.724 --> 09:22.061
-She's so full of herself.
-Oh, hello. Good morning.

09:22.144 --> 09:25.565
-Hey, Mr. Park's here.
-Yeah, good morning. Mm-hmm. Hello.

09:43.207 --> 09:44.250
-Mr. Park.
-Hey.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.961
-Have some coffee.
-Oh, I'm okay, thanks.

09:48.754 --> 09:49.589
Well…

09:50.256 --> 09:51.340
I'll have some, then.

09:52.633 --> 09:54.051
And by the way, Ms. Lee.

09:55.261 --> 09:57.138
You don't have to do this, you know?

09:57.972 --> 10:00.182
You're not here to make coffee, are you?

10:00.266 --> 10:02.393
Right. Understood, sir.

10:03.561 --> 10:05.313
As expected of Mr. Park,

10:06.105 --> 10:09.567
he is… so different from other men.

10:09.650 --> 10:11.277
A MONTH AGO

10:11.360 --> 10:15.031
When comparing the net profit
made in '07 and '08 by competitors,

10:15.114 --> 10:18.409
who were late to enter
the business of smart mobile systems…

10:18.492 --> 10:21.370
They say
that when you fall in love with someone,

10:21.454 --> 10:23.456
a new universe gets opened.

10:24.290 --> 10:28.628
It feels like the world you knew
until yesterday suddenly disappears.

10:28.711 --> 10:30.630
…2000s, when the system was developed,

10:30.713 --> 10:34.008
our position has been unmatched
as the industry's leader.

10:34.091 --> 10:37.345
Therefore, for the next ten years…

10:37.428 --> 10:39.847
He's as tall as a model.

10:39.930 --> 10:41.849
And he can pull off any suit.

10:43.434 --> 10:45.019
His broad shoulders…

10:45.853 --> 10:47.021
he's so hot.

10:47.104 --> 10:49.065
His face screams intelligence.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.941
He can seem cold sometimes…

10:51.984 --> 10:54.945
-Hello.
-…but he's actually very kind.

10:55.029 --> 10:57.073
He's so good at his job.

10:57.156 --> 10:59.909
He climbed the promotion ladder superfast.

10:59.992 --> 11:02.370
The only downside to this perfect man

11:03.412 --> 11:05.706
is that he's a married man.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.587
I know I shouldn't be doing this,

11:12.254 --> 11:14.924
but whenever I notice
he's focused on his work,

11:15.007 --> 11:16.926
I can't take my eyes off of him.

11:38.572 --> 11:39.657
Oh my God.

11:41.325 --> 11:43.202
She looks so good now.

11:45.871 --> 11:48.874
DROP-DEAD GORGEOUS

Wow, Once Upon A Prince!
Thank you for the 5,000 hearts!

13:00.905 --> 13:03.991
I'm completely wet,
so I'll go change real quick.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.995
Sorry I kept you waiting.

13:08.078 --> 13:10.164
I changed my hairstyle. Do you like it?

13:10.247 --> 13:11.791
Do you think it's pretty, hmm?

13:11.874 --> 13:12.875
ONCE UPON A PRINCE:
YOU LOOK GOOD IN ANYTHING

13:12.958 --> 13:13.834
Am I pretty?

13:13.918 --> 13:15.377
SO PRETTY
IT'S PRETTY! YOU'RE THE BEST

13:15.461 --> 13:17.588
You wanna know what my face looks like?

13:17.671 --> 13:19.548
I WON'T VOMIT. YOU MUST BE HELLA UGLY

13:19.632 --> 13:20.841
Ah…

13:20.925 --> 13:22.635
ONCE UPON A PRINCE: IGNORE THOSE COMMENTS

13:22.718 --> 13:24.178
THERE ARE SO MANY WEIRDOS AROUND

13:24.261 --> 13:25.638
Don't worry, guys.

13:25.721 --> 13:28.432
Stuff like that
doesn't hurt me.

13:28.933 --> 13:32.686
Besides, you do know
that these are real, right?

13:33.687 --> 13:35.022
HANDSOME MONK: SO SELF-CONFIDENT!

13:35.105 --> 13:38.442
I'm so happy because I have you all.

13:38.526 --> 13:41.070
You know what? I love all of you.

13:41.153 --> 13:43.155
YOU'RE THE BEST, MASK GIRL! THE BEST!!!

13:43.239 --> 13:45.491
This is the worst one ever.

13:46.325 --> 13:48.702
Ms. Mo-mi Kim.
Didn't you study accounting?

13:49.453 --> 13:53.415
How on earth could you get
the most basic accounting concept wrong?

13:54.792 --> 13:56.001
I'm sorry, sir.

14:10.641 --> 14:11.809
What are you doing?

14:16.814 --> 14:20.442
That was too harsh, wasn't it?
Embarrassing you in front of everybody.

14:20.943 --> 14:23.946
There's a lot of guys out there
who think they're the shit

14:24.029 --> 14:26.657
and don't know how to be kind
to other people, so…

14:26.740 --> 14:28.868
I call them "workplace bullies," you know?

14:30.744 --> 14:32.621
You've seen Park's social media,
haven't you?

14:33.706 --> 14:35.207
I don't follow him, so no.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.293
Mr. Park has an illness.

14:38.002 --> 14:38.878
What?

14:38.961 --> 14:40.296
Douchebag scum disease.

14:41.213 --> 14:45.634
Like, why… …would he post pictures
of his abs on there? It's gross. I mean…

14:46.468 --> 14:48.387
For real? He posted that?

14:50.389 --> 14:51.724
Can you show me those?

14:53.100 --> 14:55.853
You're sick too, apparently.

14:56.353 --> 14:58.731
How am I the only normal person
in this company?

14:58.814 --> 15:00.816
Hey! Where are you going?

15:01.317 --> 15:03.235
Come on! Show me the abs!

15:04.194 --> 15:05.571
What do you call a bear…

15:05.654 --> 15:06.488
Yeah.

15:06.572 --> 15:09.533
…who fell from a cliff
and broke all his teeth?

15:10.701 --> 15:11.535
Um…

15:11.619 --> 15:12.661
A tooth…

15:12.745 --> 15:13.662
Tooth…

15:13.746 --> 15:14.580
Tooth…

15:14.663 --> 15:15.497
A gummy bear.

15:16.290 --> 15:17.458
Gummy bear…

15:17.541 --> 15:21.003
Wow! Gummy bear!
Gummy bear! Wow!

15:21.086 --> 15:23.339
That was a great one.
Oh no, is that empty?

15:23.422 --> 15:25.591
Mr. Park? Can I pour you a glass?

15:25.674 --> 15:28.052
Oh no, it's all right.
I'll do it myself, hmm?

15:28.552 --> 15:32.514
Mr. Park, uh, when a pretty girl like her
offers you a drink, you should accept.

15:32.598 --> 15:33.849
All good. All good.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.268
-Anyway, A-reum, I'll take it, then.
-Ah, sure.

15:39.813 --> 15:44.193
Mr. Oh. What you said and did just now
is sexual harassment, you know?

15:44.860 --> 15:48.322
Why would you say that?
I just asked her to pour me a drink.

15:48.405 --> 15:51.200
She's my junior employee.
How is this sexual harassment?

15:51.283 --> 15:53.118
-Listen…
-That's not what I'm saying.

15:53.202 --> 15:57.039
You know, Mr. Park doesn't like
female employees pouring him drinks.

15:57.122 --> 15:59.041
-Oh. I see.
-She's a junior employee.

15:59.124 --> 16:01.794
Doesn't matter if they're a man
or a woman. You're being ridiculous.

16:01.877 --> 16:03.837
Is a man touching a woman's chest

16:03.921 --> 16:05.714
the same as a woman
touching a man's chest?

16:05.798 --> 16:08.425
Ms. Yoo, did I happen to ask
to touch her chest?

16:08.509 --> 16:10.219
-Try to calm down.
-I just asked for a drink.

16:10.302 --> 16:11.887
-Is this her chest?
-Yeah, yeah.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.431
-I'm just saying.
-Whoa. That's enough.

16:14.515 --> 16:16.183
By the way, Mr. Park.

16:16.684 --> 16:20.437
Ooh! Did you happen to hear about this?

16:21.146 --> 16:24.608
-What is this?
-It's a new trend. Very popular, you know?

16:24.692 --> 16:25.985
They show up, start streaming,

16:26.068 --> 16:28.570
and everyone sends them
Heart Pangs left and right!

16:28.654 --> 16:31.865
-Gets really crazy, you know?
-Wha-- What are "Heart Pangs"?

16:31.949 --> 16:34.034
Basically money, of course.

16:34.118 --> 16:37.579
Lots of people have been doing it,
and they're making a lot of money.

16:38.163 --> 16:40.290
Ah!

16:40.374 --> 16:42.710
Young people
are out of their minds these days.

16:42.793 --> 16:45.004
Look,
the most popular one on here…

16:45.087 --> 16:46.588
Here. Mask Girl.

16:50.259 --> 16:51.927
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.680
-Here.
-It's okay. Don't worry about it.

16:54.763 --> 16:57.057
-I'm sorry.
-Whoa, Mr. Kim. Seriously?

16:57.141 --> 17:00.060
Watching that kinda stuff?
I'm so disappointed.

17:00.144 --> 17:02.354
"That kinda stuff"?
What do you mean by that?

17:02.438 --> 17:05.649
I'm just trying to keep up
with the latest trends, that's all.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.192
The latest trends!

17:07.276 --> 17:10.279
That guy's a jerk.
"Keep up with the trends," my ass.

17:10.362 --> 17:13.574
I'm sure he gets off by himself
while watching that dirty stuff.

17:13.657 --> 17:16.785
Uh, those live streams are not that dirty.

17:16.869 --> 17:17.703
What?

17:18.203 --> 17:19.038
Huh?

17:20.205 --> 17:25.210
Well, that stuff is called, uh… new media.
I read an article about it.

17:25.294 --> 17:27.755
People like interacting
like that these days, so…

17:27.838 --> 17:30.632
Yeah. "New media"? C'mon.

17:31.175 --> 17:32.092
Well,

17:32.801 --> 17:35.179
if you're going for a second round,
go for it.

17:36.180 --> 17:37.765
I'll be going home, I'm afraid.

17:37.848 --> 17:41.518
What are you talking about? No!
Mr. Park, you have to come with us!

17:41.602 --> 17:44.938
Yeah, that would be great,
but my wife said she's not feeling well.

17:45.022 --> 17:47.524
-Ah! Oh! Well, that's rough.
-Hmm.

17:47.608 --> 17:49.443
Yeah, you should go. Goodbye.

17:49.526 --> 17:50.736
Wait a second. My phone.

17:50.819 --> 17:53.655
Ah! You left something
at the table again, huh?

17:53.739 --> 17:57.785
Well. So, how about round two?
Just us? Cool?

17:57.868 --> 17:59.036
Cool!

17:59.119 --> 18:03.207
-Hell yeah!
-I'm sorry, but I should go home as well.

18:04.249 --> 18:06.752
Um, my mom is visiting tonight, so…

18:06.835 --> 18:10.297
Hey, c'mon. Didn't you say
you don't even talk to your mom?

18:10.380 --> 18:13.217
What are you saying?
Why wouldn't I talk to her?

18:13.300 --> 18:16.678
Sure, yeah, you can go home.
Your mom is visiting you from far away.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.263
So sure, go home. Uh…

18:18.806 --> 18:19.765
-A-reum.
-Uh-huh?

18:19.848 --> 18:21.350
You coming with us, right?

18:21.433 --> 18:23.602
Uh… of course!

18:23.685 --> 18:26.313
-Okay!
-Okay!

18:26.396 --> 18:28.232
What about you?

18:28.315 --> 18:29.316
Any other plans?

18:29.900 --> 18:30.818
I'm afraid not.

18:31.318 --> 18:34.530
Wait, what? Don't you--
Don't you have something to do at home?

18:34.613 --> 18:35.572
Mr. Oh.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.200
-Mr. Oh.
-Yes, sir.

18:38.283 --> 18:41.411
I'm aware of how you feel,
but how could you say that to her face?

18:41.495 --> 18:42.830
Oh, I'm sorry.

18:42.913 --> 18:43.831
Mr. Kim!

18:43.914 --> 18:47.000
-Right, I'm going home now.
-Yes, sir!

18:47.084 --> 18:50.671
-Don't drink too much, okay?
-Goodbye, sir.

18:50.754 --> 18:51.755
-Taxi!
-Bye!

18:53.674 --> 18:55.259
-Mr. Park?
-Hmm?

18:55.843 --> 18:58.762
Could we, maybe,
if you don't mind, share a taxi?

18:58.846 --> 19:01.431
-You live by Cheonpo-gu's office, right?
-Hmm?

19:02.099 --> 19:04.601
I moved to Osan Pass, you know, so…

19:05.310 --> 19:06.311
Oh, you did.

19:06.895 --> 19:07.896
Sure. Get in.

19:15.529 --> 19:16.864
Thank you so much.

19:17.865 --> 19:20.242
No worries. It's on the way, no problem.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.877
Uh, hello?

19:32.421 --> 19:34.047
Yeah, I'm on my way right now.

19:34.131 --> 19:34.965
Yeah.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.759
No, no, I didn't drink a lot. Mm-hmm.

19:37.843 --> 19:40.846
Well, I should be home in thirty, I guess.

19:42.306 --> 19:43.223
Right now?

19:48.187 --> 19:49.396
I'm alone. Why?

19:51.148 --> 19:52.816
Everyone went for another round.

19:57.237 --> 19:59.281
Okay, sure. Yeah. I'll see you in a bit.

20:00.407 --> 20:01.241
Yeah.

20:07.122 --> 20:08.665
Oh, that was my wife.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.627
Oh, right.

20:20.844 --> 20:23.805
Thank you! I'll see you tomorrow.

20:23.889 --> 20:25.307
Sure. No worries.

20:39.404 --> 20:42.658
Why did Mr. Park say he was alone?

20:44.076 --> 20:46.954
Why did he try to hide the fact
that I was with him?

20:48.997 --> 20:50.582
Was he conscious of me?

20:51.375 --> 20:52.417
But why?

20:53.543 --> 20:55.045
Is it possible?

21:00.550 --> 21:01.843
ONCE UPON A PRINCE: I WAS WAITING FOR YOU!

21:01.927 --> 21:02.928
HI
LET'S GET STARTED

21:03.011 --> 21:06.056
Guys, um… I wanna ask you something.

21:06.640 --> 21:07.683
Is that okay?

21:07.766 --> 21:08.892
WHAT IS IT?
ASK AWAY!

21:08.976 --> 21:11.979
I got into a taxi with my boss tonight.

21:12.062 --> 21:13.188
He's married.

21:13.772 --> 21:16.066
No! No! I didn't do it on purpose.

21:16.149 --> 21:19.152
Our houses were just
in the same direction, that's why.

21:19.236 --> 21:20.195
Anyway.

21:20.279 --> 21:23.282
While we were in the taxi,
he got a call from his wife.

21:23.365 --> 21:25.867
But even though
he was in the taxi with me,

21:25.951 --> 21:29.871
he lied to his wife
and told her that he was alone.

21:32.082 --> 21:34.710
Hmm, why do you think he did that?

21:34.793 --> 21:36.503
BRAD PIT:
HE COULDN'T BE BOTHERED TO EXPLAIN

21:36.586 --> 21:38.797
He could've just said
he was sharing the taxi

21:38.880 --> 21:41.008
with someone going in the same direction.

21:41.091 --> 21:42.217
HE HAS THE HOTS FOR YOU

21:42.301 --> 21:44.261
That's what it seems like, right?

21:44.344 --> 21:46.096
BRAD PIT: YOU'RE SO DELUSIONAL

21:48.557 --> 21:49.641
'BRAD PIT' HAS BEEN REMOVED

21:49.725 --> 21:51.226
Then how-- How about this?

21:51.310 --> 21:55.814
A while back, I told him like,
"Oh, your perfume smells really nice."

21:55.897 --> 21:59.359
And ever since I said that,
he's been wearing the same one.

21:59.443 --> 22:00.694
LOOKIE LOOKIE
JUST A COINCIDENCE?

22:01.486 --> 22:02.738
'LOOKIE LOOKIE' HAS BEEN REMOVED

22:02.821 --> 22:04.865
But of course, as I'm sure you all know,

22:04.948 --> 22:07.409
I don't have feelings for him. Not at all.

22:07.492 --> 22:10.203
HANDSOME MONK: CAREFUL OF MARRIED MEN!
NEED TO DRAW A CLEAR LINE

22:10.287 --> 22:11.705
Yeah, you're right.

22:11.788 --> 22:13.957
I should really draw the line.

22:14.041 --> 22:15.751
ONCE UPON A PRINCE:
IF YOU DATE THAT MAN, I'LL KILL MYSELF

22:15.834 --> 22:19.087
Hmm. I'm so touched!

22:19.755 --> 22:23.425
Guys, you do know
that I'll always be yours, right?

22:23.508 --> 22:25.177
I'm never gonna leave you!

22:25.260 --> 22:26.803
200 HOT HIGHSCHOOLER
1000 MADAM FANTASY

22:26.887 --> 22:28.680
I love all of you!

22:28.764 --> 22:32.017
I love you!

22:34.853 --> 22:38.482
Why does he look so serious today?

22:50.035 --> 22:50.952
Hmm.

23:00.712 --> 23:03.507
Breaking news!
Mr. Park updated his social media!

23:06.802 --> 23:08.095
PARK GI-HUN'S PAGE

23:09.179 --> 23:10.514
THINKING…
DEEP IN THOUGHT IN THIS COLD CITY

23:10.597 --> 23:13.850
God, this needs an intervention.
He needs treatment, doesn't he?

23:15.519 --> 23:17.729
This is serious, it really is.

23:17.813 --> 23:19.981
Just how many times
has it been?!

23:20.857 --> 23:21.733
Sorry, Mr. Park.

23:22.567 --> 23:23.860
Do it again.

23:38.417 --> 23:41.336
What's gotten into him?
He's even scolding that flirty fox.

23:41.420 --> 23:44.089
Work is work.
You mess up, you get scolded.

23:44.172 --> 23:46.967
You know Mr. Park is serious
when it comes to work.

24:08.238 --> 24:10.866
Do you have a lot left to do?

24:10.949 --> 24:13.493
Oh, well, no. I'm nearly done, actually.

24:13.577 --> 24:14.703
Mmm. All right.

24:16.204 --> 24:20.959
Oh… don't beat yourself up
about, uh, Mr. Park yelling at you.

24:21.042 --> 24:24.671
He's, uh, kinda nice,
but he can be a little

24:25.797 --> 24:27.507
cold, um, about work.

24:28.758 --> 24:30.218
Ah. Sure.

24:30.802 --> 24:32.179
Um, I'll be off, then.

24:32.262 --> 24:33.305
-Bye.
-Bye.

25:39.079 --> 25:41.373
Come on, don't be like that.

25:41.456 --> 25:45.585
I did that so no one could say
I was favoring you, you know?

25:46.086 --> 25:50.257
Still, you were too mean. I don't like it
when you do that in front of other people.

25:50.340 --> 25:53.552
Okay, okay.
You're prettier when you're angry.

28:06.810 --> 28:08.019
MASK GIRL! YOU'LL GET SUSPENDED

28:08.103 --> 28:10.188
THOSE ARE REAL BOOBS
OH NO. MASK GIRL :(

28:10.271 --> 28:11.523
SHIT, I'M LATE. SHARE THE VIDEO

28:11.606 --> 28:13.566
COULD'VE SEEN HER FACE
IF SHE WENT ON A BIT

28:13.650 --> 28:15.026
BUT THE MASK STAYS ON
FUCK! IS SHE NUTS?

28:15.110 --> 28:16.319
A REAL-TIME NUDE SHOW, CRAZY

28:16.403 --> 28:17.821
ALL NUDE, FUCKING CRAZY
WHAT A SHAME!

28:17.904 --> 28:23.284
CHAT SERVICES WILL BE LIMITED
DURING SUSPENSION

28:25.036 --> 28:30.500
STREAMER SUSPENDED DUE TO VIOLATION
OF RULES AND CONDUCT DURING LIVE STREAM

29:15.545 --> 29:18.965
STREAMER SUSPENDED DUE TO VIOLATION
OF RULES AND CONDUCT DURING LIVE STREAM

29:19.924 --> 29:22.218
A REAL-TIME NUDE SHOW, CRAZY
ALL NUDE, FUCKING CRAZY

29:22.302 --> 29:24.012
Die.

29:24.095 --> 29:25.430
Die, Mo-mi Kim.

29:26.306 --> 29:28.516
Just die. You deserve to die!

29:32.312 --> 29:34.606
This is all because of A-reum.

29:34.689 --> 29:36.316
That deceitful bitch.

29:37.066 --> 29:38.818
If it hadn't been for her…

29:38.902 --> 29:40.570
Hey, over here! Mo-mi.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.407
-Hey, c'mon.
-There you are.

29:44.491 --> 29:46.367
-I'm starving.
-You're always late.

29:46.451 --> 29:48.620
What? That's your phone? An iPhone?

29:48.703 --> 29:51.790
These are the colleagues
I regularly meet up with.

29:51.873 --> 29:53.833
I went stress shopping and got one.

29:53.917 --> 29:55.543
Once they start talking,

29:55.627 --> 29:58.963
it's only a matter of time
until the rumors start spreading.

30:01.341 --> 30:02.467
By the way…

30:03.092 --> 30:04.803
I saw something

30:06.221 --> 30:07.138
strange recently.

30:07.222 --> 30:09.224
Something strange? What's up?

30:10.850 --> 30:11.684
Well…

30:15.063 --> 30:15.980
Forget it.

30:18.316 --> 30:21.444
-I hate it when you do that, you know?
-How annoying.

30:21.945 --> 30:24.280
-Seriously. What is it?
-Come on, just tell us.

30:24.364 --> 30:27.158
-Yeah, what the heck?
-It's a big secret, though.

30:28.284 --> 30:29.536
Don't tell anyone, okay?

30:30.036 --> 30:32.163
Of course! You can trust us!

30:37.001 --> 30:38.670
-Really?!
-Wow, I just got chills.

30:38.753 --> 30:40.046
I'm not that surprised.

30:40.129 --> 30:41.840
Doesn't Mr. Park have a kid?

30:41.923 --> 30:43.633
-He does!
-Good morning!

30:43.716 --> 30:45.218
Oh! Hello, sir!

30:45.301 --> 30:47.846
Mm-hmm. Oh. Enjoy your coffee.

30:51.641 --> 30:53.685
A-reum's so cute, man.

30:55.937 --> 30:58.022
That Mr. Park is a fuckin' piece of shit.

30:58.898 --> 31:00.984
He has it all but wants more, that jerk.

31:02.360 --> 31:04.737
I mean, how could she do that, though?

31:04.821 --> 31:05.780
I know, right?

31:06.531 --> 31:08.575
Doesn't she feel bad for the man's wife?

31:08.658 --> 31:12.370
She probably thinks that
they're both gonna get away with it, huh?

31:24.507 --> 31:25.383
Wow!

31:25.466 --> 31:29.304
New gossip. Apparently, A-reum's pregnant,
and she's still coming into work.

31:29.387 --> 31:31.014
-Come on!
-I know, right?

31:31.097 --> 31:32.557
No, she already had the baby,

31:32.640 --> 31:35.018
and he's been leading a double life
for a while.

31:35.101 --> 31:36.477
-Oh my gosh.
-Isn't it wild?

31:36.561 --> 31:37.645
What? Really?

31:39.188 --> 31:40.356
That's not true at all!

31:41.357 --> 31:42.567
Leading a double life?

31:43.109 --> 31:45.445
They have a kid? That's ridiculous.

31:54.162 --> 31:56.748
Mr. Park and A-reum
are in a meeting with HR.

31:56.831 --> 31:58.666
Really? Why?

31:58.750 --> 32:01.336
Why else?
They found out about their affair.

32:01.419 --> 32:02.670
Oh no!

32:02.754 --> 32:05.256
What do you mean?
You. Told. Everyone.

32:21.147 --> 32:22.482
Um, excuse me…

32:23.107 --> 32:24.317
Yes?

32:28.655 --> 32:30.114
Uh, it's nothing.

32:30.740 --> 32:31.574
Nothing.

32:59.852 --> 33:00.687
Oh!

33:01.187 --> 33:02.188
Sorry about that.

33:05.400 --> 33:06.234
Taxi!

33:06.734 --> 33:07.568
Taxi!

33:08.069 --> 33:08.903
Taxi!

33:09.570 --> 33:10.571
Shucks!

33:12.615 --> 33:13.658
They already--

33:14.283 --> 33:15.827
Everyone-- Left.

33:17.078 --> 33:18.997
They all left.

33:20.665 --> 33:23.960
All… all gone.

33:28.506 --> 33:29.340
Mr. Park.

33:34.220 --> 33:35.138
What the hell?

33:37.306 --> 33:38.975
A telephone pole is talking.

33:41.144 --> 33:42.603
What the heck is goin' on?

33:43.104 --> 33:45.940
Whoa! Mr. Park, are you okay?

33:51.487 --> 33:55.533
-Uh, screw it.
-Oh-- Uh-- Mr. Park, you're very drunk.

33:55.616 --> 33:57.827
What are you doing? Let go!

33:57.910 --> 34:01.372
Hey, let go. Just-- Let go!

34:03.750 --> 34:05.960
-I'm going to die!
-Wait, don't!

34:06.044 --> 34:08.129
-What are you doing?!
-I'm going to die!

34:08.212 --> 34:11.549
-Don't!
-Actually almost died.

34:12.467 --> 34:14.427
Hey! Taxi!

34:43.831 --> 34:46.542
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

34:47.752 --> 34:49.045
Uh, Mr. Park.

34:51.089 --> 34:53.424
Pull yourself together, come on. Okay?

34:53.925 --> 34:57.053
We're, uh, at Cheonpo-gu's office,
right here.

34:57.887 --> 35:00.598
Where did you say you live? Huh?

35:00.681 --> 35:02.558
Oh. Mr. Park!

35:09.732 --> 35:11.025
What, really?

35:12.193 --> 35:15.238
There's no saving them.

35:15.321 --> 35:16.864
Stupid company.

35:16.948 --> 35:19.951
MOTEL

35:47.979 --> 35:48.813
Uh…

36:11.836 --> 36:13.921
Your clothes are soaking wet.

36:25.141 --> 36:26.642
Uh!

36:28.311 --> 36:30.897
Oh, Mr. Park.

36:33.482 --> 36:36.402
Uh, we shouldn't--
We shouldn't be doing this.

36:37.987 --> 36:39.697
We shouldn't. Don't you think so--

37:13.981 --> 37:16.359
Oh f-- Shit!

37:52.603 --> 37:55.982
Do you think it's okay to be late
now that Mr. Park isn't around?

37:56.482 --> 37:58.818
What? A delay at the subway again?

37:58.901 --> 38:01.612
I guess the subway
was really delayed.

38:07.994 --> 38:11.622
Mr. Park decided to quit,
and A-reum was transferred, so…

38:17.712 --> 38:19.046
-Ms. Kim.
-Yes?

38:19.130 --> 38:21.799
You didn't happen to send
the sales data yesterday, right?

38:22.633 --> 38:23.551
I'll send it right now.

38:33.394 --> 38:35.187

39:28.449 --> 39:29.700

39:30.785 --> 39:32.119

40:07.196 --> 40:09.615
NEW MESSAGE
TO: OFFICE MANAGER PARK GI-HUN

40:13.411 --> 40:15.704
MR. PARK, I'D LIKE TO MEET WITH YOU

40:19.375 --> 40:24.255
We're now entering Hapjeong.
Hapjeong. Doors will open both sides.

40:24.338 --> 40:25.339
Hey.

40:27.133 --> 40:28.134
What was that?

40:29.343 --> 40:30.219
What?

40:31.262 --> 40:32.721
You just touched me.

40:33.431 --> 40:37.393
-What do you mean, touched you?
-You touched my butt just now, didn't you?

40:37.977 --> 40:38.811
I did?

40:40.146 --> 40:41.272
Are you hallucinating?

40:42.148 --> 40:43.607
Why would I touch your butt?

40:43.691 --> 40:46.444
You-- You did it.
You touched my butt, you jerk.

40:52.241 --> 40:54.368
-Get off!
-Uh, why should I get off?

40:54.452 --> 40:56.871
-I'm telling you, get off!
-Why do I have to get off?

40:56.954 --> 40:58.122
Get off, right now!

40:58.205 --> 40:59.582
Ow!

41:02.293 --> 41:04.128
And, um, you're sure he touched you?

41:05.004 --> 41:07.173
Well, why would I tell you
if I wasn't sure?

41:07.923 --> 41:09.842
Can you prove I actually touched you?

41:10.718 --> 41:12.803
She's trying to frame an innocent person.

41:13.762 --> 41:15.097
Look in the mirror, c'mon.

41:15.598 --> 41:18.058
Why on earth
would I touch someone like you?

41:18.142 --> 41:20.603
Sir, please don't say that, c'mon.

41:20.686 --> 41:22.813
-You bastard! You little pervert!
-Ah! Sh--

41:22.897 --> 41:25.524
-You touched me. Now what?
-Stop that!

41:25.608 --> 41:29.195
What are you gonna do now?!
You sent the email, too, didn't you?

41:29.278 --> 41:30.738
It was you!

41:30.821 --> 41:33.115
It was you, wasn't it?
You're the one!

41:33.199 --> 41:34.783
You're saying

41:35.451 --> 41:36.869
he sent a weird email,

41:37.369 --> 41:39.747
then followed you around and molested you?

41:41.624 --> 41:45.336
Well, actually what I'm saying, uh…

41:45.419 --> 41:48.631
is that there's a good chance
this is the case.

41:48.714 --> 41:50.841
All right, well,

41:52.051 --> 41:53.552
why don't we just let this go?

41:54.386 --> 41:57.932
You've both got places to be,
so don't let this get out of hand.

41:58.015 --> 42:01.185
-Let's just try and move on, okay?
-How can I just "move on"?

42:02.478 --> 42:04.730
This bastard touched me, I swear.

42:05.397 --> 42:06.607
I can't move on.

42:07.316 --> 42:10.861
Ma'am, you assaulted him, right?
We saw you.

42:20.913 --> 42:22.414
Can't fucking believe this.

42:23.457 --> 42:24.917
What a shitty fucking day.

42:39.473 --> 42:40.307

43:36.739 --> 43:39.033
At least you're welcoming, huh?

43:48.292 --> 43:50.127
I THINK I MIGHT AS WELL
QUIT LIVE STREAMING NOW

43:50.210 --> 43:51.337
WHY? NO!

43:54.632 --> 43:58.260
I DON'T THINK I'M A WOMAN WHO CAN BE LOVED

44:00.721 --> 44:05.184
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU'RE SO CHARMING

44:19.698 --> 44:21.283

44:22.951 --> 44:24.745
