Greylock bucks.

we get to design our own money.

the faster we save the economy.

08:42.813 --> 08:43.940
Hey, what is all this?

08:44.023 --> 08:45.191
SARAH:
It's inspiration.

08:45.274 --> 08:47.443
It's different currencies
from around the world.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.863
CORINNE: These are money?

08:49.195 --> 08:50.863
SARAH: They were.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.448
In Micronesia.
They're called rai stones.

08:52.531 --> 08:55.701
The more people who died trying
to transport one of the stones,

08:55.785 --> 08:56.410
the more valuable it was.

08:56.494 --> 08:58.287
Charming.
Mm.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.622
Do we even need
a physical currency?

08:59.705 --> 09:02.458
Couldn't Greylock's
money be Bitcoin?

09:02.541 --> 09:04.919
Mm-hmm. That's what I said.

09:05.002 --> 09:06.629
I don't want to scare
anyone off by announcing

09:06.712 --> 09:08.422
we're switching
to Internet bucks.

09:08.506 --> 09:10.216
This only works
if everyone buys in.

09:10.299 --> 09:11.509
CORINNE:
They will.

09:11.592 --> 09:12.468
Yeah, they better.

09:12.551 --> 09:16.222
Okay, I have to go buy glitter.

09:16.305 --> 09:18.099
You guys are on design duty.

09:18.182 --> 09:19.558
Thank you.

09:18.182 --> 09:19.558
Glitter?

09:19.642 --> 09:22.353
You can mix it in a blender
to make color-changing ink.

09:22.436 --> 09:24.814
Super effective
anti-counterfeiting trick.

09:24.897 --> 09:28.818
Hmm. Is there any way we can
make the bulge a little bigger?

09:28.901 --> 09:30.569
(clears throat)

09:30.653 --> 09:33.281
Hello? Hello.

09:33.364 --> 09:36.158
Sorry, we're down a receptionist
at the moment.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.868
Can we help you?

09:36.242 --> 09:37.868
Yes.

09:37.952 --> 09:40.371
Um, I would like to
report a crime. Vandalism.

09:40.454 --> 09:42.498
My mailbox was... vandaled.

09:42.581 --> 09:45.334
I've got patrol,
but, uh, Johnson!

09:45.418 --> 09:47.545
It's all you, Johnson.

09:47.628 --> 09:50.089
Oh. Okay.

09:50.172 --> 09:52.383
Thank you.

09:53.926 --> 09:56.012
Well, ma'am,

09:56.095 --> 09:57.680
as the only officer
in the building,

09:57.763 --> 09:59.515
I suggest you file a statement.

09:59.598 --> 10:00.141
With me.

10:00.224 --> 10:02.935
In my office.

10:06.314 --> 10:08.524
(AJ chuckles)

10:08.607 --> 10:11.193
Ah, that thing
with your tongue...

10:11.277 --> 10:12.695
That thing
with your fingers.

10:12.778 --> 10:14.113
That thing with the...

10:14.196 --> 10:15.323
The handcuffs, yep.

10:14.196 --> 10:15.323
...the handcuffs.

10:15.406 --> 10:17.867
What did you do to that?

10:17.950 --> 10:20.369
Oh, I whacked it
with a rolling pin.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.038
How else was I supposed
to see you?

10:22.121 --> 10:23.706
Choir is suspended

10:23.789 --> 10:25.875
until Gladys recovers
from her heart attack.

10:25.958 --> 10:27.543
Well, you know,
tampering with mail

10:27.626 --> 10:29.128
is a serious offense.

10:29.211 --> 10:30.546
You're gonna have to
get those handcuffs, then.

10:30.629 --> 10:32.465
Don't tempt me.

10:30.629 --> 10:32.465
(knock on door)

10:32.548 --> 10:33.674
One second!

10:35.134 --> 10:36.385
Yeah?

10:36.469 --> 10:38.429
Sorry, there's no receptionist,

10:38.512 --> 10:40.348
but I do need a signature.

10:42.808 --> 10:44.352
It's heavy. You want me to...

10:42.808 --> 10:44.352
Oh, no, it's...

10:44.435 --> 10:46.479
Right there is good.

10:44.435 --> 10:46.479
Okay.

10:46.562 --> 10:47.688
Thanks.

10:51.567 --> 10:53.027
He's gone.

10:53.110 --> 10:54.862
(sighs)

10:54.945 --> 10:56.072
It's safe.

10:56.155 --> 10:57.782
No.

10:57.865 --> 11:01.077
No, none of this is safe.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.538
SARAH:
I don't like this place.

11:04.622 --> 11:06.207
You don't have to like it.
You're not the one going.

11:06.290 --> 11:07.917
Sound baths and sweat lodges.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.753
It's supposed to be rehab,
not Burning Man.

11:10.836 --> 11:13.923
My mom needs a normal program

11:14.006 --> 11:15.674
at a normal facility.

11:15.758 --> 11:16.926
Since when have you been
interested in anything normal?

11:17.009 --> 11:21.097
Chakra revival is not
one of the 12 Steps,

11:21.180 --> 11:22.765
last I checked.

11:22.848 --> 11:24.809
The 12 Steps were invented
by two old white dudes.

11:24.892 --> 11:26.894
Your mother
is a modern woman.

11:26.977 --> 11:28.104
Maybe she needs
a modern approach.

11:28.187 --> 11:31.107
Maybe she needs
her head examined.

11:28.187 --> 11:31.107
Maybe

11:31.190 --> 11:33.025
her daughter needs to learn
that she can't control

11:33.109 --> 11:35.277
every detail
of other people's lives.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.196
It's not other people's lives,
Corinne.

11:37.279 --> 11:38.656
It's my mother.

11:38.739 --> 11:40.574
Pass me that wing, will you?

11:40.658 --> 11:42.326
Is this
Josh's bumblebee costume?

11:42.410 --> 11:43.828
Some little turd in his class
made fun of him

11:43.911 --> 11:47.248
and ripped the wing off,
so I have to fix it

11:47.331 --> 11:49.166
'cause he wants to wear it
to Cub Scouts.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.127
He wants to wear it again even
though he's gonna get teased?

11:51.210 --> 11:52.920
Yeah, he watched the documentary
about how the bees are dying,

11:53.003 --> 11:55.131
so it's his thing now.

11:55.214 --> 11:56.799
Well, it's not the choice
that I would make,

11:56.882 --> 11:59.552
but I can't live his life
for him.

11:59.635 --> 12:03.764
Wait, I guess that you could say

12:03.848 --> 12:05.474
I choose to support him

12:05.558 --> 12:06.851
even though
I don't totally agree with him.

12:06.934 --> 12:08.144
I see what you did there.

12:08.227 --> 12:13.524
Um, I would rather wear
a bumblebee costume myself

12:13.607 --> 12:14.650
than let my mom go

12:14.733 --> 12:17.736
to some stupid
hippie commune.

12:17.820 --> 12:20.072
I want to find her somewhere...

12:20.156 --> 12:21.574
I want to find her
somewhere better,

12:21.657 --> 12:24.660
somewhere
that will actually work.

No, he turned out

What do you mean?

12:55.357 --> 12:57.485
I don't know.

12:57.568 --> 12:58.652
Like, most of these couples
I recognize

12:58.736 --> 13:00.321
aren't really couples anymore.

13:00.404 --> 13:02.364
What about
you and me?

13:02.448 --> 13:04.033
We're still a couple, aren't we?

13:04.116 --> 13:06.327
Yeah, of course.

13:06.410 --> 13:09.038
Look, and even if
all these relationships failed,

but at least your wing
stayed on this time, right?

13:25.763 --> 13:27.306
I don't want to talk about it.

13:27.389 --> 13:29.475
Look, I know that
it hurts now,

13:29.558 --> 13:30.726
but I love that costume,

13:30.809 --> 13:32.728

13:32.811 --> 13:34.230
I said I don't want to talk.

13:34.313 --> 13:37.733
Wait, Josh.

Josh. Honey? Josh...

Josh, sweetie?

Whoa! Slow down there,
Mr. Bumblebee.

13:44.907 --> 13:47.826
I, uh, think you
dropped something.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.828
Looks like,
looks like an antenna.

13:49.912 --> 13:52.540
Very important.
You need one of these

13:52.623 --> 13:54.250
to, like, smell
and-and feel and...

13:54.333 --> 13:55.960
And measure wind speed.

13:56.043 --> 13:57.419
Want to tell me
what's going on, what's wrong?

13:59.255 --> 14:00.256
Josh!

14:00.339 --> 14:02.299
Anyone can wear pants
and a T-shirt.

14:02.383 --> 14:04.260
It takes a real superstar
to rock one of these.

14:04.343 --> 14:05.469
(panting)

14:05.553 --> 14:07.054
CORINNE:
Josh?

14:07.137 --> 14:09.431
Go wait by the car.
Stay on the sidewalk.

14:10.808 --> 14:12.476
What the hell are you doing?

14:12.560 --> 14:13.811
I'm just trying to help.

14:13.894 --> 14:15.312
I don't need your help, Danny.

14:15.396 --> 14:15.771
I've been doing fine
without you.

14:23.195 --> 14:25.072
CORINNE:
Before you die,
you see the Ring.

14:25.155 --> 14:27.116
Okay, that's actually
Harriet E. Wilson,

14:27.199 --> 14:27.825
the first African American
to publish a novel

14:27.908 --> 14:30.119
on this continent. Oh...

14:30.202 --> 14:31.287
Yeah, and I'm sure
that this is exactly

14:31.370 --> 14:33.789
how she would want
to be remembered.

14:33.872 --> 14:35.624
No. Hey. Maya.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.669
Yeah. The ink balance is off.

14:38.752 --> 14:40.212
Ugh. Bailey Pond looks like
the La Brea Tar Pits.

14:40.296 --> 14:42.631
Bella?

14:42.715 --> 14:44.174
Thought we agreed that
we were gonna spend time

14:44.258 --> 14:45.968
as a family before
you leave for Cabot.

14:46.051 --> 14:48.512
Well, I would rather be
with my friends.

14:48.596 --> 14:51.974
Bella, don't be difficult, okay?

14:52.057 --> 14:55.019
Or what, Dad, you'll ship me
off to boarding school again?

14:55.102 --> 14:55.894
Let's go. Come on.

14:55.978 --> 14:58.314
Bye, guys.
Bye, you guys.

14:58.397 --> 14:59.857
Bye.

14:58.397 --> 14:59.857
SARAH: Hey, William,
cut her some slack.

14:59.940 --> 15:02.318
She's just sad about leaving.

15:02.401 --> 15:03.944
Can't blame her
if she's a little snippy.

15:02.401 --> 15:03.944
WILLIAM: Oh, don't worry.

15:04.028 --> 15:04.820
When it comes
to my daughter losing her way,

15:04.903 --> 15:06.030
I know exactly who to blame.

15:06.113 --> 15:09.491
Just happy to be
getting her out of Greylock

15:09.575 --> 15:11.327
before your latest scheme
implodes.

15:11.410 --> 15:12.995
Oh, "scheme."
That's not patronizing at all.

15:13.078 --> 15:16.332
If you launch a currency
and it fails,

15:16.415 --> 15:18.042
the results
could be devastating.

15:18.125 --> 15:20.002
Have you ever heard of Nauru?

15:18.125 --> 15:20.002
Yes.

15:20.085 --> 15:23.714
Tiny island country in
Micronesia, big on phosphate.

15:23.797 --> 15:26.175
You do know I was a, I was
a teacher before this, right?

15:26.258 --> 15:29.595
Well, Nauru bet its future
on its resources,

15:29.678 --> 15:32.222
and when they were gone,
the whole island

15:32.306 --> 15:33.641
imploded in bankruptcy.

15:33.724 --> 15:35.351
Okay, we get it,
Debbie Downer.

15:35.434 --> 15:38.562
But for every Nauru
there's a Norway, another place

15:38.646 --> 15:39.688
that bet its future
on its natural resources

15:39.772 --> 15:42.191
and has one of the wealthiest,

15:42.274 --> 15:44.818
most stable economies
on Earth because of it.

15:44.902 --> 15:46.654
This is a mistake.

15:48.739 --> 15:49.907
SARAH:
<i>I want you to know</i>

15:49.990 --> 15:54.203
that I-- I support you
going to rehab, 100%.

15:54.286 --> 15:56.413
But?

15:56.497 --> 15:59.667
But not this rehab. It's
just not the right path.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.043
There are many different
pathways to sobriety

16:01.126 --> 16:07.549
and many, many different
possible outcomes.

16:07.633 --> 16:08.467
It's not an exact science.

16:08.550 --> 16:10.427
Mom, this isn't science at all.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.388
I did some research. I found
a few places of my own.

16:12.471 --> 16:14.223
(sighs)

16:14.306 --> 16:19.186
Okay, we got Green Rapids,
Whispering Ranch, Clear Meadows.

16:19.269 --> 16:21.021
Well, they all sound
like salad dressing.

16:21.105 --> 16:23.273
Mom, these are
accredited facilities.

16:23.357 --> 16:25.109
They have
impeccable reputations,

16:25.192 --> 16:26.860
they have licensed therapists.

16:26.944 --> 16:29.571
Wouldn't you be more
comfortable...

16:26.944 --> 16:29.571
Yes, I'm sure that I would be.

16:29.655 --> 16:32.116
Okay, fine...

16:29.655 --> 16:32.116
But the point
is to be uncomfortable.

16:32.199 --> 16:34.535
And I believe
that my choice

16:34.618 --> 16:36.245
is gonna push me

16:36.328 --> 16:39.081
right out of my comfort zone
and into real change.

16:39.164 --> 16:41.041
Okay.

16:39.164 --> 16:41.041
And they're not
going to admit me

16:41.125 --> 16:42.418
unless I have you by my side.

16:42.501 --> 16:43.919
Chakra revival.

16:44.002 --> 16:45.295
Sarah, the next session starts
in two days.

16:45.379 --> 16:46.880
Please.

16:46.964 --> 16:47.798
We need to be
on the road by tomorrow.

16:47.881 --> 16:50.926
Mom, any rehab in this pile.

16:51.009 --> 16:52.469
Any one of these,

16:52.553 --> 16:54.304
I will get in the
car right now.

16:54.388 --> 16:58.058
But I-I can't... I'm not
taking you to that other place.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.143
I just don't trust it.

16:59.226 --> 17:02.396
Well, you trust me. Come on.

17:02.479 --> 17:04.815
(whispers):
Mom.

17:23.208 --> 17:25.544
You waiting for Godot
or something?

17:25.627 --> 17:27.463
(both laugh softly)

17:27.546 --> 17:30.424
Spoiler alert,
he's not coming.

17:30.507 --> 17:32.134
I thought I was
the only person

17:32.217 --> 17:32.843
who came out here
to think.

17:32.926 --> 17:34.470
SARAH:
I, um...

17:34.553 --> 17:37.181
I just told Mom I wouldn't
take her to the rehab facility

17:37.264 --> 17:40.768
she wants to go to,
which means she can't go.

17:43.061 --> 17:44.396
Why would you do that?

17:44.480 --> 17:45.814
If you saw this place,
you'd understand.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.524
It's a joke.

17:47.608 --> 17:49.318
I don't want
to set her up for failure.

17:49.401 --> 17:52.654
Look, Mom could get eaten
by a shark tomorrow

17:52.738 --> 17:57.493
and I wouldn't lose any sleep
over it, but I got to ask.

17:57.576 --> 18:00.162
Are you really afraid
of her failing?

18:00.245 --> 18:02.122
Or are you afraid
that she might actually succeed?

18:02.206 --> 18:04.750
What the hell
are you talking about?

18:04.833 --> 18:06.877
You've been picking her up
off the floor all these years.

18:06.960 --> 18:08.086
It's-it's become who you are.
You're-you're in control.

18:08.170 --> 18:09.838
You're a fixer.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.465
But what happens if Mom
doesn't need fixing anymore?

18:11.548 --> 18:15.344
I picked Mom up
because someone had to.

18:15.427 --> 18:16.762
It sure as hell
wasn't gonna be you.

18:16.845 --> 18:17.137
You disappeared.

18:22.434 --> 18:25.646
Is there any chance you could
repeat that trick for us now?

18:34.238 --> 18:35.531

Hi, Auntie Sarah.

18:52.422 --> 18:55.092
Hi, Josh.

18:55.175 --> 18:56.552
Wow,

18:56.635 --> 18:58.554
looks like you started a trend.

18:58.637 --> 18:59.972
I wore my outfit to school again
this morning.

19:00.055 --> 19:02.891
You don't quit, do you, buddy?

19:00.055 --> 19:02.891
Quitting's for quitters.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.768
When Lewis tried to be mean
to me this time,

19:04.852 --> 19:07.688
I told him how bees can fly
up to 15 miles per hour.

19:07.771 --> 19:09.356
And how they
never sleep.

19:09.439 --> 19:10.399
I know the feeling.

19:09.439 --> 19:10.399
So now

19:10.482 --> 19:12.860
Lewis likes bees
even more than me.

19:12.943 --> 19:15.445
And he told everybody
how cool bees are.

19:15.529 --> 19:16.196
Now everyone has
their own bee outfit.

19:18.657 --> 19:20.909
And now look at you,
leader of a whole hive.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.494
Auntie Sarah,

19:22.578 --> 19:26.206
a group of bees
is called a swarm, not a hive.

19:27.457 --> 19:28.292
Thank you, Josh.

19:34.381 --> 19:35.966
GROVER:
There they are.
We pulled out

19:36.049 --> 19:37.593
all the stops
for Bella's last meal.

19:37.676 --> 19:38.844
BELLA:
I'm gonna miss
Sweetie Pie.

19:38.927 --> 19:40.804
GROVER: And Sweetie Pie's
gonna miss you, too.

19:40.888 --> 19:41.722
But don't worry,
we're gonna send plenty

19:41.805 --> 19:43.682
of cupcakes to
Connecticut.

19:43.765 --> 19:45.434
Oh. Have fun at
school, Bella.

19:45.517 --> 19:47.436
I'm sure you're gonna make
a lot of new friends.

19:47.519 --> 19:49.229
I doubt it. I'm coming in
in the middle of the semester.

19:49.313 --> 19:50.981
Everyone there
already knows each other.

19:49.313 --> 19:50.981
Yeah, well,

19:51.064 --> 19:52.024
I'm sure they're gonna
be fighting to know you.

19:52.107 --> 19:53.442
I mean, come on.
The badass rebel

19:53.525 --> 19:54.109
that got deported by
the National Guard?

19:54.192 --> 19:55.319
Instant street cred.

19:55.402 --> 19:57.696
We should eat.
Bella still has packing to do.

19:57.779 --> 19:58.864
Okay.

19:58.947 --> 20:01.825
Let's go, sweetheart.

20:05.704 --> 20:08.123
Okay.

20:08.206 --> 20:09.583
I'll be your sobriety
support person.

20:09.666 --> 20:10.959
I'll drive you to rehab
in the morning.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.628
What made you change your mind?

20:12.711 --> 20:14.421
A swarm of bees.

20:14.504 --> 20:16.882
I'm not gonna stand in
the way of your choice

20:16.965 --> 20:19.635
just because it isn't the one
I would make.

20:19.718 --> 20:22.137
Thank you. Thank you.

20:23.931 --> 20:25.349
Yes!

20:25.432 --> 20:28.060
That's what I'm talking about.

20:28.143 --> 20:29.645
(exhales)

20:29.728 --> 20:31.063
Thanks again
for coming over, man.

20:31.146 --> 20:35.651
Especially after I was...
kind of a dick the other night.

20:35.734 --> 20:37.152
It's all good.

20:37.235 --> 20:38.820
Yeah, I really needed
this after the last

20:38.904 --> 20:40.614
couple of days I had.

20:40.697 --> 20:42.824
Mm. What'd you do?

20:42.908 --> 20:46.578
Nothing, but that didn't stop
Corinne from biting my head off.

20:46.662 --> 20:48.163
Man, you probably deserved it.

20:48.246 --> 20:49.831
Okay, look,

20:49.915 --> 20:51.833
I get what I did
back then was wrong,

20:51.917 --> 20:54.336
but she's-she's married.

20:54.419 --> 20:55.379
She's a mom. I just...

20:55.462 --> 20:58.215
I figured
she was over it by now.

20:58.298 --> 21:00.175
Over it?

21:02.344 --> 21:04.012
(stammers)

21:04.096 --> 21:05.847
Do you have any idea
what you put that girl through?

21:05.931 --> 21:08.475
After you
disappeared,

21:08.558 --> 21:13.188
she didn't eat, didn't sleep,
wouldn't talk to anyone.

21:13.271 --> 21:15.691
We weren't sure
that she'd ever get over it.

21:15.774 --> 21:17.484
I don't know what was
going through your head

21:17.567 --> 21:20.278
when you took off, and I'm sure
you had your reasons,

21:20.362 --> 21:22.447
but I've never seen anything

21:22.531 --> 21:24.533
like what you put
Corinne through.

21:24.616 --> 21:29.454
So, like I said, if she tried
to rip your head off,

21:29.538 --> 21:30.414
you probably deserved it.

21:35.502 --> 21:37.462
(indistinct chatter)

21:41.508 --> 21:42.467
Hi!

21:42.551 --> 21:44.261
Has it been like this
all day?

21:44.344 --> 21:45.929
Yeah.

21:46.013 --> 21:47.222
This is great.
We're gonna sell out in no time.

21:47.305 --> 21:48.307
Sarah.

21:47.305 --> 21:48.307
Hi!

21:48.390 --> 21:50.058
Hi, Diego.

21:48.390 --> 21:50.058
Sarah.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.935
Yeah.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.935
They're not here
to buy Greylock money.

21:52.019 --> 21:53.812
They're here to take
their American money out.

21:52.019 --> 21:53.812
What?

21:53.895 --> 21:54.563
Everyone's worried
about losing their money

21:54.646 --> 21:56.023
if our currency fails

21:56.106 --> 21:57.899
and if Greylock's economy tanks.

21:57.983 --> 22:00.360
No, for this to work,
everyone needs to buy in.

22:00.444 --> 22:01.111
If they're pulling
their money out,

22:01.194 --> 22:03.989
our economy's doomed.

22:04.072 --> 22:06.074
So is Greylock.

22:09.036 --> 22:11.997
This new currency is a solution
to all of our problems.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.582
Why didn't people buy in?
What are they afraid of?

22:13.665 --> 22:15.083
CORINNE:
It's a big change, Sarah.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.585
Money is life.
It puts food on the table.

22:16.668 --> 22:18.211
It keeps a roof
over your head.

22:18.295 --> 22:19.755
And for the folks
in this town,

22:19.838 --> 22:21.048
it's green and it has
U.S. presidents on it.

22:21.131 --> 22:23.508
I mean, giving that up
to invest in something so new

22:23.592 --> 22:24.926
and so unproven is...

22:25.010 --> 22:26.303
Scary.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.303
Not as scary
as what's

22:26.386 --> 22:27.220
gonna happen to Greylock
if they don't get on board.

22:27.304 --> 22:29.014
I need
to reframe

22:29.097 --> 22:30.432
the conversation,

22:30.515 --> 22:32.267
help people
get over their fears.

22:32.350 --> 22:34.144
I'm gonna host...

22:34.227 --> 22:36.313
an open meeting
tomorrow morning at town hall.

22:36.396 --> 22:38.440
No, you're not.

22:36.396 --> 22:38.440
You're taking your mom
to rehab in the morning.

22:38.523 --> 22:40.150
No, guys, this is a crisis.

22:38.523 --> 22:40.150
AJ:
That we can handle

22:40.233 --> 22:41.193
until you get back.

22:40.233 --> 22:41.193
It's a
three-day trip.

22:41.276 --> 22:42.736
I can't be gone that long.

22:42.819 --> 22:44.404
What kind of a leader
does that make me?

22:44.488 --> 22:45.697
Type of leader that shows up
for their family.

22:45.781 --> 22:47.115
And the kind that has friends
she can trust

22:47.199 --> 22:48.533
to step up for her.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.533
I do trust you guys,

22:48.617 --> 22:49.701
but I-I think
I have to be here for this.

22:49.785 --> 22:50.911
No.
No.

22:49.785 --> 22:50.911
No.

22:50.994 --> 22:52.287
What if I call the rehab place?

22:52.370 --> 22:53.622
Maybe they can make
an exception.

22:52.370 --> 22:53.622
OTHERS: No!

22:53.705 --> 22:54.790
Nice try.

22:53.705 --> 22:54.790
This crisis

22:54.873 --> 22:55.791
could be
an extinction-level event

22:55.874 --> 22:57.501
for Greylock's economy.

22:55.874 --> 22:57.501
And your mom

22:57.584 --> 22:59.211
missing the check-in
window could be

22:59.294 --> 23:00.295
an extinction-level
event for her sobriety.

23:00.378 --> 23:01.463
Yeah, it's
a hard decision,

23:01.546 --> 23:02.214
which is why
we made it for you.

23:02.297 --> 23:04.132
GROVER:
Sarah,

23:04.216 --> 23:05.675
we got you.

23:07.677 --> 23:11.306
That dinner was like a two-hour
customer service call.

23:11.389 --> 23:13.934
(chuckles) My dad
always defaults to bank talk

23:14.017 --> 23:15.477
when he gets anxious.

23:15.560 --> 23:18.105
TYLER:
On the plus side, I learned
a lot about index funds.

23:18.188 --> 23:19.898
(chuckles softly)

23:19.981 --> 23:22.400
Tomorrow night
will be just you and me.

23:22.484 --> 23:23.568
I promise it won't be boring.

23:23.652 --> 23:25.487
You still want to go
to Phoebe's party?

23:25.570 --> 23:27.239
Her parents are out of town.

23:27.322 --> 23:28.698
Sounds like the whole school's
going to show up.

23:28.782 --> 23:29.282
Hey, I'm gonna have
to call you back.

23:29.366 --> 23:31.535
Okay, bye.

23:31.618 --> 23:33.078
Sorry to interrupt.

23:33.161 --> 23:34.788
I know that you and Tyler
want to make the most

23:34.871 --> 23:36.331
of every minute before you go.

23:36.414 --> 23:37.749
Have you guys talked
about how things will change

23:37.833 --> 23:38.959
when you get
to school?

23:39.042 --> 23:40.877
Who says things have to change?

23:41.586 --> 23:43.380
I just think...

23:44.714 --> 23:46.550
...it might be hard to live
two lives at once.

23:46.633 --> 23:50.512
♪ It's been
seven solid days... ♪

23:50.595 --> 23:53.223
My school's in Connecticut
and my boyfriend's here.

23:54.808 --> 23:57.144
That's not two lives, Alexis.
It's two towns.

23:57.227 --> 23:58.854
Bella, you trying
to convince me

23:58.937 --> 24:01.690
or yourself?

24:01.773 --> 24:06.778
♪ I just want to know
you're unimpaired... ♪

24:06.862 --> 24:08.155
ELLEN:
Still no reception?

24:08.238 --> 24:09.739
SARAH:
Nothing.

24:09.823 --> 24:11.825
I have no way to know
how Greylock is doing.

24:11.908 --> 24:14.619
Can't even send a text.

24:11.908 --> 24:14.619
(chuckling)

24:14.703 --> 24:16.163
I fail to see what's so funny.

24:16.246 --> 24:17.205
I'm just remembering
that papier-mâché

24:17.289 --> 24:19.875
volcano you made in sixth grade.

24:19.958 --> 24:21.543
And how the night before
you turned it in, it collapsed.

24:21.626 --> 24:24.588
If you're about to draw
some ham-fisted parallel

24:24.671 --> 24:26.882
between the collapse
of my country's economy

24:26.965 --> 24:30.886
and a science fair volcano,
I swear to God I will push you

24:30.969 --> 24:33.054
into traffic.

24:30.969 --> 24:33.054
Don't you remember what
happened after it collapsed?

24:33.138 --> 24:34.806
Mm-mm.

24:33.138 --> 24:34.806
Corinne, she came over.

24:34.890 --> 24:37.142
She spent all night
helping you build a new one.

24:37.225 --> 24:39.352
And then there was
the time when AJ,

24:39.436 --> 24:43.190
she drove your laptop
to Dartmouth

24:43.273 --> 24:45.108
because you forgot it
during Christmas break.

24:45.192 --> 24:47.235
And then I think Grover
cooked dinner for your

24:47.319 --> 24:50.238
entire field hockey team...

24:50.322 --> 24:51.615
before you left
for state finals.

24:51.698 --> 24:54.743
Yeah, I'm not great
at letting go.

24:54.826 --> 24:56.870
No kidding.

24:56.953 --> 24:58.705
But if you have to,

24:58.788 --> 25:00.457
you could do a whole lot worse
than handing

25:00.540 --> 25:01.875
the wheel over to your friends.

25:05.712 --> 25:07.589
AJ:
This is a dumpster fire.

25:07.672 --> 25:09.716
We've been sitting here
for seven hours and we still

25:09.799 --> 25:11.259
have no clue how to get people
to buy into the money.

25:11.343 --> 25:14.262
There are some good
ideas up there.
Corinne,

25:14.346 --> 25:16.598
"call Lin-Manuel Miranda"
is not a good idea.

25:14.346 --> 25:16.598
Of course it's a good idea.

25:16.681 --> 25:19.017
I was in the room
where it happened.

25:16.681 --> 25:19.017
What about

25:19.100 --> 25:20.602
incentives? Everybody
likes free stuff.

25:20.685 --> 25:21.937
Ooh, my gym gave
me a free toaster

25:22.020 --> 25:23.438
when I bought
a membership.

25:23.521 --> 25:24.856
Where are we supposed
to find 2,000 toasters?

25:24.940 --> 25:26.942
It doesn't have
to be actual toasters.

25:27.025 --> 25:29.778
Air fryer on the
other hand. Right?

25:27.025 --> 25:29.778
Oh, I need an air fryer.

25:29.861 --> 25:31.613
