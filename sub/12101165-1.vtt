00:04.004 --> 00:06.675
Doctor. Phil McCombs,
<i>Washington Post.</i>

00:06.708 --> 00:07.709
Thank you. Good to see you.

00:07.742 --> 00:09.444
Thank you
for taking the time.

00:18.687 --> 00:22.590
So, when you take them out,
you don't see anything?

00:24.892 --> 00:26.160
No, you don't see anything.

00:28.396 --> 00:32.032
I-I-I mean, of all the thousands
of second trimester abortions

00:32.066 --> 00:35.169
that I've done, I mean,
maybe I've seen half a dozen.

00:37.339 --> 00:38.773
But didn't it bother you
when you did?

00:40.408 --> 00:41.676
No, not particularly.

00:41.710 --> 00:42.744
It was the end product;

00:42.777 --> 00:44.746
a lifeless,
limp thing lying there.

00:44.779 --> 00:46.514
They have a human form.

00:47.915 --> 00:48.916
Oh, absolutely.

00:52.420 --> 00:56.056
I-I-I'm sorry.
I-I'm a little bit confused.

00:56.090 --> 00:58.859
Uh.

00:58.892 --> 01:02.664
First you said,
"All you see is bloody meat."

01:02.697 --> 01:03.531
Hm-mm.

01:05.232 --> 01:08.202
But now you're saying
you always knew it was a person.

01:09.404 --> 01:10.372
So Doctor,

01:12.607 --> 01:13.742
which one is it?

01:19.246 --> 01:20.914
<i>I didn't know what to say.</i>

01:20.948 --> 01:23.016
<i>I felt I was caught in a lie.</i>

01:23.050 --> 01:25.687
<i>So, you have to understand,
it was the '70s.</i>

01:25.720 --> 01:29.056
<i>The women's liberation
movement was exploding.</i>

01:29.089 --> 01:32.126
<i>Millions of women
were taking to the streets,</i>

01:32.159 --> 01:33.628
<i>and I got swept up in the way.</i>

01:33.661 --> 01:35.262
<i>saying now
that anything after eight weeks</i>

01:35.295 --> 01:37.131
<i>is murder, which I'm all for.</i>

01:37.164 --> 01:39.099
<i>I'm protesting the protesters.</i>

01:53.515 --> 01:56.818
<i>Proverbs 14:12.</i>

01:56.851 --> 02:00.422
<i>"There is a way
that seems right unto man,</i>

02:00.455 --> 02:04.626
<i>but in the end thereof,
the way is death."</i>

02:06.795 --> 02:08.430
<i>Well, sir,
I was in the parking lot</i>

02:08.463 --> 02:09.831
<i>and I saw some people's signs
and I said,</i>

02:09.864 --> 02:11.265
<i>"What's happening today?"
And they said,</i>

02:11.298 --> 02:14.101
<i>"They're protesting
the governor's decision."</i>

02:14.134 --> 02:16.136
<i>I don't want
a bunch of old white dudes</i>

02:16.170 --> 02:17.505
<i>regulating my body.</i>

02:19.206 --> 02:20.442
<i>I want us to stand up</i>

02:20.475 --> 02:22.075
<i>for the innocent lives
of children</i>

02:22.109 --> 02:24.077
<i>that are being aborted
in the womb,</i>

02:24.111 --> 02:27.114
<i>and to stop the bloodshed.</i>

02:32.052 --> 02:34.789
<i>I mean, in proportion,
12-year-olds can get abortions</i>

02:34.823 --> 02:36.791
<i>in public schools
and without parental consent.</i>

02:36.825 --> 02:37.859
<i>That's happened in the States.</i>

02:37.892 --> 02:39.594
<i>In Virginia,
if you have a baby,</i>

02:39.627 --> 02:41.094
<i>they put it on a table
and they ask the parents</i>

02:41.128 --> 02:42.363
<i>do you want it to live a lie.</i>

03:01.716 --> 03:03.283
My life.

03:03.318 --> 03:04.853
my decision!

03:04.886 --> 03:06.621
My life.

03:06.654 --> 03:09.524
my decision!

03:24.739 --> 03:28.977
You have to sacrifice your pawn
to save your queen.

03:29.009 --> 03:30.578
<i>It all started in my 20s.</i>

03:30.612 --> 03:32.212
<i>That's Ruth, my first love.</i>

03:32.246 --> 03:33.815
<i>See, my family was Jewish</i>

03:33.848 --> 03:36.049
<i>so I tried to get them to
warm up to her.</i>

03:36.083 --> 03:38.252
<i>But I had a better chance
of beating my dad at chess.</i>

03:38.285 --> 03:40.087
Check.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.789
Pawns are the soul of a game.

04:00.308 --> 04:03.344
You don't need the queen
to win the game.

04:06.213 --> 04:07.214
Checkmate.

04:08.716 --> 04:11.285
You have to sacrifice
for the greater good.

04:19.761 --> 04:21.629
How could I
have been so stupid.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.198
Maybe we can get married.

04:25.232 --> 04:30.805
No. Not like this. Not yet.

04:30.838 --> 04:32.640
You do know
I love you, right?

04:32.674 --> 04:34.842
I can't take care
of a baby right now.

04:39.179 --> 04:41.649
Oh, that's what you want.

04:41.683 --> 04:43.150
I can't tell
my family about this.

04:43.183 --> 04:44.519
My father won't help.

04:46.253 --> 04:50.123
What am I going to do,
Bernie?

04:50.157 --> 04:52.694
Honey, it's we, and we're
in this together, okay?

04:54.495 --> 04:56.196
Okay.

05:12.647 --> 05:13.915
<i>I would have married her,</i>

05:13.948 --> 05:15.817
<i>but she didn't want that.</i>

05:15.850 --> 05:18.620
<i>So, I gave her $500.
That way, nobody had to know.</i>

05:20.220 --> 05:21.956
<i>I never thought
I would lose Ruth.</i>

05:26.060 --> 05:27.695
<i>I became a doctor</i>

05:27.729 --> 05:30.832
<i>to make sure no girl ever
had to go through that again.</i>

05:30.865 --> 05:34.602
I will give no deadly medicine,
nor suggest any such counsel;

05:34.636 --> 05:38.306
nor give to a woman a pessary
to procure an abortion.

05:38.339 --> 05:39.807
<i>Like most doctors,</i>

05:39.841 --> 05:42.142
<i>I would violate
the Hippocratic oath.</i>

05:42.175 --> 05:45.212
<i>But saving women
was all that mattered.</i>

05:45.245 --> 05:47.715
<i>I know everyone has
their own version of events.</i>

05:47.749 --> 05:49.017
<i>But if you really want to know</i>

05:49.050 --> 05:51.284
<i>how abortion became legal
in our country,</i>

05:51.319 --> 05:53.186
<i>I will tell you the true story</i>

05:53.220 --> 05:54.322
<i>of Roe v. Wade.</i>

06:00.528 --> 06:03.531
<i>I wanted to get abortion
legalized across the country.</i>

06:03.564 --> 06:05.165
<i>Our master plan to do that</i>

06:05.198 --> 06:08.168
<i>started right here
in New York City.</i>

06:08.201 --> 06:09.570
<i>That's Betty Friedan,</i>

06:09.604 --> 06:11.305
<i>the leader of
the women's movement.</i>

06:11.339 --> 06:14.442
<i>You see, we needed her gals
if we had any chance of winning.</i>

06:16.377 --> 06:19.147
Ah-ha. Not again.
Mrs. Friedan.

06:19.179 --> 06:22.016
The Plaza's Oak Room
has a 61-year tradition

06:22.050 --> 06:25.019
of men's only lunches.

06:35.096 --> 06:36.898
Well, well, well.

06:36.931 --> 06:39.767
If it isn't the world-famous
author of <i>The Feminine Mystique,</i>

06:39.801 --> 06:41.769
Mrs. Betty Friedan.

06:41.803 --> 06:43.504
Mr. Larry Lader.

06:43.538 --> 06:45.205
<i>Larry was my best friend.</i>

06:45.238 --> 06:48.176
<i>He was the father
of the abortion movement.</i>

06:48.208 --> 06:50.344
<i>And he was also mentored
by Margaret Sanger,</i>

06:50.378 --> 06:52.413
<i>the founder of
Planned Parenthood.</i>

06:52.447 --> 06:53.948
<i>Now, here's the ugly truth.</i>

06:53.981 --> 06:56.617
<i>Margaret opened clinics
in poor Black neighborhoods</i>

06:56.651 --> 06:59.587
<i>and called it the Negro Project.</i>

06:59.620 --> 07:04.125
The mass of Negroes,
particularly in the South,

07:04.158 --> 07:08.429
still breed carelessly
and disastrously.

07:10.297 --> 07:14.068
The result that the increase
among Negroes,

07:14.102 --> 07:16.637
more than among whites,

07:16.671 --> 07:19.272
is that portion
of the population

07:19.307 --> 07:22.577
least intelligent and fit.

07:22.610 --> 07:23.911
<i>Her goal was to reduce</i>

07:23.945 --> 07:25.613
<i>the Black population,</i>

07:25.646 --> 07:28.116
<i>either through birth control
or sterilization.</i>

07:28.149 --> 07:30.283
<i>She literally wanted to stop
Black people</i>

07:30.318 --> 07:32.587
<i>from having babies altogether.</i>

07:32.620 --> 07:35.656
<i>And Larry continued her work
by launching an organization</i>

07:35.690 --> 07:37.458
<i>to legalize abortion,</i>

07:37.492 --> 07:40.228
<i>and wrote the first nationwide
book on the topic.</i>

07:40.260 --> 07:41.596
Have you happened
to read my book?

07:41.629 --> 07:42.764
Did you prance over here

07:42.797 --> 07:46.067
to have me fawn over
your vanity project?

07:46.100 --> 07:48.770
Cyril here works for the ACLU.

07:48.803 --> 07:50.738
We can have him sue the Plaza
if you like.

07:50.772 --> 07:52.106
A girl should
not expect special privileges

07:52.140 --> 07:53.841
because of her sex,

07:53.875 --> 07:56.010
but neither should she adjust
to prejudice or discrimination.

07:56.043 --> 07:57.979
I-I'm Bernard.

07:59.213 --> 08:00.314
An obstetrician officially,

08:00.348 --> 08:03.151
until they get the laws
repealed.

08:03.184 --> 08:06.120
Cyril is also
the lead counsel

08:06.154 --> 08:08.489
for Planned Parenthood.

08:08.523 --> 08:11.993
So, why are you boys
so worked up about abortion?

08:12.026 --> 08:14.796
Well,
Cyril is gonna head legal,

08:14.829 --> 08:16.130
Bernie, medical.

08:16.164 --> 08:17.932
I would like him
to open up a clinic.

08:17.965 --> 08:19.634
Larry, listen,
I've told you a million times.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.669
I'm not gonna ruin
my reputation over this.

08:21.702 --> 08:24.172
The women need your help.

08:24.205 --> 08:25.606
Opening a clinic
will land him in hot water

08:25.640 --> 08:27.008
like Vuitch.

08:27.041 --> 08:28.776
Exactly. And I'm
much better to you out of jail.

08:28.810 --> 08:30.144
A bunch of disorganized men

08:30.178 --> 08:32.380
are gonna rid this country
of abortion restriction?

08:32.413 --> 08:33.948
No, no, no.
We're not disorganized, okay.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.216
- If Bernie...
- We're looking for

08:35.249 --> 08:36.818
a pregnant girl to
challenge the abortion laws.

08:36.851 --> 08:39.453
If New York falls,
the country falls.

08:39.487 --> 08:41.389
If that doesn't work,
we'll lobby the legislature.

08:41.422 --> 08:43.024
I guess I can provide
medical research

08:43.057 --> 08:44.525
to prove our opinion.

08:44.559 --> 08:46.460
We wanna rally
behind the women's movement

08:46.494 --> 08:48.663
to get the TV media on board.

08:48.696 --> 08:50.531
So that's why you need me.

08:50.565 --> 08:52.800
We need to continue
Margaret Sanger's work.

08:52.834 --> 08:54.235
Oh, well.

08:54.268 --> 08:56.504
Thank you so much
for this explanation.

08:56.537 --> 08:58.739
But abortion
is really not our focus.

09:00.775 --> 09:02.043
You're gonna regret it

09:02.076 --> 09:04.011
when you see Gloria Steinem
and Bella Abzug

09:04.045 --> 09:07.048
hopping on board
and everybody else.

09:07.081 --> 09:08.317
You're our first choice.

09:08.349 --> 09:09.417
Yeah? Why?

09:09.450 --> 09:10.785
Because you're the best.

09:14.622 --> 09:15.690
<i>Betty came on board</i>

09:15.723 --> 09:17.658
<i>and brought
her core of feminists.</i>

09:17.692 --> 09:19.694
<i>We all launched NARAL together,</i>

09:19.727 --> 09:22.029
<i>the National Association
to Repeal Abortion Laws.</i>

09:26.601 --> 09:28.002
Did I tell you?

09:28.035 --> 09:29.036
Did I tell you?

09:32.540 --> 09:35.276
Looks like I started
a revolution.

09:35.310 --> 09:38.512
I mean... I told you,
you should open a clinic.

09:38.546 --> 09:40.882
Well, you know, you're probably
right about the clinic.

09:40.915 --> 09:44.353
But listen, I-I gotta
look after Adele and Joey, so.

09:46.487 --> 09:47.889
Are you not seeing this?

09:49.223 --> 09:50.625
Yeah, but do you really think

09:50.658 --> 09:52.693
we should go for full repeal?

09:52.727 --> 09:56.230
I say we go for
abortion on demand!

09:58.766 --> 09:59.667
Yeah.

10:03.471 --> 10:05.439
Listen, come on.
We don't need to get greedy.

10:05.473 --> 10:09.877
Can't we just do this for health
or if a woman gets raped?

10:09.911 --> 10:11.212
You know, wouldn't it
just be better for that?

10:11.245 --> 10:14.115
We don't need to go for
abortion on demand.

10:14.148 --> 10:15.249
No, no, no.

10:15.283 --> 10:17.785
We have to go
for the full enchilada.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.553
Otherwise, we'll get nothing.

10:19.587 --> 10:20.855
Cyril's correct.

10:22.523 --> 10:25.459
We can't turn a woman's body
into a business negotiation.

10:31.532 --> 10:34.101
<i>You just won
a fabulous trip to London.</i>

10:34.135 --> 10:38.439
<i>It's worth over $1,000.
Congratulations, sir.</i>

10:41.609 --> 10:43.511
Your dinner's in the oven,
if you wanna heat it up.

10:45.146 --> 10:46.247
Thank you, sweetheart.

10:46.280 --> 10:48.350
Like always!

10:48.383 --> 10:50.785
Oh, come on, not again.

10:50.818 --> 10:52.186
Eighteen-hour days?

10:53.854 --> 10:55.489
What's her name?

10:55.523 --> 10:58.092
Betty Friedan.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.827
Come on, you can't take a joke?

10:59.860 --> 11:02.630
What you do isn't funny.

11:02.663 --> 11:05.599
I don't understand. A woman
doesn't support women's rights?

11:05.633 --> 11:07.336
I mean, you should see
what they go through.

11:07.369 --> 11:08.803
Then go be with them.

11:08.836 --> 11:10.871
Women are dying.
I'm saving lives.

11:20.214 --> 11:23.017
I just miss you, that's all.

11:29.023 --> 11:31.692
Okay, you win.

11:31.726 --> 11:33.894
<i>The New York State Senate
today passed one of the nation's</i>

11:33.928 --> 11:36.398
<i>most sweeping
abortion control bills.</i>

11:36.431 --> 11:38.199
<i>Aggregates
and enemies of the bill</i>

11:38.232 --> 11:40.534
<i>brought tremendous pressures
to bear on legislators</i>

11:40.568 --> 11:42.337
<i>on the emotional issue,</i>

11:42.371 --> 11:44.406
<i>and the drama was summed up
late yesterday</i>

11:44.439 --> 11:45.673
<i>in the State Assembly</i>

11:45.706 --> 11:47.808
<i>when one man's vote
made the difference.</i>

11:47.842 --> 11:49.977
<i>As New York's Assembly
passed a bill</i>

11:50.011 --> 11:52.481
<i>legalizing abortions
for any reason,</i>

11:52.513 --> 11:55.750
<i>up to the 24th week
of a pregnancy,</i>

11:55.783 --> 11:59.520
<i>the decision to be made between
a woman and her physician.</i>

11:59.553 --> 12:02.056
<i>But then it became apparent

12:02.089 --> 12:04.493
<i>unless one vote was changed.</i>

12:04.525 --> 12:06.761
<i>But I cannot,

<i>read the Diary of the Unborn.</i>

12:26.481 --> 12:27.782
<i>"My parents don't know it yet,</i>

12:27.815 --> 12:33.321
<i>"I'm as small
as the seed of an apple.</i>

12:35.623 --> 12:37.325
<i>"But it's me already.</i>

12:39.428 --> 12:40.828
<i>"I'm to be a girl.</i>

12:42.563 --> 12:44.799
<i>"I shall have blonde hair
and blue eyes.</i>

12:49.136 --> 12:50.738
<i>"October 19th.</i>

12:53.674 --> 12:57.144
<i>"Some say
I'm not a real person yet,</i>

12:57.178 --> 12:59.448
<i>"that only my mother exists.</i>

13:01.349 --> 13:04.085
<i>"But I am a real person.</i>

13:11.359 --> 13:12.693
<i>"December 13th.</i>

13:16.597 --> 13:20.167
<i>"I'm just about able to see.</i>

13:20.201 --> 13:22.870
<i>"It's-it's dark around me.</i>

13:26.841 --> 13:28.543
<i>"But what I want
more than anything.</i>

13:32.514 --> 13:35.149
<i>"is to see my mommy.</i>

13:40.821 --> 13:42.022
<i>"December 24th.</i>

13:47.228 --> 13:50.698
<i>"I wonder if mommy.</i>

13:53.834 --> 13:57.238
<i>"hears the whispering
of my heart.</i>

14:00.241 --> 14:04.044
<i>"It beats so evenly.</i>

14:11.852 --> 14:16.558
<i>"October 28th... December 28th.</i>

14:25.866 --> 14:27.234
<i>Today my mommy killed me."</i>

14:36.411 --> 14:38.812
<i>The win shocked our opposition.</i>

14:38.846 --> 14:40.080
<i>I mean, no one thought
we would get abortion</i>

14:40.114 --> 14:42.716
<i>legalized in New York.</i>

14:42.750 --> 14:45.620
<i>Especially since the Catholics
controlled everything there.</i>

14:49.357 --> 14:51.426
How does Rockefeller
appoint Cyril Means

14:51.459 --> 14:52.893
to head this committee?

14:52.927 --> 14:54.329
It's a conflict of interest.

14:54.362 --> 14:56.431
He works for Planned Parenthood.

14:56.464 --> 14:58.667
Politicians
are now playing God,

14:58.699 --> 15:02.537
deciding on who has the right
to live and to die.

15:02.571 --> 15:06.240
This is Dr. Mildred Jefferson,
she is the first,

15:06.273 --> 15:09.076
uh, woman to graduate...

15:09.109 --> 15:11.078
What he's trying to say is

15:11.111 --> 15:15.015
I am the first Negro woman
to graduate Harvard Medical.

15:15.049 --> 15:17.718
Ellen,
I run a pro-life women's group.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.554
We, ah, tried to fight this
in Albany.

15:20.821 --> 15:22.457
Feminism is destructive.

15:22.490 --> 15:24.058
I have no philosophical

15:24.091 --> 15:27.429
or intellectual
appreciation for it.

15:27.462 --> 15:28.630
Oh, we're not feminists.

15:28.663 --> 15:30.699
And they used to be
against abortion.

15:30.731 --> 15:32.601
It's not about
women's rights either.

15:32.634 --> 15:33.968
Would you like to head up

15:34.001 --> 15:36.804
a right to life group
that I'm starting?

15:36.837 --> 15:39.139
I could write a few letters.

15:39.173 --> 15:40.508
There's more
that needs to be done.

15:42.009 --> 15:43.445
I could attend some rallies.

15:43.478 --> 15:46.715
Really? That's it?

15:46.747 --> 15:49.551
This will be the National
Right to Life Committee.

15:49.584 --> 15:52.253
Father, I am
still completing my residency

15:52.286 --> 15:54.154
at Boston University.

15:54.188 --> 15:57.091
I will not give them
any more excuses.

15:57.124 --> 15:59.260
I never heard
Rosa Parks give excuses.

16:45.873 --> 16:48.510
I'm sorry about Ellen,
all right.

16:48.543 --> 16:49.977
She's from Long Island.

16:50.010 --> 16:51.945
I will not be used
for the color of my skin.

16:51.979 --> 16:54.482
I do what I do on principle,
like Don Quixote.

16:58.520 --> 17:01.489
Look, first they came
after the Jews,

17:01.523 --> 17:05.327
but we weren't Jewish,
so we didn't say anything.

17:05.360 --> 17:08.496
And then they came
after the mentally deficient.

17:08.530 --> 17:12.966
But we weren't deficient
so we did nothing.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.602
And now they're comin'
after the unborn.

17:18.005 --> 17:20.608
and so you're gonna do nothing?

17:24.546 --> 17:27.214
That's a low blow.

17:27.247 --> 17:29.116
No one is coming for the unborn.

17:31.852 --> 17:35.724
This is akin to slavery,
and you know the topic.

17:37.726 --> 17:39.093
Because I'm Black?

17:41.261 --> 17:42.530
Yes.

17:46.133 --> 17:48.035
This can't come to you
as a shock.

17:48.068 --> 17:49.337
Dr. Haven,

17:49.371 --> 17:50.839
perhaps the board
could consider...

17:50.871 --> 17:52.607
The decision has been made.

17:52.640 --> 17:55.510
I've been in medicine
for 20 years.

17:55.543 --> 17:59.046
Dr. McConnell will be
our new chief resident,

17:59.079 --> 18:00.448
and that's final.

18:00.482 --> 18:03.852
You've chosen Dr. McConnell.

18:03.884 --> 18:06.220
The man can barely get
through an appendectomy.

18:06.253 --> 18:08.088
He's a fine doctor.

18:08.122 --> 18:10.792
This position
is way too precious

18:10.825 --> 18:13.595
to be wasted on a woman.

18:18.132 --> 18:19.900
I'll get it.

18:24.004 --> 18:26.073
Professor Robert Byrn.

18:26.106 --> 18:28.410
Father McHugh
said you were gonna call.

18:30.110 --> 18:31.145
There is not much time,

18:31.178 --> 18:33.882
and Jim said
you wanted to help out.

18:33.914 --> 18:35.717
Well, supposedly

18:35.750 --> 18:38.285
you're the best
constitutional mind he knows.

18:38.319 --> 18:39.587
The only one he knows.

18:41.823 --> 18:44.759
"Any society that's willing to
give up a little liberty

18:44.793 --> 18:46.994
to gain a little security

18:47.027 --> 18:49.464
will deserve neither
and lose both."

18:49.497 --> 18:51.499
Benjamin Franklin.

18:51.533 --> 18:55.102
Susan B. Anthony
said about abortion,

18:55.135 --> 18:58.105
"Awful guilty is the woman
who commits the deed."

18:58.138 --> 19:00.508
No one will be passing a law
to kill the unborn.

19:00.542 --> 19:03.277
Our foundations
are built on natural law.

19:03.311 --> 19:04.479
Are you sure about that?

19:05.946 --> 19:08.349
People can't humanize
what they can't see.

19:08.383 --> 19:10.685
Physicians need to
balance the discussion.

19:12.654 --> 19:15.423
But in order to win,

19:15.457 --> 19:17.659
we need to take God
out of the argument.

19:17.692 --> 19:19.427
Nathanson's clinics
are performing

19:19.461 --> 19:21.463
a thousand abortions per week.

19:21.496 --> 19:22.797
Nathanson?

19:22.831 --> 19:25.165
Dr. Bernard Nathanson,
the obstetrician.

19:25.199 --> 19:27.134
The self-proclaimed
savior of women.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.269
Sounds more like
an abortionist than a doctor.

19:29.304 --> 19:31.339
The Abortion King,
they call him.

19:31.372 --> 19:34.442
That's why I'm sacrificing
my time and taking up the fight.

19:34.476 --> 19:39.146
I'm a woman.
You have choices.

19:39.179 --> 19:41.114
I understand.

19:41.148 --> 19:43.016
You need to take care
of your children.

19:43.050 --> 19:46.153
No, we don't have any children.

19:51.058 --> 19:53.026
We tried.

20:03.237 --> 20:04.405
So glad you're here.

20:04.439 --> 20:06.841
Look at this.
Have you seen that?

20:08.443 --> 20:11.679
"An unmarried
Catholic law professor."

20:11.713 --> 20:12.747
<i>Now, Larry's strategy</i>

20:12.780 --> 20:15.249
<i>was to always
vilify the Catholics.</i>

20:15.282 --> 20:17.184
<i>So, every time
we leaked a story,</i>

20:17.217 --> 20:20.153
<i>we made sure the writer
identified the bad guys</i>

20:20.187 --> 20:22.390
<i>specifically as Catholics.</i>

20:22.423 --> 20:24.091
I'm always described that way.

20:24.124 --> 20:26.494
You never see them identify
Betty Friedan "a married Jew,"

20:26.528 --> 20:28.363
but us, always "a Catholic."

20:29.898 --> 20:31.231
Could be worse.

20:33.066 --> 20:34.268
Come on.

20:34.302 --> 20:36.236
We're gonna go in here
and over to the left.

20:56.123 --> 20:57.257
Where are the graves?

20:59.928 --> 21:01.829
Where are the names
carved in stone?

21:04.599 --> 21:06.935
Where do we go to pray?

21:06.968 --> 21:08.135
I don't know, Father.

21:08.168 --> 21:09.804
But I do know
that they will never stop

21:09.837 --> 21:12.307
the religious persecution.

21:12.340 --> 21:14.742
Preaching on Sundays
isn't saving babies.

21:17.512 --> 21:19.714
"The fate of unborn millions
will now depend,

21:19.747 --> 21:22.050
under God,
on the courage of this army."

21:22.082 --> 21:23.318
George Washington.

21:24.786 --> 21:26.921
We need to take God
out of the argument.

21:26.955 --> 21:28.990
Your father was a minister.

21:29.023 --> 21:30.157
Yes.

21:33.828 --> 21:35.763
Life begins at conception.

21:36.998 --> 21:39.367
As a physician, I know this.

21:40.868 --> 21:42.269
And so does the Scraper.

21:45.840 --> 21:48.009
The Scraper?

21:48.042 --> 21:49.777
That's what they call
Dr. Nathanson.

21:56.818 --> 21:57.852
I'm in.

22:04.659 --> 22:07.160
I'll have someone
from the Right to Life office

22:07.194 --> 22:09.296
get it up and running
until you can take over.

22:10.498 --> 22:11.666
God bless you.

22:17.005 --> 22:18.673
You know,
it's cheaper to abort a baby

22:18.706 --> 22:20.675
than it is
to keep it on welfare.

22:23.143 --> 22:24.846
Now that it's in the courts,

22:24.879 --> 22:27.382
the interests of the baby will
be taken into consideration.

22:29.484 --> 22:31.686
And now that it is legal
in New York,

22:31.719 --> 22:34.389
Larry really wants me
to open up a clinic.

22:34.422 --> 22:36.256
Does he want to pay
our mortgage?

22:48.036 --> 22:49.236
<i>Larry was right,</i>

22:49.269 --> 22:51.005
<i>and from this point forward,</i>

22:51.039 --> 22:54.342
<i>we were able to carry out
over 70,000 abortions</i>

22:54.375 --> 22:58.846
<i>throughout my career,
making over $20 million.</i>

23:01.683 --> 23:04.686
Maybe this is
worth your reputation.

23:08.288 --> 23:09.891
I guess they could
use your help.

23:13.928 --> 23:16.064
If you're gonna do this,

23:16.097 --> 23:18.032
I need you to do
one thing for me.

23:18.066 --> 23:18.966
Tell me.

23:20.068 --> 23:21.302
Win!

23:25.073 --> 23:26.441
<i>Now
that my business was booming,</i>

23:26.474 --> 23:27.875
<i>I didn't have
enough hours in the day</i>

23:27.909 --> 23:30.745
<i>to take care of all the girls
who wanted abortions.</i>

23:30.778 --> 23:33.246
<i>So, we had to go to London
to learn a faster procedure.</i>

23:33.280 --> 23:36.784
Uh, today, I'll be performing
32 procedures.

23:36.818 --> 23:39.053
Thirty-two in one day?
Impressive.

23:39.087 --> 23:41.055
Yeah,
it's much more civilized now.

23:41.089 --> 23:42.857
What is that machine there
used for?

23:42.890 --> 23:44.559
Well, this is
a suction machine.

23:44.592 --> 23:48.362
The procedure is called
suction curettage.

23:48.396 --> 23:51.899
With this, I can perform
an abortion in three minutes.

23:51.933 --> 23:53.601
That's impossible.
You can't do that.

23:53.634 --> 23:56.437
You can thank the Chinese
for this.

23:56.471 --> 23:57.872
This and firecrackers.

23:57.905 --> 24:00.975
Up until how many months
can you use this machine?

24:01.008 --> 24:02.076
Four and a half,

24:02.110 --> 24:03.644
no problem.

24:03.678 --> 24:06.614
Dilation and evacuation
up to six and a half,

24:06.647 --> 24:08.583
but some doctors
even more than that.

24:12.019 --> 24:13.087
Now, if you're looking
for a nice shirt

24:13.121 --> 24:14.155
while you're in London,

24:14.188 --> 24:16.224
I can recommend
MacCulloch & Wallis.

24:16.256 --> 24:20.394
They get the cut just right.
It is your body after all.

24:21.596 --> 24:22.764
One thing to be careful of
though is,

24:22.797 --> 24:26.000
their guy is a little clumsy
with the needle,

24:26.033 --> 24:28.803
but who cares
if it stings a bit, hmm?

24:28.836 --> 24:30.772
Ah, suction machine, please?

24:30.805 --> 24:32.006
You got it.

24:32.039 --> 24:34.274
The fetus is quartered.

24:34.308 --> 24:36.811
The torso disemboweled.

24:36.844 --> 24:40.948
The head is then crushed
and extracted in parts.

24:40.982 --> 24:44.585
Then the placenta
is scraped off the womb.

24:44.619 --> 24:47.688
The last step of dilation
and evacuation is,

24:47.722 --> 24:49.624
you must reconstruct the fetus

24:49.657 --> 24:52.927
to make sure all the vital parts
have been removed.

24:52.960 --> 24:53.795
Thank you.

24:56.664 --> 24:59.433
Look, if you follow
the New York model,

24:59.467 --> 25:01.702
you're gonna be able to
maximize patients. Okay?

25:01.736 --> 25:02.770
If you need any help...

25:02.804 --> 25:04.772
We have regional centers.

25:04.806 --> 25:07.441
Planned Parenthood has centers
all over the country.

25:07.475 --> 25:08.509
Yeah.

25:08.543 --> 25:10.511
Thank you, gentlemen.

25:17.852 --> 25:19.487
We found a girl in Texas.

25:19.520 --> 25:22.190
Our gal at Planned Parenthood
Dallas, Ginny Whitehill,

25:22.223 --> 25:23.558
organized the whole thing.

25:23.591 --> 25:25.126
Did you get a lawyer
in Texas, too?

25:25.159 --> 25:27.495
A woman, and this is where
it gets good.

25:27.528 --> 25:28.996
Ginny found the perfect one.

25:29.030 --> 25:30.364
No.

25:30.398 --> 25:33.401
Young, inexperienced,
and in need of guidance.

25:33.434 --> 25:35.369
And it gets better.

25:35.403 --> 25:37.338
She works for us.

25:37.371 --> 25:38.406
What are you talking about?

25:38.439 --> 25:39.340
For Planned Parenthood.

25:39.373 --> 25:40.975
No.

25:41.008 --> 25:43.878
She even volunteers
for your group, NOW.

25:54.722 --> 25:57.892
Henry's a civil rights lawyer
but he does adoptions, too.

25:57.925 --> 25:59.927
That's how we found the girl.

25:59.961 --> 26:01.729
Norma McCorvey.
She's perfect.

26:01.762 --> 26:02.930
She was a runaway,

26:02.964 --> 26:04.532
<i>she became an alcoholic,</i>

26:04.565 --> 26:06.601
<i>a drug addict, a lesbian.</i>

26:06.634 --> 26:09.203
<i>She has a criminal record
and a ninth-grade education.</i>

26:09.237 --> 26:11.906
She is just
what you're looking for.

26:11.939 --> 26:13.875
Ginny, this is great.

26:13.908 --> 26:17.278
We need to legalize this
across the country in one swoop.

26:17.312 --> 26:20.514
Fighting state by state
will take forever.

26:20.548 --> 26:21.782
And the lawyers?

26:21.816 --> 26:23.918
Linda Coffee
and Sarah Weddington.

26:23.951 --> 26:25.286
<i>Henry McCluskey was the guy</i>

26:25.320 --> 26:27.121
<i>who not only found
the pregnant girl,</i>

26:27.154 --> 26:28.723
<i>but the lawyers, too.</i>

26:28.756 --> 26:30.558
They are super excited.

26:30.591 --> 26:32.426
Plus.

26:32.460 --> 26:34.161
they desperately needed a job.

26:36.097 --> 26:37.298
<i>Planned Parenthood</i>

26:37.332 --> 26:39.567
<i>needed Texas lawyers
they could control.</i>

26:39.600 --> 26:41.435
<i>And they wanted women.</i>

26:41.469 --> 26:44.538
<i>Sarah and Linda couldn't
get hired anywhere else.</i>

26:44.572 --> 26:46.574
<i>They were the perfect pawns.</i>

26:46.607 --> 26:48.776
You're gonna make
a constitutional claim.

26:48.809 --> 26:50.312
How are we gonna do that?

26:50.345 --> 26:52.947
Between Planned Parenthood,
NARAL, and NOW,

26:52.980 --> 26:54.248
you got a lot of help.

26:54.282 --> 26:56.050
And Norma's background?

26:56.083 --> 26:58.219
Are we worried
that's gonna affect the case?

26:58.252 --> 27:00.655
We'll give her a pseudonym.
Call her Jane Roe.

27:00.688 --> 27:02.757
<i>Calling Norma Jane Roe,</i>

27:02.790 --> 27:05.092
<i>made sure our opponents
would never be able to</i>

27:05.126 --> 27:08.729
<i>find out who she was;
never be able to question her,</i>

27:08.763 --> 27:11.933
<i>and never, ever be able to
find out the truth.</i>

27:11.966 --> 27:13.567
That's genius.

27:13.601 --> 27:15.337
That way, no one will
ever know about her past.

27:15.370 --> 27:16.904
I'll oversee the case.

27:16.938 --> 27:19.408
I'll bring in Harriet Pilpel
from Planned Parenthood.

27:19.440 --> 27:22.143
She's the country's
top constitutional expert.

27:22.176 --> 27:23.678
This is going to
the Supreme Court?

27:23.711 --> 27:25.046
We'll make sure of it.

27:26.447 --> 27:29.684
But, I-I've never even
tried a case.

27:29.717 --> 27:32.387
Don't worry, we have.

27:35.189 --> 27:36.958
<i>Larry liked
to go to St. Croix.</i>

27:36.991 --> 27:38.427
<i>He called them
working vacations.</i>

27:38.459 --> 27:39.627
Okay, Bernie.

27:39.660 --> 27:40.494
<i>He said that's where</i>

27:40.528 --> 27:41.963
<i>he got his best ideas.</i>

27:41.996 --> 27:43.332
- <i>This time, I went with him.</i>
- Look, they do need us.

27:43.365 --> 27:44.665
<i>We were going to celebrate</i>

27:44.699 --> 27:46.133
- <i>winning New York.</i>
- Here's the strategy, okay.

27:46.167 --> 27:48.636
First, we have to get
the media on our side.

27:48.669 --> 27:50.137
That's a good idea, okay.

27:50.171 --> 27:52.341
Second,
they need to know

27:52.374 --> 27:54.175
there's no life at conception.

27:54.208 --> 27:57.144
Yeah, but I'm not really sure
that's accurate.

27:58.347 --> 27:59.213
Well, you're a doctor.

27:59.246 --> 28:00.382
We're gonna need testimonials.

28:00.415 --> 28:02.883
What about
what the other experts say?

28:02.917 --> 28:05.219
We'll make sure no one's gonna
hear what they have to say.

28:05.252 --> 28:07.555
<i>I couldn't
believe what he just said.</i>

28:07.588 --> 28:10.157
<i>Larry wanted me
to bury the truth.</i>

28:10.191 --> 28:14.161
<i>I was really conflicted but.
I went along with it anyway.</i>

28:14.195 --> 28:15.629
Right? Listen.

28:15.663 --> 28:19.200
Most important, every revolution
needs a villain, okay?

28:19.233 --> 28:21.403
Whether it's a dictator
or a king.

28:21.436 --> 28:24.205
People need to see a face,
something to rebel against.

28:24.238 --> 28:26.974
It's easier for them
to perceive.

28:27.008 --> 28:30.745
We need to narrow the focus,
okay,

28:30.778 --> 28:33.348
identify it with a person

28:33.382 --> 28:36.250
or a small group of shadowy,
powerful people.

28:38.052 --> 28:39.053
Don't you see?

28:40.755 --> 28:43.057
In our country there's been
one group associated with

28:43.090 --> 28:44.326
reactionary politics,

28:44.359 --> 28:46.260
behind-the-scenes
manipulations,

28:46.293 --> 28:47.928
and backward ideas.

28:47.962 --> 28:50.264
Wait, not the Catholics again?

28:50.297 --> 28:52.566
<i>Oh, well.
What did I really care?</i>

28:52.600 --> 28:54.835
<i>I mean, although my parents
were Jewish,</i>

28:54.869 --> 28:56.737
<i>I was more of an atheist.</i>

28:56.771 --> 28:59.206
Of course, the Catholics.
Yes!

29:02.777 --> 29:04.912
Norma.

29:04.945 --> 29:06.714
good to see you again.

29:06.747 --> 29:07.715
Come here.

29:11.420 --> 29:12.286
This is Sarah.

29:19.960 --> 29:22.863
So, you're seeking
an abortion?

29:22.897 --> 29:25.566
Yeah, you know
where I can get one?

29:27.436 --> 29:30.905
I'm so sorry, I do not.

29:39.314 --> 29:40.714
How about an illegal one?

29:40.748 --> 29:42.216
No!

29:42.249 --> 29:43.284
<i>Okay, well, Sarah did know</i>

29:43.318 --> 29:44.618
<i>where to get an illegal one.</i>

29:44.652 --> 29:46.555
<i>She had one in Mexico.</i>

29:46.587 --> 29:48.789
<i>But we needed them to say
whatever it took</i>

29:48.823 --> 29:50.791
<i>to get her to come on board.</i>

29:50.825 --> 29:55.062
<i>It was for the greater good.
This was lie number one.</i>

29:55.096 --> 29:56.964
Why the heck not?

29:56.997 --> 29:59.300
Because it's dangerous.

29:59.334 --> 30:00.935
What am I even doing here then?

30:00.968 --> 30:03.070
Mr. McCluskey said
I could trust y'all.

30:03.104 --> 30:04.605
He's great.

30:04.638 --> 30:07.342
We'll still consult
with McCluskey, okay?

30:07.375 --> 30:09.910
I can't be
having no baby, okay?

30:09.944 --> 30:13.415
I got no job, no husband,
no home.

30:13.448 --> 30:15.417
You don't wanna to
put your child up for adoption?

30:15.450 --> 30:18.052
No, I can't
go through that again.

30:21.021 --> 30:22.957
Thank you.

30:22.990 --> 30:25.960
How did you become pregnant
in the first place?

30:25.993 --> 30:26.994
Can I?

30:31.466 --> 30:34.969
Norma, if we are gonna
represent you,

30:35.002 --> 30:38.172
we need to know everything.

30:38.205 --> 30:40.542
Did anything bad happen?

30:40.575 --> 30:43.978
I was, uhm, raped.

30:44.011 --> 30:46.013
<i>Norma may have been suicidal,</i>

30:46.046 --> 30:49.384
<i>but she admitted years later,
she lied about being raped.</i>

30:50.519 --> 30:51.419
Raped?

30:53.154 --> 30:55.156
I'm so sorry.

30:55.189 --> 30:56.525
No woman should ever
have to give birth

30:56.558 --> 30:58.360
to her attacker's child.

30:58.393 --> 31:01.195
Hmm, is the case
gonna be over in enough time?

31:01.228 --> 31:02.531
That's why I'm doing this.

31:02.564 --> 31:05.299
Yes, of course.

31:05.333 --> 31:06.368
<i>Lie number two.</i>

31:09.003 --> 31:11.339
We will do our best to win.

31:11.373 --> 31:14.742
So, what happens
during an abortion?

31:14.775 --> 31:16.810
Does the baby go back?

31:16.844 --> 31:20.348
Like when John Wayne
aborts a mission?

31:20.382 --> 31:22.683
Well, there is no baby.

31:22.716 --> 31:24.218
<i>And ladies and gentlemen,</i>

31:24.251 --> 31:26.588
<i>lie number three.</i>

31:26.621 --> 31:29.056
It's like removing
a piece of tissue.

31:29.089 --> 31:30.525
The baby comes later, Norma.

31:30.559 --> 31:31.593
Much later.

31:33.260 --> 31:34.529
Like passing a period.

31:36.030 --> 31:39.434
So, y'all got
a lot of experience with this.

31:39.467 --> 31:41.202
We're going to file in Dallas.

31:41.235 --> 31:42.537
But I live in Houston.

31:42.571 --> 31:45.340
I know, but I clerked for
Judge Hughes in Dallas

31:45.373 --> 31:47.676
and I know her position
on the topic.

31:47.708 --> 31:51.346
We just need you to read
these papers and sign.

31:51.379 --> 31:53.847
And then, we'll just-we'll
get everything going.

31:53.881 --> 31:55.383
It's all right.
I trust y'all.

32:09.497 --> 32:11.732
Get out! Get out!

32:14.268 --> 32:16.304
Wait.

32:16.338 --> 32:17.606
wait.

32:21.409 --> 32:23.978
They lied to me.

32:24.011 --> 32:26.113
They told me
we would have won by now.

32:28.249 --> 32:31.785
Call them!
Tell them to get McCluskey!

32:32.853 --> 32:33.988
<i>Obviously,</i>

32:34.021 --> 32:35.423
<i>the case didn't
get to court in time.</i>

32:40.261 --> 32:42.896
Ha-ha! Mr. Floyd,
welcome to Dallas.

32:42.930 --> 32:44.131
- How's the Governor?
- He's still reeling

32:44.164 --> 32:45.966
over your Lee Harvey Oswald
debacle.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.737
Well, he should have appointed
me instead of Sarah Hughes.

32:48.769 --> 32:49.803
You'll want to hear this.

32:49.837 --> 32:51.573
Two young lawyers just filed...

32:51.606 --> 32:54.942
Whoop dee doo,
goody for them.

32:54.975 --> 32:57.312
In Judge Hughes' court,
and it's about...

32:57.345 --> 33:01.915
Oh, let me guess, abortion!

33:03.050 --> 33:06.020
You know,
that Sarah Hughes, she...

33:06.053 --> 33:07.489
anything to get at me.

33:08.789 --> 33:10.190
So.

33:10.224 --> 33:14.128
So, these gals,
fresh out of UT Law,

33:14.161 --> 33:16.765
are bringin'
an abortion case to Texas.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.269
Thank you.
I needed a good laugh.

33:22.304 --> 33:23.804
You should be worried, Hank!

33:23.837 --> 33:26.874
About what? Prissy feminists
looking to stir up the pot?

33:26.907 --> 33:28.443
Tolle, come in here.
You need to hear this.

33:28.476 --> 33:30.345
They're causing a ruckus
all over the country.

33:30.378 --> 33:32.314
Any decent lawyer

33:32.347 --> 33:34.783
can try this case
with his eyes closed.

33:34.815 --> 33:37.686
You-you-you argue the case.

33:37.719 --> 33:40.455
Show these girls some good
old-fashioned Texas morals.

33:40.488 --> 33:41.889
It's not about morals, Hank!

33:41.922 --> 33:43.325
Well, that's just ignorant.

33:43.358 --> 33:46.026
Why don't we legalize murder
while we're at it?

33:46.060 --> 33:47.629
Who's this Jane Roe anyway?

33:50.030 --> 33:54.336
Well, she's healthy,
so the baby can't kill her.

33:54.369 --> 33:57.472
So, she can't have
an abortion in Texas.

33:57.505 --> 34:00.207
Why doesn't she move
to New York City?

34:00.240 --> 34:02.744
They're gonna bring up
some women's rights violations.

34:02.777 --> 34:05.547
A woman's right
to kill her own baby?

34:08.683 --> 34:09.718
You're right.

34:11.285 --> 34:12.587
There's no way
anyone with a conscience

34:12.620 --> 34:13.822
could legalize
killin' a child.

34:13.854 --> 34:16.090
And that's why
I prosecuted Jack Ruby

34:16.123 --> 34:18.158
for killing Lee Harvey Oswald.

34:18.192 --> 34:20.994
No judge or jury
in their right mind

34:21.028 --> 34:26.166
would ever let abortion happen
in Texas, ever.

34:26.200 --> 34:27.736
Ever.

34:27.769 --> 34:29.169
I'm Jay Floyd,

34:29.203 --> 34:30.904
Assistant Attorney General
of the State of Texas.

34:30.938 --> 34:32.005
The parties in this lawsuit

34:32.039 --> 34:32.807
have no standing
before the court.

34:33.941 --> 34:35.410
Jane Roe no longer
seeks an abortion.

34:35.443 --> 34:37.177
She has had the baby
or is having it.

34:37.211 --> 34:38.178
Are we gonna let the delay

34:38.212 --> 34:40.280
in the hearing
abort the case?

34:40.315 --> 34:42.417
She may want to
engage in activity

34:42.450 --> 34:43.685
where she'll become pregnant,

34:43.718 --> 34:45.252
and then she may want
an abortion.

34:45.285 --> 34:47.221
The law's whether or not
the party has standing

34:47.254 --> 34:49.457
at the time the issues
are decided in the case.

34:49.491 --> 34:51.459
This statute takes effect

34:51.493 --> 34:54.261
regardless of when
the embryo takes effect.

34:54.294 --> 34:56.431
I mean, at first week?

34:56.464 --> 34:57.632
There have been many arguments

34:57.665 --> 34:59.467
as to when an embryo
becomes a human being.

34:59.501 --> 35:01.101
There have been
many religious groups

35:01.135 --> 35:02.704
that have joined
in that controversy,

35:02.737 --> 35:05.105
and I'm not setting forth
the Catholic faith.

35:05.139 --> 35:07.241
How is that
gettin' you anywhere?

35:07.274 --> 35:08.710
The point is,

35:08.743 --> 35:10.545
the state's interest
is whether or not murder occurs,

35:10.578 --> 35:12.913
and if the embryo is considered
a human being.

35:12.946 --> 35:16.418
There have been
many opinions on privacy.

35:16.451 --> 35:20.755
So, you're saying that if Texas
were to approve abortion,

35:20.789 --> 35:24.559
that it would be considered a
direct killin' of our citizens?

35:24.592 --> 35:28.329
I-I think this is a bad word
in this situation,

35:28.363 --> 35:29.831
although everybody
seems to want to use it.

35:29.864 --> 35:31.733
I haven't come up
with a phrase myself,

35:31.766 --> 35:33.768
but I don't think
privacy is gonna do it.

35:33.802 --> 35:36.170
The State's position is
the right of that child to life

35:36.203 --> 35:38.606
is superior to the woman's
right to privacy.

35:40.341 --> 35:41.476
Then an argument could be made

35:41.509 --> 35:44.077
that an abortion
isn't necessary,

35:44.111 --> 35:46.448
a medical argument because of
the health of the mother.

35:46.481 --> 35:48.416
Any possible change
in the relevant law

35:48.450 --> 35:51.453
is a matter for the state
legislators and not the courts.

36:02.464 --> 36:05.834
First Amendment rights
or Ninth Amendment rights,

36:05.867 --> 36:07.469
I feel that they are
so important that they deserve

36:07.502 --> 36:09.370
special protection.

36:09.404 --> 36:11.706
They involve fundamental
human freedoms.

36:11.739 --> 36:14.542
The State has not tried to
prosecute unfairly, has it?

36:14.576 --> 36:16.511
The State is prosecuting
against physicians.

36:16.544 --> 36:19.179
Do you think the entire
statute should be stricken?

36:19.213 --> 36:20.415
Yes.

36:22.082 --> 36:23.885
- Is the court worried about...?
- Ah...

36:23.918 --> 36:26.454
We worry about a lot of things.
Don't let that worry you.

36:29.557 --> 36:31.124
I think the statute is so bad

36:31.158 --> 36:33.495
that the court just has to
strike it all down.

36:33.528 --> 36:37.532
So, you think 63 years
of unconstitutionality

36:37.565 --> 36:40.969
should've worn everyone's
constitutional patience?

36:41.001 --> 36:42.135
Is that what you're saying?

36:42.169 --> 36:43.505
I think the State
has had plenty of time

36:43.538 --> 36:45.038
to construe this statute.

36:59.387 --> 37:01.756
<i>This was
the judge Linda clerked for,</i>

37:01.789 --> 37:03.223
<i>and she obviously
made her decision</i>

37:03.257 --> 37:05.393
<i>before she even heard the case.</i>

37:05.426 --> 37:07.261
<i>I think the wink gave it away.</i>

37:09.129 --> 37:11.566
I would like to draw to
the court's attention that life

37:11.599 --> 37:13.835
is an ongoing process.

37:13.868 --> 37:15.870
It is almost impossible
to define at which point

37:15.904 --> 37:18.006
life begins or

37:18.038 --> 37:20.173
perhaps even when life ends.

37:20.207 --> 37:24.244
Assuming there is a Ninth
Amendment right to privacy,

37:24.278 --> 37:25.847
does the state have
any compelling reason

37:25.880 --> 37:28.550
to regulate
or modify that right?

37:28.583 --> 37:30.919
I cannot see
any justification for regulation

37:30.952 --> 37:33.021
when the abortion's
being done by a doctor.

37:33.053 --> 37:36.524
The state of the pregnancy
or anything?

37:36.558 --> 37:40.060
The stage of the pregnancy
is pause for concern, um.

37:41.496 --> 37:44.032
You could recognize life
when the fetus is able to live

37:44.064 --> 37:46.266
outside the body of the mother.

37:46.300 --> 37:49.537
It might be dependent on
whether she has money or not?

37:49.571 --> 37:54.042
The young,
those still in school,

37:54.074 --> 37:59.279
those unable to shoulder
the responsibility of a child,

37:59.314 --> 38:01.883
these girls should not be
put through the pregnancy

38:01.916 --> 38:04.284
and should be entitled
to an abortion.

38:20.635 --> 38:22.135
Gentlemen, inside, now!

38:25.607 --> 38:28.576
I told you any decent lawyer
could win this case!

38:28.610 --> 38:31.779
You, Mr. Floyd, are apparently
not a decent lawyer.

38:31.813 --> 38:33.581
The judge's decision
was political;

38:33.615 --> 38:34.782
nobody could've done anything.

38:34.816 --> 38:36.149
You weren't prepared!

38:36.183 --> 38:39.252
You didn't bring in
any medical experts to testify

38:39.286 --> 38:41.489
that life begins at conception!

38:41.522 --> 38:44.191
They said the Constitution
didn't apply to the unborn.

38:44.224 --> 38:45.660
We'll fight the decision, Hank!

38:45.693 --> 38:49.097
Fight? You didn't even
bring in all of the case law.

38:49.129 --> 38:52.600
Dozens that do protect
the rights of the unborn!

38:52.634 --> 38:54.167
You've embarrassed this office.

38:54.201 --> 38:56.169
Sir, if you would just listen
to what I have to say, I could...

38:56.203 --> 38:59.807
Planned Parenthood
in their own words agree,

38:59.841 --> 39:04.379
"Abortion kills the life
of the baby after it's begun"!

39:04.412 --> 39:06.648
Right here in their own damn
pamphlet!

39:11.151 --> 39:13.554
You research this Jane Roe

39:13.588 --> 39:15.957
to see if she's
telling the truth.

39:15.990 --> 39:18.726
Mr. Tolle,
I will deal with you.

39:18.760 --> 39:21.062
Mr. Floyd,
you deal with the Governor.

39:25.265 --> 39:27.869
I will appeal this all the way
to the Supreme Court,

39:27.902 --> 39:29.937
so help me God!

39:31.406 --> 39:33.173
Until the appeals process
is over,

39:33.206 --> 39:36.243
abortion is still illegal
in Texas.

39:36.276 --> 39:39.080
<i>Potter keeps pushing Roe.</i>

39:39.113 --> 39:40.247
<i>I think we should wait.</i>

39:41.749 --> 39:42.817
The Senate has rejected

39:42.850 --> 39:45.920
each of Nixon's
appointments so far.

39:45.953 --> 39:47.855
Who knows how long
this could take.

39:47.889 --> 39:50.758
Obviously, they're just trying
as many cases as they can

39:50.792 --> 39:52.225
while they're still in control.

39:53.861 --> 39:55.730
Your letter to Nixon
did help get your friend

39:55.763 --> 39:57.065
Blackmun on the bench.

39:57.098 --> 39:58.866
Well, I had to do something.

39:58.900 --> 40:02.403
Nothing like that
has happened in 40 years.

40:02.437 --> 40:04.271
At this rate, the liberals
will never let Nixon

40:04.305 --> 40:06.741
appoint any new justices.

40:06.774 --> 40:09.877
It could be
Rehnquist and Powell.

40:09.911 --> 40:12.413
Who the hell knows
where they stand.

40:12.447 --> 40:13.681
What are you thinking, Byron?

40:13.715 --> 40:16.050
Seven judges,
only six are required.

40:16.084 --> 40:17.618
<i>The Supreme Court</i>

40:17.652 --> 40:18.920
<i>has nine justices.</i>

40:18.953 --> 40:20.621
<i>Two had just retired,</i>

40:20.655 --> 40:22.255
<i>and Nixon was fighting
with the Senate</i>

40:22.289 --> 40:24.425
<i>over his replacements.</i>

40:24.459 --> 40:30.531
This is far too. Too sensitive
a matter for seven.

40:30.565 --> 40:32.232
Well, we just decided
the Vuitch case.

40:32.265 --> 40:34.736
I'll bring that up
and we'll-we'll move on.

40:36.304 --> 40:38.773
Roe v. Wade,
in the grand scheme of things,

40:38.806 --> 40:41.409
is not that important.

40:41.442 --> 40:42.543
The Vuitch case!

40:42.577 --> 40:45.113
I don't-I don't see
the correlation.

40:45.146 --> 40:47.215
These people,
they want-they want abortion

40:47.247 --> 40:49.050
for reasons other than
life or health.

40:49.083 --> 40:50.451
They want abortion on demand.

40:52.320 --> 40:53.921
Well, we'll see.

41:03.197 --> 41:05.133
What's all the commotion,
my jurists?

41:06.934 --> 41:09.971
Professor, everyone's talking
about what's happening in Texas.

41:10.004 --> 41:11.506
Is that what's on your minds?

41:11.539 --> 41:13.808
Only fanatics
are against abortion.

41:13.841 --> 41:15.109
Oh, really?

41:17.145 --> 41:18.179
Mother Teresa?

41:18.212 --> 41:20.014
Martin Luther King?
The Dalai Lama?

41:21.883 --> 41:23.484
"It would seem to me
clear as daylight

41:23.518 --> 41:25.353
- that abortion would be a crime."
- Mahatma Gandhi.

41:25.386 --> 41:26.521
Fanatics?

41:26.554 --> 41:28.189
None of them
were getting pregnant.

41:28.222 --> 41:30.992
Regardless, we should have the
right to control our own bodies.

41:31.025 --> 41:32.994
Yes, one should have the right

41:33.027 --> 41:34.996
to do whatever she wants
with her own actual body.

41:35.029 --> 41:36.764
But let me ask you something.

41:36.798 --> 41:39.433
What happens when that body

41:39.467 --> 41:41.969
starts to interfere
with another body?

41:42.003 --> 41:43.004
You mean,
the rights of the fetus?

41:43.037 --> 41:45.706
It is part of our own bodies.

41:45.740 --> 41:47.375
All of your body parts

41:47.408 --> 41:51.045
share the same DNA,
except the fetus.

41:51.078 --> 41:53.381
So, the child, by definition,

41:53.414 --> 41:56.684
is not part of
anyone's body but their own.

41:56.717 --> 41:58.152
But how can you say
it's a life?

41:58.186 --> 41:59.487
It can't live
without the mother.

41:59.520 --> 42:01.956
Well, Dan.

42:01.989 --> 42:03.491
Were you able to feed yourself

42:03.524 --> 42:05.359
without your mother,
the day after you were born?

42:05.393 --> 42:06.794
- Well.
- Not even a one-year-old

42:06.828 --> 42:09.130
or a two-year-old
can take care of themselves.

42:09.163 --> 42:11.699
Dan can't even
take care of himself now.

42:14.068 --> 42:15.069
You think this is funny?

42:16.871 --> 42:20.208
You all protest
the killing in Vietnam.

42:20.241 --> 42:23.010
So, am I confused,
or is this just hypocrisy?

42:23.044 --> 42:24.212
The elderly,

42:24.245 --> 42:26.747
the handicapped,
the incapacitated,

42:26.781 --> 42:28.149
they can't take care
of themselves.

42:28.182 --> 42:29.517
Should we eliminate them too?

42:29.550 --> 42:31.085
What about birth defects?

42:31.118 --> 42:34.522
To kill an unborn child
because of defects

42:34.555 --> 42:37.692
is what the Nazis
used to do to the Jews.

42:37.725 --> 42:38.926
Let me give you a riddle.

42:42.063 --> 42:43.831
The father,

42:43.865 --> 42:45.666
syphilitic.

42:45.700 --> 42:47.535
The mother had tuberculosis.

42:47.568 --> 42:50.705
Of their four children,
one was blind, the second died,

42:50.738 --> 42:52.106
the third was deaf and dumb,

42:52.139 --> 42:53.641
and the fourth
had tuberculosis, too.

42:56.277 --> 42:57.745
If the mother
got pregnant again,

43:00.448 --> 43:01.949
what would you do with the baby?

43:01.983 --> 43:03.284
I wouldn't want my child

43:03.318 --> 43:05.553
to grow up disabled
and suffer.

43:05.586 --> 43:07.121
You would have
killed Beethoven.

43:08.556 --> 43:11.425
Don't you think
that someone's hopelessness

43:11.459 --> 43:15.364
should motivate us
to protect them,

43:15.396 --> 43:16.931
not destroy them?

43:23.305 --> 43:24.438
Is everything okay?

43:26.741 --> 43:31.979
I.I can't take care
of a baby right now.

43:32.013 --> 43:32.847
I see.

43:34.349 --> 43:36.751
And I can't tell
my family about this.

43:41.422 --> 43:42.823
They can't know.

43:45.159 --> 43:46.894
<i>You do know
I love you, right?</i>

43:46.928 --> 43:49.096
I can't take care
of a baby right now.

44:03.678 --> 44:05.112
My life is over.

44:05.146 --> 44:07.081
I'm so sorry, Mary.

44:07.114 --> 44:09.450
The hospital
limits me with quotas.

44:09.483 --> 44:11.786
So, each of you
are only permitted to do

44:11.819 --> 44:13.322
20 abortions a week.

44:13.355 --> 44:14.789
That's like saying I've done
too many gall bladders

44:14.822 --> 44:16.490
but I can still do
hernia repairs.

44:16.524 --> 44:18.826
This is a democratic approach.

44:18.859 --> 44:21.629
To limit a woman's access
to health care?

44:21.662 --> 44:24.131
Staff members should have
equal access to beds and ORs.

44:24.165 --> 44:25.833
I've already
fulfilled my quota.

44:25.866 --> 44:28.936
Dr. Berg won't do abortions,
let me use his.

44:28.970 --> 44:31.839
We can't transfer
another doctor's quotas to you.

44:31.872 --> 44:37.278
Hah, I get this.
I get what's going on here.

44:37.312 --> 44:40.047
This is an attack on us! Why?

44:40.081 --> 44:43.484
Because we were the ones
outspoken on reform?

44:43.517 --> 44:45.720
Yeah, I've heard the whispers
in the locker room

44:45.753 --> 44:47.521
and I've gotten the looks
in the hallway,

44:47.555 --> 44:49.690
the half portions
in the cafeteria,

44:49.724 --> 44:52.293
the sneers
and the nicknames.

44:52.327 --> 44:55.629
This isn't high school.
You can't hurt me.

44:55.663 --> 44:57.131
Because I'm proud of what I do,

44:57.164 --> 44:59.633
and I'm proud to help
the women of this country.

44:59.667 --> 45:02.471
So, if you wanna humiliate me

45:02.503 --> 45:06.707
and call me the Scraper
behind my back,

45:06.741 --> 45:09.510
I'll wear it
as a badge of honor.

45:09.543 --> 45:14.582
Or if you wanna ridicule me
and call me the Abortion King,

45:14.615 --> 45:17.685
I'll wear that title with pride.

45:17.718 --> 45:19.920
Because when a woman
is at her wits' end,

45:19.954 --> 45:21.689
and she has no one else
to turn to,

45:21.722 --> 45:24.258
when she's too frightened
to tell her family

45:24.291 --> 45:26.927
or fears going to the butcher,

45:26.961 --> 45:28.596
when she has to
spend her last dime

45:28.629 --> 45:30.097
to catch the Greyhound

45:30.131 --> 45:32.434
or hitchhike her way
to New York,

45:32.467 --> 45:36.270
when she breaks down in tears
crying out for her savior

45:36.304 --> 45:40.207
and when your God
can't help her, Kenneth.

45:41.776 --> 45:44.078
Who do you think
she's crying for?

45:51.118 --> 45:52.720
<i>I decided to fight back,</i>

45:52.753 --> 45:55.390
<i>so I had Larry call
and leak the story to the press</i>

45:55.424 --> 45:57.625
<i>and feed some of this
good raw meat</i>

45:57.658 --> 45:59.660
<i>to the drooling beasts
in the media.</i>

46:01.128 --> 46:02.897
Yeah. Hi, Kate?

46:02.930 --> 46:04.899
Yes, Larry Lader.

46:04.932 --> 46:06.801
How are you?

46:06.834 --> 46:09.136
I have a story for you.

46:11.306 --> 46:13.408
Hi. I was hoping to
speak to someone

46:13.442 --> 46:15.176
about the quotas
you put on abortions.

46:20.081 --> 46:22.883
It's amazing how the quotas
magically dried up.

46:22.917 --> 46:26.053
Time of death?

46:26.087 --> 46:28.155
<i>And the Medicine section
of</i> Time Magazine

46:28.189 --> 46:29.990
<i>had a three-column spread.</i>

46:31.493 --> 46:34.662
Thanks for getting those quotas
lifted, Your Majesty.

46:34.695 --> 46:36.163
Aw. Thank you, Sire.

46:36.197 --> 46:38.999
Your favorite,
corn flakes.

46:41.369 --> 46:45.272
You know
that John Harvey Kellogg

46:45.307 --> 46:49.243
created corn flakes
as an anti-aphrodisiac.

46:49.276 --> 46:53.114
He believed bland foods
decreased sex drive.

46:53.147 --> 46:54.416
Oh, well.

46:54.449 --> 46:57.284
I hope that's not true,
for Joan's sake.

46:57.319 --> 46:59.286
Did I miss something?

46:59.321 --> 47:01.523
Yeah, your husband's
trivial knowledge.

47:01.556 --> 47:04.125
He also founded
the Race Betterment Foundation

47:04.158 --> 47:06.827
which paved the way
for Margaret Sanger.

47:06.861 --> 47:08.662
Don't eat that.

47:08.696 --> 47:09.630
Huh?

47:13.834 --> 47:15.537
Are you gonna stop me?

47:15.570 --> 47:16.737
Eat up.

47:27.014 --> 47:29.584
Could you quiet them down,
Joan?

47:32.320 --> 47:34.456
Let me show you somethin'.

47:35.756 --> 47:37.691
We need to come up
with a jingle.

47:37.725 --> 47:39.528
Something catchy.

47:39.561 --> 47:41.996
Bernie, what was that song
you told me about?

47:42.029 --> 47:44.865
The one that doctors used to
sing during your residency.

47:44.899 --> 47:46.501
Oh, I can't do that.

47:46.535 --> 47:48.035
- I can't...
- You have a song?

47:49.404 --> 47:50.572
Aw, come on, Bernie.
Don't be shy.

47:50.605 --> 47:52.039
No way, no, no, no, no.

47:52.072 --> 47:53.174
Let it out.

47:53.207 --> 47:54.675
I'm no Stravinsky.
I can't, I can't...

47:54.708 --> 47:58.480
Well, Joan is.
Joan! Joan, help.

47:58.513 --> 48:00.181
Why don't you
get us started.

48:00.214 --> 48:02.183
- I'll join in.
- Ah.

48:02.216 --> 48:03.518
Come on.
Come on, Bernie.

48:03.552 --> 48:04.818
Okay, fine, fine, fine.

48:04.852 --> 48:06.421
Sing it!

48:07.522 --> 48:08.590
Okay. Fine.

I found the Catholics!

48:50.297 --> 48:51.899
Those Vatican devils,

48:51.932 --> 48:53.934
starting right here
with the big cheese:

48:53.968 --> 48:56.471
Cardinal Cooke,
Father McHugh,

48:56.504 --> 48:58.872
Robert Byrn,
Charlie Rice,

48:58.906 --> 49:01.409
Ellen McCormack,
even Ed Golden.

49:01.443 --> 49:04.044
If we're gonna succeed,
people have gotta be scared!

49:04.078 --> 49:06.280
Well, men are governed
by lines of intellect,

49:06.314 --> 49:07.982
women by curves of emotion.

49:08.015 --> 49:09.618
That's our Catholic strategy,
right there.

49:09.651 --> 49:11.118
Perfect.

49:11.151 --> 49:13.421
Well, these guys have been
scaring people for years!

49:13.455 --> 49:15.055
How are we looking
on the new numbers?

49:15.089 --> 49:17.091
A million illegal abortions
a year;

49:17.124 --> 49:18.792
10,000 die in back alleys.

49:18.826 --> 49:20.662
<i>I completely made that up.</i>

49:20.695 --> 49:22.963
<i>A million illegal
abortions a year?</i>

49:22.997 --> 49:26.934
<i>Ten thousand die in back alleys?
Not even close.</i>

49:26.967 --> 49:28.670
That's like a hand grenade
in a maternity ward.

49:28.703 --> 49:31.805
But we need slogans,
battle cries.

49:31.839 --> 49:32.973
Not statistics.

49:33.007 --> 49:34.342
People trust numbers.

49:34.376 --> 49:35.510
Yeah.

49:35.543 --> 49:38.279
Cyril's right.
People do trust numbers.

49:38.313 --> 49:40.348
But Betty is also right.

49:40.382 --> 49:42.283
People need something
to grab on to,

49:42.317 --> 49:44.452
something to hook
in their brains

49:44.486 --> 49:46.186
that feel like
they're part of the movement.

49:46.220 --> 49:47.154
You want a slogan?

49:47.187 --> 49:48.122
Yeah.

49:49.223 --> 49:50.858
I have a slogan.

49:50.891 --> 49:53.927
It's a woman's body.
It's her right to choose.

49:53.961 --> 49:55.664
We are the pro-choice people.

49:55.697 --> 49:57.365
- That's amazing.
- Pro-choice.

49:57.399 --> 49:58.466
Uh-huh.

49:58.500 --> 49:59.833
Pro... we're pro-choice.

49:59.867 --> 50:03.338
Yes, it's-it's pro-freedom,
it-it's pro-liberty.

50:03.371 --> 50:04.972
Who can argue with it?

50:05.005 --> 50:07.141
They came up with the slogan...
pro-choice.

50:07.174 --> 50:09.009
Pro-choice?

50:10.645 --> 50:14.549
What an evasive, fraudulent
and deceptive term.

50:14.582 --> 50:16.116
<i>According to recent statistics,</i>

50:16.150 --> 50:18.720
<i>over one million women
are having illegal abortions</i>

50:18.753 --> 50:20.287
<i>every year in America.</i>

50:20.322 --> 50:22.056
<i>And over 10,000 are dying</i>

50:22.089 --> 50:24.191
<i>from these back alley
type procedures.</i>

50:28.430 --> 50:30.332
Why aren't we taking
our own polls?

50:30.365 --> 50:32.467
They told the press
that one in three Catholics

50:32.500 --> 50:33.735
are for abortion!

50:33.768 --> 50:35.035
Because
we don't have the money!

50:35.069 --> 50:36.170
Why didn't this Jane Roe

50:36.203 --> 50:38.005
just give the baby up
for adoption?

50:38.038 --> 50:40.742
There is a long waiting list
for white babies.

50:42.042 --> 50:42.943
This was political.

50:45.012 --> 50:46.348
Judge Hughes
kept her hidden.

50:48.350 --> 50:50.585
We gotta get Wade
on the phone.

50:55.889 --> 50:56.990
<i>District Attorney's office,</i>

50:57.024 --> 50:58.058
<i>may I help you?</i>

50:58.092 --> 50:59.761
Robert Byrn for Henry Wade.

50:59.794 --> 51:01.696
What can I do for you, Bobby?

51:01.730 --> 51:03.365
I've got the team here.

51:03.398 --> 51:05.533
The Supreme Court
will hear the case!

51:07.301 --> 51:08.536
Let us know if we can help.

51:11.373 --> 51:12.574
<i>It was time to prepare</i>

51:12.607 --> 51:13.608
<i>for the Supreme Court.</i>

51:14.908 --> 51:16.877
<i>While some focused
on saving lives,</i>

51:19.547 --> 51:21.281
<i>others had no idea
what was coming.</i>

51:23.785 --> 51:25.919
<i>Everyone had their own agenda.</i>

51:25.953 --> 51:27.856
<i>We used Sarah and the lawyers
from Planned Parenthood</i>

51:27.888 --> 51:28.989
<i>to fulfill ours.</i>

51:31.826 --> 51:33.395
<i>Certainties as unquestioned</i>

51:33.428 --> 51:36.731
<i>as the U.S. Constitution
itself, trembled!</i>

51:56.584 --> 51:58.152
All rise!

52:14.469 --> 52:17.070
<i>There
were still only seven justices</i>

52:17.104 --> 52:18.972
<i>because Nixon still
wasn't able to</i>

52:19.006 --> 52:20.842
<i>get his two picks confirmed.</i>

52:23.711 --> 52:25.914
I am completely
out of my depth.

52:25.946 --> 52:27.281
Don't be nervous.

52:27.315 --> 52:29.149
You had the best of the best
prepare you.

52:30.017 --> 52:31.453
You'll be fine.

52:58.580 --> 53:02.182
We will hear arguments

53:02.216 --> 53:05.620
in Roe against Wade.

53:05.653 --> 53:07.822
Mrs. Weddington,
you may proceed.

53:20.200 --> 53:22.169
Mr. Chief Justice,
may it please the court.

53:23.872 --> 53:26.641
The court declared
the Texas abortion law

53:26.674 --> 53:30.077
to be unconstitutional
for two reasons.

53:30.110 --> 53:32.914
First, the law was vague,

53:32.947 --> 53:36.518
and second,
it violated a woman's right

53:36.551 --> 53:39.587
to continue or terminate
a pregnancy.

53:39.621 --> 53:42.657
The Texas law permits
abortions be performed

53:42.690 --> 53:45.693
only for the purpose of
saving the life of the woman.

53:47.529 --> 53:50.097
When this case of yours

53:50.130 --> 53:51.666
was in the district court,

53:51.699 --> 53:54.736
the case of Vuitch against
the United States

53:54.769 --> 53:57.005
had not been decided here.

53:57.037 --> 53:58.071
That is correct.

53:58.105 --> 53:59.607
Now that it has,

53:59.641 --> 54:01.509
do you think that
that disposes of

54:01.543 --> 54:03.578
some of the questions
you're raising now?

54:03.611 --> 54:05.947
Your Honor, I do not.

54:05.980 --> 54:07.515
In the Vuitch decision,

54:07.549 --> 54:10.418
this court was working with
a statute which provided

54:10.451 --> 54:12.252
that an abortion
could be permitted

54:12.286 --> 54:14.556
for reasons of health or life.

54:14.589 --> 54:17.592
Does Texas law,
in other areas of the law,

54:17.625 --> 54:19.961
give rights to the unborn?

54:19.994 --> 54:24.699
In an area such as trusts,
estates, wills or elsewhere?

54:24.732 --> 54:27.936
The Supreme Court of Texas
recently held a case

54:27.969 --> 54:31.138
in which there is action for
prenatal injuries at any stage

54:31.171 --> 54:33.942
prior to birth,
but only upon the condition

54:33.975 --> 54:35.743
that it be born alive.

54:51.359 --> 54:53.995
Mr. Justice, it's an old joke,

54:54.028 --> 54:58.733
but when a man argues against
two beautiful ladies,

54:58.766 --> 55:00.200
they're gonna have
the last word.

55:06.139 --> 55:10.645
As to the-as to the unmarried
pregnant female,

55:10.678 --> 55:13.180
a unique situation arises.

55:13.213 --> 55:14.616
Is her action moot?

55:16.451 --> 55:19.020
It has been recognized
by the appellant's counsel

55:19.053 --> 55:21.923
that she is no longer pregnant.

55:21.956 --> 55:25.360
Of course, if moot,
there is no case or controversy.

55:25.393 --> 55:27.428
- Class action, wasn't it?
- Yes,

55:27.462 --> 55:29.296
but the whole purpose
of class action

55:29.330 --> 55:32.199
is to have a representative
in court.

55:32.232 --> 55:34.769
So, what procedure
would you suggest

55:34.802 --> 55:38.205
for any pregnant female
in the State of Texas

55:38.238 --> 55:42.010
to ever get
judicial consideration?

55:42.043 --> 55:43.478
We can take judicial notice

55:43.511 --> 55:45.647
of the fact
that at any given moment,

55:45.680 --> 55:49.550
there are unwed pregnant females
in the State of Texas.

55:52.219 --> 55:53.888
I think she makes her choice

55:53.921 --> 55:56.357
prior to the time
that she becomes pregnant.

55:56.391 --> 55:58.559
Maybe she makes her choice

55:58.593 --> 56:01.629
when she decides
to live in Texas.

56:10.538 --> 56:12.540
It should've been debated
in Congress, not here.

56:14.174 --> 56:15.977
"Courts are
the mere instruments of the law,

56:16.010 --> 56:17.478
and can will nothing."
John Marshall.

56:17.512 --> 56:18.880
Politicians
don't have the courage

56:18.913 --> 56:20.314
to argue with the legislature.

56:20.348 --> 56:21.416
The right to life

56:21.449 --> 56:22.583
is the cornerstone
of our government.

56:22.617 --> 56:24.385
It's a foundation
of the Constitution.

56:24.419 --> 56:27.588
They were mocking him in there.

56:27.622 --> 56:29.924
I don't even know why
this is in the Supreme Court.

56:29.957 --> 56:31.592
There's no factual record
in this case,

56:31.626 --> 56:33.661
no trial,
no expert witnesses,

56:33.695 --> 56:35.163
no description of evidence,

56:35.195 --> 56:37.197
no expert witness testimony.
It didn't even go through

56:37.230 --> 56:38.198
an appeal!

56:38.231 --> 56:39.434
This is a conspiracy.

56:39.467 --> 56:40.233
They're
laughin' at him in there!

56:40.267 --> 56:41.669
Laughin' at him!

56:41.703 --> 56:43.270
They're not laughin' with him.
They're laughin' at him!

56:43.304 --> 56:45.440
It couldn't have been that bad.

56:45.473 --> 56:47.341
You're a law professor.

56:47.375 --> 56:49.744
He didn't even address
the rights of the unborn

56:49.777 --> 56:51.846
in property law,
probate law,

56:51.879 --> 56:54.782
criminal law, tort law,
the list goes on.

56:54.816 --> 56:58.519
The judges ask him what rights,
if any, do the unborn have,

56:58.553 --> 57:01.288
and he just stood there
and didn't say anything.

57:01.322 --> 57:03.124
I gotta go
before I blow a gasket!

57:06.494 --> 57:08.863
There's no more discussion
for...?

57:08.896 --> 57:10.431
For Roe?

57:12.467 --> 57:13.801
<i>The four justices on the right</i>

57:13.835 --> 57:15.636
<i>with their hands up</i>

57:15.670 --> 57:19.440
<i>voted to legalize abortion,
while the three on the left,</i>

57:19.474 --> 57:23.911
<i>including Chief Justice Burger,
were supporting life.</i>

57:23.945 --> 57:27.181
<i>This made it four to three
in favor of abortion.</i>

57:40.094 --> 57:42.063
Apologize, gentlemen.

57:42.096 --> 57:44.132
In the matter of Roe v. Wade,

57:44.165 --> 57:47.001
I want the case reargued.

57:47.034 --> 57:48.402
<i>Chief Justice Burger was losing,</i>

57:48.436 --> 57:50.171
<i>so he wanted the case reheard</i>

57:50.204 --> 57:53.741
<i>to flip the vote
in favor of life.</i>

57:53.775 --> 57:54.742
Well, besides the obvious,

57:54.776 --> 57:56.077
what's your reasoning?

57:56.110 --> 57:57.111
Four to three in favor of Roe,

57:57.145 --> 57:58.513
it's very close.

57:58.546 --> 57:59.914
We've had
close decisions before.

57:59.947 --> 58:01.249
Because
it didn't go Warren's way.

58:01.281 --> 58:02.583
That has nothing to do with it.

58:02.617 --> 58:03.684
The importance of this issue

58:03.718 --> 58:06.320
merits a full bench treatment.

58:06.354 --> 58:07.355
Of course, Harry.

58:07.388 --> 58:08.456
Because you're Warren's man.

58:08.489 --> 58:09.791
I resent that.

58:09.824 --> 58:11.626
You were
best man at his wedding.

58:11.659 --> 58:14.294
It was my idea to reargue
in the first place.

58:14.328 --> 58:18.032
Harry, you're here because
he recommended you to Nixon.

58:18.065 --> 58:20.201
Enough! We need to wait!

58:20.234 --> 58:21.836
And why is that?
Because this decision

58:21.869 --> 58:24.672
might affect your old pal
Nixon's re-election?

58:24.705 --> 58:27.141
Really, Potter?

58:27.175 --> 58:29.977
Can we rest the egos

58:30.011 --> 58:32.313
and try to get a little work
done, please?

58:32.346 --> 58:34.682
Does anyone else
have an opinion on this?

58:34.715 --> 58:35.850
Yes, I don't see any problem

58:35.883 --> 58:37.051
with rearguing.

58:37.084 --> 58:38.553
Nixon opposes abortion,

58:38.586 --> 58:41.289
so I'm sure his new justices
will follow suit.

58:41.322 --> 58:43.291
Two new justices
voting Nixon's way

58:43.324 --> 58:44.659
will change the outcome here.

58:44.692 --> 58:46.394
Political allegiance
should not affect

58:46.427 --> 58:49.063
how we interpret
the Constitution, gentlemen.

58:49.096 --> 58:50.331
Yes, and with that,

58:50.364 --> 58:52.400
I'm appointing Harry
to pen the opinion.

58:52.433 --> 58:54.635
I'm the senior justice
in the majority.

58:54.669 --> 58:56.704
I've got to agree
with Bill, Warren.

58:56.737 --> 58:58.506
- That's not standard protocol.
- I'm the chief justice.

58:58.539 --> 58:59.841
I determine protocol.

58:59.874 --> 59:02.543
You are trying to control this,
Warren, old buddy.

59:02.577 --> 59:04.245
That is completely unethical.

59:04.278 --> 59:05.880
Aren't you the one
that pushed this case?

59:08.749 --> 59:10.384
All those in favor of rearguing?

59:12.553 --> 59:13.588
<i>They voted six to one</i>

59:13.621 --> 59:16.357
<i>to reargue Roe v. Wade.</i>

59:16.390 --> 59:19.827
There you go. That's it.

59:19.861 --> 59:21.929
<i>Justice Douglas was the only one</i>

59:21.963 --> 59:23.731
<i>to oppose
hearing the case again.</i>

59:30.271 --> 59:31.639
- William?
- Hmm.

59:32.740 --> 59:33.875
Bill.

59:41.148 --> 59:42.683
It's a letter of protest

59:42.717 --> 59:45.019
including my draft
dissent to reargue.

59:45.052 --> 59:46.520
<i>The draft dissent</i>

59:46.554 --> 59:49.957
<i>is a formal letter that outlines
Justice Douglas' reasons</i>

59:49.991 --> 59:54.962
<i>as to why he thought Roe v. Wade
should not be reheard.</i>

59:54.996 --> 59:56.430
And why are you
giving this to me?

59:58.399 --> 1:00:01.402
Burger abused his power.

1:00:01.435 --> 1:00:03.070
I'm the senior justice
after him,

1:00:03.104 --> 1:00:05.406
he was supposed to
assign the case to me.

1:00:05.439 --> 1:00:07.909
That's already been decided,
okay?

1:00:07.942 --> 1:00:09.410
Get off that.

1:00:09.443 --> 1:00:10.444
Chief Justice
is going to make sure

1:00:10.478 --> 1:00:12.079
that we reargue this case.

1:00:12.113 --> 1:00:15.750
The Senate just confirmed
Rehnquist and Powell.

1:00:15.783 --> 1:00:18.052
That will flip the decision.

1:00:18.085 --> 1:00:19.120
<i>You see, Justice Douglas</i>

1:00:19.153 --> 1:00:21.055
<i>supported Jane Roe,</i>

1:00:21.088 --> 1:00:23.291
<i>and right now, the vote
was four to three</i>

1:00:23.325 --> 1:00:25.493
<i>in his favor to win.</i>

1:00:25.526 --> 1:00:28.462
<i>He was afraid if there was
gonna be a reargument</i>

1:00:28.496 --> 1:00:32.099
<i>with two new justices,
the vote would flip</i>

1:00:32.133 --> 1:00:34.702
<i>and it would be five-four,
and he would lose.</i>

1:00:40.474 --> 1:00:42.176
Has Burger seen this?

1:00:42.209 --> 1:00:43.678
Not yet.

1:00:46.381 --> 1:00:48.417
You cannot
send this letter to the press.

1:00:48.449 --> 1:00:49.784
Promise me
you're voting with us.

1:00:49.817 --> 1:00:51.152
How dare you!

1:00:51.185 --> 1:00:53.587
Promise me now, or this is
going to be published.

1:00:53.621 --> 1:00:55.289
You will disgrace the court.

1:00:55.324 --> 1:00:57.258
If you don't wanna see that
in the Post,

1:00:57.291 --> 1:00:58.960
you need to assure me
that a reargument

1:00:58.993 --> 1:01:00.728
will not change your vote.

1:01:19.513 --> 1:01:21.482
You need to
make an issue of this.

1:01:21.515 --> 1:01:23.352
I don't
understand how a single justice

1:01:23.385 --> 1:01:25.186
can order things his way.

1:01:25.219 --> 1:01:26.988
Now you know how women feel.

1:01:27.021 --> 1:01:28.656
I'm late, I have to
get to the clinic.

1:01:28.689 --> 1:01:30.958
I wish you wouldn't spend
so much time at that place.

1:01:30.992 --> 1:01:32.159
That place?

1:01:32.193 --> 1:01:33.395
Planned Parenthood?

1:01:33.428 --> 1:01:34.996
You don't want us
supporting women?

1:01:37.098 --> 1:01:38.666
We'll talk about it later.

1:01:38.699 --> 1:01:39.867
Okay.

1:01:39.900 --> 1:01:41.336
- Andy.
- William.

1:01:41.370 --> 1:01:42.703
- You're looking lovely.
- Thank you.

1:01:46.441 --> 1:01:47.842
Planned Parenthood?

1:01:47.875 --> 1:01:49.877
<i>Planned Parenthood?</i>

1:01:49.910 --> 1:01:53.382
<i>Nobody knew Justice Stewart's
wife worked there.</i>

1:01:53.415 --> 1:01:55.317
You need to recuse yourself.

1:01:55.350 --> 1:01:56.650
Look, Bill.

1:01:56.684 --> 1:01:58.586
My wife volunteers there,
not me.

1:01:58.619 --> 1:02:00.389
This is a major
conflict of interest.

1:02:00.422 --> 1:02:02.690
If word got out.

1:02:02.723 --> 1:02:04.925
Please, you need to
control your home.

1:02:04.959 --> 1:02:07.194
What Burger did was worse.

1:02:07.228 --> 1:02:08.763
He appointed Harry
to write the opinion.

1:02:08.796 --> 1:02:11.198
That is a gross
abandonment of protocol.

1:02:11.232 --> 1:02:13.034
We were ready
to vote this four-three.

1:02:15.636 --> 1:02:18.373
Potter,
here's my letter and dissent.

1:02:18.407 --> 1:02:19.940
You know what I resent?

1:02:19.974 --> 1:02:21.776
I resent the fact
that Burger thinks

1:02:21.809 --> 1:02:24.078
he has Rehnquist and Powell
in his pocket.

1:02:24.111 --> 1:02:25.880
They're brand new,

1:02:25.913 --> 1:02:27.681
and Burger acts
like he owns the court.

1:02:27.715 --> 1:02:30.117
But he has no right to
hold this up for those two.

1:02:30.151 --> 1:02:32.553
He wants to make sure
the vote goes his way,

1:02:32.586 --> 1:02:34.688
that's why he's
demanding a reargument.

1:02:34.722 --> 1:02:36.090
Right.
And that will flip the vote

1:02:36.123 --> 1:02:37.725
and we lose five-four.

1:02:37.758 --> 1:02:41.095
If we don't sort this out,
fur will fly today.

1:02:56.445 --> 1:02:57.978
<i>You see, in the end,</i>

1:02:58.012 --> 1:03:00.415
<i>it was Justice Stewart who
leaked the court's internal vote</i>

1:03:00.449 --> 1:03:02.049
<i>to the</i> Washington Post.

1:03:02.083 --> 1:03:04.553
<i>He wanted to stop the case
from being reheard</i>

1:03:04.585 --> 1:03:07.254
<i>because he wanted abortion
legalized.</i>

1:03:07.288 --> 1:03:09.123
So, Judge, how's the wife?

1:03:09.156 --> 1:03:11.292
Cut the small talk, Bob.

1:03:11.326 --> 1:03:13.462
Look, I understand
your wife was a volunteer

1:03:13.495 --> 1:03:16.130
for Planned Parenthood.
Is that why we're here?

1:03:16.163 --> 1:03:17.832
Absolutely not.

1:03:17.865 --> 1:03:20.167
All my decisions have to do
with law and the Constitution.

1:03:20.201 --> 1:03:21.702
Now, let's get this over with.

1:03:28.709 --> 1:03:30.644
Are you sure you want to
give this to me?

1:03:30.678 --> 1:03:31.946
Burger is gonna hit the roof

1:03:31.979 --> 1:03:34.014
when he sees this
on the front page of the Post.

1:03:34.048 --> 1:03:35.983
Yeah, well, he deserves it.

1:03:52.700 --> 1:03:54.935
I wish
you hadn't given me this case.

1:03:54.969 --> 1:03:56.471
Have you-have
you seen the Post this morning?

1:03:56.505 --> 1:03:58.772
I saw it.

1:03:58.806 --> 1:04:00.575
- I saw it!
- Now everyone knows how I voted.

1:04:02.243 --> 1:04:03.878
The media
is outrageous.

1:04:03.911 --> 1:04:06.348
Media? There's a leak!

1:04:06.381 --> 1:04:08.583
The appetite for this nonsense
is only worse.

1:04:10.217 --> 1:04:11.986
How long we been friends?

1:04:12.019 --> 1:04:13.854
Dayton Bluff Elementary.

1:04:15.890 --> 1:04:17.158
It wasn't you, was it?

1:04:22.330 --> 1:04:23.264
I'm sorry.

1:04:25.099 --> 1:04:26.734
I'm out of sorts.

1:04:26.767 --> 1:04:31.839
My family, my own family,
is up in arms about my vote.

1:04:31.872 --> 1:04:32.973
They've been
watching television.

1:04:33.007 --> 1:04:35.943
I don't-I don't know
what to do, Harry.

1:04:42.850 --> 1:04:46.754
Warren.
I question my competency.

1:04:48.523 --> 1:04:49.558
Don't.

1:04:52.927 --> 1:04:55.930
Your decade of counsel
with the Mayo Clinic,

1:04:57.365 --> 1:04:59.501
it will be very helpful here.

1:04:59.534 --> 1:05:02.236
I've only been here a year.

1:05:02.269 --> 1:05:05.072
We gotta control this, Harry.

1:05:05.105 --> 1:05:06.441
It's gotten out of hand.

1:05:06.474 --> 1:05:07.775
Do you know
what they're calling me?

1:05:09.311 --> 1:05:10.778
Your boy.

1:05:10.811 --> 1:05:16.351
They are calling me your boy,
the Minnesota Twin.

1:05:16.384 --> 1:05:19.753
I trust you, Harry,
and I need your help.

1:05:19.787 --> 1:05:21.255
I need your support here.

1:05:27.962 --> 1:05:29.964
I'm on the fence.

1:05:29.997 --> 1:05:31.732
Harry, with all this
public pressure,

1:05:31.765 --> 1:05:33.067
we've got to get this right.

1:05:33.100 --> 1:05:35.970
We're going to be
remembered for this.

1:05:36.003 --> 1:05:37.639
Perhaps this is
beyond the authority

1:05:37.672 --> 1:05:39.073
of the Supreme Court.

1:05:41.175 --> 1:05:43.811
We are the law
of the land, Harry.

1:05:46.247 --> 1:05:47.915
We are the law of the land.

1:05:53.488 --> 1:05:56.056
<i>Abortion
was still illegal in Texas.</i>

1:05:56.090 --> 1:05:59.093
<i>So, every Friday, the flight
from Dallas to El Paso</i>

1:05:59.126 --> 1:06:00.294
<i>was booked solid.</i>

1:06:00.328 --> 1:06:01.329
<i>They landed</i>

1:06:01.363 --> 1:06:02.597
<i>and crossed the border.</i>

1:06:02.631 --> 1:06:04.999
<i>It was called
the Abortion Flight.</i>

1:06:05.032 --> 1:06:06.568
<i>Planned Parenthood and NARAL</i>

1:06:06.601 --> 1:06:08.670
<i>fundraised
at the Playboy Mansion.</i>

1:06:08.703 --> 1:06:10.338
<i>I mean, it's kind of
hypocritical</i>

1:06:10.372 --> 1:06:11.640
<i>that we exploited women</i>

1:06:11.673 --> 1:06:13.240
<i>for women's rights,</i>

1:06:13.274 --> 1:06:15.677
<i>but hey, anything
for a good cause.</i>

1:06:18.613 --> 1:06:20.114
<i>Larry and I were on a roll.</i>

1:06:20.147 --> 1:06:22.617
<i>We were performing
200 abortions a day,</i>

1:06:22.651 --> 1:06:25.152
<i>which was making
my clinic 50 grand.</i>

1:06:25.185 --> 1:06:28.155
<i>Today, that would be like
half a million a week.</i>

1:06:37.666 --> 1:06:41.035
And that's how
I became a published author.

1:06:41.068 --> 1:06:42.604
That's so far out.

1:06:42.637 --> 1:06:43.871
You know,
Larry here changed the laws

1:06:43.904 --> 1:06:46.140
in half the country,
singlehandedly.

1:06:46.173 --> 1:06:48.476
Bernie and I own
most of the clinics in New York.

1:06:48.510 --> 1:06:50.210
Oh, my god. That's sick.

1:06:50.244 --> 1:06:51.613
And how did you do that?

1:06:51.646 --> 1:06:53.180
We control the media.

1:06:53.213 --> 1:06:55.015
Get real.

1:06:55.049 --> 1:06:56.116
We do.

1:06:56.150 --> 1:06:57.951
They write
whatever we tell them.

1:06:57.985 --> 1:07:00.187
This one time,
we got the <i>New York Times</i>

1:07:00.220 --> 1:07:01.489
to publish a poll

1:07:01.523 --> 1:07:04.659
on how many doctors
were in favor of abortion.

1:07:04.693 --> 1:07:06.795
We said 87% sounded good.

1:07:06.827 --> 1:07:09.497
How many doctors again
was that out of, Larry?

1:07:09.531 --> 1:07:11.165
About 40,000, I think.

1:07:11.198 --> 1:07:13.200
Can you believe
they printed that?

1:07:13.233 --> 1:07:14.636
And then, we got them to say

1:07:14.669 --> 1:07:18.473
that 60% of Americans
favored abortion.

1:07:18.506 --> 1:07:20.841
Why didn't you guys
just do a real poll?

1:07:20.874 --> 1:07:23.143
<i>Because
if a real poll was taken,</i>

1:07:23.177 --> 1:07:26.914
<i>nowhere near 60% of Americans
favored abortion.</i>

1:07:26.947 --> 1:07:30.884
<i>So, we made it up, and the media
didn't even question it.</i>

1:07:30.918 --> 1:07:33.655
<i>This is a tactic
of the self-fulfilling lie.</i>

1:07:33.688 --> 1:07:37.057
<i>You see, few people
care to be in the minority.</i>

1:07:37.091 --> 1:07:38.992
There's nowhere near
a half a million women

1:07:39.026 --> 1:07:40.395
- are having back alley abortions.
- Yeah. You see,

1:07:40.428 --> 1:07:42.764
if you keep repeating
the big lie over and over again,

1:07:42.797 --> 1:07:45.032
it generally
convinces the public.

1:07:45.065 --> 1:07:47.369
Well, 10,000 women die
from back alley abortions.

1:07:49.103 --> 1:07:50.405
- What?
- Larry, wait.

1:07:50.438 --> 1:07:51.840
We made that up, too.

1:07:51.872 --> 1:07:54.007
Yeah, those are my statistics
I came up with.

1:07:54.041 --> 1:07:56.378
- Yeah!
- You guys lied?

1:07:56.411 --> 1:07:57.612
I wouldn't call it lying.

1:07:57.645 --> 1:07:58.780
Yeah, it was
for the greater good.

1:07:58.813 --> 1:08:01.583
Planned Parenthood,
they also helped.

1:08:02.817 --> 1:08:04.352
And no one found out?

1:08:04.386 --> 1:08:08.790
Found out?
Honey, the media was in on it.

1:08:08.823 --> 1:08:11.793
You see, for example,
if you check out <i>Time Magazine,</i>

1:08:11.826 --> 1:08:14.362
we planted four
pro-abortion stories

1:08:14.396 --> 1:08:15.463
every year.

1:08:15.497 --> 1:08:19.434
So, 1969, and we have it in

1:08:19.467 --> 1:08:21.235
March, September,
two in November.

1:08:21.268 --> 1:08:24.572
In 1970, February,
March, April, September,

1:08:24.606 --> 1:08:27.274
in '71, March, May,
September, November,

1:08:27.308 --> 1:08:28.309
and so on and so forth.

1:08:28.343 --> 1:08:29.910
We kept doing it.

1:08:29.943 --> 1:08:32.146
We also put pro-abortion
stories in TV shows and films.

1:08:32.179 --> 1:08:33.548
Yeah, remember that movie...

1:08:33.581 --> 1:08:35.884
oh, what was it...
<i>Cabaret</i> with Liza Minelli?

1:08:35.916 --> 1:08:37.251
Yes.

1:08:37.284 --> 1:08:42.624
Okay, wait!
<i>Time Magazine.</i> Really?

1:08:42.657 --> 1:08:44.191
And how did you guys do that?

1:08:45.693 --> 1:08:47.662
We used each other as sources.

1:09:00.809 --> 1:09:02.477
Should we really be
doing this on Mother's Day?

1:09:02.510 --> 1:09:04.111
Exactly.

1:09:04.144 --> 1:09:05.045
All right.

1:09:09.784 --> 1:09:11.653
How's the rally going, bubalah?

1:09:12.821 --> 1:09:14.589
Yeah, hi.

1:09:14.622 --> 1:09:16.290
<i>Larry got
commissions by referring women</i>

1:09:16.324 --> 1:09:18.860
<i>to abortionists
all over the country.</i>

1:09:18.893 --> 1:09:22.296
<i>In Chicago, he even used rabbis
and Protestant clergy</i>

1:09:22.330 --> 1:09:24.466
<i>to help find them doctors.</i>

1:09:24.499 --> 1:09:26.200
Is my referral there?

1:09:26.233 --> 1:09:28.369
With me, as we speak.

1:09:29.804 --> 1:09:31.171
Okay, good.

1:09:35.008 --> 1:09:36.344
Yeah, I gotta run.

1:09:37.512 --> 1:09:39.213
Such a good guy, that Larry,

1:09:39.246 --> 1:09:41.649
making sure
the two of you are okay.

1:09:42.851 --> 1:09:45.219
I really need to
get this done soon.

1:09:45.252 --> 1:09:47.555
I-I recommend
going to New York.

1:09:47.589 --> 1:09:51.559
Larry's partner Bernie,
he's terrific.

1:09:51.593 --> 1:09:54.161
You don't have anyone
in Chicago?

1:09:54.194 --> 1:09:57.332
I can't leave.
What do I tell my husband?

1:09:57.365 --> 1:09:58.566
Oh, jeez.

1:09:58.600 --> 1:10:00.735
Oy vey,
you're not the husband?

1:10:01.903 --> 1:10:03.605
You know it's not legal here.

1:10:04.772 --> 1:10:07.575
Please, Rabbi, I-I beg you.

1:10:07.609 --> 1:10:08.810
Don't cry, don't cry.

1:10:08.843 --> 1:10:12.145
It's okay. It's okay.
Go see Dr. Ketchum.

1:10:12.179 --> 1:10:14.147
He's not bad.

1:10:14.181 --> 1:10:15.683
And we're not
gonna get in trouble?

1:10:15.717 --> 1:10:18.553
Oh, boychik,
I take care of everything.

1:10:19.888 --> 1:10:20.788
Okay.

1:10:22.022 --> 1:10:24.057
Thank you.

1:10:24.091 --> 1:10:26.594
Dozens write
amicus briefs, and we get four.

1:10:27.862 --> 1:10:29.229
They lied to Rockefeller

1:10:29.263 --> 1:10:30.899
about the numbers on abortion,

1:10:30.932 --> 1:10:33.200
and New York fell
just like that.

1:10:33.233 --> 1:10:35.904
When you see
a kid out of law school

1:10:35.937 --> 1:10:38.406
get to argue to
the highest court in Texas,

1:10:38.439 --> 1:10:40.842
and you can't get
a job promotion.

1:10:40.875 --> 1:10:42.944
I could have become
a cause célèbre

1:10:42.977 --> 1:10:45.380
if I had taken it up to court,

1:10:45.413 --> 1:10:48.215
but it's about knowing
the price of the game.

1:10:48.248 --> 1:10:50.852
I wouldn't have waited
20 years; I'd have sued them.

1:10:50.885 --> 1:10:54.689
It will be easier
for those coming behind me.

1:10:54.722 --> 1:10:57.224
You don't always
have to be so strong.

1:10:57.257 --> 1:10:59.126
It's not really fair.

1:10:59.159 --> 1:11:01.194
Life isn't fair.

1:11:01.228 --> 1:11:03.565
It doesn't mean I condone it.

1:11:03.598 --> 1:11:06.266
When given a choice of being
kind or right, be kind.

1:11:08.002 --> 1:11:09.136
You can be angry, Mildred.

1:11:11.606 --> 1:11:14.042
You certainly
have been a role model.

1:11:16.945 --> 1:11:18.780
Planned Parenthood
and Larry Lader

1:11:18.813 --> 1:11:21.482
are running seminars to set up
clinics across the country.

1:11:21.516 --> 1:11:23.116
And not to mention Nathanson.

1:11:23.150 --> 1:11:25.787
Oh. Maybe I should
pay him a visit,

1:11:25.820 --> 1:11:27.154
doctor to doctor.

1:11:27.187 --> 1:11:28.590
Good luck with that.

1:11:28.623 --> 1:11:30.123
They're making too much money
off these clinics.

1:11:30.157 --> 1:11:31.726
Not to mention the illegal ones.

1:11:31.759 --> 1:11:33.328
We have to be willing
to get arrested

1:11:33.361 --> 1:11:35.463
for our beliefs
just like they are.

1:11:35.496 --> 1:11:37.799
Illegal abortion houses,
that's class warfare.

1:11:41.536 --> 1:11:43.771
I'll reach out to the DAs
across the country.

1:11:45.039 --> 1:11:45.974
What are you thinking?

1:11:48.275 --> 1:11:49.344
Let's see just how many times

1:11:49.377 --> 1:11:51.111
they're really willing
to get arrested.

1:12:01.723 --> 1:12:03.358
Come on. Let's go.

1:12:03.391 --> 1:12:05.093
<i>We had secret abortion clinics</i>

1:12:05.158 --> 1:12:06.761
- <i>across the country,</i>
- Get in here.

1:12:06.794 --> 1:12:08.863
<i>for girls
who couldn't get to New York.</i>

1:12:08.896 --> 1:12:11.799
<i>Part of our referral network
consisted of rabbis</i>

1:12:11.833 --> 1:12:15.268
<i>and Protestant clergy
that helped set them up.</i>

1:12:15.302 --> 1:12:17.872
<i>Sometimes, we even used
five-star hotels.</i>

1:12:43.031 --> 1:12:44.132
Freeze!

1:12:44.164 --> 1:12:46.166
Hands in the air
where I can see them.

1:12:46.199 --> 1:12:47.568
This is the one.
Right here, guys, right here.

1:12:48.870 --> 1:12:49.871
Chicago PD!

1:12:49.904 --> 1:12:50.972
Put your gun down.

1:12:51.005 --> 1:12:52.340
Hey, watch it!

1:12:52.373 --> 1:12:54.375
Stop right there!

1:12:54.409 --> 1:12:56.176
Where do you think you're going?

1:12:56.209 --> 1:12:59.212
He thinks
he can get out the window.

1:12:59.246 --> 1:13:00.515
Stop what you're doing.

1:13:00.548 --> 1:13:01.516
Can you cuff him, please.

1:13:01.549 --> 1:13:03.017
Hey, stop
what you're doing, Pops.

1:13:03.051 --> 1:13:05.720
This is an operating room!
You have no authority here!

1:13:10.458 --> 1:13:12.225
Are you okay?

1:13:18.433 --> 1:13:20.300
Oh, my god.

1:13:30.144 --> 1:13:32.580
<i>The rabbis
and pastors getting arrested</i>

1:13:32.613 --> 1:13:34.949
<i>brought down one of our
biggest referral networks.</i>

1:13:40.421 --> 1:13:41.656
Is everything okay?

1:13:43.256 --> 1:13:45.593
I just hope what we're doing
is making women feel safer.

1:13:48.629 --> 1:13:50.398
You should be so proud.

1:13:50.431 --> 1:13:52.533
A young woman is arguing

1:13:52.567 --> 1:13:55.536
in front of the Supreme Court
because of you.

1:13:55.570 --> 1:13:56.938
I thought
I would have had envy,

1:13:56.971 --> 1:14:02.543
but all I felt after all of it
was proud of Sarah,

1:14:02.577 --> 1:14:04.645
and hope this will open the gate
for women to come.

1:14:08.248 --> 1:14:10.485
One of our clinics
was just busted.

1:14:10.518 --> 1:14:12.220
Ugh.

1:14:12.252 --> 1:14:14.989
Sixteen clergy,
four rabbis, all arrested.

1:14:15.022 --> 1:14:16.791
We have to protect these kids.

1:14:16.824 --> 1:14:19.494
We have to make sure
they have safe doctors.

1:14:19.527 --> 1:14:22.130
These raids can't be setbacks.

1:14:22.163 --> 1:14:25.767
We have to keep working
for abortion on demand.

1:14:25.800 --> 1:14:27.769
It makes us look like
we're in it for the money.

1:14:27.802 --> 1:14:28.803
It's just disgraceful.

1:14:28.836 --> 1:14:30.972
No, quit exaggerating, Bernie.

1:14:31.005 --> 1:14:32.406
You know what it's gonna do
to me and my family

1:14:32.440 --> 1:14:35.109
- and my reputation?
- Oh, this is-this is about you?

1:14:35.143 --> 1:14:37.478
Bernie? Is this about you
and the money?

1:14:37.512 --> 1:14:38.613
It's not about me.

1:14:40.014 --> 1:14:41.215
It's about the girls.

1:14:42.617 --> 1:14:43.851
You're not there.

1:14:43.885 --> 1:14:45.653
Yeah, okay.
Quit exaggerating, Bernie.

1:14:47.622 --> 1:14:49.557
You don't see
all the girls I save.

1:14:59.333 --> 1:15:00.835
I became a physician

1:15:00.868 --> 1:15:03.037
in the tradition
that obliges society

1:15:03.070 --> 1:15:05.640
to expect a doctor
to save lives,

1:15:05.673 --> 1:15:07.175
not kill them.

1:15:07.208 --> 1:15:09.210
There goes your
Hippocratic oath.

1:15:09.243 --> 1:15:12.313
Tell that to Nathanson, Mother.

1:15:12.346 --> 1:15:17.985
Dr. King said, "We cannot win
if we're willing to sacrifice

1:15:18.019 --> 1:15:20.188
the futures of our children

1:15:20.221 --> 1:15:22.690
for immediate personal
comfort and safety."

1:15:22.723 --> 1:15:24.992
I am not willing to allow

1:15:25.026 --> 1:15:28.563
the concept
of expendable human lives

1:15:28.596 --> 1:15:30.998
to turn this land of ours

1:15:31.032 --> 1:15:34.402
into just another
exclusive reservation,

1:15:34.435 --> 1:15:35.803
where only the planned,

1:15:35.837 --> 1:15:38.039
the privileged, and the perfect

1:15:38.072 --> 1:15:39.507
have the right to live.

1:15:39.540 --> 1:15:41.042
<i>my saying this to you,</i>

1:15:41.075 --> 1:15:42.510
<i>we're free.</i>

1:15:42.543 --> 1:15:44.679
<i>We finally have the right
to decide what we can do</i>

1:15:44.712 --> 1:15:46.013
<i>with our own body.</i>

1:15:46.047 --> 1:15:47.348
<i>All right.
Then, will you please get yours</i>

1:15:47.381 --> 1:15:48.382
<i>into the kitchen.</i>

1:15:50.051 --> 1:15:52.720
- You're just scared.
- I am not scared!

1:15:52.753 --> 1:15:55.723
You are, and it's as simple as
gong to the dentist.

1:15:57.391 --> 1:16:00.394
As simple as
going to the dentist?

1:16:00.428 --> 1:16:06.067
Oh.
I scream, they scream louder.

1:16:06.100 --> 1:16:09.338
We raise money,
they raise more.

1:16:09.370 --> 1:16:11.572
They have Hollywood
on their side.

1:16:11.606 --> 1:16:17.411
Dr. Nathanson, I heard he gave
them $10,000 to air that.

1:16:19.747 --> 1:16:23.284
<i>Lewis Powell is from Virginia.</i>

1:16:23.318 --> 1:16:25.686
<i>But like another
great Virginian,</i>

1:16:25.720 --> 1:16:30.224
<i>Chief Justice Marshall,
Lewis Powell is recognized</i>

1:16:30.258 --> 1:16:32.293
<i>by his legal colleagues
throughout the nation</i>

1:16:32.327 --> 1:16:35.129
<i>as being a man
who represents not just</i>

1:16:35.162 --> 1:16:37.732
<i>Virginia and the South.</i>

1:16:37.765 --> 1:16:41.936
<i>He is first and foremost,
a very great American.</i>

1:16:44.672 --> 1:16:46.607
<i>William Rehnquist</i>

1:16:46.641 --> 1:16:49.076
<i>has been outstanding
in every intellectual endeavor</i>

1:16:49.110 --> 1:16:51.112
<i>he has undertaken.</i>

1:16:51.145 --> 1:16:53.581
<i>He was graduated
from Stanford University,</i>

1:16:53.614 --> 1:16:56.217
<i>Phi Beta Kappa, 1948.</i>

1:16:56.250 --> 1:16:57.251
<i>He graduated</i>

1:16:57.285 --> 1:16:59.153
<i>first in his class</i>

1:16:59.186 --> 1:17:01.589
<i>from the Stanford University
Law School in 1942.</i>

1:17:05.259 --> 1:17:06.527
You missed
the more important news!

1:17:07.695 --> 1:17:08.829
We got the majority.

1:17:10.131 --> 1:17:11.899
We're gonna win.

1:17:11.933 --> 1:17:13.901
<i>The two new
justices were conservatives.</i>

1:17:13.935 --> 1:17:15.636
<i>So, when we go back into court,</i>

1:17:15.670 --> 1:17:18.606
<i>the vote will swing their way
five to four.</i>

1:17:18.639 --> 1:17:20.141
<i>We're gonna lose.</i>

1:17:21.642 --> 1:17:22.877
I wouldn't count on that.

1:17:24.545 --> 1:17:27.281
We still have
a lot of work to do.

1:17:27.316 --> 1:17:32.586
I've tried Nathanson's service.
He won't return my calls.

1:17:32.620 --> 1:17:35.623
Have you tried heading over
to Planned Parenthood?

1:17:35.656 --> 1:17:38.092
I'm not going there
to get lynched.

1:17:38.125 --> 1:17:39.794
I'll just head over
to the hospital.

1:17:40.895 --> 1:17:42.997
Are you going to go
after the clergy?

1:17:43.030 --> 1:17:45.099
I'm gonna go with the industry.

1:17:45.132 --> 1:17:47.868
Robert,
no one sees the industry.

1:17:47.902 --> 1:17:49.036
It's invisible.

1:17:49.070 --> 1:17:51.306
The cause is hopeless
in secular terms.

1:17:51.340 --> 1:17:52.374
The effort is only worth it

1:17:52.407 --> 1:17:54.008
if it's part of
a larger enterprise:

1:17:54.041 --> 1:17:55.776
the reconversion of this nation.

1:17:55.810 --> 1:17:56.944
To what?

1:17:56.978 --> 1:17:59.381
Faith in God,
respect for His law.

1:17:59.414 --> 1:18:00.815
That law being?

1:18:00.848 --> 1:18:03.718
Human law, which cannot
tolerate the intentional killing

1:18:03.751 --> 1:18:05.454
of innocent human beings.

1:18:05.486 --> 1:18:07.054
Yeah, but the separation
of church and state

1:18:07.088 --> 1:18:08.357
is in the Constitution.

1:18:08.390 --> 1:18:10.291
That's a common misconception.

1:18:10.325 --> 1:18:11.959
The Constitution provides
freedom of religion,

1:18:11.993 --> 1:18:13.160
not separation.

1:18:14.495 --> 1:18:16.530
Our laws are based
in God's principle,

1:18:16.564 --> 1:18:18.065
"Thou shalt not kill."

1:18:18.099 --> 1:18:21.802
Ellen, you did a great job
organizing this.

1:18:21.836 --> 1:18:22.703
Thank you.

1:18:26.207 --> 1:18:29.043
The Ninth Amendment isn't
some bottomless pit of rights

1:18:29.076 --> 1:18:32.813
that we can abuse anytime
we find a case confuses us.

1:18:32.847 --> 1:18:34.515
What part of the Constitution

1:18:34.548 --> 1:18:38.919
says that a woman does not
have a right to an abortion?

1:18:38.953 --> 1:18:42.056
Freedom to choose - too vague.
Freedom to choose what?

1:18:42.089 --> 1:18:43.557
Prove medically
and scientifically

1:18:43.591 --> 1:18:46.594
that a new fetus is a-a someone.

1:18:46.627 --> 1:18:49.196
Even the doctors say
there is human life.

1:18:49.230 --> 1:18:51.565
Human life from
the moment of conception,

1:18:51.599 --> 1:18:53.267
in the embryonic state.

1:18:53.300 --> 1:18:56.338
Yeah, look.
You're new to the court,

1:18:56.371 --> 1:18:59.374
and Mrs. Weddington presents
a thought-out argument

1:18:59.408 --> 1:19:01.443
for women's rights.

1:19:01.476 --> 1:19:03.544
You've been watching
too much TV.

1:19:03.577 --> 1:19:06.714
This case has nothing to do
with women's rights.

1:19:06.747 --> 1:19:08.115
Does a woman, a mother,

1:19:08.149 --> 1:19:12.586
have the right to kill
her own child?

1:19:12.620 --> 1:19:14.423
I'll argue that case separately.

1:19:14.456 --> 1:19:16.425
It's not her child, just yet.

1:19:16.458 --> 1:19:17.792
Whose child is it?

1:19:17.825 --> 1:19:19.394
The mother's? Father's?
The state's?

1:19:20.928 --> 1:19:23.532
You've only just been appointed,

1:19:23.564 --> 1:19:26.233
and already you're playing into
the hands of public opinion.

1:19:27.668 --> 1:19:30.938
Byron, get off your high horse

1:19:30.971 --> 1:19:33.341
and make a constitutional
decision.

1:19:35.776 --> 1:19:38.245
I am making
a constitutional decision.

1:19:40.482 --> 1:19:42.317
She stated on several occasions

1:19:42.350 --> 1:19:44.386
that they are dismissing
the Hippocratic oath,

1:19:44.419 --> 1:19:45.820
the very oath

1:19:47.588 --> 1:19:50.758
that says doctors
need to protect life.

1:19:50.791 --> 1:19:53.794
It also states very clearly

1:19:53.828 --> 1:19:57.932
that a woman should not be given
an abortive remedy.

1:19:57.965 --> 1:20:00.134
That's what you're basing
your decision on,

1:20:00.167 --> 1:20:01.268
the Hippocratic oath.

1:20:02.837 --> 1:20:04.271
It's not 400 B.C.

1:20:05.840 --> 1:20:08.943
The 1948 Declaration of Geneva

1:20:08.976 --> 1:20:13.080
as well as the International
Code of Medical Ethics

1:20:13.114 --> 1:20:19.687
both clearly state
that doctors must protect life.

1:20:19.720 --> 1:20:22.123
From the point of conception.

1:20:22.156 --> 1:20:25.126
May I remind you, sir,

1:20:25.159 --> 1:20:27.928
you're on the United States
Supreme Court,

1:20:27.962 --> 1:20:30.164
not on an international
medical board.

1:20:32.032 --> 1:20:36.471
We have an opportunity here
to make things right.

1:20:36.505 --> 1:20:40.040
We have an opportunity here
to get things right.

1:20:40.074 --> 1:20:42.710
I fear if we vote in favor of

1:20:42.743 --> 1:20:44.613
removing the rights
of the fetus,

1:20:44.645 --> 1:20:48.149
that we are simply
blowing this whole thing.

1:20:48.182 --> 1:20:52.119
Hm-mm.
Roe isn't about right or wrong.

1:20:52.153 --> 1:20:54.121
It's about what's stated
in the law.

1:20:54.155 --> 1:20:59.727
All due respect, Justice,
if you don't realize that,

1:20:59.760 --> 1:21:03.864
you shouldn't be on the court.
Hm?

1:21:03.898 --> 1:21:07.835
Church and state are separate
for a reason.

1:21:07.868 --> 1:21:09.703
It's God's duty to forgive.

1:21:12.039 --> 1:21:15.343
It's ours to rule the law.

1:21:15.377 --> 1:21:22.350
This has nothing whatsoever
to do with church and state.

1:21:22.384 --> 1:21:25.052
This is strictly
a constitutional matter,

1:21:26.754 --> 1:21:29.457
life and liberty.

1:21:31.091 --> 1:21:32.293
Or have you forgotten that?

1:21:36.096 --> 1:21:37.365
Justice?

1:21:42.537 --> 1:21:44.673
Wade got Robert Flowers
to argue.

1:21:44.705 --> 1:21:46.474
He was handpicked
by the Texas attorney general.

1:21:48.142 --> 1:21:49.611
How you boys and gals doing?

1:21:51.111 --> 1:21:54.081
Have you seen how the whole
media supports Weddington?

1:21:54.114 --> 1:21:56.083
Well, we better
get to work then.

1:21:56.116 --> 1:21:59.119
I created a moot court
based on Griswald and Vuitch.

1:21:59.153 --> 1:22:01.922
We can set up and start
to fire questions.

1:22:01.956 --> 1:22:03.358
My boys don't need schooling

1:22:03.391 --> 1:22:06.293
by a bunch of kids
from New York City.

1:22:06.328 --> 1:22:07.294
It's going to be
you and your boys

1:22:07.329 --> 1:22:08.697
versus the whole country.

1:22:08.729 --> 1:22:11.700
Well, don't tell me,
I know the law!

1:22:11.732 --> 1:22:13.767
I know you do.
I'm worried.

1:22:15.604 --> 1:22:17.071
"The greatest act of faith
is when a man understands

1:22:17.104 --> 1:22:18.640
that he is not God."

1:22:18.673 --> 1:22:20.609
Oliver Wendell Holmes.

1:22:20.642 --> 1:22:22.910
It might be a good idea, Henry.

1:22:22.943 --> 1:22:24.011
I'm listening.

1:22:26.514 --> 1:22:27.649
What else you got for us, Bob?

1:22:29.250 --> 1:22:31.218
I filed with the court
to become guardian ad litem

1:22:31.252 --> 1:22:33.087
to all the unborn children
in the State of New York.

1:22:33.120 --> 1:22:35.323
How'd you manage that?

1:22:35.357 --> 1:22:36.790
The unborn has rights
in the area of the law

1:22:36.824 --> 1:22:38.627
from probate to criminal.

1:22:38.660 --> 1:22:40.995
In the Constitution, a person
cannot be deprived due process

1:22:41.028 --> 1:22:42.997
or denied equal protection.

1:22:43.030 --> 1:22:44.898
- Okay.
- So, the unborn have a right

1:22:44.932 --> 1:22:47.502
to an attorney just like
everybody else in America?

1:22:49.103 --> 1:22:50.572
It's brilliant!

1:22:50.605 --> 1:22:52.574
Larry, you convinced me
to open a clinic,

1:22:52.607 --> 1:22:54.643
abortion is illegal again
in New York.

1:22:54.676 --> 1:22:56.277
What are you talking about?

1:22:56.311 --> 1:22:58.779
I'm gonna lose everything
to that guardian of the unborn.

1:22:58.812 --> 1:22:59.947
I wouldn't worry about it.

1:22:59.980 --> 1:23:00.914
Guardian of the unborn,

1:23:00.948 --> 1:23:02.450
it sounds like a superhero.

1:23:02.484 --> 1:23:03.418
How can the Catholics

1:23:03.451 --> 1:23:05.286
use the court to make a law?

1:23:05.320 --> 1:23:07.589
Well, isn't
that what we're going to do?

1:23:07.622 --> 1:23:09.290
You boys are
only in favor of abortion

1:23:09.324 --> 1:23:12.059
because it's cheaper
than child support.

1:23:14.329 --> 1:23:15.630
Equality!

1:23:15.664 --> 1:23:16.765
Let's not forget,

1:23:16.797 --> 1:23:18.165
this is also about
population control.

1:23:18.198 --> 1:23:20.167
This is about women's rights.

1:23:21.469 --> 1:23:24.138
You're still in love
with Margaret Sanger!

1:23:24.171 --> 1:23:25.473
What are you talking about?

1:23:25.507 --> 1:23:28.976
She opposed abortion.
I read her autobiography.

1:23:29.009 --> 1:23:31.379
Oh, the founder of Planned
Parenthood opposed abortion?

1:23:31.413 --> 1:23:32.946
She'd be for it today.

1:23:32.980 --> 1:23:35.816
She said it was a disgrace
to our civilization.

1:23:35.849 --> 1:23:38.118
Quote, "There should be no
killing of babies in the womb,"

1:23:38.152 --> 1:23:39.853
end quote.

1:23:39.887 --> 1:23:41.356
I founded this movement.

1:23:41.389 --> 1:23:43.057
- This is about you?
- Yeah!

1:23:43.090 --> 1:23:45.527
This is about
the State of Larry Lader?

1:23:45.560 --> 1:23:47.529
Look around you.

1:23:47.562 --> 1:23:50.465
Who do you think is winning
your dirty little secret war?

1:23:50.498 --> 1:23:53.735
I am looking.
Look what I've created.

1:23:53.768 --> 1:23:55.035
Planned Parenthood
and half the doctors

1:23:55.069 --> 1:23:56.504
pay you referral fees.

1:23:56.538 --> 1:23:59.374
And you have the women
of the world to thank for that!

1:24:00.675 --> 1:24:02.276
And how much you getting
from your clinic, Doc?

1:24:05.112 --> 1:24:06.381
Equality!

1:24:17.625 --> 1:24:18.626
You haven't touched your food.

1:24:20.127 --> 1:24:21.061
Hm?

1:24:22.530 --> 1:24:27.234
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's this damn case.

1:24:27.267 --> 1:24:29.437
Well, which way are you
leaning towards, Dad?

1:24:29.471 --> 1:24:31.740
I'm not gonna
get into any of that.

1:24:31.773 --> 1:24:33.073
Good try.

1:24:33.107 --> 1:24:34.942
Sally's volunteering
at Planned Parenthood.

1:24:34.975 --> 1:24:36.845
Stop changing the subject.

1:24:36.877 --> 1:24:39.781
Oh, Planned Parenthood, that's-
that's great, sweetheart.

1:24:39.814 --> 1:24:41.516
<i>Now, that's the second justice</i>

1:24:41.549 --> 1:24:44.586
<i>with a family member
working for Planned Parenthood.</i>

1:24:44.619 --> 1:24:48.390
<i>First Stewart's wife,
and now Blackmun's daughter.</i>

1:24:48.423 --> 1:24:49.557
<i>Hm.</i>

1:24:49.591 --> 1:24:51.459
You know,
it's not only about abortion.

1:24:52.627 --> 1:24:53.795
Did you see 20,000 women

1:24:53.828 --> 1:24:55.563
marching for equality
in New York?

1:24:57.064 --> 1:24:58.867
Twenty thousand,
is that right?

1:24:58.899 --> 1:25:00.769
It's about time
we had our own rights.

1:25:03.838 --> 1:25:06.541
Do you want your daughter to be
able to become justice one day?

1:25:06.574 --> 1:25:07.675
Why...

1:25:09.143 --> 1:25:11.044
so you're saying

1:25:11.078 --> 1:25:14.449
if I vote the other way,
I'm voting against women?

1:25:14.482 --> 1:25:17.050
Yes, you are.

1:25:17.084 --> 1:25:20.254
Just listen to her, Dad.
Come on, it's important.

1:25:20.287 --> 1:25:21.656
I'm with the girls.

1:25:24.325 --> 1:25:25.693
Make us proud, Harry.

1:25:34.968 --> 1:25:36.103
I know why you gave me this

1:25:36.136 --> 1:25:38.473
but you should've let
Douglas write it.

1:25:38.506 --> 1:25:41.175
After my vote hit the media,

1:25:41.208 --> 1:25:43.812
my family
almost fell apart over it.

1:25:43.845 --> 1:25:46.079
So, you might be
changing your vote

1:25:46.113 --> 1:25:49.049
because your family found out?
Or was it the media?

1:25:52.554 --> 1:25:53.488
Warren.

1:25:57.692 --> 1:25:59.960
You wanted to talk.

1:25:59.993 --> 1:26:00.994
Yes, I did.

1:26:02.229 --> 1:26:04.031
I wanna see
where you stand, Harry.

1:26:04.064 --> 1:26:06.768
I'm hoping
we're on the same page.

1:26:06.801 --> 1:26:08.268
Byron, I don't know
what page I'm on.

1:26:08.302 --> 1:26:10.672
I'm not even sure we're
reading from the same book.

1:26:10.705 --> 1:26:14.375
I just-I'm trying to vote along
the lines of the Constitution.

1:26:14.409 --> 1:26:16.511
Does the Bill of Rights
allow a woman

1:26:16.544 --> 1:26:18.847
to kill her unborn child?

1:26:18.880 --> 1:26:20.180
It's a very simple question.

1:26:20.214 --> 1:26:21.549
No, it's not
a simple question.

1:26:21.583 --> 1:26:24.719
The question is,
when does a fetus become a life?

1:26:24.752 --> 1:26:26.955
At the point of conception,
Harry. When else?

1:26:26.987 --> 1:26:29.958
Well, that hasn't been
determined yet, has it?

1:26:29.990 --> 1:26:33.328
And if it had, we wouldn't be
having this conflict

1:26:33.361 --> 1:26:34.729
in our conversation.

1:26:34.762 --> 1:26:36.698
Sure, Bill. Why don't you
just sit down and join us.

1:26:36.731 --> 1:26:39.066
What we need to discuss
is the right to privacy.

1:26:39.099 --> 1:26:40.702
What?

1:26:40.735 --> 1:26:42.737
Listen, our job is to
interpret the Constitution.

1:26:42.770 --> 1:26:44.539
Our job is not to create law.

1:26:44.572 --> 1:26:46.975
If you wanna make a new law,
you take it up with Congress.

1:26:47.007 --> 1:26:49.511
We already ruled on that.
Griswold v. Connecticut.

1:26:49.544 --> 1:26:50.912
- Unrelated.
- Absolutely.

1:26:50.945 --> 1:26:52.480
- Unrelated.
- Absolutely.

1:26:52.514 --> 1:26:53.748
He-he's right.

1:26:53.781 --> 1:26:55.850
Right to privacy between
a patient and a doctor.

1:26:57.385 --> 1:27:00.522
At minimum, Byron,
it's something I think

1:27:00.555 --> 1:27:03.090
we should at least consider.

1:27:03.123 --> 1:27:05.326
You take this
into consideration, Harry,

1:27:05.360 --> 1:27:08.429
you take the risk
of embarrassing this court

1:27:08.463 --> 1:27:10.063
and putting it to a level
it has not been

1:27:10.097 --> 1:27:11.733
- since the Dred Scott decision.
- Oh, come on.

1:27:11.766 --> 1:27:13.935
Come on, Bill.
So, you wanna enslave women

1:27:13.968 --> 1:27:15.336
by denying them
their right to privacy.

1:27:15.370 --> 1:27:16.437
Is that it, Byron?

1:27:16.471 --> 1:27:17.438
That is not what I said.

1:27:17.472 --> 1:27:18.740
Well, that's what
you're implying.

1:27:18.773 --> 1:27:19.941
No, it is not what I'm implying.

1:27:19.974 --> 1:27:21.943
Wait, guys, guys.
Stop being so dramatic.

1:27:21.976 --> 1:27:24.512
And you, you're starting to
sound like one of Nixon's boys.

1:27:24.546 --> 1:27:27.247
Don't forget it was JFK
that appointed you.

1:27:27.281 --> 1:27:28.449
Yes, and it was Kennedy
that thought

1:27:28.483 --> 1:27:31.419
abortion was repugnant
to all Americans.

1:27:38.459 --> 1:27:39.727
Here we go again, boys.

1:27:48.268 --> 1:27:50.304
Certainly,
we cannot say that there is

1:27:50.338 --> 1:27:55.577
in the Constitution so stated
the right to an abortion.

1:27:55.610 --> 1:27:58.379
But neither is there stated
the right to travel

1:27:58.413 --> 1:28:01.716
or some other basic rights
that this court has held

1:28:01.749 --> 1:28:05.085
are under the United States
Constitution.

1:28:05.118 --> 1:28:06.988
I suppose that one of
the most important factors

1:28:07.021 --> 1:28:09.791
to consider is,
what rights, if any,

1:28:09.824 --> 1:28:11.726
does the unborn fetus have.

1:28:11.759 --> 1:28:12.961
That is correct.

1:28:12.994 --> 1:28:14.161
I have a question.

1:28:14.194 --> 1:28:16.464
Is it critical to your case
that the fetus

1:28:16.497 --> 1:28:20.501
not be considered a person
under the due process clause?

1:28:20.535 --> 1:28:22.102
It seems to me
that it is critical

1:28:22.135 --> 1:28:25.306
that we prove that this is
a fundamental interest

1:28:25.340 --> 1:28:27.240
on behalf of women.

1:28:27.274 --> 1:28:29.978
That it is a constitutional
right, second...

1:28:30.011 --> 1:28:35.115
Well, would you lose your case
if the fetus were a person?

1:28:35.148 --> 1:28:37.150
Then you would have
a balancing of interests.

1:28:38.953 --> 1:28:40.455
You're already
going to be balancing

1:28:40.488 --> 1:28:42.289
the interest of the mother

1:28:42.323 --> 1:28:45.192
against the interest
of the fetus.

1:28:45.225 --> 1:28:46.928
That is correct, Your Honor.

1:28:46.961 --> 1:28:49.097
If it were established
that the unborn fetus

1:28:49.129 --> 1:28:51.164
is protected
under the Constitution,

1:28:51.198 --> 1:28:53.668
you would have an impossible
case, Mrs. Weddington.

1:28:55.470 --> 1:28:57.839
I would have
a very difficult case.

1:29:01.509 --> 1:29:02.810
It's impossible for me to trace,

1:29:02.844 --> 1:29:04.345
within my allocated time,

1:29:04.379 --> 1:29:08.516
the development of a fetus
from the date of its conception

1:29:08.549 --> 1:29:10.183
to the date of its birth.

1:29:10.217 --> 1:29:12.219
But it's the position
of the State of Texas

1:29:12.252 --> 1:29:13.655
that upon conception,

1:29:13.688 --> 1:29:17.058
we have a human being.

1:29:17.091 --> 1:29:19.661
A person with the concept

1:29:19.694 --> 1:29:22.229
of the Constitution
of the United States

1:29:22.262 --> 1:29:24.197
and that of Texas as well.

1:29:24.231 --> 1:29:27.702
Any person born or naturalized
in the United States hasn't.

1:29:29.169 --> 1:29:32.239
No, that's not the definition
of a person,

1:29:32.272 --> 1:29:33.841
that's the definition
of a citizen.

1:29:33.875 --> 1:29:34.909
It's so fundamental

1:29:34.942 --> 1:29:36.577
that the framers
of the Constitution

1:29:36.611 --> 1:29:39.647
had not even set out
to define it.

1:29:39.681 --> 1:29:43.818
And even Blackstone
was quoted in 1765,

1:29:43.851 --> 1:29:47.155
"This right is inherent
in every individual

1:29:47.187 --> 1:29:50.758
and exists even before
the child is born."

1:29:50.792 --> 1:29:53.226
Is it not true

1:29:53.260 --> 1:29:57.432
or is it that the,
medical profession itself

1:29:57.465 --> 1:30:00.768
is not in agreement
as to when life begins?

1:30:00.802 --> 1:30:03.871
Medically speaking, we would
say that from the chromosomes,

1:30:03.905 --> 1:30:06.708
every potential of anybody
here in this room

1:30:06.741 --> 1:30:09.209
is present at the moment
of conception.

1:30:09.242 --> 1:30:12.880
Right. So, what you're speaking
about is a potential life.

1:30:12.914 --> 1:30:14.082
Yes, sir.

1:30:14.115 --> 1:30:17.351
With which
everyone can agree on.

1:30:17.385 --> 1:30:18.152
Just one moment.

1:30:20.488 --> 1:30:25.359
If you're correct
that the fetus is a person,

1:30:25.393 --> 1:30:28.463
then I suppose the state
would have a great trouble

1:30:28.496 --> 1:30:31.466
permitting an abortion,
wouldn't it?

1:30:31.499 --> 1:30:35.403
This court has been diligent

1:30:35.436 --> 1:30:39.874
in protecting
the rights of minorities.

1:30:39.907 --> 1:30:48.248
And gentlemen, we say
this is a minority,

1:30:50.318 --> 1:30:51.953
a silent minority,

1:30:54.522 --> 1:30:59.093
the true silent minority.

1:31:03.698 --> 1:31:06.033
Who is speaking
for these children?

1:31:09.036 --> 1:31:12.874
Who is counsel
for these children?

1:31:14.876 --> 1:31:17.345
These unborn children,

1:31:20.882 --> 1:31:23.851
whose lives are being taken.

1:31:28.189 --> 1:31:30.057
Where is the safeguard

1:31:32.193 --> 1:31:35.363
of a trial by jury?

1:31:40.701 --> 1:31:42.603
For Roe?

1:31:42.637 --> 1:31:45.339
<i>From the CBS
News headquarters in New York,</i>

1:31:45.373 --> 1:31:47.708
<i>this is the CBS Evening News</i>

1:31:47.742 --> 1:31:51.212

<i>"The Energy Crisis."</i>

1:32:27.915 --> 1:32:28.816
<i>Good evening.</i>

1:32:28.850 --> 1:32:30.151
<i>In a landmark ruling,</i>

1:32:30.184 --> 1:32:33.688
<i>the Supreme Court today
legalized abortions.</i>

1:32:33.721 --> 1:32:35.823
<i>The majority in cases
for Texas and Georgia</i>

1:32:35.857 --> 1:32:38.226
<i>said that the decision
to end a pregnancy</i>

1:32:38.259 --> 1:32:40.995
<i>during the first three months
belongs to the woman</i>

1:32:41.028 --> 1:32:42.964
<i>and her doctor,
not the government.</i>

1:32:52.106 --> 1:32:55.409
The Roe decision allows a woman
to have an abortion at any time,

1:32:55.443 --> 1:32:57.445
not just the first three months.

1:32:57.478 --> 1:32:58.946
Cronkite and the media
lied about that.

1:33:00.982 --> 1:33:03.784
But they said it doesn't have
the same rights as a person.

1:33:03.818 --> 1:33:06.187
Let me ask you,
if you found out today

1:33:06.220 --> 1:33:08.589
that you were pregnant
and I killed you,

1:33:08.623 --> 1:33:11.058
should I go to jail for
murdering one person or two?

1:33:12.426 --> 1:33:13.461
Uh...

1:33:15.096 --> 1:33:18.566
Most states would consider it
a double homicide,

1:33:18.599 --> 1:33:21.235
hence considering
the unborn a person.

1:33:22.803 --> 1:33:25.806
With that logic, why isn't
abortion considered homicide?

1:33:25.840 --> 1:33:27.875
The Supreme Court
allowed the Sierra Club

1:33:27.909 --> 1:33:29.311
to sue
the Walt Disney Mineral Park

1:33:29.344 --> 1:33:31.579
on behalf of inanimate objects.

1:33:31.612 --> 1:33:33.748
Justice Douglas argued

1:33:33.781 --> 1:33:36.250
that trees should be
granted personhood,

1:33:36.284 --> 1:33:39.487
that rivers, lakes,
and even pupfish have rights.

1:33:43.591 --> 1:33:45.327
Somebody read me
the constitutional amendment

1:33:45.360 --> 1:33:48.330
that states that we have the
right to kill an unborn child.

1:33:48.363 --> 1:33:49.463
Sir,

1:33:49.497 --> 1:33:51.866
it was just voted seven to two.

1:33:53.434 --> 1:33:54.969
The justices replaced
the framers' choices

1:33:55.002 --> 1:33:56.971
for personal predilections.

1:33:58.539 --> 1:34:00.508
But we have
a right to privacy.

1:34:01.976 --> 1:34:03.144
Where in the Constitution
does it state

1:34:03.177 --> 1:34:04.145
that we have that right?

1:34:08.716 --> 1:34:11.118
It doesn't,
and even if we did,

1:34:11.152 --> 1:34:13.154
privacy is not
an absolute right,

1:34:13.187 --> 1:34:16.190
so it can always be governed
by other rights.

1:34:16.223 --> 1:34:19.794
But the right to choose
is more important than a fetus.

1:34:19.827 --> 1:34:21.595
Why would you say that?

1:34:21.629 --> 1:34:23.864
A fetus is not a person,
and I am.

1:34:26.901 --> 1:34:28.469
So, what does a fetus become?

1:34:32.573 --> 1:34:34.842
A fetus has the DNA of a person.

1:34:34.875 --> 1:34:36.510
It's created by people.

1:34:36.544 --> 1:34:40.982
Left to nature,
that fetus becomes a person.

1:34:42.583 --> 1:34:44.386
<i>Dr. Taylor,
call the operator, please.</i>

1:34:44.419 --> 1:34:46.355
<i>Dr. Taylor,
call the operator.</i>

1:34:47.922 --> 1:34:49.256
Dr. Nathanson?

1:34:50.825 --> 1:34:52.159
I'm sorry. Can I help you?

1:34:52.193 --> 1:34:54.161
A butchery.

1:34:54.195 --> 1:34:56.197
Excuse me?

1:34:56.230 --> 1:34:59.500
You know
that even a safe abortion

1:34:59.533 --> 1:35:02.203
can make a woman sterile.

1:35:02.236 --> 1:35:03.405
Mildred Jefferson, right?

1:35:03.438 --> 1:35:06.173
Dr. Mildred Jefferson.

1:35:06.207 --> 1:35:07.742
Are you lost?

1:35:07.775 --> 1:35:08.809
Yes.

1:35:08.843 --> 1:35:11.679
Yes. Actually, I am. Very.

1:35:13.180 --> 1:35:15.916
How do you do what you do,
and live in good conscience?

1:35:15.950 --> 1:35:17.051
I have given abortions

1:35:17.084 --> 1:35:18.420
to my friends,

1:35:18.453 --> 1:35:20.921
my colleagues,
even my teachers.

1:35:20.955 --> 1:35:22.923
I've never had
a shred of self-doubt.

1:35:22.957 --> 1:35:25.059
And I've never wavered.

1:35:25.092 --> 1:35:27.061
So, you feel nothing?

1:35:27.094 --> 1:35:31.032
Just a sense of accomplishment
and pride of expertise.

1:35:31.065 --> 1:35:32.401
You see.

1:35:34.135 --> 1:35:39.006
When my girlfriend got pregnant
and I couldn't afford to have

1:35:39.040 --> 1:35:43.077
a child,
I not only demanded

1:35:43.110 --> 1:35:47.416
that she terminate the pregnancy
but I also informed her,

1:35:47.449 --> 1:35:50.851
since I was the most skilled
practitioner of the art,

1:35:50.885 --> 1:35:53.754
I myself would do the abortion.

1:35:53.788 --> 1:35:55.256
And I did.

1:35:58.926 --> 1:36:00.661
Are you sure
you wanna do this?

1:36:08.302 --> 1:36:09.471
Doctor...

1:36:09.504 --> 1:36:11.972
If you don't wanna be here,
you can leave.

1:36:34.628 --> 1:36:36.331
On your own child?

1:36:48.676 --> 1:36:50.345
I mean, why do you give life

1:36:50.378 --> 1:36:53.080
to those with no future?

1:36:53.114 --> 1:36:56.617
Aren't you tired
of creating new souls

1:36:56.650 --> 1:36:59.454
that end up with no purpose?

1:36:59.488 --> 1:37:02.491
I mean,
you must be bored, right?

1:37:02.524 --> 1:37:03.492
Or are you just like

1:37:03.525 --> 1:37:04.692
playing games?

1:37:05.860 --> 1:37:07.661
I've killed babies

1:37:07.695 --> 1:37:09.997
for the greater good.

1:37:10.030 --> 1:37:13.368
I've killed babies
in the name of saving women.

1:37:15.202 --> 1:37:18.706
And I've killed babies
because they were unwanted.

1:37:19.974 --> 1:37:21.309
You're a liar!

1:37:21.343 --> 1:37:24.011
You did this,
you led me down this path.

1:37:24.044 --> 1:37:25.347
You didn't want them.

1:37:26.515 --> 1:37:27.748
That's the truth.

1:37:30.485 --> 1:37:31.886
Because you wanna know why?

1:37:31.919 --> 1:37:34.922
I'm not the one who's supposed
to be perfect, you are.

1:37:37.024 --> 1:37:42.296
But I have done my best.
I have worked my hardest.

1:37:42.330 --> 1:37:44.765
I have served humanity.
You've watched me.

1:37:45.866 --> 1:37:46.867
Hm?

1:37:50.938 --> 1:37:53.040
Maybe you're just willing
but not able.

1:37:55.377 --> 1:37:57.445
And so you're just
not omnipotent.

1:37:59.180 --> 1:38:02.584
Or, are you able
and not willing and malevolent?

1:38:05.453 --> 1:38:07.888
I don't think it's either.

1:38:07.922 --> 1:38:13.961
The truth is, you are
neither willing nor able.

1:38:15.262 --> 1:38:17.097
So, why do I need to
call you God?

1:38:28.943 --> 1:38:31.413
Have you seen these
new high-tech ultrasounds?

1:38:31.446 --> 1:38:32.913
<i>In the '70s before Roe,</i>

1:38:32.947 --> 1:38:35.249
<i>no one had this technology.</i>

1:38:35.282 --> 1:38:38.085
<i>Not I, not the courts.</i>

1:38:38.118 --> 1:38:41.956
<i>This would change everything,
especially for me.</i>

1:38:41.989 --> 1:38:44.426
No, but I hear
the new imaging is great.

1:38:44.459 --> 1:38:46.293
You know what,
it helps a lot with accuracy.

1:38:46.328 --> 1:38:47.629
Let's go try it out.

1:39:26.334 --> 1:39:27.602
Are you okay?

1:39:38.112 --> 1:39:39.813
It is a person.

1:39:42.651 --> 1:39:44.619
It's a person.

1:39:50.124 --> 1:39:53.461
God, forgive me.
What have I done?

1:39:54.995 --> 1:39:57.831
I-I'm so sorry, God.

1:39:57.865 --> 1:39:59.833
I'm so sorry.

1:39:59.867 --> 1:40:02.704
Please, I want her back.

1:40:05.407 --> 1:40:07.709
I killed my own daughter.

1:40:23.824 --> 1:40:26.461
Doctor.
Phil McCombs, <i>Washington Post.</i>

1:40:26.494 --> 1:40:27.462
Thank you. Good to see you.

1:40:27.495 --> 1:40:28.663
Thank you
for taking the time.

1:40:38.440 --> 1:40:42.209
So, when you take them out,
you don't see anything?

1:40:44.746 --> 1:40:46.080
<i>No, you don't see anything.</i>

1:40:47.881 --> 1:40:49.317
<i>I-I-I mean,</i>

1:40:49.351 --> 1:40:51.852
<i>of all the thousands
of second trimester abortions</i>

1:40:51.885 --> 1:40:54.188
<i>that I've done, I mean,
maybe I've seen</i>

1:40:54.221 --> 1:40:56.190
half a dozen.

1:40:56.223 --> 1:40:58.526
But didn't it bother you
when you did?

1:40:58.560 --> 1:41:00.861
No, not particularly.
It was the end product,

1:41:00.894 --> 1:41:03.063
a lifeless limp thing
lying there.

1:41:03.097 --> 1:41:05.899
They have a human form.

1:41:05.933 --> 1:41:07.369
Oh, absolutely.

1:41:11.740 --> 1:41:14.642
I-I-I'm sorry.
I'm a little bit confused.

1:41:18.278 --> 1:41:22.116
First you said,
"All you see is bloody meat."

1:41:22.149 --> 1:41:24.284
Hm-mm.

1:41:24.319 --> 1:41:28.523
But now you're saying
you always knew it was a person.

1:41:28.556 --> 1:41:29.457
So Doctor,

1:41:31.959 --> 1:41:33.093
which one is it?

1:41:58.919 --> 1:41:59.953
I knew all along.

1:42:02.757 --> 1:42:04.291
Life exists at conception.

1:42:06.594 --> 1:42:09.831
I mean, I'd taken part
in over 70,000 abortions.

1:42:09.864 --> 1:42:12.901
I'd seen other sonograms.

1:42:12.933 --> 1:42:16.270
I knew in my heart
what I was doing was wrong.

1:42:16.303 --> 1:42:17.472
And I lied.

1:42:20.642 --> 1:42:22.744
I lied to the world.
I lied to God.

1:42:22.777 --> 1:42:25.212
More importantly.
I lied to me.

1:42:27.348 --> 1:42:28.850
But I kept on killing.

1:42:30.485 --> 1:42:32.654
Until I had the courage
to face the reality

1:42:32.687 --> 1:42:34.656
of the absolute horror
of what I was doing.

1:42:39.894 --> 1:42:41.629
<i>I had been an atheist,</i>

1:42:41.663 --> 1:42:45.165
<i>so my opinions on abortion
were not influenced by religion.</i>

1:42:45.199 --> 1:42:48.736

I could stand, I chose to kneel.</i>

The mass of Negroes,
particularly in the South,

1:44:20.895 --> 1:44:25.466
still breed carelessly
and disastrously.

1:44:27.635 --> 1:44:31.406
The result that the increase
among Negroes,

1:44:31.439 --> 1:44:33.808
more than among whites,

1:44:33.841 --> 1:44:36.611
is that portion
of the population

1:44:36.644 --> 1:44:40.014
least intelligent and fit.

1:44:41.516 --> 1:44:42.717
In our country,
there's been one group

1:44:42.750 --> 1:44:45.386
associated with
reactionary politics,

1:44:45.420 --> 1:44:48.890
behind-the-scenes manipulations,
and backward ideas.

1:44:48.923 --> 1:44:50.290
Wait, not the Catholics again?

1:44:50.325 --> 1:44:51.960
Of course, the Catholics.

1:44:51.993 --> 1:44:53.728
Catholic
and fundamentalist churches

1:44:53.761 --> 1:44:55.930
have constantly
violated the law.

1:44:55.964 --> 1:45:00.401
Violations which breach the wall
separating the church and state.

1:45:00.435 --> 1:45:02.403
<i>The justices cited Larry's book</i>

1:45:02.437 --> 1:45:06.507
<i>seven times in their decision,
citing no other legal historian.</i>

1:45:08.810 --> 1:45:12.313
<i>Jane Roe became known
to the world as Norma McCorvey.</i>

1:45:12.347 --> 1:45:14.415
<i>And when she learned the truth
that having an abortion</i>

1:45:14.449 --> 1:45:17.284
<i>was killing a baby
and not passing a period</i>

1:45:17.318 --> 1:45:22.457
<i>or removing a bunch of cells,
she became pro-life.</i>

1:45:22.490 --> 1:45:26.694
<i>See, the truth is, she herself
never even had an abortion.</i>

1:45:28.195 --> 1:45:29.998
<i>They lied to me.</i>

1:45:30.031 --> 1:45:33.334
<i>I didn't go to the Supreme Court
for a bunch of women.</i>

1:45:33.368 --> 1:45:36.169
Who lied to you?

1:45:36.203 --> 1:45:38.138
<i>Sarah Weddington.</i>

1:45:38.171 --> 1:45:40.475
<i>I asked her if she knew
where to get an abortion</i>

1:45:40.508 --> 1:45:43.111
<i>and she and Linda told me
that they didn't.</i>

1:45:43.143 --> 1:45:45.178
<i>She knew where.</i>

1:45:45.212 --> 1:45:47.815
Could you elaborate?

1:45:47.849 --> 1:45:50.351
<i>Sarah had an abortion
in Mexico.</i>

1:45:50.385 --> 1:45:53.721
<i>They were just looking
for somebody to use.</i>

1:45:53.755 --> 1:45:55.423
Do you feel
what you did was wrong?

1:46:00.528 --> 1:46:02.195
<i>You never had
an abortion, did you? I mean...</i>

1:46:02.229 --> 1:46:04.365
<i>No. No, sir.
I never had an abortion.</i>

1:46:04.399 --> 1:46:05.833
<i>You carried
your child to full term.</i>

1:46:05.867 --> 1:46:07.200
<i>Yes, sir, I did.</i>

1:46:07.234 --> 1:46:08.703
<i>You wanted an abortion.</i>

1:46:08.736 --> 1:46:10.338
<i>Yes, sir, I did.</i>

1:46:10.371 --> 1:46:12.305
<i>And in a sense,
you were angry at one point</i>

1:46:12.340 --> 1:46:14.909
<i>at Sarah Weddington
for not letting you get one</i>

1:46:14.942 --> 1:46:17.177
<i>because it didn't suit
their purposes at that time.</i>

1:46:17.210 --> 1:46:19.313
<i>They needed you
to be pregnant, right?</i>

1:46:19.347 --> 1:46:21.248
<i>They needed their plaintiff
to be pregnant,</i>

1:46:21.281 --> 1:46:22.850
<i>it is exactly right.</i>

1:46:22.884 --> 1:46:26.186
<i>But see, what really was
the tell-in of the whole schmeil</i>

1:46:26.219 --> 1:46:28.923
<i>was the fact that when
Sarah Weddington came out</i>

1:46:28.956 --> 1:46:32.493
<i>with her book, I don't know,
two or three years ago,</i>

1:46:32.527 --> 1:46:34.929
<i>she told in her book
that she had an abortion</i>

1:46:34.962 --> 1:46:37.230
<i>and she went to Mexico.</i>

1:46:37.264 --> 1:46:40.168
<i>And when I sat across that table
at Colombo's Pizza</i>

1:46:40.200 --> 1:46:43.004
<i>here in Dallas, Texas
and I asked her,</i>

1:46:43.037 --> 1:46:44.539
<i>I said, "Sarah, do you know</i>

1:46:44.572 --> 1:46:46.541
<i>where I can go
and get an abortion?"</i>

1:46:46.574 --> 1:46:50.778
<i>And she said, "No."
Well, she lied to me.</i>

1:46:50.812 --> 1:46:52.245
<i>Some justices</i>

1:46:52.279 --> 1:46:53.848
<i>were leaking to the press.</i>

1:46:53.881 --> 1:46:56.216
<i>Some had family members
working for Planned Parenthood.</i>

1:46:56.249 --> 1:46:58.186
<i>Burger and other justices
then changed their vote</i>

1:46:58.218 --> 1:47:01.322
<i>because of public outcry
and family pressure.</i>

1:47:04.058 --> 1:47:05.760
<i>Dr. Mildred Jefferson
became the president</i>

1:47:05.793 --> 1:47:07.528
<i>of National Right to Life,</i>

1:47:07.562 --> 1:47:09.464
<i>and an influence
on President Reagan</i>

1:47:09.497 --> 1:47:10.765
<i>becoming pro-life.</i>

1:47:12.467 --> 1:47:14.769
<i>I produced a documentary</i>
<i>called</i> The Silent Scream

1:47:14.802 --> 1:47:18.238
<i>where 18 days before
you even miss your period</i>

1:47:18.271 --> 1:47:22.376
<i>and realize you're pregnant,
there is a heartbeat.</i>

1:47:22.410 --> 1:47:25.747
<i>At ten weeks, when you go
to abort your baby,</i>

1:47:25.780 --> 1:47:28.983
<i>she will actually feel the pain
of having her limbs torn off.</i>

1:47:29.016 --> 1:47:32.086
This is the silent scream

1:47:32.120 --> 1:47:36.190
of a child threatened
imminently with extinction.
