WEBVTT

00:18.435 --> 00:20.729
-Oh my God!
-Really?

00:20.812 --> 00:22.480
I sent you a photo to prepare you

00:22.564 --> 00:24.482
specifically so I wouldn't
get that reaction.

00:24.566 --> 00:27.027
Sorry. It's a little angrier in person.

00:27.110 --> 00:28.445
Kind of like Ellen DeGeneres.

00:28.528 --> 00:32.323
But don't worry, you'll look like
a cover girl by the time I'm through. Sit.

00:32.407 --> 00:35.452
Oh! And, uh… this'll make you feel better.

00:35.535 --> 00:36.536
Hmm.

00:36.619 --> 00:38.580
We got our big-ass commission check

00:38.663 --> 00:40.123
-on Claire's apartment!

00:40.206 --> 00:41.875
-Oh, snap!

00:41.958 --> 00:43.960
Oh, look at all those lovely zeroes.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.837
-Mm.
-They really get that number on its feet.

00:45.920 --> 00:50.508
I'm gonna use this money as a down payment
to buy out Colin's half of the apartment.

00:50.592 --> 00:51.468
Seriously?

00:52.635 --> 00:53.928
When did you talk to him?

00:54.012 --> 00:55.346
I will today, at the wedding.

00:55.430 --> 00:58.558
It's supposed to be on the market
six months after we separated,

00:58.641 --> 01:01.811
but I really wanna stay here.

01:01.895 --> 01:05.607
In spite of everything that's happened,
I love this place. It's my home.

01:05.690 --> 01:08.735
Of course it is. Did you always have
this little scar above your eye?

01:08.818 --> 01:12.864
No, that's a permanent souvenir
of the gay ski weekend smackdown.

01:12.947 --> 01:14.824
Does it happen to look… sexy?

01:15.533 --> 01:18.912
-Sure.
-Ugh, I really should sue Billy.

01:20.163 --> 01:21.664
Because of him, I have to see Colin

01:21.748 --> 01:23.958
for the first time in months,
looking like this.

01:24.042 --> 01:26.753
He'll probably be with his new boyfriend,
the hot architect.

01:26.836 --> 01:28.797
How do you know?
Did you ask the Jonathans?

01:28.880 --> 01:31.549
No, but I was invited with a guest,
so I'm sure he was too.

01:31.633 --> 01:35.261
And by the look of those pics in Miami,
they seem pretty serious.

01:35.345 --> 01:36.805
-Sorry, baby.
-Thanks.

01:36.888 --> 01:38.848
I've been meditating on it.
I bought an app.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.642
So I think I'm in a pretty zen place.

01:40.725 --> 01:41.684
-Okay.
-Yeah.

01:41.768 --> 01:43.394
There's nothing I can do
about any of this.

01:43.478 --> 01:44.896
-That's right.
-I just have to…

01:44.979 --> 01:46.397
…let it all go.

01:46.481 --> 01:49.025
-That's right.
-Jesus! Can't you fix this?

01:49.109 --> 01:51.027
I look like the last one out of Chernobyl!

01:51.111 --> 01:54.114
Yeah, you seem super chill
about the whole thing.

01:54.197 --> 01:59.619
Well, look, so Kai's friend told me
that Kai found his father on 23andMe.

01:59.702 --> 02:03.832
Apparently, the guy lives in New York,
and Kai is planning to meet him.

02:03.915 --> 02:06.126
Wow, bury the headline.

02:06.209 --> 02:10.130
Not so much "bury" as "wait for Michael
to unravel, and then you can have a turn."

02:10.713 --> 02:12.340
Fair enough. How do you feel?

02:13.007 --> 02:14.801
Weird.

02:15.343 --> 02:18.847
You know, this is a guy that I had
a one-night stand with 26 years ago

02:18.930 --> 02:20.682
in Amsterdam, Berlin, or Rome.

02:20.765 --> 02:24.811
And… I mean,
it's been me and Kai all these years,

02:24.894 --> 02:28.064
and now he suddenly wants a dad?

02:28.148 --> 02:30.942
You have absolutely no memory
of any of these guys?

02:31.025 --> 02:32.402
Before you start slut-shaming,

02:32.485 --> 02:35.113
do you remember all the one-nighters
you had in your 20s?

02:35.697 --> 02:37.031
I withdraw the question.

02:37.115 --> 02:38.158
Oh.

02:38.241 --> 02:41.452
As much as I'm dying
to talk to him about everything,

02:42.620 --> 02:44.414
-I don't wanna push it.
-Yeah.

02:44.497 --> 02:46.916
You're doing the right thing.
Let him tell you in his own time.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.253
It's like coming out.You shouldn't
force someone before they're ready.

02:50.336 --> 02:54.007
Like Brittany Blumberg did
to a very confused 15-year-old boy

02:54.090 --> 02:57.302
just because he happened to know
all of the lyrics to "Express Yourself."

03:09.772 --> 03:10.899
Sure I look okay?

03:10.982 --> 03:14.777
Yes! Just avoid direct sunlight
and favor your good side.

03:14.861 --> 03:18.781
Hey, guys. You remember Wyatt
from Colin's birthday?

03:18.865 --> 03:22.535
That night was a blur for many reasons,
but yes, nice to see you again, Wyatt.

03:22.619 --> 03:25.455
You too. I'm sorry to hear about you and--

03:25.538 --> 03:28.374
It's all good now. Manageable, anyway.
Haven't seen him in a while.

03:28.458 --> 03:29.542
The last time was not great.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.961
I guess am a bit nervous.
Do I look like I have makeup on?

03:32.045 --> 03:34.672
Oh my God. Here, drink this,
and calm the fuck down.

03:34.756 --> 03:38.301
-Billy's wearin' more makeup than you.
-I came right from the studio.

03:38.384 --> 03:40.011
Yeah, but you touched it up in the car.

03:40.553 --> 03:42.263
I think we may need to have a talk

03:42.347 --> 03:45.308
about what grown-ups do
in private, young man.

03:45.391 --> 03:48.394
You keep it up, Wyatt.
Billy's chops could use a little bustin'.

03:48.895 --> 03:51.147
I gotta go to the ladies'.
Any idea where it is?

03:51.231 --> 03:52.649
It's upstairs. I'll walk you.

03:52.732 --> 03:56.819
Funny, and a gentleman
with skin like a baby's ass.

03:56.903 --> 03:58.363
Whatever do you see in him, Billy?

04:00.865 --> 04:04.953
Wow, this may actually be
a first second date.

04:05.036 --> 04:07.622
Yeah, it's been a while
since I've had one of those.

04:07.705 --> 04:09.040
But I've been thinking about him,

04:09.123 --> 04:11.251
and he called,
so I asked if he wanted to come.

04:11.334 --> 04:13.336
I really like the kid, Mikey.

04:13.419 --> 04:15.421
I think I might give it
the old college try.

04:15.505 --> 04:17.131
That's so great, Billy.

04:17.215 --> 04:20.301
Even if what you're trying for
is literally still in college.

04:20.385 --> 04:21.261
Ha ha.

04:24.055 --> 04:26.724
I haven't seen him.
I don't think he's here yet.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.893
Well, then here's to the calm
before the storm.

04:30.812 --> 04:31.688
Mm…

04:32.939 --> 04:34.691
-There's Stanley.
-Oh.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.985
What's going on with him? He looks so sad.

04:37.068 --> 04:38.486
That's his gay wedding face.

04:38.569 --> 04:41.239
It's like every time
he hears another "I do,"

04:41.322 --> 04:43.658
-it just reminds him that he don't.

04:49.205 --> 04:51.457
Hey, honey, how are you?

04:52.041 --> 04:53.209
I'm…

04:53.293 --> 04:54.460
I…

04:54.544 --> 04:56.087
Oh, come on, now.

04:56.170 --> 04:58.673
Don't be down about the wedding.
The Jonathans found each other.

04:58.756 --> 05:02.176
There's hope for everyone.
You still have plenty of time.

05:02.260 --> 05:04.804
Thank you for the patronizing sentiment,

05:04.887 --> 05:06.514
but I'm not worried about the wedding.

05:07.015 --> 05:10.351
As for having plenty of time,
I'm not so sure about that either. I…

05:10.435 --> 05:12.520
I got a call from my doctor this morning.

05:12.603 --> 05:14.814
-On a Saturday?
-He got some test results.

05:14.897 --> 05:15.732
It's…

05:17.942 --> 05:18.943
not good.

05:19.027 --> 05:22.071
Uh… You're scaring me, Stanley.
What is it?

05:22.822 --> 05:23.656
I have…

05:27.869 --> 05:28.745
breast cancer.

05:29.495 --> 05:31.789
-What?
-He's joking.

05:31.873 --> 05:33.041
I wish I were.

05:34.584 --> 05:35.543
Oh my God.

05:36.878 --> 05:38.713
-I can't believe it.
-Me either.

05:39.380 --> 05:42.967
But it's true.
I have stage-one breast cancer.

05:43.051 --> 05:44.302
But you're a dude.

05:45.553 --> 05:47.263
Wait, have you always been a dude?

05:49.557 --> 05:50.433
Sorry.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.060
Apparently, they caught it early,

05:52.143 --> 05:56.189
but I have to see my doctor on Monday
to discuss treatment.

05:56.272 --> 05:58.816
Will you go with me?
I need another pair of ears.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.818
I'm so wobbly,
I'll probably miss half of it.

06:00.902 --> 06:04.489
Of course. Don't worry. It'll be okay.

06:05.239 --> 06:08.409
That's what people say
when they have no idea if it will be okay.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.287
Don't look now.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.081
There's Colin.

06:13.164 --> 06:14.791
-You know…

06:14.874 --> 06:16.959
Oh, and the hot architect.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.379
You should go over, say hi.
Get it out of the way.

06:19.462 --> 06:21.464
He's right. Don't worry. It'll be okay.

06:22.340 --> 06:23.424
Oops.

06:23.508 --> 06:24.926
All right, I'll be back.

06:28.304 --> 06:30.056
How do you think you got the titty cancer?

06:36.187 --> 06:39.565
Hi, Colin. Hello, I'm Michael, the ex.

06:39.649 --> 06:44.529
I know it looks like I was in a bar fight,
but no, I got drunk at gay ski weekend,

06:44.612 --> 06:46.906
and the friends
who were taking me to my room

06:46.989 --> 06:48.199
dropped me on my face.

06:48.282 --> 06:49.158
Nice to meet you.

06:50.034 --> 06:53.413
Hello. I'm Craig,
and this is my wife, Janet.

06:54.288 --> 06:56.374
-Sorry, wife?
-The train was moving too fast.

06:56.457 --> 06:57.375
I couldn't stop you.

06:57.458 --> 06:58.626
Oh, my…

06:59.127 --> 07:02.296
I thought he was your new boyfriend,
the architect.

07:02.880 --> 07:05.550
I saw pictures of you guys
in Miami last week.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.552
First of all, that guy's not my boyfriend.

07:07.635 --> 07:11.097
He's somebody I went out with a few times
who happened to be in Miami.

07:11.180 --> 07:13.224
Second, he looks nothing like Craig.

07:13.307 --> 07:14.684
Craig, Janet, Colin.

07:15.184 --> 07:17.770
Third, I'd never have brought a date
to this out of respect…

07:17.854 --> 07:18.813
Did you bring somebody?

07:18.896 --> 07:22.358
No. Honestly, I was just trying
to make you feel comfortable

07:22.442 --> 07:24.110
and not have it be weird between us again.

07:24.694 --> 07:27.572
I am sorry about the dog meltdown.

07:27.655 --> 07:31.242
My mother heard the whole tirade
and called me a whiny bitch,

07:31.325 --> 07:34.537
in case you were wondering
whose side she came down on.

07:34.620 --> 07:37.748
That's okay. I probably should've
broken that news more thoughtfully.

07:39.083 --> 07:41.377
He pooped in my Prada loafers,
if it makes you feel better.

07:41.461 --> 07:45.173
Yeah, I don't love that it makes me
feel better, but it does.

07:47.008 --> 07:50.470
If everyone could get to their seats,
the ceremony is about to begin.

07:52.346 --> 07:54.474
-I guess I'll see you later.
-Sounds good.

08:17.497 --> 08:20.666
Friends, family,
and loved ones,

08:20.750 --> 08:24.378
we gather today to celebrate
the marriage of Jonathan and Jonathan.

08:24.462 --> 08:27.798
Two halves joining
to create one long, happy life together.

08:27.882 --> 08:28.716
I'm okay.

08:28.799 --> 08:32.845
Jonathan, in sickness and in health,
till death do you part?

08:33.387 --> 08:35.223
-I do.
-And Jonathan?

08:36.557 --> 08:37.767
I do.

08:39.310 --> 08:40.645
And now the rings.

08:42.146 --> 08:44.482
They symbolize your commitment
to each other

08:44.565 --> 08:46.901
and a daily reminder
that you are a family.

08:46.984 --> 08:47.944
My best friend.

08:48.027 --> 08:49.654
-My heart.
-Forever.

08:49.737 --> 08:51.030
-Yeah!
-Hup!

08:51.113 --> 08:53.824
-Mazel tov!

08:53.908 --> 08:57.411
I now pronounce you husband and husband.

08:58.037 --> 08:59.664
You may kiss your Jonathan.

09:11.050 --> 09:13.469
Only one percent of men get breast cancer.

09:13.970 --> 09:16.180
That is not the one percent
I aspired to be in.

09:16.264 --> 09:19.559
Well, I had a scare three years ago,
and I had just had 'em lifted.

09:20.059 --> 09:24.146
Eight grand to perk these babies up,
and now you find some funny cells?

09:24.230 --> 09:29.485
But they radiated the fuck outta
that bitch, and I'm totally fine now.

09:29.569 --> 09:30.653
You will be too, sweetie.

09:30.736 --> 09:35.283
Stage-one tumors are very responsive
to treatment. Survival rate is nearly 90%.

09:35.908 --> 09:38.160
First-year med student at Columbia.

09:38.244 --> 09:41.205
He's going to be a doctor too?
Oh, so it's official.

09:41.289 --> 09:42.582
There is no God.

09:43.833 --> 09:46.168
All you got goin' on,
what are you doin' with this geezer?

09:46.252 --> 09:47.878
-I know, right?
-Yeah.

09:48.921 --> 09:52.383
But I'm kind of crazy about him.
I guess you could say I'm an old soul.

09:52.466 --> 09:54.677
Oof, don't tell Billy that.
You're already at the cutoff.

09:55.928 --> 09:58.222
Hey, did you talk to Colin
about the apartment?

09:58.306 --> 10:00.808
I was going to,
and then the ceremony started.

10:01.475 --> 10:03.686
Maybe I'll go over now.
His table looks pretty empty.

10:04.353 --> 10:06.731
It's okay to say hello to him, by the way.

10:06.814 --> 10:07.940
He's done his time.

10:08.024 --> 10:10.276
-I'm commuting his sentence.
-Seriously?

10:10.359 --> 10:13.529
Yeah. It's just too exhausting
to stay mad anymore.

10:14.405 --> 10:16.365
Come here. I'm so proud of you.

10:16.449 --> 10:17.533
-Mwah!

10:22.580 --> 10:25.374
Was it something you said?
Where is everybody?

10:26.334 --> 10:27.543
You got the friends table.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.211
I got the gay singles table.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.213
I think they're in the bathroom
doing blow.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.507
Note all the untouched plates of food.

10:33.591 --> 10:35.718
At least you'll get to take home
the centerpiece.

10:35.801 --> 10:39.639
No, not necessarily. There's a twitchy
shoe salesman who's got his eye on it.

10:39.722 --> 10:42.558
Although that might be
just a fetching little tic.

10:42.642 --> 10:43.726
Oh, sounds promising!

10:43.809 --> 10:45.227
-Um…

10:45.311 --> 10:48.230
Anyway, there's this little business thing
that I would like to--

10:48.314 --> 10:53.027
Everyone, the mother of Puerto Rican
Jonathan wants to make a toast!

10:53.527 --> 10:56.864
First, let me say I'm thrilled

10:56.947 --> 11:00.660
that after 12 years, one child,

11:00.743 --> 11:04.872
and six trips to Mykonos
that could have been honeymoons…

11:06.165 --> 11:09.293
…these boys are finally making it legal!

11:12.922 --> 11:14.256
Though, as a devout Catholic,

11:14.340 --> 11:17.093
I'm not sure that them living in sin
was my biggest problem.

11:18.094 --> 11:18.928
-Gay joke.
-Yeah.

11:19.011 --> 11:21.389
But I really wanna thank

11:22.056 --> 11:25.851
their very good friends,
Michael and Colin,

11:25.935 --> 11:27.687
who I see right there,

11:27.770 --> 11:29.230
for splitting up,

11:29.730 --> 11:33.776
because it scared my son
into marrying Jewish Jonathan

11:33.859 --> 11:36.404
after seeing how easily
a relationship can end

11:36.487 --> 11:39.156
without the threat of divorce
hanging over it!

11:39.824 --> 11:41.784
-Glad we could help!
-Hear, hear.

11:41.867 --> 11:42.993
Cheers, everyone!

11:43.494 --> 11:45.454
-Cheers.

11:46.622 --> 11:48.749
Wh--

11:48.833 --> 11:52.586
A little unexpected attention.
Thanks, Tipsy Teresa.

11:52.670 --> 11:55.005
At least something good
came out of our breakup.

11:56.424 --> 11:59.468
You know, I always thought
if we ever did this, got married,

11:59.552 --> 12:01.053
it would be just the two of us.

12:01.554 --> 12:06.392
No walk down the aisle, no party.
Just… private.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.186
I guess I'm glad we didn't.

12:10.187 --> 12:12.022
If we were to end up where we are,

12:13.399 --> 12:17.194
getting married wouldn't have
prevented you from becoming unhappy.

12:18.154 --> 12:21.699
I don't know that I was unhappy… exactly.
It's just…

12:22.783 --> 12:25.119
So much of our lives
had been together, and…

12:25.828 --> 12:27.955
I don't-- Everything going forward
seemed so inevitable.

12:29.415 --> 12:32.793
I couldn't accept the fact that the rest
of my story had already been written.

12:35.963 --> 12:37.798
Funny, I found that comforting.

12:40.092 --> 12:43.721
Well, thanks to your midlife crisis,
now I get to have one of my own.

12:43.804 --> 12:47.349
-Michael, I didn't mean--
-No, no, no, it's all good. It's all good.

12:48.976 --> 12:50.269
I want you to be happy.

12:50.770 --> 12:51.645
I really do.

12:53.397 --> 12:55.399
Now we both have new stories to write.

12:56.984 --> 12:57.818
Thanks.

12:59.236 --> 13:01.405
-I want you to be happy too.
-Thanks.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.407
What's this business you wanna talk about?

13:04.700 --> 13:08.704
Yeah, so I appreciate that you have been
paying for half the mortgage,

13:08.788 --> 13:10.456
and I know you wanna put it on the market,

13:11.081 --> 13:13.042
but I just got a big commission check,

13:13.125 --> 13:16.754
and I'd like to buy you out
and stay in the apartment.

13:16.837 --> 13:18.422
Oh! Wow. Um…

13:20.549 --> 13:23.636
I mean, I totally get you wanting
to stay in the apartment. It's just, um…

13:24.970 --> 13:27.890
my investment brain needs to figure out
if it's the right move.

13:29.099 --> 13:32.478
-Can I think about it for a little while?
-Yeah, sure.

13:32.561 --> 13:36.106
-Look who's back and ready to party.
-Oh.

13:36.857 --> 13:37.983
I'll leave you two.

13:43.030 --> 13:43.948
Miss me?

13:45.199 --> 13:46.867
Oh!

13:47.660 --> 13:49.703
How about that crazy toast?

13:49.787 --> 13:51.539
I was a second away from pretending

13:51.622 --> 13:53.499
to choke on a chicken bone
as a distraction,

13:53.582 --> 13:57.044
but that would mean putting this chicken
in my mouth, and have you tasted it?

13:57.127 --> 13:59.088
They did not break the bank
on the catering.

13:59.171 --> 14:00.923
-No, that's fine.

14:01.006 --> 14:03.342
We actually had
a nice, drama-free conversation.

14:03.425 --> 14:06.345
But he wants to "think"
about me buying him out.

14:06.428 --> 14:08.222
Why? What is there to think about?

14:08.305 --> 14:10.891
"Investment, the right move,
blah, blah, blah."

14:10.975 --> 14:14.562
-Hey there, wedding guests!
-Oh! Hi!

14:14.645 --> 14:16.063
-Having fun?
-Oh, so much!

14:16.146 --> 14:19.233
I'm so glad you could all be here
to celebrate our special day,

14:19.316 --> 14:21.235
-our nearest and dearest friends.

14:21.318 --> 14:23.654
And Billy's plus-one. Hello there.

14:23.737 --> 14:26.949
Uh-- Hi. Wyatt. We met at Colin's 50th.

14:27.032 --> 14:28.325
Congratulations.

14:28.409 --> 14:30.578
Thanks. Colin and Michael
are the whole reason--

14:30.661 --> 14:33.789
Oh my gosh. Seriously?
Your mother just told the entire room.

14:34.790 --> 14:37.334
FYI, it's maybe not the romantic story
you think it is.

14:38.085 --> 14:39.044
How did you two meet?

14:39.128 --> 14:40.838
We were hitting on the same guy
at a party,

14:40.921 --> 14:42.631
who didn't
give either of us the time of day.

14:42.715 --> 14:46.510
So then we started talking, and by the end
of the night, we fell in love.

14:46.594 --> 14:47.720
Save room for cake.

14:47.803 --> 14:48.929
Aw.

14:49.013 --> 14:50.306
They seem so happy.

14:50.389 --> 14:52.433
Yeah, it's a real fairy tale.

14:52.516 --> 14:53.475
Two rejects hook up

14:53.559 --> 14:56.562
and 12 years later get married
to legally trap each other forever.

14:57.146 --> 14:58.647
You're so mean!

14:59.648 --> 15:02.860
I know underneath that hard shell,
there's a soft, squishy center.

15:02.943 --> 15:06.405
Which is exactly the opposite
of how the lump in my breast feels.

15:08.073 --> 15:09.283
Bon appétit!

15:10.743 --> 15:11.577
Thank you.

15:13.370 --> 15:15.998
Suzanne, you look so beautiful.

15:16.081 --> 15:17.374
Ow!

15:17.458 --> 15:19.501
Sorry. I needed to get that out the way.

15:20.169 --> 15:23.047
Thank you. Now come over here
and give me a hug.

15:23.672 --> 15:25.299
-Come on!
-Oh!

15:26.133 --> 15:27.927
Oh, I missed you so much.

15:28.010 --> 15:31.639
I missed you too. I didn't know how to…
Or if you'd even want to…

15:31.722 --> 15:33.223
-I know. I know.
-Yeah.

15:33.807 --> 15:37.561
But the ban has been lifted,
so we're cool.

15:38.312 --> 15:39.188
How are you?

15:39.688 --> 15:40.856
Good. Yeah.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.275
-Adjusting.
-Mm.

15:44.318 --> 15:47.988
Tonight's a little strange. Kind of feel
like I have one foot back in my old life.

15:48.072 --> 15:50.616
But it's nice to see everybody. How's Kai?

15:51.784 --> 15:55.663
Kai just found his father on 23andMe,
and he's planning on meeting him,

15:55.746 --> 15:57.289
and he doesn't know that I know.

15:57.373 --> 15:58.666
-Oh, wow.
-Mm-hmm.

15:58.749 --> 16:03.087
-You gonna tell him?
-I want to, but that's making it about me.

16:03.170 --> 16:07.383
Sometimes, we have to make
a selfless decision

16:07.466 --> 16:09.802
that's better for the person we love,

16:10.594 --> 16:13.263
or loved, than for ourselves.

16:14.306 --> 16:19.728
-You mean Michael and the apartment.
-Oh! Look at you! Catchin' on so quick!

16:19.812 --> 16:23.440
Look, the apartment has appreciated
approximately 40% since we bought it,

16:23.524 --> 16:26.819
so the logical thing to do
would be to sell it, split the proceeds.

16:26.902 --> 16:28.904
We'd both be assured of fair market value.

16:28.988 --> 16:32.157
There you go with that sparkling
finance repartee. Look, Colin.

16:33.033 --> 16:35.828
I love you,
but you did a shitty thing to Michael.

16:36.912 --> 16:38.414
You have a chance to do a nice thing.

16:39.665 --> 16:43.961
Honestly, I pictured different people,
strangers, living there after we left.

16:44.044 --> 16:46.588
Now Michael's probably gonna meet somebody
new, they'll live there…

16:46.672 --> 16:48.257
It just feels a little weird.

16:48.340 --> 16:49.675
Well, baby…

16:52.177 --> 16:53.220
you did that.

17:06.900 --> 17:07.943
Oh, hi, Billy.

17:09.319 --> 17:10.446
Danny Weaver.

17:11.113 --> 17:12.239
Sorry. Have we--

17:12.322 --> 17:15.534
Last summer on Fire Island? At Tea Dance?

17:16.702 --> 17:18.370
We hooked up at your house.

17:18.454 --> 17:21.415
Right. Yeah. Hi, Danny.

17:22.958 --> 17:23.792
That was fun.

17:24.585 --> 17:25.627
It was.

17:26.712 --> 17:30.007
If you're down for hangin' out,
I could give you my number.

17:30.090 --> 17:31.050
Oh, I'm down.

17:37.681 --> 17:39.141
See you soon. I hope.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.022
Unbelievable.

17:46.231 --> 17:48.859
You literally took that guy's number
to hook up right in front of me?

17:48.942 --> 17:50.360
I… Uh…

17:50.444 --> 17:53.655
I mean, in my defense, I…
I didn't know you were there.

17:55.157 --> 17:57.201
That is so fucking disrespectful,

17:57.284 --> 17:59.495
hitting on a waiter
while you're here with me.

18:00.579 --> 18:04.291
That's something someone my age would do.
You're almost 50 years old. Grow up.

18:04.374 --> 18:06.085
Okay, Wyatt, calm down.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.670
No, I was actually
starting to care about you.

18:09.630 --> 18:11.590
Even though everyone warned me
you were a player,

18:11.673 --> 18:14.134
just some old guy
who still thinks he's hot shit.

18:14.218 --> 18:16.053
I told them, "No, he's more than that."

18:16.678 --> 18:18.430
But now I see they were right.

18:18.514 --> 18:20.057
Babe, come on.

18:20.140 --> 18:23.894
You don't care about anyone but yourself.

18:23.977 --> 18:28.357
You're just a shallow,
narcissistic gay cliché.

18:30.150 --> 18:30.984
Yuck.

18:31.610 --> 18:32.945
Wyatt, please.

18:44.289 --> 18:47.167
-Oh. Oh God.

18:56.426 --> 18:57.636
Hey, Kai, what's up?

18:57.719 --> 18:59.471
So Trey told me you know

19:00.764 --> 19:01.849
about my<i>…</i>

19:02.850 --> 19:04.059
dad person.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.145
-Uh…

19:06.687 --> 19:07.563
Yeah.

19:08.438 --> 19:09.273
I, um…

19:09.815 --> 19:12.818
And I-- I completely support
whatever you choose to do.

19:12.901 --> 19:15.279
I'm supposed to meet him
at L'Express at 8:30.

19:16.321 --> 19:18.282
<i>I've been going back and forth</i>
<i>about it for days.</i>

19:18.365 --> 19:21.118
That's why I didn't tell you.
I wanted it to be my decision.

19:21.201 --> 19:25.581
Yeah, no, I-- I understand. Wait, 8:30.
That's soon. You'd better get goin'.

19:25.664 --> 19:28.083
-I just texted him I'm not coming.
-What?

19:29.835 --> 19:30.669
Why not?

19:30.752 --> 19:33.255
You're my family. I've got all I need.

19:36.717 --> 19:38.093
So you're not even curious?

19:38.177 --> 19:40.721
No, I actually think
it'll just fuck me up more.

19:40.804 --> 19:42.931
<i>I don't need another complication</i>
<i>in my life.</i>

19:43.015 --> 19:46.268
Besides, you take up enough oxygen
for two parents.

19:46.351 --> 19:48.687
You probably get your sarcasm from him.

19:51.899 --> 19:54.359
<i>How did he respond</i>
<i>when you said you weren't coming?</i>

19:54.860 --> 19:57.613
Said he'd stay there for two hours
in case I changed my mind.

19:58.697 --> 19:59.573
But I won't.

20:02.075 --> 20:03.994
Bring me home a slice of gay wedding cake.

20:04.077 --> 20:07.497
I'm about to smoke a bowl,
so, you know… munchies.

20:07.581 --> 20:09.041
You got it, baby.

20:24.973 --> 20:26.934
Why didn't you ask me
to take you to the doctor?

20:28.143 --> 20:28.977
What?

20:29.061 --> 20:31.104
Why did you ask Michael and not me?

20:33.857 --> 20:37.569
I'm going to be a mess in that office,
and I'm not gonna hear everything.

20:37.653 --> 20:41.073
And unless the doctor is 25 and shirtless,
you won't hear anything either

20:41.156 --> 20:42.908
because you'll be scrolling on Grindr.

20:42.991 --> 20:44.868
-That's not true.
-I'm sorry.

20:44.952 --> 20:46.078
That was rude.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.789
I hear you graduated to Tinder.

20:50.874 --> 20:52.626
Is that really what you think of me?

20:53.752 --> 20:57.923
That I'm a-- a what?
A… a shallow narcissist?

20:59.091 --> 21:00.217
I didn't say that.

21:01.385 --> 21:02.302
Exactly.

21:03.512 --> 21:04.429
Honey…

21:05.180 --> 21:07.307
You know I love you,

21:07.391 --> 21:09.268
but you are who you are.

21:09.351 --> 21:13.563
One of your great qualities
is that at least you're honest about it.

21:16.566 --> 21:19.736
-I wanna go to the doctor with you.
-Billy, where is this coming from?

21:19.820 --> 21:20.654
And where's Wyatt?

21:24.324 --> 21:25.534
I love you, Stanley.

21:27.202 --> 21:29.496
Whatever happens, I am here for you.

21:34.251 --> 21:36.962
Why do I suddenly feel
like I'm comforting you?

21:45.721 --> 21:47.889
Get it! Get it! Get it! What!

21:47.973 --> 21:49.933
-Uh-oh! Uh-oh! Uh-oh!

21:50.017 --> 21:53.562
Oh, look who it is!
You realize this is a dance floor, right?

21:53.645 --> 21:55.314
Yeah, mind if I join?

21:55.397 --> 21:59.318
Oh! Make room, everybody! Wall Street
wants to bust a move. Go ahead, baby!

21:59.401 --> 22:02.988
-Look at this sight! I am impressed.
-What?

22:03.071 --> 22:05.449
Normally you're like
a sideline Sam at these things.

22:05.532 --> 22:07.868
All of a sudden,
you're <i>So You Think You Can Dance?</i>

22:07.951 --> 22:11.288
What happened? Oh, right, you lost 165 lb.

22:11.371 --> 22:12.914
-Ah!
-Wow!

22:13.707 --> 22:16.460
No, I just wanted to be out here
with you guys.

22:16.543 --> 22:17.878
Aw, that's sweet.

22:17.961 --> 22:21.506
Make sure you save a dance
for my cousin Phillip. He's so into you.

22:23.008 --> 22:23.842
Whoo!

22:26.845 --> 22:28.221
That's our song, baby!

22:29.348 --> 22:30.599
Happy wedding!

22:45.197 --> 22:48.450
What are you dancing with me for?
Cousin Phillip is drooling over you.

22:48.533 --> 22:51.036
-He did give me his number.

22:51.119 --> 22:54.289
I can get ten percent off any item
at It's Shoetime in Newark,

22:54.373 --> 22:55.791
so not a total waste.

22:57.793 --> 23:00.170
-Oh boy.

23:00.253 --> 23:03.173
We seem to be exciting comments
among the crowd.

23:03.256 --> 23:04.216
Oh, yes.

23:04.841 --> 23:07.427
We're everyone's favorite distraction
from their boring lives

23:07.511 --> 23:09.596
-for the next five minutes.

23:09.679 --> 23:11.431
Enjoy your moment in the spotlight.

23:13.642 --> 23:16.478
-Are you wearing makeup?
-No!St… N…

23:16.561 --> 23:18.897
-What?
-Okay, fine.

23:18.980 --> 23:23.276
Maybe… maybe I was, you know,
trying to cover up a little of the damage

23:23.360 --> 23:27.364
so that I would look better
seeing you again and your new boyfriend.

23:28.073 --> 23:32.828
Glad I got to avoid that one.
Craig notwithstanding.

23:32.911 --> 23:33.954
You look fine.

23:35.330 --> 23:37.332
My new boyfriend
would have been very jealous.

23:41.378 --> 23:44.339
And if it's what you really want,
you can buy me out of the apartment.

23:48.969 --> 23:52.305
-It is. Thank you.

23:52.389 --> 23:54.474
-You seem really good, you know?

23:54.558 --> 23:57.477
Different. I mean, not that you didn't
feel-- well, seem good before--

23:57.561 --> 23:58.728
-No, I know.
-Okay.

23:58.812 --> 24:00.814
-I guess I am a little different.

24:00.897 --> 24:03.650
How could I not be?

24:08.071 --> 24:11.408
-Right.

24:11.491 --> 24:13.952
Well, I'm gonna say my goodbyes
and head out.

24:15.245 --> 24:17.622
Thanks for the heads-up
that you're leaving this time.

24:18.123 --> 24:19.207
-Right.

24:19.291 --> 24:22.794
-It was nice seeing you, Michael. Really.

24:22.878 --> 24:23.920
-Same here.
-Yeah.

24:26.840 --> 24:31.011
-You smell good. You always did.

24:31.094 --> 24:33.889
-You take care, handsome.
-You too, handsomer.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.658
Oh, here he comes.

24:58.371 --> 24:59.873
What the fuck with the dancing?

24:59.956 --> 25:03.418
-That was some crazy shit out there.
-Are you getting back together?

25:03.502 --> 25:05.504
Of course not. Are you insane?

25:05.587 --> 25:08.465
Well, it was nice
seeing the two of you like that.

25:08.548 --> 25:11.343
It was nice.
I think we can actually be friends.

25:11.426 --> 25:13.178
Not now, but someday.

25:13.261 --> 25:14.638
Really? What happened?

25:14.721 --> 25:18.225
I don't know.
It didn't hurt like it used to.

25:18.308 --> 25:21.645
It feels like the bleeding
has finally stopped.

25:21.728 --> 25:22.896
What about the apartment?

25:23.688 --> 25:24.606
He says I can stay.

25:24.689 --> 25:26.858
Have you tried the cake? It's gluten-free.

25:26.942 --> 25:27.984
-Ugh!
-Hideous!

25:28.068 --> 25:29.486
It's like the chicken with icing.

25:29.569 --> 25:32.739
-What time is the doctor on Monday?
-Noon. Billy's going too.

25:33.323 --> 25:35.408
Really? Cool. Hey, where's Wyatt?

25:35.492 --> 25:36.743
-Oh…
-Uh…

25:36.826 --> 25:38.328
I may have shit the bed on that one.

25:38.411 --> 25:41.706
I won. I want you all to pay me my money.

25:41.790 --> 25:43.750
-Were you all taking bets?
-I don't have any dough.

25:43.833 --> 25:45.544
-Wait, I liked Wyatt!
-There's no bet to me.

25:45.627 --> 25:47.003
-I told you.
-Everybody liked Wyatt.

25:47.087 --> 25:48.713
So why isn't he still here?

25:48.797 --> 25:53.134
Because someone doesn't know
how to treat a man.

26:48.565 --> 26:52.944
Excuse me, sir.

26:53.028 --> 26:57.657
Can you head back downtown?
I want to go to L'Express.

27:03.622 --> 27:06.291
Thanks.

27:24.601 --> 27:27.896
Oh my God.

27:50.335 --> 27:53.004
Jesus Christ!
You scared the shit out of me!

27:54.255 --> 27:55.632
What are you doing here?

27:56.508 --> 27:57.342
I think…

27:59.344 --> 28:00.845
I think I made a mistake.
