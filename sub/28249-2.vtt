00:01.156 --> 00:02.679
<i>Previously on "The Village"...</i>

00:02.742 --> 00:04.187
<i>Staff Sergeant Porter.</i>

00:04.265 --> 00:07.413
<i>The whole building is very
excited to have you, son.</i>

00:07.515 --> 00:09.990
This is the first day
of the rest of your life.

00:10.550 --> 00:14.053
<i>Katie, what's been
going on with you lately?</i>

00:14.231 --> 00:15.954
I'm pregnant.

00:17.162 --> 00:19.096
<i>I don't want to live there, Gabie</i>

00:19.225 --> 00:20.826
<i>Well, what's the alternative?</i>

00:21.604 --> 00:23.529
It's a one bedroom. I got a girlfriend.

00:23.760 --> 00:25.903
<i>- There's a warrant.</i>
- She's legal.

00:25.940 --> 00:27.733
- I know her, she's my neighbor.
- Mom?

00:27.767 --> 00:30.502
<i>Patricia, I can't practice
law yet, I'm in law school.</i>

00:30.537 --> 00:33.038
She's out neighbor, Gabe. We help.

00:33.073 --> 00:34.602
So...

00:34.817 --> 00:36.585
good news?

00:36.776 --> 00:40.512
32 years, a man can feel
when something is wrong.

00:40.616 --> 00:43.015
- Patricia, what is it?
- It's just a hard day.

00:43.236 --> 00:46.635
<i>- Nick, when you meet Katie...
- Actually, I already did.</i>

00:46.672 --> 00:47.753
I like your shirt.

00:47.787 --> 00:50.189
Yeah, I have a lot of issues with war.

00:50.405 --> 00:52.458
- Me too.
- Did you tell her?

00:52.492 --> 00:55.732
There wasn't really a great segue into,

00:55.995 --> 00:57.362
"I'm your dad."

01:37.103 --> 01:39.429
Hey, buddy.

02:02.033 --> 02:05.252
Morning, handsome.

02:08.477 --> 02:10.011
You wanna fool around?

02:12.180 --> 02:14.250
I think my grandson might be upset.

02:14.320 --> 02:16.508
I'm so, so sorry.

02:22.957 --> 02:24.557
What's wrong?

03:29.703 --> 03:31.103
Hey.

03:31.317 --> 03:32.768
Hey.

03:33.052 --> 03:34.539
How you doing?

03:36.456 --> 03:38.314
Split second when I woke up

03:38.351 --> 03:41.521
and forgot I was pregnant
was pretty clutch.

03:41.794 --> 03:44.196
Kinda downhill from there.

03:44.935 --> 03:46.869
What are you thinking?

03:47.921 --> 03:50.456
That I miss being little.

03:50.803 --> 03:53.976
When you would solve my
problems with dance breaks.

03:54.173 --> 03:55.906
I am an amazing dancer.

03:55.968 --> 03:58.039
Definitely committed.

04:01.314 --> 04:04.349
I love you, you know that?

04:06.154 --> 04:07.755
Good.

04:08.102 --> 04:10.437
Because we need to go
to the doctor today, baby.

04:10.705 --> 04:12.639
Talk options.

04:14.527 --> 04:15.922
Mom?

04:16.296 --> 04:18.411
Yeah, honey. What is it?

04:19.468 --> 04:20.833
I'm gonna barf.

04:20.946 --> 04:23.114
Oof. Run, run, run, run.

04:25.922 --> 04:27.973
You're coming to work today.

04:28.162 --> 04:30.885
- Why?
- Because you were suspended.

04:31.878 --> 04:34.313
My little pregnant vandal.

04:36.089 --> 04:37.689
We made it, buddy.

04:37.951 --> 04:39.751
You rest, I'm gonna try something.

05:09.540 --> 05:10.673
I can't do this.

05:10.817 --> 05:12.529
I have a heightened sense of smell.

05:12.674 --> 05:14.919
And when left alone you have sex.

05:15.063 --> 05:17.197
It's not like
I can get knocked up twice.

05:17.247 --> 05:19.114
Exactly.

05:19.357 --> 05:20.444
Ew, mom.

05:20.526 --> 05:21.905
Could you stop?

05:22.013 --> 05:23.795
Hey, Nick!

05:24.554 --> 05:26.521
Just, uh, practicing my limp.

05:26.666 --> 05:28.467
It's getting good. Katie, take the dog.

05:28.501 --> 05:29.841
- Put your arm around me. Here.
- Hi.

05:29.878 --> 05:31.136
Hey.

05:31.170 --> 05:33.490
Bridge looked a lot closer
from the roof.

05:33.606 --> 05:35.022
You walked all the way to the bridge?

05:35.100 --> 05:37.199
Except for the part
where I tried running.

05:37.343 --> 05:38.746
Nick.

05:39.022 --> 05:41.090
Well, we'll consider this payback

05:41.275 --> 05:43.165
for that time you sprained your ankle.

05:43.449 --> 05:44.857
Piggybacked you all the way home.

05:44.957 --> 05:46.258
Uh, if I recall,

05:46.295 --> 05:48.520
you piggybacked me in
the opposite direction of home

05:48.554 --> 05:50.722
and I got busted for breaking curfew.

05:50.826 --> 05:52.427
You got grounded for that?

05:52.592 --> 05:53.980
Yeah.

05:54.193 --> 05:55.995
For 17 years.

05:58.531 --> 06:00.035
It was that night?

06:00.772 --> 06:02.478
I don't really know.

06:05.772 --> 06:07.419
- I'm good.
- You sure?

06:07.456 --> 06:09.948
Yeah, no, I got it. Um, thank you.

06:11.444 --> 06:12.677
And thank you.

06:12.774 --> 06:15.097
If you live here, you're family.

06:16.466 --> 06:18.033
So I keep hearing.

06:27.460 --> 06:29.542
- Sixes?
- Uh...

06:29.729 --> 06:31.396
go fish.

06:31.483 --> 06:33.050
Go fish!

06:36.736 --> 06:39.271
Oh, no. That's... that's not a six.

06:39.305 --> 06:41.206
That's an upside down nine.

06:41.240 --> 06:42.707
Time for what?

06:42.742 --> 06:44.876
Your sister's not very good at cards.

06:44.911 --> 06:48.113
Oh, Katie is my daughter, Mrs. Kang.

06:50.450 --> 06:51.650
Well, I feel judged.

06:51.684 --> 06:53.401
Maybe we should really rock her world.

06:53.474 --> 06:55.787
About that, I talked
to the obstetricians office

06:55.822 --> 06:57.456
and they can fit us in
on my lunch break.

06:57.490 --> 06:59.291
Do you have any queens?

06:59.402 --> 07:02.193
Long Island, and stop talking and play.

07:02.230 --> 07:04.896
Katie, I want you to know

07:04.931 --> 07:06.898
there's no wrong decision here.

07:06.933 --> 07:09.120
If ending things is what you want

07:09.236 --> 07:10.949
you will not be judged by me.

07:11.003 --> 07:13.223
Hey, Sarah,
they're looking for you on two.

07:13.913 --> 07:15.914
We can talk later?

07:16.609 --> 07:19.077
Why didn't you end things?

07:19.228 --> 07:21.662
Why did you decide to have me?

07:22.608 --> 07:25.744
I will tell you that story, I promise.

07:25.997 --> 07:29.333
But I can't now. This isn't about me.

07:32.424 --> 07:34.025
Pinochle!

07:34.168 --> 07:36.069
You win!

07:42.083 --> 07:44.651
You probably made his day.
You all right?

07:44.804 --> 07:46.533
- No.
- Don't be upset.

07:46.806 --> 07:49.038
- Where are my espresso cups?
- In storage.

07:49.075 --> 07:50.942
Why not just light
all my things on fire.

07:51.031 --> 07:52.998
I don't make espresso.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.741
Uh, what is he doing here?

07:56.816 --> 07:59.075
It was just for the night.
His friend died.

07:59.173 --> 08:00.785
Well, he lives in a nursing home.

08:00.820 --> 08:02.912
A friend probably dies every day.

08:02.989 --> 08:04.173
That's cheery.

08:04.210 --> 08:05.790
Do you got something against milk?

08:05.825 --> 08:07.082
Use the oat milk.

08:07.134 --> 08:08.403
How the hell do you milk an oat?

08:08.440 --> 08:09.840
Without a factory farm.

08:09.996 --> 08:11.796
Go easy. He's, like, 90.

08:11.916 --> 08:14.384
Gabe, you have
a huge test this morning.

08:14.551 --> 08:17.053
You always let people
take advantage of you.

08:18.938 --> 08:21.072
Please tell me you're not
skipping this test.

08:21.195 --> 08:22.674
I'm handling a bond hearing

08:22.708 --> 08:24.075
for a neighbor who got picked up by ICE

08:24.110 --> 08:25.705
and I need to fill her in on her case

08:25.742 --> 08:28.106
- before she stands up in court.
- You're not a lawyer, yet.

08:28.143 --> 08:30.063
Immigration detainees
aren't given public defenders.

08:30.099 --> 08:32.234
What am I supposed to do?

08:32.549 --> 08:34.745
I'll find a way to get to everything.

08:35.221 --> 08:36.403
Even me?

08:36.556 --> 08:38.201
Espresso!

08:40.025 --> 08:42.660
Um, no thank you,

08:42.695 --> 08:44.431
but it was nice to...

08:44.852 --> 08:46.453
see you.

08:51.737 --> 08:53.238
Your Nonna wouldn't have liked her.

08:53.326 --> 08:55.925
- Why not?
- She's as cold as her grip.

08:56.742 --> 08:58.276
Wait, what did she grip?

09:00.313 --> 09:01.527
Pops?

09:02.885 --> 09:05.019
All right! All right.

09:05.218 --> 09:07.352
Tell whoever that is,
they're getting evicted.

09:07.543 --> 09:09.354
Don't worry,
I'll give you a rain check.

09:12.892 --> 09:14.813
I need to ask a favor.

09:15.211 --> 09:17.307
A man who's been forging documentation

09:17.344 --> 09:18.972
for immigrants was arrested.

09:19.009 --> 09:20.492
They've been rounding up all the names

09:20.529 --> 09:21.549
they found in his things.

09:21.586 --> 09:23.656
- Yours was one of them.
- What are these?

09:23.774 --> 09:25.870
Letters from Irani professors

09:26.034 --> 09:27.872
who apparently don't exist,

09:28.141 --> 09:30.542
stating that you were
a political dissident

09:30.576 --> 09:32.497
whose life was in danger.

09:32.912 --> 09:34.597
Your ex-husband submitted those

09:34.634 --> 09:37.231
with your application for asylum.

09:44.476 --> 09:45.874
I didn't know.

09:45.991 --> 09:47.296
Weren't you interviewed?

09:47.358 --> 09:50.228
My ex-husband arranged
for the translator.

09:50.365 --> 09:52.555
He could have been saying anything.

09:55.460 --> 09:57.791
Let's just focus on today, hmm?

09:57.937 --> 09:59.771
Proving that you're not a flight risk

09:59.805 --> 10:01.273
and getting bond granted

10:01.307 --> 10:02.907
so that you can fight this from home.

10:02.942 --> 10:05.076
And why would the judge believe me.

10:05.753 --> 10:07.487
I'm already a liar.

10:08.666 --> 10:10.642
In my experience...

10:11.350 --> 10:14.015
it's never too late to tell the truth.

10:20.960 --> 10:23.828
So we're looking at...

10:23.863 --> 10:25.930
14 weeks.

10:26.064 --> 10:27.766
Oh, no. That can't be right.

10:27.800 --> 10:28.800
She's not even showing.

10:28.834 --> 10:30.669
A lot of women don't show
until four months.

10:30.703 --> 10:32.103
Especially the first.

10:32.517 --> 10:36.174
How could she possibly
not know until 14 weeks.

10:38.132 --> 10:40.679
Why don't I give you two a moment.

10:47.153 --> 10:48.882
How long have you known?

10:49.108 --> 10:51.456
I took a test seven weeks ago.

10:52.925 --> 10:54.592
Seven weeks?

10:55.640 --> 10:58.375
Seven weeks and you just...

10:58.597 --> 11:00.131
you just decided to keep it?

11:00.233 --> 11:03.347
I just never decided not to.

11:03.669 --> 11:06.705
I know it's still possible, but...

11:08.796 --> 11:10.264
I can't...

11:10.423 --> 11:13.425
I can't do what you were hoping
I would do now.

11:14.413 --> 11:16.858
I didn't say I was hoping for anything.

11:16.953 --> 11:18.520
You didn't have to.

11:23.102 --> 11:25.455
Why didn't you tell me yesterday?

11:27.426 --> 11:29.828
You always say that the day
you told your mother

11:29.862 --> 11:31.663
was the day you lost her.

11:33.766 --> 11:35.787
I just wanted one more day.

11:48.100 --> 11:51.701
Zero to handsome in 60 seconds.

11:55.397 --> 11:58.050
Hope you're showing Bernie
a good time up there,

11:58.147 --> 12:01.471
as in pasta fagioli and a nice Chianti.

12:01.986 --> 12:03.953
Don't let him get any ideas.

12:11.808 --> 12:14.310
The military pension
oughta cover a Sherpa.

12:15.293 --> 12:17.294
- Can I help?
- All good.

12:17.478 --> 12:19.529
Planning on just throwing them
down the next flight anyway.

12:19.564 --> 12:21.798
Where you headed?

12:21.947 --> 12:24.768
Uh, smalls. Meeting a former teammate.

12:24.802 --> 12:26.903
Well, come on. You can share my ride.

12:31.872 --> 12:33.706
And by ride you meant...

12:33.945 --> 12:36.049
Old people bus. It's exciting.

12:36.147 --> 12:38.376
Last week there was a heart attack.

12:46.424 --> 12:48.058
Sending you back to the home, huh?

12:48.128 --> 12:49.933
I'll be okay.

12:50.092 --> 12:52.226
My Gabie's very busy.

12:53.316 --> 12:55.135
I can be a handful.

12:55.278 --> 12:57.146
Well, I hear eligible bachelors

12:57.183 --> 12:58.917
are a hot ticket in those places, so...

12:59.137 --> 13:00.815
Don't get me started.

13:01.312 --> 13:03.719
The grabbing, the whistling.
I feel like a piece of meat.

13:03.914 --> 13:05.383
Whoo. That tough, huh?

13:05.455 --> 13:07.489
I just wanna snuggle, they say.

13:08.250 --> 13:10.187
You can only make that mistake once.

13:11.963 --> 13:13.989
Oh, I almost forgot.

13:14.501 --> 13:15.935
Thank you.

13:16.633 --> 13:18.943
Paying for our car service.

13:19.580 --> 13:21.758
We gave my old roommate
a real send off.

13:21.877 --> 13:24.122
No, it's my pleasure.

13:24.495 --> 13:26.934
I lost some friends recently too.

13:27.398 --> 13:28.799
Heroes.

13:28.887 --> 13:30.441
Yeah, they were.

13:31.047 --> 13:32.948
Saved my life.

13:34.978 --> 13:36.931
Guess you better make it good.

13:37.383 --> 13:39.760
You're living for all of them now.

14:16.747 --> 14:18.548
Mom.

14:20.066 --> 14:21.582
Please, say something.

14:21.619 --> 14:24.020
You should go pick up
those prenatal vitamins

14:24.055 --> 14:26.048
and that other supplement
she mentioned.

14:26.085 --> 14:28.353
- DHA.
- You get this, right?

14:28.526 --> 14:29.893
I mean, you were in the same position.

14:29.927 --> 14:31.253
I don't have cash so take the card.

14:31.290 --> 14:33.696
I don't want your money, Mom.
I want you to look at me.

14:33.733 --> 14:36.069
I don't know who I'm looking at?

14:36.434 --> 14:37.834
Seriously, Katie.

14:37.869 --> 14:40.837
You took a pregnancy test
in front of me.

14:41.843 --> 14:44.611
- God, I'm stupid.
- You're not stupid.

14:44.709 --> 14:46.620
What else don't I know?

14:46.927 --> 14:48.291
- Nothing.
- Yeah?

14:48.328 --> 14:49.796
Who's the guy?

14:49.914 --> 14:51.882
The one you think likes you.

14:52.041 --> 14:53.375
Jagger.

14:54.152 --> 14:57.296
- I'm sorry, what?
- His name is Jagger.

14:57.765 --> 14:59.264
How old is he?

14:59.756 --> 15:01.006
My age.

15:01.084 --> 15:03.326
You think I would hook up
with some old guy?

15:03.539 --> 15:05.382
I think you lie to me.

15:07.533 --> 15:10.154
Guess we're not dancing
this one away, huh?

15:18.220 --> 15:21.661
I told Ron I'd help
with inventory at Smalls.

15:24.094 --> 15:26.161
I'll pick you up after work.

15:47.505 --> 15:50.163
Hey, there he is.

15:50.324 --> 15:51.491
Get over here, brother.

15:51.528 --> 15:53.392
Deacon, it's good to see you, pal.

15:54.022 --> 15:55.812
Something's different. Uh, haircut?

15:55.846 --> 15:57.328
- Leg cut. Off.
- Oh, yeah, that's right.

15:57.365 --> 15:58.748
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
see, what'd I tell you

15:58.783 --> 15:59.950
about those chemical peels, huh?

15:59.984 --> 16:01.703
I'm a slave to beauty, brother.

16:01.953 --> 16:03.920
Hey, Joe. This is Nick Porter.

16:04.024 --> 16:05.544
Nice to put a face with the name.

16:05.654 --> 16:07.879
Joe leads the support group
that you're too macho for.

16:07.976 --> 16:09.644
Well, no offense.

16:09.681 --> 16:11.061
I just prefer brooding.

16:11.147 --> 16:12.343
Good luck with that.

16:12.463 --> 16:15.966
And if you change your mind,
I left mine in Kabul.

16:16.053 --> 16:18.287
Looks like someone back
there's got a full set.

16:18.426 --> 16:20.005
Belly up, we're drinking.

16:20.385 --> 16:22.017
I'll make yours a double.

16:22.166 --> 16:24.641
You can use your employee discount.

16:24.752 --> 16:26.810
I don't actually work here.

16:26.844 --> 16:29.055
He keeps saying that.

16:29.092 --> 16:30.559
It's cute.

16:32.820 --> 16:34.221
To all the missing pieces.

16:41.592 --> 16:43.159
So a sergeant says to a private,

16:43.225 --> 16:45.313
"I didn't see you
at camouflage training."

16:45.529 --> 16:47.130
Private salutes and says,

16:47.164 --> 16:48.665
Thank you very much, sir.

16:48.789 --> 16:51.758
Guess you guys have heard 'em all, huh?

16:52.156 --> 16:54.904
Well, I'm all out of army jokes
and I got somewhere to be

16:54.939 --> 16:57.685
so if you want some more,
help yourselves.

16:57.820 --> 16:59.213
Hang on, you're leaving?

16:59.648 --> 17:00.853
What do we do if someone comes in?

17:00.890 --> 17:02.712
You pour 'em a drink,
charge a few bucks

17:02.747 --> 17:05.048
and ask them how they're doing.

17:06.028 --> 17:07.494
Man, what is with this guy.

17:07.865 --> 17:09.373
He knows a good thing when he sees it.

17:09.520 --> 17:10.854
Yeah, I should probably go too.

17:10.887 --> 17:12.321
I got another group in 30.

17:12.378 --> 17:13.878
You're more than welcome to join.

17:14.233 --> 17:16.468
- I'll keep it in mind.
- I hope you do.

17:16.608 --> 17:19.009
Courage under fire, you get medals for.

17:19.278 --> 17:22.570
Courage after fire,
you just get lonely.

17:23.948 --> 17:26.226
- It's good to meet you.
- You too.

17:26.318 --> 17:27.624
Thanks.

17:33.110 --> 17:34.741
Have you seen any of the other guys?

17:34.879 --> 17:36.468
Not since Cooper's funeral.

17:37.982 --> 17:39.215
How's Amy doing without him?

17:39.250 --> 17:41.751
I heard she bought a place in Queens.

17:41.819 --> 17:43.156
Thinking about going to see her.

17:43.193 --> 17:44.298
You should.

17:44.335 --> 17:45.444
I think you're the only one of us

17:45.481 --> 17:47.121
she ever actually liked.

17:48.051 --> 17:49.823
Don't worry, she doesn't know.

17:52.830 --> 17:54.431
Doesn't know what?

17:57.935 --> 17:59.359
Nobody told you?

18:02.132 --> 18:04.015
- Eh, forget it.
- Hey.

18:04.608 --> 18:06.427
Don't make me order you.

18:11.421 --> 18:12.955
You made a mistake.

18:15.689 --> 18:17.593
It's what got Cooper killed.

18:22.493 --> 18:24.175
The hell are you talking about?

18:31.630 --> 18:33.598
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.</i>

18:33.678 --> 18:35.640
<i>I am busy right now. What do you want?</i>

18:35.768 --> 18:37.502
They're taking me to a hearing.

18:37.708 --> 18:39.476
<i>You didn't say anything, did you?</i>

18:39.510 --> 18:41.663
Of course I said I had no idea.

18:41.799 --> 18:44.362
Ava Behzadi? It's time.

18:45.263 --> 18:47.517
You swore this wouldn't happen.

18:58.497 --> 19:01.166
Not the same without you, Bernie.

19:01.497 --> 19:04.185
Bernie was a candy ass little bitch,

19:04.222 --> 19:05.610
and so are you.

19:07.483 --> 19:08.702
Macklemore.

19:08.794 --> 19:11.641
Did I invite you
onto my side of the curtain?

19:11.675 --> 19:13.303
I will not have you here.

19:13.426 --> 19:16.262
It's not your call, you whiny wop.

19:17.937 --> 19:19.760
Where did that thing come from?

19:19.943 --> 19:21.217
Your anus!

19:21.252 --> 19:23.533
The rest of my stuff
will be up shortly.

19:23.721 --> 19:25.688
Now beat it!

19:36.272 --> 19:40.075
Hey, Bernie's grandson
sent you something.

19:44.737 --> 19:46.826
Sarah, where the hell you been?

19:46.963 --> 19:48.597
I got an emergency.

19:50.987 --> 19:52.716
Bath time?

19:53.188 --> 19:54.488
What's the emergency?

19:54.616 --> 19:57.251
That he's here. I won't have it.

19:57.574 --> 20:00.356
- This is sacred space.
- Come on, Enzo.

20:00.391 --> 20:02.125
This isn't the day.

20:03.060 --> 20:05.222
I pay good money.
You got to get him out.

20:05.259 --> 20:07.206
I have no say in roommates.

20:07.264 --> 20:08.998
Walt roomed with him.
You know what he did?

20:09.033 --> 20:10.500
He upper decked his toilet.

20:10.644 --> 20:12.527
I am completely powerless.

20:12.564 --> 20:15.099
I can do nothing to stop this, okay?

20:15.204 --> 20:17.805
Are we still talking about Macklemore?

20:19.543 --> 20:21.431
Katie's pregnant,

20:21.912 --> 20:23.901
and she lied to me about it.

20:27.455 --> 20:28.689
What are you doing?

20:28.825 --> 20:30.339
Looking for a Valium.

20:30.457 --> 20:33.329
- I don't want a Valium.
- How about a Klonopin?

20:33.416 --> 20:34.917
Will it take me back in time?

20:35.310 --> 20:37.481
What would you do if it did?

20:37.565 --> 20:40.234
Neuter some kid named Jagger?

20:41.386 --> 20:43.472
My son did everything at the right age.

20:43.527 --> 20:45.880
School, wife, kid.

20:46.237 --> 20:48.771
- You rubbing it in?
- He threw it all away.

20:48.933 --> 20:50.839
He left his family.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.609
My Gabriel.

20:52.914 --> 20:54.470
I'm sorry.

20:54.612 --> 20:56.312
The point is, who's to say

20:56.347 --> 20:59.063
what the right time for anything is.

21:02.953 --> 21:05.244
She said she didn't want to lose me.

21:07.458 --> 21:09.611
The fact that I didn't know.
Seven weeks.

21:11.662 --> 21:13.596
I think I lost here.

21:16.300 --> 21:18.342
So what are you doing here?

21:22.706 --> 21:25.920
Getting sage advice.

21:33.765 --> 21:35.699
<i>Pops, I've been in a test.
What's with all the messages?</i>

21:36.237 --> 21:38.304
<i>- Macklemore.
- What's a Macklemore?</i>

21:38.539 --> 21:41.474
An abomination. A travesty.

21:41.508 --> 21:44.077
- You're not making any sense.
<i>- Bernie's replacement.</i>

21:44.111 --> 21:46.913
My new roommate, he's a monster.

21:46.947 --> 21:48.381
Pops, I got to get to court early

21:48.415 --> 21:51.117
to try to talk
to the judge on Ava's behalf.

21:51.151 --> 21:52.785
<i>I can't deal with this right now.</i>

21:52.820 --> 21:54.027
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

21:54.064 --> 21:55.173
Okay.

21:55.235 --> 21:56.869
Hey, Gabie...

21:57.118 --> 21:58.458
go get 'em.

21:58.554 --> 22:01.790
Thanks, Pops. I'll do my best.

22:12.243 --> 22:15.241
Hey, how you doing?
Right. Dumb question.

22:15.276 --> 22:17.034
Listen, I have good news and bad news.

22:17.071 --> 22:19.292
The judge isn't going to let me
speak directly on your behalf

22:19.329 --> 22:21.081
but he'll allow me to walk you
through what to say.

22:21.118 --> 22:22.418
Quietly.

22:22.645 --> 22:24.456
I have to represent myself?

22:24.985 --> 22:26.419
Please tell me that was the bad news.

22:26.453 --> 22:27.987
The bad news is that the judge's son

22:28.022 --> 22:29.360
is a New York City cop

22:29.462 --> 22:31.544
who was knifed by an illegal immigrant.

22:31.992 --> 22:33.628
- Wonderful.
- Maybe it's an opportunity.

22:33.694 --> 22:35.428
He's a father, you're a mother.

22:35.661 --> 22:37.548
He's bound to be sympathetic, right?

22:37.665 --> 22:39.690
Your status as a mother
has very little bearing

22:39.727 --> 22:41.834
on whether this court should
consider you a flight risk.

22:42.087 --> 22:43.660
Kids can run, too.

22:43.923 --> 22:45.505
My son is in a school, your honor.

22:45.539 --> 22:47.239
I... I wouldn't do that.

22:48.048 --> 22:50.406
It's because you can't afford to.

22:52.126 --> 22:56.215
Your honor, as you can see
from these bank statements

22:56.250 --> 22:57.821
I live paycheck to paycheck.

22:57.891 --> 23:00.456
There is no benefactor
to whisk me away somewhere.

23:00.493 --> 23:02.823
The accusation against you
is you committed a fraud

23:02.860 --> 23:04.597
against the government
of the United States.

23:04.656 --> 23:07.508
I didn't realize
it was being committed.

23:08.153 --> 23:09.420
Please.

23:09.457 --> 23:12.428
Your honor, there are people
here on behalf of Miss Behzadi,

23:12.465 --> 23:14.318
- the super of her building...
- Mr. Napolitano,

23:14.355 --> 23:15.802
we agreed you were not to speak.

23:15.836 --> 23:17.050
I have no doubt

23:17.087 --> 23:19.457
that your neighbors
like you, Miss Behzadi...

23:19.740 --> 23:22.368
What about a New York Cop?
Can he say something?

23:22.611 --> 23:25.113
Mr. Napolitano,
this is your last warning.

23:25.829 --> 23:28.715
With all due respect,
you're trying to ascertain

23:28.752 --> 23:30.219
the likelihood that Miss Behzadi

23:30.254 --> 23:31.736
might do something illegal.

23:31.832 --> 23:33.967
A cop is an expert. Your son is a cop.

23:34.173 --> 23:35.981
Would you trust his judgment?

23:40.030 --> 23:41.681
Officer...?

23:41.965 --> 23:44.634
- Jones.
- Please step forward.

23:46.319 --> 23:49.255
- I assume you are familiar.
- I am, your honor.

23:49.312 --> 23:51.648
Is there anything you'd like
to say on her behalf?

23:53.515 --> 23:56.484
I live in the same building
as Miss Behzadi.

23:57.744 --> 24:00.446
I have for the past two years.

24:01.848 --> 24:04.568
She is a teacher...

24:05.120 --> 24:07.081
and a mother to a great little boy,

24:07.181 --> 24:09.602
which I guess
she probably told you that.

24:09.947 --> 24:12.072
What she probably wouldn't
feel comfortable saying

24:12.109 --> 24:16.346
is that she also is a good
and decent citizen.

24:17.935 --> 24:20.790
And I know this 'cause I moved
in near Miss Bezhadi

24:20.827 --> 24:22.695
after a personal tragedy.

24:25.671 --> 24:27.605
It was a low point.

24:29.580 --> 24:33.369
Ava... I'm sorry. Miss Bezhadi, umm...

24:33.617 --> 24:35.717
she would check in on me.

24:36.620 --> 24:39.885
She would bring me food. Ask after me.

24:42.459 --> 24:45.400
This woman is as good as her word.

24:45.923 --> 24:48.762
But you got more than her word,
your honor.

24:49.642 --> 24:52.126
You got a cop in the building.

24:56.699 --> 24:58.266
Keep an eye on her.

24:58.303 --> 25:00.671
In the matter of the
United States vs. Ava Bezhadi

25:00.844 --> 25:03.095
bond is granted and set
in the amount of $10,000.

25:13.156 --> 25:14.757
Thank you.

25:27.883 --> 25:30.260
I know we didn't get a chance
to talk much after the hearing

25:30.297 --> 25:32.565
but I figured
you'd want to know about Sami.

25:33.929 --> 25:35.763
How are you here?

25:35.938 --> 25:37.205
Pulled a favor.

25:37.302 --> 25:40.070
They'll give us a minute,
but how you doing?

25:42.165 --> 25:44.186
What good is a bond if I can't pay it?

25:44.221 --> 25:46.697
- I mean, it's $10,000.
- And that's the next hurdle.

25:46.734 --> 25:48.716
But today is a win.

25:49.262 --> 25:50.957
You're going to get out.

25:53.677 --> 25:56.501
Those things you said, Ben.

25:57.401 --> 25:59.535
I'm just looking out for number one.

25:59.642 --> 26:01.071
I mean, you in the big house.

26:01.134 --> 26:03.035
Got nobody pretending
they made too much food

26:03.072 --> 26:05.907
and bringing it by
so I don't go hungry.

26:07.444 --> 26:08.837
How's Sami?

26:09.843 --> 26:11.844
He's good.

26:13.169 --> 26:15.704
Little angry, uh,
not exactly talking to me.

26:15.801 --> 26:18.986
- But he's okay.
- He needs his night light.

26:19.046 --> 26:20.480
Yeah, I figured that one out.

26:20.629 --> 26:22.795
And he likes to be sang to at night.

26:22.895 --> 26:24.884
Yeah, not with my voice.

26:25.079 --> 26:28.373
I mean, I'll give it a go.
Just hope he likes Rihanna.

26:28.582 --> 26:30.116
Celebrity crush?

26:30.153 --> 26:33.522
Ri-Ri? Nah, we're just friends.

26:36.510 --> 26:38.236
Think it's time.

26:38.989 --> 26:40.597
It went too fast.

26:45.324 --> 26:46.978
I got an idea.

26:55.460 --> 26:57.371
Does your mom know you hang out in bars

26:57.394 --> 26:58.725
when you're supposed to be in school?

26:58.762 --> 26:59.923
I've been helping out

26:59.960 --> 27:01.561
for extra cash since I was a kid.

27:01.598 --> 27:02.932
Way back then, huh?

27:02.966 --> 27:04.935
I'm not in school
because I got suspended.

27:04.972 --> 27:06.224
You got suspended?

27:06.261 --> 27:08.545
I vandalized a defense contractor.

27:08.664 --> 27:11.021
Mm-mm. Something's missing.

27:11.833 --> 27:13.466
I hung up a crocheted heart.

27:13.503 --> 27:15.204
Mm, and there it is.

27:15.345 --> 27:16.664
Mm.

27:16.999 --> 27:18.686
Say, why don't you hit me?

27:19.331 --> 27:20.896
Too young to serve.

27:23.024 --> 27:24.404
Fair enough.

27:26.860 --> 27:29.595
You do realize we need
a military, right?

27:29.833 --> 27:31.794
I also realize that we have drones

27:31.828 --> 27:34.123
that drop bombs on wedding parties.

27:36.119 --> 27:38.054
Mistakes do get made.

27:38.127 --> 27:40.562
Yeah, tell that to the dead kids.

27:43.530 --> 27:45.431
What would you do?

27:46.810 --> 27:49.102
Say you knew about a jihadi bomb maker

27:49.139 --> 27:50.432
with a stockpile of supplies

27:50.469 --> 27:52.678
and the know-how
to kill hundreds of people.

27:54.030 --> 27:57.766
Pops up on your radar amongst
a handful of innocent kids.

27:59.140 --> 28:00.841
What would you do?

28:02.859 --> 28:05.087
I'd wait for him
to walk away from them.

28:05.395 --> 28:07.163
Maybe you get lucky.

28:07.983 --> 28:11.282
Maybe he gets into
one of ten identical cars

28:11.331 --> 28:13.298
going ten different ways

28:13.419 --> 28:15.987
in a territory you can never get to.

28:17.579 --> 28:20.457
How many innocent kids lives
are you responsible for now?

28:22.918 --> 28:24.454
Just one.

28:25.306 --> 28:28.355
I really wish I was bringing it
into a nicer world.

28:32.618 --> 28:34.419
You're pregnant?

28:35.811 --> 28:37.912
Uh, wait, wait.

28:39.673 --> 28:40.974
Does your mom know?

28:41.274 --> 28:43.008
She can't even look at me.

28:44.611 --> 28:46.025
Who's the boy?

28:47.093 --> 28:49.438
Guy I dated a few months ago.

28:50.925 --> 28:52.293
Past tense?

28:52.909 --> 28:55.211
We decided to see other people.

28:55.360 --> 28:58.263
It's senior year, so,
you know, you wanna be sure.

29:00.436 --> 29:02.014
That what you wanted, too?

29:05.273 --> 29:06.860
Well, have you told him?

29:09.396 --> 29:10.734
Let me guess.

29:10.977 --> 29:12.778
Your mom thinks it's a bad idea.

29:12.815 --> 29:14.001
Katie.

29:15.959 --> 29:17.071
I think we should go.

29:33.720 --> 29:36.379
All right, little man.
Got your pajamas on?

29:37.551 --> 29:39.619
All right. Brush your teeth?

29:42.040 --> 29:44.791
Well, I guess it's time for your song.

29:44.915 --> 29:48.837
And lucky for you, I'm not singing it.

29:50.069 --> 29:52.908
<i>Good night, my beautiful boy.</i>

29:53.696 --> 29:55.465
She's coming home real soon.

29:56.165 --> 29:58.098
Just thought I'd give you a preview.

30:25.099 --> 30:28.001
<i>Good night, my beautiful boy.</i>

30:35.939 --> 30:37.506
Oh, hey baby.

30:37.739 --> 30:40.519
Ooh, I wondered how long it would take.

30:40.748 --> 30:42.005
To what?

30:42.106 --> 30:46.184
For you to ask me about
giving Ava that $10,000.

30:46.294 --> 30:48.254
It wouldn't really be a gift.

30:48.489 --> 30:50.745
It's also why I'm here.

30:51.125 --> 30:52.358
And?

30:52.513 --> 30:55.536
And it wouldn't be responsible.

30:56.096 --> 30:57.433
Baby, the truth is,

30:57.470 --> 31:01.139
I've been robbing Peter
to pay Paul a bit.

31:01.682 --> 31:05.251
Yeah, the bar
has been bleeding our savings.

31:05.528 --> 31:07.707
But it will pick up.

31:07.934 --> 31:10.052
What?

31:10.342 --> 31:12.176
You laughing at my bid'ness?

31:12.213 --> 31:14.827
Man, come on. It's me, okay?

31:14.864 --> 31:16.582
What... what business?

31:16.617 --> 31:18.217
There's nobody in that place.

31:18.252 --> 31:19.974
Yeah.

31:20.661 --> 31:23.841
Okay, there are days
I come home, take a nap,

31:23.888 --> 31:26.692
I don't even lock it.

31:27.062 --> 31:28.834
At least if they took something

31:28.871 --> 31:30.263
we could get some insurance money.

31:30.297 --> 31:31.913
Whoo. Yeah.

31:31.950 --> 31:34.434
That bar losing money is not a secret.

31:34.575 --> 31:36.825
Oh, you got a better one? Mm-hmm?

31:38.455 --> 31:39.910
Well...

31:41.179 --> 31:42.880
In fact I do.

31:49.942 --> 31:51.879
The cancer's back, Ron.

31:53.088 --> 31:54.605
It came back.

32:06.371 --> 32:08.326
Sarah? What's the deal
with Pop's new roommate?

32:08.363 --> 32:09.764
I got, like, 12 messages.

32:09.801 --> 32:13.339
Uh, he was next
on the list for a corner room.

32:13.376 --> 32:14.600
Can you give him a different one?

32:14.637 --> 32:16.286
- Here, let me help.
- I'm fine.

32:16.434 --> 32:18.129
You've been drinking.

32:18.312 --> 32:20.897
Trust me, I've survived worse.

32:23.691 --> 32:26.027
Mr. Macklemore is just an instigator.

32:26.073 --> 32:27.217
He's trying to rile him up.

32:27.254 --> 32:29.936
Yeah, well, it's working.
Can't you get him someone good?

32:29.973 --> 32:33.595
It's communal living, Gabe.
They all drive each other nuts.

32:33.861 --> 32:35.706
He was lucky to live
with someone he loved

32:35.743 --> 32:36.910
for as long as he did.

32:36.947 --> 32:39.532
So he just gets who he gets?

32:39.695 --> 32:41.534
He lived with a wife he loved

32:41.671 --> 32:44.037
and then a best friend.

32:44.180 --> 32:46.729
I'd say he's had a pretty great run.

32:47.106 --> 32:48.773
Good night.

32:55.916 --> 32:57.189
Come on.

32:57.264 --> 32:59.237
Let's remind you
why it's nice to live alone.

33:04.540 --> 33:05.829
Gabe?

33:08.438 --> 33:09.605
Gabe?

33:17.302 --> 33:19.122
You left your door open.

33:24.079 --> 33:25.780
Had a feeling we were gonna chat.

33:28.582 --> 33:30.431
You can't give her advice on this.

33:30.509 --> 33:33.186
- I didn't give her advice.
- You asked if the father knew.

33:33.571 --> 33:34.838
Which is a question.

33:34.875 --> 33:37.148
From a father who didn't know himself.

33:40.064 --> 33:41.947
Come on, Nick. It's loaded.

33:42.079 --> 33:44.330
Please don't conflate this with us.

33:44.486 --> 33:46.156
How could I not?

33:46.673 --> 33:48.278
I mean, you didn't tell me.

33:48.315 --> 33:49.682
It wouldn't have made a difference.

33:49.719 --> 33:51.353
You don't know that.

33:51.504 --> 33:54.260
- Nicky, you made up...
- You don't know that.

33:55.542 --> 33:57.777
I know I wasn't enough.

33:59.422 --> 34:02.222
I know you were gone
before you were gone.

34:02.985 --> 34:05.853
You broke up with me, remember?

34:07.826 --> 34:09.833
You forced me to choose.

34:10.326 --> 34:12.194
And you chose war.

34:13.947 --> 34:16.129
You saw horrible things,

34:16.217 --> 34:18.043
and you were angry,

34:18.260 --> 34:20.005
and you chose war.

34:21.329 --> 34:23.302
Don't you dare rewrite history.

34:23.337 --> 34:26.139
I have put in 17 years.

34:26.172 --> 34:27.324
Alone.

34:27.360 --> 34:29.275
Still got the martyr act down.

34:32.791 --> 34:35.626
- How much do you drink?
- What?

34:36.126 --> 34:37.717
I invited you here to meet Katie

34:37.751 --> 34:39.219
and I don't even know you any more.

34:39.290 --> 34:41.786
- I'm not an alcoholic.
- What about pills?

34:41.960 --> 34:44.667
- I'd be in way less pain.
- PTSD?

34:44.704 --> 34:46.993
- I had a bad day.
- So did I.

34:47.195 --> 34:50.408
- I didn't spend it at a bar.
- I'm not an alcoholic.

34:51.188 --> 34:53.005
I don't even take anything
more than ibuprofen

34:53.042 --> 34:54.827
even though I lost my leg.

34:56.165 --> 34:59.839
And I don't know if I have PTSD
but yeah, sometimes, um,

35:00.126 --> 35:02.961
being in a crowd or on a roof

35:03.477 --> 35:04.750
or staring at these giant,

35:04.787 --> 35:06.288
street facing windows isn't easy.

35:06.423 --> 35:08.333
Now if that makes me unfit
to be Katie's father...

35:08.370 --> 35:11.469
- Nobody said you were unfit.
- Why aren't you telling her?

35:14.339 --> 35:17.120
- Because she's pregnant?
- Because she's gonna hate me.

35:17.769 --> 35:20.660
And right now she needs me.

35:23.886 --> 35:26.092
You think she's not going to hate me?

35:27.030 --> 35:29.802
You've known you were
her father for three weeks.

35:29.945 --> 35:32.091
I've known for 17 years.

35:34.178 --> 35:36.305
Don't worry, Sergeant Porter.

35:36.499 --> 35:38.647
You get to be the hero
in this story, too.

35:41.941 --> 35:43.775
Anything else?

35:44.122 --> 35:45.655
No.

35:46.420 --> 35:47.853
Nothing left at all.

36:05.921 --> 36:07.155
Hey.

36:07.247 --> 36:08.592
Catch.

36:13.383 --> 36:17.320
Nothing about keeping you made sense.

36:21.025 --> 36:24.061
You were conceived after 9/11.

36:24.663 --> 36:26.506
I didn't have any money.

36:26.634 --> 36:28.568
My family was a mess.

36:29.881 --> 36:31.681
The guy left.

36:35.244 --> 36:38.311
The guy had wanted to be a firefighter

36:38.386 --> 36:40.236
since he was a little boy.

36:42.476 --> 36:45.978
One month in
he ended up at ground zero.

36:48.539 --> 36:51.689
He saw things he couldn't
get out of his head...

36:53.642 --> 36:56.169
And I guess his priorities changed.

36:58.681 --> 37:00.107
The guy left.

37:02.869 --> 37:05.306
You never told me that part.

37:06.423 --> 37:08.924
I was pretty devastated.

37:11.368 --> 37:13.353
Made an appointment at a clinic.

37:17.423 --> 37:20.579
But I kept seeing
those towers fall on the news.

37:22.939 --> 37:26.008
People so scared they were jumping out.

37:28.477 --> 37:30.925
And I couldn't get it out
of my head that I needed

37:30.962 --> 37:34.508
to do something radically good
in their memory.

37:37.641 --> 37:40.146
I didn't know how to crochet a heart.

37:43.162 --> 37:45.407
So I gave birth to mine.

37:47.168 --> 37:48.662
At 18...

37:50.516 --> 37:53.018
without much to call my own.

37:54.407 --> 37:57.364
You were my radical good thing.

38:02.252 --> 38:04.353
I'm sorry I failed you.

38:06.721 --> 38:08.088
Katie.

38:09.310 --> 38:11.211
Hey, look at me.

38:14.085 --> 38:18.108
You will always be my good thing.

38:29.461 --> 38:30.961
What are you doing?

38:31.105 --> 38:33.967
In this family when there are problems,

38:34.001 --> 38:35.569
we dance.

38:35.889 --> 38:39.206
- Come on.
- We're really not very good.

38:39.277 --> 38:40.894
Maybe not, but...

38:42.448 --> 38:43.933
We are committed.

39:56.517 --> 39:58.800
Gabriel, what are you doing here?

39:58.837 --> 40:00.453
Taking you home, pops.

40:00.573 --> 40:02.155
You're gonna live with me now.

40:05.571 --> 40:07.034
<i>Up against the top rope</i>

40:07.071 --> 40:08.714
<i>and there's his signature move,</i>

40:08.751 --> 40:11.398
<i>the inverted space walk! But what...</i>

40:11.938 --> 40:14.401
Hey, what the hell?

40:14.688 --> 40:16.638
Suck it, Macklemore.

40:32.998 --> 40:34.698
Ooh, good shot.

40:37.959 --> 40:39.428
But wait...

40:39.560 --> 40:41.227
Sami steals the ball.

40:41.654 --> 40:44.531
Shot clock's winding down.
Oh, he's driving.

40:44.748 --> 40:46.756
He's faking left, he's faking right,

40:46.850 --> 40:50.203
and he get's tickled and he's
going for the dunk and boom!

40:50.482 --> 40:52.572
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Two points for the win!

40:52.990 --> 40:54.521
- The crowd goes wild!
- Whoo! Yeah!

40:54.592 --> 40:56.042
Whoo-hoo!

40:56.077 --> 40:58.044
- Put your hands up, son!
- Yeah! Yeah!

41:10.662 --> 41:12.946
- Boom!
