[distant crying
and music continues]

01:23.284 --> 01:26.552
-Does he always play
music when he bathes?
-I don't know.

01:26.554 --> 01:28.087
He's a romantic.

01:28.089 --> 01:29.221
I'm a romantic.

01:30.658 --> 01:32.424
-Oh, yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.193
[crying]

01:34.862 --> 01:37.629
Hold on a second.
Is he crying?

01:37.631 --> 01:39.598
Nah, he's singing.

01:39.600 --> 01:40.833
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.236
Kind of sounds like crying.

01:44.238 --> 01:45.871
Nah, it's bad singing.

01:47.408 --> 01:49.341
No, I'm pretty sure
that's crying.

01:49.343 --> 01:51.577
I think you underestimate
how terrible his voice is.

01:51.579 --> 01:54.213
No, no, no,
he's definitely crying.

01:54.215 --> 01:59.585
Maybe? But that's okay
though because crying's like his
thing. It's like you and yoga.

01:59.587 --> 02:01.620
[crying]

02:01.622 --> 02:04.223
Okay, seriously.
What is going on in there?

02:07.795 --> 02:11.263
Okay. You know the ex-wife
he's always talking about?

02:11.265 --> 02:13.732
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Um, she died.

02:16.470 --> 02:17.469
What?

02:20.674 --> 02:25.711
Yeah, it was a heroin overdose.
She was really into drugs.
Jason doesn't know that though.

02:25.713 --> 02:29.615
-Oh my God!
-Really bad news.

02:29.617 --> 02:31.583
-It's terrible news.
-Terrible news.

02:33.187 --> 02:34.353
Poor Jason.

02:34.355 --> 02:35.821
Yeah. Poor guy.

02:35.823 --> 02:38.190
-Oh my God!
-I feel really bad for him.

02:38.192 --> 02:39.391
I'm going to go check on him.

02:39.393 --> 02:41.927
Are you-- did you--
Did you finish?

02:42.930 --> 02:46.832
Yeah, it was great.
You didn't notice? I'm
going to check on Jason.

02:46.834 --> 02:51.303
Just let the man bathe and
grieve. His ex-wife died.

02:54.475 --> 02:55.507
[knocking on door]

03:26.974 --> 03:28.707
Hey, Jason.

03:28.709 --> 03:29.841
Hey.

03:30.978 --> 03:32.411
You're fine, right?

03:34.348 --> 03:35.647
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.351
Shannon, he's fine!

03:39.353 --> 03:41.453
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

03:46.227 --> 03:50.262
If we leave, you're
not going to, uh...

03:50.264 --> 03:51.964
-No!
-Yeah.

03:51.966 --> 03:55.467
-Okay. Yeah. No.
-No.

03:55.469 --> 03:57.720
Silly. I wasn't even going to...

03:57.721 --> 03:59.972
[Shannon] Does he want us
to bring him a <i> churro</i> doughnut?

03:59.974 --> 04:01.773
Yeah! No, he'd love one.

04:04.478 --> 04:05.510
Jason, listen.

04:05.512 --> 04:11.550
Like, if you need to,
you know, talk about all
of this that's going on,

04:12.853 --> 04:14.786
I would find you
someone who's qualified,

04:15.956 --> 04:17.856
because I'm completely
unqualified.

04:20.494 --> 04:21.426
Okay.

04:22.529 --> 04:23.528
Yeah.

04:25.633 --> 04:26.598
Yeah.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.285
Yeah.

04:29.286 --> 04:30.836
Can you-- close
the-- close the...

04:45.986 --> 04:47.753
¶¶¶

04:53.327 --> 04:54.860
Mm-mmm!

05:11.512 --> 05:13.945
[high-pitched voice]
<i> "Jippy Peanut Butter.</i>
<i> It keeps you hopping."</i>

05:18.085 --> 05:20.018
[music fades]

05:32.866 --> 05:34.966
[panting]

05:34.968 --> 05:36.902
[woman echoing]
<i> Jason! Jaaaason...</i>

05:39.840 --> 05:41.940
<i> Return the ring to me.</i>

05:43.544 --> 05:46.578
<i>We will be together in eternity.</i>

05:48.582 --> 05:49.948
[lightning striking]

05:49.950 --> 05:51.049
I will.

06:04.998 --> 06:06.765
[birds chirping]

06:25.986 --> 06:29.988
My turn. Okay. The
listing agent at the open
house asked me out.

06:29.990 --> 06:33.125
Really? What did he look like?

06:34.094 --> 06:36.395
He was Brazilian.

06:36.397 --> 06:37.963
I can't tell if you're serious.

06:37.965 --> 06:40.999
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.
-Brazilian?

06:41.001 --> 06:43.435
-Brazilian.
-Your turn.

06:43.437 --> 06:50.575
Well, yesterday at Denny's
I was at lunch and the waitress
gave me a free dessert.

06:51.645 --> 06:55.180
-That's your big secret?
-Yeah, it's been
a slow week for me.

06:55.182 --> 06:57.149
I have one more.

06:57.151 --> 06:59.985
Yeah? By all means
let's hear it.

06:59.987 --> 07:01.019
[knocking at the door]

07:01.021 --> 07:02.988
-[Jason] Mike?
-Yeah.

07:03.991 --> 07:06.758
Is it okay if I take
all the apples?

07:06.760 --> 07:09.461
Sure. Yeah. Take all the apples.

07:09.463 --> 07:10.462
Thank you.

07:11.565 --> 07:13.715
Okay, so what's the big secret?

07:13.716 --> 07:15.866
-I'll wait 'til Jason's
not at the door.
-He's not at the door.

07:15.869 --> 07:16.968
Mike?

07:20.107 --> 07:21.773
Do you have
any books on tape?

07:22.943 --> 07:24.676
Yeah, yeah, lots of them.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.780
I can't tell if you're serious.

07:28.781 --> 07:31.515
It's not 1995, Jason.
Nobody has books
on tape anymore.

07:31.518 --> 07:33.218
You can get it on your
phone, though.

07:36.723 --> 07:39.958
Okay. Wait. Jason,
what are you doing?

07:39.960 --> 07:43.195
I'm going to Salt Lake City.
For Yasmeen's funeral.

07:44.097 --> 07:46.465
-Your ex-wife?
-Separated.

07:47.167 --> 07:49.234
She came to me in a dream.

07:49.236 --> 07:53.238
She said "Return
the ring to me. We'll
be together for eternity. "

07:53.240 --> 07:54.539
[crow singing]

07:54.541 --> 07:58.477
Anyway, we're going
to renew our vows before
they put her underground,

07:58.479 --> 08:00.245
so we'll be together forever.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.549
It's pretty cool.

08:09.223 --> 08:12.591
I'm pretty sure he
needs psychiatric help.

08:12.593 --> 08:15.160
Yeah, I don't think he
should go on this road trip.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.162
[Jason going downstairs]

08:18.899 --> 08:20.832
[closing the door]

08:20.834 --> 08:22.033
What's the big secret?

08:22.970 --> 08:24.236
Um...

08:25.639 --> 08:27.072
I'm pregnant.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.643
[loud heartbeats]

08:32.279 --> 08:36.615
That's some big news.
That's some big, great news.

08:38.217 --> 08:39.818
I got to call some people.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.854
I'm so happy about this.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.858
So, why'd you decide to join me?

08:48.529 --> 08:50.295
I just think it's
really important.

08:51.832 --> 08:52.898
[Jason] Thank you.

09:00.807 --> 09:03.642
We've been driving for,
like, twenty minutes.

09:03.644 --> 09:06.878
Forty-five.
I have mild scoliosis.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.180
So, I have to stretch.

09:09.182 --> 09:13.151
I have to be limber
for when we get to Utah.

09:21.328 --> 09:26.164
Well, the viewing's
tomorrow night and
then the funeral is Monday,

09:26.166 --> 09:28.433
and then, on Tuesday,

09:28.434 --> 09:30.701
I'm going to try and
find an apartment
overlooking the cemetery.

09:30.704 --> 09:33.772
Why are you using a paper
map? Here, I have an app.

09:33.774 --> 09:35.807
[app] <i> Where are</i>
<i> you headed, friend?</i>

09:35.809 --> 09:38.777
Yasmeen and I always used paper
maps. It's how we travelled.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.812
Okay, but this is an app
that'll make things quicker.

09:40.814 --> 09:43.782
-"Turtle?"
-"The road traveled less."

09:43.784 --> 09:45.083
That sounds slow.

09:46.887 --> 09:51.256
So, we are going to make
a few stops along the way.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.992
Hit a couple of hot spots.

09:53.994 --> 09:55.160
[Mike] Okay.

09:55.162 --> 09:58.296
You can see the little
hearts there.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.098
[cell phone ringing]

10:03.003 --> 10:04.869
You going to get that?

10:04.871 --> 10:07.906
Nah. No. No.

10:10.644 --> 10:12.277
Mike, that's Shannon.

10:14.014 --> 10:17.616
Yeah, yeah.
Shannon's calling.

10:17.618 --> 10:20.085
Hey, watch out for
the-- um, dead skunk.

10:22.222 --> 10:23.188
Oh.

10:23.190 --> 10:27.826
Not sure how you missed it.
Maybe it's the map.

10:27.828 --> 10:30.328
You know this-- this is where
we first held hands.

10:31.365 --> 10:33.898
I was driving her to Vegas
for a bachelorette party

10:33.900 --> 10:35.367
cause her license
was suspended.

10:36.370 --> 10:37.702
I sure miss her.

10:38.872 --> 10:40.705
[cell phone ringing]

10:40.707 --> 10:46.678
So, Jason, you're probably going
to notice Shannon calling me
off and on. Maybe frequently.

10:46.680 --> 10:49.381
And I'm not going
to answer. And you
shouldn't worry about it.

10:49.383 --> 10:51.683
I'm not worrying about it.
You shouldn't worry about it.

10:51.685 --> 10:55.887
I appreciate that, but
she might be in trouble.
She's calling a lot.

10:55.889 --> 11:00.225
She is calling me a lot,
but you're going through
a lot and so for your sake,

11:00.227 --> 11:02.661
for you, I need to not
answer this phone.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.100
[cell phone calling]

11:12.105 --> 11:16.207
We're walking on the face of
Mars and I still have perfectly
clear service out here.

11:16.209 --> 11:17.876
Is it Shannon?

11:18.712 --> 11:20.562
Yeah.

11:20.563 --> 11:22.413
-Everything, okay?
-Yeah, things are great.

11:22.416 --> 11:24.783
I think I'm going
to break up with her.

11:24.785 --> 11:26.351
Really? Why?

11:26.353 --> 11:29.320
I just feel like
it's run its course.

11:30.757 --> 11:31.823
Hmm.

11:31.825 --> 11:33.575
What?

11:33.576 --> 11:35.326
I assumed between
the two of you, if anyone
would end it, it'd be her.

11:35.328 --> 11:38.129
What?! No.

11:38.131 --> 11:41.132
What?

11:41.133 --> 11:44.134
No, listen, I'm the
ultimate ender of things.
You know, I end it. Always.

11:44.137 --> 11:45.637
Hmm.

11:45.638 --> 11:47.138
You keep "hmm'ing"
me. Why do you
keep "hmm'ing" me?

11:47.140 --> 11:50.008
Hmm.

11:50.009 --> 11:52.877
The point is, you know,
it's been a solid dose
of commitment with her. And

11:53.914 --> 11:57.082
what comes next?
Marriage? And a family?

11:59.186 --> 12:01.086
This is a very
special place for us.

12:02.489 --> 12:06.725
Right before she left, Yasmeen
was really into hide-and-seek.

12:06.727 --> 12:10.028
-Hide-and-seek?
-Yeah, she'd run away.

12:10.030 --> 12:13.298
-I'd track her down.
She loved it.
-Ah.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.433
I'd find her in the most
amazing places.

12:16.403 --> 12:20.038
Seaside cliff.
Freeway overpass.

12:21.775 --> 12:25.777
The ledge of this parking
structure downtown.

12:25.779 --> 12:28.313
So, this game always ended
in really high-up places.

12:29.216 --> 12:32.083
Yeah. She liked the view.

12:37.257 --> 12:42.060
This was our room.
The King Kamehameha suite.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.833
We didn't get a lot
of sleep that night.

12:54.508 --> 12:57.242
-Cause of all the traffic.
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.212
Got enough.

13:08.522 --> 13:10.789
[Mike] Well, I guess
you shouldn't have
pre-paid that room.

13:10.791 --> 13:12.957
[Jason] It was going to
save me ten bucks a night.

13:15.061 --> 13:16.528
I got to go to the bathroom.

13:19.399 --> 13:21.332
[Mike] And the
adventure thickens.

13:21.334 --> 13:23.468
Maybe traffic will be
lighter when we're done.

13:26.840 --> 13:30.175
-Is that a nudie?
-No.

13:30.177 --> 13:32.477
-That was a Yasmeen
nudie on your phone.
-[Jason gulps]

13:32.479 --> 13:35.013
Jason, I saw Yasmeen
naked on your phone.

13:35.015 --> 13:35.947
No. Did not.

13:35.949 --> 13:37.081
-Let me see it.
-No!

13:37.083 --> 13:38.483
Just for the record, she's dead.

13:38.485 --> 13:41.286
There's spousal immunity
when it comes to photography.

13:41.288 --> 13:44.923
No, there's not.
You're ashamed
of her nude form.

13:48.495 --> 13:49.527
Okay.

13:55.869 --> 13:56.601
Oh.

13:58.438 --> 13:59.470
Huh.

14:00.974 --> 14:04.108
She's really just squeezing
them together there.

14:04.110 --> 14:05.476
Yeah.

14:05.478 --> 14:06.945
She knew I liked it.

14:06.947 --> 14:09.113
I don't think she liked
herself, though.

14:09.115 --> 14:10.915
She liked herself every night.

14:11.618 --> 14:14.018
-Are those bite marks?
-What?

14:14.020 --> 14:17.288
You know, I think
that's just a rash.

14:17.290 --> 14:18.890
I never bit her.

14:22.095 --> 14:24.162
Holy cow! Those
are totally bite marks.

14:25.498 --> 14:28.066
We were together
when she took that picture!

14:35.609 --> 14:38.576
I don't understand it. I don't
think she would do that.

14:38.578 --> 14:41.913
I don't know why. It
doesn't make any sense.

14:43.116 --> 14:46.150
I think the trick in life,
Jason, is just not to
care about anything.

14:46.152 --> 14:47.585
[woman] Peter. Come here.

14:47.587 --> 14:49.487
You tell Shannon you love her.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.940
Mm-hmm.

14:51.941 --> 14:54.392
Yeah, but you can tell people
all kinds of things as long
as you don't mean them.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.095
Pregnancy scare?

15:01.401 --> 15:04.419
No.

15:04.420 --> 15:07.438
Okay. You know, I was
in the exact same spot
as you a few years ago.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.640
I went back.

15:12.479 --> 15:14.412
Never go back.

15:14.413 --> 15:16.346
-Did you pull a beer
out of your pocket?
-Yeah. I'm giving it to you.

15:17.350 --> 15:20.351
Pretty soon you're going
to be scooping shit out
of a six-year old's shorts.

15:20.353 --> 15:21.686
This is your future.

15:21.688 --> 15:26.391
-[woman] What are you doing?
-I'm communing with
people on the road.

15:26.393 --> 15:28.376
[man] I'm communing
with people on the road.

15:28.377 --> 15:30.360
-It's called civility, Deborah!
-I don't want it.

15:30.363 --> 15:33.331
Oh, man. Hot, hot.

15:33.333 --> 15:35.300
Oh! Excuse me.

15:37.003 --> 15:39.570
-What?
-I said, "Excuse me."

15:39.572 --> 15:42.440
Like, "excuse me" like
you want to talk to me,

15:42.442 --> 15:45.276
or "excuse me"
I'm sorry for bumping
into you, excuse me?

15:46.513 --> 15:50.081
Just excuse me,

15:51.518 --> 15:56.688
like uh, sorry for bumping
into you, I didn't want talk,
I was just being polite."

15:59.659 --> 16:00.591
Sorry.

16:03.997 --> 16:05.964
I have Asperger's.

16:05.966 --> 16:08.366
Oh. I'm sorry.

16:10.003 --> 16:11.336
It's pretty mild.

16:11.338 --> 16:12.470
Okay.

16:14.107 --> 16:15.306
Shoot.

16:15.308 --> 16:16.307
Ah.

16:17.344 --> 16:19.143
Your eyes are...

16:19.145 --> 16:20.411
-What?
-What?

16:21.648 --> 16:22.647
-I didn't say anything...
-Please.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.415
-No, I just...
-After you.

16:24.417 --> 16:28.152
I just said your eyes
are very clear and green.

16:31.658 --> 16:34.258
I don't know if that's
a sign of Asperger's.

16:35.762 --> 16:38.196
Or not. I don't think it is.

16:53.013 --> 16:55.046
¶¶¶

17:39.225 --> 17:41.225
[crows singing]

17:52.405 --> 17:54.539
[Mike] So much
for things clearing up.

17:54.541 --> 17:57.708
You know, I think the Universe
may be calling to you, J.

17:58.778 --> 18:00.645
I think we got
to go off the grid.

18:03.850 --> 18:06.217
<i> Where are you headed, friend?</i>

18:07.654 --> 18:08.553
No.

18:09.522 --> 18:12.256
Say it. Not a lot to lose.

18:20.733 --> 18:22.500
Route to Salt Lake City.

18:22.502 --> 18:24.502
<i> -Ambulating.</i>

18:24.504 --> 18:26.804
<i> Ambulating.</i>

18:26.806 --> 18:28.506
<i> All square!</i>

18:28.508 --> 18:29.574
<i> Let's go!</i>

18:29.576 --> 18:31.242
All right. Here we go.

18:31.244 --> 18:34.145
<i> Get along, little</i>
<i> doggies. Guhhuh!</i>

18:34.147 --> 18:36.747
[Jason] Please find a way
to turn off that music.

18:36.749 --> 18:41.285
[Mike] You know, I don't
actually think you can turn
it off. It's beta mode.

18:41.287 --> 18:45.189
<i> In one mile, turn left!</i>

18:45.191 --> 18:47.692
<i> Oh, no. Signal lost.</i>

19:02.809 --> 19:03.808
Hey.

19:06.846 --> 19:08.146
Hey.

19:08.148 --> 19:11.482
Actually, I saw
you back at the...

19:11.484 --> 19:12.617
I know.

19:14.487 --> 19:15.486
I'm Mike.

19:15.488 --> 19:16.721
Vaginia.

19:16.723 --> 19:18.356
Virginia?

19:18.358 --> 19:19.891
Vaginia.

19:19.893 --> 19:21.225
Less virgin.

19:22.228 --> 19:23.261
More vag.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.901
-So, what's up there?
-Freedom.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.336
Whoa.

19:32.338 --> 19:33.538
Come get some.

19:35.441 --> 19:36.874
[crows singing]

20:16.816 --> 20:18.349

[sniffing]

20:53.653 --> 20:54.785
Oh!

20:57.457 --> 20:59.590
At least he didn't do too
much damage to the car.

21:01.694 --> 21:02.693
Hey, what's in the box?

21:04.364 --> 21:05.696
You think you're ready?

21:06.599 --> 21:07.431
Yeah.

21:08.368 --> 21:09.400
Okay.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.643
-Be very careful.
-Okay.

21:19.979 --> 21:21.846
Now, you're going to want
to remove the twine.

21:21.848 --> 21:26.384
-Sure, uh...
-It's protective twine.
Just save that twine, please.

21:26.386 --> 21:29.320
Great. So, now you're going
to want to lift the latch.

21:29.322 --> 21:30.488
Okay.

21:30.490 --> 21:31.656
Nice and slow.

21:33.493 --> 21:35.893
Now, my favorite poem
is on the top.

21:39.432 --> 21:40.331
Oops.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.533
[suddenly breaking]

21:44.637 --> 21:45.836
[animal noises]

21:57.784 --> 22:01.252
[Jason] Go ahead.
Read another one.

22:01.253 --> 22:04.721
"The likes of me and the likes
of she. The most beautiful
girl you've ever seen.

22:04.724 --> 22:10.061
Never, oh never, shall
I ever dissever my soul
from the soul of Yasmeen."

22:11.664 --> 22:13.397
I think that's what
they call a sonnet.

22:13.399 --> 22:16.634
-You write that?
- Yes.

22:16.636 --> 22:18.069
That's some Lord
Byron level shit.

22:18.071 --> 22:20.338
I guess it's good you
never sent it to her.

22:20.340 --> 22:22.473
-No, I...
-That'll be thirty-eight even.

22:23.676 --> 22:29.380
You know, love is a lot
like my hand-cured elk
jerky. It goes real fast.

22:29.382 --> 22:30.781
I think I'll just take this.

22:32.418 --> 22:35.519
-Oh, were you
reaching for the...
-Yeah, yeah, I was.

22:35.521 --> 22:37.321
Cactus?

22:37.322 --> 22:39.122
You should try not loving
her for a while, bud.

22:40.493 --> 22:41.726
She's dead.

22:42.729 --> 22:45.763
Hmm. Well, shit happens.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.399
-I will be in the car.
-Okay.

22:53.439 --> 22:57.441
I like everything you got
going on in here with the
wisdom and the meats.

22:58.444 --> 23:00.845
And this guy. Can
I get this guy too?

23:00.847 --> 23:02.980
Hand-carved by Lakota.

23:02.982 --> 23:03.981
La what?

23:04.951 --> 23:06.684
¶¶¶

24:38.978 --> 24:39.944
Greetings.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.213
Can we help you?

24:42.215 --> 24:44.782
-What does your app say?
-What?

24:44.784 --> 24:46.234
TRTL.

24:46.235 --> 24:47.685
Does it say that
this is a highway?

24:48.988 --> 24:49.854
How did you...

24:57.230 --> 24:59.797
Are you MMGood69?

25:01.601 --> 25:02.900
This guy, actually.

25:08.274 --> 25:10.007
I have to update the database.

25:18.951 --> 25:20.851
¶¶¶

25:33.132 --> 25:35.165
She's hot, though, right?

25:35.167 --> 25:36.867
Who?

25:36.869 --> 25:38.035
That TRTL girl.

25:38.037 --> 25:42.606
She's like twelve years old.
And she has Asperger's.

25:43.543 --> 25:46.110
Yeah, but a lot of people
have Asperger's and
you can still have sex.

25:46.112 --> 25:50.814
Besides, this is the
desert. You can do
whatever you want out here.

25:50.816 --> 25:52.783
You could kill her.

25:56.222 --> 25:57.855
What are you talking about?

25:57.857 --> 25:59.690
The point is, just
because she Asperger's,

25:59.692 --> 26:01.258
doesn't mean you shouldn't
have made a move on her.

26:01.260 --> 26:03.861
I haven't made a move on
anyone in about seven years.

26:03.863 --> 26:05.162
Seven years?

26:06.265 --> 26:07.865
Yeah, since Yasmeen.

26:09.035 --> 26:11.135
I mean, women have tried
to put moves on me.

26:11.137 --> 26:12.703
Jason?

26:12.705 --> 26:14.838
Sorry! Married.

26:16.208 --> 26:18.576
-Excuse me.
-Taken!

26:18.578 --> 26:22.279
Married. Sorry.
Married. Sorry. Married.

26:22.281 --> 26:24.748
So, you haven't touched a single
girl since Yasmeen left.

26:24.750 --> 26:28.619
No! I haven't even
touched myself.

26:28.621 --> 26:29.753
[animal noises]

26:30.690 --> 26:31.956
What would be the point?

26:34.060 --> 26:36.160
If she's not around,
it doesn't work.

26:37.964 --> 26:39.964
It'll be a whole different
story when I get to Utah.

26:41.100 --> 26:44.034
Hey, I think there's something
really wrong with this cat.

26:59.318 --> 27:01.952
[Mike] I think we need to look
at it from his perspective.

27:01.954 --> 27:04.722
You know, he's just
a cat. Living his cat life.

27:04.724 --> 27:07.324
Doing things that
cats are prone to do.

27:07.326 --> 27:10.728
But then one day, he meets
a hot young lady cat.

27:10.730 --> 27:13.731
Cat tells him she's just
like him. Wants to chill.

27:13.733 --> 27:17.034
Have a lot of cat sex.
Hooks him with her cat magic.

27:18.137 --> 27:20.304
Starts feeling things.

27:21.273 --> 27:22.373
But it's a trap.

27:22.375 --> 27:28.245
She doesn't want to just have
cat sex. She wants a cat baby.

27:28.247 --> 27:31.815
And then, just out
of nowhere, pf!

27:32.718 --> 27:33.884
Run over.

27:33.886 --> 27:36.754
I guess what I'm
trying to say is,

27:36.756 --> 27:39.757
sometimes in life it's
better to just be put
out of your misery

27:39.759 --> 27:42.159
than face your grim reality.

27:43.396 --> 27:44.194
So,

27:44.196 --> 27:48.699
I think we should-- I think
we need to put him down.

27:48.701 --> 27:52.002
You do realize
that's not a cat, right?

27:52.872 --> 27:53.737
What?

27:58.878 --> 28:04.014
[app] <i> Keep going straight</i>
<i> for seven miles.</i>
<i> You're on the right path.</i>

28:04.016 --> 28:06.917
<i> In two miles, take a right.</i>

28:09.722 --> 28:11.388
<i> Turn right.</i>

28:13.459 --> 28:15.259
<i> Ambulating.</i>

28:15.261 --> 28:17.227

28:18.764 --> 28:21.131

28:22.268 --> 28:26.370
Yes, yes. No, no.
Other way. Other way.

28:29.975 --> 28:33.210
You know what?
I'm just going to go with,
that we're not lost. Okay?

28:33.212 --> 28:34.945
We're slightly off the path.

28:34.947 --> 28:38.716
And, really, it's
not the app's fault.
You know what it is?

28:38.718 --> 28:42.286
It's the fact that your car's
made out of the same stuff
they make gum wrappers out of

28:42.288 --> 28:44.254
and it's messing
with the signal.

28:51.263 --> 28:53.197
[dramatic music]

28:57.770 --> 28:59.770
This doesn't look like a road.

29:00.973 --> 29:03.941
I mean it's very
clearly a type of road.

29:03.943 --> 29:06.009
I think it's more
like a river bed.

29:07.146 --> 29:08.746
[Mike] You know,
it says it's a road.

29:09.515 --> 29:11.081
[Jason] I think it's a wash.

29:11.083 --> 29:12.883
[Mike] Nobody knows
what a wash is.

29:13.853 --> 29:14.985
[Jason] Here we go.

29:25.331 --> 29:27.931
[animal agonizing]

29:33.305 --> 29:35.205
That's the biggest
rock you could find?

29:35.207 --> 29:36.173
Yeah.

29:36.175 --> 29:42.880
-So just-- drop it on his
head, straight down?
-Throw it straight down.

29:43.816 --> 29:45.949
-What if I miss?
-Then we'll try again.

29:45.951 --> 29:48.135
What if it doesn't kill him?

29:48.136 --> 29:50.320
Then we just knock him out,
pop his head under the tire,
and then we'll finish it clean.

29:55.227 --> 29:55.893
Here, you're stronger than me.

29:55.894 --> 29:56.560
No. You need to learn
the full lesson here.

29:56.562 --> 29:59.063
You ran over him.

29:59.064 --> 30:01.565
You took his little life
into your hands, okay?
That's responsibility.

30:03.202 --> 30:05.169
-You're scared.
-No.

30:05.171 --> 30:07.004
You are scared to kill him.

30:07.005 --> 30:08.838
No, I'm not scared
to kill it. You just have
a lesson to learn here.

30:08.841 --> 30:12.943
Okay. Then I'll learn it
by watching. You do it.

30:14.013 --> 30:16.313
You stand the best chance
of doing it in one shot anyway.

30:18.484 --> 30:19.483
Okay, then.

30:23.389 --> 30:24.421
[exhales]

30:41.373 --> 30:44.842
So, I just-- drop it
on his head,

30:46.245 --> 30:47.311
straight down?

30:55.354 --> 30:57.154
[making noise]

30:58.424 --> 31:00.524
You know, I think
he could pull through.

31:03.929 --> 31:04.628
Yeah.

31:05.965 --> 31:07.164
He could recover.

31:09.368 --> 31:10.300
I think.

31:14.340 --> 31:16.206
Do you ever think about, like,

31:17.543 --> 31:18.909
true love?

31:21.080 --> 31:24.147
You know, I actually
keep pictures of all the girls
I've been with on my phone.

31:26.886 --> 31:28.318
It's the Lady Library.

31:30.656 --> 31:34.291
I got Niki nudies. Nattie
nudies. Judy nudies.

31:38.631 --> 31:40.130
It's all alphabetical.

31:41.934 --> 31:43.300
I keep like

31:44.136 --> 31:46.303
one picture of

31:46.305 --> 31:48.538
one girl on my phone.

31:51.577 --> 31:53.577
Yeah, but you should
delete that one.

31:55.114 --> 31:56.546
You ever been cheated on?

31:58.183 --> 31:59.249
No.

31:59.251 --> 32:02.552
Never. I've done a lot
of cheating, though.

32:04.590 --> 32:06.323
Did you ever cheat on Shannon?

32:09.361 --> 32:10.294
No.

32:15.968 --> 32:18.435
[Jason] Do you think she left
me because of my penis size?

32:19.939 --> 32:21.004
[Mike] I don't know.

32:25.010 --> 32:27.311
[heartbeats]

32:39.191 --> 32:42.192
[distorted voice] I love you.

32:42.194 --> 32:44.962
[distorted voice] Yasmeen.

33:10.990 --> 33:12.990
Oh. Oh. Oh, jeez!

33:20.199 --> 33:21.264
[animal noises]

33:27.339 --> 33:29.106
[car beeping]

33:43.288 --> 33:45.422
What in the world are you doing?

33:45.424 --> 33:46.590
We've gone off the grid.

33:47.626 --> 33:49.192
Disappeared completely.

33:50.529 --> 33:52.596
Shannon hasn't texted
me in over twelve hours.

33:52.598 --> 33:55.098
Yeah, the funeral
is tomorrow morning.

33:55.100 --> 33:57.167
Do you think my phone is broken?

33:57.169 --> 34:00.637
I've been waiting for six
years to find out whether
Yasmeen still loves me.

34:00.639 --> 34:03.774
And now, I know.
I'm not going to let
anything distract me.

34:05.044 --> 34:07.044
-What is that?
-It's a trap.

34:08.679 --> 34:10.647
Seems weird she hasn't
texted me, though. Right?

34:10.649 --> 34:15.085
No, I don't think it's
so weird, considering
you guys are broken up

34:15.087 --> 34:18.121
and there's probably plenty
of dudes trying to get with her.

34:18.123 --> 34:20.157
You think there's a lot
of dudes trying to
get with Shannon?

34:20.159 --> 34:23.193
Sure. She's an attractive girl.

34:23.195 --> 34:25.728
I mean, she's no Yasmeen,
but she's a solid nine.

34:27.399 --> 34:29.766
Have you ever been outdoors?

34:30.835 --> 34:35.072
I read a survival book,
so--<i> Into the Wild.</i>

34:35.074 --> 34:37.474
That's not a survival book.
He doesn't survive.

34:38.377 --> 34:40.110
I saw the movie.

34:40.112 --> 34:41.411
He still dies.

34:43.449 --> 34:44.748
I didn't see the whole movie.

34:47.252 --> 34:49.286
You know, you're not going to
be able to charge your phone.

34:55.360 --> 34:58.562
[Jason] This is-- interesting.

34:58.564 --> 35:02.199
[Mike] Well, it is the road
traveled less. T-R-T-L.

35:03.368 --> 35:04.668
[Jason] It's like the Goodyear
blimp had diarrhea.

35:09.842 --> 35:13.243
What in the world? The tank was
only half empty when we parked.

35:13.245 --> 35:17.547
Well, Jason, you got
to start looking at these
things as being half-full.

35:17.549 --> 35:19.449
Well, now it's just empty.

35:19.451 --> 35:20.383
I don't know.

35:21.753 --> 35:23.620
Is this even a road?

35:23.622 --> 35:26.556
Oh, yeah, I turned the car on
last night to charge my phone.

35:26.558 --> 35:28.525
What and you just
let the engine run?

35:28.527 --> 35:29.860
I didn't want
to kill the battery.

35:29.862 --> 35:32.129
Mike!

35:32.130 --> 35:34.397
Listen, we're never going
to get out of here if my phone
doesn't have any power.

35:34.399 --> 35:37.300
Well, next time,
how about you plug it in
when we're actually moving?

35:37.302 --> 35:40.770
It's okay. All right?
These tanks are good
for another fifty miles

35:40.772 --> 35:42.472
after reading empty. I promise.

35:46.245 --> 35:48.311
There's going to be
an oasis somewhere.

35:48.313 --> 35:49.713
What does your phone say?

35:52.317 --> 35:54.784
It's dead again.
Fucking grid.

35:54.786 --> 35:57.654
[Mike] Well, the app said
there's a lake, right here.

35:58.490 --> 36:00.257
[Jason] We're in a lake.

36:00.259 --> 36:04.294
We followed a wash
into a dry lake bed.

36:19.311 --> 36:20.944
This.

36:20.946 --> 36:22.746
This could be
a Yasmeen miracle.

36:22.748 --> 36:24.548
-Oh yeah?
-Yeah.

36:24.550 --> 36:25.949
Random broken-down
car in the desert?

36:25.951 --> 36:31.555
She's giving us a stepping
stone so I can get to her.

36:31.557 --> 36:32.689
Hello?

36:34.426 --> 36:37.194
-Oh!
-Ah!

36:37.196 --> 36:38.929
-[gulping]
-Yeah.

36:39.898 --> 36:42.933
No, I kind of suspected
something like this.

36:42.935 --> 36:44.834
I'm trying to breathe
through my mouth.

36:44.836 --> 36:46.469
Some Yasmeen miracle, huh?

36:46.471 --> 36:52.709
It's your fault we're following
the stupid app and I'm not
going to let that stop me.

36:52.711 --> 36:55.512
Okay. I merely suggested
the use of the app.

36:55.514 --> 36:59.683
You made the decision
to follow my suggestion and
that makes you accountable.

36:59.685 --> 37:00.850
Jason, come back here.

37:00.852 --> 37:07.290
You're walking aimlessly
in an endless direction.
There's no point... Jason!

37:07.292 --> 37:10.927
Jason! You're not even
walking in a straight line.
You're slowly curving.

37:10.929 --> 37:13.663
I'm devoted, not delusional.

37:13.665 --> 37:15.732
[epic music]

38:05.617 --> 38:06.983
It says this is a road.

38:08.754 --> 38:10.720
It's not.

38:10.722 --> 38:11.788
No shit.

38:12.624 --> 38:13.657
Where's your pal?

38:15.694 --> 38:17.494
You know, the charming one?

38:19.965 --> 38:21.598
[epic music]

38:34.613 --> 38:36.079
[music distorting]

38:42.054 --> 38:43.787
[music ends]

38:48.694 --> 38:50.660
[music box tune]

39:56.161 --> 39:57.427
[screaming]

39:57.429 --> 39:58.094
[thump]

39:58.964 --> 40:00.830
[heartbeats]

40:04.970 --> 40:06.770
[Jason lightly moaning]

40:08.907 --> 40:09.873
Mike?

40:11.009 --> 40:12.742
Jason, how did you
even get up here?

40:13.678 --> 40:15.044
We've been looking
for you for hours.

40:15.046 --> 40:20.583
Hey, this is Zannah.
Remember her?
The geographical surveyor?

40:20.585 --> 40:23.553
She's going to take us
to a gas station, Jason.
It's going to be, okay.

40:23.555 --> 40:26.089
After I finish my rounds.

40:26.091 --> 40:31.127
TRTL uses satellite imagery
and it's been mistaking
roads for washes a lot lately

40:31.129 --> 40:33.997
and leading people
into them. Supposedly.

40:35.066 --> 40:37.033
I mean, clearly,
it's doing exactly that.

40:37.702 --> 40:40.570
Jason, I know you warned
me on the app. I'm with
you now. It was a bad idea.

40:40.572 --> 40:43.206
You look like my grandma after
she gets out of the shower.

40:44.743 --> 40:46.943
We're going to miss
the viewing tonight, aren't we?

40:51.650 --> 40:52.649
Mm.

40:55.854 --> 41:00.190
It's a wash, guys.
It was never a road.

41:00.192 --> 41:01.691
Probably never will be.

41:03.829 --> 41:05.662
Oh. It looks like your
buddy's feeling better.

41:09.734 --> 41:10.800
He's gone.

41:10.802 --> 41:11.868
[Zannah screaming]

41:30.255 --> 41:33.223
This wasn't one
of those emotional
support animals, was it?

41:45.070 --> 41:46.836
Where are you guys headed?

41:46.838 --> 41:52.942
Salt Lake City. So, my friend
Jason here can go to the
funeral of his ex-wife.

41:52.944 --> 41:56.813
Wife-- we separated-- died.

41:59.518 --> 42:01.084
[Zannah] I go to
concerts sometimes.

42:01.920 --> 42:03.786
-You ever been to a
Three Doors Down concert?
-No.

42:05.223 --> 42:06.623
It sounds weird.

42:07.526 --> 42:10.093
We only have country
music out here.

42:10.095 --> 42:11.261
And western.

42:12.230 --> 42:16.232
Sometimes country-western.

42:16.234 --> 42:18.134
One time I wrote a country song.

42:18.136 --> 42:20.270
That's cool. I think.

42:20.272 --> 42:23.239
Yeah. It was after Yasmeen left.

42:27.712 --> 42:29.812
-I got to get out.
-Okay.

42:29.814 --> 42:31.180
I'll be back in three minutes.

42:31.182 --> 42:32.081
Okay.

42:35.854 --> 42:38.254
-All right. How
are you doing that?
-What?

42:38.256 --> 42:39.756
You're warming up her pussy.

42:39.758 --> 42:41.775
What? No!

42:41.776 --> 42:43.793
She clearly wants you in some
kind of like a sexual way.

42:43.795 --> 42:45.094
Let's just get to Yasmeen.

42:45.096 --> 42:46.896
I mean, the tension
was palpable.

42:46.898 --> 42:50.633
It's not my fault.
I told you, women are
always coming on to me.

42:50.635 --> 42:52.869
Well, I don't know about that,

42:52.871 --> 42:56.272
but we are in the desert
and things are really
skewed out here.

42:56.274 --> 43:00.109
Do you think that
she thinks that I think
I'm flirting with her?

43:00.111 --> 43:03.680
I definitely think that
she thinks, you think,
you're flirting with her.

43:03.682 --> 43:06.249
And honestly,
it's a little disrespectful to
the memory of Yasmeen.

43:06.251 --> 43:09.986
I'm not judging you;
I'm just saying that.
But no judgment.

43:09.988 --> 43:11.821
I'll just tell her
I'm not interested.

43:11.823 --> 43:14.324
No, no. No, no, no.
Don't do that.

43:14.326 --> 43:17.760
That'll just make her
want you more, okay.
You need to squash the spark.

43:17.762 --> 43:21.364
Why? Because I'm
squashed between your
two sets of raging genitalia

43:21.366 --> 43:22.966
and it's very hot in here.

43:24.035 --> 43:25.969
I don't think that's my fault.

43:27.005 --> 43:29.372
It is, though, Jason.
It is your fault.

43:29.374 --> 43:31.641
How am I supposed to squash it?

43:31.643 --> 43:34.243
Just sing her one of those
songs of yours, all right?

43:34.245 --> 43:38.181
That'll dry up even the
most moist of vaginas.
Just... [slurps]

43:40.352 --> 43:42.118
You got like a handful
of them, don't you?

43:49.861 --> 43:53.663
-Do you have an
iPhone charger?
-I use a satellite phone.

43:54.633 --> 43:56.165
And I'm always charged up.

44:01.306 --> 44:05.942
So, what brought you into
geographical surveying?

44:05.944 --> 44:09.379
I like the outdoors.
And I like maps.

44:09.381 --> 44:10.847
I like maps.

44:10.849 --> 44:16.819
I like the bumpy roads,
too. Sometimes I
make noises on them.

44:18.957 --> 44:25.662
Ahh!

44:41.446 --> 44:45.415
<i> ¶ I've been coming here</i>
<i> For about a week ¶</i>

44:47.252 --> 44:50.286
<i> ¶ Talking to you</i>
<i> Is my little treat ¶</i>

44:51.890 --> 44:54.891
<i> ¶ Besides the beam</i>
<i> You're the only thing I like ¶</i>

44:54.893 --> 44:57.360
<i> ¶ About this bar ¶</i>

44:58.697 --> 45:02.465

<i> The most perceptive guy ¶</i>

45:03.835 --> 45:08.237

<i> Or a hand on the thigh ¶</i>

45:08.239 --> 45:14.043
<i> ¶ For me to even know</i>
<i> You know that I'm alive ¶</i>

45:14.045 --> 45:16.713
<i> ¶ I don't know</i>
<i> If you're being friendly ¶</i>

45:16.715 --> 45:19.716
<i> ¶ Or the kiss you blew</i>
<i> Means love me tenderly ¶</i>

45:19.718 --> 45:23.853
<i> ¶ How am I to know</i>
<i> To give a try? ¶</i>

45:23.855 --> 45:28.124
<i> ¶ Are you going to love me? ¶</i>

45:29.928 --> 45:33.362
<i>¶ Are you going to leave me? ¶</i>

45:36.868 --> 45:43.172
<i> ¶ Or are you going</i>
<i> To have to take my keys? ¶</i>

45:45.944 --> 45:48.344
<i> ¶ Is it a yes? ¶</i>

45:49.247 --> 45:51.981
<i> ¶ Is it a no? ¶</i>

45:53.218 --> 45:59.789
<i> ¶ Girl, just give it</i>
<i> To me straight up ¶</i>

46:04.295 --> 46:05.762
Yes.

46:13.805 --> 46:16.105
I don't think they're going to
have funeral attire here, Mike.

46:18.843 --> 46:21.477
Yeah, well, anything
is better than that.

46:22.514 --> 46:24.213
Oh, okay.

46:25.116 --> 46:28.484
Well, I'll try to find
something nice.

46:28.485 --> 46:31.853
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Try to find something nice.
That's what you should be doing.

46:31.856 --> 46:35.158
[Mike] And now we get to go all
the way back out to the desert.

46:48.506 --> 46:50.273
What you got there?

46:50.275 --> 46:52.074
Sorry.

46:52.076 --> 46:53.242
What you got there?

46:54.312 --> 46:58.381
Oh, it's Yasmeen's
treasure trunk.

46:58.383 --> 46:59.448
Oh.

47:00.518 --> 47:02.051
It has my love inside.

47:04.055 --> 47:05.087
Yeah.

47:06.191 --> 47:09.258
I mean, this is just poems and

47:11.029 --> 47:15.064
mementos and memories
from when we were together.

47:15.066 --> 47:17.500
But the most important thing

47:19.470 --> 47:20.403
is this.

47:21.306 --> 47:23.472
Yeah. Wow.

47:28.913 --> 47:31.180
Mike thinks it's crazy, but

47:34.485 --> 47:36.152
she came to me in a dream.

47:38.957 --> 47:42.091
She said,
"Return the ring to me.

47:43.094 --> 47:44.927
We'll be together for eternity."

47:49.434 --> 47:52.068
She said that I was the
one great love in her life.

47:53.037 --> 47:55.471
-Dang!
-Yeah.

47:58.243 --> 47:59.542
You really loved her.

48:02.247 --> 48:03.379
Yeah.

48:26.437 --> 48:28.271
I'm sorry about your ex-wife.

48:30.041 --> 48:30.973
Wife.

48:34.279 --> 48:37.113
Well-- well, she's
not alive anymore.

48:38.583 --> 48:39.682
Yes.

48:39.684 --> 48:43.486
I'm sorry you had to
drive us around all day.

48:43.488 --> 48:46.489
I'm sorry about the
whole raccoon thing.

48:47.659 --> 48:49.926
I'm sorry he attacked you.

48:49.928 --> 48:53.329
I'm sorry that we keep
saying sorry so much.

48:53.331 --> 48:54.964
[Jason chuckles]

48:56.601 --> 48:57.967
We are.

48:59.070 --> 49:00.202
It's, like, sorry!

49:00.204 --> 49:01.170
Sorry.

49:03.274 --> 49:04.473
Sorry.

49:05.677 --> 49:07.076
I said it again.

49:09.147 --> 49:10.279
Thank you.

49:11.716 --> 49:13.049
Thank you.

49:15.520 --> 49:18.087
I have to get to a funeral
and Mike's probably
done taking a dump.

49:19.424 --> 49:20.523
Okay.

49:25.029 --> 49:27.296
-Oh. It's just...
-Alright.

49:27.298 --> 49:28.631
Because... Oh!

49:35.373 --> 49:36.973
-Sorry.
-Thank you.

49:37.675 --> 49:39.008
Thank you.

49:39.644 --> 49:40.643
Thank you.

49:49.187 --> 49:50.553
[starting the car]

49:52.090 --> 49:53.990
<i> -Where are you at?</i>
-[music from app]

50:07.105 --> 50:08.404
Jeez.

50:46.411 --> 50:49.512
Well, that felt good.

50:53.151 --> 50:54.784
You get her number?

50:54.786 --> 50:55.684
No.

50:57.388 --> 50:58.387
Well,

51:00.058 --> 51:00.589
I did.

51:00.591 --> 51:04.393
Says she wants to get coffee,
so you know what that means.

51:06.397 --> 51:08.064
Hey, my phone works.

51:12.070 --> 51:13.803
[phone ringing]

51:16.574 --> 51:18.608
What, Mike?

51:18.609 --> 51:20.643
[Mike] <i> I know that from</i>
<i> your perspective, it looked</i>
<i> like I was running away.</i>

51:20.645 --> 51:24.547
And I was. I was running
away at first. But I was
going to come right back.

51:24.549 --> 51:29.485
But when I was outside,
I see Jason. And I mean,
you should have seen him.

51:29.487 --> 51:31.487
<i> How is he?</i>

51:31.488 --> 51:33.488
Well, I mean, you
were right, you know.

51:33.491 --> 51:36.559
He definitely needed
somebody. He needed me.

51:37.595 --> 51:39.629
No, I didn't.

51:39.630 --> 51:41.664
This is, this is a dumb
question, but I was...

51:41.666 --> 51:44.867
While I've been gone
helping Jason, you
haven't been, like,

51:44.869 --> 51:47.803
you didn't take the opportunity
to text other guys, right?

51:47.805 --> 51:49.694
Excuse me?

51:49.695 --> 51:51.584
That was a dumb
question. Admittedly.
That was a dumb question.

51:51.585 --> 51:53.474
Are you seriously asking me
that question right now, Mike?

51:53.478 --> 51:57.146
I've been out in the desert.
You wouldn't believe
what we've been through.

51:57.148 --> 51:59.548
I wanted to call you right
away, but my phone died.

51:59.550 --> 52:03.219
And that TRTL app I told
you about. Delete it off your
phone. It's not a good app.

52:03.221 --> 52:04.553
-It is a bad app.
-You know what, Mike?

52:04.555 --> 52:05.788
<i> It nearly killed us.</i>

52:05.790 --> 52:08.524
I don't even know.

52:08.525 --> 52:11.259
Honestly, I don't...
I truly don't expect you
to forgive me right away,

52:11.262 --> 52:15.231
but, you know, I'm going
to ask you to look deep
down, because you know me.

52:15.233 --> 52:18.467
-No, she doesn't.
-You know that's not what I
would do. That's not who I am.

52:18.469 --> 52:21.403
She doesn't know you
at all. She doesn't know.
I know who you are.

52:21.405 --> 52:24.740
-I'm sorry, can you--
-I know exactly who you are.

52:24.742 --> 52:27.143
-Hold on a second, Shannon.
-[Jason] <i> You're a liar.</i>

52:27.145 --> 52:28.244
[braking car]

52:32.750 --> 52:35.518
I saw your phone.

52:35.520 --> 52:38.354
Okay? I saw the pictures on your
phone. I saw the Lady Library.

52:38.356 --> 52:40.923
I saw Yasmeen
in the Lady Library.

52:40.925 --> 52:43.209
<i>You knew about the bite marks.</i>

52:43.210 --> 52:45.494
<i> You knew about them</i>
<i> the whole time. You</i>
<i> probably put them there.</i>

52:45.496 --> 52:47.196
-He knew about
the bite marks!
-Okay.

52:47.198 --> 52:49.715
-Give me it.
-No.

52:49.716 --> 52:52.233
Give me the-- she needs to know.
She needs to know!

52:52.236 --> 52:53.702
<i> You had sex with my wife.</i>

52:54.906 --> 52:56.505
Uh...

52:58.809 --> 53:00.609
How could you do that?

53:03.548 --> 53:04.647
I loved her.

53:07.385 --> 53:08.851
She didn't love you.

53:08.853 --> 53:14.290
She didn't, Jason.
That's the whole point
I've been trying to tell you.

53:14.292 --> 53:16.258
-No.
-She was terrible for you.

53:18.229 --> 53:21.630
Get out. Get out. Out.

53:21.632 --> 53:24.400
Get out of the car, right now!

53:24.402 --> 53:25.734
-All right.
-Get out!

53:29.807 --> 53:31.207
I'm sorry.

53:33.578 --> 53:34.843
I don't care.

54:09.447 --> 54:10.779
Chickens!

54:19.857 --> 54:21.423
[screaming]

54:42.613 --> 54:43.612
[opening can]

54:55.526 --> 54:58.494
[Vaginia] Oh! Were you bad?

55:00.731 --> 55:01.730
Yeah.

55:28.492 --> 55:31.060

<i> -</i> There're no rules

55:33.331 --> 55:36.432
There's no commitment

55:37.902 --> 55:41.503
There's no pregnancy
in the desert.

55:44.742 --> 55:49.445
What do you say, lost boy? You
want to join me in the desert?

55:49.447 --> 55:52.114
<i> ¶ Then you came</i>

56:18.642 --> 56:19.908
[music ends]

56:19.910 --> 56:21.009
[buzzing sound]

56:41.799 --> 56:44.900
[priest] Yasmeen was
a member of our community.

56:45.870 --> 56:48.804
To her parents,
she was a daughter.

56:48.806 --> 56:51.940
To her siblings,
she was a sibling.

56:51.942 --> 56:54.643
To her doctor,
she was a patient.

56:56.046 --> 56:58.714
To her bartender,
she was a customer.

57:00.017 --> 57:03.051
And to all of us,
she was a friend.

57:03.053 --> 57:05.020
Whom we loved dearly.

57:05.022 --> 57:08.757
But that's not to say that
she lived an easy existence.

57:09.960 --> 57:15.197
No, Yasmeen endured
hardships that many of
us have never had to face

57:15.199 --> 57:16.865
in her short time with us.

57:18.169 --> 57:19.668
Unhealthy relationships,

57:21.071 --> 57:22.504
drug addiction,

57:23.707 --> 57:25.974
chlamydia, gonorrhea,

57:26.944 --> 57:28.143
a pregnancy scare.

57:28.145 --> 57:32.981
It was about two years
ago when Yasmeen last
came to me for guidance.

57:34.084 --> 57:37.853
She hadn't been to church
in quite some years

57:37.855 --> 57:40.055
and wasn't sure if
she'd be welcomed back.

57:40.891 --> 57:44.827
I told her that
with faith, prayer,

57:44.829 --> 57:48.030
repentance and paying
her tithing in full,

57:48.032 --> 57:51.133
she'd be welcomed back
to the church with open arms.

57:54.872 --> 57:56.572
Sir, may I help you? Sir?

58:11.489 --> 58:15.824
Oh no. Oh, no. Where's the ring?

58:15.826 --> 58:18.160
Oh, shit.

58:29.073 --> 58:32.674
No!

58:36.947 --> 58:40.148
-You forget something?
-Mike?

58:43.654 --> 58:44.987
What are you doing here?

58:44.989 --> 58:49.291
I'm bringing you
the ring. You forgot it.

58:50.227 --> 58:54.162
Listen, that whole crazy
dream from Yasmeen?

58:55.866 --> 58:57.266
I get it.

58:57.268 --> 58:58.934
You should do
what it told you to do.

59:00.738 --> 59:02.571
How did you get here?

59:02.573 --> 59:04.139
Zannah. Again.

59:09.847 --> 59:11.213
You should do the thing.

59:26.664 --> 59:27.896
Excuse me.

59:28.799 --> 59:29.965
Who are you?

59:31.135 --> 59:33.835
LeBrawn. I'm her husband.

59:33.837 --> 59:36.138
-What?
-Funeral home forgot
to put this on her.

59:38.242 --> 59:40.576
No, no, no, no, no. Correction.

59:40.578 --> 59:42.945
Her family never wanted
the ring on her finger.

59:42.947 --> 59:44.613
[LeBrawn] She
divorced you, Rando.

59:44.615 --> 59:47.349
It's Ramon Antonio
Sanchez to you!

59:47.351 --> 59:49.651
-Who the hell are you?
-I'm her fiancé.

59:49.653 --> 59:52.154
She's married to me.

59:52.156 --> 59:54.323
You're the one who let her OD.

59:54.325 --> 59:58.827
She wouldn't have turned
to drugs if not for all
you clingy bitches.

59:58.829 --> 01:00:01.196
-You killed her!
-I didn't kill shit.

01:00:08.038 --> 01:00:09.671
Someone get a fire extinguisher!

01:00:09.673 --> 01:00:10.739
I got it.

01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:39.067
¶¶¶

01:00:51.649 --> 01:00:54.683

-Ahh!
-Jason.

01:01:37.828 --> 01:01:39.361
-Hey, Zannah.
-Hey.

01:01:40.464 --> 01:01:41.863
[sobbing] Hey.

01:01:44.435 --> 01:01:46.134
Hey.

01:01:46.136 --> 01:01:48.687
Mike called me.

01:01:48.688 --> 01:01:51.239
He told me what happened,
so I drove him down here.

01:01:52.376 --> 01:01:55.444
That's like a six-hour drive.

01:01:59.783 --> 01:02:01.083
Oh!

01:02:02.252 --> 01:02:04.119
-It's fine.
-Sorry.

01:02:04.121 --> 01:02:05.754
-That's okay. I'm all right.
-Sorry.

01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:08.090
-I'm going to get out.
-It hurt.

01:02:08.092 --> 01:02:10.125
-You okay?
-I'm okay.

01:02:18.035 --> 01:02:19.101
Jason,

01:02:20.404 --> 01:02:24.239
you gave a crap
about Yasmeen. And

01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:31.513
there's not a lot of stuff in
life that's truly crap worthy.

01:02:31.515 --> 01:02:33.348
Yeah.

01:02:33.350 --> 01:02:37.819
And well, I've decided
to move to LA.

01:02:37.821 --> 01:02:41.356
-Oh, I-- you shouldn't
do that on my account.
-To be with my dad.

01:02:44.128 --> 01:02:46.027
Oh, good. Good.

01:02:46.029 --> 01:02:48.096
He has pancreatic cancer.

01:02:49.299 --> 01:02:50.165
Oh.

01:02:51.001 --> 01:02:52.367
-Yeah.
-Hmm.

01:02:52.369 --> 01:02:54.503
-Ah. Yeah.
-Hmm.

01:02:57.274 --> 01:02:59.841
-I know Mike has it,
but here's-- oh!
-Oh!

01:03:02.546 --> 01:03:07.816
That has my phone number, if you
ever need anyone to talk to or

01:03:08.519 --> 01:03:11.253
get emotional support.

01:03:12.322 --> 01:03:14.089
Couch time.

01:03:14.091 --> 01:03:16.124
Practice your music.

01:03:16.126 --> 01:03:17.325
Frozen yogurt.

01:03:22.299 --> 01:03:24.099
I play guitar.

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:25.900
Those all sound
really wonderful, but

01:03:27.437 --> 01:03:29.371
I'm almost forty, I don't...

01:03:29.373 --> 01:03:34.376
Oh, not for, not for
sex or stuff like that.

01:03:34.378 --> 01:03:35.794
Right.

01:03:35.795 --> 01:03:37.211
I thought we were
just flirting, right?

01:03:38.816 --> 01:03:40.081
Wait, we were flirting?

01:03:41.118 --> 01:03:42.517
The tension was palpable.

01:03:44.955 --> 01:03:46.421
Anyways, um,

01:03:48.192 --> 01:03:52.394
I was kind of hoping we could
continue this friendship.

01:03:52.396 --> 01:03:56.198
Maybe get some
coffee or something when
we're both back in LA.

01:03:57.301 --> 01:03:58.834
-Wow.
-Sir.

01:03:58.836 --> 01:04:00.936
Time to go.

01:04:00.937 --> 01:04:03.037
Oh. I'm sorry.
I have to go with this guy.

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:04.472
Okay.

01:04:04.474 --> 01:04:07.108
Call me or
shoot me an email,

01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:09.411
but I didn't write my email
address on that paper.

01:04:09.413 --> 01:04:11.079
-I'll text you.
-Jason.

01:04:11.081 --> 01:04:11.880
Yes?

01:04:11.882 --> 01:04:14.983
You know I'm not twelve, right?

01:04:14.985 --> 01:04:15.917
Right.

01:04:21.925 --> 01:04:23.225
[radio noises]

01:04:23.227 --> 01:04:25.026
I've been to worse funerals.

01:04:25.028 --> 01:04:26.494
[radio chatter]

01:04:32.436 --> 01:04:33.535
[woman] <i> Let them go.</i>

01:04:37.574 --> 01:04:41.376
[Jason] Utah cops are
way more understanding
than I thought they'd be.

01:04:47.451 --> 01:04:48.984
Shannon's pregnant.

01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:51.953
-What?
-Yeah.

01:04:53.590 --> 01:04:54.890
With your...

01:04:56.526 --> 01:04:58.026
Yeah. Yeah.

01:05:02.266 --> 01:05:05.467
-Is that why you...
-Mm-hmm.

01:05:05.469 --> 01:05:10.472
Uh, she told me and I panicked,
and it was a dick move.

01:05:16.146 --> 01:05:17.679
I think you'll be a good dad.

01:05:58.455 --> 01:06:03.058
I think I may have caught
a little bit of scoliosis.

01:06:04.394 --> 01:06:07.195
-Probably all that driving
around in the car, cooped up.
-Yeah.

01:06:07.197 --> 01:06:08.096
Sharing germs.

01:06:09.433 --> 01:06:14.102
You know, I think
I've decided, though.

01:06:17.741 --> 01:06:19.574
I'm going to touch myself again.

01:06:21.278 --> 01:06:23.144
Hey, all right.

01:06:25.615 --> 01:06:26.514
Right now?

01:06:43.433 --> 01:06:46.001
Honestly, though,
do you think I have a
chance of pulling this off?

01:06:48.238 --> 01:06:50.338
Probably a better one
than I did with Yasmeen.

01:06:53.477 --> 01:06:56.144
It's going to be awkward
up front, though.
She's going to be mad.

01:06:56.146 --> 01:06:58.480
Yeah, kind of has
a right to be mad.

01:06:58.482 --> 01:07:04.753
But you know what?
I'm just going to start talking.
I'm going to do it honestly.

01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:07.389
Good.

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:11.092
I'm going to do it.

01:07:11.094 --> 01:07:12.227
-Okay.
-Alright.

01:07:12.229 --> 01:07:13.161
Alright.

01:07:14.698 --> 01:07:19.667
Also, I am sorry I blew
up Yasmeen's corpse.

01:07:19.669 --> 01:07:23.071
I did make sure they
got the finger back.

01:07:23.774 --> 01:07:25.540
Okay. Doing it.

01:07:25.542 --> 01:07:27.242
-Okay.
-I'll see you.

01:07:27.244 --> 01:07:28.810
All right. Good luck!

01:07:29.679 --> 01:07:30.512
[Mike] Thank you.

01:07:30.514 --> 01:07:31.479
[Jason] See you home.

01:07:35.052 --> 01:07:38.219
Probably going to
have make-up sex.

01:07:38.221 --> 01:07:39.087
Easy.
