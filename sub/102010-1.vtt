WEBVTT

00:06.808 --> 00:10.143
Go on, get him out of the van!
Angel! They're here.

00:15.683 --> 00:17.117
Get down Mall cop.

00:17.150 --> 00:20.053
Oh god please don't kill
me, I just started this job 3 days

00:20.087 --> 00:21.288
ago. I'm just a driver!

00:21.321 --> 00:22.624
I didn't ask for your resume.

00:22.657 --> 00:24.659
Why did we take the driver?

00:26.360 --> 00:28.428
You always want to take
more than one hostage, at least

00:28.462 --> 00:32.098
two hostages. It's a good rule
of thumb, just in case you need

00:32.131 --> 00:34.134
to shoot one of them.
I'll show you right now.

00:34.167 --> 00:37.672
Hahaha, you look like
a hulked up Doogie Houser!

00:37.705 --> 00:40.407
You got what you want!
You don't have to shoot anyone!

00:40.440 --> 00:43.511
Is that so? Then this should
be pretty straightforward.

00:43.545 --> 00:44.812
The code to the case!

00:44.846 --> 00:47.749
Wait, you know
what's in the case right?

00:47.782 --> 00:51.485
The code! Or I
ventilate your kneecaps.

00:51.519 --> 00:56.123
You paint quite a
picture. 6-7-7-2.

00:58.125 --> 01:00.562
Far out.

01:14.876 --> 01:19.814
Call M.A.X. Let him
know we found what Lord

01:19.847 --> 01:22.617
Menace requested.

01:22.650 --> 01:27.387
Hahahaha. In a world so
filled with villainy, criminals who

01:27.421 --> 01:30.825
think themselves above the law.
The only thing standing

01:30.858 --> 01:33.895
valiantly in the shadows,
between this city and total

01:33.928 --> 01:34.896
anarchy.

01:34.929 --> 01:36.030
Heroes.

01:36.064 --> 01:39.466
Is justice! We are the justice
Angel Gang, and when the

01:39.499 --> 01:44.404
people cry 'Save us'!
We whisper 'no problem'.

01:45.573 --> 01:47.542
Hahahaha.

01:54.214 --> 01:57.284
Come on! Kill them all!
Kill them all!

02:31.819 --> 02:36.323
It's ok! The name's
Blinx, come with me if you want to live.

02:36.356 --> 02:38.860
There they are, over there!

02:40.394 --> 02:41.929
You ok?

02:41.963 --> 02:43.531
You should be out there.

02:43.564 --> 02:47.401
It's uh,
it's too much gun fire!

02:47.434 --> 02:49.236
That's what I thought.

02:49.269 --> 02:50.505
Now don't start!

02:51.639 --> 02:53.641
Brain!

02:53.675 --> 02:57.578
Brain, we need you!

03:12.392 --> 03:13.761
Oh thank god!

03:16.030 --> 03:18.465
Oh thank you, thank you.

03:18.498 --> 03:21.936
There, there ordinary
citizen, no need to thank me.

03:22.770 --> 03:25.606
Villains know when they've
been out match...

03:31.278 --> 03:33.881
I got this.

03:33.915 --> 03:35.550
Hank wait!

03:43.891 --> 03:45.526
You're just a neutral.

03:45.560 --> 03:49.463
Fear center of the brain is at
maximum, you're not worthy.

03:49.496 --> 03:51.498
But I sense another.

03:56.303 --> 03:59.741
Now that I've finished the warm
up, who's next?

04:04.579 --> 04:07.548
Who might you be?

04:07.582 --> 04:09.483
Looking for me?

04:09.517 --> 04:12.653
Could it be?
A worthy adversary?

04:13.921 --> 04:16.757
Maybe.

04:16.791 --> 04:19.291
But you're gonna
have to catch me first.

04:19.326 --> 04:22.830
Hmmm. Interesting.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.342
Is this what Lord
Menace was expecting?

04:35.375 --> 04:39.346
We have the thorium compound.
You will be handsomely rewarded.

04:39.379 --> 04:41.916
Move your men out.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.651
I don't take no orders
from a god-damned

04:43.684 --> 04:45.620
toaster in a straight-jacket.

04:45.953 --> 04:49.957
Would you like to see what
this toaster is capable of?

04:51.491 --> 04:53.861
This deal's getting
worse all the time.

04:53.895 --> 04:56.296
Come on!

05:19.053 --> 05:20.888
Thank you
for coming in Mr. Martin.

05:20.922 --> 05:24.759
Your resume is,
adequate. We'll let you know.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.794
Well, that's it?

05:27.327 --> 05:29.630
I don't understand the question.

05:29.664 --> 05:31.364
Don't you need more background?

05:31.398 --> 05:32.365
No.

05:32.399 --> 05:33.366
More experience?

05:33.400 --> 05:34.367
No.

05:34.401 --> 05:35.468
Cuz I can go get you-

05:35.503 --> 05:38.005
Off the record, Mr. Martin...

05:38.039 --> 05:40.141
this is not the type
of resume that's going to land

05:40.174 --> 05:42.543
you a position with our company.

05:42.577 --> 05:44.912
You haven't worked in 8 months.

05:45.378 --> 05:47.782
It's not my fault,
the economy is rough.

05:49.183 --> 05:52.352
Not for us.
We'll let you know.

06:53.581 --> 06:54.782
Hey Carl.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.416
Hey Joe, how are ya?

06:56.817 --> 06:59.720
Muriel won't let me smoke in
the house anymore.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.624
See ya Carl.

07:03.658 --> 07:04.692
Have a good one.

07:14.802 --> 07:15.903
Loser.

07:15.937 --> 07:17.004
Slug.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.106
Sarah!

07:19.140 --> 07:21.242
Don't distract her, she's
making my sandwich.

07:21.275 --> 07:24.578
"Don't distract her,
she's making my sandwich"

07:24.612 --> 07:25.947
Weirdo.

07:27.248 --> 07:28.683
Head Shot!

07:28.716 --> 07:29.817
Oh!

07:29.850 --> 07:32.053
Oh my god!
I'm sorry baby, I didn't see you.

07:32.086 --> 07:34.055
It's ok, it's ok it's ok!
Is it ok?

07:34.088 --> 07:37.758
I think so here, we don't
need you bleeding at interviews.

07:38.859 --> 07:39.894
Let me see.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.562
It couldn't be any rougher
than it was this morning.

07:41.595 --> 07:42.663
It didn't go well?

07:42.697 --> 07:44.231
No, it was horrible.

07:44.265 --> 07:46.934
I feel like I'm Saran-Wrap
and they're just looking

07:46.968 --> 07:49.003
right through me
on to the next guy.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.104
Let me see,

07:50.137 --> 07:52.139
Alright I think you're ok.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.042
My hero.

07:55.076 --> 07:56.077
I know.

07:56.110 --> 07:58.579
You'll catch a break
on the next one, alright?

07:58.612 --> 08:00.781
No, that's it for today.
No more-

08:00.815 --> 08:03.617
Actually, I got you
another interview.

08:03.651 --> 08:06.554
Muriel's son said that there's a
job opening where he works.

08:06.587 --> 08:10.191
It's decent hours,
not great pay.

08:10.224 --> 08:12.760
Where?

08:12.793 --> 08:15.896
Just right around the corner.

08:15.930 --> 08:16.931
Doing?

08:16.964 --> 08:17.965
Hm?

08:17.999 --> 08:19.533
Doing?

08:19.567 --> 08:21.135
Management.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.136
Of?

08:22.169 --> 08:23.604
Tell him.

08:23.637 --> 08:24.772
Waste.

08:24.805 --> 08:25.573
Garbage?!

08:25.606 --> 08:27.008
Joe, I know
that it's not ideal...

08:27.041 --> 08:28.542
Baby, I got interviews!

08:28.576 --> 08:30.544
Interviews don't pay mortgages.

08:30.578 --> 08:31.645
I know.
I'm supposed to be the

08:31.679 --> 08:34.081
man of the house and I can't
even buy a carton of eggs.

08:34.115 --> 08:35.249
Joe has no huevos.

08:35.282 --> 08:37.217
Look baby, I just don't think
right now's the time for me

08:37.251 --> 08:38.885
to look at being a garbageman.

08:38.919 --> 08:41.288
Waste management.

08:41.322 --> 08:43.289
I deal with enough
garbage all day long.

08:43.323 --> 08:44.692
Is my sandwich ready?

08:44.725 --> 08:46.727
Speaking of wasted garbage.

08:46.761 --> 08:48.195
Now's not the
time for pride Joe.

08:48.229 --> 08:50.131
Yeah Joe, when you going to
stop leeching off my sister?

08:50.164 --> 08:51.298
I don't leach off your sister!

08:51.332 --> 08:52.466
Yes you do!

08:52.500 --> 08:55.102
At least he tries, which is more
than I can say for you.

08:55.136 --> 08:56.771
Did you know he spent
the last two days

08:56.804 --> 09:00.141
watching Judge Judy marathons?

09:00.174 --> 09:01.308
Baby I was exhausted!

09:01.342 --> 09:02.576
- Seriously?!
- I got stress!

09:02.610 --> 09:03.911
I've got stress!

09:03.944 --> 09:04.812
Over what?!

09:04.845 --> 09:06.580
Hearing you have sex
in the next room!

09:06.614 --> 09:07.581
What?!

09:07.615 --> 09:08.649
Yeah, you have thin walls!

09:08.682 --> 09:10.251
And seriously, what is
up with the monkey noises?

09:10.284 --> 09:11.986
- You can hear that?!
- Yes, I can hear that!

09:12.019 --> 09:13.220
How thin are our walls?

09:13.254 --> 09:14.755
Baby!

09:16.157 --> 09:18.325
I hope you freaking
choke on that sandwich.

09:18.993 --> 09:20.661
Baby!

09:23.697 --> 09:26.333
Uh-oh! Sad Sarah!

09:26.367 --> 09:27.201
Joe, no. no.

09:27.234 --> 09:30.337
Need monkey?
Sad Sarah need sexy monkey?!

09:30.371 --> 09:31.939
Stop seriously.

09:31.972 --> 09:32.940
What? What?

09:32.973 --> 09:33.941
This is serious!

09:33.974 --> 09:35.009
I know it's serious.

09:35.042 --> 09:36.243
Why are you so serious?

09:36.277 --> 09:38.179
We're not kids anymore!

09:38.212 --> 09:39.880
I know we're not kids.

09:39.914 --> 09:42.083
But I took care of us then,
and I'll take care of us now.

09:42.116 --> 09:44.885
I know babe, but I'm the one
with all the responsibility now.

09:44.919 --> 09:48.889
Ok? And I know it's not easy,
but we have to do this together.

09:48.923 --> 09:51.225
Ok, I can't do this by myself.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.661
We're a whole.

09:56.197 --> 09:57.164
Really?

09:57.198 --> 09:58.632
'Cause I said whole?

09:58.666 --> 10:00.234
Well, you're
the one who said it.

10:00.267 --> 10:03.137
Oh, my god!
What is wrong with you?!

10:03.170 --> 10:06.907
Look, I want to feel
like a man again, I do.

10:08.909 --> 10:10.711
I mean, I remember
the stories you used to tell me

10:10.744 --> 10:14.849
about when your dad left, and
how you took care of everyone.

10:14.882 --> 10:17.184
And I want to do that for you.

10:17.218 --> 10:19.954
I want to do that for us.

10:19.987 --> 10:23.257
And you're right, you've carried
this burden way too long.

10:24.058 --> 10:27.061
Ok, you need to just go into
those interviews,

10:27.094 --> 10:30.097
and show them how amazing
and confident you are, and lie.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.266
Lie?

10:32.299 --> 10:33.267
Not lie, not lie.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.703
Just show them how
important and good you are

10:35.736 --> 10:38.305
because you deserve it.

10:38.339 --> 10:41.642
Yeah, I can do that.

10:42.710 --> 10:44.979
Couldn't do any worse could it?

10:45.479 --> 10:47.381
My Hero.

10:47.414 --> 10:48.949
I know.

10:50.184 --> 10:52.753
You feel like a man to me.

10:52.786 --> 10:53.787
Do I?

10:53.988 --> 10:55.289
- Do I?
- Yes.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.423
- Do I?
- Yes.

10:56.457 --> 10:57.024
Yeah, do it again.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.359
- Yes.
- Do it more.

10:58.392 --> 11:00.327
Do it till milk comes out.

11:00.361 --> 11:02.830
Are you thirsty?
There you go, just drink it.

11:07.201 --> 11:09.436
Are you sure there's nothing
else in the paper from today?

11:09.470 --> 11:11.438
Yes. No baby, I...

11:11.472 --> 11:12.873
You looked at all the jobs?

11:12.907 --> 11:14.241
I'm looking at it right now.

11:14.275 --> 11:15.876
Well don't feel like you
have to hold back.

11:15.910 --> 11:18.913
It's ok to exaggerate
a bit on your qualifications.

11:18.946 --> 11:20.047
Get your foot in the door.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.048
Yes, yes, yes.

11:21.081 --> 11:22.116
Are you even listening Joe?

11:22.149 --> 11:24.051
You know what, let me
give you a call right back.

11:24.084 --> 11:25.486
Ok, let me know
how it goes. Love you!

11:25.520 --> 11:27.021
Ok, you too.

11:37.498 --> 11:39.767
Are you here
for the interview?

11:39.800 --> 11:42.102
Oh, no. No.

11:45.439 --> 11:48.442
Fourteenth floor.
Welcome to Heroics Incorporated.

11:49.176 --> 11:50.811
Mind your step.

11:55.316 --> 11:58.452
Heroics Inc. Yes sir,
we still have one position available.

11:58.852 --> 12:01.255
Tomorrow
between 1 and 2?

12:01.288 --> 12:03.824
Great, thank you.
We'll see you then.

12:03.857 --> 12:05.025
Yes, how can I help you?

12:05.359 --> 12:08.329
Hi, I'm Joe Martin, I called
about the ad in the paper?

12:08.362 --> 12:09.863
The 3 o'clock appointment.

12:09.897 --> 12:10.431
Yes!

12:10.831 --> 12:13.167
I like your look.
It's different.

12:13.702 --> 12:15.503
Very average citizen.

12:16.070 --> 12:16.870
Thanks.

12:17.639 --> 12:21.075
Mr. Simons to conference
room A. Mr. Simons to conference room A.

12:24.011 --> 12:26.146
Hey man, should I have come
in a costume or something?

12:27.348 --> 12:29.416
Oh, no man,
it's for the kiddos.

12:30.851 --> 12:33.954
For the kiddos!
Now it makes sense.

12:33.988 --> 12:36.223
So you guys do this stuff for
like, birthday parties and

12:36.257 --> 12:38.392
Bar Mitzvahs and conventions

12:38.425 --> 12:40.294
for like comic books and stuff?

12:40.327 --> 12:42.229
Yeah. This job is a joke.

12:45.165 --> 12:48.068
Really?

12:48.102 --> 12:49.470
Yeah, there's no
crime left in the city.

12:49.504 --> 12:51.539
All that's left is...

12:51.573 --> 12:54.108
a bunch of yahoos and geeks
running around in spandex

12:54.141 --> 12:55.510
trying to out-virgin
each other.

12:56.544 --> 12:58.979
I mean, you at least look like
you might be normal.

12:59.013 --> 13:01.583
Like you took your action
figures out of the package

13:01.616 --> 13:03.250
and played with them
a little bit.

13:03.585 --> 13:05.486
Maybe touched a boob.

13:05.986 --> 13:07.555
Look at this guy.

13:07.788 --> 13:10.991
Hey buddy what are you supposed
to be? A smurf at the prom?

13:11.559 --> 13:13.595
Oh, come on Wallace. Don't act
like you don't know me man,

13:13.628 --> 13:16.163
you think that costume fools me?
We went to elementary school

13:16.196 --> 13:18.832
together, you used to cry every
day on the playground.

13:18.866 --> 13:20.568
I don't think I would call you
for an emergency unless

13:20.602 --> 13:24.104
you could use your super-sissy
tears to put out a fire.

13:24.138 --> 13:26.473
Yeah go home! Go ahead man.

13:26.508 --> 13:28.576
Go home and cry to Mom,
Betsy-Wetsy, I'll be over to

13:28.610 --> 13:32.012
beat you up and take your
lunch money. Haha-Haha!

13:33.981 --> 13:36.950
Well, I mean,
I guess its a paycheck.

13:36.984 --> 13:39.386
My wife says
I should exaggerate.

13:39.820 --> 13:43.290
Oh, hell man. Exaggerate,
put it all out there dude,

13:43.324 --> 13:44.325
they'll eat it up. Oh yeah.

13:44.358 --> 13:46.927
Mr. Garrett
to conference room A.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.296
Mr. Garrett
to conference room A.

13:49.664 --> 13:51.432
That's me.

13:53.635 --> 13:55.035
Here, you want to finish those?

13:55.069 --> 13:56.904
Alright, well hey,
good luck man.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.005
You too!

14:01.275 --> 14:02.577
My name is Dat-Man.

14:02.610 --> 14:04.612
I am the defender of
old technology.

14:04.646 --> 14:06.914
Next!

14:06.947 --> 14:08.282
Do you have a 401-K?

14:08.315 --> 14:09.751
Next!

14:09.784 --> 14:14.522
I'm the Mag-Pie, and basically,
I'm like Aquaman, but for birds.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.592
Do you guys want
to hear my bird calls?

14:19.661 --> 14:20.628
Next.

14:20.662 --> 14:22.896
I'm a Super. You need a Super.

14:22.930 --> 14:23.997
Next!

14:24.031 --> 14:25.399
I do own a massive
collection of goats.

14:25.432 --> 14:27.502
I am the Mighty
Placeholder! The hero's hero.

14:27.535 --> 14:28.503
Next.

14:28.536 --> 14:30.638
I'm Captain
Kill Devil. Ahoy.

14:30.672 --> 14:32.139
I am Captain Crow's-Feet.

14:32.172 --> 14:33.207
Next!

14:40.013 --> 14:42.249
I'm sorry, you are The Nudist?

14:43.183 --> 14:45.486
Yeah, or I mean Glen.

14:45.520 --> 14:47.254
But The Nudist is fine.

14:48.088 --> 14:50.357
I just don't see how that's
a super power.

14:55.062 --> 14:56.430
Oh wow! OK.

14:57.965 --> 14:59.233
Very impressive.

14:59.266 --> 15:00.602
Not bad yourself.

15:00.635 --> 15:01.603
You can go now.

15:01.636 --> 15:02.604
Huh?

15:02.637 --> 15:03.605
Go Now.

15:03.638 --> 15:05.272
- Did I get it?
- Go Now!

15:05.305 --> 15:07.174
Mr. Martin to conference room A.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.343
Mr. Martin, conference room A.

15:23.490 --> 15:26.661
Your motivation is to
stay married.

15:29.664 --> 15:30.698
What was your name again?

15:30.732 --> 15:31.932
Joe.

15:32.700 --> 15:34.702
Just average Joe?

15:34.736 --> 15:36.303
Mm-hmm. Yep.

15:37.371 --> 15:38.372
I like it.

15:41.509 --> 15:43.377
Could you tell us a
little bit about yourself Joe?

15:43.410 --> 15:47.381
Sure! I actually
have a passion against evil,

15:47.414 --> 15:49.283
I actually just got back
from the east coast

15:49.316 --> 15:52.554
where I was battling
my arch-nemesis The Crusher.

15:52.587 --> 15:54.722
He threw me into a
building in Manhattan

15:54.756 --> 15:56.490
and it crumbled
all around me.

15:56.524 --> 15:58.292
I was able to fight my way
out and destroy

15:58.325 --> 16:00.695
the two nuclear warheads
that were going to destroy

16:00.728 --> 16:02.029
life as we know it.

16:02.062 --> 16:03.665
Or as they know it.

16:04.465 --> 16:05.733
Where's your costume?

16:06.066 --> 16:09.102
Oh you see, that's my trick.
I like to blend in.

16:09.136 --> 16:11.539
That way the villains,
they don't see me coming

16:11.573 --> 16:12.707
and then BAM!

16:12.740 --> 16:15.175
I zap them with
my eye lasers.

16:15.409 --> 16:16.711
Could we get a demonstration?

16:16.744 --> 16:18.312
Do you have a death wish?

16:20.380 --> 16:21.348
How strong are you?

16:21.381 --> 16:24.619
Oh, strong enough to lift
about 3 school buses

16:24.652 --> 16:26.019
over my head at the same time.

16:26.053 --> 16:27.488
As strong as Hercules?

16:27.522 --> 16:31.091
I'd eat Hercules for breakfast.

16:31.124 --> 16:32.392
Come on bro!

16:33.528 --> 16:35.597
Wow, A+ for showmanship.

16:37.799 --> 16:39.366
Could you tell me your
powers again?

16:39.399 --> 16:40.668
Sure!

16:40.702 --> 16:44.171
I can fly, of course,
I can shoot laser beams out of my eyes.

16:44.204 --> 16:45.740
Oh yeah!
I'm bulletproof.

16:46.340 --> 16:49.076
So we might as well just call
you the ultimate crimefighter?

16:49.611 --> 16:51.746
Why wouldn't you?

16:51.779 --> 16:53.781
- Why wouldn't we?
- I don't know!

16:56.283 --> 16:57.785
Quite honestly, Joe, you're
the best candidate

16:57.819 --> 16:59.052
we've seen all day.

16:59.086 --> 17:00.822
Yeah, all day we've had...

17:00.855 --> 17:03.257
"my dad sent me here
on a rocket ship" OR

17:03.290 --> 17:06.292
"I got bit by a
radioactive whatever"

17:06.560 --> 17:09.597
But this is bold, audacious.

17:10.598 --> 17:13.500
Would you give me and my
colleague a moment to confer?

17:13.902 --> 17:15.770
Sure, chat away.

17:20.508 --> 17:22.175
Hey, how'd you do that?

17:25.279 --> 17:26.513
Congratulations!

17:26.548 --> 17:27.582
Really?!

17:27.615 --> 17:29.349
Yep!
Welcome aboard!

17:30.050 --> 17:32.754
No way! My wife is
gonna be so excited!

17:32.787 --> 17:33.755
You don't even know!

17:34.488 --> 17:37.324
Let's get you over to H.R. and
get everything squared away.

17:37.357 --> 17:38.325
Ok.

17:38.358 --> 17:39.794
Did you say you were married?

17:39.827 --> 17:41.194
Yeah.

17:41.963 --> 17:43.798
You don't hear about
that much in this field.

17:43.831 --> 17:45.700
Except for the Parkers.

17:48.603 --> 17:50.505
Well, all that's left
is to get you to H.R.,

17:50.538 --> 17:54.074
get you fitted and get you out
on those streets fighting crime.

17:54.676 --> 17:56.544
Thanks.
So was it an optical illusion?

17:57.579 --> 17:59.379
The way you moved so fast?

17:59.413 --> 18:00.848
Oh, that's my super power.

18:01.516 --> 18:05.352
Oh.

18:05.385 --> 18:07.487
Wait! Did you say
fighting crime?

18:08.455 --> 18:09.489
Lift activated.

18:09.524 --> 18:11.859
Transferring to
main headquarters.

18:11.893 --> 18:13.360
Please watch your
hands.

18:14.461 --> 18:15.195
Hello?

18:15.228 --> 18:16.496
Phase 3 commencing.

18:16.531 --> 18:18.533
Observe all safety
procedures.

18:19.067 --> 18:20.233
Transporter separation.

18:20.267 --> 18:21.502
I'm kinda in the dark here!

18:21.536 --> 18:23.738
Low lights on.

18:23.771 --> 18:25.372
Hello?

18:25.405 --> 18:27.207
Hey, I'm looking for H.R.?

18:27.942 --> 18:31.512
I am H.R.!
Heinrich Rammelstein.

18:31.946 --> 18:33.615
But you can call me...

18:35.683 --> 18:37.284
Dr. Mystico!

18:39.252 --> 18:41.823
I apologize for the
state of my lab!

18:42.356 --> 18:43.524
Let's get you changed.

18:43.558 --> 18:45.526
Wait, so what's phase 3?

18:45.560 --> 18:50.364
Blue, Average Joe,
blue collar. Makes sense yes?

18:50.397 --> 18:52.900
We're going to go with
a very basic look this time.

18:52.934 --> 18:54.301
There you go.

18:56.904 --> 18:58.438
This will do.

19:00.608 --> 19:03.544
So, do kids get to
see all this back here?

19:03.578 --> 19:04.579
Kids?!

19:04.979 --> 19:07.180
No, this is no
place for children!

19:07.749 --> 19:08.816
Are you mad?

19:08.850 --> 19:11.485
They could touch this and
particles and molecules

19:11.519 --> 19:12.319
would get mixed up.

19:12.352 --> 19:13.821
And this!
This hasn't been washed!

19:14.522 --> 19:16.691
The children could come,
and they could flip this

19:16.724 --> 19:18.492
and all hell would break loo ...!

19:19.927 --> 19:20.995
...would break loose.

19:21.029 --> 19:23.698
I thought I was filling
out paperwork, not briefs!

19:23.731 --> 19:25.499
Oh, you're a funny one!

19:25.533 --> 19:28.836
Now that you've got your suit
let's move on with the mission.

19:28.870 --> 19:30.203
Mission?!

19:30.237 --> 19:31.939
Now, exactly what do
you mean by mission?

19:31.973 --> 19:33.240
Crime fighting!

19:33.273 --> 19:34.542
Welcome to the party pal.

19:34.942 --> 19:36.544
Oh boy.

19:37.745 --> 19:39.580
Alright there's been
a chemical plant break-in

19:39.614 --> 19:42.416
that just turned into
a hostage situation!

19:42.449 --> 19:43.818
Hostages?!
Wait a minute.

19:43.851 --> 19:45.352
There must be some mistake.

19:45.385 --> 19:46.521
See you there Doc!

19:46.554 --> 19:48.488
Are you guys
real super heroes?!

19:48.523 --> 19:49.657
I'm a pacifist.

19:49.691 --> 19:50.658
What?!

19:50.692 --> 19:51.993
I'm a science officer.

19:52.026 --> 19:53.961
I don't believe in violence.

19:53.995 --> 19:55.663
It's icky.

19:55.697 --> 19:57.699
Hold that thought!

20:01.869 --> 20:03.971
All units in the
vicinity of Cash and Lincoln

20:04.005 --> 20:07.340
10-89 in progress at
1988 Cash Avenue.

20:07.875 --> 20:10.645
Be advised. Several armed
gunmen have taken hostages.

20:10.978 --> 20:13.380
Suspects are considered
armed and extremely dangerous.

20:13.915 --> 20:15.583
All units in the area respond.

20:21.689 --> 20:22.824
Captain, they're here!

20:22.857 --> 20:24.625
About time!

20:25.893 --> 20:26.861
Hallenbeck!

20:26.894 --> 20:28.596
I made the call, but
the captain is in charge.

20:28.629 --> 20:29.864
Riggs, go
get 5 more coffees!

20:29.897 --> 20:31.799
I'm not your secretary!

20:34.802 --> 20:37.437
Hallenbeck! I'm waiting
on SWAT and you bring me

20:37.471 --> 20:39.006
The Mighty Morphin
Powder Puff Rangers?!

20:39.040 --> 20:41.374
Aw, someone's still bitter
cuz he didn't make the cut for hero.

20:41.408 --> 20:42.210
Larry!

20:42.242 --> 20:43.644
Not my fault
he has brittle bones!

20:43.678 --> 20:44.879
I hate you Larry.

20:44.912 --> 20:46.614
And who the hell are you?

20:46.647 --> 20:47.815
My name is Average Joe.

20:47.849 --> 20:49.416
He's new Captain, but he checked
out. He's bulletproof and

20:49.449 --> 20:50.885
he's got lasers that
shoot out of his eyes.

20:50.918 --> 20:53.487
Well then what the hell are you
letting him stare at me for?!

20:53.521 --> 20:55.656
I'm sorry! Jesus they're
shooting at us!

20:57.792 --> 21:00.661
There's a bunch of maniacs in
there with some hostages.

21:00.695 --> 21:03.463
They've got the place rigged to
blow with a shitload of C-4.

21:03.497 --> 21:05.332
Sounds like an A-6 scenario.

21:05.365 --> 21:07.668
We're going to need someone
bulletproof to lead the charge.

21:10.571 --> 21:12.372
No one knows
what you're saying!

21:12.405 --> 21:14.441
Joe, you're the
only one qualified!

21:14.474 --> 21:15.710
No, I'm not even
supposed to be here!

21:15.743 --> 21:16.811
I'm not supposed
to be doing this!

21:16.844 --> 21:19.412
Listen, fly in there,
disable it,

21:19.446 --> 21:20.882
hell, blow it up
for all I care!

21:20.915 --> 21:24.351
Just get it the hell out
of here so we can all go home!

21:24.384 --> 21:26.053
Do what you were born to do.

21:26.087 --> 21:27.420
Be a hero!

21:36.864 --> 21:38.933
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

21:40.367 --> 21:40.835
Ok.

21:42.603 --> 21:44.539
Alright.

21:56.918 --> 21:59.620
Aw... alright

21:59.654 --> 22:01.421
WHY?!

22:02.690 --> 22:04.525
Shit, shit shit!

22:04.559 --> 22:05.760
Aaahhh!!!

22:07.695 --> 22:08.495
That was weird.

22:08.529 --> 22:10.965
I'm getting massive
power readings.

22:10.998 --> 22:11.966
Who is this?

22:11.999 --> 22:13.000
Angel gang.

22:13.034 --> 22:14.035
Not his style.

22:15.435 --> 22:16.838
Unless he's working
for someone else.

22:16.871 --> 22:18.072
Let's move!

22:19.974 --> 22:21.642
Someone wake up Larry!

22:36.824 --> 22:37.925
Let's go!

22:41.195 --> 22:43.931
Mary.
Mary. Come in Mary.

22:43.965 --> 22:45.365
Mary answer your thing.

22:46.499 --> 22:48.736
Mary it's Dr. Mystico, answer.

22:48.769 --> 22:49.637
Doc what is it?

22:49.670 --> 22:51.939
We found a machine down here.

22:51.973 --> 22:52.940
On screen.

22:52.974 --> 22:54.609
It doesn't look good.

22:54.642 --> 22:56.443
Doc we don't have time
for this just find the bomb.

22:56.644 --> 22:58.713
You find the bomb!

23:00.514 --> 23:02.516
Oh God, please don't let me die.

23:06.988 --> 23:09.924
Everything's going
to be alright, just wait.

23:10.457 --> 23:12.560
Do what you were born to do.

23:12.994 --> 23:14.562
I was born to run like hell.

23:16.931 --> 23:18.599
How do you even
disarm this thing?

23:21.035 --> 23:22.136
Is it the red one?

23:23.170 --> 23:24.505
Is it the green one?!

23:26.540 --> 23:27.875
You're not helping me!

23:29.043 --> 23:30.778
In the movies it's
always the green one.

23:31.612 --> 23:33.681
I'm sure it's
always the green one.

23:33.714 --> 23:35.016
What are you doing?!

23:35.316 --> 23:36.717
Are you touching the bomb?

23:36.751 --> 23:38.185
Are you even qualified
to touch the bomb?!

23:38.219 --> 23:39.754
Are you even a real hero?

23:40.955 --> 23:41.923
You lied?!

23:41.956 --> 23:42.924
You mean you hired a-

23:42.957 --> 23:43.925
Shut it Hank!

23:43.958 --> 23:45.660
I'm Nightwatchman.

23:45.693 --> 23:48.062
Unbelievable!

23:48.095 --> 23:49.196
Guys, if I could just
say something-

23:49.230 --> 23:51.565
You think you could have
done a better job? Guys!

23:51.599 --> 23:52.566
Oh, I think I could.

23:52.600 --> 23:53.466
I think it's fairly obvious!

23:53.500 --> 23:55.603
Oh, so you're saying
I made a mistake?!

23:55.636 --> 23:56.904
It's VERY obvious.

23:56.938 --> 23:59.206
I don't make mistakes!

23:59.240 --> 24:00.608
Guys, just one second!

24:00.641 --> 24:01.609
WHAT?!

24:01.642 --> 24:03.744
This things
about to go off!

24:03.778 --> 24:05.246
Balls!

24:34.642 --> 24:36.177
What happened?

24:38.279 --> 24:40.948
I agree with you Mrs.
Mayor. This is unacceptable!

24:42.750 --> 24:46.087
But have faith, you
made the right decision.

24:46.520 --> 24:47.487
Did I?

24:47.521 --> 24:50.224
Your heroes cleaned up
the city 10 years ago.

24:50.257 --> 24:52.760
They did it quietly,
no theatrics.

24:52.793 --> 24:54.628
No spectacle.

24:54.662 --> 24:57.131
I won't tolerate
any mistakes Mary.

24:57.164 --> 25:01.702
I can send you back to that
crummy PR firm you came from.

25:01.736 --> 25:04.705
Oh, and rethink the uniforms.

25:05.740 --> 25:07.975
You look like Zoro's fat cousin.

25:12.980 --> 25:14.548
Should we kill him?

25:14.582 --> 25:15.549
We took an oath.

25:15.583 --> 25:17.051
I ain't gonna say anything.

25:19.353 --> 25:22.156
Mary, I recognized
that device today.

25:22.823 --> 25:25.159
If Angel is working
with who I think.

25:26.293 --> 25:27.862
We're all in great danger.

25:33.034 --> 25:34.902
So what do I do now?

25:34.935 --> 25:38.005
So you go back to your wife,

25:38.606 --> 25:41.242
tell her you got the job,

25:41.275 --> 25:43.544
we'll see you in the morning.

25:57.892 --> 26:00.061
That's right
Maria, it was a massive explosion

26:00.094 --> 26:01.095
that rocked the lower
east side...

26:01.128 --> 26:03.097
Hey Babe!

26:03.130 --> 26:04.632
Hey.

26:04.665 --> 26:06.100
You've been
gone all day.

26:07.068 --> 26:09.804
Yeah, the uh....

26:09.837 --> 26:11.172
...the interview went long.

26:12.239 --> 26:13.641
Is that good or bad?

26:15.709 --> 26:17.311
Bad.

26:19.146 --> 26:21.182
Bad enough to get the job.

26:22.083 --> 26:22.817
What?!

26:22.850 --> 26:24.685
Baby, I got the job!

26:24.718 --> 26:25.686
You got the job?!

26:25.719 --> 26:26.687
Baby I did!

26:26.720 --> 26:28.622
You joking?
You're serious?

26:28.656 --> 26:30.057
I love you!

26:30.091 --> 26:31.192
I love you,
take your clothes off!

26:31.225 --> 26:32.226
Ok!

26:38.032 --> 26:41.368
It's just us.
Just, stay there.

26:43.003 --> 26:44.905
Hey boss. How'd the test go?

26:44.939 --> 26:45.940
Cops came.

26:45.973 --> 26:48.342
We had to set off the bomb
and ditch the device.

26:49.009 --> 26:50.845
That sucks.

26:55.349 --> 26:57.418
Ok, listen here Iron-Dick.

26:57.451 --> 26:59.186
We're risking our
lives out there.

26:59.220 --> 27:00.688
We're putting our necks out
there every night

27:00.721 --> 27:02.957
and you're going to pay me
three times my price

27:02.990 --> 27:05.059
or I'm going to tear
your little ass apart.

27:05.092 --> 27:07.094
Manners Angel.

27:07.128 --> 27:09.997
M.A.X. is an indispensable
part of my plan,

27:10.030 --> 27:14.135
whereas you have a rather
expendable quality about you.

27:17.471 --> 27:19.707
Lord Menace, we're taking

27:19.740 --> 27:21.976
all the risks and getting
almost none of the reward.

27:22.009 --> 27:24.745
By all means, leave.

27:24.778 --> 27:26.347
I'm sure there are plenty of
other vultures in this

27:26.380 --> 27:29.316
city who would be happy to take
your place by my side.

27:29.350 --> 27:33.120
However, if we fail to
execute my plans

27:33.154 --> 27:36.957
these heroes won't leave you
with much of a feast.

27:36.991 --> 27:41.095
You see, your business model is
based on profit, greed.

27:41.128 --> 27:43.230
I pay you well.

27:43.264 --> 27:48.202
My plans are result based,
and you haven't delivered.

27:48.802 --> 27:51.238
My device could have been
tested properly today

27:51.272 --> 27:53.974
had you not called
attention to yourselves.

27:54.008 --> 27:59.079
Maybe, you're just feeling
a little BURNED OUT.

27:59.113 --> 28:00.781
Whoa, whoa, ok.

28:00.814 --> 28:02.449
Hey look, just put that
away, just...

28:02.483 --> 28:04.018
there's no need for this ok?!

28:04.051 --> 28:05.452
I'm going to be...

28:05.486 --> 28:06.787
No, don't shoot me!!

28:06.820 --> 28:07.855
Aaahhhh!!

28:08.489 --> 28:10.157
Ok, I'm out.

28:13.327 --> 28:15.262
When the machine
is capable of withstanding

28:15.296 --> 28:17.431
the power surge,
M.A.X and I will

28:17.464 --> 28:21.769
make our final move on
Heinrich and the heroes.

28:22.736 --> 28:27.875
Soon not even time itself
will be able to stop me.

29:06.413 --> 29:09.083
I'm going to do whatever it
takes to make this work.

29:20.027 --> 29:21.862
Morning tushy.

29:21.895 --> 29:23.430
Good Morning.

29:23.464 --> 29:24.599
Did you make me cookies?

29:24.633 --> 29:27.768
No, I did,
because someone kept me up last night.

29:28.603 --> 29:31.105
Yeah, that's cuz
I was having sex!

29:31.872 --> 29:34.542
I was thinking, I have
teacher in service day today,

29:34.576 --> 29:36.410
so maybe I could stay home

29:36.443 --> 29:38.045
for a little while before
you start your job.

29:38.078 --> 29:39.413
That would be amazing.

29:39.446 --> 29:41.549
Hey, I meant to ask you,
what's the job anyway?

29:41.583 --> 29:43.984
Oh...

29:44.018 --> 29:46.820
It's nothing really.
I just uh...

29:46.854 --> 29:48.155
...working in a lab and...

29:48.188 --> 29:49.557
Somebody's here.

29:49.591 --> 29:50.791
Who?

29:50.824 --> 29:53.294
A lady that looks like she's
pinching a dime between her ass

29:53.327 --> 29:56.096
and a hunky scientist.

29:56.130 --> 29:58.332
I'm so sorry! I'm sorry
baby, that's for me.

29:58.365 --> 29:59.466
That's for me!

29:59.500 --> 30:02.136
I gotta go, I forgot they
pick you up the first day.

30:02.169 --> 30:04.071
I gotta go. Love you!

30:04.104 --> 30:07.174
Love you. Good luck!

30:07.207 --> 30:09.276
I'll take that, you
choke on that!

30:10.210 --> 30:11.412
What the heck!

30:11.445 --> 30:14.114
What are you guys even doing
here? This is my freaking house.

30:14.148 --> 30:15.849
This is my house, what are
you doing here?

30:15.883 --> 30:16.984
This is my temple of zen!

30:17.017 --> 30:18.085
We carpool.

30:18.118 --> 30:19.486
Oh, I guess you failed to
mention that yesterday.

30:19.521 --> 30:21.523
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I
fail to mention that?

30:21.556 --> 30:25.426
I must have been distracted by a
massive explosion you caused!

30:25.459 --> 30:29.930
That's a good point.
That's a good point.

30:29.963 --> 30:31.999
So, it's usually just us.

30:32.032 --> 30:33.934
Larry's the only one
that can fly.

30:33.967 --> 30:36.070
Well I did offer to
rectify such things.

30:36.504 --> 30:37.539
And I'm still hungry.

30:37.838 --> 30:39.106
Here, go nuts.

30:42.343 --> 30:43.477
Who's that?

30:44.011 --> 30:46.980
Oh, that's my sister-in-law,
she's a handful.

30:48.248 --> 30:49.450
I'll bet she is.

30:52.286 --> 30:53.621
Hunky man's eating my cookie.

30:55.022 --> 30:56.256
Who does she think she is?

30:56.290 --> 30:58.158
Opening the door
for my husband.

30:58.192 --> 30:59.259
Jealous?

30:59.794 --> 31:01.862
I just don't like
fast women that's all.

31:06.534 --> 31:08.268
Since you're clueless
about being a super hero,

31:08.302 --> 31:09.403
here's the brief.

31:09.436 --> 31:11.972
Heroics Inc has wiped out
crime over the last decade

31:12.005 --> 31:14.375
and we only recently got
reactivated.

31:14.408 --> 31:18.312
In the past 6 months,
crime has gone up over 62%.

31:19.113 --> 31:20.981
If we go public, the mayor
thinks we won't have

31:21.014 --> 31:22.349
the support we need.

31:22.383 --> 31:24.885
It's my job to keep us
on track and covert.

31:26.954 --> 31:30.090
Hey, so why'd you put the
ad in the newspaper then?

31:30.124 --> 31:32.960
It was for heroes to read.

31:33.227 --> 31:35.262
Is that why you put it in
the super secret

31:35.295 --> 31:36.463
super hero newspaper?

31:36.497 --> 31:39.667
I thought hiding in
plain sight was best.

31:39.701 --> 31:42.570
Besides, who took
that ad seriously?

31:42.604 --> 31:44.672
Yeah, the uh-

31:44.706 --> 31:46.608
Most people thought it was for
kids parties and they were easy

31:46.641 --> 31:49.042
enough to dismiss.

31:49.878 --> 31:52.946
So, you're just saying
you just made a mistake?

31:57.619 --> 31:59.554
Oh, would you look at that.

31:59.587 --> 32:02.289
Hank is up early.

32:02.322 --> 32:03.558
Does he live here?

32:03.591 --> 32:06.594
He never leaves.
Both of his parents were heroes.

32:06.628 --> 32:08.462
He has a lot to live up to.

32:08.495 --> 32:11.599
The emergency beeper
please, yes? Thank you.

32:11.633 --> 32:15.269
Always remember to bring an
extra change of clothes.

32:15.302 --> 32:17.471
Hey, when do we get paid?

32:17.505 --> 32:18.472
Every week.

32:18.506 --> 32:21.375
Crime doesn't pay, but
being a hero sure does.

32:21.408 --> 32:24.044
We'll send you out with Hank.
Learn the ropes.

32:24.077 --> 32:26.246
Doc will be working
on your new suits.

32:26.280 --> 32:27.981
So what are his powers?

32:28.015 --> 32:30.718
Hank doesn't have any.
Both his parents were supers.

32:30.752 --> 32:32.554
Yes,
when both parents are heroes

32:32.587 --> 32:35.422
it usually doesn't get passed
down to the kiddos.

32:35.456 --> 32:38.325
I apologize for being
rude, Good morning Joe Martin.

32:38.358 --> 32:39.727
What is that?

32:39.761 --> 32:42.429
That, my chubby friend is a
super computer mainframe.

32:42.463 --> 32:44.031
My name is LEXII.

32:44.064 --> 32:45.466
Hi, my name's Joe Martin.

32:45.499 --> 32:49.036
It can do anything
that you ask it to. Ask it anything.

32:49.236 --> 32:51.171
ANYTHING.

32:51.639 --> 32:53.440
Well, I could use a tune up.

32:53.474 --> 32:54.441
Ok, Joe.

32:54.475 --> 32:55.375
That's it?
That's all you got?

32:55.409 --> 32:58.746
A local towing
service has been dispatched.

32:58.780 --> 32:59.747
Computer!

32:59.781 --> 33:00.748
Yes Larry?

33:00.782 --> 33:01.916
Give me a bloody mary.

33:01.950 --> 33:04.084
Blood alcohol levels indicate
that you have already had 2.

33:04.117 --> 33:05.285
I don't care if I've
already had 2.

33:05.319 --> 33:07.488
Don't worry your AA sponsor
has already been alerted...

33:07.522 --> 33:09.089
Are you a computer
or my mother?!

33:09.122 --> 33:11.058
...as well as your court
appointed attorney.

33:11.091 --> 33:12.226
Answer his question.

33:12.259 --> 33:14.261
A towing service has been
dispatched to your residence,

33:14.294 --> 33:15.195
No way!

33:15.597 --> 33:17.699
Maintenance of your vehicle has
been assigned to Hank Horowitz.

33:17.732 --> 33:21.803
I'm surprised it didn't respond
with your cars's a piece of crap

33:21.836 --> 33:23.605
Because your car
is a piece of crap.

33:25.239 --> 33:26.574
Welcome to the team.

33:26.841 --> 33:29.176
So you're gonna be
teaching me the ropes huh?

33:30.545 --> 33:32.346
I'm guessing there's
a lot to learn.

33:33.313 --> 33:34.314
You know I really appreciate

33:34.348 --> 33:36.316
all the help with this tune up
and everything.

33:36.350 --> 33:38.620
I mean, I've just
been out of work for so long.

33:38.653 --> 33:40.788
Sarah and I we just really
couldn't afford this.

33:43.357 --> 33:45.527
Hey, so I guess you learned all
this stuff from your dad?

33:45.994 --> 33:47.829
I mean he was
pretty good huh?

33:47.862 --> 33:49.496
Hey did you ever think
about asking Doc for

33:49.531 --> 33:51.498
a little help in the super
powers department?

33:52.165 --> 33:54.536
He tried making me a suit once,

33:54.569 --> 33:56.470
but I'd rather use
what god gave me.

33:56.504 --> 33:57.437
That's noble.

33:57.471 --> 33:59.139
You know what god gave me?

33:59.172 --> 34:00.307
Thighs that rub.

34:00.340 --> 34:03.043
So do you think Doc's gonna give
me a cool suit to wear?

34:04.044 --> 34:06.480
I'm not gonna lie, I'm really
excited about this.

34:06.514 --> 34:09.551
I know it's just a temporary
one, but it's gonna be awesome!

34:09.583 --> 34:13.387
I mean, you know, I guess it's
just one of the perks right?

34:13.420 --> 34:16.757
You get to say cool things, like
"Stop evil-doer!"

34:17.224 --> 34:19.126
You get to wear cool outfits.

34:19.761 --> 34:21.563
Swing from rooftops.

34:22.730 --> 34:24.164
Hey have you guys ever
thought about

34:24.197 --> 34:26.132
doing like a slow-mo walk,

34:26.166 --> 34:28.235
like in Armageddon where you
all just kind of walk out...

34:28.268 --> 34:29.804
You know you could die
from doing this.

34:30.672 --> 34:32.540
All heroes
in the downtown corridor

34:32.574 --> 34:34.308
please respond
to a 10-70.

34:34.341 --> 34:36.476
Break in at refined
metals storage unit.

34:36.511 --> 34:37.612
Proceed with caution.

34:45.152 --> 34:46.821
First appearance in front of
your enemies is everything.

34:47.054 --> 34:48.221
No fear.

34:48.255 --> 34:49.255
Yeah, but I'm not ready.

34:49.289 --> 34:50.257
No fear.

34:50.290 --> 34:52.159
I'm not ready-
- No fear!

34:52.192 --> 34:53.460
I'm not ready.

34:53.493 --> 34:54.696
No fear.

34:55.763 --> 34:57.230
Stop evil doers!

34:57.264 --> 35:00.200
It is I, the Nightwatchman.

35:00.902 --> 35:02.870
Sarah.

35:02.904 --> 35:04.404
Sarah!

35:04.438 --> 35:05.873
It is also I!

35:05.907 --> 35:08.509
Average Joe!

35:13.246 --> 35:16.249
Holy crap, it's the kid!
Let's get out of here!

35:20.253 --> 35:21.288
Impressive.

35:21.321 --> 35:22.824
Yeah? You think so?

35:22.857 --> 35:24.626
Cuz when we first got out here,
I was kinda nervous.

35:24.659 --> 35:26.761
Then my adrenaline was pumping
and everything...

35:26.794 --> 35:28.596
Hello Hank.

35:32.800 --> 35:33.901
Bobby?

35:33.935 --> 35:37.905
I'm Nightwatchman.

35:37.939 --> 35:40.575
No, I'm Nightwatchman.
We've been over this before.

35:40.608 --> 35:42.610
Who's your friend?

35:42.644 --> 35:44.177
My name's Joe, Average Joe.

35:44.211 --> 35:45.178
Joe don't.

35:45.212 --> 35:47.447
What, he's like 5.

35:47.481 --> 35:48.816
A very dangerous 6.

35:51.485 --> 35:53.621
AHHHHH!!!!!
AHHHHH!!!! AHHHH!!!!

35:53.655 --> 35:54.922
AHHHHH!!!!!

35:54.956 --> 35:56.624
You got whipped by a kid?!

35:56.658 --> 35:58.860
He's no kid,
he's Satan's minion.

35:58.893 --> 36:00.528
He's 6.

36:00.561 --> 36:01.929
A very dangerous 6.

36:01.963 --> 36:04.464
So much for getting your part
time job at Gymboree.

36:04.498 --> 36:06.834
I knew I should have hired
that kid when I had the chance.

36:10.571 --> 36:13.708
6AM! Tomorrow!

36:15.342 --> 36:17.679
Whatever.

36:29.423 --> 36:30.958
What's that?

36:30.992 --> 36:31.959
What's that?

36:31.993 --> 36:34.227
It's work, I got it.

36:34.261 --> 36:35.429
It's 6am.

36:35.462 --> 36:37.497
I know.
They're calling me, I gotta go.

36:39.667 --> 36:41.903
Good morning.

36:41.936 --> 36:43.671
I love you.

36:53.014 --> 36:55.016
The heart of a
hero should never be in doubt.

36:55.049 --> 36:58.686
We hold ourselves to a
higher standard.

36:58.720 --> 37:01.989
We do not allow
ourselves to understand fear.

37:02.023 --> 37:04.659
Over the next few weeks I will
be slowing myself down,

37:04.692 --> 37:06.661
not for my benefit,
but for yours.

37:06.694 --> 37:10.531
So that you can see what is
expected of a real hero.

37:13.467 --> 37:15.937
If you make a great entrance,
in your enemies mind,

37:15.970 --> 37:18.005
half the battle is
already won.

37:18.039 --> 37:20.608
Make no mistake gentlemen.

37:20.641 --> 37:23.376
My job is to break you.

37:23.410 --> 37:25.312
To punish you.

37:25.913 --> 37:28.816
To push you to your very limits

37:28.850 --> 37:32.720
so that when you are
faced with certain death,

37:32.754 --> 37:35.455
you will stand strong.

37:35.489 --> 37:37.024
Proud.

37:37.058 --> 37:39.326
Fearless.

37:41.596 --> 37:44.297
Like a true hero.

37:44.331 --> 37:46.500
Let's go!

37:52.807 --> 37:56.944
Never, under any circumstances
reveal your secret identities.

37:57.945 --> 37:59.580
Shut up Larry.

37:59.614 --> 38:01.716
Why you always
tell me to shut up?

38:15.096 --> 38:16.597
Baby catch.

38:16.631 --> 38:17.598
Baby catch?

38:17.632 --> 38:20.067
Yeah, baby catch.

38:20.101 --> 38:22.003
I'm gonna fling babies at you.

38:22.036 --> 38:25.606
In an emergency, know your
rallying points in the city.

38:35.550 --> 38:37.384
Ready? Hut! Go! Go!

38:37.417 --> 38:39.386
This one needs love,
she's adopted!

38:39.419 --> 38:42.557
This one's a preemie!
Get your hands up!

40:07.975 --> 40:09.176
Come on Joe!

40:09.210 --> 40:11.444
NothinG like a
baby to get you motivated.

40:11.478 --> 40:13.180
Don't drop me!

40:14.749 --> 40:16.183
Babies are coming in hot Joe!

40:16.217 --> 40:18.185
This one got thrown
out of a moving car!

40:18.219 --> 40:21.454
She's covered in oil,
she's slippery!

40:21.488 --> 40:24.058
This one's got parents
who are gonna miss her!

40:25.826 --> 40:26.794
Whoo!

40:26.827 --> 40:28.162
I'm a super hero!

40:28.195 --> 40:29.897
Wait Joe, no wait!

40:29.931 --> 40:32.934
Noooo!

40:36.103 --> 40:39.006
Hello Heinrich, I decided to
make a video for you

40:39.040 --> 40:42.009
with the outfit I was telling
you about.

40:42.043 --> 40:44.912
Doctor, I wasn't
feeling very good today,

40:44.946 --> 40:47.581
would you like to take my
temperature?

40:47.615 --> 40:51.585
It's blue!

40:51.619 --> 40:54.088
- Oh crap.
- Oh shit.

40:54.121 --> 40:55.756
Oh my gosh,
that's so exciting!

40:55.790 --> 40:56.757
Is it?

40:56.791 --> 40:57.825
Yes, I'm going to be an aunt!

40:57.858 --> 40:58.993
Is it?!
What am I going to do?

40:59.026 --> 41:00.728
What am I going to tell Joe?

41:00.761 --> 41:02.830
He's gonna be excited, won't he?

41:02.863 --> 41:05.566
But he's never here Em.
I mean this whole job thing.

41:05.599 --> 41:07.234
You think that I want to
raise this baby alone?

41:07.268 --> 41:09.770
Wait, wait wait!

41:09.804 --> 41:12.873
We are talking
about a baby right?

41:14.041 --> 41:16.677
What are you wearing?

41:20.982 --> 41:23.551
The test of the
machine was successful.

41:23.584 --> 41:26.053
We've waited a long time for
this moment Lord Menace.

41:26.087 --> 41:29.557
Time is a binding concept that
we no longer have any use for.

41:32.560 --> 41:36.597
MAX, I believe we
should visit an old friend.

41:38.599 --> 41:39.934
I'm sorry Heinrich.

41:39.967 --> 41:42.536
My system shows that with the
current power source,

41:42.570 --> 41:46.874
the new Average Joe suit
will not maintain plasma levels.

41:46.907 --> 41:48.909
Suit failure at 93.7 percent.

41:50.845 --> 41:53.180
So then why
am I getting power drains?

41:53.214 --> 41:57.051
Would you like me to run
diagnostics again?

41:57.084 --> 41:59.153
Heinrich, your wiring is bad.

41:59.186 --> 42:01.155
The power
source is inadequate.

42:04.025 --> 42:06.227
Maybe a flying
suit was too much.

42:06.660 --> 42:08.629
Actually, it might not be.

42:08.662 --> 42:11.599
Theoretically your flying
Average Joe suit could work.

42:11.632 --> 42:14.168
It seems with the internal
wiring and plasma emitters,

42:14.201 --> 42:18.839
the best power source for us
could be the remaining Terinium.

42:18.873 --> 42:20.574
With the Terinium power source,

42:20.608 --> 42:24.311
flight capability success
increases to 85.2 percent.

42:24.345 --> 42:27.848
Well beyond our
acceptable 70/30 ratio.

42:27.882 --> 42:30.251
Maybe Joe's suit is the reason
we've been holding on to the

42:30.284 --> 42:32.920
Terinium all these
years, Heinrich.

42:40.227 --> 42:41.429
Heinrich!

42:41.462 --> 42:44.698
My systems show an unauthorized
access to northwest corner 3.

42:44.732 --> 42:47.701
Unauthorized access to
main power panel.

43:19.834 --> 43:20.835
Mary?

43:40.955 --> 43:44.158
Hello Heinrich.
At last we meet.

43:51.232 --> 43:52.700
Joe is that you?

43:52.733 --> 43:54.268
Yeah, it's me.

43:55.703 --> 43:57.104
Close your eyes.

43:57.138 --> 43:59.106
I didn't forget our
anniversary did I?

43:59.140 --> 44:00.274
Come with me.

44:00.307 --> 44:02.409
Ok.
What are you doing?

44:02.443 --> 44:04.078
Just a little surprise.

44:04.445 --> 44:06.147
Ok, where's Emily?

44:06.180 --> 44:07.148
At our mom's.

44:07.181 --> 44:08.716
Oh, so a little surprise huh?

44:08.749 --> 44:11.218
No peeking.

44:11.252 --> 44:13.754
Ok, right here?

44:13.787 --> 44:14.889
Ok, you ready?

44:14.922 --> 44:16.757
Yeah.

44:16.790 --> 44:17.791
I hope you like it.

44:17.825 --> 44:21.262
Baby, I love everything you
do, you know that.

44:21.295 --> 44:22.696
3...

44:22.730 --> 44:23.731
2...

44:23.764 --> 44:25.299
Oh shit, hold on.

44:25.332 --> 44:26.300
Oh, Baby, I gotta go.

44:26.333 --> 44:28.235
Joe, just 2 seconds!

44:28.269 --> 44:30.437
Baby, I'm sorry, I would but
this is an emergency.

44:30.471 --> 44:32.072
It's an emergency.

44:32.106 --> 44:35.042
Joe that is all you
ever have anymore.

44:35.075 --> 44:36.744
Baby, this is my job.

44:36.777 --> 44:39.446
Oh, even when they call you out
at 3am, that's your job?

44:39.480 --> 44:41.882
Sarah, I don't need this
from you right now.

44:41.916 --> 44:43.751
Ok, I can't do
this by myself Joe.

44:43.784 --> 44:45.719
You have gone from
one extreme to another.

44:45.753 --> 44:47.454
I never see you anymore.

44:47.488 --> 44:51.825
Sarah, you know that I love you,

44:51.859 --> 44:55.462
But I have to go do this.

44:55.496 --> 44:57.097
My hero.

45:00.501 --> 45:01.969
I know.

45:24.058 --> 45:27.361
All units, all units please
respond to a 10:33

45:27.394 --> 45:31.498
Warehouse fire at city property
warehouse at 10100 Riverside.

45:31.533 --> 45:33.767
Armed suspects
possibly on the scene.

45:33.801 --> 45:36.136
Report of explosion,
proceed with caution.

45:43.911 --> 45:44.945
What the hell?

45:45.547 --> 45:46.681
What happened?

45:46.715 --> 45:48.215
Looks like somebody
paid you guys a visit.

45:48.249 --> 45:50.518
The only one that
was here was Mystico.

45:50.552 --> 45:52.186
So,
you work here at these facilities?

45:52.219 --> 45:56.190
Yes, my name is Dr. Mystico,
I'm part of a superhero team,

45:56.423 --> 45:58.959
and this here is our main
headquarters.

45:59.159 --> 46:00.327
Balls!

46:01.095 --> 46:03.531
Sir can you tell us
what happened here tonight?

46:05.299 --> 46:08.936
It was a firefight!

46:09.270 --> 46:10.904
Ma'am can you tell us your name?

46:10.938 --> 46:12.339
Do you work with this gentleman?

46:12.373 --> 46:13.374
If you want a comment,

46:13.407 --> 46:16.477
you'll have to go through
the mayor's office.

46:25.185 --> 46:26.920
Did anyone call
Captain and Hallenbeck?

46:26.954 --> 46:29.089
Yes, they're on their way.

46:31.959 --> 46:35.563
So Doc, you're telling
us this has all been the same guy?

46:35.597 --> 46:39.033
For a while now, we have
suspected a certain someone

46:39.066 --> 46:41.268
at the heart of this crime wave.

46:41.302 --> 46:44.171
His name...
Lord Menace.

46:44.204 --> 46:46.340
Look Doc,
at first it was just theft

46:46.373 --> 46:49.243
and gathering of
materials and resources.

46:49.276 --> 46:50.911
But then at the
warehouse?

46:50.944 --> 46:52.446
When I was first with you guys?

46:52.479 --> 46:55.583
There was a machine.
A time portal, but it was

46:55.617 --> 46:59.053
missing a very important
piece of the puzzle.

46:59.621 --> 47:04.391
It required a power
source of extreme magnitude.

47:04.425 --> 47:07.562
Just like the one in your suit.

47:08.395 --> 47:10.464
Doc, what did you do?

47:10.898 --> 47:12.399
I think you can fly now.

47:12.433 --> 47:13.934
WHAT?!

47:13.967 --> 47:15.369
What?!

47:15.402 --> 47:17.104
You've got 30 seconds.

47:17.505 --> 47:18.707
Mrs. Mayor.

47:18.740 --> 47:21.475
And you,
who said you were fit to give interviews?

47:21.509 --> 47:24.646
And to talk to my office for an
official statement?

47:24.679 --> 47:27.081
Mrs. Mayor you have every right
to be upset with me.

47:27.114 --> 47:28.949
Do I?

47:28.982 --> 47:33.220
I left you in charge because
you said you could handle it.

47:33.253 --> 47:35.489
And it turns out you're the
worst one out of

47:35.523 --> 47:37.324
all these degenerates.

47:37.358 --> 47:39.226
Mayor, I think these
guys might be on to something.

47:39.259 --> 47:40.994
Johnson! You keep
him on a short leash or

47:41.028 --> 47:43.163
I'll have him kicked
back to traffic duty.

47:43.197 --> 47:44.164
Do you get me?

47:44.198 --> 47:45.366
Yes Ma'am.

47:45.399 --> 47:48.502
This crime wave is
only the beginning.

47:48.536 --> 47:51.238
That's ominous.

47:51.271 --> 47:53.907
I think this is all
just a shake down.

47:53.941 --> 47:57.044
There is no threat.

47:59.079 --> 48:03.183
The city doesn't need you, let
the real heroes handle this.

48:03.217 --> 48:05.352
hiding behind desks in
whatever profession you had

48:05.386 --> 48:09.591
before this.
This project is terminated.

48:13.595 --> 48:17.064
You're an
embarrassment to women.

49:08.048 --> 49:10.050
You did what you could.

49:12.554 --> 49:14.988
There is no confirmation
from arson investigators yet,

49:15.022 --> 49:18.258
but reporters did manage to
speak to a man calling himself

49:18.292 --> 49:20.595
Dr. Mystico who may
have been involved.

49:20.628 --> 49:23.731
Reports on the scene were
interrupted by a woman,

49:23.765 --> 49:26.634
possibly implicating the
Mayor's office as well.

49:26.668 --> 49:29.203
For now the scene has been
closed off by police

49:29.236 --> 49:30.672
and arson investigators.

49:30.705 --> 49:34.074
Neither the Mayor's office or
SAPD has made themselves

49:34.107 --> 49:36.443
available for comment.

50:25.359 --> 50:28.061
Well, it's certainly
not as large as your last office, but

50:28.095 --> 50:30.698
it's nice to have you back.

50:31.164 --> 50:35.102
From wherever you were.

50:35.537 --> 50:37.137
Latte!

50:38.238 --> 50:41.208
Monkey!

50:44.211 --> 50:47.549
Take this nice lady's
car to the back would you?

50:48.550 --> 50:50.518
It's what I do.

50:50.552 --> 50:53.120
Go. Go.

50:54.354 --> 50:56.858
Good news only MAX.

50:56.891 --> 50:59.661
Otherwise, I'll turn you
into a bread warmer.

50:59.694 --> 51:01.361
We still cannot find Mystico.

51:01.395 --> 51:03.798
The Mayor's office has
disbanded the heroes.

51:04.364 --> 51:07.067
Then that means
they'll be lost forever.

51:08.135 --> 51:11.371
My frequency intercepted
a call to a tv station.

51:11.405 --> 51:13.273
A woman named Emily
reporting that she knew

51:13.307 --> 51:15.475
Mystico, but she does
not know his location.

51:15.510 --> 51:17.712
She stated her
brother-in-law works with him.

51:17.946 --> 51:20.815
It could be the hero
we've heard about,

51:20.848 --> 51:22.717
Average Joe?

51:24.318 --> 51:26.320
If that is
indeed her brother-in-law,

51:26.353 --> 51:28.756
then I would very much like to
find out who is wife is.

51:29.657 --> 51:31.893
And where we can find her.

51:31.926 --> 51:34.194
But, why Average Joe?

51:36.196 --> 51:38.365
Leverage MAX.

51:38.398 --> 51:43.103
In times of crisis,
this city needs its heroes.

51:43.437 --> 51:47.307
If we find Average Joe,
we find Mystico.

51:48.308 --> 51:50.444
It's moving day!

51:50.477 --> 51:53.748
Unfortunately we
have been politely asked to

51:53.781 --> 51:57.250
dispose of my life's work.

51:59.453 --> 52:02.657
That's ok.
That's ok.

52:02.690 --> 52:05.392
I really wanted to
see this in action.

52:05.425 --> 52:07.595
To see you in action.

52:07.629 --> 52:09.631
Did you sleep here last night?

52:09.931 --> 52:11.465
Sarah left.

52:12.466 --> 52:13.901
It's no sweat Joe.

52:13.935 --> 52:16.804
Do you know what the divorce
rate is for superheroes?

52:17.639 --> 52:20.374
Me neither, I'm
sure its pretty high though.

52:21.475 --> 52:23.477
Who wants pancakes?

52:25.947 --> 52:27.447
Me!

52:27.982 --> 52:29.282
I'm wearing the shirt.

52:31.853 --> 52:34.221
Pick up, pick
up, pick up, pick up.

52:34.421 --> 52:36.456
Ok, let's keep it
orderly please.

52:36.490 --> 52:38.760
Single file line,
next to your bus buddy.

52:38.993 --> 52:41.529
Quietly.

52:41.562 --> 52:42.697
Hello?

52:42.730 --> 52:43.898
Sarah?

52:43.931 --> 52:46.466
You left before I had a chance
to talk to you this morning.

52:46.500 --> 52:47.735
Let me call you back Em. Ok?

52:47.769 --> 52:49.202
I'm getting kids
loaded for a field trip.

52:49.236 --> 52:50.270
No, Sarah, look.

52:50.303 --> 52:52.472
I think I know why Joe hasn't
been around lately.

52:52.507 --> 52:54.642
I don't have
time for this.

52:54.676 --> 52:56.476
And don't you dare take
Joe's side on this.

52:56.511 --> 52:58.211
Ok, I'm the one who's pregnant
and going to have to

52:58.245 --> 52:59.379
raise this baby on my own.

52:59.413 --> 53:01.549
I am not taking Joe's side!

53:01.582 --> 53:04.819
Oh, this gets better and better.

53:04.852 --> 53:06.721
Heinrich's been real
secretive about what he's doing.

53:06.754 --> 53:08.221
But then last night
on the news...

53:10.658 --> 53:12.627
Ok, I'll call you back
after I'm done dealing with them.

53:12.660 --> 53:14.962
Hey, you guys!

53:14.996 --> 53:16.030
Sarah?

53:16.064 --> 53:18.666
Damnit, I finally have
something important to say!

53:18.700 --> 53:21.536
You guys, off the bus right
now and to the back of the line.

53:21.869 --> 53:22.837
Sarah Martin?

53:22.870 --> 53:24.204
AAAAhh!

53:24.237 --> 53:27.975
Please put down your phone,
you have 20 seconds to comply.

53:28.009 --> 53:29.877
Thank you.

53:36.517 --> 53:38.653
All units,
all units respond to a 10-33,

53:38.686 --> 53:40.888
armed suspect has
hijacked a school bus

53:40.922 --> 53:44.859
heading west into the downtown
corridor along I-35 near BAMC.

53:44.892 --> 53:48.596
5 hostages taken including 4
children and an adult female.

53:49.063 --> 53:52.033
Suspect considered armed and
extremely dangerous.

53:52.066 --> 53:53.266
Proceed with caution.

53:53.300 --> 53:54.334
Hey!

53:54.367 --> 53:55.937
Again,
all units respond to a 10-33.

53:55.970 --> 53:57.805
Come on, we gotta go.

53:57.839 --> 53:59.640
Here we go!

53:59.674 --> 54:03.443
Big moment, big
moment. Here we go!

54:03.477 --> 54:04.579
Ok Riggs, drive!

54:04.612 --> 54:05.847
I'm not your secretary!

54:05.880 --> 54:08.616
SAPD air support has
been dispatched and is en route.

54:09.217 --> 54:10.852
Copy that central,
this is EagleEye.

54:10.885 --> 54:13.554
We are airborne and
en route for air support, over.

54:21.062 --> 54:22.496
Do ya'll need anything else?

54:22.530 --> 54:24.599
Aspirin. Lots of aspirin.

54:27.635 --> 54:28.770
So, you and Em?

54:29.837 --> 54:33.040
Yeah, but she
doesn't know about us,

54:33.074 --> 54:34.776
she definitely doesn't know
about Lord Menace,

54:34.809 --> 54:36.043
so we're good.

54:36.077 --> 54:38.378
Tell me more about
this Lord Menace guy.

54:38.411 --> 54:42.382
Lord Menace, he was...
he was my mentor.

54:42.415 --> 54:44.284
Austria, 1850.

54:44.819 --> 54:45.953
He was a brilliant man.

54:45.987 --> 54:47.822
Brilliant scientist named Hans.

54:49.489 --> 54:51.092
Hans?

54:51.125 --> 54:52.994
That makes sense.

54:53.027 --> 54:56.329
You see Joe, I was Hans' lab
assistant for quite a few years.

54:56.363 --> 54:57.598
We had been developing
our theories

54:57.632 --> 54:59.634
on creating new
power sources,

55:00.134 --> 55:02.402
and that's how we created these
things quite by accident.

55:02.937 --> 55:03.971
What things?

55:04.005 --> 55:06.874
The crystals. The crystals that
I use to teleport.

55:07.074 --> 55:11.746
Well, it's not necessarily
teleportation, it's more of a

55:11.779 --> 55:14.081
moving forward through
time just a few moments.

55:14.115 --> 55:16.851
You see time
travel is very tricky.

55:16.884 --> 55:19.887
It's quite easy to move forward,
but to move back...

55:19.921 --> 55:21.856
is impossible.

55:21.889 --> 55:23.925
But Hans was
convinced otherwise.

55:24.391 --> 55:28.495
You see time travel
requires lots of energy,

55:28.529 --> 55:30.565
so we obtained a
substance called Terinium.

55:32.399 --> 55:34.467
Terinium?
Terinium.

55:34.501 --> 55:36.103
And on our first experiments...

55:36.137 --> 55:38.371
Hans wanted to keep
his hands clean.

55:38.973 --> 55:40.041
Hans free.

55:40.074 --> 55:42.076
So wanted
me to perform them.

55:42.944 --> 55:45.412
Without telling me exactly how
dangerous this was.

55:45.445 --> 55:46.446
What a jerk!

55:46.479 --> 55:47.682
I know!

55:48.683 --> 55:50.885
There was an explosion.

55:50.918 --> 55:54.555
I was lucky,
but Hans was left deformed.

55:54.589 --> 55:55.990
Changed.

55:56.023 --> 55:56.991
Changed to what?

55:57.024 --> 55:58.693
To something else.

55:59.994 --> 56:01.494
What?

56:01.529 --> 56:04.665
He decided to change
his name, to Lord Menace.

56:04.699 --> 56:07.467
Which I agree with, it sounds
better, cooler, more evil...

56:07.500 --> 56:08.903
Looks good on a poster.

56:08.936 --> 56:11.038
It works, yes
it's more marketable.

56:11.072 --> 56:15.142
You see now, as Lord Menace he
continues his reign.

56:15.176 --> 56:16.844
Trying to go back

56:17.578 --> 56:19.914
and change the mistakes
that we have made.

56:19.947 --> 56:21.682
Like the mistakes
I made last night.

56:21.716 --> 56:24.051
Recreate history in
his own image.

56:26.187 --> 56:28.055
Well, what about
the Terinium?

56:30.725 --> 56:32.727
The last known Terinium on earth

56:34.528 --> 56:35.963
is contained in your suit.

56:38.733 --> 56:40.735
These pancakes
look good don't they?

56:43.204 --> 56:45.840
This is 20-William-12,
we have 10-6 in the area,

56:45.873 --> 56:49.442
entering I-10 and Woodlawn,
joining pursuit of school bus.

56:49.476 --> 56:51.545
"Hello Heinrich"

56:51.579 --> 56:52.613
'Hello Heinrich"

56:52.647 --> 56:54.615
It's Emily. Stay quiet.

56:54.649 --> 56:55.583
Hello!

56:55.616 --> 56:56.584
Hello Heinrich.

56:56.617 --> 56:58.719
How are you my strawberry crepe?

56:58.753 --> 57:00.888
I don't know, why don't
you look up and find out.

57:02.489 --> 57:03.490
Shit.

57:05.760 --> 57:08.162
What, you've never had
a woman mad at you before?

57:09.931 --> 57:11.198
What's this?

57:11.232 --> 57:12.533
Morning Joe.

57:12.566 --> 57:14.001
How did you find us ...?

57:14.035 --> 57:15.036
I tracked your phone.

57:15.069 --> 57:17.004
You're not the only techie in
this relationship.

57:17.038 --> 57:19.206
I want to know why you were on
the news last night.

57:19.240 --> 57:20.875
And you have some
explaining to do!

57:20.908 --> 57:21.876
Where's Sarah?

57:21.909 --> 57:23.811
Are you what I think you are?

57:23.844 --> 57:25.179
Superheroes?!

57:27.181 --> 57:29.617
Ha ha, that's preposterous.

57:29.650 --> 57:30.818
Is it?!

57:30.851 --> 57:31.819
Yes.

57:31.852 --> 57:32.820
Is it?

57:37.258 --> 57:40.227
Dispatch,
we have a visual going east on I-10.

57:40.261 --> 57:41.929
Standby.

57:43.130 --> 57:44.665
This is 4-Victor-7,
we just spotted

57:44.699 --> 57:46.200
an adult female in the bus.

57:47.969 --> 57:49.570
It's ok you guys, it's ok.

57:51.005 --> 57:53.174
They're crossing the I-35
interchange.

57:56.277 --> 57:58.478
What the hell is that?

58:02.283 --> 58:04.185
Aaaaaahhhhhhh!

58:06.754 --> 58:08.723
We just lost 7,
we just lost unit 7.

58:08.756 --> 58:10.758
Unit 12, be advised
shots fired. Shots fired.

58:10.791 --> 58:12.927
Yeah, we saw that, thank you.

58:12.960 --> 58:14.494
We're doomed!

58:15.563 --> 58:16.964
It's ok you guys. It's ok.

58:19.834 --> 58:21.035
Joe.

58:23.637 --> 58:27.608
Oh my god.
Somebody turn that up.

58:27.641 --> 58:29.977
A squad car has lost control.

58:30.011 --> 58:31.612
Police are continuing
the pursuit,

58:31.645 --> 58:33.147
but if the suspect at
the wheel is armed...

58:33.180 --> 58:36.250
10 years ago I would
have been all over that.

58:38.719 --> 58:39.954
Suits in the van right?

58:39.987 --> 58:41.889
We're in just as
much shock as you are right now

58:41.922 --> 58:43.924
at what just happened.

58:44.859 --> 58:48.662
Joe.
Joe! No don't!

58:48.696 --> 58:50.264
I gotta see this.

58:54.335 --> 58:58.105
We're going to stay live
with this video as long as we can.

58:58.139 --> 59:00.307
Joe, no what are you doing?
You can't do this!

59:00.341 --> 59:03.310
Actually, you
look really good.

59:03.344 --> 59:06.113
No, what am I saying,
you can't do this.

59:06.147 --> 59:07.381
You're not ready.
We're not ready.

59:07.415 --> 59:10.317
My wife's a school teacher, Doc.
What if it was her out there?

59:10.351 --> 59:12.586
I won't get caught.
Trust me.

59:12.620 --> 59:13.854
I mean, it's like you said,

59:13.888 --> 59:15.923
Do what you were
born to do right?

59:15.956 --> 59:17.324
Oh, now you listen to me.

59:17.358 --> 59:19.760
Ok Joe, you have a new
advanced suit.

59:19.794 --> 59:21.262
You just hold your
arms out to glide

59:21.295 --> 59:23.197
and the thrusters will adjust
you automatically.

59:23.230 --> 59:24.432
Alright, got it.
And the Terinium?

59:24.465 --> 59:27.068
I'm actually kind of curious
myself to see what will happen.

59:27.101 --> 59:28.803
Doc!
You're gonna get killed.

59:28.836 --> 59:30.204
Yeah, why aren't you up there?

59:30.237 --> 59:31.772
My suit's at the cleaners.

59:31.806 --> 59:34.809
Right, Alright, back up,
everybody back up.

59:34.842 --> 59:35.743
Here we go.

59:35.776 --> 59:38.879
Ok Joe, just
ease into the controls and-

59:38.913 --> 59:41.015
Aaahh!

59:42.683 --> 59:45.719
Oh yeah, this should end well.

59:47.788 --> 59:49.290
..the horrific
situation that our city-

59:49.323 --> 59:51.192
Turn that up!

59:51.392 --> 59:53.260
I say again,
suspect at the wheel

59:53.294 --> 59:55.629
is armed and
extremely dangerous.

59:55.663 --> 59:58.099
And probably a robot.

01:00:02.736 --> 01:00:04.839
Too fast! Too fast, too fast!

01:00:05.172 --> 01:00:06.941
Whoah!

01:00:06.974 --> 01:00:08.876
Whoohoo!

01:00:08.909 --> 01:00:11.912
All units be advised, a flying
man has entered the scene!

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:13.848
It's a flying man!

01:00:13.881 --> 01:00:15.883
Really, what?

01:00:26.093 --> 01:00:28.395
I can fix that.

01:00:31.966 --> 01:00:34.401
Whoah!

01:00:35.436 --> 01:00:38.072
Yes!

01:00:38.105 --> 01:00:39.773
I thought your suit
was at the cleaners?

01:00:39.807 --> 01:00:42.743
Hey, it was ready
a little early.

01:00:42.776 --> 01:00:45.045
Alright, hang on.
We're going in!

01:00:47.448 --> 01:00:50.151
All units,
2 flying men have now entered the pursuit.

01:00:50.184 --> 01:00:51.785
Hold your fire.

01:00:51.819 --> 01:00:52.853
It's Larry!

01:00:52.887 --> 01:00:55.122
MAX,
pick up your visual scanning.

01:01:32.459 --> 01:01:34.762
Everybody back off, let's give
these guys some room.

01:01:35.462 --> 01:01:37.164
Bring it!

01:01:51.779 --> 01:01:53.814
We're gonna crash!

01:01:53.847 --> 01:01:55.482
Holy shit, we're gonna crash!

01:01:55.517 --> 01:01:56.750
MISS!

01:01:56.784 --> 01:01:58.452
Everybody down!

01:01:58.485 --> 01:02:00.955
Joe! Get out!

01:02:21.275 --> 01:02:23.377
This is the
best field trip ever!

01:02:23.877 --> 01:02:25.513
We have to get
back to the office!

01:02:25.547 --> 01:02:27.881
That was awesome!

01:02:38.526 --> 01:02:40.528
Look, there he is!

01:02:46.433 --> 01:02:48.235
Contact, rear!

01:02:50.437 --> 01:02:52.139
Shots fired! Shots fired!

01:02:52.172 --> 01:02:54.875
Backup units proceed with
caution, suspect is still armed!

01:02:54.908 --> 01:02:56.910
I have Joe's wife Lord Menace.

01:02:56.944 --> 01:02:59.113
Return to base.

01:03:00.582 --> 01:03:02.483
I think it's time...

01:03:08.355 --> 01:03:12.527
...for my grand entrance.

01:03:17.298 --> 01:03:20.100
We're not supposed
to reveal our identities!

01:03:20.134 --> 01:03:21.935
You told a news reporter!

01:03:21.969 --> 01:03:24.305
Nobody ever wants to
talk to me!

01:03:25.472 --> 01:03:29.243
Oh, you're so hot
when you're mad!

01:03:29.276 --> 01:03:31.912
Scanning all frequencies.

01:03:34.114 --> 01:03:36.383
Mrs Mayor! Mrs. Mayor!

01:03:40.622 --> 01:03:43.190
Can you confirm a report of a
man flying over the freeway?

01:03:43.223 --> 01:03:45.959
We are not ready to make an
official statement.

01:03:45.993 --> 01:03:47.461
In light of today's
incident on the freeway,

01:03:47.494 --> 01:03:49.463
we will be doing a
complete investigation.

01:03:49.496 --> 01:03:51.865
Now, we are
committed to due process,

01:03:51.899 --> 01:03:54.034
so please allow us
to do our jobs.

01:03:54.068 --> 01:03:56.470
Any further questions can be
relayed to our media relations

01:03:56.503 --> 01:03:57.404
Thank you.

01:03:57.438 --> 01:03:59.873
Get Captain Johnson
on the phone, now!

01:04:00.508 --> 01:04:01.475
Oh my gosh!

01:04:01.509 --> 01:04:02.476
Ha ha ha!!

01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:03.477
We can fly!

01:04:03.511 --> 01:04:04.478
That was amazing!

01:04:04.512 --> 01:04:05.312
That was awesome!

01:04:05.346 --> 01:04:07.081
Hold on man, we aren't hugging.

01:04:07.114 --> 01:04:08.082
No?

01:04:08.115 --> 01:04:09.283
No, go ahead, bring it in.

01:04:09.316 --> 01:04:11.952
I don't care what the mayor
says, she can take me to jail,

01:04:11.985 --> 01:04:12.986
I don't even care!

01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:13.987
Joe is that you?

01:04:14.021 --> 01:04:15.255
Hey Doc, come in.

01:04:15.289 --> 01:04:17.458
Yeah wasn't that awesome?

01:04:17.491 --> 01:04:19.627
I just need to take a
look at your boosters.

01:04:19.661 --> 01:04:21.161
Sometimes things work good,

01:04:21.195 --> 01:04:22.896
sometimes they don't
work as good.

01:04:22.930 --> 01:04:24.231
You just need to get out of that

01:04:24.264 --> 01:04:25.533
and back into your
civilian clothes.

01:04:26.568 --> 01:04:28.536
Is that a phone?

01:04:28.570 --> 01:04:30.270
Wait, is it my cell?

01:04:34.007 --> 01:04:35.275
Joe, it's Sarah!

01:04:35.309 --> 01:04:37.010
Just patch it through!

01:04:39.681 --> 01:04:40.648
Sarah?

01:04:40.682 --> 01:04:42.550
Joe Martin?

01:04:43.417 --> 01:04:44.418
Who is this?

01:04:44.451 --> 01:04:47.388
I wanted to call and
tell you what a big fan I am,

01:04:47.421 --> 01:04:49.957
after your splendid
performance today.

01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:52.126
I made a great effort to get
your attention this morning,

01:04:52.159 --> 01:04:56.096
but you flew off before we could
properly introduce ourselves.

01:04:56.130 --> 01:04:57.965
How did you get Sarah's phone?

01:04:57.998 --> 01:04:59.967
Is Heinrich with you?

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.003
I believe he calls himself
Dr. Mystico?

01:05:03.270 --> 01:05:04.639
What you failed to notice Joe,

01:05:04.672 --> 01:05:07.509
was who was on that bus you
saved today.

01:05:07.542 --> 01:05:09.143
Turn to channel eight.

01:05:09.176 --> 01:05:11.445
Mary,
did you see what's going on outside?

01:05:17.084 --> 01:05:18.318
Again, breaking news.

01:05:18.352 --> 01:05:21.589
Gunfire has erupted downtown,
as gunmen led

01:05:21.623 --> 01:05:24.726
by two robotic looking
individuals have seized control

01:05:24.759 --> 01:05:26.226
of the Westin Center.

01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:28.162
We've also just received a
message from a man

01:05:28.195 --> 01:05:30.230
calling himself Lord Menace,

01:05:30.264 --> 01:05:33.167
taking responsibility for this
morning's bus chase.

01:06:08.402 --> 01:06:11.238
I guess we're not going to have
time for a taco huh?

01:06:12.439 --> 01:06:13.474
Thank you Ernie.

01:06:13.508 --> 01:06:15.309
We are here live downtown where
it appears that a

01:06:15.342 --> 01:06:17.444
mechanical device
has been taken onto the streets

01:06:17.478 --> 01:06:20.147
at Pecan, directly in front of
the Westin Center.

01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:23.083
It appears the device is
creating some sort of cloud

01:06:23.116 --> 01:06:25.452
or disturbance in the sky
directly above us

01:06:25.486 --> 01:06:28.222
Eyewitness on the ground are
reporting that it is made of

01:06:28.255 --> 01:06:30.424
some sort of toxic
gas, but this is only a

01:06:30.457 --> 01:06:31.492
suggestion at this point.

01:06:31.526 --> 01:06:33.628
Neither the police office or the
mayor's office are

01:06:33.661 --> 01:06:36.430
categorizing this as an act of
terrorism, but

01:06:36.463 --> 01:06:38.733
it is confirmed that the
metallic figure spotted...

01:06:38.766 --> 01:06:41.636
in today's highway
chase is involved.

01:06:41.669 --> 01:06:44.338
It also appears that the young
school teacher kidnapped

01:06:44.371 --> 01:06:47.441
this morning is with them, along
with another female hostage.

01:06:47.474 --> 01:06:50.778
Police are issuing orders that
everyone evacuate the

01:06:50.812 --> 01:06:53.380
downtown corridor
immediately.

01:07:04.692 --> 01:07:06.661
Hallenbeck! You alright?

01:07:06.694 --> 01:07:08.328
Well, we barely made
it off the freeway alive!

01:07:08.362 --> 01:07:10.497
You're still alive and I
need a tactical response.

01:07:10.532 --> 01:07:12.466
We don't have one yet sir.

01:07:12.499 --> 01:07:14.468
Yes we do!

01:07:14.501 --> 01:07:16.203
Captain, we've
seen this thing in action,

01:07:16.236 --> 01:07:18.472
it's gonna take more than what
our SWAT team can do.

01:07:18.506 --> 01:07:20.708
This thing wants what
Joe and Mystico have.

01:07:20.742 --> 01:07:23.377
And I want a tactical response!

01:07:26.213 --> 01:07:28.215
Well, I guess you made up your
mind about what you are going

01:07:28.248 --> 01:07:30.284
to do Hallenbeck.

01:07:30.317 --> 01:07:32.286
Don't let me stop you.

01:07:32.319 --> 01:07:35.657
Let's get Average Joe!

01:07:35.690 --> 01:07:39.126
We're gonna get fired!

01:07:45.867 --> 01:07:47.835
Joe! It's Hallenbeck.

01:07:47.869 --> 01:07:49.436
We need you.

01:07:49.469 --> 01:07:51.873
Yeah, of course.
Yeah, we'll back you up.

01:07:51.906 --> 01:07:55.108
We'll give you
whatever you need.

01:07:56.878 --> 01:07:59.379
I gotta go pick out a gun!

01:07:59.413 --> 01:08:02.717
Ma'am, leave it. Come on, we
gotta go. This way!

01:08:09.524 --> 01:08:13.226
Miss Maddox,
he says he knows you.

01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:17.564
It's okay.

01:08:19.567 --> 01:08:21.769
What are you doing here?

01:08:21.803 --> 01:08:23.170
The team is gonna need us Mary.

01:08:23.203 --> 01:08:24.606
Hank I don't have time to
discuss this...

01:08:24.639 --> 01:08:26.139
So you're just going to
watch this whole thing

01:08:26.173 --> 01:08:27.474
from four blocks away?

01:08:27.508 --> 01:08:30.545
- There's nothing I can do!
- Yes there is!

01:08:30.578 --> 01:08:34.348
Now, you can choose to sit on
your spoiled ass and do nothing,

01:08:34.381 --> 01:08:37.417
or you can do what
you were born to do.

01:08:37.451 --> 01:08:38.886
Be a hero.

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:40.220
I can't!

01:08:44.424 --> 01:08:45.792
You're a coward.

01:08:54.267 --> 01:08:55.903
This morning's
freeway chase seems to be just

01:08:55.937 --> 01:08:59.774
the tip of the iceberg. As a man
calling himself Lord Menace has

01:08:59.807 --> 01:09:02.274
taken over the streets in front
of the Westin Center.

01:09:02.309 --> 01:09:03.911
Along with members
of the Angel gang,

01:09:03.944 --> 01:09:06.246
they have taken two
female hostages

01:09:06.279 --> 01:09:09.383
and moved a large mechanical
device onto the streets.

01:09:09.416 --> 01:09:12.720
The device in question did fire
a beam into the skies above us

01:09:12.754 --> 01:09:15.421
and a large cloud of light and
energy is currently hovering

01:09:15.455 --> 01:09:18.859
over the city. The only question
is now, if there are in fact

01:09:18.893 --> 01:09:22.663
superheroes in San Antonio, will
they come to the rescue and stop

01:09:22.697 --> 01:09:26.934
this apparent super villain.

01:09:26.968 --> 01:09:29.737
To the man who calls
himself Lord Menace,

01:09:29.770 --> 01:09:31.572
I have a message for you.

01:09:31.606 --> 01:09:33.407
For far too long...

01:09:33.439 --> 01:09:37.545
this city's heroes have been
forced to sit in the shadows,

01:09:37.578 --> 01:09:38.946
unsure of their place.

01:09:40.581 --> 01:09:44.986
Not knowing whether or not this
city that they care for

01:09:45.019 --> 01:09:48.421
would embrace them
or reject them.

01:09:51.425 --> 01:09:52.960
Because of you,

01:09:52.993 --> 01:09:57.364
our city now faces the greatest
danger it's ever known.

01:09:57.397 --> 01:09:59.934
But I promise you this,

01:09:59.967 --> 01:10:02.302
not one life will be lost today.

01:10:03.604 --> 01:10:06.908
Because guarding over this
city...

01:10:08.910 --> 01:10:10.912
...is this city's heroes.

01:10:14.481 --> 01:10:16.884
We are your guardians.

01:10:20.621 --> 01:10:22.255
We are
your protectors.

01:10:38.639 --> 01:10:41.509
Because the heart of
a hero is never in doubt.

01:10:47.648 --> 01:10:49.851
We do not understand fear.

01:10:54.655 --> 01:10:57.390
And when faced
with certain death...

01:10:59.761 --> 01:11:01.394
we will stand strong....

01:11:04.732 --> 01:11:06.734
proud....

01:11:08.401 --> 01:11:10.403
and fearless.

01:11:19.781 --> 01:11:21.649
We will leave no one behind.

01:11:21.682 --> 01:11:23.618
Evacuate everyone.

01:11:34.461 --> 01:11:36.296
And as for you Lord Menace,

01:11:37.165 --> 01:11:40.467
I'm speaking to you not
as a hero but as a husband.

01:11:41.869 --> 01:11:43.905
You picked the
wrong wife to kidnap.

01:11:45.139 --> 01:11:46.808
Because now...

01:11:46.841 --> 01:11:48.910
I'm going to beat the
shit out of you.

01:11:51.612 --> 01:11:53.614
It has been an
honor Lord Menace.

01:12:03.490 --> 01:12:05.960
Yo Joe!

01:12:05.993 --> 01:12:07.995
Here to save the city?

01:12:08.495 --> 01:12:10.531
I'm here to save my marriage!

01:12:11.132 --> 01:12:13.500
Heinrich, you coward!

01:12:13.901 --> 01:12:15.636
You left me for dead!

01:12:16.003 --> 01:12:17.905
You were just a head!

01:12:17.939 --> 01:12:20.007
How was I supposed to know?

01:12:20.473 --> 01:12:22.977
I can see that.
I can totally see that.

01:12:23.010 --> 01:12:24.912
Do you
have any idea how long

01:12:24.946 --> 01:12:26.948
it took me to crawl
out of that wreckage?

01:12:26.981 --> 01:12:29.116
To rebuild a new body?

01:12:29.150 --> 01:12:31.953
Try using an Alan wrench
when you're just a head!

01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:35.890
Ok, I am genuinely
sorry about that!

01:12:35.923 --> 01:12:37.457
You will be.

01:12:38.025 --> 01:12:40.928
Give MAX the Terinium, Joe.

01:12:40.962 --> 01:12:43.865
And your wife doesn't
have to suffer.

01:12:43.898 --> 01:12:44.899
Much.

01:12:58.646 --> 01:13:00.648
Alright, that's it!

01:13:09.489 --> 01:13:11.025
Duck!

01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:22.570
MAX, get me that Terinium!

01:13:22.603 --> 01:13:24.605
With pleasure.

01:13:33.748 --> 01:13:35.448
Can't you make
anything that works?

01:13:35.482 --> 01:13:36.449
I said fifty-fifty.

01:13:36.483 --> 01:13:37.785
I heard seventy-thirty.

01:13:37.818 --> 01:13:39.153
Here comes MAX!

01:13:43.691 --> 01:13:46.527
Doc, how vulnerable would he be
if he didn't have that Tin Man?

01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:50.665
Extremely, he would have to fire
the Terinium himself.

01:13:50.698 --> 01:13:52.967
It's rebooting.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.201
Can't you just
teleport over there?

01:13:54.235 --> 01:13:55.303
It's too close to the beam.

01:13:55.336 --> 01:13:57.104
The field would neutralize and I
would be burned alive.

01:13:57.138 --> 01:14:00.708
I have an idea.
Hank! Hank!

01:14:00.741 --> 01:14:03.210
What'll happen
if we overload the grid?

01:14:03.244 --> 01:14:04.211
I was afraid you'd say that.

01:14:04.245 --> 01:14:06.213
That's not gonna work Joe!

01:14:06.247 --> 01:14:08.883
If you've got a better idea
Larry, now's the time!

01:14:08.916 --> 01:14:10.885
Hank, you and Mary just
worry about the hostage alright?

01:14:10.918 --> 01:14:13.554
It's still buffering,
you'll be able to fly but you can't fire.

01:14:13.587 --> 01:14:15.923
Yeah, but the suit will
still keep me protected right?

01:14:15.957 --> 01:14:16.924
Seventy-thirty.

01:14:16.958 --> 01:14:19.961
Yeah yeah right.

01:14:20.628 --> 01:14:23.664
Alright, if we're doing this,
we're doing it as a team right?

01:14:23.698 --> 01:14:24.765
Right.

01:14:24.799 --> 01:14:27.467
Alright, cover fire!

01:14:42.650 --> 01:14:45.553
Em! Em are you ok?

01:14:45.586 --> 01:14:47.655
I'm fine!

01:14:55.329 --> 01:14:56.731
Hey, hi Captain!

01:14:56.764 --> 01:14:58.766
Take cover Hallenbeck.

01:15:00.034 --> 01:15:02.136
Somebody call for backup?

01:15:02.169 --> 01:15:04.271
Let 'em have it boys!

01:15:04.305 --> 01:15:06.874
Sorry Hallenbeck, this was the
only hero I could find.

01:15:06.907 --> 01:15:09.844
Stop evil doer!
It is I! The Nudist!

01:15:09.877 --> 01:15:12.880
Prepare to meet your doom!

01:15:20.654 --> 01:15:22.923
Get down here!

01:16:28.089 --> 01:16:29.723
MAX!

01:17:10.431 --> 01:17:14.635
Nice try, but you are no hero.

01:17:17.972 --> 01:17:20.875
Your mother was a hero.

01:17:22.443 --> 01:17:26.413
Your father was a hero.

01:17:26.447 --> 01:17:28.415
But you?

01:17:28.449 --> 01:17:30.651
You are nothing.

01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:36.824
You are weak.

01:17:37.992 --> 01:17:40.728
Any last words Neutral?

01:17:40.761 --> 01:17:42.796
My name...

01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:44.865
is Hank!

01:18:13.961 --> 01:18:14.962
Nice entrance!

01:18:14.995 --> 01:18:15.996
You're pregnant?

01:18:16.030 --> 01:18:16.897
You're a superhero?

01:18:16.931 --> 01:18:18.832
You're pregnant?!
You're a superhero?!

01:18:18.866 --> 01:18:20.467
We have a lot to
talk about when we get home.

01:18:20.501 --> 01:18:22.836
Yeah, we do.

01:18:25.372 --> 01:18:28.275
God you look good
in that suit.

01:18:30.044 --> 01:18:33.013
Go, go!
Get somewhere safe!

01:18:33.047 --> 01:18:34.481
Come on!
Come on!

01:18:34.516 --> 01:18:37.218
It's nice to finally
meet you Sarah!

01:18:48.862 --> 01:18:52.032
One thing I've learned after all
these years, Joe...

01:18:52.066 --> 01:18:56.036
Time is irrelevant.

01:18:56.070 --> 01:18:59.073
What you are willing
to do for it...

01:18:59.106 --> 01:19:02.109
means everything.

01:19:12.886 --> 01:19:15.389
Holy!

01:19:15.422 --> 01:19:17.891
Shit!

01:19:36.176 --> 01:19:39.079
I can change it all.

01:19:39.113 --> 01:19:42.216
Be who I was meant to be.

01:19:42.249 --> 01:19:45.553
Change history,
rewrite every mistake.

01:19:45.587 --> 01:19:47.988
No more world wars.

01:19:48.022 --> 01:19:50.291
Right now I'm the
villain Joe,

01:19:50.324 --> 01:19:52.293
but I change history

01:19:52.326 --> 01:19:55.029
and I'm a savior knowing
what I know.

01:19:55.062 --> 01:19:57.064
I can do it all over again,
the right way, the way

01:19:57.097 --> 01:19:59.266
it was meant to be!

01:19:59.734 --> 01:20:02.936
I'll be damned if
you're the end of me.

01:20:04.371 --> 01:20:06.807
Now die a hero's death.

01:21:05.667 --> 01:21:10.104
No!!!

01:21:10.137 --> 01:21:12.473
Noooo!

01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:20.981
The past is mine.

01:21:21.014 --> 01:21:24.251
I can go back,
change everything!

01:21:24.284 --> 01:21:27.421
Think of the future
we can make for ourselves.

01:21:27.454 --> 01:21:29.923
I did think about the future
you son of a bitch!

01:21:31.358 --> 01:21:33.394
And you're history!

01:21:33.595 --> 01:21:35.896
AAAHH!

01:21:47.642 --> 01:21:49.910
AHHHHH!!!!!!

01:21:54.047 --> 01:21:57.050
AAAH!
AHHHHHH!!!!

01:22:35.690 --> 01:22:38.459
Sarah!

01:23:31.813 --> 01:23:35.482
Captain Richard Johnson.

01:23:35.517 --> 01:23:39.119
Emily Ritter.

01:23:39.152 --> 01:23:43.257
Mrs. Sarah Martin.

01:23:43.290 --> 01:23:47.629
Larry Leija.

01:23:52.534 --> 01:23:56.370
Heinrich
Rammelstein.

01:23:57.839 --> 01:24:02.142
Mary Maddox.

01:24:02.175 --> 01:24:06.046
Hank Horowitz.

01:24:07.447 --> 01:24:10.150
And the man who
protected his family,

01:24:10.183 --> 01:24:11.151
this city,

01:24:11.184 --> 01:24:13.755
our newest superhero and
the greatest example

01:24:13.788 --> 01:24:17.525
this city has that anyone
is capable of true heroism...

01:24:17.559 --> 01:24:20.093
Joe Martin!

01:24:20.127 --> 01:24:23.130
Average Joe.

01:24:55.162 --> 01:24:57.799
My hero.

01:24:57.832 --> 01:24:59.667
I know.
