Good morning to you, too.

03:19.623 --> 03:23.125
I swear, I think that I am
gonna kill this little punk.

03:23.127 --> 03:25.093
Nice. Okay.

03:25.095 --> 03:27.662
Who we killing?
This, uh,

03:27.664 --> 03:29.331
kid in Grace's math class--

03:29.333 --> 03:30.732
his name is 'Apane--

03:30.734 --> 03:34.002
and he's been texting her
nonstop. Text, text,

03:34.004 --> 03:35.170
text, text,

03:35.172 --> 03:36.805
text, text.

03:36.807 --> 03:38.440
How do you know
he's been texting her?

03:38.442 --> 03:40.809
Because I bought her
a new cellular phone

03:40.811 --> 03:43.245
and somehow in the
family cloud share plan,

03:43.247 --> 03:44.779
whatever you
call it, it got

03:44.781 --> 03:48.683
mixed up and I'm receiving
all of her text messages.

03:48.685 --> 03:50.352
So you've been spying on her.

03:50.354 --> 03:52.420
I'm not spying on my kid.
What'd I just say?

03:52.422 --> 03:53.788
Number one. Number two,
it's called parenting,

03:53.790 --> 03:55.290
so you know.

03:55.292 --> 03:58.360
It's also... spying.
All right?

03:58.362 --> 04:00.095
Look, I didn't
come here to, uh...

04:00.097 --> 04:02.597
What, you... What the hell
is that? What are you doing?

04:02.599 --> 04:04.633
What?

04:04.635 --> 04:07.035
What do you mean, "What?" You
just put butter in your coffee.

04:07.037 --> 04:08.937
Yeah, it's grass-fed butter.
Try it.

04:08.939 --> 04:10.872
You out of milk?
You out of your mind?

04:10.874 --> 04:12.607
What's the matter with you?

04:12.609 --> 04:14.609
No, it's a, uh,
it's a team guy thing.

04:14.611 --> 04:18.180
We do it to boost energy,
enhance brain function.

04:18.182 --> 04:20.214
Hey, enhance brain function--
you should try it.

04:20.216 --> 04:21.349
Maybe you'll
think more clearly.

04:21.351 --> 04:23.351
Oh, thank you. I think
I'll have my, uh,

04:23.353 --> 04:24.986
heart attack the
old-fashioned way.

04:24.988 --> 04:26.421
Well, suit yourself.

04:27.891 --> 04:30.725
This kid again.

04:32.595 --> 04:35.463
Relentless.
He is completely relentless.

04:35.465 --> 04:38.033
Listen to this one. I think you'll like it.
What is that?

04:38.035 --> 04:40.268
"Hey, G." Her name's
Grace, first of all.

04:40.270 --> 04:42.237
"What's your favorite
kind of candy?"

04:42.239 --> 04:43.505
She says Hershey's Kisses.

04:43.507 --> 04:46.308
He says, "Awesome.
Me, too." Yeah.

04:46.310 --> 04:48.143
You know why you think
it's funny?

04:48.145 --> 04:50.078
Because you don't
understand subtext. Subtext.

04:50.080 --> 04:51.479
They're two kids

04:51.481 --> 04:53.081
talking about candy

04:53.083 --> 04:54.516
the day before Valentine's Day.

04:54.518 --> 04:55.984
Romance is in the air,

04:55.986 --> 04:57.319
Danny.
Romance is in the air?

04:57.321 --> 04:59.921
Romance is in the air.
No, romance is not in the air.

04:59.923 --> 05:01.556
You know why?
Because she's 12.

05:01.558 --> 05:04.059
There should not be any romance
in her airspace, period.

05:04.061 --> 05:06.161
Would you listen to me
for a minute, please? Relax.

05:06.163 --> 05:07.963
Just relax.
She's a great kid.

05:07.965 --> 05:09.798
You raised her right.
You got to trust her.

05:09.800 --> 05:11.700
I do trust her.
I trust her very much.

05:11.702 --> 05:13.501
It's him-- this little thug--
I don't trust.

05:13.503 --> 05:14.703
All right.
Let's take him out.

05:14.705 --> 05:16.838
Okay, now you're talking.

05:18.608 --> 05:21.276
McGarrett.

05:21.278 --> 05:23.778
We're on the way.
We got to go.

05:23.780 --> 05:27.148
Sanitation crew came
across the car this morning.

05:27.150 --> 05:28.383
Any witnesses?

05:28.385 --> 05:30.452
Everyone was at
the Chinese New Year's Parade

05:30.454 --> 05:32.087
a block over.

05:32.089 --> 05:33.221
Dr. Shaw.

05:33.223 --> 05:35.824
What do we know?

05:35.826 --> 05:37.726
Just the obvious.
The depth of

05:37.728 --> 05:40.028
the ligature marks around
the victim's throat suggest

05:40.030 --> 05:42.330
the assailant was very powerful
and most likely male.

05:42.332 --> 05:44.299
All right, what about T.O.D.?

05:44.301 --> 05:46.935
Based on this stage
of rigor, I'd estimate

05:46.937 --> 05:49.004
between 10:00 p.m.
and midnight.

05:49.006 --> 05:50.438
Anything on him?

05:50.440 --> 05:53.041
Cash is still here.

05:53.043 --> 05:55.210
All right, so this definitely
wasn't a robbery.

05:55.212 --> 05:59.214
California guy.
Uh, Julius Brennan.

06:00.750 --> 06:03.551
What do you suppose this is for?

06:06.422 --> 06:09.024
What's that on his knee?
Right knee.

06:09.026 --> 06:11.660
Some sort of
grease stain.

06:11.662 --> 06:14.696
Looks fresh.

06:24.540 --> 06:27.375
He was looking for something
on the undercarriage here.

06:27.377 --> 06:29.344
What, like a bomb?

06:29.346 --> 06:30.312
Or a GPS device.

06:30.314 --> 06:31.780
All right,
so whatever it was,

06:31.782 --> 06:34.015
this guy thought somebody
was out to get him.

06:34.017 --> 06:36.251
Yeah, well, it looks like
he was right.

06:46.698 --> 06:50.082
As darkness falls on
the embattled city of Fallujah,

06:50.083 --> 06:52.450
the fighting
has only intensified.

06:52.452 --> 06:54.919
A short while ago,
we were forced to pull back

06:54.921 --> 06:58.189
and dig in here after taking
heavy mortar fire

06:58.191 --> 07:00.658
from the insurgent
stronghold behind me.

07:00.660 --> 07:02.793
Brennan was an award-winning
freelance journalist

07:02.795 --> 07:04.895
and documentarian.
Mm.

07:04.897 --> 07:08.099
Anybody bringing a camera
to a gunfight got my respect.

07:08.101 --> 07:09.333
You know, I got
to know some of

07:09.335 --> 07:10.601
these embeds when
I was downrange.

07:10.603 --> 07:12.036
I got to tell you,
they're a special breed.

07:12.038 --> 07:13.437
I mean, they're driven
and they're committed,

07:13.439 --> 07:16.073
but... they're crazy.

07:16.075 --> 07:18.075
Well, back in 2010,
he was seriously wounded

07:18.077 --> 07:19.377
covering the genocide
in the Congo.

07:19.379 --> 07:21.279
Made a full recovery
in the States.

07:21.281 --> 07:23.114
All right, we know what
he's been up to lately?

07:23.116 --> 07:24.248
Yeah, two years ago,

07:24.250 --> 07:26.284
he published a series
of freelance pieces

07:26.286 --> 07:27.852
on the surge
of violence in Detroit.

07:27.854 --> 07:29.620
He hasn't published
anything since then.

07:29.622 --> 07:31.656
What was he doing here on the island?
Don't know,

07:31.658 --> 07:33.791
but TSA has him
arriving a week ago.

07:33.793 --> 07:35.893
He purchased a one-way
ticket at LAX

07:35.895 --> 07:37.528
on the day
of the flight.

07:37.530 --> 07:39.630
All right, so, last-minute trip
to Oahu-- doesn't sound like

07:39.632 --> 07:42.133
he was coming here to just chill out.
I agree with you.

07:42.135 --> 07:44.368
Chin, reach out to some
of his previous employers,

07:44.370 --> 07:46.170
see if you can find out
anything about him

07:46.172 --> 07:47.772
working on a story
while he was here.

07:47.774 --> 07:50.041
Well, if he was, could be
the reason he was killed.

08:00.652 --> 08:02.086
You seem upbeat
today, Dr. Bergman.

08:02.088 --> 08:03.621
Oh, with very good reason.

08:03.623 --> 08:06.457
Tomorrow's Valentine's Day,
and I have planned

08:06.459 --> 08:09.493
a romantic evening with
my lovely paramour Sabrina.

08:09.495 --> 08:11.028
Man's got game.

08:11.030 --> 08:12.063
I like it.

08:12.065 --> 08:13.798
And may I ask what Cupid has

08:13.800 --> 08:15.900
in store for you?
I have a date with my Kindle

08:15.902 --> 08:17.368
and a nice bottle of Cab.

08:17.370 --> 08:19.437
Ah, how wonderfully pathetic.

08:19.439 --> 08:22.306
What's pathetic is a made-up
commercial holiday

08:22.308 --> 08:24.642
dedicated to the patron saint
of not only love,

08:24.644 --> 08:27.244
but of epilepsy,
fainting and the plague.

08:27.246 --> 08:29.246
Mm. Well,

08:29.248 --> 08:31.849
romantics,
such as myself, view

08:31.851 --> 08:33.751
Valentine's Day
as a perfect opportunity

08:33.753 --> 08:36.120
to express our true feelings
for the one we love.

08:36.121 --> 08:39.590
Saint Valentine was brutally
murdered by a Roman emperor.

08:39.592 --> 08:41.792
Where's the
love in that?

08:44.930 --> 08:46.430
Max?

08:46.432 --> 08:47.932
You ever seen

08:47.934 --> 08:50.301
anything like this before?
Never.

08:54.473 --> 08:56.140
Max, what are we
looking at here?

08:56.142 --> 08:58.209
What is this, some kind of
message from the killer?

08:58.211 --> 08:59.910
More like a message
from our Vic.

08:59.912 --> 09:01.979
The angle of the handwriting

09:01.981 --> 09:04.048
indicates Mr. Brennan
wrote on himself.

09:04.050 --> 09:05.583
It's called hypergraphia.

09:05.585 --> 09:06.984
It's a behavioral
condition

09:06.986 --> 09:10.154
characterized by an intense
desire to write.

09:10.156 --> 09:12.656
It's a symptom
associated with temporal lobe

09:12.658 --> 09:14.258
epilepsy and can be
triggered

09:14.260 --> 09:15.793
by high-stress
life events.

09:15.795 --> 09:17.461
He's had plenty of those.

09:17.463 --> 09:19.029
Yeah, or maybe
the stress of thinking

09:19.031 --> 09:20.531
somebody's out to kill you.

09:20.533 --> 09:22.233
Looks like a code.

09:22.235 --> 09:23.768
That was my first

09:23.770 --> 09:26.937
assumption as well,
until I took a closer look.

09:28.039 --> 09:29.707
The words are backwards.

09:32.310 --> 09:35.346
"Isolated, desolate,

09:35.348 --> 09:39.250
"solitary, trepidation,
dismay, consternation.

09:39.252 --> 09:41.819
3.14 pi
infinity..."

09:41.821 --> 09:43.587
What does this mean?
Do you guys understand this?

09:43.589 --> 09:45.556
It actually makes sense
that it doesn't make sense.

09:45.558 --> 09:47.725
Think of it as nervous doodling,

09:47.727 --> 09:50.194
a frenzied firing
of neurons in the brain.

09:50.196 --> 09:52.596
Some people who suffer
from hypergraphia

09:52.598 --> 09:54.465
write in a coherent
and logical manner.

09:54.467 --> 09:56.333
Others, like Mr. Brennan,

09:56.335 --> 09:58.502
have a more
jumbled style.

09:58.504 --> 10:00.438
Yeah, Kono?

10:00.440 --> 10:03.040
We tracked down the motel room
that our Vic was staying in.

10:03.042 --> 10:04.909
You're not gonna believe
what I'm looking at.

10:04.911 --> 10:06.710
Actually,

10:06.712 --> 10:08.712
I bet I can.

10:09.848 --> 10:11.849
I really hope
that Brennan left

10:11.851 --> 10:13.784
a credit card
for the incidentals.

10:13.786 --> 10:15.653
Well, HPD found the place
tossed when they arrived,

10:15.655 --> 10:17.021
but whoever
let themselves in--

10:17.023 --> 10:19.290
they did a number
on his camera and his laptop.

10:19.292 --> 10:21.258
They took the memory card
and the hard drive.

10:21.260 --> 10:22.526
And probably
anything else that could

10:22.528 --> 10:24.028
tell us what
he was up to.

10:24.030 --> 10:26.030
Well, they didn't
take his words.

10:26.032 --> 10:27.965
Maybe there's something
in all of this that can

10:27.967 --> 10:30.768
help clue us in to
what got him killed.

10:35.440 --> 10:37.107
Look, I'm not naive.

10:37.109 --> 10:39.310
I knew that eventually
this was gonna happen.

10:39.312 --> 10:40.845
You know, it was
inevitable my daughter's

10:40.847 --> 10:42.947
gonna start talking to boys.
I get it, she's 12.

10:42.949 --> 10:46.183
But, uh, I did not think
that I would have a, um,

10:46.185 --> 10:48.118
a front-row seat
to the, uh,

10:48.120 --> 10:49.653
prepubescent pillow talk.

10:49.655 --> 10:51.255
You know? And the emojis--
forget about it.

10:51.257 --> 10:53.524
I mean, I can't tell you
how much time I spent trying

10:53.526 --> 10:55.025
to decipher
what, uh,

10:55.027 --> 10:57.828
birthday cake, puppy dog,

10:57.830 --> 10:59.897
thumbs-up means, you know? So...

10:59.899 --> 11:01.565
I'm sorry, sir.
What is this about?

11:01.567 --> 11:03.400
What is it about?

11:03.402 --> 11:05.169
Are you... are you
listening to me?

11:05.171 --> 11:07.171
I-I don't want
my daughter's text messages

11:07.173 --> 11:08.672
to come on my phone anymore.

11:08.674 --> 11:10.741
Unfortunately,
this is customer service.

11:10.743 --> 11:12.910
I'll have to transfer you
to technical support.

11:12.912 --> 11:14.211
Please hold.

11:14.213 --> 11:16.447
Can...?

11:20.919 --> 11:22.987
You know, therapy
is an option.

11:22.989 --> 11:24.522
You know
that, right?

11:24.524 --> 11:25.990
Call the governor, get you back in.
You know,

11:25.992 --> 11:28.659
when I was a kid,
if I liked a girl,

11:28.661 --> 11:30.528
I had to go up
and talk to her, right,

11:30.530 --> 11:32.229
like, with my mouth,
a human being.

11:32.231 --> 11:35.165
Now, any kid with thumbs,

11:35.167 --> 11:37.268
a family share plan,
gets to walk around

11:37.270 --> 11:38.936
thinking they're the mack.

11:38.938 --> 11:40.504
The mack? You say "the mack?"

11:40.506 --> 11:41.605
The mack, yeah.
I don't know.

11:41.607 --> 11:42.907
It's the smooth jazz, baby.

11:42.909 --> 11:44.008
It's got me thinking
about the '90s, you know?

11:44.010 --> 11:45.276
Listen to me,
would you?

11:45.278 --> 11:46.410
You're doing
the right thing.

11:46.412 --> 11:48.512
Giving Grace some
space is good.

11:48.514 --> 11:50.247
Please continue to hold.

11:50.249 --> 11:52.950
Your expected wait time
is 38 minutes.

11:52.952 --> 11:57.154
38 minutes? 38 minutes,
38 seconds-- more of this music,

11:57.156 --> 11:58.355
I'm gonna kill myself.

11:58.357 --> 11:59.423
Grace isn't gonna have a father.

11:59.425 --> 12:02.026
I can't.

12:02.028 --> 12:03.794
Okay. I guess, uh,

12:03.796 --> 12:06.630
doing the right thing is
gonna have to wait, right?

12:14.874 --> 12:17.474
Special friend, or secret admirer?
Oh.

12:17.476 --> 12:19.843
Actually, I bought them
for myself.

12:19.845 --> 12:21.779
I know. It's pathetic, right?

12:21.781 --> 12:25.516
The popular conspiracy theory is
that Valentine's Day was created

12:25.518 --> 12:27.618
by the candy, floral and
greeting card industries

12:27.620 --> 12:29.253
to inflate sales.

12:29.255 --> 12:32.122
Yeah, I've heard that one.

12:32.991 --> 12:34.825
I think it's cynical.

12:34.827 --> 12:36.460
People go through
their lives,

12:36.462 --> 12:38.796
rarely taking time
to say "I love you,"

12:38.798 --> 12:41.298
so... what's one day a
year when you're forced

12:41.300 --> 12:43.267
to be nice to each other

12:43.269 --> 12:45.603
and acknowledge those
who are important to us?

12:45.605 --> 12:48.005
Wow, Jerry, that's...

12:48.007 --> 12:49.673
it's a really
beautiful sentiment.

12:49.675 --> 12:52.977
Well, I can...

12:52.979 --> 12:55.245
go deep every
once in a while.

12:56.815 --> 12:59.850
Here. Give it to someone
you care about.

13:01.252 --> 13:03.220
Thanks.

13:03.222 --> 13:05.255
I will.

13:05.257 --> 13:07.691
Max is expecting you.

13:10.929 --> 13:12.863
Ah, Mr. Ortega,

13:12.865 --> 13:14.398
what brings you to my room

13:14.400 --> 13:16.700
of post-mortal wonder?

13:16.702 --> 13:20.638
I came for the photos of the
writing on the victim's body.

13:20.640 --> 13:22.640
I've been asked to use
my considerable skills

13:22.642 --> 13:25.275
to mine the words
for possible clues.

13:25.277 --> 13:29.313
I could have saved you a trip
by e-mailing you those files.

13:29.315 --> 13:31.115
Right, pictures of a dead body

13:31.117 --> 13:33.884
sent to my e-mail address
over the Internet.

13:33.886 --> 13:34.952
No, thank you.

13:34.954 --> 13:37.688
I assure you,
our network is secure.

13:37.690 --> 13:39.923
You do realize we're all naked,

13:39.925 --> 13:42.393
living with millions
of strangers

13:42.395 --> 13:44.428
from all over the world,
in a giant glass house

13:44.430 --> 13:45.596
called the "Internet."

13:45.598 --> 13:47.998
I prefer to keep
my clothes on.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.701
I prefer that, as well.

13:50.703 --> 13:52.903
Allow me
to retrieve the photos.

13:58.077 --> 13:59.777
So, uh,

13:59.779 --> 14:02.980
when you, uh,
cut 'em open

14:02.982 --> 14:04.982
and, uh, rip out
the insides,

14:04.984 --> 14:07.084
what do you do
with the brains?

14:07.086 --> 14:09.887
Well, sometimes, we place them
into the body cavity

14:09.889 --> 14:11.321
before they're closed up.

14:11.323 --> 14:13.057
On occasion, we send them over

14:13.059 --> 14:15.092
to research
or diagnostic testing.

14:15.094 --> 14:17.061
Hmm.

14:17.063 --> 14:19.096
So, it is possible?

14:19.098 --> 14:20.497
Hmm?

14:20.499 --> 14:21.832
What's possible?

14:21.834 --> 14:23.300
Walt Disney,
Marilyn Monroe,

14:23.302 --> 14:25.235
Andy Kaufman, Jim Morrison--

14:25.237 --> 14:27.237
their brains could be
out there somewhere

14:27.239 --> 14:29.106
cryogenically frozen,
waiting for modern science

14:29.108 --> 14:32.309
to figure out a way to
implant them into a new body.

14:35.313 --> 14:36.980
Urban legend, my friend.

14:38.083 --> 14:41.285
Right.

14:41.287 --> 14:43.454
You keep telling yourself that.

14:47.258 --> 14:49.526
<i>What's the matter?</i>

14:49.528 --> 14:52.229
Nothing. Between a predator
texting my daughter

14:52.231 --> 14:53.630
and this animal
putting grass-fed butter

14:53.632 --> 14:54.998
in his coffee,
everything's fantastic.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.767
Really? I read somewhere
that that boosts energy

14:56.769 --> 14:58.035
and enhances brain function.

14:58.037 --> 14:59.503
Did you?

15:01.372 --> 15:03.807
Okay, Chin, we find anything?

15:03.809 --> 15:05.576
Take a look at this.

15:05.578 --> 15:07.644
Ran Julius's financials,
and got a hit

15:07.646 --> 15:08.712
on a credit card receipt

15:08.714 --> 15:10.147
from a restaurant
he was at last night.

15:10.149 --> 15:11.648
Looks like he was
dining with someone.

15:11.650 --> 15:13.584
All right, but his buddy
goes the other direction.

15:13.586 --> 15:15.085
I find it hard to believe
that he doubles back

15:15.087 --> 15:16.720
and beats Brennan to his car.
Well, maybe...

15:16.722 --> 15:19.156
Maybe this guy's job was to lure
Brennan into the restaurant

15:19.158 --> 15:21.592
and keep him there while
somebody else got in the car.

15:21.594 --> 15:22.559
All right. Well, let's see

15:22.561 --> 15:24.128
if his friend pops up
in our system.

15:38.076 --> 15:40.110
Ben Hamilton,

15:40.112 --> 15:42.346
U.S. Department of State.
Looks likes his last assignment

15:42.348 --> 15:44.515
was the U.S. Embassy
in the Congo.

15:46.051 --> 15:47.851
through 2011.

15:47.853 --> 15:49.720
Okay, Brennan was on assignment
there the same time.

15:49.722 --> 15:51.288
So, it's safe to assume
they knew each other.

15:51.290 --> 15:53.056
Doesn't mean
they liked each other.

16:06.859 --> 16:09.861
Yeah, of course I know Julius.

16:09.863 --> 16:11.997
We were friends.

16:11.999 --> 16:13.932
I just had dinner

16:13.934 --> 16:15.801
with the guy
last night.

16:15.803 --> 16:17.135
What the hell
happened?

16:17.137 --> 16:19.504
We were hoping
you could tell us.

16:19.506 --> 16:21.406
How did you two
know each other?

16:21.408 --> 16:23.508
We met in the Congo
a few years back.

16:23.510 --> 16:26.378
I was assigned to the U.S.
Embassy as a cultural attaché.

16:26.380 --> 16:27.980
He was in country

16:27.982 --> 16:29.982
covering the civil war.

16:29.984 --> 16:31.717
Julius was committed

16:31.719 --> 16:33.585
to showing the world
what was going on over there.

16:33.587 --> 16:35.387
So, you were there
when he was wounded?

16:35.389 --> 16:38.390
Spring of 2010. Yeah.

16:38.392 --> 16:41.893
A rebel militia advanced to
within a few miles of Kinshasa.

16:41.895 --> 16:43.695
They were slaughtering anyone
who got in their way.

16:43.697 --> 16:45.364
Women, children,
it didn't matter.

16:45.366 --> 16:47.566
The State Department

16:47.568 --> 16:50.669
called for the evacuation of all
press and embassy personnel,

16:50.671 --> 16:52.270
but Julius...

16:52.272 --> 16:53.538
Julius-- he wouldn't go.

16:53.540 --> 16:57.109
He was there to get a story,
and nothing was gonna stop him.

16:57.111 --> 16:59.645
Until he caught a sniper round
in the chest.

16:59.647 --> 17:02.214
Almost died.
He was lucky.

17:02.216 --> 17:04.516
Ended up with
a collapsed lung,

17:04.518 --> 17:06.284
a few broken ribs,
but that bullet missed his heart

17:06.286 --> 17:07.519
by a fraction of an inch.

17:07.521 --> 17:09.788
Mm-hmm. You know what
he was doing here on Oahu?

17:09.790 --> 17:11.089
Said he was here
on vacation.

17:11.090 --> 17:13.392
Called me up out of the blue,
invited me to dinner.

17:13.394 --> 17:15.694
I hadn't even talked
to the guy in a year or two.

17:15.695 --> 17:17.162
What did you two talk about?

17:17.164 --> 17:18.363
Caught up a bit,

17:18.365 --> 17:20.965
did some reminiscing
about Africa.

17:20.968 --> 17:23.335
But I got to be honest.

17:23.337 --> 17:27.606
The guy sitting across the table
from me last night

17:27.608 --> 17:29.941
is not the Julius I knew.

17:29.943 --> 17:31.209
It was strange.

17:31.211 --> 17:32.377
He was distracted,

17:32.379 --> 17:34.012
paranoid.
He kept looking around.

17:34.014 --> 17:35.447
Tried to talk
to him about it,

17:35.449 --> 17:39.084
to ask him what was going on,
but he just changed the subject.

17:39.086 --> 17:43.021
I got to say, when I left, I was
a little worried about the guy.

17:43.023 --> 17:44.510
He talk about seeing
anyone else while he was here?

17:44.534 --> 17:45.558
No, he didn't.

17:45.559 --> 17:46.858
If anything, I was afraid

17:46.860 --> 17:49.928
that Julius might be headed
for some kind of a breakdown.

17:51.731 --> 17:53.899
I never thought
he'd be murdered.

17:55.334 --> 17:58.303
So, Julius Brennan
had a lot on his mind.

17:58.305 --> 18:00.205
That explains
the hypergraphia.

18:00.207 --> 18:03.375
Yeah, and I don't believe
he was here on vacation, either.

18:03.377 --> 18:05.143
So, why didn't he tell Hamilton

18:05.145 --> 18:06.812
exactly why he was
really on Oahu?

18:06.814 --> 18:08.447
Well, maybe he
didn't trust him.

18:08.449 --> 18:11.149
He checked the undercarriage
of his car after their meeting.

18:11.151 --> 18:13.285
And the handshake on that video
doesn't exactly look

18:13.287 --> 18:15.554
like two old friends
saying good-bye to each other.

18:15.556 --> 18:18.156
And come on. Cultural attaché.

18:18.158 --> 18:20.225
I bet the CIA has
to give a class

18:20.227 --> 18:22.627
on how to say that with a straight face.
Right.

18:22.629 --> 18:25.464
All right, I'll ask McGarrett
to reach out to his contacts.

18:25.466 --> 18:27.229
See what else they can tell
us about our Mr. Hamilton.

18:27.253 --> 18:28.167
Mm-hmm.

18:28.168 --> 18:30.535
Hey, Jerry, what do you got?

18:30.537 --> 18:32.938
I'm not exactly sure, but

18:32.940 --> 18:34.806
I kept noticing
this recurring symbol

18:34.808 --> 18:36.475
in the writing
on Brennan's body.

18:36.477 --> 18:39.111
The arrow of
Sagittarius.

18:39.113 --> 18:40.604
Oh, like the constellation?

18:40.628 --> 18:42.794
I didn't know you were
a fellow astronomy buff.

18:43.817 --> 18:44.750
We should get up to Diamond Head

18:44.752 --> 18:46.151
one night
and do some stargazing.

18:46.986 --> 18:49.788
Pass, but thanks for the invite.

18:49.790 --> 18:51.857
Okay. Well,

18:51.859 --> 18:54.326
anyway, uh,
in this case,

18:54.328 --> 18:57.929
uh, the arrow is referring
to the Zodiac symbol

18:57.931 --> 19:01.032
of ancient Babylonian origin
representing the soldier.

19:01.034 --> 19:03.268
And then we found
these two names recurring

19:03.270 --> 19:04.803
in a few of the spirals

19:04.805 --> 19:06.638
on the walls
of the hotel room.

19:06.640 --> 19:08.206
Any idea who they are?

19:08.208 --> 19:09.641
Not "they." "He."

19:09.643 --> 19:10.942
You know, at
first, I thought

19:10.944 --> 19:12.077
they were two
different people,

19:12.079 --> 19:13.145
'cause they never
appear together.

19:13.147 --> 19:15.147
There was always words
in between them.

19:15.149 --> 19:16.782
Then I ran the two
names together,

19:16.784 --> 19:18.216
and this is
what I found.

19:18.218 --> 19:20.886
Patrice Thomas,
Congolese National.

19:20.888 --> 19:23.388
Fled to the U.S. in late 2009

19:23.390 --> 19:25.090
after he was granted
refugee status.

19:25.092 --> 19:26.992
And he settled in Oahu
a little over a year ago.

19:26.994 --> 19:28.593
Another guy
from the Congo.

19:28.595 --> 19:29.995
Brennan had to know him.

19:29.997 --> 19:31.797
We got to find him.

19:32.999 --> 19:34.766
Kid was

19:34.768 --> 19:36.234
a good employee.

19:36.236 --> 19:38.103
His boss said it wasn't
like him not to call,

19:38.105 --> 19:39.371
so he came over
to check on him

19:39.373 --> 19:41.873
when he was a no-show
for his valet parking job.

19:41.875 --> 19:43.575
Landlord lets him in,

19:43.577 --> 19:46.311
they find him like this.

19:46.313 --> 19:47.612
Duke's busy checking on whether

19:47.614 --> 19:49.848
he's got any next of kin
on the island.

19:49.850 --> 19:53.318
Liver temp puts time of death
at roughly 12 hours ago.

19:53.320 --> 19:55.921
And take a
look at this.

19:55.923 --> 19:57.322
Absence of bruising tells me...

19:57.324 --> 19:59.191
He was struck in the face
right before he died.

20:00.393 --> 20:02.494
He's been doing this a while.

20:02.496 --> 20:04.629
All right, this is very strange.
Uh, dope fiends

20:04.631 --> 20:07.032
do not usually keep
such a tidy apartment.

20:07.034 --> 20:08.500
They certainly
do not alphabetize

20:08.502 --> 20:10.802
their bookshelves,
all right?

20:10.804 --> 20:13.505
Kid's got no track
marks on him, either.

20:13.507 --> 20:15.607
What's this?

20:19.212 --> 20:20.545
It's the arrow
of Sagittarius.

20:24.083 --> 20:26.952
Scar tissue is deep

20:26.954 --> 20:28.153
and well-defined.

20:28.155 --> 20:31.189
This mark must have been here
for a few years.

20:31.191 --> 20:33.758
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say this guy's been branded.

20:34.894 --> 20:36.595
All right,
so somebody

20:36.597 --> 20:40.232
comes in here, try to make this
thing look like an overdose.

20:40.234 --> 20:42.400
I'm assuming whoever did this
did not want us

20:42.402 --> 20:44.135
to tie this kid
to Julius Brennan.

20:44.137 --> 20:45.737
Yeah, well...

20:45.739 --> 20:48.139
Well, that scar just did.

20:56.449 --> 21:00.218
They came at night
when we were sleeping.

21:01.654 --> 21:04.623
We woke to the screams
of our parents.

21:04.625 --> 21:07.792
We ran to their room.

21:07.794 --> 21:10.061
There were men.

21:11.631 --> 21:13.865
They had machetes.

21:13.867 --> 21:17.302
They stood ov...

21:17.304 --> 21:21.573
They stood over the bodies
of my parents.

21:23.442 --> 21:25.944
Blood dripping
from their blades.

21:27.246 --> 21:31.149
Wesley started
to wail.

21:31.151 --> 21:34.152
I tried to keep him
quiet, but I couldn't.

21:34.154 --> 21:38.356
One of the soldiers got angry,

21:38.358 --> 21:40.358
raised the machete
over his head,

21:40.360 --> 21:42.894
but before he
could strike,

21:42.896 --> 21:46.164
I yelled at
him to stop.

21:46.166 --> 21:49.134
I pleaded with him.

21:49.136 --> 21:51.636
Told him

21:51.638 --> 21:56.207
if he spared my
brother's life...

21:56.209 --> 21:59.844
I would join
Makoni's army.

22:01.113 --> 22:04.049
You're a special guy, Patrice.

22:05.418 --> 22:09.688
You survived in Roko Makoni's
army for four years.

22:09.690 --> 22:12.023
But then you escaped and...

22:12.025 --> 22:15.460
and found
your little brother again.

22:15.462 --> 22:18.763
Where will you go now?
What will you do

22:18.765 --> 22:20.532
if you can't make it to America?

22:24.270 --> 22:28.340
We would rather die
than stay here.

22:28.342 --> 22:31.509
I'm not gonna let that happen.

22:31.511 --> 22:33.545
And I promise you,

22:33.547 --> 22:35.613
I'm gonna tell your story,

22:35.615 --> 22:37.749
and we will show
the world

22:37.751 --> 22:41.219
who Roko Makoni is
and all

22:41.221 --> 22:43.688
the horrible things
that he has done.

22:48.461 --> 22:50.996
The interview was part
of the documentary

22:50.998 --> 22:53.498
that Brennan was making before
he was injured in the Congo.

22:53.500 --> 22:55.633
Uh, we got it from a film editor
he was working with.

22:55.635 --> 22:58.970
Who the hell
is this Roko Makoni guy?

22:58.972 --> 23:00.538
A Congolese
warlord.

23:00.540 --> 23:02.407
They call him the Chief.

23:02.409 --> 23:05.377
At one time, he was the most
wanted man in the world.

23:05.379 --> 23:07.012
What do you mean, "was"?

23:07.680 --> 23:10.215
Makoni was killed in a bombing

23:10.217 --> 23:11.683
by the Congolese
Air Force

23:11.685 --> 23:13.018
back in 2011.

23:13.020 --> 23:14.352
Smart money says

23:14.354 --> 23:16.488
the air strike was orchestrated
by the CIA.

23:16.490 --> 23:18.490
Apparently,
Makoni co-opted

23:18.492 --> 23:20.759
the arrow of Sagittarius
as a brand

23:20.761 --> 23:22.927
to mark his army
of kidnapped child soldiers.

23:22.929 --> 23:24.396
So...

23:24.398 --> 23:26.664
Patrice escapes Makoni's army,
comes to America

23:26.666 --> 23:28.767
where he thinks he'll be safe,
and is murdered.

23:28.769 --> 23:31.703
Probably by the same people
who killed Julius Brennan.

23:31.705 --> 23:34.305
But who would want both
of these guys dead?

23:34.307 --> 23:36.608
I may have the answer to that.
Patrice's phone records show

23:36.610 --> 23:38.510
that he and Brennan were
in contact with each other

23:38.512 --> 23:39.944
beginning a week ago.

23:39.946 --> 23:42.514
He also sent encrypted photos
to Brennan's cell phone,

23:42.516 --> 23:46.217
photos that the crime
lab just sent over.

23:47.053 --> 23:49.087
But if Brennan came
to see Patrice,

23:49.089 --> 23:50.822
why wouldn't
he tell Hamilton that?

23:50.824 --> 23:54.259
I think the better question is:
Why didn't Hamilton tell us?

23:54.261 --> 23:56.461
He's got to figure
into this somehow.

23:57.997 --> 24:00.932
That's the hotel
where Patrice worked.

24:00.934 --> 24:03.868
Okay, I don't get it.
An empty cab.

24:03.870 --> 24:06.104
Chin, do me a favor.
Pull up that license plate.

24:13.045 --> 24:15.647
Guys, that's Makoni.

24:15.649 --> 24:17.115
No, that's impossible.

24:17.117 --> 24:19.284
Roko Makoni was confirmed K.I.A.

24:19.286 --> 24:20.585
in an air strike.

24:20.587 --> 24:24.089
Confirmed by the government.
Looks like reports

24:24.091 --> 24:26.391
of his death
were greatly exaggerated.

24:39.903 --> 24:41.556
All right, my team,
bring it in.

24:41.557 --> 24:43.290
Bring it in. Let's go.

24:43.292 --> 24:45.158
The target is Roko Makoni.
He's a highly skilled,

24:45.160 --> 24:47.094
battle-tested soldier.

24:47.096 --> 24:50.531
This man is a major threat.
He has no conscience.

24:50.533 --> 24:52.533
So stay focused and
maintain situational awareness

24:52.535 --> 24:53.867
at all times.

24:53.869 --> 24:55.469
Okay, my team.

24:55.471 --> 24:56.904
This is our target.

24:56.906 --> 24:58.338
His name is Ben Hamilton.

24:58.340 --> 25:00.107
We're assuming
he's a retired CIA case officer.

25:00.109 --> 25:03.410
He is intelligent,
he is well-trained,

25:03.412 --> 25:05.145
and he's not gonna go down
without a fight.

25:05.147 --> 25:07.180
He's also the guy that
reported putting eyes

25:07.182 --> 25:10.484
on Makoni's corpse,
verified that in 2011

25:10.486 --> 25:12.686
Makoni was killed
in an air strike.

25:12.688 --> 25:14.187
Now, we believe

25:14.189 --> 25:16.323
that Hamilton faked
Makoni's death,

25:16.325 --> 25:18.358
provided him safe passage
to the U.S.

25:18.360 --> 25:20.961
in exchange for Makoni's cache
of blood diamonds.

25:20.963 --> 25:22.529
All right, everybody.

25:22.531 --> 25:25.699
These two threats
have everything to lose.

25:25.701 --> 25:27.834
So execute good target I.D.

25:27.836 --> 25:29.369
and muzzle
discipline.

25:29.371 --> 25:31.305
Any questions?

25:32.240 --> 25:33.240
All right, good.

25:33.242 --> 25:35.976
Let's go to work.

25:49.357 --> 25:51.158
Hands up.

25:51.160 --> 25:52.926
Do it now!

25:52.928 --> 25:54.494
I think we all know

25:54.496 --> 25:55.829
that's not gonna happen.

25:56.698 --> 25:58.966
It's over, Hamilton!

25:58.968 --> 26:00.167
You're out of options.

26:02.103 --> 26:03.503
I knew this day would come.

26:03.505 --> 26:05.272
A man like Makoni

26:05.274 --> 26:07.808
could never outrun his past.

26:07.810 --> 26:10.277
You aided and abetted
an international war criminal.

26:10.279 --> 26:11.712
Hands over
your head.

26:11.714 --> 26:13.847
Whatever you do,

26:13.849 --> 26:16.049
don't underestimate the Chief.

26:16.051 --> 26:18.418
- Even the devil's afraid of him.
- Enough!

26:18.420 --> 26:19.286
Last time!

26:19.288 --> 26:20.554
Hands over
your head!

26:26.628 --> 26:28.028
Gun!

27:20.081 --> 27:21.214
Moving!

27:30.825 --> 27:32.292
Clear!

27:40.935 --> 27:42.202
Stop it.

27:42.204 --> 27:43.637
Stop it.

27:43.639 --> 27:45.505
Get out.

27:47.275 --> 27:48.842
Get out. Get out!

27:51.446 --> 27:52.446
Whoa!

27:54.717 --> 27:56.683
Get out!

28:15.369 --> 28:17.704
All right, once he turns off
of Kuhio toward the Ala Wai,

28:17.706 --> 28:18.972
the cameras
don't pick him up again.

28:18.974 --> 28:20.174
He had to have ditched the car

28:20.175 --> 28:21.475
- somewhere in the neighborhood.
- He did.

28:21.477 --> 28:22.809
HPD just found the car

28:22.811 --> 28:24.044
abandoned near Beretania Park.

28:24.046 --> 28:25.345
They're canvassing
house to house.

28:25.347 --> 28:27.547
Okay, well,
Makoni's place is compromised,

28:27.549 --> 28:29.683
his picture's all over the TV,
Hamilton is dead.

28:29.685 --> 28:31.918
Where does he go from here?

28:31.920 --> 28:33.253
Well, it's not in
his DNA to surrender.

28:33.255 --> 28:34.721
And he's not gonna allow himself
to be captured.

28:34.723 --> 28:35.655
He'd rather die.

28:35.657 --> 28:36.823
Makoni's a soldier.

28:36.825 --> 28:37.958
I mean, he's a field general.

28:37.960 --> 28:39.226
He's gotta have
an extraction plan.

28:39.228 --> 28:41.261
<i>Trust me, he's imagined</i>

28:41.263 --> 28:43.196
<i>this scenario</i>
<i>at least 1,000 times,</i>

28:43.198 --> 28:46.466
<i>and whatever he's got planned,</i>
<i>we'll never see coming.</i>

28:46.468 --> 28:47.968
<i>Only thing we can be certain of</i>

28:47.970 --> 28:50.003
<i>is he knows he's not getting</i>
<i>off this island</i>

28:50.005 --> 28:52.706
<i>without some sort of leverage.</i>

29:07.688 --> 29:08.989
Royal Hawaiian Center, please.

29:08.991 --> 29:10.323
Come.

29:10.325 --> 29:12.759
If we don't get to him
before he has that leverage,

29:12.761 --> 29:13.994
we're not gonna have to look

29:13.996 --> 29:16.396
<i>too hard to find him.</i>

29:17.665 --> 29:19.599
Um...

29:19.601 --> 29:21.635
Excuse me.

29:21.637 --> 29:22.836
I, uh...

29:22.838 --> 29:24.437
I think we're going
the wrong way.

29:25.973 --> 29:27.974
Sir?

29:27.976 --> 29:29.843
Hey.

29:35.383 --> 29:36.716
What are you doing?

29:37.985 --> 29:40.020
- Open this door!
- No!

29:41.123 --> 29:42.522
No, Mom!

29:42.524 --> 29:44.257
Dad!

29:44.259 --> 29:46.426
What'd he do to you?

29:46.428 --> 29:47.794
Emergency. What is the problem?

29:47.796 --> 29:50.163
My name is Roko Makoni.

29:50.165 --> 29:52.632
I'd like to speak
to Commander Steve McGarrett.

30:02.401 --> 30:04.002
<i>All units be advised,</i>

30:04.004 --> 30:07.105
<i>hostage situation on the corner</i>
<i>of Kapuni and Cleghorn.</i>

30:07.107 --> 30:09.241
<i>Commander McGarrett</i>
<i>has tactical lead.</i>

30:09.243 --> 30:11.910
<i>Police are evacuating</i>
<i>the scene.</i>

30:11.912 --> 30:13.545
<i>Bomb squad is en route.</i>

30:23.856 --> 30:26.124
Understand me, Commander McGarrett.

30:26.126 --> 30:28.460
If these people die,
it's on you.

30:28.462 --> 30:30.395
You know what I want.

30:30.397 --> 30:31.863
The helicopter is being
fueled as we speak,

30:31.865 --> 30:32.964
and everything

30:32.966 --> 30:34.466
you've asked for is in motion.

30:34.468 --> 30:35.734
All right, now, I need to know

30:35.736 --> 30:37.135
how the man
in the backseat is doing.

30:37.137 --> 30:38.737
If I were you,

30:38.739 --> 30:40.672
I'd be more worried
about the C-4

30:40.674 --> 30:41.973
in my trunk.

30:42.808 --> 30:44.476
I am worried.

30:44.478 --> 30:45.877
Okay? I am worried.

30:45.879 --> 30:47.112
But I also want
to send a doctor

30:47.114 --> 30:48.914
out there to check
on that man's wounds.

30:48.916 --> 30:50.548
So you understand
what I'm saying to you?

30:50.550 --> 30:52.584
In a few minutes, he won't matter.

30:52.586 --> 30:53.818
He's got nothing
to do with this.

30:53.820 --> 30:55.420
He does not need to die.

30:58.325 --> 30:59.758
All right.

30:59.760 --> 31:02.027
You care so much, you come.

31:02.029 --> 31:03.662
I'm not a doctor.

31:03.664 --> 31:05.630
Today, you will have to be.

31:15.608 --> 31:17.409
Steve?

31:17.411 --> 31:20.679
Hey. You sure
this is a good idea?

31:20.681 --> 31:23.448
That's a stupid question.

31:25.685 --> 31:27.652
Hey. Be careful.

31:27.654 --> 31:29.521
Oh, no, that's...

31:29.523 --> 31:31.089
that's not in his vocabulary.

31:31.091 --> 31:32.824
He doesn't know that one.

31:32.826 --> 31:34.125
Oh, man...

32:08.427 --> 32:09.694
I need to open

32:09.696 --> 32:10.929
the back door,
please. Okay?

32:10.931 --> 32:12.664
Can I open
the door?

32:15.768 --> 32:17.035
I'm watching you.

32:19.639 --> 32:21.359
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be all right.

32:25.344 --> 32:27.912
I need to get this man
out of here right now.

32:27.914 --> 32:28.947
You still have two hostages.

32:28.949 --> 32:30.448
Close the door.

32:30.450 --> 32:32.450
Close
the door.

32:37.123 --> 32:38.690
Get on your knees.

32:39.925 --> 32:41.626
Do it!

32:41.628 --> 32:43.728
Please, please, don't!

32:44.730 --> 32:46.798
Easy. Easy.

32:47.833 --> 32:49.234
You think I'm a monster,

32:49.236 --> 32:51.469
don't you?

32:51.471 --> 32:53.304
That makes it simple for you.

32:53.306 --> 32:55.807
Monsters aren't real.

32:55.809 --> 32:57.275
You are.

32:59.245 --> 33:02.814
You see, I wasn't born into
the privilege of your country.

33:02.816 --> 33:06.317
I was born in a place
where there is no living.

33:06.319 --> 33:09.387
You survive or you die.

33:09.389 --> 33:11.956
I gave those children a purpose.

33:11.958 --> 33:13.158
A cause.

33:13.160 --> 33:15.260
Something to believe in.

33:15.262 --> 33:17.395
"A cause"?

33:17.397 --> 33:19.197
That's what you call
kidnapping and rape?

33:19.199 --> 33:20.331
Murder? "A cause"?

33:20.333 --> 33:23.635
Our enemies are swayed
more by fear

33:23.637 --> 33:25.603
than reverence.

33:25.605 --> 33:27.639
You put guns and machetes
in the hands of children

33:27.641 --> 33:29.040
and turn them into killers.

33:29.042 --> 33:31.376
I turned them into soldiers!

33:31.378 --> 33:33.178
Do you know why you're here?

33:33.180 --> 33:35.346
Huh?

33:35.348 --> 33:38.249
'Cause I wanted you here.

33:38.251 --> 33:40.285
I wanted to look into your eyes

33:40.287 --> 33:43.788
and hear you say
you agree to my demands.

33:43.790 --> 33:46.491
Okay, well, I've done
everything you asked.

33:49.795 --> 33:52.730
I have seen many men cower

33:52.732 --> 33:55.066
under the shadow of a blade

33:55.068 --> 33:58.303
or the barrel of a gun.

33:58.305 --> 34:00.138
Your actions may be
that of a brave man,

34:00.140 --> 34:01.239
Commander.

34:01.241 --> 34:04.776
But your eyes tell
me you are a liar!

34:04.778 --> 34:06.511
Do it.

34:10.748 --> 34:13.418
Good work, Kono.

34:13.420 --> 34:14.786
Not too many people

34:14.788 --> 34:17.355
in this world can make that
shot the way that you can.

34:17.357 --> 34:19.290
So, the question is:
Why is he still breathing?

34:19.292 --> 34:20.925
Because a bullet to the head

34:20.927 --> 34:23.628
would've been
way too easy for him.

34:44.817 --> 34:46.117
All right!

34:46.119 --> 34:48.018
The bomb squad has
the crime scene!

34:48.021 --> 34:49.954
I need all
nonessential personnel

34:49.956 --> 34:52.090
to clear this area right now!

34:52.092 --> 34:53.591
Let's go! Let's go!

34:53.592 --> 34:55.493
Let's go!
Patch that shoulder up.

34:55.495 --> 34:56.793
He's got a long flight
to the Hague.

34:56.795 --> 34:59.030
You and I will see
each other again.

34:59.032 --> 35:00.865
I hope so.

35:02.268 --> 35:04.002
Let's go! Get them
out of there right now!

35:04.004 --> 35:06.171
Come on! Go! Clear!

35:06.173 --> 35:07.939
Clear! Clear!

35:08.841 --> 35:10.542
Let's go! Back!

35:16.949 --> 35:18.249
Could've killed you.

35:20.419 --> 35:22.053
To be honest, I wasn't
really thinking abut that.

35:22.055 --> 35:23.821
Oh, no?

35:23.823 --> 35:27.358
Oh, that's funny.

35:27.360 --> 35:29.861
We did good today, buddy.

35:29.863 --> 35:31.763
Yeah, we did.

35:32.798 --> 35:34.332
Well, what now?

35:34.334 --> 35:35.500
Wha-what happened?

35:35.502 --> 35:37.302
He offer to carry her books?

35:37.304 --> 35:38.336
No, no, no, no. He's, uh...
Huh?

35:38.338 --> 35:39.337
He's taking her
for an ice cream.

35:39.339 --> 35:40.838
"An ice cream"?
Yeah.

35:40.840 --> 35:42.106
Oh!

35:42.108 --> 35:43.274
Would you listen to me?

35:43.276 --> 35:45.176
You got to stop this.
It's ice cream.

35:45.178 --> 35:46.878
You're making yourself
crazy over nothing.

35:46.880 --> 35:49.681
Danny...
She lied to me. She lied to me.

35:49.683 --> 35:51.349
She told me she was going
over to a friend's to study.

35:51.351 --> 35:52.817
So she is now lying.

35:52.819 --> 35:55.720
All right, this, uh,
this ends now.

35:55.722 --> 35:57.121
Let's go.

36:05.698 --> 36:07.131
Try it again, okay?

36:07.133 --> 36:08.466
You can't mess up, okay?

36:08.468 --> 36:10.501
Ready? This way. One,

36:10.503 --> 36:13.238
two, three...

36:15.441 --> 36:17.108
Okay, let's try it again.

36:17.110 --> 36:19.744
Okay, let's
try it again.

36:19.746 --> 36:23.114
Two, three, slap.

36:23.983 --> 36:26.417
One...

36:27.686 --> 36:29.554
Under!

36:29.556 --> 36:30.556
Okay, ready?

36:30.557 --> 36:31.789
Okay, try it again.

36:31.791 --> 36:33.725
Okay, can't mess up
this time, okay?

36:33.727 --> 36:34.792
Okay.

36:34.794 --> 36:36.794
One...

36:40.699 --> 36:42.700
Oh, my goodness. Okay.

36:42.702 --> 36:43.768
Okay, one more time.

36:43.770 --> 36:45.970
One more time.

37:00.719 --> 37:02.520
I wouldn't be standing here

37:02.522 --> 37:05.790
if it weren't
for my brother's courage.

37:05.792 --> 37:09.761
We were just boys
when they took him.

37:09.763 --> 37:12.730
For four years,
he survived that hell.

37:13.799 --> 37:17.001
He didn't even know
what he was fighting for.

37:17.003 --> 37:19.304
Every night,

37:19.306 --> 37:22.307
I'd pray that he'll find a...

37:22.309 --> 37:24.309
his way out.

37:24.311 --> 37:26.611
And one day...

37:29.581 --> 37:32.350
...I opened up my eyes.

37:32.352 --> 37:36.220
And he's there.

37:37.856 --> 37:41.025
Standing over me with that...

37:41.027 --> 37:43.227
with that big, silly smile.

37:49.234 --> 37:51.903
We never stopped living
in fear of the Chief.

37:53.539 --> 37:56.708
Even after Mr. Brennan
helped us escape to America.

37:59.111 --> 38:00.878
We heard of Makoni's death.

38:00.880 --> 38:03.348
But with no body,

38:03.350 --> 38:07.251
we never quite believed
he was dead.

38:07.253 --> 38:09.487
Patrice and Julius Brennan

38:09.489 --> 38:13.424
died trying to bring
Makoni to justice.

38:13.426 --> 38:16.928
There's nothing more
noble than that.

38:21.233 --> 38:23.735
Your brother was a hero.

38:29.141 --> 38:31.309
He's with my parents now.

38:34.279 --> 38:37.548
I'm sure they're very proud.

39:01.106 --> 39:03.875
Raising kids is a lot
like grilling burgers.

39:03.877 --> 39:04.580
Uh-huh.

39:04.604 --> 39:06.245
You can't poke them
and prod them too much.

39:06.246 --> 39:09.147
All you can do is just
watch them closely

39:09.149 --> 39:11.582
and be there when
the flames jump up.

39:11.584 --> 39:13.050
That's it!
There you go.

39:13.052 --> 39:14.152
That's fantastic. Steve?

39:14.154 --> 39:16.254
Yeah?
You got to hear this.

39:16.256 --> 39:17.789
Grover is comparing, uh,
raising children

39:17.791 --> 39:20.391
to, uh, making hamburgers.

39:20.393 --> 39:22.560
I like it.
You like it?

39:22.562 --> 39:24.295
I like it.
Right.

39:24.297 --> 39:26.931
'Cause the analogy is free,
like, uh, the-the booze is free.

39:26.933 --> 39:28.599
The beers are free.
Everything is free.

39:28.601 --> 39:31.102
A little tip from the pro.

39:31.104 --> 39:32.970
Oh, boy.

39:32.972 --> 39:34.605
Rotate the patties
90 degrees on each side.

39:34.607 --> 39:36.507
Get them fancy,

39:36.509 --> 39:38.109
cross-hatch grill marks.

39:38.111 --> 39:40.077
Presentation is
everything, brah.

39:40.079 --> 39:41.546
Here's a little tip for you.

39:41.548 --> 39:43.481
How about you stick to sautéing

39:43.483 --> 39:45.383
them sea creatures,

39:45.385 --> 39:47.485
and let the guy from Chicago
handle the beef?

39:47.487 --> 39:49.787
My bad, OG.

39:52.925 --> 39:55.893
You know you're
staring, right?

39:55.895 --> 39:57.728
I'm pretty sure
Dr. Shaw and I had

39:57.730 --> 39:59.630
a moment yesterday
in the morgue.

39:59.632 --> 40:00.691
Hey!

40:00.715 --> 40:02.401
If it happened in the morgue,
it wasn't a moment.

40:02.402 --> 40:05.670
Well, he does bring up
a good point, Jer.

40:05.672 --> 40:07.405
There's a wide spectrum
of moments ranging

40:07.407 --> 40:09.207
from love at first sight
to restraining order.

40:09.209 --> 40:11.676
Which is it?

40:11.678 --> 40:15.213
Hey, only one way
to find out, brother.

40:18.550 --> 40:20.618
Come on, what you gonna do?

40:20.620 --> 40:23.488
I'm going in.

40:23.490 --> 40:25.590
So am I.
Hey!

40:25.592 --> 40:26.858
What's he doing?

40:26.860 --> 40:30.361
Jerry is gonna put the moves
on the good doctor over there.

40:30.363 --> 40:33.064
I don't like it.

40:33.066 --> 40:34.632
Eye of the tiger, Jer.

40:35.969 --> 40:38.970
I think he gets
shot down pretty quickly.

40:38.972 --> 40:40.671
$20 say you're wrong.

40:40.673 --> 40:42.240
All right.

40:42.242 --> 40:44.175
I don't want to bet
against my guy, but okay.

40:44.177 --> 40:46.611
Put me down with ten large.

40:46.613 --> 40:48.279
10,000?

40:48.281 --> 40:51.315
For me-- ten, ten.

40:55.021 --> 40:57.922
Cheers.

40:59.825 --> 41:02.593
Oh, see, now, that
is a bold move.

41:02.595 --> 41:04.562
Do your thing, big sexy.

41:06.499 --> 41:07.565
That man has got game.

41:07.567 --> 41:08.699
And that's why you owe me $20.

41:08.701 --> 41:10.067
Fair enough.

41:10.069 --> 41:11.135
He got game, man.
I'll gladly pay.

41:11.137 --> 41:12.103
Thank you.

41:12.105 --> 41:14.305
Very impressed.

41:16.742 --> 41:18.576
Wait, stop. What are you doing?
Huh?

41:18.578 --> 41:20.378
What are you doing?!
It is Amber. She, uh,

41:20.380 --> 41:21.479
she got the flowers I sent her.

41:21.481 --> 41:24.315
I am not spying
on my daughter, okay?

41:24.317 --> 41:25.516
Listen to me.
You're doing the right thing.

41:25.518 --> 41:26.951
I'm proud of you, all right?

41:26.953 --> 41:28.419
It pains me to say it,
but you were right.

41:28.421 --> 41:29.620
You were right. Um,

41:29.622 --> 41:31.923
she is a good kid and I
just need to trust her.

41:31.925 --> 41:33.424
Not for nothing.

41:33.426 --> 41:36.394
But, uh, it looks like the
romance might be on the rocks.

41:36.396 --> 41:37.762
Go talk to her.

41:37.764 --> 41:39.263
Hold that, will you?

41:42.334 --> 41:43.801
Hey.

41:43.803 --> 41:45.236
You know, you're a lot cuter
when you're smiling.

41:45.238 --> 41:48.539
What's going on?

41:50.742 --> 41:53.444
I have to tell you
something, Danno.

41:53.446 --> 41:55.680
Okay.

41:58.450 --> 42:01.719
I wasn't studying with
my friend yesterday.

42:01.721 --> 42:04.555
I was eating ice cream
with a boy I like.

42:06.458 --> 42:08.326
I lied to you.

42:10.262 --> 42:11.996
It's okay.

42:11.998 --> 42:14.165
I'm glad you told me.

42:14.167 --> 42:15.499
I'm sorry.

42:15.501 --> 42:16.801
I felt terrible lying to you.

42:16.803 --> 42:18.169
Well, look, I'd, uh,

42:18.171 --> 42:21.038
I'd be concerned if you didn't
feel terrible, okay?

42:21.040 --> 42:25.009
And I-I have a confession
to make, too. Um...

42:25.011 --> 42:27.545
I, uh, I could see all your, uh,

42:27.547 --> 42:29.213
text messages.

42:29.215 --> 42:31.549
Something goofy was
going on with that phone.

42:31.551 --> 42:33.884
So I could see, uh,
I could see you were going

42:33.886 --> 42:36.187
to have ice cream with him
and you weren't studying.

42:37.723 --> 42:41.058
Um, and I went there
and I saw you and...

42:41.060 --> 42:42.560
you seemed, uh,

42:42.562 --> 42:44.695
you seemed like you were
having a really good time.

42:44.697 --> 42:46.731
You know, and...

42:46.733 --> 42:49.667
well, Grace, you are
the most important thing to me.

42:49.669 --> 42:51.369
Okay? In the whole world.

42:51.371 --> 42:53.638
So, um, I have to trust you.

42:53.640 --> 42:56.374
You have to trust me.
That's-that's how it'll work.

42:56.376 --> 42:58.442
You understand?
Okay.

42:58.444 --> 43:00.011
All right?

43:00.013 --> 43:01.345
Sorry, Danno.

43:01.347 --> 43:02.813
I love you.

43:02.815 --> 43:04.382
I love you, too, monkey.

43:04.384 --> 43:07.051
Come on, give me some room.

43:07.053 --> 43:09.253
Hey.

43:14.660 --> 43:16.293
Why don't you hurry up
and get rich,

43:16.295 --> 43:18.629
and buy me one of these
nice houses, huh?

43:18.631 --> 43:19.864
I'm trying.

43:19.866 --> 43:21.132
You're trying?
That's good.

43:21.134 --> 43:23.968
Try harder maybe.
