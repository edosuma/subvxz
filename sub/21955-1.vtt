01:25.711 --> 01:30.340
ESCAPE PLAN

01:32.467 --> 01:33.467
Luka.

01:35.012 --> 01:36.012
<i>Dam“ .</i>

01:36.263 --> 01:37.264
And Nikolay.

01:37.848 --> 01:40.142
Nikolay is Russian,
the other two are Serbs.

01:41.059 --> 01:43.103
<i>Dam“ means Peacemaker.</i>

01:44.313 --> 01:46.398
And the guy takes that
very seriously, he's killed

01:46.565 --> 01:48.817
an estimated 50 civilians
in the Yugoslavian war.

01:49.776 --> 01:50.776
Prostitution.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.271
It's difficult to catch them.

01:52.362 --> 01:54.573
They can't be charged
for sex with a minor or coercion.

01:54.740 --> 01:55.490
Guns.

01:55.657 --> 01:56.325
That's how they met,

01:56.491 --> 01:58.411
when the Russians helped them out
in the Balkans.

01:58.577 --> 02:00.912
They still have contacts
but don't sell to third parties.

02:01.455 --> 02:02.623
They don't push drugs either.

02:03.165 --> 02:05.125
So, that just leaves us with...

02:05.292 --> 02:06.292
robberies.

02:06.335 --> 02:07.336
Their main source

02:07.502 --> 02:09.838
of income and investment
for the rest of their businesses.

02:11.798 --> 02:14.843
The Russian is the boss
and in charge of money laundering.

02:15.385 --> 02:16.385
How does he do it?

02:17.846 --> 02:19.681
With a complex network of business,

02:19.848 --> 02:23.060
which I don't feel like explaining.
All you need to do is watch his car.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.166
Don't be in such a hurry
for promotion.

02:29.775 --> 02:30.901
Kolia Bolkov.

02:31.943 --> 02:32.943
Are you coming in?

02:33.820 --> 02:34.820
Sorry.

02:38.408 --> 02:39.408
Who is Kolia?

02:40.327 --> 02:41.411
Somebody close the door.

02:47.334 --> 02:48.334
No one.

02:49.419 --> 02:51.546
He died of a heart attack
a year and a half ago.

02:52.673 --> 02:53.673
Who was he?

02:53.965 --> 02:55.425
A good thief.

02:56.259 --> 02:57.719
We thought they wouldn't need him.

02:58.095 --> 02:59.947
They've invested a lot
in their illegal dealings,

02:59.971 --> 03:02.599
especially construction,
which has been going well for them.

03:03.600 --> 03:06.687
But they are going back to stealing.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.588
They need to put together a plan...

03:10.524 --> 03:13.944
and a new team. They need a driver
who knows the city well,

03:14.111 --> 03:16.154
a meeting place and a target.

03:16.405 --> 03:18.490
But more than anything...

03:19.282 --> 03:22.369
They need to replace this guy.

03:44.474 --> 03:45.474
Do you want a beer?

03:45.892 --> 03:46.892
Yeah.

03:46.935 --> 03:47.935
No.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.738
Did you do this
with a remote detonator?

03:57.904 --> 03:59.823
I wanted to blow the wall out,

04:00.407 --> 04:03.410
but someone gave me a dud explosive
and I had no choice.

04:06.163 --> 04:07.163
Who are you?

04:10.041 --> 04:11.418
We know nothing about you.

04:11.918 --> 04:12.918
Nobody knows you.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.361
Maybe we don't have
the same friends.

04:18.425 --> 04:19.509
Not likely.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.287
Everybody wants to get in with us.

04:22.804 --> 04:23.805
Have you been to prison?

04:24.139 --> 04:25.139
Never.

04:25.682 --> 04:27.142
Are you that good or just lucky?

04:27.976 --> 04:29.519
I like to think it's a bit of both.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.067
Use energy-efficient bulbs...

04:36.443 --> 04:37.194
So, tell me.

04:37.360 --> 04:40.322
If you're so good, what
are you doing working with amateurs?

04:42.449 --> 04:44.159
I needed the money
and it was risk-free.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.995
Anyway,
I'm with professionals now, right?

04:47.579 --> 04:48.579
Are you now?

04:50.540 --> 04:51.740
And what do you know about me?

04:52.501 --> 04:53.919
That if you robbed pharmacies,

04:54.085 --> 04:56.296
you'd use a penknife
not a Gerber Applegate.

04:58.799 --> 04:59.966
Army, right?

05:01.718 --> 05:03.220
Peacekeeping Forces.

05:04.012 --> 05:06.723
Where? Africa? The Middle East?

05:07.933 --> 05:08.933
Mostar.

05:16.233 --> 05:18.068
OK, what else?

05:19.486 --> 05:20.570
That's all.

05:24.783 --> 05:26.117
Thanks for the beer.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.038
The Chinaman.

05:32.791 --> 05:34.584
We worked at a jewellers together.

05:35.544 --> 05:37.712
Good bloke.
He got eight years...

05:38.338 --> 05:39.422
was out in two.

05:40.966 --> 05:41.966
Gero.

05:43.009 --> 05:44.009
The Veteran?

05:47.222 --> 05:48.807
OK, let's go.

05:50.934 --> 05:51.934
Where?

05:52.769 --> 05:53.769
To a party-

06:33.643 --> 06:34.643
Come on.

06:44.112 --> 06:46.031
I thought Gero was retired.

06:46.615 --> 06:47.615
He is.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.618
We worked together a long time ago.

06:50.285 --> 06:53.371
You're young.
You must have something more recent.

06:53.997 --> 06:55.081
I don't know you.

06:55.707 --> 06:57.584
I've got the same problem.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.252
True.

07:00.670 --> 07:01.670
Take care.

07:01.713 --> 07:02.713
What did you say?

07:03.256 --> 07:05.884
I don't know you
and you don't trust me.

07:06.343 --> 07:09.095
We could keep this up for days
but I have better things to do.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.639
And I assume you do to.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.307
As I said, take care.

07:16.061 --> 07:18.063
Don't turn your back on me.

07:29.074 --> 07:30.158
It's a clean job

07:31.618 --> 07:32.786
with no complications.

07:32.953 --> 07:35.664
We'll be in and out
and I'll pay you for your trouble.

07:36.122 --> 07:36.873
What do we have to do?

07:37.040 --> 07:39.209
Drill through a meter of concrete,
could you do that?

07:39.876 --> 07:40.876
I could.

07:42.504 --> 07:43.504
Good.

07:44.631 --> 07:45.631
What now?

07:45.882 --> 07:47.133
Now, you have some fun.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.043
Hi.

09:09.883 --> 09:10.883
Hi.

09:11.593 --> 09:12.886
Don't you remember me?

09:16.598 --> 09:18.433
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

09:21.102 --> 09:22.102
What do you want?

09:22.604 --> 09:23.730
What do you think?

09:25.482 --> 09:26.602
Do you know what time it is?

09:27.484 --> 09:29.611
I know that men never knock me back.

09:30.528 --> 09:31.528
Never?

09:33.782 --> 09:35.784
Well, get ready
to be disappointed, darling.

09:49.589 --> 09:50.589
It's him.

10:17.659 --> 10:18.659
We're outside.

10:24.332 --> 10:25.583
<i>I repeat, we're outside.</i>

10:26.960 --> 10:27.960
OK.

10:29.045 --> 10:30.255
<i>Do you copy, sir?</i>

10:31.798 --> 10:33.800
I've got no signal.
Talk to dispatch.

10:55.446 --> 10:56.446
Homicide?

10:58.158 --> 10:59.158
CID.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.492
CID?

11:02.120 --> 11:03.120
May I?

11:03.746 --> 11:04.746
Of course.

11:12.964 --> 11:14.757
He was dragged here by the current.

11:15.133 --> 11:17.302
They're expanding
this overflow channel

11:17.468 --> 11:18.720
and he's the explosives expert.

11:19.304 --> 11:21.304
The one in charge
of demolition and transporting...

11:21.431 --> 11:22.557
The explosives.

11:37.447 --> 11:38.447
Problem?

11:39.449 --> 11:40.449
Nope.

11:41.367 --> 11:43.077
What about you?

11:44.370 --> 11:45.370
A lot.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.219
Are you referring
to any one in particular?

11:48.791 --> 11:49.791
Are you queer?

11:51.336 --> 11:54.172
I ask because I could send you
a bloke instead of a woman.

11:55.506 --> 11:56.946
How about
you don't send me anything?

11:57.258 --> 11:59.344
Well, you'd be refusing a gift...

11:59.802 --> 12:01.221
And that would be a problem.

12:25.203 --> 12:26.203
Get up.

12:29.457 --> 12:30.750
What the fuck is this?

12:31.584 --> 12:33.253
What you signed up for, a job.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.129
I was expecting a meeting.

12:36.297 --> 12:37.465
And you'll get one...

12:38.591 --> 12:39.591
Inside.

12:42.637 --> 12:43.637
They're splitting up.

12:44.472 --> 12:46.057
We're following the van.

12:54.023 --> 12:55.023
Where are we going?

12:55.191 --> 12:56.693
An office building.

12:56.943 --> 12:58.319
There's a safe in the basement.

12:58.486 --> 12:59.320
Surveillance?

12:59.487 --> 13:00.780
Two security guards.

13:00.947 --> 13:01.990
How do we avoid them?

13:02.490 --> 13:03.574
By not getting out.

13:03.866 --> 13:04.951
You've got to be joking.

13:05.576 --> 13:06.619
Have you got any idea

13:06.786 --> 13:08.626
how much heat
and smoke a burning bar produces?

13:08.746 --> 13:10.290
You can't use it inside a container.

13:10.456 --> 13:11.749
Everything you need is there.

13:15.670 --> 13:17.130
Fire proximity entry suits

13:17.380 --> 13:19.340
used for factory fires.

13:19.757 --> 13:21.009
We'll measure the temperature

13:21.175 --> 13:22.176
in and outside the suit.

13:22.510 --> 13:23.511
And if it doesn't work?

13:24.178 --> 13:25.346
We'll open the door.

13:56.919 --> 13:57.919
Where are they?

13:58.629 --> 13:59.629
Inside a container.

14:00.006 --> 14:00.673
What?

14:00.840 --> 14:01.840
<i>Torre Norte.</i>

14:03.009 --> 14:04.010
We'll be there in 20.

14:11.434 --> 14:12.935
Where the hell can I get signal?

14:25.490 --> 14:26.490
Temperature?

14:27.450 --> 14:29.619
60 outside.
30 inside the suit.

14:29.786 --> 14:30.786
30 degrees?

14:31.204 --> 14:32.622
Calm down, everything's fine.

14:44.801 --> 14:45.968
<i>Is anyone there?</i>

14:47.595 --> 14:48.595
Yes, sir.

14:48.679 --> 14:49.679
We're leaving.

14:49.764 --> 14:50.890
<i>Can you repeat that, sir?</i>

14:51.224 --> 14:54.519
We're leaving, I can't arrest anyone
for stealing in their own home.

15:11.661 --> 15:12.661
Temperature?

15:13.079 --> 15:15.289
67 outside, 34 inside.

15:18.251 --> 15:18.918
Hang on,

15:19.085 --> 15:21.629
where is the fucking thermometer?
In your suit or mine?

16:20.062 --> 16:21.189
In the nick of time.

16:38.956 --> 16:39.956
What's this?

16:40.541 --> 16:41.709
What we said.

16:42.543 --> 16:45.254
A risk-free robbery, a safe...
You've done well.

16:54.764 --> 16:55.848
I don't work like this.

16:56.682 --> 16:57.682
<i>Not enough'?</i>

16:57.767 --> 17:00.204
I'm not talking about the money.
I want to know what it is I'm doing.

17:00.228 --> 17:01.604
Being welcomed into my house...

17:01.812 --> 17:02.939
and my family.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.776
I'm giving you
the opportunity to come with us.

17:07.193 --> 17:08.193
Where?

17:09.529 --> 17:10.988
The Swiss Credit Bank.

17:11.364 --> 17:12.531
30 million.

17:12.949 --> 17:15.344
One day of work, and the rest
of your life to reap the benefits...

17:15.367 --> 17:17.328
All you have to do is
what you did here, today.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.039
A bank isn't
the same as an office building.

17:20.205 --> 17:21.205
True.

17:21.374 --> 17:22.791
You'll have to do it better.

17:34.804 --> 17:35.930
Grab the equipment.

17:37.807 --> 17:38.807
We're leaving.

18:10.339 --> 18:11.924
I forgot about this.

18:23.144 --> 18:24.604
Take what you want from the fridge.

18:24.979 --> 18:26.814
There's beer and maybe some juice.

18:55.801 --> 18:56.801
Have a seat.

19:07.855 --> 19:10.316
Listen, I don't know
how many times I'll be back here,

19:11.067 --> 19:12.987
so why don't we just make
this easy on ourselves?

19:14.070 --> 19:15.070
Sure.

19:15.946 --> 19:17.186
What do you want to talk about?

19:17.406 --> 19:18.449
You choose.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.242
Let's talk about you.

19:21.702 --> 19:22.703
Thanks.

19:23.788 --> 19:24.788
Can I smoke?

19:25.039 --> 19:26.039
No.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.049
What do you want to know?

19:35.341 --> 19:38.594
Whatever comes
into your head first...

19:39.011 --> 19:40.054
I want to get to know you.

19:45.351 --> 19:46.977
My father was a carpenter.

19:47.978 --> 19:49.355
He had a workshop in Italy.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.440
He made me out of wood.

19:51.649 --> 19:53.818
He loved me but he didn't know
how to give me a heart.

19:53.984 --> 19:55.184
He attached some strings here,

19:55.277 --> 19:57.988
- so I could move like this...
- What the hell is your problem?

19:59.740 --> 20:02.868
My problem is that I'm tired
because I've had a hard day.

20:03.411 --> 20:05.830
And I'm not talking to you,
I'm talking to your friends.

20:06.288 --> 20:08.874
I don't mean to be disrespectful
because they're my family now,

20:10.418 --> 20:11.627
but this is my home.

20:12.169 --> 20:14.930
If they want to know what's hiding
in my closet they should come over,

20:15.339 --> 20:16.339
not you.

20:17.967 --> 20:19.385
I'm sure you'd like that.

20:27.643 --> 20:28.643
Where am I sleeping?

20:32.231 --> 20:33.315
On the sofa.

21:13.189 --> 21:15.470
- Who are all these people?
- Financial Intelligence Unit.

21:15.608 --> 21:18.336
It's believed the developer has been
fiddling the numbers for a while now

21:18.360 --> 21:19.840
and that they're technically
bankrupt.

21:19.945 --> 21:22.865
They had an inspection scheduled
for this week...

21:25.951 --> 21:27.951
But they won't be able to hand over
their accounts.

21:37.421 --> 21:40.132
Do we really have to open
an investigation into all of this?

21:41.842 --> 21:42.842
It's theft.

21:43.385 --> 21:45.179
If we don't do it,
they'll start missing us.

21:52.269 --> 21:53.269
Come in.

21:56.565 --> 21:58.901
- Please, have a seat.
- Thank you.

22:01.737 --> 22:03.239
I hope this won't take long,

22:03.405 --> 22:04.405
I've been answering

22:04.448 --> 22:06.492
your colleagues' questions
all morning.

22:07.910 --> 22:08.910
May I?

22:10.371 --> 22:11.497
Your IDs.

22:11.664 --> 22:12.664
Of course.

22:16.669 --> 22:17.669
May I?

22:21.632 --> 22:23.592
- Solicitor.
- Legal and tax advisor.

22:23.843 --> 22:26.428
Our clients have
their own team of solicitors.

22:26.637 --> 22:27.637
What's happened?

22:28.055 --> 22:30.307
Our security guards
discovered a fire.

22:30.474 --> 22:31.559
They put it out...

22:31.809 --> 22:33.561
Then we realised
someone had been inside.

22:33.769 --> 22:34.812
Do you have CCTV?

22:36.188 --> 22:37.189
They already asked that.

22:37.481 --> 22:39.161
Part of the building
is under construction.

22:39.483 --> 22:41.523
The security systems
are the last to be installed...

22:41.986 --> 22:42.611
Sorry.

22:42.820 --> 22:44.613
Was there anything of value
in the basement?

22:44.822 --> 22:45.822
Payments? Bonds?

22:45.948 --> 22:47.408
No, just paperwork.

22:47.575 --> 22:48.655
The head of security thinks

22:48.784 --> 22:50.578
that they tried to find
something valuable

22:50.953 --> 22:52.830
after they opened the safe.

22:52.997 --> 22:54.117
They didn't find anything...

22:54.456 --> 22:55.776
so they removed all their traces.

22:56.709 --> 22:57.709
It's possible.

22:58.919 --> 22:59.920
Thank you for your time.

23:00.087 --> 23:01.213
Whatever you need.

23:13.559 --> 23:15.352
It looks like
we have some friends in common.

23:15.853 --> 23:16.979
Mr. Korovin.

23:17.605 --> 23:18.606
Mr. Korovin.

23:19.607 --> 23:20.399
Does he work here?

23:20.566 --> 23:21.901
He's one of our investors.

23:22.067 --> 23:23.067
An important one?

23:23.319 --> 23:24.069
They all are.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.655
Majority, minority,
board of directors...

23:26.989 --> 23:27.989
Errand boy?

23:28.282 --> 23:31.368
All I can say is that, until now,
his behaviour has been impeccable.

23:31.911 --> 23:33.662
Good luck with that.

23:34.580 --> 23:37.333
I can assure you that if Mr. Korovin
makes a loss on his investment,

23:38.208 --> 23:39.418
his behaviour will be anything

23:39.585 --> 23:40.628
but impeccable.

23:42.004 --> 23:43.005
Thank you, again.

23:46.216 --> 23:47.885
<i>Swiss Credit Bank.</i>

23:48.052 --> 23:50.429
It has one main office
and no branches.

23:50.930 --> 23:51.930
CUSTOMER ACCESS

23:52.056 --> 23:53.057
OFFICES

23:53.223 --> 23:53.849
ENTRANCE
VAN

23:54.016 --> 23:55.100
Two entrances...

23:55.309 --> 23:56.143
One for deliveries,

23:56.310 --> 23:57.895
the other for staff and customers.

23:58.145 --> 23:59.355
Not very popular.

23:59.605 --> 24:02.858
There is a small number of accounts,
but substantial account activity.

24:04.026 --> 24:06.111
At least 20 million in cash

24:06.445 --> 24:09.156
and another ten in bonds,
maybe more.

24:09.740 --> 24:10.908
And it's all...

24:11.492 --> 24:12.201
here.

24:12.451 --> 24:15.371
The Bank Manager and financial
controller both have a set of keys.

24:16.288 --> 24:18.415
Twenty-minute delayed opening.

24:18.582 --> 24:19.583
A Kolman-Graff.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.086
Have you worked
with something like this?

24:22.252 --> 24:24.046
I don't open safes, I drill metal.

24:24.421 --> 24:26.590
I don't need to know the model,
I need time...

24:26.799 --> 24:28.008
and a place to work.

24:29.093 --> 24:30.093
Where would that be?

24:30.135 --> 24:31.261
A blind spot.

24:32.262 --> 24:35.140
40 square meters,
no bigger than a container,

24:35.641 --> 24:37.226
out of range of the alarms.

24:37.559 --> 24:39.728
A structural fault
they're not aware of.

24:44.149 --> 24:45.149
Your blind spot,

24:45.901 --> 24:46.901
wherever that is,

24:47.653 --> 24:49.196
doesn't have alarms. Good...

24:50.114 --> 24:51.323
but the vault does.

24:51.949 --> 24:53.993
Motion and vibration sensors,
heat sensors...

24:54.159 --> 24:55.285
We can disable them.

24:57.496 --> 24:58.122
HOW?

24:58.288 --> 25:00.791
Leave that to us. Can you do it?

25:03.961 --> 25:04.961
I don't know.

25:08.173 --> 25:10.634
We've pushed the equipment
to the limit on an easier job.

25:12.052 --> 25:14.179
The ceiling of the vault
won't come off.

25:14.346 --> 25:16.098
It doesn't have beams,
they're steel plates.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.149
The temperature is going to rise
considerably.

25:21.437 --> 25:23.647
- We might have to give up.
- That's not possible.

25:23.814 --> 25:24.440
Why?

25:24.606 --> 25:25.941
This isn't a container,

25:26.275 --> 25:27.609
there won't be a door to open...

25:31.447 --> 25:32.573
We have to stop.

25:50.299 --> 25:52.843
He's a good driver,
we've worked together before.

25:53.677 --> 25:55.846
The driver isn't what's worrying me,
it's the plan.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.348
Look, I'm not going back to working
blind.

25:58.557 --> 25:59.850
Either you trust me or I'm gone.

26:00.059 --> 26:01.059
I already told you.

26:01.143 --> 26:04.104
This isn't a job,
it's becoming part of the family.

26:18.869 --> 26:19.869
Hi, Gero.

26:32.174 --> 26:34.510
Isn't it a bit cold to be out here?

26:35.385 --> 26:37.763
If my prostate shrinks,
I can actually manage to piss.

26:38.597 --> 26:39.637
That's supposed to be bad.

26:40.599 --> 26:41.642
It's good for me.

26:43.227 --> 26:44.227
What do you want?

26:44.561 --> 26:45.561
The cold.

26:47.147 --> 26:48.273
I need to use a burning bar

26:48.440 --> 26:50.484
inside a small space
for a long period of time.

26:51.026 --> 26:52.569
The temperature gets too high.

26:55.447 --> 26:56.698
The Russian called.

26:57.533 --> 26:58.909
He wanted to talk about you.

27:04.790 --> 27:06.708
I told him
we worked together a long time ago.

27:06.917 --> 27:07.917
That's all.

27:09.253 --> 27:10.546
I don't like those people.

27:11.797 --> 27:13.557
I don't like
being involved with them either.

27:13.799 --> 27:15.319
I'm out of all that.
That was the deal.

27:17.427 --> 27:18.427
I know.

27:18.929 --> 27:19.972
It won't happen again.

27:20.681 --> 27:22.683
No, it won't.

27:22.933 --> 27:24.393
Come on, Gero, man.

27:24.560 --> 27:25.644
We're mates, aren't we?

27:25.811 --> 27:28.371
You know I wouldn't do anything
that would put you in harm's way.

27:28.605 --> 27:30.325
Anyway,
I only told him the truth, didn't I?

27:30.816 --> 27:31.817
It's no big deal.

27:32.109 --> 27:33.610
Is your word no big deal?

27:44.079 --> 27:44.913
Take these.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.832
They're chocolate orange,
I don't like them.

27:50.502 --> 27:53.380
I once used liquid oxygen.

27:54.756 --> 27:56.484
It was because of space
restrictions, not heat.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.188
I needed the tools
to get into a briefcase.

27:59.219 --> 28:02.347
It's much smaller
and works at minus 200 degrees.

28:03.348 --> 28:05.017
I used a wire-mesh hose,

28:06.226 --> 28:08.228
like the cooling system...

28:08.854 --> 28:10.564
on a fridge.

28:12.441 --> 28:13.609
It was a short job.

28:15.402 --> 28:16.945
You should see if that would work.

28:26.705 --> 28:27.748
Don't come back.

28:45.515 --> 28:46.515
Are you moving?

28:46.558 --> 28:48.227
They're clean clothes,
I've been at work.

28:48.518 --> 28:50.038
I want to brush my teeth
in the morning.

28:50.062 --> 28:52.564
Your towels and shampoo are shit
and there's no dryer.

28:53.899 --> 28:54.899
Have you eaten?

29:12.918 --> 29:14.503
I met my best friend
when we were kids.

29:15.212 --> 29:17.412
He was older than me
and he taught me everything I know.

29:18.006 --> 29:18.674
I loved him.

29:18.882 --> 29:19.882
He was...

29:20.175 --> 29:21.175
decent

29:23.345 --> 29:25.681
We never inflicted damage
out of pleasure. Never.

29:26.265 --> 29:27.891
We just wanted to have fun.

29:29.059 --> 29:30.644
We liked...

29:31.061 --> 29:34.690
girls, cars, most drugs...

29:35.816 --> 29:36.816
and stealing.

29:38.568 --> 29:40.488
And we were good, you know.
They never caught us.

29:41.571 --> 29:43.573
I suppose
that was why we were so reckless.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.578
One night it was really hot

29:48.745 --> 29:50.664
and we were driving along the coast.

29:51.748 --> 29:52.748
He goes to me:

29:53.542 --> 29:54.710
"Why don't we go for a swim?"

29:59.423 --> 30:00.882
We should have ditched the car.

30:02.134 --> 30:05.095
We should have taken all
of the jewellery out of the boot...

30:06.680 --> 30:08.974
or at least not have parked
on the pavement.

30:12.436 --> 30:15.897
I was in the water
and my mate was lying on the sand.

30:18.483 --> 30:20.277
When I saw the police coming...

30:22.738 --> 30:23.947
I just swam...

30:26.700 --> 30:28.160
and swam and swam.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.585
I visited him in prison
loads of times.

30:38.295 --> 30:39.087
At least at first.

30:39.296 --> 30:42.096
Then I started leaving more and more
time between visits. I couldn't...

30:42.466 --> 30:44.718
I couldn't stand seeing
how it was destroying him.

30:49.097 --> 30:50.849
I decided
that couldn't happen to me.

30:52.351 --> 30:53.351
I decided to change.

30:54.478 --> 30:55.645
It's not about fun anymore,

30:56.146 --> 30:57.272
just making a living.

30:59.941 --> 31:02.569
I don't make mistakes,
I don't have accomplices.

31:03.904 --> 31:05.405
I work alone as much as possible,

31:05.614 --> 31:09.284
and if I can't, I try to work
with someone who'll forget about me.

31:11.912 --> 31:13.592
That's why your boss
doesn't know who I am.

31:13.955 --> 31:14.955
What's that?

31:15.123 --> 31:16.958
Adoption papers.

31:18.085 --> 31:20.605
You can find out where I stole them
from with the serial number.

31:21.004 --> 31:23.507
I hope it's enough
to get them off my back.

31:24.216 --> 31:26.968
I'll sleep more soundly and you
won't do your back in on the sofa.

31:29.137 --> 31:30.305
Why do I bother you so much?

31:30.889 --> 31:31.889
It's nothing personal.

31:32.057 --> 31:33.058
It is to me.

31:34.768 --> 31:36.770
You don't bother me, I like you.

31:39.981 --> 31:42.461
Another reason for you to get
out of here, as soon as possible.

32:18.770 --> 32:19.896
Don't worry, go on.

32:30.532 --> 32:31.532
It doesn't matter.

32:54.097 --> 32:55.097
Is he ok?

32:55.932 --> 32:56.932
Yes.

32:57.142 --> 32:58.518
Can you bring some nappies up?

33:18.121 --> 33:19.121
Babe!

33:20.248 --> 33:21.608
Can you tell me where you keep...?

33:23.752 --> 33:24.752
I can't find them.

33:30.467 --> 33:31.468
I have to go.

33:33.303 --> 33:34.554
Of course you do.

33:40.268 --> 33:41.268
What do you want?

33:41.937 --> 33:43.104
Tell me what you want.

33:44.648 --> 33:45.941
To know that you're sorry.

33:46.608 --> 33:48.928
That you'd prefer to stay here
with me, instead of leaving.

33:49.069 --> 33:50.129
To hear one word of apology

33:50.153 --> 33:51.593
for everything
I have to put up with.

33:51.696 --> 33:53.299
Is that what you want?
For me to say sorry?

33:53.323 --> 33:55.242
No... Not just that,

33:55.992 --> 33:57.911
but it would be nice
to hear it for once.

33:59.454 --> 34:00.997
I need you close.

34:01.498 --> 34:02.498
Christ...

34:05.669 --> 34:06.749
I'm doing everything I can.

34:07.128 --> 34:08.964
You do just enough so I don't leave.

34:09.505 --> 34:10.505
That's cruel.

34:14.094 --> 34:14.719
He can wait.

34:14.886 --> 34:17.429
And we can have this conversation
another time, don't you think?

34:20.058 --> 34:21.058
Do you love me?

34:25.480 --> 34:26.666
Do you have to think about it?

34:26.690 --> 34:28.000
No, I don't have to think about it

34:28.024 --> 34:29.609
or fall into the trap
you're setting me,

34:29.775 --> 34:32.612
because you knew exactly what it is
I do when you met me, didn't you?

34:33.237 --> 34:34.572
Why did you have a child with me?

34:36.449 --> 34:38.768
I think that particular marriage
counselling was your idea.

34:39.619 --> 34:40.619
You see?

34:41.580 --> 34:42.621
You're cruel.

34:42.956 --> 34:44.165
And immature.

34:47.418 --> 34:48.420
And a dick.

35:26.750 --> 35:27.750
Good.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.086
Now it's your turn to ask.

35:40.055 --> 35:41.055
Jesus!

35:41.181 --> 35:43.099
What is it, Luke?
Do I look like your dad?

35:46.186 --> 35:47.186
How's it going on?

35:47.771 --> 35:48.521
You're the new guy,

35:48.688 --> 35:49.688
aren't you?

35:50.649 --> 35:51.650
How's it going, mate?

35:54.653 --> 35:55.653
Fine...,

35:56.321 --> 35:57.321
mate.

36:06.873 --> 36:08.124
Everything looks good.

36:08.917 --> 36:11.044
It doesn't. You're here.

36:11.920 --> 36:13.088
I just want to help.

36:13.797 --> 36:14.506
I think I know who killed

36:14.673 --> 36:16.153
the explosives expert
from the tunnel.

36:30.021 --> 36:32.357
We've been waiting. Where were you?

36:32.607 --> 36:35.318
Puking, pal, it's just...
I don't feel well.

36:35.694 --> 36:38.530
Sit down. We'll discuss
your business then you can go.

36:38.738 --> 36:40.365
I don't think you understand.

36:41.991 --> 36:44.744
I don't feel well.
I've been like this for days, now.

36:54.921 --> 36:56.161
You guys know I'm always there,

36:56.256 --> 36:57.841
I've never let you down.
I've never...

36:59.676 --> 37:00.885
abandoned you.

37:02.512 --> 37:04.013
What are you talking about?

37:06.099 --> 37:07.099
Quitting.

37:10.228 --> 37:11.229
I'm in bad shape.

37:12.814 --> 37:14.274
I'm totally fucked.

37:14.816 --> 37:16.526
It's my health, my fucking health.

37:20.280 --> 37:21.280
I'm really sorry.

37:22.365 --> 37:23.365
Shit.

37:27.162 --> 37:28.538
Shut your fucking dog up.

37:38.965 --> 37:40.925
Do you want to repeat that,

37:41.760 --> 37:43.303
you fucking junkie.

37:49.017 --> 37:50.059
Are you listening?

37:52.771 --> 37:54.689
- There's someone outside.
- What?

38:46.366 --> 38:47.075
<i>Police!</i>

38:47.242 --> 38:49.285
<i>Put the gun down
and come outwith your hands up!</i>

39:25.029 --> 39:26.197
Bloody come on!

39:33.997 --> 39:34.997
What are you doing?

39:35.039 --> 39:36.039
Run!

39:46.759 --> 39:48.359
<i>Put the guns down
and hands on your head.</i>

39:48.928 --> 39:50.096
<i>Put the gun down!</i>

40:44.943 --> 40:45.943
Who are you?

40:46.945 --> 40:47.945
Who are you?

40:48.071 --> 40:49.197
I haven't seen any ID.

40:49.656 --> 40:51.074
We're going to be friends.

40:51.950 --> 40:53.952
Do you think
you're in a local police station?

40:56.037 --> 40:57.037
Interpol.

40:58.331 --> 40:59.958
Fuck with me and I'll destroy you.

41:03.628 --> 41:05.338
Why don't I have any info on you?

41:05.672 --> 41:07.215
They tell me that a lot.

41:11.511 --> 41:12.553
I want a solicitor.

41:13.137 --> 41:14.472
And I want answers.

41:15.556 --> 41:16.724
We weren't looking for you,

41:17.225 --> 41:18.452
nor do we know what you were doing

41:18.476 --> 41:19.916
with those people,
but you will talk.

41:20.103 --> 41:21.354
It's just a question of time.

41:22.981 --> 41:24.341
Why don't you make it easy for me?

41:26.025 --> 41:27.235
I'd rather wait.

41:36.786 --> 41:37.786
Who are you?

41:44.335 --> 41:45.335
Release him.

42:29.213 --> 42:31.674
One of them was wanted
for war crimes.

42:32.717 --> 42:36.262
Interpol put out an international
arrest warrant a week ago.

42:37.847 --> 42:39.640
None of the agencies
shared the info.

42:39.807 --> 42:42.769
They didn't know about our operation
and we didn't know about theirs.

42:47.648 --> 42:48.648
Sorry.

42:50.234 --> 42:51.234
I owe you one.

42:52.403 --> 42:53.843
Is there anything else
I should know?

42:55.239 --> 42:56.574
Internal affairs.

42:58.785 --> 42:59.869
You're joking, aren't you?

43:29.774 --> 43:30.900
I know it's bad

43:31.818 --> 43:34.320
and you're not supposed to smoke
anywhere in the building.

43:35.822 --> 43:37.240
But I'm not hurting anyone.

43:39.033 --> 43:40.033
Do you know him?

43:41.786 --> 43:43.263
Did you know he was
an explosives expert

43:43.287 --> 43:45.414
- and he was supplying the Russian?
- Yes.

43:45.706 --> 43:47.059
Did you swap the bombs
at the fur shop

43:47.083 --> 43:48.584
- so they wouldn't work?
- Yes.

43:48.876 --> 43:50.336
Did you know this bloke gave them

43:50.503 --> 43:52.303
a shipment of fault explosives
six months ago?

43:52.547 --> 43:54.267
I thought that would make it
more plausible.

43:57.426 --> 43:58.469
This plausible?

44:02.473 --> 44:04.142
- I needed to get their attention.
- Why?

44:04.308 --> 44:06.602
Because the alibi you gave me
was bullshit, that's why!

44:14.193 --> 44:14.944
The only contact I had

44:15.111 --> 44:17.191
was an old partner who goes
by the name The Chinaman,

44:17.321 --> 44:19.841
but it wasn't working because
everyone knows he was an informer.

44:19.949 --> 44:22.326
That and using a criminal,
Geronimo Garcia,

44:22.827 --> 44:23.953
Gero, The Veteran...,

44:24.245 --> 44:25.705
without notifying the department.

44:25.913 --> 44:27.331
He didn't cause any problems.

44:27.665 --> 44:28.833
What a relief.

44:30.918 --> 44:31.669
Fill in this form

44:31.836 --> 44:34.213
and request the return
of a Breguet Tourbillén watch

44:34.380 --> 44:35.980
that went missing
from the evidence room.

44:37.884 --> 44:39.635
Look, I've done the best I can.

44:39.802 --> 44:41.482
I'll be discussing that
with your superior.

44:41.846 --> 44:42.847
And until then?

44:43.723 --> 44:45.099
Finish the report and go home.

44:56.152 --> 44:56.986
Another round.

44:57.153 --> 44:58.153
No, no, no.

44:58.487 --> 45:00.323
- Last one.
- No.

45:10.917 --> 45:12.543
Is there anything
I can do for my friend?

45:16.047 --> 45:17.548
Tell him to turn himself in.

45:18.966 --> 45:20.301
We made a deal.

45:23.179 --> 45:24.931
With us, not Interpol.

45:31.771 --> 45:32.771
Help me out.

45:34.607 --> 45:35.607
I can't.

45:44.617 --> 45:46.619
Get some rest, you need it.

45:48.621 --> 45:50.373
Get some rest... Oi! No!

45:50.581 --> 45:51.749
One more, come on.

45:52.124 --> 45:53.125
Last one.

45:55.795 --> 45:57.272
You've been saying that
for two hours.

45:57.296 --> 45:58.376
My wife's going to kill me.

45:59.423 --> 46:01.259
You're preaching to the choir.

46:03.302 --> 46:03.970
Cheers.

46:04.220 --> 46:05.220
Cheers.

46:43.092 --> 46:44.092
Whose is this?

46:45.136 --> 46:47.888
I'm in bad shape
but I'm not completely destitute.

46:49.807 --> 46:50.558
You want a beer?

46:50.766 --> 46:51.766
No way.

46:53.311 --> 46:54.520
You on a binge?

46:57.398 --> 46:58.398
Sit down.

47:07.533 --> 47:08.533
How's it going?

47:09.285 --> 47:10.285
Good.

47:11.662 --> 47:12.955
I heard you'd had a kid.

47:14.623 --> 47:15.623
That's good.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
Kids bring you...

47:17.960 --> 47:20.421
stability and they...
You know what I mean?

47:20.755 --> 47:23.090
I try, I really do, but it's
this thing that lets me down.

47:23.257 --> 47:24.257
My fucking head.

47:25.301 --> 47:27.362
I thought about quitting.
I thought about doing this job

47:27.386 --> 47:28.386
and then disappearing.

47:28.471 --> 47:29.740
Setting up a business and living

47:29.764 --> 47:31.284
the quiet life
for the rest of my days.

47:31.390 --> 47:33.030
I had...
I had the investment money, mate.

47:34.894 --> 47:36.054
This is me you're talking to.

47:40.358 --> 47:41.400
Get me out of this.

47:42.234 --> 47:43.234
HOW?

47:45.738 --> 47:47.782
I can't go back to prison.

47:50.785 --> 47:52.495
Going through that again
would kill me.

47:55.873 --> 47:56.873
Give me something.

47:57.917 --> 47:58.917
Like what?

47:59.919 --> 48:02.039
I don't know. Something
I can put in front of a judge.

48:06.467 --> 48:08.344
I've worked with the Russians
three times.

48:13.849 --> 48:15.810
A right group of bastards.

48:16.394 --> 48:19.105
I can give a judge any information
he wants, I don't give a shit.

48:19.271 --> 48:21.124
Only one of them was Russian
and they're all dead.

48:21.148 --> 48:22.268
Look, this isn't worth shit.

48:23.067 --> 48:24.378
Neither is the dealer who gives you

48:24.402 --> 48:25.962
all this or the guy
who robbed a bakery.

48:26.028 --> 48:28.322
Have you got anything worth taking
to a judge? Yes or no?

48:30.950 --> 48:32.743
We were friends.
Is that worth anything?

48:34.870 --> 48:36.414
Emotional blackmail isn't.

48:47.466 --> 48:50.803
Do you know what Australians call
Boomerangs that don't come back?

48:51.637 --> 48:52.805
- No.
- You don't?

48:56.016 --> 48:57.016
Sticks.

49:02.481 --> 49:03.625
I could have let my mouth run,

49:03.649 --> 49:05.289
they would have killed you
there and then.

49:06.152 --> 49:07.445
But you know I wouldn't do that.

49:08.821 --> 49:11.740
I couldn't hand you over
to be executed.

49:13.075 --> 49:15.619
Sticks are sticks,
no matter what you call them.

49:17.079 --> 49:19.498
I didn't grass on you
and this isn't emotional blackmail,

49:22.460 --> 49:23.460
mate.

49:29.800 --> 49:30.800
Is that all?

49:37.850 --> 49:39.518
They've made an offer for the van.

50:07.213 --> 50:09.381
How the fuck do you intend
on getting into that vault?

50:09.548 --> 50:10.174

50:56.762 --> 50:57.762
Thanks.

51:13.362 --> 51:14.362
Good morning.

51:16.824 --> 51:17.825
That's my desk.

51:19.451 --> 51:20.451
It's his desk.

51:20.661 --> 51:21.661
Sorry.

51:22.204 --> 51:23.706
Seeing as you've fucked up our work,

51:23.872 --> 51:25.541
we've come to fuck around
with yours.

51:26.041 --> 51:27.042
What am I missing?

51:27.668 --> 51:29.003
"After carrying out the robbery,

51:29.169 --> 51:30.462
we went to the archive room.

51:30.629 --> 51:32.590
One of them sprayed
the cabinets with petrol

51:32.756 --> 51:35.134
and burned all of the documents
they were storing there."

51:36.051 --> 51:37.094
FUI.

51:37.261 --> 51:39.013
Illegal payments,
undeclared earnings,

51:39.179 --> 51:42.266
money laundering systems,
front business names...

51:44.435 --> 51:45.435
All up in flames.

51:45.978 --> 51:46.978
What do you want?

51:47.313 --> 51:49.231
To give you
the paperwork you asked for.

51:49.398 --> 51:50.398
We're good people.

51:50.441 --> 51:52.151
We've brought you
the whole case file.

51:52.318 --> 51:53.902
It's of no use to us anymore.

51:54.069 --> 51:57.197
All of the Russians' accounts have
been moved to another company.

51:59.074 --> 52:00.074
What's this?

52:00.367 --> 52:02.661
We had the phone
in that office tapped

52:02.828 --> 52:04.748
until they shut down
our investigation yesterday.

52:05.164 --> 52:06.832
Two hours after the Russians
were killed

52:06.999 --> 52:08.500
he was talking
to his new partners.

52:10.628 --> 52:11.754
The transcript is there.

52:12.921 --> 52:14.161
"The plan is still in place"...

52:23.140 --> 52:25.017
Why does this bloke want
an armoured van?

52:25.351 --> 52:27.353
Asking for one is easier
than actually getting one.

52:27.686 --> 52:28.846
And I think there's something

52:28.896 --> 52:30.336
that's important to them
in that van.

52:30.481 --> 52:32.041
Your friend
doesn't want to go to prison

52:32.191 --> 52:33.525
and he's getting one over on you.

52:33.859 --> 52:34.859
It's possible.

52:35.653 --> 52:37.029
Let's imagine that's not the case.

52:37.196 --> 52:39.076
Then I'd tell you that nobody uses
the same plan

52:39.198 --> 52:40.518
- to rob the same bank.
- Exactly.

52:40.658 --> 52:43.118
That's the point, how the hell
are they going to rob the bank?

52:44.203 --> 52:45.203
Have you read the report?

52:45.329 --> 52:47.331
- The medical report?
- No, the company report.

52:47.498 --> 52:50.417
One of the workers had an accident.
Julio Emerson Mendoza.

52:50.918 --> 52:52.318
They reported he fell from high up,

52:52.419 --> 52:54.171
but the medical report
doesn't match up.

52:54.338 --> 52:57.132
Fine, find Julio and ask him.
What the fuck are we doing here?

52:57.216 --> 52:58.216
Not possible.

52:58.467 --> 52:59.467
Julio is gone.

53:00.719 --> 53:02.719
He left the same day
he was released from hospital.

53:02.805 --> 53:04.556
He had broken
his femur and six ribs,

53:04.723 --> 53:06.308
but he got straight on a plane.

53:06.642 --> 53:08.185
I've found the architect, however,

53:08.352 --> 53:09.832
and he says
that they ran out of money

53:09.895 --> 53:11.522
while this auditorium
was being built.

53:12.523 --> 53:14.083
He said that on the day
of the accident,

53:14.108 --> 53:15.108
everyone was at work

53:15.150 --> 53:17.111
hanging the window frames.

53:19.279 --> 53:20.322
Look at the report.

53:22.741 --> 53:25.202
"Prolonged asphyxia through burial."

53:25.369 --> 53:27.121
He was soldering metal
on some scaffolding,

53:27.287 --> 53:28.914
but they found earth in his lungs?

53:29.915 --> 53:33.127
They were digging a tunnel
to rob that bank, the roof caved in

53:33.293 --> 53:34.753
and they used
a legal worker's papers

53:34.920 --> 53:36.130
so as not to draw attention.

53:36.880 --> 53:38.320
Our friend Julio
didn't have a single

53:38.465 --> 53:39.967
broken bone
when he got on that plane.

53:40.759 --> 53:41.593
Can you prove it?

53:41.760 --> 53:44.012
I can prove there were no passengers
in wheelchairs.

53:44.179 --> 53:45.179
It doesn't make sense.

53:46.557 --> 53:48.957
If you go in through a tunnel,
you come out through a tunnel.

53:49.017 --> 53:50.811
If you go in in a van,
you come out in a van.

53:51.603 --> 53:54.481
Let alone that neither method deals
with the actual problem.

53:54.648 --> 53:55.691
The security systems.

53:55.858 --> 53:58.026
If you dig to the vault,
the alarms go off.

53:58.193 --> 54:00.320
If you open it at gun point,
the alarms go off.

54:00.529 --> 54:02.823
Don't tell me their way in.
Tell me their way out.

54:04.283 --> 54:05.367
Let me investigate it.

54:05.659 --> 54:07.327
It's a closed case.
They're all dead.

54:07.494 --> 54:09.329
The solicitor who wants a van
is still alive.

54:10.956 --> 54:12.124
- No.
- Why not?

54:12.291 --> 54:13.709
- Because I said no.
- Answer me.

54:14.168 --> 54:16.211
Because it's a suicide mission!

54:17.045 --> 54:18.839
You have no proof,
they're powerful people,

54:19.006 --> 54:21.425
they'll sue you and Internal Affairs
are investigating.

54:21.592 --> 54:22.801
We shouldn't even be here.

54:23.469 --> 54:24.678
You owe me, remember?

54:28.182 --> 54:31.018
Now it's your turn to answer why.

54:31.393 --> 54:32.436
Because it's my job.

54:36.732 --> 54:39.526
Nothing good is going
to come out of this.

54:40.986 --> 54:42.464
You won't be able
to help your friend.

54:42.488 --> 54:43.739
You'll have to escape with him.

54:44.698 --> 54:45.991
I'm not intending on it.

54:53.749 --> 54:55.083
Only the robbery.

54:55.709 --> 54:57.252
Leave
all this international shit out,

54:57.419 --> 54:58.003
it's not on us,

54:58.170 --> 54:59.970
or I'll bring disciplinary
action against you.

55:01.882 --> 55:03.550
And stay away from that junkie.

55:06.720 --> 55:07.720
Fine.

55:10.349 --> 55:11.475
Fine, for fuck's sake!

55:18.899 --> 55:20.067
What's up, mate?

55:23.028 --> 55:24.279
What the hell is that smell?

55:25.197 --> 55:27.157
Are you smoking crack
in a playground?

55:27.991 --> 55:29.409
Sorry, man.

55:30.118 --> 55:32.538
The same thing happened to me
with some bloke the other day.

55:32.913 --> 55:34.122
The bastard came over,

55:34.706 --> 55:37.876
got his cock out
and started having a piss.

55:38.043 --> 55:39.086
I said: "Come on, man.

55:40.796 --> 55:42.923
Can't you see this
place is full of little kids?

55:43.590 --> 55:44.591
There's no...

55:45.884 --> 55:47.177
There's nobody around now.

55:47.970 --> 55:49.429
Can we talk or are you wasted?

55:49.805 --> 55:51.098
Of course we can talk.

55:52.266 --> 55:53.266
Look.

55:58.021 --> 55:59.021
What's this?

55:59.314 --> 56:00.314
Argentina.

56:02.276 --> 56:02.943
Bonita Beach.

56:03.110 --> 56:05.654
This is what I wanted the money for.
To set up a beach bar.

56:07.698 --> 56:09.283
I need to start over.

56:10.200 --> 56:12.035
A new place, new people...

56:12.327 --> 56:13.620
I'm not talking about you.

56:13.996 --> 56:15.664
You can come whenever you like.

56:16.331 --> 56:19.209
We would have a blast.
Like in the old days, yeah?

56:20.919 --> 56:22.119
Do you think they'd give me...

56:23.297 --> 56:24.298
something...

56:25.424 --> 56:27.426
to start over?
I don't know money, papers...

56:27.593 --> 56:28.677
Then I'd sort myself out.

56:29.177 --> 56:31.221
Are you talking about witness
protection?

56:31.513 --> 56:32.806
This lot are really dangerous.

56:36.518 --> 56:37.518
Are you OK?

56:44.192 --> 56:46.069
Solid as a rock.
It's the fucking cigarettes.

56:50.073 --> 56:51.273
Nobody will offer you immunity

56:51.366 --> 56:52.926
for giving them
the address of a garage.

56:53.493 --> 56:54.661
Tell me where the van is.

56:55.329 --> 56:56.769
We'll watch it
and I give you my word

56:56.830 --> 56:58.040
that we won't arrest anyone.

56:58.373 --> 56:59.416
I won't put you at risk.

57:00.417 --> 57:02.169
Keep the money and turn yourself in.

57:05.339 --> 57:06.715
What do you mean turn myself in?

57:07.758 --> 57:08.758
Depending on the outcome,

57:08.842 --> 57:10.322
a judge may be willing
to release you,

57:10.427 --> 57:12.708
I can only guarantee a sentence
reduction for cooperating.

57:13.931 --> 57:15.557
You've always been
a bad poker player.

57:16.058 --> 57:17.058
What do you mean?

57:17.684 --> 57:21.313
A fucking awesome thief,
but a terrible player.

57:22.147 --> 57:25.150
You remember when we went
to the casino, and the cheque...

57:25.442 --> 57:26.442
Save it

57:27.653 --> 57:29.488
You have to see or raise the stakes.

57:29.905 --> 57:30.906
With the money they pay,

57:31.073 --> 57:33.075
I can disappear
and forget all my problems.

57:33.241 --> 57:35.121
- To Bonita Beach, yeah?
- Yes, to Bonita Beach.

57:35.243 --> 57:37.579
One, Argentina has an extradition
treaty with Spain.

57:37.746 --> 57:40.040
Two, you're incapable
of running a business and three,

57:40.207 --> 57:41.750
you'll have shot
that money up your arm

57:41.917 --> 57:43.837
before you even know
the price of a plane ticket.

57:45.295 --> 57:47.735
That's without considering
these people finding out I'm police

57:47.881 --> 57:49.321
and you having to make a run for it.

57:49.883 --> 57:52.511
Make a deal with me or you'll end up
with a bullet in your head.

57:54.137 --> 57:55.514
That place doesn't exist.

58:03.188 --> 58:05.148
Why don't you believe I can change?

58:05.732 --> 58:08.402
Why don't you think
I could have a life like yours?

58:28.588 --> 58:29.588
Hi.

58:30.382 --> 58:31.382
Hello.

58:55.115 --> 58:56.241
Your phone.

58:58.035 --> 58:59.161
It must be yours.

59:13.008 --> 59:14.259
Your other phone.

59:18.513 --> 59:19.513
What do you want?

59:19.598 --> 59:20.598
My stuff.

59:34.571 --> 59:35.571
Are you OK?

59:36.531 --> 59:37.531
Are you?

59:39.785 --> 59:41.661
EASTERN EUROPEAN THEFT GANG
ARRESTED IN MADRID

59:51.546 --> 59:52.672
Fuck you.

01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:01.181
You're bleeding.

01:00:02.015 --> 01:00:03.225
A dog bit me.

01:00:03.642 --> 01:00:05.560
- A dog?
- Yes, a dog.

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:09.648
The new owners left them running
loose and one of them bit me.

01:00:09.815 --> 01:00:10.982
The new club owners?

01:00:11.775 --> 01:00:13.527
The old ones are dead
or did you forget?

01:00:13.777 --> 01:00:15.362
Sit down and take off your trousers.

01:00:15.529 --> 01:00:16.530
Don't worry.

01:00:16.822 --> 01:00:18.615
Sit down and take off your trousers.

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:27.540
It hurts.

01:00:31.711 --> 01:00:33.463
Take this, it'll take the pain away.

01:00:37.467 --> 01:00:38.468
With whisky?

01:00:38.927 --> 01:00:39.927
It doesn't matter.

01:01:03.201 --> 01:01:04.201
Thanks.

01:01:11.376 --> 01:01:12.419
What happened?

01:01:15.422 --> 01:01:17.090
The police turned up
and I ran faster.

01:01:17.757 --> 01:01:18.967
Were they friends of yours?

01:01:22.345 --> 01:01:23.345
What now?

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:25.182
Now we go back to how it was before.

01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:26.748
Me doing my job
and you doing yours.

01:01:26.892 --> 01:01:28.059
You'll be back to stealing?

01:01:28.894 --> 01:01:30.061
You'll be back to stripping?

01:01:30.562 --> 01:01:31.605
Very funny.

01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:35.859
I was joking. I'm not judging you.

01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:37.444
Yes, you are.

01:01:39.321 --> 01:01:41.114
I can't. I don't know you.

01:01:41.281 --> 01:01:42.281
Exactly.

01:01:44.409 --> 01:01:45.452
Come on then.

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:49.206
- Tell me something about yourself.
- So that you can judge me?

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:50.372
No, Jesus.

01:01:51.958 --> 01:01:52.959
I was just...

01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:56.796
- It doesn't matter, leave it.
- You were just...?

01:01:57.547 --> 01:01:58.547
Curious.

01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:02.177
My father was a carpenter.

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:10.810
Where will you go?

01:02:10.977 --> 01:02:11.977
I don't know.

01:02:12.354 --> 01:02:14.356
I've been offered a trip
to a beach in Argentina.

01:02:15.106 --> 01:02:16.650
I'll pack, then we'll go.

01:02:21.112 --> 01:02:22.864
OK, let's go.

01:02:23.615 --> 01:02:24.741
But no suitcases.

01:02:24.991 --> 01:02:27.035
We have to start over,
leave everything behind.

01:02:27.202 --> 01:02:30.497
- Are we getting on the plane naked?
- Totally naked.

01:02:31.331 --> 01:02:33.750
You've got the advantage, though,
you're used to it.

01:02:36.294 --> 01:02:38.713
Imagine all the time
we'll save going through security.

01:02:39.339 --> 01:02:40.779
We won't have to take off our shoes,

01:02:40.924 --> 01:02:42.634
or our belts,
or take out our mobiles...

01:02:43.677 --> 01:02:45.929
An adventure.
No thinking about the consequences.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.285
If you bend your leg...

01:03:08.451 --> 01:03:09.452
Shut up.

01:03:46.239 --> 01:03:47.282
What are you doing here?

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:48.783
Your wife called me.

01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:52.495
She was following
operational protocol

01:03:52.746 --> 01:03:55.206
by not directly contacting
someone working undercover.

01:03:56.708 --> 01:03:59.753
Which is ironic, because you haven't
been for the last three days.

01:04:40.418 --> 01:04:41.418
He's fine.

01:04:43.546 --> 01:04:46.633
There's nothing wrong,
he just had... mucus in his airways.

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:47.800
Can I see him?

01:04:47.842 --> 01:04:48.842
She's taken him with her.

01:04:48.968 --> 01:04:50.363
She wants to get away
for a few days.

01:04:50.387 --> 01:04:51.596
She asked that you don't call.

01:04:53.556 --> 01:04:54.891
Where the fuck have you been?

01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:00.814
Why don't you take a break, as well?

01:05:01.689 --> 01:05:02.689
I can't.

01:05:02.857 --> 01:05:05.193
There's a deal on the table
and we have to respond to it.

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:06.880
If we find out
where the damn van is...

01:05:06.986 --> 01:05:07.821
Are you listening?

01:05:07.987 --> 01:05:09.787
Yes, but you aren't my dad.
Are you listening?

01:05:10.031 --> 01:05:11.031
What does he want?

01:05:11.491 --> 01:05:13.827
Immunity for a delivery van?
No way.

01:05:15.036 --> 01:05:16.121
He has to turn himself in.

01:05:16.996 --> 01:05:19.624
If he works with us, we'll testify
on his behalf. That's all.

01:05:19.791 --> 01:05:21.793
- Why won't you help me?
- I am helping you!

01:05:22.544 --> 01:05:23.904
I won't let you sign a blank check

01:05:24.003 --> 01:05:25.547
for a junkie
who could be lying to us!

01:05:25.713 --> 01:05:28.216
Get that fucking no-hoper out
of your life and close the case.

01:05:28.591 --> 01:05:29.592
And do it today.

01:05:30.176 --> 01:05:32.220
I'm not your father,
but I am your superior.

01:05:53.116 --> 01:05:54.116
Long time no see.

01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:56.660
Give me a beer.

01:06:06.171 --> 01:06:07.755
It's like coming home, isn't it?

01:06:09.215 --> 01:06:10.215
Exactly the same.

01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:21.102
I need you to tell me
where the van is.

01:06:21.519 --> 01:06:22.519
Of course.

01:06:23.521 --> 01:06:24.772
You're my priority.

01:06:26.149 --> 01:06:27.149
What are you offering?

01:06:27.692 --> 01:06:28.692
- I was thinking...
- Oi!

01:06:29.027 --> 01:06:30.111
Give me another beer!

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:31.520
Why don't you get it yourself?

01:06:31.613 --> 01:06:33.053
Because there isn't a soul
in the bar

01:06:33.114 --> 01:06:35.366
and you're a nice bloke, right?

01:06:36.451 --> 01:06:38.036
What an arsehole.

01:06:38.411 --> 01:06:39.621
Fuck me...

01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:42.832
- We can sort this out.
- No.

01:06:43.249 --> 01:06:44.959
Only a judge can sort this out.

01:06:45.585 --> 01:06:48.046
Argentina, protection, money...
Remember?

01:06:49.547 --> 01:06:50.340
Fine, let's talk

01:06:50.548 --> 01:06:52.948
- and come to an agreement then, OK?
- OK, let's start again.

01:06:53.301 --> 01:06:54.301
What are you offering?

01:06:56.471 --> 01:06:57.722
I'm trying to help you...

01:06:57.889 --> 01:06:59.474
Course you bloody are,
you're my mate,

01:06:59.641 --> 01:07:00.767
but what are you offering?

01:07:00.934 --> 01:07:02.060
Why aren't you listening?

01:07:15.907 --> 01:07:17.507
I'm not listening
because you're on edge,

01:07:17.534 --> 01:07:18.974
wearing the same clothes
as yesterday

01:07:19.077 --> 01:07:20.221
and you're drinking on the job.

01:07:20.245 --> 01:07:21.889
You have a sign
on your forehead that says:

01:07:21.913 --> 01:07:23.122
"I've got nothing for you."

01:07:23.831 --> 01:07:27.460
- So you're psychic now, are you?
- Well, sometimes... I see things.

01:07:27.669 --> 01:07:30.255
Look, let me prove it to you.

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:34.592
Do you want to know
when the world will end?

01:07:36.427 --> 01:07:38.263
The world will end when you die.

01:07:39.013 --> 01:07:40.013
Look at me,

01:07:40.765 --> 01:07:43.645
I'm old before my time. I don't even
think I've got ten years left in me.

01:07:44.143 --> 01:07:45.143
So when I get wasted,

01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:47.188
it makes me nostalgic
and I like to...

01:07:47.355 --> 01:07:49.107
to remember the good times.

01:07:49.732 --> 01:07:52.294
Seeing a line of sports cars parked
outside a restaurant and snap,

01:07:52.318 --> 01:07:53.358
taking one just like that.

01:07:54.404 --> 01:07:56.239
Robbing a jewellers and giving

01:07:56.406 --> 01:07:58.783
the most expensive ring
to a stranger.

01:07:59.867 --> 01:08:00.867
Come on.

01:08:01.911 --> 01:08:03.454
I didn't give it away, I lost it.

01:08:03.955 --> 01:08:05.540
You were always a romantic.

01:08:06.291 --> 01:08:07.875
I didn't give it away, I lost it.

01:08:09.794 --> 01:08:11.129
Good times...

01:08:13.464 --> 01:08:15.258
Fucking awesome times.

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:19.470
Most of them with you, mate.

01:08:21.389 --> 01:08:22.473
Well, I've forgotten them.

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:24.267
I take life as it comes.

01:08:33.984 --> 01:08:35.069
Five years?

01:08:37.572 --> 01:08:39.073
Half of what I've got left.

01:08:39.823 --> 01:08:42.243
Christ.
The best of what I've got left.

01:08:42.577 --> 01:08:43.995
You'll be out in a year, I promise.

01:08:46.997 --> 01:08:48.332
See or raise the stakes.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.399
Look, I'm fucking sick of this now.

01:08:50.501 --> 01:08:52.920
There's no bet and there's no money,
and do you know why?

01:08:53.087 --> 01:08:54.982
Because I'm going to tell
those people that I'm police

01:08:55.006 --> 01:08:57.246
and you'll have to turn yourself in
or they'll shoot you.

01:09:00.511 --> 01:09:01.511
See how easy it is?

01:09:03.555 --> 01:09:04.849
Would you really do that?

01:09:05.015 --> 01:09:06.392
You're leaving me no choice.

01:09:08.102 --> 01:09:09.187
You know what?

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:11.939
I think you're lying.

01:09:14.942 --> 01:09:17.028
I think you do remember
the good times.

01:09:18.404 --> 01:09:20.238
The drinking sessions, the girls...

01:09:23.283 --> 01:09:25.995
And when you swam away
at that beach.

01:09:34.087 --> 01:09:36.631
But don't worry,
you don't owe me anything.

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:43.011
I owe you nothing.

01:09:45.264 --> 01:09:46.264
Fine.

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:48.350
Take care.

01:09:50.937 --> 01:09:52.313
I'll be seeing you, big fella!

01:09:58.486 --> 01:10:00.405
Everybody stay calm,
this is not a raid.

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:03.449
Finish your drink, pal.
I'm sure it isn't cheap here.

01:10:03.741 --> 01:10:05.952
Waiter, ID on the bar. Now.

01:10:17.922 --> 01:10:20.383
Good morning.
Passport, ID or work permit.

01:10:24.303 --> 01:10:25.503
Have you got something to say?

01:10:27.473 --> 01:10:29.183
You heard him! Come on!

01:10:29.517 --> 01:10:30.768
Papers on the table!

01:10:48.161 --> 01:10:48.995
The dance is over.

01:10:49.162 --> 01:10:50.788
Go home
and have a fucking cold shower.

01:10:57.795 --> 01:11:00.214
You can go back to your room.
We'll be finished in a minute.

01:11:13.936 --> 01:11:14.936
Let go.

01:11:15.354 --> 01:11:16.354
Don't touch her!

01:11:29.327 --> 01:11:30.912
- What are you doing?
- Giving up.

01:11:31.078 --> 01:11:32.518
I don't know
how they'll rob the bank

01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:33.580
or how they'll escape.

01:11:33.664 --> 01:11:35.642
I have no fucking clue
what they'll do with the van,

01:11:35.666 --> 01:11:36.667
the alarms or the tunnel.

01:11:37.418 --> 01:11:38.418
I don't know anything.

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:43.840
What's this?

01:11:45.051 --> 01:11:46.385
Three deportation orders.

01:11:46.636 --> 01:11:49.639
They came on a tourist visa
and they're running a strip club.

01:11:50.139 --> 01:11:51.459
All three have priors for robbery

01:11:51.516 --> 01:11:53.660
and it took them less than 12 hours
to take over the business.

01:11:53.684 --> 01:11:56.270
It seems like an awful lot
of effort to me, just for a brothel.

01:11:56.854 --> 01:11:58.439
I need you to sign and process it.

01:11:59.023 --> 01:12:00.024
Case closed.

01:12:00.775 --> 01:12:01.901
I'm a new man.

01:12:03.778 --> 01:12:04.778
You're suspended.

01:12:06.197 --> 01:12:07.197
What?

01:12:15.206 --> 01:12:16.457
Your badge and your gun.

01:12:23.756 --> 01:12:24.756
Are you there?

01:12:26.509 --> 01:12:27.760
Open up, it's me.

01:12:36.394 --> 01:12:38.980
Come on, wake up.
Wake the fuck up!

01:12:39.230 --> 01:12:40.773
Fucking come on! Wake up!

01:12:40.982 --> 01:12:41.982
Don't do this to me.

01:12:42.108 --> 01:12:43.108
Don't do this to me.

01:12:43.901 --> 01:12:44.901
Don't do this to me.

01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:51.271
<i>- Emergency services.
- Yeah, please,</i> I <i>need</i> an <i>ambulance.</i>

01:12:51.325 --> 01:12:53.327
I'm a policeman.
Badge number 2714...

01:12:58.291 --> 01:12:59.417
You stupid bastard.

01:13:04.672 --> 01:13:07.383
What are you...?
What are you doing, man?

01:13:57.892 --> 01:13:59.018
What are you doing?

01:13:59.268 --> 01:14:01.108
No, don't touch anything.
Don't touch anything!

01:14:03.314 --> 01:14:05.107
What the hell are you doing?

01:14:08.027 --> 01:14:11.197
Get me out of here first,
then you can take what you want, OK?

01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:12.531
Will you shut up? No...

01:14:15.451 --> 01:14:16.786
Are you listening to me?

01:14:18.621 --> 01:14:19.705
Don't touch anything.

01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:30.341
Are you going to say anything?

01:14:36.639 --> 01:14:37.807
TRACKER

01:14:38.015 --> 01:14:39.015
Fine...

01:14:40.059 --> 01:14:41.059
Just fine.

01:14:43.521 --> 01:14:44.855
SEARCHING

01:14:45.064 --> 01:14:46.524
SENSOR NOT FOUND

01:14:49.443 --> 01:14:50.778
Fucking bastards.

01:15:05.459 --> 01:15:06.459
So?

01:15:12.299 --> 01:15:13.426
What are we going to do?

01:15:14.802 --> 01:15:16.220
What we've always done.

01:15:55.509 --> 01:15:56.709
Everything's going to be fine.

01:16:39.303 --> 01:16:40.721
What the fuck is wrong then?

01:16:41.388 --> 01:16:42.765
Chill out. On my signal.

01:16:53.567 --> 01:16:54.567
Morning.

01:16:57.655 --> 01:16:59.255
Move and I'll blow
your fucking head off!

01:16:59.281 --> 01:17:00.281
On my bloody signal!

01:17:55.713 --> 01:17:58.549
Everyone on the floor!
This is a robbery!

01:18:03.053 --> 01:18:04.053
Don't move.

01:18:04.847 --> 01:18:06.098
On the fucking floor!

01:18:08.809 --> 01:18:11.169
Good morning. The Bank Manager
and the financial controller.

01:18:16.734 --> 01:18:19.612
Good. You and you stay here.
Everyone else out. Now.

01:18:24.742 --> 01:18:26.285
Everyone out on the fucking street!

01:18:26.452 --> 01:18:27.494
Come on!

01:18:27.953 --> 01:18:29.038
Everyone outside!

01:18:43.969 --> 01:18:45.346
An alarm just went off.

01:18:45.512 --> 01:18:46.512
Where?

01:18:48.766 --> 01:18:49.934
You won't believe this.

01:19:02.696 --> 01:19:03.989
What are you doing?

01:19:06.951 --> 01:19:08.327
Motivational exercises.

01:19:10.287 --> 01:19:11.288
I know what's coming,

01:19:11.455 --> 01:19:13.165
you're going
to object to my line of work,

01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:15.501
cry, tell me about your family,
your four kids,

01:19:15.668 --> 01:19:17.503
your dog, your cat...

01:19:18.003 --> 01:19:19.083
I prefer to avoid all that.

01:19:21.757 --> 01:19:24.593
Twenty minutes to open the safe
and two to get out of here.

01:19:27.513 --> 01:19:29.515
If you touch the detonator,
it explodes,

01:19:29.682 --> 01:19:31.433
if we run out of time,
it explodes.

01:19:32.893 --> 01:19:34.228
And if this lock doesn't open...,

01:19:34.645 --> 01:19:37.189
it explodes.
Good luck, gentleman.

01:20:19.023 --> 01:20:20.023
They're here.

01:20:20.774 --> 01:20:21.774
I'm coming.

01:20:48.594 --> 01:20:49.594
Put him on.

01:20:55.267 --> 01:20:56.267
Yes.

01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:58.729
You're completely surrounded,
you have no way out.

01:20:58.896 --> 01:21:01.231
<i>You're a good bloke,
you let these people go free.</i>

01:21:01.482 --> 01:21:05.027
Let the two hostages out
and you two can leave, too.

01:21:05.319 --> 01:21:07.112
Thanks, mate.
Listen, just a few things.

01:21:07.529 --> 01:21:09.198
The first, you just got
here which means

01:21:09.365 --> 01:21:10.949
I'm not talking
to armed response,

01:21:11.116 --> 01:21:13.202
just the first patrol car
on the scene.

01:21:14.661 --> 01:21:15.954
Second, well, yes.

01:21:16.121 --> 01:21:17.122
It's the bane of my life.

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:19.476
I'm trying to be
one of the good guys,

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:20.500
I'm trying really hard,

01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:22.961
but I never quite manage it.

01:21:24.588 --> 01:21:25.881
I'm on the top floor.

01:21:27.049 --> 01:21:28.777
Pull back the two men
you have in the car park

01:21:28.801 --> 01:21:30.601
or I'll throw the first body
from the balcony.

01:22:07.256 --> 01:22:08.256
Out.

01:23:01.935 --> 01:23:03.562
This is fucking great.

01:23:06.607 --> 01:23:07.607
It is.

01:23:33.175 --> 01:23:34.426
CID. What's going on?

01:23:35.344 --> 01:23:36.344
Two thieves.

01:23:36.386 --> 01:23:38.722
I've spoken to one of them
and he was very hostile.

01:23:58.158 --> 01:23:58.825
TRACKER

01:23:59.034 --> 01:24:00.410
START

01:24:59.761 --> 01:25:00.929
Bomb!

01:25:04.850 --> 01:25:06.226
Don't look into the flame.

01:25:06.393 --> 01:25:09.233
Just keep an eye on the thermometers
and the watches in the bottles, OK?

01:25:09.938 --> 01:25:10.938
Come on.

01:25:12.357 --> 01:25:13.357
CID.

01:25:13.442 --> 01:25:14.442
Inspector.

01:25:14.568 --> 01:25:15.568
Where are they?

01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:18.238
- Inside.
- What?

01:25:18.488 --> 01:25:20.907
Maybe they heard us and locked
themselves inside the vault.

01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:23.910
The Bank Manager said
they threatened them with a bomb.

01:25:24.911 --> 01:25:26.496
I think things are getting out hand.

01:25:54.274 --> 01:25:56.109
CID. I'm in charge of this case.

01:25:56.568 --> 01:25:59.112
Is there any way to communicate
with them inside the vault?

01:25:59.738 --> 01:26:01.198
A phone or an intercom?

01:26:01.698 --> 01:26:02.698
No.

01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:04.950
Do they have light?

01:26:05.827 --> 01:26:07.412
Do they have electricity?

01:26:08.205 --> 01:26:09.831
- Yes.
- Turn it off.

01:26:13.835 --> 01:26:15.379
How can I open that door?

01:26:16.046 --> 01:26:17.926
Without keys
or an opening mechanism, you can't.

01:26:18.048 --> 01:26:19.341
Is there no way of fixing it?

01:26:19.591 --> 01:26:20.967
Isn't there a copy of the keys?

01:26:22.302 --> 01:26:24.012
The manufacturer
is sending a technician.

01:26:25.681 --> 01:26:26.973
He's on his way from Austria.

01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:33.063
Is there anything here
that is not a fucking joke?

01:26:47.035 --> 01:26:48.035
Jin together two bars.

01:26:48.328 --> 01:26:49.413
One long and one short.

01:26:50.956 --> 01:26:51.956
Are you OK?

01:26:53.583 --> 01:26:54.960
Better than ever, mate.

01:26:56.086 --> 01:26:57.087
Better than ever.

01:27:00.090 --> 01:27:02.360
There are three deportation orders
on the desk in my office,

01:27:02.384 --> 01:27:04.304
- I want an arrest warrant for them.
- I'm on it.

01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:09.140
<i>I can't take your call right now,
leave a message.</i>

01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:15.731
Why did they let the hostages go?

01:27:23.488 --> 01:27:25.031
Are the oxygen levels OK?

01:27:26.158 --> 01:27:27.158
Full pelt.

01:27:38.879 --> 01:27:39.879
What's wrong?

01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:41.673
It's clogged up. There's ice.

01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:56.772
It's really hot, man.

01:27:57.063 --> 01:27:58.063
No...

01:27:58.899 --> 01:28:00.150
It's about to get much hotter.

01:28:07.908 --> 01:28:09.451
Why is this door so hot?

01:28:11.411 --> 01:28:12.851
Do you have
a thermal-imaging camera?

01:28:12.954 --> 01:28:14.372
We don't, but the fire officers do.

01:28:15.624 --> 01:28:17.626
It's the money.
They're burning the money.

01:28:18.210 --> 01:28:19.770
There are
tonnes of paper notes inthere.

01:28:19.836 --> 01:28:20.587
Get him out of here.

01:28:20.796 --> 01:28:21.796
What?

01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:24.341
You can't kick me out!
This is my bank.

01:28:24.508 --> 01:28:26.176
Do you hear me? My bank!

01:28:33.141 --> 01:28:34.141
Mate!

01:28:34.476 --> 01:28:35.476
Oi, mate!

01:28:36.895 --> 01:28:37.895
Is that it?

01:28:38.688 --> 01:28:40.128
No,
there's still a little way to go.

01:28:41.525 --> 01:28:42.609
What's your beach like?

01:28:43.652 --> 01:28:45.195
Eh? Bonita Beach, what's it like?

01:28:45.362 --> 01:28:46.363
Covered in stones.

01:28:47.239 --> 01:28:48.239
I didn't want to imagine

01:28:48.365 --> 01:28:51.201
the usual
white sand filled paradise.

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:54.579
I wanted... I wanted something real.

01:29:19.479 --> 01:29:20.479
What?

01:29:21.648 --> 01:29:22.648
It's done.

01:29:24.693 --> 01:29:25.693
What?

01:29:27.279 --> 01:29:28.530
That's it. It's done.

01:29:30.282 --> 01:29:31.741
A little over 100 degrees.

01:29:31.992 --> 01:29:34.286
There's a very powerful heat source
coming from this area.

01:29:34.911 --> 01:29:35.911
May I?

01:29:36.037 --> 01:29:37.037
Sure.

01:29:41.209 --> 01:29:44.129
I want you to check the basements
of the neighbouring buildings.

01:29:44.337 --> 01:29:45.380
What are we looking for?

01:29:46.756 --> 01:29:47.756
A tunnel...

01:29:48.633 --> 01:29:49.633
A tunnel to where?

01:30:42.646 --> 01:30:44.439
What the hell is this?

01:30:50.070 --> 01:30:51.112
What is that?

01:31:07.337 --> 01:31:08.337
Water.

01:31:08.755 --> 01:31:10.090
We're going for a swim.

01:31:13.802 --> 01:31:15.011
Can you blow this door off?

01:31:15.220 --> 01:31:16.300
Yes, but we'd be comprising

01:31:16.346 --> 01:31:18.014
the structural integrity
of the building.

01:31:19.391 --> 01:31:20.809
I need every available officer.

01:31:21.017 --> 01:31:23.329
I need to widen the search area
to two kilometres and I need

01:31:23.353 --> 01:31:24.396
check points in the roads.

01:31:24.646 --> 01:31:26.106
Which roads, sir?

01:31:29.567 --> 01:31:30.567
All of them.

01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:06.520
Mate!

01:32:09.691 --> 01:32:10.691
Mate...

01:32:11.026 --> 01:32:12.026
We're leaving.

01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:43.952
I need you to get better.

01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:45.203
I will, man...

01:33:45.995 --> 01:33:47.038
We go back

01:33:47.872 --> 01:33:49.624
and take all of that money with us.

01:34:00.969 --> 01:34:02.470
What have you done, you bastard?

01:34:03.471 --> 01:34:05.849
- Come on.
- Motherfucker, what have you done?

01:34:12.689 --> 01:34:14.065
I'm going to kill you.

01:34:14.732 --> 01:34:16.526
I'll kill you, you motherfucker.

01:34:17.026 --> 01:34:20.530
I'll cut your balls off with a razor
and feed them to the dogs.

01:34:21.865 --> 01:34:22.865
Do you hear me?

01:34:23.658 --> 01:34:25.201
I'm going to ruin your life.

01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:31.916
I'm going to kill you.

01:34:36.671 --> 01:34:38.756
I'm going to kill you!

01:34:41.718 --> 01:34:42.969
AMBULANCE

01:35:04.991 --> 01:35:07.111
There was enough money there
for a thousand lifetimes.

01:35:08.786 --> 01:35:10.038
I only need one.

01:35:10.872 --> 01:35:11.998
So do I.

01:35:32.685 --> 01:35:33.811
What is this?

01:35:36.439 --> 01:35:37.482
Bonita Beach.

01:35:42.237 --> 01:35:44.113
There was so much more, man.

01:35:49.577 --> 01:35:51.496
There was loads more!

01:35:52.288 --> 01:35:53.831
There was loads more!

01:36:01.381 --> 01:36:02.966
You can have part of the restaurant.

01:36:03.132 --> 01:36:04.772
What? A restaurant?
Wasn't it a beach bar?

01:36:04.926 --> 01:36:09.430
Beach bar? Fuck the beach bar.
A massive fucking restaurant.

01:36:12.892 --> 01:36:13.892
Let's go.

01:36:15.603 --> 01:36:17.522
Me and you, together.
Like the good old days.

01:36:18.648 --> 01:36:20.066
You've always brought me luck.

01:36:20.608 --> 01:36:22.448
I know everything will be fine
if I'm with you.

01:36:25.947 --> 01:36:26.947
Let's go.

01:36:28.366 --> 01:36:30.118
We've got to get rid of this thing.

01:36:31.202 --> 01:36:32.537
Where can we take it?

01:36:35.415 --> 01:36:38.626
You only need two things
in this life, you hear me?

01:36:39.877 --> 01:36:41.296
One is to know who you are

01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:44.382
and the other is to know
who you can trust.

01:36:46.009 --> 01:36:47.593
Me and you have
both of those things.

01:36:51.431 --> 01:36:52.807
Let's go, mate.

01:36:57.895 --> 01:36:59.314
Let's go.

01:37:02.692 --> 01:37:04.027
Where can we take it?

01:37:26.132 --> 01:37:27.800
EASTERN EUROPEAN GANG
UNDER ARREST

01:37:27.967 --> 01:37:30.845
THEY ARE SUSPECTED TO HAVE
MURDERED A WELL-KNOWN SOLICITOR

01:37:36.976 --> 01:37:37.976
May I?

01:37:39.604 --> 01:37:40.604
Of course.

01:37:49.655 --> 01:37:50.655
I called you.

01:37:51.366 --> 01:37:52.366
Me too.

01:37:56.537 --> 01:37:57.537
How was your day?

01:38:01.501 --> 01:38:03.461
It could have been easier.

01:38:16.516 --> 01:38:17.516
Why?

01:38:18.434 --> 01:38:21.938
Internal Affairs have decided to
steer clear of this investigation.

01:38:22.772 --> 01:38:24.732
They won't be bringing
any charges against you.

01:38:28.778 --> 01:38:31.090
I was going to bring you your gun,
but then I thought to myself,

01:38:31.114 --> 01:38:32.532
the lad's on holiday...

01:38:33.699 --> 01:38:35.410
Let him have a break.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.560
How about
you leave it all in my drawer?

01:38:45.253 --> 01:38:46.671
Will you be coming by to get it?

01:38:50.925 --> 01:38:51.926
Just leave it there.

01:39:05.231 --> 01:39:06.231
Drinks on you?

01:39:10.570 --> 01:39:11.696
You must be skint, are you?

01:39:15.450 --> 01:39:16.450
Thanks.

01:40:39.951 --> 01:40:41.160
I'm sorry.
