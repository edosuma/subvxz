[instrumental music]

01:25.552 --> 01:28.154
Ah, this is getting ridiculous.

01:28.188 --> 01:29.556
I didn't have time
to do the laundry yesterday.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.758
This is the only clean shirt
I've got to wear to work.

01:31.792 --> 01:34.360
You think this looks okay
with a tie?

01:34.394 --> 01:36.429
Well, it looks
pretty stylish to me.

01:39.199 --> 01:40.133
Yeah.

01:42.503 --> 01:44.838
Cousin, don't worry.
I do the laundry tonight.

01:44.871 --> 01:45.772
‐ Mm.
‐ Oh, wait a minute.

01:45.806 --> 01:47.207
I, I can't.

01:47.240 --> 01:48.875
I got, uh, to study for history

01:48.909 --> 01:51.344
and I'm three days
behind on the dishes.

01:51.377 --> 01:53.246
Well, now I barely have
time to eat breakfast.

01:54.480 --> 01:56.316
Cousin, I'm, I'm sorry

01:56.349 --> 01:58.184
but there are
no clean bowls for your cereal.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.421
But that's okay because

02:01.454 --> 02:03.356
there are no clean spoons
for your cereal.

02:05.692 --> 02:06.860
[exhales]

02:06.893 --> 02:08.394
Care for a handful of cereal?

02:11.932 --> 02:13.667
Balki, the apartment is a mess.

02:13.700 --> 02:14.868
Mm.

02:14.901 --> 02:15.936
Between your goin'
to college at night

02:15.969 --> 02:18.271
and my extra work at the paper,
w‐we don't have time

02:18.304 --> 02:20.841
to get caught up on
the household chores anymore.

02:20.874 --> 02:22.776
I think we should get a maid.

02:22.809 --> 02:25.812
Cousin, I hardly think getting
a young woman to milk a goat

02:25.846 --> 02:28.515
is going to solve our problem.

02:28.549 --> 02:30.817
Not a milkmaid.

02:30.851 --> 02:33.854
I'm talking about a maid.

02:33.887 --> 02:36.189
Someone who comes in while
we're at work, cleans up

02:36.222 --> 02:37.524
and is gone
by the time we get home.

02:37.558 --> 02:40.627
O‐o‐oh! On Mypos, we call
those people thieves.

02:43.396 --> 02:45.666
[exhales]
Well, in America
we call them maids

02:45.699 --> 02:47.568
and we're going to get one.

02:47.601 --> 02:49.269
We're gonna hire someone
to come in once a week

02:49.302 --> 02:51.505
and clean this place up.

02:51.538 --> 02:53.206
Fine by me!

02:55.441 --> 02:56.442
Milk?

02:57.744 --> 03:00.647
[instrumental music]

03:06.853 --> 03:08.822
‐ Uh.
‐ Cousin..

03:08.855 --> 03:10.757
I've been lookin'
for two days and nothin'.

03:10.791 --> 03:12.659
I can't believe what
they charge for housekeepers!

03:12.693 --> 03:14.260
Well, wait till
you hear this, I got..

03:14.294 --> 03:16.697
Most of these people
make more money than I do!

03:16.730 --> 03:17.698
Well, wait till you hear this.

03:17.731 --> 03:19.299
It's impossible to find a maid

03:19.332 --> 03:21.001
who'll work for $35 a day.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.969
Cousin, I found a maid!

03:23.003 --> 03:24.370
‐ You did?
‐ Y‐yeah!

03:24.404 --> 03:25.471
‐ You found a maid?
‐ Yeah!

03:25.506 --> 03:27.641
You found someone who's willing
to work for $35 a day?

03:27.674 --> 03:29.610
No.

03:29.643 --> 03:32.312
I found someone who's
willing to work every day

03:32.345 --> 03:34.715
for thirty five dollars a week!

03:34.748 --> 03:36.883
Can I sniff out
a bargain or what?

03:39.720 --> 03:41.755
There's gotta be a catch.

03:41.788 --> 03:44.224
You gotta be crazy
to work for $35 a week.

03:45.992 --> 03:49.429
You didn't hire
a crazy person, did you?

03:49.462 --> 03:52.533
Well, of course I didn't,
don't be ridiculous!

03:54.601 --> 03:56.637
Would I give
the week's grocery money

03:56.670 --> 03:59.472
to a crazy person
to shop for us?

03:59.506 --> 04:03.710
You gave the week's grocery
money to a total stranger?

04:03.744 --> 04:07.013
Cousin, try to pay attention.

04:09.583 --> 04:12.285
I didn't give the week's grocery
money to a total stranger.

04:12.318 --> 04:14.755
I gave it to a woman
who I have very

04:14.788 --> 04:16.957
very good feeling about.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.795
O‐o‐oh! You had
a good feeling about her?

04:21.827 --> 04:24.931
‐ Yes.
‐ Oh, well, I stand corrected.

04:24.965 --> 04:26.432
It's okay.

04:26.466 --> 04:28.535
You didn't give
our money to a crazy person..

04:28.569 --> 04:30.737
‐ No.
‐ ...you are the crazy person!

04:30.771 --> 04:32.839
What is the matter with you?

04:32.873 --> 04:34.675
Balki, that's the last
you'll see of her.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.877
She's probably out
blowing our money at the track.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.945
Uh. Oh, I'm sorry.

04:38.979 --> 04:41.314
It took so long,
but I got a butcher

04:41.347 --> 04:42.983
who didn't know his ribs
from his rump, heh, heh, heh.

04:45.886 --> 04:49.455
O‐oh, you must be Larry.

04:49.489 --> 04:51.692
I've heard a lot about you. Heh.

04:51.725 --> 04:54.928
Listen, I've seen your bedroom.
I think I can save it.

04:56.429 --> 04:57.698
Uh.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.766
Cousin, this, this is she.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.936
This is our new housekeeper.

05:02.969 --> 05:05.506
I like you to meet Mrs. Bailey.

05:05.539 --> 05:08.408
Mrs. Bailey, I‐I think
there's been a misunderstanding.

05:08.441 --> 05:10.010
Oh, you probably think
you're dealing

05:10.043 --> 05:11.978
with a crazy person, right?

05:12.012 --> 05:14.047
Well, well, why would
I think that? Heh.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.682
Well, because
only a crazy person

05:15.716 --> 05:17.417
would work for $35 a week.

05:17.450 --> 05:19.886
Well, that does seem logical.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.454
The only thing
that makes me crazy

05:21.487 --> 05:23.724
is sitting around
my empty house doing nothing.

05:23.757 --> 05:25.892
[chuckles]
I don't need the money.

05:25.926 --> 05:27.894
It's the work
that makes me happy.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.696
You got
an 8 inch springform cake pan?

05:32.933 --> 05:34.868
I, uh, kinda doubt it.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.138
Well, now, I've got
just enough time

05:38.171 --> 05:41.041
to do the laundry
before I start making dinner.

05:41.074 --> 05:43.644
‐ You boys like chocolate cake?
‐ Yes!

05:43.677 --> 05:45.746
It's Cousin Larry's favorite!

05:45.779 --> 05:47.648
Then chocolate it is. Heh, heh.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.382
Heh, wai.. Uh, uh, here

05:49.415 --> 05:50.651
uh, Mrs. Bailey, let
me give you a hand‐‐

05:50.684 --> 05:52.686
No, no, no. That's my job.

05:52.719 --> 05:54.755
Your job is to get
these clothes dirty.

05:54.788 --> 05:57.057
And by the looks of things,
you're the best.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.961
[laughs]
Thanks. I'll be back.

06:03.429 --> 06:05.832
Well, uh, cousin, it appears

06:05.866 --> 06:09.903
that someone has found us
a rather incredible maid.

06:12.472 --> 06:15.542
Is there anything you'd like
to say to that someone?

06:16.577 --> 06:18.845
Yes.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.782
What the hell is
an 8 inch springform cake pan?

06:21.815 --> 06:24.551
[instrumental music]

06:32.458 --> 06:34.094
Good morning, Harriette.

06:34.127 --> 06:36.162
Oh, good mornin', baby.

06:36.196 --> 06:39.199
Mmm‐mm, look at you.

06:39.232 --> 06:42.669
I haven't seen you this
wrinkle‐free in ages.

06:42.703 --> 06:43.937
That new maid
must really be somethin'.

06:43.970 --> 06:45.506
Oh, yes, she is something.

06:45.539 --> 06:47.674
She is somethin'.

06:47.708 --> 06:50.176
She's there early before we get
up, has a big breakfast waiting.

06:50.210 --> 06:51.712
Dinner's ready when we get home.

06:51.745 --> 06:54.748
She does the laundry,
the dishes, the shopping.

06:54.781 --> 06:56.049
She even turns down the beds

06:56.082 --> 06:58.018
and has a little mint
on the pillow.

06:59.653 --> 07:01.655
Sounds like you died
and went to a Holiday Inn!

07:01.688 --> 07:03.156
Yeah.

07:03.189 --> 07:04.991
And I should be happy.

07:06.492 --> 07:08.128
So what's the problem?

07:08.161 --> 07:10.130
Well, uh, I, I don't know.

07:11.832 --> 07:14.501
I got somebody who waits
on me hand and foot

07:14.535 --> 07:15.502
and, uh

07:16.637 --> 07:18.038
it's startin'
to get on my nerves.

07:19.673 --> 07:21.675
Look, you're never
gonna believe this.

07:21.708 --> 07:22.743
[Harriette laughing]

07:24.177 --> 07:26.479
‐ Mr. Gorpley's in a good mood!
‐ You're kidding.

07:26.513 --> 07:28.882
No, he, he let me play
darts with him.

07:28.915 --> 07:30.717
‐ Is that right?
‐ 'Yeah!'

07:30.751 --> 07:32.586
I got to hold the board!

07:37.123 --> 07:39.526
What's that on your shirt, baby?

07:39.560 --> 07:42.563
Oh, this is a, a note
that, that Mrs. Bailey

07:42.596 --> 07:45.098
pinned to me to remind me
to take my vitamins.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.667
Isn't it a good idea?

07:46.700 --> 07:49.002
Now, Cousin Larry
and I will never..

07:49.035 --> 07:51.171
Cousin Larry and I will never

07:51.204 --> 07:52.238
forget anything.

07:52.272 --> 07:54.708
What? You‐you took
your note off?

07:54.741 --> 07:56.877
I think I can remember to floss.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.814
Well, I certainly hope so

08:00.847 --> 08:03.984
because as Mrs. Bailey says

08:04.017 --> 08:07.988
plaque is the leading cause of
tooth decay and gingivitis.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.757
Mm.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.926
Mrs. Bailey is so smart.

08:12.959 --> 08:14.661
I always thought that gingivitis

08:14.695 --> 08:16.963
was Fred Astaire's
dancing partner

08:19.800 --> 08:21.768
Oh, there you are.

08:21.802 --> 08:24.838
Mrs. Bailey! Mrs. Bailey!

08:24.871 --> 08:28.074
...oh, oh, what am I
gonna do with you boys?

08:28.108 --> 08:30.577
You walked right out
without taking your galoshes.

08:30.611 --> 08:32.779
I mean, it's bad enough
you're gonna ruin your shoes

08:32.813 --> 08:34.581
you wanna ruin
your health, too?

08:34.615 --> 08:37.150
No, I don't! I would never do
anything like that to you.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.952
I'm so sorry.

08:38.985 --> 08:40.320
Oh, and you‐you came
all the way down here.

08:40.352 --> 08:42.087
You‐you shouldn't have
come down here.

08:42.121 --> 08:43.990
Uh, he's right.
You really shouldn't have.

08:45.592 --> 08:47.293
Bartokomous!

08:47.327 --> 08:49.262
Get these memos out
to everybody in circulation.

08:49.295 --> 08:50.831
Okay.

08:50.864 --> 08:51.965
See to it that all
these sacks are sorted.

08:51.998 --> 08:53.767
Oh, okay.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.168
And remember to get all
your pick‐ups done early today.

08:55.201 --> 08:56.570
Okay.

08:56.603 --> 08:57.571
‐ Go!
‐ Okay.

08:57.604 --> 08:58.639
Go!

08:58.672 --> 09:01.241
Pardon me, young man.

09:01.274 --> 09:04.077
There is a nicer way
to ask for things.

09:06.312 --> 09:09.716
And I didn't once hear
you use the magic word.

09:13.253 --> 09:16.322
‐ Excuse me?
‐ No, no, no. Not excuse me.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.161
Ple‐e‐ease.

09:21.194 --> 09:23.630
And you should smile
more! Heh, heh.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.132
Balki, come here.

09:28.034 --> 09:29.636
Say you're sorry.

09:35.642 --> 09:36.777
[sobs]
I'm sorry.

09:49.389 --> 09:51.391
Is he always like that?

09:51.424 --> 09:52.993
No.

09:54.895 --> 09:57.998
Sometimes he'll wear a plaid.

09:58.031 --> 09:59.800
Oh, I almost forgot.

09:59.833 --> 10:03.770
I tried that recipe you told
me about for pig snout puffs.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.005
‐ You did?.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.940
Now, be honest.

10:06.973 --> 10:09.209
I've never worked
with snout before.

10:13.146 --> 10:14.715
Just like Mama used to make!

10:14.748 --> 10:16.950
‐ Heh, heh, heh.
‐ Mmm, mmm, mmm.

10:16.983 --> 10:18.752
Mrs. Bailey, let's go offer

10:18.785 --> 10:21.287
the uneaten ones to my friend
Jimmy the security guard.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.857
‐ Oh, that'll be fun.
‐ Okay. Come on.

10:23.890 --> 10:26.827
Oh, Larry, what did I
tell you about your posture?

10:27.828 --> 10:29.095
That's better.

10:30.430 --> 10:32.132
(Balki)
'Jimmy! Jimmy!'

10:33.767 --> 10:36.302
You've got a problem, baby.

10:36.336 --> 10:39.372
You didn't hire a maid,
you hired a mother.

10:39.405 --> 10:42.142
[instrumental music]

10:47.714 --> 10:49.049
[instrumental music]

10:55.055 --> 10:56.322
Wow!

10:56.356 --> 10:58.792
That was some concert, huh?

10:58.825 --> 11:00.293
I just love George Michael.

11:00.326 --> 11:03.029
I think it's so sexy when
someone has two first names.

11:05.966 --> 11:08.902
You know, when he sang
"Careless Whisper," I melted.

11:08.935 --> 11:11.805
Just makes me feel so romantic.

11:15.876 --> 11:19.913
Well, why don't you select
some music to sustain the mood.

11:21.782 --> 11:25.085
And we'll be right back.

11:25.118 --> 11:25.952
Balki.

11:31.457 --> 11:35.996
I think this could be
the greatest night of my life.

11:36.029 --> 11:39.199
Now, when we go back into the
living room, I'll dim the lights

11:39.232 --> 11:41.334
ask Jennifer to dance and then

11:41.367 --> 11:43.136
when I feel the time
is right, I'll do this.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.974
Why would anybody do this?

11:50.777 --> 11:52.846
Because when I do this..

11:52.879 --> 11:54.948
...that means that you will tell

11:54.981 --> 11:57.283
Mary Anne that you want
to go upstairs and see

11:57.317 --> 11:59.886
her "Great Cities of the World"
place mat collection.

12:02.889 --> 12:05.291
I've already seen it.

12:05.325 --> 12:07.227
I was quite disappointed
in Barcelona.

12:08.862 --> 12:11.397
Balki, trust me.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.800
Barcelona is much prettier
this time of year.

12:17.003 --> 12:18.471
[instrumental music on radio]

12:33.854 --> 12:36.089
May I have this dance?

12:36.122 --> 12:38.191
Why, yes, you may.

12:42.863 --> 12:45.999
So, uh, Mary Anne

12:46.032 --> 12:49.169
uh, would you like to

12:49.202 --> 12:51.137
join Cousin Larry and Jennifer?

13:08.989 --> 13:09.923
What..

13:11.892 --> 13:14.561
[music continues]

13:22.335 --> 13:23.403
Ooh!

13:34.447 --> 13:35.982
[fingers snapping]

13:39.119 --> 13:40.987
[fingers snapping]

14:07.047 --> 14:08.114
Wow!

14:14.420 --> 14:18.091
Uh, Mary Anne, why don't you
take Balki upstairs and show him

14:18.124 --> 14:20.527
your "Great Cities of the World"
place mat collection?

14:28.434 --> 14:30.070
Well, okay!

14:33.574 --> 14:34.307
[door opens]

14:37.611 --> 14:39.212
Oh, you're home!

14:40.480 --> 14:42.048
Mrs. Bailey!

14:42.082 --> 14:44.518
‐ Mrs. Bailey.
‐ Yes..

14:44.551 --> 14:46.553
Listen, I‐I want you
to meet our friends.

14:46.587 --> 14:47.554
This is Mary Anne.

14:47.588 --> 14:49.155
‐ Hello, Mary Anne.
‐ Hi.

14:49.189 --> 14:50.924
And, uh, this is Jennifer.

14:50.957 --> 14:52.492
‐ Hello, Jennifer.
‐ Hi.

14:52.526 --> 14:54.294
And, and this,
this is Mrs. Bailey

14:54.327 --> 14:55.495
our new housekeeper.

14:55.529 --> 14:58.431
Mrs. Bailey, what
are you doing here?

14:58.464 --> 15:00.433
I work here.

15:00.466 --> 15:03.537
Oh, honey, this
one's crazy about you.

15:05.438 --> 15:07.440
Uh, listen, Mrs. Bailey

15:07.473 --> 15:11.144
I think you've done
enough work for one day.

15:11.177 --> 15:13.146
Now, why don't you take
the rest of the evening off?

15:13.179 --> 15:16.116
Oh, Larry, that's
so sweet of you.

15:16.149 --> 15:18.184
Well, if I don't have
to fold the clothes

15:18.218 --> 15:20.587
why don't I mix up a batch
of chocolate chip cookies

15:20.621 --> 15:23.323
and then I can get
to know your friends better.

15:23.356 --> 15:27.360
Chocolate chip cookies!
What a great idea!

15:27.393 --> 15:31.097
Yeah, I really think it's,
uh, kind of late for all this.

15:31.131 --> 15:33.333
Yeah, i‐it is late.
We, we better be going.

15:33.366 --> 15:35.368
What? What?
Uh, you're leaving?

15:35.401 --> 15:37.704
Well, Larry, I have to get
up early tomorrow morning

15:37.738 --> 15:39.740
and we've kind of lost the mood.

15:39.773 --> 15:42.408
Oh, no, no, no. We haven't.

15:44.244 --> 15:46.513
Once she's gone,
the lights go down

15:46.547 --> 15:48.615
the music will come up
and I'll find

15:48.649 --> 15:51.117
the mood if it kills me.

15:55.021 --> 15:56.056
Larry, I'll talk
to you tomorrow.

15:56.089 --> 15:59.025
Thanks for a wonderful evening.
Come on, Mary Anne.

15:59.059 --> 16:00.393
Yeah, but‐but, uh, but, but..

16:00.426 --> 16:02.195
I don't understand,
is anybody gonna come

16:02.228 --> 16:04.097
and look at
my place mats or what?

16:07.668 --> 16:09.503
Did your dates leave?

16:09.536 --> 16:11.572
Ye‐e‐es, yes, they did.

16:14.074 --> 16:17.578
O‐oh. I hope I didn't
ruin the evening.

16:17.611 --> 16:21.147
Oh, no, no, Mrs. Bailey.
You didn't ruin anything.

16:21.181 --> 16:22.983
They, they always leave
around this time.

16:26.086 --> 16:28.088
Anyway, we can still have
those chocolate chip cookies.

16:28.121 --> 16:29.790
Aw, of course, we can.

16:29.823 --> 16:31.424
Okay and.. Ah, let me just fold

16:31.457 --> 16:33.594
these and then
I'll mix up a batch.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.563
Here we go.

16:41.802 --> 16:44.705
Alright, Balki. We have
to talk about Mrs. Bailey.

16:46.472 --> 16:48.542
Well, well, you know,
that's a good idea.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.076
Look, it's‐it's midnight

16:50.110 --> 16:52.445
and she's here baking
chocolate chip cookies.

16:52.478 --> 16:55.048
We should give her a raise.

16:55.849 --> 16:58.351
A raise wasn't
what I had in mind.

16:58.384 --> 17:02.088
Look, Balki, I‐I like
Mrs. Bailey as much as anybody

17:02.122 --> 17:04.190
but it's like
living with my mother.

17:04.223 --> 17:06.792
I know it!
It gets better and better!

17:08.161 --> 17:11.164
Mrs. Bailey is driving me crazy.

17:11.196 --> 17:13.199
Cousin, what are
you talking about?

17:13.233 --> 17:15.602
Mrs. Bailey's a wonderful woman

17:15.636 --> 17:17.470
and a terrific housekeeper.

17:17.503 --> 17:20.473
She's everything
we wanted and more.

17:20.507 --> 17:23.844
It's the more that's
driving me crazy.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.746
I‐it's the more
that is always here

17:25.779 --> 17:27.446
when I want to be alone.

17:27.480 --> 17:28.815
It's the more that
always makes sure

17:28.849 --> 17:31.351
I wash my hands before dinner.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.620
And it's the more that ruined

17:33.654 --> 17:34.821
what could have been

17:34.855 --> 17:37.190
the most wonderful night
of my life.

17:40.426 --> 17:42.529
So what are you saying?

17:44.598 --> 17:48.101
I am saying I just wanted
someone who would come in

17:48.134 --> 17:50.170
and clean up a little,
not someone

17:50.203 --> 17:52.673
who would tuck me
in every night.

17:52.706 --> 17:55.108
Balki, I'm going to have
to fire Mrs. Bailey.

17:55.141 --> 17:57.277
(Balki)
'Well, you can kiss
that notion goodbye!'

17:57.310 --> 17:59.112
Mrs. Bailey likes
taking care of us

17:59.145 --> 18:01.247
and I like being taken care of.

18:01.281 --> 18:03.750
So it's two against
one. She stays.

18:03.784 --> 18:07.754
No, Balki, no, I, I should go.

18:07.788 --> 18:10.824
Oh, Mrs. Bailey,
I‐I, I didn't mean, uh..

18:10.857 --> 18:12.593
‐ No, that's alright.
‐ W‐what I, what I meant‐‐

18:12.626 --> 18:14.561
‐ He means he didn't mean it.
‐ No, please, no, please.

18:14.595 --> 18:15.862
‐ Mrs. Bailey, I'm sorry, I..
‐ Please don't do this..

18:15.896 --> 18:19.299
Please, please, don't apologize.

18:19.332 --> 18:21.367
It's just a situation
that didn't work out.

18:23.870 --> 18:26.640
I'm very pleased
to have met you both.

18:26.673 --> 18:29.142
And I'm sure you'll find
someone more suitable.

18:31.812 --> 18:34.447
Please don't,
please don't, don't..

18:36.316 --> 18:39.352
Aah, look, uh, Balki,
believe me that

18:39.385 --> 18:41.254
this is, this is
really not what I had..

18:41.287 --> 18:42.355
[door slams]

18:42.388 --> 18:43.489
...in mind.

18:44.591 --> 18:47.528
[blows]

18:48.929 --> 18:51.865
[instrumental music]

18:59.272 --> 19:01.875
Oh! Hey, buddy.
You're home early.

19:03.409 --> 19:05.546
So how was class?

19:07.981 --> 19:10.416
You know, Balki, there's‐there's

19:10.450 --> 19:11.818
somethin' I wanna tell ya.

19:11.852 --> 19:13.253
Eh, Balki?

19:13.987 --> 19:15.822
Balki?

19:15.856 --> 19:18.525
I think you
should know that‐that..

19:18.559 --> 19:20.226
[sighs]

19:20.260 --> 19:21.962
Okay, it's been three days now.

19:21.995 --> 19:23.797
Balki, how long you
gonna keep this goin'?

19:25.566 --> 19:27.934
Forever or until
you hire Mrs. Bailey back

19:27.968 --> 19:29.335
whichever comes first.

19:30.236 --> 19:31.738
Uh, did you hire her back?

19:31.772 --> 19:33.707
Well, Balki, I'm not gonna
hire Mrs. Bailey back..

19:34.975 --> 19:36.510
[knock on door]

19:41.414 --> 19:42.749
‐ Oh.
‐ Oh, hi, Mrs. Bailey.

19:42.783 --> 19:45.251
‐ Hi, Larry.
‐ Come on in. Sit down.

19:45.285 --> 19:46.352
This is for you and Balki.

19:46.386 --> 19:48.622
Oh, thank you.

19:48.655 --> 19:50.791
Oh, my goodness!

19:50.824 --> 19:54.294
Three days and this place
hasn't fallen apart? Heh, heh.

19:54.327 --> 19:56.897
‐ My, I'm proud of you.
‐ Well, thanks.

19:56.930 --> 20:00.000
Mrs. Bailey! Mrs. Bailey,
you came back!

20:00.033 --> 20:01.768
You came back!

20:01.802 --> 20:03.704
She came back!

20:03.737 --> 20:06.673
I still can't believe
what you boys did for me.

20:06.707 --> 20:08.909
I just had to come back
and say thank you.

20:08.942 --> 20:11.578
Thank us? For what?

20:11.612 --> 20:13.814
Well, we were glad to do it.

20:13.847 --> 20:15.949
Took a little legwork,
but when Balki and I found

20:15.982 --> 20:18.519
that sorority at Northwestern
that needed a housemother

20:18.552 --> 20:21.788
well, we both knew you'd
be perfect for the job.

20:21.822 --> 20:25.391
You were so right.
I've never enjoyed a job more.

20:25.425 --> 20:28.028
But, but, but, don't
you enjoy working for us?

20:28.061 --> 20:31.998
Oh, of course, sweetheart.

20:32.032 --> 20:35.669
But Larry was right.
I, I really don't belong here.

20:35.702 --> 20:37.538
‐ We need you.
‐ No, you don't!

20:37.571 --> 20:39.305
‐ Yes, I do!
‐ No, you don't.

20:39.339 --> 20:41.775
You can take care
of yourself. Heh.

20:41.808 --> 20:46.713
But these college kids, they
really need me. Heh, heh.

20:46.747 --> 20:48.414
Oh, well, I've got to get going

20:48.448 --> 20:50.416
but please, come
and visit me, will you?

20:50.450 --> 20:52.619
‐ Oh. Sure, we will.
‐ Oh, that's great.

20:52.653 --> 20:53.820
Come on, heh, heh.

20:53.854 --> 20:54.855
And enjoy the cake.

20:54.888 --> 20:56.723
Ah. Heh. Heh.

20:56.757 --> 20:58.458
Don't forget now,
come and visit.

20:58.491 --> 20:59.059
‐ Oh, we will.
‐ Will do, will do!

20:59.092 --> 21:01.427
Ooh, ooh, one more thing.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.830
Try to make it a habit
to keep the toilet seat down.

21:05.398 --> 21:06.600
You'll thank me
when you get married.

21:12.706 --> 21:14.608
Well, I'll be snookered.

21:16.076 --> 21:18.579
You, you went out
and, and found Mrs. Bailey

21:18.612 --> 21:20.581
a job that makes her happy.

21:23.083 --> 21:25.285
Oh, Balki, was that you?

21:26.520 --> 21:28.488
Well, I didn't
recognize your voice.

21:28.522 --> 21:30.456
It's been so long
since I heard it.

21:37.664 --> 21:40.500
Uh, heh, cousin

21:40.534 --> 21:42.803
um, I'm sorry.

21:43.704 --> 21:45.872
I feel awful.

21:45.906 --> 21:48.374
You know, for,
for, for three days

21:48.408 --> 21:50.076
I've done nothing

21:50.110 --> 21:51.812
but‐but‐but sit in my bedroom

21:51.845 --> 21:54.648
and be angry at you.

21:54.681 --> 21:56.583
Oh, is that where you were?
I was so worried.

21:56.617 --> 21:58.384
I, I thought you moved out.

22:01.922 --> 22:03.624
You're not gonna
make this easy, are you?

22:03.657 --> 22:04.825
No.

22:06.492 --> 22:08.695
I don't get
many opportunities like this.

22:11.698 --> 22:13.366
[chuckles]

22:14.968 --> 22:19.840
Cousin, I apologize.

22:19.873 --> 22:22.142
Uh, I, I‐I

22:22.175 --> 22:23.744
I can't believe that

22:23.777 --> 22:25.779
I was having bad thoughts about

22:25.812 --> 22:27.013
how selfish you were

22:27.047 --> 22:30.717
when‐when you were out
giving of yourself.

22:30.751 --> 22:32.653
You know, you are a saint.

22:36.189 --> 22:38.424
I'm humbled in your presence.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.429
I, I would be honored to be

22:43.463 --> 22:45.566
the dirt on your shoes.

22:49.770 --> 22:53.406
No, dirt is too
honorable for me.

22:53.439 --> 22:55.976
‐ Yeah.
‐ Mm.

22:56.009 --> 22:57.911
‐ I would be honored to be..
‐ Jo, j.. Okay, okay.

22:57.944 --> 22:59.613
To be the mildew
on your shower curtain.

22:59.646 --> 23:01.915
Yeah, Balki, that's enough.

23:01.948 --> 23:04.017
That, that's good,
that, that's, that's good.

23:04.885 --> 23:06.419
Uhh.

23:06.452 --> 23:09.455
‐ Cousin, I'm sorry.
‐ I forgive you. Uh.

23:11.457 --> 23:12.759
Now, why don't
we have a piece of

23:12.793 --> 23:14.127
Mrs. Bailey's chocolate cake?

23:14.160 --> 23:16.462
‐ Oh, good idea.
‐ Heh, heh, heh.

23:16.496 --> 23:17.964
You want, uh,
real plates or paper?

23:17.998 --> 23:19.099
Well, uh, let me see.

23:19.132 --> 23:20.667
Whose turn is it
to do the dishes?

23:20.701 --> 23:21.968
‐ Yours.
‐ Paper!

23:22.002 --> 23:22.969
Right.

23:23.003 --> 23:25.706
[instrumental music]

23:29.475 --> 23:31.678
[theme music]
