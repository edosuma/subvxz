<i>* Hey *</i>

00:10.385 --> 00:12.220
At some point
I wanna talk to you

00:12.262 --> 00:14.806
if you're open to it.
-You know what?

00:14.848 --> 00:16.808
You've had two months
to reach out to me.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.810
Well, I just want you
to know I love you,

00:18.852 --> 00:21.479
and I'm really, really sorry.
-Leave me alone.

00:21.521 --> 00:25.066
I'm hearing rumors left, right,

00:25.108 --> 00:27.694
-That they exist.
-Yeah.

00:27.736 --> 00:30.947
We need to get to New York
for a pre-trial meeting.

00:30.989 --> 00:33.533
My trial
is seven weeks from today.

00:33.575 --> 00:37.287
I would be lying
if I said I wasn't scared.

00:37.328 --> 00:39.706
Why don't we hurry
and take a quick trip

00:39.748 --> 00:42.625
before Jen goes to New York?
And I was thinking Arizona.

00:42.667 --> 00:44.669
-Scottsdale.
-Oh, my God. I'm in. Let's go.

00:44.711 --> 00:48.048
So, the past keeps showing up
over and over.

00:48.089 --> 00:49.549
'Cause I don't have
a memory of it.

00:49.591 --> 00:52.385
Clearing out this trauma

00:52.427 --> 00:54.512

Have you talked

about colleges

02:23.685 --> 02:25.478
We really gotta

Do you want me
to call the school?

You know

Is that too big? Wait.

02:49.878 --> 02:51.504
Jen?

02:51.546 --> 02:53.173
Hi, Mom.
I'm in the kitchen.

02:53.214 --> 02:55.759
CHARLENE: Oh, okay.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.552
Ooh. How nice.

02:57.594 --> 03:00.305
A keto-friendly charcuterie
snack board for you.

03:00.347 --> 03:02.349
I got your favorite thing
for us to do.

03:02.390 --> 03:03.892
What is that?

03:03.933 --> 03:06.811
-A puzzle.
-Oh, good.

03:06.853 --> 03:10.690
Ever since
the legal situation happened,

03:10.732 --> 03:13.026
my mom is somebody
I lean on a lot.

03:13.068 --> 03:15.403
Let's sit down over here.

03:15.445 --> 03:17.572
The fact that I can be
accused of these things

03:17.614 --> 03:19.908
that I'm innocent of,
it scares me.

03:19.949 --> 03:22.869
I need to know
that I'm gonna be okay,

03:22.911 --> 03:25.288
and she gives me
that reassurance and comfort.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.665
This puzzle's
the North Shore Hawaii.

03:27.707 --> 03:30.585
But a thousand pieces? Really?

03:30.627 --> 03:33.213
Oh, wait, look, here's
three pieces are put together.

03:33.254 --> 03:35.632
Yay! There you go.

03:35.674 --> 03:40.470
So, I had a call with
my lead trial attorney, Priya.

03:40.512 --> 03:42.263
It's getting--
You know, it's getting closer.

03:42.305 --> 03:43.932
Yes.

03:43.973 --> 03:47.977
So yesterday, was like a mock
trial of the prosecution side.

03:48.019 --> 03:50.689
Umm, it was--it was rough.

03:50.730 --> 03:53.900
Because you have to sit there
and not say anything.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.568
-Right, right, right.
-So you have to listen

03:55.610 --> 03:57.195
to all these things
being said about you where

03:57.237 --> 04:00.115
you wanna be like, "No, that's
not true," "No, that's a lie."

04:00.156 --> 04:01.574
-Oh, okay.
-And you...you know?

04:01.616 --> 04:03.910
So I only
stormed out, like, twice.

04:03.952 --> 04:04.994
Oh, that's good.

04:05.036 --> 04:07.080
So I have to fly
to New York next week.

04:07.122 --> 04:08.456
Next week already?

04:08.498 --> 04:11.418
Just for meetings
with the legal team.

04:11.459 --> 04:13.378
How are the boys doing
with all of this, though?

04:13.420 --> 04:18.425
Um...it's been hard.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.510
Sharrieff told me
the other day that...

04:20.552 --> 04:22.137
[voice breaking]
he walked into Omar's room,

04:22.178 --> 04:24.305
and Omar was crying.

04:24.347 --> 04:26.933
He's like, "What's wrong?"
And Omar said,

04:26.975 --> 04:30.145
"I just don't wanna be
without my mom, Dad."

04:30.186 --> 04:31.438
[clicks teeth]

04:35.483 --> 04:37.777
I know--
I know it affects him a lot,

04:37.819 --> 04:40.321
but he just tries to be
super strong around me.

04:41.573 --> 04:43.241
It breaks my heart

04:43.283 --> 04:46.286
knowing that Omar
is worried about me.

04:46.327 --> 04:49.247
I know... [sniffles]

04:49.289 --> 04:51.458
how I would feel
if I was wondering

04:51.499 --> 04:54.044
if my mom would be around.

04:54.085 --> 04:55.879
Because I rely so much on her.

04:57.839 --> 05:00.842
You know, if I didn't have
a great, loving husband...

05:00.884 --> 05:02.635
-Yeah. Yeah.
-...and kids,

05:02.677 --> 05:04.846
Mom, I wouldn't
still be here on this earth.

05:06.723 --> 05:09.059
I could not get up every day

05:09.100 --> 05:12.645
and listen
to all of the negative sh--

05:12.687 --> 05:14.397
that is thrown at me,

05:14.439 --> 05:15.607
and people saying
all this stuff,

05:15.648 --> 05:17.901
people that don't know me.

05:17.942 --> 05:19.819
They want
to just tear you down

05:19.861 --> 05:22.530
until you don't
want to live anymore.

05:28.119 --> 05:31.915
Every single day.
I get bullied every single day,

05:31.956 --> 05:35.126
and then it's Sharrieff's job
to come home... [sniffles]

05:35.168 --> 05:39.089
and try to lift me up this much
so that I don't... [sobbing]

05:39.130 --> 05:42.050
want to ----ing kill myself
and just not be here!

05:42.092 --> 05:43.885
It's too painful!

05:43.927 --> 05:46.429
Every day for a year
I've been dealing with this?

05:46.471 --> 05:51.184
Jen, you know what? Right now
you're...I don't know how to--

05:51.226 --> 05:53.436
Mom, I just am...
telling you.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.063
I know. I know.
But you know what?

05:55.105 --> 05:57.816
I-I don't have answers
for you, other than...

05:57.857 --> 06:00.068
I need you here.

06:03.905 --> 06:06.991
We'll get through
all of this together.

06:09.244 --> 06:12.038
And as much as it might hurt
the boys and everything else,

06:12.080 --> 06:14.624
just think what it would be like
if you weren't here.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.878
But, Mom, this--
that's what makes me mad.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.964
My--no one has--
I haven't done anything.

06:21.006 --> 06:22.882
And my family
doesn't deserve this.

06:22.924 --> 06:27.012
You don't deserve it.
[exhales deeply]

06:27.053 --> 06:29.514
You know what? That's okay.
We're strong people.

06:29.556 --> 06:32.392
We'll get through this together.

06:32.434 --> 06:34.185
[exhales deeply]

06:37.897 --> 06:38.815

-[chuckles]

08:12.242 --> 08:14.411
In all the years
that I've known Meredith,

08:14.452 --> 08:17.497
she's never shown any interest
in coming over to my house

08:17.539 --> 08:20.000
and spending time with me.

08:20.041 --> 08:21.960
-You wanna sit right here?
-Sure.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.879
But since her recent
falling out with Lisa,

08:24.921 --> 08:26.631
it seems she has time for me.

wrap yourself up in that.

Tell me.

08:37.892 --> 08:41.354
It's been a little--
a little crazy, right?

08:41.396 --> 08:43.481
Yeah. I mean, I feel like

08:43.523 --> 08:45.734
I need to ask you
how you're doing.

08:45.775 --> 08:48.611
I'm okay, you know?

08:48.653 --> 08:51.614
Did you have fun at the party?

08:51.656 --> 08:56.286
Yeah. I mean...
it was awkward with Lisa.

08:56.327 --> 09:00.457
You know? It's just--
there's no, like,

09:00.498 --> 09:01.875
practice what you
preach with her.

09:01.916 --> 09:04.336
She's so, just, hypocritical.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.046
And then she's always
telling everyone else

09:06.087 --> 09:07.714
that they're hypocritical,
and they're wrong,

09:07.756 --> 09:09.424
and they're this,
and they're that.

09:09.466 --> 09:12.886
She has bad-mouthed every
single one of us in our circle.

09:12.927 --> 09:14.679
I don't wanna lose
our liquor license

09:14.721 --> 09:17.766

in their basement

09:17.807 --> 09:20.560

09:20.602 --> 09:23.104
Well, I used to hear stories.
I think she was, like,

09:23.146 --> 09:27.067
the one that was, like,
"Honor Code what?"

09:27.108 --> 09:32.155
She was meeting up with somebody
other than her family.

09:33.698 --> 09:35.825
----ing piece
of sh-- garbage whore.

09:40.372 --> 09:42.374
You say to yourself,
"Whoa, why are you so busy

trying to put everyone else down
in this way

09:45.543 --> 09:48.213

09:51.800 --> 09:54.594
Well, what have you heard?

09:54.636 --> 09:58.264
Jen just made reference
to there having been affairs.

09:58.306 --> 09:59.766
What do <i>you</i>know?

10:02.143 --> 10:06.398
[crunching]

10:06.439 --> 10:08.692
I just heard that she was,
you know, doing favors

10:08.733 --> 10:11.111
to help get places
to pick up Vida Tequila.

10:11.152 --> 10:12.862
I have no idea
if it's true or false.

10:12.904 --> 10:16.991
It sounds absurd to me.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.245
I know that sounds absurd,
but it's really not,

10:20.286 --> 10:24.666
because I've actually
heard the same thing.

10:24.708 --> 10:26.876
-You have heard that?
-Yes.

10:26.918 --> 10:30.422
I have a-a friend, and...

10:30.463 --> 10:32.298
it's a mutual friend of Lisa's,

10:32.340 --> 10:35.010
and he's very wealthy
and very well known in Utah.

10:35.051 --> 10:40.015
And I've heard that
she slept with him to sway him

10:40.056 --> 10:42.934
to invest in...her businesses.

10:44.352 --> 10:48.023
I don't know, but I feel bad
talking behind her back.

10:49.524 --> 10:51.985
The last thing I want to do
is sit and talk about Lisa

10:52.027 --> 10:54.612
behind her back.
I'm just trying to understand,

10:54.654 --> 10:57.032
like, how did we
even get here?

10:57.073 --> 11:02.328
I don't know, but during my last
healing session with Megan,

11:02.370 --> 11:06.332
my energy healer,
I was able to connect...

11:06.374 --> 11:07.709
...to Lisa.

11:07.751 --> 11:10.670
It's still stuck.
What's coming to mind?

11:10.712 --> 11:12.797
Um, actually, it's Lisa.

11:12.839 --> 11:16.509
I always see her
as, like, big, mean, nasty.

11:16.551 --> 11:18.678
But I just saw her
as, like, a scared little girl.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.221
-The inner child.
-Yeah.

11:22.390 --> 11:23.558
Wow.

11:23.600 --> 11:28.438
When I felt her and saw her,
I realized...

11:28.480 --> 11:33.610
that maybe there
is something there that...

11:33.651 --> 11:36.112
is, like,
worth fighting for.

11:36.154 --> 11:37.405
Wow.

11:39.032 --> 11:42.160
I hear you.
I just don't know, um...

11:42.202 --> 11:45.163
At this point,
in my view, like...

11:45.205 --> 11:47.957
why am I bothering?
You know?

11:47.999 --> 11:51.044
Yeah. But hear me out.
We have this trip coming up.

11:51.086 --> 11:54.047
I know that Jen,
you know, she needs us.

11:54.089 --> 11:57.801
And I am hijacking
all the bulls---.

11:57.842 --> 11:59.344
It really is
gonna be about healing.

11:59.386 --> 12:03.181
-[laughs] Okay, for real?
-For reals.

12:03.223 --> 12:07.268
We can do this.
We can come together.

12:07.310 --> 12:09.437
Okay.

12:09.479 --> 12:10.730
<i>Coming up...</i>

12:10.772 --> 12:12.565
I used to feel like I was
a safe space for you,

12:12.607 --> 12:14.109
and I'm sorry.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.902
You are not a safe space, Lisa.

12:25.161 --> 12:35.088
***

12:39.843 --> 12:41.845
LISA: Ooh. Oh.
Are you kidding me?

12:41.886 --> 12:44.014
Are you kidding me?

12:44.055 --> 12:47.684
Yeah, that extra foot you grew
is coming in handy.

12:47.726 --> 12:49.811
You ready
for some competition?

12:49.853 --> 12:51.813
Uh-huh.

12:51.855 --> 12:54.482
Ooh! Yikes. Maybe not.

12:57.152 --> 12:59.612
Come on. Try and take it away.

12:59.654 --> 13:00.989
Ooh. [laughs]

13:01.031 --> 13:03.283
Let me see you do
a little layup.

13:03.324 --> 13:06.953
[laughing]

13:08.163 --> 13:11.916
How's everything going
with your SATs?

13:11.958 --> 13:14.002
Oh! [laughing]

13:14.044 --> 13:16.838
Very mid-tier.
I have to re-take 'em.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.423
What are you
thinking about with college?

13:18.465 --> 13:20.133
I don't know.

13:22.844 --> 13:25.138
-[rim clatters]
-Ooh.

13:25.180 --> 13:27.223
Like you still wanna go, or no?

13:27.265 --> 13:29.142
-I don't know.
-You don't know?

13:29.184 --> 13:31.895
Like if you don't go
to college, what would you do?

13:31.936 --> 13:34.272
I don't know.
Probably end up richer

13:34.314 --> 13:36.191
than if I went to college.

13:36.232 --> 13:40.820
So walk me through this logic.
Whoa.

13:40.862 --> 13:43.406
So, like, walk me
through your logic.

13:46.117 --> 13:47.702
Killer company.

13:47.744 --> 13:51.206
So if I just kill it with that,
then I can start other companies

13:51.247 --> 13:55.251
and just become successful.

13:55.293 --> 13:58.672
LISA: Jack has always been
a straight-A student.

13:58.713 --> 14:02.759
Like, always the leader
in his class, always involved.

14:02.801 --> 14:05.637
And so this whole thing is,
like, surprising me.

14:05.679 --> 14:08.973
I'm, like, why are you
all of a sudden so emphatic

14:09.015 --> 14:11.184
about not going to college?

14:11.226 --> 14:13.978
You know,
the way my dad raised me,

14:14.020 --> 14:16.481
like I graduated
from high school when I was 17.

14:16.523 --> 14:19.526
And my dad was like, "You're on
your own now, basically."

14:19.567 --> 14:21.236
I love that you have
your own business,

14:21.277 --> 14:22.862
but you have your own business

14:22.904 --> 14:24.155
'cause Daddy and I
worked hard, too.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.990
Uh, this is Fresh Wolf.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.200
It's a company
me and my brother started.

14:27.242 --> 14:29.744
Uh, we have
a lot of different products.

14:29.786 --> 14:30.620
Shh. [whispers indistinctly]

14:30.662 --> 14:31.913
Like shampoo, conditioner,

14:31.955 --> 14:33.790
pomade, hair wax,
and beard oil.

14:33.832 --> 14:35.834
-I love it.
-That was good.

14:36.835 --> 14:39.254
You know, without those kind of
connections, it kind of sucks.

14:39.295 --> 14:43.508
And, like,
you need to think about that.

14:43.550 --> 14:46.678
Like, not many people your age
have what you have.

14:46.720 --> 14:51.057
But it's also because
I went to college, you know?

14:53.435 --> 14:56.312
Fudge college, honestly.
There's no need for it.

14:58.440 --> 15:01.234
You know, I don't even know
what's happening right now.

15:01.276 --> 15:03.278
I don't know
if I pushed Jack to this point

15:03.319 --> 15:05.363
because I was
raised so independently.

15:05.405 --> 15:08.116
I'm one of six kids,
and I had to be grown-up.

15:08.158 --> 15:12.078
And I think with that,
I have a very...

15:12.120 --> 15:14.914
high set
of expectations on myself.

15:14.956 --> 15:19.753
And I think I've naturally just
imparted those on my children.

15:19.794 --> 15:21.629
Listen, this is
supposed to be conversational.

15:21.671 --> 15:22.964
You're taking it like--

15:23.006 --> 15:26.259
I'm just telling you
my experience. Just listen.

15:26.301 --> 15:29.679
College is where they go
to build machines, not humans.

15:29.721 --> 15:33.099
You know, it's, like,
oh, my gosh, did I create this?

15:33.141 --> 15:36.269
-Okay. Take a break for a sec.
-No.

15:36.311 --> 15:39.564
-Talk. I'm all ears.
-No, it just hurt my feelings--

15:39.606 --> 15:42.317
I'm trying to, like, understand
where you're coming from.

15:42.359 --> 15:44.152
It's like--seems like
you're giving attitude,

15:44.194 --> 15:46.696
like, "I know everything,
I understand everything."

15:46.738 --> 15:48.948
You don't. You have me
and Dad supporting you.

15:48.990 --> 15:50.825
Like, when you can
get to a point

15:50.867 --> 15:53.453
where you're funding your
own business all by yourself,

15:53.495 --> 15:55.288
and I don't
have to invest any money,

15:55.330 --> 15:57.207
and your dad doesn't
have to invest any money,

15:57.248 --> 15:59.959
then you can be like,
"I got this. I'm amazing."

16:00.001 --> 16:03.171
You can't do that now.
That's not how it works, Jack.

16:03.213 --> 16:06.174
Okay.
Well, I'm going inside.

16:07.217 --> 16:19.979
***

16:20.021 --> 16:21.856
-WHITNEY: Justin.
-JUSTIN: Yeah?

16:21.898 --> 16:23.191
WHITNEY: Come here.

16:24.859 --> 16:26.486
What's up?

16:26.528 --> 16:28.446
I'm gonna fill up your glass.

16:30.990 --> 16:34.119
What's going on?

16:34.160 --> 16:35.662
Are you okay?

16:35.704 --> 16:37.163
No.

16:38.373 --> 16:41.459
I just got
off the phone with Will.

16:46.006 --> 16:48.299
[bottle clatters]

16:48.341 --> 16:51.720
-I need to talk to you.
-What's up? Are you okay?

16:59.185 --> 17:00.645
[sniffles]

17:03.523 --> 17:05.108
[sniffles]

17:05.150 --> 17:06.484
Uh-oh.

17:08.403 --> 17:11.781
Babe, what's going on?

17:11.823 --> 17:13.700
[sniffles]

17:17.245 --> 17:19.372
I'm sorry. I just don't know
where to start.

17:19.414 --> 17:21.374
-It's so much.
-So, just tell me.

17:21.416 --> 17:23.168
Start from what--
Like, what happened?

17:23.209 --> 17:25.503
Like, what--
What did he say to you?

17:26.755 --> 17:28.798
I was just trying
to, like, plan something

17:28.840 --> 17:31.009
to get together with him and...
[sniffles]

17:31.051 --> 17:34.220
And...

17:34.262 --> 17:36.514
I just told him
how I've been doing,

17:36.556 --> 17:39.684
like, all this therapy
and healing work,

17:39.726 --> 17:43.646
and he shared with me
that he was doing EDMR.

17:43.688 --> 17:45.440
What's EDMR?

17:45.482 --> 17:48.526
It's, like, a form of,
like, memory recall

17:48.568 --> 17:53.073
based on
hand-eye coordination.

17:53.114 --> 17:54.783
[sighs]

17:56.076 --> 17:58.620
Like, you know how I always,
like, tell you that I...

17:58.661 --> 18:06.378
[sniffles] I don't remember
details of my childhood?

18:06.419 --> 18:09.589
-[sniffles]
-Yeah.

18:09.631 --> 18:13.802
[voice breaking] Will told me...
[sobbing]

18:13.843 --> 18:20.058
...that he...like, through
his EDMR therapy, remembers...

18:20.100 --> 18:22.227
[sobbing]

18:22.268 --> 18:27.232
...that I was actually abused
and I just don't remember it.

18:27.273 --> 18:29.609
Oh, my gosh.

18:29.651 --> 18:30.735
[sniffles]

18:33.780 --> 18:35.865
A lot of my childhood
I have blocked out,

18:35.907 --> 18:39.452
and as I've been
on this healing journey...

18:39.494 --> 18:42.247
I have relied
on other family members

18:42.288 --> 18:45.208
to help fill in the pieces.

18:45.250 --> 18:49.504
Because as much healing that
I do, there are certain things

18:49.546 --> 18:52.841
that you cannot remove
from a child's brain.

18:54.843 --> 18:57.429
[sobbing]

18:57.470 --> 18:59.764
All of those memories
that I have suppressed

18:59.806 --> 19:01.558
are all
flowing through me now.

19:01.599 --> 19:04.352
And there's just so much pain.

19:04.394 --> 19:07.731
I'm just feeling
so much pain and so much anger.

19:07.772 --> 19:12.485
And it just feels
very overwhelming...

19:12.527 --> 19:14.863
to take
this all on right now.

19:18.158 --> 19:22.579
[voice breaking] And so...
I don't even know if I, like,

19:22.620 --> 19:28.251
am comfortable saying it,
but...

19:28.293 --> 19:30.628
But when--when...

19:30.670 --> 19:34.841
when Megan came to our house...
-Uh-huh.

19:34.883 --> 19:39.012
And we--we saged the house,
every bathroom she went in,

19:39.054 --> 19:42.640
she was like, "There's so many
demons in your bathrooms.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.852
I don't know what it is about
with you and bathrooms," like...

19:48.605 --> 19:51.733
Did Will say something that
gave you some clarity on that?

19:54.861 --> 19:58.865
So ----ed up.
It's so ----ed up.

19:58.907 --> 20:02.535
'Cause I'm still so scared...
[sniffles]

20:02.577 --> 20:06.790
...to say what I know
and what I remember.

20:06.831 --> 20:08.208
Babe, I'm so sorry.

20:08.249 --> 20:10.585
[sniffles]

20:10.627 --> 20:13.213
This is so ----ed up.

20:13.254 --> 20:17.842
Like...like,
but do you still love me?

20:17.884 --> 20:19.844
Of course I do, babe.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.680
[sniffles]

20:21.721 --> 20:23.264
-Of course.
-[Whitney sniffles]

20:23.306 --> 20:28.561
***

20:28.603 --> 20:32.357
As--As much as I
often question if I--

20:32.399 --> 20:34.401
if it would be easier
to not know

20:34.442 --> 20:36.986
and un-see it
and un-remember it...

20:37.028 --> 20:41.741
I don't think so.
Like, I think that... [sniffles]

20:41.783 --> 20:44.035
I think that
you have to allow yourself

20:44.077 --> 20:48.248
to go through it
and acknowledge it... [sniffles]

20:48.289 --> 20:52.210
and survive it.

20:52.252 --> 20:56.423
There is
a trauma hidden deep...

20:56.464 --> 20:59.759
deep inside of me,
and I know that.

20:59.801 --> 21:04.222
I know you're obvious--obviously
able to block out things

21:04.264 --> 21:07.892
that were hurtful to you.

21:07.934 --> 21:10.270
And I know that's a big reason
why you're going through

21:10.311 --> 21:16.026
what you're
going through right now.

21:16.067 --> 21:18.862
But you definitely
can't take that on yourself.

21:34.085 --> 21:37.005

21:42.302 --> 21:45.722
Can you go grab me that stuff
over there and hand it to me?

21:45.764 --> 21:49.517
I mean that--
All of that I'm packing.

21:49.559 --> 21:53.146
-What is this?
-[laughter]

21:53.188 --> 21:56.524
Listen, Jen said
she wanted a lingerie party.

21:56.566 --> 21:58.902
I do not want to let Jen down,
ever.

21:58.943 --> 22:01.071
-GEORGIA: It's true.
-ANNABELLE: Yeah, exactly.

22:11.873 --> 22:13.833
What are you doing?
What is that even for?

22:13.875 --> 22:15.543
We're going to plan
a little party.

22:15.585 --> 22:17.128
It's gonna be called

22:17.170 --> 22:18.880
the Garbage Trash Whore
Lingerie Party.

22:18.922 --> 22:21.257
-That's the theme?
-Yes.

22:21.299 --> 22:22.842
Please don't. That's not good.

22:22.884 --> 22:26.054
I'll just say GTW.
[chants] GTW.

22:26.096 --> 22:34.771

22:34.813 --> 22:37.524
Are you sure you should be
going on this trip?

22:37.565 --> 22:40.151
Yeah, I mean,
it's not the best timing,

22:40.193 --> 22:43.405
but--but for me, what's
really calling me to Arizona,

22:43.446 --> 22:46.825
is, like,
me just trying to...

22:46.866 --> 22:48.785
heal and connect with my family

22:48.827 --> 22:51.621
and move on
from all of this past trauma.

22:51.663 --> 22:53.415
After I got
the phone call from Will,

22:53.456 --> 22:56.042
I called
my other half brother, Curtis.

22:56.084 --> 22:58.628
And I told him I was
supposed to be coming to Arizona

22:58.670 --> 23:00.422
on a girls trip,
but I didn't know

23:00.463 --> 23:03.466
if I was strong enough to go.
But he said, "No, come,

23:03.508 --> 23:05.677
and you need to see
me and your sister.

23:05.719 --> 23:07.637
We got you.
We're going to be here for you.

23:07.679 --> 23:09.014
We'll help you
get through this."

23:09.055 --> 23:11.641
It feels right,
and it feels good

23:11.683 --> 23:14.602
to be, like,
connecting with them.

How many bags do you have?

23:34.456 --> 23:36.458
-I have too many.
-Oh, you do.

We're going to miss our flight.

-Hey. Are you good?
-Yeah, we're good.

23:44.674 --> 23:47.260
I just have to go backwards.

23:47.302 --> 23:50.180
WHITNEY: I invited Lisa
to fly ahead with me,

23:50.221 --> 23:52.390
because the thought
of the five of us

23:52.432 --> 23:53.808
flying together right now,

23:53.850 --> 23:55.894
I think I'd have
a full-on panic attack,

23:55.935 --> 23:59.481
just trying to make sure
that no one got in a fight,

23:59.522 --> 24:01.316
specifically Lisa and Meredith.

Thank you, sir.

Well, I think the other girls,

24:14.537 --> 24:15.997
their flight gets in
in a little bit.

24:16.039 --> 24:17.707
-LISA: Oh, really?
-Yeah.

-Okay.
-They're not too far behind us.

HEATHER:
I love Arizona in the winter.

24:28.468 --> 24:29.719
[laughs]

24:32.889 --> 24:34.808
It's the redheaded stepchild
of Utah.

24:34.849 --> 24:37.811
It's just Utah, warmer,
and with more white people,

24:37.852 --> 24:40.146
if that's even
humanly possible.

24:40.188 --> 24:42.524
I wouldn't mind
St. Tropez or Bali

24:42.565 --> 24:45.193
or the Maldives,
something like that.

24:45.235 --> 24:48.530
Well, I don't think
Jen can leave the country.

-WHITNEY: Oh, they have

25:08.383 --> 25:11.636
cocktails waiting for us.
That's amazing.

-Hi! Lisa.

-Lisa?
-So nice to meet you.

Ooh, I would love one.
Thank you.

-Cheers.
-Yay!

25:28.945 --> 25:30.363
-Are you ready to see the house?
-Yes.

one of Mary's rentals?

25:39.164 --> 25:40.415
[laughter]

25:40.457 --> 25:42.083
Walking into this house,

25:42.125 --> 25:46.004
I feel like we've stepped foot
into Mary Cosby's grand foyer.

25:46.046 --> 25:48.757
[lively classical music playing]

25:48.798 --> 25:51.384
It's almost like
Mary is still with us.

Oh, is that all by itself?

25:59.392 --> 26:01.353
-It is.
-Oh. Oh!

26:01.394 --> 26:04.773
-WHITNEY: Wow.
-LISA: Just like "Dynasty."

26:04.814 --> 26:06.483
It literally looks
like Barbie's dream house...

26:06.524 --> 26:08.943
circa 1984.

26:08.985 --> 26:11.112
The house
is massively outdated,

26:11.154 --> 26:14.115
but I do think
it's a good party house.

26:14.157 --> 26:15.617
So the rest
of the house is that way.

26:15.658 --> 26:17.285
I'm gonna
let you guys enjoy it.

26:17.327 --> 26:18.453
Thank you!

kind of miss Mary.

I love you both,

26:26.711 --> 26:28.129
and maybe it's at the point now
where there can be

26:28.171 --> 26:30.715
a conversation,
and she can hear you.

26:30.757 --> 26:32.509
Have you
talked to her about it?

you and Meredith's fight.

my swimsuit on.

We need some sun.

26:47.691 --> 26:49.693
LISA: We never get to spend
one-on-one time together.

26:49.734 --> 26:51.361

Drink from it.

27:10.922 --> 27:12.465
You're the good time girl.

27:12.507 --> 27:14.759
Sorry, Heather.
You've been replaced.

27:14.801 --> 27:16.553
[laughs]

27:16.594 --> 27:19.389
Well, thanks for inviting me
to come in early with you.

27:19.431 --> 27:22.058
Yeah, thanks for coming.

27:22.100 --> 27:24.144
I think it's been good.
Like, I feel like I'm getting

27:24.185 --> 27:26.187
to understand you better,
and I love that.

27:26.229 --> 27:28.148
Well, and it helps me, too,

27:28.189 --> 27:30.191
'cause I started this,
like, path of healing.

27:30.233 --> 27:33.820
I'll share with you. I, like--
I don't remember my childhood.

27:33.862 --> 27:35.405
-You blocked it out?
-I blocked it out.

27:37.407 --> 27:42.078
And it goes--
it goes pretty deep.

27:42.120 --> 27:45.040
I started
doing this energy work,

27:45.081 --> 27:48.877
and, like, I'm just starting
to have memories.

27:50.545 --> 27:54.799
I'm gonna be honest, it's, like,
really hard for me...

27:54.841 --> 27:56.843
to talk about it right now.

27:56.885 --> 27:59.637
But it's just...Sorry.

27:59.679 --> 28:01.848
It's okay.

28:01.890 --> 28:05.602
My trauma is pretty
intense for me right now,

28:05.643 --> 28:09.272
and is just so much to process
and so much to take in.

28:09.314 --> 28:11.274
And right now,
I'm just not feeling

28:11.316 --> 28:13.943
like it's something
I'm comfortable sharing.

28:13.985 --> 28:15.487
When you say
you block out things,

28:15.528 --> 28:17.238
like, I don't
necessarily block out things,

28:17.280 --> 28:19.115
but I remember things
where I'm like,

28:19.157 --> 28:20.992
"That was stressful for me."

28:21.034 --> 28:23.953
My sister and I were talking
so much about, like,

28:23.995 --> 28:25.705
childhood traumas.

28:25.747 --> 28:29.542
My parents were little kids
raising little kids.

28:29.584 --> 28:32.128
I'm the middle child,
but I assumed

28:32.170 --> 28:34.297
everything
for all of my sisters.

28:34.339 --> 28:36.549
I, like,
was the one to do, like,

28:36.591 --> 28:38.009
even my little sister's hair,

28:38.051 --> 28:38.968
like, every morning
before school.

28:39.010 --> 28:41.429
Like, my parents both worked.

28:41.471 --> 28:44.182
And, like, I got three
younger kids ready for school.

28:44.224 --> 28:46.142
I've been an adult
my whole life.

28:46.184 --> 28:49.979
You know, when I
started college, my dad was 39.

28:50.021 --> 28:52.482
He had
two other kids in college,

28:52.524 --> 28:55.318
had already funded
two missions,

28:55.360 --> 28:57.696
and had three
younger kids still in school.

28:57.737 --> 28:59.572
We just knew
what we had to do

28:59.614 --> 29:02.283
to support our parents.
Like, we just knew.

29:02.325 --> 29:04.411
So we started
to lean on each other.

29:04.452 --> 29:07.163
And when anything
goes wrong for any of us,

29:07.205 --> 29:08.498
we are there for each other.

29:08.540 --> 29:11.626
And, like, I'm very close
with all of my siblings.

29:11.668 --> 29:13.837
And so for me, like,
like, you know, when I say,

29:13.878 --> 29:15.296
like, "Oh, I love you
like my sister,"

29:15.338 --> 29:17.465
that's a big deal to me.
-Yeah.

29:17.507 --> 29:20.176
Because I'm so used
to having girls around me,

29:20.218 --> 29:22.679
but not everybody
loves me the same way back,

29:22.721 --> 29:24.180
and I'm realizing that.

29:24.222 --> 29:27.517
Like, for example,
like, I feel, like,

29:27.559 --> 29:31.021
even with Meredith,
I was definitely more invested

29:31.062 --> 29:33.773
and in love with the idea
of being, like,

29:33.815 --> 29:37.694
Meredith's best friend,
like her sister and it's...

29:37.736 --> 29:40.655
It wasn't--it wasn't
what I thought it was.

29:40.697 --> 29:43.033
I was a great friend
of Meredith for 10 years.

29:43.074 --> 29:45.285
And it was, like, my one mistake

29:45.326 --> 29:47.454
made her feel like,
"You're a horrible person.

29:47.495 --> 29:49.330
You haven't been my friend
for 10 years."

29:49.372 --> 29:50.749
And, like, that's bullsh--.

29:50.790 --> 29:52.709
That is bullsh--.

29:52.751 --> 29:54.419
I-I love you both.

29:54.461 --> 29:56.880
And I-I think
that you both share

29:56.921 --> 29:59.758
very similar feelings on it

29:59.799 --> 30:02.385
for different reasons
and different causes.

30:02.427 --> 30:04.262
And maybe it's at the point now
where there can be

30:04.304 --> 30:06.139
a conversation
and she can hear you.

30:06.181 --> 30:08.058
Have you talked to her about it?

30:08.099 --> 30:11.394

30:11.436 --> 30:14.731
Yes.

Zack the snack. Thank you.

30:31.373 --> 30:33.625
You guys, this is awesome!

30:33.667 --> 30:37.212
Look at the view.

30:37.253 --> 30:39.255
And how did you feel
based on your conversation?

30:39.297 --> 30:42.425
I think that this is you and
Meredith's fight and battle.

30:42.467 --> 30:43.802
-Yeah, but how did you--
-I don't want to get--

30:43.843 --> 30:45.470
How I feel? I feel like...

30:46.930 --> 30:48.264
Mm-hmm.

30:48.306 --> 30:49.891
-Okay.
-Wow.

30:49.933 --> 30:52.143
-Yeah.
-Whitney Rose did this.

30:52.185 --> 30:54.187
[laughs]
Whitney Rose done right.

30:54.229 --> 30:55.855
Yeah, this is what I call
a girls trip, okay?

30:55.897 --> 30:57.649
Look at them out by the pool.

30:57.691 --> 31:02.737
I've forgiven myself,
and I can't control what she--

31:02.779 --> 31:05.615
if she forgives me,
but I do know, like,

31:05.657 --> 31:07.283
if there's a path
for resolution, like,

31:07.325 --> 31:10.328
I'll be on it with her
if she wants that.

31:10.370 --> 31:13.289
But she has to want that.
It's not up to me at this point.

31:13.331 --> 31:15.458
But I can't
wallow in self-hatred,

31:15.500 --> 31:17.794
and I'm not gonna
slit my wrists for anybody

31:17.836 --> 31:19.295
at this stage in my life.

31:19.337 --> 31:22.007
Like, I said sorry four times.
If they can't forgive me,

31:22.048 --> 31:24.175
there's nothing
I can do about it.

31:26.302 --> 31:27.637
-Um...
-What's up?!

31:27.679 --> 31:29.222

-What is this?
-Fire in the hole.

31:32.559 --> 31:35.645
Meredith has been just picking
flowers the whole afternoon.

31:35.687 --> 31:37.605
You brought me
a bouquet of flowers.

31:37.647 --> 31:38.857
-A cock?
-Sangria.

31:38.898 --> 31:42.986
Sangria, and a half-drank
bottle of Fireball.

31:43.028 --> 31:44.946
I did not drink the Fireball.

31:44.988 --> 31:46.656
This is Meredith's.

This is Meredith's.

I do wear glasses.
I don't have 'em on right now.

32:31.326 --> 32:33.328
But I can definitely see

32:33.370 --> 32:35.455
that Meredith
does not want to talk to me,

32:35.497 --> 32:38.833
and I don't want
to push myself on her.

32:38.875 --> 32:41.920
I missed you! [laughing]

32:41.961 --> 32:45.715
It's definitely very awkward
between Lisa and Meredith.

32:45.757 --> 32:47.258
I didn't
expect them to have, like,

32:47.300 --> 32:48.885
a warm welcome with each other,

32:48.927 --> 32:51.805
but I expected something,
like at least a hello.

32:51.846 --> 32:53.515
It's okay. It's fine.

32:56.184 --> 32:57.977
No.

32:58.019 --> 32:59.896
HEATHER: We looked for Kit Kats
for you and Sugar Babies.

32:59.938 --> 33:01.564
All I could find were
Hot Tamales and Milk Duds.

33:01.606 --> 33:03.274
-They were out?
-But they were out.

33:03.316 --> 33:04.943

they're out?

33:04.984 --> 33:07.237
-Wow!
-Oh, my gosh!

We haven't seen the kitchen!
This is awesome!

33:10.323 --> 33:11.741
Yeah,
so I'll give you the rundown.

33:11.783 --> 33:13.493
We have a shaman coming,

33:13.535 --> 33:16.413
and she recommended
not drinking.

33:16.454 --> 33:18.707
-Yeah.
-Did you explain to her

33:18.748 --> 33:20.542
a little bit
about our background?

33:20.583 --> 33:22.460
Listen.
This is my third attempt

33:22.502 --> 33:25.839
at doing some sort of healing
for--for all of you.

33:25.880 --> 33:27.674
If this one doesn't work,
I'm retiring.

33:27.716 --> 33:31.594
WOMAN: Who doesn't trust Jen?
Raise your hand.

33:31.636 --> 33:33.096
Okay.

33:33.138 --> 33:37.058
Hey, we have to go.

33:37.100 --> 33:40.645
Like, I-I went out of my way
to put this together and...

33:40.687 --> 33:43.440
but we don't have light.
We only have sunlight.

33:43.481 --> 33:47.485
Thank you for, like, indulging
me on my journey to heal.

33:47.527 --> 33:51.531
And I know that Jen
needs us now more than ever.

33:51.573 --> 33:54.367
I just wanted
a girls trip getaway for Jen

33:54.409 --> 33:56.870
to come together
and to spend time

33:56.911 --> 33:59.164
and just show you
our love and support for you.

33:59.205 --> 34:01.332
[voice breaking]
I wasn't expecting this.

34:01.374 --> 34:03.001
[whispers] Got you.

34:03.043 --> 34:08.631
And I really need it now
more than ever, so thank you.

34:08.673 --> 34:12.135
It's times like these
that you really see

34:12.177 --> 34:13.678
who shows up for you.

34:13.720 --> 34:17.265
[sniffles] It means a lot.
Thank you, you guys.

34:17.307 --> 34:19.934
These four women--
they've shown up for me,

34:19.976 --> 34:24.022
and I'm very, very grateful.

34:24.064 --> 34:26.358
This is a beautiful home.
I'm thrilled to be here.

34:26.399 --> 34:27.484
I'm thrilled to be here
with all of you.

34:27.525 --> 34:28.985
-Yeah.
-I'm glad everybody came.

34:29.027 --> 34:31.654
-MEREDITH: Thank you, Whitney.
-Thank you so much.

34:31.696 --> 34:35.158
But with that said,
I pre-selected the rooms.

34:35.200 --> 34:38.578
I just wanted to avoid the
headache and all of the drama.

34:38.620 --> 34:41.956
We'll just set it up
as you, me, Heather.

34:41.998 --> 34:44.000
-Heather, Mer?
-Heather, Mer, and Jen.

34:44.042 --> 34:46.461
There's only two things that
I need to make sure happen.

34:46.503 --> 34:47.879
Meredith's on one end
of the house,

34:47.921 --> 34:49.589
and Lisa's
on the other end of the house.

34:49.631 --> 34:54.052
We decided
to give you the master.

34:54.094 --> 34:57.472
Oh, my gosh. [squealing]

34:57.514 --> 35:00.850
HEATHER: She keeps getting
the best room every time!

35:00.892 --> 35:02.727
Ever since the arrest,
all I know

35:02.769 --> 35:04.688
is I keep getting
the master bedroom.

35:04.729 --> 35:07.357
Wait till you see the bathroom.
We're all gonna be getting ready

35:07.399 --> 35:08.608
in here, high school style.
-Oh, what?

35:08.650 --> 35:10.902
-Are you ready?
-You guys...

35:10.944 --> 35:12.737
No, this is literally
Barbie dream shower.

35:12.779 --> 35:16.074
I mean, maybe this is one area
that's working out for me.

35:16.116 --> 35:17.951
Heather Gay, this is your room.

35:17.992 --> 35:19.411
Your gift is there.

35:19.452 --> 35:21.246
-Aw.
-HEATHER: Can I open it?

35:21.287 --> 35:23.081
-Bring it to Meredith's room.
-Okay.

35:23.123 --> 35:24.457
I hate--I never get presents.

35:24.499 --> 35:26.710
And yours is
indoor/outdoor concept.

35:26.751 --> 35:28.169
-You have a patio.
-MEREDITH: I love it.

35:28.211 --> 35:29.337
HEATHER:
So can we open my gift?

35:29.379 --> 35:30.588
Yeah, open it.

35:30.630 --> 35:32.340
-Oh!
-What?!

35:32.382 --> 35:33.466
LISA: What is it?

35:33.508 --> 35:36.636
"Be you, stay wild."
I love this!

35:36.678 --> 35:38.596
-These are so cute, Whitney.
-Yeah, matching pajamas

35:38.638 --> 35:40.265
with your little initials
and some slippers.

35:40.306 --> 35:42.225
-How cute.
-Look at that! I love it.

35:42.267 --> 35:44.019
Unpack. Get dressed.

35:44.060 --> 35:47.355
You can wear, like,
a Boho chic dress, flowy dress.

35:47.397 --> 35:49.024
Just something
you can sit comfortably in.

35:49.065 --> 35:52.110
Can I wear an oversize
man's T-shirt and bobby socks?

35:52.152 --> 35:53.653
-Sure. Sure.
-Okay. Let's go.

35:53.695 --> 35:55.405
-Yes.
-[laughing]

35:55.447 --> 36:05.915
***

36:05.957 --> 36:08.668
The energy when I walked in
was weird,

36:08.710 --> 36:11.046
and I was surprised
by Jen's reaction.

36:11.087 --> 36:12.505
She got really emotional

36:12.547 --> 36:14.132
when you said
what the trip was for.

36:14.174 --> 36:16.676
Well, I mean it. I really hope
that we can all, like,

36:16.718 --> 36:18.345
come together for her now.
-Yeah.

36:18.386 --> 36:20.930
What is Lisa's expectations?

36:20.972 --> 36:22.515
Was she nervous
about seeing Meredith?

36:22.557 --> 36:24.517
She's not nervous, no.

36:24.559 --> 36:26.728
She should be nervous.
Why is she not nervous?

36:26.770 --> 36:28.730
WHITNEY: Well,
she's being really vulnerable,

36:28.772 --> 36:30.982
and that's, I think,
a good space to start.

36:31.024 --> 36:32.233
HEATHER: No, for sure.

36:32.275 --> 36:35.362
I just feel, like, icky,
'cause...

36:35.403 --> 36:37.614
I don't want
to be put in the middle

36:37.655 --> 36:40.158
of Meredith and Lisa's fight.

36:40.200 --> 36:43.620
You have Meredith,
who's coming to me with rumors.

36:43.661 --> 36:45.789
Meredith has talked to you
about rumors about Lisa?

36:45.830 --> 36:46.998
Mm-hmm.

36:47.040 --> 36:48.375
I'm trying not to smile.

36:48.416 --> 36:49.876
[laughter]

36:49.918 --> 36:51.753
Why does that make you
wanna smile? You didn't know?

36:51.795 --> 36:55.507
Because I can't believe
that Meredith would ever...

36:55.548 --> 36:57.050
Has she not shared
anything with you?

36:57.092 --> 36:58.385
HEATHER: Nothing.

36:58.426 --> 37:00.553
Oh, she fully came over
to my house

37:00.595 --> 37:03.640
and brought up rumors
about Lisa having--

37:03.682 --> 37:06.810
-About what?
-Um, like, affairs.

37:08.520 --> 37:10.980
She only alluded
to affairs and then--

37:11.022 --> 37:12.941
-Multiple?
-Yeah, but what Meredith

37:12.982 --> 37:16.111
has heard,
out of Meredith's own mouth,

37:16.152 --> 37:19.030
that Lisa has performed
sexual favors

37:19.072 --> 37:20.573
for the advancement...
-[snickers]

37:21.783 --> 37:23.702
-Vida Tequila?
-Yeah.

37:23.743 --> 37:25.662
So that people
would take it, but...

37:25.704 --> 37:27.831
-Stop, stop, stop, stop.
-I know. I know.

37:27.872 --> 37:29.708
And then she'd be like,
"Isn't that absurd?"

37:29.749 --> 37:33.378
Who--who was she servicing?
Vendors?

37:33.420 --> 37:36.214
Bartenders? Bar owners?

37:36.256 --> 37:37.632
I know it sounds absurd,
Heather.

37:37.674 --> 37:39.884
-State liquor store officials?
-However...

37:39.926 --> 37:43.430
Listen, my point now is
now that I've heard Lisa out,

37:43.471 --> 37:46.141
and I feel like
I've gotten to know her,

37:46.182 --> 37:49.185
I feel bad, 'cause I fully,
like, participated.

37:49.227 --> 37:52.022
Because I've heard
the same rumors about her, too.

37:52.063 --> 37:54.733
Part of me just wanted to, like,
give her a heads up

37:54.774 --> 37:57.527
or, like, ask her about it.
I don't know.

37:57.569 --> 38:00.071
I don't know what to do.
Like, what do you do?

38:00.113 --> 38:03.074
Need I remind you that
we are on a girls trip for Jen?

38:03.116 --> 38:05.535
And this is not the time
to give Lisa

38:05.577 --> 38:07.454
a heads up
about horrible rumors

38:07.495 --> 38:09.247
that Whitney may have heard.

38:09.289 --> 38:12.250
Hell, no. Don't say a word.

38:12.292 --> 38:15.920
I think our goal should be
just to celebrate Jen,

38:15.962 --> 38:18.089
and we'll
deal with that after this.

38:18.131 --> 38:20.592

38:20.633 --> 38:22.177
<i>Coming up...</i>

38:22.218 --> 38:25.638
***

38:39.194 --> 38:48.203
***

38:52.874 --> 38:54.292
-Hi.
-WHITNEY: Kisses and hugs.

38:54.334 --> 38:56.086
Nice to meet you in person.

38:56.127 --> 38:58.880
You look beautiful.
And with the slippers? [laughs]

38:58.922 --> 39:01.758
I'm really excited
to meet with the shaman

39:01.800 --> 39:04.719
because I feel like
now more than ever,

39:04.761 --> 39:07.972
I need to release this pain
and this heaviness.

39:08.014 --> 39:10.725
And who better to do it with

39:10.767 --> 39:13.645
than this group of girls
who are equally as ----ed up?

39:13.687 --> 39:14.938
Let's heal.

39:14.979 --> 39:16.564
So you wanna go ahead and start?

39:16.606 --> 39:18.149
-We have one more.
-One more.

39:18.191 --> 39:20.527
<i>-Una más.</i>
-WHITNEY: I want to get going.

39:20.568 --> 39:22.237
-Okay, let's go.
-No, let's start.

39:22.278 --> 39:23.863
I'm saying,
she'll join when she can.

39:23.905 --> 39:25.990
Meredith is late once again

39:26.032 --> 39:27.742
to one
of my healing ceremonies.

39:27.784 --> 39:29.786
But this time,
I'm starting without her.

39:29.828 --> 39:31.705
And there's a saying
amongst healers

39:31.746 --> 39:33.248
and the universe--

39:33.289 --> 39:36.292
"Those who need the most healing
avoid healing."

39:36.334 --> 39:37.419
***

39:37.460 --> 39:38.920
[cellphone rings]

39:38.962 --> 39:41.715
-[cellphone chimes]
-Hi, honey. How are you?

39:41.756 --> 39:44.843
<i>-Hey. Good. How are you?</i>
-I'm good.

39:44.884 --> 39:48.013
<i>Have you seen Lisa yet?</i>

39:48.054 --> 39:52.559
Well, I'm in a house with four
other people, so, um, yeah.

39:52.600 --> 39:55.103
<i>Have you gone over</i>
<i>where all the exit doors are?</i>

39:57.772 --> 39:59.816
<i>What's on the docket?</i>

39:59.858 --> 40:02.193
We have a shaman coming.
I'm not sure if that's, like,

40:02.235 --> 40:04.904
the right thing for me
right now.

40:04.946 --> 40:06.823
I've worked
with a shaman before,

40:06.865 --> 40:09.534
and it was
an incredible experience,

40:09.576 --> 40:11.453
but really intense.

40:11.494 --> 40:14.289
And my current dynamic
with Lisa

40:14.330 --> 40:17.417
definitely plays
a big part in my hesitation

40:17.459 --> 40:19.294
to run outside.

40:19.336 --> 40:21.296
You know,
you're opening your energy,

40:21.338 --> 40:23.840
and she's shown me
that she's someone

40:23.882 --> 40:26.593
I should be
protecting my energy from.

40:26.634 --> 40:30.221
All right, ladies,
I am so excited

40:30.263 --> 40:32.140
to be guiding you
in the ceremony tonight.

40:32.182 --> 40:37.854
I'm going to come around
and pass out the cacao elixir.

40:37.896 --> 40:41.066
Cacao is a deep
heart opening medicine.

40:44.611 --> 40:47.530
I thought
it would taste different.

40:47.572 --> 40:49.282
-[laughter]
-[coughs]

40:49.324 --> 40:50.867
WHITNEY: It's not hot cocoa.
[laughs]

40:50.909 --> 40:53.536
I would like to release
the flavor in my mouth.

40:53.578 --> 40:54.621
[laughter]

40:54.662 --> 40:56.206
Is it weird that I like it?

40:56.247 --> 40:57.499
Yes.

40:57.540 --> 40:59.751
I love chocolate,
so why wouldn't I love cacao?

40:59.793 --> 41:01.127
It's earthy.

41:01.169 --> 41:02.462
I'm boring. I've never
done a drug in my life.

41:02.504 --> 41:05.006
I've never even smoked weed.
I barely take Advil.

41:05.048 --> 41:07.759
Like, I had
my augmentation with nothing.

41:07.801 --> 41:10.720
I, like, went
and got a Diet Coke after.

41:10.762 --> 41:14.349
What we're going to do
is set an intention to release.

41:14.391 --> 41:17.435
It can be something very small.
It can be something very big.

41:17.477 --> 41:20.021
Once we let go of that pain,
we create all this space

41:20.063 --> 41:22.607
to call in
whatever we truly want,

41:22.649 --> 41:24.818
literally our life's desires.

41:24.859 --> 41:26.820
We'll start with Whitney.

41:26.861 --> 41:29.030
Go ahead and share what it is
you're releasing.

41:29.072 --> 41:35.912
I'm letting go
of past trauma, past hurt.

41:35.954 --> 41:37.372
KSENIYA:
And what are you calling in?

41:37.414 --> 41:40.041
I'm calling in Oneness.

41:40.083 --> 41:43.044
We'll seal that intention
for Whitney.

41:45.046 --> 41:50.301
I am releasing shame
of not making my family proud,

41:50.343 --> 41:55.807
and I want to call in
love and understanding.

41:55.849 --> 42:02.564
***

42:02.605 --> 42:06.526
I'm releasing the fear
of going to trial in 30 days.

42:06.568 --> 42:09.779
[voice breaking]
I'm calling in...

42:09.821 --> 42:12.157
[sniffles] my innocence

42:12.198 --> 42:15.994
and to just show my family
that I love them

42:16.036 --> 42:18.621
every single second
of every day.

42:18.663 --> 42:24.919

42:24.961 --> 42:26.379
KSENIYA: Lisa?

42:26.421 --> 42:29.257
I-I suck at this.

42:29.299 --> 42:33.887
I'm releasing hurt...
[voice breaking] and sadness.

42:33.928 --> 42:38.808
And I'm calling in love,
support...and kindness.

42:38.850 --> 42:42.896
***

42:42.937 --> 42:44.814
Go ahead and close your eyes

42:44.856 --> 42:46.983
and hold that cacao
to your heart.

42:47.025 --> 42:49.402
As the cacao starts
working through our system,

42:49.444 --> 42:51.738
we're gonna go ahead
and start with the breath.

42:51.780 --> 42:55.867
So I will tell you a little bit
about the breath work.

42:55.909 --> 42:58.119
There can be...Hello.

42:58.161 --> 42:59.746
-Hello.
-Welcome.

42:59.788 --> 43:00.747
-Hi.
-Hi.

43:00.789 --> 43:03.917

43:03.958 --> 43:05.418
Go ahead and have a seat.

43:05.460 --> 43:08.129
***

43:08.171 --> 43:12.175
When you arrive late, you don't
get to pick where you sit,

43:12.217 --> 43:16.012
and now Meredith
has to sit next to Lisa.

43:16.054 --> 43:18.515
For the lady that
joined us a little bit late,

43:18.556 --> 43:20.767
did you have something
that you want to release

43:20.809 --> 43:22.268
that you want
to share with the group?

43:22.310 --> 43:23.687
Um...

43:23.728 --> 43:26.856
It could be a specific person,
situation, relationship,

43:26.898 --> 43:29.859
anything.

43:29.901 --> 43:33.238
I'm--I'm not ready
to share right now.

43:33.279 --> 43:36.700
KSENIYA:
Okay. Okay. No problem.

43:36.741 --> 43:39.828
***

43:39.869 --> 43:43.123
All right, ladies, go ahead

43:43.164 --> 43:44.499
and use the cushion
that you're sitting on.

43:44.541 --> 43:47.502
Flip it
and go ahead and lie down.

43:47.544 --> 43:50.839
We're all gonna
start the breath together.

43:50.880 --> 43:53.341
[inhaling and exhaling deeply]

43:53.383 --> 43:55.719
Good, remembering
what it is you're releasing,

43:55.760 --> 43:56.886
what it is
you're letting go of.

43:56.928 --> 43:58.138
[exhales deeply]

43:58.179 --> 44:02.058
You are not
what happened to you.

44:02.100 --> 44:04.728
That doesn't define you.

44:04.769 --> 44:06.354
Let the tears come.

44:06.396 --> 44:08.189
You don't
have to hold it back.

44:08.231 --> 44:10.608
I'm right here with you.
I know it's scary.

44:10.650 --> 44:12.569
My eyes are closed,
and I'm just seeing

44:12.610 --> 44:15.780
the people
that I love most in my life.

44:15.822 --> 44:17.323
Coach is so strong.

44:17.365 --> 44:18.950
He's, like,
my biggest cheerleader,

44:18.992 --> 44:22.370
but it's hard for him.

44:22.412 --> 44:25.999
Just like I'm sure--
I know it's hard for my boys.

44:28.752 --> 44:30.670
-[exhales deeply]
-Good.

44:30.712 --> 44:33.923
Omar wondering if I'm gonna be
at his football games

44:33.965 --> 44:36.176
or Rieffy wondering
if I'm going to be

44:36.217 --> 44:39.512
at his white coat ceremony
in medical school.

44:39.554 --> 44:44.642
It's just stuff
we don't talk about, but...

44:44.684 --> 44:47.354
that's just the reality of my--
of the situation right now.

44:49.189 --> 44:50.648
KSENIYA:
You're so worthy of love,

44:50.690 --> 44:54.903
unwinding yourself
from all those stories.

44:54.944 --> 44:58.573
They're not yours to carry.

44:58.615 --> 45:01.284
It's okay.
Let it come up for release.

45:01.326 --> 45:02.827
-[exhales deeply]
-Good.

45:02.869 --> 45:04.537
What I was expecting to release

45:04.579 --> 45:07.707
was the hurt and sadness
I felt with my friends.

45:07.749 --> 45:11.544
KSENIYA: Lots coming up
for you over here.

45:11.586 --> 45:15.256
What I ended up releasing
was something totally different.

45:15.298 --> 45:17.175
It wasn't what I was expecting.

45:21.596 --> 45:24.140
Abandonment.

45:24.182 --> 45:26.893
KSENIYA:
Big releases coming for you.

45:26.935 --> 45:29.729
Big shifts coming for you.

45:29.771 --> 45:33.108
You're ready to let it go.
I know you are. I feel it.

45:33.149 --> 45:36.194
The only memory
that kept coming to my mind

45:36.236 --> 45:38.321
was me as a little girl.

45:41.241 --> 45:43.702
We were in this play area,
and there was a slide,

45:43.743 --> 45:46.162
and I kept going up and down
the slide, and my dad said,

45:46.204 --> 45:48.456
"Last time. We're done.
We're leaving."

45:48.498 --> 45:50.583
And I waited
till they walked ahead of me,

45:50.625 --> 45:53.503
and then I turned around and
went right back to the slide.

45:53.545 --> 45:57.590
After about 20 times going down
the slide with these other kids,

45:57.632 --> 46:00.176
I went up to the desk
and told the lady,

46:00.218 --> 46:02.429
like, "Hey, I don't know
where my mom and dad are."

46:02.470 --> 46:05.015
That's the only thought that
kept going through my head

46:05.056 --> 46:09.102
is I'm, like, "Oh, my God, you
didn't even notice I was gone."

46:09.144 --> 46:10.937
Beautiful, ladies.

46:10.979 --> 46:13.064
Really good releases.

46:13.106 --> 46:15.233
Really good releases.
Stay with it.

46:15.275 --> 46:17.110
Give yourself this gift.

46:17.152 --> 46:20.238
As I'm going through
all of this,

46:20.280 --> 46:23.158
the truth is, I'm being brought
to where I was last year.

46:24.659 --> 46:27.287
Dealing with my father,
dealing with my nephew...

46:27.328 --> 46:29.581
I have a nephew
with mental health issues.

46:29.622 --> 46:33.543
...and the treatment
I received over it

46:33.585 --> 46:35.170
and the pain.

46:38.381 --> 46:40.967
We're building up for a big
release here, ladies, okay?

46:41.009 --> 46:42.469
So build up that breath.

46:42.510 --> 46:45.055
Okay, everything
we've been holding in,

46:45.096 --> 46:47.515
we're about to let it go
with a big yell.

46:47.557 --> 46:52.187
I did not pack
a Costco-size box of Kleenex

46:52.228 --> 46:55.273
'cause I did not anticipate
this many tears.

46:55.315 --> 46:57.484
This is night one.

46:57.525 --> 46:58.485
KSENIYA:
On the count of three,

46:58.526 --> 47:01.654
one, two, three.
Out with a yell.

47:01.696 --> 47:07.660
[all yelling]

47:07.702 --> 47:08.953
[laughter]

47:08.995 --> 47:12.332
Good.
Powerful work, everyone.

47:12.374 --> 47:14.459
So I'm gonna go ahead
and give a round of applause

47:14.501 --> 47:16.419
to all of you
for being so brave.

47:16.461 --> 47:18.463
The whole point of
this experience with the shaman

47:18.505 --> 47:21.508
is to be vulnerable
and to be open

47:21.549 --> 47:23.885
and to work
through something hard.

47:23.927 --> 47:25.512
What I got from that experience

47:25.553 --> 47:27.931
is that I'm gonna need
my friends to lean on

47:27.972 --> 47:30.934
and help me get through this.
I can't do this alone.

47:30.975 --> 47:32.977
KSENIYA:
How are we feeling?

47:33.019 --> 47:36.523
My body was, like,
numb and tingly.

47:36.564 --> 47:41.403
And I fed off of, like--
I could feel everyone's energy,

47:41.444 --> 47:44.406
and it helped push me a little
bit farther to release more.

47:44.447 --> 47:46.866
And how about you, love?
What was that like for you?

47:46.908 --> 47:48.702
It was intense,

47:48.743 --> 47:51.538
and it's not my first time
working with a shaman.

47:51.579 --> 47:53.707
And so I apologize
to all of you

47:53.748 --> 47:57.293
for not getting here
in a timely fashion.

47:57.335 --> 48:00.588
But I had some anxiety about it,
to be quite honest.

48:00.630 --> 48:03.675
It stems
from me not feeling very safe.

48:03.717 --> 48:07.429
Do you feel that way,
like, right now?

48:07.470 --> 48:08.888
Like,
after this whole experience,

48:08.930 --> 48:10.223
do you feel any safer?

48:10.265 --> 48:13.893
I'm very much triggered
by our last trip

48:13.935 --> 48:18.231
and--and having my father's
death weaponized against me.

48:18.273 --> 48:22.277
And now I'm here
with the same group

48:22.318 --> 48:24.946
a few days after the anniversary
of losing him,

48:24.988 --> 48:26.906
and it's a lot for me.

48:26.948 --> 48:29.743
Well, I used to feel like
I was a safe space for you,

48:29.784 --> 48:32.245
And I'm sorry.
-You are not a safe space, Lisa.

48:32.287 --> 48:34.164
I know. I said--I said I...

48:34.205 --> 48:37.751
Never mind.
I won't say another...word.

48:37.792 --> 48:41.880
***

48:41.921 --> 48:43.882
Bye.

48:43.923 --> 48:49.804
***

48:49.846 --> 48:52.265
I'm not gonna lie.

49:01.900 --> 49:02.817
***

49:07.447 --> 49:08.990
What did Lisa say to you first?

49:09.032 --> 49:11.701
She said she used to think
she was a safe space for me,

49:11.743 --> 49:13.161
and I said,
"You are not a safe space."

49:13.203 --> 49:15.830
I'm not gonna lie.

49:15.872 --> 49:17.248
[scoffs]

49:17.290 --> 49:20.835
***

49:20.877 --> 49:22.671
I'm gonna go grab Lisa.
I'm just gonna see

49:22.712 --> 49:24.381
if I can convince her
to come back.

49:24.422 --> 49:26.633
My legs are asleep.

49:26.675 --> 49:28.843
[laughter]

49:28.885 --> 49:31.596
Meredith, I'm here
to work through things with you

49:31.638 --> 49:33.890
and give you support
for whatever you need to,

49:33.932 --> 49:38.228
'cause I know
how painful and hurtful it is.

49:39.187 --> 49:41.481
Hey, are you okay?

49:44.859 --> 49:47.445
-No, it's okay, listen.
-Yeah.

49:51.574 --> 49:53.493
No, no, I just had to--
I needed a break.

49:53.535 --> 49:57.205
I know. I know.
But now you're coming back.

49:57.247 --> 49:58.873
Right now I know you ladies

49:58.915 --> 50:02.210
are probably starving,
so maybe at dinnertime,

50:02.252 --> 50:04.295
this could be a lovely segue

50:04.337 --> 50:06.256
to keep
these conversations flowing.

50:06.297 --> 50:08.675
-You know what I mean?
-Yeah, I know.

50:08.717 --> 50:09.843
-I'm fine sitting in it.
-I know. I know.

50:09.884 --> 50:11.594
-I needed to get up.
-I'm glad you did

50:11.636 --> 50:14.639
in that moment,
'cause it started to turn.

50:14.681 --> 50:17.392
HEATHER: Come on. They're
already at dinner. Let's go.

50:17.434 --> 50:22.063
***

50:22.105 --> 50:24.357
Ooh, wow. Thank you.

50:24.399 --> 50:27.485
This is, like, a Caprese salad,
and then we have

50:27.527 --> 50:28.445
the charcuterie board
over there.

50:28.486 --> 50:30.113
Ooh, I am starving.

50:30.155 --> 50:32.532
I don't know about you,
but emotional breathing

50:32.574 --> 50:34.909
takes a lot out of me.
[chuckles]

50:34.951 --> 50:36.453
Thanks for putting
that together, Whitney.

50:36.494 --> 50:37.871
-That was awesome.
-Thank you.

50:37.912 --> 50:39.873
Yeah, thank you
for participating.

50:39.914 --> 50:42.000
-You're welcome.
-Feels good to come together.

50:43.793 --> 50:48.757
What did everybody set
as their thing to release?

50:50.216 --> 50:52.427
HEATHER: You want to start?

50:52.469 --> 50:57.349
Um, I wanted
to be able to release

50:57.390 --> 50:59.726
the fear
of going to trial in a month.

50:59.768 --> 51:00.852
Mm-hmm.

51:00.894 --> 51:02.354
The other day,
I had, like, a little bit

51:02.395 --> 51:04.314
of a breakdown
because, you know,

51:04.356 --> 51:06.983
I get new information, right?

51:07.025 --> 51:08.735
From the attorneys saying,

51:08.777 --> 51:10.111
"Oh, there's a new discovery."

51:10.153 --> 51:11.571
And I got in the car.

51:11.613 --> 51:12.989
It was, like,
3 in the morning,

51:13.031 --> 51:15.492
and I drove
down to my dad's grave.

51:15.533 --> 51:17.327
MEREDITH: Aw.

51:17.369 --> 51:20.205
[sobs] It just... [sniffles]

51:20.246 --> 51:22.874
So, Coach is, like,
"Um, hello, where are you?"

51:22.916 --> 51:27.045
-And then I blocked him.
-[laughter]

51:27.087 --> 51:28.630
He did nothing wrong,

51:28.672 --> 51:31.508
but, you know,
I was just having a moment.

51:33.051 --> 51:37.138
Every time the phone rings,
I don't know what I'm gonna hear

51:37.180 --> 51:38.348
on the other end of the phone.

51:38.390 --> 51:40.558
What is the new accusation?

51:40.600 --> 51:43.728
What is the new motion
that needs to be filed?

51:43.770 --> 51:47.816
I am on edge
100% of the time.

51:47.857 --> 51:50.652
I think we all kind of saw
at Coach Shah's party

51:50.694 --> 51:51.861
how much love...
-LISA: It was amazing.

51:51.903 --> 51:53.405
...and support.

51:53.446 --> 51:55.740
That felt really good to me
as your friend

51:55.782 --> 51:59.160
to see, you know, the family
show up, celebrate Sharrieff,

51:59.202 --> 52:01.454
celebrate you.

52:12.298 --> 52:13.675
I've been
on this healing journey

52:13.717 --> 52:18.054
for, honestly,
probably a year now.

52:18.096 --> 52:20.515
[sighs] A lot of--I have...

52:20.557 --> 52:23.727
My childhood
is blocked from, like, 9 to 17.

52:23.768 --> 52:27.063
And as I'm doing all this work,

52:27.105 --> 52:29.816
like, memories are coming up,
and...

52:32.068 --> 52:35.822
I was
in a very abusive situation.

52:35.864 --> 52:40.035
But I, like, stuffed it so deep
that I blocked all memory of it.

52:40.076 --> 52:46.374
***

52:46.416 --> 52:47.959
Physically abusive?

52:49.961 --> 52:51.796
You?

52:51.838 --> 52:53.882
Yeah.

52:53.923 --> 53:05.393

53:09.397 --> 53:11.900
All aboard

53:11.941 --> 53:16.071
[cheering]

53:16.112 --> 53:17.739
[Spanish guitar riff]

53:17.781 --> 53:19.449
Are we supposed to clap

53:19.491 --> 53:21.326
or just, like, respect
and be quiet?

53:21.368 --> 53:22.577
-I think just respect.
-Okay.

53:22.619 --> 53:23.828
[whinnies]

53:23.870 --> 53:26.039
Are you just
gonna move on with Lisa?

53:26.081 --> 53:28.833
I'm not willing
to open myself up

53:28.875 --> 53:31.127
to somebody who's just
gonna stab me in the heart.

53:31.169 --> 53:33.963
Stop being a condescending,
superior bitch.

53:36.049 --> 53:40.345
I have talked with Meredith
about rumors about you.

53:40.387 --> 53:44.224
Does this feel ----ing good?
Like, ----ing hurt me more.

53:44.265 --> 53:45.809
I didn't know. I didn't know.

53:45.850 --> 53:47.936
I have told you everything,
Heather.

53:47.977 --> 53:50.397
We were at the Jazz game
with Angie, and she goes,

53:50.438 --> 53:54.401
"That's who Lisa sleeps with
for the Jazz tickets."

53:54.442 --> 53:55.902
-Wait, what?
-Well, guess what?

53:55.944 --> 53:58.238
I didn't hear
that ----ing nugget!

53:58.279 --> 53:59.572
You are lying right now.

53:59.614 --> 54:02.992
[bleep] you for calling me
a ----ing liar!

54:03.034 --> 54:06.663
[bleep] you!
