00:37.667 --> 00:38.367
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

00:38.433 --> 00:41.467
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.

00:41.533 --> 00:42.066
JUST TIME FOR A QUICK RECAP OF

00:42.133 --> 00:42.734
THE WEEK.

00:42.800 --> 00:43.400
AND IT WAS PARTICULARLY GRIM,

00:43.467 --> 00:44.033
WITH YESTERDAY'S ANTI-SEMITIC

00:44.100 --> 00:44.800
ATTACK LEAVING ELEVEN DEAD AT A

00:44.867 --> 00:45.934
PITTSBURGH SYNAGOGUE.

00:46.000 --> 00:46.500
THIS WAS JUST DAYS AFTER AN

00:46.567 --> 00:47.100
APPARENTLY RACIALLY-MOTIVATED

00:47.166 --> 00:48.033
SHOOTING IN LOUISVILLE,

00:48.100 --> 00:48.734
AND A SERIES OF PACKAGE BOMBS

00:48.800 --> 00:49.567
BEING SENT TO PROMINENT

00:49.633 --> 00:51.734
CRITICS OF DONALD TRUMP.

00:51.800 --> 00:54.000
IT HAS BEEN A TIME FOR SOBER

00:54.066 --> 01:04.800
REFLECTION -- OR, IF YOU'RE

01:04.867 --> 01:05.633
FOX NEWS DISCUSSING THOSE

01:05.700 --> 01:06.567
PACKAGE BOMBS, A TIME FOR WILD

01:06.633 --> 01:07.433
SPECULATION.

01:07.500 --> 01:08.266
BECAUSE BEFORE THE SUSPECT WAS

01:08.333 --> 01:09.133
ARRESTED, THEY WERE GIVING

01:09.200 --> 01:10.166
AIRTIME TO A TRULY LUDICROUS

01:10.233 --> 01:10.867
THEORY.

01:10.934 --> 01:11.700
>> YOU TALKED IN YOUR

01:11.767 --> 01:12.667
NOTES EARLIER ABOUT THE

01:12.734 --> 01:13.734
POTENTIAL THAT IT COULD BE A

01:13.800 --> 01:14.500
FALSE FLAG.

01:14.567 --> 01:15.734
>> WE CANNOT RULE OUT THAT

01:15.800 --> 01:17.667
IT IS A FALSE FLAG OPERATION.

01:17.734 --> 01:18.233
>> THE FACT THAT THESE BOMBS

01:18.300 --> 01:18.967
HAVE NOT GONE OFF IS A GREAT

01:19.033 --> 01:19.800
INDICATION THAT I FEEL THESE ARE

01:19.867 --> 01:20.767
FALSE FLAG BOMBINGS.

01:20.834 --> 01:21.834
>> AT THE RISK OF SOUNDING LIKE

01:21.900 --> 01:23.367
A FAR RIGHTWING LUNATIC, I HAVE

01:23.433 --> 01:25.000
TO SAY THAT I BELIEVE THIS WHOLE

01:25.066 --> 01:26.900
THING WAS AN ELABORATE HOAX.

01:26.967 --> 01:28.333
>> John: YEAH, BUT HERE'S THE

01:28.400 --> 01:29.867
THING: "SOUNDING LIKE A

01:29.934 --> 01:31.433
FAR RIGHT-WING LUNATIC" IS NOT

01:31.500 --> 01:33.834
REALLY A RISK FOR THE FOX NEWS

01:33.900 --> 01:36.066
BRAND, IT'S MORE OF A GUARANTEE.

01:36.133 --> 01:37.433
IT'D BE LIKE IF TONY BENNETT

01:37.500 --> 01:38.567
STARTED EVERY SONG WITH "AT THE

01:38.633 --> 01:39.800
RISK OF MAKING YOUR GRANDMA

01:39.867 --> 01:40.967
WET," WHAT'RE YOU TALKING ABOUT,

01:41.033 --> 01:42.800
TONY?

01:42.867 --> 01:44.033
WE ALL KNOW IT'S GOING TO

01:44.100 --> 01:44.633
HAPPEN, AND IT'S WHAT YOU'RE

01:44.700 --> 01:47.233
HERE TO DO.

01:47.300 --> 01:48.800
NOW, ONCE THE SUSPECT WAS FOUND,

01:48.867 --> 01:50.400
AND IT WAS CLEAR NOT JUST THAT

01:50.467 --> 01:52.400
THE BOMBS WERE REAL BUT

01:52.467 --> 01:54.100
THAT HE WAS VERY MUCH A TRUMP

01:54.166 --> 01:55.600
SUPPORTER, GERALDO APOLOGIZED,

01:55.667 --> 01:57.367
TWEETING, "NEVER MIND;

01:57.433 --> 01:58.567
OUTSMARTED MYSELF IN CONJURING

01:58.633 --> 02:00.300
FALSE FLAG OPERATION."

02:00.367 --> 02:02.166
AND CAN I JUST SAY "OUTSMARTED

02:02.233 --> 02:03.433
MYSELF" IS A BRILLIANT WAY TO

02:03.500 --> 02:04.467
SAY YOU DID SOMETHING

02:04.533 --> 02:06.533
INCREDIBLY STUPID.

02:06.600 --> 02:08.367
"WOW, I REALLY OUTSMARTED

02:08.433 --> 02:09.100
MYSELF THIS MORNING WHEN I

02:09.166 --> 02:10.133
ACCIDENTALLY ATE KITTY LITTER

02:10.200 --> 02:11.767
INSTEAD OF GRAPE NUTS.

02:11.834 --> 02:12.700
I REMEMBER THINKING, AS I CHEWED

02:12.767 --> 02:14.633
THE CLUMPS, "I TRULY AM TWO

02:14.700 --> 02:18.033
STEPS AHEAD OF ME!"

02:18.100 --> 02:19.900
BUT INCREDIBLY, EVEN AFTER THE

02:19.967 --> 02:21.233
SUSPECT'S MOTIVATIONS WERE

02:21.300 --> 02:22.633
CLEAR, SOME TRUMP SUPPORTERS

02:22.700 --> 02:24.400
REMAINED INSISTENT THAT THERE

02:24.467 --> 02:27.533
WAS MORE TO THIS STORY.

02:27.600 --> 02:30.033
>> BARACK OBAMA PROBABLY SENT

02:30.100 --> 02:30.600
HIS TO HIMSELF, AND HILLARY

02:30.667 --> 02:31.200
CLINTON PROBABLY SENT HERS TO

02:31.266 --> 02:32.300
HERSELF.

02:32.367 --> 02:33.500
>> YOU DON'T THINK THIS GUY

02:33.567 --> 02:34.033
SENT THESE BOMBS?

02:34.100 --> 02:35.066
>> NO.

02:35.133 --> 02:35.800
PROBABLY NOT.

02:35.867 --> 02:37.000
>> WHY?

02:37.066 --> 02:38.867
>> THEY PROBABLY HAD IT DONE.

02:38.934 --> 02:39.533
THEY MAY HAVE PAID HIM TO DO

02:39.600 --> 02:40.500
IT.

02:40.567 --> 02:41.934
>> WHAT WOULD BE THE UPSIDE OF

02:42.000 --> 02:42.934
THAT?

02:43.000 --> 02:45.734
>> TRYING TO BRING PEOPLE OVER

02:45.800 --> 02:47.333
TO THEIR SIDE.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.767
>> And AGAINST TRUMP?

02:49.834 --> 02:52.033
>> John: GOT IT, SO OBAMA FLEW

02:52.066 --> 02:53.867
TO FLORIDA, MAILED A BOMB TO

02:53.934 --> 02:55.233
HIMSELF IN WASHINGTON, THEN FLEW

02:55.300 --> 02:57.133
BACK JUST IN TIME TO AVOID IT,

02:57.200 --> 02:59.734
ALL TO FRAME THIS GUY.

02:59.800 --> 03:01.166
I'M NOT SAYING THAT MAN'S THEORY

03:01.233 --> 03:02.800
DOESN'T HAVE ANY HOLES IN IT,

03:02.867 --> 03:04.333
BUT AT LEAST WE CAN AGREE: HE

03:04.400 --> 03:04.900
REALLY OUTSMARTED GERALDO

03:04.967 --> 03:07.400
RIVERA.

03:07.467 --> 03:09.367
MOVING ON TO SAUDI ARABIA.

03:09.433 --> 03:10.500
THE COUNTRY WITH BANS ON PORK,

03:10.567 --> 03:12.633
ALCOHOL, AND PORN, OR AS IT'S

03:12.700 --> 03:13.533
KNOWN IN AMERICA, A "FLORIDA

03:13.600 --> 03:16.266
BREAKFAST."

03:16.333 --> 03:17.700
SAUDI ARABIA IS CONTINUING TO

03:17.767 --> 03:18.867
DEAL WITH THE ONGOING FALLOUT

03:18.934 --> 03:20.367
FROM THE DEATH OF JOURNALIST

03:20.433 --> 03:21.834
JAMAL KHASHOGGI, WHO DISAPPEARED

03:21.900 --> 03:23.333
AFTER ENTERING THE SAUDI ARABIAN

03:23.400 --> 03:24.934
CONSULATE IN ISTANBUL, WHICH

03:25.000 --> 03:26.500
REPORTEDLY ALSO CONTAINED 15

03:26.567 --> 03:28.600
SAUDI OPERATIVES WHO'D FLOWN IN

03:28.667 --> 03:30.233
WITH AN AUTOPSY SPECIALIST AND A

03:30.300 --> 03:31.233
BONE SAW.

03:31.300 --> 03:32.600
THE SAUDIS INITIALLY INSISTED

03:32.667 --> 03:33.967
KHASHOGGI HAD LEFT THE EMBASSY

03:34.033 --> 03:35.800
ALIVE, BUT NOW ADMIT THEY'D

03:35.867 --> 03:38.233
INCORRECTLY REMEMBERED WHAT

03:38.300 --> 03:39.333
HAPPENED -- "DISMEMBERED," IF

03:39.400 --> 03:41.266
YOU WILL.

03:41.333 --> 03:42.800
THEIR STORY INSTEAD BECAME THAT

03:42.867 --> 03:44.367
HE'D BEEN KILLED, BUT FOR GOOD

03:44.433 --> 03:46.333
REASON.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.033
>> THEY SAY DISCUSSIONS LED TO A

03:48.100 --> 03:49.300
BRAWL, AND HE DIED IN A

03:49.367 --> 03:55.600
FISTFIGHT.

03:55.667 --> 03:56.767
>> John: YEAH, A FISTFIGHT.

03:56.834 --> 03:58.133
APPARENTLY IT STARTED WHEN THEY

03:58.200 --> 03:58.767
HAD A DISAGREEMENT OVER WHETHER

03:58.834 --> 03:59.333
OR NOT KHASHOGGI SHOULD BE

03:59.400 --> 04:00.500
MURDERED IN COLD BLOOD.

04:00.567 --> 04:01.233
YOU SEE, HE DIDN'T THINK SO, BUT

04:01.300 --> 04:02.100
THE SAUDIS WERE REALLY ADAMANT

04:02.166 --> 04:02.867
ABOUT IT, AND, WELL, ONE THING

04:02.934 --> 04:04.333
LED TO ANOTHER.

04:04.400 --> 04:05.800
OF COURSE, THIS STORY WAS -- AS

04:05.867 --> 04:06.800
KHASHOGGI'S EDITOR AT THE

04:06.867 --> 04:08.367
WASHINGTON POST TWEETED

04:08.433 --> 04:10.467
"UTTER BULLSHIT," WHICH SHOULD

04:10.533 --> 04:11.867
ALSO DEFINITELY BE THE NEW

04:11.934 --> 04:12.767
TERM THE POST USES WHEN FACT

04:12.834 --> 04:14.500
CHECKING POLITICIANS.

04:14.567 --> 04:15.900
IT'S CERTAINLY BETTER THAN USING

04:15.967 --> 04:19.367
A SYSTEM OF ONE TO FOUR YOU'RE A

04:19.433 --> 04:20.767
JOURNALISTIC INSTITUTION, WHY

04:20.834 --> 04:22.066
ARE YOU USING A DISHONEST WOOD

04:22.133 --> 04:24.600
DEMON FROM A CHILDREN'S STORY?

04:24.667 --> 04:26.066
THE SAUDIS THEN ABANDONED THAT

04:26.133 --> 04:28.333
STORY, AND SUGGESTED THE KILLING

04:28.400 --> 04:30.333
MAY HAVE BEEN "PREMEDITATED",

04:30.400 --> 04:30.867
WHICH WAS OBVIOUS FROM THE

04:30.934 --> 04:32.133
START.

04:32.200 --> 04:33.433
ESPECIALLY AS IT NOW APPEARS THE

04:33.500 --> 04:35.033
KILLERS HAD THE LAZIEST OF

04:35.100 --> 04:36.500
STRATEGIES TO CONVINCE PEOPLE

04:36.567 --> 04:37.567
KHASHOGGI HAD LEFT THE CONSULATE

04:37.633 --> 04:39.266
SAFELY.

04:39.333 --> 04:40.900
>> CNN AIRED WHAT APPEARS TO BE

04:40.967 --> 04:42.100
SURVEILLANCE VIDEO DESCRIBED TO

04:42.166 --> 04:44.200
THEM BY A TURKISH SOURCE AS ONE

04:44.266 --> 04:46.400
OF THE KEY SUSPECTS DRESSED IN

04:46.467 --> 04:48.300
KHASHOGGI'S CLOTHES, EVEN

04:48.367 --> 04:51.667
APPARENTLY A FAKE BEARD.

04:51.734 --> 04:53.600
>> John: THAT'S PATHETIC.

04:53.667 --> 04:55.166
KHASHOGGI IS BALD, AND THE BODY

04:55.233 --> 04:58.367
DOUBLE HAS A FULL HEAD OF HAIR.

04:58.433 --> 04:59.800
IF YOU'RE PICKING A BODY DOUBLE

04:59.867 --> 05:00.767
FOR SOMEONE, YOU BETTER MAKE

05:00.834 --> 05:02.000
SURE THEY LOOK EXACTLY LIKE

05:02.066 --> 05:03.600
THAT PERSON.

05:03.667 --> 05:04.767
WHICH IS WHY MY BODY DOUBLE IS

05:04.834 --> 05:06.500
THIS OWL.

05:06.567 --> 05:08.300
THE RESEMBLANCE IS UNCANNY!

05:08.367 --> 05:09.633
YOU CAN'T EVEN TELL WHICH ONE IS

05:09.700 --> 05:13.100
THE REAL OWL!

05:13.166 --> 05:15.066
THIS WHOLE HORRIFIC SITUATION

05:15.133 --> 05:16.400
HAS PUT TRUMP IN A DIFFICULT

05:16.467 --> 05:17.834
POSITION.

05:17.900 --> 05:18.900
BECAUSE HE'S CLOSE TO THE SAUDI

05:18.967 --> 05:20.734
LEADERSHIP, AND HAS BEEN BENDING

05:20.800 --> 05:22.033
OVER BACKWARDS TO TRY AND EXCUSE

05:22.100 --> 05:24.166
WHAT HAPPENED.

05:24.233 --> 05:25.333
AND EVEN AS THE SAUDIS' STORY

05:25.400 --> 05:26.600
UNRAVELED, HE UNLEASHED A

05:26.667 --> 05:28.867
CRITIQUE THAT CAN ONLY BE

05:28.934 --> 05:30.834
DESCRIBED AS VERY, VERY WEIRD.

05:30.900 --> 05:33.066
>> THEY HAD A VERY BAD ORIGINAL

05:33.133 --> 05:35.900
CONCEPT.

05:35.967 --> 05:38.333
IT WAS CARRIED OUT POORLY.

05:38.400 --> 05:39.467
AND THE COVER-UP WAS ONE OF THE

05:39.533 --> 05:41.200
WORST IN THE HISTORY OF

05:41.266 --> 05:41.934
COVER-UPS.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.300
IT'S VERY SIMPLE.

05:44.367 --> 05:45.834
>> John: "A VERY BAD ORIGINAL

05:45.900 --> 05:47.600
CONCEPT?"

05:47.667 --> 05:49.100
YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT ADDRESSING

05:49.166 --> 05:50.667
THE ASSASSINATION OF A PERMANENT

05:50.734 --> 05:52.233
RESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,

05:52.300 --> 05:53.867
NOT A NETFLIX EXECUTIVE DECIDING

05:53.934 --> 05:54.734
WHETHER TO GREENLIGHT A NEW

05:54.800 --> 05:56.567
SERIES.

05:56.633 --> 05:58.033
AND BESIDES, EVEN IF YOU WERE,

05:58.100 --> 05:59.367
EVERYONE KNOWS THE NETFLIX

05:59.433 --> 06:00.400
DEVELOPMENT MOTTO IS "THERE ARE

06:00.467 --> 06:03.000
NO BAD ORIGINAL CONCEPTS."

06:03.066 --> 06:05.633
THIS STORY IS HORRENDOUS.

06:05.700 --> 06:06.600
AND BUSINESSES WITH TIES TO

06:06.667 --> 06:08.033
SAUDI ARABIA HAVE NOW COME IN

06:08.100 --> 06:09.400
FOR GREATER SCRUTINY,

06:09.467 --> 06:11.600
INCLUDING THE WWE, WHO YOU MAY

06:11.667 --> 06:14.033
REMEMBER SIGNED A 10-YEAR DEAL

06:14.100 --> 06:15.500
TO STAGE EVENTS THERE, AND WHO

06:15.567 --> 06:17.066
IN APRIL STAGED THE "GREATEST

06:17.133 --> 06:18.600
ROYAL RUMBLE" IN JEDDAH, WHICH

06:18.667 --> 06:20.567
WAS WALL-TO-WALL PROPAGANDA FOR

06:20.633 --> 06:21.867
THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT.

06:21.934 --> 06:23.000
THERE WAS ACTUALLY A CLIP FROM

06:23.066 --> 06:24.100
THAT EVENT THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE

06:24.166 --> 06:24.800
TIME TO SHOW YOU LAST

06:24.867 --> 06:25.967
TIME, INVOLVING WRESTLER

06:26.066 --> 06:28.200
TITUS O'NEILL, WHO RAN IN TO THE

06:28.266 --> 06:30.367
ARENA, TO JUMP INTO THE RING.

06:30.433 --> 06:31.767
I PROMISE YOU: WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT

06:31.867 --> 06:33.500
TO SEE WAS NOT STAGED.

06:33.567 --> 06:34.500
>> TITUS HAD A VERY BUSY

06:34.567 --> 06:36.033
WEEK HERE IN SAUDI ARABIA.

06:36.100 --> 06:37.767
HE'S HAD DINNER WITH MANY

06:37.834 --> 06:38.900
PRINCES AND VERY IMPORTANT

06:38.967 --> 06:44.000
PEOPLE, AND HE'S JUST --

06:44.066 --> 06:46.033
OH MY GOD, WHAT THE HECK?

06:46.100 --> 06:47.066
>> John: I DON'T THINK THERE'S

06:47.133 --> 06:47.700
ANY BETTER ENCAPSULATION OF THE

06:47.767 --> 06:49.800
WWE'S RELATIONSHIP

06:49.867 --> 06:51.600
WITH SAUDI ARABIA THAN A

06:51.667 --> 06:52.800
WRESTLER MEETING SAUDI ARABIAN

06:52.867 --> 06:53.734
PRINCES BEFORE FALLING FLAT ON

06:53.800 --> 07:00.700
HIS FACE.

07:00.767 --> 07:01.433
WWE ACTUALLY HAS THEIR NEXT

07:01.500 --> 07:02.300
EVENT IN SAUDI ARABIA, "CROWN

07:02.367 --> 07:05.300
JEWEL," SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE

07:05.367 --> 07:06.200
THIS FRIDAY.

07:06.266 --> 07:07.266
THEY'VE UNDERSTANDABLY BEEN

07:07.333 --> 07:08.133
UNDER PRESSURE TO CANCEL IT, AND

07:08.200 --> 07:08.867
THERE ARE UNCONFIRMED

07:08.934 --> 07:09.533
REPORTS THAT JOHN CENA WANTS TO

07:09.600 --> 07:10.433
PULL OUT OF THE EVENT.

07:10.533 --> 07:11.367
AND THE TRUTH IS, WRESTLING FANS

07:11.433 --> 07:13.100
HAVE LONG BEEN UNCOMFORTABLE

07:13.166 --> 07:13.967
WITH THE SAUDI DEAL.

07:14.033 --> 07:16.166
IN FACT, JUST LISTEN TO A CROWD

07:16.233 --> 07:17.734
THAT'S CHEERING FOR THE

07:17.800 --> 07:19.867
UNDERTAKER SUDDENLY TAKE A TURN

07:19.934 --> 07:21.233
WHEN HE BRINGS UP CROWN JEWEL.

07:28.433 --> 07:30.900
>> FIFTEEN-THOUSAND STRONG

07:30.967 --> 07:32.433
CHANTING ON THEIR FEET FOR

07:32.500 --> 07:37.567
THE PHENOM.

07:37.633 --> 07:42.000
>> AT CROWN JEWEL --

07:56.934 --> 07:58.266
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

07:58.333 --> 07:59.066
I THINK THE WWE ITSELF HAS JUST

07:59.133 --> 07:59.967
TURNED HEEL.

08:00.033 --> 08:00.767
I MEAN, DO YOU KNOW HOW CLEARLY,

08:00.834 --> 08:01.700
DEEPLY BAD SOMETHING HAS TO BE

08:01.767 --> 08:02.300
TO GET WRESTLING FANS TO BOO A

08:02.367 --> 08:03.433
WRESTLING EVENT AT A WRESTLING

08:03.500 --> 08:04.066
EVENT?

08:04.133 --> 08:04.667
THAT'S THE TYPE OF CROWD

08:04.734 --> 08:05.834
REACTION YOU'D EXPECT TO HEAR IF

08:05.900 --> 08:06.467
THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP WAS WON BY

08:06.533 --> 08:06.934
BECK.

08:07.000 --> 08:07.800
WHICH IS TOTALLY PLAUSIBLE, BY

08:07.867 --> 08:08.800
THE WAY.

08:08.867 --> 08:09.467
THE GUY'S A SCIENTOLOGIST -- AND

08:09.533 --> 08:10.467
THEY GIVE YOU SUPERPOWERS.

08:10.533 --> 08:12.266
IT'S NOT JUST A RELIGION, IT'S A

08:12.333 --> 08:13.033
SET OF PRINCIPLES TO HELP YOU

08:13.100 --> 08:14.834
UNDERSTAND AND IMPROVE YOUR

08:14.900 --> 08:22.834
LIFE AND MAYBE FLY.

08:22.900 --> 08:24.033
JUST LOOK INTO IT.

08:24.100 --> 08:26.166
THAT'S ALL I'M COMPELLING YOU

08:26.233 --> 08:27.767
SINCERELY.

08:27.834 --> 08:28.700
AND YET, DESPITE ALL THE

08:28.767 --> 08:29.700
CRITICISM, THE WWE IS GOING FULL

08:29.767 --> 08:30.367
STEAM AHEAD WITH CROWN JEWEL, IN

08:30.433 --> 08:31.000
PARTNERSHIP WITH A COUNTRY THAT

08:31.066 --> 08:34.834
-- REMEMBER -- JUST MURDERED AND

08:34.900 --> 08:35.967
DISMEMBERED A JOURNALIST FOR THE

08:36.033 --> 08:36.567
WASHINGTON POST.

08:36.633 --> 08:37.300
AND THEIR PROMOTION FOR IT HAS

08:37.367 --> 08:40.066
BEEN A LITTLE TONE-DEAF, SUCH AS

08:40.133 --> 08:47.667
--

08:47.734 --> 08:48.367
POST FEATURING A FUNERAL URN,

08:48.433 --> 08:49.100
WHICH WAS INITIALLY CAPTIONED,

08:49.166 --> 08:50.000
"RESPECT IS OUT THE WINDOW AT

08:50.066 --> 08:50.633
#WWECROWNJEWEL."

08:50.700 --> 08:51.467
WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY INSENSITIVE,

08:51.533 --> 08:52.600
BUT ALSO, KIND OF NONSENSE?

08:52.667 --> 08:53.600
THE URN IS REFERRING TO

08:53.667 --> 08:54.200
THE UNDERTAKER, BUT THAT'S NOT

08:54.266 --> 08:55.200
HIS CATCHPHRASE.

08:55.266 --> 08:56.667
HIS CATCHPHRASE, AS WE ALL KNOW,

08:56.734 --> 08:58.133
IS "BOO! I'M A BIG BEEF GHOST

08:58.200 --> 09:04.433
HERE TO DRIVE YOU TO HELL."

09:04.500 --> 09:07.567
I AM A BEEF GHOST.

09:07.633 --> 09:09.667
THAT'S WHAT HE SAYS WHEN HE

09:09.734 --> 09:11.600
WRESTLES.

09:11.667 --> 09:12.667
LOOK.

09:12.734 --> 09:13.433
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY FOR

09:13.500 --> 09:14.400
THE WWE TO THREAD THE NEEDLE ON

09:14.467 --> 09:14.667
THIS.

09:14.734 --> 09:15.800
THEY'RE PUSHING AHEAD WITH THE

09:15.867 --> 09:16.467
EVENT DESPITE THE SERIOUS

09:16.533 --> 09:17.133
CONCERNS OF SOME OF THEIR OWN

09:17.200 --> 09:17.834
WRESTLERS, AND THEIR OWN FAN

09:17.900 --> 09:18.800
BASE.

09:18.867 --> 09:30.066
BUT SINCE THEY'VE CLEARLY PICKED

09:30.133 --> 09:30.667
A LANE HERE, THEY MAY AS WELL

09:30.734 --> 09:31.367
JUST SAY FUCK IT AND GO FULL

09:31.433 --> 09:31.967
THROTTLE WITH THE

09:32.033 --> 09:32.533
MARKETING, AND AIR SOMETHING

09:32.600 --> 09:39.400
LIKE THIS.

09:39.467 --> 09:45.233
>> NO FEMALE WRESTLERS BECAUSE

09:45.300 --> 09:47.166
THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED.

09:47.233 --> 09:49.133
WATCH THE BROTHERS OF

09:49.200 --> 09:52.600
DESTRUCTION GET BURIED.

09:52.667 --> 09:55.900
SORRY, POOR CHOICE OF WORDS.

09:55.967 --> 09:57.967
SOMEONE IS GOING TO REST IN

09:58.033 --> 09:58.367
PIECES.

09:58.433 --> 09:59.767
NO, HANG ON.

09:59.834 --> 10:01.033
SOMEONE IS GOING TO BE AMBUSHED

10:01.100 --> 10:04.300
AND MUTILATED WITH A BONE SAW.

10:04.367 --> 10:05.633
THE POINT IS NEXT FRIDAY AT

10:05.700 --> 10:10.367
CROWN JEWEL, RESPECT IS OUT THE

10:10.433 --> 10:10.600
WINDOW.

10:10.667 --> 10:11.967
AND IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT

10:12.033 --> 10:12.967
HUMAN RIGHTS, THE WWE HAS GOT

10:13.033 --> 10:17.266
TWO WORDS FOR YOU.

10:17.333 --> 10:31.066
SUCK IT!

10:31.133 --> 10:31.667
>> John: MOVING ON.

10:31.734 --> 10:32.533
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

10:32.600 --> 10:33.066
STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL.

10:33.133 --> 10:33.700
AND YES, THAT IS THE CORRECT

10:33.767 --> 10:34.600
PLURAL, AND IF YOU ALREADY KNEW

10:34.667 --> 10:35.433
THAT I'M SORRY THAT HIGH SCHOOL

10:35.500 --> 10:36.033
WAS SUCH A ROUGH TIME FOR YOU.

10:36.100 --> 10:37.166
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW.

10:37.233 --> 10:38.734
BEING A TEENAGE GRAMMAR NERD IS

10:38.800 --> 10:39.900
SOMETHING FROM WHICH IT'S

10:39.967 --> 10:43.033
DIFFICULT TO RECOVER.

10:43.100 --> 10:44.667
AND I REALIZE THAT A SHOW ABOUT

10:44.734 --> 10:46.033
STATE A-G'S SOUNDS LIKE A

10:46.100 --> 10:47.066
TEDIOUS PROSPECT.

10:47.133 --> 10:48.934
JUST WATCH THE START OF THE 2006

10:49.000 --> 10:51.233
PANEL DISCUSSION ON C-SPAN, IN

10:51.300 --> 10:53.433
FRONT OF AN ELECTRIFIED CROWD.

10:53.500 --> 10:56.100
>> OUR PANEL TODAY FEATURES

10:56.166 --> 10:58.834
THREE DISTINGUISHED AND VERY

10:58.900 --> 11:01.433
DIFFERENT AND BIPARTISAN

11:01.500 --> 11:07.033
ATTORNEYS GENERAL.

11:07.100 --> 11:07.900
>> John: WOW.

11:07.967 --> 11:08.467
I GOTTA SAY -- BIT OF A DICK

11:08.533 --> 11:10.333
MOVE BY THE C-SPAN CAMERA MAN.

11:10.400 --> 11:11.166
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO PAN ACROSS THE

11:11.233 --> 11:12.533
EMPTY SEATS, BUT HE DID IT

11:12.600 --> 11:14.767
ANYWAY, AS IF TO SAY, "LOOK,

11:14.834 --> 11:15.734
EVEN THE PANEL'S FRIENDS DIDN'T

11:15.800 --> 11:17.333
SHOW UP!"

11:17.400 --> 11:18.133
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THAT

11:18.200 --> 11:19.500
PANEL DID WRONG.

11:19.567 --> 11:20.867
IF YOU WANT A LIVE AUDIENCE TO

11:20.934 --> 11:22.133
LISTEN TO YOU TALK ABOUT STATE

11:22.200 --> 11:23.834
A-G'S, SIMPLY DON'T TELL THEM

11:23.900 --> 11:25.200
IN ADVANCE.

11:25.266 --> 11:26.800
WE FILM THIS SHOW IN FRONT OF A

11:26.867 --> 11:28.200
LIVE AUDIENCE.

11:28.266 --> 11:29.333
YOU THINK WE TOLD THEM WHAT THIS

11:29.400 --> 11:30.200
SHOW'S ABOUT?

11:30.266 --> 11:31.734
OF COURSE NOT!

11:31.800 --> 11:32.934
THEY WERE EXPLICITLY TOLD THIS

11:33.000 --> 11:34.133
WAS A TAPING OF "THE RACHAEL RAY

11:34.200 --> 11:35.333
SHOW."

11:35.400 --> 11:36.400
AND I PROMISE YOU, SHE'LL BE OUT

11:36.467 --> 11:39.400
ANY MINUTE NOW.

11:39.467 --> 11:40.367
BUT IT'S WORTH THE EFFORT TO

11:40.433 --> 11:42.500
LEARN ABOUT STATE A-G'S.

11:42.567 --> 11:44.400
BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT,

11:44.467 --> 11:46.233
AND YET, MOST OF US PROBABLY

11:46.300 --> 11:47.834
DON'T KNOW WHO OURS IS.

11:47.900 --> 11:49.567
ALTHOUGH, IF YOU LIVE IN

11:49.633 --> 11:50.333
INDIANA, I AM VERY EXCITED TO

11:50.400 --> 11:52.633
INTRODUCE YOU TO YOURS.

11:52.700 --> 11:54.667
MEET CURTIS HILL: A-G BY DAY,

11:54.734 --> 11:55.967
ALTHOUGH BY NIGHT,

11:56.033 --> 11:58.066
HE'S VERY MUCH SOMETHING ELSE.

11:58.133 --> 12:00.066
>> I WAS TOYING AROUND WITH IT,

12:00.133 --> 12:02.066
AND DISCOVERED I SOUNDED SORT OF

12:02.133 --> 12:03.667
LIKE ELVIS.

12:03.734 --> 12:05.400
>> ♪ WE'RE CAUGHT IN A TRAP ♪

12:05.467 --> 12:08.166
♪ I CAN'T WALK OUT ♪

12:08.233 --> 12:09.767
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU TOO MUCH BABY

12:09.834 --> 12:11.934
♪ ♪

12:12.000 --> 12:12.867
>> WE SAW THE ATTORNEY

12:12.934 --> 12:14.700
GENERAL DO ALL THE HITS.

12:14.767 --> 12:17.433
>> ♪ ♪ SAY, ONLY FOOLS, ONLY

12:17.500 --> 12:21.000
FOOLS RUSH IN ♪

12:21.066 --> 12:21.967
>> I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE

12:22.033 --> 12:22.567
NOTICED, BUT I DON'T LOOK MUCH

12:22.633 --> 12:24.700
LIKE ELVIS.

12:24.767 --> 12:26.200
>> John: TO BE HONEST, I HADN'T.

12:26.266 --> 12:28.867
FRANKLY, IT'S DIFFICULT TO

12:28.934 --> 12:30.467
NOTICE ANYTHING BESIDES THE MOST

12:30.533 --> 12:31.467
SADISTIC INSEAM IN THE HISTORY

12:31.533 --> 12:33.400
OF TAILORING.

12:33.467 --> 12:35.233
THAT LOOKS LIKE A MARSHMELLOW

12:35.300 --> 12:46.233
BISECTED WITH FISHING WIRE.

12:46.300 --> 12:47.300
MOST STATE A-G'S ARE ACTUALLY

12:47.367 --> 12:48.266
ELECTED -- MEANING THEY BELONG

12:48.333 --> 12:49.300
TO POLITICAL PARTIES,

12:49.367 --> 12:50.166
AND RUN CAMPAIGN ADS, LIKE THIS

12:50.233 --> 12:50.800
STRIKING ONE FROM MICHIGAN.

12:50.867 --> 12:51.633
>> WHEN YOU'RE CHOOSING

12:51.700 --> 12:52.633
MICHIGAN'S NEXT ATTORNEY

12:52.700 --> 12:53.734
GENERAL, ASK YOURSELF THIS: WHO

12:53.800 --> 12:54.834
CAN YOU TRUST MOST NOT TO SHOW

12:54.900 --> 12:55.667
YOU THEIR PENIS IN A

12:55.734 --> 12:58.467
PROFESSIONAL SETTING?

12:58.533 --> 13:00.967
IS IT THE CANDIDATE WHO DOESN'T

13:01.033 --> 13:01.500
HAVE A PENIS?

13:01.567 --> 13:03.734
I'D SAY SO.

13:03.800 --> 13:05.667
>> John: WELL THAT'S

13:05.734 --> 13:08.166
CERTAINLY... AN ARGUMENT.

13:08.233 --> 13:10.066
THOUGH IF YOU'RE ASKING ME WHICH

13:10.133 --> 13:11.934
CANDIDATE I TRUST MOST NOT TO

13:12.000 --> 13:12.734
SHOW ME THEIR PENIS, I'D HAVE TO

13:12.800 --> 13:14.934
GO WITH DICKLESS DENNIS.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.233
HE CAN'T SHOW ME HIS PENIS --

13:17.300 --> 13:18.033
THAT MEAN OLD RACCOON STILL HAS

13:18.100 --> 13:21.233
IT!

13:21.300 --> 13:22.567
THAT WOMAN IS RUNNING FOR

13:22.633 --> 13:25.133
ATTORNEY GENERAL IN MICHIGAN.

13:25.200 --> 13:26.400
IT'S ONE OF 30 STATES WHERE

13:26.467 --> 13:27.633
VOTERS WILL BE SELECTING THEIR

13:27.700 --> 13:29.400
NEXT A-G ON NOVEMBER 6.

13:29.467 --> 13:30.266
AND THOSE ELECTIONS ARE GOING TO

13:30.333 --> 13:32.467
BE UNUSUALLY COMPETITIVE.

13:32.533 --> 13:34.567
SOME ESTIMATE THAT MORE THAN 100

13:34.633 --> 13:35.700
MILLION DOLLARS WILL BE SPENT

13:35.767 --> 13:37.300
ON A-G RACES THIS YEAR -- UP TO

13:37.333 --> 13:38.700
THREE TIMES MORE THAN EVER

13:38.767 --> 13:41.233
BEFORE.

13:41.300 --> 13:42.867
TONIGHT, LET'S LOOK AT WHO A-G'S

13:42.967 --> 13:44.200
ARE, WHAT THEY DO, AND WHY THEY

13:44.266 --> 13:45.233
MATTER.

13:45.300 --> 13:46.367
AND LET'S START WITH WHAT THEY

13:46.433 --> 13:47.300
DO.

13:47.367 --> 13:48.700
TYPICALLY, THEY SERVE AS A

13:48.767 --> 13:50.166
STATE'S CHIEF LEGAL OFFICER AND

13:50.233 --> 13:51.767
THE PEOPLE'S LAWYER -- WITH

13:51.834 --> 13:52.700
RESPONSIBILITIES RANGING FROM

13:52.767 --> 13:53.533
CRIMINAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO

13:53.600 --> 13:54.934
CONSUMER ADVOCACY, AND

13:55.000 --> 13:56.600
EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN.

13:56.667 --> 13:59.200
THE LANDMARK, MULTI-BILLION

13:59.266 --> 13:59.567
TOBACCO INDUSTRY

13:59.633 --> 14:00.133
SETTLEMENT IN THE '90S

14:00.200 --> 14:01.934
THAT KILLED JOE CAMEL?

14:02.000 --> 14:04.400
THAT WAS THANKS TO STATE A-G'S.

14:04.467 --> 14:05.133
THIS YEAR'S HEADLINES ABOUT THIS

14:05.200 --> 14:05.800
BLOCKBUSTER REPORT ON ABUSES BY

14:05.867 --> 14:06.300
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN

14:06.367 --> 14:08.066
PENNSYLVANIA?

14:08.133 --> 14:09.767
THAT WAS THANKS TO A STATE A-G.

14:09.834 --> 14:11.033
YOU KNOW WHO PUT OUT THAT RAGING

14:11.100 --> 14:12.800
WILDFIRE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA?

14:12.867 --> 14:13.133
FIRE-FIGHTERS.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.400
USE YOUR HEAD.

14:14.467 --> 14:15.533
WHY WOULD STATE A-G'S HAVE BEEN

14:15.600 --> 14:20.000
INVOLVED?

14:20.066 --> 14:20.467
C'MON.

14:20.533 --> 14:22.000
THE FACT IS, A-G'S OFTEN WORK ON

14:22.066 --> 14:23.100
POLITICALLY NEUTRAL MATTERS.

14:23.166 --> 14:26.000
AND THEY STILL DO.

14:26.066 --> 14:27.233
BUT IN RECENT DECADES, THEY'VE

14:27.300 --> 14:28.200
ALSO BECOME SIGNIFICANTLY MORE

14:28.266 --> 14:29.967
PARTISAN.

14:30.033 --> 14:31.066
ONE SMALL SIGN OF THIS IS THAT

14:31.133 --> 14:32.967
WHILE ALL A-G'S BELONG TO THE

14:33.033 --> 14:34.734
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF

14:34.800 --> 14:36.000
ATTORNEYS GENERAL, OR "NAAG",

14:36.066 --> 14:37.800
AROUND TWO DECADES AGO,

14:37.867 --> 14:39.433
REPUBLICANS FORMED A SEPARATE

14:39.500 --> 14:40.600
COMMITTEE JUST FOR THEM,

14:40.667 --> 14:41.800
RAGA, AND THE DEMOCRATS FOLLOWED

14:41.867 --> 14:44.266
SUIT, WITH DAGA.

14:44.333 --> 14:46.667
AND I KNOW RAGA AND DAGA SOUND

14:46.734 --> 14:48.500
LIKE TWINS FROM DUTCH FOLKLORE

14:48.567 --> 14:49.133
THAT TEACH CHILDREN ABOUT RIGHT

14:49.200 --> 14:51.033
AND WRONG.

14:51.100 --> 14:53.100
RAGA ALWAYS MILKS THE COW WHEN

14:53.166 --> 14:54.567
ITS UDDERS ARE SWOLLEN, BUT DAGA

14:54.633 --> 14:55.467
IS OFF MAKING NONSENSE WITH A

14:55.533 --> 14:57.367
GOOSE.

14:57.433 --> 14:59.900
WHEN DAGA IS GIVEN NO DINNER,

14:59.967 --> 15:03.400
THIS IS JUSTICE.

15:03.467 --> 15:04.767
BUT ARGUABLY THE MOST

15:04.834 --> 15:06.200
HIGH-PROFILE WAY IN WHICH THIS

15:06.266 --> 15:07.533
JOB HAS BECOME MORE PARTISAN IS

15:07.600 --> 15:09.166
THE EXTENT TO WHICH A-G'S

15:09.233 --> 15:11.734
BELONGING TO ONE PARTY HAVE

15:11.800 --> 15:12.367
TEAMED UP TO BRING LAWSUITS

15:12.433 --> 15:14.266
AGAINST THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

15:14.333 --> 15:16.166
THAT USED TO BE RELATIVELY RARE,

15:16.233 --> 15:17.467
BUT STARTING IN THE OBAMA YEARS,

15:17.533 --> 15:18.266
THE NUMBER OF THOSE SORT OF

15:18.333 --> 15:19.767
LAWSUITS SKYROCKETED.

15:19.834 --> 15:22.300
IT WAS REPUBLICAN A-G'S WHO

15:22.367 --> 15:24.000
SUCCESSFULLY LIMITED THE

15:24.066 --> 15:25.967
MEDICAID EXPANSION OF OBAMACARE.

15:26.033 --> 15:27.633
AND SUING THE GOVERNMENT BECAME

15:27.700 --> 15:28.600
A POINT OF PRIDE FOR A-G'S LIKE

15:28.667 --> 15:30.533
TEXAS'S GREG ABBOTT.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.867
>> WHAT I DO IS I GO INTO THE

15:32.934 --> 15:34.500
OFFICE, I SUE THE FEDERAL

15:34.567 --> 15:36.734
GOVERNMENT AND THEN I GO HOME.

15:36.800 --> 15:37.934
I'VE SUED THE OBAMA

15:38.000 --> 15:39.934
ADMINISTRATION NOW TWENTY-FIVE

15:40.000 --> 15:42.467
TIMES OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS.

15:42.533 --> 15:43.767
>> John: THAT'S NOT THE SMIRK OF

15:43.834 --> 15:45.467
A GUY WHO JUST GOES INTO THE

15:45.533 --> 15:47.700
OFFICE, SUES, AND GOES HOME.

15:47.767 --> 15:48.800
THAT'S THE SMIRK OF A GUY WHO

15:48.867 --> 15:50.934
GOES INTO THE OFFICE, SUES THE

15:51.000 --> 15:52.600
GOVERNMENT, ADJUSTS THE OFFICE

15:52.667 --> 15:53.500
THERMOSTAT WITHOUT TELLING

15:53.567 --> 15:54.700
ANYONE, STEALS SOMEONE'S

15:54.767 --> 15:55.867
SANDWICH FROM THE FRIDGE,

15:55.934 --> 15:56.934
FARTS IN THE ELEVATOR AND THEN

15:57.000 --> 15:59.100
GOES HOME.

15:59.166 --> 16:03.800
ABBOTT'S SINCE GONE ON TO BECOME

16:03.867 --> 16:10.400
GOVERNOR OF TEXAS, BUT HIS

16:10.467 --> 16:11.266
SUCCESSOR, KEN PAXTON WAS NO

16:11.333 --> 16:12.333
LESS EAGER TO SUE THE OBAMA

16:12.400 --> 16:12.700
ADMINISTRATION.

16:12.767 --> 16:13.333
JUST LISTEN TO HIS WIFE, PROUDLY

16:13.400 --> 16:14.500
DESCRIBING PAXTON'S LOVE FOR

16:14.567 --> 16:15.100
LAWSUITS IN WHAT APPARENTLY I

LISTEN TO MOOSE-KNUCKLE ELVIS,

16:40.133 --> 16:41.066
SHIRLEY TEMPLE-ING IT UP IN HIS

16:41.133 --> 16:41.834

ONESIE.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.100
PAXTON HIMSELF IS A GOOD EXAMPLE

16:46.166 --> 16:48.300
OF HOW A STATE A-G'S POLITICAL

16:48.367 --> 16:51.066
VIEWS CAN IMPACT THEIR WORK.

16:51.133 --> 16:53.200
HE TOLD COUNTY CLERKS THEY COULD

REFUSE TO ISSUE MARRIAGE

16:54.967 --> 16:56.900
LICENSES TO SAME SEX COUPLES.

16:56.967 --> 16:58.433
HE WAS A LEAD PLAINTIFF IN A

16:58.500 --> 17:00.000
LAWSUIT THAT SHOT DOWN AN

17:00.066 --> 17:01.233
OBAMA-ERA RULE THAT WOULD'VE

17:01.300 --> 17:02.734
MADE FOUR MILLION PEOPLE

17:02.800 --> 17:03.934
ELIGIBLE FOR OVERTIME PAY.

17:04.000 --> 17:04.934
AND WHEN THE OBAMA

17:05.000 --> 17:06.633
ADMINISTRATION TRIED TO EXTEND

17:06.700 --> 17:07.533
PROTECTIONS FOR TRANSGENDER KIDS

17:07.600 --> 17:08.500
IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS, PAXTON SUED

17:08.567 --> 17:10.433
AND SAID THIS.

17:10.500 --> 17:12.000
>> ANY MAN THAT DECIDES THAT

17:12.066 --> 17:14.166
THEY WANT DECLARE THEMSELVES TO

17:14.233 --> 17:16.033
BE FEMALE FOR THE DAY, CAN WALK

17:16.100 --> 17:16.633
INTO YOUR DAUGHTER'S LOCKER ROOM

17:16.700 --> 17:17.967
OR BATHROOM.

17:18.066 --> 17:19.867
IT NOW OPENS THE DOOR FOR

17:19.934 --> 17:21.300
ANYBODY, NO MATTER WHAT THEY

17:21.367 --> 17:22.600
ARE, AND HOW THEY'RE THINKING.

17:22.667 --> 17:24.467
THEY CAN CHANGE THEIR GENDER FOR

17:24.533 --> 17:26.233
A DAY AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO

17:26.300 --> 17:27.166
WALK INTO A WOMEN'S LOCKER ROOM.

17:27.233 --> 17:29.233
IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT.

17:29.300 --> 17:30.433
>> John: WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU

17:30.500 --> 17:31.867
TALKING ABOUT?

17:31.934 --> 17:34.000
OBVIOUS BIGOTRY ASIDE,

17:34.066 --> 17:35.333
TRANSGENDER PEOPLE DON'T JUST

17:35.400 --> 17:36.900
SWITCH IDENTITY FOR CONVENIENCE.

17:36.967 --> 17:38.600
THEY'RE HUMAN BEINGS, NOT REED

17:38.667 --> 17:43.166
FROGS.

17:43.233 --> 17:43.800
THAT'S RIGHT.

17:43.867 --> 17:44.500
REED FROGS, SHOULD THE NEED

17:44.600 --> 17:45.166
ARISE, CAN SPONTANEOUSLY CHANGE

17:45.233 --> 17:46.333
FROM FEMALE TO MALE.

17:46.400 --> 17:47.266
I JUST HIT YOU WITH AN

17:47.333 --> 17:48.700
UNEXPECTED FROG FACT IN THE

17:48.767 --> 17:50.200
MIDDLE OF TALKING ABOUT STATE

17:50.266 --> 17:50.800
ATTORNEYS GENERAL, AND I KNOW

17:50.867 --> 17:51.300
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING:

17:51.367 --> 17:53.233
"WHERE THE FUCK IS RACHAEL RAY?

17:53.300 --> 17:54.633
IF SHE'S NOT HERE IN THE NEXT

17:54.700 --> 17:55.934
FIVE MINUTES, I'M GOING TO

17:56.000 --> 17:58.667
RIOT."

17:58.734 --> 18:00.567
BE PATIENT -- SHE'LL BE HERE.

18:00.633 --> 18:03.700
SHE'S MAKING FRITATTAS, AND

18:03.767 --> 18:14.300
YOU'RE ALL GOING TO GET A TASTE!

18:14.367 --> 18:14.667
SHE'LL BE HERE.

18:14.734 --> 18:17.567
JUST BE PATIENT.

18:17.633 --> 18:18.667
NOW, PAXTON HAS ACTUALLY SPENT

18:18.734 --> 18:19.533
ALMOST HIS ENTIRE TIME IN OFFICE

18:19.600 --> 18:20.734
UNDER INDICTMENT AND AWAITING

18:20.800 --> 18:21.533
TRIAL FOR SECURITIES FRAUD.

18:21.600 --> 18:22.000
BUT THAT'S NOT THE KEN

18:22.066 --> 18:22.600
PAXTON-RELATED

18:22.667 --> 18:23.400
ALLEGATION I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU.

18:23.467 --> 18:24.133
INSTEAD, I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON

18:24.200 --> 18:24.734
ONE MENTIONED IN A REAL ATTACK

18:24.800 --> 18:26.834
AD FROM HIS CURRENT OPPONENT.

18:26.900 --> 18:28.500
>> THIS IS THE COLLIN COUNTY

18:28.567 --> 18:29.166
COURTHOUSE, WHERE A DALLAS

18:29.233 --> 18:29.800
ATTORNEY ACCIDENTALLY LEFT A ONE

18:29.867 --> 18:30.600
THOUSAND DOLLAR PEN AT THE METAL

18:30.667 --> 18:32.667
DETECTORS.

18:32.734 --> 18:36.200
>> THIS IS KEN PAXTON, THE

18:36.266 --> 18:38.200
RUMMAGING THROUGH THE METAL

18:38.266 --> 18:39.400
DETECTOR TRAYS AND STEALING THAT

18:39.467 --> 18:41.467
ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR PEN.

18:41.533 --> 18:43.700
AND THIS IS KEN PAXTON, THE

18:43.767 --> 18:45.500
INDICTED TEXAS ATTORNEY

18:45.567 --> 18:47.066
GENERAL, WALKING AWAY WITH A

18:47.133 --> 18:49.433
STOLEN PEN.

18:49.500 --> 18:50.767
VOTE JUSTIN NELSON FOR

18:50.834 --> 18:52.834
TEXAS ATTORNEY GENERAL.

18:52.900 --> 18:56.567
HE WILL FIGHT ON BEHALF OF ALL

18:56.633 --> 18:58.133
TEXANS AND HE WON'T STEAL YOUR

18:58.200 --> 19:01.367
PEN.

19:01.433 --> 19:02.300
>> John: WELL, THAT'S A RELIEF,

19:02.367 --> 19:03.100
THOUGH THANKS TO THAT AD

19:03.166 --> 19:04.266
EARLIER, I'D ALSO LIKE TO KNOW

19:04.333 --> 19:05.200
THAT HE WON'T STEAL MY PEN OR

19:05.266 --> 19:07.533
SHOW ME HIS PENIS.

19:07.600 --> 19:08.700
OR, FOR THAT MATTER, SHOW ME HIS

19:08.767 --> 19:10.734
PEN OR STEAL MY PENIS.

19:10.800 --> 19:11.867
I REALLY NEED TO KNOW ALL HIS

19:11.934 --> 19:12.633
POSITIONS ON THE

19:12.700 --> 19:14.700
PENIS-PEN SHOW-STEAL CONTINUUM.

19:14.767 --> 19:16.233
STILL, THE LARGER POINT IS STATE

19:16.300 --> 19:17.867
A-G'S ARE INCREASINGLY PARTISAN.

19:17.934 --> 19:19.500
AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW

19:19.567 --> 19:21.834
KEN PAXTON HAS USED HIS POWER,

19:21.900 --> 19:22.600
IT'S HARD NOT TO THINK THAT

19:22.667 --> 19:24.166
THAT'S A BAD THING.

19:24.233 --> 19:25.900
BUT PARTISANSHIP CAN CUT BOTH

19:25.967 --> 19:27.166
WAYS.

19:27.233 --> 19:29.834
AND NOW THAT TRUMP'S IN OFFICE,

19:29.900 --> 19:30.934
DEMOCRATIC STATE A-G'S ARE THE

19:31.000 --> 19:31.700
ONES FILING LAWSUITS AGAINST THE

19:31.767 --> 19:33.000
PRESIDENT.

19:33.066 --> 19:36.967
AND WHILE YOU MAY'VE BEEN

19:37.033 --> 19:37.834
UNHAPPY TO HEAR PEOPLE CHEER FOR

19:37.900 --> 19:38.300
ATTORNEYS GENERAL THAT

19:38.367 --> 19:39.367
PISTOL-PACKIN' MAMA'S HUSBAND

19:39.433 --> 19:40.800
SUING OBAMA, I SUSPECT IT FEELS

19:40.867 --> 19:42.166
A LITTLE DIFFERENT HEARING THE

19:42.233 --> 19:42.734
DEMOCRATIC A-G OF WASHINGTON

19:42.800 --> 19:44.633
STATE SAY THIS.

19:44.700 --> 19:45.700
>> WE HAVE, WE HAVE NINETEEN.

19:45.767 --> 19:46.233
SINCE DONALD TRUMP BECAME

19:46.300 --> 19:46.900
PRESIDENT WE'VE FILED

19:46.967 --> 19:47.500
NINETEEN LAWSUITS AGAINST THE

19:47.567 --> 19:49.000
ADMINISTRATION.

19:49.066 --> 19:49.967
>> SO WHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE

19:50.033 --> 19:50.633
WHO JUST THINK YOU HAVE AN AX TO

19:50.700 --> 19:53.033
GRIND AGAINST THIS GUY?

19:53.100 --> 19:56.100
>> WELL I, I PLEAD GUILTY.

19:56.166 --> 19:59.800
I MEAN, I DO.

19:59.867 --> 20:00.333
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

20:00.400 --> 20:00.700
YEAH.

20:00.767 --> 20:01.600
IT'S UH --

20:01.667 --> 20:02.734
>> John: IT'S INTERESTING HOW

20:02.800 --> 20:03.834
YOUR FEELINGS ON SUING THE

20:03.900 --> 20:04.533
GOVERNMENT CAN CHANGE A LOT

20:04.600 --> 20:06.867
BASED ON WHO'S SAYING IT.

20:06.934 --> 20:08.000
IT'S LIKE HOW "I'M GETTING OFF

20:08.066 --> 20:09.834
HERE" IS A FINE THING FOR

20:09.900 --> 20:10.667
SOMEONE TO SAY IF THEY'RE

20:10.734 --> 20:12.200
STANDING NEXT TO THE DOOR OF A

20:12.266 --> 20:13.233
TRAIN, BUT A VERY RUDE THING TO

20:13.300 --> 20:14.033
SAY IF THEY'RE MASTURBATING ON

20:14.100 --> 20:16.467
THAT SAME TRAIN.

20:16.533 --> 20:18.233
SO STATE A-G'S HAVE A LOT OF

20:18.300 --> 20:18.834
POWER.

20:18.900 --> 20:20.233
AND WHILE MANY OF US MAY NOT

20:20.300 --> 20:21.667
HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THAT,

20:21.734 --> 20:22.533
CORPORATIONS AND OTHER

20:22.600 --> 20:23.934
SPECIAL INTERESTS CERTAINLY

20:24.000 --> 20:24.967
HAVE.

20:25.033 --> 20:27.133
BECAUSE BOTH RAGA AND DAGA HAVE

20:27.200 --> 20:28.633
BEEN INCREASINGLY AGGRESSIVE

20:28.700 --> 20:30.367
ABOUT RAISING FUNDS.

20:30.433 --> 20:31.700
AND ONE WAY THEY DO THAT IS BY

20:31.767 --> 20:32.767
ORGANIZING EVENTS, WHERE THEY

20:32.834 --> 20:33.700
ESSENTIALLY SELL ACCESS TO

20:33.767 --> 20:35.433
A-G'S.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.166
RAGA, ESPECIALLY, HAS SOME

20:37.233 --> 20:38.667
PRETTY LAVISH GETAWAYS, WHERE

20:38.734 --> 20:41.500
INDUSTRIES CAN MINGLE WITH

20:41.567 --> 20:43.066
THE A-G'S WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE

20:43.133 --> 20:44.567
POLICING THEM, AS CBS FOUND WEN

20:44.633 --> 20:45.300
IT SPIED ON ONE IN SOUTH

20:45.367 --> 20:46.633
CAROLINA.

20:46.700 --> 20:48.233
>> WE SAW AT LEAST NINE STATE

20:48.300 --> 20:49.233
AGS RUBBING SHOULDERS WITH

20:49.300 --> 20:51.033
REPRESENTATIVES FROM KOCH

20:51.100 --> 20:53.667
INDUSTRIES, BIG TOBACCO,

20:53.734 --> 20:56.200
PAYDAY LENDERS, AND THE N.R.A.

20:56.266 --> 21:03.100
THE DRESS CODE: RESORT CASUAL.

21:03.166 --> 21:05.767
CBS NEWS REVIEWED 88 DONATIONS

21:05.834 --> 21:06.400
OVER $50,000 AND FOUND MORE THAN

21:06.467 --> 21:08.467
HALF OF THE DONORS HAD MATTERS

21:08.533 --> 21:10.934
UNDER CONSIDERATION OR HAD

21:11.000 --> 21:14.700
RECENTLY SETTLED.

21:14.767 --> 21:15.700
>> John: NOW RAGA SAYS THERE IS

21:15.767 --> 21:16.266
ABSOLUTELY NO QUID PRO QUO.

21:16.333 --> 21:16.967
SO I GUESS THOSE GROUPS SIMPLY

21:17.033 --> 21:18.200
DONATED SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF

21:18.266 --> 21:19.500
MONEY BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO

21:19.567 --> 21:21.100
CHILLAX TO THE MAX AT A "RESORT

21:21.166 --> 21:24.066
CASUAL" CLAMBAKE WITH IDAHO

21:24.133 --> 21:26.000
ATTORNEY GENERAL LAWRENCE

21:26.066 --> 21:27.100
WASDEN.

21:27.166 --> 21:29.667
HE'S NOT JUST THE A-G OF IDAHO,

21:29.734 --> 21:30.200
HE'S THE FUCKING MAYOR OF

21:30.266 --> 21:39.033
MARGARITAVILLE.

21:39.100 --> 21:43.033
HE IS FUCKING HARD.

21:43.100 --> 21:46.767
HE IS AN ANIMAL.

21:46.834 --> 21:47.800
AND SOME STATE A-G'S HAVE BEEN

21:47.867 --> 21:48.300
RIDICULOUSLY COZY WITH

21:48.367 --> 21:48.633
CORPORATIONS.

21:48.700 --> 21:49.233
TAKE SCOTT PRUITT, FORMER HEAD

21:49.300 --> 21:49.533
OF THE EPA.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.300
HE PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS

21:51.367 --> 21:53.333
OKLAHOMA'S A-G, WHERE HE HAD A

21:53.400 --> 21:53.900
VERY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH

21:53.967 --> 22:00.900
ENERGY COMPANIES.

22:00.967 --> 22:01.834
HE SUED THE EPA FOURTEEN TIMES,

22:01.900 --> 22:02.467
AND WROTE THE AGENCY MULTIPLE

22:02.533 --> 22:03.200
LETTERS ABOUT POLICIES

22:03.266 --> 22:03.900
THAT THREATENED TO IMPACT LOCAL

22:03.967 --> 22:04.533
OIL COMPANIES LIKE DEVON ENERGY.

22:04.600 --> 22:05.567
BUT WHEN A REPORTER OBTAINED

22:05.633 --> 22:05.967
COPIES OF PRUITT'S

22:06.033 --> 22:06.567
CORRESPONDENCE WITH DEVON, HE

22:06.633 --> 22:07.133
NOTICED A WEIRD COINCIDENCE.

22:07.200 --> 22:07.767
>> THE LETTERS THAT SCOTT PRUITT

22:07.834 --> 22:08.300
HAD WRITTEN WERE IDENTICAL

22:08.367 --> 22:10.233
COPIES, IN MOST CASES, OF THE

22:10.300 --> 22:10.800
DRAFT LETTERS THAT DEVON HAD

22:10.867 --> 22:13.100
SENT HIM.

22:13.166 --> 22:14.233
HE HAD TAKEN THOSE LETTERS AND

22:14.300 --> 22:16.533
SIMPLY PUT 'EM ON A STATIONERY

22:16.600 --> 22:17.900
AND SENT THEM IN AS IF THEY WERE

22:17.967 --> 22:18.700
ESSENTIALLY THE STATE LAW

22:18.767 --> 22:19.633
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL

22:19.700 --> 22:22.233
OPINION.

22:22.300 --> 22:25.033
I WAS, LIKE, "HOLY ."

22:25.100 --> 22:26.400
>> John: YEAH, LIKE HE SAID:

22:26.467 --> 22:29.667
HOLY MOTHERFUCKER.

22:29.734 --> 22:30.900
AND THAT SURE LOOKS LIKE PRUITT

22:30.967 --> 22:32.000
LET AN OIL COMPANY DO HIS WORK

22:32.066 --> 22:33.600
FOR HIM.

22:33.667 --> 22:35.133
ALTHOUGH, TO BE FAIR, MAYBE HE

22:35.200 --> 22:36.500
JUST HAPPENED TO THINK UP THE

22:36.567 --> 22:37.500
EXACT SAME WORDS, IN THE

22:37.567 --> 22:39.433
EXACT SAME ORDER THAT THEY DID.

22:39.500 --> 22:42.100
MAYBE YOU FIND THAT PLAUSIBLE.

22:42.166 --> 22:43.133
PERSONALLY, I FIND IT ABOUT AS

22:43.200 --> 22:44.233
PLAUSIBLE AS I DO THE IDEA THAT

22:44.300 --> 22:46.166
THE FAMILY IN "A QUIET PLACE"

22:46.233 --> 22:53.800
STAYED SILENT FOR 472 DAYS.

22:53.867 --> 22:54.433
WOW -- NO ONE FARTED FOR MORE

22:54.500 --> 22:55.433
THAN A YEAR!

22:55.500 --> 22:56.100
THAT SHOULD REALLY BE THE TITLE

22:56.166 --> 22:57.000
OF THE MOVIE -- THAT'S

22:57.066 --> 22:57.333
INCREDIBLE!

22:57.400 --> 22:58.367
SO STATE A-GS ARE POWERFUL,

22:58.433 --> 22:59.934
INCREASINGLY PARTISAN, AND OVER

23:00.000 --> 23:00.934
HALF OF THEM ARE ON THE BALLOT

23:01.000 --> 23:02.667
THIS YEAR.

23:02.734 --> 23:04.066
AND REPUBLICANS ARE VERY MUCH

23:04.133 --> 23:05.700
READY FOR THE FIGHT, AS ARKANSAS

23:05.767 --> 23:07.433
STATE A-G AND CHAIR OF RAGA,

23:07.500 --> 23:10.867
LESLIE RUTLEDGE, WILL TELL YOU.

23:10.934 --> 23:12.400
>> WHEN IT COMES TO THE

23:12.467 --> 23:14.400
DEMOCRATIC AG'S, I CAN'T SPEAK

23:14.467 --> 23:16.166
TO WHAT THEY DO.

23:16.233 --> 23:17.467
I KNOW THEY RAISE A HECK OF A

23:17.533 --> 23:18.667
LOT LESS MONEY THAN THE

23:18.734 --> 23:20.333
REPUBLICAN AG'S DO BECAUSE WE

23:20.400 --> 23:22.567
HAVE BEEN CRUSHING IT.

23:22.633 --> 23:24.467
>> John: OKAY, FIRST, AGAIN,

23:24.533 --> 23:25.433
DICK MOVE BY THE C-SPAN

23:25.500 --> 23:28.333
CAMERAMAN THERE.

23:28.400 --> 23:29.300
UNDERCUTTING HER CLAIMS OF

23:29.367 --> 23:30.900
CRUSHING IT WITH A CRUEL CUTAWAY

23:30.967 --> 23:32.166
TO HER AUDIENCE CANDYCRUSHING

23:32.233 --> 23:34.400
IT.

23:34.467 --> 23:37.467
BUT THE FACT IS, SHE'S RIGHT.

23:37.533 --> 23:39.467
RAGA IS OUT-RAISING DAGA, AND IT

23:39.533 --> 23:40.834
SEEMS THEY'RE NOW LOCKED IN AN

23:40.900 --> 23:42.300
ARMS RACE FOR FUNDS.

23:42.367 --> 23:43.533
WHICH JUST CANNOT BE THE

23:43.600 --> 23:45.233
HEALTHIEST WAY FOR THIS SYSTEM

23:45.300 --> 23:45.967
TO OPERATE.

23:46.033 --> 23:47.000
NAUGHTY RAGA!

23:47.066 --> 23:49.567
NAUGHTY DAGA!

23:49.633 --> 23:51.433
IF YOU KEEP BEHAVING LIKE THAT,%

23:51.500 --> 23:52.266
YOUR PARENTS WILL SELL YOU TO

23:52.333 --> 23:55.033
THE SEA WITCH LIKE YOUR SISTERS!

23:55.100 --> 23:56.233
NOW, INTERESTINGLY, RUTLEDGE IS

23:56.300 --> 23:57.700
ONE OF THE A-G'S UP FOR ELECTION

23:57.767 --> 24:01.066
ON NOVEMBER 6.

24:01.133 --> 24:01.667
AS IS POSSIBLE PEN THIEF, KEN

24:01.734 --> 24:03.100
PAXTON.

24:03.166 --> 24:04.600
AND IF YOU LIVE IN ANY OF

24:04.667 --> 24:06.266
STATES, YOU'VE GOT AN A-G

24:06.333 --> 24:09.000
RACE TO VOTE FOR, AND IT'S WORTH

24:09.066 --> 24:10.367
TAKING A FEW MINUTES TO RESEARCH

24:10.433 --> 24:13.433
THE CANDIDATES.

24:13.500 --> 24:15.100
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE

24:15.166 --> 24:16.533
WHO DO ACTUALLY VOTE END UP

24:16.600 --> 24:18.066
LEAVING THE A-G BOX ON THE

24:18.133 --> 24:19.934
BALLOT EMPTY, SO YOUR VOTE FOR

24:20.000 --> 24:21.266
A-G MAY TECHNICALLY BE EVEN MORE

24:21.333 --> 24:22.600
VALUABLE.

24:22.667 --> 24:24.667
IN TEXAS, ONE POLL SHOWED THAT

24:24.734 --> 24:28.066
39% OF REGISTERED VOTERS DIDN'T

24:28.133 --> 24:30.066
NAME WHO THEY WOULD VOTE FOR FOR

24:30.133 --> 24:31.867
A-G, BECAUSE THEY -- AND I QUOTE

24:31.967 --> 24:34.100
-- "HAVEN'T THOUGHT ENOUGH ABOUT

24:34.166 --> 24:34.266
IT."

24:34.333 --> 24:35.133
WHICH SOUNDS TERRIBLE, BUT

24:35.200 --> 24:36.166
THAT'S ACTUALLY A CAUSE FOR

24:36.233 --> 24:37.133
GENUINE HOPE.

24:37.200 --> 24:38.300
BECAUSE REMEMBER, THAT'S WHERE

24:38.367 --> 24:40.633
KEN PAXTON IS RUNNING.

24:40.700 --> 24:42.333
AND IF THERE'S ONE THING SURE TO

24:42.400 --> 24:43.333
DAMAGE KEN PAXTON'S REPUTATION,

24:43.400 --> 24:44.700
IT'S AN AWARENESS OF KEN

24:44.767 --> 24:48.600
PAXTON'S REPUTATION.

24:48.667 --> 24:50.333
SO, PLEASE, BEFORE NOVEMBER 6,

24:50.400 --> 24:52.567
JUST THINK ABOUT YOUR A-G RACE.

24:52.633 --> 24:54.033
YOU CAN DO IT.

24:54.100 --> 24:56.200
YOU'VE GOT NINE DAYS LEFT.

24:56.266 --> 24:57.233
AND I KNOW WE'VE ALL BEEN ASKED

24:57.300 --> 24:58.533
TO THINK ABOUT A LOT THIS YEAR

24:58.600 --> 24:59.834
-- FROM SUPREME COURT

24:59.900 --> 25:01.800
NOMINATIONS TO GUN CONTROL

25:01.867 --> 25:02.667
TO THE ENERGY OF PETE DAVIDSON'S

25:02.734 --> 25:06.500
PENIS.

25:06.567 --> 25:08.066
AND NOW I'M ADDING "RESEARCH

25:08.133 --> 25:08.734
YOUR STATE A-G RACE" TO YOUR

25:08.800 --> 25:10.033
LIST.

25:10.100 --> 25:11.200
BUT IT'S HONESTLY WORTH IT.

25:11.266 --> 25:13.000
ALSO, IF YOU DO IT, YOU'D BE

25:13.066 --> 25:14.166
AMAZED AT THE KIND

25:14.233 --> 25:16.333
OF TIDBITS YOU MIGHT FIND.

25:16.400 --> 25:17.734
IF YOU LIVE IN WISCONSIN, GOOGLE

25:17.800 --> 25:19.066
"BRAD SCHIMEL $10,000 COINS",

25:19.133 --> 25:21.100
AND YOU'LL LEARN ABOUT HOW YOUR

25:21.166 --> 25:22.900
A-G MANAGED TO SPEND 10 GRAND OF

25:22.967 --> 25:26.800
TAXPAYER MONEY ON COINS READING

25:26.867 --> 25:28.233
"K.A.E.D.", WHICH STANDS FOR HIS

25:28.300 --> 25:29.967
ACTUAL PERSONAL MOTTO,

25:30.033 --> 25:32.333
"KICKING ASS EVERY DAY."

25:32.400 --> 25:34.700
IF YOU LIVE IN ARKANSAS, GOOGLE

25:34.767 --> 25:37.266

25:37.333 --> 25:38.433
SO YOU CAN SEE OUR FRIEND FROM

25:38.500 --> 25:39.700

25:39.767 --> 25:42.400

26:01.233 --> 26:02.667
"SING IT, LESLIE"?

26:02.734 --> 26:03.533
I'M NOT SURE THAT'S

26:03.600 --> 26:04.800
ENCOURAGEMENT.

26:04.867 --> 26:06.033
I THINK THAT'S AN HONEST PLEA.

26:06.100 --> 26:07.967
SING IT, LESLIE.

26:08.033 --> 26:09.166
DON'T JUST DRONE IT

INCONSISTENT VOLUME.

26:12.266 --> 26:12.767
THE BAND'S IN E-MAJOR, AND

26:12.834 --> 26:14.166
YOU'RE IN "H".

26:14.233 --> 26:15.367
TRY TO BRING IT INTO THE KNOWN

26:15.433 --> 26:18.600
MUSICAL UNIVERSE.

26:18.667 --> 26:20.166
AND IF YOU'RE IN MICHIGAN --

AND EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT -- PLEASE

26:26.700 --> 26:27.367
"BILL SCHUETTE 1989 VIDEO."

26:27.433 --> 26:28.033
HE'S THEIR CURRENT A-G, BUT HE'S

26:28.100 --> 26:28.633
NOT ACTUALLY UP FOR ELECTION,

26:28.700 --> 26:29.133
BECAUSE HE'S RUNNING FOR

26:29.200 --> 26:29.734
GOVERNOR.

26:29.800 --> 26:30.567
BUT IT'S STILL WORTH GOOGLING

26:30.633 --> 26:32.233
THAT, SO YOU CAN WATCH HIM

26:32.300 --> 26:33.033
CREEPILY HITTING ON A WOMAN

26:33.100 --> 26:34.800
BEHIND THE CAMERA.

26:34.867 --> 26:35.834
>> WOULD YOU PLEASE MOVE

26:35.900 --> 26:37.166
CLOSER TO THE LAMP?

26:37.233 --> 26:37.934
>> I WOULD BE HAPPY TO MOVE

26:38.000 --> 26:41.800
CLOSER TO THE LAMP.

26:41.867 --> 26:45.467
I WILL DO ANYTHING YOU WANT.

26:45.533 --> 26:46.967
SOME THINGS I MAY NOT LET

26:47.033 --> 26:49.100
YOU RUN THE CAMERA ON.

26:49.166 --> 26:51.734
>> I ADMIRE YOUR TENACITY,

APPRECIATE YOUR SPIRIT OF

VINCENT VAN GOGH, REMBRANDT, AND

26:56.734 --> 26:58.667
TOULOUSELAUTREC.

26:58.734 --> 27:01.800
>> John: OOF.

27:01.867 --> 27:07.166
THAT IS ROUGHGH TO WATCH.

27:07.233 --> 27:08.166
I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT PRODUCER

27:08.233 --> 27:08.700
GOT THROUGH THE INTERVIEW

27:08.767 --> 27:09.266
WITHOUT PUNCHING HIM IN THE

27:09.333 --> 27:13.800
DIGHGH.

27:13.867 --> 27:15.567
MY POINT IS, TAKING TWO MINUTES

27:15.633 --> 27:17.734
TO RESEARCH YOUR STATE A-G IS A

27:17.800 --> 27:19.133
VALUABLE USE OF TIME.

27:19.200 --> 27:20.367
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING YOU DON'T

27:20.433 --> 27:20.967
HAVE TWO MINUTES YOU ACTUALLY

27:21.033 --> 27:22.533
DO.

27:22.600 --> 27:24.233
IT'S 11:28 RIGHT NOW.

27:24.300 --> 27:25.467
I'M NOT SAYING GOODBYE UNTIL

27:25.533 --> 27:27.367
11:30.

27:27.433 --> 27:30.400
SO GO TO VOTE411.ORG RIGHT NOW,

27:30.467 --> 27:31.467
WHERE YOU CAN FIND OUT IF

27:31.533 --> 27:32.533
THERE'S AN ELECTION IN YOUR

27:32.600 --> 27:33.734
STATE, AND IF SO, WHO YOUR A-G

27:33.800 --> 27:35.433
CANDIDATES ARE.

27:35.500 --> 27:36.767
SERIOUSLY, DO IT NOW.

27:36.834 --> 27:38.500
YOU WON'T BE MISSING ANYTHING.

27:38.567 --> 27:40.000
I PROMISE, NOTHING ENTERTAINING

27:40.066 --> 27:40.967
IS GOING TO HAPPEN FOR THE REST

27:41.033 --> 27:42.800
OF THE SHOW.

27:42.867 --> 27:44.367
IN FACT, TO HELP DRIVE YOU AWAY,

27:44.433 --> 27:46.533
FOR THE REST OF THIS BROADCAST,

27:46.600 --> 27:47.867
A BAGPIPER WILL BE PLAYING

27:47.934 --> 27:50.967
LESLIE RUTLEDGE'S FAVORITE SONG,

27:51.033 --> 27:54.734
"SHE THINKS MY TRACTOR'S SEXY".

27:54.800 --> 27:57.100
TAKE IT AWAY.

28:03.867 --> 28:09.567
>> John: OH, GOD.

28:09.633 --> 28:10.467
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THE BAGPIPES

28:10.533 --> 28:11.333
MAKE THIS SONG EVEN MORE

28:11.400 --> 28:12.533
UNLISTENABLE THAN IT ALREADY IS.

28:12.600 --> 28:13.133
THAT IS AN UNGODLY NOISE -- NO

28:13.200 --> 28:15.233
DISRESPECT.

28:15.300 --> 28:16.300
TURN THIS SHOW OFF AND RESEARCH

28:16.367 --> 28:17.900
YOUR A-G.

28:17.967 --> 28:21.233
AND IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY BEEN

28:21.300 --> 28:22.367
REPELLED INTO ACTION, I'LL ADD

28:22.433 --> 28:26.834
AN ACCORDION INTO THE MIX.

28:26.900 --> 28:29.633
OH, YES.

28:31.033 --> 28:32.066
>> John: AH, THE SWEET, SWEET

28:32.133 --> 28:33.066
SOUND OF A BAGPIPEACCORDION

28:33.133 --> 28:33.867
DUET.

28:33.934 --> 28:34.667
TWO SOUNDS THAT GO TOGETHER LIKE

28:34.734 --> 28:36.767
POP-TARTS AND FISH.

28:36.834 --> 28:39.400
GO TO VOTE411.ORG RIGHT NOW,

28:39.467 --> 28:40.467
BECAUSE I PROMISE, THIS ISN'T

28:40.533 --> 28:42.367
GOING TO GET ANY BETTER.

28:42.433 --> 28:44.767
DON'T FUCKING PUSH ME ON THIS.

28:44.834 --> 28:46.000
YOU THINK I WON'T ADD A THEREMIN

28:46.066 --> 28:47.934
TO THIS?

28:48.900 --> 28:49.467
>> John: THINK AGAIN,

28:49.533 --> 28:52.834
MOTHERFUCKERS.

28:52.900 --> 28:56.567
DON'T TRY ME.

28:56.633 --> 28:57.367
YOU SHOULDN'T BE WATCHING THIS

28:57.433 --> 28:57.967
SHOW ANYMORE.

28:58.033 --> 28:58.700
I'M SLIGHTLY DISAPPOINTED OUR

28:58.767 --> 28:59.900
LIVE AUDIENCE IS STILL HERE.

28:59.967 --> 29:00.467
RACHAEL RAY IS NOT COMING!

29:00.533 --> 29:01.100
YOU'VE BEEN BETRAYED!

29:01.166 --> 29:01.900
THERE WERE NEVER GOING TO BE

29:01.967 --> 29:04.033
FRITATTAS!

29:04.100 --> 29:04.867
BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHO IS COMING,

29:04.934 --> 29:06.934
THOUGH.

29:07.000 --> 29:07.533
>> John: SIX CHILDREN PLAYING

29:07.600 --> 29:09.533
THE RECORDER!

29:14.133 --> 29:16.633
OH, MY GOD.

29:16.700 --> 29:17.667
HOW ARE YOU SOMEHOW THE WORST

29:17.734 --> 29:18.633
INGREDIENT IN ALL THIS?

29:18.700 --> 29:19.266
GO RESEARCH YOUR A-G'S, BECAUSE

29:19.333 --> 29:20.367
THEY'RE ABOUT TO GET LOUDER!

29:20.433 --> 29:22.000
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

29:22.066 --> 29:26.767
THANKS SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

29:26.834 --> 29:29.967
SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.
