11:45.956 --> 11:47.321
Have you told Nathan?

11:47.457 --> 11:49.288
No.

11:51.295 --> 11:53.126
No.

11:59.094 --> 12:01.961
Her name's Jemma Greene ——
renovates commercial properties,

12:02.097 --> 12:04.008
best friends with our last victim.

12:04.141 --> 12:05.847
Phone records show
she was talking to Abby

12:05.976 --> 12:07.807
just before the attack.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.600
We'd been best friends
since the day we were born.

12:12.733 --> 12:15.395
[ Crying ] | just can't believe
someone would do that to her.

12:15.527 --> 12:17.438
Someone or something?

12:17.571 --> 12:19.857
Hey, you two, out.

12:19.990 --> 12:22.151
This is an active
police investigation.

12:22.284 --> 12:24.696
Hey, you guys, smile for the camera
while you're oppressing our rights.

12:24.828 --> 12:26.193
And arresting you?
Okay, I will.

12:26.330 --> 12:27.365
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

12:27.497 --> 12:29.874
Calm down.
Okay?

12:30.000 --> 12:33.083
Look, I don't think anybody's
gonna have to get arrested

12:33.211 --> 12:36.920
because that camera
looks broken to me.

12:37.049 --> 12:38.880
Oh, you playing bad cop today,
ponytail?

12:39.009 --> 12:40.749
Just keep rolling.
He can't arrest us.

12:40.886 --> 12:42.092
Yeah, I know he can't arrest us,

12:42.220 --> 12:43.676
which is why
I'm gonna keep exercising

12:43.805 --> 12:45.386
my first—amendment right
of free speech

12:45.515 --> 12:46.891
and ask you, Mr. Ponytail,

12:47.017 --> 12:49.383
don't you feel like grunge
died in the '90s?

12:50.687 --> 12:53.178
Really?
I'm trying to be nice to you.

12:53.315 --> 12:54.350
[Mockingly]
"I'm just trying to be nice to you."

12:54.483 --> 12:55.689
Okay, I'm gonna kick his ass now.

12:55.817 --> 12:57.523
Give me that camera.
Give me that camera!

12:57.653 --> 12:58.733
[Device beeping]

12:58.862 --> 13:00.068
Give me that camera!

13:00.197 --> 13:01.562
[Electricity sizzles]

13:01.698 --> 13:04.360
Okay, okay, okay.

13:04.493 --> 13:06.404
Don't shoot anymore.

13:06.536 --> 13:07.912
It's not rolling.
[Clattering]

13:08.038 --> 13:09.869
Shh, shh, shh.

13:09.998 --> 13:12.375
Everyone just stay calm,
try to be quiet.

13:12.501 --> 13:14.708
—Okay, okay, okay.
—Let's get out the back.

13:14.836 --> 13:17.543
I'll take the lead.
Duke, here...

13:18.423 --> 13:20.163
Thanks.

13:21.093 --> 13:22.333
—Ready?
—Yeah.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.925
Let's get out the back.
I like this plan.

13:24.054 --> 13:26.170
I'll follow you.

13:28.517 --> 13:30.428
Let's go.

13:31.645 --> 13:33.385
Wait, wait.

13:33.522 --> 13:36.389
Wait. I think it's gone.

13:36.525 --> 13:38.140
Are you sure?

13:38.276 --> 13:40.483
Okay.
Let's get out of here.

13:40.612 --> 13:42.443
Go, go, go, go, go.

13:42.572 --> 13:44.358
[Creature roars]

13:46.410 --> 13:48.275
—What is that?
—Where is it? Where is it?

13:48.412 --> 13:49.822
—What is it?
—Shh, shh, shh.

13:49.955 --> 13:52.116
Okay, okay.

13:52.249 --> 13:55.082
—[ Creature growls]
—Get down. Get down.

13:55.210 --> 13:57.075
[Gunshots]

13:57.212 --> 13:58.122
Go! Go!

13:58.255 --> 14:00.337
—Oh, my God!
—Keep going!

14:00.465 --> 14:02.547
Come on! Come on!

14:02.676 --> 14:04.212
Get down! Get down!

14:06.555 --> 14:08.261
Where the hell is it?

14:08.390 --> 14:09.846
All right, all right,
we got to go.

14:09.975 --> 14:11.511
Come on, let's go.
That way.

14:11.643 --> 14:13.144
It's okay.

14:13.270 --> 14:16.558
[Screams]

14:16.690 --> 14:17.975
Jemma, where are you?

14:18.108 --> 14:19.473
Nathan! Nathan!

14:19.609 --> 14:20.644
[Loud crash]

14:20.777 --> 14:21.857
[Creature growling]

14:21.987 --> 14:23.397
Shh, shh.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.737
—Where's Jemma?
—She was with you.

14:25.866 --> 14:27.151
I lost her.

14:27.284 --> 14:30.401
Nathan, I think
I found the breaker box.

14:39.963 --> 14:42.124
There she is.

14:44.676 --> 14:47.463
What was that?

14:57.022 --> 15:00.139
Call it in.
I'll see what else I can find.

15:09.159 --> 15:10.740
You two all right?

15:11.536 --> 15:13.197
Is she dead?

15:15.165 --> 15:16.621
You record any of it?

15:17.834 --> 15:21.497
Uh, no. |, uh...

15:23.173 --> 15:25.755
l was so scared, l'm...

15:25.884 --> 15:27.749
Lucky I didn't break the camera.

15:28.553 --> 15:30.384
Right.

15:36.812 --> 15:38.393
That was crazy.

15:38.522 --> 15:41.229
I mean, that thing
just went right for her.

15:41.358 --> 15:43.895
And when we got separated,
| just...

15:44.027 --> 15:45.233
ljust panicked.

15:45.362 --> 15:47.398
Hey, Seth.

15:47.531 --> 15:49.613
—Yeah.
—Look at this.

15:51.326 --> 15:52.691
Wait. You got it?

15:52.828 --> 15:54.944
Damn right.
I was up and running.

15:55.080 --> 15:57.867
Look at that thing.

15:59.042 --> 16:02.375
—We got it on camera.
—Yeah.

16:08.301 --> 16:11.088
—So this arugula...
—Rougarou.

16:11.221 --> 16:13.587
—And we don't know that.
—Oh.

16:13.723 --> 16:15.759
Well, what we do know
is what it wants,

16:15.892 --> 16:18.429
and that is hearts.

16:18.562 --> 16:20.974
These other wounds
like the gashed forearm,

16:21.106 --> 16:23.939
the missing fingers ——
they're just defensive.

16:25.569 --> 16:26.558
Why the heart?

16:26.695 --> 16:28.902
That's your job, Detective.
| just figure out the what.

16:29.030 --> 16:33.444
The why —— that's up to you and, uh,
your honorary deputy over there.

16:33.577 --> 16:35.317
I actually prefer
consulting detective.

16:35.453 --> 16:36.954
Oh, a Sherlock fan.

16:37.080 --> 16:40.618
Well, what does your deductive
reasoning make of this?

16:40.750 --> 16:43.708
Traces found in all the victims.

16:44.379 --> 16:46.335
I'm gonna go with blood, Bob.

16:46.464 --> 16:47.670
Well, you'd be 90% right.

16:47.799 --> 16:49.539
But there's other stuff
mixed in there,

16:49.676 --> 16:52.338
and I'm trying to separate it out
with a centrifuge.

16:52.470 --> 16:56.088
lt's thicker than blood, sticky ——
maybe saliva?

16:56.224 --> 16:58.465
I don't know,
but it's from the troubled person...

16:59.728 --> 17:02.936
...which is why I've already put him
for a rush on the DNA test.

17:03.064 --> 17:04.349
Thank you, Gloria.

17:04.482 --> 17:05.517
You got it.

17:05.650 --> 17:07.311
The people have a right...

17:07.444 --> 17:10.356
—Those little twerps.
—Hey.

17:10.488 --> 17:12.069
I will handle this.
You'd just make things worse.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.860
Meet me at the station.

17:13.992 --> 17:16.028
I wasn't gonna do anything.

17:16.161 --> 17:17.571
You want to see something cool?

17:22.626 --> 17:25.493
So where's the freedom fighter ——
out seeking the truth?

17:25.629 --> 17:26.869
Thai food —— he gets hungry.

17:27.005 --> 17:27.869
What do you want?

17:28.006 --> 17:30.338
Look, I saw the thing.
I know the truth.

17:30.467 --> 17:31.832
I know what you're covering up
in there.

17:31.968 --> 17:33.879
And hold on a second.
People, man ——

17:34.012 --> 17:37.345
The people have a right
to know the truth as well.

17:37.474 --> 17:38.884
The truth is there's
a deep, dark pond off Route 9.

17:39.017 --> 17:40.348
Nobody goes there.
Your buddy's not here.

17:40.477 --> 17:42.183
Why don't we see
if you can swim, huh?

17:42.312 --> 17:45.099
Hey, hey, you know you're not
getting in there, right?

17:45.232 --> 17:48.349
Yeah. And at this point,
I don't care.

17:48.485 --> 17:50.021
You know why?

17:50.153 --> 17:52.610
Because we have the footage.

17:52.822 --> 17:57.031
We have real, actual footage
of a supernatural monster.

17:57.160 --> 17:58.366
And you know what else?

17:58.495 --> 17:59.450
And...
[Chuckles]

17:59.579 --> 18:01.035
You are really gonna love this.

18:01.164 --> 18:03.371
We have recordings
of conversations

18:03.500 --> 18:05.331
among Haven law enforcement

18:05.460 --> 18:07.701
discussing a conspiracy
to cover it up.

18:07.837 --> 18:10.874
[Laughs]
Can you believe that?

18:11.007 --> 18:12.872
So what I'm proposing is this ——

18:13.009 --> 18:15.842
We form kind of like a partnership?

18:15.971 --> 18:17.632
You let us tag around on the case.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.846
We get enough footage
to finish the episode,

18:19.975 --> 18:23.342
and then this little
illegal conversation of yours ——

18:23.478 --> 18:26.595
it just accidentally gets left
on the cutting room floor.

18:35.532 --> 18:36.863
Here's my offer.

18:36.992 --> 18:38.528
We take your equipment,
put it on the ground,

18:38.660 --> 18:40.525
and you watch, politely,

18:40.662 --> 18:43.449
as l smash every piece of it.

18:43.581 --> 18:45.993
From there, we grab your buddy
on the way to the edge of town,

18:46.126 --> 18:48.082
and we light your van on fire.

18:48.211 --> 18:49.712
And if you don't like that plan,

18:49.838 --> 18:52.420
I can always leave you
inside the van. Deal?

18:52.549 --> 18:53.914
Go ahead.
Smash my stuff.

18:54.050 --> 18:55.881
And anyways, it doesn't matter
because all of our footage

18:56.011 --> 18:59.549
is just automatically uploaded
onto a secure server on the Cloud.

18:59.681 --> 19:00.921
So, sorry, buddy.

19:01.057 --> 19:03.218
Dwight, just calm down.

19:03.351 --> 19:04.511
Okay, I'm good.

19:05.395 --> 19:06.931
—What?
—|'m done pissing him off.

19:07.063 --> 19:08.439
l was just trying
to get under his skin

19:08.565 --> 19:09.725
so that he'd slip up and let us know

19:09.858 --> 19:11.189
where they're uploading
their footage.

19:11.318 --> 19:12.774
I can have Jennifer
digging through those files

19:12.902 --> 19:14.312
by the time we get to the station.

19:14.863 --> 19:16.273
Jennifer can do that?

19:16.406 --> 19:18.943
As far as I can tell, everyone
younger than me can do that.

19:23.788 --> 19:26.120
How's she doing?

19:26.249 --> 19:30.618
Still in surgery.
She's through the rough patch.

19:31.546 --> 19:33.286
How are you doing?

19:33.423 --> 19:35.664
[Scoffs]
Right.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.916
Fine.

19:40.972 --> 19:42.633
Look, | just...

19:42.766 --> 19:45.633
I don't know.
Today, it's a phantom bullet.

19:45.769 --> 19:47.976
Before that, she was stuck
in an alternate reality.

19:48.104 --> 19:49.480
Every day I wake up, I think,

19:49.606 --> 19:51.813
"Today is gonna be the day
that I'm gonna lose her."

19:51.941 --> 19:54.432
But you haven't lost her.

19:55.653 --> 19:59.111
Look, Nathan,
she is tough as nails.

19:59.240 --> 20:01.572
More importantly, she has us.

20:01.701 --> 20:05.444
She has you to protect her.

20:05.580 --> 20:07.787
That's just it.

20:10.960 --> 20:15.499
I don't know if I know how
to protect her anymore.

20:15.632 --> 20:17.918
—What are you talking about?
_| __

20:18.051 --> 20:19.916
William.

20:20.053 --> 20:22.169
Her and William.

20:23.973 --> 20:27.966
How can I protect her against that?

20:28.103 --> 20:29.218
How can I compete with that?

20:29.354 --> 20:31.094
Hey, let me explain
something to you.

20:31.231 --> 20:34.689
In case you've forgotten,
she went into that barn.

20:34.818 --> 20:36.854
She sacrificed herself

20:36.986 --> 20:41.070
for the one person
that she loved most in this world.

20:42.534 --> 20:44.070
That's you, buddy.

20:44.202 --> 20:46.363
William ——
He knows everything about her.

20:47.789 --> 20:51.122
They have this connection.

20:53.670 --> 20:55.206
He doesn't know Audrey.

20:55.338 --> 20:57.044
You know Audrey.

20:57.173 --> 21:01.963
So can we please figure out
what the hell is growing claws

21:02.095 --> 21:04.211
and howling at the moon
here in Haven?

21:04.347 --> 21:05.678
Do something to help her.

21:10.478 --> 21:11.809
Victims aren't random.

21:11.938 --> 21:13.678
Abby and Jemma
knew each other forever.

21:13.815 --> 21:15.396
They talked on the phone every day.

21:15.525 --> 21:19.188
What about this other guy —— Hank?
How does ——

21:19.320 --> 21:20.605
How does he fit in?

21:20.738 --> 21:22.114
His birthday.

21:22.240 --> 21:23.730
Jemma said her and Abby
were best friends

21:23.867 --> 21:25.403
since the day
they were born, right?

21:25.535 --> 21:26.399
So I looked into it.

21:26.536 --> 21:28.572
They were both born
in Haven hospital on the same day ——

21:28.705 --> 21:29.911
same day as Hank, too.

21:30.039 --> 21:30.994
What day?

21:31.124 --> 21:32.864
June12, 1981.

21:33.001 --> 21:34.582
June '81.

21:34.711 --> 21:36.417
When the troubles
started up last time.

21:36.546 --> 21:37.410
Call Haven hospital.

21:37.547 --> 21:38.707
See if anyone else
was born on that day.

21:38.840 --> 21:40.751
Hopefully we can get to them
before our trouble person.

21:40.884 --> 21:42.920
Hey!

21:43.052 --> 21:45.134
We just celebrated
Jennifer's birthday ——

21:46.598 --> 21:47.587
June 12th.

21:47.724 --> 21:49.055
Where is she?

21:49.184 --> 21:50.390
Haven Hera/d.

21:51.060 --> 21:52.721
Let's go!

21:54.731 --> 21:56.892
[Bell ringing]

22:00.028 --> 22:02.064
Jennﬁen

22:07.660 --> 22:09.867
Jennﬁen

22:16.252 --> 22:17.537
Duke.

22:18.588 --> 22:19.668
Duke.

22:19.797 --> 22:22.504
Would you stop saying my name
and just help me?

22:22.634 --> 22:24.875
Just calm down, okay?
We've looked around.

22:25.011 --> 22:27.923
There is no blood here,
which means either ——

22:28.056 --> 22:31.469
either Jennifer wasn't here,
or she got away.

22:31.601 --> 22:33.057
I found some more
of that weird saliva stuff

33:09.572 --> 33:10.436
Whoa, whoa.

33:12.366 --> 33:13.276
Are you serious?

33:13.409 --> 33:15.115
First some monster
wants to eat my heart out,

33:15.244 --> 33:17.735
and now I'm some kind
of paranormal phenomenon?

33:17.872 --> 33:19.783
JennWen
where'd you get that book?

33:19.915 --> 33:23.282
This was just in a box of old junk
that my birth parents left behind.

33:23.419 --> 33:24.659
No, that's notjunk.

33:24.795 --> 33:25.784
Seriously, I've read this,

33:25.921 --> 33:27.786
and it makes Twilight
look like Faulkner.

33:27.923 --> 33:31.882
No, l—l gave that to Agent Howard
before I came to Haven.

33:32.011 --> 33:34.343
If you found that
at your birth parents' house,

33:34.471 --> 33:35.256
that means...

33:35.389 --> 33:38.096
Wait, he must have wanted her
to find it.

33:38.225 --> 33:40.932
That's not just
some cheesy paperback.

33:42.062 --> 33:43.598
It's something more.

33:45.149 --> 33:47.606
[Beeping stops]

33:51.780 --> 33:53.941
Okay.
Now what?

33:55.784 --> 33:57.069
I don't want
the magic beeping book.

33:57.203 --> 33:59.535
—You should keep it.
—Please, Jennifer.

33:59.663 --> 34:02.655
Agent Howard is somehow linked
to this barn,

34:02.791 --> 34:05.624
and now this book,
and now you.

34:05.753 --> 34:07.289
Guys, we should go.

34:10.090 --> 34:12.752
[E.P.G. beeping frenetically]

34:12.885 --> 34:17.003

[E.P.G. beeping rapidly]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:20.351 --> 34:21.636
Everyone stay together!

34:21.769 --> 34:22.975
Again with the lights?

34:23.103 --> 34:25.185
Anderson, give me that camera.
Use the other one.

34:25.314 --> 34:26.178
—You up?
—Yeah.

34:26.315 --> 34:27.065
Keep rolling.

34:27.191 --> 34:29.648
—Yeah, I'm rolling.
—Just keep rolling.

—This way!
—Over here.

34:40.329 --> 34:41.239
Oh, God.

34:41.372 --> 34:42.782
—|s he okay?
—Yeah, he's all right.

34:42.915 --> 34:44.530
Anderson, go with them.
I'll distract it.

34:44.667 --> 34:46.953
—Go, go.
—Over here!

34:47.086 --> 34:47.745
You sure?

34:47.878 --> 34:49.379
He's all right.
He's just out cold.

34:49.505 --> 34:51.336

It wants Jennifer.

Hey, you overgrown fur ball,

No, we're not gonna let it.

See, there seems to be
some kind of connection

35:12.611 --> 35:13.361
between you and the book.

35:13.487 --> 35:14.693
Okay, maybe those readings ——

35:14.822 --> 35:16.938

find a way to stop it.

Not "Bigfoot"?

I'm serious.
How is he?

37:01.261 --> 37:04.799
Paramedics said he'll be fine.
It's just a mild concussion.

37:06.266 --> 37:08.302
What the hell
happened in there, huh?

37:08.435 --> 37:12.394
Maybe the opposing frequencies
created a compressed static field,

poof maybe?

out of this, Detective.

we have in the book ——

laughable passwords...

to wrap his head around it,

he'll feel the same way.

40:03.485 --> 40:05.396
All things considered, I'm fine,

40:05.529 --> 40:07.895
but, yeah, still confused.

40:08.031 --> 40:11.740
This book —— you guys seriously
can't see The Guard symbol?

40:13.537 --> 40:17.655
It's orange. It's glowing.
How can you guys not see this?

40:17.791 --> 40:19.497
lt's meant just for you.

40:19.626 --> 40:21.537
That's why even I can't see it.

40:21.670 --> 40:23.706
Maybe it's a message
from Agent Howard.

40:23.839 --> 40:24.703
What does it mean?

40:24.840 --> 40:26.831
Why is The Guard symbol
on the cover of that book?

40:48.989 --> 40:51.150
that probably means
William does, too.

He killed innocent people

40:55.495 --> 40:58.578
and made it look like a trouble
all just to get to Jennifer.

Hey, guys, come here.

41:01.501 --> 41:03.992
I found something.
I think it's like a riddle.

and it started glowing.

41:06.798 --> 41:08.959
"In times of great evil,

41:13.764 --> 41:16.301
Sounds like a creepy Zeppelin lyric.

41:16.433 --> 41:17.889
What's a child of ruin?

41:19.269 --> 41:20.770
I think it's me.

41:20.896 --> 41:23.353
That's why William
wants you dead, because ——

41:23.482 --> 41:26.849
Because I can summon the door.

41:26.985 --> 41:28.976
And send William through it.

41:29.571 --> 41:30.936
To where?
