00:02.567 --> 00:05.570
There are over 6 billion
people on planet Earth.

00:06.292 --> 00:08.727
Ordinary folks
like you and me,

00:09.058 --> 00:10.759
but if you look around
carefully,

00:11.087 --> 00:13.673
you might find that some
of these ordinary folks

00:13.707 --> 00:15.677
have extraordinary abilities.

00:16.703 --> 00:19.639
I call them Alphas.

00:19.671 --> 00:21.972
Some Alphas,
like the ones I work with,

00:22.006 --> 00:24.338
can do things
that would amaze you.

00:26.740 --> 00:30.573
Others--the angry,
the lost, the afraid--

00:30.608 --> 00:34.582
have abilities that frankly
can be terrifying.

Ah!

02:12.344 --> 02:15.580
Hello.

02:15.615 --> 02:17.617
I'd like to report
an accident.

02:57.497 --> 03:00.165
I can't believe you already
have your office done.

03:00.200 --> 03:03.235
You know, it's easy to get
people to do things for me.

03:03.269 --> 03:06.738
Yeah, it is.

03:06.773 --> 03:08.974
Hey, do you think
I could take this office?

03:09.008 --> 03:11.677
We could be neighbors.
Sure.

03:13.780 --> 03:15.581
Oh, you don't want
to be neighbors.

03:15.616 --> 03:17.818
Oh, I can find another office.
No, it's fine.

03:17.852 --> 03:19.419
- It's okay.
- It's fine. It's just...

03:19.454 --> 03:21.421
I mean, Queens, seriously?

03:21.456 --> 03:24.091
There's, like, a million vacant
offices in Lower Manhattan.

03:24.126 --> 03:25.526
I could walk to work.

03:39.708 --> 03:42.043
Ugh.
Man, I need to clean.

03:47.082 --> 03:48.349
Watch your back, ladies.

03:50.385 --> 03:51.719
You okay?

03:51.753 --> 03:53.520
Gary, how's this?

03:53.555 --> 03:55.055
No, there's a hum.
It's still humming.

03:55.090 --> 03:56.624
Gary,
how can there be a hum?

03:56.658 --> 03:59.427
I haven't even plugged
the damn thing in yet.

04:01.096 --> 04:04.399
I hear
fluorescent lightbulbs,

04:04.433 --> 04:06.935
Bill's stomach
digesting his breakfast,

04:06.970 --> 04:08.737
but no hum, Gary.
Okay, there you go.

04:08.771 --> 04:10.472
No. Yes, there's a hum
in my head.

04:10.507 --> 04:12.441
I don't know
where it's coming from.

04:12.476 --> 04:15.111
The old offices were perfect.
There was no hum.

04:15.145 --> 04:16.112
I'm with Gary.

04:16.147 --> 04:17.579
I mean, Brooklyn
I can understand, maybe,

04:17.615 --> 04:18.915
but Queens?
Uh, hello, people.

04:18.949 --> 04:21.084
Someone tried to kill Dr. Rosen
in the old office.

04:21.118 --> 04:23.319
You were trying to kill
Dr. Rosen, Bill.

04:23.354 --> 04:25.922
- Yeah, that was you.
- I was mind-controlled, okay?

04:25.956 --> 04:27.424
Gary, this is where I put it.

04:27.458 --> 04:29.259
This is where it stays.
Drink up.

04:29.293 --> 04:31.094
We wouldn't even be here
if it wasn't for you.

04:31.128 --> 04:32.595
You can't leave that
right there.

04:40.471 --> 04:43.006
- Your parents?
- Yeah.

04:43.040 --> 04:45.208
I thought you weren't gonna
take any calls at the office.

04:45.243 --> 04:47.845
I know. I'm not.
Be strong, Rachel.

04:57.156 --> 04:58.156
Mm.

04:58.190 --> 04:59.992
Yeah, I already told you.

05:00.026 --> 05:01.727
Sunday night is fine.
Yeah.

05:01.762 --> 05:03.362
Sunday night
is fine, mother.

05:03.397 --> 05:04.931
Yes, I'm capable
of dressing--

05:04.965 --> 05:06.833
Yeah, dress myself.

05:06.867 --> 05:08.769
Click, hang up.

05:08.803 --> 05:09.937
Mm.

05:09.971 --> 05:12.639
Bill? Bill?

05:12.674 --> 05:14.742
The humming is back.
It's annoying.

05:14.776 --> 05:17.678
A little privacy, please.

05:23.918 --> 05:26.486
Sorry I'm late.
I, uh, had to drop my kid off.

05:26.520 --> 05:30.189
You're over here...

05:30.224 --> 05:32.658
Your new home.

05:34.494 --> 05:35.994
Not much of a view.

05:36.029 --> 05:40.498
Well, you show up late,
you get what you get.

05:40.532 --> 05:44.602
I'm, uh, not really sure
what to do with an office.

05:44.636 --> 05:46.536
You could decorate.

05:46.570 --> 05:48.705
You're an ex-jock.
Go for sports stuff.

05:48.740 --> 05:50.440
Right. Seriously,
what do we do all day?

05:50.474 --> 05:52.175
We just, uh, sit around
having therapy sessions?

05:52.209 --> 05:54.143
Sometimes,
but most of the time

05:54.178 --> 05:56.145
we spend looking
for other Alphas.

05:56.180 --> 05:57.780
When we find them?

05:57.814 --> 05:59.215
We identify them,

05:59.249 --> 06:01.651
government tracks them,
and some go to the compound.

06:01.685 --> 06:02.818
The compound?

06:02.852 --> 06:04.386
- It's--
- That's not its real name.

06:04.420 --> 06:05.821
She just calls it that.

06:05.856 --> 06:08.557
It's, uh, Binghamton
Special Research Facility.

06:08.592 --> 06:10.226
It's this place
where they send Alphas

06:10.260 --> 06:11.393
who misuse their abilities.

06:11.428 --> 06:13.529
Yeah, a danger to self
or others.

06:13.563 --> 06:16.565
Dr. Rosen says that we don't
have to worry about that.

06:16.599 --> 06:18.233
But you do.
You do, but we don't.

06:18.267 --> 06:19.801
- Gary. Gary.
- Mm.

06:28.943 --> 06:30.744
Excuse me.
Can I help you?

06:30.778 --> 06:31.912
Is Dr. Rosen in?

06:31.946 --> 06:33.780
I've got some extra office keys
for him.

06:33.814 --> 06:35.582
I'll take those.

06:35.616 --> 06:37.517
I should probably give them
to him personally.

06:37.551 --> 06:39.619
- Do you have some I.D.?
- Bonita.

06:39.654 --> 06:41.254
Hi.
Hi.

06:41.289 --> 06:42.956
Uh, uh, Bonita's
a real-estate agent

06:42.990 --> 06:44.090
for the--for the building.

06:44.125 --> 06:46.093
She's been
extremely helpful and...

06:46.127 --> 06:47.127
Well, if she's so helpful,

06:47.161 --> 06:49.095
how about the keypad
entry system

06:49.130 --> 06:51.598
and the lobby
surveillance cameras?

06:51.633 --> 06:53.767
- I-I could look into that.
- I'll walk you out.

06:53.801 --> 06:55.803
Dr. Rosen.

06:55.837 --> 06:59.707
I didn't realize what you do
is so security-conscious.

06:59.741 --> 07:01.375
What do you do exactly?

07:01.409 --> 07:02.710
Uh, self-market research.

07:02.744 --> 07:04.445
We're not
in market research.

07:04.479 --> 07:06.915
It's a cover story.

07:09.585 --> 07:10.819
Uh, by the way,

07:10.853 --> 07:14.055
you left this
at my place last night.

07:14.089 --> 07:16.557
Oh. Uh, ties.

07:16.591 --> 07:19.726
Uh, excuse me.

07:19.760 --> 07:21.894
I'm sorry.
I have to take this.

07:21.929 --> 07:24.063
Call me.

07:30.437 --> 07:31.904
- Lee.
- Dr. Singh.

07:31.939 --> 07:33.439
Thanks for coming
all this way.

07:33.474 --> 07:35.075
You said there's been a--
an escape?

07:35.109 --> 07:36.743
First ever
of a Binghamton patient

07:36.778 --> 07:38.312
from a moving ambulance.

07:38.346 --> 07:40.581
Someone walked away
from this?

07:40.615 --> 07:43.084
The patient's cuffs were
somehow severed

07:43.118 --> 07:45.587
during the crash.

07:45.622 --> 07:46.855
Marcus Ayers?

07:46.890 --> 07:50.426
Got it in one.

07:50.460 --> 07:52.295
And you have no idea
where he is.

07:52.329 --> 07:54.097
I was hoping
he might've contacted you.

07:54.131 --> 07:56.599
Marcus and I haven't talked
for years.

07:56.634 --> 08:00.370
I try every time
I'm up in Binghamton, but...

08:00.404 --> 08:01.804
It's his choice.

08:01.839 --> 08:03.706
Has his mental state
improved at all

08:03.741 --> 08:05.208
in the time
you've been treating him?

08:05.242 --> 08:07.677
If anything,
it's gotten worse--

08:07.711 --> 08:10.213
the ideas of reference,
the persecutory delusions.

08:10.247 --> 08:11.714
Nathan, hello.

08:11.748 --> 08:13.616
Dr. Rosen,
I wasn't expecting you.

08:13.650 --> 08:16.218
I know Marcus.
I know how he thinks.

08:16.253 --> 08:17.553
You're going to need my help.

08:17.587 --> 08:20.122
The situation
feels pretty straightforward.

08:20.156 --> 08:23.025
Got an escaped prisoner--
patient, whatever.

08:23.060 --> 08:25.561
All we got to do is find out
where Marcus is running to,

08:25.596 --> 08:28.064
intercept him.
Marcus doesn't run, Nathan.

08:28.098 --> 08:30.066
That's not his style.

08:30.100 --> 08:32.235
Have you ever played chess
with him?

08:32.269 --> 08:34.003
Marcus plans meticulously.

08:34.037 --> 08:37.174
He thinks through every move,
but he's always attacking.

08:37.207 --> 08:39.808
Marcus sees enemies
everywhere.

08:39.844 --> 08:41.578
And we know what happens
to Marcus' enemies.

08:41.611 --> 08:44.080
If he's broken out,
he's perceived a problem

08:44.114 --> 08:46.582
and has decided to fix it.

08:46.616 --> 08:49.418
The question is,
what's the problem?

08:49.452 --> 08:50.719
Or who?

08:50.753 --> 08:53.755
I'll see what I can do.

09:12.242 --> 09:16.044
It's a simple game--
64 squares, 32 pieces.

09:16.079 --> 09:17.712
Given any position
on the board,

09:17.747 --> 09:19.381
there are only
a few logical moves.

09:19.415 --> 09:23.551
Understand that, and the game
becomes predictable.

09:23.585 --> 09:25.386
Well, you're...

09:25.420 --> 09:28.388
You're not taking
the human factor into account.

09:28.423 --> 09:31.058
People don't always make
the perfect move.

09:31.092 --> 09:32.393
They do, though.

09:32.427 --> 09:36.697
For them,
it's their perfect move.

09:36.732 --> 09:38.400
Well, now we're...

09:38.434 --> 09:41.570
We're getting to the heart
of what we've been working on--

09:41.604 --> 09:43.239
you believe that everything

09:43.273 --> 09:45.908
that happens in your life
has intent,

09:45.943 --> 09:49.913
that there are no accidents
or no mistakes.

09:49.947 --> 09:52.582
Life isn't like that, Marcus.

09:52.617 --> 09:56.119
It's, uh, sometimes
it's a flip of the coin.

09:58.788 --> 10:01.256
The universe isn't random.

10:01.291 --> 10:03.759
Things happen
because people want them to.

10:03.793 --> 10:06.094
It's just moves...
And forced moves.

10:06.128 --> 10:08.096
Well,
what about you and me?

10:08.130 --> 10:10.164
You didn't choose to be
my patient, did you?

10:10.198 --> 10:12.934
Forced moves.

10:12.968 --> 10:14.469
My roommates don't like me,

10:14.503 --> 10:16.605
so they throw a party
right before finals.

10:16.639 --> 10:18.940
I get angry,
and the police show up.

10:18.975 --> 10:20.442
The judge makes me go
to counseling,

10:20.476 --> 10:21.777
and now I'm here with you.

10:21.811 --> 10:23.278
It's a chain of events--
cause and effect.

10:23.313 --> 10:25.014
You don't really believe

10:25.048 --> 10:27.283
your roommates
planned all of that, do you?

10:27.318 --> 10:30.287
I can see things...

10:30.321 --> 10:32.623
How everything led to this.

10:32.657 --> 10:34.558
How couldn't they?
Why can't you?

10:36.828 --> 10:40.631
Because you're not
like everyone else, Marcus.

10:40.666 --> 10:43.634
Your brain scans revealed a...

10:43.669 --> 10:45.636
A unique neuroanatomy.

10:45.671 --> 10:49.474
That's why I took such
an interest in your case.

10:49.508 --> 10:52.643
I-I'm calling people
like you "Alphas."

10:52.678 --> 10:55.813
Alpha, acceleration,
the first variable--

10:55.847 --> 10:57.281
I like that.

10:57.316 --> 11:00.084
Let me ask you...

11:00.119 --> 11:02.587
Is there anything
out of the ordinary

11:02.622 --> 11:04.389
that--that you can do?

11:53.896 --> 11:55.092
We're on our way home now.

11:55.136 --> 11:56.537
Yeah. No, we're just
leaving the office.

12:00.064 --> 12:03.066
Mom, I never said
that I would marry him.

12:03.100 --> 12:04.901
I said that I would meet him.

12:04.935 --> 12:07.437
Mom. Mom.

12:10.074 --> 12:11.875
Don't say anything.

12:11.909 --> 12:13.543
No, I thought
you handled that well.

12:13.577 --> 12:14.577
No, you didn't.

12:14.612 --> 12:16.212
You--you would've stood
up to her.

12:16.247 --> 12:17.547
You would've been stronger.

12:17.581 --> 12:21.251
Look, I haven't talked
to my mother in years...

12:21.285 --> 12:23.152
or my father or my sister,

12:23.186 --> 12:24.553
so...

12:24.588 --> 12:26.655
I wouldn't use me
as a yardstick for anything.

12:26.690 --> 12:29.258
I don't know.
Maybe you're better off.

12:29.293 --> 12:32.528
That's what I keep trying
to tell myself.

12:34.064 --> 12:37.032
Good luck.

12:44.607 --> 12:47.241
Tough first day?

12:47.276 --> 12:48.943
It'll get better.

12:48.977 --> 12:51.111
You know, my drill sergeant
used to tell me

12:51.146 --> 12:52.613
the exact same thing.

12:52.647 --> 12:55.549
Look, I know you're feeling
pretty useless right now, but--

12:55.584 --> 12:57.518
You don't know anything
about me, Nina.

12:57.552 --> 13:00.220
Well, I know you have
excellent hand-eye coordination.

13:00.254 --> 13:02.722
And Rosen thinks
you belong here.

13:02.757 --> 13:05.358
I'll see you, Hicks.

13:05.393 --> 13:07.527
Nice car.

13:07.561 --> 13:08.995
I borrowed it.

13:14.434 --> 13:16.535
Hi. I'm looking
for Dr. Rosen.

13:16.569 --> 13:18.036
I don't know
what Dr. Rosen told you

13:18.070 --> 13:19.638
over cocktails last night,
but it is not--

13:19.672 --> 13:20.839
Cocktails?

13:20.873 --> 13:22.707
We all know Dr. Rosen's
got some game--

13:22.742 --> 13:26.278
obviously.
Oh, Bill Harken--

13:26.313 --> 13:27.980
right.

13:28.015 --> 13:31.718
I'd shake your hand,
but don't want any broken bones.

13:31.752 --> 13:32.886
Miss Theroux.

13:32.920 --> 13:34.555
No eye contact, please.

13:34.589 --> 13:36.390
Rachel.
Do we know you?

13:36.424 --> 13:39.060
Miss Sullivan, you're early.

13:39.094 --> 13:41.462
Oh, well, we were all
just getting acquainted.

13:41.497 --> 13:42.897
Your cell phone
is encrypted.

13:42.931 --> 13:44.766
That's right, Gary.
It is.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.400
Agent Sullivan is
overseeing our group

13:46.435 --> 13:48.636
while Wilson
is on assignment.

13:48.670 --> 13:49.770
I'm glad you're here.

13:49.805 --> 13:51.505
We need to gather
in the conference room.

13:51.540 --> 13:52.506
We've got a case.

13:52.541 --> 13:53.841
This way, please.

13:53.875 --> 13:55.509
Uh, about that...

13:55.543 --> 13:57.511
You and I
need to talk first...

13:57.545 --> 13:58.579
In private.

13:58.613 --> 13:59.813
According to Marcus' files,

13:59.847 --> 14:02.515
he blames you
for his institutionalization,

14:02.550 --> 14:05.686
which he brought up repeatedly
at Binghamton.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.855
And now you're saying
you think he broke out

14:07.889 --> 14:10.024
with a specific goal in mind.

14:10.058 --> 14:13.194
What's to say
that goal's not you?

14:13.229 --> 14:14.863
Uh, I...

14:14.897 --> 14:19.869
I don't see it, frankly.

14:19.903 --> 14:23.706
Uh, Marcus left me a message...
What?

14:23.740 --> 14:26.207
At the accident site,
and I followed it.

14:26.242 --> 14:27.542
And if Marcus wanted me dead,

14:27.576 --> 14:29.010
I would be.
Wait.

14:29.044 --> 14:30.778
He contacted you, and you
didn't tell anybody about it?

14:30.813 --> 14:32.880
Well, not contacted,
not directly.

14:32.915 --> 14:35.716
He wanted to remind me
of something, uh...

14:35.750 --> 14:37.050
of a place and time.

14:37.084 --> 14:39.052
Okay, so he doesn't want
to kill you,

14:39.086 --> 14:41.721
but apparently you still have
a conflict of interest.

14:41.755 --> 14:44.056
Forgive me, but I don't think
we've known each other

14:44.091 --> 14:46.826
long enough for you to make
that presumption.

14:49.096 --> 14:51.998
All right, this is not
what I was aiming for

14:52.032 --> 14:54.000
between us.

14:54.034 --> 14:55.701
Let's start again.

14:55.735 --> 14:57.837
I have no interest
in playing games.

14:57.871 --> 15:01.007
I won't withhold information
from you without a good reason.

15:01.041 --> 15:03.342
Look, uh,
I wasn't all that happy

15:03.377 --> 15:08.013
when they started
assigning us fieldwork.

15:08.047 --> 15:10.849
That's not what I had in mind
for my--for my group--

15:10.883 --> 15:12.684
working under Don Wilson,

15:12.718 --> 15:16.086
finding people for Cley
and his tactical teams.

15:16.121 --> 15:21.025
But apparently
that's the reality now.

15:21.059 --> 15:23.927
So let us do our work.

15:23.961 --> 15:28.399
Marcus has the ability
to predict and even control

15:28.434 --> 15:31.169
cause and effect
in the physical world.

15:31.203 --> 15:34.373
He can create
elaborate chains of events--

15:34.407 --> 15:38.879
drop a coin
and cause a car to crash,

15:38.913 --> 15:42.049
pull one wire
and ignite an entire building.

15:42.083 --> 15:44.117
Now you all know what I know.

15:46.588 --> 15:50.324
Just remember, Marcus' abilities
make him unpredictable

15:50.358 --> 15:52.059
and potentially
extremely dangerous,

15:52.093 --> 15:54.661
so no unnecessary risks.

15:54.695 --> 15:56.163
"Unnecessary risks."

15:56.197 --> 15:58.665
How do you know
if a risk is unnecessary?

15:58.699 --> 15:59.933
What's a necessary risk?

15:59.968 --> 16:01.268
Gary, you're
just gonna be scanning

16:01.302 --> 16:02.602
cell phones
and street cameras, okay?

16:02.637 --> 16:05.505
Yeah, but I get headaches
if I go too long.

16:05.540 --> 16:08.008
- Well, that's pretty standard.
- Is that a necessary risk?

16:08.042 --> 16:10.343
- You're gonna be okay, okay?
- Is that an unnecessary risk?

16:13.548 --> 16:17.184
Marcus has been on the loose
for almost a day,

16:17.218 --> 16:18.718
and you don't even tell me?

16:18.753 --> 16:21.355
I know
it always troubled you--

16:21.389 --> 16:24.224
the fact that I chose to send
Marcus to Binghamton.

16:24.259 --> 16:26.727
Not as much
as it bothered you.

16:26.761 --> 16:31.532
I always worried that,
you know, I would be next.

16:31.566 --> 16:33.868
You know what happened
to my boyfriend

16:33.902 --> 16:36.203
and what I made him do--
I hurt someone...

16:36.238 --> 16:38.873
and so has Hicks and Harken--
Never intentionally.

16:38.907 --> 16:41.876
Yeah, but you're the one
who gets to make that choice...

16:41.910 --> 16:43.611
Who goes and who stays.

16:43.645 --> 16:47.816
Nina, that's something
I think about every day.

16:51.187 --> 16:52.821
- Really?
- Please.

16:52.856 --> 16:54.856
Cause.

17:03.033 --> 17:04.200
Effect.

17:08.372 --> 17:12.041
Uh, from now on,
l-let's avoid sharp objects.

17:18.049 --> 17:20.017
Learning anything?

17:20.050 --> 17:22.286
Well, I can tell you
he's no lost little lamb.

17:22.319 --> 17:25.355
That man's got a mean streak.
Driven by paranoia.

17:25.390 --> 17:28.658
Since he can control so much
in his environment,

17:28.693 --> 17:30.994
he has a hard time
understanding why others can't.

17:31.029 --> 17:33.997
So, when people fail him,

17:34.032 --> 17:36.200
he assumes malevolent purpose.

17:36.234 --> 17:37.467
Yeah, I get that.

17:37.502 --> 17:40.036
Precisely why I wanted you
to take a look at this,

17:40.071 --> 17:43.307
because your neuroanatomy
is quite similar to Marcus'.

17:43.341 --> 17:46.043
You're telling me my mind
is wired like a psychopath.

17:46.078 --> 17:48.045
No, I'm not saying that.

17:48.080 --> 17:51.149
Neuroanatomy and psyche
are two very different things.

17:51.183 --> 17:52.484
Marcus blames everyone else

17:52.518 --> 17:54.286
for the things that go wrong
in his life,

17:54.320 --> 17:56.021
whereas you turn
the blame inward.

17:56.055 --> 17:59.491
You obsess on every moment
of past failure.

17:59.526 --> 18:02.661
I don't know, Doc.

18:02.695 --> 18:05.663
I mean, I look
at this guy's face, and I think,

18:05.698 --> 18:07.398
you know, he blames everything
and everyone,

18:07.433 --> 18:08.666
but somewhere inside of him,

18:08.700 --> 18:10.901
he is pointing that finger
right at himself.

18:26.550 --> 18:28.318
What are you finding, Rachel?

18:28.353 --> 18:30.854
Well, there weren't
any fingerprints,

18:30.888 --> 18:33.690
but I did find a tiny smudge
in the grooves.

18:33.725 --> 18:36.360
It's old,
but I'm pretty sure it's--

18:36.395 --> 18:37.528
Ash.

18:37.563 --> 18:40.432
Yeah.
How'd you know that?

18:40.466 --> 18:42.801
Past failures.

19:14.032 --> 19:15.333
Dr. Rosen!

19:21.707 --> 19:24.376
What took you so long?

19:28.814 --> 19:30.002
Dr. Singh says you have a team.

19:30.017 --> 19:31.751
He says they're a bunch
of misfits--I'd fit right in.

19:31.786 --> 19:33.586
Are they here, huh?
Are they gonna try to stop me?

19:33.621 --> 19:35.589
Is that why you left a trail
for me to follow?

19:35.624 --> 19:37.024
Would you like to meet them?

19:37.059 --> 19:39.293
I think you'll find
that they're not your enemies.

19:39.327 --> 19:41.762
- So you're not my enemy?
- No.

19:41.797 --> 19:44.432
Your enemy has only ever been
your thinking, Marcus.

19:44.466 --> 19:46.334
You've got to understand that.

19:46.368 --> 19:47.835
God, where have
I heard that before?

19:47.870 --> 19:51.205
Oh, that's right--from Singh
and his staff for six years.

19:51.240 --> 19:52.607
You told me I was special.

19:52.641 --> 19:54.075
Then you handed me
over to people

19:54.109 --> 19:56.610
that spent all their time
telling me I'm broken.

19:56.644 --> 19:57.945
Mmm.
God, that tastes good.

19:57.979 --> 19:59.613
You know, Singh won't let me
have any sugar.

19:59.648 --> 20:00.948
Is that why
you brought me here--

20:00.982 --> 20:02.449
to tell me
about all the horrible things

20:02.483 --> 20:05.451
that are happening to you
at Binghamton?

20:05.486 --> 20:07.787
You're saying
this is news to you...

20:07.821 --> 20:09.789
That you don't know
what's happening to me?

20:09.823 --> 20:13.326
The only thing that they've
ever tried to <i>do</i> to you up there

20:13.360 --> 20:15.795
is to help you understand
your feelings of persecution

20:15.829 --> 20:17.330
so you could live
a normal life.

20:17.364 --> 20:19.131
Maybe in the beginning.

20:19.165 --> 20:20.966
But things have changed,
you know?

20:21.001 --> 20:23.102
It's not just ping-pong
and group therapy anymore.

20:23.137 --> 20:24.704
What's changed?

20:24.738 --> 20:26.640
I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

20:26.674 --> 20:30.644
And now outright denial.

20:30.678 --> 20:33.480
What am I denying?

20:33.515 --> 20:35.316
Binghamton--

20:35.350 --> 20:37.385
big plans for the future.

20:37.419 --> 20:40.422
This is your mind
deceiving you again, Marcus.

20:40.456 --> 20:42.357
There were no big plans for--

20:42.392 --> 20:44.426
Then why was I
in that ambulance, huh?

20:44.461 --> 20:46.462
I don't know.
I...

20:46.496 --> 20:50.066
You don't really know
what's going on at Binghamton,

20:50.100 --> 20:54.002
and you don't know why
we're having this conversation.

20:56.806 --> 20:58.440
- No, I don't.
- And you don't even know

20:58.474 --> 21:00.909
when you're being used
as bait, do you?

21:05.915 --> 21:08.216
Not much use, are you?

21:11.520 --> 21:13.687
Marcus.

21:15.590 --> 21:17.858
Sorry, Dr. Rosen.

21:17.893 --> 21:20.127
Our time is up.

21:33.976 --> 21:36.310
Stay down.
Stay down.

21:36.345 --> 21:38.746
Someone call an ambulance!

21:40.783 --> 21:42.251
You should've kept me
in the loop.

21:42.285 --> 21:43.819
Maybe then one of my men
wouldn't be dead.

21:43.853 --> 21:45.487
And you are blaming me
for that?

21:45.522 --> 21:47.590
- You're damn right I am.
- Okay!

21:47.625 --> 21:50.694
All right, we are all
on the same side here.

21:50.728 --> 21:53.030
Now, we need to start
sharing information,

21:53.064 --> 21:54.598
or we're gonna have
more screwups.

21:54.632 --> 21:56.399
I'm not the one
acting like a cowboy.

21:56.434 --> 21:58.267
Nathan,
let me ask you something.

21:58.301 --> 22:00.936
Marcus was furious about
his treatment at Binghamton.

22:00.971 --> 22:02.772
He--he talked of plans,

22:02.806 --> 22:05.274
something that he thought was
going to happen to him off-site.

22:05.309 --> 22:06.676
Do you know anything
about that?

22:06.710 --> 22:08.945
All I know is Marcus Ayers

22:08.979 --> 22:11.781
is a paranoid and a killer.

22:11.815 --> 22:15.351
So, sorry if I can't see him
as a victim.

22:16.820 --> 22:18.888
Now, I got next of kin
to call

22:18.922 --> 22:21.324
and a murderer to catch.

22:24.661 --> 22:26.996
If you knew where to find
Marcus, you should've told us.

22:27.030 --> 22:28.998
I suspected.
I did not know.

22:29.032 --> 22:31.366
We shouldn't dismiss
what Marcus has been saying.

22:31.401 --> 22:34.470
His persecutory delusions
often have a basis in truth.

22:34.504 --> 22:37.272
They may even indicate
what he intends to do next.

22:37.307 --> 22:39.241
So you think
that Marcus' fears,

22:39.275 --> 22:41.710
his talk of plans,
there's some truth to it?

22:41.745 --> 22:44.880
We need to talk
to Dr. Singh.

22:46.283 --> 22:48.784
Thank you.

22:48.819 --> 22:52.088
Lee, I heard what happened.
I'm glad you're all right.

22:52.122 --> 22:53.923
Oh, I don't think Marcus
was trying to hurt me.

22:53.957 --> 22:55.524
I really don't.
You're alive.

22:55.559 --> 22:57.092
Seems to prove your point.

22:57.127 --> 22:59.729
On the other hand, he might not
feel so kindly towards me.

22:59.763 --> 23:02.265
Nothing like being thrown
into the deep end.

23:02.299 --> 23:04.433
Vijal, is there anything
going on at Binghamton

23:04.468 --> 23:06.102
I should be aware of?

23:06.136 --> 23:07.636
You haven't, by any chance,

23:07.671 --> 23:10.372
modified Marcus'
treatment plans, have you?

23:10.407 --> 23:12.108
Is that what Marcus
told you?

23:12.142 --> 23:14.677
Why was he being sent
off-site?

23:16.813 --> 23:19.548
Marcus proved unresponsive
to traditional therapies--

23:19.583 --> 23:23.953
SSRIs, SNRIs, antipsychotics.

23:23.987 --> 23:26.622
Sedatives worked for a time,
but he developed a tolerance.

23:26.657 --> 23:29.626
We even tried shock therapy.

23:29.660 --> 23:33.163
He redirected the current,
nearly killed one of my techs.

23:34.765 --> 23:37.400
We were shipping him off-site
for surgery.

23:37.434 --> 23:38.935
For surger--

23:38.969 --> 23:41.070
To see if we could correct
his problem,

23:41.105 --> 23:42.806
suppress his Alpha ability.

23:42.840 --> 23:45.575
Suppress his ability?

23:45.609 --> 23:48.245
Marcus' ability
is an integral part of him,

23:48.279 --> 23:50.580
as is the color
of a person's skin

23:50.615 --> 23:52.082
or you being left-handed.

23:52.116 --> 23:53.583
You can't extract that.

23:53.617 --> 23:56.286
But if I could've,
that agent would still be alive.

24:00.891 --> 24:04.594
If you'll excuse me,
I have another meeting--

24:04.628 --> 24:06.162
more feathers to unruffle.

24:06.196 --> 24:09.132
Excuse me, Dr. Singh.
We're not through here.

24:09.166 --> 24:12.201
Vijal, I sent Marcus to you as
a patient, not as a guinea pig.

24:12.235 --> 24:13.702
Really?

24:13.736 --> 24:15.771
You sure it wasn't because
you wanted him off your plate?

24:15.805 --> 24:17.640
Be honest with yourself, Lee.

24:17.674 --> 24:20.275
You have no idea what goes on
at Binghamton,

24:20.310 --> 24:23.145
and that's
the way you prefer it.

24:27.818 --> 24:29.451
Taxi!

24:29.486 --> 24:31.119
Yeah, yeah.

24:31.154 --> 24:33.822
I'll call you
when I get back to Binghamton.

24:52.407 --> 24:54.809
Aah!

25:37.292 --> 25:38.558
Did you see how it happened?

25:49.269 --> 25:50.436
The D.O.D.'s sending

25:50.470 --> 25:52.905
a notification team
over to Singh's family.

25:52.940 --> 25:56.276
Knock on the door...

25:57.945 --> 26:00.280
Uh, I think you should take
a look at this.

26:00.314 --> 26:02.416
Two people are dead,

26:02.451 --> 26:04.885
and this guy thinks
that this is some sort of game?

26:04.920 --> 26:07.755
I'm afraid
it's all games to Marcus.

26:07.789 --> 26:09.924
It's all moves
and countermoves.

26:09.958 --> 26:12.593
Yeah, well, I don't know
how many moves it's gonna take,

26:12.628 --> 26:15.963
but this game is only gonna
end now with Marcus Ayers dead.

26:44.559 --> 26:47.194
Domino number one.

26:47.228 --> 26:50.631
How'd you come up
with that?

26:50.665 --> 26:53.901
I just kind of worked
my way backwards,

26:53.935 --> 26:56.170
like I could see it.

26:56.204 --> 26:57.771
Similar, but not the same.

26:57.806 --> 27:00.407
There's no prints,
no trace particles.

27:00.441 --> 27:01.808
It's com--completely clean.

27:01.843 --> 27:02.910
They're no help.

27:02.944 --> 27:04.411
Everyone saw
something different,

27:04.446 --> 27:05.713
none of it useful.

27:05.747 --> 27:07.482
So all this,
and we're at a dead end.

27:07.516 --> 27:09.150
Not quite, bill.
I found this.

27:09.185 --> 27:10.652
Marcus is obsessed
with chess.

27:10.686 --> 27:12.187
Yes.

27:12.221 --> 27:14.756
I think Marcus' killing
of Dr. Singh

27:14.790 --> 27:16.291
is his latest move.

27:16.325 --> 27:19.026
Assuming Singh was the Rook,

27:19.061 --> 27:20.862
who do you think
is the Black King?

27:20.897 --> 27:25.300
Pollen--
there's lots of pollen.

27:27.203 --> 27:29.671
Stargazer lilies--that's where
the pollen came from.

27:29.705 --> 27:31.873
Okay, well, he could've picked
that up anywhere, right?

27:31.907 --> 27:34.542
Hotels, restaurants,
flower shops.

27:34.577 --> 27:36.044
Gary!

27:36.078 --> 27:37.879
I need you to do a search.

27:37.914 --> 27:40.716
I can't search any better
than anyone else, Bill.

27:40.750 --> 27:41.884
I'm not Google guy.

27:41.918 --> 27:43.853
I know, but you are
camera guy, right?

27:43.887 --> 27:44.854
- Yeah.
- Right.

27:44.888 --> 27:46.389
So I need you
to search cameras,

27:46.423 --> 27:47.991
security cameras
all over Manhattan.

27:48.025 --> 27:50.393
Yeah, I can do that,
but which cameras, Bill?

27:50.427 --> 27:51.594
What am I looking for?

27:51.629 --> 27:52.729
Specificity.

27:52.763 --> 27:54.731
You're looking
for stargazer lilies.

27:54.765 --> 27:56.666
- Stargazer lilies.
- It's a flower.

27:56.700 --> 27:57.667
You got it?

27:57.701 --> 27:59.401
- Stargazer lilies.
- Yes, yes.

27:59.436 --> 28:01.537
Thank you.

28:08.944 --> 28:12.814
Why don't you tell me
what happened in that apartment?

28:14.450 --> 28:18.253
Gas mains blow up
all the time.

28:18.287 --> 28:20.021
It was an accident.

28:21.290 --> 28:24.927
You don't believe
in accidents, Marcus.

28:24.961 --> 28:27.263
Ugh.
I know you're mad at me,

28:27.297 --> 28:29.366
but did you have to take it out
on the coffee?

28:29.400 --> 28:30.868
We're not here to talk
about coffee.

28:30.902 --> 28:34.871
I don't understand
why you're so upset, okay?

28:34.906 --> 28:37.207
You're my doctor.

28:37.242 --> 28:39.877
You're supposed
to take my side.

28:39.911 --> 28:42.046
Two of your roommates
are in the hospital

28:42.080 --> 28:44.048
with second-
and third-degree burns.

28:44.082 --> 28:48.219
Look, I'm sorry
the building burned down, okay?

28:48.253 --> 28:52.423
It was a nice place,
and it was rent-controlled.

28:52.457 --> 28:56.894
It's not like
anyone died, okay?

28:56.929 --> 28:59.731
No one was going to die...

28:59.765 --> 29:03.301
Unless I wanted them to.

29:10.944 --> 29:12.111
Marcus...

29:12.146 --> 29:13.579
I can't follow...

29:13.614 --> 29:16.015
- Marcus...
- The cause.

29:16.049 --> 29:18.984
I think you need more help
than I'm able to give you.

29:21.621 --> 29:23.121
What did you do?

29:25.124 --> 29:27.091
I'm going to send you
to a place

29:27.126 --> 29:29.093
where you can get
the care you need.

29:29.127 --> 29:32.096
Now, Marcus,
this is Nathan Cley, okay?

29:32.130 --> 29:34.231
He's the gentleman
who's going to bring you there.

29:39.472 --> 29:41.540
That's mistake number one.

29:41.574 --> 29:44.343
- What?
- You cannot get sentimental.

29:44.378 --> 29:45.645
That man is a killer.

29:45.679 --> 29:49.615
He was a patient first, Bill,
my patient.

29:49.650 --> 29:51.952
I keep wondering what
I could've done differently.

29:51.986 --> 29:54.387
If I had known then
what I know now, I...

29:54.422 --> 29:55.955
You know, I might've been able
to prevent all this.

29:55.990 --> 29:57.290
Doc, Doc, don't go there.

29:57.324 --> 29:58.958
You know how many times
I hear that,

29:58.993 --> 30:00.460
how many times
I hear mothers say,

30:00.494 --> 30:02.528
"I can't believe my son
did this terrible thing,"

30:02.562 --> 30:04.463
or, "I was his teacher--
I should've known better"?

30:04.497 --> 30:06.131
Let me tell you,
what you're doing

30:06.166 --> 30:08.133
is exactly what
every good person does

30:08.168 --> 30:10.636
when somebody that they know
that they're close to

30:10.670 --> 30:12.071
does something bad.

30:12.105 --> 30:15.808
Now, the fact of the matter is
Marcus was probably born broken.

30:15.842 --> 30:18.677
Nobody is born broken, Bill.

30:18.712 --> 30:20.646
Life just conspires.

30:20.681 --> 30:22.315
I encouraged him.

30:22.349 --> 30:24.583
I actually helped him perfect
his ability.

30:24.618 --> 30:28.487
I might as well have put
the gun in his hand.

30:28.522 --> 30:31.090
And now
we're gonna stop him.

30:31.124 --> 30:33.159
Search parameters.

30:33.193 --> 30:35.928
Bill, Bill,
you have to be more specific--

30:35.962 --> 30:38.064
not all
the stargazer lilies,

30:38.098 --> 30:40.433
not all of Manhattan,
just the important parts.

30:40.468 --> 30:41.768
- Okay, okay.
- Stargazer lil--

30:41.803 --> 30:43.337
All right,
what are the important parts?

30:43.371 --> 30:45.772
The parts involved in the case.

30:45.807 --> 30:48.442
Stargazer lily locations
are set "A."

30:48.476 --> 30:51.111
Places and people involved
in the case are set "B."

30:51.145 --> 30:52.612
We're looking
for the intersection...

30:52.647 --> 30:53.780
- So, Gary--
- The overlap.

30:53.815 --> 30:55.782
Okay, so did you find
anything?

30:55.816 --> 30:58.118
Yeah, Bill,
it's what I do.

30:58.152 --> 31:00.887
Office tower
near the federal building.

31:00.922 --> 31:02.623
Dr. Rosen, I--

31:02.657 --> 31:04.958
Here.

31:04.992 --> 31:07.294
Stargazer lilies
in the lobby,

31:07.328 --> 31:08.629
Cley and his team

31:08.663 --> 31:11.632
working out of a temporary
location upstairs.

31:11.666 --> 31:13.967
Yeah, a chess piece

31:14.002 --> 31:16.804
sitting next to a whole table
full of flowers.

31:16.838 --> 31:19.139
Smell nice, if you like
that kind of thing.

31:19.174 --> 31:23.143
Marcus was right there,
and I'm guessing he still is.

31:23.177 --> 31:26.145
So you're saying
I'm the Black King.

31:26.180 --> 31:27.313
I like that.

31:27.347 --> 31:30.249
He's coming after me,
let him come.

31:30.284 --> 31:32.885
This isn't a game, Nathan,
chess or otherwise.

31:32.919 --> 31:34.920
I know that...

31:34.954 --> 31:37.289
better than you.

31:38.959 --> 31:42.094
From now on, call me
"Your highness."

31:42.129 --> 31:43.362
Let's wrap this up.

32:02.652 --> 32:05.320
I'm waiting!

32:12.737 --> 32:14.538
Cley--
unbelievable.

32:14.572 --> 32:16.373
The guy's got a pair
of brass ones.

32:16.407 --> 32:18.341
I'll give it to him.
He chose his ground well--

32:18.375 --> 32:20.009
open space, no moving objects.

32:20.044 --> 32:22.378
There's not a lot
for Marcus to work with.

32:22.412 --> 32:25.114
The area's been cleared,

32:25.148 --> 32:27.417
but Cley's got snipers
on the roof.

32:27.451 --> 32:29.652
This isn't going to work.

32:29.687 --> 32:32.155
Cley's ambush--

32:32.189 --> 32:34.357
Marcus would've seen this
coming a mile away.

32:34.392 --> 32:37.226
It's too logical a countermove
on our part.

32:37.261 --> 32:39.162
You sure about that, Doc?

32:39.196 --> 32:41.531
You ask me, Cley makes a pretty
tempting target out there.

32:41.565 --> 32:43.833
He's not gonna just walk
into a trap.

32:43.867 --> 32:46.569
It's up to us to find out
what his next move's gonna be.

32:46.603 --> 32:47.837
Rachel,
you're gonna come with me.

32:47.871 --> 32:49.138
Nina, you're gonna stay
with Hicks.

32:49.173 --> 32:51.874
Fan out, move very slowly
and carefully.

32:51.909 --> 32:54.010
If you see or hear anything,
call us.

32:54.044 --> 32:55.678
Let's go.
I need your eyes.

32:55.712 --> 32:56.979
Lee.

32:57.014 --> 32:58.548
So this is how we deal
with Alphas?

32:58.582 --> 32:59.682
Nina.

32:59.716 --> 33:01.216
When things go wrong,
we assassinate them?

33:01.250 --> 33:03.185
Marcus brought this
upon himself.

33:03.219 --> 33:05.855
He did kill someone.
Snipers on the roof?

33:05.889 --> 33:08.624
That's not
what I signed up for.

33:11.227 --> 33:13.362
Trouble?

33:13.396 --> 33:15.564
Understandable concerns.

33:15.598 --> 33:18.166
Come on, guys.

33:27.642 --> 33:31.144
- What are they trying to do?
- Boxing him in.

33:31.178 --> 33:32.812
Oh, maybe Rosen's right.

33:32.846 --> 33:35.615
Maybe he's playing us.

33:36.984 --> 33:39.151
Hey!

33:39.185 --> 33:43.522
Hey! Stop! Freeze!

33:43.557 --> 33:44.657
Okay.

33:44.691 --> 33:46.191
Come on, Rachel,
what do you hear?

33:46.226 --> 33:49.495
I'm scanning.
Let me concentrate.

33:49.529 --> 33:51.831
Okay.

33:51.865 --> 33:53.332
I smell something.

33:57.137 --> 34:00.306
Gas--
there's gas in the sewer.

34:09.984 --> 34:11.650
Aah!

34:11.686 --> 34:12.851
Aah!

34:21.228 --> 34:23.964
Are you okay?

34:23.998 --> 34:26.500
Yeah.

34:35.612 --> 34:37.413
Checkmate.

34:45.188 --> 34:46.855
Son of a bitch.

34:49.692 --> 34:51.359
Marcus,
why are you doing this?

34:51.393 --> 34:54.829
If I'm your target,
you could've taken me anytime.

34:54.864 --> 34:57.065
I have something
to show you.

34:57.099 --> 34:59.767
Drive.

35:03.439 --> 35:06.007
Gary.
Yes, Gary, I know it's late.

35:06.042 --> 35:09.344
Listen, I need you to track
a black SUV, government plates.

35:09.378 --> 35:11.412
They just left the federal
building a few minutes ago.

35:14.550 --> 35:16.017
Okay, I can see them.

35:16.051 --> 35:19.620
Yeah, they're--they're headed
north on Henry Hudson,

35:19.654 --> 35:21.121
and he's going very fast.

35:21.156 --> 35:22.790
It's illegal to go that fast.

35:22.824 --> 35:25.359
Yeah, well, if you think
that's illegal, you watch this.

35:27.496 --> 35:30.565
Stay on them--
close, but not too close.

35:37.072 --> 35:38.640
Get after them.

35:43.846 --> 35:46.214
Marcus,
wait a minute.

35:46.249 --> 35:47.649
Don't do this.

35:47.684 --> 35:49.651
Marcus, please, don't do this.

35:49.685 --> 35:51.319
No!

35:54.857 --> 35:57.158
We're 50 meters up.

35:57.192 --> 36:00.161
It takes a little over
three seconds to fall that far.

36:00.195 --> 36:01.662
That means a body
would hit bottom

36:01.696 --> 36:03.830
going something,
like, 70 miles an hour.

36:03.864 --> 36:05.498
If you're trying
to scare me, Marcus,

36:05.532 --> 36:08.134
you're doing
an excellent job of it.

36:10.203 --> 36:14.006
You have every reason
to be afraid.

36:14.040 --> 36:16.008
We all do...

36:16.042 --> 36:17.743
No matter what side you're on.

36:17.777 --> 36:21.113
There are
no sides here, Marcus.

36:21.148 --> 36:23.616
But you have broken the law.

36:23.651 --> 36:25.952
You have hurt people.

36:25.986 --> 36:27.620
What--what have you
always said?

36:27.654 --> 36:29.122
Cause and effect.

36:29.156 --> 36:31.958
And now this is where we find
ourselves because of that.

36:31.992 --> 36:33.360
It's not that simple.

36:33.394 --> 36:36.129
What they plan to do to me...

36:36.164 --> 36:38.799
What they plan to do for all
the Alphas at Binghamton--

36:38.833 --> 36:40.802
that's got nothing to do
with the law

36:40.836 --> 36:42.804
or medicine...

36:42.839 --> 36:44.606
or common decency.

36:44.641 --> 36:46.609
That does not justify murder.

36:46.643 --> 36:49.145
It's not murder.

36:49.180 --> 36:51.315
Singh was a casualty of war.

36:51.349 --> 36:53.684
War?

36:53.718 --> 36:55.820
I see what's coming...

36:55.854 --> 36:57.154
20 moves ahead.

36:57.189 --> 36:59.323
I thought
that you could, too,

36:59.358 --> 37:01.325
that--that you had to be
a part of it,

37:01.360 --> 37:03.127
but now I realize
you didn't see it coming.

37:03.161 --> 37:05.329
You don't...

37:05.364 --> 37:06.664
You don't see anything.

37:06.698 --> 37:08.666
I'm trying, Marcus.

37:08.700 --> 37:10.335
Believe me, I'm trying.

37:14.172 --> 37:17.508
All units, looks like they're
heading into Inwood Hill Park.

37:17.542 --> 37:20.478
It's
an out-of-context problem.

37:20.512 --> 37:22.380
- What?
- Out-of-context problem--

37:22.415 --> 37:25.116
that's what the Alphas are.

37:25.151 --> 37:28.787
No one saw us coming,
so the response is instinctual--

37:28.821 --> 37:31.723
panicked, violent.

37:31.758 --> 37:34.426
Yes, but it doesn't always
have to end in violence.

37:34.460 --> 37:37.396
The Alpha phenomenon--
it's an opportunity

37:37.430 --> 37:39.498
for us, for all us, for you.

37:39.532 --> 37:40.732
It's your gift.

37:40.767 --> 37:42.801
- My gift?
- Yes.

37:42.836 --> 37:46.639
My gift got me locked up
for six years.

37:46.673 --> 37:50.242
Terrified Singh so much, he was
willing to cut my head open

37:50.277 --> 37:51.677
to pull it out.

37:51.711 --> 37:55.314
He wanted to turn me
into nothing!

37:55.348 --> 37:58.516
He wanted to turn all of us
into nothing!

37:58.551 --> 38:02.253
He was afraid of us.

38:04.857 --> 38:06.690
And maybe he was right.

38:06.725 --> 38:09.626
Marcus, you are a much better
person than what you are doing.

38:09.661 --> 38:12.496
I miss that...

38:12.530 --> 38:16.166
And your belief that somehow
trajectories can be altered,

38:16.200 --> 38:18.934
even once the dominoes
have started to fall.

38:18.969 --> 38:20.436
They can.
They can.

38:20.470 --> 38:22.238
You can always change.
No.

38:22.273 --> 38:24.107
You're wrong.

38:24.141 --> 38:27.444
It's too late for me.
My path is locked in.

38:27.478 --> 38:28.612
No. No.

38:28.646 --> 38:30.280
The sides
are only gonna get more rigid,

38:30.314 --> 38:32.282
more predictable,
but you--

38:32.316 --> 38:35.618
you're the variable,
the part I could never see.

38:35.653 --> 38:37.620
You still have one move
left to make--

38:37.655 --> 38:39.790
the only thing
that might get you

38:39.824 --> 38:42.960
to this rosy future
you cling to.

38:42.995 --> 38:45.430
And w-what move is that?

38:47.333 --> 38:49.167
Kick over the chessboard.

38:53.540 --> 38:55.642
Good job, Gary.
We found them.

38:55.676 --> 38:57.477
Right on time.

38:57.511 --> 38:59.312
- No, Marcus--
- They need to see this.

38:59.347 --> 39:01.114
Ayers!

39:01.148 --> 39:03.416
Bill! No!
It's not necessary!

39:03.451 --> 39:05.485
Please, put your gun down.

39:05.519 --> 39:08.321
This is all playing out
the way it's supposed to--

39:08.355 --> 39:11.991
you and me standing here.

39:12.026 --> 39:14.061
This is
the best possible outcome.

39:17.232 --> 39:19.667
If I'm wrong...

39:19.701 --> 39:22.136
They'll take me alive.

39:23.705 --> 39:25.372
Nathan, no!

39:43.106 --> 39:44.842
Still no sign of the body.

39:46.283 --> 39:48.021
In his debriefing,

39:48.022 --> 39:50.172
Cley swore he hit Marcus
square in the chest.

39:51.833 --> 39:54.668
So I guess chances are his body
got taken up with the current,

39:54.703 --> 39:57.338
which means it may take weeks
to find it.

39:57.372 --> 39:59.506
Or we may never find it
at all, right?

39:59.541 --> 40:02.343
And then there's that.

40:02.377 --> 40:04.011
Agent Sullivan,
have you ever heard

40:04.045 --> 40:06.513
of the phrase
"Out-of-context problem"?

40:06.547 --> 40:09.550
Like the Spanish
and the Aztecs.

40:09.584 --> 40:11.618
The Aztecs were able to handle
anything their world

40:11.653 --> 40:13.621
threw at them
until the Spanish showed up.

40:13.655 --> 40:16.624
Yes, and--
and destroyed them.

40:16.658 --> 40:19.461
Um, see, Marcus said that,

40:19.495 --> 40:22.665
that Alphas might be
our out-of-context problem.

40:22.699 --> 40:24.033
Do you agree?

40:24.067 --> 40:26.135
I think
it would be a mistake

40:26.170 --> 40:28.137
to get into that kind
of thinking--

40:28.172 --> 40:30.306
us versus them.

40:30.341 --> 40:33.342
It should be us <i>and</i> them.
That's the only option.

40:33.377 --> 40:36.078
Let's hope you're right.

40:46.688 --> 40:49.823
It's been 18 hours.
You want to call it?

40:49.858 --> 40:52.826
Nope.
Keep looking.

40:52.861 --> 40:53.927
Yes, sir.
