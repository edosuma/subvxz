01:25.878 --> 01:27.671
Yesterday

01:27.754 --> 01:33.385
A child came out to wonder

01:34.720 --> 01:37.598
Caught a dragonfly

01:37.681 --> 01:42.811
Inside a jar

01:43.729 --> 01:45.147
Fearful

01:45.230 --> 01:51.486
When the sky was full of thunder

01:51.904 --> 01:53.447
And tearful

01:53.530 --> 02:00.495
At the falling of a star

02:01.371 --> 02:04.374
Then the child moved ten times

02:04.458 --> 02:09.670
Round the seasons

02:10.172 --> 02:16.887
Skated over ten clear frozen streams

02:17.638 --> 02:21.475
Words like "When you're older"

02:21.558 --> 02:25.896
Must appease him

02:25.979 --> 02:29.525
And promises of someday

02:29.608 --> 02:34.196
Make his dreams

02:34.738 --> 02:39.034
And the seasons they go round and round

02:39.117 --> 02:44.039
And the painted ponies go up and down

02:44.706 --> 02:51.213
We're captive on the carousel of time

02:51.964 --> 02:55.342
We can't return
We can only look

02:55.676 --> 02:59.346
Behind from where we came

02:59.429 --> 03:03.308
And go round and round and round

03:03.392 --> 03:08.564
In the circle game

03:08.897 --> 03:10.816
And the seasons

03:10.899 --> 03:13.318
They go round and round

03:13.402 --> 03:18.365
And the painted ponies go up and down

03:19.032 --> 03:26.039
We're captive on the carousel of time

03:27.291 --> 03:30.627
We can't return
We can only look

03:31.378 --> 03:34.840
Behind from where we came

03:34.923 --> 03:38.844
And go round and round and round

03:38.927 --> 03:45.934
In the circle game

03:52.816 --> 03:56.028
Thank you to our eighth grade chorus
for a wonderful performance.

04:04.369 --> 04:09.082
We are, all of us, trying to process the
mixed emotions we're feeling right now.

04:09.499 --> 04:13.045
Ben's mother, Joan, is here
and asked to say a few words.

04:35.526 --> 04:39.404
This is, of course,
an incredibly hard day for us,

04:40.280 --> 04:41.782
but I think Ben...

04:47.746 --> 04:49.957
But I think Ben would have wanted me here.

04:51.667 --> 04:53.544
To let his classmates know...

04:54.795 --> 04:56.964
how proud of them he would have been.

04:59.174 --> 05:03.512
We wanna thank the school,
and the PTA especially,

05:03.971 --> 05:07.975
for the endowment
that's been established in Ben's name.

05:09.059 --> 05:11.186
It means a lot to our family.

05:14.273 --> 05:15.691
To Ben's friends...

05:16.942 --> 05:19.820
we wanna wish you every success

05:19.903 --> 05:22.656
as you continue on to high school
in the fall.

05:24.283 --> 05:25.868
And to your parents...

05:31.498 --> 05:33.125
appreciate them.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.588
I know you do, but please.

05:38.922 --> 05:40.591
We forget sometimes.

05:48.515 --> 05:49.641
Thank you.

05:55.606 --> 05:56.732
Thank you, Joan.

05:58.150 --> 06:04.489
I know I speak for all of us when I say
Ben is in our hearts today and every day.

07:40.294 --> 07:41.712
Are you gonna say something?

07:42.838 --> 07:45.465
You're sitting there
like somebody's got a gun to your head.

07:47.176 --> 07:49.469
You wanted me to come. I'm here.

07:50.512 --> 07:52.139
So, that's how it is, huh?

07:52.222 --> 07:53.599
What'd you expect?

07:53.682 --> 07:54.892
I don't know.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.438
I mean, it's been a whole life, almost.

08:00.314 --> 08:02.482
And not once did you ever come visit.

08:03.692 --> 08:07.738
What kind of a son turns his back
on his own father like that, huh?

08:07.821 --> 08:09.281
What kind of a man?

08:10.866 --> 08:12.993
I know I'm a fucking bad guy
and all, but...

08:14.286 --> 08:15.579
I'm still your father.

08:20.584 --> 08:22.336
You came out big anyway.

08:22.419 --> 08:24.087
She must have fed you good.

08:24.421 --> 08:26.882
She did fine. With everything.

08:28.050 --> 08:29.551
I heard the cancer got her.

08:29.635 --> 08:30.719
What do you care?

08:31.595 --> 08:33.639
-I don't.
-Then don't talk about her.

08:33.722 --> 08:35.474
I knew her before you did.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.609
Did Dr. Vogel explain
what we need from you?

08:49.821 --> 08:53.951
Yeah, she said it had something to do
with my grandson.

08:55.285 --> 08:58.622
Told her I didn't know I had a grandson
till I saw him on the news.

08:58.705 --> 08:59.748
Well, you do.

09:00.916 --> 09:01.917
He's a good kid.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.253
Can't be that good
or you wouldn't be here.

09:04.920 --> 09:06.880
What is he, 13, 14?

09:07.381 --> 09:08.715
He's 14.

09:10.050 --> 09:13.387
Fourteen and they already
got him on a fucking murder. Jesus.

09:14.930 --> 09:15.973
Who'd he kill?

09:16.056 --> 09:18.851
-No one. He's innocent.
-Yeah, me too.

09:18.934 --> 09:20.352
Must run in the family.

09:23.689 --> 09:25.482
Fuck you. Calm down, relax.

09:25.566 --> 09:28.819
You say he's innocent, fine.
He's innocent.

09:30.153 --> 09:31.154
So...

09:32.614 --> 09:34.241
I help you out here...

09:35.409 --> 09:37.327
you can pull a couple strings,

09:37.411 --> 09:39.705
give me a shot at some daylight
before I croak?

09:40.122 --> 09:41.707
Absolutely not.

09:48.380 --> 09:49.381
So...

09:51.049 --> 09:54.219
I'm helping you why?

09:55.679 --> 09:59.308
Because he's your grandson
and he's in trouble.

10:01.602 --> 10:03.896
What's my grandson's name again?

10:06.148 --> 10:07.149
Jacob.

10:09.234 --> 10:10.819
We named him after Laurie's father.

10:11.236 --> 10:12.613
My wife's father.

10:14.615 --> 10:17.034
She didn't wanna meet me, huh?
Your wife?

10:17.117 --> 10:18.827
I wouldn't let her even if she did.

10:18.911 --> 10:22.664
See, there you go again with the fucking
attitude when you should be apologizing.

10:22.748 --> 10:24.249
For what?

10:24.333 --> 10:25.959
For abandoning me.

10:27.336 --> 10:29.254
For leaving me to fucking rot in here.

10:29.338 --> 10:31.340
You're a goddamn lawyer,
for Christ's sake.

10:32.424 --> 10:35.969
What the fuck is so funny? Huh?
You cocky little prick.

10:36.053 --> 10:38.055
Walk in here with your fucking attitude.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.182
You wouldn't be talking so tough

10:40.265 --> 10:42.643
if they didn't have
this bulletproof glass between us.

10:44.728 --> 10:46.438
So you gonna apologize or what?

10:49.650 --> 10:51.568
I didn't come here to apologize.

10:52.236 --> 10:54.488
I came here to get you to spit on a Q-tip.

10:54.571 --> 10:56.031
Are you gonna do it or not?

10:56.823 --> 10:58.033
What do you need it for?

10:58.450 --> 10:59.493
I just need it.

11:04.081 --> 11:05.499
Ask nice then.

11:09.086 --> 11:10.546
Look, the guard already has the swab kit.

11:10.629 --> 11:13.507
-All you gotta do is--
-Tell the guard to shove it up his ass.

11:14.216 --> 11:15.425
Or yours.

11:15.926 --> 11:17.678
-Okay, listen--
-Yeah, too late.

11:19.221 --> 11:20.389
Will you wait a minute?

11:20.472 --> 11:21.849
Will you pick up the phone?

11:22.766 --> 11:23.851
Hey!

11:30.858 --> 11:32.693
You gave it your best shot.

11:32.776 --> 11:34.486
He fucking played me.

11:34.570 --> 11:36.655
He was never gonna take that test.

11:36.738 --> 11:41.660
Just wanted to find a way to get
some power over me, and I gave it to him.

11:41.743 --> 11:44.413
It sounds like he was trying
to ensure another visit.

11:45.080 --> 11:47.541
It might be worth it.
The guy's been locked up since the '80s.

11:47.624 --> 11:49.501
A little kindness
from his only son might--

11:49.585 --> 11:52.462
No. He's just gonna string me along,
trust me.

11:53.547 --> 11:54.715
I know his type.

11:56.425 --> 11:57.676
I'm not going back.

11:58.552 --> 11:59.887
Then we'll do it the hard way.

11:59.970 --> 12:02.055
-I'll get a court order.
-Yeah, but then what?

12:02.139 --> 12:04.183
Logiudice will hear about it.
He'll pursue the same evidence.

12:04.266 --> 12:06.393
He'll find a way
to use it against us in court.

12:06.476 --> 12:07.978
It's exactly what I would do.

12:08.812 --> 12:10.439
I don't see another way.

12:10.522 --> 12:14.359
There isn't. Let's just let this go.

12:16.695 --> 12:18.614
Let's give it a little more time, huh?

12:19.448 --> 12:21.325
Maybe the old man will come around.

12:25.704 --> 12:26.788
Listen.

12:27.289 --> 12:28.624
There's one more thing.

12:29.791 --> 12:32.920
I thought we agreed. No interviews.

12:33.337 --> 12:34.338
What?

12:35.756 --> 12:37.966
I guess Laurie didn't get the memo.

12:39.676 --> 12:42.387
Look, I said I'm sorry.
I explained to you how it happened.

12:42.471 --> 12:43.472
It was just careless.

12:43.555 --> 12:45.849
I was emotional,
and I didn't mean what I said.

12:46.225 --> 12:47.226
The part about you.

12:47.309 --> 12:49.102
That I've never had a real friend,
that part?

12:50.854 --> 12:52.564
I'm just glad
they didn't ask you about Jacob.

12:52.648 --> 12:53.899
What's that supposed to mean?

12:57.903 --> 12:58.904
It's for me.

13:06.161 --> 13:07.287
-Hey.
-Hi.

13:07.996 --> 13:10.541
-Nice shirt.
-Shut up. Here.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.043
Nice. I'll get some spoons.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.379
I brought mint chocolate chip
and cookie dough.

13:15.796 --> 13:17.881
Hi. I'm Sarah.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.801
I'm Laurie. It's nice to meet you, Sarah.

13:20.884 --> 13:22.511
We've heard a lot about you.

13:22.594 --> 13:24.054
Looks like you got a summer job.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.973
Yeah. It's my first week.

13:26.557 --> 13:28.141
My scooping arm's really sore.

13:29.601 --> 13:32.563
Sarah's mom said she can hang out
for a couple hours, if that's okay?

13:32.646 --> 13:34.314
Of course. Absolutely.

13:34.773 --> 13:35.899
She's never seen Borat.

13:35.983 --> 13:38.151
Well, Jake can practically recite
the whole thing.

13:40.571 --> 13:41.572
See ya.

13:45.742 --> 13:46.952
She's adorable.

13:47.035 --> 13:48.412
Yeah, she's a good kid.

13:53.250 --> 13:55.169
I'm sorry I gave you a hard time
about the article.

13:55.252 --> 13:57.212
No, it's fine. You had a right to.

13:57.296 --> 13:58.297
No, I didn't.

14:03.177 --> 14:04.469
Were you angry?

14:04.553 --> 14:05.554
Angry?

14:05.637 --> 14:07.973
About the comments your wife made
in the Globe.

14:08.056 --> 14:10.058
Those weren't comments.
She was blindsided.

14:10.142 --> 14:12.060
She described your family as isolates.

14:12.603 --> 14:14.688
-The neighborhood pariahs.
-Which we were.

14:14.771 --> 14:18.483
But it came across as a rather
tone-deaf bid for sympathy, didn't it?

14:18.567 --> 14:21.445
And she never once mentioned
the Rifkins' own suffering.

14:21.528 --> 14:24.489
-We were under a lot of stress.
-This was how long before the trial?

14:24.573 --> 14:25.574
Eight or nine weeks?

14:25.657 --> 14:26.992
Something like that.

14:27.075 --> 14:29.578
And you still believed,
with absolute certainty,

14:29.661 --> 14:31.830
that your son
was innocent of any crime?

14:31.914 --> 14:33.665
-Of course.
-Never had a doubt?

14:34.124 --> 14:35.250
Not even for a minute?

14:35.709 --> 14:36.710
Never.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.128
What about Laurie?

14:42.633 --> 14:43.842
She felt the same.

16:57.309 --> 16:58.310
Joan.

17:42.938 --> 17:45.232
All right. Let's go, kid.
Come on now. Keep 'em up. Up.

17:45.941 --> 17:47.568
There you go. That's it.

18:06.336 --> 18:07.713
I'm not trying to put you in a tough spot,

18:07.796 --> 18:09.256
but you gotta understand
where I'm coming from.

18:09.339 --> 18:10.841
I just wanna know
if you questioned him again.

18:10.924 --> 18:12.843
Fine. Yes, I talked to him again
at the school.

18:12.926 --> 18:15.345
If Derek Yoo's a suspect,
I have a right to know.

18:16.805 --> 18:17.931
Is he a suspect?

18:19.641 --> 18:20.934
Duff, please.

18:22.603 --> 18:23.604
Fuck!

18:24.146 --> 18:26.440
Look, I got a tip,
I thought it might've been something.

18:26.523 --> 18:27.816
That's all I can say.

18:27.900 --> 18:30.777
I already briefed Logiudice. He determined
there was nothing exculpatory.

18:30.861 --> 18:33.405
-That doesn't mean there's nothing there.
-The kid has an alibi, Andy.

18:33.488 --> 18:34.990
His mother drove him to school
the morning of.

18:35.073 --> 18:37.618
His mother? His mother. That's his alibi?

18:38.452 --> 18:41.205
If you already cleared the kid, what's the
harm in telling why you questioned him?

18:41.288 --> 18:44.499
-Okay, I'm late for a meeting.
-Wait. Was there motive, is that it?

18:44.583 --> 18:45.584
Let go of my door.

18:46.126 --> 18:47.669
Will you at least tell me
who tipped you off?

18:47.753 --> 18:49.129
Let go of my door.

18:53.258 --> 18:54.259
Was it a kid?

18:55.177 --> 18:56.178
A boy? A girl?

18:57.429 --> 18:58.430
Duff, please!

21:07.476 --> 21:10.938
Laurie. Did I misread my calendar?
Am I seeing Jacob today?

21:11.021 --> 21:14.358
No, he's home. With his tutor.

21:15.025 --> 21:16.485
He can't really do anything this summer,

21:16.568 --> 21:19.238
so we figured he may as well
get a jump on ninth grade.

21:20.239 --> 21:21.240
Okay.

21:22.449 --> 21:25.160
Is there something I can do for you?

21:26.954 --> 21:27.955
I...

21:29.039 --> 21:30.207
Laurie?

21:30.290 --> 21:33.961
Look, I'm sorry. I know you're really
busy. I shouldn't have come here.

21:34.753 --> 21:35.754
I'm sorry.

21:37.965 --> 21:38.966
I'm sorry.

21:40.717 --> 21:42.511
I don't know what I'm doing...

21:47.015 --> 21:48.559
-It's okay.
-I'm sorry.

21:48.642 --> 21:49.893
Let's talk in my office.

22:01.905 --> 22:02.739
-Bye.
-See you.

22:02.823 --> 22:04.199
-Good to see you.
-Bye.

22:16.420 --> 22:17.671
My mom's here.

22:17.754 --> 22:19.256
-See you later.
-Later.

22:35.564 --> 22:36.565
Hey, Derek.

22:38.317 --> 22:39.318
Lacrosse game?

22:39.943 --> 22:40.944
Clinic.

22:41.528 --> 22:42.571
Cool.

22:43.447 --> 22:46.325
I was just picking up
Jacob's graduation certificate.

22:48.410 --> 22:50.704
-You need a ride or--
-No. My mom's coming.

22:50.787 --> 22:53.373
She's just late. She had car trouble.

22:56.084 --> 22:59.296
Well, say hi to your parents
for me, will ya?

23:01.006 --> 23:02.007
Sure. Yeah.

23:02.633 --> 23:04.384
Oh, hey, how did it go, by the way?

23:04.968 --> 23:06.720
The interview with Detective Duffy?

23:07.804 --> 23:09.431
You know, she and I used to work together.

23:12.017 --> 23:13.018
I...

23:13.477 --> 23:15.395
I don't think I'm supposed to talk to you
about this stuff.

23:15.479 --> 23:16.480
What stuff?

23:17.189 --> 23:18.941
Oh, you mean Ben Rifkin stuff?

23:19.024 --> 23:20.234
Sure, sure.

23:21.151 --> 23:22.402
Yeah, you're probably right.

23:25.113 --> 23:27.950
What about Jacob? Can we talk about him?

23:28.033 --> 23:29.284
I don't know. I don't think so--

23:29.368 --> 23:32.871
'Cause it never made sense to me
why you were so quick to say he did it.

23:34.831 --> 23:36.375
I only said he had a knife.

23:37.125 --> 23:39.837
Well, you wrote,
"Everyone knows you did it."

23:46.385 --> 23:47.845
You know, our lawyer has a theory

23:47.928 --> 23:50.931
that it was an attempt to try
and draw attention away from yourself.

23:51.849 --> 23:53.058
What? No.

23:53.141 --> 23:55.727
That would align
with what Detective Duffy was saying.

23:55.811 --> 23:57.896
She said she heard something about you...

23:58.605 --> 24:00.566
and that something
made her look at you differently.

24:00.649 --> 24:02.067
That's 'cause Sarah told--

24:03.193 --> 24:04.278
What was that?

24:05.487 --> 24:06.947
I said I didn't do it.

24:07.489 --> 24:08.323
No?

24:10.450 --> 24:12.369
I know you think you know Jacob.

24:13.495 --> 24:14.788
But you don't.

24:15.706 --> 24:18.083
Jake's got this dark side.

24:19.293 --> 24:20.502
He goes on these sites.

24:20.586 --> 24:23.297
He calls it "cutter," like, cutter porn.

24:24.131 --> 24:27.384
There's this one he's really into.
The Cut Up Room.

24:29.553 --> 24:30.762
All kids watch porn, Derek.

24:30.846 --> 24:32.472
No, this isn't just porn.

24:34.224 --> 24:35.225
It's creepier.

24:35.934 --> 24:38.896
It's all about, like,
tying people up and stuff.

24:51.241 --> 24:53.994
I don't even know why I came down here.
I'm so embarrassed.

24:54.077 --> 24:55.996
Oh, please don't be embarrassed.

24:56.872 --> 24:59.333
Maybe there was something
you wanted to discuss with me?

24:59.416 --> 25:01.001
No, there's nothing.

25:02.044 --> 25:03.045
You sure?

25:03.629 --> 25:04.796
Yeah. I...

25:06.715 --> 25:07.716
It's okay.

25:10.219 --> 25:14.056
What you said the other day
about everything being confidential...

25:14.139 --> 25:16.058
Absolutely.
We're on the same team here.

25:17.351 --> 25:18.685
Well, there was this...

25:20.145 --> 25:21.897
I remembered this other thing.

25:23.690 --> 25:25.025
Maybe I should just tell you.

25:26.401 --> 25:29.530
It happened so long ago.
Jacob was only five.

25:30.155 --> 25:32.616
We were at his friend Dylan's
bowling party.

25:33.367 --> 25:37.079
And Jake got paired up with another boy.
I think his name was Grant.

25:38.539 --> 25:40.707
I don't know why,
but Jake and this other boy,

25:40.791 --> 25:43.168
they kept fighting over whose turn it was,

25:43.252 --> 25:44.670
who got to use which ball.

25:46.797 --> 25:50.759
Anyway, I was busy talking to another mom
when I happened to look over

25:50.843 --> 25:54.429
and see Jacob picking up a bowling ball
from one of the racks.

25:55.931 --> 26:00.435
He started carrying this heavy ball
over to where this boy was sitting.

26:01.270 --> 26:02.813
Jacob kept walking toward him.

26:04.648 --> 26:08.026
And I swear he was staring at the back
of this boy's head in a way that...

26:11.363 --> 26:15.325
Anyway, I rushed over,
and I snatched the ball out of his hands.

26:15.409 --> 26:17.119
I don't think anyone even noticed.

26:18.829 --> 26:21.081
But the way Jacob looked at me,
it was like...

26:22.207 --> 26:23.208
nothing.

26:24.501 --> 26:26.003
No fear. No shame.

26:27.254 --> 26:29.506
Just... nothing.

26:40.184 --> 26:42.311
I don't even know
why I'm telling you this.

26:42.394 --> 26:45.147
Now that I'm saying it out loud,
it sounds even crazier.

26:45.647 --> 26:47.316
I mean, he was five.

26:48.984 --> 26:50.694
Do you think Jacob
was trying to harm this other boy?

26:50.777 --> 26:51.904
No, I don't.

26:52.613 --> 26:53.947
Honestly, I don't.

26:56.909 --> 26:58.160
But what if he was?

27:00.329 --> 27:02.998
And I just didn't look closely enough?

27:04.708 --> 27:08.295
Then, in a way, isn't this all my fault?

27:12.508 --> 27:15.594
Have you heard of something
called the Boring figure?

27:15.677 --> 27:16.887
You've probably seen it.

27:17.679 --> 27:21.725
It's a drawing that either looks like
an old woman looking at us

27:21.808 --> 27:24.269
or a young woman turning away from us.

27:24.353 --> 27:25.812
Yes, I know what you mean.

27:25.896 --> 27:29.066
It's what's known
as an ambiguous illusion.

27:29.149 --> 27:33.362
And I actually think it might be a fitting
analogy for what you experienced.

27:33.779 --> 27:34.780
It is?

27:35.447 --> 27:37.074
In a situation like yours,

27:37.157 --> 27:39.993
it's not uncommon to hold in your mind

27:40.077 --> 27:43.247
two radically different perceptions
of your child.

27:43.872 --> 27:45.749
In fact, it's understandable.

27:56.593 --> 27:58.178
I like the poster, by the way.

27:58.846 --> 28:00.264
The one in the waiting room.

28:01.098 --> 28:02.641
I don't know if you picked it out--

28:06.144 --> 28:07.437
It's soothing.

28:11.191 --> 28:12.192
I just...

28:13.360 --> 28:15.320
I just wish I knew what was real.

28:16.238 --> 28:18.407
Not just with Jacob, with everything.

28:19.199 --> 28:21.910
I think about the lives we had,
the people we were.

28:22.995 --> 28:24.621
It's like after someone dies...

28:25.747 --> 28:28.917
you know, and you have trouble
remembering their face.

28:34.548 --> 28:36.592
Maybe I'm just losing my mind.

28:37.718 --> 28:39.344
Laurie, this really isn't my place,

28:39.428 --> 28:43.140
but I do think it may be a good idea
for you to talk to someone.

28:44.057 --> 28:45.475
Couldn't I just talk to you?

28:46.101 --> 28:49.938
I'm a biological psychiatrist.
It's different.

28:52.065 --> 28:53.066
I just thought...

28:54.610 --> 28:55.611
Sorry.

29:05.037 --> 29:06.163
Thank you.

29:07.956 --> 29:08.790
Excuse us.

29:08.874 --> 29:10.792
-Hey, Mr. Barber.
-Hey, Sarah.

29:10.876 --> 29:13.712
We burned through that mint chip you
brought by, figured I'd pick up some more.

29:13.795 --> 29:16.298
Yeah, sure. Pint or half-gallon?

29:16.381 --> 29:17.883
Pint should do it.

29:20.719 --> 29:25.265
Hey, listen, Sarah, is there any chance
you and I could talk for a few minutes?

29:28.060 --> 29:29.061
Yeah, sure.

29:29.811 --> 29:31.647
I get my break at 4:30.

29:40.614 --> 29:42.032
-Hi.
-Hi.

29:43.492 --> 29:44.493
Please.

29:47.454 --> 29:49.081
Thank you for talking with me.

29:49.164 --> 29:51.625
And thank you for being
such a good friend to Jacob.

29:52.042 --> 29:55.045
It's not easy being isolated
the way he is and...

29:56.213 --> 29:58.674
Anyway, Laurie and I
really appreciate it, so...

29:58.757 --> 30:00.175
Yeah, sure, no problem.

30:01.301 --> 30:05.472
I was thinking about that day
that I interviewed you at the school

30:05.556 --> 30:07.516
and you asked me about Jacob, remember?

30:08.100 --> 30:09.101
I think so.

30:11.019 --> 30:13.605
Later that night I got an anonymous e-mail
from somebody

30:13.689 --> 30:16.316
directing me to what Derek wrote
about Jacob.

30:17.192 --> 30:18.402
That was you, wasn't it?

30:21.905 --> 30:23.866
I guess you were looking out for him
even then?

30:24.867 --> 30:26.076
Kind of, yeah.

30:29.288 --> 30:32.499
Sarah, are you the one who contacted
Detective Duffy about Derek?

30:36.003 --> 30:37.004
Why?

30:39.590 --> 30:40.757
He's gonna hate me.

30:41.800 --> 30:43.010
Who, Derek?

30:43.343 --> 30:44.344
Jacob.

30:44.720 --> 30:46.138
Jacob? Why?

30:53.353 --> 30:54.688
You know Ben's cell phone?

30:55.397 --> 30:57.691
The one that's missing?
Yeah, what about it?

30:57.774 --> 30:59.193
It wasn't missing.

31:00.694 --> 31:01.778
Derek had it.

31:06.408 --> 31:07.659
Start from the beginning.

31:12.706 --> 31:17.127
Well... Ben and I had this thing.

31:17.628 --> 31:20.380
It wasn't even that.
We were in the same English class.

31:20.464 --> 31:22.883
And so we'd talk sometimes.

31:23.592 --> 31:26.345
Sometimes we'd text at night.

31:27.012 --> 31:28.222
One night he...

31:30.557 --> 31:32.559
He asked me to send him a pic.

31:33.685 --> 31:36.063
Yeah, that kind.

31:37.105 --> 31:40.859
I tried to crop my face out, but you could
still see enough to tell it was me.

31:43.946 --> 31:46.073
On Monday,
Derek was at lacrosse practice

31:46.156 --> 31:48.784
and he overheard Ben
and some other kid talking about this...

31:50.619 --> 31:53.080
this blow job
he's gonna be getting from me.

31:57.835 --> 32:01.964
The next day he found me and, I mean,
he just kept asking me about it.

32:02.381 --> 32:05.926
And he wasn't gonna let it go
until I finally told him about the selfie.

32:06.593 --> 32:10.472
And that after I sent it to Ben,
Ben said...

32:12.057 --> 32:13.725
He said if I didn't give him a blow job,

32:13.809 --> 32:16.436
he was gonna send the photo out
to the entire school.

32:16.854 --> 32:18.438
How'd Derek react to that?

32:18.522 --> 32:19.898
He just got kinda quiet.

32:21.650 --> 32:23.527
And he said, "I'll deal with it."

32:24.528 --> 32:26.864
Well, the next day
Derek showed up at my house,

32:26.947 --> 32:29.491
and he said he wanted
to show me something.

32:32.953 --> 32:33.954
Hi.

32:34.872 --> 32:35.873
Here.

32:36.623 --> 32:37.624
It's Ben's.

32:38.041 --> 32:39.042
What?

32:39.126 --> 32:41.879
He said he stole it
from Ben's bag at lacrosse practice.

32:41.962 --> 32:43.589
We got in kind of a fight about it.

32:43.672 --> 32:45.883
Derek was pissed
I didn't want the phone but...

32:45.966 --> 32:47.092
This is bullshit.

32:47.176 --> 32:49.386
I never told him
to steal it in the first place.

32:49.469 --> 32:51.263
I mean, what if someone found out?

32:51.346 --> 32:53.557
Did he know
what kind of trouble we'd be in?

32:55.142 --> 32:56.310
I knew I'd hurt him.

32:57.144 --> 32:58.896
I mean, he'd done it all for me.

33:00.606 --> 33:01.815
And two days later...

33:04.067 --> 33:05.444
someone killed Ben.

33:07.112 --> 33:08.447
"I'll deal with it."

33:08.947 --> 33:11.575
Derek could've just been referring
to stealing Ben's phone.

33:11.658 --> 33:14.119
-But maybe not.
-Maybe Ben found out about the theft.

33:14.203 --> 33:15.704
Maybe Ben and Derek fought.

33:15.787 --> 33:17.623
Maybe Derek was feeling
so rejected by Sarah

33:17.706 --> 33:19.625
that he wanted to really prove
his love for her.

33:19.708 --> 33:22.503
I agree. It is potent. It's motive.

33:22.586 --> 33:24.296
But it is not exculpatory.

33:24.379 --> 33:26.632
No, not yet.
But I talked to Sarah about the phone.

33:26.715 --> 33:28.926
She thinks that if Derek destroyed it,
he would've told her.

33:29.009 --> 33:31.053
There's a chance that Derek
gave that phone to the police.

33:31.136 --> 33:32.137
You think Duffy has it?

33:32.221 --> 33:35.098
If CPAC has it in evidence,
we have the right to examine it.

33:35.182 --> 33:36.308
Who knows what's in that phone?

33:36.391 --> 33:40.020
I'll call Detective Duffy first thing
tomorrow and ask her about it myself.

33:40.103 --> 33:41.522
You did good, Andrew.

33:43.065 --> 33:45.359
Jacob, you've been pretty quiet.

33:47.736 --> 33:49.154
What does "exculpatory" mean?

33:49.238 --> 33:51.448
It's evidence that proves
a person isn't guilty.

33:54.535 --> 33:56.078
Well, I'm gonna head home.

33:56.745 --> 33:57.829
I'll walk you out.

33:59.039 --> 34:00.207
Thank you, Joanna.

34:02.167 --> 34:03.377
Good night.

34:09.675 --> 34:11.592
Hey. You okay?

34:12.219 --> 34:14.554
You looked like
you were having a hard time with that.

34:14.638 --> 34:17.391
Whatever. She's just a liar, that's all.

34:18.266 --> 34:19.601
I don't think that's fair.

34:19.976 --> 34:21.853
She kept a secret because she was scared.

34:22.563 --> 34:24.565
-She's still your friend.
-She's not my friend.

34:24.982 --> 34:26.149
What don't you get about that?

34:26.233 --> 34:29.235
She was only hanging out with me
because she felt bad about what she did.

34:29.319 --> 34:30.404
You don't know that for sure.

34:30.487 --> 34:31.487
Whatever.

34:45.460 --> 34:47.795
Everything is cool

34:49.715 --> 34:52.009
Everything's okay

34:53.594 --> 34:54.844
Why just b--

35:43.936 --> 35:47.689
What do you think about me taking Jacob
tomorrow to go fishing at Lake Lashaway?

35:48.440 --> 35:50.651
Remember that place I used to take him
when he was little?

35:51.193 --> 35:54.071
It's usually pretty empty.
It'd be easy to keep a low profile.

35:56.240 --> 35:58.116
He could probably use a little break.

35:58.784 --> 35:59.785
What do you think?

36:02.746 --> 36:03.747
Come here.

36:38.031 --> 36:39.366
The day you ambushed Derek...

36:39.449 --> 36:41.493
I didn't ambush Derek.

36:41.577 --> 36:43.579
I went to the school and he was there.

36:43.662 --> 36:44.663
Fine.

36:45.622 --> 36:51.336
Derek says that he told you about Jacob's
interest in something called "cutter."

36:52.546 --> 36:53.547
He did.

36:54.339 --> 36:55.507
What was your reaction?

36:56.216 --> 36:59.178
It worried me. But I also thought
Derek might've been lying.

36:59.720 --> 37:02.222
Had you ever heard about
anything like this before?

37:02.723 --> 37:03.724
Cutter porn?

37:03.807 --> 37:06.143
-No.
-Never caught Jacob looking at it?

37:06.226 --> 37:08.604
-Never showed up on his browser history?
-Never.

37:08.687 --> 37:09.730
Did you check his history?

37:09.813 --> 37:11.356
Of course. We're not idiots.

37:12.274 --> 37:13.609
Kids delete things.

37:13.692 --> 37:16.695
Derek mentioned a specific site
at this time too, didn't he?

37:17.196 --> 37:18.280
The Cut Up Room?

37:18.906 --> 37:20.824
-He did.
-Did you look into it?

37:21.283 --> 37:22.326
Yeah, I did.

37:22.409 --> 37:23.994
And what were your impressions?

37:24.411 --> 37:25.621
It's what I expected.

37:26.705 --> 37:28.123
Wasn't on it very long.

37:29.666 --> 37:31.543
How did Laurie feel about the site?

37:32.669 --> 37:34.129
I didn't tell her about it.

37:34.213 --> 37:38.634
No? You didn't feel
that she had the right to know?

37:40.010 --> 37:41.678
I was afraid she'd overreact.

37:42.763 --> 37:43.764
I see.

37:44.848 --> 37:46.308
But you thought it was okay?

37:46.391 --> 37:48.894
No. I didn't say that. Of course not.

37:50.312 --> 37:51.897
Did you talk to Jacob about it?

37:55.484 --> 37:56.485
I intended to.

37:56.568 --> 37:57.736
But did you?

38:01.114 --> 38:02.115
Andy.

38:03.575 --> 38:04.576
No.

38:27.140 --> 38:28.809
It's pretty good, right? Admit it.

38:28.892 --> 38:30.936
Yeah, it's not bad.
I like it better than the last one.

38:31.019 --> 38:33.438
It's got kind of
a Bryan Ferry thing going on.

38:33.981 --> 38:34.982
Who?

38:36.024 --> 38:37.025
Who?

38:40.070 --> 38:41.196
I'm picking the next one.

39:34.625 --> 39:35.709
Thank you.

40:01.443 --> 40:03.153
I feel like we're in a commercial.

40:03.987 --> 40:06.198
One of those father-son moments.

40:10.369 --> 40:11.745
Can I ask you a question?

40:13.247 --> 40:15.582
Was it weird seeing your dad again?

40:18.669 --> 40:19.670
A little.

40:22.589 --> 40:23.590
He look the same?

40:25.050 --> 40:27.469
Yeah, pretty much. Older.

40:29.471 --> 40:30.973
He was a dick to you, huh?

40:33.267 --> 40:34.852
That's one way to put it.

40:38.730 --> 40:39.731
You hate him?

40:42.526 --> 40:43.527
No.

40:44.736 --> 40:45.988
No, not really.

40:46.071 --> 40:47.990
You don't feel bad for him, do you?

40:48.073 --> 40:50.450
No. Not at all.

40:59.168 --> 41:00.586
Sorry you had to go through that.

41:03.839 --> 41:06.425
You wouldn't have had to go see him
if it wasn't for me.

41:06.967 --> 41:07.968
Hey.

41:08.760 --> 41:11.013
Hey, listen to me.

41:12.222 --> 41:14.725
There's nothing
I wouldn't do for you, okay?

41:16.018 --> 41:17.019
Nothing.

41:26.069 --> 41:27.029
Dad...

41:31.325 --> 41:32.326
I'm scared.

41:34.161 --> 41:35.370
I know you are.

41:36.413 --> 41:39.124
Believe me,
if I could take your place, I would.

41:39.208 --> 41:40.209
In a minute.

41:40.292 --> 41:44.379
I know. It's all I think about sometimes.
Going to jail.

41:45.756 --> 41:47.508
We're not going to let that happen.

41:50.761 --> 41:51.762
Bribe the jury?

41:54.348 --> 41:56.225
Trial's still eight weeks out, buddy.

41:57.851 --> 41:59.561
Seven weeks, three days.

42:01.813 --> 42:03.440
That's still a lot of time.

42:03.982 --> 42:06.068
Anything can happen between now and then.

42:06.151 --> 42:10.322
And if we go to trial, we're gonna
fight harder than anyone's ever fought.

42:11.698 --> 42:13.825
They gotta convince all 12 jurors.

42:13.909 --> 42:15.285
We just gotta convince one.

42:16.537 --> 42:20.707
Look, I know it's hard, buddy, but why
don't you leave the worrying to me, okay?

42:28.090 --> 42:31.385
You wanna make yourself useful?
Catch us some dinner.

42:34.596 --> 42:35.931
That was fun. Thanks, Dad.

42:36.014 --> 42:38.433
-Movie night?
-Sure.

42:38.517 --> 42:39.852
You wanna choose or should I?

42:41.895 --> 42:44.439
Are there any good Eddie Murphy ones
I haven't seen yet?

42:44.523 --> 42:46.316
Yeah, absolutely. Let me think...

42:47.651 --> 42:48.986
Hang on a second, buddy.

42:52.197 --> 42:53.031
Joanna.

42:53.115 --> 42:54.992
I tried you earlier.
It kept going to voice mail.

42:55.075 --> 42:56.535
Yeah, sorry, we're in a bad area.

42:56.618 --> 42:59.746
CPAC has Ben's phone.
Derek turned it over.

43:00.706 --> 43:03.041
-Really?
-I just brought a motion to compel.

43:03.125 --> 43:05.502
If there is anything on that phone,
we'll get to see it.

43:06.170 --> 43:09.464
Logiudice looked like
he just locked his keys in his car.

43:09.965 --> 43:10.966
Yeah, I bet.

43:11.049 --> 43:12.759
Oh, and I have more news.

43:12.843 --> 43:16.138
I got a message from Liz Vogel
when I was at the courthouse.

43:16.221 --> 43:18.557
Apparently your father's
had a change of heart.

43:19.099 --> 43:21.977
-What do you mean?
-He's agreed to give a DNA sample.

43:22.060 --> 43:25.105
She's going back to the prison
to pick it up first thing in the morning.

43:30.068 --> 43:31.570
Andy, did I lose you?

43:32.279 --> 43:36.116
No, I'm here. Just...
You sure he's not messing with us?

43:36.783 --> 43:38.785
It doesn't sound that way.

43:38.869 --> 43:42.039
Listen, I have to go.
We'll talk tomorrow, okay?

43:42.122 --> 43:44.208
-Okay. Thanks, Joanna.
-Bye-bye.

43:49.296 --> 43:50.297
What's wrong?

43:50.797 --> 43:53.050
Nothing. That was actually good news.

43:55.511 --> 43:56.553
Tell your face.

43:59.431 --> 44:01.016
Hi, Ferris. How's your bod?

44:02.768 --> 44:04.520
Oh, my God. You're dying?

44:04.603 --> 44:05.979
Uh-oh.

44:09.233 --> 44:11.860
-Is it serious?
-I don't know. I hope not.

44:12.945 --> 44:14.696
Think I may need a kidney transplant.

44:14.780 --> 44:16.198
Shit.

44:17.199 --> 44:18.534
Are you upset?

44:42.432 --> 44:44.226
You went to go see him today, didn't you?

44:46.728 --> 44:48.230
You got him to change his mind.

44:50.399 --> 44:51.942
We only talked for a few minutes.

44:53.443 --> 44:55.445
He wasn't as scary
as I thought he would be.

44:59.366 --> 45:00.450
You didn't have to do that.

45:04.872 --> 45:05.873
Yes, I did.

45:09.376 --> 45:10.377
What?

45:11.837 --> 45:13.005
You have his eyes.

46:10.771 --> 46:11.939
Hello?

46:14.650 --> 46:15.651
Who is this?

46:19.279 --> 46:20.280
Hello?

46:34.920 --> 46:35.838
Damn it.

46:42.886 --> 46:43.887
Hello?

46:47.266 --> 46:48.642
Look, either have the guts
to say something

46:48.725 --> 46:50.394
or don't call this number again.

46:51.895 --> 46:52.938
Fuck!

47:05.576 --> 47:08.620
Matt, turn down the music!
