ADULT ADAM: <i> The '80s</i>
<i> had a lot of pop trends,</i>

00:02.770 --> 00:04.336
<i> and my sister</i>
<i> was into all of them.</i>

00:04.338 --> 00:06.372

00:09.043 --> 00:12.011

<i> lasted only a week or so,</i>

00:12.013 --> 00:13.112
<i> some even shorter.</i>

00:13.114 --> 00:15.981

have fun, am I right?

00:15.983 --> 00:17.149

And it's over.

00:17.151 --> 00:18.851
<i> In fact,</i>
<i> the styles changed so fast</i>

00:18.853 --> 00:22.154
<i> that at school it was nearly</i>
<i> impossible to keep up,</i>

00:22.156 --> 00:23.989
<i> especially for Geoff Schwartz.</i>

00:23.991 --> 00:24.656

the flock today, am I right?

00:26.160 --> 00:28.527
Ugh. Flock of Seagulls
is so last week, Geoff.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.062
We're all about
Debbie Gibson now.

of honey for this.

(BEES BUZZING)
I've been fighting off bees
all morning.

00:33.901 --> 00:35.467
I told you.
I'm not gonna date you

00:35.469 --> 00:37.403
just 'cause
we love the same music.

00:37.405 --> 00:38.404
Yeah, bro.
If anything,

00:38.406 --> 00:41.673
you should hate her guts
for the crap she listens to.

00:41.675 --> 00:42.207
Whoa, I'm sorry.

00:42.209 --> 00:43.709
Do you have a problem,
Johnny Atkins?

00:43.711 --> 00:45.644
My problem is
your music sucks.

00:45.646 --> 00:46.278
Big mistake, bro.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.746
Yo, back me up, JTP.
That's a polite pass, bro.

00:47.748 --> 00:50.616
Your hair suggests you
don't know what you're
doing with your life.

00:50.618 --> 00:53.152
Well, you dodged a bullet,
homeboy.

00:53.521 --> 00:55.554
For your sake,
back off my girl.

00:55.556 --> 00:56.789
Not your girl.
I love you, Erica!

00:56.791 --> 00:58.657
You will be!
You guys need to get a clue.

00:58.659 --> 01:00.959
There's only one band
on the planet that matters.

01:00.961 --> 01:01.994
Rush.
Here we go.

01:01.996 --> 01:03.529
Not again.
Rush sucks.

01:03.531 --> 01:04.129
I hate you.
Ugh.

01:04.131 --> 01:05.731
They're not
the canned garbage
that you listen to.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.032
They're real.
They're from Canada.

01:07.034 --> 01:11.470
It's super-cold,
so they have to rock
super-hard to stay warm.

01:11.472 --> 01:12.805
I'll take your word for it.

01:12.807 --> 01:13.472
Why take my word for it

01:13.474 --> 01:16.442
when you can come
to my Corolla and
find out for yourself?

01:16.444 --> 01:17.209
Unless you're afraid.

01:17.211 --> 01:20.112
Of being alone with you in
your rusted-out piece of crap?

01:20.114 --> 01:20.779
For sure.

01:20.781 --> 01:23.382
Hey. Johnny Atkins
respects women.

01:23.384 --> 01:25.884
He has
bad hair days, too.

01:25.953 --> 01:27.252
Not many, though.

01:27.254 --> 01:28.954
You ready to step into
the musical cocoon

01:28.956 --> 01:30.722
and emerge
a rock-'n'-roll butterfly?

01:30.724 --> 01:33.692
Just play it

But I definitely will.

There's one thing
you should know about me.

02:03.190 --> 02:03.956
I'm painfully honest.

you this.

No. I want my own trophy

This is
a misunderstanding.

07:45.365 --> 07:46.565
See, this makes sense.

07:46.567 --> 07:49.134
And to prove you really are
the best son,

07:49.136 --> 07:52.604
I'm gonna focus all my time
and energy on you.

07:52.606 --> 07:55.006
Just please don't
say anything to Adam.

07:55.008 --> 07:58.210
And hurt his feelings?
I would never.

07:58.212 --> 08:00.946
Sorry, sucka!
Barry's number one.

08:00.948 --> 08:02.948
The trophy's mine forever.
Cool.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.916
Hope you enjoyed your day
as "Best Son"

08:04.918 --> 08:07.285
'cause now, mom's
only gonna focus on me.

08:07.287 --> 08:08.987
Ha!
Wait.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.355
Did she really say that?

08:10.357 --> 08:12.791
Absolutely.
Oh, my God.

08:12.793 --> 08:15.494
You literally are
the best brother ever.

08:15.496 --> 08:17.295
And the "Best Son."

08:17.297 --> 08:18.096
My mother's rejection of me

08:18.098 --> 08:20.699
is the most wonderful
birthday gift
I could ever get.

08:20.701 --> 08:23.201
It's your birthday?
From the bottom of my heart,

08:23.203 --> 08:25.203
thank you,
Barry Norman Goldberg.

08:25.205 --> 08:27.005
(LAUGHS)

08:27.307 --> 08:28.206
You're welcome.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.841
I feel like you're trying to
tell me something,

08:29.843 --> 08:32.944
but I'm too excited
to figure out what it is!

08:32.946 --> 08:34.679

08:36.250 --> 08:37.449
Hello, Father.

08:37.451 --> 08:38.283
Tell me something.

08:38.285 --> 08:40.285
By chance does this
"Battle of the Bands" flier

08:40.287 --> 08:42.287
look at all familiar
to you?

08:42.289 --> 08:43.788
Just say
what you're gonna say.

08:43.790 --> 08:45.557
I saw Johnny Atkins
at school today.

08:45.559 --> 08:48.727
He told me you
slammed the door in his face.

08:48.729 --> 08:49.294
Oh, that.

08:49.296 --> 08:52.163
Yeah, I only did that
because he's
a piece of (BLEEP)...

08:52.165 --> 08:54.199
You get it.
(SINGSONG) Gonna backfire.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.401
How could you be
so shallow and judgy?

08:56.403 --> 08:57.769
You don't even know him.

08:57.771 --> 08:59.004
(SINGSONG) Mistake.

08:59.006 --> 09:00.839
I know he's a teenage boy

09:00.841 --> 09:03.575
who associates with
fudge dealers.

09:03.577 --> 09:04.910
(SINGSONG) Here it comes.

09:04.912 --> 09:07.012
Johnny's, like,
super deep.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.547
He introduced me to Rush,

09:08.549 --> 09:09.314
he makes wax hands,

09:09.316 --> 09:10.715
and he even
wrote me a poem.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.050
Please don't.
I'll read it.

09:12.052 --> 09:15.820
"Her eyes
sparkle like the sun.
Erica."

09:15.822 --> 09:18.023
Don't bash the poem.

09:18.025 --> 09:19.291
I hate that poem.

09:19.293 --> 09:20.125
And I hate that boy.

09:20.127 --> 09:21.726
You are not
going out with him.

09:21.728 --> 09:24.162
What? You can't
tell me who to date!

09:24.164 --> 09:26.598
And yet, I just did.

09:26.600 --> 09:27.632
(SINGSONG) It's happening.

09:27.634 --> 09:32.604
Will you stop
singing ominous warnings?
It's done!

What'd I say?

09:42.749 --> 09:43.715
You said no going out,

09:43.717 --> 09:44.916
which is exactly why
we're staying in.

09:44.918 --> 09:49.220
That's not in the spirit of
our agreement and you know it.

09:52.392 --> 09:54.492
Shut up,
Ponytail Johnson!

09:54.494 --> 09:55.226
I joined Johnny's band,

09:55.228 --> 09:57.529
so we're gonna be
practicing here a lot.

No, I won't excuse you!

Don't do that!

Schmoopaloo,
Mama has some
truly tragic news.

10:19.853 --> 10:21.252
Barry's hockey game
this weekend

10:21.254 --> 10:24.122
is at the exact same time
as your party.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.490
You're... You're not
gonna be there?

10:25.492 --> 10:26.625
(SIGHS) Of course
we'll rush right back,

10:26.627 --> 10:28.793
but as far as
the planning goes
and everything...

10:28.795 --> 10:31.429
I'll plan it myself.
You don't have to
worry about anything.

10:31.431 --> 10:32.964
Okay.
Headed to practice.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.000
Not yet. Come
and eat this chili I made you.

10:35.002 --> 10:38.036
No, I'm not gonna eat
a bowl of chili before I play.

10:38.038 --> 10:38.837
It'll slow me down!

10:38.839 --> 10:40.839
Nonsense.
It'll give you strength.

10:40.841 --> 10:43.408
It's Mama's special
power chili.

10:43.410 --> 10:43.942
I don't want it.

10:43.944 --> 10:45.777
It's loaded
with meat and beans.

10:45.779 --> 10:46.645
I don't want it.

10:46.647 --> 10:48.046
It's Mama's special

10:48.048 --> 10:51.049
I'm not gonna eat
your special power chili.

10:51.051 --> 10:52.117
Look at the meat and beans.

10:52.119 --> 10:52.884
I see the meat and beans.

10:52.886 --> 10:54.152
I just don't want to eat
the meat and beans.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.621
Eat the damn meat and beans,
get some power,

10:56.623 --> 10:59.057
then wash it down with some
bone-strengthening buttermilk.

10:59.059 --> 11:02.560
No milk and no chili.
I have to skate
for three hours!

11:02.562 --> 11:03.762
That's why you need
the buttermilk.

11:03.764 --> 11:07.432
It coats the mouth
and belly from all
the power-giving chili.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.601
(GROANS) No.
There you go.

11:09.603 --> 11:11.236
It's so beany and meaty.

11:11.238 --> 11:12.270
Feel the beefy power.

11:12.272 --> 11:14.339
My tongue can't fight
the beefiness.

11:16.610 --> 11:17.308
Now you're ready.

11:17.310 --> 11:19.611
Just go make a boom-boom

11:20.580 --> 11:22.547
Oh, I'm going
to every practice.

here in our den.

Hey there, Erica.

11:51.645 --> 11:52.577

in my living room?

from dating Atkins.

12:22.008 --> 12:23.575
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
he's an adult man

living amongst
the student body
as an undercover cop.

12:29.182 --> 12:30.148

12:30.150 --> 12:31.883
You completely ambushed me.

12:31.885 --> 12:33.118
I can't believe you.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.185
Not me.

your teacher,

12:35.655 --> 12:38.356

who so clearly loves you.

12:38.358 --> 12:39.758
Who is it?
I'll fight him.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.092
Well, I don't care
what any of you think.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.561
In fact, if I'm getting rid of
anybody, it's you guys.

12:43.563 --> 12:45.597
Yeah, not buying it.
Well, you better buy

It's an overwhelming feast
for the senses,

13:38.485 --> 13:40.451

to thank for it.

13:40.453 --> 13:41.219
Please?

any more

13:42.355 --> 13:44.789

for this week.

I didn't say
a word to the girl.

14:28.869 --> 14:30.468
Instead of
telling her yourself,

14:30.470 --> 14:33.371
you had everyone else
in her life gang up on her.

14:33.373 --> 14:36.007
You took a love
forbidden by her father

14:36.009 --> 14:38.409

Wow. That's really good.
You wrote that?

14:50.490 --> 14:51.656
Yeah. And I never
would have thought

to put a 10-minute drum solo
in the middle.

Johnny Atkins doesn't
put labels on things.

15:06.139 --> 15:08.406

I kind of went out on a limb

So you're saying
the roller coaster goes down?

15:26.359 --> 15:27.292
No. I definitely think

15:27.294 --> 15:29.260
we should take things
to the next level,

15:29.262 --> 15:31.296

"Ehhh."

the other kids sick.

16:04.798 --> 16:05.897

done it easily.

Too bad she's busy
ruining my life.

16:35.061 --> 16:36.160

16:36.162 --> 16:36.828

I take it back.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.135

He's the best son.

miss your mama?

16:50.443 --> 16:51.376
Okay, fine. I do.

live with the idea

17:07.594 --> 17:10.361
that you think
I love Adam more than you.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.463
No. Adam's your baby.

17:12.465 --> 17:13.264
Always will be.

with the guy...
