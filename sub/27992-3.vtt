WEBVTT

00:03.280 --> 00:06.920
It appears to be
the body parts of a young male.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.285
Daniel came here to find his sister Zezi.

00:10.320 --> 00:15.430
Give them what they want.
They'll kill me! Please find a way!

00:15.471 --> 00:18.375
Jamie? I need some help here!

00:18.400 --> 00:20.404
Prentice and Carla are both dead.

00:20.404 --> 00:23.043
I should've helped her.
Instead, I just ran.

00:23.044 --> 00:24.443
Local family killed.

00:24.444 --> 00:27.443
No-one will care about
my Daniel and Zezi.

00:27.444 --> 00:29.523
The Hayes and Daniel Ugara are connected?

00:29.524 --> 00:31.763
There's something
much bigger behind this.

00:31.764 --> 00:33.243
Something organised.

00:33.244 --> 00:36.043
You think a trafficking gang
is working on the island?

00:36.044 --> 00:38.684
- Paul Kiernan.
- Real name Aaron McGuire.

00:39.684 --> 00:41.203
Are we going to have a problem?

00:41.204 --> 00:42.603
No.

00:42.604 --> 00:46.443
We think that Zezi is being
held by people traffickers.

00:46.444 --> 00:50.723
Have you got any idea
who you're dealing with here?

00:50.724 --> 00:55.564
I was on your boat, Calum, and I saw
the fish hold that you kept them in.

00:56.684 --> 01:00.004
This thing is huge.
These people are everywhere.

01:01.724 --> 01:04.700
Calum? Calum!

01:31.084 --> 01:33.243
- When did you find him?
- About 20 minutes ago.

01:33.244 --> 01:35.123
Ah, Christ, Billy!

01:35.124 --> 01:37.284
I know. I know.

01:46.604 --> 01:47.723
How's he doing?

01:47.724 --> 01:49.523
Not good. He's lost a lot of blood.

01:49.524 --> 01:51.780
We have to get him to the hospital
as soon as possible.

01:55.804 --> 01:58.804
Right. Let's give these guys
some room to work.

02:17.524 --> 02:19.363
You did a risk assessment, right?

02:19.364 --> 02:20.940
Yes, of course.

02:22.044 --> 02:24.364
- I'll need to see it.
- Mm-hmm.

02:26.244 --> 02:28.124
When did you last check on him?

02:29.244 --> 02:32.364
About 40 minutes before I found him.

02:36.004 --> 02:37.964
Where did he get the pen from?

02:40.164 --> 02:41.484
I gave it to him.

02:43.924 --> 02:45.403
He gave me no clue he was suicidal.

02:45.404 --> 02:47.843
I didn't think for a minute
he'd do something like this.

02:47.844 --> 02:50.820
Well, he was about to lose his boat,
his livelihood.

02:54.244 --> 02:55.804
Maybe you should have.

03:02.164 --> 03:04.284
Inform the Custody Inspector.

03:05.964 --> 03:08.404
Then go and get yourself cleaned up.

03:11.084 --> 03:12.483
I'll go and tell his wife.

03:12.484 --> 03:14.643
No, I'll talk to her.
I was the custody officer.

03:14.644 --> 03:16.604
That's not a good idea.

03:19.524 --> 03:20.820
Go on.

03:31.524 --> 03:32.940
What is it?

03:33.684 --> 03:36.443
Morag, Calum's tried to
take his own life.

03:36.444 --> 03:38.443
I'm going to take you to the hospital.

03:38.444 --> 03:42.260
Don't worry about the kids.
WPC Kirk's going to take care of them.

03:44.964 --> 03:46.684
Is he going to be all right?

03:48.884 --> 03:50.643
I don't know. I'm sorry.

04:10.044 --> 04:11.963
I need a hand in here, please.

04:11.964 --> 04:13.803
Call upstairs for the defib.

04:13.804 --> 04:15.043
He is unresponsive.

04:15.044 --> 04:17.322
Can I have some IV access
and adrenaline packs, please?

04:17.324 --> 04:18.762
What's going on?

04:18.764 --> 04:20.363
What's happening?

04:26.284 --> 04:28.243
What's happening to him?
What are you doing?

04:28.244 --> 04:31.004
Is he going to be OK? Calum!

04:39.084 --> 04:42.084
Calum Dunwoody died about 15 minutes ago.

04:54.724 --> 04:56.283
Do we know why he did this?

04:56.284 --> 04:57.804
He was so scared.

05:00.724 --> 05:03.844
He was so scared,
he'd rather die than talk.

05:05.364 --> 05:08.803
I'll need to take statements
from both Sandy and Billy.

05:08.804 --> 05:10.723
We have to establish whether
their actions

05:10.724 --> 05:13.003
- contributed to Calum Dunwoody's death.
- Yeah, OK.

05:13.004 --> 05:15.483
Tosh can deal with that.
I'm still heading to Glasgow.

05:15.484 --> 05:19.963
Just to be clear,
this could get messy for Sandy.

05:19.964 --> 05:22.637
The PIRC are going to want
to interview all of you.

05:22.662 --> 05:23.580
I know.

05:24.524 --> 05:26.604
But we need to find Zezi.

05:28.324 --> 05:32.323
I think she's the key as to why
Daniel and Prentice were killed.

05:32.324 --> 05:33.844
And McGuire's got her.

05:35.924 --> 05:37.684
I'm sure.

05:39.444 --> 05:40.940
And what about Carla?

05:41.484 --> 05:42.650
I just...

05:44.084 --> 05:46.603
I just don't understand.

05:46.604 --> 05:48.004
How does she fit in?

05:49.044 --> 05:50.180
OK...

05:50.724 --> 05:53.164
What is it that
you're not telling me about this?

06:00.044 --> 06:01.443
When I first arrived,

06:02.900 --> 06:05.460
Carla befriended me and we got close.

06:08.324 --> 06:12.643
And it developed into something else.

06:12.644 --> 06:14.460
Something deeper.

06:15.620 --> 06:17.204
Rhona...

06:19.644 --> 06:21.563
You should have said.

06:21.564 --> 06:23.460
I just want to know what happened to her.

06:24.164 --> 06:27.617
Make sure you get the statements
to the Custody Inspector

06:27.618 --> 06:31.043
and then go and talk to
Jamie Hayes again.

06:31.044 --> 06:34.443
And this time... This time,
put a wee bit more pressure on him.

06:34.444 --> 06:35.980
Don't worry. I will.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.537
I've got the money.

06:38.562 --> 06:40.500
Not all of it, but enough.

06:41.244 --> 06:42.643
Where did you get it?

06:42.644 --> 06:44.818
Well, it don't matter
how or where I got it.

06:44.819 --> 06:47.403
I got it. So tell 'em I'll pay.

06:47.404 --> 06:48.443
I can't do that, Olivia.

06:48.444 --> 06:51.123
You know that I don't have any way
of communicating with them.

06:51.124 --> 06:54.181
The media. Put it on the news, like
you did Daniel's photograph.

06:54.182 --> 06:56.723
No. No. Honestly, Olivia, it won't work.

06:57.220 --> 07:00.083
We'll just get inundated
with crank calls.

07:00.084 --> 07:02.323
Look, I heard you found drugs
up at the Hayes place.

07:02.324 --> 07:05.043
So Daniel might have found that
while he was looking for Zezi

07:05.044 --> 07:06.540
and these people might have killed him.

07:07.244 --> 07:08.323
OK, maybe.

07:08.324 --> 07:10.803
And that boy in hospital
will know what happened?

07:10.804 --> 07:13.380
Yes, but I don't know that yet.

07:14.604 --> 07:18.620
Once I get a clearer picture,
then I'll get in contact with you.

07:20.804 --> 07:23.483
Now, I'm sorry, but I have to go.

07:23.940 --> 07:26.884
And what am I supposed to do?
Just sit here and wait?

07:30.084 --> 07:32.260
- I understand how difficult...
- No, you don't!

07:33.151 --> 07:34.780
Don't say that.

07:35.444 --> 07:37.364
Cos you haven't got a clue.

08:01.204 --> 08:03.523
- Detective Inspector Perez?
- Hi.

08:03.524 --> 08:06.243
DCI Sam Boyd, trafficking unit.
We spoke on the phone.

08:06.244 --> 08:07.564
Car's this way.

08:14.804 --> 08:17.603
Sounds like you've got
your hands full up there.

08:17.604 --> 08:19.803
To be honest, it doesn't surprise me.

08:19.804 --> 08:21.123
Why's that?

08:21.124 --> 08:23.540
The people involved in trafficking,

08:24.324 --> 08:26.340
life means nothing to them.

08:26.957 --> 08:28.980
What about Aaron McGuire?

08:29.484 --> 08:33.482
He's a thug, no doubt about that,
but no history of people smuggling.

08:33.484 --> 08:36.602
So what's he doing running a hotel
up in Shetland

08:36.604 --> 08:39.243
with just mattresses on the floor, then?

08:39.244 --> 08:42.363
That's a fair question. I don't know.

08:42.364 --> 08:43.924
Let me show you something.

08:59.964 --> 09:04.283
Our big problem at the moment
is Romanian girls.

09:04.284 --> 09:07.003
In this street alone,
there's about three or four flats

09:07.004 --> 09:10.883
with trafficked girls in them,
all run by different gangs.

09:10.884 --> 09:14.563
And those girls there, they're
brought in from Eastern Europe

09:14.564 --> 09:19.963
to marry Pakistani men, so that
those men can get an EU passport.

09:19.964 --> 09:21.763
It's a lucrative trade.

09:21.764 --> 09:24.924
And one that's coming to an end,
so they're busy.

09:26.484 --> 09:28.443
And what about Nigerian girls?

09:28.444 --> 09:29.683
Yeah.

09:29.684 --> 09:34.963
Nigeria, Syria, south east Asia,
lots of places.

09:34.964 --> 09:38.604
And if we pick them up, they just go
straight back to their handlers.

09:39.844 --> 09:41.123
Is that those guys?

09:41.124 --> 09:42.563
Yeah.

09:42.564 --> 09:44.563
They run a car wash business.

09:44.564 --> 09:48.220
In fact, that's maybe where
your missing men could turn up.

09:48.724 --> 09:50.420
It's all about control.

09:50.884 --> 09:53.523
We call it extreme exploitation.

09:53.524 --> 09:55.420
And McGuire...

09:56.644 --> 10:00.203
He just doesn't have the clout
to instil that level of fear.

10:00.204 --> 10:01.524
Not on his own, anyway.

10:03.164 --> 10:05.684
He wasn't up in Shetland
for the fresh air, Sam.

10:07.564 --> 10:11.883
Your hotel in Shetland
was a safehouse along the pipeline.

10:11.884 --> 10:14.163
McGuire is a foot soldier, not a general.

10:14.164 --> 10:16.563
What... pipeline?

10:16.564 --> 10:20.203
That's what they call
the route from there to here.

10:20.204 --> 10:23.363
Now they're using the smaller ports,
coming in through the back door.

10:23.364 --> 10:26.883
And what we need is for you guys
to close that door.

10:26.884 --> 10:28.444
Is that right?

10:31.684 --> 10:34.140
So how do I find him?

10:34.684 --> 10:37.204
I think his ex-wife
might be our best bet.

10:44.684 --> 10:48.203
I haven't seen my ex-husband
in two years.

10:48.204 --> 10:50.603
And I don't want to either.

10:50.604 --> 10:52.564
It's a relief, having him out of my life.

10:54.004 --> 10:55.397
So you wouldn't know what he was doing

10:55.398 --> 10:58.083
running a hotel on Shetland, then?

10:58.084 --> 11:00.363
A hotel on Shetland?

11:00.364 --> 11:02.043
Doesn't sound like him at all.

11:02.044 --> 11:04.723
He was using a false name. Paul Kiernan.

11:04.724 --> 11:07.500
Really? Listen, I'm sorry,
I can't help you.

11:07.501 --> 11:10.163
I don't know what he's involved in.
Although nothing would surprise me.

11:10.164 --> 11:12.020
What about people trafficking?

11:12.604 --> 11:13.843
What?

11:13.844 --> 11:16.843
We think he's involved in bringing
people into the country illegally,

11:16.844 --> 11:22.523
then forcing them to work for little
or no wages, or as domestic slaves.

11:22.524 --> 11:25.403
Can we have a list of
your staff and clients?

11:25.404 --> 11:27.883
We'd just like to
check their residency papers.

11:27.884 --> 11:30.843
Make sure none of them
are being exploited.

11:30.844 --> 11:32.763
Yeah, well, I can assure you,

11:32.764 --> 11:37.043
we only supply household staff
that are legal and willing.

11:37.044 --> 11:39.723
Nothing to hide, then, have you?

11:39.724 --> 11:42.363
You know, this is beginning
to feel like harassment.

11:42.364 --> 11:44.923
Look, your ex-husband
could be involved in

11:44.924 --> 11:47.203
as many as three deaths on Shetland.

11:47.204 --> 11:49.660
So you're lucky we're not
tearing this place apart.

11:53.124 --> 11:56.843
If he gets in touch with you,
you contact me straight away.

11:56.844 --> 11:59.220
Or I'll consider it
obstruction of justice.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.523
You believe her?

12:09.524 --> 12:10.884
No.

12:13.644 --> 12:17.243
Thanks for this, Sandy. So I just
need to ask you a few more questions

12:17.244 --> 12:20.323
about the hours before
Calum Dunwoody took his own life.

12:20.324 --> 12:21.500
Sure.

12:22.164 --> 12:26.363
His last conversation with you,
he asked for pen and paper.

12:26.364 --> 12:28.003
- You gave it to him.
- That's correct.

12:28.004 --> 12:29.923
- Did he write anything down?
- No.

12:29.924 --> 12:32.363
And you had no reason to think
he was going to use the pen

12:32.364 --> 12:35.283
- to kill himself.
- No. Would you?

12:35.284 --> 12:36.980
That's not really relevant, is it?

12:37.884 --> 12:39.484
No.

12:40.484 --> 12:42.380
Did you talk about anything else?

12:43.164 --> 12:46.283
He asked me to tell his wife
to get off the Isles,

12:46.284 --> 12:47.764
to go to her mother's.

12:49.444 --> 12:52.060
And how did he seem when he asked this?

12:52.684 --> 12:54.323
What do you mean?

12:54.324 --> 12:58.443
Well, did he seem frightened, agitated?

12:58.444 --> 13:00.284
No, not really.

13:01.444 --> 13:04.300
And did you? Tell Morag?

13:04.804 --> 13:05.980
No.

13:06.604 --> 13:10.180
I said I would, but only if
he told me who he was working for.

13:11.484 --> 13:13.604
That was the last time we spoke.

13:15.884 --> 13:17.483
OK.

13:17.484 --> 13:18.896
Thanks, Sandy.

13:18.897 --> 13:21.683
The review commission
will want to interview you.

13:21.684 --> 13:23.687
Now, it's voluntary, you can refuse,

13:23.688 --> 13:26.700
but I suggest you play ball.

13:27.484 --> 13:29.283
Do you think I'm in trouble?

13:29.284 --> 13:32.003
I'll have to wait until PIRC
concludes their investigations

13:32.004 --> 13:34.884
before I decide whether further
action should be taken.

13:43.524 --> 13:47.163
It's possible that Prentice
was involved with Aaron McGuire.

13:47.164 --> 13:50.524
Do you think this had anything to do
with the attack on your family?

13:54.164 --> 13:57.003
You're not telling us
the whole story, Jamie.

13:57.004 --> 13:58.843
And you need to.

13:58.844 --> 14:01.043
The more you lie,
the less you look like a victim.

14:01.044 --> 14:02.683
Do you understand what I'm saying?

14:02.684 --> 14:04.363
None of this is my doing.

14:04.364 --> 14:06.563
But you knew, and you didn't do anything.

14:06.564 --> 14:08.364
I was scared of my brother.

14:10.884 --> 14:13.324
He, he wouldn't listen to me or Mum.

14:15.764 --> 14:17.644
He brought this on himself.

14:20.404 --> 14:22.443
Did he kill Daniel?
Is that what you mean?

14:22.444 --> 14:23.740
No.

14:24.524 --> 14:25.900
I don't know.

14:27.164 --> 14:28.724
I just...

14:30.324 --> 14:32.283
Everyone hated us.

14:32.620 --> 14:34.260
Because of him.

14:34.964 --> 14:37.484
Because of the way he treated people.

14:38.644 --> 14:40.643
So, who did he treat badly?

14:40.644 --> 14:42.923
The people who worked for him?

14:42.924 --> 14:46.620
Aye. And the girls up in the caravans.

14:47.884 --> 14:49.364
Like Rosie.

14:52.004 --> 14:54.204
He treated everybody like dirt.

15:09.604 --> 15:12.803
You OK? You got to get back
for family or...?

15:12.804 --> 15:15.043
No. No family.

15:15.044 --> 15:16.243
You?

15:16.244 --> 15:20.260
Er... I've got a daughter.
She's left home, though.

15:28.484 --> 15:31.644
Looks like Claire McGuire's
going somewhere.

15:36.004 --> 15:37.644
OK, that's her.

15:57.964 --> 15:59.940
I just spoke to Jamie.

16:00.484 --> 16:03.483
He didn't like the way Prentice
treated the girls in the caravans.

16:03.484 --> 16:06.243
Especially the one called Rosie.

16:06.244 --> 16:08.523
I still feel like he knows
more about the attack

16:08.524 --> 16:10.524
- than he's letting on.
- OK.

16:11.524 --> 16:13.580
Listen, check with Cora,

16:14.404 --> 16:16.644
see if those wounds could
be self-inflicted.

16:18.444 --> 16:21.603
And then find Rosie.
Be good to talk to her again.

16:21.604 --> 16:22.883
Yeah, OK, will do.

16:22.884 --> 16:25.443
I'll put someone outside the Hayes
place for a couple of days,

16:25.444 --> 16:28.204
- just to be on the safe side. OK?
- OK. Good idea.

17:33.684 --> 17:35.244
Police...

17:36.804 --> 17:39.123
We're going nowhere
until you open this door.

17:41.364 --> 17:42.844
Thank you, thank you.

17:53.884 --> 17:55.260
Zezi?

17:56.164 --> 17:57.523
No, it's OK.

17:57.524 --> 18:00.363
It's all right.
Don't be scared. Don't be scared.

18:00.364 --> 18:01.484
Stay here.

18:02.604 --> 18:04.283
A young girl in here.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.140
I've checked the living room.

18:11.724 --> 18:14.380
No, it's all right. It's OK.

18:15.124 --> 18:16.843
Does anyone speak English?

18:16.844 --> 18:19.060
We need to know where you came from.

18:19.604 --> 18:21.163
Where are you from?

18:21.164 --> 18:24.483
- Hotel.
- Hotel?

18:24.484 --> 18:26.364
Hotel.

18:27.910 --> 18:29.630
Is it this hotel?

18:36.924 --> 18:38.220
This girl?

18:38.898 --> 18:41.180
Did she travel with you?

18:42.844 --> 18:45.220
Did she... Look a wee bit closer.

18:45.804 --> 18:48.923
- I need to find this girl.
- No.

18:48.924 --> 18:51.620
There's nothing to be worried about.
Don't be scared.

18:53.324 --> 18:55.476
I don't know. I don't know her.

18:55.477 --> 18:57.620
I don't know anything. No.

18:58.737 --> 19:00.518
Any of you guys?

19:00.884 --> 19:02.684
Have you seen this girl?

19:03.964 --> 19:05.643
Are you sure?

19:05.644 --> 19:08.044
Hey, you. I want a word with you.

19:09.044 --> 19:10.364
In there.

19:13.244 --> 19:15.043
What are you doing here?

19:15.044 --> 19:17.443
Same as you. Looking for my ex-husband.

19:17.444 --> 19:18.963
What, he lives here?

19:18.964 --> 19:20.323
He owns the flat.

19:20.324 --> 19:21.803
Go through there.

19:21.804 --> 19:24.003
Look, if he is involved with
what you're suggesting,

19:24.004 --> 19:25.803
and if these people are being trafficked,

19:25.804 --> 19:27.763
then I need to know.
This is going to affect me.

19:27.764 --> 19:29.483
If they've been trafficked?

19:29.484 --> 19:32.283
I gave some of them jobs as cleaners.

19:32.284 --> 19:33.763
Aaron said it would do them a favour.

19:33.764 --> 19:35.963
They would send the money
back home to their families.

19:35.964 --> 19:38.884
You told me
you hadn't seen him for two years.

19:41.102 --> 19:43.763
I need back-up at 43 Calder Road.

19:43.764 --> 19:46.563
I have potential trafficking victims.

19:46.564 --> 19:48.083
Male and female.

19:48.084 --> 19:50.004
That's right. Soon as.

19:54.724 --> 19:56.660
Are you from Nigeria?

19:59.204 --> 20:00.900
Is she from Nigeria?

20:01.844 --> 20:03.780
Can you speak any English?

20:12.164 --> 20:14.164
Do you recognise this girl?

20:16.364 --> 20:18.100
It's all right, you're not in any
trouble.

20:18.101 --> 20:21.540
I just wondered if maybe you'd seen
her in the last few days?

20:25.510 --> 20:27.150
Don't be scared.

20:40.804 --> 20:42.700
Where did you get your tattoo?

20:43.524 --> 20:46.444
You? Who did this to you?

20:51.304 --> 20:53.744
She's not going to hurt you.

20:56.998 --> 20:58.998
Tell me about the tattoo.

21:01.937 --> 21:03.577
A woman do it.

21:04.684 --> 21:06.683
She came into the room.

21:06.684 --> 21:07.884
This room here?

21:10.844 --> 21:14.123
I remember was a cold room

21:14.124 --> 21:15.884
and the sound of the sea.

21:20.204 --> 21:21.768
Did you hear her name,

21:21.769 --> 21:26.084
or do you remember what she looked like?

21:27.710 --> 21:30.140
There was a snake on her hand.

21:31.044 --> 21:32.884
A snake with two heads.

21:35.204 --> 21:36.804
OK.

22:21.684 --> 22:23.683
- Sandy?
- I've got Rosie's home address.

22:23.684 --> 22:25.603
She's not been back there for weeks.

22:25.604 --> 22:27.683
No, she's still here.

22:27.684 --> 22:29.124
The milk's fresh.

22:32.964 --> 22:35.940
You know, I've seen that
butterfly tattoo before.

22:36.444 --> 22:38.324
On a girl in the Macbay Hotel.

22:39.444 --> 22:41.603
It could be branding.

22:41.604 --> 22:45.204
Traffickers like to mark girls
with their own logo.

22:46.804 --> 22:48.764
I know.

23:13.204 --> 23:17.043
Keep your mouth shut if
you want to see your kids grow up.

23:51.724 --> 23:54.923
Hey, there. How are you?

23:54.924 --> 23:57.763
Yeah, I'm fine. You busy?

23:57.764 --> 24:01.243
Chris is watching TV and I'm
just about to make something to eat.

24:01.244 --> 24:02.763
You OK?

24:06.164 --> 24:09.524
No. No, not really.

24:10.804 --> 24:12.324
What is it?

24:16.524 --> 24:19.124
Well, I'm trying to read this book.

24:20.844 --> 24:22.763
I see.

24:22.764 --> 24:24.100
Yeah.

24:25.580 --> 24:28.403
I'm not doing too well.

24:29.100 --> 24:31.580
Would you like me
to give you the short version?

24:32.364 --> 24:33.684
Yes, please.

24:34.844 --> 24:37.484
There is always something left in love.

24:46.204 --> 24:47.724
You believe that?

24:50.364 --> 24:51.764
Yes, I do.

24:54.204 --> 24:57.140
I spent my day in a house
full of trafficked people.

24:59.084 --> 25:02.100
And they were all scared,
and one of them was just a kid.

25:03.364 --> 25:05.563
And they didn't want my help.

25:05.564 --> 25:08.364
The world's broken, Jimmy,
and you can't fix it.

25:09.964 --> 25:11.564
Not everything.

25:12.924 --> 25:14.484
I know.

25:18.164 --> 25:19.724
I wish you were here.

25:25.604 --> 25:26.883
I have to go.

25:27.380 --> 25:29.404
OK. OK.

25:49.044 --> 25:50.323
Who was that?

25:50.324 --> 25:51.684
Oh, just work.

25:52.591 --> 25:54.871
I might have to stay late tomorrow.

26:11.724 --> 26:14.083
- What are you doing here?
- Come to see you.

26:14.084 --> 26:15.124
Hey.

26:24.284 --> 26:27.963
What is it? You keep staring at me.

26:27.964 --> 26:30.923
You're going to say you miss me. Don't.

26:30.924 --> 26:35.004
I miss you too, I miss Shetland,
and I don't need reminded.

26:35.924 --> 26:37.164
OK.

26:41.724 --> 26:43.524
Something you should know.

26:45.044 --> 26:46.884
Duncan and Mary have split up again.

26:48.691 --> 26:51.490
This time, I think it's the real deal.

26:51.684 --> 26:53.203
Well, what's he done now?

26:53.204 --> 26:54.523
No, no, no, no, no, no.

26:54.524 --> 26:56.443
He hasn't done anything.

26:56.444 --> 27:00.204
It's what Mary's done.
She's met someone else.

27:06.964 --> 27:09.363
How's Alan? See much of him?

27:09.364 --> 27:11.563
Yeah, he's, he's doing OK.

27:11.564 --> 27:13.923
Think he likes the city life.

27:13.924 --> 27:16.683
We could all go out for dinner
later, if you want.

27:16.684 --> 27:17.763
- Sure.
- Yeah?

27:17.764 --> 27:19.843
There's loads of great places around now.

27:19.844 --> 27:23.163
Not like in your day,
it was all chips and cheese.

27:23.164 --> 27:24.244
OK.

27:25.164 --> 27:27.660
Well, then I'll give you a phone
when, um,

27:28.764 --> 27:30.134
when I finish up.

27:30.135 --> 27:31.260
How's that?

27:31.261 --> 27:32.444
Cool.

27:36.517 --> 27:38.539
Oh, I'm this way, so I'll see you later.

27:38.564 --> 27:39.727
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

27:39.752 --> 27:41.603
Bye, darling.

27:41.604 --> 27:43.284
- Bye.
- See ya.

28:12.063 --> 28:15.742
I don't think Jamie's wounds could
have been self-inflicted, Tosh.

28:15.767 --> 28:19.406
The serrated edge of the knife
suggests a right-handed attacker.

28:19.431 --> 28:21.350
He's left-handed.

28:21.375 --> 28:24.054
And he's also got several
defensive wounds.

28:24.084 --> 28:25.803
It's unlikely.

28:25.804 --> 28:28.483
Unlikely, not impossible?

28:28.484 --> 28:30.460
No, not impossible.

28:31.244 --> 28:33.523
I suppose he could have turned
the knife round.

28:33.524 --> 28:35.523
Used the other hand.

28:35.524 --> 28:37.100
OK, cheers for that.

28:51.644 --> 28:53.124
Stay away from there.

28:55.564 --> 28:57.363
There's nothing for you to see out there.

28:57.364 --> 28:58.604
Is Niki all right?

28:59.440 --> 29:01.083
Niki's fine.

29:01.084 --> 29:05.163
Then why are you keeping us here?
I want to work.

29:05.164 --> 29:06.843
I can work. So can Niki.

29:06.844 --> 29:07.883
We need to work.

29:07.884 --> 29:09.043
We need to send money home.

29:09.044 --> 29:10.444
No, no, no, no, no, no.

29:11.924 --> 29:13.140
You're...

29:14.457 --> 29:15.936
...special,

29:15.961 --> 29:17.540
we don't want you sullied.

29:29.684 --> 29:31.203
That's it.

29:31.204 --> 29:32.483
Right. Come on.

29:40.764 --> 29:42.563
Jesus.

29:42.564 --> 29:44.324
For God's sake.

29:52.724 --> 29:54.244
Jesus Christ.

29:55.564 --> 29:57.124
Oh, bloody hell, don't!

29:59.924 --> 30:01.244
Come on.

31:10.324 --> 31:13.043
McGuire owns another
building on the South side.

31:13.044 --> 31:15.203
It's rented out to tenants
on housing benefit.

31:15.204 --> 31:16.643
No sign of him.

31:16.644 --> 31:18.883
We searched Claire's agency.

31:18.884 --> 31:21.643
She has workers coming in
from various countries.

31:21.644 --> 31:24.915
It's, it's possible that she's
taking on trafficked workers

31:24.916 --> 31:27.283
and splitting the wages
with their handlers.

31:27.284 --> 31:29.763
She's been told to cease trading
until further notice.

31:29.764 --> 31:33.283
Is there any way that we
could search the database

31:33.284 --> 31:35.843
for a tattooist with
a snake on their hands?

31:37.605 --> 31:40.203
Look, if you need to be somewhere
else, I can do this on my own.

31:40.204 --> 31:45.043
It's just I don't have time to,
to babysit you.

31:45.044 --> 31:47.723
I've got a pile of cases on my desk.

31:47.724 --> 31:49.363
And a missing girl isnae important?

31:49.364 --> 31:51.900
I have dozens of missing girls.

31:55.564 --> 31:56.604
OK.

31:57.924 --> 32:00.563
There's a tattoo parlour
on the South side.

32:00.564 --> 32:04.044
I know the tattooist there,
she might know someone.

32:04.964 --> 32:06.603
Don't ask.

32:06.604 --> 32:08.780
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

32:09.604 --> 32:10.860
I wasnae gonnae.

32:12.164 --> 32:15.163
- Hey.
- Hi, how you doing? Just take a seat.

32:15.164 --> 32:18.923
Oh, I'm not here for a tattoo,
I'm afraid.

32:18.924 --> 32:21.843
Looking for someone who does butterflies.

32:21.844 --> 32:23.563
Two-headed snake on her hand.

32:23.564 --> 32:24.644
Ring any bells?

32:26.484 --> 32:29.220
You know anybody with a two-headed snake?

32:30.184 --> 32:31.192
OK...

32:31.217 --> 32:34.643
Actually there was a place
in the town run by a woman.

32:34.644 --> 32:36.883
I think she might have had
a snake on her hand.

32:36.884 --> 32:38.363
Andrea.

32:38.364 --> 32:40.363
Haven't seen her for years.

32:40.364 --> 32:43.563
I think she sold her business
to Graeme Benson.

32:43.564 --> 32:45.963
- You know who I mean?
- Yep.

32:45.964 --> 32:47.980
Do you know what her second name was?

32:48.644 --> 32:51.060
Sorry, she was just Andrea to me.

32:55.924 --> 32:57.803
I want to talk to DC Wilson.

32:57.804 --> 33:00.564
- I'll check if he's available.
- Just get Sandy Wilson, now.

33:10.604 --> 33:11.803
She wants to talk to you.

33:11.804 --> 33:14.643
You can't talk to her until you've
made a statement to the PIRC.

33:14.644 --> 33:17.140
It's not a good idea to
ignore her either.

33:19.004 --> 33:20.340
I'll talk to her.

33:30.604 --> 33:33.043
I'm sorry, Morag,
but it's against standard procedure

33:33.044 --> 33:34.860
- for Sandy to talk...
- I want to know what he said to him.

33:35.660 --> 33:37.403
He threatened him, didn't he?

33:37.404 --> 33:39.337
If you want to make a complaint,
you'll have to contact

33:39.338 --> 33:41.141
the Independent Review Commission,
but I could help you with that.

33:41.142 --> 33:46.403
We have kids! Explain to them why
their dad comes to help the police

33:46.404 --> 33:48.003
and doesn't come home ever again.

33:48.004 --> 33:49.923
I want to know what was said.

33:49.924 --> 33:51.844
I want to know why he did this!

33:54.204 --> 33:55.763
Come out here and speak to me!

33:55.764 --> 33:57.744
Sandy didn't threaten your husband.

33:57.745 --> 34:00.044
How do you know? Were you there?

34:01.404 --> 34:06.620
Look, if you want to talk to me,
about anything, any time, just call.

34:08.804 --> 34:10.620
Why would I talk to you?

34:11.524 --> 34:12.964
Any of you?

34:23.850 --> 34:25.089
Cheers.

34:25.580 --> 34:29.643
OK, her name's Andrea Doyle,
there's no previous on her.

34:29.643 --> 34:31.203
Can't get an address for her.

34:31.204 --> 34:32.980
She seems to have dropped out of sight.

34:33.804 --> 34:36.402
All right, what about this Benson guy?

34:36.404 --> 34:38.922
He's a leading property developer
in the city.

34:38.924 --> 34:41.444
I doubt he'll have kept in touch
with somebody like Andrea.

34:43.964 --> 34:45.980
Yeah, I'd still like to talk to him,
though.

34:46.804 --> 34:48.043
OK.

35:31.444 --> 35:33.844
Are you all right? What's wrong?
What's happened to you?

36:01.404 --> 36:02.700
Thanks.

36:03.964 --> 36:05.163
Hello.

36:05.164 --> 36:07.220
Come on in. Um...

36:08.103 --> 36:09.422
...how can I help you?

36:09.447 --> 36:12.126
Actually, uh, would
you like a coffee or something?

36:12.164 --> 36:15.220
No, we're fine, Mr Benson,
we won't keep you.

36:16.844 --> 36:20.763
So, um, my secretary says that
you're looking for someone

36:20.764 --> 36:22.723
called Andrea Doyle?

36:22.724 --> 36:23.923
Is that right?

36:23.924 --> 36:27.403
You bought her business
a while back. A tattoo parlour.

36:27.404 --> 36:30.100
Well, technically,
I bought the whole building.

36:30.804 --> 36:33.763
We wondered if you'd
stayed in touch with her.

36:33.764 --> 36:35.923
She just seems to have disappeared
off the radar.

36:35.924 --> 36:37.843
No. No, I did not.

36:37.844 --> 36:40.123
I was after the building,
not the business.

36:40.124 --> 36:43.403
In fact, in the end,
I'm not even sure that I met her.

36:43.404 --> 36:45.803
She has a tattoo on her hand.

36:45.804 --> 36:47.683
A snake with two heads.

36:48.300 --> 36:50.244
Well, that I would remember.

36:52.084 --> 36:53.643
Has something happened to her?

36:53.644 --> 36:56.700
She might be involved
in people trafficking.

36:57.244 --> 36:58.460
Jesus.

36:59.564 --> 37:02.060
We really are on a race
to the bottom, aren't we?

37:02.364 --> 37:03.603
How do you mean?

37:03.628 --> 37:05.907
Desperate people do desperate things.

37:05.932 --> 37:09.251
And cheap labour helps absolutely nobody.

37:09.364 --> 37:12.283
If you don't pay someone a decent
wage, they can't spend any money.

37:12.284 --> 37:14.327
If they can't spend any money,
then the whole system doesn't work.

37:14.328 --> 37:17.500
But don't get me started.
You'll be here all day.

37:18.084 --> 37:20.803
Do you have outhouses as well?

37:20.804 --> 37:22.163
A few.

37:22.164 --> 37:24.883
You're very welcome to
look around on your way out.

37:24.884 --> 37:27.123
It is a fascinating building.

37:27.124 --> 37:29.043
It was built by a shipping magnate.

37:29.044 --> 37:31.643
And they say that he made boats
for the Confederate army

37:31.644 --> 37:33.283
during the Civil War.

37:33.284 --> 37:35.300
So a house built on slavery?

37:39.444 --> 37:40.764
You could say that.

37:43.324 --> 37:44.940
Where are you from?

37:45.484 --> 37:46.843
Nigeria.

37:46.844 --> 37:49.323
How did you get here?

37:49.324 --> 37:50.963
Amsterdam.

37:50.964 --> 37:53.443
We need to go to the police station.

37:53.444 --> 37:56.723
Maybe the hospital first.
That cut looks really bad.

37:56.724 --> 38:00.380
No, police, please, a police station.

38:00.564 --> 38:04.164
Darling, you'll be no use to your
friend if that cut gets infected.

38:06.564 --> 38:08.043
We're nearly there, darling.

38:08.044 --> 38:09.404
Don't worry.

38:10.604 --> 38:12.004
You'll be all right.

38:23.564 --> 38:24.843
No.

38:24.844 --> 38:26.284
Not here.

38:28.204 --> 38:30.083
Not here.

38:30.084 --> 38:31.404
Please.

38:32.964 --> 38:34.163
Please.

38:34.164 --> 38:35.644
No!

38:40.484 --> 38:42.404
- Move it!
- Please!

38:44.404 --> 38:45.684
- Move it!
- Please!

38:47.644 --> 38:49.123
Get in there!

38:49.124 --> 38:51.764
Now! Move it!

38:59.164 --> 39:01.203
I'm sorry I couldn't be more help.

39:01.204 --> 39:03.883
I'll check with my property manager,
see if he remembers her.

39:03.884 --> 39:05.420
That'd be great. Thanks.

39:06.004 --> 39:07.804
That's Shetland.

39:08.724 --> 39:09.963
I grew up there.

39:09.964 --> 39:13.260
That's the day me and a few old pals
went clay pigeon shooting.

39:15.284 --> 39:16.420
At Scalloway?

39:17.260 --> 39:18.900
That's it, yeah.

39:19.324 --> 39:21.060
- You know it.
- Yeah, I know it.

39:29.044 --> 39:30.300
Where are you going?

39:30.884 --> 39:33.083
- I know what you're thinking.
- What?

39:33.084 --> 39:35.523
The girl in the flat said
she heard the sound of the sea.

39:35.524 --> 39:36.803
I get that.

39:36.804 --> 39:39.100
He has a butterfly print. I get that too.

39:40.804 --> 39:42.284
And so what?

39:44.244 --> 39:45.603
You find it hard to believe

39:45.604 --> 39:48.379
that an all-round good guy would be
involved in trafficking, is that it?

39:48.380 --> 39:54.043
No. It's just, he doesn't need to,
not from a financial point of view.

39:54.044 --> 39:57.420
Look, he's from Shetland.
Now, he never mentioned the Hayes.

39:58.764 --> 40:00.803
You think he doesn't know
what happened to them?

40:00.804 --> 40:02.523
OK. What do you need?

40:02.524 --> 40:04.603
I just want to know where
all his money came from.

40:04.604 --> 40:06.604
- So, whatever you've got.
- OK.

40:10.444 --> 40:11.603
Sir?

40:11.604 --> 40:14.484
Tosh. Graeme Benson.

40:15.214 --> 40:17.483
Glasgow-based. Grew up on Shetland.

40:17.484 --> 40:20.003
I need to know if there was any
connection between him

40:20.004 --> 40:21.803
and Prentice Hayes.

40:21.804 --> 40:24.883
Phone calls, e-mails,
whatever you've got.

40:24.884 --> 40:27.323
I need to know if he was in touch.

40:27.324 --> 40:28.364
On it.

40:29.130 --> 40:31.980
Just had Morag Dunwoody's
lawyer on the phone.

40:32.724 --> 40:35.003
He's talking about
involuntary manslaughter

40:35.004 --> 40:36.683
and criminal negligence.

40:36.684 --> 40:38.203
She's going to bring charges?

40:38.204 --> 40:40.283
Isn't that up to the fiscal?

40:40.284 --> 40:42.603
They're talking about pursuing
a civil case.

40:42.604 --> 40:43.763
What?

40:44.340 --> 40:46.588
I've got a feeling she's going to
make this very difficult

40:46.589 --> 40:48.084
for all of us.

40:49.484 --> 40:51.524
You mean for me, don't you?

41:51.764 --> 41:53.283
Here. Give them this.

41:53.284 --> 41:56.483
It's the money, at least, as
much of it as I could get.

41:56.484 --> 41:57.523
Give it to 'em, please.

41:57.524 --> 41:59.243
Give who it? What are you on about?

41:59.244 --> 42:01.420
I just want my daughter back.

42:03.820 --> 42:05.923
Just tell them I just want her safe.
Tell them that.

42:05.924 --> 42:08.203
Tell who? I don't know anything
about your daughter.

42:08.204 --> 42:09.683
- Take it!
- Look, I can't.

42:09.684 --> 42:11.323
I don't know who I'd give it to.

42:11.324 --> 42:13.283
My Dan would have been about your age.

42:13.284 --> 42:15.563
Now Zezi is all I've got.

42:15.564 --> 42:17.243
And you understand that,

42:17.244 --> 42:19.203
cos you've lost people,
so don't lie to me,

42:19.204 --> 42:21.123
don't tell me that you don't
know anything.

42:21.124 --> 42:22.163
Just take the money.

42:22.164 --> 42:24.124
Take the fuckin' money! Take the mon...!

42:24.149 --> 42:26.804
What are you doing? Wait! Hang on!

42:38.124 --> 42:39.163
Hello?

42:39.164 --> 42:42.123
Hi, Hi, it's, it's me, Donnie.

42:42.124 --> 42:43.803
Got your number from Mags.

42:43.804 --> 42:44.963
Is this a good time?

42:44.964 --> 42:47.603
Olivia Lennox just paid a visit
to Jamie Hayes.

42:47.604 --> 42:48.643
Who?

42:48.644 --> 42:51.420
Donnie. The invisible man?

42:51.737 --> 42:52.789
No.

42:52.790 --> 42:56.203
I wondered, if you, uh,
fancied getting a drink later.

42:56.204 --> 42:57.643
- When?
- Just now.

42:57.644 --> 42:59.163
Tonight. Hopefully...

42:59.164 --> 43:02.043
She was trying to pay the ransom.
He said she was threatening him.

43:02.044 --> 43:04.083
A coffee, if you prefer.

43:04.084 --> 43:05.364
Oh, my God.

43:07.124 --> 43:08.243
Something to eat?

43:08.620 --> 43:10.043
I'll speak to Jamie.

43:10.044 --> 43:11.884
Find Olivia. We need to talk to her.

43:34.164 --> 43:35.244
Everything OK?

43:37.484 --> 43:39.883
Somebody's threatening my daughter.

43:39.884 --> 43:42.323
And I've got a pretty
good idea who it is.

43:42.324 --> 43:43.683
Right, we'll get those traced

43:43.684 --> 43:47.003
and I'll get an officer over to
the university straight away.

43:47.004 --> 43:48.164
OK.

43:51.644 --> 43:53.123
Hey, darling, how are you?

43:53.124 --> 43:54.286
Hey, Dad.

43:54.287 --> 43:55.700
Where are you?

43:56.244 --> 43:58.883
I'm just going to meet a friend
at the Kelvingrove Art Gallery.

43:58.884 --> 44:00.163
Why, are you cancelling?

44:00.164 --> 44:01.283
No, uh...

44:01.284 --> 44:03.483
Who is it that you're meeting?

44:03.484 --> 44:05.443
Just my friend Lynn. What is it?

44:05.444 --> 44:06.883
Stay inside.

44:06.884 --> 44:08.723
Just until I get there.

44:08.724 --> 44:11.036
And don't come out, OK? I need to
talk to you about something.

44:11.037 --> 44:12.243
OK.

44:12.244 --> 44:13.804
- Whatever you say.
- Yeah, bye.

44:14.924 --> 44:16.123
Kelvingrove Art Gallery.

44:16.124 --> 44:17.244
OK, sure thing.

44:33.124 --> 44:35.604
There she is, sat down,
with the checked jacket.

46:24.484 --> 46:26.243
- Hiya.
- Hi.

46:26.244 --> 46:28.803
I'm Cassie's dad. I need to
steal her away a wee minute.

46:28.804 --> 46:30.084
Sorry.

46:31.044 --> 46:32.563
What's going on?

46:32.564 --> 46:35.363
I'm putting you on a flight back
to Shetland, today.

46:35.364 --> 46:36.443
What?

46:36.444 --> 46:39.563
I need you back home,
so I can keep an eye on you.

46:39.564 --> 46:43.123
Uh, Dad, what are you on about?
I'm, I'm not going anywhere.

46:43.124 --> 46:44.203
It's only for a few days.

46:44.204 --> 46:46.323
I will call your tutors and explain.

46:46.324 --> 46:47.964
Explain? Explain what?

46:48.884 --> 46:51.300
Cassie, it's about you being safe.

46:51.964 --> 46:53.157
And you're not.

46:53.158 --> 46:54.418
Not here.

46:54.419 --> 46:56.100
Not right now.

46:57.364 --> 46:58.644
OK?

47:03.604 --> 47:05.403
That's what I'm saying!

47:05.404 --> 47:07.603
The bank won't give me an extension

47:07.604 --> 47:09.723
until they know
what your plans are with the house.

47:09.724 --> 47:12.163
Then I can get a loan to finish the bar.

47:12.164 --> 47:14.844
Come on, Mary,
all you've got to do is call them!

47:19.324 --> 47:22.203
Everything OK? You seem a bit stressed.

47:22.204 --> 47:25.323
Aye. Aye. Just haemorrhaging money.

47:25.324 --> 47:27.323
I need a gantry fitted in the brasserie

47:27.324 --> 47:30.123
and the guys that I usually use
have left me high and dry.

47:30.124 --> 47:32.163
But apart from that, tickety boo.

47:32.164 --> 47:33.404
- Cheers.
- Hm.

47:35.084 --> 47:38.243
Listen, I can do that gantry
for you, no problem.

47:38.244 --> 47:40.003
You've got your own house to do up.

47:40.004 --> 47:42.500
Och, a day here or there's not going
to make any difference.

47:43.204 --> 47:45.643
Are you sure? Seriously?
You'd be doing me a big favour.

47:45.644 --> 47:48.483
Just make sure you don't tell Alice,
right? Cos she'll kill me

47:48.484 --> 47:50.283
if I don't get our place finished.

47:51.684 --> 47:54.140
Oh, I have to take this, two ticks.

47:55.124 --> 47:56.243
Jimmy?

47:56.244 --> 47:57.843
Cassie's on the next flight, Duncan.

47:57.844 --> 47:59.646
So I'm going to need you to pick
her up at the airport.

47:59.647 --> 48:02.820
- OK. Is there a reason?
- Yeah, we've had a threat against her.

48:03.464 --> 48:04.817
It's probably nothing, but...

48:05.391 --> 48:07.403
safer if she's at home
for a couple of days.

48:07.404 --> 48:09.283
What kind of threat?

48:09.284 --> 48:12.790
It's nothing to worry about, Duncan.
I'm just playing it safe. OK?

48:12.791 --> 48:14.884
Just be there, all right?

48:19.804 --> 48:21.524
- I love you.
- I love you too.

48:33.204 --> 48:38.043
I don't think you should be talking
to lawyers, Morag, I really don't.

48:38.044 --> 48:40.180
And I'm saying that as a friend.

48:40.924 --> 48:42.244
You hardly know me.

48:44.084 --> 48:45.404
I know you well enough.

48:47.724 --> 48:49.340
And I know you're suffering...

48:50.444 --> 48:53.100
...but you're lashing out
at the wrong person.

48:53.564 --> 48:56.681
You should focus your anger
on the men who made Calum

48:56.682 --> 48:58.980
so afraid that he took his own life.

49:01.044 --> 49:02.540
And that was not me.

49:03.084 --> 49:04.740
You should have looked after him!

49:06.100 --> 49:07.884
You should have made him safe!

49:11.324 --> 49:12.484
I tried.

49:15.164 --> 49:18.123
But if Calum was involved
with traffickers,

49:18.124 --> 49:20.164
he got himself into this mess.

49:31.004 --> 49:34.724
Now, we've got two missing girls.

49:35.557 --> 49:38.020
And who knows what's happening to them?

49:38.844 --> 49:40.363
Morag.

49:40.364 --> 49:44.524
If Calum told you where they were
going, you have to tell me.

49:47.964 --> 49:50.804
Did he tell you anything?
Anything at all?

50:01.124 --> 50:02.924
He ferried the men across.

50:04.484 --> 50:06.803
But there were no women on the boat.

50:06.804 --> 50:08.403
Are you sure about that?

50:08.404 --> 50:10.067
Maybe he just didn't
see them get on board?

50:10.092 --> 50:11.588
No. There was only men.

50:13.284 --> 50:15.603
One of the women was ill.

50:15.604 --> 50:17.684
They didn't have time to wait for them.

50:24.604 --> 50:26.683
- How are you doing?
- I got something on Benson.

50:26.684 --> 50:28.683
He's got his hand in various enterprises.

50:28.684 --> 50:31.123
Nail bars, tanning salons, minicab firms.

50:31.124 --> 50:34.420
All types of businesses that
are known to use trafficked workers.

50:35.084 --> 50:37.803
But nothing on Shetland
apart from one property,

50:37.804 --> 50:40.740
which he owns anonymously under
a beneficial company.

50:41.924 --> 50:43.524
The McBay Hotel.

50:46.204 --> 50:48.164
OK. Thanks, Tosh.

51:11.884 --> 51:13.284
This you?

51:14.924 --> 51:16.363
That looks nothing like me.

51:16.364 --> 51:18.724
Did you have my daughter followed?

51:22.164 --> 51:23.563
Would you excuse me a moment?

51:23.564 --> 51:25.603
No, no, no, it's fine.
We can do this right here.

51:25.604 --> 51:27.324
Well, I would rather not.

51:37.564 --> 51:39.443
I am genuinely confused here.

51:39.444 --> 51:41.803
Why would I have your daughter followed?

51:41.804 --> 51:44.203
I'll find out who sent those images,

51:44.204 --> 51:47.364
and if they're linked to you,
you're finished.

51:49.044 --> 51:52.084
These traffickers
that you are looking for.

51:53.124 --> 51:54.764
Clearly, they're serious.

51:55.764 --> 51:56.924
So maybe I can help.

51:58.524 --> 52:02.043
You do business in this city,
you meet all sorts.

52:02.044 --> 52:03.683
And the truth is, you don't always know

52:03.684 --> 52:05.523
exactly who it is that you're
dealing with.

52:05.524 --> 52:07.283
But maybe I can make a few phone calls.

52:07.284 --> 52:08.843
To who, exactly?

52:08.844 --> 52:12.804
People... who don't always do
business strictly by the book.

52:13.804 --> 52:16.443
See if we can find out who it is
that's trying to send you a message.

52:16.444 --> 52:18.163
Oh, so that's what this is,
it's a message?

52:18.164 --> 52:21.443
It's not in a bottle,
but it's clearly a message.

52:21.444 --> 52:24.563
Though why anybody would be
intimidated by you,

52:24.564 --> 52:25.843
I just don't know.

52:25.844 --> 52:27.963
But I'm willing to do what I can to help.

52:27.964 --> 52:29.683
That's right, I keep forgetting,

52:29.684 --> 52:31.723
you're one of the good guys, aren't you?

52:31.724 --> 52:34.980
Well, it's an offer. Take it or leave it.

52:36.284 --> 52:39.243
See, if anybody comes anywhere near
my daughter again,

52:39.244 --> 52:42.340
I'll take the eyes right
out of your fuckin' head.

52:50.484 --> 52:51.843
Sandy.

52:51.844 --> 52:53.883
Zezi wasn't on the boat.

52:53.884 --> 52:56.243
Not according to Morag Dunwoody.

52:56.244 --> 52:57.483
You spoke to her?

52:57.484 --> 52:59.203
I've just come from there.

52:59.204 --> 53:00.844
Calum only took the men.

53:02.164 --> 53:03.964
Zezi never left Shetland.

53:05.804 --> 53:07.684
I'm on the next flight home.

53:16.724 --> 53:19.643
I know, but if Jimmy thinks
it's for the best, Cass,

53:19.644 --> 53:20.883
you should probably listen.

53:20.884 --> 53:23.803
Yeah, well, he isn't the one
missing classes.

53:23.804 --> 53:26.003
He wouldn't do it if he wasn't worried.

53:26.004 --> 53:27.563
Worried about what?

53:27.564 --> 53:29.803
I don't know what I've got to do
with this anyway.

53:29.804 --> 53:31.764
I didn't even know the Hayes.

53:32.844 --> 53:34.123
Look at the bright side,

53:34.124 --> 53:36.060
at least you'll get to spend
more time with me.

53:36.964 --> 53:39.723
You should've told me about you and Mary.

53:39.724 --> 53:43.684
Yeah... I didnae want to distract you.

53:45.204 --> 53:47.724
Or sink any lower in your estimation.

53:49.044 --> 53:50.244
You haven't.

53:51.284 --> 53:53.603
Well, let's face it, years of lying

53:53.604 --> 53:55.940
and thinking I can have my cake
and eat it didn't help.

53:59.484 --> 54:01.764
Listen, I'll just
clear my stuff out of your room.

54:29.124 --> 54:31.180
You try anything like that again

54:32.044 --> 54:33.684
and I'll kill you.

54:35.924 --> 54:37.284
You listening?

54:48.964 --> 54:50.843
Sorry about earlier,

54:50.844 --> 54:52.483
I was having a shit day.

54:52.484 --> 54:53.924
Me too...

54:55.164 --> 54:56.444
...but it just got better.
