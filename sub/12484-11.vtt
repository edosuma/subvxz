00:07.000 --> 00:09.800
I can't believe the heating and
cooling system is broken again.

00:09.830 --> 00:12.000
The air-conditioning is so
cold my buns are freezing.

00:13.910 --> 00:15.910
Two hours of baking for nothing.

00:17.940 --> 00:21.810
It's ridiculous. Every part of the
school has a different climate.

00:21.850 --> 00:24.110
The cafeteria's humid, the gym is windy.

00:24.150 --> 00:28.950
I know. Yesterday in biology, it was
so foggy I dissected my own hand.

00:33.020 --> 00:35.960
Oh! See?
It's boiling in here.

00:35.990 --> 00:39.860
Hey, guys! I'd invite you in, but
there's no lifeguard on duty.

00:41.870 --> 00:43.420
Fletcher, you left the door open!

00:43.510 --> 00:44.320
So what?

00:44.370 --> 00:47.140
So? When a cold front and a
warm front meet, it creates...

00:55.080 --> 00:57.050
It creates what?
Don't leave me hanging.

01:54.170 --> 01:57.840
Whoa! The hallway's
covered in snow!

01:57.880 --> 01:59.910
We should make a snow angel!

01:59.940 --> 02:01.080
Huh?

02:01.110 --> 02:02.210
But then a snowman would have to die.

02:05.980 --> 02:09.090
Come on, we have to ask Principal
Skidmore to do something about this.

02:09.120 --> 02:11.990
Are you crazy?
She'll bite our heads off.

02:12.020 --> 02:15.730
No, she won't.
She's a reasonable person.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.860
Let's go, you lazy wolf!
Put your back into it!

02:21.130 --> 02:25.070
See? This is the best mood
I've seen her in in weeks.

02:25.100 --> 02:27.940
Good, then you go talk to her.

02:27.970 --> 02:31.070
Whoa! Hey, no shoving!
The floors are icy!

02:37.050 --> 02:38.880
Excuse me, Principal Skidmore?

02:38.920 --> 02:41.150
What?

02:41.190 --> 02:45.760
I was just wondering if
you could maybe, possibly

02:45.790 --> 02:49.130
please do something about the
heating and cooling system?

02:49.160 --> 02:52.930
Sorry, we don't have the
money in the budget.

02:52.960 --> 02:56.100
One of you crybabies complained
about not having doors

02:56.130 --> 02:59.800
on the bathroom stalls.

02:59.840 --> 03:02.770
Well, then you need to cut
something else from the budget.

03:02.810 --> 03:03.870
Back me up here, Wacky.

03:08.880 --> 03:10.010
Wacky?

03:14.820 --> 03:16.950
Fine, I'll see what I can do.

03:24.100 --> 03:26.730
It's okay.

03:26.760 --> 03:28.970
Hey, Lexi, what's the matter?

03:29.000 --> 03:30.870
I won a beauty pageant.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.770
Are those tears of joy?

03:35.810 --> 03:37.810
No, they're tears of Lexi.

03:39.110 --> 03:40.910
Joy wasn't in the pageant.

03:42.980 --> 03:45.980
Oh, no! My eyes
are getting puffy!

03:46.020 --> 03:47.880
Paisley, go get me some cucumber!

03:49.820 --> 03:51.860
If you won, why are you upset?

03:53.060 --> 03:55.190
The problem is how I won...

03:57.930 --> 04:00.830
Tell you about someone I recently helped.

04:02.030 --> 04:04.170
Does myself count?

04:05.040 --> 04:06.140
No.

04:09.110 --> 04:14.910
Well, I do volunteer work
with an old person.

04:14.950 --> 04:18.209
Really old.
Even older than you.

04:21.790 --> 04:25.860
Because nothing is more
satisfying than bringing joy

04:25.890 --> 04:29.090
to someone's wrinkled,
little, apple-doll face.

04:31.760 --> 04:36.770
I love old people and I love America!

04:40.840 --> 04:42.840
My answer won me the crown,

04:42.870 --> 04:45.880
but now the pageant judge Mrs.
Busby wants to do a profile on me

04:45.910 --> 04:47.910
and the old person I take care of.

04:47.950 --> 04:50.110
So... So I don't take
care of an old person!

04:52.020 --> 04:54.020
I don't like old people!

04:56.050 --> 04:59.120
Look, Lexi, the best way to handle a lie

04:59.160 --> 05:01.930
is to just heap another lie on top of it.

05:03.160 --> 05:06.700
It's like covering bad meat with gravy.

05:06.730 --> 05:10.930
See? No telling
what this is.

05:10.970 --> 05:13.900
So, I just need an old
person to back up my story.

05:15.040 --> 05:16.910
Well, that's not a bad idea.

05:16.940 --> 05:19.740
I've got the cucumber for your eyes.

05:19.780 --> 05:20.940
Ow!

05:25.720 --> 05:26.950
Huh.

05:26.980 --> 05:28.890
It finally stopped raining
here in the Ant Farm.

05:30.050 --> 05:33.060
Whoa, double rainbow!

05:33.090 --> 05:34.890
So intense!

05:34.930 --> 05:38.760
What does it mean?

05:38.800 --> 05:43.770
It means Principal Skidmore finally
fixed the heating and cooling system.

05:43.800 --> 05:46.700
No need to thank me.

05:46.740 --> 05:47.870
I wonder what she cut from the budget.

05:47.910 --> 05:49.770
Skidmore fired me!

05:49.810 --> 05:52.710
What?
What?

05:52.740 --> 05:55.080
Like I said, there's no need to thank me.

05:56.080 --> 05:58.750
What happened?

05:58.780 --> 06:01.720
Skidmore said she needed to cut
unnecessary fat out of the budget.

06:01.750 --> 06:03.050
It was either me or that
weird crossing guard

06:03.090 --> 06:06.160
who always yells, "Car!
Run for your lives!"

06:09.860 --> 06:11.800
Look, don't worry, Gibson.

06:11.830 --> 06:14.030
I have no idea who's responsible for this.
No idea at all.

06:14.070 --> 06:16.800
But we'll fix it anyway.

06:16.830 --> 06:19.000
That's incredible!

06:19.040 --> 06:22.010
Don't cry. It's the least we could do
after everything you've done for us.

06:22.040 --> 06:23.840
It's not that.

06:23.870 --> 06:26.740
This double rainbow is so intense!

06:27.290 --> 06:29.320
What does it mean?

06:34.060 --> 06:35.930
Way to go, Chyna.

06:35.960 --> 06:38.900
Gibson was the only one in the
school who cared about us Ants.

06:38.930 --> 06:41.100
Believe me, I feel terrible.

06:41.140 --> 06:44.690
I mean, imagine what this place
would be like without Gibson.

06:50.850 --> 06:53.850
Wow, I do not want to live
in a world like that.

06:57.150 --> 07:00.020
If the school can't afford
to pay for Gibson's salary,

07:00.060 --> 07:01.960
we'll have to raise the money ourselves.

07:01.990 --> 07:06.730
Yeah. Okay, we just
need something simple.

07:06.760 --> 07:11.000
You know, your basic, dependable
fund-raiser that always works.

07:11.030 --> 07:13.670
Come on. Someone
toss something out there.

07:13.700 --> 07:14.100
No idea's a bad idea.

07:15.940 --> 07:17.940
How about a bake sale?
Come on, Fletcher!

07:17.970 --> 07:20.140
A bake sale!
What is wrong with you?

07:24.980 --> 07:28.880
Well, how about a webathon?

07:31.090 --> 07:33.960
That's a great idea!

07:33.990 --> 07:36.790
With your music, his art

07:36.830 --> 07:38.690
and my criminally high cheekbones,

07:38.730 --> 07:40.830
we'll raise the money in no time.

07:40.860 --> 07:42.800
Yeah, we can do it in the cafeteria.

07:42.830 --> 07:45.730
Cafeteria? Seriously,
Fletcher! Think!

07:49.100 --> 07:53.040
So, have you found an old person
to back up your story yet?

07:53.080 --> 07:55.780
Yup, a really old person.

07:55.810 --> 07:56.780
There she is.

08:01.820 --> 08:04.220
Hi, Miss Skidmore.
How are you doing today?

08:05.790 --> 08:06.990
Not good.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.160
Sorry I asked.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.030
Here's a blanket.

08:11.060 --> 08:12.990
What is this for?

08:13.030 --> 08:15.830
Well, I don't want you to get a chill.

08:15.860 --> 08:20.670
Now do you need me to go to the store and
get you some cat food and a shower chair?

08:20.700 --> 08:22.670
Lexi, what are you doing?

08:22.700 --> 08:24.710
Taking care of an old person.

08:24.740 --> 08:28.010
I want to make your last two or three
years as comfortable as possible.

08:29.810 --> 08:33.010
I am not old!
Get away from me!

08:33.049 --> 08:35.880
But if you're going to the store,
I do need some cat food.

08:36.919 --> 08:39.049
Oh! And a shower chair.

08:41.990 --> 08:44.790
Great. What am I
going to do now?

08:44.830 --> 08:47.730
If I find you an old
person to take care of,

08:47.760 --> 08:48.830
will you do something for me?

08:48.860 --> 08:50.830
Like what?

08:50.870 --> 08:53.970
I want the phone numbers of all the
losing contestants from your pageant.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.740
Not quite pretty enough
with low self esteem?

08:56.770 --> 08:58.010
My kind of girl.

09:05.010 --> 09:08.880
Welcome to the Save Gibson webathon!

09:08.920 --> 09:14.020
With special guest stars Olive
Doyle, Fletcher Quimby,

09:14.060 --> 09:15.960
Wacky the Wolf,

09:15.990 --> 09:20.860
and me, your host, Chyna Parks.

09:22.800 --> 09:26.000
Behind us, we have an array of strange,

09:26.030 --> 09:28.670
cell phone-like
objects.

09:28.700 --> 09:32.870
They are called
"landlines."

09:32.910 --> 09:35.080
Simply call the number on your screen

09:35.110 --> 09:40.720
and donate money to help
this poor, loveable man-boy.

09:40.750 --> 09:42.980
Any pledge helps.
We'll even take food.

09:43.020 --> 09:46.820
Because somebody forgot to bring snacks.

09:46.860 --> 09:48.860
That was you. Why are you
calling yourself "somebody?"

09:50.830 --> 09:52.130
I don't like to point fingers.

09:55.730 --> 09:57.730
To kick off this
web-a-thon,

09:57.770 --> 10:00.700
I'm going to play Gibson's
favorite song, "Old MacDon"

10:00.740 --> 10:05.870
on his favorite instrument,
the water glasses.

10:13.750 --> 10:16.050
Great. You guys
just drank "E-I-E-I-O."

10:20.060 --> 10:23.890
And now, acclaimed mentalist, Olive Doyle,

10:23.930 --> 10:27.090
will regale us with some
Gibson quotes she remembers.

10:27.130 --> 10:30.160
Which is everything I've ever heard
him say since the day we met.

10:31.930 --> 10:33.870
Olive, I don't know
if you want to do every...

10:33.900 --> 10:37.810
"Welcome to the Ant Farm.

10:37.840 --> 10:40.780
"I'm Gibson.
What's your name?

10:40.810 --> 10:44.780
"Olive! Aah! Stay away!
I'm allergic to olives."

10:47.980 --> 10:49.950
Hey there, dollface.

10:49.990 --> 10:52.720
Nice gams.

10:52.750 --> 10:55.690
Ew! Get away from me,
you creep!

10:55.720 --> 10:57.990
Lexi, it's me, Cameron!

10:58.030 --> 11:01.760
I know!

11:01.800 --> 11:03.930
Don't you get it?
I'm going to be your old person.

11:03.970 --> 11:05.970
Oh. Not bad!

11:06.000 --> 11:07.100
You think anyone will buy it?

11:08.870 --> 11:12.770
Lexi, you found an old person!

11:12.810 --> 11:14.840
Paisley, it's me, Cameron.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.850
Amazing!

11:18.880 --> 11:22.780
It's you as an old person.
And you've traveled here from the future.

11:22.820 --> 11:23.990
Paisley, that's...

11:24.020 --> 11:25.890
Absolutely true.

11:27.890 --> 11:30.690
I came to warn you.
In the future,

11:30.730 --> 11:35.030
Earth will be invaded and mankind
enslaved by an alien race of...

11:35.060 --> 11:38.000
Sour nummy bears!

11:38.030 --> 11:41.070
Are they upset because we've
been eating their children?

11:42.800 --> 11:43.740
Yes.

11:45.840 --> 11:49.810
The only way to save mankind is
for you to go to prom with me.

11:51.110 --> 11:53.910
Oh, well. The humans
had a good run.

11:56.720 --> 11:58.850
"Olive, whose llama is this?

11:58.890 --> 12:00.990
"Oh, yeah, it's mine.

12:01.020 --> 12:02.920
"Ow.

12:02.960 --> 12:05.760
"Bad llama!"

12:05.790 --> 12:07.660
Does this llama bite look infected?

12:09.800 --> 12:11.970
Anyway, I'm just here to pack up my things.

12:17.840 --> 12:19.940
Hey! What are
you guys doing?

12:19.980 --> 12:23.780
Well, we're trying to raise
money with a webathon.

12:23.810 --> 12:26.710
That is so sweet.
A webathon!

12:26.750 --> 12:28.880
How many spiders have you found homes for?

12:30.890 --> 12:32.790
No, we're trying to save your job.

12:32.820 --> 12:35.990
But the only person who
called was Fletcher's mom.

12:36.020 --> 12:38.960
Hey, you've got to
turn that frown upside down.

12:38.990 --> 12:40.090
Like so.

12:42.030 --> 12:43.900
See?
Now it's a smile!

12:51.010 --> 12:53.970
I wish there were an easier way
to turn your frown upside down.

12:58.010 --> 13:00.880
Hello?

13:00.920 --> 13:03.950
<i>Whatever that</i> <i>poor man has, I want
to</i> <i>give money to find a cure.</i>

13:04.890 --> 13:05.950
What?

13:10.030 --> 13:14.660
Oh... Yes, it is tragic.

13:14.940 --> 13:17.950
But, together, we can conquer...

13:18.940 --> 13:20.790
Gibson fever!

13:22.490 --> 13:25.070
Won't you please call in and help?

13:34.960 --> 13:37.060
So, Mrs. Busby,
this is where

13:37.090 --> 13:39.930
I spend most of my afternoons and weekends,

13:39.960 --> 13:43.030
taking care of
dear, old Mr. Parks.

13:43.060 --> 13:45.270
Well, you know what I always say.

13:45.300 --> 13:48.000
The true beauty queen

13:48.040 --> 13:50.970
is as beautiful on the inside

13:51.010 --> 13:53.940
as she is on the outside.

13:53.980 --> 13:56.140
That's why I had a spleen job.

13:58.950 --> 14:01.180
Mr. Parks, I'm here!

14:01.220 --> 14:05.120
Hello, Lexi, my little angel.

14:05.150 --> 14:09.190
And who's this lovely, young
whippersnapper you've brought with you?

14:09.220 --> 14:10.920
Oh, you.

14:12.890 --> 14:15.160
This is Mrs. Busby.
Mmm.

14:15.200 --> 14:17.970
Nice to meet you,
Mr. Parks.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.070
Have you always lived in San Francisco?

14:20.100 --> 14:22.170
Oh, yes, indeedy.

14:22.200 --> 14:27.870
I lived here before they finished
building the Golden Gate Bridge in 1937.

14:27.910 --> 14:32.250
I can still hear the sounds of all
1.2 million rivets being put in.

14:32.280 --> 14:34.980
Wow, you can remember that?

14:35.020 --> 14:37.150
Like I read it in a book this afternoon!

14:40.050 --> 14:42.890
Back then I had to swim across the bay

14:42.920 --> 14:44.260
just to buy my penny candy.

14:45.190 --> 14:47.090
Really?

14:47.130 --> 14:49.230
I thought they had a ferry
to take people across.

14:49.260 --> 14:52.000
Oh! That's just a myth.

14:52.030 --> 14:54.270
How could a fairy,
a tiny wing-ed creature,

14:54.300 --> 14:57.140
carry a man across the bay?

14:58.210 --> 15:00.270
Good point!

15:00.310 --> 15:03.910
Ooh, well, now, who is this young man?

15:03.950 --> 15:06.850
Uh... That's my grandson,
Cameron.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.850
Oh, really?

15:09.880 --> 15:12.920
Well, I thought Lexi said that she

15:12.950 --> 15:15.920
helped you because
you didn't have any family.

15:15.960 --> 15:18.990
Cameron doesn't hp because he lives...

15:19.030 --> 15:21.060
In his own world!

15:21.100 --> 15:23.060
Don't expect any of my inheritance,

15:23.100 --> 15:25.100
you good-for-nothing
rapscallion!

15:26.200 --> 15:27.900
Oh, so, he's here?

15:30.040 --> 15:31.840
Well, maybe I can set him straight.

15:31.870 --> 15:33.170
I'm very good with teens.

15:33.210 --> 15:34.240
I have three of my own.

15:36.940 --> 15:38.950
This would be the time when you say,

15:38.980 --> 15:41.180
"Why you're way too
young to have teenagers!"

15:42.920 --> 15:44.990
Say it!

15:45.020 --> 15:46.820
Uh...

15:46.850 --> 15:49.820
But you're way too young to have teenagers.

15:49.860 --> 15:50.990
Oh, thank you,
Mr. Parks.

15:53.960 --> 15:56.030
Okay, well, go get
what's-his-name.

15:56.060 --> 15:58.170
Cameron.

15:58.200 --> 15:59.900
You heard her,
Mr. Parks.

15:59.930 --> 16:01.230
Why don't you go get your grandson?

16:01.270 --> 16:03.140
But...
Get him!

16:03.170 --> 16:04.300
Right. Right.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.010
Oh!

16:12.050 --> 16:13.010
See how I'm helping?

16:13.050 --> 16:14.050
I got it.

16:17.950 --> 16:20.820
A lot of people don't know
about Gibson Fever,

16:20.860 --> 16:24.020
so to shed some light
on this tragic affliction,

16:24.060 --> 16:28.230
we have invited world renowned expert Dr.
Ima Fraud.

16:31.200 --> 16:34.170
It's pronounced "Ima Fraud."

16:37.910 --> 16:40.070
If you take a look
at this X-ray,

16:40.110 --> 16:44.810
you will find that
this is in fact not hair,

16:44.850 --> 16:47.310
but the brain being rejected by the body!

16:50.080 --> 16:51.990
So sad!

16:52.020 --> 16:56.090
So, won't you please open up your hearts

16:56.120 --> 17:00.160
and pocket books to help this
poor, misshapen monster?

17:07.030 --> 17:09.000
Why aren't more people calling?

17:09.040 --> 17:11.770
We're never going to save
Gibson's job at this rate.

17:11.810 --> 17:14.040
Maybe they aren't worried
about Gibson Fever.

17:14.079 --> 17:15.780
Because it's a fake disease?

17:15.810 --> 17:17.210
No, because it only affects one person.

17:20.849 --> 17:23.050
Unless it's contagious.

17:24.190 --> 17:26.150
Chyna, this idea is crazy.

17:29.020 --> 17:31.090
Hey! What do you
want from me?

17:31.130 --> 17:33.190
I'm suffering from Gibson Fever.

17:33.230 --> 17:34.930
Licorice?

17:36.830 --> 17:38.930
I don't know if anybody's
going to believe this,

17:38.970 --> 17:40.830
but maybe they'll find it
funny and donate anyway.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.170
'Cause, I mean, you guys look ridiculous.

17:50.880 --> 17:52.850
Mr. Parks, have you
found Cameron yet?

17:52.880 --> 17:54.110
I'm working on it.

17:54.150 --> 17:56.120
Now, Cameron, you get down there

17:56.150 --> 17:58.120
and talk to that beautiful young lady.

17:59.090 --> 18:01.150
Aw, thank you.

18:04.130 --> 18:05.860
You wanted to see me?

18:08.100 --> 18:09.730
You have a little something...

18:12.870 --> 18:14.900
Something wrong?

18:14.940 --> 18:18.740
I'm just upset about how things
are between me and Grandpa.

18:18.770 --> 18:21.940
Oh, well, In that case,

18:21.980 --> 18:24.910
I think we should get
your grandpa down here

18:24.950 --> 18:28.080
so that you can work
things out face to face.

18:28.120 --> 18:31.790
Uh... I guess I'll go see
if I can find him.

18:33.960 --> 18:35.260
I think I just did.

18:37.830 --> 18:42.060
Young man, you are, as my
teenage boys would say,

18:42.100 --> 18:43.260
a butt-head.

18:45.100 --> 18:47.030
Oh, hi, Grandpa!

18:49.140 --> 18:51.970
I can explain.

18:52.010 --> 18:55.140
No need. I know exactly
what's going on here.

18:55.180 --> 18:57.910
You lied!

18:57.950 --> 19:02.850
So, I'm going to strip you of your crown.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.990
Oh, Mommy missed you so much!

19:07.790 --> 19:09.090
Ooh!

19:18.970 --> 19:21.100
And for a pledge of $80,

19:21.140 --> 19:25.010
you will receive this CD
of Gibson's Greatest hits.

19:27.780 --> 19:30.080
It includes such classics as.

19:30.110 --> 19:34.780
"Welcome to the Ant Farm!"

19:34.820 --> 19:37.850
And "Does This Llama Bite
Look Infected?"

19:39.790 --> 19:43.090
I'm back. I left some
important bills in my desk.

19:45.060 --> 19:47.130
This one's from a northern pintail duck.

19:49.800 --> 19:55.770
Hey, why does everyone look so handsome?

19:55.800 --> 19:59.010
Guys, we have a caller who
wants to make a huge donation!

19:59.040 --> 20:00.110
Ooh!

20:01.810 --> 20:03.110
You're on the air.

20:03.140 --> 20:06.180
<i>I think I've come down</i>
<i>with a case of Gibson Fever.</i>

20:07.950 --> 20:08.980
You have?

20:10.080 --> 20:11.950
Gibson Fever?

20:11.990 --> 20:14.920
Yes. I'm sure of it.

20:14.960 --> 20:18.930
Suddenly, I have a striped
shirt, curly hair,

20:18.960 --> 20:22.900
and the inability to understand
that I have been fired.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.030
I think I might have that!

20:32.010 --> 20:34.940
So, how much are you donating?

20:38.050 --> 20:43.050
Nothing. This webathon
is a complete sham.

20:43.080 --> 20:45.050
You can't tell people the
money's for one thing

20:45.090 --> 20:47.190
and then use it for something else.

20:47.220 --> 20:50.220
Didn't you use PTA money for an eye lift?

20:51.960 --> 20:53.290
I had crow's feet!

20:54.930 --> 20:57.900
You collect crow's feet, too?

20:57.930 --> 21:00.200
This one's from an eastern hooded crow.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.840
Kids, return the money.
Gibson, gather your things and go.

21:07.840 --> 21:09.740
Wow.

21:09.780 --> 21:12.250
I can't imagine not being
here at the Ant Farm.

21:17.790 --> 21:19.220
See?
I can't imagine it.

21:21.020 --> 21:23.090
Well, thanks for trying, guys.

21:23.120 --> 21:24.860
I'll miss you.

21:26.790 --> 21:27.860
Wait.

21:29.960 --> 21:31.130
If that Gibson's leaving,

21:34.170 --> 21:36.200
then this Gibson's leaving, too.

21:37.890 --> 21:38.990
What?

21:39.290 --> 21:41.860
If he's fired, then I'm quitting the A.
N.T. Program.

21:42.710 --> 21:44.630
So is this Gibson.

21:46.450 --> 21:48.160
So is this Gibson.

21:52.150 --> 21:54.630
Oh... So is that Gibson.

21:56.480 --> 21:57.700
Ok, Ok...

21:57.900 --> 22:00.350
I'll find the money somehow.

22:00.350 --> 22:01.750
Gibson, you can stay.

22:03.070 --> 22:04.070
Yeah!

22:04.070 --> 22:05.430
You guys are the best!

22:05.430 --> 22:08.780
Hey! Let's all jump and freeze in
the air like they do in a movie.

22:10.900 --> 22:11.610
What?

22:19.200 --> 22:21.800
No no no. Please don't call.

22:22.180 --> 22:24.610
There's nothing we can do to help him.

22:28.760 --> 22:30.710
Wow. He actually did it.

22:30.910 --> 22:32.110
