You do not die!

44:11.126 --> 44:14.390
Why you got to be so rough?

UHURA:
Lt. Spock, we're being hailed
by the Klingon captain.

44:22.094 --> 44:23.791
CAPTAIN D'CHOK:
What is the meaning of this?

44:23.835 --> 44:25.488
Hiding?

44:25.532 --> 44:27.360
Trespassing?

44:27.403 --> 44:30.929
Destroying your own ship
in order to cover your tracks?

44:30.972 --> 44:33.061
We were in fact
pursuing a rogue vessel

44:33.105 --> 44:35.890
-which intended to do you harm.
-Absurd.

44:35.934 --> 44:37.849
Why else would I tell you
the ship was not ours

44:37.892 --> 44:39.589
if it was indeed ours?

44:39.633 --> 44:41.200
To cover your own failure

44:41.243 --> 44:44.333
in the face
of our superior might.

44:45.944 --> 44:47.423
But we destroyed the ship.

44:47.467 --> 44:49.077
You anticipated defeat.

44:49.121 --> 44:51.036
And now you're stalling
for another day.

44:51.079 --> 44:53.516
Captain, your sensors
did not detect us

44:53.560 --> 44:55.605
until we fired on
the false Federation vessel.

44:55.649 --> 44:57.999
Could we not have as easily
fired on yours?

44:58.043 --> 44:59.784
But why should I trust you?

44:59.827 --> 45:01.307
SPOCK:
I am Vulcan.

45:01.350 --> 45:02.743
And as I believe
your people know,

45:02.787 --> 45:04.223
Vulcans cannot lie.

45:04.266 --> 45:07.313
I care little
for what legends say.

45:07.356 --> 45:09.750
I know a man's truth

45:09.794 --> 45:12.100
only when I look into his eyes,

45:12.144 --> 45:14.581
face-to-face.

45:14.624 --> 45:16.670
So be it.

45:16.714 --> 45:18.541
Perhaps we can
conclude this discussion

45:18.585 --> 45:20.108
over a barrel of bloodwine?

45:21.457 --> 45:23.416
You drink bloodwine?

45:23.459 --> 45:24.896
I have been known to.

45:26.767 --> 45:30.075
This is something I must see.

45:31.511 --> 45:33.731
You're no typical Vulcan.

45:34.732 --> 45:36.559
No.

45:36.603 --> 45:38.648
It would seem I am not.

45:39.737 --> 45:42.130

46:05.545 --> 46:07.503
Well, uh, listen,
I think my Klingon

46:07.547 --> 46:09.244
might be a little rusty,

46:09.288 --> 46:13.074
but did he just say
"may your blood scream?"

46:13.118 --> 46:15.816
A Klingon toast,
the true meaning of which

46:15.860 --> 46:17.165
is becoming clear to me.

46:17.209 --> 46:19.428
Right.
[clears throat]

46:19.472 --> 46:21.082
Well, thank you

46:21.126 --> 46:23.781
for getting me
out of the Academy.

46:25.043 --> 46:27.523
Are you actually Lanthanite?

46:27.567 --> 46:29.830
Oh, a couple of drinks

46:29.874 --> 46:31.484
and you get personal--

46:31.527 --> 46:33.051
that it, flyboy?

46:34.356 --> 46:37.272
I am.

46:37.316 --> 46:39.884
I have always been
fascinated by your people.

46:39.927 --> 46:43.017
That you managed to live
on Earth among other humans

46:43.061 --> 46:45.846
undetected until
the 22nd century is remarkable.

46:45.890 --> 46:49.589
You know your mother was one of
the first people I came out to.

46:49.632 --> 46:51.417
I did not.

46:51.460 --> 46:54.550
But that's a tale
for another time.

46:55.987 --> 46:58.816
And now you teach engineering
at Starfleet Academy?

46:58.859 --> 47:00.382
Taught.

47:01.819 --> 47:04.822
You asked me why I helped you.

47:05.910 --> 47:07.737
You want to know the worst thing

47:07.781 --> 47:12.699
about living almost forever?

47:12.742 --> 47:14.657
The loss of those you love.

47:14.701 --> 47:16.703
Oh, you sweet

47:16.746 --> 47:18.966
un-Vulcan Vulcan.

47:19.010 --> 47:20.968
No.

47:21.012 --> 47:23.492
That's a pain shared

47:23.536 --> 47:26.017
by all those who live

47:26.060 --> 47:28.628
with even a half-open heart.

47:28.671 --> 47:30.586
No.

47:31.587 --> 47:33.851
It's boredom.

47:33.894 --> 47:36.331
And on that ship of yours,

47:36.375 --> 47:38.594
there seems to be
a shortage of that.

47:38.638 --> 47:40.683
I like it.

47:40.727 --> 47:44.035
-Hm.
-I might even
try and stick around.

47:44.078 --> 47:45.601
Huh?

Huh?

Another?

47:54.741 --> 47:56.264
Please.

48:17.895 --> 48:19.461

After explicitly
ordering you not to go,

48:34.737 --> 48:36.217
you risked hundreds of lives,

48:36.261 --> 48:37.784

peace in the quadrant.

of your voice, Admiral.

48:39.960 --> 48:42.006
Oh, my God.

Are you hungover, Spock?

The result of a peace treaty
with the Klingon captain.

48:46.227 --> 48:48.751
-After a successful mission.
-You got lucky,

48:48.795 --> 48:50.710

as easily gone the other way,

a brutal war with the Klingons.

48:55.367 --> 48:57.978
followed my gut, as you humans
are so fond of saying,

48:58.022 --> 48:59.501
and I will accept

48:59.545 --> 49:01.939
whatever punishment
Starfleet feels is just.

Consider that Klingon hangover
your punishment.

be a next time--
