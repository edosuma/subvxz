02:19.663 --> 02:21.132
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

02:21.166 --> 02:22.934
Good evening.

02:22.967 --> 02:26.171
It's good to be back with
you all here in Wichita Falls.

02:26.204 --> 02:28.173
My name is
Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd,

02:28.206 --> 02:30.375
and I'm here tonight
to bring y'all the news

02:30.408 --> 02:33.044
from across
this great world of ours.

02:33.078 --> 02:35.213
Now...

02:35.246 --> 02:36.981
Pleasure.

02:37.015 --> 02:39.017
Now, I know how life is
in these parts,

02:39.050 --> 02:40.818
working a trade
sunup to sundown.

02:40.851 --> 02:43.088
No time for reading newspapers.
Am I correct?

02:44.923 --> 02:46.690
Let me do that work for you.

02:46.723 --> 02:49.693
And maybe, just for tonight,

02:49.726 --> 02:52.830
we can escape our troubles

02:52.863 --> 02:55.899
and hear of the great changes
that are happening out there.

02:59.137 --> 03:00.671
Starting local, then.

03:00.704 --> 03:03.707
Our own <i>Houston Telegraph</i>

03:03.740 --> 03:08.079
from the first of February,
this news:

03:08.113 --> 03:10.215
"The meningitis epidemic

03:10.248 --> 03:12.850
"continues to spread
without prejudice

03:12.883 --> 03:16.720
"across the Panhandle
and North Texas region.

03:16.753 --> 03:19.923
"So far, it has claimed

03:19.957 --> 03:22.092
"97 souls...

03:22.127 --> 03:24.628

03:25.463 --> 03:28.999
<i>In federal news,

03:29.032 --> 03:31.068

03:59.796 --> 04:01.865
- Here.
- Much obliged.

05:49.239 --> 05:50.773
Hey.

05:53.143 --> 05:54.378
Hey!

05:57.281 --> 05:58.881
Hey!

05:58.914 --> 05:59.982
Stop!

06:02.252 --> 06:04.854
I'm not gonna hurt you.

06:06.956 --> 06:09.293
Come here.

06:12.162 --> 06:14.930
Aah! Don't bite!

06:26.208 --> 06:28.245
Who are you?

06:31.481 --> 06:33.849
Do you have a name?

06:49.198 --> 06:52.034
I don't understand.

06:52.068 --> 06:53.437
I...

06:53.470 --> 06:56.005
I don't speak Kiowa.

06:57.006 --> 06:58.841
Come.

07:00.309 --> 07:01.844
Come on.

07:03.379 --> 07:06.115
It's all right. It's all right.

07:07.450 --> 07:09.251
Come on.

07:10.252 --> 07:12.888
You can't stay out here. You...

07:12.922 --> 07:14.924
Give me your hand.

07:38.013 --> 07:41.917
Mm. These are
Indian agency papers.

07:41.951 --> 07:44.353
"Johanna Leonberger."

07:45.421 --> 07:47.256
Is that your name?

07:47.289 --> 07:49.225
Johanna?

07:54.230 --> 07:56.932
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

08:13.549 --> 08:15.317
Let's see what we got here.

08:17.153 --> 08:18.320
Gonna check it on that side.

08:18.354 --> 08:19.922
Got your loyalty oath?

08:23.092 --> 08:24.560
No, nothing.

08:24.593 --> 08:26.429
Where'd you serve, Captain?

08:26.462 --> 08:28.564
Third Texas Infantry.

08:28.597 --> 08:32.101
Surrendered Galveston
26 May, 1865.

08:32.134 --> 08:33.369
Any sidearms?

08:33.402 --> 08:34.470
No, sir.

08:36.205 --> 08:38.140
Just bird shot.

08:38.174 --> 08:40.075
Says here
you're from San Antonio.

08:40.109 --> 08:42.111
What's your business up here?

08:42.144 --> 08:45.147
I read the news
from town to town.

08:45.181 --> 08:47.149
I was headed down
to the Red River,

08:47.183 --> 08:49.418
and-and I seen him.

08:49.452 --> 08:52.388
I think he was transporting
this little girl here

08:52.421 --> 08:54.523
for the federal authorities.

08:57.226 --> 09:00.094
Looks like the Indians had her.

09:01.330 --> 09:03.432
Here's her agency papers.

09:03.466 --> 09:05.099
Just found them.

09:07.269 --> 09:09.371
Let's saddle up.

09:20.081 --> 09:21.317
You're good.

09:21.350 --> 09:24.018
What the hell do I do
with this child?

09:24.052 --> 09:25.521
Fetch her to Red River.
Command post will know.

09:25.554 --> 09:27.490
- Hyah!
- Hyah.

09:27.523 --> 09:29.391
Hyah!

09:56.652 --> 09:59.822
So, the army found you
three weeks ago

09:59.855 --> 10:03.291
when they cleared the Kiowa
out of Montague County.

10:03.324 --> 10:06.227
You've been living with them
since they kidnapped you

10:06.261 --> 10:08.396
when they attacked your family
in Hill Country

10:08.429 --> 10:10.465
six years prior.

10:12.166 --> 10:13.636
Dear Heaven.

10:17.605 --> 10:20.575
"Her mother, father
and sister were..."

10:23.444 --> 10:25.179
Well, they passed.

10:25.213 --> 10:28.383
But you have an aunt
and an uncle...

10:30.285 --> 10:32.353
...still living down there.

10:33.354 --> 10:35.323
Near Castroville.

10:37.325 --> 10:39.327
So, that's where
you were being taken.

10:42.163 --> 10:45.099
I know Castroville.

10:45.133 --> 10:48.202
I used to live near there
before the war.

10:54.576 --> 10:57.345
Lot of German folk down there.

10:58.713 --> 11:00.615
Yeah.

11:02.350 --> 11:03.618
Yeah.

11:12.393 --> 11:15.430
Uh, remember
your German family?

11:15.463 --> 11:16.598
Uh...

11:16.631 --> 11:18.433
All right.

11:21.369 --> 11:26.140
Come tomorrow, we'll find
somebody who can take you home.

12:18.459 --> 12:20.528
All right, me, too.

12:20.561 --> 12:22.262
Come on. Ah, ah.

12:22.295 --> 12:24.499
Come on. Come on.

12:25.700 --> 12:27.367
Pardon me.

12:27.402 --> 12:29.404
Lost child here.

12:29.437 --> 12:31.539
Got a child issue here.

12:32.840 --> 12:34.542
Much obliged. Bless you, sir.

12:34.575 --> 12:36.209
- I got a lost... lost child.
- I can't use this.

12:36.243 --> 12:37.411
That's all I can do for now.

12:37.444 --> 12:38.479
Thank you.

12:45.787 --> 12:46.988
What's your business?

12:47.021 --> 12:50.290
Here to see your Indian agent.

12:50.323 --> 12:51.993
He's up north of the Red,

12:52.026 --> 12:53.761
on the reservation.

12:53.795 --> 12:57.264
Well, I found this child, see,

12:57.297 --> 12:59.734
and the lieutenant
who was patrolling the road

12:59.767 --> 13:01.803
told me to bring her
to see you.

13:04.604 --> 13:06.406
Well, what do you
expect me to do?

13:06.440 --> 13:07.809
She needs taken home.

13:07.842 --> 13:09.443
The agent won't be back

13:09.476 --> 13:10.812
for another three months.

13:10.845 --> 13:12.780
Strays are his responsibility.

13:12.814 --> 13:15.315
Looks like
you'll need to take her.

13:15.348 --> 13:16.718
I-I can't take her, sir.

13:16.751 --> 13:19.653
I work and travel
from town to town.

13:19.686 --> 13:21.521
I can't take her.

13:21.555 --> 13:23.557
Listen, friend.

13:23.590 --> 13:25.592
Wait for the agent
or take her yourself.

13:25.625 --> 13:27.494
It's up to you.

13:29.696 --> 13:32.499
If you will, please.

13:35.368 --> 13:37.404
Next.

14:14.374 --> 14:16.077
Good to lay eyes on you,
Captain.

14:16.110 --> 14:17.577
Hello, son.

14:18.678 --> 14:20.714
Wonder if I could have
a word with you

14:20.747 --> 14:22.282
and Mrs. Boudlin.

14:22.916 --> 14:24.818
Well, of course, sir.

14:26.887 --> 14:29.389
<i>So, three months, huh?</i>

14:29.422 --> 14:30.824
What are you going
to do with her?

14:30.857 --> 14:33.660
Wait for the agent, it appears.

14:46.606 --> 14:49.409
Got kind of a wild look
about her, doesn't she?

14:49.442 --> 14:51.511
No, she's scared.

14:52.546 --> 14:54.681
Hmm.

14:54.714 --> 14:57.484
Be careful, honey.

14:57.517 --> 14:59.653
Don't get too close.

15:03.790 --> 15:06.459
All right, now, see here,
child. I have to work.

15:06.493 --> 15:09.763
You're gonna stay here
with these kind folks.

15:10.931 --> 15:13.700
Friends. Friends.

15:13.733 --> 15:16.436
You got that, child?

15:17.571 --> 15:19.539
Well, shoot, Kidd.

15:19.573 --> 15:22.475
She don't understand
a damn thing, does she?

15:24.878 --> 15:26.880
Thank you kindly.

15:33.587 --> 15:35.421
<i>All right, let's start</i>

15:35.454 --> 15:37.724
<i>with the local news
from</i> The Carthage Banner.

15:37.757 --> 15:40.459
"The Red River Ferry is sunk

15:40.492 --> 15:42.629
"near Cross Timbers.

15:42.662 --> 15:45.799
"Waters are still
too high to cross,

15:45.832 --> 15:50.170
and parts down to Elm Creek
are completely washed out."

15:51.872 --> 15:54.875
Yanks sending soldiers
too blue to muddy their boots.

15:54.908 --> 15:58.678
That's why.

15:58.712 --> 16:00.446
That's right!

16:00.479 --> 16:03.549
Well, now, <i>The Clifton Record</i>

16:03.582 --> 16:06.518
is reporting big changes
that are coming to these parts

16:06.552 --> 16:09.688
that'll have a bearing
on all of these travel issues.

16:09.723 --> 16:11.758
On page one:

16:11.791 --> 16:15.962
"The Pacific Railroad Committee
voted today

16:15.996 --> 16:18.631
"the Missouri, Fort Scott
and Gulf lines

16:18.664 --> 16:21.034
"are to be consolidated
into a new line

16:21.067 --> 16:23.203
"that will run
from the Kansas border

16:23.236 --> 16:26.438
all the way
to Galveston, Texas."

16:30.809 --> 16:33.646
"This will be
the first railroad

16:33.679 --> 16:35.781
to cross
the Indian reservation."

16:42.688 --> 16:45.959
Now, for some federal news.

16:50.829 --> 16:52.731
"President Ulysses S. Grant..."

16:52.765 --> 16:53.899
Oh, to hell with Grant!

16:53.933 --> 16:55.534
Grant's a butcher!

16:55.567 --> 16:56.769
"...has ordered..."

16:58.071 --> 17:00.572
"...has ordered
the Texas legislature

17:00.606 --> 17:03.943
"to accept
Amendments 13, 14 and 15

17:03.976 --> 17:05.911
"of the United States
Constitution

17:05.945 --> 17:09.249
"before any return to the Union
can be considered.

17:09.282 --> 17:13.619
Those Amendments include
the abolition of slavery..."

17:13.652 --> 17:15.788
Say no to abolition. Never!

17:15.821 --> 17:18.524
"...affording to
the former slaves

17:18.557 --> 17:21.827
the right to vote, and the
repayment of our war debts."

17:23.595 --> 17:25.030
I'm saying no.

17:25.064 --> 17:29.501
I say Texas first
and damn them amendments.

17:33.005 --> 17:35.040
I ain't digging no Texas soil,

17:35.074 --> 17:38.577
sweating and bleeding
for some rich Yankee type.

17:39.678 --> 17:40.980
I suggest y'all watch yourself.

17:41.013 --> 17:43.682
Suggest y'all the same!

17:44.717 --> 17:46.618
What are y'all even
doing here, huh?

17:46.652 --> 17:47.987
You ain't dealing
with the Injuns,

17:48.020 --> 17:51.523
fixing our roads,
minding our river crossings.

17:51.557 --> 17:53.993
All they're doing is
beating up on Southern folk!

17:57.629 --> 17:59.898
You know, all right.
I hear you. I hear you.

18:00.599 --> 18:02.134
Go back home where you belong.

18:02.167 --> 18:03.769
I hear you.

18:04.970 --> 18:07.673
Northern blues
are not helping us a lot,

18:07.706 --> 18:10.743
and they're asking
for a great deal in return.

18:14.046 --> 18:16.548
We're all hurting.

18:16.582 --> 18:18.117
All of us.

18:20.786 --> 18:24.890
But I'm thinking we got a part
to play in all of this as well.

18:26.925 --> 18:30.629
There's more than rain
and Indians

18:30.662 --> 18:33.699
and Northern blues
troubling our roads.

18:33.732 --> 18:37.336
I've seen it myself,
coming in from Wichita Falls.

18:37.369 --> 18:39.905
Yeah.

18:39.938 --> 18:41.940
We're all hurting.

18:44.043 --> 18:46.078
These are difficult times.

18:51.817 --> 18:54.153
- Appreciate it. Thank you.
- Thanks.

18:54.186 --> 18:55.653
Much obliged. Thank you.

18:55.686 --> 18:56.789
Thank you so much.

18:56.822 --> 18:57.923
Thank you for your attention.

18:57.956 --> 18:59.058
Excuse me.

18:59.091 --> 19:00.558
Pardon me. Pardon me.

19:02.693 --> 19:04.762
She's gone.

19:05.630 --> 19:07.732
Little one! Child!

19:07.765 --> 19:09.968
Where are you?

19:11.136 --> 19:12.938
I-I was singing her a hymn,

19:12.971 --> 19:14.873
and I turned my back,
and she was gone.

19:14.907 --> 19:16.674
She didn't take the horses.

19:16.707 --> 19:18.110
- She can't be gone far.
- Oh, she could be anywhere

19:18.143 --> 19:19.777
in this damn woods.

19:19.811 --> 19:21.746
Child?

19:21.779 --> 19:24.083
You come out now.

19:26.651 --> 19:28.187
There's a river down there.

19:28.220 --> 19:30.055
Right behind you.

19:30.089 --> 19:32.391
Little girl, where are you?

19:32.424 --> 19:34.093
Where you at?

19:34.126 --> 19:35.827
We need to split up!

19:35.860 --> 19:37.795
Yes, sir, Captain.

20:15.200 --> 20:16.801
No!

20:17.768 --> 20:20.004
Johanna, no! Johanna!

20:20.037 --> 20:21.839
It's not safe!

20:21.873 --> 20:23.708
You'll fall!

20:24.709 --> 20:25.943
Step back!

20:25.977 --> 20:28.779
Johanna!

20:28.813 --> 20:30.114
Get down!

21:07.051 --> 21:09.086
Set her on the bed.

21:11.189 --> 21:12.957
Oh.

21:15.092 --> 21:17.728
She's just soaked.

21:17.762 --> 21:19.697
Oh.

21:21.232 --> 21:23.501
Surer than I live,
that child's trouble.

21:23.534 --> 21:25.836
Running off like that?

21:29.307 --> 21:31.909
I said she's wild.
Didn't I say that?

21:31.943 --> 21:34.946
Please, Mr. Boudlin.

21:34.979 --> 21:36.948
Well, it's the goddamn truth.

21:36.981 --> 21:40.017
You-you just got to look
at her to know.

21:40.051 --> 21:42.186
Child's got a curse on her.

21:55.132 --> 21:57.101
Well, shit, Captain.

21:57.134 --> 21:59.870
What the hell are you
gonna do with her?

22:04.308 --> 22:06.843
I'll take her.

22:07.844 --> 22:09.880
I found her. I-I'll take her.

22:11.148 --> 22:13.883
You sure about that, Captain?

22:13.918 --> 22:17.255
Castroville's
damn near 400 miles.

22:17.288 --> 22:21.092
Those roads have changed
since you lived down that way.

22:22.826 --> 22:24.961
The little girl is lost.

22:26.230 --> 22:28.798
She needs to be home.

22:38.276 --> 22:40.010
Much obliged
for you keeping her.

22:40.043 --> 22:41.911
I'll be back first thing.

23:05.269 --> 23:08.905
She ain't been used in a while
but still runs pretty good.

23:21.217 --> 23:22.852
You carrying?

23:23.654 --> 23:25.121
Scattergun bird shot.

23:25.155 --> 23:27.190
I, uh...

23:27.223 --> 23:31.027
kept mine from Palmito.

23:31.061 --> 23:33.863
Well, I'm sure you need it
more than me.

23:33.897 --> 23:35.832
Got 20 rounds, too.

23:42.238 --> 23:44.341
I'll fetch it back to you.

23:44.374 --> 23:46.376
Mm, it won't make no matter.

23:56.252 --> 23:57.921
Captain.

23:59.055 --> 24:00.857
Why are you doing this?

24:03.526 --> 24:05.161
Johanna. Johanna!

24:05.195 --> 24:07.397
Come on now. Come, come.

24:10.200 --> 24:11.901
Another sleeve. There we go.

24:11.935 --> 24:13.970
There we go. Okay.

24:15.004 --> 24:16.106
There we are.

24:16.139 --> 24:18.108
Come now. Come now. Come now.

24:18.141 --> 24:19.677
There. Oh!

24:19.710 --> 24:22.078
By the grace of God,
don't you look pretty, hmm?

25:22.539 --> 25:25.909
Makes no matter to me
what you wear.

25:37.220 --> 25:39.322
We'll be on this road
for about six days

25:39.355 --> 25:40.989
till we make Dallas.

25:41.791 --> 25:44.594
Then across Central Texas
to the Hill Country,

25:44.627 --> 25:46.962
it'll be a few weeks.

25:48.231 --> 25:50.366
We'll have to stop
and give readings, of course.

25:50.400 --> 25:52.167
We have to pay our way.

25:52.201 --> 25:54.237
I'll keep an eye out
for trouble.

25:55.371 --> 25:57.373
Settlers killing Indians
for their land

25:57.407 --> 26:00.577
and Indians killing settlers
for taking it.

26:02.545 --> 26:05.280
I guess you know something
about that.

26:09.084 --> 26:12.087
I'm Captain Kidd, by the by.

26:13.356 --> 26:16.158
Captain. Captain.

26:16.191 --> 26:17.627
You're Johanna.

26:17.660 --> 26:19.294
You, Johanna.

26:25.100 --> 26:27.069
And it's a pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

26:27.102 --> 26:29.004
Make no mistake.

26:48.123 --> 26:50.526
Mm.

26:55.297 --> 26:57.132
This is the bacon.

26:57.165 --> 26:59.501
I guess I'll make some.

27:00.602 --> 27:03.372
"Please" would be nice to hear.

27:04.606 --> 27:06.608
That's the way it works.

27:07.643 --> 27:10.212
That is coffee.

27:22.324 --> 27:25.260
Yeah, coffee packs a punch,
doesn't it?

27:28.230 --> 27:30.566
It's an acquired taste.

27:35.704 --> 27:38.273
That's sugar.

27:42.544 --> 27:44.446
Hmm?

27:45.614 --> 27:47.583
Bit more to your liking, huh?

27:49.217 --> 27:50.619
Easy, now.

27:51.753 --> 27:53.689
All right, that's enough.

27:53.722 --> 27:56.291
That's enough.

27:56.325 --> 27:57.626
Hey.

28:21.550 --> 28:24.620
See all those words

28:24.653 --> 28:27.522
printed in a line
one after the other?

28:30.292 --> 28:34.196
Put 'em all together,
and you have a story.

28:39.401 --> 28:41.202
Story.

28:42.471 --> 28:44.339
Stories.

28:47.709 --> 28:50.244
Well, go right ahead.

29:03.224 --> 29:05.226
That's my wife.

29:06.528 --> 29:08.362
Down in San Antonio.

29:35.523 --> 29:38.325
I'm gonna get some more water.

31:01.542 --> 31:03.277
Come here
and help me load this up.

31:04.478 --> 31:06.547
If you wanna make your fortune,
then that's the place to be.

31:23.430 --> 31:26.100
God does not see
black and white.

31:26.133 --> 31:27.868
The divide that runs
across our nation.

31:27.902 --> 31:29.737
We must keep America whole.

31:31.138 --> 31:33.541
Texas says no,
but I say to you all,

31:33.574 --> 31:36.911
under the eyes of God,
that our nation,

31:36.944 --> 31:40.714
our great nation,
must be made complete!

31:44.852 --> 31:47.320
Mrs. Gannett.

31:48.455 --> 31:50.558
Hey, Kidd.

31:50.591 --> 31:51.859
She yours?

31:59.600 --> 32:01.569
They paying you
to take her home,

32:01.602 --> 32:03.704
or you doing it out of
the goodness of your heart?

32:03.737 --> 32:06.507
No, they're not paying me.
I just know the road.

32:06.540 --> 32:09.577
But I'll take a pair of rooms
if you have 'em.

32:09.610 --> 32:11.912
Yeah, I got rooms.

32:26.660 --> 32:27.761
Thank you.

32:28.762 --> 32:30.530
Thank you, ma'am.

32:33.533 --> 32:34.902
No. No, no, no.

32:34.935 --> 32:36.770
We don't use our...
our hands and fingers.

32:36.804 --> 32:38.438
We...

32:39.505 --> 32:41.574
Look. See this?

32:41.608 --> 32:43.744
Spoon? Spoon?

32:43.777 --> 32:46.013
This... this is how we eat.

32:46.046 --> 32:47.815
Spoon.

33:00.727 --> 33:02.762
And, uh, and we don't sing.

33:05.833 --> 33:07.902
We don't sing at the table.

33:07.935 --> 33:09.569
What you all looking at?

33:09.602 --> 33:11.771
Ain't you never seen
a child eat before?

33:13.874 --> 33:15.842
What's her name?

33:15.876 --> 33:18.511
Johanna.

33:20.513 --> 33:22.515
She doesn't have any English.

33:22.548 --> 33:24.584
So, what does she speak?

33:24.617 --> 33:25.685
Kiowa.

33:39.699 --> 33:40.934
- Mm.
- What?

33:40.967 --> 33:42.835
Wh-What... what did she say?

33:42.869 --> 33:44.804
She said you've been
calling her the wrong name.

33:44.837 --> 33:46.005
Her name's Cicada.

33:48.675 --> 33:50.877
Well, it's Johanna now.

33:50.910 --> 33:53.980
Johanna Leonberger.

33:54.013 --> 33:55.915
This man...

34:17.837 --> 34:20.039
She says she got no home.

34:21.040 --> 34:23.076
No Kiowa family, neither.

34:23.109 --> 34:24.944
You see the hair?

34:24.978 --> 34:27.981
They cut it
when they're in mourning.

34:30.116 --> 34:32.852
This child is an orphan
twice over.

34:43.563 --> 34:46.699
Can you tell her that
I am taking her to family,

34:46.733 --> 34:48.935
to an aunt and an uncle
down near Castroville?

34:48.968 --> 34:52.772
Kidd, she don't got any idea
what that means.

34:54.107 --> 34:58.811
Well, they're the only ones
that will take her.

34:58.845 --> 35:02.081
She's got no place else.
Nobody wants her.

35:12.191 --> 35:15.061
I hear them roads are bad
Castroville way.

35:16.763 --> 35:19.032
Yeah, yeah, so I hear.

35:20.199 --> 35:22.702
Mr. Gannett used to take 'em.

35:24.070 --> 35:26.739
Before he went to California.

35:34.714 --> 35:36.816
Maybe he just didn't want
to come back.

35:52.131 --> 35:56.836
I do not have a clue
as to the care of a child.

35:56.869 --> 36:00.672
Never had the need
nor the patience required.

36:00.705 --> 36:02.375
She's still alive, ain't she?

36:02.408 --> 36:04.177
That's not nothing.

36:32.205 --> 36:34.773
Road taking its toll?

36:37.676 --> 36:39.644
Sleeping through the night

36:39.678 --> 36:41.746
isn't what it once was.

36:42.948 --> 36:44.783
Yeah.

36:45.617 --> 36:49.621
Your stories can only
keep you company for so long.

36:53.091 --> 36:57.162
So, what you gonna do
once you've taken her?

36:58.964 --> 37:01.032
I may just keep heading south.

37:04.136 --> 37:08.907
Work passage on a ship
out of Galveston.

37:10.276 --> 37:15.013
Go see those
far-off places I...

37:15.046 --> 37:17.249
read about to people
every night.

37:27.292 --> 37:29.895
How long's it been?

37:30.962 --> 37:32.998
Close to five years now.

37:35.800 --> 37:38.803
Castroville's San Antonio way.

37:39.971 --> 37:42.107
Yeah. Yes, it is.

37:46.077 --> 37:48.280
Isn't it time you went back?

37:49.347 --> 37:51.816
Made things right with her?

37:58.089 --> 38:00.091
Looking at you now...

38:01.993 --> 38:04.196
...I'm thinking
you don't have a choice.

38:30.288 --> 38:31.957
Good evening.

38:31.990 --> 38:34.159
My name is
Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd,

38:34.192 --> 38:38.363
and it is an honor to be back
in the bustling city of Dallas.

38:38.396 --> 38:41.299
A busy town,
and y'all are busy folk,

38:41.333 --> 38:44.035
so let's get right to it.

38:44.069 --> 38:45.836
Now, when I got in yesterday,

38:45.870 --> 38:47.372
I collected
the latest newspapers,

38:47.405 --> 38:50.774
looking for suitable readings,

38:50.808 --> 38:54.845
something to take us away
from our troubles.

38:54.878 --> 38:59.217
From <i>The Times,</i>
on its page three...

39:17.269 --> 39:19.803
A word, Captain?

39:19.837 --> 39:21.273
Name's Almay.

39:21.306 --> 39:23.275
And these are my associates.

39:23.308 --> 39:25.277
Mr. Almay. Gentlemen.

39:26.344 --> 39:27.945
Enjoyed your reading, Cap.

39:27.978 --> 39:29.581
You take us away
from our hard thoughts.

39:29.614 --> 39:31.015
Thank you.

39:33.050 --> 39:35.052
So, where'd you serve, Captain?

39:36.053 --> 39:37.355
Infantry, Third Texas.

39:37.389 --> 39:38.922
- Ah.
- You?

39:40.358 --> 39:43.428
First Texas Infantry,
Northern Virginia.

39:43.461 --> 39:45.397
Lot of good it did us.

39:45.430 --> 39:47.831
Poor men fighting
a rich man's war.

39:47.865 --> 39:49.301
Left us lying here
in the gutter.

39:51.336 --> 39:53.305
Way I see it, we fought,

39:53.338 --> 39:54.938
but ain't no piece
of this ours.

39:54.972 --> 39:56.341
It's late, Mr. Almay.

39:56.374 --> 39:58.142
And what is your point?

39:58.175 --> 40:01.945
Point is, us old soldiers
got to live, right?

40:03.348 --> 40:06.317
I have a little business
proposition for you,

40:06.351 --> 40:09.920
seeing you traveling alone
like you are.

40:10.921 --> 40:12.222
This young girl.

40:13.991 --> 40:15.192
What do you want?

40:15.225 --> 40:17.861
How much you want for her?

40:17.895 --> 40:20.964
This child is not for sale.

40:23.067 --> 40:26.070
Word is she's that captive
out of Wichita Falls.

40:26.103 --> 40:28.238
Mr. Almay,
you are well-informed.

40:29.406 --> 40:32.343
News of value travels.

40:34.978 --> 40:36.313
How about $50?

40:38.683 --> 40:40.351
All right, a hundred, then.

40:40.384 --> 40:43.354
And you can rest easy knowing
at least she'll get paid.

40:44.388 --> 40:46.123
I mean, look at that fair skin.

40:47.057 --> 40:49.860
I bet you were a lucky man
out there in the desert.

40:50.994 --> 40:52.396
You are scum.

40:52.429 --> 40:54.398
In the alternative,
we could just take her.

40:54.431 --> 40:56.066
- All right, boys.
- What's going on here?

40:56.100 --> 40:57.468
Oh, thank the Lord.

40:59.103 --> 41:00.270
We're local traders, sir.

41:00.304 --> 41:01.505
We became concerned
about the welfare

41:01.538 --> 41:02.906
of this here child
in the clutches

41:02.940 --> 41:04.241
of a strange man such as this.

41:04.274 --> 41:05.943
- Search him.
- I am responsible for

41:05.976 --> 41:07.411
returning this child
to her family down south.

41:07.444 --> 41:08.679
- That's her papers and my oath.
- Stay still.

41:08.713 --> 41:10.080
Your hands.

41:11.014 --> 41:12.516
Captain.

41:12.549 --> 41:15.252
- You got that?
- Yep.

41:23.160 --> 41:26.430
You take this girl,
and you get on your way.

41:26.463 --> 41:28.365
- Let's go.
- Move.

41:28.399 --> 41:30.067
- Go on.
- Write 'em up.

41:30.100 --> 41:32.302
- I'll be seeing you, Captain.
- Keep walking.

41:32.336 --> 41:34.238
You hear me?

41:34.271 --> 41:37.341
I'm coming for you as soon as
I'm done with these blues.

41:38.242 --> 41:41.412
- <i>Name.</i>
- <i>J.G. Almay.</i>

41:43.046 --> 41:44.148
Residency.

41:44.181 --> 41:45.282
12 Polk Street,

41:45.315 --> 41:47.217
<i>Dallas, Texas.</i>

41:48.485 --> 41:49.987
<i>Sign.</i>

42:02.332 --> 42:04.000
Hyah!

42:16.547 --> 42:19.015
Ha!

42:29.326 --> 42:30.960
Captain!

42:31.595 --> 42:34.298
Hyah! Come on!

42:47.276 --> 42:48.545
Hyah!

43:08.532 --> 43:11.635
Come on. Come on.

43:33.089 --> 43:34.323
- Come on.
- Hyah!

43:51.574 --> 43:53.442
Hyah!

44:11.394 --> 44:13.329
Come on. Down, down.

44:25.474 --> 44:28.210
Hey, Cap, didn't I say
I'd come for you?

44:28.244 --> 44:30.413
- Go.
- Didn't I say that?

44:40.356 --> 44:42.124
Come on. Come on.

44:42.158 --> 44:43.225
Move!

44:44.226 --> 44:45.628
Ha! Ha!

46:00.736 --> 46:02.705
Higher. Come, come!

46:05.273 --> 46:06.441
Let's go.

46:37.539 --> 46:38.741
Hey, Cap!

46:38.774 --> 46:42.410
You're good for a man of years.

46:42.444 --> 46:44.714
But ain't you just
so damn tired of all this?

46:44.747 --> 46:47.315
- Help me.
- Didn't we have our body and soul broke out there?

46:47.348 --> 46:50.385
Seems an awful shame
for it to end like this

46:50.418 --> 46:51.586
when you can just join us.

46:51.619 --> 46:53.254
This world...

46:53.288 --> 46:54.824
...rich pickings for some,

46:54.857 --> 46:56.691
slim pickings
for the rest of us.

47:01.696 --> 47:03.364
Shit.

47:06.902 --> 47:08.603
Oh, goddamn it!

47:10.638 --> 47:12.474
You go.

47:12.507 --> 47:14.776
Take the horses and go.

47:15.510 --> 47:17.612
I shoot. You go.

47:21.783 --> 47:22.884
Captain.

47:22.917 --> 47:24.819
No, no. No, this is worthless.

47:26.521 --> 47:28.423
See this? It's for birds.

47:28.456 --> 47:30.759
It's for birds, understand?

47:30.792 --> 47:32.727
You're not thinking
straight, Cap.

47:33.928 --> 47:35.530
She ain't worth dying for.

47:38.399 --> 47:40.335
Go.

47:40.368 --> 47:42.303
Get away while you can.

47:44.405 --> 47:45.507
What do you say, Cap?

47:45.540 --> 47:47.275
Talk to me.

47:53.882 --> 47:55.750
Mr. Almay!

47:56.751 --> 47:59.087
You have me...

47:59.120 --> 48:02.357
in an uncomfortable
circumstance.

48:04.826 --> 48:08.429
How exactly are we
gonna work this out?

48:08.463 --> 48:10.665
I figure a share for each man

48:10.698 --> 48:11.800
and an extra for me.

48:13.568 --> 48:17.605
Considering what you did
to my associate over there.

48:18.673 --> 48:20.575
That sounds pretty fair to me.

48:21.709 --> 48:23.778
So, what do you want me to do?

48:23.812 --> 48:25.713
Just got to turn over
the girl. That's all.

48:25.747 --> 48:26.748
No. Johanna, no!

48:27.782 --> 48:29.350
They don't want our money.

48:29.384 --> 48:30.885
- They want you!
- Captain.

48:48.469 --> 48:51.139
Oh, Cap, what you trying to do,
tickle us to death?

48:51.172 --> 48:53.608
Well, we don't have a deal yet.

48:58.012 --> 48:59.647
Aha!

48:59.681 --> 49:00.949
I think it's 'cause
you're out of bullets

49:00.982 --> 49:03.585
and all you got left now
is bird shot.

49:04.586 --> 49:05.887
Am I right, Cap?

49:05.920 --> 49:08.156
All right, Almay.

49:08.189 --> 49:10.692
Damn it, you have a deal.

49:10.725 --> 49:12.559
All right.

49:13.928 --> 49:16.731
I'm gonna lay my gun down
on this here rock.

49:16.764 --> 49:18.398
How about you do the same?

49:19.667 --> 49:21.635
Here's my sidearm.

49:21.669 --> 49:22.837
Let me see yours.

49:22.871 --> 49:25.372
I'm laying my weapon down.

49:28.943 --> 49:30.812
Here's mine.

49:32.914 --> 49:34.015
Dime-ah.

49:34.048 --> 49:36.918
- Captain, boom?
- Boom, boom.

49:42.924 --> 49:44.926
Clay over there
is gonna show himself.

49:45.592 --> 49:47.628
Then how about you do the same?

49:48.762 --> 49:49.696
Sounds good!

50:04.678 --> 50:06.480
Stay down.

50:44.751 --> 50:46.620
Oh, goddamn it!

50:47.487 --> 50:49.823
Well, now you done gone
and spoiled it, Cap.

50:55.829 --> 50:58.498
Looks like we're back
on opposite sides.

50:58.532 --> 50:59.566
Looks like it.

51:05.739 --> 51:07.708
All right, Cap.

51:07.741 --> 51:10.077
Looks like
I'm coming for you now.

53:33.719 --> 53:35.087
Come on.

53:41.760 --> 53:44.630
♪ Captain... ♪

55:06.078 --> 55:08.214

"Daum daw"?

56:48.447 --> 56:49.981
"Daw."

56:50.014 --> 56:53.051
"Daw" with a...
is a spirit.

56:53.084 --> 56:54.420
A breath.

56:56.455 --> 56:58.823
A circle.

57:01.427 --> 57:05.830
For us, it's more like
a straight line.

57:06.465 --> 57:08.299
A line.

57:09.267 --> 57:10.368
"Li-an."

57:10.401 --> 57:12.003
"Li-an," yes.

57:12.036 --> 57:14.272
We're all journeying
across the prairie

57:14.305 --> 57:16.240
in a straight line

57:16.274 --> 57:18.309
and looking
for that place to be.

57:19.110 --> 57:22.113
And when we find it, we go
straight out and we plow it,

57:22.146 --> 57:24.148
and we plant it
all in a straight line.

57:29.320 --> 57:31.289
Yeah.

57:31.322 --> 57:33.091
Very good.

57:33.124 --> 57:35.093
"Velly gut."

57:35.126 --> 57:38.329
"Velly gut," indeed.

57:38.363 --> 57:41.165
<i>Sehr gut, Onkel.</i>

57:43.334 --> 57:45.002
Whoa, whoa.

57:45.036 --> 57:47.105
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

57:47.138 --> 57:50.007
<i>"Sehr gut, Onkel."</i>
You just spoke German.

57:51.008 --> 57:52.910
<i>Deutsche.</i>

57:55.079 --> 57:57.081
Can you remember anything else?

58:01.252 --> 58:03.421
What else can you remember?

58:15.733 --> 58:17.301
What?

58:17.335 --> 58:19.270
What is it?

58:21.472 --> 58:24.175
Oh, dear God.

58:24.208 --> 58:26.144
Hyah! Hyah!

58:26.177 --> 58:27.412
Hyah!

58:27.445 --> 58:30.014
You just leave that.
You just leave it.

58:30.047 --> 58:31.915
Forget it.

58:33.117 --> 58:36.287
I guess we both have
demons to face,

58:36.320 --> 58:38.322
going down this road.

59:23.099 --> 59:24.435
Good day, gentlemen.

59:24.469 --> 59:26.269
Road's closed.

59:26.304 --> 59:30.106
Ain't nobody unaccounted for
getting into Erath County.

59:30.140 --> 59:31.409
Is that the law?

59:32.410 --> 59:34.044
It is now.

59:50.227 --> 59:52.295
I'm carrying nothing
of any great value.

1:00:05.475 --> 1:00:07.043
What's your name, sir?

1:00:07.845 --> 1:00:11.114
Kidd.
Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd.

1:00:11.147 --> 1:00:14.184
And your reason
for traveling, Cap?

1:00:14.217 --> 1:00:15.653
The news.

1:00:15.686 --> 1:00:18.455
I read the news
to anyone with ten cents

1:00:18.488 --> 1:00:20.123
and the time to hear it.

1:00:24.494 --> 1:00:26.296
Huh.

1:00:28.098 --> 1:00:29.499
My.

1:00:29.533 --> 1:00:33.336
My, my, my, my, my.

1:00:33.370 --> 1:00:36.172
Carrying some damage back here.

1:00:36.206 --> 1:00:39.309
I-I got the wagon cheap, and...

1:00:39.342 --> 1:00:41.311
the holes came with it.

1:00:43.346 --> 1:00:48.251
Well, your newspapers
sure got holes in 'em, mister.

1:00:48.285 --> 1:00:51.254
There ain't nothing in here
about Erath County.

1:00:51.288 --> 1:00:52.857
Hell of a lot's been happening.

1:00:52.890 --> 1:00:54.691
Ain't that right, boys?

1:00:54.724 --> 1:00:56.560
But I don't see it here.

1:00:56.593 --> 1:00:58.562
You know, we've been busy.

1:00:58.595 --> 1:01:00.630
We done fixed them Mexicans.

1:01:00.664 --> 1:01:02.432
Injuns, too.
Pushed them clean out.

1:01:02.465 --> 1:01:05.569
Mr. Farley, he killed
a right smart of Indians.

1:01:07.337 --> 1:01:10.073
He scalped them real good, too.

1:01:11.308 --> 1:01:13.209
We're building
a whole new world

1:01:13.243 --> 1:01:15.545
down here in Erath County.

1:01:15.579 --> 1:01:17.614
But ain't none of it writ here.

1:01:19.482 --> 1:01:21.484
That news didn't travel.

1:01:22.686 --> 1:01:24.354
Let's take care of that.

1:01:25.155 --> 1:01:27.891
Why don't we have us
a little read?

1:01:27.924 --> 1:01:30.226
What do you say...

1:01:31.227 --> 1:01:32.429
...news man?

1:01:36.232 --> 1:01:37.601
Go on, move.

1:02:09.532 --> 1:02:12.167
Wash out that blood.

1:02:12.201 --> 1:02:14.604
Don't be staring. Keep working.

1:02:16.573 --> 1:02:20.142
When he gets done here,
bring him into town.

1:02:57.681 --> 1:03:00.282
What business is Mr. Farley in?

1:03:00.315 --> 1:03:01.517
Mr. Far...

1:03:01.550 --> 1:03:04.186
Business to never mind
your business.

1:03:07.757 --> 1:03:09.358
What's your name?

1:03:09.391 --> 1:03:11.460
John Calley.

1:03:13.663 --> 1:03:16.632
Is Mr. Farley
family to you, John?

1:03:16.666 --> 1:03:19.535
Nah, Mr. Farley, he ain't
any kin of mine. No, no.

1:03:19.568 --> 1:03:21.603
I ain't got no kin
now Tommy's gone.

1:03:22.404 --> 1:03:25.474
But I work for Mr. Farley
all same.

1:03:26.675 --> 1:03:29.278
What happened to... to Tommy?

1:03:29.311 --> 1:03:30.747
Mr. Farley gone shot him.

1:03:33.415 --> 1:03:36.318
For hollering and questioning.

1:03:36.351 --> 1:03:37.854
Got thoughts of things
in his head.

1:03:37.887 --> 1:03:40.322
He couldn't keep 'em in there.

1:03:40.355 --> 1:03:42.224
Loud, loud mouth.

1:04:23.099 --> 1:04:25.334
Have him read that.

1:04:34.710 --> 1:04:36.411
Hey, Captain.

1:04:37.679 --> 1:04:39.848
Mr. Farley says to read this.

1:04:42.851 --> 1:04:45.687
Stoke it up.
This fire's got to burn.

1:04:47.589 --> 1:04:50.325
Dime-ah? Dime-ah?

1:04:50.359 --> 1:04:52.661
- Dime-ah?
- There you go.

1:05:05.140 --> 1:05:06.775
Dime-ah?

1:05:09.611 --> 1:05:10.779
Dime-ah?

1:05:17.953 --> 1:05:19.755
Dime-ah?

1:05:22.724 --> 1:05:24.126
You, sir.

1:05:29.430 --> 1:05:32.366
Good evening, ladies
and gentlemen. My name...

1:05:39.675 --> 1:05:42.544
My name is
Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd.

1:05:43.979 --> 1:05:47.448
And Mr. Farley has asked me
to come here tonight

1:05:47.481 --> 1:05:49.685
to read to y'all the news.

1:05:49.718 --> 1:05:52.453
He's been kind enough
to supply me

1:05:52.486 --> 1:05:55.456
with a copy of his own
<i>Erath Journal.</i>

1:05:55.489 --> 1:05:59.661
Sure looks like Mr. Farley
is a very busy man

1:05:59.695 --> 1:06:01.562
in these parts.

1:06:01.596 --> 1:06:05.701
He's an editor and a publisher,
a businessman, a lawgiver.

1:06:05.734 --> 1:06:11.606
And all of you fine folk
working for him, at that.

1:06:12.708 --> 1:06:14.508
Absolutely.

1:06:14.542 --> 1:06:16.611
But the way I see it,

1:06:16.644 --> 1:06:18.446
none of that is news.

1:06:19.547 --> 1:06:23.819
So let me see
if I can't tempt you

1:06:23.852 --> 1:06:25.888
with something else.

1:06:27.688 --> 1:06:29.757
The <i>Harper</i> illustrated.

1:06:29.790 --> 1:06:33.828
It has a story reporting
from the lonely little town

1:06:33.862 --> 1:06:36.497
of Keel Run, Pennsylvania.

1:06:36.530 --> 1:06:37.900
I got a bad feeling about this.

1:06:37.933 --> 1:06:39.500
Just give him a minute.

1:06:39.533 --> 1:06:41.502
Now, Keel Run
ain't known for much.

1:06:41.535 --> 1:06:43.504
And I'm counting
none of y'all have heard of it

1:06:43.537 --> 1:06:45.473
since, well,
it is in the North.

1:06:45.506 --> 1:06:46.641
Why should you?

1:06:48.809 --> 1:06:50.678
Keel Run is
just one of a thousand

1:06:50.711 --> 1:06:54.615
little towns across our nation
birthed by the work of many

1:06:54.649 --> 1:06:58.452
but enjoyed by the few.

1:06:58.486 --> 1:07:00.755
Now, Keel Run is no Durand.

1:07:00.788 --> 1:07:03.958
It does not trade in buffalo
but in coal.

1:07:03.991 --> 1:07:06.861
And just like you,
every morning,

1:07:06.894 --> 1:07:09.897
its men rise early
from their beds

1:07:09.931 --> 1:07:15.736
only to descend into
the great, black coal mine.

1:07:15.770 --> 1:07:19.006
"On the morning of February 11,

1:07:19.040 --> 1:07:24.645
"37 men of the Run attended
their first shift at noon.

1:07:24.679 --> 1:07:26.881
"But before the next hour

1:07:26.914 --> 1:07:29.784
"was up, Keel Run's
wheel of fortune had turned,

1:07:29.817 --> 1:07:32.820
"for the mine,
the coal mine itself,

1:07:32.853 --> 1:07:34.689
had caught fire."

1:07:36.924 --> 1:07:39.727
The first dozen died
in an instant.

1:07:40.861 --> 1:07:42.830
Another seven not long after.

1:07:44.598 --> 1:07:46.767
But I'm not here
to tell you the story

1:07:46.801 --> 1:07:49.103
of those unfortunate souls

1:07:49.136 --> 1:07:51.772
or of the mine owner

1:07:51.806 --> 1:07:54.842
who'd been so lax
about their safety,

1:07:54.875 --> 1:07:57.611
sitting up there
in his fancy home,

1:07:57.645 --> 1:08:00.948
counting the money
produced by their labor.

1:08:00.982 --> 1:08:02.984
No, no, no,
I'm here to tell you

1:08:03.017 --> 1:08:06.087
about the 11 men who lived.

1:08:06.120 --> 1:08:08.089
Yeah!

1:08:08.122 --> 1:08:09.690
Who survived that fire.

1:08:09.724 --> 1:08:12.660
The 11 men who fought back

1:08:12.693 --> 1:08:15.029
against their deadly fate.

1:08:15.062 --> 1:08:17.031
- Yeah!
- Yes! Yes!

1:08:17.064 --> 1:08:21.002
Thought I told you to read
from the <i>Erath,</i> Captain.

1:08:21.035 --> 1:08:22.937
Well, see,
Mr. Farley, I was wondering

1:08:22.970 --> 1:08:24.939
if folks might prefer
some storytelling

1:08:24.972 --> 1:08:27.575
- from places outside of Erath.
- Let's hear it!

1:08:27.608 --> 1:08:29.844
Just for tonight, Mr. Farley.

1:08:29.877 --> 1:08:31.746
I think you ought to read

1:08:31.779 --> 1:08:33.047
from the <i>Erath</i>
all the same, Captain.

1:08:35.149 --> 1:08:37.918
Sort of thing these people
expect to hear.

1:08:37.952 --> 1:08:39.687
Let's hear what he has to say.

1:08:39.720 --> 1:08:41.055
How about we vote on it?

1:08:42.656 --> 1:08:43.691
How about we don't?

1:08:43.724 --> 1:08:46.160
Now, I can read

1:08:46.193 --> 1:08:48.696
from Mr. Farley's
<i>Erath Journal...</i>

1:08:50.630 --> 1:08:53.134
...or I can keep on with the
story of the men of Keel Run.

1:08:57.805 --> 1:08:59.907
- I vote men of the Run!
- Keel Run?

1:08:59.940 --> 1:09:01.909
- All right. Very good.
- Let's hear it, Captain.

1:09:01.942 --> 1:09:06.180
That day, those 11 men
were facing a mortal enemy...

1:09:06.213 --> 1:09:08.681
Go now. Shut this
fucking thing down. Now.

1:09:08.715 --> 1:09:10.084
- Go. Go!
- ...intent on destroying everything

1:09:10.117 --> 1:09:11.852
they ever cared about,
everything they'd built...

1:09:11.886 --> 1:09:13.753
- Show's over, folks!
- ...every pillar of progress

1:09:13.787 --> 1:09:15.789
- of their own civilization.
- Show's over! Now, go on home.

1:09:15.823 --> 1:09:17.791
And I tell you,
those men refused defeat.

1:09:17.825 --> 1:09:19.193
In the dark,
they kept their heads

1:09:19.226 --> 1:09:21.095
- and they worked together!
- Get out of here!

1:09:21.128 --> 1:09:23.064
- Those men fought back...
- Go home now!

1:09:23.097 --> 1:09:24.965
- Move! Go on, get out!
- ...against the odds,

1:09:24.999 --> 1:09:26.666
for better lives,

1:09:26.699 --> 1:09:27.902
- for freedom!
- You think that's funny, boy?

1:09:32.206 --> 1:09:34.208
- I got him!
- Whoa!

1:09:38.412 --> 1:09:41.015
- Johanna!
- Captain!

1:09:45.152 --> 1:09:47.088
Move!

1:09:47.121 --> 1:09:49.156
Y'all, clear out! Clear out!

1:10:19.253 --> 1:10:22.088
You should've just read,
Captain.

1:10:22.122 --> 1:10:25.191
I was just giving the people
a choice, Mr. Farley.

1:10:27.193 --> 1:10:28.962
Well, you can read now.

1:10:33.867 --> 1:10:37.637
You got no idea
what we deal with down here.

1:10:40.140 --> 1:10:43.643
Mexicans, blacks, Indians.

1:10:44.310 --> 1:10:47.013
Give 'em an inch,

1:10:47.046 --> 1:10:50.183
and every one will slit
your throat where you piss.

1:10:52.018 --> 1:10:54.921
The war is over, Mr. Farley.

1:10:55.955 --> 1:10:59.192
We have to stop fighting
sometime.

1:10:59.225 --> 1:11:01.928
Oh, we will.

1:11:03.062 --> 1:11:05.098
When it's ours alone.

1:11:07.867 --> 1:11:10.003
Come here. Don't...

1:11:10.036 --> 1:11:11.871
Stand up!

1:11:11.905 --> 1:11:14.174
Yeah. Get up. Stand up.

1:11:22.815 --> 1:11:25.218
You ready to read, Cap?

1:11:44.771 --> 1:11:46.239
No. No.

1:11:47.240 --> 1:11:49.075
No! No!

1:12:04.958 --> 1:12:06.159
I like your stories.

1:12:27.146 --> 1:12:29.115
I tell you,

1:12:29.148 --> 1:12:31.783
I ain't never heard
of news reading

1:12:31.817 --> 1:12:33.752
as a business before.

1:12:36.155 --> 1:12:38.824
It's not a rich man's
occupation,

1:12:38.857 --> 1:12:40.926
as you can see.

1:12:40.959 --> 1:12:43.862
Well, so how-how did you
bother in it, then?

1:12:45.964 --> 1:12:47.966
I was a printer by trade.

1:12:49.168 --> 1:12:53.172
And I had a printworks
in San Antonio.

1:12:53.206 --> 1:12:55.941
Printed up newspapers.

1:12:57.410 --> 1:12:59.845
Then the war came.

1:13:01.614 --> 1:13:05.050
When it was over,
it was all gone.

1:13:06.319 --> 1:13:08.221
I lost everything.

1:13:09.021 --> 1:13:12.891
Had to make a new life
for myself right there.

1:13:18.364 --> 1:13:22.034
Couldn't print the newspapers
anymore, but I could read 'em.

1:13:22.067 --> 1:13:24.404
And that's what I've been doing
from town to town.

1:13:27.473 --> 1:13:29.375
You got family and all?

1:13:31.176 --> 1:13:33.211
Left a wife in San Antonio.

1:13:35.013 --> 1:13:36.248
Really?

1:14:06.345 --> 1:14:07.446
Mm.

1:14:46.485 --> 1:14:49.888
Well, all right.
This is you, John Calley.

1:14:51.523 --> 1:14:53.158
Okay.

1:15:00.098 --> 1:15:02.033
All right.

1:15:07.038 --> 1:15:09.074
I could come with y'all.

1:15:10.509 --> 1:15:13.512
Yeah, I heard all about
Hill Country.

1:15:13.545 --> 1:15:15.547
That's Kiowa land.

1:15:15.580 --> 1:15:18.949
If they find you,
they'd kill you.

1:15:21.319 --> 1:15:24.189
The railroad's that way, John.

1:15:24.222 --> 1:15:26.391
Go make something of your own.

1:15:29.127 --> 1:15:31.229
At least...

1:15:31.263 --> 1:15:33.365
take this gun.

1:15:33.398 --> 1:15:35.333
I could get another real easy.

1:15:37.235 --> 1:15:39.271
Just take it for her.

1:15:41.506 --> 1:15:44.476
Say, Captain...

1:15:46.076 --> 1:15:48.346
...those men holed up
in that mine,

1:15:48.380 --> 1:15:51.982
they really beat the fire
and get home?

1:15:57.121 --> 1:15:59.990
Yeah, they really did.

1:16:06.163 --> 1:16:08.165
Right there.

1:16:11.369 --> 1:16:13.270
Well, goddamn.

1:16:14.271 --> 1:16:15.507
Ain't that something, huh?

1:16:18.410 --> 1:16:20.277
Good luck to you, John.

1:16:20.311 --> 1:16:21.379
Thank you.

1:16:21.413 --> 1:16:23.347
Come on.

1:16:23.381 --> 1:16:25.517
Good luck.

1:16:59.684 --> 1:17:03.120
Will you teach me
that song you always sing?

1:17:03.153 --> 1:17:06.457
The one that goes...

1:18:21.398 --> 1:18:22.533
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:19:08.979 --> 1:19:11.347
We have to stay
on the main road!

1:19:11.382 --> 1:19:12.716
Main road!

1:19:20.591 --> 1:19:22.626
We go.

1:20:10.874 --> 1:20:13.476
You don't have to do this.

1:20:15.045 --> 1:20:17.480
They aren't there anymore.

1:20:22.418 --> 1:20:24.454
Su-hanna go.

1:22:24.874 --> 1:22:26.909
<i>Mama, Papa tot?</i>

1:22:29.011 --> 1:22:30.613
Yes.

1:22:30.646 --> 1:22:32.582
They're dead.

1:23:05.547 --> 1:23:09.784
I want to get you away
from all this pain and killing,

1:23:09.819 --> 1:23:11.854
get you clear of it.

1:23:13.788 --> 1:23:15.925
Going back, it's not good.

1:23:21.630 --> 1:23:23.665
Need to put it behind you.

1:23:25.533 --> 1:23:27.970
Move forward. Huh?

1:23:30.039 --> 1:23:31.941
- Li-an.
- Yes.

1:23:32.942 --> 1:23:35.644
Stay on that line.

1:23:36.645 --> 1:23:39.015
And don't look back, hmm?

1:24:00.936 --> 1:24:02.737
Whoa.

1:24:04.973 --> 1:24:06.708
Whoa.

1:24:06.741 --> 1:24:08.443
- Captain!
- Hang on.

1:24:13.848 --> 1:24:15.984
Take the reins!

1:24:29.898 --> 1:24:32.534
Jump! Jump, Johanna!

1:26:16.770 --> 1:26:18.806
Yeah, good. All right.

1:27:21.735 --> 1:27:23.670
Horses.

1:28:05.812 --> 1:28:07.214
Johanna!

1:28:09.816 --> 1:28:11.785
Johanna!

1:28:26.767 --> 1:28:28.168
Johanna!

1:28:30.237 --> 1:28:32.272
Where are you?

1:28:37.945 --> 1:28:39.246
Johanna!

1:28:40.914 --> 1:28:42.216
Johanna!

1:28:43.984 --> 1:28:45.252
Johanna!

1:28:48.555 --> 1:28:50.790
Johanna!

1:28:56.263 --> 1:28:58.265
Johanna!

1:29:05.038 --> 1:29:06.739
Johanna!

1:29:10.010 --> 1:29:11.245
Jo...

1:29:42.875 --> 1:29:44.177
Thank God.

1:29:44.211 --> 1:29:46.078
Johanna!

1:31:58.244 --> 1:32:01.380
Young man, I'm looking for
the Leonbergers of Castroville.

1:32:03.282 --> 1:32:04.983
Straight.

1:32:15.461 --> 1:32:17.563
Do we read story?

1:32:17.596 --> 1:32:19.931
Dime-ah?

1:32:21.233 --> 1:32:23.935
No, no story here.

1:32:25.069 --> 1:32:26.539
No dime-ah?

1:32:27.573 --> 1:32:30.074
No, no dime-ah.

1:32:41.787 --> 1:32:44.022
We go there?

1:32:45.156 --> 1:32:46.459
Yes.

1:32:48.059 --> 1:32:49.562
Yes, we go there.

1:32:51.129 --> 1:32:53.031
No. No, Cap.

1:32:53.064 --> 1:32:54.567
- No. We go dime-ah.
- No. No.

1:32:54.600 --> 1:32:56.034
- We go.
- No.

1:32:56.067 --> 1:32:57.302
We go!

1:32:57.336 --> 1:32:59.472
We go. No.

1:32:59.505 --> 1:33:01.272
No, we go.

1:33:01.306 --> 1:33:06.144
This is... this is
where you belong now, Johanna.

1:33:12.551 --> 1:33:14.553
This is your home now.

1:33:22.327 --> 1:33:24.329
Good day.

1:33:24.362 --> 1:33:28.099
I have business
with the Leonberger family.

1:33:29.200 --> 1:33:31.135
<i>Ja?</i>

1:33:32.337 --> 1:33:35.574
This child is
Johanna Leonberger.

1:33:39.444 --> 1:33:42.013
Anna.

1:33:52.323 --> 1:33:56.394
My sister, she always
went her own way.

1:33:56.427 --> 1:34:00.431
We said, "Stay in Castroville,"
but she and her husband Wolf,

1:34:00.465 --> 1:34:03.134
they wanted to be
out there in the valley

1:34:03.167 --> 1:34:04.435
where the land is cheaper.

1:34:04.469 --> 1:34:06.371
Hmm?

1:34:14.579 --> 1:34:18.082
So, she thinks
she's an Indian now?

1:34:18.116 --> 1:34:20.451
Well, s-something in between.

1:34:22.587 --> 1:34:26.157
She needs time to adjust.

1:34:26.190 --> 1:34:28.593
She must work.

1:34:28.626 --> 1:34:31.596
She must learn...

1:34:38.436 --> 1:34:40.371
The proper ways.

1:34:40.405 --> 1:34:42.574
Of course.

1:34:42.607 --> 1:34:45.476
You know, my sister, when
we found her in the bedroom,

1:34:45.510 --> 1:34:47.178
they cut her throat.

1:34:48.346 --> 1:34:50.448
The baby sister...

1:34:50.481 --> 1:34:53.117
they bashed the brain out.

1:34:53.918 --> 1:34:56.554
Best if she forgets all that.

1:34:58.356 --> 1:35:01.225
She needs new memories.

1:35:04.262 --> 1:35:06.297
Who knows what
they will have taught her?

1:35:08.266 --> 1:35:10.602
But we must try
to see her as a blessing.

1:35:12.570 --> 1:35:14.505
And we need the extra hands.

1:35:19.210 --> 1:35:24.147
You want money
for bring her here?

1:35:24.181 --> 1:35:27.218
No.
No, I don't want your money.

1:35:29.387 --> 1:35:31.522
Buy her books.

1:35:31.556 --> 1:35:34.092
- Books?
- So she can read.

1:35:36.394 --> 1:35:38.596
She likes stories.

1:36:17.234 --> 1:36:18.736
I will go.

1:36:18.770 --> 1:36:20.972
You want some food
for the journey?

1:36:21.005 --> 1:36:23.240
No, thank you.

1:36:27.712 --> 1:36:29.579
He's leaving, child.

1:36:34.451 --> 1:36:37.487
You ungrateful girl. This man,
he brought you on home.

1:36:37.521 --> 1:36:39.322
That's all right.

1:36:41.324 --> 1:36:45.295
Maybe she doesn't understand
what's happening.

1:39:52.514 --> 1:39:54.885
I think Michael did this.

1:39:54.918 --> 1:39:57.386
"Expressly agreed."

1:39:59.022 --> 1:40:01.423
I'm not sure
that that's accurate.

1:40:01.457 --> 1:40:02.893
We'll have to inform Mr. Young

1:40:02.926 --> 1:40:04.827
about the rewriting
of this contract, no?

1:40:04.860 --> 1:40:06.662
This here.

1:40:07.964 --> 1:40:09.732
Hello, Willie.

1:40:09.765 --> 1:40:12.501
Jeffrey.

1:40:12.534 --> 1:40:14.904
My God.

1:40:14.938 --> 1:40:18.008
Gentlemen, this is...

1:40:18.041 --> 1:40:21.543
my d-dear old friend
Captain Jeffrey Kidd.

1:40:21.577 --> 1:40:23.013
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

1:40:23.046 --> 1:40:24.780
Gentlemen.

1:40:24.813 --> 1:40:26.682
Please.

1:40:39.862 --> 1:40:41.997
She's at the church.

1:40:44.033 --> 1:40:46.435
In the garden.

1:40:49.605 --> 1:40:51.974
It was cholera.

1:40:53.943 --> 1:40:56.578
There's nothing
you could have done.

1:40:58.281 --> 1:40:59.949
Doctor said.

1:41:01.817 --> 1:41:05.621
It was being away
for four years of war, Willie.

1:41:05.654 --> 1:41:08.057
Four years with all
the killing and all the blood.

1:41:10.559 --> 1:41:12.895
Of wanting to go home
every day.

1:41:14.596 --> 1:41:18.634
Of wanting to see her
and feel her.

1:41:18.667 --> 1:41:22.805
To talk and laugh
and dream and...

1:41:25.107 --> 1:41:27.910
...and think
of having a family.

1:41:29.611 --> 1:41:33.515
Instead, I got a letter
delivered to my tent...

1:41:34.417 --> 1:41:39.521
...saying she was gone
and already buried.

1:41:42.725 --> 1:41:44.760
That's when I knew.

1:41:45.928 --> 1:41:49.031
God's curse on me
had taken her.

1:41:51.033 --> 1:41:53.802
It was sickness, Jeff,
just sickness.

1:41:53.836 --> 1:41:55.571
It wasn't sickness.

1:41:56.572 --> 1:41:59.074
It was judgment

1:41:59.108 --> 1:42:01.577
for all I had seen...

1:42:03.578 --> 1:42:05.647
...and all I had done.

1:42:11.720 --> 1:42:14.023
I've known you 50 years.

1:42:16.725 --> 1:42:18.761
Since we were boys.

1:42:20.996 --> 1:42:23.799
We didn't ask for any of this.

1:42:25.067 --> 1:42:27.903
But it fell to us
to do the fighting.

1:42:30.139 --> 1:42:31.807
We lived.

1:42:34.009 --> 1:42:35.676
She died.

1:42:38.679 --> 1:42:40.949
That's not judgment.

1:42:42.683 --> 1:42:44.887
It's just what
we had to face and...

1:42:45.954 --> 1:42:47.990
...carry the rest of our days.

1:45:55.842 --> 1:45:58.112
Ha! Ha!

1:46:04.017 --> 1:46:05.852
Giddyap!

1:47:41.348 --> 1:47:43.049
We had to tie her.

1:47:45.018 --> 1:47:46.986
She runs away.

1:47:47.987 --> 1:47:49.389
She's a child.

1:47:51.091 --> 1:47:54.160
She... no work.

1:47:56.930 --> 1:47:58.365
My mistake.

1:48:02.135 --> 1:48:04.270
She doesn't belong here.

1:48:13.046 --> 1:48:15.081
I'm sorry.

1:48:18.485 --> 1:48:20.887
I'm sorry.

1:48:38.071 --> 1:48:40.106
Johanna...

1:48:50.383 --> 1:48:53.052
Captain, Johanna go?

1:48:56.589 --> 1:48:58.358
Yes.

1:49:00.025 --> 1:49:02.060
If that's what you want.

1:50:17.469 --> 1:50:20.005
Captain, Johanna go.

1:50:56.141 --> 1:50:57.543
<i>Now, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1:50:57.576 --> 1:50:59.444
<i>for this final story
of the day.</i>

1:51:01.313 --> 1:51:04.851
"A man dead and buried

1:51:04.884 --> 1:51:07.586
"has risen from the grave.

1:51:07.619 --> 1:51:11.356
"Three days ago,
in Baton Rouge, Louisiana,

1:51:11.390 --> 1:51:15.260
"a Mr. Alfred Blackstone
of 47 years

1:51:15.294 --> 1:51:17.496
"fell into a stupor.

1:51:17.529 --> 1:51:20.432
"His wife called the physician,
but there being no pulse,

1:51:20.465 --> 1:51:22.601
"it was determined
that Mr. Blackstone was,

1:51:22.634 --> 1:51:25.203
- most unfortunately, dead."
- Aw.

1:51:25.237 --> 1:51:27.573
"He was buried very swiftly
on the grounds

1:51:27.606 --> 1:51:29.575
"of the local church,

1:51:29.608 --> 1:51:32.477
"where, as divine providence
would have it,

1:51:32.511 --> 1:51:35.414
"a wedding was due to
take place the following day.

1:51:37.616 --> 1:51:42.220
"But nearing the church doors,
the bride abruptly stopped.

1:51:42.254 --> 1:51:45.223
"From the cemetery beyond,

1:51:45.257 --> 1:51:49.094
"she had heard
this inexplicable sound.

1:51:54.766 --> 1:51:59.605
"The desperate, unmistakable
hammering of life.

1:52:01.506 --> 1:52:03.342
"In a state
of frantic excitement,

1:52:03.375 --> 1:52:06.578
"she ran to a nearby grave
marked 'Alfred Blackstone.'

1:52:08.413 --> 1:52:10.248
"And within moments,

1:52:10.282 --> 1:52:12.918
"the entire wedding
congregation was digging.

1:52:15.387 --> 1:52:18.290
"Finally,
poor Alfred Blackstone

1:52:18.323 --> 1:52:21.627
"was pulled from the earth
very much alive.

1:52:24.195 --> 1:52:27.332
"And from his widow
Blackstone's embrace,

1:52:27.366 --> 1:52:32.269
"Alfred turned to the groom
and said, and I quote,

1:52:32.303 --> 1:52:35.374
"'Feller, when you get
in that church

1:52:35.407 --> 1:52:39.210
"'and she says,
"Till death us do part"...

1:52:40.712 --> 1:52:42.748
...don't you believe
a word of it.'"

1:52:51.222 --> 1:52:54.693
My name is
Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd.

1:52:54.726 --> 1:52:57.963
This is Miss Johanna Kidd.

1:53:03.802 --> 1:53:06.270
And that is all the news
of the world we have for you.

1:53:06.303 --> 1:53:07.438
We thank you, and good night.
