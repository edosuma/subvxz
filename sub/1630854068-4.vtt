19:23.997 --> 19:25.738
I'm not a real Roman?

19:25.890 --> 19:27.165
Okay, fine, you know what?

19:27.392 --> 19:28.982
You want to hear the truth?
Here it is.

19:29.076 --> 19:31.060
Ever since Mama died...

19:31.078 --> 19:33.062
no, no, it was long before that,

19:33.080 --> 19:35.748
you've been lost,
and that makes you

19:35.900 --> 19:36.916
an easy target for sharks

19:37.068 --> 19:39.326
like that Jamie what's-his-name.

19:39.420 --> 19:41.737
I mean, can't you see
what he's trying to do?

19:41.830 --> 19:44.682
Yeah. Make me relevant again.

19:44.833 --> 19:47.226
I got to go.

19:48.930 --> 19:51.731
(door opens, closes)

19:53.175 --> 19:56.360
(guitar playing in other room)

20:16.582 --> 20:17.757
Good morning.

20:18.793 --> 20:21.034
Hi. That is not fair.

20:21.128 --> 20:22.202
Waking up before me.

20:22.222 --> 20:23.796
Why? 'Cause now
you can't sneak out?

20:23.890 --> 20:26.182
Uh, no, 'cause
it's my hotel room.

20:28.619 --> 20:30.469
Okay. I'm busted.

20:30.621 --> 20:31.787
(both chuckle)

20:31.806 --> 20:34.473
But I do have to
get back to Austin.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.809
Start rehearsing
something, anything.

20:36.961 --> 20:40.238
-You know, it's gonna be okay.
-Is it?

20:41.407 --> 20:44.057
'Cause it's supposed to be
my moment, and...

20:44.151 --> 20:47.078
my little sister,
who I've protected and cared for

20:47.229 --> 20:48.895
my entire life,
is trying to take it from me,

20:49.064 --> 20:50.823
so...

20:50.975 --> 20:52.232
Well, listen,

20:52.326 --> 20:54.493
like I was telling you
yesterday, before we got, uh...

20:54.645 --> 20:55.995
sidetracked,

20:56.147 --> 20:57.663
I think I can help.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.331
But I got to tell you,

20:59.425 --> 21:01.074
this song is not just for you,

21:01.168 --> 21:02.468
it's about you.

21:04.097 --> 21:05.154

22:32.185 --> 22:34.835
It just doesn't make any sense,

22:34.854 --> 22:36.729
why Dottie would
sell those songs.

22:42.028 --> 22:44.436
You do know something
about this.

22:44.530 --> 22:45.863
Albie, I've worked
for the Roman family

22:46.014 --> 22:47.347
longer than I've had
one of my own.

22:47.367 --> 22:49.274
Dottie trusted me implicitly.

22:49.427 --> 22:51.093
I swore I'd take this
to my grave.

22:51.112 --> 22:54.330
Which may be sooner
than you think.

22:57.284 --> 23:00.119
A few years back,
Dottie needed money.

23:00.195 --> 23:02.380
A lot and quickly.
She didn't want anybody to know.

23:02.531 --> 23:05.624
-Money for what?
-Dottie was being blackmailed.

23:05.793 --> 23:07.718
Started about five years back.

23:07.870 --> 23:10.370
$50,000 a month, every month.

23:10.464 --> 23:12.205
Paid to who?

23:12.299 --> 23:13.982
If she knew, she wasn't telling.

23:13.984 --> 23:15.709
I tried to get
to the bottom of it.

23:15.803 --> 23:18.896
Hell, I even put a P.I. on it.
I never could find out.

23:19.123 --> 23:20.523
I swear, it's all I know.

23:24.237 --> 23:25.978
All right, well,
here's what you're gonna do now.

23:26.072 --> 23:28.464
You reach out
to those spineless bastards,

23:28.482 --> 23:30.557
and you tell them
that this ends today.

23:30.576 --> 23:34.495
You tell them that Albie Roman
ain't paying them another cent.

23:49.003 --> 23:51.745
-Hey.
-You're back.

23:51.822 --> 23:55.099
Yeah. I got to start rehearsing
my song for the rodeo.

23:55.250 --> 23:57.309
So you found something?

23:58.846 --> 24:00.329
I did. I'm not gonna
say much about it yet,

24:00.347 --> 24:02.231
but I hear that yours is great.

24:03.834 --> 24:05.759
You want to-- want to, um...

24:05.778 --> 24:07.736
You want to give me
a sneak preview?

24:08.931 --> 24:09.989
I'd rather not.

24:10.098 --> 24:13.492
It's, um, something
very personal to me.

24:16.363 --> 24:18.289
I bet.

24:18.440 --> 24:21.033
You know, uh, all the time
I was in Nashville,

24:21.185 --> 24:24.611
I kept thinking
about Mama's song.

24:24.705 --> 24:26.855
You know, the one that
she left for Daddy.

24:26.874 --> 24:28.524
Just kept

24:28.617 --> 24:30.134
going around and around
in my head.

24:30.361 --> 24:32.044
Like she knew
all the pain I was...

24:32.196 --> 24:33.529
I was going through with Clive.

24:33.622 --> 24:35.139
I'm...

24:35.366 --> 24:36.974
real sorry you've been
feeling that.

24:37.125 --> 24:39.868
Me, too.

24:39.887 --> 24:43.539
Being betrayed by someone
you trust is painful.

24:43.632 --> 24:47.067
I hope you never
have to feel that.

-I'm Jamie Burke.

27:04.698 --> 27:06.272

27:15.709 --> 27:18.010
-what song are you
singing today?
-I'm...

27:19.621 --> 27:22.622
I'm singing something I've had
tucked away for a long time and,

27:22.716 --> 27:24.642
well, thinking of recording it.

27:24.793 --> 27:26.201
May I ask why you haven't?

27:26.294 --> 27:28.562
Because it wasn't ready.

27:32.877 --> 27:35.544
Now, are you fooling yourself
or are you trying to fool me?

27:35.562 --> 27:38.714
-Excuse me?
-Come on. We both know
what's at stake here today.

27:38.732 --> 27:40.716
You're singing
in your mother's shadow

27:40.734 --> 27:42.234
first year she's been gone,

27:42.386 --> 27:45.311
and so is your sister,
the overnight viral sensation.

27:45.331 --> 27:47.389
My sister and I are not
in competition.

27:47.408 --> 27:48.666
Well, that's not what I hear.

27:50.060 --> 27:53.003
Nicky, you're so talented
and beautiful.

27:53.155 --> 27:56.548
In fact, you're spectacular.

27:58.085 --> 27:59.568
But you're not your mama.

27:59.661 --> 28:01.920
Well, now I know why my brother
loves you so much.

28:02.072 --> 28:03.997
No, what I'm trying
to tell you is, don't be

28:04.091 --> 28:07.017
some Gen Y clone
of Dottie Roman.

28:08.187 --> 28:10.170
If you go out there
and serve these folks

28:10.189 --> 28:12.672
some recycled song that you-you
meant to record way back when,

28:12.692 --> 28:15.751
but there's probably a damn good
reason why you didn't,

28:15.769 --> 28:17.486
your sister's gonna leave you
in the dust.

28:19.089 --> 28:21.590

28:21.608 --> 28:24.350
what you need is to...

28:24.370 --> 28:26.704
is to let your heart
bleed out there.

28:28.523 --> 28:30.708
Or you're better off
not going on at all.

28:34.621 --> 28:36.380
