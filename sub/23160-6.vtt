WEBVTT

00:00.073 --> 00:01.802
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

00:01.841 --> 00:04.469
- As a matter of fact...
- Not at all. Won't you join us?

00:09.182 --> 00:11.446
He certainly is an engaging man.

00:11.484 --> 00:14.180
He must be overwhelmed
by available females.

00:14.220 --> 00:17.155
<i>I suppose some women
might find him attractive,</i>

00:17.190 --> 00:20.956
<i>if they respond
to the more primitive elements.</i>

00:20.994 --> 00:24.987
How could you betray me?
To steal her from me.

00:26.099 --> 00:29.899
I revere words like honor and integrity.
Clearly not in your vocabulary.

00:29.936 --> 00:33.497
You're just gonna sit there sipping brandy,
being terribly British?

00:33.539 --> 00:34.539
Yes.

03:17.937 --> 03:21.600
- She doesn't have a chance.
- Come on, she's got great form.

03:21.641 --> 03:24.542
In a bikini maybe,
but on a surf ski, she's a joke.

03:24.577 --> 03:29.071
- If you want to put money on her, go ahead.
- She's OK but she's not in my league.

03:29.115 --> 03:32.209
What about the lifeguard
from the Sand & Surf Club?

03:32.251 --> 03:36.415
He's been working out in my gym.
Saw him bench press three and a quarter.

03:36.455 --> 03:40.619
That's OK for strength, but
strength is not as important as endurance.

03:40.660 --> 03:42.685
No, finesse is what counts.

03:42.728 --> 03:45.356
Kiyoki has finesse
and he is golden with a paddle.

03:45.398 --> 03:49.300
- I am working on this new style and...
- What are the odds on Kiyoki?

03:49.335 --> 03:51.963
Kiyoki starts at two and he's a sure thing.

03:52.004 --> 03:56.498
- Wait a minute, guys. What about me?
- What about you?

03:56.542 --> 04:00.638
I'm in this race too and I think
I stand a good chance of winning this year.

04:05.718 --> 04:09.711
Two years ago he comes in 86th,
last year he comes in 62nd.

04:09.755 --> 04:14.055
And both times he was behind
this 12-year-old girl, Kiki...

04:14.093 --> 04:15.720
- Kawana.
- Kawana.

04:15.761 --> 04:20.289
She was 13 and very big for her age.
Besides, I ran into some bad luck.

04:20.333 --> 04:23.928
What? Entering a race
where everyone else was better than you?

04:23.970 --> 04:26.370
Very funny. What are the odds on me?

04:26.405 --> 04:29.841
20 to... No, I'd better make 'em 30-1.

04:29.875 --> 04:32.435
Even though
I heard odds being quoted,

04:32.478 --> 04:35.743
I am, with abundant charity,
giving you the benefit of the doubt

04:35.781 --> 04:39.478
and assuming that this is not
a conversation about next week's race.

04:39.518 --> 04:44.546
- Of course not, Higgins.
- The race is a charity event.

04:44.590 --> 04:49.220
It would be a perversion of ethics and good
sportsmanship for money to change hands.

04:49.262 --> 04:53.164
- You're absolutely right, Higgie.
- Right.

04:55.167 --> 04:57.761
I'm off to the newsstand
to buy the Chronicle.

04:57.803 --> 05:00.636
Higgins, we sell the Island Chronicle
right in front.

05:00.673 --> 05:03.369
That pulp is an insult to journalism.

05:03.409 --> 05:07.778
When I refer to the Chronicle
I'm talking about the London Chronicle,

05:07.813 --> 05:09.940
delivered to Hawaii every Monday.

05:09.982 --> 05:13.145
Two weeks behind the civilized world,
I might add.

05:20.393 --> 05:22.918
- 200 on Kiyoki.
- Man, you won't regret it.

05:22.962 --> 05:24.987
Yes, you will. I'm gonna win.

05:25.031 --> 05:27.693
- Wanna bet?
- Bet? Bet?

05:27.733 --> 05:30.861
- Yeah, sure, I'll make a bet.
- How much?

05:30.903 --> 05:33.804
My entire life savings. $33.64.

05:33.839 --> 05:36.069
You're a big spender.

05:36.108 --> 05:38.668
Better hope that 13-year-old
girl doesn't enter.

05:38.711 --> 05:43.045
14. And I'm gonna win. Or die trying.

05:46.285 --> 05:49.584
- My God.
- Is something wrong, bro?

05:49.622 --> 05:52.455
Lord Wilkerson,
the Duke of Whitt, has passed on.

05:52.491 --> 05:55.517
Yeah? I got one brother named Duke.

05:57.029 --> 05:59.429
Please, just take care of your papers.

06:08.374 --> 06:10.342
And that's $5 even.

06:10.376 --> 06:12.810
Oh. Well...

06:12.845 --> 06:17.248
I'm afraid this is all I have.
Is that all right?

06:17.283 --> 06:19.478
I'm afraid not. This may be a British shop

06:19.518 --> 06:22.919
but we're in America
and I only take American currency.

06:22.955 --> 06:27.551
Er... Perhaps I can be of assistance. I...

06:28.994 --> 06:30.086
I...

06:32.231 --> 06:33.858
Yes?

06:33.899 --> 06:36.834
I would be happy to exchange the note.

06:36.869 --> 06:38.837
Fine.

06:38.871 --> 06:44.207
Let's see. The current rate of exchange
is roughly $1 .50 to the pound.

06:44.243 --> 06:47.474
That would be $7.50.

06:48.381 --> 06:51.350
I really am most grateful.
Thank you very much.

06:51.384 --> 06:53.579
That's quite...

06:53.619 --> 06:56.645
I mean... It's my pleasure.

07:03.095 --> 07:05.586
- Your order, Mr. Higgins.
- Thank you.

07:13.839 --> 07:16.569
Well, thank you again.

07:16.609 --> 07:18.668
Yes.

07:18.711 --> 07:21.976
Forgive me for perhaps
being too forward but I...

07:23.082 --> 07:27.212
I mean, I know you must be busy but I...

07:27.253 --> 07:30.654
- Well, I...
- Yes?

07:32.691 --> 07:35.717
It's been a pleasure to be of assistance.

07:47.640 --> 07:52.907
I beg your pardon. Hey, what are you doing?
What do you want with me?

07:52.945 --> 07:55.072
- Shut up and come with us.
- Let me go.

07:55.114 --> 07:57.810
What are you doing?

07:57.850 --> 08:01.786
Let me go, please! Please, let me go!

08:01.821 --> 08:04.813
- My God, what are you doing?
- Hold on. What are you doing?

08:04.857 --> 08:08.156
- None of your affair.
- Take your hands off me!

08:08.194 --> 08:09.855
Do as she asks.

08:11.030 --> 08:15.262
We're very serious. You stay out of this
or I'll beat your head on the wall.

08:18.337 --> 08:19.736
Halt!

08:21.106 --> 08:22.767
Let go of her. Now.

08:28.447 --> 08:30.677
Let's get out of here.

08:35.587 --> 08:38.022
Oh! Well...

08:39.357 --> 08:41.792
Thank you, sir. You saved me again.

08:41.827 --> 08:46.093
It was nothing, really.
Only cowards would try to accost a lady.

08:46.131 --> 08:48.827
I'm most grateful, Mr...

08:48.868 --> 08:51.701
Higgins. Jonathan Quayle Higgins.

08:51.737 --> 08:55.696
Vivien Brock Jones.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

08:55.741 --> 08:57.732
And mine.

08:57.776 --> 08:59.937
I can't remember when I was so frightened.

08:59.979 --> 09:04.507
They were British.
In the heat of battle, I didn't notice.

09:04.550 --> 09:07.883
- Yes, that is a coincidence.
- Quite.

09:07.920 --> 09:10.150
I'm so grateful that you came to my rescue.

09:10.189 --> 09:12.657
I'm a complete stranger here.

09:12.691 --> 09:14.784
I understand completely.

09:14.827 --> 09:18.695
At the risk of seeming bold,
I would like for you to...

09:18.731 --> 09:21.427
I mean, I think that you would like to...

09:23.869 --> 09:26.099
Please, just come with me.

09:38.050 --> 09:42.714
This is absolutely delightful.
Just like having tea at Brown's.

09:42.755 --> 09:45.519
One of the benefits
of being on the board of directors

09:45.558 --> 09:48.186
is that I can stock the kitchen
with things I like.

09:48.227 --> 09:52.789
Well, it's just what I needed.
I was beginning to feel very far from home.

09:52.831 --> 09:55.493
As honorary chairman
of the Sons of the Empire,

09:55.534 --> 09:58.697
I would consider it an honor
to help you adjust to the islands.

09:58.737 --> 10:01.570
Mr. Higgins, you really are very gallant.

10:03.309 --> 10:06.301
Have you a place to live?

10:06.345 --> 10:09.678
Well, as a matter of fact...

10:11.050 --> 10:13.575
This is really rather embarrassing.

10:13.619 --> 10:15.553
Anything that I can do to help...

10:16.889 --> 10:21.189
Well, I have a slight problem
at the moment with my finances.

10:21.226 --> 10:24.195
The committee has an emergency fund
for that.

10:24.229 --> 10:27.221
No, I didn't mean charity.

10:27.266 --> 10:31.965
What I was hoping was that
you might be able to advise me

10:32.004 --> 10:35.132
where I could sell this.

10:37.876 --> 10:41.004
And as a matter of fact...

10:44.483 --> 10:46.849
also these.

10:50.756 --> 10:52.383
Higgins!

10:55.027 --> 10:58.622
I'm glad I caught you.
I've got kind of a problem.

10:58.664 --> 11:01.394
Vivien Brock Jones, Thomas Magnum.

11:01.433 --> 11:05.733
- How do you do?
- Hi. I hope I'm not disturbing you.

11:05.771 --> 11:08.399
- As a matter of fact...
- Not at all. Won't you join us?

11:08.440 --> 11:10.635
I'm sure Magnum has things to do,

11:10.676 --> 11:13.941
like procuring a divorce for a blonde
and playing in the ocean.

11:13.979 --> 11:16.573
That is exactly
what I wanted to talk to you about.

11:16.615 --> 11:20.278
It's real important for me
to make a good showing in the race.

11:20.319 --> 11:22.685
Then run along and practice.

11:22.721 --> 11:27.818
That is what I was planning to do, but my
paddle, it's got a crack in the handle

11:27.860 --> 11:32.888
and I have to get it repaired or maybe
replaced, and since it's for the club...

11:32.931 --> 11:36.458
Look, it's got a tiny little hairline crack
right there.

11:36.502 --> 11:39.403
Why don't you just replace it?

11:41.974 --> 11:44.204
- You don't mind?
- Why would I mind?

11:44.243 --> 11:46.905
Great. Thanks, Higgins.

11:46.945 --> 11:48.674
Would you like a cup of tea?

11:50.716 --> 11:52.741
Please.

11:52.785 --> 11:56.084
All right. Oh, you've got those
cute little rolls that I like.

11:56.121 --> 11:59.249
- Those aren't cute rolls. They're scones.
- Mr. Higgins!

11:59.291 --> 12:00.849
Oh, my God.

12:02.494 --> 12:04.985
Higgins, these must be worth a fortune.

12:05.030 --> 12:07.828
Must you pry
into matters which don't concern you?

12:07.866 --> 12:09.857
It's all right. They're mine.

12:09.902 --> 12:14.862
But I find myself in the unfortunate
position of having to sell them.

12:14.907 --> 12:18.104
Gee...

12:18.143 --> 12:21.806
Well, if you really have to sell them,
I have a friend named Rick

12:21.847 --> 12:25.578
who could probably give you the best price,
don't you think?

12:25.617 --> 12:28.848
Do you think he could
find a buyer for this?

12:30.522 --> 12:32.387
I'll ask him.

12:32.424 --> 12:37.054
In the meantime, there must be another way
to resolve your financial dilemma.

12:37.096 --> 12:39.223
What about a job?

12:39.264 --> 12:41.528
A job? Magnum, really!

12:41.567 --> 12:46.163
That certainly would be a solution
but I'm afraid I have very limited skills.

12:46.205 --> 12:49.834
Higgins could find you one.
He's got all sorts of connections.

12:49.875 --> 12:51.775
Don't you think?

12:53.912 --> 12:55.436
Why...

12:56.348 --> 13:01.081
Perhaps Magnum, in his
usual blundering way,

13:01.120 --> 13:03.054
has hit upon something.

13:04.289 --> 13:09.056
My employer recently purchased
a collection of books from Sotheby's.

13:09.094 --> 13:11.824
It's my job to organize and catalog them.

13:11.864 --> 13:15.561
It's a terrible chore, one
I've been putting off.

13:15.601 --> 13:18.399
I mean, if you would like to...

13:18.437 --> 13:22.703
I mean, that is to say,
the two of us could...

13:22.741 --> 13:24.402
Er...

13:27.946 --> 13:30.437
I think he's offering you a job.

14:26.905 --> 14:29.100
Are you having some problems?

14:29.141 --> 14:31.837
I'll say. This bloody...

14:33.912 --> 14:36.005
My God.

14:37.049 --> 14:40.280
Perhaps we can be of some assistance.

14:40.319 --> 14:43.482
- Lady Wilkerson.
- Oh, no, none of that out here.

14:43.522 --> 14:48.050
- What's your name?
- Sergeant Major Jonathan Quayle Higgins.

14:48.093 --> 14:51.324
I was bringing supplies to my regiment
when it just quit on me.

14:51.363 --> 14:55.459
- I think it's a bad carburetor.
- We're on our way to the hospital.

14:55.500 --> 14:59.937
- Perhaps we could give you a lift.
- Oh, no, Your Grace.

14:59.972 --> 15:03.499
A little grease never bothered me.
Please let us help you.

15:03.542 --> 15:07.569
Really, Your Grace, I just couldn't.
I'd be most uncomfortable.

15:07.613 --> 15:10.047
Oh, very well. I understand.

15:10.082 --> 15:13.950
We could notify someone of your position.
They could send a tow truck.

15:13.986 --> 15:17.114
- That would be very kind.
- Very well.

15:17.155 --> 15:20.454
Good luck. Our thoughts
and best wishes are with you.

15:20.492 --> 15:24.622
Excuse me, but may I say
it's a privilege and an honor

15:24.663 --> 15:28.121
to serve such a gracious and kind lady
as the Duchess of Whitt.

15:28.166 --> 15:31.329
No, it is I who am privileged

15:31.370 --> 15:34.100
to have met a man
as brave and loyal as you.

15:53.759 --> 15:57.092
What in the bloody hell is she doing here?

16:01.715 --> 16:05.242
"My dear Lady Wilkerson,."

16:06.386 --> 16:09.184
"Duchess of Whitt."

16:12.559 --> 16:14.720
It's too formal.

16:21.334 --> 16:23.359
"My dear..."

16:27.941 --> 16:30.375
Dearest darling,

16:30.410 --> 16:33.470
the most lovely woman in creation.

16:36.249 --> 16:38.911
I don't want to scare her off.

16:40.854 --> 16:44.187
Damn, where is my wit when I need it most?

16:49.662 --> 16:53.826
"My dearest Vivien,."

16:55.535 --> 16:59.938
"It is only my deep and
sincere admiration..."

16:59.973 --> 17:03.272
<i>Charles Dickens, the complete set</i>.

17:03.309 --> 17:05.903
With, however,
The Old Curiosity Shop missing.

17:05.944 --> 17:12.441
The frontispiece is dated 18 <i>9</i> 0 but
the binding is new and imitation morocco.

17:12.484 --> 17:15.921
I'm afraid Mr. Masters
does have a taste for the obvious.

17:15.954 --> 17:18.890
It's absolutely fascinating,
such an education.

17:18.925 --> 17:21.553
And I'm actually being paid for helping.

17:24.130 --> 17:28.191
I've always loved books.
I've even considered writing one myself.

17:28.233 --> 17:31.203
Really? Fiction or non-fiction?

17:31.237 --> 17:33.831
Oh, fiction.

17:33.873 --> 17:36.433
I had this idea about a young girl

17:36.476 --> 17:41.106
who is well born
but of modest circumstances.

17:41.147 --> 17:44.708
- Sounds fascinating.
- And when she's 17

17:44.751 --> 17:51.748
she leaves school and marries
a much older man, a wealthy duke.

17:51.791 --> 17:54.157
Perhaps almost an arranged marriage.

17:55.128 --> 17:57.688
She must have an extraordinary
sense of duty.

17:57.730 --> 18:02.167
Possibly. Maybe she's just
not strong enough to object.

18:02.202 --> 18:05.660
In any case she comes
to respect her husband

18:05.705 --> 18:08.640
and indeed love him very much.

18:08.675 --> 18:12.406
But somehow she always feels like
somewhat of a prisoner,

18:12.445 --> 18:17.246
as though she's never had the chance
to experience life,

18:17.283 --> 18:19.274
find out what it has to offer.

18:20.653 --> 18:23.747
- And does she escape?
- Hi, Vivien.

18:23.790 --> 18:27.658
- How's the boss treating you?
- I'm having a wonderful time.

18:27.694 --> 18:30.026
Higgins can solve all your problems.

18:30.063 --> 18:33.191
- Does this interruption have any purpose?
- Oh, right.

18:33.233 --> 18:36.634
This came in the mail.
It must have been sent to me by mistake.

18:36.669 --> 18:40.730
Oh. Nice jacket. Real English tweed, huh?

18:40.773 --> 18:44.106
Oh, by the way, you friend Rick
got me a wonderful price on my ring,

18:44.144 --> 18:46.135
enough to pay for my new apartment.

18:46.179 --> 18:47.737
Great. I'm glad he could help.

18:47.780 --> 18:50.772
This appears to be a bill
for a new surf ski paddle.

18:50.817 --> 18:54.583
I told the guy at the store
to charge it to the club but...

18:54.621 --> 18:56.919
Oh, never mind. I'll take care of it.

18:58.491 --> 19:01.153
It is for charity.

19:03.396 --> 19:05.125
If that's all...

19:06.199 --> 19:08.759
Oh. Sure.

19:10.103 --> 19:12.469
- Bye, Vivien.
- Bye.

19:15.208 --> 19:17.608
He certainly is an engaging man.

19:18.344 --> 19:21.745
He must be overwhelmed
by available females.

19:21.781 --> 19:24.978
I suppose some women
might find him attractive,

19:25.018 --> 19:27.646
if they respond
to the more primitive elements.

19:31.224 --> 19:35.285
Here's a key so you can
enter the estate without calling.

19:35.328 --> 19:38.695
Since you'll be working here,
it will be more convenient.

19:38.731 --> 19:41.564
I'll been a wonderful day,
and I'll see you tomorrow.

19:41.601 --> 19:44.365
- Or sooner.
- I beg your pardon?

19:44.404 --> 19:47.305
Nothing. Just goodbye for now.

20:06.693 --> 20:10.595
<i>" My dearest Vivien.
It is only my deep and sincere admiration</i>

20:10.630 --> 20:14.760
<i>" that gives me the courage to tell you
how moved I am by your courage.</i>

20:14.801 --> 20:19.761
<i>" We must all seize life when rare opportunity
presents itself, as I must do now</i>.

20:19.806 --> 20:23.435
<i>" If I can hope that you could possibly
have any feelings for me,</i>

20:23.476 --> 20:28.504
<i>"come to the estate at eight tonight
for a romantic dinner. ".</i>

21:09.956 --> 21:14.689
<i>There"s a long pop to deep right-field,
way back. It"s outta herel.</i>

21:14.727 --> 21:17.753
<i>And the White Sox lead one to nothing</i>.

21:17.797 --> 21:21.130
<i>Johnson will need a home run
at the top of the first inning,</i>

21:21.167 --> 21:23.829
<i>there"s no doubt about it</i>.

21:26.673 --> 21:29.801
Come in.

21:36.316 --> 21:37.544
Good evening.

21:37.583 --> 21:39.244
Hi.

21:40.653 --> 21:42.086
Come on in.

21:50.563 --> 21:53.464
- Would you like a hot dog?
- A hot dog?

21:53.499 --> 21:56.229
That sounds wonderful.
I've never had one before.

21:59.972 --> 22:03.100
<i>Swings the next pitch and
lies it to left field</i>.

22:03.142 --> 22:05.474
I see you like to live very casually.

22:05.511 --> 22:06.842
<i>Makes the catch</i>.

22:06.879 --> 22:09.245
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

22:09.282 --> 22:13.514
Oh, no, I admire it. I
think it's very masculine.

22:17.390 --> 22:21.087
I'm sorry. Do you want some chili
on your hot dog?

22:21.127 --> 22:22.389
Why not?

22:26.065 --> 22:28.124
<i>By the way, Jim is</i>...

22:28.167 --> 22:33.628
Oh, I'm sorry. Just clear some of
that stuff and take a seat there.

22:33.673 --> 22:36.198
There's a great game on.

22:36.242 --> 22:39.678
<i>"Here's Jim, he swings
and he misses for strike one.</i>

23:08.274 --> 23:10.606
<i>Checking with his third-base coaches</i>...

23:10.643 --> 23:13.271
Why does that man
keep scratching like that?

23:13.312 --> 23:18.443
- <i>This is an ideal time</i>...
- He's not scratching, he's giving signals.

23:18.484 --> 23:24.548
He's trying to tell the batter -
the guy standing at the plate - what to do.

23:25.758 --> 23:27.282
Fascinating.

23:27.326 --> 23:31.990
<i>Swings away at the first pitch
and barrels it down the right-field line.</i>

23:33.332 --> 23:37.428
- You really love this game, don't you?
- Yeah.

23:39.972 --> 23:44.909
When I was a kid, all I dreamed about was
becoming a Major League baseball player.

23:44.944 --> 23:48.311
What happened?

23:49.048 --> 23:51.676
- I grew up.
- That shouldn't stop you.

23:51.717 --> 23:54.345
You can always go after your dreams.

23:54.387 --> 23:56.548
It's too late.

23:57.356 --> 24:00.985
You only live once. It's never too
late to go after what you want.

24:01.027 --> 24:06.090
It is for me. I'm 38 years old. There's very
few guys in the Major Leagues left my age.

24:07.133 --> 24:10.159
Besides, I could never hit
a high inside fast ball.

24:11.504 --> 24:13.404
Anyway, I'm happy doing what I do.

24:14.006 --> 24:16.236
- Are you really?
- Yeah.

24:16.275 --> 24:18.573
I like being a private investigator.

24:18.611 --> 24:21.102
I'm good at it. I help people.

24:21.147 --> 24:23.513
<i>Here comes Barridge, rounding third</i>...

24:23.549 --> 24:28.646
- I see your point.
- ..<i>Opposite field double by Larry Hearndonl</i>

24:37.396 --> 24:42.629
I was dreaming, lads. Deluding myself.

24:42.668 --> 24:46.866
To think that a lady of her stature
could consider a man like me.

24:48.708 --> 24:52.906
Knowing your station in life.
That's the secret to happiness, lads.

24:54.146 --> 24:56.876
Otherwise it's dashed hopes.

25:04.056 --> 25:08.186
My God, will he turn down
that infernal noise?

25:13.900 --> 25:17.802
- Ah. You sure you don't want a glass?
- No, no, this is fine.

25:17.837 --> 25:20.601
- OK. There you are.
- Thank you. Cheers.

25:22.742 --> 25:26.610
- You're terrific.
- Magnum, will you ple...

25:30.049 --> 25:33.212
Hi, Higgins.
What are you all dressed up for?

25:34.720 --> 25:37.120
Jonathan, you look magnificent.

25:37.156 --> 25:39.920
Come in. Sit down. How about a chili dog?

25:39.959 --> 25:42.257
I...

25:43.462 --> 25:46.795
<i>There it goesl Deep to left fieldl.</i>

25:46.832 --> 25:49.824
<i>Going, going, goodbyel.</i>

25:53.737 --> 25:58.003
<i>I had seen Higgins mad before,
I had seen him crazed with fury,</i>

25:58.041 --> 26:01.204
<i>but I had never seen him
at a loss for words.</i>

26:16.093 --> 26:18.755
Higgins, what did you want before?

26:18.796 --> 26:21.993
- Where's Vivien?
- I drove her home.

26:22.032 --> 26:25.695
- How could you?
- What, drive her home?

26:25.736 --> 26:30.230
- The buses don't run this late.
- How could you betray me? And her.

26:30.274 --> 26:35.712
Using my... My God, the irony.
The bitter, perfect, poetic irony.

26:35.746 --> 26:38.271
Using my own letter to steal her from me.

26:42.152 --> 26:43.551
What letter?

26:43.587 --> 26:47.648
The letter I wrote her explaining my
feelings and inviting her to dinner.

26:47.691 --> 26:50.251
I fixed pheasant.

26:50.294 --> 26:54.788
- I don't know anything about a letter.
- Then what was Vivien doing at your place?

26:56.233 --> 26:57.894
Oh.

26:59.336 --> 27:01.395
Oh... Well...

27:01.438 --> 27:04.236
She must have thought that I...

27:04.274 --> 27:06.799
But how could she?

27:10.013 --> 27:12.243
I didn't sign it.

27:12.282 --> 27:15.581
I couldn't bring myself to.

27:15.619 --> 27:18.588
Obviously she preferred
thinking it came from you.

27:18.622 --> 27:23.389
Gee... I'm sorry, Higgins.
I mean, if I knew...

27:23.427 --> 27:28.763
Vivien is a lovely woman
but romantically she means nothing to me.

27:29.433 --> 27:34.496
Nothing? This gentlewoman bestows upon
you her affection and you call it nothing?

27:34.538 --> 27:37.837
That's not what I meant.
She's not interested in me.

27:37.875 --> 27:41.106
It was your letter. Just
explain the mix-up.

27:41.144 --> 27:43.669
I'd rather face a firing squad.

27:45.616 --> 27:47.743
It's you she wants.

27:47.784 --> 27:52.187
She'd be humiliated
if she discovered how she was misled.

27:55.025 --> 27:59.928
- Then what do we do?
- She's fragile. Her feelings are tender.

27:59.963 --> 28:03.160
I'm meeting her at the Club tomorrow
to get some of her jewels.

28:03.200 --> 28:05.464
I'll go with you.

28:05.502 --> 28:09.495
When we see her we must act
as if we never had this conversation.

28:09.539 --> 28:12.372
- Do you understand?
- No.

28:13.543 --> 28:16.410
But I'll go along with it.

28:29.960 --> 28:31.928
Thank you.

28:35.399 --> 28:37.697
- Good morning, Jonathan.
- Good morning.

28:37.734 --> 28:39.998
- Good morning, Thomas.
- Morning.

28:40.037 --> 28:42.665
I want to thank you
for a wonderful evening.

28:42.706 --> 28:45.197
I had such a marvelous time.

28:45.242 --> 28:51.044
Yes, me too. I have to go sign up for
the race, then I have to practice so...

28:51.081 --> 28:54.448
May I come and watch you?
I'd love to see you in action.

28:54.484 --> 28:57.612
I believe you needed some of your jewels.

28:57.654 --> 29:00.020
Oh. Yes, of course.

29:00.324 --> 29:02.656
Er... This way.

29:06.496 --> 29:10.023
Jonathan! Ahh! Ohh!

29:10.067 --> 29:12.729
Don't even consider it.

29:29.219 --> 29:31.414
Are you all right? Come on.

29:31.455 --> 29:33.184
Come on.

29:42.566 --> 29:48.061
<i>"Sure. I know. It's crazy to refer
to what Higgins and I share as friendship.</i>

29:48.105 --> 29:51.666
<i>But it is. We bite and bicker
like an old married couple</i>

29:51.708 --> 29:57.010
<i>but mixed in with the</i> j <i>ibes</i>
<i>is a funny kind of mutual trust</i>.

29:57.047 --> 30:00.710
<i>When Higgins saw Vivien at my place
he felt I had betrayed that trust,</i>

30:00.751 --> 30:04.187
<i>but of course the kidnapping
had made that all very unimportant.</i>

30:04.221 --> 30:08.157
<i>At least the funny trust was back.
And we both knew it.</i>

30:08.191 --> 30:10.022
Higgins?

30:11.495 --> 30:15.556
Higgins... we tried to find the car.

30:15.599 --> 30:20.298
Rick and I checked the waterfront, Hotel
Street. The usual places. Nothing so far.

30:21.738 --> 30:24.400
I should have been able to stop them.

30:24.441 --> 30:27.274
There was nothing you could do.
The guys had guns.

30:27.310 --> 30:29.244
You did all you could.

30:29.279 --> 30:32.771
- I think we ought to call the police.
- No, Magnum, please.

30:32.816 --> 30:36.513
There's been a message from her abductors.
We're to wait for their call.

30:36.553 --> 30:38.544
The police should know about this.

30:38.588 --> 30:43.025
No. There's something else you don't know.
Vivian is not as she appears.

30:43.060 --> 30:46.427
Not at all the poor matron without means.

30:46.463 --> 30:48.624
Magnum, she is of the Realm.

30:51.201 --> 30:54.432
- Royalty?
- By marriage, yes. Lady Wilkerson.

30:54.471 --> 30:56.371
Wife of the late Duke of Whitt.

30:56.406 --> 30:58.601
So we just sit here and wait?

30:59.743 --> 31:04.009
I spoke to her brother-in-law this evening.
The new Duke of Whitt.

31:04.047 --> 31:07.016
Very strange conversation. I was shocked.

31:07.050 --> 31:10.542
He seemed more concerned
with the jewels than her.

31:10.587 --> 31:13.613
- How much are they worth?
- I didn't examine the items.

31:13.657 --> 31:16.148
My only concern was their safekeeping.

31:16.193 --> 31:17.888
But they must be quite valuable

31:17.928 --> 31:21.830
or he wouldn't have been so bloody adamant
about my not giving them up.

31:21.865 --> 31:26.097
- What a guy.
- I can live without your flippant humor.

31:31.341 --> 31:35.334
Lord Wilkerson is arranging
for an alternate form of payment.

31:35.378 --> 31:37.812
I will inform them of that when they call.

31:37.848 --> 31:42.683
And you're just gonna sit there sipping
brandy, being terribly British?

31:42.719 --> 31:44.277
Yes!

31:52.229 --> 31:54.288
Are you familiar with London at all?

31:55.632 --> 31:58.066
A few times when I was in the navy. Why?

31:58.101 --> 31:59.659
The Strand?

32:00.871 --> 32:03.135
- Movie house?
- No, Magnum.

32:03.173 --> 32:05.038
It's a very famous street in London,

32:05.075 --> 32:07.771
renowned for men's clothes and restaurants.

32:08.745 --> 32:12.442
There's a particular little tea shop there.

32:12.482 --> 32:16.077
Forgive me.
I forget that you find my stories tedious.

32:16.119 --> 32:18.781
I'm listening, Higgins. Go on.

32:20.891 --> 32:22.882
It's a quaint little place.

32:22.926 --> 32:28.387
I've always thought it curious that I
should visit it at that particular moment.

32:30.233 --> 32:34.192
<i>I suppose you can"t really comprehend</i>
<i>the</i> j <i>oy that an Englishman experiences</i>

32:34.237 --> 32:38.298
<i>in taking tea in the Strand
after being away for a long time.</i>

32:38.341 --> 32:41.708
<i>It"s roughly comparable</i>
<i>to the en</i> j <i>oyment you seem to derive</i>

32:41.745 --> 32:46.409
<i>from munching a hot dog
or watching a baseball game on television.</i>

32:47.217 --> 32:51.711
<i>There was a hint of sadness, perhaps,
seeing as how I was there alone.</i>

32:51.755 --> 32:54.781
<i>At any rate,
I happened to look across the room,</i>

32:54.824 --> 33:00.194
<i>and Vivien was at a table by herself,
looking very radiant.</i>

33:00.230 --> 33:04.098
<i>We had met once, but only in the
most official of situations</i>.

33:04.134 --> 33:05.658
<i>While I am not a commoner,</i>

33:05.702 --> 33:09.365
<i>still I was aware of the difference
in our stations in life.</i>

33:09.406 --> 33:14.343
<i>For me to suddenly bound over to her table</i>
<i>and ask to</i> j <i>oin her in tea</i>...

33:14.377 --> 33:18.939
<i>And yet, I had this
overpowering compulsion to do so,</i>

33:18.982 --> 33:25.114
<i>if only</i> j <i>ust to remind her that</i>
<i>she had once been very, very kind to me</i>.

33:25.155 --> 33:27.646
<i>I made my decision to speak to her</i>.

33:27.691 --> 33:30.819
<i>I was overstepping
some measure of etiquette, I knew,</i>

33:30.860 --> 33:33.852
<i>but I simply found that
I couldn"t stop myself</i>.

33:33.897 --> 33:39.130
<i>Just at that moment, she was</i> j <i>oined</i>
<i>by her husband, the Duke of Whitt</i>.

33:40.070 --> 33:42.868
<i>They were very loving to each other</i>.

33:46.409 --> 33:49.344
<i>I left without finishing my tea</i>.

33:51.481 --> 33:54.006
That's it? The whole story?

33:55.986 --> 34:00.423
Forgive me.
I hoped that you would understand.

34:00.457 --> 34:02.584
Yeah, I guess I...

34:02.626 --> 34:07.029
I failed to remember that the ways
of a gentleman are patently foreign to you.

34:07.063 --> 34:11.898
I revere words like honor, integrity, chivalry,
words that are not in your vocabulary.

34:11.935 --> 34:13.664
Higgins, enough.

34:13.703 --> 34:17.230
Knocking my rubber chicken
or my sloppy habits is within the rules,

34:17.274 --> 34:19.833
but you're attacking my character.

34:21.444 --> 34:23.605
I would like to think you don't mean that.

34:26.616 --> 34:28.174
Yes, I'm sorry.

34:30.353 --> 34:33.618
You can't know what it's like
to care deeply for someone

34:33.657 --> 34:37.559
and have your hope taken.

34:38.527 --> 34:40.496
Yes, I can.

34:47.570 --> 34:50.437
- Yes?
- <i>The name is Wilkes, sir. We"ve met</i>.

34:50.473 --> 34:55.137
<i>I have information regarding the Duchess</i>.
<i>Bring the</i> j <i>ewels to Lunalilo Bridge</i>.

34:55.178 --> 34:58.079
- It will take me some time to...
- <i>You better leave now</i>.

34:58.114 --> 35:00.378
Wait! Wait! Hello!

35:09.426 --> 35:11.485
I told you to bring the jewels.

35:11.528 --> 35:15.555
If I go back empty-handed,
it'll go very badly with the Duchess.

35:15.598 --> 35:17.532
I'm trying to explain to you.

35:17.567 --> 35:20.502
I've spoken to the Duchess' brother-in-law.

35:20.537 --> 35:23.028
He's agreeable to a cash payment.

35:23.073 --> 35:26.065
He may be agreeable
but Mr. Graham and I are not.

35:26.109 --> 35:30.842
If it was only money we wanted, we would
have stayed in Lord Wilkerson's employ.

35:30.880 --> 35:33.508
But of course you wouldn't know about that.

35:33.550 --> 35:36.986
He hired us to fetch her back to England.

35:37.020 --> 35:42.287
But a few hundred pounds' fee cannot
compare with three million in jewels.

35:42.325 --> 35:47.490
- We're not playing games. If you don't...
- Mr. Wilkes, please.

35:47.530 --> 35:51.159
You'll have the jewels.
There's no reason to harm Lady Wilkerson.

35:51.201 --> 35:54.500
I just need a little time
to collect them. An hour.

35:55.405 --> 35:58.374
- Last chance.
- I assure you.

35:58.408 --> 36:03.038
One hour then.
At the corner of Hotel and Lillier.

36:03.079 --> 36:07.311
Please be punctual. And alone.

36:21.030 --> 36:22.622
If Rick finds us here...

36:22.665 --> 36:25.725
No one is to know
we've spoken to the kidnappers.

36:25.769 --> 36:27.669
Those guys aren't gonna play fair.

36:27.704 --> 36:30.036
I have no choice but to go along with it.

36:30.073 --> 36:32.371
I think you're wrong.
Let me get Rick and T.C.

36:32.409 --> 36:38.507
No. Don't you understand?
They were very explicit. I'm to come alone.

36:40.316 --> 36:42.614
Wait a minute.

36:42.652 --> 36:46.645
You're not going without me. Higgins?

36:47.424 --> 36:50.325
Alright. But no one else. No one.

37:01.471 --> 37:03.962
You really think they're
worth three million?

37:09.078 --> 37:11.308
What is it?

37:13.016 --> 37:16.850
Perhaps I should have inspected them
more carefully before.

37:18.254 --> 37:20.779
What is it?

37:23.893 --> 37:27.260
The whole lot's worth
only a few thousand dollars.

37:27.297 --> 37:28.628
What?

37:30.400 --> 37:33.096
Magnum, these jewels aren't real.

37:33.136 --> 37:36.936
They're nothing more than
very well-made paste.

37:46.580 --> 37:49.893
- Where are they leading us?
- They're headed for the wharf.

37:49.918 --> 37:53.075
- I don't like it.
- Just be prepared for anything.

37:53.120 --> 37:57.523
- Oh, no. I think my foot's gone to sleep.
- For God's sake, Magnum.

37:57.557 --> 38:00.754
It's not my fault.
I've been cramped up in the back... Aaah!

38:00.794 --> 38:03.490
Put your head down.
Do you want them to see you?

38:03.530 --> 38:06.727
I can't help it. I got a charlie horse.

38:09.736 --> 38:14.696
Higgins, what will they do
when they find out the jewels are phony?

38:14.741 --> 38:16.936
They won't find out. I won't let them.

38:31.124 --> 38:34.821
- He's pulling up next to a boat.
- Get close to the water.

38:34.861 --> 38:36.761
I'll get as close as I can.

39:06.059 --> 39:08.653
This is far enough.

39:15.735 --> 39:18.431
- You feel the need for protection?
- Our crew.

39:18.472 --> 39:22.135
We've rented the gentleman's boat
to take us to Tahiti.

39:22.175 --> 39:25.838
- Those jewels now if you don't mind.
- Not until you present the Duchess.

39:25.879 --> 39:30.782
I've talked nicely, Mr. Higgins.
If you choose to renege on our agreement,

39:30.817 --> 39:36.312
then I shall be obliged to take the box
and let these boys have a go at you.

39:36.356 --> 39:39.484
Forgive me for not being
frightfully intimidated,

39:39.526 --> 39:44.156
but I have no fear of harm until you are
satisfied that these are the jewels you want.

39:44.197 --> 39:47.325
- Give me that box!
- Bring Lady Wilkerson to the deck.

39:47.367 --> 39:49.460
You drop those and you're a dead man.

39:49.503 --> 39:53.769
Be that as it may,
you will still have lost your fortune.

39:53.807 --> 39:56.469
Graham, fetch her out here!

40:02.215 --> 40:05.480
- Are you all right, Your Grace?
- Yes, Jonathan.

40:09.189 --> 40:13.387
Yes. As you say, we must be sure
that these are the genuine article.

40:13.426 --> 40:15.394
Magnum!

40:25.739 --> 40:27.707
Vivien, get off the boat!

40:50.830 --> 40:52.491
Your turn.

41:08.582 --> 41:10.777
- Magnum, look out!
- Aaah!

41:27.901 --> 41:31.064
- Oh, thank you, Thomas.
- No, Vivien, wait.

41:31.104 --> 41:34.938
Don't thank me. Thank Higgins.
He planned the whole rescue.

41:34.975 --> 41:38.411
Thank you, Jonathan.

41:38.445 --> 41:42.279
We must all seize life
when the rare opportunity presents itself.

41:42.315 --> 41:47.048
- Isn't that what you said in your letter?
- You weren't listening. It was Higgins.

41:47.087 --> 41:51.490
I was listening. To the modest words
of a brave and gracious man.

42:15.515 --> 42:17.107
<i>As I neared the finish line,</i>

42:17.150 --> 42:21.018
<i>the phrase about winning the battle
and losing the war came to mind.</i>

42:21.054 --> 42:25.787
<i>"If I deliberately lost the race, Vivien's
misplaced hero worship might wane,</i>

42:25.825 --> 42:28.350
<i>and she might see Higgins
with clearer eyes</i>.

42:28.395 --> 42:33.560
<i>But as Higgins said, words like
honor and integrity are important</i>.

42:33.600 --> 42:36.535
<i>I had to try to win</i>.

43:14.741 --> 43:18.336
- 17th! Thomas, you were 17th!
- Way to go, man!

43:18.378 --> 43:22.109
That's a lot better than last year.
Let me massage those sore arms.

43:22.148 --> 43:25.879
That was absolutely wonderful.
I knew you could do it.

43:25.919 --> 43:28.251
I only finished 17th.

43:28.288 --> 43:33.248
But last year you came in 62nd.
That's a magnificent improvement.

43:33.293 --> 43:36.626
Yeah, but I really wanted that trophy.

43:36.663 --> 43:41.259
I mean I really wanted... Oh, forget it.

43:41.301 --> 43:46.034
I mean, what's a trophy anyway?
Can it boogie?

43:46.072 --> 43:49.564
17th place is still good enough
to get the chicks, right, guys?

43:49.609 --> 43:52.100
The chicks?

43:53.446 --> 43:58.383
Hey, dig my action over there.
They are already starting to congregate.

44:02.388 --> 44:06.017
I'm sorry, but excuse me,
that's the price you pay.

44:06.993 --> 44:08.722
- Thomas.
- Yeah?

44:08.762 --> 44:13.927
I thought perhaps we might have another
quiet dinner to celebrate your achievement.

44:13.967 --> 44:19.200
Hey, what can I say? I'm gonna be into
this heavy party thing the rest of the day

44:19.239 --> 44:21.935
and like you said, I was pretty impressive.

44:21.975 --> 44:24.944
Lunch tomorrow? Maybe, OK?

44:24.978 --> 44:29.642
Rick, would you take care of my surf ski?
Love ya. Gotta run.

44:29.682 --> 44:33.743
Catch you back at the hacienda, Big Hig.

44:33.787 --> 44:35.516
Big Hig?

44:41.728 --> 44:44.128
Hi, girls.

44:44.164 --> 44:46.496
Wait a minute! I finished 17th!

44:46.533 --> 44:48.433
Is he all right?

44:48.468 --> 44:53.337
It's obviously oxygen narcosis
from his exertion in the race.

44:57.177 --> 45:01.341
Honestly, Vivien, this is quite
uncharacteristic behavior for Magnum.

45:01.381 --> 45:03.474
Yes, of course.

45:24.003 --> 45:27.632
My husband always suspected
Eric's weakness of character.

45:27.674 --> 45:32.941
You couldn't know he'd stolen
the jewels and replaced them with copies.

45:32.979 --> 45:36.938
All I can do is pity him,
go back home, assume my duties.

45:38.985 --> 45:42.250
May I present you with a goodbye gift?

45:52.165 --> 45:53.826
Oh.

45:55.568 --> 45:58.969
That piece of your jewelry
is indeed the genuine article.

46:00.139 --> 46:03.108
And so are you.

46:16.055 --> 46:18.546
Will you come and visit
me in England, please?

46:18.591 --> 46:21.492
Indeed. I would be honored. Bye.

46:21.527 --> 46:24.223
Viv! Vivien!

46:26.199 --> 46:28.190
Darn it. I missed her.

46:28.234 --> 46:30.896
I wanted to say goodbye.

46:33.740 --> 46:36.300
You deliberately missed Vivian's departure,

46:36.342 --> 46:39.607
just as you deliberately acted
like an ass on the beach.

46:40.914 --> 46:43.144
Of course.

46:47.921 --> 46:50.219
You know that letter you wrote to Vivien?

46:50.256 --> 46:54.420
It was such a success, I was wondering
if you could knock one off for me,

46:54.460 --> 46:56.155
unsigned, of course.

46:56.195 --> 46:59.653
You see, I wouldn't ask except
I've got this friend...

47:00.266 --> 47:02.928
Well, to begin at the beginning,

47:02.969 --> 47:06.302
I was on my third tour of duty in Vietnam

47:06.339 --> 47:09.467
and a classmate of mine,
Richie Dalrymple-White,

47:09.509 --> 47:11.704
had been missing in action for some time...
