00:00.300 --> 00:01.701
Amy: Previously on "Heartland"...

00:01.736 --> 00:03.903
Jesse:
I've got the one thing that you both need.

00:03.937 --> 00:06.515
Capital. Liquidity. Cold hard cash.

00:06.535 --> 00:09.042
Ty: The last thing you wanna do is
go into business with Jesse Stanton.

00:09.076 --> 00:11.244
- Ty: (Hard punch) Oh!
- Cass: Jesse!

00:11.278 --> 00:14.514
Peter: I feel like I'm outside
this family looking in.

00:14.548 --> 00:16.616
You're away so much that you feel left out,

00:16.650 --> 00:20.218
and because you feel left
out you stay away longer.

00:21.025 --> 00:25.725
You're the same girl that I
fell in love with... and more.

00:25.745 --> 00:30.256
Because you have changed...
and in a great way.

00:31.652 --> 00:33.265
(Kissing)

00:33.299 --> 00:34.800
You're getting married... aren't you?

00:34.834 --> 00:37.136
(Gasps) You are, aren't you?!

00:37.170 --> 00:38.704
- Amy and Ty: (Laughing) Yes.
- Jack: For real this time?

00:38.738 --> 00:42.274
Ty: Yeah. For real.

00:42.308 --> 00:44.009
Ty: Okay, you ready?
Amy: (Laughing)

00:44.044 --> 00:46.611
Ty: Oh yeah.

00:46.646 --> 00:48.213
(Camera clicks repeatedly)

00:48.247 --> 00:49.914
Ty: Now that says "save the date."

00:49.948 --> 00:53.351
Amy: This is about us getting married,
not the scenery.

00:53.386 --> 00:55.387
Ty: Okay, a couple more,
then I gotta go to work, okay?

00:55.421 --> 00:57.088
Amy: All right. Oh, that's better.

00:57.122 --> 00:59.123
Ty: Yeah? (Camera clicks) Hey, I like that.

00:59.158 --> 01:00.792
All right. Now we're getting somewhere.

01:00.826 --> 01:03.061
- Ty: Up up!
- That definitely says "save the date."

01:03.095 --> 01:06.931
(Camera clicks repeatedly) Both: Oops!
Whoa! (Laughing)

01:06.965 --> 01:08.666
- Ty: You think we got it?
- Amy: Mm-mm. Not yet.

01:08.701 --> 01:11.268
(Camera clicks)

01:11.303 --> 01:13.270
Ty: (Growls playfully)
Amy: (Laughs)

01:17.609 --> 01:20.644
- Lou: Brought you a coffee.
- Peter: Thank you.

01:20.679 --> 01:22.346
(Light kiss)

01:22.380 --> 01:24.815
Lou: How's your report going?

01:24.849 --> 01:26.983
Peter: Uh... good, good. It's fine.

01:27.018 --> 01:29.824
Lou: Hmm... interesting.

01:31.089 --> 01:34.024
- Peter: What? Why?
- Lou: Nothing. I...

01:34.058 --> 01:36.026
I was just thinking...

01:36.060 --> 01:38.261
You know,
if you can get your work done from here,

01:38.295 --> 01:40.463
maybe we can make it permanent?

01:40.497 --> 01:42.099
When I'm here, I'm totally out of the loop.

01:42.133 --> 01:43.834
Well, this is Calgary.

01:43.868 --> 01:46.036
I mean, there are lots of other jobs.

01:46.070 --> 01:48.772
Maybe that's something we should...
explore.

01:48.806 --> 01:50.941
(Sighs) I can't, Lou... I...
I can't do this right now.

01:50.975 --> 01:54.577
I got way too much on my plate already,
okay? Please.

01:54.612 --> 01:56.646
Georgie: All right you guys, I've gotta go.

01:56.680 --> 01:58.414
Lou: Hey, don't forget you have a
trick riding lesson after school,

01:58.449 --> 02:00.483
and I have some errands to
run and your dad's busy,

02:00.517 --> 02:02.619
so I'm gonna need you to watch Katie too,
okay?

02:02.653 --> 02:03.853
Georgie:
But I still need to muck out the barn,

02:03.887 --> 02:06.289
and I haven't ridden Phoenix in two days!

02:06.323 --> 02:08.384
Lou: Well, you're gonna have to
make some time for your sister too.

02:08.405 --> 02:10.158
(Screen door shuts)

02:10.193 --> 02:12.594
Jack: Oh,
just the person I wanna talk to...

02:12.629 --> 02:15.097
Lou: Grandpa? I thought you
were staying at Lisa's tonight?

02:15.132 --> 02:16.613
Jack: Well, that was the plan,
but things change.

02:16.633 --> 02:19.802
That barn is a mess.
What happened to doing your chores?

02:19.836 --> 02:21.904
Georgie: Okay, I'll...
I'll do it after school, okay?

02:21.938 --> 02:23.438
I promise. I've gotta go.

02:23.473 --> 02:24.873
- Bye!
- Lou: Bye!

02:28.110 --> 02:29.478
Jack: What?

02:32.114 --> 02:33.382
Peter: Trouble in paradise?

02:33.416 --> 02:36.918
(Phone rings)

02:39.656 --> 02:42.323
(Phone beeps) Lou: Hello?

02:42.357 --> 02:43.624
No, I'm sorry she's not home right now.

02:43.659 --> 02:46.127
Can I take a message?

02:46.162 --> 02:48.596
Yes. Yes, of course.

02:48.630 --> 02:51.399
I will get her to call you back right away!

02:51.433 --> 02:54.502
Okay.

02:54.536 --> 02:56.838
Thank you for calling.

02:56.872 --> 02:58.939
Bye, bye. (Phone beeps)

02:58.973 --> 03:00.775
Peter: Who's that?

03:00.809 --> 03:03.996
No one. Just a client for Amy.

03:06.506 --> 03:09.249
Caleb: The next day, I lucked into
this awesome bronc called brain damage.

03:09.284 --> 03:11.185
Managed to stay on for 8 seconds,

03:11.219 --> 03:14.188
score went through the roof... Boom!

03:14.222 --> 03:16.723
Cass and Caleb: (Laughing flirtatiously)
Caleb: Yeah.

03:16.757 --> 03:19.092
Ty: Caleb. What're you doing here?

03:19.127 --> 03:21.195
Well, I was... hoping to catch you.

03:21.229 --> 03:23.163
We got some business to discuss.

03:23.198 --> 03:24.965
Yeah, well, uh... maybe some other time.

03:24.999 --> 03:26.867
I got a ton of work to do.

03:26.901 --> 03:28.969
Besides, you've been on the rodeo
circuit for... a couple of weeks now,

03:29.003 --> 03:31.404
I don't know what business
we have to discuss.

03:31.439 --> 03:34.808
All right, well,
if that's the way you want it, fine.

03:34.842 --> 03:37.444
- Bye, Cass.
- Cass: Yeah, see ya.

03:37.478 --> 03:39.245
(Receding footsteps)

03:39.279 --> 03:41.013
(Cat meows nearby,
dogs bark in the distance)

03:41.048 --> 03:42.949
What's your problem?

03:42.983 --> 03:46.453
Ty: No problem. Just... you and Caleb.

03:46.487 --> 03:49.968
Cass: (Laughs) He came here to see you, Ty.

03:51.358 --> 03:54.994
Guess who called you? Tanner Gunn!

03:55.028 --> 03:56.595
He wants to know if you
can work with his horse!

03:56.629 --> 03:58.564
I'm sorry, who's Tanner Gunn?

03:58.598 --> 04:00.632
Tanner Gunn?! He-he owns that
huge place near black diamond,

04:00.667 --> 04:02.235
big Gunn ranch.

04:02.269 --> 04:04.370
Oh, so like a rich weekend cowboy?

04:04.404 --> 04:06.605
Yeah, I mean he's huge in the oil business.

04:06.639 --> 04:08.974
Anyway, he has a working cow horse

04:09.008 --> 04:11.943
and he wants to know if you
can help him out with it.

04:11.978 --> 04:14.980
No. I'm sorry, that's...
just not what I do anymore.

04:15.014 --> 04:16.648
A guy like that definitely
doesn't need my help.

04:16.683 --> 04:19.411
- Lou: What?!
- Amy: Lou, forget it.

04:22.454 --> 04:25.090
Wait.
Amy, just... (Screen door creaks open)

04:25.124 --> 04:27.058
Come on! I mean, this is a job.

04:27.093 --> 04:29.394
What's-what's wrong with you?

04:29.428 --> 04:32.397
Amy: Nothing! In fact,
ever since I got back from Pike River,

04:32.431 --> 04:33.899
everything's been great.

04:33.933 --> 04:35.934
I've finally got my priorities straight.

04:35.968 --> 04:38.603
Lou: And your priorities don't
include working for Tanner Gunn?

04:38.637 --> 04:41.238
Lou, there are plenty of
other horse trainers out there

04:41.273 --> 04:43.508
and he can afford to hire any one of them.

04:43.542 --> 04:45.075
I wanna work with horses
that actually need my help.

04:45.110 --> 04:47.845
Okay. Okay. I-I respect your choice,

04:47.880 --> 04:50.218
but I still need you
to call him right away.

04:50.238 --> 04:51.783
Why?

04:51.817 --> 04:54.684
Because this long distance thing with
me and Peter isn't working anymore!

04:54.719 --> 04:57.021
Well, I'm sorry,

04:57.055 --> 04:58.722
but what does that have
to do with Tanner Gunn?

04:58.756 --> 05:01.392
Peter used to know him... sort of.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.260
Look, if Peter could get a job in Calgary,

05:03.295 --> 05:05.595
our biggest problem would be solved,

05:05.630 --> 05:08.265
and Tanner Gunn is the perfect
guy to make that happen.

05:08.300 --> 05:10.266
Why don't you just talk to Peter about it?

05:10.301 --> 05:12.035
Lou: Don't you think I haven't tried?

05:12.069 --> 05:14.003
Every time I do, he just avoids the issue.

05:14.038 --> 05:16.239
I can't get anywhere, so...

05:16.273 --> 05:19.543
promise me you won't mention it to him.

05:19.577 --> 05:22.211
Come on, Amy. Just go and meet with Tanner,

05:22.246 --> 05:25.281
take a look at his horse and
talk up Peter a little bit.

05:25.316 --> 05:27.053
You know, jog his memory about Bedford Oil.

05:27.073 --> 05:29.252
That's important. Oh!

05:29.286 --> 05:32.288
Whatever you do, don't mention Dubai.

05:32.323 --> 05:33.854
Please?

(Truck door bangs shut)

06:22.938 --> 06:26.194
Right on time. Tanner Gunn.

06:26.529 --> 06:28.543
Nice to meet you.

06:28.577 --> 06:30.517
I had one of my guys put
together a profile on you,

06:30.537 --> 06:32.413
and I gotta say, wow.

06:32.969 --> 06:34.882
Oh... a profile?

06:34.902 --> 06:37.551
I-I guess I have to say "wow" too.

06:37.997 --> 06:39.252
Where's your horse?

06:39.287 --> 06:41.931
Tanner: I'll show you.

06:42.594 --> 06:43.728
Tanner: Dingman.

06:43.748 --> 06:45.926
Amy: I can't get much
of a look at him when he's out there.

06:45.960 --> 06:49.196
Tanner: Well,
that's basically the whole problem.

06:49.230 --> 06:50.763
Tanner: So background.

06:50.798 --> 06:52.065
Dingman's a great working cow horse,

06:52.099 --> 06:53.666
but he comes with a challenge.

06:53.701 --> 06:55.802
He doesn't like being stuck in a barn.

06:55.837 --> 06:57.370
Amy: So that's why you
keep him out in the field.

06:57.404 --> 07:00.540
Tanner: Exactly.
Which leads to challenge number two.

07:00.574 --> 07:03.609
(Dingman grunts, hooves pound heavily)

07:03.644 --> 07:06.979
(Birds chirp)

07:07.013 --> 07:09.181
Well, what're you waiting for?

07:09.216 --> 07:11.351
You expect me to catch your horse?

07:11.385 --> 07:13.185
That's why I hired you.

07:13.220 --> 07:16.121
You haven't hired me. Not yet.

07:16.156 --> 07:18.691
And if Dingman's running away from you,
then there's a problem,

07:18.726 --> 07:21.627
and I'm pretty sure that that is the reason
you brought me out here.

07:21.662 --> 07:23.739
Not just to catch your horse.

07:27.834 --> 07:30.702
(Thud of approaching footsteps)

07:30.737 --> 07:32.671
Lou: Grandpa, is everything okay?

07:32.705 --> 07:34.840
Jack: Yeah. Why wouldn't it be?

07:34.875 --> 07:37.676
Come on.
I can tell something's going on with you.

07:37.710 --> 07:40.144
Jack:
Can't a man spend time in his own home

07:40.179 --> 07:42.280
without everybody
thinking there's a crisis?

07:42.314 --> 07:44.015
Lou: Who said anything about a crisis?

07:44.049 --> 07:45.950
Jack: You really wanna know?
You don't wanna know.

07:45.985 --> 07:48.052
Grandpa, I wanna know.

07:48.087 --> 07:51.089
Okay, fine.

07:51.123 --> 07:53.592
So I tell Lisa about Amy's wedding

07:53.626 --> 07:55.559
and she gets all happy and excited,

07:55.594 --> 07:57.295
just like I thought she would.

07:57.329 --> 07:59.630
But right away she starts making lists

07:59.664 --> 08:02.733
and talking about designers
and plans and whatever.

08:02.768 --> 08:04.802
I put my foot in it and
tell her to back off...

08:04.836 --> 08:06.371
Lou: I appreciate you going to bat for me.

08:06.405 --> 08:08.572
I wasn't going to bat for you!

08:08.607 --> 08:11.309
I just said to her Amy and Ty
can figure out for themselves

08:11.343 --> 08:12.543
what kind of wedding they want.

08:12.577 --> 08:15.345
They don't need anybody's help and...

08:15.380 --> 08:17.704
then it turned into an argument
that no one was gonna win,

08:17.724 --> 08:19.617
so I just...

08:19.651 --> 08:21.886
Lou: So what, you just walked away

08:21.920 --> 08:25.222
without even trying to
discuss it rationally?

08:25.256 --> 08:27.525
Well, we just did what we always do.

08:27.559 --> 08:30.227
We take a little break,
let things cool down for a while.

08:30.261 --> 08:32.462
That's crazy, grandpa.

08:32.496 --> 08:36.198
I mean you are never gonna solve
your issues by avoiding them.

08:36.234 --> 08:39.269
Jack: I gotta get going 'cause Georgie
hates it when I keep her waiting.

08:39.304 --> 08:40.602
(Exasperated sigh,
screen door opens and closes)

08:40.638 --> 08:43.573
(Birds chirp)

08:43.607 --> 08:45.608
Amy: The thing I don't get is,
why didn't you just tell me

08:45.643 --> 08:48.611
so I could've come prepared,
brought a horse?

08:48.646 --> 08:51.147
From your reputation, I assumed you
would have a strategic advantage

08:51.181 --> 08:52.882
if you came into this with an open mind.

08:52.917 --> 08:56.285
So you're testing me?

08:56.320 --> 08:58.602
Let's just say I like to
factor synchronicity

08:58.622 --> 09:00.625
and serendipity into my game plan.

09:01.618 --> 09:03.492
Timing and luck.

09:03.526 --> 09:05.382
You don't get to where I am without
having your fair share of it.

09:05.402 --> 09:08.297
I guess you don't.

09:08.332 --> 09:10.899
Hey, uh... my brother-in-law, Peter Morris,

09:10.934 --> 09:12.234
was talking to me about you

09:12.269 --> 09:14.170
and uh...
he had nothing but good things to say

09:14.204 --> 09:16.205
about how you ran your business.

09:16.239 --> 09:18.807
Tanner: Peter Morris... Bedford Oil, right?

09:18.842 --> 09:20.509
Mm-hmm.

09:20.543 --> 09:23.411
Yeah, yeah. I think we met a couple times.

09:23.446 --> 09:25.013
I thought he was in Dubai?

09:25.047 --> 09:28.784
Oh... no. No, Dubai was ages ago.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.787
He's out in Vancouver now doing really,
really well...

09:31.821 --> 09:34.990
but he's thinking of coming to Calgary.

09:35.024 --> 09:36.824
Tanner: Interesting.

09:36.859 --> 09:38.326
(Truck rumbles to a halt)

09:41.897 --> 09:44.699
Ty: Hey, Caleb. (Slams door) What's up?

09:44.733 --> 09:46.567
Caleb: Nothing.

09:46.602 --> 09:49.604
This is for you... and thanks for the beer.

09:49.638 --> 09:51.046
Ty: Yeah, no problem.
Caleb: (Groans as he rises)

09:51.170 --> 09:53.392
Ty: What's this all about?

09:55.377 --> 09:56.921
- Whoa!
- Caleb: Yeah, I did a little thinking

09:56.941 --> 09:58.278
when I was on the road.

09:58.313 --> 10:00.347
I mean keeping your money,
it doesn't seem fair.

10:00.382 --> 10:01.916
I mean, I'm taking care of the business,

10:01.950 --> 10:04.652
you're at the vet clinic,
like a silent partner, so...

10:04.686 --> 10:06.253
Ty: Yeah, man,
but that's what we agreed to.

10:06.287 --> 10:07.954
I'm out, but my money stays in.

10:07.989 --> 10:09.156
Caleb: Yeah, but this way,
if I make a bad deal

10:09.190 --> 10:10.924
or screw up a sale,

10:10.958 --> 10:13.060
it's your money I'm risking.

10:13.094 --> 10:15.095
If I cash this cheque,
you're not gonna have any money to risk.

10:15.130 --> 10:16.363
Caleb: Don't worry about that, okay?

10:16.398 --> 10:18.682
I've already got that part taken care of.

10:19.901 --> 10:22.255
Ty: Jesse?!

10:22.664 --> 10:25.772
Caleb, you took Jesse's offer?

10:25.806 --> 10:28.374
It just makes total sense.
The guy's got deep pockets

10:28.409 --> 10:31.044
and he's gonna take a back
seat to the whole horse thing.

10:31.078 --> 10:34.213
Take a back seat.
Yeah, so he can stab you in the back!

10:34.248 --> 10:36.683
Caleb: Look, I feel bad going
into business with the guy, but...

10:36.717 --> 10:39.586
Ty: Well, you should.
He sucker punched me in the face.

10:39.620 --> 10:41.254
Caleb: Yeah, well,
we were all pretty drunk that night.

10:41.288 --> 10:43.322
Look, the deal with Jesse is,

10:43.357 --> 10:45.258
as long as I buy horses that I can afford

10:45.292 --> 10:47.193
and sell 'em at a good price,
everything'll be fine.

10:47.227 --> 10:49.195
So... just buy low, sell high?

10:49.229 --> 10:51.397
That's your so-called business plan?

10:51.432 --> 10:54.500
It's worked out so far. Mostly.

10:54.535 --> 10:57.603
Yeah, I guess,
but maybe we were just lucky.

10:57.637 --> 10:59.605
What happens now, if your luck runs out?

10:59.639 --> 11:01.640
Do everything in my power to
make sure that doesn't happen.

11:01.675 --> 11:03.943
Yeah, right.

11:03.977 --> 11:05.945
What's going on with you and Cass?

11:05.979 --> 11:08.714
Nothing. We were just talking.

11:08.748 --> 11:12.246
Lay off, man.
I'm not gonna do anything stupid.

11:14.954 --> 11:17.422
Georgie: Jack, I was wondering.
I've had a crazy busy day,

11:17.457 --> 11:20.825
do you think you could get Checkers saddled
while I go do some homework?

11:20.859 --> 11:25.363
Jack: 'Kay,
not so fast. I want you to see something.

11:25.398 --> 11:26.998
You mean the stalls.

11:27.032 --> 11:28.433
Look, I'll muck them out tomorrow, okay?

11:28.468 --> 11:30.068
First thing, I promise.

11:30.102 --> 11:32.503
Jack: Yeah, that's a very good idea,

11:32.537 --> 11:34.371
but it's not just the state of
this barn that's bugging me.

11:34.406 --> 11:35.940
You take a look at Phoenix.

11:35.975 --> 11:38.843
(Restless grunting)

11:38.877 --> 11:41.045
Georgie: Oh my God! What's wrong with him?

11:41.080 --> 11:45.349
(Phoenix grunts) Jack: If you ask me,
I'd say he's bored out of his mind.

11:45.383 --> 11:47.218
Well, I can't turn him out! He'll just
jump the fence and take off again.

11:47.252 --> 11:49.386
He needs you to ride him, every day,

11:49.421 --> 11:51.788
like you promised you would.

11:51.823 --> 11:55.159
Ugh!
Look, I love riding Phoenix, I really do...

11:55.193 --> 11:58.395
But can't he just wait until
tomorrow morning, before school?

11:58.430 --> 12:00.297
Before school,
you'll be mucking out the barn,

12:00.332 --> 12:02.577
like you promised you would.

12:02.962 --> 12:04.434
Jack!

12:04.468 --> 12:07.871
Jack: Tack him up, now.
I'll set the jumps for you.

12:07.905 --> 12:10.540
(Hooves thud, Phoenix pants)

12:13.144 --> 12:15.112
(Phoenix grunts)

12:19.450 --> 12:22.016
Georgie: Did you see that?
He cleared it by a mile.

12:22.036 --> 12:23.520
Jack: Mm-hmm.

12:23.554 --> 12:25.288
Georgie: All right.
I promise, I'll do more tomorrow.

12:25.322 --> 12:28.658
Wait a minute. What...? What're you doing?

12:28.692 --> 12:30.233
Georgie:
I'm taking Phoenix back to the barn.

12:30.253 --> 12:32.162
He hasn't even broken a sweat yet.

12:32.196 --> 12:34.264
Look,
I've had two hours of trick-riding lessons

12:34.298 --> 12:36.231
and I haven't had a minute off all day.

12:36.266 --> 12:37.867
I've still got tons of homework to do.

12:37.901 --> 12:39.808
Couple more times around.

12:39.828 --> 12:40.870
(Sighs)

12:40.904 --> 12:44.406
It'll only take five minutes,
then I'll put him away for you.

12:44.440 --> 12:47.109
Georgie: (Exasperated sigh) Okay.

12:47.144 --> 12:48.377
(Georgie clucks her tongue)

12:48.411 --> 12:51.280
Amy: Wow. That's a lot of money.

12:51.952 --> 12:54.183
Ty: Yeah, it sure is.

12:54.217 --> 12:57.586
Every cent I put into the business,
plus my share of the profits.

12:57.620 --> 13:01.956
- Amy: So...
- Ty: Caleb decided to partner with Jesse.

13:01.991 --> 13:06.027
Amy: (Sighs) Why would he do that?

13:06.062 --> 13:08.330
Ty: Well, he said he didn't wanna
risk losing any of my money.

13:08.364 --> 13:11.166
But I don't trust Jesse, Amy.

13:11.200 --> 13:13.201
If he decides to collect on his loan,

13:13.235 --> 13:16.671
Caleb's gonna be in so deep that he's
gonna have to declare bankruptcy.

13:16.706 --> 13:19.874
Amy: So you're not gonna cash it?

13:19.909 --> 13:22.043
Ty: No. I'm not gonna cash it.

13:22.078 --> 13:25.279
I tried to give it back to him,
but he wouldn't take it.

13:25.314 --> 13:27.715
And I don't wanna be tempted, so...

13:27.749 --> 13:31.285
(Flames crackle)

13:31.320 --> 13:33.754
Ty: (Blows out his breath) Amy: Uh...

13:33.788 --> 13:37.191
You do know that he could
just write you another cheque?

13:37.226 --> 13:39.594
Ty: Yeah... but how many chances do you get

13:39.628 --> 13:41.934
to see that much money go up in flames?

13:41.954 --> 13:43.244
(Laughs)

13:45.166 --> 13:47.334
(Screen door opens and snaps shut)

13:47.368 --> 13:50.534
Amy, where have you been?
I've been waiting for hours!

13:50.554 --> 13:51.671
What happened?

13:51.706 --> 13:54.652
Um, well, Caleb gave Ty a cheque
and then Ty decided to burn it-

13:54.672 --> 13:57.510
No, no, no. With Tanner Gunn.
How did it go?

13:57.545 --> 14:01.194
Oh, um... badly, actually. Really badly.

14:01.214 --> 14:03.049
But I did manage to mention Peter,
like you asked.

14:03.083 --> 14:04.551
What did he say?

14:04.585 --> 14:08.087
Uh... he said, "interesting."

14:08.121 --> 14:09.756
Like... (Flatly) "Interesting,"

14:09.790 --> 14:12.324
or like... (Intrigued) "Interesting"?

14:12.359 --> 14:14.894
I don't know. He also went on
to talk about luck and timing

14:14.929 --> 14:16.828
being the secret to his success.

14:16.863 --> 14:18.764
All I know is that he
is so full of himself,

14:18.798 --> 14:20.832
there is no way I'm going back there.

14:20.867 --> 14:23.135
Lou: What?! No, no, no. Amy, you have to!

14:23.170 --> 14:24.670
You can't quit on me now, Amy.

14:24.704 --> 14:27.073
I already did what you asked, Lou.

14:27.107 --> 14:29.775
Lou: And I am very grateful for that,
but that was just the first step.

14:29.809 --> 14:31.843
I mean, Amy, okay, you planted the seed

14:31.878 --> 14:33.812
and now you have to watch it grow.

14:33.846 --> 14:36.615
And how am I supposed to do that?

14:36.649 --> 14:38.850
Give Tanner the impression
that Peter has had offers...

14:38.885 --> 14:40.886
And make it seem like a
time sensitive situation.

14:40.920 --> 14:43.121
(Chuckles)

14:43.155 --> 14:45.323
Why does everything always
turn out to be about you?

14:45.357 --> 14:46.925
This isn't about me, Amy.

14:46.960 --> 14:49.994
Look, my kids need a father,
I need a husband,

14:50.028 --> 14:53.485
and Peter really needs a job in Calgary!

14:54.633 --> 14:56.568
(Birds chirp, tail swishes)

14:56.602 --> 14:58.836
(Spartan grunts)

14:58.870 --> 15:00.638
All right!

15:04.076 --> 15:06.143
Tanner:
So you're gonna chase him on horseback?

15:06.177 --> 15:09.413
I thought the plan was to teach
Dingman not to run off on me?

15:09.447 --> 15:11.415
Amy: No. The plan is to figure out
why he runs off in the first place.

15:11.449 --> 15:13.484
(Spartan snorts)

15:13.518 --> 15:15.519
You mind getting the gate?

15:15.553 --> 15:17.054
(Chain clanks, gate groans)

15:19.324 --> 15:22.526
(Spartan grunts)

15:22.560 --> 15:23.927
(Dingman grunts, hooves thunder)

15:26.464 --> 15:27.364
(Hooves thunder)

15:29.200 --> 15:30.834
(Hooves thunder)

15:33.771 --> 15:34.904
(Rope whips around, hooves thunder)

15:37.008 --> 15:38.341
(Rope whips through air)

15:40.077 --> 15:42.012
(Dingman whinnies)

15:45.683 --> 15:48.489
Amy: That's it. Easy.

15:50.000 --> 15:56.074

16:00.435 --> 16:02.169
Georgie: The bus! (Broom crashes on floor)

16:02.204 --> 16:03.535
(Georgie sighs,
rooster crows in the distance)

16:03.870 --> 16:04.905
Jack!

16:04.940 --> 16:06.573
Jack: What's wrong?

16:06.607 --> 16:07.741
Georgie:
I got up extra early to do my homework

16:07.775 --> 16:09.176
and muck out the barn, but...

16:09.211 --> 16:11.321
I lost track of time and I missed the bus.

16:11.341 --> 16:12.179
I need a ride.

16:12.214 --> 16:14.081
Please, I promise it won't happen again.

16:14.115 --> 16:16.450
Jack: Yeah, I've been hearing
that a lot from you lately.

16:16.484 --> 16:17.984
(Slams hood shut) You know,
I can't help but think

16:18.018 --> 16:20.354
you might be a little over-extended.

16:20.388 --> 16:21.655
Georgie:
I've had a lot of homework this year.

16:21.689 --> 16:23.423
Please, I need a ride!

16:23.458 --> 16:25.659
Jack: You can't do anything about homework,

16:25.693 --> 16:28.628
but if you can't find the time
for both Phoenix and Checkers,

16:28.663 --> 16:31.597
we're gonna have to look
into some options here.

16:31.631 --> 16:34.200
Georgie: Okay, well,
can we please talk about this in the truck?

16:34.235 --> 16:35.668
Jack: Maybe you can get one of
your friends to help you out?

16:35.702 --> 16:37.937
How about that Olivia?

16:37.972 --> 16:40.606
Georgie: Olivia!? No way!

16:40.640 --> 16:42.641
Jack: Okay, then...
Well, how about Stephen?

16:42.676 --> 16:46.246
Didn't you tell me that
he's a pretty good rider?

16:46.280 --> 16:48.947
Georgie: Yeah, but...
(Slams door) Phoenix is my horse

16:48.982 --> 16:51.216
and I'm the only person who can ride him.

16:51.251 --> 16:52.685
Come on! We need to get going now

16:52.719 --> 16:54.152
or else I'll be late and
they'll give me detention.

16:54.187 --> 16:56.221
It'll make everything worse.

16:56.256 --> 17:00.125
Jack: How about...
you add one more promise to your list

17:00.159 --> 17:02.749
and you tell me you'll think about it?

17:03.563 --> 17:05.205
Georgie: (Sighs heavily)

17:07.767 --> 17:10.269
(Door slams shut, engine starts)

17:12.637 --> 17:15.040
Tanner: Okay, Dingman, let's go.

17:15.074 --> 17:16.340
Come on. Yah! Come on!

17:21.012 --> 17:22.414
(Steers bellow) Yah! Yah!

17:25.550 --> 17:27.318
(Steer bellows)

17:27.352 --> 17:29.854
That's right, I got you now! Ha! Yah!

17:31.891 --> 17:34.793
Hey, boy! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

17:34.827 --> 17:37.795
(Dingman grunts and snorts)

17:37.829 --> 17:39.496
Tanner: Whoa... whoa... (Spurs clink)

17:42.234 --> 17:46.103
So?
First impressions, the unfiltered version.

17:46.138 --> 17:49.006
Amy: Well, Dingman's a good mover.

17:49.041 --> 17:51.608
He has a nice topline
and he's good at his job.

17:51.643 --> 17:53.110
Tanner: Exactly what you
expect when you pay top dollar.

17:53.145 --> 17:55.579
So how about you tell me
something I don't know.

17:55.613 --> 17:59.683
Amy: Okay.
He's got cow sense, but you don't.

17:59.717 --> 18:01.217
And the way you ride,
you're ruining it for him,

18:01.252 --> 18:02.653
you're kicking him with those big spurs

18:02.687 --> 18:05.322
and yanking on his mouth.

18:05.356 --> 18:06.490
Tanner: Look,
I didn't hire you to give me riding lessons

18:06.524 --> 18:09.125
or call me on my dress-code violations.

18:09.160 --> 18:11.861
Amy: (Sighs) Okay,
I don't care why you hired me.

18:11.895 --> 18:14.998
Take a look at this.

18:15.032 --> 18:18.835
See here? Your spurs have broken the skin.

18:18.869 --> 18:22.238
And here... His mouth is all inflamed.

18:22.273 --> 18:23.840
You keep riding him like this

18:23.874 --> 18:24.874
and you're giving him a real good reason

18:24.908 --> 18:26.309
to run away from you in the field.

18:26.344 --> 18:27.710
Tanner:
I've worked with three top trainers.

18:27.744 --> 18:29.311
They were all blown away with
how quickly I picked this up.

18:29.346 --> 18:31.614
Okay. And where are these trainers now?

18:31.648 --> 18:33.683
They quit on me.

18:33.717 --> 18:35.117
Because they didn't have time
to waste chasing Dingman around,

18:35.151 --> 18:37.386
which is why you're here.

18:37.420 --> 18:41.824
Amy: (Exasperated sigh) Well,
I guess you are lucky.

18:41.859 --> 18:44.093
Because I do have time
to work with Dingman.

18:44.127 --> 18:47.229
That is, if you actually want my help.

18:47.263 --> 18:51.500
Tanner: (Sighs) Okay. Okay.

18:51.534 --> 18:52.701
But how 'bout you lay off
the constructive criticism

18:52.735 --> 18:55.037
and focus on Dingman?

18:55.071 --> 18:56.138
Or I'll cancel the meeting I set up

18:56.172 --> 18:58.007
with that brother-in-law of yours

18:58.041 --> 19:00.008
who just happens to be looking for a job.

19:00.042 --> 19:03.044
Come on. (Hooves thud)

19:03.078 --> 19:04.880
Lou:
So when is this meeting supposed to be?

19:04.914 --> 19:09.250
- Amy: Tomorrow.
- Lou: Oh Amy! Thank you so much!

19:09.284 --> 19:10.819
You have no idea what this means to me.

19:10.853 --> 19:12.921
I'm starting to get the idea.

19:12.955 --> 19:13.855
Lou: I don't wanna get my hopes too much,

19:13.890 --> 19:15.356
but like I told you before,

19:15.391 --> 19:17.125
things with me and Peter have been...

19:17.159 --> 19:18.459
kind of rough lately, and this could be it.

19:18.494 --> 19:20.328
This could be our big shot!

19:20.362 --> 19:22.696
Get things back on track, you know? Oh!

19:22.731 --> 19:24.632
And who knows?
Like maybe we can go back to the idea

19:24.666 --> 19:26.267
of getting our own place again!

19:26.301 --> 19:28.336
Lou, he hasn't even had the meeting yet.

19:28.370 --> 19:30.271
Yeah, but, Amy, have you met my husband?

19:30.305 --> 19:32.140
Can you even imagine a situation

19:32.174 --> 19:33.607
where he doesn't make a
great first impression?

19:33.642 --> 19:35.676
Right? Right?

19:35.710 --> 19:38.779
Mm-muah!

19:38.813 --> 19:40.414
(Low hum of chatter, birds chirp)

19:40.448 --> 19:44.151
(Door bells jingle)

19:44.185 --> 19:46.119
- Georgie: Hey!
- Stephen: Hey. What's up?

19:46.154 --> 19:49.356
Nothing much. Are you still riding?

19:49.390 --> 19:52.325
Only when I visit my dad. I really miss it.

19:52.360 --> 19:54.594
Do you remember my horse Phoenix?

19:54.628 --> 19:55.462
Of course. He's the jumper, right?

19:55.496 --> 19:57.197
Yeah, yeah.

19:57.231 --> 19:59.032
You see, I've been focusing a lot

19:59.067 --> 20:00.667
on my trick riding lately, and...

20:00.701 --> 20:02.569
I don't have much time to ride him.

20:02.603 --> 20:04.704
I need someone to exercise
him on a regular basis.

20:04.738 --> 20:06.539
And you're asking me?!

20:06.574 --> 20:10.944
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

20:10.978 --> 20:13.880
So... I talked to Stephen and he says he
can come over and ride Phoenix for me.

20:13.914 --> 20:16.082
He's gonna start tomorrow after school.

20:16.116 --> 20:18.250
Jack: Well, I'm glad you worked that out.

20:18.285 --> 20:20.787
Amy: So, Lou, maybe we should add
Stephen's name to the wedding guest list?

20:20.821 --> 20:22.788
Lou: Yes. Of course.
Amy: (Chuckles)

20:22.822 --> 20:25.091
Um, and speaking of weddings,

20:25.125 --> 20:27.259
grandpa,
have you patched things up with Lisa yet?

20:27.294 --> 20:30.429
Jack: There's nothing to patch up.

20:30.464 --> 20:32.298
Lou: You know you're just
avoiding the inevitable.

20:32.332 --> 20:34.133
Jack: Actually,
I'm just trying to eat my dinner.

20:34.167 --> 20:36.569
Lou: Look, I hate to break it to you,

20:36.603 --> 20:38.937
but everyone knows that
communication is the key

20:38.972 --> 20:42.474
to a healthy relationship.

20:42.508 --> 20:45.376
Jack: We might not be talking,
but we're communicating...

20:45.411 --> 20:47.445
loud and clear.

20:47.480 --> 20:50.415
We're both saying,
I don't wanna talk about it.

20:50.449 --> 20:52.217
Which is exactly what I'm
trying to say to you right now.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.685
But the difference is, Lisa and I,

20:53.720 --> 20:55.927
we're listening to each other.

20:59.742 --> 21:02.160
Lou: So how's your work going?

21:02.844 --> 21:05.830
Uh, same. Same. You know.

21:05.864 --> 21:08.233
I have to go into Calgary tomorrow
for a meeting, by the way.

21:08.267 --> 21:12.903
Lou: Oh? You have a meeting?

21:12.938 --> 21:16.406
Uh... yeah. Yeah. Nothing special.

21:16.441 --> 21:18.342
Lou: But it must be important. I mean...

21:18.376 --> 21:21.445
going all the way into the city.

21:21.479 --> 21:25.850
No. It's just an everyday normal meeting,
Lou.

21:25.884 --> 21:29.419
Lou: Who's it with? Anyone I know?

21:29.454 --> 21:31.721
No. I know where you're going with this

21:31.756 --> 21:35.253
and I don't wanna talk about it.

21:36.668 --> 21:39.129
(Sighs) Is there anything
you do wanna talk about?

21:39.164 --> 21:42.666
No. It's too late for talking.

21:42.700 --> 21:44.368
(Kiss)

21:44.402 --> 21:47.403
Good night.

21:47.437 --> 21:49.372
(Light clicks off)

21:54.006 --> 21:55.706
Good night.

21:59.441 --> 22:01.799
I am going to Calcary, Lou.
You know I go there all the time.

22:02.179 --> 22:03.279
Lou: I know. I just want you to look nice.

22:03.314 --> 22:05.764
Peter: Okay, thank you. Bye, kitty cat.

22:05.784 --> 22:07.384
Muah. Bye!

22:07.418 --> 22:09.352
- Katie: Bye!
- Lou: Bye, honey. Have fun!

22:09.387 --> 22:13.189
Peter: Thanks.
(Screen door opens and closes)

22:13.224 --> 22:15.258
Amy: Lou,
why didn't you just tell him that you know?

22:15.292 --> 22:17.026
Because last night,
no matter how many hints I dropped,

22:17.060 --> 22:19.128
he didn't take the bait.

22:19.148 --> 22:19.743
Amy: So...?

22:19.763 --> 22:22.464
So he obviously doesn't
wanna talk about it.

22:22.499 --> 22:24.299
- Amy: Well, why not?
- Lou: I don't know.

22:24.334 --> 22:26.335
Maybe...
maybe he just doesn't wanna disappoint me,

22:26.369 --> 22:28.571
you know, in case he doesn't get the job.

22:28.605 --> 22:30.671
Amy: Yeah... that makes sense, I guess.

22:30.691 --> 22:32.689
(Sighs heavily)

22:36.995 --> 22:40.782
Georgie: Okay. So first,
I'll just take these jumps down for you.

22:40.816 --> 22:42.518
Stephen: What're you talking about?
He's a jumper, isn't he?

22:42.552 --> 22:44.086
Georgie: Yes, but he gets pretty wound up.

22:44.120 --> 22:46.922
I mean, not with me, but you just...

22:46.956 --> 22:48.223
you gotta go easy on him, okay?

22:48.258 --> 22:50.324
I don't want you to risk hurting him...

22:50.359 --> 22:53.161
Or, I guess, hurting yourself.

22:53.195 --> 22:54.863
I think it would be better if you just...

22:54.897 --> 22:58.132
rode around the edge of the ring.

22:58.167 --> 23:00.936
But we could set up some
cavalettis if you want?

23:00.970 --> 23:02.170
No, you don't have to do that.

23:02.204 --> 23:03.672
Georgie: Okay, here. Hop on.

23:06.108 --> 23:08.876
Okay. So... he's got a pretty soft mouth,

23:08.910 --> 23:10.478
and be careful with your reins.

23:10.512 --> 23:12.613
Stephen: Uh-huh.

23:12.647 --> 23:14.782
Georgie: But don't give him
his head or he will take off.

23:14.816 --> 23:16.284
You gotta show him who's boss.

23:16.318 --> 23:18.652
Stephen: Okay, okay, I get it.

23:18.687 --> 23:20.688
Georgie: Good boy.

23:20.722 --> 23:23.557
(Hooves thud)

23:29.163 --> 23:30.998
(Hooves thud)

23:31.032 --> 23:33.067
Okay, don't bounce so much!

23:33.101 --> 23:34.468
But loosen up your reins!

23:34.502 --> 23:36.637
(Hooves thud)

23:36.671 --> 23:38.171
Inside leg!

23:38.206 --> 23:39.639
(Hooves thud)

23:41.974 --> 23:44.177
Stephen!

23:44.212 --> 23:45.479
Stephen, what're you doing?
I said no jumping!

23:45.513 --> 23:46.746
(Hooves thud)

23:46.780 --> 23:50.417
Stop!

23:50.451 --> 23:52.222
Stephen: Atta boy!

23:54.288 --> 23:56.322
- Georgie: What was that?!
- Stephen: What's your problem?

23:56.356 --> 23:58.992
Well,
I told you not to take him over any jumps!

23:59.026 --> 24:01.594
Stephen: They aren't even high,
and I know what I'm doing.

24:01.629 --> 24:03.195
Georgie: Yeah, but...
maybe on a regular horse,

24:03.230 --> 24:06.065
but Phoenix is special, okay?

24:06.100 --> 24:07.734
I don't want him developing any bad habits.

24:07.768 --> 24:09.268
Stephen: Like what?

24:09.302 --> 24:10.703
Georgie:
It doesn't matter "like what," okay?!

24:10.738 --> 24:12.771
I just want you to ride the
horse like I told you to!

24:12.805 --> 24:14.039
You mean, just around and
around while you yell at me?

24:14.073 --> 24:17.543
Yes! Exactly.

24:17.577 --> 24:20.646
(Phoenix snorts softly,
hooves thud, tack jingles)

24:23.133 --> 24:24.550
(Diners chatter)

24:27.754 --> 24:31.489
Amy: Ty, I ordered you some chili.
What's wrong?

24:31.524 --> 24:34.425
Caleb and Cass...
they're making out right out there.

24:34.460 --> 24:38.163
Making out?

24:38.197 --> 24:39.731
Caleb:
That was a little less than charismatic.

24:39.766 --> 24:41.967
Ty: Well... maybe they weren't making out,

24:42.001 --> 24:44.036
but there was definitely a kiss involved.

24:44.070 --> 24:45.570
Come on, Ty, you of all people should know

24:45.604 --> 24:47.205
it's not fair to make
assumptions about something

24:47.239 --> 24:50.324
that could be nothing more- get down!

24:50.344 --> 24:51.706
Ty: What? Why are we hiding?

24:51.726 --> 24:54.045
Amy: Okay,
that definitely counts as making out.

24:55.015 --> 24:57.448
Oh my God.

24:57.483 --> 25:00.361
What is he doing kissing his
business partner's girlfriend?

25:02.905 --> 25:06.390
Peter: This is great, but uh...
what's the occasion?

25:06.424 --> 25:08.726
Lou: I don't know.
I just thought it would be nice

25:08.760 --> 25:11.495
for us to spend some together,
just me and you.

25:11.529 --> 25:13.498
- Peter: Yeah.
- Lou: Here you go.

25:13.518 --> 25:16.100
Peter: Thank you. (Wine pours)

25:16.134 --> 25:18.968
(Birds chirp)

25:19.450 --> 25:21.385
Lou: So, how was Calgary?

25:21.405 --> 25:24.140
Peter: Mm...

25:24.174 --> 25:26.943
It was all right.
You know, same old, same old.

25:26.978 --> 25:30.246
A few meetings and...

25:30.280 --> 25:34.250
Nothing... out of the ordinary?

25:34.284 --> 25:36.552
- Peter: Nope.
- Lou: No?

25:36.587 --> 25:40.723
Nope. Like I said, just...
Yeah, a few meetings and...

25:40.757 --> 25:43.159
- Lou: Mm.
- Peter: And uh...

25:43.193 --> 25:47.263
Lou: Did one of them happen
to be with Tanner Gunn?

25:47.297 --> 25:49.898
Yes. How do you know that?

25:49.933 --> 25:52.935
Amy. She told me.

25:52.969 --> 25:54.770
- Peter: Amy told you?
- Lou: Yeah, yeah. She's...

25:54.804 --> 25:57.106
Lou:
She's working at the big Gunn ranch.

25:57.140 --> 26:01.476
That's Tanner's ranch and...
She heard about it.

26:01.511 --> 26:03.345
So Amy knew about my meeting with Tanner?

26:03.379 --> 26:04.513
- Lou: Mm-hmm.
- Peter: That's bizarre.

26:04.547 --> 26:07.215
Yeah. So how was it?

26:07.250 --> 26:10.051
Uh... it was... fine.

26:10.085 --> 26:12.687
Um, one of Tanner's people just
called me up out of the blue,

26:12.721 --> 26:16.291
and so I went in and met with Tanner and...

26:16.325 --> 26:18.693
we talked a little bit about...

26:18.727 --> 26:22.364
you know, schedules,
projects, industry stuff.

26:23.178 --> 26:24.365
And...?

26:24.978 --> 26:27.301
Peter: And...

26:27.335 --> 26:30.304
we talked about possibly
working together in the future.

26:30.338 --> 26:31.906
No formal offer or anything though.

26:31.940 --> 26:35.677
Just more of a let's-keep-in
touch kind of thing.

26:35.971 --> 26:38.490
- Lou: Hmm.
- Peter: Yeah.

26:39.581 --> 26:41.415
Lou: And that was that!
Let's keep in touch!

26:41.449 --> 26:44.518
I'm so sorry, Lou.

26:44.553 --> 26:46.019
Lou: Maybe I got carried away, you know?

26:46.054 --> 26:47.921
But I just...
I thought this could really be it.

26:47.955 --> 26:50.057
This could be the answer to everything.

26:50.091 --> 26:52.893
Amy: Yeah, but there'll be other jobs,
other opportunities.

26:52.927 --> 26:54.761
Yeah,
but Peter isn't looking for other jobs.

26:54.796 --> 26:58.065
Lou! You're driving me crazy!

26:58.099 --> 27:00.867
You keep lecturing grandpa
about communication!

27:00.902 --> 27:02.803
Why don't you take your own advice?

27:02.837 --> 27:06.173
Tell Peter why things have to change!

27:06.207 --> 27:09.910
Lou: Because, Amy, I think I already
know what he's gonna say, okay?

27:09.944 --> 27:12.571
And I'm pretty sure it's
not what I wanna hear.

27:19.052 --> 27:21.321
(Low hum of chatter)

27:21.355 --> 27:23.856
Georgie: Stephen! Hey.

27:23.890 --> 27:26.226
So do you wanna come over and ride Phoenix
after school today?

27:26.260 --> 27:29.829
Well, I've got a lot of homework and...

27:29.863 --> 27:32.431
Yeah, sorry, I don't think I'll be
able to ride him for you any more.

27:32.465 --> 27:34.800
What? I thought you said you wanted to.

27:34.835 --> 27:38.804
I did, and I really like Phoenix, but...

27:38.839 --> 27:40.840
You know, riding a horse,
it's supposed to be fun

27:40.874 --> 27:43.008
and you made it totally not fun.

27:43.043 --> 27:44.309
(Diners chatter)

27:45.089 --> 27:46.145
Sorry.

27:46.592 --> 27:49.147
(Door opens)

27:49.181 --> 27:50.949
Tanner: Come on. Go, go, go!
Go, go! Come on!

27:50.983 --> 27:55.587
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

27:55.622 --> 27:57.589
Okay, I don't see what this has to do
with collecting a horse from a field.

27:57.624 --> 28:00.292
This isn't gonna work if you keep talking.

28:00.326 --> 28:02.494
Come on! Go, go, go! Go, go! Come on!

28:02.528 --> 28:04.595
Come on! Well, so what now?

28:04.630 --> 28:07.331
- Amy: Just keep driving him.
- Tanner: Ha!

28:07.366 --> 28:10.401
That's it, you're almost there.

28:10.435 --> 28:11.502
Y'know, to tell you the truth, I didn't
think you were gonna show up today.

28:11.536 --> 28:13.772
- Ha! Ha!
- Amy: Why not?

28:13.806 --> 28:15.940
Tanner: 'Cause you got what you wanted. Ha!

28:15.975 --> 28:18.176
The meeting with your brother-in-law.

28:18.210 --> 28:20.645
That's not why I'm here.

28:20.679 --> 28:22.913
Tanner: Ha! Come on! Ha!

28:22.947 --> 28:25.549
Amy: Okay. Now, now turn away...
take the pressure off him.

28:25.584 --> 28:27.251
Let Dingman decide what to do.

28:27.286 --> 28:29.052
(Dingman pants)

28:33.492 --> 28:35.493
(happy sigh)

28:35.527 --> 28:39.462
(Birds chirp, Dingman snorts softly)

28:39.497 --> 28:42.199
Whoa! He's never done that before!

28:42.233 --> 28:43.901
Amy: Now, give him a pat.

28:43.935 --> 28:45.836
Let him know that he made the
right choice trusting you.

28:45.870 --> 28:49.645
Good boy, Dingman. Good boy.

28:50.374 --> 28:53.109
That's a good boy, yes.

28:53.690 --> 28:55.144
I totally get it.

28:55.179 --> 28:57.580
Lean in too hard, you break the connection.

28:57.615 --> 29:00.149
Ease off,
the nexus of power shifts back to you.

29:00.184 --> 29:03.119
You stumbled on the basics
of motivational dynamics.

29:03.153 --> 29:06.323
Amy: Yeah,
that's exactly what I stumbled on.

29:06.357 --> 29:08.124
By the way, I didn't take this job

29:08.158 --> 29:09.826
so I could push Peter on you.

29:09.860 --> 29:11.994
I just thought it would
be good if you two met.

29:12.029 --> 29:14.330
Tanner: Mm. So did I.

29:14.364 --> 29:16.565
My gut told me the time was right.

29:16.599 --> 29:19.268
The chemistry was good,
all the elements were in sync.

29:19.303 --> 29:22.604
So I made him the best offer
he's gonna get in this town.

29:22.639 --> 29:24.406
- Amy: What happened?
- Tanner: Well, nothing so far.

29:24.441 --> 29:27.296
Just waiting to hear back from him.

29:32.086 --> 29:35.338
I think I should tell Lou.
She will find out it anyway.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.631
Ty: Yeah,
but if Peter's planning a big surprise,

29:38.651 --> 29:40.971
you'll have ruined it for them.

29:41.973 --> 29:44.441
Amy...

29:44.475 --> 29:46.456
Let's say I was planning to propose to you.

29:46.476 --> 29:48.277
(Snorts) I think you already did that.

29:48.311 --> 29:50.498
Okay, but let's just say.

29:50.688 --> 29:53.157
And I don't know what size ring to buy you,
so I ask Lou-

29:53.177 --> 29:55.292
Whoa, whoa, wrong person,
you know her with secrets.

29:55.312 --> 29:56.103
Continue.

29:56.123 --> 29:59.722
Ty:
How would you feel if she already told you?

29:59.757 --> 30:01.557
The big day comes...

30:01.591 --> 30:03.821
I pop some champagne,
I pull out the ring...

30:03.841 --> 30:05.962
It's supposed to be a special
moment between me and you,

30:05.996 --> 30:10.033
and instead, it's this... "Yeah, cool.
I knew that."

30:10.067 --> 30:12.468
Amy: (Snorts with laughter)
Ty: Amy, I'm serious. Okay?

30:12.502 --> 30:14.503
Lou's got you way too wrapped up in this.

30:14.538 --> 30:18.640
Peter is the one who should tell her.
Not you.

30:18.675 --> 30:20.576
(Feed rustles)

30:20.610 --> 30:22.244
Jack: What happened?

30:22.279 --> 30:25.114
I thought you had Stephen
riding Phoenix for you?

30:25.148 --> 30:27.649
Well, yeah, but... (Gate clicks open)

30:27.684 --> 30:29.151
he decided he didn't want to any more.

30:29.186 --> 30:30.752
Well... why?

30:30.787 --> 30:32.388
(Gate clanks shut)

30:32.422 --> 30:34.489
Georgie: Because of me.

30:34.523 --> 30:36.625
Look, I... (Sighs heavily)

30:36.659 --> 30:39.394
When I saw him riding Phoenix, I got all...

30:39.428 --> 30:40.829
I-I don't know.

30:41.511 --> 30:43.331
Jealous?

30:43.365 --> 30:47.703
Maybe. I didn't want
Phoenix to be a good horse.

30:47.737 --> 30:50.553
I wanted him to be himself, you know?
Difficult and strong-headed.

30:50.573 --> 30:53.541
But no. Nothing happened.

30:53.973 --> 30:56.377
They were perfect together!

30:56.412 --> 31:01.015
So I... I yelled at him and...
I didn't let him jump,

31:01.049 --> 31:03.384
so I... I pretty much ruined everything.

31:04.150 --> 31:06.754
Okay. Well, you say...

31:06.788 --> 31:10.925
that Stephen and Phoenix are a good fit,
right?

31:10.959 --> 31:14.028
'Kay.
So why don't you give him another try?

31:14.062 --> 31:15.262
I don't know if I can.

31:15.296 --> 31:18.398
Of course you can!

31:18.433 --> 31:20.835
Pick up the phone...

31:20.869 --> 31:23.437
"Hi Stephen. It's Georgie.

31:23.471 --> 31:26.706
I wanna tell you how sorry I am

31:26.741 --> 31:29.176
and how much I appreciated all your help,

31:29.210 --> 31:33.046
and I promise I won't
wreck things anymore."

31:33.693 --> 31:38.252
See? Done. Hmm..

31:38.286 --> 31:40.120
Georgie: 'Kay, well...
W-where are you going?

31:40.154 --> 31:43.103
Jack: (Amused) Oh,
I got a call to make too.

31:46.193 --> 31:50.229
Georgie: Stephen. Yeah.
Hi, it... it-it's Georgie.

31:50.264 --> 31:52.601
(Birds chirp, grasses rustle in the breeze)

31:59.005 --> 32:02.575
Lou: You know, when Amy told me
about that meeting with Tanner Gunn,

32:02.609 --> 32:04.009
it made me realize how great it would be

32:04.044 --> 32:08.106
if you actually did get a job in Calgary.

32:08.126 --> 32:10.047
Peter: You know what's funny about that?
I've been meaning to ask you...

32:10.067 --> 32:13.886
Um... if you knew about that meeting,
why didn't you just tell me?

32:14.447 --> 32:16.822
Lou: Uh, because... I didn't wanna jinx it.

32:16.856 --> 32:21.193
I mean,
if you actually did get a serious offer.

32:21.227 --> 32:24.329
Peter: Right.
Yeah, it's too bad about that.

32:24.363 --> 32:28.734
But you know, life doesn't always
go the way you want it to, right?

32:29.096 --> 32:32.660
Lou... come here. Look at me.

32:33.506 --> 32:36.641
I know you're disappointed, okay?
But you shouldn't be.

32:36.676 --> 32:38.176
I mean, we got a good thing going here.

32:38.211 --> 32:40.812
I'm-I'm making good money,
we get to spend time together,

32:40.846 --> 32:43.014
we get to spend time
with Georgie and Katie...

32:43.048 --> 32:45.083
Lou: But, honey,
I get to spend all of my time with them,

32:45.117 --> 32:47.852
twenty-four hours a day,
and you're usually not here.

32:47.886 --> 32:50.521
For you, it's just quality time.

32:50.555 --> 32:55.259
Well... every job comes with a price,
Lou. You know that.

32:55.293 --> 32:57.895
And me working in Vancouver,
is that really such a high price to pay?

32:57.930 --> 33:00.464
Lou: Maybe not for you,
but y-you have got two lives,

33:00.498 --> 33:02.700
and you get to decompress in between them.
(Peter's phone buzzes)

33:02.734 --> 33:05.936
I have-I have one life,
Peter, and it's here.

33:05.970 --> 33:08.071
Peter: I have to take this.
(Phone buzzes) Sorry.

33:08.106 --> 33:10.741
Lou: (Sighs heavily) Oh... okay.

33:10.775 --> 33:14.478
Okay. (Phone beeps) Hey. Yeah, yeah.

33:14.512 --> 33:17.381
No, no, no. It's fine. It's good timing.

33:17.415 --> 33:20.949
Yes, I'm all set up. Let me just
grab my laptop we'll go through it...

33:23.420 --> 33:27.090
Amy: Okay,
you definitely don't need these spurs...

33:27.125 --> 33:29.425
And I don't wanna see
you kicking him either.

33:29.460 --> 33:31.694
Keep your reins loose and low.

33:31.729 --> 33:33.964
Just let the horse do his job.

33:33.998 --> 33:37.133
Tanner: Okay, like you mean...
I'm just a passenger?

33:37.167 --> 33:40.236
Amy: Well,
more like a silent partner, right?

33:40.271 --> 33:43.239
And if you trust the horse,
maybe he'll trust you too.

33:43.274 --> 33:45.040
- Tanner: Okay.
- Amy: All right.

33:45.060 --> 33:47.008
Tanner: 'Kay, come on.

33:50.818 --> 33:53.002
(Dingman grunts and pants)

33:57.554 --> 33:59.321
(Steer bellows)

34:02.058 --> 34:04.426
Tanner: Come on, Dingman.
Come on! Come on, boy!

34:04.461 --> 34:06.695
(Steer bellows)

34:06.729 --> 34:09.163
Amy: Be patient, all right?
Don't push him too hard.

34:09.197 --> 34:12.233
Tanner: 'Kay, I got this. Atta boy!

34:12.266 --> 34:13.735
Amy: Let him follow the feel.

34:13.768 --> 34:15.670
That's it!

34:15.705 --> 34:17.170
Tanner: Ha! Yah!

34:17.206 --> 34:19.172
(Steer bellows)

34:19.208 --> 34:20.241
(Hooves thud)

34:20.275 --> 34:22.643
Careful.

34:22.678 --> 34:24.512
Tanner: Ha! Yah!

34:24.545 --> 34:26.414
Keep your elbows down!

34:26.447 --> 34:29.183
Tanner: Okay. Ha!

34:29.217 --> 34:31.152
There you go!

34:31.186 --> 34:33.454
(Steer bellows) Ha! Yah!

34:37.121 --> 34:38.493
Whoa...

34:38.527 --> 34:40.893
Amy: Okay,
that was definitely an improvement.

34:40.929 --> 34:42.929
Tanner: Well, that's good to know.

34:42.964 --> 34:46.100
I was starting to wonder if I'm
getting my money's worth on this guy.

34:46.134 --> 34:48.201
(Laughing) I'm not talking about Dingman.
He is a great horse

34:48.235 --> 34:50.170
and you definitely got your money's worth.

34:50.204 --> 34:51.605
It's you that still needs a lot of work!

34:51.639 --> 34:53.806
(Chuckles) Okay.

34:58.166 --> 35:00.947
If you're looking for Cass,
she's out doing the rounds with Scott.

35:00.981 --> 35:03.116
Caleb: I'm not looking for Cass,
I'm looking for you.

35:03.151 --> 35:05.519
I was just at the bank. You didn't uh...

35:05.553 --> 35:08.188
You didn't cash that cheque.

35:08.222 --> 35:12.225
Ty: No, I didn't. I burned it.

35:12.260 --> 35:14.761
(Laughing) What? You burned it?

35:14.795 --> 35:16.963
Who burns a cheque?

35:16.997 --> 35:20.166
I do. And it was a symbolic gesture.

35:20.200 --> 35:21.901
But after seeing you making
out with Cass outside Maggie's,

35:21.935 --> 35:24.170
I seriously regret it.

35:24.204 --> 35:25.838
Caleb: What are you talking about?

35:25.873 --> 35:28.641
Dude, I saw you slobbering all over her.

35:28.676 --> 35:30.242
Okay, you know what? For the record,

35:30.277 --> 35:32.211
it was just a little
goodbye peck on the cheek.

35:32.245 --> 35:34.680
There was no slobbering involved.

35:34.714 --> 35:37.716
Right. Does Jesse know about this?

35:37.750 --> 35:40.118
No. (Sighs)

35:40.153 --> 35:41.720
I'll tell him when the time is right.

35:41.754 --> 35:45.023
(Snorts) Really.

35:45.058 --> 35:46.958
And when's the right time to
tell your business partner

35:46.993 --> 35:48.560
that you're hooking up with his girlfriend?

35:48.594 --> 35:50.461
I don't know. (Chuckles)

35:50.496 --> 35:52.297
What're you laughing at, man?

35:52.331 --> 35:55.266
Okay,
Cass has exams. I'll tell him after that,

35:55.301 --> 35:59.037
but we'll have to proceed with some caution
given the financial implications, but...

35:59.072 --> 36:01.807
Ty: Yeah,
and because you're totally screwed

36:01.841 --> 36:03.575
if Jesse calls in his loan and you don't
have enough money to bail yourself out.

36:03.609 --> 36:06.311
Caleb: Okay, I-I get it.

36:06.345 --> 36:09.146
I appreciate your concern, but don't worry.

36:09.181 --> 36:12.416
I'm not gonna touch the money.

36:12.450 --> 36:14.484
Ty: All right.

36:14.519 --> 36:16.286
Look, man, I've watched it
go up in flames once already,

36:16.321 --> 36:20.790
and if you keep doing what you're doing,
it's gonna happen for real.

36:20.825 --> 36:22.451
Caleb: (Sighs heavily)

36:23.861 --> 36:25.529
(Sighs heavily)

36:25.563 --> 36:27.864
(Tack jingles, hooves thunder)

36:30.434 --> 36:31.868
(Gate creaks shut)

36:33.938 --> 36:36.080
(Chain clanks)

36:41.056 --> 36:43.079
You know, Amy, in the end,

36:43.114 --> 36:44.913
I think we make a pretty good team.

36:44.948 --> 36:46.915
I'm glad it worked out for you.

36:46.950 --> 36:50.085
Oh,
I think it worked out for the both of us.

36:50.120 --> 36:52.821
Now, I know we may have had our
differences at the beginning,

36:52.856 --> 36:54.457
but when you get to the
point I'm at in life,

36:54.491 --> 36:56.726
you realize it's not about
surrounding yourself with yes men.

36:56.760 --> 36:59.128
You also need people who
are gonna say no to you.

36:59.162 --> 37:02.164
So... I'm gonna need a new trainer,

37:02.198 --> 37:04.800
and I think you are the
perfect person for the job.

37:04.834 --> 37:06.701
Well, thank you.

37:06.736 --> 37:08.203
But I've got a lot going on right now

37:08.238 --> 37:10.338
and I need to focus on
what's important to me.

37:10.373 --> 37:12.244
But I'm more than happy
to find you a trainer

37:12.264 --> 37:13.776
that'll say no to you.

37:13.810 --> 37:17.712
Wow. First, your brother-in-law
turns me down, and now you...

37:17.747 --> 37:20.749
Amy: Wha...? Peter turned you down?

37:20.783 --> 37:22.450
- When did that happen?
- Tanner: This morning.

37:22.485 --> 37:24.452
Just like you, no discussion,
no negotiation,

37:24.487 --> 37:26.788
just thanks but no thanks.

37:31.327 --> 37:33.327
Lou: That's impossible. I don't believe it!

37:33.361 --> 37:35.329
Amy: That's what he told me, Lou.

37:35.363 --> 37:38.866
Lou: Maybe it was just a low-ball offer,
like a courtesy type of thing?

37:38.901 --> 37:41.602
Amy: No. See, Tanner told me
that he made Peter a great offer

37:41.636 --> 37:43.905
and that Peter just said no.

37:43.939 --> 37:45.372
Lou: That doesn't make any sense.

37:45.407 --> 37:47.809
Why would Peter refuse
a job with Tanner Gunn?

37:47.843 --> 37:49.010
Well, I wouldn't work for him.

37:49.044 --> 37:50.778
He's so full of himself
it would make me puke.

37:50.812 --> 37:52.346
Maybe he's lying about the offer?

37:52.380 --> 37:53.980
I don't see why he would do that.

37:54.015 --> 37:57.017
Just to show you how much power and money
he has to throw around?

37:57.051 --> 37:58.919
No. See, we're past that.

37:58.953 --> 38:03.156
Now, he's all about impressing me
with his intuitive understanding of horses.

38:03.191 --> 38:04.625
If what you're saying is true,

38:04.659 --> 38:09.234
then Peter didn't just avoid telling me
about the offer and the meeting.

38:09.254 --> 38:11.178
He totally lied to me.

38:20.932 --> 38:24.626
Ty: Hey, Caleb, what's up now?

38:25.169 --> 38:27.537
Well, I had a chance to talk to Cass.

38:27.572 --> 38:29.006
We decided to cool things off a bit

38:29.040 --> 38:31.875
until she's had a chance to tell Jesse.

38:31.910 --> 38:34.463
Good. Glad to hear that, man.

38:36.560 --> 38:38.415
This is for you.

38:41.152 --> 38:42.719
Ty: What is it?

38:42.753 --> 38:43.953
Caleb: (Slams door shut) It's like I said,

38:43.988 --> 38:44.988
I didn't want you to have to worry.

38:45.022 --> 38:46.389
(Starts engine)

38:46.424 --> 38:48.592
(Zipper unzips)

38:51.795 --> 38:53.462
(Truck rumbles away)

38:55.722 --> 38:58.300
Lou: That's a pretty dress.
What do you think about that one?

38:58.335 --> 39:00.576
Katie: Uh... I wanna pink one.

39:00.596 --> 39:03.673
Lou: I know, but I don't think it's
gonna be a very pink wedding, honey.

39:03.707 --> 39:06.442
(Gasps) How about that one?

39:06.476 --> 39:08.310
Katie: I still want a pink one.

39:08.345 --> 39:10.912
Lou: (Chuckles) Where are you going?

39:11.308 --> 39:13.516
Jack: (Bag thumps on floor) Oh,
I called Lisa last night.

39:13.550 --> 39:15.884
Lou: Oh? Why don't you go play, okay?

39:15.918 --> 39:18.820
- And?
- Jack: And she said that...

39:18.855 --> 39:21.357
she knows that she can be kind of pushy

39:21.391 --> 39:23.358
when she just means to be helpful,

39:23.392 --> 39:25.577
and that she won't get
involved with the wedding

39:25.597 --> 39:28.329
unless she asks Amy.

39:28.364 --> 39:31.332
I said I was sorry about
sticking my foot in it,

39:31.367 --> 39:34.939
and I'd talk to Amy,
see how she feels about Lisa helping out.

39:34.959 --> 39:38.774
Lou: And now you're going back
there like nothing happened?

39:38.808 --> 39:41.976
Jack: Yeah. Well, that's the plan, I guess.

39:42.010 --> 39:44.710
Lou: Do you have to go?

39:45.366 --> 39:47.982
(Sighs) I didn't mean that, I just...

39:48.483 --> 39:49.902
Everything okay?

39:49.922 --> 39:51.619
Lou: Yes. (Sighs)

39:52.224 --> 39:53.454
No. I...

39:53.489 --> 39:55.823
I just-I just feel so stupid,

39:55.857 --> 39:58.159
you know, criticizing you and Lisa for...
(Shaky breath)

39:58.193 --> 39:59.727
the way you communicate or don't...

39:59.761 --> 40:01.628
and... (Shaky breath)

40:01.663 --> 40:04.198
(Bag and hat thump on floor)

40:04.232 --> 40:06.100
Jack: What's wrong, Lou?

40:06.134 --> 40:08.535
Lou: (Crying) Peter and I...

40:08.570 --> 40:10.437
Our entire marriage is based on nothing

40:10.471 --> 40:13.139
but dishonesty and deceit! (Crying)

40:16.377 --> 40:18.978
(Crying)

40:24.919 --> 40:27.821
Georgie: Stephen,
I'm really glad you decided to come back.

40:27.855 --> 40:29.555
Stephen: It's no problem.

40:29.590 --> 40:31.290
Georgie: And I promise I'm
not gonna tell you what to do

40:31.325 --> 40:33.226
or how to jump or anything, okay?

40:33.260 --> 40:36.062
I'm just gonna... Go and do my homework

40:36.097 --> 40:39.432
and let you have some fun, 'kay?
Do whatever.

40:39.466 --> 40:40.233
Stephen:
Maybe you could stick around for a bit,

40:40.267 --> 40:41.968
in case I knock off a few rails?

40:42.002 --> 40:43.737
Georgie: Yeah, yeah, sure.

40:43.771 --> 40:47.306
Okay, go ahead. (Stephen clucks his tongue)

40:47.341 --> 40:50.276
(Hooves thud, Phoenix grunts)

40:53.413 --> 40:55.147
(Hooves thud)

41:00.254 --> 41:01.687
Ty: So he offered you a job?

41:01.722 --> 41:05.390
Amy: Yeah, and I was pretty hard on him.

41:05.424 --> 41:07.793
But as it turns out,
he appreciated my honesty.

41:07.827 --> 41:10.495
(Laughing)

41:10.529 --> 41:14.432
You know,
everything that happened with you and me

41:14.467 --> 41:16.268
is because I wasn't
totally straight with you.

41:16.302 --> 41:18.970
So from now on, no matter what,

41:19.004 --> 41:22.407
let's always tell each other the truth.

41:22.441 --> 41:24.709
- Ty: I swear to tell the truth...
- Amy: Ty!

41:24.744 --> 41:27.039
- The whole truth and nothing but the truth
- Amy: I'm being serious! Come on!

41:27.059 --> 41:28.391
Ty: I'm serious too!

41:28.411 --> 41:29.795
Amy: I just don't
wanna end up like Lou and Peter, okay?

41:29.815 --> 41:32.250
Always tiptoeing around the truth,
making things so much harder.

41:32.285 --> 41:35.119
- Ty: Yup.
- Amy: And grandpa and Lisa,

41:35.154 --> 41:38.555
they're just avoiding
the issues altogether.

41:38.590 --> 41:41.292
Ty: Well, if we're gonna be totally honest,

41:41.326 --> 41:42.894
there's something I gotta show you.

41:42.928 --> 41:45.296
Hold on a second.

41:45.330 --> 41:47.631
(Door clicks open and shut)

41:50.435 --> 41:52.369
Amy: (Amused) Okay...

41:52.404 --> 41:56.206
Are you taking a trip... to the 1960s?

41:56.240 --> 41:59.343
Ty: Uh, no.
I told Caleb I burned his cheque

41:59.377 --> 42:00.944
and he gave me this to make
sure that my money's safe

42:00.978 --> 42:02.974
in case the whole thing with Jesse...

42:02.994 --> 42:04.381
(Unzips bag) goes up in his face.

42:04.416 --> 42:06.883
Amy: What?! Oh my... (Money bundles rustle)

42:06.918 --> 42:09.219
Are you serious?!

42:09.253 --> 42:11.188
Ty: Yeah, I'm serious. Look at it all.

42:11.222 --> 42:13.856
- Not too shabby, huh?
- Amy: Not too shabby at all.

42:13.890 --> 42:16.125
So... what-what is your plan?

42:16.159 --> 42:18.127
What're you gonna do with all this?

42:18.161 --> 42:20.863
Ty: Wrong question.

42:20.897 --> 42:23.232
We're about to get married, right?

42:23.266 --> 42:25.600
So the right question is,
what're we gonna do with this...

42:25.635 --> 42:27.469
(Kiss)

42:27.503 --> 42:29.271
- Ty: Together?
- Amy: Right.

42:29.306 --> 42:33.074
What are we gonna do with this?

42:33.108 --> 42:36.244
Ty: (Whispers) I have no idea.
Amy: (Laughs)

42:36.278 --> 42:38.870
- Ty: (Laughing) Woo-hoo!
- Amy: (Laughing hysterically)

43:32.900 --> 43:34.822
You're not afraid of a
harmless ball python, are you?

43:34.842 --> 43:36.949
Announcer: A new friend slips away.

43:36.969 --> 43:38.525
And so does a marriage.

43:38.545 --> 43:41.098
There's something keeping
you in Vancouver away from me.

43:41.118 --> 43:42.290
She's toying with us.
