WEBVTT

00:13.013 --> 00:15.276
You really think
we should be here?

00:15.276 --> 00:17.495
What if we get caught?

00:17.495 --> 00:19.932
Look... when it's your
last night in town,

00:19.932 --> 00:21.673
you can do whatever you want,
all right?

00:21.673 --> 00:23.545
You can play tiddlywinks
for all I care.

00:23.545 --> 00:25.677
But... me?

00:25.677 --> 00:28.332
I want to have a night
I can remember.

00:28.332 --> 00:30.378
You really think Tacoma's
gonna be that bad?

00:30.378 --> 00:32.249
Look, I didn't
come here to talk!

00:32.249 --> 00:34.295
OK?
I came here to have fun.

00:34.295 --> 00:36.993
So can we have a good time?

00:51.181 --> 00:53.792
Hey, do you hear that?

00:56.143 --> 00:58.101
Hear what?

01:23.300 --> 01:25.172
Check out, Bozo.

01:25.172 --> 01:26.651
Who?

01:26.651 --> 01:29.132
That clown over there
in that tent.

01:29.132 --> 01:31.091
What tent?

01:37.575 --> 01:39.360
Hee hee.

01:39.360 --> 01:41.057
<i>Who's there?</i>

01:41.057 --> 01:42.232
<i>Carnival's closed!</i>
- Security guard's coming.

01:42.232 --> 01:43.451
Hide!
- Hey!

01:51.241 --> 01:53.287
<i>Hey, kid, come back here!</i>

01:58.074 --> 01:59.989
Hello?

02:39.289 --> 02:41.248
Hello?

02:46.253 --> 02:48.037
Hello?

02:56.828 --> 02:58.439
Who's there?

03:48.053 --> 03:49.707
<i>Hunting's
a dishonest business.</i>

03:49.707 --> 03:52.101
<i>You gotta lie all the time</i>

03:52.101 --> 03:54.451
<i>about who you are
and what you do.</i>

03:54.451 --> 03:55.800
<i>But the hardest lies</i>

03:55.800 --> 03:57.672
<i>aren't the ones
you tell other people.</i>

03:57.672 --> 03:59.500
<i>They're the ones
you tell yourself.</i>

03:59.500 --> 04:02.720
Another day looking for this
mystery man and still nothing.

04:02.720 --> 04:05.375
It's like this guy's a ghost.

04:05.375 --> 04:07.551
At least we did find
some killer sandwiches.

04:07.551 --> 04:09.553
Well, if sandwiches
could kill the Akrida queen,

04:09.553 --> 04:10.641
then we'd be all set.

04:10.641 --> 04:12.121
I'm just saying,
I don't think

04:12.121 --> 04:14.123
Lata and Carlos
are eating like this.

04:14.123 --> 04:16.517
Besides, we're gonna
find that guy--I know it.

04:18.083 --> 04:19.346
Oh, my God.

04:19.346 --> 04:20.956
I appreciate the positivity.

04:20.956 --> 04:22.697
But are you sure
you're all right?

04:22.697 --> 04:24.525
I mean, you were pretty aggressive

04:24.525 --> 04:26.091
with the bartender
back there.

04:26.091 --> 04:28.224
I just thought he was
holding out on us, that's all.

04:28.224 --> 04:29.921
Seriously, though,
you gotta try this.

04:29.921 --> 04:32.533
No, and the gas station
attendant from before.

04:32.533 --> 04:33.838
Are you sure you're all right

04:33.838 --> 04:35.536
with everything that
happened in Lawrence?

04:35.536 --> 04:37.364
Yeah, I will be, OK?

04:37.364 --> 04:39.148
All right?
Once my mom and Betty

04:39.148 --> 04:41.281
find evidence
to clear my name, uh...

04:41.281 --> 04:43.370
be able to put all
this in the rearview.

04:43.370 --> 04:45.720
Rearview?

04:45.720 --> 04:47.635
It's like you're pretending
nothing ever happened.

04:47.635 --> 04:49.463
Hey, look, I am sorry

04:49.463 --> 04:51.465
if you're upset that I don't
feel worse about this, OK?

04:51.465 --> 04:53.510
Maybe it's the fact that
we left Lawrence or that--

04:53.510 --> 04:55.251
I don't know--we get to
spend a moment alone together.

04:55.251 --> 04:57.035
- Yeah, but John--
- Hey, Mary, can you please

04:57.035 --> 04:59.516
just accept that I'm OK?

05:02.127 --> 05:03.390
Oh.

05:03.390 --> 05:06.697
Did we... interrupt something?

05:06.697 --> 05:08.612
I'd like to say
the answer is yes, Lata,

05:08.612 --> 05:10.614
but thank you for making
things more awkward.

05:10.614 --> 05:12.268
So what's up?

05:12.268 --> 05:14.836
Did you guys find anything
on the mystery man?

05:14.836 --> 05:17.447
Nope.
But we did find a new mystery.

05:17.447 --> 05:20.494
Wally Gorman,
last seen two nights ago

05:20.494 --> 05:22.670
at a traveling carnival
in town.

05:22.670 --> 05:24.585
Apparently,
he was with a friend

05:24.585 --> 05:27.675
trespassing after hours
when he vanished.

05:27.675 --> 05:29.851
People run away with
the carnival all the time.

05:29.851 --> 05:31.722
I mean, what makes you
think this is a case?

05:31.722 --> 05:33.594
Two words--creepy clown.

05:33.594 --> 05:35.422
And, according to
that news report,

05:35.422 --> 05:38.163
Wally was the only one
to see it.

05:38.163 --> 05:39.469
I say we check it out.

05:39.469 --> 05:41.515
At least we can do
some good before we go.

05:41.515 --> 05:43.647
So that's it?
You just...

05:43.647 --> 05:45.867
you just wanna give up?
- No one's giving up.

05:45.867 --> 05:47.869
My dad and Ada are still
looking for magic

05:47.869 --> 05:49.523
to kill the Akrida queen.

05:49.523 --> 05:51.263
And last we spoke,
they split up,

05:51.263 --> 05:52.874
but Ada said she was close.

05:52.874 --> 05:56.486
So I think in the meantime,
this kid could use our help.

05:56.486 --> 05:58.488
OK, well, then I guess
I'll just go easy

05:58.488 --> 06:00.621
on the sword-swallower
and tattooed man.

06:49.844 --> 06:54.544
Try not to cry
in your cauldrons, ladies.

06:54.544 --> 06:59.419
Full house--
pentacles and swords.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.898
Ha ha ha ha.
- Sorry,

07:00.898 --> 07:03.031
but that's all the
adder's fork I can part with.

07:03.031 --> 07:05.207
- Aw!
- This witch is out.

07:05.207 --> 07:08.123
Oh, sure, fly away
on your broomstick

07:08.123 --> 07:11.431
just when it's getting interesting.

07:14.695 --> 07:17.654
If you need another
player, I'm happy to join.

07:17.654 --> 07:19.090
This game is for

07:19.090 --> 07:21.745
professional purveyors
of magic only,

07:21.745 --> 07:27.403
not amateurs who used to
moonlight as bookstore owners.

07:27.403 --> 07:29.144
You know who I am?

07:29.144 --> 07:30.624
Ada Monroe,

07:30.624 --> 07:32.539
associate of Men of Letters

07:32.539 --> 07:35.716
and witch with the green thumb

07:35.716 --> 07:37.631
who prefers pruning her demons

07:37.631 --> 07:39.720
instead of sending them
straight back to Hell

07:39.720 --> 07:41.765
where they belong.

07:43.898 --> 07:45.856
If you're saying
my magic is no good here,

07:45.856 --> 07:48.729
then I can just go.
- I guess that depends

07:48.729 --> 07:50.426
on what it is.

07:52.820 --> 07:54.952
Seed of Nightshade,

07:54.952 --> 07:58.739
tended under the full moon.

07:58.739 --> 07:59.827
Hmm.

07:59.827 --> 08:02.917
More... earth magic.
how quaint.

08:05.659 --> 08:10.402
But I do like to keep
things interesting.

08:25.287 --> 08:27.811
<i>♪ Everybody
loves a clown ♪</i>

08:27.811 --> 08:29.944
<i>♪ So why don't you? ♪</i>

08:32.773 --> 08:36.951
<i>♪ Everybody laughs at the
things that I say and do ♪</i>

08:38.039 --> 08:39.475
Don't you just
love carnivals?

08:39.475 --> 08:40.694
Which part?

08:40.694 --> 08:41.912
Being surrounded
by screaming kids

08:41.912 --> 08:43.740
or adults trying to fix
whatever problems

08:43.740 --> 08:47.091
they have in their life
by winning a stuffed giraffe?

08:50.530 --> 08:52.314
What about you two?

08:52.314 --> 08:54.664
I mean, any thoughts
on all this fun?

08:54.664 --> 08:56.231
Look.

09:00.452 --> 09:02.672
Wally saw a clown, right?

09:02.672 --> 09:05.545
Could be a good place to start.

09:08.373 --> 09:09.853
Hi, excuse me?

09:09.853 --> 09:11.986
We're interns
at the "Fort Wayne Examiner"

09:11.986 --> 09:13.683
and our boss told us to do
a follow-up story

09:13.683 --> 09:15.729
on the kid who went missing
the other night.

09:15.729 --> 09:18.514
I already told the paper and
the cops everything I know.

09:18.514 --> 09:20.951
Most importantly,
I was nowhere near that kid

09:20.951 --> 09:22.779
when he went missing.

09:22.779 --> 09:24.781
And I got a bar full of people

09:24.781 --> 09:27.305
I was passed out
in front of to prove it.

09:27.305 --> 09:30.265
Well, there must be something
that you could tell us,

09:30.265 --> 09:32.397
like if you or any
of your carny friends

09:32.397 --> 09:34.225
have any theories.

09:34.225 --> 09:37.185
A couple a ride boys who run
the Tilt-a-Whirl have an idea.

09:37.185 --> 09:40.101
But I have a feeling
your boss at the paper

09:40.101 --> 09:42.886
wouldn't have the guts
to print it.

09:42.886 --> 09:44.409
Why?
What do they think happened?

09:44.409 --> 09:47.891
They say that kid's
the latest victim of Limbo.

09:47.891 --> 09:50.067
Limbo the Clown.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.639
Um... I'll probably regret
asking this later,

09:56.639 --> 09:57.858
but, uh, who's that?

09:57.858 --> 10:00.077
Limbo is a...

10:00.077 --> 10:01.818
carnival urban legend.

10:01.818 --> 10:03.733
No one knows if there's
a man or a monster

10:03.733 --> 10:05.213
under that greasepaint.

10:05.213 --> 10:08.346
He goes from carnival to
carnival pitching his tent--

10:08.346 --> 10:11.741
Limbo's Hall of Happy--
and luring folks inside.

10:11.741 --> 10:15.527
And once he does,
no one ever sees you again.

10:19.706 --> 10:21.011
Now...

10:23.057 --> 10:24.754
Sorry to let things
get out of hand...

10:26.147 --> 10:28.845
But I've
gotta go make a living.

10:31.761 --> 10:33.763
OK. Granted, Limbo
the kidnapping clown--

10:33.763 --> 10:35.286
terrifying.

10:35.286 --> 10:37.332
But could any of you
take that guy seriously?

10:37.332 --> 10:39.856
- At least it's a start.
- I'll head back to the motel

10:39.856 --> 10:42.206
and see if I can
find anything in the lore.

10:42.206 --> 10:44.513
OK. 'Losi, why don't
you go with Lata--

10:44.513 --> 10:46.123
Actually,
I'm gonna go with Lata.

10:46.123 --> 10:48.125
So why don't you
stay with Mary?

10:53.565 --> 10:55.132
I--

11:08.798 --> 11:11.583
I see your bones...

11:11.583 --> 11:13.629
and I raise you.

11:14.804 --> 11:17.938
All in.
- Ah.

11:17.938 --> 11:21.376
That's too rich for
this witch's blood.

11:21.376 --> 11:22.551
I fold too.

11:25.946 --> 11:29.036
I'll bite.

11:33.518 --> 11:36.739
Let's see what the
Fates have given you.

11:37.914 --> 11:39.481
Full house.

11:39.481 --> 11:41.004
Mmm.

11:45.400 --> 11:48.533
Straight flush.

11:51.972 --> 11:54.104
I tried to warn you

11:54.104 --> 11:57.020
that our game
was out of your league.

11:57.020 --> 11:59.327
I just--please,
just let me--

11:59.327 --> 12:02.025
let me borrow some magic to
try to win some of it back.

12:02.025 --> 12:04.985
I promise I'm good for it.

12:04.985 --> 12:06.247
Oh.

12:06.247 --> 12:08.292
This isn't just about
some more

12:08.292 --> 12:12.470
seeds and bones, now is it?

12:12.470 --> 12:16.039
I know this game attracts
powerful magic users.

12:16.039 --> 12:17.998
And I need some of it.

12:19.216 --> 12:21.741
I need it to stop
the Akrida queen,

12:21.741 --> 12:23.003
to defeat their invasion.

12:23.003 --> 12:25.875
Ha.

12:27.442 --> 12:29.226
- The Akrida?
- Yes.

12:29.226 --> 12:31.185
No one knows when that
invasion's gonna happen.

12:31.185 --> 12:33.753
But when it does,
it can't be stopped.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.624
They're too powerful.

12:35.624 --> 12:37.234
She's right.

12:37.234 --> 12:41.064
Find a coven to join--not
that anyone here is offering.

12:41.064 --> 12:43.284
Enough dark magic users

12:43.284 --> 12:45.373
should be
able to protect each other

12:45.373 --> 12:48.289
from the storm those bugs
are going to whip up.

12:48.289 --> 12:50.421
I can't do that.
I have friends, I have family

12:50.421 --> 12:51.945
that I have to think about. Please.

12:51.945 --> 12:55.296
There has to be something
that can stop them.

12:55.296 --> 12:57.037
Please.

12:57.037 --> 12:59.256
Prove

12:59.256 --> 13:03.304
you are powerful enough
to wield that kind of magic,

13:03.304 --> 13:06.307
and maybe, perhaps,
we'll let you stay.

13:06.307 --> 13:07.917
OK. How?

13:11.094 --> 13:12.922
Make it grow.

13:12.922 --> 13:15.577
No water, no dirt.

13:15.577 --> 13:18.058
Just magic.

13:59.316 --> 14:02.842
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

14:02.842 --> 14:04.626
Amateur hour is over.

14:04.626 --> 14:07.585
Ha ha ha ha ha!

14:07.585 --> 14:11.415
Don't let the warded door
hit you on the way out.

14:19.510 --> 14:21.295
Ada Monroe?

14:21.295 --> 14:24.037
I heard about
what you're after,

14:24.037 --> 14:26.169
and I can help
for the right price.

14:26.169 --> 14:28.215
Who are you?

14:28.215 --> 14:31.696
I'm your new best pal.

14:32.741 --> 14:34.221
My name is Rowena.

14:40.401 --> 14:42.316
These are all
from the library?

14:42.316 --> 14:44.753
There aren't many holes
in my lore collection,

14:44.753 --> 14:48.191
but I'm afraid carnival
lore is one of them.

14:48.191 --> 14:52.848
"Folklore
of the American Carnival."

14:52.848 --> 14:57.200
"Clowning Around: A History
from Alfie to Zappo."

14:57.200 --> 14:59.159
You really think
there's gonna be

14:59.159 --> 15:01.770
stuff about Limbo in here?

15:01.770 --> 15:03.293
Before we see,

15:03.293 --> 15:05.469
I wanted to check in

15:05.469 --> 15:08.081
after everything
that's happened.

15:09.212 --> 15:10.648
Right.

15:11.867 --> 15:15.088
Is this... you checking?

15:15.088 --> 15:17.525
Or did Mary put you up to this?

15:17.525 --> 15:19.483
Whatever is going
on between the two of you

15:19.483 --> 15:21.398
is none of my business.

15:21.398 --> 15:25.750
I'm asking because
you're my friend.

15:29.189 --> 15:31.756
I'm good.

15:31.756 --> 15:33.280
Yeah.

15:35.151 --> 15:37.023
Thanks.

15:47.337 --> 15:50.253
I see no sign of Limbo's
Hall of Happy anywhere.

15:50.253 --> 15:51.559
So what now?

15:51.559 --> 15:53.517
We get to the
important stuff,

15:53.517 --> 15:56.172
like you spilling on what
you and soldier boyfriend

15:56.172 --> 15:58.044
were fighting about
back at the motel.

15:58.044 --> 15:59.741
Let's just say being
accused of murder

15:59.741 --> 16:02.178
hasn't exactly helped John
with his anger issues.

16:02.178 --> 16:04.398
He's in total denial.

16:04.398 --> 16:07.140
Everybody processes
trauma differently.

16:07.140 --> 16:09.185
At least,
that's what Dr. Z says.

16:09.185 --> 16:10.491
I just wish I knew
how to help.

16:10.491 --> 16:12.319
Well, timing's
definitely not great.

16:12.319 --> 16:14.103
If Ada finds that magic,

16:14.103 --> 16:16.584
we'll definitely have an Akrida
fight on our hands soon.

16:18.412 --> 16:20.675
I'm just
so worried about him.

16:26.376 --> 16:29.162
Everything's gonna be OK.
All right?

16:29.162 --> 16:31.033
We're in this together.
- I know.

16:31.033 --> 16:33.253
So just keep pretending like
you're comforting me anyways.

16:33.253 --> 16:36.169
- Wait, what?
- Someone's following us.

16:36.169 --> 16:39.476
Over my shoulder, 1:00.

16:41.304 --> 16:42.827
Oh, damn it.
He made me.

16:42.827 --> 16:44.742
Quick!

16:44.742 --> 16:47.441
Oh, I think
I found something.

16:48.616 --> 16:51.836
Limbo's real name
was Jerome Haskins,

16:51.836 --> 16:53.882
and he was a part of
a carnival that traveled

16:53.882 --> 16:56.189
the Midwest in the 1920s.

16:56.189 --> 16:58.408
Says here he was one
of the main attractions.

16:58.408 --> 17:00.541
Until the one-two punch
of the Dust Bowl

17:00.541 --> 17:03.326
and Depression hit, and the
entire carnival went under.

17:03.326 --> 17:05.850
Well, they say every
clown has a sad story.

17:05.850 --> 17:07.287
Now, we know his.

17:07.287 --> 17:09.245
Except that wasn't
the end of it.

17:09.245 --> 17:10.855
According to legend,

17:10.855 --> 17:13.684
Haskins searched out
a powerful occultist

17:13.684 --> 17:17.514
and asked to trade
his soul for dark magic.

17:17.514 --> 17:19.777
Let me guess.
He wasn't asking for

17:19.777 --> 17:22.389
a shiny new nose
and clown shoes?

17:23.129 --> 17:24.478
No.

17:24.478 --> 17:26.001
It was for a spell

17:26.001 --> 17:27.785
to make him forget
all of his problems

17:27.785 --> 17:32.442
and freeze him like that,
so he could stay happy forever.

17:36.229 --> 17:37.230
There.

17:49.981 --> 17:52.158
Who are you,
and why are you following us?

17:52.158 --> 17:55.422
Because I wanted to know
what you found out about Limbo.

17:55.422 --> 17:57.815
And I don't trust reporters.

17:57.815 --> 17:59.382
Reporters?

17:59.382 --> 18:02.124
From the "Fort Wayne
Examiner," remember?

18:03.386 --> 18:05.345
Oh! Ha...

18:05.345 --> 18:07.782
Of course.
Never mind.

18:07.782 --> 18:10.393
So why do you care
so much about Limbo?

18:10.393 --> 18:11.960
Is it about Wally,
the missing kid?

18:11.960 --> 18:16.878
No, somebody else--
my little brother Roger.

18:18.227 --> 18:21.230
Limbo took him 30 years ago.

18:28.281 --> 18:30.239
So you're not
really reporters.

18:30.239 --> 18:31.632
You're Monster Hunters?

18:31.632 --> 18:33.373
It's something that we
don't like to advertise

18:33.373 --> 18:35.984
for obvious reasons.
- Could you tell us more about

18:35.984 --> 18:38.117
what happened to your
brother, Clarence?

18:38.117 --> 18:40.336
I was 18

18:40.336 --> 18:43.034
and Roger was 10

18:43.034 --> 18:45.298
when our parents
died in a car crash.

18:45.298 --> 18:47.648
Growing up eight years apart,

18:47.648 --> 18:50.346
we were never close,
so I didn't know what to do--

18:50.346 --> 18:52.870
how to help him through
his grief, you know?

18:52.870 --> 18:55.960
So instead,
a day after the funeral,

18:55.960 --> 18:59.529
I took him to the carnival
to try and cheer him up.

18:59.529 --> 19:02.053
It only made things worse.

19:02.053 --> 19:03.620
And he ran off.

19:03.620 --> 19:05.709
I looked everywhere.

19:06.971 --> 19:08.669
But all I found
was this little girl.

19:08.669 --> 19:12.586
She said
she'd seen Roger vanish,

19:12.586 --> 19:15.110
like he just disappeared.

19:15.110 --> 19:17.025
Did you try
telling the police?

19:17.025 --> 19:18.809
They thought the little
girl was seeing things

19:18.809 --> 19:21.464
and eventually stopped
searching for Roger

19:21.464 --> 19:24.380
and gave up.
But I didn't.

19:24.380 --> 19:29.124
That's when I heard of
the Legend of Limbo.

19:31.126 --> 19:33.302
If only I'd helped him
through his grief

19:33.302 --> 19:37.393
instead of taking him
to that damn carnival,

19:37.393 --> 19:39.569
he'd be here right now.

19:43.356 --> 19:45.793
You were just a kid too.

19:45.793 --> 19:49.449
I lost both of
my parents to monsters.

19:49.449 --> 19:51.755
I know how hard it is.

19:51.755 --> 19:54.410
Maybe that's it.
According to the paper,

19:54.410 --> 19:56.543
Wally was upset because his
parents were getting divorced

19:56.543 --> 19:58.109
and forcing him to move.

19:58.109 --> 20:00.895
And now we know that
Roger was upset too.

20:00.895 --> 20:03.985
So you think Limbo's
targeting his victims?

20:03.985 --> 20:06.596
Searching for people who are
sad or dealing with grief

20:06.596 --> 20:08.555
and luring them into his tent?

20:08.555 --> 20:10.339
I think
he's adding to his troupe.

20:10.339 --> 20:12.036
Well, we're gonna
find your brother.

20:12.036 --> 20:14.038
You don't have much time.
The carnival starts

20:14.038 --> 20:16.345
pulling up stakes tonight,
and once it's gone,

20:16.345 --> 20:17.738
there's
no telling where or when

20:17.738 --> 20:19.305
Limbo will strike next.

20:19.305 --> 20:21.045
Then we need to figure
out what kind of magic

20:21.045 --> 20:22.830
we're up against, stat.
- I'm on it.

20:22.830 --> 20:24.788
I was able to
identify the occultist

20:24.788 --> 20:26.399
Limbo made a deal with.

20:26.399 --> 20:27.704
Hopefully,
digging into his lore

20:27.704 --> 20:29.663
will lead to how to defeat Limbo.

20:29.663 --> 20:32.361
I know I'm no Monster Hunter,

20:32.361 --> 20:34.450
but have some research
on Limbo,

20:34.450 --> 20:36.409
things I've gathered
searching for Roger.

20:36.409 --> 20:38.237
OK. Great.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.848
So Carlos, you go with Clarence
and grab everything he's got,

20:40.848 --> 20:42.937
and then meet Lata
back at the motel.

20:42.937 --> 20:44.678
John and I are gonna
stay here and make sure

20:44.678 --> 20:47.594
that Limbo doesn't snatch
anyone else up before he goes.

20:55.384 --> 20:56.864
Here it is.

21:00.084 --> 21:03.305
The grimoire you say the Men
of Letters stole from you.

21:03.305 --> 21:05.525
Ah, yes!

21:05.525 --> 21:07.048
My old grimoire.

21:07.048 --> 21:08.919
Yes, which means
it's now your turn

21:08.919 --> 21:10.921
to fulfill
your end of the bargain.

21:11.835 --> 21:13.315
You promised me magic

21:13.315 --> 21:16.057
powerful enough
to kill the Akrida queen.

21:16.057 --> 21:17.580
That I did.

21:17.580 --> 21:21.149
But there's just one teeny,
weeny, wee little problem.

21:23.238 --> 21:25.980
This was never my grimoire.

21:25.980 --> 21:28.461
I lied.
Terrible of me, I know.

21:28.461 --> 21:30.201
But I had to make sure

21:30.201 --> 21:32.769
you let me through
that heavily warded door.

21:35.076 --> 21:36.556
Why?

21:36.556 --> 21:39.167
What do the Men of Letters
have here that you want?

21:39.167 --> 21:43.258
Not the Men of Letters,
Ada Monroe.

21:44.128 --> 21:45.478
You.

21:48.524 --> 21:51.571
Those hags may have dismissed
your green-thumbed magic,

21:51.571 --> 21:53.529
but not me.

21:54.878 --> 21:58.665
I'm here for the demon
you trapped in a plant.

22:00.057 --> 22:02.408
So now that you got me
alone, what's the plan?

22:02.408 --> 22:03.626
Wanna grill me again?

22:03.626 --> 22:05.193
Try to figure out
why I'm not as upset

22:05.193 --> 22:06.629
as you think I should be?

22:06.629 --> 22:09.197
After investigating this
case, I think I know why.

22:09.197 --> 22:11.504
Really?
And why is that?

22:12.331 --> 22:14.202
What if it's us?

22:14.202 --> 22:15.812
What if our relationship
is the problem?

22:15.812 --> 22:17.988
Wanna tell me how
Hunting an evil clown

22:17.988 --> 22:20.208
suddenly makes you think
we have issues?

22:20.208 --> 22:21.775
Not hunting Limbo.

22:21.775 --> 22:24.517
Talking to Clarence about
what happened to his brother.

22:24.517 --> 22:25.909
Mary, that doesn't make
any sense.

22:25.909 --> 22:27.650
Clarence used
the carnival as an escape

22:27.650 --> 22:29.522
so his brother wouldn't
have to face his problems.

22:29.522 --> 22:30.784
Don't you think it's possible

22:30.784 --> 22:32.176
that you've
been using our relationship

22:32.176 --> 22:34.135
in the same way?
- OK, so our relationship

22:34.135 --> 22:36.006
is a circus carnival
in this metaphor.

22:36.006 --> 22:37.660
No.
It's something happy

22:37.660 --> 22:40.097
to distract you
from your issues.

22:40.097 --> 22:42.970
And it's been working, because
ever since we left Lawrence,

22:42.970 --> 22:45.146
you've been pretending that
we've been on vacation together

22:45.146 --> 22:46.713
instead of on the run
for Kyle's murder.

22:46.713 --> 22:48.845
Either that,
or you're flying off the handle

22:48.845 --> 22:51.282
because it's like you're
totally ignoring reality.

22:51.282 --> 22:52.588
I'm ignoring reality?

22:52.588 --> 22:54.329
You're honestly gonna
stand here

22:54.329 --> 22:56.287
and act like you're
not avoiding your issues, too?

22:56.287 --> 22:58.681
OK, what about life
after Hunting or us?

22:58.681 --> 23:00.770
Well, I applied to college,
and I got in.

23:00.770 --> 23:02.337
Great. And then what
have you done since?

23:02.337 --> 23:03.556
Have you accepted the offer?

23:03.556 --> 23:05.122
Have you enrolled
for any classes?

23:05.122 --> 23:06.689
Have you taken a second
to think about

23:06.689 --> 23:08.256
how any of this works
if I'm still Hunting?

23:08.256 --> 23:09.736
Sorry I'm too busy
trying to save the world.

23:09.736 --> 23:11.651
There it is, Mary,
the eternal excuse.

23:11.651 --> 23:13.479
I mean, admit it--the second
your future got real,

23:13.479 --> 23:14.784
you did what you always do.

23:14.784 --> 23:16.351
You buried your head
in the Hunting sand

23:16.351 --> 23:17.700
so you wouldn't have
to think about college

23:17.700 --> 23:19.398
or our relationship.
- You know what?

23:19.398 --> 23:21.487
Think what you want.
I don't have time for this.

23:21.487 --> 23:24.403
And there you go,
proving my point.

23:32.236 --> 23:34.151
It's Limbo.

23:34.151 --> 23:36.458
I think he's here.

23:36.458 --> 23:37.807
OK.

23:37.807 --> 23:39.940
Walkie if you see any
sign of him or the tent.

23:39.940 --> 23:41.507
Don't you think
we should stick together?

23:41.507 --> 23:42.769
Why bother?

23:42.769 --> 23:43.900
I'm probably just
sticking my head

23:43.900 --> 23:46.163
in that Hunting sand, right?

24:15.149 --> 24:17.891
<i>John, I found Limbo's tent.</i>

24:17.891 --> 24:20.459
I'm going in.
- Mary, wait for me.

24:20.459 --> 24:21.982
I'll be right there.

24:28.989 --> 24:30.599
Mary!

24:34.124 --> 24:35.778
Mary!

24:43.220 --> 24:44.526
Mary.

24:46.963 --> 24:48.356
Mary.

25:02.544 --> 25:03.937
<i>At one moment,
she's radioing me.</i>

25:03.937 --> 25:05.634
The next, she's
vanishing into thin air.

25:05.634 --> 25:08.028
There was no sign of Limbo
or his tent anywhere.

25:08.028 --> 25:11.074
Just like with
Wally and Roger.

25:11.074 --> 25:12.728
Do you think Limbo
was targeting her

25:12.728 --> 25:14.513
the way he was targeting them?

25:14.513 --> 25:16.602
Except for one detail
that doesn't make any sense.

25:16.602 --> 25:19.996
I mean, Mary wasn't upset like
the others when it happened.

25:22.782 --> 25:24.697
Unless she was.

25:24.697 --> 25:26.655
OK, look,
we got into a fight.

25:26.655 --> 25:28.352
But neither one of us realized
what it was going to lead to.

25:28.352 --> 25:30.180
All right,
we need to find her.

25:30.180 --> 25:31.791
And we also need to
find a way to defeat Limbo

25:31.791 --> 25:34.097
before the carnival goes
and he goes with it.

25:34.097 --> 25:36.883
OK. I think I might have
some ideas

25:36.883 --> 25:39.842
based on the information
I found on the occultist

25:39.842 --> 25:42.062
that Limbo made a deal with.

25:42.062 --> 25:44.455
Limbo's happiness
is the result of a mirror

25:44.455 --> 25:46.588
that was given to him
by the occultist

25:46.588 --> 25:48.372
that's enchanted by dark magic.

25:48.372 --> 25:50.592
And he can only
maintain that happiness

25:50.592 --> 25:52.507
by spreading it to others.

25:52.507 --> 25:54.988
That must be why
Limbo kidnaps people.

25:54.988 --> 25:57.686
The good news is while
Limbo's happiness is absolute,

25:57.686 --> 26:01.472
it's also very fragile because
if anyone from his troupe

26:01.472 --> 26:04.040
were to be convinced to
embrace reality again,

26:04.040 --> 26:05.346
then Limbo would be destroyed

26:05.346 --> 26:07.957
and all of his victims
set free.

26:07.957 --> 26:09.872
Great. So we crash
Limbo's happy party,

26:09.872 --> 26:11.526
avoid looking into his
mirror, and we talk

26:11.526 --> 26:13.397
some sense into one of them.
- Yeah.

26:13.397 --> 26:15.617
We just need to
figure out how to find

26:15.617 --> 26:17.576
a tent that we can't see.

26:17.576 --> 26:18.925
Why don't we get Limbo
to target one of us?

26:18.925 --> 26:21.449
I know I'm pretty
upset with Jonathan

26:21.449 --> 26:22.972
now that Mary's missing.

26:22.972 --> 26:24.844
Playing into his hand
can't be a good idea.

26:24.844 --> 26:28.325
There has to be another
way to gain admission.

26:28.325 --> 26:31.024
Admission.

26:31.024 --> 26:33.330
When Mary went missing,
she found this ticket.

26:33.330 --> 26:36.116
It's like it appeared
right after our fight.

26:36.116 --> 26:39.075
Perhaps it's only
offered once a person has

26:39.075 --> 26:41.164
been primed for Limbo's spell.

26:41.164 --> 26:44.080
I think I may know
where to find one.

26:45.865 --> 26:48.302
Clarence had a bunch of
old Limbo memorabilia

26:48.302 --> 26:50.130
along with all of his research.

26:52.567 --> 26:57.311
Here, an old ticket to
Limbo's Hall of Happy.

26:58.878 --> 27:01.054
You think it'll work?

27:01.054 --> 27:05.188
It better, because
we don't have much time

27:05.188 --> 27:07.713
until the carnival is gone.

27:09.497 --> 27:16.373
So much evil
in such a small package.

27:16.373 --> 27:20.116
It practically
radiates darkness.

27:20.116 --> 27:22.858
Ohh...

27:22.858 --> 27:25.252
I can feel it.

27:25.252 --> 27:27.733
The demon
wasn't part of our deal.

27:27.733 --> 27:30.170
Why do you even want it?
Are you trying to play

27:30.170 --> 27:31.606
both sides against the middle
here, like--

27:31.606 --> 27:33.739
Dinnae get your
knickers in a twist, hen.

27:33.739 --> 27:37.046
This has nothing to do with
the Akrida, I can assure you.

27:37.046 --> 27:40.615
You're potted little
hellraiser here

27:40.615 --> 27:42.878
has information about my son.

27:47.056 --> 27:48.667
I have a son too.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.407
But just give me the
magic you promised me,

27:50.407 --> 27:52.496
and I will let you
take the plant and go.

27:52.496 --> 27:57.893
Or...
what're you gonna do?

27:57.893 --> 28:00.200
Maybe those witches were right.

28:00.200 --> 28:04.117
Maybe you're not powerful
enough to stop the Akrida.

28:05.422 --> 28:08.382
Or me, for that matter.
- Don't.

28:10.340 --> 28:11.820
Toodles.

28:11.820 --> 28:14.344
I said, stop!

28:21.264 --> 28:24.615
Now look who's trying
to prove me wrong.

28:24.615 --> 28:27.706
I hate being wrong.

28:29.795 --> 28:31.492
Aaah!

28:41.110 --> 28:43.504
That's where
Mary disappeared.

28:43.504 --> 28:45.767
The carnival's literally
pulling up stakes.

28:45.767 --> 28:48.161
Then we all need to
grab Clarence's ticket

28:48.161 --> 28:49.597
and see if it really works.

29:20.802 --> 29:23.762
Just when you thought things
couldn't get any creepier.

29:27.417 --> 29:29.419
I don't see any sign of Mary.

29:29.419 --> 29:31.726
Or Limbo
and his clown troupe.

29:52.442 --> 29:55.968
John?
- John?

29:57.012 --> 29:59.493
John!
- John!

30:05.542 --> 30:07.501
Mary?

30:07.501 --> 30:09.503
Are you in here?

30:11.592 --> 30:14.856
Don't look into a mirror
in a maze filled with them.

30:14.856 --> 30:17.424
Fantastic.
All right.

30:26.737 --> 30:30.959
Hello, John.

30:30.959 --> 30:33.092
You ready for some fun?

30:38.053 --> 30:39.794
Where is she?

30:39.794 --> 30:42.231
Come on, John.
I can't tell you that.

30:42.231 --> 30:44.494
That would spoil the show.

30:45.365 --> 30:47.019
I said tell me where she is!

30:47.019 --> 30:49.673
Or what?

30:49.673 --> 30:51.675
You gonna hurt me, John?

30:51.675 --> 30:53.329
Because I abhor violence.

30:53.329 --> 30:56.985
I just want people to be
happy, even people like you.

30:58.595 --> 31:01.163
See, I know that you
cheated your way in here.

31:03.078 --> 31:06.125
But don't worry.

31:06.125 --> 31:08.214
I won't hold it against you.

31:08.214 --> 31:10.869
After all, you need me
as much as anyone.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.653
Yeah, I don't need you.

31:12.653 --> 31:14.481
And neither does Mary.

31:16.875 --> 31:19.747
Mary?
Are you in here?

31:19.747 --> 31:21.140
Look at you.

31:21.140 --> 31:24.665
What a smarty pants you are,
covering your eyes

31:24.665 --> 31:26.710
so you don't look into
my special mirror.

31:26.710 --> 31:29.017
But which one is it?

31:29.017 --> 31:31.237
There's so many of them.
It's so hard to tell.

31:31.237 --> 31:32.847
Mary, can you hear me?

31:34.718 --> 31:37.025
Getting warmer, John.

31:37.025 --> 31:39.636
Oh ho ho, warmer.

31:39.636 --> 31:43.684
John, you're practically
on fire now.

31:43.684 --> 31:47.122
John.

31:47.122 --> 31:49.342
- Mary.
- You came to find me.

31:49.342 --> 31:51.779
Of course. OK, look,
we have to get out of here.

31:51.779 --> 31:53.476
- John, we can't.
- What are you talking about?

31:53.476 --> 31:55.435
We'll break our way outta
this maze if we have to.

31:55.435 --> 31:58.307
No, you don't understand.
I wanna stay here.

31:58.307 --> 32:00.701
And I want you to
stay with me too.

32:00.701 --> 32:02.181
- What?
- We can be together

32:02.181 --> 32:04.139
where there aren't
any problems.

32:04.139 --> 32:06.011
And we never have
to fight again

32:06.011 --> 32:08.927
about my future or your anger.

32:08.927 --> 32:14.106
We can be happy in
Limbo's tent forever.

32:17.500 --> 32:19.763
But none of it would be real.

32:19.763 --> 32:22.070
It would all be
a part of Limbo's spell.

32:22.070 --> 32:26.161
Mary, there's a world out
there that we have to save.

32:26.161 --> 32:27.728
Not if we stay.

32:27.728 --> 32:30.209
Limbo can protect us
from all of that here.

32:30.209 --> 32:35.344
All you have to do is look
in the mirror behind me.

32:36.911 --> 32:38.826
No.

32:38.826 --> 32:40.306
We're leaving.
Come on.

32:48.227 --> 32:50.446
A bit of misdirection.

32:50.446 --> 32:53.014
I'm sorry to have
to trick you, John.

32:53.014 --> 32:54.929
But I guess the joke's on you.

32:54.929 --> 32:58.454
Now, put a smile on that face.

33:09.074 --> 33:10.945
- John!
- Come on!

33:21.956 --> 33:24.002
Oh, gross. No.

33:29.920 --> 33:32.097
Still wanna stand by
your love of carnivals?

33:32.097 --> 33:34.099
If we survive this,
I promise I'm never going

33:34.099 --> 33:36.188
to eat cotton candy again.

33:40.540 --> 33:43.369
- What are we supposed to do?
- Run!

33:49.244 --> 33:51.942
Wait.
The door.

33:51.942 --> 33:52.943
There's no way out.

34:01.996 --> 34:03.432
John?
oh, no, no, no, no, no.

34:03.432 --> 34:05.173
This is not happening.

34:05.173 --> 34:08.394
Looks like we have
more uninvited guests.

34:08.394 --> 34:10.700
Let's give them a show anyway.

34:12.659 --> 34:14.313
Make them die laughing.

34:16.445 --> 34:18.447
Mary, please, all right.

34:18.447 --> 34:20.188
You just need to listen.

34:20.188 --> 34:23.365
John? All right.

34:23.365 --> 34:25.367
Come back to reality.
Don't do this.

34:25.367 --> 34:27.891
Carlos,
they're not listening.

34:27.891 --> 34:29.589
We need to find
someplace safe to hide.

34:29.589 --> 34:31.156
They're going to rip us apart.

34:31.156 --> 34:33.419
Clown car.

34:37.727 --> 34:41.253
Shut the door.
Shut the door!

34:43.429 --> 34:45.431
Keys? Keys?

34:45.431 --> 34:47.302
Where are the keys?
- I have no idea.

34:47.302 --> 34:48.912
What do you mean?

34:48.912 --> 34:51.219
Aah!

34:51.219 --> 34:54.135
Roger?

34:54.135 --> 34:59.097
Oh, my God, we're going to
die in here, in a clown car!

35:06.930 --> 35:08.497
Roger, I know
you can hear me.

35:08.497 --> 35:10.847
I know what it's like
to lose your parents--

35:10.847 --> 35:13.894
how painful and how
chilling it all is

35:13.894 --> 35:15.417
feeling like you're
all alone in the world.

35:15.417 --> 35:17.289
And you just want that
feeling to go away.

35:17.289 --> 35:20.379
But I promise you,
you are not alone.

35:20.379 --> 35:22.598
You have a family,
just like I do,

35:22.598 --> 35:24.818
that loves you
and that misses you.

35:27.168 --> 35:29.214
And your brother Clarence?

35:29.214 --> 35:31.172
He's been looking for you
this whole time.

35:32.434 --> 35:34.393
And he never gave
up on you because--

35:34.393 --> 35:35.698
because he loves you.

35:38.048 --> 35:39.354
No, no, no, no. Hey!

35:39.354 --> 35:40.442
And he wants to
be with you again.

35:40.442 --> 35:42.314
You just have to
want that, too.

35:42.314 --> 35:43.750
Hey, cheer up in
there, kid, huh?

35:45.273 --> 35:47.232
I said, cheer up!

35:47.232 --> 35:48.755
Roger, listen to me.

35:48.755 --> 35:50.800
Do you want to see
your brother again?

35:53.238 --> 35:54.456
Yeah, I do.

35:54.456 --> 35:56.676
No, no, no, no.

35:56.676 --> 35:58.852
No, no!

35:58.852 --> 36:02.247
No!

36:18.350 --> 36:19.568
Hey.

36:19.568 --> 36:22.136
Are you two OK?

36:22.136 --> 36:24.878
Yeah.
Other than my face hurting

36:24.878 --> 36:27.402
from smiling so hard,
I think so.

36:27.402 --> 36:28.882
How about you two?

36:28.882 --> 36:30.536
Well, other than
our two best friends

36:30.536 --> 36:32.581
almost ripping us apart,

36:32.581 --> 36:35.497
yeah, pretty peachy keen.

36:47.161 --> 36:48.989
Finally!

36:48.989 --> 36:50.817
You're awake.

36:50.817 --> 36:53.385
Here, drink this.

36:53.385 --> 36:56.257
It's a nice wee cup
of my own special brew

36:56.257 --> 37:00.392
to help restore you after
all the magic you expended.

37:00.392 --> 37:01.871
Thanks...

37:01.871 --> 37:04.178
but I'll pass.

37:04.178 --> 37:06.049
Why are you still here?

37:06.049 --> 37:08.008
This was never just
about that demon,

37:08.008 --> 37:10.445
much as I'll enjoy
torturing him.

37:10.445 --> 37:15.233
It was also a test,
one you just passed.

37:15.233 --> 37:16.712
A test?

37:16.712 --> 37:20.455
To see if you were powerful
enough to join my coven.

37:20.455 --> 37:23.110
Those witches were
right about one thing.

37:23.110 --> 37:27.332
The Akrida are so powerful,
even with the right magic,

37:27.332 --> 37:30.465
stopping their invasion
may be impossible.

37:30.465 --> 37:32.815
And it's coming soon.
- Wait.

37:32.815 --> 37:36.079
You know when the queen
is opening her portal?

37:36.079 --> 37:38.691
Not exact details.

37:38.691 --> 37:40.475
I mean,
I know she needs help--

37:40.475 --> 37:43.522
something about an alignment
of five planets, or--

37:43.522 --> 37:45.915
I need the magic
you promised me.

37:45.915 --> 37:47.047
Now.

37:47.047 --> 37:48.788
Heroes.

37:50.572 --> 37:52.139
Here you are.

37:54.097 --> 37:55.751
That's it?

37:55.751 --> 37:57.971
That's supposed
to kill the queen?

37:57.971 --> 38:02.018
There is one more ingredient
that needs to be added.

38:02.018 --> 38:05.500
The good news is you don't
have to go too far to get it.

38:05.500 --> 38:08.938
The bad news is
once you use it,

38:08.938 --> 38:11.289
you'll never be quite the same.

38:11.289 --> 38:12.942
And why is that?

38:12.942 --> 38:17.164
Because the ingredient
is right here,

38:17.164 --> 38:18.252
dearie.

38:19.645 --> 38:22.125
It's a piece of your own soul.

38:35.530 --> 38:38.185
If you survive this,
Ada Monroe,

38:38.185 --> 38:40.274
look me up.

38:40.274 --> 38:43.451
You're more powerful
than you know.

38:43.451 --> 38:46.324
And I have so much
to teach you.

39:02.992 --> 39:05.691
Must be kinda weird
for both of them, right?

39:05.691 --> 39:09.347
I mean, before it was just
8 years, and now it's 38.

39:09.347 --> 39:12.698
I guess it's better than
never seeing him again.

39:14.743 --> 39:17.398
Thank you for what you did--

39:19.008 --> 39:20.662
Saving us.

39:20.662 --> 39:22.577
I kinda had no choice.

39:23.709 --> 39:25.624
I have to ask.

39:25.624 --> 39:29.584
Do the two of you remember it,
when you were clowns?

39:29.584 --> 39:31.760
Yeah, all of it.

39:34.241 --> 39:35.590
How terrifying.

39:37.026 --> 39:39.028
Actually,
it was kind of nice.

39:41.944 --> 39:45.861
Uh, Lata, let's go check
on Roger and Clarence.

39:49.082 --> 39:51.780
So do you really mean that?

39:51.780 --> 39:53.652
Didn't it feel good to you,

39:53.652 --> 39:56.568
not having to worry about
our problems for a second,

39:56.568 --> 39:58.178
not to have to worry about us?

39:58.178 --> 39:59.658
Maybe.

39:59.658 --> 40:01.616
But it also made me realize
that you were right.

40:01.616 --> 40:04.445
I have been ignoring things

40:04.445 --> 40:07.317
because it's easier
than facing the truth.

40:07.317 --> 40:09.058
I'm sorry for that.

40:09.058 --> 40:12.758
I am also sorry for being
so angry with you.

40:12.758 --> 40:15.021
I guess I got kind
of angry myself,

40:15.021 --> 40:17.893
you calling me
a hypocrite and all.

40:19.025 --> 40:20.635
But you were right too.

40:20.635 --> 40:22.507
Thinking about
the future is scary.

40:24.639 --> 40:26.380
So are we good?

40:34.388 --> 40:36.782
- Mom, what are you doing here?
- I thought you'd wanna

40:36.782 --> 40:39.045
to hear the good news.
Betty and I found a witness

40:39.045 --> 40:41.047
who can attest that Kyle
arrived at the garage

40:41.047 --> 40:44.746
after he made the 911 call
saying he was already there.

40:44.746 --> 40:45.965
I talked to a lawyer.

40:45.965 --> 40:48.620
He said it's enough
to clear you.

40:48.620 --> 40:51.100
Thank you.

40:52.188 --> 40:53.538
It'll be good to have
you home

40:53.538 --> 40:55.409
after we stop by the clubhouse.

40:55.409 --> 40:58.456
Ada's back--said she's got
something on the Akrida.

41:01.023 --> 41:04.592
So what is all this stuff?
- Star charts.

41:04.592 --> 41:06.899
I traded magic with a witch
who told me that five planets

41:06.899 --> 41:08.640
have to be in alignment
in order for the queen

41:08.640 --> 41:09.771
to open her portal.

41:09.771 --> 41:11.469
But I can't make
heads or tails of when

41:11.469 --> 41:13.296
that's supposed to happen.

41:13.296 --> 41:14.776
Maybe I can.

41:14.776 --> 41:17.649
Well, there's still the
problem of how to stop her

41:17.649 --> 41:20.695
and the entire Akrida army.

41:20.695 --> 41:22.305
That's where
the trade came in.

41:22.305 --> 41:25.352
There's supposed to be
enough magic in this crystal

41:25.352 --> 41:27.180
to kill the queen.

41:27.180 --> 41:29.617
Well, way to bury
the lede there, Ada.

41:29.617 --> 41:31.401
That's incredible.

41:31.401 --> 41:34.448
How do you know that little
crystal can do all that?

41:37.756 --> 41:39.061
I guess I'm just that good.

41:39.061 --> 41:42.021
And not a moment too soon.

41:42.021 --> 41:43.457
Why?

41:43.457 --> 41:46.242
According to this,
the planetary alignment

41:46.242 --> 41:49.594
that the queen needs
has already begun.
