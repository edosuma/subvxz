00:19.970 --> 00:24.480
&lt;LAUGHS&gt; GARRISON STEELE?

00:24.520 --> 00:27.980

00:38.740 --> 00:41.120
I LOVED YOUR LAST ONE.
ONE-ARMED SLEEPWALKER

00:41.160 --> 00:44.290
WHO TURNS OUT T BE THE KILLER.
IT WAS JUST A PIECE OF WORK.

00:44.330 --> 00:46.250
[GARRISON] YES, SHE WAS BASED
ON MY THIRD WIFE.

00:46.290 --> 00:49.170
[JAKE] DID YOU OPEN THIS?
[ROSE] SPECIAL OCCASION.

00:49.210 --> 00:50.840
[JAKE] MAL WOULDN'T EVEN OPEN
THIS FOR MY WEDDING.

00:50.880 --> 00:52.670
[GARRISON] OH C'MON JAKE,
FROM WHAT I HEAR THAT WOULD

00:52.720 --> 00:54.630
HAVE BEEN LIKE CHRISTENING
THE TITANIC.

00:54.680 --> 00:57.600
[ROSE/GARRISON] &lt;LAUGHS&gt;
[JAKE] EXCUSE ME?

00:57.640 --> 01:01.140
[GARRISON] WE'VE BEEN DIGGING
INTO THE PSYCHE OF JAKE.

01:01.180 --> 01:02.270
HEAVY STUFF.

01:02.310 --> 01:03.520
[JAKE] RIGHT.

01:03.560 --> 01:05.150
WHERE'S MAL?
[ROSE] TRIP.

01:05.190 --> 01:06.520
[GARRISON] I SPOKE TO HIM A
FEW DAYS AGO.

01:06.560 --> 01:08.230
HE SET THIS WHOLE THING UP.

01:08.270 --> 01:09.650
[JAKE] SORRY, WHAT WHOLE THING?

01:09.690 --> 01:11.400
[ROSE] MR. STEELE WOULD LIKE
OUR HELP.

01:11.440 --> 01:14.650
[GARRISON] MY BOOKS ONCE SHOT TO
THE TOP OF THE BESTSELLER LIST.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.870
STAYED THERE SO LONG
THEY HAD SQUATTERS RIGHTS.

01:16.910 --> 01:20.450
BUT THOSE DAYS ARE OVER.
NO ONE SEEMS TO WANT

01:20.490 --> 01:26.120
THE GRITTY, REALISTIC, DEEP,
HUMAN NOVELS THAT ARE
MY STOCK AND TRADE.

01:26.170 --> 01:31.130
MY PUBLISHER WANTS ME WRITING
QLCF. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

01:31.170 --> 01:34.760
[JAKE] QLCF?
[GARRISON] "QUAINT, LOCATION,
CRIME, FICTION".

01:34.800 --> 01:37.300
HE SUGGESTED I TRY
NEWFOUNDLAND.

01:37.340 --> 01:39.850
THE SEAFOOD SEEMS PASSABLE
AND YOU SPEAK SOMETHING LIKE

01:39.890 --> 01:42.100
ENGLISH, SO I AGREED.

01:42.140 --> 01:43.310
[JAKE] YOU WANNA INTERVIEW US?

01:43.350 --> 01:46.100
[GARRISON] I DON'T DO
INTERVIEWS.

01:46.140 --> 01:47.810
I LIVE THE LIFE I WRITE ABOUT.

01:47.850 --> 01:50.690
[JAKE] REALLY? SO I GUESS THE
DETECTIVE WHO'S SLEEPING WITH

01:50.730 --> 01:54.190

WIFE, THE COP AND THE CLIENT

01:54.240 --> 01:57.030

A FEW DAYS. I'M AFRAID IT'S
GONNA BE YOU AND MR. STEELE.

02:12.300 --> 02:15.220
[GARRISON] I PAID YOUR FATHER
A HANDSOME FEE. SO IT LOOKS

02:15.260 --> 02:20.260
LIKE IT'S YOU AND ME KID.
[ROSE] CHEERS.

02:20.300 --> 02:22.310

IF THIS IS A MISSING PERSONS
MR. EBNER YOU PROBABLY JUST
WANNA CALL THE COPS.

03:25.700 --> 03:30.290
[DARYL] NO, NO, NO.
SHE'S JUST GONE ON A BENDER.

03:30.330 --> 03:35.880
GRACE HAS BEEN KNOWN TO
HAVE THE OCCASIONAL
DALLIES WITH OTHER MEN.

03:35.920 --> 03:39.380
HER LATEST IS BRUCE BORDEN.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.680
FIND HIM, YOU'LL FIND HER.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.970
[JAKE] OKAY.

03:43.010 --> 03:44.850
DO YOU WANT ANY PHYSICAL
EVIDENCE?

03:44.890 --> 03:47.020
YOU KNOW, VIDEOTAPES,
PHOTOGRAPHS?

03:47.060 --> 03:47.890
THAT KIND OF THING.

03:47.930 --> 03:50.060
[DARYL] JUST... BRING HER HOME.

03:50.100 --> 03:52.060
ALONE.

03:52.100 --> 03:54.900
[DARYL] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
I'M SURE YOU FIND THOSE REPORTS

03:54.940 --> 03:56.690
AS EXCITING AS I DO...

03:56.730 --> 04:00.110
&lt;♪♪&gt;

04:00.150 --> 04:02.160
&lt;JAKE KNOCKS ON THE DOOR&gt;

04:03.490 --> 04:05.370
[MAGGIE] WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE
SELLING, WE'RE NOT INTERESTED.

04:05.410 --> 04:07.040
[JAKE] OH NO! ACTUALLY,
I'M HERE--

04:07.080 --> 04:08.910
I'M LOOKING FOR BRUCE BORDEN.

04:08.950 --> 04:10.290
IS HE YOUR HUSBAND?

04:10.330 --> 04:12.120
[MAGGIE] WHO ARE YOU?
[JAKE] A BUSINESS ASSOCIATE.

04:12.170 --> 04:14.040
HE ASKED ME TO COME BY.

04:14.080 --> 04:15.670
YOU HIS WIFE?

04:15.710 --> 04:18.130
[MAGGIE] SOMETIMES.
[JAKE] ANY IDEA
WHEN HE'LL BE HOME?

04:18.170 --> 04:19.550
[MAGGIE] NO IDEA.

04:21.340 --> 04:22.300
[JAKE] ANY IDEA WHERE I COULD
FIND HIM?

04:22.340 --> 04:24.340
[MAGGIE] WELL HE'S ALWAYS
AT WORK.

04:27.470 --> 04:30.480
YOU'RE THE BUSINESS ASSOCIATE,
WHY DON'T YOU FIGURE IT OUT?

04:37.150 --> 04:38.940
[GARRISON] SHE LOOKED CUTE.

04:41.650 --> 04:45.530
YOUR TECHNIQUE WAS UNREFINED.

04:45.570 --> 04:50.700
TOO CRASS. IF ONE IS NOT BORN
WITH GRACE, IT CAN BE LEARNED.

04:50.750 --> 04:52.580
[JAKE] THANKS FOR THE ADVICE.

04:52.620 --> 04:56.290
[GARRISON] MUCH AS IT WAS
WITH... NIKKI.

04:56.330 --> 04:57.750
YOU REALLY SCREWED THAT
MARRIAGE, DIDN'T YOU?

04:57.790 --> 04:59.750
[JAKE] YOU WATCH YOURSELF.
[GARRISON] IT'S VERY CLEAR...

04:59.800 --> 05:01.630
YOUR PROBLEM WITH WOMEN.

05:01.670 --> 05:06.010
WHEN I STUDY A SUBJECT FOR A
NOVEL I LIKE TO FIND THE TRUE

05:06.050 --> 05:08.350
INSPIRATION BEHIND THEHE TRUE
CHARACTERS I WRITE ABOUT.

05:08.390 --> 05:09.720
[JAKE] YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT ME.

05:09.760 --> 05:12.890
[GARRISON] INFIDELITY.
[JAKE] I WAS NEVER UNFAITHFUL.

05:12.930 --> 05:15.940
[GARRISON] NOT ALL INFIDELITY
IS PHYSICAL. SHE COULD NEVER

05:15.980 --> 05:20.190
TRUST YOU COMPLETELY BECAUSE
YOU WERE INCAPABLE OF...

05:20.230 --> 05:21.360
[JAKE] OF WHAT?!

05:21.400 --> 05:24.490
[GARRISON] OF TRULY GIVING
YOURSELF TO HER.

05:24.530 --> 05:26.070
FULLY.

05:26.110 --> 05:30.660
YOU ARE FAR TOO IMMATURE FOR
SERIOUS COMMITMENT.

05:30.700 --> 05:32.120
[JAKE] HACK!

05:32.160 --> 05:33.750
[GARRISON] FOUR OF MY BOOKS

05:33.790 --> 05:35.370
COPIES IN 14 LANGUAGES.

05:35.410 --> 05:37.210
THERE HAVE BEEN MOVIES,
SEQUELS--

05:37.250 --> 05:39.880
[JAKE] HEY, IF PEOPLE GET PAST
HOW UNREALISTIC YOUR DIALOG,

05:39.920 --> 05:42.380
CHARACTERS, ACTION, AND STORY
ARE, WELL, GOOD FOR THEM.

05:42.420 --> 05:44.170
[GARRISON] SO YOU'VE READ ME?

05:44.220 --> 05:46.510
[JAKE] YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT MY LIFE. I DON'T WANT

05:46.550 --> 05:50.050
YOU COPYING IT FOR SOME STUPID
DIME STORE PAPER BACK NOVEL.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.140
[GARRISON] I DON'T COPY LIFE,
I IMPROVE ON IT!

05:52.180 --> 05:55.940
[JAKE] WELL IF I WANT SOME
SELF-IMPROVEMENT SOME TIME,
I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL.

05:55.980 --> 05:59.560
[GARRISON] A BATHROOM IN HERE
WOULD BE A GREAT IMPROVEMENT.

05:59.610 --> 06:00.940
I HAVE TO PEE.

06:00.980 --> 06:03.990
&lt;♪♪&gt;

06:08.700 --> 06:09.820
[JAKE] THAT'S ACTUALLY...

06:09.870 --> 06:10.660
THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA.

06:10.700 --> 06:19.540
IT MIGHT ACTUALLY WORK.

06:19.580 --> 06:29.180
OH YOU--
CAN THIS GET ANY WORSE?

06:29.220 --> 06:33.850
I THINK IT JUST DID.
[JAKE] BRUCE!

06:33.890 --> 06:35.180
BRUCE BORDEN?

06:35.220 --> 06:37.770
[BRUCE] HEY, DO I KNOW YOU?
I NEVER FORGET A FACE.

06:37.810 --> 06:39.600

OF QUESTIONS?

06:39.650 --> 06:41.190

DIVORCE ACTUALLY.

06:46.610 --> 06:47.740
[BRUCE] CONGRATULATIONS.

06:47.780 --> 06:51.450
THIS IS THE PERFECT TIME FOR YOU
TO THINK ABOUT LIFE INSURANCE.

06:51.490 --> 06:53.370
[JAKE] I'M LOOKING FOR
GRACE EBNER.

06:53.410 --> 06:54.620
[BRUCE] GRACE.

06:54.660 --> 06:56.040
GORGEOUS.

06:56.080 --> 06:59.290
I JUST SOLD HER HUSBAND A
20 MILLION DOLLAR PACKAGE.

06:59.330 --> 07:00.750
[JAKE] RIGHT. DO YOU KNOW
WHERE I CAN FIND HER?

07:00.790 --> 07:01.880
[BRUCE] SHE'S IN BED.

07:01.920 --> 07:02.880
TUCKERED OUT I SHOULD SAY.

07:02.920 --> 07:05.840
I'M SCREWING HER.

07:05.880 --> 07:06.920
LIFE IS SWEET!

07:06.960 --> 07:07.880
[JAKE] RIGHT.

MOVIE MADE FROM YOUR BOOKS.

07:24.190 --> 07:26.530
"TO KILL A MURDERER"
WAS KILLER!

07:26.570 --> 07:28.070
[GARRISON] THANK YOU.

07:28.110 --> 07:29.610
[BRUCE] WELL
COME ON BACK INSIDE.
I THINK WE SHOULD TALK.

07:29.650 --> 07:33.700
I HAVE A LIFE INSURANCE PLAN
THAT I THINK YOU WOULD
DROOL OVER.

07:33.740 --> 07:36.910
[JAKE] NO, I THINK HE'S DONE
ENOUGH DROOLING ALREADY.

07:36.950 --> 07:38.620

07:50.930 --> 07:52.260
[GARRISON] I WAS PUMPING
MAGGIE FOR INFORMATION,

07:52.300 --> 07:54.470
SHE'S NOT HAPPY
IN THAT MARRIAGE.

07:54.510 --> 07:55.640
[JAKE] THE FACT THAT HER
HUSBAND IS SLEEPING

07:55.680 --> 07:57.470
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN
DIDN'T GIVE YOU THAT?

07:57.520 --> 07:59.520
[GARRISON] THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ALL WIVES UNHAPPY.

08:02.100 --> 08:04.520
[JAKE] HELLO.

10:08.270 --> 10:09.650

10:17.610 --> 10:18.950
THE CASE IS CLOSED.

10:18.990 --> 10:21.660
[GARRISON] WELL SURELY THERE
MUST BE ANOTHER CASE?

10:21.700 --> 10:22.740

[GARRISON] PLEASURE IS ALL
MINE, SERGEANT.

11:04.410 --> 11:05.700
[LESLIE] THANK YOU.

11:05.740 --> 11:08.370
I FOUND YOUR BUSINESS CARD IN
THE MAN'S POCKET.

11:08.410 --> 11:11.790
THE MAN'S VEHICLE IS PARKED UP
AHEAD... ON HIS CHEST.

11:16.550 --> 11:19.050
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT
BRUCE BORDEN?

11:19.090 --> 11:20.470
[JAKE] NOT MUCH.

11:20.510 --> 11:21.590
THAT'S HIM.

11:21.640 --> 11:24.140
[LESLIE] WAS.
[JAKE] DON'T WORRY.

11:24.180 --> 11:26.850
I'M PRETTY SURE HE HAD
LIFE INSURANCE.

11:26.890 --> 11:29.230
[GARRISON] "WITH LOVE,
GARRISON STEELE"

11:29.270 --> 11:30.770
THERE YOU GO!
[WOMAN OFFICER] THANK YOU!

11:30.810 --> 11:32.060
[GARRISON] AND A PICTURE...

11:32.100 --> 11:33.810
[LESLIE] DO YOU WANNA TELL ME
WHY THIS KEEPS HAPPENING?

11:33.860 --> 11:35.230
[JAKE] I MET BRUCE...

11:35.270 --> 11:36.400
WHAT, YESTERDAY?

11:36.440 --> 11:37.860
I TALKED TO HIM FOR LIKE
3 MINUTES.

11:37.900 --> 11:39.990
[LESLIE] ABOUT WHAT?
[JAKE] DARYL EBNER'S WIFE,

11:40.030 --> 11:40.990
SHE WENT MISSING.

11:41.030 --> 11:42.030
HE HIRED US TO FIND HER.

11:42.070 --> 11:43.490
HER NAME WAS GRACE, OKAY?

11:43.530 --> 11:47.910
APPARENTLY SHE WAS ON
SOME BENDER WITH BRUCE AND
ANOTHER GUY.

11:47.950 --> 11:51.580
[LESLIE] WHO?
[JAKE] I DIDN'T GET HIS NAME.

11:51.620 --> 11:53.420
[LESLIE] WAS BRUCE SLEEPING
WITH EBNER'S WIFE?

11:53.460 --> 11:55.500
[JAKE] THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD ME.

11:55.540 --> 11:56.500
[LESLIE] OKAY.

11:56.550 --> 11:57.090
I'LL BE IN TOUCH.

11:57.130 --> 11:58.130
[JAKE] WHOA, WHOA, C'MON!

11:58.170 --> 12:00.050
GIVE ME A BREAK.
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

12:00.090 --> 12:02.300
[LESLIE] THERE'S NO WITNESSES
DOYLE. IT LOOKS LIKE HE WAS
FIXING HIS CAR,

12:02.340 --> 12:04.720
HE LEFT THE CAR IN DRIVE,
HE LIFTED THE HOOD AND
IT RAN HIM OVER.

12:04.760 --> 12:06.810
[JAKE] AND THE POLICE
MECHANIC SAYS...?

12:06.850 --> 12:08.770
[LESLIE] CAR WAS FINE.
[JAKE] CAR WAS FINE? RIGHT.

12:08.810 --> 12:12.940
SO HE FIXED THE CAR,
THEN HE RAN HIMSELF OVER?

12:12.980 --> 12:13.810
REALLY?

12:13.850 --> 12:16.480
[LESLIE] THE WIFE IS ALIBIED.

12:16.520 --> 12:18.440
SHE WAS GETTING A HAIRCUT.

12:18.480 --> 12:20.490
[JAKE] THANK YOU.
WAS THAT SO HARD?

12:20.530 --> 12:22.740
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL BY THE WAY.

12:22.780 --> 12:26.120
THIS HAIR STYLE REALLY
SUITS YOU.

12:26.160 --> 12:28.950
[LESLIE] DOYLE, YOU'RE AT THE
SITE OF A HOMICIDE.

12:28.990 --> 12:30.540
STOP HITTING ON ME.

12:30.580 --> 12:32.750
[JAKE] I WASN'T HITTING ON YOU,
IT WAS A COMPLIMENT.

12:32.790 --> 12:34.000
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT.

12:34.040 --> 12:36.250
FOR THE LAST TIME,
I DON'T DATE COPS SERGEANT,

12:36.290 --> 12:37.920
SO BACK OFF!

12:37.960 --> 12:40.800
[GARRISON] DEFLECTION THROUGH
HUMOUR. TYPICAL FOR A MAN WHO

12:40.840 --> 12:43.470
REFUSES TO DEAL WITH HIS OWN
ISSUES.

12:43.510 --> 12:44.390
[JAKE] ALRIGHT, PALLY.

12:44.430 --> 12:45.970
THIS IS WHERE YOU GET OFF.

12:46.010 --> 12:47.850
NO MORE OF YOUR DR. PHIL
ROUTINE. WE'RE DONE.

12:47.890 --> 12:49.970
[GARRISON] BUT THE CASE IS
FINALLY GETTING JUICY.

12:50.020 --> 12:52.180
[JAKE] LOOK, WE FOUND EBNER'S
WIFE AND SHE'S BACK IN HER

12:52.230 --> 12:55.020
HATEFUL MARRIAGE SAFE AND
SOUND. CASE CLOSED.

12:55.060 --> 12:57.520
[GARRISON] THIS MURDER IS THE
FIRST INTERESTING THING THAT

12:57.570 --> 12:58.860
HAPPENED SINCE I MET YOU.

12:58.900 --> 12:59.940
WE CAN'T STOP NOW.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.780
[JAKE] OKAY,
IT WASN'T A MURDER.

13:01.820 --> 13:03.820
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT... MAYBE.

13:03.860 --> 13:06.620
AND EITHER WAY,
IT'S NONE OF OUR BUSINESS.

13:06.660 --> 13:09.580
[GARRISON] I'LL PAY YOU
10 GRAND TO STAY ON IT.

13:09.620 --> 13:11.000
[JAKE] NO.

13:11.040 --> 13:15.790
[GARRISON] 15 THOUSAND
TO CONTINUE ON THIS CASE
TILL THE END.

13:17.840 --> 13:20.000
CASH.

13:20.050 --> 13:21.800
[JAKE] ALRIGHT, FINE.

13:21.840 --> 13:25.260
[GARRISON] &lt;LAUGHS&gt;
WHAT A SAP.

13:25.300 --> 13:28.300
I WOULD HAVE GONE TO 20.
YOU'RE TOO EASY.

13:31.270 --> 13:33.640
&lt;♪♪&gt;

13:33.680 --> 13:34.980
[MAGGIE] ALL I KNOW
IS WHAT THEY TOLD ME,

13:35.020 --> 13:38.810
THAT HE WAS FIXING HIS CAR
WHEN IT RAN HIM OVER.

13:38.860 --> 13:40.570
[JAKE] HE RAN HIMSELF OVER?

13:40.610 --> 13:42.900
C'MON MAGGIE, THIS WASN'T AN
ACCIDENT.

13:42.940 --> 13:44.070
[MAGGIE] YOU REALLY THINK SO?

13:44.110 --> 13:46.200
[GARRISON] WHO WOULD HAVE HAD
IT IN FOR BRUCE?

13:46.240 --> 13:48.410
WHO WOULD WANT TO HURT HIM?

13:48.450 --> 13:50.660
THINK MAGGIE, THINK.

13:50.700 --> 13:52.080
[MAGGIE] WHAT ARE YOU IMPLYING?

13:52.120 --> 13:53.540
[GARRISON] I'M IMPLYING
NOTHING. JUST ASKING THE TOUGH

13:53.580 --> 13:58.630
QUESTIONS. SOMEONE HAS TO.
[MAGGIE] I...

13:58.670 --> 14:02.050
I GUESS...

14:02.090 --> 14:03.210
[GARRISON] KIDNAPPING?

14:03.260 --> 14:04.670
BLACKMAIL? MONEY LAUNDERING?

14:04.720 --> 14:06.720
INSURANCE FRAUD?
[JAKE] IGNORE HIM.

14:06.760 --> 14:08.760
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO FIND
OUT IF SOMEONE MIGHT HAVE
HAD A GRUDGE.

14:08.800 --> 14:11.060
[MAGGIE] THERE IS SOMETHING.
[GARRISON] GO ON MAGGIE,

14:11.100 --> 14:13.020
IT'S OKAY.

14:13.060 --> 14:16.190
[MAGGIE] BLACKMAIL.
[JAKE] BLACKMAIL?

14:16.230 --> 14:18.650
[GARRISON] I THOUGHT SO.
[MAGGIE] I DON'T KNOW WHO,

14:18.690 --> 14:21.110
OR WHY. I JUST KNOW THAT BRUCE
WAS CONVINCED THAT HIS LIFE

14:21.150 --> 14:23.150
WAS IN DANGER.
[JAKE] SOMEONE WAS BLACKMAILING

14:23.190 --> 14:23.900
HIM? YOU'RE SURE?

14:23.940 --> 14:26.070
[MAGGIE] YES!

14:26.110 --> 14:27.950
I'M SORRY.

14:27.990 --> 14:29.490
HE FOUND OUT SOMETHING.

14:29.530 --> 14:31.410
I THINK BRUCE WAS TRYING TO
BLACKMAIL SOMEONE ELSE.

14:31.450 --> 14:32.830
[GARRISON] REALLY?
[JAKE] SHUT UP!

14:32.870 --> 14:35.250
[GARRISON] MR. DOYLE AND
I HAVE A THEORY.
[JAKE] NO WE DON'T!

14:35.290 --> 14:37.920
[GARRISON] WAS HE BLACKMAILING
HIS LOVER GRACE?

14:37.960 --> 14:43.500
DID HE HAVE TAPES OF THEM?
[MAGGIE] MAYBE.

14:43.550 --> 14:46.260
[GARRISON] WHEN WE WENT TO THE
HOTEL ROOM THERE WAS A VERY

14:46.300 --> 14:47.800
SHADOWY-LOOKING CHARACTER
LURKING ABOUT.

14:47.840 --> 14:49.010
[JAKE] OKAY, NONE OF THIS--
[GARRISON] HE WAS THREATENING

14:49.050 --> 14:52.180
TO PUT VIDEO OF EBNER'S WIFE
ON PORNO SITES, WASN'T HE?

14:52.220 --> 14:53.760
[JAKE] OKAY! WE ARE DONE!

14:53.810 --> 14:55.140
I AM SO SORRY.
GET UP.

14:55.180 --> 14:56.350
[GARRISON] EXCUSE--
[JAKE] NO! WE ARE LEAVING

14:56.390 --> 14:57.980

15:09.030 --> 15:10.070
[JAKE] CHARM?

15:10.110 --> 15:11.910
OLD HOUSES HAVE A CERTAIN
CHARM.

15:11.950 --> 15:13.740
OLD PUBS THAT SMELL LIKE URINE,
THEY HAVE A CERTAIN CHARM.

15:13.780 --> 15:15.040
[ROSE] JAKE, PLEASE!

15:15.080 --> 15:16.790
[JAKE] ON THAT TOPIC,

15:16.830 --> 15:19.000
[ROSE] HE SWORE ME TO SECRECY.

15:19.040 --> 15:21.960

[ROSE] WE HAVE A DINNER GUEST,

15:28.340 --> 15:30.090

15:41.440 --> 15:44.520
DO YOU REMEMBER THE LAST
AFRICAN CHILD SHE ADOPTED?

15:44.570 --> 15:46.650

15:53.070 --> 15:54.030
[DES] OH THAT'S TOO BAD.

15:54.070 --> 15:56.040
I THOUGHT HE WOULD BE PERFECT
FOR THE LEAD IN,

15:56.080 --> 15:57.370

16:16.140 --> 16:18.180
[GARRISON] WE JUST NEED TO
TALK TO EBNER'S WIFE.

16:18.220 --> 16:20.060
[JAKE] WE CAN'T TALK TO
EBNER'S WIFE.

16:20.100 --> 16:22.140
[GARRISON] SAYS WHO?
[JAKE] EBNER, AND THE DETOX

16:22.190 --> 16:24.520

[GARRISON] JAKE, REALLY HOW

16:24.560 --> 16:27.440
HAVE YOU GOTTEN THIS FAR IN
LIFE BY ALWAYS TAKING "NO"

16:27.480 --> 16:28.860
FOR AN ANSWER?

16:28.900 --> 16:30.150
[JAKE] STEELE...

16:30.190 --> 16:31.690
WE'RE DONE.

16:31.740 --> 16:33.860
[GARRISON] REALLY, LIKE YOUR
MARRIAGE? LIKE YOUR RELATIONS

16:33.910 --> 16:36.450
WITH THIS BEAUTIFUL POLICE
OFFICER, WHAT'S HER NAME?

16:36.490 --> 16:37.120
[TINNY] LESLIE.

16:37.160 --> 16:38.990
UNCLE JAKE BLEW IT WITH HER.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.040
[DES] BUT THE MARRIAGE IS NOT
ENTIRELY HIS FAULT.

16:41.080 --> 16:42.120
SHE IS A BIT BATTY.

16:42.160 --> 16:45.540
[JAKE] DES JUST--
THANK YOU.

16:45.580 --> 16:47.000
[GARRISON] IT'S TRUE JAKE.

16:47.040 --> 16:51.470
THE LIFE AND THE LOVE IT SEEMS
DON'T REALLY MIX FOR YOU,

16:51.510 --> 16:52.260
DO THEY?

16:52.300 --> 16:53.760
[JAKE] CAN I PLEASE BE EXCUSED?

16:53.800 --> 16:57.260
[GARRISON] THE FEAR OF
INTIMACY, THE LEATHER JACKET,

16:57.300 --> 16:58.510
THE CAR.

16:58.560 --> 16:59.140

17:08.690 --> 17:11.530
IN CASH AND I WANT YOU TO GET
OUT OF MY HOUSE.

17:11.570 --> 17:12.820
[GARRISON] THAT'S ANOTHER THING.

17:12.860 --> 17:14.860
YOU STILL LIVE IN YOUR
FATHER'S HOUSE.

17:14.910 --> 17:16.240
YOU'RE A GROWN MAN!

17:16.280 --> 17:18.280
[TINNY] THAT'S WHAT

17:18.330 --> 17:19.240
[JAKE] LEAVE!

17:19.280 --> 17:20.740
PLEASE!

17:20.790 --> 17:22.750
[GARRISON] DOUBLE OR NOTHING.

17:22.790 --> 17:27.170
I BET YOU 15 THOUSAND THAT I CAN
GET EBNER'S WIFE TO TALK TO ME.

17:27.210 --> 17:30.210
TONIGHT.

17:30.250 --> 17:36.090
[DES] DO IT JAKE.
[JAKE] ALRIGHT.

17:36.130 --> 17:36.840
BUT NOT FOR MONEY.

17:36.890 --> 17:39.390
IF I WIN, YOU LEAVE TOWN
TONIGHT.

17:39.430 --> 17:41.600
NO MORE OF THIS ARM CHAIR
PSYCHOANALYSIS.

17:41.640 --> 17:44.640
NO MORE CRAP OUT OF YOUR MOUTH.
YOU'RE GONE.

17:45.890 --> 17:47.270
[GARRISON] DEAL.

17:47.310 --> 17:53.320
BUT IF I WIN,
NO MORE COMPLAINING ABOUT ME
SHADOWING YOU.

17:53.360 --> 17:55.860
[JAKE] FINE.

17:55.900 --> 17:57.910
&lt;DOOR BELL RINGS&gt;

18:01.370 --> 18:04.120
[JAKE] THAT'S EBNER'S WIFE,
ISN'T IT?

18:06.290 --> 18:07.920
[ROSE] OH MY!

18:14.840 --> 18:17.300
[JAKE] WHO WAS THE MAN WE SAW
LEAVING YOUR ROOM?

18:17.340 --> 18:19.050
[GRACE] THAT'S MY SWEET NEVIL.

18:19.090 --> 18:22.100
[GARRISON] HERE YOU ARE.
[GRACE] THANK YOU.

18:24.600 --> 18:27.270
[GRACE] YOU KNOW, WE MET THE
SAME NIGHT I MET BRUCEY.

18:27.310 --> 18:28.900
THE THREE OF US HIT IT OFF.

18:28.940 --> 18:32.480
[JAKE] THE "THREE" OF YOU?
[GRACE] SOCIALLY.

18:32.520 --> 18:34.570
[GARRISON] BUT YOU WERE SEEING
BOTH OF THEM?

18:34.610 --> 18:37.490
[JAKE] PLUS YOU'RE MARRIED.
THAT DIDN'T CAUSE YOU ANY
PROBLEMS, DID IT?

18:37.530 --> 18:39.990
[GRACE] DARYL DOESN'T REALLY
CARE WHAT I DO ANYMORE.

18:40.030 --> 18:44.240
EVENTUALLY NEVIL ASKED
ME TO BREAK IT OFF WITH
BRUCE AND TO LEAVE DARYL.

18:44.290 --> 18:48.170
NEVIL IS VERY SWEET AND JEALOUS.

18:48.210 --> 18:49.580
HE LOVES ME.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.380
[GARRISON] MOTIVE.

18:56.970 --> 18:59.890
&lt;KNOCKING ON THE DOOR&gt;
[JAKE] NEVIL?

18:59.930 --> 19:01.600
NEVIL "WABABA"?

19:01.640 --> 19:02.300
[GARRISON] "WADBAH".

19:02.350 --> 19:04.140
[JAKE] WAD-- WOBDA.

19:04.180 --> 19:06.520
JUST NEED TO ASK YOU
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS

19:06.560 --> 19:08.390
ABOUT BRUCE BORDEN.

19:08.440 --> 19:09.390
HE WAS MURDERED YESTERDAY.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.440
[NEVIL] SHHH!

19:15.440 --> 19:16.530
MY BOSS COULD HEAR YOU.

19:16.570 --> 19:19.320
THIS ISN'T RIGHT. RUNNING INTO
MY OFFICE, MAKING ACCUSATIONS.

19:19.360 --> 19:20.950
[JAKE] NEVIL--
[NEVIL] HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT,

19:20.990 --> 19:23.330
IF I RAN INTO YOUR PLACE
OF WORK AND STARTED
YELLING ABOUT A DEAD GUY?

19:23.370 --> 19:25.370
[JAKE] WOULD YOU JUST RELAX,
CALM DOWN!

19:25.410 --> 19:26.750
WE JUST NEED TO ASK YOU A
COUPLE OF QUESTIONS.

19:26.790 --> 19:28.370
[NEVIL] NO I WON'T CALM DOWN!
THIS ISN'T RIGHT.

19:28.410 --> 19:30.370
[GARRISON] NEVIL, WE JUST SPOKE
WITH GRACE.

19:30.420 --> 19:31.830
[NEVIL] GRACE?

19:31.880 --> 19:33.000
IS SHE OKAY?

19:33.040 --> 19:35.380
[GARRISON] I THINK SHE'S TRYING
TO DRY OUT.

19:35.420 --> 19:36.420
[NEVIL] WELL THAT'S GOOD.

19:36.460 --> 19:38.550
THAT'S-- SHE'S SWEET.
THAT'S GOOD.

19:38.590 --> 19:40.840
[JAKE] GRACE TOLD US THAT YOU
HAD A LITTLE BIT OF JEALOUSY,

19:40.880 --> 19:42.970
THAT YOU WEREN'T TOO KEEN ON
THE FACT THAT BOTH YOU AND

19:43.010 --> 19:44.810
BRUCE BORDEN--
[GARRISON] WERE BOTH BANGING

19:44.850 --> 19:46.770
THE SAME WOMAN,
AT THE SAME TIME.

19:46.810 --> 19:49.390
[JAKE] "DATING" THE SAME WOMAN,
AT THE SAME TIME.

19:49.430 --> 19:50.560
[NEVIL] WELL WHO WOULD BE?

19:50.600 --> 19:52.270
WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME ALL THIS?

19:52.310 --> 19:53.110
[GARRISON] BLACKMAIL.

19:53.150 --> 19:54.190
[NEVIL] BLACKMAIL?!

19:54.230 --> 19:56.190
WE WERE SPEAKING
TO BRUCE'S WIFE, MAGGIE.

19:56.230 --> 19:58.570
SHE SAID BRUCE HAD
SOME INFO ON THIS BIG DEAL.

19:58.610 --> 20:00.200
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT?

20:00.240 --> 20:03.030
[NEVIL] I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

20:03.070 --> 20:06.290
[JAKE] REALLY?
[NEVIL] NO.

20:06.330 --> 20:07.830
[JAKE] WHAT IS IT
THAT YOU DO HERE, EXACTLY?

20:07.870 --> 20:08.790
[NEVIL] I'M A GEOLOGIST.

20:08.830 --> 20:10.830
SEISMIC DATA ACQUISITIONS.

20:13.330 --> 20:15.420
[JAKE] WELL IF YOU
HAPPEN TO KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT BRUCE'S MURDER--

20:15.460 --> 20:17.130
[NEVIL] I HAVE A MEETING.

20:17.170 --> 20:18.840
[JAKE] OKAY, WELL IF YOU
REMEMBER ANYTHING,

20:18.880 --> 20:19.720
THERE'S MY CARD.
[NEVIL] GREAT!

20:19.760 --> 20:21.300
SHUT THE DOOR WHEN YOU LEAVE.

20:21.340 --> 20:23.720
[JAKE] CALL ME IF YOU--
[NEVIL] YUP!

20:27.560 --> 20:29.180
[JAKE] WAIT A MINUTE.

20:30.770 --> 20:32.020
LOOK AT THAT.

20:32.060 --> 20:34.810
DARYL EBNER,
HE WAS WORKING ON SOME OIL DEAL.

20:34.860 --> 20:36.730
HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH
SPUDGEL'S COVE TOO.

20:36.770 --> 20:38.280
[GARRISON] WELL, THEY'RE BOTH
INTERESTED IN THE SAME WOMAN,

20:38.320 --> 20:43.160
WHY NOT THE SAME OIL PATCH?
[JAKE] NICE.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.700
[JAKE] WALTER?

20:44.740 --> 20:50.790
HEY, LISTEN I THINK IT'S TIME
THAT THE DOYLE'S GOT INTO
THE OIL BUSINESS.

20:50.830 --> 20:53.000
[DARYL] ACCORDING TO
INDEPENDENT GEOLOGISTS,

20:53.040 --> 20:56.960
THE CORE SAMPLE WE LIFTED FROM
THIS DEPTH SHOWS A POTENTIAL

20:57.000 --> 21:01.470
OF BETWEEN 1 AND 2 BILLION
BARRELS OF OIL.

21:01.510 --> 21:03.470
[WALTER] MY CLIENT IS
INTERESTED IN INVESTING A

21:03.510 --> 21:07.390
SIZABLE AMOUNT OF MONEY.
[ROSE] NOW I NOTICE THE CORE

21:07.430 --> 21:09.140
SAMPLES HAVE NOT BEEN
REGISTERED MR. EBNER.

21:09.180 --> 21:10.310
IS THERE ANY REASON FOR THIS?

21:10.350 --> 21:11.520
[DARYL] LEGAL FORMALITIES.

21:11.560 --> 21:16.100
WE'RE JUST DAYS AWAY.
[ROSE] WALTER, CALL THE

21:16.150 --> 21:18.980
BAHAMAS. SEE IF THEY CAN
MOVE THE FUNDS AS QUICKLY AS

21:19.020 --> 21:21.320
MR. EBNER MAY NEED.

21:21.360 --> 21:24.450
YOU KNOW, I INVESTED IN THE
HIBERNIA SOUTH BASIN LAST YEAR.

21:24.490 --> 21:28.700
THE OIL THERE IS SO BOUNTIFUL,
IT WILL BE PAYING FOR MY

21:28.740 --> 21:31.540
GREAT, GREAT GRAND CHILDREN'S
RETIREMENT.

21:31.580 --> 21:35.370
[WALTER] HELLO BAHAMAS BANK?
[DARYL] EVENTUALLY, YES. BUT

21:35.420 --> 21:39.380
THE BEAUTY OF SPUDGEL'S COVE
PROJECT IS THAT IT'S ONSHORE.

21:39.420 --> 21:40.880
YOU'LL BE FASTER TO THAT MONEY.

21:40.920 --> 21:42.710
[ROSE] I'VE BEEN DOWN THAT
ROAD BEFORE IN BORNEO.

21:42.760 --> 21:44.670
IT DIDN'T TURN OUT SO WELL.

21:44.720 --> 21:47.470
[DARYL] BORNEO DIDN'T HAVE
NEVIL WADBAH.

21:47.510 --> 21:50.510
THIS GUY COULD FIND
OIL IN VINEGAR.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.520
&lt;♪♪&gt;

21:53.560 --> 21:56.270
[GARRISON] YOU KNOW JAKEY BOY,
I'VE CONQUERED OLYMPIANS,

21:56.310 --> 21:57.850
I'VE BEDDED A QUEEN.

21:57.900 --> 22:00.360
[JAKE] STEELE, WHAT IS
YOUR POINT?

22:00.400 --> 22:01.900
[GARRISON] WHY ARE YOU SO
AGGRESSIVE?

22:01.940 --> 22:03.530
[JAKE] I DON'T KNOW,
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME.

22:03.570 --> 22:04.820
[GARRISON] YOUR PROBLEM WITH
INTIMACY. DON'T YOU WANT TO

22:04.860 --> 22:07.910
KNOW WHAT IS SO CLEAR TO
EVERYONE BUT YOURSELF?

22:07.950 --> 22:11.160
[JAKE] NO, I DON'T.
&lt;JAKE'S PHONE RINGS&gt;

22:11.200 --> 22:15.410
[JAKE] HEY THERE?
[LESLIE] JAKE, I'M LOOKING TO
TALK TO NEVIL WADBAH.

22:15.460 --> 22:18.170
[JAKE] NEVIL... RIGHT.
[LESLIE] ABOUT BRUCE BORDEN'S
MURDER.

22:18.210 --> 22:20.750
I TURN UP AT HIS HOUSE AND IT
LOOKS LIKE HE TOOK OFF.

22:20.790 --> 22:22.960
AND WHOSE BUSINESS CARD SHOULD
I FIND THERE?

22:23.000 --> 22:23.670
YOURS.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.590
[JAKE] YEAH...

22:25.630 --> 22:27.090
I KNOW THAT LOOKS BAD.

22:27.130 --> 22:29.090
[LESLIE] PLEASE, PLEASE JUST
STAY OUT OF THE WAY ON THIS

22:29.140 --> 22:30.180
ONE DOYLE.

22:30.220 --> 22:33.060
JUST STAY OUT OF IT.

22:33.100 --> 22:34.810
[GARRISON] I'M TELLING YOU,
IT'S THE JEALOUS BOYFRIEND.

22:34.850 --> 22:35.980
HE HAS MOTIVE, HE HAS LUST.

22:36.020 --> 22:37.350
[JAKE] HE HAS ASTHMA.

22:37.390 --> 22:39.100
I SERIOUSLY DOUBT NEVIL'S OUR
GUY, ALRIGHT.

22:39.150 --> 22:42.270
[ROSE] ACCORDING TO EBNER,
NEVIL IS ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S

22:42.320 --> 22:45.530
FOREMOST GEOLOGISTS. WHEN
HE SAYS DRILL, THEY FIND OIL.

22:45.570 --> 22:46.950
[GARRISON] SO THEY DO KNOW
EACH OTHER?

22:46.990 --> 22:50.160
[JAKE] QUESTION IS, WHAT DID
BRUCE BORDEN KNOW ABOUT THEM?

22:50.200 --> 22:53.200
&lt;♪♪&gt;

22:54.620 --> 22:56.580
[DARYL] WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

22:56.620 --> 22:59.710
[JAKE] WELL, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

22:59.750 --> 23:01.960
[GARRISON] LOSE SOMETHING
BESIDES NEVIL?

23:02.000 --> 23:04.750
[DARYL] GENTLEMEN, PLEASE
SHOW MR. DOYLE AND HIS FRIEND
THE WAY OUT OF THE BUILDING.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.550
[JAKE] OH THAT'S OKAY.
I WAS IN BOY SCOUTS,

23:06.590 --> 23:08.590
SO I CAN TOTALLY FIND
MY OWN WAY OUT. LETS GO.

23:08.630 --> 23:09.550
[GARRISON] I'M NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

23:09.590 --> 23:11.600
[JAKE] WHOA! WHOA!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

23:11.640 --> 23:12.850
WHAT?!

23:14.760 --> 23:15.640
C'MON MAN!

23:15.680 --> 23:18.440
C'MON HERE!

23:18.480 --> 23:20.480
HE'S THE ONE THAT
SLAPPED YOU! WHAT--

23:27.240 --> 23:29.780
[GARRISON] BRILLIANT
GETTING THAT BUG IN PLACE.

23:29.820 --> 23:31.490
[JAKE] SHH!
THANKS.

23:31.530 --> 23:35.080
[GARRISON] YOU MUST HAVE READ
MY SIXTH BOOK, "TO KILL A
GHOST".

23:35.120 --> 23:36.910
HEMINGWAY'S PATHOLOGIST
GAVE ME THAT.

23:36.950 --> 23:38.160
[JAKE] TOO BAD.

23:42.670 --> 23:43.630
WHERE DID YOU GET THE SANDWICH?

23:43.670 --> 23:46.340
[GARRISON] DESMOND PACKED ME
A LUNCH.

23:46.380 --> 23:47.630
[JAKE] HE DIDN'T PACK ME
A LUNCH.

23:47.670 --> 23:49.170
[GARRISON] OBVIOUSLY HE LIKES
ME BETTER THAN YOU.

23:49.220 --> 23:50.510
NOT HARD TO SEE WHY.

23:50.550 --> 23:52.470
YOU SHOULD BE NICER TO HIM,
HE LOOKS UP TO YOU.

23:52.510 --> 23:55.640
[DARYL] &lt;INTERCOM&gt; NEVIL
WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO HAD IT.

23:55.680 --> 23:58.680
WHERE IS HE GOING TO HIDE A
CYLINDER OF ROCK?

23:58.730 --> 24:00.480
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE AT
STAKE.

24:00.520 --> 24:01.690
KEEP LOOKING.

24:01.730 --> 24:03.560
[JAKE] THE CYLINDER OF ROCK?

24:03.610 --> 24:04.940
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR THE CORE
SAMPLE.

24:04.980 --> 24:07.110
[GARRISON] AS IN OIL
EXPLORATION?

24:07.150 --> 24:09.360
[JAKE] OIL AND BLACKMAIL?
[GARRISON] WAY BIGGER THAN A

24:09.400 --> 24:11.950
JEALOUS LOVER. THIS HAS GOT TO
BE WHY BRUCE WAS KILLED.

24:11.990 --> 24:13.820
[JAKE] WE DON'T ALL THE FACTS
YET, OKAY.

24:13.870 --> 24:18.700
[GARRISON] BUT THE LINK
BETWEEN BRUCE, NEVIL AND EBNER.

24:18.750 --> 24:23.120
[JAKE] GRACE.
[GRACE] THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY

24:23.170 --> 24:24.830
SENSE. MY HUSBAND WOULD NEVER
KILL ANYBODY.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.960
[JAKE] WE THINK BRUCE WAS
BLACKMAILING YOUR HUSBAND OVER

24:27.000 --> 24:29.710
A NEW OIL DEAL. SOME CORE
SAMPLE WENT MISSING AND NEVIL

24:29.760 --> 24:32.220
IS ON THE RUN. DID YOU TELL
BRUCE ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR

24:32.260 --> 24:36.100
HUSBAND'S BUSINESS?

24:36.140 --> 24:38.220
ONE OF YOUR LOVER'S IS DEAD AND
THE OTHER ONE IS MISSING.

24:38.270 --> 24:42.600
YOU MIGHT WANT TO TALK TO US.

24:42.640 --> 24:44.690
[GRACE] BRUCE ASKED A LOT OF
QUESTIONS.

24:44.730 --> 24:46.400
[JAKE] ABOUT WHO?
YOUR HUSBAND, DARYL?

24:46.440 --> 24:52.490
[GRACE] ABOUT NEVIL.
[JAKE] TELL US WHAT'S GOING ON.

24:52.530 --> 24:53.950
[GRACE] WHEN EXPLORATION
DRILLING COMES UP DRY,

24:53.990 --> 24:55.990
SOMETIMES...

24:56.030 --> 24:57.950
THEY DOCTOR THE FINDINGS.

24:57.990 --> 24:59.120
THEY GET PEOPLE TO INVEST.

24:59.160 --> 25:01.250
AND POCKET THE MONEY.

25:01.290 --> 25:03.000
[GARRISON] THEY GET AWAY
WITH THAT?

25:03.040 --> 25:05.080
[GRACE] HEY, EVEN WITH
GOOD SCIENCE, SOMETIMES
IT DOESN'T WORK OUT.

25:05.130 --> 25:06.630
[JAKE] THE CORE SAMPLE IS
A FAKE.

25:06.670 --> 25:08.710
[GARRISON] GRACE, WE NEED
TO TALK TO NEVIL.

25:08.750 --> 25:11.050
HIS LIFE IN DANGER.

25:11.090 --> 25:13.510
[GRACE] OKAY, JUST BE GENTLE
WITH HIM.

25:13.550 --> 25:15.550
SWEET NEVIL IS A LITTLE ANXIOUS.

25:16.760 --> 25:17.850
[JAKE] SURE.

25:17.890 --> 25:20.890
&lt;♪♪&gt;

25:31.150 --> 25:32.740
[JAKE] HEY THERE NEVIL.

25:32.780 --> 25:34.780
[NEVIL] THAT'S CLOSE ENOUGH.

25:35.950 --> 25:38.740
[JAKE] OKAY LOOK, YOU'RE IN
A LOT OF TROUBLE HERE BUDDY.

25:38.780 --> 25:40.910
[NEVIL] I DON'T NEED YOU
TO TELL ME THAT.
I KNOW WHEN I'M TROUBLE.

25:40.950 --> 25:42.700
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
BE THE ONE'S TO TELL ME.

25:42.750 --> 25:45.540
[GARRISON] WHAT DOES
SHE SEE IN THIS GUY?

25:45.580 --> 25:47.920
[JAKE] IS THAT THE CORE SAMPLE?
[NEVIL] MAYBE.

25:47.960 --> 25:49.920
[JAKE] YOU GOTTA BLOW THIS
THING WIDE OPEN.

25:49.960 --> 25:51.670
[NEVIL] I DON'T THINK
BLOWING THE WHISTLE ON

25:51.710 --> 25:54.670
A 50 BILLION DOLLAR SCANDAL IS
GOING TO ENSURE MY SAFETY.

25:54.720 --> 25:57.140
[GARRISON] WELL, YOU CAN COME
CLEAN AND SERVE A YEAR

25:57.180 --> 25:59.600
OR KEEP RUNNING AND
END UP IN A BOX.

25:59.640 --> 26:01.600
[NEVIL] YEAH WELL I CAN'T DO
JAIL. I'D RATHER NOT DO DEATH,

26:01.640 --> 26:02.970
SO WHAT DOES THAT LEAVE ME?

26:03.020 --> 26:05.350
[JAKE] YOU HAVE TO COME WITH US
RIGHT NOW.

26:05.390 --> 26:06.560
[NEVIL] YOU SET ME UP!

26:06.600 --> 26:08.900
[JAKE] I DIDN'T-- WE DIDN'T
SET YOU UP!

26:08.940 --> 26:10.150
HEY!

26:10.730 --> 26:17.280
LOOK IT'S PUNCHY MCGEE.

26:17.320 --> 26:18.530
[JAKE] HEY.

26:19.120 --> 26:23.580
I MEAN TECHNICALLY HE'S THE GUY
THAT SLAPPED YOU, SO...

29:58.170 --> 30:01.050

PRACTICE AND ENCOURAGEMENT

30:01.090 --> 30:03.010

30:03.050 --> 30:05.720

30:42.090 --> 30:46.630

30:56.680 --> 31:03.520
WITHOUT A KEY.

31:03.570 --> 31:06.570
[CROWD] &lt;CLAPS/CHEERS&gt;

31:33.600 --> 31:35.220
[JAKE] HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?

31:35.260 --> 31:36.270

[JAKE] WELL YOU HAD A CHOICE

31:53.410 --> 31:56.040
NOT TO HAVE YOUR PUNCHY GOON
BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF ME.

31:56.080 --> 31:57.700

32:38.700 --> 32:39.700
I'M HERE TO PROTECT YOU.

32:39.750 --> 32:41.710
[NEVIL] FROM WHO?
[DARYL] THE COPS.

32:41.750 --> 32:44.710
[NEVIL] WELL WHAT WOULD THE
COPS WANT FROM ME?

32:44.750 --> 32:46.130
[DARYL] NEVIL, YOU KILLED
BRUCE BORDEN.

32:46.170 --> 32:48.210
[NEVIL] I DIDN'T KILL HIM,
YOU DID!

32:48.250 --> 32:49.550
[DARYL] NO I DIDN'T.

32:49.590 --> 32:52.010
[NEVIL] YOU KILLED BRUCE TO STOP
HIM FROM EXPOSING THE FRAUD.

32:52.050 --> 32:53.590
[DARYL] NO.

32:53.630 --> 32:54.470

32:54.510 --> 32:56.100
[NEVIL] WASN'T HE BLACKMAILING
YOU?

32:56.140 --> 32:57.350
[DARYL] NO.
HE SOLD ME INSURANCE.

32:57.390 --> 33:00.020
I THOUGHT YOU KILLED HIM
BECAUSE YOU WERE JEALOUS OF HIM

33:00.060 --> 33:01.430
WITH GRACE.

33:01.470 --> 33:08.440
[NEVIL] ARE YOU KIDDING?
[DARYL] SO THIS WAS ALL...

33:08.480 --> 33:09.690
[JAKE] WELL BOYS...

33:09.730 --> 33:11.530
WE SHOULD PROBABLY GO ON.

33:11.570 --> 33:13.740
BUT IT WAS REALLY NICE MEETING
YOU ALL, AND I THINK YOU'LL GET

33:13.780 --> 33:15.700
IT ALL SORTED OUT.
BYE.

33:15.740 --> 33:18.160
[GARRISON] TAKE CARE.
[DARYL] WAIT.

33:18.200 --> 33:21.250
NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT THE FAKE
SAMPLE EXCEPT YOU TWO GUYS

33:21.290 --> 33:22.250
AND US.

33:22.290 --> 33:23.080
[JAKE] YEAH, BUT I MEAN...

33:23.120 --> 33:25.630
IT'S NONE OF OUR BUSINESS,
RIGHT?

33:25.670 --> 33:28.000
WHO ARE WE?

33:28.040 --> 33:31.050
HE'S JUST A HACK... WRITER.

33:31.090 --> 33:32.090
YOU GUYS ARE ENEMIES?

33:32.130 --> 33:32.840
TERRIBLE.

33:32.880 --> 33:34.930
I'M LIKE LITERARILY NOBODY.

33:34.970 --> 33:37.720
&lt;♪♪&gt;

33:37.760 --> 33:39.680
[JAKE] C'MON! DO REMEMBER THE
END OF "TO KILL A MURDERER"--

33:39.720 --> 33:43.060
[GARRISON] YOU FINISHED IT?
[JAKE] NO I SKIPPED TO THE END.

33:43.100 --> 33:44.350
[DARYL] FOLLOW THEM!

33:44.640 --> 33:47.650
&lt;♪♪&gt;

34:01.450 --> 34:03.660
[LESLIE] WHAT ARE WE DOING
OUT HERE JAKE?

34:03.700 --> 34:05.210
WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?

34:05.250 --> 34:09.170
[JAKE] THIS...

34:09.210 --> 34:10.420
[LESLIE] DRILLING CORE SAMPLE?

34:10.460 --> 34:12.050
[JAKE] YEAH. ACTUALLY,

34:12.090 --> 34:14.420
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
FROM SPUDGEL'S COVE.

34:14.470 --> 34:15.840
BUT IT'S NOT.

34:15.880 --> 34:18.090
DARYL EBNER IS GOING TO USE IT
TO CONVINCE A BUNCH OF

34:18.140 --> 34:20.260
INVESTORS THAT HE'S FOUND SOME
HUGE OIL FIND, AND THEN HE'S

34:20.300 --> 34:23.180
GONNA RIP THEM ALL OFF OF THEIR
MONEY.

34:23.220 --> 34:25.390
[LESLIE] WELL THERE IS NO
FRAUD. UNLESS THE CORE IS

34:25.430 --> 34:29.270
REGISTERED. BECAUSE YOU HAVE
IT, IT MEANS IT WON'T HAPPEN.

34:29.310 --> 34:30.900
[JAKE] THERE IS NOTHING THAT
WE CAN DO?

34:30.940 --> 34:33.900
[LESLIE] YOU PREVENTED A CRIME
JAKE. NOW THAT YOU HAVE THE

34:33.940 --> 34:37.530
FAKE CORE, IT'LL ALL GO AWAY
TILL THEY SET UP THE SKEAM

34:37.570 --> 34:42.120
SOMEWHERE ELSE.
[JAKE] THAT'S IT?

34:42.160 --> 34:44.700
[LESLIE] IF YOU'RE ASKING THEN
WHO MURDERED BRUCE BORDEN,

34:44.750 --> 34:47.870
ALL I CAN SAY IS WE GOT OUR
LEADS, OKAY?

34:47.920 --> 34:48.880
[JAKE] WHOA.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.710
JUST WAIT A SECOND.

34:50.750 --> 34:55.170
[LESLIE] I'M LATE, JAKE.
[JAKE] YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE LATE.

34:55.210 --> 34:58.130
IT'S OKAY. IT'S PROBABLY NOT
A GOOD TIME ANYWAY.

34:58.180 --> 35:00.550
[LESLIE] GOOD TIME FOR WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

35:02.350 --> 35:06.100
[JAKE] YOUR SONG WAS BEAUTIFUL.

35:06.140 --> 35:08.140
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

35:12.730 --> 35:13.900
[LESLIE] WHAT?

35:13.940 --> 35:18.240
[JAKE] I WAS JUST THINKING
ABOUT US, YOU KNOW?

35:18.280 --> 35:22.330
WE NEVER REALLY RESOLVED
ANYTHING AND

35:22.370 --> 35:24.450
I DON'T KNOW LESLIE.

35:24.490 --> 35:29.250
MAYBE WE COULD GIVE IT
ANOTHER SHOT, YOU KNOW?

35:29.290 --> 35:31.290
MAYBE?

35:31.330 --> 35:34.670
[LESLIE] I...

35:34.710 --> 35:36.170
I REALLY HAVE TO GO.

35:36.210 --> 35:38.010
[JAKE] OKAY WAIT.

35:38.050 --> 35:40.510
CAN WE MEET UP LATER?

35:40.550 --> 35:45.810
I'D REALLY LIKE TO TALK TO YOU.

35:45.850 --> 35:51.690
[LESLIE] JAKE...

35:51.730 --> 35:54.820
WE'VE DONE THIS.

35:54.860 --> 35:59.740
WE'VE BEEN HERE.

35:59.780 --> 36:01.320
I CAN'T.

36:01.360 --> 36:04.080
I'M SORRY.

36:04.120 --> 36:06.120
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

36:15.750 --> 36:16.960
[JAKE] SO DAD, YOU KNOW,

36:17.000 --> 36:19.720
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET ON
MY NERVES. IT'S WORKING.

36:19.760 --> 36:22.390
SO JUST CALL ME BACK,

36:22.430 --> 36:24.100
AND TELL ME WHERE
THE HELL YOU ARE!

36:24.140 --> 36:25.350
BYE.

36:27.810 --> 36:29.390
[GARRISON] HERE WE ARE.

36:29.430 --> 36:30.430
TWO TITANS.

36:30.480 --> 36:31.980
[JAKE] YOU KNOW WHAT STEELE,

36:32.020 --> 36:34.400
THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN SAY
THAT WILL MY DAY ANY WORSE.

36:34.440 --> 36:36.190
FILL YOUR BOOTS.

36:36.230 --> 36:37.780
[GARRISON] YOU KNOW WHY I GET
SO MANY WOMEN?

36:37.820 --> 36:39.320
[JAKE] LEMON GIN?

36:39.360 --> 36:40.950
[GARRISON] HA HA HA.

36:40.990 --> 36:44.410
IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY LIKE ME,
IT'S BECAUSE THEY KNOW

36:44.450 --> 36:47.910
I ACTUALLY LIKE THEM.

36:47.950 --> 36:49.290
YOUR MOM DIED WHEN YOU
WERE 12.

36:49.330 --> 36:51.660
SO YOU IDEALIZE WOMEN.

36:51.710 --> 36:53.580
THEY'RE STRANGERS,
SO YOU HAVE A COMPULSION

36:53.620 --> 36:56.590
TO GET CLOSE TO EVERY SINGLE
WOMAN YOU MEET.

36:56.630 --> 37:00.670
YOU'RE GETTING AS CLOSE
AS SKIN, JAKE, BUT NO CLOSER.

37:00.720 --> 37:06.430
NOW IF I JUST HAD AN ENDING
TO MY BOOK, I'D HAVE ALL
THE ANSWERS.

37:06.470 --> 37:08.100
WE DON'T KNOW WHO KILLED
BRUCE BORDEN.

37:08.140 --> 37:11.350
[JAKE] I DON'T CARE.
[GARRISON] BUT MAGGIE DOES.

37:11.390 --> 37:13.440
[JAKE] NOT NECESSARILY.

37:13.480 --> 37:17.230
[GARRISON] WHERE DID
WE GO WRONG?
[JAKE] GOOD QUESTION.

37:17.270 --> 37:21.690
WE WENT WRONG WHEN WE FOLLOWED
THE TRACK THAT BRUCE WAS TRYING
TO EXTORT THAT OIL GUY.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.150
[GARRISON] THE BLACKMAIL?
[JAKE] THE BLACKMAIL.

37:23.200 --> 37:26.200
WHICH YOU PRACTICALLY RAMMED
DOWN HER THROAT.

37:30.080 --> 37:32.040
[GARRISON] SHE WAS LYING THE
ENTIRE TIME.

37:32.080 --> 37:33.540
THERE WAS NO BLACKMAIL.

37:33.580 --> 37:35.370
SHE JUST SAID THAT TO GET US
OFF THE TRACK.

37:35.420 --> 37:38.500
[JAKE] YEAH BUT SHE HAD AN
ALIBI, REMEMBER THE...

37:38.540 --> 37:39.960
THE HAIRDRESSER.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.420
[GARRISON] THE ONE-ARMED
CLIENT IN "TO KILL A MURDERER",

37:42.470 --> 37:44.470
ALSO HAD ALIBI:
THE HAIRDRESSER.

37:44.510 --> 37:47.470
BUT IT TURNS OUT THE HAIRCUT
WAS AT THE CLIENT'S HOUSE.

37:47.510 --> 37:49.100
NO OTHER WITNESSES.

37:49.140 --> 37:50.930
[JAKE] THE WITNESS WAS LYING.

37:50.970 --> 37:51.970
[GARRISON] THEY ALWAYS DO.

37:52.020 --> 37:53.390
&lt;JAKE RECEIVES A TEXT MESSAGE&gt;

37:54.310 --> 37:56.690
[GARRISON] SO... LET'S GO.

38:02.570 --> 38:03.820
[JAKE] ALRIGHT.

38:03.860 --> 38:05.400
BUT ONLY FOR HALF AN HOUR.

38:05.450 --> 38:08.450
&lt;♪♪&gt;

38:13.790 --> 38:14.960
[JAKE] SLAM YOUR DOOR.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
[GARRISON] WHAT?
[JAKE] SLAM YOUR DOOR!

38:17.920 --> 38:19.130
[GARRISON] WHAT ARE WE DOING?

38:19.170 --> 38:20.420
[JAKE] WE'RE PRETENDING
WE'RE LOOKING FOR GLASS.

38:20.460 --> 38:22.760
[GARRISON] WHAT GLASS?
[JAKE] JUST IMPROVISE WITH ME,

38:22.800 --> 38:25.720
OKAY? TAKE THIS.

38:25.760 --> 38:27.550
TAKE THIS BAGGY.

38:27.590 --> 38:30.930
HOLD IT UP TO THE LIGHT
SO SHE CAN SEE.

38:30.970 --> 38:33.220
[JAKE] &lt;SHOUTING&gt; ALRIGHT!

38:33.270 --> 38:35.060
OKAY, I THINK WE GOT IT!

38:43.360 --> 38:44.690
[MAGGIE] WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

38:44.740 --> 38:45.360
[JAKE] HEY THERE MAGGIE.

38:45.400 --> 38:48.910
[GARRISON] GOOD EVENING MAGGIE.

38:48.950 --> 38:51.490
[JAKE] WE'RE JUST CHECKING TO
SEE IF THE GLASS IN YOUR TIRE

38:51.530 --> 38:54.750
HERE MATCHES THE GLASS FROM
THE HEAD LIGHT IN THE CAR THAT

38:54.790 --> 38:56.960
KILLED BRUCE.
[MAGGIE] WHAT?

38:57.000 --> 38:58.370
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

38:58.420 --> 39:01.090
[GARRISON] THE WHOLE BLACKMAIL
THING WAS REALLY CLEVER.

39:01.130 --> 39:03.960
[JAKE] YEAH IT REALLY KNOCKED
US OFF THE SCENT.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.420
[GARRISON] YOU WERE JEALOUS
BECAUSE BRUCE WAS HAVING AN

39:05.460 --> 39:07.880
AFFAIR WITH GRACE.
[JAKE] NOW I'M GUESSING THAT

39:07.930 --> 39:10.430
YOU TOOK YOUR CAR, DROVE IT TO
THE PARKING GARAGE. YOU GOT IN

39:10.470 --> 39:13.260
BRUCE'S CAR, RAN HIM OVER,
THEN YOU CAME HOME IN YOUR OWN

39:13.310 --> 39:15.390
CAR AGAIN. I GUESS YOU WEREN'T
COUNTING ON THE FACT THAT

39:15.430 --> 39:20.900
YOU'D RUN OVER THE GLASS FROM
THE HEADLIGHTS, HUH?

39:20.940 --> 39:23.520
[MAGGIE] WELL...
[JAKE] YEAH.

39:23.570 --> 39:25.820
WE'VE GOT THE EVIDENCE.

39:25.860 --> 39:28.490
SO WHY DON'T YOU TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED?

39:32.120 --> 39:34.450
[MAGGIE] I DIDN'T MEAN TO--
I JUST-- NO I MEANT--

39:34.490 --> 39:36.370
I MEANT TO KILL HIM.

39:36.410 --> 39:39.540
HE WAS SUCH A BASTARD,
YOU KNOW?

39:39.580 --> 39:41.580
[GARRISON] YEAH, WE KNOW.

39:43.590 --> 39:45.590
&lt;LESLIE'S PHONE RINGS&gt;

39:48.470 --> 39:50.510
[CHRISTIAN] YOU'RE GOING TO
DISAPPOINT SOME FELLOW?

39:50.550 --> 39:52.640
[LESLIE] WELL, HE KEPT ME
WAITING.

39:52.680 --> 39:55.510
[CHRISTIAN] HOW LONG?
[LESLIE] LONG ENOUGH.

39:55.560 --> 39:58.140
[CHRISTIAN] SOMETHING I'LL
REMEMBER NEVER TO DO.

39:58.180 --> 40:00.560
[LESLIE] IS THAT RIGHT?
[CHRISTIAN] THAT'S RIGHT.

40:00.600 --> 40:02.560
[LESLIE] THAT'S NOT A
NEWFOUNDLAND ACCENT.

40:02.610 --> 40:03.860
[CHRISTIAN] IT USED TO BE.

40:03.900 --> 40:08.150
BEEN AWAY A LONG TIME.
[LESLIE] WHAT DO YOU DO?

40:08.190 --> 40:09.650
[CHRISTIAN] WHATEVER I WANT.

40:09.700 --> 40:12.490
I WON THE LOTTERY TICKET,
BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

40:12.530 --> 40:16.160
SO NOW I PLAY MUSIC,
HOCKEY, I TRAVEL.

40:16.200 --> 40:18.580
I HAVE A LOT OF HOBBIES.
[LESLIE] THAT SOUNDS LIKE A

40:18.620 --> 40:20.040
LOAD OF CRAP IF I EVER HEARD
ONE.

40:20.080 --> 40:21.040
[CHRISTIAN] NO FLIES ON YOU.

40:21.080 --> 40:22.580
[LESLIE] HOW LONG ARE YOU IN
ST. JOHNS?

40:22.630 --> 40:24.460
[CHRISTIAN] AS LONG AS YOU
WANT.

40:24.500 --> 40:26.340
[LESLIE] OH GOD.

40:26.380 --> 40:28.210
YOU SOUND LIKE THE GUY
THAT STOOD ME UP.

40:28.260 --> 40:30.670
[CHRISTIAN] HOPEFULLY NOT AS
DUMB.

40:30.720 --> 40:35.140
[LESLIE] RIGHT, WELL IT WAS
NICE MEETING YOU.

40:35.180 --> 40:36.970
[CHRISTIAN] I HAVE A SIBERIAN
HUSKY.

40:37.010 --> 40:41.060
[LESLIE] GOOD FOR YOU.
[CHRISTIAN] SHALL I WALK YOU?

40:41.100 --> 40:42.480
[LESLIE] DO I LOOK LIKE
A HUSKY?

40:42.520 --> 40:44.650
[CHRISTIAN] NO. BUT YOU KNOW,
CITY CRIME IS ON THE RISE.

40:44.690 --> 40:46.480
I WOULD MAKE A GREAT ESCORT.

40:46.520 --> 40:51.700
[LESLIE] IT'S NICE TO KNOW
CHIVALRY ISN'T ENTIRELY DEAD.

40:51.740 --> 40:55.490
EVEN IF THAT WAS A PLAY
TO GET IN MY PANTS.

40:55.530 --> 40:57.540
SEE YOU AROUND MAINLAND.

40:59.080 --> 41:01.580
[JAKE] LESLIE JUST CALL ME
BACK OKAY, WHEN YOU GET THIS.

41:01.620 --> 41:03.040
[JAKE] UGH!
[GARRISON] WHAT'S THE MATTER?

41:03.080 --> 41:04.670
[JAKE] I CALLED HER TWICE SHE'S
NOT ANSWERING HER PHONE.

41:04.710 --> 41:05.880
LOOK I GOTTA GO.
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE.

41:05.920 --> 41:07.590
[GARRISON] WHAT ABOUT MAGGIE?

41:07.630 --> 41:10.670
[JAKE] WE'LL DROP HER OFF AT
THE COP SHOP ON THE WAY,
ALRIGHT?

41:10.710 --> 41:12.090
HURRY UP!

41:16.640 --> 41:18.680
[JAKE] AH, CRAP!

41:18.720 --> 41:19.970
MAN I MISSED IT.
I MISSED MY CHANCE.

41:20.020 --> 41:20.770
[GARRISON] EASY KILLER.

41:20.810 --> 41:21.680
EASY, EASY.

41:21.730 --> 41:27.570
C'MON HAVE A WHISKEY
ON ME.

41:27.610 --> 41:30.190
TWO WHISKEYS PLEASE.

41:30.230 --> 41:31.650
SO THIS LADY...

41:31.690 --> 41:32.530
OFFICER FRIEND...

41:32.570 --> 41:34.450
WHAT'S HER NAME?
[JAKE] LESLIE.

41:34.490 --> 41:36.160
SERGEANT LESLIE BENNETT.

41:36.200 --> 41:38.330
[GARRISON] THANK YOU.
[GARRISON] YOU SOLVED THE

41:38.370 --> 41:42.660
CRIME, BUT YOU DIDN'T GET THE
GIRL. TOO BAD.

41:42.710 --> 41:46.500
[GARRISON] YEAH.

41:46.540 --> 41:48.000
ALRIGHT.

41:48.040 --> 41:49.750
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

41:49.800 --> 41:51.800
YEAH, OKAY.

41:51.840 --> 41:53.720
I HAVE A FEAR OF COMMITMENT,

41:53.760 --> 41:55.340
AND I DON'T REALLY HOW
TO DEAL WITH WOMEN.

41:55.380 --> 41:56.760
OKAY "REALLY" DEAL WITH WOMEN.

41:56.800 --> 41:58.100
YOU WERE RIGHT.
ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?

41:58.140 --> 42:01.140
[GARRISON] NO. BUT ADMITTING
IT IS THE FIRST STEP. CHEERS.

42:02.600 --> 42:03.890
OH, I CALLED MY AGENT.

42:03.930 --> 42:06.900
GAVE HER THE PITCH FOR
MY NEW BOOK TODAY.

42:06.940 --> 42:09.520
[JAKE] GOOD FOR YOU.
[GARRISON] A P.I. BOOK
OBVIOUSLY.

42:09.570 --> 42:10.860
[JAKE] OBVIOUSLY.

42:10.900 --> 42:12.940
[GARRISON] IT'S A DEPARTURE
FROM MY USUAL MATERIAL.

42:12.990 --> 42:16.700
BUT I FEEL THIS ONE GOES DEEPER
INTO THE HEART OF MY SUBJECT.

42:16.740 --> 42:18.740
[JAKE] REALLY?

42:18.780 --> 42:21.540
[GARRISON] HE'S
A SPECIAL GUY, THE HERO.

42:25.790 --> 42:27.540
[JAKE] IS THAT RIGHT?

42:29.750 --> 42:34.380
I MEAN, SPECIAL.
HE'S MENTALLY CHALLENGED.

42:36.340 --> 42:37.720
BEST OF LUCK, JAKE.

42:37.760 --> 42:40.850
KEEP ON KEEPING ON.

42:40.890 --> 42:42.890
PLEASURE WORKING WITH YOU.
