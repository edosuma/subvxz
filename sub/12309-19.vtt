00:37.099 --> 00:38.737
Detective Sheppard.

00:39.659 --> 00:42.219
Detective Sheppard. Come on, John.

00:42.299 --> 00:44.767
- I'm breaking this with or without you.
- What's she doing here?

00:44.859 --> 00:46.975
Is this victim related to the others?

00:47.059 --> 00:51.098
If we have a serial killer on our hands,
people have a right to know.

00:53.339 --> 00:55.773
The victim was most likely a white male.

00:57.059 --> 00:58.697
Most likely?

00:58.779 --> 01:01.452
No clothes, no ID, wasn't killed here.

01:04.620 --> 01:06.770
Got tire tracks leading from the road.

01:06.860 --> 01:08.373
Based on size, tread-wear and spread,

01:08.460 --> 01:11.338
we're probably talking
an older model pickup.

01:14.180 --> 01:16.819
We've got radiator fluid down here.
Looks like the vehicle has a leak.

01:30.700 --> 01:32.816
Pretty much the same as the other seven.

01:32.900 --> 01:34.777
- Same chest wound.
- Yeah.

01:36.900 --> 01:37.889
No!

01:46.620 --> 01:48.736
I thought I'd seen everything.

01:48.820 --> 01:51.971
Yeah. Me, too. One day, we'll learn.

03:19.782 --> 03:22.979
Thomas Crane.
Reported missing three days ago.

03:23.062 --> 03:26.532
- Thirty-nine years old.
- You think this guy was 39?

03:26.622 --> 03:27.611
Check the dental records.

03:27.702 --> 03:29.658
- It wasn't natural causes.
- Nope.

03:29.742 --> 03:32.779
Looks like some sort of
rapid cellular breakdown.

03:33.342 --> 03:35.140
The other victims

03:35.223 --> 03:38.818
had the same chest wound,
that same bizarre aging.

03:41.383 --> 03:43.897
I read the other autopsies.
The cause was undetermined.

03:43.983 --> 03:46.975
All I know is
we're not dealing with a contagion.

03:47.983 --> 03:49.701
No chemical residue?

03:50.103 --> 03:52.822
Detective, you'll get a copy of my report.

03:54.343 --> 03:58.416
The previous victims all had
radioactive residue around their wounds.

03:58.983 --> 04:00.416
When I'm done.

04:01.943 --> 04:04.332
What'd you say your name was again?

04:04.943 --> 04:06.820
Keller. Jennifer.

04:08.063 --> 04:10.338
I've got eight bodies in three months,

04:10.423 --> 04:11.981
and I don't like it

04:12.063 --> 04:15.339
when the lead coroner on my case
gets replaced by somebody

04:15.423 --> 04:18.620
who doesn't look old enough
to be in medical school.

04:18.702 --> 04:20.454
I guess I'm flattered.

04:21.063 --> 04:23.531
As far as protocol goes,
I've been assigned this autopsy.

04:23.623 --> 04:25.614
And if you have a problem with that,

04:25.703 --> 04:28.582
I'm sure there are other people
you should be talking to about it.

04:28.664 --> 04:30.461
Well, I already did.

04:30.544 --> 04:33.217
Maybe someone feels the need
for some fresh eyes on the case.

04:33.304 --> 04:35.613
They should have just replaced me.

04:37.544 --> 04:38.738
Do you have any leads?

04:38.824 --> 04:40.655
I got a bunch of bodies
being dumped in the desert,

04:40.744 --> 04:43.941
and it looks like
the life's been sucked out of them.

04:44.024 --> 04:45.901
You really think that's possible?

04:45.984 --> 04:49.863
I don't know where you're from,
but out here, anything's possible.

04:56.664 --> 04:59.622
Anyone treated with symptoms
related to radiation poisoning,

04:59.704 --> 05:01.217
go back a month.

05:02.264 --> 05:05.336
No, it's not going to come back to you,
I promise.

05:27.145 --> 05:30.660
Hi. I don't know.

05:31.865 --> 05:34.333
I told you,
they said it was a virus or something.

05:34.425 --> 05:36.495
Probably food poisoning.

05:37.185 --> 05:39.619
You should see the place
they've got me at.

05:39.705 --> 05:41.423
Not exactly Bellagio.

05:42.225 --> 05:45.183
Whole trip's been
a useless waste of time, too.

05:48.185 --> 05:51.734
My nose is bleeding again. I better go.

05:52.425 --> 05:54.620
Yeah, I will. Love you, too.

06:08.786 --> 06:10.617
Turn it down, will you?

06:16.346 --> 06:17.825
Son of a bitch.

06:55.866 --> 06:58.665
Sheppard, this is Agent Woolsey, FBl.

06:58.747 --> 07:00.066
Nice to meet you.

07:00.147 --> 07:01.978
What the hell happened to your eye?

07:02.067 --> 07:04.376
This case move jurisdiction?

07:04.467 --> 07:05.616
Not yet.

07:05.707 --> 07:08.346
I'm not at liberty to discuss our interest
at this time,

07:08.427 --> 07:10.736
but I'd appreciate your cooperation.

07:11.627 --> 07:15.176
- Well, I got nothing.
- I'm surprised at that, Detective.

07:15.827 --> 07:17.499
The victims are turning up
much more frequently.

07:17.587 --> 07:19.623
This is obviously a progression.

07:19.707 --> 07:21.186
First few bodies were buried.

07:21.267 --> 07:24.384
We only found them because
coyotes dragged one onto the 564.

07:25.307 --> 07:27.537
Now they're just being dumped out
in the open for the vultures.

07:27.627 --> 07:30.187
So is that more careless or more bold?

07:30.867 --> 07:32.380
Somebody want to tell me
why the coroner's report

07:32.467 --> 07:36.346
on the latest victim shows no signs
of radioactive... What do you call it?

07:36.427 --> 07:37.985
Isotopes.

07:38.067 --> 07:40.740
I assume because there weren't any found.

07:41.267 --> 07:42.416
Well,

07:44.227 --> 07:46.377
there were on the first seven.

07:47.347 --> 07:50.260
- Where are you going?
- I gotta go see a nurse.

07:54.028 --> 07:56.337
Well, this guy was seen yesterday.

07:56.948 --> 07:58.904
- Where is he?
- Well, he's an out-of-towner at a motel.

07:58.988 --> 08:02.105
- The chart should say.
- And you just let him go?

08:02.588 --> 08:03.816
He was seen by a doctor.

08:03.908 --> 08:05.819
We get people in here
with flu-like symptoms all the time.

08:05.908 --> 08:08.422
All right. Well, what made it stand out?

08:08.508 --> 08:11.500
He was also having nosebleeds.
Could have been unrelated.

08:11.588 --> 08:13.067
Also common because of the dry air,

08:13.148 --> 08:15.457
but then you mentioned
radiation poisoning...

08:15.548 --> 08:16.537
Thanks.

08:16.628 --> 08:19.665
Hey, look, if he really was exposed,
it could be serious.

08:19.748 --> 08:21.386
I'll track him down.

08:22.668 --> 08:24.898
Do you want me to take a look
at that eye, John?

08:24.988 --> 08:26.899
No, no. I'm fine.

08:28.428 --> 08:32.261
- Hey. Are you gonna call me?
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.

08:44.188 --> 08:45.907
Do you know that guy?

08:49.309 --> 08:52.426
He checked out yesterday.
That a medical report?

08:52.509 --> 08:53.942
No.

08:54.029 --> 08:57.146
If he had something, I gotta know.
Have that room cleaned up properly.

08:57.229 --> 08:58.582
Wash the sheets, you know?

08:58.669 --> 08:59.863
Yeah, wash those sheets.

08:59.949 --> 09:02.827
In the meantime,
let me look at your register.

11:24.952 --> 11:26.590
They were fighting.
She tried to break it up.

11:26.672 --> 11:28.788
You know, it was an accident.

11:29.712 --> 11:33.705
- You couldn't find the finger?
- We were up all night looking for it.

11:33.912 --> 11:35.948
Yeah, but you found it?

11:36.032 --> 11:38.671
Out on the lawn, when the sun came up.

11:38.752 --> 11:40.708
I got it in the fridge.

11:40.792 --> 11:42.066
And where's the housekeeper?

11:42.152 --> 11:44.985
She's at the hospital.
She lost a ton of blood.

11:45.072 --> 11:47.632
Really? Don't they need the finger?

11:47.712 --> 11:51.022
Nah, it was too late to reattach it.
She'll be all right.

12:00.152 --> 12:02.188
- What finger was it?
- Pinky.

12:03.512 --> 12:04.866
And you still got it?

12:04.953 --> 12:06.625
What are you supposed to do
with a finger?

12:06.713 --> 12:10.023
Besides, I thought maybe
she'd still want it, you know?

12:12.713 --> 12:15.273
- And what about the dogs?
- Well, what about them?

12:15.353 --> 12:19.392
- You gotta get rid of them, no?
- What do you mean? I love those dogs.

12:19.473 --> 12:21.191
I know. I'll see him.

12:30.033 --> 12:32.547
Nice hand. Got me again.

12:32.633 --> 12:35.943
- It's almost like you can read minds.
- Only yours.

12:36.793 --> 12:40.308
Look at this guy.
He won't even look at me!

12:40.393 --> 12:42.953
You've been taking my money all night,
you won't even look at me?

12:43.033 --> 12:46.150
Whoa, whoa. Leave it alone.
He's a freaking whacko.

12:51.633 --> 12:53.703
Aren't you a little out of your league here?

12:53.793 --> 12:55.625
What are you, my mother?

12:58.034 --> 12:59.752
Go ahead. I'll ante.

14:33.355 --> 14:34.834
$22,000 to call.

14:45.636 --> 14:48.070
- He doesn't have it.
- Shut up.

14:57.996 --> 14:59.952
He didn't have it! No way.

15:01.756 --> 15:03.906
Wait, where are you going?
You can't leave now!

15:03.996 --> 15:05.907
Look at this guy. Hey!

17:32.759 --> 17:34.238
Oh, jeez.

17:40.079 --> 17:41.831
You don't think that's contagious, do you?

17:41.919 --> 17:44.228
You said the guy next door
checked out yesterday.

17:44.319 --> 17:47.231
I never saw him. He used the TV.

17:48.839 --> 17:50.591
Don't touch anything.

17:51.639 --> 17:52.674
Sure.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.119
What is it?

18:14.760 --> 18:16.876
It's a crime scene. Get lost.

18:43.760 --> 18:45.034
Detective.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.755
We got another body here.
I was just about to call it in.

18:49.840 --> 18:52.196
I heard about what happened
at the casino.

18:52.281 --> 18:53.316
You following me?

18:53.401 --> 18:55.961
There's a satellite locator on your car.

18:56.041 --> 18:59.511
If you don't mind,
we'd like you to come for a little drive.

18:59.601 --> 19:01.239
Do I have a choice?

19:03.401 --> 19:04.516
Right.

19:30.321 --> 19:33.119
No, I'm not FBl.

19:46.722 --> 19:47.996
He won't sign it.

19:48.082 --> 19:50.801
- Well, we should tell him anyway.
- We can't trust him.

19:50.882 --> 19:53.191
Well, he might be able to help us.

19:54.682 --> 19:56.354
Let me at least try.

20:04.482 --> 20:07.633
Detective, I'm Dr. Rodney McKay.

20:09.202 --> 20:11.716
Just need to ask you a few questions
about your investigation

20:11.802 --> 20:13.235
and subsequent contact with the suspect,

20:13.322 --> 20:15.199
and you can be on your way.

20:15.282 --> 20:17.796
Well, I'm not signing anything
or talking to anyone

20:17.882 --> 20:20.442
until I gets some answers myself.

20:20.522 --> 20:23.559
I realize you have no way of grasping
what's going on here.

20:23.642 --> 20:26.873
There's really only one thing
you need to understand.

20:26.962 --> 20:30.841
If you fail to cooperate,
I have the power to ruin your life.

20:31.442 --> 20:34.753
Well, then you don't realize
how little I have to lose.

20:35.203 --> 20:37.273
I know everything about you.

20:38.083 --> 20:39.801
You've never been married.

20:39.883 --> 20:41.794
The only thing you own is a car.

20:41.883 --> 20:45.922
You have $2,363 in the bank
and are $13,000 in debt,

20:46.003 --> 20:49.837
not counting off-the-books
gambling losses to a guy named Mikey.

20:51.523 --> 20:52.797
What else?

20:52.883 --> 20:57.832
You finally passed your detective exam
after four years and two failed attempts

20:57.923 --> 21:01.359
and now barely scrape by
on quarterly performance reviews.

21:01.443 --> 21:03.593
Occasionally, you solve a case.

21:03.683 --> 21:05.514
But, unfortunately,
the charges don't always stick

21:05.603 --> 21:08.959
due to the means in which
the evidence was collected.

21:09.043 --> 21:13.036
You don't have a partner, because
no one can stand working with you.

21:14.283 --> 21:18.242
- Am I getting this right?
- I also like spearmint gum.

21:20.363 --> 21:21.682
Have some.

21:21.763 --> 21:23.959
- I was joking.
- No, you weren't.

21:25.804 --> 21:28.034
Let's go back further, shall we?

21:28.804 --> 21:31.034
You were a helicopter pilot in Afghanistan

21:31.124 --> 21:33.479
but were dishonorably discharged
for disobeying orders

21:33.564 --> 21:36.476
and trying to rescue a field medic
trapped behind enemy lines.

21:36.564 --> 21:39.032
You were shot down, obviously survived,
but unfortunately,

21:39.124 --> 21:43.117
the crash killed four American soldiers
along with eight civilians.

21:44.524 --> 21:45.718
You avoided jail time.

21:45.804 --> 21:49.035
The record was sealed
for various political reasons.

21:49.124 --> 21:51.080
These things happen, right?

21:51.164 --> 21:54.554
Somehow you've managed
to live with yourself since then,

21:56.324 --> 21:59.839
but I'm not sure other people would
if they knew the truth.

22:01.124 --> 22:02.796
I don't really care.

22:04.524 --> 22:05.593
Yeah.

22:06.484 --> 22:07.997
That's too bad.

22:17.125 --> 22:20.561
You know,
I once met another version of you.

22:22.365 --> 22:23.241
He was very different.

22:25.605 --> 22:29.359
- What?
- Nothing is what you think it is.

22:29.445 --> 22:32.243
That really doesn't come
as a surprise to me.

22:32.805 --> 22:33.920
Look.

22:37.445 --> 22:41.404
We're not bad guys.
We just want to keep the planet safe.

22:42.245 --> 22:44.076
I doubt that very much.

22:46.245 --> 22:48.839
I don't expect you'll believe me at first.

22:48.925 --> 22:51.200
I'm about to tell you
some incredible things.

22:51.285 --> 22:54.834
Wormhole travel through
a device called a stargate,

22:54.925 --> 22:59.555
ancient races of humans on other planets,
other dimensions in space and time,

23:00.565 --> 23:03.637
even infinite variations
of our known reality

23:04.325 --> 23:06.123
where alternate versions of you
and I play out events

23:06.206 --> 23:09.323
in ways you can't possibly imagine.

23:10.086 --> 23:11.519
Space aliens?

24:03.607 --> 24:07.441
It was found under a mile of ice
in Antarctica five years ago

24:07.527 --> 24:09.279
and later moved here.

24:09.367 --> 24:13.440
It runs on a power source
that extracts energy from vacuum space.

24:13.527 --> 24:18.555
We call it a ZPM. Well, ZPM.
Sorry. I'm Canadian.

24:18.647 --> 24:19.636
If you have the right genetic code,

24:19.727 --> 24:24.039
it allows you to control some pretty cool
weaponry remotely, with your mind.

24:24.127 --> 24:25.924
It's how we were able to defeat
the Wraith hive ship

24:26.007 --> 24:28.475
that attacked Earth three months ago.

24:29.127 --> 24:31.357
- Are there more?
- What, chairs?

24:31.447 --> 24:34.519
- No, aliens.
- Yeah. Lots more.

24:35.647 --> 24:37.365
Fortunately, they're in another galaxy.

24:37.447 --> 24:40.837
And, for now,
they don't know where Earth is.

24:44.967 --> 24:46.241
Detective?

24:49.808 --> 24:53.960
They're called Darts,
small, fast, single-pilot attack ships.

24:54.048 --> 24:55.925
We're lucky we took out the hive
as quickly as we did.

24:56.008 --> 24:58.886
Each one can carry
hundreds of these things.

24:58.968 --> 25:01.846
As it was, our 302s had quite a dog fight,

25:03.408 --> 25:06.002
our own space-worthy fighters

25:06.088 --> 25:09.763
developed from alien technology
gathered from stargate travel.

25:09.848 --> 25:12.203
And the guy dumping bodies in the desert?

25:12.288 --> 25:15.325
He's an alien, a Wraith.

25:15.408 --> 25:19.686
A genetic hybrid between human beings
and something called an iratus bug.

25:19.768 --> 25:21.599
Feeds on human energy,

25:21.688 --> 25:25.966
literally saps the life out of people
using a sucker on their hands.

25:28.328 --> 25:31.479
I suppose it all sounds
like science fiction to you.

25:32.088 --> 25:33.840
I'm not really a fan.

25:34.608 --> 25:36.963
We did a good job of cleaning up
the stragglers after the attack,

25:37.048 --> 25:40.246
but, obviously,
at least one slipped through the net.

25:45.849 --> 25:49.285
My team and I usually operate
out of Atlantis in the Pegasus Galaxy,

25:49.369 --> 25:51.678
but we were called back to Earth
to deal with this situation

25:51.769 --> 25:53.760
because of our expertise with the Wraith.

25:53.849 --> 25:55.043
Now, the one that you've encountered

25:55.129 --> 25:57.643
has obviously been doing a fairly good job
of blending in.

25:57.729 --> 25:59.560
What, disguising himself as a human?

25:59.649 --> 26:03.722
Based on your description
and the video surveillance from the casino.

26:04.169 --> 26:06.364
What do they normally look like?

26:11.849 --> 26:14.044
Normally, they look like that.

26:33.530 --> 26:34.883
Why do they do it?

26:34.970 --> 26:37.359
Feed on humans?
Well, that's just what they are.

26:37.450 --> 26:39.122
We're just cattle to them.

26:39.210 --> 26:43.089
Fish in a pond!
Busy, busy, lots to do, here and there.

26:43.170 --> 26:47.049
This one fancies himself a bit of a poet.
Not good.

26:47.130 --> 26:50.281
Dry as a desert outside. No place to go.

26:50.370 --> 26:52.281
He's also delirious from starvation.

26:52.370 --> 26:54.930
Eat up! Get stronger.

26:55.010 --> 26:59.128
Think and hope. Think and hope.

26:59.210 --> 27:00.643
Don't look now!

27:01.770 --> 27:03.965
Keep dreaming.

27:04.050 --> 27:07.167
There must be some other reason
for your existence.

27:07.770 --> 27:10.079
Did you get anything from him?

27:10.170 --> 27:13.560
Nothing. Believe me,
we've tried everything.

27:14.250 --> 27:17.447
Defiance tastes like life itself.

27:18.730 --> 27:21.689
No river. No water.

27:22.811 --> 27:24.324
Dry as a desert!

27:25.091 --> 27:26.763
Darkness all around.

27:27.691 --> 27:29.682
The harvest moon is rising.

27:31.291 --> 27:33.168
Wraith are never-ending.

27:35.731 --> 27:37.528
I know the future.

27:40.291 --> 27:41.804
Come inside.

27:43.091 --> 27:45.480
I'll show you

27:45.571 --> 27:47.289
your destiny,

27:48.691 --> 27:52.001
John Sheppard.

27:55.731 --> 27:57.687
They can get in your head.

28:07.731 --> 28:08.959
You okay?

28:10.412 --> 28:13.768
- People ever gonna know the truth?
- Not my decision.

28:13.852 --> 28:16.924
Personally, I think people choose to live
in their own happy little delusions.

28:17.012 --> 28:19.685
They don't really want to know the truth.

28:19.892 --> 28:21.928
- Jennifer.
- Rodney.

28:25.332 --> 28:28.529
The other victims
had radioactive residue on them.

28:28.612 --> 28:31.365
They all did. Once we got wind of it,
and our suspicions were confirmed,

28:31.452 --> 28:33.886
the whole thing was ultimately
gonna be covered up,

28:33.972 --> 28:36.691
but you tracked down the target
before that could happen.

28:36.772 --> 28:38.125
Well, in serial cases,

28:38.212 --> 28:40.328
you're supposed to look for any victims
who got away.

28:40.412 --> 28:41.970
Which is how you found the motel

28:42.052 --> 28:44.566
and the man who reported
radiation sickness.

28:44.652 --> 28:45.641
He was most likely exposed

28:45.732 --> 28:47.131
'cause he was in the room
next door to the Wraith.

28:47.212 --> 28:49.009
See, we didn't think to look for bystanders

28:49.092 --> 28:52.209
that could have been accidentally exposed
due to proximity.

28:52.292 --> 28:55.090
- To the alien?
- No. No.

28:55.172 --> 28:58.323
However, we do believe
that the radioactive material in this case

28:58.452 --> 29:01.809
is being transferred from the target
to the victims.

29:01.893 --> 29:05.010
But the source is being shielded
from our scanning capabilities.

29:05.093 --> 29:06.367
What is it?

29:08.453 --> 29:12.446
Look, we know that the Wraith don't need
to feed as often as the target does.

29:12.533 --> 29:14.125
I mean, they feed for pleasure,
but not in this case,

29:14.213 --> 29:16.522
not if it means leaving a trail behind.

29:16.613 --> 29:17.728
Some other reason?

29:17.813 --> 29:20.008
If they're sick or injured,
they can regenerate,

29:20.093 --> 29:21.890
but it requires energy.

29:21.973 --> 29:24.362
We believe that the target
is unavoidably exposing himself

29:24.453 --> 29:25.488
to high doses of radiation

29:25.573 --> 29:28.041
and is having to eat
to counteract the effects.

29:28.133 --> 29:29.725
What's the source?

29:31.253 --> 29:33.084
He's building a device.

29:33.813 --> 29:35.690
We're not sure of its intended function,

29:35.773 --> 29:39.766
but we know that he was able to salvage
certain parts from his crashed Dart

29:39.853 --> 29:41.366
before we could get to it.

29:41.453 --> 29:44.047
- Well, what about the rest?
- The Wraith are smart.

29:44.133 --> 29:45.646
It wouldn't take them long to learn
the ins and outs

29:45.733 --> 29:47.564
of the way things work around here.

29:47.653 --> 29:49.484
We have reason to believe
that he's already acquired

29:49.573 --> 29:52.646
some of the necessary materials,
but he needs more.

29:52.734 --> 29:55.851
He also needs untraceable currency,
or we would have found him by now.

29:55.934 --> 29:58.971
So he makes money playing poker?
There's got to be a better way than that.

29:59.054 --> 30:00.453
Well, I guess he could rob a bank,

30:00.534 --> 30:03.446
but it's risky,
and it draws a lot of attention.

30:03.534 --> 30:05.604
No, the Wraith love games,

30:05.694 --> 30:08.731
and with their mental abilities,
they are very good at them.

30:08.814 --> 30:13.251
The following is a worst-case scenario
should the device be detonated.

30:13.334 --> 30:15.802
- Excuse me. Wait here.
- Based on the material that we suspect

30:15.894 --> 30:17.646
has already gone into the core,

30:17.734 --> 30:21.044
- there's a very strong likelihood...
- It's not a bomb.

30:21.134 --> 30:23.807
We need to be prepared
for every possibility.

30:23.894 --> 30:27.091
What would be the point of overcooking
half the United States?

30:27.174 --> 30:29.005
- Revenge.
- Not his first choice.

30:29.094 --> 30:31.562
He wants to send up a flare
signaling the location of Earth

30:31.654 --> 30:32.848
to the rest of the Wraith.

30:32.934 --> 30:34.128
Excuse me.

30:34.214 --> 30:36.489
Rodney, he would not need
that kind of power

30:36.574 --> 30:37.563
to activate a Wraith communicator.

30:37.654 --> 30:41.169
He does if he wants to send a message
to Pegasus and be rescued in his lifetime.

30:41.254 --> 30:42.607
But that would require a massive boost.

30:42.694 --> 30:44.686
Yes! It would require more energy
than he has now.

30:44.775 --> 30:46.686
- Well, not even a ZPM...
- I know!

30:46.775 --> 30:48.049
That kind of burst is uncontrollable.

30:48.135 --> 30:49.124
I never said it wasn't dangerous.

30:49.215 --> 30:51.046
It could open up any number of anomalies.

30:51.135 --> 30:53.729
- Like the inter-dimensional rift?
- Okay. Would you stop bringing that up?

30:53.815 --> 30:54.850
Why do you have to
constantly remind me?

30:54.935 --> 30:56.653
- Especially in front of other people.
- You are such a child.

30:56.735 --> 30:59.203
And yet, I am still smarter than you.

31:00.735 --> 31:03.374
Don't worry. Everything's under control.

31:09.975 --> 31:12.648
Thank you for your cooperation, Detective.

31:12.735 --> 31:16.011
If you think of anything else,
call me at this number.

31:17.535 --> 31:20.288
If he's not finished yet,
why did he stop hiding bodies?

31:20.375 --> 31:23.651
I don't know.
Over-confidence that he can't be caught?

31:27.255 --> 31:29.769
- He left money behind.
- How much?

31:31.095 --> 31:32.528
A few thousand.

31:33.655 --> 31:36.045
Not enough to worry about, I guess.

31:36.536 --> 31:39.733
I realize that this is not
gonna be easy for you.

31:40.136 --> 31:42.775
I'll be in touch. In the meantime,
you're just gonna have to trust

31:42.856 --> 31:45.609
that we'll handle things as best as we can.

31:45.696 --> 31:48.893
I still can't figure out why you trusted me
in the first place.

31:48.976 --> 31:51.570
There's something else I know about you.

31:51.656 --> 31:55.285
It wasn't in the sealed file,
nor am I on record at the time.

31:57.136 --> 31:58.808
That field medic,

31:58.896 --> 32:02.332
the one you defied orders to go back
and try and rescue,

32:03.016 --> 32:04.369
you knew her personally.

32:04.456 --> 32:07.812
You were involved.

32:07.896 --> 32:09.807
Yeah. You know everything.

32:10.856 --> 32:13.086
It was a hard choice.

32:13.176 --> 32:16.885
Certainly, you didn't intend things
to go as badly as they did.

32:17.336 --> 32:20.646
Things just don't always go
the way we plan.

32:24.296 --> 32:25.889
That's it? You're just gonna let me go?

32:25.977 --> 32:27.933
We know where to find you.

32:33.497 --> 32:34.771
Detective.

32:38.137 --> 32:41.368
Remember when I told you
I once met another version of you?

32:41.457 --> 32:42.446
Yeah.

32:42.537 --> 32:44.209
I know you'll probably think
this sounds ridiculous,

32:44.297 --> 32:46.447
but a little while ago,

32:46.537 --> 32:49.370
we accidentally opened a rift
in space-time.

32:49.457 --> 32:51.732
Went through to an alternate
version of reality.

32:51.817 --> 32:54.536
It's very similar to ours in many ways.

32:54.617 --> 32:56.369
I met a team,
much like the one I work with,

32:56.457 --> 32:59.767
only you were the leader. You were a hero.

33:00.857 --> 33:04.532
- Saved the world several times over.
- Doesn't sound much like me.

33:04.617 --> 33:06.573
I don't think there's much difference
between you

33:06.657 --> 33:09.171
and that other John Sheppard I met.

33:09.257 --> 33:13.808
It's amazing how one incident
can entirely alter the course of your life.

33:15.057 --> 33:19.210
Still, I'd like to believe
you have the same strength of character.

33:19.298 --> 33:21.493
That's why I told you the truth.

33:23.778 --> 33:25.496
What do you want me to say?

33:25.578 --> 33:28.172
For now? Nothing.

33:37.978 --> 33:39.650
Border blockades are in place.

33:39.738 --> 33:41.774
Security at commercial airports
are on red alert.

33:41.858 --> 33:43.530
And visual air and ground sweeps
are underway.

33:43.618 --> 33:45.973
<i>Yeah. Census scans from Daedalus
are still coming back negative.</i>

33:46.058 --> 33:48.447
Given the potential range of damage,
an explosive device of this kind...

33:48.538 --> 33:51.814
How many times do I have to tell you?
It is not a bomb.

33:51.898 --> 33:53.411
Do you know,
you have been wrong before.

33:53.498 --> 33:55.329
- Not nearly as often as you.
- Really?

33:55.418 --> 33:58.137
There's been a Wraith out there
for months.

33:58.458 --> 34:01.131
Somehow, he has managed to acquire
the potential capability

34:01.218 --> 34:04.494
to compromise the safety
and security of this planet.

34:04.578 --> 34:08.969
So far, despite all the brain power
and technology at our disposal,

34:09.059 --> 34:12.369
some nobody detective
has come closer than anyone else.

34:12.938 --> 34:15.214
Tell me, please,

34:16.619 --> 34:18.291
how that's possible.

34:20.539 --> 34:21.938
All right. I think...

34:22.018 --> 34:24.054
Doctor, I am not going to accept
that all we can do

34:24.179 --> 34:28.058
is hope the Wraith makes another mistake
and reveals himself.

34:28.139 --> 34:30.175
Find him now,

34:30.259 --> 34:33.012
before he unleashes
whatever he has planned.

34:48.978 --> 34:50.492
What's going on?

35:56.781 --> 35:57.896
<i>They feed on human energy,</i>

35:57.981 --> 36:01.690
literally sap the life out of people
using a sucker on their hand.

36:03.461 --> 36:05.372
<i>Dry as a desert outside.</i>

36:07.141 --> 36:08.176
<i>No place to go.</i>

36:12.101 --> 36:14.661
He wants to send up a flare
signaling the location of Earth

36:14.741 --> 36:15.810
to the rest of the Wraith.

36:18.181 --> 36:20.251
Wraith are never-ending.

36:20.741 --> 36:22.493
I know the future.

36:23.981 --> 36:25.619
But that would require a massive boost.

36:25.701 --> 36:27.692
Yes! He needs more power than he has.

36:29.421 --> 36:32.891
I'll show you your destiny,

36:32.981 --> 36:35.495
John Sheppard.

37:02.382 --> 37:04.498
Recalibrating the scanners to look
for similar isotopes

37:04.582 --> 37:08.257
at maximum sensitivity just shows us
huge patches of radioactive desert.

37:08.342 --> 37:09.980
From 40-year-old nuclear testing.

37:10.062 --> 37:11.541
Yeah, we're talking
hundreds of square miles.

37:11.622 --> 37:13.453
That's like a needle in a haystack.

37:13.542 --> 37:15.578
Or he could've abandoned
whatever resources he had

37:15.662 --> 37:16.777
and just gone into hiding.

37:16.862 --> 37:20.138
Yes, he probably got a job as a Klingon
at Star Trek: The Experience.

37:20.222 --> 37:23.134
- That shut down.
- Really? Damn. I wanted to see that.

37:23.222 --> 37:26.294
Dr. McKay, there's a call for you.
John Sheppard.

37:28.862 --> 37:30.774
<i>- Hello?
- I found him.</i>

37:30.863 --> 37:33.377
- He thinks he's found him. How?
- I remembered

37:33.463 --> 37:37.376
the trailer from the motel.
It's one of those old Silver Bullets.

37:37.463 --> 37:39.454
<i>It's just a hunch.
You said he needed more power,</i>

37:39.543 --> 37:42.979
so I drove along some of the more
remote power lines into the city.

37:43.983 --> 37:46.736
Harriman. He's gonna tap into the grid.

37:47.623 --> 37:50.342
We should have
John Sheppard's coordinates.

38:00.703 --> 38:02.056
Listen to me.

38:02.143 --> 38:05.101
I know what I said, but do not engage.
Do you hear me?

38:10.743 --> 38:12.620
Oh, crap.

38:25.264 --> 38:27.494
ETA to target, three minutes.

41:21.347 --> 41:24.544
We have widespread power outages
being reported across the state.

41:24.627 --> 41:26.185
<i>Daedalus is transmitting new sensor data.</i>

41:26.267 --> 41:27.939
Got it. A massive subspace event.

41:28.027 --> 41:30.746
Ten times the power of an active stargate
and getting stronger.

41:30.827 --> 41:32.385
Its scope increases
the longer it stays active.

41:32.467 --> 41:33.582
What is it?

41:33.667 --> 41:38.297
It's a transmission. Coded in Wraith.
I'm working on it.

41:38.387 --> 41:40.457
Target has been acquired, sir.

41:41.147 --> 41:42.341
Take it out.

42:07.348 --> 42:10.181
We have a direct hit!
Target has been neutralized.

42:10.268 --> 42:12.304
The transmission has ceased.

42:16.268 --> 42:18.657
It contained the location of Earth.

42:19.028 --> 42:22.384
- Is there a chance it reached Pegasus?
- No.

42:24.108 --> 42:25.700
Rodney, I've seen
this energy signature before.

42:25.788 --> 42:26.903
I know.

42:27.828 --> 42:30.820
It looks like the device tore a small hole
in the space-time continuum.

42:30.908 --> 42:32.705
- Do you think that was intended?
- No. Couldn't be.

42:32.788 --> 42:34.506
Most of the energy meant to carry
the Wraith transmission

42:34.588 --> 42:35.704
went through the rift.

42:35.789 --> 42:36.824
To where?

42:36.909 --> 42:40.299
- Well, there's no way to know for sure.
- Other realities.

42:40.469 --> 42:43.506
I'm sorry,
but I only care about us right now.

42:43.589 --> 42:46.820
If John Sheppard hadn't found that Wraith
when he did,

42:46.909 --> 42:50.185
that transmission definitely
would have made it through to Pegasus.

42:50.269 --> 42:51.338
He saved our asses.

42:51.429 --> 42:54.341
Yes, but that transmission
would have been stronger

42:54.429 --> 42:57.148
in any other reality exposed to the rift.

43:00.349 --> 43:03.068
We could be in a lot of trouble right now.

43:04.305 --> 43:10.246
