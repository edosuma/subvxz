00:02.470 --> 00:06.480
<i>In</i> Elder Tale, <i>a quest is a type of mission.</i>

00:07.180 --> 00:09.320
<i>There are many types,</i>

00:09.320 --> 00:12.370
<i>ranging from simply finding missing 
persons to grand adventures,</i>

00:12.370 --> 00:14.490
<i>each with its own unique reward.</i>

00:15.420 --> 00:17.540
<i>Experience, gold, items...</i>

00:17.990 --> 00:20.490
<i>Magical knowledge or crafting recipes.</i>

00:21.480 --> 00:23.570
<i>The whistle to summon griffons</i>

00:23.570 --> 00:27.120
<i>was one of the completion 
rewards for a huge quest.</i>

02:00.500 --> 02:02.910
Our warehouse is looking pretty bare...

02:02.910 --> 02:05.820
We should buy up whatever we can.

02:05.820 --> 02:07.670
Ever since the Apocalypse,

02:07.670 --> 02:11.980
there are fewer guilds that will 
leave towns to fight for ingredients.

02:12.260 --> 02:15.130
Fighting in your own body is pretty scary...

02:15.130 --> 02:18.040
That's why lots of people are switching to crafting,

02:18.040 --> 02:20.490
so ingredients are becoming harder to find.

02:21.040 --> 02:24.120
In the race to buy them, the large 
guilds have an advantage...

02:24.450 --> 02:29.940
The Roderic Merchant Guild and the Marine 
Agency have absorbed many smaller guilds.

02:30.410 --> 02:35.150
We may be the third biggest crafting guild,  
but it doesn't mean we can take it easy.

02:35.750 --> 02:38.890
We must take full advantage of this chance.

02:39.220 --> 02:40.260
Chance?

02:42.350 --> 02:48.270
<b>Villain in Glasses</b>

02:44.920 --> 02:46.160
Villain in Glasses.

02:51.760 --> 02:53.420
L-Let me go...

02:53.420 --> 02:56.190
I don't have time to waste here.

02:56.190 --> 02:58.430
You look so relaxed, Henrietta.

02:58.430 --> 03:00.070
My heart is pounding...

03:00.290 --> 03:01.980
I'm not relaxed...

03:01.980 --> 03:04.830
That's why I'm trying to calm my mind.

03:04.830 --> 03:06.870
Assassins are not tools to help you relax.

03:06.870 --> 03:08.580
I'm going into battle.

03:08.580 --> 03:11.580
<b>Dragon's Nest</b>

03:08.990 --> 03:10.870
I must stay strong!

03:18.280 --> 03:19.590
Hey, sorry for keeping you.

03:21.190 --> 03:23.850
You look pretty scary, Marie...

03:21.300 --> 03:23.840
<b>Karashin 
Race/ Human 
Summoner, Lv. 90 
Shopping Street 8</b>

03:24.280 --> 03:25.100
No...

03:25.100 --> 03:27.180
It really has been a while, Karashin.

03:27.180 --> 03:31.100
I'm told you two have known 
one another for a long time.

03:31.100 --> 03:33.860
When we were just starting out, 
we went hunting together.

03:34.370 --> 03:38.740
But once we founded our own guilds, 
we both became so busy...

03:38.740 --> 03:43.260
We both started guilds. But isn't yours 
huge, with seven hundred members?

03:43.260 --> 03:44.870
Far bigger than mine.

03:45.140 --> 03:47.020
Well, there are still larger guilds,

03:47.020 --> 03:50.430
like the Marine Agency or the 
Roderic Merchant Guild.

03:51.270 --> 03:54.880
Well? What brings you here today? 
You had something to ask?

03:56.180 --> 03:58.160
<i>That's a businessman's face...</i>

04:00.360 --> 04:02.300
I'd like your help with ingredient stocks.

04:02.690 --> 04:05.520
Ingredients for our guild to use.

04:05.520 --> 04:08.720
We're trying to outsource our resource collection.

04:09.150 --> 04:13.400
Specifically, we need young deer 
meat, lettuce, tomatoes...

04:13.400 --> 04:21.190
Flour, potatoes, haruharu fish, and grouse meat.

04:14.140 --> 04:17.260
<i>Just as I thought, she's here for 
ingredients for Crescent Moon.</i>

04:17.770 --> 04:22.180
<i>Once you eat their food, 
you can't go back to the old stuff.</i>

04:22.180 --> 04:24.950
<i>If I could get all that business for myself...</i>

04:24.950 --> 04:26.370
Ingredients?

04:26.570 --> 04:28.320
How much and at what price?

04:34.990 --> 04:36.440
I see...

04:36.440 --> 04:39.340
<i>At that price, it's not a bad deal.</i>

04:39.790 --> 04:40.840
<i>But...</i>

04:40.840 --> 04:43.650
It's a very good deal for them.

04:44.040 --> 04:48.440
But that doesn't mean he can simply 
agree to whatever is proposed.

04:48.440 --> 04:49.350
Indeed.

04:49.530 --> 04:52.060
They'll try to improve the terms.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.770
Anyway, these are for

04:55.290 --> 04:57.650
Crescent Moon, correct?

04:57.650 --> 04:58.710
That's right.

04:58.710 --> 05:00.800
I'm told your business is going well.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.110
Thank you.

05:02.470 --> 05:06.110
Our chefs are pleased everyone 
enjoys the food so much!

05:06.490 --> 05:09.620
So are you using a new recipe?

05:09.990 --> 05:12.120
Our chefs are simply that good.

05:13.970 --> 05:15.930
This is right, isn't it, Shiro?

05:15.930 --> 05:17.130
I don't think

05:17.130 --> 05:18.940
I can keep this up...

05:19.240 --> 05:20.210
Listen.

05:20.680 --> 05:24.250
No matter what happens, just keep smiling.

05:24.600 --> 05:25.700
Smiling?

05:25.700 --> 05:28.390
Yes, that's the most important thing.

05:28.770 --> 05:33.020
As long as you keep smiling, 
your partner will handle the rest.

05:36.510 --> 05:39.650
<i>She's going to need some help soon.</i>

05:40.170 --> 05:43.290
I can give this serious consideration...

05:43.290 --> 05:47.950
But have you thought of a partnership 
with Shopping Street 8,

05:47.950 --> 05:50.210
in order to grow your business—

05:50.210 --> 05:51.950
Excuse me, Karashin...

05:52.630 --> 05:54.280
But it's time.

05:54.280 --> 05:55.300
Time?

05:55.300 --> 05:57.960
Yes, our other guests have arrived.

05:57.960 --> 05:59.060
I'm sorry...

05:59.060 --> 06:02.460
Since I knew you already, 
I slipped you in a bit early.

06:02.710 --> 06:06.310
But Henrietta says we should 
really handle this fairly.

06:06.310 --> 06:08.470
So... What does all this mean?

06:08.740 --> 06:10.340
The Marine Agency,

06:10.340 --> 06:13.600
as well as the Roderic Merchant 
Guild, will be coming, too.

06:13.600 --> 06:14.980
But on to other matters...

06:15.280 --> 06:16.030
Wha—

06:16.030 --> 06:17.960
What do you mean by "other matters"?

06:17.960 --> 06:19.550
Well, investment...

06:19.550 --> 06:22.980
Specifically, selling Crescent Moon.

06:24.780 --> 06:27.870
Hey, why don't we ask Karashin to stay?

06:27.870 --> 06:30.850
Until we have a stable source of ingredients,

06:30.850 --> 06:32.990
we can't move to the next step.

06:33.320 --> 06:35.160
H-Hold on a second...

06:35.480 --> 06:38.510
What is the Crescent Moon Alliance thinking?

06:38.510 --> 06:40.670
What do you mean by "investment"?

06:40.960 --> 06:41.890
Well—

06:42.890 --> 06:46.590
How much is Shopping Street 8 willing to pay

06:46.590 --> 06:49.000
for that information?

06:49.290 --> 06:53.890
We'll agree to the matter we 
were discussing just now.

06:53.890 --> 06:58.400
We'll get what you want, in any 
bulk you want, for this price.

07:02.770 --> 07:03.730
Thirty thousand.

07:04.020 --> 07:04.680
Thirty—

07:06.310 --> 07:07.980
Fine... Agreed!

07:07.980 --> 07:11.700
On behalf of Shopping Street 8, 
I accept the contract...

07:11.930 --> 07:13.240
That's great!

07:13.520 --> 07:16.830
Now we can let him stay for the next part, right?

07:16.830 --> 07:18.710
Of course... I don't mind at all.

07:24.410 --> 07:27.640
What's your tailoring level?

07:27.640 --> 07:28.760
Level 32.

07:29.170 --> 07:32.050
Then you can make level-30 leather armor...

07:32.310 --> 07:34.660
Today, make leather aprons to raise your skill.

07:34.800 --> 07:35.760
Yes, sir.

07:38.330 --> 07:41.850
<i>Since then, Shiroe has been 
in touch several times.</i>

07:43.020 --> 07:46.140
<i>He has many friends now.</i>

07:47.140 --> 07:50.650
<i>He and I are in the same world.</i>

07:51.500 --> 07:53.210
<i>We're in the same world, but...</i>

07:54.410 --> 07:57.910
<i>This is how disgusting the world looks to me.</i>

08:02.040 --> 08:04.250
What is this?!

08:05.370 --> 08:06.250
Minori!

08:06.580 --> 08:07.690
It's you, isn't it?

08:09.040 --> 08:10.350
What is this?

08:11.250 --> 08:12.470
<i>That day...</i>

08:12.470 --> 08:16.180
<i>The day reality and</i> Elder Tale <i>switched places...</i>

08:20.090 --> 08:25.290
<i>All I could do was cry and pray 
that someone would save me.</i>

08:32.830 --> 08:36.450
<i>Tohya was already starting to accept it...</i>

08:37.150 --> 08:38.870
<i>Walking through this world.</i>

08:39.560 --> 08:40.520
<i>Running.</i>

08:42.420 --> 08:46.430
<i>As though he enjoyed the new 
experience more than he feared it.</i>

08:48.740 --> 08:50.760
Minori, Minori... Look at this!

08:51.450 --> 08:54.450
We still get our EXP pots!

08:55.830 --> 09:00.550
<i>Every day, we still receive the EXP 
pots we got as a beginner bonus.</i>

09:01.170 --> 09:05.720
<i>When Tohya learned that, it was 
natural that he'd want to see</i>

09:05.720 --> 09:07.270
<i>how it would work.</i>

09:09.170 --> 09:11.530
<i>Tohya had started to spur me</i>

09:11.530 --> 09:15.910
<i>into feeling up to moving forward a little bit...</i>

09:16.890 --> 09:17.840
<i>But...</i>

09:19.680 --> 09:21.200
They ran toward four o'clock!

09:21.200 --> 09:22.250
Stop them!

09:25.710 --> 09:26.450
Minori!

09:29.880 --> 09:30.990
Tohya!

09:30.990 --> 09:35.090
I told you that I wouldn't kill you if you 
dropped all your inventory items.

09:35.600 --> 09:37.390
Everything's so realistic...

09:37.760 --> 09:39.600
Is this really virtual?

09:40.150 --> 09:41.830
Well, a game's a game...

09:41.830 --> 09:43.370
Don't blame me.

09:43.370 --> 09:45.730
Y-You jerk!

09:53.890 --> 09:55.070
I'm alive?

09:57.780 --> 09:58.650
Minori!

10:00.840 --> 10:01.960
Tohya!

10:05.350 --> 10:09.140
<i>"In this world, if something matters, 
keep it in the bank."</i>

10:09.930 --> 10:13.000
<i>I only remembered Shiroe's words</i>

10:13.000 --> 10:15.670
<i>after I'd already lost everything.</i>

10:16.450 --> 10:17.510
<i>By that time,</i>

10:17.980 --> 10:21.830
<i>all that remained was the 
desire to rely on another.</i>

10:22.820 --> 10:25.080
What's with you guys?

10:25.080 --> 10:26.190
You newbies?

10:26.910 --> 10:28.520
No friends?

10:28.910 --> 10:30.520
That sucks for you.

10:31.770 --> 10:34.030
<i>I would have gone with anyone who offered aid,</i>

10:34.030 --> 10:35.610
<i>no matter who they were.</i>

10:39.480 --> 10:44.110
<i>The world around Shiroe is the 
one he's earned for himself.</i>

10:45.290 --> 10:49.840
<i>All I could do was to weep 
at my own powerlessness.</i>

10:51.000 --> 10:52.860
<i>The same way I always have.</i>

10:55.230 --> 10:58.000
<i>That's why I lost everything...</i>

11:02.150 --> 11:03.300
<i>That's why</i>

11:04.440 --> 11:09.270
<i>we don't have the right to be saved</i>

11:10.540 --> 11:11.510
<i>by Shiroe.</i>

11:18.990 --> 11:21.490
<b>Dragon's Nest</b>

11:19.660 --> 11:21.950
Oh, what have we here?

11:21.950 --> 11:26.490
Two beauties and the young 
master of Shopping Street 8.

11:28.040 --> 11:29.290
Hello!

11:29.290 --> 11:31.960
I'm Marielle, of the Crescent Moon Alliance!

11:31.960 --> 11:34.180
This is my head clerk...

11:34.180 --> 11:35.030
Hey!

11:35.030 --> 11:37.270
No one's had a head clerk for years.

11:37.810 --> 11:40.760
I'm Henrietta. Pleased to meet you.

11:41.380 --> 11:43.960
I'm in charge of our treasury.

11:44.800 --> 11:45.640
<i>Now, then...</i>

11:45.890 --> 11:48.670
<b>Michitaka 
Race/ Human 
Monk, Lv. 90 
Marine Agency</b>

11:46.180 --> 11:49.270
<i>Michitaka, leader of the Marine Agency.</i>

11:48.670 --> 11:53.260
<b>Roderic 
Race/ People of the Law 
Summoner, Lv. 90 
Roderic Merchant Guild</b>

11:49.650 --> 11:52.840
<i>Roderic, master of the Roderic Merchant Guild.</i>

11:53.750 --> 11:58.280
<i>I need to ensure negotiations with 
these two are successful.</i>

11:59.140 --> 12:01.780
<i>This is my battle.</i>

12:02.390 --> 12:05.780
<i>If I retreat here, I won't be 
able to face the others.</i>

12:07.900 --> 12:10.230
Before I get down to business,

12:10.230 --> 12:14.790
let me explain why I invited 
Shopping Street 8 here first.

12:15.220 --> 12:19.380
We've asked Shopping Street 8 
to provide ingredients for us.

12:19.670 --> 12:23.520
Hey, wait... Does that mean you're 
working with Shopping Street 8?

12:23.520 --> 12:27.640
No, then there would be no need to call us.

12:27.970 --> 12:29.790
You must want something else.

12:30.490 --> 12:31.770
<i>I see...</i>

12:32.540 --> 12:37.950
<i>Michitaka is a respected leader, 
but subtlety isn't his strength.</i>

12:38.430 --> 12:41.780
<i>Roderic appears similar to Shiroe,</i>

12:41.780 --> 12:44.530
<i>but he lacks Shiroe's guts.</i>

12:44.850 --> 12:47.260
Yes, that's right. It's something else.

12:47.610 --> 12:52.900
We'd like to extend the same 
offer to both of you.

12:55.680 --> 12:58.970
The only thing we can sell for 
the money we require

12:58.970 --> 13:02.610
is our new method of food preparation.

13:02.610 --> 13:04.590
Yes, but that's...

13:04.960 --> 13:05.820
Yes.

13:06.330 --> 13:10.770
Once they know how, using it is 
the simplest thing in the world.

13:11.450 --> 13:16.480
So, no matter what, we can't let them 
in on it until after the negotiations.

13:16.930 --> 13:20.180
Yes, but we can't go to them

13:20.180 --> 13:22.750
without telling them anything...

13:22.750 --> 13:26.110
That's one place where we have an advantage.

13:26.650 --> 13:28.120
An advantage?

13:28.590 --> 13:31.910
Our advantage is that they want profits.

13:33.000 --> 13:33.980
<i>Yes...</i>

13:34.640 --> 13:37.360
<i>Crescent Moon is tempting bait.</i>

13:38.120 --> 13:40.380
<i>As long as they desire to profit,</i>

13:41.410 --> 13:44.880
<i>we maintain the negotiating initiative.</i>

13:46.020 --> 13:49.510
We have the right to decide 
what information we reveal,

13:50.030 --> 13:53.810
as well as what we keep hidden.

13:54.510 --> 13:57.520
However, we cannot lie.

13:58.080 --> 14:02.360
But to dangle the bait, while trying 
to avoid telling them anything...

14:02.820 --> 14:06.860
If this is to work in the future, 
we can't afford to lie now.

14:07.630 --> 14:12.890
I'd better get Akatsuki for a whole week, 
or this won't be worth it at all!

14:14.870 --> 14:19.250
The Crescent Moon Alliance is 
embarking on a major operation.

14:19.710 --> 14:21.200
A major operation?

14:21.570 --> 14:25.430
You could think of it as a challenge.

14:26.050 --> 14:31.760
However, we lack the power to 
do it completely on our own.

14:32.140 --> 14:34.250
Then you want our help?

14:35.780 --> 14:38.810
I understand... A quest, is it?

14:40.630 --> 14:43.800
<i>Good, they misunderstood me.</i>

14:43.800 --> 14:46.780
<i>I'm not lying, Shiroe!</i>

14:47.170 --> 14:51.450
So, what kind of support 
would you need, Marie?

14:51.730 --> 14:54.240
Before I tell you what we need,

14:54.240 --> 14:57.330
let me explain how we've organized ourselves.

14:57.700 --> 15:00.580
Well, I'd like to hear your strategy, at least.

15:00.890 --> 15:01.900
Indeed.

15:02.410 --> 15:06.880
The man in charge of our 
major operation is Shiroe.

15:08.440 --> 15:10.590
The Villain in Glasses is doing this?

15:11.320 --> 15:12.600
<i>I knew it.</i>

15:13.190 --> 15:14.350
Griffons?

15:15.070 --> 15:18.680
That explains how you traveled to 
and from Susukino so quickly.

15:19.140 --> 15:22.900
Aren't those summon flutes a reward 
for a nigh-impossible raid?

15:23.280 --> 15:28.350
I can understand the Tea Party's 
strategist having one.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.910
Oh, so he's behind this.

15:32.380 --> 15:34.950
<i>He's more famous than I expected.</i>

15:35.410 --> 15:41.370
<i>Just their knowing that Shiroe is leading 
this operation lends weight to my words.</i>

15:42.080 --> 15:46.590
<i>The name "Villain in Glasses" isn't just for show.</i>

15:47.790 --> 15:49.580
Are you sick, my lord?

15:49.580 --> 15:52.670
Can you get sick in this world?

15:53.820 --> 15:59.270
Let's move on to the support we're 
requesting from each of you.

15:59.860 --> 16:03.370
To be blunt, we need money.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.260
I thought so.

16:05.260 --> 16:06.840
How much?

16:06.840 --> 16:09.030
At present, we need

16:10.420 --> 16:12.070
five million gold.

16:12.480 --> 16:13.220
Fi—

16:13.220 --> 16:14.330
Five million?

16:16.250 --> 16:20.790
I've never heard of any quest 
that costs that much money.

16:21.220 --> 16:22.480
Wait...

16:22.480 --> 16:24.600
Then The Novasphere Pioneers?

16:25.070 --> 16:28.330
With the expansion pack in place,

16:28.330 --> 16:32.180
it would make sense if there were 
new legendary-class quests.

16:32.690 --> 16:36.340
Which means the reward for that quest...

16:37.230 --> 16:41.180
<i>No matter what it is, it's likely 
to lead to lots of money.</i>

16:42.020 --> 16:44.040
<i>They want to believe that's true.</i>

16:44.550 --> 16:50.070
<i>And when someone wants to believe 
something is true, they usually will.</i>

16:53.810 --> 16:55.820
Try this! It's a new recipe.

16:56.380 --> 16:58.680
It's made from Roc eggs.

16:58.680 --> 17:00.210
It's sweet and delicious!

17:00.210 --> 17:01.580
Pudding?

17:02.970 --> 17:03.960
It's great!

17:04.630 --> 17:07.090
This is really Roc eggs?

17:07.090 --> 17:11.460
Rocs are level 85 and above...

17:12.250 --> 17:14.360
To cook these eggs,

17:14.360 --> 17:17.350
you'd need a recipe we don't know of, 
one that's above level 90.

17:17.540 --> 17:21.370
Naturally, we wouldn't give you 
nothing in return for the money.

17:21.370 --> 17:24.100
Once the operation is complete,

17:24.100 --> 17:27.360
we'll give all three of you full 
details about the plan.

17:28.110 --> 17:29.360
Also...

17:29.770 --> 17:32.740
We're prepared to ask a scribe to transcribe

17:32.740 --> 17:35.660
copies of all the cookbooks we're currently using,

17:35.660 --> 17:39.780
as well as the methods we've learned 
over the course of our challenge.

17:40.580 --> 17:42.140
Does that mean...

17:42.140 --> 17:45.590
The recipes Crescent Moon is using?

17:45.900 --> 17:48.750
Then there is a special recipe...

17:49.170 --> 17:52.520
<i>Looks like we're through the rough part.</i>

17:52.520 --> 17:54.730
<i>Now to throw them a life jacket.</i>

17:55.740 --> 17:59.640
Through asset liquidation and 
Crescent Moon's sales,

17:59.640 --> 18:01.970
we've collected 500,000 gold.

18:02.500 --> 18:08.230
But asking any single guild to provide 
the remaining 4.5 million

18:08.230 --> 18:11.050
would greatly alter the balance of power.

18:11.370 --> 18:17.530
So why don't we have each guild 
contribute 1.5 million?

18:17.940 --> 18:20.490
That represents around a 
hundred people's assets...

18:21.310 --> 18:23.870
The Roderic Merchant Guild 
agrees to your proposal.

18:24.290 --> 18:25.200
Same here!

18:25.200 --> 18:26.830
Shopping Street 8 does, too!

18:26.830 --> 18:28.170
Got it!

18:28.170 --> 18:30.840
The Marine Agency will provide the funds.

18:31.270 --> 18:35.550
If you prefer, we could be your sole sponsor.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.370
That's no fair!

18:37.370 --> 18:39.600
I won't allow you to take all 
the profit for yourself!

18:40.030 --> 18:43.260
Let's be civil, everyone... For me, okay?

18:47.680 --> 18:49.370
Hear from him again?

18:51.220 --> 18:52.320
From Shiroe.

18:52.320 --> 18:53.510
Shh!

18:54.780 --> 18:55.770
Listen...

18:56.960 --> 18:58.380
I didn't tell you,

18:58.840 --> 19:00.850
but I saw him once earlier.

19:02.820 --> 19:05.910
But I couldn't ask him for help.

19:06.910 --> 19:07.750
Why not?

19:08.600 --> 19:09.720
I don't know.

19:10.660 --> 19:12.770
He's so cool, so kind...

19:12.770 --> 19:14.000
He knows everything.

19:15.230 --> 19:16.720
He's just so amazing.

19:17.410 --> 19:18.260
So...

19:19.590 --> 19:20.220
<i>Yeah.</i>

19:21.110 --> 19:26.510
<i>We have no right to ask someone 
like him to save us.</i>

19:27.100 --> 19:29.510
Do you think I could be like him?

19:31.930 --> 19:35.200
Right now, I couldn't ask him to save me...

19:36.240 --> 19:40.410
But if I could be like him...

19:46.480 --> 19:47.660
I'm done for.

19:47.660 --> 19:50.420
It feels like my HP and MP are at zero...

19:50.960 --> 19:52.680
I suddenly feel so exhausted.

19:53.550 --> 19:54.920
This smell...

19:55.380 --> 19:56.870
Akatsuki!

19:56.870 --> 19:59.510
You aren't smelling me. 
That's the dessert.

19:59.510 --> 20:02.270
When you're tired, sweets are the best!

20:02.270 --> 20:03.400
Meow.

20:05.220 --> 20:06.500
Thanks...

20:06.500 --> 20:07.970
You all had a tough time, too.

20:07.970 --> 20:09.120
Thank you!

20:09.500 --> 20:11.420
Shiro asked us to.

20:11.420 --> 20:14.220
He said you'd be tired when you got back.

20:14.220 --> 20:15.570
He did?

20:16.030 --> 20:17.530
Where is he, anyway?

20:17.830 --> 20:19.360
I should tell him how it went.

20:19.630 --> 20:23.260
He's already working on the next job.

20:23.260 --> 20:27.870
He was certain you'd be able to pull it off.

20:30.590 --> 20:35.380
It feels like he planned for everything.

20:36.020 --> 20:39.560
There's no beating the Villain in Glasses.

20:44.290 --> 20:46.600
We're splitting up for tonight's sparring match.

20:46.600 --> 20:48.060
Okay!

20:48.830 --> 20:52.190
What has the Crescent Moon 
Alliance invited us to?

20:52.640 --> 20:55.260
They said they wanted to talk 
about the city of Akihabara,

20:55.260 --> 20:57.150
but the details were vague.

20:57.750 --> 21:01.150
She once tried and failed to make an alliance

21:01.150 --> 21:03.060
of smaller guilds, but...

21:03.960 --> 21:06.050
I don't know if they're true,

21:06.050 --> 21:08.660
but the stories about the guy 
working with her bother me.

21:09.350 --> 21:12.900
You mean Log Horizon?

21:13.360 --> 21:14.170
Yes...

21:15.240 --> 21:17.910
It's Shiroe, from the Tea Party.

21:18.290 --> 21:22.800
<b>We humbly request your presence 
at a meeting to determine 
Akihabara's future. 

Crescent Moon Alliance 
Guild Master Marielle 
Log Horizon 
Guild Master Shiroe</b>

21:19.120 --> 21:22.800
Then does this mean the next 
raid is canceled, my lord?

21:23.070 --> 21:23.750
Yes...

21:24.160 --> 21:26.370
Unfortunately, the dates overlap.

21:26.950 --> 21:29.310
Is this conference that important?

21:29.860 --> 21:32.080
I'm less interested in the conference itself

21:33.180 --> 21:35.230
than in the one holding it.

21:41.140 --> 21:43.110
I'm doing it tomorrow.

21:44.660 --> 21:48.150
I promised I'd come and save you, right?

21:48.580 --> 21:52.080
<b>Shiroe</b>

21:49.270 --> 21:51.630
So that's okay, right?

21:54.840 --> 21:58.970
<i>Tohya said he wanted to be like Shiroe.</i>

21:59.990 --> 22:03.470
<i>He wants to open new paths, like Shiroe.</i>

22:04.940 --> 22:07.970
<i>That is what he wants!</i>

22:11.030 --> 22:12.320
<i>And I do, too.</i>

22:26.880 --> 22:28.850
It's time, Shiro.

22:29.120 --> 22:29.790
Yes.

22:30.350 --> 22:31.490
Now it's my turn...

22:33.640 --> 22:34.630
to fight.

24:05.880 --> 24:09.260
At the guild building, twelve masters gather.

24:09.260 --> 24:12.050
The battle begins, as Shiroe fights weaponless.

24:12.610 --> 24:15.970
And the new players trapped by Hamelin,

24:15.970 --> 24:19.530
Minori and Tohya, are about 
to begin their fight, as well.

24:19.910 --> 24:22.170
To open the door to hope...

24:22.480 --> 24:29.990
<b>Round Table Conference</b>

24:22.860 --> 24:24.700
Next time: Round Table Conference.

24:25.410 --> 24:27.250
This is our reality.
