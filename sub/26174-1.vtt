00:15.014 --> 00:17.517
- [Wil] My name is Wil Hunter.

00:17.517 --> 00:20.754
This is my twin brother Orrie.

00:20.754 --> 00:24.591
Having a twin can be,
well, a pain in the ass.

00:26.426 --> 00:30.597
But it's also great knowing
 someone always has your back.

00:31.898 --> 00:34.134
Orrie's into making movies.

00:37.737 --> 00:38.571
Me?

00:39.839 --> 00:41.941
I like to paint and draw.

01:13.273 --> 01:14.674
- [Simon] Get the boys in it.

01:14.674 --> 01:17.010
- Yay, they did it!

01:17.010 --> 01:18.645
- [Wil] After college,
 my dad wanted me to

01:18.645 --> 01:21.448
move home and help run the
  family storage business.

01:21.448 --> 01:23.316
- Your future's in storage.

01:23.316 --> 01:25.085
- [Wil] So he could
 realize his dream to

01:25.085 --> 01:28.822
build a plane and fly
  like the Wright Brothers.

01:28.822 --> 01:31.391
But I wanted to make
 it as a painter.

01:31.391 --> 01:36.196
So with the urging of my
  girlfriend, I went for it.

01:36.196 --> 01:38.965
She and I moved
  to New York City.

01:40.867 --> 01:43.770
And I tried to make it
 as a gallery artist.

01:43.770 --> 01:45.338
- Thank you for
 showing me your work.

01:45.338 --> 01:47.073
It's just not for me.

01:47.073 --> 01:49.509
- [Wil] That didn't work out.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.379
(snickering)

01:55.849 --> 01:59.686
So now I'm just taking
life one day at a time.

02:03.890 --> 02:05.892
Yeah, that's not a problem.

02:05.892 --> 02:07.894
All right, thanks so
 much, have a good day.

02:07.894 --> 02:09.095
Hey Weezy, I don't think we have

02:09.095 --> 02:12.765
any mulch left, can you
check the back shed?

02:17.804 --> 02:18.638
Susan?

02:20.140 --> 02:22.809
Hey, what are you doing here?

02:22.809 --> 02:23.643
- Hi.

02:24.844 --> 02:27.013
I thought you went
  to Charleston.

02:27.013 --> 02:29.816
- Yeah, that fell through, so
 I'm back here working for dad.

02:29.816 --> 02:32.986
- Give me a hug,
 it's good to see you.

02:36.256 --> 02:37.924
Right, sorry.

02:37.924 --> 02:39.325
I need to get into
  my mom's unit,

02:39.325 --> 02:41.494
but she can't find her key.

02:41.494 --> 02:44.330
- So how's everything
 with Lucian?

02:45.298 --> 02:47.700
- Oh it didn't work out.

02:47.700 --> 02:50.570
Anyway, my mom asked me to
  come help with her arches.

02:50.570 --> 02:52.705
She's been kinda sick.

02:52.705 --> 02:53.940
The gallery scene is really slow

02:53.940 --> 02:55.441
in New York in
  the summer anyway.

02:55.441 --> 02:56.976
- Sorry to hear
 she's not doing well.

02:56.976 --> 02:58.177
I forgot she ran those things.

02:58.177 --> 02:59.846
- Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

02:59.846 --> 03:00.980
She's gonna be fine,
 I think she just

03:00.980 --> 03:03.650
needs some time to take it easy.

03:09.455 --> 03:11.558
(shrieks and laughs)

03:11.558 --> 03:12.992
- Got it.

03:12.992 --> 03:13.826
All right.

03:21.801 --> 03:22.802
Here you go.

03:28.808 --> 03:30.243
Need a hand?

03:30.243 --> 03:31.778

Whoa, that's beautiful.

Wow.

Yeah, your colors and the
  lines are really bold.

04:29.569 --> 04:30.403
It's good.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.041
You should do this
 art show this weekend.

04:35.041 --> 04:36.309
- No--

04:36.309 --> 04:38.411
- It's gonna be a
  great opportunity.

04:38.411 --> 04:41.814
It's a chance for us
 to reconnect and...

04:41.814 --> 04:44.050
I don't know, I missed you.

04:46.653 --> 04:48.321
- I don't think so, Susan.

04:48.321 --> 04:50.690
- Look, I have to say this.

04:50.690 --> 04:54.627
I'm sorry for how things
went down in New York.

04:57.697 --> 04:58.531
- Wow.

05:00.366 --> 05:01.334
You're back.

That gallery owner cheat on you

05:04.170 --> 05:06.673
with the younger, blonder model?

05:06.673 --> 05:09.075
That what happened?

05:09.075 --> 05:11.110
- Just think about it.

05:11.110 --> 05:11.944
- Sure.

05:13.379 --> 05:17.316
- Couldn't have been blonder
though, that hair is like pfft.

05:17.316 --> 05:18.951
What's Jabba the
Slut doing here?

05:18.951 --> 05:20.186
- She wants me to show my art

05:20.186 --> 05:22.722
at some art show this weekend.

05:22.722 --> 05:23.823
I don't know.

05:27.894 --> 05:29.462
- You should do it.

05:30.897 --> 05:33.199
Did I miss the part where you
 told dad we were doing this?

05:33.199 --> 05:36.269
- I was going to, and then
  just didn't find the time.

05:36.269 --> 05:37.770
- Hey!

05:37.770 --> 05:40.239
Good God, you boys scared
  the shit out of me.

05:40.239 --> 05:41.708
- Yeah, the feeling's mutual.

05:41.708 --> 05:42.942
- What are you all
  doing out here?

05:42.942 --> 05:44.310
I thought someone was
trying to steal the van.

05:44.310 --> 05:46.612
- Okay, Weezy, just do
 us a solid and please

05:46.612 --> 05:48.715
don't tell dad that
we're borrowing the van.

05:48.715 --> 05:50.283
We'll have it back
before he even notices.

05:50.283 --> 05:54.387
- I'll lie to my girlfriend,
 but not the king.

05:54.387 --> 05:56.055
Look, no promises, just get it

05:56.055 --> 05:57.523
back here as quick as you can.

05:57.523 --> 06:00.093

06:01.961 --> 06:05.865
(upbeat acoustic guitar music)

06:11.537 --> 06:14.107
Will you hit that GoPro for me?

06:17.677 --> 06:20.947
Starkly Gardens, day
 one, let's get it!

06:22.348 --> 06:23.850
Aw hello, grandma.

06:25.251 --> 06:28.388

  hair, is that pumpkin?

06:28.388 --> 06:29.622
Goldfish?

06:29.622 --> 06:30.656
- Be nice, all right?

06:30.656 --> 06:31.624
These are my colleagues.

06:31.624 --> 06:33.760
- This is your competition, Wil.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.328
They need to be vanquished.

06:35.328 --> 06:38.998
- Yeah, I'm not
 vanquishing anybody.

06:38.998 --> 06:42.502
- All right, let's
 get some soundbites.

06:42.502 --> 06:43.836
How do you feel?

06:45.538 --> 06:46.773
- Good.

06:46.773 --> 06:48.007
Good.

06:48.007 --> 06:49.375
- Wil, don't do
  this, don't do the

06:49.375 --> 06:52.078
oyster thing all right,
I need you to open up.

06:52.078 --> 06:55.214
Let's hear some bold statements.

06:55.214 --> 06:57.417
- Bold statements.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.417
- [Orrie] You know
  I can edit this

06:58.417 --> 06:59.585
to make you look
like an asshole.

06:59.585 --> 07:01.154
- Okay, okay, calm down.

07:01.154 --> 07:04.090
Dude, I'm nervous, all right?

07:04.090 --> 07:07.293
I don't know how people are
 gonna like my paintings.

07:07.293 --> 07:08.528
What if they don't like them?

07:08.528 --> 07:10.163
What if I don't sell
 enough paintings?

07:10.163 --> 07:12.498
What if I get there and...

07:12.498 --> 07:13.499
- [Orrie] She looks pissed.

07:13.499 --> 07:14.333
- [Wil] Shit.

07:14.333 --> 07:15.168
- You're late!

07:15.168 --> 07:16.302
- Yeah, I know.

07:16.302 --> 07:17.870
I'm sorry.

07:17.870 --> 07:19.639
- You were supposed to
 be here an hour ago.

07:19.639 --> 07:20.907
- Sorry, we got, we--

07:20.907 --> 07:23.009
- [Orrie] There was
 an accident on 64th.

07:23.009 --> 07:24.277
A bad one.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.279
- Yeah, accidents and
 you, what a surprise.

07:26.279 --> 07:29.048
Okay, do you have
  your booth fee?

07:31.517 --> 07:35.154
- Can I write you
  a check tomorrow?

07:35.154 --> 07:36.789
- Fine.

07:36.789 --> 07:38.758
Oh my God, tell me
  you have a tent.

07:38.758 --> 07:39.592
- Why?

07:39.592 --> 07:41.294
It's a beautiful day.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.562
- With a 30% chance of rain.

07:42.562 --> 07:43.462
(text ding)

07:43.462 --> 07:44.463
Oh shit, 40.

07:45.631 --> 07:47.166
Orrie, you can't film here.

07:47.166 --> 07:48.801
- That's just hurting Wil.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.436
'Cause this is his documentary.

07:50.436 --> 07:54.373
A conflicted artist trying
  to fulfill his potential.

07:54.373 --> 07:55.942
Plus, Susan, this
 actually helps you.

07:55.942 --> 07:58.077
You see, no one has
 done a behind the

07:58.077 --> 08:00.546
scenes documentary of
 an art show before.

08:00.546 --> 08:01.347
- No!

08:02.482 --> 08:03.683
- Do I need to remind you that

08:03.683 --> 08:05.184
I'm an award winning filmmaker?

08:05.184 --> 08:06.719
- Oh really?

08:06.719 --> 08:08.221
What happened to the horror
 surf movie you were making?

08:08.221 --> 08:09.789
- Cowabunga Corpse?

08:11.190 --> 08:12.925
I will admit that surfing
  in zombie costumes was

08:12.925 --> 08:15.461
harder than I had anticipated,
 but it was a good script.

08:15.461 --> 08:16.662
- Okay look, if he doesn't film

08:16.662 --> 08:18.798
he's just gonna get
 in more trouble.

08:18.798 --> 08:20.199
- Fine, okay.

08:20.199 --> 08:22.268
Do not disturb the
  artists or the customers.

08:22.268 --> 08:23.269
Do you copy?

08:25.838 --> 08:27.240
- Yes.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.774
- Great, okay, I
 have a billion things

08:28.774 --> 08:30.476
to take care of before
 this thing starts.

08:30.476 --> 08:34.647
Can you unload and set up
  and get this out of here?

08:42.321 --> 08:45.258
- I think we need to
 set up, so come on.

08:45.258 --> 08:48.094
(soft rock music)

09:00.640 --> 09:01.874

09:01.874 --> 09:03.209

09:04.343 --> 09:06.412

This should be interesting.

09:20.626 --> 09:21.460
What?

09:21.460 --> 09:22.628
- Nothing.

09:22.628 --> 09:25.031

 be interesting.

Paintings right?

11:12.705 --> 11:14.206
- Yes, yeah.

11:14.206 --> 11:15.808
- So you need to
  get your walls up.

  best piece in the

 so much for helping.

- Yeah, I'm not helping
  you, I'm helping the show.

11:24.784 --> 11:26.352

 can walk through here

 it's a garage sale.

- No, what are you doing?

11:31.590 --> 11:32.425
- A closeup.

11:35.928 --> 11:37.129
Good luck, you're gonna need it.

11:37.129 --> 11:38.831
- I can keep him on a leash!

11:38.831 --> 11:41.367
- More like a muzzle.

11:41.367 --> 11:42.468
- I like her.

11:45.471 --> 11:46.305
Oooh.

11:47.306 --> 11:48.140
- What?

11:48.140 --> 11:48.974
- You like her too.

11:48.974 --> 11:49.809
- Wow.

11:49.809 --> 11:50.976
- In a different way.

11:50.976 --> 11:51.944
- You really are
annoying, you know that?

11:51.944 --> 11:52.912
- Oh come on man, it's cute.

11:52.912 --> 11:54.213
You got the puppy dog eyes--

11:54.213 --> 11:55.781
- All right boys,
  this ship sails at

11:55.781 --> 11:58.250
ten hundred and this space
  needs to be squared away.

11:58.250 --> 12:01.020
You, put the camera down
and pick up a panel.

12:01.020 --> 12:01.954
Let's go!

12:01.954 --> 12:02.788
- Yup.

12:02.788 --> 12:03.622
- Yes sir.

12:04.957 --> 12:06.158
- [Wil] This one.

12:06.158 --> 12:09.028
Over here, she said
 one in the back.

12:09.028 --> 12:10.863
- I can't get this
  one alone, Wil!

12:10.863 --> 12:11.764
- All right, got you.

12:11.764 --> 12:12.865
You got this?

12:17.470 --> 12:20.406
- Oh great, you're set up.

12:20.406 --> 12:21.974
- Yeah.

12:21.974 --> 12:24.243
Chief and Rachel helped me.

12:24.243 --> 12:25.277
They seem nice.

12:25.277 --> 12:26.479
- Yeah, they're nice.

12:26.479 --> 12:28.147
Just like their art.

12:29.381 --> 12:32.084
- What's that supposed to mean?

12:32.084 --> 12:35.020
- I think it's obvious
  it's not gallery material.

12:35.020 --> 12:37.623
This is why you and
 I belong in the city.

12:37.623 --> 12:40.459
Five minutes people,
 five minutes!

12:45.931 --> 12:49.835
- She ever scream at
 you like that in bed?

12:49.835 --> 12:51.036
Five minutes, Wil!

12:51.036 --> 12:52.138
You have five minutes!

12:52.138 --> 12:53.305

14:13.719 --> 14:16.021

 Weezy keeps texting

 avoiding his calls

14:20.059 --> 14:21.961

15:30.529 --> 15:31.530
What's this?

15:32.698 --> 15:33.666
- Do you always

15:33.666 --> 15:36.035
things that don't belong to you?

15:36.035 --> 15:37.303

15:37.303 --> 15:38.137
Come on.

15:38.137 --> 15:39.204
Bingo.

15:39.204 --> 15:40.472
- Art Show Bingo.

15:40.472 --> 15:42.541
It's a tradition around here.

15:42.541 --> 15:46.111
We get different cards
 for different shows.

15:48.914 --> 15:51.750
It just keeps
 things interesting.

15:51.750 --> 15:54.053
- Let's see, browser
 destroys art.

15:54.053 --> 15:55.754
Is that your best price?

15:55.754 --> 15:57.289
You're kidding me,
  people try and negotiate?

15:57.289 --> 16:00.693
- This ain't Fifth
  Avenue, rookie.

16:00.693 --> 16:02.528
- Patron leaves trash.

16:02.528 --> 16:04.196
My kid could do
  better than that?

16:04.196 --> 16:05.831
You're joking me, people
actually say that?

16:05.831 --> 16:06.665
- Yeah.

16:08.467 --> 16:09.702
See this one?

16:09.702 --> 16:11.637
Newbie's first sale.

16:11.637 --> 16:14.273
I've got my eye on you.

16:14.273 --> 16:15.107
- Really?

16:16.809 --> 16:17.643
- For Bingo.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.144
- Yeah, of course.

16:20.479 --> 16:22.481
So what happens when you win?

16:22.481 --> 16:24.983
- They have to buy the first
 round of drinks that night.

16:24.983 --> 16:26.819
- Wait, so the winner of all

16:26.819 --> 16:29.088
this has to buy
  the first rounds?

16:29.088 --> 16:30.756
- Yeah, it's ironic.

16:33.592 --> 16:35.127
- Artists hook up.

16:35.127 --> 16:37.229
- Been there done that, trust
 me, it is not a pretty sight.

16:37.229 --> 16:38.564
- Depends on who's filming it.

16:38.564 --> 16:40.232
- Not even.

16:40.232 --> 16:41.934
- Bow chica wah wah!

16:43.035 --> 16:44.503
- Does he always do that?

16:44.503 --> 16:46.705
I mean like perfect timing,
 just be so annoying.

16:46.705 --> 16:49.208
- He tends to have that, yeah.

16:50.576 --> 16:54.113
So if it's all so terrible,
 then why even bother?

16:54.113 --> 16:55.748
- I don't know.

16:55.748 --> 16:58.050
I like the other artists
and the rhythm of it.

16:58.050 --> 17:00.152
To me, that's part
 of being an artist.

17:00.152 --> 17:01.820
Create, show, repeat.

17:02.821 --> 17:04.323
It's not a living.

17:05.190 --> 17:06.358
It's life.

17:06.358 --> 17:07.593
- Oh that's a great tagline.

17:07.593 --> 17:08.827
- If you don't stop
 recoding me, I'm gonna

17:08.827 --> 17:11.195
take that camera and
 shove it up your ass.

17:11.195 --> 17:12.397
- Okay.

17:12.397 --> 17:13.598
- We're going,
  come on, let's go.

17:13.598 --> 17:15.067
- Wait wait wait wait!

17:15.067 --> 17:16.435
I paid $3 for this.

17:16.435 --> 17:17.368
- Okay, grab it.

17:17.368 --> 17:18.637
- [Rachel] Can you just get out?

17:18.637 --> 17:20.005
- Yeah, I really
  do love your art.

17:20.005 --> 17:20.939
- I do too.

17:20.939 --> 17:21.773
- Shut up.

17:35.788 --> 17:39.958
(upbeat synthesizer
 and violin music)

18:25.003 --> 18:27.506
- [Mother] Come on, let's
  go look at some artwork.

18:27.506 --> 18:30.175
What happened to your ice cream?

18:34.513 --> 18:36.281
(bell rings)

18:36.281 --> 18:37.549
- [Chief] Thank you very much.

18:37.549 --> 18:39.451
- Hey Chief, what's
 up with the bell?

18:39.451 --> 18:41.520
- I ring it every
 time I make a sale.

18:41.520 --> 18:43.188
Keeps the energy up.

18:43.188 --> 18:44.623
- I like it.

18:44.623 --> 18:46.558
- When you make your first
sale, I'll let you ring it too.

18:46.558 --> 18:48.227
- All right, thanks.

18:55.734 --> 18:58.403
(thunder booms)

19:25.464 --> 19:26.965
Oracle or asshole?

19:33.305 --> 19:34.973
- Asshole.
  - Asshole.

19:36.175 --> 19:39.478
- This is definitely
 going in the movie.

19:43.582 --> 19:47.519
(gentle acoustic guitar music)

19:58.664 --> 19:59.765
- Hi.

19:59.765 --> 20:01.366
- Hi, are you the artist?

20:01.366 --> 20:02.200
- Yes.

20:02.200 --> 20:03.235
Wil Hunter.

20:03.235 --> 20:04.336
- These are amazing.

20:04.336 --> 20:05.804
- They really are.

20:05.804 --> 20:07.139
- Thank you.

20:07.139 --> 20:08.373
- I'm sure you get this all the

20:08.373 --> 20:11.510
time, but what's
  your inspiration?

20:11.510 --> 20:13.512
- Actually you're
  the first to ask.

20:13.512 --> 20:15.747
My real job is running
a self-storage facility.

20:15.747 --> 20:16.982
- Oh.

20:16.982 --> 20:18.317
- Actually I find
 it really inspiring.

20:18.317 --> 20:19.451
- Really?

20:19.451 --> 20:20.652
- Sure.

20:20.652 --> 20:22.888
You've got all these
 people that are

20:22.888 --> 20:24.656
storing their stuff, so you have

20:24.656 --> 20:27.526
the physical stuff,
 but you also have

20:27.526 --> 20:30.929
the dreams and fears
 and disappointments.

20:32.030 --> 20:34.533
All of it just
 goes inside a small

20:34.533 --> 20:38.036
unit that kinda feels
 like a canvas to me.

20:38.036 --> 20:39.605
- [Male Customer] How much?

20:39.605 --> 20:41.173
- For this one 400.

20:42.374 --> 20:43.842
- [Male Customer] We'll take it.

20:43.842 --> 20:44.676
- Really?

20:46.178 --> 20:47.980
I mean great.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.982
I'll wrap it up
 and have it waiting

20:49.982 --> 20:53.552
for you when you're
done enjoying the show.

20:59.791 --> 21:00.592
- Yeah!

21:00.592 --> 21:01.426
Aw yeah!

21:01.426 --> 21:02.227
- Come on!

21:02.227 --> 21:03.695

21:56.615 --> 22:00.485
- Well it was either this
  or a princess castle.

22:01.653 --> 22:03.722
They didn't have
  a lot of options.

22:03.722 --> 22:05.357
- Look, I've been getting a lot

22:05.357 --> 22:07.926
of complaints about Orrie.

22:07.926 --> 22:09.294
If he's going to be here I need

22:09.294 --> 22:10.962
you to straighten him out now.

22:10.962 --> 22:14.099
- I've been trying
  to do that for...

22:14.099 --> 22:14.933
25 years.

22:16.334 --> 22:17.169
Okay.

22:18.603 --> 22:21.940
- Hey, I really want you to
 do the show next weekend.

22:21.940 --> 22:25.043
- Susan, I just don't think I'm

22:25.043 --> 22:26.978
cut out for this sort of thing.

22:26.978 --> 22:28.180
- What?

22:28.180 --> 22:29.314
I've been getting a ton of great

22:29.314 --> 22:31.983
feedback about you and your art.

22:34.186 --> 22:35.020
- My art?

22:36.421 --> 22:37.422
- It's good.

22:45.630 --> 22:47.566
- Sir, I promise, we
 have rodent traps,

22:47.566 --> 22:50.001
we have an exterminator
that comes once a month.

22:50.001 --> 22:51.603
We will take all
  of your items and

22:51.603 --> 22:53.171
put them in a unit
  on the other side

22:53.171 --> 22:56.208
of the facility where
 they'll be safe.

22:56.208 --> 22:59.811
Again, I'm very sorry, we'll
 get this taken care of.

22:59.811 --> 23:03.315
Weezy, let's get the van
 and let's get this cracking.

23:03.315 --> 23:04.716
- I'm sorry, the van's not here

23:04.716 --> 23:07.052
right now, I'll explain later.

23:07.052 --> 23:10.989
I'll get the car, we'll
get this taken care of.

23:18.630 --> 23:19.564
- The artist.

23:19.564 --> 23:21.299
- I'm so sorry sir, come on.

23:21.299 --> 23:24.002
Can you not get through a
 single day without being...

23:24.002 --> 23:24.836
- Provocative?

23:24.836 --> 23:26.071
- Annoying.

23:26.071 --> 23:27.038
- It's not annoying,
 Wil, it's provocative.

23:27.038 --> 23:29.107
Great art is provocative.

23:37.449 --> 23:38.250
Wow.

23:39.751 --> 23:40.585
Like this.

23:41.553 --> 23:43.522
- This guy's the real deal huh?

23:43.522 --> 23:46.525
- Take a picture,
  It'll last longer!

23:47.993 --> 23:50.095
It's a figure of
speech, dumbass!

23:50.095 --> 23:51.429
Now move, move,
 get out of the way,

23:51.429 --> 23:52.964
you're blocking
  paying customers.

23:52.964 --> 23:54.533
- Great art from
  a terrible human.

23:54.533 --> 23:56.468
- Dude, did you see all
the red dots in there?

23:56.468 --> 23:57.702
I'm starting to have second

23:57.702 --> 23:59.171
thoughts about
  this entire thing.

23:59.171 --> 24:01.239
- Hey man, look, I'm
  struggling too, all right?

24:01.239 --> 24:03.074
I have all this great
 footage and I have no hook.

24:03.074 --> 24:05.243
I have nothing to tie
 all of it together.

24:05.243 --> 24:06.711
It's all so random.

24:06.711 --> 24:07.979
And have you seen these artists?

24:07.979 --> 24:09.214
There's a guy in
  a tent over there

24:09.214 --> 24:12.584
who just sits there
 and paints his navel.

24:12.584 --> 24:16.288
- He paints his actual navel,
 or pictures of his navel?

24:16.288 --> 24:17.889
- It's pictures of.

24:18.723 --> 24:20.125
- Still weird.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.259
- Yeah.

24:21.259 --> 24:23.428
And apparently profitable.

24:27.799 --> 24:29.501
- First show is
 always the hardest.

24:29.501 --> 24:31.369
Don't worry, you're gonna
  be a pro by the next one.

24:31.369 --> 24:34.606
- Yeah, I'm not so sure
 there's gonna be a next one.

24:34.606 --> 24:36.575
- Well then you have to come
 to the after party tonight.

24:36.575 --> 24:39.644
Chief got Bingo, so he's buying.

24:39.644 --> 24:41.513
- Yeah, sounds great.

24:41.513 --> 24:43.181
- You can bring your girlfriend.

24:43.181 --> 24:44.049
What's her name?

24:44.049 --> 24:45.283
- Susan.

24:45.283 --> 24:47.085
Yeah, no, she's
  not my girlfriend.

24:47.085 --> 24:48.220
- Oh.

24:48.220 --> 24:49.454
- She was.

24:49.454 --> 24:52.157
- [Rachel] It just
  didn't work out.

24:53.892 --> 24:55.293
- I promised my dad
 I would take over

24:55.293 --> 24:56.828
the family business,
 and I actually

24:56.828 --> 24:58.864
really like running
it, don't get me wrong,

24:58.864 --> 25:03.301
but I mean I like my
paintings too, you know?

25:03.301 --> 25:05.203
He just doesn't get it.

25:07.272 --> 25:09.341
- Is your dad about
 six foot, salt and

25:09.341 --> 25:12.711
pepper hair, gray
  at the temples?

25:12.711 --> 25:13.645
Named Simon?

25:13.645 --> 25:15.780
- Okay, how would you even...

25:15.780 --> 25:17.015
Are you psychic?

25:17.015 --> 25:19.217
- Yes, would you like
 to know your future?

25:19.217 --> 25:20.819
- I'm good.

25:20.819 --> 25:24.556
- No, I think he's
  arguing with your brother.

25:28.326 --> 25:29.661
- Yeah, that would be him.

25:29.661 --> 25:30.495
Would you excuse me?

25:30.495 --> 25:31.329
- Yeah.

25:33.431 --> 25:35.934
- Hey, dad, what
 are you doing here?

25:35.934 --> 25:38.670
- Did you ignore
Weezy yesterday?

25:38.670 --> 25:40.238
We had an irate customer.

25:40.238 --> 25:41.740
Am I doing your job now?

25:41.740 --> 25:42.974
- It completely slipped my mind,

25:42.974 --> 25:45.477
I just got caught
 up here, I'm sorry.

25:45.477 --> 25:48.480
- I thought we had
  this locked down.

25:48.480 --> 25:50.148
I'm retiring soon.

25:50.148 --> 25:51.616
I have my own dreams and you

25:51.616 --> 25:54.386
boys are not gonna foul that up.

25:54.386 --> 25:59.224
Are you gonna turn your back
 on running The Storage King?

25:59.224 --> 26:00.058
For this?

26:07.432 --> 26:10.268
(soft rock music)

26:17.475 --> 26:19.611
- Hey, you see that?

26:19.611 --> 26:22.047
My kid could've painted that.

26:26.084 --> 26:30.021
(gentle acoustic guitar music)

26:35.060 --> 26:37.729
(crowd chatter)

26:40.031 --> 26:41.666
- Everybody, this is Wil.

26:41.666 --> 26:43.268
Wil, this is everybody.

26:43.268 --> 26:45.236
Welcome to the Chief's chariot.

26:45.236 --> 26:46.404
- [Female Artist]
  What's up, Wil?

26:46.404 --> 26:48.873
- [Second Female
Artist] What's up, Wil?

26:48.873 --> 26:50.442
Say Wil, you want a cold one?

26:50.442 --> 26:51.509
- Yeah, sure.

26:56.414 --> 26:59.117
- She had the nerve to
  ask me for a better price.

26:59.117 --> 27:00.352
You know what I told her?

27:00.352 --> 27:01.286
Sure you can have
  a better price.

27:01.286 --> 27:03.588
It just went up 25%.

27:03.588 --> 27:05.056
(laughter)

27:05.056 --> 27:09.194
- [Vic] Bunch of pricks,
 it's not a damn flea market.

27:10.829 --> 27:12.197
- Glad you came.

27:12.197 --> 27:13.465
- Yeah, me too.

27:17.435 --> 27:20.839
- All right, hey everybody,
 quit your bitching all right?

27:20.839 --> 27:25.110
Look, every day we come here
 and we see the same thing.

27:25.110 --> 27:26.711
Okay?

27:26.711 --> 27:30.248
You got the browsers,
 the bargain hunters,
 the dog walkers.

27:31.916 --> 27:36.087
But every so often you get that
buyer who really needs you.

27:37.455 --> 27:39.157
Who needs that piece of you to

27:39.157 --> 27:41.493
take home and hang
  it on their wall.

27:41.493 --> 27:45.196
It could be a million dollar
 mansion, or just some dump.

27:45.196 --> 27:47.298
But it doesn't matter.

27:47.298 --> 27:49.100
It doesn't matter
 because those moments,

27:49.100 --> 27:51.503
they don't come
 around all the time.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.104
But when they do...

27:54.706 --> 27:56.508
It's like a high.

27:56.508 --> 27:59.644
It's like, what do
  they call it Zoey?

27:59.644 --> 28:01.179
Chasing the dragon?

28:01.179 --> 28:02.213
- You should know, Vic.

28:02.213 --> 28:03.448
- That's right, I do know.

28:03.448 --> 28:05.417
I do know, it's chasing
the dragon, guys!

28:05.417 --> 28:06.918
That's what's we're looking
 for, we're all looking

28:06.918 --> 28:10.522
for the perfect high, the
  million dollar jackpot!

28:10.522 --> 28:12.057
The hooker that--

28:12.057 --> 28:15.660
- Yeah yeah yeah yeah, we get
 it, we get it Vic, we get it.

28:17.462 --> 28:19.230
- To chasing the dragon.

28:19.230 --> 28:20.832
- Chasing the dragon!

28:20.832 --> 28:23.068
(cheering)

28:33.078 --> 28:36.781
- Are they always
 this inspirational?

28:36.781 --> 28:38.416
- I think that's
  the beer talking.

28:38.416 --> 28:39.651
(laughter)

28:39.651 --> 28:40.852
I don't know, it's
  just what we do

28:40.852 --> 28:43.154
to blow off some
 steam after a show.

28:43.154 --> 28:45.256
- I'm starting to get it.

28:48.059 --> 28:50.328
Where'd you get your necklace?

28:50.328 --> 28:53.731
- I actually got this from
 an artist at a New York show.

28:53.731 --> 28:55.834
I just thought it
  was so beautiful

28:55.834 --> 28:58.937
that she collected
  these lost objects

29:00.605 --> 29:03.575
and found places
 for them to belong.

29:06.177 --> 29:08.646
(phone text dings)

29:08.646 --> 29:09.948
- [Wil] Sorry.

29:09.948 --> 29:12.217
- [Rachel] What's going on?

29:12.217 --> 29:15.019
- Nothing, my brother's already
here to pick me up I guess.

29:15.019 --> 29:15.920
- Oh, okay.

29:22.026 --> 29:23.294
- Goodnight.

29:23.294 --> 29:25.864
- Yeah yeah yeah,
  have a good night.

29:28.199 --> 29:29.701
- Hey hey hey, buddy.

29:29.701 --> 29:33.638
Tell your brother to lay
off that Jackass crap.

29:33.638 --> 29:34.739
- You got it.

29:36.107 --> 29:36.941
- Later.

29:44.149 --> 29:45.250
I'll be back!

29:47.252 --> 29:48.153
Hey rookie.

29:50.522 --> 29:52.190
Think this is yours.

29:53.691 --> 29:54.526
- Thanks.

29:57.228 --> 30:01.199
You know, I'm really
 looking forward to tomorrow.

30:01.199 --> 30:03.935
- And you wonder why
 I call you rookie.

30:03.935 --> 30:07.105
- Come on, it's all new to me.

30:07.105 --> 30:08.239
- Yeah.

30:08.239 --> 30:11.576
Don't let my bad
attitude rub off on you.

30:12.877 --> 30:14.779
- I mean we're artists.

30:15.880 --> 30:18.650
Isn't that what
 we're supposed to do?

30:18.650 --> 30:21.319
Show the world through our eyes?

30:33.031 --> 30:34.899
Can we go somewhere else?

30:34.899 --> 30:36.167
- Yeah, let's go to my tent.

30:36.167 --> 30:38.503
I can make us a showstopper.

30:39.470 --> 30:43.408
(gentle acoustic guitar music)

31:05.163 --> 31:07.765
- One showstopper, as promised.

31:14.606 --> 31:15.440
- Wow.

31:15.440 --> 31:16.274
- Right?

31:23.514 --> 31:24.682
My first show.

31:26.217 --> 31:28.386
- [Wil] Is that
  your mom with you?

31:28.386 --> 31:30.421
- No, that's my aunt Judy.

31:30.421 --> 31:33.258
Everyone around the
 shows called her Moon.

31:33.258 --> 31:35.493
She was an amazing painter.

31:36.628 --> 31:38.329
I started as her
 helper, going around

31:38.329 --> 31:42.000
shows while my parents
 were getting divorced.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.601
It was kinda messy.

31:53.845 --> 31:55.280
I don't know.

31:55.280 --> 31:57.682
Somehow Moon actually
 taught me how to

31:57.682 --> 32:01.519
take all these
confused, angry feelings

32:01.519 --> 32:04.555
and turn it into
 something beautiful.

32:04.555 --> 32:06.891
She always said that
 art helps you face the

32:06.891 --> 32:11.029
parts of yourself that
 you're trying to hide from.

32:11.029 --> 32:13.765
Losing her was
  the hardest thing.

32:16.801 --> 32:17.969
So first sale?

32:20.838 --> 32:22.173
How did it feel?

32:25.710 --> 32:28.913
- I don't know, it felt kinda...

32:28.913 --> 32:29.747
Kinda raw.

32:31.249 --> 32:32.950
Vulnerable.

32:32.950 --> 32:36.821
Seriously, you feel something
 when you sell, right?

32:36.821 --> 32:37.989
- No, I don't.

32:39.891 --> 32:43.561
I guess I feel somewhere
between relief and,

32:44.829 --> 32:46.798
well I think more about
where the money from

32:46.798 --> 32:50.835
the sale is going, like
  supplies, gas for my van.

32:50.835 --> 32:53.738
- Wow, you're just
 hardcore aren't you?

32:53.738 --> 32:57.542
- I would love to feel
 what you did, really.

32:57.542 --> 33:00.511
Maybe I've just been
 doing it for too long.

33:00.511 --> 33:05.016
Or maybe there's just nothing
 left of me inside of my work.

33:05.016 --> 33:06.951
Oh my God, that
  sounds really sad.

33:06.951 --> 33:08.519
- Yeah.

33:08.519 --> 33:11.389
- It's just automatic
 now, I put on

33:11.389 --> 33:15.593
the music, get out the
 supplies and make art.

33:15.593 --> 33:16.427
- Okay.

33:17.595 --> 33:20.298
Well then what kind of
music do you listen to?

33:20.298 --> 33:21.899
- I don't know, just music.

33:21.899 --> 33:23.434
- What do you mean just music?

33:23.434 --> 33:24.602
You got a playlist don't you?

33:24.602 --> 33:25.670

33:25.670 --> 33:26.871

33:26.871 --> 33:27.972

33:40.918 --> 33:43.187

33:44.956 --> 33:46.190

  some inspiration, huh?

33:49.994 --> 33:50.828

33:59.370 --> 34:00.204
- Me.

34:01.639 --> 34:02.473
- No shit.

34:03.975 --> 34:06.511
- It's just something I
do that's no pressure.

34:06.511 --> 34:10.681
I don't have to worry about
 if it's gonna sell or not.

34:11.716 --> 34:12.550
- Hey.

34:14.152 --> 34:15.420
It's beautiful.

34:16.554 --> 34:18.456
Just like you.

34:18.456 --> 34:21.659

  on all the ladies?

  it would work on you.

37:00.151 --> 37:01.052
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

37:01.052 --> 37:02.720
- Okay, sure.
 - Yeah.

37:25.142 --> 37:25.977
- Hey Wil.

37:28.012 --> 37:30.047
Who's that with Susan?

37:30.047 --> 37:30.881
- Where?

37:37.788 --> 37:38.956
I don't know.

37:38.956 --> 37:40.958
Saw them walking around
together earlier.

37:40.958 --> 37:42.627
- You guys asking about him?

37:42.627 --> 37:45.129
That's nobody, just the judge.

37:48.833 --> 37:49.834
- The judge?

37:51.469 --> 37:52.570
What do I do?

37:54.338 --> 37:56.007
- First, just relax.

37:56.007 --> 37:57.241
Just try and ignore him.

37:57.241 --> 37:58.709
If he's interested
 he'll ask about your

37:58.709 --> 38:00.745
process just to make sure
  you're the real deal.

38:00.745 --> 38:02.913
Whatever you do, don't bore him.

38:02.913 --> 38:05.850
- God, it sounds
  like speed dating.

38:13.691 --> 38:16.260
- Wil, this is Leman Merkavich.

38:17.328 --> 38:19.764
(clears throat)

38:19.764 --> 38:20.931
- Mer-ko-vich.

38:23.334 --> 38:24.335
- Merkovich.

38:25.369 --> 38:26.937
Of course, I'm so sorry.

38:26.937 --> 38:28.339
He is our judge, he's
 gonna be looking at

38:28.339 --> 38:32.009
your work and he may
 want to talk to you.

38:32.009 --> 38:32.843
- Maybe.

38:33.911 --> 38:35.246
- [Susan] Maybe.

38:37.982 --> 38:38.816
- Where you from?

38:38.816 --> 38:40.184
- No no no no no, no no.

38:40.184 --> 38:42.019
You don't talk to him.

38:43.187 --> 38:44.455
- [Wil] Where is he from?

38:44.455 --> 38:47.758
- [Susan] He owns a
 gallery in New York.

38:59.770 --> 39:02.440
- Young man, your
  artwork is like

39:03.641 --> 39:06.944

  on a cloudy day.

39:06.944 --> 39:08.045
- Oh, well thank you--

39:08.045 --> 39:09.113
- Sunshine...

39:11.015 --> 39:12.350
Is not my thing.

39:19.323 --> 39:20.424
- Did you see that guy?

39:20.424 --> 39:22.159
I mean what a complete dick.

39:22.159 --> 39:23.361
- Huge dick.

39:23.361 --> 39:25.129
He's gonna be great
 for this film.

39:25.129 --> 39:26.764
- Oh great, yeah, he
 shits on my paintings

39:26.764 --> 39:28.199
and your film gets
  better, fantastic.

39:28.199 --> 39:32.370
- I'm gonna make it look
 good, brotagonist, antagonist.

39:32.370 --> 39:33.537
- What the hell
  is a brotagonist?

39:33.537 --> 39:35.039
- [Orrie] You are!

39:50.354 --> 39:51.188
- Party.

40:00.297 --> 40:02.733

40:04.435 --> 40:06.670
- Oh, back from
 Berlin just in time to

40:06.670 --> 40:10.174
judge our little art
 show, huh Malafafung?

40:12.810 --> 40:13.811
- Hello Vic.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.748
Glad to see that
 you're still peddling

40:17.748 --> 40:20.684
this tired found
  art establishment.

40:22.153 --> 40:23.387
- Tired?

40:23.387 --> 40:24.755
The only thing that's
 tired is listening

40:24.755 --> 40:26.791
to you drone on and
 on about an art world

40:26.791 --> 40:28.292
that isn't good
 enough unless you and

40:28.292 --> 40:31.395
your fat cat asshole
friends agree about it.

40:31.395 --> 40:33.798
- This crap should not be
 allowed for the next 10 years.

40:33.798 --> 40:35.266
- Crap?

40:35.266 --> 40:36.734

  never even held a crayon!

40:38.803 --> 40:40.504

40:40.504 --> 40:42.573

40:43.841 --> 40:47.444
swear to God you

Sit.

40:54.652 --> 40:56.020
I am so so sorry.

40:56.020 --> 40:57.388
- [Leman] I have never been so

40:57.388 --> 40:58.956
disrespected in all of my life.

40:58.956 --> 41:00.257
- [Susan] I know.

41:28.953 --> 41:30.020
Wil, wait!

41:30.020 --> 41:31.355
Where you going?

41:32.490 --> 41:35.292
- We just need to get home.

41:35.292 --> 41:37.628
- Oh, you were gonna leave
  without saying goodbye?

41:37.628 --> 41:39.930
- I was gonna text you later.

41:39.930 --> 41:41.365
- Okay.

41:41.365 --> 41:45.369
Have you given anymore thought
 to what we talked about?

41:48.339 --> 41:49.173
- Yeah.

41:52.776 --> 41:54.745
I want to do the
 boardwalk art show.

 fantastic, I'll make

41:57.548 --> 41:58.382
- Thanks.

41:58.382 --> 41:59.650
- Yeah.

41:59.650 --> 42:00.818
- [Lorne] Susan, we've
got someone who's lost.

42:00.818 --> 42:02.019
- How old's the kid?

42:02.019 --> 42:04.922
- [Lorne] I'm guessing
 50 and he's drunk.

42:04.922 --> 42:06.156
- You know what, no.

42:06.156 --> 42:08.692
Someone else can handle this.

42:08.692 --> 42:10.594
Oh, so I talked to
 Merkovich and after

42:10.594 --> 42:13.530
I got him calmed down
 about the Vic thing,

42:13.530 --> 42:14.865
he said that your
  work was great,

42:14.865 --> 42:16.367
I mean you have
  to introduce some

42:16.367 --> 42:18.035
darker colors to bring
 a little more mystery

42:18.035 --> 42:21.538
into the palette, but
 overall really good.

42:22.973 --> 42:26.844
I'd love to come by your
  studio and talk about it.

42:26.844 --> 42:28.178
- Yeah, maybe.

42:28.178 --> 42:29.179
I gotta run.

42:30.347 --> 42:33.584
- Totally, yes, of course, yes.

42:33.584 --> 42:34.418
Okay.

 just forget about yesterday.

42:59.777 --> 43:02.880
Your mother seems to
 think I overreacted.

43:02.880 --> 43:05.916
- Dad, I wanna keep
 doing the shows.

43:05.916 --> 43:07.384

49:50.287 --> 49:51.188
- Hey Rach.

49:52.155 --> 49:53.156
What are you doing tonight?

49:53.156 --> 49:54.591
- I got plans.

49:54.591 --> 49:58.562
- Aw, remember when
 we used to have plans?

49:58.562 --> 50:01.398
- Vic, come on,
 what are you doing?

50:01.398 --> 50:05.235
- I just thought that maybe
 we could talk about us.

50:05.235 --> 50:07.304
- I thought we were
 just having fun.

50:07.304 --> 50:08.572
I mean aren't you the one that

50:08.572 --> 50:10.907
said you were too
  old for me anyway?

50:10.907 --> 50:13.610
- Yeah, well I mean age
is just a number right?

50:13.610 --> 50:16.413
- Vic, you know I think
you're really sweet,

50:16.413 --> 50:20.450
but we gotta go back to
  being just friends, okay?

50:20.450 --> 50:21.284
- All right.

50:21.284 --> 50:22.185
- Okay.

50:22.185 --> 50:23.887
- Just for now.

50:23.887 --> 50:27.024
Can't resist the
  forces of nature.

50:27.024 --> 50:27.858
- Okay.

50:36.566 --> 50:38.068
You looked so lost
  just sitting here,

50:38.068 --> 50:41.304
I was going to offer to
 take you to lost and found.

50:41.304 --> 50:43.340
- Yeah, it's a hot day.

50:43.340 --> 50:45.475
Just kinda spacing out.

50:45.475 --> 50:46.309
- Bingo?

50:49.146 --> 50:50.680
- Kid drops ice cream cone.

50:50.680 --> 50:52.215
- Congrats, you get to buy
  the first round tonight.

50:52.215 --> 50:53.784
Chief's RV at 7 PM.

50:55.452 --> 50:57.154
You might wanna leave
 your brother and his

50:57.154 --> 51:00.490
film crew behind, I don't
  think that would fly.

51:00.490 --> 51:01.525
- Got it.

51:01.525 --> 51:02.726
- Okay then.

51:02.726 --> 51:03.693
See you tonight?

51:03.693 --> 51:06.096
- Yeah, I'll see you tonight.

51:22.979 --> 51:23.814
Hey.

51:25.982 --> 51:28.051
Have you seen Orrie?

51:28.051 --> 51:30.821
- Yeah, he's out
grabbing B-roll.

51:30.821 --> 51:31.655
- Got it.

51:35.525 --> 51:39.696
- You know, it kills me to
 say this, but you got talent.

51:41.565 --> 51:43.066
- Hey thanks, man.

51:44.167 --> 51:47.604
- Hey, I got a surprise for you.

51:47.604 --> 51:49.673
Come with me to my booth.

51:51.775 --> 51:52.609
- Okay.

52:00.584 --> 52:03.520
What'd you say this flavor was?

52:03.520 --> 52:04.454
- Colorado.

52:08.258 --> 52:10.026
- Should I have the whole thing?

52:10.026 --> 52:11.628
- Oh it's a creeper
 man, I mean you can

52:11.628 --> 52:15.131
go for it, but it might
come on you quick.

52:24.007 --> 52:25.008
Look at her.

52:27.177 --> 52:28.011
- What?

52:30.914 --> 52:32.349
- I mean why is she even here

52:32.349 --> 52:35.652
if she's not gonna
  pay attention?

52:35.652 --> 52:37.320
Oh there it is.

52:37.320 --> 52:38.889
See?

52:38.889 --> 52:41.391
Yes, you're having an emotion.

52:42.559 --> 52:44.561
Try doing it more often.

52:45.962 --> 52:49.599
Put your frickin' cell phone
down, you might get used to it.

52:49.599 --> 52:50.433
Hey.

52:52.068 --> 52:53.904
That's why we're here.

52:59.442 --> 53:01.978
(laughs)

53:01.978 --> 53:04.014
That and the brownies.

53:04.014 --> 53:04.915
- They're good.

53:04.915 --> 53:07.350
(snickering)

53:19.262 --> 53:22.332
I've been thinking about trying
my luck in New York again.

53:22.332 --> 53:24.901
- I've been down that road, man.

53:24.901 --> 53:26.703
- Oh yeah, when?

53:26.703 --> 53:28.438
- Late 90s.

53:28.438 --> 53:30.006
I ran around with a
 bunch of sycophants

53:30.006 --> 53:32.876
and Wall Street money types.

53:32.876 --> 53:34.211
Anybody ever tells
  you they stopped

53:34.211 --> 53:37.047
doing coke after the
 80s, that's a myth.

53:37.047 --> 53:39.316
(laughter)

53:42.886 --> 53:45.188
- So what happened?

53:45.188 --> 53:47.457
- I crashed and burned, man.

53:47.457 --> 53:48.692
Yup, that's me.

53:50.527 --> 53:53.263
I'm that art show
  bad boy cliche.

53:55.098 --> 53:57.000
I blame myself, really.

53:58.168 --> 54:00.604
I didn't have the
 right support system.

54:00.604 --> 54:03.807
Didn't have the right
  people keeping me in line.

54:03.807 --> 54:07.243
So now I stay away
  from the city,

54:07.243 --> 54:10.647
take care of myself,
 take care of my art.

54:12.582 --> 54:14.618
- Your art's great, man.

54:14.618 --> 54:16.052
- Hey, thank you.

54:17.621 --> 54:20.490
You know what else is great?

54:20.490 --> 54:21.324
Rachel.

54:24.527 --> 54:25.362
- Rachel.

54:28.732 --> 54:30.200
- Yeah, she just
 doesn't give a shit

54:30.200 --> 54:33.870
about anyone or
 anything and I guess

54:33.870 --> 54:36.306
that's just what makes her so...

54:36.306 --> 54:37.140
- Great?

54:38.508 --> 54:39.342
- Yeah.

54:48.618 --> 54:49.586
- Hey.

54:49.586 --> 54:50.987
- Hey.

54:50.987 --> 54:52.422
You looked stressed.

54:52.422 --> 54:54.357
- Oh no, the cotton
  candy guy had a meltdown.

54:54.357 --> 54:55.825
Literally and figuratively.

54:55.825 --> 54:57.761
- Sorry to hear that.

54:57.761 --> 55:00.397
- Look, I have some
 news about Merkovich.

55:00.397 --> 55:01.164
- Really?

55:01.164 --> 55:02.632
What's up?

55:02.632 --> 55:04.601
- Well he wants to include
 you in a group show this fall.

55:04.601 --> 55:06.503
I mean he has some ideas
 you're gonna need to embrace,

55:06.503 --> 55:09.005
but you should come by my hotel

55:09.005 --> 55:11.708
later and we can talk about it.

55:11.708 --> 55:13.176
- Later later?

55:13.176 --> 55:14.477
'Cause I promised Orrie and
 the crew I'd get dinner.

55:14.477 --> 55:16.212
- Come after.

55:16.212 --> 55:17.080
- Okay, I'll try.

55:17.080 --> 55:18.882
- Well don't try.

55:18.882 --> 55:20.784
Wil, this is important.

55:21.651 --> 55:22.485
- Okay.

55:27.223 --> 55:29.993
(synthpop music)

55:38.134 --> 55:39.502
- [Orrie] You come
 around this, right on

55:39.502 --> 55:40.503
Wil's shoulder all right?

55:40.503 --> 55:41.504
- Guys, stop following me.

55:41.504 --> 55:42.839
- He's gonna swoop around--

55:42.839 --> 55:44.708
- Orrie, not tonight!

55:44.708 --> 55:46.276
- Come on man, this is
 gonna be such a good moment.

55:46.276 --> 55:49.245
- Look, I need to figure
 out this Rachel thing okay?

55:49.245 --> 55:50.647
- Well come on, I'm not
gonna bother anybody.

55:50.647 --> 55:53.483
- Can you just
 give me some space?

55:54.451 --> 55:55.285
- Okay.

55:56.219 --> 55:57.887
Okay.

55:57.887 --> 56:00.223
Shut it down Lance, come on.

56:02.392 --> 56:03.660
Come on, Lance.

56:05.595 --> 56:06.830
- All hail Wil!

56:06.830 --> 56:08.131
Today's Bingo winner!

56:08.131 --> 56:09.399
(cheering)

56:09.399 --> 56:11.768
- Thank you guys, thank
you all very very much.

56:11.768 --> 56:13.636
Oh, and of course a
 very special thanks to

56:13.636 --> 56:16.306
the little boy who dropped
  his ice cream cone.

56:16.306 --> 56:18.575
(cheering)

56:22.712 --> 56:24.147
Long time no see.

56:26.616 --> 56:29.052
- Your enthusiasm is very cute.

56:29.052 --> 56:30.620
- Cute, really?

56:30.620 --> 56:32.555
- No no no, it's
 good for us road dogs

56:32.555 --> 56:35.258
to be reminded of
 it once in a while.

56:35.258 --> 56:37.093
- What's a road dog?

56:37.093 --> 56:39.829
- It's what we call
old timers around here.

56:39.829 --> 56:42.098
- Well you're not that old.

56:42.966 --> 56:45.135
- I am in dog years, yeah.

56:53.443 --> 56:57.347
I'm really happy you're
  doing the boardwalk show.

56:57.347 --> 56:58.148
- Me too.

56:59.349 --> 57:02.552
- "Your work is like
 a ray of sunshine."

57:03.720 --> 57:06.356
- You know, believe
 it or not, Susan said

57:06.356 --> 57:09.025
that he wants to show some of my

57:10.193 --> 57:12.962
paintings at his
  show in New York.

57:12.962 --> 57:17.133
But apparently I would
 have to embrace some notes.

57:18.301 --> 57:21.037
- Well I think you need
to ask yourself do you

57:21.037 --> 57:24.874
wanna be successful, or
do you wanna be happy?

57:26.442 --> 57:28.411
- I've been inspired
 by your whole

57:28.411 --> 57:32.081
attitude towards your
 art and your music.

57:32.081 --> 57:34.083
It's all just so honest.

57:47.230 --> 57:49.933
- I've written a
 couple of new songs.

57:49.933 --> 57:50.767
- Oh yeah?

57:51.868 --> 57:52.702
Can I hear them?

57:52.702 --> 57:54.003
- Not here.

57:54.003 --> 57:55.505
- Okay.

57:55.505 --> 57:58.241
- But I could be talked into
 giving you a private concert.

57:58.241 --> 58:02.679
- I think that's good, I'd
 actually like that very much.

58:02.679 --> 58:03.880
- Okay.

58:03.880 --> 58:05.982
So here's the plan.

58:05.982 --> 58:08.451
I'm gonna get up,
  call it a night,

58:08.451 --> 58:10.820
and then you're gonna
 wait a couple minutes,

58:10.820 --> 58:13.289
and then you're gonna
get up and you're gonna

58:13.289 --> 58:16.626
call it a night and
 meet me at my booth.

58:17.660 --> 58:19.262
- Pretty sneaky.

58:19.262 --> 58:20.864
- It's just these
  guys are like a

58:20.864 --> 58:23.600
bunch of old ladies
when it comes to gossip.

58:23.600 --> 58:24.968
Besides, Chief's like my dad.

58:24.968 --> 58:25.902
- I get it.

58:28.438 --> 58:29.472
- All right.

58:29.472 --> 58:30.473
- All right.

58:31.808 --> 58:34.377
- Okay losers, you're boring me.

58:34.377 --> 58:35.645
I'm outta here.
- What?

58:35.645 --> 58:36.913
Oh come on!

58:36.913 --> 58:38.748
You're leaving already?

58:38.748 --> 58:40.216
It's not even late!

58:40.216 --> 58:41.050
- Get real.

58:41.050 --> 58:42.385
- Rach, come on!

59:00.169 --> 59:04.007
(gentle acoustic guitar music)

59:16.486 --> 59:19.389
- Hey, don't stop playing.

59:19.389 --> 59:21.291
- That's just something
I've been working on.

59:21.291 --> 59:22.558
- I liked it, it's pretty.

59:22.558 --> 59:24.093
- Thank you.

59:24.093 --> 59:27.430
But I will play you another
 song that I wrote recently.

59:27.430 --> 59:29.065
I've never played it before for

59:29.065 --> 59:31.134
anyone, this is the first time.

59:31.134 --> 59:32.802
- Well I'm honored.

59:32.802 --> 59:34.070
- Might be the last.

59:34.070 --> 59:35.405
- [Wil] Come on.

It's short for Wilbur.

01:01:08.731 --> 01:01:12.335
Does that help you figure
 out what Orrie's short for?

01:01:12.335 --> 01:01:14.237

Oh my God, like the

not embarrassing the
 shit out of his kids.

01:01:24.514 --> 01:01:27.183

I mean she doesn't

01:04:29.298 --> 01:04:32.168
still might go to
 New York with Susan.

 is what makes a good film.

01:04:45.014 --> 01:04:45.982
Hey, what's up?

01:04:45.982 --> 01:04:47.350

 Wright Brothers.

01:04:51.754 --> 01:04:54.490
- Why don't you ask Orrie,
 he seems to know everything.

01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:56.025
You know, I'm not just
 some pit stop for you

01:04:56.025 --> 01:04:57.827

 actually want in life.

01:04:57.827 --> 01:04:58.995

no idea what you're
 talking about.

01:05:00.263 --> 01:05:01.197
- Just leave me alone.

01:05:01.197 --> 01:05:03.232

01:05:49.712 --> 01:05:50.713
- Thank you.

01:05:56.285 --> 01:05:57.119
- Um...

01:05:58.554 --> 01:05:59.388
The price?

01:06:00.523 --> 01:06:02.024
- It's right there.

01:06:02.024 --> 01:06:05.494
- Yeah, I know, I just,
  is that your final price?

01:06:05.494 --> 01:06:07.496
- This isn't a garage sale, man.

01:06:07.496 --> 01:06:10.232
- Oh I know, I
 didn't mean anything

01:06:10.232 --> 01:06:13.002
by that, but I had to ask.

01:06:13.002 --> 01:06:14.670
- No, no you didn't.

01:06:17.139 --> 01:06:20.142
- [Customer] I just
 figured I'd try.

01:06:23.079 --> 01:06:24.513
- It hurts, man.

01:06:24.513 --> 01:06:25.681
I mean how would you
 like it if every day

01:06:25.681 --> 01:06:26.882
you came to work and your boss

01:06:26.882 --> 01:06:28.384
negotiated your
 salary with you, huh?

01:06:28.384 --> 01:06:29.885
- Look, I didn't mean
anything by it, I just--

01:06:29.885 --> 01:06:31.587
- Well that's the
price, it's right there.

01:06:31.587 --> 01:06:33.489
- Well it's definitely worth it.

01:06:33.489 --> 01:06:34.657
- Damn right it is.

01:06:34.657 --> 01:06:36.192
- Do you take checks?

01:06:36.192 --> 01:06:37.426
- Yes.

01:06:37.426 --> 01:06:40.162
I need your address
 and your phone number.

01:06:40.162 --> 01:06:41.831
And make it out to me.

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:42.665
- All right.

01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:43.666
- It's on the card.

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:44.600
- All right.

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.569
- Tax brings it to 5,300.

01:06:47.903 --> 01:06:48.738
- Tax huh?

01:06:51.874 --> 01:06:53.242
Okay.

01:06:53.242 --> 01:06:54.677
5,300, all right.

01:07:00.182 --> 01:07:03.119
I don't know, maybe I
need to think this over.

01:07:03.119 --> 01:07:04.220
I'll be back.

01:07:07.089 --> 01:07:07.990
- Hey, hey!

01:07:08.958 --> 01:07:10.326
Hey what's this man?

01:07:10.326 --> 01:07:11.160
Huh?

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:11.994
- Hey, look buddy.

01:07:11.994 --> 01:07:12.928
- What's this, huh?

01:07:12.928 --> 01:07:14.029
Who put you up to this, huh?

01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:15.164
- Deal with him.

01:07:15.164 --> 01:07:17.466
- What's going on here?

01:07:17.466 --> 01:07:19.034
You little prick.

01:07:19.034 --> 01:07:20.736
I oughta shove that
thing right up your ass.

01:07:20.736 --> 01:07:21.971
You think this is funny?

01:07:21.971 --> 01:07:23.506
- Careful what you
 say on camera, Vic.

01:07:23.506 --> 01:07:25.107
- Hey, whoa whoa whoa,
 guys, hey, what's up?

01:07:25.107 --> 01:07:26.375
- Your brother
 sent an actor in to

01:07:26.375 --> 01:07:27.843
jerk me around so
  he could film it!

01:07:27.843 --> 01:07:29.445
- Actually it's not film,
  it's a capture card.

01:07:29.445 --> 01:07:31.514
- You know, I don't give
a shit what it is, man.

01:07:31.514 --> 01:07:34.016
You have got no right messing
 with another man's livelihood!

01:07:34.016 --> 01:07:35.084
- What are you doing?

01:07:35.084 --> 01:07:36.318
- I didn't do anything Wil,

01:07:36.318 --> 01:07:37.520
I'm just trying to
  get a good shot.

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:38.754
- No Orrie, that's
  over the line.

01:07:38.754 --> 01:07:39.688
Come on.

01:07:39.688 --> 01:07:40.723
- I'll show you over the line.

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:41.724
- Hey, dude!

01:07:48.631 --> 01:07:50.666
- You are done!

01:07:50.666 --> 01:07:52.034
You have got to go!

01:07:52.034 --> 01:07:53.135
- Me?

01:07:53.135 --> 01:07:54.336
I was just assaulted.

01:07:54.336 --> 01:07:56.272
- I don't care!

01:07:56.272 --> 01:07:58.674
Orrie, nobody wants you here.

01:07:58.674 --> 01:08:00.142
- Yeah, good riddance, man.

01:08:00.142 --> 01:08:01.210
- Vic, you're out too.

01:08:01.210 --> 01:08:02.344
- What for?

01:08:02.344 --> 01:08:03.512
- Are you kidding?

01:08:03.512 --> 01:08:05.014
I don't even know where
to start with you,

01:08:05.014 --> 01:08:08.250
you are rude to
 customers and judges.

01:08:08.250 --> 01:08:10.252
You're drunk and disorderly.

01:08:10.252 --> 01:08:12.288
This is not your show, Vic.

01:08:12.288 --> 01:08:14.723
This is everyone's show.

01:08:14.723 --> 01:08:15.558
Leave!

01:08:18.961 --> 01:08:19.795
Go!

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:26.569
- What do we do?

01:08:28.203 --> 01:08:29.037
- We?

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:31.506
No, there is no we.

01:08:32.707 --> 01:08:35.578
Why don't you just
  clear out of here.

01:08:49.992 --> 01:08:51.993
I mean how did she even
 get packed up that quickly?

01:08:51.993 --> 01:08:53.828
- Show ended, she was gone.

01:08:53.828 --> 01:08:55.731
- I don't even know
 why she's upset.

01:08:55.731 --> 01:08:57.633
- Apparently Orrie's
 crew was watching

01:08:57.633 --> 01:09:00.502
a video of you two on
 the beach last night.

01:09:00.502 --> 01:09:02.805
- God's sake, why?

01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:05.341
Why would he even possibly
  think that's a good idea?

01:09:05.341 --> 01:09:07.009
I mean even for him.

01:09:09.245 --> 01:09:10.779
No wonder she...

01:09:10.779 --> 01:09:12.281
Do you have any
 idea where she went?

01:09:12.281 --> 01:09:14.082
- I have no idea.

01:09:14.082 --> 01:09:15.885
- Okay, thanks Chief.

01:09:15.885 --> 01:09:19.787
(gentle acoustic guitar music)

01:09:26.795 --> 01:09:28.764
It's Wil, please
leave a message.

01:09:28.764 --> 01:09:30.198
(answering machine beeps)

01:09:30.198 --> 01:09:31.867
- [Susan] Hey Wil, it's Susan.

01:09:31.867 --> 01:09:33.135
It's been a few weeks since the

01:09:33.135 --> 01:09:34.537
boardwalk and I'm
 gonna be heading back

01:09:34.537 --> 01:09:37.072
to New York after the
 show this weekend.

01:09:37.072 --> 01:09:40.042
I really hate the way
 that we left things.

01:09:40.042 --> 01:09:42.912
If you wanna clear the
  air, I'd really like that.

01:09:42.912 --> 01:09:45.147
Anyway, ball's in your court.

01:09:45.147 --> 01:09:46.148
Let me know.

01:10:05.067 --> 01:10:06.902
- Well I'll be damned.

01:10:07.803 --> 01:10:09.138
- Man, I'm not here okay?

01:10:09.138 --> 01:10:13.042
- Hey, keep your pants
on, I'm not here either.

01:10:18.981 --> 01:10:23.152
- Look, Vic, I'm sorry about
 how everything went down.

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:26.055
- Aw shut up.

01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:27.656
Come on, I was on
 my way out already.

01:10:27.656 --> 01:10:29.658
As if you couldn't tell.

01:10:33.596 --> 01:10:34.830
Still painting?

01:10:36.732 --> 01:10:37.833
- Not really.

01:10:40.269 --> 01:10:42.771
Kinda lost the thrill of it.

01:10:42.771 --> 01:10:43.939
How about you?

01:10:45.774 --> 01:10:47.476
- Just got my 30 day chip.

01:10:47.476 --> 01:10:49.345
- Hey, all right.

01:10:49.345 --> 01:10:52.314
- I'm living clean again,
  I'm on a green tea diet.

01:10:52.314 --> 01:10:53.215
- [Wil] Green tea huh?

01:10:53.215 --> 01:10:54.516
That work?

01:10:54.516 --> 01:10:56.385
- Yeah, I'm doing
 whatever they tell me.

01:10:56.385 --> 01:10:58.954
I gotta make it work this time.

01:11:00.823 --> 01:11:04.493
Hey, I got a meeting
 in 10 minutes.

01:11:04.493 --> 01:11:05.894
You wanna walk?

01:11:05.894 --> 01:11:06.729
- Sure.

01:11:07.663 --> 01:11:09.164
- You know what?

01:11:09.164 --> 01:11:12.001
You are so close to something,
 you just can't even see it.

01:11:12.001 --> 01:11:13.202
You should take a
  page out of your

01:11:13.202 --> 01:11:17.640
brother's book, he knows
how to take chances.

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:20.342
Oh, you guys still
 aren't talking huh?

01:11:20.342 --> 01:11:22.645
I had a brother who
 was a lot like Orrie.

01:11:22.645 --> 01:11:26.548
He was a real piece of work,
 he loved to stir the pot.

01:11:26.548 --> 01:11:29.184
But deep down he was
 a really good guy.

01:11:29.184 --> 01:11:31.787
Maybe that's why I
 let Orrie get my goat.

01:11:31.787 --> 01:11:33.522
Old dynamics at play.

01:11:34.990 --> 01:11:38.894
Anyway, he passed away before
 I had a chance to make amends.

01:11:40.429 --> 01:11:44.900
Do yourself a favor and
get right with Orrie.

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:47.202
- Yeah, kinda takes
 two to do that.

01:11:47.202 --> 01:11:49.071
- Yeah, I know it does.

01:11:49.071 --> 01:11:51.140
And I know that he's an ass.

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:53.308
But you know what, Wilbur?

01:11:53.308 --> 01:11:55.177
You two need each other.

01:11:55.177 --> 01:11:56.445
I mean if you read
  anything about the

01:11:56.445 --> 01:11:57.680
Wright Brothers you
 know that neither

01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:59.348
one of them would've
flown without the other.

01:11:59.348 --> 01:12:00.983
- Yeah, well we're kinda
grounded right now.

01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:02.951
- You get things right
 with Orrie, you'd be

01:12:02.951 --> 01:12:06.422
surprised how many things
  fall into place for you.

01:12:06.422 --> 01:12:10.359

- No answer was answer enough.

01:14:02.938 --> 01:14:04.540
Anyway, it's my last
week here, so I'm gonna

be very happy to get
 back to my real life.

- No, look, seriously, I didn't

01:14:07.810 --> 01:14:09.044
answer because I
didn't know what

01:14:09.044 --> 01:14:12.047
to say, but I think
 I've got it now.

01:14:13.782 --> 01:14:15.684
You're smart.

01:14:15.684 --> 01:14:17.119
And really talented, and I know

01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:19.688
you're gonna do big

01:14:29.097 --> 01:14:31.600

01:16:03.659 --> 01:16:05.360
I wanna offer you something.

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:06.194
- What?

01:16:12.601 --> 01:16:15.304

Don't hold back.

01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:20.108

01:16:20.108 --> 01:16:21.209
- Yeah.

01:16:21.209 --> 01:16:22.444
I deserve this.

01:16:27.349 --> 01:16:29.918
Didn't think you'd
  actually do it.

01:16:29.918 --> 01:16:32.588
- Why, you said you deserved it.

01:16:34.589 --> 01:16:35.991

01:16:50.939 --> 01:16:54.009
- So I was looking through
  some of the footage.

01:16:54.009 --> 01:16:55.377
I came across that
  little piece where

01:16:55.377 --> 01:16:59.047
Rachel's explaining her
artistic motivation.

01:17:01.283 --> 01:17:02.684
Really struck me.

01:17:05.187 --> 01:17:08.290
Think I'm gonna
 explore more of that.

01:17:09.925 --> 01:17:10.926
- Good, man.

01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:13.328
You know, I think that that

01:17:13.328 --> 01:17:16.098
really is the
 heart of the shows.

01:17:23.572 --> 01:17:25.741

 let's take a picture.

01:17:25.741 --> 01:17:26.575

01:18:02.010 --> 01:18:02.844
- Yes.

01:18:41.883 --> 01:18:43.418
- That looks really nice.

01:18:43.418 --> 01:18:45.153
- No way dude, what
 are you doing here?

01:18:45.153 --> 01:18:46.521
- Just a second,
 I'm not filming this

01:18:46.521 --> 01:18:48.223
by the way, I have
  no camera, see?

01:18:48.223 --> 01:18:50.092
- How did you even find me?

01:18:50.092 --> 01:18:52.227
- New lows in internet stalking.

01:18:52.227 --> 01:18:54.262
- I don't post anything
on the internet.

01:18:54.262 --> 01:18:56.264

01:18:57.466 --> 01:18:58.900
Hi, Mrs. Dante.

01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:00.135
- Hi.

01:19:00.135 --> 01:19:01.970
- I'm Orrie Hunter,
 I'm Wil's brother.

01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:03.305
- What happened to your eye?

01:19:03.305 --> 01:19:04.840
- Oh I got punched.

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.842
My brother punched
  me, I deserved it.

01:19:06.842 --> 01:19:08.944
- Yeah, I'm sure you did.

01:19:10.145 --> 01:19:12.848
- Look Rachel, I'm
  here to apologize.

01:19:12.848 --> 01:19:17.018
Please don't blame Will for
 this, this is all my fault.

01:19:18.487 --> 01:19:20.922
I'm an ass, plain and simple.

01:19:22.691 --> 01:19:23.859

01:19:25.427 --> 01:19:27.929
And he really cares about you.

01:19:29.364 --> 01:19:33.201
A lot more than I've seen
  him care about anybody.

01:19:34.803 --> 01:19:36.972
Rachel, Wil is the
  most thoughtful,

01:19:36.972 --> 01:19:38.440
kindhearted person that I know

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:41.176
and he is so sad
right now and...

01:19:42.544 --> 01:19:44.379
And it's all my fault.

01:19:49.584 --> 01:19:52.087
So if you could do me a favor.

01:19:53.488 --> 01:19:54.923
Just talk to him.

01:19:55.924 --> 01:19:58.093
That's all I want.

01:19:58.093 --> 01:19:59.494
Please.

01:19:59.494 --> 01:20:00.495
- Oh my God.

01:20:01.997 --> 01:20:03.298
- [Orrie] I'll drive if you
 guys have had too much--

01:20:03.298 --> 01:20:06.835
- I can't deal with
 this right now, Orrie.

01:20:06.835 --> 01:20:08.637
Can you just get out of here?

01:20:08.637 --> 01:20:11.072
- [Orrie] Yeah, yeah.

01:20:11.072 --> 01:20:12.240
It's lovely to meet you.

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:13.675
- Sorry.

01:20:13.675 --> 01:20:16.178
- [Orrie] Just think about it.

01:20:20.582 --> 01:20:24.419
- [Rachel] I really don't
  wanna talk about it.

01:20:55.150 --> 01:20:56.151
- [Wil] Hey.

01:20:58.653 --> 01:20:59.487

01:21:11.032 --> 01:21:13.101
- This is your best work.

01:21:19.908 --> 01:21:21.843
Rachel would love that.

01:21:24.679 --> 01:21:25.914
- Yeah, I've tried to reach out

01:21:25.914 --> 01:21:28.583
to her a few times,
 but I don't think

01:21:28.583 --> 01:21:32.454
she wants to have
anything to do with me.

01:21:32.454 --> 01:21:33.855
- I'm sorry, man.

01:21:38.493 --> 01:21:41.496
Wish there was
 something I could do.

01:22:03.652 --> 01:22:06.254
