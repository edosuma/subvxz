ZUCKER:
You have any thoughts about...
why you had that dream now?

16:37.506 --> 16:40.673
It could be that he was...
telling me not to confuse him

16:40.756 --> 16:42.589
with Ollie Peterson, though,
'cause he would've been

16:42.673 --> 16:44.839
the same age as Ollie,
if Ollie lived.

Maria Caneles
at the hotel bar.

Luis Aparicio's death,

25:26.005 --> 25:28.464

seemingly accidental

25:28.547 --> 25:30.089

with an individual

with Terry Maitland,

they were victims themselves.

This thing that became Heath
did that.

I don't think he had a choice.

30:07.881 --> 30:09.047

I'm not ready to say I don't.

30:33.422 --> 30:34.506
HOWARD: Okay.

30:35.381 --> 30:36.381
PELLEY: Look,

30:36.464 --> 30:38.964
a lot of the things
that she said,

30:39.047 --> 30:41.130
about myths and legends
over history,

30:41.214 --> 30:43.047
I've actually read a lot
of that stuff.

30:44.089 --> 30:45.255
-You have?
-Yeah.

30:45.964 --> 30:47.631
And over the centuries...

30:47.714 --> 30:49.673
you know,
people got called devils,

30:49.756 --> 30:53.297
and demons,
you know, called witches.

30:53.381 --> 30:56.673
The werewolf of this,
the vampire of that.

30:56.756 --> 30:58.964
And we always say,
"Well, people back then,

30:59.047 --> 31:00.547
they were ignorant,

31:00.631 --> 31:03.172
and hysterical
and superstitious."

31:03.255 --> 31:07.130
Because nowadays,
we've got science, psychology.

31:07.214 --> 31:10.422
So we know better than
to mistake humans for demons.

31:13.089 --> 31:14.464
You know, but what if...

31:16.089 --> 31:21.714
What if every now and then,
we mistake a demon for a human?

31:23.798 --> 31:26.339
-HOWARD: Very interesting.
-I think so.

31:28.506 --> 31:30.798
Did you ever hear the one
about the Yiddish vampire?

31:31.964 --> 31:34.881
Vampire, he flies in
through the window of a church,

31:34.964 --> 31:37.381
his fangs are out,
priest immediately goes

31:37.464 --> 31:40.130
for a crucifix.
Shoves it in his face,

31:40.214 --> 31:43.422
"Back, you fiend."
Vampire laughs, says,

31:44.297 --> 31:46.172
"Ni gunisht helfen, bubbalah."

31:47.798 --> 31:49.464
"It ain't gonna help you,
baby."

31:52.631 --> 31:53.673
He says it in Yiddish.

31:55.005 --> 31:56.005

33:24.547 --> 33:26.589
I wasn't sure
what they all signified.

They signify his transformation.

So far,

33:31.923 --> 33:36.339
it kills every 24 to 27 days.
What I couldn't figure out was,

33:36.422 --> 33:39.255
why he waited...
Wh-- What the time meant.

33:40.756 --> 33:42.422
But, Jeannie,
it's all right here.

33:45.381 --> 33:46.631
He was transforming.

33:50.547 --> 33:51.881
JEANNIE: He was sitting
at this table...

33:51.964 --> 33:53.214
-Which chair?
-This one.

33:53.297 --> 33:55.506
Um, but-- but it was pushed
back there,

33:55.589 --> 33:57.464
and I was sitting right here.

33:57.547 --> 33:59.089
Did you dust for fingerprints?

34:00.506 --> 34:04.255
I checked the rug
beneath the legs

34:04.339 --> 34:06.839
and there was no indentation.

34:06.923 --> 34:10.130
There was no sign that someone
had been sitting there recently.

34:12.422 --> 34:14.547
No alarms were triggered,

34:14.631 --> 34:16.172
and there
were no broken windows,

34:16.255 --> 34:18.547
so there was absolutely no sign
of a break-in.

34:18.631 --> 34:20.464
So, you didn't dust
for fingerprints?

34:22.172 --> 34:23.631
No, I did not.

34:26.005 --> 34:28.130
Do you have any Scotch tape
in the house?

34:28.214 --> 34:30.631
-In the desk.
-Um, any colored markers?

34:31.297 --> 34:32.798
Derek has-- had some.

34:33.422 --> 34:34.964
I'll check in his room.

So, um, El...
El Cuco, right?

34:47.130 --> 34:48.964
HOLLY: More like
some hybrid entity.

34:49.047 --> 34:51.130
Like I said, it's been known
by a number of names.

34:52.339 --> 34:55.381
But I guess
"El Cuco" is close enough.

34:55.464 --> 34:58.005
Hm. Yeah, I guess it...

something to be true,

37:01.297 --> 37:02.881
Right.
Assumptions aren't gonna fly.

We gotta have it tested.

been tested?

-They're still working on them.
-Still?

37:17.297 --> 37:19.589
That's because they found
a number of unknown substances

37:19.673 --> 37:20.923
and they've never considered
the fact

37:21.005 --> 37:22.547

isn't human,

it isn't animal,
it isn't mineral, or vegetable,

it isn't even of this world,

41:44.756 --> 41:46.964
