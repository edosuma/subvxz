41:27.610 --> 41:29.154
OH, REALLY?

41:29.195 --> 41:31.489
THEN WHERE THE HELL WERE YOU

41:29.195 --> 41:31.489

41:31.530 --> 41:33.491
AND WOULD ONLY EAT MASHED

41:31.530 --> 41:33.491
POTATOES FOR A WEEK?

41:33.532 --> 41:37.245
OR WHERE WERE YOU WHEN

41:33.532 --> 41:37.245
SHE GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL

41:33.532 --> 41:37.245
OR STARTED COLLEGE, HUH?

41:37.287 --> 41:39.456
WHO THE HELL MOVED

41:37.287 --> 41:39.456

41:39.497 --> 41:41.374
AND OUT OF HER DORM

41:39.497 --> 41:41.374
AND BACK INTO HER DORM?

41:41.416 --> 41:42.792
THIS IS NOT THE TIME.

41:42.834 --> 41:44.669
WHERE I WAS

41:42.834 --> 41:44.669
DOESN'T CONCERN YOU.

41:44.710 --> 41:47.172
RORY IS MY DAUGHTER AND

41:44.710 --> 41:47.172
LORELAI'S DAUGHTER -- THAT'S IT!

41:47.213 --> 41:49.090
WELL, I'M WITH LORELAI.

41:47.213 --> 41:49.090

41:49.132 --> 41:50.716
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

41:49.132 --> 41:50.716
IS THAT A THREAT?

41:50.758 --> 41:52.718
LORELAI AND I

41:50.758 --> 41:52.718
BELONG TOGETHER.

41:52.760 --> 41:55.513
EVERYONE KNOWS IT.

41:52.760 --> 41:55.513
EMILY KNOWS IT.

41:52.760 --> 41:55.513
WHAT?

41:55.554 --> 41:58.141
LOOK, I BLEW IT, OKAY?

41:55.554 --> 41:58.141
I KNOW THAT I BLEW IT.

41:58.183 --> 42:00.101
YOU WAITED AND I DIDN'T

41:58.183 --> 42:00.101
COME THROUGH,

42:00.143 --> 42:02.687
AND NOW YOU'RE WITH HIM,

42:00.143 --> 42:02.687
BUT IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

42:00.143 --> 42:02.687
DON'T.

42:02.728 --> 42:05.315
IT'S NOT TOO LATE -- EMILY

42:02.728 --> 42:05.315
TOLD ME IT WASN'T TOO LATE.

42:05.357 --> 42:07.025
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE,

42:05.357 --> 42:07.025
OKAY?

42:07.066 --> 42:09.819
I KNOW YOU'RE WITH HIM,

42:07.066 --> 42:09.819
BUT IT'S NOT FOREVER.

42:09.861 --> 42:13.490
LUKE, I-I DON'T KNOW

42:09.861 --> 42:13.490
WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

42:13.531 --> 42:16.284
I GOT TO

42:13.531 --> 42:16.284
GET OUT OF HERE.

42:13.531 --> 42:16.284
OH, LUKE, WAIT --

42:16.326 --> 42:18.536
CHRISTOPHER,

42:16.326 --> 42:18.536

42:23.291 --> 42:24.959
PLEASE, STOP.

42:25.001 --> 42:26.961
GET AWAY FROM ME.

42:25.001 --> 42:26.961
I JUST WANNA TALK.

42:27.003 --> 42:28.754
GET SOME COFFEE,

42:27.003 --> 42:28.754
CHRISTOPHER!

42:28.796 --> 42:30.756
THIS WASN'T THE WAY

42:28.796 --> 42:30.756
I WANTED IT.

42:30.798 --> 42:32.550
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

42:32.591 --> 42:34.260
I'M GOING AFTER LUKE.

42:34.302 --> 42:37.430
THERE YOU ARE!

42:34.302 --> 42:37.430
I'VE GOT HER!

42:37.472 --> 42:41.434
OH, YOU CANNOT KEEP

42:37.472 --> 42:41.434
A ROOMFUL OF ANGLO-SAXONS

42:41.476 --> 42:43.395
WAITING FOR CAKE THIS LONG.

42:43.436 --> 42:46.189
THEY START

42:43.436 --> 42:46.189
TO FORM MORE CLUBS.

42:46.231 --> 42:48.274
TAKE HER, TAKE HER,

42:46.231 --> 42:48.274

42:48.316 --> 42:51.652

42:54.613 --> 42:58.243
HOLD THAT.

42:58.284 --> 43:00.953

43:00.995 --> 43:02.955
ONE, TWO, THREE.
