WEBVTT

00:17.476 --> 00:18.853
Suspects ran out
of the restoration room.

00:18.853 --> 00:20.146
Cover all exits.

00:20.146 --> 00:21.522
<i>Roger that.</i>

00:35.161 --> 00:36.495
Go! Go!

00:54.805 --> 00:57.892
Oi, keep us moving
but stay off the main routes.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.352
We followed the plan exactly.

01:00.352 --> 01:02.521
- How did they know?
- I don't know. I'll call her.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.526
Liam, Mirabelle?

01:07.526 --> 01:08.444
What happened?

01:08.444 --> 01:12.782
Parker, we did everything right,
but the job went bad.

01:34.470 --> 01:39.183
Astrid Pickford
messing with my plans. Bollocks!

01:41.977 --> 01:43.479
Did they take anything?

01:43.479 --> 01:44.396
No, Mr. Dunbar.

01:44.396 --> 01:46.816
Everything here
and in the restoration room is intact.

01:46.816 --> 01:48.734
Well, it's Doctor,
and thank you, Inspector Pickford.

01:48.734 --> 01:50.319
Your tip clearly paid off.

01:50.319 --> 01:51.654
I don't assume
we'll have any more problems?

01:51.654 --> 01:55.825
Doctor, I practically grew up
in this museum and if you think I'm done

01:55.825 --> 01:59.537
investigating a threat against it,
then you are sorely mistaken.

01:59.537 --> 02:00.830
Now if you'll excuse me.

02:29.233 --> 02:31.360
Eliot! My stuff!

02:31.360 --> 02:33.904
That is very funny coming from you.

02:33.904 --> 02:36.031
What is my travel bag doing here?

02:36.031 --> 02:37.700
I just grabbed the essentials.

02:37.700 --> 02:39.660
Therein lies the problem, Parker.
The grabbing.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.412
What is up with Parker?

02:41.412 --> 02:43.247
She's just mad the London team
got blown and wants us

02:43.247 --> 02:45.082
to find out what happened.

02:45.082 --> 02:47.543
Mirabelle said the plan was flawless,
so was the execution.

02:47.543 --> 02:49.545
Now our guys are underground.

02:49.545 --> 02:50.796
Well, something went wrong.

02:50.796 --> 02:53.132
No, they weren't chased out
of the museum by rent-a-cops,

02:53.132 --> 02:54.174
it was Interpol.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.218
I've been on the phone all day
with the international teams

02:56.218 --> 02:58.846
and now they wanna come
to London and punch next.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.139
So you broke into my place?

03:00.139 --> 03:02.808
No, she broke into all our places.

03:02.808 --> 03:04.935
But I didn't steal anything this time.

03:04.935 --> 03:06.312
I just packed your stuff.

03:06.312 --> 03:09.690
 That is not--wait. This time?

03:09.690 --> 03:12.067
 Have you broken
into my apartment before?

03:12.067 --> 03:13.903
Once when you stopped answering texts.

03:13.903 --> 03:15.362
Was I asleep?

03:15.362 --> 03:17.281
Yes. For hours.

03:17.281 --> 03:18.616
What was the job?

03:19.491 --> 03:22.620
The Rhodesian scepter
was taken from the royal family

03:22.620 --> 03:24.705
of modern-day Zambia
when the British colonized them.

03:24.705 --> 03:27.207
 Let me guess,
the museum doesn't wanna give it back?

03:27.207 --> 03:29.084
Well, here's the thing.
The team was hired by a proxy

03:29.084 --> 03:30.544
for the Zambian royal family.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.588
They vetted him, everything checked out,

03:32.588 --> 03:34.131
but the proxy has since disappeared

03:34.131 --> 03:36.133
and the Zambian royal family
knows nothing about it.

03:36.133 --> 03:38.218
 Which means anyone
could have hired them to break

03:38.218 --> 03:39.803
into the Monarch Museum.

03:39.803 --> 03:41.972
Did you say the Monarch Museum?

03:41.972 --> 03:43.432
Mm-hmm.

03:44.266 --> 03:46.435
Okay. We're going to London.

03:46.435 --> 03:49.688
- Dammit.
- We just have to make a pit stop first.

03:51.065 --> 03:52.775
 Hey.

03:52.775 --> 03:54.610
Mm-hmm.

03:54.610 --> 03:56.278
You got a terrific case here.

03:56.278 --> 04:00.032
You're one witness' false testimony away
from a major path for your client.

04:00.032 --> 04:02.785
There's plenty of ways around a witness--
I mean, a witness' testimony.

04:02.785 --> 04:06.413
Well, we have dozens of cases
more just as worthy of your expertise.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.626
Well, what can I say other than
I'm very flattered

04:10.626 --> 04:12.670
and I'm very interested in your offer.

04:12.670 --> 04:14.046
Fantastic.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.006
Looking forward to hearing from you.

04:16.006 --> 04:16.924
- All right then.
- All right.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.300
You take care.

04:21.929 --> 04:25.224
Why do I even bother
trying to keep a secret from you?

04:25.224 --> 04:26.433
I haven't the foggiest.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.143
I wasn't sure if that was a real
offer or not.

04:28.143 --> 04:29.520
- But it's real?
- It's real.

04:31.105 --> 04:33.565
You were the one who told me
I'd always go back to it.

04:33.565 --> 04:34.817
And they need me.

04:36.860 --> 04:38.195
I understand.

04:39.321 --> 04:42.658
I need you too. One last job.

04:42.658 --> 04:45.202
Remember that conversation
we had about collateral damage?

04:45.202 --> 04:46.412
Mm-hmm.

04:46.412 --> 04:49.081
I'm about to go swimming
through a ton of mine.

04:49.081 --> 04:51.959
- Mm-hmm.
- I'll fill you in on the way to London.

04:51.959 --> 04:55.170
London? Okay. I guess
I better go home and pack a bag.

04:55.170 --> 04:57.297
Mm-mm. That won't be necessary.

05:05.597 --> 05:07.182
<i>After the London team's
failed heist,</i>

05:07.182 --> 05:10.060
<i>Interpol shut down the museum's Wi-Fi
out of precaution.</i>

05:10.060 --> 05:13.063
Smart, I guess.
This place is an absolute maze.

05:15.024 --> 05:17.901
Whoa! It survived the London Blitz?

05:17.901 --> 05:21.947
Parts of it. The Monarch Museum
was built on the remains.

05:21.947 --> 05:26.243
There were tons of walled-off
back passages and ancient boiler rooms

05:26.243 --> 05:28.370
<i>littered beneath us.</i>

05:28.370 --> 05:31.999
Whoever is in charge
of Interpol is not messing around.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.209
Not only did they cut the Wi-Fi,

05:34.209 --> 05:37.129
they got plain clothed agents
on every floor

05:37.129 --> 05:39.548
and you wouldn't even be able to tell.

05:39.548 --> 05:41.216
<i>Parker, focus.</i>

05:41.216 --> 05:43.469
There's a dozen things within arms' reach

05:43.469 --> 05:46.472
as valuable
and easier to steal than that scepter.

05:47.681 --> 05:51.268
Not counting the jewels of India
exhibit which hasn't even opened yet.

05:53.604 --> 05:54.438
Are you okay?

05:54.438 --> 05:59.026
I'm fine. It's just this place,
it's full of ghosts.

05:59.026 --> 06:02.196
Yeah, I can imagine.
The Hanover Gallery, as in...

06:02.196 --> 06:05.824
I suggested
that he donate the gallery to house

06:05.824 --> 06:07.284
his family collection

06:07.284 --> 06:11.038
and also, a state of the
art restoration facility.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.874
Which appears to be
the scene of the crime.

06:13.874 --> 06:14.792
Who's the suit?

06:14.792 --> 06:16.877
I don't have all day.
Step away from the art!

06:16.877 --> 06:20.589
Given the tweedy impertinence,
I'd say he's the museum curator.

06:20.589 --> 06:23.467
The restoration room
was the London team's target.

06:23.467 --> 06:25.010
We need to get inside.

06:25.010 --> 06:27.930
Right. Breanna,
can you get me and Parker in?

06:28.514 --> 06:30.724
With the Wi-Fi down,
I'm gonna need physical access

06:30.724 --> 06:32.184
to the building's wiring.

06:32.184 --> 06:34.103
<i>Physical access, huh?</i>

06:34.103 --> 06:36.480
<i>Sounds like a me problem.</i>

06:42.361 --> 06:43.529
Breanna, turn on your flash.

06:43.529 --> 06:46.615
<i>Copy that.</i>

06:58.335 --> 07:01.922
Miss, there's no flash photography
in the museum.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.882
Man, it's like mad dim in here.

07:03.882 --> 07:05.717
How am I supposed
to post it online, you feel?

07:05.717 --> 07:07.845
Do you have any idea
what you're doing to that painting?

07:07.845 --> 07:11.932
Every time your flash goes off,
you are stabbing the paint molecules

07:11.932 --> 07:14.101
with tiny, tiny daggers, okay?

07:14.101 --> 07:15.602
Sir, there's no use
for that kind of behavior.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.062
She's offending
the painting, okay?

07:17.062 --> 07:17.980
Sir, sir, there's no need
for that kind of behavior.

07:17.980 --> 07:19.398
I--go back to your digital world, okay?

07:19.398 --> 07:21.567
And leave the real world to us.

07:23.318 --> 07:27.281
Sure. Man is a mad thing, you know.

07:32.828 --> 07:33.996
Dammit, Breanna.

07:33.996 --> 07:36.039
If I take a guy's badge,
you don't start messing around

07:36.039 --> 07:38.041
with his chest area,
it makes him look down.

07:38.041 --> 07:39.334
He was cute.

07:41.128 --> 07:44.548
This plumbing looks like it hadn't
been updated since the Blitz either.

07:48.886 --> 07:50.637
Dang it.

07:50.637 --> 07:53.640
They have some sort of pin lock
on the security system.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.143
You know, I'm gonna have a word
with this Interpol agent in charge.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.061
What's the bottom line?

07:58.061 --> 08:00.939
Okay. Cameras, I can hijack,
they're on a separate feed.

08:00.939 --> 08:05.277
But alarms and security...
maybe if I had a week.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.738
No, careful--if that trips,
that is gonna--

08:14.036 --> 08:17.664
Yep. Yeah, that--that's one way
to do that.

08:18.540 --> 08:20.125
It's in the Impressionist exhibit.

08:20.125 --> 08:22.628
Second floor, east wing. Come on.

08:22.628 --> 08:24.796
We're on it. They won't get far.

08:31.762 --> 08:33.180
All right.

08:33.180 --> 08:34.973
How much time will this buy us?

08:34.973 --> 08:37.476
Uh, about five to ten minutes.

08:37.476 --> 08:40.062
You should stay here in case
they come back.

08:41.563 --> 08:42.731
Oh!

08:45.609 --> 08:47.819
Thank you, kind guard.

08:47.819 --> 08:49.613
They're just giving these away.

09:15.806 --> 09:16.890
Here.

09:18.517 --> 09:22.562
Huh. Well, it's pretty but I don't know
why someone would go

09:22.562 --> 09:24.648
to the trouble to have us steal it.

09:25.691 --> 09:29.236
I don't think they did.
This isn't about the scepter.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.280
This is about these.

09:31.280 --> 09:33.657
Marble masks, hand-carved.

09:33.657 --> 09:35.200
Greek death masks.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.119
Why these over the scepter?

09:37.119 --> 09:39.496
Parker, the London team
were just being used

09:39.496 --> 09:42.457
for a practice run for the real heist.

09:42.457 --> 09:45.377
Someone who wanted
to test the museum's defenses.

09:45.377 --> 09:47.713
And I know who.

09:48.213 --> 09:49.047
Ramsey.

09:49.047 --> 09:50.757
Wait, Ramsey? You mean...

09:50.757 --> 09:52.050
<i>My first mentor.</i>

09:52.050 --> 09:54.052
Brilliant but terrifying, remember?

09:54.052 --> 09:58.640
He forged one of these masks,
30 years ago.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.018
Hmm. Which one?

10:01.018 --> 10:03.103
So he wants it back now?
That doesn't make any sense.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.980
No, I don't like it. Let's blow.

10:04.980 --> 10:07.316
Small problem.
The curator's coming back.

10:07.316 --> 10:08.817
<i>Stall them.</i>

10:09.985 --> 10:11.278
You took them off their post?

10:11.278 --> 10:12.863
Yes, it was an actual alarm.

10:12.863 --> 10:15.282
You know,
this tape and the police it, uh--

10:15.282 --> 10:17.284
well, it just scares the paying guests.

10:17.284 --> 10:20.746
Excuse me.
Lawrence Gesterton, IYS Insurance.

10:20.746 --> 10:22.873
Maybe I can be of little assistance.

10:22.873 --> 10:24.916
Harry. No, no, no, no.

10:24.916 --> 10:27.127
You need to be dismissive,

10:27.127 --> 10:29.921
uh, unapproachable, mean even.

10:29.921 --> 10:31.715
You're telling him to be Nate?

10:31.715 --> 10:33.925
I'm telling him to be about the money.

10:33.925 --> 10:37.387
I mean, I assume that this display
of manpower

10:37.387 --> 10:39.848
won't have any effect
on the upcoming Jewels of India exhibit

10:39.848 --> 10:42.225
that my firm insures,
we'd hate to have to pull the show.

10:42.225 --> 10:44.436
Dr. Phineas Dunbar,
curator of the Monarch Museum.

10:44.436 --> 10:46.063
I can assure you, everything is fine.

10:46.063 --> 10:47.731
- So these officers...
- Yes.

10:47.731 --> 10:52.319
The presence of police is simply overkill
on part of one Interpol inspector.

10:52.319 --> 10:55.447
- There was a robbery.
- Attempted. Nothing was taken.

10:55.447 --> 10:58.283
Criminals who operate at this level
don't take failure in stride,

10:58.283 --> 10:59.618
they'll try again.

10:59.618 --> 11:02.829
Perhaps then you could walk me through
some of the security upgrades

11:02.829 --> 11:04.122
that you've implemented.

11:04.915 --> 11:07.042
Right.

11:07.042 --> 11:11.421
The next time IYS send an errand boy,
tell them Inspector Astrid Pickford

11:11.421 --> 11:13.048
knows all their tricks.

11:13.048 --> 11:14.633
Astrid Pickford?

11:16.009 --> 11:17.677
We need to go, now.

11:20.263 --> 11:22.557
Sophie. Come on.
Get your head in the game.

11:23.558 --> 11:26.269
Parker. No. No.

11:34.194 --> 11:37.364
This is my friend's joint.
It's under renovation.

11:37.364 --> 11:42.160
All the exits are secured.
Now, who is Inspector Astrid Pickford?

11:42.160 --> 11:44.996
Astrid Pickford, Interpol,
she once chased me

11:44.996 --> 11:47.833
and Hardison across Europe.
Do you know how long Europe is?

11:47.833 --> 11:50.419
Anyways, she considers me a nemesis,
which I understand.

11:50.419 --> 11:51.920
I have a lot of nemesiseses.

11:51.920 --> 11:54.381
I just don't have time to nemesis
them all back.

11:54.381 --> 11:57.259
No. Sophie, who is Astrid Pickford to you?

12:01.430 --> 12:06.601
She's the Duke of Hanover's daughter
and my stepdaughter.

12:18.155 --> 12:22.159
Wait. Astrid Pickford, Interpol agent,

12:22.159 --> 12:24.202
- is your stepdaughter?
- Yup.

12:24.202 --> 12:26.663
It turns out having your father
robbed blind by grifters

12:26.663 --> 12:30.375
and then watching him drink himself
to death is a formative experience.

12:30.375 --> 12:33.336
Uh, have you known this whole time
that she was my nemesis?

12:33.336 --> 12:34.629
Has she known this whole time?

12:34.629 --> 12:37.257
Is that why we're drawn to each other,
battling across continents?

12:37.257 --> 12:38.550
Hey, I thought you were her nemesis,
not the other way?

12:38.550 --> 12:41.094
- Shush.
- The point is,

12:41.094 --> 12:42.762
can she recognize you?

12:43.346 --> 12:44.723
I don't know.

12:44.723 --> 12:48.852
It's been 20 years.
Though I have kept tabs on her.

12:48.852 --> 12:52.439
She's really quite brilliant at her job,

12:52.439 --> 12:56.735
tenacious, always was.
Though, I have dropped her the odd clue

12:56.735 --> 13:00.655
and might have nudged a deserving
criminal in her path now and then.

13:00.655 --> 13:03.492
What? You have helped my nemesis,
my not-nemesis?

13:03.492 --> 13:05.911
This goes against every oath
you've ever taken as a criminal.

13:05.911 --> 13:07.496
Parker.
What about Ramsey?

13:07.496 --> 13:08.580
Not much to tell.

13:08.580 --> 13:11.583
He discovered my talents early on,
he molded me,

13:11.583 --> 13:13.585
and that made him think he owned me.

13:13.585 --> 13:17.964
I burned every bridge
I had getting away from him,

13:17.964 --> 13:22.135
leaving behind a marriage
and a stepdaughter.

13:22.135 --> 13:25.138
See? You say there's not much to tell,
but that was kind of a lot.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.390
So hiring a Leverage crew
was not a coincidence.

13:27.390 --> 13:29.809
And Astrid being on the case
isn't a coincidence either.

13:29.809 --> 13:33.396
No, that was Ramsey setting a trap
and I walked straight into it.

13:33.396 --> 13:35.941
Okay. Do you want to walk out of it?

13:35.941 --> 13:37.275
No, she can't.

13:37.275 --> 13:40.028
Because Ramsey will just keep coming
after her, trying to get her attention.

13:40.028 --> 13:41.613
And with Astrid still there...

13:41.613 --> 13:43.406
Collateral damage.

13:43.406 --> 13:46.409
Ramsey is a loose end I can't afford
to have out there.

13:46.409 --> 13:47.619
Not anymore.

13:47.619 --> 13:50.539
We need to stop him
before he hurts anyone else.

13:51.122 --> 13:52.165
Sophie, what's the play?

13:52.165 --> 13:55.126
We know that Ramsey
wants his forged mask back,

13:55.126 --> 13:56.503
we just have to find out why.

13:56.503 --> 13:59.256
Well, we can't just waltz
into the museum and ask questions.

13:59.256 --> 14:02.634
No, but we can recruit from the outside.

14:08.682 --> 14:12.352
I've never been early before.

14:15.438 --> 14:16.606
You're not, Billy.

14:16.606 --> 14:18.900
I can't help you.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.652
Billy, I thought we were friends.

14:20.652 --> 14:22.153
I don't have any friends.

14:22.153 --> 14:23.530
Yeah, how about enemies?

14:25.115 --> 14:27.284
The heist at the museum.

14:27.284 --> 14:29.119
Well, I don't know anything
about that.

14:31.746 --> 14:32.914
You haven't heard anything about it?

14:35.458 --> 14:38.128
Okay. I've heard everything about it.

14:38.128 --> 14:40.046
Ramsey. It was why I pulled out
when it failed.

14:40.046 --> 14:43.174
Why does Ramsey
want his forged mask back so badly?

14:43.174 --> 14:45.218
Because the museum
is selling the whole lot back

14:45.218 --> 14:46.344
to the Greek government.

14:46.344 --> 14:49.556
So to land on a price,
the mask have to be re-authenticated.

14:49.556 --> 14:52.017
And I'm guessing
that 30-year-old forge is not gonna

14:52.017 --> 14:55.312
stand up to authentication
technology at this day and age.

14:55.312 --> 14:58.064
So one forgery gets outed,
what's the big deal?

14:59.441 --> 15:00.984
You don't understand.

15:00.984 --> 15:03.361
Ramsey moved his mask
into the legitimate market

15:03.361 --> 15:05.614
by the same methods
he moved all of his work.

15:05.614 --> 15:09.618
So if one person gets exposed,
everybody falls like dominoes.

15:09.618 --> 15:11.703
And a bunch of art people
across Europe will realize

15:11.703 --> 15:13.163
they have fakes in their collection.

15:13.163 --> 15:15.248
Not art people, rich people.

15:15.248 --> 15:19.294
Kind of money they don't care if Ramsey
gets prosecuted or executed.

15:19.294 --> 15:20.337
For that matter.

15:20.337 --> 15:23.715
The stakes are life
and death for Ramsey.

15:23.715 --> 15:26.301
- I can work with that.
- What do you mean?

15:26.301 --> 15:30.138
Arthur told you what my team
and I are capable of.

15:30.138 --> 15:34.726
I am taking Ramsey down
and you are going to help me.

15:34.726 --> 15:36.353
Why would I do that?

15:36.353 --> 15:38.521
Ramsey's been my meal ticket for decades.

15:38.521 --> 15:41.775
And did you ever enjoy a full meal,
or did he just toss you

15:41.775 --> 15:43.610
the odd table scrap?

15:43.610 --> 15:46.321
I did you a good time with your daughter

15:46.321 --> 15:49.240
and I didn't even get upset
when I learned your real motives.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.326
You owe me.

15:51.326 --> 15:53.203
I am going after Ramsey.

15:55.330 --> 15:57.332
And I'm gonna win.

15:57.332 --> 16:01.127
Whose side do you wanna be on
when the dust settles?

16:05.924 --> 16:08.093
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

16:10.095 --> 16:11.471
I'm in.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.015
What's the plan?

16:14.015 --> 16:15.850
We have to lure Ramsey
out of hiding.

16:15.850 --> 16:17.227
But first things first...

16:17.227 --> 16:19.020
We got to clear Astrid out.

16:19.020 --> 16:22.023
She's too good at what she does
and that's a complication we don't need.

16:22.023 --> 16:26.111
You mean your little girl?
Oh, that is so nice when families reunite.

16:27.570 --> 16:31.616
Parker, what did you steal
that made Astrid chase you across Europe?

16:31.616 --> 16:33.284
One of my favorite
Rembrandt self-portraits.

16:33.284 --> 16:35.078
Funny little hat.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.204
Why?

16:36.204 --> 16:38.248
Every day,
you and your people are here,

16:38.248 --> 16:40.083
you're making my customers nervous.

16:40.083 --> 16:43.253
Did you know? The Indian Jewels exhibit
pre-sales plummeted.

16:43.253 --> 16:45.547
Excuse me. I'm so sorry to interrupt.
Inspector, I just got a ping.

16:45.547 --> 16:48.091
Apparently, a stolen Rembrandt
has surfaced in Berlin.

16:48.091 --> 16:50.719
A note was left at the scene addressed
to you from the thief.

16:52.846 --> 16:54.431
Parker?

16:54.431 --> 16:55.473
The Parker?

16:55.473 --> 16:57.225
Apparently, she's calling you out.

16:57.225 --> 16:59.853
Perhaps, she considers you
some sort of nemesis.

17:00.937 --> 17:03.148
Imagine if you were to catch her.

17:03.148 --> 17:06.317
Get the team together.
Red Bull, new priority.

17:06.317 --> 17:07.777
Copy that.
Right away, ma'am.

17:07.777 --> 17:10.321
Excuse me. No liquids in my museum.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.825
She took the bait.
She'll be wheels up in half an hour.

17:13.825 --> 17:16.536
- Okay. Faked your credentials.
- Oh.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.997
And here's your stolen badge
from yesterday.

17:18.997 --> 17:21.166
Good. All right.
We'll get into the restoration room.

17:21.166 --> 17:24.294
You're on guard, schedules,
and exit routes, all right?

17:28.131 --> 17:29.340
What the...

17:31.551 --> 17:32.844
- Excuse me?
- I thought Harry said

17:32.844 --> 17:34.929
she took the bait?
How could she not take the bait?

17:36.473 --> 17:38.516
Excuse me?

17:38.516 --> 17:41.686
Haven't I seen you before
here at the museum?

17:42.187 --> 17:44.689
What kind of nemesis is she trying
to be...

17:46.357 --> 17:49.569
It is possible. I, I am here often.

17:49.569 --> 17:54.699
Amina Farid.
I am restoration expert from Dubai.

17:54.699 --> 17:56.242
Astrid Pickford.

17:57.160 --> 17:59.954
You of course know we're trying to keep
traffic in the gallery to a minimum

17:59.954 --> 18:01.206
for now?

18:01.206 --> 18:05.794
Apologies. Uh, the robbery attempt,
it disrupted my work.

18:05.794 --> 18:08.922
Uh, a set of Greek death masks.

18:08.922 --> 18:12.967
Please, may I enter the restoration room
just for a minute?

18:12.967 --> 18:15.595
I, I have the paperwork.

18:20.266 --> 18:24.270
Dr. Dunbar, I was just upstairs and I saw
that the inspector is still here.

18:24.270 --> 18:25.814
Noticed that too, huh?

18:25.814 --> 18:28.566
Doctor, out of curiosity, and for my file,

18:28.566 --> 18:31.152
how was Interpol
able to thwart the attempted heist?

18:31.152 --> 18:33.154
Hmm, an anonymous tip,
as I understand,

18:33.154 --> 18:35.448
telling her that some thief
by the name of Ramsey

18:35.448 --> 18:37.075
was gonna come and rob the museum.

18:37.075 --> 18:39.577
Now we can't seem
to get our inspector to leave.

18:41.162 --> 18:42.747
You're very dedicated to your work.

18:42.747 --> 18:46.376
Just trying to protect
what I love.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.503
The art, that is.

18:48.503 --> 18:52.549
- Right.
- You also are dedicated.

18:52.549 --> 18:55.343
Well, you protect what you love your way
and I protect it mine.

18:55.343 --> 18:57.804
And how is that, may I ask?

18:57.804 --> 19:00.098
By taking down
those who would destroy it.

19:00.098 --> 19:04.018
I've been called overzealous,
hunting and studying criminals.

19:04.018 --> 19:06.271
I guess I wanted to know how they thought.

19:06.271 --> 19:07.605
If they feel.

19:07.605 --> 19:10.149
You are very strong.

19:10.149 --> 19:13.152
I've had to be.
One of these people destroyed my life.

19:13.987 --> 19:17.198
I am sorry for you.

19:17.782 --> 19:21.244
Don't be. I'm going to remind them
of it just before I return the favor.

19:21.995 --> 19:24.497
I am sorry.
I--I won't be able to let you in.

19:24.497 --> 19:25.957
I hope you understand.

19:25.957 --> 19:28.293
But don't worry, your masks
will be safe with me.

19:33.923 --> 19:36.175
You know,
even if we clear out that whole museum,

19:36.175 --> 19:37.719
there's no way
Astrid's gonna leave the floor.

19:37.719 --> 19:39.262
She wants Ramsey bad.

19:39.262 --> 19:42.181
Can I pitch kidnapping now?
Kidnapping is a good idea.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.766
Oh, you just wanna kidnap your nemesis.

19:43.766 --> 19:46.352
And Sophie's not gonna like
this but it might be the best way.

19:46.352 --> 19:47.896
She's a danger to you.

19:47.896 --> 19:52.525
No, for my plan to work,
Astrid has to remain un-kidnapped.

19:52.525 --> 19:53.735
We have a plan?

19:53.735 --> 19:56.696
Yes. We need to get Ramsey
into the restoration room.

19:56.696 --> 19:59.324
And how are we gonna do
that with Astrid guarding all the angles?

19:59.324 --> 20:01.910
Well, she won't move away
from the restoration room,

20:01.910 --> 20:05.246
then we have to move
the restoration room away from her.

20:05.246 --> 20:08.833
Let's go steal a museum gallery.

20:08.833 --> 20:09.876
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.836
Cheerio.

20:17.258 --> 20:20.011
<i>Here's the mountain
in front of us.</i>

20:20.845 --> 20:25.475
<i>We need to get Ramsey into the museum
and up to the restoration room unseen.</i>

20:25.475 --> 20:27.727
<i>Meanwhile, Astrid and her team,</i>

20:27.727 --> 20:31.606
<i>they have the Hanover Gallery
and the restoration room fully covered,</i>

20:31.606 --> 20:33.274
so we can't run a con from up there.

20:33.274 --> 20:35.610
However, the layout of the third floor

20:35.610 --> 20:39.322
is exactly the same as the floor above it,
minus a wall or two,

20:39.322 --> 20:42.784
including an unused storage room
directly below the restoration room.

20:42.784 --> 20:45.662
And Astrid does not have eyes on that.

20:45.662 --> 20:46.871
Foolish mortal.

20:46.871 --> 20:49.207
All right. All we gotta do basically
is clear out the museum,

20:49.207 --> 20:51.417
hide some masterworks,
do a little masonry,

20:51.417 --> 20:54.087
basically build an entire gallery
and restoration room.

20:54.087 --> 20:55.171
Uh, and quick question.

20:55.171 --> 20:56.798
How are we gonna get Ramsey
into the museum?

20:56.798 --> 20:59.717
Doesn't he live off the grid,
hidden in the shadow?

20:59.717 --> 21:02.345
Just gonna call him up and say,
"Hey, we found your forged mask."

21:02.345 --> 21:04.639
Well, not me.

21:06.641 --> 21:08.726
No, no. I don't like it.

21:08.726 --> 21:11.145
- It doesn't make any sense.
- Of course it does, Billy.

21:11.145 --> 21:13.231
And the whole thing depends on you.

21:15.483 --> 21:17.819
That's the part that doesn't make sense.

21:18.444 --> 21:21.030
And, you know,
you ruined my poker game again.

21:21.030 --> 21:23.282
I can't go getting
in touch with Ramsey, can I?

21:23.282 --> 21:24.409
But you can.

21:24.409 --> 21:26.786
All you have to do is tell him
you can get him into the museum...

21:26.786 --> 21:29.414
With the roses all over him?
The man's never gonna believe it.

21:29.414 --> 21:32.166
But you don't know
which mask is his forgery.

21:32.166 --> 21:34.711
And I don't, do I?
I mean, at least that much is the truth.

21:34.711 --> 21:37.338
Yes. So he has to show up
to identify it.

21:37.338 --> 21:39.757
And when he shows up to the museum,

21:39.757 --> 21:43.177
we'll have him in a locked room
with Interpol just a few steps away.

21:43.177 --> 21:46.055
All you have to do is escort him in,
we'll do the rest.

21:46.055 --> 21:48.891
There's only a thousand things
that can go wrong with your plan.

21:48.891 --> 21:50.768
And I'm 999 of them.

21:50.768 --> 21:54.313
Ramsey's not gonna set foot
in a place if he sees a soul.

21:54.939 --> 21:56.941
How are you gonna clear out
the entire museum?

21:59.527 --> 22:01.070
I don't know.

22:01.070 --> 22:04.365
The office said someone called
about the pipes down here again.

22:05.408 --> 22:09.328
And they're really old and...

22:12.206 --> 22:15.835
Susan, I'll call you back.
I just found a bomb.

22:17.545 --> 22:21.507
Everyone, please remain calm.
We have the situation under control.

22:23.009 --> 22:26.012
It's an unexploded
German ordnance from the Blitz.

22:26.012 --> 22:27.680
We sent the robot down
and it took a reading.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.516
Fifty kilograms, fuse intact.

22:30.516 --> 22:32.727
It's called a blast bomb.

22:33.853 --> 22:36.481
Dude, you having a World War II
German ordnance guy,

22:36.481 --> 22:39.275
so on brand, but wow.

22:39.275 --> 22:41.652
We should evacuate the museum.
Yes, Captain?

22:41.652 --> 22:43.821
No. Not the entire building.

22:43.821 --> 22:45.073
Uh, only for an hour,

22:45.073 --> 22:47.325
so we can safely remove
the device from the premises.

22:47.325 --> 22:50.995
It's yield will likely be very low,
if it explodes at all.

22:50.995 --> 22:52.705
I'll take my chances.

22:54.832 --> 22:56.417
No, careful with that.

22:56.417 --> 22:57.877
We've got one hour.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.629
That's not nearly enough time.

23:00.254 --> 23:01.672
We can't recreate the restoration room

23:01.672 --> 23:04.217
and the entire Hanover Gallery
in one hour.

23:05.635 --> 23:07.428
Yeah, Eliot.

23:07.428 --> 23:08.596
What do you mean, "Yeah, Eliot?"

23:08.596 --> 23:10.014
<i>Don't forget
about his ordnance guy.</i>

23:10.014 --> 23:12.433
Who all's hand went up
when we needed a guy

23:12.433 --> 23:15.353
with an active 80-year-old device
on short notice, huh?

23:15.353 --> 23:16.979
That would come in and ask no questions?

23:16.979 --> 23:19.315
Who, who? Me. I'm the only one.

23:19.315 --> 23:21.943
Where's my EOD tech? Suit up!

23:22.652 --> 23:27.406
Listen, he's asking
for an explosive ordnance disposal,

23:27.406 --> 23:29.075
a <i>Hurt Locker</i> guy.

23:29.075 --> 23:32.703
Does anybody have any ideas? Huh? No?

23:32.703 --> 23:34.205
No hands go up again?

24:18.708 --> 24:21.043
Captain, there's a second payload
on the bomb.

24:21.043 --> 24:23.296
<i>It's potentially a massive yield.</i>

24:23.296 --> 24:25.339
No. That sounds more South African.

24:25.339 --> 24:27.216
It's--it's massive.

24:27.216 --> 24:31.053
Not massive. It's tremor.

24:31.053 --> 24:33.890
- Huh?
- <i>Tremor.</i>

24:33.890 --> 24:35.057
What?

24:35.057 --> 24:38.436
Captain, there's a second payload
on the bomb and it's potentially...

24:38.436 --> 24:40.771
Now you just sound
like Scotty talking to Kirk.

24:40.771 --> 24:43.941
"I can't change
the laws of physics, Captain."

24:43.941 --> 24:46.777
Stop. I--let me get through
the whole thing be...

24:46.777 --> 24:48.487
<i>Robot...</i>

24:48.487 --> 24:52.283
...wrong... dummy explosion...

24:52.283 --> 24:54.577
Shh. Quiet.

24:54.577 --> 24:56.204
Second payload.

24:57.371 --> 24:59.582
<i>Potentially a massive yield.</i>

24:59.582 --> 25:02.710
The slightest tremor could set it off.

25:02.710 --> 25:04.253
<i>Captain, this won't be quick.</i>

25:05.046 --> 25:06.047
Right.

25:06.047 --> 25:09.967
Everyone needs to clear
the building cool and quiet.

25:09.967 --> 25:12.470
EOD will stay with the bomb.

25:14.597 --> 25:19.060
<i>Thinks he can bypass the second fuse,
but it may take several hours if not days.</i>

25:19.060 --> 25:21.938
And Captain, tell the lads
to say a prayer for me, would you?

25:21.938 --> 25:23.272
<i>Yeah. You've got it, old boy.</i>

25:25.524 --> 25:26.734
Cover everything.

25:26.734 --> 25:29.862
And if they question it,
it's protection from the bomb.

25:51.634 --> 25:52.760
Do you think they'll buy it?

25:52.760 --> 25:54.345
We don't have a plan M.

25:56.180 --> 25:57.807
It's a massive payload.

25:57.807 --> 25:59.600
<i>You might want to clear
the whole block for this one.</i>

25:59.600 --> 26:01.978
And Captain, tell Carla I loved her.

26:02.812 --> 26:03.980
She deserved better.

26:14.115 --> 26:16.575
So the bomb clearing out
in the lobby, that was us.

26:16.575 --> 26:19.578
Nothing I didn't figure out
for myself, but well done.

26:19.578 --> 26:22.039
You always was good at bringing
in talent, my old son,

26:22.039 --> 26:24.041
even though you never have
much yourself, to be honest.

26:24.041 --> 26:25.626
<i>I'm shocked I'm this close
with you at the wheel.</i>

26:27.253 --> 26:28.379
Keep cool, Billy.

26:28.379 --> 26:29.964
<i>Stay focused.</i>

26:29.964 --> 26:31.465
I don't know.

26:31.465 --> 26:33.718
This feels off.
It's smaller than I remember.

26:33.718 --> 26:36.345
Uh, you've grown bigger,

26:36.345 --> 26:40.558
uh, is, uh, your influence has grown.

26:42.059 --> 26:43.811
Don't let him get under your skin.

26:43.811 --> 26:45.146
He's too suspicious.

26:45.146 --> 26:47.940
There's still something
nipping at my arse about this place.

26:47.940 --> 26:51.193
Maybe we should,
uh, be a bit quick about it?

26:51.193 --> 26:54.196
You watch who you're talking to.

26:56.032 --> 26:57.033
No.

26:57.742 --> 26:59.160
There's something off here.

26:59.910 --> 27:02.038
And you're walking me down a path.

27:03.789 --> 27:05.916
What's waiting for me
down there, you mug?

27:05.916 --> 27:07.793
There's nothing.

27:07.793 --> 27:09.587
<i>I--I swear.</i>

27:09.587 --> 27:10.963
He's gonna blow the whole thing.

27:10.963 --> 27:12.882
Billy, mate,

27:12.882 --> 27:15.843
it's not a good idea to lie to me.

27:17.678 --> 27:20.264
Nah. Screw it. I'm done.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.062
My, my.

27:26.062 --> 27:27.521
Hello, Ramsey.

27:34.236 --> 27:36.238
Not quite what you were expecting.

27:36.238 --> 27:39.533
I'd expect nothing less
from my favorite protégé.

27:40.451 --> 27:42.495
Didn't think I'd be pleased
to see you, did you?

27:42.495 --> 27:44.372
I was never your protégé.

27:44.372 --> 27:46.499
You were never handing me the reins.

27:46.499 --> 27:48.709
In fact, you taught me
all the wrong things.

27:48.709 --> 27:50.336
I taught you how to survive.

27:50.336 --> 27:52.213
How to survive you.

27:52.213 --> 27:55.633
Obviously it worked,
because here you are, standing there.

27:55.633 --> 27:58.386
Not for a reunion, for a job,

27:59.553 --> 28:03.140
which I swooped in to pull off
just like you wanted.

28:03.140 --> 28:05.184
But make no mistake.

28:05.184 --> 28:09.021
I'm here for one reason, self-protection.

28:09.855 --> 28:12.483
Those masks get uncovered,

28:12.483 --> 28:14.902
it's bad for the whole crew, not just you.

28:18.948 --> 28:21.951
Well, why didn't you tell me
you was back in the game?

28:23.828 --> 28:26.247
We could have been doing
business all this time.

28:28.666 --> 28:30.876
The masks
are just straight ahead.

28:30.876 --> 28:32.461
I heard Lady Astrid
was on the case.

28:33.921 --> 28:36.882
I hope you didn't do anything
too drastic to remove her.

28:36.882 --> 28:39.301
I just put her onto a warmer trail.

28:39.301 --> 28:42.346
And despite any fancy you may have,

28:42.346 --> 28:44.557
you're hardly on the top
of her most wanted list.

28:45.474 --> 28:46.392
Hang on.

28:46.392 --> 28:49.061
Why is he suddenly sweating? Eh, Billy?

28:49.061 --> 28:50.813
What are you hiding, princess?

28:50.813 --> 28:51.939
Nothing.

28:51.939 --> 28:54.900
You know Billy, he's always been clammy.

28:54.900 --> 28:58.362
And isn't there a portrait of you
somewhere in this gallery, right up here?

28:58.362 --> 28:59.905
Portrait?

28:59.905 --> 29:01.115
What portrait?

29:01.115 --> 29:02.658
Look, we should really get moving.

29:02.658 --> 29:05.995
Yeah. Please, Ramsey.
This--there is not--there's nothing there.

29:15.171 --> 29:16.964
Hardison loves
this printer so much.

29:16.964 --> 29:19.258
He made one
for all the international crews.

29:19.592 --> 29:22.011
My big brother's version
of arts and crafts.

29:22.011 --> 29:24.221
So within the realm of cool.

29:25.055 --> 29:26.807
So paranoid.

29:26.807 --> 29:28.309
<i>Can we move on now?</i>

29:28.309 --> 29:29.685
Got to hand it to you, Sophie.

29:29.685 --> 29:32.104
You knew exactly
which painting he'd go for.

29:42.406 --> 29:44.366
I swear I heard something.

29:45.576 --> 29:46.911
False alarm.

30:11.018 --> 30:12.937
I studied these for so long.

30:12.937 --> 30:15.189
I started dreaming about them,

30:15.189 --> 30:18.400
obsessed with making the perfect copy.

30:18.400 --> 30:21.028
And there he is, greatest ever forgery.

30:21.028 --> 30:22.738
Next to you of course.

30:22.738 --> 30:25.449
I was never one of your charades.

30:25.449 --> 30:27.159
You only see what you wanna see.

30:27.159 --> 30:29.537
The fabrication, not the facts.

30:31.247 --> 30:35.709
You tried to train
all of the feelings out of me,

30:35.709 --> 30:40.005
make me as cold
as one of these marble masks.

30:40.005 --> 30:43.467
But I was never like that.
I was never like you.

30:46.303 --> 30:49.390
Hey, guys, we have some
movement in the third floor hallway.

30:50.266 --> 30:52.643
Yeah. No, no.
Sir, you can assure the board

30:52.643 --> 30:57.481
that the exhibit will definitely open,
uh, just a slight bomb problem.

31:03.279 --> 31:06.448
Ah-ha, Dr. Dunbar.
Thank goodness you're here.

31:06.448 --> 31:08.075
Isn't the museum supposed
to be empty?

31:08.075 --> 31:09.618
What is all of this?
What's going on over there?

31:09.618 --> 31:11.829
Just a little precaution
to protect the paintings

31:11.829 --> 31:14.081
in case the bomb goes off.
We should probably go.

31:14.081 --> 31:15.040
Please.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.750
There's nothing to worry about.

31:16.750 --> 31:19.837
I wouldn't--I wouldn't--
I wouldn't--I wouldn't...

31:19.837 --> 31:21.338
Where are all these works?

31:21.338 --> 31:24.049
Justin, we're being robbed.

31:24.049 --> 31:26.010
We're in the middle
of a robbery right now.

31:26.010 --> 31:27.970
Inspector? Inspector, where are you?

31:27.970 --> 31:30.097
I'm right outside the restoration room.

31:30.806 --> 31:32.182
Restoration room?

31:32.182 --> 31:34.143
Well, no--I mean, no.
Obviously you're not, are you?

31:34.143 --> 31:35.978
Because I am outside
the restoration room.

31:35.978 --> 31:36.979
Hmm?

31:36.979 --> 31:38.439
Oh, my goodness!
How did that happen?

31:38.439 --> 31:39.982
I got you.

31:39.982 --> 31:41.191
- Inspector!
- Sorry if I have to lose those

31:41.191 --> 31:42.901
drop cloths, I got you.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.528
Sophie, we have a little problem.

31:49.700 --> 31:51.410
Help me!

31:51.410 --> 31:53.162
Inspector Pickford!

31:53.162 --> 31:54.663
Pickford's here?

31:54.663 --> 31:56.123
Help!

31:56.123 --> 31:57.875
Inspector Pickford!

31:57.875 --> 32:00.252
Trying to pull a fast one,
are you?

32:00.252 --> 32:02.004
You're more like me than you think.

32:03.005 --> 32:05.215
Oops.

32:05.215 --> 32:07.343
No more forgery you can pin on me.

32:07.343 --> 32:09.887
You old tosser.

32:09.887 --> 32:11.347
Billy!

32:12.348 --> 32:14.558
Time your girl gets here,
I'll be gone.

32:14.558 --> 32:16.894
The only one getting caught here
is you.

32:16.894 --> 32:18.979
Ta-da.

32:19.605 --> 32:20.522
Billy.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.280
This bloody cloth!

32:28.280 --> 32:31.450
Why is nobody helping me? Ow!

32:41.835 --> 32:43.962
<i>All right, Billy. All right.</i>

32:45.130 --> 32:47.007
Ramsey's on the move, Parker.
You know what to do.

32:47.007 --> 32:47.925
<i>On it.</i>

32:47.925 --> 32:49.218
They're gonna catch us.

32:49.802 --> 32:51.887
I'm never gonna see my daughter again.

32:51.887 --> 32:54.640
Billy, we built this room.

32:54.640 --> 32:57.226
That door never locked in the first place.

32:58.394 --> 33:02.272
Look, that was really--
it was chivalrous of you.

33:02.898 --> 33:04.692
We're square. Now go on.

33:04.692 --> 33:06.610
- Don't get caught on the way out.
- Okay.

33:09.279 --> 33:11.281
You know...

33:11.281 --> 33:14.451
...I've never been gladder
to leave you, darling.

33:16.161 --> 33:17.204
It's been fun.

33:19.456 --> 33:22.626
Have them search every floor.
Dunbar sounded weird.

33:22.626 --> 33:24.461
Just find him,
wherever the hell he is.

33:24.461 --> 33:26.046
Right away, ma'am.

33:33.595 --> 33:35.389
- Parker.
- Astrid.

34:11.508 --> 34:12.843
A Greek death mask.

34:14.678 --> 34:16.680
Stop right there.

34:18.015 --> 34:19.099
That's my forgery.

34:22.436 --> 34:25.189
I've been stitched up
good and proper, haven't I?

34:25.189 --> 34:28.859
So continuing Breanna's art forgery hour.

34:28.859 --> 34:33.197
Does anyone besides Ramsey
actually know which death mask is fake?

34:35.324 --> 34:36.700
You only see what you wanna see.

34:36.700 --> 34:38.827
The fabrication, not the facts.

34:38.827 --> 34:41.622
I've been looking for you

34:41.622 --> 34:44.625
ever since you destroyed my father.

34:45.876 --> 34:48.921
Something tells me I'll know exactly
where to find you from now on, Ramsey.

34:50.506 --> 34:51.840
You're under arrest.

34:53.425 --> 34:56.512
Here comes the hero. Great work!

34:58.430 --> 34:59.890
It's done. Bring in the crane.

35:02.059 --> 35:03.352
You heard him, gents.

35:04.186 --> 35:06.396
Good job
defusing the bomb, old boy.

35:17.533 --> 35:20.869
So I've decided
to forgive Astrid for nemesising me.

35:20.869 --> 35:23.205
She took down the bad guy.
That's what we do, so. She's family now.

35:23.205 --> 35:26.416
Not a bad one to go out on,
being my last job.

35:26.416 --> 35:28.210
Last job? Be serious.

35:30.295 --> 35:31.588
What is it?

35:31.588 --> 35:33.632
There's still a loose end.

35:33.632 --> 35:36.969
The initial heist failed, but only because
it was tipped off to Interpol.

35:36.969 --> 35:40.138
It had to be someone who knew
that dropping the name Ramsey

35:40.138 --> 35:43.475
was going to bring
Inspector Astrid Pickford running.

35:43.475 --> 35:45.310
<i>Sophie, there's a lot more police here.</i>

35:46.436 --> 35:48.397
This doesn't feel right.

35:48.397 --> 35:50.065
Oh no.

35:50.065 --> 35:52.150
Hey, guys?

35:52.150 --> 35:55.320
Cops are swarming.
I'd say it's time to make like a tree.

35:59.533 --> 36:02.870
Breanna, find out where in the world
this call is coming from

36:02.870 --> 36:04.788
and if we have people there.

36:04.788 --> 36:05.706
Who is it?

36:07.875 --> 36:09.793
I know exactly what happened.

36:09.793 --> 36:11.920
The person who took down the London crew

36:11.920 --> 36:14.548
knew that we were gonna jump in
and finish the job.

36:14.548 --> 36:17.134
It had to be someone
who wanted to hurt Ramsey,

36:17.134 --> 36:18.969
knew my connection to Astrid,

36:18.969 --> 36:20.804
a carrot I couldn't resist,

36:20.804 --> 36:23.557
and that I might be
the only person talented enough

36:23.557 --> 36:27.060
and motivated enough
to bring Ramsey down for good.

36:27.686 --> 36:29.104
How did I do, Arthur?

36:30.981 --> 36:33.233
I'm so pleased you figured it out.

36:33.233 --> 36:35.611
This would have been
far less satisfying if you hadn't.

36:35.611 --> 36:38.113
<i>I assume all your people
can hear me by now.</i>

36:38.113 --> 36:40.782
<i>A tip of the hat on a job,
very well-done team.</i>

36:40.782 --> 36:44.202
I can only imagine how it must feel,
Sophie Devereaux,

36:44.202 --> 36:48.040
being used for your many talents
once again after all these years.

36:48.040 --> 36:50.876
<i>Though you have to agree,
Ramsey did deserve to be taken down.</i>

36:50.876 --> 36:52.586
Breanna, where?

36:53.337 --> 36:55.130
He's here.
He's right outside the museum.

36:55.130 --> 36:57.299
I can just picture Eliot right now.

36:58.842 --> 37:01.887
Thinking of all the ways
he can quietly take me out.

37:01.887 --> 37:04.514
Oh, no, no.
No, that's Parker.

37:04.514 --> 37:06.433
I'm thinking
about how I can do it very loudly.

37:06.433 --> 37:08.769
Sophie, he's right down
the street. I can take him.

37:08.769 --> 37:11.104
<i>No. Whatever this is,
he'd have thought of that.</i>

37:11.104 --> 37:12.689
All right, Arthur, out with it.

37:12.689 --> 37:13.982
<i>What's this about?</i>

37:13.982 --> 37:17.569
Well, they say,
when you go for revenge, dig two graves.

37:17.569 --> 37:20.864
<i>And I did, one for you and one for Ramsey.</i>

37:20.864 --> 37:23.700
While you and your team were busy
forging the Hanover Gallery,

37:23.700 --> 37:26.495
I was stealing a certain bejeweled crown,

37:26.495 --> 37:28.789
<i>just arrived today from India.</i>

37:28.789 --> 37:30.749
Sounds familiar.

37:30.749 --> 37:35.420
<i>Mm-hmm. Gems from the gold
Congo set by Cartier in the 1930s,</i>

37:35.420 --> 37:37.839
the Maharaja's crown.

37:37.839 --> 37:40.258
I can't believe you've never put
the pieces together.

37:40.258 --> 37:43.178
Of course, the last time we tried
to acquire it, I went to prison.

37:43.178 --> 37:44.429
<i>And you didn't.</i>

37:44.429 --> 37:46.348
<i>Things are gonna be
quite the opposite this time,</i>

37:46.348 --> 37:48.642
<i>as all the evidence points to you.</i>

37:48.642 --> 37:50.519
You've outdone yourself, Arthur.

37:50.519 --> 37:52.187
<i>Well, it was a stroke of luck really</i>

37:52.187 --> 37:54.773
<i>our paths crossing like that
in the States.</i>

37:54.773 --> 37:57.818
You trying so desperately
hard to pretend you've changed,

37:57.818 --> 37:59.653
that you forgot who you really are.

37:59.653 --> 38:01.154
And now, just months later,

38:01.154 --> 38:05.993
I used that to con you
into nailing yourself to the cross.

38:05.993 --> 38:09.663
<i>Revenge is sweet, Your Grace.</i>

38:09.663 --> 38:13.792
Anywho, I must go, best, always.

38:13.792 --> 38:16.420
<i>They're gonna love you in prison.</i>

38:18.046 --> 38:20.507
Time for phase two.

38:23.093 --> 38:25.971
So Arthur Wilde stole
the Maharaja's crown, when?

38:25.971 --> 38:27.848
When we were pulling off the Ramsey job.

38:27.848 --> 38:29.558
Fingerprints.

38:29.558 --> 38:33.270
I've been so stupid.
I should have seen...

38:33.270 --> 38:34.396
Well, you shouldn't have
seen this coming,

38:34.396 --> 38:36.440
he didn't want you to see this coming.

38:36.440 --> 38:39.067
This is classic misdirection.
We're looking one way.

38:39.067 --> 38:40.235
While he steals another.

38:40.235 --> 38:42.320
How did he override
the internal pressure sensors?

38:42.320 --> 38:43.780
- We didn't turn them off.
- <i>We didn't.</i>

38:43.780 --> 38:45.866
Our shenanigans
were confined to the third floor,

38:45.866 --> 38:48.744
but the museum's other security
measures are still on.

38:48.744 --> 38:50.871
I knew he was gonna try something.

38:50.871 --> 38:53.206
This...

38:53.206 --> 38:55.000
We should move now.

38:55.834 --> 38:56.877
Sophie, Let's go.

38:56.877 --> 38:58.211
Sophie!
