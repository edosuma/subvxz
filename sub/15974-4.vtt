[Up-tempo instrumental plays]

01:06:52.643 --> 01:06:55.010
<i>Casey: And Tanana,
who obviously can't see</i>

01:06:55.079 --> 01:06:57.275
<i>the end-zone marker
under the virgin snow,</i>

01:06:57.348 --> 01:07:00.318
<i>breaks into his touchdown dance
on the 10-yard line,</i>

01:07:00.384 --> 01:07:02.512
only to be given
a geography lesson

01:07:02.586 --> 01:07:04.850
by linebacker Marvin Watkins.

01:07:04.922 --> 01:07:06.981
That's an incredibly
embarrassing moment

01:07:07.058 --> 01:07:09.618
for any professional athlete,
so when we come back,

01:07:09.694 --> 01:07:11.594
we're gonna show it to you
a couple of more times

01:07:11.662 --> 01:07:14.688
if only so that I can keep
saying "virgin snow."

01:07:14.765 --> 01:07:17.928
<i>Dan: Stick around for more "Sports
Night," coming up after this.</i>

01:07:18.002 --> 01:07:19.561
We're out.

01:07:19.637 --> 01:07:20.627
Two minutes back.

01:07:20.705 --> 01:07:21.171
You know what?

01:07:21.238 --> 01:07:23.866
We're gonna be 15 seconds
short on the Bucks/Pacers.

01:07:23.975 --> 01:07:26.467
Jeremy, can you get Dan something
interesting about Milwaukee?

01:07:26.544 --> 01:07:29.070
I can tell you that it is not
the capital of Wisconsin.

01:07:29.146 --> 01:07:31.877
And while that may be true,
I need it to be about the team,

01:07:31.949 --> 01:07:34.008
and, oh, yeah,
I need it to be interesting.

01:07:34.085 --> 01:07:35.575
-- I was just saying for starters.
-- I got it.

01:07:35.653 --> 01:07:36.882
Has anybody else noticed

01:07:36.954 --> 01:07:38.581
that Casey's been flinching
a lot tonight?

01:07:38.656 --> 01:07:39.885
He's been doing it
for a couple of nights.

01:07:39.957 --> 01:07:42.051
-- Flinching? -- <i>Like</i> a <i>tic.</i>
-- <i>It's</i> a flinch.

01:07:42.126 --> 01:07:43.753
Casey, why are you flinching?

01:07:43.828 --> 01:07:44.852
I'm not flinching.

01:07:44.929 --> 01:07:46.260
Not now, but before.

01:07:46.330 --> 01:07:47.923
-- More like a tic.
-- It's a flinch.

01:07:47.999 --> 01:07:50.366
A flinch or a tic.
What's going on?

01:07:50.434 --> 01:07:52.528
-- There's a fly in the studio.
-- <i>A fly?</i>

01:07:52.603 --> 01:07:55.095
Yes, a big one. It's been
in here about three days now.

01:07:55.172 --> 01:07:56.765
Dave, there's a fly
in the studio?

01:07:56.841 --> 01:07:59.208
-- <i>I'm not seeing it.</i>
-- <i>Casey says there's</i> a <i>fly.</i>

01:07:59.276 --> 01:08:00.368
ls there a fly
in our studio?

01:08:00.444 --> 01:08:02.105
-- I'm not hearing anything.
-- There ain't no fly.

01:08:02.179 --> 01:08:04.045
Casey, there's no fly.

01:08:04.115 --> 01:08:07.278
Dana, there is a fly in the
studio the size of a bald eagle,

01:08:07.351 --> 01:08:09.479
and every time he buzzes my head
on a flyby,

01:08:09.553 --> 01:08:12.113
it's like a sound check
at a Black Sabbath concert.

01:08:12.189 --> 01:08:13.588
<i>You're not picking this up?</i>

01:08:13.657 --> 01:08:15.489
Dan, is there a fly
in the studio?

01:08:15.559 --> 01:08:17.049
Let him work through it.

01:08:17.127 --> 01:08:19.529
<i>Isaac, I see you're smiling
and holding a ratings book</i>

01:08:19.596 --> 01:08:21.462
both at the same time.
What do we know?

01:08:21.532 --> 01:08:23.523
We're not number one,
we're not number two,

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:27.196
but we picked up a point
and a half with men 18 to 49,

01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:30.069
and we took it evenly
from Fox and Bristol.

01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:33.236
Plus I'm always smiling this time of night.
You know why?

01:08:33.310 --> 01:08:35.608
-- Double Chivas on the rocks?
-- That's right.

01:08:35.679 --> 01:08:38.238
You hear that?
We're still number three.

01:08:38.314 --> 01:08:39.111
Here we go.

01:08:39.183 --> 01:08:41.948
The attendance
at tonight's game, 11,323,

01:08:42.019 --> 01:08:44.113
is exactly the same
as the population

01:08:44.188 --> 01:08:46.087
of Hoisington, Kansas.

01:08:50.528 --> 01:08:52.859
Okay, Dan,
here's the thing.

01:08:52.930 --> 01:08:55.991
<i>You're gonna be 15 seconds short
on the Bucks/Pacers</i> game.

01:08:56.067 --> 01:08:57.501
I have two options for you.

01:08:57.568 --> 01:09:02.165
Option one is that the
attendance at the game, 11,323,

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:06.471
turns out to be exactly the same
as the population of...

01:09:06.544 --> 01:09:08.308
Hoisington, Kansas.

01:09:08.379 --> 01:09:10.143
Hoisington, Kansas.

01:09:10.214 --> 01:09:11.943
And option two?

01:09:12.015 --> 01:09:13.346
Talk slower.

01:09:22.593 --> 01:09:25.858
Boy, it's almost hard
to believe we're in third place.

01:09:29.966 --> 01:09:33.267
Oh, yeah, I'm in pain.
I'd say this is pain.

01:09:33.337 --> 01:09:34.805
Elliott, can you get me

01:09:34.872 --> 01:09:36.237
a recruiting file
on Conference USA?

01:09:36.307 --> 01:09:37.536
Very sure I'd call this pain.

01:09:37.608 --> 01:09:39.167
-- Just football or...
-- Football/basketball.

01:09:39.243 --> 01:09:40.301
I'd say this is a pain

01:09:40.377 --> 01:09:41.810
that was gonna last
well into the new year.

01:09:41.879 --> 01:09:44.246
-- What happened?
-- Not important.

01:09:44.314 --> 01:09:46.215
They told me that if
I took care of my body,

01:09:46.283 --> 01:09:47.478
my body would take care of me.

01:09:47.551 --> 01:09:48.712
I need the last three years.

01:09:48.786 --> 01:09:49.981
I took care of my body,

01:09:50.054 --> 01:09:51.488
and my body just deserted me
at that moment.

01:09:51.555 --> 01:09:53.580
<i>No, your brain
deserted you, Casey.</i>

01:09:53.657 --> 01:09:54.715
Your body was fine.

01:09:54.792 --> 01:09:56.419
I have a broken ankle.
You're not concerned

01:09:56.494 --> 01:09:58.189
-- I have a broken ankle?
-- Where does it hurt?

01:09:59.597 --> 01:10:02.089
In my ankle, Danny.
It hurts in my ankle.

01:10:02.166 --> 01:10:04.658
-- <i>You shouldn't move it.</i>
-- <i>I can't move it.</i>

01:10:04.735 --> 01:10:06.328
-- Well, then, you're all set.
-- [Telephone rings]

01:10:06.403 --> 01:10:08.098
Hey, if that's Dana,
I'm not here.

01:10:08.172 --> 01:10:10.163
-- Why would it be Dana?
-- I'm <i>saying it</i> could <i>be Dana.</i>

01:10:10.241 --> 01:10:12.266
It could be a lot of people.
Hello?

01:10:12.343 --> 01:10:14.072
-- It's Dana.
-- Hey, I'm not here.

01:10:14.145 --> 01:10:15.408
Yeah, he's right here.
What do you need?

01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:18.610
<i>No, he's not flinching
or anything. He seems fine.</i>

01:10:18.682 --> 01:10:21.379
-- <i>I'm not fine.</i> I <i>have</i> a <i>broken ankle.</i>
-- <i>l/Ve got that off the wire.</i>

01:10:21.452 --> 01:10:23.614
<i>Hey, tell her
I have a broken ankle.</i>

01:10:23.687 --> 01:10:25.416
Casey says he has
a broken ankle.

01:10:25.489 --> 01:10:26.923
Yeah.
Now tell her it hurts.

01:10:26.991 --> 01:10:28.618
He says it hurts.

01:10:28.692 --> 01:10:31.024
Yeah. Now make this part
sound dignified and heroic --

01:10:31.095 --> 01:10:33.189
'Cause he kicked a fire hydrant
on his way back from lunch.

01:10:33.264 --> 01:10:34.254
Would you stop talking
about it now?

01:10:34.331 --> 01:10:36.595
'Cause he just found out you were going
to Vermont this weekend with Gordon.

01:10:36.667 --> 01:10:38.658
That is not why!
That is not why!

01:10:39.837 --> 01:10:41.464
Yeah, he's walking around
pretty good now.

01:10:41.539 --> 01:10:43.701
See you
at the afternoon rundown.

01:10:44.642 --> 01:10:46.701
-- VVell, thanks for the teamwork.
-- No problem.

01:10:46.777 --> 01:10:47.972
Well, did she say anything?

01:10:48.045 --> 01:10:50.070
She said you shouldn't kick
fire hydrants.

01:10:50.147 --> 01:10:52.479
-- I didn't see the fire hydrant.
-- What were you <i>trying to kick?</i>

01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:54.780
-- I was trying to kick you.
-- Why?

01:10:54.852 --> 01:10:57.184
You've known for a while now that
she's been seeing this guy Gordon.

01:10:57.254 --> 01:10:58.244
Yes.

01:10:58.322 --> 01:10:59.619
-- You didn't tell me.
-- Right.

01:10:59.690 --> 01:11:00.885
Why?

01:11:00.958 --> 01:11:04.656
I thought you might be upset.
I can see now I was wrong.

01:11:05.763 --> 01:11:07.458
Look, I'm not upset,
all right?

01:11:07.531 --> 01:11:09.829
I've known Dana for 15 years.

01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:11.664
She just does this kind
of thing from time to time.

01:11:11.735 --> 01:11:13.396
-- You mean have a personal life?
-- Yeah.

01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:15.905
-- She does it to make me jealous. -- I
don't think it's gonna work. Do you?

01:11:15.973 --> 01:11:18.567
My behavior is not motivated
by jealousy, Danny.

01:11:18.642 --> 01:11:19.768
This is not jealousy.

01:11:19.843 --> 01:11:21.902
What is your behavior
motivated by?

01:11:21.979 --> 01:11:24.141
It's an emotion I'm having a difficult
time putting my finger on at the moment,

01:11:24.215 --> 01:11:25.774
but, uh, it'll come to me.

01:11:25.849 --> 01:11:29.479
Dan, I just got a call from a woman
named Malory Moss in business affairs.

01:11:29.553 --> 01:11:31.453
She needs to talk to you
about some accounting.

01:11:31.522 --> 01:11:33.047
All right, tell her
it'll have to wait, okay?

01:11:33.123 --> 01:11:34.557
Casey and I are doing
some work right now.

01:11:34.625 --> 01:11:36.320
Ankle pain, ankle pain,
ankle pain.

01:11:36.393 --> 01:11:38.054
-- I'll be right there!
-- Oh, God!

01:11:40.097 --> 01:11:43.465
You know something? I can't think
of the last time I had a good idea.

01:11:43.534 --> 01:11:44.797
This segment's a good idea.

01:11:44.868 --> 01:11:46.165
It's not a really good idea.

01:11:46.237 --> 01:11:49.002
It's a fine idea.
It's a regular idea.

01:11:49.073 --> 01:11:50.404
You have good ideas a lot.

01:11:50.474 --> 01:11:52.806
I find myself saying,
"Natalie's got a good idea."

01:11:52.876 --> 01:11:54.139
But you also
find yourself saying,

01:11:54.211 --> 01:11:56.680
"Natalie, if you screw that up
again, I'll set you on fire."

01:11:56.747 --> 01:12:00.240
That's true, too, and yet it's the
good-idea thing I'm focusing on right now.

01:12:00.317 --> 01:12:01.512
Do you like this shot here?

01:12:01.585 --> 01:12:04.111
All I'm looking at
is the Pepsi sign.

01:12:04.188 --> 01:12:06.350
Moving on.

01:12:06.423 --> 01:12:08.084
What was the last
good idea you had?

01:12:08.158 --> 01:12:11.492
When I got up this morning, I decided
not to stick my hand in the blender.

01:12:11.562 --> 01:12:13.724
-- That's what I mean.
-- [Laughs]

01:12:13.797 --> 01:12:15.026
How 'bout this?

01:12:15.099 --> 01:12:16.498
That's good.

01:12:16.567 --> 01:12:19.901
I think the way you're handling
the Casey situation is very good.

01:12:19.970 --> 01:12:22.234
The Casey situation?

01:12:22.306 --> 01:12:23.740
I'm calling it
"the Casey situation."

01:12:23.807 --> 01:12:25.639
-- <i>It's not</i> a <i>situation.</i>
-- <i>It's</i> a <i>bit of a situation.</i>

01:12:25.709 --> 01:12:27.837
-- It's not at all a situation.
-- I've <i>already named</i> it.

01:12:27.911 --> 01:12:30.881
You know, from, like, the
second Casey and Lisa split up,

01:12:30.948 --> 01:12:34.145
everyone in this office is
convinced that I have a strategy

01:12:34.218 --> 01:12:37.313
-- for getting Casey to fall in
love with me. -- You're wrong.

01:12:37.388 --> 01:12:38.981
We knew you didn't have
a strategy,

01:12:39.056 --> 01:12:40.785
and we're glad you've finally
come up with something.

01:12:40.858 --> 01:12:43.020
I have not come up
with something.

01:12:43.093 --> 01:12:44.390
Well, at least
you're asking for help.

01:12:44.461 --> 01:12:47.453
Natalie, I am not employing
a strategy.

01:12:47.531 --> 01:12:50.193
You're going to Vermont
for the weekend with Gordon.

01:12:50.267 --> 01:12:51.200
Yes, I am.

01:12:51.268 --> 01:12:53.396
-- And you bought new lingerie.
-- Yes, I did.

01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:55.029
And you went out of your way

01:12:55.105 --> 01:12:57.597
to make sure Casey knew
you bought new lingerie.

01:12:57.675 --> 01:12:59.700
-- I <i>did</i> not!
-- <i>Right. That was me.</i>

01:12:59.777 --> 01:13:03.008
-- <i>Natalie!</i> -- <i>l/VeH, let's get
this show on the road already, huh?</i>

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:05.674
There is no show,
and there's no road.

01:13:05.749 --> 01:13:08.377
You're going to Vermont
with Gordon and new lingerie.

01:13:08.452 --> 01:13:11.285
Yes, I am, because I choose to,

01:13:11.355 --> 01:13:13.289
and there's nothing sinister
about it.

01:13:13.357 --> 01:13:16.019
I like Gordon,
and I like Vermont,

01:13:16.093 --> 01:13:18.926
so I am going with Gordon
to Vermont,

01:13:18.996 --> 01:13:21.397
<i>and I'm taking
new lingerie for me.</i>

01:13:21.465 --> 01:13:23.126
This is for me.

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:26.397
Well, I gotta say, you got Casey
right where you want him.

01:13:32.943 --> 01:13:34.001
[Knocking on wall]

01:13:34.078 --> 01:13:35.739
-- Hi. Excuse me.
-- Oh, hi.

01:13:35.813 --> 01:13:37.406
I'm Dan Rydell.
They said you wanted to see me.

01:13:37.481 --> 01:13:39.040
Yes, yes, I do.
Hi, I'm Malory Moss.

01:13:39.116 --> 01:13:41.175
I just started this week,
so please pardon the mess.

01:13:41.251 --> 01:13:43.447
-- That's fine.
-- [Grunts]

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:45.784
Look, there's a revolving door
here on business affairs,

01:13:45.856 --> 01:13:47.654
and I go through this
with all the new people.

01:13:47.725 --> 01:13:50.990
My out-of-town expense sheets
tend to be a little unusual.

01:13:51.061 --> 01:13:52.927
Yes, I noticed,
but that's not the problem.

01:13:52.996 --> 01:13:55.397
-- <i>What's the problem?</i> -- <i>During
your broadcast on September 5,</i>

01:13:55.466 --> 01:13:57.867
you sang "Happy Birthday"
to your partner, Casey McCall.

01:13:57.935 --> 01:13:59.630
Yeah, but I can explain that.
<i>I __</i>

01:13:59.703 --> 01:14:01.296
Wait. It was his birthday.
Why do I have to explain that?

01:14:01.372 --> 01:14:03.067
You sang "Happy Birthday"
on the air.

01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:04.630
-- Dana cleared it.
-- Who's Dana?

01:14:04.708 --> 01:14:06.301
Dana Whitaker's
the producer of the show.

01:14:06.377 --> 01:14:09.312
Ooh, yes. VVell, my
predecessor didn't clear it.

01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:11.246
-- Who's your predecessor?
-- <i>Marty</i> Sheinbaum.

01:14:11.315 --> 01:14:13.807
-- <i>Who's</i> Marty <i>Sheinbaum?</i>
-- <i>My predecessor.</i>

01:14:14.852 --> 01:14:16.547
Look, I don't have
a whole lot of time --

01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:18.384
Listen, I think it's sweet

01:14:18.455 --> 01:14:20.787
that you and your partner sing
to each other on television.

01:14:20.858 --> 01:14:23.418
Others may think it's vaguely
gay, but I disagree.

01:14:26.930 --> 01:14:28.022
Thank you.

01:14:28.098 --> 01:14:30.499
-- Nonetheless, you can't do it anymore.
-- Why not?

01:14:30.567 --> 01:14:33.036
-- <i>It's against the law.</i> -- <i>It's
against the law to be vaguely gay?</i>

01:14:33.103 --> 01:14:35.299
It's against the law to sing
“Happy Birthday“ on television.

01:14:35.372 --> 01:14:38.034
-- That doesn't sound quite right to me.
-- <i>It</i> is.

01:14:38.108 --> 01:14:40.770
-- You went to law school and
everything, right? -- Yeah.

01:14:40.844 --> 01:14:42.369
-- You took the bar?
-- Three times.

01:14:42.446 --> 01:14:45.609
-- It's against the law to sing “Happy Birthday“
on television? -- Federal copyright law.

01:14:45.682 --> 01:14:47.446
-- “Happy Birthday“ is
protected material? -- Yes.

01:14:47.518 --> 01:14:49.111
Who holds the copyright
to "Happy Birthday"?

01:14:49.186 --> 01:14:51.280
The representatives
of Mildred and Patty Hill.

01:14:51.355 --> 01:14:52.652
-- Mildred and Patty Hill?
-- The authors.

01:14:52.723 --> 01:14:54.191
-- The authors? They wrote the song?
-- They wrote it.

01:14:54.258 --> 01:14:55.726
Did you think that song
just happened?

01:14:55.793 --> 01:14:57.488
Well, yeah.

01:14:57.561 --> 01:14:59.222
Oh. It didn't.

01:14:59.296 --> 01:15:00.695
Live and learn.

01:15:00.764 --> 01:15:02.391
Yes, indeed.

01:15:02.466 --> 01:15:03.956
Would they be happy
with an autographed hat?

01:15:04.034 --> 01:15:05.399
Yes, they would.

01:15:05.469 --> 01:15:06.994
Great.

01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:09.300
-- Along with $2,500.
-- I'm sorry?

01:15:09.373 --> 01:15:11.501
They've billed the network
$2,500.

01:15:12.209 --> 01:15:15.543
$2,500
to sing "Happy Birthday"?

01:15:15.612 --> 01:15:17.546
-- Yes.
-- Ouch.

these things may not mean
anything to you,

01:15:23.287 --> 01:15:25.051
but I assure you
they mean a great deal to me,

01:15:25.122 --> 01:15:26.886
and they meant a great deal
to my predecessor.

01:15:26.957 --> 01:15:29.221
-- Marty Sheinbaum.
-- Marty Sheinbaum.

01:15:34.431 --> 01:15:35.364
You know what?

01:15:35.432 --> 01:15:38.993
<i>From now on, I am only singing
songs in the public domain.</i>

01:15:39.069 --> 01:15:41.401
-- <i>That'll</i> teach <i>'em.</i>
-- <i>I'm not kidding.</i>

01:15:41.472 --> 01:15:42.530
Go knock 'em dead.

01:15:45.509 --> 01:15:46.999
[Telephone rings]

01:15:47.077 --> 01:15:48.442
Jeremy...

01:15:48.512 --> 01:15:50.742
-- <i>Right here.</i>
-- <i>Would you follow me, please?</i>

01:15:50.814 --> 01:15:52.339
What's up?

01:15:52.416 --> 01:15:55.351
I hold here in my hand
a tape of last night's show.

01:15:55.419 --> 01:15:56.682
I will put it in the VCR,

01:15:56.753 --> 01:15:58.983
We shall fast-forward
to the portions where I flinch,

01:15:59.056 --> 01:16:00.956
and you will see in the tape
that there is a fly.

01:16:01.024 --> 01:16:02.514
I don't think
this is really necessary.

01:16:02.593 --> 01:16:04.254
You will bear witness.
You will bear witness,

01:16:04.328 --> 01:16:06.057
and you will tell everyone
that I'm not crazy.

01:16:06.129 --> 01:16:08.063
-- I don't think anyone thinks
you're crazy. -- I think they do.

01:16:08.131 --> 01:16:10.998
-- I'm sure you're wrong. -- VVell, it
feels like everyone thinks I'm crazy.

01:16:11.068 --> 01:16:12.934
I have a lot of experience
with that feeling.

01:16:13.003 --> 01:16:14.528
-- Yeah, I'm sure you do.
-- Yes.

01:16:14.605 --> 01:16:17.302
Okay, right here -- right when
we come back to this scene --

01:16:17.374 --> 01:16:20.469
you're gonna see clear as can be
that there is a fly right here.

01:16:22.212 --> 01:16:23.907
Where the hell's the fly?

01:16:23.981 --> 01:16:27.144
<i>Well, why don't I just tell
everybody that I saw the fly?</i>

01:16:27.217 --> 01:16:28.685
-- Look, this isn't in my head.
-- Of course it's not.

01:16:28.752 --> 01:16:30.584
-- No, seriously.
-- I know.

01:16:30.654 --> 01:16:31.780
There's a fly in there.

01:16:31.855 --> 01:16:34.483
Maybe he only makes himself
visible to you.

01:16:34.558 --> 01:16:37.084
Maybe he only makes himself
visible to me?

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:38.787
Like the rabbit in "Harvey."

01:16:38.862 --> 01:16:40.489
-- No, no, this isn't like the rabbit
in “Harvey.“ -- Of course it's not.

01:16:40.564 --> 01:16:41.963
-- No, seriously.
-- No, I know.

01:16:42.032 --> 01:16:44.091
-- Jeremy -- -- I'm just saying
whether it's there or not...

01:16:44.167 --> 01:16:45.726
you're making me believe
it's there.

01:16:45.802 --> 01:16:46.928
-- <i>It's there.</i>
-- <i>I believe it.</i>

01:16:47.004 --> 01:16:47.994
Good.

01:16:49.139 --> 01:16:50.732
-- Can I say something?
-- Yeah.

01:16:50.807 --> 01:16:52.935
-- Can I speak candidly for a moment?
-- That's fine.

01:16:53.010 --> 01:16:54.978
'Cause I'm the new guy here, and I
don't want to overstep my bounds.

01:16:55.045 --> 01:16:56.479
-- You're not. -- I'm not
overstepping my bounds?

01:16:56.547 --> 01:16:58.345
Your bounds are fine.
Don't worry about your bounds.

01:16:58.415 --> 01:17:00.611
It just seems to me,
what with kicking fire hydrants

01:17:00.684 --> 01:17:02.448
and your on-air hallucinations,

01:17:02.519 --> 01:17:04.419
that you've gotten your head
turned around pretty good.

01:17:04.488 --> 01:17:06.013
I'm not having hallucinations.

01:17:06.089 --> 01:17:08.751
The fire hydrant got in my way, and
there's nothing wrong with my head.

01:17:08.825 --> 01:17:10.919
-- Good.
-- I'm not obsessing about Dana.

01:17:10.994 --> 01:17:12.462
-- Dana?
-- Yeah.

01:17:12.529 --> 01:17:15.430
Dana's my friend, Jeremy. She's
been my friend for 15 years.

01:17:15.499 --> 01:17:16.660
-- Oh, that?
-- Yeah.

01:17:16.733 --> 01:17:18.201
Oh, as far as Vermont
is concerned,

01:17:18.268 --> 01:17:19.758
it is my understanding
that the weekend

01:17:19.836 --> 01:17:21.326
is almost entirely about sex.

01:17:23.407 --> 01:17:25.466
Well, that makes me feel,
God, so much better.

01:17:25.542 --> 01:17:26.509
Sure.

01:17:26.577 --> 01:17:27.806
L-I'm not interested
in Dana.

01:17:27.878 --> 01:17:29.539
L-| don't care
about her weekend plans.

01:17:29.613 --> 01:17:30.739
-- Right.
-- No, seriously.

01:17:30.814 --> 01:17:32.475
Call me if you find the fly.

01:17:38.555 --> 01:17:40.489
<i>You know, Landingham's
getting dumped.</i>

01:17:40.557 --> 01:17:42.548
It's either gonna be
Biselli or --

01:17:42.626 --> 01:17:43.787
Oh, the guy from Iowa state.

01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:46.022
-- Kitner. -- Yeah. --
It's not gonna be Kitner.

01:17:46.096 --> 01:17:48.292
It's gonna be Biselli, but either way,
it's time to get this on the air.

01:17:48.365 --> 01:17:50.129
-- <i>You have sources?</i>
-- <i>We have</i> a <i>healthy hunch.</i>

01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:52.328
-- <i>You have sources?</i>
-- <i>Not for attribution.</i>

01:17:52.402 --> 01:17:53.870
<i>Get someone
to go on the record.</i>

01:17:53.937 --> 01:17:55.063
That's when we'll get it
on the air.

01:17:55.138 --> 01:17:57.163
No one understands the value
of a healthy hunch.

01:17:57.240 --> 01:17:59.868
Our lawyers understand
the value of a healthy hunch.

01:17:59.943 --> 01:18:02.969
It's $400 an hour
plus court costs.

01:18:03.046 --> 01:18:04.480
<i>Get someone
to go on the record.</i>

01:18:04.548 --> 01:18:06.880
Now, what do we know
about the phantom fly?

01:18:09.987 --> 01:18:11.352
It's not a phantom.

01:18:11.421 --> 01:18:12.650
Fine.

01:18:12.723 --> 01:18:14.851
-- It's not a phantom fly. It's a real fly.
-- We believe you.

01:18:14.925 --> 01:18:17.758
I'm like Tippi Hedren
in there.

01:18:18.929 --> 01:18:20.328
Nonetheless, the flinching --

01:18:20.397 --> 01:18:21.831
-- Like a tic.
-- It's a flinch.

01:18:21.898 --> 01:18:22.490
Listen to me.

01:18:24.134 --> 01:18:26.626
There is a fly in the studio, and
this is not a normal-sized fly.

01:18:26.703 --> 01:18:28.000
It's a jumbo fly.

01:18:28.071 --> 01:18:32.338
<i>It has made a habit now of flying
into my monitors at a great velocity.</i>

01:18:32.409 --> 01:18:35.435
You would think that at this velocity
it would blow apart on impact,

01:18:35.512 --> 01:18:38.948
but apparently this fly has
some sort of protective coating

01:18:39.016 --> 01:18:41.348
that allows it
to come right back at me.

01:18:41.418 --> 01:18:43.614
-- Protective coating?
-- <i>Yes.</i>

01:18:43.687 --> 01:18:46.122
Does the fly have
any other special powers?

01:18:46.189 --> 01:18:47.816
No.

01:18:47.891 --> 01:18:52.021
VVell, Jeremy thinks it might have
some sort of stealth capability.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:57.933
Dana?

01:18:58.001 --> 01:18:59.628
We'll brush the studio.

01:18:59.703 --> 01:19:01.933
That's all.
Final rundown's at 10:00.

01:19:03.940 --> 01:19:06.602
-- Hey, Isaac, you got a second?
-- What's going on?

01:19:06.677 --> 01:19:09.738
I got the intellectual-property
cops crawling up my butt.

01:19:09.813 --> 01:19:12.510
-- The intellectual-property cops“.
-- Yeah.

01:19:12.582 --> 01:19:14.710
...are crawling up your butt?

01:19:14.785 --> 01:19:15.877
The heat's all over me.

01:19:15.952 --> 01:19:17.943
What the hell
are you talking about, Dan?

01:19:18.021 --> 01:19:20.319
I sang "Happy Birthday"
to Casey on the air.

01:19:20.390 --> 01:19:21.323
When?

01:19:21.391 --> 01:19:23.917
Well...on his birthday,
Isaac.

01:19:23.994 --> 01:19:25.428
Oh, sure.

01:19:25.495 --> 01:19:28.795
The network's being charged
$2,500 by the copyright holder.

01:19:28.865 --> 01:19:31.266
Someone holds the copyright
to "Happy Birthday"?

01:19:31.334 --> 01:19:33.769
The representatives
of Patty and Mildred Hill.

01:19:33.837 --> 01:19:36.135
-- Took two people to write that song?
-- Go figure.

01:19:36.206 --> 01:19:37.970
The important thing is
I'm putting together

01:19:38.041 --> 01:19:39.566
a list of songs
in the public domain,

01:19:39.643 --> 01:19:40.940
and I'm asking each person
to pick a song

01:19:41.011 --> 01:19:42.604
they'd like to have sung
to them on their birthday.

01:19:42.679 --> 01:19:44.738
Why are you talking to me?

01:19:44.815 --> 01:19:46.806
For you, I've boiled it down
to two choices --

01:19:46.883 --> 01:19:50.046
"Jammo, Jammo"
by Giuseppe Verdi

01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:52.555
or "Yo-Ho-Ho,
And a Bottle of Rum!"

01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:57.117
Are you on any medication
right now?

01:19:57.194 --> 01:19:58.958
I'm gonna go
with the Verdi.

01:19:59.029 --> 01:20:00.121
[Snaps fingers]

01:20:06.670 --> 01:20:09.264
<i>If you freeze-frame
this shot here</i> -- <i>right</i> --

01:20:09.339 --> 01:20:10.966
and lose the Pepsi sign,

01:20:11.041 --> 01:20:12.873
you spot-shadow
the right inside linebacker,

01:20:12.943 --> 01:20:15.378
then cut back to movement
on the whole field. That works.

01:20:15.445 --> 01:20:17.470
Jeremy,
Dana's got me thinking.

01:20:17.547 --> 01:20:18.981
When was the last time
you had a good idea?

01:20:19.049 --> 01:20:21.177
-- <i>It was right then.</i>
-- <i>That's not what I mean.</i>

01:20:21.251 --> 01:20:23.549
-- <i>It was</i> a <i>good idea.</i> -- <i>I was
talking on</i> a <i>grander scale.</i>

01:20:23.620 --> 01:20:26.453
-- I <i>see.</i> -- <i>I</i> mean, a <i>good idea on
the grand scale of human experience.</i>

01:20:26.523 --> 01:20:28.287
-- Yes. -- When was the
last time you had one?

01:20:28.358 --> 01:20:31.623
-- A good idea on the grand scale
of human experience? -- Yes.

01:20:31.695 --> 01:20:34.164
You understand I'm saying we
spot-shadow the inside linebacker?

01:20:34.231 --> 01:20:35.824
-- <i>Yes.</i>
-- That doesn't count?

01:20:35.899 --> 01:20:38.095
I feel like a freeloader
sometimes,

01:20:38.168 --> 01:20:40.694
leaving the good ideas
up to other people.

01:20:40.771 --> 01:20:42.830
I feel like I'm
standing on the shoulders

01:20:42.906 --> 01:20:44.533
of generations past.

01:20:44.608 --> 01:20:46.098
-- Do you know what I mean?
-- Yes.

01:20:46.176 --> 01:20:48.201
-- Really? -- My grandfather
invented the clipboard.

01:20:48.278 --> 01:20:49.939
-- Did he?
-- Well, he didn't invent it,

01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:53.177
but he always used to complain that he
didn't have a portable writing surface.

01:20:54.084 --> 01:20:56.382
-- I don't think you're getting it.
-- Yeah, I don't think so.

01:20:56.453 --> 01:20:59.548
