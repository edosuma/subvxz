WEBVTT

00:00.100 --> 00:03.400
Look at me, right?
And look at the Queen.

00:03.900 --> 00:06.700
I was never a fan
until it occurred to me how much

00:06.800 --> 00:08.600
me and Ma'am have in common.

00:08.600 --> 00:11.200
Bringing up kiddies you can't
remember the names of.

00:11.200 --> 00:14.600
I know she's not a single parent
but she might as well be.

00:14.600 --> 00:17.800
Plus, the pair of us,
we've stuck to our guns -

00:17.900 --> 00:21.400
her, literally, sometimes -
and flagshipped a dying breed.

00:21.400 --> 00:23.800
Admired and despised equally.

00:23.800 --> 00:25.300
Not for never lifting a finger -

00:25.300 --> 00:29.300
no, for setting examples
through extremity.

00:29.300 --> 00:31.900
And whether you're a bigwig on her
end or a bigwig on mine,

00:31.900 --> 00:34.500
you've still got all your dickheads
in the middle to deal with -

00:34.500 --> 00:36.600
snip, snip, snipping at your
benefits.

00:36.700 --> 00:38.900
I mean, she can't not be looking
at me and thinking,

00:38.900 --> 00:41.100
"What's your secret, Frank?"

00:41.100 --> 00:43.800
I got shot of my kids yonks back,

00:43.800 --> 00:46.000
whereas, she's yet to see
the back of a single one.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.500
Fine, I've had to get out of bed
on occasion, to make ends meet,

00:49.500 --> 00:53.500
whereas she, she's done
the whole thing from a chair!

00:54.800 --> 00:56.500
Oh, and a drink for the lady.

00:56.500 --> 00:59.100
Oh, sure, there's perks
but, look at her lot -

00:59.100 --> 01:01.400
Brian May prancing
about on her roof.

01:01.400 --> 01:03.700
Now, look at my lot...

01:03.700 --> 01:07.800
we know how to throw
a proper fucking party!

01:07.800 --> 01:12.800

01:13.000 --> 01:15.100
Why are people afraid of routine?

01:15.100 --> 01:18.000
I know how each day begins,
I know how it ends,

01:18.000 --> 01:20.300
and I know what to expect
in between.

01:20.300 --> 01:22.200
That doesn't mean that
life's passing me by

01:22.200 --> 01:26.000
or that I'm stuck in me ways -
I can have fun...

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
..but I believe in responsibility
and reliability. It's a strength.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.500
Leave it to fools to rush in.

01:35.500 --> 01:38.500
To gamble with their futures
and other people's,

01:38.500 --> 01:41.800
to risk losing it all
because they twist, not stick.

01:41.800 --> 01:44.400
As if getting a new job,
moving to a new town,

01:44.400 --> 01:46.600
or riding a stinking camel
across the desert

01:46.600 --> 01:50.600
is going to make their lives
any better.

01:51.500 --> 01:55.500
Just want to run a check
on a Dr Martin Fisher.

01:58.700 --> 02:02.700
Sticking with what you know
can only make you stronger.

02:08.400 --> 02:10.300
No, ta...

02:10.400 --> 02:13.800
I'll stick to council pop.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.400
Urgh!

02:16.400 --> 02:18.000
My head's been pickled, man.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.400
Small wonder,
you really went for it.

02:25.600 --> 02:26.800
What?

02:26.800 --> 02:28.600
- You don't remember.
- Remember what?

02:28.600 --> 02:32.600
Oh, no, don't worry,
I won't say anything.

02:37.300 --> 02:40.300
Oh, I just got to take this. Hello?

02:40.300 --> 02:42.100
You're winding me up.

02:50.600 --> 02:52.600
Kassi Blanco?

02:52.600 --> 02:53.400
No, mate.

02:53.400 --> 02:55.200
Yeah, I'm Kassi Blanco.

02:55.200 --> 02:59.200
DCI Morgan. I have a warrant
to search these premises.

03:00.600 --> 03:01.800
What's this all about?

03:01.800 --> 03:03.800
Well, it starts with fake
mortgage applications,

03:03.800 --> 03:07.400
goes on to spurious bank accounts,
money laundering, fraud -

03:07.500 --> 03:08.300
want me to go on?

03:08.300 --> 03:10.500
No, I have no idea what
you're talking about.

03:10.500 --> 03:12.400
I'll have to caution you.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.600
What's going on?

03:13.600 --> 03:17.600
It's fine, I have nothing to hide.

03:27.700 --> 03:31.700
Will you get that?

03:36.900 --> 03:40.200
Dad's asleep.

03:40.200 --> 03:43.500
We're looking for Dr Martin Fisher
and Kelly Ball.

03:43.500 --> 03:44.800
Wrong house, love.

03:44.800 --> 03:46.000
Mind if we have a look around?

03:46.100 --> 03:50.100
Got a warrant?

03:51.400 --> 03:52.900
What did dibble want?

03:52.900 --> 03:56.900
Looking for Marty and Kelly.

04:06.800 --> 04:09.000
Ah, I haven't worn that
jacket in ages.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.400
Celebrating Ramadan, were you?

04:11.400 --> 04:13.700
Er, godfather at a Christening.

04:13.700 --> 04:17.700
Need you to come down the station,
answer a few questions.

04:21.100 --> 04:22.900
Your accounts, your assets -

04:23.000 --> 04:26.700
all been frozen pending
our investigation.

04:26.700 --> 04:29.100
I'll be back soon.

04:29.100 --> 04:33.100
I can just see it now - few kids
running about, you washing the car,

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
me sunbathing, IKEA on a Saturday,
garden centre on a Sunday...

04:41.600 --> 04:45.600
Give 'em a ring, we should have
heard from 'em by now.

04:46.400 --> 04:50.200
Hello, yes, this is Dr Fisher...

04:50.200 --> 04:52.500
Sorry?

04:52.500 --> 04:54.200
All right, Willy Wanka?

04:54.200 --> 04:58.200
Just looking for some tissues,
to mop up.

05:01.800 --> 05:03.100
Marty, what is it?

05:03.100 --> 05:07.100
Oh, yeah, police were round our
place earlier, looking for you two.

05:08.400 --> 05:12.400
Our mortgage has been rejected.

05:14.600 --> 05:17.600
What we going to do?
We've lost the bleeding lot!

05:17.600 --> 05:18.500
We could stay here?

05:18.500 --> 05:19.800
Oh, piss off.

05:19.900 --> 05:23.900
Go back to Frank's?

05:25.200 --> 05:29.200
Hello, Kelly, love, you all right?

05:29.200 --> 05:30.100
Never better.

05:30.100 --> 05:33.600
You look as if you've seen a ghost.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.400
Here you are...

05:36.400 --> 05:38.300
..all you need is love...

05:38.300 --> 05:42.300
but a likkle chocolate now
and then doesn't hurt either.

05:49.100 --> 05:52.500
Could always...see if Lillian
would take you back?

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
More, more!

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
More, more, yeah!

06:00.400 --> 06:02.400
I hope they've gone
to a better place.

06:02.400 --> 06:04.300
Chinese Dave's made sure of it.

06:04.300 --> 06:05.400
What?

06:05.400 --> 06:08.100
I said stop squawking and get
on with the cleaning.

06:08.100 --> 06:11.300
It's a hot tub, not a duck pond!

06:11.300 --> 06:13.400
Duck shit's a right bugger to shift.

06:13.400 --> 06:17.400
Vodka and baking soda -
works every time.

06:21.900 --> 06:22.700
What's going on?

06:22.700 --> 06:24.200
Nothing. No charges.

06:24.200 --> 06:26.600
Money laundering, fraud -
didn't sound like nothing.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.800
Nothing, for now.

06:28.800 --> 06:31.100
I can help get a brief, you know,
get this sorted.

06:31.100 --> 06:33.400
Jamie, believe me,
I know what I'm doing.

06:33.400 --> 06:36.000
It's not a pub brawl.

06:36.100 --> 06:40.100
I really shouldn't have tried to
pass Marty and Kelly off as doctors.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.400
What, this is their fault?

06:41.400 --> 06:45.400
No, no, tip of the iceberg.

06:47.300 --> 06:51.300
Daft buggers didn't look everywhere!

06:52.600 --> 06:54.500
Pension, eh?

06:54.600 --> 06:56.700
You're going to chip,
just like that?

06:56.700 --> 07:00.700
Well, one door closes,
another one opens.

07:02.200 --> 07:06.200
Right, I'm going to start packing!

07:07.500 --> 07:10.800
What the fuck's going on?

07:10.800 --> 07:14.800
I just need somewhere
to lay low for a few days.

07:23.900 --> 07:25.400
What's happening here?

07:25.400 --> 07:27.100
I'll tell you what's happening here.

07:27.100 --> 07:30.600
I've got five minutes, Shane,
I don't want any pissing about,

07:30.600 --> 07:33.100
I just want you
to fuck me from behind

07:33.200 --> 07:35.500
and stick your thumb up my arse.

07:35.500 --> 07:36.700
Are you taking the piss?

07:36.700 --> 07:40.700
Do I look like I'm taking the piss?

07:41.600 --> 07:43.200
Shane?

07:43.200 --> 07:45.500
You in, mate?

07:45.500 --> 07:49.100
I won't warn you again, Maguire,
this is the third time in a month

07:49.100 --> 07:51.900
we've had complaints about
underage drinking!

07:52.000 --> 07:54.400
How many times do I have
to come over?

07:54.400 --> 07:55.900
I'll sort it.

07:55.900 --> 07:59.900
You'd better.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.600
Sick of the sight of that lot today.

08:02.600 --> 08:03.800
What you doing here anyway?

08:03.800 --> 08:05.400
I need a favour,
you still got the van?

08:05.400 --> 08:06.600
Yes, why?

08:06.600 --> 08:10.600
My brother's screwed up -
for once, it's not you.

08:16.200 --> 08:17.900
What the fuck do you want?

08:17.900 --> 08:19.600
I want you two to do one, now.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.500
Hang on, you can't tell
us what to do.

08:21.500 --> 08:25.500
I just did. You've got 20 minutes to
pack up and leave.

08:26.400 --> 08:30.400
Ha!

08:30.900 --> 08:33.299
Now!

08:33.299 --> 08:37.299
I swear down!

08:45.800 --> 08:47.200
I'm not doing it.

08:47.200 --> 08:51.000
I'm not coming back
to this life, Marty.

08:51.100 --> 08:55.100
Up shit creek
in a barbed wire canoe!

08:55.700 --> 08:59.700
You know what? Fuck it! Let's just
go! We were going to do anyway.

08:59.700 --> 09:01.700
That's when we thought we had
somewhere to go to!

09:01.700 --> 09:03.800
We're back to square one!

09:03.800 --> 09:05.100
I like square ones!

09:05.100 --> 09:08.900
Look, you said so yourself,
the estate's dead from the neck up!

09:09.000 --> 09:12.700
We've got nowt
but the clothes on our back.

09:12.700 --> 09:16.600
That's all we've ever had...

09:16.600 --> 09:20.600
..and at least they're ours.

09:32.400 --> 09:36.400
Give us a hand with this, Jamie.

09:51.200 --> 09:55.200
It stinks here.

09:55.500 --> 09:58.400
I can sort the lekky easy enough.
Maybe get a cleaner in...

09:58.400 --> 10:00.400
We can manage.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.300
It's not quite what
you're used to, is it?

10:02.300 --> 10:06.300
Oh, no, honestly, it's fine.

10:06.700 --> 10:08.700
Look...

10:08.700 --> 10:10.700
we'll be OK.

10:10.700 --> 10:13.300
I'll leave you to it then.

10:13.300 --> 10:17.300
Thanks, Jamie.

10:18.500 --> 10:20.300
I'm going to bagsy a bedroom.

10:20.300 --> 10:24.300
Not before me!

10:35.800 --> 10:39.800
Careful where you put that
lollipop stick.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.500
Who the hell are you lot?

10:54.400 --> 10:56.500
You should've seen the look
on his face when we pulled up.

10:56.600 --> 10:57.900
He's been here before.

10:57.900 --> 11:00.100
Yeah, only for an afternoon.

11:00.200 --> 11:03.500
He might've thought it was colourful
then but now he has to live here.

11:03.500 --> 11:05.400
Kassi's not like that.

11:05.400 --> 11:08.300
No? I never asked to be
dragged into this.

11:08.300 --> 11:11.900
I went for a beer, ended up
sat in handcuffs wondering
what the fuck'sgoing on.

11:11.900 --> 11:13.500
It's not like he planned it.

11:13.500 --> 11:17.500
"Live a little, Jamie."
Like I'm the one needs help.

11:17.600 --> 11:19.900
He treats me
like his fucking driver.

11:20.000 --> 11:20.600
Has she gone then?

11:20.600 --> 11:21.600
Who?

11:21.600 --> 11:23.100
Swear word.

11:23.100 --> 11:24.300
What you talking about?

11:24.300 --> 11:26.100
I'm not going to say her name...

11:26.100 --> 11:29.300
She means Kelly.

11:29.300 --> 11:33.300
She's gone, Lillian.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.500
What was I thinking,
bringing them here?

11:36.500 --> 11:38.900
They needed somewhere to go,
and you found them a place.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.400
It's not exactly a match, is it, the
Blancos and the Chatsworth estate?

11:42.400 --> 11:44.900
It might do you good to spend
a bit more time together.

11:44.900 --> 11:47.000
Going for a few beers I can handle.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
His smug face at my doorstep 24-7
I did not sign up for.

11:57.700 --> 12:01.700
Stella, couple more beers?

12:01.800 --> 12:03.300
How d'you get that?

12:03.300 --> 12:04.500
Twocking.

12:04.500 --> 12:07.900
You hear about that grandma
who got one for playing
Frank Sinatra all the time?

12:07.900 --> 12:11.500
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:11.500 --> 12:13.100
Stella, they're warm!

12:13.100 --> 12:16.400
Oi!

12:16.500 --> 12:19.100
I'll cut your cock off
when I catch you!

12:19.100 --> 12:23.100
This place is messed up.

12:23.900 --> 12:27.900
Stella! I'm gonna
punch your head in!

12:33.600 --> 12:36.200
Ta-da!

12:36.300 --> 12:39.500
Took a lot of guts to come here, you
know? Never been of my own accord.

12:39.500 --> 12:41.600
Don't be so bloody soft, Shane.

12:41.600 --> 12:43.700
What?

12:43.700 --> 12:47.700
Just want to finish what
we nearly started.

12:48.700 --> 12:50.900
- They had you in as well, Maguire?
- No, Jack.

12:50.900 --> 12:51.900
Wankers.

12:51.900 --> 12:54.700
Yeah.

12:54.800 --> 12:58.300
Absolutely.

12:58.300 --> 13:01.800
Look, I've gotta go back to work.

13:01.800 --> 13:05.800
Might nip to the bogs
for a diddle first, though.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.800
Gastric Bandits?

13:21.800 --> 13:24.700
Bloody hell, Frank,
could you be any more offensive?

13:24.700 --> 13:26.800
No, no, they love it.

13:26.800 --> 13:30.700
I love it. Once a week
we get up to all sorts, fantastic.

13:30.700 --> 13:34.700
It's mutually beneficial,
and we have an agreement.

13:35.600 --> 13:38.900
Mind you, might have to find
a new venue now, though.

13:38.900 --> 13:41.400
Oh, don't worry about that.
We'll be gone before you know it.

13:41.400 --> 13:44.600
Oh, that's a shame.

13:44.600 --> 13:48.300
A little nonsense now and then is
relished by the wisest men.

13:50.600 --> 13:52.300
Ever tried a wigwam?

13:52.300 --> 13:56.300
What's that?

14:09.200 --> 14:13.200
Me and Kassi tried it once with
a woman we met in Marrakech.

14:16.200 --> 14:20.200
C'est Kassi nouveau. Utilisez ce
numero, les policiers ont l'autre.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.900
Ta.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.500
Are these mushrooms any good?

14:31.500 --> 14:35.500
Any good? They're Amsterdam
shit yer pants good!

14:41.700 --> 14:43.900
Oh, my God!

14:43.900 --> 14:45.300
Strong, aren't they?

14:45.300 --> 14:49.300
They are, yeah.

14:54.400 --> 14:58.400
Me Mam used to do that...

15:03.100 --> 15:07.100
Frank?

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
I let her down, Esther.
I let her down.

15:16.200 --> 15:20.200
Don't cry, Frank. Here,
let me get you another drink.

15:23.100 --> 15:24.200
Got none.

15:24.200 --> 15:28.200
There's a shop in the square.

15:33.900 --> 15:37.900
Oh, God.

15:47.200 --> 15:51.200
Oh.

15:56.600 --> 15:57.900
Miss her?

15:57.900 --> 15:59.700
Miss who, love?

15:59.700 --> 16:01.100
Swear word.

16:01.100 --> 16:04.000
She was like a daughter to me.

16:04.100 --> 16:06.200
Apart from the prostitute bit.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.700
She stole from you.

16:07.700 --> 16:11.700
That's family for you.

16:14.100 --> 16:17.100
You told your mum about
them moving in yet?

16:17.100 --> 16:18.500
Been avoiding it.

16:18.500 --> 16:20.900
He's made it pretty clear
what he thinks of Mam.

16:20.900 --> 16:23.900
He'll say something smartarse,
she'll say something insulting.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.400
And then I'll have to sort it.
Again.

16:26.400 --> 16:30.400
It'll be worse if Mimi
sniffs them out first.

16:30.900 --> 16:32.400
I'll go round tomorrow.

16:32.400 --> 16:36.400
I'm seeing the words shit and fan...

16:36.700 --> 16:38.100
Get away, boy!

16:40.000 --> 16:41.900
No, get away.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.800
Down boy, down.

16:44.800 --> 16:48.800
Tam?

16:48.900 --> 16:50.400
Whose is this dog?

16:50.400 --> 16:52.200
Woof woof!

16:52.200 --> 16:53.700
What's going on out here?

16:53.700 --> 16:57.200
He's my lad. Tam,
get inside the house!

16:57.200 --> 17:01.200
No worries, love. We've all been
there. A son wouldn't be a son

17:01.300 --> 17:04.400
if he didn't go off the rails
every now and again.

17:04.400 --> 17:06.000
So you're our new neighbours?

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
We are, yeah. I'm Esther Blanco. My
husband's Jamie Maguire's brother.

17:10.099 --> 17:11.500
Bit of a funny story, actually.

17:11.500 --> 17:14.400
He's only just found out he's got
a brother, turns out his mum

17:14.400 --> 17:17.500
had a threesome, totally forgot
that her husband had been up her...

17:17.500 --> 17:19.400
I'll stop you there, love.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.000
I'm Mimi.

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
I'm Jamie's mother!

17:29.500 --> 17:30.900
What's he on?

17:30.900 --> 17:33.000
Industrial strength mushrooms.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.100
Forgot to mention, your new
stepmum's Chatsworth's answer

17:36.100 --> 17:38.400
to Pablo Escobar,

17:38.500 --> 17:42.500
only she's got a bigger 'tache.

18:05.200 --> 18:08.300
Even God got to relax on a Sunday.

18:08.300 --> 18:11.000
What's this shite
they've got on anyway?

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
I like it. What's this
shite you're reading?

18:18.100 --> 18:22.100
Thalia, turn that down!

18:22.400 --> 18:26.400
Aargh!

18:28.200 --> 18:31.500
Easier to train a dog than
a Saul, eh, Tam?

18:31.500 --> 18:35.500
Yeah, if you're going to do drugs,
don't get caught.

18:36.900 --> 18:39.400
Milkman.

18:39.400 --> 18:41.100
Hi, I thought you might er...

18:41.100 --> 18:42.600
Hi Frank, you eaten?

18:42.600 --> 18:45.800
No.

18:45.800 --> 18:49.600
Christening the new abode
last night, were we?

18:49.600 --> 18:53.600
Walls, paper thin.

19:01.100 --> 19:03.200
What is it?

19:03.200 --> 19:07.200
He'll expect Waitrose,
not bloody Chesco.

19:10.700 --> 19:12.900
Is that tramp living here now?

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
Leave him alone. I like Cha Cha.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.500
Ring me.

19:19.500 --> 19:21.100
Still no joy?

19:21.100 --> 19:23.800
Well, it's Sunday morning.
It's earlier in France.

19:23.800 --> 19:25.100
All right, pal?

19:25.100 --> 19:28.000
Careful Frank,
he's a zero-watt bulb.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.400
Fancy a game of idiots, Cha Cha?

19:30.400 --> 19:33.000
Go on then, how do you play it?

19:33.100 --> 19:35.600
Saul, here!

19:35.600 --> 19:39.600
Don't ever do that again,
you hear me?

19:39.800 --> 19:43.800
Go to the shop round the corner
and get some eggs.

19:44.500 --> 19:48.000
Could have been worse, Frank.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.200
Come in, come in.

19:49.200 --> 19:51.800
I'm Karen - we've just brought
you some bits...

19:51.900 --> 19:53.700
Oh, thank you, you didn't have to...

19:53.700 --> 19:56.000
All right, Jamie.
Just welcoming the family.

19:56.000 --> 19:56.900
Yeah, piss off, Frank.

19:56.900 --> 20:00.900
Yeah, will do.

20:02.200 --> 20:04.900
I found this baby oil.
Can I rub it on your arse cheeks?

20:04.900 --> 20:08.900
How much of that book have you read?

20:09.800 --> 20:13.800
Oh, babe.

20:13.900 --> 20:15.800
I do understand, you know.

20:15.800 --> 20:19.400
How it feels when your chicks
have flown the nest.

20:19.400 --> 20:21.400
You comparing my kids to ducks?

20:21.400 --> 20:23.100
All right to have
a quick shower, Mam?

20:23.100 --> 20:27.100
Why not. Every other fucker's
interrupted me peace.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.700
Fucking hell, Mam, what you doing?

20:36.700 --> 20:40.700
Do you know anything about our Jamie
and those arseholes next door?

20:40.900 --> 20:44.800
Yeah, he borrowed the
van off me yesterday.

20:44.800 --> 20:46.900
And I'm the last one to know as per?

20:47.000 --> 20:50.300
How am I supposed to know
that you didn't know?

20:50.300 --> 20:53.600
You would if any of you bothered
coming to see me any more.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.700
I'm here now, aren't I?

20:55.700 --> 20:58.700
Are you here to see me
or use the facilities?

20:58.700 --> 21:00.900
This place isn't a hotel, you know.

21:00.900 --> 21:03.300
Hotels have locks on the doors!

21:03.300 --> 21:05.400
Don't forget to wash your bell end.

21:05.400 --> 21:09.400
Piss off!

21:12.900 --> 21:16.200
You don't want to encourage Frank,
you know. He's a parasite.

21:16.200 --> 21:18.700
Ah, it's fine. Esther's fond of him.

21:18.700 --> 21:20.100
You'll never get rid.

21:20.100 --> 21:22.300
We'll be away soon anyway.

21:22.300 --> 21:25.300
Oh, yeah, the big mystery.

21:25.400 --> 21:28.800
No, no. No mystery.
We're going to France.

21:28.800 --> 21:32.400
I've got an investment out there,
just about ripe.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.700
You think the police are gonna
let you jet off

21:34.700 --> 21:36.500
and enjoy the European vibe?

21:36.500 --> 21:38.200
Why are you so bothered?

21:38.200 --> 21:40.200
I was sat in handcuffs
day before yesterday.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.800
If you've dragged me into this shit,
I want to know about it.

21:42.800 --> 21:46.600
You drag yourself into shit if our
night out is anything to go by.

21:46.700 --> 21:48.300
What's that supposed to mean?

21:48.300 --> 21:51.000
Wouldn't you love to know?

21:51.000 --> 21:53.700
Can you not just answer
a straight fucking question?

21:53.700 --> 21:56.800
Calm down. Keep moving,
that's my motto.

21:56.800 --> 21:58.800
No point hanging around.

21:58.900 --> 22:01.600
"Stop you right there, love.
I'm Jamie's mother!"

22:01.600 --> 22:04.900
Wish I'd been there.

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
Got them!

22:13.800 --> 22:15.900
Well at least they're eggs.

22:15.900 --> 22:19.800
You lot, outside.

22:19.800 --> 22:21.200
Coffee?

22:21.300 --> 22:23.100
No, ta, best get off.
Need to see me mum.

22:23.100 --> 22:24.400
Have some breakfast first.

22:24.400 --> 22:28.400
Yeah, Mimi won't feed you.

22:46.500 --> 22:47.900
What do you think you're doing?

22:47.900 --> 22:49.100
Chillaxing.

22:49.100 --> 22:51.100
That hot tub belongs to me.

22:51.100 --> 22:52.200
It's in our garden.

22:52.200 --> 22:54.000
Are you our new grandma?

22:54.000 --> 22:56.300
No, I'm your worst nightmare.

22:56.300 --> 22:59.400
Now get out of there.

22:59.500 --> 23:01.700
Get out!

23:01.700 --> 23:03.300
Get out!

23:03.300 --> 23:07.300
OK, pipe down, saggy tits.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.900
I'll drag you outta there,
you little dipstick.

23:10.900 --> 23:14.900
Mam! Mam!

23:16.000 --> 23:17.700
What you doing?

23:20.700 --> 23:24.100
Don't ever lay a finger on him
again! Or any of them!

23:24.100 --> 23:27.900
Or what?! And what the fuck are you
playing at moving them in?!

23:27.900 --> 23:29.800
I'm just helping them out.
He's family.

23:29.800 --> 23:32.200
Not my fucking family!

23:32.200 --> 23:33.600
Morning...

23:33.600 --> 23:35.000
Ah, another Maguire boy!

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
You any better at keeping
your mother under control?

23:37.100 --> 23:39.400
- What?
- He's my husband!

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
You're proper giving me tinnitus.

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
Get that hot tub back in my yard,
pronto!

23:52.300 --> 23:56.300
I'll sort this.

24:00.900 --> 24:02.400
What you doing?

24:02.400 --> 24:03.600
Thought you'd want to see me.

24:03.600 --> 24:05.400
Not here!

24:05.400 --> 24:09.400
Put your hands down my pants.
I dare you.

24:09.500 --> 24:11.100
Cuff me.

24:11.100 --> 24:13.300
Oh, you dirty bastard.

24:13.300 --> 24:15.200
What's going on?

24:15.300 --> 24:18.000
It's all cool, Mam, I've just
got to answer some questions

24:18.000 --> 24:19.500
about Shane's World.

24:19.500 --> 24:23.400
Boys will be boys, eh, Mimi?

24:23.400 --> 24:25.300
You - get in, dickhead.

24:25.300 --> 24:26.700
But...

24:26.700 --> 24:30.700
NOW!

24:34.600 --> 24:38.600
They've got one of those big
plasmas next door.

24:45.800 --> 24:49.800
Need to nip this in the bud, Frank,
she's getting out of control.

24:52.500 --> 24:56.500
? Confusion in her eyes that says it
all, she's lost control

24:58.900 --> 25:02.800
? And she's clinging to the nearest
passer by, she's lost control... ?

25:09.200 --> 25:12.300
You're really putting your mum
through it, you know.

25:12.400 --> 25:16.400
Look, it's hard for her, watching
you grow up, make bad decisions.

25:17.900 --> 25:20.400
I'm sorry for putting you
through it.

25:20.400 --> 25:23.800
Doesn't bother me. I actually
think they're all right.

25:23.800 --> 25:26.100
Kids seem like a right laugh.

25:26.100 --> 25:29.900
It's just, hard for your Mum,
you know?

25:29.900 --> 25:31.200
Really?

25:31.300 --> 25:33.600
Just buy her a bunch of flowers
every now and then.

25:33.600 --> 25:36.600
You know, show her that you care.

25:36.600 --> 25:40.500
I'll do me best.

25:40.500 --> 25:43.200
I'm glad we can have
a chat like this, you know,

25:43.200 --> 25:45.800
father to son.

25:45.800 --> 25:49.800
See you later, mate.

25:51.400 --> 25:55.400
Oh, mmm. Oh, God, yeah.
Like that, like that.

25:56.100 --> 25:58.300
Ahhhh!

25:58.300 --> 26:01.800
Juliet Bravo! Jane Tennison!

26:01.800 --> 26:05.800
Cagney and Lacey! Dave...
Cree...gan!

26:08.400 --> 26:10.200
Aaaaah!

26:10.300 --> 26:14.300
Fuck.

26:17.700 --> 26:21.700
Right. Back to work.

26:21.800 --> 26:23.400
What?

26:23.400 --> 26:24.400
What about me?

26:24.400 --> 26:28.400
You can wank on me tits,
but you'll have to be quick.

26:28.600 --> 26:32.600
Right.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.200
'Any units near the Chatsworth
Estate, please proceed...'

26:40.200 --> 26:42.600
Tell you what,
why don't we save it for later?

26:42.600 --> 26:44.300
I love a messy cream pie.

26:44.300 --> 26:48.300
I'll be there in three minutes, guv.

26:52.400 --> 26:55.400
Try it again.

27:03.700 --> 27:07.100
Boarding pass.
So your ferry leaves on Tuesday?

27:07.200 --> 27:11.200
Yes. Cherbourg is nearer to
Brittany that Caen, isn't it?

27:11.500 --> 27:15.500
How would I know
with my dull little life?

27:15.800 --> 27:18.800
Mind if I check my e-mails
while I'm here?

27:18.800 --> 27:20.200
Knock yourself out.

27:28.500 --> 27:32.500
Here you are, lads. Watch this.

27:38.600 --> 27:42.600
In three, two, one...

27:47.100 --> 27:50.500
He's pure mental!

27:50.500 --> 27:52.700
How's it going, fella?
Nice to see you.

27:52.700 --> 27:54.700
Nice to see you, mate.

27:54.700 --> 27:56.700
Do you know him?

27:56.700 --> 28:00.700
Apparently, yeah.

28:13.000 --> 28:17.000
Sorry, love,
this is a no smoking area.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.600
Who the hell does she think she is?!

28:19.600 --> 28:23.400
I know, you can
smoke in here.

28:23.500 --> 28:27.500
Mmmm.

28:34.300 --> 28:37.700
Go in there and ask Mimi
if she's ever done space docking.

28:37.700 --> 28:39.400
Space docking?!

28:41.100 --> 28:45.100
Mate - she'll go sick!

28:45.800 --> 28:48.000
I like them.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.600
Two pair for £7, Wigan Market.

28:49.600 --> 28:54.400
Mimi, have you ever
done space docking?

28:54.400 --> 28:56.600
Fucking space docking?!

28:56.600 --> 29:00.600
Coming round here, corrupting
our kids! Lowering the tone!

29:03.800 --> 29:07.800
I don't know where you come from,
but this is a nice estate,

29:08.300 --> 29:11.100
for nice people!

29:11.100 --> 29:12.100
Calm down, Mam.

29:12.100 --> 29:15.900
Calm down? Shut the fuck up, Judas!

29:15.900 --> 29:17.100
What's that mean?

29:17.100 --> 29:18.700
You know exactly what it means.

29:18.800 --> 29:22.700
It's just kids mucking about.
What's it matter?

29:22.700 --> 29:26.700
It matters to me!

29:32.300 --> 29:34.700
Billy, home!

29:34.700 --> 29:36.000
But it's my turn.

29:36.000 --> 29:40.000
I won't tell you again...

29:55.800 --> 29:57.000
It's not funny.

29:57.000 --> 30:01.000
Oh, it is though, Esther.

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
What's wrong?

30:07.000 --> 30:11.000
Kassi!

30:14.000 --> 30:18.000
Fuck sake.

30:18.700 --> 30:21.800
Dad, what's the matter?

30:21.800 --> 30:24.300
Kassi?

30:24.300 --> 30:28.300
Kassi? Where you going, mate?!

30:28.700 --> 30:32.700
Hey!

30:41.600 --> 30:45.600
Kassi! Stop! What you doing?

30:46.400 --> 30:47.800
What the fuck's going on?

30:47.800 --> 30:49.800
It has nothing to do with you!

30:49.800 --> 30:52.700
Really? Feels like it's got
everything to do with me.

30:52.700 --> 30:55.000
My family, my pub, my fucking world.

30:55.100 --> 30:57.100
Know whose that is?

30:57.100 --> 30:58.200
No.

30:58.200 --> 31:02.200
Good.

31:02.400 --> 31:03.500
Coming?

31:11.300 --> 31:12.900
I mean, where were you going?

31:12.900 --> 31:14.000
France.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.500
I meant, in this.

31:15.500 --> 31:17.800
Before you realised
the tank was empty?

31:17.800 --> 31:19.300
Fight or flight, Jamie.

31:19.300 --> 31:20.900
You don't know where you're going,

31:20.900 --> 31:23.800
you don't know what you're doing,
what do you know?

31:23.800 --> 31:25.800
Fuck all. That's the truth,
isn't it?

31:25.800 --> 31:29.500
You cause chaos and expect everyone
else to clean up your mess.

31:29.500 --> 31:31.200
I never asked for your help!

31:31.300 --> 31:32.900
It didn't stop you taking it!

31:32.900 --> 31:35.900
I've been chasing your tail
for two days and are you grateful?

31:35.900 --> 31:39.700
Are you fuck!

31:39.700 --> 31:42.100
Oh yeah, that's it, walk away.

31:42.100 --> 31:44.400
Where are you gonna run to
this time, eh?

31:44.400 --> 31:48.400
Spain, Mexico, Kuala fucking Lumpur?

31:53.200 --> 31:56.900
Yeah, you sit there coming up
with your next big story.

32:00.800 --> 32:04.800
I don't know what to do.

32:22.900 --> 32:25.100
Where's Dad?

32:25.100 --> 32:29.100
Don't worry, he'll be back.

32:41.700 --> 32:44.100
So what was this big idea?

32:44.100 --> 32:45.700
Pear cider,

32:45.700 --> 32:48.600
invested in a couple
of units in Brittany.

32:48.700 --> 32:52.700
Are you taking the piss?

32:52.900 --> 32:55.800
You really are a screw-up.

32:55.800 --> 32:58.300
I never lost this much before.

32:58.300 --> 33:02.200
Always had a back-up, never thought
it would all go to shit all at once.

33:02.200 --> 33:05.800
I don't know how you live day
to day like that, I really don't.

33:05.900 --> 33:09.900
Well, that's because your apron
strings are still umbilical cords.

33:10.300 --> 33:12.600
Family's family.

33:12.600 --> 33:15.700
I'm not sure mine will be
that pleased to see me.

33:15.700 --> 33:17.200
You'll be all right.

33:17.200 --> 33:19.200
Esther and the kids adore you,

33:19.200 --> 33:23.200
think the sun shines out
of your arse. Fuck knows why.

33:27.300 --> 33:29.600
Look...

33:29.600 --> 33:32.200
I might need to hang around
for a while.

33:32.200 --> 33:34.200
Just until I get back on my feet.

33:34.200 --> 33:38.200
If you can make things right with
Mam, then, maybe it could work.

33:44.700 --> 33:47.400
One more thing...

33:47.400 --> 33:50.600
What did happen,
the night we went out?

33:50.600 --> 33:54.600
Anyone ever tell you you
worry too much?

34:05.900 --> 34:09.500
That how you deal with all your
problems, just throw food at it?

34:09.500 --> 34:13.500
I've lived in a war zone
and I don't fancy doing it again.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.199
Saul, take these round to Mimi,
tell her you're sorry.

34:20.199 --> 34:21.900
Oh, do I have to?

34:22.000 --> 34:26.000
Yes.

34:27.400 --> 34:28.600
Will you come with me Cha Cha?

34:28.600 --> 34:32.199
Yeah.

34:32.199 --> 34:36.199
Don't forget to invite
her for dinner, eight o'clock.

34:36.400 --> 34:40.199
Tell your mother
she can stick it up her arse!

34:40.300 --> 34:43.900
And you turn up to work
looking like that, Gallagher,

34:43.900 --> 34:47.900
and I'll cut your knackers off.

34:49.300 --> 34:53.300
Do you think she'll come?

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
I'm gonna fuck you like you've
never been fucked before.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.300
Shane?

35:04.300 --> 35:08.300
Fuck, it's Jamie, hide!

35:13.300 --> 35:14.400
You all right towel head?

35:14.400 --> 35:15.500
You all right?

35:15.500 --> 35:16.800
Aye.

35:16.800 --> 35:19.000
Fuck me, have you
ODed on Viagra or something?

35:19.100 --> 35:20.900
Nah, nah, nah, it's just...

35:20.900 --> 35:24.900
..sit down, take the weight
off your head.

35:29.300 --> 35:31.800
How's it going with Ali Baba, then?

35:31.800 --> 35:35.300
Total disaster.
Mam's going mental.

35:35.300 --> 35:38.900
That's good...

35:39.000 --> 35:40.600
What's good?

35:40.600 --> 35:43.200
Mam... Ali Baba.

35:43.200 --> 35:44.300
What's up with you?

35:44.300 --> 35:48.300
Nothing, why?

35:49.600 --> 35:52.600
Are you banging that pig?

35:52.600 --> 35:54.000
She's not a pig.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.500
And no, I'm not.

35:55.600 --> 35:56.900
Is she a copper?

35:56.900 --> 35:58.100
Yes, technically...

35:58.100 --> 35:59.900
Well, then she's a pig.

35:59.900 --> 36:01.500
Is she here?!

36:01.500 --> 36:03.500
It's got nothing to do with you.

36:03.500 --> 36:07.500
Oh, don't you fucking tell me
that as well.

36:08.300 --> 36:11.700
For fucks sake!

36:11.700 --> 36:15.700
Argh!

36:29.900 --> 36:32.400
I will have to save this one for the
wank bank,

36:32.400 --> 36:34.800
leave you to it, boys.

36:34.900 --> 36:38.900
Get fucking off me!

36:40.800 --> 36:44.100
Maybe Mimi could sit next to Saul?

36:44.100 --> 36:46.100
Stop it.
You promised you'd try.

36:52.100 --> 36:55.300
Haven't had a chance to give you
a proper welcome. I'm Lillian.

36:55.400 --> 36:59.200
A little something for you.

36:59.200 --> 37:01.900
Isn't that kind?

37:01.900 --> 37:05.800
Thought you'd like it.
It's filthy.

37:05.800 --> 37:09.800
Lillian, would you like to come
to dinner this evening?

37:09.800 --> 37:12.000
You can be our uninvited guest.

37:12.100 --> 37:13.400
You mean, I'm not invited?

37:13.400 --> 37:15.100
Sorry?

37:15.100 --> 37:16.800
If I'm uninvited.

37:16.800 --> 37:19.100
It's a Jewish thing.
Eight o'clock?

37:19.100 --> 37:22.500
Lovely. I'll bring a bottle
of bubbly.

37:22.500 --> 37:26.500
Ciao for now.

37:28.400 --> 37:32.400
Why do I get the feeling you're not
taking this seriously?

37:33.800 --> 37:37.800
Are you going round the Wankos
later then, Frank?

37:38.400 --> 37:39.900
You?

37:39.900 --> 37:40.900
Am I shite.

37:40.900 --> 37:42.200
Well, I think you should.

37:42.200 --> 37:43.300
Why's that?

37:43.300 --> 37:45.900
You're a religious lady, Mimi,

37:45.900 --> 37:49.900
love thy neighbour and don't sell
mushrooms to their kids.

37:51.600 --> 37:54.100
You better keep that
to yourself, Gallagher,

37:54.100 --> 37:56.300
you know what side
your bread's buttered.

37:56.300 --> 37:58.000
Indeed I do.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.600
Amos, sort your bloody uniform out,

38:01.600 --> 38:05.600
you look like nobody's child.

38:06.400 --> 38:08.000
Are you all right, gorgeous?

38:08.100 --> 38:11.900
No, I'm sick of people telling me
I should go round there tonight.

38:11.900 --> 38:14.600
Whoever it is, I agree with them.

38:14.600 --> 38:16.300
Why not?

38:16.300 --> 38:18.900
Why should I be the one
to make an effort?

38:18.900 --> 38:20.200
I'm the victim in all this!

38:20.200 --> 38:22.000
Just give them a chance.

38:22.000 --> 38:26.000
No point shitting on
your own doorstep.

38:48.600 --> 38:52.000
Look's like Mum's coming to this
dinner tonight, after all.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.300
What changed her mind?

38:53.300 --> 38:54.900
Dunno.

38:54.900 --> 38:57.800
Tonight at eight, be there.

38:57.800 --> 39:01.200
Listen, I would love to help.

39:01.200 --> 39:04.100
But I really don't see
myself as a diplomatic sort.

39:04.100 --> 39:07.600
Plus, I am definitely
on a promise tonight.

39:07.700 --> 39:11.700
I think, if I cancel, my balls
just might explode.

39:11.900 --> 39:13.300
I need back-up.

39:13.300 --> 39:17.300
Plus, I'll tell Mam you're shagging
a pig if you don't come.

39:17.800 --> 39:21.800
Bollocks!

39:29.600 --> 39:33.400
You smell great. Like erm...

39:33.400 --> 39:36.900
..strawberry laces.

39:36.900 --> 39:40.000
It's not as good
as Jane Eyre laid bare.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.300
Ta.

39:42.400 --> 39:44.100
Where have you two been?

39:44.100 --> 39:45.400
Reminiscing.

39:45.400 --> 39:47.700
You're brave for inviting this lot
round, aren't you?

39:47.700 --> 39:51.700
Ah, well, you're a brave lot
for coming.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.600
Like waiting for the executioner.

40:03.700 --> 40:06.000
Is he coming too?

40:07.900 --> 40:11.900
Brace yourselves.

40:16.700 --> 40:18.200
Hi, are you all right?

40:18.200 --> 40:19.800
Yeah, come in, come in.

40:19.800 --> 40:21.500
Why don't you put her down upstairs?

40:21.600 --> 40:25.000
Cheers.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.200
Look at you all dressed up.

40:28.200 --> 40:32.200
Even Saul's impressed.

40:39.200 --> 40:41.600
Ah, the guest of honour.

40:41.700 --> 40:43.900
Whose side are you here for?

40:43.900 --> 40:46.200
I'm the uninvited.

40:46.200 --> 40:49.000
She's the fucking brain dead.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.100
Can I borrow your phone Uncle Jamie?

40:51.100 --> 40:53.100
Course you can, mate.

40:53.100 --> 40:56.400
Oh! Bonjour tout le monde.

40:56.400 --> 40:57.700
No French allowed Frank.

40:57.700 --> 40:59.000
D'accord.

40:59.100 --> 41:00.600
You're over there.

41:00.600 --> 41:02.700
Aidan not coming?

41:02.700 --> 41:04.500
Thankfully, no.

41:04.500 --> 41:07.400
He lacks the complex attributes
required to make a person

41:07.400 --> 41:08.700
socially attractive.

41:08.700 --> 41:11.800
And he's got a tag.

41:11.800 --> 41:13.600
Well, this is very cosy, isn't it?

41:13.600 --> 41:14.900
Family gathering...

41:14.900 --> 41:16.900
..should have a game of charades.

41:16.900 --> 41:19.000
I'm good at that. Can I go first?

41:19.100 --> 41:21.000
Two words...

41:21.000 --> 41:25.000
..fuck off.

41:34.700 --> 41:37.100
Are you lot taking the piss?

41:37.200 --> 41:38.700
That takes me back.

41:38.700 --> 41:41.600
It's not what you think,
I drew it for Frank.

41:41.600 --> 41:43.400
Whose side are you on then, Frank?

41:43.400 --> 41:45.600
I think I'm the one on the bottom.

41:45.600 --> 41:47.700
I meant here, you pleb.

41:47.700 --> 41:50.300
I'm Switzerland.

41:50.300 --> 41:53.600
This is, er, really nice, Esther.

41:53.600 --> 41:55.300
Better than your Mum's?

41:55.400 --> 41:59.200
Nah, it's not better, it's just...

41:59.200 --> 42:00.500
It's just what?

42:00.500 --> 42:02.000
Different!

42:02.000 --> 42:04.700
Try some Borek, Mimi?

42:04.700 --> 42:06.800
Er, I've got plenty, thank you.

42:06.800 --> 42:08.300
Are you sure, babe, this is mint.

42:08.300 --> 42:09.800
Had a big lunch at school.

42:09.800 --> 42:12.100
Jamie mentioned you helped
out at the local primary.

42:12.100 --> 42:14.700
It's a bit more than
fucking helping out.

42:14.800 --> 42:17.300
Must be a handful,
dealing with kids from round here.

42:17.300 --> 42:20.200
It's not so much the "round here"
that's the problem.

42:20.200 --> 42:23.200
Once you get them in,
they're putty in your hands.

42:23.200 --> 42:27.200
I find it's back at home
where the real issues lie.

42:27.700 --> 42:28.900
I've found it.

42:28.900 --> 42:31.500
The term space docking
refers to a man...

42:33.600 --> 42:37.600
I'm finished. I'm gonna see Aidan.

42:39.300 --> 42:41.400
They're making an effort.
Why don't you?

42:41.400 --> 42:42.900
Taking their side again?

42:42.900 --> 42:45.100
Give it a fucking rest, Mam.

42:45.100 --> 42:47.900
Eh, don't talk
to your mum like that.

42:47.900 --> 42:51.400
At least I've still got one son
who hasn't let me down.

42:51.400 --> 42:52.800
Who hasn't let you down!

42:52.900 --> 42:55.100
Well, he's shagging a fucking cop!

42:55.100 --> 42:56.100
He's what?!

42:56.100 --> 42:57.300
I'm really fucking not!

42:59.600 --> 43:01.400
What the fuck are you laughing at?

43:01.400 --> 43:03.400
Who do you think you are, Lady Muck?

43:03.400 --> 43:04.900
Do you think we've had it easy?

43:04.900 --> 43:06.500
Sit down, Esther.

43:06.500 --> 43:09.000
No! She hasn't got
a monopoly on hard lives.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.800
See him, he nursed me and Tam
through meningitis

43:11.900 --> 43:13.400
when he was 18 years old!

43:13.400 --> 43:15.800
And he's Palestinian,
you think that's easy?!

43:15.800 --> 43:17.800
Someone's had a shit in the hot tub.

43:20.600 --> 43:22.400
Is that for the space docking?

43:22.400 --> 43:25.700
What did I tell you?
They're fucking animals.

43:25.700 --> 43:26.700
Was it you?

43:26.700 --> 43:28.100
Why would I grass on myself?

43:28.100 --> 43:30.100
Him! It's gotta be him.

43:30.200 --> 43:31.900
How do we know you didn't do
it yourself?

43:31.900 --> 43:33.900
And why would I do it myself?

43:33.900 --> 43:36.100
To get a reaction like this!

43:36.100 --> 43:40.100
I'm not one to shit on me own
doorstep.

43:42.300 --> 43:44.900
It was me, I'm sorry.

43:44.900 --> 43:48.900
Breakfast burrito.

43:49.200 --> 43:50.400
Saul!

43:50.400 --> 43:54.400
Jesus Christ!

44:00.200 --> 44:03.600
I know you didn't have
a burrito for breakfast.

44:03.600 --> 44:05.300
Why say you did?

44:05.300 --> 44:08.000
Cos I know you put that
shit in the hot tub.

44:08.100 --> 44:09.600
You're accusing me?

44:09.600 --> 44:13.600
Well you did, didn't you?

44:13.600 --> 44:17.600
Well, that stuck up cow needed
a lesson in Chatsworth hospitality.

44:19.400 --> 44:20.800
We look like idiots now.

44:20.800 --> 44:24.700
No, I look like an idiot.
Same as any other day.

44:24.700 --> 44:26.500
Looking to me for sympathy?

44:26.600 --> 44:28.600
What even gave you the idea?

44:28.600 --> 44:31.600
Well, in a way you did.

44:31.600 --> 44:35.600
What, you actually listened
to summat I had to say?

44:36.400 --> 44:40.000
Ah, I love how our relationship
just keeps getting stronger

44:40.000 --> 44:41.400
and stronger...

44:41.400 --> 44:44.800
You gave me the idea to have
a shit in the hot tub, Billy,

44:44.800 --> 44:47.500
don't get carried away,
you fucking nob!

44:49.800 --> 44:53.800
Yes!

44:58.400 --> 44:59.900
Guess I fucked it up again.

44:59.900 --> 45:03.900
I think my stepdad taking a shit
in your hot tub was the low point.

45:07.900 --> 45:10.100
Well, best get him indoors.

45:10.100 --> 45:11.100
Night, Uncle Jamie.

45:11.100 --> 45:12.700
Night, mate.

45:12.700 --> 45:15.100
Thanks, Jamie.

45:15.100 --> 45:17.000
For everything, I mean.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.500
'It's human nature to adapt.

45:19.500 --> 45:22.500
'You might not want change but life
sticks two fingers up at that.

45:22.500 --> 45:26.300
'It happens. Sometimes for better,
sometimes for worse.

45:26.400 --> 45:28.600
'Either way we live with it
and carry on.

45:28.600 --> 45:30.900
'So why spend so much time
worrying about the things

45:30.900 --> 45:32.600
'that could go wrong?

45:32.600 --> 45:35.000
'Stop worrying
and enjoy what you have now.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.700
'Because nobody knows what's
waiting for them on the horizon,

45:37.700 --> 45:39.500
'not even me!'

45:39.500 --> 45:42.600
We're going into business together.
Chesco's getting an upgrade.

45:42.700 --> 45:44.400
Yep... It's a shithole.

45:44.400 --> 45:46.100
I don't want to work in a car wash.

45:46.100 --> 45:48.400
We take three times more than
others make round here.

45:48.400 --> 45:50.200
This place?

45:50.200 --> 45:53.600
Living in the moment, mate,
wouldn't change a thing.

45:53.600 --> 45:55.800
Money laundering,
fraud by misrepresentation...

45:55.800 --> 45:57.500
He's in a fucking police cell!

45:57.500 --> 45:59.200
He'll be back by the end
of the week.

45:59.200 --> 46:01.400
It's a drive through suck shop!

46:01.500 --> 46:04.600
I think I've just signed half my
shop away to an Islamic terrorist.
