00:09.900 --> 00:12.800
# You woke up
this morning #

00:12.835 --> 00:15.265
# Got yourself a gun #

00:15.300 --> 00:20.400
# Your momma always said
you'd be the Chosen One #

00:20.500 --> 00:22.800
# She said you're...
you're one in a million #

00:22.900 --> 00:25.100
# You've got
to burn to shine #

00:25.200 --> 00:28.100
# But you were
born under a bad sign #

00:28.200 --> 00:30.900
# With a blue moon
in your eyes #

00:31.000 --> 00:33.800
# When you
woke up this morning #

00:33.835 --> 00:36.600
# And all that love
had gone #

00:36.700 --> 00:39.800
# Your papa never
told you about #

00:39.835 --> 00:42.265
# Right and wrong #

00:42.300 --> 00:44.600
# But you're...
you're lookin' good, baby #

00:44.700 --> 00:47.000
# I believe that
you're feelin' fine #

00:47.100 --> 00:49.700
# Shame about it,
born under a bad sign #

00:49.735 --> 00:52.165
# With a blue moon
in your eyes #

00:52.200 --> 00:55.465
- # So sing it now #
- # Woke up this morning #

00:55.500 --> 00:59.100
# Got a blue moon...
got a blue moon in your eyes, yeah #

00:59.135 --> 01:01.100
# Woke up this morning #

01:03.100 --> 01:05.850
# You say you woke up
this morning #

01:05.885 --> 01:08.565
# The world
turned upside down #

01:08.600 --> 01:10.800
# Lordy, well,
things ain't been the same #

01:10.835 --> 01:14.100
# Since the blues
walked in our town #

01:14.200 --> 01:16.500
# But you're... but you're
one in a million #

01:16.600 --> 01:19.300
# 'Cause you got that
shotgun shine #

01:19.335 --> 01:22.000
# Shame about it,
born under a bad sign #

01:22.100 --> 01:25.000
# With a blue moon
in your eyes, yeah #

01:25.100 --> 01:28.000
# Woke up
this morning #

01:28.100 --> 01:31.200
- # Uh-huh #
- # And got yourself a gun #

01:31.300 --> 01:34.200
- # Woke up this morning #
- # Got yourself a gun #

01:34.300 --> 01:36.800
- # Uh-huh #
- # Got yourself a gun. #

02:12.200 --> 02:14.800
Ah, that's so funny!
Ha ha.

02:14.900 --> 02:17.500
No, it isn't! You just
poked me in the eye!

02:17.600 --> 02:19.800
Well, you poked me first.

02:19.835 --> 02:22.000
I can't find
the thing.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.200
Here.

02:25.600 --> 02:28.100
I don't know what the fuck
happened to the DeWalt.

02:28.200 --> 02:30.465
Everything disappears
around here.

02:30.500 --> 02:33.600
Especially now that I'm outta the house.
She lets everything go.

02:39.300 --> 02:42.500
Stop, stop, Uncle Tony!
It's freezing cold!

02:42.535 --> 02:44.700
Uncle Tony,
knock it off!

02:49.600 --> 02:52.500
She wants to talk
to me about somethin'.

02:52.600 --> 02:54.800
Thanks for havin' us
up here, Ton'.

03:00.300 --> 03:03.700
Don't put pine cones in the filter!
The hell's the matter with you?

03:05.600 --> 03:08.900
- Yo, Dad, he's hitting me!
- Hey, what did I say?

03:09.000 --> 03:11.900
They will probably go
through their entire lives

03:11.935 --> 03:14.100
not knowing that
their father's sperm

03:14.200 --> 03:16.500
was smuggled out of jail
to get Nancy pregnant.

03:17.500 --> 03:19.500
It was the least
I could do.

03:21.300 --> 03:23.100
I just remembered what
happened to the power drill.

03:23.200 --> 03:24.900
Pardon me?

03:25.000 --> 03:28.400
I loaned it to your cousin Brian.
And he never gave it...

03:30.000 --> 03:33.600
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

03:33.635 --> 03:36.300
One of your attacks?

03:38.800 --> 03:43.400
No, it...
I think it's just indigestion.

03:43.435 --> 03:45.900
It's goin' away.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.500
- I had an attack... full blown.
- What did your therapist say?

03:54.600 --> 03:56.400
- I don't see her no more.
- Why not?

03:56.500 --> 03:58.700
You think you're the only
one that has to cut back

03:58.800 --> 04:01.200
on shit they need
'cause of the separation?

04:02.900 --> 04:04.800
Now, what's
on your mind?

04:06.600 --> 04:09.400
Mr. Wegler wants us
to come in and discuss

04:09.435 --> 04:13.300
AJ's lousy
academic performance.

04:13.400 --> 04:15.200
Is this the same Wegler?

04:15.300 --> 04:18.100
Last year... the riccion
with the Billy Budds?

04:18.135 --> 04:20.065
AJ got him as
a college advisor.

04:20.100 --> 04:22.500
I told this kid to start
crackin' the books.

04:22.535 --> 04:24.865
Was he supposed
to do that after he got back

04:24.900 --> 04:27.350
from the Nets game
you took him to on a school night?

04:27.385 --> 04:29.765
It's gotta be hard for him,
this situation with us.

04:29.800 --> 04:32.700
- Why don't you cut him some slack?
- That's your department.

04:32.800 --> 04:36.400
I get to be the prison warden
over here while you indulge him

04:36.500 --> 04:39.000
- with the iPod, the drums...
- Again with the drums!

04:39.100 --> 04:41.400
Encourage extracurricular
activity, you said.

04:41.500 --> 04:45.100
Brand new drums, just like that?
Don't even look in the classifieds.

04:45.135 --> 04:47.065
Just tell me when
the school meetin' is

04:47.100 --> 04:49.800
'cause I don't have to listen
to this shit anymore.

04:49.900 --> 04:51.900
That's why we're separated!

04:52.000 --> 04:54.200
Are you kidding me, Tony?
That is not why!

04:54.235 --> 04:58.400
Jase?
Were you knocking?

05:00.500 --> 05:03.400
Hi, Lorraine.
I'm Billy.

05:03.435 --> 05:06.300
What the fuck? Jason!

05:06.335 --> 05:09.600
Ow, no!
Jason!

05:09.700 --> 05:12.100
Jason!

05:13.300 --> 05:17.500
Oh, no!

05:21.800 --> 05:25.700
You were warned, Lorraine.
The money goes up to John.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.800
Fuck!

05:44.300 --> 05:47.000
Lorraine Calluzzo
and the kid Jason.

05:47.035 --> 05:49.600
Fuckin'
Philly Leotardo!

05:51.700 --> 05:56.100
She told me he warned her
about givin' us points of her take.

05:56.200 --> 06:00.200
Phil's a pimple.
It's goddamn Johnny Sack.

06:00.300 --> 06:03.200
It's his message to the other captains,
that fuckin' animal.

06:03.235 --> 06:05.800
- Take it easy.
- Fuck that.

06:05.900 --> 06:09.500
Rusty!
The car's here.

06:12.300 --> 06:14.365
I'm telling you,
Carmine,

06:14.400 --> 06:18.665
we go all out, we'll steamroll
right over John.

06:18.700 --> 06:22.800
And I predict the guys on the street
in Brooklyn and Queens,

06:22.835 --> 06:27.400
they'll welcome us as fuckin' heroes.
It'll be easy.

06:27.500 --> 06:30.600
It's a fuckin' declaration of war
by Johnny, if ya ask me.

06:33.200 --> 06:35.165
- Hey!
- Ho.

06:35.200 --> 06:38.265
There he is.
Let me kiss the ring.

06:38.300 --> 06:41.200
How about the one
in the center of my ass?

06:43.500 --> 06:46.400
- Hey.
- Feech, good to see ya, baby.

06:46.435 --> 06:49.265
Good to see you.
Hello there, kid.

06:49.300 --> 06:52.065
- Hey, how are ya, boys?
- How are ya, Feech?

06:52.100 --> 06:55.900
Just, uh... talkin' about that mess
over in New York.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Sounds to me
like your friend John

06:58.035 --> 07:00.000
wants to force
Little Carmine's hand.

07:00.100 --> 07:03.165
In my day, the top spot
would've gone to Little Carmine,

07:03.200 --> 07:07.600
unless he was actually retarded
or crippled or something. He's the son.

07:07.635 --> 07:10.200
Come on, when was that?

07:10.300 --> 07:12.500
Yeah?

07:15.100 --> 07:17.200
- Vodka rocks.
- Thank you, dear.

07:17.235 --> 07:18.500
Anybody else?

07:18.600 --> 07:21.750
If we need anything else,
one of the kids'll come out.

07:21.785 --> 07:24.900
Ton', you didn't have any lunch.
You want a sandwich?

07:24.935 --> 07:26.600
No, I'm all right.
Thanks.

07:29.800 --> 07:31.600
Adriana,
hold on a second.

07:31.635 --> 07:33.600
Tommy Pinto's goomah,

07:33.700 --> 07:37.100
when I was comin' up she had
the long legs, up to here, like that.

07:37.200 --> 07:39.300
Famous beauty,
smart as a whip.

07:42.100 --> 07:43.400
My compliments.

07:43.500 --> 07:45.400
Thank you, baby.

07:45.500 --> 07:47.100
You drove
Tommy Pinto?

07:47.200 --> 07:49.400
I was at the Clam Broth House
the night

07:49.500 --> 07:52.600
he beat that longshoreman
to death over a corner table.

07:52.700 --> 07:55.965
- No shit.
- Here we go... Memory Lane.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.465
It's important these young guys
know the history.

07:58.500 --> 08:02.300
Tell 'em about the time Tony and Jackie
Aprile knocked over your card game.

08:03.600 --> 08:05.565
Oh, that he doesn't
like to talk about.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.500
I heard this.
This is a great fuckin' story.

08:08.535 --> 08:10.800
He should be
dead by now.

08:10.900 --> 08:13.500
They bust in,
couple of fuckin' punks.

08:13.600 --> 08:16.365
Guns out. Bad guys.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.950
This one is
fuckin' scared!

08:18.985 --> 08:21.500
First of all,
it was my game.

08:21.600 --> 08:25.000
Feech has forgiven,
even if he hasn't forgotten.

08:25.100 --> 08:28.200
But it's a great yarn,
right, Feech?

08:28.300 --> 08:30.500
Yeah.

08:31.900 --> 08:34.750
Actually, it brings me
to my business.

08:34.784 --> 08:37.600
Fellas, you wanna
give us a minute here?

08:47.200 --> 08:50.100
Yeah.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.465
So, what's up?

08:52.500 --> 08:54.400
I came to ask
for my game back.

08:54.435 --> 08:56.300
It's my uncle's game
now, Feech.

08:56.400 --> 08:59.100
Yeah right,
your uncle's.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.350
You'll still keep
a lion's share of the rake.

09:01.385 --> 09:03.500
I'm in a way just askin'
if I can run it for ya.

09:03.600 --> 09:06.165
- Why would I need that?
- 11 years I ran it...

09:06.200 --> 09:09.200
no fights, no raids. Not to mention
that maybe I got it comin',

09:09.300 --> 09:12.400
considering how it could've gone for you
after you took the game down

09:12.500 --> 09:13.965
if I had been
a prick about it.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.400
Or if his old man didn't
have so many friends.

09:23.100 --> 09:26.900
I'll give you 20%, but you gotta rent
the house from me.

09:26.935 --> 09:29.500
I could throw some
high rollers your way...

09:29.535 --> 09:31.100
friends of mine.

09:31.135 --> 09:33.965
All right.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.700
Let me get outta here before I keep
talkin' and fuck this up. Jesus.

09:38.735 --> 09:41.200
Thank you,
Don Antonio.

09:52.600 --> 09:55.400
He's a strunz.

09:55.500 --> 09:57.465
He's a busybody,
that's all.

09:57.500 --> 10:00.500
He's an egomaniac, Ton',
always was, always will be.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.065
Nothing's ever good enough...
praise, money.

10:03.100 --> 10:06.100
Comes into this fuckin' office,
starts orderin' people around.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.265
He's old.

10:08.300 --> 10:10.000
How do ya think
that feels?

10:17.700 --> 10:20.165
Can I go to the Mudvayne
concert or not?

10:20.200 --> 10:23.600
I've been trying to think of a reason
to let you stay overnight in New York,

10:23.635 --> 10:25.667
but I'm afraid
it's not gonna happen.

10:25.702 --> 10:27.665
Todd's mother already
made arrangements.

10:27.700 --> 10:30.600
- Said it's better than driving home.
- She's not your mother.

10:30.635 --> 10:33.800
Yeah, I know.
Believe me.

10:33.835 --> 10:36.300
Isn't life unfair?

10:36.400 --> 10:39.265
So we're at
the Peppermint Lounge,

10:39.300 --> 10:42.100
when in walks these two
stewardesses from Braniff.

10:42.200 --> 10:44.300
Everybody's in?
Aces high. Your action, Mr. Taylor.

10:44.400 --> 10:45.865
- 200.
- Hesh?

10:45.900 --> 10:48.965
They're sittin' at the bar.
We send 'em a bottle of Dom.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.700
Next thing ya know, we're in the hotel
room... me, Frankie and the two broads.

10:52.735 --> 10:55.500
- I see ya, raise ya three.
- You mother...

10:55.600 --> 10:58.600
But this one, this little pothead
from Texas, she fucked me dry.

10:58.700 --> 11:01.500
But she still wanted more!
She's fuckin' nuts.

11:01.535 --> 11:03.400
I'm wearin'
these pointy featherweights

11:03.500 --> 11:06.200
and I stick the toe in
and I'm fuckin' her with it.

11:06.300 --> 11:08.065
I don't know where
this story's heading

11:08.100 --> 11:11.000
but we should all be grateful
he wasn't wearing white bucks.

11:11.100 --> 11:14.500
The maid walks in.
She says, "What's goin' on?"

11:14.535 --> 11:16.400
And I say...

11:16.500 --> 11:18.200
Ante up, boys.

11:18.300 --> 11:20.150
Hello, girls!

11:20.185 --> 11:22.092
- Ho!
- Hey!

11:22.127 --> 11:23.965
Hi, Ton'.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
- Sir Lawrence from the Meadowlands.
- Your Highness, how are you?

11:27.100 --> 11:29.400
Tony, let me introduce
Bernie Brillstein.

11:29.435 --> 11:31.800
Did you get my list of toys?

11:31.900 --> 11:35.400
- What's up?
- Hey, Ton'.

11:35.500 --> 11:39.665
Oh, my cousin!
Kinda high stakes for you, no?

11:39.700 --> 11:42.800
Feech fronted my action.
And thank you for not humiliating me.

11:42.835 --> 11:44.300
Isn't there somethin' in your parole

11:44.400 --> 11:46.800
about hangin' out
with degenerates like this?

11:46.835 --> 11:49.200
- Oh!
- Come on, he gets away with anything.

11:49.300 --> 11:51.800
Last time his parole officer
made the unannounced visit,

11:51.835 --> 11:53.700
he gave him a massage.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
So how's Lady Luck
treatin' you, huh?

12:00.100 --> 12:04.500
Jesus-fuckin'- Christ.
How many times this guy gotta say hello?

12:04.535 --> 12:07.500
What, did I interrupt one
of your impermeable stories?

12:09.200 --> 12:11.050
Go ahead.

12:11.085 --> 12:12.865
So...

12:12.900 --> 12:14.765
we had these girls
in the hotel room.

12:14.800 --> 12:18.100
Long story short,
I got my shoe in her snatch...

12:18.200 --> 12:21.600
and it falls off and she keels over.
Che puzz'.

12:28.100 --> 12:31.100
Fuck it.
This hand's from thalidomide.

12:32.600 --> 12:33.900
Three ladies,
gentlemen.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
- Ah!
- Stake it.

12:36.100 --> 12:37.600
- Take it.
- The rich get richer.

12:37.700 --> 12:40.500
So Doc, how's the, uh,
plans for the wedding?

12:40.535 --> 12:43.117
Please. It's not a wedding
planner anymore.

12:43.152 --> 12:45.700
It's an "environment
and event coordinator. "

12:45.735 --> 12:48.600
What the hell.
She's my only daughter.

12:48.700 --> 12:51.550
She and Iris have their hearts set
on makin' the Vows column

12:51.585 --> 12:54.400
of the Sunday "New York Times"...
featured couple of the week.

12:54.435 --> 12:56.465
Our publicist
is lookin' for a hook.

12:56.500 --> 12:59.600
Turns out that Gillian's law degree
from Harvard means bupkis.

12:59.635 --> 13:01.300
Everybody's got
that or better.

13:01.400 --> 13:04.700
If it was a black couple
or a gay couple they'd be in.

13:04.800 --> 13:08.100
My wife calls "The Times" wedding
section the ladies' sports page.

13:08.200 --> 13:09.800
So Ira, who's
the lucky guy?

13:09.900 --> 13:14.265
Jeremy Silverman, puppeteer,
Children's Television Workshop.

13:14.300 --> 13:18.100
Father's Asa Silverman, head
of commercial paper at Goldman Sachs.

13:18.135 --> 13:20.700
- Upper Eastside.
- I didn't get my invitation.

13:26.500 --> 13:29.000
Fuck you.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.900
You told me to be sure

13:41.000 --> 13:42.800
to let you know
when it was a quarter of.

13:42.835 --> 13:44.365
- Thank you, Mary.
- Okay.

13:44.400 --> 13:46.400
So with Wesleyan
as your fallback,

13:46.500 --> 13:48.265
I think we're in
pretty good shape.

13:48.300 --> 13:51.600
Straight "A"s at Middlebury's Language
Camp, can't sneeze at that.

13:51.635 --> 13:54.300
Your blues folkloric studies
in Mississippi last summer

13:54.400 --> 13:56.850
have an almost community-service
spin to them.

13:56.885 --> 13:59.300
I wish he had the minority
thing going for him.

13:59.400 --> 14:02.000
If we can nudge Lem's verbals
past 760 on the next round,

14:02.035 --> 14:03.900
he can basically
write his own ticket.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.700
I'm stoked.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.200
Appreciate
your help.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.500
Folks?

14:14.100 --> 14:17.600
So let me guess... he called
the English teacher "Daddy-o. "

14:17.700 --> 14:19.500
Oh.

14:21.100 --> 14:23.365
The thing is...

14:23.400 --> 14:26.500
we are rapidly
approaching crisis mode here

14:26.600 --> 14:30.500
with these grades,
and time is of the essence.

14:30.600 --> 14:32.400
Could I ask
a question?

14:32.500 --> 14:35.300
I handed in my final list of colleges.
Did you get that?

14:35.400 --> 14:38.300
Yes, we talked
about this.

14:38.335 --> 14:41.165
So, Ramapo
and Trenton State.

14:41.200 --> 14:44.365
And our reach schools,
University of Arizona and Arizona State.

14:44.400 --> 14:47.800
I'll take him out there after I drive
him around to the ones in New Jersey.

14:47.835 --> 14:50.800
If either of the Arizona's is what
he's got his heart set on,

14:50.835 --> 14:52.900
he's not gonna get in
with these grades.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.100
I know about football, Anthony.
That's our ace in the hole.

14:56.135 --> 14:59.117
He says he's tryin'
his best.

14:59.152 --> 15:02.065
S.A.T. -wise,
505 and 430...

15:02.100 --> 15:05.700
I think we can edge up the math
into the fives in the next round,

15:05.735 --> 15:07.700
providing Anthony
can bear down and focus.

15:07.800 --> 15:09.465
He's had trouble
with that before.

15:09.500 --> 15:11.765
Remember, Carm, when they
thought he had A.D.D.?

15:11.800 --> 15:15.450
- You didn't tell me that.
- Head on back to class. Let us talk.

15:15.485 --> 15:19.100
But if I'm learning-disabled,
I get unlimited time on my S.A.T.s.

15:19.135 --> 15:22.300
- Is that true?
- Let's talk about that later.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.565
So you had time to talk

15:35.600 --> 15:38.200
directly to Dr. Rapke about
last week's testing results.

15:38.235 --> 15:40.900
Yes. She said Anthony

15:41.000 --> 15:43.600
has good interpersonal skills.

15:43.635 --> 15:46.165
She said his affect was...

15:46.200 --> 15:49.200
now, where is this...
"constricted," she called it.

15:49.235 --> 15:51.400
But that was normal
for a teenager and...

15:51.500 --> 15:55.000
all in all he seemed to be
handling the split well.

15:55.100 --> 15:58.300
This is not to say I don't get a ration
of shit in every conversation.

15:58.335 --> 16:00.400
Pardon my French.

16:00.500 --> 16:02.000
Well, still, uh...

16:02.100 --> 16:05.765
there is this thing
with his grades.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.900
Do you think it would be
of benefit to him

16:08.000 --> 16:10.600
to see a psychologist
on a regular basis?

16:12.800 --> 16:15.000
You don't approve
of therapy, Mr. Soprano.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.600
People use it
as a crutch.

16:17.700 --> 16:20.200
And I always wonder
what happened to Gary Cooper,

16:20.235 --> 16:22.165
the strong silent type?

16:22.200 --> 16:25.100
Well, Gary Cooper wasn't
a 16-year-old boy.

16:25.200 --> 16:27.300
He was at one time.

16:27.400 --> 16:31.300
And I'm gonna have to agree
with my husband here, Mr. Wegler.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.000
We sent our
daughter to a...

16:33.100 --> 16:35.600
an adolescent developmentalist
and it was a disaster.

16:35.700 --> 16:38.900
I know my son, he's lazy. We're gonna
get him a different S.A.T. tutor,

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
I'm gonna stay on him and he's gonna
work harder. And that's that.

16:43.700 --> 16:47.700
- I might be learning-disabled.
- Didn't he tell you to go to class?

16:47.735 --> 16:50.765
What's going on, Mary?

16:50.800 --> 16:54.065
Domenica Paolini
and Sasha Caputo,

16:54.100 --> 16:57.600
they were on their way to school
this morning and they hit a tree.

16:57.635 --> 17:00.200
Nica's dead.
Sasha's in a coma.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.165
What's that?

17:09.200 --> 17:11.200
It was here
when I got here.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.700
Okay, if a million zeroes
can be written

17:23.734 --> 17:26.000
on the front and back
of a sheet of paper,

17:26.099 --> 17:30.700
how many sheets of paper do you need
for a googol of zeroes?

17:45.100 --> 17:47.665
Whoa!

17:47.700 --> 17:49.665
Oh man, oh baby,
an Xterra SE.

17:49.700 --> 17:52.700
It's loaded.
3.3- liter supercharged.

17:52.800 --> 17:55.100
- What, this is mine?
- Yeah.

17:55.200 --> 17:58.100
- You are unbelievable.
- The sticker's still on it.

17:58.135 --> 18:00.165
He doesn't have
enough distractions?

18:00.200 --> 18:02.500
After what happened
to those kids at his school?

18:02.535 --> 18:04.100
It's got sensors
in the seatbelts.

18:04.200 --> 18:06.800
It's part of Nissan's
triple safety philosophy.

18:06.900 --> 18:09.100
- Nice ride.
- Are you leaving?

18:09.135 --> 18:11.065
Hour's up.

18:11.100 --> 18:13.300
You're not getting in?

18:19.900 --> 18:22.065
This is so deck.
What is this, Bose?

18:22.100 --> 18:24.800
Yeah, six CD changer.
It's got Surround Sound.

18:24.835 --> 18:26.365
I feel safer already.

18:26.400 --> 18:29.100
Carmela,
this car is a tank.

18:30.200 --> 18:32.865
What's the matter?

18:32.900 --> 18:35.165
SUVs eat up
more of the ozone.

18:35.200 --> 18:38.300
So you wanna be the sucker
in a regular car that gets decapitated?

18:38.335 --> 18:41.500
- I'm gonna catch shit at school.
- So what do you wanna do?

18:44.000 --> 18:46.200
Screw it.
Can we take it out?

18:46.300 --> 18:48.465
Yeah, we can take it out.
Once.

18:48.500 --> 18:51.900
Then this baby sits in the garage
till you pull your grades up to a "C."

18:51.935 --> 18:53.900
- What?
- You heard your father.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.800
I was talking to him,
not you.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.900
I gotta put dinner on.
Tony, I have bills for you.

19:06.200 --> 19:08.465
You better be nice
to your mother.

19:08.500 --> 19:12.400
She's got the keys
till your grades are up.

19:12.435 --> 19:14.900
I'll be right back.

19:17.900 --> 19:19.865
The car was
a motivational tool.

19:19.900 --> 19:22.065
The carrot and the stick,
you gotta do both!

19:22.100 --> 19:25.400
I could strangle him sometimes.
He can be so hateful.

19:25.435 --> 19:27.600
Well, the smart mouth
is not good.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.665
That's minor,
believe me.

19:29.700 --> 19:33.100
God, what happened to him?
He was always the sweet one.

19:33.200 --> 19:36.650
He had the concept of sharing before
any of the other toddlers.

19:36.685 --> 19:40.100
Meadow was always sharper, but I
remember the same thing with her.

19:40.135 --> 19:42.600
It's like watching
an angel fall.

19:45.900 --> 19:48.300
What, are you crying?

19:54.700 --> 19:57.800
Here's the tutor in writing
like you had to have.

19:57.900 --> 19:59.265
I had to call
RotoRooter.

19:59.300 --> 20:01.565
This is a cheap sound system
for the media room.

20:01.600 --> 20:04.500
- Why should I pay for that?
- Because you took the last one.

20:04.535 --> 20:07.400
Oh, your little movie connoisseur
friends are still meeting?

20:07.435 --> 20:10.000
- At least I have friends.
- What the fuck's that mean?

20:10.035 --> 20:11.900
You just have
a bunch of flunkies.

20:11.935 --> 20:13.165
What do you
know about it?

20:13.200 --> 20:15.800
They compliment you
on your new shoes.

20:15.900 --> 20:18.100
They tell you that
you're not going bald.

20:18.135 --> 20:19.600
You think
they really care?

20:19.700 --> 20:21.665
You're the boss,
they're scared of you.

20:21.700 --> 20:24.200
They have to kiss your ass,
laugh at your stupid jokes.

20:24.300 --> 20:27.200
What about Artie then?
You're turning into a frigging cynic.

20:27.235 --> 20:30.165
- Whatever.
- What do I give a shit?

20:30.200 --> 20:32.800
I'm running a fucking business
not a popularity contest.

20:32.900 --> 20:35.000
"I've been thinking,

20:35.100 --> 20:38.900
and I apologize for my use
of fowl language"...

20:38.935 --> 20:40.900
fowl with a "W"...

20:41.000 --> 20:43.100
"in regards to yourself.

20:43.200 --> 20:46.500
You said some very
hurtful things to me

20:46.535 --> 20:48.065
in regards to myself.

20:48.100 --> 20:52.200
But it is still no excuse to use
the vile word that I used,

20:52.235 --> 20:55.300
of which
I am sure you know...

20:55.400 --> 20:57.265
that I'm talking about. "

20:57.300 --> 21:00.000
- "Cunt," right?
- Yes, Elliot.

21:03.500 --> 21:06.500
"You don't wish us
to be social friends

21:06.535 --> 21:08.765
and so that is that.

21:08.800 --> 21:12.000
I still have
great rigard for you,

21:12.100 --> 21:14.600
even though you said
some horrible things.

21:14.635 --> 21:17.500
P.S. I'm doing fine,
Anthony. "

21:19.200 --> 21:21.400
It came with a bathrobe

21:21.500 --> 21:24.800
and a basketful of
Dr. Hauschka bath products.

21:24.835 --> 21:26.900
Ablution.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.200
The desire to cleanse
himself of the deed.

21:29.300 --> 21:32.300
Notice he still
fundamentally blames me.

21:40.500 --> 21:44.100
- Hello?
- Mrs. Soprano? Robert Wegler.

21:44.135 --> 21:45.665
Oh, hi, hello,
how are you?

21:45.700 --> 21:47.865
Uh... after our meeting
the other day,

21:47.900 --> 21:51.300
I had some ideas about
some further strategies for Anthony.

21:51.335 --> 21:53.400
I thought maybe
we could meet,

21:53.500 --> 21:57.000
have lunch, cup of coffee.
I could share them with you.

21:57.035 --> 21:59.500
- Next week perhaps?
- Really?

21:59.600 --> 22:02.500
Uh... well yeah, I guess
that would be okay.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.600
"Happy Birthday"
by the Beatles.

22:16.700 --> 22:19.165
You know, I heard it
the other day in the car.

22:19.200 --> 22:22.200
They have such a good drum solo
in the middle there.

22:22.235 --> 22:26.100
"Drum solo"?
That's the basic four-four.

22:28.800 --> 22:32.600
You know Ringo was not their original
drummer. That was Pete Best.

22:32.635 --> 22:34.900
And they fired him.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.100
He put out his own album...
"Best of the Beatles. "

22:38.200 --> 22:41.100
Sad.

22:41.200 --> 22:43.800
So, is this what they call
common ground?

22:45.900 --> 22:49.100
Just trying to have
a civilized conversation.

22:49.200 --> 22:51.000
Can I go to my room?
I'm full.

22:51.100 --> 22:53.165
Am I so horrible?

22:53.200 --> 22:56.965
You are not horrible.
Get over yourself.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.400
"Over myself"?
What is that supposed to mean?

23:01.900 --> 23:04.800
Just go,
do me a big favor.

23:06.800 --> 23:09.400
If you're gonna be a martyr,
obviously I'll sit here.

23:09.435 --> 23:12.000
No, go.
Put your plate in the sink.

23:26.600 --> 23:29.300
200.

23:29.400 --> 23:31.365
Two to go.

23:31.400 --> 23:34.665
- See, and raise four.
- Call.

23:34.700 --> 23:37.600
Tony, you liking the Escalade?
I can't keep them on the lot.

23:37.700 --> 23:39.165
I love it...

23:39.200 --> 23:42.500
after I pulled out that
global positioning shit.

23:42.535 --> 23:43.600
Oh, right.

23:43.700 --> 23:47.300
Always got his eye
on the big picture.

23:47.335 --> 23:49.065
Up to you.

23:49.100 --> 23:52.000
I think you got that ace
and I'm not paying you for it.

23:53.500 --> 23:55.800
- Aces over.
- Three threes, my man.

23:55.835 --> 23:57.900
Paulie wins.
Cards, please.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.400
You, fuck you.

24:00.500 --> 24:03.150
They used to be a great
tax loophole, those SUVs.

24:03.185 --> 24:06.342
Told all my clients,
write it off on your business.

24:06.377 --> 24:09.500
Accountant dies, goes to heaven
same time as the Pope.

24:09.535 --> 24:11.200
St. Peter says
"Come on in!"

24:11.300 --> 24:13.265
Then he shows the Pope
to this shithouse.

24:13.300 --> 24:16.300
That's where he's gonna live,
and he gives him a crust of bread.

24:16.400 --> 24:19.050
Then he shows the C.P.A.
where he's gonna live.

24:19.085 --> 24:21.665
It's a fuckin' mansion...
servants, broads.

24:21.700 --> 24:26.000
Pope says "He gets a mansion
and I get a hovel?"

24:26.035 --> 24:28.167
St. Peter says
"Your Holiness,

24:28.202 --> 24:30.251
we got hundreds
of popes up here.

24:30.286 --> 24:32.300
This is the first
Jewish accountant!"

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
I used to be able
to write off condoms.

24:40.500 --> 24:43.900
What do you get when you cross
an accountant with a giant jet airplane?

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
A Boring 747.

25:10.700 --> 25:13.700
All right, all right,
bet two.

25:15.900 --> 25:18.000
Algebra, huh?

25:20.700 --> 25:23.900
Listen,

25:24.000 --> 25:26.865
I have been doing
some thinking.

25:26.900 --> 25:29.700
I've decided to let you
stay in the city after the concert.

25:29.800 --> 25:32.300
How come?

25:32.400 --> 25:36.300
On one condition, though...
no Hudson Suites.

25:36.400 --> 25:40.150
I talked to Mead, she said that you
can sleep over at her apartment.

25:40.185 --> 25:43.900
I will give you cab fare. When the
concert's over, go straight up there.

25:43.935 --> 25:46.700
Sunday morning,
I want you home 10:30 sharp.

25:46.800 --> 25:48.800
Thanks.

25:51.500 --> 25:53.500
Don't stay up too late.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.500
Come on! Go, go, go!
Hurry!

26:07.600 --> 26:10.700
So, you guys like your job?

26:11.700 --> 26:14.100
Beemer, space 43.

26:18.500 --> 26:21.450
# Siman tov umazel tov,
umazel tov v'siman tov #

26:21.485 --> 26:24.392
# Siman tov umazel tov, umazel tov
v'siman tov #

26:24.427 --> 26:27.300
# Siman tov umazel tov,
umazel tov v'siman tov #

26:27.335 --> 26:30.217
# Y'hei lanu... #

26:30.252 --> 26:33.065
Asa, come on!

26:33.100 --> 26:35.950
#... Ul'chol yisra-el #

26:35.985 --> 26:38.800
# Y'hei lanu y'hei lanu #

26:38.900 --> 26:42.065
# Ul'chol yisra-el #

26:42.100 --> 26:45.000
# Siman tov umazel tov,
umazel tov v'siman tov #

26:45.100 --> 26:48.050
# Siman tov umazel tov, umazel
tov v'siman tov #

26:48.085 --> 26:51.000
# Siman tov umazel tov,
umazel tov v'siman tov #

26:51.100 --> 26:53.800
# Y'hei lanu #

26:53.900 --> 26:57.000
# Y'hei lanu
y'hei lanu... #

26:58.900 --> 27:01.300
Can I have your attention?

27:03.300 --> 27:06.400
Apparently there's
been an armed robbery.

27:06.435 --> 27:09.800
Some automobiles
were taken.

27:12.100 --> 27:14.765
They left all
the American cars!

27:14.800 --> 27:16.850
- Oh my God.
- I think his skull is broken.

27:16.885 --> 27:18.900
- Oh my God!
- I'm a doctor, let me in there.

27:18.935 --> 27:20.900
Brooke,
our car is gone.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.800
Now who's a genius
for keeping his Regal?

27:23.835 --> 27:25.900
Asa, they got the SL.

27:27.800 --> 27:30.265
That was a fucking
SL55 convertible.

27:30.300 --> 27:33.700
You know how long my brother
was on the waiting list for that thing?

27:33.800 --> 27:35.400
A motherfucking year.

27:37.500 --> 27:39.500
You want to go
back to that?

27:43.100 --> 27:45.800
Yes, I wanna go back
to that!

27:45.835 --> 27:47.800
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

27:47.900 --> 27:50.100
- How was Mudvayne?
- They rocked.

27:50.200 --> 27:52.800
Look, I... I don't think I'll be able
to make it up there.

27:52.900 --> 27:56.265
What are you talking about?
You know mom's gonna call here.

27:56.300 --> 27:59.300
I'm a total dick if I leave here.
Just tell mom I'm on my way up.

27:59.335 --> 28:01.265
She's just
gonna call back.

28:01.300 --> 28:03.400
Come on, when do I ever
ask you for anything?

28:03.435 --> 28:05.565
All right,
you better stay there.

28:05.600 --> 28:08.400
Be home on time tomorrow.
I don't want any shit from mom.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.500
Frida, why do you and Diego
have separate houses?

28:13.600 --> 28:15.500
Because we are
two different people,

28:15.535 --> 28:17.000
but our love
makes us into one.

28:47.300 --> 28:49.300
- Hello?
- Mead, hi.

28:49.400 --> 28:52.000
Is your brother there?
He's not answering his cell.

28:52.035 --> 28:54.965
- I know, he's asleep.
- What?

28:55.000 --> 28:58.500
I probably shouldn't be telling you
this, but he was pretty zapped.

28:58.600 --> 29:00.500
I knew it.
Is he all right?

29:00.600 --> 29:02.265
Mom, he's fine.

29:02.300 --> 29:04.000
Just wait until you
have children.

29:04.100 --> 29:06.500
Not me,
I'm never having kids.

29:08.200 --> 29:10.865
So, how are
things going?

29:10.900 --> 29:12.900
We're in the middle
of a movie, Mom.

29:12.935 --> 29:15.600
Oh, I'm sorry.
Good night.

29:15.700 --> 29:17.600
Good night.

29:27.400 --> 29:29.965
Come on, light
the fucker up.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.500
- Give me the lighter.
- It's on the table.

29:35.800 --> 29:38.265
All right,
go, go, go, go, go!

29:38.300 --> 29:43.200
Go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go!

29:43.300 --> 29:45.400
Go! Hold it!
Hold it!

29:49.400 --> 29:51.665
Open up, it's me.

29:51.700 --> 29:54.300
Come on, open
the fucking door!

29:56.300 --> 29:58.400
Where's the patient?

30:08.900 --> 30:12.700
I got a new easel, new oils,
I'm ready to go.

30:12.800 --> 30:15.200
Salut.

30:22.600 --> 30:25.265
Oh, the wedding? Wh... what, do you
got everybody outside?

30:25.300 --> 30:28.500
- Ushers and everybody? Bring 'em in...
- It's a fucking disaster.

30:28.535 --> 30:29.800
- What?
- Somebody hit us.

30:29.900 --> 30:31.965
They stole all
the fucking cars.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.600
I had to sedate my own
little girl at her wedding.

30:34.635 --> 30:36.300
Jesus.

30:36.400 --> 30:40.000
Yeah, they had one of those... what do
you call it, those car carrier things?

30:40.035 --> 30:42.165
And it was a very well
coordinated operation.

30:42.200 --> 30:44.900
The cops are on it, but how much faith
have I got in that?

30:44.935 --> 30:47.567
You gotta help me
before they're chopped!

30:47.602 --> 30:50.165
I'm not really
in that business, Ira.

30:50.200 --> 30:53.465
Asa's brother's Benz was taken.
This special thing.

30:53.500 --> 30:57.300
I'm fucking gernischt in Asa's eyes now.
Can't you do anything?

30:57.400 --> 30:59.800
- I mean, make some calls?
- All that shit's insured.

30:59.900 --> 31:03.065
He's obsessed with that car,
this fucking Stew guy.

31:03.100 --> 31:06.500
The asshole paid a $30,000
premium just to place the fucking order.

31:06.535 --> 31:08.900
His glasses,
his daybook were in it.

31:26.100 --> 31:28.300
AJ, it's your mother.
Call me.

31:37.800 --> 31:41.100
It's my mother.

31:41.200 --> 31:44.700
I told you I can't put you through.
Room 417 has a block on the line.

31:44.800 --> 31:47.300
I am not waiting.
Who knows what's going on?

31:47.400 --> 31:50.200
God help you if anything happens
like those children in Westchester.

32:00.700 --> 32:04.150
Don't!
No, don't answer it.

32:04.185 --> 32:07.600
My face is stuck
to the rug.

32:10.600 --> 32:12.700
Oh, they fuckin'
crazy-glued you.

32:12.735 --> 32:14.865
Housekeeping!

32:14.900 --> 32:17.800
Oh, fuck, what should we do?
We're asleep!

32:17.835 --> 32:21.100
All right, help me.

32:21.135 --> 32:23.200
Ow, ow!

32:24.800 --> 32:27.700
- Ow! Dude, take it easy.
- I'm trying.

32:29.100 --> 32:32.050
Ahh ow, fuck.

32:32.085 --> 32:35.000
Oh, dude!

32:37.600 --> 32:40.300
Oh, fuck.

32:42.600 --> 32:44.400
Oh, fuck me.

32:55.100 --> 32:56.365
Hello.

32:56.400 --> 32:58.500
Hi, yeah, it's me.

32:58.600 --> 33:02.000
AJ stayed in the city with his friends
last night and he's not home yet.

33:02.035 --> 33:05.200
- And I can't get in touch with him.
- Take it easy. Slow down.

33:05.235 --> 33:07.165
He's probably just
sleeping it off.

33:07.200 --> 33:09.300
No, I called Todd's mother
and Todd came home.

33:09.400 --> 33:12.300
He could be dead by now,
O.D.'d, God knows what else.

33:12.335 --> 33:14.565
- God, why did I let him go?
- He's all right.

33:14.600 --> 33:18.000
I'll take care of it.
Give me the number of the hotel.

33:18.035 --> 33:20.165
It's the Hudson Suites
on the Westside.

33:20.200 --> 33:23.700
Tony, just go there. I am... I'm so
worried I'm not even angry anymore.

33:23.735 --> 33:26.200
All right, all right,
I'm on my way.

33:29.100 --> 33:31.565
Anthony?

33:31.600 --> 33:34.700
God damn you! I have been going
crazy trying to reach you.

33:34.800 --> 33:37.500
- Later. I don't feel good.
- What happened to your face?

33:37.535 --> 33:40.217
- Just leave me alone.
- I want to know what happened!

33:40.252 --> 33:42.900
You never went to Meadow's
after you gave me your word!

33:42.935 --> 33:44.600
- Get off my back.
- You are a liar!

33:44.700 --> 33:47.500
- Fuck you.
- What did you say?!

33:47.535 --> 33:49.600
Get back here!
Ow!

34:01.400 --> 34:03.365
Puritan Salvage.

34:03.400 --> 34:07.000
The big guy's looking for a consignment
from a wedding in Ringwood last night.

34:07.100 --> 34:08.864
Nothing came in here.

34:08.900 --> 34:11.400
This Benz, SL55,
he wants it pulled.

34:11.435 --> 34:13.000
I'll make some calls.

34:23.100 --> 34:25.400
- Where is he?
- In his room.

34:26.800 --> 34:28.800
What happened
to your leg?

34:28.900 --> 34:31.465
He lied to me, Tony,
which means that they both lied.

34:31.500 --> 34:34.800
She's covering for him.
It's what sisters are supposed to do.

34:34.900 --> 34:37.300
Of course, right.

34:37.400 --> 34:41.400
- He cursed at me. Oh my God.
- What did he say?

34:43.600 --> 34:46.900
- He's asleep.
- Not anymore.

34:46.935 --> 34:49.400
Oh, hey, Dad.

34:49.500 --> 34:52.600
I was just taking out the trash.
It's garbage day tomorrow.

34:54.400 --> 34:57.400
- What's different about you?
- He has no eyebrows, Tony!

34:59.000 --> 35:01.600
- Who did this?
- We were just screwing around.

35:01.635 --> 35:03.500
- What'd you say to your mother?
- Tony...

35:03.535 --> 35:05.400
What did you say?

35:05.500 --> 35:07.065
I said the "F" word.

35:07.100 --> 35:09.400
You're finished.
You're never gonna drive that car

35:09.435 --> 35:11.665
till you're 45 years old.
I'm selling it tomorrow!

35:11.700 --> 35:14.600
She wouldn't let me talk,
I was trying to tell her what happened.

35:14.635 --> 35:17.400
- Oh see, it's my fault.
- All right, let's hear it.

35:19.500 --> 35:22.765
Well, I was gonna go to Meadow's
but there weren't any cabs.

35:22.800 --> 35:26.100
I didn't think you'd want me standing
in the street at 11:30 at night.

35:26.200 --> 35:28.900
- We were right by the hotel.
- Enough of your lying.

35:28.935 --> 35:31.765
- I am not lying!
- Look at your face!

35:31.800 --> 35:34.600
If you've got some kind
of sexual proclivity

35:34.700 --> 35:37.400
with that teacher or whatever,
now is the time to tell us!

35:37.500 --> 35:40.600
What went on up there?
Poppers and weird sex?

35:40.635 --> 35:42.465
What? No!

35:42.500 --> 35:46.300
Look, we don't do drugs,
we're not some stupid dopers.

35:46.335 --> 35:49.265
I had a few beers,
but it just made me sick.

35:49.300 --> 35:51.900
- How can anybody believe what you say?
- Because I told you!

35:52.000 --> 35:54.800
You never believe me.

35:59.200 --> 36:02.400
- You had a couple beers?
- Yeah.

36:03.500 --> 36:05.500
- You didn't do any drugs.
- No!

36:07.800 --> 36:10.300
Carmela, look it...

36:10.400 --> 36:12.500
a couple of beers.

36:12.600 --> 36:15.300
Should be grounded, yeah,
but it's not the end of the world.

36:15.335 --> 36:17.700
What?

36:17.800 --> 36:19.965
You know what?

36:20.000 --> 36:23.665
I am sick of your bullshit.
Both of you!

36:23.700 --> 36:27.000
- He can go live with you.
- Don't get dramatic now, all right?

36:27.035 --> 36:28.800
- What? Great, good.
- Shut up!

36:28.900 --> 36:31.100
I have never been
more serious in my life.

36:33.900 --> 36:36.400
Take out the trash,
go outside.

36:39.900 --> 36:42.400
What are we gonna do,
really?

36:42.500 --> 36:44.565
What did I just say?

36:44.600 --> 36:48.200
- No, I mean really, come on.
- Did you think I was joking?

36:48.300 --> 36:50.800
Carmela, this is
normal teenage shit.

36:50.835 --> 36:53.265
You remember us?
The C.Y.O. Dance.

36:53.300 --> 36:56.100
We left Artie out in the snow,
he almost lost his fingers.

36:56.200 --> 36:58.200
And we still laugh
our asses off about it.

36:58.300 --> 37:01.900
No, I don't really blame AJ He's doing
exactly what he's supposed to.

37:02.000 --> 37:05.100
He's testing the limits as much
as he can. I blame myself.

37:05.200 --> 37:06.700
What are you
talking about?

37:06.800 --> 37:09.600
You don't know what it's like to have
your son hate your guts.

37:09.635 --> 37:13.100
- He doesn't hate your guts.
- Oh, thank God he's alive.

37:13.135 --> 37:14.665
It's my fault, Tony.

37:14.700 --> 37:18.465
My pathetic need to compete with you
clouded my judgment

37:18.500 --> 37:22.200
or I never would have let him stay
in New York. I knew he wasn't ready.

37:22.300 --> 37:24.100
I went against
all of my instincts.

37:24.200 --> 37:27.165
His eyebrows'll grow back!
Nothing really happened!

37:27.200 --> 37:31.200
No, you know what happened?
I said fuck it. And you know why?

37:31.235 --> 37:33.900
To get him to love me
as much as he loves you.

37:33.935 --> 37:35.765
He loves you,
it's just...

37:35.800 --> 37:37.550
you're his mother,
it's different.

37:37.585 --> 37:39.442
I can't be
the villain anymore.

37:39.477 --> 37:41.300
I mean it.
And I can't say fuck it.

37:41.400 --> 37:43.700
Take him. Let him
live with you.

37:45.900 --> 37:48.000
Homina-homina-
homina-homina.

37:49.900 --> 37:52.665
- Ed Norton?
- Ed Norton?

37:52.700 --> 37:54.900
No, I'm terribly
sorry, Mr. Kramden.

37:55.000 --> 37:58.200
No, the correct answer
is Stephen Foster. But thanks so much.

37:58.300 --> 38:01.000
You've been a wonderful contestant
and a swell sport.

38:01.035 --> 38:03.100
Goodbye,
Mr. Kramden.

38:03.200 --> 38:05.800
He's here.

38:09.200 --> 38:12.200
Hey, tarall's,
expiration date 2007.

38:12.300 --> 38:13.900
Put 'em over there.

38:19.300 --> 38:21.500
Have a seat.

38:22.500 --> 38:24.700
Uh-oh.

38:24.800 --> 38:27.265
Sounds serious.

38:27.300 --> 38:30.500
You have anything to do with
that wedding takedown in Ringwood?

38:30.535 --> 38:32.465
Why, is that a problem?

38:32.500 --> 38:34.800
I told you that doctor
was a friend of mine.

38:34.900 --> 38:37.300
I deliberately
used that word.

38:37.400 --> 38:40.400
Are you aware of how many things
a fucking M.D. can do for us?

38:40.500 --> 38:44.400
Sorry, Godfather, he was at the game.
I thought he was just another pigeon.

38:44.500 --> 38:46.000
Who authorized
you to do it?

38:46.100 --> 38:48.900
And don't call me Godfather
with that fucking cute smirk.

38:51.300 --> 38:53.800
I know I was away
for a long time,

38:53.900 --> 38:57.600
but when did that happen, you gotta ask
permission to ply your trade?

38:57.635 --> 39:00.965
Here's your end, be happy.

39:01.000 --> 39:04.300
When were you gonna tell me
about it if I hadn't called you here?

39:04.400 --> 39:06.900
I'm here now!
I'm telling you about it now!

39:07.000 --> 39:09.665
That's the second time
I'm playing catch-up with you.

39:09.700 --> 39:12.650
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- The lawn cutting.

39:12.685 --> 39:15.600
Do I have to send you a memo
every time I move my bowels too?

39:17.100 --> 39:18.900
You're so concerned
about my end,

39:19.000 --> 39:21.500
why didn't you put one of those cars
through my shops?

39:21.535 --> 39:23.500
What?

39:23.600 --> 39:25.900
Johnny Sack told me
about this guy in Newburgh.

39:25.935 --> 39:28.265
- Johnny Sack?
- Yeah, Johnny Sack.

39:28.300 --> 39:31.000
Anyway, he gave me a better deal
for shipping them whole.

39:31.100 --> 39:32.900
Are you fucking serious?

39:33.000 --> 39:34.765
I don't like the way
I'm being talked to here.

39:34.800 --> 39:38.200
What did I tell you when you came to me,
said you wanted back in?

39:38.235 --> 39:41.600
I said as long as you don't
step on anybody's toes.

39:41.700 --> 39:43.500
- In my day...
- That's another thing.

39:43.600 --> 39:45.600
I don't wanna hear no more
about how it was in your day.

39:45.635 --> 39:47.700
You just keep your anecdotes
to local color,

39:47.800 --> 39:50.200
like Dynaflows, or McGuire Sisters,
shit like that.

39:50.300 --> 39:53.000
Otherwise,
shut the fuck up!

39:58.700 --> 40:01.600
Jesus Christ, Feech,
I'm tryin' to ease your transition here

40:01.700 --> 40:03.800
and this is
the thanks I get?

40:11.300 --> 40:13.200
I'm sorry
if I offended you.

40:15.800 --> 40:18.900
You gotta remember, Tony,
I still think of you as a kid.

40:22.300 --> 40:24.200
I'll learn.

40:26.600 --> 40:29.000
Yeah?

40:29.100 --> 40:31.300
Yeah.

40:48.700 --> 40:51.700
That's funny.

41:03.800 --> 41:05.700
Come here.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.700
Aw, shit.
We all right?

41:14.800 --> 41:16.965
Just...

41:17.000 --> 41:20.000
get the SL55
back, okay?

41:31.300 --> 41:33.665
Maybe I was
too hard on that guy.

41:33.700 --> 41:36.000
Did I learn nothing
from Richie Aprile?

41:36.035 --> 41:38.300
Huh?

41:38.400 --> 41:41.900
- Nip it in the bud.
- Feech?

41:45.400 --> 41:48.300
- He's well liked, T.
- That's another thing.

41:52.400 --> 41:55.900
All right, well, don't be so hard
on yourself though.

42:18.300 --> 42:21.465
- Hey, Olsen and Johnson.
- How you doing?

42:21.500 --> 42:24.000
Stopped by the bakery,
they said you left already.

42:24.035 --> 42:26.665
That's the Canali suit
I promised you.

42:26.700 --> 42:30.400
He said you should try on the jacket,
see how the sleeves are.

42:31.800 --> 42:33.065
How's that?

42:33.100 --> 42:35.500
How's that?
I look better than Sinatra.

42:35.535 --> 42:38.065
- Very nice.
- All right.

42:38.100 --> 42:42.600
Hey, I'm having my wine and peaches.
You want?

42:42.700 --> 42:44.500
No thanks,
we gotta get going.

42:44.535 --> 42:46.265
- I'll try some peaches.
- Good.

42:46.300 --> 42:49.800
Peaches are from fucking New Zealand.
They're great. I'll get you a glass.

42:49.900 --> 42:51.400
No, we should go,
we should go...

42:51.500 --> 42:53.450
- take care of that thing.
- It can't wait?

42:53.485 --> 42:55.400
Where the fuck you going?
Come on, sit down.

42:55.500 --> 42:58.600
No, we gotta do this shit. You don't
wanna know, it's all fucked up.

42:58.700 --> 43:00.600
What?

43:00.700 --> 43:04.900
My imbecile cousin, he was welding
his boat trailer, burns down his garage.

43:04.935 --> 43:07.600
Now we got no place
to park the truck that we got.

43:07.635 --> 43:09.700
What's wrong
with the street?

43:09.800 --> 43:12.900
Georgia peaches,
those are considered the best.

43:13.000 --> 43:17.500
See, he don't want me
to know what's in the truck.

43:19.700 --> 43:23.165
Flat screen TVs.
50-inch plasma Philipses.

43:23.200 --> 43:26.400
Guy's coming down from Montreal,
but he got delayed a couple of days.

43:26.435 --> 43:28.300
I got a garage
right here.

43:28.400 --> 43:31.065
My cousin's mother's got a place,
we can lock it up there.

43:31.100 --> 43:35.100
Park the load here, this way I'm around.
Keep my glims on the stuff.

43:35.135 --> 43:38.200
- How much you gonna want for that?
- Two.

43:38.300 --> 43:41.500
Fuck you, Feech.
It's fucking parking.

43:41.535 --> 43:43.300
You gotta kick in a TV.

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
I thought I had a plan
for Anthony, but I...

43:52.100 --> 43:53.565
I'm not so sure now.

43:53.600 --> 43:56.000
I don't know if Rutgers'
summer program

43:56.035 --> 43:58.965
accepts boys
without eyebrows.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.465
So you heard about that?
I was a wreck.

44:01.500 --> 44:05.000
I mean look what happened
to those girls just driving to school.

44:05.035 --> 44:07.317
We brought in
grief counselors.

44:07.352 --> 44:09.565
How's Anthony
coping with that?

44:09.600 --> 44:11.700
I have to say
he never mentioned it.

44:14.900 --> 44:17.000
They all handle
tragedy differently.

44:19.900 --> 44:22.000
Actually, he just moved
in with his father.

44:22.100 --> 44:23.500
- I don't know if he said.
- Really?

44:23.600 --> 44:26.100
I don't know what you might
have heard about my husband.

44:26.135 --> 44:28.165
Some.

44:28.200 --> 44:30.400
I mean, he's a good father,
don't get me wrong.

44:30.435 --> 44:32.200
Our daughter
is at Columbia.

44:32.300 --> 44:34.900
My friends tell me I'm a snob
with this college business,

44:34.935 --> 44:37.100
but with Anthony
it's something else.

44:39.700 --> 44:43.400
I just know that if he didn't get into
a good enough school to interest him,

44:43.435 --> 44:46.200
and he dropped out,
went to work as a waiter or something,

44:46.235 --> 44:47.965
he wouldn't last
a week.

44:48.000 --> 44:51.300
You know, he would be drawn
right in... you know.

44:53.000 --> 44:56.350
My husband doesn't
want that for him either.

44:56.385 --> 44:59.700
You met him.
My husband can be very magnetic,

44:59.735 --> 45:02.165
you know,
bigger than life.

45:02.200 --> 45:05.800
And I was so young.
It was very exciting.

45:08.800 --> 45:11.165
Anyway, he's over there.

45:11.200 --> 45:12.900
Maybe it'll be good,
you know,

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
learning the things
that men need to know.

45:15.035 --> 45:17.100
Well...

45:17.200 --> 45:20.500
Anyway, so what about you?
How long have you been at the school?

45:20.535 --> 45:22.600
Since '86.

45:24.800 --> 45:28.200
I suppose that's what caught
me up too, with Astrid.

45:28.300 --> 45:31.600
Some notion of escaping
the quotidian.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.800
- So you were married.
- For about, uh... five minutes.

45:36.835 --> 45:38.800
Chicken Marsala.

45:41.500 --> 45:44.800
- And the honey balsamic chicken.
- Thank you.

45:44.900 --> 45:48.000
- Have you read "Madame Bovary"?
- No.

45:48.035 --> 45:50.465
It's almost
a perfect novel.

45:50.500 --> 45:54.100
Flaubert writes about bourgeois
loneliness and emptiness.

45:54.135 --> 45:57.700
Emma Bovary destroys herself
for some fantasy in her head.

45:57.735 --> 46:00.200
It's great.
It's truly, truly great.

46:00.300 --> 46:03.600
Somehow horrifically funny,
though tragic.

46:03.700 --> 46:05.400
I think you might
enjoy it.

46:08.300 --> 46:11.765
I'll stop by Borders
on my way home.

46:11.800 --> 46:14.500
- Who is it by again?
- Gustave Flaubert.

46:26.400 --> 46:28.165
Yeah?

46:28.200 --> 46:31.300
Supervisor Curran,
parole board.

46:31.400 --> 46:33.000
Site visit.

46:33.100 --> 46:35.400
Where's
Eddie Stimich?

46:35.500 --> 46:39.000
He's out sick.
I just wanna take a look around.

46:48.600 --> 46:51.400
Only thing better about here
than Russia is the food.

46:52.400 --> 46:54.100
Good one.

46:54.200 --> 46:57.800
Eddie examined every fucking
dust bunny in the place just last week.

46:57.835 --> 47:00.300
Is that new?

47:00.335 --> 47:02.217
Uh...

47:02.252 --> 47:04.100
bequest.

47:04.200 --> 47:06.300
Friend of mine,
passed away.

47:15.200 --> 47:17.000
Is that your garage?

47:17.100 --> 47:20.200
Nah, it's where I make the weapons
of mass destruction.

47:25.100 --> 47:27.100
Let's go out
and open it up.

47:27.135 --> 47:28.967
You wanna see
my fucking garage?

47:29.002 --> 47:30.800
You never seen
an oil stain before?

47:30.900 --> 47:33.900
Let's go.

47:45.600 --> 47:48.400
Here's the windup.

47:48.500 --> 47:50.200
And the pitch...

47:50.235 --> 47:51.900
- Ah!
- Come on!

47:52.000 --> 47:53.465
Fuck Major League
Baseball.

47:53.500 --> 47:56.300
Ever since the fucking strike.
Let's watch ballet.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.065
Oh, somebody
hotboxed us?

48:00.100 --> 48:02.700
- I saw you close the window.
- What's that?

48:02.800 --> 48:05.200
It's when you close
the windows and fart on purpose.

48:05.300 --> 48:06.800
That's a Dutch oven.

48:06.900 --> 48:09.600
- No, in bed it's a Dutch oven.
- What's a Dutch oven?

48:09.700 --> 48:12.600
You fart in bed with a woman then force
her head under the covers.

48:12.635 --> 48:14.365
That's awesome.

48:14.400 --> 48:17.900
- First you gotta be in bed with one.
- You'd be surprised.

48:17.935 --> 48:19.717
- Whoa.
- Ooh.

48:19.752 --> 48:21.500
Yeah, I would.

48:21.600 --> 48:25.100
Oh my God!
What...

48:25.135 --> 48:27.100
Jesus!

48:29.400 --> 48:32.100
That's enough.
Go upstairs, do your Spanish homework.

48:32.135 --> 48:35.000
- In 15 minutes.
- No, now.

48:47.500 --> 48:50.500
And he goes down looking.
The end of the inning.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.265
Just got the call.

49:32.300 --> 49:34.800
They put him on
a corrections bus this morning.

49:41.800 --> 49:44.165
This was the better move
than taking him out.

49:44.200 --> 49:47.800
- The man was a legend.
- Christopher agrees, by the way.

49:47.835 --> 49:51.000
Well, that's nice
that he agrees.

49:51.100 --> 49:54.200
But I'm not running
a fucking popularity contest.

50:26.300 --> 50:29.400
Mommy!
Look at me!

50:33.700 --> 50:35.900
Anthony!
