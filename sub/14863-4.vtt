<i>Previously on "Mistresses"...</i>

00:04.782 --> 00:07.950
You only chose me because
you thought I might die.

00:07.984 --> 00:10.118
I made some mistakes. So did you.

00:10.153 --> 00:11.954
- Are we done here?
- Yeah.

00:13.089 --> 00:14.857
I like you, Dom.

00:15.992 --> 00:18.226
Who is Daniel, and why's he texting...

00:18.261 --> 00:19.461
None of your business.
Play with your new phone.

00:21.597 --> 00:23.398
When was the last time
you were even on a date?

00:23.432 --> 00:25.667
Oh, I'll make you an online
profile like I did for April.

00:25.701 --> 00:26.801
It'll be fun.

00:26.836 --> 00:28.370
I'm sorry. Did I miss the open house?

00:28.404 --> 00:30.305
Are you the owner? I'm Zack.

00:30.340 --> 00:31.506
Savannah.

00:33.943 --> 00:36.077
Hi. Can I help you?

00:36.111 --> 00:37.412
Yeah, it's Zack.

00:37.446 --> 00:41.148
We met the other day. I
came for... the open house.

00:41.183 --> 00:43.485
Oh, yeah. Uh, hi.

00:43.519 --> 00:45.319
The house isn't on the market anymore.

00:45.354 --> 00:47.355
I actually accepted an offer.

00:47.390 --> 00:48.423
That's okay.

00:48.457 --> 00:51.092
I wasn't really interested in the house.

00:51.126 --> 00:54.395
I just wanted to meet you, Savannah.

00:54.429 --> 00:55.562
We need to talk.

00:55.597 --> 00:58.399
I-I'm sorry. What what is this?

00:58.433 --> 01:00.902
I'm Zack Kilmer.

01:00.936 --> 01:02.236
From the accident.

01:04.406 --> 01:06.240
I was driving the other car.

Karen?

01:17.318 --> 01:19.286
Karen Kim?

01:19.320 --> 01:22.122
Sean?

01:22.156 --> 01:24.057
- It's nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

01:24.092 --> 01:25.926
Uh, if I may say so, wow.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.361
You're even prettier in person
than your profile picture.

01:29.397 --> 01:31.631
Believe me, that never happens.

01:31.665 --> 01:33.466
Yours was pretty accurate, too.

01:33.500 --> 01:35.235
I'll take that as a compliment?

01:35.269 --> 01:37.570
It's actually my first time doing this.

01:37.604 --> 01:39.439
I'm still learning the ropes.

01:39.473 --> 01:41.607
I'm kind of a pro, unfortunately.

01:41.642 --> 01:44.043
Any tips?

01:44.077 --> 01:46.712
Uh, Google. Always Google.

01:46.747 --> 01:48.113
Did you... Google me?

01:48.148 --> 01:50.382
With most women, you don't
find much. But with you...

01:50.417 --> 01:53.252
Well, you know, since
you've been in the news...

01:53.286 --> 01:55.087
Can I ask you one thing?

01:55.121 --> 01:57.557
Did your life flash before your eyes?

01:57.591 --> 02:00.559
I mean, a gun pointed
at you, that's intense.

02:00.593 --> 02:02.461
It was.

02:02.495 --> 02:03.895
It was your boyfriend's crazy wife?

02:03.930 --> 02:05.331
You know, Sean...

02:05.365 --> 02:07.099
- You'd rather not?
- No.

02:07.133 --> 02:10.134
Right. Understood.

02:14.140 --> 02:16.307
Okay, just one more thing.

02:16.341 --> 02:18.344
So, when the police held you for hours...

02:18.345 --> 02:19.878
That must been pretty dramatic.

02:20.179 --> 02:21.713
Is this really necessary?

02:21.747 --> 02:23.882
You're so boring sometimes.

02:24.316 --> 02:26.316
Okay, open them.

02:26.953 --> 02:28.419
A box.

02:28.454 --> 02:29.588
- Whoo!
- Mm.

02:29.622 --> 02:31.389
Dude, you're really
killing my vibe. Come on.

02:33.859 --> 02:36.327
New business cards! What?!

02:36.362 --> 02:37.495
Wow.

02:37.529 --> 02:39.263
Right?

02:39.298 --> 02:40.365
Where are the real ones?

02:40.399 --> 02:41.866
Harry!

02:41.900 --> 02:43.534
All right, look.

02:43.568 --> 02:45.203
Your food is great and all that jazz.

02:45.237 --> 02:48.372
But truly, this... this face,
that's what all the ladies want.

02:48.406 --> 02:50.173
And... half the gentlemen.

02:50.730 --> 02:52.811
And I ain't so bad myself.
So why not use what we got?

02:52.844 --> 02:54.778
- What did you do to my...
- Hello?!

02:54.813 --> 02:55.946
Janine, hey.

02:55.981 --> 02:58.115
- Oh. Hi.
- How are you, Love?

02:58.149 --> 03:00.618
Well, I'm hung over, but I'm fabulous.

03:02.253 --> 03:03.654
- Please, take a seat.
- Thank you.

03:03.688 --> 03:06.823
No, wearing white.
That's not going to work.

03:06.857 --> 03:09.059
But I do have something
that's gonna make both of you

03:09.093 --> 03:12.062
- very happy... Your check.
- Oh!

03:12.096 --> 03:13.230
Thank you.

03:13.264 --> 03:14.998
Oh, no. Thank you.

03:15.033 --> 03:17.699
My friends are still talking
about how great that party was.

03:17.734 --> 03:19.802
Oh, w-well, hey, if any of those friends

03:19.837 --> 03:22.238
want to give us a call, please,
word of mouth is huge for us.

03:22.672 --> 03:25.741
Oh! Oh, my gosh, these are adorable.

03:25.775 --> 03:27.075
Thank you! They're new.

03:27.109 --> 03:28.577
Yes. You know what?

03:28.611 --> 03:30.179
Why don't you give me
a bunch more of these,

03:30.213 --> 03:33.015
because I'm going to
a charity gala tomorrow

03:33.449 --> 03:36.752
and it's called "kick
Leukemia in the ball."

03:36.786 --> 03:39.087
How cute is that?

03:39.121 --> 03:41.089
And it's such a good cause.

03:41.124 --> 03:43.825
Hey. Oh, my gosh. Why
don't you two come, as well?

03:43.960 --> 03:45.927
It would be a fantastic
networking opportunity.

03:45.962 --> 03:48.397
Oh, are you sure? That's
so generous of you.

03:48.431 --> 03:49.632
My table's full,

03:49.666 --> 03:52.701
but there are smaller
ones available at $5,000.

03:52.736 --> 03:54.870
Tax deductible, of course.

03:54.904 --> 03:55.904
Of course.

03:55.938 --> 03:57.739
You just say the word, and I'll get you in.

03:57.774 --> 03:59.407
- Yeah, no, I don't think we...
- In.

03:59.441 --> 04:01.076
Yay!

04:01.110 --> 04:03.912
Fantastic! I'll see you tomorrow.

04:03.946 --> 04:05.580
I'll call and let them know. Mwah!

04:05.614 --> 04:07.415
Okay. Ta-ta.

04:07.449 --> 04:10.152
Ciao, ciao. Bye.

04:10.186 --> 04:11.952
Okay...

04:11.987 --> 04:12.953
Have you gone insane?

04:12.988 --> 04:14.289
I know it seems like a lot of money.

04:14.323 --> 04:17.158
Yeah, $5,000 is a lot of money, Joss.

04:17.192 --> 04:18.326
It's not that much money if we split it...

04:18.360 --> 04:20.261
- It's $2,500 each.
- Absolutely not.

04:20.296 --> 04:21.762
You heard what she said, it's
a huge networking opportunity.

04:21.797 --> 04:23.097
If we want to build this business,

04:23.131 --> 04:24.499
we have to take some risks.

04:24.533 --> 04:25.833
Eating puffer fish is a risk, Joss.

04:25.867 --> 04:27.401
This is stupid.

04:27.435 --> 04:29.170
Okay, fine, I'll cover
the whole thing myself.

04:29.204 --> 04:30.737
All of it. All you have to do is show up.

04:30.772 --> 04:32.907
- Can you handle that much?
- Joss.

04:32.941 --> 04:34.241
It's your entire share of this check

04:34.276 --> 04:35.409
which, let's be honest,

04:35.443 --> 04:37.577
is basically all the money you have.

04:37.612 --> 04:41.481
Okay, well... I guess I'm all-in.

04:43.185 --> 04:46.486
Well I... I hope for your sake it pays...

04:46.521 --> 04:49.155
It'll pay off.

04:58.733 --> 05:00.366
I missed you.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.702
Mm. I missed you, too.

05:02.736 --> 05:05.538
How much?

05:08.075 --> 05:11.377
That could be Lucy.

05:12.412 --> 05:15.481
Nope. Just my friend Joss.

05:16.783 --> 05:18.884
You know you can answer your
phone in front of me, right?

05:18.918 --> 05:21.220
I know.

05:21.254 --> 05:22.488
But this is our time,

05:22.522 --> 05:25.658
and I don't want to waste a minute of it.

05:25.692 --> 05:28.661
Lucy will be here soon, and
I'll have to kick you out

05:28.695 --> 05:33.165
of this cozy... little... cocoon.

05:33.199 --> 05:35.700
I like the cocoon.

05:35.735 --> 05:37.035
Mm, good.

05:37.070 --> 05:39.004
But we are always in it.

05:39.038 --> 05:41.806
Mm.

05:41.841 --> 05:45.643
I like spending time with
you, April, okay? A lot.

05:45.678 --> 05:48.146
- And... and I don't want to mess this up.
- Me either.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.147
But if there is one thing that I learned

05:50.182 --> 05:53.985
in my time as a dark and
brooding artist-type...

05:54.019 --> 05:57.321
If you spend all your
time inside the cocoon,

05:57.356 --> 06:00.825
there's no chance of building
anything outside the cocoon.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.660
Yeah, will you just stop saying "cocoon"?

06:02.695 --> 06:04.429
Come on. Listen to me.

06:04.463 --> 06:06.931
What I'm saying is I want to meet Joss.

06:06.965 --> 06:10.034
I want to meet all your
people. I am serious about you.

06:13.372 --> 06:14.838
You are?

06:14.873 --> 06:16.107
You're important to me,

06:16.141 --> 06:18.075
and I want to meet the people
who are important to you.

06:20.478 --> 06:22.613
I don't remember that much.

06:22.647 --> 06:25.115
Woke up in the hospital with
tubes and wires everywhere,

06:25.149 --> 06:26.517
everything hurting.

06:26.551 --> 06:30.020
Snapped my femur, blew
two vertebrae in my back.

06:30.054 --> 06:31.688
Got a metal rod in there now.

06:31.723 --> 06:34.525
Doctors say I'm lucky I'm not paralyzed.

06:34.559 --> 06:35.793
Glad you're okay.

06:35.827 --> 06:37.294
Well, if you can call it that.

06:37.328 --> 06:38.796
I used to work construction.

06:38.830 --> 06:42.198
Turns out you can't do that
with a metal rod in your spine.

06:42.233 --> 06:44.401
I was in the middle of a job, too.

06:44.435 --> 06:46.736
It's too bad I didn't get hurt
there, if it had to happen.

06:46.770 --> 06:48.571
At least I could have got workman's comp.

06:48.605 --> 06:50.573
Have you looked into disability?

06:50.607 --> 06:53.944
Yeah, I get it. All 300 bucks a week.

06:53.978 --> 06:56.913
There are some exercises
you can do for your back

06:56.947 --> 06:58.213
to strengthen it.

06:58.248 --> 07:00.550
Maybe if you talked to your
physical therapist, they cou...

07:00.584 --> 07:02.452
My insurance doesn't cover
any physical therapist,

07:02.486 --> 07:04.420
and I don't need any more
bills than I already have,

07:04.455 --> 07:05.588
that's for sure.

07:05.622 --> 07:07.256
Okay.

07:07.290 --> 07:12.928
My girlfriend, she was
helping me out for a while.

07:12.963 --> 07:14.596
I guess she just had enough.

07:14.630 --> 07:16.098
And here you are.

07:16.132 --> 07:18.934
Yeah, well, this whole time,

07:18.969 --> 07:21.603
all the papers I kept filling out,

07:21.637 --> 07:23.605
I kept seeing the same name on them...

07:23.639 --> 07:26.275
Savannah Davis.

07:26.309 --> 07:31.112
I mean, this thing changed
my whole life, you know?

07:31.146 --> 07:34.349
And I didn't even know
who Savannah Davis was.

07:34.383 --> 07:35.851
So you just wanted to meet me?

07:35.885 --> 07:37.519
I wanted to know what it was like for you.

07:37.553 --> 07:40.856
If it was the same as me.

07:40.890 --> 07:43.358
Looks like you're doing all right, though.

07:43.392 --> 07:44.860
No, no, no.

07:44.894 --> 07:49.364
Look, uh, it has not been easy.

07:49.398 --> 07:52.467
Six surgeries, six months in rehab.

07:52.501 --> 07:57.605
My family and friends
really came through for me.

07:57.639 --> 08:00.174
And I know it can be
the hardest thing to ask

08:00.209 --> 08:02.843
the people that are closest
to you for help, but...

08:04.880 --> 08:06.981
They can make all the
difference in the world.

08:07.015 --> 08:09.817
Sometimes they can't.

08:11.920 --> 08:14.555
So, do you want money from me?

08:14.589 --> 08:16.456
Is... is that what you think?

08:16.491 --> 08:18.325
I don't know, really, what to think.

08:18.359 --> 08:20.160
You came in here talking about bills

08:20.194 --> 08:21.694
and... and... and insurance.

08:21.729 --> 08:23.363
Trying to tell you that nobody gets

08:23.398 --> 08:25.865
what I'm going through, and you th...

08:25.900 --> 08:27.534
You think I'm hitting you up for money.

08:27.568 --> 08:28.701
Look, I'm sorry. I just...

08:28.736 --> 08:30.703
I-I don't know what you want from me. I...

08:30.738 --> 08:32.705
Nothing.

08:32.740 --> 08:35.374
I don't know why I came here. I don't...

08:35.409 --> 08:37.510
I don't know who I expected you to be.

08:37.544 --> 08:39.078
Look, I-I...

08:39.111 --> 08:41.014
I'll see myself out.

08:51.047 --> 08:55.548
Okay, okay. So, wait. Just...
It couldn't have been that bad.

08:55.583 --> 08:57.216
He said he was turned on by the fact

08:57.250 --> 08:59.719
that I could inspire murderous passion.

08:59.753 --> 09:01.387
What? Okay, fine.

09:01.421 --> 09:03.222
You got one weirdo. Big whoop.

09:03.256 --> 09:05.057
He knew what kind of gun Elizabeth used.

09:05.092 --> 09:06.926
He knew Sam broke through the door.

09:06.961 --> 09:09.095
He knew what I wore to the trial that day.

09:09.129 --> 09:10.262
Oh, the Donna Karan jacket?

09:10.297 --> 09:11.763
- Loved!
- Joss!

09:11.798 --> 09:13.765
The point is, I can't date.

09:13.800 --> 09:15.301
Of course you can.

09:15.335 --> 09:17.870
How? Have you googled me recently?

09:17.904 --> 09:19.605
What you find isn't pretty.

09:19.639 --> 09:22.241
What... What are you talking about?

09:22.275 --> 09:25.244
Oh. Okay. I get it, yeah.

09:25.278 --> 09:26.479
So, maybe you're just not

09:26.513 --> 09:28.780
the ideal candidate for Internet dating.

09:28.815 --> 09:30.448
You just do it the old-school way.

09:30.483 --> 09:32.718
Go out into the real
world and meet somebody.

09:32.752 --> 09:34.452
Yeah, you got to put yourself out there.

09:34.487 --> 09:35.554
It might be a little extra leg work,

09:35.588 --> 09:36.755
but, hey, at least you can charm the pants

09:36.789 --> 09:38.924
off of him before he finds
out who the greys are.

09:38.958 --> 09:40.926
Ooh, sorry.

09:40.960 --> 09:43.328
What are you saying? I should
go clubbing? Hang out in bars?

09:43.362 --> 09:45.963
I met Daniel at an art
show I didn't want to go to.

09:45.998 --> 09:47.265
Exactly. You can't expect

09:47.299 --> 09:48.533
a love life to fall into your lap, Karen.

09:48.567 --> 09:51.536
- You have to really want it.
- I do want it. I just...

09:51.570 --> 09:55.373
Wish it was 20 years ago when
your secrets were your secrets,

09:55.408 --> 09:59.044
and no one could get to them
unless you wanted them to.

09:59.078 --> 10:00.878
I just have to face it.

10:00.913 --> 10:03.380
Unless I want to bring
Elizabeth and Sam and Tom

10:03.415 --> 10:06.316
- on dates with me, I'm done.
- Oh.

10:06.351 --> 10:08.986
I'm just gonna throw myself into my work.

10:09.021 --> 10:10.320
Oh.

10:10.355 --> 10:11.822
Okay, change of subject.

10:11.857 --> 10:13.991
I know this is bad timing,

10:14.026 --> 10:17.594
but Daniel wants to meet my people.

10:17.628 --> 10:19.163
What people? Us people?

10:19.197 --> 10:20.497
Well, you're the best ones I got.

10:20.532 --> 10:22.299
So he's serious about you.

10:22.333 --> 10:23.767
So he says.

10:23.801 --> 10:25.602
Oh. That's so great, Honey.

10:25.636 --> 10:27.604
So, dinner tomorrow night?

10:27.638 --> 10:29.940
Oh, no, tomorrow night I have a work thing.

10:29.974 --> 10:33.877
Oh, I already told him tomorrow.

10:33.911 --> 10:37.013
I'm free for the foreseeable future.

10:37.048 --> 10:38.481
What about Savi?

10:38.515 --> 10:40.283
Well, I called her. She
hasn't called me back yet.

10:40.317 --> 10:42.285
- Is she doing okay?
- Yeah, she seems okay.

10:42.319 --> 10:44.688
But honestly she hasn't said
much to me about anything.

10:44.722 --> 10:46.790
- Me either.
- Me neither.

10:46.824 --> 10:49.859
She'd tell someone if something was wrong.

10:49.894 --> 10:52.861
Yeah.

11:01.438 --> 11:03.206
Hey. You busy?

11:03.240 --> 11:05.174
Uh... nope.

11:05.209 --> 11:08.410
Good. Um... where's the roomie?

11:08.444 --> 11:10.846
She's downtown taking
depositions, mercifully.

11:10.880 --> 11:13.682
Great. 'Cause, um... I-I
wanted to talk to you.

11:13.717 --> 11:16.685
Um...

11:16.720 --> 11:18.153
I think we should come out as a couple.

11:18.187 --> 11:19.655
Yeah, I-I've been thinking about it,

11:19.689 --> 11:21.690
you know, and I-it's
worse if we get caught.

11:21.725 --> 11:24.192
But you were so sure
we should keep it quiet.

11:24.227 --> 11:25.327
- Did something happen?
- Yeah.

11:25.361 --> 11:28.330
No. No. Well... well, yeah.

11:28.364 --> 11:29.998
You know, I mean, at at the very beginning,

11:30.032 --> 11:31.500
I thought it would be simpler, you know...

11:31.534 --> 11:33.768
You just coming back,
us finding our groove.

11:33.802 --> 11:36.338
I-I didn't want to put
any more stress on us.

11:36.372 --> 11:39.007
But, you know, I think we're past all that.

11:39.041 --> 11:41.408
Why not own it and just move on clean?

11:41.443 --> 11:43.745
Right. I mean, why not?

11:43.779 --> 11:45.747
Okay. All right.

11:45.781 --> 11:48.282
So, um... so we'll go to H.R. today?

11:48.316 --> 11:50.584
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

11:55.057 --> 11:58.359
Okay. In we go.

11:58.393 --> 12:00.594
I knew it would fit!

12:00.629 --> 12:02.095
I look like "The jerk."

12:02.130 --> 12:04.265
What? You don't look like a jerk.

12:04.299 --> 12:06.267
"The jerk." St... "The jerk."

12:06.301 --> 12:09.102
Steve Martin. The movie. "The jerk."

12:09.137 --> 12:11.104
I don't know what that is.

12:11.139 --> 12:12.105
Okay, what if...

12:12.140 --> 12:14.607
- Hello! Oh, my God.
- Kyra, I...

12:14.642 --> 12:15.776
No, just come in. That's good.

12:15.810 --> 12:18.145
It was open. You look like "The jerk."

12:18.179 --> 12:19.980
Yeah, funny. Yep.

12:20.014 --> 12:21.648
What are you... please tell
me you're not wearing that.

12:21.683 --> 12:23.283
Please tell me you have a tux.

12:23.317 --> 12:24.584
Yeah, I had a tux from my wedding,

12:24.618 --> 12:26.553
but I don't think we need
any bad luck tonight, do we?

12:26.587 --> 12:27.788
Okay, well, suit yourself.

12:27.822 --> 12:29.789
- Get it?
- Oh, I did get it. That was good.

12:30.760 --> 12:33.294
All right, um, so, for
tonight, at the moment,

12:33.327 --> 12:34.860
if you want to invite anyone, please do,

12:34.895 --> 12:36.663
because our table's
looking a little bit light.

12:36.697 --> 12:38.331
Why? What do you mean? How light?

12:38.365 --> 12:41.734
Um, like, at the moment,
it's you and it's me.

12:41.768 --> 12:43.736
- And me.
- And Kyra.

12:43.770 --> 12:45.570
What was the point of
booking a whole table, Joss?

12:45.605 --> 12:47.038
Okay, what about Karen and April?

12:47.072 --> 12:48.107
They can come, right, with dates?

12:48.141 --> 12:49.175
No, no, they're busy.

12:49.209 --> 12:50.509
Did you tell them that you spent $5,000?

12:50.543 --> 12:52.144
Surely they can move some things around.

12:52.179 --> 12:54.279
You know what, Harry, I don't think
that they would have fun, anyway.

12:54.314 --> 12:56.415
We're gonna be working
and running around and...

12:56.449 --> 12:58.350
Can I invite someone? You
can invite three someones.

12:58.384 --> 12:59.351
- Seriously?
- Mmhmm.

12:59.385 --> 13:01.187
I'll go make some calls.

13:01.221 --> 13:02.921
Someone's excited.

13:02.955 --> 13:04.823
Mm. All right, oh, okay.

13:04.857 --> 13:09.428
Karen and April, are they
not coming because of me?

13:09.462 --> 13:10.562
No, no.

13:10.597 --> 13:12.664
No. I mean, not exactly.
I-I didn't invite them.

13:13.633 --> 13:17.102
Harry, I-I can't invite
them and not invite Savi.

13:17.136 --> 13:19.104
And obviously, I can't
invite Savi, so it's just...

13:19.138 --> 13:20.939
You know, it's just easier this way.

13:20.973 --> 13:25.509
Right. Sorry about that.

13:25.544 --> 13:27.045
Hey, you can't expect to
win us all in this thing.

13:27.079 --> 13:28.613
Yeah, I know. I know. I know.

13:28.647 --> 13:29.948
- Yeah?
- Mm.

13:29.982 --> 13:30.982
Hey!

13:32.218 --> 13:34.452
You got me.

13:36.888 --> 13:38.689
Is there anywhere you'd like to start?

13:38.724 --> 13:40.691
Anything you want to talk about?

13:40.726 --> 13:42.293
Not really.

13:42.327 --> 13:45.129
How about the thoughts in your head

13:45.163 --> 13:46.631
before you went to sleep last night?

13:46.665 --> 13:48.065
Who says I slept?

13:48.099 --> 13:50.735
There was a rager on the roof of my condo,

13:50.769 --> 13:53.237
some persian engagement party or something.

13:53.271 --> 13:54.738
Lots of cousins.

13:54.773 --> 13:56.073
I'm relieved to hear that.

13:56.107 --> 13:58.142
That you weren't up
fixated about something.

13:58.176 --> 13:59.676
Those thoughts have stopped.

13:59.710 --> 14:00.878
Which thoughts are those?

14:00.912 --> 14:02.545
The bad ones.

14:02.580 --> 14:06.049
The... wanting to kill myself ones.

14:06.084 --> 14:08.385
Should we talk about
that? What led you there?

14:08.419 --> 14:09.886
Sorry, do I have to sit here?

14:09.920 --> 14:13.757
No. Make yourself at home.

14:13.791 --> 14:17.093
I know it must be painful to remember,

14:17.127 --> 14:19.095
but it's important.

14:19.129 --> 14:22.265
If we examine what
happened, we can try to avoid

14:22.300 --> 14:26.102
the same negative thought
patterns in the future.

14:26.136 --> 14:28.771
Do you remember what you
were thinking and feeling

14:28.806 --> 14:31.407
in those moments when you
wanted to hurt yourself?

14:31.441 --> 14:34.743
Um, I was upset, obviously.

14:34.778 --> 14:36.745
About something specific?

14:36.780 --> 14:38.714
I got in a fight with my parents.

14:38.748 --> 14:40.582
A really bad fight.

14:40.617 --> 14:42.951
My dad said they didn't
want to talk to me anymore.

14:42.985 --> 14:44.252
That's pretty extreme.

14:44.287 --> 14:47.088
Yeah. I thought so, too.

14:47.123 --> 14:50.091
What did you fight about?

14:50.126 --> 14:53.962
How I had shamed the family
with my career choice.

14:53.996 --> 14:56.298
What do you do?

15:02.671 --> 15:05.340
I'm an escort.

15:06.742 --> 15:09.777
Look, it's not like I dreamt
it up on career day or anything.

15:09.812 --> 15:12.780
But college is really expensive

15:12.815 --> 15:17.452
and... my parents couldn't help.

15:17.486 --> 15:19.454
Sleeping with rich guys

15:19.488 --> 15:22.423
was a fast way to make a lot of money.

15:22.458 --> 15:26.427
Lots of girls do it
now. You'd be surprised.

15:26.462 --> 15:31.966
Plus, it was kind of... interesting.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.168
How so?

15:34.202 --> 15:38.672
Well... you're out a lot.

15:38.706 --> 15:43.010
Dressed up, meeting new
guys, trying new things.

15:44.379 --> 15:47.014
I guess I'm kind of a free spirit that way.

15:47.048 --> 15:50.350
Even though people who
know me wouldn't say that.

15:50.385 --> 15:51.685
What would they say?

15:51.719 --> 15:54.187
That I'm a good girl.

15:54.221 --> 15:59.192
It wasn't really me, anyway,
who was meeting those men.

15:59.226 --> 16:02.362
I gave them a fake name, fake story,

16:02.397 --> 16:04.430
whatever turned them on.

16:04.464 --> 16:08.667
Would you say you did it
to feel like someone else?

16:08.702 --> 16:10.836
No, I did it to buy an education

16:10.871 --> 16:13.839
and a great condo in Beverly Hills.

16:13.874 --> 16:15.775
And as a plus, you know...

16:18.812 --> 16:21.414
I never spent a night alone.

16:39.062 --> 16:39.963
Come on.

16:40.097 --> 16:41.231
Okay, miss Davis.

16:41.265 --> 16:43.400
Uh, yes! Yes, yes. I'm here.

16:43.434 --> 16:46.736
Section "P", row "Q".

16:46.770 --> 16:49.873
Okay. And... and how much are these?

16:49.907 --> 16:51.374
Uh, each?

16:51.408 --> 16:53.709
$200 to see the Red Hot Chili Peppers

16:53.744 --> 16:56.379
from that far away are you kidding me?

16:56.413 --> 16:59.215
Uh, no. Uh, they're for a friend.

17:01.418 --> 17:04.219
Okay, you know what? Let's
just do it, all right?

17:04.253 --> 17:06.388
Uh, yeah, yeah. C-can
you hold on one sec...

17:06.423 --> 17:09.057
H... oh, j-just hold
on. Give me one second.

17:09.092 --> 17:11.560
Molly? Molly!

17:11.595 --> 17:16.699
Line on, give her my mastercard.
I'm late for my H.R. meeting.

17:16.733 --> 17:18.467
And that's my Willie as Abraham Lincoln.

17:18.502 --> 17:21.469
The resemblance is... uncanny.

17:21.503 --> 17:23.305
So cute. Aw.

17:23.339 --> 17:26.875
Oh, I'm so sorry I'm late.
Did I miss it? Are we out?

17:26.910 --> 17:29.811
Actually, uh, I haven't told
Wendy anything yet, so...

17:29.845 --> 17:31.914
Oh, okay. I'm so sorry.

17:31.948 --> 17:33.248
It's all right. It's all right.

17:33.283 --> 17:34.416
Hi.

17:34.450 --> 17:36.584
So, uh, as you may have guessed,

17:36.619 --> 17:37.919
Savannah and I asked you here

17:37.953 --> 17:40.087
because we are in a relationship,

17:40.122 --> 17:41.423
uh, a personal relationship.

17:41.457 --> 17:44.158
And obviously, we would
never let that affect work,

17:44.192 --> 17:46.394
but we just thought we should
handle it on the up-and-up.

17:46.429 --> 17:47.729
Oh! Sorry, sorry, sorry.

17:47.763 --> 17:50.231
Let me just turn the ringer down here.

17:50.265 --> 17:51.733
Okay.

17:51.767 --> 17:53.500
Well, I certainly
appreciate your initiative.

17:53.535 --> 17:55.836
You know, most people
wait till there's a problem

17:55.870 --> 17:57.738
to come to human resources.

17:57.772 --> 17:59.407
Exactly what we were hoping to avoid.

18:00.943 --> 18:02.076
Uh, the ticket place said
that your card is expired.

18:02.110 --> 18:03.411
Do you want me to use another one?

18:03.445 --> 18:05.947
This... this is kind of an
important meeting, Molly.

18:05.981 --> 18:07.348
Sorry.

18:07.382 --> 18:09.683
Tickets?

18:09.717 --> 18:12.519
Y-yeah, for, uh, Joss' birthday.

18:12.554 --> 18:13.787
Hmm.

18:13.822 --> 18:17.758
Anyhoo, let's just get to the
employee conduct guidelines...

18:32.306 --> 18:35.942
Okay, so, if this is table
8 and this is table 25,

18:35.977 --> 18:38.445
there's obviously no logic
to how this is all arranged.

18:38.479 --> 18:41.281
This is so hard!

18:41.315 --> 18:42.448
I'm under dressed.

18:42.483 --> 18:44.617
Oh, I-I told you you would be.

18:44.651 --> 18:45.818
You said you didn't care.

18:45.853 --> 18:47.653
Yeah, well, that was
before we bloody got here.

18:47.688 --> 18:49.689
Well, this is why you should listen to me

18:49.723 --> 18:51.190
about everything, Harry, all the time.

18:51.224 --> 18:53.659
Found it! Yay!

18:53.694 --> 18:54.994
Scott, you're here.

18:55.028 --> 18:56.662
How are you? Good to see you.

18:56.697 --> 18:59.664
Guys, this is my amazing friend Scott.

18:59.699 --> 19:01.133
He did my nose.

19:01.167 --> 19:01.902
Oh.

19:01.936 --> 19:05.070
I don't... I don't normally lead
with that, but, uh, I'm Scott.

19:05.105 --> 19:06.905
- I'm a plastic
surgeon. - H-hey.

19:06.939 --> 19:08.340
Amazing plastic surgeon.

19:08.375 --> 19:11.810
I used to have this huge bump right here,

19:11.844 --> 19:13.945
and now it's totally gone.

19:13.980 --> 19:15.647
He also does boobs.

19:15.681 --> 19:19.150
- Well...
- Okay, this is not going, um...

19:19.184 --> 19:20.552
Like I thought it would.

19:20.586 --> 19:22.053
Well, it's nice to meet you, Scott.

19:22.087 --> 19:24.222
Hey. My, uh, boobs are fine,
so I'm gonna find the bar.

19:24.256 --> 19:25.356
All right.

19:25.391 --> 19:26.858
I'll come.

19:26.893 --> 19:29.060
Full of energy, that one.
You want to have a seat?

19:29.094 --> 19:30.562
- Oh, no, I'm okay, thanks.
- You sure?

19:30.596 --> 19:31.896
- Yeah.
- All right. All right.

19:31.930 --> 19:34.532
Oh, the, uh...

19:34.566 --> 19:36.200
It's a pretzel roll.

19:36.235 --> 19:38.236
Uh... I'm... no, I'm good.

19:38.270 --> 19:39.470
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:39.505 --> 19:40.638
No, it's pretty much
the greatest pretzel roll

19:40.672 --> 19:41.739
I've ever had in my entire life.

19:41.773 --> 19:43.874
Okay.

19:43.909 --> 19:45.876
You're gonna love it.

19:45.911 --> 19:47.878
- Okay.
- You're not gonna eat it?

19:47.913 --> 19:49.279
What?

19:49.313 --> 19:50.948
Well, I mean, I just said this is
pretty much the greatest pretzel roll

19:50.982 --> 19:52.449
I've ever had in my entire life,

19:52.483 --> 19:54.251
you know, and then, I think,
you know, by offering it to you

19:54.285 --> 19:55.385
instead of taking it for myself

19:55.420 --> 19:58.055
is sort of a romantic gesture, you know?

19:58.991 --> 20:00.925
Of course, now I feel
vulnerable admitting that to you.

20:01.660 --> 20:03.627
Feel like if you don't eat it,
it would be a real gut punch.

20:03.662 --> 20:06.196
You do realize that there
are a lot more rolls?

20:06.230 --> 20:09.366
Yeah, no, I, um... I was just joking.

20:09.400 --> 20:10.900
I'm never vulnerable.

20:12.136 --> 20:13.403
Also a joke.

20:13.438 --> 20:14.804
Are you on something right now?

20:14.838 --> 20:19.142
I am, uh, rusty with the
small talk, is what's going on.

20:19.177 --> 20:20.743
I don't go on a lot of blind dates.

20:20.778 --> 20:24.447
- Oh...
- Yeah.

20:26.416 --> 20:28.384
Mm... hmm.

20:28.418 --> 20:30.053
Oh, you know what, um...

20:30.087 --> 20:31.888
I'm just gonna grab a
cocktail really quickly.

20:31.922 --> 20:33.056
Excuse me, sir. Sorry.

20:33.090 --> 20:34.924
- I'm just gonna take one.
- Okay.

20:42.599 --> 20:44.233
They're late.

20:44.267 --> 20:47.570
I'm sure they'll be here soon.

20:48.938 --> 20:50.072
Hi!

20:50.107 --> 20:52.141
- Hey.
- I am so sorry.

20:52.175 --> 20:54.977
And Dom will be here any minute.
He got stuck at a meeting.

20:55.011 --> 20:57.312
Where's Daniel? What happened?

20:57.346 --> 20:58.580
Are we not meeting Daniel?

20:58.615 --> 21:00.415
It's a whole thing.

21:01.618 --> 21:03.018
Daniel will be here in 10 minutes, okay?

21:03.052 --> 21:05.487
I called you here early so we
can go over some guidelines.

21:05.521 --> 21:06.068
Guidelines?

21:06.070 --> 21:08.257
Yes. And quickly, since
we're running out of time.

21:08.290 --> 21:09.524
Sorry.

21:09.558 --> 21:11.792
So, topics to avoid. Paul, for example.

21:11.827 --> 21:13.428
Oh, I'm glad you mentioned that,

21:13.462 --> 21:15.436
because I was actually
gonna lead with Paul.

21:15.438 --> 21:15.964
No, no, no.

21:15.998 --> 21:18.466
No stories about high school
Paul is in most of those...

21:18.501 --> 21:20.635
And no wedding stories, Karen.

21:20.669 --> 21:22.303
Why in the world would
I tell your wedding story

21:22.338 --> 21:23.438
to your new boyfriend?

21:23.472 --> 21:25.140
You told them to Richard!

21:25.174 --> 21:26.474
- I did?
- You did.

21:26.509 --> 21:28.475
Um, okay, wait... so, when we say no Paul,

21:28.510 --> 21:31.978
are we talking about, like, no
Paul of the last three years,

21:32.013 --> 21:33.780
or no Paul from, like, ever?

21:33.814 --> 21:35.081
No, no, no. Neither. None of it. No.

21:35.116 --> 21:36.483
Because no matter what
part of the story you tell,

21:36.518 --> 21:37.817
the story ends the same.

21:37.852 --> 21:41.555
And in that story, I'm
betrayed and duped and naive,

21:41.589 --> 21:42.789
and I don't want him to see me like that.

21:42.823 --> 21:45.292
I really like this guy.
I like who I am with him.

21:45.326 --> 21:48.795
I am cool and free and just in the now.

21:48.829 --> 21:53.800
I mean, you've never seen me so in the now.

21:55.335 --> 21:57.303
- Got it.
- No Paul.

21:57.337 --> 21:59.472
This is gonna be great.

21:59.506 --> 22:01.975
It'll be great.

22:02.009 --> 22:04.143
Have a lovely night.

22:04.178 --> 22:06.512
You got any jobs lined up for us yet?

22:06.547 --> 22:08.514
I'm working on it. You
could smile a little bit.

22:08.549 --> 22:10.183
Where's Scott? Who?

22:10.217 --> 22:11.850
Oh!

22:11.885 --> 22:13.553
The stranger who thinks
he's on a date with me.

22:13.587 --> 22:14.787
- How's it going?
- Yeah.

22:14.821 --> 22:16.422
Did you tell him that we
were on a date together?

22:16.456 --> 22:17.723
Yes.

22:17.757 --> 22:19.392
I just figured that you're a great person

22:19.426 --> 22:21.093
and he's a great person

22:21.127 --> 22:22.995
and two great people
should meet each other.

22:23.029 --> 22:24.897
You do understand that this
isn't how setups work, right?

22:24.931 --> 22:26.431
- What do you mean?
- Well, if you're gonna set people up,

22:26.465 --> 22:27.666
you don't just tell one of them.

22:27.701 --> 22:29.168
You tell neither of them or both of them.

22:29.202 --> 22:30.335
You don't just tell one.

22:30.369 --> 22:33.172
Oh. That does make more sense.

22:33.206 --> 22:34.673
Yeah. Did you know about this?

22:34.708 --> 22:36.008
Absolutely not.

22:36.042 --> 22:38.176
What do you think of him, though? Scott.

22:38.211 --> 22:39.477
Kyra, just... shh. I
think I'm here to work.

22:39.512 --> 22:40.612
I think I spent $5,000 on a table

22:40.646 --> 22:43.114
and I really need to get my money back,

22:43.148 --> 22:44.782
and I think I don't have time
to babysit your little friend.

22:44.817 --> 22:46.117
And even if I did, I don't want to date

22:46.151 --> 22:47.619
a fricking plastic surgeon, okay?

22:47.653 --> 22:48.886
- Three words.
- Hmm?

22:48.921 --> 22:50.522
Free Botox.

22:51.657 --> 22:53.457
Two words.

22:56.628 --> 22:58.229
It's so good to meet you guys.

22:58.263 --> 22:59.764
I've heard great things from April.

22:59.798 --> 23:01.099
Oh?

23:01.133 --> 23:03.134
Yeah, she's told me nothing.

23:03.168 --> 23:05.236
Uh, where are you from?

23:05.270 --> 23:11.908
Actually I grew up with
my family and my sister.

23:11.943 --> 23:14.911
That's Joss, you'll meet her.

23:14.946 --> 23:16.079
Okay. And how did you two meet?

23:16.114 --> 23:17.114
Oh, we...

23:17.148 --> 23:20.150
- At work.
- Uh... the office.

23:20.184 --> 23:22.486
Right on.

23:22.520 --> 23:26.656
Okay, uh... and Karen, how
do you fit into all this?

23:26.690 --> 23:31.661
Well, I met, um... April through S-Savi,

23:31.695 --> 23:35.065
and, um, Savi and I, we met in grad school.

23:35.099 --> 23:36.466
You're a lawyer?

23:36.500 --> 23:38.168
Psychiatrist.

23:38.202 --> 23:39.836
What an interesting job.

23:39.871 --> 23:42.005
I mean, you must see some
really deep stuff, right?

23:42.039 --> 23:43.072
Like, human frailty...

23:43.106 --> 23:46.709
Yep.

23:50.113 --> 23:53.283
I almost forgot.

23:53.317 --> 23:55.285
We have some news.

23:55.319 --> 23:56.352
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

23:56.387 --> 23:57.787
We came out to H.R. today.

23:57.821 --> 23:58.854
You did?!

23:58.889 --> 24:00.589
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

24:00.623 --> 24:02.091
Yeah, that's great.

24:02.125 --> 24:04.326
That is... oh, that is so romantic.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.929
I don't know how romantic it was

24:06.963 --> 24:09.098
sitting across from Wendy way... way...

24:09.132 --> 24:11.767
- Wegweiser. -
We-weg-we-wegweiser.

24:11.802 --> 24:13.235
- Wendy wegweiser.
- Wow.

24:13.270 --> 24:15.004
- Yeah.
- Yeah, and her pet ferret, Willie.

24:15.038 --> 24:17.506
- What? She has a pet ferret?
- She has a pet ferret, yes.

24:17.540 --> 24:20.175
And many, many photos.

24:45.500 --> 24:46.801
Will you excuse me?

24:46.836 --> 24:49.537
Wendy Wegweiser. Wait.
She dresses up her ferret?

24:49.571 --> 24:52.573
Are you serious?

24:52.607 --> 24:55.576
Karen, are you in here? Everything okay?

24:57.612 --> 24:59.313
I'm fine.

25:03.251 --> 25:07.054
Obviously something's wrong.

25:07.088 --> 25:08.555
This is it.

25:08.589 --> 25:10.090
What is?

25:10.124 --> 25:14.627
This is gonna be my whole life.

25:16.130 --> 25:17.931
I'll always be alone.

25:17.966 --> 25:20.200
Sweetie, that's not true.

25:20.235 --> 25:23.035
Now, you've just had some
bad luck, some bad dates.

25:23.070 --> 25:24.036
But it... it'll get better.

25:24.071 --> 25:27.407
It's not just about the dates.

25:31.078 --> 25:36.215
It's the way I feel in the world.

25:36.250 --> 25:39.551
Around people. All of the time.

25:41.255 --> 25:42.955
What do you mean?

25:42.990 --> 25:45.124
I'm lonely, Savi.

25:48.661 --> 25:52.965
Everything that happened to me, I can't...

25:53.000 --> 25:55.801
Move past it.

25:55.835 --> 25:58.737
But I can't share it.

25:58.772 --> 26:00.639
Why do you feel that way?

26:00.673 --> 26:02.307
Because no one understands.

26:04.310 --> 26:08.947
Oh... apologize to everyone for me?

26:08.981 --> 26:10.949
- Of course.
- I've got to get home.

26:10.983 --> 26:12.450
It's okay.

26:12.484 --> 26:13.785
Sorry.

26:13.819 --> 26:15.820
No, don't be sorry.

26:30.159 --> 26:33.294
I think that went well, you know?

26:33.328 --> 26:35.630
April seemed to have a good time.

26:35.664 --> 26:37.966
- Savi?
- Yeah.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.801
I like Daniel a lot.

26:39.835 --> 26:40.969
Mm-hmm.

26:41.003 --> 26:42.737
Well...

26:42.771 --> 26:45.039
Is everything okay with Karen?

26:45.074 --> 26:47.541
She's having a hard time right now.

26:47.576 --> 26:49.510
I think it's hard for her,

26:49.544 --> 26:51.345
after everything she
went through last year,

26:51.379 --> 26:54.181
to make small talk with strangers.

26:54.216 --> 26:55.917
Or anyone.

26:56.051 --> 26:59.353
- Even you guys?
- I think when you go through that trauma,

26:59.387 --> 27:00.855
you put distance between you

27:01.389 --> 27:04.190
and the people that you're closest to.

27:04.225 --> 27:07.594
It, uh, sort of puts things
in perspective, doesn't it?

27:07.629 --> 27:09.930
- What?
- Well, you've been through a lot, too.

27:09.964 --> 27:13.100
But you got past it.

27:13.134 --> 27:15.435
Look at you, you know? Look at us.

27:15.469 --> 27:19.305
We made it to the other side,
and we're in a good place.

27:19.340 --> 27:23.075
You know, I'm just, uh...
I'm... I'm just grateful.

27:23.110 --> 27:26.112
Me too.

27:26.147 --> 27:27.947
Um...

27:27.981 --> 27:29.815
Listen. I, uh...

27:29.850 --> 27:32.485
I have to tell you something.

27:32.520 --> 27:34.787
It's about Toni.

27:34.821 --> 27:36.222
- Uh-oh.
- No, no.

27:36.257 --> 27:37.723
No, it's not what you think. I mean...

27:37.758 --> 27:41.393
You were right.

27:41.427 --> 27:43.896
She told me she has feelings for me.

27:43.930 --> 27:45.330
When?

27:45.365 --> 27:47.600
Last week. And I-I should
have told you right then.

27:47.635 --> 27:49.502
But I-I know how much she
gets under your skin already,

27:50.037 --> 27:51.337
and I just didn't want
to rock the boat any more.

27:51.372 --> 27:53.672
- Rock the boat? - I-I
look, I-I was wrong.

27:54.106 --> 27:56.241
I'm sorry.

27:56.276 --> 27:58.109
This is why we went to H.R.

27:58.144 --> 27:59.678
Yeah.

27:59.712 --> 28:02.347
- I told you she was after you.
- Yeah, I know.

28:02.382 --> 28:05.184
Oh, why are men so blind about this stuff?

28:05.218 --> 28:06.685
Why are you so blind about this stuff?

28:06.719 --> 28:09.921
Look, I just want you to know
that I heard you the other day.

28:09.955 --> 28:11.589
I just...

28:11.623 --> 28:14.159
I just don't want there to
be any secrets between us.

28:14.193 --> 28:17.461
Let's get some sleep.

28:20.834 --> 28:21.934
I don't know if you saw that one.

28:21.968 --> 28:23.902
Oh, my God, I loved that one. That was you?

28:24.136 --> 28:26.104
You know, sometimes you
find the right script

28:26.138 --> 28:28.138
and you just have to make it happen.

28:28.173 --> 28:30.474
Mm. Well, I, for one, am very glad you did.

28:30.509 --> 28:32.976
Mm, me too.

28:35.347 --> 28:38.882
You know what? Will you
just give me one second?

28:38.917 --> 28:40.050
Uh, yeah, sure.

28:40.085 --> 28:41.319
Whoa, hey!

28:41.353 --> 28:42.820
Probably not the only one
here eating two, right?

28:43.522 --> 28:45.989
Come on, dude. You're
totally stressing me out.

28:46.024 --> 28:47.224
You're like a labradoodle over here.

28:47.258 --> 28:48.858
Well, I have been called
many things in my time,

28:48.892 --> 28:49.859
but never a labradoodle.

28:49.894 --> 28:51.395
You look like a lost puppy,
sitting here all by yourself.

28:51.429 --> 28:52.396
You're making me feel bad.

28:52.430 --> 28:54.231
Don't feel bad. I'm... I'm fine.

28:54.265 --> 28:55.365
You know, why wouldn't I be?

28:55.400 --> 28:56.566
I've got all the pretzel
rolls I can handle.

28:56.600 --> 28:57.935
'Cause you thought you
were going on a date,

28:57.969 --> 29:00.002
which isn't your fault,
but... now you're not.

29:00.037 --> 29:03.941
Yeah, no, that's true.
Th-that part happened, yeah.

29:03.975 --> 29:06.443
I tell you what.

29:06.477 --> 29:07.944
Why don't you give me...

29:07.978 --> 29:10.279
60 seconds of awkward-date
conversation, all right?

29:10.314 --> 29:12.782
Ugh. Give me 60 seconds, all right,

29:12.817 --> 29:15.452
and then I will go hit
on that lovely young woman

29:15.486 --> 29:16.853
in the purple dress over there.

29:16.887 --> 29:20.256
You just think you can get some
business out of her, don't you?

29:20.290 --> 29:21.857
I feel like she could definitely benefit

29:21.891 --> 29:22.959
from a... a rhinoplasty.

29:22.993 --> 29:25.294
Maybe an eyebrow lift. And then I could...

29:25.329 --> 29:27.929
I think even I could do
something with that chin,

29:27.964 --> 29:28.630
to be honest with you.

29:28.665 --> 29:30.832
You little hustler. I'm a hustler?

29:30.867 --> 29:32.969
I wasn't the one stuffing
business cards in my boobs.

29:33.003 --> 29:35.037
Oh... did you see that?

29:35.072 --> 29:36.138
Everybody saw it.

29:36.173 --> 29:37.173
Aah, I thought I was being subtle.

29:37.207 --> 29:39.074
No, that's okay, I admire the move.

29:39.108 --> 29:41.142
You know, a less original girl would
have probably just used her purse.

29:42.846 --> 29:44.112
You're funny.

29:44.146 --> 29:46.047
- Thank you.
- Mm.

29:46.082 --> 29:48.584
All right, Doc. Do me.

29:48.618 --> 29:50.686
- Huh?
- To perfect this.

29:52.856 --> 29:54.655
- Nothing.
- Oh, come on.

29:54.690 --> 29:56.157
You can tell me. I won't get mad.

29:56.192 --> 29:59.827
Okay. Um... let's see.

29:59.862 --> 30:02.663
I would probably tell you

30:02.698 --> 30:06.101
to get out of my office
because you're stunning.

30:06.135 --> 30:10.505
Isn't she, though? You
mind if I steal her back?

30:10.539 --> 30:12.272
We were, uh, talking a bit of business.

30:12.307 --> 30:13.708
- Yeah, we were.
- Okay.

30:13.742 --> 30:15.142
No, I wouldn't want to get in
the middle of that business.

30:25.387 --> 30:27.221
That went well, didn't it?

30:27.255 --> 30:28.455
It was nice. Yeah.

30:28.490 --> 30:30.457
Though the beginning was a little, uh...

30:32.027 --> 30:34.461
Your friends seemed nervous.

30:34.496 --> 30:35.829
Oh, they did?

30:35.863 --> 30:38.999
Yeah, like they were afraid
to talk about themselves.

30:39.034 --> 30:43.170
I'm sorry. That was my fault.

30:43.204 --> 30:46.005
I think I might have
freaked them out beforehand.

30:46.040 --> 30:48.141
I told them not to talk
about certain things,

30:48.175 --> 30:50.410
and it just made them weird.

30:50.444 --> 30:51.344
Sorry.

30:51.378 --> 30:54.347
What things?

30:54.381 --> 30:57.017
What? Like, they a bunch of criminals?

30:57.051 --> 30:59.218
No.

30:59.253 --> 31:01.454
What? So you thought I was
gonna judge them or something?

31:01.488 --> 31:04.190
No! No, not at all. The
things were about me.

31:05.559 --> 31:08.061
Private things, you know.

31:08.095 --> 31:09.795
Private things.

31:09.829 --> 31:12.031
Personal things.

31:13.667 --> 31:16.635
Okay.

31:16.670 --> 31:17.970
You're upset.

31:18.004 --> 31:19.538
Well, I thought we were moving forward.

31:19.573 --> 31:20.873
We are.

31:20.907 --> 31:22.575
You wanted to meet my people.

31:22.609 --> 31:24.577
To get to know you more. Okay?

31:24.611 --> 31:26.579
Or... or to share more of your life.

31:26.613 --> 31:28.380
Not... not to make four new friends.

31:31.350 --> 31:34.652
No, you know, it's okay. Like, maybe...

31:34.687 --> 31:38.256
Maybe we just don't want the same things.

31:38.291 --> 31:42.827
We do want the same things.

31:42.828 --> 31:44.828
Daniel I wanna be with you.

31:45.565 --> 31:48.200
Look, it's late, okay?

31:48.234 --> 31:49.867
You know, we're both tired.

31:49.902 --> 31:51.603
Maybe I should just go home.

31:51.637 --> 31:53.738
Oh, no, come on. Please come inside.

31:53.772 --> 31:55.873
Good night, April.

32:08.089 --> 32:10.457
I just... I-I-I don't understand
what all these fees are for.

32:10.491 --> 32:11.958
I'm not overdrawn.

32:11.992 --> 32:14.627
W-what's my balance minimum?

32:16.361 --> 32:17.829
Okay. Well, just hold
it, just listen to me.

32:17.863 --> 32:20.532
I would pretty much be there
if you would put back in

32:20.566 --> 32:22.834
what you took out for
those ridiculous fees.

32:22.868 --> 32:24.335
No, are you... are you seriously doing this

32:24.369 --> 32:26.170
over a-a difference of $2?

32:27.440 --> 32:29.073
No, you know what? Hold on.

32:33.312 --> 32:34.445
Yes?

32:34.479 --> 32:35.947
- Hi, Josslyn Carver?
- Yeah.

32:35.981 --> 32:38.382
I have a delivery for you.
Just need your signature.

32:38.417 --> 32:40.884
- Okay.
- And initial here.

32:40.919 --> 32:42.519
Okay. Sorry. I'm in
the middle of something.

32:42.554 --> 32:43.988
And initial here.

32:44.022 --> 32:45.323
And one more time.

32:45.357 --> 32:48.158
- Thank you very much.
- Just you can just leave it...

32:48.192 --> 32:49.726
Oh, leave it right there.

32:50.762 --> 32:51.995
Whoa, wh...

32:52.029 --> 32:53.997
No, sir, this isn't for me.

32:54.031 --> 32:55.666
Enjoy.

32:59.904 --> 33:01.572
What?

33:03.640 --> 33:06.142
What's going on? Who do you belong to?

33:09.646 --> 33:11.948
"I think there was some
confusion last night.

33:11.983 --> 33:14.150
Here is a labradoodle for your ref..."

33:16.087 --> 33:19.222
Come on.

33:21.257 --> 33:23.092
Are you kidding me?

33:28.799 --> 33:32.234
I'd like to talk about something
you said about your escorting,

33:32.268 --> 33:35.237
that you felt it kept you
from spending nights alone.

33:35.271 --> 33:36.805
Did I say that?

33:36.839 --> 33:38.073
You did.

33:38.108 --> 33:40.042
Well, that's pathetic.

33:41.277 --> 33:43.912
It's not just that.

33:43.946 --> 33:45.747
It's...

33:45.781 --> 33:48.583
Fun, too.

33:48.618 --> 33:51.053
I mean... really fun.

33:51.087 --> 33:52.889
What's fun about it?

33:52.924 --> 33:56.025
Well, everything. Every moment.

33:59.328 --> 34:03.131
I walk in. It's a nice place.

34:03.165 --> 34:05.066
I'm wearing something gorgeous,

34:05.100 --> 34:07.769
silk, cashmere...

34:07.803 --> 34:11.772
It feels good on my skin.

34:11.806 --> 34:14.808
I walk by a table of men

34:14.842 --> 34:19.280
and I feel them looking at me, wanting me.

34:22.317 --> 34:27.454
I walk to the bar, watch the door,

34:27.487 --> 34:32.626
I see him walk in, but I
pretend I don't know him.

34:32.661 --> 34:37.297
He pretends he doesn't know me.

34:37.331 --> 34:39.266
He likes that...

34:39.300 --> 34:45.772
Feeling like it's some
kind of chance meeting.

34:45.806 --> 34:49.943
He likes feeling like,
out of all those guys

34:49.976 --> 34:52.612
in the bar watching...

34:52.646 --> 34:55.848
He won.

34:58.018 --> 35:01.654
And he doesn't know me, really.

35:01.689 --> 35:04.591
He thinks my name is Kate.

35:06.594 --> 35:08.595
And who is Kate?

35:08.629 --> 35:11.265
Whoever I want her to be.

35:12.099 --> 35:16.402
No past, no problems.

35:16.436 --> 35:19.171
She's totally free.

35:24.910 --> 35:28.346
Coming.

35:29.381 --> 35:30.881
Hi.

35:30.916 --> 35:33.884
Oh, good. You got them.

35:33.919 --> 35:34.720
What are these?

35:34.754 --> 35:37.389
They're Red Hot Chili Peppers tickets.

35:38.023 --> 35:39.590
You like them, don't you?

35:39.625 --> 35:40.825
How did you know that?

35:40.859 --> 35:42.392
Do you want to come inside?

35:42.427 --> 35:46.731
What else did you find out about me online?

35:46.765 --> 35:49.934
That my girlfriend left me

35:49.968 --> 35:52.036
and that I'm living on my friend's couch?

35:52.070 --> 35:57.040
No, I just felt bad about
what happened the other day.

35:57.074 --> 36:00.076
I wasn't nice, and I
wanted to apologize to you.

36:00.111 --> 36:02.412
I told you I didn't want anything from you.

36:02.447 --> 36:03.580
But you must,

36:03.615 --> 36:05.915
because you could have
just tore up those tickets.

36:05.950 --> 36:10.621
But instead you showed up at my doorstep.

36:10.622 --> 36:12.622
Again.

36:13.055 --> 36:16.357
Look...

36:16.991 --> 36:19.459
The accident really...

36:19.493 --> 36:22.295
Really messed me up.

36:22.329 --> 36:28.468
And I thought that if I came
here and found you a little...

36:28.502 --> 36:30.637
A little broken, too,

36:30.671 --> 36:36.309
that I wouldn't have to
feel so ashamed about it.

36:36.343 --> 36:39.312
But...

36:39.346 --> 36:42.982
You're not. You're fine.

36:43.016 --> 36:45.051
You haven't lost a damn thing.

36:45.085 --> 36:49.755
You have no idea what I have lost.

36:51.158 --> 36:53.458
I don't even know who I am anymore.

36:53.493 --> 36:59.698
Yeah, I'm surrounded by my friends

36:59.732 --> 37:05.470
and... and... at my old
job and in my house, but...

37:07.340 --> 37:11.810
I don't recognize myself in any of them.

37:11.844 --> 37:15.980
And you know why that is?

37:16.015 --> 37:20.785
Because I was supposed
to be a mother by now.

37:20.820 --> 37:22.954
I'm sorry. I...

37:22.988 --> 37:24.856
I didn't... didn't know.

37:25.160 --> 37:27.295
Oh, and I was ready.

37:27.330 --> 37:30.465
I was so... I was so ready.

37:31.934 --> 37:36.237
I bought the crib and the clothes...

37:36.271 --> 37:39.740
And I...

37:39.774 --> 37:44.078
I had names picked out.

37:44.112 --> 37:49.050
And I could feel her inside
me every moment of every day.

37:51.453 --> 37:54.755
I know what it feels like

37:54.789 --> 37:57.758
to lose everything that
you've been building,

37:57.792 --> 38:01.728
but, you know, you can get it back.

38:04.766 --> 38:08.034
I may never have that chance again.

38:47.897 --> 38:50.533
I was married.

38:50.967 --> 38:53.602
His name was Paul. We went
to high school together.

38:53.636 --> 38:54.870
We're not married anymore.

38:56.573 --> 39:00.408
Can that be enough for now?

39:16.925 --> 39:19.727
One cold Brewski.

39:19.761 --> 39:21.562
Wow.

39:21.597 --> 39:24.098
Looks like you got plenty
of leads there. That's great.

39:24.132 --> 39:25.833
Yeah, I got tons of business cards.

39:25.867 --> 39:27.835
One gig.

39:27.869 --> 39:30.671
I mingled my face off at that party, Harry,

39:30.706 --> 39:32.073
and that's all I have to show for it.

39:32.107 --> 39:33.907
- Mm.
- It's not enough.

39:33.941 --> 39:36.076
This was a mistake.

39:36.111 --> 39:38.445
It's... it's my big mistake,
it's not you. I'm sorry.

39:38.480 --> 39:39.746
One gig might not be enough,

39:39.780 --> 39:43.584
but, uh, the two I got
should put us in the green.

39:43.618 --> 39:45.785
Or black. Whatever.

39:45.820 --> 39:47.554
What are you talking about?

39:47.589 --> 39:49.555
Mm. Yeah, some jewelry launch.

39:49.590 --> 39:52.125
And another intimate
dinner party for 150 people.

39:52.159 --> 39:53.960
Oh, my God, what?! When?!

39:53.995 --> 39:56.129
Well, it seems you can
drum up a lot of business

39:56.163 --> 39:58.297
while you're, uh, hiding from your date.

39:58.332 --> 40:00.634
Boom.

40:00.668 --> 40:01.868
What is this?

40:01.902 --> 40:04.570
My share of the investment. 2,500 clams.

40:04.605 --> 40:06.071
What?

40:06.106 --> 40:08.608
Oh, I... I...

40:08.642 --> 40:10.376
No. Let's just call it even. Keep it.

40:10.410 --> 40:12.145
Okay.

40:12.179 --> 40:13.812
Yeah, for a, uh, commitment-phobe,

40:13.847 --> 40:15.948
you're pretty good at being all-in.

40:15.982 --> 40:18.050
I want you to know that I am, too.

40:18.084 --> 40:21.053
Oh, yeah, one more thing.
I broke up with Kyra.

40:21.087 --> 40:23.756
Oh, thank God.

40:23.790 --> 40:25.891
Yeah, last night was the
"aha" moment I needed.

40:25.925 --> 40:26.925
So thank you for that.

40:26.960 --> 40:28.593
- Aha.
- Appreciate it.

40:28.628 --> 40:31.930
Oh, and I'm really sorry
about all that Scott business.

40:31.965 --> 40:34.133
That was really awkward.

40:34.167 --> 40:36.434
Actually... he was not that bad.

40:36.469 --> 40:38.470
- Really?
- I know.

40:40.640 --> 40:42.073
When we come back,

40:42.107 --> 40:44.242
is a common household
product a threat to your pets?

40:44.277 --> 40:47.245
That's next on eyewitness news.

40:47.280 --> 40:50.248
Come on down prices so low you'll think...

40:52.451 --> 40:53.585
Hey.

40:53.619 --> 40:54.919
Hey.

40:54.953 --> 40:56.587
How was your day?

40:56.621 --> 40:59.957
Uneventful.

41:13.238 --> 41:15.539
I really...

41:15.574 --> 41:17.374
have to pee.

41:39.330 --> 41:42.999
I can't talk right now.

42:20.670 --> 42:22.671
Chardonnay, please.

42:30.179 --> 42:32.180
What's your name?

42:38.353 --> 42:40.788
I'm Jennifer.
