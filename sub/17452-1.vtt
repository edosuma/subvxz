02:20.184 --> 02:22.152
Oh, my God.

03:15.073 --> 03:17.541
- Will he live?
- Mm-hmm.

03:19.243 --> 03:22.838
- What's his name?
- I don't know. He's not my dog.

03:23.881 --> 03:25.781
I, um...

03:25.883 --> 03:28.909
I was driving through the
hills, and I hit him.

03:29.954 --> 03:31.854
It was really dark.

03:31.956 --> 03:34.356
Well, you brought him in.
You'll have to pay the bill.

03:34.459 --> 03:37.724
Of course I brought him in.
I hit him. It was my fault.

03:37.829 --> 03:41.356
- What do you do?
- I'm an actress.

03:41.466 --> 03:44.162
You act for nothing?

03:44.268 --> 03:47.169
I didn't say I wouldn't pay.
Of course I will pay the bill.

03:47.271 --> 03:50.069
- How much is it?
- $218.

03:50.174 --> 03:52.074
$218?

03:52.176 --> 03:55.407
That includes inoculation,
medicine and after-hour fees.

03:56.981 --> 03:58.949
- Do you take credit cards?
- All of them.

04:02.954 --> 04:05.218
Thank you.

04:05.323 --> 04:07.621
- He's gonna be okay, isn't he?
- Oh, yeah.

04:07.725 --> 04:09.693
He'll be fit to take
him home with you.

04:09.794 --> 04:12.763
Or board him here for
the night for $25.

04:12.864 --> 04:15.424
Well, I think somebody
must be looking for him.

04:15.533 --> 04:19.128
I suggest you take him to the
pound, unless you want to keep him.

04:19.237 --> 04:22.070
Is the pound where you
find lost animals?

04:22.173 --> 04:25.768
Yes, but if the owner doesn't claim him
in three days, he'll be put to sleep.

04:26.811 --> 04:28.779
- You mean they'd kill him?
- Yes.

04:30.882 --> 04:33.612
Well, maybe somebody at
the pound will adopt him.

04:33.718 --> 04:35.310
Not this dog.

04:35.419 --> 04:38.081
Why not?

04:39.290 --> 04:42.885
He's beautiful and he's strong.
He'd be a great family dog.

04:42.994 --> 04:46.122
Well, don't let his looks fool ya.
He's too old to adopt.

04:46.230 --> 04:49.757
They only adopt cute, little
puppies at the pound.

04:49.867 --> 04:52.495
Well, isn't there someplace
where someone will want him?

04:52.603 --> 04:55.037
No. S.P.C.A.

04:55.139 --> 04:57.471
Send in a photo of him
to list with "dog found"...

04:57.575 --> 04:59.770
and the owner will find you
if he checks with them.

04:59.877 --> 05:02.107
And put up posters in the
area where you hit him.

05:02.213 --> 05:04.579
And make sure you state
you want a reward.

05:04.682 --> 05:07.776
- Why a reward?
- You want your money back, don't you?

05:09.420 --> 05:12.548
Push two penicillin pills down
his throat twice a day...

05:12.657 --> 05:14.750
until the owner contacts you.

05:14.859 --> 05:17.191
- Down his throat?
- All the way down.

05:22.366 --> 05:24.664
Come on!

05:24.769 --> 05:27.897
Hey, boy!

05:28.005 --> 05:30.166
Mmm!

05:31.242 --> 05:34.541
Hey. Take your pill.
Take your pill.

05:39.817 --> 05:41.717
Come on.

05:41.819 --> 05:43.980
Open the mouth.
Take the pill. Take...

05:44.088 --> 05:46.818
Quit spittin' it out. Come on.

05:58.236 --> 06:01.137
This is really good for you.
You have to take it.

06:01.239 --> 06:03.332
Come on.

06:03.441 --> 06:05.409
All right. Forget it.
Come on. Come on.

06:05.509 --> 06:08.376
Come on! Okay.

06:08.479 --> 06:11.880
Sit down. There you go.
I got the camera.

06:11.983 --> 06:14.952
Okay. Look at me.
Come on. Look here.

06:15.052 --> 06:18.715
Look at this. Right here. Come on.
Yeah. Yeah, that's good.

06:18.823 --> 06:21.087
Good boy. Good job. There we go.

06:21.192 --> 06:23.217
Right there! Oh, oh,
that's great. Look at me.

06:23.327 --> 06:27.320
Oh, that's gonna be a good one.
This is not gonna hurt you.

06:27.431 --> 06:29.399
Come on.

06:44.315 --> 06:46.215
Hey!

06:46.317 --> 06:50.048
What are you doing? Hey.

06:53.157 --> 06:56.126
Listen. You're a single girl...

06:57.361 --> 07:00.228
living all by yourself
up in the hills.

07:00.331 --> 07:02.356
That is dangerous, Miss Julie.

07:02.466 --> 07:05.663
I know. But I like living alone.

07:07.772 --> 07:11.731
You know, for an
intelligent girl...

07:11.842 --> 07:14.367
sometimes you're not very bright.

07:16.180 --> 07:19.547
Look, if you won't let me move in
with you, at least keep the dog.

07:19.650 --> 07:21.641
- You'll have a bodyguard.
- Bodyguard.

07:21.752 --> 07:23.652
- Yeah.
- Oh.

07:23.754 --> 07:25.654
That's cute.

07:25.756 --> 07:28.190
No, it wouldn't be fair,
to me or the dog.

07:29.226 --> 07:33.788
Once you have a dog, you end up spending
more time with the dog, taking care of it...

07:33.898 --> 07:36.423
and not concentrating on your work.

07:36.534 --> 07:40.368
Ah, wait a minute. If that's true, how come
every time I see a picture of a big star...

07:40.471 --> 07:42.701
she's always surrounded by
three or four dogs, huh?

07:42.807 --> 07:44.900
They're rentals.

07:45.009 --> 07:48.069
- They are.
- You cynic.

07:48.179 --> 07:50.409
Come on.

08:29.320 --> 08:31.288
Thanks for today.

09:17.001 --> 09:19.128
No! No!

09:24.141 --> 09:27.599
No! No! No, no!

09:28.879 --> 09:31.848
You fight me, I'll kill ya.

09:50.401 --> 09:54.030
That was a swell bunch.

09:54.138 --> 09:57.630
I'm glad to have
been able to serve.

09:57.741 --> 10:01.438
<i>To tell you that we were
going out to bring back help.</i>

10:01.545 --> 10:05.106
Aah!

10:32.109 --> 10:35.772
No! No! No.

10:35.880 --> 10:38.007
Operator, give me the police.

10:45.923 --> 10:49.381
Oh! Aah! Aah!

10:54.932 --> 10:58.629
Same damn rapist
I nailed last year.

10:58.736 --> 11:01.068
- Okay, we'll read your rights.
- Come here.

11:01.172 --> 11:03.333
It's okay, boy. It's okay.

11:03.440 --> 11:05.908
You're lucky to have a dog
like that, young lady.

11:11.215 --> 11:13.683
Here. Shh.

11:13.784 --> 11:16.344
It's okay.

11:31.835 --> 11:34.326
- All done, Miss Sawyer.
- Thanks.

11:34.438 --> 11:36.338
Bye!

11:44.081 --> 11:46.709
Look what we got! A new window.

11:54.592 --> 11:56.560
Okay. Time to play.

12:16.046 --> 12:18.810
- Hello.
- Roland, the screen test went great!

12:18.916 --> 12:21.350
I think I've got it. They're
gonna see it tomorrow.

12:21.452 --> 12:24.080
Well, good. Good for you.
You deserve it.

12:24.188 --> 12:26.179
How you feeling?
You still have the shakes?

12:26.290 --> 12:29.453
Well, a little bit, here and there.

12:29.560 --> 12:31.619
How are your arms?
How are the bruises?

12:31.729 --> 12:33.629
Well, they covered
it up with makeup.

12:33.731 --> 12:37.599
Good. I hope they put that son
of a bitch away for life.

12:37.701 --> 12:40.226
Let's not talk about that anymore.

12:40.337 --> 12:43.602
- No one called to claim the dog.
- Good.

12:43.707 --> 12:46.699
Listen, beauty, about tonight...

12:46.810 --> 12:48.937
I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to cancel.

12:49.046 --> 12:51.310
I've got a meeting with
that producer, and it's...

12:51.415 --> 12:54.213
looks like he may give me a chance
to direct my own damn script.

12:54.318 --> 12:57.253
No! Roland, let me
call you right back.

12:57.354 --> 13:01.222
The dog got into my laundry and made
a big mess. Let me call you right back.

13:01.325 --> 13:04.692
Hey! What are you doin'? Those
are my underwear, not yours!

13:04.795 --> 13:07.628
Give me those. Give
me that! Give me that!

13:07.731 --> 13:11.758
Give me my underwear!
Give me that! Give it up!

13:11.869 --> 13:14.394
Such a sick dog.

13:14.505 --> 13:17.167
They're mine! Get... Give me that!

13:17.274 --> 13:19.572
They're mine, you little twit.

14:25.976 --> 14:27.876
Oh! Damn it.

14:44.361 --> 14:46.329
Oh.

14:59.576 --> 15:04.912
Clementine! Have you seen
a white German shepherd?

15:05.015 --> 15:07.415
No, I haven't, Julie.

15:13.157 --> 15:15.091
Los Angeles Animal Shelter.

15:15.192 --> 15:19.652
- Is this the pound?
- This is the animal shelter. May I help you?

15:19.763 --> 15:23.290
Uh, I lost a dog. A white German
shepherd. He's a male.

15:23.400 --> 15:26.858
What's the tag number?

15:26.970 --> 15:29.097
He lost his tag.

15:29.206 --> 15:31.572
- Well, what's the number?
- I don't know.

15:31.675 --> 15:34.269
I-I thought maybe you
people picked him up.

15:34.378 --> 15:37.870
Our last pickup truck
comes in around 5:00.

15:52.930 --> 15:55.057
Maybe he's too big
for the apartment.

17:11.642 --> 17:13.541
Excuse me.

17:13.644 --> 17:15.544
Snuffy. Snuffy?

17:15.646 --> 17:17.614
- Is that him?
- No.

17:22.920 --> 17:25.480
Pardon me.

17:25.589 --> 17:27.489
Snuffy?

17:29.092 --> 17:32.960
- Billy. Billy, get away from there.
- I don't see him in the other one either.

17:36.300 --> 17:38.495
Is that him?

17:38.602 --> 17:40.570
That's not him.

17:50.714 --> 17:52.773
Come on, girl.

17:54.151 --> 17:56.278
Here, sir. Sir?

17:56.386 --> 17:58.786
- Is that all of them?
- That's all of them.

17:59.890 --> 18:02.791
Sorry, folks. Maybe your animal
will be in tomorrow's pickup.

20:14.224 --> 20:17.421
- Hello.
- Julie. Terrible news.

20:17.527 --> 20:19.427
I'll find him.

20:19.529 --> 20:21.429
Find who?

20:23.300 --> 20:25.268
What's your terrible news?

20:25.368 --> 20:28.963
They picked Jessica Drummond for
the part. I just got it from the boss.

20:30.774 --> 20:32.867
But they haven't seen my test yet.

20:32.976 --> 20:36.673
She had it locked in from
the start. Tough luck, Julie.

20:36.780 --> 20:38.975
Good-bye.

20:39.082 --> 20:41.050
They haven't seen my test.

21:23.760 --> 21:26.593
- Operator.
- Give me the police.

21:30.100 --> 21:33.399
You scared the shit out
of me, you little shit!

21:39.009 --> 21:42.308
Look at you. You're a mess. Huh?

21:42.412 --> 21:44.937
Did you get in a fight?
Look at this.

21:45.048 --> 21:46.948
Come on, baby.

21:47.050 --> 21:50.019
It's okay.

21:50.120 --> 21:52.418
It's okay.

21:52.522 --> 21:54.422
What did you do to yourself?

22:00.597 --> 22:02.497
Bless you.

22:02.599 --> 22:06.558
- I think I'm gonna write a dog story.
- Yeah? Write about my dog.

22:07.604 --> 22:10.198
"My dog"?

22:10.307 --> 22:13.105
Well, why not? Maybe if I write about
him, they'll let me direct it.

22:13.210 --> 22:16.805
Mmm. And star both of us.
Then I could work.

22:16.913 --> 22:19.438
Hmm. You working tomorrow?

22:19.549 --> 22:22.814
Yeah. Molly and I play stewardesses
sightseeing in a gondola.

22:22.919 --> 22:26.616
- Oh, good. You got any lines?
- Two, and they're very boring.

22:27.657 --> 22:29.557
Very boring.

22:34.331 --> 22:36.999
Look, if we're supposed to be
celebrating return of the lone wolf,

22:37.000 --> 22:38.200
why are you so down?

22:40.937 --> 22:43.030
Is it 'cause you
didn't get the role?

22:44.741 --> 22:48.142
Darlin', she is not
the first girl...

22:48.245 --> 22:50.713
to have a role locked in
right from the start.

22:52.182 --> 22:54.377
But I could have done
something with that part.

22:55.952 --> 22:57.852
I know.

22:59.422 --> 23:02.983
- They didn't even look at my test.
- What was it, 20 seconds?

23:03.093 --> 23:05.687
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen.

23:05.795 --> 23:07.854
What can you do in 15 seconds, huh?

23:08.999 --> 23:10.626
- Huh?
- Nothing.

23:10.734 --> 23:13.396
- What's in the middle of a bagel?
- Nothing.

23:14.671 --> 23:18.732
Then why are we wasting
our time and good wine...

23:18.842 --> 23:20.969
talking about nothing, huh?

23:21.077 --> 23:23.045
- I don't know.
- Huh?

23:24.281 --> 23:26.181
Oh.

23:27.284 --> 23:29.252
Mmm.

23:30.787 --> 23:32.846
Could we maybe put him outside?

23:32.956 --> 23:34.856
Why?

23:39.763 --> 23:42.664
All right. I'll put him outside.

23:42.766 --> 23:45.234
Come back here. Come here.
Get off the couch.

23:45.335 --> 23:49.567
Come on. You're makin' a mess.
Come on. Get off! Come on.

23:49.673 --> 23:52.574
- Hey! Get off! Get... Ow!
- No, no. Be careful.

23:52.676 --> 23:54.871
Watch the feet! Watch the feet!

23:54.978 --> 23:57.503
Aah! I'm never gonna play the violin again.
What are you doin'? Ow!

23:57.614 --> 23:59.104
- Oh!
- Oh, that must hurt.

23:59.215 --> 24:01.115
What?

24:01.217 --> 24:03.981
You're in the picture. Back it off.

24:04.087 --> 24:07.454
- You look beautiful.
- Step out of the way, okay?

24:07.557 --> 24:09.525
Watch your back.

24:11.328 --> 24:13.523
- Well...
- How high?

24:13.630 --> 24:16.064
- Phil?
- Get that fan out, would you?

24:16.166 --> 24:18.498
- Boom. Pick up the boom.
- Little more with the fan.

24:18.601 --> 24:20.641
So how daringly?

24:20.670 --> 24:23.867
Get somebody in there
and see if you've got a part.

24:30.613 --> 24:33.411
You're all set now on what
you're supposed to do, huh?

24:33.516 --> 24:35.416
Okay. Terrific.

24:35.518 --> 24:38.885
The boat's gonna rock a little bit,
so don't let that throw you, okay?

24:38.989 --> 24:42.152
Yeah. Don't go overboard.

24:42.258 --> 24:44.818
Okay. Terrific.

24:44.928 --> 24:48.091
I want it on the record, Herb.
I'm shooting this under protest.

24:48.198 --> 24:50.325
It's out of sync. I'm getting
nothing but flicker.

24:50.433 --> 24:54.096
In France they call that "artistic".
As Truffaut would say, "formidable".

24:54.204 --> 24:56.138
- "Formidable".
- Okay. Let's go. Let's go.

24:56.239 --> 24:58.969
Stand by for picture!
Give me a bell!

24:59.075 --> 25:02.272
Roll 'em!

25:03.513 --> 25:05.947
Action.

25:06.049 --> 25:07.949
Isn't that pretty?

25:08.051 --> 25:10.849
- They're so pretty.
- Isn't that Lord Byron's house?

25:10.954 --> 25:13.388
I think so. I love his poetry.

25:13.490 --> 25:16.118
- It's beautiful.
- Oh, look! Look at that one.

25:18.561 --> 25:20.722
This is great.

25:20.830 --> 25:23.321
Oh, look over there.
It's so pretty.

25:23.433 --> 25:25.333
Hey.

25:25.435 --> 25:27.335
Got ya.

26:12.182 --> 26:16.243
All right. The dog isn't rabid.

26:16.352 --> 26:19.753
But any time in the last 10 days,
Molly could have pressed charges.

26:19.856 --> 26:23.348
Now, she didn't, but you're not
gonna be that lucky the next time.

26:23.460 --> 26:26.429
What do you mean, "next time"?

26:27.797 --> 26:29.731
There will be a next time!

26:29.833 --> 26:32.495
You've got yourself an attack dog!

26:32.602 --> 26:34.729
Hello.

26:34.838 --> 26:37.363
Oh, hi. Can I call you right back?

26:37.474 --> 26:39.442
Yeah. Bye.

26:40.643 --> 26:43.203
- I don't know what you're
talking about, Roland.
- Come on, Julie.

26:43.213 --> 26:46.080
A dog trained by professionals
to attack people.

26:46.182 --> 26:48.150
You have got to have him killed.

26:48.251 --> 26:51.311
Will you stop talking
about killing him?

26:51.421 --> 26:54.948
Listen to me. Molly wasn't his first victim.
Now, she certainly isn't gonna be his last.

26:55.058 --> 26:58.084
Please, darling, just take him
down to the pound right now.

26:58.194 --> 27:01.994
- It will be over in seconds.
- Do you know how they kill those dogs?

27:02.098 --> 27:04.123
I was there! I saw it!

27:04.234 --> 27:06.828
Now, wait a second! You don't
compare him to those animals!

27:06.936 --> 27:08.927
They are innocent!

27:09.038 --> 27:12.496
Now, that dog has got to be
stopped before he kills somebody!

27:12.609 --> 27:15.339
- That dog is sick!
- Then he should be cured.

27:15.445 --> 27:18.312
Darlin', the people that made him
sick made him permanently sick!

27:18.414 --> 27:20.314
Then they should be put
to sleep, not the dog!

27:20.416 --> 27:23.146
Aw, come on, Julie, you got
a four-legged time bomb!

27:23.253 --> 27:25.585
All right!

27:25.688 --> 27:30.057
So let's say somebody trained him to
be an attack dog. Let's just say that.

27:30.160 --> 27:33.021
There's gotta be a place where
they retrain these dogs,

27:33.022 --> 27:34.222
and I'll find that
place, that's all!

27:34.330 --> 27:36.924
Julie, now you listen to me.

27:39.369 --> 27:41.337
Jesus H. Christ.

27:43.506 --> 27:46.100
Julie, that son of a bitch is
ready to attack me right now.

27:46.209 --> 27:48.109
He's not gonna hurt you.

27:48.211 --> 27:51.738
Nobody... Nobody can retrain him
and guarantee him 100% safe.

27:51.848 --> 27:53.816
Nobody can do that.

27:53.917 --> 27:56.215
You made your point, Roland.
He's my responsibility.

27:56.319 --> 27:58.617
Goddamn it, Julie!
He could attack anybody.

27:58.721 --> 28:01.315
Bullshit! Nobody's gonna kill him!

28:01.424 --> 28:03.324
Nobody.

28:09.632 --> 28:13.659
I'm calling the cops, or I'm
gonna get chewed up trying.

28:18.408 --> 28:20.308
Please.

28:21.945 --> 28:24.413
There's gotta be somebody
who can help him.

28:29.319 --> 28:31.981
Please?

28:41.297 --> 28:44.027
Stay there!

28:47.036 --> 28:49.231
Shana. Shana. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

28:54.844 --> 28:57.745
Come on, Shana!

28:57.847 --> 29:00.873
Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup!

29:02.852 --> 29:06.754
Stay. Stay. Stay. Stay.

29:36.552 --> 29:38.611
Hi.

29:40.657 --> 29:42.784
Can I help you?

29:42.892 --> 29:45.952
Uh, a-are you Mrs. Carruthers?

29:46.062 --> 29:49.327
No, I'm Martine Dawson.

29:50.433 --> 29:52.492
I'm looking for Mr. Carruthers.

29:52.602 --> 29:56.766
Across the road. Little green
house on your left-hand side.

29:58.775 --> 30:00.675
Thanks.

30:02.512 --> 30:04.412
Bye.

30:07.250 --> 30:09.150
What? Quit.

30:10.353 --> 30:12.514
Quit.

30:12.622 --> 30:16.285
No can do, Mr. Driscoll. Too risky.

30:16.392 --> 30:19.759
Tell ya what... use our panther.

30:19.862 --> 30:22.990
He's safe, and he knows
every camera angle.

30:23.099 --> 30:26.466
Yeah. Good-bye. I got another call.

30:27.804 --> 30:30.830
Noah's Ark. Carruthers speaking.

30:30.940 --> 30:33.932
Hello, Mr. Kellogg.
What do you need?

30:34.043 --> 30:36.238
Uh, it's open! Come on in.

30:36.346 --> 30:39.804
Ah, that's impossible.
Mr. Keys is swamped.

30:39.916 --> 30:42.009
He's breakin' in a
load of wild animals.

30:42.118 --> 30:45.281
He's working the leopards and
jaguars for two features...

30:45.388 --> 30:49.848
and he's taming four crazy
chimps for a movie of the week.

30:49.959 --> 30:52.894
Sit down, honey. Make
yourself comfortable.

30:52.995 --> 30:56.328
All I can do for ya, Mr. Kellogg,
is to give you another man...

30:56.432 --> 31:00.528
who will get our tiger to sit on the
automobile with a girl in a bikini.

31:00.636 --> 31:04.572
And he'll see to it that she's
not bitten on her finer parts.

31:04.674 --> 31:06.574
Weekly rate.

31:06.676 --> 31:09.873
Bye-bye.

31:10.980 --> 31:15.314
Well, what kind of an
animal do you want to rent?

31:15.418 --> 31:18.581
You doin' a TV show,
a movie or a commercial?

31:18.688 --> 31:22.818
I tell ya, we've got the smartest
gorilla in the business.

31:22.925 --> 31:24.893
Does great documentaries.

31:24.994 --> 31:28.191
- I've got a problem.
- You have a problem?

31:28.297 --> 31:31.164
Let me tell you about problems.

31:31.267 --> 31:35.203
That! That is the enemy.

31:38.307 --> 31:41.970
Over 40 years of training
animals for the movies...

31:42.078 --> 31:45.275
and it's come down to
putting us in storage...

31:45.381 --> 31:48.179
for a piece of tin with
blinkin' red lights!

31:48.284 --> 31:50.309
- Are you married?
- No.

31:50.420 --> 31:52.888
- Any children?
- No.

31:52.989 --> 31:57.392
When you do have them, by the time
they're 25, there won't be any animals.

31:57.493 --> 31:59.188
Mr. Carruthers...

31:59.295 --> 32:01.490
Did you happen to see...

32:01.597 --> 32:03.565
Did you happen to see True Grit?

32:09.672 --> 32:14.132
Remember when Duke reached down with his
hand into that hole full of rattlers?

32:15.178 --> 32:17.408
That's the hand that did it.

32:17.513 --> 32:20.880
That's the hand that
helped Duke win the Oscar!

32:20.983 --> 32:24.077
I really do have a problem.

32:32.328 --> 32:34.296
I'm listenin'.

32:36.566 --> 32:38.966
I'd like you to teach him,

32:39.068 --> 32:41.969
or rather, unteach him...

32:42.071 --> 32:45.404
something bad that he's
been taught to do.

32:51.247 --> 32:53.215
He's an attack dog.

32:56.853 --> 32:59.447
Yeah.

33:01.724 --> 33:04.716
Good friend of mine had a German
shepherd for eight years.

33:06.696 --> 33:08.596
Lived with him.

33:08.698 --> 33:11.132
Slept with him. Hunted
and fished with him.

33:11.234 --> 33:13.168
Did everything with him.

33:13.269 --> 33:17.706
Then one night that dog turned and
chewed my friend's jugular out.

33:21.010 --> 33:23.342
That dog was an old attack dog.

33:26.816 --> 33:28.511
Can you help him?

33:29.986 --> 33:33.183
- Can't.
- Why not?

33:34.690 --> 33:37.955
Can't nobody can unlearn
a dog. Nobody.

33:38.060 --> 33:40.255
Well, there's gotta be someplace.
There's gotta be someone who can.

33:40.363 --> 33:42.331
I mean, you have to know someone.

33:42.431 --> 33:44.558
Well, there is.

33:44.667 --> 33:46.897
Who?

33:47.003 --> 33:49.972
Well, I heard about him years ago.

33:50.072 --> 33:52.370
Can't even recall his name.

33:52.475 --> 33:54.670
He's probably dead now.

33:56.412 --> 33:59.245
You're my last resort.

33:59.348 --> 34:01.816
And if you don't help him,
they're gonna kill him.

34:04.053 --> 34:06.613
They should.

34:06.722 --> 34:09.156
They should, miss.

34:10.927 --> 34:13.360
Let me give you a little tip.

34:13.462 --> 34:17.398
You take that dog right
down to the pound.

34:17.500 --> 34:21.061
With that dog out of circulation...

34:21.170 --> 34:24.036
there'll be a lot of people
sleep better tonight.

34:25.841 --> 34:29.038
There's nothing I can do for
an attack dog that's gone bad.

34:42.091 --> 34:43.991
I am sorry.

34:57.907 --> 35:01.343
Help me! Help me! Help me!

35:29.038 --> 35:33.304
That ain't no attack dog you got.
That's a white dog!

35:33.409 --> 35:37.004
- Of course he's a white dog.
- I don't mean his color!

35:37.113 --> 35:39.673
He's taught to attack
and kill black people!

35:39.782 --> 35:41.943
That's crazy! I don't believe that!

35:42.051 --> 35:45.020
What the hell you mean, huh?

35:45.121 --> 35:48.454
You see this scar, lady?
You see this goddamn scar?

35:48.557 --> 35:51.185
Well, I got that when
I was 14 years old.

35:51.293 --> 35:53.261
A white dog did it!

36:01.937 --> 36:05.270
I'm gonna call the police. I'm gonna tell
'em we got a goddamn white dog here.

36:05.374 --> 36:07.467
Joe, forget the police.

36:08.577 --> 36:11.637
And as for the rest of the men,
he's just an attack dog.

36:11.747 --> 36:13.647
Understood?

36:19.655 --> 36:22.681
Keys, if you work
on that bastard...

36:24.827 --> 36:26.624
I go.

36:26.729 --> 36:29.027
Damn it, Keys!
Don't start that again!

36:29.131 --> 36:31.224
You ain't got the time!

36:31.333 --> 36:34.268
Take five weeks vacation, Joe.

36:34.370 --> 36:36.770
If I don't break him...

36:36.872 --> 36:38.840
I'll shoot him.

36:53.322 --> 36:55.290
Come in.

36:56.826 --> 36:59.556
I hope you didn't bring
that damn dog with you.

37:01.530 --> 37:03.623
They didn't allow
visitors until now.

37:03.733 --> 37:05.928
Well, I'm glad you're
the first one, Julie.

37:12.508 --> 37:16.638
Julie, don't make me feel any worse
with that long, guilty face of yours.

37:17.680 --> 37:19.807
It wasn't your fault.

37:19.915 --> 37:21.883
It was an accident.

37:22.952 --> 37:25.420
Come over here. Sit down.

37:25.521 --> 37:27.421
Come on.

37:30.259 --> 37:34.719
And besides, I'm fully covered by the
Screen Actors Guild and Blue Cross.

37:34.830 --> 37:38.425
Molly.

37:38.534 --> 37:41.765
Julie, don't ask if there's
anything you can do for me.

37:41.871 --> 37:44.339
You've done it. You're here.

37:46.442 --> 37:49.536
Where did you get that
hound of the Baskervilles?

37:49.645 --> 37:51.806
I found him in the hills.

37:51.914 --> 37:54.041
Aha!

37:54.150 --> 37:57.210
That's the danger in
picking up a stranger.

37:57.319 --> 38:00.049
You don't know what family
background he's got.

38:00.156 --> 38:02.124
Is he still with you?

38:03.859 --> 38:06.555
- No.
- Good.

38:07.830 --> 38:11.322
You know, I've gone over it
in my head a hundred times.

38:11.433 --> 38:13.663
What do you think
spooked that mutt?

38:17.907 --> 38:19.875
I don't know.

38:21.610 --> 38:24.078
Give it all you got. Come on!

38:54.043 --> 38:58.139
The old man's still blunting all the
syringe heads on this damn robot.

38:58.247 --> 39:01.182
Well, all I know is this
tranquilizer gun needs cleaning...

39:01.283 --> 39:03.410
and I'm working with
an elephant today.

39:03.519 --> 39:05.419
- I'll clean it.
- Thanks.

39:05.521 --> 39:07.648
Where the hell'd he
hide 'em this time?

39:07.756 --> 39:09.724
Ah, there they are.

39:11.594 --> 39:14.688
I'm gonna trick him into using
some of these regular darts.

39:57.206 --> 40:00.471
You're too tired to even try, huh?

40:07.016 --> 40:09.007
Can you tell me where
I can find Mr. Keys?

40:09.118 --> 40:11.916
You can't bother him right now,
young lady. He's workin' a lion.

40:12.021 --> 40:14.854
- Are you the owner of that attack dog?
- Yes.

40:14.957 --> 40:17.255
Yeah, he said somethin'
about you comin'.

40:19.728 --> 40:22.322
Up this road. On the
right is the arena.

40:22.431 --> 40:25.298
You can't miss it. It's
a big dome with bars.

40:25.401 --> 40:28.598
You can't drive up there. You gotta walk.
There's no, uh, visitors' parking up there.

40:28.704 --> 40:30.672
- Thank you.
- Sure.

40:38.080 --> 40:41.311
Now, Warners okayed the money
on that wild cat deal...

40:41.417 --> 40:43.908
but he's got to be
ready on the 16th.

40:44.019 --> 40:47.147
And you're gonna need a hell
of a lot of time to crack him.

40:47.256 --> 40:49.724
Good morning, Mr. Keys.

40:49.825 --> 40:51.793
Good morning, Miss Sawyer.

40:51.894 --> 40:53.794
Good morning, Mr. Carruthers.

40:53.896 --> 40:56.888
- What's good about it?
- Keys letting me watch him work.

40:56.999 --> 40:58.626
Huh.

40:58.734 --> 41:02.636
That old dog of yours is
unusually powerful, Miss Sawyer.

41:03.672 --> 41:05.970
- You can call me Julie, you know.
- Ah, thanks.

41:06.075 --> 41:09.067
Well, Julie, that means that
I'm gonna have to be...

41:09.178 --> 41:12.705
stronger and meaner
to wear him down.

41:12.815 --> 41:15.648
That's just the rock
bottom beginning.

41:15.751 --> 41:20.450
I got to wear him down till he realizes
it does him no good to attack me.

41:21.557 --> 41:24.117
- And then he's cured?
- Oh, no.

41:24.226 --> 41:28.185
Then comes the permanent
reconditioning of his brain.

41:28.297 --> 41:32.427
- Here.
- Now we move into step two...

41:33.469 --> 41:35.369
of the procedure.

41:35.471 --> 41:37.996
What was step one?

41:39.875 --> 41:41.843
With the muzzle.

41:43.178 --> 41:45.112
You better get in that
cage next to him.

41:45.214 --> 41:48.377
He would never hurt me.
Would ya, huh?

41:49.818 --> 41:51.786
Get in the cage, please.

41:54.223 --> 41:56.123
Julie.

43:51.940 --> 43:54.875
I'm gonna make you learn...

43:55.911 --> 43:58.539
that it's useless to
attack black skin.

43:58.647 --> 44:00.547
Go on.

44:07.623 --> 44:11.423
All right. There it is.
See, it's not your enemy.

44:12.461 --> 44:14.793
Sniff it.

44:14.897 --> 44:16.797
Not yet, huh?

45:03.345 --> 45:05.836
I don't understand.
One minute he...

45:05.948 --> 45:08.508
he's gentle as a lamb, and the
next minute he's a monster.

45:08.617 --> 45:10.517
He's not the monster.

45:10.619 --> 45:14.385
No, he was made into one
by a two-legged racist.

45:15.524 --> 45:18.357
You know, I don't understand how
that can happen. I... I really don't.

45:18.460 --> 45:21.020
How can... How can someone
turn a dog into a racist?

45:21.129 --> 45:26.431
Well, over a hundred years ago, they
raised dogs to catch runaway slaves.

45:26.535 --> 45:30.938
Then they progressed... to track
down runaway black convicts.

45:31.039 --> 45:33.337
What about runaway white convicts?

45:35.143 --> 45:39.045
Well, almost overnight...

45:39.147 --> 45:43.174
they graduated to a vicious
breed of watchdogs...

45:43.285 --> 45:46.777
trained to tear apart
any blacks within sight.

45:46.888 --> 45:48.788
Does he attack any other color?

45:49.891 --> 45:52.519
No. Dogs live in a
black-and-white world.

45:52.628 --> 45:56.530
Unlike ours, they live it
visually and not racially.

46:00.035 --> 46:03.027
- The man who owned him...
- Yes?

46:04.139 --> 46:07.575
- How did he turn him into a racist dog?
- It's simple.

46:08.677 --> 46:11.043
Find a black wino who
desperately needs a drink...

46:11.146 --> 46:15.242
or a black junkie who'll
do anything for a fix...

46:15.350 --> 46:19.616
and then pay them to beat that dog
of yours when he was a puppy.

46:20.722 --> 46:22.622
A puppy?

46:22.724 --> 46:24.885
The younger the better.

46:24.993 --> 46:30.226
And as the dog grew up, those
methodical beatings by blacks...

46:30.332 --> 46:32.562
planted that seed of fear in him.

46:32.668 --> 46:35.228
And that fear became
hate, and that hate...

46:35.337 --> 46:38.738
conditioned him to attack
the color black before...

46:38.840 --> 46:41.400
Before black can attack him.

46:45.013 --> 46:47.004
Well, can't the sick
part of him be cut out?

46:47.115 --> 46:49.379
- Like... like a cancer?
- Oh, yes.

46:49.484 --> 46:53.648
But, to me, lobotomy is
a barbaric recourse.

46:55.757 --> 46:58.717
You see, Julie, I'd like to develop a
foolproof method of reconditioning...

46:58.727 --> 47:02.219
so that anyone, anywhere,
within a matter of weeks...

47:02.331 --> 47:07.291
will be able to eradicate that
racist poisoning permanently.

47:07.402 --> 47:11.934
Maybe that way that'll stop bigots
from investing hate and time

47:11.935 --> 47:13.135
into dogs like yours.

47:13.141 --> 47:15.939
Has anyone ever tried doing
that... without surgery?

47:17.012 --> 47:20.470
Oh, yeah. A number of
animal experts, you know...

47:20.582 --> 47:23.608
but they all stop when they
reach that same danger zone...

47:23.719 --> 47:28.918
that crucial instant where tampering with
a dog's twisted mind just boomerangs.

47:31.560 --> 47:33.528
And then what?

47:34.563 --> 47:39.296
Homicidal maniac. He could
turn on... anybody.

47:41.169 --> 47:43.069
Even me?

47:45.340 --> 47:47.535
Twice I've gotten into the
brain of a white dog.

47:47.642 --> 47:50.702
Twice I've come that close...

47:50.812 --> 47:54.145
to cutting out that savagery
without using a knife.

47:55.283 --> 47:57.649
And both times the
experiment failed.

48:05.827 --> 48:07.920
Ah, she's a beauty.

48:08.029 --> 48:09.758
You sure you got the right one?

48:09.865 --> 48:11.765
Ask Teddy.

48:11.867 --> 48:13.835
No, thank you.

48:18.440 --> 48:20.374
Ah, it's a big molar.

48:20.475 --> 48:23.205
Yeah. Be nice to add to your
collection on that necklace.

48:23.311 --> 48:25.211
Yeah.

48:27.349 --> 48:30.546
Did I ever tell you about the time
I pulled the tooth of a billy goat?

48:30.652 --> 48:32.779
No, Carruthers, I don't
believe you ever have.

48:32.888 --> 48:36.051
Well, I had this billy goat, and he
was mean as a striped-ass spider.

51:12.981 --> 51:16.508
Hi, handsome.
Look what I got for you.

51:19.187 --> 51:21.155
Look. Look at that.

51:24.225 --> 51:27.353
You're gonna like this.
You like the bun, huh?

51:27.462 --> 51:30.898
Juicy hamburger.

51:43.845 --> 51:47.645
No one but this color black
feeds that dog! No one!

51:49.250 --> 51:51.616
He's got to know
he's stuck with me.

52:13.508 --> 52:14.600
Julie.

52:17.212 --> 52:19.680
What happened to that
pretty face of yours?

52:19.781 --> 52:23.148
You like you got caught with
your hand in a cookie jar.

52:25.487 --> 52:28.081
Keys caught me.

52:28.189 --> 52:30.123
Doing something naughty?

52:32.060 --> 52:34.051
Yeah, something real naughty.

52:34.162 --> 52:36.130
Something really stupid.

52:36.231 --> 52:38.563
Did he chew you out?

52:38.667 --> 52:40.897
He should have spanked me.

52:41.002 --> 52:42.970
What did you do?

52:43.071 --> 52:46.563
I fed Mr. Hyde.

52:52.213 --> 52:55.546
Hell, that'll set Keys back
a full week of work...

52:56.751 --> 52:59.914
trying to change that dog
back into Dr. Jekyll.

56:13.147 --> 56:15.741
Hey, Keys.

56:15.850 --> 56:18.216
Keys.

56:18.319 --> 56:21.550
Hey, Keys.

56:21.656 --> 56:24.523
- Hey.
- Yo.

56:24.626 --> 56:28.153
That damn mutt of yours bit
his way out through the roof.

56:29.197 --> 56:32.098
He'll probably try to climb over
the fence, like that bobcat.

56:32.200 --> 56:35.397
Well, if he does, he's gonna
have an electric hangover.

56:35.503 --> 56:37.471
It'll serve him right.

57:14.676 --> 57:16.610
Hello.

57:16.711 --> 57:18.702
The dog busted out of the compound.

57:19.747 --> 57:23.410
I think he must have hit a branch
and set off the electrified fence.

57:23.518 --> 57:26.214
Now, as soon as it's light,
we'll try to find him.

01:02:29.924 --> 01:02:32.791
He killed a man. In a church.

01:02:43.337 --> 01:02:47.637
And I'm sure it's not the
first black man he's killed.

01:02:47.742 --> 01:02:50.176
Why didn't you kill him?

01:02:50.278 --> 01:02:53.008
I wanted to shoot
him at the church.

01:02:53.114 --> 01:02:55.014
- Why didn't you?
- Oh...

01:02:55.116 --> 01:02:57.778
how I wanted to put a bullet
in that son of a bitch!

01:02:57.885 --> 01:02:59.580
Then why the hell didn't you?

01:03:01.088 --> 01:03:03.283
Because there's still
a chance to cure him.

01:03:03.391 --> 01:03:05.291
Cure him?

01:03:05.393 --> 01:03:08.760
He just killed a man. There is
no way you can cure that dog!

01:03:08.863 --> 01:03:11.889
I want you to shoot him now,
before he kills more blacks!

01:03:11.999 --> 01:03:14.331
So you finally joined the club.

01:03:14.435 --> 01:03:18.303
That club of horrified people who
raise holy hell about that disease...

01:03:18.406 --> 01:03:21.398
that racist hate... but do
absolutely nothing to stamp it out.

01:03:21.509 --> 01:03:26.003
That dog is the only weapon we have
at least to remove a part of it!

01:03:26.113 --> 01:03:28.081
If I cure him.

01:03:28.182 --> 01:03:30.082
If?

01:03:30.184 --> 01:03:32.482
"If" is not gonna stop
him from killing people!

01:03:32.586 --> 01:03:36.078
Yes, Julie. I can't
guarantee the result.

01:03:38.125 --> 01:03:40.559
But if I fail...

01:03:40.661 --> 01:03:42.561
I'll get another white dog...

01:03:42.663 --> 01:03:45.757
and another, or another,
or another, and another...

01:03:45.866 --> 01:03:47.891
and keep on working till I lick it.

01:03:48.002 --> 01:03:52.405
Because that's the only way to stop
sick people from breeding sick dogs.

01:03:53.441 --> 01:03:55.841
And goddamn it...

01:03:55.943 --> 01:03:58.776
I can't experiment on a dead dog.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.968
I'm gonna break ya.

01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:24.503
I'm not through with you... yet.

01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:02.420
Well...

01:07:08.636 --> 01:07:12.470
Come on. This Romanian caviar
is too good to go to waste.

01:07:13.874 --> 01:07:16.775
Well, I feel like all three
of us are conspirators.

01:07:18.012 --> 01:07:19.980
We are.

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:23.174
Well, we'd better get
ready for the pokey then.

01:07:23.284 --> 01:07:28.278
Now look. That dog could have
snapped off this black enemy hand.

01:07:28.389 --> 01:07:30.289
But look, it's-it's intact.

01:07:30.391 --> 01:07:32.859
And that's a spark
of reconditioning.

01:07:35.529 --> 01:07:37.429
To our first breakthrough.

01:07:39.133 --> 01:07:41.431
Okay.

01:07:42.603 --> 01:07:45.094
To the hamburger.

01:07:54.782 --> 01:07:56.943
How did he get into all this?

01:07:57.051 --> 01:07:59.884
- What?
- All this.

01:07:59.987 --> 01:08:02.182
All of what? Oh.

01:08:02.289 --> 01:08:04.189
That's breeding.

01:08:04.291 --> 01:08:08.057
Keys was suckled on anthropology.

01:08:08.162 --> 01:08:11.620
His mother teaches it, and
his father writes about it.

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:23.840
Keys drives a Mercedes-Benz
while his classmates...

01:08:23.944 --> 01:08:26.707
teaches grammar to
little knotheads.

01:08:28.816 --> 01:08:33.276
That must be Tom with the
serum for those Kodiaks, huh?

01:08:33.386 --> 01:08:36.254
- Yep.
- Don't you miss what your parents do?

01:08:36.357 --> 01:08:38.256
Oh, no.

01:08:38.359 --> 01:08:40.589
No. They're welcome to
their academic world.

01:08:40.694 --> 01:08:43.754
I-I can live where I want
and go where I please...

01:08:43.863 --> 01:08:46.162
and work where I live.

01:08:46.265 --> 01:08:49.326
You know, and every cage in
that compound is a test tube.

01:08:49.435 --> 01:08:52.769
I mean, to me, Noah's Ark
is like a laboratory...

01:08:52.872 --> 01:08:55.808
that, uh, Darwin himself
would go ape over.

01:08:55.908 --> 01:08:57.809
Oh, please. Come on.

01:08:57.911 --> 01:08:59.810
- Help yourself.
- Thank you.

01:08:59.912 --> 01:09:01.380
- Uh-huh.
- These smell good.

01:09:01.482 --> 01:09:03.381
- While it's hot.
- Mmm.

01:09:03.484 --> 01:09:05.452
Sour cream.

01:09:05.551 --> 01:09:07.611
- Love it.
- Fattening.

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:09.621
Good. Oh.

01:09:09.723 --> 01:09:11.189
- Have some.
- My diet...

01:09:11.291 --> 01:09:13.259
Come on in, Tom.

01:09:14.662 --> 01:09:18.393
Oh. Sorry to bother you folks.

01:09:18.499 --> 01:09:20.399
I'm from San Berdoo.

01:09:20.501 --> 01:09:22.560
I'm looking for Yakima Crossing.

01:09:24.371 --> 01:09:27.169
Oh, it's about, uh, 10
miles further up the road.

01:09:27.274 --> 01:09:31.176
Uh, it's the second turn on
your left. There's no sign.

01:09:31.278 --> 01:09:34.212
Uh-huh. Thank you.
Enjoy your dinner, folks.

01:09:34.314 --> 01:09:36.282
Good night.

01:10:01.909 --> 01:10:04.503
Now listen.

01:10:04.611 --> 01:10:07.409
We all know that...

01:10:07.514 --> 01:10:10.915
in the long run, what we're
doin' with this dog is proper.

01:10:11.018 --> 01:10:13.816
It's right. It's humane.

01:10:14.988 --> 01:10:18.185
Now, the officials... they...

01:10:18.292 --> 01:10:20.817
they won't understand that.

01:10:20.928 --> 01:10:23.488
They believe in long words and...

01:10:23.597 --> 01:10:25.531
long prison terms.

01:10:28.168 --> 01:10:31.660
They won't give a tinker's damn
for a dog with a mental problem.

01:10:31.772 --> 01:10:35.708
They'll just shoot him.

01:10:36.810 --> 01:10:39.506
Well...

01:10:39.613 --> 01:10:42.411
what I'm sayin' is...

01:10:42.516 --> 01:10:44.484
if this gets out...

01:10:46.553 --> 01:10:49.249
we're in trouble.

01:11:00.467 --> 01:11:02.367
Oh, to hell with all this.

01:11:02.469 --> 01:11:04.369
Let's get at these lamb chops.

01:11:04.471 --> 01:11:06.996
Come on. Let's eat.

01:11:07.107 --> 01:11:10.008
Come on. Forget it.

01:11:11.979 --> 01:11:13.879
- All right.
- Go. Come on.

01:11:13.981 --> 01:11:17.644
- Well...
- Keys.

01:11:17.751 --> 01:11:21.551
Now I know why it took you so long to
get that dog to eat out of your hand.

01:12:42.703 --> 01:12:45.968
Boy, come here. Come here.

01:12:46.073 --> 01:12:48.007
Yeah.

01:12:48.108 --> 01:12:50.076
Hey.

01:12:57.184 --> 01:13:00.210
Ah. Good boy.

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:02.550
That didn't hurt, did it?

01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:05.751
You're a weird one, you know that?

01:13:05.859 --> 01:13:10.057
Yeah. So you're finally
beginning to trust me, huh?

01:13:11.231 --> 01:13:14.064
Now, you're gonna remember this
tomorrow, now, aren't you?

01:13:14.167 --> 01:13:17.568
Good dog. Yeah.

01:13:17.671 --> 01:13:19.969
Good boy. Yeah.

01:13:24.111 --> 01:13:26.978
Yeah. One last test, okay?

01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:30.413
Hey.

01:14:00.347 --> 01:14:03.407
Well, a blessing from heaven, Keys.

01:14:03.517 --> 01:14:06.816
Five weeks are up, and
you've licked the disease.

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:08.820
I don't think so.

01:14:08.922 --> 01:14:11.857
What the hell is there to
think about? Look at him.

01:14:11.959 --> 01:14:14.086
All that black skin for
him to be chewin' on...

01:14:14.194 --> 01:14:16.594
and he's happy as a clam,
eatin' like a horse.

01:14:16.697 --> 01:14:20.224
That's no proof he's
permanently reconditioned.

01:14:20.334 --> 01:14:22.302
I'm kind to him, Jack.

01:14:22.402 --> 01:14:26.236
He finally learned to
love and trust me.

01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:28.433
But he only knows
that my blackness...

01:14:28.542 --> 01:14:32.979
is no longer the enemy he's been
trained to hate and attack.

01:14:34.982 --> 01:14:37.917
Well, in my book, your
experiment is a howling success.

01:14:38.018 --> 01:14:39.918
Not yet.

01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:44.855
I have to test him with a black who hasn't
fed him... somebody he doesn't know.

01:14:44.958 --> 01:14:46.926
A new black enemy.

01:14:52.933 --> 01:14:56.164
Charlie, I guarantee
you won't get hurt.

01:16:24.124 --> 01:16:26.024
Good.

01:16:26.126 --> 01:16:28.117
Nice boy.

01:16:38.638 --> 01:16:41.436
Easy does it. Easy.

01:16:41.541 --> 01:16:45.477
Easy. Aw.

01:16:45.579 --> 01:16:47.547
Good boy.

01:18:04.090 --> 01:18:08.789
Well, Julie is sitting on a hot
griddle waiting for your miracle.

01:18:08.895 --> 01:18:12.387
Why don't you give her a call and tell
her he's a hundred percent cured?

01:18:13.967 --> 01:18:17.698
- Ninety-nine.
- One percent.

01:18:17.804 --> 01:18:21.399
Now, that percent has
got me in a corner.

01:18:21.508 --> 01:18:25.000
He's still on the razor's
edge of a mental breakdown.

01:18:26.112 --> 01:18:30.549
That dog's been subjected to so much
brutal punishment, anything can explode.

01:18:30.650 --> 01:18:32.948
Come on. Call her.

01:18:53.707 --> 01:18:56.904
- Hello.
- Julie. Keys.

01:18:57.010 --> 01:18:59.137
Um...

01:18:59.246 --> 01:19:02.841
well, as soon as you can get here,
I'll make the final, crucial test.

01:19:02.949 --> 01:19:04.849
Uh...

01:19:04.951 --> 01:19:06.919
I would say it's, uh...

01:19:08.188 --> 01:19:10.383
almost "V" for victory.

01:19:10.490 --> 01:19:12.458
I'll be right there!

01:19:19.966 --> 01:19:21.934
Miss Julie Sawyer?

01:19:22.035 --> 01:19:24.367
- Yes?
- I'm Wilber Hull.

01:19:24.471 --> 01:19:27.235
These are my grandchildren.
Helen here is six.

01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:29.433
- Theona's eight.
- Oh.

01:19:29.542 --> 01:19:31.237
- Hi.
- This is the lady.

01:19:31.344 --> 01:19:32.572
Hello, Miss Sawyer.

01:19:33.713 --> 01:19:35.408
Hello, Miss Sawyer.

01:19:35.515 --> 01:19:38.450
Hi. I'm in a real big hurry.
You'll have to excuse me.

01:19:38.551 --> 01:19:41.145
W... Uh...

01:19:41.254 --> 01:19:42.619
Where's my dog?

01:19:48.828 --> 01:19:52.559
The S.P.C.A. Said you have
our dog, Miss Sawyer.

01:19:52.666 --> 01:19:55.601
He ran away from the trailer park.

01:19:55.702 --> 01:19:58.296
We're very grateful you
took such good care of him.

01:19:58.405 --> 01:20:00.430
We've brought you some chocolates.

01:20:09.616 --> 01:20:12.517
- Did you train him?
- I sure did.

01:20:12.619 --> 01:20:15.144
Since he was just a puppy.

01:20:21.695 --> 01:20:23.595
To be a white dog?

01:20:35.208 --> 01:20:38.041
And the best of the lot.

01:20:39.713 --> 01:20:41.772
You bastard!

01:20:41.881 --> 01:20:44.247
- You look here, young lady.
- You sick son of a bitch!

01:20:44.351 --> 01:20:47.191
You got two puppies there. You gonna
teach 'em to be as sick as you are?

01:20:47.287 --> 01:20:50.051
Do you know what your
grandfather did to that dog?

01:20:50.156 --> 01:20:52.021
He turned that dog into a monster!

01:20:52.125 --> 01:20:53.353
A killer!

01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:55.451
Don't you let him turn you
into monsters either!

01:20:55.562 --> 01:20:58.861
Don't listen to a damn word he says
about anything! Not a damn word!

01:20:58.965 --> 01:21:01.832
You shut your damn mouth!

01:21:01.935 --> 01:21:03.835
- Don't even touch me!
- Why, you...

01:21:03.937 --> 01:21:06.337
You sick son of a bitch!

01:21:06.439 --> 01:21:09.203
If you don't give us our dog
back, I'll go to the police.

01:21:09.309 --> 01:21:11.743
Go to the police!
Go, you son of a bitch!

01:21:11.845 --> 01:21:14.473
I'd like to see you walk in
there and tell them this story.

01:21:14.581 --> 01:21:16.481
Then I'd like to haul
your ass in court...

01:21:16.583 --> 01:21:19.074
and expose your sick mind for
the son of a bitch you are.

01:21:19.185 --> 01:21:22.018
The dog has been cured!
Do you understand me?

01:21:22.122 --> 01:21:25.614
The dog has been cured!
Cured by a black man.

01:21:49.783 --> 01:21:51.751
Come on, boy.

01:22:34.761 --> 01:22:38.720
You did it, Mr. Keys.

01:24:33.112 --> 01:24:36.172
Keys!

01:24:37.305 --> 01:24:43.253
