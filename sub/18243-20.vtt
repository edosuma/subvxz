11:39.220 --> 11:42.789
I mean, look at her.
She believes everything
he says.

11:42.876 --> 11:43.833
Right.

11:43.920 --> 11:45.487
And Kelly
seems to have gotten

11:45.574 --> 11:48.446
Mama P's need to win
at all costs.

11:48.533 --> 11:49.621
It's not a great trait
to pick up.

11:49.709 --> 11:50.927
What do we do?

11:51.014 --> 11:53.016
You keep an eye on
Mama P,

11:53.103 --> 11:55.018
and don't let her
buy anything from
that guy.

11:55.105 --> 11:57.499
I need to find Kelly
so we can break this spell.

11:59.196 --> 12:00.197
[sighs]

12:00.284 --> 12:03.200
♪♪[pop]

12:07.552 --> 12:11.121
Wow. You could get
four tops at the mall
for these prices.

12:11.208 --> 12:12.949
True, but they're
big on quality here,

12:13.036 --> 12:14.429
so these should
last longer.

12:17.606 --> 12:18.999
I can see that.

12:19.086 --> 12:20.391
Darby, what do you
think of this one?

12:20.478 --> 12:22.045
- I like it.
- I thought you might.

12:22.132 --> 12:23.699
- It's so you.
- You think?

12:23.786 --> 12:25.875
Yeah,
I'm not so sure.

12:25.962 --> 12:28.008
Totally.
Yellow is your color.

12:28.095 --> 12:31.011
Remember when I let you
borrow that gold top
with the hearts on it?

12:31.098 --> 12:33.796
Oh, yeah,
I did look cute.
I'll try this on.

12:33.883 --> 12:35.798
What about this one?

12:35.885 --> 12:38.758
It's-- It's great.
I'll try it on, too.

12:44.981 --> 12:47.027
That's why our dryers
didn't work?

12:47.114 --> 12:50.117
Yeah. But we could
replace those pipes
for you, no problem.

12:50.204 --> 12:52.293
I'll even give you
the friends and family
discount.

12:52.380 --> 12:54.904
Did you hear that, Jake?
He's gonna give us a deal.

12:54.991 --> 12:56.819
That's it.

12:56.906 --> 12:59.387
I can't sit here
and let you take
advantage of her.

12:59.474 --> 13:01.824
There's no way we'll
buy more defective junk
from you.

13:01.911 --> 13:04.479
- Whoa.
- If you don't replace the
hand dryers right away,

13:04.566 --> 13:06.089
I'll report you to
the Better Business Bureau,

13:06.176 --> 13:09.223
and I'll give you
a negative review online.

13:09.310 --> 13:10.702
Jake.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.139
I think we should
listen to him.

13:12.226 --> 13:13.967
He is, after all,
an expert.

13:14.054 --> 13:16.099
An expert at selling us
dud equipment.

13:16.186 --> 13:18.406
You have one week
to make it right.

13:18.493 --> 13:19.624
Or pay the price.

13:24.194 --> 13:25.805
Fine,
I'll replace them.

13:31.462 --> 13:33.203
[bell jingles]

13:33.290 --> 13:35.597
Jake. That was...

13:35.684 --> 13:36.641
rude.

13:37.686 --> 13:39.122
A wise woman
once told me

13:39.209 --> 13:41.603
not to ever let anyone
take advantage of me.

13:41.690 --> 13:43.170
Especially not
in business.

13:47.304 --> 13:48.566
Not today, Lever.

13:48.653 --> 13:50.090
More like loser.

13:50.177 --> 13:51.961

- [chuckling]

13:52.048 --> 13:54.659
What a coincidence.

13:54.746 --> 13:57.837
I was just out on one of
my centering walks,

13:57.924 --> 13:59.882
and the universe,
as it always does,

13:59.969 --> 14:01.405
has handed me
a gift.

14:01.492 --> 14:04.626
That Zen nonsense
won't work on me.

14:04.713 --> 14:06.541
You've heard of karma,
right?

14:06.628 --> 14:10.284
What you put out
always comes back to you.

14:10.371 --> 14:13.330
What's it gonna take
for you to delete the photo?

14:13.417 --> 14:15.855
I want my rosemary back.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.944
I might be able to
help with that.

14:18.031 --> 14:19.554
And that's not all.

14:19.641 --> 14:22.035
See, I know about
Mama P's pantry.

14:23.601 --> 14:24.820
And I want more.

14:27.475 --> 14:29.390
I'll give you 'til
the end of the day,

14:29.477 --> 14:32.219
and if not, I may have to
check in with my friend

14:32.306 --> 14:34.134
down at the
Saffron Falls Herald.

14:35.787 --> 14:37.485
Namaste,Kelly.

14:42.577 --> 14:45.841
Namaste,Noelle.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.846
Kelly.

14:50.933 --> 14:53.370
Wait until you hear
what I found out today.

14:53.457 --> 14:54.763
I went to Red's,
the restaurant where

14:54.850 --> 14:56.373
Noelle used to be
a line cook.

14:56.460 --> 14:58.767
Turns out she was fired.
[chuckles]

14:58.854 --> 15:00.377
You'd be amazed
what you can find out

15:00.464 --> 15:02.031
if you leave
a big enough tip.

15:02.118 --> 15:03.903
Wait,
you bribed someone?

15:03.990 --> 15:05.382
Okay, you are
definitely spelled.

15:05.469 --> 15:07.689
[sighs] That's just
simply not true.

15:07.776 --> 15:09.821
You're rolling your eyes,
you're being sneaky.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.649
By the way,
I love your shirt today,
it's so cute.

15:11.736 --> 15:14.826
Not to mention charming.
Thank you.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.916
Now, who does that
sound like to you?

15:17.003 --> 15:19.005
Someone awesome,
that's who.

15:19.092 --> 15:21.355
You could add confidence,
another Mama P trait.

15:21.442 --> 15:22.573
[chuckles]

15:22.660 --> 15:23.835
We need to
break this spell,

15:23.923 --> 15:25.446
but I have no idea
how to do that

15:25.533 --> 15:28.188
since the riddle
was smudged.

15:28.275 --> 15:30.755
Kelly.

15:30.842 --> 15:34.107
What's this I hear
about you covering up
Lever's signs?

15:34.194 --> 15:35.412
Noelle told you?

15:35.499 --> 15:37.110
That's it.
Deal's off.

15:37.197 --> 15:39.025
Mrs. Lee down the block
told me,

15:39.112 --> 15:40.591
and it doesn't matter
who told me.

15:40.678 --> 15:42.419
What were you thinking?

15:45.074 --> 15:46.989
And why didn't I
think of it?

15:47.076 --> 15:49.731
Wait, did I really
tamper with Lever's signs?

15:49.818 --> 15:52.255
You finally understand
what it truly means

15:52.342 --> 15:53.909
to be a politician's
daughter.

15:53.996 --> 15:56.738
Mrs. Quinn,
are you okay?

15:56.825 --> 15:59.741
Covering his signs?
Genius.

15:59.828 --> 16:01.221
So you're not mad?

16:01.308 --> 16:03.092
[scoffs]
Not at all.

16:03.179 --> 16:04.964
In fact,
I feel confident

16:05.051 --> 16:06.966
for the first time
in a while.

16:07.053 --> 16:09.229
I think I can actually
win this election.

16:09.316 --> 16:11.492
Mom, could you excuse us
for a minute.

16:18.194 --> 16:19.282
Did you see that?

16:19.369 --> 16:21.502
The spell passed
from me to Mom.

16:21.589 --> 16:23.199
What exactly is this spell?

16:23.286 --> 16:24.853
Well, we tried to
extract the magic,

16:24.940 --> 16:27.725
but instead we extracted
the "magic" of Mama P.

16:27.812 --> 16:31.120
You mean, we took out
what makes Mama P Mama P?

16:31.207 --> 16:34.558
Yes, and based on your mom's
sudden change of heart,

16:34.645 --> 16:36.256
it passes by touch.

16:36.343 --> 16:38.562
Right. Mama P
touched me on the shoulder

16:38.649 --> 16:40.347
after she insulted
the mac 'n cheese.

16:40.434 --> 16:41.609
We need to get it back

16:41.696 --> 16:43.437
before your mom
does something drastic.

16:46.048 --> 16:47.876
Oh.

16:47.963 --> 16:49.965
I think I'll wear this
to the debate.

16:50.052 --> 16:52.837
Pretty.
Mom, can I have a hug?

16:52.924 --> 16:54.230
What's your angle?

16:54.317 --> 16:55.623
Why do I need an angle
to hug my mom?

17:05.633 --> 17:07.026
Okay, I don't know
what just got into me,

17:07.113 --> 17:08.810
but you're in
big trouble, Kelly.

17:08.896 --> 17:10.855
You're so right, Mom.

17:10.942 --> 17:13.249
I guess I just let
the excitement of
the campaign

17:13.336 --> 17:15.382
overtake me.
I'm sorry.

17:15.469 --> 17:16.644
I thought
you understood

17:16.731 --> 17:18.689
that we are under
a microscope.

17:18.776 --> 17:20.213
You can't do things
like that.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.954
Now, go and take down
those signs.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.042
Of course.

17:29.004 --> 17:30.745
We need to
un-spell you now.

17:30.832 --> 17:33.226
Or we could infiltrate
Lever's headquarters

17:33.313 --> 17:35.315
under the guise of
campaign volunteers,

17:35.402 --> 17:37.056
then we can sneak into
the records room and we--

17:37.143 --> 17:38.057
Hey!

17:42.148 --> 17:44.280
Sorry, but
you can't be trusted

17:44.367 --> 17:47.066
to take this back
to Mama P's.

17:47.153 --> 17:50.286
And it turns out,
neither can I.

17:52.767 --> 17:54.899
[door opens, closes]

17:58.033 --> 17:59.339
I love it.

18:00.992 --> 18:02.472
Yes,
it's very nice.

18:08.609 --> 18:10.350
Oh, that's great.

18:12.265 --> 18:14.484
It's definitely...

18:14.571 --> 18:15.572
unique?

18:23.189 --> 18:24.146
Simple, at least.

18:24.233 --> 18:25.539
Can I have it?

18:28.759 --> 18:31.806
Sorry.
It's a fortune.

18:31.893 --> 18:33.329
Here, let me buy it
for Darby.

18:33.416 --> 18:35.114
Wow, really?

18:35.201 --> 18:38.378
You don't have to do that.
It's very expensive.

18:38.465 --> 18:40.206
And she'll get tired of it
in ten minutes.

18:40.293 --> 18:42.208
I know,
but it's my pleasure.

18:42.295 --> 18:44.514
- Really.
- Thanks, Amy.

18:46.081 --> 18:47.778
[sighs] It's very
thoughtful of you.

18:59.703 --> 19:01.705
Ah, there you are.

19:01.792 --> 19:03.751
I can't let you
do this.

19:03.838 --> 19:05.274
Don't tell
the Crosby anecdote.

19:05.361 --> 19:06.710
It makes you look
too mean.

19:06.797 --> 19:08.277
And definitely
don't mention that

19:08.364 --> 19:09.800
you couldn't play
in public.

19:09.887 --> 19:11.672
Try explaining that.

19:11.759 --> 19:14.153
And nobody
wants to hear about
your leaky roof.

19:14.240 --> 19:18.505
I'm already nervous
and this little pop in
didn't help.

19:18.592 --> 19:22.639
All you have to do is
be charming, confident,
and passionate.

19:22.726 --> 19:25.033
I can't be
any of those things.

19:25.120 --> 19:28.167
No, you can't.
But Mama P can.

19:28.254 --> 19:30.038
What's she got to do
with this?

19:36.262 --> 19:38.568
Man: Miss Silvers?
Come on in.

19:41.789 --> 19:45.836
So, what made you want to
make the transition

19:45.923 --> 19:47.403
from teaching students
one-on-one

19:47.490 --> 19:49.275
to the classroom?

19:49.362 --> 19:51.668
Great question.

19:51.755 --> 19:54.410
I played Carnegie Hall,

19:54.497 --> 19:58.240
but it's nothing compared to
watching a student

19:58.327 --> 20:01.112
be inspired by
a piece of music.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.550
It's what gets me up
in the morning.

20:03.637 --> 20:06.248
I can make
a bigger difference
at this school,

20:06.335 --> 20:09.425
and reach more students.

20:09.512 --> 20:11.862
Oh. I'm sorry,
I can't go another minute

20:11.949 --> 20:16.171
without saying what
a beautiful family
you have.

20:16.258 --> 20:18.347
Thank you.

20:18.434 --> 20:20.001
They're my world.

20:20.088 --> 20:22.569
That's how I feel
about my students.

20:22.656 --> 20:24.919
I think of them as family.

20:25.006 --> 20:29.576
And we all want the best
for our family, right?

20:29.663 --> 20:32.143
So true.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.842
I have one more question.

20:34.929 --> 20:36.626
How soon can you start?

20:40.282 --> 20:43.024
- You got it?
- I did.

20:43.111 --> 20:44.721
And negotiated
a higher salary.

20:44.808 --> 20:46.157
That's amazing.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.725
Congrats, Miss Silvers.
I knew you could do it.

20:48.812 --> 20:50.771
Oh, you did, did you?

20:50.858 --> 20:53.469
Yeah. You just needed
the confidence.

20:53.556 --> 20:55.732
Is that what spell
I'm under?

20:55.819 --> 20:59.519
Confidence cookies?
Smooth Talker Tapenade?

20:59.606 --> 21:03.262
We cooked an
extract the magic spell
to cure Mama P,

21:03.349 --> 21:06.134
but we accidentally
extracted her personality.

21:06.221 --> 21:07.657
And also,
it's contagious.

21:07.744 --> 21:09.877
And I gave it to you.

21:09.964 --> 21:11.966
Well done.

21:12.053 --> 21:14.011
I could have told you
extracting magic

21:14.098 --> 21:15.926
would result in
contagion.

21:16.013 --> 21:17.232
Don't you think
over the years

21:17.319 --> 21:19.278
we tried
every kind of spell

21:19.365 --> 21:21.367
to break our curses?

21:21.454 --> 21:23.891
I guess we didn't
think of that.

21:23.978 --> 21:27.460
But extracting the magic
shouldn't have resulted in

21:27.547 --> 21:30.724
extracting
her personality.

21:30.811 --> 21:33.770
Oh, the forget magic spell
must be truly powerful

21:33.857 --> 21:35.294
to have caused this.

21:35.381 --> 21:36.947
But how do we break
the contagion?

21:37.034 --> 21:38.166
The riddle was smudged.

21:38.253 --> 21:40.255
The only way
to break the spell

21:40.342 --> 21:42.779
is to bring it back
to patient zero

21:42.866 --> 21:44.215
Mama P.

21:47.218 --> 21:48.350
I love this one.

21:48.437 --> 21:50.265
Nope.

21:50.352 --> 21:53.094
Yeah,
I agree with your mom.
It's a little too...

21:53.181 --> 21:54.356
- Grown up.
- Yeah.

21:54.443 --> 21:56.358
But Piper has
these exact boots,

21:56.445 --> 21:58.099
and he jacket
will keep me warm
in the theater.

21:58.186 --> 22:00.275
So will a Rockbury
sweatshirt.

22:00.362 --> 22:01.320
Nice try, Darby.

22:02.843 --> 22:04.279
I remember that one.

22:04.366 --> 22:05.976
My friend has
these boots.

22:06.063 --> 22:07.978
I used it on my mom
all the time.

22:08.065 --> 22:10.154
Do you remember the
"If I don't get these
Doc Martens,

22:10.241 --> 22:12.896
"Ill be the only girl
in the whole school
without them."

22:12.983 --> 22:14.637
Yes.
[chuckles]

22:14.724 --> 22:16.987
So, does that mean
I can get the outfit
or--

22:17.074 --> 22:18.511
No, sweetie.

22:18.598 --> 22:19.816
Listen to your mom,
Darbs.

22:19.903 --> 22:21.644
Don't be in a hurry
to grow up.

22:23.298 --> 22:24.647
Still want the boots.

22:26.693 --> 22:29.696
[chuckles]

22:29.783 --> 22:31.611
You know,
I should go.

22:31.698 --> 22:32.916
Why?

22:33.003 --> 22:34.091
This is your thing
with Darby.

22:34.178 --> 22:36.964
I shouldn't be here.

22:37.051 --> 22:39.314
I won't lie.
It's been a little awkward.

22:39.401 --> 22:42.448
- So awkward.
- [laughs]

22:42.535 --> 22:44.232
But you're in
Patrick's life,

22:44.319 --> 22:47.278
and that means
you're in Darby's life.

22:47.366 --> 22:48.932
I want us to be
on good terms.

22:49.019 --> 22:51.195
I want that, too.

22:51.282 --> 22:53.284
Thanks for being
so nice to Darby.

22:53.372 --> 22:54.895
She really
looks up to you.

22:54.982 --> 22:57.419
It's easy. You did
a great job with her.

22:57.506 --> 22:59.116
She's an amazing kid.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.599
Since I'm so amazing,
boots?

23:03.686 --> 23:04.600
Still no.

23:08.430 --> 23:10.127
So I marched
right up to him,

23:10.214 --> 23:13.304
and then I told him
he'd better give us
new hand dryers,

23:13.392 --> 23:14.610
or else.

23:14.697 --> 23:16.873
Wow. You really
channeled Mama P.

23:16.960 --> 23:18.571
And you weren't
even spelled.

23:18.658 --> 23:20.442
I'm exhausted.
I don't know how
Mama P

23:20.529 --> 23:22.139
- does it all the time.
- Hey, guys.

23:22.226 --> 23:23.489
Please tell me
you didn't do anything

23:23.576 --> 23:25.229
while you were
under the spell.

23:25.316 --> 23:28.363
Someone needed
a little charm
and confidence,

23:28.450 --> 23:30.539
so I made
a quick stop.

23:30.626 --> 23:33.847
Mama P's not
all bad, Kell.

23:33.934 --> 23:35.805
Ahh. Ida.

23:37.894 --> 23:39.418
Gina.

23:39.505 --> 23:42.551
I will deny it if
you ever tell anyone
I said this,

23:42.638 --> 23:46.120
but you have
your moments.

23:46.207 --> 23:48.862
Thank you for
your help today.

23:48.949 --> 23:50.646
Thanks,
but how did I help?

23:57.087 --> 23:59.916
Did I almost buy more junk
from that crook of a sales guy?

24:00.003 --> 24:01.570
Don't worry,
Mama P.

24:01.657 --> 24:03.746
I had your back.

24:03.833 --> 24:05.879
Well,
I have to get home.

24:05.966 --> 24:09.099
I have lessons to prepare
for my new job.

24:09.186 --> 24:11.014
[mouthing]

24:12.015 --> 24:13.452
So. what do we do now?

24:13.539 --> 24:15.802
Mama P still doesn't
remember magic.

24:15.889 --> 24:17.804
And I may have
told Noelle

24:17.891 --> 24:19.501
she could have
her rosemary back.

24:19.588 --> 24:20.894
You what?

24:20.981 --> 24:23.244
She took pictures of me
covering up the signs.

24:23.331 --> 24:25.159
I didn't know
what to do.

24:25.246 --> 24:28.205
Also,
she somehow knows about
the secret spice pantry.

24:28.292 --> 24:30.904
Whoa.
That's a lot of no good.

24:30.991 --> 24:33.123
Look, I'll tell her
we're not giving her
the spices,

24:33.210 --> 24:36.213
even if I have to
take responsibility
for my actions.

24:36.300 --> 24:37.867
But you fixed
the signs.

24:37.954 --> 24:40.740
The photo could still hurt
my mom's campaign.

24:42.132 --> 24:43.090
There's Noelle.

24:45.571 --> 24:47.660
Noelle.

24:47.747 --> 24:49.052
Hello, Kelly.

24:49.139 --> 24:50.619
I'm not giving you
the spices,

24:50.706 --> 24:52.578
so do what you
have to do.

24:52.665 --> 24:54.710
What are you
talking about?

24:54.797 --> 24:56.973
You took photos of me and
were going to blackmail me

24:57.060 --> 24:58.453
in exchange for
the magic spices.

25:00.194 --> 25:02.239
Magic.

25:02.326 --> 25:05.504
Okay, I'm not sure
what kind of game
you kids are playing,

25:05.591 --> 25:06.548
but I'm busy.

25:06.635 --> 25:08.681
And you know what?

25:08.768 --> 25:12.467
I didn't appreciate
you running out in
the middle of a shift.

25:12.554 --> 25:14.338
Right, I, uh,

25:14.425 --> 25:16.471
just decided to stay
at Mama P's.

25:18.865 --> 25:20.867
Well, I guess you're not
the girl I thought you were.

25:26.307 --> 25:28.135
She didn't remember
blackmailing you.

25:28.222 --> 25:29.571
Which means...

25:29.658 --> 25:32.226
Someone hit Noelle with
a forget magic spell.

25:32.313 --> 25:33.967
But that doesn't
make sense.

25:34.054 --> 25:36.839
I thought she was the one
who attacked RJ and Mama P.

25:36.926 --> 25:38.754
Clearly,
we were wrong.

25:38.841 --> 25:40.495
It wasn't her.

25:40.582 --> 25:42.541
If Noelle didn't do it,
then...

25:42.628 --> 25:44.499
we're out of suspects.
