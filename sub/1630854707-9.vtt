WEBVTT

00:23.120 --> 00:26.440
So what are we doing, Milo?

00:26.640 --> 00:29.740
You have something I want.

00:29.940 --> 00:32.650
And I have something you want.

00:32.850 --> 00:35.380
I still don't know
what we're talking about.

00:35.580 --> 00:40.150
I hear my bonds have found
their way into police custody.

00:40.350 --> 00:44.590
If the KPD have my paper,
then you can get it for me.

00:44.790 --> 00:46.690
What's in it for me?

00:46.890 --> 00:49.930
Your girl.

00:50.130 --> 00:53.630
Well, technically
my girl, but...

00:53.830 --> 00:59.040
I'll sell her to you
for $14 million.

00:59.240 --> 01:03.010
You get the bonds and
get the fuck out of town.

01:03.210 --> 01:05.340
Nobody wants to be here.

01:05.540 --> 01:07.710
I stay for the money.

01:07.910 --> 01:11.780
I know you found it for me.

01:11.980 --> 01:13.720
You should leave too, Mike.

01:13.920 --> 01:15.590
You should get out of Kingstown.

01:15.790 --> 01:17.560
Take the girl.

01:17.760 --> 01:21.160
Don't take the girl.
That part is of no consequence.

01:21.360 --> 01:24.030
You get my paper.
I'll get your Iris.

01:24.230 --> 01:27.800
But if you have ideas of...

01:28.000 --> 01:31.870
other arrangements
or I'm betrayed by you,

01:32.070 --> 01:34.740
I won't just kill you, Mike.

01:34.940 --> 01:36.530
Know that.

01:40.760 --> 01:42.600
Someone will be in touch.

01:51.440 --> 01:54.480
[traffic]

01:56.650 --> 01:58.550
[doorbell rings]

02:00.720 --> 02:01.730
Hey, what's good?

02:01.930 --> 02:04.090
Hey, Dad!

02:04.920 --> 02:06.510
Don't open for 15, big man.

02:06.710 --> 02:09.880
Oh, I'm sorry, my bad.
Uh, I'll come back later?

02:10.080 --> 02:11.510
No sweat, pal.
Come on in and look around.

02:11.710 --> 02:12.680
I'll be right with you.

02:12.880 --> 02:14.500
Thank you, sir.
Appreciate that.

02:20.700 --> 02:22.240
Mm.

02:24.210 --> 02:25.670
What are you looking for?

02:26.940 --> 02:27.960
That's a pretty-looking Sig.

02:28.160 --> 02:29.630
[Shopkeeper chuckles]

02:29.830 --> 02:31.310
Yeah.

02:37.050 --> 02:39.770
That's 799 plus tax.

02:39.970 --> 02:41.410
799?

02:41.610 --> 02:43.480
It's a .10 millimeter.

02:43.680 --> 02:45.040
Hm.

02:45.240 --> 02:49.000
- You mind if I take a look?
- No, please, handle it.

02:50.770 --> 02:52.950
Fill out the paper now,
I'll call in your ID,

02:53.150 --> 02:55.290
get you cleared.

02:55.490 --> 02:56.860
And you're walking
out of here with it

02:57.060 --> 02:58.640
before we're officially open.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.980
Boy, it's pretty.

03:08.380 --> 03:09.870
I'mma call my wife and check.

03:10.070 --> 03:11.300
You know how it is, right?

03:11.500 --> 03:13.910
I do, I do, I do.

03:14.110 --> 03:15.420
Let's see.

03:19.630 --> 03:22.320
[line trilling]

03:22.520 --> 03:23.270
Hey, baby.

03:25.570 --> 03:28.790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm looking at it right now.

03:28.990 --> 03:30.460
Uh-huh.

03:30.660 --> 03:33.030
Yeah.

03:33.230 --> 03:35.730
It's beautiful.

03:35.930 --> 03:38.050
Baby, it's real beautiful.

03:40.850 --> 03:41.970
Hands up, motherfucker.

03:42.170 --> 03:45.070
[alarm ringing]

03:45.270 --> 03:47.940
Not a fuckin' muscle,
big fella, all right?

03:48.140 --> 03:49.340
Chill. You too.

03:49.540 --> 03:52.110
This shit ain't worth
dying over, okay?

03:52.310 --> 03:53.760
Now, pieces on the counter.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.750
Two fingers. Two fingers.

03:56.950 --> 03:58.020
All right, side holsters,

03:58.220 --> 03:59.050
and whatever you're
rockin' on your ankles.

03:59.250 --> 04:00.920
You too! You too!

04:01.120 --> 04:02.640
Got it.

04:03.740 --> 04:05.070
All right.

04:10.810 --> 04:12.330
You get that shit.

04:12.530 --> 04:14.080
Get it.

04:15.220 --> 04:19.320
[alarm ringing]

04:25.330 --> 04:27.130
[Bunny] 799 my ass!

04:28.030 --> 04:29.010
[police siren wailing]

04:29.210 --> 04:31.150
Come on, let's go!

04:31.350 --> 04:35.370
[police siren wailing]
[alarm ringing]

04:45.210 --> 04:47.350
All right, we got enough.
Let's go.

04:50.820 --> 04:52.420
We got it!

04:53.060 --> 04:54.520
Let's roll, baby.

04:55.360 --> 04:57.590
[tires screeching]

04:59.090 --> 05:05.230
[theme music]

06:02.760 --> 06:08.600
[morose music]

06:23.180 --> 06:25.950
[sighs]

06:34.790 --> 06:37.360
I'll meet you there.
Yeah, how about that?

06:38.130 --> 06:39.800
Look...
[door opens]

06:40.700 --> 06:41.960
Hold on a second.

06:44.800 --> 06:46.280
Holy shit.

06:46.490 --> 06:49.350
Uh, Trace, let me call you--
I'll call you back, okay?

06:49.560 --> 06:51.490
I gotta go.
Mike just walked in.

06:51.690 --> 06:53.890
I love you. All right.
Fuck.

06:54.090 --> 06:55.090
Hey!

06:55.290 --> 06:57.130
- [Mike] Hey.
- Hey, what the fuck?

06:57.330 --> 06:59.600
- [Mike] How are ya doin'?
- Oh my god, come here.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.900
Oh, shit.

07:02.100 --> 07:05.470
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.

07:05.670 --> 07:08.840
- I'm here.
- Fuck, Mike.

07:09.040 --> 07:10.510
Everybody was lookin' for ya.

07:10.710 --> 07:11.540
Jesus.

07:11.740 --> 07:13.460
I gotta call off
the search party.

07:14.560 --> 07:16.650
Yeah.

07:16.850 --> 07:18.050
[sighs]

07:18.250 --> 07:19.640
[chuckles]

07:20.370 --> 07:22.860
I saw Milo.

07:23.060 --> 07:24.820
No shit.

07:25.020 --> 07:26.220
We made a deal.

07:26.420 --> 07:29.160
Whoa, what--
Ok-Okay.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.760
He's got Iris.

07:31.960 --> 07:33.900
Yeah, I know.

07:34.100 --> 07:35.100
What do you mean you know?

07:35.300 --> 07:36.970
I saw her, Mike.
I called you.

07:37.170 --> 07:38.140
Where did you fuckin' see her?

07:38.340 --> 07:39.540
- At the club.
- What the fuck?

07:39.740 --> 07:41.610
What are you doing
at the club, Kyle?

07:41.810 --> 07:44.380
Lookin' for Milo.
I left you a message.

07:44.580 --> 07:46.140
- [sighs]
- What!?

07:46.340 --> 07:47.410
[Mike] What the fuck
did I tell you?

07:47.610 --> 07:49.550
Don't go around
fucking being a hero.

07:49.750 --> 07:51.280
- Aw, fuck--
- You can't be

07:51.480 --> 07:53.750
walkin' into that fuckin' place,
lookin' for fuckin' Milo.

07:53.950 --> 07:55.020
Hold on a second!

07:55.220 --> 07:56.690
I don't know how
this became about me,

07:56.890 --> 07:58.460
because I'm pretty sure
you're the one who disappeared,

07:58.660 --> 08:00.130
and now you're
walkin' in here saying

08:00.330 --> 08:02.730
- you made a deal with Milo?
- Yeah, I did.

08:02.930 --> 08:05.610
You gonna tell me what
the fucking deal is or what?

08:06.550 --> 08:08.330
It's the bonds for Iris.
Simple.

08:08.530 --> 08:15.240
[sinister music]

08:15.440 --> 08:17.490
Fuck. Oh...

08:21.030 --> 08:24.630
[Mike] I just want this
motherfucker out of town.

08:25.670 --> 08:28.800
I want him the fuck
out of our lives.

08:32.210 --> 08:33.840
What is she to you, Mike?

08:35.180 --> 08:37.780
I don't know.

08:38.550 --> 08:41.600
I want her to get away.

08:41.800 --> 08:43.400
I know that.

08:43.600 --> 08:46.940
Away from Milo.

08:47.140 --> 08:48.920
Away from this fucking town.

08:52.090 --> 08:53.830
That's what I want.

08:54.900 --> 08:57.730
Okay.

08:59.500 --> 09:01.400
Then let's fuckin' do it.

09:02.470 --> 09:04.640
Yeah. [sighs]

09:10.550 --> 09:12.160
Did you call Ma?

09:12.360 --> 09:13.300
I just got the phone.

09:13.500 --> 09:14.630
[Kyle] Right, call her.

09:14.830 --> 09:16.330
I mean, everybody was
lookin' for you, Mike.

09:16.530 --> 09:18.140
Everybody was worried.

09:18.340 --> 09:19.870
You know, and I had
Bunny making sure

09:20.070 --> 09:22.370
that nobody put a dot
on you from the inside.

09:22.570 --> 09:25.310
Gotta get fucking Bunny out.

09:25.510 --> 09:27.130
He's out, Mike.

09:29.430 --> 09:33.390
[line trilling]

09:33.590 --> 09:35.090
[Mariam] <i>Michael,</i>
<i>are you all right?</i>

09:35.290 --> 09:36.890
Yep. All good.

09:37.090 --> 09:40.330
Oh, I just called and called.
I'm so glad you're okay.

09:40.530 --> 09:41.790
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.

09:41.990 --> 09:43.660
[Mariam] <i>Do you remember</i>
<i>the boy I told you about?</i>

09:43.860 --> 09:45.030
Yup.

09:45.230 --> 09:46.770
They weren't gonna move him
for a few days, they said.

09:46.970 --> 09:49.070
And then all of a sudden,
they just moved him.

09:49.270 --> 09:50.870
Well, sometimes
that happens, Mom.

09:51.070 --> 09:54.470
Honey, if you're able,
he really needs your help.

09:54.670 --> 09:55.510
All right, I'll try.

09:55.710 --> 09:58.480
His name is Jacob Reed.

09:58.680 --> 10:00.150
Jacob Reed. I got it.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.720
[Mariam] <i>I'm so</i>
<i>glad you're okay.</i>

10:02.920 --> 10:04.170
Thank you, Mom.

[Kareem] <i>Starting to like</i>
<i>the radio silence, Mike.</i>

10:10.920 --> 10:11.860
Yeah, me too.

10:12.060 --> 10:13.490
You calling to gloat
about Bunny getting out?

10:13.690 --> 10:14.660
What happened there?

10:14.860 --> 10:16.290
It came from the DA's office.

10:16.490 --> 10:18.130
I figured that meant
it came from you.

10:18.330 --> 10:19.830
He just walked out, huh?

10:20.030 --> 10:21.100
[Kareem] <i>Yeah,</i>
<i>he just walked out,</i>

10:21.300 --> 10:22.430
<i>just like you planned.</i>

10:22.630 --> 10:24.070
<i>Well, Mexican's dead.</i>

10:24.270 --> 10:26.910
<i>Looks like all you have left</i>
<i>is the Blood and the AB boss,</i>

10:27.110 --> 10:30.380
and then your
experiment is finished.

10:30.580 --> 10:31.580
Was it worth it?

10:31.780 --> 10:33.080
[Mike] <i>Well, I don't know yet.</i>

10:33.280 --> 10:34.880
Hey listen, man, I need a favor.

10:35.080 --> 10:37.620
It's, uh...It's not
really our relationship.

10:37.820 --> 10:39.050
[Mike] <i>I know, I hate to ask.</i>

10:39.250 --> 10:40.720
But, uh, it's important.

10:40.920 --> 10:44.820
There's this kid,
Jacob Reed, over at Anchor.

10:45.020 --> 10:49.530
He's 18, juvie, getting
transferred to gen pop today.

10:49.730 --> 10:50.860
Uh, he's getting
a lot of AB pressure,

10:51.060 --> 10:52.500

10:55.200 --> 10:56.570
And who's this kid to you?

10:56.770 --> 10:58.650
It's a favor for my mom.

11:00.790 --> 11:02.310
Okay, I'll try to find him.

11:02.510 --> 11:03.410
[Mike] <i>Appreciate it.</i>

11:03.610 --> 11:04.840
Thanks!
[beep]

11:05.040 --> 11:06.710
Fuck. What?

11:06.910 --> 11:08.250
[phone rings]
Mikey, listen.

11:08.450 --> 11:11.320
I need you to get to the fucking
gun shop on Bonner, all right?

11:11.520 --> 11:12.620
You're gonna wanna see this.

11:12.820 --> 11:14.350
Well, am I really, though, Ian?

11:14.550 --> 11:16.220
Every time I'm gonna
wanna see this,

11:16.420 --> 11:18.220
I get fucking blood on my shoes.

11:18.420 --> 11:20.360
Listen to me,
there's no blood yet,

11:20.560 --> 11:21.910
<i>but there's about to be.</i>

[police radio chatter]

11:40.000 --> 11:41.980
[Ian] Where ya been?

11:42.180 --> 11:44.650
Taking a me day.

11:44.850 --> 11:47.850
[Ian] These fuckers,
they scored an arsenal here.

11:48.050 --> 11:49.090
They cleaned out the whole shop.

11:49.290 --> 11:50.020
I wouldn't have
fuckin' called you,

11:50.220 --> 11:52.490
honest to god, but...

11:52.690 --> 11:54.630
the shopkeeper says
it's a 300-pound,

11:54.830 --> 11:57.100
6'4, charismatic motherfucker.

11:57.300 --> 11:58.760
Now, does that sound
like anybody you know?

11:58.960 --> 12:00.620
Yeah.

12:01.420 --> 12:03.090
Jesus.

12:04.150 --> 12:05.440
What about surveillance?

12:05.640 --> 12:06.940
Trashed it.

12:07.140 --> 12:09.840
I didn't even know
Bunny was out.

12:10.040 --> 12:12.640
I know he's your guy...

12:12.850 --> 12:14.880
but we will grind him
into the fucking ground,

12:15.080 --> 12:16.480
deal or no deal.
I don't give a shit.

12:16.680 --> 12:19.820
If they try us, we will
grind them into the dirt.

12:20.020 --> 12:21.590
Yeah, let me talk
to him, all right?

12:21.790 --> 12:23.120
You can't handle shit
on the street, Mike.

12:23.320 --> 12:24.620
Yeah, no shit, right?

12:24.820 --> 12:26.190
[Ian] He's gearing up
for a fucking war here.

12:26.390 --> 12:27.760
You gotta listen to me.

12:27.960 --> 12:30.360
A goddamn war.

12:30.560 --> 12:32.460
Yeah, look, I'll-I'll
talk to him, all right?

12:32.660 --> 12:34.100
[Ian] Mike, you're
not hearing me.

12:34.300 --> 12:35.930
We should be fucking
picking him up right now.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.600
Yeah, like I said,
let me handle it, okay?

12:37.800 --> 12:41.310
Just fucking relax.

12:41.510 --> 12:43.240
We got to deescalate this shit.
All right?

12:43.440 --> 12:45.180
We got enough on our plate
with Robert and the DA,

12:45.380 --> 12:46.510
and a whole laundry list
of things--

12:46.710 --> 12:48.450
Robert thing--
Robert thing went away.

12:48.650 --> 12:49.400
Went away.

12:51.430 --> 12:52.890
- What do you mean it went away?
- It went away!

12:53.090 --> 12:54.250
The fucking DA dumped it.
I don't know.

12:54.450 --> 12:57.360
Maybe you got through to
Morrissey, I don't know.

12:57.560 --> 12:59.060
It's gone.

12:59.260 --> 13:01.810
You fucking kidding me?

13:03.610 --> 13:04.830
Sometimes you just
leave shit alone

13:05.030 --> 13:06.460
it'll go away on its own.

13:06.660 --> 13:08.930
Napoleon used to not answer his
fucking letters for two weeks.

13:09.130 --> 13:10.840
You know that?

13:11.040 --> 13:12.040
- What?
- True story.

13:12.240 --> 13:13.340
At war, on the front,

13:13.540 --> 13:14.870
wouldn't answer his
letters for two weeks.

13:15.070 --> 13:17.110
He figured if it was still
important enough to be a thing

13:17.310 --> 13:19.790
after two weeks,
he'd deal with it.

13:22.460 --> 13:26.180
- I don't got two weeks.
- You're not an emperor.

13:26.380 --> 13:28.350
Well, you're an asshole,
wasting my fucking time--

13:28.550 --> 13:29.520
- Hey--
- Jesus Christ, man.

13:29.720 --> 13:31.820
Thank you for
picking up the phone.

13:32.020 --> 13:33.580
Yeah, sure thing.

13:36.850 --> 13:43.540
[unsettling music]

13:43.740 --> 13:45.250
[elevator dings]

13:55.330 --> 13:56.880
- Hey.
- [Evelyn] Not now, Mike.

13:57.080 --> 14:00.790
- I called your office.
- Jesus Christ.

14:00.990 --> 14:02.470
- All right?
- Follow me.

14:05.870 --> 14:07.840
- I tried calling you.
- Yeah, you look like hell.

14:09.010 --> 14:10.700
- Okay.
- Have you slept?

14:10.900 --> 14:14.330
I'll sleep when this is over.
[chuckles]

14:14.530 --> 14:16.550
- What do you want, Mike?
- I want to thank you.

14:17.750 --> 14:21.440
For Robert. For Bunny.

14:21.640 --> 14:24.140
I mean, we owe a couple more,
but Bunny's a good start.

14:24.340 --> 14:25.740
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

14:25.940 --> 14:26.980
[Evelyn] You think I did that?

14:27.180 --> 14:29.750
You think that after what
you did, after Lockett...

14:29.950 --> 14:32.780
You think I would--
that I could do anything

14:32.990 --> 14:36.490
to help you and the monsters
that you're in bed with?

14:36.690 --> 14:37.660
That wasn't me.

14:37.860 --> 14:39.090
That was your fucking
girlfriend at Warwick.

14:39.290 --> 14:41.560
I didn't have anything
to fucking do with that.

14:41.760 --> 14:44.430
If I am lucky enough
to get elected

14:44.630 --> 14:46.530
to fill the seat that
I am currently sitting in,

14:46.730 --> 14:49.230
I am gonna spend
my days and nights

14:49.430 --> 14:51.640
trying to stop you and yours

14:51.840 --> 14:54.620
from driving this town
into the fucking ground.

14:59.490 --> 15:02.210
Fuck, Mike, you talk
about restoring order.

15:02.410 --> 15:05.080
Your SWAT buddy
kills with impunity!

15:05.280 --> 15:08.120
And the one fucking guy
who calls him out

15:08.320 --> 15:11.120
is--surprise,
surprise--winds up dead

15:11.320 --> 15:13.190
before he can
testify against him.

15:13.390 --> 15:15.090
Who are you talking about?

15:15.290 --> 15:17.130
The inmates are running
the asylum, Mike,

15:17.330 --> 15:19.580
and you're the one
giving them the goddamn key.

15:22.780 --> 15:23.800
Get some rest, Mike.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.490
I feel like it's gonna be
a long fight ahead.

15:28.290 --> 15:34.360
[tense music]

15:53.720 --> 15:56.250
[drone whirring]

16:10.130 --> 16:11.630
You missed the party.

16:14.400 --> 16:17.040
- Welcome back.
- Yeah, yeah.

16:18.670 --> 16:20.510
[chuckles]

16:24.710 --> 16:27.530
So you're out less
than 24 hours,

16:27.730 --> 16:29.680
get yourself a new fuckin' toy.

16:30.590 --> 16:33.240
You clean out a gun shop
in the middle of the day?

16:33.440 --> 16:34.870
Is that right?

16:35.070 --> 16:36.640
Gotta protect my throne, Mike.

16:36.840 --> 16:38.690
You know, heavy lies
the crown and shit?

16:40.260 --> 16:41.900
- Bunny.
- Listen...

16:44.500 --> 16:47.450
I appreciate you keeping
your word and all.

16:47.650 --> 16:49.740
But dropping me back
into that world, Mike?

16:52.370 --> 16:54.940
A mu'fucka starts
to see some shit.

16:55.780 --> 16:59.060
Start getting clear about the
who's, the what's, the why's...

16:59.260 --> 17:01.300
You're talking in code, Bunny.

17:01.500 --> 17:03.600
Just say what you gotta say.

17:03.800 --> 17:05.840
I'm saying me and you,
we square, right?

17:06.040 --> 17:07.370
We good.

17:07.570 --> 17:09.740
But there's a toll
gotta be paid,

17:09.940 --> 17:11.240
still,

17:11.440 --> 17:14.610
for them brothers that
got done in them riots.

17:14.810 --> 17:16.750
Bunny...

17:16.950 --> 17:21.420
we talked about
this already, right?

17:21.620 --> 17:23.820
The riot, that
shit's in the past.

17:24.020 --> 17:24.820
Okay?

17:25.020 --> 17:26.560
Pickin' at scabs,

17:26.760 --> 17:28.360
it's only gonna prevent
the wound from healing.

17:28.560 --> 17:29.690
Ain't no healin', Mike.

17:29.890 --> 17:33.300
Them scar tissue gonna
be there no matter what.

17:33.500 --> 17:36.430
I'm lookin' for that
big game on my mantle.

17:36.630 --> 17:38.750
Yeah.
I want that wrecking ball, Mike.

17:41.090 --> 17:43.440
I want that SWAT mu'fucka.

17:43.640 --> 17:45.740
Jesus Christ, Bunny.

17:45.940 --> 17:47.980
That dude, he-he be givin'
innocent folks nightmares

17:48.180 --> 17:50.180
about them doors getting
kicked in for no reason, Mike.

17:50.380 --> 17:52.680
All right!
I understand that. I get it.

17:52.880 --> 17:53.920
But you can want that, right?

17:54.120 --> 17:55.320
Just want that!

17:55.520 --> 17:57.960
Don't fucking do it.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.260
Think about it!

17:59.460 --> 18:01.990
They'll scorch this
fucking place, Bunny!

18:02.190 --> 18:04.800
They'll turn your neighborhood
into a fucking parking lot.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.130
Them boys already
scorched it, Mike.

18:08.330 --> 18:11.970
Shit, that's how it is out here.

18:12.170 --> 18:13.270
If you gonna give, hey,

18:13.470 --> 18:16.840
you better be
prepared to get, baby.

18:17.040 --> 18:17.880
I can't let you do that.

18:18.080 --> 18:19.890
I ain't asking you
to let me do shit.

18:23.670 --> 18:25.850
[Mike] Bunny, if you want
to fucking reach for that,

18:26.050 --> 18:28.350
you're starting a fight
that you do not want,

18:28.550 --> 18:30.890
I promise you.

18:31.090 --> 18:34.640
And you think you know
what the fuck I want?

18:39.880 --> 18:41.750
Thought I did.

18:48.090 --> 18:55.430
[foreboding music]

19:01.200 --> 19:02.490
Not on fucking break, people!

19:02.690 --> 19:04.440
On the clock. On the clock.

19:09.310 --> 19:10.260
Hey, hey, hey.

19:10.460 --> 19:11.630
Hey, quit fucking around!

19:11.830 --> 19:13.450
Let's go!

19:14.680 --> 19:20.990
[foreboding music]

19:32.300 --> 19:34.150
[engine turns over]

19:34.350 --> 19:36.100
[horn honks]

19:45.910 --> 19:51.250
[tense music]

19:52.020 --> 19:54.890
Fuck! Fuck! Man!

20:06.900 --> 20:14.310
[ethereal music]

20:16.440 --> 20:17.230
Yeah.

20:17.430 --> 20:19.960
Yeah, Carney, I'll tell him.

20:20.160 --> 20:22.300
No, I don't wanna know
the fucking details, okay?

20:22.500 --> 20:23.800
Just...

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
Jesus Christ, enough.

20:25.200 --> 20:27.510
I've got it!

20:27.710 --> 20:29.770
Look, I gotta go.
I'll call him. I'll tell him.

20:29.970 --> 20:30.740
Yeah.

20:30.940 --> 20:32.330
[hangs up]

20:32.960 --> 20:34.480
Dinner.

20:34.680 --> 20:36.610
Shit, I'm so sorry.

20:36.810 --> 20:37.550
I was, um...

20:37.750 --> 20:38.880
I was helping a client,

20:39.080 --> 20:44.590
and then I got wrapped up
with the paperwork and stuff.

20:44.790 --> 20:47.860
Turns out I'm actually good
with the math, though, so...

20:48.060 --> 20:50.280
got that goin'.

20:51.610 --> 20:52.960
Do you wanna go
to the restaurant?

20:53.160 --> 20:54.970
Let's-Let's go.
I can go right now.

20:55.170 --> 20:57.690
I figured you'd
probably be hungry.

20:59.050 --> 21:01.410
Yeah.

21:01.610 --> 21:03.540
Thanks, um...

21:03.740 --> 21:05.040
I'm s--I'm sorry.

21:05.240 --> 21:07.610
You know, Kyle, I really
needed to talk to you

21:07.810 --> 21:09.880
at dinner tonight.

21:10.080 --> 21:11.520
Okay.

21:11.720 --> 21:14.150
About what?

21:14.350 --> 21:17.090
I think I'm gonna go to
my dad's place for a bit.

21:17.290 --> 21:18.560
What? Why?

21:18.760 --> 21:21.790
Dad's doing some PT
and he needs help.

21:21.990 --> 21:24.630
And, um...

21:24.830 --> 21:29.100
Everything's a little
too crazy right now.

21:29.300 --> 21:30.970
And I need...

21:31.170 --> 21:32.370
I need to get away from it.

21:32.570 --> 21:34.040
All of it.

21:34.240 --> 21:36.110
For a minute.

21:36.310 --> 21:37.110
Like, just for a minute?

21:37.310 --> 21:40.180
I mean, what are
we talking about?

21:40.380 --> 21:42.260
You can come with me,
if you want.

21:48.770 --> 21:51.370
I can't, Tracy.
I can't.

21:52.810 --> 21:54.690
All right.

21:54.890 --> 21:56.480
Couldn't hurt to ask.

21:59.180 --> 22:00.200
Trace...

22:00.400 --> 22:02.550
I'll call you when
I get to Jersey.

22:03.650 --> 22:04.870
Trace!

22:05.070 --> 22:07.910
Tracy, come on!

22:08.110 --> 22:09.140
Tracy!

22:09.340 --> 22:11.010
[door shuts]

[pensive music]

22:26.240 --> 22:30.030
[phone ringing]

22:30.230 --> 22:31.660
- Yeah?
- [Kyle] <i>Yo.</i>

22:31.860 --> 22:32.900
I'm on my way there.

22:33.100 --> 22:34.300
Everything all right?

22:34.500 --> 22:36.770
[sighs] Yeah, not really.

22:36.970 --> 22:38.900
But, um...

22:39.100 --> 22:40.610
Yeah, everything's fine.

22:40.810 --> 22:41.670
Um, hey, listen.

22:41.870 --> 22:44.910
Um, Carney called
about, uh, Mom's kid.

22:45.110 --> 22:46.310
You know, the AB kid?

22:46.510 --> 22:47.550
<i>Kareem told them to--</i>

22:47.750 --> 22:49.210
Yeah, he got him?

22:49.410 --> 22:50.880
[Kyle] <i>Nah, he's dead, Mike.</i>

22:51.080 --> 22:52.600
<i>Kid killed himself.</i>

22:53.970 --> 22:55.850
Fuck.

22:56.050 --> 22:57.890
Yeah, so...

22:58.090 --> 23:00.240
Anyway, I'll see ya.

23:04.050 --> 23:09.950
[pensive music]

23:29.070 --> 23:30.400
[front door shuts]

23:32.210 --> 23:34.860
Hey, do you have a hot date?

23:35.060 --> 23:36.810
They're all too young.

23:49.020 --> 23:50.740
What?

23:50.940 --> 23:54.450
- So the prison called.
- About Jacob.

23:54.650 --> 23:56.330
- Yeah.
- [Mariam] Uh-huh.

23:57.830 --> 23:58.850
Oh.

23:59.050 --> 24:00.500
They couldn't move him?

24:02.300 --> 24:03.910
The kid killed himself.

24:05.240 --> 24:11.650
[gentle music]

24:12.850 --> 24:14.550
Oh.

24:15.780 --> 24:17.500
How?

24:17.700 --> 24:20.490
- You don't wanna know.
- I need to know.

24:21.490 --> 24:23.660
He laid underneath a truck.

24:27.630 --> 24:29.210
[Mariam] You know, I, um...

24:29.410 --> 24:32.220
I-I don't know why
he was in prison.

24:32.420 --> 24:34.390
He could've killed somebody.

24:34.590 --> 24:36.290
It doesn't matter.

24:36.490 --> 24:39.590
He-He said to me, um...

24:39.790 --> 24:42.690
he had a baby.

24:42.890 --> 24:45.230
A baby boy.

24:45.430 --> 24:48.380
He was barely more
than a boy himself.

24:56.190 --> 24:58.360
You help yourself, honey.

25:00.390 --> 25:02.380
I can't stay, Mom.

25:02.580 --> 25:04.530
Doesn't matter.

25:06.330 --> 25:14.080
[gentle music]

Fuck.

25:54.050 --> 25:59.800
[phone ringing]

26:00.000 --> 26:01.590
Here we go.

26:02.920 --> 26:06.490
[phone ringing]

26:07.190 --> 26:08.660
Yeah.

26:11.370 --> 26:14.020
[sighs]
Hello, it's Mike.

26:14.220 --> 26:16.470
[Iris] <i>Hey, Mike.</i>

26:18.140 --> 26:20.680
How are you doing?

26:22.640 --> 26:24.930
Could use a night on a boat.

26:25.130 --> 26:26.710
You?

26:28.020 --> 26:30.170
Same.

26:30.370 --> 26:32.540
[Iris] <i>Trouble sleeping?</i>

26:32.740 --> 26:34.890
Not more than usual.

26:37.630 --> 26:39.880
Are you okay?

26:40.080 --> 26:42.430
<i>Healthy?</i>

26:43.230 --> 26:46.480
I'm fine, Mike.

26:46.680 --> 26:48.570
I wanna see you.

26:51.810 --> 26:53.210
Oh.

26:53.880 --> 26:56.930
Okay.

26:57.130 --> 26:58.430
When and where?

26:58.630 --> 27:00.230
[Iris] <i>Tomorrow.</i>

27:00.430 --> 27:01.370
<i>Midnight.</i>

27:01.570 --> 27:03.370
The park off 20 Mile Road.

27:03.570 --> 27:05.870
Under the arch by the trestle.

27:06.070 --> 27:06.920
[Mike] <i>Okay, got it.</i>

27:09.020 --> 27:11.180
Iris?

27:11.380 --> 27:13.130
<i>You're almost there.</i>

27:15.030 --> 27:22.870
[sinister music]

27:48.260 --> 27:50.080
Mike, you gotta get Bunny
to quit bullshittin'

27:50.280 --> 27:51.480
and play fucking ball.

27:51.680 --> 27:54.590
This is how we start the day.
Is that it?

27:54.790 --> 27:57.220
Okay, look.
You expect Bunny

27:57.420 --> 27:58.460
just to cough over
fuckin', like,

27:58.660 --> 28:00.120
a quarter million
dollars' worth of guns?

28:00.320 --> 28:01.530
You want fuckin'
peace on the street?

28:01.730 --> 28:04.600
You get him to get those
guns back to us fuckin' now.

28:04.800 --> 28:06.100
All of them, all right?

28:06.300 --> 28:07.970
Because he's asking for war,
and I'll tell you something.

28:08.170 --> 28:10.970
ATF's just the
fuckin' start here.

28:11.170 --> 28:13.220
All right, I get it.

28:15.260 --> 28:16.720
Give me a minute.

28:19.260 --> 28:21.650
- What's the word, fellas?
- Talk to you a second?

28:21.850 --> 28:23.300
- Yeah, what's up?
- Yeah, uh...

28:25.630 --> 28:27.450
Did you fucking do it?

28:27.650 --> 28:28.920
Do what?

28:29.120 --> 28:30.650
Morris is dead.

28:30.860 --> 28:32.610
You're off the hook.
Yeah.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.900
Did you fucking kill him?

28:38.100 --> 28:40.800
[laughs] What the fuck, Mike?

28:41.000 --> 28:42.900
It's a simple fucking question.

28:43.100 --> 28:44.300
No. Fuck no.

28:44.500 --> 28:46.200
Do you think that
I would just...I mean, that's--

28:46.400 --> 28:47.970
I just need you to
look me in the fucking eye

28:48.170 --> 28:49.340
and tell me that
you didn't do it, okay?

28:49.540 --> 28:51.380
I need to fucking know that.

28:51.580 --> 28:52.730
Fuck you.

28:54.100 --> 28:55.810
That's a fucked-up thing
to say to somebody.

28:56.010 --> 28:57.180
Is it?

28:57.380 --> 28:58.680
Yeah, we're supposed
to be fucking friends.

28:58.880 --> 29:00.300
Fuck you.

29:01.370 --> 29:03.390
That's fucked up, Mike.

29:03.590 --> 29:05.240
I have to ask.

29:07.910 --> 29:15.620
[dramatic music]

29:23.590 --> 29:25.710
Gee, that's twice
in two days, man.

29:25.910 --> 29:27.310
People gonna talk.

29:27.510 --> 29:29.710
It's you and me, alone.

29:29.910 --> 29:31.850
[Bunny] Yeah, I'm a little out
of your weight class, homie.

29:32.050 --> 29:35.800
Nah, just two minutes.
Come on.

29:37.700 --> 29:39.960
[train whistle]

29:40.160 --> 29:41.740
Clock's tickin', man.
What you got for me?

29:42.710 --> 29:44.000
I need the guns.

29:44.200 --> 29:45.930
- Say what?
- All of them.

29:46.130 --> 29:47.160
The ATF is coming.

29:47.360 --> 29:48.370
You've got the
attention of people

29:48.570 --> 29:50.230
whose attention you do not want.

29:50.430 --> 29:53.100
So give me the guns.
I'll drop them on their porch.

29:53.300 --> 29:54.840
No questions, no tape.

29:55.040 --> 29:56.040
Make sure there's
no prints on 'em.

29:56.240 --> 29:57.510
You're clean.

29:57.710 --> 30:00.310
You think I'm dumb enough
to leave prints on that shit?

30:00.510 --> 30:02.730
Shit, that's why
God made Nu-Skin, baby.

30:05.830 --> 30:07.790
Yeah.

30:07.990 --> 30:09.620
Listen, Bunny.

30:09.820 --> 30:13.560
I know I tested our
shit putting you inside.

30:13.760 --> 30:15.160
I know that you were
in there longer than--

30:15.360 --> 30:18.250
You put me in a
fuckin' hole, Mike.

30:23.220 --> 30:25.520
I trusted people
I shouldn't have.

30:26.490 --> 30:28.870
Yeah.

30:29.070 --> 30:31.160
Yeah, I feel that.

30:34.360 --> 30:40.150
[unsettling music]

30:40.350 --> 30:42.190
You want them guns?

30:42.390 --> 30:44.020
I need all of them.

30:44.220 --> 30:48.290
All right, well...

30:48.490 --> 30:50.730
you already know what I want.

30:50.930 --> 30:52.430
You can't have that.

30:52.630 --> 30:54.230
But you ain't the king, Mike.

30:54.430 --> 30:57.220
What the king wants,
the king gets.

31:01.190 --> 31:04.190
[line trilling]

31:06.790 --> 31:09.010

32:08.090 --> 32:09.990
I'm spending my own money.

32:15.100 --> 32:16.730
I bought you.

32:17.800 --> 32:19.370
For three hours.

32:26.610 --> 32:27.930
Fuck you.

32:28.130 --> 32:29.680
That's the start!

32:30.740 --> 32:34.420
I bought you like
a fucking pair of shoes!

32:35.280 --> 32:38.390
Now...I'm going to wear you out.

32:42.320 --> 32:45.340
You're nothing!
Remember that.

32:45.540 --> 32:48.010
You're only what I
fucking tell you you are.

32:48.210 --> 32:50.500
Fucking bitch!

33:41.130 --> 33:42.500

I need to get to him.

33:54.360 --> 33:57.010
How could you not
fucking tell me that?

33:57.210 --> 33:59.620
I don't know, I'm just saying
I didn't fuckin' tell ya.

33:59.820 --> 34:01.450
I didn't tell anybody.

34:01.650 --> 34:04.060
- Hey, you guys seen Robert?
- Mikey, hey!

34:04.260 --> 34:05.620
Probably at the fucking gym.

34:05.820 --> 34:06.890
[Kyle] Or at his kid's recital.

34:07.090 --> 34:08.630
Kid's gonna be a fucking
professional ballerina.

34:08.830 --> 34:09.730
Ballerino.

34:09.930 --> 34:11.030
Fucking find him, all right?

34:11.230 --> 34:12.230
Just fucking find him.

34:12.430 --> 34:14.200
- Tell him to stay inside.
- Yeah.

34:14.400 --> 34:15.630
- [Mike] That simple.
- What is it, Mike?

34:15.830 --> 34:16.730

34:48.060 --> 34:49.700
[Robert] <i>That's not a very good</i>
<i>tone for a fuckin' apology.</i>

34:49.900 --> 34:51.740
