WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:04.103
-<i> Previously on</i> The Strain...
(snarling and screeching)

00:08.509 --> 00:12.110
- People of Red Hook!
This day will go down in history

00:12.112 --> 00:14.979
as a turning point. As the
moment the people of New York

00:14.981 --> 00:18.315
came together and stopped
these bastards.

00:18.317 --> 00:21.651
(cheering)
- This is reputed to be an image

00:21.653 --> 00:24.387
from the<i> Occido Lumen.</i>
- An ancient book.

00:24.389 --> 00:27.890
If I can find it, it may tell me
how to destroy the Master.

00:27.892 --> 00:30.459
- Still chasing it after all
these years.

00:30.461 --> 00:32.994
- Soon I will have it.
Tell me who has the book.

00:32.996 --> 00:35.463
- Rudyard Fonescu.

00:35.465 --> 00:38.199
- The boy from the convent.
- What happened to your ear?

00:38.201 --> 00:41.035
- My father, sir. He held
my head against the stove

00:41.037 --> 00:43.504
to drive off the devil, he said.
- Do you know how to use

00:43.506 --> 00:45.539
that thing?
- Simple enough.

00:45.541 --> 00:47.541
- I'm guessing the rifle
you're carrying

00:47.543 --> 00:50.477
is not meant only for<i> strigoi.</i>
- No, it's not.

00:50.479 --> 00:55.381
- What are you going to do now?
- I'm going to kill Eldritch Palmer.

01:19.273 --> 01:22.440
I don't suppose you got all this
stuff at the nearest Radio Shack.

01:22.442 --> 01:24.375
- Called in a favour.

01:24.377 --> 01:27.945
- What did you do for all these
techie criminal weirdos

01:27.947 --> 01:30.180
that they owe you favours?
- My mother taught me

01:30.182 --> 01:32.882
that cultivating relationships
is just as important

01:32.884 --> 01:34.884
as cultivating skill.

01:34.886 --> 01:38.087
Especially for someone like me.
- Like you how?

01:38.089 --> 01:41.756
- Someone who can't skate by
in life just on her looks.

01:41.758 --> 01:44.525
(laughing)
- What?

01:44.527 --> 01:47.594
- If I showed you my school
yearbook photo, you'd understand.

01:47.596 --> 01:50.096
- Yeah, well, you pulled it
together pretty well.

01:50.098 --> 01:52.565
(Dutch grunts)
- How's that work?

01:52.567 --> 01:56.468
- The laser can read incredibly subtle
vibrations on the window glass.

01:56.470 --> 01:58.903
- Isn't that how they found out
where Bin Laden was hiding?

01:58.905 --> 02:00.938
- A rudimentary version
of it, yeah.

02:00.940 --> 02:03.106
This beauty has
an interferometer,

02:03.108 --> 02:07.109
which can convert the readings
back into crystal-clear sound.

02:07.111 --> 02:09.111
Or it will --

02:09.113 --> 02:12.280
as soon as anybody's in there.

02:18.754 --> 02:22.222
So, you wanna to tell me
your life story?

02:22.224 --> 02:24.224
- Not really, no.

02:24.226 --> 02:26.726
- No, me neither.

02:34.268 --> 02:36.501
(indistinct yelling)

02:39.005 --> 02:41.805
- You have raised your voices,
my friends,

02:41.807 --> 02:43.973
and we have answered:

02:43.975 --> 02:46.842
the Safe Streets Initiative
is coming

02:46.844 --> 02:49.544
to the Upper East Side!
(applause)

02:52.015 --> 02:54.115
We're movin' on up!

02:54.117 --> 02:57.918
(laughing and talking)
(throat clearing)

02:57.920 --> 03:01.321
Uh, and I will now
pass the podium

03:01.323 --> 03:05.124
to my fearless co-leader,

03:05.126 --> 03:07.493
Councilwoman Justine Faraldo!

03:07.495 --> 03:10.061
(whooping)

03:12.198 --> 03:14.364
- Thank you.

03:14.366 --> 03:17.600
I remember walking by
this very store

03:17.602 --> 03:19.668
when I was a kid.

03:19.670 --> 03:21.870
I was with my mother
and my brother,

03:21.872 --> 03:24.505
and my mother said,
"If I worked for a month,

03:24.507 --> 03:27.007
I couldn't afford to buy
a key chain in that place."

03:27.009 --> 03:29.275
(chuckling)
Well, Ma,

03:29.277 --> 03:31.777
now I got keys
to the front door!

03:31.779 --> 03:34.012
(clapping)

03:36.783 --> 03:39.550
We're going to make
all of New York safe,

03:39.552 --> 03:41.752
but we're coming here next.

03:43.388 --> 03:46.888
But the safety and security
that only we can provide

03:46.890 --> 03:49.790
comes at a cost.

03:49.792 --> 03:52.392
All residents
of the Upper East Side

03:52.394 --> 03:54.727
will contribute one percent
of their property value

03:54.729 --> 03:58.697
to the S.S.I.,
payable in gold, silver,

03:58.699 --> 04:01.232
or other approved commodities.

04:01.234 --> 04:05.201
(muttering)
Across the river in Brooklyn,

04:05.203 --> 04:08.837
the good citizens
of Red Hook rose up

04:08.839 --> 04:11.306
and fought shoulder-to-shoulder

04:11.308 --> 04:14.742
with my men. They paid
with their blood.

04:14.744 --> 04:17.644
Something tells me
the Upper East Side would prefer

04:17.646 --> 04:21.513
to pay with their wallets.
Quality, as you people know,

04:21.515 --> 04:24.182
does not come cheap.

04:24.184 --> 04:27.251
So, Captain Kowalski

04:27.253 --> 04:29.319
will now explain
to you in detail

04:29.321 --> 04:31.387
how the S.S.I. will be

04:31.389 --> 04:33.389
implemented. Thank you.

04:33.391 --> 04:36.058
(hubbub)

04:36.060 --> 04:38.827
- Justine!

04:38.829 --> 04:40.995
You can't do this.

04:40.997 --> 04:42.997
- Mayor, I just did.

04:42.999 --> 04:45.566
- (man): Settle down, people.

04:45.568 --> 04:48.068
(theme music)

05:06.922 --> 05:10.089
- Has anyone ever actually
seen this book?

05:10.091 --> 05:12.524
- Several people have seen it.

05:12.526 --> 05:15.026
None of them, however,
are available

05:15.028 --> 05:17.628
to discuss it.
There are strange stories

05:17.630 --> 05:20.864
of the book turning up in India

05:20.866 --> 05:23.266
and Burma, always

05:23.268 --> 05:25.500
presaging massacres, upheavals.

05:28.071 --> 05:30.471
- So if we find this,
it might hurt us.

05:30.473 --> 05:32.873
- You're not wrong,
Dr. Martinez.

05:32.875 --> 05:35.742
In 1856, it was listed

05:35.744 --> 05:38.711
as part of an auction
in Marseille.

05:38.713 --> 05:40.713
The auction was canceled

05:40.715 --> 05:42.948
when a mysterious outbreak
gripped the city.

05:42.950 --> 05:45.483
Since then the book
has disappeared.

05:45.485 --> 05:48.819
It is said to be cursed,
bringing death and disaster

05:48.821 --> 05:50.787
to anyone who reads it.

05:50.789 --> 05:53.890
But I'm willing
to take that risk.

05:53.892 --> 05:56.125
(indistinct talking)

06:16.914 --> 06:19.147
- Stay here.

06:53.982 --> 06:56.549
- What are you doing here?

06:56.551 --> 06:59.885
- You walk up three flights

06:59.887 --> 07:03.888
every time you come in and out?
- That's how it works.

07:03.890 --> 07:06.223
- I, uh...

07:09.528 --> 07:11.528
I've come to apologize.

07:11.530 --> 07:14.364
- It's too late for that.

07:14.366 --> 07:17.734
- Coco, I've never felt
anything like this.

07:17.736 --> 07:20.536
It's like I'm being
burned alive.

07:20.538 --> 07:23.338
- It's called heartbreak.

07:23.340 --> 07:26.374
And I'm sorry it's unpleasant
for you, but you caused it.

07:26.376 --> 07:28.809
It's not my job to fix it.

07:28.811 --> 07:32.979
- All my life my illness
separated me from everyone else.

07:32.981 --> 07:36.549
Over the years while
my classmates all married

07:36.551 --> 07:39.418
and had families, I just sank

07:39.420 --> 07:42.988
further and further
into my own bitterness.

07:42.990 --> 07:45.557
All that changed when I met you.

07:45.559 --> 07:49.560
I need you, Coco.

07:49.562 --> 07:52.229
- You think you're the only one

07:52.231 --> 07:54.764
who's had a difficult life?

07:54.766 --> 07:56.899
You think that entitles
you to something?

07:56.901 --> 08:00.269
- Please.

08:00.271 --> 08:02.237
Come back to me, Coco.

08:02.239 --> 08:04.438
I want to...

08:06.708 --> 08:10.676
I love you.
I will prove myself to you.

08:19.919 --> 08:22.753
- I can't believe that there are
this many "R. Fonescu's" listed

08:22.755 --> 08:24.888
in the phone book.
- Yeah.

08:24.890 --> 08:27.790
A couple generations ago,
some virile, happening Fonescu

08:27.792 --> 08:30.259
must have gotten around, huh?

08:36.132 --> 08:40.133
(buttons buzzing)
(escalating sirens)

08:41.903 --> 08:44.136
(loud buzzing)

08:49.209 --> 08:51.442
(club music plays)

08:58.283 --> 09:01.050
(creature snarling)

09:01.052 --> 09:04.086
(croaking)

09:04.088 --> 09:06.854
(screeching)

09:09.225 --> 09:11.992
(creature growling)
(Fet grunting)

09:11.994 --> 09:14.728
(screeching)
(glass shattering)

09:21.736 --> 09:24.336
- Gotta respect
a guy who, uh, keeps

09:24.338 --> 09:26.971
the party going
no matter what, huh?

09:29.008 --> 09:31.241
(music stops)

09:39.750 --> 09:43.051
- I'm not getting a strong
book collector's vibe.

09:46.922 --> 09:50.356
- Two down, two to go.
(sigh)

09:57.030 --> 09:58.996
- Do you know what bonobos are?

09:58.998 --> 10:01.532
- Yeah, they're a kind
of pygmy chimpanzee.

10:01.534 --> 10:04.134
- Zoos don't want to keep them.
Do you know why?

10:04.136 --> 10:07.403
Because they're constantly
having sex with each other.

10:07.405 --> 10:11.039
Males and females,
males and males,

10:11.041 --> 10:13.441
females and females.

10:13.443 --> 10:16.277
It's not exactly
family-friendly.

10:16.279 --> 10:18.712
- I'm glad I'm finally getting

10:18.714 --> 10:20.714
a window into what's
happening inside your mind.

10:20.716 --> 10:25.051
- My point is, they're
completely promiscuous --

10:25.053 --> 10:26.986
and happy.

10:26.988 --> 10:28.921
They resolve all their conflicts
through shagging and don't

10:28.923 --> 10:32.591
feel the need to kill each
other. Maybe monogamy is just

10:32.593 --> 10:34.826
some arbitrary, punishing rule.

10:34.828 --> 10:37.628
Society does not accept the idea
that you can love more

10:37.630 --> 10:40.831
than one person at a time.
You have to make a choice.

10:40.833 --> 10:43.469
And if you don't, you're
a selfish bastard.

10:43.495 --> 10:44.934
You've betrayed someone.

10:44.936 --> 10:48.637
- Making choices
is part of life.

10:48.639 --> 10:51.339
- Be honest with me.

10:51.341 --> 10:54.075
No judgment.

10:54.077 --> 10:57.278
Did you really resist
the sultry temptation

10:57.280 --> 11:00.247
of Dr. Martinez 'til
after your divorce?

11:00.249 --> 11:02.082
- As a matter of fact, I did.

11:02.084 --> 11:04.517
- Still wanted her though,
right?

11:04.519 --> 11:06.819
You wanted them both.

11:06.821 --> 11:08.821
It's only natural.

11:08.823 --> 11:11.123
- Is that why you're here?
Is that why you wanted

11:11.125 --> 11:13.325
to do this with me so badly?
So you could avoid

11:13.327 --> 11:15.327
your little love triangle
back home?

11:15.329 --> 11:17.295
- Letting go
of one of them feels

11:17.297 --> 11:19.664
like cutting off
one of my arms.

11:21.267 --> 11:24.568
- (Eldritch):<i> See? Your desk</i>
<i> is just as you left it.</i>

11:29.874 --> 11:31.940
<i>Shall I order us some lunch?</i>

11:31.942 --> 11:34.208
-<i> I'm not hungry.</i>

11:36.178 --> 11:38.645
- Palmer and his secretary.

11:38.647 --> 11:42.215
Looks like you're not the only
one with love troubles.

11:42.217 --> 11:46.085
- Screwing the assistant, eh?
Bit of a cliché.

11:48.122 --> 11:51.323
-<i> I shouldn't</i> <i> have come back here.</i>
-<i> But of course you should have.</i>

11:51.325 --> 11:55.726
<i> You've changed my entire--</i>
(phone ringing)

11:55.728 --> 11:57.728
-<i> Yes?</i>

11:57.730 --> 12:01.698
<i> What?</i>
<i> Of course, send him in.</i>

12:01.700 --> 12:03.733
-<i> No, no. I don't want</i>
<i> to see anyone right now.</i>

12:03.735 --> 12:06.134
-<i> It's the Mayor.</i>
-<i> Ugh.</i>

12:08.838 --> 12:11.405
<i>Mr. Mayor. I would appreciate it</i>

12:11.407 --> 12:13.540
<i> if you would call ahead.</i>

12:13.542 --> 12:16.209
-<i> There's no time for that.</i>

12:16.211 --> 12:19.845
<i> Eldritch, I need a favour.</i>

12:19.847 --> 12:23.715
<i>Do you have a relationship with</i>
<i> Councilwoman Justine Faraldo?</i>

12:23.717 --> 12:26.984
-<i> Uh, no, I can't say</i>
<i> I've had the pleasure.</i>

12:26.986 --> 12:30.320
-<i> You know she's coming to</i>
<i>the Upper East Side next, right?</i>

12:30.322 --> 12:32.255
-<i> Yes, I had heard that.</i>

12:32.257 --> 12:34.690
-<i> Well, she just</i>
<i> dropped the bomb</i>

12:34.692 --> 12:37.826
<i> that, in exchange</i>
<i> for her services,</i>

12:37.828 --> 12:40.261
she's instituting
a one percent parcel tax

12:40.263 --> 12:42.229
on the entire neighborhood.

12:42.231 --> 12:45.198
She has no authority to do that.
- What are you worried about?

12:45.200 --> 12:47.066
Let her self-destruct over this.

12:47.068 --> 12:50.903
-<i> No, she won't.</i>
<i> She's too clever.</i>

12:50.905 --> 12:54.840
<i> The only one who's going to be</i>
<i>destroyed by any of this is me,</i>

12:54.842 --> 12:57.409
for suggesting she take on
the Upper East Side next.

12:57.411 --> 12:59.910
- What do you want
from me?

13:01.613 --> 13:03.613
- Talk some sense into her.

13:03.615 --> 13:05.748
<i> Tell her she is not going</i>

13:05.750 --> 13:08.283
<i>to save the city by pissing off</i>

13:08.285 --> 13:10.251
<i>its most influential residents.</i>

13:10.253 --> 13:13.921
- Well, it's high time for me
to meet the Councilwoman anyway.

13:13.923 --> 13:17.390
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

13:17.392 --> 13:19.425
Thank you.

13:19.427 --> 13:22.194
Goodbye.

13:22.196 --> 13:25.630
- Coco,

13:25.632 --> 13:29.633
<i> will you tell Joshua</i>
<i> to get the car ready?</i>

13:29.635 --> 13:32.068
<i> We'll pay the councilwoman</i>

13:32.070 --> 13:34.403
<i> a little unexpected visit.</i>

13:34.405 --> 13:36.605
<i> Oh, and tip off the press</i>

13:36.607 --> 13:39.140
<i> that we'll be there at 3:00.</i>

13:41.544 --> 13:43.777
- We gotta find a perch
and get set up.

13:43.779 --> 13:46.679
We need to get moving.

13:51.419 --> 13:55.020
- Say good-bye to eternal life,
you son of a bitch.

14:06.165 --> 14:08.231
(tires screeching)
- (Nora): Someone lives here?

14:08.233 --> 14:10.967
- Perhaps Fonescu
has an apartment

14:10.969 --> 14:13.602
above his place of business,
as I used to.

14:13.604 --> 14:16.504
(distant siren)
Mr. Fet?

14:29.585 --> 14:33.386
(bell jangles)
(soft violin music)

14:38.158 --> 14:40.391
(bell jangles)

14:46.532 --> 14:49.032
- It'll take us a year to get
through all of these.

14:49.034 --> 14:52.835
- The book is much too precious
to be kept in a public shop.

14:52.837 --> 14:55.037
- Here, Professor,

14:55.039 --> 14:57.272
after you.

15:10.119 --> 15:13.854
(heavy breathing)

15:17.325 --> 15:19.325
Hey. Knock first.

15:19.327 --> 15:23.395
(door creaking)
Or be less formal.

15:26.032 --> 15:28.165
- Start searching.

15:28.167 --> 15:31.401
My sources tell me the<i> Lumen</i>
is bound in silver

15:31.403 --> 15:34.404
but check every volume
just in case.

15:34.406 --> 15:36.606
It has to be here somewhere.

15:38.576 --> 15:41.710
(intense music)

16:07.937 --> 16:10.037
- It's almost time.

16:10.039 --> 16:12.406
We good?
- All good.

16:12.408 --> 16:17.210
We'll just need to haul ass down the fire
escape, get to the bike, and we're good.

16:17.212 --> 16:19.212
- And there's nothing
blocking our way?

16:19.214 --> 16:21.847
- Oh, I thought you might
like a rest,

16:21.849 --> 16:24.382
so I put a nice big
sofa-bed down there.

16:24.384 --> 16:27.485
Was that not a good idea?

16:46.706 --> 16:49.073
You look pretty cool right now,
by the way.

16:49.075 --> 16:52.142
- Thanks.

16:53.778 --> 16:55.911
- You've changed a lot since
my first impression of you.

16:55.913 --> 16:58.546
Seriously, though.

16:58.548 --> 17:01.482
This is pretty badass of you.

17:01.484 --> 17:04.884
- Yeah, well. I won't be
that badass if I miss.

17:07.088 --> 17:09.888
(clamour)

17:11.725 --> 17:14.992
- Your specious proposition

17:14.994 --> 17:17.294
is illegal and unconstitutional.

17:17.296 --> 17:19.296
- Do you really want
your clients to go on record

17:19.298 --> 17:22.599
as saying that they refused to
do their part in the war effort?

17:22.601 --> 17:24.567
Who are they more afraid of,

17:24.569 --> 17:27.436
the vampires or pissed-off
fellow New Yorkers?

17:27.438 --> 17:32.107
- There is room for compromise here.
- I could compromise my guys

17:32.109 --> 17:33.980
right out of the Upper
East Side, how about that?

17:34.006 --> 17:35.477
We'll go back to
cleaning out Brooklyn!

17:35.479 --> 17:38.179
- You wouldn't dare.
- Trust me,

17:38.181 --> 17:41.649
you don't want to play "you
wouldn't dare" with me.

17:41.651 --> 17:44.118
(inaudible muttering)
- Excuse me.

17:44.120 --> 17:47.354
I'll return momentarily.
- This time tomorrow

17:47.356 --> 17:50.623
I'm gonna be back here with a court
order to stop this extortion.

17:50.625 --> 17:53.292
- Bring it. In the meantime,

17:53.294 --> 17:55.927
does anybody else
have any intelligent

17:55.929 --> 17:58.829
questions to ask me?

18:04.870 --> 18:08.304
(scoffing)
- Where is he?

18:08.306 --> 18:11.206
(distant voices)

18:17.047 --> 18:19.013
- He's here. You ready?

18:19.015 --> 18:22.216
- Okay, this is it.
Just remember to breathe.

18:30.659 --> 18:33.459
(siren)
- (security guard): We're good.

18:41.501 --> 18:44.168
- Mr. Palmer, what message do you intend
to deliver to Councilwoman Faraldo?

18:44.170 --> 18:47.237
- Do you believe what the
Councilwoman is doing is illegal?

18:47.239 --> 18:49.339
- I think she's doing
a marvelous job, and I'm here

18:49.341 --> 18:51.908
to offer her my encouragement
and assistance.

18:55.846 --> 18:58.913
- Shit.
- We'll get it;

18:58.915 --> 19:02.016
just be patient.

19:02.018 --> 19:04.651
(heavy breathing)

19:04.653 --> 19:07.720
- I think I can get him, if he'd
just stop moving for a second!

19:07.722 --> 19:10.589
- Just wait.

19:10.591 --> 19:12.857
- Mr. Palmer, is Stoneheart
contributing financially

19:12.859 --> 19:15.258
to the Councilwoman's Safe
Street Initiative?

19:17.495 --> 19:19.695
- We're gonna lose him.
I'm gonna take the shot.

19:19.697 --> 19:21.897
- No! If we miss,
he'll be on lockdown.

19:21.899 --> 19:25.300
We'll never get another chance.
You need a clean shot.

19:28.905 --> 19:32.039
- Come on, move!
- Wait.

19:32.041 --> 19:34.941
Wait...

19:34.943 --> 19:37.009
Now! Do it!
(gunshot)

19:37.011 --> 19:39.510
(crowd yelling)
- (woman): Oh, my God!

19:41.947 --> 19:44.548
- We gotta go!

19:44.550 --> 19:47.884
Move it, Doc!
- Oh, my God!

19:47.886 --> 19:51.954
- C'mon! There's no time!
Move it! They're already coming!

19:55.192 --> 19:57.825
(screaming)
(policemen shouting)

19:57.827 --> 19:59.827
- (man): Guys, who's got eyes?

19:59.829 --> 20:02.229
- What happened?
- You're all right, sir.

20:02.231 --> 20:04.364
- (reporter): I'm not sure
what's going on right now...

20:04.366 --> 20:08.501
- All units at the perimeter.
Find me the shooter.

20:08.527 --> 20:09.560
- Coco!

20:19.346 --> 20:22.980
(escalating sirens)

20:25.818 --> 20:28.318
- Shit!

20:33.658 --> 20:36.392
Here!

20:42.365 --> 20:45.399
- (man): ...stairs,
it's really important.

20:45.401 --> 20:48.135
(voices chattering)

20:54.576 --> 20:57.343
(sirens)
- (radio):<i> Attention all units:</i>

20:57.345 --> 21:00.512
<i> shots fired at the patrolled</i> <i> area.
Look out for anyone</i> <i> suspicious.</i>

21:00.514 --> 21:03.815
- Copy that. We're heading south
right now, proceeding on foot.

21:10.789 --> 21:13.523
- Hey! Hey, you!

21:13.525 --> 21:17.092
- Run!
- I got 'em! Madison and 56th!

21:19.362 --> 21:21.862
(heavy breathing)

21:36.978 --> 21:40.079
- Ah! Ah!

21:40.081 --> 21:42.548
Go!
(sirens)

21:42.550 --> 21:46.151
(car horns)

21:46.153 --> 21:48.453
- Freeze! Get your hands up!
(police radio chattering)

21:52.992 --> 21:56.326
- You find anything?
- Uh...

21:56.328 --> 21:58.628
Nothing about the<i> strigoi,</i>

21:58.630 --> 22:01.230
but I did find

22:01.232 --> 22:03.932
Fonescu's secret stash
of vintage girly magazines.

22:03.934 --> 22:07.068
Rrr.
- Charming.

22:07.070 --> 22:09.103
- (reporter):
<i> We have breaking news.</i>

22:09.105 --> 22:11.138
<i>there has been an assassination</i>
<i> attempt on philanthropist</i>

22:11.140 --> 22:13.673
<i> Eldritch Palmer.</i>
<i> Mr. Palmer was arriving</i>

22:13.675 --> 22:16.175
<i> at Councilwoman Justine</i>
<i> Faraldo's new headquarters</i>

22:16.177 --> 22:18.810
<i> at Neuman Vogel's</i>
<i> when a single shot was fired.</i>

22:18.812 --> 22:21.679
<i> We are receiving unconfirmed</i>
<i> reports that the suspects,</i>

22:21.681 --> 22:24.281
<i> a man and a woman,</i>
<i> have been taken into custody.</i>

22:24.283 --> 22:27.284
<i> We have no word on Palmer's</i>
<i> condition. Stay with us</i>

22:27.286 --> 22:30.153
<i> for updates on this important</i>
<i> story, right here at WHXV</i>

22:30.155 --> 22:32.722
<i> New York, where we</i>
<i> bring you the news--</i>

22:36.527 --> 22:39.261
- You know something.
- It's Eph.

22:39.263 --> 22:41.596
The suspect.

22:41.598 --> 22:43.798
And the woman is Dutch.

22:43.800 --> 22:45.800
- Jesus Christ.

22:45.802 --> 22:48.702
- We should be commending him. He may
have just struck a significant blow.

22:48.704 --> 22:51.638
- And he'll probably be executed
for it. They both will.

22:51.640 --> 22:54.374
- I'm sure they understood
the consequences.

22:54.376 --> 22:57.276
- Nearest precinct that would be
holding somebody would be, uh--

22:57.278 --> 23:01.013
the Downtown South at 20th
and 8th. You coming?

23:01.015 --> 23:04.883
- Wait, you can't leave!
We have more searching to do!

23:04.885 --> 23:07.652
- This can wait!
- Nothing is more important

23:07.654 --> 23:10.488
than the<i> Lumen.</i> We must find it
before somebody else does!

23:10.490 --> 23:14.892
- That's not true, Professor. They
are more important than this.

23:22.033 --> 23:24.800
(bell jangling)

23:31.908 --> 23:34.408
(car honking)
- You could've told me,

23:34.410 --> 23:37.544
you know? What Eph was planning.

23:37.546 --> 23:39.946
- I have an aversion to rats.

23:44.051 --> 23:45.917
What would you have said anyway?

23:45.919 --> 23:48.352
- I would have said crossing
this line would change you

23:48.354 --> 23:50.754
forever --
you don't murder people.

23:50.756 --> 23:53.823
- And then he would
have done it anyway.

23:56.260 --> 23:57.302
(heart monitor beeping)

23:57.328 --> 23:59.561
- (man) Make sure the IV
is running well. Scalpel?

23:59.563 --> 24:04.098
- (other man): I think we got major
damage to the right side of the artery.

24:04.100 --> 24:06.033
- (man) Suction?

24:06.035 --> 24:08.935
- (woman)
Attaching another saline.

24:08.937 --> 24:12.071
- (sighing): Horrible.

24:12.073 --> 24:14.940
She took a bullet meant for you.

24:14.942 --> 24:17.342
- (man): Suction. Pumping.

24:17.344 --> 24:20.111
- Tell the Master
I need to see him immediately.

24:20.113 --> 24:22.913
- The Master is aware
of the situation.

24:22.915 --> 24:27.217
- You listen to me! If
the Master doesn't save her...

24:27.219 --> 24:29.519
If she should--

24:29.521 --> 24:33.522
If she doesn't make it through
this thing, I am finished.

24:33.524 --> 24:35.390
No more help.

24:35.392 --> 24:37.625
Everything that He
has been working for,

24:37.627 --> 24:39.627
it will all fall to pieces.

24:39.629 --> 24:41.629
You understand me?

24:41.631 --> 24:43.764
- Yes,

24:43.766 --> 24:47.434
I think I do.

24:47.436 --> 24:50.370
You are demanding that
the Master come here

24:50.372 --> 24:54.440
and release His own divine
and invaluable essence

24:54.442 --> 24:56.475
just so you can continue

24:56.477 --> 24:58.676
fornicating with your secretary.

25:01.213 --> 25:05.280
I will pass along the message.

25:05.282 --> 25:07.582
But what the Master does --

25:07.584 --> 25:09.550
or does not do --

25:09.552 --> 25:12.052
is determined only by Him.

25:12.054 --> 25:15.722
And matters of the heart
are not a high priority.

25:15.724 --> 25:19.257
- (man): I need more suction.
- (woman): Suction.

25:19.259 --> 25:22.727
(sucking)

25:24.430 --> 25:26.496
- Attention with this.
- Got it.

25:26.498 --> 25:28.531
- 15 blade's loaded?

25:35.306 --> 25:37.339
(doctors speaking)

25:37.341 --> 25:39.541
(heart monitor beeping)

25:44.013 --> 25:47.581
- She's stable.
- When will she wake up?

25:47.583 --> 25:49.616
When can I speak to her?
- Uh, Mr. Palmer,

25:49.618 --> 25:51.618
there was a lot of damage.

25:51.620 --> 25:54.621
She also was in pulseless arrest
for nearly four minutes.

25:54.623 --> 25:56.856
It's likely there was
neurological injury.

25:56.858 --> 25:58.824
- But she will wake up?

25:58.826 --> 26:03.094
- I can't say for sure.
Her injuries were very severe.

26:03.096 --> 26:05.429
We won't know for a while.

26:05.431 --> 26:07.764
Please, let her rest.

26:07.766 --> 26:09.966
In fact, the best thing
that you can do right now

26:09.968 --> 26:12.368
is get some rest yourself.

26:27.284 --> 26:30.685
(police chatting)

26:30.687 --> 26:34.055
- Hey, guys, do me a favour?
Could you give me five minutes?

26:34.057 --> 26:36.256
- (man): Oh, OK.
- Thanks.

26:39.160 --> 26:41.460
- Aw, come on, Doc,

26:41.462 --> 26:43.695
we did it!

26:43.697 --> 26:45.663
We took out Eldritch Palmer!

26:45.665 --> 26:49.133
- And now we're in here.
I don't see any version of this

26:49.135 --> 26:52.903
that ends well for us.

26:52.905 --> 26:55.652
- Hey guys, why don't
you go have a cigarette?

26:55.678 --> 26:56.339
- What?

26:56.341 --> 26:58.774
- Just go have a goddamn
cigarette, would you?

27:01.812 --> 27:04.078
(radio chattering)

27:07.316 --> 27:09.883
(keys clinking)

27:14.689 --> 27:15.356
- Ah!

27:15.382 --> 27:18.023
- Wait! What the hell's going on?
Hold on a second! I'm

27:18.025 --> 27:20.191
the one that you want!
(groan)

27:20.193 --> 27:23.093
- Keep talking, buddy.
(Dutch crying out)

27:23.095 --> 27:26.862
- Hey!
You'd better not hurt her!

27:26.864 --> 27:29.397
Hey!

27:29.399 --> 27:31.432
(receding footsteps)

27:31.434 --> 27:35.002
(radio babbling)

27:55.223 --> 27:59.425
- Yes, I'm alive.

28:02.530 --> 28:05.097
You failed.

28:05.099 --> 28:07.933
- If I didn't hit you,
then who did I hit?

28:07.935 --> 28:10.936
- You shot an innocent woman.

28:15.074 --> 28:19.976
- Is she alive?
- She's possibly brain dead.

28:19.978 --> 28:23.212
- I'm sorry for her.

28:26.717 --> 28:29.651
But am I sorry
that I fired that bullet?

28:34.257 --> 28:37.491
- Did Abraham Setrakian
send you to kill me?

28:37.493 --> 28:39.426
- It was my idea.

28:39.428 --> 28:42.829
- It's odd that a man as smart
as you should follow him.

28:42.831 --> 28:45.898
You must know that all this will
be settled in a matter of weeks,

28:45.900 --> 28:48.767
if not days.

28:48.769 --> 28:50.735
The die is cast.

28:50.737 --> 28:52.803
We've won.

28:52.805 --> 28:56.873
Why do you continue to resist?

29:00.511 --> 29:04.112
- You're not obviously insane.

29:04.114 --> 29:06.647
Megalomaniacal, certainly.

29:06.649 --> 29:09.750
Sociopathic? Probably.

29:09.752 --> 29:12.852
- I persist because I understand
the salient facts.

29:14.989 --> 29:17.489
Civilization is in freefall.

29:17.491 --> 29:20.325
Our world is about to change:

29:20.327 --> 29:22.760
violently and forever.

29:22.762 --> 29:25.462
- With you selling out the human
race so you can live

29:25.464 --> 29:27.363
as one of these monsters.

29:27.365 --> 29:29.699
- The dominant species
ravages the land

29:29.701 --> 29:31.701
and makes it its own.

29:31.703 --> 29:34.103
This is a fact beyond

29:34.105 --> 29:37.739
morality or conscience
or sentiment.

29:37.741 --> 29:39.974
Recognizing change

29:39.976 --> 29:41.976
is the key to survival.

29:41.978 --> 29:44.111
- Is this what you came
here to tell me?

29:44.113 --> 29:46.046
Because I don't give a shit

29:46.048 --> 29:49.282
how you rationalize this evil.
(crash)

30:07.668 --> 30:09.734
(scoff)

30:09.736 --> 30:12.570
- The Master couldn't have hoped
for a better lackey.

30:12.572 --> 30:14.605
I'm sorry -- disciple.
- We are

30:14.607 --> 30:18.175
partners.
- (laughing): Partners?

30:18.177 --> 30:19.809
Is that how he treats you?

30:19.811 --> 30:21.811
Huh? Fifty: fifty?

30:21.813 --> 30:23.979
Total respect?

30:23.981 --> 30:26.614
- Why would he share

30:26.616 --> 30:28.983
his great kingdom with anybody?

30:28.985 --> 30:31.418
Ask yourself that.

30:34.456 --> 30:37.590
God, I wish I had succeeded
in killing you.

30:37.592 --> 30:40.659
The world would thank me.
- But you didn't.

30:40.661 --> 30:43.962
And the world will
not even notice

30:43.964 --> 30:46.698
when you die.

31:39.919 --> 31:43.386
(slow footsteps)

31:43.388 --> 31:45.521
(hissing)

31:45.523 --> 31:47.990
(screeching)

31:54.831 --> 31:56.897
- Rudyard?

31:56.899 --> 31:59.299
(sizzling)

32:03.738 --> 32:05.971
(heavy breathing)

32:21.854 --> 32:24.020
(distant sirens)

32:32.363 --> 32:34.596
(heart monitor beeps)

32:42.906 --> 32:45.106
(whoosh)

32:56.985 --> 33:00.652
(loud fluttering)
(indistinct, foreign whispering)

33:00.654 --> 33:02.720
- Master.

33:02.722 --> 33:04.755
You are here.

33:04.757 --> 33:08.325
(hissing and whispering)

33:11.296 --> 33:13.529
(reptilian purring)

33:16.634 --> 33:20.035
(snorting)

33:31.481 --> 33:35.115
- Eldritch, what's happening?

33:35.117 --> 33:37.617
- You are being saved.

33:37.619 --> 33:39.885
(snarling)

33:43.456 --> 33:46.590
- Oh, my God.

33:46.592 --> 33:48.592
Was that...

33:48.594 --> 33:50.594
Bolivar? What did he do to me?

33:50.596 --> 33:54.430
- That was the Master.

33:54.432 --> 33:57.366
I am his partner.

33:57.368 --> 33:59.668
- The Master?

33:59.670 --> 34:01.770
- There is so much to tell you.

34:01.772 --> 34:04.672
I hated lying to you.

34:04.674 --> 34:07.374
But now you have experienced

34:07.376 --> 34:11.010
His power for yourself.
- What are you talking about?

34:11.012 --> 34:14.780
- Coco, I helped Him because
I wanted Him to save my life.

34:14.782 --> 34:17.115
And He did. And now

34:17.117 --> 34:19.617
He has saved your life too.

34:29.528 --> 34:31.961
(faint police radio)

34:39.069 --> 34:42.636
- Pretty soon I'm just
gonna be eating gum.

34:42.638 --> 34:46.006
(distant crash)

34:46.008 --> 34:49.876
- I'll go check it out.

34:53.714 --> 34:57.148
(low hissing)

34:57.150 --> 35:00.084
(distant crashing)
Holy shit!

35:00.086 --> 35:03.487
- (man): What's going on?
(distant gunshots)

35:03.489 --> 35:05.689
(distant shattering)

35:05.691 --> 35:08.992
(more gunshots)

35:08.994 --> 35:12.295
(growling)
Oh, God!

35:17.167 --> 35:19.033
- (man): Behind you!

35:19.035 --> 35:21.902
- (other man): They're all over
the place!

35:21.904 --> 35:24.504
(gunshots)
(creatures snarling)

35:24.506 --> 35:27.440
(creatures screeching)

35:27.442 --> 35:30.109
(creatures sucking and croaking)

35:30.111 --> 35:32.211
- Hey! Let me out!

35:32.213 --> 35:34.746
I can help you!

35:38.517 --> 35:40.950
Thank you.

35:40.952 --> 35:43.886
You gotta be kidding me.
- Shut up.

35:43.888 --> 35:47.422
(snarling)

35:53.796 --> 35:57.097
(growling)

35:57.099 --> 35:59.699
(creatures screaming)
(whipping sounds)

35:59.701 --> 36:02.535
(growling)

36:10.110 --> 36:13.043
(gun clicking)

36:14.880 --> 36:18.514
(policeman crying out)

36:21.819 --> 36:25.053
(creatures screaming)

36:25.055 --> 36:29.223
(man grunting)

36:31.727 --> 36:33.626
(sizzling)

36:33.628 --> 36:36.061
- You okay?

36:36.063 --> 36:38.329
- Where's Dutch?

36:38.331 --> 36:40.397
- They dragged her out
of here hours ago.

36:40.399 --> 36:44.434
They didn't tell me anything.
(keys clinking)

36:44.436 --> 36:47.470
- Dutch! Dutch!

36:47.472 --> 36:51.707
- Jesus Christ!

36:56.446 --> 36:58.646
- We're getting out of here.
I suggest you do the same.

36:58.648 --> 37:00.648
Now, tell us: where's Dutch?

37:00.650 --> 37:04.217
- Where?

37:06.287 --> 37:09.788
- My buddy, Reynalds, took her. He was
supposed to deliver her someplace.

37:09.790 --> 37:13.091
- Where?

37:13.093 --> 37:16.227
- Mayfield Hotel.

37:19.665 --> 37:21.865
(sirens)

37:33.344 --> 37:35.844
(car honking)

37:41.484 --> 37:46.119
(distant men yelling)

38:07.208 --> 38:09.441
(sigh)

38:26.726 --> 38:28.959
- What have you done with it?!

38:32.097 --> 38:35.264
(grunting)
(sword swooshing)

38:35.266 --> 38:37.766
(sword clattering)

38:43.105 --> 38:46.739
