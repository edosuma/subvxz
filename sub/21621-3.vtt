00:06.406 --> 00:07.608
Hi, Metallica.

00:08.308 --> 00:09.843
Hi, Billy!

00:09.910 --> 00:11.745
-How you doin'?
-Ah...

00:11.812 --> 00:13.680
I've very excited to be
in the car with you.

00:13.747 --> 00:15.682
I never thought I'd be in a car
with Metallica.

00:15.749 --> 00:17.918
-Oh, come on, really?
-It's true.

00:17.985 --> 00:20.387
I never thought I'd be in a car again
with James Hetfield driving.

00:21.855 --> 00:24.558
I think the last time
was about 25 years ago.

00:24.625 --> 00:27.694
-You don't drive?
-We ended up in jail somehow.

00:27.761 --> 00:29.096
-Is that true?
-I was arrested

00:29.162 --> 00:31.298
for destruction of property in London.

00:31.365 --> 00:34.368
The first time I was in jail,
I'd just moved over from Denmark.

00:34.434 --> 00:36.003
I've been in jail three different times.

00:36.103 --> 00:39.640
-You guys have gotten arrested a lot.
-You never been arrested? What's wrong?

00:39.706 --> 00:43.177
I was arrested for indecent exposure
at a performance of The Lion King.

00:51.118 --> 00:52.686
I'm in Metallica now!

00:53.754 --> 00:54.721
That's right.

00:54.788 --> 00:56.490
Yeah!

01:04.697 --> 01:06.066
Turn it up!

01:22.516 --> 01:23.784
Come on, everybody!

01:25.152 --> 01:26.854
Why am I the only one singing?

01:48.108 --> 01:50.310
CARPOOL KARAOKE

01:57.851 --> 02:00.821
So, what inspired "Enter Sandman"?

02:00.888 --> 02:03.090
It was about crib death
in the beginning.

02:03.156 --> 02:08.228
Really? Kelly Clarkson has a great song
about crib death that I love.

02:09.795 --> 02:11.632
Oh, Metallica and I
are getting along great.

02:12.266 --> 02:15.135
If you guys are up for it,
since we don't really know each other,

02:15.202 --> 02:17.704
I thought we could play a game,
you up for that?

02:17.771 --> 02:19.306
-Sure.
-All right, great.

02:19.373 --> 02:22.943
It's kind of a take on the classic game
"Never have I ever",

02:23.076 --> 02:25.112
but it's called "Metal have I ever".

02:25.179 --> 02:28.115
It's just like "Never have I ever",
but instead of holding up five fingers,

02:28.182 --> 02:31.351
you're just gonna hold up metal fingers,
you understand?

02:33.620 --> 02:35.222
OK, so here we go.

02:37.491 --> 02:41.094
Metal have I ever listened
to Paula Cole to unwind?

02:42.496 --> 02:44.898
-Who's Paula Cole?
-Who's Paula Cole?

02:44.965 --> 02:47.100
-Sorry.
-You didn't watch Dawson's Creek?

02:48.101 --> 02:50.103
You have to know the song, though.
That's like...

02:53.974 --> 02:57.110
-I remember that song.
-Yeah, it's a big hit, yeah.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.446
-Thank you.
-We're gonna let you out right here.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.581
OK.

03:02.082 --> 03:06.153
All right, here we go.
Metal have I ever sent a d*** pic?

03:11.058 --> 03:12.259
Yes!

03:13.260 --> 03:15.295
-No? No d*** pics.
-No d*** pics.

03:15.762 --> 03:18.265
You didn't get the one I sent you? Aww!

03:18.332 --> 03:21.368
-I could never get the lighting right.
-I didn't say I never received one.

03:21.435 --> 03:24.805
OK. Metal have I ever been excited
about a new flavour of yogurt?

03:24.872 --> 03:28.175
-Are you guys yogurt people?
-I love frozen yogurt.

03:28.242 --> 03:31.111
-Oh, OK, frozen yogurt. There we go.
-Frozen yogurt, all right.

03:31.178 --> 03:33.614
Frozen yogurt.
Metallica loves fro-yo.

03:33.680 --> 03:36.483
What kind of toppings do you guys
like on your fro-yo?

03:36.550 --> 03:38.185
-Dirt.
-Tar.

03:38.252 --> 03:39.520
Just piss.

03:39.586 --> 03:42.623
I just get frozen yogurt
and I piss all over it.

03:42.689 --> 03:43.657
Dirt and piss.

03:44.658 --> 03:48.529
Have you ever sang the Jasmine part
in "A Whole New World",

03:48.595 --> 03:49.897
the song from Aladdin?

03:51.431 --> 03:52.432
No?

03:52.499 --> 03:54.701
Well, I loved The Little Mermaid.

03:54.768 --> 03:57.437
I like musicals.
I was a musical theatre student.

03:57.504 --> 04:00.641
And I thought it would be fun
if we could sing a Disney song

04:00.707 --> 04:01.875
from The Little Mermaid.

04:01.942 --> 04:06.313
You know, the mermaid is singing
about how she wants to be on land.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.882
You know, she wants to be like
a real human being.

04:08.949 --> 04:12.085
So, it's a lot like
"Master of Puppets" in a way.

04:12.152 --> 04:15.088
So, all right, let's do this.
Here we go.

04:15.822 --> 04:16.822
-Shh!
-Let's do trivia.

04:21.295 --> 04:22.596
Who's singing?

04:25.299 --> 04:28.335
-He takes this really seriously.
-Yeah. Apparently.

04:29.837 --> 04:32.072
-I thought this--
-I'm singing!

04:33.073 --> 04:34.842
People sold this to us as a Metallica...

04:34.908 --> 04:37.177
-Let him sing.
-When's the riff?

04:37.244 --> 04:38.579
Shh!

04:40.681 --> 04:42.082
Is there a drummer in this band?

04:43.083 --> 04:44.551
Where is the guitar solo?

04:44.618 --> 04:45.485
There's no bass.

04:48.088 --> 04:48.822
Yes!

05:00.267 --> 05:02.402
-It is like "Master of Puppets".
-Shh!

05:02.469 --> 05:04.104
Shh! This is the quiet part.

05:25.058 --> 05:27.494
F***** Little Mermaid works every time.

05:27.561 --> 05:28.729
Yeah.

05:31.765 --> 05:33.333
Kinda gets you, huh, buddy?

05:42.342 --> 05:45.412
All right, hey, this is another song
I love from The Little Mermaid.

05:45.479 --> 05:48.982
It's also on your new album.
It's called "Now That We're Dead".

05:49.082 --> 05:53.120
You guys have a lot of songs
about dying and people dying.

05:53.187 --> 05:54.388
Long live death.

05:54.454 --> 05:56.256
Have you ever written a song
that's just about

05:56.323 --> 05:59.860
like going out like a farmer's market
and having a nice time?

06:00.561 --> 06:01.762
Farmer's market?

06:01.828 --> 06:06.733
The next Metallica album should be called:
"Farmers Market: Organic Fruits!"

06:06.800 --> 06:08.135
That'd be good.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.402
-Ah, here it comes.
-Guitar solo.

06:42.469 --> 06:44.271
How long is this solo gonna last?

06:44.338 --> 06:45.572
-Ya-ha!
-All right.

06:57.718 --> 06:59.987
I'm gonna check my email!

07:03.857 --> 07:05.292
No, you're not!

07:05.359 --> 07:08.228
Oh, s***! Whoa! Whoa!

07:12.666 --> 07:14.935
I'm on Twitter now

07:15.035 --> 07:16.703
What the hell

07:16.770 --> 07:19.940
Andy Richter just tweeted about Trump

07:20.440 --> 07:23.043
Who who who is that?

07:23.110 --> 07:26.380
Andy Richter is
The sidekick on Conan

07:26.446 --> 07:28.649
-Of course, I shoulda known that
-Yeah!

07:43.764 --> 07:46.567
Let me ask you something: I'm known
for screaming at people on the street,

07:46.633 --> 07:49.203
and people always ask me
if I lose my voice.

07:49.269 --> 07:52.840
Do you ever lose your voice?
Like how do you keep your voice in shape?

07:52.906 --> 07:55.442
-That's a tough song to sing live.
-Ah, yeah.

07:55.509 --> 08:00.447
I just sing crappy all the time, so...
if it's bad, it's bad...

08:00.514 --> 08:01.882
if it's good, it's... less bad.

08:43.457 --> 08:46.059
-Have you ever been addicted to crack?
-No.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.695
-I hate that.
-Yeah.

08:48.762 --> 08:50.130
This about crack?

08:51.064 --> 08:54.835
It's about being addicted to anything,
where you're like ruled by something.

08:55.602 --> 08:56.770
Ever been ruled by something?

08:58.539 --> 09:02.142
Um... I like pop culture a lot.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.378
So pop culture rules you.

09:04.444 --> 09:07.014
-Yeah, that's probably true.
-You have an addiction to pop culture?

09:07.080 --> 09:10.884
-Maybe a little. It's probably unhealthy.
-You think?

09:12.619 --> 09:14.154
What would be a healthier addiction?

09:16.456 --> 09:18.125
Yogurt?

09:18.892 --> 09:21.728
Oh, my God, wait.
Is that Sean Hayes?

09:22.696 --> 09:24.765
-Hey!
-Whoa, hold on!

09:24.831 --> 09:26.934
-Are you Sean Hayes?
-Sean!

09:27.568 --> 09:29.036
Is that Sean?

09:29.102 --> 09:31.371
-Sean Hayes.
-It's Billy Eichner!

09:32.539 --> 09:33.740
That's not Sean Hayes?

09:35.509 --> 09:37.678
-I think it is!
-Who's Sean Hayes?

09:37.744 --> 09:39.680
I'm telling you it is.
Who's Sean Hayes?

09:39.746 --> 09:41.515
Metallica did not watch Will &amp; Grace.

09:47.955 --> 09:50.724
All right, guys, so we sang
a bunch of your songs.

09:50.791 --> 09:54.161
Now, if you don't mind,
I'd like to maybe sing

09:54.228 --> 09:57.164
something that I listen to
more frequently, if that's cool.

09:57.231 --> 09:59.433
-Are we there yet?
-Do you guys like any pop music?

09:59.499 --> 10:02.669
I don't really listen to pop music
'cause it makes me angry.

10:02.736 --> 10:07.074
-Do you guys like Beyoncé?
-How can you not like Beyoncé?

10:07.074 --> 10:10.210
That's the right answer,
because her fans will come after you.

10:10.277 --> 10:13.280
-Um, just say you love Beyoncé!
-Of course.

10:13.347 --> 10:15.516
What about Rihanna?
I heard you guys...

10:15.582 --> 10:18.986
We played a show with her
at Global Citizen in Central Park

10:19.086 --> 10:20.320
in September.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.723
-I went and saw her, she was awesome.
-She's fantastic.

10:22.789 --> 10:25.659
-A lot of energy, great band.
-Really good band, yeah.

10:25.726 --> 10:26.760
Well...

10:57.124 --> 10:59.359
Help me, help me.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.269
-Everybody!
-Head banging part!

11:10.270 --> 11:11.438
Yeah, head banging!

11:12.973 --> 11:13.974
Come on, Metallica.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.081
It's not that hard.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.859
And on head banging!

11:39.867 --> 11:41.535
Yeah!

11:41.602 --> 11:44.738
That was Rihanna, that's
the definitive version of that song!

11:48.342 --> 11:49.710
What was your first concert?

11:49.776 --> 11:54.548
My first concert was, ironically,
a band called Jethro Tull.

11:54.615 --> 11:57.284
Oh, yeah. Why is that ironic?

11:57.351 --> 11:59.186
'Cause they won a Grammy
for best metal...

11:59.253 --> 12:02.656
Over you guys, and that was a big
controversial thing, I remember that.

12:02.723 --> 12:05.125
It was the first year they brought metal
into the Grammys.

12:05.192 --> 12:06.527
That's amazing.

12:06.593 --> 12:09.162
I'm trying to erase that from my memory,
but it doesn't work.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.865
My first concert was Tina Turner.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.200
-Oh, cool.
-Hey, all right.

12:21.542 --> 12:22.476
Yeah.

12:25.879 --> 12:29.616
You're all gonna die
And everyone is f*****!

12:31.618 --> 12:32.686
You're getting it!

12:32.753 --> 12:34.755
Now I'm getting into
the Metallica frame of mind.

12:34.821 --> 12:35.822
You're getting it, see?

12:41.628 --> 12:44.364
All right, I was thinking,
this is an idea that I had.

12:44.431 --> 12:48.502
"Enter Sandman" is like the biggest
pump-up song of all time.

12:48.569 --> 12:51.138
People hear that,
they just get so pumped up,

12:51.205 --> 12:52.406
no matter what you're doing.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.541
I'm known for going up to people
on the street

12:54.608 --> 12:56.743
when they're just going
about their everyday lives

12:56.810 --> 13:00.714
and talking to them, so I thought maybe
we could combine our strengths,

13:00.781 --> 13:04.885
join forces, and I thought maybe we'd go
to a supermarket here

13:04.952 --> 13:08.889
and I could go up to the people and see
if they need to be pumped up

13:08.956 --> 13:12.893
while they're shopping for groceries
and then you can sing a song for them.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.595
-Awesome.
-Here we go.

13:25.739 --> 13:27.307
All right, let's go, Metallica.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.911
Here we go, let's go this way.
Let's go this way.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.349
Let's go, let's find someone.

13:35.415 --> 13:38.452
Come on, Metallica.
Looking for some shoppers.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.521
Miss, what's your name?

13:40.587 --> 13:43.390
-Kelly.
-Kelly! Kelly, what are you buying today?

13:43.457 --> 13:45.158
Chicken and asparagus.

13:45.225 --> 13:46.860
-What are you buying today?
-I don't know.

13:46.927 --> 13:49.096
Either avocado roll
or brown rice veggie roll.

13:49.129 --> 13:50.364
What are you doing here?

13:50.430 --> 13:52.332
Meat department.
Cutting meat, all day, every day.

13:52.399 --> 13:54.701
Cutting meat? Need to be pumped up
while you buy chicken?

13:54.768 --> 13:56.603
-Yes.
-Need to be pumped up

13:56.670 --> 13:58.305
-while you buy your avocado roll?
-Oh, yeah!

13:58.372 --> 14:01.041
-Need to be pumped up while you cut meat?
-You know it, baby!

14:01.108 --> 14:02.743
Yeah, let's hear it. This is Metallica!

14:02.809 --> 14:04.211
Yeah!

14:04.278 --> 14:08.215
Cut some meat!
Cut some meat!

14:11.218 --> 14:13.287
-Yeah!
-Hey hey hey hey!

14:13.353 --> 14:15.289
Here we go, Kelly.
Yeah, we're gonna...

14:15.355 --> 14:18.125
Yeah, it's party time!

14:18.192 --> 14:19.927
All that's kosher, that's good.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.562
Here's some f***** shrimp!

14:21.628 --> 14:23.263
Yeah!

14:23.330 --> 14:25.499
-Whoo!
-Are you getting pumped up?

14:25.566 --> 14:26.867
-Yeah!
-Yes!

14:26.934 --> 14:28.068
-Yeah!
-Oh!

14:31.905 --> 14:32.906
Yeah, let's hear it!

14:32.973 --> 14:35.809
Cut some meat!

14:35.876 --> 14:37.444
I know some of the words.

14:37.511 --> 14:40.480
-Cut some more meat!
-Yeah, go!

14:42.850 --> 14:45.152
Yeah! Yeah!

14:45.219 --> 14:46.920
Let's go, Metallica.

14:48.722 --> 14:50.390
Let's go, Metallica.

14:51.091 --> 14:54.595
-Whoo!
-All right.

14:54.661 --> 14:56.530
What's your favourite part
about working here?

14:56.597 --> 14:59.099
Oh, I decorate the store.

14:59.132 --> 15:00.801
-She decorates!
-Yeah!

15:00.868 --> 15:02.503
-Yeah!
-Here you go!

15:02.569 --> 15:04.137
Oh, yeah!

15:04.204 --> 15:06.440
Oh, yeah!

15:06.507 --> 15:09.710
Here's some, here's some...
here's some f**** radish!

15:09.776 --> 15:11.378
Enjoy that salad, b****!

15:11.445 --> 15:13.714
-Yeah, let's go, Metallica.
-Yeah!

15:15.649 --> 15:17.518
Yeah, sing it! Sing it!

15:17.584 --> 15:19.686
Into night

15:19.753 --> 15:21.388
Oh, it's "enter night", but OK.

15:21.455 --> 15:25.058
All right. Are you pumped up?!

15:27.094 --> 15:29.429
Yes, all right! All right!

15:29.496 --> 15:32.065
-Enjoy that sausage!
-All right!

15:34.401 --> 15:36.503
All right, guys, we did it.
Thank you so much.

15:36.570 --> 15:38.539
-That was fun.
-Got people way pumped up.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.741
We pumped people up,
we had a great ride.

15:40.807 --> 15:44.511
And thank you, we didn't know each other,
but I think we've bonded now.

15:45.245 --> 15:48.515
-I feel like I've known you all my life.
-Yeah, we're friends.

15:48.582 --> 15:50.851
The one thing I want
that hasn't happened yet,

15:50.918 --> 15:54.221
I would love to know what it feels like
to be in a Metallica group hug.

15:54.288 --> 15:55.689
What do you say?

15:56.290 --> 15:57.658
-Join our circle.
-Let's do it!

15:57.724 --> 15:59.293
Come on, Metallica! OK.

15:59.359 --> 16:00.694
-Join our circle.
-Come on, oh!
