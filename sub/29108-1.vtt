01:58.553 --> 02:00.729
- Mami?
- Hmm?

02:00.772 --> 02:04.254
You're not cooking for an entire army.
Come sit with us.

02:04.298 --> 02:06.126
You're right.

02:07.736 --> 02:09.564
It's an old habit.

02:09.607 --> 02:11.740
When my husband was alive,

02:11.783 --> 02:14.525
he had a cattle farm
right across the lake,

02:14.569 --> 02:16.875
on the Mexico side
of the border.

02:16.919 --> 02:18.399
I would cook...

02:18.442 --> 02:20.444
lunch and dinner...

02:20.488 --> 02:22.316
for him and his workers.

02:22.359 --> 02:24.579
It was like an army.

02:26.624 --> 02:29.192
You still have
that cattle farm?

02:29.236 --> 02:30.672
No.

02:30.715 --> 02:33.370
I'm sure your life
is much more exciting.

02:35.242 --> 02:37.505
Exciting, yes. Though...

02:37.548 --> 02:39.333
most times
I wish it were boring.

02:41.465 --> 02:43.859
Why would you say that?

02:43.902 --> 02:46.209
I would love to have
an exciting life.

02:46.253 --> 02:48.559
Sometimes the excitement
can be a good thing.

02:48.603 --> 02:49.821
But too much excitement...

02:51.083 --> 02:52.172
there are variables.

02:54.086 --> 02:56.872
Variables?
Like... like what?

02:58.961 --> 03:01.224
There are many ungrateful
people in my line of work.

03:01.268 --> 03:03.400
What type of work do you do?

03:03.444 --> 03:04.575
I'm like a...

03:06.055 --> 03:07.622
tour guide.

03:07.665 --> 03:09.406
That's weird!

03:09.450 --> 03:11.974
I mean, they signed up
for the tour, right?

03:12.017 --> 03:13.889
That's what I say.
I always warn them

03:13.932 --> 03:15.432
what type of trip
they're signing up for.

03:15.456 --> 03:17.414
But still they complain,

03:17.458 --> 03:19.460
want to turn around,
go home...

03:19.503 --> 03:21.157
They should go home.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.507
Don't spoil the trip
for everyone else.

03:23.551 --> 03:26.075
I wish it were that easy.

03:26.118 --> 03:27.118
So what do you do with them?

03:27.119 --> 03:29.992
Mija, please.

03:30.035 --> 03:32.429
Let him enjoy his food. Hmm?

03:34.126 --> 03:35.171
Sorry.

03:36.738 --> 03:37.956
I just...

03:39.044 --> 03:40.394
I wanna travel...

03:41.482 --> 03:43.048
I would love to be tourist.

03:43.092 --> 03:45.050
I'm saving money
to go somewhere.

03:48.663 --> 03:50.578
I was just like you
when I was younger.

03:50.621 --> 03:53.015
But take it from me...

03:53.058 --> 03:56.323
when you spend many years travelling
from place to place...

03:56.366 --> 03:57.498
you grow to miss your home.

04:02.894 --> 04:04.853
Can we offer you
anything else?

04:04.896 --> 04:06.681
How about some coffee?

04:06.724 --> 04:07.812
That sounds wonderful.

04:28.398 --> 04:29.921
It's taking forever.

04:31.009 --> 04:32.533
Be patient, hija.

04:37.581 --> 04:39.496
Do you like sugar
in your coffee?

04:47.504 --> 04:48.636
Mami?

05:41.036 --> 05:42.864
- Mami.
- Hmm?

05:42.907 --> 05:44.779
Found it.

05:44.822 --> 05:46.171
What do you think?

05:46.215 --> 05:47.869
Is he worth it?

05:50.001 --> 05:51.916
Yes.

05:51.960 --> 05:53.527
Very good, Ester.

06:00.490 --> 06:03.406
- Where's Dirk, Mama?
- I don't know.

06:03.450 --> 06:06.366
You know how he can be.

06:06.409 --> 06:09.020
- I'm gonna go find him.
- No, no, no...

06:09.064 --> 06:10.674
Let's wait until darker.

06:12.981 --> 06:14.374
What if he wakes up?

06:14.417 --> 06:17.812
He will not.
He drank the entire glass.

06:24.688 --> 06:27.169
Basket is ready.

08:24.765 --> 08:27.550
See? A peaceful death.

13:38.818 --> 13:39.818
What?

13:42.386 --> 13:43.605
What do you want, Dirk?

13:46.173 --> 13:48.218
Stop staring at me,
you freak.

13:57.401 --> 13:58.401
Wait!

13:59.403 --> 14:00.796
Wait! Wait!

14:06.236 --> 14:08.064
Wait! Wait.

14:10.632 --> 14:11.633
I have food for you.

14:20.033 --> 14:23.123
Uh, uh...
please, take it.

14:24.211 --> 14:25.211
Take it.

14:29.085 --> 14:30.086
I'm sorry.

14:43.534 --> 14:44.535
Sit down, mija.

14:56.199 --> 14:57.548
What happened?

14:59.463 --> 15:00.595
You gave them food?

15:05.208 --> 15:07.167
I'm not mad at you.

15:08.385 --> 15:09.952
Why couldn't they stay here?

15:11.998 --> 15:13.956
You know...

15:14.000 --> 15:16.959
they didn't have enough money
to make them worth it.

15:17.003 --> 15:19.788
And probably,
they don't deserve it.

15:19.831 --> 15:21.572
They seemed like good people.

15:22.878 --> 15:25.141
Exactly!

15:25.185 --> 15:28.797
So why couldn't we
just help them?

15:28.840 --> 15:30.190
One night.

15:30.233 --> 15:32.583
Some food. We could have
done that for them.

15:36.326 --> 15:37.675
Those poor people.

15:39.851 --> 15:41.766
Left for dead
by those coyotes,

15:41.810 --> 15:43.377
and the coyotes
we let in our house.

15:43.420 --> 15:45.988
Mm-hmm. Yes.

15:46.032 --> 15:50.471
And we give those coyotes
what they deserve.

15:50.514 --> 15:52.255
Hmm? Like Mario.

15:53.909 --> 15:56.129
He seemed nice, but...

15:56.172 --> 16:00.916
what do you think he meant
when he talked about tourists?

16:03.179 --> 16:04.833
Tourists.

16:09.055 --> 16:10.186
Still...

16:12.232 --> 16:13.450
we could have helped them.

16:19.804 --> 16:22.155
I heard you yelling at Dirk.

16:22.198 --> 16:23.939
Did he do something to you?

16:25.027 --> 16:26.027
No.

16:29.205 --> 16:30.205
I just...

16:31.773 --> 16:34.036
don't understand
why he has to stay here.

16:36.169 --> 16:38.432
He barely helps.
I can do what he does.

16:38.475 --> 16:39.781
Ai, mija.

16:42.958 --> 16:44.612
Do you keep him here
because...

16:46.962 --> 16:49.399
- you love him?
- No!

16:56.276 --> 16:58.060
Ester...

16:58.104 --> 17:00.671
as soon as we have the money,
we will leave...

17:00.715 --> 17:02.630
for good. Hmm?

17:02.673 --> 17:05.720
And I promise you,
I promise you...

17:07.548 --> 17:11.377
it will just be us.
No Dirk. Hmm?

18:45.254 --> 18:46.299
Yes.

18:50.303 --> 18:52.957
- I'm fine, thank you.
- What do you need?

18:53.001 --> 18:57.179
I need... my mom's medicine.

18:57.223 --> 18:59.573
And another bottle
of the sleeping pills

18:59.616 --> 19:02.880
and the muscle relaxants.

19:02.924 --> 19:05.883
Pero, you took a bottle of
those pills not too long ago.

19:05.927 --> 19:08.799
- You must be careful, Ester.
- I know, I know.

19:08.843 --> 19:11.280
My... my mom,
she misplaced them.

19:11.324 --> 19:14.936
And she's in so much pain,
she can't even sleep without them.

19:14.979 --> 19:16.372
- I'm sorry.
- Just be careful.

19:16.416 --> 19:19.070
Maybe this time
you hold on to them

19:19.114 --> 19:21.595
so she does not get them lost.

19:21.638 --> 19:23.379
- Right?
- Yeah, yeah, I'll try.

19:29.951 --> 19:31.474
What size are you, Ester?

19:31.518 --> 19:33.128
Excuse me?

19:33.172 --> 19:37.132
Pretty girl like you
wearing the boy clothes?

19:37.176 --> 19:38.916
You hide behind those shirts.

19:40.004 --> 19:42.050
You need to wear a pretty dress.

19:42.093 --> 19:45.096
- DoÃ±a Rosa, really, it's OK!
- Ya, Ester.

20:07.510 --> 20:09.947
Mija...

20:09.991 --> 20:11.862
don't be scared, eh?

20:11.906 --> 20:14.822
Just stay out of their way.

20:14.865 --> 20:16.737
Now take this bag.

20:16.780 --> 20:19.479
Promise me you'll wear them.

20:21.307 --> 20:23.309
And make sure your mother
doesn't lose those pills.

20:23.352 --> 20:24.352
I will.

21:23.847 --> 21:25.458
Where did you leave the truck?

21:28.504 --> 21:29.504
Far away?

21:31.812 --> 21:33.161
Take a shower.

21:33.204 --> 21:35.729
Tonight,
you can come to my room.

21:35.772 --> 21:37.121
Hmm?

23:19.528 --> 23:22.749
You have to do this.
Yes, show me.

23:24.794 --> 23:27.362
OK... OK, be careful.

23:52.343 --> 23:54.911
- Hello.
- Hello.

23:54.955 --> 23:58.480
Would you happen to have
a room available for tonight?

24:02.615 --> 24:04.355
Yeah. Come in.

24:18.457 --> 24:19.458
Sir?

24:23.244 --> 24:25.594
Sir, I brought you
some Jamaicawater.

24:28.945 --> 24:29.990
Thank you.

25:28.831 --> 25:32.008
Miss, Miss, Miss.
You... You need to help us.

25:32.052 --> 25:34.794
I'm sorry. We don't have
any rooms available.

25:34.837 --> 25:37.207
Listen, listen. My friend's
in the car and he's... he's badly hurt.

25:37.231 --> 25:38.513
- Please...
- I can't help you, I'm sorry.

25:38.537 --> 25:39.581
Listen, all right? Look.

25:39.625 --> 25:40.689
He... he's been shot, all right?

25:40.713 --> 25:42.323
There's a hospital.

25:42.366 --> 25:45.848
Look, OK?
I'm not giving you a choice.

25:45.892 --> 25:47.807
Now, come down here, come on.

25:47.850 --> 25:50.026
- Faster, faster, to the truck.
- OK, OK.

25:50.070 --> 25:51.593
- Ester?
- Hey!

25:51.637 --> 25:53.464
- Mami!
- You, walk towards me. Come on.

25:53.508 --> 25:56.032
- Is anybody else in the house?
- We have a guest inside.

25:56.076 --> 25:59.819
He will not awake.
He had a lot to drink.

26:01.690 --> 26:04.171
You. You.
Down... down here. Come.

26:05.433 --> 26:07.783
Hurry. Go with her.

26:07.827 --> 26:10.090
Get to the car
and help my friend out of there.

26:13.093 --> 26:15.356
Give him some tequila.

26:15.399 --> 26:16.966
In the cabinet.

26:23.973 --> 26:25.584
He needs to go to the hospital.

26:25.627 --> 26:27.542
Enough about the hospital,
it's not an option.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.867
Get out of the way and let your
mom take care of it. Move!

26:31.720 --> 26:34.505
Give me the tequila!

26:35.855 --> 26:37.552
Hold him. Hold him.

26:37.596 --> 26:40.381
OK, all right. Hurry up!

26:40.424 --> 26:42.383
OK, OK, two more minutes.

26:54.743 --> 26:56.440
OK. It's OK.

27:13.719 --> 27:17.244
What was that? Huh?

27:23.163 --> 27:25.121
Who is that?

27:25.165 --> 27:27.080
- Answer me.
- It's Dirk.

27:27.123 --> 27:29.560
What? You told me
the guest wouldn't wake up.

27:29.604 --> 27:32.302
Dirk works here.

27:32.346 --> 27:34.174
The guest is still sleeping.

27:35.523 --> 27:37.699
- You fucking lied to me?
- No.

27:37.743 --> 27:40.136
No. You asked
who was in the house.

27:40.180 --> 27:42.922
- He wasn't in the house.
- Don't get smart with me, OK?

27:44.314 --> 27:45.751
- Just listen...
- Don't move.

27:45.794 --> 27:47.187
No, no, no, mija, no!

27:52.018 --> 27:53.018
Call him.

27:56.022 --> 27:59.155
Dirk, the kitchen.

28:00.766 --> 28:02.028
Shh! OK.

28:04.726 --> 28:05.988
Hey.

28:09.949 --> 28:12.821
Move, move. Don't move, OK?

28:13.996 --> 28:15.302
Is anybody else gonna show up?

28:15.345 --> 28:17.260
No, no. Only the guest.

28:17.304 --> 28:19.785
Nobody else lives here.
We rent rooms

28:19.828 --> 28:21.917
but it's rare for us
to have guests.

28:25.051 --> 28:27.096
Come here, move.

28:27.140 --> 28:28.924
Don't move, stay there.

28:36.845 --> 28:38.455
All right, over there.

28:41.807 --> 28:43.983
Turn around. Turn around.

28:45.071 --> 28:48.552
OK, OK, OK...

28:48.596 --> 28:51.555
Everyone give me their cell
phones. Right now, come on.

28:56.082 --> 28:58.214
Is that it?

29:01.043 --> 29:02.479
Fine.

29:04.568 --> 29:07.528
Now I want to check the rest
of the house, all of the rooms.

29:09.138 --> 29:10.444
All right?

29:12.663 --> 29:15.492
You and you,
you're coming with me.

29:18.452 --> 29:22.282
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Yeah, OK, OK.

29:33.859 --> 29:35.643
Move it, move it.

29:38.385 --> 29:42.041
- All right, now that one.
- No, no, that's the guest room.

29:42.084 --> 29:45.392
- So what?
- What if we wake him up?

29:45.435 --> 29:47.524
Open the damn door!

29:47.568 --> 29:50.658
- OK, open the door.
- Come on.

29:52.486 --> 29:55.097
Let's go.

29:55.141 --> 29:57.404
OK, OK, OK. OK.

29:59.493 --> 30:02.713
- Is this is the only guest?
- Yes, it's the only one.

30:04.803 --> 30:05.847
What a mess.

30:24.431 --> 30:27.173
We have to do something
about the guest.

30:27.216 --> 30:28.870
What?

30:28.914 --> 30:30.306
His room is a mess.

30:30.350 --> 30:33.483
If he wakes up,
he will know everything.

30:33.527 --> 30:35.703
He could put us in danger.

30:38.271 --> 30:39.402
Move it.

30:43.929 --> 30:45.191
You, over there.

30:46.932 --> 30:48.368
Get in that room.

30:48.411 --> 30:51.937
- That's not my room.
- I don't care.

30:51.980 --> 30:54.765
Listen up. I'm going
to be up all night,

30:54.809 --> 30:57.029
so don't do anything smart,
because I will hear you,

30:57.072 --> 30:59.248
and if I do, I'll shoot you.

30:59.292 --> 31:00.292
OK?

31:01.947 --> 31:03.122
Go.

31:07.604 --> 31:10.259
You... over there.
Come on.

32:55.321 --> 32:57.671
Sir, please,
you need to be quiet.

32:59.368 --> 33:02.415
There are men in the house.
Men with guns.

33:02.458 --> 33:05.026
If you cause a scene, they'll
come in and shoot us both. So...

33:06.158 --> 33:08.464
Shh!

33:08.508 --> 33:12.033
Shh! Shh! Shh!

33:12.077 --> 33:15.950
Just listen to me...

33:18.387 --> 33:19.998
- No!
- Get up.

33:24.176 --> 33:26.004
You drugged me!

33:44.457 --> 33:47.373
Are you OK? What happened?

33:47.416 --> 33:49.462
Hey, hey, hey,
what happened?

33:49.505 --> 33:52.900
I... I heard sounds
from my room.

33:52.943 --> 33:55.859
And then I thought
he was sick, so I came in.

33:57.296 --> 33:58.688
And he attacked me.

34:01.256 --> 34:02.736
We have to...

34:05.304 --> 34:09.482
Come on. Come on, come on.
We need to go. Let's go.

34:18.578 --> 34:19.927
Get me a shovel.

34:56.659 --> 34:58.835
Grab his arm. Come on.

35:02.796 --> 35:04.450
Help me move him. Come on.

35:18.159 --> 35:19.159
Here.

35:20.770 --> 35:21.771
Start digging.

35:22.859 --> 35:23.904
This way.

35:25.210 --> 35:26.254
Here?

35:27.386 --> 35:28.387
Yeah.

35:33.740 --> 35:36.438
No, you have to...
you have to

35:36.482 --> 35:38.223
plant the blade
into the ground.

35:38.266 --> 35:39.266
I am.

35:40.312 --> 35:41.617
Use your feet.

35:45.926 --> 35:48.320
No, no, here. I got it.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.893
I think he's waking up.

36:03.944 --> 36:05.163
Go back to the house.

36:10.690 --> 36:12.126
You don't wanna see this.

36:14.389 --> 36:15.390
Go.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.181
I told you
to stay in your room.

37:52.531 --> 37:53.531
Sorry...

37:55.185 --> 37:56.578
I couldn't sleep.

38:00.365 --> 38:01.366
I'm hungry.

38:02.454 --> 38:03.629
Aren't you?

38:11.419 --> 38:12.594
Yeah.

38:15.597 --> 38:17.947
I could make us
some breakfast.

38:19.209 --> 38:20.646
OK.

38:29.568 --> 38:31.352
Get the fuck... Get out.

38:31.396 --> 38:33.136
Get out!

38:35.878 --> 38:37.445
What do you think
you're doing?

38:37.489 --> 38:38.689
- What was that?
- I...

38:40.187 --> 38:41.884
I-I think...

38:41.928 --> 38:43.669
Dirk was just
getting rid of the car.

38:43.712 --> 38:45.975
That was the guest's car.
That's smart, right?

38:46.019 --> 38:47.803
We should probably
get rid of it.

38:47.847 --> 38:50.371
Hide any evidence.

38:50.415 --> 38:53.069
You all need to stop making
your own damn decisions, OK?

38:58.074 --> 38:59.641
What's the problem
with the retard?

39:01.600 --> 39:04.951
- What?
- That guy.

39:04.994 --> 39:08.694
Dirk. He just stood there
like a zombie last night.

39:08.737 --> 39:12.567
But this morning he's, what,
all of a sudden a crime expert?

39:12.611 --> 39:14.874
He's got some sort of
mental problem, right?

39:18.138 --> 39:19.966
Maybe.

39:20.009 --> 39:21.707
If my house had been
under attack,

39:21.750 --> 39:22.750
I'd stand up to the guys.

39:24.884 --> 39:27.147
So we're under attack?

39:27.190 --> 39:28.583
You know what I mean.

39:34.328 --> 39:35.677
I don't care much
for him either.

39:38.941 --> 39:41.074
You and your mom need
a real man to protect you.

39:41.117 --> 39:43.555
- You mean a man like you?
- What about him?

39:50.039 --> 39:52.215
I was just saying that...

39:52.259 --> 39:55.305
you two need a real man
to protect you.

39:55.349 --> 40:00.049
Don't worry. We manage just fine
without a man like you.

40:04.227 --> 40:06.012
Hurry up. I'm hungry.

40:13.889 --> 40:15.804
We need to find a moment
to take care of them.

40:18.720 --> 40:20.853
Why don't we just do
what we always do?

40:20.896 --> 40:22.594
They probably have
a lot of money.

40:22.637 --> 40:25.031
No. That's too risky.

40:26.119 --> 40:27.381
There are two of them.

40:28.948 --> 40:30.906
We never done two
at the same time.

40:39.393 --> 40:40.393
Then, what?

40:42.004 --> 40:45.181
I don't know. But just know,
mijita...

40:45.225 --> 40:47.488
just know...

40:47.532 --> 40:51.405
what he did last night,
he didn't do...

40:51.449 --> 40:53.233
out of a kindness.

40:53.276 --> 40:57.324
This type of people
don't have kindness in them.

40:57.367 --> 40:58.717
Trust me.

41:01.676 --> 41:02.676
Hmm?

41:53.206 --> 41:54.250
Paco.

42:53.658 --> 42:54.920
How is he?

42:54.963 --> 42:57.139
We need to get him
some medicine.

42:57.183 --> 42:59.620
- You're coming with me.
- No, no, no, no.

42:59.664 --> 43:02.188
No, you should take me instead.

43:02.231 --> 43:05.147
I'm in charge,
and we do as I say.

43:05.191 --> 43:07.802
We're taking your car,
so where are the keys?

43:10.457 --> 43:11.806
In the kitchen.

43:24.602 --> 43:25.994
Can you put that thing away?

43:27.692 --> 43:29.258
You and your mom are very bossy

43:29.302 --> 43:30.912
considering
I'm the one with the gun.

43:30.956 --> 43:32.914
I just don't want us
to hit a bump on the road

43:32.958 --> 43:35.118
and you accidentally shoot me
in the head or something.

43:37.832 --> 43:39.747
So what's your name?

43:39.791 --> 43:40.792
Paco.

43:42.054 --> 43:43.142
I'm Ester.

43:44.709 --> 43:47.625
Ester? That's...

43:47.668 --> 43:49.801
That's an ugly name.

43:49.844 --> 43:51.890
You're way too pretty
for a name like that.

44:02.422 --> 44:06.121
Ester, hola.
- Hola, DoÃ±a Rosa.

44:06.165 --> 44:07.427
Who is this?

44:09.734 --> 44:12.171
I'm Paco. Uh...

44:12.214 --> 44:13.781
Ester's boyfriend.

44:13.825 --> 44:15.653
Ahh.

44:15.696 --> 44:18.046
Is that why you're
acting so nervous?

44:18.090 --> 44:20.092
- Nice to meet you, Paco.
- Mucho gusto.

44:20.135 --> 44:21.702
You better take care
of this girl.

44:23.573 --> 44:25.837
Ester, how's your mother?

44:25.880 --> 44:27.534
I haven't seen you in a while.

44:27.577 --> 44:30.319
I'm sorry. It's...

44:30.363 --> 44:31.756
We've been really busy.

44:31.799 --> 44:33.714
Mm. Mm-hmm.

44:33.758 --> 44:36.456
- It's Dirk actually.
- Quehappened?

44:36.499 --> 44:38.327
Well, he was cutting wood,

44:38.371 --> 44:42.157
and the axe slipped
and sliced his leg open.

44:42.201 --> 44:44.856
He's gonna be OK, but we think
it's getting infected.

44:44.899 --> 44:46.727
What did the doctor say?

44:46.771 --> 44:49.208
He said we didn't really
do a good job cleaning it.

44:49.251 --> 44:51.689
But it's Dirk's fault.
He stayed outside, letting it bleed.

44:51.732 --> 44:54.474
He's such a silly man.

44:54.517 --> 44:56.171
He needs antibiotics.

44:57.607 --> 44:59.784
Sure, sure.

44:59.827 --> 45:02.003
And some painkillers.
He's in a lot of pain.

45:02.047 --> 45:03.396
Sure, sure.

45:10.011 --> 45:12.057
You don't need that now.

45:12.100 --> 45:14.581
- What?
- The gun.

45:14.624 --> 45:16.409
You trust your girlfriend,
don't you?

45:18.019 --> 45:19.151
What?

45:20.805 --> 45:22.284
I'm sorry,
that would never happen.

45:24.504 --> 45:27.507
My mom would never
let me date a gringa.

45:27.550 --> 45:29.988
That's not fair.
I'm half Mexican.

45:30.031 --> 45:31.990
You can't even speak Spanish.

45:32.033 --> 45:34.427
Well, neither could
Selena Quintanilla,

45:34.470 --> 45:38.039
but she learned it eventually,
and so will I.

45:38.083 --> 45:39.911
Besides, since when
is speaking Spanish

45:39.954 --> 45:41.477
a must to being Latina.

45:41.521 --> 45:45.003
Latina, or Chicana...

45:45.046 --> 45:46.874
Fresa...

45:46.918 --> 45:49.137
whatever, I...

45:49.181 --> 45:50.854
you've obviously
never been in a relationship

45:50.878 --> 45:53.359
if you think
couples always trust each other.

45:58.625 --> 46:00.105
You never had a boyfriend?

46:02.063 --> 46:05.675
- I'm not that type of girl.
- What type of girl is that?

46:05.719 --> 46:08.809
My mom says only dumb girls
when they're pregnant and alone

46:08.853 --> 46:10.332
have boyfriends this young.

46:11.943 --> 46:14.293
They end up either a stripper
or a prostitute.

46:14.336 --> 46:16.512
Do you believe your mom
when she...

46:16.556 --> 46:17.949
when she tells you those things?

46:21.039 --> 46:23.519
Is that why you wear
these boy clothes?

46:23.563 --> 46:25.391
'Cause of what your mom says?

46:36.402 --> 46:38.665
So why do you smuggle drugs?

46:40.972 --> 46:42.408
That's what you do, right?

46:42.451 --> 46:43.626
You two are drug dealers?

46:44.889 --> 46:45.890
What do you think?

46:48.675 --> 46:50.851
Why do you and your mom live
in that abandoned farm?

46:50.895 --> 46:53.419
We're saving up money.

46:53.462 --> 46:55.073
When we have enough,
we'll leave.

46:57.902 --> 47:01.209
I'd love to go somewhere,
you know,

47:01.253 --> 47:03.559
start a family...

47:03.603 --> 47:05.735
maybe by the beach.

47:05.779 --> 47:08.477
I wanna go to the beach, too.

47:08.521 --> 47:10.305
You should.

47:10.349 --> 47:13.526
Get away from all the bad shit
that happens around here.

47:22.143 --> 47:23.318
No.

48:18.156 --> 48:20.332
No?

48:40.613 --> 48:43.485
Mami...

48:43.529 --> 48:44.965
what do you wanna eat?

48:45.009 --> 48:47.837
Nothing.
I lost my appetite.

48:50.014 --> 48:51.841
He should be better tomorrow.

48:53.104 --> 48:54.148
I'll go check on him.

48:56.281 --> 48:57.586
Thanks for cooking.

49:01.939 --> 49:04.115
- Mami...
- Start cleaning the kitchen.

49:12.297 --> 49:14.255
What do you think
you are doing?

49:26.485 --> 49:28.182
Hey.

49:28.226 --> 49:29.662
What happened?

49:33.666 --> 49:35.494
Hey, hey.

49:35.537 --> 49:37.278
Your cheek's red.

49:37.322 --> 49:38.888
What happened?

49:42.675 --> 49:45.112
She didn't like my behavior
at dinner.

49:48.246 --> 49:50.683
She said I was acting
like a tramp.

49:52.728 --> 49:54.600
What? Why?

49:57.820 --> 49:59.866
She said I was...

50:01.346 --> 50:02.477
flirting with you.

50:05.959 --> 50:07.134
And she slapped you for that?

50:10.094 --> 50:11.617
Ester,

50:11.660 --> 50:14.054
just because she's your mom...

50:14.098 --> 50:16.535
doesn't mean she's allowed
to treat you like this.

50:19.886 --> 50:21.670
Please, just...

50:21.714 --> 50:23.629
She'll just hear us,
and she'll get angrier.

50:32.290 --> 50:34.944
Gracias.

51:09.849 --> 51:10.849
Sit.

51:11.851 --> 51:14.897
Hey, hey, thank you.

52:17.090 --> 52:19.136
What?

52:19.179 --> 52:21.834
- Your hair's down.
- So?

52:24.967 --> 52:26.752
You look very beautiful.

52:32.584 --> 52:34.325
Thank you.

52:46.728 --> 52:48.165
Take your shirt off.

52:52.386 --> 52:53.518
It's OK.

53:13.973 --> 53:14.973
What is this?

53:18.456 --> 53:19.805
Is this because of your mom?

53:36.822 --> 53:37.997
It's OK.

54:03.979 --> 54:05.503
Tell me you want me.

54:08.419 --> 54:10.986
- I want you.
- Promise me.

54:31.877 --> 54:35.533
- We need to be quiet.
- OK.

55:32.067 --> 55:33.591
Hey.

55:35.593 --> 55:39.292
I needed someone's help,
and I, uh...

55:39.336 --> 55:41.076
couldn't find Dirk.

56:00.313 --> 56:01.706
I should go clean the kitchen.

57:38.411 --> 57:40.065
- Ester...
- Sorry, Mami.

57:50.684 --> 57:52.512
Ester, hey.

57:52.556 --> 57:54.253
- What was that about?
- Nothing.

57:54.296 --> 57:58.475
Hey, come here. Talk to me.
What happened?

57:58.518 --> 58:01.347
She doesn't want me around you
when she's not there.

58:01.390 --> 58:05.830
She serious? You're not a child anymore.
Stop acting like one.

58:05.873 --> 58:08.354
I'm just being respectful
of my mother.

58:08.397 --> 58:10.835
Now, stop. She's gonna see us
or hear us together

58:10.878 --> 58:13.315
- and she'll be furious.
- Who cares? Come here.

58:17.624 --> 58:19.931
- We can't be in here.
- Why?

58:19.974 --> 58:21.822
Because it's my mother's room
and I'm not allowed in here.

58:21.846 --> 58:23.369
Nobody is.
She's gonna flip out.

58:26.590 --> 58:27.895
She just likes her privacy.

58:29.070 --> 58:30.070
Privacy?

58:34.162 --> 58:35.294
What are you doing?

58:40.865 --> 58:43.258
That's it? Some stupid pictures.

58:43.302 --> 58:46.087
- Don't.
- All she's doing is trying to control you.

58:46.131 --> 58:48.960
Think about it.
She home-schooled you.

58:49.003 --> 58:52.137
She didn't teach you Spanish.
All that does is isolate you.

58:52.180 --> 58:56.315
You got bandages around your chest,
all the crazy rules...

58:56.358 --> 58:59.840
I don't know why she does it,
but she's keeping you away from happiness.

58:59.884 --> 59:02.713
No, no, no, it's because she loves me.
She's just protecting me.

59:02.756 --> 59:05.063
That's not love, Ester.
You're young,

59:05.106 --> 59:07.258
and all you wanna do is get
out of here, and you should.

59:07.282 --> 59:09.546
She's just holding you back.

59:09.589 --> 59:11.199
No, she wants to move, too.

59:11.243 --> 59:13.898
We're saving up money
so we can move.

59:13.941 --> 59:15.943
You just need to go, Ester.

59:15.987 --> 59:19.077
This place is... it's trash.

59:19.120 --> 59:21.645
It drags you down, believe me.

59:21.688 --> 59:24.169
You have to get out of here
before it's too late.

59:24.212 --> 59:26.258
There are certain things
that once you get into...

59:27.694 --> 59:29.478
you can never get out of.

59:29.522 --> 59:33.091
But we need a lot of money
to... to start fresh.

59:33.134 --> 59:35.484
That's another lie, Ester.

59:35.528 --> 59:38.183
Sure, savings are great,
but... you'll get a job.

59:38.226 --> 59:39.488
It won't be easy at first,

59:39.532 --> 59:41.578
but anything
is better than this.

59:41.621 --> 59:43.841
it'll be worth it. Just... go.

59:46.017 --> 59:48.715
It's just a closet.

59:48.759 --> 59:51.196
People don't lock
their closet doors.

59:51.239 --> 59:55.461
Yeah, well, we have strangers
in our house all the time.

59:55.504 --> 59:58.203
Some strange man may come in,
snooping around.

59:58.246 --> 01:00:00.553
Your mom...

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:03.861
she's... she's hiding
something from you.

01:00:06.037 --> 01:00:08.474
- Why would she?
- I don't know.

01:00:08.517 --> 01:00:10.345
But when people wanna leave,
they just leave.

01:00:13.087 --> 01:00:14.654
Listen to me. Just go away.

01:00:15.742 --> 01:00:17.831
You can get a ride with us.

01:00:17.875 --> 01:00:20.138
I promise you, anything
will be better than this.

01:00:20.181 --> 01:00:22.096
And you deserve better.

01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:24.229
But you have to leave
this place to get it.

01:00:37.851 --> 01:00:39.331
Can you stay still, please?

01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:42.595
Sorry.

01:00:42.639 --> 01:00:45.206
Make sure we have enough pills
for both of them.

01:00:47.556 --> 01:00:50.342
- What?
- When they finish the deal,

01:00:50.385 --> 01:00:52.997
we are going
to take care of them.

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:56.217
But... you said
it's too dangerous.

01:00:56.261 --> 01:00:58.002
It's risky,

01:00:58.045 --> 01:00:59.177
yeah.

01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:02.180
But it will be worth it.

01:01:02.223 --> 01:01:04.573
But like you said,
there's two of them,

01:01:04.617 --> 01:01:07.838
so if one of them
were to get knocked out first,

01:01:07.881 --> 01:01:10.623
then the other might realize
what's happening, and then...

01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:11.755
and then he'll shoot us.

01:01:11.798 --> 01:01:13.974
We just have to be on top of it.

01:01:14.018 --> 01:01:16.107
Separate them when we drug them.

01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:19.066
I don't know, Mom.
We've never done it with two.

01:01:19.110 --> 01:01:22.243
They will have a lot of money,
Ester.

01:01:22.287 --> 01:01:25.420
- But they have guns!
- It's not a battle.

01:01:25.464 --> 01:01:27.771
They will not even know
it's coming.

01:01:27.814 --> 01:01:30.512
I don't know
what changed with you.

01:01:30.556 --> 01:01:33.080
It's too risky, and... and...

01:01:33.124 --> 01:01:34.952
it's worse, actually,

01:01:34.995 --> 01:01:38.085
because now Ignacio
is feeling better

01:01:38.129 --> 01:01:40.174
and we don't even
have the upper hand anymore.

01:01:40.218 --> 01:01:42.176
Maybe...

01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:44.831
but they are getting
comfortable with us.

01:01:46.354 --> 01:01:48.269
Their guard is down.

01:01:49.749 --> 01:01:52.883
Just don't lose focus, Ester.

01:01:52.926 --> 01:01:55.624
You're the one
who wants to get out of here.

01:01:57.322 --> 01:01:58.845
I'm doing this for you.

01:02:01.195 --> 01:02:04.111
I want your dreams
to come true.

01:02:08.942 --> 01:02:10.465
Just keep your mouth shut.

01:02:10.509 --> 01:02:13.904
No matter what these people
say or do, just...

01:02:13.947 --> 01:02:15.470
stay quiet.

01:02:15.514 --> 01:02:16.602
Stay by the car.

01:02:31.486 --> 01:02:32.661
Show me.

01:02:34.707 --> 01:02:36.013
You first.

01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:40.757
Vamonos. Fuck these...

01:02:43.672 --> 01:02:45.326
Where ya goin'?

01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:47.154
Oh... Oh, you want to kill me?

01:02:47.198 --> 01:02:49.156
OK, go ahead.
You want to explain to your boss

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:52.507
how your eastern pipeline
disappeared?

01:02:52.551 --> 01:02:55.510
Austin...
go grab the bags.

01:03:09.524 --> 01:03:11.439
Test out the guns.
If you like them,

01:03:11.483 --> 01:03:13.354
we can arrange
a full shipment tomorrow.

01:04:17.418 --> 01:04:18.550
Ohh.

01:04:18.593 --> 01:04:20.160
- You scared me.
- Sorry.

01:04:21.988 --> 01:04:23.163
We need to talk.

01:04:23.207 --> 01:04:24.599
What is it, Ester?

01:04:27.341 --> 01:04:28.341
What?

01:04:28.342 --> 01:04:30.344
You need to get out of here,

01:04:30.388 --> 01:04:31.519
as soon as possible.

01:04:33.086 --> 01:04:35.001
- Why?
- I don't know, I just... I...

01:04:35.045 --> 01:04:36.176
I have a bad feeling.

01:04:37.395 --> 01:04:39.353
Everything went fine today.

01:04:39.397 --> 01:04:41.181
We're going back tomorrow,
and then...

01:04:41.225 --> 01:04:42.704
we'll be gone.

01:04:42.748 --> 01:04:45.055
Wait, we're...
We're leaving tomorrow?

01:04:51.496 --> 01:04:53.846
Well, we can give you...

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:56.588
a ride to Siesta Shores,

01:04:56.631 --> 01:04:58.372
but beyond that,
it'd be too dangerous.

01:05:00.853 --> 01:05:02.507
No.

01:05:02.550 --> 01:05:04.639
No, you said...
You said I could come with you.

01:05:08.992 --> 01:05:12.604
I said you could
get a ride with us, Ester.

01:05:12.647 --> 01:05:16.216
Look, I think you have a shot
at a different life...

01:05:17.696 --> 01:05:18.696
a better life.

01:05:20.699 --> 01:05:22.657
And I...

01:05:22.701 --> 01:05:25.660
I want to help you,
but this is all that I can do.

01:05:30.013 --> 01:05:32.015
Ester, don't... don't do that.

01:05:34.278 --> 01:05:35.540
Let's run away together...

01:05:37.107 --> 01:05:38.325
just you and me.

01:05:40.849 --> 01:05:42.373
It's not that easy, Ester.

01:05:43.765 --> 01:05:45.506
Maybe if my life
was different, but...

01:05:47.639 --> 01:05:49.554
but with me,
it'll just be more of the same.

01:07:02.714 --> 01:07:04.933
What are you doing?

01:07:04.977 --> 01:07:08.154
Hey... What...
What you got there?

01:07:10.591 --> 01:07:12.637
What you got in that caja?

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:13.680
Hey, we... we...

01:07:15.509 --> 01:07:16.554
we amigos.

01:07:17.772 --> 01:07:20.036
Me and you, we...
we amigos.

01:07:20.079 --> 01:07:21.385
What's in the caja?

01:07:25.650 --> 01:07:27.173
You got goodies, eh?

01:07:28.783 --> 01:07:30.307
You got goodies.

01:07:38.141 --> 01:07:40.447
Where...
where did you get this?

01:07:41.535 --> 01:07:42.535
Huh?

01:07:42.536 --> 01:07:43.842
No! No.

01:07:43.885 --> 01:07:45.539
Where did you get this?

01:07:45.583 --> 01:07:46.801
Huh?

01:07:46.845 --> 01:07:48.586
No! Whe-Where did you
get this?

01:07:50.370 --> 01:07:52.546
Where did you get it?

01:08:03.775 --> 01:08:05.646
- Mami?
- What?

01:08:07.170 --> 01:08:08.432
"Mami" what?

01:08:12.566 --> 01:08:15.656
Do you think
I don't know about this?

01:08:18.006 --> 01:08:20.313
Hm?

01:08:20.357 --> 01:08:24.317
You think I don't know
what happened in my own home?

01:08:29.279 --> 01:08:33.152
And now you try to
sneak around with that boy.

01:08:39.767 --> 01:08:42.029
Don't try to outsmart me.

01:08:43.728 --> 01:08:46.209
You will lose every time.

01:08:51.953 --> 01:08:55.131
All I want is...
your happiness...

01:08:57.959 --> 01:09:00.571
and this is how you repay me.

01:09:04.836 --> 01:09:05.880
Huh?

01:09:07.404 --> 01:09:08.404
OK.

01:09:10.015 --> 01:09:11.015
OK.

01:09:14.019 --> 01:09:15.846
You will stay here tonight.

01:09:17.979 --> 01:09:20.591
I will take care
of them on my own.

01:09:20.634 --> 01:09:22.287
Mami, please don't...

01:09:49.968 --> 01:09:51.099
Mami!

01:11:17.534 --> 01:11:18.926
Ester?

01:11:18.970 --> 01:11:21.364
Paco, help me.
She locked me in.

01:11:41.558 --> 01:11:43.516
What happened?
Are you OK?

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:45.170
We need to leave right now.

01:11:45.213 --> 01:11:46.693
Why? Why did she
lock you in there?

01:11:46.737 --> 01:11:48.478
Because she knows
about us.

01:11:48.521 --> 01:11:50.349
You have to listen to me.
We need to go, OK?

01:11:50.393 --> 01:11:52.066
- Where's Ignacio?
- I think he's upstairs.

01:11:52.090 --> 01:11:53.763
- He's talking to your mom.
- There's no time.

01:11:53.787 --> 01:11:56.616
Listen, listen, listen.
Ester, I already told you.

01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:58.531
We're not running away
together. We can't.

01:11:58.575 --> 01:12:00.490
I know, but we have to go.

01:12:47.928 --> 01:12:51.671
Paco, you're gonna die
if you don't leave right now.

01:12:51.715 --> 01:12:55.675
Look, I'm not leaving,
and I'm certainly not dying here.

01:12:57.851 --> 01:12:59.026
My mama's gonna kill you.

01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:03.161
Paco, you don't understand.

01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:07.948
My mom... she...

01:13:09.297 --> 01:13:10.864
she's done this before.

01:13:10.908 --> 01:13:13.258
That's what she does. She...

01:13:13.301 --> 01:13:15.521
she drugs people
and she drowns them.

01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:21.788
You don't sound very tough
saying that, Ester.

01:13:21.832 --> 01:13:22.920
I'm telling the truth.

01:13:24.878 --> 01:13:26.010
Remember the guest?

01:13:27.272 --> 01:13:30.623
He wasn't drunk.
He was drugged.

01:13:30.667 --> 01:13:32.495
We were gonna kill him.

01:13:34.627 --> 01:13:35.627
"We"?

01:13:38.326 --> 01:13:40.111
You...

01:13:40.154 --> 01:13:42.635
You mean you...
you do this with her?

01:13:42.679 --> 01:13:43.679
Yes.

01:13:44.681 --> 01:13:46.465
But...

01:13:46.509 --> 01:13:48.424
I would never do that to you.

01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:52.470
You kill people?

01:13:53.646 --> 01:13:55.474
Yes, because...

01:13:55.518 --> 01:13:56.910
because we need the money...

01:13:57.998 --> 01:13:59.173
to get out of here.

01:14:03.874 --> 01:14:05.528
You understand.

01:14:06.703 --> 01:14:08.531
I'm just like you.

01:14:11.925 --> 01:14:12.925
No, Ester.

01:14:14.667 --> 01:14:16.408
Y-You and I
are nothing alike.

01:14:17.757 --> 01:14:19.280
Yes, we are.

01:14:19.324 --> 01:14:20.847
You're... you're sick.

01:14:22.022 --> 01:14:23.981
No, but we don't...

01:14:24.024 --> 01:14:26.549
We don't... We... we only
kill bad people...

01:14:26.592 --> 01:14:29.203
people who deserve it.

01:14:29.247 --> 01:14:31.641
And... and we don't
make them suffer.

01:14:31.684 --> 01:14:34.905
That... that...
that's exactly it.

01:14:34.948 --> 01:14:37.385
S-somehow in your...

01:14:37.429 --> 01:14:39.562
in y-your...
your fucked-up mind,

01:14:39.605 --> 01:14:43.435
with your...
your bullshit excuses

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:45.437
that your
goddamn mother gave you,

01:14:45.481 --> 01:14:47.526
you... you... you think
it's OK to kill.

01:14:48.745 --> 01:14:51.008
I... I don't.

01:14:51.051 --> 01:14:55.534
I don't...
I don't make excuses. I...

01:14:55.578 --> 01:14:57.144
I know what I am.

01:14:57.188 --> 01:14:58.755
But we do it because...

01:14:58.798 --> 01:15:01.975
because...
because we have to survive.

01:15:02.019 --> 01:15:03.847
Basta, Ester. Stop.

01:15:03.890 --> 01:15:07.111
Stop lying to yourself.

01:15:07.154 --> 01:15:10.375
Y-you don't have
to kill, OK? You...

01:15:10.418 --> 01:15:12.333
You choose to kill. I...

01:15:13.987 --> 01:15:14.987
I know that.

01:15:18.775 --> 01:15:20.690
I cho... I chose this.

01:15:23.170 --> 01:15:25.695
Maybe I felt like
I had no choices,

01:15:25.738 --> 01:15:28.567
but you... you always
have a choice.

01:15:31.222 --> 01:15:33.877
I just... I don't like
the options, Ester.

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:35.574
Paco... Paco...

01:15:35.618 --> 01:15:37.489
- Paco, please don't go inside.
- Ester...

01:15:37.533 --> 01:15:38.795
Paco, please!

01:15:46.193 --> 01:15:47.325
Paco!

01:15:50.633 --> 01:15:52.243
No, no, no, no.

01:15:52.286 --> 01:15:54.332
No, no, don't do this.
Don't do this.

01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:57.161
He was a bad boy.

01:15:57.204 --> 01:15:59.467
He was one of them,
mijita linda.

01:15:59.511 --> 01:16:01.339
No. No, no, no.

01:16:09.521 --> 01:16:11.349
Look at this mess. Eh?

01:16:11.392 --> 01:16:14.308
And I hope you can understand

01:16:14.352 --> 01:16:16.397
what your stupidity causes.

01:16:16.441 --> 01:16:17.441
Imbecile!

01:16:24.841 --> 01:16:26.538
Ya mi amor, ya mi amor.

01:16:26.582 --> 01:16:28.627
Shh shh.

01:19:16.839 --> 01:19:17.840
Buenos dÃ­as.

01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:31.114
These aren't very warm.

01:19:33.029 --> 01:19:34.378
I'm sorry.

01:19:43.169 --> 01:19:44.736
The eggs are really good.

01:19:45.824 --> 01:19:46.912
I'm glad you like them.

01:19:58.489 --> 01:20:00.012
- Mom?
- Hmm?

01:20:02.710 --> 01:20:04.277
Are you happy?

01:20:04.321 --> 01:20:09.021
As happy as one can be
with a life like this.

01:20:10.501 --> 01:20:11.632
Then let's leave.

01:20:13.025 --> 01:20:14.025
Right now.

01:20:14.026 --> 01:20:15.332
We cannot.

01:20:16.986 --> 01:20:17.986
Why not?

01:20:20.250 --> 01:20:21.642
You know why.

01:20:21.686 --> 01:20:23.122
The money, Ester.

01:20:24.515 --> 01:20:25.908
I can get a job.

01:20:31.739 --> 01:20:34.307
Getting a job isn't that easy.

01:20:34.351 --> 01:20:36.309
You... You don't have skills.

01:20:36.353 --> 01:20:37.833
I can cook...

01:20:38.921 --> 01:20:40.705
I can clean.

01:20:40.748 --> 01:20:43.012
I don't need anything fancy.

01:20:45.536 --> 01:20:47.886
I'll go first,
and I'll get a job,

01:20:47.930 --> 01:20:50.454
and once I'm settled,
you can join me.

01:20:50.497 --> 01:20:53.109
You will not do that to me...

01:20:53.152 --> 01:20:54.152
right?

01:20:55.938 --> 01:20:57.156
Abandon me,

01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:00.507
after everything
I've done for you?

01:21:00.551 --> 01:21:03.119
I'm saying
you can come with me.

01:21:03.162 --> 01:21:04.903
And I say no!

01:21:04.947 --> 01:21:05.947
Why?

01:21:07.688 --> 01:21:09.081
It's been forever, Mom.

01:21:10.517 --> 01:21:12.824
What more do you need
for us to leave?

01:21:12.868 --> 01:21:15.348
What we do,
it's a good thing.

01:21:15.392 --> 01:21:19.526
We are actually making a difference
in the world!

01:21:19.570 --> 01:21:21.441
What?!

01:21:21.485 --> 01:21:24.357
We are getting rid
of bad people.

01:21:25.968 --> 01:21:29.710
We are liberating
their tormented souls!

01:21:31.364 --> 01:21:33.323
And by doing that,

01:21:33.366 --> 01:21:36.108
we are saving innocent lives.

01:22:24.026 --> 01:22:26.811
I want the best for you...

01:22:26.854 --> 01:22:27.854
right?

01:22:31.207 --> 01:22:32.208
Yes.

01:22:34.253 --> 01:22:35.341
Me too, Mami.

01:23:21.692 --> 01:23:22.692
Please.

01:23:25.087 --> 01:23:26.827
We will leave one day.

01:23:28.090 --> 01:23:29.178
Hm?

01:23:31.484 --> 01:23:32.484
I love you.

01:23:34.270 --> 01:23:35.488
Do you love me?

01:23:39.623 --> 01:23:41.190
I love you, Mami.
