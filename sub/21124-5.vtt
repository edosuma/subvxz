Morning.

00:25.650 --> 00:28.570
Just, uh, getting back from the gym here.
It's an early workout.

00:28.653 --> 00:30.780
Right. 'Cause that's a workout bustier.

00:31.114 --> 00:33.116
It's a new costume element I'm working on.

00:33.199 --> 00:36.911
Sometimes you need to break 'em in.
'Cause they're very, very-- they're tight.

-Rosen?
-This is your last warning.

00:44.586 --> 00:46.546
You break curfew again, you're fired.

00:46.629 --> 00:50.884
Look, are we still doing this whole

00:50.967 --> 00:51.801
Come on.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.471
'Cause I really don't see you up
anybody else's asshole.

00:54.554 --> 00:57.891
Other people don't piss me off as much.
And Sam put me in charge.

00:57.974 --> 01:01.269
I'm official now. So, deal with it, Rosen.

-Yeah, I like it.

And finally, our star.

02:00.703 --> 02:03.039

I'd like you to meet Glen Klitnick,

our phenomenal executive at K-DTV,

02:06.126 --> 02:09.295
aka, the man who's making all

02:09.379 --> 02:13.091
Glen, I'd like you to meet
the beautiful Deborah Eagan.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.344

My wife, Jodie,
she goes crazy for <i>All My Children.</i>

-They film in New York.

02:32.318 --> 02:34.237
So, I've always been based in LA.

02:34.529 --> 02:35.363
So, no.

02:35.446 --> 02:38.074
[chuckles] Deb, why don't you show him
what you've been working on?

02:39.242 --> 02:41.119
Okay. Uh, yeah.

02:41.202 --> 02:43.288
So, I've just been practicing
some landings.

02:43.872 --> 02:47.375
Um, so, if I did like a jump
off the ropes type thing,

02:47.458 --> 02:51.129
I could sort of land
in like a somersault-y, um...

02:51.212 --> 02:52.130
type thing.

02:52.213 --> 02:53.798
I could just mark it for you.

02:56.718 --> 02:59.095
And reset. Anyway. And then, um...

02:59.679 --> 03:02.265
And then my, uh, character is...

03:02.390 --> 03:03.766
is Liberty Belle.

03:04.350 --> 03:05.643
She's the all-American hero.

03:05.727 --> 03:09.397
Uh, she's kind of like the role model
for kids.

03:09.564 --> 03:12.442
Um, so, I could then say something like...
Like...

03:13.109 --> 03:14.777
"Be all that you can be."

03:14.861 --> 03:17.947
Or like, "Say nope to dope."

03:18.031 --> 03:19.198
That kind of thing.

03:19.866 --> 03:22.827
I am a mom.

03:23.745 --> 03:27.916
So, I know how important it is
to be patriotic.

03:28.583 --> 03:31.169
Uh, but I'm still kind of working on it,
so...

03:32.587 --> 03:35.924
Uh, well, I look forward to seeing it
when it's done.

-This way, Glen.
-Okay.

03:45.183 --> 03:47.727
[Sam] So, it's deeper than that, really.
Okay?

03:47.810 --> 03:51.856
They're gonna be wrestling with their
own female stereotypes, metaphorically.

03:51.940 --> 03:52.774
Do you understand?

03:52.857 --> 03:56.236
I think that's something that'll
really resonate with female audiences.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.571
And guys-- Well, guys, let's be honest.

03:58.655 --> 04:01.658
They're gonna watch
because girls wrestling is fucking hot.

04:01.741 --> 04:06.120
[chuckles] Sure. Though Glen's
Saturday morning programming targets kids.

-[Sam] Glen.

04:21.552 --> 04:24.013
Strong concept, strong timeslot.

04:24.597 --> 04:26.891
I feel like we could be
making something special.

04:26.975 --> 04:29.477
Providing we find the right sponsor.

04:29.560 --> 04:32.021
-Sure.
-Wait, aren't you the sponsor?

04:32.105 --> 04:34.107
Uh, Sam, I'm the producer. Heh.

04:34.190 --> 04:35.608
Sponsor pays for airtime.

04:35.942 --> 04:38.695

-Well, we have a great lead.

Now is not the time.

05:42.050 --> 05:45.678
Well, I just always thought
he was very controlling.

Please don't put me in the position
of having to defend the man I just left.

25:38.995 --> 25:40.705
Mr. Monopoly, the heel.

25:41.665 --> 25:42.999
This is gonna be a grudge match.

25:43.583 --> 25:45.919
-Like, in real life?
-In the story.

25:46.461 --> 25:48.505
Every match is like another chapter.

25:48.588 --> 25:52.717
It started when Mr. Monopoly closed down
the factory in Steel Horse's town,

25:52.801 --> 25:54.886
and he and all of his friends
lost their jobs.

25:55.303 --> 25:59.266
And then, he kidnapped Crystal,
Steel Horse's woman, and brainwashed her.

26:00.141 --> 26:02.978
She was his high school sweetheart,
but now she thinks he's evil.

26:03.561 --> 26:06.439
He still loves her.
Every time, tries to win her back.

26:07.274 --> 26:08.316
Come on!

26:09.109 --> 26:09.943
Come on!

26:10.026 --> 26:12.696
Come on! Come on!

26:12.779 --> 26:14.698
[audience booing]

26:14.781 --> 26:15.949
I'm here for you.

26:16.533 --> 26:17.409
Come on.

26:17.659 --> 26:18.827
I'm right here.

26:19.035 --> 26:21.788
-No, no, no. You stay right there!
-Come on! Come on!

26:24.374 --> 26:25.834
[audience shrieks]

26:26.334 --> 26:29.296
It turned out
they're actually half-brothers, and--

26:29.379 --> 26:31.673
And that was his plan,
to ruin Steel Horse's life

26:31.756 --> 26:33.925
to get revenge
on the father who abandoned him.

26:36.636 --> 26:37.554
Oh, my God.

26:37.637 --> 26:38.638
[referee] Let's go!

26:38.722 --> 26:40.015
[audience gasps]

26:40.098 --> 26:41.224
It's a soap opera!

26:43.727 --> 26:44.894
This is a soap opera!

26:47.105 --> 26:48.732
I understand how to do that.

26:53.069 --> 26:54.154
Come on!

26:58.074 --> 26:59.534
[screams]

27:03.621 --> 27:04.622
[yells]

27:04.706 --> 27:06.666
[cheering]

27:08.084 --> 27:08.918
Come on!

27:12.922 --> 27:16.551
[audience chanting] Steel Horse!
Steel Horse! Steel Horse!

27:16.634 --> 27:21.139
-[cheers]
-[crowd continues chanting]

27:23.516 --> 27:25.185
My brother said he's super nice.

27:34.194 --> 27:35.320
Hi, Dale.

27:35.403 --> 27:37.447
I'm Carmen, Tom and Kurt's little sister.

27:37.530 --> 27:38.615
Oh, right. Sure.

27:38.698 --> 27:42.077
We just wanted to come back
and tell you how amazing that was.

27:42.369 --> 27:45.330
-Um, these are my friends. Melanie--
-Melrose.

27:45.413 --> 27:46.831
Melrose. Hi, it's a pleasure.

27:47.582 --> 27:48.458
-Hi.
-Hi.

27:48.541 --> 27:50.335
-And Debbie.
-Hi.

27:54.714 --> 27:55.882
You're Laura Morgan.

27:56.549 --> 27:59.344
-From <i>Paradise Cove.</i>
-Oh, yeah. Oh, God.

27:59.427 --> 28:00.804
Yeah. I mean, I was.

28:00.887 --> 28:01.805
[chuckles]

28:01.888 --> 28:04.391
I can't believe I'm meeting you,
I'm a huge fan.

28:04.974 --> 28:06.184
-You watch soaps?
-Yeah.

28:06.768 --> 28:08.561
It's where we get all our best ideas from.

28:08.812 --> 28:12.524
But I have to say,
new Laura can't act for shit.

28:13.149 --> 28:15.443
[laughing]

28:17.862 --> 28:22.283
I sell it, but he's the one
with the real strength, the real craft.

28:22.867 --> 28:25.286
That's how it is with bad guys.
They're craftsmen.

28:25.954 --> 28:27.539
You mean the heel.

28:28.206 --> 28:29.457
[Steel Horse] Superfan here.

28:29.958 --> 28:30.792
[Debbie chuckles]

28:30.875 --> 28:32.877
Yeah. The heel makes the face.

28:33.420 --> 28:35.422
Rick has been making me look good
for years.

28:36.256 --> 28:37.257
That's a good friend.

28:37.340 --> 28:40.301
We're not friends.
You don't have to be friends to wrestle.

28:41.261 --> 28:43.638
It's like an unspoken language.

28:44.180 --> 28:47.142
I look at him like this...
he looks at me like that.

28:47.726 --> 28:51.479
And we know what's gonna go down.
Because that's a partnership, you know?

28:51.980 --> 28:54.399
We don't like each other,
but we make each other better.

28:55.483 --> 28:57.944
Shit in the ring, it's just entertainment.

28:59.112 --> 29:01.114
But there's gotta be
something there that's real.

29:01.865 --> 29:03.283
That's what makes it work.

29:04.451 --> 29:05.952
That's what makes it hit you.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.247
Right here.

29:15.879 --> 29:17.172
[Melrose] Debbie?

29:18.882 --> 29:21.301
-It's getting late.
-[Steel Horse] It's cool.

29:21.885 --> 29:24.512
You probably gotta go home
to your boyfriend or husband.

29:24.596 --> 29:28.308
Uh, you know what,
I am actually recently separated, so...

29:28.391 --> 29:29.225
Oh.

29:29.726 --> 29:30.935
Mm-hmm.

29:33.772 --> 29:36.816
Debbie, don't make me be the rules person.

29:36.900 --> 29:38.610
I'm not emotionally equipped for it.

29:38.693 --> 29:40.612
You know what, why don't you just--

29:40.695 --> 29:43.281
Just, uh-- Just take my car.

29:43.364 --> 29:45.158
-Are you sure?
-I'll take a cab. Yeah.

29:45.241 --> 29:47.952
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Fantastic! Bye.

29:48.036 --> 29:50.413
-If Cherry finds out--
-You know, I'll deal with Cherry.

29:50.497 --> 29:51.748
-[Melrose] Really sweet of you.
-Bye.

29:51.831 --> 29:54.042
-Thanks for having us.
-Yeah, yeah. Bye.

29:57.212 --> 29:59.214
-Separated?
-Yeah.

29:59.297 --> 30:02.258
-I feel bad for your husband.
-Really? 'Cause I don't give a shit.

30:10.225 --> 30:11.267
[Keith sighs]

30:11.351 --> 30:14.562
Jesus, baby, it's five in the morning.

30:14.646 --> 30:15.522
And when I get back,

30:15.605 --> 30:18.566
there might actually be hot water left
for my damn shower.

30:18.650 --> 30:19.692
[Keith chuckles]

30:22.445 --> 30:24.113
Mm. Mm. Go run, go.

30:24.906 --> 30:26.282
[Cherry chuckles]

30:30.578 --> 30:31.412
[Debbie] Fuck.

30:32.038 --> 30:34.165
Shit. Where the fuck is that key?

30:37.836 --> 30:39.504
Hey, Cherry.

30:39.587 --> 30:41.130
Oh, good morning.

30:41.589 --> 30:42.423
Hi.

30:42.507 --> 30:46.636
I'm so sorry, I, uh...
Well, had a little bit of an emergency.

30:46.719 --> 30:51.015
And-- Well, everything's fine, but--
I'm just gonna grab my keys, and...

30:51.099 --> 30:52.517
Oh... no smoking.

30:55.603 --> 30:56.855
Keith thinks I quit.

30:57.730 --> 31:01.609
Well, it's my first pack
since Randy was born, so...

31:02.652 --> 31:05.989
[clicks tongue] So...
did Steel Horse live up to the name?

31:06.739 --> 31:07.949
[chuckles sarcastically]

31:08.032 --> 31:10.201
-They told you.
-Melrose did.

31:10.952 --> 31:13.872
I told her what we do to rats where
I come from. Bitch shut up after that.

31:13.955 --> 31:15.373
[both chuckle]

31:15.456 --> 31:16.457
Yeah...

31:18.543 --> 31:20.086
You didn't answer my question.

31:21.004 --> 31:22.589
Oh. Um...

31:23.798 --> 31:25.383
Yeah, it was good, I guess.

31:25.466 --> 31:26.718
You know, it's exciting.

31:26.801 --> 31:27.677
It's kind of...

31:28.761 --> 31:29.596
So...

31:31.389 --> 31:32.974
And fucking weird. I don't know.

31:33.057 --> 31:34.309
[both laugh]

31:35.852 --> 31:37.937
You know,
you're with someone for a long time,

31:38.021 --> 31:41.065
and all you think about
is all the guys you'd get to sleep with

31:41.149 --> 31:43.109
if he just, like, disappeared...

31:44.193 --> 31:45.320
and then he does.

31:45.403 --> 31:48.281
And you do, and...

31:49.073 --> 31:51.534
You just remember how much easier it is--

31:51.618 --> 31:54.203
How much better everything works
when, um... [clicks tongue]

31:54.579 --> 31:57.832
it's someone you really know,
and, uh, who really knows you.

31:59.167 --> 32:01.336
-Sounds like horse was less than steely.
-Oh, no.

32:01.419 --> 32:03.463
The horse was steely. Exhaustingly steely.

32:03.546 --> 32:06.507
Steely enough
that I'm dreading having to pee.

32:07.425 --> 32:09.177
So, I gotta get some sleep.

32:12.180 --> 32:13.139
Enjoy.

32:13.222 --> 32:15.642
Oh, no. You're not getting off that easy.

32:16.309 --> 32:17.435
We've got a 5K uphill.

32:17.518 --> 32:18.519
-5K?
-Just you and me.

32:19.103 --> 32:20.188
Oh...

32:20.271 --> 32:21.189
Okay.

32:21.981 --> 32:25.610
Give me five minutes to wash my face
and drain my tits.

32:25.693 --> 32:26.903
You got until I'm done.

32:26.986 --> 32:28.071
-Okay.
-Yep.

32:28.154 --> 32:29.280
[Debbie groans]

32:29.697 --> 32:30.990
[ringing]

32:34.369 --> 32:37.497
Dawn, enough with the fucking crank calls.

32:37.580 --> 32:38.831
It's Debbie.

32:39.540 --> 32:40.375
Oh.

32:40.959 --> 32:43.461
Oh, hey.
You all right? What's going on?

32:44.003 --> 32:46.464
Yeah.
So, I've been thinking about the show.

32:46.547 --> 32:47.548
<i>What? You know, look,</i>

32:47.632 --> 32:50.969
I know that the situation
with the network executive was not...

32:51.761 --> 32:52.637
ideal--

32:52.720 --> 32:53.596
I'm all in.

32:54.263 --> 32:57.100
But if you want me to be the star,
I need a great heel.

32:57.183 --> 32:58.017
Find me one.
