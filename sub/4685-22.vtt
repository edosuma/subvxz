He seems a little unstable.

16:48.341 --> 16:49.718
Yeah, he could use

16:49.719 --> 16:51.094
a check-up from

16:48.341 --> 16:51.094
the neck up.

16:53.096 --> 16:54.494
We do not wish to be here!

16:54.495 --> 16:55.891
Our plane crashed!

16:56.099 --> 16:57.559
Excuse me, no, no.

16:57.684 --> 16:59.603
It was brilliantly

16:59.604 --> 17:01.521
landed by a heroic

16:57.684 --> 17:01.521
and underpaid nanny.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.441
That would be me.

17:04.566 --> 17:05.839
Well, why didn't you

17:05.839 --> 17:07.109
just say so?

17:07.151 --> 17:08.529
We were a little

17:08.530 --> 17:09.905
busy running from

17:07.151 --> 17:09.905
your fake monster!

17:10.113 --> 17:11.781
Oh, yeah, my bad.

17:12.950 --> 17:16.703
Bertram!

17:16.828 --> 17:19.915
Bertram!

17:20.123 --> 17:21.916
I cannot believe

17:21.917 --> 17:23.710
Mr. Kipling shed me

17:20.123 --> 17:23.710
like last year's skin

17:23.835 --> 17:25.170
so he can become

17:25.171 --> 17:26.503
some lady lizard's

17:23.835 --> 17:26.503
sugar dragon.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.966
Ravi, that's so sad.

17:29.132 --> 17:30.592
I know.

17:30.717 --> 17:31.947
So I told him

17:31.948 --> 17:33.177
I hoped he and his

17:30.717 --> 17:33.177
scaly little swamp siren

17:33.303 --> 17:34.888
- would be
- very happy together!

17:37.015 --> 17:37.849
I cannot go on.

17:37.975 --> 17:39.310
Mr. Kipling would

17:39.311 --> 17:40.644
want you to.

17:40.769 --> 17:41.895
I think he would also

17:41.896 --> 17:43.021
want you to carry me.

17:49.987 --> 17:51.072
So you know

17:51.073 --> 17:52.155
about Island of

17:49.987 --> 17:52.155
the Monsters?

17:52.280 --> 17:54.220
That legend inspired

17:54.221 --> 17:56.159
my fake monster.

17:56.284 --> 17:57.762
- If you'd hung around
- a little longer,

17:57.786 --> 17:59.329
I would have

17:59.330 --> 18:00.872
brought out Katanga,

17:57.786 --> 18:00.872
the Crab Woman.

18:02.165 --> 18:04.375
(HISSING)

18:04.501 --> 18:06.711
You're all kinds of weird.

18:08.964 --> 18:10.298
(SCREAMS)

18:10.423 --> 18:11.424
Idiot!

18:12.592 --> 18:14.260
BERTRAM: Ow!

18:14.385 --> 18:15.512
That sounded like Bertram!

18:15.637 --> 18:16.638
Yeah, I'd recognize

18:16.639 --> 18:17.639
that whine anywhere.

18:19.933 --> 18:22.226
KIDS: Bertram!

18:24.228 --> 18:26.189
- We thought we'd
- never find you!

18:26.230 --> 18:27.420
So did I.

18:27.421 --> 18:28.608
A guy can dream.

18:28.733 --> 18:30.735
(SCREAMING)

18:31.862 --> 18:33.738
Those bones!

18:33.864 --> 18:35.199
Those feathers!

18:35.200 --> 18:36.533
I'd know them

18:33.864 --> 18:36.533
anywhere!

18:36.658 --> 18:38.055
You're eating the last of

18:38.056 --> 18:39.452
the blue-breasted goobies!

18:39.577 --> 18:41.038
Huh. No kidding.

18:41.204 --> 18:43.206
(SCREAMS)

18:43.331 --> 18:44.645
I've spent years

18:44.646 --> 18:45.959
studying it!

18:46.084 --> 18:47.485
- All my research,
- down the drain!

18:48.920 --> 18:51.381
And into his colon.

18:51.506 --> 18:54.147
- You might want to - write in your report
- That it was delicious.

18:54.968 --> 18:55.969
(SCREAMING)

18:57.804 --> 18:59.973
(BURPING)

19:00.098 --> 19:01.224
(SCREAMING)

19:03.977 --> 19:05.520
Hey, we're almost there.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.397
Finally, you're back!

19:07.522 --> 19:09.249
- While you guys - were out vacationing,
- I was...

19:09.273 --> 19:10.358
Not now.

19:10.359 --> 19:11.442
A helicopter's coming!

19:11.568 --> 19:12.653
We're saved!

19:12.654 --> 19:13.737
We're saved! Yay!

19:13.862 --> 19:15.613
- That's what
- I was trying to tell you!

19:15.739 --> 19:17.595
I plugged the doohickey

19:17.596 --> 19:19.450
into the thingy

19:15.739 --> 19:19.450
and the gizmo went, "Ding!"

19:19.576 --> 19:21.119
Oh, dear,

19:21.120 --> 19:22.662
have you been

19:19.576 --> 19:22.662
bitten, too?

19:22.787 --> 19:24.548
- I hope there's a spork
- on the helicopter.

19:25.248 --> 19:26.624
All right, everybody on!

19:26.750 --> 19:27.918
Okay.

19:28.043 --> 19:30.712
No! I don't want to go.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.318
I want to stay here

19:32.319 --> 19:33.798
with no responsibility,

19:33.924 --> 19:36.093
no children,

19:36.094 --> 19:38.261
and these incredibly

19:33.924 --> 19:38.261
comfy clothes.

19:38.386 --> 19:39.533
Bertram, there's no two-ply

19:39.534 --> 19:40.680
toilet paper here.

19:40.805 --> 19:41.805
There's not even one-ply.

19:42.099 --> 19:44.517
Out of my way!

19:49.272 --> 19:52.943
BERTRAM: I call shotgun! Whoo!

19:53.068 --> 19:54.402
- Could someone
- get that for me?

19:56.279 --> 19:57.739
- Oh, man.
- (ALL EXCLAIMING)

19:58.782 --> 19:59.782
I'm blind.

20:01.492 --> 20:02.953
Guys, come on.

20:03.078 --> 20:04.101
Go, go, go.

20:04.102 --> 20:05.122
Can you help them?

20:03.078 --> 20:05.122
Thank you. Thank you.

20:07.582 --> 20:09.272
Jessie, I cannot

20:09.273 --> 20:10.961
leave Mr. Kipling.

20:12.587 --> 20:14.506
I know how hard it is,

20:14.507 --> 20:16.424
Ravi, okay?

20:16.549 --> 20:18.406
Maybe Mr. Kipling

20:18.407 --> 20:20.261
just wanted to be

20:16.549 --> 20:20.261
with his own kind.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.139
- I'm so sorry,
- but we have to go.

20:42.450 --> 20:44.410
- Mr. Kipling!
- You came back!

20:50.291 --> 20:52.482
I guess

20:52.483 --> 20:54.671
Mr. Kipling couldn't live

20:50.291 --> 20:54.671
without you, either.

20:54.796 --> 20:57.216
Nothing is stronger

20:57.217 --> 20:59.634
than the bond between

20:54.796 --> 20:59.634
a boy and his lizard.

20:59.759 --> 21:00.886
I wonder what happened

21:00.887 --> 21:02.012
with him and his

20:59.759 --> 21:02.012
scaly little swamp siren.

21:02.137 --> 21:03.930
He must have kissed it

21:03.931 --> 21:05.723
and subsequently dissed it!

21:08.185 --> 21:09.426
- All right.
- I'll get him. Go!

21:11.437 --> 21:13.919
So, you already

21:13.920 --> 21:16.400
got tired of the old

21:11.437 --> 21:16.400
ball and chain, huh?

21:16.526 --> 21:17.673
Yeah.

21:17.674 --> 21:18.820
Just like every man

21:16.526 --> 21:18.820
I ever dated.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.113
Cold-blooded.

21:20.238 --> 21:22.365
Come on.

21:25.994 --> 21:27.721
- The kids are - in the cockpit
- Asking the pilot,

21:27.745 --> 21:28.746
"Are we there yet?

21:28.747 --> 21:29.747
Are we there yet?

21:27.745 --> 21:29.747
Are we there yet?"

21:30.790 --> 21:32.042
Better him than me.

21:33.001 --> 21:34.127
I need to rewrite my will.

21:34.252 --> 21:35.879
- I threw up
- in the last one.

21:37.881 --> 21:38.966
Thanks for

21:38.967 --> 21:40.050
bringing me along.

21:40.175 --> 21:41.615
It's the least we could do,

21:41.616 --> 21:43.053
considering what happened.

21:43.178 --> 21:44.221
You mean ruining

21:44.222 --> 21:45.263
my life's work

21:45.388 --> 21:46.827
by letting your butler

21:46.828 --> 21:48.266
eat my blue-breasted goobie

21:45.388 --> 21:48.266
into extinction?

21:50.434 --> 21:51.561
Yeah, that.

21:53.146 --> 21:54.397
(CHIRPING SOUND)

21:54.522 --> 21:55.607
Emma, that better not

21:55.608 --> 21:56.691
be your phone again!

21:56.816 --> 21:58.151
That wasn't my phone.

21:58.276 --> 21:59.716
Of course it was.

21:59.717 --> 22:01.154
What else would it be?

22:01.404 --> 22:02.676
That warble sounded

22:02.677 --> 22:03.948
distinctly bird-like.

22:05.283 --> 22:07.077
- It's coming from
- Bertram's seat.

22:07.202 --> 22:08.578
Hey, hands off my stuff!

22:10.580 --> 22:12.749
(GROANS)

22:12.874 --> 22:13.874
(JESSIE GASPS)

22:14.167 --> 22:16.502
Baby goobies!

22:17.420 --> 22:18.462
Gooblets!

22:21.424 --> 22:23.551
Bertram, we do not

22:23.552 --> 22:25.678
put endangered species

22:21.424 --> 22:25.678
in our carry-ons!

22:26.304 --> 22:27.431
We do if

22:27.432 --> 22:28.556
they're delicious.
