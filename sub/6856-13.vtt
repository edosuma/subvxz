<i>The Republic fleet is on the defensive
and pushed to the brink,</i>

00:21.598 --> 00:24.774
<i>as war rages in the much-contested
outer rim territories.</i>

00:25.599 --> 00:29.570
<i>Chaos and fear mount as the
separatist army rages an epic battle</i>

00:29.971 --> 00:32.195
<i>against heavily outnumbered
Republic ships.</i>

00:32.612 --> 00:34.700
<i>In the far reaches of the quell system,</i>

00:35.034 --> 00:37.551
<i>Anakin Skywalker
and his padawan, Ahsoka,</i>

00:37.676 --> 00:41.283
<i>race across the galaxy
to aid Jedi knight Aayla Secura,</i>

00:41.625 --> 00:43.698
<i>who is in the midst
of a fight for her life</i>

00:43.823 --> 00:46.295
<i>as the sinister droid army closes in.</i>

00:46.783 --> 00:48.333
Our shields are gone.

00:51.158 --> 00:53.135
Hurry, Skywalker.
We're depending on you.

00:56.222 --> 00:57.390
Prepare the gunships.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:07.160 --> 01:08.359
We have them now.

01:08.535 --> 01:09.819
Send in the super droids.

01:19.597 --> 01:21.973
Commander, get out there
and stop those droids.

01:22.098 --> 01:23.098
I'm on it.

01:25.461 --> 01:26.293
This way.

01:28.973 --> 01:30.089
We're ready, admiral.

01:36.725 --> 01:39.265
- General, Skywalker's here.
- And none too soon.

01:39.433 --> 01:40.850
We're entering the atmosphere.

02:04.586 --> 02:05.791
Rocket droids incoming.

02:16.032 --> 02:17.803
Those droids are boarding
Aayla's ship.

02:24.945 --> 02:27.772
Take care of that flanker.
I'll be on board Aayla's cruiser.

02:28.157 --> 02:30.232
Master, are you sure
that's the wisest thing...

02:51.182 --> 02:54.131
- Hey, kid.
- I know, I know. I'm hanging on.

03:02.257 --> 03:04.141
This is taking too long.

03:04.595 --> 03:06.060
Destroy that cruiser.

03:06.535 --> 03:09.735
But, sir, there are still
hundreds of droids on board.

03:10.035 --> 03:11.232
I don't care.

03:11.785 --> 03:12.885
Roger roger.

03:38.547 --> 03:40.450
Nice entrance, Skywalker.

03:41.658 --> 03:44.308
How do you plan
to get us out of this mess?

03:45.034 --> 03:49.288
Well, I have a ship docking
in the lower hanger as we speak.

03:52.394 --> 03:54.066
- Activate docking port.
- On it.

03:57.019 --> 03:57.820
Hold it.

04:05.255 --> 04:06.521
We made it.

04:09.732 --> 04:11.000
Gangway locked in, sir.

04:18.382 --> 04:19.341
It's too late.

04:21.596 --> 04:22.496
Master!

04:31.813 --> 04:34.398
- Don't move the ship.
- Are you guys all right down there?

04:42.532 --> 04:43.908
Ahsoka, we have to leave now.

04:45.533 --> 04:47.468
Hurry. Get him on the ship.

04:49.849 --> 04:52.333
I'm going to turn on
the deflector shields.

04:53.053 --> 04:54.043
Gangway release.

05:03.222 --> 05:05.554
<i>You'll never be able to dock
in the middle of this battle.</i>

05:05.906 --> 05:07.346
We had no choice, admiral.

05:07.471 --> 05:09.658
General Skywalker's condition
may be critical.

05:09.783 --> 05:11.685
We must get him
on board the resolute.

05:12.033 --> 05:13.520
<i>Are all Jedi so reckless?</i>

05:13.719 --> 05:14.939
Just the good ones.

05:24.367 --> 05:26.467
The hyperdrive's been activated.

05:27.347 --> 05:28.911
- Shut it down.
- I can't.

05:30.347 --> 05:33.156
<i>- General Secura, what's going on?
- We're going into hyperspace.</i>

05:33.281 --> 05:35.334
<i>- Detach! Detach!
- They'll take us with them.</i>

05:35.502 --> 05:36.543
Evasive maneuvers.

05:42.518 --> 05:45.093
Plot every course
along their last known trajectory.

05:45.218 --> 05:47.898
We need to finish this battle
and find them.

05:55.658 --> 05:58.440
I need you with commander Bly
up on the bridge right now.

05:58.909 --> 06:02.033
I should stay.
Commander Bly doesn't need my help.

06:02.158 --> 06:03.258
Anakin does.

06:04.158 --> 06:07.116
You can help Anakin
by getting this ship to safety.

06:09.033 --> 06:11.537
- General Secura, we have a problem.
- What is it, commander?

06:12.032 --> 06:14.206
In our haste to escape,
the navicomputer's coordinates

06:14.374 --> 06:18.708
were inputted incorrectly.
And, we're headed right for a star.

06:38.780 --> 06:42.067
It's no use. The navigation computer
is completely fried.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.737
Shut down all power circuits
to reset the coordinates.

06:45.249 --> 06:47.197
That will cut off
Anakin's life support.

06:47.557 --> 06:49.095
I don't like it either,

06:49.220 --> 06:51.910
but it's a risk
we're going to have to take.

06:57.970 --> 07:00.252
We're switching off
primary power units.

07:00.888 --> 07:02.845
Cutting it awfully close.

07:03.098 --> 07:04.757
Ready to shut off auxiliary power.

07:05.844 --> 07:06.744
On three.

07:07.596 --> 07:10.220
One, two,

07:10.388 --> 07:11.402
three.

07:27.020 --> 07:28.947
We're out of hyperspace.
Resume all power.

07:36.734 --> 07:39.041
Switch the power back on.
What are you waiting for?

07:42.675 --> 07:43.908
Hurry. Hurry.

07:57.530 --> 08:01.772
We're not going to crash into the star,
but we're going to hit that planet.

08:29.101 --> 08:30.251
Everyone out!

08:44.217 --> 08:45.763
Well, we made it.

08:46.174 --> 08:48.586
And master Skywalker is still alive.

08:48.725 --> 08:51.780
I'm just glad he wasn't awake
to see that landing.

08:52.349 --> 08:54.074
He would have been proud.

08:55.258 --> 08:57.494
I've certainly perfected
the art of demolishing ships

08:57.792 --> 08:59.955
and almost getting my master killed.

09:15.012 --> 09:18.596
Anakin doesn't have much time.
We have to find help tonight.

09:21.748 --> 09:25.147
You and Bly go south.
Rex and I will stay here with Anakin.

09:25.449 --> 09:26.499
No, Ahsoka.

09:26.948 --> 09:29.568
In order to get help quickly,
we must work together.

09:29.822 --> 09:31.340
I can't leave him.

09:31.465 --> 09:35.115
Master, I know if I was hurt,
he'd never leave me behind.

09:35.512 --> 09:37.412
I know this is hard, Ahsoka,

09:37.725 --> 09:40.940
but Anakin has to stay behind,
and we have to go now.

09:41.636 --> 09:44.136
There is nothing more
we can do for him.

09:46.278 --> 09:49.012
We must do all we can
to get off this planet.

09:49.137 --> 09:52.637
As a Jedi, it is your duty
to do what is best for the group.

10:04.991 --> 10:06.541
General Secura, look.

10:08.864 --> 10:11.427
We're not the only ones here
on this planet.

10:11.552 --> 10:14.535
There has to be some kind
of something here.

10:22.054 --> 10:25.457
If you don't mind me asking, general,
where exactly are we going?

10:25.798 --> 10:27.876
To go find the people
who live on this planet.

10:28.491 --> 10:31.213
Where are we going to find them?
We have no idea where they are.

10:32.553 --> 10:35.532
It seems to me
that the people we're looking for

10:35.657 --> 10:37.891
live near giant trees.

10:38.926 --> 10:40.676
Very perceptive, padawan.

10:42.866 --> 10:44.344
Be strong, master,

10:45.057 --> 10:46.687
just a little bit longer.

10:47.115 --> 10:48.815
Rex will watch over you.

10:49.365 --> 10:51.316
- It is time to go.
- Don't worry, kid.

10:51.677 --> 10:53.527
I'll take good care of him.

10:56.863 --> 10:59.967
Captain Rex, keep your locator on.
We should be back by daybreak

11:00.092 --> 11:02.803
with whoever or whatever lives
on this planet.

11:02.928 --> 11:04.552
Got it, general Secura.

11:04.677 --> 11:06.970
Hey, kid, good luck.

11:07.990 --> 11:09.543
Come on, guys.
Let's move out.

11:19.885 --> 11:24.077
I can still sense your worry for Anakin,
your attachment to him.

11:24.392 --> 11:25.502
It's just...

11:25.954 --> 11:28.106
I get so confused sometimes.

11:28.453 --> 11:31.141
It's forbidden for Jedi
to form attachments,

11:31.266 --> 11:33.734
yet we are supposed
to be compassionate.

11:34.141 --> 11:36.591
It is nothing
to be ashamed of, Ahsoka.

11:37.016 --> 11:39.990
I went through the same process
when I was your age with my own master.

11:40.515 --> 11:41.415
Really?

11:41.703 --> 11:42.578
You?

11:42.703 --> 11:44.553
He was like a father to me.

11:45.014 --> 11:48.040
I realized that for the greater good,
I had to let him go.

11:48.577 --> 11:51.668
Don't lose a thousand lives
just to save one.

11:52.391 --> 11:53.291
Maybe.

11:53.951 --> 11:57.251
But that doesn't mean
that I can't try to save his life.

12:55.232 --> 12:56.858
I don't see any signs of life.

12:58.849 --> 12:59.880
Watch out!

13:04.824 --> 13:06.450
No wonder it's deserted.

13:06.575 --> 13:07.975
It's a death trap.

13:08.199 --> 13:11.849
You'd have to be crazy
to want to dodge those on a daily basis.

13:12.890 --> 13:16.169
It looks like someone or something
intelligent enough to figure out

13:16.337 --> 13:18.713
a use for the pods has dragged them away.

13:19.387 --> 13:22.371
All we have to do is follow the trail.
Let's go.

13:52.645 --> 13:53.707
General?

13:54.675 --> 13:56.075
Are you all right?

13:56.298 --> 13:57.198
Be...

13:57.987 --> 13:58.962
Behind you.

14:00.421 --> 14:01.421
What the...

14:42.735 --> 14:43.757
Watch your left!

15:04.110 --> 15:05.403
Cameron's dead.

15:06.860 --> 15:08.510
So are Lucky and Flesh.

15:11.736 --> 15:13.386
We have to keep moving.

15:48.806 --> 15:50.574
Pod central.
We made it.

16:01.026 --> 16:01.792
Hello?

16:07.986 --> 16:09.676
What have you come here for?

16:10.209 --> 16:13.765
We are peacekeepers.
We are Jedi from the galactic Republic.

16:14.230 --> 16:17.900
Our ship crashed a few miles away,
and one of us is very badly injured.

16:18.384 --> 16:19.477
We need your help.

16:19.970 --> 16:23.648
Violence breeds violence.
Jedi are no peacekeepers.

16:27.399 --> 16:28.737
We're fighting for freedom.

16:29.212 --> 16:32.240
And freedom and peace
require fear and death?

16:34.272 --> 16:38.455
We colonized this system to find solace
from your wretched war.

16:39.087 --> 16:40.937
We came here to find peace.

16:41.650 --> 16:42.900
You must leave.

16:43.025 --> 16:46.504
You will only destroy what small amount
of peace is left in the galaxy.

16:48.150 --> 16:50.216
You will only bring
the destruction of us.

16:50.588 --> 16:53.502
Regardless of the clone wars
and our part in them,

16:53.627 --> 16:55.263
we still need your help.

16:55.804 --> 16:58.774
I'm afraid I must do
what's best for my people.

16:58.899 --> 17:00.349
We cannot help you.

17:01.694 --> 17:02.675
Please.

17:02.972 --> 17:05.022
Can you at least give us
some medical supplies?

17:05.712 --> 17:07.275
My friend is dying.

17:15.026 --> 17:17.126
I cannot ignore a plea for help.

17:17.647 --> 17:20.498
I will send my son Wag Too
to help your friend.

17:20.623 --> 17:23.973
He is a healer.
But only one Jedi may go with him.

17:24.336 --> 17:26.613
The other must stay as insurance.

17:27.056 --> 17:29.506
We wouldn't want
a surprise attack on our village

17:29.837 --> 17:32.008
or the kidnapping
of our only healer.

17:32.901 --> 17:34.401
Bly and I will stay.

17:34.772 --> 17:36.805
Padawan, go and help your master.

17:37.865 --> 17:40.679
The clone and his blaster cannot stay.

17:40.804 --> 17:43.213
- He will go with the young one.
- I can handle it.

17:43.338 --> 17:46.231
I don't need help. Don't worry.

17:46.588 --> 17:49.086
Be mindful of your surroundings,
padawan.

17:49.211 --> 17:51.027
Those creatures are still out there.

17:51.649 --> 17:52.549
Got it.

17:53.900 --> 17:55.250
We won't be long.

18:13.771 --> 18:16.052
Here. It will restore your energy.

18:16.696 --> 18:17.728
Thank you.

18:19.025 --> 18:23.439
I am sure you are aware that the Jedi
did not initiate the clone wars.

18:23.835 --> 18:27.647
Our only intention was to end it
and restore peace to our galaxy.

18:29.835 --> 18:32.939
What difference does it make
who started the war

18:33.064 --> 18:35.015
and who only wants to end it?

18:35.140 --> 18:38.283
No side is free of fault.
It takes two to fight.

18:38.586 --> 18:40.936
But isn't liberty worth fighting for?

18:41.400 --> 18:43.300
But is it worth killing for?

18:43.887 --> 18:46.336
Fighting for something
doesn't necessarily mean

18:46.461 --> 18:49.085
you have to destroy
everything in your path.

18:49.708 --> 18:53.962
Only when you lay your arms down
and pursue a course of nonviolence

18:54.087 --> 18:58.136
can you make this claim to me
that the Jedi are peacekeepers.

19:23.112 --> 19:25.497
General, you need
to maintain your rest.

19:25.989 --> 19:27.856
I can't rest.

19:28.299 --> 19:29.876
Rex, they're coming.

19:30.489 --> 19:31.789
I can hear them.

19:31.927 --> 19:33.127
We must fight.

20:01.846 --> 20:02.784
No, don't.

20:08.849 --> 20:09.623
Fine.

20:23.792 --> 20:25.395
Good work, little guy.

20:28.447 --> 20:29.498
Master!

20:33.644 --> 20:35.307
Good to see you, snips.

20:36.038 --> 20:38.945
This is Wag Too. He's a healer.

20:39.447 --> 20:42.157
- He can make you well again.
- Don't you worry.

20:42.669 --> 20:44.271
I can fix you right up.

21:03.097 --> 21:04.188
Snips?

21:08.370 --> 21:11.352
The oil from the pods
will aid in the healing process.

21:15.267 --> 21:17.801
Don't worry.
You'll be well in no-time.

21:27.038 --> 21:28.953
You were right all along,
master Secura.

21:29.285 --> 21:30.335
About what?

21:30.877 --> 21:32.224
If I had stayed with Anakin,

21:32.349 --> 21:35.960
we probably wouldn't have found
this village in time to save him.

21:38.848 --> 21:41.298
At least
this whole ordeal is over now.

21:44.535 --> 21:47.235
We still have to find
a way off this planet.

21:48.912 --> 21:52.310
Well, I'm sure admiral Yularen and
the Republic fleet are looking for us.

21:53.222 --> 21:55.922
It shouldn't take them too long
to get here.

22:02.079 --> 22:04.151
<i>Every Jedi knows
you cannot save someone</i>

22:04.413 --> 22:06.373
<i>who doesn't want to be saved.</i>

22:06.826 --> 22:07.954
Droids inbound!

22:08.781 --> 22:10.745
<i>We're stranded
on an uncharted world,</i>

22:11.080 --> 22:13.133
<i>and the locals refuse to fight.</i>

22:13.499 --> 22:15.612
<i>Your presence here endangers us.</i>

22:16.422 --> 22:18.878
<i>But young Skywalker
will not give up on them.</i>

22:19.354 --> 22:21.835
<i>He just might be good enough
