00:30.846 --> 00:35.349
<i>In my lifetime,
I've only fallen in love twice.</i>

00:35.351 --> 00:40.019
<i>The first time led to betrayal,
murder and suicide.</i>

00:40.021 --> 00:44.791
<i>The second time
was three days ago.</i>

00:44.793 --> 00:49.565
<i>And meeting her would
prove far more tragic.</i>

00:56.638 --> 00:59.208
<i>Where's my Romeo?</i>

01:04.379 --> 01:06.947
<i>What's here?</i>

01:06.949 --> 01:09.719
<i>Poison, I see,
has been his timeless end.</i>

01:15.424 --> 01:19.895
<i>O' churl, drunk all, and left no
friendly drop to help me after.</i>

01:22.431 --> 01:24.898
<i>Thy lips are warm.</i>

01:24.900 --> 01:29.472
<i>O' happy dagger,
there rust and let me die!</i>

03:54.582 --> 03:57.083
Hey, can you hear me?

03:57.085 --> 03:59.821
Yeah, the convention's
going great.

04:00.889 --> 04:03.590
San Francisco?

04:03.592 --> 04:06.660
It's good.
Chilly, but nice.

04:06.662 --> 04:09.095
<i>Hey, I gotta go.
They're calling us back in.</i>

04:09.097 --> 04:11.701
<i>Love you too.</i>

05:11.659 --> 05:13.628
Hi there.

05:15.830 --> 05:17.866
What are you listening to?

05:18.900 --> 05:20.667
Nothing, actually.

05:20.669 --> 05:22.135
I just put these on
hoping it will

05:22.137 --> 05:24.540
deter people like you
from talking to me.

05:26.674 --> 05:28.308
You're so funny.

05:28.310 --> 05:30.046
Am I?

05:31.779 --> 05:33.647
You know, just...

05:33.649 --> 05:36.683
I just saw you there
sitting alone and I think,

05:36.685 --> 05:38.754
- "Oh my god you're s..."
- Beautiful.

05:40.022 --> 05:42.222
Oh yes, but not just beautiful.

05:42.224 --> 05:45.592
- You know, I think it's like...
- Love at first sight.

05:45.594 --> 05:47.893
Exactly.

05:47.895 --> 05:51.698
How do you know it was love, and not
just a chemical response in the brain

05:51.700 --> 05:53.333
caused by erotic stimuli?

05:53.335 --> 05:57.203
After all, the only difference
between love and lust,

05:57.205 --> 05:59.138
is that the first one
requires the intent

05:59.140 --> 06:01.941
of being with one, and only one,
significant other.

06:01.943 --> 06:04.109
So unless you're gonna
drop down on one knee

06:04.111 --> 06:06.712
and pledge your
everlasting love to me,

06:06.714 --> 06:09.851
do me the honor
of fucking off.

06:13.722 --> 06:14.991
Bitch.

07:13.782 --> 07:15.148
Why are you following me?

07:15.150 --> 07:17.887
Sorry, I have a message
from Father.

08:18.779 --> 08:20.880
Rough day?

08:20.882 --> 08:23.319
You could say that.

08:29.291 --> 08:31.993
I hope you didn't finish
that whole bottle by yourself.

08:33.861 --> 08:35.394
Hmph.

08:35.395 --> 08:37.866
This one still
has a little bit left.

08:44.740 --> 08:46.873
I get the sense that you don't
want company right now,

08:46.875 --> 08:48.508
but...

08:48.510 --> 08:50.976
leaving you drunk
on the edge of a perilous cliff

08:50.978 --> 08:53.948
doesn't seem like the best idea.

08:55.851 --> 08:57.352
Fine.

08:59.121 --> 09:02.390
You stay. I'll go.

09:36.924 --> 09:38.925
Amaltheo!

09:38.927 --> 09:41.297
Who's Amaltheo?

09:42.930 --> 09:44.898
God damn it,
where are you?!

09:44.900 --> 09:48.471
- I'll get you some water.
- I don't need any fucking water.

10:01.949 --> 10:03.985
Don't look at me like that.

10:04.952 --> 10:06.018
Like what?

10:06.020 --> 10:08.790
Like you care.

10:20.467 --> 10:23.335
Here, I'll get your hair...

10:23.337 --> 10:26.808
Shit!
I'll call an ambulance!

10:29.144 --> 10:30.976
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

10:30.978 --> 10:33.079
- I'm her nurse.
- Okay well, she needs help.

10:33.081 --> 10:34.848
She's vomiting blood
and she's super drunk.

10:34.850 --> 10:36.181
- I'll take care of it.
- Take care of it?

10:36.183 --> 10:38.917
I said I'll take care of it.

10:38.919 --> 10:41.055
And don't ever come back.

10:44.425 --> 10:48.161
It's okay, <i>agape mou.</i>
Everything is going to be okay.

10:48.163 --> 10:50.997
- Where were you?
- Looking for you.

10:50.999 --> 10:53.365
You've never
missed a sunset before.

10:53.367 --> 10:56.002
He knows.

10:56.004 --> 10:57.537
Who knows?

10:57.539 --> 11:01.007
Father. He knows
where Romeo's buried.

11:01.009 --> 11:03.176
That's nonsense, my dear.

11:03.178 --> 11:05.014
He's just trying to rile you up.

11:06.448 --> 11:09.385
This is the ring
I told you about.

11:11.419 --> 11:14.220
The one I gave him
on our wedding night.

11:14.222 --> 11:18.191
My promise that
I would be his forever.

11:18.193 --> 11:20.292
Let's not talk about it now,
my dear.

11:20.294 --> 11:24.065
We need to clean you up and
get you feeling better first.

12:09.077 --> 12:11.179
Hello?

12:14.949 --> 12:16.551
Hello?

12:54.121 --> 12:56.391
What are you doing here?

12:59.461 --> 13:01.594
I'm sorry. I knocked.

13:01.596 --> 13:05.100
I know. Not answering
felt like a hint.

13:06.101 --> 13:07.133
You're okay.

13:07.135 --> 13:09.402
Yes, I'm fine.

13:09.404 --> 13:11.436
You were vomiting blood.

13:11.438 --> 13:15.243
Blood? I was drinking
red wine all night.

13:17.145 --> 13:18.447
What happened to him?

13:19.514 --> 13:22.614
He cut himself on glass.

13:22.616 --> 13:24.383
He looks sick.

13:24.385 --> 13:26.119
And you thought
I was vomiting blood,

13:26.121 --> 13:28.687
so maybe medicine
isn't your forte.

13:28.689 --> 13:30.725
Well, I'm glad you're okay.

13:34.129 --> 13:35.397
Thank you.

13:37.198 --> 13:39.168
For checking in.

13:41.135 --> 13:42.737
Farryn.

13:43.804 --> 13:45.440
My name's Farryn.

13:46.674 --> 13:48.510
Juliet.

13:50.178 --> 13:52.347
Hi, Juliet.

13:54.816 --> 13:57.082
You need to leave.

13:57.084 --> 13:58.618
Huh.

13:58.620 --> 14:01.590
For 10 seconds there
you were almost likable.

14:09.230 --> 14:11.533
You told her your name.

14:13.834 --> 14:15.234
What's in a name?

14:15.236 --> 14:18.204
In your case, everything.

14:18.206 --> 14:19.707
She knows more
than she should.

14:24.813 --> 14:28.214
Perhaps it is fate
handing you a gift.

14:28.216 --> 14:31.783
The girl is
traveling alone.

14:31.785 --> 14:35.720
Someone helps me home and
you want me to take her life?

14:35.722 --> 14:38.224
I want you to be
with the man you love.

14:38.226 --> 14:40.359
If I complete
the transformation,

14:40.361 --> 14:43.229
like Father wants,
I could lose my humanity,

14:43.231 --> 14:45.297
my capacity to love.

14:45.299 --> 14:48.801
Your love for Romeo hasn't
dwindled for eight centuries.

14:48.803 --> 14:51.436
Completing the transformation
didn't cause your father,

14:51.438 --> 14:54.574
or cousin, or any of them
to stop loving.

14:54.576 --> 14:58.047
They just never knew
how to love in the first place.

14:59.547 --> 15:01.814
You can't give up hope.

15:01.816 --> 15:06.221
Loving someone means doing everything
that you can to be with that person.

15:21.302 --> 15:24.406
I see you're
still reading fantasy.

15:25.807 --> 15:29.742
I don't remember inviting you.

15:29.744 --> 15:32.811
Since when does family
need an invitation, Cousin?

15:32.813 --> 15:35.818
Since they're not
really family, Cousin.

15:38.153 --> 15:41.123
Blood is blood, Cousin.

15:42.356 --> 15:45.457
Father requests your presence.

15:45.459 --> 15:47.325
Since when does Father request?

15:47.327 --> 15:49.795
Then consider it a demand.

15:49.797 --> 15:52.764
He won't allow you
to say 'no' this time.

15:52.766 --> 15:55.567
Then I'll have to think of
another way of telling him,

15:55.569 --> 15:57.335
perhaps a hand gesture.

15:57.337 --> 16:00.406
I have just the finger in mind.

16:00.408 --> 16:02.340
I will relish the moment

16:02.342 --> 16:03.843
when Father finally allows me

16:03.845 --> 16:06.412
to rip that smug smile
off your face.

16:06.414 --> 16:08.848
Thank you for the message,
Cousin.

16:08.850 --> 16:11.216
You make
a marvelous errand boy.

16:11.218 --> 16:14.320
Give my regards
to the family,

16:14.322 --> 16:16.390
or what's left of them.

16:43.483 --> 16:45.417
Read your future
in the coffee grinds?

16:45.419 --> 16:48.387
No thank you.

16:48.389 --> 16:51.193
The future is nothing to fear.

16:59.266 --> 17:02.803
Why is it a pretty girl
like you here all alone?

17:04.505 --> 17:06.839
I was hoping you could
tell me that.

17:06.840 --> 17:09.611
I don't tell things
you already know.

17:16.717 --> 17:19.584
Fate has already chosen
your future,

17:19.586 --> 17:23.255
but the way you get there will
be as interesting as the ending.

17:23.257 --> 17:27.392
There is a line going all the
way around from past to future,

17:27.394 --> 17:28.793
from good to bad,
that's very rare...

17:28.795 --> 17:32.200
Sorry,
do you mind if we stop?

17:33.400 --> 17:35.734
But we're almost done.

17:35.736 --> 17:39.507
I know. It's just...
sometimes it's nice not to know.

18:00.294 --> 18:03.428
She continues to be insolent,
Father.

18:03.430 --> 18:04.929
Why do you allow her
to insult us?

18:04.931 --> 18:08.333
The only insult is a son
who's no more useful

18:08.335 --> 18:10.671
at bringing down a mule.

18:12.306 --> 18:15.409
It's time for a more
persuasive message.

18:45.473 --> 18:46.908
Sorry,
I don't speak Greek.

18:50.445 --> 18:51.976
Excuse me.

18:51.978 --> 18:54.847
It's a little early
for a dance, huh?

18:54.849 --> 18:56.784
Look,
I don't want any trouble.

19:03.524 --> 19:05.925
When a whore touches a prince,

19:05.927 --> 19:09.494
her hands are removed
and her eyes plucked.

19:09.496 --> 19:12.031
You can have my money,
just please let me go!

19:12.033 --> 19:14.367
Money? Money...

19:14.369 --> 19:17.903
I want something
far more valuable.

19:25.112 --> 19:27.812
Then I'll assume you received
Father's message,

19:27.814 --> 19:31.687
and I will see you soon.

20:05.786 --> 20:08.686
<i>Now you have no choice.</i>

20:08.688 --> 20:11.689
Don't be so dramatic.

20:11.691 --> 20:13.626
She'll tell someone.

20:13.628 --> 20:15.561
Who's going to believe her?

20:15.563 --> 20:18.062
Someone. Anyone.

20:18.064 --> 20:20.733
Maybe no one in America,
but here...

20:20.735 --> 20:23.135
there is far more
history here.

20:23.137 --> 20:26.539
And far more hatred.

20:26.541 --> 20:29.010
I know the history.

20:30.210 --> 20:31.976
If I take someone's life,

20:31.978 --> 20:35.080
it's gonna be someone
who deserves it.

20:35.082 --> 20:38.551
Besides, she's probably
halfway back to America by now.

20:40.220 --> 20:43.525
Juliet? It's me, Farryn.

20:45.860 --> 20:49.695
You shouldn't have come back.

20:49.697 --> 20:51.897
You shouldn't have saved me.

20:51.899 --> 20:54.669
That's a mistake
I can easily rectify.

20:59.474 --> 21:01.576
You're not safe here.

21:04.178 --> 21:05.781
I feel safe.

21:07.547 --> 21:09.583
What you feel is irrelevant.

21:11.819 --> 21:14.619
There's a gathering
in two days.

21:14.621 --> 21:17.092
Cousin has your scent.

21:18.626 --> 21:20.626
You won't last a day.

21:20.628 --> 21:22.831
I would if you turned me.

21:23.663 --> 21:25.933
Go home.

21:29.536 --> 21:31.605
And if I don't?

21:44.084 --> 21:46.188
Why do you want to be turned?

21:48.022 --> 21:50.656
I think you know the answer.

21:50.658 --> 21:52.657
Life is too short, right?

21:52.659 --> 21:57.032
There's so many amazing things
you want to experience.

21:58.666 --> 22:01.266
You make it sound so dreary.

22:01.268 --> 22:04.168
I'll let you in
on a little secret,

22:04.170 --> 22:06.972
life always ends
the same way,

22:06.974 --> 22:10.111
with humanity destroying
anything beautiful.

22:12.679 --> 22:16.215
Maybe... but despite it all,

22:16.217 --> 22:19.118
there still is a lot
of beauty left in the world.

22:19.120 --> 22:22.154
Didn't used to see it,
but now I do.

22:22.156 --> 22:27.229
Let me guess, that's why
you always carry your camera.

22:29.563 --> 22:32.700
I'm sorry you don't
see it anymore.

22:34.601 --> 22:37.703
But as jaded as you pretend
to be about the world,

22:37.705 --> 22:41.874
I think that deep down, you
don't really want to believe it.

22:41.876 --> 22:44.310
Where you see beauty,

22:44.312 --> 22:48.080
I see life,
plucked from earth

22:48.082 --> 22:50.986
and slowly wilting away.

22:52.687 --> 22:56.722
I've seen hundreds of
thousands of people die.

22:56.724 --> 23:00.626
There was once a boy
in Marseille...

23:00.628 --> 23:03.928
he couldn't have been
more than thirteen years old.

23:03.930 --> 23:05.863
He was playing the flute
at the front

23:05.865 --> 23:09.167
of a battle regiment
during the French Revolution.

23:09.169 --> 23:11.736
He was proud to be
serving his country,

23:11.738 --> 23:14.039
twiddling away
at his instrument.

23:14.041 --> 23:16.609
So focused,
as if any wrong note

23:16.611 --> 23:20.678
could somehow influence
the outcome.

23:20.680 --> 23:24.952
That's when a cannonball tore
through the lower half of his body.

23:33.928 --> 23:36.931
He was still alive
when I found him.

23:41.235 --> 23:45.806
His insides were
spilled on the dirt.

23:47.041 --> 23:50.876
His legs were shreds of meat.

23:50.878 --> 23:55.313
His stomach laid by his side,
squirming as he cried.

23:55.315 --> 23:59.318
He did everything he could
to hold onto his life,

23:59.320 --> 24:01.954
but what that little boy
didn't understand,

24:01.956 --> 24:05.327
is that when you've lost so much of
yourself there's no point in living.

24:12.699 --> 24:14.733
If you're so miserable
why do you go on?

24:14.735 --> 24:16.201
We didn't come here
to talk about me.

24:16.203 --> 24:17.836
No, we came here
so you can dissuade me.

24:17.838 --> 24:20.805
And yet, here you still are.

24:20.807 --> 24:25.343
Living forever means you have to
watch everyone you ever loved die.

24:25.345 --> 24:28.015
Better than them
watching us die.

24:37.992 --> 24:41.292
Juliet, love, I can't keep
increasing the dosage.

24:41.294 --> 24:43.931
It's strong enough to kill a...

24:56.243 --> 24:59.211
<i>Have you ever lost anyone?</i>

24:59.213 --> 25:02.947
Yeah, my mom.
This ring was hers.

25:02.949 --> 25:06.851
She got so thin that one day
it just slid off her finger.

25:06.853 --> 25:09.154
I promised her I'd hold onto it
until she got better,

25:09.156 --> 25:13.395
but she knew that was
as much a lie as I did.

25:17.031 --> 25:20.335
I watched her waste away
for two full years...

25:23.437 --> 25:27.074
and lost two years
of my life in the process.

25:29.243 --> 25:32.077
And you still think
life is beautiful?

25:32.079 --> 25:35.414
I don't regret spending
a single minute with her,

25:35.416 --> 25:40.218
but I don't want to waste
another minute of this life.

25:40.220 --> 25:43.455
I've forgotten what it's like
to have an expiration date.

25:43.457 --> 25:50.061
I mean, I will someday, it just
seems too far to even imagine.

25:50.063 --> 25:54.500
I'm not immortal, I just age
at a much slower rate.

25:54.502 --> 25:56.303
So...

25:57.938 --> 26:00.505
if you're not immortal,
can you be...

26:00.507 --> 26:02.940
Killed?

26:02.942 --> 26:08.415
Fire, decapitation,
dead blood.

26:10.918 --> 26:14.418
We've become what we are
because our blood has mutated.

26:14.420 --> 26:18.122
Evolved. But there are
negatives too.

26:18.124 --> 26:20.359
We lose our ability
to see color,

26:20.361 --> 26:25.363
and well, our tastes,
they're quite particular.

26:25.365 --> 26:27.933
Human blood.

26:27.935 --> 26:31.936
Yes, but I refuse to hunt,

26:31.938 --> 26:35.573
to take a human's life.

26:35.575 --> 26:39.444
Oh, so that's where
Amaltheo comes in.

26:39.446 --> 26:44.986
He's like a
traveling lunch box?

27:16.316 --> 27:18.951
I've had nurses
like Amaltheo before,

27:18.953 --> 27:23.491
but he's the only one who never
asked to be turned, so I kept him.

27:26.293 --> 27:29.093
I promise you I won't
squander this gift.

27:29.095 --> 27:32.164
I'll write the next
great concerto or...

27:32.166 --> 27:33.999
study medicine
and finally find a...

27:34.001 --> 27:36.001
Let's not talk about the future.

27:36.003 --> 27:38.973
In a couple of days
our lives will change forever.

27:40.341 --> 27:43.274
You claim to love living
in the moment,

27:43.276 --> 27:48.216
if you only had two days, how
would you like to spend them?

27:55.555 --> 27:57.923
Okay, so this is a song I wrote.

27:57.925 --> 28:01.392
It's my first time
performing it, uh...

28:01.394 --> 28:05.930
it's my first time
performing period, so, um...

28:05.932 --> 28:10.034
Okay, here it goes.
Something or...

28:10.036 --> 28:11.271
nothing.

28:13.040 --> 28:15.176
I'll just sing now.

Good stuff, good stuff.

29:54.475 --> 29:56.207
Not bad.

29:56.209 --> 29:59.613
Ehm,
Juliet.

30:01.782 --> 30:03.615
Juliet?

30:03.617 --> 30:05.550
Did I forget to mention that?

30:05.552 --> 30:07.421
Juliet?

30:09.255 --> 30:12.290
Uh, this way, Juliet.
Ah...

30:12.292 --> 30:14.458
Sorry.

30:14.460 --> 30:17.728
- Hey.
- I did not agree to this.

30:17.730 --> 30:20.698
You asked me what I wanted
to do if I had two days left.

30:20.700 --> 30:23.068
But the real question is,
what would you do?

30:23.070 --> 30:24.668
- Not this.
- No,

30:24.670 --> 30:27.571
you'd rather mope around
and never do anything new.

30:27.573 --> 30:30.077
I've performed before.

30:31.078 --> 30:33.344
When?

30:33.346 --> 30:36.615
When I was eleven.

30:36.617 --> 30:40.185
So a thousand years ago?

30:40.187 --> 30:42.423
I'm not that old.

32:14.581 --> 32:16.281
You knew da Vinci?

32:16.283 --> 32:18.483
I modeled for him once.

32:18.485 --> 32:20.385
You modeled for da Vinci?

32:20.387 --> 32:22.486
He was actually one of
the few humans

32:22.488 --> 32:25.425
I ever thought
were fascinating.

32:27.226 --> 32:29.160
You slept with da Vinci?!

32:29.162 --> 32:30.832
Um...

32:34.301 --> 32:38.403
Relax, he had
far different taste.

32:38.405 --> 32:42.674
But I won't lie, I did go for a
rebellious streak once I got turned.

32:42.676 --> 32:44.712
How long of a streak?

32:45.946 --> 32:47.615
Mmm, a century or two.

32:50.650 --> 32:52.317
How many people
have you slept with?

33:22.282 --> 33:23.982
What are you doing?

33:23.984 --> 33:28.489
I'm sorry, I just thought
you, me, the sunset...

33:32.359 --> 33:34.328
I have to go.

33:35.428 --> 33:38.733
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

33:58.384 --> 34:02.920
That's twice you've
missed the sunset.

34:02.922 --> 34:05.557
I hope you're not starting to
develop feelings for this girl.

34:05.559 --> 34:08.425
Of course not,
it's just I pity her.

34:08.427 --> 34:09.893
Hmm.

34:09.896 --> 34:13.534
Don't forget, she's just
a means to an end.

34:15.034 --> 34:16.803
What if I turn her?

34:18.639 --> 34:20.704
You said you would
never do that.

34:20.706 --> 34:22.672
That's what you told me.

34:22.675 --> 34:25.411
And after a couple of days...

34:27.847 --> 34:31.382
You made a pledge
to the man you loved.

34:31.385 --> 34:32.850
It is not the same thing.

34:32.851 --> 34:35.418
You want to share your body,
your blood,

34:35.420 --> 34:38.489
your very existence with her,
I don't see how it isn't.

34:38.492 --> 34:39.956
I've slept with
other people before.

34:39.958 --> 34:41.824
But you never cared about them.

34:41.827 --> 34:45.329
This is so, ordinary.

34:45.331 --> 34:47.666
And you're extraordinary.

34:47.668 --> 34:49.800
That girl is not
good enough for you,

34:49.802 --> 34:51.870
and certainly not
for your family.

34:51.871 --> 34:56.474
Now you get to choose
who is and isn't worthy?

34:56.476 --> 34:59.376
No.

34:59.378 --> 35:02.613
I don't get
to choose anything.

35:02.615 --> 35:04.481
Never have.

35:04.483 --> 35:07.320
What's that
supposed to mean?

35:07.954 --> 35:09.490
Nothing.

35:12.492 --> 35:15.363
Do whatever
you think is best.

35:16.630 --> 35:18.965
I'll be here
when you get hungry.

35:42.488 --> 35:45.490
Up kind of early,
aren't you?

35:45.492 --> 35:48.526
I make it a point to never miss
a sunrise or a sunset anymore.

35:48.528 --> 35:51.629
The colors are so vivid
they almost don't seem real.

35:51.631 --> 35:53.934
I wouldn't know.

35:55.602 --> 35:58.403
Do you still remember
any colors?

35:58.405 --> 36:00.637
I think so.

36:00.639 --> 36:04.541
I remember my eyes
are dark brown.

36:04.543 --> 36:07.711
I remember how rosy cheeks
got on pale skin

36:07.713 --> 36:09.914
after running in the garden.

36:09.916 --> 36:12.720
But I don't remember sunrise.

36:21.660 --> 36:24.528
Right around the sun
it's bright yellow,

36:24.530 --> 36:29.733
then it fades to a bright
orange, to a burnt orange,

36:29.735 --> 36:32.403
but when the orange
hits the clouds,

36:32.405 --> 36:34.472
it immediately gets swallowed up
by this bluish gray,

36:34.474 --> 36:36.807
and then fades into purple,

36:36.809 --> 36:39.412
right where that bird
just flew by.

36:40.814 --> 36:43.050
And there's a streak
of white...

37:39.539 --> 37:43.910
Centuries ago, I told someone
the story of my heartbreak.

37:45.579 --> 37:47.245
He was an English writer,

37:47.247 --> 37:52.019
a womanizing drunk, with a
tongue as sharp as a blade.

37:53.619 --> 37:55.086
I don't know why I told him.

37:55.088 --> 37:58.122
Or at least
I like to think I don't.

37:58.124 --> 38:01.059
He took my story
and published it,

38:01.061 --> 38:04.629
and made it one of the most
famous love stories ever told.

38:04.631 --> 38:06.967
His name was
William Shakespeare.

38:09.102 --> 38:11.672
Juliet?

38:14.240 --> 38:17.041
That's impossible.
At the end of the play she...

38:17.043 --> 38:19.644
Killed myself.

38:19.646 --> 38:21.646
That part is true.

38:21.648 --> 38:23.615
Or at least I tried.

38:23.617 --> 38:26.050
Seems my flare for the dramatic
was only superseded

38:26.052 --> 38:29.653
by my lack of knowledge
of basic anatomy.

38:29.655 --> 38:31.523
I would have died eventually,

38:31.525 --> 38:36.197
more slowly and painfully
than I had hoped.

38:44.037 --> 38:46.607
That's when he turned me.

38:49.709 --> 38:52.109
The one we call "Father".

38:52.111 --> 38:56.983
I hate him every single day for not
leaving me to die in that tomb.

39:00.686 --> 39:03.723
And what about Romeo?

39:04.957 --> 39:07.325
After I was turned,

39:07.327 --> 39:10.531
I tried to find
where he was buried.

39:12.698 --> 39:16.733
I looked everywhere,
hoping to die by his side,

39:16.735 --> 39:19.003
but I never found him.

39:19.005 --> 39:20.271
I figured he must've been burnt

39:20.273 --> 39:23.908
with the victims
of the plague.

39:23.910 --> 39:26.945
But it seems Father
has finally found him.

39:26.947 --> 39:29.347
And the only way
he will tell me where

39:29.349 --> 39:34.852
is if I complete
my full transformation.

39:34.854 --> 39:39.093
You're going to keep your promise
to die by his side, aren't you?

39:43.296 --> 39:46.064
<i>This vile
around my neck contains</i>

39:46.066 --> 39:48.932
the exact same poison
that took my beloveds life.

39:48.934 --> 39:51.001
Although I've grown immune
to the poison,

39:51.003 --> 39:54.338
I drink it during sunset,
to remember our love.

39:54.340 --> 39:58.175
But memories fade,
and after all this time,

39:58.177 --> 40:01.745
the only ones I still have left
are the ones on those pages,

40:01.747 --> 40:05.617
floating somewhere
between real life and fantasy.

40:05.619 --> 40:07.986
Sometimes I wonder

40:07.988 --> 40:13.294
if our love was also...
just made up.

40:16.061 --> 40:20.934
Maybe we were just stupid kids
making terrible choices.

40:22.334 --> 40:24.938
I mean, at that age,
who really knows?

40:27.773 --> 40:30.675
But your love was real.

40:30.677 --> 40:33.180
I can see it in the way
you talk about him.

40:35.715 --> 40:37.617
Maybe...

40:38.751 --> 40:41.151
but if our love was real,

40:41.153 --> 40:44.190
and if it was
"once in a lifetime"...

40:46.325 --> 40:51.698
then why am I having those exact
same feelings now for someone else?

40:56.802 --> 40:59.272
I'm not trying to replace him.

41:00.740 --> 41:02.343
I know.

41:04.276 --> 41:07.144
Besides...

41:07.146 --> 41:10.347
<i>Farryn and Juliet</i>
is an awful title for a book.

41:12.184 --> 41:13.853
Ow!

41:18.825 --> 41:20.928
Are you okay?

41:22.428 --> 41:24.394
Yeah, are you okay?

41:24.396 --> 41:27.133
Of course, I'm okay.

41:28.968 --> 41:32.704
It's not like I see everyone
as a talking filet mignon.

41:33.872 --> 41:35.439
Go wash up.

41:35.441 --> 41:37.110
I'll be right back.

42:26.092 --> 42:28.459
- You lied to me!
- What are talking about?

42:28.461 --> 42:31.796
Why didn't you tell me?
Your blood, I tasted it.

42:31.798 --> 42:34.068
Tell you what?

42:37.236 --> 42:40.338
Okay, okay, I'm sick.

42:40.340 --> 42:42.539
I don't have long.

42:42.541 --> 42:44.343
I know.

42:45.912 --> 42:48.945
That's why you didn't run.

42:48.947 --> 42:52.182
That's why you
wanted me to turn you.

42:52.184 --> 42:54.885
What's the difference
if I live six weeks or six...

42:54.887 --> 42:57.957
It makes all the difference.

42:59.057 --> 43:01.792
I can't change you.

43:01.794 --> 43:04.896
Even if I wanted to,
I couldn't.

43:04.898 --> 43:09.934
Your blood,
your immune system is fucked.

43:09.936 --> 43:13.874
Not only would you
probably die, so would I.

43:49.508 --> 43:52.108
Oh babe,

43:52.110 --> 43:55.381
tell me what this vile bitch did
to break your heart.

43:57.983 --> 44:00.553
She does not deserve
your tears,

44:03.523 --> 44:05.793
or your pain.

44:09.329 --> 44:13.997
The love you and Romeo had
was unlike anything this world

44:13.999 --> 44:19.102
has ever or will ever see again.

44:19.104 --> 44:22.340
Your love was
once in a lifetime.

44:22.342 --> 44:27.510
Even your lifetime. Never forget
how beautiful that was.

44:27.512 --> 44:31.381
And never forget your promise
to do anything and everything

44:31.383 --> 44:34.554
within your power
to be with him.

44:40.593 --> 44:46.466
In the end, everyone
will get what they want.

45:21.034 --> 45:23.336
What do you want?

45:25.604 --> 45:27.640
To apologize.

45:29.008 --> 45:31.111
To see you again.

45:35.648 --> 45:39.186
When my mom told us she had
cancer everything changed.

45:40.218 --> 45:42.153
Not just her health,

45:42.155 --> 45:45.455
but the way people treated her,

45:45.457 --> 45:47.291
fluffing her pillows,

45:47.293 --> 45:51.030
asking her how she was feeling
a hundred times a day.

45:53.099 --> 45:56.102
Everyone looking at her the way
you're looking at me now.

46:01.573 --> 46:05.142
I haven't told anyone
I have leukemia.

46:05.144 --> 46:07.410
Not even my dad.

46:07.412 --> 46:10.113
He thinks I'm at a
conference in San Francisco.

46:15.320 --> 46:19.025
I didn't know turning me
could kill you.

46:20.258 --> 46:22.325
Actually that's not true,
I...

46:22.327 --> 46:24.160
Maybe I just didn't want
to believe it, or you know,

46:24.162 --> 46:26.062
maybe deep down
I just really didn't care,

46:26.064 --> 46:27.967
I don't know.

46:29.602 --> 46:32.706
All I know is that
I wasn't ready to die.

46:36.142 --> 46:40.144
Clinging to life just like that
little boy on the battlefield, huh?

46:40.146 --> 46:42.316
It's human nature.

46:43.615 --> 46:45.217
Yeah.

46:47.052 --> 46:49.121
But so is forgiveness.

46:50.722 --> 46:53.259
And then what?

46:55.160 --> 46:57.160
I'm supposed to
say I love you back?

46:57.162 --> 46:59.195
And we will live
happily ever after for a week

46:59.197 --> 47:01.400
before I watch you
wither away and die?

47:06.072 --> 47:08.407
Then don't watch me die.

47:13.479 --> 47:16.312
You said we only had two days,
right?

47:16.314 --> 47:20.283
I think we still have
a few hours left.

47:20.285 --> 47:22.586
Let's make them count!

47:22.588 --> 47:26.727
And then you can go back to your tragic
ending, and then I'll go back to mine.

47:44.577 --> 47:46.313
Juliet?

51:21.459 --> 51:23.829
Time's up.

51:27.465 --> 51:31.769
Then let's run away together.

51:31.771 --> 51:34.437
It doesn't matter
if we have one month,

51:34.439 --> 51:38.041
or one week,
or just one day.

51:38.043 --> 51:41.480
At least we'll be
together for that time.

51:44.316 --> 51:46.485
What about Romeo?

51:50.456 --> 51:52.689
I once dreamt

51:52.691 --> 51:56.926
that when he died
he was turned into stars,

51:56.928 --> 52:02.899
and put in the heavens above so
everyone could admire his beauty.

52:02.901 --> 52:07.437
The setting sun was always
a painful reminder of his loss.

52:07.439 --> 52:10.474
But now I realize
he's not in some crypt,

52:10.476 --> 52:16.316
but up there,
more brilliant than ever.

52:18.617 --> 52:22.055
And in some way I think
he brought me to you.

52:23.622 --> 52:27.527
So that I could be happy
once again.

54:38.858 --> 54:42.992
Ah, my darling Juliet.

54:42.994 --> 54:47.566
The brightness of your cheeks
would shame the stars.

54:48.534 --> 54:49.533
Let her go.

54:49.535 --> 54:51.033
Her?

54:51.035 --> 54:54.637
Up 'til now
it was just him and only him.

54:54.639 --> 54:56.575
How fickle the heart is.

54:59.110 --> 55:02.613
We got so much
to catch up on.

55:02.615 --> 55:05.649
How rude of me, I haven't even
offered you a drink yet.

55:05.651 --> 55:07.153
I don't want a drink.

55:08.220 --> 55:10.887
And yet you'll have one.

55:10.889 --> 55:13.225
Funny how leverage works.

55:22.200 --> 55:27.271
There's nothing like
fresh young blood.

55:27.273 --> 55:31.878
I can't imagine feeding off the same
withering old man like you have.

55:36.849 --> 55:40.253
I guess it would be
like a dog...

55:44.088 --> 55:48.494
eating the same
dry canned food...

55:53.064 --> 55:55.869
over and over again...

55:56.869 --> 55:59.905
day in, day out.

56:33.872 --> 56:38.742
I haven't seen your cheeks
so flushed and alive

56:38.744 --> 56:41.014
since the day you turned.

56:52.191 --> 56:56.292
I remember these family reunions
being far more impressive.

56:56.294 --> 56:59.566
Soon it will be just
you and me, huh, Father?

57:01.767 --> 57:04.334
That's why I'm here isn't it?

57:04.336 --> 57:06.939
You can't turn people anymore.

57:12.778 --> 57:16.412
Maybe you're the one who should
have stuck to canned food.

57:16.414 --> 57:18.951
- Father...
- Enough!

57:22.787 --> 57:24.887
Did you really think
that I was going to

57:24.889 --> 57:27.658
let you get away
with that American girl?

57:27.660 --> 57:30.994
With my bloodline?

57:30.996 --> 57:35.298
Don't you know by now that
you cannot keep secrets from me?

57:35.300 --> 57:40.102
That I got spies everywhere?

57:56.021 --> 58:00.323
Ah, there it is,
that human emotion

58:00.325 --> 58:03.830
you're so desperately
trying to cling on to.

58:05.064 --> 58:06.997
Why?

58:06.999 --> 58:09.765
To have what you
always seem to take for granted,

58:09.767 --> 58:11.968
a place by our side.

58:11.970 --> 58:14.838
All you had to do
is what he wanted.

58:14.840 --> 58:16.073
What about what I wanted?

58:16.075 --> 58:19.843
You!
It's always about you!

58:19.845 --> 58:22.345
I gave up my life for you,

58:22.347 --> 58:25.215
so you waste all the gifts
you were given.

58:25.217 --> 58:27.850
I watched myself
get old and wrinkled,

58:27.852 --> 58:31.854
for the aches and pains as I
stitched my flabby skin together,

58:31.856 --> 58:35.492
day in and day out, while you
stayed young and beautiful.

58:35.494 --> 58:38.028
And you never realize
how lucky you are.

58:38.030 --> 58:42.164
And then, after all that,
you leave me for her.

58:42.166 --> 58:45.102
You could have offered
to turn me,

58:45.104 --> 58:47.437
but no, you had

58:47.439 --> 58:51.344
to be the same rebellious,
selfish brat you've always been.

58:53.144 --> 58:55.412
I will never turn him.

58:55.414 --> 58:57.847
Him?

58:57.849 --> 59:01.119
What would I do with
a wrinkled old guy like him?

59:07.492 --> 59:12.164
Our agreement was for you
to take a place by our side.

59:25.077 --> 59:27.313
And there you are.

59:29.014 --> 59:30.914
Now let's try some of that

59:30.916 --> 59:34.954
bitter old blood
that Juliet loves so much.

59:40.925 --> 59:42.728
Bring her.

59:59.244 --> 01:00:02.546
So this is the girl
that melted the heart of ice.

01:00:02.548 --> 01:00:04.948
And this is the deadbeat dad
who likes little children.

01:00:06.918 --> 01:00:10.120
She's got your loving
personality too, huh?

01:00:10.122 --> 01:00:14.524
Let's be clear,
I don't love you.

01:00:14.526 --> 01:00:17.260
In fact,
I don't even like you.

01:00:17.262 --> 01:00:22.064
But you carry my bloodline,

01:00:22.066 --> 01:00:28.070
and it's purer than any of these
impotent half-breeds.

01:00:28.072 --> 01:00:30.606
That's what makes
you special.

01:00:30.608 --> 01:00:32.008
I'm honored.

01:00:32.010 --> 01:00:33.609
Well, you should be!

01:00:33.611 --> 01:00:36.481
And if you were,
none of this would be happening!

01:00:43.287 --> 01:00:46.990
In addition to that ring
you're wearing on your finger,

01:00:46.992 --> 01:00:49.495
I got another souvenir.

01:00:53.865 --> 01:00:57.969
I remember ripping it from
your tender young breast.

01:01:00.572 --> 01:01:03.907
It would be a shame
if it were to find another.

01:01:10.481 --> 01:01:15.320
Finally, we see eye to eye.

01:01:36.108 --> 01:01:38.642
You said you would
never turn him,

01:01:38.644 --> 01:01:42.113
so I guess that leaves us
with only one option.

01:02:03.334 --> 01:02:05.568
I have no reason to kill her.

01:02:05.570 --> 01:02:07.606
Her life's but
a blink of an eye for me.

01:02:09.073 --> 01:02:11.041
When the transformation starts,

01:02:11.043 --> 01:02:13.609
your love for her
is going to fade so quickly

01:02:13.611 --> 01:02:16.379
without me even
lifting a finger,

01:02:16.381 --> 01:02:18.351
and that's
far more satisfying.

01:02:27.092 --> 01:02:29.361
It's okay, <i>agapi mou.</i>

01:02:44.642 --> 01:02:46.211
No!

01:02:53.117 --> 01:02:56.054
Too slow, my little angel.

01:03:02.059 --> 01:03:05.197
How do you keep getting people
to kill themselves for you?

01:03:06.631 --> 01:03:08.731
And how many more have to die?

01:03:10.501 --> 01:03:15.204
She was willing to
give her life for you.

01:03:15.206 --> 01:03:18.977
Are you willing
to give me yours?

01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:54.744
Not even a tear for
your friend of 30 years?

01:03:54.746 --> 01:03:58.316
I see the transformation
has already begun.

01:03:59.684 --> 01:04:01.519
Let her go!

01:04:07.793 --> 01:04:09.459
Of course,

01:04:09.461 --> 01:04:11.361
but permit me this
one last moment

01:04:11.363 --> 01:04:14.767
to see pain and misery
on my dear cousin's face.

01:04:17.535 --> 01:04:20.102
No!

01:04:39.090 --> 01:04:41.092
What's happening?

01:04:58.242 --> 01:05:00.242
A dying girl?

01:05:02.347 --> 01:05:05.450
You were in love
with a dying girl?

01:05:07.285 --> 01:05:10.156
You were in love
with a dying girl!

01:05:28.273 --> 01:05:30.773
Come on, let's get you
out of here.

01:05:32.276 --> 01:05:34.713
You're not going anywhere.

01:05:39.517 --> 01:05:43.385
You spent the last 800 years
trying to make me less human,

01:05:43.387 --> 01:05:46.555
when that was the only thing
keeping you alive.

01:05:46.557 --> 01:05:48.524
As my blood turns,

01:05:48.526 --> 01:05:53.296
I care less and less
whether you live or die.

01:05:53.298 --> 01:05:55.465
To me, you're already dead...

01:05:55.467 --> 01:06:01.106
a withering, impotent man
who I can crush like an ant.

01:06:02.606 --> 01:06:06.309
Your rein is over,
and everyone knows it.

01:06:06.311 --> 01:06:09.312
Now if you
or any of them follow me,

01:06:09.314 --> 01:06:11.513
I swear you'll get your wish

01:06:11.515 --> 01:06:15.753
and know just how
dangerous I can truly be.

01:06:40.544 --> 01:06:42.445
Follow her, you fools!

01:06:42.447 --> 01:06:46.684
- Kill her if we have to!
- Kill her...

01:08:12.436 --> 01:08:14.803
I hate your family.

01:08:18.042 --> 01:08:21.475
I can still make you laugh.

01:08:21.478 --> 01:08:24.814
That's cause you say
the dumbest things ever.

01:08:29.888 --> 01:08:32.725
It's beautiful, isn't it?

01:08:34.459 --> 01:08:38.429
The sun's so yellow
it's almost white.

01:08:49.006 --> 01:08:52.041
I love you.
I love you, Juliet, I love you.

01:08:52.042 --> 01:08:54.446
I love you too.
