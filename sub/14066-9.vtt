00:01.001 --> 00:02.252
NARRATOR: <i>Previously on</i> Boston Legal...

00:02.335 --> 00:06.089
The reason I came to the Boston office
was to wring out some of the madness.

00:06.172 --> 00:07.799
Some Pakistani put a hit on her?

00:07.882 --> 00:10.301
I fled London, changed my name,
began a new life here.

00:10.385 --> 00:13.054
What if your ex-Pakistani blows up
the building? Hmm?

00:13.138 --> 00:14.305
JUDGE: What are you doing?

00:14.389 --> 00:16.057
Climbing on my soapbox, Judge.
I do it once a week.

00:16.141 --> 00:18.143
-This is not your political forum.
-Really?

00:18.226 --> 00:20.812
-What kind of lawyer are you?
-The troubled-yet-fun kind.

00:20.895 --> 00:25.358
You're representing a woman
who's in love with a utility box.

00:25.442 --> 00:28.278
You likened your buttocks to God's image.

00:28.361 --> 00:30.947
You cannot fire somebody
just because they're fat!

00:41.958 --> 00:44.377
Oh, will you stop with the dink shots?
You're playing like a girl.

00:44.461 --> 00:45.795
Just get up to the net.

00:47.130 --> 00:49.257
-Hey, hey, that was out.
-What, are you a linesman now?

00:50.592 --> 00:51.718
Cheat. (grunts)

00:52.510 --> 00:54.596
ALAN (grunts, chuckles): Oh, God.

00:55.513 --> 00:57.599
Game, set, match. Jump the net.

00:57.682 --> 00:59.601
-(knocking on door)
-Mr. Crane?

00:59.684 --> 01:01.978
Oh, Bert, my man.
What brings you downtown?

01:02.062 --> 01:04.689
You do. You sued me, Mr. Crane.

01:05.273 --> 01:06.441
Oh, right.

01:06.524 --> 01:07.484
Why'd you sue me?

01:08.068 --> 01:10.737
Uh, well, Bert,
because I drove all the way

01:10.820 --> 01:12.030
to Revere Beach
to get one of your pizzas--

01:12.113 --> 01:13.406
He makes the best pizza in the world.

01:13.490 --> 01:16.367
And when I got to Revere Beach
after an hour in traffic,

01:16.451 --> 01:17.660
I didn't get my pizza.

01:17.744 --> 01:19.829
You weren't there. You were closed.
That pissed me off.

01:19.913 --> 01:22.290
Did you see the restaurant?
It was destroyed.

01:22.373 --> 01:24.375
It got trashed in the flood.
It wasn't my fault.

01:24.459 --> 01:27.253
So what? You sue who hurts you.
I sue who hurts me.

01:27.337 --> 01:29.339
That's the way the law works.

01:29.422 --> 01:31.257
What do I sue? God for causing the flood?

01:31.341 --> 01:33.593
Or the National Guard
for failing to show up and help?

01:33.676 --> 01:36.179
That's your call, Bert. I'm rested.
Another game?

01:36.262 --> 01:38.348
This isn't fair. And it's not funny.

01:39.057 --> 01:40.391
I lost my business, Mr. Crane.

01:40.475 --> 01:42.936
Everything I worked for my entire life,
it's all gone.

01:44.229 --> 01:45.814
My place got destroyed by a flood.

01:45.897 --> 01:48.066
It could've been prevented,
and nobody came.

01:48.691 --> 01:49.734
I'm afraid Denny's right.

01:49.818 --> 01:51.653
Though I wouldn't sue God.
He's a flight risk.

01:52.278 --> 01:55.907
So that would leave the National Guard.
We'll represent you.

01:56.741 --> 01:57.742
-What?
-What?

01:57.826 --> 01:59.661
The National Guard has a duty to show up

01:59.744 --> 02:01.246
should there be a natural disaster.
They didn't.

02:01.329 --> 02:02.789
And like any real tragedy,

02:02.872 --> 02:05.041
somebody somewhere
has to stand ready to exploit it.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.167
That's where Denny and I come in.

02:06.251 --> 02:09.420
One of my specialties is turning
courtroom proceedings into a circus.

02:09.504 --> 02:11.756
-You'll need to wear a tie.
-What are you talking about?

02:11.840 --> 02:14.008
I'm talking about suing
the National Guard, of course.

02:17.011 --> 02:19.597
Suing the National Guard. I like it.

02:19.681 --> 02:23.101
(theme music playing)

02:25.228 --> 02:26.563
<i>♪ Uh-huh ♪</i>

02:29.482 --> 02:30.733

02:51.171 --> 02:54.257
-Alan, I'm having second thoughts.
-Why?

02:54.340 --> 02:55.466
Suing the National Guard,

02:55.550 --> 02:59.762
it might seem unpatriotic
to criticize one's country

02:59.846 --> 03:03.850
at a time when we're trying to blow up
somebody else's country.

03:03.933 --> 03:06.561
Come on, Denny.
You'll actually be serving America here.

03:06.644 --> 03:08.313
Sorry we're late. New case.

03:08.396 --> 03:11.524
What? The two of you serving America
makes me nervous.

03:11.608 --> 03:14.819
Oh. We've decided to sue
the National Guard, Carl. You want in?

03:15.820 --> 03:16.946
You're suing them for what?

03:17.405 --> 03:19.157
They failed to protect
Denny's favorite pizza parlor

03:19.240 --> 03:20.700
from being wiped out by a flood.

03:23.286 --> 03:24.913
Yes or no? I can't save your spot.

03:24.996 --> 03:27.373
Alan, you cannot sue the National Guard.

03:27.457 --> 03:29.209
Of course we can. Isn't it grand, Shirley?

03:29.292 --> 03:31.961
We do these things
that seem completely absurd,

03:32.045 --> 03:34.589
and then, incredibly, we manage
to make them not only watchable,

03:34.672 --> 03:36.090
but fun and informative

03:36.424 --> 03:38.218
Aren't you just dying to see
how we do it this time?

03:38.301 --> 03:39.135
I'm not.

03:39.928 --> 03:41.804
Just the thought of dying makes me jumpy.

03:41.888 --> 03:44.015
I don't like dying.
That's why I live my life safe.

03:44.098 --> 03:46.392
And I don't like to put others
at risk either.

03:46.476 --> 03:50.188
Not everybody's like that.
That's just me, I guess.

03:52.649 --> 03:55.193
Thank you for that stirring
commentary, Whitney.

03:55.526 --> 03:59.530
-WOMAN: Grammy?
-Marlena?

04:00.114 --> 04:04.369
I'm so sorry to interrupt.
Oh, my God. It's an emergency.

04:04.452 --> 04:07.580
I am in big trouble, Grammy.
I need your help.

04:08.039 --> 04:08.873
Okay.

04:16.381 --> 04:17.382
Grammy!

04:17.674 --> 04:20.176
Okay. Is it me,
or is that little thing hot?

04:22.553 --> 04:23.721
Hope I'm not her grandpa.

04:33.564 --> 04:35.775
-Expelled?
-(sighs) My parents don't know.

04:35.858 --> 04:36.901
They'll kill me.

04:37.193 --> 04:40.363
Grammy, you gotta help me.
I can't be expelled. My life will be over.

04:40.446 --> 04:41.614
Oh, my God.

04:41.698 --> 04:44.075
-(door closes)
-What did you do?

04:45.034 --> 04:46.244
It was bad.

04:48.162 --> 04:48.997
I was--

04:50.415 --> 04:52.709
Well, you know those stupid
government-issued assessment tests

04:52.792 --> 04:53.876
they always make you take?

04:54.752 --> 04:58.047
I sort of stole the test
and accidentally shredded it

04:58.131 --> 05:03.094
and inadvertently scattered the confetti
all over the principal's office, sort of.

05:04.429 --> 05:08.349
Okay, so maybe it wasn't an accident.
But I can't be expelled. Oh, my God.

05:08.891 --> 05:11.227
Marlena, what were you thinking?

05:11.394 --> 05:13.896
Well, something like...

05:14.939 --> 05:17.358
Well, you know
how those standardized tests are evil.

05:17.442 --> 05:20.820
And something like how
if Henry David Thoreau were still alive,

05:20.903 --> 05:21.863
he'd shred them, too.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.450
Something like that, sort of.

05:28.077 --> 05:29.787
KATIE: Just a bit curious, that's all.

05:30.580 --> 05:31.956
What's to be curious about?

05:32.832 --> 05:37.003
Well, I have many Pakistani friends,
none of whom believe in honor killings.

05:37.086 --> 05:38.880
And as for anyone who does,

05:38.963 --> 05:40.798
I'm having trouble seeing you
and he as soul mates.

05:41.591 --> 05:45.011
It turns out we were not soul mates,
which occasioned my having the affair.

05:45.094 --> 05:47.764
-Does it really matter?
-Uh, it does to me.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.475
And I can't figure out
why you would sign on

05:50.558 --> 05:53.436
for high-profile cases,
of which you've had many,

05:53.519 --> 05:55.563
with your little face all on the news.

05:55.855 --> 05:58.983
Just seems odd for somebody
who's got a fatwa against her.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.277
I mean, I tend to lay low with my fatwas.

06:03.696 --> 06:06.115
Three associates grouped.
Who's getting billed?

06:06.199 --> 06:08.576
Oh, get over yourself, Carl.
You want something?

06:08.785 --> 06:10.995
Yes, Whitney.
Shirley needs a second chair.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.247
Oh, thank you so much for volunteering.

06:13.331 --> 06:16.417
-I didn't.
-Ah, but you did.

06:17.168 --> 06:18.878
-They're waiting for you.
-Great.

06:22.173 --> 06:23.841
Do I need to find something for you to do?

06:28.554 --> 06:29.472
I don't scare.

06:33.768 --> 06:36.854
Of all the ridiculous, outrageous,
preposterous cases

06:36.938 --> 06:39.649
you've brought before me,
this one takes the prize!

06:39.732 --> 06:42.110
Well, thank you, Your Honor.
We love prizes.

06:42.193 --> 06:44.737
And it should be said,
when we get the ridiculous, outrageous,

06:44.821 --> 06:46.781
preposterous cases,
we immediately think of you.

06:46.864 --> 06:48.324
Though I must say,

06:48.408 --> 06:50.701
the most ridiculous part of this case is,
it's actually not.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.328
What's your course of action?

06:52.745 --> 06:55.665
Well, Your Honor,
my client had an expectation of services

06:55.748 --> 06:58.126
from the National Guard,
services which they did not provide.

06:58.209 --> 07:00.086
We're in a war, for God's sake!

07:00.169 --> 07:03.131
And if the war or anything else
rendered them incapable

07:03.214 --> 07:05.925
of providing services at home,
how about a little notice?

07:06.008 --> 07:09.011
Tell the people they're on their own.
My client could've taken precautions.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.930
He might've purchased flood insurance.

07:11.013 --> 07:14.308
As it was, to his detriment,
he relied on the idea

07:14.392 --> 07:15.977
that the National Guard
would be there for him.

07:16.060 --> 07:18.604
They weren't.
He lost his business, his life's work.

07:18.688 --> 07:22.358
Mr. Shore, you have brought
many un-American cases into my courtroom.

07:22.775 --> 07:25.570
-But this-this is--
-Outrageous, yes.

07:25.653 --> 07:28.364
So is the fact that when my client
needed the National Guard,

07:28.448 --> 07:29.949
they were nowhere to be found.

07:30.908 --> 07:33.161
I take that back.
They could be found in Iraq.

07:33.244 --> 07:34.996
-You listen to me.
-With both ears.

07:35.079 --> 07:36.789
This court will reconvene at two o'clock.

07:36.873 --> 07:39.834
I will listen to your proffer
of exactly what your case is.

07:39.917 --> 07:42.295
If it's as baseless as I expect it to be--

07:42.378 --> 07:43.963
As you keep an open mind.

07:44.046 --> 07:47.133
I will jail both you
and Mr. Crane for contempt.

07:48.342 --> 07:49.844
Me? What did I do?

07:53.097 --> 07:55.850
These are serious, serious charges here.

07:56.142 --> 07:59.812
Stealing tests, vandalism,
destruction of school property.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.940
I could report her
to the district attorney.

08:04.192 --> 08:08.279
I understand, and we're all very grateful
that you haven't.

08:08.946 --> 08:11.199
I was also hoping that your understanding

08:11.282 --> 08:16.329
might extend to a reconsideration
of Marlena's expulsion.

08:16.412 --> 08:18.956
But just in case,
she came armed with attorneys.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.584
My granddaughter is very contrite.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.212
MAN: What I don't understand,

08:24.295 --> 08:27.089
she's always been a model student,
well-behaved.

08:27.173 --> 08:30.134
She spends one year abroad
and she comes back a monster.

08:30.843 --> 08:31.928
What happened, Marlena?

08:32.678 --> 08:34.514
Well, when I was studying in England,

08:34.597 --> 08:38.017
I just realized how pathetic
this school is.

08:40.019 --> 08:40.853
Sort of.

08:41.270 --> 08:45.233
And how you don't really teach us
anything, and that made me angry.

08:45.316 --> 08:49.362
Add to that, how stupid the idea
of these standardized tests are, and...

08:50.446 --> 08:54.158
well, I wanted to shred you. (chuckles)

08:54.242 --> 08:56.244
But I realized
that would be taking it too far,

08:56.327 --> 09:01.040
so I settled for the tests, sort of.

09:02.917 --> 09:05.920
Her contrition aside,
the expulsion stands.

09:06.003 --> 09:08.839
Excuse me.
Can I be the voice of reason here?

09:09.549 --> 09:12.385
Miss Schmidt may be a little too close.
It's her granddaughter.

09:12.468 --> 09:15.221
And you, being the one
who feels insulted...

09:15.930 --> 09:19.934
-May I just make a neutral observation?
-Okay.

09:21.018 --> 09:24.564
If we have to go to court, we will,
and we'll embarrass your sorry ass.

09:24.647 --> 09:27.900
My advice would be
to take this girl back now

09:27.984 --> 09:29.610
so that we don't have to sue you

09:29.694 --> 09:35.575
and put the whole public school system
on trial for raising a nation of idiots.

09:36.784 --> 09:37.618
Is that helpful?

09:40.204 --> 09:41.163
(elevator bell dings)

09:41.789 --> 09:43.916
Fine. Make me the bad guy.

09:44.750 --> 09:47.503
-I tried to help.
-Yeah, by antagonizing him.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.089
I did not antagonize. I threatened, okay?

09:50.172 --> 09:51.132
Everyone has a style.

09:51.215 --> 09:54.176
Yeah. Well, yours isn't working.
She's facing expulsion.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.762
-Why is she in public school anyway?
-Oh, shut up.

09:56.846 --> 09:59.682
-Sounds like it went well.
-Yeah! Ask Grammy.

10:02.143 --> 10:06.230
Shirley, um, this obviously sounds
like a bad time, but...

10:06.856 --> 10:08.232
But what?

10:08.774 --> 10:11.319
(exhales) I'm considering
going back to New York.

10:20.620 --> 10:21.495
I, uh...

10:22.788 --> 10:25.166
I don't understand.
Is it-- Is it something about me?

10:26.000 --> 10:28.461
No. I love you.

10:29.962 --> 10:31.088
Then...

10:31.797 --> 10:34.300
I'm not doing anything here.

10:35.676 --> 10:38.387
You brought me in
to restore a little order

10:38.471 --> 10:40.473
in the litigation department.

10:41.015 --> 10:44.518
Well, I'm failing, Shirley.
Rather miserably, in fact.

10:45.394 --> 10:46.562
In my very short tenure,

10:46.646 --> 10:51.942
we've represented clients
for cockfighting, bullfighting,

10:52.026 --> 10:55.363
solicitation of a female prostitute,
that being a senior partner,

10:55.571 --> 10:58.491
solicitation of a male prostitute,
the same senior partner,

10:58.574 --> 11:02.745
who we also defended in a civil suit
after he fired a fat girl

11:02.828 --> 11:05.915
because he didn't want to catch obesity.

11:05.998 --> 11:10.753
We routinely bring
the most ridiculous of lawsuits.

11:10.836 --> 11:13.464
Today, we have one
against the National Guard. This is nuts.

11:14.131 --> 11:15.883
And what's the problem?

11:17.176 --> 11:20.096
I don't know how to manage this.

11:20.179 --> 11:24.517
What's more,
I don't really think you want it managed.

11:24.850 --> 11:28.396
I think you like this,
this whatever it is.

11:30.398 --> 11:34.819
Can't you just, sort of, seize the day?

11:37.071 --> 11:38.322
If I can't feel...

11:40.074 --> 11:44.328
like I'm bringing anything to,
what seems to be very much a party,

11:45.079 --> 11:46.831
I'll never be happy.

11:49.166 --> 11:50.459
You bring a lot to me.

11:54.547 --> 11:55.381
It's not enough.

12:00.261 --> 12:01.095
Well, I...

12:02.555 --> 12:04.557
I guess that says it all, doesn't it?

12:17.903 --> 12:18.821
Let me get this straight.

12:19.655 --> 12:23.576
You want me to enjoin
a high school expulsion?

12:23.993 --> 12:24.869
Yes, Your Honor,

12:24.952 --> 12:27.955
on the grounds that a harmless act
of civil disobedience

12:28.038 --> 12:29.290
shouldn't warrant expulsion.

12:29.373 --> 12:31.083
Certainly not in this case.

12:31.167 --> 12:35.421
Uh-huh. And suppose every kid
wanted to hijack and shred tests,

12:35.504 --> 12:37.465
then scatter them
over the principal's office?

12:37.548 --> 12:39.925
Well, I suspect most kids
wouldn't dare do that

12:40.009 --> 12:42.219
for fear of jeopardizing
their college careers.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.847
In fact, most kids are so desperate
to get into college,

12:44.930 --> 12:47.808
they're willing to completely forsake
learning just to get there.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.437
Miss Hoffman, take the stand, please.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.245
(keyboard keys clacking)

13:13.459 --> 13:16.212
(clears throat)
Is this how it's going to be, Katie?

13:18.130 --> 13:20.466
I have to look over one shoulder
for an ex-husband,

13:20.549 --> 13:21.967
the other to see what you're up to?

13:22.051 --> 13:23.594
Oh, I was just daydreaming, that's all.

13:23.677 --> 13:25.471
Daydreaming? About what?

13:25.554 --> 13:28.641
Well, my wedding day,
if you must know. Girls do that.

13:28.724 --> 13:31.602
What kind of ceremony,
the dress, that sort of thing.

13:31.685 --> 13:32.812
What was your dress like, Lorraine?

13:33.646 --> 13:35.981
-Lot of lace.
-What color was it?

13:37.358 --> 13:40.611
I only ask because Pakistani tradition
would be a red dress,

13:40.694 --> 13:42.822
and since your husband
is orthodox enough to believe in fatwas...

13:44.198 --> 13:45.533
Did you wear red, Lorraine?

13:51.956 --> 13:53.582
MALE ANNOUNCER ON TV:
<i>As water continued to pour in,</i>

13:53.666 --> 13:56.043
<i>27 fire departments from seven counties</i>

13:56.126 --> 13:59.255
<i>worked throughout the night</i>
<i>with sandbags, all to no avail,</i>

13:59.338 --> 14:01.423
<i>as more than 33,000 people were displaced</i>

14:01.507 --> 14:03.926
<i>from either their homes or businesses,</i>

14:04.009 --> 14:07.012
<i>all of them angry,</i>
<i>all singing the same refrain,</i>

14:07.096 --> 14:08.472
<i>where was the National Guard?</i>

14:09.849 --> 14:12.268
We all know where they were.
In Iraq, fighting a war.

14:12.351 --> 14:15.062
And in times of war,
you make sacrifices, Mr. Shore.

14:15.145 --> 14:16.814
Yes, but this military branch

14:16.897 --> 14:19.275
has domestic responsibilities
as well, Judge.

14:19.358 --> 14:21.443
The governor declared
a state of emergency,

14:21.527 --> 14:22.695
and they were gone.

14:22.778 --> 14:25.072
And it isn't just the troops
that are in Iraq, by the way,

14:25.155 --> 14:27.324
but much of the National Guard's
equipment as well.

14:27.408 --> 14:28.868
And what most people don't know,

14:28.951 --> 14:30.786
we just leave it there,
we don't bring it back.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.913
-We're in a state of--
-War. Yes.

14:32.997 --> 14:36.000
We're in a post-mission accomplished surge

14:36.083 --> 14:38.335
that General Petraeus
says is going very well,

14:38.419 --> 14:41.672
and that our president has assured us all
the next president,

14:41.755 --> 14:44.550
good luck to him or her,
might even figure a way out of.

14:44.633 --> 14:48.095
All you do is bitch.
This time, you've gone too far.

14:48.178 --> 14:51.015
You are just one minute away
from a jail cell, Mr. Shore.

14:51.098 --> 14:55.519
Uh, Your Honor, my point,
we're not getting services at home.

14:55.603 --> 14:57.646
The people in New Orleans
didn't after Katrina.

14:57.730 --> 14:58.731
My client didn't here.

14:58.814 --> 15:01.358
And by the way, I don't think
I'm that much of a complainer,

15:01.442 --> 15:02.943
given all there is to complain about.

15:03.027 --> 15:06.030
Education, Social Security,
inflation, unemployment,

15:06.113 --> 15:08.616
health care, Homeland Security, the war,

15:08.699 --> 15:11.243
the fact that Osama and Britney
keep pumping out new videos.

15:11.327 --> 15:14.079
There's global warming.
Nothing, nothing is going right, Judge!

15:14.163 --> 15:16.373
And you simply cannot put
a positive spin on it,

15:16.457 --> 15:18.834
no matter how many times you say
"General Petraeus!"

15:18.918 --> 15:20.836
Thirty seconds from a jail cell.

15:20.920 --> 15:25.549
This war has cost us 450 billion dollars
and still counting.

15:25.633 --> 15:29.053
Add to that, the Afghanistan invasion,
it goes up to 650 billion.

15:29.136 --> 15:31.096
Add all the indirect costs,
it goes up to two trillion.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.306
Twenty seconds!

15:32.389 --> 15:37.561
Let's just consider what the 450 billion
dollars we spent in Iraq could buy us.

15:37.645 --> 15:41.190
How about free health insurance
for every uninsured family?

15:41.273 --> 15:42.566
One hundred twenty-four billion.

15:42.650 --> 15:47.571
Convert every single car
to run on ethanol, 68 billion.

15:47.655 --> 15:52.618
Primary education for every child
on the planet, all of them, 30 billion.

15:52.701 --> 15:55.329
Hey, end hunger in America, seven billion.

15:55.412 --> 15:56.956
You are not an accountant!

15:57.039 --> 15:58.332
No. I'm a town crier, Judge.

15:58.415 --> 16:01.585
We have to talk about the cost of this war
in terms of human lives.

16:01.669 --> 16:02.628
It's in the thousands!

16:02.711 --> 16:04.713
And by that, I mean American soldiers,

16:04.797 --> 16:06.632
since the Pentagon
doesn't seem to count Iraqis.

16:06.715 --> 16:09.760
But that's a small point.
The actual cost is much, much more!

16:09.843 --> 16:11.011
Suing our government,

16:11.095 --> 16:13.973
suing a branch of the--
of the military in a time of war

16:14.056 --> 16:15.557
cannot help but add to it.

16:15.641 --> 16:18.310
No, your case against
the National Guard is dismissed.

16:18.394 --> 16:21.146
The bailiff will take Mr. Shore
and Mr. Crane into custody

16:21.230 --> 16:24.233
and lock them up
for contempt of court and country!

16:28.904 --> 16:31.448
I've got my own. Those pinch.

16:34.743 --> 16:37.162
In England,
in school with the British kids,

16:37.246 --> 16:40.499
I looked like a complete ignoramus.

16:40.582 --> 16:44.670
Oh, my God. They knew more
about everything than I did.

16:44.753 --> 16:46.755
They knew my country's history better,

16:46.839 --> 16:49.550
they could find places on the map
that I couldn't.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.927
And you blame your high school
back home for this?

16:52.011 --> 16:55.472
Well, I came back here
and I started to do a little research.

16:56.015 --> 16:59.643
Did you know there's a study that found
one-third of young adults in the US

16:59.727 --> 17:01.687
can't tell you which way northwest is?

17:01.770 --> 17:03.814
Okay, but let's be fair. You can.

17:04.106 --> 17:05.983
Well, that's not much of a consolation.

17:06.066 --> 17:09.737
Less than 40 percent of high school
seniors can read proficiently.

17:09.820 --> 17:11.155
That's pathetic.

17:11.238 --> 17:13.490
And these standardized tests, oh, my God!

17:13.574 --> 17:15.534
So you decided to shred them?

17:16.744 --> 17:19.496
Eldridge Cleaver said,
"You're either part of the solution

17:19.580 --> 17:20.873
or part of the problem."

17:21.665 --> 17:23.709
I learned that in England, by the way.

17:25.419 --> 17:26.712
You committed a crime.

17:27.129 --> 17:31.759
I took action to ensure my right
to be provided a quality education,

17:31.842 --> 17:34.511
as promised by the Massachusetts
State Constitution

17:34.595 --> 17:37.473
and the Education Reform Act of 1993.

17:37.765 --> 17:40.476
Oh. Did they tell you
to say that in England?

17:40.559 --> 17:42.478
No, they said claim executive privilege.

17:43.187 --> 17:46.940
MAN: The tests you shredded, young lady,
are specifically designed in part,

17:47.024 --> 17:49.526
to identify which schools need
which improvements in which areas.

17:49.610 --> 17:52.029
-The very goal--
-Judge, the data on these tests

17:52.112 --> 17:53.822
is so fudged.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.033
In Mississippi, for example,

17:56.116 --> 17:58.786
the national test showed
that only 18 percent of kids

17:58.869 --> 17:59.745
could read proficiently.

17:59.828 --> 18:01.121
So what did they do?

18:01.205 --> 18:05.084
They made a special Mississippi test
that showed 89 percent were proficient.

18:05.167 --> 18:09.254
And presto, they avoid sanctions
from No Child Left Behind.

18:09.671 --> 18:11.882
So, the answer is shredding the test?

18:12.216 --> 18:15.260
If the choice comes down
to teach the test or shred it,

18:16.136 --> 18:18.180
I vote shred it. Oh, my God!

18:25.312 --> 18:28.273
-Why is nobody coming for us?
-(sighs)

18:28.357 --> 18:29.900
Where are our significant others?

18:29.983 --> 18:33.362
-Denny, we're our significant others.
-Oh, yeah.

18:33.445 --> 18:34.321
(alarm buzzes)

18:37.366 --> 18:40.160
I didn't like it when he said
that all I do is bitch.

18:40.244 --> 18:41.495
Well, you do complain a lot.

18:41.578 --> 18:44.123
But this wasn't trivial, Denny.
I mean, think of it.

18:44.206 --> 18:48.293
This country is utterly ill-equipped
to deal with national emergencies

18:48.377 --> 18:50.212
because we're too busy imposing
democracies elsewhere.

18:50.712 --> 18:54.216
In Katrina, a lot of experts
could see it coming with those levees.

18:54.716 --> 18:57.177
And we didn't do anything.
And when they broke, we couldn't respond.

18:57.261 --> 18:59.763
Just like we lacked the manpower
to respond to the flood here.

19:00.305 --> 19:01.932
Isn't there something wrong with that?

19:02.015 --> 19:04.143
The roof's leaking at home,
and we're re-shingling abroad.

19:04.893 --> 19:06.562
-(chittering)
-(alarm buzzes)

19:08.814 --> 19:11.358
-Oh, thank you, God.
-Lorraine?

19:11.441 --> 19:13.277
I don't want to be let out.
Just let her in.

19:13.902 --> 19:14.736
Please.

19:17.906 --> 19:18.824
Be sure to lock it.

19:20.033 --> 19:23.078
-I need to talk to you in private.
-Well, that could be difficult.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.414
Not at all. People talk like
I'm not in the room all the time.

19:25.497 --> 19:26.999
What I hear, I won't remember.

19:29.877 --> 19:31.128
It's about my past.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.006
My past?

19:35.132 --> 19:36.842
-Oh.
-You-you have a past?

19:36.925 --> 19:38.010
Denny, please.

19:39.970 --> 19:42.472
Katie. Whitney.

19:44.224 --> 19:45.350
The wagons are circling.

19:45.934 --> 19:48.562
Katie tumbled to the idea
that I was English, and now she's--

19:48.645 --> 19:50.022
You're English?

19:50.105 --> 19:52.065
Yes, Denny, I am.

19:52.149 --> 19:54.109
(in British accent)
I suspect you find that rather exotic.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.777
Oh, I love the English!

19:56.445 --> 19:59.615
I had a thing with the Queen once
on top of a Xerox machine.

20:00.365 --> 20:04.036
She's an animal.
Ever since then, I've carried this around.

20:08.582 --> 20:11.460
She is out-of-her-mind happy there.
Trust me.

20:17.174 --> 20:18.508
Lorraine, what's going on?

20:18.675 --> 20:22.512
I first told Katie I was married
to a Pakistani who put a fatwa on me.

20:22.596 --> 20:24.431
-Hence my need for secrecy.
-A fatwa?

20:24.514 --> 20:26.683
I was trying to throw her off.
She didn't buy it.

20:26.767 --> 20:28.268
What the hell is she talking about?

20:32.940 --> 20:36.777
Uh, Denny, when Lorraine
was in her early 20s, she ran a business.

20:37.361 --> 20:41.782
A service. She was known throughout
England as the Piccadilly Madame.

20:42.449 --> 20:43.450
My dream come true.

20:45.202 --> 20:46.954
-You're a hooker.
-No.

20:47.037 --> 20:49.748
She never performed services.
She just arranged for escorts.

20:50.958 --> 20:53.710
-And Katie knows?
-Not yet, but it's...

20:54.044 --> 20:55.963
I don't know what to do.
It's only a matter of time.

20:56.046 --> 20:58.257
She keeps saying I look familiar.
She's watching every--

20:58.340 --> 20:59.758
A hooker with a fatwa.

20:59.841 --> 21:03.303
Lorraine, you've always known
this would eventually surface.

21:03.387 --> 21:05.764
My advice would be to go forward
to Shirley Schmidt now.

21:05.847 --> 21:07.057
You be the one to tell her.

21:07.808 --> 21:08.725
And then what?

21:09.017 --> 21:11.645
(scoffs) I doubt very much
they'll have use for an associate

21:11.728 --> 21:13.272
who once ran a prostitution ring.

21:13.355 --> 21:16.900
-I would.
-One thing about Shirley, she surprises.

21:16.984 --> 21:18.735
My bet is this is something
you can live down.

21:18.819 --> 21:20.112
We've been bad, too.

21:21.863 --> 21:24.116
Do you have any of those nannies
that spank?

21:26.576 --> 21:28.453
You might not live it down today.

21:42.968 --> 21:43.802
(door opens)

21:45.887 --> 21:48.348
-Hey.
-Hey. Come in.

21:58.066 --> 22:01.653
I've been thinking a lot
about what you said.

22:02.696 --> 22:07.075
Carl, your coming here
to manage this place,

22:07.534 --> 22:12.247
while not a pretext, I think we both know

22:12.789 --> 22:16.460
you're mostly here
because we wanted to be together.

22:17.461 --> 22:19.171
Has that changed on your side?

22:20.422 --> 22:21.256
No.

22:23.050 --> 22:24.801
But, Shirley, I can't deny,

22:24.885 --> 22:31.683
my esteem is somewhat bound up
in my feeling of worth at my job.

22:31.767 --> 22:32.934
I'm not feeling...

22:34.102 --> 22:36.188
The things that go on here are just...

22:37.856 --> 22:38.774
Carl, come on.

22:39.232 --> 22:41.485
Strip away the eccentricities,
and at its core,

22:41.568 --> 22:43.904
this is just like any other firm.

22:45.530 --> 22:46.907
(in British accent)
I do apologize for intruding.

22:47.491 --> 22:50.535
Alan and Denny have been incarcerated
on contempt charges.

22:50.619 --> 22:54.247
They wanted me to convey as much.
They are being held indefinitely.

22:54.664 --> 22:56.500
Why are you speaking in that accent?

22:57.376 --> 22:58.794
Because I'm from England, Shirley.

22:59.753 --> 23:03.048
I owned and operated a brothel
during my late teens and early 20s.

23:03.757 --> 23:06.009
After being arrested,
I reached a deal with the authorities

23:06.093 --> 23:09.096
whereby I would not be prosecuted
if I agreed to disappear.

23:09.638 --> 23:12.099
My clients included a member
of the Royal Family,

23:12.265 --> 23:15.185
as well as several high-ranking members
of Parliament,

23:15.268 --> 23:17.229
so no extradition is being sought.

23:17.312 --> 23:19.481
I assumed a new identity,
moved to America,

23:19.564 --> 23:22.317
and attended law school
as Lorraine Weller,

23:22.401 --> 23:23.777
which is now my legal name.

23:27.239 --> 23:29.533
I tell you all of this
in the spirit of no surprises.

23:30.742 --> 23:32.994
This is in the spirit of no surprises?

23:33.954 --> 23:35.789
Yeah, you know, I'm sorry.
You were right, Shirley.

23:37.082 --> 23:38.250
Just like any other firm.

23:49.302 --> 23:52.431
<i>People out there in our nation</i>
<i>don't have maps,</i>

23:52.514 --> 23:57.185
<i>and, uh, I believe that our education,</i>
<i>like, such as in South Africa,</i>

23:57.269 --> 24:00.147
<i>and, uh, the Iraq, everywhere,</i>
<i>like, such as--</i>

24:00.230 --> 24:03.692
<i>And I believe that they should, uh--</i>

24:03.775 --> 24:07.195
<i>Our education over here in the US</i>
<i>should help the US</i>

24:07.279 --> 24:09.656
<i>or should help South Africa,</i>

24:09.739 --> 24:11.116
<i>and should help the Iraq</i>

24:11.199 --> 24:13.243
<i>-and the Asian countries--</i>
-(bell dings)

24:13.785 --> 24:17.330
In that young woman's defense,
she's actually quite intelligent.

24:17.414 --> 24:20.542
She was just thrown by the question
and got nervous.

24:21.293 --> 24:23.170
Yeah, I was thrown by the question, too.

24:23.253 --> 24:26.965
A fifth of Americans can't find
the United States on the map?

24:27.048 --> 24:28.091
Is that true?

24:28.175 --> 24:31.344
Objection. This witness works
at the National Geographic. She--

24:31.428 --> 24:34.097
The National Geographic
has done two studies to determine

24:34.181 --> 24:35.974
the geographic literacy
of young Americans.

24:36.057 --> 24:37.601
-Isn't that right?
-Yes.

24:37.684 --> 24:39.352
Could you give us the results, please?

24:40.103 --> 24:41.104
I sobbed.

24:41.646 --> 24:45.400
Big, heaving sobs
where your shoulders go up and down.

24:45.484 --> 24:48.445
Uh, the results of the test,
not your reaction to it.

24:49.446 --> 24:52.991
Half couldn't locate New York State
on a US map.

24:53.700 --> 24:56.953
Even after Katrina,
one-third couldn't show you Louisiana.

24:57.037 --> 25:00.040
The Pacific Ocean,
goose egg from 29 percent.

25:00.332 --> 25:02.459
The Pacific Ocean, for God sakes!

25:02.542 --> 25:05.003
And where's Japan?
Fifty-eight percent don't know.

25:05.295 --> 25:07.964
England? Head scratcher for 69 percent.

25:08.048 --> 25:11.885
Did you survey the geographic literacy
of young adults in other countries?

25:12.052 --> 25:17.390
Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, Mexico, Sweden, England.

25:17.474 --> 25:18.934
How'd we do comparatively?

25:20.435 --> 25:23.188
Second to last. We beat Mexico.

25:25.065 --> 25:28.193
-(voice breaking) May I be excused?
-No, get a grip.

25:29.236 --> 25:31.571
Were any of the young Americans
surveyed products

25:31.655 --> 25:33.532
of a Massachusetts public school?

25:33.615 --> 25:36.117
(sniffling) No.

25:46.044 --> 25:48.338
I've been thinking about how much
I criticize the government.

25:49.381 --> 25:51.007
Yet what do I do for the government?

25:51.091 --> 25:52.968
DENNY: Oh, Alan, you're a Democrat.

25:53.051 --> 25:55.345
You're expected to complain
and offer no solutions.

25:58.223 --> 25:59.724
I'm gonna join the National Guard.

25:59.808 --> 26:01.935
-Very funny.
-ALAN: I'm serious.

26:02.018 --> 26:03.228
I won't contribute to the war effort,

26:03.311 --> 26:04.729
but there's gotta be something else
I can do.

26:04.813 --> 26:06.565
-Like what?
-I don't know.

26:07.399 --> 26:10.443
Maybe help prevent somebody's pizza parlor
from being washed away.

26:10.527 --> 26:11.653
(lock clicking)

26:19.452 --> 26:21.788
I'm letting you go for one consideration.

26:22.998 --> 26:25.875
That I never see you again.

26:25.959 --> 26:27.127
Ever.

26:27.627 --> 26:30.463
We've decided to join the National Guard.
Are you in?

26:34.676 --> 26:35.969
Come on, Denny.

26:37.345 --> 26:39.222
Ask not what your country can do for you.

26:40.307 --> 26:43.018
-Think they'll let me shoot somebody?
-I don't see why not.

26:50.859 --> 26:53.695
I'm sorry,
but I'm afraid neither of you can join.

26:54.195 --> 26:56.531
-Why not?
-Well, the maximum age is 42.

26:56.615 --> 26:59.784
I'm very sorry, but thank you
for thinking of your country.

26:59.868 --> 27:02.746
-Forty-two? Why?
-Well, that's just the way it is, sir.

27:02.829 --> 27:04.497
But thank you
for thinking of your country.

27:04.581 --> 27:06.958
That's just the way it is?
That should be the way it isn't.

27:07.042 --> 27:09.669
We both have skills.
We have a lot to offer.

27:09.753 --> 27:11.504
I'm sorry, sir, but thank you--

27:11.588 --> 27:13.340
Never mind that the army is depleted,
for God's sake.

27:13.423 --> 27:14.883
You're completely out of bodies.

27:14.966 --> 27:18.595
We're able bodies.
We're still strong and fit.

27:18.678 --> 27:20.138
My ass hasn't even dropped.

27:21.389 --> 27:23.850
You can volunteer with the VA.

27:23.933 --> 27:27.646
They have, uh, many programs
that work with us on disaster relief.

27:27.729 --> 27:30.148
-I would recommend the USO.
-The USO?

27:30.231 --> 27:33.318
They just sing and dance
and tell jokes, don't they?

27:33.401 --> 27:35.528
They do a lot more than that, sir,
but thank you for--

27:35.612 --> 27:37.530
Okay, first of all, please,
don't thank us anymore.

27:37.614 --> 27:39.991
Your age limits are obsolete.

27:40.075 --> 27:44.120
Doctors today have developed
real age-assessment tools

27:44.204 --> 27:45.372
that prove people can be much younger

27:45.455 --> 27:47.499
than the years reflected
on their birth certificate.

27:47.582 --> 27:49.959
We exercise. We get a lot of fiber.

27:50.043 --> 27:51.920
-We have sex.
-A lot of sex.

27:52.003 --> 27:55.006
Things have changed. Chris Chelios is 45.

27:55.090 --> 27:57.509
He's an all-star defenseman
in the National Hockey League.

27:57.592 --> 27:59.511
Are you saying you'd turn him down?

27:59.594 --> 28:02.472
-Roger Clemens, he wouldn't qualify?
-He's a traitor.

28:03.264 --> 28:05.308
Well, okay. I mean, physically, Denny.

28:05.392 --> 28:08.478
I'm sorry, but thank you
for thinking of your--

28:08.561 --> 28:11.231
-Stop it! You need men!
-We could take steroids.

28:13.191 --> 28:16.111
Are you seriously telling us
there's nothing we can contribute?

28:16.194 --> 28:18.029
We can't drive a plow in a snowstorm?

28:18.113 --> 28:21.199
Well, perhaps you can help recruit
soldiers for the National Guard.

28:21.282 --> 28:23.535
-We don't want to recruit.
-We wanna shoot people.

28:23.618 --> 28:25.245
-Well, I don't wanna shoot anybody.
-I wanna shoot people.

28:25.328 --> 28:26.746
But I can perform services. Some--

28:26.830 --> 28:28.623
The maximum age is 42,

28:28.707 --> 28:31.209
unless you've got previous
military service.

28:31.292 --> 28:34.129
-I do.
-And even then, 75 is too old.

28:34.754 --> 28:38.925
Look, I've tried being nice.
I've thanked you.

28:39.634 --> 28:40.719
Now I need you to leave.

28:43.471 --> 28:44.472
And if we don't?

28:45.849 --> 28:48.184
What, you're gonna call in
your last troop to remove us?

28:49.185 --> 28:50.437
I'll have you arrested.

28:53.314 --> 28:54.607
Come on, Alan.

28:56.234 --> 28:57.235
Let's go to Canada.

28:57.318 --> 28:58.987
(marching band music playing)

29:04.951 --> 29:07.412
MAN: We all wish our public schools
were better.

29:07.495 --> 29:10.790
Personally, I'm a math teacher
in addition to being a principal.

29:10.874 --> 29:12.292
Math is very dear to me.

29:12.917 --> 29:13.877
And?

29:13.960 --> 29:17.005
Well, US students scored lower in math

29:17.088 --> 29:20.258
than those in France, Germany,
Japan, Canada.

29:20.341 --> 29:24.179
But I will say, the Massachusetts
'06 graduating class

29:24.262 --> 29:27.390
posted the highest ACT math scores
of any state.

29:27.474 --> 29:31.269
And our state graduation rate
far exceeds the national average.

29:31.895 --> 29:34.230
You heard her say she felt behind
the kids in England.

29:34.898 --> 29:36.775
MAN: England has problems, too.

29:36.858 --> 29:39.861
Researchers found
that half the teenagers in England

29:39.944 --> 29:42.447
thought there were about
a hundred members of Parliament.

29:42.530 --> 29:47.076
Those kids are about 500 off
for the House of Commons alone.

29:47.160 --> 29:49.037
England isn't all get-out.

29:50.371 --> 29:53.917
-So where do your own kids go?
-The Groton Academy.

29:54.667 --> 29:56.461
-That's a private school?
-Yes.

29:58.922 --> 30:03.218
Look, I'm not going to sit here and deny
that our public schools have problems,

30:03.426 --> 30:06.179
but that doesn't give her the right
to shred tests.

30:06.262 --> 30:08.848
Do you believe
in these standardized tests?

30:08.932 --> 30:12.101
-Not really.
-But you use them all the same?

30:12.393 --> 30:13.686
I don't really have a choice,

30:13.770 --> 30:16.397
not if we want to have
any kind of federal funding.

30:16.481 --> 30:18.024
Ah, the money. (chuckles)

30:18.107 --> 30:20.068
Why stick to your values
when there's cash at stake?

30:20.151 --> 30:22.695
-Hey, do you want my job?
-You make it sound hard.

30:22.779 --> 30:24.572
No. No, it's not hard at all.

30:24.656 --> 30:26.825
I've got veteran teachers retiring,

30:26.908 --> 30:29.702
younger teachers jumping ship
by the droves,

30:29.786 --> 30:30.870
no one to put in their place.

30:30.954 --> 30:32.038
I can't pay them.

30:32.121 --> 30:34.457
So, basically,
you're failing as a principal?

30:34.541 --> 30:37.293
-I'm failing?
-Yes, you just admitted that.

30:37.377 --> 30:38.753
Do you know
what the teacher attrition rate

30:38.837 --> 30:39.879
costs this country annually?

30:39.963 --> 30:42.674
-Seven billion dollars.
-Here we go.

30:42.757 --> 30:46.219
Meanwhile, we waste 600 million
on these assessment exams

30:46.302 --> 30:50.765
to prove our annual yearly progress
to the No Child Left Behind Nazis

30:50.849 --> 30:52.684
so they won't sanction us or fire us!

30:52.767 --> 30:55.478
Give me the seven billion
that goes down the toilet,

30:55.562 --> 30:57.689
-and maybe I can make better schools!
-Jason--

30:57.772 --> 30:58.982
Better yet,
how about the federal government

30:59.315 --> 31:01.484
actually coming through
with some of the funds

31:01.568 --> 31:02.652
they've promised the states

31:02.735 --> 31:05.738
to put their No Child Left Behind
mandates in place?

31:05.822 --> 31:07.240
-Jason.
-I'm the one that's a failure.

31:07.323 --> 31:09.868
-Yeah, yeah, no. It-it's the principals--
-Jason!

31:15.665 --> 31:17.709
So, what do they plan to do now?

31:17.792 --> 31:19.794
I have no idea.
I was never charged with a crime,

31:19.878 --> 31:22.797
but I'm sure I've violated
some morals clause.

31:23.548 --> 31:27.051
-Plus I'm an "at will" employee, so...
-I'm so sorry, Lorraine.

31:27.135 --> 31:29.429
I never intended for you
to lose your job. I just...

31:30.054 --> 31:31.055
Knew something was up.

31:33.516 --> 31:35.476
Katie, still looking for something to do?

31:36.102 --> 31:39.314
An idle brain's the devil's playground.
Am I right, Lorraine?

31:41.733 --> 31:45.028
What part of "I never want to see you
again" did you not understand?

31:45.111 --> 31:47.488
No, Your Honor.
We're here for something else entirely.

31:47.572 --> 31:50.408
After you inspired us to do something,

31:50.491 --> 31:52.660
we went to the National Guard to join up
and they turned us down.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.078
So, now I'm here to bitch about that.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.539
You're too old for the National Guard!

31:56.623 --> 31:58.041
Maybe for combat.

31:58.458 --> 32:00.710
But surely, there must be other ways
we can contribute.

32:00.793 --> 32:02.587
And even if we were of age,

32:02.670 --> 32:05.298
it turns out you can only join
the National Guard

32:05.381 --> 32:06.758
if you're willing to be deployed
in the war.

32:06.841 --> 32:10.094
Apparently, they don't allow you to enlist
only to serve domestically.

32:10.178 --> 32:11.638
Well, there's a reason for that.

32:12.013 --> 32:14.641
If people had the choice
to serve domestically, they'd do so.

32:14.724 --> 32:17.268
In which case,
we'd lose our back-door draft

32:17.352 --> 32:19.479
and not have enough poor people
to fight our war.

32:19.562 --> 32:22.815
Yes, even so, the National Guard
is utterly depleted.

32:22.899 --> 32:25.234
And here we are, ready, willing and able.

32:25.318 --> 32:28.363
Uh, Denny Crane and Alan Shore
reporting for duty, sir.

32:28.446 --> 32:29.948
Ready to serve our country.

32:30.031 --> 32:31.115
Oh, for God's sake.

32:31.199 --> 32:33.034
Look, I agree it seems stupid

32:33.117 --> 32:34.744
that in a time when we're desperate
for more troops,

32:34.827 --> 32:38.206
we're excluding people on age,
or sexual orientation,

32:38.289 --> 32:41.626
or reasons that have nothing to do
with job performance.

32:42.669 --> 32:43.878
It even seems...

32:46.422 --> 32:48.591
-You can say it.
-Outrageous.

32:48.675 --> 32:52.136
But a superior court judge
cannot set military policy.

32:52.220 --> 32:56.933
I admire your motives, Mr. Shore,
but this case is dismissed, too.

32:57.600 --> 32:59.185
There's always the Boy Scouts.

32:59.268 --> 33:03.564
Though I expect you'd have to be young
and straight to get in there, too.

33:04.983 --> 33:06.401
So we can't serve our country?

33:08.903 --> 33:10.154
Our country doesn't want us.

33:23.376 --> 33:26.004
Marlena Hoffman committed a trespass,

33:26.087 --> 33:28.631
destroyed property, shredded tests.

33:28.715 --> 33:31.175
Of course, the school
appropriately expelled her.

33:31.259 --> 33:35.722
This was not an exercise in free speech,
it was an act of vandalism.

33:36.347 --> 33:39.350
Imagine the anarchy we'd see
if they didn't expel her.

33:41.269 --> 33:45.440
We love anarchy. American history
started with the Revolution.

33:45.523 --> 33:48.234
And let's not forget the Boston Tea Party.

33:48.317 --> 33:50.987
Is there a potential for abuses?
Of course. We've seen it.

33:51.070 --> 33:54.449
But we're bouncing this girl
for shredding tests?

33:54.532 --> 33:58.578
Tests which are printed
in tremendous bulk, by the way.

33:59.120 --> 34:00.872
I might argue harmless error.

34:00.955 --> 34:03.082
You're actually
defending her act, counsel?

34:03.166 --> 34:06.377
No, Judge, I am not. She took it too far.

34:06.461 --> 34:10.173
But so is the school taking it too far
with this expulsion.

34:10.256 --> 34:14.135
Your Honor, it is indisputable
that our educational system is in trouble.

34:14.218 --> 34:18.264
Thirty-four percent of fourth graders
cannot read at a basic level.

34:18.347 --> 34:22.060
This in the United States.
What is happening to this country?

34:22.143 --> 34:24.979
It's not enough to wonder
where have all the teachers gone,

34:25.063 --> 34:26.564
but where are they coming from?

34:27.273 --> 34:31.444
This No Child Left Behind Act,
we've got to get rid of it.

34:31.527 --> 34:33.654
It's leaving our kids behind.

34:36.199 --> 34:39.118
Marlena Hoffman destroyed school property.

34:39.202 --> 34:41.829
She committed an act of vandalism,

34:41.913 --> 34:44.916
but she also engaged
in one of the noblest,

34:44.999 --> 34:50.046
most historically acceptable
forms of patriotism, protest.

34:50.755 --> 34:54.050
In a day of unparalleled student apathy,

34:54.133 --> 34:57.762
where undergrads either don't care
or have simply given up,

34:58.513 --> 35:00.890
this is not the kid
we should be kicking out.

35:11.484 --> 35:13.444
Here's an idea that's being kicked around.

35:13.528 --> 35:17.865
The Rapid Response Reserve Corps.
It'll focus on disaster relief.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.867
-This could be exactly what we--
-I already saw that.

35:19.951 --> 35:24.455
It says you have to be retired military
or National Guard personnel.

35:24.539 --> 35:27.500
I'm retired military.
Do we get to shoot people?

35:27.583 --> 35:29.210
-No.
-Keep looking.

35:30.002 --> 35:31.921
-What about the Red Cross?
-Hate needles.

35:32.004 --> 35:34.507
-Or the Peace Corps?
-Pro-peace.

35:35.091 --> 35:36.509
You know, I can't get over the irony.

35:37.093 --> 35:39.387
A long time ago,
I was with Shirley Schmidt,

35:39.470 --> 35:42.098
and now I'm old enough
to be with her granddaughter.

35:42.557 --> 35:45.810
Oh, my God.
You are, like, too ick for words.

35:46.894 --> 35:49.063
-CARL: What's going on?
-We're researching

35:49.147 --> 35:50.231
what military branch to join.

35:50.314 --> 35:53.526
They wanna be one of the few,
the proud, the old.

35:54.068 --> 35:57.029
I got it. I got it.
United States Coast Guard Auxiliary.

35:57.113 --> 36:00.158
A volunteer component of the Coast Guard.
No age limit.

36:00.241 --> 36:02.201
-Guns?
-Probably depth charges, Denny.

36:02.285 --> 36:03.578
Let's go.

36:04.871 --> 36:06.747
I get seasick, but whatever.

36:11.586 --> 36:12.670
Where are they off to?

36:12.753 --> 36:16.174
They've gone to join the Coast Guard.
Happens at a lot of firms.

36:17.133 --> 36:17.967
Got a second?

36:28.311 --> 36:33.357
Okay. Notwithstanding what appears
to be a prostitution theme,

36:33.441 --> 36:38.779
and the occasional associate turning out
to be a fugitive from a foreign country,

36:38.863 --> 36:42.783
and, well, name partners dashing off
to join the Coast Guard...

36:44.202 --> 36:48.539
if you look behind most of the lunacy
that goes on in this place,

36:48.623 --> 36:52.210
you'll, more times than not,
find something else.

36:53.961 --> 36:59.258
An idea or a question,
one that's worth exploring or debating.

36:59.967 --> 37:02.845
I'm not claiming a method
to all our madness, but...

37:04.388 --> 37:08.726
an idea, Carl, that is something.

37:10.561 --> 37:12.855
I think I know that.

37:13.856 --> 37:14.982
You think you know that?

37:16.943 --> 37:18.778
-Then why--
-Uh...

37:21.614 --> 37:25.284
I'm starting to like it here.

37:26.744 --> 37:28.287
That really scares me.

37:29.705 --> 37:30.748
Well, what about me?

37:32.041 --> 37:36.254
Given how much
I'm falling in love with you,

37:37.797 --> 37:41.050
combined with your history
of going through men like Tic Tacs,

37:43.052 --> 37:44.095
that scares me, too.

37:47.431 --> 37:53.646
Carl, I-I know you've never before done
what I'm about to ask you to do, but...

37:54.772 --> 37:56.274
can you just go with it?

37:59.110 --> 37:59.944
I don't know.

38:01.320 --> 38:02.154
Can you try?

38:03.406 --> 38:06.450
Yes. I guess I can try.

38:14.458 --> 38:16.877
(exhales) Okay, so gross.

38:17.962 --> 38:20.172
Uh, the judge has called us back.

38:25.386 --> 38:28.931
I certainly believe any school
has the right to expel

38:29.015 --> 38:31.267
a student who destroys school property.

38:32.268 --> 38:33.644
But shredding a test?

38:33.728 --> 38:36.772
Let's face it, we're not talking about
a lot of vandalism here.

38:36.856 --> 38:38.566
There's a lot more where these came from.

38:39.317 --> 38:42.903
And the controversy surrounding
the efficacy of these tests--

38:42.987 --> 38:45.531
Oh, my God.
I totally feel it swinging my way.

38:47.325 --> 38:48.326
Can I finish?

38:49.243 --> 38:52.705
Miss Hoffman,
you have my admiration for caring,

38:53.956 --> 38:57.877
but you also deserve punishment
for how you demonstrated your concern.

38:57.960 --> 39:02.423
I find a suspension is warranted.
An expulsion is not.

39:02.506 --> 39:04.550
-(gavel thuds)
-JUDGE: And we're adjourned.

39:04.633 --> 39:08.888
Yes! Yes! Thank you, Grammy, so much.

39:08.971 --> 39:10.056
You're welcome, Marlena.

39:11.474 --> 39:13.351
You know, um, I read this study.

39:13.434 --> 39:17.855
People actually get kind of a buzz
from being a benefactor.

39:17.938 --> 39:22.318
Like, it actually makes them wanna do more
for the person they just helped.

39:22.401 --> 39:23.611
How weird is that?

39:24.153 --> 39:27.406
Anyway... (clears throat)
could I have an after-school job?

39:29.241 --> 39:32.495
Wouldn't it just be awesome
to have me around every day?

39:33.412 --> 39:35.456
Totally. Let's go.

39:46.842 --> 39:51.138
You know, it's against Coast Guard policy

39:52.056 --> 39:53.516
to drink while in uniform.

39:55.226 --> 39:58.229
Denny, these aren't real.
We rented them at the costume shop.

39:58.312 --> 40:02.691
Even so, if we don't behave ourselves,
we'll never pass the background check.

40:02.775 --> 40:03.818
We'll get in.

40:04.693 --> 40:06.487
You and I were meant for the Coast Guard.

40:08.781 --> 40:12.618
Hmm, we're gonna be in the military.
Already, my penis feels bigger.

40:14.120 --> 40:16.455
You know, you would think,
with everything going wrong these days,

40:16.539 --> 40:18.249
volunteerism would be down
in this country,

40:18.332 --> 40:20.292
but it's actually up, way up.

40:20.376 --> 40:21.585
Of course, it is. That's the beauty

40:21.669 --> 40:23.587
-of incompetent government.
-(chuckles)

40:23.671 --> 40:25.548
People know they have to fend
for themselves.

40:25.631 --> 40:28.217
That was his plan all along.
He hatched it with Rove.

40:28.300 --> 40:29.427
That was Bush's plan?

40:29.510 --> 40:32.513
Damn right. He's a lot smarter
than people give him credit for.

40:32.972 --> 40:36.475
Act like an idiot for eight years,
then people step up and volunteer.

40:37.017 --> 40:39.520
-Brilliant.
-He didn't need to send us to war.

40:39.603 --> 40:42.314
I was convinced enough with the way
he spoke the English language.

40:42.398 --> 40:44.567
Oh, Alan. Alan, Alan, Alan.

40:44.650 --> 40:46.902
You need to look at the big picture here.

40:47.278 --> 40:48.195
Which is?

40:48.279 --> 40:51.407
How do you nuke Iran and Iraq
without starting a world war?

40:52.283 --> 40:53.868
You claim it was an accident. Whoops.

40:53.951 --> 40:57.288
(chuckles) Who else but George W.
could pull that off?

40:57.371 --> 40:59.373
-Except maybe me.
-You?

40:59.457 --> 41:01.792
Yeah. I would claim
it was the, um, mad cow.

41:02.376 --> 41:05.463
Denny, if you were president, seriously,
you would nuke Iraq and Iran?

41:05.546 --> 41:07.756
-Before breakfast.
-Then what? North Korea?

41:07.840 --> 41:09.049
-Okay.
-Pakistan?

41:09.133 --> 41:10.384
-Why not?
-Afghanistan?

41:10.468 --> 41:11.760
If there's time.

41:12.720 --> 41:15.890
This is the uniform talking.
You wouldn't blow up anybody.

41:15.973 --> 41:18.100
-Oh, really?
-No, you're all talk.

41:18.184 --> 41:21.395
Under all your bravado,
you're a nice guy with a big heart.

41:23.856 --> 41:26.317
Women love men in uniform.

41:27.568 --> 41:29.862
Imagine being Denny Crane and in uniform.

41:29.945 --> 41:31.322
There goes my penis again.

41:31.405 --> 41:32.740
(Alan chuckles)

41:33.657 --> 41:35.743
DENNY: Every time I think
that life can't get any better...

41:37.203 --> 41:39.413
We're in the military.
We have an in-house hooker.

41:39.497 --> 41:40.456
She's not a hooker.

41:40.539 --> 41:43.542
-With a fajita, you say?
-Fatwa. And that was made-up.

41:44.627 --> 41:47.087
Denny, if they try to fire Lorraine,
you need to stand up for her.

41:47.171 --> 41:48.547
She could be in some trouble.

41:48.631 --> 41:50.674
Well, I'll stand up for her
if she'll lie down for me.

41:50.758 --> 41:52.968
You and I need to consider
the less fortunate.

41:53.052 --> 41:54.887
Look how good life has been to us.

41:55.596 --> 41:57.389
Yeah. So good.

41:59.683 --> 42:01.852
-I need a tank.
-(chuckles)

42:01.936 --> 42:03.062
You think they'll issue me a tank?

42:03.604 --> 42:05.689
I don't think the Coast Guard has tanks.

42:05.773 --> 42:08.067
I'd look good in one. Admit it.

42:08.567 --> 42:12.196
Oh, my God, the image of it.
Denny Crane in a tank.

Let's hear it for Mr. Chernack,

42:36.470 --> 42:39.682
this year's MVP
in the predatory lending department!

42:39.765 --> 42:42.059
You're still a hoot, that's what you are.
Melvin Palmer.

42:42.142 --> 42:43.978
-How are you, my friend?
-Homeless.

42:44.061 --> 42:47.356
He made a deal. Now he doesn't like it
'cause it turned out to be a bad deal.

42:47.439 --> 42:49.149
So, what, he just stops
making his payments?

42:49.233 --> 42:51.652
You told me your firm was extremely green.

42:51.735 --> 42:55.447
I am fed up with you global-warming wusses
raining on my electric parade!

42:55.531 --> 42:56.824
This greenie is suing us.

42:56.907 --> 42:59.326
They're asking for all the money
they ever paid us.

42:59.410 --> 43:01.120
Ah. These things happen.

43:02.705 --> 43:05.040
