11:55.237 --> 11:58.176
There is no leaving him.

11:59.980 --> 12:03.086
And he's grown more
and more obsessed with Zoomer.

12:03.086 --> 12:05.926
Andy's success comes
from his singular focus,

12:05.926 --> 12:10.869
and that new focus is his son.

12:10.869 --> 12:14.777
So he wanted to know Bill?

12:14.777 --> 12:16.981

12:16.981 --> 12:19.720
That makes sense, maybe.

I had no idea that Bill
was Zoomer's father.

invited Bill because

12:25.064 --> 12:27.101
he wanted to keep
his critics close.

12:27.101 --> 12:30.976
And I wasn't surprised when
Bill rejected the invitation.

12:30.976 --> 12:33.381
Wait.

12:33.381 --> 12:36.653
So Andy invited me?

12:49.847 --> 12:52.118
I couldn't think of anything
else to do. I was desperate.

12:52.118 --> 12:54.757
And you thought...

12:54.757 --> 12:57.695
that was your second chance
to get out?

13:00.067 --> 13:03.273
And Bill told you to put Rohan
on your list for the boat?

13:03.273 --> 13:04.843
A climatologist
at this sort of thing

13:04.843 --> 13:07.014
doesn't raise any eyebrows.

13:08.016 --> 13:10.989
Yeah, but even a boat has
to dock at some point,

13:10.989 --> 13:13.994
so you needed new passports,
new names.

13:14.796 --> 13:17.936
So you went to the person
Andy would least suspect.

13:17.936 --> 13:20.040
The Argentinian.

Who could get you

13:23.981 --> 13:28.122
David has seen his fair share
of Andy's rage.

13:28.924 --> 13:31.430
And that would explain
why David was

13:31.430 --> 13:33.066
at Bill's room that night.

13:33.066 --> 13:35.772
They were to meet.
The three tea cups.

Rohan.

13:39.178 --> 13:41.015
David.

13:44.790 --> 13:47.895
And you-you think that Andy
is behind all of this?

13:50.200 --> 13:52.305
Maybe.
But Andy's too smart

13:52.305 --> 13:56.012
to invite Bill to his retreat
and have him murdered.

13:56.012 --> 13:58.885
Especially if he knew
about the paternity.

13:58.885 --> 14:00.922
Even if he thought he knew
