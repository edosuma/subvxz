DALE: l see London, l see France.

00:48.075 --> 00:52.011
-Told you, Hank. London and France.
-Ladybird, no!

00:52.246 --> 00:55.215
HANK: Get out of my underwear.
PEGGY: l put those on her.

00:55.315 --> 00:58.113
Ladybird is in heat
and we are out of doggy diapers.

00:58.218 --> 01:00.812
Peggy, how could you? My old underwear?

01:00.921 --> 01:04.254
-l don't even wear that anymore.
-She wouldn't have to wear anything...

01:04.358 --> 01:06.758
if you spayed her,
or hired someone to do it.

01:06.860 --> 01:09.488
l can't have her spayed.
l'm gonna breed her...

01:09.596 --> 01:12.895
-one of these days.
-She's almost 13 years old.

01:13.033 --> 01:17.265
You can't mate a purebred bloodhound
with just any old dog.

01:17.371 --> 01:19.669
That'd be throwing away
seven generations...

01:19.773 --> 01:23.971
-of the finest Georgia inbreeding.
-This could be Ladybird's last heat.

01:24.077 --> 01:26.068
lf you don't do something, and fast...

01:26.180 --> 01:29.240
she is gonna spend the rest of her life
childless and lonely...

in soiled underwear.

01:31.652 --> 01:32.949

01:37.658 --> 01:39.751
Get off a shot, and l wing him !

01:40.194 --> 01:43.322
Dang if he didn't keep going
another mile or two.

01:57.444 --> 02:00.607
-Do you need a license?
-This hat's my license.

02:01.048 --> 02:05.007
Any man who skips out on his bail
can be hunted like an animal...

02:05.319 --> 02:06.718
although not eaten.

02:06.820 --> 02:09.755
All you gotta do
is sit through a four-hour training course.

02:09.856 --> 02:13.314
You're telling me there's a poorly-trained,
quasi-legal police force...

02:13.427 --> 02:16.692
that operates with few, if any,
government controls?

02:18.565 --> 02:20.157
lt's about time.

02:23.503 --> 02:26.802
HANK: Boy, that's some mighty fine hounds
you got yourself there, Buck.

02:26.907 --> 02:30.707
BUCK: That's right. Champions, all of them.

Mr. Strickland, there's something
l'd like to ask you.

02:39.253 --> 02:42.654
Yeah, l'd love to give you a raise,
but the accounting department said:

02:42.756 --> 02:46.089
''Buck, stop letting the employees
put your lemons in a vice.''

02:46.193 --> 02:47.751
Donna said that?

02:48.595 --> 02:49.892
My hands are tied.

02:50.530 --> 02:52.862
Sir, this is about my Ladybird.

02:52.966 --> 02:57.232

Mom and Dad brought her home for me...

03:50.590 --> 03:54.390
on account of me not having
any brothers and sisters to play with.

03:54.494 --> 03:58.453

l would have asked for a monkey.

Tartar scrape? Worm shot?

So, Doctor, is she gonna be a mommy?

06:02.923 --> 06:06.359
l knew it, l'll never get pregnant.
What is wrong with me?

-Peggy, no, this is not your fault.
-He's right, Mrs. Hill.

06:09.996 --> 06:13.488
There's no point in blaming yourself.
lt's Hank's fault.

HANK: What?
DOCTOR: You have a narrow urethra...

06:16.303 --> 06:19.636
and years of chronic tension
have only made it worse.

06:19.873 --> 06:22.000

you'll ever have children.

06:22.108 --> 06:25.475
But that's impossible.

06:25.579 --> 06:29.413
The lab reports confirm it.
Although l suspected as much...

when it took you 30 minutes
to produce a urine sample.

06:32.052 --> 06:34.748
You want it done it quick,
or you want it done right?

06:34.855 --> 06:38.086
Hank, please calm down.
Your urethra will disappear.

06:38.592 --> 06:40.617
lsn't there anything we can do?

to boxer shorts.

06:45.632 --> 06:47.725
Or if that's unacceptable...

06:47.834 --> 06:50.997
l can prescribe
a specific series of sexual techniques.

06:51.104 --> 06:54.505
A series?
Are you suggesting l break the law?

06:54.608 --> 06:57.406

06:58.512 --> 07:00.810
Now, l saw something on the news...

07:00.914 --> 07:04.145
about a procedure
called in vitro fertilization.

07:04.251 --> 07:07.118
They mix your boys
with one of my ladies in a test tube.

07:07.220 --> 07:10.121

Oh, Hank....

07:13.126 --> 07:16.584
lt's perfectly safe, Mr. Hill.
They've tested it on animals.

07:16.696 --> 07:18.664
-Couldn't we just try it?
-No!

07:18.765 --> 07:21.256
lt's wrong on humans
and it's wrong on animals.

07:22.869 --> 07:25.429
l'm sorry, Peggy.
l know you're disappointed...

07:25.539 --> 07:27.666
but that's just how l was raised.

07:27.774 --> 07:30.675
By my mother and father, not a test tube.

07:32.345 --> 07:35.075
So, is Ladybird going to be a mommy?

07:35.982 --> 07:37.279
Sorry, Hank.

07:37.384 --> 07:40.182
Mr. Strickland better refund our $500.

07:40.420 --> 07:44.288
l knew that stud was no good.
He wouldn't even look her in the eye.

07:44.391 --> 07:47.326
lt ain't the stud's fault. lt's Ladybird's.

07:47.827 --> 07:51.661
DR. DOWNS: She's got a narrow uterus.
HANK: No!

07:51.965 --> 07:54.399
So, she can't have puppies?

07:54.734 --> 07:58.727
Stranger things have happened,
but no, she can't.

l'm sorry. l didn't mean to burden you.

08:41.081 --> 08:44.539
Not at all. We were in the same situation
with Buddy's mother.

Turns out there's all sorts of things
you can do.

08:46.920 --> 08:50.083

-Diet, hormones.

09:14.547 --> 09:17.380
Why do you keep giving all the cases
to these other guys?

37:59.350 --> 38:03.150
while still fulfilling my duties
as the child of the house.

38:03.454 --> 38:06.753
Hank, my stepson,
Cotton is small and sneaky.

Couldn't hear you, Hank.

38:18.769 --> 38:22.102
But if you are asking if l am
a licensed professional bounty hunter...

38:22.206 --> 38:25.107
l think this hat speaks for itself.

38:25.242 --> 38:28.268
Well, all right,
l guess l could use some help driving.

38:28.979 --> 38:32.881
Maybe we can put that thing to some use
and sing karaoke to stay awake.

38:33.884 --> 38:36.079
DlDl: Adios.
PEGGY: Drive careful.

39:08.052 --> 39:10.111
[Upbeat instrumental music]

39:17.161 --> 39:21.495
All right. Now, if we're gonna find him
we need to think like my dad would think.

39:24.902 --> 39:27.029
DALE: Eight topless bars and no Cotton.

39:27.137 --> 39:30.231
'Course you'd be a lot more help
if you'd open your eyes, Hank.

39:30.507 --> 39:32.737
Hank, l'm in love.

39:32.843 --> 39:36.404
That was the finest deep-dish pizza
l ever tasted.

39:39.016 --> 39:42.417
HANK: The Andrews Sisters?
l didn't know they were still alive.

39:42.519 --> 39:43.952

HANK: Excuse me, ladies.
That was just wonderful.

40:04.241 --> 40:06.232
My dad has all your records,

40:06.343 --> 40:11.007
And l wonder, coincidentally,
if he might have been in here tonight.

40:11.115 --> 40:12.104
SlNGER: Mm-hmm.

40:12.216 --> 40:15.276
He was here.
That little firecracker grabbed my rear.

40:16.320 --> 40:18.254
He does like the ladies.

40:18.455 --> 40:22.915
Right. So when he figured out l wasn't
really a sister, he started breaking plates.

40:23.027 --> 40:24.460
They threw him out.

40:24.561 --> 40:25.550

Don't stand too close
to the machines, Hank.

41:23.487 --> 41:26.820
The electromagnetic fields
could defertilize you.

41:26.924 --> 41:30.451
That's nonsense, Dale.
And, anyway, Peggy and l have decided...

41:30.561 --> 41:34.224
to stop trying for another baby,
not that it's any of your business.

41:34.732 --> 41:39.032
Jeez, Hank, you shouldn't give up.
l mean, if your dad can have a baby--

41:39.136 --> 41:41.934
This has got nothing to do with my dad.

41:42.139 --> 41:44.334

Hello, Dad.

Don't you unstrap me. l ain't going back.
You can't make me.

42:23.347 --> 42:26.544

l just came to let you know...

Terry or Jerry or something like that.

42:36.226 --> 42:38.558
l think he's a dancer at Chippendales.

42:38.695 --> 42:41.220
Give me his address. l'll gut him.

42:41.932 --> 42:46.335
Dad, l just made him up.
But you see how worked up you got?

42:47.237 --> 42:49.467
You still love Didi. Now come on home.

[Cotton exclaims]

42:50.741 --> 42:52.834
l was going back anyway.

knocked up yet?

42:59.817 --> 43:01.648
No, we've....

43:02.653 --> 43:04.746
l've decided not to have another child.

43:04.855 --> 43:07.221
The whole idea's upset Bobby too much.

43:07.491 --> 43:09.186
l always knew you was a quitter.

43:09.293 --> 43:11.386
You're the one
who always flips up the board...

And we haven't played checkers in years.

43:17.734 --> 43:18.758
[Cotton exclaims]

43:18.869 --> 43:23.602
l get it. l got Didi pregnant,
and you can't with Hank's wife.

43:24.107 --> 43:25.938
So you're flipping up the board.

43:26.043 --> 43:29.206
Yeah, that's right. l'm giving up.
You win. You happy?

43:30.247 --> 43:32.909
Hank, you ain't in competition with me.

43:33.450 --> 43:37.409
Hell, if it's a contest
on who's the better daddy, you win!

43:38.288 --> 43:41.849
l mean, you made Bobby.
All l made was you.

43:42.726 --> 43:44.193
Thanks, Dad.

But what if l keep trying,
and, you know, it doesn't happen?
