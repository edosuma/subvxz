00:07.320 --> 00:08.730

00:16.730 --> 00:22.670

00:32.720 --> 00:37.250

HA HA HA!

00:42.360 --> 00:44.330
STEALING SEEMS LIKE
THE RIGHT STEP

00:44.360 --> 00:47.230
BACK ON THE WRONG ROAD.

00:47.260 --> 00:49.200
Ace: THERE'S THE CAR
STOLEN FROM THE PRISON.

00:49.230 --> 00:52.600
Danger: YEAH, BUT WHO'S

00:57.240 --> 01:00.540
SO THAT ANSWERS

01:00.580 --> 01:05.350
STRANGE. I NEVER KNEW
MASSIVE HAD A TASTE FOR ART.

01:05.380 --> 01:06.650
WHEN YOU'RE THAT BIG, YOU
PRETTY MUCH HAVE

01:06.680 --> 01:08.420
A TASTE FOR ANYTHING.

01:08.450 --> 01:12.560

HUH? OOF!

04:11.030 --> 04:12.600

04:12.640 --> 04:14.340

04:57.650 --> 05:01.650
UNH! OH, HEY. YEAH,

05:01.690 --> 05:06.790
NOW I THINK I'M GONNA TAKE
A LITTLE NAPPY-POO.

05:13.560 --> 05:17.430
LET'S GET SLEEPING BEAUTY
BACK TO HQ.

05:17.470 --> 05:21.410
A-HA!

05:21.440 --> 05:25.480
COME ON, STEP OUT, YOU.

05:25.510 --> 05:26.710
DRAT!

05:26.740 --> 05:30.080
OOH, I'LL GET YOU
NEXT TIME.

05:30.110 --> 05:35.920
THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY
TO CATCH A WASCAWWY WABBIT.

05:35.950 --> 05:37.690
I HEARD THEY TRANSFERRED

05:37.720 --> 05:40.520
THE GREATEST CRIMINALS
OF ALL TIME

05:40.560 --> 05:41.760
TO THIS PRISON.

05:41.790 --> 05:43.690
WELL, WELL, WELL.

05:43.730 --> 05:46.730
IF IT ISN'T THE LOSER-TICS.

05:46.760 --> 05:49.070
WHAT BRINGS YOU
TO THE SLAMMER?

05:49.100 --> 05:51.500
OTTO THE ODD.

05:51.540 --> 05:54.800
ALWAYS NICE TO SEE
AN UNFRIENDLY FACE.

05:54.840 --> 05:57.810
LOCKED AWAY
WHERE IT BELONGS.

05:57.840 --> 06:02.450
I MISSED YOU, TOO.

06:02.480 --> 06:04.950
PERHAPS WE MIGHT
EXCHANGE EMAILS.

06:04.980 --> 06:07.520
YOU CAN ADD ME
TO YOUR BUDDY LIST.

06:07.550 --> 06:12.620
MORE LIKE ADD YOU TO MY "ODD
LITTLE BUGS TO STOMP ON" LIST.

06:12.660 --> 06:14.960
HA HA! NOW,
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

06:17.690 --> 06:21.500
LOONATICS! I'M GLAD
YOU COULD COME.

06:21.530 --> 06:22.830
YES, YES. OF COURSE
YOU ARE.

06:22.870 --> 06:24.630
IF YOU WANT AN AUTOGRAPH,

06:24.670 --> 06:26.040
YOU'LL HAVE TO GO
THROUGH MY WEBSITE.

06:30.140 --> 06:33.910
SO MR. PERSONALITY MANAGED TO
SLIP OUT OF HIS CUFFS.

06:33.940 --> 06:37.580
YES. ONE MINUTE,
MASSIVE WAS HERE.

06:37.610 --> 06:38.980
THE NEXT, GONE.

06:39.020 --> 06:41.080
WELL, HE WOULDN'T
HAVE ESCAPED

06:41.120 --> 06:42.720
IF YOU USED SOMETHING BETTER

06:42.750 --> 06:47.520
THAN THIS FLIMSY
LASER BAR SECURITY.

06:47.560 --> 06:49.960
YYAAAAAHHH-OHH-OH!

06:49.990 --> 06:52.760
A LITTLE HELP, PLEASE!

06:52.800 --> 06:53.930
AHH-HA HA HA!

07:03.610 --> 07:06.580
POLICE REMAIN PUZZLED
BY LAST WEEK'S DISAPPEARANCE

07:06.610 --> 07:10.550
OF ACMETROPOLIS' TOP ARTIST
SCOOTER BULLOCK.

07:10.580 --> 07:13.880
SEVERAL OF HIS PAINTINGS
WERE REPORTED STOLEN

07:13.920 --> 07:17.520
FROM THE ACMETROPOLIS
MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS.

07:28.700 --> 07:34.840
WET'S SEE IF I CAN FWUSH
THIS WABBIT OUT OF HIS HOLE.

07:34.870 --> 07:41.180
AH, WABBIT TWACKS.

07:41.210 --> 07:45.050
WOOKS WIKE WABBIT SEASON
HAS BEGUN.

07:45.080 --> 07:48.220
NO WABBIT'S EVER ESCAPED
MY INVISIBLE NEUTWON NET.

07:50.650 --> 07:53.920
I THINK IT'S KINDA HARD
TO THINK

07:53.960 --> 07:55.260
ON AN EMPTY STOMACH.

07:59.130 --> 08:01.200
HMM...

08:01.230 --> 08:02.900
HA!

08:02.930 --> 08:05.570
- AAHH!

08:07.740 --> 08:10.170
UHH...

08:10.210 --> 08:14.810
NO! SLAM! NO! NOOOOOO!

08:17.580 --> 08:21.120
WAAAAA-HEE-HEE-YAAH!

08:21.150 --> 08:22.620
OOF!

08:28.020 --> 08:29.860
ACE, CHECK THIS OUT.

08:29.890 --> 08:32.860
LOOKS LIKE MASSIVE'S
GOT A NEW INTEREST.

08:32.900 --> 08:35.330
THIS ONE IN SINGING
SPACE COWBOYS.

08:35.360 --> 08:38.740
THAT'S THE WESTERN MUSEUM,

08:38.770 --> 08:41.240
BELONGING TO HOPALONG CHIRON

08:41.270 --> 08:44.770
AND HIS ROBO-HORSE THUNDER.

08:44.810 --> 08:46.610
LET'S JET!

09:00.120 --> 09:02.130
I LEFT SLAM AND REV AT HQ

09:02.160 --> 09:03.890
TO KEEP TABS ON MASSIVE.

09:06.760 --> 09:08.600
ANY SIGN OF HIM, GUYS?

09:13.770 --> 09:16.370
YEAH, YOU DON'T SAY.

09:16.410 --> 09:19.980
UH, BUT DON'T.
MY STOMACH'S TURNING.

09:20.010 --> 09:22.650
REV, YOU'LL BE OUR EYES
AND EARS.

09:22.680 --> 09:25.680
OK, TIME TO SADDLE UP,
BOYS AND GIRLS.

09:28.650 --> 09:32.120
DON'T SEE
MR. MEAN-AND-GREEN ANYWHERE.

09:37.860 --> 09:40.160
LET'S SPREAD OUT,
LOONATICS.

09:46.770 --> 09:47.970
OH!

09:48.000 --> 09:49.770
HEY!

09:49.810 --> 09:52.140
AN "EXCUSE ME" MIGHT BE
IN ORDER.

09:52.180 --> 09:58.310
HMM. IT LOOKS LIKE MASSIVE
FOUND WHAT HE CAME FOR.

09:58.350 --> 10:01.420
WHAT WOULD MASSIVE WANT
WITH HOPALONG'S HORSE?

10:01.450 --> 10:05.050
HA HA HA!

10:05.090 --> 10:07.120
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE, SLIM!

10:07.160 --> 10:10.960
WIKE SHOOTING BUNNIES
IN A BAWWEL.

10:10.990 --> 10:13.100
ONE OF MY FAVOWITE SPORTS.

10:13.130 --> 10:15.700
NO ONE STANDS UP
TO MASSIVE.

10:19.770 --> 10:21.710
HA HA! LOOKS LIKE
IT'S TIME

10:21.740 --> 10:24.310
TO KICK SOME MASSIVE BUTT.

10:24.340 --> 10:26.910
GOTCHA, WABBIT!

10:26.940 --> 10:30.310
HUAH! AAH--UNH!

10:30.350 --> 10:32.350
HOW EMBARRASSING.

10:41.320 --> 10:43.090
DID I JUST SEE
WHAT'S NOT THERE?

10:45.260 --> 10:50.070
HI-HO, THUNDER! AWAY!

10:50.100 --> 10:52.840
THAT WASCAWWY WABBIT
IS PWOVING

10:52.870 --> 10:55.910
A TOUGHER ADVERSAWWY
THAN I PWEDICTED.

10:55.940 --> 10:57.410
NO MATTER.

10:57.440 --> 11:01.380
EWECTWO J. FUDD
IS THE GWEATEST HUNTER

11:01.410 --> 11:03.980
WHO EVER WIVED!

11:04.010 --> 11:06.320
SOON ENOUGH, THAT WABBIT

11:06.350 --> 11:10.190
WILL BE MY GWEATEST TWOPHY.

11:27.200 --> 11:30.070
TECH, WERE YOU ABLE
TO FIND ANYTHING

11:30.110 --> 11:32.480
THAT WE CAN USE
TO TRACK MASSIVE?

11:34.980 --> 11:38.010
I DID A COMPLETE
BODY-SWEEP OF DUCK,

11:38.050 --> 11:40.950
AND FOUND SOMETHING
VERY STRANGE.

11:40.980 --> 11:44.850
JUST TELL ME
IT'S NOT MOVING. UGH.

11:44.890 --> 11:48.420
IT'S A HAIR
THAT DOESN'T BELONG TO HIM

11:48.460 --> 11:50.130
OR ANY OF US.

11:50.160 --> 11:53.000
I RAN IT THROUGH
MY D.N.A. RECONSTRUCTOR.

11:53.030 --> 11:55.460
THE ANALYSIS SHOULD BE
JUST ABOUT READY.

12:05.510 --> 12:08.540
I KNOW HIM!
THAT'S ELECTRO J. FUDD.

12:08.580 --> 12:11.250
HE COMES FROM A LONG LINE
OF FAMOUS HUNTERS.

12:11.280 --> 12:14.120
I WONDER WHAT HE'S DOING
WITH MASSIVE?

12:14.150 --> 12:16.150
THAT LOSER?

12:16.190 --> 12:19.790
FUDD? DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
MUCH OF A HUNTER.

12:19.820 --> 12:21.190
ARE YOU KIDDING?

12:21.220 --> 12:22.430
THE FUDDS HAVE BEEN
GREAT HUNTERS

12:22.460 --> 12:24.830
SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME.

12:28.870 --> 12:30.500
THERE WAS ELMER J. FUDD,

12:30.530 --> 12:34.170
WHO HUNTED DOWN THE WORLD'S
BIGGEST SQUIRREL.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.510
UNTIL THE SQUIRREL
WENT NUTS.

12:36.540 --> 12:38.810
NANOOKA J. FUDD,
KNOWN FOR HIS HUNTING

12:38.840 --> 12:42.550
OF AQUATIC MAMMALS.
BEFORE HE DISAPPEARED.

12:42.580 --> 12:46.420
AHAB J. FUDD, WHO HUNTED
A MYSTERIOUS GREAT WHALE,

12:46.450 --> 12:48.080
BEFORE THE BIG CHOMP.

12:48.120 --> 12:50.090
AND CRO-MAGNON J. FUDD,
WHO HUNTED

12:50.120 --> 12:51.550
THE GREAT WOOLY MAMMOTH.

12:51.590 --> 12:54.060
BEFORE THE BIG STOMP.

12:54.090 --> 12:58.490
BUT WHAT COULD HE POSSIBLY
BE HUNTING IN ACMETROPOLIS?

13:01.500 --> 13:04.900
LOOKS LIKE A BREAK-IN
AT GRANNY FUDGE COOKIES.

13:04.930 --> 13:08.400
I HAVE A FEELING
WHEN WE FIND MASSIVE,

13:08.440 --> 13:10.540
WE'LL FIND FUDD.

13:19.120 --> 13:23.620
OOH, I WOVE IT WHEN A PWAN
COMES TOGETHER.

13:23.650 --> 13:27.460
THAT WABBIT'S PWAYING
WIGHT INTO MY HANDS.

13:27.490 --> 13:28.860
HA HA HA!

13:43.010 --> 13:44.470
OH, HOORAY!

13:47.510 --> 13:49.280
THANK YOU!

13:51.680 --> 13:56.050
OUR SECRET WEAPON
AGAINST A COOKIE ATTACK.

13:56.090 --> 13:58.290
SLAM, YOU'RE DESPICABLE.

14:02.260 --> 14:05.030
WE'VE GOTTA GET MASSIVE
OUT IN THE OPEN.

14:05.060 --> 14:07.560
TECH, YOU READY?
GOOD TO GO!

14:07.600 --> 14:10.970
SPREAD OUT!

14:11.000 --> 14:15.910
(HUMMING
RIDE OF THE VALKYRIES)

14:18.170 --> 14:20.080
OK, BUSTER.

14:20.110 --> 14:22.150
LET'S SEE
IF YOU HAVE A TASTE

14:22.180 --> 14:27.320
FOR THE POWER-EGGS
OF DANGER DUCK!

14:27.350 --> 14:28.550
WHAAA--

14:28.580 --> 14:30.050
OOF!

14:34.290 --> 14:36.460
NICE WAY TO TREAT
ONE OF ACMETROPOLIS'

14:36.490 --> 14:38.490
BELOVED CRIMEFIGHTERS.

14:41.200 --> 14:45.100
REV! THE OLD CIRCLE
STUMBLE PLAY.

14:45.130 --> 14:46.500
OHH!

14:46.540 --> 14:48.100
MM, THE CIRCLE STUMBLE
PLAY

14:48.140 --> 14:49.270
IS ONE OF MY ALL-TIME
FAVORITES!

14:49.310 --> 14:51.210
I'M ALL OVER IT!

14:51.240 --> 14:54.610
Fudd: COME TO PAPA!

14:54.640 --> 14:57.410
I CERTAINLY HOPE YOU'RE NOT
THINKING OF RUNNING THE OLD

14:57.450 --> 15:01.080
CIRCLE STUMBLE PLAY
WITHOUT DANGER DU--

15:01.120 --> 15:03.350
HUAHH! WHA-WHA-WHA...

15:05.490 --> 15:08.360
NOT EXACTLY THE MOVE
I HAD IN MIND.

15:11.330 --> 15:14.000
GOT YA RIGHT IN MY SIGHTS.

15:14.030 --> 15:16.500
Danger:

15:16.530 --> 15:18.230
OOF! WHOA!

15:32.450 --> 15:33.580
WHAA

15:45.330 --> 15:48.660
EHH, WHAT'S UP, FUDD?

15:48.700 --> 15:50.330
UH-OH. JIG'S UP.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.580
AAHHH-HA-HA!

15:59.610 --> 16:01.440
OH. AHEM.

16:01.480 --> 16:04.210
OLD METAL-HEAD
WAS NOTHING BUT A ROBOT.

16:04.250 --> 16:06.450
MASSIVE'S C.P.U.
MIGHT JUST CONTAIN

16:06.480 --> 16:08.580
SOME USEFUL INFORMATION.

16:08.620 --> 16:12.320
TECH, GET THAT ROBOT BRAIN
BACK TO THE LAB.

16:12.360 --> 16:15.190
WE GOTTA LEARN ALL ABOUT IT
AND FUDD.

16:28.100 --> 16:32.580
EVEWY TIME I HAVE
THAT WABBIT WOCKED IN,

16:32.610 --> 16:36.110
THAT MISEWABLE DUCK
SCREWS IT UP.

16:36.150 --> 16:40.080
SEEMS THAT I'VE BEEN HUNTING
THE WONG WOONATIC.

16:40.120 --> 16:43.550
NOW IT'S DUCK SEASON.

16:43.590 --> 16:45.150
HEH HEH HEH.

17:06.340 --> 17:07.810
I DID SOME SNOOPING
AND FOUND

17:07.840 --> 17:10.810
THAT HOPALONG CHIRON
AND GRANNY FUDGE

17:10.850 --> 17:12.820
ALSO WENT MISSING
AROUND THE TIME

17:12.850 --> 17:15.350
SCOOTER BULLOCK DISAPPEARED.

17:15.380 --> 17:17.550
ALL TOPS IN THEIR FIELDS.

17:17.590 --> 17:19.220
SO WHAT'S THE CONNECTION

17:19.260 --> 17:21.460
BETWEEN A GREAT HUNTER
LIKE FUDD

17:21.490 --> 17:23.760
AND A RAMPAGING ROBOT?

17:23.790 --> 17:28.360
WELL, HUNTERS ARE KNOWN
FOR THEIR DECOYS.

17:28.400 --> 17:30.200
A DECOY

17:30.230 --> 17:33.640
MAYBE THE FUDDMEISTER
HAS A COLLECTION GOING ON.

17:33.670 --> 17:35.340
AND ALL THAT'S LEFT
IS TO ADD

17:35.370 --> 17:38.840
THE TOP CRIMEFIGHTER
IN ACMETROPOLIS.

17:38.870 --> 17:41.440
WELL, THAT WOULD HAVE
TO BE ME.

17:41.480 --> 17:43.680
THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE ACE.

17:43.710 --> 17:45.380
VERY FUNNY.

17:45.410 --> 17:48.850
IT'S TIME TO TURN
THE TABLES ON THE HUNTER

17:48.880 --> 17:51.820
AND MAKE HIM THE HUNTEE.

18:00.530 --> 18:02.600
WHEN FUDD SEES ME ALL ALONE,

18:02.630 --> 18:05.570
HE WON'T BE ABLE TO RESIST
MAKING HIS MOVE.

18:05.600 --> 18:07.470
ISN'T THIS PRETTY RISKY?

18:07.500 --> 18:09.740
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO FLUSH HIM OUT

18:09.770 --> 18:15.210
AND GET HIM TO LEAD US TO WHERE
HE'S HOLDING THE OTHERS.

18:15.240 --> 18:17.480
WORLD'S BEST CRIMEFIGHTER,
MY EYE.

18:17.510 --> 18:19.750
I DON'T REMEMBER VOTING
ON THAT.

18:19.780 --> 18:23.450
IF YOU'RE A RABBIT, EVERYONE'S
KISSING YOUR FLUFFY WHITE.

18:23.490 --> 18:25.920
BUT IF YOU'RE A DUCK,
IT'S A BOOT TO THE KIESTER

18:25.950 --> 18:27.890
AND A TRIP
TO THE CHINESE DELI,

18:27.920 --> 18:32.760
WHERE YOU HANG UPSIDE-DOWN
INSIDE A GOLDEN GLASS CAGE.

18:32.800 --> 18:35.930
IT'S ALL SO DESPICABLE.

18:35.960 --> 18:37.870
FIRE!

18:37.900 --> 18:42.570
I GOTCHA!
HEY!

18:42.610 --> 18:45.370
DON'T BOTHER TO TWY
QUACKING OUT.

18:45.410 --> 18:48.840
IT'S COATED
WITH ANTI-QUACKING GEL.

18:48.880 --> 18:50.480
LET ME OUT OF HERE

18:50.510 --> 18:53.750
OR FACE THE WRATH
OF DANGER DUCK.

18:53.780 --> 18:58.750
OOH. IT'S AN HONOR TO MEET
THE GWEATEST OF AWW TIME.

18:58.790 --> 19:00.860
I'LL SHOW--

19:00.890 --> 19:05.430
DID YOU JUST CALL ME
THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME?

19:05.460 --> 19:09.730
WHY, YES I DID.
BECAUSE IT'S TWUE.

19:09.770 --> 19:12.700
HA, I KNEW IT!
WHOA!

19:12.740 --> 19:14.600
I AM THE GREATEST--

19:21.410 --> 19:24.710
HEY, SHOULDN'T I BE TAKING
YOU BACK TO PRISON?

19:29.020 --> 19:33.390
AHH! EXCELLENT WORK,
MR. FUDD.

19:33.420 --> 19:38.490
OF COURSE. I'M THE GWEATEST
HUNTER OF AWW TIME.

19:38.530 --> 19:41.230
I ALWAYS BWING IN MY DUCK.

19:41.260 --> 19:43.700
UNNH! AHH!

19:43.730 --> 19:46.470
AND NOW FOR MY WEWARD.

19:46.500 --> 19:50.010
HA HA HA, IN TIME.

19:50.040 --> 19:54.410
I HAVE A VEWY SPECIAL
WEWARD FOR YOU.

19:57.480 --> 20:01.020
LIKE WHAT I'VE DONE
WITH THE PLACE?

20:01.050 --> 20:03.750
WOW, CHECK OUT THE BLING.

20:03.790 --> 20:08.620
DO ALL THE OTHER PRISONERS
GET SUCH A SNAZZY CELL?

20:08.660 --> 20:10.830
MAYBE CRIME DOES PAY.

20:10.860 --> 20:12.800
NOT EXACTLY.

20:12.830 --> 20:16.030
YOU MIGHT SAY I GAVE MYSELF
A PROMOTION

20:16.060 --> 20:20.940
AND I'M NOW THE ONE
IN CHARGE.

20:22.840 --> 20:26.710
DUCK. SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

20:26.740 --> 20:28.510
WHAA-HA-HA-HA!

20:28.540 --> 20:29.980
SO THE TOP WATCHDOG HERE

20:30.010 --> 20:32.550
IS NOTHING BUT A BUCKET
OF BOLTS.

20:32.580 --> 20:37.450
JUST LIKE THE ONE
OF MASSIVE YOU DESTROYED.

20:37.490 --> 20:40.520
MASSIVE WAS
AN EXCEWWENT DECOY.

20:40.560 --> 20:42.490
NNGAH!

20:42.530 --> 20:46.430
THE REAL MASSIVE
IS STILL LOCKED UP NEARBY.

20:46.460 --> 20:50.430
FANTASTICALLY REAL,
AREN'T THEY?

20:50.470 --> 20:53.970
BOINKY-OINK
WAS THE GREATEST CLOWN

20:54.000 --> 20:57.070
IN INTERGALACTIC HISTORY.

20:57.110 --> 20:58.970
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
THE WORLD NEEDS.

20:59.010 --> 21:00.910
ANOTHER ANNOYING CLOWN.

21:00.940 --> 21:04.910
IT'S NOT LIKE HE'S
A REAL ACTION HERO.

21:04.950 --> 21:08.880
AH, THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE HERE.

21:08.920 --> 21:13.420
IN YOUR HONOR,
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU

21:13.460 --> 21:16.590
A PLACE FOR ALL ETERNITY.

21:16.630 --> 21:20.030
UM...UH, WHAT EXACTICALLY
DO YOU MEAN BY

21:20.060 --> 21:22.430
"A PLACE FOR ETERNITY"?

21:26.070 --> 21:30.010
AS THE GREATEST SHOWMAN
OF ALL TIME,

21:30.040 --> 21:35.840
I ENJOY COLLECTING THE GREATEST
FIGURES OF ALL TIME.

21:35.880 --> 21:37.450
SCOOTER BULLOCK.

21:37.480 --> 21:40.980
THE GREATEST ARTIST
OF ALL TIME.

21:41.020 --> 21:43.450
HOPALONG CHIRON.

21:43.490 --> 21:47.020
THE GREATEST SINGING
SPACE COWBOY

21:47.060 --> 21:48.790
OF ALL TIME.

21:48.820 --> 21:50.590
GRANNY FUDGE.

21:50.630 --> 21:55.430
THE GREATEST COOKIE MAKER
OF ALL TIME.

21:55.460 --> 21:59.840
HEY. THAT'S ALL THE STUFF
OLD METAL-HEAD SNATCHED.

21:59.870 --> 22:03.840
SOON, YOU'LL
TAKE YOUR PLACE

22:03.870 --> 22:06.140
ALONGSIDE ALL THE OTHERS.

22:06.170 --> 22:08.710
'SCUSE ME, I DON'T WANT
TO SEEM UNGRATEFUL,

22:08.740 --> 22:12.110
BUT GREATEST ACTION HERO
OR NOT,

22:12.150 --> 22:14.780
NO ONE IS FREEZING
THIS DUCK.

22:14.820 --> 22:17.720
OH, NO, NO, NO.

22:17.750 --> 22:21.560
I BELIEVE THERE'S BEEN
A LITTLE MISUNDERSTANDING.

22:21.590 --> 22:25.390
HA HA HA, YOU'RE BEING
FROZEN AS THE GREATEST

22:25.430 --> 22:31.570
SCREW-UP ACTION HERO
OF ALL TIME! HA HA HA!

22:31.600 --> 22:33.000
SCREW

22:33.040 --> 22:38.470
HEY! I DON'T HAVE TO STAND
FOR THIS.

22:38.510 --> 22:40.080
AAH!

22:40.110 --> 22:43.580
ACTUALLY, YOU'LL BE
LYING DOWN

22:43.610 --> 22:46.450
WITH AN ANVIL ON YOUR HEAD.

22:46.480 --> 22:52.660
AND YOU, MY DEAR
HUNTER FWIEND,

22:52.690 --> 22:53.890
I HAVE QUITE A SURPRISE
FOR YOU, TOO.

22:53.920 --> 22:57.760
A SUWPWISE

22:57.790 --> 22:59.190
HOW DEWIGHTFUL!

22:59.230 --> 23:03.630
AS THE GALAXY'S GREATEST
HUNTER,

23:03.670 --> 23:06.770
I'M GONNA FREEZE YOU, TOO.

23:06.800 --> 23:09.100
YOU CAN'T BE SEWIOUS.

23:09.140 --> 23:13.610
OH, I AM SEWIOUS.

23:13.640 --> 23:17.550
YOUR DISPLAY WILL BE
RIGHT NEXT TO DANGER DUCK.

23:17.580 --> 23:19.650
YOUR GREATEST CONQUEST.

23:22.820 --> 23:25.120
WAIT! YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

23:25.150 --> 23:27.860
I'M SCHEDULED
FOR A FEATHER WAX NEXT WEEK.

23:27.890 --> 23:30.560
COME ON, BALDY.

23:30.590 --> 23:34.160
OH, MY.
THAT IS NO WAY TO BEHAVE

23:34.200 --> 23:36.830
AS GUESTS IN MY HOME.

23:39.030 --> 23:42.740
OLLY OLLY OXEN FREE!

23:42.770 --> 23:44.770
YOU CAN RUN,

23:44.810 --> 23:47.880
BUT THERE'S NO PLACE
TO HIDE!

23:51.650 --> 23:52.850
HUH?

23:52.880 --> 23:55.050
THE MOUNTAIN CLIMBER.

23:55.080 --> 23:57.490
AND LITTLE MURRAY.

23:57.520 --> 24:00.090
HEH. HEH HEH HEH.

24:03.530 --> 24:05.590
I KNOW WHERE YOU ARE.

24:05.630 --> 24:09.260
HUH? OH. NOT HERE.

24:09.300 --> 24:13.500
HMM...

24:17.540 --> 24:20.710
HA HA HA!

24:23.680 --> 24:27.920
MM, YOU'RE MINE NOW.

24:27.950 --> 24:30.220
GOTCHA!

24:30.250 --> 24:32.890
THE COWBOY?

24:32.920 --> 24:36.630
MMM, HMM-HMM!

24:51.770 --> 24:53.640
- SHH!

25:00.020 --> 25:03.650
GOTCHA! HUH? OHH...

25:25.270 --> 25:27.140
NO!

25:30.980 --> 25:34.080
EHH, WHAT'S UP, DOC?

25:34.120 --> 25:36.220
B

25:36.250 --> 25:40.260
I FIGURED ONE GOOD
ROBOT SCAM DESERVES ANOTHER.

25:40.290 --> 25:44.690
VERY GOOD.
EXCEPT FOR ONE THING.

25:52.970 --> 25:57.070
I FIGURED
ONE ROBOT SCAM

25:57.110 --> 25:59.840
ROBOT SCAM DESERVED
ANOTHER ROBOT SCAM.
