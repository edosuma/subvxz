01:30.960 --> 01:32.540
So, Rich, I'm driving
along in my car,

01:32.540 --> 01:35.040
and all of a sudden it started
making these weird noises.

01:35.040 --> 01:36.050
(distant siren wailing)
What noises?

01:36.050 --> 01:38.050
K-pec, k-pec,
k-pec, then...

01:38.050 --> 01:40.020
(blowing raspberry)

01:40.020 --> 01:42.050
What a bod.

01:42.050 --> 01:44.550
Who cares about the body
if the engine doesn't work?

01:44.550 --> 01:47.060
It kept going k-pec,
k-pec, k-pec,

01:47.060 --> 01:48.560
I took it to the Fonz

01:48.560 --> 01:50.030
when it started going
k-pok, k-pok--

01:50.030 --> 01:53.060
K-wow, k-wow, k-wow.

01:54.060 --> 01:55.570
Hi.

01:55.570 --> 01:57.070
My name's
Ralph Malph.

01:57.070 --> 01:58.570
I start college
in the fall.

01:58.570 --> 02:00.370
(siren blaring)

02:02.070 --> 02:04.160
Air raid! Air raid!

02:04.660 --> 02:06.160
Don't panic,
this is just a drill.

02:06.660 --> 02:07.580
Everybody head for
the basement.

02:07.910 --> 02:11.000
Al, Al, a fire engine
went by, that's all.

02:11.500 --> 02:13.000
Oh, pshaw,

02:13.000 --> 02:15.470
I never get to wear
the helmet.

02:15.800 --> 02:18.810
We're starting our
own fire right here.

02:19.140 --> 02:21.720
You're doing real good,
Gina.

02:21.720 --> 02:23.230
Hey, come here,
Ralph.

02:23.230 --> 02:24.730
What are you doing?

02:24.730 --> 02:25.730
I was right in the middle
of getting...

02:25.730 --> 02:27.730
You were right in the middle
of getting nothing.

02:27.730 --> 02:30.070
She's helping me out--
that happens to be my niece.

02:30.320 --> 02:32.850
Didn't you see
the resemblance?

02:34.740 --> 02:36.320
No.
No.

02:36.320 --> 02:39.080
Well, she's not
wearing a hat.

02:39.490 --> 02:41.080
Darling, you better
get down from there.

02:41.080 --> 02:42.580
You'll get hurt.
Come on.

02:42.580 --> 02:43.580
Aren't you cold?

02:43.580 --> 02:45.580
There's such a draft, here,
put this sweater on.

02:45.580 --> 02:47.080
It's too cold.

02:47.080 --> 02:49.090
(girls screaming)

02:49.090 --> 02:51.090
Oh, oh...

02:51.090 --> 02:52.090
Oh, it was awful.

02:52.090 --> 02:54.090
It was terrible.

03:00.100 --> 03:02.930
Oh, boy, I need some water.

03:03.220 --> 03:05.050
Fonz, was-was your
garage on fire?

03:05.270 --> 03:06.350
I'll tell you something,

03:06.350 --> 03:07.850
it was horrible...

03:07.850 --> 03:09.360
maybe oily rags...

03:09.360 --> 03:11.360
flames... swoosh!

03:11.360 --> 03:13.360
It was just terrible!

03:13.360 --> 03:16.200
Who's the new chick
with the hammer?

03:16.480 --> 03:19.070
Fonz, Fonz, listen,
you gotta sit down.

03:19.570 --> 03:21.570
Sit down and
take it easy.

03:21.570 --> 03:23.820
All right, now-now,
tell us what happened.

03:24.040 --> 03:26.620
I was in my office,
taking a nap, you know?

03:27.120 --> 03:28.630
And I was just--
this beautiful dream.

03:29.130 --> 03:30.630
I was on this
tropical island

03:31.130 --> 03:32.630
with two beautiful
chicks.

03:33.130 --> 03:34.130
Only two, Fonz?
Well, it was a--

03:34.580 --> 03:36.130
it was a short nap,
Malph.
Oh.

03:36.630 --> 03:38.130
But I'm telling you
something,

03:38.130 --> 03:40.140
if that guy wasn't there
that dragged me out,

03:40.140 --> 03:41.550
it would have been
curtains for the Fonz.

03:41.890 --> 03:42.840
Well, who? Who did it?

03:43.140 --> 03:45.230
I don't know, these two hands
came through the smoke,

03:45.230 --> 03:47.230
pulled me out,
that's all I know, huh?

03:47.230 --> 03:48.600
Pulled me out
of the garage.

03:48.900 --> 03:50.400
Okay, go on, Fonz.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.320
The next thing I know,

03:52.320 --> 03:55.320
I am lying flat on my back
on the sidewalk.

03:55.770 --> 03:58.320
And then some fireman wants
to give me a kiss.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.820
Oh, no.

04:02.330 --> 04:05.080
No, see, he was giving you
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

04:06.360 --> 04:08.870
I knew that.

04:09.370 --> 04:11.670
He just should have told me
before I dented his helmet.

04:11.870 --> 04:13.950
Well-well, tell me,

04:14.450 --> 04:16.370
did you ever figure out
who it was that saved you?

04:16.760 --> 04:17.339
No.

04:17.839 --> 04:18.839
Somewhere out there,

04:18.839 --> 04:20.839
there is a guy walking
around in a Jefferson jacket,

04:20.839 --> 04:23.300
who saved the Fonz

04:23.300 --> 04:25.850
from being a barbecued
chicken.

04:25.850 --> 04:27.350
And I want to tell you
something.

04:27.850 --> 04:28.850
I want to tell you
something.

04:28.850 --> 04:30.850
Any favor he wants,
he gets.

04:31.270 --> 04:32.860
CROWD:
Wow!

04:33.270 --> 04:34.860
You need some
more water?
Oh, yeah.

04:34.860 --> 04:36.360
All right, more water,
more water,

04:36.360 --> 04:38.360
the man needs more water!

04:42.120 --> 04:44.120
Hey, Pots,

04:44.120 --> 04:46.120
what, did your father
make you clean the
chimney again?

04:46.120 --> 04:47.620
It was terrible!

04:47.620 --> 04:48.620
Wait a minute.

04:49.120 --> 04:50.120
Your were in
the fire?
Yeah.

04:50.120 --> 04:51.960
Here, have some
water.
Thanks.

04:52.210 --> 04:53.790
He's got a Jefferson jacket.

04:54.290 --> 04:55.300
Potsie saved you.

04:55.660 --> 04:58.250
Nah.

05:00.750 --> 05:02.250
It was incredible.

05:02.750 --> 05:03.750
That's Fonzie's
water.

05:05.250 --> 05:07.260
I was passing by the garage
when I smelled smoke.

05:07.260 --> 05:08.760
Then I heard screams.

05:08.760 --> 05:09.760
Aaayyh, aaayyh, aaayyh,
aaayyh, aaayyh, aaayyh.

05:10.260 --> 05:11.230
Oh, maybe not screams.

05:18.740 --> 05:20.740
Anyway, I ran inside,

05:20.740 --> 05:22.610
and I dragged
the Fonz out.

05:22.860 --> 05:24.440
Potsie,
you're a hero!

05:24.440 --> 05:25.940
(cheering and laughter)
Yeah?

05:26.440 --> 05:27.440
All right,
all right, ho!

05:27.440 --> 05:29.450
Just step back, girls,
step back.

05:31.000 --> 05:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:40.670 --> 05:41.670
Oh, Fonz.

05:42.180 --> 05:43.680
I'm the Italian;
I'll do the hugging.

05:45.180 --> 05:46.680
Unbelievable, Potsie,

05:47.180 --> 05:48.680
you did good.

05:49.180 --> 05:51.180
Any favor you want,
you got.

05:51.180 --> 05:53.050
(crowd murmuring)

05:53.350 --> 05:56.440
Now go wash up-- you look
like Smokey the Bear.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.220
Thanks, Fonz.
Yeah.

05:58.470 --> 06:00.360
Give him some air,
give him some air, come on.

06:00.560 --> 06:01.640
I'll tell you something,

06:02.150 --> 06:04.480
if it wasn't for him,
I'd look like Ralph's car.

06:04.780 --> 06:06.370
(chuckles)

06:09.370 --> 06:11.370
You mean he left my car
in the garage?

06:11.370 --> 06:12.370
He went off
without it?

06:12.870 --> 06:13.870
Well, maybe he didn't
have time.

06:13.870 --> 06:15.240
He had time
to pull him out!

06:15.490 --> 06:16.410
Aaayyh.

06:16.660 --> 06:17.740
Sorry, Fonz.

06:17.740 --> 06:19.250
Oh, no, my car!

06:19.660 --> 06:21.250
(piano playing)

06:21.750 --> 06:24.750
HOWARD:
<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">It's time to go to the Open
House at school, Marion{\r}.</font></font></i>

06:24.750 --> 06:26.720
MARION:
<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">We're just about through
with Vickie's piano lesson{\r}.</font></font></i>

06:27.090 --> 06:28.670
Can I be finished now?

06:29.170 --> 06:31.090
Yes, Vickie, you
can be finished.

06:31.420 --> 06:33.510
Joanie, dear, will you get
Vickie's coat?

06:35.510 --> 06:37.510
There you go, dear.

06:37.510 --> 06:39.020
Howard...
Mmm?

06:39.020 --> 06:41.520
Remember when the children
were small?

06:41.520 --> 06:42.350
Yeah.

06:42.600 --> 06:44.690
Oh, I wish that
we had a little one

06:44.690 --> 06:47.070
around here sometimes.

06:50.440 --> 06:52.030
Well, we got ten
minutes, Marion.

06:56.530 --> 06:59.370
Howard, just put
your coat on.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.700
Oh, Dad, has Potsie
showed up here yet?

07:01.700 --> 07:03.210
Why would Potsie
come over here?

07:03.710 --> 07:04.710
We've already
had dinner.

07:05.210 --> 07:06.710
No, no, it's not
for dinner.

07:07.210 --> 07:08.710
See, uh,

07:08.710 --> 07:10.710
Fonzie feels that since
Potsie saved his life

07:10.710 --> 07:12.220
that he owes him a favor.

07:12.220 --> 07:13.720
Yeah, it's called
the Fonzarelli code.

07:13.720 --> 07:15.720
A man saves your life,

07:15.720 --> 07:18.720
any favor he asks,
you gotta answer it.

07:18.720 --> 07:20.720
You know?
I mean like in-in Sicily?

07:20.720 --> 07:23.560
Uncle Vito, he had his life
saved by a midget.

07:23.780 --> 07:25.360
A midget?
FONZIE:
Yeah.

07:25.360 --> 07:27.360
What did he ask for?

07:27.360 --> 07:28.650
Height!

07:29.900 --> 07:31.400
Well, in a way,
you know, in a way.

07:31.900 --> 07:33.400
Every time there was
a parade in town,

07:33.400 --> 07:34.400
Uncle Vito had
to take that midget,

07:34.400 --> 07:35.910
put him on his shoulders
so he could see.

07:36.410 --> 07:37.410
That's right,

07:37.410 --> 07:39.790
I-I was told it was
a very moving experience.

07:40.040 --> 07:41.630
You know, speaking
of moving,

07:41.630 --> 07:43.410
Ginny Picalow's project is
waiting.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.210
Yes, dear,

07:45.210 --> 07:47.630
we will make it to the
Open House on time.

07:47.970 --> 07:49.550
What's your project,
Joanie?

07:50.000 --> 07:51.050
Oh, I wrote a
composition,

07:51.470 --> 07:53.890
"My Parents are Still Frisky."

07:56.260 --> 07:57.760
Howard,

07:58.260 --> 07:59.760
she-she wouldn't.

08:00.260 --> 08:01.760
Well, who knows,
Marion?

08:01.760 --> 08:03.270
What will we do
if she reads it

08:03.270 --> 08:05.770
in front of the whole
auditorium?

08:05.770 --> 08:07.770
We'll move.
Good.

08:07.770 --> 08:09.160
(doorbell rings)

08:09.520 --> 08:10.610
Oh, I bet that's
Potsie.

08:11.110 --> 08:12.830
What do you think he's gonna ask
for, Fonz?
Well,

08:13.080 --> 08:15.410
what do you think goes with his
Huckleberry Hound lunch box?

08:17.660 --> 08:18.700
Hey, Rich.
Oh, come on in,
guys.

08:18.700 --> 08:20.200
Yeah.
Thanks, Richie.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.200
Hey, Fonz.
Hey.
Hi, Fonz.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.200
What are you
doing here?

08:22.200 --> 08:24.200
My car's all burned up,
remember?

08:24.200 --> 08:26.010
Potsie's giving me
a ride home.

08:26.210 --> 08:27.290
Yeah, it's hard,

08:27.290 --> 08:28.760
he keeps getting his feet stuck
in the spokes.

08:29.180 --> 08:31.260
Well, if you didn't have
your sister's bike,

08:31.760 --> 08:33.100
I wouldn't have to ride
on the handlebars.

08:33.299 --> 08:34.380
Oh, you're lucky
you got a ride at all.

08:34.799 --> 08:36.380
All right, all right, here,
time out here, time out,

08:36.380 --> 08:37.880
we're not here to bicker
about bicycles.

08:37.880 --> 08:39.890
You had a whole day
to think about it,

08:39.890 --> 08:41.220
now what do you want, Potsie?

08:41.470 --> 08:42.559
All right, now anything
you want, Potsie,

08:42.559 --> 08:44.560
anything at all, Fonzie
will give it to you,

08:44.560 --> 08:46.360
you just tell him
what you want.
Uh, Cunningham?

08:46.560 --> 08:47.640
Let us not push the kid.

08:47.640 --> 08:49.650
Oh.
What do you want now?

08:49.650 --> 08:50.950
A new thermos
for your lunch box?

08:51.150 --> 08:53.230
Or, uh, uh, uh,

08:53.230 --> 08:54.730
a new-- a new bell
for your bike?

08:55.230 --> 08:56.700
A date with the Aloha
Pussycats?

08:57.240 --> 08:58.240
Can be arranged.
Take 'em!

08:58.240 --> 08:59.740
Take the Pussycats!

08:59.740 --> 09:00.740
No.

09:01.240 --> 09:02.240
No, I don't think
I want that.

09:02.240 --> 09:04.240
But, can I sit down
for a minute, Fonz?

09:04.240 --> 09:05.750
Yeah, sure.
Aw, thanks.

09:05.750 --> 09:06.580
Uh...

09:06.880 --> 09:08.970
I've given thought

09:09.470 --> 09:10.970
to different
things, Fonz.

09:10.970 --> 09:13.300
And, uh, well, I picked
something that means
a lot to me.

09:13.590 --> 09:15.170
Shoot.

09:15.170 --> 09:16.060
Yeah.

09:17.420 --> 09:19.260
I want to pal around
with you, Fonz.

09:28.070 --> 09:30.020
You want to, uh,
pal around?

09:30.020 --> 09:32.070
Yeah.
With me?

09:32.440 --> 09:34.020
Yeah.

09:34.520 --> 09:36.030
You and I together,
all the time.

09:36.530 --> 09:38.030
Just like this...

09:38.530 --> 09:40.450
pal.

Pals, huh?

09:54.930 --> 09:55.930
Potsie-- pals.

09:55.930 --> 09:56.930
Look, we are pals.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.430
Don't you want something
more exciting?

09:58.430 --> 09:59.930
How about a, uh,
a piano!

10:00.430 --> 10:01.430
Oh, uh,

10:01.430 --> 10:02.440
no, Fonz.

10:02.440 --> 10:03.890
I want to be
your special pal.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.720
Why?

10:07.060 --> 10:09.060
Well, I never had a sp--

10:09.560 --> 10:11.060
well, kids do things
with their fathers, right?

10:11.560 --> 10:13.400
Ralph and his dad go fishing
together.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.280
Oh yeah, he puts
worms in my shoes

10:15.280 --> 10:16.780
and I put minnows
down his back.

10:16.780 --> 10:17.730
It's great,
he loves it.

10:18.120 --> 10:19.150
Yeah!

10:19.570 --> 10:21.150
I know what I'm gonna do,

10:21.150 --> 10:22.660
I'm gonna get you
a fishing pole

10:22.660 --> 10:23.990
and a can of
worms, huh?

10:24.210 --> 10:25.790
Aw, Rich and his dad
are so close

10:25.790 --> 10:27.580
he even told him
about sex.

10:27.830 --> 10:30.410
Yeah, but he got most
of it wrong, anyway.

10:33.050 --> 10:35.550
Look, uh, Potsie,
look, uh,

10:35.550 --> 10:37.550
you know being pals, that's
a-- that's a cute idea...

10:37.550 --> 10:38.550
I knew you'd like it,
Fonz!

10:38.550 --> 10:40.060
I'll give you
my phone number.

10:40.060 --> 10:42.560
We'll do everything
I never got to do
with my father.

10:42.560 --> 10:44.390
I think I just adopted Potsie.

10:45.850 --> 10:47.350
Yeah, well,
I-I don't think

10:47.350 --> 10:49.350
he means he wants to spend
every minute with you.

10:49.350 --> 10:52.230
Oh, no, Fonz, he only
means about three or
four times a week,

10:52.570 --> 10:54.150
right, Pots?
Oh, yeah.

10:54.150 --> 10:56.160
Here, Fonz, you need
some time to yourself.

10:56.160 --> 10:57.160
Aaayyh.

10:57.160 --> 10:59.160
Whoa.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.160
Oh, I got a great idea
for Tuesday night.

11:03.160 --> 11:04.660
Oh, yeah?

11:04.660 --> 11:06.170
Where are the pals going?
The circus?

11:06.670 --> 11:09.170
(humming circus theme)

11:09.170 --> 11:12.120
How would you like to
be a fist swallower?

11:14.340 --> 11:16.930
Nah, Ralph, the circus
isn't until Thursday.

11:17.430 --> 11:18.930
Tuesday, we can go
to the bumper cars.

11:18.930 --> 11:20.710
Bumper cars!
Yeah.

11:22.010 --> 11:23.800
Sounds like big
fun, Fonz.

11:23.970 --> 11:25.550
Oh, hey, Fonz,
I know it sounds silly,

11:26.050 --> 11:26.890
but I never did it.

11:27.190 --> 11:28.770
All right, all right,
we'll do it.

11:28.770 --> 11:30.270
We'll do it.
Oh, great!

11:30.270 --> 11:31.270
Ooh, hey!

11:31.270 --> 11:32.730
Next week, we can go
roller-skating.

11:33.110 --> 11:34.190
Oh, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

11:34.190 --> 11:36.200
Forget it,
I don't skate.

11:36.200 --> 11:37.560
I'll teach you.

11:37.860 --> 11:38.900
Hey, don't--

11:38.900 --> 11:39.950
Come on, don't you
want a date

11:40.450 --> 11:42.230
with the Aloha
Pussycats?

11:42.490 --> 11:43.570
Oh, yeah.

11:44.070 --> 11:45.570
Bring them along, too.

11:46.070 --> 11:47.070
I'll teach them.

11:47.070 --> 11:49.040
See you, buddies.

11:49.040 --> 11:51.080
So long, pal.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.920
There is nothing
he can teach them.

12:00.250 --> 12:02.090
Hey, Fonz, are you
afraid to skate?

12:02.300 --> 12:03.390
Afraid?

12:03.390 --> 12:05.390
If the man upstairs
wanted us to skate,

12:05.390 --> 12:07.390
we would be born with little
wheels on our feet.

Fonz, I can't believe you
didn't skate as a child.

I was never a child.

grown-ups do.

I'm gonna get you
set up for tonight, pal.

yesterday.

I didn't mean it.

other side of the rink.

what's the matter?

First of all, I ain't a mister,

how to skate.

Fonz, why don't you just
break the Fonzarelli Code?

19:14.490 --> 19:16.520
Yeah, it's not
just the code, Red.

19:16.520 --> 19:18.070

You know, I mean,
I like him.

to pick something else?

19:28.330 --> 19:30.250
Maybe he'll choose
the Aloha Pussycats.

19:30.590 --> 19:32.540
Yeah, and maybe he'll
choose to be my roomie.

19:33.960 --> 19:36.930
I got to face it, I got to help
him relive his childhood.

19:36.930 --> 19:40.460
It's just a wonderful life
of circuses and bumper cars.

19:43.470 --> 19:44.970
Well, it's not too bad, Fonz.

19:44.970 --> 19:46.770
The rodeo is coming
to town next week.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.100
Roy Rogers!

19:49.100 --> 19:50.610
Trigger does tricks.

19:50.610 --> 19:51.440
He knows how to count.

19:55.780 --> 19:57.280
Cunningham...

19:57.280 --> 19:59.780
Right, sorry, Fonz.

19:59.780 --> 20:01.780
I heard Trigger also
knows how to multiply.

20:01.780 --> 20:03.240
Get out of here!

20:06.740 --> 20:09.580
I ask him for advice...
he counts like a horse.

20:27.480 --> 20:28.260
You...?

20:28.510 --> 20:29.510
You... wait.

20:32.100 --> 20:34.180
I-I just came
to get the...

20:46.280 --> 20:47.610
Hey, Fonz.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
My pal's here,
I got... split.

20:52.500 --> 20:54.290
How you doing, Pots?
Where you been?

20:54.500 --> 20:56.460
Oh, you know, Fonz,
I've been around.

20:56.790 --> 20:57.870
Yeah, what festivities
you got planned

20:58.370 --> 21:00.180
for me tonight,
a little skeet ball?

21:00.380 --> 21:01.960
Oh, no, nothing like that.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.460
No, but...

21:03.460 --> 21:05.460
can I sit down and talk
to you for a second?

21:05.850 --> 21:06.770
Sit down, shoot.

21:07.020 --> 21:08.100
Thanks.

21:08.100 --> 21:11.100
Uh...

21:11.100 --> 21:13.610
I just want you
to know that, uh,

21:13.610 --> 21:15.610
I really appreciate you
letting me hang around.

21:15.610 --> 21:18.110
I mean, I never never
had a big brother

21:18.110 --> 21:18.980
or anything like that.

21:19.310 --> 21:20.810
Hey, Pots...
It's really...

21:20.810 --> 21:21.810
you saved my life.

21:22.200 --> 21:25.280
Yeah, I saved your life.

21:25.280 --> 21:28.290
Oh, hey, I-I really
had a great time at the circus.

21:28.790 --> 21:30.290
I framed that picture of you
with the balloon.

21:30.710 --> 21:32.290
Yeah, hey, uh, do me
a favor on that one, will you?

21:32.290 --> 21:33.290
Hang that one in the closet.

21:34.790 --> 21:37.300
I understand, sure.

21:37.300 --> 21:42.300
I mean... we really had
a lot of fun together.

21:42.800 --> 21:46.310
That's why it's really hard
to tell you that, uh...

21:46.310 --> 21:48.670
we just can't hang around
together anymore.

21:51.890 --> 21:52.890
We can't?

21:53.310 --> 21:55.400
No, uh...

21:55.900 --> 21:58.730
you see, Fonz, I need my room.

21:58.980 --> 22:03.570
Hey, now, that's funny,
because I just, uh...

22:03.570 --> 22:04.940
yeah, I was just saying that.

22:05.240 --> 22:06.690
Yeah, so you know what I mean.

22:06.990 --> 22:07.940
I sure do.

22:08.240 --> 22:10.200
And we can still
be friends, right?

22:10.500 --> 22:12.360
I mean...

22:12.610 --> 22:15.620
I figure... you'd do the same
for me in a fire.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.870
Hey, you got it, Pots.

22:18.120 --> 22:20.210
I got it.

22:20.210 --> 22:22.710
So, Fonz, uh...

22:25.210 --> 22:26.510
you don't owe me
anything anymore.

22:31.050 --> 22:33.140
Hey, my date's here.

22:51.400 --> 22:52.290
Pots?

22:53.910 --> 22:55.320
You're all right.

22:55.570 --> 22:57.080
Thanks, Rich.

22:57.380 --> 23:00.960
I was supposed to have a date
with Isabell Polinka tonight,

23:00.960 --> 23:02.960
but she's home sewing her seam.

23:06.800 --> 23:08.300
Would you like going down
to the gym

23:08.300 --> 23:09.810
and playing some basketball?

23:09.810 --> 23:11.310
I'm trying to work
on my left hand dribble.

23:11.720 --> 23:14.260
(muttering):
No, that's okay.

23:14.640 --> 23:16.730
I'll introduce you
to some of my friends.

23:19.230 --> 23:20.730
Hey, Fonz.

23:21.230 --> 23:23.070
Looks like you're gonna
have a hot time tonight.

23:23.270 --> 23:24.850
What are you talking about, me?

23:24.850 --> 23:27.360
Me and Pots are going
to have a hot time tonight,

23:27.360 --> 23:29.240
if you got one more "pal night"
left inside you.

23:32.110 --> 23:33.110
All right, Fonz!

23:33.110 --> 23:34.610
FONZIE:
All right.

23:34.610 --> 23:36.000
Oh... three for me
and three for you?

23:36.330 --> 23:37.330
Well, don't get excited,
you know?

23:37.670 --> 23:39.250
Oh.

23:41.750 --> 23:42.670
Four and two?

23:43.000 --> 23:43.920
Hey.

23:44.120 --> 23:45.670
Hey, Fonz, can I have
the one on the left?

23:46.090 --> 23:47.680
Yeah... my left.

23:47.680 --> 23:49.180
Right, right.

23:50.600 --> 23:52.010
FONZIE:
All right,

23:52.260 --> 23:54.770
let's go trip the light
fantastic.

23:55.050 --> 23:56.130
