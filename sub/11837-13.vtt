WEBVTT

00:03.136 --> 00:06.139
(vomiting)

00:10.443 --> 00:11.945
(sobs)

00:15.616 --> 00:18.351
(breathing heavily)

00:20.854 --> 00:23.857
(music playing)

00:29.596 --> 00:30.396
MAN (over TV):
The liberal media

00:30.430 --> 00:31.532
hates traditional pro-God,

00:31.565 --> 00:32.265
pro-country,
pro-family values--

00:32.298 --> 00:33.433
PAUL: God...

00:33.466 --> 00:34.300
MAN (over TV):
--because, frankly,

00:34.334 --> 00:35.268
they don't believe in them.

00:35.301 --> 00:36.436
<i>MAN (over TV):</i>
<i>That's not true. Hold on.</i>

00:36.469 --> 00:37.470
MAN (over TV): It is true.

00:37.504 --> 00:38.705
And it's why
liberal media types,

00:38.739 --> 00:40.273
especially in New York City
and Hollywood,

00:40.306 --> 00:42.909
hate the US military,
hate the president,

00:42.943 --> 00:45.178
and, frankly,
hate me and guys like me.

00:45.211 --> 00:46.813
Look what
they've done to Rush.

00:46.847 --> 00:48.314
MAN (over TV): Nobody hates
the US military, I'm just...

00:48.348 --> 00:50.150
MAN (over TV): Bottom line
is liberals in this country

00:50.183 --> 00:53.620
want to pursue their big
government socialist policies,

00:53.654 --> 00:55.388
they hate any free enterprise,
they hate capitalism,

00:55.421 --> 00:57.858
and they hate...

00:59.660 --> 01:02.503
(music playing)

01:05.906 --> 01:09.008
(engine revving)

01:09.042 --> 01:11.077
(tires screeching)

01:30.130 --> 01:33.133
(music playing)

02:13.479 --> 02:14.548
A retreat?

02:14.581 --> 02:16.617
SHORE: Yes, a company outing

02:16.650 --> 02:19.318
where we all get to know
our inner selves.

02:20.086 --> 02:22.022
Do people ever get
to your core, Jimmy,

02:22.055 --> 02:23.924
or do they stop short
at the mantle?

02:23.957 --> 02:24.925
Did you hear that?

02:24.958 --> 02:25.959
Fat joke.

02:25.992 --> 02:27.594
SHORE: I'm actually being
quite serious here.

02:27.628 --> 02:29.930
We all work too hard.
WILSON: Young, Frutt, Berluti.

02:29.963 --> 02:30.997
How about Tahiti?

02:31.031 --> 02:33.399
WILSON: Alan,
Paul Stewart.

02:33.433 --> 02:34.701
He says
it's an emergency.

02:38.004 --> 02:38.772
Paul?

02:38.805 --> 02:39.506
PAUL (over phone): Alan,

02:40.406 --> 02:41.975
I need you to get down
to my office now.

02:42.008 --> 02:43.343
Did I miss a check-up?

02:43.376 --> 02:44.878
I've got an emergency.

02:44.911 --> 02:46.446
I have detectives
in my waiting room.

02:46.479 --> 02:47.581
I need you to get down here.

02:47.614 --> 02:49.182
You need to come
through my private entrance

02:49.215 --> 02:50.150
so they don't see you.

02:51.251 --> 02:52.819
Hurry, Alan.

02:53.654 --> 02:55.121
I'm in trouble.

03:00.233 --> 03:01.802
(elevator bell dings)

03:04.738 --> 03:07.741
(music playing)

03:12.378 --> 03:13.514
(knocks on door)

03:13.547 --> 03:14.314
Alan.

03:14.347 --> 03:15.516
What is going on?

03:15.549 --> 03:17.417
Come in, please.

03:19.720 --> 03:21.087
They're still
waiting out there.

03:21.121 --> 03:22.322
In a second, Cheryl.
They're about to just--

03:22.355 --> 03:23.256
I'll be out in a second.

03:23.289 --> 03:24.958
Just tell them
I'm finishing a procedure.

03:27.561 --> 03:30.163
Listen, I've been having
an affair.

03:32.032 --> 03:33.700
Brenda Wilbur,
who I believe you know.

03:33.734 --> 03:35.168
Brenda Wilbur.
PAUL: Ah, yes.

03:35.201 --> 03:36.369
I've been wanting to have
an affair with Brenda Wilbur.

03:36.402 --> 03:37.671
PAUL: Can you shut up?

03:37.704 --> 03:39.773
Can you just shut up, please?

03:39.806 --> 03:41.307
She's dead.

03:42.543 --> 03:43.877
What?
Somebody bludgeoned her

03:43.910 --> 03:45.311
or something.
I saw the body.

03:45.345 --> 03:46.379
I was there last night.

03:46.412 --> 03:47.681
I walked in--
Whoa, wait. Slow down.

03:47.714 --> 03:49.049
PAUL: I can't slow down.
The police are out there.

03:49.082 --> 03:50.483
I was there,
I had made love to her earlier,

03:50.517 --> 03:52.152
and now they're here
to ask me questions.

03:52.185 --> 03:52.853
Okay.

03:52.886 --> 03:54.120
Do I talk to the police now?

03:54.154 --> 03:55.088
Do I tell them I was there?

03:55.121 --> 03:56.289
What should I do?

03:56.322 --> 03:57.090
They're coming.

03:57.123 --> 03:58.224
PAUL: Just get out.

03:59.259 --> 04:00.601
(door closes)

04:01.602 --> 04:02.969
What do I do?

04:03.003 --> 04:04.771
It's gonna look suspicious
if I have a lawyer.

04:04.805 --> 04:07.574
How do I even explain you
being here?

04:07.608 --> 04:08.809
CHERYL: He said
he'd be right out.

04:08.842 --> 04:09.710
He's in a procedure!
We've been here an hour.

04:09.743 --> 04:10.811
We don't have time for this.

04:10.844 --> 04:12.478
So you keep saying.

04:12.513 --> 04:13.847
I'm sorry, doctor,
but this is urgent.

04:13.880 --> 04:15.582
PAUL: Would you give me
10 more seconds, for God's sake?

04:15.616 --> 04:17.117
This patient could sue me.

04:17.149 --> 04:18.584
He's a lawyer.

04:18.619 --> 04:20.086
Do you know a Ms. Brenda Wilbur?

04:20.120 --> 04:21.321
PAUL: Why?

04:21.353 --> 04:22.556
This needs to be
a private conversation, doctor.

04:22.589 --> 04:25.058
PAUL: You need to go back
out there and wait.

04:27.027 --> 04:27.928
What about Brenda?

04:28.929 --> 04:29.996
She's dead.

04:31.397 --> 04:33.833
Do you know her?

04:37.103 --> 04:38.538
What do you mean she's dead?

04:38.572 --> 04:39.806
She was killed.

04:41.508 --> 04:43.810
Look, we really need to have
this discussion in private.

04:43.844 --> 04:45.579
I need to ask you some things.

04:45.612 --> 04:47.280
Hold on.

04:48.982 --> 04:50.651
(spits) Sorry,

04:50.684 --> 04:52.719
but as a lawyer,
I get suspicious

04:52.753 --> 04:54.320
when detectives barge
in asking questions

04:54.354 --> 04:55.589
about dead people.

04:55.622 --> 04:57.090
This doesn't involve you, sir.

04:57.123 --> 04:57.991
Actually, it involves me more

04:58.024 --> 04:58.959
than you could ever imagine.

04:58.992 --> 05:00.400
I'm not only this man's friend,

05:00.433 --> 05:01.768
I was a friend
of Brenda Wilbur's.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.236
How did she die?

05:03.269 --> 05:04.738
Head trauma.

05:04.771 --> 05:07.140
Your car was seen parked outside
her place yesterday afternoon.

05:07.173 --> 05:08.174
SHORE: Wait a second.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.177
Are you questioning this man
as if he were a suspect?

05:11.211 --> 05:12.613
Certainly not. We j--

05:12.646 --> 05:13.479
SHORE: Paul,
when a detective says,

05:13.514 --> 05:14.147
"Certainly not,"
you can be certain--

05:14.180 --> 05:15.148
MAN: Sir--

05:15.181 --> 05:16.583
It's Alan Shore.

05:17.083 --> 05:19.019
I'm sure my client
would love to cooperate,

05:19.052 --> 05:20.453
but not before
I get a little more information.

05:20.486 --> 05:21.454
I don't mind talking, Alan.

05:21.487 --> 05:23.489
But I do mind, Paul.

05:24.490 --> 05:26.426
I know you have
his best interests at heart.

05:26.459 --> 05:28.094
Just the same--
Mr. Shore--

05:28.128 --> 05:29.663
He's not talking.

05:30.997 --> 05:33.266
Perhaps you'd like to.
You've said nothing so far.

05:34.367 --> 05:35.636
I think he did it.

05:35.669 --> 05:38.705
Look, counselor,
this is how it's gonna go.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.373
He's either gonna
talk to us here,

05:40.406 --> 05:41.875
or we're gonna take him
into custody

05:41.908 --> 05:43.644
and walk him right out
that front door.

05:44.310 --> 05:45.679
This is a small town.

05:45.712 --> 05:48.649
This man's family has quite
a legacy in this small town.

05:49.049 --> 05:51.284
I don't think
he wants to be seen handcuffed

05:51.317 --> 05:52.619
in connection
to the murder of a woman

05:52.653 --> 05:54.788
that he had a mysterious
relationship with.

05:54.821 --> 05:56.456
Do you?

05:56.489 --> 05:57.924
My God, You're Kevin McCarley.

05:59.025 --> 05:59.860
Alan Shore.

05:59.893 --> 06:02.035
We went
to middle school together.

06:02.068 --> 06:03.303
How are you?
Look at you.

06:03.336 --> 06:04.237
Wow.

06:04.270 --> 06:05.271
You're still the same

06:05.305 --> 06:06.773
pain in the ass
you were then.

06:08.542 --> 06:09.309
Take him.

06:10.577 --> 06:11.377
Alan.

06:11.411 --> 06:12.178
SHORE: Just a second.

06:14.515 --> 06:15.849
Let me tell them
what I know.

06:15.882 --> 06:16.750
Terrible idea.

06:16.783 --> 06:18.184
We don't know what he knows.

06:18.218 --> 06:20.053
He is going to arrest me.

06:20.086 --> 06:21.187
SHORE: Look at me.

06:21.221 --> 06:24.390
First of all, try not to look
so much like a suspect.

06:24.424 --> 06:27.093
Can you put something other
than panic on your face?

06:28.261 --> 06:31.031
You were having an affair
with the victim.

06:31.064 --> 06:33.099
You were witnessed
at the scene.

06:33.133 --> 06:35.702
Dodging arrest
isn't the goal here.

06:35.736 --> 06:37.771
It's about preventing
a conviction.

06:38.505 --> 06:40.006
A conviction?

06:40.040 --> 06:42.876
You cannot give
any statement to the police.

06:42.909 --> 06:44.745
There's a reason
for that little jingle,

06:44.778 --> 06:47.213
"What you say can and will
be used against you."

06:47.681 --> 06:49.149
What about Wendy?
What about the kids?

06:49.182 --> 06:50.416
SHORE: I'll go talk to them.

06:50.450 --> 06:52.786
In the meantime,
you talk to nobody.

06:53.954 --> 06:55.656
I cannot believe
this is happening to me.

06:55.689 --> 06:57.824
McCARLEY: Look, if I have to
arrest him right here, I will.

06:57.858 --> 07:00.060
Shouldn't you first do
that other thing that police do?

07:00.093 --> 07:00.934
What's the word?

07:00.967 --> 07:01.935
Investigate.

07:03.036 --> 07:04.805
Maybe I should bring you
in on aiding and abetting.

07:04.838 --> 07:06.006
SHORE: Kevin, it's me, Alan.

07:06.039 --> 07:07.407
We played
on the same soccer team.

07:07.440 --> 07:08.775
We've showered together.

07:09.610 --> 07:11.645
You had
a very small penis then.

07:11.678 --> 07:12.746
Has it--

07:12.779 --> 07:13.747
Take him.

07:13.780 --> 07:15.248
Say nothing.

07:17.518 --> 07:18.685
Let's go.

07:21.622 --> 07:23.924
Do we Mirandize here, Kev,
or is that not done in Dedham?

07:29.763 --> 07:30.864
They took him into custody.

07:30.897 --> 07:32.432
They didn't make
an actual arrest.

07:32.465 --> 07:33.634
Do they plan to?

07:33.667 --> 07:34.568
SHORE (over phone):
I don't know.

07:34.601 --> 07:36.637
It may just be
about coercing a statement.

07:36.670 --> 07:37.904
Where are you now?

07:37.938 --> 07:38.672
SHORE (over phone):
At the scene.

07:38.705 --> 07:39.439
I figure I'll just try

07:39.472 --> 07:41.975
and see whatever I can.

07:42.008 --> 07:43.409
All right.

07:53.186 --> 07:54.454
You again?

07:54.487 --> 07:55.656
What are you doing here?

07:55.689 --> 07:56.990
I thought you were
with my client.

07:57.023 --> 07:59.459
We're giving him time
to think about cooperating.

07:59.492 --> 08:01.835
I'm happy to advise him
to cooperate.

08:01.868 --> 08:04.237
But I got to have some idea
what we're dealing with here.

08:04.270 --> 08:05.639
I'd like to view the scene.

08:06.172 --> 08:07.207
View the scene?

08:07.240 --> 08:08.308
Why not?

08:08.341 --> 08:10.343
McCARLEY: Because we don't give
tours to civilians.

08:10.376 --> 08:11.444
SHORE: I'm not gonna contaminate
the crime scene.

08:11.477 --> 08:12.713
McCARLEY: We haven't even
positively ID'd her yet.

08:12.746 --> 08:14.180
SHORE: You want my guy
to cooperate.

08:14.214 --> 08:15.181
I can ID her.

08:15.215 --> 08:16.349
As I told you,
I knew Brenda Wilbur.

08:16.382 --> 08:18.318
McCARLEY: She's been ID'd.

08:18.351 --> 08:21.354
Oh. Listen, you wanna talk to
Paul Stewart.

08:21.387 --> 08:24.124
I wanna let him talk to you.

08:24.157 --> 08:25.659
Let me just get a glimpse

08:25.692 --> 08:27.093
of what we're dealing
with here first.

08:27.127 --> 08:29.295
Help me help you.

08:30.396 --> 08:31.632
You don't want me
saying in court

08:31.665 --> 08:33.433
you refused to let me see
the crime scene.

08:37.804 --> 08:38.539
(camera flashes)

08:38.572 --> 08:40.741
MAN: Yeah, the room is covered.

08:40.774 --> 08:41.575
Right.

08:41.607 --> 08:42.775
You got...

09:04.605 --> 09:08.341
She, uh...

09:08.374 --> 09:10.210
Was found like that?

09:10.777 --> 09:11.812
Yes.

09:17.984 --> 09:20.921
I, uh, knew this woman.

09:25.391 --> 09:26.660
You okay?

09:27.293 --> 09:28.929
Uh, yeah.

09:31.331 --> 09:32.633
For God's sake.
Get him off.

09:32.666 --> 09:34.234
Get him off!

09:34.267 --> 09:35.602
MAN: Pick him up.

09:40.406 --> 09:41.107
You fainted?

09:41.141 --> 09:42.609
SHORE: Shh. No.

09:42.643 --> 09:45.011
Please, don't make fun of me,
Eugene.

09:45.045 --> 09:46.880
I wasn't prepared
for what I saw.

09:46.913 --> 09:48.114
Right on the dead body?

09:48.148 --> 09:51.051
I'm asking you for advice,
not ridicule.

09:51.084 --> 09:53.053
Do I let the man speak or not?

09:53.086 --> 09:54.287
Not if he's the suspect.

09:54.320 --> 09:55.355
But assuming he's innocent--

09:55.388 --> 09:56.823
YOUNG: We never assume.

09:56.857 --> 09:57.758
SHORE: I've known him
since childhood.

09:57.791 --> 09:58.892
He's--

09:58.925 --> 10:01.234
It's the childhood friends
you can never trust.

10:01.267 --> 10:03.036
VICTORIA: Alan.

10:03.069 --> 10:03.970
SHORE: Victoria.

10:04.004 --> 10:06.139
VICTORIA: What's being done?

10:06.172 --> 10:07.440
Victoria,
this is Eugene Young.

10:07.473 --> 10:08.208
Hello.

10:08.241 --> 10:09.610
What's being done?

10:09.643 --> 10:11.244
SHORE: At this point, there's--

10:11.277 --> 10:12.846
Is there a place for privacy?

10:13.947 --> 10:15.048
Yes.

10:15.081 --> 10:16.817
Excuse us.

10:22.088 --> 10:24.257
There's been no arrest yet.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.259
They can place him at the scene

10:26.292 --> 10:28.361
several hours before.

10:29.262 --> 10:33.133
I'm assuming
they can establish--

10:33.166 --> 10:34.434
The affair?

10:35.836 --> 10:37.437
Paul told me about it.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.439
Really?

10:39.472 --> 10:42.108
I would think his mother
would be the last person

10:42.142 --> 10:44.044
he'd want--

10:45.912 --> 10:47.781
what else has he told you?

10:55.722 --> 10:57.524
You were extorted
by the victim?

10:59.392 --> 11:00.534
Paul, if I'm gonna help you,

11:00.567 --> 11:02.135
you need to share with me
at least as much

11:02.168 --> 11:03.303
as you tell your mother.

11:07.307 --> 11:10.310
Brenda contacted
a lawyer who--

11:10.343 --> 11:11.645
Tried to shake you down?

11:11.678 --> 11:13.346
PAUL: It was veiled.

11:13.980 --> 11:15.315
I confronted her over it.

11:15.348 --> 11:18.819
She apologized,
admitted it was a stupid idea.

11:18.852 --> 11:19.853
It was no longer an issue.

11:19.886 --> 11:21.121
SHORE: No longer an issue?

11:21.154 --> 11:22.222
It transpired a week

11:22.255 --> 11:24.190
before her head
was pounded to mulch.

11:24.224 --> 11:26.259
It wasn't
a coercive quid pro quo.

11:26.292 --> 11:27.961
But you perceived
it as extortion,

11:27.994 --> 11:30.396
and she's currently dead.

11:32.498 --> 11:34.000
(sighs)

11:34.034 --> 11:35.602
SHORE: Okay.

11:36.703 --> 11:38.705
Attorneys are divided

11:38.739 --> 11:40.507
over whether
this next question

11:40.541 --> 11:42.709
should ever be posed
to a client.

11:43.409 --> 11:46.479
But as a childhood friend
who grew up with you,

11:48.281 --> 11:50.751
did you commit this crime?

11:52.753 --> 11:56.422
For a childhood friend
to have to ask me,

11:59.593 --> 12:01.334
the answer is no,

12:01.367 --> 12:03.504
I did not.

12:09.242 --> 12:10.210
CATHERINE: Hello.

12:10.243 --> 12:11.044
SHORE: Hello.

12:11.077 --> 12:12.345
CATHERINE: Are you his lawyer?

12:12.713 --> 12:13.647
Sorry?

12:13.680 --> 12:15.716
Paul Stewart,
are you his lawyer?

12:15.749 --> 12:18.251
Mrs. Piper,
Alan Shore.

12:18.284 --> 12:19.886
I grew up here in Dedham

12:19.920 --> 12:21.187
just three streets
over from you.

12:21.221 --> 12:22.823
Well, you used
to trick-or-treat at my house.

12:22.856 --> 12:24.224
SHORE: Yes.

12:24.257 --> 12:25.091
Hello.

12:25.125 --> 12:25.926
Hello!

12:25.959 --> 12:27.060
Aah.

12:28.228 --> 12:29.062
Ugh!

12:29.095 --> 12:32.365
You once lit a paper bag
on my porch.

12:32.398 --> 12:33.734
It was full of dog crap.

12:33.767 --> 12:36.069
I stomped it out

12:36.102 --> 12:38.438
and got stool
on my fleece slippers.

12:38.471 --> 12:39.640
It never came out.

12:42.576 --> 12:43.944
You were a crazy old bitch then.

12:43.977 --> 12:46.547
I can see nobody's
adjusted your medication.

12:46.580 --> 12:48.248
Funny you should mention that.

12:48.281 --> 12:51.652
This new Medicare package
is gonna strap me.

12:51.685 --> 12:53.253
I need money, Alan.

12:53.286 --> 12:56.189
So much so I sometimes see it
in my dreams.

12:56.222 --> 12:59.626
In fact, I see it
almost everywhere.

12:59.660 --> 13:02.435
I especially saw it
at 10:30 last night

13:02.468 --> 13:05.438
when I saw Paul Stewart
coming out of Brenda's house.

13:06.873 --> 13:09.275
I refer, of course,
to dead Brenda,

13:09.309 --> 13:12.846
the slut all you boys wanted
to screw in high school.

13:12.879 --> 13:15.081
Many of you went on to do it,
I'm sure.

13:18.484 --> 13:21.988
I have yet to go
to the police.

13:22.022 --> 13:23.524
Tell Victoria

13:23.557 --> 13:26.827
if she pays me $1.3 million,

13:26.860 --> 13:30.430
I won't put her
precious little baby in jail.

13:30.463 --> 13:32.098
(music playing)

13:50.116 --> 13:52.318
I told you I went back.

13:52.352 --> 13:53.620
I understand,

13:53.654 --> 13:55.622
but the police couldn't
place you there at night,

13:55.656 --> 13:57.357
only during the afternoon.

13:57.390 --> 13:59.660
This is much more
damaging, Paul,

13:59.693 --> 14:02.368
to have you spotted leaving
at 10:30.

14:02.402 --> 14:04.505
You're not suggesting
that we pay her off, are you?

14:04.538 --> 14:06.306
No.

14:06.339 --> 14:07.741
But things
aren't getting any better.

14:07.774 --> 14:10.844
We've got to prepare ourselves.

14:10.877 --> 14:13.379
I'm sorry,
this is a lawyer-client meeting.

14:13.413 --> 14:14.648
Nothing personal.

14:14.681 --> 14:15.716
No, I thought
you'd like to know

14:15.749 --> 14:17.718
that we're officially charging
your client

14:17.751 --> 14:19.185
with the murder
of Brenda Wilbur.

14:20.521 --> 14:23.489
He'll be arraigned tomorrow
in Dedham Superior Court.

14:23.524 --> 14:25.526
(music playing)

14:54.888 --> 14:56.256
SHORE: I'm sorry.

14:56.289 --> 14:59.259
There's nothing

14:59.292 --> 15:00.801
that I can really say
at this point

15:00.834 --> 15:03.804
other than...

15:03.837 --> 15:05.639
you'll get through this.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.609
Did you know?

15:08.642 --> 15:10.143
About?

15:10.844 --> 15:12.846
Her.

15:15.015 --> 15:16.116
No.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.720
SHORE: I haven't
really kept in touch

15:19.753 --> 15:21.354
with Paul the last few years.

15:21.387 --> 15:23.990
You and me both.

15:26.492 --> 15:27.393
Melissa,

15:28.995 --> 15:30.263
Michael,

15:31.632 --> 15:34.067
when you were very young,

15:34.100 --> 15:35.569
I told you a story

15:35.602 --> 15:37.571
about my first day
at kindergarten.

15:38.104 --> 15:40.340
You probably don't remember.

15:40.974 --> 15:43.777
I was so scared,

15:43.810 --> 15:45.078
to the point of tears.

15:45.579 --> 15:48.882
And then this little boy
I didn't even know

15:48.915 --> 15:51.652
came up to me
and took ahold of my hand

15:52.753 --> 15:56.923
and told me everything
would be okay.

15:59.359 --> 16:03.036
Your dad...

16:03.069 --> 16:04.304
has held on to my hand

16:04.337 --> 16:08.108
through much of our childhood.

16:10.911 --> 16:14.080
He was then,
as he remains today,

16:14.114 --> 16:16.382
the most compassionate,

16:16.416 --> 16:19.786
gentle person I know.

16:22.455 --> 16:25.692
He did not commit this crime.

16:25.726 --> 16:30.564
He did not commit this crime.

16:35.168 --> 16:36.202
Okay.

16:36.236 --> 16:37.504
We'll see you then.

16:39.673 --> 16:41.842
He's still out in Dedham.
He'll be here in the morning.

16:41.875 --> 16:44.911
And then he's going back
to Dedham for the arraignment.

16:44.945 --> 16:46.547
This was really
his best friend?

16:46.580 --> 16:47.614
Evidently.

16:48.448 --> 16:49.783
He doesn't seem the type.

16:50.817 --> 16:51.618
I'm sorry?

16:52.418 --> 16:54.788
Alan to have a best friend.

16:55.622 --> 16:58.024
Eugene,

16:58.058 --> 17:01.902
a lot of values may
have passed him by,

17:01.935 --> 17:04.505
but friendship,

17:04.538 --> 17:07.641
and the loyalty
that goes along with it,

17:07.674 --> 17:09.810
he lives by that.

17:12.779 --> 17:15.781
(music playing)

17:39.139 --> 17:40.340
VICTORIA: Here you are.

17:42.175 --> 17:44.344
May I ask why?

17:44.377 --> 17:46.747
Just thought
I'd get a look at the room,

17:46.780 --> 17:48.414
see if it's how I remember.

17:50.050 --> 17:52.085
What are you doing here?

17:54.387 --> 17:56.189
Will he be granted bail?

17:57.558 --> 17:58.792
Well, he's a trusted,

17:58.825 --> 18:00.233
lifelong member
of the community,

18:00.266 --> 18:02.368
which his family half-built,

18:02.969 --> 18:04.004
strong roots,

18:04.037 --> 18:05.205
doctor,

18:05.238 --> 18:08.809
poses no threat to society.

18:08.842 --> 18:11.111
That and a million dollars
should get him bail.

18:17.518 --> 18:18.819
I'm gonna be candid.

18:18.852 --> 18:20.987
There's a switch.

18:21.021 --> 18:24.124
However accomplished
you are as a civil attorney,

18:24.157 --> 18:27.093
your criminal experience...

18:29.462 --> 18:31.932
would I be wise to look
for another lawyer, Alan?

18:31.965 --> 18:34.167
Please do not be offended.

18:34.935 --> 18:37.704
Victoria, you will micromanage
whoever tries this case.

18:37.738 --> 18:39.472
Best to go with someone
who won't be thrown

18:39.506 --> 18:40.574
by your interference.

18:42.442 --> 18:43.844
And if you don't like
what I'm doing,

18:43.877 --> 18:45.746
you can always pull down
my pants like old times

18:45.779 --> 18:47.247
and give me a spank.

18:48.048 --> 18:49.783
As I remember, you liked that.

18:58.324 --> 18:59.793
Did he do this?

19:01.768 --> 19:04.104
You know Paul.

19:04.137 --> 19:06.607
He could never be capable

19:06.640 --> 19:10.611
of bludgeoning the life out
of a human being.

19:11.978 --> 19:14.681
People change.

19:17.918 --> 19:20.621
If he only knew
what I've become.

19:21.588 --> 19:23.857
When you were 16,

19:23.890 --> 19:26.793
you slept
with your best friend's mother.

19:30.030 --> 19:33.033
How have you changed, Alan?

19:41.675 --> 19:43.644
I'd like to have Ellenor
join me.

19:43.677 --> 19:45.612
Tara, too.

19:45.646 --> 19:47.447
That should be enough for now.

19:47.480 --> 19:48.481
As we get closer to trial,

19:48.515 --> 19:49.816
we may need to add more.

19:49.850 --> 19:52.018
I know I can't monopolize
the whole firm, but--

19:52.052 --> 19:53.587
Can he pay for all this?

19:53.620 --> 19:54.821
His mother can.

19:54.855 --> 19:57.490
This is a check
for 750 as retainer.

19:57.524 --> 19:59.092
I told her
it'll likely go higher.

19:59.492 --> 20:00.967
Seven hundred
and fifty thousand?

20:01.001 --> 20:02.168
SHORE:
We should obviously hire

20:02.202 --> 20:03.604
a private investigator
immediately.

20:03.637 --> 20:05.038
Since you used
to be a PI, Eugene,

20:05.071 --> 20:06.940
it would be great if you were
able to oversee

20:06.973 --> 20:07.774
that end of it.

20:08.341 --> 20:10.276
Jimmy, did you use
to be anything?

20:11.177 --> 20:12.378
FRUTT: When's the arraignment?

20:12.412 --> 20:13.514
SHORE: This afternoon.

20:13.547 --> 20:16.249
Jamie, maybe you should head up
the legal research.

20:16.282 --> 20:18.118
We may be filing various motions
in limine.

20:18.151 --> 20:20.687
The exclusionary rule could be
optional with these people.

20:22.322 --> 20:23.356
I'm sure it's good.

20:23.790 --> 20:26.392
We should get going.
It's a schlep to Dedham.

20:26.426 --> 20:27.561
Can I make one observation?

20:27.594 --> 20:29.062
Certainly.

20:30.130 --> 20:31.665
You seem nervous.

20:32.465 --> 20:33.834
Ellenor has criminal experience.

20:33.867 --> 20:35.468
Maybe she should first-chair.

20:38.572 --> 20:39.706
I'm fine.

20:41.207 --> 20:42.809
Shall we?

20:49.716 --> 20:51.952
WOMAN: The arraignment itself
figures to be short.

20:51.985 --> 20:53.854
Basically a reading
of the charges,

20:53.887 --> 20:55.522
WOMAN: Possibly the setting
of a trial date.

20:55.556 --> 20:57.090
MAN: What we know
about the defense attorney,

20:57.123 --> 20:59.192
his name is Alan Shore,

20:59.225 --> 21:01.067
a prominent civil attorney

21:01.101 --> 21:03.469
primarily known
for his antitrust work.

21:03.504 --> 21:05.539
WOMAN: Hearing now that
he grew up with the defendant.

21:05.572 --> 21:08.241
That they, in fact,
were childhood friends.

21:10.376 --> 21:12.378
Commonwealth
vs. Paul Stewart,

21:12.412 --> 21:15.716
charging one count
in violation of general laws,

21:15.749 --> 21:17.818
Chapter 265,

21:17.851 --> 21:19.853
Subsection 1,

21:19.886 --> 21:21.522
murder in the first degree.

21:22.122 --> 21:23.824
(gavel bangs)

21:25.125 --> 21:26.593
WINNAKER: Quiet down.

21:28.194 --> 21:30.063
(gavel bangs)

21:30.096 --> 21:31.064
Quiet down!

21:34.100 --> 21:37.270
You people will have to calm
yourselves this very instant.

21:40.240 --> 21:43.109
Let me tell you
members of the media,

21:43.143 --> 21:46.379
I don't have much use
for the media.

21:46.412 --> 21:48.815
I let the media in only
so you can get your pictures

21:48.849 --> 21:51.718
and be done with it,
now I can be done with you.

21:52.619 --> 21:54.320
I won't have the media

21:54.354 --> 21:57.624
spew their toxic waste
in my room.

22:00.701 --> 22:01.735
Mr. Shore,

22:02.869 --> 22:04.270
I understand you have waived

22:04.304 --> 22:05.872
a formal reading
of the charges?

22:05.906 --> 22:07.107
SHORE: That's correct,
Your Honor.

22:07.140 --> 22:08.775
I'd also like
to enter my appearance

22:08.809 --> 22:10.577
along with Ms. Ellenor Frutt's
at this time.

22:10.977 --> 22:12.579
So noted.

22:12.613 --> 22:13.914
Is there a question of bail?

22:13.947 --> 22:15.181
CLARKE: Yes, Your Honor.

22:15.215 --> 22:17.283
The Commonwealth opposes bail.

22:17.317 --> 22:19.653
Dr. Stewart has no prior record,
Your Honor.

22:19.686 --> 22:21.321
He's never even been
charged with a crime.

22:21.354 --> 22:24.324
Well, he sure picked a beaut
to start out with, didn't he?

22:24.357 --> 22:26.893
He poses neither a safety
nor flight risk.

22:26.927 --> 22:28.962
He has extremely strong roots
in the community.

22:28.995 --> 22:30.096
WINNAKER:
How many times have you appeared

22:30.130 --> 22:31.998
before me, Mr. Shore?

22:32.032 --> 22:33.266
Why?

22:33.299 --> 22:34.434
Does it get old?

22:35.101 --> 22:37.070
Is that an insult?

22:37.103 --> 22:38.739
Sounds like
he may have insulted me.

22:38.772 --> 22:39.472
Read that back.

22:40.273 --> 22:41.942
"Why? Does it get old?"

22:41.975 --> 22:43.309
SHORE: Objection
to the reading, Judge.

22:43.343 --> 22:45.378
It lacked nuance.

22:45.846 --> 22:46.980
Read that back.

22:47.013 --> 22:48.682
WOMAN: "Objection
to the reading, Judge.

22:48.715 --> 22:50.283
It lacked nuance."

22:50.316 --> 22:52.118
SHORE:
Renew my objection, Judge.

22:52.152 --> 22:54.487
The reporter is flat tonally.

22:54.521 --> 22:55.989
WINNAKER:
He sounds like a smartass.

22:56.823 --> 22:57.858
Is he an ass?

22:57.891 --> 22:58.959
SHORE: Your Honor,

22:58.992 --> 23:00.601
my client poses no danger.

23:00.634 --> 23:01.702
He's not going anywhere.

23:02.135 --> 23:04.738
Two million, cash.

23:04.771 --> 23:06.640
We'll conference
on Wednesday at 10:00

23:06.673 --> 23:07.741
to set our schedules.

23:07.774 --> 23:08.642
(gavel bangs)

23:08.675 --> 23:10.511
WINNAKER: We're adjourned.

23:10.544 --> 23:12.913
(overlapping chatter)

23:12.946 --> 23:14.414
(camera shutters clicking)

23:14.981 --> 23:16.282
MAN: Mrs. Stewart, this is--

23:16.316 --> 23:18.318
Mrs. Stewart, I'd like to get
a (indistinct)

23:18.351 --> 23:21.622
(music playing)

23:24.124 --> 23:28.128
CHOIR:
(singing in foreign language)

24:07.207 --> 24:10.176
We, of course, will have
a formal memorial service,

24:10.210 --> 24:11.344
soon to be scheduled,

24:12.045 --> 24:14.314
but considering the enormity
of this tragedy,

24:14.347 --> 24:15.949
many of you wanted
to convene today.

24:17.417 --> 24:19.820
And I support that.

24:19.853 --> 24:23.023
Brenda Wilbur was a beloved
member of this community,

24:24.190 --> 24:26.126
a lifelong resident.

24:26.159 --> 24:26.993
And it's at times like these

24:27.027 --> 24:29.996
that we as a community...

24:30.030 --> 24:31.297
come together.

24:35.869 --> 24:38.071
The first thing
we need to discuss is venue.

24:38.104 --> 24:41.608
Is Dedham the best place
for this trial?

24:41.642 --> 24:42.909
Why wouldn't it be?

24:42.943 --> 24:46.346
Well, everybody here
knows your son.

24:46.379 --> 24:47.280
SHORE:
That's a good thing, Ellenor.

24:47.313 --> 24:49.015
His reputation is impeccable.

24:49.049 --> 24:50.684
FRUTT:
It can't be impeccable, Alan.

24:50.717 --> 24:52.285
He had an affair.

24:52.318 --> 24:53.620
SHORE:
They know him to be gentle,

24:53.654 --> 24:56.022
caring, incapable of.

24:56.056 --> 24:57.724
And the other potential problem

24:57.758 --> 24:59.760
is that everybody here

24:59.793 --> 25:01.201
seems to know you.

25:02.435 --> 25:03.837
Meaning?

25:03.870 --> 25:05.539
You're not
the most upstanding citizen

25:05.572 --> 25:07.173
on the eastern seaboard.

25:07.207 --> 25:10.043
My life of indiscretion
started after I left Dedham.

25:10.076 --> 25:12.145
VICTORIA:
The trial will be here.

25:12.178 --> 25:13.847
Everyone who knows Paul

25:13.880 --> 25:15.281
knows that he couldn't
have committed

25:15.315 --> 25:16.850
that kind of violence.

25:16.883 --> 25:20.386
That has to inure to his
benefit with the jury pool.

25:20.420 --> 25:22.322
FRUTT: Thirdly,

25:22.355 --> 25:24.691
people like to see
the high and mighty fall.

25:24.725 --> 25:25.759
It's human nature.

25:25.792 --> 25:27.661
If anything,
Paul comes off as meek.

25:29.563 --> 25:30.964
But you don't.

25:31.364 --> 25:32.833
I don't mean to sound rude,

25:32.866 --> 25:36.102
but from my cursory check
on the pulse of this town,

25:36.136 --> 25:37.738
the dislike of you runs deep.

25:38.672 --> 25:40.641
I'd hate for the jury
to convict Paul

25:40.674 --> 25:42.676
to vicariously get back at--

25:42.709 --> 25:43.810
What's your name again?

25:46.880 --> 25:47.814
Ellenor.

25:47.848 --> 25:49.182
You're discharged, Ellenor.

25:50.083 --> 25:51.552
SHORE: That's not
a good idea, Victoria.

25:51.585 --> 25:53.353
VICTORIA: I don't want her part
of the defense team.

25:53.386 --> 25:54.555
Paul, this is your defense.

25:54.588 --> 25:56.456
VICTORIA: I'm paying for it.

25:57.791 --> 25:58.859
I won't pay for her.

26:00.400 --> 26:02.869
You're welcome to stay
and observe pro bono,

26:02.903 --> 26:04.437
but the sound of your voice,

26:04.470 --> 26:05.438
that would be a deal breaker.

26:05.471 --> 26:06.439
Mom.
VICTORIA: No, I know

26:06.472 --> 26:08.942
what the people of Dedham
respond to, Paul.

26:08.975 --> 26:10.276
That's how I built my fortune,

26:10.310 --> 26:12.546
and they will not
respond to this...

26:14.180 --> 26:15.415
Ellenor.

26:19.019 --> 26:19.920
You're discharged.

26:19.953 --> 26:21.454
May I speak to you in private?

26:21.487 --> 26:22.422
VICTORIA: No.

26:22.455 --> 26:24.224
You can either leave with her

26:24.257 --> 26:25.826
or stay without her.

26:33.466 --> 26:35.035
I'll see you back at the office.

26:47.113 --> 26:48.615
One of the best
criminal-defense attorneys

26:48.649 --> 26:50.050
in this state
just walked out that door.

26:50.083 --> 26:51.785
The only reason...

26:51.818 --> 26:53.654
I don't walk out
with her is because of Paul.

26:54.621 --> 26:55.455
That's nice.

26:57.457 --> 26:59.392
Let's turn to the
most pressing matter,

26:59.425 --> 27:01.267
Catherine Piper.

27:01.301 --> 27:02.936
How are we arranging
to pay her off?

27:02.969 --> 27:03.737
We aren't.

27:04.705 --> 27:05.806
Mom, that will come back to--

27:05.839 --> 27:08.509
If she testifies that
she saw you leave the house

27:08.542 --> 27:11.144
at 10:30 in an agitated state--

27:11.177 --> 27:14.581
I cannot bribe this witness.

27:14.615 --> 27:17.818
Alan, who do you think
you're kidding?

27:17.851 --> 27:18.785
Look, this woman--

27:18.819 --> 27:21.287
This is one of your
most dear friends.

27:23.590 --> 27:24.525
Victoria.

27:24.558 --> 27:27.894
I'm not letting
my only child go to prison.

27:29.730 --> 27:31.765
If you wanna walk out now,

27:31.798 --> 27:32.999
do it,

27:33.033 --> 27:35.301
but Catherine Piper
will not be testifying

27:35.335 --> 27:37.137
as to what she saw...

27:37.170 --> 27:39.540
the night Brenda Wilbur
was killed.

27:51.117 --> 27:52.819
I can see
you've found great success

27:52.853 --> 27:54.755
in holding your own with her.

27:54.788 --> 27:56.923
I don't want you committing
any crimes on my behalf.

27:56.957 --> 27:58.024
I wanna make that clear.

27:58.058 --> 27:59.492
Yes, you just didn't
want to make it clear

27:59.526 --> 28:00.901
in front of your mother.

28:02.569 --> 28:03.469
She's still a force.

28:03.504 --> 28:04.505
What can I say?

28:04.538 --> 28:06.239
How about "No?"

28:16.850 --> 28:18.652
I don't mean to judge you.

28:20.120 --> 28:21.221
Yes, you do.

28:24.991 --> 28:27.994
(music playing)

28:41.107 --> 28:42.943
Excuse me, sir.
I'm looking for God

28:42.976 --> 28:44.410
and the men's room.

28:44.444 --> 28:45.979
Could you point me
in the right direction?

28:46.012 --> 28:47.013
DUGAN: It's true,

28:47.047 --> 28:48.782
you're really back.

28:52.052 --> 28:53.887
Still in the sin business,
I see.

28:53.920 --> 28:56.356
As are you, I'm sure.

28:56.389 --> 28:59.092
Ah, it's good to see you.

28:59.125 --> 29:01.101
Although not under
these circumstances.

29:02.503 --> 29:04.571
He's in terrible trouble, Tom.

29:05.539 --> 29:07.040
Are you gonna be able
to help him?

29:07.073 --> 29:08.274
SHORE: I hope so.

29:08.308 --> 29:11.411
I haven't kept in constant
touch the last few years.

29:12.613 --> 29:14.147
Am I missing anything?

29:14.180 --> 29:15.148
Is it possible--

29:15.181 --> 29:16.950
Paul?

29:16.983 --> 29:18.318
God, no.

29:18.351 --> 29:19.986
Of course not.

29:20.020 --> 29:21.221
There are many people
who probably

29:21.254 --> 29:22.288
had it in for that woman.

29:22.322 --> 29:23.757
Which is why I'm here.

29:24.858 --> 29:26.627
Sorry?

29:26.660 --> 29:27.761
You were her priest.

29:27.794 --> 29:28.962
DUGAN: Uh-hmm.

29:28.995 --> 29:30.597
I'm assuming
she practiced confession.

29:30.631 --> 29:32.833
Did she ever
mention anything?

29:32.866 --> 29:34.601
I can't talk about anything
said in confession, you know--

29:34.635 --> 29:36.637
She's dead.

29:36.670 --> 29:39.339
The seal survives death.

29:39.372 --> 29:40.607
I think you know that.

29:41.174 --> 29:43.877
Paul's on trial
for his life here.

29:43.910 --> 29:46.179
If you know something
that can help him.

29:48.949 --> 29:50.316
I can't break...

29:50.350 --> 29:51.952
the confessional seal.

29:55.822 --> 29:58.458
Perhaps something you thought
she said in confession,

29:58.892 --> 30:01.134
something she
actually said...

30:01.167 --> 30:02.368
here or...

30:02.402 --> 30:04.871
just outside
the confessional.

30:07.040 --> 30:09.209
You'd be able to share that,
wouldn't you, Tom?

30:10.343 --> 30:13.346
This isn't about skirting
a rule, Alan.

30:13.379 --> 30:15.381
I have an obligation to God.

30:17.884 --> 30:19.219
If you know anything

30:19.252 --> 30:21.722
you can share, Tom,

30:21.755 --> 30:22.823
now's the time.

30:25.025 --> 30:27.093
And I'm the person
to share it with.

30:34.801 --> 30:35.836
It's good to see you again.

30:38.238 --> 30:39.205
You too.

30:42.075 --> 30:45.078
(music playing)

30:56.289 --> 30:58.559
SHORE: Both rule 13 and rule 14.

30:58.592 --> 31:00.466
Make sure you get
a bill of particulars.

31:00.500 --> 31:03.003
And ask them for any evidence
in their possession

31:03.036 --> 31:05.471
that supports
any affirmative defense,

31:05.506 --> 31:08.909
be it insanity, intoxication,
alibi, anything, Jamie.

31:08.942 --> 31:10.276
Right. Make it
as far-reaching as you can--

31:10.310 --> 31:13.313
(dog barking)

31:15.048 --> 31:16.850
Yeah. Uh...

31:16.883 --> 31:18.284
I'll get back to you.

31:24.257 --> 31:25.025
Thank you.

31:25.058 --> 31:25.992
VICTORIA: Alan!

31:26.026 --> 31:28.562
I believe you've met
Catherine Piper.

31:29.563 --> 31:30.697
What is she doing here?

31:31.264 --> 31:32.432
Why, I'm here to suck on

31:32.465 --> 31:34.735
one of Victoria's shriveled
nipples, of course.

31:35.335 --> 31:36.570
Is that why you're here, Alan,

31:37.137 --> 31:40.440
or is it just to drop some
dog crap off at the door?

31:41.742 --> 31:43.376
Victoria, I need to have
a word with you now.

31:44.711 --> 31:46.647
Would you excuse us, Catherine?

31:46.680 --> 31:48.248
Why, of course, honey.

31:55.221 --> 31:56.690
You cannot do this.

31:56.723 --> 31:58.559
I've already made the deal.

31:58.592 --> 32:01.968
That woman
is extremely unstable.

32:02.002 --> 32:03.670
She absolutely
cannot be trusted,

32:03.704 --> 32:05.438
and if this ever gets out--

32:05.471 --> 32:06.272
VICTORIA: If it gets out,

32:06.306 --> 32:07.908
we simply say she's lying,

32:07.941 --> 32:10.176
or like you say,
she's unstable.

32:11.344 --> 32:13.547
SHORE: This is so dangerous.

32:13.580 --> 32:15.481
What's dangerous...

32:15.516 --> 32:17.050
would be her testimony.

32:17.083 --> 32:18.484
SHORE: Victoria, this could...

32:18.519 --> 32:20.420
bury your son in the end.

32:20.453 --> 32:23.189
VICTORIA: You know,
I've made my life trusting--

32:23.223 --> 32:25.158
This is Paul's life.

32:26.893 --> 32:29.395
You seem
to keep forgetting that.

32:30.731 --> 32:33.499
You can stay...

32:33.534 --> 32:35.368
or you can go.

32:43.009 --> 32:44.244
I thought I heard words.

32:44.277 --> 32:46.279
Were you two having words?

32:46.312 --> 32:48.682
You will also
be available to testify

32:48.715 --> 32:51.552
that you saw Paul
leave at 5:00 PM

32:51.585 --> 32:55.155
and that you saw neither him
nor his car after that.

32:55.689 --> 32:58.792
Victoria,
that would be perjury.

32:58.825 --> 33:01.101
The price goes up
for perjury.

33:01.602 --> 33:04.705
You will do it
for this price, Catherine.

33:09.142 --> 33:11.277
It must be awful
to be at the mercy

33:11.311 --> 33:12.679
of one of the little people.

33:13.479 --> 33:15.081
Imagine, Victoria,

33:15.115 --> 33:16.482
if I passed you on the street,

33:16.517 --> 33:18.852
you wouldn't so much
as make eye contact

33:18.885 --> 33:21.387
for fear of brushing
with a commoner.

33:21.421 --> 33:23.890
And now I'm in your dining room,

33:23.924 --> 33:26.927
drinking from your China.

33:26.960 --> 33:28.494
And you have to look at me.

33:29.930 --> 33:32.465
Look at me, Victoria.

33:32.498 --> 33:34.500
This is what can happen
to vicious,

33:34.535 --> 33:37.904
soulless people
such as yourself.

33:37.938 --> 33:41.041
Little people lay in wait
to screw you over.

33:41.842 --> 33:43.977
You walk around this town
like you own it.

33:44.010 --> 33:46.412
And I suppose much
of it you do.

33:46.847 --> 33:48.148
Well...

33:48.181 --> 33:50.817
I guess you don't own
its people, do you?

33:50.851 --> 33:52.953
Don't be silly, Catherine.

33:52.986 --> 33:54.688
I'm buying you right now.

33:55.756 --> 33:58.024
And that'll be your legacy,
won't it?

33:58.058 --> 34:00.500
Catherine Piper...

34:00.534 --> 34:02.736
for sale.

34:02.769 --> 34:05.772
(music playing)

34:10.143 --> 34:11.945
Mr. Shore, Mr. Shore,

34:11.978 --> 34:13.413
could you give us
a brief statement or two

34:13.446 --> 34:14.480
about what's going on--

34:14.514 --> 34:15.815
SHORE:
He never pitches past seven,

34:15.849 --> 34:17.518
it was insane to let him return

34:17.551 --> 34:18.719
for the eighth
and everybody knew it,

34:18.752 --> 34:20.485
and it is equally insane
for any of us

34:20.521 --> 34:23.188
to ever,
ever get sucked in again.

34:25.525 --> 34:27.427
Maybe I should stay
at my mother's for a while.

34:27.460 --> 34:29.696
I'm sure she'd love it.

34:29.730 --> 34:31.732
Did you know she's paying off
Catherine Piper?

34:32.364 --> 34:34.333
If she insists on interfering,

34:34.367 --> 34:35.268
you're the only one

34:35.301 --> 34:36.670
with the authority
to banish her.

34:36.703 --> 34:39.505
If I say do that, Paul,
you must.

34:40.974 --> 34:42.676
Wendy's leaving.

34:42.708 --> 34:44.377
I beg your pardon?

34:44.409 --> 34:46.411
She's leaving me.

34:48.614 --> 34:49.550
She's planning to--

34:49.583 --> 34:50.684
Where is she?

34:50.717 --> 34:52.318
In the kitchen.

34:54.154 --> 34:56.289
I tried to talk to her.

35:04.237 --> 35:06.139
You need to wait until
after the trial is over.

35:06.172 --> 35:06.973
WENDY: Why?

35:07.007 --> 35:08.408
Because it might and probably

35:08.441 --> 35:10.276
will negatively
influence the jury.

35:10.310 --> 35:11.912
You need to be by his side,
at his side.

35:11.945 --> 35:12.813
I can't do that.

35:12.846 --> 35:13.814
SHORE: If not for your husband,

35:13.847 --> 35:16.082
then for your children's father.

35:17.718 --> 35:20.386
I'm not speaking
as a marriage counselor, Wen--

35:20.420 --> 35:21.555
the dish is dry.

35:29.095 --> 35:29.963
Look at me.

35:32.298 --> 35:33.333
Believe it or not,

35:33.366 --> 35:35.168
wives don't statistically

35:35.201 --> 35:37.971
leave their husbands
over infidelity.

35:38.004 --> 35:41.241
With the remotest possibility
that you walking out

35:41.274 --> 35:42.809
could be perceived
as you thinking

35:42.843 --> 35:43.910
he's guilty of murder,

35:43.944 --> 35:45.445
and there is that possibility,

35:45.478 --> 35:47.514
you cannot walk out
that door now.

35:47.548 --> 35:49.783
Maybe I do think
he's guilty of murder.

35:51.151 --> 35:53.286
You haven't asked
my opinion on that, Alan.

35:54.521 --> 35:56.557
PAUL: Let me ask.

35:58.792 --> 36:01.001
Do you think I'm guilty, Wendy?

36:03.169 --> 36:04.104
I don't know.

36:06.139 --> 36:07.574
What, I'm supposed to assume

36:07.608 --> 36:09.543
that I know you, that--

36:09.576 --> 36:11.612
You know I'm not capable
of violence.

36:11.645 --> 36:14.247
I didn't think
that you were capable--

36:17.383 --> 36:19.485
I'll tell you
what I'm not capable of,

36:19.520 --> 36:20.921
walking into a courthouse

36:20.954 --> 36:23.790
day after day by your side,
pretending.

36:27.160 --> 36:28.829
SHORE: If you don't pretend,

36:28.862 --> 36:31.798
he could be
going to prison for life,

36:34.100 --> 36:36.302
for a crime he didn't commit.

36:37.337 --> 36:40.440
No matter how angry
you are with him...

36:40.473 --> 36:41.608
right now,

36:44.210 --> 36:46.312
you can't possibly want that.

36:51.985 --> 36:53.654
Will she stay?

36:53.687 --> 36:55.255
SHORE: For now.

36:55.288 --> 36:56.590
Hopefully,
her anger will subside,

36:56.623 --> 36:58.592
and they'll work it out.

37:01.935 --> 37:03.537
Victoria,
I know how desperately

37:03.570 --> 37:05.071
you wanna save your son,

37:05.104 --> 37:08.141
but you must, you must

37:08.174 --> 37:10.243
let me handle the defense.

37:10.276 --> 37:11.745
You're gonna end up
hurting him,

37:11.778 --> 37:13.012
I promise you.

37:13.680 --> 37:15.549
Just tell me you'll win.

37:15.582 --> 37:17.617
SHORE: I can't do that
at this point.

37:17.651 --> 37:19.753
It's too soon
to predict anything yet.

37:19.786 --> 37:22.756
The case thus far
is circumstantial.

37:22.789 --> 37:23.790
I work for perhaps

37:23.824 --> 37:25.458
the best criminal-defense firm

37:25.491 --> 37:26.693
in the Commonwealth.

37:26.727 --> 37:28.962
We have every reason
to be optimistic.

37:35.235 --> 37:38.271
Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln,
how was the play?

37:45.011 --> 37:47.514
Catherine Piper is a petty,

37:47.548 --> 37:50.383
vicious woman,

37:50.416 --> 37:52.385
and I'm sorry.

37:52.418 --> 37:56.222
People like Catherine Piper
can only shoot spitballs.

37:56.256 --> 37:57.390
Spitballs sting.

38:00.567 --> 38:01.868
You know, Alan,

38:04.037 --> 38:06.039
I've always believed
that people regret

38:06.072 --> 38:08.008
more the things
they don't do

38:08.041 --> 38:09.543
than the ones they do.

38:11.645 --> 38:13.479
But one thing I did,

38:14.715 --> 38:16.650
which I've long regretted,

38:19.052 --> 38:20.787
was sleeping with you.

38:23.289 --> 38:24.758
I'm sorry to hear that.

38:27.160 --> 38:29.796
I wasn't a virgin,
if it makes you feel better.

38:29.830 --> 38:32.799
Oh, it was quite clear
at the time

38:32.833 --> 38:34.267
that you weren't a virgin.

38:35.836 --> 38:38.171
No, it isn't that

38:38.204 --> 38:40.406
or even that you were young

38:40.440 --> 38:43.309
or even that you were
Paul's best friend.

38:44.410 --> 38:45.812
What is it, then?

38:47.914 --> 38:51.017
I suspected that you'd fallen
in love with me.

38:55.488 --> 38:56.990
Did I hurt you?

39:00.701 --> 39:02.836
Victoria, I was 16.

39:05.639 --> 39:08.008
Can a boy even
be capable of love?

39:12.245 --> 39:14.981
What I remember most...

39:15.015 --> 39:16.349
was your kiss.

39:18.284 --> 39:21.254
16-year-olds tend to kiss

39:21.287 --> 39:23.056
like they're
eating chicken fingers.

39:23.089 --> 39:25.692
How many teenagers
have you been with?

39:26.860 --> 39:28.995
Yours...

39:29.029 --> 39:31.331
were so...

39:31.364 --> 39:33.767
soft,

39:33.800 --> 39:34.968
gentle.

39:38.004 --> 39:39.573
Loving, I guess.

39:47.413 --> 39:48.582
It's late.

39:52.686 --> 39:54.354
And I have a long drive.

39:56.623 --> 39:57.558
Yeah.

40:01.902 --> 40:03.670
Good night, Victoria.

40:07.273 --> 40:08.341
Night.

40:11.878 --> 40:15.148
(music playing)

40:57.323 --> 41:00.333
(music playing)

41:23.724 --> 41:24.791
WOMAN: You stinker.

41:24.825 --> 41:27.794
(music playing)
