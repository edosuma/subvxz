00:00.066 --> 00:02.267
Adult adam: <i> Back in the '80s,</i>
<i> being a man's man was simple.</i>

00:02.269 --> 00:04.770
<i> All you needed</i>
<i> was muscles or a mustache.</i>

00:04.772 --> 00:08.307
<i> Unfortunately, I was miles</i>
<i> from dolph lundgren</i>

00:08.309 --> 00:10.075
<i> And no chuck norris...Yet.</i>

00:10.077 --> 00:12.311
Get scared, boys.
Goldberg's coming for you.

00:12.313 --> 00:15.748
Adult adam:
<i> I was what you'd call</i>
<i> a late bloomer,</i>

00:15.750 --> 00:17.182
<i> Like the latest...Ever.</i>

00:17.184 --> 00:19.985
What's up, goldnerd?
How was your winter break?

00:19.987 --> 00:22.254
J.C. Spink? What the...

00:22.256 --> 00:23.222
What happened to you?

00:23.224 --> 00:26.492
Grew a ton, I stink,
got acne all over my back.

00:26.494 --> 00:27.059
It's awesome.

00:27.061 --> 00:29.828
<i> But worst of all,</i>
<i> the girls were growing</i>
<i> even faster,</i>

00:29.830 --> 00:33.265
<i> Especially my girlfriend,</i>
<i> dana caldwell.</i>

00:33.267 --> 00:35.801
Anthony: Yo, girls.

00:35.803 --> 00:36.935
Mainly you.

00:36.937 --> 00:37.669
Um, hi.

00:37.671 --> 00:38.604
There's a party
at the water tower.

00:38.606 --> 00:40.406
Usually there's
no freshman allowed,

00:40.408 --> 00:41.974
But for you,
I'll make an exception.

00:41.976 --> 00:43.108
Actually,
I'm not a freshmen.

00:43.110 --> 00:45.544
Adam f. Goldberg.
Pleasure.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.146
Uh, what's this
about a party?

00:47.148 --> 00:49.081
Uh, I'll see you there,
dana.

00:49.083 --> 00:51.083
And, uh, don't bring
your little brother.

00:51.085 --> 00:54.653
I'm actually four months
and 16 days older than her,

00:54.655 --> 00:55.421
And we're together.

00:55.423 --> 00:57.723
Weird. Anthony balsamo
knows my name.

00:57.725 --> 01:00.426
And he's such a mensch
to invite both of us.

01:00.428 --> 01:01.393
Wait...
You want to go to that?

01:01.395 --> 01:03.328
It's just gonna be a bunch
of rowdy high-school guys

01:03.330 --> 01:05.130
Spray-painting dirty words
on the water tower.

01:05.132 --> 01:07.800
Big, bad adam ain't afraid
of no water tower.

01:07.802 --> 01:08.467
Or ghosts, fyi.

01:08.469 --> 01:11.937
Adult adam:
<i> I desperately wanted</i>
<i> my girlfriend, dana,</i>

01:11.939 --> 01:12.971
<i> To see me as a man.</i>

01:12.973 --> 01:15.140
Are you standing
on your tiptoes?

01:15.142 --> 01:15.674
Don't think so.

01:15.676 --> 01:18.243
Adult adam:
<i> And if it wasn't</i>
<i> gonna happen on its own,</i>

01:18.245 --> 01:20.579
<i> I would kick-start</i>
<i> the process myself.</i>

01:20.581 --> 01:21.914
What the hell
are you doing?

01:21.916 --> 01:23.882
I'm stimulating
the follicles.

01:23.884 --> 01:24.950
I read it in <i> gq.</i>

01:24.952 --> 01:27.519
It's a magazine
for stylish men of means.

01:27.521 --> 01:28.387
Okay, everybody out.

01:28.389 --> 01:30.289
I need to use the...
Oh, my god.

01:30.291 --> 01:31.657
Are you using
my lady bic?

01:31.659 --> 01:33.892
I'm stimulating
the follicles!

01:33.894 --> 01:34.660
Ha, you suck!

01:34.662 --> 01:37.429
Barry, get the camera!
Adam's being adam!

01:37.431 --> 01:39.131
What's with all the yelling?

01:39.133 --> 01:39.798
Oh, my joy!

01:39.800 --> 01:41.767
Is my baby
trying to shave?

01:41.769 --> 01:44.069
(gasps)
I'm stimulating
the follicles.

01:44.071 --> 01:45.971
Oh!
I got the polaroid!

01:45.973 --> 01:48.807
Say peach fuzz!

01:48.809 --> 01:49.908
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

01:49.910 --> 01:54.480
<i> ¶ but nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

01:55.815 --> 01:56.949
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

01:56.951 --> 02:00.786
<i> ¶ but the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

02:00.788 --> 02:03.422
Adult adam:
<i> It was January 7th,</i>
<i> 1980-something,</i>

02:03.424 --> 02:07.559
<i> And my brother, barry,</i>
<i> had his first</i>
<i> real-live girlfriend,</i>

02:07.561 --> 02:08.293
<i> Lainey lewis.</i>

02:08.295 --> 02:11.396
You went through my backpack
and ate my pudding?

02:11.398 --> 02:11.964
Who does that?

02:11.966 --> 02:14.733
Aw, so cute
when my boyfriend flies
into a rage over pudding.

02:14.735 --> 02:16.368
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold up.

02:16.370 --> 02:18.370
You just said "boyfriend"
out loud,

02:18.372 --> 02:20.772
In front of other
teenage human people.

02:20.774 --> 02:22.241
Dude, it's not a big deal.

02:22.243 --> 02:23.809
It's just...

02:23.811 --> 02:26.011
I've never been this happy.

02:26.013 --> 02:26.645
Aw.

02:26.647 --> 02:27.980
Don't celebrate just yet.

02:27.982 --> 02:29.815
My dad has to meet
your dad first.

02:29.817 --> 02:30.983
It's like his only rule.

02:30.985 --> 02:33.218
He needs to know
you come from good stock.

02:33.220 --> 02:33.752
I don't.

02:33.754 --> 02:36.221
You've seen my stock.
It's like terrible stock.

02:36.223 --> 02:36.989
I have a plan.

02:36.991 --> 02:38.557
We'll have you guys
come to a football game,

02:38.559 --> 02:40.058
So they'll be distracted
and drinking a lot.

02:40.060 --> 02:41.927
That's genius!
Think you can get him
to come over?

02:41.929 --> 02:45.597
Hey, big tasty knows
how to handle
murray goldberg.

02:45.599 --> 02:49.334
There's a 100% chance
my dad will be there.

02:49.336 --> 02:52.104
There's a zero percent chance
I will be there.

02:52.106 --> 02:54.006
Please. It's just one
little football game.

02:54.008 --> 02:56.808
Little? We're talking
cowboys-eagles here!

02:56.810 --> 02:58.177
It's the biggest game
of the year.

02:58.179 --> 03:00.979
It's the only thing I care
about in the entire world.

03:00.981 --> 03:02.447
More than your child?
Yes.

03:02.449 --> 03:04.950
You put me in a position
where I had to say it,

03:04.952 --> 03:07.186
And now that I did,
I feel free.

03:07.188 --> 03:10.022
If I hear you say no again,
I'm hulking out.

03:10.024 --> 03:13.292
We're talking
screaming and swearing.

03:13.294 --> 03:16.662
I'm gonna smash
this decorative box!

03:16.664 --> 03:17.429
Do not hulk out!

03:17.431 --> 03:19.164
Do not smash
that decorative box!

03:19.166 --> 03:22.034
Say goodbye
to the decorative box!

03:22.036 --> 03:24.269
Your mom keeps
her knickknacks in there.

03:24.271 --> 03:26.605
I'll destroy
her knickknacks, too!

03:26.607 --> 03:28.473
Hulk doesn't respect
knickknacks!

03:28.475 --> 03:31.109
Fine!
I'll do your stupid thing!

03:31.111 --> 03:32.611
Where are we going again?

03:32.613 --> 03:34.146
Do you even listen
when I talk?

03:34.148 --> 03:36.582
I get the gist of it,
say no a lot.

03:36.584 --> 03:38.050
I make it work.

03:38.052 --> 03:39.651
I'm cool with that.

03:39.653 --> 03:42.087
Adult adam:
<i> While barry was hulking out</i>
<i> for lainey,</i>

03:42.089 --> 03:45.090
<i> I was bulking up for dana.</i>

03:45.092 --> 03:47.192
"buns of steel?"

03:48.228 --> 03:49.494
"just five minutes a day

03:49.496 --> 03:51.697
"for the working mom
on the go."

03:51.699 --> 03:53.031
That can vaguely apply
to me.

03:53.033 --> 03:55.667
Okay, what's going on
with you?

03:55.669 --> 03:57.703
All the guys at school
are turning into grown men,

03:57.705 --> 03:59.972
And I still have
a little-boy body.

03:59.974 --> 04:01.039
Ah, puberty.

04:01.041 --> 04:04.243
I was an early
bloomer myself.

04:04.245 --> 04:05.811
Those were the days.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.246
(sighs)
that's not helpful,
is it?

04:07.248 --> 04:11.250
No! My girlfriend's
is about to be stolen
by anthony balsamo.

04:11.252 --> 04:14.119
I don't know who this
balsamic character is,

04:14.121 --> 04:16.822
But I'm sure
you don't need to worry.

04:16.824 --> 04:18.323
No, he should worry.

04:18.325 --> 04:19.124
Panic even.

04:19.126 --> 04:21.059
I mean,
anthony balsamo's a 10.

04:21.061 --> 04:21.927
Mom says I'm a 10.

04:21.929 --> 04:23.729
She also says
barry can be a doctor.

04:23.731 --> 04:25.998
Oh, god, pops,
help me!

04:26.000 --> 04:26.832
It's a lie, I'm not a 10.

04:26.834 --> 04:29.368
If anthony balsamo's
got his eye on your girl,

04:29.370 --> 04:30.269
You got to think big.

04:30.271 --> 04:32.771
In this case,
maybe a diamond or a car

04:32.773 --> 04:34.773
Or an exotic trip
around the world.

04:34.775 --> 04:38.310
Adam, you can't buy
a girlfriend.

04:38.711 --> 04:39.745
Unless she's
out of your league.

04:39.747 --> 04:41.747
Then you've got to pull out
all the stops.

04:41.749 --> 04:43.482
Okay, then, jewelry it is.

04:43.484 --> 04:46.318
I could give her my sweet
green lantern ring.

04:46.320 --> 04:47.085
Or you keep looking.

04:47.087 --> 04:49.321
No, it's perfect.
Just sleep on it.

04:49.323 --> 04:51.256
Why?
It glows and everything.

04:51.258 --> 04:53.392
It's for nerds, okay?

04:53.394 --> 04:55.193
Nerds.

04:55.195 --> 04:56.461
I'm sorry,

04:56.463 --> 04:59.164
But you left me
no choice.

04:59.166 --> 05:00.666
Adult adam:
<i> They were right.</i>

05:00.668 --> 05:02.501
<i> They only way</i>
<i> to lock down dana</i>

05:02.503 --> 05:03.502
<i> Was with a big,</i>
<i> sparkly ring.</i>

05:03.504 --> 05:07.372
<i> Lucky for me,</i>
<i> my nana left me</i>
<i> the perfect one.</i>

05:07.374 --> 05:08.307
<i> My mom said, one day,</i>

05:08.309 --> 05:09.975
<i> I'd give it to the woman</i>
<i> of my dreams.</i>

05:09.977 --> 05:14.012
<i> Surely, she was thinking</i>
<i> middle school, right?</i>

05:14.014 --> 05:16.148
(gasps)

05:17.250 --> 05:18.450
You like?
Adam, it's too much.

05:18.452 --> 05:22.421
Nothing's too much
for my number one
special lady friend.

05:22.423 --> 05:24.256
(laughs)
it's beautiful.

05:24.258 --> 05:26.124
Be sure to wear it tonight
to the water tower.

05:26.126 --> 05:27.859
You still want go
to that party?

05:27.861 --> 05:29.328
That balsamo kid
was nice enough
to invite us.

05:29.330 --> 05:32.731
The least we could do
is pop in and
show your ring off.

05:32.733 --> 05:34.066
Adam frederick goldberg!

05:34.068 --> 05:36.268
Put it away. Oh, god.
Hide your ring.

05:36.270 --> 05:37.536
Oh, god, she knows.

05:37.538 --> 05:38.770
How does she know?
How do you know?

05:38.772 --> 05:41.039
I have an itemized inventory
right here

05:41.041 --> 05:43.508
Of everything that goes in
and out of our house.

05:43.510 --> 05:44.643
Now give me
nana's ring.
No.

05:44.645 --> 05:48.647
You said, one day,
I could give it to
the woman of my choosing,

05:48.649 --> 05:49.281
And I choose dana.

05:49.283 --> 05:52.718
By woman of your choosing,
I meant of our choosing.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.186
I'm a man,
I made this decision,

05:54.188 --> 05:56.788
And now there's nothing
that you can do about it.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.523
Oh, yes, there is.

05:58.525 --> 05:59.758
Hi, mrs. Goldberg.

05:59.760 --> 06:00.892
Dana, lovely to see you.

06:00.894 --> 06:02.594
I'm gonna need
that ring back.

06:02.596 --> 06:04.763
Mom, do not do this.

06:04.765 --> 06:05.864
Ring.
Do not.

06:05.866 --> 06:06.998
Ring, ring, ring.
Do not.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.168
Ring, ring. Who's there?
It's me. I want my ring back.

06:10.170 --> 06:11.503
Okay, I'll take it off.

06:11.505 --> 06:12.337
(ring clatters)

06:12.339 --> 06:15.207
Just put it back
on my finger
before you lose it.

06:15.209 --> 06:17.542
(laughing)
check it out.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.911
Goldnerd's proposing
to his mom,

06:19.913 --> 06:20.746
And she said yes!

06:20.748 --> 06:23.648
That's not what happened!
Oh, she said no.

06:23.650 --> 06:25.217
(all laughing)

06:25.219 --> 06:27.285
There. You're happy now?

06:27.287 --> 06:28.320
I do.

06:28.322 --> 06:30.122
I mean, I am.

06:33.926 --> 06:35.694
Hi, mr. Goldberg,
thanks for coming.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.162
My dad's excited
to meet you.

06:37.164 --> 06:38.230
Hi, barry.
Hey, hey.

06:38.232 --> 06:39.831
Oh, hey, there he is.
Hey, hey.

06:39.833 --> 06:40.999
Dad, you know barry,
mr. Goldberg.

06:41.001 --> 06:43.802
Yep. Hey,
bill lewis of bill lewis
tile and flooring.

06:43.804 --> 06:46.304
Murray goldberg
of this moron's father.

06:46.306 --> 06:48.840
(laughs)
classic mur-man.

06:48.842 --> 06:49.875
He kids.

06:49.877 --> 06:51.042
Big game today.

06:51.044 --> 06:51.676
You guys are lucky

06:51.678 --> 06:54.312
'cause I just bought
a brand-new big-screen tv
to watch it on.

06:54.314 --> 06:55.680
What you got, 27?
(whistles)

06:55.682 --> 06:56.915
32?
(imitates cranking)

06:56.917 --> 07:00.685
34?
53 inches of pure
magic, my friend.

07:00.687 --> 07:02.921
You are a dirty liar.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.122
Come here.
(chuckles)

07:04.124 --> 07:06.425
Oh...My...God.
It's real.

07:06.427 --> 07:09.027
(choir vocalizing)
adult adam: <i> Ah,</i>
<i> the '80s projection tv.</i>

07:09.029 --> 07:11.396
<i> It was blurry</i>
<i> and weighed more than a car,</i>

07:11.398 --> 07:14.032
<i> But it was the envy</i>
<i> of every man.</i>

07:14.034 --> 07:16.568
I know we just met...

07:16.570 --> 07:20.172
...But I want to live
with you, bill.
I choose you.

07:20.174 --> 07:21.306
Wow. I think this may work.

07:21.308 --> 07:23.442
<i> And it did,</i>
<i> for about two more seconds.</i>

07:23.444 --> 07:28.113
Murray, you can come over
for any game you want.

07:28.748 --> 07:32.684
(vocalizing stops)
everybody's welcome
in cowboy country.

07:35.221 --> 07:37.389
Good god.
What is this place?

07:37.391 --> 07:39.491
I think he said
cowboy country.

07:39.493 --> 07:41.359
Isn't it great?

07:43.463 --> 07:45.597
How could you
do this to me?

07:45.599 --> 07:46.264
They're cowboy fans.

07:46.266 --> 07:49.201
I can't watch
the biggest game
of the year

07:49.203 --> 07:50.101
In enemy territory!

07:50.103 --> 07:52.804
I'm sorry, okay?
Lainey didn't tell me.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.473
Lainey: I did. Remember?

07:54.475 --> 07:56.908
I told you all about it
in your room...

07:56.910 --> 07:57.609
When we were studying.

07:57.611 --> 08:02.414
You can't expect me
to listen to what
you're saying while we're...

08:02.416 --> 08:02.948
Studying.

08:02.950 --> 08:05.317
Morons! I know what
"studying" means!

08:05.319 --> 08:07.719
Look, you can still root
for the eagles,

08:07.721 --> 08:08.487
Just not out loud.

08:08.489 --> 08:12.023
Please. It's going so well.
My dad actually likes you.

08:12.025 --> 08:12.991
He never likes anyone.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.227
Fine. I will stay
for one quarter,

08:15.229 --> 08:18.763
But after that, I go home
and watch with my chair.

08:18.765 --> 08:20.432
Who wants
some barbecued eagle?

08:20.434 --> 08:23.201
(laughs) I'm just fooling.
It's chicken.

08:23.203 --> 08:25.337
But that's what
the eagles are, right?

08:25.339 --> 08:26.838
A bunch of chickens.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.306
(clucking)

08:28.308 --> 08:29.140
(laughs)

08:29.142 --> 08:30.575
Adult adam:
<i> As livid as my dad was,</i>

08:30.577 --> 08:34.312
<i> It didn't come close</i>
<i> to the rage in my heart.</i>

08:34.314 --> 08:35.647
Stop your stomping.

08:35.649 --> 08:37.382
I get it,
your little feet are mad,

08:37.384 --> 08:38.283
But you are
much too young

08:38.285 --> 08:41.019
To be giving little girls
big, honking sparklers.

08:41.021 --> 08:42.754
Fine! I'll just get her
a ring of my own!

08:42.756 --> 08:45.390
I'll mow every damn lawn
in this town if I have to.

08:45.392 --> 08:48.159
What do I need to score
a ring like that, huh?

08:48.161 --> 08:48.693
Ten, twelve g's?

08:48.695 --> 08:50.328
You know what? I thought
we were gonna be able

08:50.330 --> 08:51.563
To discuss this
like reasonable people,

08:51.565 --> 08:53.798
But clearly,
your little body's
all worked up.

08:53.800 --> 08:56.234
Stop calling
my parts little!

08:56.236 --> 08:57.836
I'm a man! A big man!

08:57.838 --> 08:58.470
Uh-huh!

08:58.472 --> 09:00.138
Well, you're grounded,
big man.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.574
That means no computer,
no television,

09:02.576 --> 09:04.709
No phone, no dana.

09:05.711 --> 09:06.177
(sighs)

09:06.179 --> 09:09.147
Don't look at me like that.
I know what you're thinking,

09:09.149 --> 09:12.717
But he crossed a line
with that ring.

09:12.719 --> 09:13.418
And don't tell me

09:13.420 --> 09:15.954
I'm trying to keep him
a baby forever

09:15.956 --> 09:16.488
Because I'm not,

09:16.490 --> 09:18.857
Although he is growing up
at an alarming rate.

09:18.859 --> 09:22.260
And this isn't because
I am devastated or jealous

09:22.262 --> 09:24.596
Or threatened that he's got
a new woman in his life,

09:24.598 --> 09:27.098
Because she is not a woman,
she is a girl

09:27.100 --> 09:29.467
And I am the woman.

09:29.469 --> 09:33.371
I'm his mother, of course,
but he's mine...

09:33.373 --> 09:35.040
Ours, all of ours.

09:35.042 --> 09:36.641
Shut up!

09:38.377 --> 09:40.011
(whirring)

09:40.013 --> 09:42.047
Hey. You okay?
No, I'm not okay!

09:42.049 --> 09:45.850
Dana's at the
water tower right now
with anthony balsamo.

09:45.852 --> 09:48.186
I can't let him swoop in
on my gal.

09:48.188 --> 09:48.954
I got to fix this.

09:48.956 --> 09:51.623
Oh, good, you came up
with another great way

09:51.625 --> 09:53.258
For a robot
to solve your problems.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.126
I will let love
and eight d batteries

09:55.128 --> 09:57.195
Carry my letter to dana
at the water tower.

09:57.197 --> 10:00.131
There's nothing that
can stand in omnibot's way.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.499
Nothing!

10:02.001 --> 10:03.068
Omnibot, no!

10:03.070 --> 10:05.937
You know grass
is your kryptonite!

10:06.305 --> 10:07.205
Well, here's an idea.

10:07.207 --> 10:09.140
A real man would
find dana himself.

10:09.142 --> 10:12.210
I can't. You heard mom,
she would ground me forever.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.613
Well, maybe some things
in life are just worth it.

10:14.615 --> 10:17.549
Adult adam: <i> In that moment,</i>
<i> I realized erica was right.</i>

10:17.551 --> 10:20.452
<i> It was time to stop letting</i>
<i> a robot do a man's job.</i>

10:20.454 --> 10:24.255
Run! Run and show her
what a man you are!

10:24.257 --> 10:26.825
What a tiny,
little man you are.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.326
And it's good!
(crowd cheering)

10:28.328 --> 10:29.828
Three on the board!

10:29.830 --> 10:31.830
Three on the board.
(bell rattles)

10:31.832 --> 10:34.566
Three on the board.
Three on the board.

10:34.568 --> 10:35.266
Sweet lord, make him stop.

10:35.268 --> 10:39.537
You know, dick vermeil
has no business coaching
men's football.

10:39.539 --> 10:42.507
Maybe, at best,
women's volleyball.

10:42.509 --> 10:43.208
Not the olympic kind.

10:43.210 --> 10:47.112
Like a casual,
two-woman game on a beach,
am I right, mur?

10:47.114 --> 10:48.847
Adult adam:
<i> After a quarter of agony,</i>

10:48.849 --> 10:51.316
<i> My dad was at</i>
<i> his breaking point,</i>

10:51.318 --> 10:53.351
<i> And then this happened.</i>

10:53.353 --> 10:55.186
Oh! Oh, yeah!
Mike quick!

10:55.188 --> 10:57.822
Just beat the kicker!
Just beat the kicker!

10:57.824 --> 11:00.191
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

11:00.193 --> 11:01.159
Touchdown!

11:01.161 --> 11:02.360
Oh, whoa, whoa!

11:02.362 --> 11:03.194
Oh, crap.

11:03.196 --> 11:04.496
We're done.
Yeah.

11:04.498 --> 11:05.196
You're an eagles fan?

11:05.198 --> 11:09.601
This is, uh, philadelphia,
and I root for two teams...

11:09.835 --> 11:10.268
The eagles

11:10.270 --> 11:12.037
And whoever's
playing the cowboys.

11:12.039 --> 11:15.740
But at least
we all can agree
the giants suck.

11:15.742 --> 11:16.207
Am I right?

11:16.209 --> 11:19.177
In my house,
we root for one team
and one team only.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.378
That's america's team.

11:20.380 --> 11:21.846
If anyone's america's team,
it's philly...

11:21.848 --> 11:25.483
Home of the liberty bell,
ben franklin, and <i> rocky</i> .

11:25.485 --> 11:27.385
Your city's so bad
you could only come up

11:27.387 --> 11:29.521
With is a mediocre
boxing movie

11:29.523 --> 11:30.088
And a broken bell.

11:30.090 --> 11:33.625
Okay, we're all
saying things that are
hurtful and untrue.

11:33.627 --> 11:34.492
I say we hug.

11:34.494 --> 11:36.227
We'll start.
You guys join.

11:36.229 --> 11:37.095
No.

11:37.097 --> 11:40.498
I never understood
why you liked this bonehead,

11:40.500 --> 11:43.868
But after meeting his dad,
I really don't get it.

11:43.870 --> 11:47.205
I don't have to sit here
and watch my son be insulted

11:47.207 --> 11:51.743
By a man who sells the
fourth-best type of flooring.

11:51.745 --> 11:54.379
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Oh, no.

11:54.381 --> 11:58.083
There's only one thing
worse than bad-mouthing
the cowboys,

11:58.085 --> 12:00.285
And that's talking nonsense
about tile.

12:00.287 --> 12:04.089
You can't name one better
flooring option!

12:04.091 --> 12:04.556
Not one!

12:04.558 --> 12:09.160
Carpet, wood, linoleum,
brick, marble, astroturf.

12:09.162 --> 12:10.495
Enough!

12:10.497 --> 12:11.429
It'll be a cold day in hell

12:11.431 --> 12:14.899
When my daughter dates
a no-good, tile-hating
eagle fan.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.167
I think you guys
should leave.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.937
I'm a step ahead of you!
Ca-caw!

12:18.939 --> 12:19.704
Stop it.
What is that?

12:19.706 --> 12:23.475
I am an eagle,
flying on my wings
to victory.

12:23.477 --> 12:24.609
Ca-caw!

12:24.611 --> 12:25.410
Eagles don't "ca-caw!"

12:25.412 --> 12:28.546
Nobody knows the sound
an eagle makes!

12:28.548 --> 12:30.281
(shouts) nobody!

12:30.883 --> 12:32.617
(door opens)

12:32.619 --> 12:33.718
Barry.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.220
Eagles don't ca-caw.

12:35.222 --> 12:35.954
Murray: Ca-caw!

12:35.956 --> 12:38.757
Adult adam:
<i> As barry was watching</i>
<i> his first love fly away,</i>

12:38.759 --> 12:40.892
<i> I was getting ready</i>
<i> to climb to new heights</i>

12:40.894 --> 12:42.961
<i> To show dana</i>
<i> what a man looked like.</i>

12:42.963 --> 12:44.662
Adam? I thought
you were grounded.

12:44.664 --> 12:47.465
This is how grounded
I'm not.

12:47.467 --> 12:48.099
(rattling)

12:48.101 --> 12:51.770
Wait. You can't climb that,
it's too dangerous.

12:51.772 --> 12:54.038
(crowd murmuring)

12:54.040 --> 12:58.143
Dana isabelle caldwell,
you're worth it.

12:59.645 --> 13:01.146
Adult adam:
<i> And so, my climb</i>
<i> into greatness began.</i>

13:01.148 --> 13:05.016
<i> Sure, I was a clumsy doof</i>
<i> with limited hand</i>
<i> and leg strength,</i>

13:05.018 --> 13:06.985
<i> But I wouldn't let</i>
<i> my shortcomings stop me.</i>

13:06.987 --> 13:09.587
<i> I had to show anthony balsamo</i>
<i> and the rest of my school</i>

13:09.589 --> 13:13.925
<i> That adam goldberg</i>
<i> was the manliest of men.</i>

13:14.093 --> 13:14.826
<i> It was my moment.</i>

13:14.828 --> 13:16.761
<i> The wind was at my back,</i>
<i> my heart was pounding,</i>

13:16.763 --> 13:18.596
<i> And I knew exactly</i>
<i> what I needed to write</i>

13:18.598 --> 13:23.168
<i> To show all of jenkintown</i>
<i> that dana was my girl.</i>

13:23.170 --> 13:26.171
<i> Nothing on god's green earth</i>
<i> could stop me.</i>

13:26.173 --> 13:27.272
No!

13:27.274 --> 13:29.007
Come on! Damn it!

13:29.009 --> 13:33.144
<i> Well, nothing,</i>
<i> except for an empty can</i>
<i> of spray paint.</i>

13:33.146 --> 13:34.946
Oh, balls!

13:36.248 --> 13:38.416
Do you know that guy,
dan?

13:38.418 --> 13:39.117
Not that well.

13:39.119 --> 13:41.152
Adult adam:
<i> Even more unfortunate...</i>

13:41.154 --> 13:41.786
Oh, balls!

13:41.788 --> 13:43.154
<i> I got so swept up</i>
<i> in being man</i>

13:43.156 --> 13:48.760
<i> That I'd forgotten</i>
<i> about my crippling</i>
<i> fear or heights.</i>

13:48.762 --> 13:49.327
(siren wails)

13:49.329 --> 13:53.565
<i> Also unfortunate,</i>
<i> they had to call</i>
<i> the fire department.</i>

13:53.567 --> 13:55.266
<i> Turns out,</i>
<i> being swaddled like a baby</i>

13:55.268 --> 13:59.170
<i> Didn't help my case</i>
<i> on proving my manhood.</i>

14:02.041 --> 14:03.408
Hey, you okay, bro?

14:03.410 --> 14:04.776
(bleep)  dan.

14:04.778 --> 14:08.546
Adult adam:
<i> Even though the eagles</i>
<i> lost pretty bad that day,</i>

14:08.548 --> 14:11.382
<i> Barry was taking his loss</i>
<i> even harder.</i>

14:11.384 --> 14:12.317
What the hell
are you doing?

14:12.319 --> 14:15.320
Just sorting
through the treasures
of our relationship.

14:15.322 --> 14:17.388
The flyer shirt
she hated,

14:17.390 --> 14:19.858
The stop sign
where she wanted to go left

14:19.860 --> 14:20.892
And I wanted to go right,

14:20.894 --> 14:22.927
So I got nervous,
went straight.

14:22.929 --> 14:26.264
You might not
understand this, but...

14:27.099 --> 14:30.301
Eagles and cowboys
just don't mix.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.704
You and lainey
were doomed from the start.

14:32.706 --> 14:34.239
We just root
for different teams.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.674
So what?
So it gets complicated.

14:36.676 --> 14:39.377
I've seen people try,
but it's, uh...

14:39.379 --> 14:40.712
Well, that's a tough life.

14:40.714 --> 14:42.113
You're living
in the past!

14:42.115 --> 14:44.182
I don't see teams,
I see people.

14:44.184 --> 14:45.316
Everyone sees teams.

14:45.318 --> 14:47.886
Well, as much as I care
about the eagles...

14:47.888 --> 14:49.454
I care about lainey more.

14:49.456 --> 14:52.290
That's a damn big thing
to say.

14:52.292 --> 14:54.826
I know it is.
You better mean it.

14:54.828 --> 14:55.693
I do.

14:55.695 --> 14:58.096
Well, let's get in
the damn car.

14:58.098 --> 14:59.230
And bring
the stop sign.

14:59.232 --> 15:02.033
We got to put it back.
It's a serious crime.

15:03.369 --> 15:04.736
Bill, we need to talk.

15:04.738 --> 15:06.004
I've got nothing
to say to you.

15:06.006 --> 15:08.506
Look, I know
things got personal.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.308
You said some things
about <i> rocky.</i>

15:10.310 --> 15:12.010
I said some things
about floor tiling.

15:12.012 --> 15:15.113
We got great kids,
and they like each other.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.148
So let's just
move past this.

15:17.150 --> 15:18.750
Mur, I'm a reasonable man.

15:18.752 --> 15:19.584
I'll let lainey see barry

15:19.586 --> 15:24.022
If you admit the cowboys
are america's team.

15:24.024 --> 15:24.489
Reasonable?

15:24.491 --> 15:26.958
That's not reasonable,
that's the opposite
of reasonable.

15:26.960 --> 15:30.161
Dad, come on.
Let him try it on.

15:30.163 --> 15:32.764
I'll do it.
Wait, seriously?

15:32.766 --> 15:34.032
(sighs)

15:34.034 --> 15:36.734
(mumbling)
the cowboys are...
What's that?

15:36.736 --> 15:37.669
Cowboys...
(speaks gibberish)

15:37.671 --> 15:39.604
I couldn't quite
hear you.
Cowboys... (mumbles)

15:39.606 --> 15:42.974
Adult adam:
<i> Even though my brother liked</i>
<i> lainey more than the eagles,</i>

15:42.976 --> 15:45.777
<i> He hated watching</i>
<i> our dad get ridiculed.</i>

15:45.779 --> 15:47.979
The cowboys...

15:47.981 --> 15:48.413
Suck!

15:48.415 --> 15:50.648
They suck!
The cowboys suck!

15:50.650 --> 15:53.651
I'm sorry, lainey,
they suck so hard.

15:53.653 --> 15:54.552
I think we're done here.

15:54.554 --> 15:57.755
Damn right we are! Ca-caw!
Ca-caw!

15:57.757 --> 15:58.356
Stop it!
Ca-caw!

15:58.358 --> 15:59.791
Eagles don't make
that noise!

15:59.793 --> 16:01.526
Ca-caw!
It makes no sense!

16:01.528 --> 16:02.360
Both: Ca-caw! Ca-caw!

16:02.362 --> 16:03.962
Adult adam:
<i> While barry and my dad</i>
<i> were flying high,</i>

16:03.964 --> 16:06.030
<i> Erica was trying to keep</i>
<i> my smother grounded.</i>

16:06.032 --> 16:07.799
Where is he?
Where is my boy?

16:07.801 --> 16:09.334
I'm sorry.
I can't hear you.

16:09.336 --> 16:11.102
Tell me
where my favorite child is,

16:11.104 --> 16:13.004
Or this is gonna get
real mean.

16:13.006 --> 16:14.672
Meaner than that?
Cut it out.

16:14.674 --> 16:16.140
Do what you will,
I won't crack.

16:16.142 --> 16:18.776
Wow. Standing up
for your brother.

16:18.778 --> 16:21.045
I'm proud of you, really.

16:21.814 --> 16:22.413
What are you doing?

16:22.415 --> 16:25.249
Just demonstrating
how I'll be showing up
to school next year

16:25.251 --> 16:26.150
If you don't start talking.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.686
(scoffs) you think
a few curlers scare me?

16:28.688 --> 16:31.289
Wow. You put those in fast,
you're like a hair ninja.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.524
Oh, it won't just
be curlers.

16:33.526 --> 16:36.761
It'll be the whole
pre-bedtime routine.

16:37.896 --> 16:40.531
(lisping) hi, erica,
it's me, your mother.

16:40.533 --> 16:43.434
He's at the water tower.
You're weak.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.303
I know.

16:51.543 --> 16:52.810
Hey!

16:52.812 --> 16:54.912
You are in
so much trouble, mister!

16:54.914 --> 16:56.614
You thought
you were grounded before?

16:56.616 --> 16:58.850
Well, you are
really grounded now.

16:58.852 --> 16:59.650
It doesn't matter!

16:59.652 --> 17:04.355
After tonight,
dana will never want
to see me again anyway.

17:05.324 --> 17:06.958
What happened?

17:06.960 --> 17:08.026
You were right.

17:08.028 --> 17:08.760
I'm a little boy,

17:08.762 --> 17:10.695
And every time
I try and be a man,

17:10.697 --> 17:15.033
I just end up proving
I'm the farthest thing
from it.

17:15.401 --> 17:16.234
I just...

17:16.236 --> 17:17.935
I hate who I am right now.

17:17.937 --> 17:19.370
Don't say that.

17:19.372 --> 17:22.140
Look, I know this is hard
for you to understand,

17:22.142 --> 17:25.043
But this period
of your life...
(clicks tongue)

17:25.045 --> 17:27.311
It's only gonna last
a little while.

17:27.313 --> 17:31.682
I'm sure, for you,
it seems like
it'll last forever,

17:31.684 --> 17:35.953
But believe me,
it doesn't.

17:37.089 --> 17:37.955
In fact, for me,

17:37.957 --> 17:41.626
It all seems like
it's just going by so fast.

17:41.628 --> 17:42.827
Just take me home.

17:42.829 --> 17:46.030
(dire straits
<i> romeo and juliet</i> plays)

17:54.573 --> 17:56.707
(brakes squeal)

17:56.709 --> 17:59.077
Okay. Here's your stop.

17:59.411 --> 18:01.245
But this is
dana's house.

18:01.247 --> 18:02.413
Yeah. Go talk to her.

18:02.415 --> 18:06.317
Really? You said
I wasn't allowed
to see her anymore.

18:06.319 --> 18:08.486
I know what I said.

18:08.488 --> 18:09.854
Go.

18:12.691 --> 18:15.560
<i> ¶ a lovestruck romeo</i>

18:15.562 --> 18:18.396
<i> ¶ sings the streets</i>
<i> a serenade</i>

18:18.398 --> 18:21.065
<i> ¶ laying everybody low</i>

18:21.067 --> 18:24.001
<i> ¶ with a love song</i>
<i> that he made</i>

18:24.003 --> 18:26.037
<i> ¶ finds a streetlight</i>

18:26.039 --> 18:28.406
<i> ¶ steps out of the shade</i>

18:28.408 --> 18:30.108
<i> ¶ says something like... ¶</i>

18:30.110 --> 18:31.976
Adam?
We need to talk.

18:31.978 --> 18:33.578
Okay, I'll come down.

18:33.580 --> 18:34.712
No, wait.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.647
I'll come up.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.417
Adult adam: <i> That night,</i>
<i> I was determined</i>

18:39.419 --> 18:40.985
<i> To climb my way</i>
<i> into manhood.</i>

18:40.987 --> 18:42.720
<i> Or at least make it</i>
<i> to dana's window</i>

18:42.722 --> 18:44.856
<i> Without having</i>
<i> to be rescued</i>
<i> by firemen.</i>

18:44.858 --> 18:46.691
You know, you really need
to stop climbing things.

18:46.693 --> 18:50.695
Look, all I wanted
was to be seen
as your boyfriend,

18:50.697 --> 18:52.563
Not some little kid.

18:52.565 --> 18:53.297
No one thinks that.

18:53.299 --> 18:55.833
Of course they do.
Look at me.

18:55.835 --> 18:57.635
Adam, look at me.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.070
People think
I'm in high school,

18:59.072 --> 19:01.272
And they stare at me,
and it sucks.

19:01.274 --> 19:03.107
I don't want to go
to their parties.

19:03.109 --> 19:07.111
I just want to ride my bike
and play video games...

19:07.779 --> 19:09.046
With you.

19:09.048 --> 19:12.817
(chuckles)
that sounds awesome.

19:12.951 --> 19:15.520
So, now what?

19:16.421 --> 19:18.556
Now I kiss you?

19:19.024 --> 19:21.058
I'm good with that.

19:22.861 --> 19:25.863
I can't believe you were
actually gonna say

19:25.865 --> 19:27.098
The cowboys were better
than the eagles for me.

19:27.100 --> 19:30.334
For your information,
I was never going
to say that.

19:30.336 --> 19:33.104
Oh, you were
gonna say it.
I wasn't going to say it.

19:33.106 --> 19:33.804
You were gonna say it.

19:33.806 --> 19:37.008
Okay, maybe I like you
a little bit more
than the eagles.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.876
Don't tell the eagles.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.845
(knocking on door)

19:41.947 --> 19:43.548
Lainey, what are you...

19:43.550 --> 19:44.448
My dad hates your guts.

19:44.450 --> 19:45.850
Oh, my god,
he hates you so much.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.285
He forbid me from
ever seeing you again.

19:47.287 --> 19:49.921
Well, thanks for delivering
that message in person.

19:49.923 --> 19:51.389
Don't you get it?

19:51.391 --> 19:52.156
He forbid me.

19:52.158 --> 19:54.091
Forbidden love!
That is so hot!
Huh?

19:54.093 --> 19:57.228
Oh, can't you guys just wait
until I leave the room

19:57.230 --> 19:59.297
Before you start studying?

19:59.299 --> 20:00.731
Ugh. I just ate.

20:00.733 --> 20:03.034
Oh, and by the way,

20:03.036 --> 20:05.703
Even though
the cowboys suck...

20:05.705 --> 20:08.372
I think
barry chose well.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.541
I chose him.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.076
Hmm.

20:12.711 --> 20:15.012
<i> ¶ all I do is kiss you</i>

20:15.014 --> 20:17.782
<i> ¶ through the bars of a rhyme</i>

20:17.784 --> 20:22.186
<i> ¶ julie, I'd do the stars</i>
<i> with you any time ¶</i>

20:24.289 --> 20:25.423
It's my green lantern ring.

20:25.425 --> 20:29.560
It's actually
not worth anything, but...
I love it.

20:30.295 --> 20:32.630
Adult adam:
<i> That's the thing</i>
<i> about young love.</i>

20:32.632 --> 20:36.434
<i> It's weird, it's awkward,</i>
<i> it's confusing as hell,</i>

20:36.436 --> 20:40.638
<i> But no matter what size</i>
<i> you are, it's worth it.</i>

20:47.446 --> 20:49.213
(bell dinging)

20:52.884 --> 20:54.819
Holy why?

20:54.821 --> 20:55.786
Hi, erica.

20:55.788 --> 20:56.654
Okay, fine!
You got me!

20:56.656 --> 20:58.823
But I was only
in atlantic city
for a few hours,

20:58.825 --> 21:00.458
And I wasn't even
with those dudes

21:00.460 --> 21:01.325
When they were arrested.

21:01.327 --> 21:03.027
Adam forgot his lunch.
I just brought it to him.

21:03.029 --> 21:06.163
You said
you would come to school...

21:06.231 --> 21:08.466
I thought you knew.
I didn't.

21:08.468 --> 21:09.467
Then why are you here

21:09.469 --> 21:10.901
Dressed as
my worst nightmare?

21:10.903 --> 21:11.736
'cause some mornings,

21:11.738 --> 21:14.105
It's just tougher to get it
together than others.

21:14.107 --> 21:16.474
Now, moving on
to your punishment?

21:16.476 --> 21:18.643
Oh, I love you, too,
erica!

21:18.645 --> 21:21.612
Yes, this is my daughter!

21:21.614 --> 21:23.981
I baked her in my tummy!
