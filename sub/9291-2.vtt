00:21.120 --> 00:22.800
- Excuse me, Miss Driscoll.
- What is it, Chloe?

00:22.880 --> 00:26.480
Intelligence indicated the possibility
of an attack at eight this morning.

00:26.560 --> 00:31.440
A Turkish national on the FBI watch list,
Tomas Sherek, was last seen in the city.

00:31.520 --> 00:32.680
It's Tomas.

00:32.759 --> 00:36.120
- Did Dar get the briefcase?
- Yes. He's on his way to you now.

00:36.520 --> 00:39.320
So far, everything is on schedule.

00:39.400 --> 00:42.800
The briefcase is on its way. When it gets here,
you'll take it to the warehouse.

00:42.880 --> 00:45.520
What we will accomplish today
will change the world.

00:45.600 --> 00:48.880
We're fortunate that our family
has been chosen to do this.

00:49.320 --> 00:52.560
I found something on the Net
I think you should know about.

00:52.640 --> 00:55.960
I think someone's positioning code
for a major Internet attack.

00:56.040 --> 00:58.480
The thing is, not all
the code remarks are in English.

00:58.560 --> 01:01.240
- What language were they in?
- Arabic or Turkish, maybe.

01:01.320 --> 01:03.200
" What did you find?

01:03.280 --> 01:05.960
- It was my friend, not me.
- What's his name?

01:06.040 --> 01:09.200
Andrew Paige.

01:12.400 --> 01:15.320
- Is it gonna be uncomfortable?
- What?

01:15.400 --> 01:17.880
Going back to CTU. Seeing Driscoll again.

01:17.960 --> 01:21.520
- I don't blame her for her decision.
- She forced you out of CTU.

01:21.600 --> 01:26.160
I could have joined other agencies
if I still wanted to do field work. But I didn't.

01:26.240 --> 01:29.000
- I know this guy.
- Fortunately for you, Jack,

01:29.080 --> 01:30.600
it's our problem, not yours.

01:30.680 --> 01:33.880
Erin, listen to me. This doesn't make sense.

01:33.960 --> 01:38.320
He wouldn't risk exposing himself here in the
US for a train bombing. It's not big enough.

01:38.400 --> 01:40.720
We'll consider that when we interrogate him.

01:40.800 --> 01:46.720
I am not messing with you. You are gonna
tell me. What is happening at eight o'clock?

01:47.960 --> 01:51.080
- Jack!
- What is your primary objective?

01:51.160 --> 01:53.360
Secretary of Defense!

01:54.240 --> 01:55.400
Heller.

01:55.480 --> 01:57.920
Did it ever occur to you
that these people are using you?

01:58.000 --> 02:03.720
Don't you realise they're letting you speak
for one reason? Because you are my son!

02:03.920 --> 02:06.400
Audrey, it's Jack. Are you still at Richard's?

02:06.480 --> 02:10.320
Get your father out of there now!
Your father is the real target.

02:10.400 --> 02:12.560
Oh, my God.

02:15.840 --> 02:17.040
Jack!

02:18.080 --> 02:19.440
Audrey?

02:21.320 --> 02:23.200
Audrey!

02:52.360 --> 02:54.360
Richard Heller?

02:56.440 --> 02:58.800
They took my father and my sister.

03:05.840 --> 03:08.120
Come on!

03:33.520 --> 03:37.040
It's been over five minutes.
You need to widen your perimeter.

03:37.120 --> 03:42.360
You're not listening to me. I'm not interested
in local law enforcement. Get Secret Service.

03:42.440 --> 03:44.800
- Good. Get back to me.
- " Everyone.

03:44.880 --> 03:47.280
Everyone, please listen up.

03:48.360 --> 03:51.760
Secretary of Defense Heller
was abducted a few minutes ago,

03:51.840 --> 03:55.560
along with his senior policy analyst,
Audrey Raines.

03:55.640 --> 03:58.200
He was at his son Richard's house
when he was taken.

03:58.280 --> 04:03.040
LAPD is bringing Richard in for questioning.
This is a top-priority situation.

04:03.120 --> 04:07.280
I want all interagency protocols
activated immediately.

04:08.960 --> 04:12.280
Move off that page.
Link up to the Secret Service channel.

04:12.360 --> 04:15.000
- It's not that simple. We're locked out.
- Why?

04:15.080 --> 04:18.920
- They're sequestering the cabinet.
- Driscoll wants the protocols activated.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.520
- What do you want me to do?
- Break through those channels. Hack in.

04:24.600 --> 04:28.040
Chloe, move everything from the bombing
to the secondary server.

04:28.120 --> 04:32.120
- I did that already.
- Then sync up the kidnapping and bombing.

04:32.200 --> 04:36.840
I did that too, but I haven't opened a pipe to
the Army Criminal Investigation Division yet.

04:36.920 --> 04:39.160
- Do it.
- On my way to.

04:39.240 --> 04:43.160
I'm looking at it. They widened the perimeter.
Any ID on transportation?

04:43.240 --> 04:46.320
- " I'm working on it..."
- I'm gonna have to get back to you.

04:46.400 --> 04:49.520
- I need to speak to you.
- You're done here. I'm detaining you.

04:49.600 --> 04:55.000
Erin, listen! Heller is my responsibility. I need
you to reinstate me on a provisional basis

04:55.080 --> 04:58.640
- until I get him back.
- You don't give me orders, Jack.

04:58.720 --> 05:02.320
I'm detaining you until an investigator
can take your statement.

05:02.400 --> 05:07.040
I'll recommend you're arrested for torturing
a suspect and rendering him useless.

05:07.120 --> 05:10.760
You were getting nowhere.
Because of me, Sherek told you all he knows.

05:10.840 --> 05:13.600
You'd better hope so.

05:13.680 --> 05:17.520
Would you please escort Mr Bauer
to a vacant office until Division gets here?

05:17.600 --> 05:20.760
I'm fine. You're making a mistake.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.640
Excuse me. President Keeler.

05:23.720 --> 05:26.240
- What about him?
- He wants to talk to you.

05:26.320 --> 05:28.080
All right.

05:31.960 --> 05:36.880
- This is Erin Driscoll.
- " Please hold for the president."

05:36.960 --> 05:39.400
Tell me about the attack on the secretary.

05:39.480 --> 05:42.520
We know that he was taken
approximately ten minutes ago.

05:42.600 --> 05:47.000
- You had any contact from the kidnappers?
- No, sir. We have not.

05:47.080 --> 05:50.480
How is it that Secret Service
wasn't able to protect him?

05:50.560 --> 05:53.440
I understand that
he broke his schedule to visit his son.

05:53.520 --> 05:56.480
Somehow, the kidnappers
had access to that information.

05:56.560 --> 05:59.320
We're looking into that now.

05:59.400 --> 06:03.560
All right. We're going to go
to an elevated level of security.

06:03.640 --> 06:06.600
- Take the appropriate measures.
- "I understand."

06:06.680 --> 06:09.600
- Get them back, Erin.
- We're doing everything we can, sir.

06:13.520 --> 06:14.920
- Hello.
- Mom?

06:15.000 --> 06:17.360
- "Hi, sweetie. I didn't..."
- Mom, listen.

06:17.440 --> 06:20.280
- Get out of the house now.
- What are you talking about?

06:20.360 --> 06:23.280
Someone's looking for me
and they might come for you next.

06:23.360 --> 06:28.000
- What kind of trouble are you in?
- I don't know. I found something on the Net.

06:28.080 --> 06:31.600
- Now these people are after me.
- Andrew, you are being paranoid.

06:31.680 --> 06:35.920
Mom, they killed Melanie.
They killed everybody in the office.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.960
- What?
- They shot 'em. Mom, I'm really scared.

06:40.040 --> 06:43.160
Oh, my God. I'm gonna call the police.

06:43.240 --> 06:48.000
Just get outta there! Get to one of your
friends' houses and stay there! Go! Go now!

06:48.080 --> 06:49.880
Andrew!

07:15.720 --> 07:20.440
- I said Driscoll wanted me to question you.
- What's going on? What are you doing?

07:20.920 --> 07:23.360
I'll probably get in trouble, but I don't care.

07:23.440 --> 07:26.480
- I may have a way to find Heller.
- Why are you telling me?

07:26.560 --> 07:32.560
I don't think Driscoll's handling this
the right way and I don't trust her, I trust you.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.720
Sit down.

07:39.680 --> 07:43.440
A friend of mine called about 40 minutes ago,
someone I went to school with.

07:43.520 --> 07:46.720
- He wouldn't call me unless it was serious.
- What is it?

07:46.800 --> 07:49.600
He noticed computer code
planted on the Internet.

07:49.680 --> 07:53.800
- How is that connected to Heller?
- It originated in Turkey, like everything else,

07:53.880 --> 07:57.120
- Sherek, the train bombing.
- Where is your friend now?

08:05.640 --> 08:10.080
You can see them taking Secretary
Heller's son away from the scene now.

08:10.160 --> 08:14.320
That's being done for his own protection,
according to police sources.

08:14.400 --> 08:22.280
Those same sources tell us that at least
five Secret Service agents were shot...

08:24.240 --> 08:26.400
- Hello.
- " Andrew, it's me."

08:26.480 --> 08:30.400
- What did you do, Chloe? Who did you tell?
- What do you mean?

08:30.480 --> 08:34.840
Everyone's dead. They're dead.
Now they're trying to kill me.

08:34.919 --> 08:39.880
- Talk to me. Who's dead? What happened?
- Everyone's dead. They're dead.

08:39.960 --> 08:42.799
After I called you, I went back to my office.

08:42.880 --> 08:45.360
There was a guy there torturing Melanie.

08:45.440 --> 08:48.840
He wanted to know
who hacked into their system.

08:48.920 --> 08:50.560
And then he shot her.

08:50.640 --> 08:52.520
Oh, my God.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.760
- Who shot her?
- Who's this?

08:54.840 --> 08:57.560
Jack Bauer.
I work for Secretary of Defense Heller.

08:57.640 --> 09:00.360
- Andrew, we need your help.
- What?

09:00.440 --> 09:03.080
Heller was kidnapped
less than half an hour ago.

09:03.160 --> 09:06.720
I believe the same people
that kidnapped him are chasing you now.

09:06.800 --> 09:10.160
- "I don't know anything."
- "Son, you've been targeted for a reason."

09:10.240 --> 09:13.040
You know more than you think.

09:14.840 --> 09:17.040
- What do I do?
- "Where are you?"

09:17.120 --> 09:20.000
I'm at Union Station. I'm getting outta town.

09:20.080 --> 09:25.800
No. You stay put. The best thing
you can do right now is let me bring you in.

09:25.880 --> 09:29.040
- Chloe, what should I do?
- You can trust Jack.

09:32.240 --> 09:33.840
OK.

09:33.920 --> 09:36.960
I'll be next to track three
at the bottom of the ramp.

09:37.040 --> 09:39.440
Andrew, what are you wearing?

09:40.280 --> 09:45.440
Blue jeans, brown jacket and a black bag.

09:45.520 --> 09:49.880
OK, you stay put.
I'll be there in about 30 minutes.

09:49.960 --> 09:51.360
OK.

09:52.720 --> 09:57.840
This is all my fault. I shouldn't have let
Driscoll talk me in to handing it to the FBI.

09:57.920 --> 10:01.560
- She did what?
- She told me to give it to the FBI.

10:23.840 --> 10:26.800
- " Yes."
- I found out who stumbled onto our server.

10:26.880 --> 10:30.000
- Is he with you now?
- No. I'll have him shortly.

10:30.080 --> 10:33.920
- Find out who he's talked to.
- Of course.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.800
- And then kill him.
- Yeah.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.160
- Is everything in there?
- Yes.

10:47.240 --> 10:51.120
- Where's Behrooz?
- Upstairs, checking traffic on line.

10:51.200 --> 10:54.320
It's almost time for him to go.

10:54.400 --> 10:58.360
Are you sure you don't want me
to take the briefcase to Omar?

10:58.440 --> 11:02.280
The plan is in place. I don't want to deviate.

11:03.440 --> 11:04.720
Why?

11:04.800 --> 11:07.880
This is the key
to everything we're doing today.

11:07.960 --> 11:10.320
It's a lot to entrust to a teenager.

11:10.400 --> 11:14.160
I told you. Our whereabouts
have to be accounted for today.

11:14.240 --> 11:20.080
Besides, it's because he's a teenager
that he won't arouse suspicion.

11:20.160 --> 11:22.000
You're right.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.160
Don't worry, Dina.

11:28.240 --> 11:30.640
We prepared well for today.

11:31.160 --> 11:35.000
The train. The kidnapping.
It's all gone as expected.

11:35.640 --> 11:38.640
I spoke with Omar. He's happy.

11:40.800 --> 11:44.960
And he knows Behrooz is the one
who will deliver the device?

11:45.040 --> 11:47.040
Yes, he knows.

11:52.840 --> 11:55.440
Behrooz will be fine.

12:01.720 --> 12:07.200
We're looking to find a connection between
the bombing and Heller's abduction. Sarah.

12:07.280 --> 12:11.520
NTSB has given us a full passenger list.
We're processing those names now.

12:11.600 --> 12:15.320
What about Heller's son? Is it possible
he had something to do with this?

12:15.400 --> 12:19.600
We're not counting anything out.
He's being brought here for questioning now.

12:19.680 --> 12:23.240
Erin, I need to speak with you.
Privately, please.

12:23.320 --> 12:26.560
- You're testing me, Jack.
- Erin, please.

12:28.840 --> 12:34.840
Curtis will hand out assignment protocols.
I want status reports every 15 minutes.

12:44.360 --> 12:49.480
I have information you ignored that seems to
be connected to the bombing and kidnapping.

12:49.560 --> 12:52.560
- What information?
- A computer programmer, Andrew Paige,

12:52.640 --> 12:55.600
accidentally came across
a possible Internet strike.

12:55.680 --> 12:59.280
- I know. It was passed on to the FBI.
- Yes. Against CTU protocol.

12:59.360 --> 13:03.040
You abandoned an active investigation
during a terrorist strike.

13:03.120 --> 13:06.400
I got confirmation from the LAPD
that Andrew Paige's co-workers

13:06.480 --> 13:10.280
were all found dead less than 20 minutes ago.

13:10.360 --> 13:13.200
I'll coordinate with FBI
and we'll investigate that.

13:13.280 --> 13:16.960
No, you won't. I talked to the kid.
I'm the only one who knows where he is.

13:17.040 --> 13:21.240
You want that kid picked up,
you're gonna have to reinstate me.

13:21.320 --> 13:25.920
- I'm having you locked up for impeding me.
- You do that and I'll tell the president

13:26.000 --> 13:30.280
that you had Sherek in custody over half
an hour before Heller was even kidnapped,

13:30.360 --> 13:33.520
and you couldn't break him, I did.

13:35.280 --> 13:37.560
Are you threatening me, Jack?

13:38.440 --> 13:42.920
I am asking you to let me
help rescue Secretary Heller.

13:59.080 --> 14:02.000
This is how it's gonna work.

14:02.080 --> 14:06.160
I'll reinstate your commission
on a temporary basis until Heller is safe.

14:06.240 --> 14:08.760
You will not make any unilateral decisions.

14:08.840 --> 14:13.440
You will work as an auxiliary agent
under the authority of Ronnie Lobell.

14:13.520 --> 14:17.400
And then I'll hand you over to Division.

15:29.160 --> 15:31.160
- What are they gonna do?
- I don't know,

15:31.240 --> 15:35.000
but if they wanted me dead,
they would have killed me at Richard's house.

15:35.080 --> 15:37.120
Richard. God.

15:37.200 --> 15:40.400
He was still in the house.
I don't think they went in there.

15:40.480 --> 15:43.920
Listen to me, Audy.
No matter what happens to me,

15:44.000 --> 15:47.320
they have no reason to hurt you.

15:47.400 --> 15:51.000
- They don't need a reason.
- And I don't want you to give 'em one.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.120
Do what they say.

15:53.200 --> 15:56.360
Whatever happens to me, don't provoke them.

15:56.440 --> 16:01.760
If they threaten me, if they hurt me,
even if they kill me...

16:01.840 --> 16:04.240
do what they say.

16:13.680 --> 16:15.840
I only asked for Heller.

16:15.920 --> 16:19.360
I didn't want to kill her
without your permission.

16:21.560 --> 16:24.760
- Dad!
- Leave her alone! Don't you touch her!

16:24.840 --> 16:27.680
- So help me God, I will kill you!
- Dad!

16:27.760 --> 16:32.000
- Son of a bitch! I'll kill you!
- Omar! Yes or no?

16:32.080 --> 16:35.200
Do not do this! Leave her alone.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.120
Not yet.

16:48.160 --> 16:51.640
We may be able to use her.

16:52.480 --> 16:54.680
Take them away.

16:54.760 --> 16:56.760
Dad. Dad.

17:08.720 --> 17:11.119
I'm going with Ronnie to pick up Andrew.

17:11.200 --> 17:13.200
- Has Driscoll cleared you?
- Yeah.

17:13.280 --> 17:17.040
That's unlike her. I hope you didn't
tell her I gave you the information.

17:17.119 --> 17:21.119
I didn't. Have we heard anything from
any agents that survived the kidnapping?

17:21.200 --> 17:24.079
- There's one. He's in surgery.
- Any other witnesses?

17:24.160 --> 17:27.040
The son, Richard.
They're bringing him in now.

17:27.119 --> 17:30.320
Get back to me as soon as you've got
anything on Heller or Audrey.

17:30.400 --> 17:35.240
Sure. Bad luck about Audrey being there
when her dad got kidnapped.

17:35.320 --> 17:37.120
Yeah.

17:40.480 --> 17:43.880
I'm going to my car to get my things.

17:43.960 --> 17:46.120
OK, so let me understand this.

17:46.200 --> 17:49.520
Bauer illegally shoots a suspect
and you let him back in the field?

17:49.600 --> 17:53.360
He'll only give us the location
if I let him work it.

17:53.440 --> 17:59.000
- He can't hold back information, Erin.
- We don't have time to interrogate him.

17:59.520 --> 18:02.440
It's a simple job.
You pick up the subject and bring him in.

18:02.520 --> 18:06.960
Bauer has not been in the field for
a year and a half. That has consequences...

18:07.040 --> 18:13.160
Which is why I need you to keep him
on a tight leash. It's not optional, it's an order.

18:13.240 --> 18:14.680
Fine.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.000
I'm ready to go.

18:32.880 --> 18:37.560
This is a simple task, Behrooz. But these
are the ones where mistakes can be made.

18:37.640 --> 18:42.400
Drive carefully. If there is anyone
in the area who looks suspicious,

18:42.480 --> 18:45.560
drive away and call us. Understood?

18:46.560 --> 18:48.440
Yes.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.920
- Hello.
- Mrs Araz, this is Debbie.

18:57.680 --> 19:00.400
Yes, Debbie, what can I do for you?

19:00.480 --> 19:05.360
- Can I please talk to Behrooz?
- Let me see if he's here. Hold on.

19:07.280 --> 19:10.680
- What does she want?
- I don't know.

19:10.760 --> 19:11.760
Debbie?

19:11.840 --> 19:14.960
I've left messages on your cellphone.
Why haven't you called?

19:15.040 --> 19:17.920
- I'm sorry, I've been busy.
- Doing what?

19:19.560 --> 19:22.320
Working for my father.

19:23.160 --> 19:27.720
I don't believe you. If you're seeing someone
else, at least have the decency to tell me.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.960
I'm not seeing anyone else.

19:30.040 --> 19:32.520
- Then why are you avoiding me?
- I'm not.

19:33.680 --> 19:38.120
- This isn't the right time to do this.
- That's what I mean. You're still avoiding me.

19:38.200 --> 19:40.200
I'm not.

19:40.280 --> 19:43.000
Then why can't we talk now?

19:43.080 --> 19:45.280
Because I can't.

19:45.360 --> 19:48.080
- I've gotta go.
- Behrooz!

19:51.200 --> 19:53.000
Behrooz.

19:54.120 --> 19:57.080
That's not the right way
to deal with this situation.

19:57.160 --> 20:01.920
This girl needs to know it's over
and that there will be no more phone calls.

20:02.000 --> 20:07.480
I'll take care of it later.
I don't wanna be late getting this to Omar.

20:17.360 --> 20:20.400
- You sent Jack Bauer out in the field?
- He'll be with Ronnie.

20:20.480 --> 20:23.240
- Yeah, but why?
- He knows our procedures.

20:23.320 --> 20:26.360
And he may have information about Heller.
What is it, Chloe?

20:26.440 --> 20:31.520
Curtis, you wanted to know when Richard
Heller arrived. He's on his way to Holding.

20:31.600 --> 20:34.880
Thanks. Do you want me
to choreograph the jurisdictions?

20:34.960 --> 20:40.920
No, I'll do it. Find out what the son knows.
Chloe, I'd like to talk to you.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.720
Has it occurred to you
that we might be farther along

20:44.800 --> 20:47.680
if you trusted me
half as much as you trust Jack Bauer?

20:47.760 --> 20:52.160
Miss Driscoll, I'm not in the mood to play
the scared student at the principal's office.

20:52.240 --> 20:55.440
I came to you with information
that my friend Andrew gave to me

20:55.520 --> 20:58.240
and you chose to not respond to it.

20:58.320 --> 21:03.120
When you came to me with the information,
we were looking for Sherek, were we not?

21:03.200 --> 21:06.440
- Yes.
- Wasn't he our most important lead then?

21:06.520 --> 21:09.640
- I guess.
- Then my question to you is...

21:09.720 --> 21:15.680
once we had Sherek in custody, if you felt
that your Internet lead was still valuable,

21:15.760 --> 21:18.360
why didn't you reprise it?

21:20.320 --> 21:23.600
You're right.
I felt more comfortable going to Jack.

21:23.680 --> 21:26.480
Well, at least that's honest.

21:29.800 --> 21:32.600
You can go back to work now.

21:43.040 --> 21:45.160
Check that, please.

21:46.880 --> 21:50.400
For the record, I think Driscoll
made a mistake letting you come.

21:50.480 --> 21:53.440
- All right.
- And just so we're clear, I give the orders.

21:53.520 --> 21:56.840
I'm fine with that. What happened
earlier in Holding with Sherek,

21:56.920 --> 21:59.760
I had intel and had no time
to do it another way. I'm sorry.

21:59.840 --> 22:05.760
Apology accepted. But if you try to exceed
my authority again, I will stop you cold.

22:26.040 --> 22:30.880
Fine. Have Marcy isolate all the death threats
Heller's received over the last six months.

22:30.960 --> 22:35.640
I want phone calls, emails, snail mail,
everything sent over to CTU for analysis.

22:35.720 --> 22:38.400
Well, for the time being,
I'm working with them.

22:38.480 --> 22:41.560
Yeah. OK, good, thanks.

22:42.760 --> 22:48.160
- Has Heller had a lot of death threats lately?
- No more than anyone else in the cabinet.

22:50.520 --> 22:53.040
So what's it like working in DC?

22:53.120 --> 22:57.840
For the most part, we solve problems
in theory that'll never come into play.

22:57.920 --> 23:01.000
- Then why do it?
- I've got my reasons.

23:03.040 --> 23:07.440
Hey, man. I'm just trying
to make some conversation.

23:09.240 --> 23:13.720
I read your file. It must have really
burned you up when Driscoll fired you.

23:13.800 --> 23:16.280
She did me a favour.
I wanted to get my life back.

23:16.360 --> 23:19.560
I wouldn't have been able to
if I was still doing field work.

23:19.640 --> 23:23.400
How's the master plan going?
Do you have a life yet?

23:27.320 --> 23:28.720
Yeah.

23:31.520 --> 23:33.920
Yeah, I got a life.

23:43.320 --> 23:47.360
We'll be fine, Audy.
We're still on US soil.

23:47.440 --> 23:52.720
That's not gonna help us
if this is some sort of suicide mission.

23:53.520 --> 23:56.360
You said Jack tried to warn you
before they grabbed us.

23:56.440 --> 23:59.520
Yeah. That's right.

23:59.600 --> 24:05.800
That means he must have a reliable source,
which means our chances are good.

24:14.440 --> 24:16.640
Audy, sit down.

24:20.280 --> 24:24.080
I am your father.
Do you trust me?

24:24.160 --> 24:26.440
- Of course I do.
- Then listen.

24:26.520 --> 24:31.000
You cannot allow a negative thought
to enter your head now.

24:31.080 --> 24:35.240
They will find us.
We will be rescued. Say it.

24:35.320 --> 24:40.000
- Please, Dad, don't.
- We will be rescued. Say it, Audy.

24:42.960 --> 24:46.240
- We will be rescued.
- We will be rescued.

25:04.800 --> 25:06.920
Take off your clothes.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.360
You first.

25:09.440 --> 25:11.840
Take off your clothes.

25:12.880 --> 25:14.680
OK.

25:22.640 --> 25:24.640
Go to hell.

25:31.880 --> 25:33.800
Stop it. Dad.

26:22.320 --> 26:25.560
- " Who is it?"
- It's Behrooz.

26:46.120 --> 26:47.920
Behrooz.

27:00.400 --> 27:02.600
Good job, Behrooz.

27:31.240 --> 27:33.840
- Debbie, what are you doing here?
- I followed you.

27:33.920 --> 27:35.960
- Why?
- Cos I didn't believe you.

27:36.040 --> 27:38.200
I thought you were seeing someone else.

27:38.280 --> 27:42.200
Look around. Does it look
like I'm seeing anybody else?

27:42.280 --> 27:47.880
You shouldn't be here. I'm working for my
father. He doesn't like me socialising at work.

27:47.960 --> 27:51.120
OK. I get it.

27:51.200 --> 27:54.880
That doesn't explain
why you stopped calling me.

27:55.920 --> 27:58.280
It's my parents.

27:58.360 --> 28:02.320
They've got a problem
with me seeing someone that's...

28:03.200 --> 28:05.600
Not Muslim?

28:06.440 --> 28:07.800
Yeah.

28:08.960 --> 28:12.160
- And that's it? Whatever they say, you do?
- No.

28:12.240 --> 28:15.320
Then what's going on between us?
Do you wanna be with me or not?

28:15.400 --> 28:17.800
- I do, but...
- But what?

28:19.320 --> 28:23.400
Debbie, I wanna straighten things out,
but I can't do it now.

28:23.480 --> 28:25.920
We'll get together later.

28:27.920 --> 28:29.560
Debbie, please.

29:01.200 --> 29:05.880
- Is everything ready for Richard Heller?
- Just about. They're starting to hook him up.

29:05.960 --> 29:08.400
Then let's do it.

29:08.480 --> 29:12.160
Does Driscoll know you're subjecting
Heller's son to a lie detector?

29:12.240 --> 29:13.920
- Yeah.
- Is he a suspect?

29:14.000 --> 29:19.800
Not exactly, but he's on very poor terms with
his father. I wouldn't wanna rule anything out.

29:19.880 --> 29:25.560
- You want to be in the room on this?
- No, I'll observe through the one-way.

29:30.000 --> 29:34.560
- What are you doing? What are you doing?
- We wanna make sure you're telling the truth.

29:34.640 --> 29:39.000
Why would I lie to you? My father
and my sister have just been kidnapped.

29:39.080 --> 29:42.320
Please sit back, Richard,
or I'll have to sedate you.

29:42.400 --> 29:46.960
You can't do this to me.
My father is the secretary of defense.

29:47.040 --> 29:49.480
I understand.
But according to my information,

29:49.560 --> 29:53.640
you were about to unleash personal attacks
on your father at a rally at Lockheed.

29:53.720 --> 29:57.960
Are you insane? This is America.
I can say what I want in public.

29:58.040 --> 30:01.520
- How dare you treat me like a criminal.
- I'm not.

30:01.600 --> 30:04.680
You wanna be constructive?
Find my father and my sister.

30:04.760 --> 30:08.920
- We intend to.
- By treating me like I'm guilty of something!

30:09.000 --> 30:13.920
Richard, right now, you are the only witness
to your father and your sister's kidnapping.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.840
- We need your help.
- Then get these things off of me

30:16.920 --> 30:20.160
and start talking to me
like a normal human being.

30:20.240 --> 30:24.720
- You don't have anything to hide, do you?
- No.

30:24.800 --> 30:27.000
How's the polygraph?

30:27.080 --> 30:29.280
100 per cent.

30:40.400 --> 30:42.040
Father.

30:48.040 --> 30:50.560
How did everything go?

30:50.640 --> 30:53.040
It went fine.

31:02.800 --> 31:07.200
Omar said one of his men saw you
with someone outside the compound.

31:07.280 --> 31:11.040
- A young woman.
- I was going to tell you.

31:11.880 --> 31:13.880
Who was it?

31:16.960 --> 31:20.200
- Debbie.
- Where is she now?

31:20.280 --> 31:25.520
- She didn't see anything.
- She saw you at the compound. It's enough.

31:27.440 --> 31:31.560
We've spent years planning for this,
waiting for this day to come.

31:31.640 --> 31:34.440
Now it's here
and you've compromised everything.

31:34.520 --> 31:38.720
She didn't see anything.
I made sure of it.

31:38.800 --> 31:41.640
We'll see how much she knows.

31:41.720 --> 31:44.360
Call her and tell her to come here.

31:44.440 --> 31:50.440
- Please don't do this. It's not necessary.
- I decide what's necessary, not you.

31:51.880 --> 31:56.520
- What are you going to do to her?
- Since when do you question me?

31:57.920 --> 32:02.280
How long have we lived in this country,
preparing for this day?

32:02.840 --> 32:04.440
How long?

32:04.520 --> 32:06.240
Four years.

32:06.320 --> 32:09.120
Almost five.

32:10.600 --> 32:15.800
That's how much time can be erased
by a simple mistake.

32:23.640 --> 32:25.840
Call her. Now!

32:27.080 --> 32:29.080
Yes, sir.

32:37.640 --> 32:40.040
- Tim Felson. MTA.
- Ronnie Lobell. CTU.

32:40.120 --> 32:42.280
Head of field ops. Where's track three?

32:42.360 --> 32:47.240
- East entrance. My guys can lock it down.
- We don't wanna draw attention to anything.

32:47.320 --> 32:50.200
The platform's just at the end of this hall.

33:03.880 --> 33:06.240
- Hello.
- " Andrew, it's me."

33:06.320 --> 33:09.160
- Where are they?
- On site. They'll be there any minute.

33:09.240 --> 33:11.320
All right. Tell 'em to hurry up.

33:11.400 --> 33:16.200
It doesn't work that way. Stay where you are
and I'll talk to you when they bring you in.

33:16.280 --> 33:19.480
- Andrew.
- Yeah. Are you Jack Bauer?

33:19.560 --> 33:22.240
- Yes. Come on. Let's go.
- Where are we going?

33:22.320 --> 33:26.400
I'll explain later. It's not safe here. Let's go.

33:32.960 --> 33:34.760
Just around the corner.

33:43.680 --> 33:47.560
- You sure he said the bottom of the ramp?
- Yeah.

34:01.160 --> 34:03.040
- Hello.
- Andrew.

34:03.680 --> 34:07.000
- Who's this?
- It's Jack Bauer. Where are you?

34:08.880 --> 34:10.360
Andrew?

34:10.440 --> 34:13.199
I can't really... talk.

34:15.679 --> 34:17.880
- Let's go.
- Andrew.

34:17.960 --> 34:21.239
Andrew. Son of a bitch.
They got to him before we did.

34:21.320 --> 34:24.320
- How did they know where he would be?
- I don't know.

34:25.800 --> 34:30.159
- Who are you?
- I'll kill you if you don't follow my orders.

34:30.239 --> 34:34.480
Felson, come on. Alert your MTAs. Tell 'em
we've got a Caucasian male, early 20s,

34:34.560 --> 34:37.760
wearing a brown jacket,
being taken from here against his will.

34:37.840 --> 34:42.199
Tell your men not to engage the target.
I want a visual and a location. That's it. Now.

34:59.320 --> 35:01.880
Where are you taking me?

35:07.840 --> 35:10.520
- This is Marx. I see the target.
- What's your 20?

35:10.600 --> 35:16.600
I'm on the train platform. Target is on the
easternmost periphery. Second-level parking.

35:16.680 --> 35:18.440
Open the door.

35:18.960 --> 35:21.760
- They're in a dark blue Lexus.
- What's the fastest way?

35:21.840 --> 35:24.560
- Out the back.
- Tell your men to stay out of sight.

35:24.640 --> 35:27.640
Stay on the guy,
but make sure he doesn't see you.

35:30.680 --> 35:33.400
Lay down.

36:16.480 --> 36:21.000
There he is. You get the gate.
I'll get the kid out of the car.

36:21.080 --> 36:23.720
- Wait.
- Wait for what?

36:23.800 --> 36:26.560
- This isn't the right play.
- What?

36:26.640 --> 36:31.000
- If we follow him, he may lead us to Heller.
- Or maybe he won't, but he'll kill the kid.

36:31.080 --> 36:35.840
Right now, this hostile's
our best chance to find Secretary Heller.

36:36.440 --> 36:40.440
- We'll break him back at CTU.
- You don't know if you can break him in time.

36:40.520 --> 36:43.840
This is not a field ops call, Jack.

36:43.920 --> 36:46.400
We need authorisation.

36:47.760 --> 36:51.560
I can't take the chance
of Driscoll resisting me.

37:02.120 --> 37:05.880
- I told you not to go against me, Jack.
- Ronnie, please.

37:05.960 --> 37:08.760
You get up.
Interlace your hands behind your head.

37:08.840 --> 37:11.960
- You're making a mistake.
- Shut up.

37:21.680 --> 37:27.040
Gate four, he's leaving the parking lot.
What do you want me to do?

37:28.440 --> 37:34.360
This is Lobell. I'm moving in now. Let the
front car go ahead and lock in the hostile.

37:58.760 --> 38:00.600
Ronnie.

38:00.680 --> 38:03.280
Ronnie, where you been hit?

38:04.080 --> 38:06.280
Can you move?

38:07.280 --> 38:08.680
Ronnie.

38:08.760 --> 38:11.880
Give me the keys to the cuffs.

38:17.320 --> 38:20.360
Please, Ronnie. He's our only lead.

38:20.440 --> 38:22.840
We gotta stop him.

38:30.720 --> 38:32.960
Come on.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.120
Dammit!

39:19.040 --> 39:22.000
So tell me what happened, Richard.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.240
My father and I were talking

39:25.320 --> 39:27.480
and...

39:27.560 --> 39:31.880
- my sister came in with a phone call for him.
- He was in the room on the call?

39:31.960 --> 39:36.160
- No. He and Audrey went outside.
- All right. Go on.

39:36.240 --> 39:40.040
Then I heard an explosion, looked out
the window and saw 'em being grabbed.

39:40.120 --> 39:42.920
And they didn't come in and get you?

39:43.000 --> 39:45.880
I know you told me not to interrupt,
but we need you.

39:45.960 --> 39:49.440
- What's going on?
- A webcast is on servers all over the place.

39:49.520 --> 39:52.760
- A webcast of what?
- Secretary of Defense Heller.

39:53.880 --> 39:56.960
The terrorists are broadcasting this
all over the Internet.

39:57.040 --> 39:59.280
Call Curtis.

39:59.360 --> 40:02.160
Curtis, we need you on the floor.

40:28.520 --> 40:31.000
There you are, you son of a bitch.

40:31.080 --> 40:35.880
We speak for the men, women and
children who have had no voice until now.

40:35.960 --> 40:41.840
Who have been victimised by the genocidal
policies of the US that Heller has advanced.

40:42.560 --> 40:45.440
But the time has come
for the victims to demand justice.

40:45.520 --> 40:47.520
Edgar, isolate Secretary Heller.

40:47.600 --> 40:52.520
Our soldiers have taken
the terrorist James Heller into custody.

40:52.600 --> 40:57.360
In three hours, Heller will be tried
for war crimes against humanity.

40:57.440 --> 41:03.080
If he is proven guilty, he will be executed
in accordance with our laws.

41:03.160 --> 41:09.160
Because we have nothing to hide, the world
will have full access to these proceedings.

41:41.320 --> 41:44.400
