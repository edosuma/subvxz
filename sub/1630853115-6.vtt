WEBVTT

00:22.313 --> 00:24.649
<i>may very well be the longest walk</i>

00:24.733 --> 00:26.484
<i>any young lady ever takes.</i>

00:27.861 --> 00:30.905
<i>It does not simply</i>
<i>cover the length of the church,</i>

00:30.989 --> 00:35.118
<i>but rather, countless floors for dancing,</i>

00:35.201 --> 00:39.748
<i>and meandering paths</i>
<i>for every afternoon promenade too.</i>

00:41.332 --> 00:44.919
<i>It is a wonder, then,</i>
<i>that feet do not tire</i>

00:45.003 --> 00:47.547
<i>or, heaven forbid, trip</i>

00:47.630 --> 00:51.718
<i>under the scrutiny</i>
<i>of all those attentive eyes</i>

00:51.801 --> 00:54.596
<i>keeping close watch, indeed.</i>

01:00.185 --> 01:01.269
Does it fly?

01:01.352 --> 01:03.396
Uh, some, Your Majesty.

01:03.480 --> 01:04.981
What kind of answer is "some"?

01:05.065 --> 01:07.233
Well, it does not soar,
but if you like,

01:07.317 --> 01:10.820
I can place it on a high perch
and allow it to glide down.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.572
Only if<i> you </i>follow its path.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.246
The fireworks are ready, Your Majesty.

01:20.330 --> 01:24.042
Timed perfectly to discharge directly
after the bride and groom utter, "I do."

01:24.125 --> 01:26.628
Whatever you have planned
is not good enough, Brimsley.

01:26.711 --> 01:29.589
Make them bigger, longer, brighter.

01:29.672 --> 01:32.550
Our guests must be captivated.

01:35.887 --> 01:40.016
I believe I asked for His Majesty's wing
to be closed off today.

01:40.100 --> 01:43.978
I do not wish for anyone
to lose their way and end up somewhere…

01:46.356 --> 01:47.273
curious.

01:47.357 --> 01:49.400
Of course, ma'am.
Though, you may rest assured

01:49.484 --> 01:52.112
His Majesty appeared
in rather good spirits this morning.

01:53.696 --> 01:55.740
And what of our other grand plan?

01:55.824 --> 01:57.283
-Is everything in place?
-Indeed.

01:57.367 --> 02:00.411
Every young lady that remains
under suspicion of being Lady Whistledown

02:00.495 --> 02:03.164
will have a footman assigned to her,
watching her every move.

02:03.248 --> 02:04.999
Simply watching will not be enough.

02:05.083 --> 02:06.751
We must entrap the scribbler.

02:06.835 --> 02:10.380
Perhaps you might put forth false rumors

02:10.463 --> 02:15.135
so that when Whistledown prints them,
we will be able to trace the origins.

02:15.218 --> 02:18.763
-An ingenious idea, ma'am.
-Yes, that is why I thought of it.

02:19.305 --> 02:21.641
The author thinks she has bested us all

02:21.724 --> 02:24.060
with her illicit spying and reporting.

02:24.144 --> 02:28.857
Well, no one has sharper eyes
on the ton than I do.

02:54.257 --> 02:56.509
You must calm yourself, Bon. Keep still.

02:56.593 --> 02:58.887
It is all so strange.

02:58.970 --> 03:00.763
I have faced a thousand tomorrows,

03:00.847 --> 03:03.224
but they have
all been leading to this one.

03:03.308 --> 03:06.561
Tomorrow is a day you have been
preparing for your entire life, dearest.

03:06.644 --> 03:07.812
You are ready.

03:07.896 --> 03:12.192
I believed that to be true. But now
that the viscount has hastened things…

03:12.275 --> 03:13.776
Oh, it has caused you doubts?

03:13.860 --> 03:16.946
Bringing the wedding forward
is a sign of true feeling, but,

03:18.323 --> 03:20.867
well, it has unnerved me too.

03:20.950 --> 03:23.411
Rest assured, the viscount adores you.

03:23.494 --> 03:25.163
He has devotedly courted you

03:25.246 --> 03:28.291
and made his intentions clear
from our first arrival.

03:29.667 --> 03:30.710
Ooh.

03:31.961 --> 03:33.838
It is meant
to be a sipping spirit.

03:33.922 --> 03:36.966
Have you not heard? The viscount believes
in hurrying things along these days.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.344
First the wedding, now his drink.
I hope, for Edwina's sake,

03:39.427 --> 03:41.221
the tendency stops before the honeymoon.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.723
Have you always been so vulgar,

03:43.806 --> 03:46.559
or has staring at naked models all day
turned your brain to charcoal?

03:46.643 --> 03:48.394
Must he choose just one?

03:49.395 --> 03:51.940
That has always been the privilege
of not being the firstborn.

03:52.023 --> 03:55.652
You both get to choose
your passions and adventures,

03:55.735 --> 03:58.029
while I, on the other hand,
must fulfill my--

03:58.112 --> 04:00.031
Tell me, dear brother, once you marry,

04:00.114 --> 04:04.160
will your duty finally be fulfilled
so you can stop reminding everyone of it?

04:04.244 --> 04:06.871
I believe the reminders
are also my duty, so no.

04:06.955 --> 04:11.334
I still wish that when he looks at me,
I could be certain that he truly loves me.

04:11.417 --> 04:12.418
Oh…

04:12.502 --> 04:15.463
I fear, in fact,
that he does not look at me often enough.

04:19.050 --> 04:22.220
Looks can be powerful, Bon,
but also fleeting.

04:22.303 --> 04:25.265
Displays of mere passion,
perhaps. Nothing more.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.643
So the viscount
feels little passion for me?

04:28.726 --> 04:31.062
Of course not.
What I mean to say is that

04:31.145 --> 04:33.731
true love is something else entirely.

04:33.815 --> 04:36.567
It is when the rest
of the world goes quiet.

04:36.651 --> 04:40.446
It is not eyes that meet
but souls that dance.

04:41.447 --> 04:42.907
Settle into each other.

04:43.783 --> 04:45.451
Make room for each other

04:46.244 --> 04:48.705
until there is nowhere else to hide.

04:48.788 --> 04:50.081
No need to worry.

04:50.164 --> 04:51.874
Much will remain the same,

04:51.958 --> 04:55.753
apart from the fact that I shall finally
have my viscountess, as is required.

04:55.837 --> 04:58.423
Indeed.
Not much shall change at all.

04:58.506 --> 05:01.342
Though, soon enough, we will have
a tiny Anthony to contend with,

05:01.426 --> 05:04.679
running around, declaring
all of his tiny duties too, no doubt.

05:04.762 --> 05:06.597
Yes, he too shall be a tyrant.

05:06.681 --> 05:08.099
Is it not also said,

05:08.725 --> 05:10.852
when spread on an unmarried person,

05:10.935 --> 05:12.937
haldi will help them find a worthy partner

05:13.021 --> 05:15.231
that makes
the rest of the world quiet too?

05:15.315 --> 05:16.858
-Edwina--
-Now, now.

05:16.941 --> 05:18.735
It is your turn to hold still.

05:25.366 --> 05:26.326
<i>A toast!</i>

05:27.160 --> 05:29.329
What is it we are drinking to
if not the future?

05:29.412 --> 05:30.997
To, well,

05:31.956 --> 05:33.124
the sister.

05:33.207 --> 05:35.335
-The sister?
-The gatekeeper.

05:35.835 --> 05:38.212
I do wonder whether
this blessing would be greater

05:38.296 --> 05:40.631
if the viscount were here
to participate as well.

05:40.715 --> 05:44.510
Oh, I am certain Lord Bridgerton
has his own wedding traditions to perform.

05:44.594 --> 05:46.137
-To besting her.
-Hear! Hear!

05:46.220 --> 05:49.599
You do love gloating
about your victories, do you not, Brother?

05:55.897 --> 05:56.898
Mmm.

06:09.410 --> 06:13.581
My word, Prudence.
Stand up straight. Chin up. Chest out.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.918
However am I meant
to stand like this all day?

06:17.001 --> 06:18.503
Just stop your fidgeting.

06:21.047 --> 06:23.549
Lord Featherington has
so graciously allowed you to borrow

06:23.633 --> 06:26.469
this beautiful necklace for the occasion.

06:26.552 --> 06:28.679
It is very heavy.

06:28.763 --> 06:31.849
That means it's very valuable.
Remember that.

06:32.850 --> 06:34.644
You are certain about this?

06:34.727 --> 06:37.355
The young lady quite naturally
draws attention to herself.

06:37.438 --> 06:40.233
She will get people speaking
of the very valuable jewelry

06:40.316 --> 06:41.984
that came directly from your mines.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.153
I will, of course,
confirm that you are rather quiet

06:44.237 --> 06:46.656
about how well your business is doing,
out of modesty.

06:46.739 --> 06:50.159
And when the husbands come to you,
you agree to the arrangements.

06:50.243 --> 06:53.287
Your confidence is admirable, I concede.

06:53.371 --> 06:55.206
Would you prefer I cower?

06:55.289 --> 06:56.457
Oh, I did not say that.

06:56.541 --> 06:59.627
I cannot help but enjoy
a lady who seizes control.

07:02.588 --> 07:03.673
Pardon me, madam.

07:03.756 --> 07:05.174
Yes, well.

07:05.675 --> 07:07.260
I shall meet you in the carriage.

07:07.343 --> 07:08.302
Prudence.

07:21.399 --> 07:25.445
Mademoiselle Penelope,
I have made the alterations you requested.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.363
Thank you, Madame Delacroix.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.032
It is a great risk
for me to meet you here.

07:30.116 --> 07:33.744
Your mama will certainly know
you do not have a dress in need of repair.

07:33.828 --> 07:35.496
This could not wait any longer.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.957
What do you know of that apprentice
who works for our printer?

07:38.040 --> 07:39.917
A Mr. Theo Sharpe, I believe.

07:40.001 --> 07:42.336
Well, if you know his name,
you know much more than I do.

07:42.420 --> 07:44.547
Have any of our delivery boys
mentioned him?

07:45.381 --> 07:50.595
Is there something more serious you wish
to tell me about our little… undertaking?

07:51.345 --> 07:54.932
Because if there's trouble on the horizon,
I cannot be associated.

07:55.016 --> 07:57.935
-My business is too important--
-As is mine.

07:58.019 --> 08:00.104
And no, there is nothing
to worry about, I assure you.

08:00.188 --> 08:01.522
Madame Delacroix?

08:01.606 --> 08:03.274
I was not expecting you.

08:03.357 --> 08:06.861
-If this is about our bill--
-Ah, no, madame.

08:06.944 --> 08:10.198
I was just saying
I seem to have lost my head.

08:10.281 --> 08:13.618
This delivery is
for the Bridgertons, you see.

08:13.701 --> 08:16.412
I came here by mistake. Good day.

08:19.832 --> 08:23.586
Can you imagine? A woman
reduced to running her own business.

08:23.669 --> 08:27.840
No wonder her mind is so scattered.
Make haste. We can't be late.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.729
Didi? What are those?

08:42.980 --> 08:44.941
I brought them with us from home.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.777
I knew this season would be a success.

08:47.860 --> 08:50.988
They are quite beautiful.
How have I never seen them before?

08:51.072 --> 08:52.406
They belonged to my mother.

08:52.490 --> 08:55.701
Amma wore them
on her wedding day and saved them.

08:55.785 --> 08:56.619
For you?

08:56.702 --> 08:58.329
I brought them for you.

08:58.913 --> 09:00.164
I insist.

09:00.248 --> 09:04.085
-Beautiful bangles for a beautiful bride.

09:05.920 --> 09:09.131
Oh, Didi. I know
this has been a difficult time,

09:09.215 --> 09:13.719
and you never much cared for the viscount,
but I hope today we may all find joy.

09:13.803 --> 09:15.638
I am happy if you are happy.

09:22.520 --> 09:25.106
-He has taken my ribbon!
-I have done you a service.

09:25.189 --> 09:28.985
Do not chase each other.
Or, well, perhaps do not catch each other.

09:29.068 --> 09:31.362
You must look presentable.

09:31.445 --> 09:34.156
Why does no one
truly seem ready for this wedding?

09:34.240 --> 09:35.908
-Mrs. Wilson!
-Oh, Mother.

09:35.992 --> 09:37.451
Please, not so loud.

09:37.535 --> 09:40.204
Whatever you have done
to your brother, undo it.

09:42.081 --> 09:44.375
I may never reach
your capacity for drink, Brother.

09:44.458 --> 09:45.418
It's a simple remedy.

09:45.501 --> 09:48.379
If you continue to drink,
there can be no after-effects.

09:48.462 --> 09:50.548
If only you would use
your powers for good.

09:50.631 --> 09:52.133
Has anyone seen Anthony?

09:53.134 --> 09:54.510
Benedict, see that he is well.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.430
I am sure the emotions of the day
have somewhat confused him.

09:58.055 --> 09:58.889
Mother.

10:00.641 --> 10:01.601
Anthony.

10:02.602 --> 10:03.603
You are ready?

10:03.686 --> 10:06.147
Of course I am. Born ready, in fact.

10:07.106 --> 10:07.982
Shall we?

10:44.226 --> 10:45.353
Lady Danbury.

10:47.229 --> 10:48.564
Lady Bridgerton.

10:49.440 --> 10:53.778
It seems the two of us have not spoken
since our dinner with the Sheffields. Ha.

10:53.861 --> 10:57.156
Yes, it seems so. Though why would we?

10:57.239 --> 10:59.742
It is not as if you have
even more private information

10:59.825 --> 11:02.620
you wish at last to share with me, do you?

11:03.454 --> 11:05.956
-You must know--
-Enjoy the wedding, Lady Danbury.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.713
It is a wonder I have found
the two of you in the midst

11:12.797 --> 11:14.507
of all this opulence, is it not?

11:14.590 --> 11:17.009
Quite. Her Majesty's fondness
for the diamond exceeds

11:17.093 --> 11:18.969
even what Lady Whistledown suggests.

11:19.053 --> 11:21.847
Daphne's wedding was not nearly
as extraordinary, and she married a duke.

11:21.931 --> 11:23.933
Perhaps the queen requires
our attention in new ways.

11:24.016 --> 11:26.352
The weight of the Crown is quite heavy.

11:26.435 --> 11:29.647
Perhaps she seeks to prove herself
still significant and equal to the task.

11:29.730 --> 11:32.358
-Is that not the plight of all mankind?
-I believe it is.

11:32.441 --> 11:34.276
Do not indulge him.
He has been insufferable

11:34.360 --> 11:35.528
since returning from Greece.

11:35.611 --> 11:37.488
Or was it your visit with Lady Crane?

11:37.571 --> 11:39.615
The cause does not matter
nearly as much as the truth.

11:39.699 --> 11:43.536
One must make a name for oneself
if this life is to mean anything at all.

11:43.619 --> 11:44.578
A noble pursuit.

11:44.662 --> 11:45.788
Thank you, Pen.

11:45.871 --> 11:47.957
It is surprising that you and Eloise

11:48.040 --> 11:50.626
remain so familiar
when you could not be less alike.

11:50.710 --> 11:51.836
What can you mean?

11:51.919 --> 11:54.004
Well, you have sense.

11:56.424 --> 11:59.510
It is a fool's errand to try to make
an impression on those in good society

11:59.593 --> 12:01.554
who have not a single original thought.

12:01.637 --> 12:03.639
And what good is it anyway
to make a name for oneself

12:03.723 --> 12:05.433
if it is only to be written
on dance cards?

12:05.516 --> 12:08.018
What of Lady Whistledown?
She speaks of everyone without remorse.

12:08.102 --> 12:09.812
No. No, she does not speak of all.

12:10.479 --> 12:11.772
Perhaps she simply does not know

12:11.856 --> 12:14.567
that there are some
beyond the ton worthy of attention too.

12:14.650 --> 12:16.569
Are you speaking of Mr. Sharpe again, El?

12:16.652 --> 12:18.446
I have heeded your warnings.

12:19.071 --> 12:20.072
Theoretically.

12:21.532 --> 12:23.409
It'd be foolish of me
to continue to visit him.

12:23.492 --> 12:25.119
And what in actuality?

12:27.371 --> 12:28.539
I visited him the other day.

12:28.622 --> 12:30.958
But it's not nearly as scandalous
as you make it out to be.

12:31.041 --> 12:33.961
-It's only his thoughts I'm interested in.
-It is a friendship, then?

12:34.044 --> 12:36.756
Of course.
What else could it be?

12:51.437 --> 12:52.980
-Sister.
-You are late.

12:53.063 --> 12:55.775
Well, in truth, I was delayed by doubts

12:55.858 --> 12:59.236
about whether the festivities of this day
might or might not take place.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.614
Does the duchess
not care for your bride, Brother?

13:01.697 --> 13:04.909
I find Miss Edwina to be
quite lovely and deserving of the truth,

13:04.992 --> 13:06.410
which we must not deny her.

13:08.829 --> 13:11.624
I'm confused. Who is denying what to whom?

13:11.707 --> 13:14.794
Benedict, you must excuse us.
It seems the duchess has opinions.

13:14.877 --> 13:17.463
-But I wish to know--
-The best man listens to the groom. Go.

13:35.397 --> 13:37.691
I've gone too far down this road
to turn back now, Daph.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.903
Miss Edwina will be ruined
if we do not marry,

13:40.986 --> 13:43.113
and our family will suffer equal scandal.

13:45.407 --> 13:46.992
This was always the plan.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.119
And what of the sister?

13:50.663 --> 13:55.167
She has made her own plans for the future.
Plans which do not include me.

13:55.835 --> 13:58.337
We have decided
there is nothing more between us.

13:58.420 --> 13:59.421
There cannot be.

14:11.684 --> 14:14.770
Do you ever wonder what Father
might say on a day such as this?

14:17.314 --> 14:19.733
He was the only one
you ever truly respected.

14:21.068 --> 14:23.404
The only one
you ever listened to.

14:26.949 --> 14:29.326
-If Papa was still here--
-You cannot know what he would say.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.453
Father had different words
for me than he did for you.

14:31.537 --> 14:34.373
So please do not <i>insult </i>me
with your baseless conjecture.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.543
I have <i>been</i> here.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.754
And I have <i>seen</i> you at all stages.

14:41.255 --> 14:43.591
I witnessed you change the day he died.

14:43.674 --> 14:46.010
Do you know you did not even weep once?

14:46.510 --> 14:49.096
And you stopped laughing,
altogether, in fact.

14:49.763 --> 14:52.766
It was as though you had become
an <i>entirely</i> different person,

14:52.850 --> 14:55.644
<i>consumed</i> by the expectations of others.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.104
And what choice did I have?

14:58.105 --> 15:01.275
I changed so that
our family might survive,

15:01.358 --> 15:03.611
so that you could be
respectable enough to marry a duke.

15:03.694 --> 15:06.697
I am happy for you, Sister,
but I'm not like you.

15:06.780 --> 15:10.367
I have never wished to succumb
to the blind delight of being in love.

15:10.451 --> 15:11.911
I cannot so indulge myself.

15:11.994 --> 15:14.079
You can choose to be happy.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.042
To follow the desires of your heart

15:18.125 --> 15:22.588
instead of pushing away
<i>any</i> feeling that comes to the surface.

15:23.172 --> 15:26.050
It should not be a luxury,
but a right to choose,

15:26.133 --> 15:28.385
to fight for the family that you want.

15:28.469 --> 15:29.428
I fight…

15:30.471 --> 15:32.097
…for the family that I have.

15:32.890 --> 15:33.891
You'll never understand.

15:33.974 --> 15:35.601
You were born
to marry into another family.

15:35.684 --> 15:37.394
I was born to carry on
the Bridgerton name.

15:37.478 --> 15:39.188
That is what outweighs anything else.

15:40.105 --> 15:41.899
It is rather easy to be selfish

15:41.982 --> 15:45.235
when you have no one else
to whom you must answer.

15:50.157 --> 15:51.659
I mourn for you, Brother.

15:53.410 --> 15:55.579
All of these decisions
that you seem to make

15:55.663 --> 15:57.039
and then resent us for.

15:57.873 --> 16:00.501
Though they do not make you worthy
of your family's respect.

16:00.584 --> 16:02.336
They simply make us pity you.

16:03.545 --> 16:04.463
Nothing more.

16:21.063 --> 16:22.564
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

16:28.028 --> 16:29.154
My word.

16:31.281 --> 16:33.409
You look so beautiful, my darling.

16:50.092 --> 16:51.051
Didi?

16:51.135 --> 16:52.261
Yes, Bon?

16:53.387 --> 16:54.930
I cannot wear them.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.516
They do not belong to me,
and I do not want to feel

16:57.599 --> 17:00.060
as though I am taking
what is rightfully yours.

17:00.144 --> 17:01.729
They were meant for you.

17:02.438 --> 17:04.231
You should be the one to wear them.

17:11.780 --> 17:13.157
They suit you, Kate.

17:17.369 --> 17:18.787
It is time, my lady.

17:20.372 --> 17:21.999
Come.

17:22.082 --> 17:26.003
Let us put all of the nasty gossip
behind us for once and for all.

17:26.086 --> 17:29.089
Let us give the ton a wedding to remember,

17:29.173 --> 17:31.550
and show them who we truly are.

19:59.615 --> 20:01.408
Miss Edwina, you look lovely.

20:01.491 --> 20:04.286
Thank you, my lord.
I am happy you are pleased.

20:04.786 --> 20:06.622
Please be seated.

20:09.416 --> 20:10.709
Dearly beloved,

20:11.376 --> 20:14.546
we are gathered together here
in the sight of God,

20:14.630 --> 20:17.049
and in the face of this congregation,

20:17.132 --> 20:20.510
to join together this man and this woman

20:21.803 --> 20:23.222
in holy matrimony.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.975
And therefore,
it is not by any to be enterprised,

20:27.059 --> 20:31.647
nor taken in hand,
unadvisedly, lightly, and wantonly,

20:31.730 --> 20:35.901
to satisfy men's
carnal lusts and appetites,

20:35.984 --> 20:39.112
like brute beasts
that have no understanding…

20:40.030 --> 20:45.118
…but reverently, discreetly, advisedly…

21:08.684 --> 21:10.143
My lord.

21:12.020 --> 21:12.938
My lord.

21:32.624 --> 21:35.585
The archbishop
would like you to repeat, my lord,

21:36.420 --> 21:37.296
after him.

21:37.379 --> 21:38.338
Yes, of course.

21:41.758 --> 21:44.011
I, Lord Anthony Bridgerton…

21:52.144 --> 21:53.020
Allow me.

22:12.622 --> 22:13.790
Might I continue?

22:13.874 --> 22:16.001
-My apologies.
-My apologies.

22:17.794 --> 22:20.756
Viscount, repeat after me.

22:20.839 --> 22:22.632
I…

22:26.887 --> 22:28.055
Miss Edwina, are you--

22:28.138 --> 22:29.765
I need a moment!

22:51.703 --> 22:55.415
-What has happened to my wedding?
-The bride seems to have run away, ma'am.

23:08.845 --> 23:11.890
Breathe, Edwina. It is just nerves.

23:11.973 --> 23:14.476
We will call for tea, and once
you have something in your stomach,

23:14.559 --> 23:16.436
you will be strong enough
to go back out there.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.814
The viscount--
The viscount will understand, yes, Kate?

23:19.815 --> 23:23.235
-Kate, perhaps you might find that tea--
-It is not tea that I want!

23:24.861 --> 23:27.072
What I want is the truth.

23:27.155 --> 23:28.615
Oh.

23:29.116 --> 23:31.952
-Suddenly, your words fail you, Sister?
-Edwina. Kate.

23:32.035 --> 23:34.913
-I am not sure what is going on.
-I shall tell you what is going on, Mama.

23:34.996 --> 23:36.915
After a lifetime
of filling my head with nonsense,

23:36.998 --> 23:39.918
of all this talk of great,
gallant notions and looks between lovers--

23:40.001 --> 23:42.462
-Edwina--
-You have <i>feelings </i>for him!

23:43.088 --> 23:45.549
All this time,
you wanted him for yourself.

23:45.632 --> 23:48.635
-No, that is not true.
-Oh, you cannot deny it now, Kate.

23:49.594 --> 23:54.433
How could I have been such a fool?
You lied to me again and again.

23:54.516 --> 23:56.101
You told--

23:56.184 --> 23:57.227
You told me.

23:57.894 --> 24:00.564
You told me we had put
all secrets to rest, but no.

24:01.189 --> 24:05.026
The Sheffield inheritance, that was merely
the <i>beginning</i> of your deception.

24:05.861 --> 24:10.740
I fooled myself into believing
you had only the purest of intentions,

24:11.491 --> 24:14.327
that your only desire
was for me to be happy.

24:14.411 --> 24:17.706
And you are no one's fool.
That is the truth.

24:19.207 --> 24:20.041
Do you love him?

24:20.125 --> 24:21.376
What?

24:21.460 --> 24:24.129
You told me you hated him.

24:24.713 --> 24:27.048
But that only meant your feelings…

24:27.924 --> 24:29.426
your feelings were strong.

24:31.636 --> 24:33.221
Do you love him?

24:38.477 --> 24:39.769
Edwina, I--

24:42.647 --> 24:43.899
That is enough.

24:44.524 --> 24:46.443
No good can come from this at present.

24:47.444 --> 24:50.405
Let us all take a moment
to calm ourselves, shall we?

24:51.781 --> 24:54.743
You have kept so very much from me.

24:55.494 --> 24:58.079
Go. Anywhere else, Kate.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.419
Does this have anything
to do with our dinner

25:46.503 --> 25:48.129
with the Sheffields the other evening?

25:48.213 --> 25:50.423
Or perhaps some
even greater issue has come to pass

25:50.507 --> 25:51.883
that we must discuss, Anthony?

25:51.967 --> 25:54.636
Miss Edwina is merely agitated.
She will come to her senses.

25:54.719 --> 25:57.430
Miss Edwina does seem
to have a delicate constitution.

25:57.514 --> 26:00.100
-Perhaps fresh air will be just the thing.
-Flask.

26:00.183 --> 26:03.061
Perhaps the archbishop's talk
of lifelong covenants overwhelmed her.

26:03.144 --> 26:05.772
Perhaps she realized that marriage is,
in fact, a prison for women.

26:05.855 --> 26:08.441
Ugh. Must you always be so… you?

26:08.525 --> 26:11.278
How else should I be? Married and silent?

26:11.361 --> 26:13.738
Perhaps she decided
she must change into a different dress.

26:13.822 --> 26:15.198
Absurd. She looked beautiful.

26:15.282 --> 26:18.201
Perhaps we should
allow Anthony a little respite.

26:19.160 --> 26:20.662
Brother, is that what you need?

26:28.044 --> 26:29.045
Precisely.

26:34.217 --> 26:35.051
What?

26:35.135 --> 26:36.886
-You know something.
-I do not.

26:36.970 --> 26:39.514
Daphne, you may be a duchess,
but you are still my daughter.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.224
Tell me what you know.

26:49.482 --> 26:52.402
A failed wedding
with their queen presiding.

26:53.111 --> 26:55.071
As if I needed the embarrassment.

26:55.155 --> 26:57.365
It is not your fault, Your Majesty.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.451
Lady Whistledown will make it so.

27:00.118 --> 27:03.538
"Her Majesty has picked poorly,"
she will say.

27:03.622 --> 27:06.916
My once immaculate taste now questioned.

27:07.000 --> 27:11.212
Her words carry far too much import
for my delicate comfort.

27:12.047 --> 27:14.549
Your Majesty, with all due respect,

27:14.633 --> 27:18.678
we may very well find ourselves
in a situation that cannot be salvaged.

27:18.762 --> 27:21.848
-It would be wise--
-Well, it must be salvaged.

27:21.931 --> 27:24.893
You vouched for this family,
did you not, Lady Danbury?

27:26.102 --> 27:27.729
I never would have entertained the thought

27:27.812 --> 27:31.733
of making Miss Edwina my diamond,
let alone arranging this elaborate affair,

27:31.816 --> 27:33.568
if it was not for you.

27:34.235 --> 27:37.238
This is as much
your blunder as anyone else's.

27:37.322 --> 27:39.491
You must not forget that.

27:39.574 --> 27:41.576
Indeed, I will not.

27:45.330 --> 27:48.583
Perhaps I may go and find Miss Edwina.

27:49.417 --> 27:51.920
Perhaps there is something I can do.

27:53.713 --> 27:54.547
Brimsley.

27:55.548 --> 27:58.718
Escort the guests to the gardens
and do not allow anyone to leave.

27:58.802 --> 28:03.431
The nuptials shall resume shortly,
and we shall proceed with our plans.

28:04.015 --> 28:05.058
All of them.

28:26.621 --> 28:29.624
I heard Miss Edwina has not eaten
a morsel since the engagement

28:29.708 --> 28:31.209
in order to fit into her dress.

28:31.292 --> 28:32.961
It's no wonder she's been taken ill.

28:33.044 --> 28:36.339
I hear the royal physician has brought in
leeches to hasten her recovery.

28:36.423 --> 28:37.924
Can you imagine?

28:38.007 --> 28:39.843
Rather embarrassing for Lord Bridgerton.

28:39.926 --> 28:41.761
And yet far more worrying for us.

28:41.845 --> 28:43.596
What guarantee do the rest of us have

28:43.680 --> 28:46.349
that these other young ladies
will not follow the lead of the chit?

28:46.433 --> 28:48.268
Jilting their grooms left and right.

28:50.812 --> 28:53.356
A rather fortuitous
turn of events, my lord.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.567
Nothing makes the ton
come alive like a fresh scandal.

28:55.650 --> 28:58.570
All eyes and ears seem
to be open for the freshest detail.

28:58.653 --> 29:02.949
I suppose all we must do now
is redirect their attention.

29:04.200 --> 29:05.285
Prudence.

29:07.412 --> 29:09.080
Do you wish to insult Lord Featherington

29:09.164 --> 29:12.041
by not showing off
this beautiful necklace?

29:12.125 --> 29:15.253
I do not understand why
he should care whether I cherish it so.

29:15.336 --> 29:17.922
We are already engaged,
and he barely speaks to me.

29:18.006 --> 29:19.716
What sort of engagement
is born of silence?

29:19.799 --> 29:22.969
Do as I say, child. Or would you rather
be without any prospects, like Penelope?

29:23.052 --> 29:25.305
-Heaven forbid.
-Oh… Come on.

29:28.558 --> 29:30.727
I've given much consideration
to what you said.

29:30.810 --> 29:32.771
About Mr. Sharpe
and his degree of interest.

29:32.854 --> 29:34.856
No. El, I did not intend you
to think about that.

29:34.939 --> 29:36.900
You should put him out of your mind.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.069
I know it is…

29:40.153 --> 29:43.865
…odd, but I had assumed ours
was merely an intellectual bond,

29:43.948 --> 29:47.660
a friendship based in like-minded thought
and rigorous conversation.

29:47.744 --> 29:50.330
But what if you are right?
What if he feels more?

29:50.413 --> 29:53.750
I never said--
El, do you want him to feel more?

29:55.794 --> 29:57.587
My feelings about his feelings
do not matter

29:57.670 --> 29:59.839
if I do not know for a fact
what it is he is feeling.

30:01.674 --> 30:03.635
Perhaps you have
already gone farther than is wise.

30:04.427 --> 30:06.679
Have you not heard
of all the trouble that befell Lady Mary

30:06.763 --> 30:08.306
because she married beneath her station?

30:08.389 --> 30:10.683
No one speaks of marriage, Pen.

30:10.767 --> 30:14.479
I am speaking of… clarity of thought.

30:14.562 --> 30:16.523
-I simply would like to know.
-But why?

30:17.357 --> 30:19.108
I can accept certain mysteries.

30:19.192 --> 30:21.236
I may never know how men
came to be considered leaders

30:21.319 --> 30:23.279
when women are clearly better suited.

30:23.363 --> 30:25.907
I may never understand
why the modiste tortures her own clients

30:25.990 --> 30:27.534
with tight bodices and scratchy fabrics.

30:27.617 --> 30:29.911
I may never even know
who is behind Lady Whistledown.

30:29.994 --> 30:31.412
And you could accept such a mystery?

30:31.496 --> 30:35.250
Of course not, but…
those are mysteries I may never solve.

30:35.333 --> 30:38.670
This one with Theo-- Mr. Sharpe, I can.

30:38.753 --> 30:41.631
But what good will it do?
It is not as though you can act on it.

30:42.507 --> 30:43.550
I suppose

30:44.133 --> 30:46.845
if I know for sure, it will be a relief.

30:46.928 --> 30:51.099
It is the not knowing
that makes it feel like… torment.

30:51.182 --> 30:54.102
To turn over in your mind
the events of a mere conversation.

30:54.185 --> 30:56.771
To look at all of the evidence
and still not be sure.

30:56.855 --> 30:59.274
It is a pleasing, stimulating,

30:59.941 --> 31:02.068
thrilling kind of torment.

31:03.027 --> 31:04.737
-Have you ever felt that way?
-No.

31:04.821 --> 31:06.698
I can only imagine such a thing.

31:07.198 --> 31:08.116
Mmm.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.459
Lord Bridgerton.

31:18.543 --> 31:19.460
Lady Mary.

31:20.587 --> 31:22.130
I was hoping to speak with Miss Edwina.

31:27.051 --> 31:28.052
Of course.

31:33.182 --> 31:34.475
Lord Bridgerton.

31:39.063 --> 31:41.232
I am quite certain this delay is rather

31:42.066 --> 31:43.026
unexpected.

31:43.109 --> 31:44.152
Indeed.

31:44.235 --> 31:48.448
But I must ask if it is, in fact,
a delay and nothing more?

31:53.369 --> 31:56.456
I am considering what more
there may be regarding our courtship

31:56.539 --> 31:59.292
and those involved with its… interference.

31:59.375 --> 32:01.044
-I know you may think that we--
-Please.

32:01.628 --> 32:05.590
Tell me you did not come here to offer me
more lies or half-truths, my lord.

32:06.341 --> 32:07.800
At least offer me that.

32:11.179 --> 32:12.972
I am intent upon this marriage.

32:13.556 --> 32:16.100
The very fact that we have
arrived at this day with whatever

32:16.184 --> 32:18.811
interference there might have been
should be proof enough.

32:20.980 --> 32:22.023
Indeed.

32:22.815 --> 32:25.735
Yet I still wonder
whether it is the marriage

32:25.818 --> 32:28.363
or me that you truly want.

32:32.617 --> 32:33.660
It is both.

32:35.578 --> 32:38.247
Miss Edwina, I have never
wavered in my intentions

32:38.331 --> 32:39.832
since the first moment of our meeting.

32:39.916 --> 32:41.751
It was clear to me then, as it is now,

32:41.834 --> 32:44.045
that what we share
is greater than all else.

32:44.128 --> 32:46.130
And what is it that you believe we share?

32:46.214 --> 32:47.090
Our places.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.552
Our roles. They align.

32:51.636 --> 32:53.805
I, as the viscount. You, as the diamond.

32:53.888 --> 32:55.682
Neither by our own choice.

32:57.475 --> 33:01.104
We are yoked to each other
in that respect.

33:01.187 --> 33:03.106
It is why I never gave up pursuing you,

33:03.189 --> 33:05.608
even when some
thought me a fool to continue.

33:06.192 --> 33:10.446
It is why I was not swayed by the insults
of the Sheffields or your lack of a dowry.

33:12.365 --> 33:14.575
Because… you love me?

33:22.834 --> 33:24.210
I understand you.

33:25.837 --> 33:27.422
I sympathize with you.

33:28.506 --> 33:30.049
In a certain light, I am you.

33:30.133 --> 33:33.678
We do not have the luxury of choice.
We cannot escape our roles.

33:33.761 --> 33:34.637
But married,

33:36.556 --> 33:39.559
we may face these difficulties together.

33:43.438 --> 33:44.814
And what of my sister?

33:45.481 --> 33:48.109
What role will she play
between us in the future?

33:52.196 --> 33:56.409
The thorn easily removed
from the blossoming flower of our lives.

33:57.827 --> 33:59.829
She shall have no place in our future.

34:00.538 --> 34:03.458
Once we marry,
she will return to India, as she wishes.

34:05.543 --> 34:07.253
And you and I will be free of her.

34:07.336 --> 34:09.380
And that is what you now wish?

34:11.632 --> 34:12.967
That is what I now know.

34:14.594 --> 34:17.472
The great distance between us
will only bring you and I closer.

34:17.555 --> 34:21.142
But that future is only possible
if you decide today…

34:23.144 --> 34:24.103
to marry me.

34:30.610 --> 34:32.820
I have been told
what my future will look like

34:32.904 --> 34:35.448
more times than I now
wish to admit, my lord.

34:36.157 --> 34:37.658
But I am no fool.

34:38.910 --> 34:40.620
I know the scandal that would ensue

34:40.703 --> 34:42.955
should the two of us
fail to see this through now.

34:44.874 --> 34:47.293
But I cannot find that reason enough.

34:50.379 --> 34:52.465
I require a moment to think.

34:52.548 --> 34:54.300
Of my future, indeed.

34:54.383 --> 34:56.594
But only in the way
that I might now imagine it.

34:56.677 --> 34:57.845
You must understand.

34:59.639 --> 35:00.598
Of course.

35:03.351 --> 35:04.519
Of course I do.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.477
You cannot be here.

36:28.561 --> 36:30.855
-Miss Sharma--
-This is my place of refuge.

36:32.231 --> 36:33.566
-A closet?
-Yes.

36:33.649 --> 36:36.402
It may not be grand,
but it met my main requirement

36:36.485 --> 36:40.114
when you were not present.
So go and leave me in peace.

36:41.407 --> 36:42.366
We must speak.

36:42.909 --> 36:45.620
-Do you realize how improper this is--
-I've just met with Miss Edwina.

36:48.664 --> 36:51.167
She was harsher
than I knew her capable of being.

36:51.834 --> 36:53.669
Well, you cannot fault her for that.

36:54.295 --> 36:56.505
I concede I do not know her
as well as you do,

36:56.589 --> 36:58.841
but that is why I am coming to you.
You must do something.

36:58.925 --> 37:00.676
What would you have me do, my lord?

37:00.760 --> 37:04.472
More plotting and scheming
to… get her to comply?

37:04.972 --> 37:09.435
It seems my sister
has finally become wise to all of it.

37:10.978 --> 37:13.147
In one way, I should be quite proud.

37:13.231 --> 37:16.234
So you intend simply to cease to help her,

37:16.317 --> 37:18.486
and hide in a closet
as she ruins her life?

37:20.696 --> 37:22.490
I have ruined her life.

37:27.828 --> 37:28.913
You should not be here.

37:30.039 --> 37:31.457
Just, just…

37:40.967 --> 37:41.926
Wait.

37:58.276 --> 37:59.777
Goodbye, my lord.

38:09.620 --> 38:10.663
Lady Danbury.

38:13.207 --> 38:15.334
Whatever are you doing in here?

38:15.960 --> 38:18.796
I assure you, it is for good reason

38:18.879 --> 38:22.383
that I am in here and not out there.

38:22.466 --> 38:25.928
It is unlike you to be
off somewhere, hiding.

38:27.221 --> 38:28.055
Well,

38:28.597 --> 38:32.977
we all require a modicum
of self-reflection from time to time.

38:33.519 --> 38:35.104
-Do you not think?
-Mmm.

38:39.775 --> 38:41.193
Lady Bridgerton.

38:43.279 --> 38:46.949
I must apologize for not sharing

38:47.700 --> 38:50.578
certain information with you.

38:50.661 --> 38:53.622
That business between
the Sharmas and the Sheffields, well,

38:53.706 --> 38:57.043
it was not my place, but I certainly

38:57.126 --> 38:58.836
did not wish it to be revealed

38:58.919 --> 39:02.423
as it was at that dinner.

39:03.382 --> 39:06.510
This entire scheme
seems to have got out of hand.

39:06.594 --> 39:07.845
Indeed it has.

39:09.055 --> 39:10.556
Daphne has, uh…

39:10.639 --> 39:13.601
Well, she has finally confirmed something

39:13.684 --> 39:16.228
I have been fearing for quite some time.

39:17.313 --> 39:18.147
Ah.

39:18.230 --> 39:21.359
Something I believe
you too have observed, no doubt.

39:26.447 --> 39:28.074
Her Majesty

39:28.157 --> 39:31.202
wishes me to repair

39:31.285 --> 39:33.204
today's situation.

39:33.913 --> 39:37.833
And for what may very well be
the first time in my life…

39:40.503 --> 39:42.088
I do not know what to do.

40:02.650 --> 40:04.777
Look! Peacocks!

40:04.860 --> 40:06.862
Dreadful creatures!

40:06.946 --> 40:08.531
They attack, unprovoked.

40:08.614 --> 40:11.659
As if the day
could get any more unfortunate.

40:12.660 --> 40:15.454
You could always tell her
that there is nothing to be done.

40:15.538 --> 40:17.832
The Queen of England?

40:17.915 --> 40:21.919
I would rather go out there
and offer my hand to one of those birds.

40:22.002 --> 40:24.547
-It would be less painful.

40:38.978 --> 40:41.814
Do you think the bride
will return to that altar?

40:42.731 --> 40:46.944
There is only one person
who can answer that question.

40:49.196 --> 40:50.489
-Hmm.

40:54.869 --> 40:56.036
What?

40:57.288 --> 40:59.039
-Has Mama--
-You seem to know all.

40:59.582 --> 41:01.917
How could I possibly offer
any insight of my own?

41:04.378 --> 41:07.047
She is off, getting some air.

41:22.563 --> 41:24.940
Edwina, you must know

41:25.024 --> 41:27.276
I never intended to wound you.

41:27.902 --> 41:29.570
I know I should have told you more.

41:29.653 --> 41:31.655
I should have told you everything.

41:33.115 --> 41:37.328
Yes. Yes, I once did
have feelings for the viscount.

41:38.037 --> 41:39.705
But they were no match for the love

41:39.788 --> 41:42.041
I had, and continue to have, for you.

41:42.124 --> 41:45.336
And you must know
I will do everything in my power

41:45.419 --> 41:47.379
to ensure your happiness.

41:47.463 --> 41:49.131
Including going back to India?

41:49.215 --> 41:50.758
That is your solution, is it not?

41:50.841 --> 41:52.259
I wish to make things right.

41:52.343 --> 41:55.095
My feelings for Lord Bridgerton
do not matter anymore.

41:55.179 --> 41:58.182
We do not have a future together. But you…

41:58.682 --> 42:02.478
You, Edwina, were born to be viscountess.

42:07.775 --> 42:09.652
The viscount said the same.

42:09.735 --> 42:13.322
I half expect to discover
the two of you prepared it ahead of time.

42:15.324 --> 42:18.118
I am not too proud
to admit when he is right.

42:19.662 --> 42:21.622
-You deserve this.
-Why?

42:21.705 --> 42:23.999
Why me and why not you?

42:29.505 --> 42:32.383
You view your youth
and naïveté as a hindrance,

42:32.466 --> 42:34.552
but it has shielded you in many ways.

42:35.135 --> 42:39.932
You do not remember when Appa died,
when the world fell out from beneath us.

42:40.015 --> 42:42.601
And so, to save us
from an even worse fate,

42:42.685 --> 42:47.773
I promised I would not consider myself
until you and Mama were taken care of.

42:47.856 --> 42:51.235
I gave what I had without regret,
and I would do it again, Bon.

42:51.318 --> 42:54.697
I still do it. I give what I have
in order to protect you.

42:59.368 --> 43:01.787
Say something, Bon. Anything, please.

43:04.623 --> 43:07.209
I do not know which pains me more.

43:08.460 --> 43:12.172
-Your betrayal or your pity.
-Edwina, you are my sister--

43:12.256 --> 43:14.383
<i>Half</i> -sister.

43:16.677 --> 43:19.430
What I am, Kate, is a grown woman.

43:21.515 --> 43:23.100
And for the first time in my life,

43:23.183 --> 43:26.145
I am able to make a decision
based on what I would like.

43:27.313 --> 43:30.316
I have already imagined the life
I would lead with Lord Bridgerton

43:30.399 --> 43:33.110
as viscountess at Aubrey Hall.

43:33.193 --> 43:36.864
It lives in my own mind,
and it is mine to do with as I like.

43:37.364 --> 43:39.950
So if I choose to marry Anthony,

43:40.034 --> 43:43.370
it will be because
it pleases me and no one else.

43:43.454 --> 43:46.248
I need you to understand that.

43:47.708 --> 43:50.210
If I go through with this wedding,

43:51.670 --> 43:54.757
it will have nothing to do with you.

44:08.228 --> 44:10.314
Apparently,
it has to do with the honeymoon.

44:10.397 --> 44:12.483
Miss Edwina was not pleased
with the rather simple one

44:12.566 --> 44:14.068
Lord Bridgerton had planned.

44:14.151 --> 44:16.654
She is using the delay
to negotiate a new itinerary

44:16.737 --> 44:19.073
that will have
the queen's particular approval.

44:27.039 --> 44:30.668
It appears Miss Edwina is far more cunning
than we have given credit.

44:31.669 --> 44:33.462
-Gentlemen.
-Come now, Featherington.

44:33.545 --> 44:36.215
There's a more appropriate venue
for the discussion of business.

44:36.298 --> 44:37.925
We thought you might
be coy, Featherington.

44:38.008 --> 44:41.220
Now, are these mines
as profitable as we are hearing?

44:41.303 --> 44:43.597
I did not make the journey
across the Atlantic for pennies.

44:43.681 --> 44:47.142
If there's interest, I can send
word to my men on the ground in Georgia.

44:47.226 --> 44:48.143
-Very good.
-Indeed.

44:48.227 --> 44:50.938
And do these men
work for <i>you, </i>Featherington?

44:51.021 --> 44:52.314
Why, of course.

44:52.398 --> 44:55.693
Then why send word to your workers
if the investment is, in fact, yours?

44:55.776 --> 44:59.947
Because I must write to my men
to obtain the latest report.

45:00.531 --> 45:04.118
Wise investors would like to know
if it is rubies or amethysts

45:04.201 --> 45:06.161
that we are finding more of these days.

45:06.954 --> 45:10.082
Mr. Mondrich, I must ask
about this social club of yours.

45:11.041 --> 45:14.086
An admirable endeavor,
if not rather surprising.

45:14.169 --> 45:16.505
What can a boxer know
about running a business?

45:18.674 --> 45:21.969
About as much as
a gentleman knows about mining.

45:25.472 --> 45:26.432
Excuse me.

45:35.315 --> 45:36.316
Come in.

45:39.737 --> 45:42.364
-Have you yet come to any agreements?
-Almost.

45:42.448 --> 45:44.658
You must know time is
of the essence, my lord.

45:44.742 --> 45:47.244
Who knows how long
this wedding will be delayed?

45:47.327 --> 45:49.580
We may never again
have such an engaged audience.

45:49.663 --> 45:50.706
You must leave it with me.

45:50.789 --> 45:54.042
We must be careful
not to attract too much attention.

45:54.126 --> 45:57.212
This opportunity must appear
for the chosen few. Not to mention,

45:57.296 --> 46:00.924
we cannot risk snaring those who would
bring scandal outweighing any profit.

46:01.008 --> 46:04.303
I think it best we concentrate
our attentions on members of the ton

46:04.386 --> 46:07.806
who are not particularly beloved
and whose regard matters little.

46:07.890 --> 46:09.600
And who would make that list?

46:09.683 --> 46:13.312
The Cowpers, the Clarksons,
the Gorings, the Wallaces--

46:13.395 --> 46:16.857
Perhaps the better question is,
and who would not make that list?

46:20.444 --> 46:21.820
The Bridgertons, I suppose.

46:21.904 --> 46:24.364
They are on the verge
of enough scandal today all on their own.

46:24.448 --> 46:25.991
Well, they do seem liked well enough.

46:26.074 --> 46:29.286
Do not mistake this decision for fondness.
It is pure strategy.

46:29.369 --> 46:31.163
I'd never think
you had affections for another.

46:31.246 --> 46:32.790
It'd make me far too jealous, my lady.

46:32.873 --> 46:34.541
Save your charms for the investors.

46:34.625 --> 46:36.627
Why? I have plenty to spare.

46:36.710 --> 46:39.922
My lord,
your lies are wasted on me.

46:40.005 --> 46:41.590
I do not need to lie.

46:41.673 --> 46:44.301
You are far too cunning
to fall prey to that, are you not?

46:45.761 --> 46:47.596
You and I see the truth.

46:47.679 --> 46:50.474
That is why this is
such a promising partnership.

46:51.475 --> 46:53.727
I see you for the capable woman you are.

46:55.687 --> 46:58.357
My cousin was a fool about many things

46:59.316 --> 47:00.943
but none greater than
in leaving this world

47:01.026 --> 47:02.986
knowing he had
a brilliant wife still in it.

47:08.700 --> 47:09.701
We must

47:11.078 --> 47:14.248
return to the gardens
before we are missed.

47:15.874 --> 47:17.042
After you.

47:26.009 --> 47:29.346
I must thank Your Majesty
for such a splendid event.

47:29.429 --> 47:33.600
Every detail.
It simply takes one's breath away and--

47:33.684 --> 47:37.437
While I quite enjoy
the adulation, Lady Bridgerton,

47:37.521 --> 47:40.315
unless you are here to tell me
that your son and his bride

47:40.399 --> 47:44.528
are at present standing at that altar,
I simply do not have the time.

47:44.611 --> 47:47.489
For this wedding to fail is unacceptable.

47:48.532 --> 47:50.409
Lady Danbury, what have you to say?

47:50.492 --> 47:52.703
As always, Your Majesty, I am humbled

47:52.786 --> 47:55.706
by your generosity of spirit.

47:55.789 --> 47:57.040
Though, uh…

47:58.876 --> 48:00.085
Though…

48:00.168 --> 48:03.297
It is unlike you
to lose your words, Lady Danbury.

48:04.464 --> 48:06.258
Though it pains us so,

48:06.341 --> 48:09.136
both Lady Bridgerton
and I are in agreement

48:09.219 --> 48:12.931
that it is up to Miss Edwina
to decide her fate.

48:13.432 --> 48:14.766
Well.

48:14.850 --> 48:17.978
I did not realize
the diamond outweighed the Crown.

48:18.061 --> 48:19.730
It does not, Your Majesty.

48:20.814 --> 48:22.733
Pardon our interruption,
Your Majesty.

48:22.816 --> 48:24.318
It is noted.

48:24.401 --> 48:26.028
To be sure.

48:26.111 --> 48:28.697
I do hope my efforts today
have not been wasted.

48:28.780 --> 48:32.075
It has not been a waste, Your Majesty.

48:32.159 --> 48:35.454
But rather further proof of the love
you have for your people, ma'am.

48:35.537 --> 48:38.498
Miss Edwina and I come
before you humbly now

48:38.582 --> 48:40.250
in recognition of all that you--

48:40.334 --> 48:43.879
Is there not a person alive who can think
of something else to say to their queen

48:43.962 --> 48:45.923
other than sheer flattery?

48:47.382 --> 48:49.009
It is the obvious choice.

48:50.218 --> 48:51.428
Child.

48:51.511 --> 48:54.598
Are you here to tell me
you are going to marry him or not?

49:00.729 --> 49:02.105
Did you see them?

49:02.189 --> 49:03.982
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

49:04.066 --> 49:05.400
The fireworks?

49:05.484 --> 49:07.361
They were brilliant!

49:08.904 --> 49:10.322
Will there be more?

49:11.740 --> 49:12.741
Oh, dear. It seems…

49:13.867 --> 49:16.078
It seems I am late for the ceremony.

49:16.662 --> 49:17.704
My king.

49:18.956 --> 49:21.792
Someone. Can someone come and assist?

49:21.875 --> 49:23.627
I didn't mean to keep you waiting, Lottie.

49:24.336 --> 49:27.089
My bride. My… My beautiful bride.

49:27.172 --> 49:30.550
Um, but where is the archbishop

49:30.634 --> 49:33.136
and-and-and-and our congregation?

49:36.181 --> 49:37.015
George.

49:37.099 --> 49:39.726
She is radiant, is she not?

49:41.061 --> 49:42.104
What are they, uh…

49:42.604 --> 49:44.523
What-- What are they doing?

49:44.606 --> 49:47.484
Stop! Leave! Leave me! Leave me!

49:47.567 --> 49:48.443
Lottie…

49:58.328 --> 50:00.706
She will make a most excellent queen,

50:01.456 --> 50:02.457
Your Majesty.

50:05.669 --> 50:09.214
I hear the two of you faced many trials

50:09.297 --> 50:11.008
during your happy courtship.

50:12.217 --> 50:13.301
But today…

50:16.096 --> 50:19.725
Today will make all of it
well worth it, will it not?

50:22.477 --> 50:24.229
Why… yes.

50:24.312 --> 50:27.482
Then perhaps you might
find your rest, Your Majesty,

50:28.191 --> 50:30.277
before you both rule this kingdom

50:30.360 --> 50:34.448
with the kind of love,
compassion, and kindness

50:34.531 --> 50:36.700
the two of you undoubtedly share.

50:42.914 --> 50:43.874
My queen.

51:05.645 --> 51:06.938
Oh, Edwina…

51:38.095 --> 51:39.429
A celebratory drink?

51:40.055 --> 51:41.765
Have you succeeded already, Colin?

51:42.432 --> 51:45.644
Only if whatever I am looking for
can be found at the bottom of this flask.

51:45.727 --> 51:47.687
I am certain you will find
your purpose one day.

51:47.771 --> 51:49.439
Everyone must eventually.

51:49.523 --> 51:51.775
-Have you found yours?
-Of course not.

51:52.818 --> 51:57.572
But I imagine it to be something
both animating and satisfying.

51:58.156 --> 52:00.617
The type of venture
that speaks not to who I am

52:00.700 --> 52:03.078
but rather who I am to be.

52:04.287 --> 52:07.457
My purpose will challenge me
to be brave and witty.

52:07.541 --> 52:09.751
My purpose will propel me

52:09.835 --> 52:12.254
far beyond the watchful glare of my mama.

52:12.337 --> 52:13.797
My purpose

52:14.840 --> 52:16.258
shall set me free.

52:17.634 --> 52:19.553
What could possibly
measure up to all that?

52:21.972 --> 52:24.141
Your dreams are grander
than you let on, Pen.

52:24.224 --> 52:27.519
Yes, they are mere fantasies, but

52:28.395 --> 52:31.439
I do believe we must
allow ourselves those private moments

52:32.107 --> 52:34.818
so we may face reality
armed with our reveries.

52:38.238 --> 52:40.407
Lady Crane was right about you.

52:40.490 --> 52:41.700
Lady Crane?

52:42.659 --> 52:43.952
What did she say?

52:44.536 --> 52:45.912
That you cared for me.

52:46.746 --> 52:49.124
That you would never forsake me.

52:50.750 --> 52:52.836
I am beginning to believe that now.

53:02.596 --> 53:05.849
It appears we had better nab
a piece of cake before it's all gone.

53:19.112 --> 53:20.071
El?

53:21.990 --> 53:25.076
-El, whatever are you--
-I've made a decision to visit Theo now.

53:25.160 --> 53:27.412
Eloise, it is your brother's wedding.
People will notice.

53:27.495 --> 53:28.496
This is why no one will.

53:28.580 --> 53:31.541
Everyone is worried about Anthony
and Miss Edwina. They'll hardly miss me.

53:31.625 --> 53:34.377
Because an opportunity presents
itself does not mean you should take it.

53:34.461 --> 53:36.796
There are other things to do.
Have you seen the peacocks?

53:36.880 --> 53:40.467
It is vexing to think only of his thoughts
when I should be thinking of my own.

53:40.550 --> 53:41.384
I…

53:42.302 --> 53:44.304
-I do not know what to say.
-Say nothing.

53:44.888 --> 53:45.972
That is all I ask.

53:46.640 --> 53:48.683
I am only telling you now
because you are my friend,

53:48.767 --> 53:51.019
and I do not wish
for secrets to set us apart.

54:23.510 --> 54:26.054
-Do you like that one?
-Your Majesty, I--

54:26.137 --> 54:29.182
I wore it
for His Majesty's golden jubilee.

54:29.683 --> 54:31.184
Here.

54:32.227 --> 54:34.938
-Oh, I could not possibly--
-Yes, you could.

54:43.863 --> 54:44.906
Miss Edwina.

54:45.907 --> 54:49.286
I chose you
as the season's diamond for a reason.

54:49.369 --> 54:51.621
Yes, you possess great beauty, but

54:52.664 --> 54:54.291
you made an impression.

54:55.166 --> 54:58.003
You still do. And you still can.

54:58.586 --> 55:00.422
Even after all the confusion of the day.

55:01.006 --> 55:03.008
And after, most especially,

55:03.091 --> 55:06.052
all that has been witnessed in private.

55:06.970 --> 55:11.224
All that I have witnessed, ma'am,
is the love a king shares with his queen,

55:11.308 --> 55:13.184
and nothing more.

55:13.268 --> 55:16.104
I should certainly not find
the proper words to discuss it

55:16.187 --> 55:18.356
even if given
a million lifetimes to do so.

55:18.440 --> 55:19.566
Hmm.

55:20.608 --> 55:23.695
The challenge
of the Crown is that it is tangible.

55:24.237 --> 55:26.740
It is a physical reminder of the position.

55:27.407 --> 55:29.951
It is why, say, Lady Whistledown
circulates her pamphlets

55:30.035 --> 55:32.037
instead of trading in whispered rumor.

55:32.120 --> 55:34.914
A whisper is relevant
for only as long as it is spoken,

55:34.998 --> 55:37.000
but a paper represents more.

55:37.584 --> 55:40.211
Its physical form grants permanence.

55:40.295 --> 55:42.464
The same cannot be said
of true love, of course.

55:43.089 --> 55:45.258
It changes. It forgets.

55:46.009 --> 55:49.054
It forces you to remember
who you once were.

55:50.055 --> 55:52.807
And it forces you
to choose how you will live with it,

55:52.891 --> 55:53.892
again and again.

55:55.810 --> 55:57.604
How does one make that choice?

55:59.689 --> 56:01.649
That, I cannot dictate.

56:03.360 --> 56:04.736
I am your queen,

56:06.029 --> 56:09.699
but I suppose even I must recognize
the importance of each person deciding

56:09.783 --> 56:12.243
what to do in the face of true love.

56:13.036 --> 56:15.288
Everyone deserves to make that choice

56:15.830 --> 56:19.084
just as everyone
deserves to feel its power.

56:19.876 --> 56:20.960
But one must know…

56:23.171 --> 56:27.133
it is the hardest
and greatest choice one can ever make.

56:30.261 --> 56:34.265
<i>It is a distinctly human act to marry.</i>

56:40.021 --> 56:43.733
<i>Animals require no contracts or dowries.</i>

56:53.410 --> 56:57.038
<i>The hen and the rooster make no vows.</i>

57:22.272 --> 57:23.731
You sent word for me?

57:24.941 --> 57:26.526
I thought <i>you</i> sent word for <i>me.</i>

57:39.747 --> 57:41.583
I have made my decision.

57:41.666 --> 57:43.710
I thought it best
you both hear it from me.

57:43.793 --> 57:45.545
Edwina, we should speak in private.

57:46.254 --> 57:49.048
I cannot marry you, Lord Bridgerton.

57:50.133 --> 57:52.927
You cannot provide me
with what it is that I want.

57:54.804 --> 57:56.806
What it is that I <i>deserve.</i>

57:57.557 --> 57:59.642
What <i>everyone</i> deserves.

58:01.019 --> 58:03.438
I may not know exactly
what true love feels like

58:03.521 --> 58:05.940
but I certainly know what it is not.

58:07.567 --> 58:09.194
It is not deception,

58:10.445 --> 58:12.155
or wandering eyes,

58:12.822 --> 58:15.742
or a role to be fulfilled.

58:16.993 --> 58:21.039
I cannot marry you
because I cannot betray myself.

58:21.122 --> 58:23.750
You will never meet my eyes
in the same manner

58:23.833 --> 58:26.836
that you met my sister's
on that altar today. You will never…

58:29.881 --> 58:31.799
You will never look at me the same way.

58:38.139 --> 58:42.644
You say you have spent your life
trying to give me everything I lacked,

58:42.727 --> 58:47.565
but really, you simply gave me
everything you really wanted for yourself,

58:47.649 --> 58:49.734
as though my life were not my own.

58:49.817 --> 58:52.278
I did not ask for <i>any </i>of it, Kate.

58:54.239 --> 58:55.532
So, today,

58:55.615 --> 58:58.910
I can be sure that
what I leave behind is not <i>my</i> loss.

58:59.494 --> 59:00.620
It is yours.

59:01.454 --> 59:06.501
Your dream, your plan,
your feelings that I had merely borrowed.

59:07.585 --> 59:08.461
Today,

59:09.170 --> 59:11.214
you have lost your power,

59:12.215 --> 59:14.008
while I have made up my own mind.

59:16.636 --> 59:18.513
And that is victory enough for me.

59:30.733 --> 59:33.987
<i>Leave it to people to complicate matters</i>

59:34.070 --> 59:37.365
<i>with their ceremonies and their cakes.</i>

59:37.991 --> 59:40.743
<i>Is it not a wonder</i>
<i>that anyone marries at all?</i>

59:40.827 --> 59:44.330
It is not as if Miss Edwina
could do any better than the viscount.

59:44.414 --> 59:46.958
Perhaps it is for that very reason
she changed her mind.

59:47.041 --> 59:48.668
She knows she is not worthy of him.

59:48.751 --> 59:51.337
Or perhaps we might judge
the viscount anew.

59:51.421 --> 59:55.508
Perhaps Miss Edwina discovered something
the rest of us might wish to know of too.

1:00:01.306 --> 1:00:03.474
-Oh, Your Grace.
-Duchess.

1:00:03.558 --> 1:00:06.561
-Shall we make our way home, Mama?
-I believe we shall.

1:00:07.645 --> 1:00:12.650
<i>Indeed, some may call</i>
<i>a wedding the ultimate act of faith.</i>

1:00:13.401 --> 1:00:15.153
<i>While others would venture</i>

1:00:15.236 --> 1:00:19.073
<i>that it is the ultimate act of fools.</i>

1:00:20.241 --> 1:00:23.703
You've come quite a long way
to ask me something, so go on.

1:00:25.496 --> 1:00:26.831
I have thoughts.

1:00:27.999 --> 1:00:30.960
I can see how that might
pose a problem for someone in your world.

1:00:31.044 --> 1:00:34.255
Thoughts I would like to share…
with you.

1:00:34.339 --> 1:00:36.049
And are you not sharing them now?

1:00:36.132 --> 1:00:39.719
What I am failing to say is that often,

1:00:40.678 --> 1:00:42.388
when I read something new or

1:00:43.640 --> 1:00:45.808
interesting or provoking,

1:00:47.060 --> 1:00:48.895
it is you who crosses my mind.

1:00:49.562 --> 1:00:53.483
It is you I would like
to speak with about those thoughts.

1:00:57.695 --> 1:00:58.529
I see.

1:01:00.490 --> 1:01:01.324
Uh…

1:01:01.407 --> 1:01:03.951
And so I am wondering if

1:01:04.035 --> 1:01:06.913
you might also have thoughts of me

1:01:06.996 --> 1:01:08.373
when you think.

1:01:25.390 --> 1:01:27.433
I have read all of these.

1:01:30.103 --> 1:01:30.937
And?

1:01:32.021 --> 1:01:32.897
And…

1:01:34.774 --> 1:01:36.275
I set them aside for you.

1:01:38.152 --> 1:01:40.738
I thought perhaps you might

1:01:41.614 --> 1:01:43.366
share your thoughts on them.

1:01:48.413 --> 1:01:51.124
<i>Eagerly awaiting two words.</i>

1:01:52.291 --> 1:01:53.710
<i>"I do."</i>

1:01:53.793 --> 1:01:57.296
<i>Bride and groom declare intention alone,</i>

1:01:57.380 --> 1:02:00.633
<i>with no guarantee of happiness.</i>

1:02:03.678 --> 1:02:06.723
All is not lost today, ma'am.
I have received word.

1:02:07.557 --> 1:02:09.809
It had better be a worthy distraction.

1:02:10.393 --> 1:02:13.354
Our trap for Lady Whistledown
has indeed produced a result.

1:02:19.402 --> 1:02:23.239
<i>Marriage amounts</i>
<i>to little more than human ritual.</i>

1:02:24.323 --> 1:02:29.328
<i>We may not force the rooster or hen,</i>
<i>yet we continue to collect eggs.</i>

1:02:30.121 --> 1:02:32.540
<i>Does that make us more complicated,</i>

1:02:32.623 --> 1:02:37.086
<i>or simply too stubborn</i>
<i>to believe that we must orchestrate</i>

1:02:37.170 --> 1:02:39.797
<i>what nature has already ordained?</i>

1:02:42.633 --> 1:02:44.135
I suppose we ought to go.

1:02:48.097 --> 1:02:49.182
Lord Bridgerton?

1:02:54.187 --> 1:02:57.023
Your sister is braver
and wiser than us both.

1:02:57.815 --> 1:03:00.067
She had the courage to act on
what she sensed between us.

1:03:00.151 --> 1:03:00.985
And here we are,

1:03:01.903 --> 1:03:03.488
standing perfectly still…

1:03:05.364 --> 1:03:06.949
having felt it for months.

1:03:09.410 --> 1:03:10.620
I stand here…

1:03:13.748 --> 1:03:15.374
because the moment we go…

1:03:18.753 --> 1:03:21.380
the moment we step foot
outside those doors…

1:03:25.384 --> 1:03:26.636
we face the truth.

1:03:26.719 --> 1:03:28.262
Of our situations?

1:03:28.346 --> 1:03:30.014
Of our failures.

1:03:30.097 --> 1:03:32.183
We have indeed failed, my lord.

1:03:32.809 --> 1:03:34.060
Of our duties.

1:03:35.144 --> 1:03:36.646
Of our responsibilities.

1:03:37.480 --> 1:03:38.856
We have failed at it all.

1:03:41.609 --> 1:03:42.902
So forgive me

1:03:43.653 --> 1:03:45.404
if it is now my wish…

1:03:48.115 --> 1:03:49.367
to suspend time.

1:03:50.618 --> 1:03:52.161
To delay the inevitable.

1:03:52.954 --> 1:03:54.372
To for a mere moment,

1:03:55.081 --> 1:03:57.166
not think of what comes next.

1:04:00.628 --> 1:04:01.504
To wait.

1:04:16.018 --> 1:04:17.270
Goodbye, my lord.
