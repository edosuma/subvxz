00:03.177 --> 00:05.005
NEWSMAN: ...was very sorry for
the plane's unauthorized landing

00:05.048 --> 00:06.702
and the death
of the Chinese pilot.

00:06.745 --> 00:10.793
The plane left Guam...What are you still doing here?

00:10.836 --> 00:12.708
What do you mean?

00:12.751 --> 00:13.752
Well, don't you have school?

00:13.796 --> 00:15.015
Nope.

00:15.058 --> 00:16.625
What about work?

00:16.668 --> 00:18.975
I killed myself studying
for the LSATs.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.846
I'm taking a few days off.

00:20.890 --> 00:22.979
So you're just gonna be...

00:23.023 --> 00:24.111
here?

00:24.154 --> 00:25.895
That's the plan.

00:25.938 --> 00:26.939
Huh.

00:26.983 --> 00:28.550
What's shedoing home?

00:29.725 --> 00:31.074
She's taking a few days off.

00:31.118 --> 00:33.990
So she's just gonna be... here?

00:35.426 --> 00:37.733
Am I really that big
of a monkey wrench?

00:37.776 --> 00:40.214
No, don't be silly.
Listen, I'm gonna split.

00:41.432 --> 00:42.694
Sorry, honey.

00:42.738 --> 00:44.740
I'm as blindsided
as you are.

00:44.783 --> 00:47.090
Adam, I didn't mean
to chase you out.

00:47.134 --> 00:50.006
Oh, no, it's not about you,
Christy. Call me if she leaves.

00:52.661 --> 00:54.706
What the hell goes on here
when I'm gone?

00:54.750 --> 00:55.968
Don't ask the question

00:56.012 --> 00:57.405
if you don't want to
picture the answer.

00:57.448 --> 00:59.885
I watch The View
at 11:00.

00:59.929 --> 01:01.974
Is that gonna
be a problem?

01:02.018 --> 01:03.106
Can I watch with you?

01:03.150 --> 01:04.847
[groans][knocking]

01:04.890 --> 01:06.718
Geez. Now there's
someone at the door?

01:06.762 --> 01:08.807
This day is a disaster.

01:10.809 --> 01:13.899
Yeah?I'm sorry to bother you.
Are you the building manager?

01:13.943 --> 01:16.250
Maybe. You a cop?Do I look like a cop?

01:16.293 --> 01:18.078
The good ones don't.

01:18.121 --> 01:19.992
Well, actually, I saw
the vacancy sign out front,

01:20.036 --> 01:21.342
and I'm interested
in the apartment.

01:21.385 --> 01:22.908
Oh, great.
Two bedroom, two bath,

01:22.952 --> 01:24.606
first and last,
you know the drill.

01:24.649 --> 01:25.998
Can you be any more specific?

01:26.042 --> 01:28.436
Uh, square footage,
building amenities?

01:28.479 --> 01:30.612
Square footage,
I would say medium.

01:30.655 --> 01:31.874
And, uh,
as for amenities,

01:31.917 --> 01:34.137
there's a weird guy
on the third floor

01:34.181 --> 01:36.139
who'll rub your feet
if you let him.

01:36.183 --> 01:38.228
I have a dog.
Is that okay?

01:38.272 --> 01:39.969
The building owner
doesn't allow pets,

01:40.012 --> 01:43.059
but if you slip me 50 bucks,
we never had this conversation.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.756
So it'll be our little secret?

01:44.800 --> 01:46.149
What? Who?

01:46.193 --> 01:48.760
See? That's what your $50 buys.

01:48.804 --> 01:50.588
Well, this has been fun.

01:50.632 --> 01:51.937
I'm Rita Gennaro,

01:51.981 --> 01:53.983
the new owner of this building,

01:54.026 --> 01:56.768
and we are off
to a very poor start.

01:58.030 --> 02:00.294
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

02:01.947 --> 02:04.515
What is wrong with you?I don't know. I panicked.

02:04.559 --> 02:06.778
You threw my whole day off.

02:07.823 --> 02:09.825
â™ª

02:25.232 --> 02:27.277
Here you go.
If it's not how you like it,

02:27.321 --> 02:29.497
I'll make a new pot.

02:29.540 --> 02:31.412
Please don't fire
my mother.

02:31.455 --> 02:33.022
You're sweet. We'll see.

02:34.502 --> 02:36.808
So, how'd you end up
owning the building?

02:36.852 --> 02:38.810
What happened to Tony,
who I never saw

02:38.854 --> 02:41.073
except when he brought me
my Christmas bonus?

02:41.117 --> 02:43.511
My husband ran off
with a home-wrecking slut.

02:43.554 --> 02:45.643
Oh, no.
Well, does that mean

02:45.687 --> 02:47.689
you'llbe bringing me
my Christmas bonus?

02:48.907 --> 02:50.474
You know,
I'm divorced, too,

02:50.518 --> 02:52.389
so I know what
you're wrestling with.

02:52.433 --> 02:53.869
Do I care about your life?

02:53.912 --> 02:57.612
Nope. No, you don't,
and you shouldn't.

02:57.655 --> 03:01.181
So, what went down with Tony,
whose toupee is no secret?

03:07.709 --> 03:09.667
He woke up one day and told me,

03:09.711 --> 03:11.669
"I'm leaving you
for the dry cleaner."

03:11.713 --> 03:13.454
I just thought he
was announcing his errands

03:13.497 --> 03:15.847
in a very formal way.

03:15.891 --> 03:18.198
And then my world fell apart.

03:18.241 --> 03:19.721
Your dry cleaner
is a woman?

03:19.764 --> 03:22.332
That's the interesting part
of the story for you?

03:22.376 --> 03:24.682
You just don't see it
that often.

03:24.726 --> 03:26.597
It's like a kindergarten teacher
who's a man.

03:26.641 --> 03:27.903
Not wrong, just weird.

03:27.946 --> 03:30.514
Do you get money
from the state to keep her?

03:30.558 --> 03:33.691
I should, shouldn't I?

03:33.735 --> 03:35.127
Well, Rita,
this has been a treat.

03:35.171 --> 03:36.912
Definitely pop in
every couple of months.

03:36.955 --> 03:38.392
We'd love to see you.

03:38.435 --> 03:40.481
I'm not done.And she's not done.

03:40.524 --> 03:43.484
I want this building
to generate income,

03:43.527 --> 03:45.747
and if we clean it up,
I can raise the rent.

03:45.790 --> 03:48.706
I could understand if he left me
for some hot young thing,

03:48.750 --> 03:50.099
but she's a tubby seamstress

03:50.142 --> 03:52.188
with a mole
the size of Coney Island.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.494
So sorry you're
going through

03:53.537 --> 03:55.278
such a...Are we friends all of a sudden?

03:55.322 --> 03:56.497
Well, I thought
we shared a moment.

03:56.540 --> 03:58.890
We didn't.

03:58.934 --> 04:01.545
Now, I got a list of things
I need you to take care of.

04:01.589 --> 04:03.721
Yikes. Both sides,
huh? [chuckles]

04:03.765 --> 04:05.854
Can I hire someone
to do this work?

04:05.897 --> 04:07.595
I already did hire someone.

04:07.638 --> 04:08.900
Oh, great.

04:09.901 --> 04:11.642
Oh.

04:11.686 --> 04:15.472
I'll be back Friday to
check on the progress.

04:15.516 --> 04:17.169
Or you could go
on a long cruise.

04:17.213 --> 04:19.476
Lot of people get a second
chance of love on those things.

04:19.520 --> 04:21.870
Friday!Cruise!

04:23.915 --> 04:26.744
Let me show you what I think
about this list.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.226
What is the matter with you?

04:30.270 --> 04:32.315
If she fires you,
we lose our home.

04:32.359 --> 04:33.490
[ringtone plays]

04:33.534 --> 04:34.839
Hold that thought.

04:34.883 --> 04:37.059
Hi, honey.

04:38.060 --> 04:41.411
Yeah, she's still here.

04:47.983 --> 04:49.637
Oh, my God.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.421
Are you actually
working on the list?

04:51.465 --> 04:52.944
Yeah. I got to thinking

04:52.988 --> 04:54.642
if I do one or two
of the easy ones,

04:54.685 --> 04:56.600
it'll get her
off of my ass for a while.

04:56.644 --> 04:58.080
Is that duct tape?

04:58.123 --> 04:59.908
Hey, I've never used
a hammer here.

04:59.951 --> 05:02.519
I'm not gonna break
my streak now.

05:03.564 --> 05:05.043
Well, at least I have

05:05.087 --> 05:07.307
a nice, new car to live in.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.700
Come on, baby.

05:09.744 --> 05:11.702
Just till Friday.

05:14.749 --> 05:16.141
Hey, watch your step,
Mr. Munson.

05:16.185 --> 05:17.447
I'm on a ladder over here.

05:17.491 --> 05:20.581
Let me guess,
you're finally hanging yourself?

05:22.670 --> 05:24.498
Not yet.

05:24.541 --> 05:27.327
I'm doing repairs
around the building.

05:27.370 --> 05:29.851
I figured you'd hang yourself
before you did that.

05:29.894 --> 05:32.332
Ha-ha-ha.Hmm.

05:32.375 --> 05:34.638
I'm coming up in a couple hours
to install your smoke detector,

05:34.682 --> 05:36.031
so make sure
you're wearing pants.

05:36.074 --> 05:38.120
I could say the same thing
to you.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.696
Get ready, Match.com.

05:48.739 --> 05:49.914
[knock at door]

05:49.958 --> 05:51.481
[camera clicks]

05:53.309 --> 05:55.572
Whoa, that's a lot of nose.

06:00.142 --> 06:01.491
Rita, hi.

06:01.535 --> 06:04.320
Oh, look who's a girl.

06:04.364 --> 06:07.497
Yeah, I'm just trying
to take a picture

06:07.541 --> 06:08.759
for a dating site.

06:08.803 --> 06:10.631
I found my son doing
that same thing.

06:10.674 --> 06:12.981
His makeup was more subtle.

06:13.024 --> 06:15.679
Well, I recently broke up
with someone,

06:15.723 --> 06:18.029
so, you know, I'm trying
to get back out there and...

06:18.073 --> 06:19.553
We're not bonding here.

06:20.945 --> 06:22.817
I found another leak
in the laundry room.

06:22.860 --> 06:24.819
The banister on the back
staircase is loose.

06:24.862 --> 06:26.211
Why aren't you
writing this down?

06:26.255 --> 06:27.561
Okay.

06:29.606 --> 06:33.610
Leak, banister.

06:33.654 --> 06:35.003
Anything else?

06:35.046 --> 06:37.353
Would I keep it a secret?

06:37.397 --> 06:39.355
Right.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.488
Hey, listen, um,

06:41.531 --> 06:43.881
I know this is a little weird,
but since you're here,

06:43.925 --> 06:45.753
could you help me get a picture?

06:45.796 --> 06:48.582
My arms aren't long enough
to make my nose look normal.

06:48.625 --> 06:50.453
Okay.

06:50.497 --> 06:52.586
I want to look pretty,
but not slutty.

06:52.629 --> 06:54.544
Available, but not desperate.

06:54.588 --> 06:56.154
Smart, but not...There.

06:57.199 --> 06:59.854
But I wasn't quite...

06:59.897 --> 07:02.247
Wow, that's perfect.

07:02.291 --> 07:03.553
I hope you find someone quickly

07:03.597 --> 07:05.294
because at the rate
your mother's going,

07:05.337 --> 07:07.470
you're going to need to find
a new place to live.

07:07.514 --> 07:10.255
No, no, no, no,
she is trying so hard.

07:10.299 --> 07:12.083
She really does love this job.

07:12.127 --> 07:13.433
And my husband loved me.

07:13.476 --> 07:14.651
Things change.

07:16.087 --> 07:18.220
Tell your mother

07:18.263 --> 07:20.788
if she doesn't complete
the repairs in three days,

07:20.831 --> 07:21.919
she's out.

07:21.963 --> 07:23.834
But if you kick her out,

07:23.878 --> 07:25.488
you're gonna
have to kick me out.

07:25.532 --> 07:28.578
Maybe the new building manager
can let you live with them.

07:28.622 --> 07:31.015
You could be like the cat
that comes with the apartment.

07:31.059 --> 07:33.975
No, no, she's gonna do it.
You'll see.

07:34.018 --> 07:36.717
She's not nearly as incompetent
as you might think.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.678
Was that the light?

07:41.722 --> 07:43.375
I'm adding it to the list.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.466
Oh!

07:48.380 --> 07:49.512
Is she gone?

07:49.556 --> 07:50.818
Where'd you come from?

07:50.861 --> 07:52.994
I saw her car out front,
so I snuck around back.

07:53.037 --> 07:54.561
Corn dog?

07:55.910 --> 07:58.042
Ah, look at this.

07:58.086 --> 08:01.524
"Take pictures of work when
you're finished and send to me"?

08:01.568 --> 08:03.570
Who does she think she is?

08:03.613 --> 08:05.528
I got your first
picture right here.

08:05.572 --> 08:08.139
Mom.Oh, right.

08:08.183 --> 08:09.837
Whoa!
No!
No!

08:09.880 --> 08:12.230
Oh. You mean don't do it.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.146
Sorry, Bonnie,
but I'm with Rita.

08:15.190 --> 08:16.974
If I don't crack the
whip with my staff,

08:17.018 --> 08:18.759
my swans will
never get fed.

08:18.802 --> 08:22.545
Oh, you and your
relatable problems.

08:22.589 --> 08:25.592
You've been managing
this building for four years.

08:25.635 --> 08:28.551
You know the job. Why are you
fighting so hard against it?

08:28.595 --> 08:31.423
Oh, look who's found something
to sink her dentures into.

08:31.467 --> 08:34.165
And I already ordered,
so I can't leave.

08:34.209 --> 08:35.645
Why are you sweating
about this?

08:35.689 --> 08:37.560
Just do your job.

08:37.604 --> 08:40.520
Says the woman whose
only job is shopping.

08:40.563 --> 08:41.912
Hey, I am at those stores

08:41.956 --> 08:43.610
every morning at 10:00 a.m.
when they open up.

08:45.133 --> 08:46.874
I would've fired you
days ago.

08:46.917 --> 08:48.658
I would've fired her years
ago.

08:48.702 --> 08:50.878
I would've never hired
her in the first place.You know what,

08:50.921 --> 08:53.271
I don't have to sit here and
listen to this. Screw you all.

08:53.315 --> 08:55.926
Waitress, I'd like my
taco bowl in the bathroom.

09:00.278 --> 09:02.585
[exhales]

09:03.630 --> 09:05.849
Well, this was not a good plan.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.157
Bonnie...

09:09.200 --> 09:11.551
No.

09:11.594 --> 09:14.597
Why do I keep locking myself
into smaller spaces?

09:14.641 --> 09:16.468
Go away!

09:16.512 --> 09:18.558
I'm not going anywhere.

09:18.601 --> 09:20.560
Well, then I guess
I live here now.

09:20.603 --> 09:22.300
What are you doing, Bonnie?

09:22.344 --> 09:23.998
Oh, don't go all Marjorie
on me please.

09:24.041 --> 09:25.303
I hate my boss.

09:25.347 --> 09:26.870
There's no underlying
blah, blah, blah.

09:26.914 --> 09:29.438
Oh, there's always
underlying blah, blah, blah.

09:29.481 --> 09:31.614
Are you trying
to blow up your life?

09:31.658 --> 09:32.615
No!

09:32.659 --> 09:34.704
Okay, let's play a game.

09:34.748 --> 09:36.576
Pretend I'm your boss.Good-bye.

09:36.619 --> 09:39.448
That job puts a roof
over your head.

09:39.491 --> 09:41.493
Why are you so resistant
to doing it?

09:41.537 --> 09:43.234
Because I hate it!

09:43.278 --> 09:44.540
It's humiliating!

09:44.584 --> 09:46.586
I'm in my 50s,
and I'm plunging toilets.

09:46.629 --> 09:49.458
This was not the dream, Marge.Okay, what is the dream?

09:49.501 --> 09:51.025
Well, I don't know,
but it doesn't involve

09:51.068 --> 09:53.244
chasing raccoons
out of a garbage closet.

09:53.288 --> 09:54.637
But that is the job.

09:54.681 --> 09:56.247
Right. And if I do it well,

09:56.291 --> 09:57.771
then I'll be doing it
for the rest of my life,

09:57.814 --> 09:59.816
and then that's just who I am.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.644
[exhales] Damn it,

10:01.688 --> 10:05.387
we just found the underlying
blah, blah, blah.

10:05.430 --> 10:07.694
Look, you might not be doing
what you want to

10:07.737 --> 10:09.609
with your life,
but that's not Rita's fault.

10:09.652 --> 10:11.436
[scoffs] Shut up.

10:11.480 --> 10:14.439
Bonnie, the job
isn't who you are.

10:14.483 --> 10:15.527
It's just what you're doing

10:15.571 --> 10:17.268
on the road to what
you're gonna be.

10:17.312 --> 10:19.314
[sighs] I said shut up.

10:21.316 --> 10:24.449
Did you actually
want this in here?

10:25.712 --> 10:27.496
No fork?
What am I, an animal?

10:35.069 --> 10:36.418
Got to say, these things
are a lot easier

10:36.461 --> 10:37.767
to drag without a body inside.

10:41.858 --> 10:43.425
Adam, what the hell
are you doing?

10:43.468 --> 10:45.296
Fixing the fountain.

10:45.340 --> 10:47.647
All I said was
clean out the leaves.

10:47.690 --> 10:50.214
I told you above and beyond
makes her mad.

10:50.258 --> 10:52.564
I just think
if this was level

10:52.608 --> 10:53.783
and the tubing was replaced,

10:53.827 --> 10:55.132
that I could
get it working again.

10:55.176 --> 10:56.481
You could even
have fish in here.

10:56.525 --> 10:59.049
Fish? She barely kept me alive.

10:59.093 --> 11:01.356
What will you talk about

11:01.399 --> 11:03.401
when you finally forgive me
for the past?

11:03.445 --> 11:05.490
I'm not overly concerned.

11:05.534 --> 11:08.232
Just shove that thing
back on the wall.

11:08.276 --> 11:09.669
Hey, you know,
don't ask for my help

11:09.712 --> 11:11.235
if you don't want
the job done right.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.498
Oh, God,
Rita's coming.

11:13.542 --> 11:14.761
How do you know?

11:14.804 --> 11:16.937
All the birds just
flew out of that tree.

11:19.026 --> 11:23.247
Rita, hi. What a lovely
giant flower sweater.

11:27.034 --> 11:30.341
I thought I made it clear
I'm not paying for extra help.

11:30.385 --> 11:32.517
Oh, don't worry, I pay him
in sex and her in Doritos.

11:33.736 --> 11:36.434
Cool Ranch, family size.

11:36.478 --> 11:39.437
So you two
are together?

11:39.481 --> 11:40.830
Yes, this is Adam,
my fiancÃ©.

11:40.874 --> 11:42.876
Hi, good to meet you...Let me see the ring.

11:42.919 --> 11:47.445
Nice. Just be careful
where you send his shirts.

11:47.489 --> 11:50.492
Rita, I want
to apologize

11:50.535 --> 11:52.233
if I seemed
a little resistant

11:52.276 --> 11:56.454
to what are obviously necessary
upgrades to our lovely building.

11:56.498 --> 11:58.935
You are the boss,
so what you say goes.

11:58.979 --> 12:00.763
Thank you for understanding

12:00.807 --> 12:03.592
what everyone else who has a job
already understands.

12:03.635 --> 12:05.463
[phone chimes]

12:05.507 --> 12:09.598
Oh, my God, I got a match
on Match. I matched.

12:09.641 --> 12:11.339
Is it desperate
if I call him right now?

12:11.382 --> 12:13.167
I don't, I don't care.

12:13.210 --> 12:16.344
You've done such
a wonderful job with her.

12:16.387 --> 12:18.346
Now, I've been looking over
the rent receipts

12:18.389 --> 12:21.349
and we have a few tenants
that are behind.

12:21.392 --> 12:23.655
Anyone who owes
more than two months,

12:23.699 --> 12:25.092
get the money or evict them.

12:25.135 --> 12:26.571
Not a problem.

12:26.615 --> 12:28.443
I have some experience
shaking down people for money.

12:29.357 --> 12:32.708
As part of my extensive...
charity work.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.667
Yes, that fits perfectly with
everything I know about you.

12:35.711 --> 12:38.975
[chuckles]
Funny one, boss.

12:39.019 --> 12:41.586
I'll find out
whose bike that is.

12:44.546 --> 12:47.592
Wow, Bonnie,
you handled that great.

12:47.636 --> 12:50.204
Oh, good, you're impressed.
What the hell do I care?

12:50.247 --> 12:51.553
Why are you snapping at me?

12:51.596 --> 12:53.294
Because I can't snap at her.

12:53.337 --> 12:56.079
I love you, you're sweet.

12:56.123 --> 12:57.428
CHRISTY:
Hey.

12:57.472 --> 12:59.387
Quick question,
am I desperate enough

12:59.430 --> 13:01.171
to have frozen yogurt
with a magician?

13:02.303 --> 13:03.826
I don't care.

13:03.870 --> 13:06.568
Hi, Mr. Mysterio, it's a go.

13:10.659 --> 13:14.228
Three months? I thought I was
only two months behind.

13:14.271 --> 13:15.795
Sorry to bring it up,

13:15.838 --> 13:19.581
it's just the new owner
is kind of cracking down.

13:19.624 --> 13:22.976
So... where do you
hide the cash?

13:23.019 --> 13:25.935
Cereal box?
Cookie jar?

13:25.979 --> 13:28.198
Stuffed inside
a frozen chicken?

13:28.242 --> 13:31.680
Thieves never look
inside a chicken.

13:31.723 --> 13:32.986
You know what,
I'm out of checks.

13:33.029 --> 13:34.596
How 'bout I get it to you
later this week?

13:34.639 --> 13:36.380
I kind of need it now.

13:36.424 --> 13:37.773
I could drive you
to the bank.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.254
I don't have it, Bonnie.

13:40.297 --> 13:42.430
You mean like on the level
you don't have it?

13:42.473 --> 13:45.781
I don't know if you're looking
at me, but I'm shaking my head.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.261
You've lived here
for a hundred years,

13:47.304 --> 13:48.523
you're never late with the rent.

13:48.566 --> 13:51.047
Hang on, you just put
two of the big ones

13:51.091 --> 13:52.875
in the Thursday slot.
Is that right?

13:52.919 --> 13:55.443
It is if I want to
sleep till Sunday.

13:55.486 --> 13:58.620
Let me do this.
Yeah.

13:58.663 --> 14:01.318
One in each?Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, thanks.

14:01.362 --> 14:04.452
I'm not, uh, concentrating
too good right now.

14:04.495 --> 14:05.888
So what's going on?

14:05.932 --> 14:08.543
Well, a couple of months ago,
I got diagnosed with, uh,

14:08.586 --> 14:10.545
prostate cancer.

14:10.588 --> 14:11.851
They found it early,

14:11.894 --> 14:13.722
but they put me on
a couple of medications

14:13.765 --> 14:15.376
the VA doesn't cover, so...

14:15.419 --> 14:16.986
You can't pay your rent.

14:17.030 --> 14:19.597
Oh, I could pay it, but then
I'd have a whole lot of cancer.

14:21.686 --> 14:23.297
Sorry.

14:23.340 --> 14:28.215
These ones are... Monday,
Wednesday, and-and Friday.

14:28.258 --> 14:31.000
There's got to be something
you can do.

14:31.044 --> 14:35.135
Well, I've been trying
to avoid the building manager,

14:35.178 --> 14:37.659
but here you are.

14:42.490 --> 14:44.013
Son of a bitch.

14:44.057 --> 14:45.449
We just took a break.It's been two minutes.

14:45.493 --> 14:48.322
Not you. Munson.Who's Munson?

14:48.365 --> 14:50.237
Blind guy who lives upstairs.

14:50.280 --> 14:51.760
Oh, I like him.

14:51.803 --> 14:53.936
One day we were hanging out
in front of the building,

14:53.980 --> 14:56.721
we made five bucks
for doing nothing.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.291
You guys should go out there
till he makes his rent

15:01.335 --> 15:02.945
'cause he's three months behind.

15:02.989 --> 15:04.512
And he won't pay?

15:04.555 --> 15:06.601
He can't. I'm not evicting
a blind veteran who has cancer.

15:06.644 --> 15:07.950
I'm not doing it.

15:07.994 --> 15:09.386
He's got cancer?

15:09.430 --> 15:11.345
Prostate. And you're getting
a full physical, mister,

15:11.388 --> 15:12.389
including the finger thing.

15:14.348 --> 15:16.306
And don't pinch up,
they got to really look around.

15:20.180 --> 15:23.966
Anyway, Munson can't afford
his meds and rent.

15:24.010 --> 15:25.968
He's got no family,
no support system.

15:26.012 --> 15:27.317
What are you gonna do?

15:27.361 --> 15:29.406
I'm gonna try to talk
some sense into Rita.

15:29.450 --> 15:32.322
Calmly and rationally? Please?

15:32.366 --> 15:34.324
Look, I made peace
with the fact that eating crap

15:34.368 --> 15:36.848
is part of my job, but this
is where I draw the line.

15:36.892 --> 15:39.416
Yeah, that's right,
I draw a line sometimes.

15:43.203 --> 15:46.771
See, now, that didn't sound
calm and rational.

15:46.815 --> 15:49.383
That sounded hot
and "we get kicked out-y."

15:49.426 --> 15:51.994
You're right, you're right.

15:52.038 --> 15:54.605
It just burns me up that-that
rich people like Rita

15:54.649 --> 15:57.130
run everything and people
like us and Munson get screwed.

15:58.435 --> 16:01.438
I did stunts on a movie
like this one time.

16:02.265 --> 16:06.008
It was called Ski Academy.

16:06.052 --> 16:10.099
The rich kids wouldn't let the
poor kids be on the ski patrol.

16:10.143 --> 16:12.449
The poor kids turned off
the power to the lift,

16:12.493 --> 16:14.886
so the rich kids got stuck.

16:22.285 --> 16:26.420
Anyway, I got it on VHS
if anybody wants to see it.

16:29.292 --> 16:30.990
Here we are.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.861
I've got two kinds
of cookies, some cheese,

16:32.904 --> 16:34.428
and a rogue chicken nugget.

16:35.342 --> 16:37.257
Can I get you anything else
or are you good?

16:37.300 --> 16:39.389
I'm swaddled in luxury.

16:39.433 --> 16:42.044
Now why am I here?

16:42.088 --> 16:43.698
Here's the thing.
[clears throat]

16:43.741 --> 16:47.006
One of the tenants you asked me
to evict is Mr. Munson in 2G.

16:47.049 --> 16:49.878
He's a blind Vietnam vet who's
now facing a health crisis.

16:49.921 --> 16:51.358
And while you're
the boss,

16:51.401 --> 16:52.968
and I'm on board
with that,

16:53.012 --> 16:56.885
I got to respectfully say...
can we talk about this a second?

16:56.928 --> 17:00.106
No. I can't afford to know
these people as people.

17:00.149 --> 17:01.368
I'm running a business here.

17:01.411 --> 17:03.022
But they arepeople.

17:03.065 --> 17:06.286
If I make an exception for every
sad story, where does it end?

17:07.504 --> 17:08.940
Have you looked
at this building?

17:08.984 --> 17:11.030
If you live here,
you have a sad story.

17:12.379 --> 17:13.467
And now I rely
on this building

17:13.510 --> 17:16.252
to survive.
That's my sad story.

17:16.296 --> 17:20.735
We are this close to having
a working fountain.

17:21.692 --> 17:23.520
I'm done talking.

17:23.564 --> 17:26.175
Evict him, or I'll
find somebody who will.

17:26.219 --> 17:27.394
Well, then...

17:28.395 --> 17:30.527
I quit.

17:32.225 --> 17:34.705
I may hate my job,
but I don't have to hate myself.

17:34.749 --> 17:37.447
And by the way,
whatever part of you

17:37.491 --> 17:39.928
that's comfortable throwing
a blind man out on the street

17:39.971 --> 17:42.409
is maybe the part your husband
ran screaming from.

17:44.150 --> 17:47.022
I'm sorry, I know this screws
us, but I just couldn't do it.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.155
No, no, no,
don't be sorry.

17:49.198 --> 17:53.072
I'm so glad you didn't let her
turn you into a horrible person.

17:53.115 --> 17:55.770
Well, back into one.

17:57.293 --> 17:59.817
And maybe we end up crashing
at Adam's for a while.

17:59.861 --> 18:01.123
Totally.

18:01.167 --> 18:03.343
Sure.

18:03.386 --> 18:05.171
I'm not heartless.

18:06.433 --> 18:08.870
I just don't know
what the hell I'm doing.

18:08.913 --> 18:11.394
I'm alone, I'm scared.

18:11.438 --> 18:14.180
I haven't worked in 32 years,

18:14.223 --> 18:15.833
and now I got to
run this crapbox.

18:17.444 --> 18:20.403
I mean, is this who I am now?

18:20.447 --> 18:23.624
No, no, it's not who you are.

18:23.667 --> 18:27.106
It's just what you're doing on
the road to who you're gonna be.

18:27.149 --> 18:29.238
What?

18:29.282 --> 18:33.808
Okay, your husband left you, but
that's not Mr. Munson's fault.

18:33.851 --> 18:35.288
Just like it's not your fault

18:35.331 --> 18:37.420
that I'm not doing
what I want to do.

18:38.813 --> 18:41.511
It made sense in the bathroom.

18:41.555 --> 18:45.646
Look, two strong,
smart women like us

18:45.689 --> 18:48.431
can put our heads together and
come up with a reasonable plan

18:48.475 --> 18:50.259
where you get the rent
you so richly deserve

18:50.303 --> 18:52.087
and he gets to keep
his apartment.

18:52.131 --> 18:55.046
I'd be open to that.

18:55.090 --> 18:56.396
Thank you.

18:56.439 --> 18:57.962
I'm not a monster.

18:58.006 --> 18:59.834
Though there is a kid
on the third floor

18:59.877 --> 19:01.357
with a bunny
that needs to go.

19:01.401 --> 19:02.402
You got it,
the kid's out of here.

19:02.445 --> 19:05.361
I meant the bunny.Better.

19:05.405 --> 19:08.756
This is working out
a lot like Ski Academy.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.679
The discount card
we found in the mail

19:18.722 --> 19:20.463
actually did work for
your prescription.
Mm.

19:20.507 --> 19:24.815
The GoFundMe page is...
hanging in there.

19:24.859 --> 19:27.296
It might've helped if you hadn't
paraded around the building

19:27.340 --> 19:29.298
wearing a
"No Fat Chicks" T-shirt.

19:29.342 --> 19:33.824
Well, how the hell am I supposed
to know what my T-shirts say?

19:33.868 --> 19:37.959
And for the record, I do like
a little meat on the bones.

19:38.002 --> 19:41.223
Well, I'll try
and get the word out.

19:41.267 --> 19:44.139
I'll also help you run errands
so you don't have to take a cab.Mm.

19:44.183 --> 19:47.838
And Rita is willing to let you
pay off the back rent over time.

19:47.882 --> 19:51.190
Mm. So this Rita...

19:51.233 --> 19:52.974
is she a good-looking woman?

19:53.017 --> 19:56.804
Yeah, she's very...What the hell?!

19:56.847 --> 19:58.893
You didn't tell me
the little one was here!

19:58.936 --> 20:00.242
