WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
joining us on The

00:00.000 --> 00:00.025
joining us on The Project.

00:00.025 --> 00:00.065
joining us on The Project.
That's

00:06.480 --> 00:09.480
OSHER:
Previously on The Bachelorette...

00:09.480 --> 00:11.720
You're coming up on five minutes!

00:11.720 --> 00:14.840
..Brooke and Jamie-Lee
reached new heights...

00:14.840 --> 00:16.440
Whoo!
Yeah, we did!

00:16.440 --> 00:18.560
Thank you.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.800
I really give Jamie-Lee credit

00:20.800 --> 00:23.840
for being
so honest and vulnerable with me.

00:23.840 --> 00:25.040
..before...

00:25.040 --> 00:28.720
Steve is a human lie detector.

00:28.720 --> 00:32.320
There is a level of deceit
that's taking place.

00:32.320 --> 00:34.640
..Brooke's fears were confirmed.
(TRILLS LIPS)

00:34.640 --> 00:36.080
BROOKE:
Hearing it involves Jamie-Lee,

00:36.080 --> 00:39.600
one of my strongest connections,
hits hard.

00:39.600 --> 00:42.560
There is absolutely nothing there.

00:42.560 --> 00:45.680
Why wouldn't you tell me about this?
Because there's nothing there!

00:45.680 --> 00:50.320
I don't know what that means
for our relationship moving forward.

00:50.320 --> 00:53.360
It sucks now
that I have this on my name!

00:53.360 --> 00:54.880
Tonight...

00:54.880 --> 00:56.960
Five, six, seven, eight!

00:56.960 --> 00:58.600
..a colourful carnival
of inclusion...

00:58.600 --> 01:02.000
Kiki's here! Kiki's ready to party!

01:02.000 --> 01:04.240
..brings everyone together.

01:04.240 --> 01:07.280
HOLLY: Love is love,
and having straight men as allies,

01:07.280 --> 01:09.520
to know that you've got
people from outside the community

01:09.520 --> 01:12.880
supporting you,
it doesn't get any better than this.

01:12.880 --> 01:15.600
But the afterparty...

01:15.600 --> 01:19.840
I haven't spoken to Brooke about the
whole situation with Ryan at all.

01:19.840 --> 01:23.200
..sees Jamie-Lee
battling to clear her name.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.240
I know there was
questions that you had

01:25.240 --> 01:28.640
revolving around
my friendship with Ryan.

01:28.640 --> 01:31.120
I think this is gonna be
a really interesting chat.

01:31.120 --> 01:33.360
What is the chapter
of me and Jamie-Lee?

01:42.640 --> 01:45.160
LUCA: It's a new day in the mansion.

01:45.160 --> 01:47.520
I'm really hoping
that all the Jamie-Lee/Ryan stuff

01:47.520 --> 01:49.000
has just been put to bed

01:49.000 --> 01:52.360
and we can just have a brand-new week
in the mansion with no drama.

01:52.360 --> 01:54.680
Oh!
Hey, guys!

01:54.680 --> 01:57.080
We've found something!

01:57.080 --> 01:59.600
Guys!
What is this?

01:59.600 --> 02:00.600
Date card!

02:00.600 --> 02:02.200
LUCA: Whoo!
Whoo!

02:02.200 --> 02:06.080
It's not your usual date card.
It's come with a little surprise.

02:06.080 --> 02:07.960
What's in the box? (LAUGHS)

02:07.960 --> 02:10.200
I like surprises. I like gifts.

02:10.200 --> 02:13.760
So I'm really hoping
that the box has a gift for me

02:13.760 --> 02:16.800
and it's gonna be a single date
with my name on it.

02:16.800 --> 02:18.040
Yesterday was a big day.

02:18.040 --> 02:22.560
Um, who really feels like they
would need this time with Brooke?

02:25.120 --> 02:26.200
I know I do.

02:26.200 --> 02:27.560
I haven't had a single date yet.

02:27.560 --> 02:28.800
Um, we'll see.

02:28.800 --> 02:32.440
I'm...I'm really hopeful
that I get the single date.

02:32.440 --> 02:36.760
So it could actually be someone
that's already had a single date.

02:36.760 --> 02:39.080
Um...I hate to be selfish,

02:39.080 --> 02:41.840
but after the last cocktail party,

02:41.840 --> 02:43.800
I really hope that it's me.

02:43.800 --> 02:47.360
The last cocktail party
was stressful.

02:47.360 --> 02:50.080
Kurt mentioned
this rumour going around.

02:50.080 --> 02:52.200
He said there was
something between Ryan and I.

02:52.200 --> 02:57.480
You know, I just said that there
may have been some body language

02:57.480 --> 02:59.760
to suggest that Ryan...

02:59.760 --> 03:01.960
..was into you.

03:04.360 --> 03:06.880
I'm...I'm honestly really worried.

03:06.880 --> 03:09.080
I feel like...

03:09.080 --> 03:11.720
..after all of this,
Brooke will have a lot of doubt

03:11.720 --> 03:13.880
about my...my character,
and that sucks,

03:13.880 --> 03:17.160
so it's so important
that I clear the air

03:17.160 --> 03:20.720
and it's so important that
Brooke knows that I'm here for her.

03:22.640 --> 03:25.760
LUCA: Millie!
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:25.760 --> 03:27.080
(LAUGHS) Thanks!

03:27.080 --> 03:28.800
Oh, I'm so excited!

03:28.800 --> 03:32.160
I've been really hoping
that I get a single date.

03:32.160 --> 03:34.000
I'm feeling really intrigued
by Brooke.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
There's definitely something there.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.640
I'm really excited to just have
that one-on-one time with her,

03:38.640 --> 03:41.520
away from everyone,
away from all the eyes,

03:41.520 --> 03:44.360
um, and I'm keen, ready to go.

03:49.200 --> 03:52.000
BROOKE:
Millie did come into this very late,

03:52.000 --> 03:55.720
but she really impressed me
on her arrivals night.

03:55.720 --> 03:58.040
What brings you here?

03:58.040 --> 04:00.080
So I'm just really looking for

04:00.080 --> 04:02.480
that person
who is gonna be next to me

04:02.480 --> 04:04.200
that I can come home to
at the end of the day.

04:04.200 --> 04:06.360
Oh!
Yeah.
I love this.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.960
Since then,
every time I've spoken to her,

04:10.960 --> 04:13.120
I've loved our interactions.

04:14.200 --> 04:16.000
I feel like...

04:16.000 --> 04:19.400
..I don't really
question her intentions at all.

04:19.400 --> 04:23.120
And that's so reassuring, because I'm
still feeling a little bit unsettled

04:23.120 --> 04:26.160
after the last cocktail party.

04:26.160 --> 04:27.920
It was a lot of drama,

04:27.920 --> 04:31.560
and I'm looking
for someone authentic and real,

04:31.560 --> 04:34.120
and I really feel that with Millie,

04:34.120 --> 04:36.880
and I really
want to get to know her more.

04:36.880 --> 04:39.520
Holy moly!

04:40.840 --> 04:44.760
Wow! OK. It's a bit fancy.
(LAUGHS) Hello.

04:44.760 --> 04:48.800
Good. How are you? How are you?
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.320
You look great.
Thank you.

04:50.320 --> 04:52.160
So do you.
You're all warmed up.

04:52.160 --> 04:53.840
Yeah, I know.
It's such a sunny day, though.

04:53.840 --> 04:55.320
Like...
(LAUGHS)

04:55.320 --> 04:57.480
Yeah.
I have a big surprise.

04:57.480 --> 04:58.920
So should we go?
Absolutely.

04:58.920 --> 05:00.880
Yeah? Are you ready?
Yeah. Yeah.

05:00.880 --> 05:04.040
Today is about dreams coming true.

05:04.040 --> 05:07.240
So, this is something
that I've always wanted to do.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.920
I'm trying to keep it
a secret from Millie because I...

05:09.920 --> 05:13.880
..I do want to kind of keep that
a bit of a surprise.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.200
I've picked Millie specifically

05:15.200 --> 05:18.040
because I know
she'll be lifting the mood.

05:18.040 --> 05:19.360
I know she'll be excited.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.640
I know that we're gonna
have a lot of fun with it.

05:21.640 --> 05:22.720
(LAUGHS)
OK.

05:22.720 --> 05:24.880
Alright. Ugh!

05:27.000 --> 05:29.440
Thank you.
Have you got...gloves?

05:29.440 --> 05:31.280
Yep.
Beanie?
Yep.

05:31.280 --> 05:32.280
Scarf?

05:32.280 --> 05:33.440
Yep.
Alright.

05:33.440 --> 05:35.120
Ready?
Let's do it.
Go.

05:35.120 --> 05:37.520
Oh, my goodness.

05:37.520 --> 05:40.440
Oh, my goodness!
(LAUGHS)

05:40.440 --> 05:43.160
Oh, wow.
(LAUGHS) What are your thoughts?

05:43.160 --> 05:44.440
(LAUGHS)

05:54.360 --> 05:58.440
I've brought you to our very own
little winter wonderland.

05:58.440 --> 06:00.920
Oh, my goodness!
(LAUGHS) What do you think?

06:00.920 --> 06:02.320
It's so beautiful!

06:02.320 --> 06:05.320
One of my dreams
has always been to see snow,

06:05.320 --> 06:07.600
and I've always wanted to do it
with a partner.

06:07.600 --> 06:08.600
Oh!

06:08.600 --> 06:12.040
So...this is, like, yeah,
pretty big for me.

06:12.040 --> 06:14.880
I grew up
in a very tropical place, so...

06:14.880 --> 06:18.040
..this is my, like,
little dream come true,

06:18.040 --> 06:19.720
and I feel like this is, like,

06:19.720 --> 06:24.200
the most perfect environment
to get to know Millie.

06:24.200 --> 06:27.080
It just feels
really natural, beautiful,

06:27.080 --> 06:30.920
and it's overall
just, like, really bloody romantic.

06:30.920 --> 06:34.640
Are you excited? I'm like a little
kid in a candy store at the moment.

06:34.640 --> 06:36.480
Yeah. I'm so excited.
This is so cool.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.880
Actually...I feel like
I actually want to experience

06:38.880 --> 06:39.880
making a snow angel.

06:39.880 --> 06:41.560
A snow angel? OK.
Come on. You got it.

06:41.560 --> 06:43.800
(LAUGHS)
Alright. You ready?

06:43.800 --> 06:45.320
(BOTH LAUGH)
Lie down.

06:45.320 --> 06:46.640
Oh, my God, it's so cold!

06:46.640 --> 06:48.440
Lie down. You got it.

06:48.440 --> 06:50.560
Hands out, legs out.
(LAUGHS)

06:50.560 --> 06:53.560
Keep going. You gotta go all
the way...no, go all the way down.

06:53.560 --> 06:54.640
And then...

06:56.000 --> 06:58.200
Is mine good?

06:58.200 --> 06:59.280
Yeah.
Ugh!

06:59.280 --> 07:00.600
Hey, yeah.

07:00.600 --> 07:01.680
Aw!

07:01.680 --> 07:05.360
Brooke's so adorable. She
has always wanted to go to the snow.

07:05.360 --> 07:08.640
So I feel really special
that she's brought me.

07:08.640 --> 07:12.000
I have been to the snow before,
so I am coming in,

07:12.000 --> 07:13.600
like, confident that I can,
you know,

07:13.600 --> 07:16.960
navigate her around the snow.
(LAUGHS)

07:16.960 --> 07:19.040
Do you want to
try and build a snowman?

07:21.120 --> 07:25.400
Please show me how this is done.
OK, so...come here.

07:25.400 --> 07:26.960
Just, like, push snow up.

07:29.880 --> 07:31.520
Oh, this is so cool.

07:31.520 --> 07:34.240
How...how much more?

07:34.240 --> 07:36.800
I want him to be, like, really big.
Really big?

07:36.800 --> 07:38.280
OK.
I don't know.

07:38.280 --> 07:39.760
Am I being too ambitious?

07:39.760 --> 07:40.880
Hell, no.

07:40.880 --> 07:43.200
Oh!
(LAUGHS)

07:43.200 --> 07:44.440
Oh! (LAUGHS)
Oh, no!

07:44.440 --> 07:48.160
I'm having
an absolute ball with Millie.

07:48.160 --> 07:49.240
(LAUGHS)

07:49.240 --> 07:52.600
I reckon I can put my jacket on this
and make him look like a total pimp.

07:52.600 --> 07:53.800
OK.

07:53.800 --> 07:55.080
OK, you ready?

07:55.080 --> 07:57.400
(BOTH LAUGH)

07:57.400 --> 08:00.560
It does feel, like, extremely magical
in this, like, environment.

08:03.160 --> 08:05.600
Millie. You make me real happy.

08:05.600 --> 08:07.880
Oh! Can I give you a hug?
Yeah. Come here.
Yeah.

08:07.880 --> 08:10.120
Oh.
Mmm!

08:12.800 --> 08:14.520
To make it spesh.

08:14.520 --> 08:18.640
But when I picture this
beautiful setting, I feel like...

08:18.640 --> 08:20.120
..in my head, in the movies,

08:20.120 --> 08:23.520
it always has,
like, a beautiful backdrop.

08:25.160 --> 08:27.720
What was your, like,
first impression?

08:27.720 --> 08:31.040
Of you? Fun.
Oh, OK.

08:31.040 --> 08:33.680
Which is...you're living up to my...

08:33.680 --> 08:35.760
I'll...I'll take that.
..pre-idea.

08:35.760 --> 08:37.400
Fun. OK.
Fun. Yeah.

08:37.400 --> 08:40.760
You came in and you were, like,
with your little sparkly jumpsuit.

08:40.760 --> 08:42.240
(LAUGHS) Yeah.

08:42.240 --> 08:45.280
As much as
I like to have fun, like...

08:45.280 --> 08:48.440
..I also love,
like, a, you know, 3am...

08:48.440 --> 08:49.680
..D & M.

08:49.680 --> 08:51.440
You have pillow talk?

08:51.440 --> 08:54.360
Yeah, pillow talk. (LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS) I love that.

08:54.360 --> 08:57.560
I'm, like,
loving getting to know Millie.

08:57.560 --> 09:01.200
She's fun. She's energetic.
Like, she's very self-aware.

09:01.200 --> 09:05.320
She's got a lot of traits
that I, like, love about her.

09:05.320 --> 09:08.400
I don't think I could have done this
with anyone else.

09:08.400 --> 09:10.240
I love it.
Yeah?

09:10.240 --> 09:12.280
Beautiful. Beautiful backdrop.

09:12.280 --> 09:13.880
Yeah.
For a beautiful girl.

09:13.880 --> 09:15.600
It's perfect. Well done.
Good job.

09:28.680 --> 09:30.040
Yeah.
(LAUGHS)

09:30.040 --> 09:31.840
This is what I prepared earlier.
Wow, it's beautiful.

09:33.320 --> 09:36.400
So...I've got a little bit...

09:36.400 --> 09:37.680
..of a little...

09:37.680 --> 09:39.640
Yeah.
..movie planned.

09:39.640 --> 09:41.040
Oh, OK.

09:41.040 --> 09:42.640
I think to end this perfect day,

09:42.640 --> 09:45.120
I want to show Millie
a more intimate side.

09:45.120 --> 09:47.880
I love snuggling up with my partner.

09:47.880 --> 09:51.000
You connect, you sit back, relax,

09:51.000 --> 09:54.040
and just enjoy
each other's company, really.

09:54.040 --> 09:55.280
Little bit...

09:55.280 --> 09:56.920
..snuggly and cosy.

09:56.920 --> 09:58.320
Yeah, what is it?

09:58.320 --> 10:00.960
This is one of
my favourite movies, yep.

10:04.040 --> 10:06.160
It's Grease.
Oh! (LAUGHS)

10:06.160 --> 10:07.480
How did you guess?
It's Grease.

10:07.480 --> 10:09.760
'Cause I've seen this movie
so many times.

10:09.760 --> 10:13.480
It's one of my bloody favourites.
Is it? Oh, I'm so glad.

10:13.480 --> 10:15.400
Do you know all the songs?

10:15.400 --> 10:18.480
I will try
to remember all the lyrics, but...

10:18.480 --> 10:20.360
I just like the romance in it
and, like, the love story.

10:20.360 --> 10:22.640
Oh. Yeah.
Yeah, it's really cute.

10:22.640 --> 10:25.600
Sitting with Brooke
right now on the couch...

10:25.600 --> 10:27.080
(LAUGHS)

10:27.080 --> 10:29.000
..I'm...I'm feeling really happy.

10:30.520 --> 10:34.120
I just feel, like, so privileged to,
like, get to see that side of her.

10:34.120 --> 10:37.640
It's what I've been waiting for,
and it was, yeah, really special.

10:38.720 --> 10:42.800
I love how they fly off
into the distance. It's so...

10:42.800 --> 10:44.240
Bye!

10:44.240 --> 10:47.200
Yay!

10:47.200 --> 10:49.760
I have never been
romanced like this before.

10:49.760 --> 10:53.840
Like, to come into, like, the winter
wonderland - you know, her dream...

10:53.840 --> 10:55.920
(LAUGHS) ..um...yeah.

10:55.920 --> 10:57.320
It was perfect.

10:57.320 --> 10:59.440
I actually don't think I've...

10:59.440 --> 11:01.280
..I can't remember
the last time, like,

11:01.280 --> 11:04.720
I've had that much fun
with, like, another person.

11:04.720 --> 11:08.480
And...yeah, like,
I feel really grateful that you...

11:08.480 --> 11:11.680
..kind of let me into that,
like, part of you as well.

11:11.680 --> 11:12.920
So...
Oh.

11:12.920 --> 11:14.760
..really happy
to be a part of that and...

11:14.760 --> 11:16.760
Yeah.
Yeah.

11:16.760 --> 11:18.440
I'll remember this
for the rest of my life.

11:18.440 --> 11:20.040
Aw!
So...yeah.

11:20.040 --> 11:21.640
Yeah, so will I.

11:22.680 --> 11:25.360
You seem so self-assured,

11:25.360 --> 11:27.640
like, very confident
in your own self.

11:27.640 --> 11:30.960
It's a very rare trait
that people have,

11:30.960 --> 11:32.960
which I really like about you.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.440
Thanks.
It's a really attractive trait.

11:34.440 --> 11:35.600
Mmm.

11:35.600 --> 11:38.600
Like, the woman that I picture myself
being with is, like, super-confident.

11:38.600 --> 11:39.600
Like...

11:39.600 --> 11:41.160
Yeah.
..holds herself.

11:41.160 --> 11:44.200
But if I need her, will have my back.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.000
That's...yeah.
Yeah. That's...

11:46.000 --> 11:47.800
Which I can see in you.
Yeah.

11:47.800 --> 11:50.280
Like, if...if I'm partnered
to someone else, like, that's...

11:50.280 --> 11:53.880
Mmm.
..I want to feel supported by them.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.640
So...

11:55.640 --> 11:58.120
..I will...I'll do the same.

12:00.760 --> 12:02.040
You know...

12:02.040 --> 12:03.960
..I want...

12:03.960 --> 12:06.320
..something really serious.

12:06.320 --> 12:07.360
And you've...
Mmm.

12:07.360 --> 12:10.200
..made yourself really clear
about how seriously you take this.

12:10.200 --> 12:11.720
Mmm.

12:11.720 --> 12:16.000
It's attractive, obviously, and I...
but I just respect it so much.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.480
And that's what I want.

12:17.480 --> 12:20.440
And I don't want you to, you know,
feel like you're choosing anyone

12:20.440 --> 12:22.280
who's not gonna meet you...

12:22.280 --> 12:23.840
..not meet...
not even meet you halfway,

12:23.840 --> 12:25.600
like, meet you where you are.

12:26.600 --> 12:28.800
I think
what I uncovered about Millie

12:28.800 --> 12:30.120
is that she's an open book.

12:30.120 --> 12:32.560
Like, what you see is what you get.

12:32.560 --> 12:34.640
She does have, like,
this very contagious energy.

12:34.640 --> 12:37.040
Like, she brings out
the fun side of me,

12:37.040 --> 12:39.840
but she is also grounded
in the same way.

12:41.120 --> 12:42.800
I do have something.
Mmm.

12:42.800 --> 12:44.480
(CLEARS THROAT)

12:45.960 --> 12:48.520
Mmm. Yes, it's really pretty.
(GASPS)

12:48.520 --> 12:50.760
Oh!

12:50.760 --> 12:53.280
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)

12:53.280 --> 12:55.280
I...I...honestly,
I had so much fun today.

12:55.280 --> 12:57.720
Like, I've not stopped laughing.
(LAUGHS)

12:58.920 --> 13:01.640
So I was hoping, Millie...

13:01.640 --> 13:04.200
Yes.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.720
..will you accept this rose?

13:05.720 --> 13:08.080
100%. I will.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.200
Oh.

13:09.200 --> 13:10.760
Beautiful.

13:10.760 --> 13:12.240
Yeah.
Come here.

13:21.400 --> 13:24.640
I'm...really hoping that it
just keeps going up and up and up.

13:24.640 --> 13:26.680
Like, I just want
to keep spending time with her.

13:26.680 --> 13:28.600
And hopefully, like, our connection

13:28.600 --> 13:31.080
just keeps building
and make more memories.

13:34.840 --> 13:38.080
I came in here to build
strong connections with people,

13:38.080 --> 13:42.400
and Millie has just come in strong
and she's so reassuring.

13:42.400 --> 13:45.400
I do really picture something
with Millie.

13:45.400 --> 13:48.640
And I feel really positive
about what we could have.

14:02.560 --> 14:04.360
Oh, this is go...
this is gonna be a photoshoot.

14:04.360 --> 14:05.840
What is this?
What the hell is this?

14:05.840 --> 14:07.440
(LAUGHTER)

14:07.440 --> 14:09.360
We're all here. We're at the SCG.

14:09.360 --> 14:12.080
There's high heels, a unicorn.

14:12.080 --> 14:15.160
(LAUGHTER AND CHEERING)

14:15.160 --> 14:17.680
Where is she?
Oh, my God! It looks so good!

14:17.680 --> 14:19.320
(SQUEALING)

14:19.320 --> 14:21.800
DARVID: Definitely gonna be
Mardi Gras themes.

14:21.800 --> 14:23.160
Is that Mardi Gras?
(LAUGHTER)

14:23.160 --> 14:24.640
It's on the massive screen.

14:24.640 --> 14:27.600
We've got the love hearts
all around the outside.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.280
I'm really excited.

14:30.280 --> 14:33.840
Morning, ladies! Morning, gentlemen!
CONTESTANTS: Morning!

14:33.840 --> 14:36.000
Welcome to the Sydney Cricket Ground!

14:36.000 --> 14:37.800
(CHEERING)
Looking good.

14:37.800 --> 14:43.240
This is the home
of the Mardi Gras Parade in 2021.

14:43.240 --> 14:45.800
In 1978, just down the road,
in Oxford Street,

14:45.800 --> 14:48.680
the very first march occurred.

14:48.680 --> 14:55.080
It was a protest for
the rights of the LGBTQI+ community.

14:55.080 --> 15:00.800
Now, while today, the parade is
a huge celebration of queer culture,

15:00.800 --> 15:06.560
it hasn't forgotten its roots as a
powerful movement for social change.

15:06.560 --> 15:10.320
Brooke, you've marched in Mardi Gras,
haven't you? What's it like?

15:11.400 --> 15:15.000
It is a celebration
about love, inclusivity.

15:15.000 --> 15:19.200
'Pride' is probably the only word
that I have to explain how I feel.

15:19.200 --> 15:22.480
I'm so excited for today's date.

15:22.480 --> 15:24.800
It's really important for me...

15:24.800 --> 15:29.320
..finding a partner
that supports Mardi Gras,

15:29.320 --> 15:31.600
like, if...
even if they're, like, a guy

15:31.600 --> 15:33.960
and we're in
a heterosexual relationship,

15:33.960 --> 15:38.760
that they still support me being
a part of the LGBTQI+ community,

15:38.760 --> 15:42.120
which is a big deal -
it means a lot to me.

15:42.120 --> 15:44.800
Everyone,
I would like you to meet Teresa...

15:46.440 --> 15:49.680
..who has marched for 17 years in...

15:49.680 --> 15:51.240
(CHEERING)

15:51.240 --> 15:53.160
What makes a good float?

15:53.160 --> 15:56.040
Mardi Gras's about extremes.
Over-the-top.

15:56.040 --> 16:00.040
You know that saying, "When you walk
out the door, take something off"?

16:00.040 --> 16:03.280
At Mardi Gras, as you
walk out the door, you got to add.

16:03.280 --> 16:05.920
(LAUGHS)
I hope you're listening.

16:05.920 --> 16:08.760
Because that is what today
is all about.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.760
You are gonna be creating a float

16:10.760 --> 16:13.040
and having your own
mini Mardi Gras Parade!

16:13.040 --> 16:15.720
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

16:17.360 --> 16:19.160
Yeah.

16:19.160 --> 16:25.840
In two teams, you will create
banners, costumes, choreography,

16:25.840 --> 16:27.240
decorating your float

16:27.240 --> 16:31.360
with these incredible set pieces
from Sydney Props.

16:31.360 --> 16:33.880
You're gonna need a team leader.

16:33.880 --> 16:38.120
And you'll also need
to create a role for Brooke,

16:38.120 --> 16:40.280
who will march with each team.

16:40.280 --> 16:41.960
I really just want to see everyone

16:41.960 --> 16:44.720
just get around it and...

16:44.720 --> 16:45.960
..be in their element.

16:45.960 --> 16:48.720
I don't want anyone to hold back.

16:48.720 --> 16:52.640
Like, this is a celebration about
Mardi Gras, so I want it to be fun.

16:52.640 --> 16:55.200
I'm excited for them
and I'm just hoping that, you know,

16:55.200 --> 16:56.880
they bring the energy.

16:56.880 --> 16:58.960
You ready to go?
CONTESTANTS: Yeah!
Alright!

16:58.960 --> 17:02.320
Let's get it going! Let's start!
Let's go.

17:06.280 --> 17:08.280
(LAUGHTER)

17:08.280 --> 17:10.840
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

17:10.840 --> 17:12.760
I am team captain today.

17:12.760 --> 17:15.560
The big rig! Go and get the unicorn!

17:15.560 --> 17:20.360
In my team,
I've got Darvid, Luca, Taje and Kurt,

17:20.360 --> 17:22.040
and we are Team Disco.

17:22.040 --> 17:26.160
Yeah, costumes last. I reckon
we should put these on there first.

17:26.160 --> 17:28.200
I think I do have
a little bit of an advantage.

17:28.200 --> 17:29.400
Holly, what do you reckon?

17:29.400 --> 17:32.080
I think we should put the stereo
in the centre.

17:32.080 --> 17:34.040
So I've been a dancer
since I was about two,

17:34.040 --> 17:36.400
and I am also a cheerleader.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.160
So when we're doing spirit fingers...
Yeah.

17:38.160 --> 17:40.640
So, pretty happy
to take the lead and...

17:40.640 --> 17:42.120
..I'll definitely be able
to give everyone

17:42.120 --> 17:44.200
a little cheerleader spirit today.

17:44.200 --> 17:46.360
Tell us where, Holls.
The zebra on the other side.

17:46.360 --> 17:48.360
And put the star behind the disco.

17:48.360 --> 17:49.880
I feel like a, um...

17:49.880 --> 17:51.720
..I don't know if I'm allowed
to say this word on TV,

17:51.720 --> 17:53.880
but I'm gonna say it anyway -
I feel like a bit of a boss bitch.

17:53.880 --> 17:54.880
Do four big sign...

17:54.880 --> 17:57.520
TAJE: What happened
to getting all the stuff up?

17:57.520 --> 17:59.120
100% wearing that. Yep.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.000
We got distracted.
(LAUGHTER)

18:01.000 --> 18:03.440
I feel like
I'm back in primary school

18:03.440 --> 18:06.280
with Holly being the teacher
for the day.

18:06.280 --> 18:08.440
Oh, man. I've
got the worst knickers on. (LAUGHS)

18:08.440 --> 18:09.880
Luca!

18:09.880 --> 18:11.880
You know, detentions all round
if you stuff up.

18:11.880 --> 18:13.600
Boys, do you want to come help paint?
Yes.

18:13.600 --> 18:18.320
Fingers crossed that my...
(LAUGHS) ..my team pulls it together.

18:18.320 --> 18:20.080
STEVE: Alright, so, look,

18:20.080 --> 18:21.840
it's probably better
we got this one, 'cause it's got

18:21.840 --> 18:23.640
every colour of the rainbow,
so it's all-inclusive.

18:23.640 --> 18:24.880
Hell, yes.
All colours included.

18:24.880 --> 18:26.440
Yes.
Yep. No-one left out.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.640
WILL:
I'm feeling a little bit of pressure

18:28.640 --> 18:30.720
after sticking my hand up
for team captain

18:30.720 --> 18:32.000
of the Rainbow Team.

18:32.000 --> 18:36.200
So, we've got Konrad,
Steven, Millie and Jamie-Lee.

18:36.200 --> 18:39.480
But, yep,
I think my role is gonna be more...

18:39.480 --> 18:40.960
..floating, go where I'm needed.

18:40.960 --> 18:42.720
So, guys, just with our...

18:42.720 --> 18:45.600
..with all our, um, boards
and all our messages,

18:45.600 --> 18:48.040
what does our main message
want to be?

18:48.040 --> 18:49.640
Like...so...
I think 'equality'.

18:49.640 --> 18:51.960
Equality?
Yeah.

18:51.960 --> 18:54.000
Hell, yeah. I was made for this.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.320
This is my favourite day of the year.

18:56.320 --> 18:58.200
Can I do everyone's make-up?
OTHERS: Yeah.

18:58.200 --> 19:00.640
Yeah?
Yes, absolutely.
I love that!

19:01.800 --> 19:06.120
But, look, I came
into this group date super-nervous,

19:06.120 --> 19:09.280
after the whole Ryan debacle,

19:09.280 --> 19:11.240
so I just really want to stand out.

19:11.240 --> 19:13.840
I really want to show Brooke
that I'm here for love.

19:13.840 --> 19:15.920
And what better way to do it than,

19:15.920 --> 19:18.920
you know, with
the Sydney Mardi Gras kind of theme?

19:18.920 --> 19:21.440
Millie, you've got the glue? Yeah?

19:21.440 --> 19:23.360
I think we may need to add
some more colour to that.

19:23.360 --> 19:25.040
Yeah.

19:25.040 --> 19:28.640
So, yeah, having the best float
today, it's very important.

19:28.640 --> 19:30.960
Yep. Love it.

19:32.960 --> 19:35.520
Do you want to wear this one, Darv?

19:35.520 --> 19:37.400
What do you call this?
Like, a boob tube?

19:37.400 --> 19:39.480
You're not getting in that.

19:39.480 --> 19:41.040
Try it on, though.

19:41.040 --> 19:44.600
I'm feeling pretty excited
being in Team Disco.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.520
And we're gelling together
really well as a team.

19:46.520 --> 19:49.200
Some bling?
LUCA: Yes!

19:49.200 --> 19:51.120
Although I think
all the fellas got real distracted

19:51.120 --> 19:53.200
with the tight glittery clothing.

19:53.200 --> 19:55.320
I might go gold. Are you going gold?

19:55.320 --> 19:57.320
But, yeah,

19:57.320 --> 19:58.800
I really want
to catch Brooke's eye today.

19:58.800 --> 20:01.360
Um...you know,
it's a big group of people.

20:01.360 --> 20:03.680
TAJE: Now, costumes, you guys.
HOLLY: Finalise costumes.

20:03.680 --> 20:06.800
So I'm thinking what I've got to do

20:06.800 --> 20:10.200
is get the most outrageous outfit
I can possibly find.

20:10.200 --> 20:11.200
Go this underneath.
Yep.

20:11.200 --> 20:12.520
I don't know how that's gonna work.

20:12.520 --> 20:13.760
But...
Ready? It's stretchy.

20:13.760 --> 20:14.800
Yep.
Oh, yeah.

20:14.800 --> 20:16.160
(LAUGHTER)
That's gonna rip.

20:16.160 --> 20:17.920
That's gonna look really good, Kurt.

20:17.920 --> 20:20.360
I'm not gonna
have a manhood after that.

20:20.360 --> 20:22.800
I'm gonna need to cut a hole
in the middle, I think.

20:22.800 --> 20:26.320
I think...you know, we lucked out
with Holly being our leader.

20:26.320 --> 20:28.240
Alright, final touches.

20:28.240 --> 20:29.400
Holly's got the expertise.

20:29.400 --> 20:31.360
She's done cheerleading stuff
before.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.520
Yep.
She's really good at dance.

20:32.520 --> 20:33.520
Yep.

20:33.520 --> 20:35.080
She's so good at directing people.

20:35.080 --> 20:36.600
And a little skirt.
Perfect!

20:36.600 --> 20:38.040
Yep.
We need to start making a routine.

20:38.040 --> 20:41.040
Kind of just making it
work like clockwork, so...

20:41.040 --> 20:42.320
..yeah, go, Holly.

20:42.320 --> 20:43.520
Alright. Routine.

20:43.520 --> 20:46.200
Um, just for a heads-up,
I can't dance for shit.

20:46.200 --> 20:48.760
Yeah. No, we'll probably d...
it's more a march, isn't it?

20:48.760 --> 20:50.120
Can I manhandle you into positions?

20:50.120 --> 20:51.800
Yes.
OK.

20:51.800 --> 20:53.920
(LAUGHS) Choreography
is a huge part of my life.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.360
You're gonna be there.

20:56.360 --> 20:59.560
So...I want big movements,

20:59.560 --> 21:01.880
movements
that are gonna be easy to remember

21:01.880 --> 21:04.560
and they're gonna look...look good
as we're walking around the field.

21:04.560 --> 21:06.520
BROOKE: What is happening over here?

21:06.520 --> 21:09.080
Have I just got to the choreography?

21:09.080 --> 21:10.800
TAJE: Yes. Perfect timing.

21:10.800 --> 21:12.200
You're gonna be at the front.
(LAUGHS)

21:12.200 --> 21:15.480
And I know that everyone wants
to spend time with Brooke today.

21:15.480 --> 21:17.960
So...I've decided that

21:17.960 --> 21:21.000
everyone's gonna have a chance
to dance with Brooke as we go.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.760
At different stages,
you're gonna make your way

21:22.760 --> 21:24.920
and dance with all of us
and do different things.

21:24.920 --> 21:27.360
Like, Kurt might pick you up
and twirl you. Darvid might...

21:27.360 --> 21:32.360
Holly is so funny. I love seeing her
in her element all the time.

21:32.360 --> 21:35.080
And she's like an absolute dance mum
at the moment.

21:35.080 --> 21:37.760
One...
Two, three, four.

21:37.760 --> 21:41.480
Five, six, seven, eight.
And dance, two, three...

21:41.480 --> 21:43.640
Just not too sure
if, you know, the rest of them

21:43.640 --> 21:46.880
can kind of catch up. (LAUGHS)

21:46.880 --> 21:48.040
Seven, eight.
(LAUGHS)

21:48.040 --> 21:51.640
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

21:51.640 --> 21:56.000
And one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.680
(SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)
(LAUGHS)

21:58.680 --> 22:01.080
JAMIE-LEE: Konrad,
that wig has your name on it.

22:01.080 --> 22:02.080
KONRAD: Yeah.

22:05.120 --> 22:06.880
STEVE: Some weight to that?
(JAMIE-LEE LAUGHS)

22:06.880 --> 22:09.280
Will is our captain,
but it seems like, uh,

22:09.280 --> 22:11.560
Jamie-Lee
is giving most of the directions.

22:11.560 --> 22:14.280
STEVE: (LAUGHS) Yeah!
MILLIE: Uh-huh.

22:14.280 --> 22:18.520
KONRAD: To be fair, she's
throwing out some creative ideas.

22:18.520 --> 22:21.560
Yeah, so Jamie-Lee
has appointed me the role of queen.

22:21.560 --> 22:24.640
And... (LAUGHS)
..look, I'm stoked about that.

22:24.640 --> 22:27.560
I'm gonna be front and centre
with Brooke, who's gonna be my king.

22:27.560 --> 22:30.840
We're gonna be up the front of
the float, you know, leading the way.

22:30.840 --> 22:33.000
I'm Queen Kiki! (LAUGHS)

22:33.000 --> 22:34.200
Yeah, I'm happy about that.

22:34.200 --> 22:36.800
You know, it gives me more time
with just Brooke, I guess, up front.

22:36.800 --> 22:39.040
JAMIE-LEE: Our queen.

22:39.040 --> 22:41.200
How do you feel about this?

22:41.200 --> 22:45.080
Ooh! Yes! Stop! Stop!

22:46.520 --> 22:48.560
I've done
a little bit of drag before.

22:49.760 --> 22:53.040
So I think I'm gonna shine,
as Kiki, baby.

22:53.040 --> 22:54.360
Hell, yeah,
and then I was just gonna go

22:54.360 --> 22:56.360
with a very simple colourful number.

22:56.360 --> 22:57.480
MILLIE: Right.

22:57.480 --> 23:01.040
I am not recognising
that I'm taking control here,

23:01.040 --> 23:03.080
but I'm having so much fun
with this.

23:03.080 --> 23:06.360
Jamie-Lee, I will wear
anything you want to put me in.

23:06.360 --> 23:07.760
Millie, your outfit's over here, OK?

23:07.760 --> 23:09.320
OK.
Hey, Will.

23:09.320 --> 23:11.000
Yeah, yeah?
How do you feel about this?

23:11.000 --> 23:12.960
I feel like
our team is doing really well.

23:12.960 --> 23:14.840
Alright. I think everyone's sorted.

23:14.840 --> 23:18.840
And, you know, yes,
Holly is a professional dancer,

23:18.840 --> 23:22.200
but I have been in Mardi Gras
before, I know how this works.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.000
BOTH: Two, three, four.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.800
I also remember
some of my old routine.

23:25.800 --> 23:27.000
One, two...
(LAUGHS)

23:27.000 --> 23:28.800
So I think
we can really pull this together.

23:28.800 --> 23:31.120
Which way's left?
That way.

23:32.480 --> 23:33.760
OSHER: Coming up...

23:33.760 --> 23:36.040
(CHEERING)

23:36.040 --> 23:38.960
..it's Mardi Gras
Bachelorette-style...

23:38.960 --> 23:41.960
Let's see what you've got!
(CHEERING)

23:41.960 --> 23:45.120
HOLLY:
Brooke is getting twirled and spun.

23:45.120 --> 23:46.120
So stoked.

23:46.120 --> 23:49.280
..before the cocktail party...
Come here.

23:49.280 --> 23:51.080
..fires up...

23:51.080 --> 23:53.440
..as Jamie-Lee...

23:53.440 --> 23:55.360
I really hope
she comes and grabs me.

23:55.360 --> 23:57.600
If not, I am definitely going home.

23:57.600 --> 23:59.920
..confronts the rumours head-on.

23:59.920 --> 24:03.920
I don't want to create drama.
I just want to clear my name.

24:05.160 --> 24:07.320
Alright.
(LAUGHS)

24:20.000 --> 24:24.040
The floats are looking really good.
It is stiff competition already.

24:25.280 --> 24:27.560
Everyone looks amazing.

24:27.560 --> 24:30.240
Push your butt back. Yeah.
(LAUGHS)

24:30.240 --> 24:35.160
Oh! It's gonna be so fun. It's gonna
be hard judging, but I'm so stoked.

24:35.160 --> 24:36.560
I'm...I'm ready.

24:39.160 --> 24:41.120
(CHEERING)

24:41.120 --> 24:43.360
Everybody's welcome to the party!

24:43.360 --> 24:44.880
(CHEERING)

24:45.880 --> 24:47.440
Oh, hello!

24:47.440 --> 24:49.840
(CHEERING AND LAUGHTER)

24:49.840 --> 24:51.480
DARVID: Hello.
What are you keeping under there?

24:51.480 --> 24:54.240
(CHEERING)

24:57.000 --> 25:00.520
I'm, like, really bright. (LAUGHS)
Oh, my gosh!

25:00.520 --> 25:03.640
You look amazing. Amazing. Amazing.

25:03.640 --> 25:05.360
Oh, my gosh!
Wow.

25:05.360 --> 25:06.960
I don't think
she can wear anything bad.

25:06.960 --> 25:09.800
Honestly, she looks unreal.
(LAUGHS)

25:09.800 --> 25:11.480
Wow.

25:11.480 --> 25:13.200
And I'm stoked
to be doing this with her.

25:13.200 --> 25:15.160
Party!

25:15.160 --> 25:18.280
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
(LAUGHS)

25:18.280 --> 25:20.160
Yes!

25:20.160 --> 25:21.760
Rainbow float, are you ready?

25:21.760 --> 25:24.280
TEAM: Yes!
Let's do it.

25:24.280 --> 25:26.560
Let's see what you've got!
MAN: Good luck, guys.

25:26.560 --> 25:27.680
Oh, get in there, buddy.

25:27.680 --> 25:29.600
JAMIE-LEE: Hell, yeah, we got this.

25:29.600 --> 25:31.480
Alright, guys.

25:31.480 --> 25:32.640
Yes, Queen!

25:32.640 --> 25:36.560
Let's do this. Kiki's here!
Kiki's ready to party!

25:36.560 --> 25:38.360
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

25:40.960 --> 25:44.840
Yeah, I feel it's pretty special
to share this with Brooke.

25:44.840 --> 25:47.080
I'm hoping that, uh,
she sees that side of me

25:47.080 --> 25:49.440
that is happy
to leave the ego at the door

25:49.440 --> 25:51.800
and doesn't care about being judged
and is happy to...

25:51.800 --> 25:53.520
..to just get amongst it.

25:53.520 --> 25:56.280
(CHEERING)

25:56.280 --> 25:58.240
You know, I want to...
I want to see people smile

25:58.240 --> 26:01.320
and I want to be loud
and I want to be...proud.

26:01.320 --> 26:02.640
(LAUGHS)

26:04.520 --> 26:06.880
Equality!
(LAUGHTER)

26:06.880 --> 26:08.720
Oh! Has someone fallen over?

26:09.720 --> 26:12.680
Someone's lost a shoe.
Jamie lost a shoe!

26:12.680 --> 26:15.920
Lose a shoe?

26:15.920 --> 26:17.760
Oh, she's back! She's back!

26:17.760 --> 26:20.240
JAMIE-LEE: I've given today my all.

26:20.240 --> 26:23.240
This is a group date
that I'm proud to be a part of.

26:23.240 --> 26:28.360
But also, I wanted Brooke to see
how much I want to be here.

26:28.360 --> 26:30.560
Lose a shoe?
(CHEERING)

26:30.560 --> 26:33.840
So...I feel like...
I'm having the best time.

26:33.840 --> 26:37.560
Even though I stumbled,
I get back up and...

26:37.560 --> 26:38.560
..we're killing it.

26:38.560 --> 26:42.480
(CHEERING AND INDISTINCT CHATTER)

26:42.480 --> 26:47.080
Wow. It felt incredible
marching with the Rainbow Team.

26:47.080 --> 26:49.880
(LAUGHTER AND CHEERING)

26:55.720 --> 26:56.960
We ready?
Yeah!

26:56.960 --> 26:58.280
We're ready.
Alright. Let's do it.

26:58.280 --> 27:00.120
(LAUGHS)
Let's do it.

27:00.120 --> 27:01.640
OK. Alright.
(CHEERING)

27:01.640 --> 27:04.800
Alright! I love love! I love love!

27:04.800 --> 27:06.800
(CHEERING)
I love love!

27:06.800 --> 27:09.120
Disco!
Team Disco!

27:09.120 --> 27:12.120
Welcome to the party!

27:12.120 --> 27:14.320
Five, six, seven, eight!

27:14.320 --> 27:16.120
Hey!

27:16.120 --> 27:17.560
Five, six, seven, eight!

27:17.560 --> 27:19.040
And down!

27:19.040 --> 27:21.760
Yeah, we're disco. Disco up.
Disco down.

27:21.760 --> 27:23.800
Disco up. Discos up.

27:23.800 --> 27:26.440
Disco up. Disco down.
(LAUGHTER)

27:26.440 --> 27:29.040
(CHEERING AND INDISTINCT CHATTER)

27:29.040 --> 27:30.680
(SQUEALS)
Disco down!

27:30.680 --> 27:33.480
Disco up! Disco down! Disco up...

27:33.480 --> 27:36.800
The team is having the best time.

27:36.800 --> 27:37.920
Up!
Swap sides.

27:37.920 --> 27:40.080
One, two, three, four, five...

27:40.080 --> 27:42.120
The boys don't give themselves
enough credit.

27:42.120 --> 27:44.560
They're really keeping up.

27:44.560 --> 27:48.960
Brooke is getting twirled and spun
all the way around.

27:48.960 --> 27:51.480
She's loving it. We're loving it.

27:51.480 --> 27:53.080
And...

27:53.080 --> 27:56.560
..I think one of the things
that stood out for me today...

27:58.360 --> 27:59.880
..is having...

27:59.880 --> 28:02.120
..straight men as allies.

28:02.120 --> 28:06.040
(INAUDIBLE)

28:06.040 --> 28:08.080
That's not always so,

28:08.080 --> 28:11.160
out in the big wide world,

28:11.160 --> 28:12.880
and to know that you've...

28:12.880 --> 28:17.480
..got people from outside
the community supporting you,

28:17.480 --> 28:18.800
it's really wonderful.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.560
Give me an L!
L!

28:22.560 --> 28:24.400
Give me a G!
G!

28:24.400 --> 28:25.720
Give me a B!

28:25.720 --> 28:26.720
B!

28:26.720 --> 28:29.640
And this just goes to show
that love is love

28:29.640 --> 28:33.280
and it's beautiful
and it's wonderful and...

28:34.880 --> 28:37.880
..I just feel very fortunate to
be here and to be a part of it all.

28:37.880 --> 28:41.160
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

28:41.160 --> 28:42.640
It doesn't get any better than this.

28:44.080 --> 28:46.000
(LAUGHTER)

28:49.880 --> 28:51.800
Oh, my God! So good! (LAUGHS)

28:51.800 --> 28:54.840
(LAUGHS) It was so... Oh!

28:54.840 --> 28:57.400
It's been so much fun.

28:57.400 --> 29:00.160
Like, they have done so well.

29:00.160 --> 29:01.760
The messaging is spot-on,

29:01.760 --> 29:07.480
the choreography there, the energy,
the adrenaline - everything.

29:07.480 --> 29:11.120
Today has meant
the absolute world to me.

29:24.280 --> 29:25.760
KONRAD: Mardi Gras afterparty.

29:25.760 --> 29:27.840
Oh!
It's a vibe.

29:27.840 --> 29:28.960
Cheers.

29:28.960 --> 29:30.440
Happy Mardi Gras!
Happy Mardi Gras.

29:30.440 --> 29:31.960
Happy Mardi Gras.
KONRAD: (LAUGHS) I like it.

29:31.960 --> 29:34.840
Everyone's dressed up.
Everyone looks great.

29:34.840 --> 29:37.160
Say hello to Kiki. (LAUGHS)

29:38.440 --> 29:40.520
(CHEERING AND LAUGHTER)

29:40.520 --> 29:42.680
Yeah, I love a...I love a Kiki on.

29:42.680 --> 29:44.800
(LAUGHS)

29:46.160 --> 29:48.560
How good was the group date, bro?

29:48.560 --> 29:50.800
Group date was...
Elite.

29:50.800 --> 29:52.560
Ripper day.
(GLASSES CLINK)
Ripper of a day.

29:52.560 --> 29:55.680
Mardi Gras. Much needed.
Some good vibes amongst the house.

29:56.800 --> 29:59.200
It's definitely
a different vibe tonight

29:59.200 --> 30:01.040
than the past cocktail parties.

30:01.040 --> 30:03.520
Yep.
Um...it's quite nice.

30:05.440 --> 30:09.200
But I...I am personally
a little stressed going into tonight.

30:11.120 --> 30:13.560
After today's group date, I feel like

30:13.560 --> 30:15.920
I wasn't on Brooke's radar at all,
which sucks.

30:17.200 --> 30:20.960
I definitely needed
to get a bit of Brooke's attention.

30:20.960 --> 30:25.440
And, honestly,
I'm feeling really vulnerable.

30:26.680 --> 30:29.360
I feel like
a lot is riding on tonight.

30:31.800 --> 30:33.240
So, yeah, feeling a little nervous.

30:33.240 --> 30:35.240
BROOKE: Hello!
(CHEERING)

30:35.240 --> 30:38.080
Wow!
(CHEERING AND LAUGHTER)

30:38.080 --> 30:39.840
Hey!
Yes, Queen!

30:39.840 --> 30:43.160
Yes, Queen!
(TRILLS)

30:43.160 --> 30:45.200
Holy shit!

30:45.200 --> 30:47.160
(LAUGHTER)

30:47.160 --> 30:49.120
Yes, Queen!
Yes!

30:49.120 --> 30:51.600
(LAUGHS)
Wow.

30:51.600 --> 30:54.680
Brooke is looking el fuego.

30:54.680 --> 30:56.240
She...wow.

30:56.240 --> 30:59.440
She looks absolutely breathtaking.

30:59.440 --> 31:02.000
Oh, give me some love!

31:02.000 --> 31:05.560
BROOKE: I love that the energy
is still high from Mardi Gras.

31:05.560 --> 31:07.160
Hello. My Queen.

31:07.160 --> 31:08.280
Oh, so much hair.
Oh, MY Queen.

31:08.280 --> 31:12.120
Everyone is just still so happy
and, like, energetic.

31:12.120 --> 31:16.440
I couldn't ask for a better
group of people vying for my heart.

31:16.440 --> 31:18.680
Thank you.
Absolutely lit.
Enjoy.

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
That's something else.
That's probably her best look yet.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.640
I really hope
she comes and grabs me.

31:26.640 --> 31:31.160
'Cause I feel like if not,
I am definitely going home.

31:35.480 --> 31:38.160
For me,
there was one huge standout today,

31:38.160 --> 31:41.560
who I really want to see.

31:41.560 --> 31:43.440
Holly.

31:45.080 --> 31:49.160
My doll! My doll!
My little disco babe. You go first.

31:57.920 --> 32:00.160
HOLLY:
Everyone's a crazy glove lady today.

32:00.160 --> 32:01.800
I always wear gloves.
I don't know if you noticed.

32:01.800 --> 32:02.800
(PURRS)

32:02.800 --> 32:04.000
Yeah.
Yeah. It's a vibe.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.480
It is. It's wild.
I'm feeling...I'm alive.

32:06.480 --> 32:08.000
I'm feeling myself tonight.
I know.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.720
I just love this whole get-up,
to be honest.

32:09.720 --> 32:12.680
Yeah. I just...it's actually...
You were so in your element today.

32:12.680 --> 32:15.120
Yeah.
Yeah. You're so passionate about it.

32:15.120 --> 32:16.360
I love it.
Yeah.

32:16.360 --> 32:19.680
I love how it comes out and...
it makes me happy to see you happy.

32:19.680 --> 32:22.120
Good. Good. I'm glad.

32:22.120 --> 32:24.720
I just wanted you to have
a really great day today.

32:24.720 --> 32:25.800
I honestly did.

32:25.800 --> 32:28.560
You looked like you did.
Yeah. Oh, my God.

32:29.680 --> 32:31.680
I really loved your energy today.

32:31.680 --> 32:35.200
Yay!
I think you are really beautiful.

32:35.200 --> 32:37.120
I hope that you know that, like,

32:37.120 --> 32:40.480
you know, I always feel, like,
really reassured with you.

32:40.480 --> 32:42.440
Good.

32:42.440 --> 32:46.200
That, like, you are here for me,
and I feel like you have, like,

32:46.200 --> 32:49.160
beautiful...
most beautiful intentions.

32:49.160 --> 32:54.040
And so, I have a little something...
(LAUGHS) Stop it.

32:58.560 --> 33:01.160
So, Holly, will you accept this rose?

33:01.160 --> 33:02.920
I will. I will.

33:02.920 --> 33:06.560
I think you know by now that I'm...
I'm all-in for you.

33:06.560 --> 33:07.960
Yeah.

33:07.960 --> 33:09.440
Come here.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.040
Getting this rose
is really lovely.

33:17.040 --> 33:19.840
It's really wonderful to see that...

33:19.840 --> 33:21.760
..she's enjoying seeing who I am

33:21.760 --> 33:25.080
and that
she's feeling a connection, and...

33:27.360 --> 33:31.080
..there couldn't have been
a better end to today.

33:33.320 --> 33:35.640
I really missed you.
Me too.

33:35.640 --> 33:37.040
Thank you for the...the rose...

33:37.040 --> 33:39.200
You did amazing today.
..and the chat.

33:39.200 --> 33:42.560
And the kisses.
Mmm. So...are we still kissing?

33:42.560 --> 33:43.960
We'll let it go?

33:46.600 --> 33:48.360
Mmm.

33:48.360 --> 33:51.680
You look beautiful.
You look even more beautiful.

33:53.320 --> 33:55.240
Don't want to leave, hey?

34:07.320 --> 34:08.360
Hi.

34:08.360 --> 34:11.000
I'm dropping off
my beautiful, lovely lady.

34:12.520 --> 34:14.840
She's got the rose in her boot.
KURT: She has?

34:14.840 --> 34:16.960
Yeah. She got it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

34:16.960 --> 34:20.200
Oh, with a...
what have you got there, Holl?

34:20.200 --> 34:21.400
Oh!
Yeah! (LAUGHS)

34:21.400 --> 34:23.520
This is subtle!

34:23.520 --> 34:25.200
Well done.
Congratulations.
Well done.

34:25.200 --> 34:27.240
Good work. Well done.

34:27.240 --> 34:29.880
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

34:30.920 --> 34:33.600
JAMIE-LEE:
I mean, I'm happy for Holly,

34:33.600 --> 34:36.920
but my heart's sinking.

34:36.920 --> 34:38.880
I was hoping it would be me.

34:38.880 --> 34:40.920
And I'm, like, "Oh, God."

34:40.920 --> 34:44.400
I can feel the cocktail party
is coming to an end.

34:44.400 --> 34:46.640
It's important
that I get time with Brooke.

34:46.640 --> 34:48.360
Tonight, I need to speak to Brooke,

34:48.360 --> 34:50.000
because if I don't,

34:50.000 --> 34:53.760
I feel like I'm going home.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.160
I don't want to create drama,

34:56.160 --> 34:58.480
and I am not here
to turn this cocktail party

34:58.480 --> 35:00.720
into one like the last.

35:03.320 --> 35:05.360
I just want to clear my name.

35:06.360 --> 35:07.720
WOMAN: Just go.
Oh. Alright.

35:07.720 --> 35:08.960
(LAUGHS)

35:15.000 --> 35:22.120
OSHER: Will you accept
these exclusive extras?

35:29.160 --> 35:30.200
Alright.

35:32.160 --> 35:33.640
LUCA: Where's Jamie-Lee gone?

35:34.800 --> 35:39.040
Looking over, I can see Jamie-Lee's
gone up to Brooke for a chat.

35:41.320 --> 35:44.160
Well, I'll tell you what,
I'm interested...

35:44.160 --> 35:46.280
..to see how this chat's gonna go.

35:46.280 --> 35:49.920
It's clear she's really
been wanting some time with Brooke

35:49.920 --> 35:50.960
the whole night.

35:50.960 --> 35:53.960
I can't tell what's going on,
but there's a bit of, like,

35:53.960 --> 35:56.840
body language
that's a little bit off.

35:56.840 --> 36:00.400
Uh, I think this is gonna be
a really interesting chat.

36:01.480 --> 36:03.120
JAMIE-LEE: Alright.

36:03.120 --> 36:05.840
So, I need to clear the air.

36:06.880 --> 36:08.920
It's really important
for me to speak to Brooke

36:08.920 --> 36:12.320
about the whole situation with Ryan,

36:12.320 --> 36:16.320
and I don't want to bring this
up again and make her upset again,

36:16.320 --> 36:20.600
but I also want Brooke to trust me,
so I need to bring it up,

36:20.600 --> 36:24.960
because I want Brooke to know that
I'm focused on her and her only.

36:26.360 --> 36:30.840
I know at the last cocktail party,
there was questions that you had

36:30.840 --> 36:33.840
revolving around
my friendship with Ryan.

36:34.840 --> 36:36.480
Um, and...

36:36.480 --> 36:39.240
..I just wanted to clear the air.

36:39.240 --> 36:41.240
Um, it was purely...it...

36:41.240 --> 36:43.160
..purely a friendship
between Ryan and I.

36:43.160 --> 36:44.640
You have my word.

36:44.640 --> 36:47.440
Um...and I would never come in here

36:47.440 --> 36:50.080
and have eyes
for anyone else other than you.

36:50.080 --> 36:52.000
I would never have done that.

36:52.000 --> 36:56.240
I-I'm sorry that you had to deal
with all of this crap over nothing.

36:58.160 --> 37:01.120
You are my sole reason
for being here.

37:01.120 --> 37:02.960
Oh.

37:02.960 --> 37:05.160
That really mean...
that means a lot to me, Jamie.

37:05.160 --> 37:09.440
There's some things that
have come up between Jamie-Lee and I,

37:09.440 --> 37:13.800
but I think the fact that she's so
open and so honest and raw about it

37:13.800 --> 37:16.520
is just a credit
to who she is as a person,

37:16.520 --> 37:18.480
and I really appreciate that.

37:19.840 --> 37:21.520
And you know what? (SIGHS)

37:21.520 --> 37:25.400
The truth is, I still
want to explore it with Jamie-Lee.

37:25.400 --> 37:27.240
I get it. I get it.

37:27.240 --> 37:31.840
I...look, right, for me in my mind,
that chapter is closed with Ryan.

37:31.840 --> 37:36.600
But I'm trying to figure out what is
the chapter of me and Jamie-Lee.

37:36.600 --> 37:38.160
I get that.
What does that look like?

37:38.160 --> 37:39.480
Yep.

37:39.480 --> 37:41.360
I can get how you feel.

37:41.360 --> 37:44.640
Like...it's been, like,
stop, start, stop, start. I get it.

37:44.640 --> 37:46.160
It's...
Mmm.
..it's shitty.

37:46.160 --> 37:47.320
It's shitty timing.

37:47.320 --> 37:51.000
I hope that it's something
that we can move forward through,

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
which is kind of...leads me to this.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.920
OK.

37:57.880 --> 37:59.840
You know I'm really sentimental.

37:59.840 --> 38:02.560
So, this is...

38:02.560 --> 38:04.120
..our story.

38:05.120 --> 38:07.800
Oh.
(BOTH LAUGH)

38:07.800 --> 38:10.920
Holy shit.
This is the first day we met.

38:10.920 --> 38:13.480
(LAUGHS)

38:13.480 --> 38:16.360
I always thought you were the hottest
thing walking in that two-piece.

38:16.360 --> 38:19.880
(LAUGHS) I think you look so cute.

38:19.880 --> 38:22.760
(LAUGHS) Um...

38:22.760 --> 38:26.000
The first time we hung out
on the outside.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.080
How did you get these cute photos?

38:28.080 --> 38:30.600
(LAUGHS) It was not easy.

38:30.600 --> 38:33.000
Cute.
(LAUGHS)

38:33.000 --> 38:34.800
This is our first date.

38:36.200 --> 38:39.240
That was very, very important to me.
(LAUGHS)

38:41.320 --> 38:42.920
The Sydney Tower Eye.

38:42.920 --> 38:44.400
(LAUGHS)

38:44.400 --> 38:45.960
You are so cute.

38:45.960 --> 38:50.080
A moment... (LAUGHS) ..that
was ridiculously special to me.

38:50.080 --> 38:52.440
I don't think I need to use words.

38:52.440 --> 38:55.840
You know, I hope that this
shows you how I feel.

38:55.840 --> 38:58.960
Um, I've left a lot of blank pages,

38:58.960 --> 39:01.920
because I want you to know
that I can see a future with you.

39:01.920 --> 39:03.320
I really can.

39:03.320 --> 39:05.720
I know it's been overshadowed
by shitty stuff.

39:05.720 --> 39:07.480
I'm hoping that we can forget it.

39:07.480 --> 39:10.000
I'm hoping that we can focus
on all of these empty pages

39:10.000 --> 39:12.240
and filling them
with firsts and memories.

39:12.240 --> 39:16.480
And I'm hoping that this can be
our little love story.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.760
'Cause I believe
that we have a chance.

39:22.760 --> 39:24.680
So this is for you.
Oh.

39:24.680 --> 39:26.160
And hopefully for us.
Thank you.

39:26.160 --> 39:27.880
That's reassuring, Jamie-Lee.

39:27.880 --> 39:30.960
It...it means a lot to me that you...

39:30.960 --> 39:33.800
..you know how much I love
the sentimental stuff as well.

39:33.800 --> 39:35.840
Yeah.
So it always makes my heart melt.

39:35.840 --> 39:37.160
But...yeah.

39:37.160 --> 39:39.200
It's...I want to...

39:39.200 --> 39:41.680
..get back on that trajectory.

39:41.680 --> 39:45.320
I get that. I just hope that...
I hope I get a chance.

39:45.320 --> 39:48.840
You're very important to me,
and I know what you're here for.

39:48.840 --> 39:51.720
Just know that I'm here
for the same thing.

39:51.720 --> 39:55.840
Jamie-Lee always knows
how to, like, win me over.

39:55.840 --> 39:57.200
Come and give me a hug.

39:57.200 --> 39:59.240
Thank you, babe.

40:00.920 --> 40:05.440
She's a very sentimental person,
and I love that about her,

40:05.440 --> 40:07.360
and I think...

40:08.960 --> 40:10.400
..she's won me over.

40:34.160 --> 40:38.600
JAMIE-LEE: I have given a gesture
of moving forward.

40:38.600 --> 40:42.880
I just hope that we're able
to move past this drama.

40:45.040 --> 40:48.520
And getting a rose
would signify that.

40:57.640 --> 40:59.560
Good evening, ladies.
Good evening, gentlemen.

41:01.680 --> 41:06.280
Coming together for
the pure joy of just spreading love

41:06.280 --> 41:08.360
must have left you all on a high.

41:08.360 --> 41:10.760
Because in the end,

41:10.760 --> 41:13.280
isn't love the reason
that each of you are here?

41:15.680 --> 41:18.160
It's certainly the reason
Brooke's here.

41:18.160 --> 41:19.960
Millie.

41:21.160 --> 41:22.800
Holly.

41:22.800 --> 41:28.200
Those roses take you one step closer
to the love you came here to find.

41:30.920 --> 41:34.440
But there are eight of you
that do not have a rose.

41:37.400 --> 41:40.080
And tonight,
Brooke has only six roses to give.

41:44.400 --> 41:46.200
I'm afraid that two of you

41:46.200 --> 41:49.440
will be leaving the mansion tonight.

41:55.040 --> 41:57.040
I wish you all the very best.

42:00.680 --> 42:02.280
Here's Brooke.

42:32.400 --> 42:33.800
Darvid.

42:39.240 --> 42:41.120
Darvid, will you accept this rose?

42:41.120 --> 42:42.720
Of course.
Thank you.

43:00.600 --> 43:02.120
Luca.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.320
Konrad.

43:21.480 --> 43:25.880
JAMIE-LEE: As
Brooke's calling out name by name...

43:29.480 --> 43:34.200
..she is still not really
making eye contact with me.

43:41.840 --> 43:43.120
Kurt.

43:53.680 --> 43:55.560
My heart's sinking.

44:03.680 --> 44:05.760
The pressure is getting to me.

44:14.560 --> 44:17.400
I'm trying not to cry.

44:19.000 --> 44:20.760
Will.

44:40.360 --> 44:42.560
After our chat,
I was feeling confident,

44:42.560 --> 44:44.360
but maybe she doesn't feel that way.

44:44.360 --> 44:47.200
Maybe she just doesn't
trust my word.

45:06.560 --> 45:08.120
Jamie-Lee.

45:15.800 --> 45:17.480
Jamie-Lee.

45:17.480 --> 45:19.200
Will you accept this rose?
I will.

45:19.200 --> 45:20.480
Thank you.

45:28.920 --> 45:30.400
(SIGHS)

45:36.360 --> 45:38.840
(SIGHS)

45:40.560 --> 45:41.960
Steve.

45:43.640 --> 45:44.800
Taje.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.160
I'm sorry,
but you did not receive a rose.

45:50.360 --> 45:53.040
Can you please take the time now
to say goodbye?

45:58.840 --> 46:00.680
I'm sorry, babe.

46:00.680 --> 46:02.160
See ya, mate.
Oh!

46:02.160 --> 46:04.240
Look after yourself, alright?

46:04.240 --> 46:07.360
I'm so thankful
that I get another chance.

46:10.280 --> 46:13.880
This is a sign that we're able
to move past this drama.

46:17.320 --> 46:20.520
We can really
put everything behind us...

46:22.440 --> 46:25.960
..and focus on the future,
and I'm so excited for that.

46:30.880 --> 46:33.000
(SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)
It's OK.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.400
(SNIFFS)

46:34.400 --> 46:35.680
It's OK.

46:41.120 --> 46:44.120
I just want you to know,
that you are such...

46:44.120 --> 46:46.480
..a strong and beautiful woman,

46:46.480 --> 46:48.680
inside and out.

46:48.680 --> 46:51.000
Just come here.
(SIGHS)

46:59.360 --> 47:03.360
You know, I'm so thankful
that I...I had you here.

47:03.360 --> 47:06.160
I'm sorry.
No.

47:10.200 --> 47:11.760
(KISSES)

47:11.760 --> 47:15.320
(KISSES)
(CLOSES DOOR)

47:16.440 --> 47:18.200
(SNIFFS)

47:18.200 --> 47:20.040
(SIGHS)

47:25.360 --> 47:27.040
TAJE: She's an amazing woman.

47:30.360 --> 47:33.880
And as another First Nation woman
myself... (BREATHES SHAKILY)

47:35.400 --> 47:38.920
..I just feel a lot of love for her.

47:38.920 --> 47:42.160
And I truly hope she finds
the person that she wants.

47:42.160 --> 47:43.560
(SOBS)

47:45.680 --> 47:48.760
Least I'm going out in glitter.
(LAUGHS AND SOBS)

47:52.000 --> 47:54.400
OSHER:
Next time on The Bachelorette...

47:56.760 --> 47:58.360
You've got first pick.

47:58.360 --> 48:00.480
Um, the girl in the orange shirt.

48:00.480 --> 48:02.520
Oh! OK.
Oh!

48:02.520 --> 48:03.880
Alright. Here we go.

48:03.880 --> 48:06.800
..Millie continues to be
a popular pick.

48:06.800 --> 48:09.800
Three, two, one! (BLASTS HORN)
Go, Mila!

48:09.800 --> 48:13.080
But does she take the competition
too far?

48:13.080 --> 48:14.880
Oh! Go, Mila!

48:14.880 --> 48:16.440
Millie's definitely forgotten
we're...

48:16.440 --> 48:17.960
..we're playing
with primary school kids.

48:17.960 --> 48:19.080
Jacob! Grab this one!

48:19.080 --> 48:20.480
No!

48:20.480 --> 48:22.680
Oh!
Contact!

48:22.680 --> 48:24.440
She's a cheater.
She's cheating. Stop.

48:24.440 --> 48:26.120
KONRAD: She's lost the point
of the day.

48:26.120 --> 48:27.960
Mila! Mila, Mila! Go that way!

48:27.960 --> 48:31.040
Before another race...
Alright, guys.

48:31.040 --> 48:32.760
"By the end of tonight,
Brooke will choose

48:32.760 --> 48:36.600
"the person who gets
the final single date."

48:36.600 --> 48:40.320
We need to be noticed, so tonight,
I want to make an impact.

48:40.320 --> 48:42.320
I'm gonna pull out
a little stop for Brooke tonight.

48:42.320 --> 48:43.920
I've got something special for you.

48:43.920 --> 48:46.440
..to leave
the very best last impression...

48:46.440 --> 48:47.960
Oh, my God!
I'm giving that to you.

48:47.960 --> 48:49.800
Cheers.
Cheers.
Yes.

48:49.800 --> 48:51.080
Oh, my God!

48:51.080 --> 48:52.280
Here she is.

48:52.280 --> 48:54.360
She's holding a rose and a card.

48:54.360 --> 48:56.400
Who's it gonna be?

48:56.400 --> 48:58.400
