WEBVTT

00:03.537 --> 00:05.339
Thanks for
letting me crash.
Mmm.

00:05.373 --> 00:08.276
I couldn't spend another
night in my apartment.
Mmm...

00:08.309 --> 00:09.777
You keep cooking
like this,

00:09.810 --> 00:12.146
I hope your landlord never
fixes the problem.
(laughs)

00:13.714 --> 00:15.449
How did your apartment
get infested with cats?

00:15.483 --> 00:17.185
Oh...

00:17.218 --> 00:19.320
Well, there's an
exotic bird shop

00:19.353 --> 00:20.521
on one side of
the building

00:20.554 --> 00:23.357
and a fish market
on the other.

00:23.391 --> 00:25.526
Once the yarn
store moved in,

00:25.559 --> 00:27.295
we were doomed.

00:27.328 --> 00:28.262
Oh, man.

00:28.296 --> 00:30.131
This is so good
I've been eating it too fast

00:30.164 --> 00:31.299
and got it all over my shirt.

00:31.332 --> 00:32.500
Oh, that's
gonna happen.

00:32.533 --> 00:35.303
When I'm alone, I usually eat
this meal with my shirt off.

00:35.336 --> 00:36.404
Oh.

00:36.437 --> 00:37.271
I guess I could
get a napkin.

00:37.305 --> 00:38.606
But they're all the
way in the kitchen.

00:44.645 --> 00:45.479
Ow.

00:45.513 --> 00:46.814
You all right there?
Here, let me get it.

00:46.847 --> 00:47.815
Let me get it.
Little help
in the back.

00:47.848 --> 00:49.550
Let me get it.
Let me get it.

00:52.753 --> 00:54.522
I told you they were
more than just friends.

00:56.390 --> 00:59.227
You owe me a foot rub
with lotion.

00:59.260 --> 01:00.794
No, no, I just
didn't want to get

01:00.828 --> 01:02.463
any of Ray's sauce on my shirt.

01:04.432 --> 01:06.467
Don't share a look!
It's not a euphemism.

01:06.500 --> 01:07.735
Can I help you guys
with something?

01:07.768 --> 01:10.304
Kip needs ice because of
his carpal tunnel.

01:10.338 --> 01:12.440
Syndrome.
It's a syndrome.

01:12.473 --> 01:13.707
I have a syndrome.

01:13.741 --> 01:16.244
A syndrome is worse
than a malady

01:16.277 --> 01:17.411
but not as bad
as an infirmity...

01:17.445 --> 01:20.681
I'm sorry, let me put this
in words you can understand.

01:20.714 --> 01:23.784
These feel ouchy.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.721
We haven't been able to
pinky swear in weeks.

01:27.755 --> 01:30.524
I don't know when he's lying.

01:30.558 --> 01:32.393
Oh, look. Chuck Manners
from Channel Three.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.262
I love that guy.
Turn it up.

01:34.295 --> 01:35.896
Chuck Manners here,
reporting live

01:35.929 --> 01:37.598
from the parade route
in Washington

01:37.631 --> 01:38.866
where in just six short days,

01:38.899 --> 01:40.534
Pope Francis will be
making a visit.

01:40.568 --> 01:42.370
And I can't believe
I'm here talking

01:42.403 --> 01:44.138
with supermodel Tyra Banks...

01:44.172 --> 01:46.140
Wait, you're not Tyra Banks.

01:46.174 --> 01:48.309
You're prettier than she is.

01:48.342 --> 01:49.543
(turns off TV)

01:49.577 --> 01:51.579
Come on!
I can't believe him.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.481
A six-day
Pope watch?

01:53.514 --> 01:56.317
Five is the
industry standard.

01:56.350 --> 01:58.386
There are rules to mid-day
human interest beat reporters.

01:58.419 --> 01:59.787
I should know.
I'm the one who printed 'em up

01:59.820 --> 02:01.622
and sent 'em around.

02:01.655 --> 02:03.457
Nathan, you've
been spooned!

02:03.491 --> 02:06.360
Your rival has
totally spooned you.

02:06.394 --> 02:07.561
Well, it's "scooped," Mom.

02:07.595 --> 02:09.397
I... I've been "scooped."

02:09.430 --> 02:10.598
God, I hate this guy.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.700
You know, we were both covering
the Leesburg wishing well

02:12.733 --> 02:14.568
and he threw my keys in the well

02:14.602 --> 02:17.205
and wished me good luck beating
him to the next story.

02:17.238 --> 02:18.539
Joke was on him, though.

02:18.572 --> 02:19.873
'Cause the next story was

02:19.907 --> 02:22.876
"local reporter stuck
in wishing well."

02:22.910 --> 02:25.546
When did you guys get a cat?

02:25.579 --> 02:27.315
Oh, no, they got in my suitcase!

02:29.550 --> 02:31.185
Don't worry, I'll get 'em out!
Don't worry!

02:31.219 --> 02:33.554
(barking)

02:58.346 --> 03:01.349
From the Pope's parade route,
this is Nathan Miller reporting.

03:01.382 --> 03:02.450
That was great.

03:02.483 --> 03:03.951
Let's try one more,
without the hat.

03:03.984 --> 03:04.918
Yeah, good idea.

03:04.952 --> 03:07.388
Still get a lot of angry
letters from the time

03:07.421 --> 03:09.723
I dressed as Super "Mare-yo" at
the Italian-American Festival.

03:09.757 --> 03:10.858
It's "Mario."

03:10.891 --> 03:13.494
And in three... two... one.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.663
With just four days remaining
until the Pope's visit,

03:15.696 --> 03:16.930
people have begun
lining up already.

03:16.964 --> 03:18.065
People like
Sarah Davis, who...

03:18.098 --> 03:19.099
...and with four days left
until the Pope's arrival,

03:19.132 --> 03:22.503
the streets are already
crowded with "papal."

03:22.536 --> 03:23.637
Excuse me. What are you doing?

03:23.671 --> 03:25.406
We're doing
a stop-and-chat here.

03:25.439 --> 03:26.607
Well, we are doing
a walk-and-talk.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.342
Oka, well, you can't
do a walk-and-talk

03:28.376 --> 03:29.343
through our
stop-and-chat.

03:29.377 --> 03:30.478
It's just like
when we did

03:30.511 --> 03:32.012
the meet-and-greet at
the pitch-and-putt.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.180
Or the hit-and-run
and the park-and-ride.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.283
We have this side
of the street,
you have the other side.

03:35.316 --> 03:36.784
You know damn well the light
on the other side of the street

03:36.817 --> 03:38.419
goes bad after 2:30.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.521
Maybe a little shadow is
just what your face needs.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.623
Funny, coming from a man
who uses eye shadow.

03:42.656 --> 03:44.825
It's eye shadow for men.

03:44.858 --> 03:46.927
It's guy shadow.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.329
Get it at
the Home Depot.

03:48.362 --> 03:50.564
Doesn't matter.
Ray, let's just go again.

03:50.598 --> 03:51.499
In five...

03:51.532 --> 03:52.733
In three...
One!

03:52.766 --> 03:53.701
Ma'am, you've
been here...
Ma'am, you've
been out here

03:53.734 --> 03:54.768
...for a few days.
...for seven
whole days.

03:54.802 --> 03:57.104
What have you
been eating?
You notice anything...

03:57.137 --> 03:58.406
Is that a donut?
You know what? You don't
have to give him a taste.

03:58.439 --> 03:59.573
Just gonna get
a taste of that.
Okay, right
over here, ma'am,

03:59.607 --> 04:00.774
that would
be fantastic.
Just a bite
of that donut.

04:00.808 --> 04:03.511
Hey, you know what? Can you get
your own bystander, please?

04:03.544 --> 04:05.346
No. I really want
to interview her.

04:05.379 --> 04:06.814
It's one thing the
Pope is coming to town,

04:06.847 --> 04:09.417
it's a whole 'nother thing
supermodel Gisele Bundchen

04:09.450 --> 04:10.418
is out here
waiting to see him.

04:10.451 --> 04:11.419
What?

04:11.452 --> 04:13.321
You thought I was Gisele?

04:13.354 --> 04:16.457
These teeth whitening strips
are a miracle.

04:16.490 --> 04:17.625
Oh, come on.

04:17.658 --> 04:19.059
You don't look
anything like Gisele.

04:19.092 --> 04:20.861
(laughs)

04:22.530 --> 04:23.864
...because you look
so much like Heidi Klum.

04:23.897 --> 04:24.865
I was just...

04:24.898 --> 04:26.400
Don't pander to me.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.302
I look nothing like Heidi Klum.

04:28.336 --> 04:30.404
I want to be interviewed by him.

04:30.438 --> 04:31.505
Fine.

04:31.539 --> 04:33.341
CHUCK:
Tell the station I want
to go live with this.

04:33.374 --> 04:35.042
Ma'am, if you could
just step over here,

04:35.075 --> 04:37.511
we can frame out that
homeless guy eating a pigeon.

04:37.545 --> 04:39.547
You're just going to give up?

04:40.914 --> 04:42.916
Oh, I didn't give up.

04:43.951 --> 04:46.520
(car alarm blaring)

04:46.554 --> 04:47.688
(car alarm continues blaring)
This is...

04:47.721 --> 04:48.689
Chuck Manners...

04:48.722 --> 04:50.991
on a glo... rious day...

04:51.024 --> 04:51.992
on the...

04:52.025 --> 04:53.327
Pope's parade route.

04:53.361 --> 04:54.362
That's it!

04:55.729 --> 04:56.797
Shut up!

04:56.830 --> 04:58.466
Shut up! Shut up!

04:58.499 --> 05:00.434
Shut up!

05:02.503 --> 05:04.972
It's too bad the car alarm
ruined his report.

05:05.005 --> 05:07.575
I hate it when bad things
happen to good-looking people.

05:09.577 --> 05:10.611
Me, too.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.646
It's why the Paula Deen
scandal hit me so hard.

05:14.582 --> 05:15.949
Oh! Don't mind us,

05:15.983 --> 05:17.418
we're just taking a pit stop

05:17.451 --> 05:18.819
in the middle of training
for the parade.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.388
Yeah.

05:20.421 --> 05:23.023
I plan on power-walking
the entire Pope parade.

05:23.056 --> 05:24.625
We're dressed
like Power Rangers

05:24.658 --> 05:26.660
because I can't wave
to get his attention.

05:28.061 --> 05:29.430
And... time.

05:29.463 --> 05:30.731
Oh...
Whew.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.466
Hopefully, the
Pope can help.

05:32.500 --> 05:36.570
I can't use the clapper my
mom got me for my birthday.

05:36.604 --> 05:38.739
My bedside light has
been on for three weeks.

05:40.474 --> 05:42.676
Well, if you want,
I could ask him for you.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.445
Francis and I are old friends.

05:44.478 --> 05:45.679
You're friends with the Pope?

05:45.713 --> 05:46.480
He's not friends with the Pope.

05:46.514 --> 05:47.448
You're not friends
with the Pope.

05:47.481 --> 05:48.849
She says you're not
friends with the Pope.

05:48.882 --> 05:49.850
Are you friends with the Pope?

05:49.883 --> 05:51.084
He's not friends with the Pope!

05:53.421 --> 05:54.822
I met him at a bar once

05:54.855 --> 05:56.590
on a business trip to Argentina.

05:56.624 --> 05:57.991
We instantly hit it off.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.493
He's the one who
taught me how to...

05:59.527 --> 06:02.663
(rolling words):
...talk underwater.

06:04.498 --> 06:05.833
And because
they're friends,

06:05.866 --> 06:07.468
Grandpa and I can
do whatever we want

06:07.501 --> 06:08.636
and still get
into Heaven.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.638
I said I'd put in a
good word for you.

06:10.671 --> 06:13.641
I didn't make
any guarantees.

06:13.674 --> 06:15.075
Tom, I'm begging you

06:15.108 --> 06:16.877
to come to the parade
and introduce us.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.979
All I need is one touch,
a graze,

06:19.012 --> 06:20.481
a wet cough on my wrists...

06:21.582 --> 06:24.652
He can sneeze and
I'll walk under it.

06:24.685 --> 06:25.686
(sniffing)

06:25.719 --> 06:26.987
KIP:
Do you think the Pope
will remember you?

06:27.020 --> 06:28.155
TOM:
Of course he will.

06:28.188 --> 06:29.790
I still send him
my Christmas list...

06:29.823 --> 06:32.560
(gargling):
...every year.

06:34.928 --> 06:37.030
I thought I smelled hot glue.

06:38.599 --> 06:39.967
What's going on in here?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.835
Just a little arts
and crafts project.

06:41.869 --> 06:42.903
I see that.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.472
With my craft supplies.

06:44.505 --> 06:45.873
There are three things of mine

06:45.906 --> 06:47.074
I don't like people touching.

06:47.107 --> 06:49.677
My craft supplies,
my coupon scissors,

06:49.710 --> 06:50.978
and if you want to know
the third thing,

06:51.011 --> 06:53.413
ask your father,
but prepare to be embarrassed.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.518
Don't worry, Carol,
we'll pay you back.

06:57.551 --> 06:58.719
This is an investment, okay?

06:58.752 --> 07:00.087
We're selling all our
leftover merchandise

07:00.120 --> 07:01.789
from the cafe
in the Pope parade.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.657
Yeah, yeah.
Check it out.

07:03.691 --> 07:04.892
So we took those organic soaps,

07:04.925 --> 07:06.159
carved them into crosses,

07:06.193 --> 07:07.461
put a piece of yarn through it,

07:07.495 --> 07:08.462
slapped a Pope's hat on it

07:08.496 --> 07:09.730
and bam, Pope on a Rope.

07:09.763 --> 07:10.731
What?

07:10.764 --> 07:12.466
ADAM:
Yeah.

07:12.500 --> 07:13.601
And get this.

07:13.634 --> 07:14.802
We had a ton of
extra yoga mats

07:14.835 --> 07:16.003
and no way to get
rid of them.

07:16.036 --> 07:18.205
So we just dressed them up
with a little bit of glitter,

07:18.238 --> 07:21.609
glued a Pope hat on there
and bam, Holy Mat!

07:23.544 --> 07:25.479
Look, Mom, you were
nice enough to help us

07:25.513 --> 07:27.581
invest in the cafe and
since that didn't work out,

07:27.615 --> 07:29.016
we really want
to pay you back.

07:29.049 --> 07:30.017
Oh, sweetheart.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.485
You don't have to pay me back.

07:31.519 --> 07:33.153
It's like giving money
to the Girl Scouts.

07:33.186 --> 07:34.254
Part of it, I want to help,

07:34.287 --> 07:37.457
but mostly it's because
I want you out of my house.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.728
Just put everything
back when you're done--

07:40.761 --> 07:42.763
and I know exactly how
many pipe cleaners I have,

07:42.796 --> 07:45.666
so stay away from them.

07:45.699 --> 07:46.667
We will.

07:46.700 --> 07:47.501
But just so you know,

07:47.535 --> 07:49.002
we are going
to pay you back.
Mm-hmm.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.604
That's sweet.

07:50.638 --> 07:52.072
It's a good thing
the Pope's in town,

07:52.105 --> 07:54.742
because it'll take a miracle
to sell any of those things.

07:56.677 --> 07:57.945
Pope on a Rope?

07:57.978 --> 07:59.046
(laughs)

07:59.079 --> 08:02.550
What's next?
Mr. Pope-tato Head?

08:03.651 --> 08:05.218
Well, that was
a little rude.

08:05.252 --> 08:06.620
Yeah.

08:06.654 --> 08:08.188
But I am glad that we
didn't show her this.

08:08.221 --> 08:09.222
Yeah.

08:14.828 --> 08:15.829
Hey, Ray.

08:15.863 --> 08:17.665
Nathan, I just wanted to
return the ice I borrowed

08:17.698 --> 08:18.532
and get some more.

08:18.566 --> 08:19.867
It's all here,
if you want to count it.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.969
(phone ringing)

08:24.572 --> 08:25.673
Unknown number.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.207
Ooh, you should
answer that.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.642
It could be
Greg Kinnear.

08:28.676 --> 08:30.077
I know for a fact
his number's unlisted.

08:31.111 --> 08:31.612
Hello.

08:31.645 --> 08:33.046
Can I speak with Ray?

08:33.080 --> 08:34.715
This is him.
Really?

08:34.748 --> 08:37.618
Because you sound just
like Denzel Washington.

08:37.651 --> 08:39.787
Hey, Nate, it's
Chuck Manners.

08:39.820 --> 08:40.854
You're kidding.

08:40.888 --> 08:43.624
Put him on speaker.

08:43.657 --> 08:46.093
Ray-rover, Ray-rover,
how'd you like to come over

08:46.126 --> 08:48.328
and work for the number
one local news

08:48.361 --> 08:51.098
human-interest field reporter
in northeast Virginia?

08:51.131 --> 08:53.100
Unless you like
working for peanuts.

08:53.133 --> 08:56.236
Which is what I call Nathan,
because of his tiny nuts.

08:57.671 --> 08:59.607
I understand.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.842
Mine are huge and
it's no picnic, either.

09:04.778 --> 09:07.648
Especially at a picnic.

09:07.681 --> 09:09.817
Hey, Chuck, I'm
flattered, man, but...

09:09.850 --> 09:11.652
Look, you're
an unbelievable cameraman.

09:11.685 --> 09:13.721
I know what you make
over at WXD-Lame

09:13.754 --> 09:15.789
and I'll increase
it by 20%.

09:15.823 --> 09:17.725
Think about it
and call me back.

09:17.758 --> 09:19.860
Hurry up, Dad.
I have a dinner date.

09:22.696 --> 09:24.598
Oh, my God, Ray.

09:24.632 --> 09:26.066
A 20% raise?

09:26.099 --> 09:27.701
You could buy that house
you always wanted.

09:27.735 --> 09:28.636
Yeah.

09:28.669 --> 09:29.670
Or hair.

09:31.739 --> 09:33.741
Look, Ray's not taking the job.

09:33.774 --> 09:36.810
Chuck's just trying
to piss me off.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.714
Is that what you think?

09:42.816 --> 09:45.719
You know, maybe it wasn't
just to piss you off.

09:45.753 --> 09:48.188
I mean, he did say
I'm an amazing cameraman.

09:48.221 --> 09:49.690
Well, yeah, but come on.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.191
I mean, he's just trying
to get back at me.

09:51.224 --> 09:54.227
Wait, so are you saying Ray's
not an amazing cameraman?

09:55.996 --> 09:57.965
Are you saying that Ray
is not an amazing cameraman?

09:57.998 --> 09:59.967
That's not what I'm saying.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.035
I... look, no one is
as steady as you.

10:02.069 --> 10:04.037
I still tell people
how you held your sneeze

10:04.071 --> 10:05.806
at the pepper festival.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.040
I don't know.

10:07.074 --> 10:09.810
This sounds like you're not
appreciating how hard Ray works.

10:09.843 --> 10:10.878
Is that how you feel, Nate?

10:10.911 --> 10:12.312
You don't think my job is hard?

10:12.345 --> 10:14.982
No!

10:15.015 --> 10:16.917
No, I think it's hard.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.819
You're lying,
your voice just went up

10:18.852 --> 10:19.853
(higher):
like this.

10:21.321 --> 10:22.990
No, it didn't.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.157
You can't even stop it.

10:24.191 --> 10:25.759
There's nothing to stop.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.227
I don't even know
what you guys...

10:27.260 --> 10:28.628
(laughs nervously)

10:29.830 --> 10:34.434
I think he thinks you just point
the camera and press record.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.771
You think all I do is point
the camera and press record?

10:37.805 --> 10:39.139
No, you know I don't think that.

10:39.172 --> 10:41.174
I get the feeling
Nate thinks

10:41.208 --> 10:44.845
that cameramen aren't much more
than glorified tripods.

10:44.878 --> 10:47.080
Come on, I never said that.

10:47.114 --> 10:48.916
You think my job is easy?

10:48.949 --> 10:50.751
All you do is
stand around and talk.

10:50.784 --> 10:53.020
That's what I do when
I'm taking a break from my job!

10:53.053 --> 10:54.822
You take that back.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.690
My job is very hard.

10:56.724 --> 10:59.259
I have to deal with wind
trying to mess up my hair.

11:00.894 --> 11:03.864
Rain trying to mess up my hair.

11:03.897 --> 11:06.867
Birds, handsy children, fans--

11:06.900 --> 11:09.002
all trying to mess up my hair.

11:09.036 --> 11:12.005
Exactly, all you have to do
is look pretty and wear a suit.

11:12.039 --> 11:14.207
Hey, I resent that,
but I also appreciate it.

11:14.241 --> 11:16.076
Thank you for saying
I look pretty.

11:16.109 --> 11:17.377
You know what?

11:17.410 --> 11:19.046
Maybe I should work for someone

11:19.079 --> 11:20.881
who respects me a little more.

11:20.914 --> 11:22.783
Like 20 percent more.

11:22.816 --> 11:24.785
Oh, come on, man, you wouldn't
leave me during Pope week.

11:24.818 --> 11:25.786
Watch me.

11:25.819 --> 11:26.854
Watch him.

11:26.887 --> 11:30.891
I can't believe he just
left you during Pope week.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.761
Whose side are you on?

11:33.794 --> 11:36.797
Oh, I make it a point to stay
out of other people's fights.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.805
Don't!

11:44.838 --> 11:46.840
Don't help.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.411
No, you're not...

11:51.444 --> 11:54.281
I need to learn how to do this.

12:01.388 --> 12:05.092
And, lastly, I'd like to send
a shout-out to my son, Dustin.

12:05.125 --> 12:07.160
I'm sorry I didn't get
to see you this month.

12:07.194 --> 12:08.829
That judge is a jerk.

12:08.862 --> 12:09.830
And cut.

12:09.863 --> 12:10.831
How was that, Ray?

12:10.864 --> 12:11.932
I think maybe we could, uh...

12:11.965 --> 12:13.266
Great, great,
keep the ideas coming.

12:14.301 --> 12:16.003
Hey, Nathan Miller.

12:16.036 --> 12:17.404
Does your face hurt?

12:17.437 --> 12:19.472
'Cause it's
killing me.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.308
No, does your face hurt?

12:21.341 --> 12:23.243
'Cause it's killing me.

12:24.912 --> 12:26.880
Touché.

12:26.914 --> 12:28.882
So, who'd they
replace me with?

12:28.916 --> 12:29.950
Fast Eddie?

12:29.983 --> 12:31.018
Short Stan?

12:31.051 --> 12:32.085
White Ray?

12:32.119 --> 12:34.287
Nope, they hired
an amazing new girl.

12:34.321 --> 12:36.957
She's firm, thin,
and has great legs.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.959
Three of them.

12:38.992 --> 12:43.296
Yeah, like you,
she, uh, has her ups and downs,

12:43.330 --> 12:45.132
and has a screw loose.

12:45.165 --> 12:46.834
But unlike you,

12:46.867 --> 12:47.935
I can tighten it.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.870
Which means she'll never
abandon me during Pope week.

12:53.506 --> 12:56.476
With only days remaining
until the Pope arrives,

12:56.509 --> 12:59.880
the city is ready
to greet a noble man who,

12:59.913 --> 13:02.549
although surrounded
by people, must feel...

13:02.582 --> 13:04.051
so alone.

13:08.555 --> 13:10.523
I mean, what other
color could it be?

13:10.557 --> 13:12.359
Just call your restaurant
"Lobster."

13:22.870 --> 13:24.972
Hit me, Nate,
I'm wide open.

13:31.044 --> 13:33.013
Mmm.

13:33.046 --> 13:34.915
Ah-ah-ah, bad
for your figure.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.483
Bad for your face.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.518
Mmm.

13:48.929 --> 13:50.497
Come on, man.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.165
You're getting that spaghetti
sauce on your shirt.

13:52.199 --> 13:54.935
Here, let me help you
take it off.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.453
Holy mats!

14:13.486 --> 14:15.422
Pope-on-a-rope!

14:15.455 --> 14:17.424
Nobody wants any of this stuff.

14:17.457 --> 14:20.327
Give it to me straight,
am I out of my cute phase?

14:20.360 --> 14:22.029
Oh.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.330
Honey.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.165
That's such
a good question,

14:25.198 --> 14:26.599
'cause these are
really cool items.

14:28.969 --> 14:30.237
Here's my idea.

14:30.270 --> 14:32.072
We'll start on the church
in the distance,

14:32.105 --> 14:33.406
we'll pan down
from the steeple,

14:33.440 --> 14:35.442
to find you here
with all the people.

14:35.475 --> 14:37.344
Why don't you use
your creativity,

14:37.377 --> 14:38.511
and go get me a
colorful snow cone.

14:38.545 --> 14:41.414
Pope's gonna be here in five,
got to do my face yoga.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.622
TOM: Whoa, there's a lot more
cops here than I thought.

14:49.656 --> 14:51.992
I don't think we can
get close to him.

14:52.025 --> 14:55.595
Tom, I am in constant,
low-level pain

14:55.628 --> 14:58.098
that's alleviated
by simple aspirin.

14:58.131 --> 14:59.232
We have to meet him.

14:59.266 --> 15:00.600
I don't know...

15:00.633 --> 15:02.069
Okay.

15:02.102 --> 15:03.636
Some of this is gonna
be hypothetical

15:03.670 --> 15:05.605
because of
my syndrome.

15:05.638 --> 15:06.539
Tom!

15:06.573 --> 15:08.608
I am grabbing you by
the lapels right now.

15:08.641 --> 15:09.609
Snap out of it!

15:09.642 --> 15:10.677
I just slapped you.

15:10.710 --> 15:13.113
Do you understand how
important this is to me?!

15:13.146 --> 15:14.114
I'm shaking you.

15:14.147 --> 15:16.116
Now, when that Pope comes,
you get out there...

15:16.149 --> 15:17.284
I'm pointing
to the street.

15:17.317 --> 15:18.318
And introduce me!

15:18.351 --> 15:19.319
You got it?

15:19.352 --> 15:21.188
Okay.
Good.

15:21.221 --> 15:22.555
(clicks tongue)

15:22.589 --> 15:25.025
I just gave you
an encouraging pat on the bum.

15:31.164 --> 15:32.532
That shot sounded pretty cool.

15:32.565 --> 15:33.533
Huh?

15:33.566 --> 15:35.535
That-that shot with the steeple,

15:35.568 --> 15:36.703
it sounded pretty, you know...

15:36.736 --> 15:38.271
Yeah, cool, huh?
Yeah.

15:38.305 --> 15:40.140
That's what I thought,
you know, kind of like...

15:40.173 --> 15:42.175
Yeah, um, I thought
it might be good

15:42.209 --> 15:43.176
when you,
when you come down,

15:43.210 --> 15:44.011
you find the people...

15:44.044 --> 15:46.279
Just him talking.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:46.313 --> 15:47.514
Yeah, and then you just
sort of snake through the crowd.

15:47.547 --> 15:48.515
Exactly-- snake, snake, snake.

15:48.548 --> 15:51.018
BOTH:
And then-- bam!

15:51.051 --> 15:53.186
Hero shot.

15:55.322 --> 15:56.589
Yeah.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.625
Well, I guess those
days are over.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.495
Ah, Ray, this is
stupid, man.

16:02.529 --> 16:04.731
Come on, I'm sorry
about what I said.
Yeah, I am, too, man.

16:04.764 --> 16:07.234
I'm sorry about all those
rumors I spread about you.

16:07.267 --> 16:08.501
Wait, what rumors?

16:08.535 --> 16:10.970
Stay away from zoos, weirdo.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.507
Ah, man, this sucks.

16:14.541 --> 16:16.309
I asked the boss
about hiring you back,

16:16.343 --> 16:17.510
and he said he likes
the tripod.

16:17.544 --> 16:18.345
Saves the station
money,

16:18.378 --> 16:20.347
and, as long as
he gets a decent shot,

16:20.380 --> 16:21.448
he's not changing
a thing.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.616
Damn, we really
screwed ourselves.

16:25.652 --> 16:28.455
You know, maybe it's time
that we unscrew ourselves.

16:28.488 --> 16:29.622
What are you
doing, man?

16:29.656 --> 16:31.158
Getting my
cameraman back.

16:32.359 --> 16:33.360
CHUCK:
Wrap it up, Ray.

16:33.393 --> 16:34.361
Pope is coming.

16:34.394 --> 16:35.228
I'm gonna pee
one more time.

16:35.262 --> 16:36.596
Don't let anyone look
down that alley.

16:36.629 --> 16:38.031
Oh, gotcha, gotcha.

16:38.065 --> 16:39.099
I can't let you do this, Nate.

16:39.132 --> 16:41.501
This is too big of a news
story for you to blow.

16:41.534 --> 16:42.602
You know what, Ray?

16:42.635 --> 16:45.372
Sometimes friendship is
more important than the news.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.309
Okay.
(crowd cheers)

16:49.342 --> 16:51.311
(clears throat)

16:51.344 --> 16:52.812
The moment is
finally here, folks.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.814
The crowd is buzzing
with electricity

16:54.847 --> 16:56.483
as Pope Francis approaches.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.451
The-the...

16:58.485 --> 17:01.288
the Pope is said to be forgoing
his usual armored Popemobile

17:01.321 --> 17:04.324
because he says he wants
to be among the people.

17:06.326 --> 17:07.794
Today is just one of those days

17:07.827 --> 17:09.462
where everyone here
will always remember

17:09.496 --> 17:12.465
the day they saw the Pope.

17:12.499 --> 17:15.135
And wasn't it glorious.

17:15.168 --> 17:16.469
KIP:
Francis!

17:16.503 --> 17:18.471
Long-time prayer,
first-time shouter!

17:18.505 --> 17:19.772
I need your help!

17:19.806 --> 17:22.075
Jorge, it's me, Tomas!

17:22.109 --> 17:24.144
You told me about the wisdom
of Saint Francis,

17:24.177 --> 17:26.179
I sold you a broken camera!

17:26.213 --> 17:28.181
O-Ouch, ow, ow!

17:28.215 --> 17:29.149
This is Chuck Manners,

17:29.182 --> 17:31.351
still with you live
from the Papal parade

17:31.384 --> 17:33.320
where we now have
the Leesburg exclusive.

17:33.353 --> 17:35.388
KIP: I have a syndrome,
I have a syndrome, sir!

17:35.422 --> 17:37.357
I have a syndrome! I... Oh!

17:37.390 --> 17:39.192
(crowd groans)

17:39.226 --> 17:40.660
Pope down.

17:40.693 --> 17:43.330
Those mats just
saved the Pope.

17:43.363 --> 17:44.664
Bless these mats.

17:44.697 --> 17:46.233
(kisses)

17:46.266 --> 17:47.434
He just blessed
these mats.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.202
I want a mat.
O-Oh.

17:49.236 --> 17:51.204
Oh. (laughs)

17:51.238 --> 17:54.307
Oh, I told Mom these mats
would sell, I was right.

17:54.341 --> 17:56.609
Yeah, but she said it would take
a miracle, so she was right.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.278
Oh, God,
she always wins.

17:58.311 --> 17:59.279
Damn it.

17:59.312 --> 18:00.780
Oh, I mean, "darn it."

18:00.813 --> 18:02.081
Sorry, Pope.

18:08.455 --> 18:10.123
KIP:
Shh, be quiet.

18:10.157 --> 18:11.458
My part's about to be on.

18:11.491 --> 18:12.759
And I'm joined by
one of the men

18:12.792 --> 18:14.661
who accosted Pope Francis
in Sunday's parade.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.296
Sir, I understand that you were
trying to get the Pope

18:16.329 --> 18:18.165
to heal
your carpal tunnel.

18:18.198 --> 18:19.299
Yes, syndrome.

18:19.332 --> 18:20.633
And it worked.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.635
Now I can go back to
my volunteer work.

18:22.669 --> 18:25.338
Uh, helping people
parallel park.

18:25.372 --> 18:27.874
This goes to show that even
when things seem the darkest,

18:27.907 --> 18:30.543
there's always a light
at the end of the carpal tunnel.

18:30.577 --> 18:32.579
Syndrome.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.386
I don't remember
the rainbow.

18:39.419 --> 18:40.520
Did you add
special effects?

18:40.553 --> 18:43.423
Let's see a
tripod do that.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.425
I'm sorry the boss
wouldn't give you a raise,

18:45.458 --> 18:47.660
and you got to stay
in that cat-infested apartment.

18:47.694 --> 18:49.262
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.

18:49.296 --> 18:51.664
I can't open a can of tuna
without starting a riot.

18:53.566 --> 18:54.667
Man, you love your tuna.

18:54.701 --> 18:56.269
Yeah, I miss it, man.

18:56.303 --> 18:59.406
Last night, I tried to make
a tuna melt with no tuna.

18:59.439 --> 19:01.508
That's just a damn
grilled cheese.

19:03.576 --> 19:05.778
Hey, why don't you move
into my apartment?

19:05.812 --> 19:07.447
Yeah, with the money
that you save on rent,

19:07.480 --> 19:09.649
it'll make up for the raise
you didn't get.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.418
Come on, man, you just got
your mom out of there.

19:11.451 --> 19:12.652
Yeah, but still
this is a step up.

19:12.685 --> 19:13.920
I mean, you cook
better than her,

19:13.953 --> 19:15.288
you won't go through my stuff.

19:15.322 --> 19:16.489
And if our underwear gets
mixed up,

19:16.523 --> 19:17.924
I won't get embarrassed
at the gym.

19:19.792 --> 19:21.561
You know what, here,
here, here, perfect.

19:21.594 --> 19:22.695
Look at this.

19:22.729 --> 19:23.663
Got one here.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.932
This is for the front door,
and this one...

19:25.965 --> 19:28.167
Ah, man.

19:33.406 --> 19:35.642
I knew it, they're engaged.

19:37.410 --> 19:38.478
You owe me another foot rub.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.313
But no lotion this time,
that was weird.

19:40.347 --> 19:41.481
No.

19:41.514 --> 19:42.382
Guys, we're not...

19:42.415 --> 19:44.684
This is just so he can
get in my back door.

19:47.387 --> 19:50.390
Don't share a look,
that was not a euphemism, I...
