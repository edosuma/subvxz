41:07.430 --> 41:09.329
Dead.

41:10.433 --> 41:12.933
Dead. Dead.

41:16.839 --> 41:19.085
Anything I did, right or wrong,

41:20.108 --> 41:21.708
I did for you.

41:27.416 --> 41:28.948
Caleb's waiting.

41:30.251 --> 41:32.485
I'll help you and Thomas
down to the cove.

41:32.521 --> 41:34.186
We'll manage.

41:43.631 --> 41:45.862
Are you sure that you have to enlist?

41:46.500 --> 41:48.573
It's just a cloak for a day.

41:49.470 --> 41:52.243
A disguise, like this
mission to get Arnold.

41:52.994 --> 41:54.579
What do you mean?

41:55.341 --> 41:57.875
My quarry is Simcoe.
That's all I care about.

42:00.513 --> 42:02.713
Then I just have one piece of advice.

42:04.216 --> 42:05.483
Don't miss.
