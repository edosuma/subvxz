WEBVTT

00:07.663 --> 00:09.510
Terrible.

00:09.534 --> 00:12.788
T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E. Terrible.

00:12.812 --> 00:15.307
Correct. Try "giraffe."

00:15.308 --> 00:17.678
G-I-R-A-F...

00:17.702 --> 00:19.724
- F-E?
- Nice.

00:29.534 --> 00:31.686
If I get one more,

00:31.710 --> 00:33.210
can I have 30 minutes
of extra screen time?

00:33.234 --> 00:35.559
Maybe 15 if you get this one.

00:36.143 --> 00:37.342
Naughty.

00:38.761 --> 00:40.652
I-Is naughty one of those weird ones?

00:40.676 --> 00:42.306
Um, you think about it.

00:42.330 --> 00:43.896
I'll be right back.

01:07.897 --> 01:10.150
It says there's naughty like being bad

01:10.174 --> 01:12.110
and knotty like having a lot of knots.

01:12.134 --> 01:13.554
I can spell both now, though.

01:13.578 --> 01:15.121
So basically, I win.

01:17.365 --> 01:19.018
That's odd.

01:25.866 --> 01:27.435
You goof.

01:27.459 --> 01:28.662
Don't make a sound.

01:28.686 --> 01:29.962
What?

01:36.297 --> 01:38.874
- Where is he?
- I have him.

01:39.958 --> 01:42.540
You're going to do exactly what I say.

01:42.564 --> 01:45.282
And only what I say,
starting with no police.

01:45.306 --> 01:47.371
I'll be in touch.

01:57.492 --> 01:59.849
It was one of those old houses.

01:59.873 --> 02:03.119
The chimneys are wide...
and it was the middle of winter,

02:03.143 --> 02:05.693
so I figured the flue would be open.

02:05.717 --> 02:07.608
- So you climbed down a chimney.
- Mm-hmm.

02:07.632 --> 02:08.788
Naturally. Of course you did.

02:08.812 --> 02:10.741
Covered in soot, shot at...

02:11.381 --> 02:12.831
but it worked.

02:12.855 --> 02:15.749
- Seven arrests.
- All in a day's work.

02:15.773 --> 02:17.052
Yeah, when you're FBI.

02:17.076 --> 02:20.314
Hmm. So how's your conference?
A-Are you speaking?

02:20.339 --> 02:22.039
Or are you just attending? I'm speaking.

02:22.063 --> 02:23.259
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

02:23.283 --> 02:25.479
"Sexual Sadism in Serial Killers."

02:26.582 --> 02:28.173
Fun weekend, right?

02:29.107 --> 02:32.956
I'm gonna need a big run
after this session.

02:32.980 --> 02:35.654
It's how I get out of my head
when work gets too dark.

02:35.678 --> 02:37.395
There are some great
running paths in the city.

02:37.419 --> 02:39.851
Oh, yeah? It's my first time here.

02:41.946 --> 02:43.686
I could use a tour guide.

02:46.817 --> 02:48.711
Okay, note to self:

02:48.735 --> 02:50.104
Beaumont's just not that into you.

02:50.128 --> 02:52.323
- Oh, I didn't mean to...
- No, it's fine.

02:52.347 --> 02:54.891
We worked together,
professional chemistry was good.

02:54.915 --> 02:57.079
Thought I'd see
if it was good in other areas.

02:57.103 --> 02:59.591
It wasn't a proposal. We're fine.

02:59.615 --> 03:00.878
- Drink your beer.
- Okay.

03:03.619 --> 03:06.577
So what's your thing when you've got

03:07.245 --> 03:08.731
a messed up case you can't shake?

03:08.755 --> 03:10.254
How do you handle the stress?

03:10.716 --> 03:12.039
I've learned to deal with it.

03:12.063 --> 03:13.954
I, um, compartmentalize well.

03:13.978 --> 03:15.433
Hmm.

03:15.946 --> 03:16.993
Sorry.

03:20.483 --> 03:22.136
Uh...

03:22.160 --> 03:24.138
- Duty calls. I'll get the check.
- Yeah, I get it.

03:24.162 --> 03:25.879
No, please.

03:25.903 --> 03:27.085
My treat.

03:27.109 --> 03:28.601
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:41.744 --> 03:43.810
Here, here's your proof of life.

03:47.663 --> 03:50.205
Thank you for sending that.
Now we can move forward.

03:50.689 --> 03:52.601
If you promise
that Gabriel won't be hurt,

03:52.625 --> 03:54.298
his parents are willing to pay.

03:54.634 --> 03:56.648
I don't want to hurt him.

03:56.672 --> 03:58.219
Well, we appreciate that.

03:58.243 --> 03:59.826
What is it that you do want?

04:00.098 --> 04:01.610
Do you have a pen?

04:01.634 --> 04:03.653
I want you to get this exactly right.

04:03.677 --> 04:04.853
Give me a second.

04:06.256 --> 04:08.491
Tone's up, anxiety's down.

04:08.515 --> 04:10.140
This guy likes getting down to business.

04:10.164 --> 04:12.621
Okay, yeah. I got one.

04:12.645 --> 04:16.391
I want $282,000 in $50 bills

04:16.415 --> 04:19.216
in a black carry-on size suitcase.

04:21.870 --> 04:23.719
What's up?

04:23.743 --> 04:25.634
Pull up the file. Check the voice print.

04:26.322 --> 04:27.648
You know, that's, uh,

04:27.672 --> 04:29.290
that's an awfully specific number.

04:29.314 --> 04:30.458
Any special reason?

04:30.482 --> 04:32.902
It doesn't matter to you.
Get it together.

04:32.926 --> 04:34.425
I'll call back in eight hours.

04:36.669 --> 04:38.163
- What are you looking up?
- What is going on?

04:38.187 --> 04:39.513
One second, please.

04:39.830 --> 04:42.460
I want $282,000.

04:42.485 --> 04:44.551
Get it in $50 bills and put it in

04:44.576 --> 04:47.119
- a black carry-on size suitcase.
- Amazing.

04:48.497 --> 04:49.773
The voice print matches.

04:52.076 --> 04:53.512
He's back.

04:55.443 --> 04:56.926
Uh, the voice that you just heard

04:56.950 --> 04:58.754
was from a, a separate recording.

04:58.778 --> 05:00.351
Six years ago.

05:00.375 --> 05:02.366
We've dealt with this kidnapper before.

05:02.390 --> 05:04.381
- Did you get the kid back?
- Absolutely, we did.

05:04.405 --> 05:06.829
- Okay.
- And what are you afraid to tell us?

05:08.417 --> 05:10.287
The kidnapper mutilated the boy.

05:10.710 --> 05:12.550
Cut off his finger.

05:29.786 --> 05:37.793
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

05:38.480 --> 05:40.390
Same victim profile as the previous case?

05:40.414 --> 05:43.722
- Another boy. Also ten years old.
- You made a deal?

05:44.902 --> 05:47.257
After the money drop,
we were waiting for word.

05:47.282 --> 05:49.347
Then the doorbell rang,
and he was just standing there

05:49.371 --> 05:52.872
with his missing finger. Hand bandaged.

05:52.896 --> 05:54.918
He'd been dropped off
at the end of his street.

05:54.942 --> 05:56.746
Why did I let myself get so distracted?

05:56.770 --> 05:58.518
How stupid was that?

05:58.542 --> 06:00.934
A man walked right by me.
Why didn't that worry me?

06:00.958 --> 06:02.621
It is not your fault.

06:02.645 --> 06:04.231
It's theirs.

06:04.805 --> 06:06.200
Why didn't you catch this guy?

06:06.224 --> 06:08.071
Because the deal I made
to get the boy back

06:08.095 --> 06:09.899
meant letting the kidnapper go.

06:09.923 --> 06:11.335
I'm sorry, how's that?

06:11.980 --> 06:14.208
I have one focus when I'm on a job.

06:14.691 --> 06:16.906
Save the victim.

06:17.402 --> 06:19.822
To do the work that I do,
I-I have to prioritize

06:19.846 --> 06:22.159
saving lives over catching criminals.

06:22.699 --> 06:24.609
I create trust.

06:24.633 --> 06:26.524
Sometimes with awful people
and I follow through

06:26.548 --> 06:29.701
because it means bringing
innocent victims home safely.

06:29.725 --> 06:31.074
So you let them go?

06:31.098 --> 06:32.748
I know you need
someone to blame right now.

06:32.772 --> 06:35.272
But I promise you,
what you want is a negotiator

06:35.296 --> 06:37.057
who will put Gabriel's safety

06:37.081 --> 06:38.362
above everything else.

06:38.386 --> 06:40.432
Including catching his kidnapper.

06:42.477 --> 06:44.586
I believe I can
bring him home in one piece

06:44.610 --> 06:46.133
if you'll work with me.

06:55.815 --> 06:57.579
So, what's the plan?

06:58.841 --> 07:00.863
We need to build a
profile of the kidnapper

07:00.887 --> 07:02.504
from the previous case and this one.

07:02.528 --> 07:04.475
Zara, I want you and Oliver

07:04.499 --> 07:06.086
to go check out the grocery store.

07:06.110 --> 07:07.391
You think he was following them?

07:07.415 --> 07:09.828
Maybe. Find out what you can without

07:09.852 --> 07:11.213
tipping anyone off that
there was a kidnapping.

07:11.237 --> 07:13.354
- Okay?
- All right.

07:13.378 --> 07:15.138
What about us?

07:15.162 --> 07:17.706
We're gonna go see
Tommy and Molly Parker.

07:17.730 --> 07:19.229
The first victim and his mother.

07:19.253 --> 07:21.275
Tommy might be able
to give us some insight into

07:21.299 --> 07:22.841
who we're dealing with to strengthen

07:22.865 --> 07:24.199
our position when the
kidnapper calls back.

07:24.223 --> 07:25.789
- Okay.
- It's a bit of a drive.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.368
We'll be back before the next call.

07:27.392 --> 07:28.804
Did you ever figure out why

07:28.828 --> 07:30.501
the kidnapper took Tommy's finger?

07:30.525 --> 07:33.461
We were never sure. It wasn't sadistic.

07:33.485 --> 07:35.637
Tommy was unconscious
during the amputation.

07:35.661 --> 07:37.440
Was it an intimidation tactic?

07:37.464 --> 07:39.014
No, no.

07:39.038 --> 07:40.474
It could have been a
trophy or a punishment.

07:40.475 --> 07:42.018
I don't know.

07:42.042 --> 07:43.193
We have eight hours to find out.

07:43.217 --> 07:45.198
Gabriel's not coming home mutilated.

07:50.181 --> 07:53.097
Hmm. There's some kind
of adhesive in there.

07:54.576 --> 07:56.641
It's definitely rigged
to cause a distraction.

07:56.665 --> 07:58.015
Yeah.

08:00.017 --> 08:02.125
So, stating the obvious...

08:02.149 --> 08:03.779
this is a rough one.

08:03.803 --> 08:06.042
We've never dealt with
the same person twice.

08:06.066 --> 08:07.609
I knew someday it would happen.

08:07.633 --> 08:09.437
And I always figured I could handle it.

08:09.461 --> 08:10.640
But...

08:10.984 --> 08:13.049
a kidnapper who mutilates ten-year-olds?

08:13.073 --> 08:14.485
The difference between theory

08:14.509 --> 08:16.487
and practice is a feeling
in your stomach.

08:17.105 --> 08:19.055
I feel like I want to throw up.

08:19.079 --> 08:20.840
Well, our protocol is correct.

08:20.864 --> 08:22.363
We do what it takes to save lives.

08:22.387 --> 08:24.495
If we don't honor our
deals, people could die.

08:24.519 --> 08:25.975
Yeah, it doesn't make it easy.

08:25.999 --> 08:28.132
No. No, it doesn't.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.244
Hey, man. Uh, can I ask you something?

08:32.268 --> 08:34.505
Dude, we know it's broken.
We're working on it.

08:34.529 --> 08:36.291
Not the issue.

08:38.837 --> 08:40.860
My car got dinged in here yesterday.

08:40.884 --> 08:42.296
Did you see anybody loitering

08:42.320 --> 08:45.505
- around 4:00, 4:30?
- No, but you can file a report.

08:45.529 --> 08:48.650
Oh, no. That'll take too long.

08:49.372 --> 08:50.741
Look...

08:50.766 --> 08:52.724
the truth is...

08:53.505 --> 08:55.613
I'm pretty sure it was my crazy ex.

08:55.637 --> 08:59.182
If I could just get proof
that he smashed up my car,

08:59.206 --> 09:02.442
like the security tape or something,

09:02.993 --> 09:05.737
it would really help with
the restraining order.

09:06.867 --> 09:09.324
Okay, so there they are.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.978
There. There.

09:12.002 --> 09:13.022
- That guy?
- Yeah.

09:13.046 --> 09:15.111
He's been hovering around them.

09:15.538 --> 09:17.369
My manager's shift starts in ten minutes.

09:17.393 --> 09:19.202
- You need to be done.
- Come here.

09:19.994 --> 09:22.587
Have you seen this guy before?
In the red coat?

09:22.611 --> 09:24.650
Yeah, we hate that guy.

09:24.651 --> 09:26.940
For, like, three,
four weeks, he'd come in,

09:26.964 --> 09:29.284
same day, same time, and just hang out.

09:29.308 --> 09:31.504
And you said same day, same time?

09:31.528 --> 09:34.202
Yeah, uh, Fridays, 4:00-ish.

09:34.226 --> 09:36.351
You guys have two minutes, okay?

09:38.317 --> 09:40.295
Am I wrong, or did Anna say

09:40.319 --> 09:43.255
they go grocery shopping
around 4:00 on Fridays?

09:43.279 --> 09:45.170
Yeah, after school, for the weekend.

09:45.194 --> 09:46.519
So he was stalking them.

09:46.543 --> 09:48.042
Probably tampered with the pay station

09:48.066 --> 09:50.523
as they were checking out
and waited to take Gabriel.

09:50.547 --> 09:52.070
This wasn't random.

09:53.115 --> 09:54.377
This kid was targeted.

09:59.773 --> 10:02.230
You know I'll always be grateful
to you for bringing him home.

10:02.254 --> 10:03.840
But I...

10:03.864 --> 10:06.563
I don't think it's a good idea
to stir up his memories.

10:08.347 --> 10:09.542
He's still struggling.

10:10.301 --> 10:12.893
He barely eats, he barely sleeps.

10:13.513 --> 10:15.330
He won't talk about it.

10:15.354 --> 10:18.685
Six years of therapy
and he still has nightmares.

10:19.644 --> 10:21.467
I stepped away from him for all of

10:21.491 --> 10:26.539
ten seconds in that parking lot,
and it ruined his entire life.

10:30.447 --> 10:32.217
Tommy can help us ensure

10:32.241 --> 10:34.417
that what happened to him
doesn't happen again.

10:40.584 --> 10:42.020
Wait here.

10:48.996 --> 10:52.237
Eric, does Tommy have a brother?

10:52.261 --> 10:53.845
He did.

10:55.118 --> 10:56.685
His twin passed away.

10:57.731 --> 10:59.726
This family's been through a lot.

11:07.319 --> 11:09.341
I asked you to turn that off.

11:09.365 --> 11:11.802
No, it's okay. Let him play. It's fine.

11:27.252 --> 11:28.949
Everybody does that.

11:30.734 --> 11:32.150
I'm sorry, um...

11:32.174 --> 11:34.409
I'm Eric Beaumont. This is my colleague,

11:34.433 --> 11:36.596
Cynthia Walker. Do you remember me?

11:39.656 --> 11:42.287
Yeah. Kind of.

11:42.311 --> 11:44.748
Your mom told you another boy
has been kidnapped?

11:47.011 --> 11:50.362
Do you mind telling us
what the kidnapper was like?

11:57.282 --> 11:58.743
He was friendly.

11:59.980 --> 12:01.496
We played video games.

12:02.705 --> 12:04.265
Were they violent games?

12:04.289 --> 12:05.959
No.

12:06.378 --> 12:07.961
He was old-school.

12:08.380 --> 12:10.706
Saving princesses, collecting coins.

12:11.631 --> 12:13.803
He got mad when he couldn't
get all the coins.

12:14.939 --> 12:16.928
Was that the only time he got mad?

12:18.303 --> 12:19.806
No.

12:20.094 --> 12:22.934
I moved a chair closer to the TV.

12:23.308 --> 12:25.721
He yelled, told me not to move anything.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.226
Was that right before he hurt you?

12:30.365 --> 12:32.212
No, he calmed down.

12:32.861 --> 12:34.904
He was in a good mood.

12:34.928 --> 12:38.323
Then he left for a while.

12:42.286 --> 12:44.245
Came back with a strawberry milkshake.

12:46.679 --> 12:48.126
What happened next?

12:48.741 --> 12:50.328
I don't know.

12:50.353 --> 12:51.838
I felt sleepy.

12:53.256 --> 12:54.948
Then I woke up.

12:57.299 --> 12:59.095
I felt how bad it hurt.

12:59.562 --> 13:01.472
I looked down, and...

13:05.007 --> 13:07.594
He was in a good mood before
he went for the milkshake,

13:07.619 --> 13:10.032
so we can rule out the idea
that he was punishing Tommy.

13:10.616 --> 13:12.768
Trophy theory might still work.

13:12.792 --> 13:16.032
The wound was properly treated. What?

13:16.056 --> 13:19.046
I don't understand how you're
so matter-of-fact about this.

13:19.070 --> 13:20.820
I have to be matter-of-fact about this.

13:20.844 --> 13:23.301
If I start doubting my choices,
I'm no good to Gabriel.

13:23.325 --> 13:25.580
- Can I say something?
- Course.

13:26.066 --> 13:27.609
We can't let this guy go again.

13:27.633 --> 13:29.742
We do whatever we have to do
to save Gabriel.

13:29.766 --> 13:32.005
We're talking about
a violent serial offender

13:32.029 --> 13:34.094
- who targets children.
- It's hard,

13:34.118 --> 13:35.443
and probably harder for you...

13:35.467 --> 13:36.966
- For me?
- You're new.

13:36.990 --> 13:38.403
Our policies are still theoretical.

13:38.427 --> 13:40.239
Right, so maybe that means
I have fresh eyes.

13:40.263 --> 13:42.363
You do, and sometimes that's valuable,

13:42.387 --> 13:44.891
but right now, I need you
to trust me, okay?

13:48.611 --> 13:50.066
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:50.090 --> 13:51.747
- You found something?
- A couple of things.

13:51.771 --> 13:54.324
First off, Gabriel wasn't
a random victim.

13:54.348 --> 13:57.044
The kidnapper was stalking him at
that store every Friday.

13:57.068 --> 13:58.792
- He was targeted.
- What's your read?

13:58.816 --> 14:00.219
- He's a planner.
- Mm-hmm.

14:00.243 --> 14:02.731
Patient, meticulous, self-disciplined.

14:02.755 --> 14:04.385
20 minutes till he calls back.

14:04.409 --> 14:06.535
You guys keep on the CCTV.
I'm gonna talk to the parents.

14:06.559 --> 14:08.665
If these kids are being
targeted, figuring out

14:08.689 --> 14:11.087
what connects them might tell us
what's driving this guy.

14:11.111 --> 14:12.627
Yeah.

14:13.244 --> 14:14.571
What about extracurriculars?

14:14.572 --> 14:16.202
Is Gabriel enrolled in any programs?

14:16.226 --> 14:19.423
Soccer. He has two left feet.

14:19.447 --> 14:21.251
He, um...

14:21.275 --> 14:22.948
Plays basketball, too.
He's better at that.

14:22.972 --> 14:24.645
Was the other boy sporty?

14:24.669 --> 14:26.038
Tommy was more of an introvert.

14:26.062 --> 14:27.431
Uh, when's Gabriel's birthday?

14:27.455 --> 14:29.172
- October 15.
- I'm sorry,

14:29.196 --> 14:31.435
how long are we supposed to play
20 Questions?

14:31.459 --> 14:33.002
Is any of this actually helping?

14:33.026 --> 14:36.222
Okay. Let's, uh, let's come
at this the other way.

14:36.246 --> 14:38.746
Unique things about the
previous victim, Tommy.

14:38.770 --> 14:40.183
Life-threatening allergies?

14:40.207 --> 14:43.055
- No.
- Exceptionally high IQ?

14:43.079 --> 14:46.189
No. I mean, he's bright, but he's normal.

14:46.213 --> 14:47.762
I don't suppose Gabriel had a twin?

14:48.371 --> 14:49.801
He was supposed to.

14:50.248 --> 14:52.262
Our other baby died in utero.

14:53.176 --> 14:54.675
T-minus 30 seconds to the call.

14:55.420 --> 14:57.296
Um, will you excuse me?

14:59.791 --> 15:01.944
I think I got something.

15:01.968 --> 15:03.554
Both kids lost a twin.

15:03.578 --> 15:05.469
- What does that mean?
- I don't know, but...

15:06.755 --> 15:09.934
I guess we can add punctual
to the profile.

15:12.456 --> 15:14.043
Thanks for calling back.

15:14.067 --> 15:15.630
Do you have the exact amount?

15:15.654 --> 15:19.744
We do. $282,000.

15:19.768 --> 15:22.268
Drive to Creek Road alone at 8:00 p.m.

15:22.292 --> 15:24.183
There's a sign covered in graffiti

15:24.207 --> 15:25.663
five kilometers east of Ridge Lane.

15:25.687 --> 15:28.709
Leave the money, or the kid dies.

15:28.733 --> 15:30.450
All right, first, we need to talk.

15:30.474 --> 15:32.061
We never got properly introduced.

15:32.085 --> 15:33.916
My name is Eric Beaumont.

15:34.565 --> 15:36.567
We crossed paths six years ago.

15:39.048 --> 15:42.027
I remember.
You followed instructions well.

15:42.051 --> 15:43.905
And we'll do the same again.

15:43.929 --> 15:46.336
Good. I like a man of his word.

15:46.360 --> 15:48.431
We need you to promise us something.

15:49.232 --> 15:51.142
We're gonna give you your money,

15:51.843 --> 15:53.778
but you have to guarantee us
that, this time,

15:53.802 --> 15:55.646
the boy comes home in one piece.

16:00.651 --> 16:02.202
Do we have a deal?

16:07.335 --> 16:08.989
It's not up to me.

16:17.542 --> 16:19.346
"It's not up to me"?

16:19.370 --> 16:21.225
Maybe he has an accomplice?

16:21.225 --> 16:23.159
If he does, the other guy's
the decision maker.

16:23.183 --> 16:25.134
Wait a second.

16:28.406 --> 16:31.428
He keeps looking behind him on the video.

16:31.452 --> 16:33.430
It's possible he's exchanging
looks with someone.

16:33.454 --> 16:34.866
If there are two suspects,

16:34.890 --> 16:36.390
we need to speak to the one in charge.

16:36.414 --> 16:38.566
I have a friend in the RCMP.

16:38.590 --> 16:40.350
She's local. She might be able to help.

16:40.374 --> 16:42.441
Okay. Great. Talk to her off the record.

16:42.465 --> 16:45.034
Find out if there are other cases,
and if any involve two suspects

16:45.058 --> 16:46.427
working together. You two,

16:46.451 --> 16:48.837
go to the hospital
where Gabriel was born.

16:48.861 --> 16:51.927
See if anyone there recognizes
the guy from the grocery store.

16:51.951 --> 16:53.320
Only family and medical personnel

16:53.344 --> 16:55.626
would know about the twin
who died in utero.

16:55.650 --> 16:58.793
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm going for a run.

17:07.227 --> 17:09.204
- Nothing, huh?
- No.

17:09.229 --> 17:11.710
Okay. Thank you. Welcome.

17:12.798 --> 17:14.558
Hey. Any luck on your floor?

17:14.582 --> 17:18.083
- Nothing.
- I'm striking out, too.

17:18.107 --> 17:20.521
Can we talk about the
elephant in the room?

17:20.545 --> 17:23.904
- That he went for a run?
- In the middle of a case.

17:23.928 --> 17:25.604
And I don't need to be a profiler

17:25.627 --> 17:27.231
to read his stress levels today.

17:27.255 --> 17:28.833
Yeah, well, heavy lies the crown.

17:28.857 --> 17:32.514
Wait a second. White male,
right height, might be him.

17:32.539 --> 17:34.779
Well, you said that about
the last guy, but yeah.

17:34.804 --> 17:36.153
It's worth a shot.

17:36.952 --> 17:38.887
Follow my lead.

17:38.911 --> 17:41.174
Zara... Za...

17:44.672 --> 17:46.606
Um, excuse me?

17:47.578 --> 17:48.955
Hi.

17:48.979 --> 17:50.739
Can I ask you a favor?

17:50.763 --> 17:55.352
My husband just got a clean
bill of health and...

17:55.808 --> 17:57.267
well, could you take our picture?

17:57.291 --> 17:58.617
I've been cleaning. I don't think

17:58.641 --> 18:00.053
you want me touching your phone.

18:00.077 --> 18:02.185
Oh, we have three kids.
Germs do not scare us.

18:02.209 --> 18:03.404
Germs galore.

18:05.735 --> 18:08.061
Okay. Cheese!

18:09.608 --> 18:12.200
Thank you! Thank you so much.

18:12.785 --> 18:13.936
Creepy.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.764
I knew this app would come in handy.

18:15.788 --> 18:18.506
Yeah, well, we still don't
know if that's our guy.

18:18.530 --> 18:20.706
I know how we can find out.

18:27.974 --> 18:30.282
Cynthia Walker, as I live and breathe.

18:30.306 --> 18:33.830
It's been a long time, Angela.

18:34.974 --> 18:36.961
- Oh, you look great.
- So do you.

18:36.985 --> 18:38.787
I'm sorry to reach out for a favor.

18:38.811 --> 18:41.224
Oh, please, do you have any idea

18:41.248 --> 18:44.184
how many classes you pulled me
through in school?

18:44.208 --> 18:45.383
I owe you one.

18:46.950 --> 18:49.450
Sorry I couldn't e-mail them.

18:49.474 --> 18:51.495
Didn't want to leave
a trace on the server.

18:51.519 --> 18:54.324
I appreciate you going the
extra mile. So what'd you find?

18:54.348 --> 18:56.544
- Four cases across Ontario.
- Four?

18:56.568 --> 18:59.808
Yeah. They were kept out of
the press because of copycats.

18:59.832 --> 19:02.375
- And all four lost a finger?
- Yeah.

19:02.966 --> 19:05.248
And you really think that
this guy is active again?

19:05.272 --> 19:06.423
We don't know, but we're doing

19:06.447 --> 19:09.059
as much research as we can on his M.O.

19:09.083 --> 19:10.427
In these four cases,

19:10.451 --> 19:12.473
was there any sign that there
was more than one kidnapper?

19:12.497 --> 19:13.692
Um, not that I read.

19:13.716 --> 19:15.215
RCMP working theory

19:15.239 --> 19:17.086
is that we're dealing
with a single operator.

19:18.182 --> 19:20.046
Okay. Well, thanks.

19:20.070 --> 19:22.352
- I appreciate it.
- Hey.

19:22.376 --> 19:24.616
If he's taken another child,
we want to know.

19:24.640 --> 19:26.691
We could help.

19:27.730 --> 19:30.428
Thanks, Angela. We'll talk soon.

19:44.834 --> 19:46.246
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:46.270 --> 19:48.910
- I got your message.
- Thanks for calling back.

19:48.934 --> 19:51.686
No problem. I just finished
the Sexual Sadism panel,

19:51.710 --> 19:54.341
and I'm about to run my legs off.

19:54.365 --> 19:56.691
I didn't think I'd hear from you again.

19:56.715 --> 19:59.172
I put your details through
our database and I got nothing.

19:59.682 --> 20:01.976
I don't think your guy
works cross-border.

20:02.768 --> 20:04.525
Oh, it was worth a shot.

20:05.146 --> 20:06.483
Are you okay?

20:06.507 --> 20:08.050
I'm running.

20:08.074 --> 20:11.663
Taking a page out of my book. Rough case?

20:14.777 --> 20:17.756
I did something six years ago
that's causing a lot of pain,

20:17.780 --> 20:19.583
and I might have to do it again.

20:20.661 --> 20:22.630
It's... making me question choices

20:22.654 --> 20:24.588
- I'm usually certain of.
- Yeah.

20:24.612 --> 20:26.373
Well, self-doubt sucks.

20:26.397 --> 20:28.865
- You up for advice?
- Sure. Absolutely.

20:28.896 --> 20:30.349
What I know is, when you've been doing

20:30.373 --> 20:34.294
this job for a while, all that
experience turns into instinct.

20:34.318 --> 20:36.083
Don't step on the crack,

20:36.107 --> 20:38.733
you'll break your mother's back.

20:38.757 --> 20:41.431
Step on the line,

20:41.455 --> 20:43.433
you'll break your mother's spine.

20:43.457 --> 20:46.480
So I'd say if you can't trust your mind,

20:46.504 --> 20:48.071
trust your gut.

20:49.115 --> 20:50.919
What are your instincts telling you?

20:50.943 --> 20:52.616
Thanks, Kate. I needed that.

20:52.640 --> 20:54.033
I got to go.

20:58.734 --> 21:00.929
I had a case years ago, before your time,

21:00.953 --> 21:05.373
with a guy who was terrified
of stepping on a subway grate.

21:06.190 --> 21:07.776
He was obsessive-compulsive.

21:08.134 --> 21:09.794
Here.

21:10.310 --> 21:11.853
He's constantly looking
at the ground behind him

21:11.877 --> 21:13.589
like he dropped something.

21:14.251 --> 21:15.901
You're right.
H-He's not looking at someone.

21:15.925 --> 21:18.182
It's-it's compulsive checking.

21:18.206 --> 21:19.687
Tommy also talked about
an irrational obsession

21:19.711 --> 21:21.297
with getting the coins in the game,

21:21.321 --> 21:23.909
and he said that he got mad
when he moved the furniture.

21:23.933 --> 21:25.737
Well, that definitely fits
the guy we just met.

21:25.761 --> 21:28.502
He was very concerned with germs.

21:30.459 --> 21:32.569
We think the kidnapper
is obsessive-compulsive.

21:32.942 --> 21:34.615
When he said "It's not up to me,"

21:34.639 --> 21:35.921
he meant it's up to the compulsion.

21:36.487 --> 21:38.155
There were four other kids.

21:39.031 --> 21:41.200
Every one of them lost a finger.

21:43.561 --> 21:45.582
This case happened after Tommy,

21:45.606 --> 21:46.888
and before Gabriel.

21:46.912 --> 21:48.585
There is a child out there

21:48.609 --> 21:50.196
who wouldn't have been mutilated

21:50.220 --> 21:52.396
if you'd called the police six years ago.

21:58.489 --> 21:59.814
I can't let this change anything.

21:59.838 --> 22:01.424
- Are you kidding me?
- I can't take

22:01.448 --> 22:03.419
an option off the table
that would save his life.

22:03.443 --> 22:05.777
No. No, what you can't do

22:05.801 --> 22:07.866
is accept the fact that maybe
you made the wrong call.

22:07.890 --> 22:09.650
- Okay, that's not fair.
- Not fair?

22:09.674 --> 22:11.826
Why don't you go see Tommy,
who still can't sleep at night,

22:11.850 --> 22:13.330
and ask him what's not fair?

22:14.374 --> 22:15.723
Hey.

22:16.722 --> 22:19.614
Um, the guy at the hospital,

22:19.639 --> 22:21.356
I ran his picture
through facial recognition

22:21.381 --> 22:23.925
and I got a name: Devin Atkins.

22:23.950 --> 22:25.841
I then went through the personnel
listing at the hospital

22:25.866 --> 22:27.713
where Tommy Parker's twin died.

22:27.738 --> 22:28.872
He worked there.

22:29.999 --> 22:31.498
That connects them. He's our guy.

22:31.522 --> 22:34.240
That confirms he's targeting
boys with deceased twins.

22:34.264 --> 22:35.676
The question is why.

22:35.700 --> 22:37.286
Eric, we have a name.

22:37.310 --> 22:38.984
The police can get to him in minutes.

22:39.008 --> 22:41.769
Anything goes wrong
and the kidnapper kills Gabriel.

22:41.793 --> 22:43.767
We can't keep arguing.
The ransom drop is in an hour.

22:43.791 --> 22:45.599
Do you know what else I read
in those reports?

22:45.623 --> 22:48.036
The kids said the kidnapper
came back with a suitcase

22:48.060 --> 22:49.646
right before he drugged them.

22:49.670 --> 22:52.693
Eric, he gets the ransom,
then he cuts off the finger.

22:52.717 --> 22:54.458
So paying the ransom is the trigger.

22:55.658 --> 22:58.506
If we pay, he cuts Gabriel's
finger off, and if we don't...

22:58.531 --> 23:00.064
Devin could follow
through with his threat.

23:00.089 --> 23:02.466
Yeah. And Gabriel dies.

23:04.903 --> 23:06.533
And you're sure?

23:06.557 --> 23:07.751
To get our son back alive,

23:07.775 --> 23:09.579
we have to let this sicko mutilate him?

23:09.603 --> 23:13.125
We've profiled this kidnapper
as obsessive-compulsive,

23:13.825 --> 23:16.337
which means he will do
the same thing each time.

23:16.915 --> 23:19.720
Getting the money,
then cutting off the finger,

23:19.744 --> 23:21.702
then releasing the victim.

23:35.189 --> 23:36.892
O-Okay.

23:40.765 --> 23:43.096
Pay the ransom.

23:50.744 --> 23:53.749
Hey. Hey.

23:55.646 --> 23:57.799
Okay. Take a beat.

23:57.823 --> 23:59.713
Take a breath.

24:00.129 --> 24:01.890
What did they say?

24:02.466 --> 24:06.503
They want us to pay the ransom,
but we're not doing that.

24:07.611 --> 24:09.725
Since when do we go
against the client's wishes?

24:09.955 --> 24:11.976
We'll go to the drop,
we'll bring the money,

24:12.000 --> 24:13.804
but we're not leaving it there

24:13.828 --> 24:16.764
and waiting for the kid to
come back permanently damaged.

24:16.788 --> 24:20.333
We don't know what he does
if his ritual gets interrupted.

24:20.357 --> 24:22.403
Compulsions are not rational.

24:23.838 --> 24:25.447
I'll take that risk.

24:27.581 --> 24:28.952
We have something.

24:28.976 --> 24:30.892
We got a hit on the twin angle.

24:30.916 --> 24:32.649
Devin lost his twin brother

24:32.673 --> 24:34.448
in a farming accident when he was ten.

24:34.472 --> 24:36.656
That childhood trauma is driving him.

24:36.656 --> 24:38.416
We should find a relative, get details.

24:38.440 --> 24:39.852
Way ahead of you.

24:39.876 --> 24:42.599
I got an address for
his father, Hank Atkins.

24:42.623 --> 24:43.726
All right, you two go to him.

24:43.750 --> 24:44.901
Get me something I can use before

24:44.925 --> 24:46.057
I go face-to-face with Devin, okay?

24:47.101 --> 24:49.645
We can't rule out an accomplice.

24:49.669 --> 24:50.820
We need eyes on the house.

24:50.844 --> 24:52.846
- Okay. I'm on it.
- Cynthia.

24:54.891 --> 24:56.826
I need to know that you're with us.

24:56.850 --> 24:58.355
The truth?

24:58.852 --> 25:01.655
I'm standing here thinking
that if the police

25:01.679 --> 25:03.006
were to surround his place,

25:03.030 --> 25:06.424
get him into custody, this could
be over in a matter of minutes.

25:06.448 --> 25:08.240
Gabriel would be safe.

25:10.909 --> 25:13.843
I... um, I just wanted to let you
know that I made fresh coffee.

25:13.867 --> 25:15.453
That's great. We'll be right out.

25:15.477 --> 25:18.045
Would you just give us a minute, please?

25:25.080 --> 25:27.039
You know what I'mthinking?

25:28.548 --> 25:31.135
I'm thinking about
a 13-year-old named Hannah,

25:31.160 --> 25:34.685
whose kidnapper wanted all
of $20,000 and a getaway car.

25:36.759 --> 25:38.650
Her dad begged my FBI supervisor

25:38.674 --> 25:40.814
to walk away and let him pay.

25:41.242 --> 25:43.090
Instead, they knocked down the front door

25:43.114 --> 25:45.246
and Hannah got a bullet to the head.

25:47.292 --> 25:49.531
I'm thinking about a lot of Hannahs.

25:51.180 --> 25:52.868
Way too many.

25:54.951 --> 25:56.301
Yeah.

26:36.080 --> 26:37.730
It's almost 8:00.

26:37.754 --> 26:40.495
Well, hopefully, Eric can buy some time.

26:43.460 --> 26:45.108
Mr. Atkins?

26:45.132 --> 26:46.718
Not if you're selling something.

26:46.742 --> 26:47.937
I know your son,

26:47.961 --> 26:49.460
Devin.

26:49.484 --> 26:52.202
He's not doing so well, and
we're trying to help him out.

26:52.428 --> 26:55.075
So, what's wrong?

26:55.639 --> 26:57.275
Can we come in and talk?

27:08.982 --> 27:10.394
It's time.

27:10.418 --> 27:13.658
I'm outside Devin's house,
but nothing on this end. You?

27:13.682 --> 27:15.269
Nothing yet.

27:15.293 --> 27:16.729
Oh, hang on.

27:24.911 --> 27:26.671
False alarm.

27:26.695 --> 27:29.196
Something's not right.
This guy made the last call

27:29.220 --> 27:30.936
the exact second he said he would.

27:30.960 --> 27:32.808
Well, so where is he, then?

27:36.314 --> 27:37.900
Mr. Atkins, um,

27:37.924 --> 27:40.816
we're worried that Devin
hasn't fully recovered

27:40.840 --> 27:42.818
from losing his brother.

27:42.842 --> 27:45.081
Can you tell us what happened back then?

27:45.647 --> 27:47.431
That was two decades ago.

27:47.455 --> 27:51.372
True, but, um, trauma can linger.

27:53.244 --> 27:56.614
So, uh, how do you know Devin?

27:57.201 --> 27:59.203
That's a long story.

27:59.598 --> 28:01.358
You know, whiskey's my drink, too.

28:01.382 --> 28:02.968
Do you mind if I join you?

28:02.992 --> 28:06.866
Yeah, sure. Grab a glass.

28:19.183 --> 28:21.465
You know, I was pretty horrified to hear

28:21.489 --> 28:22.858
it was a farming accident.

28:23.268 --> 28:25.687
I've got three kids,
and I'm always telling them

28:25.711 --> 28:27.645
not to run out onto the street.

28:27.669 --> 28:30.866
But it must be a thousand times
harder on a farm.

28:30.890 --> 28:32.718
You have no idea.

28:34.435 --> 28:38.700
My ten-year-olds took
the tractor for a joyride.

28:41.335 --> 28:42.989
They knew better.

28:44.556 --> 28:46.534
Devin said it was an accident.

28:47.292 --> 28:49.086
"We hit a bump, Dad."

28:49.450 --> 28:51.844
Ben fell out of the bucket.

28:54.130 --> 28:59.199
And Devin... drove
straight over his rib cage.

28:59.223 --> 29:01.306
Oh, something's changed.

29:02.891 --> 29:05.811
H-He never made it to the hospital.

29:06.317 --> 29:08.208
And how did Devin handle that?

29:08.232 --> 29:09.606
How do you think?

29:10.408 --> 29:12.442
He fell apart.

29:12.761 --> 29:14.777
You weren't supposed to be here.

29:14.801 --> 29:16.955
You were supposed to
leave the money and go.

29:16.979 --> 29:19.001
All right, Devin? I'm Eric Beaumont.

29:19.025 --> 29:20.568
You can-you can put the gun down.

29:20.592 --> 29:21.917
Let's not do anything rash.

29:21.941 --> 29:23.962
- Where's my money?
- It's right here.

29:23.986 --> 29:25.583
It-it's in the car. But we need to talk.

29:25.607 --> 29:28.837
- That wasn't the deal.
- I can't let you hurt Gabriel.

29:28.861 --> 29:31.318
I don't think you want to, either.

29:31.342 --> 29:33.015
I know something happened
when you were just a boy...

29:33.039 --> 29:34.423
Shut up.

29:35.041 --> 29:37.019
You think you know me?

29:37.043 --> 29:39.045
Get the money.

29:40.089 --> 29:42.421
Okay.

29:42.445 --> 29:44.057
I could barely work.

29:44.711 --> 29:47.144
You know, it should have
been a good year, but, uh...

29:48.478 --> 29:50.491
we lost 300K.

29:54.365 --> 29:56.995
Well, I don't suppose that was 282,000,

29:57.019 --> 29:58.405
was it?

29:59.021 --> 30:03.118
Yeah, that, uh, that rings a bell.

30:03.765 --> 30:06.638
- How did you know?
- Wild guess.

30:11.033 --> 30:15.013
Well, anyway, we got through it.

30:15.037 --> 30:17.049
I made Devin atone,

30:18.258 --> 30:20.052
and we all moved on.

30:20.826 --> 30:23.195
What does "made him atone" mean?

30:23.219 --> 30:24.438
Oliver.

30:42.543 --> 30:44.993
Did you cut off his finger?

30:46.331 --> 30:48.622
Is that how you all moved on?

30:49.539 --> 30:50.957
You know...

30:52.553 --> 30:54.314
I think it's time

30:54.338 --> 30:57.515
for you people to leave.

30:59.511 --> 31:02.060
I know you lost someone
when you were a kid.

31:02.084 --> 31:03.192
Shut up.

31:03.216 --> 31:05.095
I know you need help.

31:05.119 --> 31:06.742
I said shut up!

31:06.766 --> 31:10.310
You have no idea what we need!

31:11.050 --> 31:12.051
We?

31:20.532 --> 31:22.888
Eric.

31:24.106 --> 31:28.110
Eric? Eric.

31:30.809 --> 31:32.787
He shot out my tires...

31:32.811 --> 31:35.355
and took the money.

31:35.379 --> 31:36.920
He's on his way to mutilate him.

31:48.706 --> 31:50.086
Are you okay?

31:50.110 --> 31:51.432
Yeah, I'm not worried about my head.

31:51.456 --> 31:52.632
Tell me what you got.

31:52.656 --> 31:54.862
Okay, I think Devin's got
a condition called

31:54.886 --> 31:56.630
"repetition compulsion."

31:56.654 --> 31:58.939
Sometimes compulsive people
repeat a major trauma

31:58.963 --> 32:00.737
over and over, reenacting it.

32:00.761 --> 32:03.071
Devin was driving the tractor
that accidentally killed

32:03.095 --> 32:04.121
his twin brother.

32:04.145 --> 32:05.514
His father blamed him for the death,

32:05.514 --> 32:06.882
cut off his finger to punish him,

32:06.906 --> 32:08.188
and told him that's how to move on.

32:08.212 --> 32:10.321
More evidence of repetition,
the family farm lost

32:10.345 --> 32:13.193
$282,000 that year,

32:13.217 --> 32:15.413
which Devin's father also blames him for.

32:15.437 --> 32:16.675
Same price as the ransom.

32:16.699 --> 32:19.330
So he's identifying with
the surviving twins.

32:19.354 --> 32:22.010
He's projecting his guilt onto other boys

32:22.034 --> 32:23.508
who've lost a twin.

32:23.532 --> 32:25.423
That's why he said that.

32:25.447 --> 32:29.296
He used the word, uh, "we,"
as in twins like himself.

32:29.320 --> 32:30.819
And he'll probably amputate their fingers

32:30.843 --> 32:32.256
in the same place it happened to him.

32:32.280 --> 32:33.342
The family farm.

32:33.366 --> 32:34.823
Cynthia.

32:34.847 --> 32:35.824
Are you okay?

32:35.848 --> 32:37.130
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

32:37.154 --> 32:38.305
Devin came and went.

32:38.329 --> 32:39.828
I'm following him along Bennett Road.

32:39.852 --> 32:41.073
That's not far from where we are.

32:41.097 --> 32:43.659
Okay, Cynthia,
stay with him, but hang back.

32:43.683 --> 32:46.400
We think he may be going to the
family farm. We're on our way.

33:25.463 --> 33:27.447
Can I go home soon?

33:30.555 --> 33:31.663
Very soon.

33:31.687 --> 33:33.665
After a sleep.

33:33.689 --> 33:36.213
Here, I bought you
this strawberry milkshake.

33:52.864 --> 33:55.364
I saw him go inside a minute ago.

33:55.841 --> 33:57.060
Okay.

33:57.871 --> 34:00.676
Wait. Do you want some backup in there?

34:01.066 --> 34:03.859
It's probably better that
I talk to him one-on-one.

34:09.551 --> 34:11.442
- Get out!
- I can't... I...

34:11.466 --> 34:13.268
I can't do that, Devin.

34:13.293 --> 34:14.487
I know you think you're helping

34:14.512 --> 34:15.837
these twins to move on, but you're not.

34:15.860 --> 34:17.665
I'm doing this forhim.

34:17.688 --> 34:18.971
Remember Tommy Parker?

34:19.541 --> 34:21.824
You didn't help him, Devin.

34:23.134 --> 34:25.156
He never blamed himself
for his brother's death.

34:25.181 --> 34:28.246
He wasn't suffering for that,
but he is suffering now.

34:28.570 --> 34:31.052
He's traumatized from being mutilated.

34:31.902 --> 34:32.966
And so are you.

34:33.183 --> 34:35.379
I know your father blamed you.

34:35.402 --> 34:38.382
Made you atone by
cutting off your finger.

34:38.976 --> 34:41.239
But I had to atone.

34:41.264 --> 34:43.690
No, your father was wrong.

34:43.715 --> 34:45.344
You were two boys playing.

34:45.369 --> 34:48.092
It was... it was a horrible accident,

34:48.117 --> 34:51.375
but you were an innocent boy,
just like Gabriel here.

34:54.509 --> 34:56.011
I'm not innocent now.

34:56.034 --> 34:57.704
But you can atone now...

34:58.251 --> 35:00.055
by letting Gabriel go,

35:00.079 --> 35:01.833
and turning yourself in.

35:02.386 --> 35:03.494
I feel weird.

35:03.518 --> 35:04.997
- Okay...
- Stop!

35:07.005 --> 35:08.993
Devin, you know I'm not gonna
let you do this.

35:09.017 --> 35:10.373
I don't want to kill you.

35:10.397 --> 35:12.459
You've never killed anyone.
You don't want to start now.

35:12.483 --> 35:14.616
But I will do it.

35:15.928 --> 35:19.125
What if you didn't have
to turn yourself in? Huh?

35:19.150 --> 35:21.227
What if I let you walk away from here?

35:23.668 --> 35:24.773
I can't.

35:25.997 --> 35:27.442
It's in my head.

35:28.580 --> 35:30.602
- I need to finish this.
- No, you don't.

35:30.627 --> 35:32.605
To cut off his finger,
you're gonna have to kill me.

35:32.630 --> 35:34.172
That's not a part of your compulsion.

35:34.374 --> 35:36.440
The pattern's already broken, Devin.

35:36.464 --> 35:38.291
You can still walk away from this.

35:49.912 --> 35:51.542
Yes, sir.

35:51.566 --> 35:53.326
What did you do?

35:53.350 --> 35:55.546
It wasn't me. I didn't call them.

35:55.570 --> 35:56.875
This is not good.

35:59.940 --> 36:02.422
- Hey...
- What did you do?!

36:02.446 --> 36:03.554
It's not me.

36:03.578 --> 36:05.773
Make them go, or I'll kill him.

36:05.797 --> 36:08.733
Roger that.

36:09.346 --> 36:12.151
Captain, please, our negotiator
needs more time in there.

36:12.176 --> 36:13.458
The man in there is mentally ill.

36:13.483 --> 36:14.721
He doesn't want to hurt anybody.

36:14.746 --> 36:17.217
Shooting him should be
an absolute last resort.

36:17.242 --> 36:19.699
It always is, but we are here
to get that boy out alive.

36:19.724 --> 36:22.920
Have you got the kidnapper's
phone number yet?

36:22.945 --> 36:24.704
You said you'd get me out of here!

36:24.729 --> 36:26.011
Yeah, but it's too late for that.

36:26.035 --> 36:27.447
But you put down that gun,
I will do everything

36:27.471 --> 36:29.841
I can to help you get into
a psychiatric facility,

36:29.865 --> 36:32.841
where you can be a patient
rather than a prisoner.

36:33.197 --> 36:35.025
Doctors can help you.

36:38.811 --> 36:40.659
Line of sight clear.Hold.

36:40.684 --> 36:43.208
Only fire on sudden movement.

36:47.186 --> 36:49.164
- Go around the back.
- You, too. Ready?

36:49.188 --> 36:51.396
I didn't mean to make this worse.

36:51.421 --> 36:53.747
I gave them Devin Atkins' name.

36:53.772 --> 36:55.880
It's just, I-I heard you talking about

36:55.905 --> 36:58.116
how easily this could all be over.

36:59.109 --> 37:01.522
I thought that they
would just arrest him.

37:01.547 --> 37:02.916
You really think it can get better?

37:02.941 --> 37:04.483
I do, but you need to put down the gun.

37:04.507 --> 37:06.190
Don't take a step, don't toss it,

37:06.214 --> 37:08.381
don't make any big moves. Just drop it.

37:12.736 --> 37:14.189
No, don't!

38:20.584 --> 38:22.475
Hey.

38:22.499 --> 38:24.545
Are you okay?

38:24.569 --> 38:26.479
Yeah.

38:26.503 --> 38:28.164
Just one of those days.

38:28.189 --> 38:29.886
Yeah, I hear you.

38:36.513 --> 38:38.643
I just need to confer with
my team, if you don't mind.

38:38.667 --> 38:39.843
Copy that.

38:40.822 --> 38:42.350
What did they say?

38:42.375 --> 38:46.349
No guarantees, but they think
Gabriel's gonna be okay.

38:47.071 --> 38:48.222
A few inches to the right,

38:48.247 --> 38:49.901
and that bullet would have
killed him, too.

38:52.065 --> 38:53.719
Yeah.

39:13.940 --> 39:17.137
The ER doctors confirmed
what the paramedics said.

39:17.641 --> 39:19.687
Gabriel's gonna recover.

39:20.605 --> 39:22.594
Thank God for that.

39:25.459 --> 39:27.627
The parents told me they made the call

39:27.651 --> 39:29.585
because they overheard us arguing.

39:30.101 --> 39:31.587
I'm sorry.

39:31.611 --> 39:33.521
That's on me.

39:33.546 --> 39:35.200
It's on both of us.

39:37.130 --> 39:39.263
No one had to get hurt tonight.

39:40.650 --> 39:42.976
Devin didn't need to die.

39:43.233 --> 39:44.863
We got lucky with Gabriel.

39:44.888 --> 39:46.292
I see that.

39:46.317 --> 39:47.744
Do you?

39:48.585 --> 39:52.086
I need to understand that
you know why we do what we do.

39:52.110 --> 39:55.766
Even if it means letting
someone like Devin walk away.

39:57.559 --> 40:00.268
Look, Eric, after what happened tonight,

40:00.292 --> 40:04.688
I... I get it. I'm with you.

40:07.355 --> 40:09.182
Good.

40:14.132 --> 40:16.147
Can I ask you something?

40:16.172 --> 40:18.783
Does it ever get any easier?

40:22.487 --> 40:24.577
Yeah, I didn't think so.

40:48.789 --> 40:50.318
Hey.

40:50.342 --> 40:52.668
- Hey.
- Glad you're still in town.

40:52.692 --> 40:55.739
Your advice really helped,
and I-I wanted to thank you.

40:59.929 --> 41:01.167
Can we get real for a second?

41:01.192 --> 41:03.518
'Cause I'm getting
a little whiplash over here.

41:03.543 --> 41:06.435
First you said yes when
I asked you out Friday night,

41:06.460 --> 41:09.091
only to seem uninterested.

41:09.116 --> 41:11.529
Then you reached out to me and opened up.

41:11.554 --> 41:13.520
Now you called
and asked me out for drinks,

41:13.545 --> 41:16.884
but you just want to say thank you.

41:16.909 --> 41:18.974
I didn't say "just."

41:18.999 --> 41:20.324
Oh.

41:20.349 --> 41:22.952
I'm better at work than I am at this.

41:24.977 --> 41:27.521
So, facing off with violent
criminals is your comfort zone.

41:28.678 --> 41:31.055
It's not something I lead with, but...

41:31.079 --> 41:33.337
If this is you doing that thing
where you lay the foundation

41:33.337 --> 41:34.706
so you can say you warned me later...

41:34.730 --> 41:36.316
No, this is me realizing
I'm glad I've got a lot

41:36.340 --> 41:38.580
of travel points, and saying next time,

41:38.604 --> 41:41.321
- I can do the traveling.
- Hmm.

41:41.345 --> 41:43.541
If you're up for it.

41:44.444 --> 41:46.326
What are your instincts telling you?
