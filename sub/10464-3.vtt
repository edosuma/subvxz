WEBVTT

00:02.419 --> 00:04.304
Oh, I'll see you guys later.

00:05.839 --> 00:08.057
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:08.591 --> 00:10.778
You realize this school
has a Litter Society?

00:10.802 --> 00:12.562
Mm, for or against?

00:12.929 --> 00:14.063
Gum?

00:14.264 --> 00:15.282
Mm.

00:15.306 --> 00:17.525
- This is your last piece.
- It's okay.

00:23.273 --> 00:26.034
It says that they
meet on Mondays.

00:26.359 --> 00:29.714
Heal the Bay, is
Tuesdays and Thursdays.

00:29.738 --> 00:31.831
I might be able to swing
them both, unless...

00:32.031 --> 00:33.458
You think those are too similar?

00:33.783 --> 00:35.386
You're actually joining these?

00:35.410 --> 00:37.712
I mean, don't take this
the wrong way, but you?

00:37.829 --> 00:39.390
I gotta get more stuff
on my transcript,

00:39.414 --> 00:41.799
you know, activities, awards.

00:43.042 --> 00:44.437
Maybe I could save a life.

00:44.461 --> 00:45.595
You know? Um...

00:46.254 --> 00:48.139
I don't know, uh... uh...

00:48.423 --> 00:50.901
Uh, Heimlich someone in the
cafeteria or something.

00:50.925 --> 00:52.653
That would impress
colleges, don't you think?

00:52.677 --> 00:55.823
Yeah, well, if you're gonna ask me to
choke on a chicken bone during lunch,

00:55.847 --> 00:57.241
that's where I draw the line.

00:57.265 --> 00:58.691
Some friend you are.

00:58.850 --> 01:01.037
Class elections are coming
up, and you could run.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.862
Ah, that's a little geeky.

01:03.188 --> 01:04.331
Well, not on a transcript.

01:04.355 --> 01:06.250
And you'd win. I mean,
you'd definitely win.

01:06.274 --> 01:07.909
Who wouldn't vote for you?

01:08.526 --> 01:09.879
So, what, you mean,

01:09.903 --> 01:11.297
like president?

01:11.321 --> 01:13.632
Mm, Brian Cohen wins
that every year.

01:13.656 --> 01:15.009
How about vice president?

01:15.033 --> 01:16.459
Vice president?

01:16.576 --> 01:18.095
I can do that.

01:18.119 --> 01:19.754
And, and when you
think about it,

01:19.871 --> 01:22.840
what are the odds of the senior
class president dying in office?

01:24.167 --> 01:26.552
- Although with my luck...
- God, Bailey.

01:29.506 --> 01:31.516
You sure about this
chicken bone thing?

01:31.633 --> 01:33.277
- Definitely.
- Okay.

01:33.301 --> 01:35.269
- I'll see you.
- Bye.

01:38.473 --> 01:40.858
All right, you guys,
meet me at my locker.

01:43.228 --> 01:44.737
Griffin.

01:45.647 --> 01:47.281
Hey, how's it goin'?

01:47.607 --> 01:50.118
All right. You?

01:52.529 --> 01:53.955
Um,

01:54.322 --> 01:57.583
Listen, about what
happened with us,

01:57.742 --> 01:59.136
it was nice and everything.

01:59.160 --> 02:02.389
I mean, I didn't not like
it, but there's Justin,

02:02.413 --> 02:04.715
and I love Justin.

02:05.208 --> 02:06.227
A lot.

02:06.251 --> 02:09.604
Um, and you and I could be
friends, like we've been.

02:09.628 --> 02:11.440
I mean, I still want us to,

02:11.464 --> 02:13.025
just nothing else.

02:13.049 --> 02:14.892
I mean, we can't
be anything more.

02:16.678 --> 02:18.020
Okay?

02:18.513 --> 02:20.064
I hear you.

02:20.223 --> 02:21.566
Good.

02:22.058 --> 02:23.609
Good. Okay.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.955
Um, so I should go to French.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.289
Yeah, right.

02:27.313 --> 02:28.948
So I'll see you sometime.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.534
- Hey.
- Yeah?

There's Monica and
Phil, Greg and Carol,

03:34.797 --> 03:36.817
and Robin and Steve are a yes,

03:36.841 --> 03:39.060
so that makes pretty much
the whole Berkeley gang.

03:39.302 --> 03:40.487
It'll be cool to see everybody.

03:40.511 --> 03:41.739
You know, they still
can't believe

03:41.763 --> 03:44.116
that bachelor No. 1,
Charlie Salinger,

03:44.140 --> 03:45.492
is actually getting married.

03:45.516 --> 03:46.776
Well, I believe it.

03:46.976 --> 03:47.912
I can't wait.

03:47.936 --> 03:50.497
Mm. I'm speaking to
Joe about food later.

03:50.521 --> 03:51.739
Any special requests?

03:52.899 --> 03:54.158
I love this guy.

03:54.275 --> 03:56.253
He's throwing you and
Kirsten an engagement party

03:56.277 --> 03:58.088
at our house, catered
by our restaurant.

03:58.112 --> 03:59.956
What kind of best
friend are you, anyway?

04:00.114 --> 04:01.091
Just for that, missy,

04:01.115 --> 04:02.343
see if you get a party out of me

04:02.367 --> 04:04.293
when you and Justin get hitched.

04:04.327 --> 04:05.920
I'm outta here. Walking? Riding?

04:09.624 --> 04:11.968
That woman! She's... I...

04:12.460 --> 04:14.136
Oh, God! I just wanted to...

04:15.255 --> 04:16.815
Kirsten, what are
you doing here?

04:16.839 --> 04:19.485
Your flight isn't supposed to
arrive for another six hours.

04:19.509 --> 04:20.945
One hell of an
efficient airline.

04:20.969 --> 04:23.113
I mean, from the second
I got off the plane,

04:23.137 --> 04:24.907
not, "Hello, nice to see you."

04:24.931 --> 04:26.116
No! No, no, no.

04:26.140 --> 04:28.859
It was, "You can't have
gladiolus in your bouquet."

04:29.602 --> 04:31.612
Why? Is that against the law?

04:31.729 --> 04:33.990
And, "Darling,

04:34.190 --> 04:36.033
not a jazz ensemble."

04:36.276 --> 04:38.545
Uh, I mean, what a
moron I must be.

04:38.569 --> 04:40.965
But I said, "Fine.
It's your nickel."

04:40.989 --> 04:43.092
Then we're at the
bridal boutique,

04:43.116 --> 04:44.375
and every dress I try on,

04:44.617 --> 04:45.844
she doesn't like the train,

04:45.868 --> 04:47.795
or it's too low-cut.

04:47.954 --> 04:50.923
I think "slutty" was the actual
word she used for one of them.

04:51.040 --> 04:53.811
Then I put this gown on.
It's perfect.

04:53.835 --> 04:56.021
I love it. The
saleslady loves it.

04:56.045 --> 04:58.514
My mother looks me up
and down, and she says,

04:59.757 --> 05:01.309
"It's nice, dear,

05:01.759 --> 05:03.561
if you want to look
like a poodle."

05:04.762 --> 05:05.781
- Oh.
- Ouch.

05:05.805 --> 05:06.699
Woof.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.534
That was it. I got dressed.

05:08.558 --> 05:11.078
I got in a cab, and I
went straight to O'Hare.

05:11.102 --> 05:13.330
Will you call and ask them
to UPS my suitcase back?

05:13.354 --> 05:15.457
- My God, Kirsten, I...
- I don't want her input.

05:15.481 --> 05:16.834
I don't want her opinion.

05:16.858 --> 05:18.335
And they can keep their money.

05:18.359 --> 05:19.545
It's you and me now, Charlie.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.245
We are doing this ourselves.

05:21.529 --> 05:23.048
It's just like sometimes...

05:23.072 --> 05:25.092
I don't know what it is,

05:25.116 --> 05:28.085
but do you ever
feel, like, alone?

05:28.870 --> 05:30.296
Yeah, I do.

05:30.371 --> 05:32.465
And I guess that means
we're not alone, right?

05:32.999 --> 05:34.935
That's good, Paul. Now
try drawing Gail out

05:34.959 --> 05:37.104
about what specifically
is bothering her.

05:37.128 --> 05:39.815
Okay, so we're on the
roof of this car,

05:39.839 --> 05:42.099
and we're drinking tea.

05:42.216 --> 05:44.737
And then all of a sudden,
the cable snaps,

05:44.761 --> 05:47.448
and this thing starts careening
down Lombard Street.

05:47.472 --> 05:50.200
And everybody's screaming,
except for you.

05:50.224 --> 05:51.493
You keep saying,

05:51.517 --> 05:53.944
"I know you won't let
anything happen to me."

05:54.187 --> 05:57.124
And then the alarm
went off, I guess.

05:57.148 --> 05:59.418
Justin, come on. We need
to practice doing this.

05:59.442 --> 06:01.160
He's listening.

06:01.694 --> 06:04.590
Fine. And, uh,
here's my problem,

06:04.614 --> 06:06.957
Oh, anonymous hotline woman.

06:07.617 --> 06:09.219
I, uh, don't know what time

06:09.243 --> 06:11.128
to pick up my
girlfriend tonight.

06:11.245 --> 06:13.381
- Can you help me with that?
- Tonight?

06:14.290 --> 06:15.591
Oh, um...

06:15.666 --> 06:17.218
Wait. I can't.

06:18.878 --> 06:19.938
All right, you guys.

06:19.962 --> 06:21.806
You seem to be getting pretty
comfortable with this.

06:21.923 --> 06:23.150
Why not?

06:23.174 --> 06:25.319
Um, what's her name, Lynn,

06:25.343 --> 06:27.696
you know, the new salad
chopper or whatever she does,

06:27.720 --> 06:29.073
she asked me to fill in for her.

06:29.097 --> 06:31.575
It's people you know too. It's the
guy sitting next to you in English,

06:31.599 --> 06:33.118
the girl behind you in Math.

06:33.142 --> 06:34.244
They got problems.

06:34.268 --> 06:35.829
She's got stomach flu.

06:35.853 --> 06:38.114
And it pretty much comes
down to two words,

06:38.314 --> 06:39.949
trust and truth.

06:40.399 --> 06:42.368
You gotta get that
caller to trust you.

06:42.819 --> 06:45.297
But you're not gonna
do anybody any good

06:45.321 --> 06:47.123
if you're not telling the truth.

06:52.662 --> 06:56.391
Invitations, church,
banquet hall, clothing,

06:56.415 --> 06:59.468
caterer, bands,
flowers, photographer.

06:59.919 --> 07:01.063
Whoa.

07:01.087 --> 07:03.190
You guys better tell
people cash gifts only.

07:03.214 --> 07:04.733
- I think that's tacky.
- Yeah?

07:04.757 --> 07:08.195
Well, can you afford
$450 for flowers?

07:08.219 --> 07:09.321
You know, Kirsten,
I was thinking...

07:09.345 --> 07:11.115
Four-fifty for flowers?

07:11.139 --> 07:12.648
They're just gonna die.

07:12.807 --> 07:15.651
...maybe you'd want to get married
in our Mom's wedding dress.

07:15.685 --> 07:19.164
Mm, uh, well, I'm
sure it's lovely.

07:19.188 --> 07:22.334
- But I have a specific idea...
- Wait. I'll show you.

07:22.358 --> 07:24.294
Why don't you find somebody getting
married the day before you,

07:24.318 --> 07:25.921
and buy their flowers from them?

07:25.945 --> 07:28.247
It's not like anybody's gonna
know the difference, right?

07:28.322 --> 07:30.634
Bay, that is either the stupidest
thing I've ever heard,

07:30.658 --> 07:32.585
or you're really
on to something.

07:33.077 --> 07:34.763
- Huh?
- What?

07:34.787 --> 07:36.265
- You don't think that's...
- Here it is.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.684
Our grandmother got
married in it, and Mom,

07:38.708 --> 07:40.102
and Claud and I are gonna
get married in it.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.770
Kind of a family tradition.

07:41.794 --> 07:43.188
Well, it's your
family tradition.

07:43.212 --> 07:45.399
Well, aren't you
joining our family?

07:45.423 --> 07:46.483
Well, yeah, I...

07:46.507 --> 07:49.445
Not to mention the nine
to $1200 it would save.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.654
Wow!

07:50.678 --> 07:52.239
Kirsten, I've taken the liberty

07:52.263 --> 07:53.898
of highlighting some
China patterns.

07:53.973 --> 07:55.826
Or we can register
tomorrow, if you want.

07:55.850 --> 07:58.245
I think we're more the
paper-plate type.

07:58.269 --> 08:00.414
And besides, the breakfront
in the dining room

08:00.438 --> 08:03.500
is full of dishes, cups,
beautiful things.

08:03.524 --> 08:04.585
Yes, beautiful.

08:04.609 --> 08:07.254
But, uh, does the word
"dibs" mean anything to you?

08:07.278 --> 08:09.121
I really wish you'd
think about the dress.

08:09.405 --> 08:12.134
Uh, I'm thinking ix-nay
and filet mignon.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.927
Mm.

08:13.951 --> 08:15.721
Look, Macy's, 3:30.

08:15.745 --> 08:16.962
Be there.

08:19.081 --> 08:20.424
Ooh.

08:24.003 --> 08:26.023
- Hey.
- Oh, good evening, sir.

08:26.047 --> 08:28.066
I'm collecting money to
help subsidize nose jobs

08:28.090 --> 08:30.684
for some of the underprivileged
girls in our senior class.

08:33.429 --> 08:35.147
These are people's names?

08:35.972 --> 08:38.484
They're very nice names. Some
of them I even recognize.

08:38.558 --> 08:40.986
It's the signatures, you
need to be a candidate

08:41.229 --> 08:42.623
for vice president.

08:42.647 --> 08:43.916
Wait a second, you
didn't really...

08:43.940 --> 08:46.335
Bailey, look, it took, like,
ten minutes to get these.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.212
I mean, people love you.

08:48.236 --> 08:49.963
That was a dumb idea.
It was a dumb idea.

08:49.987 --> 08:51.173
I'd never even win.

08:51.197 --> 08:52.758
What do you wanna bet you would?

08:52.782 --> 08:54.760
- You wanna bet money?
- You're nuts.

08:54.784 --> 08:55.802
How about dinner and a movie?

08:55.826 --> 08:58.212
Dinner and a movie
says that you'll win.

09:00.998 --> 09:02.142
I don't even know anything

09:02.166 --> 09:03.268
about this
student-government stuff.

09:03.292 --> 09:04.937
So then I'll help you.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.647
I will. I'll manage
your campaign.

09:06.671 --> 09:09.014
I'll be the woman
behind the man.

09:10.591 --> 09:12.393
Come on. We'll do it together.

09:14.845 --> 09:16.272
Okay, I'm in.

09:16.305 --> 09:18.450
Great, you know,
there is tons to do.

09:18.474 --> 09:19.952
I mean, we have to come
up with a platform,

09:19.976 --> 09:21.537
write a speech, make posters.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.372
Well, you better get moving.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.916
Ha ha. Look, I'm free now.
Are you free?

09:25.940 --> 09:26.917
Uh, you know what? No.

09:26.941 --> 09:29.503
Tonight is a really bad night.
I got a ton of homework to do.

09:29.527 --> 09:31.630
- I better be going, then.
- Okay.

09:31.654 --> 09:33.163
So, we'll start tomorrow?

09:33.656 --> 09:35.008
Tomorrow.

09:35.032 --> 09:36.250
Okay.

09:37.034 --> 09:38.586
It's a date.

09:43.958 --> 09:46.135
Define "date".

09:46.836 --> 09:51.400
Eight Hundred
Sixty-Three, 864, 865...

09:51.424 --> 09:52.766
What are you doin'?

09:52.925 --> 09:54.861
I'm counting to a thousand.

09:54.885 --> 09:56.071
Ten didn't work.

09:56.095 --> 09:57.646
A hundred didn't work.

09:59.098 --> 10:00.733
What are you so steamed about?

10:01.267 --> 10:02.610
Them.

10:03.436 --> 10:04.695
Them who?

10:04.812 --> 10:05.747
Them who do you think?

10:05.771 --> 10:07.624
They're as bad as
my mother or worse.

10:07.648 --> 10:09.408
Because they had some
ideas about the wedding?

10:09.525 --> 10:11.169
Oh! Oh!

10:11.193 --> 10:12.870
You didn't hear Bailey's latest.

10:13.070 --> 10:15.414
He suggested we charge
people for parking.

10:15.489 --> 10:16.592
Charge them!

10:16.616 --> 10:18.552
I swear we're gonna have the
only reception in history

10:18.576 --> 10:20.637
with a $5 cover at the door!

10:20.661 --> 10:22.347
Kirsten, they're involved

10:22.371 --> 10:24.224
because they're happy
we're getting married.

10:24.248 --> 10:26.310
Isn't that better than if they
didn't want anything to do with it?

10:26.334 --> 10:27.593
No.

10:27.835 --> 10:29.094
Listen to me.

10:29.170 --> 10:31.106
I'm marrying you, not them.

10:31.130 --> 10:33.191
This is our wedding, not theirs.

10:33.215 --> 10:36.393
And I have to tell you, my mother
used up my very last nerve.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.488
I got her off my case, Charlie.

10:38.512 --> 10:39.781
Now it's your turn.

10:39.805 --> 10:42.409
Kirsten, I think you left your
perspective in Chicago or something.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.745
You are definitely
overreacting here.

10:44.769 --> 10:46.737
Fine. You think that?

10:46.812 --> 10:48.155
You're on the record.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.782
But you tell them,

10:49.857 --> 10:51.992
I am not planning our
wedding by committee.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.243
I mean it.

10:57.948 --> 10:59.333
Here you are.

10:59.950 --> 11:01.543
Thanks.

11:02.953 --> 11:08.018

11:14.507 --> 11:15.683
Hi.

11:16.550 --> 11:17.768
Hey.

11:18.260 --> 11:20.989
I would've ordered for you, but
I wasn't sure that you'd show.

11:21.013 --> 11:22.940
Yeah, neither was I.

11:24.934 --> 11:26.610
So, what do you want?

11:29.146 --> 11:31.073
Oh! Uh, I'm fine.

11:33.401 --> 11:34.669
It's kind of noisy tonight.

11:34.693 --> 11:36.620
Kind of stuffy too.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.593
It's nice outside,
lots of stars.

12:22.450 --> 12:23.844
What are you doing?

12:23.868 --> 12:27.463
You know, some of these
China patterns aren't bad.

12:27.663 --> 12:28.964
You wanna see?

12:29.165 --> 12:30.549
Sure.

12:31.709 --> 12:34.470
It's three in the morning,
what else do I have to do?

12:41.343 --> 12:43.145
You were right, Charlie.

12:43.762 --> 12:47.367
I guess I was still having
leftover mother anxiety,

12:47.391 --> 12:49.193
so when the kids
started jumping in,

12:49.268 --> 12:51.538
well, as we say in
the psych world,

12:51.562 --> 12:54.156
it was kind of a
conditioned response.

12:54.482 --> 12:55.709
But I know it's different.

12:55.733 --> 12:57.085
And I know they mean well.

12:57.109 --> 12:58.327
I told you.

12:58.861 --> 13:01.423
And anyhow, you and I have
final say about the wedding,

13:01.447 --> 13:02.924
so what harm could it do

13:02.948 --> 13:04.759
to let them feel like
it's theirs too?

13:04.783 --> 13:06.126
None at all.

13:08.579 --> 13:10.088
I hate those, by the way.

13:11.332 --> 13:12.716
Yeah, me too.

13:16.712 --> 13:19.264
How come all this
ritual matters so much?

13:20.549 --> 13:22.142
I don't know. It
does, doesn't it?

13:23.385 --> 13:25.437
Maybe it's an
excuse to show off.

13:26.305 --> 13:28.232
You get to say to
everybody, you know,

13:28.599 --> 13:30.776
"Look who I got.
Look who loves me."

13:31.810 --> 13:33.288
And then 'cause you
feel sorry for them

13:33.312 --> 13:34.706
for not being as lucky as you,

13:34.730 --> 13:36.865
you feed them an
expensive prime rib.

13:41.862 --> 13:43.497
That must be it.

13:45.491 --> 13:48.178
Hi. Were we gonna walk to
school together or something?

13:48.202 --> 13:49.304
Uh-uh. No.

13:49.328 --> 13:51.014
I figured, since I
missed you last night...

13:51.038 --> 13:52.965
Oh, I missed you too.

13:53.999 --> 13:56.593
Hey. Where would you be if
you were a physics book?

13:56.919 --> 13:58.146
No, no. I, uh...

13:58.170 --> 13:59.471
I mean, I, uh,

13:59.880 --> 14:02.067
came by to see you at the
restaurant and you weren't there.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.026
Oh.

14:03.050 --> 14:05.487
Oh, well, what happened is
Lynn ended up feeling better,

14:05.511 --> 14:06.988
and she didn't wanna
miss her shift

14:07.012 --> 14:08.240
'cause she's got
that little girl,

14:08.264 --> 14:09.690
so she showed up after all.

14:10.099 --> 14:11.733
You said you had a report.

14:11.934 --> 14:13.245
Yeah. Yeah.

14:13.269 --> 14:15.413
I got little antsy
after the 42nd year

14:15.437 --> 14:16.738
of the Hundred Year War.

14:16.897 --> 14:18.115
Found it.

14:19.358 --> 14:20.742
So, tonight?

14:21.277 --> 14:24.204
I mean, are you, uh,
busy or anything?

14:24.405 --> 14:27.300
Well, aren't you doing
something with your Dad?

14:27.324 --> 14:28.750
No. I bagged it.

14:29.076 --> 14:30.303
I mean, I like him and all,

14:30.327 --> 14:32.129
but he's just not
as cute as you are.

14:32.621 --> 14:34.840
Well, I have to have
dinner with everybody.

14:35.249 --> 14:36.466
Oh.

14:37.418 --> 14:38.687
Well, I'll pick you
up at the restaurant.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.231
No, I got a couple of
errands, you know,

14:41.255 --> 14:42.440
and it's kind of
out of your way,

14:42.464 --> 14:44.183
but I can meet you wherever.

14:44.466 --> 14:45.610
All right.

14:45.634 --> 14:47.487
We could go hear some music.
Or you know what?

14:47.511 --> 14:49.698
They're gonna blow up this
building down at the wharf.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.356
Be kind of cool to watch that.

14:51.432 --> 14:53.567
One big blast and it's all gone.

14:56.478 --> 14:58.071
I've got two words
for you, Kirsten.

14:58.397 --> 14:59.740
Cash bar.

15:00.691 --> 15:02.085
That never would
have occurred to me.

15:02.109 --> 15:04.578
See? Just keep asking. I
got a million of them.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.381
Hey, you know what
would be great?

15:06.405 --> 15:09.009
I'm glad you're wearing Mom's dress.
You know, keep up the tradition.

15:09.033 --> 15:10.260
It's probably not too yellow...

15:10.284 --> 15:11.511
- Mm-mm.
- Terrific.

15:11.535 --> 15:13.555
There is that
weird-shaped stain on it,

15:13.579 --> 15:16.892
but I'm sure laundry techniques are
so much more advanced these days.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.101
You know what'd be great?

15:18.125 --> 15:19.927
What? What would
be great, Claud?

15:20.085 --> 15:21.887
Why don't they have
their wedding here?

15:23.464 --> 15:24.765
Oh, my God.

15:25.007 --> 15:27.235
Oh, my God, that is brilliant!

15:27.259 --> 15:28.528
- Uh, I don't...
- No, no.

15:28.552 --> 15:30.196
Listen! It would be
practically free.

15:30.220 --> 15:31.281
Yeah! That's true.

15:31.305 --> 15:32.490
No. No.

15:32.514 --> 15:33.533
I can help decorate.

15:33.557 --> 15:36.036
I can make those tulips with
crepe paper and straws.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.120
They're very lifelike.

15:37.144 --> 15:38.737
And you've got the
stereo for music.

15:38.896 --> 15:39.915
No. No.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.698
Oh, and an entire
choice of the menu.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.920
And the party could go till,
like, four in the morning,

15:44.944 --> 15:46.087
and wouldn't cost any extra.

15:46.111 --> 15:47.537
Plus, there's ample parking.

15:48.072 --> 15:49.090
Charlie!

15:49.114 --> 15:50.675
Oh, man, he's gonna
go wild for this.

15:50.699 --> 15:52.793
Wait, wait. Let me tell him.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.712
- Good idea, huh?
- Mmm!

15:59.500 --> 16:01.468
<i> So, it's my
Fourteenth birthday,</i>

16:01.502 --> 16:03.021
and Will gives me this shirt.

16:03.045 --> 16:04.147
The ugliest thing
you've ever seen.

16:04.171 --> 16:06.191
Had to be on sale for,
like, 90 percent off.

16:06.215 --> 16:07.692
So for his next birthday,

16:07.716 --> 16:09.810
I wrapped it up, and I
gave it back to him.

16:09.927 --> 16:11.071
And then it became this joke

16:11.095 --> 16:12.948
where every year, we'd
give each other the shirt.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.324
Only now there's this challenge

16:14.348 --> 16:16.733
.where we have to think of ways to
surprise the other person with it,

16:16.767 --> 16:17.911
Like how?

16:17.935 --> 16:21.164
Well, like last year,
I put it on Thurber

16:21.188 --> 16:23.657
and I let him into Will's
room while he was sleeping.

16:24.191 --> 16:26.118
So, uh... so, when's
your birthday?

16:26.318 --> 16:27.744
I'm not telling you now.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.288
Chicken.

16:31.907 --> 16:33.125
Uh-oh.

16:33.575 --> 16:34.876
Shh.

16:35.744 --> 16:36.930
Oh, God. It's late.

16:36.954 --> 16:38.880
You know what? We should
really do the speech.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.225
- Right.
- Okay.

16:40.249 --> 16:41.883
Okay.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.386
What do we have so far?

16:44.628 --> 16:46.013
"Fellow classmates..."

16:48.257 --> 16:49.943
Okay, um, wait. Try something.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.403
Say the first thing that
comes into your head.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.196
Okay, I have excellent...

16:53.220 --> 16:54.322
Posture.

16:54.346 --> 16:55.448
Oh, that'll sell you.

16:55.472 --> 16:56.825
Would breath be better?

16:56.849 --> 16:59.318
Okay, I'm running for office...

16:59.685 --> 17:01.278
Under incredible duress.

17:01.437 --> 17:02.789
If elected...

17:02.813 --> 17:04.165
I will demand a recount.

17:04.189 --> 17:06.667
Oh, okay. That's gonna
be your speech, Bailey.

17:06.692 --> 17:07.669
I'm writing it down.

17:07.693 --> 17:08.952
No, you're not.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.746
- Yes, I am.
- You are not.

17:11.696 --> 17:12.715
Give me that.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.290
Give it back.

17:19.288 --> 17:21.131
I never realized you
were such a nerd.

17:21.540 --> 17:22.883
I'm not.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.634
Yes, you are.

17:24.667 --> 17:26.896
You are. You get this
look on your face,

17:26.920 --> 17:30.057
and your eyebrows get all furrowed
like it's so important to you.

17:30.424 --> 17:31.818
So?

17:31.842 --> 17:33.352
So it's cute.

17:33.594 --> 17:34.853
Yeah?

17:36.138 --> 17:37.522
Yeah.

17:41.435 --> 17:43.320
So, you know what I'm thinking?

17:44.146 --> 17:45.489
No.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.366
How about

17:48.442 --> 17:51.286
you just write it for me?

18:01.914 --> 18:02.849
Hey.

18:02.873 --> 18:04.299
Hi.

18:05.667 --> 18:08.970
Griffin, I, um... I
can't stay this time.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.725
It's an awful long
way to tell me that.

18:14.051 --> 18:16.103
I have to see Justin tonight.

18:17.012 --> 18:19.106
I mean, I want to.

18:19.807 --> 18:21.149
So just...

18:21.475 --> 18:22.901
Well, I'm going to.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.070
Okay.

18:25.229 --> 18:26.613
Okay.

18:31.527 --> 18:33.078
Why is that okay?

18:33.445 --> 18:34.672
What?

18:34.696 --> 18:37.666
Well, I mean, why is that
not a problem for you?

18:40.577 --> 18:42.337
Because he's your boyfriend.

18:43.080 --> 18:45.517
It doesn't bother you
that I saw you last night

18:45.541 --> 18:47.426
and tonight I'm gonna see him?

18:47.918 --> 18:49.521
I mean, I don't even
know why I'm doing this.

18:49.545 --> 18:51.106
I'm lying all the time,
and I can't sleep.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.399
And you know, if Justin
found out about this,

18:53.423 --> 18:55.308
his head would fly off.

18:55.759 --> 18:57.477
Better not tell him, then.

19:00.806 --> 19:02.441
Do you, like, want me to stay?

19:02.683 --> 19:04.244
I mean, is there any part of you

19:04.268 --> 19:06.079
that wants to say,
"Please don't go"?

19:06.103 --> 19:08.864
You know, "I don't
want you to see him."

19:11.692 --> 19:13.910
Look, I've got this rule.

19:15.070 --> 19:16.422
I don't tell anybody what to do,

19:16.446 --> 19:17.998
and nobody tells me.

19:18.323 --> 19:19.958
And it works.

19:22.619 --> 19:24.337
God, Griffin,

19:25.330 --> 19:26.798
you could at least

19:28.167 --> 19:29.593
care.

19:43.599 --> 19:45.317
Kirsten, where's my... Man!

19:45.934 --> 19:47.954
I can't look, or we'll
have bad luck, right?

19:47.978 --> 19:51.156
Oh, I think we're way past that.

20:02.159 --> 20:03.710
It's not a perfect fit, huh?

20:04.620 --> 20:06.055
They can take that
hem out, right?

20:06.079 --> 20:07.432
If you say another
word about this dress,

20:07.456 --> 20:09.174
I'm gonna have to kill you.

20:11.460 --> 20:12.969
Can I do something for you?

20:13.879 --> 20:15.064
When I was little,

20:15.088 --> 20:17.066
I would take one of
my Dad's white shirts

20:17.090 --> 20:18.850
and put it on my
head like a veil.

20:19.509 --> 20:22.354
I would make believe our
driveway was the aisle.

20:22.512 --> 20:24.523
I would pick flowers
for my bouquet.

20:24.973 --> 20:27.609
I've dreamt about my
wedding day for years,

20:28.143 --> 20:29.861
except it wasn't like this.

20:30.103 --> 20:31.956
I didn't look like the
<i>Land of the Giants.</i>

20:31.980 --> 20:33.917
My parents still talked to me.

20:33.941 --> 20:36.127
And for the reception, we
were in a ballroom, Charlie,

20:36.151 --> 20:37.128
a ballroom!

20:37.152 --> 20:38.546
Not in a Naugahyde booth!

20:38.570 --> 20:40.497
- Kirsten...
- Don't touch me!

20:40.989 --> 20:43.301
Okay, all right, obviously
this matters to you,

20:43.325 --> 20:45.178
so we will figure out another
way to do the wedding.

20:45.202 --> 20:47.055
No, no, no! These are signs.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.514
Signs? What are you
talking about?

20:48.538 --> 20:50.382
God is trying to
tell us something.

20:50.499 --> 20:52.101
- God?
- Or somebody.

20:52.125 --> 20:54.729
Look. I'm getting a twitch
in my eye, right there.

20:54.753 --> 20:55.939
So you're a little anxious.

20:55.963 --> 20:57.065
"A little anxious"?

20:57.089 --> 20:58.608
A little anxious?

20:58.632 --> 21:00.068
I'm gonna need a straitjacket!

21:00.092 --> 21:02.695
Hey, why don't I
wear one of those!

21:02.719 --> 21:04.656
It's white! It's classic!

21:04.680 --> 21:07.482
- Kirsten... - And it would have
to fit me better than this!

21:13.689 --> 21:16.658
You know, this is
not a bad speech.

21:16.775 --> 21:18.503
I mean, at 2 a.m.,
anything sounds good,

21:18.527 --> 21:19.963
but I reread it just now.

21:19.987 --> 21:22.048
- Do I have to memorize it?
- Oh, it's not too long.

21:22.072 --> 21:24.717
Oh, and this is what I did.
I put myself in your head

21:24.741 --> 21:27.428
you know so it would sound
like you, funny, smart,

21:27.452 --> 21:29.722
a little self-effacing but
in a good way, you know.

21:29.746 --> 21:31.683
And, in the end,
somebody that you'd want

21:31.707 --> 21:33.300
to play an important
part in your life.

21:33.583 --> 21:34.811
Who are you talking about?

21:34.835 --> 21:36.145
Oh, your brother.

21:36.169 --> 21:38.388
Oh. Which one?

21:39.131 --> 21:40.390
Do you wanna read it?

21:40.716 --> 21:41.651
I'll read it later.

21:41.675 --> 21:43.361
Thanks. Do you have any gum?

21:43.385 --> 21:44.644
Sure.

21:45.887 --> 21:48.523
Cool. Thanks. See you, guys.

21:49.975 --> 21:51.568
You wrote that speech for him?

21:52.477 --> 21:54.821
Well, we both worked on it.

21:56.398 --> 21:58.626
You know, Sarah, this
election is so not his thing.

21:58.650 --> 22:00.253
I mean, he doesn't
even talk about it.

22:00.277 --> 22:01.379
Why are you even bothering?

22:01.403 --> 22:02.912
Uh, because.

22:04.448 --> 22:05.874
Don't ask me that, okay?

22:06.199 --> 22:07.626
Do you know what
a poker face is?

22:07.868 --> 22:09.794
- Yeah.
- You don't have one.

22:11.038 --> 22:12.348
Yeah, but it's just that

22:12.372 --> 22:14.007
when I'm with him, you know?

22:14.833 --> 22:17.395
Oh, God. I shouldn't be
talking to you about this.

22:17.419 --> 22:20.388
Uh, please, don't say
anything to him.

22:22.382 --> 22:24.142
You know, the thing is, Sarah,

22:24.426 --> 22:26.237
if he's not paying any attention

22:26.261 --> 22:29.198
or saying things like,
"Let's be together"

22:29.222 --> 22:31.566
or, "Please don't
see anyone else,"

22:31.767 --> 22:33.036
and you stick around for that,

22:33.060 --> 22:35.862
then it's kind of your
problem that you feel bad.

22:37.272 --> 22:38.698
Trust me.

22:39.691 --> 22:40.960
But you'll find the right guy.

22:40.984 --> 22:42.535
I mean, he's out there.

22:42.986 --> 22:45.580
The one who tells you that
he has dreams about you.

22:45.989 --> 22:47.665
That's who you wanna be with.

22:54.164 --> 22:55.683
This is funny.

22:55.707 --> 22:57.926
The show at Atlas tonight.
Who's it from?

22:58.668 --> 23:00.220
The right guy.

23:15.727 --> 23:18.947
When we get a divorce,
you get this.

23:22.275 --> 23:24.744
I, uh... Uh-oh.

23:26.154 --> 23:27.664
I'm feeling a bit of a chill.

23:28.281 --> 23:29.467
Kids, kids, kids,

23:29.491 --> 23:31.052
tell Uncle Dudley
what the problem is.

23:31.076 --> 23:32.095
Let's share a little.

23:32.119 --> 23:33.179
Ask her.

23:33.203 --> 23:36.140
Something to do with God and
the cost of ice sculptures.

23:36.164 --> 23:37.266
Be quiet.

23:37.290 --> 23:38.601
Do you guys know
that statistically

23:38.625 --> 23:41.771
73 percent of all couples
end up hating each other

23:41.795 --> 23:43.648
during the course of
planning a wedding?

23:43.672 --> 23:45.399
- You made that up.
- Yes, I did.

23:45.423 --> 23:47.016
But I'm probably not far off.

23:47.259 --> 23:50.863
Pledging undying love for all
eternity is stressful enough,

23:50.887 --> 23:52.573
but then you got the
whole ceremony deal.

23:52.597 --> 23:54.200
You got music. You got food.

23:54.224 --> 23:56.285
You're practically producing
dinner theater on top of it.

23:56.309 --> 23:57.861
Am I right?

23:58.645 --> 23:59.831
No wonder you're
both a little nuts.

23:59.855 --> 24:01.406
Believe me, this will pass.

24:01.565 --> 24:02.708
I tell you, though,
for my money,

24:02.732 --> 24:05.452
the best way to do one of these
things is a quickie in Reno.

24:06.236 --> 24:08.705
No muss, no fuss, no bother.

24:08.738 --> 24:10.049
Bing, bang, boom.

24:10.073 --> 24:12.135
You're in. You're out.
You're married.

24:12.159 --> 24:13.710
That's just me.

24:18.039 --> 24:19.632
You're so adorable.

24:19.875 --> 24:21.176
No kidding.

24:21.501 --> 24:22.770
Any particular reason why?

24:22.794 --> 24:24.021
Come on, you know.

24:24.045 --> 24:25.722
No. I don't.

24:26.423 --> 24:27.984
But what the hell, as
long as you think so.

24:28.008 --> 24:29.068
Justin, I found...

24:29.092 --> 24:30.736
Okay, troops, big night tonight.

24:30.760 --> 24:33.188
A bunch of you are gonna get
a run at the real thing.

24:33.388 --> 24:37.358
I need volunteers for
the seven to ten slot.

24:38.268 --> 24:40.288
Wow! Would you look
at that show of hand.

24:40.312 --> 24:42.123
- Justin.
- What?

24:42.147 --> 24:43.490
We can't.

24:44.566 --> 24:47.202
- Why not?
- Come on!

24:48.111 --> 24:49.547
Oh, come on, don't be nervous.

24:49.571 --> 24:51.206
We're ready for this.
You'll be great.

24:51.448 --> 24:53.259
Paul. Justin.

24:53.283 --> 24:55.335
Yeah, and Julia too.

24:55.410 --> 24:56.711
Julia?

24:57.746 --> 24:59.088
Yes?

25:00.790 --> 25:02.300
Yeah.

25:15.388 --> 25:16.689
Heads up.

25:16.806 --> 25:18.983
Yeah. All right.

25:22.270 --> 25:23.915
Whoa. I'm impressed.

25:23.939 --> 25:26.866
Yeah, I used to play at sleep-away
camp before I got short.

25:28.235 --> 25:29.962
So did you read the speech?

25:29.986 --> 25:31.162
Ah!

25:31.279 --> 25:33.331
I left it in my locker.
I'm sorry.

25:34.449 --> 25:36.510
I'd love to have a
pair of sneakers

25:36.534 --> 25:37.877
named after me someday,

25:37.994 --> 25:39.420
Air Baileys.

25:39.537 --> 25:41.548
Oh, it's good to have a goal.

25:41.706 --> 25:44.101
I've started noticing that
some of the other candidates

25:44.125 --> 25:45.978
are putting those posters
up in the halls.

25:46.002 --> 25:47.438
Mm, I saw that too.

25:47.462 --> 25:49.055
Maybe you should do some.

25:51.258 --> 25:52.642
Three-pointer!

25:53.301 --> 25:54.519
Yes!

25:56.054 --> 25:57.272
What?

25:58.306 --> 26:00.284
You don't give a damn
about this, do you?

26:00.308 --> 26:02.870
Yes, I do. I give a
couple of damns.

26:02.894 --> 26:04.445
Two or three damns, at least.

26:04.688 --> 26:07.073
You're hilarious, has
anyone ever told you that?

26:08.692 --> 26:10.336
Look, Sarah, it's
not like I was ever

26:10.360 --> 26:13.037
rah-rah jumping up and down
about being vice president.

26:13.280 --> 26:14.664
I mean, you did kind of push.

26:14.948 --> 26:16.259
Well, then, you know,

26:16.283 --> 26:18.719
of course I should make
the posters by myself.

26:18.743 --> 26:20.763
I suppose I ought to give
the speech for you, too,

26:20.787 --> 26:22.682
since you can't even
bother to read it!

26:22.706 --> 26:25.008
Do you have any homework that
you need done while I am at it?

26:25.333 --> 26:26.894
Wait a second. Wait a second.
That's not fair.

26:26.918 --> 26:28.136
No! You're right!

26:28.253 --> 26:30.388
You know, you are
absolutely right.

26:30.755 --> 26:32.441
Someone's following
you around like a...

26:32.465 --> 26:34.026
like a stupid puppy,

26:34.050 --> 26:36.237
what else are you supposed
to do but yell, "Go fetch"?

26:36.261 --> 26:38.021
- Sarah...
- No!

26:39.431 --> 26:41.117
It's my fault.

26:41.141 --> 26:42.535
Okay? It's me.

26:42.559 --> 26:44.954
So you can do the campaign
yourself or don't do it, whatever.

26:44.978 --> 26:46.779
But I quit. I'm done.

26:50.775 --> 26:53.369
No, no, no, no. Don't
be embarrassed.

26:53.903 --> 26:55.298
That's why I'm here, you know?

26:55.322 --> 26:57.165
To, uh, to listen to you.

26:58.116 --> 26:59.542
Yeah.

27:00.160 --> 27:03.421
So, why don't you tell
me what's goin' on?

27:05.957 --> 27:07.175
<i> It's...</i>

27:07.792 --> 27:09.385
<i>It's my boyfriend.</i>

27:10.754 --> 27:12.722
<i>I mean, I love him.</i>

27:13.131 --> 27:14.599
<i>He's great.</i>

27:14.883 --> 27:17.894
<i>But something got messed up.</i>

27:19.220 --> 27:22.315
<i>All of a sudden, we're
so not connecting.</i>

27:23.892 --> 27:25.786
<i>I don't even know where
he is half the time.</i>

27:25.810 --> 27:29.238
<i>And if we have plans,
he'll show up late.</i>

27:29.439 --> 27:31.824
<i>Sometimes he doesn't
even bother to.</i>

27:33.193 --> 27:35.203
<i>And when I ask him about it,</i>

27:35.403 --> 27:37.747
<i>there's always some wild story.</i>

27:41.659 --> 27:44.921
<i>And he kisses different.</i>

27:46.247 --> 27:47.892
<i>And I know this sounds funny,</i>

27:47.916 --> 27:50.593
<i>but he even smells different.</i>

27:51.419 --> 27:55.264
<i>I don't know if it's
some place or someone.</i>

27:56.007 --> 27:58.976
<i>I asked him, but he told
me I was making it up.</i>

28:01.554 --> 28:03.815
<i>I really think he's
cheating on me.</i>

28:08.103 --> 28:09.654
I think you might be right.

28:16.653 --> 28:18.329
One minute, everything's fine,

28:18.571 --> 28:20.216
and, you know, we're
shooting baskets and stuff.

28:20.240 --> 28:22.500
Then the next minute,
she's talking about...

28:23.118 --> 28:25.596
I don't know, dogs or something,
and flipping out at me.

28:25.620 --> 28:27.046
And I didn't do anything.

28:27.288 --> 28:30.133
I mean, what did I do? Do
you think I did something?

28:31.501 --> 28:33.354
Women are complicated.

28:33.378 --> 28:34.929
That's part of our charm.

28:35.213 --> 28:36.482
- Julia.
- Where have you been?

28:36.506 --> 28:37.400
Doesn't matter.

28:37.424 --> 28:39.026
That what I should tell
Justin next time he calls?

28:39.050 --> 28:40.393
You smell like smoke.

28:40.677 --> 28:41.821
Justin called?

28:41.845 --> 28:43.322
- What's going on?
- Forget it.

28:43.346 --> 28:45.282
- Not good, Jule.
- You forget it too.

28:45.306 --> 28:47.451
Hey, one day, I'm gonna
crack your little code,

28:47.475 --> 28:48.828
and then you'll both be sorry.

28:48.852 --> 28:51.154
- I'm going to bed.
- No, no. Wait.

28:57.944 --> 29:00.047
Okay, look, we need your opinion

29:00.071 --> 29:01.914
about what to get
Kirsten and Charlie,

29:02.615 --> 29:04.584
you know, as a wedding present.

29:05.910 --> 29:07.930
Bailey thinks we should
get them a gravy boat.

29:07.954 --> 29:10.298
Wow. Could you pick
something less personal?

29:10.749 --> 29:12.017
A nice one.

29:12.041 --> 29:13.301
Hey, I know.

29:13.793 --> 29:15.553
Why don't we get it videotaped?

29:16.171 --> 29:18.681
The wedding, as our
present to 'em?

29:19.466 --> 29:22.778
Like Owen, I mean, he's not even
gonna remember any of this.

29:22.802 --> 29:25.448
Then at least this way, I
know it's not the same thing,

29:25.472 --> 29:27.366
but, hey, it's pretty close.

29:27.390 --> 29:29.034
And Charlie and Kirsten,

29:29.058 --> 29:31.819
how else will they actually
get to see the ceremony?

29:32.395 --> 29:33.821
That's a good point.

29:34.147 --> 29:35.698
Yeah. That's nice, Claud.

29:36.441 --> 29:38.076
Yeah, it's...

29:38.401 --> 29:40.369
something they'll have forever.

29:43.656 --> 29:44.999
We all will.

29:49.954 --> 29:51.807
They're gonna be so mad at us.

29:51.831 --> 29:53.684
You said it yourself.
This isn't about them.

29:53.708 --> 29:55.019
It's about you and me.

29:55.043 --> 29:57.563
But it seems so criminal,
sneaking out this way.

29:57.587 --> 29:59.138
I think it's sexy.

29:59.506 --> 30:02.058
Anyway, we're gonna be back
in time for Dud's party.

30:02.967 --> 30:04.236
I don't know.

30:04.260 --> 30:06.071
Kirsten, I would marry you

30:06.095 --> 30:08.449
in the window at Macy's. I
would marry you on a bus,

30:08.473 --> 30:11.285
whatever it takes so
that we are together

30:11.309 --> 30:14.278
and you do not have one more
second of aggravation over this.

30:14.687 --> 30:17.615
So let's get going, Mrs.
Salinger-to-be.

30:19.442 --> 30:20.868
Bennett-Salinger?

30:21.569 --> 30:22.922
We'll negotiate.

30:22.946 --> 30:24.288
Okay.

30:24.906 --> 30:26.666
Come on. We don't wanna
miss our flight.

30:45.468 --> 30:46.978
This is a joke.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.149
Right?

30:51.975 --> 30:54.068
We found it on the
fridge this morning.

30:54.185 --> 30:55.903
I guess none of us
heard them leave.

30:56.604 --> 30:58.958
What was their big hurry? Huh?

30:58.982 --> 31:01.659
I mean, it's not like she wouldn't sleep
with him until they were married.

31:06.489 --> 31:07.874
To hell with you, Charlie.

31:08.658 --> 31:10.177
To hell with both of you.

31:10.201 --> 31:12.211
How could they do this to us?

31:13.162 --> 31:15.057
It's like they couldn't even
bother to stop to think

31:15.081 --> 31:16.684
that maybe this matters to us.

31:16.708 --> 31:17.884
This is...

31:19.168 --> 31:20.229
I mean, it's not like,

31:20.253 --> 31:22.314
"Hey, we're going grocery shopping.
Wanna come with us?"

31:22.338 --> 31:23.399
This is our brother's wedding.

31:23.423 --> 31:26.110
And you'd think at least,
at the very least,

31:26.134 --> 31:27.518
they would be honest with us.

31:27.635 --> 31:29.854
See if I ever talk
to them again.

31:30.179 --> 31:31.407
Claud?

31:31.431 --> 31:33.316
Forget it. I'm not.

31:35.059 --> 31:36.652
I wanted to be there.

31:37.520 --> 31:39.373
I wanted to watch them say
all that mushy stuff.

31:39.397 --> 31:41.500
And I wanted to play
the wedding march

31:41.524 --> 31:43.002
and for us to throw rice,

31:43.026 --> 31:44.869
and maybe you'd
catch the bouquet.

31:47.113 --> 31:49.040
I wanted to watch them dance.

31:51.409 --> 31:52.877
I wanted to dance.

31:55.246 --> 31:57.048
It's always sad stuff.

31:57.457 --> 32:00.009
We're always together
for the sad stuff.

32:01.419 --> 32:02.803
Just once...

32:03.963 --> 32:06.390
why couldn't we be together
for something happy?

32:12.931 --> 32:14.408
Look, I admit it. You're right.

32:14.432 --> 32:16.118
I mean, I know I should
have called you,

32:16.142 --> 32:17.735
but I just kind of panicked.

32:18.770 --> 32:20.738
Justin, really.

32:20.897 --> 32:23.417
I kept thinking, "What if
I say the wrong thing?

32:23.441 --> 32:25.952
Or I make the person
calling feel even worse?"

32:25.985 --> 32:27.630
And I knew you'd be upset,

32:27.654 --> 32:29.006
and I knew Mr. Peck
would be upset.

32:29.030 --> 32:30.132
But I just couldn't do it,

32:30.156 --> 32:33.334
and I felt too stupid to tell you.
Okay?

32:41.542 --> 32:44.063
Do you remember when
we were, like, eight,

32:44.087 --> 32:48.724
and our families took this
vacation together to San Diego?

32:49.467 --> 32:50.977
Sure. Of course I do.

32:52.762 --> 32:55.690
I remember we were in
this park by the zoo.

32:55.848 --> 32:57.159
Oh, my God.

32:57.183 --> 32:58.786
I completely forgot
that was the trip.

32:58.810 --> 33:00.829
We were gonna go on the seesaw,

33:00.853 --> 33:03.332
and you decided that
you wanted to be funny

33:03.356 --> 33:05.167
and jump on it real fast.

33:05.191 --> 33:07.118
And the thing flew up
and hit me in the chin.

33:07.318 --> 33:08.953
Seven stitches right there.

33:10.279 --> 33:12.248
Probably never be able
to grow a decent beard.

33:14.909 --> 33:16.752
You remember how
freaked out you were?

33:17.286 --> 33:19.046
Yeah, I cried more than you.

33:19.914 --> 33:22.758
Kept saying that I couldn't
trust you anymore,

33:23.251 --> 33:27.680
that, now that you did this,
and you swore that I could,

33:28.506 --> 33:31.434
that you'd never do
anything like that again.

33:32.135 --> 33:33.436
Yeah.

33:36.389 --> 33:38.149
I was just thinking about that.

33:42.270 --> 33:44.030
Sarah, it's me again.
Are you there?

33:47.025 --> 33:48.210
Okay, you're not.

33:48.234 --> 33:50.713
You know, sometimes
I can be so dense.

33:50.737 --> 33:52.580
I should've realized
what was going on.

33:52.613 --> 33:54.040
So here's what I did.

33:54.198 --> 33:56.667
I talked to Will, and he's
gonna take over the campaign.

33:56.784 --> 33:58.220
And you can still be involved,

33:58.244 --> 33:59.972
you know, if you still wanna be.

33:59.996 --> 34:01.714
But he's gonna do all
the ground work.

34:02.331 --> 34:05.676
So that should fix
everything with us, right?

34:07.920 --> 34:10.723
And feel free to call me a jerk
next time we see each other.

34:11.507 --> 34:12.891
Bye.

34:14.427 --> 34:17.271
Okay, make yourself useful.
Here you go.

34:18.639 --> 34:19.699
Come on, Dud.

34:19.724 --> 34:21.659
We could still call everyone
if we split the list.

34:21.684 --> 34:22.745
No way, Bailey.

34:22.768 --> 34:24.580
Like I said before,
the show must go on.

34:24.603 --> 34:26.415
The kegs I bought
are nonrefundable.

34:26.438 --> 34:28.824
So, believe me, there's
gonna be a party.

34:30.193 --> 34:31.659
How's Claud?

34:34.697 --> 34:36.382
She's been playing that same
piece over and over again

34:36.407 --> 34:37.833
for the past two hours.

34:37.992 --> 34:39.636
Don't' worry. The peanut
will get over it.

34:39.659 --> 34:40.846
- Oh, by the way, Jules?
- Mmm?

34:40.870 --> 34:43.214
Some guy called for
you named Geffen.

34:43.664 --> 34:45.141
- Griffin?
- Griffin. Right.

34:45.166 --> 34:46.143
I told him you were out,

34:46.167 --> 34:49.094
but I said there's gonna be a party
here today so come on right over.

34:49.754 --> 34:50.938
No, you didn't.

34:50.963 --> 34:52.598
Dudley, tell me you didn't.

34:52.799 --> 34:54.141
Sorry, doll.

34:54.842 --> 34:56.268
Oh, God.

34:56.844 --> 34:58.896
So what? So Griffin's coming.
What's the big deal?

35:00.765 --> 35:03.359
Oh. Oh, forget it. Nothing.
You're right.

35:05.436 --> 35:07.581
Wait a second. That's who you've
been sneaking around with?

35:07.605 --> 35:09.541
With Griffin? You're
kidding, right?

35:09.565 --> 35:11.575
You know, Bailey, this is
so none of your business.

35:11.609 --> 35:13.327
I don't get you.
What about Justin?

35:13.444 --> 35:14.880
Huh? He's like...

35:14.904 --> 35:16.381
He's great. And that
is how you treat him?

35:16.405 --> 35:18.008
- That is so...
- Excuse me!

35:18.032 --> 35:20.469
You're one to talk. The
way you treat Sarah.

35:20.493 --> 35:22.387
- Sarah?
- You totally use her.

35:22.411 --> 35:24.223
No, I don't. I do not.

35:24.247 --> 35:25.599
And besides, we're not
talking about me.

35:25.623 --> 35:26.683
We're talking about you.

35:26.707 --> 35:28.134
No, we aren't.

35:33.631 --> 35:35.099
Eleven, please.

35:38.594 --> 35:40.354
All right, step right up.

35:42.598 --> 35:44.024
They look nervous.

35:45.726 --> 35:46.787
Dearly beloved...

35:46.811 --> 35:49.655
We could go back to that one
down the street with the Elvis.

35:49.897 --> 35:51.157
I don't think so.

35:55.194 --> 35:57.913
This is gonna make one hell
of a story to tell Owen.

35:59.323 --> 36:00.624
Definitely.

36:03.202 --> 36:05.004
You didn't bring a
camera, did you?

36:05.621 --> 36:07.006
Didn't you?

36:08.374 --> 36:10.217
Maybe they have one here.

36:12.712 --> 36:14.722
Probably costs extra.

36:14.881 --> 36:16.817
No. They throw that in.

36:16.841 --> 36:18.142
No charge.

36:18.885 --> 36:20.279
Oh, good.

36:20.303 --> 36:21.687
Thanks.

36:24.432 --> 36:25.900
Number 12.

36:37.570 --> 36:39.756
Don't think of it as an
engagement party, exactly.

36:39.780 --> 36:42.416
It's more of a very
casual wedding reception.

36:42.700 --> 36:45.836
Right. Where none of us was
invited to the ceremony.

37:00.509 --> 37:02.946
- Griffin.
- Hey, nice spread.

37:02.970 --> 37:04.239
Uh, listen, you've gotta leave.

37:04.263 --> 37:05.981
I'm not kidding.
Justin's coming.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.203
I'm gonna grab a beer.
You want something?

37:09.227 --> 37:11.737
Look, I'm telling you, you can't
be here when he gets here.

37:12.188 --> 37:13.572
Oh.

37:13.856 --> 37:15.199
Ah.

37:16.651 --> 37:18.077
I'm staying.

37:18.986 --> 37:20.579
Why are you doing this?

37:26.244 --> 37:28.379
Maybe there'd be
some dancing later.

37:31.207 --> 37:32.559
Hey, Claud. Party's out back.

37:32.583 --> 37:33.926
I'm boycotting.

37:36.963 --> 37:38.305
Okay.

37:44.971 --> 37:47.064
Hey, good. You're here.

37:47.390 --> 37:49.316
Add that to the pile
and come on outside.

37:51.519 --> 37:54.790
There's, uh... There's no guests
of honor, unfortunately,

37:54.814 --> 37:56.448
but got plenty of food.

37:57.692 --> 37:59.159
I'm, um...

37:59.318 --> 38:01.495
I'm not gonna stay.

38:02.446 --> 38:03.706
Why not?

38:05.032 --> 38:07.010
Why not? You're not
still pissed off at me.

38:07.034 --> 38:08.637
You got the message
I left, right?

38:08.661 --> 38:09.763
Yeah.

38:09.787 --> 38:11.265
Well, so then everything's
cool between us.

38:11.289 --> 38:12.975
Will's gonna take over, you
don't have to do anymore...

38:12.999 --> 38:15.759
God, would you stop talking
about the stupid election?

38:17.461 --> 38:19.847
Why? What is going on with you?

38:20.006 --> 38:24.403
Did you really think that I was doing all
of this because I'm so civic-minded?

38:24.427 --> 38:27.572
Or because I really care who
governs the student body?

38:27.596 --> 38:29.825
Or that it matters to me
whether it's me or Will

38:29.849 --> 38:31.734
who hangs your posters
in the hallway?

38:32.268 --> 38:35.112
God, I did it because I'm
in love with you, you jerk!

38:43.779 --> 38:45.581
Feel free not to say anything.

38:53.998 --> 38:55.549
What bit you?

39:03.299 --> 39:04.693
- Justin.
- Hey, you.

39:04.717 --> 39:06.570
Um, listen, can we go inside?

39:06.594 --> 39:07.904
I'm getting, like,
mosquito-bitten.

39:07.928 --> 39:09.406
Yeah, I wanna get
something to drink.

39:09.430 --> 39:10.898
There's stuff there too.

39:13.309 --> 39:14.453
What's he doing here?

39:14.477 --> 39:16.612
Are he and Bailey,
like, friends now?

39:19.482 --> 39:20.949
What?

39:21.442 --> 39:22.910
I, um...

39:29.867 --> 39:31.011
Oh, God.

39:31.035 --> 39:32.711
Justin, no, it was...

39:34.246 --> 39:36.799
Look, let's just go over here.
Come on.

39:44.465 --> 39:45.859
It's not what you think.

39:45.883 --> 39:47.476
What do I think?

39:49.428 --> 39:51.615
- What do I think?
- I don't know, but it's not...

39:51.639 --> 39:53.241
That you've been lying to me?

39:53.265 --> 39:54.701
Justine, please, can we
just talk about this?

39:54.725 --> 39:56.485
Oh, okay, okay, uh...

39:57.853 --> 40:01.407
So what, have you
been, uh, seeing him?

40:02.024 --> 40:03.701
Is that it?

40:08.239 --> 40:09.216
Stop it!

40:09.240 --> 40:11.542
Oh, I... I knew it.

40:11.951 --> 40:14.336
I-I knew there was
something up with you.

40:14.745 --> 40:16.296
But him?

40:17.289 --> 40:18.841
Him?

40:19.333 --> 40:20.592
Oh...

40:21.669 --> 40:23.595
Are you, uh...

40:25.548 --> 40:26.974
Are you and him...

40:27.049 --> 40:28.851
Justin, I love you.

40:32.596 --> 40:34.815
Then tell him to beat it.

40:35.474 --> 40:36.660
Go ahead.

40:36.684 --> 40:38.485
He's right out there.
Go tell him.

40:43.065 --> 40:44.575
Then that's it.

40:46.819 --> 40:48.746
- Justin, don't...
- Don't.

40:49.488 --> 40:50.841
Just forget it, okay?

40:50.865 --> 40:52.467
What, did you think
we wouldn't mind?

40:52.491 --> 40:53.969
I don't care what
you have to say.

40:53.993 --> 40:56.555
Claudia, please.
We need you too.

40:56.579 --> 40:59.465
Okay, I think I speak
for the group here.

40:59.790 --> 41:01.091
Kirsten and Charlie,

41:01.208 --> 41:03.937
oh, and take this in the
spirit of which it's intended.

41:03.961 --> 41:05.897
You guys are major creeps!

41:05.921 --> 41:08.233
You run off. You
leave us a note?

41:08.257 --> 41:10.110
Yeah, I mean, you
ruined all our plans.

41:10.134 --> 41:13.321
Guys, we didn't do it.

41:13.345 --> 41:14.897
We didn't get married.

41:15.890 --> 41:17.149
What?

41:17.183 --> 41:18.368
It was a joke?

41:18.392 --> 41:21.069
No. We were going to.

41:21.353 --> 41:23.081
We got all the way to Reno.

41:23.105 --> 41:25.324
We found a 24-hour chapel,

41:25.608 --> 41:28.076
and, uh, we waited.

41:28.736 --> 41:29.796
And then it was our turn.

41:29.820 --> 41:33.332
So we, uh, we walked
up this ratty aisle.

41:33.616 --> 41:35.302
And this justice of the peace...

41:35.326 --> 41:38.170
Man, he looked like somebody
right out of <i>Mayberry.</i>

41:38.454 --> 41:41.173
And he starts off the
way they usually do,

41:41.582 --> 41:43.008
"Dearly beloved."

41:43.417 --> 41:46.178
And we looked around, and
there was nobody there.

41:46.795 --> 41:48.607
Just some guys in
polyester tuxes

41:48.631 --> 41:51.141
and women in shiny dresses
waiting for their turn.

41:51.467 --> 41:52.611
And it's like...

41:52.635 --> 41:55.896
I never even thought about that
expression until that second.

41:56.222 --> 41:57.773
"Dearly beloved."

42:00.267 --> 42:01.652
That's you.

42:02.978 --> 42:04.446
Only you weren't there.

42:05.314 --> 42:06.615
That's really, I mean...

42:08.192 --> 42:10.077
Without you guys, what
would have been the point?

42:11.445 --> 42:12.871
So we couldn't.

42:14.573 --> 42:16.041
So we didn't.

42:16.450 --> 42:17.793
So we left.

42:18.327 --> 42:21.547
I hope you're still free the
third weekend in November.

42:22.748 --> 42:25.133
I think we can clear
our schedules.

42:25.501 --> 42:26.978
You wimps.

42:27.002 --> 42:29.096
I knew you couldn't
go through with it.

42:30.965 --> 42:33.392
Jeez, now I gotta go spring
for another present.

42:33.676 --> 42:34.694
Come on.

42:34.718 --> 42:36.979
Get your butts outside,
there's a party goin' on.

42:38.973 --> 42:41.952
All right. Okay. Hold it down.
Excuse me.

42:41.976 --> 42:43.662
Pardon me. False alarm.

42:43.686 --> 42:44.955
Thank you. False alarm.

42:44.979 --> 42:46.081
They didn't do it.

42:46.105 --> 42:47.666
If you can stop
yapping for a second,

42:47.690 --> 42:50.460
I'd like to propose a toast
to the non-newlyweds

42:50.484 --> 42:52.911
since I'm Charlie's
second-best man.

42:53.320 --> 42:54.673
- Before I do, - Here you go.

42:54.697 --> 42:57.249
uh, anybody here who think that
Kirsten is too good for Charlie,

42:57.700 --> 42:59.001
please raise your hand.

42:59.034 --> 43:00.627
Oh, shut up.

43:02.121 --> 43:03.807
Sweetheart, tell me,
do you have any idea

43:03.831 --> 43:05.016
what you're getting
yourself into?

43:05.040 --> 43:06.434
Have you given this any thought?
