[Brian] Previously on
What About Brian:

00:01.875 --> 00:04.208
- In a perfect world,
we'd be together.
- What's your problem?

00:04.208 --> 00:05.959
You had an affair
with my father.

00:05.959 --> 00:08.542
Why is it such a big deal
that I'm 20 years old?

00:08.542 --> 00:12.458
I should be the one freaking out
that you're divorced
with three kids.

00:12.458 --> 00:16.917
- She's so beautiful.
- That's what we'll call her.
Bella.

00:16.917 --> 00:19.125
I don't want people
looking at my wife.

00:19.125 --> 00:20.917
I quit.
Tonight's my last night.

00:20.917 --> 00:22.625
We're in this forever.

00:29.959 --> 00:33.500
Last hole, ladies.
This one's for all the marbles.

00:33.500 --> 00:37.333
When Brian and I win
a dinner bet,
we really like to chow down.

00:37.333 --> 00:39.875
Chow down all you want.
You'll be paying for it.

00:39.875 --> 00:41.583
All right. Brian, you're up.

00:42.709 --> 00:44.625
Long putt there, buddy.

00:44.625 --> 00:48.458
So is it, uh, weird? Dating
somebody's who dated your dad?

00:48.458 --> 00:50.625
You waited 18 holes
to use that one on me?

00:50.625 --> 00:52.417
Think you can rattle me
with that?

00:52.417 --> 00:55.417
I was just wondering
if you've had the ex talk.

00:55.417 --> 00:59.417
How many she's been with,
who she's been with, like...
your dad!

00:59.417 --> 01:02.625
Of course that would be awkward,
don't you think, Jimmy?

01:02.625 --> 01:05.417
- [Jimmy] It's
got to be awkward.
- Just slightly.

01:05.417 --> 01:08.208
- I have nerves of steel.
- [Dave] Come on, steel nerves.

01:08.208 --> 01:10.709
- Oh! Oh!
- That might...
That might work, Bri!

01:10.709 --> 01:12.792
Oh, too bad.

01:12.792 --> 01:16.083
- So close! Keep that chin up.
- Guess he didn't have the talk.

01:16.083 --> 01:18.792
We don't need the talk, Jimmy.
Just putt.

01:18.792 --> 01:23.417
- OK. Big Jim.
Taking some swings.
- Love it when you call me that.

01:23.417 --> 01:26.959
- [Dave] You and Ivy
have had the talk?
- What, are you kidding me?

01:26.959 --> 01:30.166
- Had it on the first date.
- How many she been
with since then?

01:30.166 --> 01:31.959
- [Jimmy gags]
- [guys] Oh!

01:31.959 --> 01:33.917
[Dave] That's rough.
You got wobbly.

01:33.917 --> 01:36.458
[Adam] You should try
putting left-handed.

01:36.458 --> 01:38.041
All right. Let me hear it.

01:38.041 --> 01:42.583
I'm seeing a 20-year-old.
I could be her daddy.

01:42.583 --> 01:44.709
She lives with her parents,
blah, blah.

01:44.709 --> 01:48.333
That pretty much covers it.
I mean, as long
as you know she really is 20.

01:48.333 --> 01:50.250
She could be lying.

01:50.250 --> 01:52.792
- Jail bait!
- Wow.

01:52.792 --> 01:56.375
Oh, well, you know what?
You should ask her
for ID on the next date.

01:56.375 --> 01:58.000
- Whatever.
- All right, boys.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.291
Thanks, pal.
You're a real good buddy.

02:00.291 --> 02:04.625
Watch and observe
as Jimmy and I win the bet.

02:04.625 --> 02:05.834
Be the ball, baby.

02:05.834 --> 02:08.291
Hey, you're married
to a stripper...

02:08.291 --> 02:09.458
Out of bounds.

02:09.458 --> 02:11.166
You ask how many
she's been with?

02:11.166 --> 02:14.125
I adhere to the strict policy
of don't ask, don't tell.

02:14.125 --> 02:16.291
And it's seems
to be working out...

02:16.291 --> 02:18.667
...just fine.

02:18.667 --> 02:22.375
- [Adam, Jimmy cheering]
- That's my boy! That's my boy!

02:22.375 --> 02:25.583
I'm telling you this right now,
no champagne this time.

02:25.583 --> 02:26.834
We'll see about that.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.500
- [Dave] Good morning!
- [Deena] Hey!

02:32.500 --> 02:35.917
- These were in my car.
- I've been looking for those.
Thanks.

02:35.917 --> 02:38.417
Girls! Daddy's here
to take you to school!

02:38.417 --> 02:41.917
So, what's been going on?
I haven't had a chance
to really talk lately.

02:41.917 --> 02:45.000
Um... Everything's good.
[chuckles]

02:46.834 --> 02:49.792
I've been thinking about
selling some of my cupcakes

02:49.792 --> 02:52.542
at more of the farmers' markets
in the afternoons,

02:52.542 --> 02:55.333
but I think I need
a little extra help
with the girls.

02:55.333 --> 02:58.834
Well, you know what?
KC Gaming just started
their daycare program.

02:58.834 --> 03:01.834
- Maybe we could use that.
- Yeah, that could work.

03:01.834 --> 03:05.709
I mean, you should know
that Roxanne,

03:05.709 --> 03:07.875
- Sandwich Girl, would be there.
- Oh.

03:07.875 --> 03:11.917
Nobody was buying her sandwiches
except for me, so I got her
the job.

03:11.917 --> 03:16.041
Oh, right. I thought
she was actually in daycare.

03:16.041 --> 03:19.417
- [both laughing]
- [girls] Daddy! Daddy!

03:19.417 --> 03:23.959
There they are,
my sweet pumpkins!
Pumpkin One and Pumpkin Two.

03:23.959 --> 03:26.166
[sighs] So,
what are you doing today?

03:26.166 --> 03:30.125
I'm going over to Nicole's,
so that I can see Bella.

03:30.125 --> 03:34.083
And I'm going to give her
some of the baby stuff
that we don't use anymore.

03:34.083 --> 03:36.667
Make sure you charge her for it.
There you go.

03:36.667 --> 03:40.542
All right, Jenny's mom
is taking you and Jenny
to ballet after school.

03:40.542 --> 03:42.917
And am I going to Pam's house
after school?

03:42.917 --> 03:44.792
Yes, you are
going to Pam's house.

03:44.792 --> 03:48.166
Come on, we're going to be late.
Get into the car.

03:48.166 --> 03:51.041
- So, we pretty much
got this down.
- Yep, we do.

03:55.583 --> 04:00.667
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry!
Come on, hon! Oh!

04:04.250 --> 04:07.083
Are we going to spend the night
at your place or mine?

04:07.083 --> 04:10.291
- I vote mine. It's easier.
- Yeah, easier for you.

04:10.291 --> 04:11.959
All your stuff is there.

04:11.959 --> 04:16.291
I have to pack an overnight bag,
again. So how about
tomorrow night?

04:16.291 --> 04:18.458
I'm going out with the guys
tomorrow night.

04:18.458 --> 04:20.917
When do I get to go out
with you and your friends?

04:22.417 --> 04:25.750
What if I set up something
with Adam and Heather?

04:25.750 --> 04:28.000
You know, like a double date.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.291
That sounds fun.
Very Brady Bunch.

04:31.291 --> 04:33.625
So, you like The Brady Bunch?

04:33.625 --> 04:36.625
What? There's still a lot
I don't know about you.

04:36.625 --> 04:39.417
Like, how old are you?
How long you've lived in L.A.?

04:39.417 --> 04:44.083
How many guys you've slept with?
If you like The Brady Bunch?

04:44.083 --> 04:46.417
That was the worst segue
I've ever heard.

04:46.417 --> 04:49.875
- I know. I'm sorry.
- Thirty-six.

04:51.875 --> 04:54.125
You've had sex
with 36 different guys?

04:54.125 --> 04:55.667
That's my age, Brian.

04:55.667 --> 04:58.667
Look, I don't care
how many guys you've slept with.

04:58.667 --> 05:02.583
It's the relationship
that counts. That's what
we should talk about.

05:02.583 --> 05:05.375
The two or three guys
who really meant something.

05:05.375 --> 05:08.375
- And you want to do this now?
- Sure. We have time to kill.

05:08.375 --> 05:11.500
OK. Um, let's see,
there's Gary,

05:11.500 --> 05:15.083
he was my college boyfriend
who was actually my fiancÃ©,

05:15.083 --> 05:16.709
until it kind of fell apart.

05:16.709 --> 05:20.500
And then there was Tom,
who I thought was a perfect guy

05:20.500 --> 05:24.041
until he told me that
he lost his virginity
to his second cousin.

05:24.041 --> 05:26.041
Yeah, pretty gross.

05:26.041 --> 05:29.333
Then there was Charlie,
who my parents adored,

05:29.333 --> 05:31.709
which made me not adore him.

05:31.709 --> 05:33.583
Who was after Charlie?

05:34.875 --> 05:38.458
Nick! Nick is after Charlie.

05:40.250 --> 05:45.542
Shh. Wait. She's sleeping. OK.
Good. Those are sneakers.

05:45.542 --> 05:47.875
Because I never knew
how loud shoes were.

05:49.917 --> 05:53.000
Whoever invented hardwood floors
never had kids.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.875
Sweetie, you don't have
to whisper. The baby's room
is all the way in the...

05:56.875 --> 05:58.875
OK.

05:58.875 --> 06:00.542
She doesn't like the nursery.

06:00.542 --> 06:02.375
I put her in,
she starts crying.

06:02.375 --> 06:06.834
- The stuffed animals scare her.
- Just take the
stuffed animals out.

06:06.834 --> 06:09.291
Oh, no. She loves it in here.

06:09.291 --> 06:12.750
I come here and breast-feed her
and she always falls asleep.

06:12.750 --> 06:16.125
I just roll over, and she's
sleeping so beautifully

06:16.125 --> 06:18.208
and then I sleep on the couch...

06:18.208 --> 06:21.083
I think she likes
the sound of the clock.

06:21.083 --> 06:24.792
Uh... Here's an idea,
just a thought.

06:26.125 --> 06:29.917
Maybe did you ever think
of moving the clock?

06:29.917 --> 06:33.875
I've gone crazy,
haven't I? I'm crazy.

06:33.875 --> 06:35.917
No, honey, you're not crazy...

06:35.917 --> 06:38.542
You don't know what it's like
to do this all alone.

06:38.542 --> 06:41.417
OK. Honey,
I'm just going to show you

06:41.417 --> 06:45.250
a little something
that worked for me.

06:45.250 --> 06:46.583
Trust me.

06:49.625 --> 06:51.208
All right.

06:51.208 --> 06:53.250
Grab the bassinet, sweetie.

06:53.250 --> 06:54.959
Get it. Go on.

07:04.458 --> 07:08.041
Just a little close to the bed.
It's OK. OK, now watch.

07:09.125 --> 07:10.458
Do it just...

07:10.458 --> 07:12.959
...like... that.

07:16.125 --> 07:18.834
And that is called
a double arm transfer.

07:18.834 --> 07:21.458
Dave taught me that one.

07:21.458 --> 07:24.125
A husband is the most
underrated person on earth.

07:24.125 --> 07:26.959
Even if he's just there
in the bed grunting,

07:26.959 --> 07:30.917
at least someone's there
to tell you it's all going
to be OK at 3:00am.

07:30.917 --> 07:34.291
[Bridget] And then after Josh,
I kind of threw myself
into my work

07:34.291 --> 07:38.583
- until I met, well...
he didn't count.
- We should, uh, get out front.

07:38.583 --> 07:41.959
- People will
be here any minute.
- Not so fast. It's your turn.

07:41.959 --> 07:44.625
We don't have time.
Yours took two hours.

07:44.625 --> 07:48.125
Oh, you're hilarious.
Just talk fast.

07:48.125 --> 07:51.583
There was Car Girl,
Traffic School Girl, the Lisas,

07:51.583 --> 07:53.125
and the Loud Talker.

07:53.125 --> 07:57.834
Those are even real names.
I want stories.
I gave you stories.

07:57.834 --> 07:59.959
[laughs] You know,
there are no stories.

07:59.959 --> 08:02.166
We dated, we broke up.
End of story.

08:02.166 --> 08:04.834
OK, who was
the last girl you kissed?

08:04.834 --> 08:06.834
Car Girl,
but that was part of a bet.

08:06.834 --> 08:11.166
I'm beginning to think
you have a little bit
of a gambling problem.

08:11.166 --> 08:14.750
Come on. Who was the last girl
that you kissed by choice?

08:15.875 --> 08:17.500
[exhales]

08:18.625 --> 08:22.166
I don't know.
I guess, um, Marjorie.

08:22.166 --> 08:24.208
And does Marjorie
have a nickname?

08:24.208 --> 08:28.333
Nope, just Marjorie.
We didn't actually date.
It was more of a...

08:28.333 --> 08:30.083
Sorry. Are we early?

08:30.083 --> 08:32.875
No! No, no.
Come on in. Come on in.

08:32.875 --> 08:36.875
You guys will take cash
for this place, won't you?

08:36.875 --> 08:39.291
Yeah! Absolutely.

08:42.917 --> 08:44.875
[slap]

08:44.875 --> 08:47.291
Oh! I got you a present.

08:47.291 --> 08:50.041
Sorry, it's not wrapped,
but...

08:50.041 --> 08:55.041
- [Nicole] Ooh!
- [Deena chuckles]

08:55.041 --> 08:59.500
They're nipple protectors.
They saved my life, so...

08:59.500 --> 09:02.250
Thanks, I think.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.709
Hey! I got you
a present too.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.250
Oh! A magazine. Wow.

09:09.250 --> 09:12.375
They run a column, the hottest
flower shops in L.A.,

09:12.375 --> 09:14.041
the hottest pancakes
in L.A...

09:14.041 --> 09:16.625
Oh, yeah. I've read that column.
It's never right.

09:16.625 --> 09:20.625
Not next month,
when they're going to say,
"The Hottest Cupcake in L.A."

09:20.625 --> 09:23.208
The hottest cupcake?
You didn't!

09:23.208 --> 09:26.792
I called them. I let them
put one of my bands
on their cover last year.

09:26.792 --> 09:30.041
It was the hottest selling issue
they ever had, so they owe me.

09:30.041 --> 09:33.500
So, right here,
in two nights,

09:33.500 --> 09:35.875
in this very house,

09:35.875 --> 09:39.625
they're going to shoot
a layout with the Hottest
Cupcake in L.A., Deena Greco.

09:39.625 --> 09:42.583
- I can't do that!
- Yes, you can.

09:42.583 --> 09:48.208
You are going to be the most
perfect, most photogenic
cupcake in all of L.A.

09:48.208 --> 09:50.834
Wow. Well, I guess I'm going
to have to get someone

09:50.834 --> 09:54.750
to watch the girls
so I can bake, but...

09:54.750 --> 09:58.125
- Thanks, Nic. Oh!
- Watch the boobs!

09:59.250 --> 10:01.625
I can't believe
I agreed to these pillows.

10:01.625 --> 10:05.667
- I mean,
could they be more flowery?
- Oh, they're just pillows.

10:05.667 --> 10:09.291
We can always take them back.
I just want to see
what they look like.

10:09.291 --> 10:11.500
As long as they're
on your side of the bed.

10:11.500 --> 10:15.625
Hey, I didn't complain
when you bought that gigantic...

10:15.625 --> 10:17.417
...television.

10:20.333 --> 10:22.959
Please tell me I'm not seeing
what I'm not seeing.

10:22.959 --> 10:24.875
You're seeing it. It's gone.

10:26.792 --> 10:29.166
I'll go see
if anything else is missing.

10:33.166 --> 10:36.166
Who steals a TV
and nothing else?

10:36.166 --> 10:38.375
[Heather] Some
of my clothes are missing.

10:38.375 --> 10:41.041
And my favorite pair of heels.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.834
What, were we
robbed by a pervert?

10:45.166 --> 10:46.500
What's this?

10:50.000 --> 10:52.333
- Oh, no.
- What?

10:52.333 --> 10:54.333
It's a dollar bill
shaped like an S.

10:54.333 --> 10:56.500
- So?
- So I think I know
who did this.

11:02.041 --> 11:04.000
[âª Low Stars:
Calling All Friends]

11:04.000 --> 11:08.667
âª Calling all friends
and people I met
on the way down âª

11:08.667 --> 11:14.542
âª Calling all friends
and people I don't even know âª

11:14.542 --> 11:19.041
âª Calling on high
I want to believe
there's a way now âª

11:21.208 --> 11:26.041
âª I'm too tired to pretend
I don't want to be alone âª

11:26.041 --> 11:29.125
âª I'm calling all friends âªâª

11:35.875 --> 11:38.500
And you think it
was this guy Schmitty?

11:38.500 --> 11:40.709
That's what we
called him at the club.

11:40.709 --> 11:43.709
He was very upset when he
found out that I was quitting.

11:43.709 --> 11:46.417
All based on this dollar bill
you found on the floor?

11:46.417 --> 11:49.667
It sounds crazy, but that's how
he used to tip me at the club,

11:49.667 --> 11:52.458
fold the dollar into an "S"
before he put it in my...

11:52.458 --> 11:56.083
- Heather, we get it.
- Oh! "S" was for Schmitty.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.250
Actually, "S" was for Summer.

11:58.250 --> 12:00.166
- What's Summer?
- My dancer name.

12:00.166 --> 12:03.750
- Can we talk about my TV?
- Your TV's probably long gone
by now.

12:03.750 --> 12:07.041
We'll talk to this Schmitty guy
when we get around to it.

12:07.041 --> 12:11.125
You can file a report
with the serial number
on the TV in case it turns up,

12:11.125 --> 12:13.291
but they usually
rub those off.

12:13.291 --> 12:16.750
- So that's it?
That's all I can do?
- What kind of TV was it?

12:16.750 --> 12:19.583
It was a 57-inch
hi-def LCD on a swivel.

12:19.583 --> 12:22.458
- [whistles] Those are
pretty sweet.
- Tell me about it.

12:22.458 --> 12:26.375
I'll let you know
if anything turns up,
but don't hold your breath.

12:26.375 --> 12:27.875
Good night.

12:31.166 --> 12:34.625
- [door closes]
- [sighs]

12:34.625 --> 12:38.291
So this, uh, Schmitty was your
boyfriend? Is that what this is?

12:38.291 --> 12:42.792
No. He just really liked me,
and he freaked out when I left.

12:42.792 --> 12:44.792
The girls said he
was asking where I went.

12:44.792 --> 12:46.291
Why? Did you lead him on,

12:46.291 --> 12:48.834
make him think you were
going to sleep with him?

12:48.834 --> 12:51.291
Of course I did.
That was my job.

12:51.291 --> 12:54.458
The guy paid for a lot
of lap dances, but it
wasn't a big deal.

12:54.458 --> 12:56.166
It's not a big deal?

12:56.166 --> 12:59.792
Some psychopath is
stalking you and he stole my TV
and it's not a big deal?

12:59.792 --> 13:02.000
- It's a big deal.
- The police will handle it.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.333
Why don't you give them
a list of all your exes

13:04.333 --> 13:07.959
- before my couches
start to disappear?
- He was not my ex!

13:11.333 --> 13:14.583
- This place is great!
- Yeah, pretty cool, huh?

13:16.125 --> 13:18.500
- And this is Carrie?
- Yeah, this is Carrie.

13:18.500 --> 13:21.500
She's adorable!
They're all adorable.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.625
Thank you for
helping me get this job.

13:23.625 --> 13:25.500
Are you kidding me?
Of course.

13:25.500 --> 13:29.166
I never knew I'd be meeting
your kids so soon.
This is a big step for us.

13:30.375 --> 13:32.458
I'm kidding, silly.

13:32.458 --> 13:35.041
- I knew that you were kidding.
- Yeah, right.

13:35.041 --> 13:36.667
OK, I got it from here.

13:36.667 --> 13:39.458
Yeah, you want to go over
and say hi to Roxanne?

13:39.458 --> 13:43.041
- Yeah. Good.
- [Carrie fusses]

13:43.041 --> 13:46.500
- All right, girls.
I'll see you soon.
- [girls] Bye, Daddy!

13:52.792 --> 13:56.208
[Brian] Oh, my God,
what did you do?

13:56.208 --> 13:58.250
I need you
to get rid of them, OK?

13:58.250 --> 14:01.375
Bri, just give them
to charity or something.

14:01.375 --> 14:03.750
I gave you this one.

14:03.750 --> 14:05.959
She doesn't like them.

14:05.959 --> 14:08.583
How do you know?

14:08.583 --> 14:13.208
OK, I don't like them.
They cause allergies
and they're scary.

14:13.208 --> 14:16.291
OK. I'll pack them in plastic
and put them in the garage.

14:16.291 --> 14:18.208
Some day Bella's
going to want them.

14:20.583 --> 14:22.375
- OK. Come.
- OK.

14:23.709 --> 14:26.875
[Brian laughs quietly]
She's so beautiful.

14:26.875 --> 14:29.041
She shouldn't wake up,
but if she does,

14:29.041 --> 14:31.542
give her your finger
to suck on until I get back.

14:31.542 --> 14:34.458
Make sure to wash your hands
really well with hot water.

14:34.458 --> 14:37.333
- What about a pacifier?
- I'm trying to avoid them.

14:37.333 --> 14:39.000
They're really bad
for the teeth.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.083
She doesn't have any teeth.
So I guess you don't want this?

14:43.083 --> 14:44.917
No. Just put that
with the animals.

14:45.875 --> 14:47.583
OK. I'm going
to go to the market.

14:48.750 --> 14:51.083
Wait. Are you sure?
Because I can go for you.

14:51.083 --> 14:54.583
Are you kidding? I haven't seen
the outside world in ten days.

14:54.583 --> 14:58.250
Nic, is it all right if Bridget
and I stop by tomorrow?

14:58.250 --> 15:01.583
I really...
I want you to meet her.

15:01.583 --> 15:04.417
Wow. It sounds like you guys
are getting pretty serious.

15:04.417 --> 15:07.250
Pretty serious, yeah.
We even had the exes talk.

15:07.250 --> 15:09.959
- Including Dad?
- We sort of skipped over that.

15:09.959 --> 15:13.083
- Oh. It's good
to see you happy.
- Yeah.

15:13.083 --> 15:16.250
- OK. I won't be long.
- Are you going to change first?

15:16.250 --> 15:19.375
- What's wrong with this?
- Nothing.

15:19.375 --> 15:23.375
I just wanted to make sure
you weren't going to change,
because you look fine.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.208
OK. OK.

15:26.792 --> 15:28.125
OK.

15:40.792 --> 15:41.792
How old?

15:44.041 --> 15:45.667
Thirty... something.

15:45.667 --> 15:49.417
- The baby?
- Oh, no.
Three and a half weeks.

15:49.417 --> 15:51.792
Well, no wonder you look
like a tornado hit you.

15:54.083 --> 15:57.291
- [Bella crying]
- It's nap-nap time.
It's nap-nap time.

15:57.291 --> 16:01.667
Yeah, look at Brian.
Look at Uncle Brian. [babbles]

16:01.667 --> 16:02.709
See this?

16:03.875 --> 16:07.166
[Bella still crying]

16:07.166 --> 16:11.667
No? OK, OK, OK.
Lay down. Lay down.

16:11.667 --> 16:17.667
Yeah. There you go. Come on,
Bella. Please, Bella, come on.

16:17.667 --> 16:21.875
OK. Pinkie time. Pinkie time.
There's the pinkie.

16:21.875 --> 16:23.834
No? OK.

16:25.500 --> 16:27.000
All right.

16:33.542 --> 16:35.625
[cooing]

16:36.625 --> 16:38.834
Don't tell your Mom.

16:38.834 --> 16:40.875
You keep that
in your sock drawer.

16:40.875 --> 16:44.208
That's where Uncle Bri used
to keep his contraband items.

16:44.208 --> 16:47.667
- [cooing]
- [sighs]

16:52.917 --> 16:55.250
[sighs]

16:55.250 --> 16:58.709
[Dave] OK, girls, show Mommy
what you got. Come on,
come on, come on...

16:58.709 --> 17:02.333
- It's sushi!
- Wow, that is sushi!

17:02.333 --> 17:06.000
It was Roxanne's idea.
You know, the girl
from Daddy's work?

17:06.000 --> 17:08.250
Wow, that was
really nice of her.

17:08.250 --> 17:10.834
- And she gave us more stuff...
- Easy, tigers.

17:10.834 --> 17:12.834
...so we can make
some for you, too.

17:12.834 --> 17:16.417
- Sounds like you guys
really liked her.
- We loved her. She's so nice.

17:16.417 --> 17:19.542
- And so pretty.
- And she does this funny...

17:19.542 --> 17:21.041
Uh-huh! Wow! OK.

17:21.041 --> 17:24.750
So, why don't you guys run on in
there and make Mommy some sushi?

17:24.750 --> 17:27.291
- [girls] OK!
- OK.

17:27.291 --> 17:29.583
You better wipe that smirk
off your face.

17:29.583 --> 17:32.750
What smirk? It wasn't a smirk.

17:32.750 --> 17:35.917
I was grimacing, angrily.

17:35.917 --> 17:39.709
I don't know what
your problem is.
You don't have to be jealous.

17:39.709 --> 17:43.166
Trust me, I'm not jealous.
I do know my girls
love me more than

17:43.166 --> 17:46.208
- your new girlfriend.
- Carrie!
She's not my girlfriend.

17:46.208 --> 17:48.250
We've been out
a couple of times.

17:48.250 --> 17:51.375
Listen, you don't have to make
me feel better, all right?

17:51.375 --> 17:55.583
I have nothing to prove.
I know that my girls
spend all day with Roxanne...

17:55.583 --> 17:57.208
- Carrie! Oh!
- Carrie!

17:57.208 --> 18:00.959
[Dave] Whoa! Whoa!
Carrie! Carrie! It's OK, honey.

18:00.959 --> 18:04.125
It's OK. Mommy, help get?
Are you OK, sweetheart?

18:04.125 --> 18:05.458
You all right, honey?

18:05.458 --> 18:10.542
Mommy, can we please have
Roxanne baby-sit every night?

18:10.542 --> 18:11.875
No.

18:15.959 --> 18:19.458
- I still don't get
why she's here.
- You think I invited her?

18:19.458 --> 18:21.792
This restaurant was my idea.

18:21.792 --> 18:24.625
I've been wanting to try
a new steak place. Get over it.

18:24.625 --> 18:27.750
- Your rib eye's
on a separate check.
- Fine with me.

18:27.750 --> 18:29.417
Can we please
get back to the TV?

18:29.417 --> 18:33.000
- Mmm. TV? What's up? It's gone?
- Yeah. History.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.083
You're letting this guy
get away with it?

18:35.083 --> 18:37.458
He's clearly
her ex-boyfriend.

18:37.458 --> 18:41.458
He's not her ex-boyfriend, OK?
He's just a former...

18:41.458 --> 18:43.333
A former customer.
I know, I know.

18:43.333 --> 18:46.333
But, see,
regular strip-club customers

18:46.333 --> 18:50.250
don't hunt down ex-strippers
and steal their stuff.
At least I don't think they do.

18:50.250 --> 18:52.333
Find this Schmitty,
show him who's boss.

18:52.333 --> 18:54.291
- Schmitty.
- You know what I'm saying?

18:54.291 --> 18:57.083
- Give him a bit
of the Hillman hell.
- Hillman hell?

18:57.083 --> 18:59.959
I'm trying, man.
Look what I have to work with.

18:59.959 --> 19:02.625
Speaking of exes,
you and Bridget have that talk?

19:02.625 --> 19:04.959
We did, and it went well.
Long, but well.

19:04.959 --> 19:07.875
- So you told her
about Marjorie?
- Whoa, whoa!

19:07.875 --> 19:11.333
- I still don't know
why she's here.
- Why would he say anything...

19:11.333 --> 19:15.041
Why would he say anything
about Marjorie?
She's my ex, not his.

19:15.041 --> 19:18.166
If you were dating Brian,
wouldn't you want
to know about Marjorie?

19:18.166 --> 19:22.500
If I were dating Brian,
I'd be thrilled because
then I'd still have my TV.

19:22.500 --> 19:24.834
There's a reason
you didn't tell Bridget.

19:26.583 --> 19:30.667
- This is ice-cold.
- Baby, no. No, no.

19:30.667 --> 19:34.333
I'm a member of the
service industry.
This is for their own good.

19:34.333 --> 19:38.667
She always does this.
They're going to spit in our
food. Don't order dessert.

19:38.667 --> 19:41.417
- Whoa! Where are you going?
- Left my wallet in my car.

19:41.417 --> 19:45.375
- I'll be right back.
- Nice! Sticking
Dave with the check.

19:45.375 --> 19:48.542
- What's up
with Dave and the check?
- Champagne, please.

20:07.375 --> 20:09.041
Marjorie?

20:13.000 --> 20:14.083
[Ivy] Hey.

20:14.083 --> 20:17.041
What, you trying to run out
on the check?

20:17.041 --> 20:18.417
Scared the crap out of me.

20:18.417 --> 20:21.542
- What's the matter?
- Nothing, nothing. I'm fine.

20:27.041 --> 20:28.875
But I think
I just saw Marjorie.

20:36.333 --> 20:41.125
It was Marjorie. She was
walking over there across
the street. I saw her.

20:41.125 --> 20:44.291
That makes perfect sense
because Marjorie is in Idaho.

20:44.291 --> 20:47.041
- Minnesota.
- Whatever, same thing.

20:47.041 --> 20:50.291
The point is, whoever you
think you saw, it wasn't her.

20:50.291 --> 20:52.417
Well, it looked
exactly like her.

20:52.417 --> 20:55.166
That is because you are seeing
through guilty eyes.

20:55.166 --> 20:58.083
You know, you should've
told Bridget and you didn't

20:58.083 --> 21:01.083
and now it's eating you up
and you're imagining things.

21:01.083 --> 21:03.834
Don't you think you would know
if Marjorie was here?

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
Maybe we shouldn't tell the guys
about this just yet, OK?

21:11.000 --> 21:13.291
Maybe you should pay
for my rib eye.

21:14.125 --> 21:16.625
It's all right. It's OK.

21:26.792 --> 21:30.166
Hi! Hi! There's my girl.

21:30.166 --> 21:34.125
- Hi, you must be Dave's...
Mrs. Greco?
- Yes, and you must be Roxanne.

21:34.125 --> 21:36.417
So nice to meet you.
Your kids are great.

21:36.417 --> 21:40.166
Thank you. I know.
Carrie, come to Mommy.
Come say hi, baby. Come on.

21:41.792 --> 21:45.959
OK. Um... How's she been doing?
She's been teething.

21:45.959 --> 21:48.333
She's good. I gave her
some graham crackers.

21:48.333 --> 21:50.583
She likes the way
it feels on her gums.

21:50.583 --> 21:52.917
There are graham crackers
right in this bag.

21:52.917 --> 21:54.667
I do know
what my children like.

21:54.667 --> 21:58.041
Sorry. I'm not trying to tell
you how to raise your daughter.

21:58.041 --> 22:00.959
OK. That's good. That's good.
That's nice. Here you go.

22:00.959 --> 22:02.917
- Just checking on my girl.
- Hi.

22:02.917 --> 22:06.375
This is awkward.
What are you doing here?
On your way to the Oscars?

22:06.375 --> 22:09.834
[laughs] Funny. No. I have
that photo shoot, remember,

22:09.834 --> 22:12.458
and I wanted to bring Carrie
her teething ring.

22:12.458 --> 22:15.625
- Can we talk for a sec? Alone?
- Sure. Excuse me.

22:17.208 --> 22:20.667
What are you doing? I mean,
really. Are you this insecure?

22:20.667 --> 22:24.542
- What's the big deal?
- This isn't a competition,
Deen. You're the mother.

22:24.542 --> 22:26.583
Carrie loves you
more than anybody else.

22:26.583 --> 22:27.709
- Oh, I know.
- OK.

22:27.709 --> 22:29.250
So don't come
in here looking hot

22:29.250 --> 22:31.250
and making
her feel like a slob.

22:31.250 --> 22:33.291
OK, for the record,
thank you.

22:33.291 --> 22:35.542
And, um, that's not
what I was trying to do.

22:35.542 --> 22:39.375
But I really got to get
going now, so, bye-bye, Dave.

22:39.375 --> 22:40.375
OK, bye-bye.

22:46.208 --> 22:49.583
All right, I called
the strip club,
pretending that I was a cop.

22:49.583 --> 22:52.875
I got his name, ran it through
the system. I got his address.

22:52.875 --> 22:54.875
It was easy.
So you're in, right?

22:54.875 --> 22:56.667
No. I am not in.

22:56.667 --> 22:59.000
Why not? It was your idea
in the first place.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.125
You don't know anything
about Schmitty.

23:01.125 --> 23:03.542
Are we going to walk in
and ask for the TV back?

23:03.542 --> 23:06.083
He could have a gun.
Jimmy don't do guns.

23:06.083 --> 23:07.250
He doesn't have a gun!

23:08.917 --> 23:12.000
Besides,
Heather says he's harmless.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.917
- So you've told her
what you're doing?
- You, crazy? She'd kill me.

23:17.125 --> 23:19.208
Oh, come on, Jimmy. I need you.

23:19.208 --> 23:21.875
If he's so harmless,
what do you need me for?

23:21.875 --> 23:25.333
Because you're my wingman, dude.
It's like Top Gun.

23:25.333 --> 23:28.375
We're like Maverick and Goose.

23:28.375 --> 23:30.917
- Which one am I?
- You're Goose!

23:30.917 --> 23:33.583
Yeah. Goose.

23:33.583 --> 23:35.875
Doesn't Goose die?

23:37.291 --> 23:38.625
[sighs]

23:38.625 --> 23:44.083
Whoa! That's big. But, I mean,
she'll grow into it. Thanks!

23:44.083 --> 23:47.583
Yeah. I don't
really do babies.

23:47.583 --> 23:50.083
You know,
that used to be my line.

23:51.750 --> 23:53.208
Wonder where Brian is?

23:53.208 --> 23:55.125
I don't know.
He's supposed to be here.

23:55.125 --> 23:57.959
Well, sit.
Really. It doesn't matter.

23:57.959 --> 24:01.834
I'm just glad to finally
get a chance meet you.

24:01.834 --> 24:05.750
Yeah, you too. So, is this your
version of videotaping the baby?

24:05.750 --> 24:08.834
Oh, no. They're here to
photograph Deena's cupcakes.

24:08.834 --> 24:11.333
- These are beautiful.
- Could you just not...

24:11.333 --> 24:14.625
- Sorry.
They're for the photographs.
- That's fine.

24:14.625 --> 24:19.333
Um, you know,
Brian was here earlier
and I have to say

24:19.333 --> 24:22.166
I have you to blame
for that perma-grin on his face.

24:22.166 --> 24:25.000
That's sweet. I mean,
he's really excited about Bella.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.166
I think it's
a little bit more than Bella.

24:27.166 --> 24:31.041
Yeah. I mean, things seem to be
going really well for you two,

24:31.041 --> 24:35.375
and I'm so happy because,
boy, after that Marjorie fiasco,

24:35.375 --> 24:37.792
I was worried that he
would never find anyone

24:37.792 --> 24:40.917
that he even cared for again,
you know?

24:40.917 --> 24:45.166
Marjorie fiasco?
What Marjorie fiasco?

24:47.500 --> 24:48.667
Want a cupcake?

24:50.041 --> 24:53.625
Hey, you guys.
How's it going?

24:53.625 --> 24:56.458
- Good. It was good.
- Good.

24:56.458 --> 24:59.750
- I need to talk
to you about Carrie.
- Yeah. What's up?

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
Carrie?

25:04.250 --> 25:05.792
Carrie!

25:07.250 --> 25:08.917
Carrie!

25:10.959 --> 25:13.166
I don't think
she can hear me, Dave.

25:15.083 --> 25:18.542
- I think there's
something wrong.
- What?

25:26.208 --> 25:28.375
Just like that.
Gorgeous. Don't move.

25:28.375 --> 25:31.041
Right like that.
Awesome. Beautiful.

25:31.041 --> 25:34.875
Look at you, so sweet!
God, you are hot!

25:34.875 --> 25:38.667
Hot stuff! Hot stuff!
Nice! Right there.

25:38.667 --> 25:41.333
Hold it. Beautiful.

25:41.333 --> 25:43.250
I know my daughter
likes graham crackers.

25:43.250 --> 25:46.458
I don't need to be told that.
It is just totally infuriating.

25:46.458 --> 25:49.166
Dave's going to meet
and date other people.

25:49.166 --> 25:52.125
- He's going to try to move on.
- He can move on all he wants,

25:52.125 --> 25:54.709
not shove his new girlfriend
down my kids' throats.

25:54.709 --> 25:55.709
- No, don't?
- Oh!

25:56.792 --> 25:59.834
What? Oh, I'm sorry.

25:59.834 --> 26:02.375
- Damn it! It's Dave!
- [cell phone rings]

26:02.375 --> 26:05.500
- We're going
to need another cupcake!
- Speak of the devil.

26:08.417 --> 26:11.250
Hello, Dave. I cannot speak
to you right now, I'm sorry.

26:11.250 --> 26:13.166
I'm in the middle
of my photo shoot...

26:13.166 --> 26:15.375
- [Nic laughs]
- [Deena] Um...

26:16.667 --> 26:20.792
No, yeah.
I'll be right there. OK.

26:20.792 --> 26:24.291
- What's wrong?
- I don't know, honey,
but I have to go.

26:24.291 --> 26:27.250
- Deena, no. You can't leave.
- Nic, it's Carrie, OK?

26:27.250 --> 26:29.625
Please, just, um,
fill in for me.

26:29.625 --> 26:32.625
I'll, um...
I'll call you later, OK?

26:34.125 --> 26:36.792
- [doorbell]
- Hey.

26:38.667 --> 26:40.542
Sorry I didn't
make it to Nicole's.

26:40.542 --> 26:43.291
The buyer had a million
questions about the house.

26:44.166 --> 26:45.709
Where's your bag?

26:45.709 --> 26:48.458
It's at home.
I'm not staying here tonight.

26:48.458 --> 26:50.792
[laughs] Why not?

26:50.792 --> 26:55.959
Sorry you didn't make it
to Nicole's. We had
a nice talk about Marjorie.

26:58.333 --> 27:02.750
- I can explain.
- Now you can explain?

27:02.750 --> 27:07.458
What about the other day
when we were talking
about that sort of thing?

27:07.458 --> 27:10.125
You know, technically,
Marjorie isn't my ex.

27:10.125 --> 27:13.250
Don't even start, Brian.
You broke up a wedding
for the girl

27:13.250 --> 27:15.917
and you didn't say a word
to me about it.

27:15.917 --> 27:18.792
Am I a placeholder?
Are you waiting
for her to get back?

27:18.792 --> 27:21.000
Is that why you
didn't say anything?

27:21.000 --> 27:23.709
No. Of course not.

27:23.709 --> 27:27.583
If she was to walk
through the door right now,
what would you do?

27:27.583 --> 27:31.959
How would I know you don't
want her? How would you know?

27:33.500 --> 27:35.834
[sighs]

27:36.959 --> 27:39.542
[scoffs]

27:39.542 --> 27:41.458
[soft rock plays]

27:43.792 --> 27:46.333
[door opens]

27:47.875 --> 27:49.583
[door closes]

27:51.583 --> 27:55.500
- Thanks for seeing us so late,
doctor.
- I know this must be stressful.

27:55.500 --> 27:58.500
And I'm sorry to tell you,
you were right to be concerned.

27:58.500 --> 28:00.375
What is it?

28:00.375 --> 28:03.125
Carrie is suffering
from a severe and
permanent hearing loss

28:03.125 --> 28:07.041
due to irreversible damage
to her inner ear.
Specifically, the cochlea.

28:07.041 --> 28:10.500
So, what are you saying?
That our daughter's deaf?

28:10.500 --> 28:12.375
She does have
some residual hearing.

28:12.375 --> 28:17.375
Like how much? Can she hear us
when we talk to her?

28:17.375 --> 28:22.542
- No, I'm sorry, she can't.
- [Carrie coos]

28:22.542 --> 28:24.000
What can she hear?

28:24.000 --> 28:27.709
Normal speech occurs
up to the 60 decibel range.

28:27.709 --> 28:32.458
Carrie hears at 90 decibels
and above. Mostly loud
mechanical sounds.

28:32.458 --> 28:36.375
How is this possible?
They tested her hearing
when she was born.

28:36.375 --> 28:40.458
It probably came on
within the last month or so,
but we can't be sure.

28:40.458 --> 28:44.583
The only possible cause
is that she's had
several ear infections.

28:44.583 --> 28:47.542
But there may never be
an explanation.

28:47.542 --> 28:50.458
- [coos]
- I just can't believe this.

28:50.458 --> 28:53.125
You should bring her back
tomorrow for more tests.

28:53.125 --> 28:55.375
And I'm sure you have
a lot of questions.

28:55.375 --> 28:58.375
This is a list of pediatricians
in Los Angeles

28:58.375 --> 29:00.917
who work these types
of cases with me...

29:00.917 --> 29:03.583
- [soft rock plays]
- âª Whether you fall âª

29:06.709 --> 29:10.041
âª Means nothing at all âª

29:13.125 --> 29:18.208
âª It's whether you get up âª

29:20.125 --> 29:24.500
âª It's whether you get up âªâª

29:24.500 --> 29:27.917
All right. Let's do this.

29:27.917 --> 29:31.458
- I still can't
believe you talked me...
- Yeah, yeah. I owe you one.

29:31.458 --> 29:33.041
- Just one?
- Hey, look...

29:33.041 --> 29:36.041
The guy's got no priors.
I did a criminal records check.

29:36.041 --> 29:38.458
Yeah, that just means
he hasn't been caught.

29:38.458 --> 29:41.458
All right. 5303. This is it.

29:41.458 --> 29:44.834
- Remember: Goose and Maverick.
- Goose and Maverick.

29:46.500 --> 29:49.125
- Are you Schmitty?
- Who the hell are you?

29:50.333 --> 29:52.333
- OK.
- Hello, Schmitty.

29:52.333 --> 29:55.875
Look, I'm calling the cops
if you don't leave right now.

29:55.875 --> 29:59.500
Yeah. Go ahead. And you can tell
them how you stole my plasma.

29:59.500 --> 30:03.542
- So, where is it?
- I have no idea
what you're talking about.

30:03.542 --> 30:05.500
No? No idea?

30:05.500 --> 30:08.625
I hear you got a thing
for my wife. You got
an idea about that?

30:09.500 --> 30:10.959
You're Summer's husband?

30:10.959 --> 30:14.041
Yo, Adam,
isn't this your tie?

30:14.041 --> 30:15.375
You stole my tie?

30:17.500 --> 30:20.000
- It's a nice tie.
- What's the matter with you?

30:20.000 --> 30:22.542
- Why didn't Summer come?
- Is that what
this is all about?

30:22.542 --> 30:24.834
You just try
to get her attention?

30:24.834 --> 30:30.000
She made promises, OK?
We had... something

30:30.000 --> 30:32.625
and she said that we were
going to be together.

30:32.625 --> 30:35.125
So sue her.
People make promises.

30:35.125 --> 30:37.625
She was a stripper.
People lie. People move on.

30:37.625 --> 30:39.917
You don't see me
stealing your lounge chair

30:39.917 --> 30:43.792
- because a girl
left me at the altar.
- TV's not here, man.

30:43.792 --> 30:46.542
Look, I want my TV back.

30:46.542 --> 30:49.625
And you know where it's at
because I got my tie
to prove it.

30:49.625 --> 30:53.041
So unless you want me
to call the cops,
you better make it happen.

30:54.959 --> 30:56.291
Yeah.

31:04.166 --> 31:07.625
[deep breath, exhales]

31:07.625 --> 31:08.834
Everybody's asleep.

31:11.417 --> 31:13.750
So I guess I better get going.

31:13.750 --> 31:15.667
We're going
to get through this.

31:15.667 --> 31:18.291
It's not going to be easy,
but we're going to do it.

31:22.417 --> 31:24.667
- All right. Night.
- Night.

31:26.083 --> 31:27.709
Dave, how did
we miss this, huh?

31:28.792 --> 31:30.792
I gave her the ear medication.

31:30.792 --> 31:32.583
Do you think that was it?

31:32.583 --> 31:35.458
I don't know, Deen.
I don't know.

31:35.458 --> 31:38.667
All of this
in and out of the house,

31:38.667 --> 31:43.250
because we thought it
was best for the girls.
Who are we kidding, huh?

31:43.250 --> 31:46.959
- We weren't paying
enough attention.
- We're doing the best we can.

31:46.959 --> 31:49.125
You can't beat
yourself up about this.

31:49.125 --> 31:52.125
Don't tell me what to do.
This is my child
we're talking about.

31:52.125 --> 31:53.792
She's my child, too, OK?

31:53.792 --> 31:57.250
I'm just saying that we
have to be focused.
We have to stay calm.

31:59.041 --> 32:03.000
[sighs] One of our
children can't hear.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.792
And neither one
of us noticed?

32:06.125 --> 32:09.458
And you want me to be calm?

32:09.458 --> 32:12.291
This is just what you do.
This is always what you do.

32:12.291 --> 32:15.333
You just pretend like everything
is going to be fine.

32:15.333 --> 32:18.959
And it's not fine, Dave.
It is not fine.

32:18.959 --> 32:20.417
So you're blaming me now?

32:20.417 --> 32:23.959
You think I don't know
that everything's changed?
'Cause I do.

32:23.959 --> 32:27.750
I know that just because
we switch houses and get
the girls off for school

32:27.750 --> 32:30.291
that it doesn't mean
everything is fine, Deen.

32:30.291 --> 32:34.041
What do you think?
Do you think I like seeing my
girls six hours a week?

32:34.041 --> 32:35.667
Because I don't. I hate it.

32:35.667 --> 32:39.500
You spend most of the time
with them. So if anyone
should have noticed,

32:39.500 --> 32:40.500
it's you.

32:51.583 --> 32:54.333
[Dave] Hello?

32:54.333 --> 32:56.417
Anyone?

32:57.959 --> 32:59.875
[children's voices]

32:59.875 --> 33:02.500
[rock ballad plays]

33:02.500 --> 33:06.959
âª And they're tumbling
through my head âª

33:06.959 --> 33:09.000
[seagulls cry]

33:09.000 --> 33:12.667
Peace muffin?
Blueberry-peach, your favorite.

33:14.834 --> 33:16.500
Thanks.

33:19.166 --> 33:20.709
Where are the girls?

33:20.709 --> 33:22.208
Maria took them to the park.

33:25.291 --> 33:29.625
I'm sorry for all the crap
that I said last night.
You know, I just...

33:29.625 --> 33:32.500
- It's just this whole thing...
- It's OK.

33:33.834 --> 33:35.500
I'm sorry, too.

33:38.375 --> 33:43.542
With Geneva, Larissa, you know,
we were there all the time.

33:43.542 --> 33:46.375
You were home. I could work
at home if I needed to.

33:46.375 --> 33:49.417
- With Carrie, it's...
- That's not why she's deaf,
Dave.

33:51.333 --> 33:53.166
It's no one's fault.

33:56.500 --> 34:00.542
Look, the thing is,
I know that we're not together,

34:00.542 --> 34:04.000
but we're going to have
to go through this together.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.917
I think we should be
on the same side. I mean,
whatever's best for Carrie.

34:09.041 --> 34:10.041
OK.

34:19.375 --> 34:21.542
- [Bella coos]
- [both laugh]

34:21.542 --> 34:24.583
- I want to have kids.
- You will.

34:24.583 --> 34:26.125
Bridget and I got into a fight.

34:26.125 --> 34:28.917
- What did you do?
- Well, it was sort of
what you did.

34:28.917 --> 34:32.542
- You told Bridget
about Marjorie.
- You said you had the talk.

34:32.542 --> 34:34.709
I didn't really
elaborate on Marjorie.

34:34.709 --> 34:37.250
And then when Bridget
brought it up, I...

34:37.250 --> 34:40.709
It's freaking me out
because I thought
I saw her the other night.

34:40.709 --> 34:42.250
- Who?
- Marjorie.

34:42.250 --> 34:45.625
- She's in Minnesota.
- I know, but...

34:45.625 --> 34:47.792
[sighs] ...it was so real.

34:47.792 --> 34:52.083
Brian, Marjorie is not here.
Bridget is. OK?

34:52.083 --> 34:55.792
Don't screw up something
that's real for something
that's not real.

34:55.792 --> 34:57.792
Something that
was never real.

34:57.792 --> 35:01.959
You... You made your play.
You held out your hand.

35:01.959 --> 35:05.667
- And she said no. I get it.
- Yeah. So it's OK to move on.

35:05.667 --> 35:09.875
You don't have to bash your head
against the wall expecting a
different answer.

35:09.875 --> 35:14.250
Especially when someone
so great is standing right
next to you, saying yes.

35:16.625 --> 35:18.125
- OK?
- OK.

35:18.125 --> 35:20.750
Can I just hang out
with Bella, please?

35:22.041 --> 35:27.375
- [whispers] You're
so beautiful. Hi, baby.
- Oh.

35:27.375 --> 35:31.041
Randy Moss, a lot of talent.
I think best means most
productive.

35:31.041 --> 35:34.917
The guy that you can count
on the most. If I was going
for a two receiver...

35:37.208 --> 35:38.500
You want to go for a run?

35:38.500 --> 35:42.125
- Yeah, in like 20 minutes.
- Sure.

35:42.125 --> 35:45.667
- See, you're getting
used to it.
- [sarcastic chuckle]

35:45.667 --> 35:47.875
- [doorbell]
- I got it.

35:51.458 --> 35:53.000
Can I help you?

35:53.000 --> 35:55.792
- Yeah. Is this
the Hillman residence?
- Yes, it is.

35:55.792 --> 35:58.959
I got a flat-screen TV for you.
I'll be right back.

36:01.125 --> 36:02.792
Did you order a new flat screen?

36:02.792 --> 36:06.208
No, but I did have a talk
with Schmitty yesterday.

36:06.208 --> 36:07.750
- What?
- Yeah.

36:07.750 --> 36:09.709
How did you find him?
What did he say?

36:09.709 --> 36:13.542
Hey, none of that matters, baby.
What matters is he
got the message.

36:13.542 --> 36:17.333
He just needed someone
to lay down the law,
if you know what I'm saying.

36:17.333 --> 36:21.041
So, we'll just go
through the garage.
Oh, are you Heather Hillman?

36:21.041 --> 36:23.250
- Yeah.
- Yeah, this is for you.

36:23.250 --> 36:25.709
I'm supposed to give this
to you personally.

36:28.375 --> 36:30.583
What the hell is this?

36:30.583 --> 36:32.333
- It's a summons.
- A what?

36:32.333 --> 36:37.542
- A summons... He's suing you?
- For a hundred
thousand dollars?

36:37.542 --> 36:40.875
For fraudulent inducement,
breach of contract,

36:40.875 --> 36:44.333
and intentional infliction
of emotional distress?

36:44.333 --> 36:48.542
What does this even mean?
Can he sue me for this?

36:48.542 --> 36:52.750
You bring me a muffin,
I give you a cupcake.

36:52.750 --> 36:55.750
- Well, at least
I paid for mine.
- Funny.

36:57.208 --> 36:59.917
So, I made doctors'
appointments for the girls.

36:59.917 --> 37:01.917
I want everyone
checked out.

37:01.917 --> 37:04.083
Good. That's a good idea.

37:04.083 --> 37:08.208
Yeah, I just...
I want to do something
about this now, you know?

37:08.208 --> 37:11.333
I hate just sitting around.
It's just terrible.

37:11.333 --> 37:12.917
Yeah, I know, I know.

37:12.917 --> 37:16.709
We should figure out
which pediatrician
we want to call on the list.

37:16.709 --> 37:18.709
See if they can't talk us
through this.

37:18.709 --> 37:21.417
Jeez, I know. Look at this.

37:21.417 --> 37:24.291
I need a doctor to help me
pick a doctor. I can't...

37:24.291 --> 37:25.625
No kidding.

37:27.083 --> 37:31.291
Oh, that can't be right.
No, this must be an old list.

37:31.291 --> 37:34.583
Let me see.
No, it was printed last week.

37:34.583 --> 37:36.125
Well, look at that.

37:36.125 --> 37:39.792
Dr. Marjorie Seaver.
Working in Santa Monica?

37:41.458 --> 37:42.875
That can't be right.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.458
[knocking]

38:01.208 --> 38:04.834
I didn't cancel dinner
with Adam and Heather.
I still want us to go.

38:04.834 --> 38:07.208
Dave and Deena
used to go there all the time.

38:07.208 --> 38:09.709
It's some restaurant
right here by the beach.

38:09.709 --> 38:13.583
Your duffel bag means
you think you're spending
the night here, too?

38:13.583 --> 38:16.166
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about Marjorie.

38:16.166 --> 38:18.375
- It's not what you think.
- What is it, then?

38:18.375 --> 38:22.417
All the stuff that happened.
Everything I did makes me look
like... an idiot.

38:22.417 --> 38:24.709
I didn't want you
to think of me as an idiot.

38:24.709 --> 38:27.959
- Well, it's a little
too late for that.
- Yeah, I know. I...

38:27.959 --> 38:30.792
I was afraid I'd mess things up
if I told you the truth.

38:30.792 --> 38:33.041
And you messed up
by not telling me the truth.

38:33.041 --> 38:35.041
Pretty much...

38:35.041 --> 38:38.000
...but that's over with.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.709
You know everything
and Marjorie doesn't matter

38:40.709 --> 38:44.834
because right now the only thing
I care about is you and me.

38:52.083 --> 38:54.125
I guess I better go change.

38:58.500 --> 39:00.250
I'll come help you.

39:10.083 --> 39:12.542
- Hi!
- Hi.

39:12.542 --> 39:14.917
Wow. I can't
believe you're here.

39:14.917 --> 39:19.000
- It's so good to see you.
- Yeah.
What have you been doing?

39:19.000 --> 39:21.792
- I have a lot
of questions for you.
- I'm sure you do.

39:21.792 --> 39:24.208
But first...

39:24.208 --> 39:27.458
...I want to hear about Carrie.

39:30.542 --> 39:33.542
- Did you talk to his lawyer?
- Yeah, I left him a message.

39:33.542 --> 39:35.625
- What are we going to do?
- Just relax.

39:35.625 --> 39:40.208
We're going to make it
all go away. It's just
a bluff for money.

39:40.208 --> 39:43.208
The guy's got no case, right?
He's just a customer.

39:43.208 --> 39:45.041
Yeah. He was just a customer.

39:45.041 --> 39:48.542
Did he really give you
all that money for lap dances?

39:48.542 --> 39:51.792
I don't know. Maybe.

39:51.792 --> 39:54.041
I never should've
said anything to you.

39:54.041 --> 39:57.417
- I would've noticed the TV.
- I didn't have
to say that it was him.

39:57.417 --> 39:59.583
Let's just not talk
about it anymore.

39:59.583 --> 40:02.750
Brian and Bridget
don't need to know
anything else about Schmitty.

40:02.750 --> 40:05.750
No one needs to know
anything else about Schmitty.

40:05.750 --> 40:08.041
Let's just go have
a nice, relaxing dinner.

40:08.041 --> 40:11.083
- Where are we going anyway?
- Some place that Brian picked.

40:13.583 --> 40:16.583
These doctors just throw
these words at you.

40:16.583 --> 40:21.875
And all you can think is,
"this is my daughter they're
talking about,"

40:21.875 --> 40:24.458
and I can't understand
anything they're saying.

40:24.458 --> 40:27.792
Deena, everything
is going to be fine, OK?

40:27.792 --> 40:29.792
Carrie's not
in any danger right now.

40:29.792 --> 40:32.083
And I'll be here
to talk you through all of it.

40:32.083 --> 40:35.083
I'll get you all the help you
need and I'm not going anywhere.

40:35.083 --> 40:38.625
- Thank you. Thank you.
- I'm just glad that I can help.

40:40.125 --> 40:42.417
So, can I start
asking questions now?

40:44.208 --> 40:46.041
You don't have to. Um...

40:46.041 --> 40:48.291
Let's see. I hated Minnesota.

40:48.291 --> 40:51.709
It was cold... and lonely,

40:51.709 --> 40:55.625
and after I finished my first
rotation in the hospital,

40:55.625 --> 40:59.834
- I put in to move back.
- And you didn't
contact any of us?

40:59.834 --> 41:02.458
I couldn't.

41:02.458 --> 41:06.000
I had a lot to work through
after what happened.

41:06.000 --> 41:10.750
And I wasn't ready to see
everyone. And I'm still not.

41:10.750 --> 41:13.792
I wasn't sure how everyone
would feel about seeing me.

41:13.792 --> 41:17.125
Well, I think it would be OK.
I really do.

41:17.917 --> 41:19.375
I don't know.

41:19.375 --> 41:21.417
Well, thank you
for meeting me here.

41:21.417 --> 41:26.125
I didn't want the first time
we saw each other to be
in the doctor's office.

41:26.125 --> 41:30.458
And if you don't want to see
the gang, that's fine with me.
I'll do whatever you want...

41:30.458 --> 41:34.834
Yeah, maybe we could
not tell anyone else
that I'm back in town just yet.

41:44.834 --> 41:47.542
I didn't have anything to do
with this, honey. I swear, I...

41:47.542 --> 41:49.959
