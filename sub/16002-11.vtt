[Brian] Previously on
What About Brian:

00:01.875 --> 00:04.208
- In a perfect world,
we'd be together.
- What's your problem?

00:04.208 --> 00:05.959
You had an affair
with my father.

00:05.959 --> 00:08.542
Why is it such a big deal
that I'm 20 years old?

00:08.542 --> 00:12.458
I should be the one freaking out
that you're divorced
with three kids.

00:12.458 --> 00:16.917
- She's so beautiful.
- That's what we'll call her.
Bella.

00:16.917 --> 00:19.125
I don't want people
looking at my wife.

00:19.125 --> 00:20.917
I quit.
Tonight's my last night.

00:20.917 --> 00:22.625
We're in this forever.

00:29.959 --> 00:33.500
Last hole, ladies.
This one's for all the marbles.

00:33.500 --> 00:37.333
When Brian and I win
a dinner bet,
we really like to chow down.

00:37.333 --> 00:39.875
Chow down all you want.
You'll be paying for it.

00:39.875 --> 00:41.583
All right. Brian, you're up.

00:42.709 --> 00:44.625
Long putt there, buddy.

00:44.625 --> 00:48.458
So is it, uh, weird? Dating
somebody's who dated your dad?

00:48.458 --> 00:50.625
You waited 18 holes
to use that one on me?

00:50.625 --> 00:52.417
Think you can rattle me
with that?

00:52.417 --> 00:55.417
I was just wondering
if you've had the ex talk.

00:55.417 --> 00:59.417
How many she's been with,
who she's been with, like...
your dad!

00:59.417 --> 01:02.625
Of course that would be awkward,
don't you think, Jimmy?

01:02.625 --> 01:05.417
- [Jimmy] It's
got to be awkward.
- Just slightly.

01:05.417 --> 01:08.208
- I have nerves of steel.
- [Dave] Come on, steel nerves.

01:08.208 --> 01:10.709
- Oh! Oh!
- That might...
That might work, Bri!

01:10.709 --> 01:12.792
Oh, too bad.

01:12.792 --> 01:16.083
- So close! Keep that chin up.
- Guess he didn't have the talk.

01:16.083 --> 01:18.792
We don't need the talk, Jimmy.
Just putt.

01:18.792 --> 01:23.417
- OK. Big Jim.
Taking some swings.
- Love it when you call me that.

01:23.417 --> 01:26.959
- [Dave] You and Ivy
have had the talk?
- What, are you kidding me?

01:26.959 --> 01:30.166
- Had it on the first date.
- How many she been
with since then?

01:30.166 --> 01:31.959
- [Jimmy gags]
- [guys] Oh!

01:31.959 --> 01:33.917
[Dave] That's rough.
You got wobbly.

01:33.917 --> 01:36.458
[Adam] You should try
putting left-handed.

01:36.458 --> 01:38.041
All right. Let me hear it.

01:38.041 --> 01:42.583
I'm seeing a 20-year-old.
I could be her daddy.

01:42.583 --> 01:44.709
She lives with her parents,
blah, blah.

01:44.709 --> 01:48.333
That pretty much covers it.
I mean, as long
as you know she really is 20.

01:48.333 --> 01:50.250
She could be lying.

01:50.250 --> 01:52.792
- Jail bait!
- Wow.

01:52.792 --> 01:56.375
Oh, well, you know what?
You should ask her
for ID on the next date.

01:56.375 --> 01:58.000
- Whatever.
- All right, boys.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.291
Thanks, pal.
You're a real good buddy.

02:00.291 --> 02:04.625
Watch and observe
as Jimmy and I win the bet.

02:04.625 --> 02:05.834
Be the ball, baby.

02:05.834 --> 02:08.291
Hey, you're married
to a stripper...

02:08.291 --> 02:09.458
Out of bounds.

02:09.458 --> 02:11.166
You ask how many
she's been with?

02:11.166 --> 02:14.125
I adhere to the strict policy
of don't ask, don't tell.

02:14.125 --> 02:16.291
And it's seems
to be working out...

02:16.291 --> 02:18.667
...just fine.

02:18.667 --> 02:22.375
- [Adam, Jimmy cheering]
- That's my boy! That's my boy!

02:22.375 --> 02:25.583
I'm telling you this right now,
no champagne this time.

02:25.583 --> 02:26.834
We'll see about that.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.500
- [Dave] Good morning!
- [Deena] Hey!

02:32.500 --> 02:35.917
- These were in my car.
- I've been looking for those.
Thanks.

02:35.917 --> 02:38.417
Girls! Daddy's here
to take you to school!

02:38.417 --> 02:41.917
So, what's been going on?
I haven't had a chance
to really talk lately.

02:41.917 --> 02:45.000
Um... Everything's good.
[chuckles]

02:46.834 --> 02:49.792
I've been thinking about
selling some of my cupcakes

02:49.792 --> 02:52.542
at more of the farmers' markets
in the afternoons,

02:52.542 --> 02:55.333
but I think I need
a little extra help
with the girls.

02:55.333 --> 02:58.834
Well, you know what?
KC Gaming just started
their daycare program.

02:58.834 --> 03:01.834
- Maybe we could use that.
- Yeah, that could work.

03:01.834 --> 03:05.709
I mean, you should know
that Roxanne,

03:05.709 --> 03:07.875
- Sandwich Girl, would be there.
- Oh.

03:07.875 --> 03:11.917
Nobody was buying her sandwiches
except for me, so I got her
the job.

03:11.917 --> 03:16.041
Oh, right. I thought
she was actually in daycare.

03:16.041 --> 03:19.417
- [both laughing]
- [girls] Daddy! Daddy!

03:19.417 --> 03:23.959
There they are,
my sweet pumpkins!
Pumpkin One and Pumpkin Two.

03:23.959 --> 03:26.166
[sighs] So,
what are you doing today?

03:26.166 --> 03:30.125
I'm going over to Nicole's,
so that I can see Bella.

03:30.125 --> 03:34.083
And I'm going to give her
some of the baby stuff
that we don't use anymore.

03:34.083 --> 03:36.667
Make sure you charge her for it.
There you go.

03:36.667 --> 03:40.542
All right, Jenny's mom
is taking you and Jenny
to ballet after school.

03:40.542 --> 03:42.917
And am I going to Pam's house
after school?

03:42.917 --> 03:44.792
Yes, you are
going to Pam's house.

03:44.792 --> 03:48.166
Come on, we're going to be late.
Get into the car.

03:48.166 --> 03:51.041
- So, we pretty much
got this down.
- Yep, we do.

03:55.583 --> 04:00.667
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry!
Come on, hon! Oh!

04:04.250 --> 04:07.083
Are we going to spend the night
at your place or mine?

04:07.083 --> 04:10.291
- I vote mine. It's easier.
- Yeah, easier for you.

04:10.291 --> 04:11.959
All your stuff is there.

04:11.959 --> 04:16.291
I have to pack an overnight bag,
again. So how about
tomorrow night?

04:16.291 --> 04:18.458
I'm going out with the guys
tomorrow night.

04:18.458 --> 04:20.917
When do I get to go out
with you and your friends?

04:22.417 --> 04:25.750
What if I set up something
with Adam and Heather?

04:25.750 --> 04:28.000
You know, like a double date.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.291
That sounds fun.
Very Brady Bunch.

04:31.291 --> 04:33.625
So, you like The Brady Bunch?

04:33.625 --> 04:36.625
What? There's still a lot
I don't know about you.

04:36.625 --> 04:39.417
Like, how old are you?
How long you've lived in L.A.?

04:39.417 --> 04:44.083
How many guys you've slept with?
If you like The Brady Bunch?

04:44.083 --> 04:46.417
That was the worst segue
I've ever heard.

04:46.417 --> 04:49.875
- I know. I'm sorry.
- Thirty-six.

04:51.875 --> 04:54.125
You've had sex
with 36 different guys?

04:54.125 --> 04:55.667
That's my age, Brian.

04:55.667 --> 04:58.667
Look, I don't care
how many guys you've slept with.

04:58.667 --> 05:02.583
It's the relationship
that counts. That's what
we should talk about.

05:02.583 --> 05:05.375
The two or three guys
who really meant something.

05:05.375 --> 05:08.375
- And you want to do this now?
- Sure. We have time to kill.

05:08.375 --> 05:11.500
OK. Um, let's see,
there's Gary,

05:11.500 --> 05:15.083
he was my college boyfriend
who was actually my fiancé,

05:15.083 --> 05:16.709
until it kind of fell apart.

05:16.709 --> 05:20.500
And then there was Tom,
who I thought was a perfect guy

05:20.500 --> 05:24.041
until he told me that
he lost his virginity
to his second cousin.

05:24.041 --> 05:26.041
Yeah, pretty gross.

05:26.041 --> 05:29.333
Then there was Charlie,
who my parents adored,

05:29.333 --> 05:31.709
which made me not adore him.

05:31.709 --> 05:33.583
Who was after Charlie?

05:34.875 --> 05:38.458
Nick! Nick is after Charlie.

05:40.250 --> 05:45.542
Shh. Wait. She's sleeping. OK.
Good. Those are sneakers.

05:45.542 --> 05:47.875
Because I never knew
how loud shoes were.

05:49.917 --> 05:53.000
Whoever invented hardwood floors
never had kids.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.875
Sweetie, you don't have
to whisper. The baby's room
is all the way in the...

05:56.875 --> 05:58.875
OK.

05:58.875 --> 06:00.542
She doesn't like the nursery.

06:00.542 --> 06:02.375
I put her in,
she starts crying.

06:02.375 --> 06:06.834
- The stuffed animals scare her.
- Just take the
stuffed animals out.

06:06.834 --> 06:09.291
Oh, no. She loves it in here.

06:09.291 --> 06:12.750
I come here and breast-feed her
and she always falls asleep.

06:12.750 --> 06:16.125
I just roll over, and she's
sleeping so beautifully

06:16.125 --> 06:18.208
and then I sleep on the couch...

06:18.208 --> 06:21.083
I think she likes
the sound of the clock.

06:21.083 --> 06:24.792
Uh... Here's an idea,
just a thought.

06:26.125 --> 06:29.917
Maybe did you ever think
of moving the clock?

06:29.917 --> 06:33.875
I've gone crazy,
haven't I? I'm crazy.

06:33.875 --> 06:35.917
No, honey, you're not crazy...

06:35.917 --> 06:38.542
You don't know what it's like
to do this all alone.

06:38.542 --> 06:41.417
OK. Honey,
I'm just going to show you

06:41.417 --> 06:45.250
a little something
that worked for me.

06:45.250 --> 06:46.583
Trust me.

06:49.625 --> 06:51.208
All right.

06:51.208 --> 06:53.250
Grab the bassinet, sweetie.

06:53.250 --> 06:54.959
Get it. Go on.

07:04.458 --> 07:08.041
Just a little close to the bed.
It's OK. OK, now watch.

07:09.125 --> 07:10.458
Do it just...

07:10.458 --> 07:12.959
...like... that.

07:16.125 --> 07:18.834
And that is called
a double arm transfer.

07:18.834 --> 07:21.458
Dave taught me that one.

07:21.458 --> 07:24.125
A husband is the most
underrated person on earth.

07:24.125 --> 07:26.959
Even if he's just there
in the bed grunting,

07:26.959 --> 07:30.917
at least someone's there
to tell you it's all going
to be OK at 3:00am.

07:30.917 --> 07:34.291
[Bridget] And then after Josh,
I kind of threw myself
into my work

07:34.291 --> 07:38.583
- until I met, well...
he didn't count.
- We should, uh, get out front.

07:38.583 --> 07:41.959
- People will
be here any minute.
- Not so fast. It's your turn.

07:41.959 --> 07:44.625
We don't have time.
Yours took two hours.

07:44.625 --> 07:48.125
Oh, you're hilarious.
Just talk fast.

07:48.125 --> 07:51.583
There was Car Girl,
Traffic School Girl, the Lisas,

07:51.583 --> 07:53.125
and the Loud Talker.

07:53.125 --> 07:57.834
Those are even real names.
I want stories.
I gave you stories.

07:57.834 --> 07:59.959
[laughs] You know,
there are no stories.

07:59.959 --> 08:02.166
We dated, we broke up.
End of story.

08:02.166 --> 08:04.834
OK, who was
the last girl you kissed?

08:04.834 --> 08:06.834
Car Girl,
but that was part of a bet.

08:06.834 --> 08:11.166
I'm beginning to think
you have a little bit
of a gambling problem.

08:11.166 --> 08:14.750
Come on. Who was the last girl
that you kissed by choice?

08:15.875 --> 08:17.500
[exhales]

08:18.625 --> 08:22.166
I don't know.
I guess, um, Marjorie.

08:22.166 --> 08:24.208
And does Marjorie
have a nickname?

08:24.208 --> 08:28.333
Nope, just Marjorie.
We didn't actually date.
It was more of a...

08:28.333 --> 08:30.083
Sorry. Are we early?

08:30.083 --> 08:32.875
No! No, no.
Come on in. Come on in.

08:32.875 --> 08:36.875
You guys will take cash
for this place, won't you?

08:36.875 --> 08:39.291
Yeah! Absolutely.

08:42.917 --> 08:44.875
[slap]

08:44.875 --> 08:47.291
Oh! I got you a present.

08:47.291 --> 08:50.041
Sorry, it's not wrapped,
but...

08:50.041 --> 08:55.041
- [Nicole] Ooh!
- [Deena chuckles]

08:55.041 --> 08:59.500
They're nipple protectors.
They saved my life, so...

08:59.500 --> 09:02.250
Thanks, I think.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.709
Hey! I got you
a present too.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.250
Oh! A magazine. Wow.

09:09.250 --> 09:12.375
They run a column, the hottest
flower shops in L.A.,

09:12.375 --> 09:14.041
the hottest pancakes
in L.A...

09:14.041 --> 09:16.625
Oh, yeah. I've read that column.
It's never right.

09:16.625 --> 09:20.625
Not next month,
when they're going to say,
"The Hottest Cupcake in L.A."

09:20.625 --> 09:23.208
The hottest cupcake?
You didn't!

09:23.208 --> 09:26.792
I called them. I let them
put one of my bands
on their cover last year.

09:26.792 --> 09:30.041
It was the hottest selling issue
they ever had, so they owe me.

09:30.041 --> 09:33.500
So, right here,
in two nights,

09:33.500 --> 09:35.875
in this very house,

09:35.875 --> 09:39.625
they're going to shoot
a layout with the Hottest
Cupcake in L.A., Deena Greco.

09:39.625 --> 09:42.583
- I can't do that!
- Yes, you can.

09:42.583 --> 09:48.208
You are going to be the most
perfect, most photogenic
cupcake in all of L.A.

09:48.208 --> 09:50.834
Wow. Well, I guess I'm going
to have to get someone

09:50.834 --> 09:54.750
to watch the girls
so I can bake, but...

09:54.750 --> 09:58.125
- Thanks, Nic. Oh!
- Watch the boobs!

09:59.250 --> 10:01.625
I can't believe
I agreed to these pillows.

10:01.625 --> 10:05.667
- I mean,
could they be more flowery?
- Oh, they're just pillows.

10:05.667 --> 10:09.291
We can always take them back.
I just want to see
what they look like.

10:09.291 --> 10:11.500
As long as they're
on your side of the bed.

10:11.500 --> 10:15.625
Hey, I didn't complain
when you bought that gigantic...

10:15.625 --> 10:17.417
...television.

10:20.333 --> 10:22.959
Please tell me I'm not seeing
what I'm not seeing.

10:22.959 --> 10:24.875
You're seeing it. It's gone.

10:26.792 --> 10:29.166
I'll go see
if anything else is missing.

10:33.166 --> 10:36.166
Who steals a TV
and nothing else?

10:36.166 --> 10:38.375
[Heather] Some
of my clothes are missing.

10:38.375 --> 10:41.041
And my favorite pair of heels.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.834
What, were we
robbed by a pervert?

10:45.166 --> 10:46.500
What's this?

10:50.000 --> 10:52.333
- Oh, no.
- What?

10:52.333 --> 10:54.333
It's a dollar bill
shaped like an S.

10:54.333 --> 10:56.500
- So?
- So I think I know
who did this.

11:35.875 --> 11:38.500
And you think it
was this guy Schmitty?

11:38.500 --> 11:40.709
That's what we
called him at the club.

11:40.709 --> 11:43.709
He was very upset when he
found out that I was quitting.

11:43.709 --> 11:46.417
All based on this dollar bill
you found on the floor?

11:46.417 --> 11:49.667
It sounds crazy, but that's how
he used to tip me at the club,

11:49.667 --> 11:52.458
fold the dollar into an "S"
before he put it in my...

11:52.458 --> 11:56.083
- Heather, we get it.
- Oh! "S" was for Schmitty.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.250
Actually, "S" was for Summer.

11:58.250 --> 12:00.166
- What's Summer?
- My dancer name.

12:00.166 --> 12:03.750
- Can we talk about my TV?
- Your TV's probably long gone
by now.

12:03.750 --> 12:07.041
We'll talk to this Schmitty guy
when we get around to it.

12:07.041 --> 12:11.125
You can file a report
with the serial number
on the TV in case it turns up,

12:11.125 --> 12:13.291
but they usually
rub those off.

12:13.291 --> 12:16.750
- So that's it?
That's all I can do?
- What kind of TV was it?

12:16.750 --> 12:19.583
It was a 57-inch
hi-def LCD on a swivel.

12:19.583 --> 12:22.458
- [whistles] Those are
pretty sweet.
- Tell me about it.

12:22.458 --> 12:26.375
I'll let you know
if anything turns up,
but don't hold your breath.

12:26.375 --> 12:27.875
Good night.

12:31.166 --> 12:34.625
- [door closes]
- [sighs]

12:34.625 --> 12:38.291
So this, uh, Schmitty was your
boyfriend? Is that what this is?

12:38.291 --> 12:42.792
No. He just really liked me,
and he freaked out when I left.

12:42.792 --> 12:44.792
The girls said he
was asking where I went.

12:44.792 --> 12:46.291
Why? Did you lead him on,

12:46.291 --> 12:48.834
make him think you were
going to sleep with him?

12:48.834 --> 12:51.291
Of course I did.
That was my job.

12:51.291 --> 12:54.458
The guy paid for a lot
of lap dances, but it
wasn't a big deal.

12:54.458 --> 12:56.166
It's not a big deal?

12:56.166 --> 12:59.792
Some psychopath is
stalking you and he stole my TV
and it's not a big deal?

12:59.792 --> 13:02.000
- It's a big deal.
- The police will handle it.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.333
Why don't you give them
a list of all your exes

13:04.333 --> 13:07.959
- before my couches
start to disappear?
- He was not my ex!

13:11.333 --> 13:14.583
- This place is great!
- Yeah, pretty cool, huh?

13:16.125 --> 13:18.500
- And this is Carrie?
- Yeah, this is Carrie.

13:18.500 --> 13:21.500
She's adorable!
They're all adorable.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.625
Thank you for
helping me get this job.

13:23.625 --> 13:25.500
Are you kidding me?
Of course.

13:25.500 --> 13:29.166
I never knew I'd be meeting
your kids so soon.
This is a big step for us.

13:30.375 --> 13:32.458
I'm kidding, silly.

13:32.458 --> 13:35.041
- I knew that you were kidding.
- Yeah, right.

13:35.041 --> 13:36.667
OK, I got it from here.

13:36.667 --> 13:39.458
Yeah, you want to go over
and say hi to Roxanne?

13:39.458 --> 13:43.041
- Yeah. Good.
- [Carrie fusses]

13:43.041 --> 13:46.500
- All right, girls.
I'll see you soon.
- [girls] Bye, Daddy!

13:52.792 --> 13:56.208
[Brian] Oh, my God,
what did you do?

13:56.208 --> 13:58.250
I need you
to get rid of them, OK?

13:58.250 --> 14:01.375
Bri, just give them
to charity or something.

14:01.375 --> 14:03.750
I gave you this one.

14:03.750 --> 14:05.959
She doesn't like them.

14:05.959 --> 14:08.583
How do you know?

14:08.583 --> 14:13.208
OK, I don't like them.
They cause allergies
and they're scary.

14:13.208 --> 14:16.291
OK. I'll pack them in plastic
and put them in the garage.

14:16.291 --> 14:18.208
Some day Bella's
going to want them.

14:20.583 --> 14:22.375
- OK. Come.
- OK.

14:23.709 --> 14:26.875
[Brian laughs quietly]
She's so beautiful.

14:26.875 --> 14:29.041
She shouldn't wake up,
but if she does,

14:29.041 --> 14:31.542
give her your finger
to suck on until I get back.

14:31.542 --> 14:34.458
Make sure to wash your hands
really well with hot water.

14:34.458 --> 14:37.333
- What about a pacifier?
- I'm trying to avoid them.

14:37.333 --> 14:39.000
They're really bad
for the teeth.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.083
She doesn't have any teeth.
So I guess you don't want this?

14:43.083 --> 14:44.917
No. Just put that
with the animals.

14:45.875 --> 14:47.583
OK. I'm going
to go to the market.

14:48.750 --> 14:51.083
Wait. Are you sure?
Because I can go for you.

14:51.083 --> 14:54.583
Are you kidding? I haven't seen
the outside world in ten days.

14:54.583 --> 14:58.250
Nic, is it all right if Bridget
and I stop by tomorrow?

14:58.250 --> 15:01.583
I really...
I want you to meet her.

15:01.583 --> 15:04.417
Wow. It sounds like you guys
are getting pretty serious.

15:04.417 --> 15:07.250
Pretty serious, yeah.
We even had the exes talk.

15:07.250 --> 15:09.959
- Including Dad?
- We sort of skipped over that.

15:09.959 --> 15:13.083
- Oh. It's good
to see you happy.
- Yeah.

15:13.083 --> 15:16.250
- OK. I won't be long.
- Are you going to change first?

15:16.250 --> 15:19.375
- What's wrong with this?
- Nothing.

15:19.375 --> 15:23.375
I just wanted to make sure
you weren't going to change,
because you look fine.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.208
OK. OK.

15:26.792 --> 15:28.125
OK.

15:40.792 --> 15:41.792
How old?

15:44.041 --> 15:45.667
Thirty... something.

15:45.667 --> 15:49.417
- The baby?
- Oh, no.
Three and a half weeks.

15:49.417 --> 15:51.792
Well, no wonder you look
like a tornado hit you.

15:54.083 --> 15:57.291
- [Bella crying]
- It's nap-nap time.
It's nap-nap time.

15:57.291 --> 16:01.667
Yeah, look at Brian.
Look at Uncle Brian. [babbles]

16:01.667 --> 16:02.709
See this?

16:03.875 --> 16:07.166
[Bella still crying]

16:07.166 --> 16:11.667
No? OK, OK, OK.
Lay down. Lay down.

16:11.667 --> 16:17.667
Yeah. There you go. Come on,
Bella. Please, Bella, come on.

16:17.667 --> 16:21.875
OK. Pinkie time. Pinkie time.
There's the pinkie.

16:21.875 --> 16:23.834
No? OK.

16:25.500 --> 16:27.000
All right.

16:33.542 --> 16:35.625
[cooing]

16:36.625 --> 16:38.834
Don't tell your Mom.

16:38.834 --> 16:40.875
You keep that
in your sock drawer.

16:40.875 --> 16:44.208
That's where Uncle Bri used
to keep his contraband items.

16:44.208 --> 16:47.667
- [cooing]
- [sighs]

16:52.917 --> 16:55.250
[sighs]

16:55.250 --> 16:58.709
[Dave] OK, girls, show Mommy
what you got. Come on,
come on, come on...

16:58.709 --> 17:02.333
- It's sushi!
- Wow, that is sushi!

17:02.333 --> 17:06.000
It was Roxanne's idea.
You know, the girl
from Daddy's work?

17:06.000 --> 17:08.250
Wow, that was
really nice of her.

17:08.250 --> 17:10.834
- And she gave us more stuff...
- Easy, tigers.

17:10.834 --> 17:12.834
...so we can make
some for you, too.

17:12.834 --> 17:16.417
- Sounds like you guys
really liked her.
- We loved her. She's so nice.

17:16.417 --> 17:19.542
- And so pretty.
- And she does this funny...

17:19.542 --> 17:21.041
Uh-huh! Wow! OK.

17:21.041 --> 17:24.750
So, why don't you guys run on in
there and make Mommy some sushi?

17:24.750 --> 17:27.291
- [girls] OK!
- OK.

17:27.291 --> 17:29.583
You better wipe that smirk
off your face.

17:29.583 --> 17:32.750
What smirk? It wasn't a smirk.

17:32.750 --> 17:35.917
I was grimacing, angrily.

17:35.917 --> 17:39.709
I don't know what
your problem is.
You don't have to be jealous.

17:39.709 --> 17:43.166
Trust me, I'm not jealous.
I do know my girls
love me more than

17:43.166 --> 17:46.208
- your new girlfriend.
- Carrie!
She's not my girlfriend.

17:46.208 --> 17:48.250
We've been out
a couple of times.

17:48.250 --> 17:51.375
Listen, you don't have to make
me feel better, all right?

17:51.375 --> 17:55.583
I have nothing to prove.
I know that my girls
spend all day with Roxanne...

17:55.583 --> 17:57.208
- Carrie! Oh!
- Carrie!

17:57.208 --> 18:00.959
[Dave] Whoa! Whoa!
Carrie! Carrie! It's OK, honey.

18:00.959 --> 18:04.125
It's OK. Mommy, help get?
Are you OK, sweetheart?

18:04.125 --> 18:05.458
You all right, honey?

18:05.458 --> 18:10.542
Mommy, can we please have
Roxanne baby-sit every night?

18:10.542 --> 18:11.875
No.

18:15.959 --> 18:19.458
- I still don't get
why she's here.
- You think I invited her?

18:19.458 --> 18:21.792
This restaurant was my idea.

18:21.792 --> 18:24.625
I've been wanting to try
a new steak place. Get over it.

18:24.625 --> 18:27.750
- Your rib eye's
on a separate check.
- Fine with me.

18:27.750 --> 18:29.417
Can we please
get back to the TV?

18:29.417 --> 18:33.000
- Mmm. TV? What's up? It's gone?
- Yeah. History.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.083
You're letting this guy
get away with it?

18:35.083 --> 18:37.458
He's clearly
her ex-boyfriend.

18:37.458 --> 18:41.458
He's not her ex-boyfriend, OK?
He's just a former...

18:41.458 --> 18:43.333
A former customer.
I know, I know.

18:43.333 --> 18:46.333
But, see,
regular strip-club customers

18:46.333 --> 18:50.250
don't hunt down ex-strippers
and steal their stuff.
At least I don't think they do.

18:50.250 --> 18:52.333
Find this Schmitty,
show him who's boss.

18:52.333 --> 18:54.291
- Schmitty.
- You know what I'm saying?

18:54.291 --> 18:57.083
- Give him a bit
of the Hillman hell.
- Hillman hell?

18:57.083 --> 18:59.959
I'm trying, man.
Look what I have to work with.

18:59.959 --> 19:02.625
Speaking of exes,
you and Bridget have that talk?

19:02.625 --> 19:04.959
We did, and it went well.
Long, but well.

19:04.959 --> 19:07.875
- So you told her
about Marjorie?
- Whoa, whoa!

19:07.875 --> 19:11.333
- I still don't know
why she's here.
- Why would he say anything...

19:11.333 --> 19:15.041
Why would he say anything
about Marjorie?
She's my ex, not his.

19:15.041 --> 19:18.166
If you were dating Brian,
wouldn't you want
to know about Marjorie?

19:18.166 --> 19:22.500
If I were dating Brian,
I'd be thrilled because
then I'd still have my TV.

19:22.500 --> 19:24.834
There's a reason
you didn't tell Bridget.

19:26.583 --> 19:30.667
- This is ice-cold.
- Baby, no. No, no.

19:30.667 --> 19:34.333
I'm a member of the
service industry.
This is for their own good.

19:34.333 --> 19:38.667
She always does this.
They're going to spit in our
food. Don't order dessert.

19:38.667 --> 19:41.417
- Whoa! Where are you going?
- Left my wallet in my car.

19:41.417 --> 19:45.375
- I'll be right back.
- Nice! Sticking
Dave with the check.

19:45.375 --> 19:48.542
- What's up
with Dave and the check?
- Champagne, please.

20:07.375 --> 20:09.041
Marjorie?

20:13.000 --> 20:14.083
[Ivy] Hey.

20:14.083 --> 20:17.041
What, you trying to run out
on the check?

20:17.041 --> 20:18.417
Scared the crap out of me.

20:18.417 --> 20:21.542
- What's the matter?
- Nothing, nothing. I'm fine.

20:27.041 --> 20:28.875
But I think
I just saw Marjorie.

20:36.333 --> 20:41.125
It was Marjorie. She was
walking over there across
the street. I saw her.

20:41.125 --> 20:44.291
That makes perfect sense
because Marjorie is in Idaho.

20:44.291 --> 20:47.041
- Minnesota.
- Whatever, same thing.

20:47.041 --> 20:50.291
The point is, whoever you
think you saw, it wasn't her.

20:50.291 --> 20:52.417
Well, it looked
exactly like her.

20:52.417 --> 20:55.166
That is because you are seeing
through guilty eyes.

20:55.166 --> 20:58.083
You know, you should've
told Bridget and you didn't

20:58.083 --> 21:01.083
and now it's eating you up
and you're imagining things.

21:01.083 --> 21:03.834
Don't you think you would know
if Marjorie was here?

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
Maybe we shouldn't tell the guys
about this just yet, OK?

21:11.000 --> 21:13.291
Maybe you should pay
for my rib eye.

21:14.125 --> 21:16.625
It's all right. It's OK.

21:26.792 --> 21:30.166
Hi! Hi! There's my girl.

21:30.166 --> 21:34.125
- Hi, you must be Dave's...
Mrs. Greco?
- Yes, and you must be Roxanne.

21:34.125 --> 21:36.417
So nice to meet you.
Your kids are great.

21:36.417 --> 21:40.166
Thank you. I know.
Carrie, come to Mommy.
Come say hi, baby. Come on.

21:41.792 --> 21:45.959
OK. Um... How's she been doing?
She's been teething.

21:45.959 --> 21:48.333
She's good. I gave her
some graham crackers.

21:48.333 --> 21:50.583
She likes the way
it feels on her gums.

21:50.583 --> 21:52.917
There are graham crackers
right in this bag.

21:52.917 --> 21:54.667
I do know
what my children like.

21:54.667 --> 21:58.041
Sorry. I'm not trying to tell
you how to raise your daughter.

21:58.041 --> 22:00.959
OK. That's good. That's good.
That's nice. Here you go.

22:00.959 --> 22:02.917
- Just checking on my girl.
- Hi.

22:02.917 --> 22:06.375
This is awkward.
What are you doing here?
On your way to the Oscars?

22:06.375 --> 22:09.834
[laughs] Funny. No. I have
that photo shoot, remember,

22:09.834 --> 22:12.458
and I wanted to bring Carrie
her teething ring.

22:12.458 --> 22:15.625
- Can we talk for a sec? Alone?
- Sure. Excuse me.

22:17.208 --> 22:20.667
What are you doing? I mean,
really. Are you this insecure?

22:20.667 --> 22:24.542
- What's the big deal?
- This isn't a competition,
Deen. You're the mother.

22:24.542 --> 22:26.583
Carrie loves you
more than anybody else.

22:26.583 --> 22:27.709
- Oh, I know.
- OK.

22:27.709 --> 22:29.250
So don't come
in here looking hot

22:29.250 --> 22:31.250
and making
her feel like a slob.

22:31.250 --> 22:33.291
OK, for the record,
thank you.

22:33.291 --> 22:35.542
And, um, that's not
what I was trying to do.

22:35.542 --> 22:39.375
But I really got to get
going now, so, bye-bye, Dave.

22:39.375 --> 22:40.375
OK, bye-bye.

22:46.208 --> 22:49.583
All right, I called
the strip club,
pretending that I was a cop.

22:49.583 --> 22:52.875
I got his name, ran it through
the system. I got his address.

22:52.875 --> 22:54.875
It was easy.
So you're in, right?

22:54.875 --> 22:56.667
No. I am not in.

22:56.667 --> 22:59.000
Why not? It was your idea
in the first place.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.125
You don't know anything
about Schmitty.

23:01.125 --> 23:03.542
Are we going to walk in
and ask for the TV back?

23:03.542 --> 23:06.083
He could have a gun.
Jimmy don't do guns.

23:06.083 --> 23:07.250
He doesn't have a gun!

23:08.917 --> 23:12.000
Besides,
Heather says he's harmless.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.917

Brian was here earlier

24:19.333 --> 24:22.166
I have you to blame
for that perma-grin on his face.

24:22.166 --> 24:25.000

he's really excited about Bella.

a little bit more than Bella.

when we were talking
about that sort of thing?

You know, technically,
Marjorie isn't my ex.

27:10.125 --> 27:13.250
Don't even start, Brian.
You broke up a wedding
for the girl

27:13.250 --> 27:15.917

to me about it.

Are you waiting
for her to get back?

Is that why you
didn't say anything?

No. Of course not.

And I'm sorry to tell you,
you were right to be concerned.

27:58.500 --> 28:00.375
What is it?

28:00.375 --> 28:03.125
Carrie is suffering
from a severe and
permanent hearing loss

28:03.125 --> 28:07.041
due to irreversible damage
to her inner ear.
Specifically, the cochlea.

28:07.041 --> 28:10.500
So, what are you saying?
That our daughter's deaf?

28:10.500 --> 28:12.375
She does have
some residual hearing.

28:12.375 --> 28:17.375

when we talk to her?

28:17.375 --> 28:22.542

- [Carrie coos]

28:22.542 --> 28:24.000

28:24.000 --> 28:27.709
Normal speech occurs
up to the 60 decibel range.

28:27.709 --> 28:32.458
Carrie hears at 90 decibels
and above. Mostly loud
mechanical sounds.

28:32.458 --> 28:36.375
How is this possible?
They tested her hearing
when she was born.

28:36.375 --> 28:40.458
It probably came on
within the last month or so,
but we can't be sure.

28:40.458 --> 28:44.583
The only possible cause
is that she's had
several ear infections.

28:44.583 --> 28:47.542
But there may never be
an explanation.

You want to go for a run?

35:38.500 --> 35:42.125
- Yeah, in like 20 minutes.
- Sure.

35:42.125 --> 35:45.667
- See, you're getting
used to it.
- [sarcastic chuckle]

35:45.667 --> 35:47.875
- [doorbell]
- I got it.

35:51.458 --> 35:53.000
Can I help you?

35:53.000 --> 35:55.792
- Yeah. Is this
the Hillman residence?
- Yes, it is.

35:55.792 --> 35:58.959
I got a flat-screen TV for you.
I'll be right back.

36:01.125 --> 36:02.792
Did you order a new flat screen?

36:02.792 --> 36:06.208
No, but I did have a talk
with Schmitty yesterday.

36:06.208 --> 36:07.750
- What?
- Yeah.

36:07.750 --> 36:09.709
How did you find him?
What did he say?

36:09.709 --> 36:13.542
Hey, none of that matters, baby.
What matters is he
got the message.

36:13.542 --> 36:17.333
He just needed someone
to lay down the law,
if you know what I'm saying.

36:17.333 --> 36:21.041
So, we'll just go
through the garage.
Oh, are you Heather Hillman?

36:21.041 --> 36:23.250
- Yeah.
- Yeah, this is for you.

36:23.250 --> 36:25.709
I'm supposed to give this
to you personally.

36:28.375 --> 36:30.583
What the hell is this?

36:30.583 --> 36:32.333
- It's a summons.
- A what?

36:32.333 --> 36:37.542
- A summons... He's suing you?
- For a hundred
thousand dollars?

36:37.542 --> 36:40.875
For fraudulent inducement,
breach of contract,

36:40.875 --> 36:44.333
and intentional infliction
of emotional distress?

36:44.333 --> 36:48.542
What does this even mean?
Can he sue me for this?

36:48.542 --> 36:52.750
You bring me a muffin,
I give you a cupcake.

36:52.750 --> 36:55.750
- Well, at least
I paid for mine.
- Funny.

36:57.208 --> 36:59.917
So, I made doctors'
appointments for the girls.

36:59.917 --> 37:01.917
I want everyone
checked out.

37:01.917 --> 37:04.083
Good. That's a good idea.

37:04.083 --> 37:08.208
Yeah, I just...
I want to do something
about this now, you know?

37:08.208 --> 37:11.333
I hate just sitting around.
It's just terrible.

37:11.333 --> 37:12.917
Yeah, I know, I know.

37:12.917 --> 37:16.709
We should figure out
which pediatrician
we want to call on the list.

37:16.709 --> 37:18.709
See if they can't talk us
through this.

37:18.709 --> 37:21.417
Jeez, I know. Look at this.

37:21.417 --> 37:24.291
I need a doctor to help me
pick a doctor. I can't...

37:24.291 --> 37:25.625
No kidding.

37:27.083 --> 37:31.291
Oh, that can't be right.
No, this must be an old list.

37:31.291 --> 37:34.583
Let me see.
No, it was printed last week.

37:34.583 --> 37:36.125
Well, look at that.

37:36.125 --> 37:39.792
Dr. Marjorie Seaver.
Working in Santa Monica?

37:41.458 --> 37:42.875
That can't be right.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.458
[knocking]

38:01.208 --> 38:04.834
I didn't cancel dinner
with Adam and Heather.
I still want us to go.

38:04.834 --> 38:07.208
Dave and Deena
used to go there all the time.

38:07.208 --> 38:09.709
It's some restaurant
right here by the beach.

38:09.709 --> 38:13.583
Your duffel bag means
you think you're spending
the night here, too?

38:13.583 --> 38:16.166
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about Marjorie.

38:16.166 --> 38:18.375
- It's not what you think.
- What is it, then?

38:18.375 --> 38:22.417
All the stuff that happened.
Everything I did makes me look
like... an idiot.

38:22.417 --> 38:24.709
I didn't want you
to think of me as an idiot.

38:24.709 --> 38:27.959
- Well, it's a little
too late for that.
- Yeah, I know. I...

38:27.959 --> 38:30.792
I was afraid I'd mess things up
if I told you the truth.

38:30.792 --> 38:33.041
And you messed up
by not telling me the truth.

38:33.041 --> 38:35.041
Pretty much...

38:35.041 --> 38:38.000
...but that's over with.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.709
You know everything
and Marjorie doesn't matter

38:40.709 --> 38:44.834
because right now the only thing
I care about is you and me.

38:52.083 --> 38:54.125
I guess I better go change.

38:58.500 --> 39:00.250
I'll come help you.

39:10.083 --> 39:12.542
- Hi!
- Hi.

39:12.542 --> 39:14.917
Wow. I can't
believe you're here.

39:14.917 --> 39:19.000
- It's so good to see you.
- Yeah.
What have you been doing?

39:19.000 --> 39:21.792
- I have a lot
of questions for you.
- I'm sure you do.

39:21.792 --> 39:24.208
But first...

39:24.208 --> 39:27.458
...I want to hear about Carrie.

39:30.542 --> 39:33.542
- Did you talk to his lawyer?
- Yeah, I left him a message.

39:33.542 --> 39:35.625
- What are we going to do?
- Just relax.

39:35.625 --> 39:40.208
We're going to make it
all go away. It's just
a bluff for money.

39:40.208 --> 39:43.208
The guy's got no case, right?
He's just a customer.

39:43.208 --> 39:45.041
Yeah. He was just a customer.

39:45.041 --> 39:48.542
Did he really give you
all that money for lap dances?

39:48.542 --> 39:51.792
I don't know. Maybe.

39:51.792 --> 39:54.041
I never should've
said anything to you.

39:54.041 --> 39:57.417
- I would've noticed the TV.
- I didn't have
to say that it was him.

39:57.417 --> 39:59.583
Let's just not talk
about it anymore.

39:59.583 --> 40:02.750
Brian and Bridget
don't need to know
anything else about Schmitty.

40:02.750 --> 40:05.750
No one needs to know
anything else about Schmitty.

40:05.750 --> 40:08.041
Let's just go have
a nice, relaxing dinner.

40:08.041 --> 40:11.083
- Where are we going anyway?
- Some place that Brian picked.

40:13.583 --> 40:16.583
These doctors just throw
these words at you.

40:16.583 --> 40:21.875
And all you can think is,
"this is my daughter they're
talking about,"

40:21.875 --> 40:24.458
and I can't understand
anything they're saying.

40:24.458 --> 40:27.792
Deena, everything
is going to be fine, OK?

40:27.792 --> 40:29.792
Carrie's not
in any danger right now.

40:29.792 --> 40:32.083
And I'll be here
to talk you through all of it.

40:32.083 --> 40:35.083
I'll get you all the help you
need and I'm not going anywhere.

40:35.083 --> 40:38.625
- Thank you. Thank you.
- I'm just glad that I can help.

40:40.125 --> 40:42.417
So, can I start
asking questions now?

40:44.208 --> 40:46.041
You don't have to. Um...

40:46.041 --> 40:48.291
Let's see. I hated Minnesota.

40:48.291 --> 40:51.709
It was cold... and lonely,

40:51.709 --> 40:55.625
and after I finished my first
rotation in the hospital,

40:55.625 --> 40:59.834
- I put in to move back.
- And you didn't
contact any of us?

40:59.834 --> 41:02.458
I couldn't.

41:02.458 --> 41:06.000
I had a lot to work through
after what happened.

41:06.000 --> 41:10.750
And I wasn't ready to see
everyone. And I'm still not.

41:10.750 --> 41:13.792
I wasn't sure how everyone
would feel about seeing me.

41:13.792 --> 41:17.125
Well, I think it would be OK.
I really do.

41:17.917 --> 41:19.375
I don't know.

41:19.375 --> 41:21.417
Well, thank you
for meeting me here.

41:21.417 --> 41:26.125
I didn't want the first time
we saw each other to be
in the doctor's office.

41:26.125 --> 41:30.458
And if you don't want to see
the gang, that's fine with me.
I'll do whatever you want...

41:30.458 --> 41:34.834
Yeah, maybe we could
not tell anyone else
that I'm back in town just yet.

41:44.834 --> 41:47.542
I didn't have anything to do
with this, honey. I swear, I...

41:47.542 --> 41:49.959
