before the storm.

15:46.792 --> 15:48.635
Did I tell you that, Lotte?

She never understood that choosing
between the sublime and the sensible

enough disenchantment for one day.

your last employment?

20:14.708 --> 20:20.215
I have several irons in the fire
in the West End, one especially exciting.

20:20.375 --> 20:23.094
Don't expect me
to come and see it.

20:23.250 --> 20:25.673
I stopped expecting that
long ago, Mother.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.551
Oh, darling.

20:27.708 --> 20:31.167
You know I never come to see you
because if you weren't any good,

20:31.333 --> 20:32.835
it would break my heart.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.880
But I just might be very good.

21:14.750 --> 21:17.469

Yes.

is probably much like... nursing.

Oh, yes. Yes.

31:26.375 --> 31:29.424
(HUMS)

31:34.708 --> 31:36.130
It's pretty good.

31:36.292 --> 31:38.795
She'll be fine, Sir Basil.
I'll take it from here.

31:38.958 --> 31:42.041
Thank you, sister.
Goodnight.

32:05.458 --> 32:06.926
Oh.

32:07.083 --> 32:09.711
Um... I was just changing
out of my uniform.

32:09.875 --> 32:13.675
It's getting late. I thought I might
spend the night in my room.

32:18.875 --> 32:20.422
Do you have to go?

32:21.667 --> 32:23.089
No.

32:23.250 --> 32:25.093
Not really.

32:27.542 --> 32:29.715
'Cause there's something
I wanted to ask you.

32:31.667 --> 32:33.761
Is my mother
off with the pixies a lot?

32:33.917 --> 32:35.840

32:36.000 --> 32:39.083
It might be good not to
talk about your mum right now.

32:41.458 --> 32:43.460
Sorry, Dora.
Flora.

I've been having
a bit of trouble lately.

33:01.125 --> 33:04.584
Don't you find it kind of exciting
to be in your old room?

33:05.833 --> 33:07.961
I bet you were
quite the wild boy in here.

33:09.625 --> 33:12.595
Bet you haven't touched yourself
as much ever since.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.593
You are a wonder.

33:17.750 --> 33:21.425

you were in here all on your lonesome?

33:26.208 --> 33:29.963
I've always been a... careless boy
with delicate things.

33:33.667 --> 33:35.385
Would it be alright if I just...

33:35.542 --> 33:38.011
...held you for a while?

would be lovely, Cherry.

Mmm. It'll be small, won't it?

so we can talk?

Oh, no, it's fine, it doesn't matter.

someone even more important

34:49.000 --> 34:50.627
than Australia's
next prime minister.

It's an honour
to meet you, Princess.

34:53.333 --> 34:57.588
Really? I thought your platform
was republicanism.

I can always forgive a title
in a lovely lady.

35:03.167 --> 35:05.340
This is Zila, and this is Betty...

This is the Princess de Lascabanes.

Oh!

36:04.625 --> 36:06.468
It's alright.
Are you OK?

36:06.625 --> 36:08.298
Yeah, I'm OK.

36:23.292 --> 36:24.669
Where's the bed?

36:24.833 --> 36:27.837
Oh, are you having
a God-awful time?

36:28.000 --> 36:32.631
I shouldn't have done a party, I know,
but it's all Mummy trained me for.

36:34.125 --> 36:36.924
Oh, couldn't you at least
have worn a tiara?

36:40.250 --> 36:41.968
Shall I get Doug?
No, no!

Husbands aren't any use.

Oh, God, I know.

What was he like,

37:03.083 --> 37:04.175
Oh.

37:05.292 --> 37:08.091
If I tell you something,
will you promise not to pass it on?

Sweetheart, I won't
remember a thing in an hour.

Mmm. That's sweet.

No, it's not sweet.
It means "roast rump".

hilarious as well.

Didn't you get a huge settlement
out of them?

37:40.875 --> 37:42.297
No.

37:42.458 --> 37:44.051
I kept the title.

37:46.958 --> 37:48.426
But...

37:48.583 --> 37:50.381
How do you live over there?

37:50.542 --> 37:52.215
Well, it's difficult.

37:52.375 --> 37:54.469
I get a...

37:54.625 --> 37:57.595
...small allowance
from the family trust here.

37:57.750 --> 38:03.803
Mother thinks a few blankets in a Paris
winter are more character-building...

38:03.958 --> 38:05.801
How is your mother?

38:07.708 --> 38:09.085
Well...
Activity!

into Thorogood Village.

39:50.375 --> 39:51.752
Or is it me?

39:51.917 --> 39:55.091
I'm just trying your frock on.

Oh, yes.

39:59.042 --> 40:01.010
It is you, Flora. I see.

40:01.167 --> 40:05.092
We had so much trouble
getting the blood out of that material.

40:05.250 --> 40:10.336
How'd you get blood on it?
When the storm hit, of course.

40:10.500 --> 40:13.674
I was urged afterwards
to throw the dress away.

40:14.917 --> 40:17.966
But I convinced my dressmaker
to replace the bodice.

40:19.250 --> 40:22.333
People misunderstand
the significance of clothing.

40:23.792 --> 40:26.545
They dismiss fashion as frivolous.

40:26.708 --> 40:31.760
But how we dress
distinguishes the occasion.

40:33.875 --> 40:38.676
How could one ever discard a garment
that marked such a day?

40:40.000 --> 40:42.219
I'm sorry.

40:42.375 --> 40:44.753
I shouldn't have touched it.

40:44.917 --> 40:49.127
(LAUGHS) Might as well
get some wear out of it.

40:49.292 --> 40:52.341
Dorothy could never pull off
a dress like that.

40:55.708 --> 40:58.382
Would it be alright
if I wore this out somewhere?

40:59.417 --> 41:01.966
Not without the sapphire ring.

41:04.167 --> 41:05.544
What ring?

41:05.708 --> 41:08.837
Well, didn't you just
put it on your finger?

41:09.000 --> 41:09.922
Oh...

41:10.083 --> 41:13.417
I think you're just
a little bit mixed up, that's all.

41:14.958 --> 41:17.461
Why don't you go back
to your little nippy-nap?

41:17.625 --> 41:19.878
Sleep just wakes me up.

41:25.042 --> 41:27.511
It's such a beautiful dress.

41:31.125 --> 41:33.503

41:34.833 --> 41:39.293
Sorry, I don't mean to disturb you.
Oh, absolutely not. Please. Join us.

41:39.458 --> 41:41.506
No, I've just come
to say thank you.

41:41.667 --> 41:44.341
I'd be neglecting my mother if I...
if I stayed any longer.

41:44.500 --> 41:46.969
Well, let me call you a cab.
Oh, don't worry, Doug.

41:47.125 --> 41:49.594
I'll be heading off now too.

waiting outside.

42:00.875 --> 42:02.627
Yes, well, lovely to meet you.

42:06.792 --> 42:09.045
I know that dress.

42:09.208 --> 42:13.008
Your mum says a dress
should mark an occasion.

42:14.042 --> 42:16.420
Come in, please.

42:26.583 --> 42:28.210
Nice.

42:30.333 --> 42:31.880
You too.

42:36.417 --> 42:37.794
Oh!

42:37.958 --> 42:39.551
Steady on, Mr Shreve.

42:41.833 --> 42:43.380
No, g... gently.

42:43.542 --> 42:45.590
Gently. That's not my style, is it?

42:45.750 --> 42:48.924
See, all I can offer the ruling classes
is a bit of rough.

42:49.083 --> 42:52.292
Well, along with
your Oxford degree, of course.

42:52.458 --> 42:54.631
See, I knew you'd have
your own charm.

42:54.792 --> 42:57.045
Definitely more subtle
than Elizabeth's.

42:57.208 --> 42:59.336
She was quite a filly, that girl.

43:16.625 --> 43:18.002
Anyway.

43:18.167 --> 43:20.886

as your mother.

Yes, sir.

43:28.500 --> 43:29.877
Where are you taking me?

43:30.042 --> 43:32.215
I thought it was your intention
to perform your daughterly duties.

43:32.375 --> 43:34.298
I wish to go back to the club.
Of course!

43:34.458 --> 43:36.176
But you might like to arrange

43:36.333 --> 43:39.542
to move back to your family home
by the end of the week.

43:39.708 --> 43:42.757
Who do you think's paying
for your little stay at the club?

43:44.208 --> 43:46.586
Oh, the club...
i-informed me that...

43:46.750 --> 43:49.003
A man in my position
has to be cautious.

43:51.875 --> 43:54.094
You really are
an ungrateful little wretch, aren't you?

43:54.250 --> 43:56.127
Your mother, you see.

43:56.292 --> 43:59.011
She loved gifts.

43:59.167 --> 44:01.090
I think you may have
made a mistake.

44:01.250 --> 44:04.174
I mean, you will remember
that my account is settled?

44:04.333 --> 44:08.167
It was, madame, as far as
your accommodation was concerned.

44:08.333 --> 44:14.716
But these amounts are for extras
meals, phone, French newspapers.

44:16.500 --> 44:18.844
Would you care to settle now?

44:21.208 --> 44:23.586
I can't possibly
have spent that much.

you'd be able to love me, Flora?

Perhaps I should be
getting back soon.

45:19.292 --> 45:22.626
I can see why my mother
relies on you.

45:26.125 --> 45:28.219
Yours is a true profession.

45:30.167 --> 45:33.467
Unlike the kindergarten
where I amuse myself.

45:38.875 --> 45:41.048
Do you think
we could be real, Flora?

for something real.

48:45.958 --> 48:49.041
Are you really going to destroy
her husband's letters?

48:49.208 --> 48:51.552
Naturally.
Mrs Hunter requested it.

48:51.708 --> 48:55.212
She doesn't want Dorothy and Basil ever
to find her personal correspondence.

48:55.375 --> 48:58.003
LAL: Is that the one where
he offered Elizabeth her freedom?

48:58.167 --> 48:59.589
ARNOLD:
You've read them, then?

48:59.750 --> 49:04.051
Don't I take care of
all your private paperwork?

49:04.208 --> 49:06.711
Yes. You do, Lal. Thank you.

49:06.875 --> 49:09.879
She would have left him if she'd thought
there was anything better out there.

49:10.042 --> 49:12.044
(PHONE RINGS)
That'll be for you.

49:12.208 --> 49:16.088
Mrs Hunter always said I was uncivilised
to dine at this early hour.

49:16.250 --> 49:18.844
Mrs Hunter's children
have requested this meeting

49:19.000 --> 49:21.799
to establish a little more clarity

49:21.958 --> 49:23.835
on your running
of the household.

49:24.000 --> 49:29.382
My overriding concerns
relate to domestic costs.

49:29.542 --> 49:34.753
Firstly, could we address the question
of the consumption of food?

49:34.917 --> 49:37.636
Take me through an average day.

49:37.792 --> 49:39.214
Address?

49:39.375 --> 49:40.968
I feed who is hungry.

49:41.125 --> 49:43.844
I have seen the hunger
but never in my kitchen.

49:44.000 --> 49:45.718
It's alright, Lotte.

49:48.000 --> 49:49.798
Oh, goody.

49:49.958 --> 49:52.427
Mrs Hunter's favourite.
Mmm!

49:52.583 --> 49:55.132
You're wanting to get me
into more trouble?

49:55.292 --> 49:57.795
Don't worry about
Princess Lacabans.

49:57.958 --> 49:59.926
Mrs Hunter loves me.

50:00.083 --> 50:02.427
And so does Sir Basil.

50:02.583 --> 50:04.711
Oy, gevalt! You didn't.

50:04.875 --> 50:06.798
Oy, gevalt! I did.

50:06.958 --> 50:09.507
And he thinks
we might be real together.

50:09.667 --> 50:11.965
What have you done?

50:12.125 --> 50:14.719
Does the baby of a sir
get some sort of a title?

50:14.875 --> 50:16.297
Shh!

50:16.458 --> 50:19.211
Do not even mention
that there could be such a possibility.

50:19.375 --> 50:23.005
We must be
very truly careful now.

50:24.208 --> 50:25.585
This is how it is.

50:25.750 --> 50:32.087
It begins with praise, promises, favours.
It is their need and ours.

50:32.250 --> 50:34.628
Then one day,
they change the rules.

50:34.792 --> 50:39.127
No more business between us.
Just suspicion.

50:39.292 --> 50:41.010
Interviews.

50:41.167 --> 50:43.215
Isolation.

50:44.458 --> 50:49.214
We must give them no excuses!
Give who, you silly old biddy?

50:49.375 --> 50:51.469
The Nazis, of course.

51:04.917 --> 51:09.718
(SIGHS) The scent of those roses
is intoxicating, Dorothy.

51:09.875 --> 51:11.798
It's Mary, Mrs Hunter.

51:11.958 --> 51:15.508
Don't contradict. I said Mary.

51:17.542 --> 51:21.797
Oh, please be seated, Mrs Lippmann,
Flora. I have something to give you.

51:21.958 --> 51:25.792
You carry on, Mary.
I'm not going to give you anything.

51:25.958 --> 51:29.087
You're already complete
without adornment.

51:30.417 --> 51:33.261
I would prefer to stand
for whatever is to come.

51:33.417 --> 51:35.135
ELIZABETH:
Oh, for heaven's sakes, Lotte!

51:35.292 --> 51:38.796
I just wish to ask you
what you would like as a keepsake

51:38.958 --> 51:43.213
while I still have some sense
in this attic of a mind.

51:43.375 --> 51:46.219
A keepsake?
Where are you going?

51:46.375 --> 51:49.003
Nowhere.

51:50.458 --> 51:53.712
Then I would like my dress,
which was your dress,

51:53.875 --> 51:57.755
but only if Mr Wyburd will be
writing it down that I didn't steal it.

51:57.917 --> 52:00.761
Why else did I invite him?

52:00.917 --> 52:04.296
I'm writing that the dress
is now the property of Mrs Lippmann.

52:04.458 --> 52:09.589
It's a beaded dress, but every single
sequin was hand-sewn in Shanghai.

52:12.542 --> 52:15.842
My husband gave me
two sapphire rings.

52:16.958 --> 52:19.461
Blue sapphire is for...

52:19.625 --> 52:23.129
...intellect and intelligence.

52:23.292 --> 52:25.795
Pink sapphire is...

52:25.958 --> 52:28.427
...for you, little Flora.

52:30.500 --> 52:32.173
Is it pink?

52:33.667 --> 52:35.214
It's pink.

52:37.083 --> 52:39.586
ELIZABETH: Write, Arnold,
that she must wear it to celebrate

52:39.750 --> 52:41.718
her engagement to the chemist.

52:41.875 --> 52:44.344
What?! Col?

52:44.500 --> 52:47.879
Well, isn't it he who...
who hangs around

52:48.042 --> 52:50.841
sniffing after you
when you're in season?

52:51.000 --> 52:53.970
What makes you think
I'd marry him?

52:54.125 --> 52:57.254
I can tell you, I've got
something much better on offer.

52:57.417 --> 52:59.090
Please, Flora-Dora.

52:59.250 --> 53:00.843
Thank Mrs Hunter.

53:01.000 --> 53:04.083
Mr Wyburd, write that Flora
has accepted the ring.

53:04.250 --> 53:05.752
Shall I write that
that is the case?

53:05.917 --> 53:07.464
Yes.

53:07.625 --> 53:10.469
So long as it's not on the condition
that I marry Col.

53:10.625 --> 53:14.801
Not a condition,
just a hope, my dear.

53:14.958 --> 53:16.585
He's a decent man.

53:17.958 --> 53:19.960
Come closer, Mr Wyburd.

53:22.792 --> 53:25.716
This doesn't really fit
my jewellery collection.

53:27.667 --> 53:29.886
But I think
your wife might like it.

53:32.375 --> 53:34.628
I'm sure she will like it.

53:34.792 --> 53:38.968
It has some
personal significance.

53:39.125 --> 53:43.210
It was given to me
by Dorothy's young man on the island.

53:45.417 --> 53:47.010
Oh, his name...

53:47.167 --> 53:50.137
FLORA: Edvard Pell.
Edvard.

53:59.542 --> 54:01.715
(LAUGHS) That's my foot.

54:03.792 --> 54:05.009
Dorothy!

54:06.292 --> 54:08.340
Want to dip your toes in?

54:09.708 --> 54:11.506
Come on!

54:20.792 --> 54:22.920
Well, what are you waiting for?

54:23.083 --> 54:25.927
You may take your leave.

54:26.083 --> 54:28.632
(LAUGHTER)

54:28.792 --> 54:30.214
it's the season!

54:30.375 --> 54:31.968
Oh, dreamy!

54:32.125 --> 54:36.505
Strawberries and cream.
The perfect day for a pig.

54:39.833 --> 54:42.916
Anyone for tennis?
Anyone seen Dennis?

54:43.083 --> 54:45.586
I believe he's in Venice
with Janice.

54:45.750 --> 54:48.503
Oh, you can't be serious!

54:48.667 --> 54:50.465
WOMAN: He promised
he'd be here and win.

54:50.625 --> 54:53.344
WOMAN 2: We simply can't forfeit.
There's nothing else for it.

54:53.500 --> 54:56.549
James, you shall have to fill in.
(JAMES BABBLES)

54:56.708 --> 54:58.710
Well, I need a partner.

54:58.875 --> 55:01.128
Has anyone seen the gin?

55:01.292 --> 55:03.044
(LAUGHTER)

55:03.208 --> 55:06.337
(BASIL LAUGHS)

55:06.500 --> 55:09.754
(PLAY CONTINUES)

55:09.917 --> 55:12.215
(KNOCKING)

55:12.375 --> 55:14.377
Good evening, madame.
Hello.

55:14.542 --> 55:16.169
Oh, darling!

55:16.333 --> 55:17.710
Hello, Mother.

55:17.875 --> 55:19.502
What a pleasant surprise.

55:19.667 --> 55:22.750
Oh, I'm all excited now.

55:25.042 --> 55:29.343
We can have a lovely conversation.
Mother seems in fine form tonight.

55:29.500 --> 55:31.377
MARY: She is indeed.

55:36.417 --> 55:37.794
Oh.

55:37.958 --> 55:39.551
She's fallen asleep.

55:39.708 --> 55:41.176
MARY: it's the medication.

55:41.333 --> 55:45.258
We've had to
increase the dosage.

55:45.417 --> 55:47.715
She'll be asleep
for a little while now.

55:51.125 --> 55:52.502
MAN: Very funny audience.

55:52.667 --> 55:55.796
(CHATTER)

55:57.500 --> 56:01.255
Well, we both thought
you were all marvellous.

56:01.417 --> 56:04.296
Yes, looked like you were having
a really good time up there.

56:04.458 --> 56:06.927
What do you do, dear?
She's a really wonderful nurse.

56:07.083 --> 56:08.460
OTHERS: Oh!

56:08.625 --> 56:10.627
Good. Baz needs
taking care of, God knows.

56:10.792 --> 56:13.591
Oh, no, I look after his mother.
I played a nurse once.

56:13.750 --> 56:15.127
Oh?
"Romeo and Juliet".

56:15.292 --> 56:18.717
I find the nurse a rather redundant
character, don't you, Flora?

56:18.875 --> 56:21.344
I don't know. I haven't seen
'Romeo and Juliet' since school.

56:21.500 --> 56:23.548
WOMAN: Oh, you'll
have to remedy that, Baz.

56:23.708 --> 56:25.881
I will, when we go to London.

56:26.042 --> 56:28.795
MAN: Oh, you're coming to London?
Fabulous!

56:32.083 --> 56:33.926
So how long have you all
known each other?

56:34.083 --> 56:36.381
Oh, since Shakespeare was a boy.

56:36.542 --> 56:37.964
Janie.

56:38.125 --> 56:39.718
Come and talk to Flora.

56:41.333 --> 56:43.176
Squeeze in there.

56:43.333 --> 56:44.801
Flora, this is Janie.

56:44.958 --> 56:46.335
Hi.

56:46.500 --> 56:48.173
What sort of fur is that?

56:48.333 --> 56:50.006
Kangaroo.
OTHERS: Oh!

56:51.500 --> 56:55.334
Janie will probably be playing you
when I mount my play in London.

56:55.500 --> 56:58.344
Are you putting me in a play?

56:58.500 --> 57:00.844
Well, I'll have to get in
a bit of research.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.879
I'd be awfully grateful
if you'd help me out.

57:04.042 --> 57:06.591
You're not going to say
anything personal, though, are you?

57:06.750 --> 57:08.923
Well, of course we will,
but it won't seem personal

57:09.083 --> 57:12.292
because she'll have
an English accent.

57:12.458 --> 57:15.007
WOMAN: Baz, does your mother know
you two are an item?

57:15.167 --> 57:19.923
Not yet, but it's better for us,
isn't it, to wait until... after.

57:20.083 --> 57:21.835
After what?

57:22.000 --> 57:24.924
Well, you know what I mean.
My mother's got me on a short leash.

57:25.083 --> 57:27.427
And I can't really afford
to piss her off at the moment.

57:27.583 --> 57:31.633
(LAUGHS) Why would she
be pissed off? She likes me.

57:31.792 --> 57:34.966
Yes, well, as a nurse, she does,
but it's a different story

57:35.125 --> 57:38.095
if she knows that you're
possibly carrying the family line.

57:38.250 --> 57:41.174
(PEOPLE HISS, CLEAR THROATS)

57:41.333 --> 57:43.461
Well, you know, I mean, mothers.

57:43.625 --> 57:45.548
WOMAN: Oh, Basil!

57:53.750 --> 57:55.127
Excuse me.

57:55.292 --> 57:58.045
I have to go to the toilet.
Lavatory, dear.

57:58.208 --> 57:59.835
Flora!

58:01.833 --> 58:05.167
Oh, that was a fucking disaster.
Why did I have to say that?

58:05.333 --> 58:08.633
BASIL: Flora!
MAN: Oh, go after her, dear heart!

58:09.750 --> 58:12.424
I haven't the faintest idea
where she lives.

58:22.417 --> 58:25.751
(METAL CHINKS)

58:30.083 --> 58:32.586
DOROTHY: Do you ever feel
alone in the dark?

58:34.708 --> 58:36.802
No. Not at all.

58:42.500 --> 58:45.583
Your mother and I share
the spirituality of the night.

58:48.625 --> 58:50.252
You love her, don't you?

58:52.542 --> 58:56.172
Yes. Otherwise,
I couldn't do what I do.

58:58.000 --> 58:59.627
Hm.

59:01.083 --> 59:02.960
Love.

59:04.208 --> 59:05.881
It's so vast.

59:07.583 --> 59:11.463
It's difficult to imagine
how one can achieve it.

59:35.792 --> 59:38.875
(CHATTER AND LAUGHTER)

59:59.792 --> 01:00:01.794
Tea?

01:00:01.958 --> 01:00:03.380
Thank you.

01:00:03.542 --> 01:00:06.716
ELIZABETH: It was a charming idea
to pay me a visit, Lal.

01:00:06.875 --> 01:00:09.253
I haven't seen you since...

01:00:09.417 --> 01:00:12.500
I wanted to thank you in person
for my present.

01:00:12.667 --> 01:00:15.170
Letters are unsatisfactory,
don't you think?

01:00:15.333 --> 01:00:19.884
Yeah, I thought a gemstone
would suit you more than it does myself.

01:00:22.417 --> 01:00:24.545
Do you still have your freckles?

01:00:26.458 --> 01:00:28.460
They haven't
turned cancerous, have they?

01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:30.798
Oh! Not that I'm aware of.

01:00:30.958 --> 01:00:33.336
Sugar?
Uh, no, thank you.

01:00:36.375 --> 01:00:39.174
Have you offered Mr Wyburd
a chocolate biscuit?

01:00:39.333 --> 01:00:41.427
My husband isn't here.

01:00:41.583 --> 01:00:43.210
Yes, he is.

01:00:43.375 --> 01:00:45.423
He's right here in my bedroom.

01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:48.252
Oh.

01:00:48.417 --> 01:00:50.840
Oh, he's slipped away.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.584
We girls can talk about him
now properly.

01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:57.344
Milk?
Uh, no... Yes, please. Thanks.

01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:00.470
Does he treat you kindly, Lal?

01:01:00.625 --> 01:01:02.673
Does he love you?

01:01:02.833 --> 01:01:04.927
I believe so. Thank you.

01:01:05.083 --> 01:01:07.962
He's my husband,
and he's an honourable man.

01:01:08.125 --> 01:01:09.718
Oh, yes.

01:01:09.875 --> 01:01:12.253
Honourable, certainly.

01:01:13.792 --> 01:01:16.295
And so hairless.

01:01:18.375 --> 01:01:21.754
Why... why would you say that?
He isn't bald, even now.

01:01:21.917 --> 01:01:24.511
Cake?
No, thank you.

01:01:24.667 --> 01:01:26.669
I liked the feel of his skin.

01:01:27.833 --> 01:01:31.383
His was the...
softest and the whitest.

01:01:32.792 --> 01:01:34.339
What?

01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:36.127
What are you saying?

01:01:36.292 --> 01:01:40.172
It was nothing, Lal.
Just flesh on flesh.

01:01:41.917 --> 01:01:45.967
It only counts
when love is involved.

01:01:46.125 --> 01:01:48.469
My husband understood that.

01:01:56.167 --> 01:01:58.841
Do you think you shall enjoy
Thorogood Village?

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.298
I believe your children
are confident

01:02:01.458 --> 01:02:03.460
they'll find suitable accommodation
for you there.

01:02:08.833 --> 01:02:11.086
Cherry Cheeseman's mother
died there.

01:02:11.250 --> 01:02:12.843
Yes.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.756
I believe the children are waiting
for another such vacancy.

01:02:17.917 --> 01:02:21.251
You and Arnold can go there
if you think it's so nice!

01:02:21.417 --> 01:02:23.260
We couldn't afford it, Elizabeth.

01:02:27.417 --> 01:02:29.090
I'd like you to leave.

01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:30.797
I'm tired.

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:35.302
Though not as tired
as my husband was.

01:02:37.792 --> 01:02:41.001

to your country home.

Goodbye, Mrs Hunter.

01:02:59.458 --> 01:03:01.176
How was the visit?
It was awful.

01:03:01.333 --> 01:03:03.927
All the staff grilling me about
the children's criminal intention

01:03:04.083 --> 01:03:05.551
to put their mother away.

01:03:05.708 --> 01:03:07.585

I can't imagine.

01:03:17.583 --> 01:03:19.381
I always looked up
to Mrs Hunter

01:03:19.542 --> 01:03:22.091
as somebody who was beautiful
and sometimes brilliant,

01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:26.335
but she's too selfish
and too greedy.

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:28.343

01:03:30.958 --> 01:03:35.088

that I'd been told in confidence.

01:03:35.250 --> 01:03:36.877
Didn't stop to think?

01:03:37.042 --> 01:03:40.171
After all these years,
not to be ethically conditioned?!

to one meal a day

to accept her salary.

01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:52.959
Flora surprised me with
her open condemnation of the children,

01:03:53.125 --> 01:03:55.093
and Mary can't stop praying.

01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:58.584

attorney at present, they would succeed.

regarding Thorogood Village.

It is entirely my fault, I'm afraid.

01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:19.548
I let it slip.

01:05:19.708 --> 01:05:23.292
Well, not to worry, Mother.

recite something for me.

a much grander exit than this.

she could stay in your room.

01:16:05.125 --> 01:16:08.208
I wrote goodbye to my father
in French.

01:16:08.375 --> 01:16:11.174
I can't really look at that one.

01:16:14.667 --> 01:16:16.044
(CLEARS THROAT)

01:16:16.208 --> 01:16:18.336
"My dear old Dad,"

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:22.676
"You're the last man I'd like to think
a victim of this most horrible illness."

01:16:22.833 --> 01:16:24.460
“I'm even more depressed

01:16:24.625 --> 01:16:27.674
for being unable to concentrate
all my thoughts on you,

01:16:27.833 --> 01:16:30.803
as we are in
the throes of rehearsal.”

01:16:30.958 --> 01:16:33.586
Read the postscript.

01:16:37.167 --> 01:16:43.174
“PS. Nobody can realise the strain
of taking on such a role as Macbeth.”

01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:50.959
Not the best thing to have said
in the circumstances.

01:16:54.667 --> 01:16:56.294
Oh, Lotte, get up.

01:16:56.458 --> 01:16:59.632
The cleaner will attend to that.
Mrs Kirsch has resigned.

01:16:59.792 --> 01:17:02.921
And so has the chauffeur
since madame took the car.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.004
Will you stop it?
Your feet are swelling up.

01:17:08.167 --> 01:17:11.091
If you can't dance for Mrs Hunter,
you'll be really stuffed.

01:17:11.250 --> 01:17:14.584
Then my usefulness
will have no use.

01:17:15.833 --> 01:17:17.210
What is burning?

01:17:17.375 --> 01:17:18.922
Oh, no!

01:17:19.083 --> 01:17:20.630
My strudel!

01:17:23.208 --> 01:17:25.302
LOTTE: All burnt!

01:17:28.042 --> 01:17:31.376
It is because I am giving thought
to the terrible mess you have us all in.

01:17:34.083 --> 01:17:36.131
Well, you needn't worry about it.

01:17:36.292 --> 01:17:39.011
It's all over with Basil.

01:17:39.167 --> 01:17:40.134
Turns out

01:17:40.292 --> 01:17:42.090
we don't speak the same language.

01:17:42.250 --> 01:17:43.797
But you think
that there is a child?

01:17:43.958 --> 01:17:46.802
I'm regular as clockwork,
and I'm four days late.

01:17:46.958 --> 01:17:49.256
Oh, Flora-Dora.

01:17:50.375 --> 01:17:52.218
I am knowing something
what might help you.

01:17:52.375 --> 01:17:54.719
They begin with
a hot bath and brandy.

01:17:56.167 --> 01:17:58.340
You're not laying a finger
on me, Lotte.

01:18:00.417 --> 01:18:01.964
You remember me, don't you?

01:18:02.125 --> 01:18:03.502
Arnold.

01:18:03.667 --> 01:18:06.170
Oh, yes.

01:18:07.458 --> 01:18:09.426
I sent for you.

01:18:09.583 --> 01:18:11.631
Because...

01:18:11.792 --> 01:18:15.296
You wish to make some adjustments
to your final wishes?

01:18:15.458 --> 01:18:17.005
Yes.

01:18:18.958 --> 01:18:23.008
I wish to leave the bulk of my estate
to my husband.

01:18:24.458 --> 01:18:27.462
Mrs Hunter, your husband
is no longer with us.

01:18:27.625 --> 01:18:30.549
Just because Alfred
lives in the country

01:18:30.708 --> 01:18:35.669
doesn't mean that my marriage isn't the
most important thing in the world to me.

01:18:37.083 --> 01:18:40.007
Perhaps your husband
does not need the money now and...

01:18:40.167 --> 01:18:42.670
...might prefer
that you consider someone else.

01:18:42.833 --> 01:18:47.794
Alright, then, if my husband's
going to be like that.

01:18:47.958 --> 01:18:50.882
I'll leave it to
the German dancer.

01:18:52.917 --> 01:18:55.136
She's like this
nearly all the time now.

01:19:00.917 --> 01:19:02.669
I think...

01:19:03.792 --> 01:19:07.001
...you're gonna have to decide
what she'd want if she was still all there.

01:19:07.167 --> 01:19:09.090
FLORA: Do you want
her kids coming back here

01:19:09.250 --> 01:19:11.002
and saying
that she's incompetent?

01:19:11.167 --> 01:19:13.590
They will. (POURS LIQUID)
They'll put her in that home.

01:19:17.125 --> 01:19:20.129
My Wyburd's got some
nice cool water for you, love.

01:19:25.083 --> 01:19:26.756
Thank you.

01:19:31.875 --> 01:19:34.628
Well. Shall we begin, then?

01:19:36.083 --> 01:19:39.053
I wish to leave
the bulk of my estate

01:19:39.208 --> 01:19:41.302
to you, Mr Wyburd.

01:19:43.125 --> 01:19:46.550
You have served me
with such loyalty and discretion.

01:19:46.708 --> 01:19:49.257
I've done so little for you
in return.

01:19:55.625 --> 01:19:57.127
I'll sign, then.

01:19:57.292 --> 01:19:59.920
And then I want to go to sleep.

01:20:01.875 --> 01:20:04.674
Hurry up. Help me sign.

01:20:04.833 --> 01:20:10.215
No, Flora. Could you please leave us?
This must be my responsibility alone.

01:20:14.833 --> 01:20:16.460
Help me.

01:20:22.958 --> 01:20:24.631
Don't go.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.630
You see, I...
I'm a little afraid, you know.

01:20:29.792 --> 01:20:34.172
I don't remember things
much any more.

01:20:35.792 --> 01:20:40.377
I only seem to remember
things from way back, when...

01:20:43.958 --> 01:20:47.963
Life is unforgettable moments...

01:20:50.542 --> 01:20:52.715
...with dull routine in between.

01:20:56.792 --> 01:20:59.295
Without those moments...

01:21:01.917 --> 01:21:04.170
...what do we have left
to remember?

01:21:13.083 --> 01:21:16.383
(BIRDSONG)
(ROOSTER CROWS)

01:21:16.542 --> 01:21:19.216
Running away from home... sir?

01:21:25.167 --> 01:21:27.386
You want to be dropped here?
Thank you.

01:21:27.542 --> 01:21:30.295
I used to come here
looking for yabbies.

01:21:30.458 --> 01:21:32.381
Not enough water
to drown yourself in here.

01:21:32.542 --> 01:21:34.385
I'll pick you up soon.

01:21:34.542 --> 01:21:36.135
I'm in no hurry.

01:21:36.292 --> 01:21:39.262
Jeez, you people
have got it made.

01:21:54.042 --> 01:21:57.012
(LAUGHS)

01:21:58.708 --> 01:22:02.542
"Mmm". "Muh", "muh", "muh", "muh".

01:22:02.708 --> 01:22:08.920
You heavens, give me that patience,
patience I need!

01:22:09.083 --> 01:22:12.417
I will have such revenges on you both
that all the world...

01:22:12.583 --> 01:22:14.802
I will do such things!

01:22:14.958 --> 01:22:19.509
What they are yet, I know not,
but they shall be the terrors of the earth!

01:22:19.667 --> 01:22:25.128
But this heart shall break into a hundred
thousand ﬂaws or ere I'll weep.

01:22:25.292 --> 01:22:28.466
Oh, fool, I shall go mad!

01:22:28.625 --> 01:22:31.708
Oh, shit! Shit!

01:22:31.875 --> 01:22:33.252
Shit!

01:22:33.417 --> 01:22:35.465
Ow!

01:22:35.625 --> 01:22:38.048
Dad said you'd do something stupid.
ANNE: Mogs!

01:22:38.208 --> 01:22:39.710
Like paddling.

01:22:39.875 --> 01:22:41.877
I was always a clumsy blighter.

01:22:42.042 --> 01:22:46.377
Fell out of a tree as a kid,
as I recall. Broke your arm.

01:22:46.542 --> 01:22:49.546
Your mother never taught you two
how to look after yourselves.

01:22:49.708 --> 01:22:51.710
Here, do you think
you can manage this?

01:22:51.875 --> 01:22:53.422
Yes.

01:22:55.583 --> 01:22:57.130
Never had much time for her.

01:22:57.292 --> 01:22:59.920
Well, you're the only man
I've ever heard say that.

01:23:00.083 --> 01:23:04.042
But I came round to her in the end.
Ah! They all do.

01:23:04.208 --> 01:23:06.961
I still remember Dad
carrying me home.

01:23:07.125 --> 01:23:09.378
DOCTOR:
He was a good man, your dad.

01:23:09.542 --> 01:23:13.467
When he got really crook, he wanted
to finish it off here in his own home.

01:23:13.625 --> 01:23:16.595
Yeah, your mother looked after him
round the clock. She did everything.

01:23:16.750 --> 01:23:19.173
She gave him his final shot.

01:23:19.333 --> 01:23:21.335
Because your dad knew
your mother had the guts

01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:23.878
to do what needed to be done
without flinching.

01:23:24.042 --> 01:23:28.422
He was in such pain, you know. She
couldn't stand to see him in such pain.

01:23:28.583 --> 01:23:31.006
I loved your mother.

01:23:33.958 --> 01:23:35.551
(GASPS)

01:23:35.708 --> 01:23:38.757
You shouldn't even be standing
on these, let alone dancing.

01:23:38.917 --> 01:23:42.922
But I must dance for her.
She has asked for me.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.094
You won't be telling her
about my feet, will you?

01:23:46.250 --> 01:23:47.627
Why not?

01:23:47.792 --> 01:23:49.760
She does not care
for weakness in others.

01:23:49.917 --> 01:23:52.261
And we must be making her
still care for us.

01:23:52.417 --> 01:23:54.385
Please, Flora-Dora.

01:23:54.542 --> 01:23:56.169
Please.

01:24:00.792 --> 01:24:04.922
You will stay with me, won't you?
As long as I don't have to watch.

01:24:05.083 --> 01:24:08.462
It's not the likes of you
I must amuse.

01:24:45.625 --> 01:24:47.252
Princess de Lascabanes!

01:24:47.417 --> 01:24:49.511
I was looking for Anne.

01:24:49.667 --> 01:24:51.135
She's asleep.
Oh.

01:24:51.292 --> 01:24:56.128
Whereas I like to prowl
around the house all night.

01:24:57.500 --> 01:25:01.676
Oh. Just a... tiny bit.

01:25:09.583 --> 01:25:11.130
Oh. Sorry.

01:25:13.458 --> 01:25:15.210
Where's old Basil, then?

01:25:15.375 --> 01:25:18.379
Oh. He's asleep, probably.
(CHUCKLES)

01:25:18.542 --> 01:25:20.044
You got to admire him,

01:25:20.208 --> 01:25:23.667
out there, shouting
his ﬂaming poetry at the breeze.

01:25:23.833 --> 01:25:28.589
Now, he can get away with it.
Don't you reckon?

01:25:30.083 --> 01:25:33.633
I have no idea.
I hardly know my brother.

01:25:36.250 --> 01:25:37.797
Hm.

01:25:49.292 --> 01:25:51.590
Hm.

01:26:02.083 --> 01:26:03.835
Yes, so, um...

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.925
I...we, Basil and myself,
we feel like we're imposing.

01:26:08.083 --> 01:26:09.801
So, um...

01:26:09.958 --> 01:26:13.132
We'd just like to offer you
some sort of recompense.

01:26:16.208 --> 01:26:21.135
I've never thought of friendship as
something you have to pay for, Dorothy.

01:26:21.292 --> 01:26:22.839
Not like love.

01:26:24.750 --> 01:26:25.797
No.

01:26:27.958 --> 01:26:29.505
Well, of course. Um...

01:26:29.667 --> 01:26:33.171
I... I think I expressed myself crudely.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.083
So... goodnight.

01:26:48.250 --> 01:26:49.843
Hm.

01:26:52.750 --> 01:26:55.094
(GROANS)

01:26:56.750 --> 01:27:00.835
Lust is always difficult
to understand.

01:27:03.542 --> 01:27:08.048
And too often,
it doesn't end well.

01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:34.218

BASIL: Dottie?

01:27:34.375 --> 01:27:38.084
(SOBS)
Dottie? Are you alright?

01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:51.468
What's worrying you, darling?

01:27:54.625 --> 01:27:56.002
Shh, shh, shh.

01:27:56.167 --> 01:27:59.216
I have to leave this place.

01:28:02.042 --> 01:28:04.795
This place churns up
difficult memories.

01:28:04.958 --> 01:28:06.505
(SOBS)

01:28:08.250 --> 01:28:10.878
A barren childhood.

01:28:11.042 --> 01:28:12.715
A barren life.

01:28:20.250 --> 01:28:25.006
<i>Is it better to lock
loveless misery in a box,</i>

01:28:25.167 --> 01:28:29.422
<i>buried deep in a bedroom closet
with all the other remnants of childhood?</i>

01:28:29.583 --> 01:28:30.960
That's better.

01:28:31.125 --> 01:28:35.380
<i>Or is it braver to take it out and
examine it in the more forgiving light?</i>

01:28:37.042 --> 01:28:38.419
Where are you going?

01:28:38.583 --> 01:28:41.792
We're waiting on you for lunch.
I'm flying back to the mainland.

01:28:41.958 --> 01:28:44.177
For heaven's sake, Dorothy!

01:28:44.333 --> 01:28:47.212
What is wrong with you, darling,
that you must carry on so?

01:28:47.375 --> 01:28:49.469
I don't want to talk about it.

01:28:51.167 --> 01:28:53.545
You're at a difficult age
for a woman, that's all.

01:28:53.708 --> 01:28:55.961
No, Mother. That's not it.

01:28:56.125 --> 01:29:01.177
It's the relentless, utterly predictable
nature of your ferocious assaults!

01:29:04.542 --> 01:29:08.046
Well, you could have had it,
but you... didn't seem to want it.

01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:14.298
At least give me a hug...

01:29:14.458 --> 01:29:17.917
Do not touch me
with your greasy hands!

01:29:19.417 --> 01:29:20.919
Oh...

01:29:21.083 --> 01:29:23.006
Something is wrong?

01:29:26.917 --> 01:29:28.919
Help yourself
to something to eat, Edvard,

01:29:29.083 --> 01:29:31.006
and then I think it's best
you leave.

01:29:33.250 --> 01:29:35.753
In you go, nice and warm.

01:29:52.458 --> 01:29:56.508

01:51:25.583 --> 01:51:27.381
Ah. Dommage.

01:51:27.542 --> 01:51:33.094
BASIL: It might be less painful in the end
if we never allowed ourselves to forget

01:51:33.250 --> 01:51:35.594
that our clumsy ﬂesh,

01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:39.800
in which we throb and flicker,

01:51:39.958 --> 01:51:41.801
is only a disguise

01:51:41.958 --> 01:51:46.293
until we are
unburdened by death...

01:51:47.833 --> 01:51:50.962
...which is our natural conclusion.
