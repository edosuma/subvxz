WEBVTT

00:19.520 --> 00:21.772
Come on, come on!

00:21.855 --> 00:24.816
This is the best roller coaster
in the whole park!

00:25.817 --> 00:29.530
Hurry up, we waited in line for two hours!

00:29.613 --> 00:32.573
Okay, okay, you know I don't love heights.

00:32.658 --> 00:35.077
Bayani, there are nine-year-olds
on this thing!

00:35.827 --> 00:38.872
Children have nothing to live for.

00:38.956 --> 00:41.375
I just got promoted at work.

00:41.458 --> 00:43.460
Come on. You can do this.

00:43.544 --> 00:46.463
Just close your eyes and it will
be over before you know it.

00:46.547 --> 00:49.591
Hold my hand. I'm here for you.

00:50.759 --> 00:52.928
I feel better.

00:53.011 --> 00:56.390
Here we go-o-o-o!
I think you're going to love it.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.605
Why won't it move?!

01:03.689 --> 01:05.941
Why won't it move?!

01:06.024 --> 01:08.610
What's happening?!

01:08.694 --> 01:10.529
Why?!

01:10.612 --> 01:13.574
WHO DID THIS TO US?

01:13.657 --> 01:15.075
Good morning!

01:15.158 --> 01:18.036
-Mama brought Frappuccinos.
-Hi, Molly.

01:18.370 --> 01:20.831
What's going on? Is that real?

01:20.914 --> 01:23.584
Yeah. They've been stuck upside down
for, like, seven hours.

01:23.667 --> 01:25.794
Some shady theme park in the Philippines.

01:25.878 --> 01:27.880
Yeah.
Apparently nothing was built to code.

01:27.963 --> 01:30.132
Cost cutting, bribery. Horrible.

01:30.215 --> 01:32.134
Oh, my God. I feel so bad for them.

01:32.217 --> 01:35.804
Okay, who wants a pumpkin spice?

01:35.888 --> 01:40.642
We are being told Excitement Park is owned
by KMVR Entertainment International,

01:40.726 --> 01:44.021
a holding company
owned by billionaire Molly Wells.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.898
City officials have sent

01:45.981 --> 01:48.233
-all available resources to oversee…
-No, no! Do not let her see the TV.

01:48.317 --> 01:50.110
-She's gonna--
-…attempt to rescue the passengers.

01:50.194 --> 01:52.446
-Look so beautiful.
-No comment from Wells

01:52.529 --> 01:55.574
-or any of her representatives.
-Hello, cheekbones!

01:55.657 --> 01:58.035
Oh, shit!

02:45.541 --> 02:47.501
-Have they gotten them out yet?
-No.

02:47.918 --> 02:50.546
But they did feed them dinner,
so that's nice.

02:51.380 --> 02:52.840
How are they going to poop?

02:52.923 --> 02:55.467
So, I just got off the phone
with my lawyers.

02:55.551 --> 02:58.804
Apparently, John bought a lot of companies
over the years,

02:58.887 --> 03:02.683
and during the divorce,
I got half of them, which was news to me.

03:02.766 --> 03:05.185
How could you not know
you own an entire theme park?

03:05.269 --> 03:09.606
Well, there were bundled assets
and division of property.

03:09.690 --> 03:13.360
And honestly, I was drunk
for the July that that was all happening.

03:13.443 --> 03:16.446
Okay, that is
some truly sick rich-person shit.

03:16.530 --> 03:20.158
You should see what we do with our boats
on New Year's Eve. It's horrifying.

03:20.242 --> 03:21.660
I actually need to go.

03:21.743 --> 03:24.162
We have
that zoning commission meeting today

03:24.246 --> 03:25.873
about the Alameda Street housing project,

03:25.956 --> 03:28.166
so, hopefully,
none of them watch the news.

03:28.250 --> 03:29.793
I should probably sit this one out, right?

03:29.877 --> 03:31.295
Yes. That would be wise.

03:31.378 --> 03:34.089
And while I'm there, you should probably
figure out everything you own,

03:34.173 --> 03:36.592
because this is not good for us.

03:36.675 --> 03:38.051
This makes people not like us.

03:38.135 --> 03:39.219
I'm on it.

03:47.603 --> 03:50.981
That's not gonna work.
That ladder's not long enough.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.861
Come on in. Hi.

03:55.944 --> 03:56.945
Hi.

03:57.029 --> 03:58.947
Thank you so much
for looking over this stuff.

03:59.031 --> 04:01.450
Oh, my God. Are you kidding me?
No, I'm an accountant.

04:01.533 --> 04:03.911
I get super jazzed up
about doing stuff like this.

04:05.204 --> 04:09.208
"Jazzed up"?
Is that Gen Z slang I'm not familiar with?

04:10.792 --> 04:13.212
No, but they're
definitely bringing it back.

04:13.295 --> 04:14.838
-Got it.
-Yeah.

04:15.506 --> 04:19.468
Okay, I have gone through all your assets,
and we have three piles here.

04:19.551 --> 04:22.471
First pile are A-okay, normal companies.

04:22.554 --> 04:23.639
-Okay, great.
-Okay.

04:23.722 --> 04:25.390
Second pile are problems.

04:25.474 --> 04:28.227
Oil, some weapons manufacturers

04:28.310 --> 04:29.353
and, believe it or not,

04:29.436 --> 04:32.231
you actually own most of the theme parks
in the Philippines.

04:32.314 --> 04:35.359
-Oh, no. I definitely want to sell those.
-Agreed.

04:35.442 --> 04:40.072
Now, the middle pile is
what I like to call "NMIs."

04:40.155 --> 04:43.951
Okay, now, that stands for
"Need More Information."

04:44.993 --> 04:48.247
It's just a little abbreviation
I came up with in my 30s.

04:48.330 --> 04:52.417
"The Palmdale Gallery of Southwestern Art
and First American Heritage."

04:52.501 --> 04:54.920
-Yeah.
-That sounds nice. What's wrong with that?

04:55.003 --> 04:57.214
I'm a little worried
about "First American Heritage."

04:57.297 --> 05:01.301
I see. Because it could be
"First American" as in Native American,

05:01.385 --> 05:04.847
or it could be "First American"
as in "We're the first Americans!"

05:04.930 --> 05:07.099
-Exactly.
-Okay. Let's go.

05:07.182 --> 05:08.308
What?

05:08.392 --> 05:11.478
That's the only way we'll know for sure,
is if we go and check it out ourselves.

05:11.562 --> 05:15.148
Okay. But can I just leave the office
in the middle of the day?

05:15.232 --> 05:16.900
Well, of course. I'm your boss, aren't I?

05:16.984 --> 05:21.780
Okay. Yeah. I did bring my lunch,
but I guess I could bring it with me.

05:21.864 --> 05:25.576
Oh, yeah.
You have a little lunch box. That's cute.

05:25.659 --> 05:28.912
It's actually not a lunch box.
It is a weather-resistant cooler.

05:30.205 --> 05:32.457
Yeah, they tested it in space.

05:32.541 --> 05:35.169
-You sound really jazzed up about that.
-Now you're getting it.

05:35.252 --> 05:37.296
-Let's go.
-Now you're getting it.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.594
-Hey, Evie.
-Hi.

05:50.475 --> 05:51.602
Audition scenes?

05:55.772 --> 05:58.942
So, how are things in the Philippines?

05:59.026 --> 06:00.444
Not great.

06:00.527 --> 06:03.572
They finally got some firemen up there,
but now they're stuck too.

06:05.449 --> 06:06.700
You left these in the printer.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.662
Oh, no. Those aren't mine.

06:10.746 --> 06:12.080
Yes, they are.

06:12.164 --> 06:15.459
I have access to the printer log.
I know what everyone prints out.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.836
Why didn't you tell me you were an actor?

06:17.920 --> 06:19.505
This actually makes perfect sense.
I was like,

06:19.588 --> 06:23.509
"This guy is way too handsome to not be
on screen or at least leading a cult."

06:23.592 --> 06:26.178
Okay, fine. I did a little bit of acting
when I first got here,

06:26.261 --> 06:28.597
but then I got this great job with Molly
and I left it all behind,

06:28.680 --> 06:30.557
like a kid you leave at Target, okay?

06:30.641 --> 06:33.560
Of course I think about it sometimes,
but I'm never going back there.

06:33.644 --> 06:36.813
I think you should audition.
I mean, this play looks legit.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.650
Sounds like it's about a dead dad,
and that always works.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.528
No. Sometimes I like
to print out the audition scenes,

06:42.611 --> 06:43.779
but I never actually go.

06:43.862 --> 06:45.989
It's a small part. It doesn't matter.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.824
It's dumb. Don't worry about it.

06:48.450 --> 06:49.451
Are you sure?

06:58.627 --> 07:02.756
Okay. This isn't too bad.
Nothing problematic.

07:02.840 --> 07:06.426
It looks okay to me.
But I don't know a ton about art.

07:07.177 --> 07:08.428
Nobody does.

07:08.512 --> 07:10.013
You know the secret?

07:10.097 --> 07:13.517
You just walk around squinting
like everything's really interesting.

07:13.600 --> 07:14.935
Really?

07:16.144 --> 07:19.231
-This one's not too bad actually.
-Really?

07:19.314 --> 07:21.066
Yeah, I mean, look at it. It's huge.

07:21.149 --> 07:23.151
And it's got all the Southwestern hits.

07:23.235 --> 07:26.071
You know, you got the sunset and the cacti

07:26.154 --> 07:27.322
and the rock formations.

07:27.406 --> 07:28.574
What more could you ask for?

07:29.992 --> 07:31.201
What's your favorite?

07:34.288 --> 07:35.747
I like this one.

07:36.498 --> 07:39.626
Seriously? All these paintings
and you pick that tiny little bird?

07:39.710 --> 07:41.962
Yeah. I've always liked birds.

07:42.671 --> 07:46.258
They're just these beautiful,
perfectly made little creatures.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.052
And normally,
you only get a second of that beauty

07:49.136 --> 07:50.929
because you know they're gonna fly away.

07:54.725 --> 07:56.768
-Sorry. That was cheesy.
-No.

07:57.603 --> 07:59.313
That wasn't bad.

07:59.396 --> 08:02.941
All right, I'm gonna go hit the bathrooms,
make sure there are no racist toilets.

08:03.025 --> 08:04.234
Good call.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.989
-Excuse me. Do you work here?
-Yes. Can I help you with anything?

08:09.072 --> 08:11.742
Yes, I'd like to talk to you
about that bird painting.

08:11.825 --> 08:12.951
Okay.

08:22.753 --> 08:26.465
Hey. Why don't you check out
this fun video I found?

08:26.548 --> 08:30.594
Okay, but if it's that panda and a dog
that are friends, I've already seen it.

08:32.638 --> 08:36.183
I've got a date with Kristin,
but I'm still so sweaty from the big game.

08:36.850 --> 08:37.934
Try AXE body spray.

08:45.317 --> 08:46.318
I think Kristin likes it.

08:48.487 --> 08:50.030
And so does her sister.

08:52.199 --> 08:55.744
AXE body spray.
You'll be beating them off.

08:56.703 --> 08:57.746
How did you find this?

08:57.829 --> 08:59.706
I thought they had to take it down
after the lawsuit.

09:00.290 --> 09:03.043
You can't show that video to anyone, ever.

09:03.126 --> 09:06.797
Okay. Is that ad a problematic reflection
of our attitudes towards women

09:06.880 --> 09:08.423
in the not-so-distant past?

09:08.507 --> 09:09.550
Yes.

09:09.633 --> 09:11.844
But are you good in it? Also yes.

09:12.803 --> 09:14.721
I mean, come on. You're a great actor.

09:14.805 --> 09:16.723
You got the skills. You got the bod.

09:16.807 --> 09:19.226
I didn't know it till you walked by me,
but you even got the butt.

09:19.309 --> 09:21.019
I mean, this should be a no-brainer.

09:21.103 --> 09:23.272
You just-- Try the script with me.
Just once.

09:25.107 --> 09:26.108
Just give me that.

09:29.528 --> 09:30.737
"Trevor, look at me.

09:32.030 --> 09:33.490
You're nothing like your father.

09:34.157 --> 09:36.451
I know I've only been with you
since the election,

09:36.535 --> 09:43.417
but I know that you are a kind,
compassionate, beautiful person.

09:44.793 --> 09:46.044
That's why I--

09:48.088 --> 09:50.924
I didn't want to do it like this,
but fuck it.

09:52.759 --> 09:53.927
Will you marry me?"

09:57.806 --> 09:59.057
Goose bumps.

10:01.894 --> 10:04.563
With Council Member Saldana's
recent support,

10:04.646 --> 10:08.400
I truly feel this is the time to place
this housing complex on the agenda

10:08.483 --> 10:10.652
for the next city council meeting.

10:10.736 --> 10:13.071
Our unhoused community
urgently needs it now.

10:13.530 --> 10:14.615
Thank you for your comments.

10:14.698 --> 10:18.327
Before you go, I just had a question
about your boss Molly Wells.

10:18.410 --> 10:20.913
Just to address
the roller coaster situation,

10:20.996 --> 10:22.497
that's all being taken care of.

10:22.581 --> 10:25.792
That's good to know. I'm just wondering
about her day-to-day involvement

10:25.876 --> 10:26.919
with the foundation.

10:28.045 --> 10:30.255
Molly is certainly important,

10:30.339 --> 10:32.633
but my team and I are
really the ones on point.

10:32.716 --> 10:34.843
But if she's working at the foundation,

10:34.927 --> 10:37.221
she'll be involved in this project,
correct?

10:38.555 --> 10:40.349
We haven't discussed that yet.

10:40.432 --> 10:41.934
As I said, we can--

10:42.017 --> 10:44.144
I, for one, wouldn't mind seeing her
come to a meeting.

10:45.479 --> 10:49.274
I think what she's doing as someone
in her position is really admirable.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.328
Okay, so I have to ask.

11:01.411 --> 11:05.332
Was this some sort of
weird exotic animal trading thing?

11:06.458 --> 11:08.043
Definitely not.

11:08.126 --> 11:10.462
This was an anniversary present.

11:11.046 --> 11:14.091
John missed our dinner for work

11:14.174 --> 11:16.927
-and knew I liked alpaca sweaters…
-Wow.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.596
…and decided to buy this farm

11:19.680 --> 11:21.431
to make up for that.

11:22.516 --> 11:24.434
So, just typical marriage stuff.

11:24.518 --> 11:25.894
-Yeah.
-Got it.

11:27.104 --> 11:28.605
Oh, great. Thank you.

11:31.149 --> 11:33.026
Think I'll keep this place too.

11:33.819 --> 11:37.155
Nothing bad happening.
Just a bunch of adorable animals.

11:37.739 --> 11:40.284
Yeah, they really are beautiful,
aren't they?

11:40.909 --> 11:43.871
-Oh, my God. She's checking you out.
-Oh, no.

11:43.954 --> 11:45.581
Oh, gosh. What do I do?

11:45.664 --> 11:46.874
Do I go over there?

11:46.957 --> 11:49.168
I think you're gonna blow it, man.
Just be cool.

11:50.544 --> 11:54.840
Is it too expected that my first date
after my divorce is with an alpaca?

11:58.844 --> 12:03.223
If you don't mind me asking,
what did happen between you and your ex?

12:04.308 --> 12:07.269
No, I mean, to be honest,
it's really not that great of a story.

12:07.978 --> 12:10.898
No one cheated.
No one was embezzling money.

12:10.981 --> 12:12.816
We just kind of grew apart.

12:13.567 --> 12:16.653
We started doing more and more things
on our own.

12:16.737 --> 12:19.031
I did a lot of hiking and bird-watching,

12:19.114 --> 12:23.952
and she got into ballroom dancing
and an entire ballroom dancing lifestyle.

12:24.036 --> 12:25.162
-Oh, no.
-Yeah.

12:25.245 --> 12:28.582
It eventually just got to a point
where we were, I don't know,

12:28.665 --> 12:30.751
more comfortable apart
than we were together.

12:31.418 --> 12:35.005
So, just a regular old boring divorce.

12:36.507 --> 12:38.509
It still doesn't make it
any less painful though.

12:38.592 --> 12:39.968
No, you're right.

12:40.052 --> 12:42.304
But we're good now.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.598
It's not so bad being on your own.

12:44.681 --> 12:49.645
Like, I can go on a hike for hours
and nobody wonders where I am.

12:49.728 --> 12:51.230
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

12:51.313 --> 12:53.774
That sounds so sad.

12:53.857 --> 12:56.109
Yeah. I realized it as soon as I said it.

12:56.193 --> 12:57.277
Don't worry.

12:57.361 --> 13:00.405
Sometimes I turn on the news and pretend
George Stephanopoulos is my husband.

13:01.240 --> 13:04.284
-That's pretty dark.
-Then, if I've had a glass of wine,

13:04.368 --> 13:07.913
I change the channel
and pretend Lester Holt is my sidepiece.

13:07.996 --> 13:11.500
-I took my mom as my date to a wedding.
-Oh, no!

13:11.583 --> 13:13.710
-Yeah.
-Why didn't you just not go?

13:13.794 --> 13:16.922
Something I realized
during "Back That Azz Up".

13:22.845 --> 13:24.388
-Oh, shoot.
-What is it?

13:24.471 --> 13:27.975
My wife-- ex-wife is stuck at work.

13:28.058 --> 13:30.978
She's asking if I can take our daughter
to her soccer game.

13:31.061 --> 13:33.647
-And what's the problem?
-Well, we're four hours away.

13:33.730 --> 13:36.733
I mean, I would never get there in time.

13:36.817 --> 13:39.695
Well, we're four hours away by car.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.537
What do you want from me, Lucas?

13:48.620 --> 13:50.330
It doesn't matter what I do.

13:50.414 --> 13:51.623
It's never enough!

13:51.707 --> 13:54.126
I want you to be there for me.

13:54.209 --> 13:56.378
This whole time you thought you were
running away

13:56.461 --> 14:01.091
from the ghost of your father, the mayor,
but you were running away from me.

14:03.302 --> 14:04.761
That's not fair.

14:04.845 --> 14:07.389
Fair's got nothing to do with it.

14:09.099 --> 14:11.602
I guess the engagement's off.

14:14.313 --> 14:16.899
Goddamn, that was powerful, man!

14:16.982 --> 14:18.275
That did feel really good, yeah.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.401
It was good.

14:19.484 --> 14:22.321
I mean, I swear, halfway through,
I didn't even see Nicholas.

14:22.404 --> 14:26.200
All I saw was Lucas Takahashi,
wounded romantic.

14:26.283 --> 14:28.744
Thanks. Do you wanna run it again?

14:28.827 --> 14:30.078
Well, yeah, if you want to.

14:30.162 --> 14:33.415
But, if I can tell you the truth,
you're ready.

14:33.498 --> 14:34.708
Ready for what?

14:35.209 --> 14:37.878
-For your audition.
-You still think I should go to that.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.047
No, I know you should go.

14:40.130 --> 14:42.174
I mean, you're gonna
crush that audition, Nicholas.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.552
Or should I say, Lucas?

14:49.598 --> 14:51.975
That roller coaster thing
was not her fault.

14:52.059 --> 14:55.062
That was her husband's fault.
You know what? I think he's slimy.

14:55.646 --> 14:58.857
Also, your boss is
in such a fascinating position

14:58.941 --> 15:01.902
as a billionaire
who also happens to be a woman of color.

15:01.985 --> 15:05.322
That's a lot of responsibility.
But she's handling it well.

15:06.156 --> 15:08.909
Yes, she is handling it well, sometimes.

15:08.992 --> 15:11.036
It just seems like she gets it.

15:11.119 --> 15:12.829
She just seems down.

15:12.913 --> 15:14.164
Right.

15:14.248 --> 15:18.168
That's what I think of Molly,
a very down… chick.

15:18.836 --> 15:20.254
-I knew it.
-You said that.

15:20.337 --> 15:23.966
Listen, we all can agree
that Molly is amazing,

15:24.049 --> 15:27.094
and she's really invested in the unhoused.

15:27.177 --> 15:29.847
She'd be so happy
to see this move forward.

16:03.213 --> 16:04.423
Dad?

16:07.426 --> 16:09.761
I can't believe this is my life right now.

16:09.845 --> 16:13.432
-Arden's gonna be so fucking jealous.
-Alex! Language. Come on.

16:13.515 --> 16:15.934
Sorry. I'm just so excited!

16:18.353 --> 16:21.231
-Thank you for doing this.
-Of course. It's no big deal.

16:23.108 --> 16:24.526
Do you want me to take one for you?

16:29.239 --> 16:30.532
-I think she's good.
-Yeah.

16:35.746 --> 16:38.874
No, I actually already booked that one,
and it is recurring.

16:40.876 --> 16:42.586
No, I'm not too worried about it.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.755
I've worked with this director before, so…

16:45.756 --> 16:47.758
And if anything,
I'm on hold for that other gig.

16:47.841 --> 16:50.385
So, if I don't book this,
we're still booked and busy.

16:50.469 --> 16:51.595
I'm not too worried.

16:53.430 --> 16:56.517
Okay, Nicholas.

17:04.650 --> 17:05.776
Oh, my gosh, guys!

17:05.858 --> 17:07.861
She said we can take it
to Cold Stone after!

17:10.030 --> 17:11.281
It was so much fun!

17:11.365 --> 17:13.200
You should see them
when I show up in my Corolla.

17:13.282 --> 17:14.367
Same reaction?

17:14.451 --> 17:16.161
Bigger, definitely.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.330
You want to stay for the game?

17:19.414 --> 17:20.874
Sure. Why not?

17:21.458 --> 17:22.459
All right.

17:58.495 --> 18:01.665
Hey. Sorry. I'm Nicholas. I think
I was supposed to be here a while ago.

18:01.748 --> 18:04.042
Yeah, we--
Well, we could take you now.

18:04.126 --> 18:05.794
-Are you ready?
-Yeah.

18:05.878 --> 18:07.129
All right. Let's go.

18:14.678 --> 18:16.054
Any news on the roller coaster?

18:16.138 --> 18:17.764
Oh, yeah. They got 'em all out last night.

18:17.848 --> 18:20.309
-Thank God!
-Yeah, and zero injuries.

18:20.392 --> 18:22.436
They're giving them all season passes.

18:23.145 --> 18:24.980
So, how did the meeting go yesterday?

18:25.063 --> 18:27.107
It actually went great.

18:27.191 --> 18:30.319
The city council's gonna put it into vote.
That's the first time that's happened.

18:30.402 --> 18:33.697
-It's a big win.
-That's amazing. Congratulations.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.240
What changed?

18:35.324 --> 18:38.869
Believe it or not, you.
They brought you up in the meeting.

18:38.952 --> 18:39.953
Oh, no.

18:40.037 --> 18:43.373
They saw that everyone pooped themselves
on what is technically my roller coaster?

18:43.457 --> 18:47.211
Molly, they all really like you. I think
it's because of what happened to you.

18:47.294 --> 18:49.505
People are really rooting for you, which…

18:51.089 --> 18:53.926
I understand, because so am I.

18:56.470 --> 18:57.679
Look at us.

18:58.222 --> 19:00.849
Two new besties.

19:00.933 --> 19:03.393
But we still need to be careful.
You're a public figure.

19:03.477 --> 19:06.230
People love a celebrity,
but they love to tear them down even more.

19:06.313 --> 19:08.023
-You're absolutely right about that.
-Yeah.

19:08.106 --> 19:11.068
So just keep that in mind
before you do literally anything.

19:11.151 --> 19:12.528
-I will.
-Okay.

19:14.696 --> 19:16.657
For example,
never go to a Halloween party.

19:16.740 --> 19:19.868
Never put on a costume of any kind.

19:19.952 --> 19:21.495
Of course. You got it.

19:24.706 --> 19:26.041
Bye, bestie.

19:29.628 --> 19:30.796
This makes so much sense.

19:30.879 --> 19:34.007
Her rising sign and his moon
are so compatible. It's so sweet.

19:34.091 --> 19:35.926
-Oh, Jesus.
-What are you guys looking at?

19:41.598 --> 19:43.559
-What the fuck?
-Listen, it's fine.

19:43.642 --> 19:44.768
I'm gonna make some calls,

19:44.852 --> 19:47.312
and we'll say that he won a contest
to spend time with you.

19:47.396 --> 19:50.774
Cousin Molly, why would you do this?
You don't have to date Arthur.

19:50.858 --> 19:53.402
You've got so much money,
you could buy any man.

19:53.485 --> 19:56.071
I mean, you could get Chris Hemsworth,
Liam Hemsworth.

19:56.154 --> 19:59.449
They'd probably make you a whole
new Hemsworth, give him a Gosling head.

19:59.533 --> 20:01.034
I am not dating Arthur.

20:01.118 --> 20:02.661
What are you guys looking at?

20:03.620 --> 20:06.498
-What is this?
-I had no idea these were taken.

20:06.582 --> 20:08.250
Don't worry.
They didn't publish the nudes.

20:08.333 --> 20:10.169
There aren't any nudes!

20:10.252 --> 20:11.795
Everyone, listen up!

20:11.879 --> 20:14.256
Just so there's no confusion.

20:14.339 --> 20:18.760
Yesterday, Arthur was helping me
go through some of my business holdings,

20:18.844 --> 20:20.846
and it was strictly a work thing,
all right?

20:20.929 --> 20:24.349
There was nothing romantic about it,
period.

20:24.433 --> 20:26.977
Yeah, Molly was just doing me a favor

20:27.060 --> 20:29.771
and giving me a ride
to my daughter's soccer game. That's it.

20:29.855 --> 20:33.275
Yeah, so just ignore all of that.
There's nothing going on.

20:33.358 --> 20:36.069
Everyone get back to work on their files
or whatever.

20:46.580 --> 20:48.832
-Hey, you wanted to see me?
-Yes. Come in.

20:53.712 --> 20:57.591
So, I wanted to say I'm sorry.

20:58.342 --> 21:01.303
The paparazzi are the worst,
and I shouldn't have dragged you

21:01.386 --> 21:03.847
-and your daughter into this.
-No, not at all.

21:03.931 --> 21:05.933
Alex is still raving about you.

21:06.517 --> 21:09.728
And I think people are overreacting.
Those photos are so innocent, you know?

21:10.979 --> 21:14.316
Although, I do hope
that the alpaca doesn't see them,

21:14.399 --> 21:17.069
because my chances with her
would be ruined.

21:19.696 --> 21:25.369
Just, as your boss, I wouldn't want people
to get the wrong idea.

21:25.869 --> 21:28.956
I think I get in enough trouble as it is.

21:30.582 --> 21:31.583
Right.

21:34.962 --> 21:39.591
All right, well, I guess
I will get back to work now, boss.

21:39.675 --> 21:40.676
Oh, yeah.

21:41.593 --> 21:43.512
Okay. Thank you.

21:43.595 --> 21:44.596
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
