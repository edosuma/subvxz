00:03.797 --> 00:08.457
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is it.

00:08.547 --> 00:10.515
They're about to announce
the ♪1 music video.

00:10.516 --> 00:12.037
I really hope it's ours.

00:12.038 --> 00:17.137
Your pick for the ♪1 music
video of the day is...

00:17.138 --> 00:19.066
Coming up right
after this break.

00:19.067 --> 00:21.559
- Oh, really?!
- Oh, come on!

00:21.560 --> 00:24.396
Guess who got a job
at Daisy's Bouquets?

00:24.397 --> 00:27.499
I did. It's a flower shop. I'll probably
get fired soon. So what'd I miss?

00:27.500 --> 00:31.503
Video Countdown Live is almost over and
still no sign of "No Ordinary Day".

00:31.504 --> 00:35.928
That means "No Ordinary Day" is either
♪ 1 or out of the top 10 completely.

00:35.929 --> 00:39.185
We can't be out. Yesterday we were ♪4.
The day before, ♪7.

00:39.186 --> 00:41.800
Before that, it was five, four,
eight, five, five, five, five...

00:41.801 --> 00:42.570
Dez!

00:42.571 --> 00:44.984
Or was that last part
my Nana's phone number?

00:44.985 --> 00:47.062
- Quiet! It's back on.
- Oh!

00:47.063 --> 00:48.296
America voted.

00:48.297 --> 00:51.033
The results are in.

00:51.034 --> 00:55.728
Your pick for the ♪1
video of the day is...

00:55.729 --> 00:59.629
"No Ordinary Day"
by Austin Moon!

01:03.914 --> 01:06.505
I can't believe it. I
directed a ♪1 video.

01:06.506 --> 01:07.983
Congrats, Dez!

01:07.984 --> 01:10.201
Austin, you and Kira look great.

01:10.202 --> 01:13.205
We're just lucky people can't smell
her breath through their TV,

01:13.206 --> 01:15.347
or there'd be no one left
to vote for the video.

01:15.348 --> 01:19.842
Sometimes in my dreams,
I can still smell it.

01:19.843 --> 01:22.695
It's a bummer. Kira
seems really cool.

01:22.696 --> 01:25.572
I'd totally ask her out if her
breath didn't smell like rotting...

01:25.573 --> 01:27.080
Oh, hey, Kira!

01:27.081 --> 01:30.441
Hey, guys. Congratulations.

01:31.359 --> 01:33.478
Wait. Say that again.

01:33.479 --> 01:34.860
Congratulations?

01:34.861 --> 01:38.532
One more time. A
little breathier.

01:38.533 --> 01:42.536
You guys are silly. It's
so good to see you.

01:42.537 --> 01:45.605
You too. Is there something
different about you?

01:45.606 --> 01:47.986
New hair, new dress,
new toothpaste?

01:47.987 --> 01:50.277
Mm, no. Same old me.

01:50.278 --> 01:52.885
Anyways, my dad knew your
video was gonna be ♪1

01:52.886 --> 01:55.831
and wanted me to give you these.

01:55.832 --> 01:58.518
"Congratulations. On
behalf of Starr Records,

01:58.519 --> 02:01.488
enjoy these four ultimate
wrestling tickets".

02:01.489 --> 02:03.257
- Awesome!
- Great!

02:03.258 --> 02:07.427
Oh, ultimate wrestling tickets,
something we can all enjoy.

02:07.428 --> 02:09.228
Eh.

02:09.859 --> 02:13.234
Hey. Let's all go celebrate
by getting pizza, on me.

02:13.235 --> 02:14.401
- Yes!
- Yeah.

02:14.402 --> 02:15.435
Wanna come with, Kira?

02:15.436 --> 02:19.032
Sure. As long as you promise not
to order garlic and anchovy.

02:19.033 --> 02:22.798
I used to eat it every day, but I
think it made my breath stink.

02:22.799 --> 02:23.893
No.

02:23.894 --> 02:25.645
- Are you kidding me?
- What?!

02:25.646 --> 02:27.515
Guys, remember? It was disgus...

02:27.516 --> 02:30.043
Tingly excellent.

Whoa! The zoom on my
new camera is amazing.

03:34.585 --> 03:38.722
By the way, Trish, I think you have a tiny
cavity on your upper left wisdom tooth.

03:38.723 --> 03:43.593
You have a giant cavity
where your brain should be.

03:43.594 --> 03:45.562
Kira, can I get you
another slice?

03:45.563 --> 03:48.402
Nope, still good with the
four you already gave me.

03:48.403 --> 03:50.466
Are they too hot? I can
blow on them for you.

03:50.467 --> 03:53.488
That's okay. I'm gonna
go grab some napkins.

03:53.489 --> 03:55.360
Use my shirt.

03:55.361 --> 03:59.036
I'll stick with paper
napkins, thanks.

03:59.037 --> 04:02.024
Guys, be honest...
am I acting weird?

04:02.025 --> 04:03.480
I wouldn't say weird.

04:03.481 --> 04:06.298
I'd say really weird.

04:06.299 --> 04:08.560
She's just so pretty.

04:08.561 --> 04:10.146
It's throwing off my whole game.

04:10.147 --> 04:14.324
What you need is someone to
subtly talk you up. Allow me.

04:14.325 --> 04:15.591
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

04:15.592 --> 04:18.428
How amazing is Austin?

04:18.430 --> 04:23.567
He's funny, talented, awesome
dancer, can count to 10 in Spanish.

04:23.568 --> 04:26.328
Has amazing hair.

04:26.604 --> 04:30.407
- What am I forgetting?
- Just the subtlety part.

04:30.408 --> 04:32.709
You're right, Ally.
He's a good one.

04:32.710 --> 04:35.601
Well, I gotta run.
Thanks for lunch.

04:35.602 --> 04:36.861
Bye.

04:36.862 --> 04:38.622
- Bye.
- Bye.

04:38.623 --> 04:41.385
I should probably go too. I
have to get back to the store.

04:41.386 --> 04:43.653
Okay, I'm definitely
asking her out.

04:43.654 --> 04:47.491
Uh, whoa. Bad idea. You can't
date your boss' daughter.

04:47.492 --> 04:50.327
- But I like her.
- I say go for it.

04:50.328 --> 04:54.014
Follow your heart. Don't let
anyone get in your way.

04:54.015 --> 04:57.066
Dez, you're in my way.

04:57.067 --> 04:58.255
Hey, Trish.

04:58.256 --> 05:01.899
I was thinking, since you and Ally
aren't crazy about Jimmy Starr's gift,

05:01.900 --> 05:04.259
how about you put together
a small bouquet for Ally

05:04.260 --> 05:06.410
and get yourself something too.
I'll pay.

05:06.411 --> 05:08.545
Really? Thank you.

05:08.546 --> 05:12.449
Forget the flowers. I suggest using the
money to get that tooth looked at.

05:12.450 --> 05:14.719
Ugh. Say "ah".

05:14.720 --> 05:15.789
Ah.

05:15.790 --> 05:17.590
Ah!

05:22.693 --> 05:26.230
Okay, put your fingers on this
fret and your pinky down here.

05:26.231 --> 05:27.691
Now strum.

05:27.692 --> 05:33.592
And playing guitar isn't easy, so don't
worry if you don't get it the first time.

05:36.407 --> 05:38.327
Whoa!

05:38.510 --> 05:41.344
You're a quick learner.

05:41.345 --> 05:43.347
I've been playing
since I was four.

05:43.348 --> 05:47.816
I just thought it was cute how
excited you were to teach me.

05:47.817 --> 05:49.442
Thanks.

05:49.443 --> 05:54.543
So, Kira, I was wondering
if maybe you'd wanna...

05:54.592 --> 05:56.932
You know...

05:57.890 --> 05:59.396
Go out sometime?

05:59.397 --> 06:01.048
Like on a date.

06:01.049 --> 06:04.744
A date? Are you being serious?

06:04.745 --> 06:08.372
Huh. Not exactly the
response I was looking for.

06:08.373 --> 06:12.018
No, it's just that I thought
you and Ally liked each other.

06:12.019 --> 06:13.999
What?!

06:14.343 --> 06:17.381
Me and Ally? No way!

06:17.382 --> 06:20.109
You sure? Because I've never
seen a guy and girl spend so

06:20.110 --> 06:22.519
much time together that weren't
boyfriend and girlfriend.

06:22.520 --> 06:25.230
Trust me, Ally and I
are just friends.

06:25.231 --> 06:29.276
We like each other a lot,
but not in that way.

06:29.277 --> 06:32.885
All right. As long as there's nothing
going on between you and Ally...

06:32.886 --> 06:36.066
I'll go out with you.

06:39.763 --> 06:43.540
Austin, here are the flowers
you ordered for Ally.

06:43.541 --> 06:45.375
It's not what it looks like.

06:45.376 --> 06:48.590
I just ordered some flowers to thank
her for writing the song for my video.

06:48.591 --> 06:51.471
Oh! And some more.

06:52.263 --> 06:54.267
It was the ♪1 video.

06:54.268 --> 06:56.968
Ah, and another.

06:57.347 --> 06:59.985
Whoa! Who's got a
secret admirer?

06:59.986 --> 07:02.904
These are the flowers
Austin got for Ally.

07:02.905 --> 07:06.563
Austin's Ally's secret admirer.

07:06.564 --> 07:09.969
No. I just wanted a small gift.

07:09.970 --> 07:12.909
This is your idea
of a small gift?

07:12.910 --> 07:16.871
Well, when it comes to Austin and
Ally, no gesture is too big.

07:16.872 --> 07:18.936
They have a special
relationship.

07:18.937 --> 07:21.799
Oh, my gosh. Who are
all the flowers for?

07:21.800 --> 07:24.560
They're for you.

07:25.350 --> 07:27.737
Really? From who?

07:27.738 --> 07:29.538
Me.

07:31.556 --> 07:35.225
"There's no way I can
make it without you".

07:35.226 --> 07:38.309
Aw, thank you so much, Austin.

07:38.310 --> 07:42.150
This is the sweetest thing ever.

07:42.689 --> 07:48.184
Kira, step aside please. I need a
clear shot of our happy couple.

07:48.185 --> 07:51.840
- Kira, wait! I can explain!
- Whoa, slow down! Still hugging here.

07:51.841 --> 07:54.466
It's okay. I see
what's going on.

07:54.467 --> 07:56.687
You two clearly have
feelings for each other and,

07:56.688 --> 07:58.406
your friends want
you together too.

07:58.407 --> 08:01.579
What? N-no. It's not like that.

08:01.580 --> 08:04.018
It's all good, Ally. I'm
not gonna get in the way.

08:04.019 --> 08:07.559
Let's just forget the date.

08:08.924 --> 08:12.671
Trish, I told you to get a simple
bouquet, not the whole store.

08:12.672 --> 08:15.470
You told me to get
something for myself too.

08:15.471 --> 08:18.395
And I get a bonus for
every flower I sell.

08:18.396 --> 08:20.916
So thank you.

08:28.762 --> 08:30.462
Thanks for shopping
at Sonic Boom.

08:30.463 --> 08:31.359
Ooh!

08:31.360 --> 08:35.096
Don't forget your
complementary bouquet.

08:35.097 --> 08:38.087
I still can't believe you're
just giving all of these away.

08:38.087 --> 08:39.422
I'm drowning in flowers.

08:39.423 --> 08:42.057
I love them, but what else am
I supposed to do with them?

08:42.058 --> 08:46.095
Yeah, I'm running out
of ideas over here.

08:46.096 --> 08:48.878
I've texted Kira five times
and she won't respond.

08:48.879 --> 08:50.099
What else can I do?

08:50.100 --> 08:55.137
You can give her one of these
stylish wrist corsages I made.

08:55.138 --> 08:56.838
I don't think so, Dez.

08:56.839 --> 08:59.719
Teddy bear topiary?

09:00.076 --> 09:01.609
Maybe it's for the best.

09:01.610 --> 09:05.080
I still don't think it's a good idea for
you to date Jimmy Starr's daughter.

09:05.081 --> 09:06.466
But...

09:06.467 --> 09:08.807
I want to.

09:10.053 --> 09:12.087
Well, if you want Kira
to go out with you,

09:12.088 --> 09:15.291
you need to do something super
romantic to show her how you feel.

09:15.292 --> 09:16.667
Uh, hello.

09:16.668 --> 09:18.399
Teddy bear topiary?

09:18.400 --> 09:21.640
"Go out with me, Kira".

09:22.344 --> 09:25.164
- Dez.
- No? Okay.

09:26.903 --> 09:29.071
This whole mess is
partly my fault.

09:29.072 --> 09:31.466
Let me help you plan
the perfect date.

09:31.467 --> 09:33.344
We can plan all we want,
but there won't be

09:33.356 --> 09:35.244
a date if she won't
answer any of my texts.

09:35.245 --> 09:38.504
Don't worry, man. I'll find a way
to get her to go out with you.

09:38.505 --> 09:40.722
I can be very persuasive.

09:40.723 --> 09:42.703
Watch.

09:43.484 --> 09:44.627
Give me $10.

09:44.628 --> 09:46.428
No.

09:46.724 --> 09:48.324
Okay.

09:48.325 --> 09:50.943
Then don't give me $10.

09:50.944 --> 09:53.128
I won't.

09:53.129 --> 09:55.769
See? Persuasive.

10:02.487 --> 10:05.289
Okay, so what's our big plan?

10:05.290 --> 10:08.459
Well, let's tackle it like
we're writing a song.

10:08.460 --> 10:10.807
I mean, you and I make
great music together.

10:10.808 --> 10:13.074
We should be able to come
up with a great date.

10:13.075 --> 10:14.712
That's true.

10:14.713 --> 10:17.719
Tell me what your
perfect date would be.

10:17.720 --> 10:21.063
We'd go to a zombie convention,
grab some pancakes,

10:21.064 --> 10:25.467
and then play video games
in Dez's basement.

10:25.468 --> 10:29.188
What? He's got an awesome TV.

10:29.364 --> 10:31.331
Austin, it's gotta be special.

10:31.332 --> 10:33.601
This isn't a guys' night out.

10:33.602 --> 10:36.182
Picture this...

10:36.538 --> 10:40.041
A picnic under the stars, a
romantic movie's playing.

10:40.042 --> 10:44.122
Ooh! Like "Bikini
Beach Blood Bash"!

10:45.171 --> 10:48.415
Um, I'm thinking
even more romantic.

10:48.416 --> 10:51.218
Ooh! "Bikini Beach
Blood Bash II"...

10:51.219 --> 10:54.099
Babes in Barbados".

10:54.456 --> 10:57.458
More like "Le
Voyage De L'amour".

10:57.459 --> 10:59.945
It's a silent movie playing
in the park tomorrow.

10:59.946 --> 11:01.986
Silent?

11:02.035 --> 11:05.192
Is it at least in 3D?

11:05.193 --> 11:08.793
Austin, be serious. Imagine...

11:10.198 --> 11:12.421
Kira's there.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.445
Her eyes sparkling
in the moonlight...

11:14.446 --> 11:17.159
Sparkle sparkle sparkle sparkle.

11:17.160 --> 11:19.349
A gentle breeze
blowing her hair...

11:19.350 --> 11:22.419
Breeze breeze breeze breeze.

11:22.420 --> 11:25.606
What can you do to
show her how you feel?

11:25.607 --> 11:28.004
Well, I could give her a gift.

11:28.005 --> 11:33.626
Ooh! I'll get her a necklace
with her name on it. Like yours.

11:33.627 --> 11:35.971
Perfect. She'll love that.

11:35.972 --> 11:37.732
Okay, so...

11:37.733 --> 11:40.304
I'll wait for the most
romantic part of the movie.

11:40.305 --> 11:42.652
She'll be all cute and lovey.

11:42.653 --> 11:45.842
I'll lean in, put
my arm around her.

11:45.843 --> 11:49.671
She'll nuzzle up,
feeling butterflies.

11:49.672 --> 11:52.190
My heart will be beating
out of my chest.

11:52.191 --> 11:54.106
It'll be...

11:54.107 --> 11:57.047
- Perfect.
- Perfect.

12:04.755 --> 12:06.644
I know how to get
Kira to your date!

12:06.645 --> 12:09.770
Fishing net, tranquilizer dart.

12:09.771 --> 12:11.368
Oh!

12:11.369 --> 12:13.469
Awesome!

12:20.345 --> 12:21.966
Trish.

12:21.967 --> 12:24.720
Check out what I got for
Austin's date with Kira.

12:24.721 --> 12:27.961
A cozy picnic blanket...

12:28.058 --> 12:30.004
A jar of pickles.

12:30.005 --> 12:31.255
I like Austin.

12:31.256 --> 12:32.706
Heart-shaped salamis...

12:32.707 --> 12:35.128
Wait. Say that again.

12:35.129 --> 12:37.147
Heart-shaped salamis?

12:37.148 --> 12:40.720
No, the part about
you liking Austin!

12:40.721 --> 12:42.040
Oh.

12:42.041 --> 12:44.190
Right. That.

12:44.191 --> 12:47.191
Yeah. I like Austin.

12:48.316 --> 12:50.708
Ally, this is huge!

12:50.709 --> 12:52.999
- What happened?
- I don't know.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.082
We were pretending we were on the perfect
date and all of a sudden it felt like...

12:57.083 --> 13:00.683
We were on the perfect date.

13:00.866 --> 13:02.586
Trish.

13:02.587 --> 13:05.189
What should I do?
I'm freaking out.

13:05.190 --> 13:09.852
Well, for starters, I wouldn't help
him plan a date for another girl.

13:09.853 --> 13:12.600
You need to tell
Austin you like him.

13:12.601 --> 13:14.331
But he likes Kira.

13:14.332 --> 13:17.789
Maybe he wouldn't if
he knew how you felt.

13:17.790 --> 13:22.372
If I say something and he doesn't feel the
same way, everything will be ruined...

13:22.373 --> 13:25.542
Our friendship, our
partnership, everything.

13:25.543 --> 13:27.915
Please promise me you
won't say anything.

13:27.916 --> 13:31.456
Your secret's safe with me.

13:35.079 --> 13:37.387
I have to tell someone!

13:37.388 --> 13:39.240
Hey, stranger!

13:39.241 --> 13:41.820
Ally likes Austin!

13:41.821 --> 13:43.176
Okay.

13:43.177 --> 13:47.017
Now your secret's safe with me.

13:53.130 --> 13:56.214
Okay, I got everything
together for Austin's date.

13:56.215 --> 13:59.217
He said he wants to give Kira a
necklace just like my "Ally" one,

13:59.218 --> 14:02.354
so I had the jewelry
store copy mine.

14:02.355 --> 14:05.190
You should have gotten one
for yourself that says,

14:05.191 --> 14:09.229
"I'm not even going to try to
go after the boy of my dreams".

14:09.230 --> 14:12.230
That would never fit on a chain.

14:12.231 --> 14:14.299
- Hey, guys.
- Oh!

14:14.300 --> 14:18.639
All right, Austin. You're all
set for your perfect date.

14:18.640 --> 14:22.232
Thanks for doing all this for me, Ally.
You're a good friend.

14:22.233 --> 14:24.308
No problem.

14:24.309 --> 14:26.289
Buddy.

14:27.791 --> 14:31.316
So Dez, how'd you get Kira to agree
to show up at the park anyway?

14:31.317 --> 14:34.219
I've spent the last 24 hours
collecting Kira data.

14:34.220 --> 14:38.256
Her MyFace page, school schedule,
family tree, shoe size.

14:38.257 --> 14:41.193
- Did that help?
- Not at all.

14:41.194 --> 14:45.397
But she did agree to meet with me
to discuss a role in my next film.

14:45.398 --> 14:50.402
She is going to be disappointed
when she sees Austin.

14:50.403 --> 14:52.777
I'll take my chances.

14:52.778 --> 14:55.340
Well, I better go
to my perfect date.

14:55.341 --> 14:57.840
Don't wanna keep the
perfect girl waiting.

14:57.841 --> 15:01.911
Sometimes the perfect girl
is closer than you think.

15:01.912 --> 15:07.492
Not really. The park's a good
20-minute walk from here.

15:08.378 --> 15:09.287
Thanks again, Ally.

15:09.288 --> 15:12.124
I'm gonna make sure Kira knows how
much you helped with all this.

15:12.125 --> 15:14.931
There's no way she'll still
think we like each other.

15:14.932 --> 15:17.392
No way, pal.

15:17.396 --> 15:20.456
Ow! Stop punching me.

15:24.369 --> 15:27.339
You really need to work
on your fake laugh.

15:27.340 --> 15:29.459
I need to work on
my fake laugh too.

15:29.460 --> 15:31.343
<i>♪ Ha-ha ha-ha ha-ha ha-ha, ha.</i>

15:31.344 --> 15:33.804
<i>♪ Ha ha...</i>

15:34.887 --> 15:38.416
I genuinely want them to have
a great time on their picnic.

15:38.417 --> 15:40.418
Then I hoped he packed
lots of vegetables.

15:40.419 --> 15:42.871
Well, there's some pickles.

15:42.872 --> 15:44.465
But mostly meat, why?

15:44.466 --> 15:46.468
- Kira doesn't eat meat.
- What?

15:46.469 --> 15:48.619
She has a very
detailed MyFace page.

15:48.620 --> 15:50.836
Check it out.

15:50.837 --> 15:54.786
Look! "Old movies are boring.
Grass makes me itch".

15:54.787 --> 15:57.812
"The smell of pickles
makes me want to puke".

15:57.813 --> 16:00.387
Oh, no! The date I
planned is all wrong.

16:00.388 --> 16:02.704
Kira's gonna think I
sabotaged it on purpose.

16:02.705 --> 16:04.639
Um, Ally?

16:04.640 --> 16:07.343
Why are you wearing a necklace
that says "Kira" on it?

16:07.344 --> 16:09.264
What?

16:09.279 --> 16:10.545
Oh, no!

16:10.546 --> 16:12.878
I must have put the wrong
one in the basket!

16:12.879 --> 16:16.136
Which means Austin's gonna
give Kira the one that says...

16:16.137 --> 16:17.519
"Ally"!

16:17.520 --> 16:20.689
Relax, I'll just call Austin
and tell him everything.

16:20.690 --> 16:25.273
You can't call. I told him to leave his
phone here, so he could focus on Kira.

16:25.274 --> 16:26.224
Shoot!

16:26.225 --> 16:29.888
No biggie. I'll just text him.

16:29.889 --> 16:32.949
There. Problem solved.

16:35.109 --> 16:39.309
Ally, I think you're
getting a text.

16:41.000 --> 16:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

16:48.204 --> 16:49.467
Kira.

16:49.468 --> 16:52.207
Austin, I'm supposed
to be meeting Dez.

16:52.208 --> 16:54.099
What are you doing here?

16:54.100 --> 16:57.362
Proving that I don't like
Ally the way I like you.

16:57.363 --> 17:00.508
- Austin, I don't...
- Give me a chance. Please.

17:00.509 --> 17:03.262
Just watch one silent movie
with me in the park.

17:03.263 --> 17:05.522
Silent movie?

17:05.523 --> 17:08.523
Here? On this grass?

17:09.044 --> 17:12.385
Romantic, right? Ally helped
me plan the whole thing.

17:12.386 --> 17:14.720
Oh, Ally planned it?

17:14.721 --> 17:17.060
Interesting.

17:19.326 --> 17:23.046
Oh look, the movie's starting.

17:28.502 --> 17:30.290
Why are we sneaking around?

17:30.291 --> 17:33.426
Let's just give Austin Kira's necklace
and tell him to scrap the picnic.

17:33.427 --> 17:37.021
We can't. Kira thinks we all want
me and Austin to be together.

17:37.022 --> 17:40.604
If she sees us here, it'll look like we
planned this disaster date on purpose.

17:40.605 --> 17:46.185
Then I'll just toss him his
phone and we can text him.

17:47.342 --> 17:49.051
Hey!

17:49.052 --> 17:50.277
You throwing stuff at me?

17:50.278 --> 17:53.547
Uh, it came from back there.

17:53.548 --> 17:55.752
Well, it better
not happen again.

17:55.753 --> 18:00.853
Le Voyage De L'amour is
my favorite silent flick.

18:02.137 --> 18:04.010
Nice aim, you doof.

18:04.011 --> 18:07.363
Guys, focus. That basket is
full of things Kira hates.

18:07.364 --> 18:09.496
- It's up to us...
- Shh!

18:09.497 --> 18:11.499
- We're watching a movie here.
- But I didn't...

18:11.500 --> 18:13.300
Eh!

18:17.105 --> 18:18.525
Ally, look.

18:18.526 --> 18:20.543
Meathead's packing fruit.

18:20.544 --> 18:24.278
If we can somehow get his basket from
him, then we can switch it with Austin's.

18:24.279 --> 18:26.744
Yes! Then I can put
Kira's necklace in it,

18:26.745 --> 18:29.349
and Austin will be able to make
the most of the rest of his date!

18:29.350 --> 18:31.092
Perfect! I'll create
a distraction.

18:31.093 --> 18:35.713
Then I'll crawl over
and swap the baskets.

18:39.531 --> 18:41.663
What's taking Dez so long?

18:41.664 --> 18:44.198
Forget it. I'm gonna crawl over
there and switch the baskets.

18:44.199 --> 18:46.366
- Do you want me to go with you?
- No, that's okay.

18:46.367 --> 18:50.507
Good, because I don't
like crawling.

18:55.622 --> 18:57.369
Oh!

18:57.370 --> 18:59.230
Oof!

19:03.707 --> 19:05.385
Oh, man.

19:05.386 --> 19:09.646
This part gets me
every stinking time.

19:15.396 --> 19:16.891
You sure you're all right?

19:16.892 --> 19:18.624
Yup, this is great.

19:18.625 --> 19:22.261
Ally sure knows
what a girl likes.

19:22.262 --> 19:23.924
Ooh!

19:23.925 --> 19:27.407
How about I make you one of my triple
decker meat lover's sandwiches?

19:27.408 --> 19:29.660
Sorry, I don't eat meat.

19:29.661 --> 19:31.386
Oh. Okay.

19:31.387 --> 19:34.481
How about some pickles?

19:34.482 --> 19:37.359
Pickles make me sick.

19:37.360 --> 19:41.100
I'm pretty sure Ally just
packed pickles and meat...

19:41.101 --> 19:46.621
And fruit and carrot sticks
and this homemade fettuccine.

19:49.197 --> 19:52.499
Hey! That's my mom's
famous fettuccine.

19:52.500 --> 19:54.335
This is ours. Leave us alone.

19:54.336 --> 19:56.178
- Give me...
- Give it to me!

19:56.179 --> 20:00.859
- I'm gonna miss the ending.
- Come on man!

20:03.044 --> 20:06.376
Oh! You made me
miss the proposal.

20:06.377 --> 20:10.637
Come on, Adrienne.
Let's get of here.

20:10.784 --> 20:14.727
Looks like meathead's girlfriend just got
herself a brand-new "Kira" necklace.

20:14.728 --> 20:20.628
Well, at least I got the "Ally" one
before Austin gave it to Kira.

20:22.430 --> 20:24.331
Oh, no! It's not in here.

20:24.332 --> 20:26.969
Austin must have taken it out
before I switched the baskets.

20:26.970 --> 20:29.834
Uh, Ally? He definitely did.

20:29.835 --> 20:32.052
I'm so sorry.

20:32.053 --> 20:35.795
This date's been a nightmare,
but maybe this will help.

20:35.796 --> 20:37.166
Wait!

20:37.167 --> 20:38.345
Ally?

20:38.346 --> 20:40.769
Why am I not surprised?
And that's my gift.

20:40.770 --> 20:42.483
It's not yours, it's mine.

20:42.484 --> 20:44.142
- Listen...
- Don't bother.

20:44.143 --> 20:45.943
Thanks for planning
this date for us, Ally.

20:45.944 --> 20:48.629
I think it turned out
exactly how you wanted.

20:48.630 --> 20:50.804
That's not true! I can explain.

20:50.805 --> 20:53.745
It's funny, really.

20:57.914 --> 20:59.782
Now that's a distraction!

20:59.783 --> 21:02.279
The sprinklers were
your distraction?

21:02.280 --> 21:05.271
- You're welcome.
- Oh!

21:05.272 --> 21:07.072
Ah!

21:11.967 --> 21:15.255
I completely destroyed Austin's date.
I feel horrible.

21:15.256 --> 21:16.662
Look on the bright side.

21:16.663 --> 21:20.071
There's no way Austin and Kira
are going on a second date.

21:20.072 --> 21:24.817
That was the best date ever! I
can't wait to go on a second date.

21:24.818 --> 21:27.322
Wait, you guys had a good time?

21:27.323 --> 21:29.429
After we dried off, we
grabbed some pancakes,

21:29.430 --> 21:31.653
and played video games
in Dez's basement!

21:31.654 --> 21:34.354
He has an awesome TV!

21:34.355 --> 21:37.064
So I keep hearing.

21:37.065 --> 21:40.136
Ally, I'm sorry I thought
you liked Austin.

21:40.137 --> 21:44.434
What you did to try and save the
date tonight proves you don't.

21:44.435 --> 21:47.435
Yup, that proves it.

21:53.146 --> 21:56.026
Thanks again, Ally.

22:01.867 --> 22:03.958
Are you okay?

22:03.959 --> 22:06.776
I'm fine. I promise.

22:06.777 --> 22:09.618
Well, there's no use wasting
a perfectly good picnic.

22:09.619 --> 22:11.816
Let's go upstairs and dig in.

22:11.817 --> 22:13.925
I'll meet you up there. I
just have to close up shop.

22:13.926 --> 22:15.846
Okay.

22:33.280 --> 22:38.020
"There's no way I can
make it without you".

23:04.529 --> 23:06.880
Heart shaped salami?

23:06.881 --> 23:09.278
I thought you'd never ask.

23:09.279 --> 23:11.987
Too bad Dez isn't here to
help us finish all this.

23:11.988 --> 23:15.588
- Where is Dez anyway?
- Hmm.

23:18.147 --> 23:23.105
Oh, Claudette just tell
him you love him already!
