WEBVTT

00:13.538 --> 00:14.455
Look out!
Move it.

00:14.455 --> 00:15.748
Councilwoman?

00:15.748 --> 00:17.834
Councilwoman Escalante?

00:19.919 --> 00:22.004
Relationship with Abby ...
was she more than a housekeeper?

00:25.800 --> 00:27.176
Was she more than
a housekeeper?

00:27.176 --> 00:27.969
Councilwoman?

00:27.969 --> 00:30.304
... how will your
husband's murder trial...

00:30.304 --> 00:31.639
affect your
reelection campaign?

00:40.022 --> 00:42.650
Stop! Let me go!

00:42.650 --> 00:44.736
I'm going to tell your wife!

01:27.403 --> 01:28.613
Take your seats.

01:28.613 --> 01:30.823
Court will be in session
in five minutes.

01:34.077 --> 01:35.119
Straighten your tie.

01:44.128 --> 01:46.422
Hey, Horatio,
we got a problem.

01:47.465 --> 01:50.301
Speed, I'm under subpoena.
I'm about to testify.

01:50.927 --> 01:52.178
You might want
to reconsider that.

01:52.178 --> 01:54.138
Remember that call I
rolled out on this morning?

01:54.138 --> 01:55.515
The Jane Doe?

01:55.515 --> 01:56.974
She was familiar.

01:57.600 --> 01:58.768
How familiar?

01:59.811 --> 02:01.646
Young, pretty Latina.

02:01.646 --> 02:04.023
Single gunshot,
close range, left temple.

02:08.777 --> 02:09.821
Okay.

02:15.618 --> 02:17.829
Alexx, Jane Doe?

02:17.829 --> 02:19.205
I just got her, Horatio.

02:19.205 --> 02:20.998
I'll have results within the hour.

02:20.998 --> 02:23.084
Okay, Alexx, I need
something right now.

02:31.300 --> 02:33.386
Mint leaves in
her stomach.

02:35.388 --> 02:36.806
Swallowed whole.

02:37.098 --> 02:39.600
I'm guessing tox will say
they're from a mojito,

02:39.600 --> 02:40.852
just like Abby Sandoval.

02:40.852 --> 02:42.228
Okay, thank you.

02:48.568 --> 02:49.902
There's a flag
on the play, Don.

02:49.902 --> 02:51.195
I can't testify today.

02:51.195 --> 02:52.321
Why the hell not?

02:52.321 --> 02:55.116
I've got a family emergency.
My grandmother's ill.

02:55.116 --> 02:56.784
You were the last
nail in the coffin.

02:56.784 --> 02:57.702
That's why I've
been saving...

02:57.702 --> 02:58.536
you for last.
I understand that,

02:58.536 --> 03:00.663
but I need more time.
I've got none to give you.

03:00.663 --> 03:03.040
Don, I need you
to make more time.

03:05.126 --> 03:08.504
Your grandma better be
bleeding from her eyeballs.

03:08.504 --> 03:10.256
Twenty-four hours.
Okay.

03:23.895 --> 03:25.772
Fastest scalp on the east.

03:25.772 --> 03:29.108
I think I just set some kind
of postmortem speed record.

03:29.108 --> 03:31.027
Is she that similar
to Abby Sandoval?

03:31.027 --> 03:32.570
Like looking in the mirror.

03:37.241 --> 03:38.951
Both victims in
their early 20s.

03:38.951 --> 03:41.120
Pretty, Latina,
shot once in the head,

03:41.120 --> 03:43.748
left temple,
mint leaves in the stomach,

03:43.748 --> 03:45.124
both worked with their hands.

03:45.124 --> 03:46.209
Now,

03:46.209 --> 03:48.711
I'm thinking Jane Doe here
may have been a domestic,

03:48.711 --> 03:49.587
just like Abby was.

03:49.587 --> 03:51.756
She couldn't have been
killed by Lorenzo Escalante,

03:51.756 --> 03:54.759
because he was in custody
at the time of her death.

03:55.384 --> 03:56.469
How are they different?

03:56.469 --> 03:59.680
Abby Sandoval has glass
frag in her wound track.

03:59.680 --> 04:02.892
Not surprising since she was shot
through the window of her car.

04:02.892 --> 04:05.436
Didn't find any
glass on Jane Doe.

04:05.436 --> 04:06.479
Where did you find her?

04:06.479 --> 04:08.898
Dumped roadside, no car.

04:08.898 --> 04:11.567
Or maybe we haven't
found her car yet.

04:12.610 --> 04:14.195
You thinking we
got a serial?

04:14.195 --> 04:15.446
I don't know.

04:15.446 --> 04:19.117
But we better find out before we
send an innocent man to jail for murder.

04:55.194 --> 04:58.322
1x17 Simple Man

05:07.163 --> 05:08.289
Nice shot.

05:08.915 --> 05:09.707
Hey.

05:09.707 --> 05:11.084
You busy?

05:11.084 --> 05:13.378
Oh, I'm up to
my ass in alligators.

05:13.378 --> 05:16.047
There was a big shooting
on the causeway yesterday.

05:16.047 --> 05:18.007
Fifty-four expended rounds.

05:18.007 --> 05:19.342
Not to mention,

05:19.342 --> 05:22.637
Detective Hagen is riding me
like a gulfstream park pony.

05:22.637 --> 05:23.721
John Hagen?

05:23.721 --> 05:24.973
Yeah.

05:28.101 --> 05:30.979
Listen, I need a favor.

05:31.271 --> 05:32.647
Sure.

05:34.732 --> 05:37.026
Nine mil, hollow point.

05:37.026 --> 05:38.319
It's brass-jacketed.

05:38.319 --> 05:40.697
So my guess is it's
a golden talon.

05:41.739 --> 05:42.782
Here's what I need.

05:42.782 --> 05:45.618
I'd like to lift the bullet from
the Abby Sandoval case...

05:45.618 --> 05:46.703
and compare it to that.

05:46.703 --> 05:48.788
Isn't that case
on trial right now?

05:52.959 --> 05:55.044
Okay. Quickly and quietly.

05:55.044 --> 05:56.087
Thank you.

06:25.575 --> 06:26.534
What'd you get?

06:26.868 --> 06:29.954
Denise, the court reporter,
told me that Escalante's lawyers...

06:29.954 --> 06:31.205
have been filing
motions all morning.

06:31.205 --> 06:32.874
It means they're moving to get
the case thrown out of court,

06:32.874 --> 06:34.626
so we have to work fast.
Here you go.

06:34.626 --> 06:35.460
Jane Doe's clothes?

06:35.460 --> 06:36.628
Tape it and scrape it.

06:36.628 --> 06:37.754
You know what
we're looking for, right?

06:37.754 --> 06:40.173
Two fibers we found
on Abby Sandoval.

06:40.173 --> 06:41.883
Worsted wool and
tropical weight.

06:41.883 --> 06:42.759
Exactly right.

06:42.759 --> 06:44.886
Just like Escalante's
$2,000 suits.

06:44.886 --> 06:46.346
Speed, keep me posted.

06:48.848 --> 06:49.641
Eric.

06:49.641 --> 06:50.475
H.

06:51.517 --> 06:53.269
Listen, sorry to bug you
on your day off.

06:53.269 --> 06:54.062
It's not a problem.

06:54.062 --> 06:56.022
I was, uh, thinking of doing
some diving anyway.

06:56.022 --> 06:58.149
Might as well do it
on the county time, huh?

06:58.566 --> 07:00.026
One question.
What's that?

07:00.026 --> 07:02.445
Speedle's Jane Doe --
she wasn't a floater.

07:02.445 --> 07:05.031
Why do you want me to bring
my dive gear to the crime scene?

07:05.031 --> 07:06.449
Abby Sandoval.

07:08.534 --> 07:09.535
Sandoval?

07:10.578 --> 07:11.955
I thought that investigation
was closed.

07:11.955 --> 07:13.498
Officially it is.

07:13.915 --> 07:14.916
Horatio?

07:15.458 --> 07:17.168
I'll meet you out there.
Yeah?

07:17.794 --> 07:18.920
How's grandma?

07:18.920 --> 07:21.673
It's too soon to tell.
Still running tests.

07:21.673 --> 07:22.924
Anything you'd like to share?

07:22.924 --> 07:25.343
Not just yet.
Grandma likes her privacy.

07:25.343 --> 07:26.886
You want to know
what I really like?

07:26.886 --> 07:27.679
What's that?

07:27.679 --> 07:30.306
I like smoking a
Monte Cristo number two...

07:30.306 --> 07:31.975
after winning a
slam-dunk case.

07:31.975 --> 07:34.102
Your grandma wouldn't be trying
to screw me out of a good cigar?

07:34.102 --> 07:35.561
Want to make sure
that we find the right guy.

07:35.561 --> 07:36.938
We've got the right guy.

07:36.938 --> 07:38.398
Lorenzo Escalante.

07:38.398 --> 07:39.774
He had an affair with the maid.

07:39.774 --> 07:41.234
He admits to getting
rough with her.

07:41.234 --> 07:44.404
Got his semen inside of her,
his DNA under her fingernails.

07:44.404 --> 07:46.364
Yes, Don, but we
don't have the gun.

07:46.364 --> 07:48.741
Look, Horatio,
we're on the same side.

07:48.741 --> 07:49.534
I'd like to think so.

07:49.534 --> 07:52.328
Yeah, well, we are
in the middle of the trial.

07:52.328 --> 07:53.454
We've already picked the jury.

07:53.454 --> 07:54.664
We've called our experts.

07:54.664 --> 07:57.250
We spent over a million
dollars in taxpayers' money.

07:57.250 --> 07:58.459
We have new evidence.

07:58.459 --> 08:00.753
Yeah, well, that's what
appeals are all about.

08:00.753 --> 08:02.630
Listen, this is not about
the case anymore.

08:02.630 --> 08:03.965
Now, it's about winning.

08:03.965 --> 08:05.383
Well, you know what then?

08:05.383 --> 08:07.260
We're not on the
same side.

08:17.478 --> 08:18.354
H.

08:18.354 --> 08:19.355
What do we got?

08:19.355 --> 08:22.233
Park Ranger found our Jane
Doe on the side of the road.

08:22.233 --> 08:23.318
Okay.

08:24.986 --> 08:26.279
Here we go.

08:26.821 --> 08:27.989
All right.

08:28.740 --> 08:29.824
Well, she wasn't killed here.

08:29.824 --> 08:32.159
There's not enough blood
for a head shot, right?

08:32.159 --> 08:33.035
She could have
been dumped.

08:33.035 --> 08:35.621
I've got a couple of guys on the
road preserving some tread marks.

08:35.621 --> 08:37.081
Okay.
Eric?

08:41.126 --> 08:42.128
Check this out.

08:43.587 --> 08:44.839
All right, blood trail.

08:46.633 --> 08:48.176
Adell, pull your men
off the road.

08:48.176 --> 08:50.261
We're going to expand
the crime scene.

08:53.890 --> 08:55.183
She crawled to here ...

08:55.808 --> 08:56.935
probably rested
for a moment ...

08:57.977 --> 08:59.729
losing a lot of blood...

09:02.732 --> 09:03.983
continued to travel...

09:07.654 --> 09:09.614
and somehow got up.

09:11.699 --> 09:13.159
Fell again right here.

09:23.169 --> 09:24.128
Wait a minute.

09:27.257 --> 09:28.675
Is that a shadow right there?

09:32.428 --> 09:34.180
That's definitely a car.

09:34.514 --> 09:35.932
Looks like a compact.

09:35.932 --> 09:37.392
Never turtled.

09:37.392 --> 09:38.518
The water's too shallow.

09:38.518 --> 09:40.937
So, she crawled from here
all the way to the road.

09:41.980 --> 09:44.190
A quarter of a mile
on her belly,

09:44.190 --> 09:46.943
with a nine-millimeter
round in her head.

09:46.943 --> 09:48.069
All for nothing.

09:48.778 --> 09:50.029
Not if we can help it.

10:12.657 --> 10:14.284
The window's
spider-webbed.

10:14.284 --> 10:16.411
Could have shattered
when Jane Doe got shot,

10:16.411 --> 10:17.912
just like Abby Sandoval.

10:17.912 --> 10:19.247
The difference is,

10:20.457 --> 10:22.375
Jane Doe had no
glass in her wound.

10:22.375 --> 10:23.668
I'll SPR the steering wheel,

10:23.668 --> 10:26.004
see if we can lift a
print give her a name.

10:26.004 --> 10:28.089
You know what?
Don't bother.

10:31.468 --> 10:32.886
I got her purse here.

10:33.928 --> 10:34.929
Any I.D.?

10:37.015 --> 10:38.141
Hang on.

10:41.603 --> 10:42.896
There's no driver's license,

10:42.896 --> 10:44.481
but here's a
check-cashing card.

10:44.481 --> 10:48.860
"Bonita Cruz,
Southwest Tenth Street."

10:48.860 --> 10:50.779
It's a couple of blocks
from my folks.

10:51.404 --> 10:53.656
Abby Sandoval lived in
the same neighborhood.

10:53.656 --> 10:56.451
She did. Southwest
14th street, right?

10:56.451 --> 10:57.786
Yeah, I know a lot
of girls like that.

10:57.786 --> 11:00.038
They come from Cuba,
Honduras,

11:00.038 --> 11:03.166
Nicaragua looking
for a better life.

11:03.166 --> 11:05.794
They wind up cleaning
toilets in Bal Harbour.

11:05.794 --> 11:07.962
It's the
"invisible ones."

11:08.380 --> 11:09.798
Perfect victims.

11:09.798 --> 11:11.257
No one gives them
a second look.

11:11.257 --> 11:13.760
Somebody gave this
one a second look.

11:13.760 --> 11:14.636
Whoop.

11:16.012 --> 11:18.098
Someone also
left us a present.

11:19.015 --> 11:20.183
Let's bag that.

11:26.106 --> 11:28.650
Eric, you used to play right
field for the 'canes, right?

11:28.650 --> 11:30.944
See how far you
can throw that.

11:36.700 --> 11:38.118
Nice throw.

11:39.160 --> 11:41.287
Okay, here's what
we need to do.

11:41.287 --> 11:44.249
Let's set a grid from the car
to where the rock landed.

11:44.541 --> 11:45.875
In case the guy
tossed the gun.

11:45.875 --> 11:48.586
Yup. Keep in touch.

11:55.301 --> 11:56.344
Duquesne.

11:57.303 --> 11:58.805
Detective Hagen.

11:59.305 --> 12:00.348
You got my results?

12:00.348 --> 12:02.392
Not since you
called me an hour ago.

12:02.392 --> 12:03.643
You told me you'd have
it done this morning.

12:03.643 --> 12:05.270
John, I have got
fifty-four rounds,

12:05.270 --> 12:07.772
and your being down here isn't
going to help me solve it any faster.

12:07.772 --> 12:08.815
I'm sorry.

12:08.815 --> 12:10.442
Am I bothering you
here in your nice,

12:10.442 --> 12:11.568
air-conditioned crime lab,

12:11.568 --> 12:13.153
'cause I'm sweating
my butt off...

12:13.153 --> 12:15.238
trying to get my causeway
shooter into arraignment.

12:15.947 --> 12:16.781
All right.

12:16.781 --> 12:18.241
Your personal hygiene aside,
I'm really sorry.

12:18.241 --> 12:19.909
Something came up,
and I got backed up.

12:19.909 --> 12:21.536
Something?
What kind of something?

12:21.536 --> 12:23.705
I can't tell you, but
I promise you as soon as

12:23.705 --> 12:26.416
I get this other thing off
my scope I will finish yours.

12:26.416 --> 12:27.917
Whatever it is better be big.

12:28.460 --> 12:29.794
It's the biggest.

12:31.254 --> 12:32.714
Big like Abby Sandoval?

12:33.548 --> 12:35.508
I heard about what happened
in court this morning.

12:36.343 --> 12:38.636
Word is Horatio
really stepped in it.

12:38.636 --> 12:39.888
We'll get your shooter.

12:39.888 --> 12:41.097
I just need you to
give me some time.

12:41.097 --> 12:42.849
I can't hold him
past noon.

12:42.849 --> 12:45.685
Cut him loose.
Rearrest him again tomorrow.

12:45.685 --> 12:46.644
What if he skips?

12:46.644 --> 12:48.313
Put a radio car on him.

12:48.313 --> 12:50.815
I don't know, John.
I have to do it.

12:52.359 --> 12:54.319
I hope Horatio knows
what he's doing.

12:57.322 --> 12:59.491
He's been doing
it a long time.

12:59.491 --> 13:01.576
Hope he gets
to keep doing it.

13:14.005 --> 13:15.799
Hey.
Hey.

13:16.424 --> 13:18.927
I found a whole bunch of
fibers on Bonita Cruz's dress.

13:18.927 --> 13:20.261
You get a match?
Yeah.

13:20.261 --> 13:22.847
Tropical weight
worsted wool.

13:22.847 --> 13:25.433
Same like the two we
pulled off of Abby Sandoval.

13:25.767 --> 13:26.893
I hate to say it,

13:26.893 --> 13:28.103
but I think we've got
the wrong guy in custody.

13:28.103 --> 13:30.980
Okay, but you just said you got
multiple fibers off Bonita's dress.

13:30.980 --> 13:31.898
Over fifty.

13:31.898 --> 13:34.025
You got two off Abby's.
That doesn't track.

13:34.025 --> 13:35.694
Neither does a
serial killer...

13:35.694 --> 13:38.071
who wears $2,000 suits
and kills maids.

13:40.156 --> 13:41.658
Unless he's not a serial.

13:41.991 --> 13:43.910
I think I figured out how
he picks his victims.

13:43.910 --> 13:44.786
Take a look at this.

13:44.786 --> 13:46.079
Did you get something
off the purse?

13:46.079 --> 13:47.122
Take a look.

13:52.168 --> 13:53.545
Looks like newsprint.

13:54.462 --> 13:56.339
The ink's way too
degraded to read.

13:56.339 --> 13:58.508
Okay, let's look deeper.

14:07.684 --> 14:09.144
Freeze-drying.

14:09.144 --> 14:11.896
It's a way to remove the water
without damaging the paper.

14:13.982 --> 14:15.025
Ready?

14:41.593 --> 14:43.762
Now try green
with an IR filter.

14:49.225 --> 14:51.561
"Empleos domesticos."

14:51.853 --> 14:53.730
These are ads
for housekeepers.

14:53.730 --> 14:54.981
From a cuban
newspaper.

14:54.981 --> 14:57.150
Diarios Las Americas.

14:58.193 --> 15:00.320
So, Bonita Cruz was
looking for a job.

15:00.862 --> 15:02.113
You want me to take this?

15:05.950 --> 15:07.994
Uh, no, I'll take it.

15:07.994 --> 15:09.371
You find Eric.

15:15.460 --> 15:17.170
Yelina.
Horatio.

15:17.170 --> 15:18.922
I heard about the
surfside triple.

15:18.922 --> 15:20.006
Nice going.

15:20.006 --> 15:21.591
Well, thank you.

15:21.591 --> 15:24.052
Just came to pick up
the final labs.

15:24.052 --> 15:25.595
Okay, let me walk you.

15:26.346 --> 15:27.347
Okay.

15:27.347 --> 15:28.807
Sorry about dinner.

15:28.807 --> 15:30.850
We've been
really backlogged.

15:30.850 --> 15:32.268
Yeah, I heard.

15:32.268 --> 15:35.355
Seems like a lot of cases are been
moved to the back burner lately.

15:35.355 --> 15:38.024
Call the city council and
send me more criminalists.

15:38.316 --> 15:40.610
Let's talk about
Abby Sandoval instead.

15:41.528 --> 15:42.862
What about her?

15:42.862 --> 15:44.406
Don't, okay?

15:45.448 --> 15:48.201
Word around the department
is you've reopened the case.

15:48.201 --> 15:49.828
Word travels fast.

15:49.828 --> 15:50.745
This is Miami.

15:50.745 --> 15:52.497
There are no secrets, Horatio.

15:53.540 --> 15:55.750
I have some concerns
about the case.

15:56.167 --> 15:57.043
Yeah.

15:57.043 --> 15:58.420
We've had this
conversation before.

15:58.420 --> 15:59.963
Well, then you
know how it ends.

16:00.714 --> 16:02.465
How long are we going to
keep dancing around in circles?

16:02.465 --> 16:03.299
I don't know.

16:03.299 --> 16:05.552
Someday we have to
talk about that, don't we?

16:06.594 --> 16:08.263
Yeah.
Someday.

16:10.348 --> 16:11.766
Just be careful, Horatio.

16:12.809 --> 16:16.062
If I did that, it would
take all the fun out of it.

16:17.731 --> 16:18.732
I'll call you.

16:27.157 --> 16:27.991
Any trouble?

16:28.742 --> 16:29.784
Hey.

16:30.243 --> 16:32.495
Editor gave the usual
first amendment defense.

16:32.495 --> 16:35.040
How'd you flip him?
I know the publisher.

16:35.040 --> 16:36.374
Any matches?

16:36.374 --> 16:37.959
Not yet,

16:37.959 --> 16:40.628
unless you're interested in
meeting a 300-pound transvestite.

16:40.628 --> 16:41.880
I'll pass.
Hang on a second.

16:41.880 --> 16:42.714
Horatio.

16:42.714 --> 16:43.465
Hey, it's Speed.

16:43.465 --> 16:45.342
We came up empty
on the canal.

16:45.342 --> 16:46.426
So, no gun?

16:46.426 --> 16:48.928
Actually, Delko
found three guns...

16:48.928 --> 16:51.681
and a washing machine,
but, uh, no nine mils.

16:51.681 --> 16:53.266
Any chance that he missed it?

16:53.266 --> 16:54.267
Let me ask him.

16:54.267 --> 16:56.144
Any chance you could
have missed it?

16:56.144 --> 16:57.937
It's pretty murky
down there.

16:57.937 --> 17:00.482
We did a hand-over
hand rigid-grid search...

17:00.482 --> 17:02.317
100 yards downstream.

17:02.734 --> 17:04.069
You get that?

17:06.154 --> 17:07.280
All right,
I'll tell him.

17:08.323 --> 17:09.366
What did he say?

17:10.200 --> 17:11.492
"Throw another rock."

17:12.202 --> 17:13.161
What does that mean?

17:13.161 --> 17:14.954
It means we got a long
night ahead of us.

18:51.634 --> 18:55.472
Okay, looks like Bonita Cruz circled
three ads for domestic work.

18:55.472 --> 18:56.806
Any stand out?

18:58.892 --> 19:00.310
Yeah, this one.

19:00.310 --> 19:02.896
600 bucks a week.
Rates have gone up.

19:03.521 --> 19:05.815
Okay, seems like a
good place to start.

19:06.858 --> 19:08.651
The number listed in
the ad doesn't answer,

19:08.651 --> 19:11.404
but the prefix strikes me as one
of those prepaid cell phones.

19:11.404 --> 19:13.490
Use it, toss it,
you can't trace it.

19:13.490 --> 19:16.618
Looks like that ad you're
looking for was a mail-in.

19:19.954 --> 19:22.207
Printed on your basic
laser jet, huh?

19:22.832 --> 19:24.626
Do you have the envelopes
these come in?

19:28.254 --> 19:29.547
We've got mail.

19:30.590 --> 19:32.217
There's no return address.

19:32.217 --> 19:34.511
But that's a postal
code right there.

19:51.861 --> 19:53.071
You guys,
we need to talk.

19:53.071 --> 19:56.074
Did you see this?
Did you see this?

19:56.700 --> 19:58.910
Councilwoman
Mercedes Escalante.

20:03.873 --> 20:06.251
You don't think she had
anything to do with it?

20:06.251 --> 20:07.335
I don't know.

20:07.961 --> 20:09.212
Let's find out.

20:16.092 --> 20:17.135
Good morning.

20:17.886 --> 20:18.970
Good morning.

20:20.013 --> 20:21.056
I'm Carl Galaz.

20:21.056 --> 20:23.183
I'm Special Assistant
to the Councilwoman.

20:23.183 --> 20:25.810
How can we assist
Miami's finest today?

20:25.810 --> 20:26.728
Here's what we need, Carl.

20:26.728 --> 20:30.357
I need to know who has
access to your office machines.

20:30.357 --> 20:31.733
Well, that's everyone
in this office.

20:31.733 --> 20:34.194
We have six staffers and
about a dozen interns.

20:34.819 --> 20:36.363
What's this about?
Two things.

20:36.363 --> 20:37.989
I'm going to need a list
of those names,

20:37.989 --> 20:40.867
and I'm going to need to
take the machines to my lab.

20:42.035 --> 20:43.119
Oh, afraid we can't do that.

20:43.119 --> 20:44.538
Not without our
lawyers present.

20:44.538 --> 20:46.081
You want to make
that call, please?

20:47.123 --> 20:48.708
Actually, it's my call.

20:49.459 --> 20:52.295
Lieutenant Caine.
Mercedes Escalante.

20:52.295 --> 20:54.381
I have followed your
career for many years.

20:54.381 --> 20:55.799
Likewise, Councilwoman.

20:55.799 --> 20:57.884
You will have our
full cooperation.

20:57.884 --> 20:59.135
The sooner we can
get to the truth,

20:59.135 --> 21:01.555
the sooner my husband
can come home to his family.

21:01.555 --> 21:03.682
Please take anything
you need...

21:03.682 --> 21:07.561
and we'll be happy to supply
you with a list of everyone...

21:07.561 --> 21:10.689
that has worked in the office
for the past twelve months. Carl?

21:22.534 --> 21:23.994
This is very generous of you.

21:23.994 --> 21:25.120
Oh, well,

21:25.120 --> 21:26.913
we're really looking forward to
putting all of this behind us,

21:26.913 --> 21:27.956
Lieutenant.

21:31.418 --> 21:34.921
Um ... would you
give us a second?

21:34.921 --> 21:36.006
Oh, absolutely.

21:36.840 --> 21:37.883
Thank you, Carl.

21:38.675 --> 21:39.718
Adelle.

21:43.096 --> 21:44.139
Be right there.

21:56.276 --> 21:58.195
The Councilwoman
knew we were coming.

22:01.114 --> 22:02.657
It's not what you think.

22:02.657 --> 22:04.034
What do I think?

22:04.659 --> 22:06.244
I know Mercedes,

22:06.244 --> 22:09.706
since we were kids at San Juan
Bosco but she runs the community...

22:09.706 --> 22:12.626
and when I need information,
she gives it to me.

22:12.626 --> 22:14.044
One hand washes the other.

22:14.044 --> 22:15.420
Together they wash the face.

22:15.420 --> 22:16.421
Come on, H.,

22:16.421 --> 22:18.882
You know that's the way things
get done here in Miami.

22:18.882 --> 22:20.008
I understand that, Adell.

22:20.008 --> 22:23.094
H., It was a courtesy heads-up,
nothing more.

22:23.094 --> 22:25.889
Nothing more than I would have
done in any other knock-and-talk.

22:26.932 --> 22:27.974
Okay.

22:27.974 --> 22:30.894
Let's not give her any
more help, all right?

22:31.311 --> 22:32.354
Okay.

22:37.442 --> 22:39.194
Hey, where's that pistol?

22:39.194 --> 22:41.196
Uh, I checked it into
evidence a couple hours ago.

22:41.196 --> 22:41.988
What are you talking about?

22:41.988 --> 22:43.240
You mean it's just
been sitting there?

22:43.240 --> 22:45.909
Yeah, I paged you and
you never answered.

22:45.909 --> 22:48.161
I turned my pager off
when I was on the range.

22:48.161 --> 22:49.287
I tried to get in
touch with you.

22:49.287 --> 22:51.706
I've been chained at the lab
with a 54-round shooting ...

22:51.706 --> 22:53.959
that was supposed to be
processed twelve hours ago.

22:53.959 --> 22:55.919
Yeah, well I spent
the same twelve hours ...

22:55.919 --> 22:58.129
inhaling sewage at the
bottom of the Tamiami Canal,

22:58.129 --> 23:00.006
so everyone's
got a sad story.

23:01.466 --> 23:02.676
I'm sorry.

23:03.093 --> 23:04.135
Me, too.

23:04.970 --> 23:06.012
Okay.

23:10.600 --> 23:12.102
We're due in court
in two hours,

23:12.102 --> 23:14.396
is there any way
to link these two?

23:14.396 --> 23:15.730
Not with the
bullets alone.

23:15.730 --> 23:17.983
The rifling on Abby's
bullet is good,

23:17.983 --> 23:19.025
but Bonita's is damaged.

23:19.025 --> 23:21.361
But there's no way to match
this to Abby or the gun,

23:21.361 --> 23:23.196
but there might be
another way.

23:23.196 --> 23:24.990
Cartridge casing we
found in Bonita's car.

23:24.990 --> 23:26.408
Exactly.

23:26.408 --> 23:28.618
So if I can get a
test-fire on the pistol,

23:28.618 --> 23:30.704
then I get match the rifling...

23:30.704 --> 23:34.875
on Abby's bullet to the firing-pin
impression of Bonita's casing.

23:35.876 --> 23:37.377
The gun is the key.

23:37.377 --> 23:39.713
Without it we've got nothing.
We've got to get it.

23:40.547 --> 23:42.007
The clock is ticking.

23:45.844 --> 23:47.053
Misfire.

23:50.182 --> 23:52.392
Okay, we've
got a problem.

23:53.018 --> 23:54.561
Can't get a test-fire.

23:54.561 --> 23:55.979
Not with this weapon ...

23:55.979 --> 23:58.064
and not in the amount
of time we have left.

23:58.690 --> 24:00.066
What's your Plan B?

24:01.109 --> 24:02.152
Gun vault.

24:07.240 --> 24:09.326
Be still my heart.

25:05.048 --> 25:06.424
Hey.
How'd we do?

25:06.424 --> 25:08.969
I did a mix and match from the
vault and finally got a test-fire.

25:08.969 --> 25:09.761
Bottom line?

25:09.761 --> 25:12.556
Bonita Cruz and Abby Sandoval
were killed by the same weapon.

25:12.556 --> 25:14.057
We got a match.
We got a match.

25:14.057 --> 25:15.725
Excellent.
Nice going.

25:16.142 --> 25:17.269
Thank you.

25:20.730 --> 25:24.192
Based on what I was just given,
this is pretty much a bombshell, so ...

25:24.192 --> 25:26.695
I'm going to rule on it now.
Please step back.

25:31.950 --> 25:33.410
It has come to
my attention...

25:33.410 --> 25:35.704
that the crime lab has uncovered
new evidence in this case.

25:36.037 --> 25:38.832
Evidence of an exculpatory
nature to the defendant.

25:39.749 --> 25:42.752
As such, defense counsel
has moved for a mistrial.

25:42.752 --> 25:45.046
So granted.
This court is adjourned.

25:48.967 --> 25:50.010
Horatio,

25:51.344 --> 25:54.472
I'm not going to take the fall with
you on this one, I warned you.

25:54.472 --> 25:55.765
It's not an acquittal.
It's a mistrial.

25:55.765 --> 25:56.808
You can re-file.

25:56.808 --> 25:59.561
You got the extra million
bucks for the new trial?

25:59.561 --> 26:01.646
I'm about to bring you
two defendants.

26:01.646 --> 26:03.106
Yeah, you do that.

26:15.160 --> 26:17.996
In a stunning setback for
the Miami-Dade Crime Lab,

26:17.996 --> 26:19.873
and the State
Attorney's office,

26:19.873 --> 26:23.668
Real Estate Developer Lorenzo
Escalante was released today ...

26:23.668 --> 26:26.796
after a mistrial was declared
in the Abby Sandoval ...

26:26.796 --> 26:29.090
I can't believe we're
letting this jackass walk.

26:30.008 --> 26:31.760
I hope H knows
what he's doing.

26:31.760 --> 26:34.513
You know what they say,
no guts, no glory.

26:34.513 --> 26:36.431
What else could we do if
you want to catch the killer?

26:36.431 --> 26:37.641
Yeah, killers.

26:37.641 --> 26:39.184
Okay, well,
say there's two killers.

26:39.184 --> 26:40.977
How do you explain
the same fibers,

26:40.977 --> 26:43.355
the same murder weapon,
same taste for mojitos?

26:43.355 --> 26:44.856
Apples and oranges.

26:44.856 --> 26:48.527
We got two fibers you find on Abby,
but over fifty on Bonita.

26:48.527 --> 26:51.821
Abby's killer keeps the gun,
Bonita's tosses it in the canal.

26:51.821 --> 26:54.407
Okay, how did the second killer
get their hands on the gun...

26:54.407 --> 26:55.450
from the first murder?

26:55.742 --> 26:57.994
You talking about the
apple or the orange?

26:57.994 --> 26:59.246
Oh, dear god,
I'm hungry.

27:00.205 --> 27:02.332
I'm just saying there's
two killers out there.

27:02.749 --> 27:05.502
Okay, and the second
killer couldn't possibly ...

27:05.502 --> 27:06.878
have all the details
from the first murder.

27:06.878 --> 27:07.963
Maybe he did.

27:08.713 --> 27:11.550
Maybe he did have the details
and that would make him...

27:11.550 --> 27:12.968
a copycat, wouldn't it?

27:15.470 --> 27:16.638
Ready?

27:17.681 --> 27:19.891
So I'm a copycat...

27:19.891 --> 27:23.228
and I want to make Bonita Cruz
look like my second victim.

27:23.687 --> 27:25.272
I've selected Bonita...

27:25.272 --> 27:28.984
because she is almost
identical to Abby Sandoval.

27:28.984 --> 27:32.487
So you place a want ad for
a young Latina housekeeper.

27:32.487 --> 27:33.738
You offer top salary.

27:33.738 --> 27:36.533
You buy a disposable cell
phone so you can't be traced.

27:39.077 --> 27:41.037
And like Abby,
she has to be pretty,

27:41.037 --> 27:42.164
so you meet her in person,

27:42.164 --> 27:44.166
someplace public so
she doesn't get spooked.

27:44.166 --> 27:45.917
And when you
meet Bonita Cruz,

27:45.917 --> 27:47.460
you know you
have your victim.

27:49.212 --> 27:50.922
Right, so you hire Bonita.

27:51.339 --> 27:52.465
You follow her.

27:52.465 --> 27:55.468
You pull her over,
and then you shoot her.

27:55.468 --> 27:58.013
With the gun you've procured
from your first murder.

27:58.013 --> 27:59.389
Then you plant the fibers.

27:59.389 --> 28:01.224
Push the car
into the canal.

28:01.224 --> 28:02.976
And throw the gun
in for us to find.

28:02.976 --> 28:04.436
Let's prove that.

28:04.769 --> 28:05.896
Alexx ...

28:06.188 --> 28:08.398
how tall was Bonita Cruz?

28:08.398 --> 28:10.066
About five six.

28:10.483 --> 28:11.776
And her wound track?

28:11.776 --> 28:15.488
Left to right, angle is downward
an inch below the hairline.

28:15.488 --> 28:16.531
Show me.

28:27.125 --> 28:28.126
They don't line up.

28:28.126 --> 28:29.252
Here's why.

28:29.252 --> 28:32.506
The shot that killed Bonita Cruz
did not go through this window.

28:33.340 --> 28:34.382
Bang to the temple.

28:35.467 --> 28:36.760
Bang through
the window.

28:37.802 --> 28:39.971
There were two shots.
There were two shots.

28:46.394 --> 28:47.771
Another nine mil.

28:47.771 --> 28:48.813
There you have it.

28:53.735 --> 28:56.238
That means the killer copied
everything down to the...

28:56.238 --> 28:58.865
smallest detail including shooting
out the driver-side window.

28:58.865 --> 29:02.118
You can't plan detail
because events are random.

29:02.118 --> 29:04.079
They can never be
perfectly recreated.

29:04.079 --> 29:06.915
One thing he didn't count on was
her rolling down the window.

29:13.171 --> 29:15.841
We know of two people
that directly benefit ...

29:15.841 --> 29:17.926
from the existence
of Bonita Cruz, right?

29:17.926 --> 29:19.469
Lorenzo Escalante.

29:19.469 --> 29:22.681
Guy has motive,
he's got connections,

29:22.681 --> 29:23.723
so he hires a guy.

29:23.723 --> 29:25.684
Well, it doesn't
have to be a guy.

29:25.684 --> 29:28.186
Women commit 17%
of all homicides...

29:28.186 --> 29:29.729
and being connected
to a murder conviction ...

29:29.729 --> 29:31.273
could ruin
your political career.

29:31.273 --> 29:32.983
You're still thinking
it's the wife?

29:33.400 --> 29:34.776
It seems out of character.

29:34.776 --> 29:37.195
What I hear, she used to run
with a pretty rough crowd.

29:37.195 --> 29:38.697
She campaigned on it,

29:38.697 --> 29:41.324
but we still have to put
her outside this car.

29:42.701 --> 29:43.994
Horatio.

29:45.036 --> 29:46.955
I have someone
you should meet.

29:46.955 --> 29:50.208
She claims she's more
comfortable in Spanish.

29:50.542 --> 29:52.085
This is Carmen Abregon.

29:52.085 --> 29:53.295
She's one of those...

29:53.295 --> 29:55.797
43 women we tracked
down via cell phone records.

29:55.797 --> 29:58.008
She responded to
that ad in the Diario.

29:58.008 --> 29:58.800
Okay.

30:17.777 --> 30:18.820
El homble?

30:18.820 --> 30:19.613
Si.

30:36.129 --> 30:38.173
Bad feeling?
Por que?

30:41.968 --> 30:44.763
Con este calor,
con este clima en Miami.

30:54.064 --> 30:56.191
Mojitos.
Mojitos.

30:57.150 --> 31:00.278
Carmen, do you remember
what the man looked like?

31:13.750 --> 31:14.793
Hey, what's up?

31:14.793 --> 31:16.878
You still got that list
Galaz gave us?

31:16.878 --> 31:18.296
Yeah, it's ...

31:18.839 --> 31:21.132
... right here.
I think I've got an idea.

31:22.092 --> 31:22.968
I think I've got an idea.

31:22.968 --> 31:24.636
Speed, see what else
you can do with this.

31:24.636 --> 31:25.804
Will do.

31:25.804 --> 31:27.055
It's just a list.

31:27.055 --> 31:29.432
Actually, it may be much more.

31:31.226 --> 31:35.021
Writing on a notepad leaves
indentations on the pages beneath.

31:35.730 --> 31:38.108
We should be able to see
what was written...

31:38.108 --> 31:40.193
up to seven
layers above.

31:44.823 --> 31:45.699
Crespo.

31:47.492 --> 31:48.660
El nariz no tán polea.

31:49.578 --> 31:52.289
Un poco de masa.
Pero mas escuro.

31:53.498 --> 31:54.875
Ojos negros.
No tán poleo.

32:32.662 --> 32:34.039
See anybody you know?

32:38.418 --> 32:41.046
Carl Galaz.
Escalante's handler.

32:41.671 --> 32:44.799
Let's see how
Carl handles this.

32:51.138 --> 32:54.725
Carl Galaz, you're under arrest
for the murder of Bonita Cruz.

32:56.893 --> 32:58.395
You know what you just did?

32:59.438 --> 33:00.897
Your career is over.

33:01.606 --> 33:02.357
When I'm through with you,

33:02.357 --> 33:05.485
you're going to be doing
time cards at county lockup.

33:09.281 --> 33:11.575
Still got the phone, Carl.

33:13.660 --> 33:15.329
You still have
the phone.

33:20.917 --> 33:23.295
You've got seven dollars
of call time left, Carl.

33:23.295 --> 33:26.298
Seven dollars in exchange
for the rest of your life.

33:26.298 --> 33:27.341
Take him.

33:37.100 --> 33:39.853
Carl, I think I understand
what's going on here.

33:39.853 --> 33:43.023
You killed Bonita Cruz to get
Lorenzo off the hook for murder.

33:43.023 --> 33:44.149
I understand that part.

33:44.149 --> 33:47.402
What I'm curious about
is whose gun was it?

33:47.402 --> 33:48.236
It was my gun.

33:48.236 --> 33:50.155
I have advised my client
not to speak further.

33:50.155 --> 33:51.740
I want that on the record.

33:51.740 --> 33:53.450
Counselor,
I'll get you a copy.

33:53.450 --> 33:54.284
How would that be?

33:54.284 --> 33:57.788
Carl, you are about
to take the fall.

33:57.788 --> 33:59.790
Now, is that what this is?

34:00.832 --> 34:01.958
I killed them.

34:02.501 --> 34:03.460
I killed them both.

34:03.460 --> 34:06.588
Why, Carl, are you
protecting the Escalantes?

34:06.588 --> 34:10.300
The Escalantes gave me
their trust and their friendship.

34:10.300 --> 34:12.386
They gave me respect.

34:13.637 --> 34:14.929
Now I owe
them everything.

34:14.929 --> 34:16.556
This is your last chance.

34:16.556 --> 34:19.685
You can either ride their
coattails or you can ride mine.

34:19.685 --> 34:20.936
You decide.

34:25.232 --> 34:27.192
Carl ...

34:29.277 --> 34:30.320
I killed them.

34:31.154 --> 34:32.656
All right.

34:35.784 --> 34:37.159
Lieutenant ...

34:37.159 --> 34:38.245
Lieutenant Caine.

34:39.788 --> 34:41.373
I just wanted to
thank you ...

34:42.290 --> 34:44.751
for all your hard work
on behalf of the city.

34:45.710 --> 34:47.212
You can't imagine how...

34:47.212 --> 34:50.047
shocked we all
are to learn about Carl.

34:50.841 --> 34:51.591
Councilwoman,

34:51.591 --> 34:54.219
I'm certain this has been a
very difficult period for you.

34:54.219 --> 34:55.554
I also wanted to
thank you as a ...

34:55.554 --> 34:59.016
as a wife --
for clearing my husband.

34:59.850 --> 35:02.936
If there's anything I can
ever do for you,

35:02.936 --> 35:05.230
for your aspirations ...

35:10.360 --> 35:11.695
Right now, councilwoman,

35:11.695 --> 35:14.990
my only aspiration is to find
out who killed these women.

35:15.699 --> 35:17.492
So don't thank me yet.

35:18.452 --> 35:19.703
I'm not done.

35:27.252 --> 35:29.421
How we doing on
the employee list?

35:29.421 --> 35:32.132
It matches the handwriting
sample from Carl Galaz.

35:32.132 --> 35:34.134
It was pretty messy
and overlapping,

35:34.134 --> 35:35.927
but I measured the
stroke depth and ...

35:35.927 --> 35:37.012
I managed
to isolate the layers.

35:37.012 --> 35:39.848
There were seven pages in all,
dating back week by week.

35:40.140 --> 35:43.268
We get to the fifth week,
he writes a to-do list.

35:43.602 --> 35:47.689
"Buy gloves, clean gun,
disposable cell phone."

35:47.689 --> 35:48.774
To-do list.

35:48.774 --> 35:50.275
He's not the first to do that,

35:50.275 --> 35:53.737
but it doesn't confirm who
killed Abby Sandoval, does it?

35:54.029 --> 35:56.698
No, but that's why I went
back to the second week,

35:56.698 --> 35:59.284
and "barbecue."

35:59.284 --> 36:00.577
I'm thinking that's
not a lunch order.

36:00.577 --> 36:02.079
And it's not Galaz's
handwriting.

36:02.079 --> 36:04.331
No, it's not.
But guess whose it is.

36:06.124 --> 36:08.126
I got this from
public records.

36:08.126 --> 36:10.003
A city lease drafted by ...

36:10.003 --> 36:11.421
Lorenzo Escalante.

36:11.421 --> 36:12.798
Lorenzo ...

36:12.798 --> 36:14.883
you're about
to lose your lease.

36:18.345 --> 36:21.181
John! I got the results for
your causeway shooter.

36:21.181 --> 36:23.225
It matches across the aboard.
He's going away.

36:23.225 --> 36:24.768
You got that right.

36:24.768 --> 36:26.436
Patrol picked him up already.

36:26.436 --> 36:28.855
I thought you needed
ballistics to file on him.

36:28.855 --> 36:30.774
We got ballistics.

36:30.774 --> 36:33.193
He shot someone else
after we cut him loose.

36:33.610 --> 36:34.945
I thought you were
going to watch him.

36:34.945 --> 36:36.071
We did.

36:36.071 --> 36:37.989
He got into a beef with
a street-level dealer;

36:37.989 --> 36:39.116
grabbed his gun ...

36:39.116 --> 36:41.410
and put two rounds in him before
our guys could get out of the car.

36:43.161 --> 36:44.663
God, I am so sorry.

36:45.580 --> 36:48.583
Hey, one lowlife
pops another.

36:48.583 --> 36:50.043
The streets are safer for it.

36:50.377 --> 36:53.213
Just be glad it wasn't a taxpayer,
for you and Horatio's sake.

36:53.213 --> 36:54.756
Oh, no, that release
was my call.

36:54.756 --> 36:56.466
He didn't have anything
to do with it.

36:57.509 --> 37:00.303
Listen, I know you
look up to the guy ...

37:01.346 --> 37:02.472
Sure, I do.

37:02.472 --> 37:04.599
I'm just saying,

37:04.599 --> 37:06.476
it's a hell of a lonely
road he's walking.

37:06.476 --> 37:08.270
Well, that's why
I'm walking it with him.

37:17.779 --> 37:19.406
I don't know what we
think we're going to find.

37:19.406 --> 37:21.742
We went over the Escalante
place about eight months ago.

37:21.742 --> 37:23.910
Canine units,
metal detectors -- the works.

37:23.910 --> 37:25.287
Now, there's nothing inside.

37:25.287 --> 37:26.663
No hidden safes inside,

37:26.663 --> 37:29.041
and there's nothing
buried in this backyard.

37:29.541 --> 37:30.876
Did you check
the barbecue?

37:32.961 --> 37:34.963
Seven across ...

37:36.006 --> 37:37.049
three down.

37:56.318 --> 37:57.611
Golden talon ...

37:58.653 --> 38:01.156
just like the one we
took out of Abby Sandoval.

38:17.047 --> 38:18.548
Yes! Yes! Yes!

38:18.548 --> 38:20.092
Lock that elbow,
Lorenzo.

38:23.220 --> 38:25.263
Well, we'll have to talk to
the membership committee.

38:25.972 --> 38:28.058
They're letting anyone
in these days.

38:28.058 --> 38:29.810
Speaking of which ...

38:30.852 --> 38:32.688
tell him what he's won, Adelle.

38:32.688 --> 38:34.189
It's a new kind of membership:

38:34.189 --> 38:37.275
Gated estate, private room,
high security.

38:37.275 --> 38:39.611
And here's the best part:

38:39.611 --> 38:40.904
It's for life.

38:42.989 --> 38:44.491
Mercedes ...

38:44.491 --> 38:47.452
Call the lawyer.
This is harassment.

38:48.495 --> 38:49.621
Take him.

38:49.621 --> 38:50.998
You can't do this.

38:54.126 --> 38:55.961
You can't do this.
Mercedes ...

38:57.713 --> 38:58.797
Mercedes.

39:00.549 --> 39:01.299
Mercedes ...

39:01.299 --> 39:03.468
Que pasas chica.

39:03.468 --> 39:06.805
Mercedes!
Mercedes!

39:06.805 --> 39:09.641
Ayuda-me.
I'll have your jobs for this.

39:14.604 --> 39:15.772
You want to take a walk?

39:20.694 --> 39:22.654
So what does Carl get?
A pardon in four years,

39:22.654 --> 39:25.907
after you take residency in the
governor's mansion in Tallahassee?

39:25.907 --> 39:28.702
Be very careful,
Lieutenant Caine.

39:28.994 --> 39:31.371
False accusations
can ruin a career.

39:31.371 --> 39:33.790
I'd hate for that
career to be yours.

39:35.250 --> 39:36.209
Councilwoman ...

39:38.086 --> 39:43.091
that is a blade that
cuts both ways.

39:45.927 --> 39:48.013
Councilwoman ...
care to comment,

39:48.013 --> 39:49.139
Mrs. Escalante?

39:49.139 --> 39:51.099
Mrs. Escalante, how do
you respond to this?

39:51.099 --> 39:53.185
Your public awaits you.

39:56.355 --> 39:57.814
Councilwoman Escalante,
do you think he did it?

39:57.814 --> 40:00.150
How will this affect
your reelection campaign?

40:00.150 --> 40:02.277
Councilwoman, do you
have any comment?

40:03.945 --> 40:05.322
This is a tragedy.

40:05.614 --> 40:07.658
It has affected
my family deeply.

40:08.575 --> 40:10.494
I will persevere ...

40:10.494 --> 40:12.454
as I always have.

40:12.454 --> 40:13.622
Knowing that,

40:13.622 --> 40:16.750
my first responsibility is to the
good people of this community.

40:26.551 --> 40:28.387
Hi.
Hi.

40:28.387 --> 40:29.429
Are you ...

40:30.055 --> 40:32.391
hungry for some
ropa vieja?

40:32.683 --> 40:33.767
I already ate.

40:34.393 --> 40:35.435
How about dessert?

40:35.852 --> 40:37.062
Finished that too.

40:40.065 --> 40:41.441
You should've called.

40:42.401 --> 40:43.443
You're right.

40:49.700 --> 40:50.951
I have, uh ...

40:52.285 --> 40:54.329
I've been thinking
about Raymond.

40:57.457 --> 40:59.543
I think about
him every day.

41:02.671 --> 41:04.172
I don't want to go there.

41:05.424 --> 41:06.967
Too complicated.

41:09.052 --> 41:11.763
What if I were to say that you
wouldn't have to go there alone?

41:16.601 --> 41:18.437
Do you understand
what you're saying?

41:18.437 --> 41:19.438
I do.

41:23.108 --> 41:24.568
I haven't had coffee yet.
