-(sighs happily)

-(indistinct chatter)
-Well...

02:14.750 --> 02:18.166
Guess I'm gonna take off,

-(plays sad note)

02:21.417 --> 02:25.542
No offense, but that was
the most shoob-tacular Ninja exit ever.

02:25.625 --> 02:29.333

How could I be out of smoke bombs?

02:42.250 --> 02:45.083
Wow. You know,
I waste a lot of smoke bombs.

02:45.166 --> 02:48.250
So go to the NinjaNomistore
and order more.

02:48.333 --> 02:51.000
-Can I even do that?

Come on! Smoke bombs not for show?
Have you seen how Bruce I look?

03:05.166 --> 03:08.417
I'm all, "Smoke bomb."
Then I'm like, "Kaboosh!"

03:08.500 --> 03:11.333
(gasps, screams) Ow.

03:11.417 --> 03:14.208
(panting) Okay, smoke bombs
are for strategy.

03:14.291 --> 03:15.834
Just tell me how to restock.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.291
Whoa.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Ha!

03:24.625 --> 03:27.000
(Randy) "Only from the
sacred sap of the skunk pine

03:27.083 --> 03:28.875

03:37.959 --> 03:39.417
Little change of plans for tonight.

03:39.500 --> 03:41.166
Before we get our movie marathon on,

03:41.250 --> 03:42.667
we've got to take a trip to the forest.

03:42.750 --> 03:43.834
-There's this tree.
-But...

03:43.917 --> 03:46.083
I know, you hate nature,

03:46.166 --> 03:48.333
but the sap is the
only way to make smoke bombs.

03:48.417 --> 03:49.583
-(grumbles)
-Don't worry.

03:49.667 --> 03:51.333
We have 12 more days
of winter break.

03:51.417 --> 03:54.083
-(deep voice) Winter break!
-I said I can't hang out tonight.

03:54.166 --> 03:57.417
I have a previous engagement?

03:57.500 --> 04:01.166
(laughs) "Previous engagement."
That's hilarious!

04:01.250 --> 04:04.500
Wait, are you serious?
What... What you up to?

04:04.583 --> 04:07.583
Nothing! It's just, uh, a family thing?

04:08.500 --> 04:09.875
Oh, okay, yeah.

04:10.542 --> 04:13.875
Uh, I guess I'll, um,
I'll see you tomorrow.

04:14.583 --> 04:16.625
Uh, yes! Tomorrow.

04:17.750 --> 04:19.667
-(sighs heavily)
-(moans)

04:19.750 --> 04:21.583
-Call me!
-Mmm...

04:23.917 --> 04:24.834
(grunts)

04:24.917 --> 04:25.834
Hiyah!

04:26.667 --> 04:28.083
Hiyah, hiyah! (grunts)

04:28.166 --> 04:30.083
-Hiyah, hiyah! (groans)

04:36.083 --> 04:38.041
Hello, skunk pie.

04:38.125 --> 04:41.917
Oh, it's awful!
But sacred, sacredly awful.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.291
Ninja sap tap! Huh?

04:45.083 --> 04:46.625
What the juice?

04:47.583 --> 04:50.291
McFist, you just snaked
my smoke bomb tree!

04:50.375 --> 04:52.000
(shouting)

04:54.083 --> 04:54.917

04:59.375 --> 05:02.709
("Deck the Halls" playing)

05:02.792 --> 05:06.291
Eh! Doesn't smell very festive.

05:06.375 --> 05:09.834
Oh, Hannibal, you got me
the biggest tree in the forest!

05:09.917 --> 05:12.250
Just like you asked, sugarplums.

05:12.333 --> 05:15.542
Merry McChristmas
faceless drones of my McEmpire.

05:15.625 --> 05:17.375
Enjoy the free eats!

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
(choir) Aah!

05:21.083 --> 05:23.041
McFist killed a 800-year-old

05:23.125 --> 05:25.041
sacred Ninja tree
for his holiday party?

05:25.125 --> 05:26.375
I did not see that coming.

05:26.458 --> 05:27.375
(grunts)

05:27.458 --> 05:30.458
No way McFist is dumb enough
to leave these things...

05:31.000 --> 05:31.917
...unlocked!

05:32.000 --> 05:35.083
Oh, McFist, you need to
Ninja-proof your house.

05:41.583 --> 05:42.917
Hmm?

05:43.917 --> 05:45.125

-(indistinct chattering)

05:49.875 --> 05:52.041
Oh, this is such a
super party, Hannibal.

05:52.125 --> 05:55.625
I've been mingling so much
my smile muscles are starting to cramp.

05:55.709 --> 05:57.625
-(Hannibal) Mmm!
-Although I still think

05:57.709 --> 05:59.917
-we should've gotten a DJ.
-(growls)

06:00.000 --> 06:03.667
Do you know how hard it was
to book Doc Matrix and the Inkjet quartet?

06:03.750 --> 06:06.917
-(music continues)
-Hmm?

06:07.000 --> 06:08.875
-Shrimp-ba-ba-ru-ba!
-Howard?

06:08.959 --> 06:10.792
What the juice are you doing here?

06:10.875 --> 06:12.458
Oh, Cunningham!

06:12.542 --> 06:18.500
Hey! Great to see you at this party
which I am also attending.

06:18.583 --> 06:20.291
You said you had a family thing.

06:20.375 --> 06:21.750
It is a family thing!

06:22.417 --> 06:24.959
(sighs) My dad's company was
bought out by McFist's company.

06:25.041 --> 06:28.166
We're a McFist family now. Yay...

06:28.250 --> 06:31.709
(gasps) What? Your dad
works for my arch-nemesis?

06:31.792 --> 06:32.792
Why didn't you tell me?

06:32.875 --> 06:36.000
Because I knew you'd
be all "(gasps) What?"

06:36.083 --> 06:37.417
It's really not such a big deal.

06:37.500 --> 06:39.333
Being lied to by your best friend?

06:39.417 --> 06:41.375
-That's the biggest deal.
-(grunts)

06:41.458 --> 06:43.542
-Hmm?
-So the Ninja is back.

06:43.625 --> 06:45.125
The Ninja? Hm.

06:45.208 --> 06:47.542
-Attention, everyone!
-(gasps)

06:48.875 --> 06:52.875
Our security system
has detected an intruder.

06:52.959 --> 06:55.166
-(all exclaim)
-I bet it's that guy.

06:56.583 --> 06:59.417
No, you shoob, he means me!

06:59.500 --> 07:02.208
Please display your
McFist bands for the robo-elves,

07:02.291 --> 07:05.333
so we can find the uninvited guest
and eliminate him!

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
-(whispering indistinctly)
-Eh, nicely. (groans)

07:09.083 --> 07:11.792
Show me your McFist
band or be destroyed.

07:11.875 --> 07:13.208
Merry Christmas!

07:15.000 --> 07:17.375
-(gasps)
-I'll give you mine.

07:17.458 --> 07:19.458
That'll totally make up
for me lying to you.

07:19.542 --> 07:21.542
-It totally won't.
-(grunts)

07:21.625 --> 07:23.709
-I gotta get to that tree.
-It's getting looser.

07:23.792 --> 07:26.291
No, tighter!
It's getting tighter. (yells)

07:26.875 --> 07:29.208
Fist band.
Show me your McFist band.

07:29.291 --> 07:30.458
Merry Christmas.

07:30.542 --> 07:32.041
...your McFist band.

07:32.125 --> 07:34.417
Show me your McFist band.

07:37.083 --> 07:40.500
Ah... (grunting)

07:40.583 --> 07:41.417
Huh?

07:46.542 --> 07:49.792
-Show me your McFist band.
-Ah, I'm totally shoobed.

07:51.208 --> 07:53.458
"The Ninja smoke bomb
is a tool of strategy,

07:53.542 --> 07:57.083

Show? Strategy?

07:57.166 --> 07:59.750
What if, sometimes,
the show is the strategy?

07:59.834 --> 08:01.208
(bells ring)

08:01.959 --> 08:04.166
Merry Christmas, everybody!

08:04.250 --> 08:05.709
-All right!
-(chattering)

08:05.792 --> 08:08.000
Whoa. He just came out of that chimney!

08:08.083 --> 08:10.834
The Ninja is Santa Claus?
You're a fake!

08:10.917 --> 08:14.875
-My, what a glorious tree.
-Yeah. She's a real beaut.

08:14.959 --> 08:17.375
So, what are you doing here, Ninja?

08:17.458 --> 08:21.417
Oh, I just stopped by to see Norrisville's
most beloved gazillionaire.

08:21.500 --> 08:24.041
But, while I'm here, Ninja sap attack!

08:25.875 --> 08:29.917
Not sure why you're doing that,
but I am not going to let it happen.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.458
Really? In front of all these people.

08:32.542 --> 08:34.625
-(indistinct chattering)
-(grumbling)

08:34.709 --> 08:40.542
Merry Christmas, McFist.
And to all a good Ninja!

08:42.333 --> 08:44.083
I can't believe that worked.

08:44.166 --> 08:45.583
Oh... boy.

08:47.166 --> 08:49.500
Almost worked. It almost worked.

08:49.583 --> 08:52.917
In the spirit of the holidays,
any chance we can just skip this fight?

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
-(growls)
-(screams) So that's a "no."

08:57.083 --> 08:59.834
-Get him.
-(growling)

08:59.917 --> 09:00.834
Ninja dodge!

09:00.917 --> 09:03.166
On Dasher, on Donner,

09:03.250 --> 09:05.667
on Dancer, on Blitzen.

09:06.375 --> 09:08.250
And a snowball slash.

09:08.333 --> 09:10.750
Hiyah! Hiyah! Hiyah! Hiyah!
(continues)

09:12.500 --> 09:13.750
Mmm.

09:14.542 --> 09:16.917
-Oh-uh. (yells, grunts)
-(shouts)

09:20.208 --> 09:22.792
-My sap!
-Destroy the Ninja.

09:22.875 --> 09:25.792
-Destroy the Ninja! Yes!
-(all gasp)

09:25.875 --> 09:29.875
I mean, no! Wow! Oh, the robots,
they have gone crazy!

09:29.959 --> 09:33.792
(screams) Everyone, please exit
the room in an orderly fashion.

09:33.875 --> 09:36.959
-(garbling)
-(all scream)

09:37.041 --> 09:38.291
(grunts)

09:40.709 --> 09:41.625
Oh, boy.

09:42.625 --> 09:44.083
-(thudding)
-(yells)

09:44.166 --> 09:45.500
Give that snowman a raise.

09:45.583 --> 09:46.875
(shouts)

09:46.959 --> 09:49.333
-I got my wristband off!
-A little late, buddy.

09:49.417 --> 09:50.792
If only I had a smoke bomb.

09:50.875 --> 09:52.625
Didn't you find your smoke bomb tree?

09:52.709 --> 09:54.417
Howard, that is the smoke bomb tree.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.000
Wait a minute. The smoke bomb tree!

09:56.083 --> 09:58.125
You're a genius!
Although I'm still mad at you.

09:58.208 --> 10:00.333
-(grunts)
-(groans)

10:00.417 --> 10:02.750
-(grunts)
-If you let him escape

10:02.834 --> 10:04.125
Christmas is cancelled!

10:05.625 --> 10:07.125
Huh? Ah!

10:08.125 --> 10:09.709
(Randy shouting)

10:09.792 --> 10:13.125
-Whoa!
-Yah!

10:14.291 --> 10:16.208
I've been waiting all night to say this.

10:16.834 --> 10:18.375
Smoke bomb!

10:19.000 --> 10:21.375
(Hannibal) I can't see a thing.
Did we get him?

10:23.125 --> 10:25.542
(all exclaim)

10:25.625 --> 10:28.792
-It smells like...
-The smoke bomb tree. It's gone.

10:28.875 --> 10:31.250
Listen, I'm sorry I lied to you.

10:31.333 --> 10:34.959
But what if I got you
a present that made everything all better?

10:35.041 --> 10:38.792
There's no thing you could get me
that would possibly make up for...

10:38.875 --> 10:40.250
Except that.

10:42.583 --> 10:44.792
Now I hit it with some art of heal.

10:47.041 --> 10:50.750
Couple days I be
dripping in smoke bombs.

10:50.834 --> 10:53.208
-Thanks, Howard.
-Merry Christmas, Cunningham.

10:53.291 --> 10:55.500
I did not think this is how we'd be

10:55.583 --> 10:57.792
-kicking off winter break.
-(deep voice) Winter break!

10:57.875 --> 11:01.000
-(deep voice) Winter break!
-(both laugh)

11:01.083 --> 11:02.959
Listen, I know
why you didn't tell me

11:03.041 --> 11:04.500
about your dad working for McFist,

11:04.583 --> 11:06.333
and I just want you
to know we're best friends.

11:06.417 --> 11:07.542
You can tell me anything.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.500
Cool! 'Cause I've been
meaning to tell you.

11:09.583 --> 11:12.709
I've been borrowing
your underpants for, like, months.

11:12.792 --> 11:14.709
(Randy) Ooh...
Why would you tell me that?

11:14.792 --> 11:15.625
(flatulence)

11:20.542 --> 11:21.458
Hiyah!

11:22.333 --> 11:23.959
Hiyah! (grunts)

11:24.041 --> 11:25.125
(screams)

11:25.208 --> 11:26.667
Yah! (grunts)

11:29.375 --> 11:32.750
I'm Mac Antfee,
world-famous butt-whooper.

11:32.834 --> 11:33.917
(grunting)

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
(woman) <i>Butt-whooper.</i>

11:37.333 --> 11:41.458
Give me two days, and I can turn
anyone into a ninja.

11:41.542 --> 11:43.041
Even me, Mac Antfee?

11:44.083 --> 11:45.291
Ooh!

11:45.375 --> 11:48.250
Mac Antfee's Fantasy Ninja
Camp-splosion!

11:48.333 --> 11:50.166
(woman) <i>Camp-splosion.</i>

11:50.250 --> 11:52.041
Get ready to eat fist!

11:52.125 --> 11:54.375
Two for this weekend's
Camp-splosion.

11:54.458 --> 11:56.583
Howard, I can't play Ninja
with you this weekend.

11:56.667 --> 11:59.208
Why not? We used to play Ninja
together all the time!

11:59.291 --> 12:01.750
-Hiyah! Hiyah! Hiyah!
-Hiyah! Hiyah! Hiyah!

12:01.834 --> 12:03.709
Those were the bruise-old days.

12:03.792 --> 12:06.583
Then go to Ninja Camp with me,
Cunningham.

12:06.667 --> 12:11.083
Fate and this credit card have given us
a chance to Ninja as we once did.

12:11.166 --> 12:12.166
-Yah!
-Yah!

12:12.250 --> 12:14.625
I can't. I have to stay here and train.

12:14.709 --> 12:17.375
In case you haven't noticed, I've been
off my Ninja game lately.

12:17.458 --> 12:19.125
Oh-ho, I noticed.

12:19.208 --> 12:20.792
Everybody's noticed.

12:22.750 --> 12:24.041
Ninja chop!

12:24.625 --> 12:25.625
Huh?

12:29.208 --> 12:31.083
Ooh, my bad.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.500
So you've had a few off days.

12:33.583 --> 12:36.083
Don't start questioning if you're
the right guy to be the Ninja.

12:36.166 --> 12:38.667
-I'm not!
-Neither am I.

12:39.750 --> 12:42.542
The point is, you
need to sharpen your skills.

12:42.625 --> 12:44.041
Where better than Ninja Camp?

12:44.125 --> 12:45.500
<i>Camp-splosion!</i>

12:45.583 --> 12:46.917
-(book humming)
-Seriously?

12:47.000 --> 12:48.792
We're in the middle
of a conversation here.

12:48.875 --> 12:50.709
And it's a good one.

12:50.792 --> 12:52.792
(grunts)

12:52.875 --> 12:55.000
Ah! I just got Nomiconned.

12:55.083 --> 12:56.750
(screams)

12:58.792 --> 13:01.500
I'm not the wrong guy
to be the Ninja, right?

13:02.834 --> 13:04.291
(gasps)

13:04.375 --> 13:08.083
"The questions of the present
can be answered by the past."

13:08.166 --> 13:10.625
Mac Antfee was the Ninja?

13:10.709 --> 13:15.041
He could tell me if I'm truly a Ninja or
just some shoob in black jimmy jams.

13:15.125 --> 13:17.375
Guess I'm getting my 'splosion on!

13:17.375 --> 13:19.500
(rock music)

13:22.750 --> 13:24.417
-(toilet flushing)
-(groans)

13:24.500 --> 13:25.750
(all gasping)

13:25.834 --> 13:28.250
Hey, it smelled like that
before I went in there!

13:28.333 --> 13:30.500
No, Howard, look!

13:32.834 --> 13:34.166
(both gasp)

13:34.250 --> 13:36.417
(grunting)

13:36.500 --> 13:41.166
I am Mac Antfee,
master Ninja, fitness model,

13:41.250 --> 13:43.125
and world-famous butt-whoop-smith!

13:43.208 --> 13:45.291
Mr. Antfee, it is an honor to meet you.

13:45.375 --> 13:48.041
I have so many questions.

13:48.125 --> 13:50.500
(grunting)

13:51.250 --> 13:53.083
What does it mean to be a Ninja?

13:53.166 --> 13:56.750
Being a Ninja means protecting
the weak and fighting for good, sir!

13:56.834 --> 13:59.667
Wow... not even close!

13:59.750 --> 14:02.375
Being a Ninja means
winning by any means necessary.

14:02.458 --> 14:04.041
No matter what!

14:04.125 --> 14:06.500
You're a fan of the Ninja
of Norrisville, aren't you?

14:06.583 --> 14:08.291
Oh, you and me both, right?

14:08.375 --> 14:10.250
(nervous chuckle)

14:10.333 --> 14:11.333
I don't like you.

14:11.417 --> 14:13.000
And I doubt I ever will.

14:13.083 --> 14:17.417
Aside from Johnny Nicewad here,
who's up for winning some fights?

14:17.500 --> 14:20.625
-(all shouting)
-Now, get out there and hurt each other!

14:20.709 --> 14:24.083
This guy's a little more...
intense than I expected.

14:24.166 --> 14:27.542
I know! He's like the coolest
ninja I've ever met!

14:27.625 --> 14:30.375
Second coolest, Cunningham,
second coolest.

14:30.458 --> 14:34.500
Prepare to learn
the battle-owned wisdom of the masters!

14:34.583 --> 14:36.792
-(grunting)
-I'm talking fish-hookin',

14:36.875 --> 14:39.542
foot-stompin', and a little
beauty I like to call...

14:39.625 --> 14:41.375
...the conversation-stopper!

14:41.458 --> 14:43.375
-(gasps)
-Yah!

14:43.458 --> 14:46.792
Yes! In your face, Ninja!

14:46.875 --> 14:50.166
-(snarling)
-Ha-ha! I love this guy!

14:50.250 --> 14:54.250
Really, Nomicon? This is the past Ninja
you wanted me to learn from?

14:54.333 --> 14:56.917
Okay, candy apples,

14:57.000 --> 15:00.750
time to separate the winners from whatever
you call people who don't win.

15:00.834 --> 15:04.542
I wouldn't know. I don't
hang out with un-winners.

15:04.625 --> 15:06.917
-On your mark, get set...
-(devious chuckle)

15:07.000 --> 15:08.375
(gonging)

15:08.458 --> 15:10.041
(all grunting)

15:10.125 --> 15:12.291
(all shouting)

15:14.959 --> 15:16.458
Hey, he cheated!

15:16.542 --> 15:18.417
No, he won.

15:18.500 --> 15:19.333
-Yeah!
-(groans)

15:19.417 --> 15:22.333
(Mac) Mark my words,
as a Ninja,

15:22.375 --> 15:25.667
you will find yourself staring
down the business end

15:25.750 --> 15:27.542
of a pressurized gravy cannon.

15:27.625 --> 15:29.834
-(grunts)
-You never told me about the gravy!

15:29.917 --> 15:31.875
There is no gravy.

15:31.959 --> 15:35.583
I'm starting to think
Mac's a little... off.

15:36.291 --> 15:37.750
Where's my man-gong?

15:39.333 --> 15:40.500
(gonging)

15:40.583 --> 15:42.500
(all grunting)

15:43.583 --> 15:45.375
(all grunting)

15:50.375 --> 15:51.417
(screams)

15:51.500 --> 15:52.709
(grunting continues)

15:55.166 --> 15:56.333
Huh?

15:56.417 --> 15:59.500
Help! I can't move.

16:03.458 --> 16:06.959
-(groaning)
-(grunting)

16:08.041 --> 16:10.625
-What was that?
-Braden needed help.

16:10.709 --> 16:13.625
"Braden needed help." That little weasel
out-Ninja-ed you!

16:13.709 --> 16:15.750
Time to step it up, chowder face!

16:15.834 --> 16:17.792
-(groans)
-All right, Nicewad,

16:17.875 --> 16:20.000
can't wait to see how you
totally blow this one.

16:20.083 --> 16:22.500
(weak grunting)

16:22.583 --> 16:25.291
Throw muck in his eye. Bam!

16:25.375 --> 16:29.166
-Make him eat fist!
-But he's half my size.

16:29.250 --> 16:30.959
Then you only gotta throw
half the muck.

16:31.041 --> 16:33.208
-Man-gong!
-(skidding)

16:33.291 --> 16:35.208
(grunts)

16:35.291 --> 16:38.083
-(both grunting)
-Braden, I'm not gonna... Ah!

16:38.166 --> 16:41.333
Are you...? What...?
Your hands are so tiny!

16:41.417 --> 16:44.250
-(Braden laughs, grunting)
-Ah!

16:44.333 --> 16:47.583
Winner! This little twerp's got
the spirit of Ninja in him!

16:47.667 --> 16:50.125
-Winner! Winner! Both winners!
-(both) Yeah!

16:50.208 --> 16:51.875
Everyone makes
the Smackdown Squad...

16:51.959 --> 16:53.500
-(all cheering)
-...except you.

16:53.583 --> 16:55.667
You are not a Ninja.

16:55.750 --> 16:57.583
Not now, not ever!

16:57.667 --> 16:59.500
Come, my Macolytes,

16:59.583 --> 17:01.500
join me in the Pagoda
of Infinite Knowledge.

17:01.583 --> 17:03.667
Where you will receive your
Smackdown suits

17:03.750 --> 17:07.250
and coupons good for ten percent off
anything in the Smackdown shop!

17:07.333 --> 17:08.959
(all cheering)

17:09.041 --> 17:11.041
Slappage! Hah!

17:11.125 --> 17:13.417
If we could get the slappage
happening, that would be great.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.000
I got a tent of wisdom to get to.

17:16.083 --> 17:18.625
It's the Pagoda of Knowledge.

17:18.709 --> 17:21.041
And it's stupid.
This whole place is stupid.

17:21.125 --> 17:23.166
How could you make the squad
and I didn't?

17:23.250 --> 17:25.000
I'm the Ninja!

17:25.083 --> 17:28.375
Are you? 'Cause right now,
you're acting like a real chowder-face.

17:28.458 --> 17:31.792
Smoke bomb, Cunningham,
smoke bomb.

17:31.875 --> 17:32.709
(groans)

17:32.792 --> 17:34.792
(grunting)

17:34.875 --> 17:37.166
What am I supposed
to learn from that psycho?

17:37.250 --> 17:39.667
If that's the kind of Ninja
I'm supposed to be,

17:39.750 --> 17:41.375
then you got the wrong freshman.

17:41.458 --> 17:43.041
-(humming)
-(grunts)

17:44.625 --> 17:46.041
-(grunts)
-You are condemned

17:46.125 --> 17:48.458
for conduct unbecoming a ninja.

17:48.542 --> 17:50.542
Turn in your mask.

17:50.625 --> 17:53.166
-Huh?
-You can't do this!

17:53.250 --> 17:54.500
I'm Mac Antfee!

17:54.583 --> 17:57.041
Someday, I'll come back
for that ninja suit.

17:57.125 --> 18:00.625
And when I get it, I'll kick
every butt in Norrisville!

18:01.709 --> 18:04.500
"The questions of the present
can be answered by the past."

18:04.583 --> 18:05.750
(gasps)

18:10.250 --> 18:13.250
You could've just told me
Mac Antfee was a nutjob.

18:13.333 --> 18:18.583
What was this, some kind of test?
Oh, my ninja, it was a test!

18:18.667 --> 18:20.208
And I aced it!

18:20.291 --> 18:22.458
I am the right guy to be the Ninja.

18:22.542 --> 18:25.709
Mac Antfee, prepare to
get your butt whooped

18:25.792 --> 18:27.417
by a nicewad.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.250
You have proved you will
do anything to win.

18:32.333 --> 18:36.667
Now you must prove you will do anything
for Mac Antfee to win!

18:36.750 --> 18:40.000
-(all) Yeah!
-Begin the Mac Antfee Loyalty Oath.

18:40.083 --> 18:44.333
It is the spark that lights the
fuse of your ninja-splosion.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
Repeat after me:

18:47.083 --> 18:49.875
Mac Antfee is the one true ninja.

18:49.959 --> 18:52.375
(all) Mac Antfee is the one true ninja.

18:52.458 --> 18:55.625
I follow every order Mac gives
without question.

18:55.709 --> 18:59.417
(all) I follow every order
Mac gives without question.

18:59.500 --> 19:01.291
The Ninja of Norrisville is a jerk!

19:01.375 --> 19:04.417
-(all) The Ninja of Norrisville is a jerk!
-Hang on a second.

19:04.500 --> 19:07.625
We will find him, crush him,
strip him of his suit,

19:07.709 --> 19:10.709
give said suit to Mac Antfee,
and applaud loudly

19:10.792 --> 19:14.291
as Mac Antfee kicks every butt
in Norrisville!

19:14.375 --> 19:16.500
-(crickets chirping)
-Just say "okay"!

19:16.583 --> 19:19.333
(all) Okay! Crush the Ninja!

19:19.417 --> 19:21.500
-(all repeating)
-I'm not really much of a chanter,

19:21.583 --> 19:25.333
so I'm gonna... On second
thought, I could chant.

19:25.417 --> 19:27.083
-Hah!
-Ninja!

19:27.166 --> 19:29.125
-Ninja!
-Oh, hey, Mac.

19:29.208 --> 19:32.333
Thought I'd stop by, see how
the whole 'splosion's going.

19:32.375 --> 19:34.875
-Red Suits, this is my moment.
-(all shouting)

19:34.959 --> 19:38.041
This is why we meet every first
and third Saturday of the month.

19:38.125 --> 19:39.291
This is the time!

19:40.041 --> 19:42.000
Let him eat fist!

19:42.083 --> 19:44.375
Looks like it's just you and me.

19:44.458 --> 19:45.875
You know you don't have to do this.

19:45.959 --> 19:47.959
Perfect. I'm gonna go hide in the kitchen.

19:48.041 --> 19:49.125
Uh-oh.

19:50.500 --> 19:52.542
Unleash the 'splosion!

19:53.667 --> 19:56.333
(grunting)

19:56.417 --> 19:58.291
(grunts)

19:58.375 --> 20:00.500
Hiyah! Hiyah! Hiyah!

20:02.291 --> 20:04.375
-Attack!
-(grunts)

20:04.458 --> 20:06.166
I got this.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.250
(both shouting)

20:10.333 --> 20:12.583
-(grunting)
-Ow! Oh! Ow!

20:14.166 --> 20:16.250
-A-ha!
-(Mac) Finally,

20:16.333 --> 20:19.792
I will take the suit back and
make the world kiss my butt.

20:19.875 --> 20:22.166
Not while I'm the Ninja.

20:22.250 --> 20:24.000
-(shouting)
-Ooh!

20:24.750 --> 20:26.291
Huh? What?

20:26.375 --> 20:30.583
You didn't think I was gonna fight you?
You got the suit, it wouldn't be fair.

20:30.667 --> 20:31.792
You are dumb.

20:31.875 --> 20:34.125
Hand over the mask.

20:34.208 --> 20:36.792
No honking way.

20:36.875 --> 20:38.291
-(snaps fingers)
-(Randy) Howard!

20:38.375 --> 20:41.667
Just so you know, Ninja,
I totally took down that shoob, Braden.

20:41.750 --> 20:43.542
And then these guys showed up.

20:43.625 --> 20:45.667
You have betrayed me, Macolyte.

20:45.750 --> 20:48.917
Yeah, well, that's 'cause I
realized you were wiggety-nuts!

20:49.000 --> 20:50.500
(screams)

20:50.583 --> 20:52.500
Give me the mask or I drop him!

20:52.583 --> 20:55.583
Don't do it, Ninja.
What am I saying? Give him the mask!

20:55.667 --> 20:58.500
Fine. Just one thing. Smoke bomb!

20:58.583 --> 21:01.041
-(grunts)
-It's not possible!

21:01.125 --> 21:02.959
That kid has escaped, bro!

21:03.041 --> 21:06.709
Hey, why don't you reel me in
and we'll look for him together?

21:06.792 --> 21:08.083
-(beeping)
-(whirring)

21:09.166 --> 21:10.917
Ninja bluff! Hiyah!

21:11.000 --> 21:13.417
(screams)

21:13.500 --> 21:15.917
(grunts) Let him go!

21:16.000 --> 21:17.750
You just read my mind.

21:17.834 --> 21:19.417
(screams)

21:21.333 --> 21:22.875
(grunts)

21:23.834 --> 21:26.333
(grunts) Don't mean to be ungrateful, but

21:26.417 --> 21:28.709
you're giving me
an epic wedgie right now!

21:28.792 --> 21:32.041
Hiyah. Hiyah. (grunts)
Where's Mac Antfee?

21:32.125 --> 21:36.125
Hey, Ninja, sorry about that
whole trying-to-take-you-down thing.

21:36.208 --> 21:38.166
We just kinda assumed it was
part of the 'splosion.

21:38.250 --> 21:42.208
It's cool. I'm just thankful one of you
stuck with me through it all.

21:42.291 --> 21:44.208
This dainty-handed warrior

21:44.291 --> 21:47.709
possesses the spirit of a true Ninja.

21:47.792 --> 21:50.417
Yeah! In your face, Braden!

21:50.500 --> 21:51.500
Smoke bomb!

21:52.291 --> 21:55.250
Ah, Ninja Camp, great idea, Howard.

21:55.333 --> 21:56.875
You know, we should go again next year.

21:56.959 --> 21:59.125
Hey, don't be bitter, Cunningham.

21:59.208 --> 22:01.291
So you're not cut out for Ninja Camp.

22:01.375 --> 22:03.458
You're just too much of a nicewad.

22:03.542 --> 22:06.000
Guess you're just gonna
have to settle for being the best Ninja

22:06.083 --> 22:09.166
Norrisville ever had.
Of course, you did let Mac get away.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.041
I'm Mac Antfee.

22:12.125 --> 22:13.542
World-famous butt-whooper.

22:13.625 --> 22:15.959
And I will 'splode again!

22:18.750 --> 22:19.834
