00:44.170 --> 00:45.755
Aster!

00:51.844 --> 00:53.304
Aster!

01:08.194 --> 01:09.987
- They're not coming in.
- They're forcing the doors open.

01:38.015 --> 01:40.226
<i>Beacon 23,
this is the Crest.</i>

01:40.226 --> 01:42.186
<i>We're entering your sector.</i>

01:45.898 --> 01:48.901
<i>Beacon 23,
this is the Crest.</i>

01:48.901 --> 01:51.070
<i>We're entering your sector.</i>

01:56.700 --> 02:00.287
<i>Beacon 23,
do you copy?</i>

02:07.670 --> 02:09.380
- This can't be right.
<i>- Beacon 23,</i>

02:09.380 --> 02:11.006
<i>we've got eight passengers
on board.</i>

02:11.006 --> 02:13.968
<i>We're pulling five years of
supplies for the Eshu colonies.</i>

02:13.968 --> 02:15.469
What the hell is going on here?

02:15.469 --> 02:17.012
<i>We'll be crossing
your space soon.</i>

02:23.769 --> 02:26.522
Crest, this is Beacon 23.
You are not cleared.

02:26.522 --> 02:29.483
There's too much dark matter.
Do you copy?

02:29.483 --> 02:32.528
Reroute, Crest,
it isn't safe.

02:32.528 --> 02:34.238
<i>Beacon 23?</i>

02:40.995 --> 02:43.497
<i>It would've been nice to have
heard your voice, but all good.</i>

02:43.497 --> 02:46.000
<i>- I see we are clear.</i>
- Damn it!

02:46.000 --> 02:48.836
Crest, do you hear me?
You are not clear.

03:24.997 --> 03:26.165
Shit!

03:44.767 --> 03:46.185
<i>I don't understand.</i>

03:46.185 --> 03:48.562
<i>Beacon 23, are we clear
for passage?</i>

03:58.238 --> 04:01.492
<i>Got it. Thanks, B23,
we are headed your way.</i>

04:01.492 --> 04:03.452
<i>Maybe we'll stop in for a beer
in nine months--</i>

04:16.131 --> 04:18.842
No...

04:33.107 --> 04:34.483
How much time do they have?

04:39.363 --> 04:41.198
Retrieval time?

06:37.856 --> 06:39.817
Hey. Hey, it's okay.

06:41.819 --> 06:43.779
It's okay.

06:43.779 --> 06:46.406
You're okay.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.783
You understand me?

06:51.286 --> 06:53.539
Here.

07:00.587 --> 07:02.506
Don't worry, that'll stop.

07:02.506 --> 07:03.841
You just got out
of the bubble too quick.

07:03.841 --> 07:05.092
It crosses the wires.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.138
I'm gonna give you something.

07:16.395 --> 07:17.938
Derma-patch.

07:17.938 --> 07:20.065
It's a strong one,
all right?

07:26.029 --> 07:27.823
That's a good soldier.

07:40.043 --> 07:42.212
Hey, easy. Careful.

07:42.212 --> 07:43.964
Your ship just crashed.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.591
The Crest?

07:49.803 --> 07:53.390
I'm sorry, all hands lost.

07:59.771 --> 08:02.065
Did you have any family
aboard or...?

08:04.735 --> 08:05.652
No.

08:06.778 --> 08:09.323
I... I was alone.

08:09.323 --> 08:10.991
There's a voice.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.534
Welcome back.

08:12.534 --> 08:14.077
What happened?

08:17.372 --> 08:19.458
Beacon malfunctioned.

08:19.458 --> 08:22.252
Map said stop, GWB said go.

08:23.962 --> 08:26.715
The Gravity Wave Broadcaster.

08:26.715 --> 08:29.635
I mean, I rebooted it.
I... I tried manual reset.

08:29.635 --> 08:31.511
I don't know.
I think I'm being hacked.

08:36.350 --> 08:38.018
You hungry?

08:38.018 --> 08:39.353
Yeah.

08:40.729 --> 08:41.897
Mm!

08:46.360 --> 08:47.611
Mm, thank you.

08:47.611 --> 08:49.488
Tastes like shit
but it does the job.

08:49.488 --> 08:52.032
I'll let the chef know.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.283
I can get you another one
if you'd like.

08:53.283 --> 08:56.161
No.
No, I'm good.

08:56.161 --> 08:57.621
I'm gonna regret that later.

08:57.621 --> 08:59.748
But I do feel...

08:59.748 --> 09:01.208
good.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.711
Oddly great, even.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.505
Mm.
Yeah, that's the derma.

09:08.131 --> 09:09.591
It'll wear off, sorry to say.

09:12.386 --> 09:13.553
We're out there, huh?

09:14.972 --> 09:17.391
It's a pretty sweet view
to wake up to.

09:18.976 --> 09:20.769
Yeah.

09:20.769 --> 09:23.063
I've never been this side
of Orion before.

09:23.063 --> 09:25.482
- Feels familiar.
- Yeah, that'll happen.

09:25.482 --> 09:28.652
Coming out the bubble sideways,
it gives you déjà vu.

09:30.779 --> 09:32.281
Is that all from the Crest?

09:34.574 --> 09:36.827
Yeah, those data haulers, they
really know how to pack 'em.

09:38.287 --> 09:40.747
Especially out here,
this side of the galaxy.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.374
It's the only way
they get any updates.

09:44.334 --> 09:45.711
Two hundred years ago,

09:45.711 --> 09:47.170
we beamed everything
at the speed of light.

09:48.547 --> 09:50.007
And now we're back to...

09:51.216 --> 09:52.759
...stuffing shit in boxes.

09:52.759 --> 09:55.053
Yeah, I guess so.

09:58.724 --> 09:59.933
No way.

09:59.933 --> 10:02.185
Is that a beta series?

10:02.185 --> 10:04.730
I love these guys.

10:06.523 --> 10:08.066
Come here,
you little bugger.

10:08.066 --> 10:10.861
Yeah, he does that.
Don't take it personally.

10:13.322 --> 10:14.865
Huh!

10:14.865 --> 10:16.616
By the way, I'm Solomon.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.577
Yeah. I know.

10:18.577 --> 10:19.661
I said that?

10:20.996 --> 10:21.913
Hm.

10:23.540 --> 10:25.000
Okay.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.502
Anyway, you're on a beacon.

10:27.502 --> 10:29.338
Yeah, I know that too.

10:32.215 --> 10:33.508
Right.

10:33.508 --> 10:36.803
Look, I don't know
where you were going,

10:36.803 --> 10:38.138
but if you need help
getting back--

10:38.138 --> 10:39.765
This... this is where
I was going. Beacon 23.

10:41.391 --> 10:42.976
But they sent the thing
months ago,

10:42.976 --> 10:44.478
I can't believe no one told you
I was coming.

10:45.604 --> 10:46.563
No.

10:47.898 --> 10:49.649
Who are you?

10:49.649 --> 10:51.401
Aster.

10:51.401 --> 10:52.819
What are you doing here?

10:52.819 --> 10:55.072
Okay, let's start again,
all right?

10:55.072 --> 10:57.657
- Uh, the reports you sent--
- What reports?

10:59.826 --> 11:01.036
The reports.

11:02.412 --> 11:04.289
Mineral deposits,
unknown isotopes,

11:04.289 --> 11:05.957
nothing ever seen before.

11:05.957 --> 11:07.626
Those reports,
they don't sound familiar?

11:10.462 --> 11:13.173
Yeah... um...

11:13.173 --> 11:15.300
- Yeah. Of course, I--
- Yeah, those reports.

11:15.300 --> 11:17.260
That's why I'm here.
It's what I do.

11:17.260 --> 11:19.471
Right, I just...

11:19.471 --> 11:21.139
I didn't expect anyone to--

11:21.139 --> 11:23.558
Well, it's been, what, a year?

11:23.558 --> 11:25.310
I don't blame you,
but folks in Mission Control,

11:25.310 --> 11:26.853
they're interested, so...

11:28.397 --> 11:32.067
...here I am.
Barely, I guess.

11:32.067 --> 11:36.029
I just need the samples
and access to any data--

11:36.029 --> 11:37.072
No.

11:40.534 --> 11:43.453
- No?
- Yeah, you can't access it...

11:43.453 --> 11:44.913
AI is malfunctioning,
I said that already.

11:44.913 --> 11:46.248
Well, what's malfunctioning?

11:46.248 --> 11:47.958
The AI, the whole beacon?

11:47.958 --> 11:49.668
No! Okay?
I just said no!

11:51.628 --> 11:53.171
Didn't you hear me?

11:54.673 --> 11:55.882
Yeah.

11:57.509 --> 11:59.928
Loud and clear.

11:59.928 --> 12:01.763
Goddamn...

12:04.015 --> 12:07.227
It's just...

12:07.227 --> 12:10.772
...it's been so long
since I've even...

12:10.772 --> 12:12.691
...and I gotta deal with
the crash, and the reports.

12:14.192 --> 12:16.445
- I got a lot of work to do.
- Yeah, we all do.

12:16.445 --> 12:19.322
Yeah, and first thing's first,
I gotta figure out the protocol.

12:19.322 --> 12:22.576
- Right. Protocol.
- Yeah, okay?

12:22.576 --> 12:24.578
I gotta figure out
what happened with the GWB,

12:24.578 --> 12:26.955
and then we can talk
about the reports.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.625
Why don't you...

12:32.711 --> 12:36.173
...why don't you just
have a rest, hm?

12:36.173 --> 12:39.301
Yeah, you should get some rest.
Just go back down to the dock.

12:40.886 --> 12:42.637
We'll talk in the morning, okay?

12:47.100 --> 12:49.644
Um, can I take my bag?

12:49.644 --> 12:51.897
Or is that against protocol?

13:27.974 --> 13:29.476
Harmony, wake.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.394
<i>Hello, Aster.</i>

13:31.394 --> 13:33.772
<i>I'm afraid I'm not myself.</i>

13:33.772 --> 13:35.607
How long?

13:35.607 --> 13:38.485
<i>I don't have the processing
power yet to answer that.</i>

13:38.485 --> 13:40.111
Great.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.491
What about the data?
Can you access the data?

13:44.491 --> 13:47.702
<i>Um, not yet, unfortunately.</i>

13:47.702 --> 13:49.704
<i>- Aster.</i>
- Yeah?

13:49.704 --> 13:51.831
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

13:53.458 --> 13:55.460
Solomon, Beacon Keeper,
he's, um...

13:55.460 --> 13:57.045
antisocial.

13:57.045 --> 13:58.713
Uncooperative.

13:58.713 --> 14:01.508
<i>- More than expected?</i>
- More hostile, I guess.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.178
You let me know
when you're up and running.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.097
<i>I'm sure I'll be fine.
Don't worry about me.</i>

14:07.097 --> 14:08.390
<i>- You be careful.</i>
- I will.

15:45.236 --> 15:47.614
You knew about this,
didn't you?

15:50.033 --> 15:51.576
So, what,
they sent you a message,

15:51.576 --> 15:52.952
and you just decided
not to tell me?

15:56.998 --> 15:58.792
If she goes poking around
too much,

15:58.792 --> 16:00.085
you know whose fault that is?

16:02.087 --> 16:04.297
If I gotta get rid of her,
that's on you.

16:47.215 --> 16:49.300
It's impressive.
Is it true?

16:50.635 --> 16:52.637
Sorry, my beep bop's
a bit rusty.

16:54.681 --> 16:55.890
What happened to Solomon?

16:57.517 --> 16:59.394
I don't get ya.

17:01.646 --> 17:03.690
Where is he now?

17:05.942 --> 17:07.610
Do you know where
the samples are?

17:08.945 --> 17:10.321
Show me.

17:58.536 --> 18:00.163
These the only samples?

19:04.352 --> 19:06.312
Can you show me files
on the reports?

19:08.356 --> 19:11.025
Show me files
related to the minerals.

19:13.027 --> 19:14.654
Hey, wait!

19:17.782 --> 19:18.700
Hm.

19:29.294 --> 19:31.004
Someone's been
breaking the rules.

19:32.213 --> 19:33.965
Play three.

19:45.768 --> 19:48.730
- Enlarge that.
<i>- Oh, Bart.</i>

19:48.730 --> 19:51.691
<i>Be a dear.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees</i>

19:51.691 --> 19:55.153
<i>and print a couple sheets
of ginger, yes?</i>

19:55.153 --> 19:57.071
<i>- And...</i>
- Freeze there.

19:57.071 --> 19:58.489
Identify.

20:06.122 --> 20:07.540
What are you doing?

20:09.208 --> 20:11.085
I'm sorry.
I was just, um...

20:13.254 --> 20:14.631
I said, what are you doing?

20:16.007 --> 20:17.425
My job, really.

20:19.802 --> 20:21.304
Did I say
you could come up here?

20:23.431 --> 20:25.058
In fact, um,

20:25.058 --> 20:27.644
I'm pretty sure
I told you not to.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.021
Well, they're expecting
a report from me--

20:30.021 --> 20:31.731
- That's not my problem.
- It's mine.

20:35.818 --> 20:36.903
Look, I'm just gonna
head downstairs--

20:36.903 --> 20:38.488
No, stop!

20:39.906 --> 20:41.199
What's on that screen?

20:44.202 --> 20:46.120
Bart, if you don't move
right now, so help me God!

20:53.169 --> 20:55.713
I can explain.

20:55.713 --> 20:57.507
- No need.
- No, obviously I do,

20:57.507 --> 20:59.759
because you're wondering
why I don't look like Solomon,

20:59.759 --> 21:00.885
and that's
'cause I'm not Solomon.

21:00.885 --> 21:02.178
- I'm not--
- My name is Halan.

21:07.809 --> 21:09.894
Look, I...
I have no legal--

21:09.894 --> 21:12.063
The real Solomon stole my ship
and left.

21:15.191 --> 21:16.901
Whatever happened, I don't need
to know, I'm just gonna--

21:16.901 --> 21:18.528
You're not listening to me,
are you?

21:18.528 --> 21:20.238
I don't know Solomon!
All right?

21:20.238 --> 21:21.656
I don't know anyone!

21:21.656 --> 21:23.783
I just collect samples
and write reports.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.284
That's what I do.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.869
So I'll just make
my own way out.

21:26.869 --> 21:28.496
- Oh, you will, huh?
- Yeah!

21:28.496 --> 21:30.540
What are you gonna do, just
space walk out of here, hm?

21:30.540 --> 21:31.708
Who's picking you up?

21:31.708 --> 21:32.917
My ship crashed!

21:32.917 --> 21:35.086
What, do you think
I'm stupid, hm?

21:35.086 --> 21:36.504
The Crest
isn't coming back for you.

21:36.504 --> 21:38.172
When is ISA picking you up?

21:38.172 --> 21:40.508
Look, please,
just back up, all right?

21:43.428 --> 21:45.346
Or what?

21:45.346 --> 21:46.723
What are you gonna do?

23:14.519 --> 23:16.646
Hello.

23:16.646 --> 23:18.898
I'm sure we have a lot
of questions for each other.

23:20.733 --> 23:23.277
Yes, I'm her personal AI.

23:28.074 --> 23:29.700
Where is she now?

23:54.559 --> 23:56.227
Aster?

24:01.732 --> 24:02.775
Aster!

24:35.516 --> 24:36.517
Hey.

24:39.061 --> 24:40.062
Hi.

24:41.397 --> 24:42.273
Who are you?

24:43.524 --> 24:44.901
I'm Harmony.

25:01.125 --> 25:02.418
You went AWOL, didn't you?

25:05.046 --> 25:06.339
Hey.

25:06.339 --> 25:08.716
You weren't stranded,
you were hiding.

25:10.301 --> 25:11.719
Where's Solomon?

25:11.719 --> 25:13.429
I told you, he's gone.

25:13.429 --> 25:15.181
Gone where, Halan?

25:15.181 --> 25:16.974
- I don't know.
- <i>Oh, he knows.</i>

25:16.974 --> 25:18.976
<i>- Of course he knows.</i>
- Bart?

25:18.976 --> 25:21.437
<i>My name is not Bart,
nor is it AI,</i>

25:21.437 --> 25:23.564
<i>nor ship nor dumbass.</i>

25:23.564 --> 25:25.399
<i>My name is Bartholomew.</i>

25:25.399 --> 25:27.818
<i>My human counterpart
was Solomon.</i>

25:27.818 --> 25:29.445
<i>- He called me Bart.</i>
- Bart, stop.

25:29.445 --> 25:31.239
<i>I'd prefer if you didn't.</i>

25:31.239 --> 25:34.033
<i>I use the past tense because
Solomon is no longer alive.</i>

25:34.033 --> 25:35.576
Goddamn it, Bart.

25:35.576 --> 25:37.370
<i>He was murdered,
after being imprisoned</i>

25:37.370 --> 25:39.497
<i>and tortured by this person.</i>

25:39.497 --> 25:41.374
That isn't half of the story,
and you know it.

25:41.374 --> 25:42.792
Aster. Aster!

25:42.792 --> 25:43.834
Please, you gotta--

25:47.880 --> 25:49.674
I saved your life!

25:50.883 --> 25:52.009
I have a job to do.

25:56.180 --> 25:58.474
Aster, you come back here!

25:58.474 --> 26:01.269
Aster! Aster!

26:07.817 --> 26:08.818
Aster!

26:12.863 --> 26:14.198
<i>Tout suite.</i>

26:15.491 --> 26:16.367
<i>Cut!</i>

26:19.078 --> 26:20.621
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

26:22.456 --> 26:23.958
<i>Could you please...</i>

26:25.501 --> 26:27.503
<i>Cut it, you rusted bucket.</i>

26:27.503 --> 26:28.879
All right, enough.

26:28.879 --> 26:31.299
This Solomon guy's
a piece of work.

26:31.299 --> 26:33.592
True.
But not a liar.

26:34.677 --> 26:37.388
Solomon's chemical analysis
confirms your intuition.

26:38.556 --> 26:40.933
The element is unknown.

26:40.933 --> 26:43.644
- Didn't I tell you I was right?
- Ah, you told us.

26:43.644 --> 26:45.855
Mm, Coley said it was a waste
of time, but I knew I was right.

26:45.855 --> 26:48.649
It was a bold move, Aster.
Your gamble paid off.

26:48.649 --> 26:49.984
Well, not yet, it hasn't.

26:49.984 --> 26:51.902
I've still got more
analysis to do.

26:51.902 --> 26:54.613
- And we got, what, two samples?
- Correct.

26:56.449 --> 26:58.784
And he took how many trips
over the years, 100?

26:58.784 --> 27:01.871
One hundred seventy-two trips
over nine years.

27:01.871 --> 27:03.748
<i>Solomon was
very security conscious.</i>

27:03.748 --> 27:06.375
<i>He took every precaution
to protect his discoveries,</i>

27:06.375 --> 27:08.336
<i>- even hiding them from me.</i>
- Yeah, I know.

27:08.336 --> 27:10.046
It just makes my job
more difficult.

27:10.046 --> 27:11.964
<i>Oh, this... this never
would have happened</i>

27:11.964 --> 27:13.883
<i>if Solomon were still alive.</i>

27:13.883 --> 27:16.427
<i>He would have had the silicate
beautifully arrayed for you.</i>

27:16.427 --> 27:18.262
<i>But then he was
horrifically murdered.</i>

27:18.262 --> 27:19.889
Hm, tragic loss.

27:19.889 --> 27:22.350
<i>This should've been the
greatest day of Solomon's life.</i>

27:22.350 --> 27:24.685
<i>Instead, he's gone,
victim of a brutal homicide.</i>

27:24.685 --> 27:27.521
<i>- I cannot--</i>
- You can, and you have.

27:27.521 --> 27:28.981
Numerous times.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.483
Did you hear what
he called you, Bart?

27:30.483 --> 27:33.444
<i>The presence of an ISA official
is at least some solace.</i>

27:33.444 --> 27:35.738
<i>Do you think Halan
will be executed?</i>

27:35.738 --> 27:37.782
<i>His crimes certainly meet
the criteria for malice</i>

27:37.782 --> 27:40.242
<i>- and forethought.</i>
- I don't know.

27:40.242 --> 27:43.245
Bart, we need some privacy.
Would you scan the beacon again?

27:43.245 --> 27:45.748
If anyone can find
the silicate samples, it's you.

27:45.748 --> 27:47.666
<i>It's my honor to assist</i>

27:47.666 --> 27:50.336
<i>the Interstellar Space Authority
in any capacity.</i>

27:50.336 --> 27:52.630
Thank you.
He's been isolated too long.

27:52.630 --> 27:55.007
His interpersonal skills are--

27:55.007 --> 27:57.760
Hold, please.
Quantum data packet arriving.

27:57.760 --> 27:59.553
- Word from a cutter?
- Yeah.

28:01.222 --> 28:03.099
Extraction team is en route.

28:03.099 --> 28:05.601
Estimated arrival,
35 to 40 hours.

28:16.904 --> 28:18.697
Who doesn't like soy sauce?

28:32.503 --> 28:34.171
Noticed you weren't eating.

28:38.676 --> 28:40.511
What, are you worried
I'm gonna waste away?

28:42.888 --> 28:44.682
How long you planning
on keeping me in here?

28:45.933 --> 28:47.977
'Til my transport gets here.

28:47.977 --> 28:50.938
- And when's that?
- Soon enough.

28:50.938 --> 28:52.773
You don't have
to keep me locked up.

28:52.773 --> 28:55.401
You're an AWOL pilot
who killed a Beacon Keeper--

28:55.401 --> 28:56.694
I didn't kill Solomon!

29:01.157 --> 29:02.324
God!

29:06.871 --> 29:08.205
I'm sorry.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.962
I used to be better
at this.

29:23.721 --> 29:25.723
Aster, I need to get outta here.

29:25.723 --> 29:26.891
I'm not letting you
out of the Airlock.

29:26.891 --> 29:29.435
No, not the Airlock,
off the beacon.

29:29.435 --> 29:31.353
Let me take the Picker,
I'll disappear, and you'll never

29:31.353 --> 29:32.813
- have to deal with me again.
- Not happening.

29:32.813 --> 29:35.232
Just say I escaped,
I overpowered you.

29:35.232 --> 29:36.734
No one would blame you.

29:41.864 --> 29:43.699
You okay?

29:49.622 --> 29:50.831
Halan, you okay?

29:50.831 --> 29:52.374
No, no, I'm not okay.

29:52.374 --> 29:54.084
I can't be here
when your ISA buddies show up.

29:54.084 --> 29:56.504
Look, I...

29:56.504 --> 29:59.048
I came down here to talk
to you, to understand.

29:59.048 --> 30:00.633
I can put in a good
word for you.

30:00.633 --> 30:03.135
Don't you get it?
I'm a deserter.

30:03.135 --> 30:07.056
You help me find the samples
Solomon collected.

30:11.685 --> 30:12.895
Halan?

30:15.523 --> 30:17.399
Hey.

30:17.399 --> 30:18.567
Halan, look at me.

30:22.780 --> 30:25.199
You need his rocks.

30:25.199 --> 30:27.952
Yeah.
Do you know where they are?

30:29.703 --> 30:30.913
- Sarge?
- Halan?

30:33.582 --> 30:34.750
Halan, look at me.

30:41.382 --> 30:42.550
No!

30:53.060 --> 30:54.853
There's something wrong
with him, Harmony.

30:56.772 --> 30:59.400
He was hearing voices.

30:59.400 --> 31:01.235
Saw something that scared him.

31:01.235 --> 31:02.903
His heart rate's elevated,
but respirations are low.

31:05.614 --> 31:07.616
What's that condition
soldiers get?

31:07.616 --> 31:09.285
Hallucinations, headaches?

31:09.285 --> 31:11.662
Post Traumatic
Stress Disorder.

31:11.662 --> 31:14.206
<i>PTSD has been eliminated
from the service branches.</i>

31:14.206 --> 31:17.459
<i>The last documented case
was 73 years ago.</i>

31:17.459 --> 31:20.212
Because they gave them pharma
after every mission.

31:22.256 --> 31:24.258
- Harmony?
- Printing now.

31:24.258 --> 31:26.635
<i>I object very strongly
to this plan.</i>

31:26.635 --> 31:28.596
Objection noted.

31:28.596 --> 31:31.849
<i>Halan is without scruples,
he is capable of any treachery.</i>

31:31.849 --> 31:33.892
<i>This is a ruse, an act.</i>

31:33.892 --> 31:35.978
He's not a good enough liar
for this to be an act.

31:35.978 --> 31:38.188
<i>To enter is too great a risk.</i>

31:38.188 --> 31:39.982
Harmony?

31:39.982 --> 31:42.443
In the event of my demise,

31:42.443 --> 31:45.029
please emphasize in the report
that Bart warned me.

31:45.029 --> 31:46.488
Will do.

31:55.706 --> 31:57.958
Brought you something.

32:00.252 --> 32:02.921
- I'll pass.
- Just take it.

32:02.921 --> 32:05.299
It's gonna help with the noises,
and the throwing things...

32:09.386 --> 32:10.554
Bart?

32:12.014 --> 32:13.015
Open the door.

32:14.350 --> 32:15.768
Harmony, get Bart
to open the door.

32:15.768 --> 32:17.353
He's not responding.

32:17.353 --> 32:19.063
You weren't expecting that,
were you?

32:20.105 --> 32:22.316
In the service, that's what
we call a tactical error.

32:22.316 --> 32:23.817
Really?

32:25.027 --> 32:26.987
Because from where I'm standing,
it's called compassion.

32:26.987 --> 32:28.489
Yeah.

32:28.489 --> 32:31.450
Look, you have Post Traumatic
Stress Disorder.

32:31.450 --> 32:33.911
That's the dose you missed
when you went AWOL.

32:35.329 --> 32:39.375
So what,
I should just believe you?

32:39.375 --> 32:41.585
What, you think I want to be
down here playing medic?

32:41.585 --> 32:43.087
Those prints
could be anything.

32:43.087 --> 32:44.797
They could leave me catatonic.

32:44.797 --> 32:46.882
Or they could make
you feel better.

32:46.882 --> 32:48.384
It's a win-win.

32:48.384 --> 32:50.135
You must really need
those rocks.

32:50.135 --> 32:51.845
It was a big risk
coming back in here.

32:51.845 --> 32:53.305
Not really.

32:55.766 --> 32:58.977
I came back here because I know
what it's like to be alone.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.813
Completely alone,
day after day.

33:00.813 --> 33:02.314
Being in suspension
doesn't count.

33:02.314 --> 33:05.317
All right, how about 74 days
in quarantine, awake,

33:05.317 --> 33:07.236
in a cargo port
in Sector 91?

33:08.570 --> 33:10.114
I was way out
on an exoplanet,

33:10.114 --> 33:11.573
evaluating a potential mine.

33:11.573 --> 33:13.992
ISA said I had to quarantine
before I came back in.

33:13.992 --> 33:16.370
The cargo port was the only
place that would take me.

33:16.370 --> 33:18.247
So what, your Harbor Master
didn't like you?

33:20.332 --> 33:22.710
No more Harbor Masters
in those facilities.

33:22.710 --> 33:25.462
Yeah, all right, it was nice.

33:25.462 --> 33:28.757
There was hydration
and nutrition

33:28.757 --> 33:31.009
and everything was automated.

33:31.009 --> 33:34.430
But there wasn't this.
There was none of this.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.851
So, what'd you do?

33:38.851 --> 33:42.146
What, besides wanking?

33:42.146 --> 33:44.440
I thought about all the things
I try to avoid thinking about.

33:46.734 --> 33:48.902
I thought about how
I'll never see my sister again.

33:48.902 --> 33:50.654
Because even if I take time
off work,

33:50.654 --> 33:53.115
she'll be dead
by the time I get there.

33:53.115 --> 33:55.117
And how I won't take time
off work because if I do,

33:55.117 --> 33:56.660
I'm scared they'll relegate me.

33:58.662 --> 34:00.831
And how I've spent half
my adult life in suspension,

34:00.831 --> 34:03.250
which is great if you want
to avoid all those things,

34:03.250 --> 34:06.336
but it's shit
for relationships.

34:08.839 --> 34:10.549
Take it, don't take it.

34:12.634 --> 34:13.886
Trust me.

34:16.054 --> 34:18.015
I wouldn't do anything
to make this worse for you.

34:21.518 --> 34:23.187
Bart, open the door.
I'm leaving now.

34:23.187 --> 34:24.730
He's not gonna try to escape.

34:26.982 --> 34:27.858
Don't say a word.

35:09.525 --> 35:12.027
He had a hundred bags,
where are they?

35:12.027 --> 35:15.113
The story about being stranded,
that was inspired.

35:16.782 --> 35:18.367
Bart, privacy mode.

35:18.367 --> 35:20.369
<i>Very well.</i>

35:20.369 --> 35:21.787
He's clear.

35:21.787 --> 35:24.206
What sector did I say,
with Halan?

35:24.206 --> 35:26.834
Sector 91, 74 days.

35:26.834 --> 35:28.794
But then you just left
the pharma.

35:28.794 --> 35:30.170
You didn't even ask him
what he knew.

35:30.170 --> 35:32.172
- He saved my life.
- And he could have killed you.

35:32.172 --> 35:33.632
You walked in there
without assessing the risks,

35:33.632 --> 35:35.300
totally unarmed.

35:35.300 --> 35:36.802
Look, he's got a condition.
What was I supposed to do?

35:36.802 --> 35:39.471
- You are running out of time.
- Yeah, I know that.

35:39.471 --> 35:40.681
<i>Hey, Aster!</i>

35:43.767 --> 35:45.853
Bart, turn off
the audio from the Airlock.

35:45.853 --> 35:47.688
No, let it play.

35:47.688 --> 35:49.731
<i>Aster, are you listening to me?</i>

35:49.731 --> 35:51.108
<i>I remembered something.</i>

35:51.108 --> 35:52.860
I'm listening.

35:52.860 --> 35:55.028
<i>No, you gotta come down here
and talk to me face-to-face.</i>

36:15.841 --> 36:18.343
Whoa!

36:27.561 --> 36:28.437
Well?

36:32.816 --> 36:34.484
You look like you feel better.

36:34.484 --> 36:37.154
Yeah, I guess those prints
must've worked.

36:37.154 --> 36:38.572
Thank you for that.

36:38.572 --> 36:39.865
You said you remembered
something?

36:39.865 --> 36:42.492
- I do.
- And?

36:42.492 --> 36:44.328
Oh, I'm not just gonna tell you.

36:44.328 --> 36:46.872
What happened to the gratitude
you were feeling a minute ago?

36:46.872 --> 36:49.875
Nah. No, I got
a whole list of demands.

36:49.875 --> 36:52.210
Starting with the Picker.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.129
That won't get you past
the debris field.

36:54.129 --> 36:55.589
That's my problem.

36:55.589 --> 36:57.215
Finding Solomon's rocks,
that's your problem,

36:57.215 --> 36:58.842
and I know exactly
how to solve it.

37:02.512 --> 37:04.598
So, we go, we check it out.

37:04.598 --> 37:06.099
If what I tell you
leads you to the rocks,

37:06.099 --> 37:07.809
then you let me go.

37:09.061 --> 37:11.188
Harmony, how much
time do we have?

37:11.188 --> 37:13.357
<i>Latest estimate, 30 hours.</i>

37:17.903 --> 37:19.112
The one time I reached for it,

37:19.112 --> 37:20.364
Solomon didn't want me
to touch it.

37:21.949 --> 37:24.368
<i>Aster, he's wasting your time.</i>

37:24.368 --> 37:26.203
- What does it do?
<i>- It used to open</i>

37:26.203 --> 37:28.956
<i>the maintenance access door
for the microwave antenna.</i>

37:28.956 --> 37:31.458
<i>But the antenna's been
disconnected for 100 years.</i>

37:31.458 --> 37:33.502
The Antenna Silo is external.

37:33.502 --> 37:37.047
<i>Yes, but it can be accessed
inside on the Storage Level.</i>

37:37.047 --> 37:38.924
Sounds like a good
hiding place to me.

37:49.935 --> 37:52.062
Looks like you might be getting
off this beacon pretty soon.

37:55.732 --> 37:58.610
<i>- Aster, may I have a word?</i>
- No.

37:58.610 --> 38:01.488
<i>This is a matter of security.
Allowing Halan to roam freely--</i>

38:01.488 --> 38:03.240
If you calm down, Bart,

38:03.240 --> 38:04.950
I can explain
how things actually work.

38:04.950 --> 38:06.576
<i>The only thing to explain</i>

38:06.576 --> 38:08.870
<i>is when Aster is going to remand
him to the authorities.</i>

38:08.870 --> 38:10.872
Halan will be taken care of,
I can assure you.

38:10.872 --> 38:12.624
<i>She's making deals with him.</i>

38:12.624 --> 38:14.501
<i>That means she's either
stupid or corrupt.</i>

38:14.501 --> 38:18.505
<i>- I demand to know which!</i>
- We do not demand.

38:18.505 --> 38:20.757
And we certainly do not insult.

38:20.757 --> 38:24.052
Our job is to use information
to support and advise.

38:24.052 --> 38:25.470
That's it.

38:25.470 --> 38:28.932
<i>You're right,
I spoke out of turn.</i>

38:28.932 --> 38:30.517
I've defended you, Bart,
because of everything

38:30.517 --> 38:32.144
that you've been through.

38:32.144 --> 38:34.813
But your behavior
is unacceptable.

38:34.813 --> 38:36.148
Run a self-diagnostic.

38:53.665 --> 38:56.918
So... Bart.

38:56.918 --> 39:00.005
Yeah. Bart.

39:00.005 --> 39:02.049
Now you see why I shut off
his permissions.

39:02.049 --> 39:04.092
He'd drive anyone mental.

39:04.092 --> 39:06.636
Makes that Sector 81
seem much more peaceful, huh?

39:06.636 --> 39:08.263
Ninety-one.

39:08.263 --> 39:10.849
Right, my mistake.

39:26.448 --> 39:28.158
Find something?

39:28.158 --> 39:29.910
Aster?

39:29.910 --> 39:31.453
It's not the rocks, is it?

39:34.998 --> 39:36.124
No.

39:48.011 --> 39:49.179
That's gotta be it, right?

39:52.015 --> 39:53.225
You wanna help?

39:53.225 --> 39:54.935
Yeah.

40:09.074 --> 40:10.617
Are you coming?

40:10.617 --> 40:13.078
Yeah.

40:33.765 --> 40:35.267
<i>Sarge?</i>

40:35.267 --> 40:36.476
Halan?

40:56.830 --> 40:58.832
Hey.

40:58.832 --> 41:00.208
Halan, what happened
down there?

41:00.208 --> 41:01.501
No, no, no.

41:01.501 --> 41:02.711
Halan, look at me.

41:05.422 --> 41:06.756
You're safe, all right?

41:08.508 --> 41:09.885
You're safe.

41:12.846 --> 41:14.931
Harmony, print a sedative patch.

41:16.766 --> 41:19.561
I'm sorry.

41:19.561 --> 41:22.981
- What happened?
- There was something there.

41:22.981 --> 41:24.941
It came at me, I saw it.

41:26.401 --> 41:28.820
I couldn't... I...
Did you see anything?

41:28.820 --> 41:30.780
It's possible we gave him
the wrong dosage.

41:30.780 --> 41:32.324
No!

41:32.324 --> 41:34.201
No, it wasn't the pharma,
there was something there!

41:34.201 --> 41:36.870
Halan, there was nothing there.
There was nothing inside.

41:36.870 --> 41:38.455
Sedative patch ready.

41:41.833 --> 41:43.168
I'll come back, okay?

41:56.014 --> 41:57.224
Drink this.

42:01.144 --> 42:02.354
Drink it.

42:08.443 --> 42:09.819
You don't have to go back
in there.

42:12.239 --> 42:14.157
I saw something, Aster.

42:15.659 --> 42:16.910
I swear.

42:19.204 --> 42:21.248
Somebody better find
those rocks, hey?

42:21.248 --> 42:22.832
Or you're not getting off
this beacon.

44:08.438 --> 44:09.856
How you feeling?

44:09.856 --> 44:11.983
You found the rocks,
didn't you?

44:11.983 --> 44:13.610
Yeah.

44:15.779 --> 44:17.072
I guess that's it then.

44:18.698 --> 44:19.991
I'll move out,
clear the perimeter

44:19.991 --> 44:21.242
before your cutter gets here.

44:21.242 --> 44:22.952
All you gotta do
is open the door.

44:22.952 --> 44:24.704
I can't let you go.

44:24.704 --> 44:26.289
We had a deal.

44:26.289 --> 44:28.333
It's better this way,
trust me.

44:28.333 --> 44:30.752
No, trusting you is what
got me here in the first place.

44:30.752 --> 44:32.629
Look, they're not gonna care
that you're AWOL.

44:32.629 --> 44:33.922
It won't matter to them.

44:33.922 --> 44:35.924
This is your best chance,
and mine.

44:37.550 --> 44:39.511
I let you out,
they'll think we made a deal,

44:39.511 --> 44:40.804
that I got a cut.

44:42.889 --> 44:45.225
Then they'll destroy my life.

44:45.225 --> 44:47.185
And they'll come for you,
and it'll be worse.

44:47.185 --> 44:48.937
No one is that scared of ISA.

44:50.397 --> 44:51.356
Who are you?

44:56.569 --> 44:57.946
Bye, Halan.

45:04.869 --> 45:07.622
<i>Even I believed she was
gonna let you go, Halan.</i>

45:07.622 --> 45:10.917
<i>Imagine my joy, seeing her
duplicity revealed.</i>

45:10.917 --> 45:12.836
- Shut up, Bart.
<i>- You'll get no pity from me.</i>

45:12.836 --> 45:14.421
<i>It's your turn to suffer.</i>

45:14.421 --> 45:18.049
<i>And I intend to maximize
every moment of your agony.</i>

45:18.049 --> 45:20.301
- I said shut up, Bart!
<i>- Scream and rage.</i>

45:20.301 --> 45:21.886
<i>No one will hear you.</i>

45:21.886 --> 45:23.388
<i>I've turned off your voice.</i>

45:24.681 --> 45:27.183
<i>You silenced me once.</i>

45:27.183 --> 45:28.768
<i>Let's see how you like it.</i>

46:01.551 --> 46:02.385
- Harm?
- Yeah?

46:03.845 --> 46:05.180
Did you see that?

46:05.180 --> 46:07.015
It... it just disappeared.

46:07.015 --> 46:08.892
I just need to slow down
the element

46:08.892 --> 46:10.643
and figure out what it is.

46:10.643 --> 46:12.103
I could print out
a collisional cooling unit.

46:12.103 --> 46:13.688
This is a major find.

46:26.576 --> 46:27.535
Aster!

46:28.703 --> 46:30.121
Aster!

46:30.121 --> 46:31.873
<i>That debris</i>

46:31.873 --> 46:34.292
<i>should not have been allowed
to get this close to the beacon.</i>

46:47.764 --> 46:49.641
Close the docking bay.
Lock everything down.

47:19.796 --> 47:21.381
They're not coming in.

47:21.381 --> 47:23.299
Bring the drones, open fire.

47:23.299 --> 47:25.426
<i>They've attached too
close to the fusion generator.</i>

47:25.426 --> 47:27.929
<i>If we fire on them,
the beacon will explode.</i>

47:37.480 --> 47:39.190
We're losing pressure
in Airlock One.

47:39.190 --> 47:40.525
They're forcing the doors open.

47:46.906 --> 47:48.700
Contain them
to the lower levels.

47:48.700 --> 47:49.742
What about Halan?

47:52.370 --> 47:53.580
No one comes up.
