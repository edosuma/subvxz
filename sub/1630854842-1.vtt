WEBVTT

00:18.666 --> 00:20.750
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:21.916 --> 00:24.458
I'm gonna test you on the plans
in random order.

00:24.541 --> 00:26.416
Never know which one we'll need and when.

00:26.500 --> 00:30.041
It's vital we can communicate quickly
and clearly in as few words as possible.

00:30.125 --> 00:32.958
Good start. Took you 30 words
to explain what you're about to do.

00:33.041 --> 00:35.875
Don't be facetious, Lucy.
We really don't have time.

00:35.958 --> 00:37.291
Now, what's Plan C?

00:37.375 --> 00:40.250
Plan C means whoever
isn't in combat makes a defensive circle.

00:40.333 --> 00:42.666
Plan E mean you fight the visitor.
I deal with the source.

00:42.750 --> 00:45.500
Plan D is the other way round.
Plan B is salt-bombs.

00:45.583 --> 00:48.708
Plan A is lavender water,
and Plan F is Greek fire,

00:48.791 --> 00:52.333
which should only be used indoors
under carefully controlled circumstances.

00:52.416 --> 00:54.208
-Ten out of ten.
-There were only six.

00:54.291 --> 00:55.916
Damn. I'll have to think of another four.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.958
Thought there wasn't any time
to be facetious.

00:58.041 --> 01:00.458
Well, we're slightly ahead of schedule.

01:03.125 --> 01:06.875
-Are you sure this is the right address?
-62 Sheen Road. Mrs. Hope.

01:06.958 --> 01:09.041
-Quarter to six on the dot.

01:14.125 --> 01:15.000
Ah.

01:15.750 --> 01:17.500
Here she comes.

01:17.583 --> 01:19.291
Are you from the agency?

01:20.291 --> 01:21.166
Mrs. Hope?

01:21.666 --> 01:25.083
I'm Anthony Lockwood.
This is my colleague, Lucy Carlyle.

01:25.166 --> 01:27.583
We've come about your problem.
Care to show us inside?

01:27.666 --> 01:29.541
Oh no, I won't set foot in there.

01:29.625 --> 01:32.958
Not since my husband passed.
Not since… how he passed.

01:33.833 --> 01:36.000
The disturbances
have been very persistent.

01:36.083 --> 01:38.416
I… I'm going to sell it,
but it needs fixing first.

01:38.500 --> 01:40.375
That is exactly what we do.

01:40.458 --> 01:44.750
Locate the visitor, contain the source.
A safe space means a satisfied customer.

01:44.833 --> 01:46.208
Shouldn't you have a supervisor?

01:46.291 --> 01:49.125
I… I thought an adult had to be present
at an investigation.

01:49.208 --> 01:51.083
Strictly speaking, the law states

01:51.166 --> 01:54.458
that an adult's only required
if operatives are undergoing training.

01:54.541 --> 01:56.416
But we don't find it necessary.

01:56.500 --> 01:58.375
To be honest, adults are pretty useless.

02:01.083 --> 02:04.416
'Cause of their lack of sensitivity.
They just get in the way.

02:08.125 --> 02:12.333
One more thing, madam. Is there someone
else inside the house? It's just, we saw--

02:12.416 --> 02:14.208
No. I've got the only key.

02:14.916 --> 02:17.750
Here's the form you sent.
Tells you all you need to know.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.750
Now I have to go. It's almost curfew.

02:25.250 --> 02:29.583
When I was your age,
I was out chasing boys, having fun.

02:30.666 --> 02:32.708
It's terrible the world's come to this.

02:33.208 --> 02:35.166
I feel sorry for your generation.

02:38.375 --> 02:39.750
Cheerful soul.

02:39.833 --> 02:41.208
Real ray of sunshine.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.666
Ready?

02:49.750 --> 02:50.750
Ready.

03:05.416 --> 03:06.375
Heating's off.

03:06.458 --> 03:08.916
Better be. It's freezin'.

03:09.458 --> 03:10.625
Anything else?

03:10.708 --> 03:12.583
Yeah, think so.

03:13.791 --> 03:14.750
Shall we?

03:30.166 --> 03:31.750
-Hear something?
-Yep.

03:32.833 --> 03:34.541
Knocking. Very faint.

03:35.375 --> 03:37.666
Can't tell from where. You?

03:39.208 --> 03:42.000
Death-glow. So bright
I should have brought my sunglasses.

03:48.500 --> 03:52.250
It's not funny.
I heard him falling. Sounded brutal.

03:53.958 --> 03:55.291
It's not even six.

03:56.166 --> 03:57.541
-Tea?
-<i>What does it say?</i>

03:58.625 --> 04:01.875
They moved here.
Everything was fine. No manifestations.

04:02.458 --> 04:05.625
Then, suddenly,
he falls down the stairs and dies.

04:05.708 --> 04:07.875
She thinks he tripped
going to get a glass of water.

04:07.958 --> 04:11.000
-Hmm. Very credible.
-Sarcastic or ironic?

04:11.083 --> 04:12.875
The cleverer one.

04:12.958 --> 04:16.333
-Do you think she pushed him?
-Well, at least that'd be a motive.

04:16.833 --> 04:18.541
Did she describe the apparition?

04:18.625 --> 04:22.708
It says she felt like something was
looking for her, but couldn't find her.

04:22.791 --> 04:25.416
And the thought of it finding her
was more than she could bear.

04:25.500 --> 04:28.291
-So it has a purpose.
-Which suggests a Type Two.

04:30.166 --> 04:31.083
6:30.

04:32.708 --> 04:33.625
Sun's down.

04:35.416 --> 04:37.333
How about we find ourselves a ghost?

04:41.333 --> 04:42.541
Knocking's back.

04:43.291 --> 04:44.500
Getting louder.

04:47.416 --> 04:48.250
It stopped.

04:49.125 --> 04:51.541
Soon as I stepped onto the landing.
So it knows we're here.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.416
-Temperature's dropping.

04:53.500 --> 04:55.583
Right, torch off.
I need to tune in.

04:57.666 --> 04:59.208
Pick a door. Any door.

04:59.708 --> 05:01.666
-Go with the furthest.
-Why?

05:02.416 --> 05:03.916
It's the scariest.

05:11.333 --> 05:13.041
-Office.
-Yeah.

05:14.666 --> 05:15.916
But not always. Look.

05:16.416 --> 05:18.708
Pressure marks. Deep, wide apart.

05:18.791 --> 05:21.166
Perhaps this used to be the bedroom
before the Hopes moved in.

05:22.208 --> 05:26.000
I can feel it. This is where
the source is. Can't… can't you feel it?

05:29.333 --> 05:33.125
Don't let it get to you. Keep active.
Go get the bags. Make a circle.

05:33.625 --> 05:36.125
-I'll check the other rooms.
-Filings or chains?

05:36.708 --> 05:38.541
Oh, filings.

05:38.625 --> 05:40.583
Sure? It's still early,
it's already this strong.

05:40.666 --> 05:42.541
-It's not that strong, plus…
-Plus what?

05:43.125 --> 05:44.541
I forgot to bring the chains.

05:45.125 --> 05:46.500
You forgot to bring the chains?

05:46.583 --> 05:49.916
George took them out to oil them.
I didn't check he'd put them back, so…

05:50.000 --> 05:51.208
it's George's fault.

05:51.291 --> 05:52.375
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

05:52.458 --> 05:55.375
We don't need them for a job like this.
Filings will be just fine.

05:59.541 --> 06:01.875
Bloody amateurs.

06:36.958 --> 06:37.875
Lockwood?

06:39.208 --> 06:41.583
-Lockwood?

06:43.458 --> 06:44.958
Lockwood…

06:45.041 --> 06:46.958
Just a sec.
There's another death-glow.

06:47.041 --> 06:49.291
Something nasty happened here too
a long while back,

06:49.375 --> 06:52.458
which means there might have been
two violent deaths in this house.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.625
Lockwood! It's urgent!

06:56.708 --> 07:00.666
Thing is, I don't see how the first
death's got anything to do with the Hopes,

07:00.750 --> 07:04.583
so perhaps the disturbances
weren't caused by Mr. Hope…

07:04.666 --> 07:07.000
-No. Well done.

07:08.041 --> 07:09.708
-They weren't.
-Ah.

07:10.958 --> 07:13.250
-You got anything from her?
-Haven't tried.

07:13.750 --> 07:15.625
Been busy trying
to make contact with the living.

07:15.708 --> 07:17.875
Why not have a go
before she gets any closer?

07:30.416 --> 07:31.500
She's in pain.

07:31.583 --> 07:34.208
-Of course she is. She's dead.
-No, something's different.

07:34.291 --> 07:36.166
-What's different?
-Ssh!

07:36.833 --> 07:38.333
I can almost…

07:38.916 --> 07:40.625
Let go of me!

07:42.291 --> 07:43.625
Let go of me!

07:45.458 --> 07:46.416
Let go of me.

07:48.416 --> 07:50.791
Let go of me!

07:50.875 --> 07:53.041
Let go of me!

07:53.625 --> 07:55.125
-Lucy!

09:12.291 --> 09:14.541
Tell me about your daughter,
Mrs. Carlyle.

09:15.041 --> 09:18.541
Well, she's always
had talent, ever since she was a baby.

09:19.166 --> 09:21.541
She used to keep us up all night
with her crying.

09:21.625 --> 09:23.375
We thought there was
something wrong with her,

09:23.458 --> 09:26.750
until we realized she was hearing them
in the street outside her window.

09:27.750 --> 09:30.166
-So she's a listener?
-Gifted.

09:30.666 --> 09:33.166
When she was six,
she saw a visitor on the marshes.

09:33.250 --> 09:36.666
Heard it long before she saw it,
or she wouldn't be here with us now.

09:37.291 --> 09:40.791
She does sound special.
And you're in luck. We've a vacancy.

09:41.583 --> 09:45.333
I lost one of my operatives
the day before yesterday, poor lad, but…

09:46.125 --> 09:48.833
he was about her size,
so maybe she could have his old uniform.

09:49.708 --> 09:50.916
Well, that'd be wonderful.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.083
Mrs. Clarke will take care
of the paperwork.

09:53.166 --> 09:54.541
We're ever so grateful.

09:55.958 --> 09:57.916
Aren't you gonna
give me a smile, young lady?

09:59.333 --> 10:02.708
<i>You confirm that the child</i>
<i>is of legal age to be an operative?</i>

10:02.791 --> 10:04.333
Yes, 13 last week.

10:04.416 --> 10:06.166
And has adequate ability
to sense the presence

10:06.250 --> 10:08.083
of Type One and Type Two visitors,

10:08.166 --> 10:09.333
and to defend against them?

10:09.416 --> 10:10.250
Yes.

10:10.791 --> 10:13.250
You understand she'll be exposed
to significant risk

10:13.333 --> 10:16.291
of trauma, injury, and death
whilst carrying out her duties?

10:16.375 --> 10:17.375
Yes.

10:17.458 --> 10:20.666
And that beyond completion of training
and issuance of protective equipment,

10:20.750 --> 10:23.583
it's her responsibility
to safeguard herself at all times?

10:23.666 --> 10:24.500
Yes.

10:24.583 --> 10:27.166
Payment will be made
on the last Friday of each month.

10:27.250 --> 10:29.333
-Into whose account?
-Mine.

10:33.750 --> 10:37.000
I don't want to do it. It scares me.
I don't want to be scared all the time!

10:37.083 --> 10:39.708
Everyone's scared all the time.
What makes you so special?

10:39.791 --> 10:42.208
I'll get a job somewhere else.
Anywhere else.

10:42.291 --> 10:44.500
I just want to stay in school.
I want to be normal.

10:46.666 --> 10:47.833
Listen to me, young lady.

10:47.916 --> 10:51.375
Your father left us with nothing
when he drank himself to death,

10:51.458 --> 10:53.166
so you'll go in there Monday morning,

10:53.250 --> 10:56.458
and smile and charm
and work hard and be grateful,

10:56.541 --> 11:00.416
or so help me God, I will show you
what being scared really feels like.

11:06.958 --> 11:10.541
Ladies and gents, this is Lucy Carlyle.
She's a listener.

11:11.500 --> 11:14.125
Mother says she's gifted,
but we'll be the judge of that.

11:14.208 --> 11:16.875
Norrie, look after her,
show her the ropes.

11:20.125 --> 11:23.583
Careful. Don't get any on you.
It's deadly poisonous.

11:24.083 --> 11:26.250
Poisonous
and extremely expensive.

11:26.833 --> 11:29.083
Any you spill comes out of your wages.

11:31.916 --> 11:33.458
That's the explosive?

11:33.958 --> 11:36.250
Sand, salt and silver fulminate.

11:37.041 --> 11:38.333
Reacts with their plasm.

11:38.833 --> 11:42.791
Remember, iron forms a barrier
between you and a ghost.

11:42.875 --> 11:46.041
The stronger the ghost,
the stronger your barrier must be.

11:46.541 --> 11:49.833
Type Ones are weaker.
Type Twos are more powerful.

11:50.625 --> 11:52.291
Never show them your fear.

11:52.958 --> 11:55.291
Know why he carries that silver flask
all the time?

11:55.791 --> 11:56.625
No.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.916
'Cause it's the only way
he'll ever trap any spirits.

12:01.875 --> 12:04.291
-You know why he's so pale?
-No.

12:04.916 --> 12:07.041
He gets the shit scared out of him
three times a night.

12:09.333 --> 12:11.125
You know why he's called Jacobs?

12:11.208 --> 12:12.208
No.

12:12.291 --> 12:14.333
-'Cause he's fricking crackers.

12:15.833 --> 12:18.791
Swan Hotel. Top floor corridor.

12:18.875 --> 12:23.875
No one will take any of the rooms because
of strange and unpleasant sensations.

12:23.958 --> 12:26.500
Find the spirit and neutralize it.

12:35.708 --> 12:37.166
What is it, Luce?

12:37.250 --> 12:38.916
-Can you hear somethin'?

12:47.208 --> 12:49.125
It's here.

12:51.916 --> 12:54.208
-It's coming. Behind us!
-What?

12:54.291 --> 12:56.750
-What are you doing?
-Listen to her, Paul.

12:56.833 --> 12:58.333
She knows what she's doin'.

13:04.416 --> 13:07.125
-What's your name again?
-Lucy Carlyle.

13:07.208 --> 13:09.250
Nice work tonight, Lucy Carlyle.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.166
Your rapier is
your most vital piece of kit.

13:16.250 --> 13:19.541
Its iron blade wards away the specters.

13:20.083 --> 13:21.125
Disperses them.

13:21.916 --> 13:25.291
The more proficient you become,
the longer you'll live.

13:35.666 --> 13:37.791
-Norrie!

13:37.875 --> 13:39.958
-Lucy! Help!

13:40.541 --> 13:44.083
In recognition
of two years at Jacobs & Co.

13:44.166 --> 13:45.916
and achieving third grade,

13:46.000 --> 13:49.250
her own rapier
and copy of the Fittes Manual.

13:49.833 --> 13:52.166
A true asset to the agency…

13:52.791 --> 13:54.375
Lucy Carlyle.

14:00.916 --> 14:03.416
Why couldn't I have been
born a Fittes?

14:04.083 --> 14:07.791
Why wasn't I called somethin' fancy,
like Penelope or Marissa?

14:08.666 --> 14:11.458
Whoever heard of anyone
rich and famous called Norrie?

14:11.541 --> 14:13.666
She's got a cupboard full.
She'll never notice.

14:16.041 --> 14:18.916
Oh God. Maybe this is how it starts.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.416
How what starts?

14:20.500 --> 14:22.333
How you end up like Jacobs,

14:22.833 --> 14:25.333
or any of the other sad sack adults
in this shitty town.

14:25.416 --> 14:29.375
-Drinking whisky at four in the afternoon?
-Ahh! It's just a sip. To celebrate.

14:29.458 --> 14:34.333
No! We can't work for Jacobs
till our talent fades.

14:35.041 --> 14:37.541
We can't let our parents
piss our money up the wall.

14:38.416 --> 14:40.583
Let's go to London. Tonight.

14:41.541 --> 14:44.750
Get interviews at Fittes and Rotwell.
Make something out of ourselves

14:44.833 --> 14:47.750
before our names end up
on that giant gravestone in the square.

14:47.833 --> 14:48.708
I can't.

14:48.791 --> 14:50.333
I haven't passed fourth grade yet.

14:50.416 --> 14:52.416
They'd send me back
or put me on night watch.

14:52.500 --> 14:55.750
So we fake the letters
or bullshit our way in.

14:55.833 --> 14:57.958
It's the talent that counts,
not bits of paper.

14:58.041 --> 15:00.958
Yeah, then wait,
until I'm fully qualified.

15:01.041 --> 15:03.166
It's not long. Just next year,

15:03.250 --> 15:06.541
and… then I don't need
anyone's permission.

15:06.625 --> 15:10.625
And we'll meet with all the big agencies.
There'll be a bidding war to sign us up.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.333
And in a couple of years, we'll be
the most famous agents in the country.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.416
We'll be on the cover of every magazine.

15:18.916 --> 15:21.166
The ghost of Marissa Fittes
will come back from the dead

15:21.250 --> 15:23.416
and drag her raggedy arse
out of her coffin

15:23.500 --> 15:26.041
-and beg us to sign up with her.
-She'll beg!

15:36.125 --> 15:38.291
Your solemn and binding promise.

15:47.500 --> 15:50.208
My solemn and binding promise.

15:57.541 --> 15:59.583
Right, Moorgate Mill.

16:01.333 --> 16:04.750
Logging company wants to clear it
and sell it on to a developer.

16:05.250 --> 16:09.666
Records of visitations are vague,
but everything points to a Type One.

16:13.041 --> 16:14.166
Mr. Jacobs?

16:14.666 --> 16:16.708
Is it true you met Marissa Fittes?

16:17.833 --> 16:20.291
I trained at Fittes in London
while she was alive.

16:20.791 --> 16:23.291
She came to watch us
during sword practice.

16:23.916 --> 16:25.000
What was she like?

16:25.833 --> 16:28.500
Magnificent. Before she and Rotwell

16:28.583 --> 16:31.833
discovered the link between visitors
and sources, it was chaos.

16:31.916 --> 16:34.583
Riots in the streets,
scores killed every day.

16:35.333 --> 16:36.708
She changed everything.

16:37.416 --> 16:40.583
The only person ever to hold
an actual conversation with a Type Three.

16:41.083 --> 16:44.708
So when you say you met her, you mean
you were briefly in the same room as her?

16:45.708 --> 16:47.666
It's closer than you'll ever be.

16:49.541 --> 16:50.625
Closer to history.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.833
Right. 'Cause it all started from nowhere,

16:57.416 --> 16:59.791
then Fittes and Rotwell
magically appeared.

17:00.791 --> 17:02.375
All a bit convenient, isn't it?

17:02.458 --> 17:05.541
-Here we go, Mr. Conspiracies.
-What do you believe, then?

17:05.625 --> 17:08.000
We don't know
the real story about the Problem.

17:09.041 --> 17:10.500
So clever and handsome.

17:11.166 --> 17:13.791
-Such a radical thinker, isn't he, Lucy?
-Hmm!

17:18.291 --> 17:24.166
Find the visitor, locate the source,
contain it and get out.

17:25.500 --> 17:27.125
I don't wanna be here all night.

17:42.583 --> 17:45.083
-Anyone gettin' anything?
-Nothin' yet.

17:45.583 --> 17:49.500
But it's absolutely freezin',
and I do not like what that's tellin' us.

17:58.916 --> 18:00.000
It sounds like a child.

18:01.041 --> 18:02.041
Down there.

18:11.208 --> 18:12.125
Something's wrong.

18:13.208 --> 18:15.708
-I don't think that's a Type One.

18:17.083 --> 18:19.333
We'll follow it. You report to Jacobs.

18:19.416 --> 18:21.958
No. We should all leave,
get more equipment,

18:22.041 --> 18:23.708
make a plan, then come back.

18:23.791 --> 18:26.416
If we leave, we'll lose it.
Go, Lucy, please.

18:29.208 --> 18:32.708
Everyone else, come with me. Stay close.

18:34.125 --> 18:35.500
Be careful, Norrie.

18:50.083 --> 18:52.625
We found something.

18:52.708 --> 18:54.375
Gah!

18:54.458 --> 18:57.166
I thought it was a phantasm
or shadow child at first.

18:57.833 --> 18:59.875
Now I'm not so sure. I think…

19:00.625 --> 19:04.000
-I think you should get everyone out.
-Because you're not so sure?

19:05.375 --> 19:09.666
-I need more. What's your evidence?
-It's nothing clear. Just… just a feeling.

19:09.750 --> 19:11.375
We don't make decisions based on feelings.

19:11.458 --> 19:14.041
Maybe you could come in too?
See what you think?

19:14.125 --> 19:15.250
Just do your job.

19:18.416 --> 19:19.375
Oh God.

19:23.583 --> 19:25.125
-What is that?
-Too close!

19:25.208 --> 19:26.666
It's coming through! Aah!

19:26.750 --> 19:27.583
Someone!

19:28.458 --> 19:29.458
-Quickly!

19:29.541 --> 19:30.375
Norrie!

19:32.291 --> 19:34.458
-Norrie, move!

19:38.125 --> 19:39.916
I need some chains now!

19:41.375 --> 19:44.916
Lucy, Norrie, close the door!
Save yourselves!

19:52.708 --> 19:53.583
Norrie!

19:54.625 --> 19:56.291
-Norrie, no, no!

19:56.375 --> 19:58.041
Norrie! Norrie!

19:58.541 --> 20:01.125
Sir! Sir, please!

20:01.208 --> 20:02.708
She's ghost locked!

20:02.791 --> 20:05.416
Sir, please, we need your help! Sir, sir!

20:05.916 --> 20:08.458
-No, sir! Sir!

20:08.541 --> 20:09.916
They're dying!

20:10.458 --> 20:11.291
Norrie!

20:11.833 --> 20:12.833
Sir, no!

20:13.541 --> 20:15.458
No, no! Sir!

20:15.541 --> 20:17.333
<i>I acted entirely in accordance</i>

20:17.416 --> 20:19.875
<i>with the information</i>
<i>Miss Carlyle brought to me.</i>

20:20.458 --> 20:22.500
It's a pity she wasn't more forthright.

20:23.125 --> 20:25.500
Many young lives might have been spared.

20:26.041 --> 20:28.291
And you heard no cries for help,

20:28.375 --> 20:30.583
nor any indication of a disturbance,

20:30.666 --> 20:32.708
until Miss Carlyle
emerged from the building

20:32.791 --> 20:34.416
and there was no more that could be done?

20:34.500 --> 20:36.708
-None whatsoever.
-That's not true.

20:36.791 --> 20:38.666
You were standing in the doorway.
I saw you.

20:38.750 --> 20:41.708
-I was screaming right at you!
-Quiet, please!

20:41.791 --> 20:44.375
You'll speak only when you're spoken to.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.416
In the cases of the fatal ghost touch

20:49.500 --> 20:55.125
of Alfie Morgan, Joy Young,
Paul Bell, and Abraham Kosta,

20:55.208 --> 20:58.125
I hereby rule death by misadventure.

20:58.916 --> 21:01.333
Their parents will receive due relief

21:01.416 --> 21:03.958
from the Fittes Fund
for Bereaved Families.

21:05.250 --> 21:06.083
Well done.

21:06.166 --> 21:10.166
In the case of persistent morbid
ghost lock suffered by Norrie White,

21:10.791 --> 21:12.750
I will recommend her for subsidy

21:12.833 --> 21:17.208
by the Department for Psychical Research
and Control's Veteran Support Fund.

21:18.458 --> 21:20.083
Will she ever wake up?

21:20.583 --> 21:22.000
Will she ever come back?

21:22.583 --> 21:24.791
The best we can do
is keep her comfortable.

21:28.333 --> 21:31.041
Look at me.
Look at me, young lady.

21:33.083 --> 21:35.583
I'm not having you moping round here
all day and night.

21:35.666 --> 21:38.041
And I'm not spending the rest of my days
getting dirty looks

21:38.125 --> 21:41.083
because I am the mother of the girl
who caused those kids to die.

21:41.583 --> 21:44.625
First thing tomorrow, I am taking you
to Jacobs, and you'll apologize.

21:44.708 --> 21:46.916
You'll admit you're to blame
and ask him to take you back.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.541
If he doesn't, you will beg until he does.
Do you understand?

21:50.625 --> 21:51.500
Yes.

21:53.875 --> 21:56.000
I understand that you don't care about me.

21:56.500 --> 21:57.500
Or Norrie.

21:58.416 --> 21:59.500
Or the truth.

22:00.625 --> 22:02.833
She was my best friend.

22:03.333 --> 22:06.625
We were a family. You think
I'd ever do anything to hurt any of them?

22:06.708 --> 22:08.250
-That's enough.
-No, it's not.

22:09.250 --> 22:13.458
All my life, you treated me
like I was nothing,

22:13.541 --> 22:15.333
till I could make you a bit of money.

22:17.041 --> 22:18.208
All I wanted

22:19.250 --> 22:21.416
is for you to love me.

22:22.958 --> 22:24.166
But you're incapable.

22:24.666 --> 22:27.791
You can't feel anything.
You are deader than dead.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.666
He's expecting us at nine.

23:15.375 --> 23:16.625
Excuse me.

23:17.208 --> 23:19.916
Excuse me.
Is this your first time in London?

23:20.000 --> 23:22.291
It can be dangerous here,
especially at night.

23:22.375 --> 23:25.416
If you need somewhere safe,
come to one of our centers.

23:25.500 --> 23:27.750
No, thanks. I'm… I'm fine, thanks.

23:51.083 --> 23:53.375
<i>…forms to the desks</i>
<i>on the lower level</i>

23:53.458 --> 23:55.958
<i>and report for interview and processing.</i>

24:25.791 --> 24:28.083
ID, references,
and parental permission, please.

24:28.166 --> 24:30.208
I'm sorry, I don't have any of those,

24:30.291 --> 24:34.083
but I do have my grades one to three
certificates, with special commendation.

24:34.166 --> 24:36.125
No paperwork, no processing.

24:36.208 --> 24:39.791
-Please. I've been waiting over an hour.
-I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do.

24:39.875 --> 24:43.333
If I could just talk to someone,
tell them about my talent,

24:43.416 --> 24:45.541
I promise I won't be wasting your time.

24:45.625 --> 24:48.333
It's your own time you're wasting.
Next time, bring your parents.

24:48.416 --> 24:52.750
Please. I've come hundreds of miles,
and I have nowhere to sleep tonight.

24:52.833 --> 24:54.541
Just give me ten minutes to explain.

24:54.625 --> 24:58.625
You think you're the first person to knock
on this door with that story? Move along.

25:05.541 --> 25:07.750
-Thank you. Lovely.
-Not at all.

26:14.541 --> 26:16.083
Are you Arif's new girl?

26:16.833 --> 26:17.791
Who's Arif?

26:17.875 --> 26:20.333
Runs the corner shop,
usually sends round donuts about now.

26:20.416 --> 26:23.000
But you don't have any donuts,
so you'll be another candidate.

26:23.083 --> 26:25.583
I thought we'd finished. Name?

26:25.666 --> 26:28.416
Lucy Carlyle. Are you Mr. Lockwood?

26:28.500 --> 26:29.625
Me? No.

26:30.916 --> 26:34.041
-Uh-- Well, can I see him, then?
-Don't see why not.

26:34.625 --> 26:37.666
The last one's just gone in, but from
the looks of her, she won't be long.

26:40.750 --> 26:43.916
Okay, take a look at this.
Tell me what you think it is.

26:44.500 --> 26:46.750
Oh my God! Get that away from me!

26:51.708 --> 26:55.083
See? Told you so.
Okey-dokey, if you'd like to follow me?

26:59.125 --> 27:00.833
You win. There was one more.

27:00.916 --> 27:03.791
No, you win. I checked the list.
That was the last one.

27:03.875 --> 27:05.708
Then who's this?

27:12.500 --> 27:14.166
Hello. I'm Anthony Lockwood.

27:14.708 --> 27:17.041
I'm Lucy Carlyle.
I don't have an appointment,

27:17.125 --> 27:20.041
but I saw your advert in the paper,
and I was in the area.

27:20.125 --> 27:21.500
You've heard of us?

27:21.583 --> 27:22.416
No.

27:24.333 --> 27:25.208
My CV.

27:27.291 --> 27:29.750
Would you like some tea?
Or has George already offered?

27:29.833 --> 27:33.208
I thought I'd wait until after
the first test, see if she's still here.

27:33.291 --> 27:34.916
We've wasted enough tea bags today.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.375
Let's give her the benefit of the doubt
and pop the kettle on.

27:38.875 --> 27:41.000
All right, but I reckon she's a bolter.

27:43.541 --> 27:44.666
Sorry about him.

27:45.416 --> 27:48.541
He gets very tetchy
when he's hungry. Take a seat.

27:57.291 --> 28:01.125
So you've got the sight and the touch,
but primarily, you're a listener.

28:01.208 --> 28:05.000
Hmm. I've got good touch,
but it sometimes merges with what I hear.

28:05.083 --> 28:07.000
Touch sometimes triggers the sounds.

28:07.083 --> 28:10.291
George can do a bit of that.
Not me. Sight's my thing.

28:10.791 --> 28:14.208
Death-glows, trails,
all the ghoulish residues of death.

28:15.458 --> 28:19.000
It says here you trained up north
with a local operative named Jacobs.

28:19.083 --> 28:21.916
-Got your grades one to four, I presume?
-Hmm. That's right.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.125
-Did he give you a reference?
-No.

28:25.125 --> 28:28.375
My last employment ended… uh… abruptly.

28:30.625 --> 28:32.708
I could tell you the whole story
if you want,

28:32.791 --> 28:35.208
but it's just not something
I like dwelling on.

28:35.291 --> 28:36.458
Some other time, then.

28:36.541 --> 28:37.666
-Hmm.

28:38.291 --> 28:39.833
Ah! Finally.

28:40.666 --> 28:43.166
-Shall we get on with the tests?
-What tests?

28:43.250 --> 28:44.958
The advert didn't say
anything about tests.

28:45.041 --> 28:48.875
Well, frankly, I don't set much store
by references or referrals.

28:48.958 --> 28:51.000
I prefer to see talent with my own eyes.

28:52.625 --> 28:55.750
Please, take a biscuit.
George will only eat them all.

29:11.375 --> 29:12.375
Now, then.

29:13.250 --> 29:14.416
What do you think…

29:15.708 --> 29:16.666
this is?

29:18.000 --> 29:22.750
Uh… It's silver-glass,
made by the Sunrise Corporation.

29:32.583 --> 29:34.083
Um… um…

29:34.625 --> 29:36.250
Ahem. It's… it's a ghost-jar.

29:36.791 --> 29:39.375
The skull's the source,
and the ghost is tied to it.

29:40.083 --> 29:43.125
Couldn't tell you what sort.
Phantom or a specter, maybe?

29:43.208 --> 29:45.166
That's right. Well done.

29:46.208 --> 29:48.583
She was shaken. You could see it.

29:49.291 --> 29:51.750
You know I can hear you
when you say things like that?

29:53.333 --> 29:55.750
Where did you get it?
Only Fittes and Rotwell had them.

29:55.833 --> 30:00.500
Time for questions later.
Now, tell me, what do you think of this?

30:10.125 --> 30:12.750
-I can hear… gunshots.

30:12.833 --> 30:14.791
-Gunshots?
-Sounds nasty.

30:14.875 --> 30:19.083
No. They're not violent or sad.
There's no suffering.

30:19.166 --> 30:20.458
-This…

30:20.958 --> 30:22.250
This belonged to someone…

30:24.000 --> 30:26.166
happy, gentle.

30:26.250 --> 30:30.416
Very good. My uncle.
Used to take it with him on hunting trips.

30:31.208 --> 30:33.875
Even had it with him
when he keeled over from a stroke.

30:33.958 --> 30:35.541
He was a nice bloke. Shame.

30:37.500 --> 30:39.291
How about… this?

30:51.291 --> 30:55.708
There's death attached to this.
A lot of death. It's vile.

30:57.166 --> 31:00.458
I don't know what this is or where
you got it, but nobody should hold it.

31:01.125 --> 31:04.083
Certainly not in the context
of a job interview.

31:04.166 --> 31:06.791
It's a memento
of my first successful case.

31:07.833 --> 31:10.208
-Heard of the mass murderer Harold Beck?
-No.

31:10.708 --> 31:12.958
And I don't think I want to,
thanks very much.

31:13.041 --> 31:15.791
That's very sensible. Horrible business.

31:17.041 --> 31:19.791
Now, finally, give this a go.

31:34.791 --> 31:36.708
I… I can't sense anything.

31:37.291 --> 31:39.166
Really? Are you sure?

31:39.708 --> 31:41.250
Try a little harder, why don't you?

31:46.750 --> 31:49.333
No, I'm positive. Nothing.

31:51.750 --> 31:52.916
I should hope not.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.416
-That's George's toothbrush cup.

31:59.416 --> 32:01.875
I didn't come here to be made fun of.

32:06.458 --> 32:09.666
I don't know
what kind of so-called agency this is,

32:10.625 --> 32:13.041
but as far as I can see,
it's about as prestigious

32:13.125 --> 32:16.500
as a couple of pathetic schoolboys playing
agents before their parents get home.

32:18.666 --> 32:19.875
I'll see myself out.

32:19.958 --> 32:21.625
Feisty.

32:23.125 --> 32:26.708
Step over here,
and I will show you how feisty I am.

32:26.791 --> 32:28.750
-Maybe I will.
-I don't see you moving.

32:29.458 --> 32:32.125
This is a deep armchair.
Takes a while to get up.

32:32.208 --> 32:33.500
-Oh.

32:34.291 --> 32:35.250
I'll wait.

32:39.250 --> 32:42.041
Miss Carlyle,
I apologize for upsetting you,

32:42.125 --> 32:44.500
but I assure you
this is a genuine enterprise,

32:44.583 --> 32:46.375
and that was a serious test.

32:46.916 --> 32:48.625
Which you passed with flying colors.

32:49.250 --> 32:53.250
You'd be amazed how many candidates
make up some cock-and-bull story.

32:53.333 --> 32:56.958
It'd be the most haunted cup in London
if the mildest of their tales were true.

32:58.125 --> 33:00.541
-Tell her about the biscuit rule.
-What?

33:01.125 --> 33:03.125
She can't go
taking two at once like that.

33:03.208 --> 33:07.583
Each member of the agency can only take
one biscuit at a time in strict rotation.

33:08.166 --> 33:09.416
Keeps things fair.

33:09.500 --> 33:11.458
Ea… Each member of the agency?

33:11.958 --> 33:14.416
Assuming you are still interested
in the position?

33:16.708 --> 33:17.541
Yes.

33:18.625 --> 33:19.875
I'm interested.

33:19.958 --> 33:22.875
Excellent. How about I give you
a tour of the house?

33:24.041 --> 33:27.250
I can understand why you might think
our setup's a little unusual.

33:27.333 --> 33:29.583
We're a new agency,
been registered three months.

33:29.666 --> 33:31.166
We're accredited with DEPRAC,

33:31.250 --> 33:34.083
but we're not on their payroll
like Fittes or Rotwell.

33:34.166 --> 33:36.250
We're independent,
and we like it that way.

33:36.750 --> 33:38.458
Who are your supervisors?

33:38.541 --> 33:39.791
No supervisors here.

33:39.875 --> 33:43.375
No adults. It's my company,
hence the name. That bother you?

33:43.875 --> 33:45.750
Uh… Sounds all right.

33:45.833 --> 33:47.958
Bathroom, my room, George's room.

33:48.583 --> 33:52.791
Wouldn't go in without knocking. Walked in
on him doing yoga once, totally naked.

33:52.875 --> 33:54.958
-Got quite an unusual view.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.250
Huh? What about that room?

33:58.333 --> 33:59.791
That's private.

34:00.833 --> 34:04.166
Nothing very interesting.
Follow me, lots more to see.

34:05.000 --> 34:11.041
The library is through there,
but this is the most important room.

34:13.541 --> 34:15.000
We call this the thinking cloth.

34:15.083 --> 34:17.250
We jot down memos,
theories, trains of thought.

34:17.333 --> 34:18.500
It's a very useful tool.

34:18.583 --> 34:20.791
I located the bones
of the Fenchurch Street Ghoul

34:20.875 --> 34:22.666
by sketching out the street plans here

34:22.750 --> 34:24.708
at three in the morning
over cheese on toast.

34:25.375 --> 34:27.958
When a case goes badly
and we're not talking to each other,

34:28.041 --> 34:29.500
it's good for exchanging insults too.

34:29.583 --> 34:32.041
-Ah. How often does that happen?
-Almost never.

34:33.583 --> 34:34.708
-Now…

34:36.625 --> 34:38.416
The basement. Follow me.

34:41.291 --> 34:42.958
Offices. Case files.

34:43.041 --> 34:45.500
George is obsessed
with the history of the Problem.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.166
He's a fastidious record keeper.

34:47.250 --> 34:49.958
It's a good thing, too.
I get brain-ache writing a shopping list.

34:50.041 --> 34:50.875
Training room.

34:50.958 --> 34:54.541
Randomized smoke jets simulating
a variety of attack and defense patterns.

34:56.208 --> 34:58.625
George came up with it.
Every now and then, it actually works.

34:58.708 --> 35:02.708
You'll be proficient with a sword already
as you've passed your fourth grade.

35:02.791 --> 35:03.625
Of course.

35:04.458 --> 35:07.666
Now, finally, our high-security storeroom.

35:11.375 --> 35:12.541
It's unlocked.

35:15.791 --> 35:16.708
Note to self.

35:17.583 --> 35:19.833
Heighten security
on high-security storeroom.

35:28.416 --> 35:29.250
Wow.

35:31.791 --> 35:33.458
You never know what's coming.

35:34.875 --> 35:37.625
You still haven't told me
where you got that haunted skull.

35:37.708 --> 35:39.958
It's George's.
He likes to experiment on it.

35:40.041 --> 35:42.250
See how it responds to different stimuli.

35:42.333 --> 35:43.875
You still haven't told me.

35:45.500 --> 35:46.333
He stole it.

35:47.750 --> 35:49.583
Come on. I'll show you the attic.

35:52.541 --> 35:55.958
This is where I slept when I was little.
You can use it, if you like.

35:56.458 --> 35:58.708
-Unless you've other arrangements?
-Yes.

35:59.375 --> 36:02.500
-No. I mean--
-We'd deduct the rent from your wages.

36:02.583 --> 36:06.541
Nothing too steep, just enough to cover
the bills. I'm a very reliable landlord.

36:16.708 --> 36:19.958
It's, uh… got its own bathroom.
There's a bigger one downstairs,

36:20.041 --> 36:23.041
but that'd mean sharing with George,
and I wouldn't wish that on anyone.

36:26.583 --> 36:29.958
Right, well, I'll leave you to unpack.
Settle in.

36:31.166 --> 36:33.583
-That's assuming--
-Those newspaper clippings on the wall…

36:33.666 --> 36:35.583
Oh! You saw those.

36:36.500 --> 36:38.958
Not very modest, is it?
Should really take them down.

36:39.041 --> 36:40.416
No, it's more… It's just…

36:40.916 --> 36:43.458
Well, it's just,
you haven't said anything about…

36:43.541 --> 36:46.000
I mean, who are you?

36:46.625 --> 36:50.000
Plenty of time for that.
You should rest. Get some sleep.

36:51.291 --> 36:53.625
That's… if you'll take the job?

36:54.791 --> 36:55.625
Yes.

36:57.625 --> 37:00.291
Well, then, welcome to Lockwood & Co.

38:12.291 --> 38:13.791
-I know what you're thinking.

38:16.416 --> 38:17.458
But it's forbidden.

38:18.500 --> 38:21.250
-Oh. The door?
-Yeah, the door.

38:21.333 --> 38:24.625
-I was gonna get a glass of water.
-You'll have more luck in the kitchen.

38:26.041 --> 38:28.166
-Why does he keep it shut?
-I've no idea.

38:28.916 --> 38:30.708
-How long have you lived here?
-About a year.

38:30.791 --> 38:32.875
-Oh, so you know him pretty well?
-Well enough.

38:32.958 --> 38:37.083
'Cause… I'm just wondering
about the house. How he came to live here.

38:37.166 --> 38:39.750
-I'm guessing it belonged to his--
-To his parents?

38:39.833 --> 38:42.583
Ask him yourself. He's usually
in the library at this time of night.

38:42.666 --> 38:45.166
He'll be less desperate
for the lavatory than I am now.

38:45.750 --> 38:47.291
So if you'd excuse me.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
Hello.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.541
Oh. Hello.

39:13.250 --> 39:16.625
Sorry, am I interrupting?
Only, I'm not tired, so…

39:17.166 --> 39:20.500
No. No, not at all. Come in, sit down.

39:42.583 --> 39:43.500
What are you readin'?

39:46.500 --> 39:48.791
Just keeping up
with what's going on in town.

39:49.375 --> 39:51.416
Parties, that kind of nonsense.

39:51.500 --> 39:53.791
You'd think there'd be less of them
since the Problem,

39:53.875 --> 39:56.375
but for the rich, it's quite the opposite.

39:57.041 --> 39:59.750
Nothing they like more
than to lock themselves in a posh hotel

39:59.833 --> 40:03.750
and thrill with horror at the thought
of all the visitors lurking outside.

40:05.041 --> 40:06.583
DEPRAC held one last week.

40:07.666 --> 40:09.333
Everyone who's anyone was there.

40:09.416 --> 40:11.375
Were you there? Can I see your picture?

40:12.000 --> 40:14.458
No. So… no.

40:18.791 --> 40:21.791
When your advert said
that this is a prestigious agency,

40:22.625 --> 40:24.541
it's not strictly true, is it?

40:25.041 --> 40:26.541
You've only been working three months.

40:26.625 --> 40:28.375
I read the papers
and I've never heard of you.

40:29.333 --> 40:30.625
Mild exaggeration.

40:31.583 --> 40:33.166
Lots of people make them.

40:33.250 --> 40:36.125
Like you, when you told me
you'd passed your fourth grade.

40:37.125 --> 40:38.375
I called DEPRAC.

40:41.500 --> 40:44.750
I'm sorry. Look, I… I am good enough.
I promise.

40:44.833 --> 40:48.041
It's just… the way things ended
with my last agency was--

40:48.125 --> 40:51.958
Whatever happened then is in the past.
What counts is the future.

40:52.958 --> 40:56.291
I know you're good enough to be here.
I saw it with my own eyes.

40:57.083 --> 41:00.750
And trust me, we might be a new outfit
and a little unorthodox,

41:00.833 --> 41:05.208
but one day, this will be one
of the most successful agencies in London.

41:05.875 --> 41:07.791
And I want you to be part of it.

41:07.875 --> 41:09.000
Thank you.

41:10.041 --> 41:10.958
Uh…

41:11.041 --> 41:12.916
Th… there is just one other thing.

41:13.000 --> 41:13.833
Name it.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.791
You've said I'm good enough for you.
You've seen what I can do, but…

41:20.791 --> 41:23.166
how do I know you're good enough for me?

41:25.583 --> 41:26.750
<i>Let go of me!</i>

41:35.541 --> 41:36.625
Lucy!

41:39.625 --> 41:40.750
Lockwood!

41:45.666 --> 41:47.125
-Please!
Hold on, Lucy!

41:47.208 --> 41:48.208
I'm gonna fall!

41:54.000 --> 41:55.875
My foot's caught!

42:09.666 --> 42:11.000
I'm slipping!

42:12.875 --> 42:14.458
Lockwood!

42:20.791 --> 42:22.000
Lucy!

42:25.916 --> 42:28.916
-Did it touch you?
-Course not. I'd be dead.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.666
Lucy, if you don't feel steady,
we should just go home now.

42:31.750 --> 42:34.458
No, I'm fine. It's just…

42:35.041 --> 42:36.041
Just what?

42:37.083 --> 42:40.083
When I connected with her,
it was different.

42:40.166 --> 42:42.583
-What do you mean?
-I saw how she used to be.

42:42.666 --> 42:45.958
More than that. It was like I--
I could feel what she was feeling.

42:46.041 --> 42:48.083
She's a ghost. Ghosts don't have feelings.

42:48.166 --> 42:51.291
No, trust me. This was like
nothing I have ever felt before.

42:51.375 --> 42:52.583
You need to calm down.

42:52.666 --> 42:55.041
-You need to listen to me.
-The parameters have changed.

42:55.125 --> 42:57.250
This is not just
an old couple's argument anymore.

42:57.333 --> 43:01.000
It's the ghost of a murder victim,
and she's gonna be back any second,

43:01.083 --> 43:03.583
so if your head's not in the right place…

43:03.666 --> 43:05.791
Show me where she went.

43:09.125 --> 43:11.875
She faded before she reached the wall,
but that's where she was headed.

43:11.958 --> 43:14.041
Chimney breast.
Probably where the body is.

43:26.375 --> 43:30.000
-This wall's been replastered.
-Oh, careful. You broke the circle.

43:31.583 --> 43:32.750
Oops.

43:44.750 --> 43:46.291
She's back.

43:48.250 --> 43:51.375
Boring. You've done that already.
Try something new, why don't you?

43:51.458 --> 43:54.708
Don't taunt her, Lockwood. She's angry.

43:56.791 --> 43:58.833
-Nearly there.
-Hurry up.

43:59.750 --> 44:00.791
Here it comes.

44:03.291 --> 44:04.500
-Oh!

44:04.583 --> 44:05.583
My sword!

44:08.750 --> 44:09.833
Lockwood!

44:14.291 --> 44:15.291
Lockwood!

44:24.791 --> 44:26.208
This is not good.

44:26.708 --> 44:28.791
-That's her.
-The body's the source.

44:28.875 --> 44:30.750
I'll hold her back.
You get a silver net over it.

44:31.750 --> 44:33.291
In other words, Plan F.

44:33.375 --> 44:34.833
That's not Plan F.

44:34.916 --> 44:35.958
Uh, I… I mean, Plan B.

44:36.041 --> 44:37.958
Plan B's salt-bombs.
She's too strong for that.

44:38.041 --> 44:40.333
For God's sake. I'll draw her off.
You contain the source.

44:40.416 --> 44:41.458
That's Plan E!

44:41.541 --> 44:44.583
When this is over, we need
to totally rework the lettering system.

44:44.666 --> 44:45.625
Speak for yourself.

44:55.750 --> 44:57.208
Let go of me!

45:03.500 --> 45:05.333
-Lucy, behind you!

45:11.833 --> 45:13.291
Lucy, hurry!

45:18.250 --> 45:19.250
Lucy!

45:33.125 --> 45:34.291
Are you okay?

45:34.375 --> 45:37.541
Apart from our client's house
burning to the ground, absolutely fine.

45:39.916 --> 45:41.041
-What--

45:41.708 --> 45:43.875
What took you so long?
What were you doing back there?

45:43.958 --> 45:46.500
I told you. Something wasn't right.
Something was different.

45:46.583 --> 45:47.791
-I had to--
-Had to what?

45:47.875 --> 45:50.666
What wasn't right?
We secured the source, didn't we?

45:50.750 --> 45:54.041
Yes, but… This is not the right time
to be having this conversation.

45:54.125 --> 45:57.041
Agreed. We should jump
while there's something left to jump from.

45:57.125 --> 46:00.750
Jump? You must be mad.
We're way too high. We'll break our necks.

46:00.833 --> 46:04.291
Ready? One, two, three!
