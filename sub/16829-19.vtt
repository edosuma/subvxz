00:00.001 --> 00:03.302
<i> Previously on</i> Scorpion...
I just want a huge wedding.

00:03.304 --> 00:05.237
I never dreamed I'd marry
a babe like you, I...

00:05.239 --> 00:07.373
It's the greatest
accomplishment of my life.

00:07.375 --> 00:09.241
I just...
I want everyone to know it.

00:09.243 --> 00:11.377
I'm a little closed, and
that's not the best way for us

00:11.379 --> 00:12.544
to start our new
life together.

00:12.546 --> 00:13.779
If our marriage is gonna work,

00:13.781 --> 00:16.382
I need to be able
to express myself better.

00:16.384 --> 00:18.083
The Warlock's Chest storefront

00:18.085 --> 00:20.019
is 90 years old.

00:20.021 --> 00:21.186
Old enough to fall
under the auspices

00:21.188 --> 00:23.138
of the Historic
Zoning Commission,

00:23.139 --> 00:25.089
so I am filing papers
to prevent its destruction.

00:25.092 --> 00:26.325
We may have lost the war,

00:26.327 --> 00:28.293
but Sly won
the battle.

00:28.295 --> 00:31.030
I'm gonna ask Cabe
if he wants to hang out tonight.

00:31.032 --> 00:32.398
I think he could
use a friend.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.900
TOBY:
That was empathy.

00:33.901 --> 00:35.401
Walter identified
emotional pain in someone else

00:35.403 --> 00:37.336
and demonstrated empathy.

00:37.338 --> 00:39.038
You can't empathize
if you haven't been through

00:39.040 --> 00:40.606
a similar situation yourself.

00:44.478 --> 00:47.146
The heir shall approach.

00:54.121 --> 00:56.355
Our brotherhood was threatened

00:56.357 --> 00:58.657
by those who wished
to vanquish our realm,

00:58.659 --> 01:00.626
but they were smitten...
Smote.

01:00.628 --> 01:02.294
They were smoten.
No. Just smote.

01:02.296 --> 01:03.429
They were smote

01:03.431 --> 01:05.097
by the brave defender

01:05.099 --> 01:06.298
of The Warlock's Chest,

01:06.300 --> 01:09.301
Sylvester the Conquestor.

01:09.303 --> 01:11.103
And in the tradition
of our forbearers,

01:11.105 --> 01:14.606
we present thee
with the Stone of Valor.

01:21.315 --> 01:23.148
Wise Dyfrost, it is with

01:23.150 --> 01:27.119
the greatest humility
that I do accept...

01:27.121 --> 01:28.854
(chuckles) Sorry.
I just got to put this away.

01:28.856 --> 01:31.323
Gary. We're knighting someone.

01:31.325 --> 01:33.525
GARY: Mini-fridge doesn't
stock itself, boys.

01:33.527 --> 01:36.762
Okay? All right,
back to your skit.

01:36.764 --> 01:39.398
Okay, well, let's just...

01:39.400 --> 01:41.100
(grunts)

01:41.102 --> 01:42.434
...finish the ceremony. Right?

01:42.436 --> 01:46.238
Uh, I get
the Goblet of Yar and then

01:46.240 --> 01:49.241
I drink the Blood of the Condor.

01:49.243 --> 01:51.310
To The Warlock's Chest.

01:52.480 --> 01:53.679
Damn it.

01:53.681 --> 01:55.447
(whispering):
I forgot the fruit punch.

01:56.717 --> 01:58.550
CABE: Guarantee no kids
in Russia or China

01:58.552 --> 02:00.352
are doing this goofy crap.

02:00.354 --> 02:02.287
Shame on you for hacking this.

02:02.289 --> 02:04.223
I didn't. Sly must've plugged
into their security cameras

02:04.225 --> 02:05.591
to download the ceremony
to his laptop,

02:05.593 --> 02:07.593
which he forgot to close.
I found it running

02:07.595 --> 02:08.760
on a loop when I came in.

02:08.762 --> 02:09.761
It's uncomfortable.

02:09.763 --> 02:10.896
I feel guilty watching this.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.464
I feel sick watching it.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.133
Yet no one's looking away.

02:14.135 --> 02:15.767
Good morrow, compatriots!

02:15.769 --> 02:17.136
Good morrow

02:17.138 --> 02:18.704
to<i> you,</i> fine sir!

02:18.706 --> 02:21.507
That's a fancy little brooch
you got there.

02:21.509 --> 02:22.608
It is not a brooch.

02:22.610 --> 02:24.443
It is a stone of valor.

02:24.445 --> 02:26.578
Not a big deal...

02:26.580 --> 02:28.247
Kind of a big deal.

02:28.249 --> 02:29.414
Oh, Happy,
I think these pages are yours.

02:29.416 --> 02:30.482
"Wedding To-Do List"?

02:30.484 --> 02:31.817
Wow.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.418
It's long.
Yup.

02:33.420 --> 02:36.288
That's 'cause big weddings
are stupid time-sucks...

02:38.259 --> 02:39.909
...which we will look
back upon one day

02:39.910 --> 02:41.560
and realize was worth
all the hard work.

02:41.562 --> 02:42.528
Nice save.

02:42.530 --> 02:43.896
Well, I can help you
with it

02:43.898 --> 02:45.397
if you want.
It's fun, getting registered,

02:45.399 --> 02:47.666
floral arrangements,
trying on dresses.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.735
Hi. I'm Happy Quinn.
We've obviously never met.

02:49.737 --> 02:51.270
I'm serious.

02:51.272 --> 02:52.704
There's a lot on that list
that has to be done

02:52.706 --> 02:54.406
and you need someone
to assist you.

02:54.408 --> 02:57.209
Someone who
loves weddings,

02:57.211 --> 03:00.212
someone like a maid of honor.

03:00.214 --> 03:02.281
Okay, I get the incredibly
unsubtle hint.

03:02.283 --> 03:03.582
But we're not having
a wedding party.

03:03.584 --> 03:04.750
We're keeping it simple.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.618
No maid of honor? No best man?

03:06.620 --> 03:07.786
SYLVESTER: The best
man tradition is based

03:07.788 --> 03:09.521
on the morally questionable
tradition

03:09.523 --> 03:11.523
of 16th century Goths

03:11.525 --> 03:13.492
picking the man "best"
at stealing the bride

03:13.494 --> 03:15.627
from the neighboring village
the night before the wedding.

03:15.629 --> 03:17.429
TOBY: That's a
good point, Sly!

03:17.431 --> 03:19.398
Plus, I got three amigos.

03:19.399 --> 03:21.366
Couldn't bear breaking
the heart of two of them.

03:21.368 --> 03:22.401
I can see where having
to select one of us

03:22.403 --> 03:24.503
could disrupt the team dynamic.

03:24.504 --> 03:26.604
Plus, I can't have Cabe or Sly
upset at being shunned.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.207
Here we go.

03:28.209 --> 03:30.209
What makes you think
it'd be you?

03:30.211 --> 03:31.543
WALTER: Well,
as Toby's oldest friend

03:31.545 --> 03:33.545
and employer,
I'm the logical choice.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.881
So if he doesn't pick you,
he's fired?

03:35.883 --> 03:37.950
Well, how about the fact
that without my sage advice,

03:37.952 --> 03:39.551
he never would've landed
this little filly?

03:39.553 --> 03:42.221
Now I'm being compared
to a horse?

03:42.223 --> 03:44.623
Oh, thank you for getting
this ball rolling, Paige.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.558
Happy, may I interject?

03:46.560 --> 03:47.626
No.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.928
I am clearly the best man here.

03:49.930 --> 03:51.230
First and foremost,

03:51.232 --> 03:53.865
I bear the Stone of Valor.

03:53.867 --> 03:55.667
Plus, Toby and I are very close.

03:56.937 --> 03:59.271
You married my sister
without telling any of us.

03:59.273 --> 04:01.506
Besides, who are you
to comment on wedding parties?

04:01.508 --> 04:03.542
At least I was never
married to Happy.

04:03.544 --> 04:04.710
The ex-husband
as the best man?

04:04.712 --> 04:06.511
Gross. So, Toby, old pal,

04:06.513 --> 04:09.681
if you were gonna choose
one of us, who'd you pick?

04:13.821 --> 04:15.787
I don't like to deal
in hypotheticals.

04:15.789 --> 04:16.955
(ding)

04:16.957 --> 04:18.323
Did you hear that ding?
I heard it.

04:18.325 --> 04:19.925
That means Happy's testing
is finished.

04:19.927 --> 04:22.461
Follow me to see the results.

04:22.463 --> 04:24.563
This is very exciting, isn't it?

04:27.868 --> 04:29.901
What do we have here?

04:29.903 --> 04:33.505
Prep for our Department
of Energy windmill gig.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.575
Built a couple of winches

04:36.577 --> 04:37.643
to run a stress test.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.544
They've been going
on for 72 hours.

04:39.546 --> 04:42.581
This is currently what is
in the D.O.E.'s windmill.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.950
Standard steel,
already signs of wear.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.685
Problem with wind farming

04:46.687 --> 04:47.953
is wind hardly ever
takes a break,

04:47.955 --> 04:49.921
so the equipment
needs constant maintenance.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.923
Especially on the experimental
bladeless windmill

04:51.925 --> 04:53.458
we're upgrading.

04:53.460 --> 04:57.362
But I made this one from
a graphene alloy I designed.

04:57.364 --> 04:58.897
No wear. They'll
increase longevity

04:58.899 --> 05:02.334
of the new bladeless
turbines by over 60%.

05:02.336 --> 05:03.568
Okay, well, I'll
call Mr. Macholz

05:03.570 --> 05:05.120
at the Department of Energy,

05:05.121 --> 05:06.671
and tell him we're on
our way to the wind farm.

05:06.674 --> 05:09.408
And I am going to get
my ornithology binoculars.

05:09.410 --> 05:10.709
Where the wind farm is located

05:10.711 --> 05:13.312
is home
to<i> Geococcyx californianus,</i>

05:13.314 --> 05:14.713
also known as...

05:16.684 --> 05:17.883
...the roadrunner. Meep, meep.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.986
CABE:
Hey. Hold up a second.

05:22.589 --> 05:26.591
Are you sure you want Walt
to go to the D.O.E.?

05:26.593 --> 05:28.894
Last time he did that,
he cost Scorpion a gig.

05:28.896 --> 05:30.462
He's fine. He's working hard

05:30.464 --> 05:31.963
on his communication skills,
he's making progress.

05:31.965 --> 05:34.766
Don't need to work
on my communication skills.

05:34.768 --> 05:36.968
Naturally personable.
Everybody loves old Sly.

05:36.970 --> 05:39.688
I'm not picking a best man!

05:39.689 --> 05:42.407
You need to work on your
interpersonal skills, Toby.

05:43.711 --> 05:46.578
CABE:
<i>I will never cease to be amazed</i>

05:46.580 --> 05:48.747
<i> at what humankind can build.</i>

05:48.749 --> 05:50.515
Energy Valley<i> is</i> amazing.

05:50.517 --> 05:53.752
Wind farms, solar panels,
natural gas veins.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.053
And coming soon,

05:55.055 --> 05:57.656
a touch of Scorpion brilliance.

05:57.658 --> 05:59.091
Okay, I'm done.

05:59.093 --> 06:01.893
Okay, guys, Sly is linked
in to the turbine's server.

06:01.895 --> 06:04.663
As soon as you're done
with the gear installation,

06:04.665 --> 06:06.598
he can monitor
the electrical output.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.734
HAPPY:
We're almost fully installed,

06:08.736 --> 06:12.137
old parts replaced with new,
graphene-alloy counterparts.

06:12.139 --> 06:13.739
Offset hexagon key wrench?

06:13.741 --> 06:16.007
Walt's running
test diagnostics.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.809
<i> Ran</i> test diagnostics.

06:17.811 --> 06:19.945
And everything is
as it should be.

06:19.947 --> 06:22.381
Great. Mr. Macholz,
we're just a few moments away

06:22.383 --> 06:24.549
from finishing the installation,
and we'll run a live

06:24.551 --> 06:25.951
electrical output
soon thereafter.

06:25.953 --> 06:28.620
And thanks to the D.O.E.
for giving us another shot.

06:28.622 --> 06:29.921
We love turbines.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.823
Really big fans.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.392
You get it?

06:33.394 --> 06:34.793
Fans?

06:36.797 --> 06:38.430
Um, okay. Well,
we'll call you

06:38.432 --> 06:40.665
when we're on the ground
with the results.

06:40.667 --> 06:42.768
Did you get the joke, Toby?

06:42.770 --> 06:44.903
It's the kind of humor
that goes over well

06:44.905 --> 06:46.421
in toasts.

06:46.422 --> 06:47.938
CABE: That joke went over
like a submarine.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.808
A best man speech
has got to have zingers.

06:49.810 --> 06:52.644
You got to rip them apart,
like Rickles.

06:52.646 --> 06:54.780
I suggest
you don't insult your guests.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.181
Public speaking
has a formula, Toby.

06:56.183 --> 06:58.750
You have to combine
the concise verbiage

06:58.752 --> 07:01.019
of Kennedy speechwriter
Arthur Schlesinger

07:01.021 --> 07:03.922
with the witty wordplay
of tunesmith W.A. Yankovic.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.557
Who's Rickles?

07:05.559 --> 07:07.759
HAPPY:
You morons are arguing

07:07.761 --> 07:09.661
over a best man position
that won't be filled.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.563
No wedding party, remember?

07:11.565 --> 07:13.198
WALTER: I don't care
that there's no best man.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.766
I just want to know
that if there had been,

07:14.768 --> 07:16.802
it wouldn't have been
Sly or Cabe.

07:16.804 --> 07:18.970
And I was just saying
you were making progress.

07:21.675 --> 07:24.543
While the rest of the team
finishes in the control room,

07:24.545 --> 07:26.445
I'd like to present
you with this,

07:26.447 --> 07:29.147
The Cape of Windsor.

07:29.149 --> 07:33.018
Windsor? Like William
the Conqueror's Windsor Castle?

07:33.020 --> 07:35.921
No. This was manufactured
in Windsor, Ohio.

07:35.923 --> 07:37.522
But that's not important.

07:37.524 --> 07:39.858
What is important
is last evening,

07:39.860 --> 07:41.593
The Knights of West Altadenia

07:41.595 --> 07:43.862
assembled
for a vesting ceremony.

07:43.864 --> 07:46.698
And it was deemed that your
contributions to my campaign

07:46.700 --> 07:49.668
to help save The
Warlock's Chest shall not

07:49.670 --> 07:50.702
go unheralded.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.871
Oh, boy. This ain't good.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.072
My roundtable and I

07:54.074 --> 07:56.508
would like to invite
you to be knighted

07:56.510 --> 07:57.909
into our clan.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.744
Only the noble of spirit
and pure of heart

07:59.746 --> 08:01.146
have been invited to join.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.848
And afterwards, we play
Fantasies and Frolics

08:02.850 --> 08:04.983
and there's s'mores,
so, you know, fun.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.086
(chuckles)
Yeah.

08:08.088 --> 08:09.721
(chuckles)

08:09.723 --> 08:11.790
Yeah, this is a...

08:11.792 --> 08:14.526
This, uh...
hell of a cloak.

08:14.528 --> 08:15.994
Cape.
Cape.

08:15.996 --> 08:19.030
It's a hell of a cape.
But, uh...

08:19.032 --> 08:22.834
You know, I'm not, uh,
much of a game guy.

08:22.836 --> 08:23.935
Never been. So, uh...

08:23.937 --> 08:25.237
I know. I
just figured,

08:25.239 --> 08:26.972
since you and Happy
started playing Stratego...

08:26.974 --> 08:28.673
Well, that's true,

08:28.675 --> 08:30.876
but that's,
that's strategy and warfare.

08:30.878 --> 08:32.577
That's within my wheelhouse.

08:32.579 --> 08:34.746
Well, Fantasies and Frolics
covers over 12 eons of battle,

08:34.748 --> 08:37.649
from the Minotaur Rising
to the Troll Conflicts.

08:38.886 --> 08:43.688
Get ready for Sly heartbreak
in three, two, one...

08:43.690 --> 08:44.923
Yeah, see there,
that's the problem,

08:44.925 --> 08:46.758
there's this whole history
that I don't know,

08:46.760 --> 08:48.260
and I-I don't want to ruin it
for you guys.

08:48.262 --> 08:50.195
So...

08:52.633 --> 08:55.267
But I tell you what.

08:55.269 --> 08:57.269
I appreciate the invitation.

08:57.271 --> 08:59.204
You, you go tell the fellas
that I say thank you.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.841
Sure.

09:04.978 --> 09:06.811
(exhales)

09:06.813 --> 09:08.146
Thank God that's over.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.848
That was brutal.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.583
Okay, all set here.

09:11.585 --> 09:13.084
You two head down,

09:13.086 --> 09:14.586
I will help Toby pack up.

09:14.588 --> 09:16.821
'Cause that is what
a good man would do.

09:16.823 --> 09:19.090
Some would say, "best man."

09:19.092 --> 09:21.026
Just start packing the manuals.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.703
We'll need to track the
gears' heat coefficients

09:31.705 --> 09:33.171
once the turbine is turned on.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.574
I will call out the readings,
you can jot them down?

09:35.576 --> 09:36.708
Sure.

09:38.178 --> 09:39.744
It's funny
how you trust me to monitor

09:39.746 --> 09:40.845
multimillion-dollar
equipment,

09:40.847 --> 09:42.681
but not with choosing
a wedding dress.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.916
Why do you care that
I don't want a maid of honor?

09:44.918 --> 09:46.017
You're being weird about this.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.953
I am not being weird about

09:47.954 --> 09:49.888
the maid of honor thing,
I'm being weird because,

09:49.890 --> 09:52.190
I don't know, I just thought
maybe we'd grown close

09:52.192 --> 09:53.959
over the past couple years.

09:53.961 --> 09:54.993
What?

09:56.763 --> 09:59.030
We're-We're friends-ish.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.233
I like you just fine.

10:02.235 --> 10:05.170
What a ringing endorsement.

10:06.139 --> 10:07.839
(faint rattling)

10:07.841 --> 10:08.940
Happy...

10:08.942 --> 10:10.942
Are you even listening?

10:10.944 --> 10:13.178
HAPPY: No, the other
gondola's grip is loose.

10:14.648 --> 10:17.782
Hey, Sly, does that
look normal to you?

10:17.784 --> 10:18.984
That gondola's not stable.

10:18.986 --> 10:20.051
It's about to break.

10:24.391 --> 10:25.357
(yells)

10:25.358 --> 10:26.324
They're falling!

10:26.326 --> 10:29.094
We need to stop the cable wheel.

10:31.898 --> 10:33.231
(grunting)

10:36.903 --> 10:38.036
TOBY:
<i> Happy!</i>

10:38.038 --> 10:39.705
Paige, are you okay?

10:39.706 --> 10:41.373
Uh, a little banged up,
but all right.

10:42.909 --> 10:46.211
Except for the hanging-150-
feet-up-in-the-air part.

10:46.213 --> 10:47.979
WALTER:
The D.O.E. must've repurposed

10:47.981 --> 10:49.814
a gondola from a ski lodge
or something.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.683
The mechanics weren't designed
for high winds.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.018
Repetitive stress

10:53.020 --> 10:54.753
had to have caused
parts failure.

10:54.755 --> 10:55.987
How'd you stop
the free fall?

10:55.989 --> 10:58.056
I improvised a brake.

10:58.058 --> 11:00.042
That won't last long.
I'm just eyeballing it,

11:00.043 --> 11:02.027
but it seems to be
slipping about two inches

11:02.029 --> 11:04.896
every 15 seconds,
and we've only got about, uh,

11:04.898 --> 11:06.064
15 feet of cable left.

11:06.066 --> 11:07.732
SYLVESTER:
That's eight inches a minute.

11:07.734 --> 11:08.900
That gives us
22 and a half minutes

11:08.902 --> 11:10.435
before the cable runs
through the works,

11:10.437 --> 11:12.337
and that gondola falls.

11:12.339 --> 11:15.940

11:21.848 --> 11:23.882
Copy that.
I just got off the phone

11:23.884 --> 11:25.000
with the fire department.

11:25.001 --> 11:26.117
Their tallest
ladder is 100 feet.

11:26.119 --> 11:27.419
What about a rescue chopper?

11:27.421 --> 11:29.254
Closest one is helping a hiker

11:29.256 --> 11:30.822
who fell down into a ravine.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.457
What about the crane
that built this thing?

11:32.459 --> 11:34.276
They take hours to set up.

11:34.277 --> 11:36.094
What about a jumper's pad?
Well, not from this height.

11:36.096 --> 11:37.796
Besides, what would
we even build it out of?

11:37.798 --> 11:40.098
Guys, every 15 seconds we're
two inches closer to splatter,

11:40.100 --> 11:41.966
and I don't want Ralph being
raised by four lunatics.

11:41.968 --> 11:44.269
So just get us
the hell down from here.

11:44.271 --> 11:45.437
We can't do that.

11:45.439 --> 11:46.888
Are you kidding me?

11:46.889 --> 11:48.338
This is the one thing
you guys can't figure out?!

11:48.341 --> 11:50.408
No, I mean
we can't get you down,

11:50.410 --> 11:51.943
so we're gonna have
to get you up.

11:51.945 --> 11:53.595
Walt, I've been getting in shape
for the wedding,

11:53.596 --> 11:55.246
but deadlifting 2,000 pounds
might be a bit much for me.

11:55.248 --> 11:57.115
Mass times gravity
times diameter divided by two.

11:57.117 --> 11:59.501
It's elementary school science.

11:59.502 --> 12:01.886
So, we can reconfigure parts
of the turbine to make a winch,

12:01.888 --> 12:03.154
just like the winch
that Happy used

12:03.156 --> 12:04.989
to stress-test the gear
at the garage.

12:04.991 --> 12:06.791
You could use the winch
to lift us.

12:06.793 --> 12:08.727
All the components you need
are in the mechanics

12:08.729 --> 12:10.495
you've got up there.
This could work.

12:10.497 --> 12:12.297
As the turbine turns,

12:12.298 --> 12:14.098
the cable wraps around it,
but we'll need at least

12:14.101 --> 12:16.367
five feet of cable
to wrap around the winch.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.203
That means we don't have
15 feet of cable

12:18.205 --> 12:19.204
and 22 and a half minutes.

12:19.206 --> 12:20.505
We have ten feet of cable

12:20.507 --> 12:21.940
and 15 minutes.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.308
Okay. Let's hurry

12:23.310 --> 12:25.761
and puncture a hole
in the drive shaft.

12:25.762 --> 12:28.213
You left the drill in the back
of the truck, didn't you, Happy?

12:28.215 --> 12:29.380
I "left" it?

12:29.382 --> 12:31.149
I left the drill
in the truck

12:31.150 --> 12:32.917
because I wouldn't need it
here up in the control room.

12:32.919 --> 12:34.385
Really? That's crazy
because I'm thinking

12:34.387 --> 12:35.920
of a way I need one right now!

12:35.922 --> 12:39.491
Man, they sound like
they've been married for years.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.128
This can't weigh more
than four pounds.

12:43.130 --> 12:45.930
No one has that
good of an arm.

12:45.932 --> 12:46.931
We're not gonna throw it.

12:46.933 --> 12:48.066
We're gonna float it.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.934
Now, get the tarp
from the truck bed

12:49.936 --> 12:52.804
and I will find a heat source
that will seal the seam.

12:55.876 --> 12:58.276
This lighter should
provide enough heat.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.011
Mind cluing me in here, Sly?

13:00.013 --> 13:01.096
We're building a balloon.

13:01.097 --> 13:02.180
We're gonna fill it
with methane.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.865
There's not enough jerky
in the world

13:03.866 --> 13:05.549
for you and I to fill
this thing with methane.
Not from us.

13:05.552 --> 13:07.519
This is Energy Valley,
remember?

13:07.521 --> 13:09.521
There are natural gas lines
crisscrossing this region

13:09.523 --> 13:12.007
a few miles from here.

13:12.008 --> 13:14.492
You drive while I cut and melt
the tarp's plastic into shape.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.133
Okay, Sly and Cabe
are making the balloon.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.035
Walter and Toby are prepping
the winch. We got a shot.

13:24.037 --> 13:26.404
We'd have a better shot
if I was building that winch.

13:26.406 --> 13:27.839
Hey, that's uncalled for.

13:27.841 --> 13:29.507
Toby and I are more
than capable of...

13:29.509 --> 13:31.843
We don't need capable,
we need masterful.

13:31.845 --> 13:32.844
Get back to work.

13:32.846 --> 13:33.978
Okay.

13:33.980 --> 13:35.246
We're all a little tense
for good reason.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.848
How about we try
and keep our mind off things?

13:36.850 --> 13:38.049
Uh...

13:38.051 --> 13:39.217
let's go over
your wedding to-do list.

13:39.218 --> 13:40.384
Each item we get through,
the closer we are

13:40.387 --> 13:41.486
to Cabe and Sly
getting back here.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.221
No, thank you.

13:43.223 --> 13:44.923
Okay, we have
to occupy our minds.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.491
First thing, flowers.
I like calla lilies.

13:46.493 --> 13:49.093
Roses are nice. Um, white
<i> stephanotis</i> are beautiful.

13:49.095 --> 13:50.495
I don't want to do this.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.997
Fine. Let's-Let's talk location.
Uh...

13:52.999 --> 13:54.499
uh, a beach wedding
is romantic.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.835
Okay, would you just
shut it already?

13:56.836 --> 13:59.170
TOBY: Guys, right now is not
the best time for fighting.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.172
It's a very good time
for teamwork, though.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.874
Quiet, Toby.

14:02.876 --> 14:04.976
Yes, dear.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.277
Sounds like you guys
have been married for years.

14:07.981 --> 14:11.616
Look, I'm just not into talking
to you about the wedding, okay?

14:11.618 --> 14:13.952
Right, 'cause
we're only friends-ish.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.353
We're friends.

14:15.355 --> 14:18.289
Of course we're friends.

14:18.291 --> 14:21.526
You're like the first non-genius
I could ever stand.

14:21.528 --> 14:24.596
It's just that all the flowers
and pink taffeta,

14:24.598 --> 14:26.297
it's just not my bag.

14:26.299 --> 14:29.000
I'm a genius, not a cheerleader.

14:30.136 --> 14:31.536
Not how I meant it to sound.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.271
It depends.

14:33.272 --> 14:35.005
Did you mean it to sound
obnoxious and rude?

14:35.008 --> 14:36.207
'Cause if so, you were
right on the money.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.542
It came out wrong.

14:37.544 --> 14:38.977
No, it came out accurately.

14:38.979 --> 14:40.979
You-You guys love facts,
you just stated one.

14:40.981 --> 14:43.514
You're a genius.
I'm a dumb cheerleader,

14:43.516 --> 14:44.983
and I'm too stupid
to be friends with you.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.985
Paige.
No, d-don't worry

14:46.987 --> 14:48.486
because, for the next
few minutes of our life,

14:48.488 --> 14:50.054
this stupid pom-pom girl

14:50.056 --> 14:51.890
won't bother you anymore.

14:51.892 --> 14:52.991
Oh, and by the way,

14:52.993 --> 14:54.092
I went to the
'01 nationals,

14:54.094 --> 14:56.227
and I was top
of the pyramid, baby.

15:04.037 --> 15:06.504
(groans)

15:06.506 --> 15:07.906
Getting there.

15:07.908 --> 15:09.974
Getting there.

15:09.976 --> 15:13.011
Okay, gears are secured and
greased for maximum rotation.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.178
We just need that drill.

15:15.148 --> 15:16.981
TOBY: We've lost a
few feet on the cable.

15:16.983 --> 15:18.650
We're running out of time.

15:18.652 --> 15:20.251
Sly, we got
under ten minutes left.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.020
Hurry up with that tool,
you tool.

15:22.022 --> 15:24.489
Nearly done with the heat seal,
and don't call me a tool.

15:24.491 --> 15:25.924
Come on, kid.

15:25.926 --> 15:28.693
Okay, ready. Let's go.

15:35.001 --> 15:36.568
Okay.

15:36.569 --> 15:38.136
I got the opening over
the methane valve.

15:38.138 --> 15:39.270
Is this thing
really gonna float?

15:39.272 --> 15:40.538
It's lighter than air

15:40.540 --> 15:42.240
and crazy flammable. Careful.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.276
(gas hisses)

15:45.278 --> 15:47.445
(whoops)

15:47.447 --> 15:50.248
All right. It's working!

15:52.085 --> 15:53.985
TOBY:
<i> They're gonna be here soon.</i>

15:53.987 --> 15:56.220
You know, one of us is
gonna have to reach out

15:56.222 --> 15:57.255
over this platform and
grab that balloon.

15:57.257 --> 15:59.190
That's just what
I was thinking.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.192
That's a long way down.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.263
That's why I should do it.
Okay.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.233
I had a whole explanation
about how it's treacherous,

16:09.235 --> 16:10.735
and-and since
you're getting married,

16:10.737 --> 16:12.036
you shouldn't take the risk...

16:12.038 --> 16:13.571
Unnecessary.
I don't want to do it.

16:13.573 --> 16:15.173
That's too high, but you'll
definitely earn best-man points.

16:15.175 --> 16:16.240
Good luck.

16:20.246 --> 16:22.313
Guys, Cabe and Sly are back.

16:31.524 --> 16:33.291
Okay, Walter, I did some

16:33.293 --> 16:36.194
quick calculations based
on wind speed, trajectory,

16:36.196 --> 16:37.395
the weight of the tarp
and the drill...

16:37.396 --> 16:38.595
Would you just let it
fly already?

16:38.598 --> 16:41.199
You got it.
Godspeed, power tool.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.105
That's some upchuck.

16:47.107 --> 16:49.207
Get it?

16:49.209 --> 16:51.609
Piece on the drill
is called a chuck.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.378
It's going up.
Upchuck.

16:53.380 --> 16:56.347
Your best man speech
will be hysterical.

17:02.622 --> 17:04.222
There it goes.
Our only shot.

17:04.224 --> 17:06.324
And if a guy who never played
sports can't catch it,

17:06.326 --> 17:07.325
we're screwed.

17:07.327 --> 17:10.061
Okay.
It's 20 feet away.

17:10.063 --> 17:12.530
15 feet.

17:12.532 --> 17:13.698
I'm gonna hold
onto your belt loop.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.466
No, no, don't touch.
Oh, crap.

17:15.468 --> 17:17.335
Oh, crap.
Oh, crap.

17:18.304 --> 17:22.173
(shouts)
Got it, got it.

17:22.175 --> 17:26.644
It's a good thing I had ahold
of your belt loop, huh?

17:26.646 --> 17:28.679
Stop playing grab-ass
and drill the winch hole.

17:36.556 --> 17:37.789
Guys, in one minute
the gondola will fall.

17:37.791 --> 17:39.090
Start the turbine.

17:39.092 --> 17:41.292
Look, I'm almost ready.
Just hang on.

17:44.264 --> 17:46.197
No pun intended.

17:46.198 --> 17:48.131
Okay, cable's through
the hole of the drive shaft.

17:48.134 --> 17:49.267
Start it up.

17:54.274 --> 17:56.340
Okay, cable's secured.

17:56.342 --> 17:58.643
Ladies, I am about
to remove the only thing

17:58.645 --> 18:00.478
that has been keeping you
from plummeting to the earth,

18:00.480 --> 18:03.281
but it seems the winch will
continue to rotate once removed.

18:03.283 --> 18:04.282
"Seems"?!

18:04.284 --> 18:05.750
WALTER:
And once we remove it,

18:05.751 --> 18:07.217
then the winch should catch.
"Should"?

18:07.220 --> 18:08.286
TOBY:
Brace yourself.

18:15.161 --> 18:16.861
We're going up.

18:16.863 --> 18:19.330
They're going up.

18:19.332 --> 18:21.699
Wow! Hey, it's working.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.167
The wedding is still on.

18:23.169 --> 18:24.502
Can't get rid of me
that easy, Quinn.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.574
Looks like we made it, huh?

18:32.212 --> 18:33.678
Yeah. Guess we did.

18:33.680 --> 18:37.815
Since we'll be on more solid
footing in a few minutes,

18:37.817 --> 18:39.717
I'd like to say
something to you. Comms out.

18:39.719 --> 18:40.718
Not good.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.386
Damn right, not good.

18:42.388 --> 18:44.489
You guys fighting again?
Hello?

18:44.491 --> 18:47.191
I don't need you to tell me

18:47.193 --> 18:48.526
that I am not as smart
as you guys.

18:48.528 --> 18:50.228
I am painfully aware
of it every day.

18:50.230 --> 18:53.264
Every invention
I don't understand,

18:53.266 --> 18:57.168
every formula I can't solve,
every reference I don't get...

18:57.170 --> 18:58.436
Like MIT students

18:58.437 --> 18:59.703
trying to follow
a Jeffrey Hoffman lecture.

18:59.706 --> 19:01.873
See, I-I have no idea
what you're talking about.

19:01.875 --> 19:05.610
But even if I can't keep up, I
thought I at least measured up

19:05.612 --> 19:08.613
as a-a valued team
member, as a friend,

19:08.615 --> 19:11.616
but I guess you just, you just
always saw me as an inferior.

19:11.618 --> 19:13.284
Paige, that is not correct.

19:13.286 --> 19:15.186
Oh, what a surprise.
Something else I got wrong.

19:15.188 --> 19:16.538
You know what, I hope
they speed that winch up

19:16.539 --> 19:17.889
'cause I don't want to spend
another second with you

19:17.891 --> 19:18.890
in this box.

19:18.892 --> 19:20.591
(metal whines)
Whoa.

19:25.465 --> 19:27.565
Oh, man, we're stuck.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.233
Perfect.

19:35.475 --> 19:37.575
Oh, I found the problem.
Wind speed's dropped from 21

19:37.577 --> 19:39.377
to 11 miles per hour.
That is too slow

19:39.379 --> 19:41.212
to create enough power
to spin the winch.

19:41.214 --> 19:42.213
So, we're stuck here
until the wind

19:42.215 --> 19:44.215
picks up?
TOBY: Not exactly.

19:44.217 --> 19:45.583
Our makeshift winch
is starting to give.

19:45.585 --> 19:47.018
(winch creaking)

19:47.019 --> 19:48.452
That's because
I didn't design the drive shaft

19:48.454 --> 19:50.388
to hold thousands of pounds
of dead weight

19:50.390 --> 19:51.556
pulling on it straight down.

19:51.558 --> 19:52.657
If it was turning,
it could hold us.

19:52.659 --> 19:53.691
But constant pressure?

19:53.693 --> 19:54.692
It's not gonna last too long.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.227
How long
before it breaks?

19:56.229 --> 19:57.762
I'm looking
at Happy's design specs.

19:57.764 --> 19:58.829
Based on the PSI,

19:58.831 --> 20:00.731
18 minutes
until complete failure.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.400
PAIGE:
So, we're gonna die because

20:02.402 --> 20:03.401
it's not breezy out anymore.

20:03.403 --> 20:04.502
We stopped a tornado once.

20:04.504 --> 20:06.454
Can't we kick up some wind?

20:06.455 --> 20:08.405
No, but you can kick out
a little weight.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.541
An 11-mile-per-hour wind
should power the winch

20:10.543 --> 20:12.743
as long as it doesn't have
to haul that much cargo.

20:12.745 --> 20:14.645
I'm terrified to say this,
ladies,

20:14.647 --> 20:16.647
but you might have
to shed a few pounds.

20:16.649 --> 20:17.648
We're gonna need
more than a few.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.100
To uncompromise the winch,

20:19.101 --> 20:20.551
we're gonna need
to cut the gondola loose.

20:20.553 --> 20:21.652
Yeah, I don't like that idea.

20:21.654 --> 20:22.820
WALTER:
It's our only shot.

20:22.822 --> 20:24.322
Now, you and Happy
get up on the roof,

20:24.324 --> 20:25.590
hang onto the cable, and then

20:25.592 --> 20:27.391
we'll sever the cable
to detach the gondola.

20:27.393 --> 20:28.826
You two can't
weigh more than,

20:28.828 --> 20:30.795
together, 250 pounds, right?

20:30.797 --> 20:32.496
BOTH:
240.

20:32.498 --> 20:33.798
WALTER:
Minimal carriage.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.617
Even for a warped winch.

20:35.618 --> 20:37.435
Hey, I hate to be
the bearer of bad questions,

20:37.437 --> 20:39.237
but how in the name of
reinforced braided steel

20:39.239 --> 20:40.404
are we gonna cut the cable?

20:40.406 --> 20:41.572
Hadn't considered that yet.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.274
CABE:
Yeah, well, I have.

20:43.276 --> 20:46.244
And I've got an idea, but Paige
and Happy might not like it.

20:46.246 --> 20:48.446
It's worse than Walter's idea?

20:48.448 --> 20:49.480
CABE:
I'm gonna shoot

20:49.482 --> 20:50.414
through the cable.

20:50.416 --> 20:52.416
A high caliber rifle

20:52.418 --> 20:53.884
will knock that gondola
clean off.

20:53.886 --> 20:55.753
And if you miss, our heads.

20:55.755 --> 20:58.623
A headless bride might
crimp my nuptials.

20:58.625 --> 20:59.757
Uh, Cabe,
know you're a good shot,

20:59.759 --> 21:00.925
but how good?

21:00.927 --> 21:02.827
I got my marksmanship
qualification

21:02.829 --> 21:04.629
when I was in the Corps.
Now, we only got

21:04.631 --> 21:05.997
12 minutes left?
Barely 11 minutes.

21:05.999 --> 21:07.031
Then we better hightail it back

21:07.033 --> 21:08.466
to that gun store we passed

21:08.467 --> 21:09.900
about a mile back.
With the way
Cabe drives,

21:09.902 --> 21:12.003
we should be back with one
minute or so to spare.

21:12.005 --> 21:13.671
Okay, then go already!

21:14.907 --> 21:16.707
Man, they're cutting it close.

21:16.709 --> 21:18.743
Something as small as
a-a slow checkout clerk

21:18.745 --> 21:20.444
at the gun shop
could mean they fall.

21:20.446 --> 21:22.280
Toby's right;
we need to buy more time.

21:22.282 --> 21:24.448
You need to get rid of any extra
weight the gondola is holding.

21:24.450 --> 21:28.919
Now, every pound jettisoned can
give us extra crucial seconds

21:28.921 --> 21:30.788
before the winch falls.
(grunts)

21:30.790 --> 21:34.425
So, while Toby and I try
to stop this thing from bending,

21:34.427 --> 21:36.794
you two dump anything
that isn't essential.

21:36.796 --> 21:39.630
(grunts)

21:41.701 --> 21:43.367
Hey, take it easy.

21:43.369 --> 21:45.369
It's cheap workmanship.
Okay, open the door,

21:45.371 --> 21:46.804
this thing is going overboard.

21:56.716 --> 21:58.082
PAIGE:
That could be us.

21:58.084 --> 22:00.351
We got to keep
lessening our load. Come on.

22:02.689 --> 22:04.372
(door bell chimes)

22:04.373 --> 22:06.056
Agent Cabe Gallo,
Homeland Security.

22:06.059 --> 22:09.627
I need to commandeer a
Desert Tech HTI sniper rifle.

22:09.629 --> 22:11.595
It's a matter of life and death.
Excuse you,

22:11.597 --> 22:12.897
I'm with a customer,
you'll need to wait.

22:14.734 --> 22:16.434
I don't think you understand.

22:16.436 --> 22:17.702
I'm an agent
of the U.S. government.

22:17.704 --> 22:19.770
Well, as an agent
of the U.S. government,

22:19.772 --> 22:21.539
you would know
that the law requires

22:21.541 --> 22:22.740
a ten-day
waiting period

22:22.742 --> 22:24.442
before the sale
of a firearm.

22:24.444 --> 22:26.644
CABE: And as a licensed
firearms merchant

22:26.646 --> 22:28.846
in the state of California,
you should know

22:28.848 --> 22:32.483
that this badge allows me
emergency appropriation.

22:32.485 --> 22:33.617
Look, for all I know,
that's fake

22:33.619 --> 22:35.553
and you're some kook
who's just...

22:36.789 --> 22:38.989
Is that the Stone of Valor?

22:40.993 --> 22:43.527
Uh, yes. Yes, it is.

22:43.529 --> 22:44.729
My liege.

22:45.732 --> 22:47.965
I am Erhlic
of the Desert Dwellers,

22:47.967 --> 22:50.501
fourth son of Ravenswood,
uh, gunsmith

22:50.503 --> 22:52.703
to the House of Thames.
I'm at your service.

22:53.806 --> 22:55.873
You got to be kidding me.

22:56.709 --> 22:59.110
At ease, brave Erhlic.

23:00.079 --> 23:02.413
Two of my clan
are in grave peril

23:02.415 --> 23:03.748
and we beseech your aid.

23:03.750 --> 23:04.882
Say no more.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.751
The weapon you seek
shall be yours.

23:11.424 --> 23:13.791
I bet he would have
appreciated the cape.

23:15.461 --> 23:17.228
TOBY:
Happy, we can't keep this winch

23:17.229 --> 23:18.996
from breaking for much longer;
you got to shed more weight.

23:18.998 --> 23:21.732
Anything that could be tossed
is already on the ground.

23:21.734 --> 23:24.101
Only thing left is our clothes,
and we're not dying naked.

23:24.103 --> 23:26.771
Can't hold on much longer,
even with the reduced weight.

23:26.773 --> 23:28.038
We have less than 90 seconds

23:28.040 --> 23:29.707
before this
thing snaps.

23:29.709 --> 23:30.841
Where's Cabe?

23:30.843 --> 23:31.842
CABE:
Right here!

23:31.844 --> 23:32.943
I got the rifle.

23:34.714 --> 23:36.180
Ladies, get topside.

23:40.987 --> 23:42.486
(grunts)

23:44.757 --> 23:46.490
Oh, boy.

23:54.066 --> 23:54.965
Little help!

24:05.545 --> 24:07.645
Okay, we're out.

24:07.647 --> 24:08.879
Get up that cable and hold on.

24:12.885 --> 24:16.187
Rifle's locked in. I'm ready.
SYLVESTER: But they're not.

24:16.189 --> 24:17.955
There isn't enough clearance
to take the shot.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.824
Ladies, you got
to keep climbing.

24:19.826 --> 24:21.859
And do it fast!
The winch is starting to snap.

24:21.861 --> 24:24.929
We got 60 seconds until
everything starts tumbling down!

24:24.931 --> 24:25.963
HAPPY:
We're trying to!

24:25.965 --> 24:26.997
The cable's coated

24:26.999 --> 24:28.599
in lithium compound grease,

24:28.601 --> 24:31.135
specifically designed to prevent
things from gripping it!

24:31.137 --> 24:34.238
I have an idea.
Happy, I'm coming up.

24:36.042 --> 24:38.108
(panting)

24:41.013 --> 24:42.847
(grunts)

24:42.849 --> 24:44.515
Okay,

24:44.517 --> 24:46.784
I'm gonna wrap my foot in
the cable and lean back a bit.

24:46.786 --> 24:48.752
You'll step on my foot
and lean back, too.

24:48.754 --> 24:50.187
Our weight will
counterbalance each other

24:50.189 --> 24:51.856
and make it easier
for us to climb up.

24:51.858 --> 24:53.691
And then you'll
wrap your foot

24:53.693 --> 24:56.760
and we'll alternate
all the way up.

24:58.898 --> 25:01.065
There you go. Got it?

25:01.067 --> 25:02.833
HAPPY:
Yeah. I'm good.

25:02.835 --> 25:04.268
Pretty close quarters
for two people

25:04.270 --> 25:05.970
who couldn't stand
being in the same box together.

25:05.972 --> 25:08.973
Yeah, well, the irony isn't lost
on me, either.

25:08.975 --> 25:11.075
All right, let's climb. Okay.

25:11.077 --> 25:12.977
SYLVESTER:
We've got five feet

25:12.979 --> 25:15.513
of clearance, wind is steady.
Take the shot.

25:19.886 --> 25:21.218
(winch creaking)

25:21.220 --> 25:24.021
Why don't I hear a gunshot?
We have 30 seconds!

25:24.023 --> 25:25.890
If I'm off by a hair,
I take their heads off.

25:25.892 --> 25:27.024
Give me a second.

25:27.026 --> 25:28.292
It's now or never, Cabe.

25:29.562 --> 25:30.561
PAIGE:
Hurry!

25:30.563 --> 25:31.262
It's hard to hold on.

25:31.264 --> 25:32.196
Do it, Cabe!

25:39.038 --> 25:39.937
Nothing happened!

25:39.939 --> 25:41.071
SYLVESTER:
Cabe missed.

25:41.073 --> 25:42.006
He missed the shot.

25:42.008 --> 25:43.491
Hey, Cabe, what about

25:43.492 --> 25:44.975
that marksmanship qualification
from the Marines?

25:44.977 --> 25:47.611
I haven't fired a rifle
like this in ten years.

25:47.613 --> 25:48.712
Give Sly a sec

25:48.714 --> 25:49.813
to sight it in.

25:49.815 --> 25:51.432
The vapor trail indicates

25:51.433 --> 25:53.050
we need to adjust the barrel
one degree east.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.118
Copy that.

25:57.823 --> 26:00.057
All right, stand back
and watch the magic.

26:00.993 --> 26:02.126
(bullet ricochets)

26:02.128 --> 26:03.294
Damn it.

26:03.296 --> 26:04.795
Are you kidding me, Cabe?

26:04.797 --> 26:06.864
I've seen better magic
at birthday parties.

26:06.866 --> 26:08.699
We're getting tired.

26:08.701 --> 26:09.934
We only have five seconds left
until...

26:11.037 --> 26:12.202
(bullet whizzes past)

26:13.839 --> 26:16.140
(gondola creaking)

26:19.645 --> 26:21.579
It's working. It's turning.
Cabe,

26:21.581 --> 26:23.047
I never doubted you
for one moment, my man.

26:23.049 --> 26:25.215
Happy, the winch is moving
faster with the lighter load.

26:25.217 --> 26:26.951
You're gonna be back
in my loving arms in no time.

26:26.953 --> 26:28.018
SYLVESTER:
I don't know about that.

26:28.020 --> 26:29.587
Relieving the tensile pressure

26:29.589 --> 26:31.689
on the cable triggered
aeroelastic flutter.

26:31.691 --> 26:34.124
I don't know what that means,
but it's shaking us loose!

26:34.126 --> 26:36.060
Well, Happy and Paige are acting
like a pendulum right now.

26:36.062 --> 26:38.128
The more they slip down,

26:38.130 --> 26:40.030
the more erratic
they'll start to swing.

26:40.032 --> 26:42.099
The more they swing,
the more they'll slip!

26:42.101 --> 26:43.767
How long before
the winch works back up

26:43.769 --> 26:44.969
and they get to the top?

26:44.971 --> 26:46.387
90 seconds.

26:46.388 --> 26:47.804
There's nothing we can do
to accelerate the winch.

26:47.807 --> 26:49.290
We're at the mercy of the wind.

26:49.291 --> 26:50.774
Happy, how much cable
is underneath you?

26:51.811 --> 26:53.978
Three feet, but
shrinking fast!

26:53.980 --> 26:55.746
They can't get a good grip
on the cable.

26:55.748 --> 26:57.081
They're gonna slip off
before they're pulled up.

26:57.083 --> 26:58.616
Then we help them
grip it tighter.

26:58.618 --> 27:00.384
I have a way to make it
so that they can't let go.

27:00.386 --> 27:01.819
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:01.821 --> 27:03.053
Walt, I think I know
what you're thinking

27:03.055 --> 27:04.288
and I don't like
what I think you're thinking.

27:04.290 --> 27:06.056
We are inside
a power plant.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.224
We have
all the electrical current

27:07.225 --> 27:08.391
that we need.
Whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:08.394 --> 27:09.793
That could kill them!
Only if

27:09.795 --> 27:11.095
the doctor with the highest IQ
in the world

27:11.097 --> 27:12.963
messes up,
and I believe that he won't.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.033
What are you planning?

27:16.035 --> 27:17.101
WALTER: We're gonna run
an electrical current

27:17.103 --> 27:18.686
through the cable.

27:18.687 --> 27:20.270
Now, at its proper levels,
it will cause tetany,

27:20.272 --> 27:22.806
the severe involuntary
muscular contractions.

27:22.808 --> 27:24.775
They will be physically
incapable of letting go.

27:24.777 --> 27:26.176
And at the improper levels?

27:26.178 --> 27:27.978
You're electrocuted.

27:27.980 --> 27:31.348
Tetany happens at a very exact
range of 16 to 19 milliamps.

27:31.350 --> 27:34.985
A hair above that sweet spot,
guaranteed cardiac arrest!

27:34.987 --> 27:37.821
I am not risking
electrocuting my fiancée!

27:37.823 --> 27:38.989
I'm still here, too.

27:38.991 --> 27:41.859
Or electrocuting Paige. My bad.

27:41.861 --> 27:43.861
If we do this,
they have a 50% chance of dying.

27:43.863 --> 27:46.030
If we don't, they have a 100%
chance of dying.

27:46.032 --> 27:47.865
They will be up here
in less than a minute.

27:47.867 --> 27:48.966
We can't hold
on any longer.

27:48.968 --> 27:51.135
Toby, just do it!

27:54.073 --> 27:57.307
All right, now, I'm gonna let
the cable run along the wire,

27:57.309 --> 27:58.909
never letting it rest
for too long,

27:58.911 --> 28:01.378
so I don't send too much current
to their bodies at once.

28:01.380 --> 28:03.347
Well, I can plug into
the energy monitoring software

28:03.349 --> 28:04.815
at the control shed,

28:04.816 --> 28:06.282
make sure the amps
stay in the tetany zone.

28:06.285 --> 28:07.985
Cabe, let's go.

28:07.987 --> 28:10.954
If any of us is tough enough
to do it, it's you two girls.

28:12.892 --> 28:14.425
TOBY: Walt, you stay
on that rubber mat

28:14.427 --> 28:16.994
and touch nothing metal
until I say so.

28:16.996 --> 28:20.264
Happy, Paige,
this is gonna hurt. I'm sorry.

28:22.768 --> 28:23.967
Just do it!

28:23.969 --> 28:25.836
(electrical zapping)

28:34.013 --> 28:37.181
We're at 16 milliamps;
they should be locked on
but conscious.

28:37.183 --> 28:38.282
Can you hear us, Happy?

28:38.284 --> 28:40.250
They're not responding!

28:40.252 --> 28:41.752
It's got to be working.

28:41.754 --> 28:43.087
They would've fallen by now
if it wasn't.

28:43.089 --> 28:44.288
We'll have them up here
in seconds.

28:44.290 --> 28:46.190
(electrical zapping)
(Paige grunts)

28:46.192 --> 28:48.125
TOBY:
You're doing great.

28:48.126 --> 28:50.059
Another 40 seconds,
this will all be over.

28:50.062 --> 28:51.361
(yells)

28:51.363 --> 28:53.230
Walt, wind's blowing harder!

28:53.232 --> 28:54.898
SYLVESTER:
Oh, no, 18 milliamps.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.400
The energy output must be rising

28:56.402 --> 28:57.735
because of an uptick
in wind speed.

28:57.737 --> 28:59.503
Well,
if it gets to 20 milliamps,

28:59.505 --> 29:01.004
their heart muscles will seize!

29:01.006 --> 29:02.372
Just a few more seconds.

29:02.374 --> 29:04.808
HAPPY:
Can't... take...

29:04.810 --> 29:08.178
any... more!

29:08.180 --> 29:09.179
Yeah, you can,
you're almost there!

29:10.382 --> 29:11.849
19 milliamps!

29:11.851 --> 29:13.951
First there was no wind,
now there's too much.

29:13.953 --> 29:15.152
I hate nature.

29:17.990 --> 29:19.523
Walt, they're up!
Cut the juice!

29:19.525 --> 29:20.758
(grunts)

29:25.831 --> 29:27.931
Second-degree burns
on the palms and fingers,

29:27.933 --> 29:29.616
but the pulse is good.

29:29.617 --> 29:31.300
Happy, come on.
Come on, say something.

29:31.303 --> 29:35.005
Don't ever electrocute me again.

29:35.007 --> 29:37.241
Oh, she's fine.
How's Paige?

29:37.243 --> 29:38.475
Same.

29:38.477 --> 29:40.110
How are you feeling?

29:40.112 --> 29:42.813
Pretty... amped up.

29:42.815 --> 29:44.848
I think that was a joke.

29:46.285 --> 29:48.318
Okay, gang, just sit tight.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.888
Rescue choppers are
on their way.

29:50.890 --> 29:53.157
You'll be back on terra firma
before you know it.

29:59.498 --> 30:00.864
All set.

30:00.866 --> 30:02.065
Thank you.

30:02.067 --> 30:03.433
You two really hung on
to each other up there.

30:03.435 --> 30:06.370
Don't know how
you survived that.

30:09.441 --> 30:13.143
Guess we did work
together pretty well.

30:13.145 --> 30:15.245
I guess so.

30:15.247 --> 30:16.513
Quick thinking on your part,

30:16.515 --> 30:19.283
counterbalancing
on the cable and all.

30:19.285 --> 30:20.517
How do you know physics
like that?

30:20.519 --> 30:22.319
Cheer squad.

30:22.321 --> 30:23.520
It was from one of our routines.

30:25.457 --> 30:27.925
I'm sorry.
It's okay.

30:27.927 --> 30:31.195
You don't sugarcoat things,
and the truth is

30:31.197 --> 30:32.429
I'm not as smart as you guys.

30:32.431 --> 30:34.398
That's not what
I'm sorry for.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.433
Clearly, we're all
smarter than you.

30:36.435 --> 30:39.903
Oh, okay.

30:39.905 --> 30:41.305
I'm sorry for letting you think
that was the reason

30:41.307 --> 30:43.207
I didn't want your help
with the wedding.

30:43.209 --> 30:45.309
That's not what I meant
by the "cheerleader" comment.

30:45.311 --> 30:47.411
Okay, so what did you mean?

30:47.413 --> 30:49.847
(sighs)

30:49.849 --> 30:52.616
Toby wants to invite half
of Brooklyn to the ceremony.

30:52.618 --> 30:54.184
He says he wants to show me off.

30:54.186 --> 30:56.320
He's proud he's marrying you.
He should be.

30:56.322 --> 30:58.255
I still don't know how
he pulled that off.

30:58.257 --> 31:00.357
The thing is,

31:00.359 --> 31:03.493
I'm not comfortable with being

31:03.495 --> 31:06.363
the center of attention
for this kind of thing.

31:06.365 --> 31:07.965
You know, you want
to hear a lecture

31:07.967 --> 31:10.367
on combustion engines, fine,
all eyes on me.

31:10.369 --> 31:12.502
But certain things are

31:12.504 --> 31:14.972
expected of a bride,

31:14.974 --> 31:17.341
and I do not fulfill
those expectations.

31:17.343 --> 31:20.410
Happy, you are beautiful.

31:20.412 --> 31:21.945
You're stunning.

31:21.947 --> 31:23.914
I am not now,
nor have I ever been

31:23.916 --> 31:25.415
a "girlie" kind of girl.

31:25.417 --> 31:28.919
When I was a kid, my
tools were taken away

31:28.921 --> 31:30.420
and replaced with dolls.

31:30.422 --> 31:32.656
I hate dolls.
Hate being dolled up.

31:32.658 --> 31:35.492
My least-favorite
first lady, Dolly Madison.

31:35.494 --> 31:36.526
(chuckles)

31:38.497 --> 31:41.498
I tried dresses and makeup,
but it's not me.

31:41.500 --> 31:44.167
I don't want to
disappoint Toby.

31:44.169 --> 31:46.303
This big wedding is
important to him,

31:46.305 --> 31:51.341
and meeting his family
is stressful enough.

31:51.343 --> 31:54.511
Doing it while I'm pretending
to be something I'm not...

31:54.513 --> 31:56.413
Happy, I just wanted to
make things easier for you.

31:56.415 --> 31:59.149
I couldn't care less if we were
picking out a Vera Wang

31:59.151 --> 32:00.617
or a Black & Decker.

32:00.619 --> 32:02.486
I know Toby could
care less, too.

32:02.488 --> 32:06.490
'Cause that wing nut is
crazy in love with you.

32:06.492 --> 32:07.991
Look at him.

32:10.462 --> 32:12.462
What did I get myself into?

32:12.464 --> 32:13.997
A wedding.

32:13.999 --> 32:15.565
And I'm not gonna
offer my help anymore.

32:15.567 --> 32:16.533
I don't want to add
any more stress.

32:16.535 --> 32:17.534
But know I'm here,

32:17.536 --> 32:18.635
if you need me,

32:18.637 --> 32:20.137
'cause we're friends...

32:20.139 --> 32:22.506
ish.

32:27.346 --> 32:31.214
Hey, Hap, I got an e-mail
from Harbor Oaks Catering.

32:31.216 --> 32:32.716
It's a nice venue,
affordable.

32:32.718 --> 32:35.218
Dance floor's big enough
to accommodate my sexy moves,

32:35.220 --> 32:36.486
so I'm gonna give 'em
a ring tomorrow.

32:36.488 --> 32:37.621
WALTER:
Speaking of "ring,"

32:37.623 --> 32:40.524
an under-looked
but integral job

32:40.526 --> 32:42.359
of the best man is
the presentation

32:42.361 --> 32:43.427
of the wedding ring.

32:43.429 --> 32:47.397
Now, the hand holding
that ring

32:47.399 --> 32:50.434
will be featured
in your photos forever.

32:50.436 --> 32:53.704
So you can have Cabe's
gnarled, battle-worn digits

32:53.706 --> 32:56.440
or Sly's fingers,
ravaged by

32:56.442 --> 32:58.241
millions of comic book-induced
paper cuts,

32:58.243 --> 33:02.212
or... these.

33:02.214 --> 33:03.347
They're supple.

33:03.349 --> 33:05.482
Nary a scar.

33:05.484 --> 33:07.484
Used for nothing,
apart from the occasional code.

33:07.486 --> 33:09.186
CABE:
In other words, soft.

33:09.188 --> 33:12.322
Toby, what you want
are a man's hands.

33:12.324 --> 33:14.358
I don't think you know
how that sounds.

33:14.360 --> 33:17.227
You want someone
who can handle a ring.

33:17.229 --> 33:19.162
I'm the only one here

33:19.164 --> 33:21.698
who has been bestowed
the Ring of the Falconer.

33:21.700 --> 33:23.300
How much jewelry
do you guys hand out?

33:23.302 --> 33:24.568
Plenty.

33:24.570 --> 33:26.370
All right, this is
ridiculous, Toby.

33:26.372 --> 33:28.005
You got three candidates.

33:28.007 --> 33:31.141
We're all capable,
all interested.

33:31.143 --> 33:32.609
But you refuse to choose.

33:32.611 --> 33:34.277
Yeah, you know what?
I think...

33:34.279 --> 33:36.246
I think this is
a power trip for you.

33:36.248 --> 33:37.648
All right, all right,
that's it, if the only way

33:37.649 --> 33:39.049
I can end this madness
is to actually pick someone

33:39.051 --> 33:40.584
to stand up for me
on my big day,

33:40.586 --> 33:42.085
I'm gonna do it.

33:42.087 --> 33:44.755
Because, listen, I...
I want the real deal.

33:44.757 --> 33:47.457
I want someone
who's always dependable.

33:48.761 --> 33:51.294
Someone who can adapt
when things get hairy.

33:51.296 --> 33:53.330
I want someone

33:53.332 --> 33:54.598
who comes up
with solutions

33:54.600 --> 33:55.799
when it seems
there are none.

33:57.536 --> 34:02.406
I want someone who,
in short, is sharp as a tack.

34:02.408 --> 34:05.642
So...

34:05.644 --> 34:08.745
I don't want a best man.

34:11.116 --> 34:13.650
I want a best ma'am.

34:14.553 --> 34:16.720
Paige, if it wasn't for you

34:16.722 --> 34:18.455
on that cable today,

34:18.457 --> 34:19.823
I wouldn't have
a Happy to marry.

34:23.095 --> 34:24.661
Will you please
do me this honor?

34:28.534 --> 34:30.200
I'd love to be your best ma'am.

34:31.637 --> 34:32.636
HAPPY:
You got to be kidding.

34:32.638 --> 34:35.472
We made up at the ambulance.

34:35.474 --> 34:37.174
I was going to ask her.

34:37.176 --> 34:38.608
You snooze, you lose.

34:43.215 --> 34:44.848
Okay, fine.

34:44.850 --> 34:47.150
Yes, the competition
is back on!

34:47.152 --> 34:49.252
I'm gonna be the
best maid of honor.

34:49.254 --> 34:50.587
Like hell you will.

34:50.589 --> 34:52.222
No. No competition.

34:52.224 --> 34:54.391
I am not going
through what Toby did,

34:54.393 --> 34:55.792
so I choose all three.

34:55.794 --> 34:58.395
Equal rank,
equal titles.

34:58.397 --> 34:59.729
My "dudes of honor."

34:59.731 --> 35:01.164
You can't do that.

35:01.165 --> 35:02.598
It's my wedding,
I can do whatever I want.

35:02.601 --> 35:06.103
Now, dudes...

35:06.105 --> 35:07.270
time to get cracking

35:07.272 --> 35:08.505
on this to-do list.

35:08.507 --> 35:11.508
Oh, I can't now. I have tons
of D.O.E. paperwork.

35:11.510 --> 35:12.576
Perhaps tomorrow?

35:12.578 --> 35:15.345
And, uh, I'd love
to stay and help,

35:15.347 --> 35:17.414
but I've got
Fantasies and Frolics tonight.

35:17.416 --> 35:18.715
In fact, I better hurry.

35:22.588 --> 35:24.154
Okay...

35:24.156 --> 35:26.323
I'm gonna catch the bus.

35:28.360 --> 35:31.761
I got time to take a stab
at that to-do list with you.

35:31.763 --> 35:32.696
The night's wide open.

35:32.698 --> 35:34.331
No, it's not,

35:34.333 --> 35:35.765
'cause you're gonna go play

35:35.767 --> 35:37.701
with Sly and
the putz-around gang.

35:37.703 --> 35:40.504
No, I told Sly I can't make it.

35:40.506 --> 35:41.771
You never said
you couldn't make it,

35:41.773 --> 35:43.240
you said you didn't
want to go,

35:43.242 --> 35:44.274
and broke his dork heart.

35:44.276 --> 35:47.144
No, I didn't.

35:48.413 --> 35:49.746
He just wanted
to pay me back

35:49.748 --> 35:52.249
for helping save
his clubhouse.

35:52.251 --> 35:55.652
He-He didn't have to do that.
I was glad to do it.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.721
He's not trying to pay you back.

35:57.723 --> 35:59.222
He's trying to be
your friend, dummy.

35:59.224 --> 36:01.925
Sometimes if someone
is your friend,

36:01.927 --> 36:03.894
you let them do stuff for you,

36:03.896 --> 36:06.663
like give you a cloak
or help plan a wedding,

36:06.665 --> 36:08.198
even if you don't want it.

36:08.199 --> 36:09.732
'Cause it's not about you,
it's about them,

36:09.735 --> 36:11.935
and them feeling good
about being a good friend.

36:11.937 --> 36:14.638
Or something like that.
I don't know.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.773
I'm a genius. I am new
to this feeling stuff.

36:16.775 --> 36:18.475
Like it or not,

36:18.477 --> 36:19.776
you have a funny way

36:19.778 --> 36:21.211
of growing on people, old man.

36:21.213 --> 36:23.547
Sly got close to you
during the campaign,

36:23.549 --> 36:25.599
and now that it's over,
he's scared.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.650
It's the same way I felt when
you moved out of my apartment.

36:27.653 --> 36:28.885
Really?
Sure.

36:28.887 --> 36:30.453
You're like a raccoon

36:30.455 --> 36:32.689
digging through
someone's garbage.

36:32.691 --> 36:34.491
You wonder how the hell
it got into your life,

36:34.493 --> 36:37.861
but once it's gone,
you kind of miss it.

36:43.535 --> 36:44.601
Huh.

36:44.603 --> 36:45.835
♪ Having your good kind
of love ♪

36:45.837 --> 36:48.905
♪ Hey, come back home to me... ♪

36:51.210 --> 36:52.509
Oh.

36:52.511 --> 36:54.377
Your Department
of Energy friend

36:54.379 --> 36:56.213
has got you doing
paperwork, too?

36:56.215 --> 36:57.414
Uh, no, I took
a little break.

36:57.416 --> 36:58.815
Actually, I'm trying
to get a jump start

36:58.817 --> 37:01.418
on all these best ma'am
responsibilities.

37:01.420 --> 37:02.819
Planning a stag
party is a little

37:02.821 --> 37:04.821
out of my area
of expertise.

37:04.822 --> 37:06.822
Plus, this is not exactly
speeding up the process.

37:06.825 --> 37:08.658
Yes, I've also been cramming

37:08.660 --> 37:10.527
on best-man research
lately, all for naught.

37:10.529 --> 37:12.329
Like, I could
lend you a hand.

37:12.331 --> 37:14.798
Literally and metaphorically.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.866
Oh, yeah, that sounds good.

37:16.868 --> 37:17.867
Perhaps I can help you
prepare for your

37:17.869 --> 37:19.869
dude-of-honor stint.

37:19.871 --> 37:23.640
We've got a lot to put together
over a few short weeks.

37:24.910 --> 37:27.244
Wedding partners in crime?
Deal.

37:28.013 --> 37:29.846
It might require
a few late nights

37:29.848 --> 37:31.448
and, uh, some weekends.

37:31.450 --> 37:32.749
Whatever it takes.

37:32.751 --> 37:35.552
I do not need
Happy Quinn mad at me.
(chuckles)

37:35.554 --> 37:37.954
All right, well,
let's get to work.

37:43.795 --> 37:45.862
Come on, you 20-sided mistress.

37:45.864 --> 37:47.998
Sylvester needs
a new set of wands.

37:50.035 --> 37:52.402
Ho!

37:52.404 --> 37:54.004
Ooh, a bravery spell.

37:54.006 --> 37:56.906
Hey, Dyfrost,
you can buy this from me

37:56.908 --> 37:58.842
and use it to stand up
to your mother.

37:58.844 --> 38:01.711
The woman is a tyrant.

38:01.713 --> 38:03.480
Here we go.

38:03.482 --> 38:05.882
Boys, let's feed the dragon.

38:05.884 --> 38:07.550
Hoo...

38:14.726 --> 38:17.694
Holy crap, it's Thor.

38:17.696 --> 38:19.863
I'm Magnus Gallo.

38:19.865 --> 38:22.832
I understand there's
a knighthood waiting for me.

38:22.834 --> 38:24.934
Of course.

38:24.936 --> 38:26.936
If you'll just kneel.

38:26.938 --> 38:28.805
That's not gonna happen.

38:28.807 --> 38:31.941
SYLVESTER: Guys, we can just
forego the ceremony

38:31.943 --> 38:33.510
and introduce him
to the game, right?

38:38.884 --> 38:40.684
You came.

38:40.686 --> 38:42.719
Sure I did, kid.

38:42.721 --> 38:44.888
Couldn't let my friend
go into battle without me.

38:46.958 --> 38:49.092
You guys have anything stronger
than a Dr. Shazz

38:49.094 --> 38:50.827
in that mini-fridge?

38:50.829 --> 38:52.562
We have a wine cooler.

38:52.564 --> 38:54.497
Don't drink that.
That's eight years old.

38:54.499 --> 38:57.867
But it is your roll.

38:57.869 --> 38:59.569
What the hell kind
of die is this?

39:03.842 --> 39:05.975
(chuckles)
Huzzah!

39:05.977 --> 39:07.377
Now, which one am I?

39:07.379 --> 39:08.845
You're the... you're
the girl in red.

39:08.847 --> 39:11.381
I know, I know, just...

39:11.383 --> 39:13.883
CABE:<i> I'd like to roll again,</i>
<i> if you don't mind.</i>
