WEBVTT

00:04.703 --> 00:06.736
Uh, Headmare Twilight?

00:06.824 --> 00:09.152
Sorry to bug you in
the teachers' lounge.

00:09.838 --> 00:12.205
Is it OK if I miss class?

00:12.293 --> 00:14.048
Mm hm. You can make
it up tomorrow.

00:14.136 --> 00:16.200
Actually, I'll be
gone for a week.

00:16.381 --> 00:18.957
A week? In the middle
of the semester?

00:19.045 --> 00:21.694
Oh! Is everything
all right, Smolder?

00:21.833 --> 00:23.073
Not exactly.

00:24.265 --> 00:25.615
My brother's been
having a hard time

00:25.702 --> 00:26.932
since I left for school.

00:27.020 --> 00:28.528
I want to go home
and check on him.

00:28.616 --> 00:29.847
He's a really sweet guy,

00:29.935 --> 00:31.693
and the other dragons
can be kinda rough.

00:31.781 --> 00:34.472
Did you say sweet guy and
dragon in the same sentence?

00:34.560 --> 00:36.676
Yeah. He's sorta
like you, Spike.

00:36.763 --> 00:38.021
Aww!

00:38.432 --> 00:40.591
I'm sorry to hear about
your brother, Smolder.

00:40.679 --> 00:43.661
But the Dragonlands are really
far for you to go by yourself,

00:43.749 --> 00:46.565
and I'm not sure about you
missing so much class.

00:46.684 --> 00:48.833
Hey! What if she got
school credit for it?

00:48.975 --> 00:52.325
Kind of like a... Kindness
field trip! I'll go with her!

00:52.533 --> 00:56.323
Thanks! The Dragonlord is way
too busy for personal problems

00:56.411 --> 00:58.372
when it's baby-dragon-
hatching season.

00:58.484 --> 01:01.489
Baby-dragon-hatching season?

01:01.577 --> 01:05.175
All those cute little
snouts poking out of those

01:05.263 --> 01:09.068
adorable little shells?
Teeny tiny twitchy tails.

01:09.161 --> 01:11.364
Can I go too?

01:11.505 --> 01:15.802
Well, you are the perfect pony
to lead a kindness field trip.

01:19.016 --> 01:21.839
Fine. But I'm going to
expect a full report

01:21.927 --> 01:24.044
- when you get back!
- How many pages?

01:24.132 --> 01:25.957
I was talking
to Fluttershy.

01:26.045 --> 01:28.327
Hatching season
sounds fascinating!

OK, I made a list of what
cheers me up when I'm down,

02:12.554 --> 02:14.678
so if your brother's like
me, he's gonna love it!

02:14.766 --> 02:16.841
What should we do
first: the "smile" song,

02:16.929 --> 02:19.412
the sharing circle, or
friendship bracelet weaving?

02:19.500 --> 02:21.316
I'm not sure those
are the kind of things

02:21.404 --> 02:22.862
my brother's gonna be into.

02:22.950 --> 02:25.700
Well, what would make
your brother happy?

02:25.788 --> 02:28.370
Just having Spike and me
accept him for who he is

02:28.458 --> 02:29.967
will make a huge difference.

02:30.060 --> 02:33.365
Dragons who appreciate
his more sensitive side.

02:33.479 --> 02:35.357
I got it! Showtunes!

02:35.548 --> 02:37.021
Yeah, no. But
good try.

02:38.638 --> 02:41.821
Oh! Um, that's an
interesting smell.

02:43.294 --> 02:47.711
Ah. The stink of sulfur,
sharp rocks under my claws.

02:48.287 --> 02:49.748
It's good to be home.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.884
I can't wait to meet
your brother, Smolder.

02:52.032 --> 02:54.138
We're gonna be best
buddies, I just know it.

02:54.226 --> 02:57.107
He usually hangs out near
here. I'll go try and find him.

02:59.572 --> 03:01.511
Spike, do you mind
if I take a peek

03:01.599 --> 03:03.349
at the cute
little baby eggs?

03:03.437 --> 03:06.269
No problem! I'll stay here and
finish this comfort blanket.

03:06.357 --> 03:07.827
It'll be like a hug

03:07.914 --> 03:11.097
every time Smolder's brother
wraps it around himself.

03:11.287 --> 03:14.533
Aw, I'm sure he'll
love it, Spike.

03:22.397 --> 03:25.529
Oh, my goodness!

03:27.810 --> 03:32.494
Good morning, little one.
I've come a long way to meet you.

03:32.582 --> 03:35.058
Did you know there's a
whole wide world out here

03:35.146 --> 03:39.511
waiting to say hello?
Did you? Oh, did you boo?

03:39.599 --> 03:41.646
It can't answer
you. It's an egg.

03:41.734 --> 03:44.617
Oh! Dragonlord Ember,
how nice to see you.

03:44.756 --> 03:48.939
Nice to see you too, uh
which one are you again?

03:49.121 --> 03:52.071
The party one? Apple Dash?
Or was that the country one?

03:52.158 --> 03:55.875
Fluttershy. The one
who loves creatures.

03:56.076 --> 03:58.744
Are all these yours?

03:58.831 --> 04:01.396
WHAT? No! None
of them are.

04:01.484 --> 04:04.246
Watching over eggs is just
part of the glamorous life

04:04.334 --> 04:05.771
of a Dragonlord.

04:06.072 --> 04:08.521
I think it sounds wonderful.

04:08.608 --> 04:11.190
Yeah? Then maybe
you can help.

04:11.295 --> 04:14.146
I'd love to! Just
tell me what to do.

04:14.306 --> 04:17.545
I don't know! It's my
first time being in charge.

04:17.640 --> 04:19.831
Dad wasn't big on sharing
Dragonlord details.

04:19.918 --> 04:22.365
It's kind of a burn
or be burned job.

04:22.453 --> 04:25.035
Well, I'm sure
you're doing great!

04:25.191 --> 04:28.113
Not really. The eggs should
have hatched by now...

04:28.201 --> 04:30.185
But none of them
have even cracked.

04:30.273 --> 04:33.881
Oh, dear. Maybe
they're lonely.

04:34.420 --> 04:37.381
Don't you worry. Auntie
Fluttershy's here.

04:37.469 --> 04:40.303
And the Dragonlord and I are
going to do everything we can

04:40.391 --> 04:42.545
to welcome you into this world!

04:42.675 --> 04:44.386
Really? How?

04:44.474 --> 04:46.443
Um. I have no idea.

04:49.136 --> 04:50.951
Now that's a thing of beauty.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.693
Whoa!

04:54.987 --> 04:58.482
Well, if it isn't our
little pony-friend, Spike.

04:58.717 --> 05:01.160
That's Equestria's Official
Friendship Ambassador

05:01.248 --> 05:02.857
to the Dragonlands to you.

05:02.945 --> 05:06.045
And I'm not little.
I had the molt, see?

05:08.301 --> 05:12.935
Ooh, runt's got wings!
I'm so impressed.

05:13.039 --> 05:14.623
What's that supposed to be?

05:14.746 --> 05:16.079
Nothing.

05:16.529 --> 05:17.732
Agh!

05:17.820 --> 05:21.435
Looks like a...
baby blanket to me.

05:21.523 --> 05:25.615
It's not a baby blanket!
It's a... comfort blanket.

05:28.836 --> 05:31.870
Aww... Did your pony
pals make it for you

05:31.958 --> 05:34.573
with friendship and gumdrops?

05:34.660 --> 05:36.568
No... I made it.

05:36.656 --> 05:39.217
And by the way, knitting is
a lot harder than it looks.

05:39.331 --> 05:41.428
Check out the baby
blanket, guys!

05:41.516 --> 05:43.617
It's a lot harder
than it looks!

05:44.800 --> 05:46.917
Got your bwankie.

05:47.169 --> 05:49.799
Aw, the little baby crying.

05:49.887 --> 05:51.153
Whoa, miss!

05:52.979 --> 05:56.695
Bet he broke a claw
and everything!

05:56.782 --> 05:58.998
Give it back! That's
for my friend.

06:01.221 --> 06:02.224
Cut it out!

06:02.312 --> 06:04.136
You know laugh-fire is
dangerous! It can...

06:06.158 --> 06:07.206
Do that.

06:07.293 --> 06:08.364
Garble!

06:08.452 --> 06:09.482
Smolder?

06:09.570 --> 06:11.327
What are you doing here?

06:14.421 --> 06:15.988
How's it scalin', bra?

06:17.576 --> 06:19.958
We'd better get out of here
before your brother shows up.

06:20.139 --> 06:22.788
Garble isn't very nice
to sensitive dragons.

06:22.875 --> 06:25.695
But... Garble
IS my brother.

06:25.783 --> 06:27.187
Your brother?

06:27.275 --> 06:30.296
Got a problem with
that, ponyboy?

06:30.787 --> 06:32.350
Oh, brother.

06:37.701 --> 06:41.118
I've missed you, bro!
We got a lot of fun to catch up on.

06:41.237 --> 06:43.155
There's no lava
diving at school.

06:43.295 --> 06:45.827
<i>Good luck getting
Garble to do anything.</i>

06:45.915 --> 06:48.919
Yeah, he's been so
weird since you left.

06:49.007 --> 06:51.294
Hiding, and
moping around.

06:51.382 --> 06:52.591
I have not!

06:52.679 --> 06:53.819
Have so!

06:53.906 --> 06:56.372
Easy, guys. I learned
at Twilight's school,

06:56.460 --> 06:59.325
ganging up on each other isn't
half as cool as you think.

06:59.412 --> 07:03.101
Aw, Pony school made you soft.

07:03.189 --> 07:05.437
Wanna try me and find out?

07:06.117 --> 07:07.507
Maybe later.

07:07.595 --> 07:10.898
So... Let's get lava
diving! Whaddya say?

07:11.023 --> 07:12.999
Better stay here, shrimp.

07:13.125 --> 07:16.530
Lava might ruin your
blankie-wankie.

07:16.658 --> 07:17.906
Let the wimp tag along.

07:18.187 --> 07:20.779
Then we'll have
somedragon to dunk!

07:20.866 --> 07:25.184
Only gonna warn you
once. Spike's my friend.

07:25.271 --> 07:27.645
You mess with him,
you mess with me.

07:27.795 --> 07:31.192
Besides, he came here to
hang out with YOU, Garble.

07:34.645 --> 07:37.505
Aw, how sweet.

07:37.593 --> 07:39.775
Let's go do dragon stuff.

07:40.019 --> 07:43.270
Garble can have fun
with his new friend.

07:47.335 --> 07:50.403
But I'm not having fun!
And he's not my friend!

07:51.647 --> 07:53.795
Just ignore them, GarGar.

07:54.066 --> 07:56.426
Smolder! Not in public!

07:56.610 --> 07:58.425
Oh, it's OK to
have a nickname!

07:58.614 --> 08:00.863
Sometimes I'm
called Spikey Wikey.

08:01.083 --> 08:03.637
Seriously?
You're admitting this?

08:03.801 --> 08:05.606
I am not hanging
out with him.

08:05.694 --> 08:09.091
Give him a chance, Garble.
You guys have a lot in common.

08:10.091 --> 08:12.841
Fine. Race you to the Lava Pit.

08:13.085 --> 08:16.458
Wait! I thought you said
your brother was sweet.

08:16.546 --> 08:18.770
All the tough guy
stuff is just an act.

08:18.858 --> 08:20.520
He's a big marshmallow.

08:20.695 --> 08:22.073
Yeah. Not seeing it.

08:22.161 --> 08:24.598
Well, maybe a
burned marshmallow.

08:24.686 --> 08:27.598
Smoky on the outside,
but squishy inside.

08:27.686 --> 08:30.081
He just needs friends who
can appreciate that part.

08:30.169 --> 08:31.505
Like you.

08:31.593 --> 08:33.331
You're not
changing your mind

08:33.419 --> 08:35.472
about helping me
cheer him up, are you?

08:35.597 --> 08:37.207
Me? 'Course not.

08:41.765 --> 08:45.517
OK! Lava jumping, just
like old times, huh GarGar?

08:45.605 --> 08:47.365
Yeah. Just like old times.

08:47.453 --> 08:50.798
Except for one little,
annoying thing.

08:51.267 --> 08:53.372
Scales away!

08:55.027 --> 08:57.478
Come on in! The lava's fine!

08:59.198 --> 09:01.835
Ya know, whenever I'm
feeling a little down,

09:01.923 --> 09:04.164
it always helps if I do
something with a friend.

09:04.252 --> 09:06.853
How about we jump together?

09:07.814 --> 09:08.921
Agh!

09:11.043 --> 09:15.337
Oh. Spike? You OK?

09:16.250 --> 09:19.330
I know there must be something
worse than lava up your nose.

09:19.418 --> 09:22.830
Ah ah ah ahchoo!

09:23.357 --> 09:25.423
I just don't know it is.

09:25.511 --> 09:27.744
CANNON BALL!

09:29.755 --> 09:32.126
Woohoo! Ha ha ha!

09:32.699 --> 09:34.189
Oops!

09:39.505 --> 09:44.009
SWALLOWING lava.
Swallowing lava is definitely worse.

09:44.844 --> 09:46.423
My bad.

09:49.399 --> 09:53.611
And then they all lived
happily ever after!

09:53.919 --> 09:56.301
Time to come out, little ones.

10:02.194 --> 10:04.595
Maybe you'd like a song?

10:04.790 --> 10:07.806
I think you might be
encouraging them to stay in.

10:08.025 --> 10:10.673
Dragons aren't much for
touchy-feely stuff.

10:11.070 --> 10:12.890
Oh. I'm sorry.

10:13.973 --> 10:16.488
Goodness! Why are
the eggs shaking?

10:16.575 --> 10:18.557
Are they finally hatching?

10:18.644 --> 10:21.293
I wish. They've been
doing that for days.

10:21.380 --> 10:24.330
I'm sure it means something.
But it's probably not good.

10:25.434 --> 10:27.816
Try this. Red velvet.

10:27.904 --> 10:30.181
Guaranteed to brighten
anycreature's spirits!

10:32.124 --> 10:34.267
Feeling better already.

10:36.233 --> 10:38.634
I don't know about you,
but a change of scenery

10:38.722 --> 10:40.896
always turns my
frown upside down.

10:40.999 --> 10:42.413
AAh!

10:46.052 --> 10:48.300
I will be the bigger dragon.
I will be the bigger dragon.

10:48.388 --> 10:50.790
I will be the bigger dragon.
I will be the bigger dragon.

10:50.878 --> 10:54.345
Sometimes just hearing what
someone appreciates about you

10:54.433 --> 10:56.515
can make you feel
better about yourself.

10:56.615 --> 10:58.236
I'll go first.

10:58.450 --> 11:01.400
Spike, I think
it's really nice

11:01.487 --> 11:03.744
that you're trying
to cheer up GarGar.

11:03.832 --> 11:04.880
Aw!

11:04.968 --> 11:07.259
Thank you, Smolder.
My turn.

11:07.707 --> 11:10.007
I like how you always
let everycreature know

11:10.095 --> 11:11.744
how you're feeling, GarGar.

11:12.049 --> 11:14.865
ONLY SMOLDER GETS
TO CALL ME THAT!

11:16.302 --> 11:18.470
Thank you for
speaking your truth.

11:20.947 --> 11:23.954
More fresh lava, comin' up!

11:25.000 --> 11:31.074

11:32.151 --> 11:35.133
OK, NEW activity. Who wants
to make vision boards?

11:35.220 --> 11:38.923
Hey, Garble! Smolder! Surf's up!

11:43.162 --> 11:45.129
Let me show you how it's done!

11:47.299 --> 11:48.480
You coming?

11:48.567 --> 11:50.881
I'll catch up with you.

11:55.607 --> 11:58.223
Spike! There
you are!

11:58.310 --> 11:59.552
Hey, Fluttershy.

11:59.656 --> 12:01.070
For a land that's
all rocks,

12:01.158 --> 12:03.941
this place is surprisingly
easy to get lost in.

12:04.083 --> 12:05.825
How are the baby dragons doing?

12:05.913 --> 12:09.433
The eggs won't hatch!
They just keep shaking.

12:09.521 --> 12:11.880
I'm starting to think the
dragons are too scared

12:11.968 --> 12:15.051
to come out. I was
hoping you could help...

12:15.194 --> 12:16.589
If you're not too busy

12:16.677 --> 12:18.395
cheering up Smolder's brother.

12:18.483 --> 12:22.599
Not a chance. Smolder's
brother is GARBLE.

12:22.768 --> 12:26.153
The only thing that cheers him
up is to make me miserable.

12:26.241 --> 12:29.565
Hey, Spike! Wanna
play lava ball?

12:32.800 --> 12:36.846
Excuse me. But that's
not a very nice game.

12:40.718 --> 12:43.134
Ah, nearly got you!

12:43.245 --> 12:45.089
ENOUGH!

12:47.049 --> 12:50.587
Ahem! I mean, leave my
friend alone, please.

12:50.721 --> 12:53.312
Spike came all this
way to cheer up Garble,

12:53.399 --> 12:55.987
which was a very
kind thing to do.

12:56.301 --> 12:58.688
Aw, do you need
cheering up?

12:58.776 --> 13:00.452
What's wrong, Garble?

13:00.539 --> 13:04.588
Did somedragon hurt
your wittle feewings?

13:04.684 --> 13:07.479
No! I don't know what
she's talking about.

13:07.646 --> 13:09.328
Spike's the one who's gonna cry!

13:09.415 --> 13:12.597
HEY! Are we lava
surfing or what?

13:12.684 --> 13:15.701
Yeah! Yeah! Let's go
hang with a REAL dragon.

13:15.788 --> 13:17.521
Not a pony wanna-be!

13:19.030 --> 13:21.452
See? It's no use.

13:23.462 --> 13:25.600
Why don't I see what I
can do about the eggs,

13:25.688 --> 13:29.092
and you cheer up Garble.
At least he listens to you.

13:29.450 --> 13:33.534
Just you wait, Garble.
You're dealing with Fluttershy now.

13:33.637 --> 13:37.444
And she's packing a whole
lifetime of kindness.

13:40.512 --> 13:43.500
Koochie koochie koo.
Koochie koochie koo...

13:43.615 --> 13:51.136
koochie! Koochie koochie
koo. Koochie!

13:51.223 --> 13:53.219
Uh, what are you doing?

13:53.307 --> 13:54.389
SPIKE!

13:54.486 --> 13:55.707
Hi Ember!

13:55.794 --> 13:57.789
Shouldn't you be doing
whatever it is you do

13:57.877 --> 13:59.344
at Twilight's school?

13:59.431 --> 14:02.213
I wish. It's a long story.

14:02.361 --> 14:05.262
Wow. These eggs
really do look scared.

14:08.996 --> 14:12.112
Wait, aren't the hatching
grounds supposed to be hot?

14:12.200 --> 14:15.408
Of course! There's a lake
of molten lava under them.

14:15.613 --> 14:17.072
That's why the
eggs are laid here;

14:17.197 --> 14:18.663
the heat makes them hatch!

14:18.783 --> 14:20.076
Then something's wrong.

14:20.164 --> 14:21.500
I don't think the
eggs are shaking

14:21.595 --> 14:23.768
'cause they're afraid.
They're cold.

14:26.425 --> 14:29.432
You're right!
But what happened to the lava?

14:30.432 --> 14:32.221
I might have an idea.

14:33.357 --> 14:38.282
Garble? Smolder?
Is any dragon there?

14:40.172 --> 14:44.580
Oh, my. Are those...
bongo drums?

14:44.668 --> 14:50.787
Fire, dragon, wig and wagon...
Feelin' like I be saggin'...

14:50.875 --> 14:53.275
Oh, yeah, I dig!

14:56.095 --> 14:58.997
Ragin' lava, balaclava...

14:59.861 --> 15:01.353
Huh?

15:04.807 --> 15:07.156
Fresh lava coming up.

15:15.440 --> 15:17.673
See?

15:17.910 --> 15:19.728
I wondered where that
lava was coming from.

15:19.816 --> 15:22.353
They must be draining it
from the underground lake!

15:25.785 --> 15:28.701
Put that rock back! Immediately!

15:29.037 --> 15:31.485
Uh, yes, Dragonlord Ember!

15:31.580 --> 15:34.728
How long have you been
removing these boulders?

15:35.527 --> 15:38.361
A while?

15:38.609 --> 15:42.876
It made our lava pools
so nice and warm-like.

15:42.964 --> 15:45.728
It's supposed to be
heating the eggs!

15:45.883 --> 15:48.127
Now they'll never hatch!

15:56.915 --> 15:58.619
Sorry, Dragonlord Ember!

15:58.707 --> 16:00.462
We'll put the lava back!

16:00.550 --> 16:06.370
Here you go, lava! Aw come
on! Don't you have to go!

16:06.458 --> 16:08.353
Faster!
It's liquidy!

16:08.441 --> 16:09.789
I don't think it works that way.

16:09.931 --> 16:11.572
The hatching grounds
can't be the only

16:11.660 --> 16:12.634
warm place in the Dragonlands.

16:12.722 --> 16:14.921
There's got to be somewhere
else we can take the eggs.

16:15.009 --> 16:16.547
You know how fragile
those things are?

16:16.635 --> 16:18.712
No way we'll be able to
move them all safely.

16:19.345 --> 16:21.752
YOU! Go and bring
all the dragons

16:21.840 --> 16:22.820
to the hatching grounds.

16:22.908 --> 16:24.642
We'll have to make
the heat ourselves.

16:27.545 --> 16:30.261
What do you think you're doing
sneaking around here, Pony?

16:30.349 --> 16:33.898
Sneaking? It looks to me like
the only one sneaking around

16:33.986 --> 16:38.170
is you, Garble. Why didn't
you tell me you were a poet?

16:38.287 --> 16:39.775
I'm not!

16:45.179 --> 16:51.198
<i>♪ Words, rhythm, sometimes
rhyme. Weird punctuation. ♪</i>

16:51.364 --> 16:54.014
Sure sounds like poetry to me.

16:54.273 --> 16:55.728
It's OK, GarGar.

16:55.907 --> 16:58.557
Fluttershy won't think you're
soft for being a poet.

16:58.644 --> 17:01.884
And neither would anydragon
who was your real friend.

17:03.080 --> 17:07.284
OK, fine. But I'm not a
flowery namby pamby poet.

17:07.419 --> 17:09.532
I'm a beat poet... dig?

17:09.688 --> 17:12.079
I totally feel you.

17:12.167 --> 17:14.275
And you better not tell
my friends about it.

17:14.392 --> 17:17.208
But... why? If I was a poet,

17:17.296 --> 17:19.978
I'd want to share my
creations with everypony.

17:20.065 --> 17:22.181
I'm the only one Garble
will perform for.

17:22.269 --> 17:24.663
He hasn't written any
poetry since I left.

17:24.751 --> 17:26.821
That's why he's been so sad.

17:27.790 --> 17:31.488
I NEED to create! But if the
other dragons ever found out

17:31.576 --> 17:34.900
I like this junk,
they'd make fun of me. Forever.

17:35.149 --> 17:37.369
Is that why you pick on Spike?

17:37.549 --> 17:39.931
To make your friends
think you're tough?

17:40.048 --> 17:43.126
Wait. You've been
picking on Spike?

17:43.301 --> 17:46.056
Only when you're not looking.

17:46.144 --> 17:49.060
But if I didn't pick on Spike,
they'd just pick on me.

17:49.328 --> 17:50.798
And he is kind of a weakling.

17:50.886 --> 17:54.439
Hmmph! I'll have you know Spike
is stronger than you are!

17:54.527 --> 17:55.726
Any day!

17:55.814 --> 17:58.109
Yeah, right. That
little cupcake-making,

17:58.197 --> 18:01.494
blanket-cuddling
pony-dragon? Gimmie a break.

18:01.973 --> 18:05.244
First of all, there's nothing
wrong with being a pony.

18:05.444 --> 18:08.493
Second, Spike isn't
afraid to be who he is,

18:08.580 --> 18:11.997
no matter what you...
or anycreature thinks.

18:12.084 --> 18:16.822
That's real strength...
Not like somedragons I know.

18:17.183 --> 18:20.626
For a pony without a horn,
she's sure got a point.

18:21.259 --> 18:22.974
I've been looking all
over for you guys.

18:23.061 --> 18:24.790
We need your
help! Hurry!

18:40.292 --> 18:42.619
I've ordered everydragon
to warm up the eggs,

18:42.748 --> 18:44.031
but they still won't hatch.

18:44.119 --> 18:45.861
I don't know what
else we can try.

18:45.949 --> 18:49.667
We can't give up! There's got
to be something we can do.

18:49.755 --> 18:54.806
How 'bout we wrap the eggs
in a bunch of baby blankets?

18:54.986 --> 18:59.212
Yeah! The wimp can knit
'em up real quick-like.

18:59.496 --> 19:02.665
Hey, watch it! That laugh-fire
could burn someponies!

19:08.383 --> 19:11.884
Burn! Good idea, Spikey Wikey.

19:14.138 --> 19:17.387
Eggs. Come. Burst
into that light.

19:17.749 --> 19:20.283
Break through
shells that... bind!

19:25.900 --> 19:27.605
Break free. Explore!

19:27.692 --> 19:32.837
Stuck between rock
and hard place!

19:45.551 --> 19:50.903
Freedom. Come. Don't be shy.
Look those others in the eye.

19:59.191 --> 20:02.783
Stake your claim.
Don't stop, just do!

20:02.947 --> 20:05.110
Be the one and only you!

20:07.599 --> 20:08.913
Spike, look.

20:12.137 --> 20:16.369
Their laugh-fire is so hot,
it's hatching the eggs!

20:16.457 --> 20:21.900
Come to light. Proud to be.
Open up! Bam! Be... FREE!

20:37.267 --> 20:38.743
You did it, GarGar!

20:38.830 --> 20:41.142
You performed in front
of other dragons!

20:41.230 --> 20:43.580
And it was SUPER-LAME.

20:43.735 --> 20:46.259
What kind of weakling
writes poetry?

20:48.006 --> 20:52.267
The hero of the
Dragonlands, that's who.

20:52.878 --> 20:56.127
Yeah! Garble saved our eggs
because he was strong enough

20:56.214 --> 20:58.978
to be who he is, whether
you liked it or not.

20:59.184 --> 21:02.567
I grew up thinking it was OK
to make fun of differences.

21:02.654 --> 21:05.705
But my friends have taught
me to celebrate them!

21:08.827 --> 21:11.320
And from now on, in my kingdom,

21:11.408 --> 21:13.878
that's exactly what we will do!

21:13.965 --> 21:15.680
Now, if you don't
mind, can you teach me

21:15.767 --> 21:18.119
how to write poetry like
that? It's pretty cool.

21:18.270 --> 21:21.353
Uh, yeah. Sure, no problem.

21:21.542 --> 21:23.023
Yeah, me too!

21:23.111 --> 21:24.814
I wanna learn!

21:24.908 --> 21:26.612
Take a number, guys.

21:26.794 --> 21:30.745
I'll take them all! Oh, my!
