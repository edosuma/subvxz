announcer:
IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:07.408 --> 00:11.279
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:11.312 --> 00:13.514
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:13.547 --> 00:15.483
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:15.516 --> 00:16.817
ARE MEMBERS OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:16.850 --> 00:19.120
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:19.153 --> 00:21.355
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:23.124 --> 00:25.126
- SO YOU'RE SURE THAT IT
WAS A DARK HOODIE, HUH?

00:25.159 --> 00:27.361
- UH-HUH.
- OKAY, WE'LL GET IN TOUCH

00:27.395 --> 00:29.263
WHEN WE NEED TO TALK TO YOU
AGAIN, OKAY?

00:29.297 --> 00:33.067
OKAY.

00:33.101 --> 00:36.204
- SO BROWN HAIR, IN HER 20s.
WE LOOKING AT VIC NUMBER FIVE?

00:36.237 --> 00:38.339
- HE PUSHED HER DOWN
FROM BEHIND,

00:38.372 --> 00:40.141
HE, UH, CUT A HANDFUL
OF HER HAIR,

00:40.174 --> 00:41.542
AND HE SAID, "YOU THINK
YOU'RE SPECIAL, BITCH?"

00:41.575 --> 00:42.576
- I BET SHE DIDN'T
GET A LOOK AT HIM

00:42.610 --> 00:44.178
WITH HER FACE
IN THE SIDEWALK.

00:44.212 --> 00:46.147
- SHE WAS DRUNK,
BUT SHE THINKS THAT HE'S WHITE,

00:46.180 --> 00:47.148
AND THAT HE WAS
WEARING A DARK HOODIE.

00:47.181 --> 00:48.182
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS

00:48.216 --> 00:49.417
WHERE WERE THESE LOOKY-LOOS
WHEN IT HAPPENED?

00:49.450 --> 00:50.484
- HOME IN THEIR LOFTS.

00:50.518 --> 00:52.586
WEST SOHO'S
A GHOST TOWN BY 11:00.

00:52.620 --> 00:55.389
- DETECTIVE, HAS THE WEST SOHO
RAPIST STRUCK AGAIN?

00:55.423 --> 00:57.125
DO YOU HAVE ANY LEADS?

00:57.158 --> 00:59.127
- WE ARE WORKING THE CASE, AND
OUR VICTIM IS OUR TOP PRIORITY.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.861
- SO THAT'S A NO?

01:00.894 --> 01:03.597
- NO, THAT IS A
"LET US DO OUR JOB."

01:03.631 --> 01:07.568
- ONCE AGAIN, THE NYPD IS
STYMIED BY THE WEST SOHO RAPIST.

01:07.601 --> 01:10.604
THE POLICE ARE STILL CLUELESS,
AND A FRIGHTENED NEIGHBORHOOD

01:10.638 --> 01:12.440
CAN ONLY WAIT AND WONDER
WHO WILL RESCUE THEM--

01:12.473 --> 01:15.209
- YOU CAN'T SKETCH
WHAT YOU DON'T SEE.

01:15.243 --> 01:17.445
- STILL NO PHONE CALLS?
NO WITNESSES?

01:17.478 --> 01:18.612
WHAT, IS THIS GUY
INVISIBLE?

01:18.646 --> 01:20.348
- THE ONLY NEARBY SUBWAY
IS THE 1 TRAIN.

01:20.381 --> 01:23.217
- OKAY, BUT HE COULD BE DRIVING.
HE'S NEAR THE HOLLAND TUNNEL.

01:23.251 --> 01:25.119
- WE'RE PULLING VIDEO,
CHECKING LICENSES,

01:25.153 --> 01:27.321
DOING STOP AND FRISKS
ON WHITE MALES.

01:27.355 --> 01:29.190
- THAT'S A NICE
CHANGE OF PACE.

01:29.223 --> 01:30.324
- TOO BAD
IT HASN'T HELPED.

01:30.358 --> 01:32.593
- SO WE FLOOD THE ZONE
AGAIN TONIGHT.

01:32.626 --> 01:34.195
COVER THE SUBWAY
AND TUNNEL.

01:34.228 --> 01:36.397
I WANT A NOOSE
AROUND THAT AREA.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.399
ANYBODY OUT ON THOSE STREETS
AFTER MIDNIGHT

01:38.432 --> 01:41.869
BETTER HAVE
AN NYPD PAY STUB ON 'EM.

01:41.902 --> 01:43.437
WHAT'RE YOU WAITING FOR?
A HUG GOOD-BYE?

01:43.471 --> 01:46.874
COME ON,
LET'S GET IT SET UP.

01:46.907 --> 01:48.576
UH, LIV.

01:48.609 --> 01:51.479
I, UH--I SAW
THE MORNING NEWS.

01:51.512 --> 01:53.381
AND SO DID
THE COMMISSIONER.

01:53.414 --> 01:56.150
- THAT BRITISH REPORTER GRISCOMB
WAS ALL OVER OUR ASSES.

01:56.184 --> 01:58.652
- AND YOU HANDLED HIM, WHICH
IS WHY YOU'RE COMING WITH ME

01:58.686 --> 02:01.355
TO A COMMUNITY COUNCIL MEETING;
DAMAGE CONTROL.

02:01.389 --> 02:02.890
- CAPTAIN, I'D RATHER
JUST STAY ON THE CASE.

02:02.923 --> 02:07.461
- NOT A REQUEST.

02:07.495 --> 02:09.663
WE ASK THAT YOU EXERCISE
EXTRA CAUTION.

02:09.697 --> 02:12.633
AVOID GOING OUT LATE ALONE.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.702
- SO THE RAPIST WINS?
[people chattering]

02:14.735 --> 02:18.439
THESE ARE OUR STREETS!
- YEAH!

02:18.472 --> 02:19.707
- JUST DON'T
MAKE IT EASY FOR HIM.

02:19.740 --> 02:22.476
- ARE YOU SAYING
WE'RE ASKING FOR IT?

02:22.510 --> 02:23.911
[angry chatter]

02:23.944 --> 02:25.913
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.
- SERIOUSLY.

02:25.946 --> 02:28.349
BLAMING THE VICTIMS?

02:28.382 --> 02:29.950
[chattered agreement]

02:29.983 --> 02:32.420
- THERE'S ONLY ONE MAN
THAT WE'RE BLAMING,

02:32.453 --> 02:35.423
AND THAT'S THE MAN WHO'S
COMMITTING THESE ATTACKS. OKAY?

02:35.456 --> 02:38.426
NOW, WE HAVE POSTED SURVEILLANCE
THROUGHOUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

02:38.459 --> 02:42.730
WE HAVE INCREASED
POLICE PRESENCE.

02:42.763 --> 02:45.266
NOW SOME OF THESE MEASURES
WILL BE VISIBLE,

02:45.299 --> 02:47.401
AND SOME WE WILL NOT DISCLOSE,

02:47.435 --> 02:50.271
SO THAT THE ATTACKER
CAN'T ANTICIPATE OUR METHODS.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.274
- WHATEVER IT IS
YOU'RE DOING,

02:53.307 --> 02:55.509
IT'S NOT PREVENTING
THESE ATTACKS.

02:55.543 --> 02:56.577
[chattered agreement]

02:56.610 --> 02:58.412
- PLEASE, PEOPLE, PLEASE.

02:58.446 --> 03:01.282
WE'RE DOING
EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN,

03:01.315 --> 03:04.552
BUT WE'RE ALSO
ASKING WOMEN TO STAY ALERT.

03:04.585 --> 03:07.755
AND I WILL PROMISE YOU

03:07.788 --> 03:11.392
WE WILL NOT STOP
UNTIL WE CATCH HIM.

03:11.425 --> 03:15.529
- [gasps]
- YOU'RE MINE, BITCH.

03:15.563 --> 03:18.766
- PLEASE, NO. AAH!

03:18.799 --> 03:21.469
- GET OFF OF HER!

03:25.739 --> 03:27.408
HEY! GET BACK HERE!

03:27.441 --> 03:31.545
- [panting, whimpering]

03:31.579 --> 03:34.548
[mellow rock]

03:34.582 --> 03:42.590
*

04:17.057 --> 04:18.326
- I'D SEEN THE STORIES.

04:18.359 --> 04:19.693
I SHOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN OUT ALONE.

04:19.727 --> 04:21.395
I HAD A FEW DRINKS.

04:21.429 --> 04:23.497
- IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT
THAT YOU WERE ATTACKED.

04:23.531 --> 04:27.601
- YOU HAVE TO SAY THAT,
RIGHT?

04:27.635 --> 04:30.571
- CLAIRE,
I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET.

04:30.604 --> 04:33.641
CAN YOU GO THROUGH WITH US
WHAT HAPPENED?

04:33.674 --> 04:35.376
- HE HAD A KNIFE.

04:35.409 --> 04:38.512
HE KNOCKED ME DOWN.

04:38.546 --> 04:39.680
HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY
RAPE ME,

04:39.713 --> 04:40.948
BECAUSE THIS OTHER GUY
STOPPED HIM.

04:40.981 --> 04:41.915
THAT'S WHO YOU
SHOULD BE TALKING TO.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.517
- OKAY, WE'LL GET TO HIM
IN JUST A MINUTE,

04:43.551 --> 04:45.085
BUT THE MAN
THAT ATTACKED YOU.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.320
DID YOU NOTICE
ANYTHING ELSE?

04:46.354 --> 04:49.357
HIS RACE, OR HIS CLOTHING?

04:49.390 --> 04:53.394
- HE WORE A DARK HOODIE.
A TAN CONSTRUCTION JACKET.

04:53.427 --> 04:55.596
HIS VOICE SOUNDED WHITE.

04:55.629 --> 04:56.597
- WELL,
WHAT DID HE SAY TO YOU?

04:56.630 --> 05:01.369
- "YOU'RE MINE, BITCH."

05:01.402 --> 05:04.705
- WELL, THIS OTHER GUY...
THE RESCUER?

05:04.738 --> 05:07.375
- HE WAS WEARING
THIS CRAZY GETUP.

05:07.408 --> 05:08.676
LIKE SOME
DOWNTOWN SUPERHERO.

05:08.709 --> 05:11.612
- HOLD ON,
HE WAS IN COSTUME?

05:11.645 --> 05:12.413
- YEAH.

05:12.446 --> 05:15.082
I THOUGHT I WAS
IMAGINING THINGS,

05:15.115 --> 05:16.650
BUT HE PUNCHED
THE RAPIST IN THE FACE

05:16.684 --> 05:17.585
AND CHASED AFTER HIM.

05:17.618 --> 05:19.420
- WELL, DID YOU SEE
WHICH WAY THEY RAN?

05:19.453 --> 05:21.489
- TOWARDS HOUSTON STREET.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.691
WHOEVER HE IS,

05:23.724 --> 05:27.495
HE REALLY IS A HERO.

05:27.528 --> 05:31.465
HE SAVED ME.

05:33.634 --> 05:35.969
- TERRIFIED DOWNTOWN RESIDENTS
WOKE THIS MORNING

05:36.003 --> 05:38.105
TO LEARN THAT
THE SOHO RAPIST

05:38.138 --> 05:41.375
HAS STRUCK FOR THE SIXTH TIME
IN AS MANY WEEKS.

05:41.409 --> 05:43.010
SOURCES TELL US--
- TURN THAT NOISE OFF.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.011
- A MYSTERIOUS HERO,
SAID TO BE WEARING BODY ARMOR--

05:44.044 --> 05:45.245
- SCREW HIM.

05:45.278 --> 05:49.082
I THOUGHT YOU AND ROLLINS WERE
LOOKING AT SECURITY CAM FOOTAGE.

05:49.116 --> 05:50.317
- ON IT, CAPTAIN.

05:50.350 --> 05:54.755
- IS ANYBODY ELSE WORKING THIS
CASE BESIDES THE MASKED AVENGER?

05:54.788 --> 05:56.724
- SAY WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT HIM,
BUT HE CLOCKED THE PERP SO HARD

05:56.757 --> 05:58.992
THAT HE LEFT BLOOD
AT THE CRIME SCENE.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.561
FIN'S LEANING ON WARNER.

06:00.594 --> 06:03.397
- ALL RIGHT, WE GOT SIX RAPES,
AND FINALLY A DNA HIT.

06:03.431 --> 06:04.398
THAT'S A START.

06:04.432 --> 06:05.999
- ASSUMING
HE'S OUR SERIAL.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.435
- HE FITS THE PROFILE.

06:07.468 --> 06:09.437
WE GOT A 3:00 a.m. ATTACK.

06:09.470 --> 06:11.772
THE VICTIM, CLAIRE GRANT,
IS BRUNETTE,

06:11.805 --> 06:13.774
HE PUSHED HER DOWN,
HE HAD A KNIFE.

06:13.807 --> 06:15.108
- ALL DETAILS
WE DIDN'T RELEASE.

06:15.142 --> 06:16.109
- NOT EXACTLY
THE MAGIC WORDS,

06:16.143 --> 06:17.377
BUT HE WAS CLOSE.

06:17.411 --> 06:19.079
"YOU'RE MINE, BITCH," INSTEAD
OF, "YOU THINK YOU'RE SPECIAL."

06:19.112 --> 06:20.614
- DID HE CUT HER HAIR?

06:20.648 --> 06:23.016
- HE DIDN'T HAVE TIME.
HE WAS INTERRUPTED.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.018
- DNA HIT ASIDE,
WE DON'T NEED VIGILANTES

06:25.052 --> 06:26.754
DOING OUR JOB,
SO WHERE ARE WE ON THAT?

06:26.787 --> 06:28.121
- THERE'S NO SIGN
OF HIM ON VIDEO,

06:28.155 --> 06:30.157
BUT TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

06:30.190 --> 06:34.828
IT'S FOOTAGE
FROM THE HOUSTON STREET IRT.

06:34.862 --> 06:37.598
IT'S 3:16 a.m.

06:37.631 --> 06:39.733
- TAN JACKET, HOODIE.
TIMELINE'S RIGHT.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.769
- COME ON, TURN AROUND.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.471
- YOU DO KNOW
HE CAN'T HEAR YOU, RIGHT?

06:43.504 --> 06:47.174
- EVEN SO, THE METRO CARD HE
SWIPED, HE COULD'VE CHARGED IT.

06:47.207 --> 06:48.776
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL TAKE IT.

06:48.809 --> 06:52.513
AMARO, ROLLINS,
SEE IF YOU CAN TRACK IT DOWN.

06:54.582 --> 06:57.685
- YOU WANT ME TO MATCH A METRO
CARD TO A BOARD OF ED. EMPLOYEE?

06:57.718 --> 07:01.121
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THAT.
135,000 PEOPLE WORK HERE.

07:01.154 --> 07:03.190
- WELL, IT'S A POLICE MATTER,
SO YOU'LL HAVE TO MAKE TIME.

07:03.223 --> 07:07.060
- 'SCUSE ME, ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS STAY BLACK AND DIE.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.061
- ARE THOSE YOUR KIDS?

07:08.095 --> 07:10.130
WHAT ARE THEY...

07:10.163 --> 07:12.700
TWO AND FOUR?

07:12.733 --> 07:14.234
- THAT'S RIGHT.

07:14.267 --> 07:17.471
- ADORABLE.
I GOT A FIVE-YEAR-OLD.

07:17.505 --> 07:19.206
HOW MANY TIMES
WERE YOU UP LAST NIGHT?

07:19.239 --> 07:21.141
- TOO MANY. YOU?

07:21.174 --> 07:24.878
- ONE BAD DREAM,
TWO GLASSES OF WATER...

07:24.912 --> 07:29.883
FINALLY, WE JUST LET HER
SLEEP IN BED WITH US.

07:29.917 --> 07:34.187
LOOK, WE'RE BOTH TIRED.
OKAY?

07:34.221 --> 07:36.724
THIS METRO CARD,

07:36.757 --> 07:38.492
IT WAS PURCHASED
THROUGH TRANSIT CHECK.

07:38.526 --> 07:39.593
THAT NARROWS IT DOWN,
DOESN'T IT?

07:39.627 --> 07:41.829
CAN YOU...

07:41.862 --> 07:46.133
CAN YOU CHECK FOR US?
PLEASE?

07:46.166 --> 07:49.570
- WELL, I CAN TRY.

07:49.603 --> 07:53.841
- THANK YOU.

07:53.874 --> 07:59.112
- YOU GOT INDIAN IN YOU?

07:59.146 --> 08:01.281
- YEAH, I GET THAT.
SOMETIMES.

08:01.314 --> 08:07.287
I CAN TELL.
THEM CHEEKBONES.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.122
- UGH.
THIS IS GONNA TAKE A WHILE.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.158
WHY DON'T YOU GET A COFFEE?

08:12.893 --> 08:15.829
- SO YOUR WIFE IS BACK HOME
FOR GOOD NOW, RIGHT?

08:15.863 --> 08:17.230
MUST BE NICE.

08:17.264 --> 08:19.800
- YEAH. ZARA'S THRILLED.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.870
WHEN MY MOM FINALLY MOVED OUT,
MARIA BURNED SOME SAGE.

08:22.903 --> 08:25.205
EVERYBODY'S HAPPY.

08:25.238 --> 08:27.274
- MAY CHEN?

08:27.307 --> 08:29.743
HEY, NYPD.

08:29.777 --> 08:31.945
CAN YOU GIVE US A MINUTE?

08:31.979 --> 08:34.615
- YOU'RE HERE
ABOUT THE MOTORCYCLIST?

08:34.648 --> 08:35.883
EVERY DAY, HE SPEEDS.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.651
- WELL,
WE CAN TRACK HIM DOWN.

08:37.685 --> 08:39.587
RIGHT NOW,
WE'RE TRACKING YOUR METRO CARD.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.689
- THE ONE YOU GET
THROUGH TRANSIT CHECK.

08:41.722 --> 08:42.923
YOU GOT THAT ON YOU?

08:42.956 --> 08:44.625
- NO, I WALKED TODAY.

08:44.658 --> 08:46.794
- WHY?
DID YOU LOSE IT, OR...

08:46.827 --> 08:47.595
- NO.

08:47.628 --> 08:51.599
SOMETIMES
MY SON ANDY BORROWS IT.

08:51.632 --> 08:55.703
- SO, ANDY,
HOW OLD IS HE?

09:01.274 --> 09:05.278
- NICE BLACK EYE.

09:07.681 --> 09:09.883
BUSTED NOSE?
- THAT'S OUR GUY.

09:09.917 --> 09:11.652
WE NEED
A NEW SKETCH ARTIST.

09:11.685 --> 09:14.822
- ANDY CHEN?

09:14.855 --> 09:17.725
GOTTA ASK YOU
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS.

09:17.758 --> 09:18.626
- ABOUT WHAT?

09:18.659 --> 09:19.893
- WHY DON'T YOU
COME OVER HERE AND TALK?

09:19.927 --> 09:23.764
KEEP EVERYBODY
OUT YOUR BUSINESS.

09:25.365 --> 09:26.834
- SOMETHING HAPPEN
TO YOUR NOSE?

09:26.867 --> 09:28.636
- OH, THIS.

09:28.669 --> 09:33.006
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?

09:43.751 --> 09:46.820
COME ON! COME ON!

09:46.854 --> 09:48.355
[grunts]
I KNOW MY RIGHTS!

09:48.388 --> 09:49.823
YOU DON'T TOUCH ME!
- YEAH?

09:49.857 --> 09:50.958
- AAH!

09:50.991 --> 09:53.661
AAH!
- GET ON THE FLOOR.

09:53.694 --> 09:58.365
- OH, GOD,
YOU'RE BREAKING IT!

09:58.398 --> 09:59.667
- OH.

09:59.700 --> 10:04.237
OH, WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?
HUH?

10:04.271 --> 10:06.940
- DONE MESSING UP

10:06.974 --> 10:09.743
- ANDY CHEN, 20,
COMMUNITY COLLEGE,

10:09.777 --> 10:12.746
ONE PRIOR FOR SUBWAY GROPING,
LIVES WITH HIS MOTHER.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.047
- WARNER'S
CHECKING HIS DNA

10:14.081 --> 10:16.717
AGAINST THE BLOOD
AT CLAIRE GRANT'S ATTACK SCENE.

10:16.750 --> 10:17.818
- WHERE'S BENSON?

10:17.851 --> 10:19.987
- ICING HER HAND.

10:20.020 --> 10:22.723
- SOMEBODY WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS NOSE?

10:22.756 --> 10:24.758
- FROM THE BEAT-DOWN
LAST NIGHT.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.694
BENSON JUST KNOCKED HIM
UPSIDE THE HEAD.

10:26.727 --> 10:29.396
HE SWUNG AT HER, CAPTAIN.
- I'M SURE.

10:29.429 --> 10:32.265
WELL, EVEN IF WE CAN TIE HIM
TO LAST NIGHT'S ATTACK,

10:32.299 --> 10:35.869
WE HAVE NO DNA, BAD IDs
FROM THE OTHER FIVE RAPES.

10:35.903 --> 10:39.973
A CONFESSION
WOULD BE HELPFUL.

10:40.007 --> 10:44.277
BY THE BOOK.

10:44.311 --> 10:48.015
- WE GOT YOU BEAUTIFUL, ANDY.
DNA, METRO CARD.

10:48.048 --> 10:50.417
YOU'RE DONE, KID.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.385
- YOU'RE JUST MAD
'CAUSE I MADE YOU RUN.

10:52.419 --> 10:55.055
- ANDY, WE HAVE
YOUR PIG-STICKER.

10:55.088 --> 10:56.757
WHAT YOU USED
TO CUT THEIR HAIR.

10:56.790 --> 10:59.893
- I'M NO BARBER.

10:59.927 --> 11:01.428
- NO, YOU'RE JUST A PUNK

11:01.461 --> 11:02.730
THAT KNOCKS DOWN
DRUNK GIRLS FROM BEHIND.

11:02.763 --> 11:05.032
- WHAT, SHE SAY THAT?
SHE'S LYING.

11:05.065 --> 11:06.066
SHE WANTED IT.

11:06.099 --> 11:08.936
SHE SAID
SHE HAD TO HAVE ME.

11:08.969 --> 11:10.938
- OH, YEAH? JUST RIGHT THERE
ON THE SIDEWALK?

11:10.971 --> 11:12.039
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
- THE OTHERS TOO?

11:12.072 --> 11:15.008
- YEAH.

11:15.042 --> 11:17.845
I'M THE KING OF SOHO.

11:17.878 --> 11:20.848
I DID 'EM ALL NIGHT LONG,
THEY BEGGED ME NOT TO STOP.

11:20.881 --> 11:23.751
- ALL RIGHT,
SO THESE GIRLS...

11:23.784 --> 11:27.054
THEY PICKED YOU UP?

11:27.087 --> 11:28.922
SO WHICH ONE DID YOU
LIKE THE MOST, HUH?

11:28.956 --> 11:32.325
- UM...
I DON'T KNOW.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.361
FIRST ONE?

11:34.394 --> 11:35.462
- THE BLONDE?

11:35.495 --> 11:40.067
WHAT WAS SHE WEARING?

11:40.100 --> 11:43.470
- A SKIRT THING.

11:43.503 --> 11:46.006
RIGHT?

11:46.039 --> 11:48.742
WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE
SEEN HER.

11:48.776 --> 11:49.843
WITH THOSE LEGS
IN THE AIR.

11:49.877 --> 11:52.445
- PRETTY SURE IT WASN'T AS HOT
AS THE REDHEAD, THOUGH.

11:52.479 --> 11:56.884
- I DID HER GOOD.

11:56.917 --> 12:00.087
BUT LIKE YOU SAID...

12:00.120 --> 12:03.390
THEY PICK ME UP.

12:05.859 --> 12:10.363
- SIT TIGHT, KING.

12:10.397 --> 12:13.000
- REDHEADS, BLONDES,
LEGS IN THE AIR.

12:13.033 --> 12:16.003
- HE'S GOOD FOR MONDAY NIGHT,
BUT HE'S NOT OUR SERIAL.

12:16.036 --> 12:17.905
- A COPYCAT,
A MASKED CRUSADER...

12:17.938 --> 12:20.473
I REALLY DON'T LIKE
WHERE THIS IS GOING.

12:20.507 --> 12:24.511
- THEN YOU'RE NOT GONNA
LIKE THIS EITHER.

12:24.544 --> 12:27.114
- WHILE NYPD SOURCES
CLAIM TO HAVE A SUSPECT,

12:27.147 --> 12:31.384
I CAN REPORT TONIGHT THAT THE
SOHO RAPIST IS STILL AT LARGE.

12:31.418 --> 12:34.021
I RECEIVED THIS LETTER
JUST MINUTES AGO.

12:34.054 --> 12:38.859
"THE NYPD CAN'T CATCH ME,
COPYCATS CAN'T TOUCH ME,

12:38.892 --> 12:40.427
BATMAN CAN'T STOP ME."

12:40.460 --> 12:41.361
- IS IT HIM?

12:41.394 --> 12:43.563
- WHO ELSE WOULD KNOW
CHEN'S A COPYCAT?

12:43.596 --> 12:45.532
- THE LETTER GOES ON
WITH THREE PAGES OF DETAILS

12:45.565 --> 12:46.433
ABOUT THESE CRIMES.

12:46.466 --> 12:50.537
DETAILS THAT ONLY
THE RAPIST WOULD KNOW.

12:50.570 --> 12:53.841
THE LETTER CONCLUDES
WITH THIS CHILLING THREAT:

12:53.874 --> 12:56.810
"YOU SOHO SLUTS
THINK YOU'RE SPECIAL.

12:56.844 --> 12:58.045
THIS IS JUST
THE BEGINNING."

12:58.078 --> 12:59.847
- WE NEED TO GET
THAT LETTER.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.149
- YOU'LL HAVE TO PRY IT
FROM HIS COLD, DEAD FINGERS.

13:06.954 --> 13:08.221
- CABOT JUST CALLED.
ANDY CHEN IS OUT ON THE STREET.

13:08.255 --> 13:10.557
HE MADE BAIL.
- HOW?

13:10.590 --> 13:13.426
DNA FROM THE BLOOD
AT THE SCENE WAS A MATCH.

13:13.460 --> 13:14.561
HE'S CLAIRE'S ATTACKER.

13:14.594 --> 13:16.596
- WELL, HIS LAWYER
ARGUED THE D.A.

13:16.629 --> 13:19.099
REACTED TO MEDIA PRESSURE
AND HYSTERIA.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.902
CHEN HAS TIES TO THE COMMUNITY,
HE'S AN "A" STUDENT,

13:21.935 --> 13:24.171
HIS CHURCH
POSTED HIS BOND.

13:24.204 --> 13:25.605
TURNS OUT
HE'S A JEHOVAH'S WITNESS.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.876
- COMMUNITY HYSTERIA
IS JUST GETTING STARTED.

13:28.909 --> 13:31.611
CHECK THIS OUT.

13:31.644 --> 13:36.049
- WE ARE OUTRAGED
THAT THIS RAPIST MADE BAIL.

13:36.083 --> 13:38.118
THE POLICE AND JUDICIAL SYSTEM
ARE FAILING US.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.586
crowd: YEAH!

13:39.619 --> 13:42.122
- WE INVITE PEOPLE OF ALL
ORIENTATIONS TO JOIN US TONIGHT

13:42.155 --> 13:44.024
IN A "NO MORE FEAR"
SLUT WALK.

13:44.057 --> 13:46.593
COME AS YOU ARE,
DRESS AS YOU LIKE.

13:46.626 --> 13:47.627
- SLUT WALK?

13:47.660 --> 13:50.130
- IT STARTED IN TORONTO,
AND IT'S GONE GLOBAL.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.599
WOMEN ARE SICK OF
VICTIM-BLAMING, SLUT-SHAMING.

13:52.632 --> 13:54.267
- WELL, THAT'S
ALL WELL AND GOOD,

13:54.301 --> 13:56.203
BUT WE CAN'T
LOSE CONTROL HERE.

13:56.236 --> 13:57.604
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH GRISCOMB'S LETTER?

13:57.637 --> 13:59.172
- HE'S HOLDING IT
FOR NOW,

13:59.206 --> 14:01.508
BUT HE SENT US
A PERSONAL RESPONSE.

14:01.541 --> 14:04.211
"CONGRESS SHALL MAKE NO LAW,"
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,

14:04.244 --> 14:06.579
"ABRIDGING THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH
OR OF THE PRESS."

14:06.613 --> 14:09.149
- IN THE MEANTIME,
THE RAPIST CAN STRIKE AGAIN.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.650
THAT LETTER
COULD HAVE HIS PRINTS ON IT.

14:10.683 --> 14:13.620
- BUT HE HASN'T LEFT DNA
AT FIVE RAPE SCENES?

14:13.653 --> 14:14.988
HE'S NOT GONNA
LEAVE ANYTHING ON A LETTER.

14:15.022 --> 14:16.256
- POINT.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.225
- NO DNA
AT FIVE RAPE SCENES?

14:18.258 --> 14:21.294
I MEAN, IS THIS GUY STARTING
SOMETHING HE CAN'T FINISH?

14:21.328 --> 14:24.064
- SOME OF THE VICTIMS SAID THAT
THEY THOUGHT HE USED A CONDOM.

14:24.097 --> 14:26.233
- YEAH, AND HE MANAGES
TO GET AWAY UNSEEN.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.268
- SO, HE LIVES
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

14:28.301 --> 14:30.170
AND HE'S A SUPER
OR A MAINTENANCE MAN.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.638
- IT'S WORTH A SHOT.

14:31.671 --> 14:34.074
MUNCH, FIN,

14:34.107 --> 14:36.609
RECHECK PRIORS
AND SEX OFFENDERS.

14:36.643 --> 14:38.645
LIV, TALK TO WARNER.

14:38.678 --> 14:41.581
HAVE HER RETEST THE VIC'S
CLOTHES FOR TOUCH DNA.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.550
ROLLINS, TALK TO
ONE OF YOUR RABBIS.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.085
WORK UP A PROFILE.

14:45.118 --> 14:47.054
I GET ONE MORE CALL
FROM THE MAYOR'S OFFICE,

14:47.087 --> 14:49.256
WE'RE ALL LOOKING
FOR NEW JOBS.

14:49.289 --> 14:53.360
AND, UH,
WHERE THE HELL IS AMARO?

15:18.051 --> 15:21.321
[cell phone rings]

15:21.354 --> 15:24.124
- AMARO.

15:24.157 --> 15:27.995
WHAT?

15:28.028 --> 15:31.198
ALL RIGHT,
I'M FIVE MINUTES AWAY.

15:31.231 --> 15:33.600
[engine starts]

15:36.203 --> 15:40.407
'SCUSE ME.

15:47.114 --> 15:48.248
WOW.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.250
- THEY'RE NOT
JUST PLAYING DRESS-UP.

15:50.283 --> 15:53.153
- STREET JUSTICE.

15:53.186 --> 15:55.388
WITNESSES SAY HE GOT JUMPED
BY FIVE SUPERHEROES.

15:55.422 --> 15:57.724
- THEY CALL THEMSELVES
"THE JUSTICE LEAGUE."

15:57.757 --> 16:00.160
- AND NOBODY HELPED.
- NO.

16:00.193 --> 16:03.063
MOST OF 'EM
CHEERED 'EM ON.

16:03.096 --> 16:08.035
- JLNY, ONE.
NYPD, ZERO.

16:08.068 --> 16:11.238
- "JUSTICE LEAGUE NEW YORK."
- I DON'T CARE.

16:11.271 --> 16:16.276
THESE ARE OUR STREETS,
NOT THEIRS.

16:20.213 --> 16:25.185
- THEY WORE M-MASKS.

16:25.218 --> 16:28.188
AND HELMETS.

16:28.221 --> 16:31.091
THERE WAS EVEN
A CHICK THERE.

16:31.124 --> 16:36.129
- TRY A LITTLE MORE
DESCRIPTIVE LANGUAGE, ANDY.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.367
- I DON'T KNOW.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.370
THEY WERE BEATING ME UP.

16:43.403 --> 16:48.375
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.643
YOU MADE
EVERYONE HATE ME.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.312
- NO, THEY HATE YOU
'CAUSE YOU'RE A RAPIST.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.346
NOW, IF I WASN'T A COP,

16:53.380 --> 16:55.315
I'D SMACK YOU AROUND TOO.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.117
- ANDY.

16:57.150 --> 16:59.186
DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

16:59.219 --> 17:00.653
- HERE'S A COPY
OF THE LAWSUIT I'M FILING

17:00.687 --> 17:02.255
AGAINST YOU
AND THE DEPARTMENT

17:02.289 --> 17:05.358
FOR VIOLATING
MY CLIENT'S CIVIL RIGHTS.

17:09.829 --> 17:12.332
- CHECK OUT DOORWAYS
AND VESTIBULES AS YOU PASS.

17:12.365 --> 17:15.668
HE LIKES
TO ATTACK FROM BEHIND.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.704
- AND BE CAREFUL
IN THOSE SPIKES.

17:17.737 --> 17:21.408
MAKES IT HARDER IF YOU GOTTA RUN
OR KICK SOMEBODY IN THE BALLS.

17:21.441 --> 17:24.477
- KEEP THE U.C.s AND GHOSTS
IN RADIO CONTACT.

17:24.511 --> 17:25.812
I DON'T WANT
TO LOSE ANYBODY.

17:25.845 --> 17:26.979
- WELL, WE'RE LOOKING LIGHT
ON BACKUP.

17:27.013 --> 17:30.817
- WE ARE. THE DEPARTMENT'S
TIED UP COVERING THIS MARCH.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.385
- THAT'S JUST
WHAT WE NEED.

17:32.419 --> 17:34.254
100 WOMEN WALKING AROUND
HALF NAKED.

17:34.287 --> 17:36.523
- LET'S JUST
GET THROUGH THE NIGHT.

17:55.875 --> 17:58.211
- RAPE! RAPE!

17:58.245 --> 18:00.180
HELP! RAPE!

18:00.213 --> 18:02.849
HELP!

18:02.882 --> 18:04.184
- FIN, YOU HEAR THAT?
- HELP!

18:04.217 --> 18:08.087
HELP US!

18:10.223 --> 18:13.760
HELP ME!

18:13.793 --> 18:17.297
- WE GOT A CALL. GET IN.

18:17.330 --> 18:20.333
- HELP, PLEASE! HELP!

18:20.367 --> 18:21.501
- THERE'S TWO DOWN.
- OVER HERE.

18:21.534 --> 18:22.869
- THERE'S ONE.
WHERE'S THE OTHER ONE?

18:22.902 --> 18:26.206
- THERE.
HELP HER, PLEASE.

18:26.239 --> 18:27.874
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
UP HERE?

18:27.907 --> 18:30.377
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- FANTASTICA!

18:30.410 --> 18:34.914
IS SHE ALL RIGHT?

18:34.947 --> 18:36.883
- I GOT A STAB VICTIM!

18:36.916 --> 18:38.351
- FANTASTICA!

18:38.385 --> 18:39.286
- WHO?

18:39.319 --> 18:42.522
- FANTASTICA.
HE--HE WAS ON TOP OF HER.

18:42.555 --> 18:45.358
- FIN, HOW'S THE GIRL?

18:45.392 --> 18:47.160
- SHE'S HANGING IN THERE.

18:47.194 --> 18:50.297
- HEY, HEY.
HEY, LOOK AT ME.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.399
WHAT HAPPENED?
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

18:52.432 --> 18:55.435
- I WAS ONLY...

18:55.468 --> 18:58.137
GONE A-A MINUTE...

19:03.943 --> 19:06.346
- I FELT
SOMETHING HIT ME F--

19:06.379 --> 19:08.848
HERE.

19:08.881 --> 19:12.385
I BLACKED OUT,
AND I WOKE UP IN THE AMBULANCE.

19:12.419 --> 19:15.955
- OKAY, DO YOU--DID YOU
HEAR ANYTHING OR SEE ANYTHING

19:15.988 --> 19:17.557
BEFORE YOU WERE
KNOCKED OUT?

19:17.590 --> 19:19.492
- NO.

19:19.526 --> 19:23.596
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME?

19:23.630 --> 19:28.601
- LESLIE, YOU WERE
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED.

19:28.635 --> 19:31.604
- I--

19:31.638 --> 19:33.606
IT CAN'T HAPPEN TO ME.
WE--

19:33.640 --> 19:36.476
WE WERE
SUPPOSED TO CATCH HIM.

19:36.509 --> 19:37.977
- LESLIE IS MY PARTNER.

19:38.010 --> 19:42.282
THAT'S WHAT--WE WERE
ON P-PATROL FOR THE RAPIST.

19:42.315 --> 19:45.585
- AND YOU GOT SEPARATED?

19:45.618 --> 19:47.454
- WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO MEET AT MIDNIGHT,

19:47.487 --> 19:51.824
AND SHE WASN'T THERE,
SO I CH-CHECKED THE OTHER ROOFS,

19:51.858 --> 19:55.828
AND WHEN I GOT BACK,
THAT'S WHEN I--

19:55.862 --> 19:57.630
I-I SAW HIM JUMP HER.

19:57.664 --> 19:59.532
HE HAD A BRICK
IN HIS HAND.

19:59.566 --> 20:02.369
- DO YOU REMEMBER
ANY DETAILS?

20:02.402 --> 20:03.970
YOU DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING
BEFORE HE KNOCKED YOU OUT?

20:04.003 --> 20:06.439
- NO.

20:06.473 --> 20:08.908
- HE WAS WHITE, STOCKY.

20:08.941 --> 20:12.312
IT--IT WAS DARK.

20:12.345 --> 20:15.582
AND I YELLED, AND WHEN
I PULLED HIM OFF HER,

20:15.615 --> 20:17.884
HE CAME AT ME
AND STABBED MY SHOULDER.

20:17.917 --> 20:18.918
- DID YOU SEE THE WEAPON?

20:18.951 --> 20:22.489
- YEAH, IT WAS LIKE
THESE BIG, CURVED SCISSORS

20:22.522 --> 20:23.856
WITH A BLACK HANDLE.

20:23.890 --> 20:27.026
- AND WHO ELSE KNEW
YOU WERE UP THERE?

20:27.059 --> 20:29.596
- JUST STUART.
WE WORK IN TWO-PERSON CELLS.

20:29.629 --> 20:32.332
- OKAY, NOW, HOW DID YOU
GET UP TO THE ROOFTOP?

20:32.365 --> 20:35.001
- FIRE ESCAPE.
IT'S SOHO.

20:35.034 --> 20:37.003
- I'M GONNA CHECK YOUR RAPE KIT
TO SEE IF HE LEFT DNA.

20:37.036 --> 20:40.006
HAVE YOU HAD SEX
IN THE LAST 48 HOURS?

20:40.039 --> 20:42.342
- NO, I'M NOT
SEEING ANYONE.

20:42.375 --> 20:44.977
I WAS JUST TRYING TO PREVENT
OTHER WOMEN FROM BEING RAPED.

20:45.011 --> 20:46.879
- I UNDERSTAND THAT,

20:46.913 --> 20:49.382
BUT YOU REALLY NEED
TO LEAVE THAT TO THE POLICE.

20:49.416 --> 20:51.451
- THAT HASN'T WORKED,
HAS IT?

20:51.484 --> 20:56.523
- WELL,
THIS DIDN'T WORK, DID IT?

20:56.556 --> 20:59.492
- ALL RIGHT, SO YOU AND LESLIE
ARE IN THE JUSTICE LEAGUE,

20:59.526 --> 21:00.993
AND YOU LIED TO US
ABOUT ANDY CHEN.

21:01.027 --> 21:03.630
- NO, I-I-I

21:03.663 --> 21:05.565
I HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH BEATING HIM UP,

21:05.598 --> 21:07.400
AND I-I DON'T KNOW
WHO DID.

21:07.434 --> 21:09.068
- WELL, TOO BAD THEY WEREN'T
AROUND LAST NIGHT.

21:09.101 --> 21:12.372
YOU ALMOST
GOT YOURSELF KILLED.

21:12.405 --> 21:15.007
- HEY, NO. NO,
I'VE DONE MORE IN TWO NIGHTS

21:15.041 --> 21:16.509
THAN YOU GUYS HAVE DONE
IN TWO MONTHS!

21:16.543 --> 21:18.511
- WHAT'RE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

21:18.545 --> 21:19.546
- I SAVED FANTASTICA,

21:19.579 --> 21:21.948
AND I ALSO SAVED THAT OTHER GIRL
ON MONDAY NIGHT.

21:21.981 --> 21:24.517
- BY THE UPS WAREHOUSE.
THAT WAS YOU TOO?

21:24.551 --> 21:26.986
- I'M ON DUTY, OKAY?

21:27.019 --> 21:30.623
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.
I TRAIN, I WORK OUT.

21:30.657 --> 21:32.359
THIS IS SERIOUS.

21:32.392 --> 21:35.595
- OH, YEAH.
SO WHY THE COSTUMES, HUH?

21:35.628 --> 21:38.030
- 'CAUSE THEY TELL THE WORLD
WHAT WE STAND FOR.

21:38.064 --> 21:42.369
- SO, WHO ARE YOU, HUH?

21:42.402 --> 21:44.471
- 12...

21:44.504 --> 21:46.005
19.

21:46.038 --> 21:47.340
ROMANS.

21:47.374 --> 21:49.976
- "VENGEANCE IS MINE,
SAITH THE LORD."

21:50.009 --> 21:52.445
- YOU DRAGGED LESLIE OUT
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

21:52.479 --> 21:54.614
DRESSED LIKE A FREAK WHILE
THERE'S A RAPIST ON THE LOOSE?

21:54.647 --> 21:56.983
- FANTASTICA WANTED TO C--
COME.

21:57.016 --> 21:58.418
I DIDN'T M-MAKE HER
DO ANYTHING.

21:58.451 --> 22:00.587
- SHE GOT RAPED
PLAYING GAMES!

22:00.620 --> 22:01.954
- WHY ARE YOU HERE, HUH?
- SHE CALLED ME.

22:01.988 --> 22:04.056
SHE OBVIOUSLY NEEDS
A GROWNUP AROUND RIGHT NOW.

22:04.090 --> 22:05.958
- HEY, DON'T MOVE.
WE'RE NOT DONE HERE.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.760
HEY.

22:07.794 --> 22:09.962
- I WANT TO SEE LESLIE.
- YEAH, NOT RIGHT NOW.

22:09.996 --> 22:14.767
SO, HENRY, WHERE DID YOU GO
LAST NIGHT AFTER THE WALK? HMM?

22:14.801 --> 22:17.970
DID YOU GO ON, UH,
SUPERHERO PATROL?

22:18.004 --> 22:19.572
- WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

22:19.606 --> 22:24.677
I'M 50. I WAS HOME
WITH MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER.

22:24.711 --> 22:30.450
EXCUSE ME.
HI.

22:30.483 --> 22:33.553
- I'M SORRY
I MISSED YOU YESTERDAY.

22:33.586 --> 22:37.457
I MEAN, WE'RE JUST GOING
AROUND THE CLOCK.

22:37.490 --> 22:39.158
- YEAH.
I SAW GRISCOMB ON THE NEWS.

22:39.191 --> 22:43.129
HE'S A PIECE OF WORK.
- HE'S A PRICK.

22:43.162 --> 22:46.799
- YEAH.
- HOW'S YOUR WEEK BEEN?

22:46.833 --> 22:48.801
- UM, FINE.

22:48.835 --> 22:51.604
IT'S FINE, IT'S JUST A LOT
OF ERRANDS AND RUNNING AROUND.

22:51.638 --> 22:55.475
BUT IT'S REALLY NICE
TO HAVE TIME WITH ZARA.

22:55.508 --> 22:58.010
- YEAH.

22:58.044 --> 22:59.712
WELL,
HOW 'BOUT YESTERDAY?

22:59.746 --> 23:02.815
- YESTERDAY?

23:02.849 --> 23:04.817
- YEAH.
I MISSED YOU ALL DAY.

23:04.851 --> 23:08.054
- OH, I TOOK ZARA
TO THE PARK.

23:08.087 --> 23:10.657
AND WE PLAYED PRINCESSES.

23:10.690 --> 23:12.725
SO, IT WAS...

23:12.759 --> 23:17.730
KINDA BORING.

23:17.764 --> 23:19.732
- WELL,
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

23:19.766 --> 23:24.737
- YEAH, NO, IT WAS FUN.

23:24.771 --> 23:28.641
- YOU KNOW,
I TRIED YOU AT LUNCH.

23:28.675 --> 23:33.045
I HAD A LITTLE BREAK,
SO I FIGURED, YOU KNOW.

23:33.079 --> 23:35.515
- MY PHONE DIDN'T RING.
DID YOU LEAVE A MESSAGE?

23:35.548 --> 23:37.750
- OH, NO.
NO, I FIGURED YOU WERE BUSY.

23:37.784 --> 23:38.851
- YEAH.

23:38.885 --> 23:40.219
- NEXT TIME.

23:40.252 --> 23:43.456
- MM-HMM.

23:48.160 --> 23:52.532
- IN THIS FOOTAGE, OBTAINED
EXCLUSIVELY BY NEW YORK 3 NEWS,

23:52.565 --> 23:56.202
ALLEGED RAPIST ANDY CHEN
IS ATTACKED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT

23:56.235 --> 23:59.539
BY FIVE MEMBERS OF
THE JUSTICE LEAGUE OF NEW YORK

23:59.572 --> 24:01.207
WHILE SOME WITNESSES
CHEERED THEM ON.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.241
- [screaming]

24:02.274 --> 24:03.710
- THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT.

24:03.743 --> 24:05.144
THIS IS BRUTAL.

24:05.177 --> 24:07.079
- YEAH, IT'S LIKE
THAT TRAYVON MARTIN KID

24:07.113 --> 24:08.080
GETTING SHOT IN FLORIDA.

24:08.114 --> 24:09.549
IT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN PEOPLE

24:09.582 --> 24:10.550
TRY TO TAKE THE LAW
INTO THEIR OWN HANDS.

24:10.583 --> 24:13.085
- THAT LAST NIGHT'S VIC?

24:13.119 --> 24:16.889
- YEAH, LESLIE ADAMS.
A.K.A. FANTASTICA.

24:16.923 --> 24:19.191
- THAT GIRL
CAN HANDLE HERSELF.

24:19.225 --> 24:22.094
- ARE WE SURE
IT'S NOT ANOTHER COPYCAT?

24:22.128 --> 24:23.262
- IT'S NOT LIKELY,
I MEAN, HER HAIR WAS CUT.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.164
WE NEVER RELEASED
THAT DETAIL.

24:25.197 --> 24:26.265
- LESLIE WAS THE ONLY ONE
THAT WAS KNOCKED OUT.

24:26.298 --> 24:27.266
- WHY?

24:27.299 --> 24:29.702
- WELL,
REMEMBER HIS NOTE?

24:29.736 --> 24:32.572
HE'S SENDING A MESSAGE.

24:32.605 --> 24:34.541
- TO THE VIGILANTES?
- YEAH.

24:34.574 --> 24:37.710
- WELL, HOW DID THE RAPIST
EVEN KNOW WHERE TO FIND LESLIE?

24:37.744 --> 24:39.579
- LOOK, STUART AND LESLIE--

24:39.612 --> 24:40.913
NOW THEY'VE BEEN INVOLVED
IN COMMUNITY OUTREACH FOR WEEKS.

24:40.947 --> 24:45.151
SO IF THE RAPIST
INFILTRATED THEIR GROUP,

24:45.184 --> 24:48.588
HE'D KNOW THEY WERE
UP ON THE ROOF.

24:48.621 --> 24:50.823
- THE SERIAL RAPIST
HAS BEEN ATTENDING

24:50.857 --> 24:52.859
HIS OWN
ANTI-RAPIST RALLIES?

24:52.892 --> 24:55.662
HENRY BRAZECKI'S
RESTAURANT

24:55.695 --> 24:57.229
HAS BEEN GROUND ZERO
FOR THIS MOVEMENT.

24:57.263 --> 25:00.266
LET'S GET A LIST
OF HIS MEMBERS.

25:06.238 --> 25:07.774
- LET ME GET
THIS STRAIGHT.

25:07.807 --> 25:10.209
YOU THINK MY GROUP
IS A FRONT

25:10.242 --> 25:13.179
FOR THE VIGILANTES
AND THE RAPIST?

25:13.212 --> 25:14.781
THIS IS NYPD PAYBACK.

25:14.814 --> 25:16.749
- LISTEN, IF YOU'D HAVE
TOLD US LESLIE WAS A MEMBER

25:16.783 --> 25:18.150
OF THE JUSTICE LEAGUE
WHEN WE ASKED YOU,

25:18.184 --> 25:19.085
SHE MIGHT NOT
HAVE BEEN HURT.

25:19.118 --> 25:21.688
- FIRST INKLING I HAD
WAS AT THE MARCH.

25:21.721 --> 25:23.255
ON WEDNESDAY.

25:23.289 --> 25:25.625
WE GOT INTO A FIGHT
AFTERWARD.

25:25.658 --> 25:27.860
- FIGHT. OKAY.

25:27.894 --> 25:29.629
BUT YOU STILL LET HER
GO OFF ON HER OWN?

25:29.662 --> 25:32.632
- YOU'RE MARRIED. DO YOU EVER
TRY TELLING A WOMAN WHAT TO DO?

25:32.665 --> 25:34.767
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

25:34.801 --> 25:36.769
- YOU AND YOUR GROUP ARE FACING
REAL CREDIBILITY ISSUES HERE.

25:36.803 --> 25:38.871
- ME?

25:38.905 --> 25:41.874
I WAS IN WEST SOHO
BEFORE IT WAS GENTRIFIED.

25:41.908 --> 25:43.976
I'M TRYING TO SAVE IT.
- OKAY.

25:44.010 --> 25:45.878
THEN HELP US OUT. HUH?

25:45.912 --> 25:47.747
LET US GO THROUGH
YOUR EMAIL LIST.

25:47.780 --> 25:50.650
- I'LL HAVE TO TALK
TO THE GROUP ABOUT THAT.

25:50.683 --> 25:52.184
WE DO EVERYTHING
BY CONSENSUS.

25:52.218 --> 25:54.253
- WHAT ARE THESE? HUH?

25:54.286 --> 25:55.922
POULTRY SHEARS?

25:55.955 --> 25:58.791
- VERY GOOD, DETECTIVE.

25:58.825 --> 26:01.828
HEY, DON'T TOUCH THESE.
THEY'RE SHARP.

26:01.861 --> 26:04.764
I GOT A DINNER RUSH.

26:07.233 --> 26:08.801
- WHAT'S WITH
THE POULTRY SHEARS?

26:08.835 --> 26:12.371
- THEY MIGHT BE A MATCH
FOR STUART'S WOUNDS.

26:12.404 --> 26:15.341
CAN YOU ASK THE M.E.
TO TAKE A LOOK?

26:15.374 --> 26:17.343
- I COULD.

26:17.376 --> 26:18.911
SO COULD YOU.

26:18.945 --> 26:23.950
- BUT I GOT A FAMILY THING.
JUST COVER FOR ME.

26:38.430 --> 26:39.431
HEY, JASON.

26:39.465 --> 26:43.235
- DETECTIVE AMARO.
WHAT'RE YOU DOING IN PHILLY?

26:43.269 --> 26:45.004
- UH...

26:45.037 --> 26:46.038
- MY DAUGHTER WAS JUST
TALKING ABOUT YOU.

26:46.072 --> 26:47.373
SHE'S DOING BETTER.
- IS SHE?

26:47.406 --> 26:50.710
GOOD FOR HER.
YOU HAVE A NICE LUNCH YESTERDAY?

26:50.743 --> 26:53.412
- LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU--

26:53.445 --> 26:58.651
- STAY AWAY FROM MY WIFE.

27:20.306 --> 27:22.274
- HEY!

27:22.308 --> 27:24.276
WHAT DO YOU--
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

27:24.310 --> 27:25.411
WHAT DO YOU GUYS WANT?

27:25.444 --> 27:29.982
- [grunting]

27:30.016 --> 27:32.084
- AAH!

27:32.118 --> 27:36.655
[groaning]

27:45.497 --> 27:49.368
- SOHO ICON HENRY BRAZECKI WAS
BEATEN BY VIGILANTES LAST NIGHT,

27:49.401 --> 27:52.839
AND HOSPITALIZED WITH
A CONCUSSION AND A BROKEN HAND.

27:52.872 --> 27:56.743
DETECTIVE,
DO YOU HAVE ANY LEADS?

27:56.776 --> 27:59.846
- ME? YOU'RE THE ONE
WITHHOLDING EVIDENCE.

27:59.879 --> 28:01.981
YOU CARE TO COMMENT?

28:03.482 --> 28:07.053
- SASSY.

28:07.086 --> 28:08.821
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR HAND?

28:08.855 --> 28:12.424
- MUST'VE BANGED IT.

28:12.458 --> 28:16.462
- FEEL BETTER AFTERWARD?

28:16.495 --> 28:20.066
- DETECTIVES!
- YEAH? OKAY.

28:20.099 --> 28:23.469
I GOTTA
GET BACK TO YOU LATER.

28:23.502 --> 28:26.806
- YOU WANNA LOOK AT THIS?

28:26.839 --> 28:27.807
- LOCKS OF HAIR.

28:27.840 --> 28:30.076
SIX OF 'EM.

28:30.109 --> 28:31.377
- KEEPING 'EM AS TROPHIES.

28:31.410 --> 28:34.113
- WHAT, IN HIS CAR?
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?

28:34.146 --> 28:38.084
- IT'S MORE PRIVATE THAN
IN HIS HOME OR THE RESTAURANT.

28:38.117 --> 28:40.953
- [sighs]
HENRY'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

28:40.987 --> 28:44.090
THE JUSTICE LEAGUE MADE HENRY
AS A RAPIST BEFORE WE DID?

28:44.123 --> 28:47.827
MAYBE THEY
KNOW SOMETHING WE DON'T.

28:47.860 --> 28:50.763
- WHY DID YOU BEAT UP
HENRY BRAZECKI LAST NIGHT?

28:50.797 --> 28:52.098
- IT WASN'T ME.

28:52.131 --> 28:54.433
COME--HOW--

28:54.466 --> 28:55.434
C-COULD I?

28:55.467 --> 28:56.635
I CAN'T EVEN LIFT MY ARM.

28:56.668 --> 29:01.473
- RIGHT. SO, THE NIGHT AFTER
YOU FIGHT OFF LESLIE'S RAPIST,

29:01.507 --> 29:05.111
HENRY GETS TARGETED.

29:05.144 --> 29:09.015
YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE
STABBED WITH SHEARS.

29:09.048 --> 29:11.083
BLACK HANDLES, RIGHT?

29:11.117 --> 29:14.420
JUST LIKE THE SHEARS
IN HENRY'S KITCHEN.

29:14.453 --> 29:17.790
WHY ARE YOU
COVERING FOR HIM?

29:17.824 --> 29:20.192
YOU THINK
WE CAN'T DO OUR JOB,

29:20.226 --> 29:22.194
SO YOU TAKE MATTERS
INTO YOUR OWN HANDS, RIGHT?

29:22.228 --> 29:23.529
- I HAD TO.

29:23.562 --> 29:25.197
LESLIE IS ONE OF US.

29:25.231 --> 29:28.467
SHE'S THE ONLY GIRL WITH COURAGE
TO TAKE TO THE STREETS.

29:28.500 --> 29:29.435
- YOU TWO ARE CLOSE.
WE--WE GET THAT.

29:29.468 --> 29:30.937
I MEAN, YOU FELT BAD
THAT SHE GOT ATTACKED--

29:30.970 --> 29:31.938
- I SAVED HER.

29:31.971 --> 29:33.472
NOT YOU.

29:33.505 --> 29:36.142
- RIGHT.

29:36.175 --> 29:40.913
LISTEN, WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
TO CHARGE HENRY WITH.

29:40.947 --> 29:45.017
SO IF YOU THINK THAT HE
RAPED HER, YOU GOTTA HELP US.

29:45.051 --> 29:48.554
[cup squeaks]

29:52.558 --> 29:56.562
- [sighs]

29:56.595 --> 30:00.432
ON--ON THE ROOF...

30:00.466 --> 30:05.071
WHEN HE WAS
ON TOP OF LESLIE...

30:05.104 --> 30:09.808
I HEARD HIM SAY, "YOU THINK
YOU'RE SPECIAL, BITCH?"

30:12.945 --> 30:17.950
I RECOGNIZED HIS VOICE.

30:22.221 --> 30:25.858
- HENRY, THE TOWN CRIER,
IS THE SOHO RAPIST?

30:25.892 --> 30:27.559
- UNLESS HE HAS
SIX LOCKS OF HAIR IN HIS CAR

30:27.593 --> 30:29.195
THAT DON'T MATCH
ANY OF OUR VICS.

30:29.228 --> 30:32.164
- STUART'S WOUNDS WERE
CONSISTENT WITH A CURVED BLADE

30:32.198 --> 30:34.100
LIKE POULTRY SHEARS.

30:34.133 --> 30:35.567
AND EVERY ATTACK HAPPENED

30:35.601 --> 30:37.603
WITHIN EASY WALKING DISTANCE
FROM HIS RESTAURANT.

30:37.636 --> 30:39.471
- IT'S A SMART MOVE
FOR A SERIAL.

30:39.505 --> 30:41.874
BE ON THE FRONT LINES,
MAKING THE MOST NOISE.

30:41.908 --> 30:43.009
- YOU KNOW,
IT MAY BE MORE THAN THAT.

30:43.042 --> 30:45.211
HE'S CREATING
A CRISIS TO SOLVE,

30:45.244 --> 30:47.213
LIKE A FIREFIGHTER
WHO, YOU KNOW,

30:47.246 --> 30:49.115
STARTS FIRES 'CAUSE HE WANTS
TO PLAY THE HERO.

30:49.148 --> 30:51.217
- CHECKMATE.

30:51.250 --> 30:55.121
DNA FROM LESLIE'S RAPE KIT
IS A MATCH TO HENRY.

30:55.154 --> 30:58.925
- THEY BROKE MY HAND.
I CAN'T CHOP, I CAN'T WORK.

30:58.958 --> 31:00.226
- LOOKS LIKE THEY KNEW
WHAT THEY WERE DOING.

31:00.259 --> 31:02.228
- WHY THE HELL
WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

31:02.261 --> 31:06.032
- 'CAUSE LESLIE'S
RAPE KIT CAME BACK.

31:06.065 --> 31:09.235
AND YOURS IS THE ONLY
DNA WE FOUND.

31:09.268 --> 31:11.237
SHE SAYS
SHE ISN'T SEEING ANYONE.

31:11.270 --> 31:12.939
- OKAY.

31:12.972 --> 31:15.241
SHE SAID THAT FOR ME.

31:15.274 --> 31:18.610
I DIDN'T RAPE HER.

31:18.644 --> 31:21.513
YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND, OKAY?
I'M A PUBLIC FIGURE.

31:21.547 --> 31:22.648
A MARRIED MAN.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

31:22.681 --> 31:24.516
A RING DOESN'T MEAN MUCH
TO SOME PEOPLE.

31:24.550 --> 31:25.651
- IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

31:25.684 --> 31:30.422
THE RAPES STARTED,
WE GREW CLOSE,

31:30.456 --> 31:32.358
SHE WAS NERVOUS
BEING ALONE.

31:32.391 --> 31:35.494
- RIGHT, SO YOU GAVE HER
A SHOULDER TO CRY ON.

31:35.527 --> 31:37.496
NOW YOU DO THE SAME THING
FOR THE OTHER FIVE VICTIMS?

31:37.529 --> 31:39.031
- WHAT?

31:39.065 --> 31:40.499
NO.

31:40.532 --> 31:41.667
IF YOUR RAPE KIT
TELLS YOU THAT,

31:41.700 --> 31:43.369
YOU GOT A PROBLEM
IN YOUR CRIME LAB.

31:43.402 --> 31:46.505
- NO, IT'S NOT OUR LAB.
IT'S FROM YOUR CAR.

31:46.538 --> 31:50.943
THERE WERE TROPHIES
FROM EACH VICTIM.

31:50.977 --> 31:51.978
- YOU'RE FRAMING ME NOW?

31:52.011 --> 31:54.046
I WANT A LAWYER.

31:54.080 --> 31:56.382
- YEAH? GET A GOOD ONE.

31:56.415 --> 32:00.987
AND WHEN YOU CALL HIM, YOU TELL
HIM YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

32:04.323 --> 32:07.593
- I HAD TO LIE ABOUT IT.
HE'S MARRIED.

32:07.626 --> 32:09.661
HE SAID IT COULD
RUIN HIM.

32:09.695 --> 32:14.700
IS HE OKAY?
- HE'LL BE FINE.

32:16.468 --> 32:18.670
- AND YOU THINK HENRY...

32:18.704 --> 32:20.006
RAPED ME?

32:20.039 --> 32:22.274
NO.

32:22.308 --> 32:26.078
[chuckles]
HE LOVES ME.

32:26.112 --> 32:28.447
- YOU SAID YOU WERE UNCONSCIOUS
DURING THE ASSAULT.

32:28.480 --> 32:30.716
YOU NEVER SAW THE ATTACKER,
HE HIT YOU FROM BEHIND.

32:30.749 --> 32:32.518
- IT WASN'T HENRY.

32:32.551 --> 32:34.620
- YOU AND HENRY HAD A FIGHT WHEN
YOU CAME HOME FROM THE MARCH.

32:34.653 --> 32:36.522
YOU WANNA
TELL US ABOUT THAT?

32:36.555 --> 32:41.393
- HE FIGURED OUT I WAS
IN ON THE JUSTICE LEAGUE.

32:41.427 --> 32:42.694
HE TRIED
TO TELL ME NOT TO GO,

32:42.728 --> 32:46.398
BUT I'D PROMISED STUART

32:46.432 --> 32:48.634
WE'D GO ON PATROL.

32:48.667 --> 32:50.736
HENRY SAID IT WAS
DANGEROUS, STUPID.

32:50.769 --> 32:54.040
HE GOT REALLY ANGRY.

32:54.073 --> 32:55.307
- I DIDN'T RAPE ANYBODY.

32:55.341 --> 32:56.508
DIDN'T LESLIE
TELL YOU WE'RE INVOLVED?

32:56.542 --> 32:58.610
- NO, SHE TOLD US THAT YOU KNEW
THAT SHE WAS ON THE ROOF,

32:58.644 --> 33:00.112
AND THAT YOU WERE
ANGRY ABOUT IT.

33:00.146 --> 33:01.580
YOU WERE JEALOUS
ABOUT IT.

33:01.613 --> 33:03.515
- I WAS ANGRY BECAUSE
I DIDN'T WANT HER TO GET HURT.

33:03.549 --> 33:04.616
- RIGHT.

33:04.650 --> 33:06.452
AND THE BAGGIE WITH THE LOCK
OF HAIR IN YOUR CAR--

33:06.485 --> 33:07.653
- MY CLIENT
HAS MAINTAINED

33:07.686 --> 33:09.421
HE HAS NO IDEA
HOW THAT GOT INTO HIS CAR.

33:09.455 --> 33:10.756
- OKAY.

33:10.789 --> 33:12.658
THEN, WHY DON'T YOU
TELL US WHERE YOU WERE

33:12.691 --> 33:15.127
AFTER MIDNIGHT
ON MARCH 15TH,

33:15.161 --> 33:18.530
MARCH 29TH,
AND APRIL 9TH?

33:18.564 --> 33:19.531
AND PLEASE DON'T SAY
THAT YOU WERE AT THE RESTAURANT,

33:19.565 --> 33:20.599
'CAUSE WE
ALREADY CHECKED.

33:20.632 --> 33:23.569
- OKAY, THEN I WAS HOME
WITH MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER.

33:23.602 --> 33:25.037
- YOUR WIFE?

33:25.071 --> 33:26.338
YOU WANT HER
TO VERIFY THIS?

33:26.372 --> 33:27.806
- HENRY, WORRY ABOUT
YOUR MARRIAGE LATER.

33:27.839 --> 33:32.411
YOU'RE IN REAL
TROUBLE HERE.

33:34.513 --> 33:38.484
- DON'T GO TO MY WIFE.

33:38.517 --> 33:41.453
THE NIGHT
OF THE FIRST RAPE,

33:41.487 --> 33:44.623
I WAS WITH AMY,
MY PASTRY CHEF.

33:44.656 --> 33:49.561
SHE'S ALSO MARRIED, SO GO AHEAD
AND WRECK HER LIFE TOO.

33:49.595 --> 33:52.098
THE OTHER NIGHTS
I WAS EITHER

33:52.131 --> 33:55.367
WITH LESLIE OR JANETTE,

33:55.401 --> 33:56.702
MY WIFE'S SISTER.
- WOW.

33:56.735 --> 33:58.170
- IT'S NOT
WHAT YOU THINK.

33:58.204 --> 34:02.841
- YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I THINK.

34:02.874 --> 34:04.610
- THREE FOR THREE.

34:04.643 --> 34:06.812
LESLIE, THE PASTRY CHEF,
HIS SISTER-IN-LAW,

34:06.845 --> 34:08.714
ALL CONFIRMED
HENRY'S ALIBIS.

34:08.747 --> 34:10.816
- DOORMAN
AND VIDEO FOOTAGE CONFIRM.

34:10.849 --> 34:12.418
- HE'S NOT OUR SERIAL.

34:12.451 --> 34:14.520
- OKAY, SO, SOMEBODY
PUT THAT HAIR INTO HENRY'S CAR.

34:14.553 --> 34:15.387
- YEAH.

34:15.421 --> 34:18.124
PROBABLY
THE SAME PERSON WHO TOLD US

34:18.157 --> 34:20.826
HE SAW HENRY ON THE ROOF
ATTACKING LESLIE.

34:20.859 --> 34:22.528
[files clatter]

34:22.561 --> 34:24.530
- WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU?

34:24.563 --> 34:26.598
- MARIA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- NO!

34:26.632 --> 34:28.834
NO, I WANT TO KNOW
WHY YOU DRIVE TO PHILLY,

34:28.867 --> 34:30.802
YOU ATTACK A FRIEND OF MINE--
- A FRIEND?

34:30.836 --> 34:35.807
- NICK. NICK, NOT HERE.

34:35.841 --> 34:40.712
- COME ON.

34:42.681 --> 34:45.751
- THAT RIGHT THERE IS WHY I
STOPPED MARRYING ITALIAN WOMEN.

34:45.784 --> 34:49.421
- YOU COME TO THE STATION?
HMM?

34:49.455 --> 34:51.157
YOU EMBARRASS ME
IN FRONT OF MY SQUAD?

34:51.190 --> 34:53.892
- AFTER YOU ASSAULT JASON!
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?

34:53.925 --> 34:54.893
- YOU'VE BEEN SNEAKING AROUND
WITH THAT GUY!

34:54.926 --> 34:56.428
- WHAT'RE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

34:56.462 --> 34:58.430
- YOU TOLD ME
YOU STAYED HOME THE OTHER DAY.

34:58.464 --> 34:59.431
YOU HAD LUNCH WITH HIM.

34:59.465 --> 35:01.533
- YOU FOLLOWED ME.

35:01.567 --> 35:03.169
- YOU LIED TO ME!

35:03.202 --> 35:04.703
- BECAUSE I KNEW
THAT YOU WOULD REACT LIKE THIS.

35:04.736 --> 35:08.674
THERE IS NOTHING GOING ON
BETWEEN US, OKAY? WE JUST TALK.

35:08.707 --> 35:10.809
- WELL, I'M YOUR HUSBAND, RIGHT?
YOU TALK TO ME.

35:10.842 --> 35:11.810
- LIKE THIS?

35:11.843 --> 35:15.714
WE TALK LIKE THIS.

35:15.747 --> 35:17.583
I AM NOT
HAVING AN AFFAIR.

35:17.616 --> 35:23.589
- YEAH, I DON'T
BELIEVE YOU, MARIA.

35:23.622 --> 35:26.458
LOOK, I SAW YOU.

35:26.492 --> 35:28.827
THAT BROWNSTONE
ON 27TH STREET.

35:28.860 --> 35:30.496
NO NAME ON THE DOOR.
YOU THINK I'M STUPID?

35:30.529 --> 35:31.497
- HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN FOLLOWING ME?

35:31.530 --> 35:33.165
- IS THAT
WHERE YOU MEET HIM?

35:33.199 --> 35:34.800
HMM?

35:34.833 --> 35:36.468
IS THAT WHERE YOU'VE
BEEN SCREWIN' HIM?

35:36.502 --> 35:41.473
- NO.

35:41.507 --> 35:45.577
NO, THAT'S
MY PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE.

35:54.686 --> 35:55.787
I'VE BEEN
SEEING A SHRINK.

35:55.821 --> 35:59.658
I DIDN'T TELL YOU BECAUSE
I KNOW YOU CAN'T HANDLE IT

35:59.691 --> 36:00.926
BECAUSE YOU WANT
EVERYTHING TO BE PERFECT.

36:00.959 --> 36:03.762
WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.
I'M NOT LIKE THAT.

36:03.795 --> 36:05.631
- LOOK, I DIDN'T--I DIDN'T KNOW.
- NO, YOU DIDN'T THINK.

36:05.664 --> 36:08.600
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
TRUST ME.

36:11.970 --> 36:14.240
I'M YOUR WIFE.

36:14.273 --> 36:16.775
YOU CAN'T TREAT ME
LIKE ONE OF YOUR SUSPECTS.

36:16.808 --> 36:18.710
- MARIA--
- NO, STAY AWAY FROM ME.

36:18.744 --> 36:23.782
- MARIA, LISTEN TO ME.
- STAY AWAY.

37:00.852 --> 37:02.854
- LET'S GO BACK TO WORK.

37:02.888 --> 37:03.855
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

37:03.889 --> 37:06.558
- YEAH, I'M GOOD.
SORRY.

37:06.592 --> 37:07.693
- NO, IT'S OKAY.

37:07.726 --> 37:10.662
- THANKS FOR--
- YEAH.

37:10.696 --> 37:13.832
- SO WHERE WERE WE?

37:13.865 --> 37:15.701
- WE WERE LOOKING
AT STUART.

37:15.734 --> 37:18.570
HE'S GOT NO ALIBI
FOR HENRY'S BEAT-DOWN.

37:18.604 --> 37:21.307
- IT'S PRETTY EASY FOR HIM TO
PLANT THE HAIR IN HENRY'S CAR.

37:21.340 --> 37:22.974
- WARNER SAYS
IT'S POSSIBLE

37:23.008 --> 37:25.677
THE WOUNDS ON STUART'S SHOULDER
WERE SELF-INFLICTED.

37:25.711 --> 37:27.613
- [sighs]

37:27.646 --> 37:30.582
I MEAN, HIS BEHAVIOR
WHEN WE INTERROGATED HIM--

37:30.616 --> 37:32.017
TEARING THAT STYROFOAM CUP
WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT LESLIE.

37:32.050 --> 37:34.286
HE'S--

37:34.320 --> 37:37.323
HE'S OBSESSIVE. HE WORKS
AT THIS COMIC BOOK STORE.

37:37.356 --> 37:38.724
- I CAN SEE IT.

37:38.757 --> 37:40.058
HE'S AN OUTSIDER
WHO'S DESPERATE

37:40.091 --> 37:41.893
TO BE SEEN AS A HERO
IN LESLIE'S EYES.

37:41.927 --> 37:44.596
- YOU TWO GOT ALL THAT
FROM THE WAY HE TEARS A CUP?

37:44.630 --> 37:46.932
- I MEAN, HE LEADS
A DOUBLE LIFE.

37:46.965 --> 37:48.600
THIS FANTASY LIFE.

37:48.634 --> 37:51.002
- WE DON'T KNOW
HOW DARK IT GOES.

37:51.036 --> 37:54.806
- ROLLINS, YOU AND AMARO
GO BACK TO STUART.

38:01.112 --> 38:03.882
- [sighs]

38:03.915 --> 38:07.853
- I-I-I TOLD YOU,
HENRY'S THE GUY.

38:07.886 --> 38:08.887
WHY HAVEN'T YOU
ARRESTED HIM YET?

38:08.920 --> 38:11.357
- WE NEED TO MAKE SURE
ALL OUR DETAILS ARE RIGHT.

38:11.390 --> 38:13.024
- YEAH, HENRY'S GOT
A LOT OF SUPPORTERS.

38:13.058 --> 38:15.627
EVERY WOMAN IN SOHO
SEES HIM AS A HERO.

38:15.661 --> 38:16.962
EVEN LESLIE.
- WAIT--

38:16.995 --> 38:18.364
S-S-STILL?

38:18.397 --> 38:20.732
DIDN'T YOU TELL HER
THAT HE'S THE RAPIST?

38:20.766 --> 38:21.733
- ARE YOU WITH US,
STUART?

38:21.767 --> 38:23.369
JUST WALK ME
THROUGH THIS.

38:23.402 --> 38:25.904
YOU GET UP HERE,
AND WHAT DO YOU SEE?

38:25.937 --> 38:29.341
- I--SEE HENRY

38:29.375 --> 38:31.777
LEANING OVER LESLIE,
ABOUT TO RAPE HER.

38:31.810 --> 38:32.878
- AND YOU RACE OVER,

38:32.911 --> 38:33.979
JUST IN TIME.

38:34.012 --> 38:35.647
- YEAH.

38:35.681 --> 38:40.051
AND THEN HE TURNS,
AND HE HAS THE SCISSORS,

38:40.085 --> 38:41.887
AND THEN--
BAM, INTO MY SHOULDER.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.889
- WAIT, LIKE THAT?

38:43.922 --> 38:45.891
WAS IT LEFT-HANDED,
RIGHT-HANDED?

38:45.924 --> 38:49.995
- UH, I GUESS--
UH, IT WAS HIS LEFT.

38:50.028 --> 38:51.797
- HUH.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.064
BECAUSE OUR
MEDICAL EXAMINER

38:53.098 --> 38:54.766
SAID YOUR STAB WOUNDS
WERE RIGHT-HANDED,

38:54.800 --> 38:56.968
UPSIDE-DOWN.

38:57.002 --> 38:59.405
- KIND OF LIKE WHAT YOU DID.
SELF-INFLICTED.

38:59.438 --> 39:02.674
- NO--WHAT--NO, THEY'RE--
THEY'RE WRONG.

39:02.708 --> 39:04.009
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

39:04.042 --> 39:04.876
- WE'RE NOT SURE.

39:04.910 --> 39:09.948
I MEAN, WE WERE THINKING
IT'S BECAUSE

39:09.981 --> 39:13.084
YOU WANTED LESLIE TO THINK
THAT YOU'D SAVED HER.

39:13.118 --> 39:14.986
- NO, I DID SAVE HER.

39:15.020 --> 39:15.987
- FROM THE SOHO RAPIST.

39:16.021 --> 39:17.923
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- OKAY.

39:17.956 --> 39:20.692
AND HE'S BEEN OUT THERE
TWO MONTHS?

39:20.726 --> 39:23.495
THAT'S ABOUT THE SAME TIME
YOU'VE KNOWN LESLIE, RIGHT?

39:23.529 --> 39:26.698
- I-I GUESS.

39:26.732 --> 39:28.099
- 'CAUSE SHE TOLD US
HOW YOU MET.

39:28.133 --> 39:30.502
SHE CAME INTO YOUR STORE
TO BUY A GIFT

39:30.536 --> 39:32.170
FOR HER NEPHEW?
- YEAH.

39:32.203 --> 39:35.040
I--I SHOWED HER
JIMMY CORRIGAN.

39:35.073 --> 39:38.043
AND OBVIOUSLY
THE DARK NIGHT RETURNS.

39:38.076 --> 39:40.045
AND THE NEW AVENGERS.

39:40.078 --> 39:43.749
SHE WAS...
REALLY COOL.

39:43.782 --> 39:46.084
- YEAH, SO YOU DON'T SEE
A LOT OF GIRLS LIKE LESLIE

39:46.117 --> 39:47.185
IN A STORE LIKE YOURS.

39:47.218 --> 39:49.455
OH.

39:49.488 --> 39:51.189
SO YOU TOLD HER
ABOUT YOUR JUSTICE LEAGUE,

39:51.222 --> 39:53.091
AND SHE SAID SHE THOUGHT
IT SOUNDED SILLY,

39:53.124 --> 39:54.893
THE CITY WAS SAFE.

39:54.926 --> 39:58.464
- YEAH, I-I TRIED TO WARN HER.
WOMEN DON'T KNOW.

39:58.497 --> 39:59.731
- RIGHT.

39:59.765 --> 40:00.999
'CAUSE IT WASN'T EVEN
A WEEK LATER,

40:01.032 --> 40:04.870
AND THE SOHO RAPIST
STRUCK FOR THE FIRST TIME.

40:04.903 --> 40:06.538
LESLIE CAME BACK,
AND YOU GOT TO TELL HER

40:06.572 --> 40:09.074
HOW MUCH YOU NEEDED
HER HELP NOW, RIGHT?

40:09.107 --> 40:11.877
- WELL,
THAT MUST'VE BEEN GREAT.

40:11.910 --> 40:13.812
WHEN SHE BECAME
FANTASTICA?

40:13.845 --> 40:15.881
AND UP ON THE ROOF
WITH YOU?

40:15.914 --> 40:18.016
I MEAN, 12:19?

40:18.049 --> 40:19.751
AND ON PATROL
ALL NIGHT LONG?

40:19.785 --> 40:23.889
- YEAH, I--WE WERE PARTNERS,
JUST LIKE YOU TWO.

40:23.922 --> 40:25.457
- AND AS LONG AS THE RAPIST
STAYED OUT THERE,

40:25.491 --> 40:27.959
YOU STAYED AS A TEAM.

40:27.993 --> 40:30.128
- UNTIL HENRY CAME ALONG.

40:30.161 --> 40:33.499
WITH HIS MEETINGS
AND SOUND BITES.

40:33.532 --> 40:35.501
YOU DO ALL THE WORK,

40:35.534 --> 40:37.936
AND THE OTHER GUY GETS THE GIRL,
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE HIGH SCHOOL

40:37.969 --> 40:39.037
ALL OVER AGAIN.

40:39.070 --> 40:41.807
- WELL, N-NO--
- A JERK LIKE THAT?

40:41.840 --> 40:42.841
AND HE'S MARRIED,

40:42.874 --> 40:44.175
AND GOING AROUND GRABBING
WHATEVER ASS HE CAN.

40:44.209 --> 40:45.010
- WHEN'D YOU
FIGURE IT OUT?

40:45.043 --> 40:48.514
OH, WAS IT THE NIGHT
OF THE MARCH?

40:48.547 --> 40:50.916
I MEAN, LESLIE WAS SUPPOSED TO
GO ON PATROL WITH YOU,

40:50.949 --> 40:52.784
BUT SHE LEFT WITH HENRY.

40:52.818 --> 40:55.153
- NO, SHE--
SHE'S NOT LIKE THAT.

40:55.186 --> 40:56.021
- OH, NO?

40:56.054 --> 40:59.090
HEY, STUART,
THAT'S WHY SHE WAS LATE.

40:59.124 --> 41:00.125
SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T
WANT TO COME.

41:00.158 --> 41:01.527
SHE FELT SORRY FOR YOU.

41:01.560 --> 41:02.794
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

41:02.828 --> 41:04.530
- SHE SAID HENRY
WAS MAKING FUN OF YOU.

41:04.563 --> 41:06.965
THEY WERE LAUGHING AT YOU.
- NO. NO...

41:06.998 --> 41:08.199
- AND THAT COPYCAT
A WEEK AGO?

41:08.233 --> 41:10.101
YOU REALLY DID SAVE THAT GIRL,
BUT LESLIE DIDN'T CARE, DID SHE?

41:10.135 --> 41:12.538
- SHUT UP. JUST SHUT UP.

41:12.571 --> 41:14.606
- YOU'RE OUT THERE,
RISKING YOUR LIFE FOR HER,

41:14.640 --> 41:16.107
AND SHE'S SCREWING SOMEONE ELSE!
- NICK--

41:16.141 --> 41:19.545
- YOU GOT SO ANGRY YOU HIT HER
OVER THE HEAD WITH A BRICK!

41:19.578 --> 41:20.946
YOU ALMOST KILLED HER.
DO YOU EVEN REALIZE THAT?

41:20.979 --> 41:24.115
DO YOU REALIZE YOU ALMOST KILLED
THE GIRL YOU LOVE?

41:24.149 --> 41:28.887
- [breathes heavily]

41:31.189 --> 41:33.559
D--

41:33.592 --> 41:39.030
DOES LESLIE KNOW?

41:39.064 --> 41:42.100
WHAT DID SHE SAY
ABOUT ME?

41:45.103 --> 41:47.839
- SHE GAVE UP
THE JUSTICE LEAGUE.

41:47.873 --> 41:49.240
AND I KNOW IT WAS YOU
THAT SET HENRY UP.

41:49.274 --> 41:50.308
YOU WERE THERE
WHEN THEY BEAT HIM UP,

41:50.341 --> 41:51.977
YOU WERE IN HIS CAR.

41:52.010 --> 41:56.982
SHE'S NOT FANTASTICA ANYMORE.
YOU'RE NOT 12:19.

41:57.015 --> 42:00.986
- IT'S OVER, STUART.

42:01.019 --> 42:03.221
- I-I NEVER MEANT
TO HURT HER.

42:03.254 --> 42:07.258
OKAY? I N-NEVER MEANT
TO HURT ANYONE.

42:07.292 --> 42:09.961
ALL I WANTED...

42:09.995 --> 42:14.600
WAS FOR HER TO LOOK AT ME
AND KNOW THAT I WAS A...

42:14.633 --> 42:19.070
A HERO.
