AND, YES,
I RECOGNIZE OUR DAUGHTER.

16:22.682 --> 16:24.682
IT WAS HER IN THE CAR
KISSING SOME DUDE.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.184
THIS IS WHY
SHE WAS SO EAGER

16:26.186 --> 16:27.752
TO GIVE KYLE THE WEEKEND OFF
FROM THEIR RELATIONSHIP.

16:27.754 --> 16:29.354
SHE'S LIVING IT UP
IN OUR DRIVEWAY,

16:29.356 --> 16:32.557
AND THAT POOR GUY IS STUCK
AT A BACHELOR PARTY IN VEGAS.

16:35.794 --> 16:39.263
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M EAGER TO DO?
FORGET ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING.

16:39.265 --> 16:40.865
MANDY HAS TO BE HONEST
WITH KYLE.

16:40.867 --> 16:42.333
HONEY,
WE NEED TO TALK TO HER.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.369
NO. WE NEED
TO STAY OUT OF THIS.

16:44.371 --> 16:46.104
IF SHE IS OVER KYLE,
SHE NEEDS TO TELL HIM.

16:46.106 --> 16:47.638
NO, SHE DOESN'T.
SHE --

16:47.640 --> 16:49.774
MAYBE SHE'S MOVED ON
TO A GUY WITH MORE OF A FUTURE.

16:49.776 --> 16:52.143
WHAT?! SHE COULDN'T SWING
A DEAD CAT

16:52.145 --> 16:54.979
WITHOUT HITTING A GUY
WITH MORE OF A FUTURE.

16:54.981 --> 16:58.349
WE COULD TEST IT OUT IF WE KNEW
WHERE YOU BURIED TIGGER.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.784
OH! YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:59.786 --> 17:01.486
YOU KEEP IT UP,
AND YOU MIGHT JUST JOIN HIM.

17:01.488 --> 17:02.887
I JUST THINK
THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS

17:02.889 --> 17:04.122
THAT SHOULD REMAIN
PRIVATE.

17:07.626 --> 17:09.594
Like that.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.131
HI, KYLE.
WELCOME BACK.

17:13.133 --> 17:15.733
I'VE BEEN COUNTING THE MINUTES
SINCE YOU LEFT,

17:15.735 --> 17:20.905
WHICH HAS BEEN<i> VERY</i> HARD FOR ME
BECAUSE IT'S MATH.

17:20.907 --> 17:22.974
I WISH YOU COULD HAVE COME.
I SAW THIS AMAZING SHOW.

17:22.976 --> 17:24.208
YEAH?

17:24.210 --> 17:25.710
THE DANCERS
ONLY HAD ON TIARAS.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.378
WHOA.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.480
BUT IT DIDN'T SEEM WRONG,
'CAUSE THEY WERE POODLES.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.516
[ Laughing ] OH!

17:31.518 --> 17:34.318
WELL, THOSE POODLES
ARE SOMEBODY'S DAUGHTERS.

17:34.320 --> 17:37.822
YOU, UH -- YOU GET IN
ANY TROUBLE IN VEGAS, KYLE?

17:37.824 --> 17:39.857
WELL, MY COUSIN AND HIS BUDDIES
WENT A LITTLE WILD,

17:39.859 --> 17:41.392
BUT WHY GO TO CLUBS

17:41.394 --> 17:43.995
WHEN YOU CAN WATCH FANCY DOGS
CRUSH A CONGA LINE?

17:45.197 --> 17:47.265
WELL, I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
WHILE YOU WERE GONE,

17:47.267 --> 17:49.033
EXCEPT FOR MISS YOU.

17:49.035 --> 17:50.568
KYLE,
WILL YOU BE A DEAR

17:50.570 --> 17:52.770
AND GET ME A SODA
OUT OF THE FRIDGE IN THE GARAGE?

17:52.772 --> 17:54.572
YEAH, OKAY.

17:54.574 --> 17:58.409
[dear]
UH, FOR THE RECORD, A DEER
COULD NEVER FETCH A SODA.

17:58.411 --> 18:01.145
WHAT YOU NEED AROUND HERE
ARE SOME POODLES.

18:03.348 --> 18:04.916
HONEY...
HMM?

18:04.918 --> 18:06.517
I-IF YOU'RE HAVING
SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT KYLE,

18:06.519 --> 18:07.952
YOU NEED TO BE
HONEST WITH HIM.

18:07.954 --> 18:10.054
WHAT?

18:10.056 --> 18:12.990
WELL, YOUR DAD SAW YOU
KISS THAT GUY IN THE PRIUS.

18:15.194 --> 18:17.728
OH, MY GOD. YOU WERE LOOKING
OUT THE WINDOW, SPYING ON ME?

18:17.730 --> 18:19.430
NO!

18:19.432 --> 18:22.133
I WAS WATCHING A SURVEILLANCE
CAMERA AT LARABEE'S HOUSE.

18:22.135 --> 18:25.236
SERIOUSLY, DAD, THIS IS
SO NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

18:25.238 --> 18:26.537
RIGHT -- WASN'T.

18:26.539 --> 18:29.607
BUT...
CAT'S OUT OF THE BAG NOW.

18:29.609 --> 18:30.541
OH, GOD!

18:30.543 --> 18:31.642
IT'S JUST AN EXPRESSION.

18:31.644 --> 18:33.277
THERE'S SO MANY OF THEM.

18:33.279 --> 18:34.779
MANDY.
HONEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.714
NO. YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S SO UNFAIR THAT I LIVE HERE.

18:36.716 --> 18:38.816
MY FRIENDS ON CAMPUS
GET AWAY WITH WAY WORSE STUFF,

18:38.818 --> 18:40.818
AND THEIR PARENTS
NEVER HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.453
I WANT TO BE
ONE OF THOSE KIND OF PARENTS.

18:42.455 --> 18:43.821
ALL RIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT, SWEETIE?

18:43.823 --> 18:45.556
IT'S NOT THE WORST THING
IN THE WORLD, OKAY?

18:45.558 --> 18:47.391
YOU'RE NOT MARRIED,
Y-YOU'RE NOT ENGAGED,

18:47.393 --> 18:48.960
AND IT WAS JUST A KISS.

18:48.962 --> 18:52.130
RIGHT? IT<i> WAS</i> --
WAS JUST A KISS, RIGHT?

18:52.132 --> 18:53.264
HERE YOU ARE.

18:53.266 --> 18:54.799
AH. KYLE.
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:54.801 --> 18:56.334
I-I ACTUALLY WANTED
A CREAM SODA.

18:56.336 --> 18:58.002
UH, I THINK
THERE'S ONE IN THE FRIDGE

18:58.004 --> 18:59.337
WAY, WAY, WAY
IN THE BACK.

18:59.339 --> 19:01.005
OH.
WISH YOU'D TOLD ME.

19:01.007 --> 19:03.508
I'M NOT A MIND READER.

19:03.510 --> 19:07.245
UNLIKE THAT BULLDOG
WITH THE CRYSTAL BALL.

19:07.247 --> 19:09.013
MANDY, HONEY,
WHAT IS GOING ON?

19:09.015 --> 19:10.014
NOTHING.

19:10.016 --> 19:11.015
MANDY, COME ON.

19:11.017 --> 19:12.483
OKAY.

19:12.485 --> 19:15.319
THERE WAS THIS FASHION EXHIBIT
AT THE ART MUSEUM,

19:15.321 --> 19:17.455
AND THIS GUY IN MY CLASS
ASKED ME OUT,

19:17.457 --> 19:20.291
AND I-I FIGURED
THAT ONE DATE COULDN'T HURT,

19:20.293 --> 19:22.793
ESPECIALLY IF KYLE WAS
GETTING THE SAME DEAL.

19:22.795 --> 19:25.096
I WAS JUST...CURIOUS.

19:25.098 --> 19:27.165
CURIOUS, HUH?

19:27.167 --> 19:29.400
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY
CURIOSITY KILLED?

19:33.372 --> 19:36.474
I ENDED UP THINKING ABOUT KYLE
THE WHOLE TIME ANYWAY,

19:36.476 --> 19:38.609
EVEN WHEN
THAT DUDE WAS KISSING ME.

19:38.611 --> 19:41.712
WELL, YOU WENT OUT WITH A GUY
FROM THE FASHION CLASS.

19:41.714 --> 19:44.582
<i>HE</i> WAS PROBABLY
THINKING ABOUT KYLE, TOO.

19:45.817 --> 19:47.518
BUT THAT GUY,
HE DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING TO ME.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.487
I JUST HOPE THAT I HAVEN'T
SCREWED EVERYTHING UP.

19:49.489 --> 19:51.522
ALL RIGHT, WELL, I THINK WE ALL
KNOW WHAT YOU NEED TO DO.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.191
YEAH, I DO.
I HAVE TO TELL HIM.
ABSOLUTELY.

19:53.193 --> 19:55.126
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
OH. OH. NO, I KNOW.

19:55.128 --> 19:56.561
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.
WHAT ARE YOU TELLING --
NO, YEAH, NO.

19:56.563 --> 19:57.995
YOUR IDEA IS TO PRETEND
IT NEVER HAPPENED

19:57.997 --> 19:59.330
AND JUST FORGET ABOUT IT --
IS THAT IT?

19:59.332 --> 20:00.798
WHAT'S THE GOOD
OF HER TELLING HIM?

20:00.800 --> 20:02.533
MAKES HER FEEL BETTER
AND HE FEELS HORRIBLE.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.402
HE'S A DEPRESSED GUY
WALKING AROUND MY STORE.

20:04.404 --> 20:06.470
WE HAVE GUNS THERE.

20:06.472 --> 20:10.675
DAD, IF I DON'T TELL KYLE,
I'M GONNA FEEL HORRIBLE.

20:10.677 --> 20:13.077
WELL, MAYBE YOU<i> SHOULD.</i>

20:14.379 --> 20:17.348
HEY, MRS. B.
I COULDN'T FIND A CREAM SODA.

20:17.350 --> 20:18.716
YEAH, UH, DON'T WORRY.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.651
IT'S, UH --
IT'S TIME FOR WINE ANYWAY.

20:20.653 --> 20:22.753
KYLE, I NEED
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

20:22.755 --> 20:23.821
YEAH, WHAT IS IT?

20:25.891 --> 20:26.824
UM...

20:29.061 --> 20:30.194
[ CHUCKLES ]

20:30.196 --> 20:31.395
I LOVE YOU.

20:31.397 --> 20:33.431
DON'T EVER GO AWAY
AGAIN.

20:33.433 --> 20:34.899
[ BOTH CHUCKLE ]

20:34.901 --> 20:36.601
WELL, I'M NOT GOING BACK
TO VEGAS ANYTIME SOON.

20:36.603 --> 20:37.835
GOOD.

20:37.837 --> 20:39.770
OH, AND I, UH,
LOST THAT 20 BUCKS

20:39.772 --> 20:41.439
YOU ASKED ME
TO BET FOR YOU.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.107
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
THE HOUSE ALWAYS WINS.

20:43.109 --> 20:44.942
OH, NO,
I-I DIDN'T LOSE IT LIKE THAT.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.711
I DROPPED IT
RUNNING FOR MY LIFE.

20:46.713 --> 20:48.012
WHAT?

20:48.014 --> 20:49.780
YEAH, I'M GOING
IN THIS CASINO --

20:49.782 --> 20:51.449
A VOLCANO ERUPTED.

20:54.553 --> 20:58.623
YEAH, I GRABBED A COUPLE
LITTLE KIDS AND TOOK OFF.
