No, Jaime,
you're not here to listen to my bullshit all day.

19:55.570 --> 19:57.936
How are you, huh?
How you doing? How's your dog?

19:58.156 --> 20:00.147
-Dog's doing fine.
-You know what I read the other day?

20:00.241 --> 20:01.447
This is fucked up.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.570
It's a myth that dogs are color-blind.

20:05.246 --> 20:07.862
You know, maybe you'd be better off
without this Spencer guy.

20:07.957 --> 20:09.822
-No, no, no.
-Just saying, Joe.

20:09.959 --> 20:12.871
You got to embrace the freedom
that comes with being your own boss.

20:13.421 --> 20:16.163
I mean, look at me. Don't I look happy?

20:18.259 --> 20:19.635
Anyways, I got to run, dude.

20:19.803 --> 20:21.293
-PiCk up Grandma.
-Yeah.

20:21.388 --> 20:23.128
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

20:24.140 --> 20:25.346
AII right. (SIGHS)

20:26.518 --> 20:27.724
Man.

20:28.311 --> 20:29.300
Call me.

20:29.479 --> 20:30.889
-Drive safe.
-JAIME: Yeah.

20:32.148 --> 20:33.809
(CROWD CHEERING)

20:41.324 --> 20:42.564
SPENCER: You got a great kid.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.483
DAN: We can cut the bullshit now, dude.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.155
Just tell me what's on your mind.

20:49.999 --> 20:51.034
Okay.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.375
I meant to hurt you that day.

20:56.339 --> 21:00.048
I mean, you were completely exposed.
I could have pulled back, but I didn't.

21:00.135 --> 21:02.000
Instead, I Chose to light you the fuck up.

21:02.470 --> 21:05.462
I make no apologies about it.
It's the type of player I was back then.

21:05.598 --> 21:06.849
I'm well aware of that.

21:07.100 --> 21:09.466
It's football. Players are aware of the risks.

21:09.561 --> 21:11.097
What if it was you that got laid out?

21:11.563 --> 21:14.179
Would you want a handshake,
a "no hard feelings"?

21:14.441 --> 21:15.977
Some show of respect?

21:16.526 --> 21:18.357
Dan, I didn't have that in me back then.

21:18.528 --> 21:21.520
I took that hit, I put it in a box
and I buried that motherfucker.

21:21.614 --> 21:22.899
That was it. I moved on.

21:23.032 --> 21:25.409
And for whatever reason, after I retired,

21:25.869 --> 21:27.234
that moment's been haunting me.

21:29.038 --> 21:30.244
Look, I know I'm late.

21:30.373 --> 21:31.783
I'm just trying to make it right.

21:34.544 --> 21:35.704
You did me a favor.

21:37.046 --> 21:38.297
Don't say that, man.

21:38.590 --> 21:39.830
I've been dining out on the idea

21:39.924 --> 21:42.301
you robbed me of my Chance
at greatness for years,

21:42.385 --> 21:46.048
telling everyone Spencer Strasmore was dirty,

21:46.848 --> 21:50.887
when the reality was
I was a great college player,

21:52.437 --> 21:54.553
but I was a below-average pro.

21:54.772 --> 21:56.478
Come on, man.
You made it to the highest level.

21:56.566 --> 21:58.227
Six teams in eight years.

21:58.359 --> 21:59.860
Man, it got to the point
where I stopped making friends

21:59.944 --> 22:02.606
'cause I knew I wouldn't be around long
enough to remember everybody's name.

22:02.697 --> 22:04.483
-You never had that problem, did you?
-No.

22:04.574 --> 22:07.065
In all my time in the league,
I never scored a TD,

22:08.161 --> 22:10.777
played in a playoff game,
had a single moment of glory.

22:10.914 --> 22:13.246
Not a Cheer from the crowd.

22:15.793 --> 22:16.999
Nothing.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.290
Nothing.

22:21.966 --> 22:24.457
I was Chasing something
I was never gonna get.

22:26.638 --> 22:28.879
I was done when we met, Spencer.

22:30.475 --> 22:32.215
I mean, do I miss football? Yeah.

22:32.977 --> 22:35.093
But that hit
that you've been losing sleep over,

22:35.772 --> 22:37.433
that was a straight-up mercy kill.

22:41.611 --> 22:42.942
I've never told that to anyone.

22:45.782 --> 22:46.942
(CHUCKLES)

22:50.578 --> 22:52.614
-(GROANS)
-(SIGHS)

22:59.170 --> 23:01.001
Better than talking to a shrink.

23:01.214 --> 23:02.704
A hell of a lot Cheaper, too.

23:03.341 --> 23:04.956
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

23:08.429 --> 23:10.966
Check it out. Check it out. Giancarlo Stanton.

23:11.224 --> 23:13.385
Giancarlo! Whoo!

23:13.560 --> 23:14.845

23:15.103 --> 23:16.309
Come on, I'll introduce you.

23:16.854 --> 23:18.469
-Seriously?
-Yeah, that's my boy.

23:18.606 --> 23:21.393
But I won't introduce you
as my fucking plumber, by the way.

23:21.901 --> 23:24.142
Adam. Adam. Come on.

23:24.737 --> 23:25.897
-SPENCER: What's up, brother?
-What's up, man?

23:25.989 --> 23:27.650
-Good to see you.
-Good to see you, too. How's it going?

23:27.740 --> 23:28.729
Everything is good.

23:28.825 --> 23:30.656
This is one of your biggest fans,
Dan Balsamo.

23:30.743 --> 23:31.732
Dan, what's going on, man?

23:31.828 --> 23:32.783
-Great to meet you.
-Good to meet you.

23:32.870 --> 23:33.996
All right, and this is the big man right here.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.069
GIANCARLO: What's up, little man?

23:35.164 --> 23:36.574
-How you doing?
-37 home runs.

23:36.666 --> 23:39.954
-And counting.
-Oh! Look at you. You know your stats.

23:40.295 --> 23:41.751
Want me to sign this? All right.

23:42.005 --> 23:43.745
Hey, how'd it go?

23:43.840 --> 23:45.125
You didn't text me.

23:45.216 --> 23:46.331
Mmm.

23:46.426 --> 23:47.757
No word just yet.

23:48.678 --> 23:49.838
Baby, what happened?

23:50.555 --> 23:52.546
What drills did you run?
You do some pass sets?

23:52.724 --> 23:54.510
Oh, yeah. A bunch of those.

23:54.684 --> 23:55.890
Some punch drills.

23:57.228 --> 23:59.514
Okay, I want to know more. Was Siefert cool?

23:59.689 --> 24:01.930
Did you tell him how my aunt grew up
in the same town as his mom?

24:02.025 --> 24:03.731
No, I didn't get a Chance to do that, baby.

24:03.818 --> 24:05.274
He was kind of busy screaming at me.

24:05.361 --> 24:06.942
The GM was screaming at you?

24:07.071 --> 24:09.062
Mmm. Yeah.

24:09.157 --> 24:10.943
It was a different side of him
I never seen before.

24:11.034 --> 24:14.117
He, uh, kept calling me "SugarTits."

24:15.622 --> 24:17.158
A nickname is a good sign.

24:18.666 --> 24:20.076
I really think I blew it.

24:20.293 --> 24:23.581
Everybody counted on me to get it back
and ljust landed square on my ass.

24:23.921 --> 24:25.297
Oh, baby, it couldn't have been that bad.

24:25.548 --> 24:27.539
No, I literally landed on my ass.

24:27.634 --> 24:28.749
Like right on it.

24:29.010 --> 24:30.045
Right on your ass?

24:30.178 --> 24:31.213
(EXCLAIMS)

24:31.304 --> 24:32.510
Aw, shoot.

24:33.348 --> 24:36.181
Look, nobody wanted
this comeback for you more than I did.

24:36.267 --> 24:38.428
You know that. I'm sorry, baby.

24:39.187 --> 24:42.725
But I do have some news
that might ease some of that pain.

24:42.857 --> 24:44.393
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

24:44.484 --> 24:46.395
I was supposed to have
my period a while ago and I didn't,

24:46.486 --> 24:48.977
so I took one of these and... Barn.

24:49.864 --> 24:51.149

Yes, I'm sure.

24:58.247 --> 24:59.453
So I'm gonna be a daddy?

25:00.041 --> 25:02.202
Yes. Ooh! Daddy.

25:02.293 --> 25:03.874
I like that way more than Sugar Tits.

25:04.045 --> 25:05.330

25:07.965 --> 25:09.000
