WEBVTT

03:19.689 --> 03:20.858
Are we there yet?

03:23.326 --> 03:25.227
Not yet.

03:25.261 --> 03:26.430
Almost.

03:29.531 --> 03:30.867
I'm not having this
conversation.

03:30.899 --> 03:32.468
Theo's in the car.

03:32.501 --> 03:33.737
You need to come back.

03:33.769 --> 03:35.471
- No.
- Allison,

03:35.505 --> 03:36.806
you have to come back.

03:36.838 --> 03:38.441
I'm not coming back.

03:39.676 --> 03:41.644
We're never coming back.

03:41.677 --> 03:42.578
Stop.

03:42.612 --> 03:44.914
Allison, come back now for
Theo's sake.

03:44.947 --> 03:46.183
For Theo's sake?

03:46.215 --> 03:47.617
I'm protecting him.

03:47.649 --> 03:48.551
Protecting him?

03:48.584 --> 03:50.452
Allison, you can't even take
care of him.

03:50.486 --> 03:52.388
You can barely take care of
yourself.

03:55.325 --> 03:56.760
Fuck you.

03:56.792 --> 03:58.327
Allison, you're not doing well.

03:58.361 --> 03:59.696
Let me help you.

03:59.729 --> 04:00.564
I'm fine.

04:00.596 --> 04:01.564
Theo's fine.

04:01.598 --> 04:02.565
We're fine.

04:02.599 --> 04:03.566
You know you
shouldn't be doing this.

04:03.600 --> 04:04.434
Tell me where you are.

04:04.468 --> 04:06.403
For the last time, leave us
alone.

04:29.691 --> 04:31.828
Are we there yet?

04:38.934 --> 04:40.504
You can do this, Allison.

04:45.908 --> 04:47.376
You can do this.

04:51.446 --> 04:52.715
You can do this.

05:55.744 --> 05:56.744
Hello?

05:58.747 --> 05:59.747
Hello?

06:03.720 --> 06:04.720
Hello?

06:06.723 --> 06:07.723
Wait here.

06:08.725 --> 06:09.725
Hi.

06:09.759 --> 06:11.360
You must be Allison key.

06:11.393 --> 06:12.095
I'm George.

06:12.127 --> 06:12.995
Nice to meet you.

06:13.028 --> 06:13.862
Hi.

06:13.896 --> 06:14.730
Yes.

06:14.763 --> 06:15.898
And this is Theo.

06:15.932 --> 06:17.066
Oh.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.769
Do you like candy, hm?

06:20.802 --> 06:21.802
Here you go.

06:22.704 --> 06:23.973
Oh, no?

06:24.641 --> 06:27.076
I thought we could be friends.

06:27.910 --> 06:28.578
I'm sorry.

06:28.610 --> 06:30.379
He can be shy around new people.

06:31.614 --> 06:32.849
Ah, that's all right.

06:32.881 --> 06:33.550
Come on.

06:33.583 --> 06:34.917
I'll give you the 10 cent tour.

06:37.018 --> 06:38.018
Theo.

06:41.424 --> 06:42.424
Come on.

06:44.893 --> 06:45.893
Oh.

06:47.829 --> 06:50.666
Right down here is the basement.

06:50.699 --> 06:52.368
It's great for storage.

06:52.401 --> 06:55.838
And I bet you could make an
amazing fort right down there.

06:56.506 --> 06:58.408
And moving on.

07:11.086 --> 07:12.088
The living room.

07:19.461 --> 07:21.997
Oh, you were so desperate to
move in

07:22.030 --> 07:24.701
that the cleaning crew hasn't
been in yet.

07:28.069 --> 07:29.069
Or ever.

07:38.146 --> 07:39.146
Dining room.

07:40.516 --> 07:42.552
And, well, this.

07:44.220 --> 07:48.758
And this is my favorite
room in the entire house.

07:48.790 --> 07:51.194
Now, I'm sure that you can
agree that with a kitchen

07:51.227 --> 07:55.699
like this, that this will
be the heart of your home.

07:57.133 --> 08:01.905
And your son and yourself
will have many fond memories.

08:02.537 --> 08:05.574
There's a problem with the
stove,

08:05.607 --> 08:08.511
and I'll have a handyman come
have a look.

08:08.544 --> 08:11.415
And he'll spray for bugs too,
right?

08:12.915 --> 08:13.917
I'll look into it.

08:14.984 --> 08:20.457
Well, I'm sure you wanna get
settled, so I'll be going.

08:28.530 --> 08:29.530
Oh.

08:30.966 --> 08:34.771
Allison key, you're gonna need
this.

08:39.876 --> 08:41.977
Aw, sweetie.

08:42.011 --> 08:44.680
I know this place can be
overwhelming,

08:45.548 --> 08:46.750
but give it a few days.

08:52.554 --> 08:53.957
You're gonna feel much better.

09:26.756 --> 09:28.257
Mommy.

09:28.290 --> 09:29.290
Theo?

09:30.626 --> 09:31.626
Theo?

09:32.761 --> 09:33.929
Theo?

09:33.963 --> 09:35.030
Theo?

09:50.579 --> 09:52.081
Isn't this funny?

09:58.054 --> 09:59.689
Yes, this is funny.

10:03.092 --> 10:05.061
There you go, my lady.

10:05.093 --> 10:06.795
Thank you, my lord.

10:06.828 --> 10:09.665
You're welcome, your highness.

10:17.106 --> 10:20.010
Are you okay, mommy?

10:20.977 --> 10:22.913
I just need some air.

11:51.333 --> 11:53.969
I'll go get the bags, then
I'll make dinner, sport.

13:10.011 --> 13:11.011
Hello?

13:18.053 --> 13:20.123
Okay, time for bed.

13:21.824 --> 13:23.492
But it's only eight o'clock.

13:23.525 --> 13:25.828
But it's late enough.

13:25.861 --> 13:27.429
But I want to explore.

13:27.463 --> 13:29.799
And you can explore more
tomorrow.

13:35.036 --> 13:35.905
Please?

13:35.938 --> 13:36.938
No.

13:41.376 --> 13:42.344
Please?

13:42.377 --> 13:43.780
Come on.

13:55.256 --> 13:56.258
There we go.

13:56.659 --> 14:00.163
There you go, buddy, just
as snug as a bug in a rug.

14:00.195 --> 14:02.964
Are bugs actually snug in rugs?

14:02.997 --> 14:04.900
That is a great question.

14:04.934 --> 14:05.568
I don't know.

14:05.601 --> 14:07.136
It's just a saying.

14:07.169 --> 14:08.804
All right, lights out, slugger.

14:13.876 --> 14:15.410
Can you please check my room?

14:16.612 --> 14:17.612
Of course.

14:20.348 --> 14:21.516
Where should I begin?

14:21.550 --> 14:23.152
Check under the bed.

14:24.053 --> 14:25.053
Under the bed.

14:27.122 --> 14:30.526
No monsters here, I am happy to
report.

14:32.594 --> 14:34.329
Check behind the curtains.

14:34.362 --> 14:35.497
- The curtains?
- Yes.

14:39.868 --> 14:41.403
No monsters there either.

14:44.073 --> 14:45.241
Check the closet.

14:45.274 --> 14:49.445
The closet, that's a good
place for a monster to hide.

14:58.887 --> 15:00.889
Well, monsters would get stuck
in there.

15:10.131 --> 15:12.401
I dutifully report no monsters.

15:19.174 --> 15:20.876
No monster, just a bottle.

15:24.413 --> 15:25.413
It can't hurt you.

15:35.790 --> 15:39.628
The only monster here is a
tickle monster.

15:39.661 --> 15:40.495
Stop.

15:40.529 --> 15:41.529
Stop.

15:42.665 --> 15:43.366
All right.

15:43.399 --> 15:45.101
- Ready for lights out?
- Yes.

15:45.133 --> 15:45.867
All right.

15:45.901 --> 15:47.302
- I love you.
- I love you too.

16:12.627 --> 16:14.362
Hey, buddy.

16:14.396 --> 16:16.498
I know it's late, but we gotta
go get mom.

16:17.466 --> 16:18.466
Again?

16:20.368 --> 16:21.368
Yeah, I know.

16:22.304 --> 16:23.238
But it'll be short this time,

16:23.271 --> 16:26.074
and you'll be back in your bed
in no time.

16:29.311 --> 16:32.581
I got something that'll cheer
you up.

16:47.161 --> 16:50.465
I got this on our last trip to
Rochester.

16:51.567 --> 16:53.402
You know I love you, right?

16:53.434 --> 16:54.636
I'll always be there for you.

16:54.670 --> 16:57.173
Even if I can't, this guy will,
okay?

17:01.709 --> 17:03.378
All right, let's go get mom now.

17:13.055 --> 17:14.332
It's always someone else's
fault.

17:14.356 --> 17:16.325
I don't wanna have this fight
again.

17:16.357 --> 17:18.626
I'm tired of having the
same conversation with you.

17:18.659 --> 17:20.562
They aren't your friends.

17:20.596 --> 17:21.664
The school called.

17:21.696 --> 17:23.507
I'm tired of having the
same conversation with you.

17:23.531 --> 17:25.100
You're a mean, aren't your
friends.

17:25.134 --> 17:26.035
The school called.

17:26.069 --> 17:28.104
It's always someone else's fault
with you.

17:28.136 --> 17:29.304
- You're a mean... mommy!

17:32.107 --> 17:33.107
Mommy!

17:36.578 --> 17:38.982
Mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy!

17:41.482 --> 17:43.219
Mommy, mommy, mommy!

17:50.392 --> 17:52.228
What happened?

17:52.261 --> 17:53.529
I had a nightmare.

17:55.097 --> 17:55.731
I'm sorry.

17:55.763 --> 17:57.198
That must've been awful.

17:57.232 --> 17:58.232
It was.

17:59.334 --> 18:00.703
Do you wanna talk about it?

18:01.537 --> 18:06.675
We were in the car, not
this one, the old one.

18:06.707 --> 18:08.209
He was there.

18:08.242 --> 18:09.444
He was mad.

18:11.180 --> 18:12.515
Then, he was gone.

18:14.450 --> 18:15.751
Then, I woke up.

18:18.553 --> 18:20.589
It was just a dream, I promise.

18:23.591 --> 18:24.793
It was so real.

18:26.127 --> 18:28.396
You want me to sleep with you
tonight?

18:28.430 --> 18:31.367
Okay.

18:35.671 --> 18:36.671
Come here.

19:10.539 --> 19:11.540
Hey.

19:11.572 --> 19:12.407
We need to talk.

19:12.441 --> 19:13.309
You need to come back.

19:13.341 --> 19:14.242
No.

19:14.276 --> 19:15.077
Leave us alone.

19:15.109 --> 19:18.113
Allison, you cannot outrun this.

19:18.146 --> 19:18.880
Come home.

19:18.914 --> 19:20.816
I'm never coming back.

19:20.848 --> 19:22.650
Tell me where you are.

19:22.684 --> 19:24.353
Never.

19:24.386 --> 19:26.321
Allison, I care about you.

19:26.355 --> 19:27.390
I'll come get you.

19:28.322 --> 19:30.191
I'll bring you back.

19:30.224 --> 19:31.394
Leave me alone.

19:38.533 --> 19:39.635
Morning, sunshine.

19:41.369 --> 19:42.369
Good morning.

19:48.176 --> 19:50.378
Mommy, I don't understand this.

19:52.513 --> 19:53.513
Let me see.

19:57.351 --> 19:59.521
Hoo, well, that's a tough one.

20:01.190 --> 20:01.891
I don't get it.

20:01.924 --> 20:02.758
He's huge.

20:02.790 --> 20:05.160
Why does he not run?

20:05.194 --> 20:06.395
When elephants are small,

20:06.427 --> 20:08.396
they put a big chain around
their foot,

20:08.430 --> 20:11.567
and it's stuck in a stake in the
ground,

20:11.599 --> 20:16.539
and try as they might, and
they do 'cause they're young

20:16.571 --> 20:20.309
and strong, they're just
not big enough to break it.

20:20.341 --> 20:21.486
So, by the time they're that
big,

20:21.510 --> 20:25.213
it doesn't matter if it's
just a little piece of rope,

20:25.246 --> 20:29.251
they just don't try to get away
anymore.

20:30.719 --> 20:32.421
His spirit's broken.

20:32.453 --> 20:34.857
He just doesn't have a
reason to fight anymore.

20:36.625 --> 20:38.861
Poor elephant, he's trapped
forever.

20:47.735 --> 20:49.972
What do you say we go explore?

20:50.004 --> 20:51.004
Yes.

21:22.337 --> 21:24.473
Ready or not, here I come.

21:29.344 --> 21:32.815
Where could he be?

21:33.948 --> 21:35.684
Got you.

21:37.519 --> 21:38.621
Your turn to count, okay?

21:39.988 --> 21:41.557
No peeking.

21:41.589 --> 21:42.589
Meow.

21:45.993 --> 21:48.897
Did you really just put that
there?

21:52.466 --> 21:53.434
One.

21:53.467 --> 21:54.469
Two.

21:54.502 --> 21:55.637
Three.

21:55.671 --> 21:56.838
Four.

21:56.871 --> 21:57.705
Five.

21:57.739 --> 21:58.707
Six.

21:58.740 --> 21:59.907
Seven.

21:59.941 --> 22:00.843
Eight.

22:00.876 --> 22:01.710
Nine.

22:01.742 --> 22:02.742
10.

22:04.879 --> 22:05.880
Here I come.

22:07.316 --> 22:08.451
There you are.

22:09.885 --> 22:11.020
There you are.

22:16.425 --> 22:17.559
I got you now.

22:22.030 --> 22:23.699
I'll get you next time.

22:25.533 --> 22:26.434
Will you do me a favor and wait

22:26.469 --> 22:28.771
in the dining room while I check
the door?

22:29.570 --> 22:30.570
Thank you.

22:42.384 --> 22:43.384
Just a minute.

22:50.959 --> 22:51.959
Who is it?

22:53.595 --> 22:55.864
Ma'am, my name is Jack Turner.

22:55.896 --> 22:56.898
I'm the handyman.

22:56.932 --> 22:58.034
Your landlord sent me.

22:59.401 --> 23:00.469
What are you here for?

23:00.501 --> 23:02.870
George said something
about your heat not working,

23:02.904 --> 23:04.006
and that you got bugs.

23:09.845 --> 23:10.679
Hi.

23:10.713 --> 23:12.514
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Come on in.

23:18.587 --> 23:19.754
I'm Jack.

23:19.788 --> 23:20.455
Allison.

23:20.489 --> 23:21.990
And please don't call me ma'am.

23:22.022 --> 23:23.022
No problem.

23:34.069 --> 23:36.372
Oh, shit, I am sorry.

23:36.405 --> 23:38.406
I'll help you clean up the
broken glass.

23:39.741 --> 23:41.609
That must've been here from
before.

23:59.994 --> 24:01.097
Here, I'll take that.

24:02.196 --> 24:03.799
George said you needed the place
quickly,

24:03.831 --> 24:06.635
but he's usually pretty good
about keeping it in order.

24:07.601 --> 24:08.803
Really?

24:08.837 --> 24:10.046
Yeah, the last tenants just up
and left

24:10.070 --> 24:11.674
in the middle of the night.

24:12.407 --> 24:15.410
It's a pretty sad story all
around.

24:15.444 --> 24:16.444
What happened?

24:17.745 --> 24:20.549
A man moved in here
with his little girl.

24:20.581 --> 24:22.984
I think he was a scientist or
something.

24:23.018 --> 24:26.856
But he was pretty much out of
it by the time he moved in.

24:28.223 --> 24:30.158
His little girl was
diagnosed with brain cancer.

24:30.192 --> 24:31.493
Ugh, that's horrible.

24:32.494 --> 24:36.799
Yeah, I mean, this man
tried everything to cure her.

24:36.831 --> 24:39.534
He moved here for the children's
hospital down the road.

24:39.568 --> 24:41.703
He tried everything, and nothing
worked.

24:43.637 --> 24:45.174
God, what do you think happened?

24:48.976 --> 24:52.213
George said something
about them moving to Mexico

24:52.246 --> 24:53.981
as a last-ditch effort.

24:54.014 --> 24:57.018
Something about scorpion
venom curing cancer?

24:57.051 --> 24:58.619
Scorpion venom?

24:58.653 --> 25:00.055
Yeah, I don't know.

25:00.088 --> 25:02.857
I met him a couple
times, but the last times

25:02.890 --> 25:05.726
that he was here, that's
all he talked about.

25:05.760 --> 25:08.063
I think he just kinda
started losing his mind

25:08.096 --> 25:10.031
as his daughter got sicker and
sicker.

25:11.566 --> 25:13.168
Here, let's get rid of this,

25:13.201 --> 25:15.004
and we'll get the rest in a
minute.

25:21.209 --> 25:23.479
Well, I hope they're doing okay.

25:24.212 --> 25:25.212
I really do.

25:25.981 --> 25:27.683
Yeah, I do too.

25:29.917 --> 25:32.154
Well, look who decided to join
us.

25:33.120 --> 25:34.155
Who are you?

25:35.155 --> 25:37.926
Theo, this is...

25:38.960 --> 25:39.960
Jack.

25:41.296 --> 25:42.565
It's nice to meet you.

25:45.200 --> 25:46.200
Say hello.

25:47.636 --> 25:48.270
I'm sorry.

25:48.302 --> 25:49.704
He can be so shy.

25:49.738 --> 25:50.572
It's okay.

25:50.605 --> 25:51.640
I was a shy kid too.

25:54.742 --> 25:56.979
That must've been here.

25:57.011 --> 25:58.113
Right, must've been.

25:59.614 --> 26:01.183
When is the cleaning crew
coming?

26:01.849 --> 26:03.685
They should be here tomorrow.

26:04.586 --> 26:05.521
Not fast enough.

26:05.553 --> 26:07.555
What do you say we start
with the bugs, huh?

26:07.588 --> 26:09.058
I hate bugs.

26:10.559 --> 26:11.559
Yes, ma'am.

26:12.260 --> 26:14.029
Um, not ma'am.

26:14.061 --> 26:15.497
Please call me Allison.

27:07.982 --> 27:09.850
So, there's a small crack
right there.

27:09.884 --> 27:12.120
I'll spray it and then patch it
up.

27:12.153 --> 27:13.956
Looks big enough for a
cockroach.

27:16.657 --> 27:18.126
So, how old was the girl?

27:19.293 --> 27:20.293
The sick girl?

27:21.629 --> 27:23.331
Probably a little bit older than
your son.

27:27.368 --> 27:31.839
I can't imagine what that
poor father was going through.

28:32.966 --> 28:35.436
It looks like they burrowed
through the baseboard.

28:35.470 --> 28:37.739
So, timeline on fixing that?

28:37.771 --> 28:39.174
It should be done tomorrow.

28:39.206 --> 28:40.274
Let me out, let me out.

28:40.308 --> 28:42.211
- Theo?
- Mommy, mommy, help.

28:43.411 --> 28:45.780
Help, help, help, help.

28:45.813 --> 28:47.148
Theo?

28:47.182 --> 28:48.183
- Theo?
- Help.

28:48.616 --> 28:50.685
I'm coming, hang on.

28:51.251 --> 28:52.251
Help

28:52.488 --> 28:53.989
- ma'am.
- Allison.

28:55.723 --> 28:57.126
- I'm right here.
- Help.

28:57.992 --> 28:58.992
Hang on, Theo.

29:00.261 --> 29:02.431
- Help, help.
- Theo, I'm right here.

29:03.464 --> 29:04.464
Hang in there.

29:06.467 --> 29:08.102
You're okay.

29:08.136 --> 29:09.405
You're okay now.

29:11.205 --> 29:12.205
I know.

29:29.156 --> 29:31.193
Don't go down there.

29:31.225 --> 29:32.260
It's okay, buddy.

29:32.292 --> 29:34.328
I'm just gonna go take a look.

29:34.361 --> 29:36.098
There's something down there.

29:37.030 --> 29:38.366
You have a fierce grip.

29:38.398 --> 29:39.410
I'm just gonna take a look.

29:39.434 --> 29:40.268
Please don't.

29:40.300 --> 29:41.435
I heard something.

29:41.469 --> 29:42.771
It's an old house.

29:42.803 --> 29:43.938
It's probably just settling.

29:43.972 --> 29:45.473
Something was moving.

29:45.507 --> 29:47.342
It was probably just a bug.

29:47.375 --> 29:49.511
It was bigger than a bug.

29:49.543 --> 29:51.479
It was probably a really big
bug.

29:53.047 --> 29:54.049
Come on.

29:54.081 --> 29:55.751
Theo.

29:55.783 --> 29:56.783
I'll make cocoa.

30:03.223 --> 30:04.960
Come on, I'll make you some
cocoa.

31:58.039 --> 32:00.142
I wanted marshmallows.

32:54.494 --> 32:55.996
Are you all right?

32:56.030 --> 32:57.098
It was just a rat.

32:57.832 --> 33:00.401
Don't worry, I'll take care of
it.

33:00.434 --> 33:01.470
I have to get a cage.

33:41.242 --> 33:42.978
Spaghetti or soup?

33:51.685 --> 33:53.021
Spaghetti or soup?

33:54.055 --> 33:55.055
Neither.

33:58.559 --> 33:59.728
What is this?

33:59.761 --> 34:00.761
That's not right.

34:03.731 --> 34:05.166
It looks more like that.

34:08.536 --> 34:10.205
But what is it?

34:10.238 --> 34:12.040
That's the thing in the
basement.

34:13.040 --> 34:13.941
No.

34:13.975 --> 34:16.178
Jack said it's just a rat in the
basement.

34:17.310 --> 34:19.146
These don't look rats.

34:19.180 --> 34:21.182
It's way bigger than a rat.

34:21.214 --> 34:23.151
So, it's not a rat.

34:23.184 --> 34:25.586
Maybe with a little imagination,

34:25.620 --> 34:28.455
that's what a rat could look
like,

34:28.488 --> 34:33.494
but this is far scarier than
just a rat in the basement.

34:34.428 --> 34:35.564
I know what I saw.

36:05.153 --> 36:06.153
Help!

36:10.290 --> 36:12.693
Mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy!

36:12.727 --> 36:13.727
Help!

36:14.162 --> 36:15.296
Help!

36:23.504 --> 36:24.504
Help!

36:25.872 --> 36:27.608
Mommy, mommy, mommy!

36:30.443 --> 36:31.443
Help!

36:32.713 --> 36:34.883
Mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy!

36:43.256 --> 36:44.256
Help!

36:53.868 --> 36:54.802
What happened?

36:54.834 --> 36:57.171
The monster was here.

36:59.941 --> 37:01.910
There's a monster?

37:01.943 --> 37:04.444
Oh my god, what happened?

37:04.477 --> 37:06.380
The monster was here.

37:07.847 --> 37:08.481
Come on.

37:08.515 --> 37:10.684
We gotta get you cleaned up.

37:27.702 --> 37:29.638
Theo.

37:29.970 --> 37:31.271
Theo, please let me in.

37:31.305 --> 37:33.575
You never protect me.

37:33.607 --> 37:36.310
I'll protect myself.

37:36.343 --> 37:37.244
Please.

37:37.278 --> 37:38.278
No.

37:41.448 --> 37:42.082
Fine.

37:42.117 --> 37:43.584
Then, I'll sleep right here.

38:49.617 --> 38:51.452
Hey, come sit here, sweetie.

39:06.033 --> 39:08.502
I want to go home.

39:08.535 --> 39:09.604
We are home.

39:09.636 --> 39:11.872
I don't like it here.

39:12.772 --> 39:15.443
Well, you're just gonna
have to get used to it.

39:16.510 --> 39:17.778
I want to leave.

39:18.778 --> 39:20.013
We can't leave.

39:20.046 --> 39:21.615
Where would we go anyway?

39:21.649 --> 39:23.851
We don't have anywhere to go.

39:23.883 --> 39:25.352
What about grandma's?

39:26.687 --> 39:27.955
We can't go to grandma's.

39:28.955 --> 39:29.955
Why?

39:30.191 --> 39:31.893
Because it's complicated.

39:33.861 --> 39:35.730
I hate this place.

40:02.622 --> 40:04.024
That's a pretty big cage.

40:04.057 --> 40:05.859
It's a pretty big rat.

40:05.892 --> 40:07.561
Hoo, uh, well, good luck.

40:07.595 --> 40:08.562
We're gonna head out for a bit.

40:08.595 --> 40:10.373
If you can just lock up
when you leave, please.

40:10.397 --> 40:11.397
Will do.

40:15.836 --> 40:16.971
Hey, Theo?

40:18.037 --> 40:19.073
Come on, Theo.

40:19.973 --> 40:20.973
No.

40:22.709 --> 40:23.543
Come on.

40:23.577 --> 40:24.577
We'll go to the park.

40:30.484 --> 40:31.686
Leave me alone.

40:32.952 --> 40:34.021
It'll be fun.

40:38.658 --> 40:39.861
We'll get ice cream.

41:01.115 --> 41:03.785
We're going in the car again?

41:21.769 --> 41:22.971
What is that?

41:30.678 --> 41:31.980
What the fuck?

42:03.877 --> 42:04.877
Allison?

42:05.513 --> 42:07.048
Allison key?

42:07.080 --> 42:07.914
Kyra.

42:07.948 --> 42:09.083
Nurse Kyra.

42:09.115 --> 42:10.184
How you doing?

42:11.852 --> 42:13.721
I'm fine, thanks.

42:16.122 --> 42:18.492
Wow, Theo is really looking
good.

42:19.292 --> 42:20.595
He's really grown.

42:23.296 --> 42:25.899
Did you ever get in contact
with that person I recommended?

42:25.932 --> 42:28.935
I mean, it's just what
you've been through, it's...

42:28.968 --> 42:30.070
I'm fine.

42:30.104 --> 42:31.004
We're fine.

42:31.037 --> 42:32.037
Thank you.

42:33.173 --> 42:34.173
Theo?

42:35.109 --> 42:37.645
Allison, it wasn't your fault.

42:39.580 --> 42:41.782
Leave us alone.

42:41.814 --> 42:42.814
Theo.

42:45.019 --> 42:46.254
Let's go home, buddy.

43:28.162 --> 43:31.232
I still don't know why we had
to leave.

43:31.265 --> 43:33.234
We discussed this in the car.

43:33.267 --> 43:36.136
It's because you wanted to
leave.

43:36.169 --> 43:38.939
You only think about yourself.

43:38.972 --> 43:39.973
Don't point.

43:40.874 --> 43:42.109
And that is not true.

43:42.877 --> 43:45.113
Then tell me who the woman was.

43:46.981 --> 43:48.049
It was a long time ago.

43:48.082 --> 43:49.050
It doesn't matter.

43:49.082 --> 43:50.251
Who is she?

44:18.912 --> 44:19.912
Jack?

44:22.783 --> 44:24.251
Hello?

44:24.283 --> 44:25.283
Jack.

44:48.408 --> 44:49.611
You can do this.

45:00.453 --> 45:01.923
You can do this.

45:12.800 --> 45:14.801
Jack?

45:15.068 --> 45:16.403
Hello?

45:16.669 --> 45:17.738
Jack.

45:39.292 --> 45:40.292
Hi, Eleanor.

45:42.229 --> 45:43.931
I didn't know if you'd pick up.

45:44.932 --> 45:46.332
Wasn't sure I could.

45:46.365 --> 45:47.365
How's Theo?

45:49.903 --> 45:50.903
He's fine.

45:54.040 --> 45:55.309
Where are you?

45:55.341 --> 45:56.977
You know I can't tell you that.

45:57.010 --> 45:58.778
Allison, you need to come back.

45:58.812 --> 46:01.115
You need to bring Theo back.

46:02.149 --> 46:03.417
We're not coming back.

46:03.450 --> 46:05.419
Allison, I have rights.

46:05.452 --> 46:06.730
I don't care what the court
said.

46:06.754 --> 46:07.754
He's my son.

46:08.254 --> 46:10.791
I just wanna see my grandson.

46:13.060 --> 46:13.894
This was a mistake.

46:13.926 --> 46:14.761
I'm sorry.

46:14.794 --> 46:15.794
Allison, wait.

47:03.910 --> 47:05.512
It wasn't my fault.

49:41.568 --> 49:42.403
Pull over.

49:42.435 --> 49:44.138
I feel sick.

49:44.171 --> 49:45.171
Pull over.

49:49.309 --> 49:50.109
I feel sick.

49:50.142 --> 49:51.142
Pull over.

50:03.022 --> 50:04.691
And you're the embarrassing one

50:04.725 --> 50:06.527
taking me away from my friends.

50:06.560 --> 50:09.430
Allison, your drunk
coworkers aren't your friends.

50:09.463 --> 50:11.464
Least I have friends.

50:11.497 --> 50:12.432
You're a mean drunk.

50:12.466 --> 50:13.334
And keep it down.

50:13.367 --> 50:14.367
Theo's asleep.

50:15.135 --> 50:18.404
You just never wanna talk
about anything important.

50:18.437 --> 50:19.506
Important?

50:19.539 --> 50:21.675
Allison, I'm sick of having
the same conversation

50:21.707 --> 50:22.776
with you over and over.

50:22.809 --> 50:25.546
Oh, and by the way, you
wanna talk about important?

50:25.578 --> 50:26.723
You wanna talk about important?

50:26.747 --> 50:27.815
Your boss called today.

50:27.847 --> 50:30.183
You wanna guess what
important thing he had to say?

50:30.216 --> 50:32.051
They're gonna fire you.

50:32.084 --> 50:33.686
The school called today also.

50:33.720 --> 50:35.689
You forgot to pick Theo up.

50:35.722 --> 50:37.433
And let's talk about
another important thing.

50:37.457 --> 50:40.194
You need to go to rehab again.

50:40.227 --> 50:41.227
Fuck you.

50:45.664 --> 50:48.067
Is this the mother you wanted
to be?

50:56.309 --> 50:57.309
No.

50:58.278 --> 50:59.646
Daddy?

50:59.678 --> 51:01.214
I don't wanna
have this fight again.

51:01.247 --> 51:02.548
Theo, keep it down, Theo.

51:02.582 --> 51:04.718
The school called.

51:04.751 --> 51:08.089
Mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy!

51:13.060 --> 51:14.328
Mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy!

51:17.531 --> 51:19.734
Mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy!

51:54.834 --> 51:56.202
Nine, nine.

51:56.236 --> 51:57.571
No.

51:57.604 --> 51:58.604
911.

52:01.240 --> 52:02.408
This is 911.

52:02.441 --> 52:04.177
What's your emergency?

52:04.211 --> 52:06.280
There is a monster in the room,

52:06.312 --> 52:08.414
and I don't know where my mom
is.

52:08.448 --> 52:09.550
What's the address?

52:09.582 --> 52:10.416
I don't know.

52:10.450 --> 52:11.819
It's a scary green house.

52:11.852 --> 52:13.487
If you don't know the address,

52:13.519 --> 52:15.222
I'm tracking the GPS.

52:15.254 --> 52:16.088
I'm scared.

52:16.122 --> 52:17.758
Find a safe place to hide

52:17.790 --> 52:19.392
until the police arrive.

52:19.426 --> 52:20.594
Got it.

52:20.627 --> 52:22.263
Stay on the line.

52:41.814 --> 52:43.249
Go away.

52:47.821 --> 52:48.655
Go away.

52:48.687 --> 52:49.856
I'm tired.

52:52.158 --> 52:53.158
Police.

53:13.914 --> 53:17.551
Ma'am, we've received a 911
call from this residence

53:17.584 --> 53:19.752
indicating that someone
might be in trouble.

53:20.553 --> 53:22.455
Ma'am, are you the
only one in the house?

53:22.488 --> 53:23.488
Yes.

53:24.457 --> 53:25.626
No.

53:25.658 --> 53:26.859
My son is here.

53:26.892 --> 53:27.892
Where is he?

53:30.229 --> 53:31.231
Upstairs.

53:32.066 --> 53:33.834
Ma'am, the call we received
indicated

53:33.867 --> 53:36.702
that there may be an
intruder in the house.

53:36.736 --> 53:39.339
I haven't heard anyone.

53:40.173 --> 53:43.509
Ma'am, we received a call
from a scared little boy.

53:43.542 --> 53:46.180
I'm gonna have to ask you some
questions.

53:46.213 --> 53:47.680
Okay.

53:47.714 --> 53:49.550
Do you mind if I look around?

53:49.582 --> 53:50.651
Come on in.

55:08.894 --> 55:10.530
Wait there.

55:10.562 --> 55:11.798
I'm gonna go check it out.

55:39.725 --> 55:40.827
Hi, sweetie.

55:40.859 --> 55:42.328
I'm officer stryker.

55:43.330 --> 55:44.330
Are you okay?

55:45.464 --> 55:46.464
Are you okay?

55:50.470 --> 55:51.470
Hey.

55:54.807 --> 55:55.641
Oh, good.

55:55.675 --> 55:57.343
Oh, you scared me.

55:57.377 --> 55:58.377
What's your name?

56:00.379 --> 56:01.548
Theo.

56:01.580 --> 56:04.318
Theo, that's a cool name.

56:04.350 --> 56:06.053
Theo, who's this?

56:06.086 --> 56:06.986
Bunny.

56:07.021 --> 56:11.357
Bunny, nice to meet you, bunny
and Theo.

56:11.390 --> 56:12.459
Are you okay?

56:13.626 --> 56:15.461
You promise?

56:15.495 --> 56:16.930
Are you really okay?

56:20.499 --> 56:21.901
Is somebody hurting you?

56:21.935 --> 56:24.905
The monster.

56:24.937 --> 56:26.073
The monster?

56:27.874 --> 56:29.042
Where's the monster?

56:30.042 --> 56:31.044
In this house.

56:32.845 --> 56:34.881
What does the monster look
like, Theo?

56:36.982 --> 56:37.982
A spider.

56:39.452 --> 56:40.285
Like a spider?

56:40.319 --> 56:42.588
Theo, can you look at me for a
second?

56:43.957 --> 56:45.459
Like this, like a spider?

56:47.993 --> 56:50.631
Can you describe what
the spider looks like?

56:51.798 --> 56:52.832
Bigger.

56:52.865 --> 56:53.865
Bigger?

56:55.968 --> 56:59.438
Theo, I've been where you are.

56:59.472 --> 57:04.477
When I was your age, everything
was so big and scary.

57:04.778 --> 57:07.680
But guess what, I grew up, I got
bigger,

57:07.714 --> 57:10.551
and I got stronger, and
I know you will too.

57:13.452 --> 57:18.057
If you ever get scared
and you need anything,

57:18.091 --> 57:20.661
you call me and I'll be right
there.

57:22.995 --> 57:26.832
Okay, I'm gonna go talk
to your mom in private.

57:26.865 --> 57:28.768
I'm gonna be right around the
corner.

57:30.669 --> 57:32.405
Are you okay here?

57:34.441 --> 57:35.441
Look at me, Theo.

57:36.075 --> 57:37.444
You gonna be okay here?

57:37.477 --> 57:38.477
Promise?

57:39.111 --> 57:40.414
Okay.

57:40.446 --> 57:42.415
You are such a brave boy.

57:43.482 --> 57:44.618
You and bunny.

57:46.519 --> 57:47.519
So brave.

57:51.624 --> 57:52.492
Bye, Theo.

57:52.524 --> 57:53.793
Bye, bunny.

57:53.827 --> 57:55.995
I'll be right around the
corner if you need me.

59:20.879 --> 59:22.615
Estes, I found the kid.

59:22.649 --> 59:24.284
He's safe downstairs.

59:24.316 --> 59:25.751
I'll be damned.

59:45.537 --> 59:48.274
Ma'am, how much have
you had to drink tonight?

59:48.307 --> 59:49.909
I've had a couple drinks.

59:50.877 --> 59:52.246
In my own house.

59:53.845 --> 59:55.815
It seems like you've had quite
a few.

1:00:02.254 --> 1:00:04.790
Everything's fine upstairs.

1:00:08.928 --> 1:00:09.729
I think I might've figured out

1:00:09.761 --> 1:00:12.097
who the possible intruder might
be.

1:00:12.131 --> 1:00:13.098
When I was looking around,

1:00:13.131 --> 1:00:16.068
I saw the trashcan had
been rummaged through.

1:00:16.102 --> 1:00:19.105
A raccoon may have possibly
come in through the window

1:00:19.138 --> 1:00:21.141
and was looking around for food.

1:00:24.243 --> 1:00:26.346
Sounds like a false alarm.

1:00:26.379 --> 1:00:27.379
Yes, it does.

1:00:29.247 --> 1:00:31.216
Ma'am, I suggest you
be a little more careful

1:00:31.249 --> 1:00:32.985
around those open windows.

1:00:33.019 --> 1:00:33.852
Thank you, sir.

1:00:33.885 --> 1:00:34.953
I will.

1:00:34.986 --> 1:00:37.624
Ma'am, I suggest you don't
consume so much alcohol

1:00:37.656 --> 1:00:39.292
when you have a minor around.

1:00:39.325 --> 1:00:42.162
Thank you, ma'am, I
will take that to heart.

1:00:48.935 --> 1:00:50.737
Ma'am, here's our information

1:00:50.769 --> 1:00:52.705
if you have any further
questions.

1:00:52.738 --> 1:00:54.340
Thank you, officer.

1:02:16.055 --> 1:02:16.923
Hi, George.

1:02:16.955 --> 1:02:18.791
It's Allison key.

1:02:18.825 --> 1:02:20.169
I've been trying to get a hold
of Jack.

1:02:20.193 --> 1:02:25.198
He came by yesterday and
started fixing some things

1:02:26.064 --> 1:02:29.702
and left his toolbox
here, and I was hoping

1:02:29.736 --> 1:02:32.372
he could finish spraying for
bugs.

1:02:32.405 --> 1:02:34.441
So, if you could give me a call

1:02:34.473 --> 1:02:37.776
when you get a hold of
him, I'd be super grateful.

1:02:37.810 --> 1:02:38.810
Thank you.

1:02:39.946 --> 1:02:41.348
Hope you're having a good day.

1:03:45.111 --> 1:03:46.379
Theo, are you okay?

1:03:51.950 --> 1:03:53.452
Why is the door locked?

1:03:53.486 --> 1:03:55.522
I'm just reading comic books.

1:03:57.189 --> 1:04:00.092
Okay, well, I'm gonna
go fix some things.

1:04:00.126 --> 1:04:03.162
Okay, I'm gonna get
back to my comic book.

1:04:03.196 --> 1:04:05.098
Speed tick's in danger.

1:04:06.164 --> 1:04:08.033
Well, I'm sure he'll think his
way

1:04:08.066 --> 1:04:10.435
out of whatever trouble
he's gotten himself into.

1:04:10.468 --> 1:04:12.204
I think he will.

1:04:12.238 --> 1:04:14.441
I think he has a plan for the
bad guy.

1:04:17.510 --> 1:04:20.513
Hey, sport, you know I love
you more than anything, right?

1:04:21.981 --> 1:04:22.981
I know.

1:05:26.312 --> 1:05:27.914
This is the end of you now.

1:05:49.702 --> 1:05:53.339
I know they put a flashlight
in here.

1:05:59.711 --> 1:06:01.947
Don't you judge me.

1:06:34.714 --> 1:06:36.683
Jack, is that you?

1:06:47.459 --> 1:06:48.994
Holy smokes.

1:06:49.028 --> 1:06:50.163
What is all this stuff?

1:06:51.629 --> 1:06:53.499
It kind of looks like a lab.

1:07:15.086 --> 1:07:16.086
Ugh.

1:07:17.522 --> 1:07:20.225
Men never clean up after
themselves.

1:07:34.339 --> 1:07:35.339
Ugh.

1:07:45.151 --> 1:07:49.355
That cheap bastard has watered
it down.

1:08:12.077 --> 1:08:13.479
Theo, is that you?

1:08:44.642 --> 1:08:46.111
Fucking raccoon.

1:09:17.543 --> 1:09:19.212
George.

1:09:19.244 --> 1:09:21.080
This is the second time I've
called.

1:09:21.948 --> 1:09:24.316
I haven't heard from you or from
Jack.

1:09:27.520 --> 1:09:30.388
You can't water down bug spray

1:09:30.422 --> 1:09:33.392
and expect it to work,
you cheap ass bastard.

1:09:34.360 --> 1:09:36.729
You thought I wouldn't notice.

1:09:36.762 --> 1:09:38.598
I am very aware.

1:09:41.499 --> 1:09:44.337
I need you to send Jack here
today.

1:09:45.671 --> 1:09:46.671
Thank you.

1:10:05.658 --> 1:10:08.328
So, who are you, Mr. Scientist?

1:10:11.497 --> 1:10:13.199
Lizzie's getting worse.

1:10:13.231 --> 1:10:14.734
Her headaches are nonstop.

1:10:14.766 --> 1:10:16.568
My fear is that the cancer is
spreading

1:10:16.601 --> 1:10:18.805
more rapidly than originally
diagnosed.

1:10:21.774 --> 1:10:24.577
My last mixture did not
slow down the cancer,

1:10:24.610 --> 1:10:26.412
but I am positive I found the
cure.

1:10:27.079 --> 1:10:29.516
The scorpion venom was
not powerful enough.

1:10:30.182 --> 1:10:32.284
The scorpion needed to
be genetically crossbred

1:10:32.318 --> 1:10:36.189
with another creature's
venom to be more powerful.

1:10:36.221 --> 1:10:37.622
I've also added growth hormones

1:10:37.655 --> 1:10:40.392
to speed up the production of
the venom.

1:10:40.426 --> 1:10:43.930
My research into the DNA
of the chimera indicates

1:10:43.962 --> 1:10:46.631
that this unique cross
of a spider and scorpion

1:10:46.664 --> 1:10:48.600
should produce a proper type of
venom.

1:10:49.735 --> 1:10:51.371
I think I've finally succeeded.

1:10:52.137 --> 1:10:54.173
I'm confident this will cure
Lizzie.

1:10:55.807 --> 1:10:57.209
Daddy?

1:10:57.243 --> 1:10:58.444
Just one second, honey.

1:11:01.512 --> 1:11:02.781
I don't feel very well.

1:11:14.392 --> 1:11:15.962
It's gonna be okay.

1:11:15.994 --> 1:11:17.196
I've found the cure.

1:11:17.763 --> 1:11:18.864
No more shots, daddy.

1:11:20.031 --> 1:11:21.266
It's time.

1:11:21.300 --> 1:11:22.601
No.

1:11:22.635 --> 1:11:23.635
We're gonna fight.

1:11:25.937 --> 1:11:29.307
Lizzie?

1:11:29.341 --> 1:11:30.341
Lizzie.

1:11:30.943 --> 1:11:32.345
Lizzie, please, wake up.

1:11:33.412 --> 1:11:34.412
Lizzie.

1:11:36.448 --> 1:11:37.448
Please, no.

1:11:38.449 --> 1:11:39.449
Lizzie, wake up.

1:11:41.287 --> 1:11:42.821
Lizzie, come on.

1:11:42.855 --> 1:11:43.855
Come on, baby.

1:11:45.723 --> 1:11:46.993
Lizzie, come on.

1:11:50.495 --> 1:11:52.530
Come on, baby, come on.

1:11:52.564 --> 1:11:55.368
One, two, three, four, five,
six.

1:11:56.401 --> 1:11:59.471
One, two, three, four, five,
six.

1:11:59.504 --> 1:12:00.272
Come on, baby.

1:12:00.306 --> 1:12:01.641
One, two, three, four, five,
six.

1:12:03.441 --> 1:12:04.243
Come on.

1:12:04.275 --> 1:12:05.845
Come on, come on, come on, come
on.

1:12:16.622 --> 1:12:17.890
Come on, baby.

1:12:17.922 --> 1:12:18.922
Come on.

1:12:19.792 --> 1:12:20.626
Come on.

1:12:20.659 --> 1:12:21.627
Wake up.

1:12:21.659 --> 1:12:23.296
Lizzie, wake up.

1:12:23.329 --> 1:12:23.997
Come on, Lizzie.

1:12:24.029 --> 1:12:25.764
There we go.

1:12:25.797 --> 1:12:26.865
There we go.

1:12:26.899 --> 1:12:29.068
Lizzie, good job.

1:12:29.101 --> 1:12:30.101
Why?

1:12:35.841 --> 1:12:37.744
No, Lizzie, please.

1:12:39.645 --> 1:12:41.914
Wake up.

1:12:41.946 --> 1:12:42.847
Wake up.

1:12:42.881 --> 1:12:44.316
Wake up, please.

1:12:48.820 --> 1:12:50.589
Wake up, please, Lizzie.

1:12:51.623 --> 1:12:52.658
Come on.

1:12:52.690 --> 1:12:53.690
Wake up.

1:13:00.932 --> 1:13:04.337
No.

1:13:04.369 --> 1:13:05.503
No.

1:13:05.537 --> 1:13:06.739
No, no, no, no.

1:13:35.534 --> 1:13:36.936
We'll meet again little one.

1:13:36.968 --> 1:13:38.503
We'll meet again.

1:14:40.132 --> 1:14:42.935
Oh, what happened to this
little girl?

1:15:02.654 --> 1:15:03.654
Theo?

1:15:08.060 --> 1:15:09.060
Theo?

1:15:10.762 --> 1:15:11.762
Theo.

1:15:20.204 --> 1:15:25.211
Theo?

1:15:27.245 --> 1:15:28.079
Oh my god.

1:15:28.113 --> 1:15:29.748
What's happened?

1:15:34.552 --> 1:15:36.721
911, what's your emergency?

1:15:37.756 --> 1:15:39.258
My son is missing.

1:15:39.290 --> 1:15:41.593
How long has he been missing?

1:15:43.294 --> 1:15:44.195
I don't know.

1:15:44.230 --> 1:15:45.897
Ma'am, how old is your son?

1:15:45.931 --> 1:15:46.999
I'm sorry.

1:15:47.031 --> 1:15:48.834
What's your address?

1:15:49.767 --> 1:15:50.602
Hello?

1:15:50.636 --> 1:15:52.605
Ma'am, stay on the line.

1:16:27.873 --> 1:16:28.873
Theo!

1:16:44.589 --> 1:16:46.726
Police, we're coming in.

1:16:50.095 --> 1:16:53.798
Ma'am, we're responding to a 911
call.

1:16:53.832 --> 1:16:55.633
Do you understand?

1:16:55.667 --> 1:16:57.136
Yes, finally.

1:16:57.168 --> 1:16:59.037
Where's your son?

1:16:59.070 --> 1:16:59.904
I don't know.

1:16:59.937 --> 1:17:01.073
That's why I called you.

1:17:01.105 --> 1:17:03.275
When was the last time you saw
your son?

1:17:07.279 --> 1:17:08.948
I can't remember.

1:17:10.649 --> 1:17:13.185
Could he be at a friend's
house, a neighbor's house?

1:17:14.186 --> 1:17:15.087
We just moved here.

1:17:15.119 --> 1:17:17.055
No, we don't know anyone.

1:17:18.923 --> 1:17:20.592
Has anybody been to the house

1:17:20.626 --> 1:17:22.328
since the last time you saw your
son?

1:17:24.296 --> 1:17:25.097
No.

1:17:25.129 --> 1:17:27.031
The only people that know we're
here

1:17:27.065 --> 1:17:31.203
are the landlord and the
handyman.

1:17:31.235 --> 1:17:33.972
Could they have kidnapped my
son?

1:17:36.040 --> 1:17:37.610
I'll go up and take a look
around.

1:17:39.910 --> 1:17:42.948
Ma'am, how much have you
had to drink this time?

1:17:42.980 --> 1:17:44.349
It's none of your business.

1:17:44.382 --> 1:17:45.984
Oh, actually, it is my business.

1:17:46.017 --> 1:17:46.851
Fuck you.

1:17:46.885 --> 1:17:48.253
You are under arrest.

1:17:50.221 --> 1:17:52.857
Ms. Key, you have the
right to remain silent.

1:17:52.891 --> 1:17:55.794
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

1:17:55.827 --> 1:17:57.262
in a court of law.

1:17:57.294 --> 1:17:58.696
You have the right to an
attorney.

1:17:58.730 --> 1:18:00.366
If you cannot afford an
attorney,

1:18:00.399 --> 1:18:02.334
one will be appointed to you.

1:18:52.984 --> 1:18:54.787
Where are you, kid?

1:19:38.363 --> 1:19:39.865
I'm sorry.

1:19:39.897 --> 1:19:40.966
I'm sorry.

1:19:42.501 --> 1:19:44.704
I never meant for any of this to
happen.

1:19:46.137 --> 1:19:47.238
Alcoholics never do.

1:19:50.175 --> 1:19:52.910
Please find my son.

1:19:52.944 --> 1:19:54.814
He's all I have left.

1:19:56.213 --> 1:19:59.450
We will do everything in
our power to find your son.

1:19:59.484 --> 1:20:02.521
And, when we do, I will
do everything in my power

1:20:02.553 --> 1:20:03.922
to protect him from you.

1:20:06.792 --> 1:20:07.493
What if he's right?

1:20:07.525 --> 1:20:09.729
What if there's a monster?

1:20:14.031 --> 1:20:15.234
Look at yourself.

1:20:15.266 --> 1:20:16.968
The only monster here is you.

1:20:24.476 --> 1:20:26.378
You sit there and sober up.

1:20:47.565 --> 1:20:50.234
Estes, are you okay?

1:20:50.267 --> 1:20:51.102
Officer down.

1:20:51.136 --> 1:20:52.070
I repeat, officer down.

1:20:52.102 --> 1:20:53.271
Send backup immediately.

1:20:58.008 --> 1:21:00.212
Estes, who did this?

1:21:00.244 --> 1:21:03.915
Find the boy and get the fuck
out now.

1:21:03.949 --> 1:21:05.350
Estes, you stay with me.

1:21:05.382 --> 1:21:06.382
Estes.

1:21:07.218 --> 1:21:08.419
Estes, who did this?

1:21:08.453 --> 1:21:10.256
Stay with me, estes.

1:21:12.623 --> 1:21:13.623
Estes.

1:21:15.060 --> 1:21:16.195
I gotta get outta here.

1:21:16.227 --> 1:21:18.263
I gotta get you outta here.

1:21:19.597 --> 1:21:20.431
Help

1:21:20.466 --> 1:21:21.510
come on, I gotta get you outta
here.

1:21:21.534 --> 1:21:24.102
Not without my son.

1:21:35.379 --> 1:21:36.379
Theo?

1:21:44.455 --> 1:21:45.455
Oh my god, Jack.

1:22:07.311 --> 1:22:08.412
Theo?

1:22:08.445 --> 1:22:11.015
Help, I'm trapped.

1:22:11.048 --> 1:22:12.484
I'm stuck in the web.

1:22:13.618 --> 1:22:15.187
I'll get you out.

1:22:15.220 --> 1:22:16.288
Ow.

1:22:16.320 --> 1:22:17.320
You can't.

1:22:23.227 --> 1:22:24.562
Yes, we can.

1:22:24.596 --> 1:22:26.365
Remember the elephant?

1:22:26.397 --> 1:22:27.498
Yeah.

1:22:27.531 --> 1:22:28.576
The elephant didn't get free

1:22:28.600 --> 1:22:30.401
because it didn't think it
could.

1:22:30.435 --> 1:22:31.602
We will be free.

1:22:34.172 --> 1:22:35.207
Move slowly.

1:22:36.074 --> 1:22:38.010
It's part spider.

1:22:38.944 --> 1:22:41.379
It senses your movement.

1:22:41.413 --> 1:22:42.247
Sh.

1:22:42.279 --> 1:22:43.279
Hide.

1:22:45.083 --> 1:22:46.083
I'll protect you.

1:22:47.319 --> 1:22:49.354
I'll lure it away from you.

1:23:06.003 --> 1:23:06.837
I'm here.

1:23:06.872 --> 1:23:08.307
Come and get me, you son of a
bitch.

1:23:32.430 --> 1:23:33.430
Theo.

1:23:36.400 --> 1:23:37.435
Theo?

1:23:37.468 --> 1:23:39.604
Come on, come on.

1:23:39.637 --> 1:23:40.637
Come on.

1:23:49.614 --> 1:23:50.449
Bunny.

1:23:50.481 --> 1:23:51.315
Wait.

1:23:51.348 --> 1:23:52.217
Bunny.

1:23:52.249 --> 1:23:53.249
Bunny.

1:23:56.454 --> 1:23:59.157
It doesn't want to leave its
nest.

1:23:59.190 --> 1:24:00.190
Theo, get back.

1:24:21.046 --> 1:24:23.015
I told you I would protect you.

1:24:37.729 --> 1:24:42.735
Come on.

1:25:11.361 --> 1:25:12.230
Hey.

1:25:12.262 --> 1:25:13.330
How are you?

1:25:13.364 --> 1:25:14.364
Good, thanks.

1:25:15.199 --> 1:25:16.801
Congratulations on 180 days.

1:25:16.834 --> 1:25:17.502
Thank you.

1:25:17.535 --> 1:25:19.236
I would not be here without you.

1:25:19.270 --> 1:25:20.205
You know that.

1:25:20.238 --> 1:25:22.374
You did all the hard work.

1:25:22.406 --> 1:25:23.646
Well, without your persistence,

1:25:23.675 --> 1:25:25.677
I wouldn't have started it.

1:25:25.709 --> 1:25:26.711
I'm there for you.

1:25:26.744 --> 1:25:27.579
I know.

1:25:27.611 --> 1:25:28.611
How's Theo doing?

1:25:29.480 --> 1:25:30.515
All right, thanks.

1:25:30.548 --> 1:25:33.118
Two nightmares this week,
but just is what it is.

1:25:33.150 --> 1:25:34.228
Okay, well, he's a tough kid.

1:25:34.252 --> 1:25:37.789
- I'm sure he'll get past this.
- Yeah.

1:25:37.821 --> 1:25:40.092
It's just day by day, you know?

1:25:40.124 --> 1:25:41.359
- All of it.
- Yeah.

1:25:41.391 --> 1:25:42.726
We're all day-to-day.

1:25:42.760 --> 1:25:45.129
So, hey, let's get inside.

1:25:45.163 --> 1:25:46.064
I know you got a speech to give.

1:25:46.097 --> 1:25:49.734
180 days, that's something to be
proud of.

1:25:49.766 --> 1:25:50.734
Really, thank you.

1:25:50.767 --> 1:25:52.604
Oh, please don't thank me.

1:25:52.637 --> 1:25:53.472
It was all you.

1:25:53.504 --> 1:25:54.338
You did the hard work.

1:25:54.372 --> 1:25:55.372
Come on, let's go.

1:26:20.931 --> 1:26:22.399
I forgot the masks.

1:26:22.432 --> 1:26:23.100
Masks?

1:26:23.133 --> 1:26:25.302
We don't need no stinking masks.

1:26:25.336 --> 1:26:26.771
Besides, this stuff is organic.

1:26:28.239 --> 1:26:30.709
This is basically useless.

1:26:30.742 --> 1:26:33.311
Yeah, but we get to
charge three times more.

1:26:36.213 --> 1:26:37.848
This place reminds me of my
childhood.

1:26:37.882 --> 1:26:39.518
You make this stuff yourself?

1:26:39.551 --> 1:26:41.419
Some of it.

1:26:41.452 --> 1:26:42.830
You know, glad fire
got here when they did,

1:26:42.854 --> 1:26:44.756
otherwise this place would've
gone up.

1:26:46.223 --> 1:26:47.223
You ever smelled one?

1:26:47.626 --> 1:26:50.829
It'd be a lot easier to torch
this place than to clean it.

1:26:52.931 --> 1:26:54.232
What the fuck is that?

1:26:55.600 --> 1:26:56.735
Oh my god.

1:26:56.767 --> 1:26:57.601
- Oh.
- Oh no.

1:26:57.635 --> 1:26:58.302
It's just the doorway.

1:26:58.336 --> 1:26:59.870
I thought it was a jackalope.

1:26:59.904 --> 1:27:01.906
Smells like a jackalope down
here.

1:27:02.774 --> 1:27:04.209
I smelled a dead one.

1:27:04.242 --> 1:27:05.709
I have not smelled a live
jackalope.

1:27:05.743 --> 1:27:08.713
No, oddly enough, the live
one's worse than the dead one.

1:27:08.745 --> 1:27:09.480
They're worse?

1:27:09.513 --> 1:27:10.724
- They get better... go figure.

1:27:10.748 --> 1:27:11.817
- With death?
- Yeah.

1:27:13.284 --> 1:27:14.586
I'm sure I tasted a lot.

1:27:17.855 --> 1:27:19.424
I think that's all of them.

1:27:20.557 --> 1:27:23.294
Should I spray in the vents?

1:27:23.328 --> 1:27:24.428
Nah, I don't think so.

1:27:24.462 --> 1:27:26.798
That seems like a lot of work.

1:27:26.830 --> 1:27:28.967
I feel like we've wrapped this
up.

1:27:28.999 --> 1:27:30.569
Yeah.

1:27:30.601 --> 1:27:32.836
But are they gonna,
should we stay down here,

1:27:32.869 --> 1:27:34.573
or do we get paid by the hour?

1:27:36.240 --> 1:27:38.519
Well, we could take a long
time to take this backpack off.

1:27:38.543 --> 1:27:39.844
We should dump some of this out,

1:27:39.877 --> 1:27:41.513
looks like where we sprayed.

1:27:41.546 --> 1:27:42.847
Get something to eat?

1:27:42.879 --> 1:27:44.748
- I am very hungry.
- Garbage plates?

1:27:44.781 --> 1:27:47.886
Is there a jackalope
restaurant around here?

1:27:47.918 --> 1:27:49.587
Put that on the garbage plate.

1:27:50.654 --> 1:27:51.789
Race you to the Van.

1:27:51.823 --> 1:27:53.825
All right, I'll give you a
headstart.

1:27:55.627 --> 1:27:58.363
- Oh, fuck.
- Oh, mother of...

1:28:00.498 --> 1:28:02.968
That must be one fucking spider.

1:28:03.001 --> 1:28:05.669
What is it, it's like a ride
share here?

1:28:05.703 --> 1:28:06.538
It's huge.

1:28:06.570 --> 1:28:07.805
Looks like a bounce house.

1:28:09.373 --> 1:28:11.508
You know what, this is so effed
up.

1:28:11.542 --> 1:28:14.846
We're here to kill bugs,
not to clean up after them.

1:28:15.913 --> 1:28:16.913
I'm out.

1:28:45.909 --> 1:28:47.511
Where are you?

1:28:48.445 --> 1:28:49.513
Hm?

1:28:52.016 --> 1:28:53.518
Where are you?

1:28:58.556 --> 1:29:01.593
I see the baby.

1:29:01.626 --> 1:29:03.895
Oh, look at that little baby.

1:29:04.762 --> 1:29:05.762
Come on.

1:29:06.631 --> 1:29:07.731
Come on.

1:29:07.765 --> 1:29:08.999
Look at your treat.

1:29:09.033 --> 1:29:10.033
Come on.

1:29:11.703 --> 1:29:14.973
Oh, look at that good baby.

1:29:15.006 --> 1:29:16.006
Come on.

1:29:16.908 --> 1:29:19.477
That's a good boy.

1:29:19.510 --> 1:29:20.544
Yes.

1:29:21.546 --> 1:29:23.080
Look at that.

1:29:23.114 --> 1:29:23.948
I know.

1:29:23.981 --> 1:29:27.551
Those mean old people, they hurt
mommy.

1:29:27.584 --> 1:29:28.986
But you know what?

1:29:29.020 --> 1:29:30.754
Daddy's here.

1:29:30.788 --> 1:29:34.059
And no one is ever gonna hurt
you again.

1:29:34.092 --> 1:29:36.461
That's a good baby.

1:29:36.494 --> 1:29:37.494
Come on.

1:29:38.061 --> 1:29:40.765
Let's go some place safe.

1:29:40.797 --> 1:29:45.803
Some place where you can
grow and grow and grow.
