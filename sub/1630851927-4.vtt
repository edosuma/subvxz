- What are you building now?

15:02.931 --> 15:05.724
- Every resource of Montana

15:05.724 --> 15:08.137
can be grown
somewhere else for less.

15:08.137 --> 15:14.000
The fantasy of the West is
its only resource of any value.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.241
Colorado embraced
that decades ago.

15:17.241 --> 15:19.793
It's time Montana
did the same.

15:19.793 --> 15:23.689
Build me Aspen,
build me Breckenridge.

15:23.689 --> 15:28.206
I want a destination town
in every valley.

15:28.206 --> 15:31.689
But I need an
insider to do that.

15:31.689 --> 15:34.137
This is a name-your-price
offer, Beth.

15:37.758 --> 15:39.344
- You have a
controlling interest

15:39.344 --> 15:42.655
of Schwartz and Meyer
now, right?

15:42.655 --> 15:44.689
That's my price.

15:44.689 --> 15:46.586
- You want a piece
of Schwartz and Meyer?

15:46.586 --> 15:48.000
- I want your piece.

15:49.413 --> 15:50.793
You give me that, I'm yours.

15:50.793 --> 15:52.551
- You're going to fire him.

15:52.551 --> 15:54.586
- I'm going
to bankrupt him first.

15:54.586 --> 15:56.793
I want his fucking
grandchildren on welfare.

15:56.793 --> 15:58.551
You break your word to me,

16:00.137 --> 16:01.413
lady, I'll do the same to you.

16:08.827 --> 16:10.827
You have my number.

16:15.206 --> 16:17.482
- What do you think?

16:17.482 --> 16:20.172
- Oh, I think she's
a walking lawsuit.

16:20.172 --> 16:22.241
- I think she can make Montana

16:22.241 --> 16:24.379
the fastest growing state
in the nation.

16:25.827 --> 16:29.551
Behind every milestone of human
history stands a monster.

16:31.137 --> 16:33.620
And that's our monster.

16:35.241 --> 16:38.551
[music]

16:47.827 --> 16:50.689
- You are bullying this through
and we will not have it.
Jamie: Hm.

16:50.689 --> 16:52.724
- We will file suit
to halt construction

16:52.724 --> 16:55.620
until an environmental
impact study has been filed.

16:55.620 --> 16:57.655
- The Department of the Interior
is conducting the E.I.S.

16:57.655 --> 16:58.689
at the ski resort.

16:58.689 --> 17:00.586
- I'm talking about the airport.

17:00.586 --> 17:02.344
- Well, that build's
on private land.

17:02.344 --> 17:04.206
- It's a lease-back
to the State.

17:04.206 --> 17:06.655
- When construction is complete.

17:06.655 --> 17:08.275
- It's a bullshit loophole,
Jamie.

17:08.275 --> 17:12.448
And know this: the lawsuit
will name the State as well.

17:12.448 --> 17:14.310
- Oh.

17:14.310 --> 17:16.931
Well, the Market Equities
group has no obligation

17:16.931 --> 17:18.206
to publish a study.

17:18.206 --> 17:20.896
The government has
no authority to mandate it.

17:20.896 --> 17:23.689
State and Federal building codes
are being followed.

17:23.689 --> 17:27.620
But if your law firm would like
to dispute that, file suit.

17:27.620 --> 17:29.896
I will see you in court
where it will be

17:29.896 --> 17:31.068
dismissed with prejudice,

17:31.068 --> 17:33.137
at which point the state
will file countersuit

17:33.137 --> 17:34.965
for abuse of process.

17:34.965 --> 17:38.862
Now, the state of Montana
is the beneficiary

17:38.862 --> 17:41.793
of a privately funded
6 billion dollar

17:41.793 --> 17:43.965
infrastructure investment
that will yield

17:43.965 --> 17:47.310
thousands of jobs
and billions in revenue.

17:47.310 --> 17:49.896
We will stand firm
with the M.E. group

17:49.896 --> 17:52.034
and their investment
in our state

17:52.034 --> 17:54.793
and I will vigorously
defend their right to do it.

17:54.793 --> 17:57.310
Now, if any of you want
to challenge that,

17:57.310 --> 17:59.965
bring your best
and I'll bring mine.

18:02.241 --> 18:04.551
- [sighs]

18:04.551 --> 18:06.965
This a land grab, Jamie.
And you know it.

18:06.965 --> 18:09.379
- No one's being forced
to sell their land, Ruth.

18:09.379 --> 18:11.241
These are private
transactions on land

18:11.241 --> 18:12.758
in which your client
has no sway.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.448
Not that your client cares
about the little things

18:14.448 --> 18:16.551
like legal precedent
and case law.

18:16.551 --> 18:18.896
- My client cares about Montana.

18:18.896 --> 18:21.000
About the rivers
this will pollute

18:21.000 --> 18:23.172
and the animals
this will displace.

18:23.172 --> 18:27.620
- 6,000 jobs.

18:27.620 --> 18:29.965
My recommendation is you take
this in front of a judge

18:29.965 --> 18:31.689
who does not want
to be re-elected.

18:31.689 --> 18:33.000
- Look...

18:33.000 --> 18:34.965
We're here to negotiate.

18:34.965 --> 18:38.103
- We have no interest
in negotiating.

18:38.103 --> 18:40.931
- So, the State's position
is essentially 'fuck off.'

18:43.241 --> 18:44.206
- Yeah.

18:55.344 --> 18:58.551
Would Defenders file
in District 6 or 22?

19:02.137 --> 19:03.482
Hold my calls.

19:20.448 --> 19:21.793
How are you, Kayce?

19:23.586 --> 19:24.793
- I've been better.

19:26.689 --> 19:27.689
You?

19:30.344 --> 19:33.482
- Just hiding in my work,
if you know what I mean.

19:34.482 --> 19:35.655
- Yeah, I do.

19:38.241 --> 19:39.310
- It's good to see you.

19:43.758 --> 19:45.241
- You didn't come around.

19:46.586 --> 19:49.000
You didn't call, nothing.
You just...

19:49.000 --> 19:50.448
Disappeared.

19:50.448 --> 19:55.241
- I have yet to stop
fighting for this family.

19:55.241 --> 19:57.793
I was the reason
there was police protection

19:57.793 --> 19:59.862
for him at that hospital
for two months.

20:02.310 --> 20:05.482
I was the reason that
there was no investigation

20:05.482 --> 20:07.862
into the murders at the ranch--

20:07.862 --> 20:09.241
- That was self defense.

20:10.620 --> 20:14.275
- One assailant
executed in the kitchen,

20:14.275 --> 20:16.310
one shot in the back
near the barn,

20:16.310 --> 20:19.448
another hung from
the corral gate.

20:19.448 --> 20:23.931
And you, without any
authority whatsoever to do so,

20:23.931 --> 20:26.965
ram a vehicle,
kill everyone inside

20:26.965 --> 20:28.241
with an assault rifle
in the middle

20:28.241 --> 20:29.965
of a fucking intersection.

20:29.965 --> 20:32.000
- Those were the men
that attacked our father.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.379
- It doesn't matter.

20:33.379 --> 20:37.000
There's is what's just
and there's the law.

20:38.517 --> 20:40.758
They are not the same thing.

20:40.758 --> 20:43.413
And I am the reason
no one is sitting in prison,

20:43.413 --> 20:46.241
learning that hard lesson
right now.

20:46.241 --> 20:47.655
- You didn't visit him.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.241
You didn't call him.
Not one of us.

20:52.241 --> 20:55.241
- I couldn't visit.
I couldn't call.

20:55.241 --> 20:56.896
That would labeled collusion

20:56.896 --> 20:58.344
and everything I swept
under the rug would be

20:58.344 --> 21:00.724
out in the fucking floor
for the whole world to see.

21:00.724 --> 21:02.379
Besides, Beth
is always by his side.

21:02.379 --> 21:05.103
and the only space
I will share with that bitch

21:05.103 --> 21:06.931
is a court room
or her fucking death bed.

21:10.689 --> 21:12.103
He hates me because of her.

21:14.103 --> 21:15.482
- He doesn't hate you, Jamie.

21:18.068 --> 21:19.344
He's why I'm here.

21:25.931 --> 21:27.724
This is the man who
took a hit out on us.

21:32.620 --> 21:36.172
[music]

21:45.758 --> 21:49.448
- This man has been
in prison for twenty years.

21:49.448 --> 21:50.586
What makes you think it's him?

21:51.793 --> 21:54.862
- Dad says it's
from a reliable source.

21:57.517 --> 21:59.068
- Care to share the source?

21:59.068 --> 22:01.172
- He didn't say.

22:01.172 --> 22:02.517
- Figures.

22:06.551 --> 22:07.896
What does he want from me?

22:09.965 --> 22:11.482
- Just take a look
at his prison file,

22:11.482 --> 22:13.689
see if you can make
a connection.

22:15.448 --> 22:16.896
Maybe let me interview him,
or...

22:16.896 --> 22:18.344
- Hmm.
[chuckles]

22:19.137 --> 22:20.689
Mm-mm.

22:20.689 --> 22:22.275
This must be by the book, Kayce.

22:22.275 --> 22:24.448
These guys know
the law as well as I do.

22:24.448 --> 22:25.896
His attorney will be present.

22:25.896 --> 22:27.482
The interview will
be recorded.

22:27.482 --> 22:31.724
It's got to be a detective from
homicide and a State's Attorney.

22:31.724 --> 22:33.241
- He doesn't want
some State's Attorney.

22:36.275 --> 22:37.344
He wants you, Jamie.

22:38.620 --> 22:41.379
[music]

22:47.103 --> 22:48.517
- He wants me to do it?

22:48.517 --> 22:50.551
- Yeah.

22:50.551 --> 22:52.413
Only people you
can trust is family.

22:58.068 --> 22:59.241
Will you do it?

23:06.172 --> 23:07.379
- Of course I'll do it.

23:11.517 --> 23:14.448
[music]

23:14.448 --> 23:15.689
- Thank you.

23:26.724 --> 23:27.827
I love you, brother.

23:31.379 --> 23:32.379
- I love you.

23:44.413 --> 23:50.827
[cattle lowing]

23:50.827 --> 23:53.517
- Hey, hey!
- Buck, buck, buck!

23:53.517 --> 23:56.068
- Hup, hup!

23:56.068 --> 23:58.103
Hey! This 'un too.

23:58.103 --> 24:01.310
- Hell, the whole damn
herd has pink eye.

24:01.310 --> 24:03.827
Let's push 'em into the arena,
we'll run 'em through the chute.

24:03.827 --> 24:06.034
- You don't want these sick
sum'bitches in the arena.

24:06.034 --> 24:08.103
Why don't we just
doctor 'em right here?

24:08.103 --> 24:11.241
- Well, I fucking said so.

24:11.241 --> 24:13.517
- I didn't know you was boss
when boss is gone.

24:13.517 --> 24:16.206
- Hey, I'm always the boss
when the boss is gone.

24:16.206 --> 24:18.517
- Look, he's right,
we should doctor 'em right here.

24:18.517 --> 24:20.586
- Push them in
the fucking arena!

24:20.586 --> 24:22.620
We start dragging 'em
in the pasture

24:22.620 --> 24:24.206
they'll scatter
to hell and gone.

24:31.448 --> 24:32.965
- You saddle those horses?

24:32.965 --> 24:34.103
- They're tied outside.

24:34.103 --> 24:35.689
- You and I are talking later.

24:36.827 --> 24:38.551
- Am I in trouble?

24:39.551 --> 24:40.931
- Is he in trouble?

24:40.931 --> 24:42.482
- He pissed your
daughter off pretty good.

24:47.448 --> 24:48.758
- Then he's in trouble.

24:50.034 --> 24:52.000
[cattle lowing]

24:57.482 --> 24:59.344
Thought we were doctoring today.

24:59.344 --> 25:00.931
- So did I.

25:07.724 --> 25:09.655
Lloyd! Get over here.

25:13.034 --> 25:14.758
What in the fuck
are you doing?

25:14.758 --> 25:16.413
- Running them
through the chute.

25:16.413 --> 25:18.758
- Well, a couple of those got
pink eye, I can see it
from here.

25:18.758 --> 25:21.310
- They all do. We got to doctor
the whole damn herd.

25:21.310 --> 25:22.758
- Well, don't
bring them in here.

25:22.758 --> 25:24.551
You'll give every animal
we got fucking pink eye.

25:24.551 --> 25:26.862
- It's faster and easier
in the chute.

25:26.862 --> 25:29.413
- Doctoring cattle ain't
a fucking timed event, Lloyd.

25:29.413 --> 25:31.931
And easy doesn't
factor in at all.

25:34.482 --> 25:35.896
- Lloyd, you listen to me.

25:35.896 --> 25:38.724
You move those fucking heifers
out, do your fucking job.

25:38.724 --> 25:40.206
Go!

25:40.206 --> 25:41.448
- Push 'em back out.

25:41.448 --> 25:43.724
- Let's go, move 'em out!
Push them back!

25:45.275 --> 25:48.827
- Push 'em back out.
That means you too, Walker.

25:48.827 --> 25:51.689
- Hell, you're the boss.
Hear that, boys?

25:51.689 --> 25:53.448
The boss is going to let us
play cowboy today.

25:53.448 --> 25:54.586
How about that shit?

25:55.655 --> 25:57.103
[music]

26:03.068 --> 26:04.655
- Ho! Ho, ho!

26:24.379 --> 26:25.586
- Let 'em go!

26:41.931 --> 26:43.137
- Lloyd.

26:49.379 --> 26:52.724
Not like you to take short cuts.
What's the matter with you?

26:52.724 --> 26:56.551
- Didn't mean it to be a
short cut, it just seems...

26:56.551 --> 26:58.862
Them girls,
they can't rope and--

26:58.862 --> 27:01.000
- Not looking for an answer.

27:02.551 --> 27:03.931
[clicks tongue]

27:07.379 --> 27:08.517
[clicks tongue]

27:15.965 --> 27:16.965
How was he?

27:18.034 --> 27:19.344
- I asked for the file,

27:19.344 --> 27:22.551
I asked for the interview
and he didn't blink.

27:23.655 --> 27:25.379
Just said yes.

27:25.379 --> 27:27.586
He's gonna notify
the inmate's attorney,

27:27.586 --> 27:29.827
and that homicide detective
at the Sheriff's office.

27:29.827 --> 27:31.068
Just the way
you're supposed to do it.

27:31.068 --> 27:34.000
- Good.
Good.

27:35.034 --> 27:36.379
- I, uh, thought about our talk.

27:38.724 --> 27:40.068
- Come up with an idea?

27:40.068 --> 27:41.655
- I think so.

27:43.172 --> 27:45.068
It's not gonna be easy
on either of us.

27:45.068 --> 27:46.241
But it feels right.

27:46.241 --> 27:49.758
- [chuckles]

27:49.758 --> 27:50.793
Then it probably is, son.

27:51.689 --> 27:53.413
[clicks tongue]

28:10.620 --> 28:12.103
- He's getting a little old
for that, ain't he?

28:15.103 --> 28:16.310
- [sigh]

28:20.137 --> 28:23.000
It's the only way he'll
let me do it.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.344
Some day soon
he won't let me do it at all,

28:26.344 --> 28:28.103
and another thing
we've shared is gone.

28:30.241 --> 28:31.620
- Can I talk to you
for a second?

28:47.965 --> 28:48.965
Did you mean it?

28:50.241 --> 28:51.275
- Mean what?

28:52.758 --> 28:55.000
- Do you hate me?

28:55.000 --> 28:57.310
- Kayce, I don't have the
strength to do this right now.

28:57.310 --> 28:58.379
- Find it.

29:00.137 --> 29:01.931
- If I hated you,
I would've left.

29:11.758 --> 29:13.896
- He's never gonna get better
staying here.

29:16.827 --> 29:18.344
And neither will you.

29:20.517 --> 29:23.896
I was thinking
we could go
