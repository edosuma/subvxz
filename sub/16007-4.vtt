WEBVTT

00:05.288 --> 00:09.053
Well, seeing as we're both not
working, why don't we get a drink?

00:09.078 --> 00:09.526
Really?

00:09.552 --> 00:12.082
Keisha, it's Richard.
Is everything alright?

00:12.107 --> 00:14.123
Now is a bad time.
It's always a bad time with you.

00:14.476 --> 00:16.504
You don't just need Ash's consent.

00:16.520 --> 00:18.579
You need the sperm donor's consent.

00:18.599 --> 00:21.247
The donor was anonymous.
His name's Tim Dolan.

00:21.272 --> 00:24.480
Well, we clearly
won't be settling this today.

00:24.500 --> 00:27.148
We still have Felix Murphy, yes?
MAN: Correct.

00:27.173 --> 00:30.209
He was knee-capped by the same gun
used in the Nobakht drive-by...

00:30.335 --> 00:31.512
...and Ash's murder.

00:31.532 --> 00:35.474
Mr Murphy, please describe to this
commission who shot you that day.

00:35.499 --> 00:36.508
I don't know who.

00:36.528 --> 00:39.234
I want to organise another
undercover operation

00:39.472 --> 00:41.500
but this time we'll use a woman.

00:41.520 --> 00:44.556
I looked up who else in Sydney
has a Ferrari 458.

00:45.472 --> 00:46.708
Major Simon Hamilton.

00:47.472 --> 00:48.825
And what about Uruzgan?

00:48.850 --> 00:51.496
That was the ambush in Afghanistan
in 2013.

00:51.516 --> 00:55.528
Casualties?
Ten wounded and two fatalities.

00:55.548 --> 00:58.901
Todd doesn't have any connection
to Simon Hamilton at all.

00:58.921 --> 01:00.980
It doesn't make sense.
Yes, it does.

01:01.005 --> 01:03.484
That's Holsworthy.
Karen Parker?

01:03.504 --> 01:06.446
WOMAN: If you know anything
that could be relevant,

01:06.471 --> 01:08.463
please contact the police.

01:49.484 --> 01:52.484
Lance Corporal Parker?
We're ready for you upstairs.

01:52.509 --> 01:54.433
Come through.

01:54.520 --> 01:56.560
Uh, it's a closed hearing today.

01:57.476 --> 01:59.488
All this and we can't come in?

01:59.504 --> 02:02.516
It's OK. Grab a coffee outside.

02:09.496 --> 02:10.551
(Sighs)

02:12.464 --> 02:15.112
MAN: Did you see Todd Wilson
on Australia Day?

02:15.468 --> 02:20.396
Yes. He picked me up from work and
he bought me a coffee in Glenfield.

02:20.688 --> 02:21.806
What time was that?

02:21.831 --> 02:25.756
It was after the parades,
so maybe 2:30, 3:00?

02:25.772 --> 02:28.736
We only spoke for about 20 minutes.

02:28.752 --> 02:30.752
And Todd gave you something, yeah?

02:32.603 --> 02:34.627
He gave me a watch.

02:34.684 --> 02:35.704
Anything else?

02:36.517 --> 02:38.521
Just a watch.

02:39.700 --> 02:42.995
Why don't you tell us what you were
really meeting about?

02:46.740 --> 02:49.696
Look, I never asked him to...

02:52.360 --> 02:54.368
Please, continue.

02:55.376 --> 02:57.350
He told me that
he'd paid for the watch

02:57.376 --> 02:59.392
using Major Hamilton's
credit card details.

02:59.412 --> 03:01.440
So you gave Todd
Major Hamilton's credit card

03:01.456 --> 03:03.392
so he could buy you a watch?

03:03.412 --> 03:06.384
No, no. I just said
he was a nightmare,

03:06.404 --> 03:08.993
and Todd said we should steal
his credit card

03:09.018 --> 03:10.054
and go on a spree to get even.

03:10.360 --> 03:11.772
I thought he was joking.

03:11.797 --> 03:15.388
100%. And then he shows up
with this $500 watch.

03:15.404 --> 03:17.384
I mean, I dunno...

03:17.400 --> 03:18.871
He fixed EFTPOS machines.

03:19.364 --> 03:20.448
Were you aware that Todd
and his wife, Elaheh,

03:21.227 --> 03:23.404
were saving to rebuild a nursery?
Yes.

03:23.420 --> 03:24.436
And you also knew

03:24.456 --> 03:27.400
that their insurance claim
had been rejected after the fire?

03:27.420 --> 03:30.891
The insurance company said
it was arson. Todd was shattered.

03:30.916 --> 03:31.964
You were working in concert with Todd

03:32.364 --> 03:33.448
to obtain Simon Hamilton's
personal details...

03:34.368 --> 03:36.839
No, no, that's not true.
..for mutual gain.

03:36.864 --> 03:39.570
He helped you, you helped him.
That's not true!

03:43.368 --> 03:45.400
Todd wanted to know if we were
having a boy or a girl.

03:45.420 --> 03:49.384
I wanted the surprise,
and he agreed to wait and see.

03:49.404 --> 03:52.384
When he died,
I decided to find out...

03:52.404 --> 03:55.440
So, why did you take part
in the public appeal,

03:56.360 --> 03:58.444
when you knew very well
where Todd was that afternoon?

03:59.364 --> 04:01.412
I only saw him for 20 minutes,
not three hours.

04:01.432 --> 04:03.428
Your extended family
were desperate for answers.

04:03.448 --> 04:06.400
Yeah, so am I!
I don't know what Todd was up to!

04:06.416 --> 04:09.372
I... I...

04:09.392 --> 04:12.408
I was also scared,
I thought Hamilton would find out

04:12.428 --> 04:15.396
and assume that I bought the watch,
and then...

04:15.412 --> 04:16.452
Look, I thought it was irrelevant.

04:17.372 --> 04:19.372
That Todd must have been
messed up in drugs, or...

04:19.392 --> 04:21.363
You'd love us to believe that,
wouldn't you?

04:21.384 --> 04:23.372
I'm sorry?
You wanted revenge.

04:23.388 --> 04:24.977
You knew Todd needed money,

04:25.002 --> 04:27.010
so after finding out your boss
had a new Ferrari,

04:27.372 --> 04:28.436
you decided to help Todd steal it.

04:28.456 --> 04:31.376
He was giving you your cut
when he came to see you,

04:31.396 --> 04:34.412
only Major Hamilton found out and
got his own revenge later that night

04:34.432 --> 04:37.138
and that's the reason
you haven't come forward.

04:38.036 --> 04:40.860
You feel responsible
for Todd's death, don't you?

04:40.885 --> 04:43.121
Major Hamilton
doesn't drive a Ferrari.

04:48.393 --> 04:51.313
Can you describe the document
I've just given you?

04:52.397 --> 04:55.377
Registration papers...

04:55.397 --> 04:59.333
...for a Ferrari 458
in Simon Hamilton's name.

04:59.353 --> 05:02.341
If he does have one, and I don't
even see how he could afford it,

05:02.361 --> 05:05.313
I didn't help Todd steal it...
When are you gonna stop lying?

05:05.333 --> 05:07.325
I'm not lying!
Ever since you've walked in here

05:07.345 --> 05:10.369
it's been lie after lie after lie!
The watch was... I'm not...

05:10.389 --> 05:12.365
Corporal Parker,
contempt of this commission

05:12.385 --> 05:16.389
carries serious consequences and
may result in a custodial sentence.

05:16.982 --> 05:18.958
You understand?

05:20.010 --> 05:22.038
Yes.

05:22.054 --> 05:24.038
This hearing's adjourned.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.075
(Exhales)

05:34.027 --> 05:36.015
This is how you get your kicks?!

05:36.031 --> 05:37.502
She doesn't deserve this!

05:37.527 --> 05:40.519
Don't you have a family?

05:46.047 --> 05:48.059
Walk away.

05:52.019 --> 05:55.019
Do you think they know
about Karen's deal with Todd?

05:55.039 --> 05:58.083
Suzy and Amile might,
but Elaheh, she's...

05:59.003 --> 06:01.999
...she's always seemed genuinely
shocked by the murder of her husband,

06:02.015 --> 06:03.059
why someone would want to kill him.

06:03.079 --> 06:05.063
Unless she's a great actress.
Like Karen.

06:05.083 --> 06:08.319
I still don't see how Simon
could even afford a Ferrari.

06:08.344 --> 06:11.756
Well, a novated lease on a $400,000
car with a 40% residual

06:12.007 --> 06:13.071
would leave you with
monthly repayments

06:13.091 --> 06:16.055
of, maybe, $5,000 or $6,000,so if he's paid off his house

06:16.075 --> 06:19.003
and he doesn't have any dependents,
it might be possible.

06:19.023 --> 06:20.999
Really? What do you think
a Major gets paid?

06:21.015 --> 06:22.047
OK, you might be right.

06:22.063 --> 06:24.003
He must deal drugs on the side.

06:24.023 --> 06:27.015
The default explanation for
spare cash anywhere in the world.

06:27.035 --> 06:30.011
Lina, can you have a search warrant
issued for Karen Parker's home?

06:30.031 --> 06:31.091
Sure. We need to check
the export records

06:32.007 --> 06:33.890
for both Simon and Todd's names.

06:33.915 --> 06:34.911
Richard?
Sure.

06:34.999 --> 06:37.047
$100 says it was shipped to
the Middle East. Or Eastern Europe.

06:37.067 --> 06:39.071
I don't get why Karen
even told us about the watch.

06:39.091 --> 06:41.071
Why not say they just met up
and talked footy?

06:41.091 --> 06:43.999
Well, she wants us to think
she's telling the truth.

06:44.015 --> 06:45.047
You definitely think she's lying?

06:45.067 --> 06:47.047
About stealing Hamilton's car
with Todd? Yeah.

06:47.067 --> 06:50.003
Although he hasn't even reported
the car as stolen.

06:50.019 --> 06:51.043
If he bought it with drug money

06:51.063 --> 06:53.063
and shot Todd in revenge,
he probably wouldn't.

06:53.083 --> 06:55.260
And he's thinking
he got away with it.

06:55.285 --> 06:57.325
We've called all sorts of people
and haven't gone near him.

06:57.351 --> 07:00.019
We should move while we've got
the element of surprise.

07:00.039 --> 07:03.023
LINA: What are we expecting to find?
The gun that shot Todd

07:03.043 --> 07:05.055
and whatever illegal activity
paid for the Ferrari.

07:05.071 --> 07:07.043
(Scoffs) No, no, hang on.

07:07.063 --> 07:10.534
Even a royal commission needs
evidence of criminal activity.

07:10.559 --> 07:13.618
We can't get a search warrant
just hoping to find it.

07:21.011 --> 07:22.423
Let's talk to him first.

07:27.035 --> 07:29.047
Mr Hamilton.
Major Hamilton.

07:33.015 --> 07:36.003
A summons to appear at
the King Royal Commission.

07:40.008 --> 07:41.067
What's this about?

07:41.087 --> 07:43.323
No obligation to tell you,
Mr Hamilton.

07:47.999 --> 07:49.647
OK, let's begin on the 26th.

07:49.672 --> 07:52.496
Were you across
Lance Corporal Parker's movements

07:52.521 --> 07:53.874
on the 26th of January?

07:54.003 --> 07:55.533
Lance Corporal Parker?
Yes.

07:55.999 --> 07:58.031
Karen Parker?
Correct.

07:59.051 --> 08:04.019
I saw her for morning PT and then
later for the Australia Day parade.

08:04.039 --> 08:06.031
Did you notice her
leaving the base after that?

08:06.051 --> 08:09.640
I didn't see her leave but I assume
she went home after lunch.

08:09.665 --> 08:11.195
I wouldn't be very popular

08:11.497 --> 08:13.545
if I didn't let my men knock off
early on a public holiday.

08:13.561 --> 08:17.023
And are you? Very popular?

08:17.039 --> 08:19.075
Respected, yes.

08:19.091 --> 08:22.003
No-one's liked by everyone.

08:22.019 --> 08:23.071
No.

08:23.087 --> 08:25.205
What's your opinion of Karen Parker?

08:25.225 --> 08:28.225
She's a good soldier.
Tough, intuitive in the field.

08:28.250 --> 08:31.003
Don't have to ask anything of her.

08:31.023 --> 08:34.494
Mentally, I suspect she's edged
closer to burnout than most.

08:35.087 --> 08:37.616
Do you have your credit card
with you today?

08:38.003 --> 08:40.058
The one ending in 7493.

08:43.075 --> 08:45.019
Yes.

08:45.039 --> 08:48.157
Are you aware that Karen Parker
and a relative of hers

08:48.177 --> 08:51.001
made a recent purchase
using that card's details?

08:51.026 --> 08:53.868
No. What did they buy?

08:54.003 --> 08:56.035
We'll come back to that.
But how did they get my details?

08:56.055 --> 08:58.091
When did you first tell Karen
you were buying a Ferrari?

08:59.007 --> 09:00.055
A what?

09:00.075 --> 09:03.546
Your Ferrari 458. When did Karen
first know you'd bought it?

09:05.003 --> 09:06.051
I drive a Falcon.

09:06.071 --> 09:10.007
So you're denying that you bought
a Ferrari 458 on the 25th of January,

09:10.023 --> 09:12.011
even though we have RMS records

09:12.031 --> 09:16.090
that show that the purchase was made
under your name and your address.

09:17.087 --> 09:19.083
Yes.

09:20.003 --> 09:22.709
What time did you finish work
on Australia Day?

09:24.015 --> 09:26.015
Left around 3:30.

09:26.031 --> 09:28.023
After that, where were you?

09:28.039 --> 09:29.083
I don't recall.

09:29.385 --> 09:31.915
Were you at home?
Did you go out for dinner?

09:32.558 --> 09:34.015
I couldn't say.

09:34.031 --> 09:35.071
I just don't remember.

09:35.091 --> 09:38.059
You need to elaborate, Mr Hamilton.
I don't need to do anything.

09:38.079 --> 09:40.727
We're talking about last month,
not last year.

09:40.752 --> 09:42.047
I'm aware of that.

09:42.067 --> 09:45.043
There's no right to silence in
this commission. That's clear.

09:45.063 --> 09:47.027
We have powers
to ensure your cooperation.

09:47.047 --> 09:49.051
Was that a question?
Let's not waste any more time.

09:49.071 --> 09:52.248
Please answer the question
so we can move on from here.

09:53.003 --> 09:55.533
I'm afraid I'm having trouble
placing events

09:55.558 --> 09:57.558
in my long-term memory.

10:00.055 --> 10:02.075
Two things - get that
search warrant for his house,

10:02.995 --> 10:05.059
and can someone confirm
that he did buy this Ferrari?

10:05.075 --> 10:07.015
From Karen's flat.

10:07.031 --> 10:08.063
The watch.

10:08.083 --> 10:10.966
Unopened. Matches the amount
on Simon's statement.

10:10.999 --> 10:12.705
So she was telling the truth.

10:12.730 --> 10:14.714
About that part.

10:16.815 --> 10:18.051
It was lucky, really.

10:18.071 --> 10:21.015
We might only see one or two
second-hand 458s a year.

10:21.035 --> 10:23.212
Mr Hamilton had been
in a week earlier

10:23.232 --> 10:25.409
and said if I got one in,
he'd buy it.

10:25.434 --> 10:27.031
And I did, and he did.

10:27.051 --> 10:29.999
Less than 10,000 on the clock -
as good as new.

10:31.031 --> 10:33.027
Was he in uniform?
Sorry?

10:33.047 --> 10:35.577
Simon Hamilton -
was he in his army uniform?

10:35.999 --> 10:38.117
Army?
Well, he's a major in the army.

10:38.142 --> 10:41.999
No, no,
he's a foreign exchange trader.

10:42.019 --> 10:44.372
We rang his company
to verify his salary.

10:45.007 --> 10:47.772
I think you're mixing him up
with somebody else.

10:51.011 --> 10:52.083
Have you got any security cameras?

10:52.999 --> 10:54.047
We couldn't see a picture, could we?

10:54.067 --> 10:58.126
Unfortunately the cameras are only
on at night, when we need security.

10:59.079 --> 11:03.075
Ah, I could call head office
to get the paperwork.

11:03.995 --> 11:10.063
So, if I said 6'4", big, strong,
um... crew cut, 40-ish.

11:10.079 --> 11:13.055
No, no - think 5'10", late 20s.

11:13.071 --> 11:15.071
And he's about to be a dad.

11:15.091 --> 11:18.797
He joked about how terrible
the car would be for a baby capsule.

11:18.822 --> 11:20.027
Wait, wait.

11:20.047 --> 11:22.063
The finance company
would never have approved the loan

11:22.079 --> 11:24.015
if it didn't check out.

11:24.031 --> 11:25.067
Yes, that's him!

11:25.083 --> 11:28.015
Mr Hamilton.

11:33.091 --> 11:35.039
Todd bought the Ferrari?

11:35.059 --> 11:37.019
He didn't just steal
Simon's credit card.

11:37.039 --> 11:39.063
He stole his whole identity.
Pretty much.

11:39.083 --> 11:42.051
Address, driver's license,
passport details...

11:42.071 --> 11:44.248
The only thing he changed
was his job.

11:44.273 --> 11:46.015
An elegant plan, really.

11:46.035 --> 11:48.059
He gets a novated lease,
he pays nothing up front.

11:48.079 --> 11:50.432
He passes the credit checks,
drives away,

11:50.457 --> 11:55.011
sells it for $322,000, cash,
ships it overseas.

11:55.031 --> 11:57.031
So, when the lease defaulted,
the finance company

11:57.051 --> 12:00.047
would have gone looking for Simon,
and Todd was untraceable.

12:00.067 --> 12:02.185
At least we know
how he got the cash.

12:02.210 --> 12:04.563
It still can't be
a complete coincidence.

12:05.999 --> 12:08.003
He steals Simon's identity,

12:08.023 --> 12:11.027
he meets Karen to give her a watch
he's bought with Simon's credit card,

12:11.043 --> 12:13.043
and he's shot dead five hours later.

12:13.063 --> 12:16.652
At a point in time when Simon
refuses to tell us where he was.

12:16.677 --> 12:20.030
So, what was he doing that
he doesn't want us to find out?

12:20.055 --> 12:22.031
Shall we?

12:26.995 --> 12:30.035
Simon read the warrant and left -
probably to see his lawyer.

12:30.055 --> 12:33.173
Angry? Defensive?
Placid. Like he knew we'd be coming.

12:33.198 --> 12:34.551
And what have we found?

12:34.995 --> 12:36.039
Nothing - no weapons, money,
or drugs.

12:36.059 --> 12:38.236
But we have his computers.
And phones.

12:48.091 --> 12:51.039
They live with his ex-wife.

13:06.063 --> 13:08.059
(Equipment beeps)

13:19.059 --> 13:21.059
Pretty heavy security.

13:22.063 --> 13:24.019
Let's find the hard drive.

13:24.035 --> 13:26.019
If it's still here.

13:46.075 --> 13:48.019
Sorry, excuse me.

13:49.035 --> 13:52.079
Tim, hi. I'm so sorry!
No, it's fine, here you go.

13:52.976 --> 13:54.035
How are you going?

13:54.055 --> 13:56.644
Good. I'm glad to see you've eaten.
Mmm, mmm.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.846
I'm not usually this late.
No problem.

13:58.999 --> 14:00.470
Kids with the babysitter?

14:00.495 --> 14:03.475
Um, Mum has them during
the week, just while I...

14:04.051 --> 14:06.023
...while I do night hearings.
They good?

14:06.043 --> 14:08.514
Yeah. Um, could I get a glass
of sav blanc?

14:08.539 --> 14:10.304
Just your house, thanks. Um...

14:10.329 --> 14:12.015
Kids. They good?
Yes!

14:12.035 --> 14:15.506
I mean, they're each their own
special thing, I have to say.

14:15.531 --> 14:16.063
(Laughs)

14:16.083 --> 14:18.091
You should come over Saturday,
they would love that.

14:19.011 --> 14:21.035
I'd love to, I've got to
fly back tomorrow though.

14:21.055 --> 14:23.232
I've got a lecture
I can't get out of.

14:23.257 --> 14:25.007
Thank you.

14:25.027 --> 14:28.019
I wonder what Ash
would think about all this -

14:28.039 --> 14:31.999
the three people she was closest to,
squabbling over an embryo.

14:34.007 --> 14:38.007
So, you've joined
as the second respondent and...

14:38.023 --> 14:39.075
Sorry, could you take that? Thanks.

14:39.995 --> 14:42.003
...but we can save you the hassle
of coming to court.

14:42.023 --> 14:43.071
I thought I was supposed
to weigh in?

14:43.091 --> 14:46.031
Not if you support my declaration
and withdraw.

14:46.051 --> 14:49.007
I've drafted up
a set of proposed final orders,

14:49.027 --> 14:52.003
which I can hand up
as our mutual position, so...

14:52.019 --> 14:53.075
...there's no need for us to squabble.

14:53.995 --> 14:57.760
(Laughs) It's, um, not as simple
as hanging on to your petticoat.

15:00.011 --> 15:01.364
Have you spoken to Deb?

15:01.384 --> 15:03.502
Yeah, yeah,
we had dinner last night.

15:03.527 --> 15:06.015
She's quite a terrific lady!

15:06.035 --> 15:08.271
It's not about
who's the better parent,

15:08.296 --> 15:10.355
it's about honouring the agreement.

15:11.035 --> 15:13.023
Isn't it about honouring Ash?

15:26.031 --> 15:28.079
ANDY: If Felix is ever going
to tell Bianca who shot him,

15:28.999 --> 15:31.027
she'll have to play her cards
very carefully.

15:31.047 --> 15:33.039
But I'm sure the Feds
have trained her well.

15:33.059 --> 15:37.059
JANET: Well, I've certainly put my
life in their hands, so I hope so.

15:37.084 --> 15:40.019
They have got this place
under 24/7, yeah?

15:40.039 --> 15:43.392
That's what they tell me.
Good. So, in here you can relax.

15:44.019 --> 15:46.015
It's not a holiday, Owen.

15:48.019 --> 15:50.027
Sorry.

15:50.043 --> 15:53.047
It's just this place.

15:53.063 --> 15:56.091
It feels...

15:57.011 --> 16:00.541
It reminds me of the safehouse
that Ash and the kids were in.

16:02.075 --> 16:06.055
It's just this isolation.

16:06.071 --> 16:08.091
Hey.

16:09.011 --> 16:11.659
They'll make the best of it.
They're kids, eh?

16:12.039 --> 16:14.023
They're adaptable.

16:14.043 --> 16:16.220
It just kills me,
not being with them.

16:16.995 --> 16:20.290
I know, but agonising over it
is not going to help you...

16:20.315 --> 16:22.323
...or them.
I know.

16:24.043 --> 16:25.091
Hey.

16:26.007 --> 16:27.043
We all good?

16:27.059 --> 16:30.003
Yeah.

16:31.059 --> 16:34.015
OK. We've analysed six months
of Felix's movements

16:34.031 --> 16:36.007
using his phone's GPS.

16:36.023 --> 16:37.059
All of that from one phone?

16:37.079 --> 16:40.063
We want you guys to bump into each
other as organically as possible.

16:40.083 --> 16:43.007
With the view of meeting up again.
One step at a time.

16:43.023 --> 16:44.059
Let's just focus on the where.

16:44.079 --> 16:47.043
The Sushi Train. He goes there
every Monday after his shift.

16:47.063 --> 16:51.007
Yeah. I mean, that's one option,
but if he goes there every week,

16:51.027 --> 16:53.019
he might wonder
why he's never seen you before.

16:53.039 --> 16:55.392
What if on the way
to one of these places

16:55.417 --> 16:56.465
she bumps into him
with her groceries?

16:57.003 --> 16:58.047
It's too much traffic noise.

16:58.067 --> 17:01.126
So we need to be somewhere indoors?
Preferably, yeah.

17:01.151 --> 17:03.159
I mean, supermarkets
have always worked well for us,

17:03.999 --> 17:07.058
but the bastard eats at work
and never goes shopping.

17:07.078 --> 17:09.314
I've been there.
Everyone's been there.

17:09.339 --> 17:11.015
Oh, the garlic sauce.
Yeah.

17:11.035 --> 17:13.059
I mean, is it less of a coincidence
if it's well-known?

17:13.079 --> 17:17.047
Slightly, but it means
we have to be on standby

17:17.063 --> 17:19.047
for the day Felix happens to go.

17:19.067 --> 17:22.035
We'd be paying investigators
to watch him for weeks, potentially.

17:22.055 --> 17:25.031
And then when he does go, we'd have
20 minutes to get Bianca there.

17:25.047 --> 17:27.083
We can't wait that long. Sorry.

17:27.999 --> 17:31.027
Let me know what you decide.

17:37.995 --> 17:40.091
EMILY: Look at mine!
Oh, show me. Show me your picture.

17:41.007 --> 17:43.007
Oh, Em. That's gorgeous!

17:43.023 --> 17:45.063
Oh, Liam. That's a good one.

17:45.083 --> 17:49.999
I love your symmetry, Emma.
And look at your swirls.

17:50.019 --> 17:52.035
We should have an exhibition.
Do you wanna do that?

17:52.055 --> 17:53.995
Hey?
(Knock at door)

17:54.015 --> 17:57.011
No, look at mine, Mummy!
One sec.

17:57.031 --> 18:00.015
Anyway, listen. You need to go
to bed now 'cause it's very late.

18:00.035 --> 18:03.011
I love you.
Love, love, love. (Blows kisses)

18:03.031 --> 18:05.071
I love you.
Bye-bye. Bye.

18:05.087 --> 18:08.079
LIAM: I love you, Mummy!

18:08.995 --> 18:10.079
(Video call ends)

18:10.857 --> 18:13.869
Yes?
I thought you might be hungry.

18:13.885 --> 18:15.865
Sorry, I'm interrupting.

18:15.885 --> 18:17.929
No. No, it's fine.
I was just Skyping with the kids.

18:17.945 --> 18:19.881
They had to go to sleep.

18:19.901 --> 18:22.254
I'm starving.
That would be... Thank you.

18:22.865 --> 18:24.949
I just wanted to check you're
settled in alright. Everything good?

18:25.865 --> 18:27.218
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good.

18:27.243 --> 18:28.897
How are the plans going?

18:28.917 --> 18:29.949
Yeah,
Andy came up with a good idea,

18:30.869 --> 18:31.933
made a few phone calls,
got it organised.

18:31.949 --> 18:33.901
What time do I need to be here?

18:33.917 --> 18:35.861
I'm leaving early,

18:35.881 --> 18:37.909
but it's not actually on
till later in the afternoon.

18:37.925 --> 18:39.909
Let me find out for you.

18:39.925 --> 18:42.877
Delicious.

18:45.941 --> 18:48.933
(Phone vibrates)

19:00.941 --> 19:03.861
Andy's phone.

19:03.881 --> 19:05.933
Um, sorry.
Hello?

19:05.949 --> 19:08.945
Lina answered. Shit.

19:09.083 --> 19:11.319
Do you think she recognised
your voice?

19:12.126 --> 19:13.909
I don't think so.

19:13.929 --> 19:17.635
No harm done. Don't worry about it.
I'll speak to Andy tomorrow.

19:17.853 --> 19:20.877
OK. Enjoy your pizza. Night.

19:20.897 --> 19:22.486
You don't want any more?
No.

19:22.853 --> 19:24.857
OK.
Thank you.

19:27.861 --> 19:29.861
Who's Steph?
What?

19:29.881 --> 19:33.176
Steph Baker just called
but when I answered, she hung up.

19:33.201 --> 19:36.189
Oh, right.
She's just... she's in homicide.

19:36.853 --> 19:39.677
She started there
after I moved in with you guys.

19:39.702 --> 19:42.774
Why is she calling at 9:00 at night?
I don't know.

19:42.865 --> 19:46.901
I said if she had any questions
to call any time.

19:46.921 --> 19:48.913
What did she say?
Nothing.

19:48.933 --> 19:51.885
Well, it couldn't have been
that important then.

19:51.901 --> 19:52.929
Well, if it's not important,

19:52.949 --> 19:55.597
can you ask her to call
during business hours?

19:55.622 --> 19:58.093
We could've been
in the middle of anything.

19:58.945 --> 20:01.877
That sounds promising.

20:12.853 --> 20:14.971
This is an hour
before Todd was shot.

20:22.853 --> 20:24.971
And that's an hour and a half after.

20:24.996 --> 20:27.056
Plenty of time to head to Bankstown
and deal with Todd.

20:27.857 --> 20:31.857
If Simon turned off the cameras,
can we even prove he left the house?

20:32.869 --> 20:35.861
What did the data technicians
pull from his phone?

20:35.881 --> 20:38.905
No activity after 2:00 - that was a
call that pinged through Holsworthy.

20:38.925 --> 20:42.861
There's no links on his call records
to Todd, George Healy,

20:42.877 --> 20:43.941
or any of the other Nobakht numbers.

20:44.861 --> 20:47.881
Though there is a call from
an unidentified prepaid mobile.

20:47.901 --> 20:50.372
E-tag?
Not used on the day Todd was killed.

20:50.397 --> 20:51.809
What about his computer?

20:51.853 --> 20:55.795
Techies say some files were deleted
after we served him the summons.

20:55.857 --> 20:56.893
Data recovery is in process.

20:56.913 --> 20:59.893
Might be a bit flimsy, but a few
privates were dismissed last year

20:59.909 --> 21:01.873
after being caught with cocaine.

21:01.889 --> 21:03.853
Hamilton was their CO.

21:04.937 --> 21:07.349
Let's bring them in.
That could be tricky.

21:07.853 --> 21:08.971
They're in Tijuana.

21:08.996 --> 21:10.948
Still can't ignore it.

21:12.941 --> 21:17.937
I remember that. The media said
it was this big distribution ring.

21:18.857 --> 21:19.941
It was just two guys
and personal use.

21:20.857 --> 21:22.799
Was Major Hamilton close to them?

21:22.865 --> 21:24.893
Possibly. He did defend them.

21:24.909 --> 21:26.909
And they'd clearly broken the law.

21:26.929 --> 21:30.865
His attitude was 'Let's not demonise
returned soldiers

21:30.881 --> 21:32.853
who obviously needed help.'

21:32.869 --> 21:33.925
And yet, at the inquest last month,

21:33.945 --> 21:36.905
Hamilton was rather less
understanding

21:36.925 --> 21:40.857
with Corporal Allman's PTSD
and suicide.

21:40.873 --> 21:42.901
So, if he found out what Todd did,

21:42.921 --> 21:45.873
potentially saddling him
with $500,000 in debt,

21:45.893 --> 21:48.952
would he be understanding or...
not so understanding?

21:48.977 --> 21:51.969
Well, I-I don't see him
killing Todd.

21:52.853 --> 21:53.897
But then,

21:53.917 --> 21:57.388
he's not good with anything
where he comes out looking weak.

21:58.913 --> 22:03.881
Karen, you've alluded to having...
issues with Major Hamilton before.

22:03.897 --> 22:05.897
Please, could you...

22:05.913 --> 22:07.877
...expand on that?

22:09.937 --> 22:12.893
It goes back to the ambush
in Uruzgan.

22:15.873 --> 22:18.885
(Sighs) Afterwards,
we were in the mess,

22:18.905 --> 22:21.869
all trying to decompress -
showers, food.

22:21.885 --> 22:24.857
But Major Hamilton was edgy.

22:24.873 --> 22:26.897
He kept scoping the exits.

22:26.917 --> 22:30.857
People started to filter out
and then it was just the two of us

22:30.873 --> 22:32.933
and there was this bang

22:33.853 --> 22:37.324
and he just hit the deck,
like we were being attacked again.

22:37.344 --> 22:41.340
And I worked out it was just
the fridge - the compressor had...

22:41.356 --> 22:43.853
But he just... he flipped.

22:43.869 --> 22:45.933
He was on the floor, screaming.

22:46.853 --> 22:47.909
And I told him
it was just the fridge,

22:47.925 --> 22:49.885
I said we were safe, but he...

22:49.901 --> 22:51.877
...couldn't hear me.

22:52.949 --> 22:55.893
So I just... I sat with him
until he stopped.

22:55.909 --> 22:57.865
And then what happened.

22:57.881 --> 22:59.885
He got up and walked out.

22:59.905 --> 23:02.023
Didn't look me in the eye
for a week.

23:03.889 --> 23:06.857
Now, I-I get his reaction.

23:06.877 --> 23:10.760
One moment you're in control and
then the next, you're outnumbered,

23:10.785 --> 23:13.745
in the open,
facing relentless machine-gun fire.

23:13.901 --> 23:15.857
It's a horrific feeling.

23:16.877 --> 23:19.172
And what's his attitude towards you
now?

23:19.197 --> 23:21.885
He hates that I saw him like that.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.921
And he's been at me ever since.

23:24.937 --> 23:28.349
In front of other soldiers,
he'll accuse me of malingering,

23:28.374 --> 23:31.669
and then he'll punish everyone
and then I get ostracised.

23:32.873 --> 23:35.909
I think... I think it's all aimed
at getting me to quit the Army

23:35.925 --> 23:37.885
and get out of his life

23:37.901 --> 23:39.865
so he doesn't have to be...

23:39.885 --> 23:45.869
...you know, reminded
every time he sees me.

23:47.949 --> 23:51.302
Are we clutching at straws,
trying to link Simon to drugs?

23:51.857 --> 23:52.909
He's definitely hiding something.

23:52.929 --> 23:55.857
I kept looking back
through his security tapes.

23:55.877 --> 23:58.881
The day Todd died wasn't the first
time he'd turned the cameras off.

23:58.901 --> 24:00.949
It's almost weekly, but never
the same day or time of day.

24:01.869 --> 24:03.861
Have you compared that
with his phone records?

24:03.881 --> 24:07.646
So far, it doesn't correspond to
calls to or from any one person.

24:07.671 --> 24:09.727
I'll keep looking.
So, he's hiding his movements.

24:09.861 --> 24:11.881
And he has the means and motive
for murder. The means?

24:11.901 --> 24:14.254
We haven't found a gun.
He's in the Army.

24:14.279 --> 24:16.327
Todd was killed with one shot.

24:16.861 --> 24:19.450
It's either sheer luck
or a trained marksman.

24:19.475 --> 24:23.491
Do we have anything to suggest that
Simon knew what Todd had done?

24:24.869 --> 24:26.164
That's what I thought.

24:30.893 --> 24:32.129
Do you recognise him?

24:32.861 --> 24:35.925
KEISHA: Mm-mm.
Think back to Australia Day.

24:35.945 --> 24:38.865
You were at work,
you were in Todd's car.

24:38.881 --> 24:40.897
He wasn't a customer at the club?

24:40.917 --> 24:43.270
He could have been,
but I didn't see him.

24:43.290 --> 24:46.218
You didn't see him
after you got into the car?

24:46.238 --> 24:48.861
Mm-mm.
We just have to check.

24:48.881 --> 24:50.921
You know, sometimes
the photos trigger something.

24:50.941 --> 24:54.000
My only trigger is bright lights
and confined spaces.

24:54.025 --> 24:56.957
No more raves, then.
(Giggles)

24:59.941 --> 25:02.921
She likes you.
You think?

25:02.941 --> 25:05.059
Oh, God, Richard,
of course she does.

25:05.857 --> 25:08.034
What did Janet say about you and her?

25:08.059 --> 25:11.917
Oh... there's no rule against it
but, you know, be discreet.

25:11.937 --> 25:14.889
It's not a good look.
Exactly my thoughts.

25:14.909 --> 25:18.204
We're a Royal Commission.
There's no trial to compromise.

25:18.229 --> 25:19.877
No, I think it should wait.

25:19.893 --> 25:21.865
You're overthinking.

25:21.885 --> 25:24.853
Rule of thumb - when in public,
keep it G-rated.

25:27.858 --> 25:29.917
Somewhere not too loud, or crowded.

25:29.933 --> 25:31.917
Rena's, opposite the karaoke place.

25:31.937 --> 25:34.861
Told Andy the same.
We should all go there one night.

25:34.881 --> 25:36.877
Funny - I think
that's where we went last time.

25:36.897 --> 25:38.885
She didn't like it?
She liked the bar.

25:38.905 --> 25:41.258
Just... the date
wasn't a raging success.

25:41.283 --> 25:44.048
Still, maybe it's time
to get back on the horse.

25:44.073 --> 25:46.132
Who's the lucky girl?
Just a friend.

26:55.949 --> 26:58.857
Lina?

26:58.877 --> 27:02.054
Do we still have Todd's phone?
I gave you his contacts.

27:02.079 --> 27:03.727
No, I need the actual phone.

27:07.897 --> 27:09.937
Come and have a look at this.

27:10.853 --> 27:12.912
When I first saw the list of people

27:12.937 --> 27:14.005
Todd called
in the week before his death,

27:14.865 --> 27:17.913
initially I had thought
that this one...

27:17.929 --> 27:19.889
...was a mistake.

27:19.909 --> 27:21.909
It's no name,
just a little square symbol.

27:21.929 --> 27:24.889
That's what your phone displays
when it doesn't have emoji.

27:24.905 --> 27:26.905
So I went through Todd's contacts,

27:26.925 --> 27:29.396
thinking maybe
one was lost in translation,

27:29.421 --> 27:32.333
and... voila.

27:32.937 --> 27:35.881
Todd saved his Ferrari dealer
into his phone

27:35.897 --> 27:37.881
using an emoji of a car.

27:37.897 --> 27:39.897
How'd you think of this?

27:39.917 --> 27:42.881
Um, I was just texting someone
myself

27:42.901 --> 27:45.901
and I thought, 'Will they see the
emoji or just the square symbol?'

27:45.921 --> 27:47.925
Bloody Gen Y.
(Laughter)

27:47.945 --> 27:52.869
Anyway, the number is registered
to a Faraz Assan,

27:52.885 --> 27:55.003
convicted in 2012 of car rebirthing.

27:55.028 --> 27:57.617
Who, two days ago,
boarded a plane to Beirut.

27:57.861 --> 27:58.921
Get this to State Crime Command.

27:58.941 --> 28:02.000
If he's in Lebanon,
there's only so much they can do.

28:02.025 --> 28:04.849
At least we've made some progress
for the victim,

28:04.874 --> 28:05.992
even if it's small.

28:09.901 --> 28:12.921
Todd bought the car
using another person's identity

28:12.941 --> 28:16.885
and, in all likelihood, on-sold it
to a foreign buyer.

28:16.901 --> 28:18.937
That's where the money came from.

28:19.857 --> 28:22.925
And the finance company he fooled
also insured your house, Elaheh.

28:22.945 --> 28:25.897
In his mind, he was
probably just righting a wrong.

28:25.913 --> 28:27.933
Yes, he was. Todd hated injustice.

28:28.853 --> 28:31.148
Unfortunately,
his solution was a crime.

28:31.173 --> 28:34.897
Are you saying that if he were
alive, you'd be charging him now?

28:34.917 --> 28:36.901
Us? No!
The police, yes.

28:36.921 --> 28:39.905
Identity theft, fraud -
they're criminal acts.

28:39.921 --> 28:41.941
So is murder!

28:42.857 --> 28:44.897
So, who killed my husband?

28:44.917 --> 28:47.917
Was it the man
whose identity he took

28:47.933 --> 28:49.889
or the guy who sold him the car?

28:49.909 --> 28:53.674
Is that who put bullets through
our windows and almost killed us?

28:53.699 --> 28:56.659
I promised to give you answers
as we found them.

28:59.893 --> 29:01.949
So... you still don't know?

29:09.937 --> 29:12.901
Don't do that.
Don't push your bowl away, Emma.

29:12.921 --> 29:15.098
You said they loved cereal
as a snack.

29:15.123 --> 29:18.873
Emma does, but she likes it dry
with a cup of milk on the side.

29:18.889 --> 29:20.948
I've told you that, Mum. It's no...

29:20.973 --> 29:23.937
Did you do drawings at preschool?

29:24.933 --> 29:27.889
Oh, that's fantastic! I love that.

29:27.909 --> 29:29.921
Do you like Liam's drawing?
No.

29:29.941 --> 29:32.897
That's not very nice.
I like yours.

29:32.917 --> 29:35.949
See, he likes yours.
'Cause it's scribbly.

29:36.869 --> 29:38.909
It's not scribbly!
No, it's not!

29:38.929 --> 29:40.873
Yes, it is!
Liam, it's beautiful.

29:43.873 --> 29:45.881
No, it's not!
Yes, it is!

29:45.897 --> 29:48.857
Don't fight! Can you not fight?

29:48.877 --> 29:52.877
Oh, there's milk on the keyboard.
Mum, just wipe it off!

29:52.897 --> 29:55.133
I haven't seen them for...
Bye for now.

29:55.158 --> 29:58.394
Can I... I just wanna see them one...
(Call disconnects)

29:58.937 --> 30:00.889
...one more time.

30:25.949 --> 30:28.889
We might have time for lunch after.

30:28.909 --> 30:32.262
Ah, just passed a place
that does Bloody Marys. (Chuckles)

30:32.287 --> 30:33.905
How'd it go with Tim?

30:33.925 --> 30:36.861
Well, I thought,
but he hasn't emailed consent.

30:36.881 --> 30:40.861
Today is housekeeping. You won't
need that until the trial, anyway.

30:40.877 --> 30:42.230
Stop saying the T-word!

30:42.869 --> 30:44.987
But of course
there won't be a trial!

30:45.012 --> 30:46.853
Over there.

30:46.873 --> 30:49.991
The substantial question
is to the measure of damages.

30:50.016 --> 30:53.905
I order that
the first and second defendants

30:53.925 --> 30:56.913
file any affidavits
on which they seek to rely

30:56.933 --> 31:01.897
ahead of a final hearing
in two weeks' time.

31:03.877 --> 31:05.937
You're excused.
Tim's here.

31:06.857 --> 31:08.975
Perhaps he brought the form
with him.

31:09.857 --> 31:11.937
Right. Larsson and King.

31:15.945 --> 31:21.869
I see by your presence today
that mediation wasn't successful.

31:21.889 --> 31:25.857
Uh, Your Honour, I'm wondering if
we could resolve this matter today.

31:25.873 --> 31:27.861
This is a directions list, Ms King.

31:27.881 --> 31:29.893
But if Your Honour
would hear submissions today,

31:29.909 --> 31:32.027
I don't think they'd take very long.

31:32.052 --> 31:33.992
Mr Cusack?

31:34.941 --> 31:37.861
If Your Honour pleases.
Sorry, can I speak?

31:37.881 --> 31:40.865
Who are you?
Timothy Dolan, the paternal donor.

31:40.885 --> 31:41.945
Your Honour,
if I can assist the court,

31:42.865 --> 31:45.101
Mr Dolan is
the second-named respondent

31:45.865 --> 31:47.983
and I can speak on his behalf today.

31:49.921 --> 31:51.901
As I understand it,

31:51.921 --> 31:56.897
Ms Larsson, the applicant,
is seeking a declaration

31:56.917 --> 31:59.094
that the frozen embryo
belongs to her.

31:59.256 --> 32:02.889
Ms King, the first-named respondent,
is seeking the same.

32:02.905 --> 32:04.913
What is your position, Mr Dolan?

32:04.933 --> 32:07.463
I don't consent to
either of them having it.

32:08.937 --> 32:11.869
Do you wish for it
to remain in storage?

32:11.885 --> 32:12.921
Or do you want it for yourself?

32:12.941 --> 32:15.877
I'm seeking an order
that it be destroyed.

32:15.897 --> 32:18.905
Your Honour, Mr Dolan waived
parental responsibility at the ti...

32:18.925 --> 32:21.984
In regards to a child.
We're talking about an embryo.

32:22.009 --> 32:23.480
It's my genetic material,

32:23.853 --> 32:25.897
so I should have the right
to decide what happens to it.

32:25.917 --> 32:27.897
Is a frozen embryo
a potential child?

32:27.917 --> 32:29.889
That is the issue at hand,
Your Honour.

32:29.909 --> 32:31.909
It's eight undifferentiated cells,
Your Honour.

32:31.929 --> 32:35.047
It can no more be defined as life
than nail clippings.

32:35.072 --> 32:38.012
But it's not your egg, Ms King.

32:38.881 --> 32:41.921
No. My partner, Ash - Ms Larsson -
provided the egg.

32:41.941 --> 32:44.941
And she's deceased.
Yes, but if Your Honour would...

32:44.966 --> 32:49.861
On reflection, I believe that you
are all in the wrong jurisdiction,

32:49.877 --> 32:51.861
because there is someone deceased

32:51.881 --> 32:54.764
and there is potential property
to be distributed.

32:54.789 --> 32:56.929
This is a probate issue.

32:56.949 --> 32:59.885
This is ridiculous.
You can't just palm us off!

32:59.905 --> 33:02.082
Ms King!
Your language is intemperate.

33:02.107 --> 33:04.143
It's a simple declaration.
I'm the next of kin...

33:04.865 --> 33:05.917
I beg your pardon, Your Honour.

33:05.937 --> 33:09.869
I seek leave to appear as
a friend of the court for Ms King.

33:09.889 --> 33:11.897
Mr Gillies?
That's correct, Your Honour.

33:11.917 --> 33:14.881
Would anyone else like to join?
Shall we have a show of hands?

33:14.897 --> 33:16.921
What Ms King is trying to say...

33:16.941 --> 33:19.929
I am making orders
to transfer this matter

33:19.949 --> 33:22.877
to the probate
contentious matters list.

33:25.731 --> 33:29.941
Next, we have the matter
of Paul and Robb.

33:30.857 --> 33:32.877
Uh, Janet...

33:37.869 --> 33:38.917
What was that?

33:38.937 --> 33:40.893
TIM: I can't choose
between you and Deb.

33:40.913 --> 33:42.929
You could've said,
'Store it until they work it out, '

33:42.945 --> 33:44.885
not 'Melt it, Your Honour.'

33:44.905 --> 33:45.945
What happened?
Why would you do that?

33:46.865 --> 33:48.853
My donation was based on
certain circumstances.

33:48.873 --> 33:50.913
We're in a different place now.
What place would that be?

33:50.933 --> 33:53.901
If I give it to you, Deb hates me.
If I give it to her, you hate me.

33:53.921 --> 33:56.889
It's not about you! Don't you
understand what this means to us?

33:56.905 --> 33:58.857
I'm thinking of the child!

33:58.877 --> 34:00.941
I don't want it being forbidden
to see Aunty Janet or Aunty Deb

34:01.857 --> 34:02.901
because of a decision I made.

34:02.921 --> 34:04.921
Ash was my sister.
I'd never stop them seeing Janet.

34:04.941 --> 34:07.877
I can't believe you're doing this.
It wasn't an easy decision.

34:07.897 --> 34:10.860
It shouldn't be your decision!
You can't do this.

34:10.880 --> 34:12.937
Yes, we disagree, but
it's not your place to come in...

34:13.857 --> 34:17.916
It actually is my place. It would be
my child in this toxic situation.

34:17.940 --> 34:21.235
Ash wouldn't have wanted...
Don't you dare speak for her!

34:31.909 --> 34:34.321
Why couldn't you have
just let me have it?

34:34.853 --> 34:36.900
It's still a part of Ash.

34:37.945 --> 34:40.877
I'm sorry.
You can't blame me for this.

35:52.861 --> 35:56.889
For ages, I thought if they found
who killed her, it would...

35:56.905 --> 35:58.889
...unlock everything.

35:59.933 --> 36:01.929
I could move on.

36:03.913 --> 36:07.909
Make decisions about the embryo,
start seeing other people.

36:10.865 --> 36:12.861
It's not that at all.

36:16.889 --> 36:18.885
I'm still with her.

36:20.921 --> 36:23.917
I'm still... in the relationship.

36:23.933 --> 36:25.873
Yeah.

36:25.889 --> 36:27.873
Could have told you this.

36:27.893 --> 36:31.853
What we know, what we do
and what we feel...

36:31.869 --> 36:33.893
...it has no unity.

36:33.913 --> 36:36.737
Well, if everything we felt and did
were logical,

36:36.762 --> 36:39.674
there'd be no need for
places like this.

36:43.853 --> 36:45.949
(Sighs) But that isn't life.

36:46.865 --> 36:48.949
Ah, life's a shit fight.

36:51.624 --> 36:53.708
And we can't do right by everyone.

36:54.279 --> 36:57.363
So we stick to our principles,
ride out the mess...

36:58.671 --> 37:00.671
...embrace single malt scotch.

37:03.898 --> 37:05.894
And keep moving.

37:17.295 --> 37:19.291
Come on.

37:42.287 --> 37:43.339
Hey.

37:43.359 --> 37:46.303
Lina.
Huh?

37:46.323 --> 37:49.279
Maybe not now.
I think I found something important.

37:49.299 --> 37:52.311
(Door slams)
What happened?

37:54.315 --> 37:56.331
I don't know exactly. Just...

38:16.371 --> 38:18.367
(Phone rings)

38:21.303 --> 38:23.656
There you are.
Wondered where you got to.

38:23.681 --> 38:26.283
What's happened?
Are you alone? Yes.

38:26.303 --> 38:28.539
We've commenced the operation
on Felix.

38:28.564 --> 38:31.741
I've sent you the link
if you want to follow the audio.

38:33.307 --> 38:36.307
Bit of a problem, yeah?
Yeah, alternator apparently.

38:36.323 --> 38:38.347
Oh, yeah? Bloody annoying, eh?

38:38.367 --> 38:41.838
Still, shouldn't be a problem.
Just get it down to the shop.

38:41.863 --> 38:43.863
They should be able to
have it fixed pretty quick.

38:44.287 --> 38:46.275
Don't have to be anywhere, do you?
Oh, not now.

38:46.295 --> 38:48.331
But I'll need it tomorrow for work.
Oh, no worries.

38:48.351 --> 38:50.367
They'll have it done in half an hour
if you're lucky.

38:51.283 --> 38:52.695
How far away's the shop?

38:52.720 --> 38:55.191
Five minutes,
just across the railway line.

38:55.283 --> 38:56.367
Oh, OK. Cool.

39:05.355 --> 39:08.275
Felix is en route, we're all set.

39:08.295 --> 39:10.943
Oh, great.
Listen, I'll have to call you back.

39:10.968 --> 39:12.936
As soon as I can. Thanks, bye.

39:15.327 --> 39:17.299
Yes?
I've got something.

39:19.343 --> 39:22.335
One of the programs Simon deleted
off his laptop was for 3D printing.

39:22.355 --> 39:24.351
Is that it?
Well, what was he printing?

39:24.367 --> 39:26.303
We're still recovering the files

39:26.323 --> 39:28.311
but we know
they're attached to that program.

39:28.327 --> 39:30.445
I saw this documentary on 3D organs.

39:30.465 --> 39:33.441
They use living cells instead of ink
and build up a cornea in layers.

39:33.457 --> 39:35.283
Yeah, they've done 3D cars.

39:35.303 --> 39:38.127
They're working on aircraft parts.
Owen Mitchell.

39:38.152 --> 39:40.200
Why delete it though
if it's just body bits or car parts?

39:40.287 --> 39:41.363
Can we tell
when he used the program?

39:42.283 --> 39:44.343
If he was printing something
when the security system was down,

39:44.363 --> 39:46.303
it might tell us something.
Yeah.

39:46.323 --> 39:48.335
There's a container
arriving at the docks tonight,

39:48.351 --> 39:50.283
imported by Simon Hamilton.

39:50.303 --> 39:51.331
Arriving?
Uh-huh.

39:51.351 --> 39:54.335
Why's something coming in? Todd
got his money from exporting a car.

39:54.355 --> 39:57.650
Well, obviously, Simon's onto
a different form of income.

39:57.675 --> 40:00.323
And I doubt it's got anything to do
with cars.

40:01.335 --> 40:04.331
The bill of loading says 'fridges'.
I'll believe that when I see it.

40:04.351 --> 40:07.116
Is it Simon Hamilton
or Todd using his identity?

40:07.283 --> 40:08.363
If it is Simon, what's he importing?

40:09.283 --> 40:11.311
Well, he's either opened
a wholesale business in fridges

40:11.327 --> 40:13.295
or it's a prohibited substance.

40:13.311 --> 40:14.347
What's this about fridges?

40:14.367 --> 40:16.897
Simon Hamilton's importing
a container load.

40:16.922 --> 40:18.906
Where from, San Diego?

40:21.279 --> 40:22.355
Yes.

40:22.371 --> 40:25.295
It's often cocaine from Mexico.

40:25.315 --> 40:27.311
It comes over the land border
with California,

40:27.331 --> 40:30.291
sails down the green line
from San Diego to Brisbane,

40:30.311 --> 40:32.311
then here and then Melbourne.
In fridges?

40:32.331 --> 40:34.347
All sorts of ways.
White goods, soup cans, clothing.

40:34.367 --> 40:37.343
Usually without much relevance
to the importer's core business.

40:37.363 --> 40:40.311
Maybe Simon's still in touch with
those privates in Tijuana?

40:40.331 --> 40:42.331
We won't know what's in the container
until we look.

40:42.351 --> 40:45.295
The port authority will call tonight
when it's off the ship.

40:45.315 --> 40:47.275
We can open it, examine it,
lock it back up.

40:47.295 --> 40:50.295
They'll tell Simon it's landed
when we want them to.

40:50.311 --> 40:52.194
Do we have to stay back tonight?

40:52.219 --> 40:55.155
Not you. You've done enough overtime.

41:00.295 --> 41:02.884
Shouldn't be too long, mate.
You'll be right.

41:02.909 --> 41:04.941
Thanks.

41:37.335 --> 41:39.291
Hey there.

41:39.307 --> 41:41.291
Uh...

41:41.307 --> 41:43.291
Yeah, I'm just, um...

41:43.307 --> 41:45.291
Just getting my wheels fixed.

41:45.307 --> 41:46.837
Think it's the alternator.

41:47.283 --> 41:48.578
Shouldn't be too long.

41:48.603 --> 41:50.603
You good to wait?
Yeah, definitely.

41:51.335 --> 41:53.291
Have we...?

41:54.339 --> 41:56.287
Have we met before?

41:58.355 --> 42:00.311
Far out.

42:00.327 --> 42:01.371
We have.

42:02.287 --> 42:04.323
In the...

42:07.319 --> 42:09.295
Felix.

42:10.339 --> 42:12.279
Steph.

42:12.299 --> 42:15.303
I'll just replace the alternator and
whack in a new battery. Ten minutes?

42:15.319 --> 42:17.287
Sure.

42:20.283 --> 42:22.311
Look, I'm...

42:22.331 --> 42:26.339
Are you with Roadside Assist?
Ah, yeah. Yeah, I've got it here.

42:26.355 --> 42:28.371
All good then. Nothing to pay.

42:30.295 --> 42:31.363
Oh.

42:32.279 --> 42:34.343
Well, Steph...

42:36.311 --> 42:38.841
So, how's your world been
since we last met?

42:38.866 --> 42:40.323
Getting any better?

42:40.343 --> 42:44.283
Do you want the two-second answer
or the two-hour answer?

42:45.303 --> 42:47.009
Let's start with two seconds.

42:47.363 --> 42:50.287
No.

43:01.363 --> 43:04.295
You have a map?

43:04.315 --> 43:08.080
Geography's not my forte, alright?
You're lucky I found this bar.

43:08.105 --> 43:09.351
It was your idea.

43:09.371 --> 43:12.724
Well, I'd heard about it,
I just haven't been here before.

43:17.359 --> 43:19.355
Hey, I just wanted to say,

43:20.275 --> 43:22.343
the reason I was at that
gun commission thing...

43:22.363 --> 43:25.319
...it's not because
I've done something wrong.

43:25.335 --> 43:27.347
Steph, you don't need to explain.

43:27.367 --> 43:30.371
I don't need
the full two-hour answer.

43:32.283 --> 43:33.519
It's the same for me.

43:33.544 --> 43:35.492
It's in the past.

43:36.307 --> 43:37.366
It's not who I am.

43:58.291 --> 44:01.283
Well, at least you left your past
in the past.

44:01.299 --> 44:02.335
My problem is...

44:02.351 --> 44:04.347
...mine keeps finding me.

44:06.331 --> 44:08.279
Well, it's up to you.

44:08.295 --> 44:10.413
Happy to listen if you want to vent.

44:11.275 --> 44:13.746
Or we can drink wine
and discuss geography.

44:13.771 --> 44:15.007
I'm happy either way.

44:16.311 --> 44:18.275
Or I could watch you
text someone else

44:18.295 --> 44:21.001
while I completely fail
to hold your attention.

44:21.026 --> 44:23.732
No, sorry. It's just work -
I forgot something.

44:24.303 --> 44:26.279
Done now.

44:27.287 --> 44:29.287
Phones away?
Sure.

44:29.303 --> 44:30.339
Phones away.

44:32.335 --> 44:34.327
(Text alert pings)

44:34.343 --> 44:36.307
OWEN: Is that her?

44:36.327 --> 44:39.319
'RK here too.'
What?

44:39.339 --> 44:41.307
Who the hell's RK?
RK...

44:43.279 --> 44:44.327
RK!

44:46.339 --> 44:48.287
Richard and Keisha?

44:48.303 --> 44:49.319
Shit!

44:49.335 --> 44:51.303
What if he says hi to Bianca?

44:53.287 --> 44:55.287
Let's have a drink. Tequila shots?

44:55.303 --> 44:57.275
Wow. Ah, beer's fine.

44:57.291 --> 44:59.279
I was kidding. Two beers then.

44:59.299 --> 45:00.343
OK. Well, no,
let... let me get them.

45:00.363 --> 45:02.540
No. I've got to make up
for last time.

45:02.565 --> 45:04.501
OK.

45:08.371 --> 45:11.299
Hey. Ah, two pints of pale ale.

45:11.315 --> 45:13.287
Thanks.

45:27.291 --> 45:29.291
You sure you should text her?
Yeah.

45:29.316 --> 45:31.260
She has to get out.

45:33.335 --> 45:35.299
(Message alert pings)

45:35.319 --> 45:37.496
Well, if you have to get it,
that's...

45:37.521 --> 45:41.698
No, it's probably just him and he's
everything I want to keep away from.

45:49.343 --> 45:51.367
(Phone rings)
Andy.

45:53.323 --> 45:55.311
Janet?

45:55.327 --> 45:56.916
Yes, it's just me and Owen.

45:57.287 --> 46:00.283
Did Bianca just text you? My eyes
in the room says she used her phone.

46:00.303 --> 46:04.127
But I didn't receive anything.
Yeah. Richard and Keisha are there.

46:04.287 --> 46:05.343
Oh, shit!

46:07.311 --> 46:10.295
Wait - why is she texting you?
I'm only the field commander.

46:10.315 --> 46:12.343
I told her to get out.
What?

46:12.363 --> 46:15.295
I thought you were only observing
my operation.

46:15.315 --> 46:17.359
Look, I have got time
for 'who's the boss' games, alright?

46:18.279 --> 46:20.299
She texted me.
This is really important.

46:20.319 --> 46:22.331
I know that. But you can't
make arbitrary decisions.

46:22.351 --> 46:24.822
We don't know where Richard is
in that bar.

46:25.335 --> 46:27.355
KEISHA: Girl in the blue,
guy in the blazer.

46:27.371 --> 46:29.323
What date - first or second?

46:29.343 --> 46:31.275
What date?
Mm.

46:33.371 --> 46:36.275
Solid eye contact.
Mm-hm.

46:36.291 --> 46:37.762
Ooh, their knees touched.

46:37.787 --> 46:39.279
Knees?
Yeah.

46:39.299 --> 46:40.367
It's gotta be first.
Definitely first date.

46:41.283 --> 46:43.331
Oh, OK. Ah...

46:43.347 --> 46:45.283
Guy in the aqua shirt,

46:45.303 --> 46:46.335
Girl in the... Don't look now.
No.

46:46.355 --> 46:48.311
Girl in the floral dress.
Behind you.

46:48.331 --> 46:50.331
Behind me?
Yeah. What do you think?

46:50.356 --> 46:52.331
They look like cousins.
What?

46:52.347 --> 46:54.275
Oh, my God.

46:54.291 --> 46:55.335
OK. What do we do now?

46:55.355 --> 46:57.826
You call Richard right now
and you tell him

46:57.851 --> 47:00.791
you want him back at the office
immediately.

47:01.315 --> 47:02.363
OK.

47:06.363 --> 47:08.335
How long ago did you leave him?

47:08.351 --> 47:10.323
Oh, like...

47:10.339 --> 47:12.275
...six months ago.

47:12.295 --> 47:15.343
He just won't accept it.
That's the problem.

47:15.359 --> 47:17.307
Have you tried an AVO?

47:17.323 --> 47:19.382
Yeah, right. Like they really work.

47:19.407 --> 47:21.335
Um, OK...

47:22.295 --> 47:24.472
Ooh - brunette
with the hoop earrings,

47:25.275 --> 47:27.343
guy in green shirt who looks
like he's punching above his weight.

47:28.359 --> 47:31.335
Whereabouts?
Um, about your two o'clock.

47:31.355 --> 47:33.351
(Phone chimes)
Damn it!

47:35.355 --> 47:37.347
Sorry.

47:38.355 --> 47:40.303
Ah, yes. Janet.

47:40.319 --> 47:42.291
What, now?

47:42.311 --> 47:44.547
No, no. No, it's fine.
I can come back.

47:45.335 --> 47:47.299
Alright. I'll see you soon.

47:49.287 --> 47:50.355
I am so sorry.

47:59.307 --> 48:00.896
When Janet calls, you jump?

48:01.275 --> 48:02.511
Well, she's the boss.

48:02.536 --> 48:04.283
Still, at half past eight...

48:04.299 --> 48:06.241
Well, I'll make it up to you, OK?

48:06.287 --> 48:07.355
We'll have a night together,
I promise.

48:07.371 --> 48:09.343
Or dinner, at least.

48:09.363 --> 48:14.287
I mean, when I say a night together
I don't mean...

48:14.303 --> 48:15.347
...overnight. Not necessarily.

48:15.363 --> 48:17.299
I should stop talking,

48:17.319 --> 48:20.295
before it is impossible to get out
of this conversation gracefully.

48:20.315 --> 48:23.319
You sure you don't have a girlfriend
stuck in some law firm in the city?

48:23.339 --> 48:25.319
No!
I, I like you.

48:34.331 --> 48:37.299
Well, go then, not-boyfriend.

48:46.343 --> 48:48.291
Nothing gets through.

48:48.307 --> 48:50.307
I can scream, yell, beg - nothing.

48:52.367 --> 48:55.327
But at least he's not here now...

48:57.303 --> 48:59.291
That's one good thing.

48:59.311 --> 49:01.547
It's just you and me here now,
which...

49:02.355 --> 49:04.371
...I hope that's OK to say.

49:07.291 --> 49:08.339
Sure.

49:35.299 --> 49:37.335
(Phone rings)

49:39.303 --> 49:41.367
Owen Mitchell.

49:42.283 --> 49:44.287
Janet? Simon's container's here.

49:45.327 --> 49:47.371
Yup, OK.
Yeah, got it.

49:48.291 --> 49:50.307
Customs and Federal Police are going
to meet us there.

49:50.323 --> 49:52.367
LINA: Good luck!

49:53.283 --> 49:54.323
Come on, Richard!

49:54.343 --> 49:56.991
What happened to too much overtime?
Follow us.

49:57.016 --> 49:59.964
Heather,
could you help me out a second?

50:00.307 --> 50:02.351
Sure, I was just doing bugger-all.

50:04.287 --> 50:07.405
What are these files,
recovered from Simon's computer?

50:09.279 --> 50:11.303
Let the search engine do the work.

50:11.319 --> 50:12.347
Yes!

50:13.291 --> 50:14.880
Upload it, search by image.

50:15.287 --> 50:17.279
There you go, girl.

50:49.319 --> 50:51.614
Where's Bianca?
Don't worry, she's safe.

50:51.639 --> 50:55.315
Felix is none the wiser
and they've texted up to meet again.

50:55.335 --> 50:57.291
This is the one?
Mm-hm.

51:00.359 --> 51:04.283
We often find the cocaine
in the door panels,

51:04.303 --> 51:07.287
but sometimes, if they think
they're hiding under our radar,

51:07.307 --> 51:09.351
they'll just have the packets
sitting on the shelves,

51:09.367 --> 51:11.355
and it's just inside the fridge.

51:11.371 --> 51:13.307
So, anything's possible.

51:33.327 --> 51:37.275
Let's compare the image search
on the screen to Simon's files.

51:40.331 --> 51:42.331
Look at this -

51:43.339 --> 51:45.295
'The Liberator'.

51:45.311 --> 51:46.359
What?

51:54.335 --> 51:56.287
Oh, my God.

51:56.303 --> 51:58.295
Whoa.

52:08.283 --> 52:09.351
(Phone rings)

52:12.339 --> 52:14.315
Lina?
Hey.

52:14.335 --> 52:17.394
Um, that file that Simon deleted
from his computer...

52:17.419 --> 52:19.407
Yeah?
It's a gun.

52:20.275 --> 52:21.746
A file to 3D-print a gun.

52:23.311 --> 52:25.295
OK.

52:25.311 --> 52:27.076
Let's see what we've got here.

53:24.275 --> 53:26.335
JANET: We're on. Shut the container,
we'll make the call.

53:27.331 --> 53:30.743
No calls to anyone, no sense
of excitement, fear - nothing.

53:31.287 --> 53:32.327
Have they been tipped off?

53:32.347 --> 53:34.642
Janet doesn't think
we finished the job.

53:34.667 --> 53:36.331
Is that the implication?
No.

53:36.347 --> 53:38.307
We do not respond to threats.

53:38.327 --> 53:40.563
I merely explain
what I need to happen!

53:40.588 --> 53:42.331
If you hang me out to dry...

53:42.347 --> 53:45.283
...I will destroy you.

53:46.275 --> 53:48.275
They got me...
What, what happened?

53:48.300 --> 53:50.319
...please! Please! (Sobs)

53:50.339 --> 53:52.692
You talked, didn't you?
I've got to know!
