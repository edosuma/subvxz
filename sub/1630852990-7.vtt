00:13.138 --> 00:14.389
<i>You could have told me.</i>

00:14.472 --> 00:15.598
<i>What was I supposed to say?</i>

00:15.682 --> 00:19.144
<i>Your father is wanted by the FBI,</i>
<i>and he would kill us if he got the chance?</i>

00:20.979 --> 00:23.982
<i>What is it about that money?</i>
<i>Why does Jasper want it?</i>

00:24.065 --> 00:25.650
<i>He tried to kill me to get it.</i>

00:26.860 --> 00:28.695
<i>You're going to get caught.</i>

00:28.778 --> 00:30.029
<i>I'm just getting started.</i>

00:32.782 --> 00:34.784
<i>Nick is out there somewhere.</i>

00:34.868 --> 00:36.953
<i>You just need to… disappear.</i>

00:37.537 --> 00:39.205
<i>Stop right there!</i>

00:42.417 --> 00:44.335
<i>- Where are you going?</i>
<i>- You have to trust me.</i>

00:44.419 --> 00:46.129
<i>Why the fuck would I do that?</i>

01:44.562 --> 01:45.480
<i>It's time.</i>

02:20.849 --> 02:23.184
<i>Four years is a long time.</i>

02:24.894 --> 02:26.938
<i>Four years, eight months, three days.</i>

02:28.314 --> 02:30.441
<i>That was the deal Jane Queller,</i>
<i>convicted felon,</i>

02:30.525 --> 02:32.110
<i>made with the U.S. Attorney.</i>

02:32.193 --> 02:33.194
<i>The good news?</i>

02:33.278 --> 02:35.989
<i>Laura Randall doesn't even</i>
<i>have a parking ticket.</i>

02:36.072 --> 02:37.198
<i>Laura?</i>

02:39.784 --> 02:41.369
<i>So that's my name.</i>

02:41.452 --> 02:43.371
<i>When you walk out of here today, yeah.</i>

02:44.414 --> 02:46.124
<i>Come on. I'll talk you through it.</i>

02:52.672 --> 02:55.174
<i>You're a widowed single mother</i>
<i>from Rhode Island.</i>

02:56.092 --> 02:58.303
<i>Your parents died in a fire</i>
<i>when you were 18.</i>

02:58.887 --> 02:59.846
<i>You married young.</i>

03:00.930 --> 03:02.390
<i>To Jerry Randall?</i>

03:02.473 --> 03:05.393
<i>Who was killed in a car crash</i>
<i>when your daughter was two years old.</i>

03:05.977 --> 03:06.853
<i>Tragic.</i>

03:14.736 --> 03:16.654
<i>You changed Andy's birthday.</i>

03:17.280 --> 03:18.114
<i>Yours, too.</i>

03:18.990 --> 03:20.033
<i>That's protocol.</i>

03:21.409 --> 03:24.704
<i>You and your daughter</i>
<i>moved to Georgia for a fresh start.</i>

03:24.787 --> 03:25.997
<i>Belle Isle?</i>

03:26.706 --> 03:29.792
<i>A retirement community.</i>
<i>You won't get much trouble there.</i>

03:30.752 --> 03:32.921
<i>The middle of nowhere with mosquitos.</i>

03:35.298 --> 03:36.299
<i>These are for you.</i>

03:49.062 --> 03:50.104
<i>Talbots?</i>

03:50.730 --> 03:51.689
<i>What you wear.</i>

03:52.232 --> 03:53.483
<i>How you talk.</i>

03:53.566 --> 03:55.443
<i>The car you drive. The food you like.</i>

03:55.526 --> 03:57.153
<i>Nothing can signal Jane Queller.</i>

03:57.237 --> 03:59.238
<i>Don't worry, she's long gone.</i>

04:06.079 --> 04:08.289
<i>For Andrea. This is Wish Bear.</i>

04:08.373 --> 04:11.084
<i>My daughter says she's the best.</i>

04:15.213 --> 04:17.173
<i>I know you're nervous about seeing her.</i>

04:17.257 --> 04:19.592
<i>She doesn't even know who I am.</i>

05:34.959 --> 05:35.835
<i>Andy.</i>

05:37.920 --> 05:38.796
<i>Hey, Charlie.</i>

05:41.507 --> 05:42.550
<i>Where's your mom?</i>

05:45.303 --> 05:46.971
<i>In a dark gray Chevy Malibu.</i>

05:47.055 --> 05:49.974
- <i>California plates. H793
- WVZ.</i>

06:13.039 --> 06:15.750
<i>1.7 million unpaid American jobs.</i>

06:15.833 --> 06:19.879
<i>But so many of our products like autos</i>
<i>are built on both sides of the border</i>

06:19.962 --> 06:21.506
<i>in an integrated supply chain.</i>

06:22.090 --> 06:26.052
<i>This co-production makes us work better</i>
<i>in the global economy as a whole.</i>

06:26.135 --> 06:27.220
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

06:27.303 --> 06:28.513
<i>Yeah. Fine.</i>

06:34.102 --> 06:34.977
<i>Blanket?</i>

06:35.061 --> 06:36.771
<i>No, you should go home.</i>

06:36.854 --> 06:39.565
<i>I'll, uh…</i>
<i>I'll just call you when I'm done.</i>

06:39.649 --> 06:40.650
<i>No, I'll stay.</i>

06:41.400 --> 06:43.402
<i>Really? For four hours?</i>

06:43.486 --> 06:45.154
<i>That's silly.</i>

06:45.238 --> 06:46.155
<i>I don't mind.</i>

06:50.868 --> 06:51.786
<i>Andy?</i>

06:52.912 --> 06:53.746
<i>Go home.</i>

06:54.455 --> 06:55.331
<i>Please.</i>

06:59.001 --> 06:59.836
<i>I'll, uh…</i>

07:00.795 --> 07:02.713
<i>I'll wait in the cafeteria.</i>

07:05.508 --> 07:07.510
<i>- Text me if you need anything?</i>
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

07:11.180 --> 07:12.932
<i>Hard to lean on 'em, isn't it?</i>

07:15.643 --> 07:17.770
<i>You wouldn't have a pen, would ya?</i>

07:26.237 --> 07:27.071
<i>- Thanks.</i>
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

07:28.948 --> 07:32.493
<i>My son gave me this book.</i>
<i>Has all these questions.</i>

07:32.577 --> 07:34.662
<i>- Hmm.</i>
<i>- "What do you value most?"</i>

07:34.745 --> 07:38.124
<i>"Have those values changed</i>
<i>since your diagnosis?"</i>

07:39.667 --> 07:41.502
<i>Maybe eat dessert first.</i>

07:44.088 --> 07:48.134
<i>"Are there dreams you didn't</i>
<i>allow yourself to have pre-diagnosis?"</i>

07:50.261 --> 07:52.763
<i>Always wanted to take</i>
<i>the grandkids to Disney.</i>

07:53.556 --> 07:54.807
<i>No parents.</i>

07:54.891 --> 07:56.017
<i>Just fun.</i>

07:59.479 --> 08:00.479
<i>What about you?</i>

08:01.147 --> 08:03.274
<i>What wild dreams</i>
<i>have you been putting off?</i>

08:05.776 --> 08:07.111
<i>To finish this book.</i>

08:10.907 --> 08:12.950
<i>Following an FBI raid</i>
<i>this morning,</i>

08:13.034 --> 08:15.661
<i>kidnapped Berkeley Professor</i>
<i>Alexandra Maplecroft</i>

08:15.745 --> 08:17.872
<i>was found near a Bay Area rail yard,</i>

08:17.955 --> 08:19.373
<i>along with the body of a man</i>

08:19.457 --> 08:22.418
<i>believed to be a member</i>
<i>of the Army of the Changing World.</i>

08:22.501 --> 08:25.671
<i>The leftist group kidnapped</i>
<i>the Berkeley academic early last week</i>

08:25.755 --> 08:29.508
<i>shortly before she was due to speak</i>
<i>at the IEF conference in Oslo.</i>

08:30.134 --> 08:32.678
<i>- Another woman posing as Maplecroft…</i>
<i>- Follow that.</i>

08:32.762 --> 08:35.306
<i>…shot billionaire</i>
<i>Martin Queller onstage,</i>

08:35.389 --> 08:37.642
<i>and took her own life moments later.</i>

08:37.725 --> 08:40.061
<i>The woman has been identified</i>
<i>as Grace Juno,</i>

08:40.144 --> 08:41.395
<i>an Oakland resident</i>

08:41.479 --> 08:44.565
<i>who had accused Queller's</i>
<i>pharmaceutical company of corruption.</i>

08:44.649 --> 08:47.276
<i>Juno's husband</i>
<i>killed their three children, as--</i>

08:50.071 --> 08:51.614
<i>All right. We're here.</i>

08:53.574 --> 08:54.408
<i>Now what?</i>

09:00.289 --> 09:02.208
<i>Eli. You're a life-saver.</i>

09:02.291 --> 09:03.834
<i>What happened out there, huh?</i>

09:03.918 --> 09:05.336
<i>- We've been watching the news.</i>
<i>- Hey.</i>

09:05.962 --> 09:07.880
<i>Yeah. Yeah, we were lucky to get out.</i>

09:08.506 --> 09:11.467
<i>Uh, Paula. Jane. This is Clara and Eli.</i>

09:11.550 --> 09:12.593
<i>- Hey.</i>
<i>- Hi.</i>

09:12.677 --> 09:14.387
<i>Uh, we got beds, food, clothes.</i>

09:14.470 --> 09:16.222
<i>- Yeah, whatever you need.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

09:16.305 --> 09:17.431
<i>Hey, where's Andrew?</i>

09:18.140 --> 09:20.685
<i>Uh, he's unpacking.</i>
<i>I'll, uh… I'll give him a hand.</i>

09:22.436 --> 09:25.523
<i>Thank you, guys. Really.</i>
<i>So much. You don't understand.</i>

09:25.606 --> 09:26.649
<i>Yeah.</i>

09:30.987 --> 09:32.029
<i>All right. Got it.</i>

09:34.407 --> 09:37.243
<i>We can hide the supplies in the shed.</i>
<i>All right?</i>

09:39.704 --> 09:41.706
<i>Hey. You okay?</i>

09:43.499 --> 09:44.375
<i>It's all right.</i>

09:45.418 --> 09:46.502
<i>Hey, we're okay.</i>

09:48.963 --> 09:51.424
<i>Yeah. We're okay.</i>

09:52.049 --> 09:53.634
<i>- Oh, shit!</i>

09:54.135 --> 09:55.177
<i>What's wrong?</i>

09:55.886 --> 09:57.138
<i>Shit. Andrew!</i>

09:57.221 --> 09:58.889
<i>I'm good. I'm all right.</i>

09:58.973 --> 09:59.807
<i>Andrew!</i>

09:59.890 --> 10:01.726
<i>He's been shot!</i>
<i>Why didn't you tell?</i>

10:01.809 --> 10:02.852
<i>Had to get out.</i>

10:02.935 --> 10:04.145
<i>We need to get to a hospital.</i>

10:04.228 --> 10:05.563
<i>No, no. We can't go anywhere.</i>

10:05.646 --> 10:08.649
<i>- Eli and I could take you.</i>
<i>- They call cops for a bullet wound.</i>

10:08.733 --> 10:11.068
<i>- We have to do something…</i>

10:11.152 --> 10:12.945
<i>- How bad is it?</i>

10:13.029 --> 10:14.238
<i>Let's get a look.</i>

10:15.906 --> 10:17.533
<i>Sorry I fucked up.</i>

10:17.617 --> 10:20.578
<i>- Hey. Hey. You're fine.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

10:20.661 --> 10:22.121
<i>- All right?</i>
<i>- All right.</i>

10:22.204 --> 10:23.581
<i>Let's get you cleaned up.</i>

10:23.664 --> 10:26.709
<i>There's a pharmacy in Spring River.</i>
<i>I have a friend we can trust.</i>

10:26.792 --> 10:28.711
<i>- You need a doctor!</i>
<i>- Jane!</i>

10:30.713 --> 10:31.881
<i>Will you do as I ask?</i>

10:33.215 --> 10:35.051
<i>I'll be back as soon as I can, okay?</i>

10:36.636 --> 10:37.470
<i>Come inside.</i>

10:42.683 --> 10:44.310
<i>- Okay, all right.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

10:44.393 --> 10:45.311
<i>Almost there.</i>

10:46.520 --> 10:47.480
<i>Yeah.</i>

10:48.648 --> 10:49.565
<i>Yeah.</i>

10:52.943 --> 10:53.778
<i>Okay.</i>

10:55.237 --> 10:56.697
<i>- Thanks.</i>

10:58.741 --> 11:00.701
<i>They checked the location you gave us.</i>

11:01.535 --> 11:04.205
<i>There's no car. No bodies.</i>
<i>There's nothing.</i>

11:04.288 --> 11:05.790
<i>I saw two people get shot.</i>

11:06.540 --> 11:08.542
<i>Well, somebody's covering their tracks.</i>

11:10.294 --> 11:13.381
<i>My billionaire uncle</i>
<i>killing people over a suitcase?</i>

11:13.464 --> 11:15.257
<i>Let's get you out of the Bay Area.</i>

11:15.341 --> 11:16.884
<i>And I'll do some digging.</i>

11:17.551 --> 11:20.346
<i>Michael Vargas has been moved</i>
<i>to a secure location.</i>

11:20.429 --> 11:21.597
<i>How is he?</i>

11:21.680 --> 11:23.766
<i>Stable.</i>
<i>Still don't know what happened.</i>

11:23.849 --> 11:25.142
<i>What about Mom?</i>

11:26.477 --> 11:28.396
<i>No luck tracking her phone.</i>

11:28.479 --> 11:29.772
<i>But they issued a BOLO.</i>

11:32.817 --> 11:33.859
<i>And we'll find her.</i>

11:37.196 --> 11:39.407
<i>Nick is here somewhere.</i>

11:40.699 --> 11:44.328
<i>Your mom wanted you out of</i>
<i>the line of fire. That's why she left.</i>

11:48.207 --> 11:49.709
<i>You think I'm wrong about her.</i>

11:49.792 --> 11:51.210
<i>I don't know what to think.</i>

11:51.293 --> 11:53.963
<i>So we find her.</i>
<i>And we find him.</i>

11:54.046 --> 11:56.006
<i>Then this thing is finally over.</i>

11:58.134 --> 11:58.968
<i>Thank you.</i>

12:00.094 --> 12:01.429
<i>For doing all this.</i>

12:05.141 --> 12:07.935
<i>You know I was with her,</i>
<i>in the delivery room.</i>

12:09.145 --> 12:10.980
<i>I was the second person to hold you.</i>

12:18.696 --> 12:20.531
<i>There is one place she might go.</i>

12:20.614 --> 12:21.449
<i>Where?</i>

12:22.783 --> 12:23.784
<i>Up north.</i>

12:27.121 --> 12:28.414
<i>Old house in the woods.</i>

12:29.206 --> 12:31.333
<i>Soren Sevander used to live there.</i>

12:31.417 --> 12:33.252
<i>Civil rights lawyer and his wife.</i>

12:33.919 --> 12:36.213
<i>Our guys went by there</i>
<i>a couple of days ago.</i>

12:36.881 --> 12:38.507
<i>It might be worth circling back.</i>

12:55.983 --> 12:59.445
<i>The next time</i>
<i>that you feel overwhelmed,</i>

12:59.528 --> 13:03.282
<i>that you feel despair,</i>
<i>that you feel like giving up,</i>

13:03.866 --> 13:06.202
<i>remember this community.</i>

13:16.378 --> 13:18.547
<i>I just can't decide.</i>

13:20.382 --> 13:23.385
<i>The boys would really love</i>
<i>the Polynesian Village,</i>

13:23.469 --> 13:28.808
<i>but my granddaughter's</i>
<i>more a Wilderness Lodge girl.</i>

13:30.309 --> 13:33.312
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>we'll barely be in the hotel, but still.</i>

13:33.395 --> 13:34.396
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

13:34.480 --> 13:35.689
<i>I know.</i>

13:35.773 --> 13:38.150
<i>I just want it to be something</i>
<i>they'll remember.</i>

13:38.234 --> 13:40.277
<i>Something special.</i>

13:42.279 --> 13:46.283
<i>They say the Polynesian Village</i>
<i>has the best view of the fireworks.</i>

13:46.367 --> 13:49.537
<i>Oh, for Christ's sake, will you shut up?</i>

13:49.620 --> 13:53.666
<i>You're not gonna ride Space Mountain</i>
<i>or take selfies with Jiminy Cricket</i>

13:53.749 --> 13:55.292
<i>or see those stupid fireworks,</i>

13:55.376 --> 13:57.586
<i>because you're not going to Disney World.</i>

13:57.670 --> 13:58.546
<i>You're dying!</i>

14:00.506 --> 14:01.841
<i>I'm dying!</i>

14:02.550 --> 14:06.262
<i>That's why we're here,</i>
<i>stuck in these goddamn poison chairs.</i>

14:06.345 --> 14:08.764
<i>So just please stop chattering.</i>

14:08.848 --> 14:10.933
<i>You're giving me a fucking headache.</i>

14:19.525 --> 14:20.401
<i>Leave it.</i>

14:33.998 --> 14:35.040
<i>You were serious.</i>

14:35.749 --> 14:36.584
<i>What?</i>

14:38.043 --> 14:39.878
<i>So you're just waiting to die?</i>

14:40.921 --> 14:42.965
<i>No, I was just trying</i>
<i>to get her to shut up.</i>

14:43.549 --> 14:46.468
<i>You have to keep fighting.</i>
<i>That's the only way this works.</i>

14:46.552 --> 14:47.761
<i>Let's go home. </i>

14:47.845 --> 14:48.679
<i>No.</i>

14:51.807 --> 14:53.642
<i>You're not eating. I've watched you.</i>

14:54.268 --> 14:56.103
<i>I told you, the chemo makes me sick.</i>

14:56.186 --> 14:57.521
<i>Then take your nausea meds</i>

14:57.605 --> 15:00.149
<i>- or drink that tea.</i>
<i>- My God. What do you want from me?</i>

15:00.232 --> 15:02.276
<i>I wanna know why you're not even trying.</i>

15:02.359 --> 15:03.652
<i>Can we please just go home?</i>

15:03.736 --> 15:04.570
<i>Mom!</i>

15:06.196 --> 15:08.824
<i>Well, maybe I didn't think</i>
<i>my life would end up this way.</i>

15:09.992 --> 15:11.493
<i>You mean, stuck alone with me?</i>

15:12.036 --> 15:13.287
<i>No.</i>

15:13.370 --> 15:14.246
<i>Then what?</i>

15:14.330 --> 15:18.834
<i>Contrary to what you may think, my life</i>
<i>didn't begin the moment you were born.</i>

15:18.918 --> 15:20.794
<i>Not everything about me is about you.</i>

15:22.379 --> 15:23.297
<i>I know that.</i>

15:26.050 --> 15:28.385
<i>Sometimes I think</i>
<i>the only reason you came home</i>

15:28.469 --> 15:30.763
<i>is because you didn't have</i>
<i>anything better to do.</i>

15:32.389 --> 15:33.515
<i>What?</i>

15:34.516 --> 15:37.269
<i>One of us needs to get a life.</i>

15:38.854 --> 15:40.481
<i>You can do anything.</i>

15:41.231 --> 15:43.651
<i>You can go anywhere you want.</i>

15:44.234 --> 15:46.779
<i>But you are right here, right here with me</i>

15:46.862 --> 15:49.782
<i>folding my blankets</i>
<i>and going on about adjuvant therapy</i>

15:49.865 --> 15:52.409
<i>and hovering like any of this</i>
<i>fucking matters.</i>

15:53.243 --> 15:54.119
<i>I know.</i>

15:55.788 --> 15:58.499
<i>But I'm… I'm here</i>
<i>and you're not letting me help you.</i>

15:58.582 --> 15:59.750
<i>You can't help me!</i>

15:59.833 --> 16:01.710
<i>Because you're shutting me out!</i>

16:03.879 --> 16:05.714
<i>You know I need you, right?</i>

16:06.966 --> 16:09.802
<i>Even if you're the last person</i>
<i>I wanna talk to most of the time,</i>

16:09.885 --> 16:12.096
<i>I need to know</i>
<i>you're on this planet with me.</i>

16:18.852 --> 16:20.479
<i>They killed my father.</i>

16:20.562 --> 16:22.356
<i>They left an innocent woman to die.</i>

16:22.898 --> 16:24.566
<i>They attacked law enforcement.</i>

16:25.776 --> 16:28.862
<i>The Army of the</i>
<i>Changing World are terrorists.</i>

16:28.946 --> 16:32.616
<i>And I'm going to do everything in my power</i>
<i>to bring these murderers to justice.</i>

16:32.700 --> 16:33.784
<i>Asshole.</i>

16:38.455 --> 16:40.666
<i>Jasper Queller</i>
<i>claiming the moral high ground.</i>

16:40.749 --> 16:43.210
<i>Is that some kind of cosmic fucking joke?</i>

16:46.130 --> 16:48.298
<i>We should bomb that fucker</i>
<i>and his precious company.</i>

16:48.382 --> 16:49.842
<i>You can't do that.</i>

16:56.181 --> 16:57.266
<i>Why not?</i>

17:03.522 --> 17:05.190
<i>It's a revolution, Jane.</i>

17:05.274 --> 17:06.275
<i>Is it?</i>

17:06.358 --> 17:09.737
<i>Or is it just revenge?</i>
<i>Because it's getting harder to tell.</i>

17:32.426 --> 17:33.260
<i>Huh?</i>

17:36.388 --> 17:37.681
<i>You're burning up.</i>

17:39.850 --> 17:41.560
<i>Why didn't you say something?</i>

17:44.188 --> 17:47.524
<i>I'm dying for something</i>
<i>I believe in, Jane.</i>

17:50.736 --> 17:52.654
<i>How many people can say that?</i>

17:55.407 --> 17:56.909
<i>You sound just like him.</i>

17:58.494 --> 17:59.369
<i>Good.</i>

18:11.632 --> 18:13.634
<i>- Let me take you to a hospital.</i>
<i>- No.</i>

18:14.885 --> 18:16.178
<i>It's okay.</i>

18:20.057 --> 18:21.183
<i>You'll be okay.</i>

18:30.692 --> 18:31.985
<i>I'm pregnant.</i>

18:38.575 --> 18:40.160
<i>I hope it's a girl.</i>

18:41.745 --> 18:43.831
<i>That'll be perfect karma.</i>

18:48.001 --> 18:49.711
<i>I need you here.</i>

18:52.422 --> 18:53.507
<i>I can't be alone.</i>

18:57.302 --> 18:58.428
<i>You won't be.</i>

19:08.647 --> 19:09.940
<i>You won't be.</i>

19:57.404 --> 20:00.240
<i>This is insane.</i>
<i>We can't pull it off.</i>

20:00.324 --> 20:03.160
<i>You'll take over the company,</i>
<i>the responsible son.</i>

20:04.036 --> 20:06.788
<i>Jasper, I'm telling you,</i>
<i>the board won't even blink.</i>

20:15.172 --> 20:16.590
<i>What are you doing?</i>

20:17.216 --> 20:19.176
<i>I'm taking Andrew to the hospital.</i>

20:19.259 --> 20:20.344
<i>No. Jane.</i>

20:20.427 --> 20:22.179
<i>He won't make it through the night.</i>

20:23.764 --> 20:24.598
<i>I know.</i>

20:26.099 --> 20:29.436
<i>So you're just…</i>
<i>okay with letting him die?</i>

20:29.519 --> 20:33.398
<i>Look, it's too late. It's too late.</i>
<i>Every cop in the country's looking for us.</i>

20:33.482 --> 20:36.985
<i>I don't fucking care.</i>

20:37.069 --> 20:39.363
<i>Do you think I wanted</i>
<i>any of this to happen?</i>

20:41.406 --> 20:42.366
<i>But it did.</i>

20:43.408 --> 20:46.578
<i>And now it's you and me.</i>
<i>But we have to find a way forward.</i>

20:48.372 --> 20:50.540
<i>Now look, we've never been whole people.</i>

20:50.624 --> 20:51.833
<i>The world broke us.</i>

20:52.584 --> 20:54.044
<i>But we found each other.</i>

20:55.003 --> 20:57.547
<i>But we only make sense together,</i>
<i>you know that.</i>

21:01.260 --> 21:03.720
<i>I can't! I can't do this.</i>

21:03.804 --> 21:05.389
<i>No, listen to me. Listen to me!</i>

21:05.472 --> 21:06.848
<i>Eli will take us to the border.</i>

21:06.932 --> 21:08.725
<i>He has friends in Calgary.</i>
<i>They can help us.</i>

21:08.809 --> 21:10.686
<i>- No.</i>
<i>- Jane.</i>

21:21.405 --> 21:25.117
<i>- Please. Please stop.</i>
<i>- If you ever leave me,</i>

21:25.867 --> 21:28.829
<i>I would scorch the earth to find you.</i>

21:29.997 --> 21:30.831
<i>Please.</i>

21:30.914 --> 21:31.999
<i>Do you understand?</i>

21:33.125 --> 21:33.959
<i>No.</i>

21:52.102 --> 21:53.979
<i>Little miss sunshine's late today.</i>

21:54.521 --> 21:56.440
<i>Where is she? Out buying lottery tickets?</i>

21:56.523 --> 21:58.567
<i>Gloria was moved to hospice care.</i>

22:37.147 --> 22:39.483
<i>You were always so goddamn cheerful.</i>

22:45.072 --> 22:46.031
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

22:55.791 --> 22:57.334
<i>You asked me, um,</i>

22:58.960 --> 23:00.712
<i>about the dreams I have.</i>

23:03.840 --> 23:04.925
<i>It's only one.</i>

23:08.345 --> 23:09.221
<i>Freedom.</i>

23:12.682 --> 23:14.768
<i>See, I was raised to be a good girl.</i>

23:16.561 --> 23:19.314
<i>Trained to please to…</i>

23:20.690 --> 23:23.151
<i>keep the peace when bad things happened.</i>

23:28.073 --> 23:29.574
<i>But I was drowning.</i>

23:41.670 --> 23:44.506
<i>I saw a way out.</i>

23:48.927 --> 23:51.513
<i>Well, I thought I did,</i>
<i>but it was just a dead end.</i>

23:54.850 --> 23:56.476
<i>This man I loved…</i>

23:57.519 --> 23:59.020
<i>He tried to kill me.</i>

24:06.695 --> 24:08.363
<i>And I had to get away.</i>

24:11.616 --> 24:14.119
<i>So I became another person.</i>

24:16.872 --> 24:19.499
<i>And I locked that old self away.</i>

24:32.679 --> 24:34.973
<i>I told myself it was my choice.</i>

24:37.976 --> 24:43.190
<i>The only way to survive, to keep us safe.</i>

24:48.236 --> 24:49.446
<i>But hiding</i>

24:51.198 --> 24:53.116
<i>for 30 years.</i>

24:55.827 --> 24:57.370
<i>That's not choice.</i>

24:59.539 --> 25:00.999
<i>It's captivity.</i>

25:03.293 --> 25:07.464
<i>Lie, after lie, after lie.</i>

25:11.218 --> 25:12.344
<i>And Andy feels it.</i>

25:12.427 --> 25:15.388
<i>I mean, she might not know what it is,</i>
<i>but she feels it.</i>

25:20.769 --> 25:22.354
<i>Smothering her.</i>

25:43.667 --> 25:45.377
<i>This is not my life.</i>

25:52.551 --> 25:53.843
<i>I need a way out.</i>

26:00.892 --> 26:01.977
<i>I can't</i>

26:03.478 --> 26:06.523
<i>die in someone else's skin.</i>

26:58.033 --> 26:58.950
<i>Jane.</i>

26:59.659 --> 27:00.660
<i>He's gone.</i>

27:03.830 --> 27:05.165
<i>I came as fast as I could.</i>

27:05.707 --> 27:08.335
<i>He never woke up. I didn't get to say bye.</i>

27:10.170 --> 27:11.171
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

27:15.592 --> 27:17.218
<i>Oh, Jesus, what happened?</i>

27:17.802 --> 27:18.803
<i>What?</i>

27:23.099 --> 27:24.643
<i>We don't have a lot of time.</i>

27:25.226 --> 27:26.978
<i>There's an FBI agent out there.</i>

27:27.854 --> 27:29.606
<i>Tell them it was Nick and Andrew.</i>

27:30.357 --> 27:32.650
<i>Tell them they brainwashed you.</i>

27:33.360 --> 27:35.403
<i>- That they beat you--</i>
<i>- Stop. Just stop.</i>

27:35.487 --> 27:36.529
<i>I'm trying to help.</i>

27:36.613 --> 27:39.616
<i>You are the second person today</i>
<i>to ask me to abandon Andrew.</i>

27:41.242 --> 27:42.327
<i>He's dead, Jane.</i>

27:43.495 --> 27:45.622
<i>There's nothing we can do to change that.</i>

27:45.705 --> 27:47.290
<i>But this, we can deal with.</i>

27:48.208 --> 27:51.211
<i>We just need to get ahead of it.</i>

27:51.294 --> 27:52.337
<i>Get ahead of it?</i>

27:52.420 --> 27:53.630
<i>I'm being practical.</i>

27:53.713 --> 27:56.758
<i>You sound like Martin.</i>
<i>You want to blame someone else? </i>

27:56.841 --> 27:58.843
<i>No. No, Jane. This is on you and Andrew.</i>

27:59.386 --> 28:01.304
<i>You fell for that fucking con man.</i>

28:01.388 --> 28:03.807
<i>I warned you, and now I'm here</i>
<i>to clean up your mess.</i>

28:03.890 --> 28:05.517
<i>- Bullshit.</i>

28:10.021 --> 28:12.023
<i>This is what is going to happen.</i>

28:14.567 --> 28:19.280
<i>I will turn myself in,</i>
<i>do my time, get on with my life.</i>

28:20.698 --> 28:24.703
<i>Neither of us will say a word about Andrew</i>
<i>and what he did or didn't do.</i>

28:26.121 --> 28:27.497
<i>You can have the company.</i>

28:27.580 --> 28:31.167
<i>But you'll use the profits from the</i>
<i>pharmaceutical division to make amends.</i>

28:31.251 --> 28:32.627
<i>If you think I'm gonna listen--</i>

28:32.711 --> 28:35.922
<i>If that doesn't happen,</i>
<i>if I hear you're still exploiting people</i>

28:36.005 --> 28:38.675
<i>or if there is one whisper</i>
<i>that Andrew was to blame,</i>

28:38.758 --> 28:40.593
<i>I will ruin your fucking life.</i>

28:52.021 --> 28:53.148
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

28:55.066 --> 28:56.693
<i>I know all about Oslo.</i>

28:57.318 --> 28:58.486
<i>What?</i>

28:58.570 --> 29:00.822
<i>- You and Nick, and your side deal.</i>

29:02.115 --> 29:03.992
<i>I have no idea what you're talking about.</i>

29:04.993 --> 29:06.202
<i>It's all on tape.</i>

29:11.124 --> 29:13.084
<i>In a very safe place.</i>

29:17.797 --> 29:19.591
<i>Okay. Okay, um…</i>

29:22.218 --> 29:24.179
<i>I had no idea Nick was gonna kill him.</i>

29:24.763 --> 29:26.222
<i>Try telling him that.</i>

29:35.690 --> 29:38.151
<i>Please, we have to look out</i>
<i>for each other.</i>

29:38.735 --> 29:40.653
<i>We're the only ones left.</i>

29:42.322 --> 29:44.449
<i>It's just you and me now.</i>

29:44.532 --> 29:48.244
<i>- It was never you and me.</i>
<i>- Just… Jane, please. Jane, just…</i>

29:52.415 --> 29:55.877
<i>I know who killed Alex Maplecroft,</i>
<i>and I know where you can find him.</i>

29:56.544 --> 29:57.378
<i>I'm listening.</i>

30:02.967 --> 30:04.302
<i>I want a deal first.</i>

30:20.151 --> 30:24.572
<i>If Mom gave Nick up to the feds,</i>
<i>why didn't they catch him the first time?</i>

30:26.407 --> 30:28.827
<i>I got real close, but he slipped away.</i>

30:29.452 --> 30:30.662
<i>I think he had help.</i>

30:34.207 --> 30:36.209
<i>He's been out there 30 years.</i>

30:36.292 --> 30:39.879
<i>Why come back?</i>
<i>Does he really hate Mom that much?</i>

30:41.798 --> 30:43.716
<i>People have long memories.</i>

30:43.800 --> 30:46.594
<i>You're on your own, you brood on the past.</i>

30:46.678 --> 30:50.431
<i>That feeling connects you</i>
<i>to something, you hold on to it.</i>

30:55.979 --> 30:57.480
<i>That Polaroid I showed you.</i>

30:58.523 --> 30:59.649
<i>Mom beaten up.</i>

31:01.609 --> 31:02.944
<i>You knew Nick did that.</i>

31:03.528 --> 31:04.696
<i>Of course, I did.</i>

31:05.738 --> 31:07.073
<i>I took the damn picture.</i>

31:08.616 --> 31:09.617
<i>Charlie!</i>

33:21.833 --> 33:24.711
<i>Hey, Andy. You feeling any better?</i>

33:27.630 --> 33:29.966
<i>Fever's gone,</i>
<i>but there's only one way to tell.</i>

33:32.802 --> 33:35.138
<i>Yeah. You're feeling better.</i>

33:36.139 --> 33:36.973
<i>Come on.</i>

33:39.809 --> 33:41.769
<i>Did you say good morning to your mommy?</i>

33:48.985 --> 33:50.361
<i>Good morning, Mommy.</i>

33:55.158 --> 33:56.242
<i>Okay.</i>

33:56.325 --> 33:58.077
<i>Can I go outside?</i>

33:58.161 --> 33:59.328
<i>Yeah! Let's go.</i>

34:27.482 --> 34:29.484
<i>Remember! Don't go past the big tree.</i>

35:08.189 --> 35:14.570
<i>…two, three, four, five, six.</i>

35:14.654 --> 35:21.118
<i>One, two, three, four, five… Ooh.</i>

35:21.202 --> 35:22.036
<i>Five.</i>

35:23.746 --> 35:26.207
<i>And one in the middle.</i>

35:28.376 --> 35:29.252
<i>The sunflower.</i>

35:38.427 --> 35:40.555
<i>When is Eli coming home?</i>

35:41.764 --> 35:44.433
<i>Maybe tomorrow.</i>
<i>The jury's still making up its mind.</i>

35:51.774 --> 35:53.442
<i>It's just a fox.</i>

35:53.526 --> 35:56.028
<i>Hey. Go get your PJs on.</i>

35:59.991 --> 36:00.908
<i>Go on.</i>

37:47.640 --> 37:48.516
<i>Hey!</i>

37:52.478 --> 37:53.854
<i>Hey, I saved them for you.</i>

37:54.480 --> 37:55.815
<i>A monster was going to eat them.</i>

37:57.900 --> 38:01.445
<i>Uh, this one fell into a lava pit,</i>
<i>so I, uh… I fixed her up.</i>

38:01.529 --> 38:02.488
<i>What do you think?</i>

38:03.114 --> 38:04.740
<i>- Good.</i>
<i>- Yeah?</i>

38:09.120 --> 38:11.330
<i>You have the whole</i>
<i>magic forest to yourself?</i>

38:11.414 --> 38:12.248
<i>Yes.</i>

38:13.749 --> 38:15.376
<i>Well, that's pretty cool.</i>

38:19.046 --> 38:19.922
<i>Where's your mom?</i>

38:20.965 --> 38:21.799
<i>Gone.</i>

38:25.845 --> 38:28.264
<i>Do you mean she's in heaven?</i>

38:28.889 --> 38:31.308
<i>She grows flowers.</i>

38:34.562 --> 38:35.938
<i>And where does she do that?</i>

38:36.022 --> 38:38.024
<i>Mm-mm. I don't know.</i>

38:44.113 --> 38:45.114
<i>What's your name?</i>

38:45.197 --> 38:46.157
<i>Andy.</i>

38:47.158 --> 38:47.992
<i>Andy?</i>

38:51.078 --> 38:52.913
<i>Yeah, I had a friend with that name.</i>

38:59.003 --> 39:02.006
<i>Hey. We can all go swimming.</i>
<i>Do you want to see the creek?</i>

39:02.089 --> 39:03.341
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- Yeah?</i>

39:03.924 --> 39:05.301
<i>All right, come on.</i>

39:05.384 --> 39:06.302
<i>It'll be fun.</i>

39:16.187 --> 39:17.021
<i>Andy!</i>

39:20.941 --> 39:22.151
<i>Andy!</i>

39:24.487 --> 39:27.490
<i>Sweetie, it's time to come in!</i>
<i>Eli's home!</i>

39:29.909 --> 39:31.911
<i>Andy! Where are you?</i>

39:33.621 --> 39:34.747
<i>Andy!</i>

39:35.456 --> 39:36.916
<i>Andy! Where are you, sweetie?</i>

39:38.084 --> 39:39.543
<i>I have to go.</i>

39:41.295 --> 39:44.215
<i>This is our secret, okay?</i>
<i>I'm your imaginary friend.</i>

39:44.924 --> 39:46.300
<i>Sweetie, come in!</i>

39:48.052 --> 39:49.178
<i>Andy!</i>

39:51.722 --> 39:53.307
<i>As long as you have this…</i>

39:55.518 --> 39:57.144
<i>that means I'll come back.</i>

39:58.395 --> 39:59.355
<i>Can you remember that?</i>

<i>I thought we could plant</i>
<i>some at our new house.</i>

43:45.664 --> 43:47.207
<i>We talked about this.</i>

43:47.291 --> 43:49.376
<i>You're going with your mommy</i>

43:51.879 --> 43:53.422
<i>I wanna stay with you.</i>

43:53.505 --> 43:54.715
<i>No, sweetie.</i>

43:55.257 --> 43:57.343
<i>I have to look after the woods, remember?</i>

43:57.426 --> 44:00.095
<i>- Okay. Come here.</i>

44:26.330 --> 44:27.164
<i>Hey.</i>

44:32.961 --> 44:35.047
<i>I don't know how I can repay you.</i>

44:35.589 --> 44:36.507
<i>You did.</i>

44:37.800 --> 44:39.551
<i>Something good came out of all of this.</i>

44:42.054 --> 44:43.889
<i>I won't be able to visit, will I?</i>

44:44.473 --> 44:47.017
<i>No. I don't think so.</i>

44:48.519 --> 44:50.521
<i>It's all there, just like you wanted.</i>

44:50.604 --> 44:52.439
<i>We put some of Andy's stuff on top.</i>

44:52.523 --> 44:53.524
<i>Thank you.</i>

44:56.193 --> 44:57.403
<i>I guess we should go.</i>

45:00.447 --> 45:01.281
<i>No.</i>

45:04.243 --> 45:05.452

46:07.306 --> 46:08.140
<i>Ugh.</i>

46:09.683 --> 46:12.269

46:22.362 --> 46:23.947
<i>You're okay. Hey, hey, hey.</i>

46:25.115 --> 46:26.783
<i>I don't want to go.</i>

46:28.160 --> 46:29.328
<i>You're okay.</i>

46:31.663 --> 46:32.498
<i>Okay.</i>

47:39.273 --> 47:41.608
<i>Don't worry,</i>
<i>I'll go take a look at it.</i>

47:58.083 --> 47:59.501
<i>Are you hungry?</i>

48:01.295 --> 48:02.588
<i>You want a snack?</i>

48:07.050 --> 48:08.343
<i>What do you have there?</i>

48:11.179 --> 48:12.097
<i>Can I see it?</i>

48:16.143 --> 48:18.520
<i>Pretty please, with a cherry on top?</i>

48:35.162 --> 48:36.663
<i>I know you're scared.</i>

48:37.706 --> 48:38.582
<i>Me, too.</i>

48:41.001 --> 48:42.628
<i>We have to figure this out.</i>

48:44.713 --> 48:45.964
<i>We have to be a team.</i>

49:17.162 --> 49:18.497
<i>Where did you get this?</i>

49:23.627 --> 49:25.253
<i>Where did you get this?</i>

49:26.380 --> 49:27.714
<i>Who gave you this?</i>

50:28.316 --> 50:30.027
<i>Oh, you slept all day.</i>

50:31.361 --> 50:32.529
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

50:33.655 --> 50:35.157
<i>Uh, who are you?</i>

<i>Nick Harp.</i>

50:38.160 --> 50:39.077
<i>Your father.</i>
