WEBVTT

00:07.442 --> 00:08.617
Ooh, luggage.

00:08.660 --> 00:10.488
Do I detect a voyage
of some kind?

00:10.532 --> 00:12.055
Nothing gets by you, man.

00:12.099 --> 00:13.317
Oh, we're going away
for the weekend.

00:13.361 --> 00:15.276
Everything's been so crazy
since moving here,

00:15.319 --> 00:17.017
but we finally got
a second to breathe,

00:17.060 --> 00:19.019
so I'm going to Ohio

00:19.062 --> 00:20.716
to see if my dead mom
is a ghost.

00:20.759 --> 00:22.500
Not exactly spring break
in Ibiza.

00:22.544 --> 00:23.893
How did she die,
if you don't mind me asking?

00:23.936 --> 00:25.155
Allergic reaction.

00:25.199 --> 00:27.157
She was at a restaurant
and didn't realize

00:27.201 --> 00:28.550
the dish she ordered
had shrimp in it.

00:28.593 --> 00:31.118
Ah. I had a pretty severe
shellfish allergy myself,

00:31.161 --> 00:32.815
which is why
I always carried an EpiPen.

00:32.858 --> 00:34.338
Of course, those don't protect
you against everything.

00:35.513 --> 00:36.688
We're sorry about your mom, Sam.

00:36.732 --> 00:37.994
Thank you.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.301
It was six years ago.
Honestly, I'm excited.

00:40.344 --> 00:42.042
I never got a chance
to say goodbye,

00:42.085 --> 00:44.261
and now I might get to see her,
so that's amazing.

00:44.305 --> 00:47.003
Okay, but remember to
keep your wits about you

00:47.047 --> 00:48.178
amongst those buckeyes.

00:48.222 --> 00:50.354
Rutherford B. Hayes
was from Ohio, so...

00:50.398 --> 00:51.442
You get it.

00:51.486 --> 00:53.314
Okay. I've got to pack.

00:53.357 --> 00:55.664
And just as a reminder, Sam,
your mother might not be there.

00:55.707 --> 00:57.231
Not every spirit
is lucky enough

00:57.274 --> 01:00.103
to be trapped in an
- endless purgatory.
I know.

01:00.147 --> 01:01.800
But I just got to see, right?

01:01.844 --> 01:02.801
Well, we're all here
to support you.

01:02.845 --> 01:03.846
Thank you.

01:03.889 --> 01:05.108
And also to remind you

01:05.152 --> 01:07.415
to leave the TV on
when you go.

01:08.546 --> 01:09.895
Maybe write down
the thing about leaving

01:09.939 --> 01:11.114
the TV on?

01:11.158 --> 01:12.333
Sam?

01:18.904 --> 01:20.080
Knock, knock.

01:20.123 --> 01:21.385
Uh,

01:21.429 --> 01:23.344
can I ask your advice on
something before you go?

01:23.387 --> 01:24.736
Sure. Pete just came in.

01:24.780 --> 01:26.216
Hey, what up, Arrow Guy?

01:26.260 --> 01:28.784
So, you can probably tell
I have a crush on Alberta,

01:28.827 --> 01:30.046
right?

01:30.090 --> 01:31.395
I think I want
to say something to her.

01:31.439 --> 01:32.875
Wow.

01:32.918 --> 01:35.051
Pete has a crush on Alberta,
and he wants to tell her.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.575
Okay, so we're looping Jay in
- on this one.
Wait,

01:37.619 --> 01:38.924
hasn't he known her
for decades?

01:38.968 --> 01:40.752
Why is he making
the move now?
Well,

01:40.796 --> 01:43.059
I'm a loyal guy, and my wife
was still very much alive.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.279
But then you asked her
to come visit the house,

01:45.322 --> 01:47.237
and I found out she was
a dirty, lying cheater.

01:47.281 --> 01:49.718
So, long story short,
I'm ready to move on.

01:49.761 --> 01:51.198
He's just ready to move on.

01:51.241 --> 01:53.548
Cool. Look, I got
to take these down,

01:53.591 --> 01:56.377
but please catch me up
in the car, okay?

01:56.420 --> 01:57.987
'Cause I actually kind of love
this stuff.

01:58.030 --> 01:59.249
It's like watching <i>Friends,</i>

01:59.293 --> 02:01.033
except you can't see
or hear <i>Friends,</i>

02:01.077 --> 02:02.470
and you only have one person

02:02.513 --> 02:04.341
to tell you
what it's about.

02:04.385 --> 02:05.908
So, wh-what do you think?

02:05.951 --> 02:08.258
I love that you came to me,

02:08.302 --> 02:09.999
but I have one foot
out the door right now.

02:10.042 --> 02:11.783
Just tell me what to do.
Sh-Should I say something?

02:11.827 --> 02:13.698
Pete, you're a sweet guy.

02:13.742 --> 02:16.179
But I've only heard her talk
about dating bootleggers

02:16.223 --> 02:17.354
or mob bosses.

02:17.398 --> 02:18.747
Oh, you don't think
I'm a bad boy?

02:18.790 --> 02:21.097
You know, I ripped the tag
off a mattress one time.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.794
That's a federal offense, baby.

02:22.838 --> 02:25.319
I just would hate
to see you get hurt,

02:25.362 --> 02:28.191
and if, for any reason,
things went poorly,

02:28.235 --> 02:30.889
- it could be awkward.
- Right.

02:30.933 --> 02:32.848
- Like, for everyone.
- Sure.

02:32.891 --> 02:34.371
- For all eternity.
- Yeah.

02:34.415 --> 02:35.677
Feels like you're
kind of harping on it now.

02:39.985 --> 02:42.249
Oh. Hey, the TV, Sam?

02:42.292 --> 02:43.728
- One last reminder?
- Yeah.

02:43.772 --> 02:46.731
Wow. Can't believe Pete
is gonna tell Alberta

02:46.775 --> 02:49.038
- he's got a crush on her.
- What now?

02:49.081 --> 02:50.213
Uh...

02:50.257 --> 02:52.215
I'm rooting for Arrow Guy.

02:52.259 --> 02:53.477
Please don't say anything.

02:53.521 --> 02:55.349
I think I talked him
out of it, anyway.

02:55.392 --> 02:57.307
What if I really want
to say something, though?

02:57.351 --> 02:58.482
Please don't.

02:58.526 --> 02:59.788
Let's go, babe!

03:02.573 --> 03:04.227
Seriously, Sass.

03:04.271 --> 03:07.274
I promise
I'll try not to say anything!

03:07.317 --> 03:10.190
But this is a tasty morsel!

03:15.282 --> 03:17.806
Are you ready? How you feeling?

03:17.849 --> 03:19.938
Nervous. I haven't seen her
in six years.

03:19.982 --> 03:21.984
And I know it sounds dumb,
but I just...

03:22.027 --> 03:23.681
I kind of want her
to be proud of me.

03:23.725 --> 03:25.074
That doesn't
sound dumb at all.

03:25.117 --> 03:26.554
Well, of course
you don't think so.

03:26.597 --> 03:27.859
You still call your mom
when you finish your crossword.

03:27.903 --> 03:30.253
It was a Saturday one,
and I did it in ink.

03:30.297 --> 03:31.776
But the last time
I saw my mom

03:31.820 --> 03:33.517
was when I'd gone home
for Thanksgiving.

03:33.561 --> 03:35.780
We got into this huge fight
because she told me

03:35.824 --> 03:37.913
I should give up journalism
and apply to law school.

03:37.956 --> 03:40.263
Yeah, but what did you
do? You stuck with it.

03:40.307 --> 03:42.178
Well, I'm doing fine,
but it's not like I'm writing

03:42.222 --> 03:43.788
for <i>The New York Times</i>
or anything.

03:43.832 --> 03:45.355
Babe, you're doing amazing.

03:45.399 --> 03:46.661
And it's not just the writing.

03:46.704 --> 03:48.445
You nabbed yourself a good hubs.

03:48.489 --> 03:50.055
We're starting this B and B.

03:50.099 --> 03:54.103
And you're possibly the only
person on the planet who can

03:54.146 --> 03:55.713
see ghosts.

03:55.757 --> 03:57.237
You're practically a superhero.

03:57.280 --> 04:01.371
I guess I am
- kind of a superhero, right?
- Uh-huh.

04:01.415 --> 04:03.025
And that means I'm doing it
with a superhero,

04:03.068 --> 04:05.157
which, as you know,
is, like, a big dream of mine.

04:05.201 --> 04:07.029
That took
a really weird turn.

04:07.072 --> 04:09.423
Yeah, you're not wrong.
But it's still hot.

04:09.466 --> 04:12.208
Troops, we have a situation.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.558
It seems that Samantha
remembered to leave the TV on,

04:14.602 --> 04:16.691
but by some cruel twist
of fate,

04:16.734 --> 04:18.997
it has turned off
by itself.

04:19.041 --> 04:21.478
Sleep mode.

04:21.522 --> 04:23.001
I'm sorry, what?

04:23.045 --> 04:24.960
If no one press button
for six hours,

04:25.003 --> 04:26.875
TV go asleep.

04:26.918 --> 04:28.311
Well, can't you turn it on,
Trevor?

04:28.355 --> 04:30.444
Jay put the remote away.

04:30.487 --> 04:33.185
I mean, a button I can do,
but a handle on a drawer?

04:33.229 --> 04:34.448
I-I'm only human.

04:34.491 --> 04:36.058
Or whatever this is.

04:36.101 --> 04:37.712
But what are we supposed
to do for entertainment?

04:37.755 --> 04:39.322
She'll be gone for days.

04:39.366 --> 04:40.758
Guys, guys, come on.

04:40.802 --> 04:43.065
Before Jay and Sam,
we used to entertain ourselves,

04:43.108 --> 04:45.459
remember?
Food Club, Movie Club.

04:45.502 --> 04:46.808
We'd talk for hours.

04:46.851 --> 04:48.418
Who wants to hear me
describe <i>Meatballs?</i>

04:48.462 --> 04:50.594
Now,
that's actually a food

04:50.638 --> 04:52.640
- <i>and</i> a movie.
- This is hell. I'm in hell.

04:52.683 --> 04:54.032
The movie stars Bill Murray

04:54.076 --> 04:56.426
as a fun-loving,
wisecracking counselor

04:56.470 --> 04:58.167
at a summer camp.
And the food...

04:58.210 --> 04:59.473
well, you guys know
what the food is.

04:59.516 --> 05:00.604
Pretty self-explanatory.

05:00.648 --> 05:02.084
But we got the time,
so I'll explain it.

05:02.127 --> 05:04.216
Pete's planning on telling
Alberta that he likes her.

05:04.260 --> 05:06.001
- What?
- What?

05:06.044 --> 05:07.916
I'm sorry, Pete.
But I overheard Jay,

05:07.959 --> 05:09.004
and I didn't want
to say anything,

05:09.047 --> 05:10.658
and then the TV shut off,

05:10.701 --> 05:12.442
and then you forced my hand with
this whole meatballs lecture.

05:12.486 --> 05:13.965
I...Maybe we should go talk
about this

05:14.009 --> 05:15.140
in the other room, Pete.

05:15.184 --> 05:17.404
Although if it's
good news for Pete,

05:17.447 --> 05:21.451
perhaps we should all be a part
of it to celebrate together.

05:23.366 --> 05:25.934
- Yeah, maybe the other room?
- Oy.

05:25.977 --> 05:26.935
Uh-oh.

05:26.978 --> 05:28.589
Maybe you heard
Jay wrong, Sass.

05:28.632 --> 05:30.068
I mean, I don't think so.

05:30.112 --> 05:31.374
Or maybe Jay was
a little mixed-up.

05:31.418 --> 05:32.549
You know how you say
one thing to Sam,

05:32.593 --> 05:33.550
she repeats it to Jay,

05:33.594 --> 05:35.117
and then
it's the telephone game.

05:35.160 --> 05:36.901
Well, what <i>did</i>
you say to Sam?

05:36.945 --> 05:40.078
Well, I did tell her
that I had feelings for someone,

05:40.122 --> 05:42.385
but that someone was...

05:42.429 --> 05:45.170
my girlfriend.

05:45.214 --> 05:46.389
Oh!

05:46.433 --> 05:48.086
Girlfriend? What,
you got a girlfriend?

05:48.130 --> 05:50.393
One of you mating with Pete?

05:50.437 --> 05:52.047
I don't think so.
Certainly not.

05:52.090 --> 05:54.049
Well, a-actually, I don't...
I don't think you guys know her.

05:54.092 --> 05:55.529
How would we not know her?

05:55.572 --> 05:58.836
Because she...
lives downstairs.

05:58.880 --> 06:00.360
In the cholera pit?

06:00.403 --> 06:01.578
Uh, yeah.

06:01.622 --> 06:02.840
The cholera pit.

06:02.884 --> 06:05.626
Well, I, for one,
would love to meet her.

06:05.669 --> 06:06.757
Well, I'll go

06:06.801 --> 06:08.019
talk to her about it
right now.

06:08.063 --> 06:11.240
Downstairs,
where she definitely lives.

06:11.283 --> 06:13.677
Here I go.

06:13.721 --> 06:15.679
Be back with my girlfriend.

06:15.723 --> 06:17.942
Oh, God.

06:19.640 --> 06:23.383
Okay, mojitos are Cuban,
this menu is Mexican,

06:23.426 --> 06:25.515
and then the cheeseburger
on the wall's playing a ukulele,

06:25.559 --> 06:28.692
which is definitely Hawaiian.
This place is all over the map.

06:28.736 --> 06:30.825
Welcome to Mojitown. I'm Dennis.

06:30.868 --> 06:32.479
Will it be two for lunch?

06:32.522 --> 06:34.655
- Yes, thank you.
- I still don't see her.

06:34.698 --> 06:36.265
- Who?
- Oh, uh,

06:36.308 --> 06:37.614
my mom. She's
meeting us here.

06:37.658 --> 06:39.660
- So it'll be three for lunch.
- No, no,

06:39.703 --> 06:41.401
'cause she's probably
- not eating with us.
- I'm sorry,

06:41.444 --> 06:42.880
I'm confused.

06:43.925 --> 06:45.970
Holy crap, Samantha?

06:46.014 --> 06:47.363
Mom?

06:47.407 --> 06:48.408
"Mom"?

06:48.451 --> 06:49.757
You can see me?

06:49.800 --> 06:51.976
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God!

06:52.020 --> 06:53.108
Oh, my God!

06:54.457 --> 06:55.719
She loves

06:55.763 --> 06:58.983
Cuban-themed
Mexican Hawaiian restaurants.

06:59.027 --> 07:00.985
They're so hard to find.

07:05.903 --> 07:08.340
"Come join us at Mojitown,"
my coworkers said.

07:08.384 --> 07:10.647
"One lunch won't kill you."
Oh, yeah?

07:10.691 --> 07:13.476
Well, are there at least
other ghosts for you to talk to?

07:13.520 --> 07:15.739
Yeah, a couple. There's Sondra.

07:15.783 --> 07:17.045
Ooh,

07:17.088 --> 07:18.481
what's a cheese hurricane?

07:18.525 --> 07:20.178
It's what made my heart explode.

07:20.222 --> 07:21.658
Might have to get that.

07:21.702 --> 07:24.748
Oh.
And, of course, there's Peggy Sue. She was

07:24.792 --> 07:27.359
a carhop when this place was
a drive-in diner in the '50s.

07:27.403 --> 07:30.188
Roller skates and tail fins,
not a great combo.

07:30.232 --> 07:31.929
So,

07:31.973 --> 07:33.322
how did this happen?

07:33.365 --> 07:34.628
You said
that one of the ghosts

07:34.671 --> 07:36.499
from the mansion
pushed you down the stairs?

07:36.543 --> 07:39.981
Oh, no, no. Uh, he has a power
where he can touch things,

07:40.024 --> 07:41.809
and he knocked over a vase.
I tripped.

07:41.852 --> 07:43.767
- It was a total accident.
- He doesn't wear pants.

07:43.811 --> 07:45.247
He can touch things?

07:45.290 --> 07:46.640
My ghost power sucks.

07:46.683 --> 07:47.728
What's your ghost power?

07:47.771 --> 07:49.164
I can burp up shrimp breath.

07:53.995 --> 07:55.518
What the hell was that?

07:55.562 --> 07:57.041
My late mother.

07:57.085 --> 08:00.305
Okay, so,
you're doing the B and B.

08:00.349 --> 08:01.437
I guess that means
it didn't work out

08:01.481 --> 08:02.960
with the whole journalism thing.

08:03.004 --> 08:05.920
No, it worked out. I'm just...
I'm also doing the B and B

08:05.963 --> 08:07.835
in addition to the
journalism thing.

08:07.878 --> 08:10.533
Sam had a big article published

08:10.577 --> 08:12.448
in the <i>Ulster County Review.</i>

08:12.492 --> 08:14.145
Oh, that's nice.

08:14.189 --> 08:17.235
- So, you're on staff there?
- No, I am freelance.

08:17.279 --> 08:18.759
Oh.

08:18.802 --> 08:21.370
Yeah. But then this guy

08:21.413 --> 08:23.024
who works at <i>The New York Times</i>
read it,

08:23.067 --> 08:26.244
- and he asked me to work there.
- What?

08:26.288 --> 08:27.419
Huh?
Yes.

08:27.463 --> 08:28.812
So, that is your daughter.

08:28.856 --> 08:31.336
Full-time at <i>the</i>
paper of record.

08:31.380 --> 08:32.686
This is incredible.

08:32.729 --> 08:34.209
I mean,

08:34.252 --> 08:36.080
a staff writer
at <i>The New York Times.</i>

08:36.124 --> 08:37.473
Well, I guess

08:37.517 --> 08:39.040
you're going to have to give up
the B and B, then.

08:39.083 --> 08:42.565
No, I can still work remotely.
Send in articles.

08:42.609 --> 08:44.480
Wait, but you're never
gonna make it to editor

08:44.524 --> 08:47.048
if you just send in
the articles.

08:47.091 --> 08:49.137
- Here we go.
- No, I'm just saying

08:49.180 --> 08:50.921
that that's where all
the networking happens, right?

08:50.965 --> 08:52.923
Not even my lies are
good enough for you.

08:52.967 --> 08:55.883
- Your lies?
- Yes. I don't work for <i>The New York Times.</i>

08:55.926 --> 08:57.493
I just said that
because I wanted you

08:57.537 --> 08:59.321
to admit you were wrong about
the whole journalism thing.

08:59.364 --> 09:01.410
But apparently
nothing I ever do

09:01.453 --> 09:02.759
will be good enough
for you, Mom.

09:02.803 --> 09:04.456
Uh, she calls me Mom.

09:04.500 --> 09:07.068
It's like "bro."
It's a TikTok thing.

09:07.111 --> 09:09.070
Bye, Mom.

09:09.113 --> 09:10.854
Hey, everyone.

09:10.898 --> 09:13.074
This won't take up
too much of your time.

09:13.117 --> 09:15.946
Hi. Uh, I'm in kind of a bind

09:15.990 --> 09:18.340
and need a volunteer
to be my fake girlfriend.

09:18.383 --> 09:19.602
Why do you need that?

09:19.646 --> 09:20.864
Well, I made up
this little white lie

09:20.908 --> 09:22.387
about how I have a girlfriend,

09:22.431 --> 09:24.694
and now I need to prove
to everyone that that's true.

09:24.738 --> 09:25.739
You're talking
to the wrong people.

09:25.782 --> 09:27.958
We don't like it upstairs.

09:28.002 --> 09:30.787
Yeah. You guys
are mean and rude.

09:30.831 --> 09:33.355
Also, it's too bright and airy.

09:33.398 --> 09:36.924
Okay. Uh, well,
sorry to bother you.

09:36.967 --> 09:38.665
I'll do it.

09:38.708 --> 09:40.405
Really?

09:40.449 --> 09:41.711
You will?

09:41.755 --> 09:45.367
Nancy, we don't go up there.
We stay with our kind.

09:45.410 --> 09:47.151
I am not your kind.

09:47.195 --> 09:50.198
I want a better afterlife
than this.

09:50.241 --> 09:52.243
All you guys do

09:52.287 --> 09:54.637
is stand around, talking
about the water heater.

09:54.681 --> 09:55.986
It's boring.

09:56.030 --> 09:57.727
Okay, calm down.

09:57.771 --> 10:01.601
Oh, no, do not tell me
to calm down.

10:01.644 --> 10:03.211
You gave me cholera,

10:03.254 --> 10:04.473
Stuart.

10:04.516 --> 10:05.692
Okay, well, Nancy

10:05.735 --> 10:07.128
has thrown her hat in the ring,

10:07.171 --> 10:08.782
which is... great,

10:08.825 --> 10:11.567
but I want to, you know, be fair
to all of the ladies of the pit,

10:11.611 --> 10:13.351
so, uh, how about the quiet one

10:13.395 --> 10:15.310
in the back there?
With the smile?

10:15.353 --> 10:18.182
Oh. Yeah,
she doesn't have a tongue.

10:18.226 --> 10:20.097
And let me tell you,
that is

10:20.141 --> 10:21.229
her "no" face.

10:21.272 --> 10:23.884
Now, listen up.
I will help you out.

10:23.927 --> 10:25.276
But just to be clear,

10:25.320 --> 10:28.584
there is nothing happening here
sexually.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.891
O-Okay. Noted.

10:30.934 --> 10:34.416
All right.
- Let's do this, then, huh?
Okay.

10:34.459 --> 10:35.765
Oh.

10:35.809 --> 10:37.854
I didn't know
- ghosts could sweat.
- Oh, no,

10:37.898 --> 10:39.203
it's pus from an infected wound.

10:39.247 --> 10:41.815
Ah. That explains it.

10:41.858 --> 10:44.165
Okay, Sheryl, now
that it's just us...

10:44.208 --> 10:45.775
I think. Are you
still there?

10:48.778 --> 10:51.085
Oh, that is...

10:51.128 --> 10:52.695
actually really smart.

10:52.739 --> 10:54.784
Super gross, but I get it.

10:54.828 --> 10:57.091
You are there. Hi. Okay,

10:57.134 --> 10:58.266
here's my thought.

10:58.309 --> 11:00.050
Can you please just admit to Sam

11:00.094 --> 11:02.966
that sometimes you might be
a little too critical?

11:03.010 --> 11:05.403
- Can you believe this?
- It's always our fault.

11:05.447 --> 11:07.797
I mean, she traveled
all this way to see you.

11:07.841 --> 11:10.365
The least you could do
is meet her halfway.

11:10.408 --> 11:13.716
Because she got a point,
all right? I mean, I love you,

11:13.760 --> 11:15.762
but let's be honest,
you can be really tough.

11:15.805 --> 11:17.111
One cheese hurricane.

11:17.154 --> 11:19.069
Yes!

11:19.113 --> 11:22.594
I highly advise you
not to eat it all yourself.

11:22.638 --> 11:24.161
Well, you don't know me.

11:24.205 --> 11:25.206
I'm not too critical.

11:25.249 --> 11:27.469
I just know
what she's capable of.

11:27.512 --> 11:30.037
I still think you should do
what this guy is saying.

11:30.080 --> 11:32.604
Remember when Harold
finally forgave his brother

11:32.648 --> 11:35.738
for running off with his wife?
Whoosh. Up he went.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.174
So, you're saying

11:37.218 --> 11:39.786
if I have some kind of
a breakthrough with my daughter,

11:39.829 --> 11:42.702
I could finally get out
of this hellhole.

11:42.745 --> 11:45.139
So, what do we
think, Sheryl?

11:45.182 --> 11:47.184
If you agree,
just, you know...

11:47.228 --> 11:49.273
Actually, you know what,
no shrimp breath this time.

11:49.317 --> 11:51.319
Let's just see
what happens.

11:52.886 --> 11:55.845
So, there were a lot of rumors
going around today

11:55.889 --> 11:57.368
about how I didn't have
a girlfriend

11:57.412 --> 12:00.023
and about how maybe I just
made that up in a blind,

12:00.067 --> 12:02.852
sweaty panic.
But here she is in the flesh.

12:02.896 --> 12:04.898
- The rotting flesh.
- Shh.

12:04.941 --> 12:06.769
Nancy from the cholera pit.

12:06.813 --> 12:09.903
Yeah. Well,
originally from Albany.

12:09.946 --> 12:13.297
Uh, but then I got sick, and
they threw me in the pest house,

12:13.341 --> 12:15.473
which they told us
was some sort

12:15.517 --> 12:16.779
of recovery ward.

12:16.823 --> 12:18.955
But then they nailed
the door shut.

12:18.999 --> 12:20.696
That was not a good sign.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.394
How did you two meet?
Uh, well,

12:23.438 --> 12:25.005
that's a fun story. Um... Yeah.

12:25.048 --> 12:27.485
He came downstairs
trolling for sex.

12:29.226 --> 12:31.533
She's a joker.
Loves to tell jokes.

12:31.576 --> 12:33.622
It's actually one of the things
I like about her.

12:33.665 --> 12:36.016
What are some
of the other things?

12:36.059 --> 12:38.975
Uh, well,
our shared love of...

12:39.019 --> 12:41.717
- The water heater.
- Right.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.675
Pete, you love
the water heater?

12:43.719 --> 12:46.722
Yeah.
Oh, he-he loves
the water heater.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.203
- Oh, won't shut up about it.
- He could go on for hours

12:49.246 --> 12:52.032
talking calibration

12:52.075 --> 12:53.642
- and combustion.
- Combustion.

12:53.685 --> 12:57.124
- And, uh, corrosion.
- Uh, corrosion.

12:57.167 --> 12:58.473
- And deliming.
- And... deliming.

12:58.516 --> 13:01.128
I love deliming. Yeah.

13:01.171 --> 13:03.304
Oh. Yowza.

13:03.347 --> 13:06.176
Hey, hon. Is
your mom still here?

13:06.220 --> 13:08.135
'Cause I'm sort of hoping
she didn't just sit there

13:08.178 --> 13:11.486
and watch me eat an entire
- appetizer platter for six.
- It was horrifying.

13:11.529 --> 13:13.749
She's here. Hi, Mom.

13:13.793 --> 13:17.057
Sam, I thought a lot
about what you said,

13:17.100 --> 13:19.407
and you're right.

13:19.450 --> 13:21.409
- Sometimes I can be too critical.
- I'm sorry. Look,

13:21.452 --> 13:23.585
th-there's still some
crust over here if you... Shh, shh.

13:23.628 --> 13:25.152
She's talking. Go on, Mom.

13:25.195 --> 13:27.458
It's just...

13:27.502 --> 13:30.766
I butt in when I'm not needed,

13:30.810 --> 13:33.943
and for that, I'm sorry.

13:33.987 --> 13:35.684
And you're not too sensitive.

13:35.727 --> 13:37.904
I shouldn't have said that.

13:37.947 --> 13:39.340
Nope.

13:39.383 --> 13:41.995
This is completely on me.

13:42.038 --> 13:44.998
Wow, Mom. Thank you.

13:45.041 --> 13:47.261
Is this a cathartic
mother-daughter resolution vibe

13:47.304 --> 13:48.305
that I'm getting?

13:50.177 --> 13:53.006
Could you find it in your heart
to forgive me?

13:53.049 --> 13:55.182
Of course.

14:01.231 --> 14:03.364
Maybe you could just say

14:03.407 --> 14:05.279
you forgive me?
You know, like,

14:05.322 --> 14:07.020
actually use the words?

14:07.063 --> 14:09.936
Okay. I forgive you.

14:09.979 --> 14:11.938
Okay.

14:11.981 --> 14:14.854
Maybe louder this time.
And say my full name.

14:14.897 --> 14:16.812
Wait, you're just trying
to ascend, aren't you?

14:16.856 --> 14:19.510
You didn't mean
anything you just said.

14:19.554 --> 14:22.818
- What's happening?
- I can't believe you would say all of those things

14:22.862 --> 14:24.341
just to get sucked off.

14:26.387 --> 14:28.389
Busted. I'm a
dirty, dirty dog.

14:32.915 --> 14:35.483
- I'm so annoyed.
- I'm sorry she did that.

14:35.526 --> 14:37.137
I mean, I really believed her
for a second.

14:37.180 --> 14:39.704
I'm such an idiot.
She's never gonna change.

14:39.748 --> 14:43.404
Look, not all moms can be
Champa Arondekar, okay?

14:43.447 --> 14:46.015
But to be honest, she
probably praises me too much.

14:46.059 --> 14:47.756
- You love it.
- Yeah, you're right. I love it.

14:47.799 --> 14:49.932
It's so great. But
that doesn't mean

14:49.976 --> 14:51.716
that your mom doesn't
love you in her own way.

14:51.760 --> 14:54.850
I mean, here I have
this ridiculous second chance

14:54.894 --> 14:56.417
that nobody in the world
ever gets,

14:56.460 --> 14:58.027
and instead
of taking advantage of it,

14:58.071 --> 14:59.463
I'm in another fight
with her.

14:59.507 --> 15:02.031
I mean, it's just like
the last time we saw each other.

15:02.075 --> 15:03.641
So then don't
let it be. Okay?

15:03.685 --> 15:06.253
Yes, your mother is never
gonna change, but you can.

15:06.296 --> 15:07.776
So don't be the girl
who gets in a fight

15:07.819 --> 15:09.386
and then goes back
to New York angry.

15:09.430 --> 15:12.085
Be the girl who goes back
inside and talks to her mom

15:12.128 --> 15:13.825
while she still can.

15:13.869 --> 15:16.045
That's actually
really good advice.

15:16.089 --> 15:18.265
Really? Do you mind if
I call my mom real quick

15:18.308 --> 15:20.049
and tell her that I
fixed this whole sitch?

15:20.093 --> 15:21.921
You two have
- a real problem.
- Okay, fine.

15:21.964 --> 15:23.966
I'll call her later.
It's not a big deal.

15:24.010 --> 15:25.402
I have a special ring.
Did you know that?

15:25.446 --> 15:27.056
So, like, she'll
always pick up.

15:27.100 --> 15:28.405
So, uh,

15:28.449 --> 15:29.754
we should probably
get going back down.

15:29.798 --> 15:31.060
Glad you guys got to meet
my real girlfriend.

15:31.104 --> 15:32.540
Now it's time
to head downstairs.

15:32.583 --> 15:33.715
- What? No.
- No. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:33.758 --> 15:34.890
Pete, Pete, come on.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.065
She just got here.

15:36.109 --> 15:37.893
Yeah, we don't even know
how long you date

15:37.937 --> 15:40.983
or how far she throw axe.
Actually,

15:41.027 --> 15:43.594
yeah, I thought I might
just maybe stay up here.

15:43.638 --> 15:45.509
What's that?

15:45.553 --> 15:47.120
I mean, we might as well

15:47.163 --> 15:49.600
stop sneaking
around, right, baby?

15:49.644 --> 15:52.647
Well, we're not
- sneaking around.
- I spend every night

15:52.690 --> 15:54.431
in Pete's room.

15:54.475 --> 15:56.912
There. It's out
there in the open.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.045
I feel relieved
- everyone can know.
- Yeah, I feel great, too.

15:59.088 --> 16:00.655
I feel great.
- I feel great, too. What? What?
- Yeah.

16:00.698 --> 16:03.049
- What are you doing?
- I'm not ready to go back yet.

16:03.092 --> 16:05.529
I think I might stay
for a while.

16:05.573 --> 16:08.706
Aw, look, they're
whispering sweet nothings.

16:08.750 --> 16:11.013
You better get used to me.

16:13.450 --> 16:14.712
This guy, right?

16:14.756 --> 16:16.410
Isn't he just the best?

16:16.453 --> 16:17.498
Ooh!

16:17.541 --> 16:19.935
Isn't he just the best?

16:19.979 --> 16:21.067
Oh, yeah. Do that again.

16:21.110 --> 16:22.459
Stop it. You... Aah!

16:26.376 --> 16:28.683
You looking for your mom?

16:28.726 --> 16:29.858
Yeah.

16:29.901 --> 16:31.077
She brags about you
all the time,

16:31.120 --> 16:32.252
you know. Your mom.

16:32.295 --> 16:33.427
She does?

16:33.470 --> 16:35.559
Oh, yeah.
Samantha this, Samantha that.

16:35.603 --> 16:37.039
"She went to Northwestern.

16:37.083 --> 16:39.128
"She moved to New York.
She's so beautiful

16:39.172 --> 16:41.391
"and smart and doesn't talk

16:41.435 --> 16:43.480
all the time like you,
Peggy Sue."

16:43.524 --> 16:46.048
The last part's a bit hurtful.

16:46.092 --> 16:48.050
I didn't know
she felt like that about me.

16:48.094 --> 16:49.530
Of course I do.

16:51.053 --> 16:53.969
I just want you to have
everything you've ever wanted.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.493
That's why

16:56.537 --> 16:57.755
I push.

16:57.799 --> 16:59.627
I just want you to be happy.

16:59.670 --> 17:01.324
I am happy.

17:01.368 --> 17:03.805
I have a wonderful life.

17:03.848 --> 17:06.329
That's all I've ever wanted.

17:07.765 --> 17:09.724
You should come back
for Thanksgiving.

17:09.767 --> 17:12.074
Really? They do
a good Thanksgiving here?

17:12.118 --> 17:14.772
No, it's horrible. Eat first.

17:16.078 --> 17:18.080
- What's happening now?
- Oh.

17:18.124 --> 17:20.169
Mom said we should come back
for Thanksgiving.

17:20.213 --> 17:21.997
That sounds
like major progress, babe.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.607
I'm really happy for you.
Just know that Champa

17:23.651 --> 17:25.435
will then probably want us
to go there for Christmas

17:25.479 --> 17:28.743
- instead.
- Mom, I think I can talk him into...

17:28.786 --> 17:29.831
Mom?

17:29.874 --> 17:32.442
I'm leaving, Sam.

17:32.486 --> 17:33.965
You are?

17:34.009 --> 17:35.880
I can go now.

17:35.924 --> 17:37.708
You've turned out

17:37.752 --> 17:39.449
amazingly.

17:39.493 --> 17:41.234
I'm so proud of you.

17:44.454 --> 17:45.673
The criticism worked.

17:48.719 --> 17:50.286
Goodbye, Mom.

17:50.330 --> 17:52.245
Goodbye, honey.

17:57.511 --> 17:59.469
She's gone, Jay.

18:08.043 --> 18:11.133
Sometimes, when we're doing it,

18:11.177 --> 18:13.135
I'll get on his back
like a horse,

18:13.179 --> 18:15.833
and I'll steer him
around by his arrow.

18:15.877 --> 18:19.054
That is very vivid imagery.
Thank you, Nancy.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.969
I got a lot more images for you.

18:21.012 --> 18:22.666
Here we go.
This one time,

18:22.710 --> 18:25.756
he told me to kick him harder... Nancy is amazing.

18:25.800 --> 18:28.411
Such a... free spirit.

18:28.455 --> 18:30.674
No pun intended.

18:30.718 --> 18:33.503
And I was like,
"You're so wild,

18:33.547 --> 18:35.288
but, okay,
if this is your thing..."And she seems really happy.

18:35.331 --> 18:37.855
You must be a good
boyfriend, Pete.

18:39.727 --> 18:41.946
I wish I could be
treated well like Nancy.

18:41.990 --> 18:44.906
What? What-what
are you saying?

18:44.949 --> 18:46.603
Oh, no, I don't...

18:46.647 --> 18:49.171
Well, it's just
when I was alive,

18:49.215 --> 18:51.826
I was with a bunch
of cheats and liars.

18:51.869 --> 18:54.350
Maybe 'cause I thought
I didn't deserve better.

18:54.394 --> 18:56.135
Well,
you do deserve better.

18:56.178 --> 18:57.962
You deserve the best.

18:58.006 --> 19:00.095
Well, too bad.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.576
Nancy got the
last honest guy.

19:02.619 --> 19:05.405
That's me,
a real straight arrow.

19:05.448 --> 19:08.147
Certainly wouldn't
lie about anything.

19:08.190 --> 19:09.278
We're home, ghosts!

19:09.322 --> 19:11.759
Or empty room.
I have no idea.

19:11.802 --> 19:13.456
They're in here. Hey.

19:16.024 --> 19:17.025
Who's this?

19:17.068 --> 19:18.766
Ah, hi. Nancy.

19:18.809 --> 19:20.507
I'm Pete's girlfriend.

19:20.550 --> 19:22.378
- Pete's girlfriend?
- Huh?

19:22.422 --> 19:23.814
Uh, there's a new ghost.

19:23.858 --> 19:25.816
Sure. Cool.

19:25.860 --> 19:27.949
Yep. Yeah,
Nancy's my girlfriend, uh,

19:27.992 --> 19:30.038
that sleeps upstairs
in my room with me.

19:30.081 --> 19:32.258
We're practically inseparable.

19:32.301 --> 19:34.738
There's no getting away
from her.

19:34.782 --> 19:37.306
Honey? Shall we, uh...

19:37.350 --> 19:39.047
Looks like I'm gonna get some.

19:41.092 --> 19:43.225
So, what happened?

19:43.269 --> 19:46.097
Sleep mode, Sam.
Sleep mode happened.

19:52.278 --> 19:55.237
How are you feeling
about your mom?

19:55.281 --> 19:57.413
Well, I'm feeling happy
for her, obviously.

19:57.457 --> 20:00.111
And that I got
to say goodbye.

20:00.155 --> 20:02.810
But I'm sad because it feels
like I don't have a mom.

20:02.853 --> 20:04.725
Again.

20:04.768 --> 20:06.292
I know.

20:07.336 --> 20:09.338
You know,
she was critical and annoying,

20:09.382 --> 20:11.297
but there's something nice

20:11.340 --> 20:14.125
about feeling
like somebody cares that much.

20:14.169 --> 20:15.388
Young lady,

20:15.431 --> 20:16.998
you are aware

20:17.041 --> 20:19.174
that your luggage is languishing
by the front door.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.394
I know, it's just been a long
day. I'll deal with it tomorrow.

20:21.437 --> 20:23.134
Sorry, Hetty just came in.

20:23.178 --> 20:24.745
Mm, your choice, of course.

20:24.788 --> 20:27.182
It's not the choice I would make
nor the right choice,

20:27.226 --> 20:29.924
but it is a choice
nonetheless.

20:29.967 --> 20:31.273
What are you smiling about?

20:31.317 --> 20:33.101
Something just made me happy.

20:33.144 --> 20:35.103
Well, don't stay like that. You'll get laugh lines,

20:35.146 --> 20:37.148
and your husband will wander.

20:37.192 --> 20:39.194
Must I teach this girl
everything?
