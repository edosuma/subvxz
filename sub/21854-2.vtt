10:17.669 --> 10:20.236
incredible genes, so she
does not like to work out.

10:20.338 --> 10:23.206
It is a real challenge.

10:23.308 --> 10:26.776
I knew "Top Gun" would work.

10:26.878 --> 10:30.447
Don't expect anyone to learn your name.

10:30.549 --> 10:31.681
That's Parker.

10:31.783 --> 10:33.249
I call him Mini-Me,

10:33.351 --> 10:36.019
because he wants to be me so bad.

10:36.121 --> 10:39.477
That's Kara. I call her
The Wall. Drake texts her.

10:39.691 --> 10:41.491
She doesn't text back.

10:41.593 --> 10:42.592
That's Owen.

10:42.694 --> 10:43.960
I call him Valtrex.

10:44.062 --> 10:45.261
He has herpes.

10:45.363 --> 10:46.930
No shade, most people have herpes.

10:47.032 --> 10:48.198
That's Brenda.

10:48.300 --> 10:50.533
She doesn't have a
nickname, wouldn't allow it.

10:50.635 --> 10:53.203
Seniority. She came with the building.

10:53.305 --> 10:57.741
So if you're the right fit,
your nickname will find you.

10:57.843 --> 11:01.244
I'm putting you in
section eight tonight.

11:01.346 --> 11:04.214
And one last thing.

11:04.316 --> 11:05.782
Don't fuck it up.

11:07.319 --> 11:10.754
You got it. You got it, man.

11:15.260 --> 11:17.794
- Hey, Shania, this is...
- Abbi.

11:21.633 --> 11:24.200
Hi... Shania Twain.

11:24.302 --> 11:25.602
Hi.

11:25.704 --> 11:27.537
You have no idea how many times

11:27.639 --> 11:29.305
I have said that this has happened.

11:29.407 --> 11:30.974
Okay! Let's work out.

11:31.076 --> 11:32.861
All right? Let's go, girls.

11:33.412 --> 11:34.811
All right, strong core, nice.

11:34.913 --> 11:36.213
Mm-hmm.

11:36.315 --> 11:38.114
Great, you look... It
looks great, Shania.

11:38.217 --> 11:39.816
Great. Keep those hips back. Nice.

11:39.918 --> 11:42.085
Can we stop?

11:42.187 --> 11:45.188
I just... Honestly, I want to
go home and watch "Friends."

11:45.290 --> 11:47.457
- Oh, I love "Friends."
- Oh, I love "Friends."

11:47.559 --> 11:49.392
I'm such a Chandler.

11:49.495 --> 11:51.094
- I'm such a Ross.
- Total Rachel.

11:51.196 --> 11:52.796
A little Gunther, also.

11:52.898 --> 11:54.211
Oh, I'm a little bit Phoebe.

11:55.434 --> 11:57.701
Trey, you have to do
the Ross impression.

11:57.803 --> 11:58.768
- No...
- Please.

11:58.871 --> 12:00.803
- No.
- Come on, I wanna see it.

12:00.838 --> 12:03.006
If you do it, I'll do the climber.

12:05.344 --> 12:07.177
Uh, uh, uh, uh...

12:07.279 --> 12:08.440
Fine by me!

12:08.475 --> 12:10.213
Ha ha!

12:11.124 --> 12:12.048
You know what?

12:12.150 --> 12:14.885
You owe me a stair climber,
so let's move, okay?

12:14.987 --> 12:16.419
Yeah, you owe us a climber!

12:16.522 --> 12:17.420
Come on.

12:18.657 --> 12:20.257
What's the petit uni?

12:20.359 --> 12:21.181
Oh.

12:21.257 --> 12:23.827
If you have to ask, it's
probably not for you-ni.

12:23.929 --> 12:27.430
No, I know.

12:27.533 --> 12:29.032
We'll have eight.

12:29.134 --> 12:31.301
I'm so sorry, we do not accept Medicaid.

12:31.403 --> 12:32.969
How dare you?!

12:33.071 --> 12:35.272
We want your most expensive entrees.

12:35.374 --> 12:38.341
Did you two take the bridge or
the tunnel to get here today?

12:38.443 --> 12:39.309
Ugh!

12:39.411 --> 12:41.311
My dad owns H&M.

12:41.413 --> 12:43.818
We'll take one of everything, you whore.

12:44.445 --> 12:46.149
Played you, bitch.

12:49.871 --> 12:51.724
Mmm, oh, God, what are you doing?

12:51.725 --> 12:52.761
This isn't you!

12:52.762 --> 12:55.004
You lift people up, you
don't tear them down!

12:57.348 --> 12:58.489
Hm.

12:59.873 --> 13:00.843
Right.

13:01.600 --> 13:02.963
Yeah.

13:03.268 --> 13:05.535
Yeah, that's right!

13:09.241 --> 13:11.074
Marcel, um...

13:11.176 --> 13:13.076
I'm really struggling to be mean.

13:13.178 --> 13:14.511
This just isn't me.

13:14.613 --> 13:16.012
Wow.

13:16.114 --> 13:18.448
I... I have to quit.

13:20.118 --> 13:21.351
Oh, you dropped your scarf.

13:21.453 --> 13:22.419
Oh, my old knees.

13:24.156 --> 13:27.290
Brenda, oh, my God, I'm so sorry!

13:27.392 --> 13:28.458
Don't touch me!

13:28.560 --> 13:30.694
Oh, why, why?

13:30.796 --> 13:32.963
Why me?!

13:33.065 --> 13:34.264
Oh!

13:34.366 --> 13:36.333
Brenda, I'm so sorry!

13:36.435 --> 13:39.369
You did it on purpose, you bitch!

13:43.008 --> 13:44.674
You almost had me fooled.

13:44.776 --> 13:47.077
Marcel, no, it was an
accident, obviously.

13:47.179 --> 13:49.079
Doing bodily harm...

13:49.181 --> 13:51.348
Please... Come on, I didn't... Not...

13:51.450 --> 13:53.650
You a regular Tonya Harding.

13:53.752 --> 13:56.286
I think we found your nickname.

13:56.388 --> 13:57.621
Oh!

13:57.723 --> 13:59.389
Other Tonya.

13:59.491 --> 14:01.524
- Perfect.
- Get away from me.

14:01.627 --> 14:05.028
Strap on your strap-on,
lace up your skates,

14:05.130 --> 14:07.931
'cause it's time to dance.

14:08.033 --> 14:10.009
I'm upgrading you...

14:12.137 --> 14:13.236
to section two.

14:13.338 --> 14:15.171
Fine, I'm in.

14:15.273 --> 14:18.608
But this time...

14:18.710 --> 14:20.910
I'm doing it my way.

14:21.929 --> 14:24.397
All right, we're gonna finish
up with some bungee flies.

14:24.499 --> 14:25.865
- You wanna demo?
- Yeah, okay.

14:25.967 --> 14:28.601
Step in, step in.

14:28.703 --> 14:30.903
You kinda do a little squat here.

14:31.005 --> 14:32.004
Uhh!

14:32.106 --> 14:34.040
And you just crunch it up like this.

14:34.998 --> 14:35.908
Full body...

14:36.010 --> 14:36.942
Abbi, you know what?

14:37.045 --> 14:38.944
Let me do that. Let's switch up.

14:39.047 --> 14:42.682
I just think seeing it from this angle
might be, a little bit, ahem, safer.

14:42.784 --> 14:45.384
So you're gonna keep your
feet shoulder width apart.

14:45.486 --> 14:47.119
Squeeze your arms together.

14:47.221 --> 14:48.988
Really squeezing that chest, okay?

14:49.090 --> 14:50.890
Squeeze and hold.

14:50.992 --> 14:52.692
Squeeze and hold.

14:52.794 --> 14:54.093
Get some blood flowing.

14:54.195 --> 14:55.561
Nice and fast then.

14:55.663 --> 14:57.063
- You feel it?
- I feel it.

14:57.165 --> 14:58.130
- You feel that pump?
- I feel it.

14:58.232 --> 14:59.899
- Oh, Shania! Hey!
- Shania!

15:00.001 --> 15:01.038
- Shania...
- Twain.

15:01.138 --> 15:03.002
We're gonna cool down.
Ready for a cool-down?

15:03.104 --> 15:04.036
- Stretch.
- Yeah?

15:04.138 --> 15:06.038
- And be cool.
- Yeah, let's stretch you out.

15:06.140 --> 15:08.474
We're gonna do an assisted scorpion
stretch, so why don't you hop on the mat?

15:08.576 --> 15:10.386
I forgot how to do that.

15:10.845 --> 15:12.712
Why don't the two of you show me?

15:12.814 --> 15:15.381
Sure. Um, Abbi, you wanna...

15:15.483 --> 15:18.551
hop on the mat there, and
I'll just stretch you out.

15:18.653 --> 15:20.686
Just totally...

15:20.788 --> 15:22.822
Okay. Um...

15:22.924 --> 15:25.086
I know that's your go-to, but
it's actually on your back.

15:25.121 --> 15:26.025
Totally.

15:26.127 --> 15:28.327
So you're gonna get down
on your back, face up.

15:28.429 --> 15:29.662
On your back, on your back.

15:29.764 --> 15:31.864
We're just gonna do a nice
stretch of your hamstrings

15:31.966 --> 15:34.567
and your glutes, so just...

15:34.669 --> 15:36.502
You're gonna want to
breathe into the stretch.

15:36.604 --> 15:37.737
Breathe in deep.

15:37.839 --> 15:38.838
- You feel that?
- Yeah, I feel it.

15:38.940 --> 15:41.774
Okay. Okay.

15:41.876 --> 15:43.009
Okay.

15:43.111 --> 15:44.277
- Is that good?
- Yeah, that's good.

15:44.379 --> 15:46.512
- Hot.
- Oh, my gosh, Shania, Shania!

15:46.614 --> 15:47.547
Okay.

15:47.649 --> 15:49.382
I'm just gonna go use the bathroom

15:49.484 --> 15:50.650
and I'll be right back, okay?

15:50.752 --> 15:51.684
BRB.

15:51.786 --> 15:53.719
- Uh, Shania, let's, uh...
- Let's dish.

15:53.821 --> 15:55.721
Oh, okay.

15:58.393 --> 16:02.929
So, what's going on between
you two co-eds anyway?

16:03.031 --> 16:04.330
What do you mean?

16:04.432 --> 16:05.631
I mean sex.

16:05.733 --> 16:07.600
Not all Canadians are prudes, you know.

16:07.702 --> 16:09.168
Yeah.

16:09.270 --> 16:13.039
Okay, we had a thing, for
sure, but it's... it's over.

16:13.141 --> 16:14.774
You're lying.

16:14.876 --> 16:16.442
- What?
- I can tell.

16:16.544 --> 16:21.013
Listen, I'm a maker of
love songs, a chanteuse.

16:21.115 --> 16:24.917
I can smell that there's
chemistry between you guys.

16:25.019 --> 16:27.687
When there's a spark, you gotta ride it.

16:27.789 --> 16:29.422
Yeah.

16:29.524 --> 16:31.657
Damn, that's a good lyric.

16:34.662 --> 16:39.599
♪ When there's a spark,
you gotta ride it ♪

16:39.701 --> 16:43.970

love, don't hide it ♪

16:44.072 --> 16:46.639
♪ Ooh! ♪

16:46.741 --> 16:48.407
Fuck, I'm good.

16:53.548 --> 16:55.948
- Trey.
- Abbi...

16:56.050 --> 16:58.050
Um...

16:58.152 --> 16:59.318
Say it.

16:59.420 --> 17:00.720
Abbi, we can't do this again.

17:00.822 --> 17:03.089
Say it, Trey. Just say it once.

17:04.692 --> 17:06.079
Bazinga.

17:10.431 --> 17:13.031
You're a good witch, not a bad witch.

17:13.134 --> 17:15.367
Can I interest anybody in a cognake?

17:15.470 --> 17:17.737
This is a cognac and sake cocktail.

17:17.839 --> 17:18.971
Is it good?

17:19.073 --> 17:20.940
Your eyes are stunning.

17:21.041 --> 17:22.708
Oh!

17:22.810 --> 17:23.776
I'll take it.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.444
With that body, please.

17:25.546 --> 17:27.380
You could use a little more
cushion for the pushin'.

17:27.482 --> 17:28.648
You're right.

17:28.750 --> 17:30.483
We'll have three wasabi soufflés.

17:30.585 --> 17:32.718
What y'all gonna have?

17:32.820 --> 17:34.887
Ah, bon soir.

17:36.257 --> 17:38.624
Are you guys high on weed?

17:40.128 --> 17:43.629
I'm getting you 17 spicy
escargot wontons, stat.

17:43.731 --> 17:46.399
Thank you so much, Tim Foil.

17:50.938 --> 17:52.738
I don't like what the new
girl's done with this space.

17:52.840 --> 17:54.006
We gotta go somewhere else.

17:54.108 --> 17:55.007
I'm... I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Trey.

17:55.109 --> 17:56.042
- Okay, okay.
- Yeah. Okay.

17:56.144 --> 17:57.076
- All right.
- All right.

18:01.215 --> 18:02.682
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

18:02.784 --> 18:04.550
This is triggering, we gotta go
somewhere else, this is gross.

18:04.652 --> 18:06.152
- Oh, okay. Okay.
- All right.

18:06.254 --> 18:07.186
Oh.

18:07.288 --> 18:09.655
Well, Other Tonya,

18:09.757 --> 18:12.391
looks like you skipped the gold
and went straight for the green.

18:12.493 --> 18:13.793
I didn't even have to be mean.

18:13.895 --> 18:15.928
I made $800.

18:19.834 --> 18:21.734
I'm off to bring the leftover food

18:21.836 --> 18:23.869
to the homeless of New York City.

18:23.971 --> 18:26.706
Marcel, that's unbelievable,
that is so sweet.

18:26.808 --> 18:28.007
J-K, Miss Thing.

18:28.109 --> 18:30.142
I'm going to a party
at Andy Cohen's place.

18:30.244 --> 18:31.485
See you hookers tomorrow.

18:31.520 --> 18:32.611
Bye, Marcel.

18:33.113 --> 18:34.513
Good night, Dad.

18:35.917 --> 18:37.883
What'd you say?

18:37.985 --> 18:40.052
Well, the reason why I took this job

18:40.154 --> 18:43.956
was because I wanted to
reconnect with my fa...

18:44.058 --> 18:45.658
Bye, guys. Taxi!

18:53.267 --> 18:56.969

18:57.071 --> 18:58.771
Oh! Ow, ow, ow! Oh, my dick!

18:58.873 --> 19:00.773
Oh, ow. I think I broke my dick.

19:00.875 --> 19:03.209
Okay. Okay, uh, uh, Shania!

19:03.311 --> 19:05.711
You call... Can
you call 9-1-1?

19:05.813 --> 19:08.547
Yeah, his dick is definitely broken.

19:08.649 --> 19:09.815
I'll figure it out.

19:09.917 --> 19:12.551
It's your standard penile fracture.

19:12.653 --> 19:13.886
We may have to operate.

19:13.988 --> 19:15.187
Sorry, man.

19:15.289 --> 19:16.155
Ma'am?

19:16.257 --> 19:17.823
No, no, I said man.

Oh. Okay, cool, thanks, Doctor.

19:19.894 --> 19:21.861
Oh, I'm not a doctor.

19:21.963 --> 19:24.830
Okay.

19:26.801 --> 19:28.134
Trey, I am so, so sorry.

19:28.236 --> 19:30.236
No, come on, it's not your fault.

19:30.338 --> 19:33.239
No, I shouldn't have come
in today, this was a mistake.

19:33.341 --> 19:34.840
Are you kidding?

19:34.942 --> 19:36.442
I'm so glad you came back.

19:36.544 --> 19:37.543
Yeah?

19:37.645 --> 19:39.145
We should have kept
it like this, you know?

19:39.247 --> 19:40.746
Physical.

19:40.848 --> 19:42.782
Yeah, well, when there's
a spark, you gotta ride it.

19:42.884 --> 19:44.683
I mean, who knows?

19:44.786 --> 19:46.819
I think we do know, Abbi.

19:46.921 --> 19:49.521
I mean, you're not the
relationship type, right?

19:51.959 --> 19:53.426
Yeah, totally.

19:53.528 --> 19:54.493
Yeah.

19:54.595 --> 19:56.162
You're single Abbi, and that's cool.

19:56.264 --> 19:58.297
Independent woman.

19:58.399 --> 20:00.132
Respect, mad respect.

20:00.234 --> 20:01.901
Yeah.

20:02.003 --> 20:03.302
Good-bye, Abbi.

20:03.404 --> 20:04.703
Bye, Trey.

20:11.112 --> 20:13.212
Wheel me off.

20:18.853 --> 20:21.253
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:22.168 --> 20:24.156
Mike? Mike.

20:24.258 --> 20:25.791
Yeah.

20:25.893 --> 20:28.994
- Let me get your number.
- Okay.

20:29.096 --> 20:31.664
'Cause I am a relationship gal.

20:31.766 --> 20:33.012
Fully.

20:34.163 --> 20:37.898
So this is Shania and I
doing partner-heel taps.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.700
This one is Shania's feet
under the bathroom stall.

20:40.802 --> 20:42.335
She wasn't even peeing.

20:42.437 --> 20:44.337
She was just watching
an episode of "Scandal."

20:44.439 --> 20:46.873
Congratulations. You trained Shania.

20:46.975 --> 20:48.341
I know.

20:48.443 --> 20:53.313
I'm really feeling like
honesty is the best policy.

20:53.415 --> 20:56.816
It's the foundation of any
long-term relationship, you know?

20:56.919 --> 20:58.151
Ours?

20:58.253 --> 21:00.420
Yeah, totally.

21:00.522 --> 21:02.289
But I was talking about Mike and I.

21:02.391 --> 21:03.623
Who?

21:03.725 --> 21:07.060
Mike, the paramedic I met
tonight, who I'm now dating.

21:07.162 --> 21:10.096
- Total... Totally.
- Yeah.

21:10.199 --> 21:11.464
You know, I am pretty impressed

21:11.567 --> 21:14.868
what a four-year
supply of Plan B yields.

21:14.970 --> 21:16.469
- You need it, we have it.
- Incredible.

21:16.572 --> 21:18.104
If I need it, we have it.

21:18.207 --> 21:20.941
And if we ever have any
other female friends,

21:21.043 --> 21:22.814
we will give it to them.
It's available to them.

21:22.815 --> 21:24.215
Yeah.
