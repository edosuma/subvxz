29:04.200 --> 29:05.960
Who for?
I don't care.

29:05.960 --> 29:07.920
Whichever side he's on
puts me on the other.

29:07.920 --> 29:10.080
You're on the Devine side, alright?
No-one else's.

29:10.080 --> 29:13.640
She'll be back, mate. It's not like she's
gonna stay with that oily wop for long.

29:13.640 --> 29:16.520
Mind you, you might have to boil her
to get rid of the grease.

29:16.520 --> 29:18.000
I ain't missing out.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.240
Forget it. Getting personal
stops you thinking straight.

29:20.240 --> 29:21.960
Not that you ever took anything
personally.

29:21.960 --> 29:24.960
Look, any enemy of that Dubbo cow's
a friend of mine, alright?

29:24.960 --> 29:27.520
But there's no angle in fighting a war
for someone else.

29:27.520 --> 29:30.680
What, you expect us to just sit there
on the sidelines and watch?

29:30.680 --> 29:32.360
Yeah.

29:32.360 --> 29:34.760
Watch them all kill each other.
Then who's the winner? We are.

29:34.760 --> 29:36.920
JIM: Tilly's right, mate.

29:36.920 --> 29:38.400
Fucking oath, I'm right.

NUGGET: Ah! I need to wash
my hair, anyway.

29:43.520 --> 29:46.360
KATE: You've gotta be joking.
This is why I joined your operation.

29:46.360 --> 29:48.360
How many fights
have you ever had?

29:48.360 --> 29:50.720
Not enough. That's why I'm going.

29:50.720 --> 29:54.920
Yeah, well, this is
a job for blokes like Wally, hmm?

29:54.920 --> 29:57.280
Big, ugly blokes.

29:57.280 --> 29:59.111
Doesn't matter if they get smacked
in the head.

30:00.720 --> 30:03.518
Tell me how much respect
you'd have for me if I stayed.

30:08.800 --> 30:11.189
See you after, then.

30:17.800 --> 30:19.280
Right to go, then?

30:19.280 --> 30:21.589
Our boys are meeting at the south end,
should have the advantage.

30:24.040 --> 30:27.200
So, uh, see you when I see you.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.840
Unless a razor gets me first.

30:29.840 --> 30:32.877
Oh, don't be stupid. You 'll be back.

30:40.200 --> 30:42.953
