00:53.093 --> 00:54.877
Hmm.

00:56.996 --> 00:58.297
Come on. Quit dawdling!

00:58.331 --> 00:59.967
Who's dawdling?

00:59.999 --> 01:02.001
I'm trying to drink a boat.

01:02.034 --> 01:04.170
You know, my little <i> Schlutchowsen?</i>

01:04.203 --> 01:05.839
For as disgusting, loutish

01:05.871 --> 01:07.974
and incredibly unsightly as they were,

01:08.007 --> 01:11.111
I'm going to miss
those stupid <i> freinfloofers!</i>

01:13.112 --> 01:16.150
Ha! Well, I'm so glad the ferry's here,

01:16.183 --> 01:18.651
so we can finally get off this island.

01:18.684 --> 01:19.987
And when we get back on land,

01:20.019 --> 01:21.354
we'll have a brand new set of wheels.

01:21.388 --> 01:25.025
Yep. It took six weeks
of back-breaking work,

01:25.058 --> 01:26.927
but here we are.

01:26.960 --> 01:28.695
Yeah, of course, four of those
weeks were spent

01:28.728 --> 01:30.264
ensuring all the specifications

01:30.296 --> 01:32.532
were up to Corona Transport Code.

01:32.566 --> 01:34.501
Thank you very much, Max.

01:35.734 --> 01:36.936
Oh, Max.

01:36.969 --> 01:38.605
You're such a stickler.

01:38.638 --> 01:41.108
Aren't you? You're just a stickler.

01:41.141 --> 01:42.242
Look at it.

01:42.275 --> 01:43.644
Good as new!

01:51.118 --> 01:52.987
You should have used your other...

01:53.020 --> 01:54.955
My other foot. Yeah, I know.

01:54.988 --> 01:58.325
Stupid, stupid <i> freinfloofers!</i>

02:02.029 --> 02:06.000
Oh my, that's quite an interesting odor.

02:06.032 --> 02:07.967
It's a Genella torch.

02:08.001 --> 02:10.770
The smell of the pompoen
plant draws the firefly.

02:10.804 --> 02:13.206
This torch keeps it away.

02:17.043 --> 02:19.679
See that? They can't stand it.

02:19.713 --> 02:20.881
All right, then!

02:20.913 --> 02:23.017
Prepare to set sail!

02:23.049 --> 02:25.985
- What is that?
- What?

02:26.019 --> 02:27.888
Oh!

02:27.920 --> 02:29.822
It's just my friend, Pascal.

02:29.856 --> 02:32.192
No, no!

02:32.225 --> 02:34.661
No, don't be scared. He's harmless.

02:34.693 --> 02:36.729
I'm not scared.

02:36.763 --> 02:38.399
It's just...

02:38.431 --> 02:40.667
I don't like lizards is all.

02:40.699 --> 02:43.103
Someone get me my sailing pants!

02:44.905 --> 02:46.440
Sailing pants?

02:55.916 --> 02:57.618
All right! I'll be down in a minute.

02:58.852 --> 03:00.387
You know, Max, there was a time

03:00.419 --> 03:03.357
when I really wanted to own
an island just like that.

03:03.389 --> 03:05.258
But now that I've lived there,

03:05.292 --> 03:07.061
I think I want a better one.

03:08.261 --> 03:10.097
Okay, okay. Let's go below.

03:10.130 --> 03:12.232
Hey, would you look at that?

03:12.264 --> 03:15.101
This is one of my
very first "Wanted" posters.

03:15.134 --> 03:17.437
I've been looking for one of these
to put in the old scrapbook.

03:18.905 --> 03:21.175
Aw, still sour about
never getting your hooves

03:21.208 --> 03:23.210
on old Flynn Rider, huh?

03:28.381 --> 03:30.450
"Keep off railing."

03:30.483 --> 03:31.951
Seriously?

03:31.984 --> 03:33.186
See, your problem is you're too rigid.

03:33.220 --> 03:35.089
You're too suck on procedure

03:35.121 --> 03:36.690
to see the big... whoa!

03:36.722 --> 03:39.025
Oh!

03:39.059 --> 03:42.029
Come on! Let go of me, will ya?

03:42.061 --> 03:44.363
Man, you are a stickler.

03:44.396 --> 03:46.600
Get off!

03:54.774 --> 03:57.044
Hey, hey! A little help here!

03:57.077 --> 03:58.478
What's that, yam?

03:58.512 --> 04:01.548
- Help!
- Oh, I will help myself.

04:01.580 --> 04:03.750
Thank you, kind sir.

04:03.782 --> 04:05.151
No! No, no, no, stop!

04:05.185 --> 04:06.819
We're down here in the water!

04:06.852 --> 04:08.121
Oh, great!

04:08.155 --> 04:09.223
Just great.

04:10.323 --> 04:11.758
Oh ho!

04:11.791 --> 04:13.426
Oh, this is my fault, huh?

04:13.460 --> 04:15.796
Why couldn't you just let me
lean on the railing?

04:15.828 --> 04:18.564
Heaven forbid someone
would break a rule!

04:18.596 --> 04:20.767
Well, don't worry. We're out
in the middle of nowhere.

04:22.169 --> 04:25.039
I'm sure a ship'll just come by
and rescue us any second now.

04:32.112 --> 04:33.813
Okay, I'd like to take
credit for being right,

04:33.847 --> 04:35.515
but that was pure sarcasm just now.

04:41.854 --> 04:43.256
There.

04:43.289 --> 04:44.525
Made it.

04:44.558 --> 04:46.293
Not the nicest of accommodations,

04:46.325 --> 04:48.061
but a boat's a boat, right?

04:49.362 --> 04:51.898
And this boat just happens
to have dozens of jail cells.

04:53.499 --> 04:54.535
Terrific.

04:54.568 --> 04:56.803
Max, we've hitched a ride
on a prison barge.

04:57.903 --> 04:59.505
Hey, hey, hey. Easy, Law and Order.

04:59.539 --> 05:01.175
All the bad guys are locked up.

05:01.208 --> 05:02.775
Now, c'mon, let's go find the captain.

05:06.713 --> 05:09.316
Eugene, you've got to come down!

05:09.349 --> 05:11.985
We're playing charades and...

05:12.018 --> 05:13.320
Eugene?

05:13.352 --> 05:14.888
Max?

05:14.921 --> 05:16.623
Hello?

05:16.655 --> 05:18.025
Huh!

05:18.058 --> 05:19.993
Look, trust me, buddy,

05:20.025 --> 05:22.128
I'm sure this prison barge
is headed to the mainland.

05:22.162 --> 05:23.330
It's got nowhere else to go.

05:23.362 --> 05:25.131
And we'll meet up with
the gang there. Easy.

05:25.164 --> 05:27.667
The last of the guards
has been taken out!

05:27.700 --> 05:28.869
The mutiny's complete.

05:28.902 --> 05:31.038
Did he say "mutiny"?

05:40.614 --> 05:42.349
Whoa. Uh...

05:42.381 --> 05:45.218
Okay, well, a mutiny
may complicate things,

05:45.251 --> 05:46.319
but we can still...

05:46.352 --> 05:48.054
The ship is ours, boys!

05:52.592 --> 05:54.193
Lady Caine...

05:54.227 --> 05:55.862
Anthony the Weasel,

05:55.895 --> 05:57.998
Pocket and Otter,

05:58.030 --> 06:00.266
and every other bad guy
we've ever put away.

06:02.135 --> 06:04.404
Really?! The horse, too?

06:04.436 --> 06:06.939
This boat's like a who's who
of people who want us dead.

06:06.972 --> 06:08.107
In fact, the only guys missing...

06:12.078 --> 06:14.215
are the Stabbingtons.

06:15.782 --> 06:17.785
Looks like the gang's all here.

06:23.455 --> 06:25.891
Okay, so we're in the
middle of a prison break.

06:25.924 --> 06:28.395
Obviously, it's pretty clear
there's only one thing to do.

06:29.729 --> 06:31.063
Are you nuts?

06:31.097 --> 06:32.299
No, I meant get out of here.

06:34.066 --> 06:36.369
Look, I know Max the guard is
supposed apprehend the bad guys.

06:36.402 --> 06:37.436
I get it,

06:37.470 --> 06:38.804
but there is 50 of them,

06:38.838 --> 06:40.207
and not 50 of us.

06:40.239 --> 06:42.842
So, sometimes you
got to put the rules aside.

06:46.078 --> 06:47.780
Now, come on.
Let's go find us a lifeboat,

06:47.813 --> 06:49.482
and get off of this thing.

06:56.523 --> 06:57.790
You hear something?

06:57.823 --> 06:59.759
Nah, that's just your stomach growling.

07:08.667 --> 07:11.937
Won't... budge.

07:17.309 --> 07:19.446
See, yeah, yeah. I know!

07:19.479 --> 07:20.947
Destruction of property

07:20.979 --> 07:23.450
isn't exactly official
maritime procedure,

07:23.482 --> 07:25.386
but neither is a rusty winch.

07:37.297 --> 07:39.299
Oh! Whoa!

07:41.534 --> 07:43.437
Wasn't your stomach growling this time.

07:43.470 --> 07:45.304
I could swear it
was coming from this way.

07:45.338 --> 07:47.474
Pull me up. Pull me up.

07:47.506 --> 07:49.042
I thought I heard a noise over there.

07:50.376 --> 07:52.946
Yeah, no, I could swear it was
coming from this way.

07:52.979 --> 07:54.681
What was that?

07:57.150 --> 07:58.352
Keep your eyes peeled.

08:02.989 --> 08:04.390
Was that there before?

08:07.426 --> 08:09.563
Ooh, dinner! I'm starvin'!

08:10.897 --> 08:12.499
Get...

08:12.532 --> 08:14.501
me...

08:14.534 --> 08:16.336
do...

08:26.011 --> 08:27.346
Ha ha!

08:27.379 --> 08:29.015
Worked like a charm.

08:33.052 --> 08:35.087
Sure. A priceless dagger

08:35.121 --> 08:37.357
I've had for 15 years
drifting away on a barrel

08:37.390 --> 08:39.525
to be lost in the ocean forever.

08:39.558 --> 08:40.558
It's all right, though,

08:40.592 --> 08:43.296
because at least I'm stuck
on a prison barge!

08:47.866 --> 08:49.703
Uh, Eugene?

08:49.736 --> 08:51.105
Maximus?

08:53.405 --> 08:55.375
Uh, Eugene?

08:56.576 --> 08:59.079
Maximus?

08:59.112 --> 09:00.914
Eugene?

09:00.947 --> 09:02.282
Did Owl find anything?

09:08.221 --> 09:10.590
- They're not on the bridge.
- I checked all the cabins.

09:10.622 --> 09:12.626
No sign of 'em in the kitchen.

09:12.659 --> 09:14.593
Ah!

09:14.626 --> 09:16.695
But let... let me go check again.

09:16.728 --> 09:19.064
Guys, I'm starting to get worried.

09:19.097 --> 09:21.233
How could they just disappear?

09:21.266 --> 09:22.736
They didn't disappear.

09:22.769 --> 09:25.405
They were just in the water
yelling for help.

09:25.438 --> 09:27.874
You mean they fell overboard?

09:27.906 --> 09:30.075
Shorty, why didn't you say anything?

09:30.108 --> 09:33.412
I told you we shoulda told somebody!

09:33.445 --> 09:36.015
Aw, I can't stay mad at you.

09:38.451 --> 09:40.587
No, we have to tell the captain.

09:40.620 --> 09:41.955
We've got to turn this boat around.

09:41.987 --> 09:43.957
They could be anywhere by now.

09:47.760 --> 09:50.597
Ya know what I'm gonna
do when we get into town?

09:50.630 --> 09:52.131
I am gonna pillage.

09:52.164 --> 09:53.732
Pillage? Not me!

09:53.765 --> 09:55.267
I'm gonna plunder.

09:55.300 --> 09:56.836
Plundering and pillaging
are the same thing!

09:56.870 --> 09:58.672
Fine. Then, I'll loot!

09:58.704 --> 10:01.907
Pillage, plunder and loot are
all synonymous, you morons.

10:01.940 --> 10:04.243
I prefer to "despoil."

10:04.276 --> 10:06.011
Boys, boys, boys.

10:06.044 --> 10:08.080
Let's not argue over semantics.

10:08.113 --> 10:10.416
There'll be plenty
of time for that later.

10:10.449 --> 10:11.617
Let's keep our wits about us

10:11.650 --> 10:12.685
until we've made it to the mainland.

10:15.655 --> 10:16.823
I just don't get it.

10:16.856 --> 10:19.359
These guys have got to know
that a boatload of convicts

10:19.391 --> 10:20.593
would have the law all over them

10:20.626 --> 10:21.794
as soon as they pulled in to the port,

10:21.828 --> 10:22.996
so what are they up to?

10:24.530 --> 10:26.433
For the last time, no,

10:26.466 --> 10:28.168
we are not going to try to lock them up.

10:29.568 --> 10:30.837
All right, smartypants.

10:30.870 --> 10:32.205
I'll make you a deal.

10:32.237 --> 10:34.039
If you can show me where
it says an off-duty guard

10:34.073 --> 10:36.775
is obliged to quell an
out-of-his-jurisdiction prison break,

10:36.809 --> 10:38.178
I'll think about it.

10:41.079 --> 10:43.682
<i>A Compendium of
Corona Law and Procedure?</i>

10:43.716 --> 10:45.552
Seriously?

10:45.584 --> 10:48.054
You carry this around wherever you go?

10:50.256 --> 10:51.491
Okay, fine, plain English.

10:51.524 --> 10:52.626
If you see somebody do something bad,

10:52.659 --> 10:53.827
you should do something about it.

10:53.860 --> 10:54.895
But here... here's the thing.

10:54.928 --> 10:56.730
I'm sure they don't mean anything crazy

10:56.762 --> 10:59.065
like stopping a prison barge mutiny.

11:01.568 --> 11:03.537
"Such acts include
but are not limited to:

11:03.569 --> 11:05.539
"vandalism, theft," blah, blah, blah...

11:05.572 --> 11:07.841
"smuggling, burglary,

11:07.873 --> 11:11.143
and prison barge mutiny."

11:11.177 --> 11:12.412
Well!

11:12.444 --> 11:14.513
I think that's a stupid book.

11:14.546 --> 11:15.881
Listen, we need to find someone

11:15.914 --> 11:17.550
who knows where this boat
is headed, all right?

11:19.685 --> 11:21.521
And then we get him to talk.

11:28.594 --> 11:30.429
- Psst.
<i>- Si? Che cosa...?</i>

11:39.938 --> 11:41.540
<i>Che stai facendo?!</i>

11:41.573 --> 11:42.943
Lose the act, buddy!

11:42.976 --> 11:45.211
I already exposed you as
the Fake the Giovanni, remember?

11:45.243 --> 11:46.779
All right, fine.

11:46.813 --> 11:47.881
What do you want?

11:47.914 --> 11:49.515
We want to know what you guys are up to.

11:49.549 --> 11:51.918
Now, listen to me,
the Fake the Giovanni...

11:51.951 --> 11:53.219
It's Dale.

11:53.251 --> 11:54.721
I don't care what your...

11:54.754 --> 11:55.789
Dale?

11:55.822 --> 11:57.724
Really? You don't look like a Dale.

11:57.756 --> 11:58.791
All right, Dale.

11:58.824 --> 12:01.193
Yeah, it really doesn't feel right.

12:01.227 --> 12:02.762
Now we can do this the Eugene way...

12:04.563 --> 12:06.198
or we can do this the Maximus way.

12:08.300 --> 12:10.270
I'm not telling you anything.

12:11.770 --> 12:13.707
Well, you'd better be careful.

12:13.740 --> 12:14.774
He means business.

12:20.947 --> 12:22.583
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Max, take it easy!

12:24.083 --> 12:25.117
Call him off!

12:25.150 --> 12:26.620
I'm trying!

12:26.653 --> 12:28.421
He's lost it!

12:28.453 --> 12:29.823
Okay, okay, I'll talk.

12:29.856 --> 12:31.424
We plan to intercept a local ferry,

12:31.457 --> 12:32.559
get rid of its passengers,

12:32.592 --> 12:34.427
and use it for cover
when we get to the mainland.

12:36.094 --> 12:38.597
Ha ha!

12:38.631 --> 12:41.166
I told you these knuckleheads
had to have some kind of...

12:41.199 --> 12:42.468
Ferry?

12:42.501 --> 12:43.636
He means Rapunzel's ferry.

12:44.871 --> 12:46.640
Let's get to the bridge and find
a way to turn this ship around.

12:50.642 --> 12:52.778
We have to go back and look for them!

12:52.812 --> 12:54.748
My friends could be in serious danger!

12:54.780 --> 12:57.616
I'm sorry, but I've got
a schedule to keep, kid!

12:57.650 --> 12:59.119
If those Genella torches stop burning

12:59.151 --> 13:00.919
before we make it to the mainland,

13:00.953 --> 13:02.688
there'll be nothing to keep the firefly

13:02.722 --> 13:04.457
from destroying all these crops!

13:04.490 --> 13:06.293
Raps! Come look at this!

13:12.397 --> 13:13.766
Ah, yep!

13:13.799 --> 13:17.203
What we got here is a barrel of 100%

13:17.236 --> 13:19.773
grade-A gruel.

13:19.805 --> 13:22.708
Oh, from a prison barge.

13:22.741 --> 13:24.977
This is really taking me back.

13:27.079 --> 13:28.647
Wait, Hookfoot.

13:28.680 --> 13:30.883
That's Eugene's knife.

13:30.916 --> 13:33.319
That's where he and Max must be!

13:34.820 --> 13:37.556
Captain, we have to find that barge.

13:37.589 --> 13:39.859
I told you, I got a schedule to keep!

13:42.227 --> 13:44.698
We can do this the Rapunzel way

13:44.731 --> 13:47.801
or we can do this the Pascal way.

13:51.603 --> 13:53.639
You see what happens when
you bend the rules a little bit?

13:53.673 --> 13:56.476
I mean, you won't find that
good-guard-bad-guard technique

13:56.509 --> 13:57.677
in any textbook.

14:02.881 --> 14:05.818
"Good-guard-bad-guard
interrogation tech..."

14:05.852 --> 14:07.654
Wow. This is a...

14:07.687 --> 14:09.923
I have some news for you.

14:09.956 --> 14:11.658
Flynn Rider and his <i> cavallo.</i>

14:11.690 --> 14:12.991
They-a onboard the ship-a.

14:13.025 --> 14:14.727
Ugh! Lose the accent, Dale.

14:14.761 --> 14:16.895
Okay, Flynn Rider
and the horse are on the ship.

14:16.929 --> 14:17.996
What?!

14:18.030 --> 14:20.433
Fitzherbert and Maximus?

14:20.466 --> 14:22.202
There's no escaping those two.

14:22.235 --> 14:25.205
Of course, there's
no escaping us either.

14:25.237 --> 14:26.772
Find them. Now!

14:30.376 --> 14:32.645
Oh, what are you saying?
So it's my fault he got away?

14:35.381 --> 14:37.516
"Don't forget to tie them up."

14:37.549 --> 14:39.551
Ooh! You know what?

14:39.584 --> 14:40.686
I am so sick of this thing.

14:40.719 --> 14:42.521
If you'd let me
just lean over the railing,

14:42.554 --> 14:44.458
none of this would have happened!

14:52.164 --> 14:54.534
Now, this should lead us to bridge.

14:54.567 --> 14:57.470
The bridge is back this way, Eugene.

14:57.502 --> 14:59.304
Ha! You know, I've never heard you

14:59.338 --> 15:00.807
call me by my real name before,

15:00.839 --> 15:02.141
and I've got to say I am touched

15:02.174 --> 15:03.242
that you feel close enough...

15:03.275 --> 15:04.310
Clam him!

15:10.750 --> 15:14.120
Funny how we keep
meeting like this, isn't it?

15:14.153 --> 15:15.622
Funny?

15:15.655 --> 15:18.591
You know, you and I have
very different senses of humor.

15:18.623 --> 15:21.160
Maybe that's why we never quite jelled.

16:00.632 --> 16:01.867
Where you goin', Eugene?

16:01.900 --> 16:03.636
Scared?

16:03.669 --> 16:05.170
Scared? No!

16:05.203 --> 16:06.539
Oh, I get it,

16:06.572 --> 16:07.974
because I keep backing away.

16:08.006 --> 16:09.275
Of course, right.

16:09.308 --> 16:10.809
No, you see, I just needed you guys

16:10.842 --> 16:11.777
to stand right there for me.

16:11.810 --> 16:12.878
Huh?

16:19.385 --> 16:20.886
Rider!

16:21.887 --> 16:23.722
Hey! Now that's better.

16:48.780 --> 16:52.084
Max! Get! Bad horse!

16:52.117 --> 16:54.887
Yeah, hey, you know, this
might not be the time to ask,

16:54.920 --> 16:57.055
but where's the sauna
on this cruise ship,

16:57.088 --> 16:59.925
because I am sore as all get out.

17:07.066 --> 17:08.934
We get to bust out of prison

17:08.968 --> 17:11.738
and take out that
double-crossing back-stabber

17:11.770 --> 17:14.173
and his do-gooder horse friend.

17:14.204 --> 17:15.607
It's a pretty good day.

17:15.641 --> 17:16.843
Well, this is just great!

17:16.876 --> 17:17.876
Thanks a lot, Max!

17:18.978 --> 17:20.780
Oh, this is too your fault!

17:22.949 --> 17:25.285
Look, I don't want to spend
my last moments mad at you,

17:25.318 --> 17:27.886
but, buddy, do you have
to be such a stickler?

17:27.920 --> 17:30.256
I mean, I know you only do it

17:30.289 --> 17:32.191
because you have everyone's
best interest in mind,

17:32.223 --> 17:34.761
but just once I'd like
to see you to let loose

17:34.793 --> 17:35.961
and break some rules.

17:35.994 --> 17:37.463
Who knows?

17:37.495 --> 17:39.765
You might like it.

17:39.799 --> 17:42.734
Or might have liked it, anyway.

17:42.768 --> 17:44.604
Well, if I gotta go down,

17:44.636 --> 17:46.839
I couldn't think of a better
horse to do it with.

17:55.780 --> 17:57.916
Avast, ye mateys!

17:57.950 --> 18:00.053
"Avast, ye mateys"?

18:00.086 --> 18:02.856
Eh, I was in the moment. Fire!

18:12.764 --> 18:14.499
Huh! Fruit.

18:14.532 --> 18:16.368
All they've got is fruit?

18:20.373 --> 18:21.875
Oh, man, do I love that girl!

18:25.110 --> 18:28.280
Going somewhere, Eugene?

18:28.314 --> 18:29.515
Hope you're not picky,

18:29.548 --> 18:32.285
'cause there's only
one thing on the menu!

18:32.318 --> 18:33.953
We'll pay you back, I promise.

18:33.985 --> 18:36.021
There's more where that came from!

18:36.055 --> 18:37.157
Fire!

18:41.961 --> 18:43.128
Oh, come on!

18:43.162 --> 18:46.132
Even you can do
better than that, princess.

18:46.164 --> 18:47.934
I plan to.

18:47.966 --> 18:50.069
Lance, Foot! Now!

18:53.239 --> 18:54.307
Aw.

18:54.339 --> 18:56.009
Now, what are you gonna do?

18:56.041 --> 18:57.443
Oh.

18:57.475 --> 18:58.977
I'm not doing anything.

18:59.011 --> 19:00.981
He is.

19:12.357 --> 19:13.559
Ha ha!

19:13.591 --> 19:15.560
Your friends are gonna make us angry.

19:15.594 --> 19:17.330
A couple of sunny
guys like you? Come on.

19:17.363 --> 19:18.865
Take 'em down!

19:36.581 --> 19:39.484
Who'd have ever expected
that one day, I'd be free

19:39.518 --> 19:41.254
and you'd be the prisoner?

19:41.287 --> 19:43.356
That is pretty funny.

19:43.388 --> 19:45.058
Although, here's the thing:

19:45.090 --> 19:46.758
You may have the sword...

19:46.791 --> 19:49.028
but I've got your feet.

19:49.060 --> 19:50.230
Huh?

20:18.957 --> 20:20.292
You know what?

20:20.326 --> 20:21.894
To heck with the plan.

20:21.926 --> 20:23.295
I'd rather take my chances

20:23.328 --> 20:25.397
sailing this barge to the mainland.

20:25.431 --> 20:28.902
Say goodbye to your girlfriend, Eugene.

20:29.934 --> 20:31.270
Wait, no!

20:39.278 --> 20:40.413
Eugene!

20:42.815 --> 20:43.883
What do ya know?

20:43.915 --> 20:45.851
This thing isn't completely useless.

20:50.923 --> 20:53.159
Hey! Law and Order!

21:01.866 --> 21:03.402
I hate to be a stickler,

21:03.434 --> 21:05.404
but it looks like we're in violation

21:05.436 --> 21:07.173
of the property damage code.

21:24.990 --> 21:27.527
I gotta say...

21:27.559 --> 21:30.329
that was not how I
expected this to trip to go.

21:36.468 --> 21:38.171
Hey, Foot, keep off the railing.

21:38.203 --> 21:40.740
Oh, yeah, or else what?

21:43.741 --> 21:44.810
Whoa!

21:45.844 --> 21:48.047
Or else that.

21:48.079 --> 21:50.148
Rules are made for a reason.

21:50.182 --> 21:51.217
Isn't that right, buddy?
