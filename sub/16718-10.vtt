00:05.560 --> 00:07.200
So far at...

00:08.039 --> 00:10.240
I tell you  Something is
wrong with Dr.  Guthrie doesn't.

00:10.680 --> 00:11.760
His hands are always shaking.

00:12.040 --> 00:14.480
-I am the senior chief physician...
-... who has Parkinson's.

00:14.600 --> 00:16.640
I don't think it's that serious.

00:16.760 --> 00:18.560
And I have a right to privacy.

00:18.800 --> 00:20.760
You stay strong,
you don't give up.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.960
No matter how frustrated
and tired she gets.

00:23.120 --> 00:25.160
Why do I think we're not
talking about Whitney any longer?

00:25.360 --> 00:27.200
The time has come.
Now do you think you know me.

00:28.120 --> 00:30.480
Not yet, but you keep
getting more interesting.

00:47.000 --> 00:47.960
But...

00:48.760 --> 00:51.320
But you said yourself that
diagnosis is difficult, right?

00:51.440 --> 00:52.400
And that's true.

00:52.520 --> 00:53.520
Then how do we know?

00:53.640 --> 00:55.760
Because I've been a doctor
for as long as you have.

00:56.520 --> 00:58.880
Because you are
showing all four of the basic

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
signs and nothing else
explains these signs.

01:01.120 --> 01:03.320
Abe, I know how
Parkinson's works, okay?

01:03.960 --> 01:05.960
Please don't talk to
me like I'm a patient.

01:06.080 --> 01:11.360
Rollie, I know it's hard, but
right now you're a patient.

01:13.560 --> 01:18.040
The Sinemet you gave
me helps against the tremor.

01:19.680 --> 01:22.240
It's good.  And we can
consider other options.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.760
But you have to go with
Dr.  Talk to Campbell.

01:26.080 --> 01:27.360
Why should I talk to Campbell?

01:27.480 --> 01:28.880
Because you have
to tell him, Rollie.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.160
I won't stop, Abe.

01:32.240 --> 01:34.640
You said yourself that it
was progressive, right?

01:35.920 --> 01:39.040
As of yet, my life is not over.

01:39.440 --> 01:43.400
I have had many patients who
have got along well for years.

01:43.520 --> 01:46.520
OK?  Nobody said
your life was over.

01:46.720 --> 01:49.960
I'm a doctor, Abe.
That is my life.

01:51.520 --> 01:52.480
Excuse me

02:02.480 --> 02:03.800
What do you have here?

02:03.920 --> 02:05.480
Woman in her forties,
seat belt passenger.

02:05.600 --> 02:08.360
Head and chest injury,
15 cm shoulder wound.

02:08.479 --> 02:09.440
Why is she wet?

02:09.560 --> 02:10.759
Her SUV rolled
into the L.A. River.

02:10.880 --> 02:11.880
Was there water in there once?

02:12.000 --> 02:12.960
What's your name?

02:16.080 --> 02:17.080
Is that your husband?

02:18.120 --> 02:19.320
She's passed out.  In with her.

02:19.800 --> 02:20.760
What do you have there?

02:21.000 --> 02:23.240
Serious abdominal
injury with seat belt sign.

02:23.360 --> 02:24.880
He was lying face down
in two inches of water.

02:25.000 --> 02:25.960
Short of breath.

02:26.080 --> 02:27.440
-How good is its satiety?
-About 90.

02:27.640 --> 02:30.160
-Noa, what do we do now?
-Highflow O2 and chest x-rays?

02:30.720 --> 02:31.680
As soon as we get there.

02:34.360 --> 02:36.160
She has a deep shoulder injury.

02:36.720 --> 02:38.680
I can't close it until
we stop the bleeding.

02:38.800 --> 02:39.760
A 3-0 nylon thread.

02:39.880 --> 02:40.840
Yes doctor

02:41.520 --> 02:42.560
She's trying to say something.

02:43.240 --> 02:44.760
Cerebral hemorrhage could be
causing the language disorder.

02:45.160 --> 02:46.120
I do not think so...

02:46.240 --> 02:48.960
-And how do you know?
-I don't know, I...

02:49.080 --> 02:50.040
Check the pupils.

02:50.960 --> 02:52.240
Fine

02:52.360 --> 02:53.760
Dr.  Savetti, how do
we stop the bleeding?

02:53.880 --> 02:55.400
-Insert Lido with Epi.
-Good do that.

02:55.520 --> 02:56.680
On three, one, two, three...

02:58.040 --> 03:00.000
-He's not getting enough oxygen.
-Water in the lungs?

03:00.120 --> 03:01.160
The lungs are free.

03:01.280 --> 03:03.000
I do not understand that.
Where's the x-ray?

03:03.120 --> 03:05.240
Jesse, please do an air
bone gap on the patient.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.600
Air bone gap, please.  Come on!

03:06.840 --> 03:07.800
-Right away.
-Thank you.

03:07.960 --> 03:09.040
Come on.

03:15.360 --> 03:17.640
-Dr.  Dixon?
-I asked her she is deaf.

03:18.560 --> 03:20.320
I saw that.
Let's free your hands.

03:21.040 --> 03:22.120
Where can you get
sign language from?

03:22.240 --> 03:23.200
Ex girlfriend.

03:24.120 --> 03:27.000
Ask them what happened.
How the accident happened.

03:29.600 --> 03:30.600
What is she saying?

03:30.720 --> 03:33.840
He fell.  No, slithered...
Asleep.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.080
Append two units 0 negatively.

03:35.200 --> 03:36.960
I put a heart catheter
for the transfusion.

03:37.680 --> 03:39.840
-The saturation is dropping!
-He's not getting enough oxygen!

03:40.520 --> 03:43.240
The systems crash.  Damn it.
Jesse, take over.  I intubate.

03:43.840 --> 03:45.440
Say that...

03:45.640 --> 03:48.920
OK.  "I looked over and he
was slumped at the wheel.

03:49.120 --> 03:51.080
And suddenly we
were upside down. "

03:52.080 --> 03:54.600
His problem was there
before the accident.

03:55.960 --> 03:58.000
The vocal cords close!
The tube does not fit through.

03:58.880 --> 04:00.000
Dr.  Savetti, take over.

04:00.720 --> 04:01.680
Is he her husband?

04:05.520 --> 04:07.200
-What is she saying?
-"He is my...

04:07.320 --> 04:08.280
He is my..."

04:09.120 --> 04:10.080
He is her voice.

04:13.200 --> 04:15.000
-He's got Stridor.
- Gluteal cramp.

04:15.160 --> 04:16.680
The lock on the
neck saved him in the

04:16.800 --> 04:18.040
river, but we won't
let him die from it.

04:18.160 --> 04:19.600
His pulse rises,
saturation drops.

04:19.720 --> 04:20.839
The blood pressure adjusts itself.

04:20.959 --> 04:21.920
He needs a cricothyroidotomy.

04:22.040 --> 04:23.480
If we don't open our
throat, it suffocates.

04:24.360 --> 04:26.760
13-year-old had seizures
during a choir rehearsal.

04:26.960 --> 04:29.080
The local doctors said
she had spina bifida.

04:29.280 --> 04:30.680
-Signs of injury?
-No.

04:34.960 --> 04:37.200
Did I Hear Pediatric Seizures?
What did you give her on site?

04:37.320 --> 04:38.720
We gave her 2.5 units
of Valium on the way.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.040
Let's go.  Is there a
parent or guardian there?

04:41.160 --> 04:42.920
The teacher said her
father was a doctor here.

04:43.080 --> 04:44.040
Who is it?

04:46.280 --> 04:48.360
-Are you closing?
-Yes why?

04:49.120 --> 04:51.400
Will, your daughter has just
been taken to the emergency room.

04:52.400 --> 04:53.800
Come on.  I take over here.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.400
Let's give her oxygen.
I'm putting in a new infusion.

05:08.680 --> 05:09.760
-I'm doing this.
-Good.

05:10.360 --> 05:12.600
She has papillary edema,
it puts pressure on the brain.

05:12.720 --> 05:15.320
Well, let's order a brain
CT and a shunt scan.

05:15.760 --> 05:17.760
-Come on.
-0.25% bupivacaine, please.

05:18.840 --> 05:19.880
Jesse?

05:20.680 --> 05:21.640
Jesse?

05:22.640 --> 05:23.600
I'm sorry.

05:23.720 --> 05:24.720
The clamp, please.

05:28.760 --> 05:30.280
Stop.  Forgiveness.
Forgiveness.

05:34.680 --> 05:36.920
- Hardly any muscle tension.
-Decreased reflexes.

05:38.640 --> 05:42.600
Stop moving.
I have to sedate her.

05:43.800 --> 05:44.880
"I refuse sedation."

05:45.000 --> 05:46.280
Then be calm.

05:51.400 --> 05:55.200
"With cricothyroidotomy, the
chance of being able to talk is 50/50."

05:56.600 --> 05:59.280
-Are you a doctor?
-"Not practicing.

05:59.520 --> 06:02.360
I'm the chairman of
HealthSafe. "Insurance?

06:03.240 --> 06:04.920
"Daniel needs his
voice professionally.

06:05.040 --> 06:07.800
If you take that away from
him, he will have nothing...

06:07.920 --> 06:08.920
We want to save his life.

06:09.440 --> 06:10.440
"Is there no other way?"

06:11.120 --> 06:12.560
How about a
laryngeal nerve block?

06:13.040 --> 06:14.360
-Will that work?
-What's this?

06:14.720 --> 06:17.000
I need two syringes
with 3 ml lidocaine each.

06:17.720 --> 06:20.680
Instead of cutting open the
neck, we block the vocal cord

06:20.800 --> 06:22.800
nerve directly to let it relax,
then we open the airway.

06:22.920 --> 06:25.120
Dr.  Savetti, bring them
to the side panel, please.

06:25.240 --> 06:26.200
Treat them further there.

06:26.320 --> 06:27.880
Tell her we have
it under control.

06:30.760 --> 06:32.000
Dr.  Campbell, we're here.

06:35.440 --> 06:36.920
Vital signs strong
but still unconscious.

06:37.040 --> 06:39.920
She is postictal after a
seizure at choir practice.

06:40.040 --> 06:41.040
She has spina bifida.

06:41.160 --> 06:44.080
This appears to be the result
of a blockage of the VP shunt.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.840
-That happened before.
-That makes sense.

06:46.200 --> 06:47.240
What is your neurostate?

06:47.360 --> 06:50.680
The preliminary examination
caused concern, let's wait for the CT.

06:50.920 --> 06:53.760
In the meantime, let's
see if I can flush the shunt.

06:53.960 --> 06:54.920
I will do it.

06:55.040 --> 06:58.200
No, this is your daughter.
I've done this many times.

06:58.320 --> 06:59.800
She'll get out of
here in no time.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.200
She can't go  She never could.

07:04.920 --> 07:05.960
Do you have my lidocaine, Jesse?

07:08.640 --> 07:10.680
Dr.  Kean, feel the
thyroid cartilage.

07:11.440 --> 07:13.640
Then inject 3 cm to
the side of the midline.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.640
Don't touch the nerve.

07:20.480 --> 07:22.400
-Dr.  Guthrie.
-Not now, Dr.  Pineda.

07:25.800 --> 07:26.920
Leanne...

07:27.160 --> 07:28.360
-What?
-There is a problem?

07:28.760 --> 07:30.040
It's about Dr.  Guthrie.

07:30.800 --> 07:33.120
She needs more benzos.
They don't order drugs.

07:33.320 --> 07:34.640
She had 2.5 units
of Valium on site.

07:34.760 --> 07:35.960
When she wakes up she will...

07:36.080 --> 07:37.440
Your breathing will
be affected even more.

07:37.760 --> 07:39.880
Dr.  Campbell, you
have to let me do this.

07:44.120 --> 07:45.080
Stop!

07:46.560 --> 07:48.480
Dr.  Guthrie shouldn't
do the procedure.

07:48.800 --> 07:51.760
-What's going on here?
- It's okay, I'll do it.

07:52.760 --> 07:54.120
-I do it.
- Look at me.

07:56.080 --> 07:59.080
I won't let anything
happen to her.  Promised.

08:01.040 --> 08:04.200
Dr.  Guthrie, I'll do this.

08:12.840 --> 08:17.280
-The saturation is at 76.
-Scalpel, Jesse.  In the case.

08:20.960 --> 08:24.640
Well dr.  Leighton.  Dr.
Pineda, come and see.

08:25.160 --> 08:27.920
Her spina bifida caused
fluid to build up in the brain.

08:28.080 --> 08:30.080
The resulting traffic
jam triggered the seizure.

08:30.320 --> 08:31.800
Study another kid, Leanne.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.520
The oxygen is high at 85%.

08:55.640 --> 08:57.640
Well, let's scan his stomach.

08:57.760 --> 08:59.240
I lost 20 ml.

08:59.760 --> 09:01.640
Create a culture and have
red blood cells counted.

09:01.760 --> 09:06.360
We'll have to wait for
neurology, but it's stable.

09:14.880 --> 09:15.840
Dr.  Guthrie?

09:18.360 --> 09:19.320
I'm so sorry.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.480
-They are sorry?
-I was at a loss...

09:24.080 --> 09:25.640
You are quite right about that, Malaya.

09:27.360 --> 09:32.040
You are in your second year of
practice, you consider yourself wise.

09:33.160 --> 09:37.000
You overestimate yourself and
don't know what you don't know.

09:38.200 --> 09:39.280
Do you know what that is?

09:39.960 --> 09:40.960
This is Sinemet!

09:42.080 --> 09:44.840
Exactly, Malaya.
I am being treated.

09:45.560 --> 09:48.040
I'm taking this drug
to control the tremor.

09:48.920 --> 09:51.480
If you had asked me about
it, I could have told you.

09:51.600 --> 09:54.280
I asked you, but you
said it wasn't my business.

09:54.400 --> 09:55.360
And that's right!

09:56.520 --> 09:58.720
It is not your business to tell

09:58.840 --> 10:00.400
me whether or not to practice!

10:00.520 --> 10:02.920
Dr.  Guthrie, please.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

10:03.280 --> 10:04.240
Hurt me

10:06.360 --> 10:07.560
Hurt me

10:09.040 --> 10:10.840
Malaya, you humiliated me.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.280
Shame yourself.

10:22.480 --> 10:23.640
Shame on you both.

10:33.120 --> 10:35.520
-He takes Sinemet.
-That has side effects.

10:37.120 --> 10:38.080
He is our friend.

10:38.280 --> 10:41.880
Loyalty to patients
is more important.

10:42.240 --> 10:45.360
-Jesse...
-We did the right thing.

10:45.960 --> 10:47.440
We just should
have done it sooner.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
Dr.  Willis?  There is someone in the
waiting room who wants to speak to you.

10:54.800 --> 10:57.600
-I do not respond to requests.
-He says it's an order.

10:59.800 --> 11:01.880
Here please.  Black
coffee, three times sugar.

11:02.000 --> 11:02.960
Good.  Thank you.

11:03.760 --> 11:05.040
Old army habits are
difficult to give up.

11:06.120 --> 11:08.120
What was so important
that you couldn't just call?

11:08.840 --> 11:11.840
Your dr.  Campbell called
me a few months ago.

11:11.960 --> 11:13.800
He wanted you to be
transferred from the Angels.

11:13.920 --> 11:16.040
Campbell and I had our moments.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.280
That's what you said when
you asked me to do the same.

11:19.120 --> 11:20.080
It's been a while.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.600
I now have a unit that
lacks a chief surgeon.

11:22.960 --> 11:24.480
A doctor applied for a deferral.

11:24.840 --> 11:25.840
His wife had triplets.

11:27.080 --> 11:30.040
If you want a move
I can arrange that.

11:31.280 --> 11:33.360
-When would I leave?
-Next week.

11:34.560 --> 11:35.760
That’s a brisk finish.

11:36.280 --> 11:39.400
This is a great opportunity.  They
would have a unity among themselves.

11:40.480 --> 11:41.440
Do I get time to think it over?

11:43.080 --> 11:44.320
I can stay a little longer.

11:48.560 --> 11:52.280
"We were on our way to Oslo.
We are facing a merger,

11:53.320 --> 11:54.440
I have to go there. "

11:55.400 --> 11:57.800
You have to pedal
quietly for a few days.

11:59.040 --> 12:00.240
"Quiet is not my style.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.440
Will Daniel be able to travel? "

12:05.720 --> 12:08.160
Get another
translator for the trip.

12:09.800 --> 12:13.200
"Daniel has been with me for
25 years, there is no one else."

12:14.920 --> 12:15.920
How do you feel?

12:16.120 --> 12:19.200
I can talk, I've heard
it's like a miracle.

12:22.280 --> 12:23.840
We need to discuss
something else with you.

12:24.160 --> 12:27.440
We did a CT of the stomach
to look at the bleeding.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.240
-There was no bleeding, but...
-You saw the tumor.

12:30.760 --> 12:31.720
Did you know about it?

12:32.800 --> 12:35.480
An undifferentiated fourth
stage stromal sarcoma.

12:37.080 --> 12:38.040
I'm so sorry.

12:38.600 --> 12:41.160
Me too.  It came
back six months ago.

12:41.440 --> 12:43.360
The first time I had
surgery and chemotherapy.

12:43.880 --> 12:45.960
My oncologist says he's
more aggressive now.

12:46.640 --> 12:50.040
He thinks the symptoms
won't get bad for 6-8 months.

12:51.120 --> 12:52.160
Does Kathy know?

12:52.800 --> 12:53.960
The first time

12:54.200 --> 12:56.120
but the timing wasn't
right for this time.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.720
You know what happened
before the accident, right?

13:02.240 --> 13:04.080
-No.
-You passed out.

13:04.760 --> 13:06.080
That's why you
drove over the barrier.

13:06.720 --> 13:07.680
Oh my God.

13:08.840 --> 13:11.280
But is Kathy okay?
Is everything okay

13:11.560 --> 13:13.240
Yes, you both got lucky.
This time.

13:13.560 --> 13:14.520
OK...

13:14.960 --> 13:17.000
The boss would
like to visit you.

13:17.360 --> 13:18.320
I am fine.

13:19.440 --> 13:22.480
Yes.  We missed the flight.
But how are you doing

13:24.080 --> 13:25.240
She makes fun of my hair.

13:25.920 --> 13:27.080
Leave me alone.

13:28.840 --> 13:30.280
Do you know why I passed out?

13:41.520 --> 13:44.120
-He didn't tell her?
-No.

13:44.240 --> 13:48.320
No, he said he passed
out from hypoglycaemia.

13:53.040 --> 13:54.520
What should you do

13:54.800 --> 13:56.280
Maybe I shouldn't
have said anything.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.880
You were obliged
to, like all of us.

13:59.280 --> 14:01.200
Do you remember the
oath  First, do no harm?

14:04.480 --> 14:07.040
-She looks normal.
-I am normal.

14:08.200 --> 14:12.920
-Emily, you are awake.  I...
-Alright.  All right.

14:13.760 --> 14:15.800
Hi emily.  I'll get your father.

14:18.560 --> 14:21.240
-Dr.  Rorish?  She is awake.
-Great.

14:22.040 --> 14:23.000
Is he mad?

14:23.120 --> 14:26.200
Your father?  Of course not.
Why should it be?

14:27.200 --> 14:28.320
Hello!

14:29.160 --> 14:32.240
-I'm Dr.  Rorish, how are you?
-Tired.

14:32.360 --> 14:33.320
I bet you will.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.000
Hey

14:35.120 --> 14:36.880
Hi dad.  What happened?

14:37.720 --> 14:39.880
-Blocked my shunt again?
-Yes.

14:40.880 --> 14:41.840
Has it been fixed?

14:44.120 --> 14:45.400
No, honey.

14:46.480 --> 14:47.960
I'm sorry we tried

14:48.080 --> 14:50.360
but we can't get to the
blockage without surgery.

14:50.920 --> 14:52.320
No.  No surgery.

14:53.320 --> 14:56.400
What happened?
Did you have a headache

14:57.640 --> 14:59.080
-Was you sick?
-I do not know.

14:59.200 --> 15:02.120
That is not an answer.
Did you have a headache

15:02.560 --> 15:03.520
Yes or no?

15:04.680 --> 15:06.320
-Emily?
-Maybe we should...

15:06.440 --> 15:09.320
-I didn't think it was that bad.
-I keep telling you

15:09.480 --> 15:11.680
if you feel bad
you have to tell me

15:13.720 --> 15:15.240
-Otherwise something like this will happen.
-Yes.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.040
And it happens to me.
I have to deal with it.

15:18.240 --> 15:19.880
-No, we both have to.
-Listen to me!

15:20.080 --> 15:22.400
-We both have to get along.
-Will, she needs rest.

15:22.600 --> 15:24.000
I'll take over now, Dr.  Rorish.

15:24.200 --> 15:26.240
I didn't say anything because I knew
you were freaking out like you are now.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.280
You do not listen to me.
I don't want an operation.

15:28.400 --> 15:29.640
Do you think that is unimportant?

15:29.760 --> 15:31.120
This is important, Emily.

15:31.560 --> 15:33.320
-That's your life.
-Will, please.

15:33.440 --> 15:36.360
-I said I'll take over.
-No, you won't.

15:36.640 --> 15:39.080
She is my patient
and I want you to go.

15:43.120 --> 15:44.080
Talk to her.

15:54.160 --> 15:55.320
More patients?

15:58.840 --> 15:59.800
My help?

16:01.360 --> 16:03.080
What about daniel?
Can't he help?

16:06.440 --> 16:07.560
Okay who should I call?

16:08.160 --> 16:11.280
Sir, get me some sutures
and some lidocaine, please?

16:12.280 --> 16:13.240
LA Times?

16:14.600 --> 16:15.560
New York... okay.

16:16.840 --> 16:19.520
I really can't... Please.

16:19.640 --> 16:22.520
I'm so sorry.  Moment.
Where is this patient?

16:22.640 --> 16:23.640
Times business desk.

16:25.240 --> 16:27.000
Hello, this is Elliot Dixon.

16:27.480 --> 16:30.600
No sorry.  This is Kathy Byrne

16:30.840 --> 16:32.200
and Elliot Dixon translated.

16:32.640 --> 16:34.040
Good.  Hello Ms. Byrne.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.680
-Stay calm.
-What's going on?

16:36.960 --> 16:38.120
For the beginning...

16:38.440 --> 16:40.160
I think he interprets
for you.  Sit up.

16:40.280 --> 16:41.840
Incredible.  It looks like her.

16:42.360 --> 16:44.400
She doesn't take a day off,
not even after an accident.

16:44.560 --> 16:46.000
... more and more
market dominance?

16:47.280 --> 16:50.800
I would start with why
mergers save money.

16:51.600 --> 16:54.680
Mass production,
synergy effects, reduced

16:54.800 --> 16:58.880
development costs and
reduced product range.

16:59.360 --> 17:00.800
And she obviously
doesn't need me.

17:02.200 --> 17:04.440
-This is our fate, isn't it?
-Our fate?

17:05.240 --> 17:06.359
When we work for others, we

17:06.480 --> 17:08.359
consider our
relationship personal.

17:11.520 --> 17:13.520
I only work for the patients.

17:23.280 --> 17:26.160
I got your three pings.
Everything is unchanged.

17:26.280 --> 17:27.240
She is stable...

17:27.440 --> 17:28.640
How long have you
known about Guthrie?

17:29.400 --> 17:32.440
I stepped in and
intervened immediately...

17:32.560 --> 17:33.880
Is Malaya the only
one who knows?

17:34.640 --> 17:35.600
OK...

17:36.360 --> 17:37.520
I'm not getting into that.

17:37.920 --> 17:39.720
You are troubled, emotional,
now is the wrong time.

17:39.840 --> 17:42.880
Malaya Pineda is suspended.
From now on.

17:43.160 --> 17:44.800
-What?
-My daughter, Leanne!

17:45.120 --> 17:46.720
Is that Emily's father speaking?

17:47.320 --> 17:50.080
Because I thought I was talking
to the emergency room chief.

17:57.080 --> 17:59.080
I took ibuprofen
against it, but...

17:59.200 --> 18:00.520
When was the last
time this was examined?

18:00.880 --> 18:02.520
The military is
so bureaucratic...

18:02.680 --> 18:05.000
Dr.  Savetti, Dr.  Kean,
you already know my CO.

18:05.240 --> 18:06.800
I told them about the
bullet in my arm and that

18:06.920 --> 18:09.400
it reminded me that
shooting yourself hurts too.

18:09.520 --> 18:12.480
He had an untreated
skull fracture for years.

18:12.880 --> 18:15.080
He shows partial
mobility and numbness.

18:16.200 --> 18:17.160
Do you have pain?

18:17.880 --> 18:21.040
As always, I said
I take ibuprofen...

18:21.520 --> 18:24.160
-I can give something stronger.
-I said I'm fine.

18:24.880 --> 18:26.040
Let us help you.

18:27.120 --> 18:28.080
OK.

18:28.200 --> 18:31.200
I'll fill out this order,
but you'll get an MRI.

18:31.400 --> 18:33.480
-An MRI?
-That's my job.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.240
Let me help you.

18:36.680 --> 18:37.640
OK.

18:37.960 --> 18:41.440
-Good.  Should i follow
-General?  Who is the doctor

18:41.880 --> 18:43.760
-I want to send him something...
-The what?

18:44.120 --> 18:45.120
The doctor with the triplets.

18:45.400 --> 18:48.760
Oh, Henderson.  Harrison.
Something with H. I'll find out.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.120
You have a duty to the hospital.

18:57.240 --> 18:58.880
And now you wanna
tell me how to work

18:59.000 --> 19:00.840
I'm telling you that
Campbell's daughter has

19:00.960 --> 19:02.560
been endangered and
that was unnecessary.

19:02.680 --> 19:03.680
Do you think i don't know

19:07.120 --> 19:08.080
Why didn't you say it

19:10.680 --> 19:12.080
Because I had that under control.

19:12.200 --> 19:14.240
That's not how we work
here, and you know it.

19:14.800 --> 19:17.960
I made a mistake.
But it was mine

19:18.200 --> 19:20.280
and it has nothing
to do with you.

19:20.560 --> 19:23.080
-You are my right hand.
-I have my own hands.

19:23.240 --> 19:25.640
I am not an assistant.
I am a nurse.

19:28.880 --> 19:29.840
Is everything okay

19:32.000 --> 19:33.280
Yes, it's all fine.

19:34.520 --> 19:35.480
Forgiveness.

19:37.160 --> 19:38.120
My CO is here.

19:41.480 --> 19:43.200
He says he can send
me back to Afghanistan.

19:44.840 --> 19:47.240
-When?
-In a week.

19:52.120 --> 19:54.040
He is supposed to go to follow-up
care and do a complete blood count.

19:54.880 --> 19:55.840
Can I talk to you?

19:57.360 --> 19:58.320
No.

19:58.440 --> 20:00.320
There are rules about
what you are up to.

20:00.440 --> 20:03.960
And I'm in charge of surgery.
I will enforce it or not.

20:04.240 --> 20:05.760
When did you want to tell
me you have a daughter

20:05.880 --> 20:07.080
I didn't intend to.

20:07.280 --> 20:09.560
Is that why you never stayed
overnight when we were together?

20:11.400 --> 20:12.360
We weren't together.

20:15.680 --> 20:17.400
Well wait a minute.

20:19.160 --> 20:21.560
Please keep calm, I
need to do more tests.

20:22.960 --> 20:25.920
It might hurt for a moment, but
wait a minute... wait a minute.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.880
Stop, please, stop!

20:31.720 --> 20:33.400
I understand that
you are scared.

20:33.520 --> 20:36.280
I'm not afraid.  I just don't
want that.  I've had enough.

20:36.400 --> 20:37.760
-Sweet, sweetie...
-OK.

20:38.600 --> 20:39.560
Stop it.

20:40.320 --> 20:42.640
I'll sing Ave Maria at
the concert next week.

20:42.840 --> 20:44.400
I don't do anything else.

20:48.720 --> 20:49.680
Fine

20:54.320 --> 20:56.360
-It's my first solo...
-I know.

20:57.040 --> 20:58.480
Do you know what we do now

20:59.360 --> 21:00.600
I dont do this.  You do it.

21:03.040 --> 21:04.320
How about we do it together

21:05.160 --> 21:06.120
Give me your hand.

21:07.080 --> 21:08.040
There you are.

21:09.480 --> 21:11.720
We hold our anger in our hands

21:13.760 --> 21:16.200
and we'll look at
them very carefully.

21:16.760 --> 21:18.560
This is how we find
out what it really is.

21:19.960 --> 21:22.320
What is she honey  Come over.

21:27.440 --> 21:28.400
What do we see?

21:31.000 --> 21:32.200
It will never go away.

21:36.160 --> 21:37.120
OK.

21:39.200 --> 21:40.640
Now that we know
what the anger is

21:43.240 --> 21:44.520
what do we ask ourselves then?

21:46.600 --> 21:47.840
Will she help us?

21:49.480 --> 21:50.440
Exactly.

21:51.160 --> 21:53.320
And does she help us?

21:55.200 --> 21:56.400
-No she does not.
-No.

22:02.160 --> 22:03.120
So what do we do now?

22:04.400 --> 22:05.360
Let go of you.

22:05.960 --> 22:06.920
Let go of you.

22:07.640 --> 22:09.080
Like a bird that
flies in the sky.

22:09.840 --> 22:11.080
Like a bird that
flies in the sky.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.360
Exactly, this is my girl.

22:17.600 --> 22:18.560
It's fine baby

22:27.520 --> 22:29.760
-He suspended her.
-What?  Who?

22:29.880 --> 22:30.840
Malaya.

22:32.200 --> 22:33.160
For what?

22:33.280 --> 22:35.520
Because she knew about
Guthrie and didn't say anything.

22:36.560 --> 22:37.560
Like us.

22:38.400 --> 22:39.480
Campbell doesn't
know that, does he?

22:39.600 --> 22:41.480
The only difference between
us and Malaya is that...

22:41.600 --> 22:42.560
Slow down.

22:42.680 --> 22:44.040
-... had the courage to say something.
-So what?

22:44.160 --> 22:45.120
We should have helped her.

22:45.240 --> 22:47.240
You want to go to Campbell
so he can suspend us too?

22:47.760 --> 22:50.480
-We're talking about our career.
-We're talking about our girlfriend.

22:55.760 --> 22:57.640
There was an empty bed.
I should embarrass them.

22:57.880 --> 22:58.880
Naturally.

23:02.680 --> 23:05.640
"I'll postpone everything until next
week until then everything will be okay."

23:05.840 --> 23:06.960
Say I can't.

23:07.320 --> 23:09.520
I think I should
stay out of that.

23:09.640 --> 23:11.720
-I can raise you up to...
-Show her that.

23:14.640 --> 23:17.080
An email from Andy Singer.

23:17.280 --> 23:19.320
He said you were looking
for a replacement for me.

23:20.360 --> 23:24.040
You are not allowed to cancel the
trip because of your responsibility.

23:24.640 --> 23:27.520
Oversensitive?  We had
an accident two hours ago.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.320
Are you already looking
for a replacement for me?

23:34.280 --> 23:37.080
-I should have closed that.
-Moment.  I am so sorry.

23:38.840 --> 23:40.120
I wasn't ready to say it yet.

23:41.400 --> 23:44.320
Yes, that's why I
passed out in the car.

23:45.600 --> 23:48.080
I wanted to tell you.  No!  I...

23:49.400 --> 23:51.880
Stop!  Leave that open.
You don't have to do that.

23:52.640 --> 23:53.600
Moment!

23:57.240 --> 23:58.200
Can you tell her...

24:07.160 --> 24:09.520
Campbell, the man is with us

24:10.240 --> 24:12.520
and one of us... for decades.

24:13.120 --> 24:15.000
The people are the
heart of this place.

24:15.120 --> 24:18.520
They give everything every
day, every shift, every case.

24:20.080 --> 24:21.680
Guthrie is the Angels.

24:22.440 --> 24:24.520
Even so, you couldn't
fire him fast enough.

24:25.240 --> 24:26.240
I didn't fire him

24:28.760 --> 24:29.760
he resigned.

24:34.920 --> 24:37.040
I once ran about 30 km through

24:37.160 --> 24:39.320
the Hindu Kush
with a broken thigh.

24:39.760 --> 24:40.960
Sorry, hospital rules.

24:41.560 --> 24:44.160
Have you never been to the orthopedic
surgeon?  How long have you been hurt?

24:44.280 --> 24:47.400
Since Kandahar four years
ago, with medication, it's okay.

24:49.040 --> 24:51.160
-Don't you want water?
-That's okay.

24:51.680 --> 24:54.400
If you take them like
that, they work faster.

24:54.520 --> 24:55.480
Right?

24:55.640 --> 24:57.400
You don't always have clear
water when you're working.

24:57.520 --> 24:58.560
But they taste disgusting.

24:59.240 --> 25:01.360
Nobody would chew them like
that, only in an absolute emergency.

25:01.800 --> 25:02.800
Mario.

25:04.040 --> 25:06.520
That's true.  Small
dogs bark the loudest.

25:07.040 --> 25:08.560
What?  Do you think they are tough

25:08.680 --> 25:10.800
with your little pajamas
and teenage tattoos?

25:11.880 --> 25:14.240
You wouldn't know
if it kicked your ass.

25:14.440 --> 25:16.520
But keep up the good
work, maybe we can find out.

25:16.760 --> 25:18.320
And what kind of
games are you playing?

25:19.040 --> 25:21.360
Four years of narcotics and
you haven't seen a doctor?

25:21.880 --> 25:23.600
It sounds to me like
you don't want to get well.

25:23.720 --> 25:25.240
- Excuse me?
-Dr.  Savetti.

25:26.160 --> 25:27.280
Dr.  Kean, we'll be right there.

25:30.160 --> 25:31.880
-What are you doing?
-Help my patient.

25:32.040 --> 25:33.000
He's not your patient.

25:33.120 --> 25:36.320
I don't give prescriptions to
friends, colleagues or the boss.

25:36.520 --> 25:37.480
Pay attention.

25:37.760 --> 25:40.640
Like it or not, your
general has a problem.

25:41.360 --> 25:42.320
It's not just his shoulder.

25:42.440 --> 25:45.160
An injury like this can
cost him his career.

25:45.320 --> 25:47.120
Put it out of service
and then live with it.

25:47.520 --> 25:49.280
-This is your style.
-This is your diagnosis?

25:49.560 --> 25:50.680
An acute case of denial?

25:50.800 --> 25:52.320
Do you have any idea what
the man was going through?

25:52.640 --> 25:53.840
What each of us went through?

25:53.960 --> 25:56.440
No, but I do
recognize addictions.

25:56.600 --> 25:57.880
Dr.  Willis, come quickly.

25:58.320 --> 25:59.840
-The pulse is weak.
-Get him out.

25:59.960 --> 26:01.680
-He is unconscious.
-He's not breathing.

26:01.800 --> 26:03.200
Dr.  Savetti, the emergency vehicle.

26:07.040 --> 26:08.560
That was it.
There are only two left.

26:09.440 --> 26:10.560
How many have you
prescribed for him?

26:10.760 --> 26:13.720
Twelve.  He's overdosed.
Two milligrams of naloxone.

26:13.960 --> 26:14.920
All right.

26:16.800 --> 26:17.760
It's entered.

26:39.760 --> 26:41.960
-Thank you for being there.
-For Emily anytime.

26:42.280 --> 26:43.720
-I have to change my clothes.
-Good.

26:44.280 --> 26:47.240
Did you check that there is no
cell dividing cyst on the shunt?

26:47.360 --> 26:48.320
We excluded that.

26:49.240 --> 26:50.760
Then go.  Good.

26:53.320 --> 26:56.360
Dr.  Fields is L.A.'s most
respected pediatric neurosurgeon

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Yes.

26:58.160 --> 27:01.040
-She is in good hands.
-I just want to be able to trust.

27:02.320 --> 27:03.680
That's why you get
ready for the operation.

27:07.160 --> 27:09.880
I told her, but she
doesn't listen to me.

27:10.800 --> 27:13.520
I would prefer you to stay a

27:13.640 --> 27:14.960
little longer so
we can watch you.

27:15.200 --> 27:17.200
-"I have to work again."
-OK.

27:17.680 --> 27:19.240
I'm getting your
discharge papers ready.

27:37.720 --> 27:40.600
His heart is healthy.
Why is he not responding?

27:43.120 --> 27:46.320
Leanne, his QT times are up.

27:49.600 --> 27:51.520
I think he has hypocalcemia.

27:52.400 --> 27:54.880
It has to be.
Bone metastases from cancer.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.000
Give him calcium.

28:12.720 --> 28:14.360
-Looks like a sine wave.
-OK.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.960
Give him an infusion
at 1 mg per kg per hour.

28:18.080 --> 28:20.960
Check for anionized
calcium every 30 minutes.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
Mummy.

28:24.280 --> 28:26.640
Jesse, thank you.

28:28.480 --> 28:29.520
Mummy.

28:30.920 --> 28:31.880
All right.

28:42.800 --> 28:43.960
Tweezers.

28:51.280 --> 28:52.520
It won't come out.

28:52.760 --> 28:56.160
Sometimes the catheter
is scarred.  Just drag.

28:58.640 --> 28:59.680
Here you go.

29:02.200 --> 29:03.200
Suction.

29:07.640 --> 29:09.800
She was born with a dimple
at the end of the spine.

29:11.560 --> 29:12.520
This is how it begins.

29:14.440 --> 29:18.640
We were told that she would
never go and would soon die.

29:21.640 --> 29:24.480
My wife couldn't
stand it and left us.

29:25.680 --> 29:26.640
They are alone?

29:28.000 --> 29:28.960
As a couple.

29:30.520 --> 29:34.000
Emily and me.
We'll get through this together.

29:36.720 --> 29:38.440
She is bound to a wheelchair.

29:38.600 --> 29:42.320
She has neither bladder
nor bowel function.

29:44.680 --> 29:46.600
She must be catheterized
every three hours.

29:48.160 --> 29:49.760
She's been doing this
alone since she was four.

29:55.360 --> 29:57.520
We live our life in
3-hour segments.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
There is no light at
the end of the tunnel.

30:03.800 --> 30:08.400
Only she... She is...
She is the light.

30:10.480 --> 30:11.440
Yes that's her.

30:12.680 --> 30:14.560
But she wants to
be a normal kid.

30:15.880 --> 30:17.280
And that means that
she makes mistakes.

30:20.400 --> 30:22.480
If she makes mistakes,
she ends up here.
