WEBVTT

02:00.620 --> 02:02.270
- Is that all?
- Yeah, that's it.

02:02.470 --> 02:03.490
That'll be 90 cents.

02:08.420 --> 02:09.880
Okay. Keep the change.

02:10.880 --> 02:12.210
Much appreciated.

02:13.250 --> 02:16.170
- Hold on a bit, I'll get the truck.
- Hurry up.

02:20.970 --> 02:22.430
What a freak.

02:30.480 --> 02:32.230
What the fuck?

02:36.610 --> 02:39.310
Stop! Stop, you bastard!

02:39.500 --> 02:41.350
How did you do it? Get out.

02:41.550 --> 02:42.830
Get out. Fuck.

02:45.950 --> 02:47.330
Drop the hammer.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.130
Or what, pretty boy?

02:56.380 --> 02:57.720
Don't make me do it.

02:59.720 --> 03:01.090
Stop right there!

03:04.430 --> 03:05.760
Don't come any closer!

03:17.740 --> 03:18.820
Ian!

03:24.370 --> 03:25.810
Ian, son!

03:26.010 --> 03:27.080
Ian, snap out of it.

03:27.830 --> 03:30.480
What have you done? Let's go.

03:30.680 --> 03:31.830
Quick!

03:34.080 --> 03:35.170
Help!

03:37.760 --> 03:39.820
- Help!
- It's okay, ma'am.

03:40.020 --> 03:41.700
- What happened?
- I've been shot.

03:41.900 --> 03:43.120
- Where?
- I've been shot.

03:43.320 --> 03:45.470
You're not hurt. You weren't hit, relax.

03:47.260 --> 03:48.390
No way!

03:49.100 --> 03:50.270
I've been robbed.

03:59.490 --> 04:01.220
The truck!

04:01.420 --> 04:02.930
It's the third one this year.

04:03.130 --> 04:05.220
- It's stolen.
- But I like this one.

04:05.420 --> 04:07.950
Do whatever you have to,
but don't let them see it.

04:23.470 --> 04:25.290
Why the hell did you do that?

04:25.490 --> 04:28.370
Don't you remember the rules?
We have two rules.

04:28.570 --> 04:30.290
Rule number one, never stand out.

04:30.490 --> 04:33.520
And number two,
don't play tricks on family. I know.

04:42.860 --> 04:45.100
Why do we always
have to settle for crumbs?

04:45.300 --> 04:47.770
We could pull off a heist and live large!

04:47.970 --> 04:49.700
Ian, please, not again.

04:59.210 --> 05:00.400
I go to a bank.

05:00.600 --> 05:03.530
I make them believe I have a check,
and free money!

05:03.730 --> 05:06.160
No. I told you.
Banks are the major league,

05:06.360 --> 05:07.890
and we play in the minors.

05:08.430 --> 05:10.960
They'd find us
before we could spend a euro.

05:11.160 --> 05:13.100
They'd find us? Who?

05:14.180 --> 05:15.250
Let me be clear.

05:15.450 --> 05:18.670
If they catch you,
they'll take you to a lab. Remember that.

05:18.870 --> 05:21.090
They'll run tests without your permission.

05:21.290 --> 05:24.610
That's why we have rules.
To live in peace, respect the rules.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.660
Code 10-43, aggravated robbery.

05:35.330 --> 05:36.770
Suspect in a Lancia Delta.

05:36.970 --> 05:39.420
Southbound on Road 212.

05:40.670 --> 05:42.070
Stop the vehicle immediately.

05:42.270 --> 05:45.050
I repeat, stop the vehicle!

05:49.340 --> 05:51.160
Ian. Hold on.

05:51.360 --> 05:52.290
What are you doing?

05:52.490 --> 05:53.870
<i>Stop the vehicle right now!</i>

05:54.070 --> 05:56.230
Ian, you're not as good as you think.

05:58.520 --> 05:59.940
Stop the...

07:01.040 --> 07:02.330
A full tank, chief?

07:03.710 --> 07:07.450
GAS STATION

07:07.650 --> 07:08.370
MAIN STREET

07:08.570 --> 07:09.930
Yes. I'm watching it.

07:10.510 --> 07:11.840
Good job.

07:20.770 --> 07:22.100
Finally.

07:40.370 --> 07:43.000
Paca! My Paca.

07:44.210 --> 07:46.550
Pretty little thing!

07:48.380 --> 07:49.590
Come here.

08:09.740 --> 08:14.180
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

08:14.380 --> 08:15.270
There we go.

08:15.470 --> 08:19.310
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

08:19.510 --> 08:21.580
All right, Dad. I heard you!

08:22.410 --> 08:24.570
Stop singing. I have a headache.

08:24.770 --> 08:28.380
<i>Happy birthday from your dad</i>

08:30.130 --> 08:35.970
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

08:38.850 --> 08:40.850
- Come on, make a wish.
- Okay.

08:44.650 --> 08:46.560
Yay!

08:47.190 --> 08:48.610
Thanks, Dad.

08:51.150 --> 08:53.800
I've been thinking all night.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.570
And I have a plan.

08:57.620 --> 09:00.100
I'll find a job as a mechanic.

09:00.300 --> 09:03.560
So you can focus on your Biology degree.

09:03.760 --> 09:06.400
With that brain of yours,
it'll take no time.

09:06.600 --> 09:08.290
And we start living!

09:11.880 --> 09:13.800
We already lost your mom.

09:14.970 --> 09:16.930
I don't want to lose you too.

09:17.930 --> 09:22.100
Do you know what else
I've been thinking about all night? Look.

09:22.560 --> 09:23.600
Look at this.

09:24.390 --> 09:25.890
Isn't she beautiful?

09:28.650 --> 09:33.720
The day you discovered
you could do all those things you do.

09:33.920 --> 09:36.510
As a kid you were obsessed
with two things,

09:36.710 --> 09:40.940
animal cookies and balloons.
"A balloon, a balloon."

09:41.130 --> 09:45.270
You were always bugging us
to buy you more balloons.

09:45.470 --> 09:46.820
And that day, who knows,

09:47.020 --> 09:48.670
you probably got fed up.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.010
And decided to make them yourself.

09:54.130 --> 09:55.670
Later, I don't know why,

09:57.300 --> 10:01.430
you suddenly made them all pop at once.

10:02.470 --> 10:03.850
I'm leaving.

10:06.350 --> 10:07.770
No. Where to? Come back.

10:08.400 --> 10:12.470
- I told you yesterday. I have plans.
- Right, but it's a bad idea.

10:12.670 --> 10:14.740
I've been living in this boat for years.

10:15.190 --> 10:16.530
By your rules.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.610
Listen.

10:20.370 --> 10:22.950
I'm just going to the arcade for a while.

10:23.950 --> 10:26.940
Is doing something normal for once
that dangerous?

10:27.140 --> 10:28.570
- It's just that...
- For once.

10:28.770 --> 10:30.650
You're not normal.

10:30.850 --> 10:33.570
And after the show you put up yesterday,

10:33.770 --> 10:37.370
- we can't take any risks.
- She was about to bash you with a hammer.

10:37.570 --> 10:40.180
- You know that?
- Yeah, and I appreciate that.

10:40.840 --> 10:42.760
Son, don't worry about me.

10:44.140 --> 10:46.390
You're the only one that matters.

10:48.060 --> 10:49.390
It doesn't feel like it.

10:54.520 --> 10:56.650
Hold on a sec.

10:58.360 --> 11:00.070
FOR IAN

11:46.200 --> 11:47.560
I swear.

11:47.760 --> 11:49.120
It was a hailstorm.

11:49.750 --> 11:53.280
- There's never been a hailstorm here.
- That wasn't the weirdest part.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.780
I asked to see the footage from the car

11:55.980 --> 11:57.380
and the grocery shop.

11:59.130 --> 12:01.760
And the gas station CCTV footage.

12:02.380 --> 12:06.300
And you know what?
It had already been confiscated.

12:06.930 --> 12:09.040
"By your colleagues," they said.

12:09.240 --> 12:11.460
They were looking for the boy
and his father.

12:11.660 --> 12:12.940
Those bastards.

12:25.370 --> 12:26.530
Shit!

12:27.330 --> 12:28.580
Are you okay?

13:12.250 --> 13:13.830
<i>No, I'm looking for him.</i>

13:14.500 --> 13:15.330
<i>Bruce Hong.</i>

13:15.920 --> 13:17.440
<i>Your brother. Where is he?</i>

13:17.640 --> 13:19.290
<i>That's what I'd like to know.</i>

13:21.130 --> 13:24.030
<i>He is very busy, fighting overâ€¦</i>

13:24.230 --> 13:26.380
<i>- Bruce is Dragon Hong's brother.</i>
- Ian!

13:27.510 --> 13:30.330
Come, Bruce Lee's clone
is about to raise hell.

13:30.530 --> 13:33.540
<i>You seem very confident.</i>
<i>You are also kind.</i>

13:33.740 --> 13:35.810
<i>Of course. Even more than you.</i>

13:36.810 --> 13:38.060
Ian?

13:58.040 --> 14:00.590
Thank you for the trick you pulled
on the Civil Guard.

14:01.290 --> 14:03.860
The Agency
wouldn't have found you otherwise.

14:04.060 --> 14:05.340
The Agency?

14:06.090 --> 14:08.970
That sounds way too official
for an unofficial organization.

14:09.680 --> 14:11.710
Are you still calling them "perceivers"?

14:11.900 --> 14:14.060
Perceiver. Singular.

14:14.890 --> 14:15.850
There's just one left.

14:16.480 --> 14:19.060
And believe me, he's on his last legs.

14:20.110 --> 14:21.570
Where's the boy?

14:22.360 --> 14:24.440
I don't care what you do to me.

14:32.330 --> 14:34.080
I won't say it again.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.110
We have him.

14:39.310 --> 14:42.670
Three kilometers away.
His truck is at the arcade.

15:45.610 --> 15:47.360
Entering the arcade.

16:16.430 --> 16:17.680
Perceiver in the area.

16:18.810 --> 16:21.630
Perceiver in the area!
Awaiting orders and backup!

16:21.830 --> 16:23.190
Change of priorities.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.210
Catch the perceiver.

16:25.410 --> 16:27.980
We can't let him near the kid.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.660
Visual on the target.

16:53.800 --> 16:56.700
He's heading to the exit. Awaiting orders.

16:56.900 --> 16:57.970
<i>Go after him.</i>

17:23.080 --> 17:26.750
- Don't even look at him.
- You're not safe here. Let's go. Now!

18:24.560 --> 18:29.020
You've seen what that guy can do.
There are more like you, Ian.

18:30.770 --> 18:32.820
Come with me if you want to live.

19:20.530 --> 19:22.320
We don't have all night, kid.

19:23.580 --> 19:24.870
It's up to you.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.620
Dad...

19:38.810 --> 19:40.260
- Dad!
- Sit down.

19:40.720 --> 19:41.840
Dad!

19:42.300 --> 19:43.720
What are you doing?

19:45.470 --> 19:46.640
I'm sorry.

20:17.630 --> 20:20.550
We have the kid.
Sending samples for analysis.

20:51.160 --> 20:54.620
- The perceiver has blocked the road.
- Don't believe it. Carry on.

21:50.350 --> 21:52.350
Sorry about the helmet, Ian.

21:53.640 --> 21:55.940
I have to guarantee my team's safety.

21:57.020 --> 21:59.940
I'm Doctor Levin,
but you can call me Adriana.

22:00.440 --> 22:02.070
I don't care who you are.

22:02.610 --> 22:03.820
What am I doing here?

22:08.450 --> 22:09.950
Let's take a look at history.

22:10.700 --> 22:14.000
Don't you have the feeling
the world is getting worse?

22:16.080 --> 22:20.320
Each new government promises
change and hope when it's elected.

22:20.520 --> 22:23.630
But they end up doing
exactly the same as the previous one.

22:24.590 --> 22:26.920
They say one thing and do the opposite.

22:28.510 --> 22:31.850
The world we live in is defined by power.

22:32.600 --> 22:35.220
But real power can't be bought with money,

22:35.770 --> 22:38.520
knowledge or technology.

22:40.480 --> 22:44.690
It's achieved by being able
to create a lie and remain invisible.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.950
By making others believe
whatever you want.

22:49.200 --> 22:52.740
And, eventually,
if that doesn't lead to concrete action,

22:53.370 --> 22:56.270
making them do it against their will

22:56.470 --> 22:59.250
and redirecting the course of history.

23:00.330 --> 23:02.040
That's true power.

23:06.260 --> 23:07.920
We're at war, kid.

23:08.930 --> 23:10.430
Against the Awareness.

23:10.930 --> 23:12.450
I don't know what that is.

23:12.650 --> 23:15.770
An organization of people
with abilities like yours.

23:17.140 --> 23:21.300
They've been controlling
the spheres of power for years,

23:21.500 --> 23:25.180
manipulating the minds and decisions
of those in power.

23:25.370 --> 23:28.400
Leaders, politicians and the military.

23:29.150 --> 23:30.950
It doesn't matter who is in charge.

23:31.700 --> 23:34.850
In the end, they'll follow
the path laid by the Awareness.

23:35.050 --> 23:37.250
We're here to stop that from happening.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.040
To preserve the scant democracy
left in the world.

23:42.380 --> 23:44.170
What does that have to do with me?

23:44.920 --> 23:48.130
You're still alive
because we got to you before he did.

23:49.260 --> 23:50.220
Who was he?

23:52.260 --> 23:53.260
That man.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.390
A perceiver.

23:58.560 --> 24:00.730
- A what?
- A perceiver.

24:01.690 --> 24:04.560
The last one remaining
from the Awareness, we believe.

24:05.480 --> 24:07.470
He can project images, like you.

24:07.670 --> 24:09.240
And do a few other things.

24:10.110 --> 24:12.490
He's the most powerful we've faced.

24:13.070 --> 24:14.530
He wants you to join him.

24:15.280 --> 24:17.830
If you don't, he'll kill you.

24:19.790 --> 24:22.000
Great. Kill me.

24:26.340 --> 24:27.590
And what do you want?

24:34.550 --> 24:36.180
I want you to work with me.

24:39.270 --> 24:41.770
And also, the formula in your blood.

24:43.480 --> 24:44.520
What formula?

24:45.190 --> 24:48.110
The one that can create
or cancel your powers.

24:49.900 --> 24:51.490
What else can you project?

24:53.280 --> 24:54.530
Larger objects?

24:56.280 --> 24:57.280
Environments?

24:58.410 --> 24:59.370
People?

25:00.040 --> 25:03.830
People? I've tried it many times,
but it's not possible.

25:04.580 --> 25:05.500
It is possible.

25:06.080 --> 25:07.500
Where is my father?

25:08.040 --> 25:09.650
I don't want to hurt you, Ian.

25:09.850 --> 25:11.780
- Tell me where he is.
- Not yet.

25:11.980 --> 25:13.700
- Tell me.
- I want to help you.

25:13.900 --> 25:14.830
Where's my father?

25:15.030 --> 25:16.260
Sit down.

25:23.060 --> 25:26.310
First do something for me.
Then you can see your father.

25:27.190 --> 25:28.440
Show me what you can do.

25:29.480 --> 25:32.780
I want you to make me believe
I'm on the beach.

25:34.150 --> 25:35.450
It's sunny.

25:36.320 --> 25:37.780
White sand.

25:38.320 --> 25:40.030
Drinking a mojito.

25:40.580 --> 25:42.120
With a chihuahua by my side.

25:48.210 --> 25:50.540
Look, Doctor, it doesn't work that way.

25:51.920 --> 25:54.170
I can make you see something,

25:54.760 --> 25:56.450
but nothing as spectacular as that.

25:56.650 --> 25:59.850
Don't be afraid.
You can run before you walk.

26:01.350 --> 26:05.100
Emotions are a great way
to channel your powers.

26:05.850 --> 26:09.480
The more intense they are,
the bigger your ability to project.

26:10.310 --> 26:13.900
Find a strong emotion
and project it onto me.

26:14.780 --> 26:16.530
Look inside yourself.

26:17.820 --> 26:20.240
I'm sure you had a tough childhood, right?

26:21.830 --> 26:22.870
What do you mean?

26:23.660 --> 26:25.620
I've been looking for you for years.

26:26.750 --> 26:29.250
But Vicente managed to hide you.

26:30.580 --> 26:33.000
I imagine you've gone from town to town.

26:34.210 --> 26:35.260
No schooling.

26:36.170 --> 26:37.170
No friends.

26:43.640 --> 26:44.640
No mother.

27:12.380 --> 27:13.710
Now the chihuahua.

27:23.470 --> 27:24.680
A fly?

27:25.260 --> 27:26.270
Really?

27:27.180 --> 27:30.850
Now I want to go home
and have the fly follow me in a loop.

27:32.520 --> 27:34.570
A projection, but forever.

27:35.150 --> 27:37.440
The subject won't even know it's not real.

27:38.030 --> 27:40.450
Like a sick person
who sees things others can't.

27:41.030 --> 27:44.030
My reality will constantly
include that loop.

27:58.300 --> 28:00.420
Your free trial is over.

28:02.390 --> 28:03.550
If you want more,

28:04.350 --> 28:05.470
I want to see my father.

28:10.180 --> 28:11.190
Dad!

28:12.850 --> 28:13.770
Dad!

28:14.270 --> 28:15.360
Are you okay?

28:16.610 --> 28:17.610
Help me.

28:17.980 --> 28:19.780
- Help me, son.
- Did they hit you?

28:20.690 --> 28:22.360
You should look after yourself.

28:22.820 --> 28:24.120
You're no longer a kid.

28:24.490 --> 28:25.620
Hold on.

28:26.330 --> 28:27.490
You know each other?

28:28.490 --> 28:29.790
Find out for yourself.

28:30.580 --> 28:32.040
Go into his memories.

28:32.830 --> 28:34.000
What?

28:34.580 --> 28:36.210
Don't you ever

28:36.790 --> 28:39.920
suddenly feel invaded by bits
of someone else's life?

28:40.590 --> 28:42.300
You could control that.

28:43.050 --> 28:46.580
See what those memories hold
and go through them.

28:46.780 --> 28:48.100
It's the second power.

28:48.560 --> 28:52.460
You might find blank spaces.
You'll learn to avoid them.

28:52.660 --> 28:56.090
Ian, don't listen to her.
They just want to run tests on you.

28:56.290 --> 28:58.300
I'm offering him the truth.

28:58.500 --> 29:00.690
- What is she talking about?
- Don't listen!

29:02.030 --> 29:03.640
Everything they say is a lie.

29:03.840 --> 29:05.700
Why are you afraid, then?

29:06.280 --> 29:08.870
Go in and find out who this woman is.

29:11.750 --> 29:12.750
Adriana...

29:13.870 --> 29:15.620
I'm begging you, please.

29:18.210 --> 29:19.300
Ian, please.

29:21.960 --> 29:22.990
Please.

29:23.190 --> 29:25.510
This will only make it worse.

29:26.050 --> 29:27.470
I'm begging you!

30:06.840 --> 30:08.700
Vicente, what are you doing?

30:08.900 --> 30:10.260
Leave him. He's not yours.

30:22.190 --> 30:23.650
What the fuck was that?

30:24.360 --> 30:25.240
Did you see her?

30:26.200 --> 30:28.860
No. I've only seen you and Dad.

30:31.240 --> 30:32.410
And a baby.

30:33.160 --> 30:34.250
He took it.

30:36.460 --> 30:37.710
It was me.

30:39.880 --> 30:41.130
That baby was me.

30:46.340 --> 30:47.550
He's not my father.

30:50.180 --> 30:51.350
That's right, Ian.

30:52.810 --> 30:54.010
He ran away with you.

30:57.140 --> 30:59.650
I understand this might be hard for you.

31:04.530 --> 31:06.400
But your mother might still be alive.

33:13.240 --> 33:14.360
Get up, kid.

33:15.740 --> 33:17.240
Have you seen where you are?

33:18.030 --> 33:19.620
You're a lab rat.

33:20.040 --> 33:22.250
And you know what they do to those.

33:23.290 --> 33:25.290
We have to get out. Can you fight?

33:32.590 --> 33:33.970
Here you go, Doctor.

33:35.300 --> 33:36.390
Thanks.

33:40.350 --> 33:41.350
Doctor.

33:43.350 --> 33:45.060
We have to repeat the tests.

33:46.650 --> 33:48.310
The NTF had an invalid value.

33:49.310 --> 33:50.440
And it'd be nice...

33:52.440 --> 33:53.990
As I was saying, the kid...

33:54.740 --> 33:58.780
You should know we had never administered

33:59.320 --> 34:00.950
such high doses before.

34:04.500 --> 34:07.170
Okay, I'll be back in a while.

34:13.630 --> 34:17.680
NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR: 204%

34:29.860 --> 34:30.860
Come on!

35:31.500 --> 35:32.380
Let's go!

35:56.230 --> 35:57.280
What are you waiting for?

36:04.580 --> 36:05.740
Hold on a moment.

36:06.950 --> 36:08.700
We can't leave without my father.

36:09.660 --> 36:12.170
You've seen he's not your father.
Leave him.

36:12.830 --> 36:13.960
He's useless.

36:15.170 --> 36:16.420
He can be of use.

36:21.840 --> 36:23.640
My answers are in his memories.

36:35.940 --> 36:37.230
Sound the alarms!

36:37.820 --> 36:39.360
Close the perimeter.

36:39.820 --> 36:41.110
Cover access points!

37:01.050 --> 37:01.820
These.

37:02.020 --> 37:04.090
- Give them to me.
- No. I'll drive.

37:25.240 --> 37:27.020
Duck, son. Buckle up.

37:27.220 --> 37:28.200
Don't call me son.

37:31.240 --> 37:33.980
You finally did it. You got into my head!

37:34.180 --> 37:35.500
Yes, I got into your head!

37:37.880 --> 37:39.000
Watch out!

37:40.000 --> 37:41.610
I wanted to tell you.

37:41.810 --> 37:43.970
But it's not easy. It's not!

37:50.680 --> 37:52.670
What are you doing? Go to your office.

37:52.870 --> 37:54.100
The boy has escaped.

38:15.580 --> 38:17.750
Shoot to kill. Orders from above.

38:37.390 --> 38:39.440
Ian, please, we already lost them.

38:51.780 --> 38:52.700
Watch out!

40:13.990 --> 40:15.490
Careful.

40:16.030 --> 40:17.790
There you go. Come on.

40:23.790 --> 40:24.790
Ester.

40:27.170 --> 40:28.170
Come here.

40:46.730 --> 40:47.940
Why are you helping me?

40:50.740 --> 40:51.950
I can either help you...

40:53.780 --> 40:54.820
or kill you.

40:58.620 --> 41:01.160
Lighten up, kid.
I still haven't killed you.

41:09.380 --> 41:10.840
Can you also...

41:13.260 --> 41:14.470
do mind tricks?

41:21.390 --> 41:23.480
You work for the Resistance, right?

41:24.190 --> 41:25.770
The Awareness.

41:27.360 --> 41:29.690
And no, I can't do mind tricks.

42:01.100 --> 42:02.220
Do you like this song?

42:06.730 --> 42:07.940
I like the classics.

42:14.440 --> 42:17.930
One time Vicente caught me
doing pranks on the overpass.

42:18.130 --> 42:22.240
I was watching cars avoid
the balls I was projecting.

42:22.870 --> 42:24.910
He taught me to sprinkle them.

42:27.250 --> 42:28.960
You mean spit on them.

42:31.590 --> 42:32.630
Yeah, right.

42:34.170 --> 42:35.970
It turns out he's not my dad.

42:52.480 --> 42:53.980
Actually, it's ironic.

42:56.740 --> 42:59.740
I thought I was the one
creating illusions for everyone.

43:00.450 --> 43:01.450
What an idiot.

43:04.540 --> 43:07.160
The world was creating illusions for me.

43:13.420 --> 43:16.970
Ian, what makes you different
makes you strong.

43:18.380 --> 43:22.390
I get that it's not easy,
but being unique isn't bad.

43:24.510 --> 43:27.310
You have to believe in yourself
and follow your gut.

43:28.100 --> 43:30.810
And when that happens,
they better be ready.

43:32.060 --> 43:33.400
You'll be unstoppable.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.210
- The song is over.
- Yeah.

43:54.880 --> 43:56.000
Let's talk!

44:01.930 --> 44:03.050
Motherfucker.

44:07.930 --> 44:10.600
Look, I know that deep down you love him.

44:11.810 --> 44:14.110
But he's a drunk and a liability.

44:14.610 --> 44:17.180
- That's bullshit.
- I don't like to argue.

44:17.380 --> 44:18.550
It's just a fact.

44:18.750 --> 44:20.950
- What do you want me to do?
- I don't know.

44:21.320 --> 44:22.700
You wanted him here.

44:23.200 --> 44:24.870
I want to know who I am.

44:26.790 --> 44:27.950
What I am.

44:32.080 --> 44:33.580
What are you waiting for?

44:35.170 --> 44:37.250
Go in there and find the answers.

45:12.750 --> 45:15.250
You can go in and measure the subject.

45:16.330 --> 45:18.500
I bet the big boss asked you personally.

45:20.420 --> 45:22.590
I bet the big boss asked you personally.

45:24.430 --> 45:28.720
12K WOJDYNSKA STREET,
WARSAW, POLAND

45:45.070 --> 45:48.120
Kominski wants
to give him the formula tonight.

46:03.590 --> 46:06.340
Kominski wants
to give him the formula tonight.

46:24.990 --> 46:27.700
Ian. What did you see?

46:42.750 --> 46:45.220
Good morning. How may I help you?

46:54.930 --> 46:56.520
In small bills.

46:57.640 --> 47:00.730
- Please.
- We don't have this much money.

47:01.360 --> 47:04.320
To withdraw 50,000 euros
you have to give notice.

47:06.030 --> 47:07.030
Please wait here.

47:07.530 --> 47:08.910
Hold on.

47:11.120 --> 47:12.700
I think you read it wrong.

47:14.080 --> 47:15.290
I wish it were 50,000.

47:18.580 --> 47:21.710
Five thousand. That's different.

47:23.920 --> 47:27.470
- All right, sign here and here.
- Okay.

47:48.990 --> 47:50.110
Five thousand.

47:50.660 --> 47:51.910
In small bills.

48:00.790 --> 48:01.830
Thank you.

48:02.290 --> 48:03.330
You're welcome.

48:08.260 --> 48:09.720
I'M SORRY

48:11.630 --> 48:12.640
Security!

48:13.140 --> 48:14.800
Security! Get that boy!

48:16.010 --> 48:17.170
Run.

48:17.370 --> 48:18.930
Run!

48:19.730 --> 48:20.730
Stop right there!

48:23.730 --> 48:24.730
Stop!

48:29.780 --> 48:32.860
That was fucking awesome!

48:33.910 --> 48:35.700
He won't like it one bit.

48:37.200 --> 48:38.750
I've always wanted to do this.

48:40.580 --> 48:41.710
Stop, stop!

48:43.370 --> 48:44.580
Where's Vicente?

48:46.000 --> 48:46.880
Here.

48:47.420 --> 48:49.550
He's probably at the bar. You know.

49:21.080 --> 49:22.080
Stay here.

50:23.810 --> 50:26.560
Projections don't work on mirrors
or with me, Ian.

50:30.770 --> 50:34.510
I see Adriana has done a good job
setting you against me. Calm down.

50:34.710 --> 50:35.820
I am calm!

50:53.500 --> 50:54.800
Calm down.

50:55.550 --> 50:58.930
- I'm here to help you.
- I don't need your help.

51:06.230 --> 51:07.230
Get up!

51:08.020 --> 51:09.350
Relax! Look at me.

51:10.150 --> 51:12.940
Calm down! Breathe.

51:37.630 --> 51:40.840
Don't you think it's strange the Agency
is no longer after you?

51:41.510 --> 51:44.260
It was me. I got rid of them for you.

51:45.310 --> 51:47.890
We're on the same side, Ian. Trust me.

51:59.200 --> 52:00.570
This is for your own good.

52:05.790 --> 52:06.830
<i>Stop, stop!</i>

52:07.160 --> 52:08.980
<i>That was fucking awesome!</i>

52:09.180 --> 52:10.440
<i>Run!</i>

52:10.640 --> 52:11.860
<i>Security! Get that boy!</i>

52:12.060 --> 52:13.400
<i>I want to know who I am.</i>

52:13.600 --> 52:15.340
<i>What I am.</i>

52:16.630 --> 52:18.110
<i>What are you waiting for?</i>

52:18.310 --> 52:20.420
<i>Go in there and find the answers.</i>

52:21.930 --> 52:25.960
<i>The scientist is currently retired</i>
<i>and lives in the outskirts of Warsaw.</i>

52:26.160 --> 52:28.810
...in the outskirts of Warsaw.

52:29.850 --> 52:31.390
It's our only option.

52:40.110 --> 52:41.610
I'll see you soon.

52:58.420 --> 52:59.670
Ian.

53:00.090 --> 53:01.590
What happened here?

53:03.340 --> 53:04.220
Ian!

53:05.430 --> 53:06.300
Come.

53:08.890 --> 53:10.730
Can't you see how serious this is?

53:13.480 --> 53:14.900
Everyone's talking about it.

53:16.150 --> 53:17.190
It's all your fault.

53:20.740 --> 53:23.820
If you had told me the truth,
we wouldn't be here.

53:27.070 --> 53:29.990
Besides, we need money.

53:31.750 --> 53:32.870
What for?

53:36.000 --> 53:37.210
We're going to Warsaw.

53:39.590 --> 53:42.260
Why the heck do you want to go to Warsaw?

53:42.970 --> 53:44.970
You know damn well what's in Warsaw.

53:49.850 --> 53:50.850
Kominski.

53:52.060 --> 53:54.940
- You've gotten into my head again.
- Yeah, I did.

53:55.140 --> 53:57.520
You've had chances
to tell me your secrets.

53:58.190 --> 53:59.690
But you always choose not to.

54:00.940 --> 54:02.570
What is it? You don't trust me?

54:03.360 --> 54:04.490
Trust you?

54:06.070 --> 54:08.700
How the fuck am I supposed to trust you?

54:09.120 --> 54:10.980
You've been lying to me my whole life!

54:11.180 --> 54:13.500
- I was going to tell you!
- You kidnapped me!

54:16.000 --> 54:17.540
You took me from my parents.

54:18.290 --> 54:20.340
And forced me to lead your shitty life.

54:22.300 --> 54:24.010
You've turned me into a wretch.

54:25.800 --> 54:26.880
Just like you.

54:32.350 --> 54:33.810
And the balloons?

54:39.360 --> 54:41.270
What the hell was that?

54:43.730 --> 54:46.300
Did you have fun telling me that bullshit?

54:46.500 --> 54:48.410
Everything I've done was for you.

54:48.910 --> 54:50.570
It's not so hard to understand.

54:51.280 --> 54:54.290
- But if you break the rules...
- What rules?

54:56.500 --> 54:58.750
No playing tricks on "family"?

54:59.170 --> 55:02.040
- No.
- No? Because you're not my father!

55:02.590 --> 55:03.490
Let's calm down.

55:03.690 --> 55:06.780
Isolating you from the world
was my way of protecting you.

55:06.980 --> 55:11.220
- I know I wasn't the perfect father...
- You're not my father!

55:19.190 --> 55:20.350
You're right.

55:21.560 --> 55:22.770
I'm not your father.

55:25.690 --> 55:26.900
But you are my son.

55:34.040 --> 55:35.290
Listen to me,

55:37.000 --> 55:38.790
because I can only say this once.

55:42.710 --> 55:43.960
You have two options.

55:45.670 --> 55:49.840
Continue on this path, which I guarantee
will only bring you pain.

55:51.140 --> 55:52.180
And suffering.

55:52.890 --> 55:54.140
Or come with me.

55:56.470 --> 55:59.000
And make a fresh start.

55:59.200 --> 56:01.770
You and I. Alone.

56:02.480 --> 56:04.400
Together. Like at the beginning.

56:36.850 --> 56:40.230
- Yes?
<i>- We have him. He's bought train tickets.</i>

56:40.980 --> 56:42.560
Activate the protocol.

57:02.750 --> 57:05.790
WARSAW

57:22.520 --> 57:23.770
All right.

57:46.380 --> 57:47.790
<i>Affirmative. They're here.</i>

57:54.760 --> 57:56.010
It feels like home.

58:03.980 --> 58:05.690
It looks like no one lives here.

58:06.230 --> 58:09.320
- So why are you whispering?
- I don't know.

58:46.850 --> 58:48.100
There's nothing here.

58:49.230 --> 58:50.480
Or no one.

58:58.660 --> 59:00.490
We're back to square one.

59:01.660 --> 59:02.910
To ground zero.

59:04.160 --> 59:05.160
What?

59:07.670 --> 59:10.080
"Ground zero" sounds cooler.

59:15.920 --> 59:17.470
The room from my dreams.

59:21.350 --> 59:23.430
I spent hours playing with my mom here.

59:25.560 --> 59:27.430
I remember a bunny that...

59:31.560 --> 59:33.020
I remember it bigger.

59:34.730 --> 59:36.820
You can't have memories from that age.

59:37.860 --> 59:38.860
Something is off.

59:40.360 --> 59:44.030
What's off is that in my dreams
it was bigger.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.120
Memory doesn't work like you think.

59:51.290 --> 59:53.490
An image can spark a memory.

59:53.690 --> 59:55.000
But, a kid that young?

59:55.800 --> 59:58.380
- How old were you?
- One year old or so.

01:01:00.570 --> 01:01:01.610
It's her journals.

01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:11.330
It's her.

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:16.590
It's always the same dream.

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:19.550
I'm in that white room.

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:24.180
And she always sings.

01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:43.530
Her name is Urszula.

01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:46.410
Urszula Kominski.

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:50.740
You're Kominski's grandson.

01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:43.300
Drinking won't help you forget.

01:02:44.090 --> 01:02:46.010
Is that how you fix everything?

01:02:48.970 --> 01:02:51.560
Last time you weren't so nice.
What do you want?

01:02:51.970 --> 01:02:53.970
We know Ian is flying solo now.

01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:56.770
Tracking him has been easy.

01:02:58.350 --> 01:02:59.900
If we can find him...

01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:03.610
so can the perceiver.

01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:05.900
If you wanted to help him, you could...

01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:09.780
- just leave him alone.
- It's not that easy.

01:03:11.370 --> 01:03:13.100
Ian is the only person

01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:16.110
who could face The Mule.
He's our only hope.

01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:18.750
Look at you.

01:03:19.710 --> 01:03:23.130
After all these years
you're still going on about The Mule.

01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:26.470
No man's land.

01:03:27.050 --> 01:03:28.260
That's what I chose.

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:30.390
The Awareness on one side,

01:03:30.970 --> 01:03:34.310
the Agency on the other,
and the kid and me in the middle.

01:03:36.810 --> 01:03:38.560
Not letting either side sway us.

01:03:39.730 --> 01:03:41.650
He's following his own path.

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:45.980
I have to respect that.

01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:48.360
Ian is no longer protected.

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:52.820
He's alone, lost, and easily manipulated.

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:55.580
Meanwhile, you stay in the middle.

01:04:10.590 --> 01:04:12.330
You should stop drinking

01:04:12.530 --> 01:04:15.810
and become a real father for once.

01:04:23.690 --> 01:04:25.940
I'm sure there's a clue somewhere in here.

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:32.780
Ester?

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:41.570
But... What are you doing?

01:04:41.770 --> 01:04:43.960
- Helping you.
- Helping me?

01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:46.780
- What is this?
- You wanted answers.

01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:48.630
Listen to what he has to say.

01:04:51.130 --> 01:04:52.220
Stay back.

01:04:53.550 --> 01:04:56.050
- I don't want to hurt you.
- Stop!

01:04:57.010 --> 01:04:58.250
I just want to talk.

01:04:58.450 --> 01:05:00.430
Well, I don't. Go!

01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:02.890
Stop, I said!

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:04.440
Stop!

01:06:23.310 --> 01:06:24.940
This one is real.

01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:29.690
If I wanted to kill you, I'd do it now.
Hands down.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:37.240
I know you're looking for your parents.

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:41.700
I've been looking for you, son.

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:44.040
You?

01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:47.500
I don't believe a word you say.

01:07:08.770 --> 01:07:10.150
<i>We're a product, Ian.</i>

01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:12.020
A creation.

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:16.190
Fruit of a secret program
created in the 1950s, after World War II.

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:19.390
There was a group of volunteers.

01:07:19.590 --> 01:07:20.780
Like your mom and me.

01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:24.330
Kominski injected us
with a compound that he created.

01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:28.040
- The formula.
- Yes.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:33.670
Thanks to the formula,
we developed extrasensory abilities.

01:07:35.420 --> 01:07:37.670
We're spies capable of mental control.

01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:42.870
After the Cold War,
they didn't know what to do with us.

01:07:43.070 --> 01:07:45.020
They feared we might regroup

01:07:46.350 --> 01:07:48.350
or form an alliance with an enemy.

01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:53.690
They decided to exterminate us.

01:07:55.690 --> 01:07:57.490
They called it The Disinfection.

01:07:59.650 --> 01:08:01.490
<i>They hunted us one by one.</i>

01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:03.870
<i>Like rabbits.</i>

01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:07.080
<i>We had no hope.</i>

01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:17.550
Until The Mule appeared.

01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:22.720
<i>He's the last and strongest</i>
<i>of the perceivers.</i>

01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:24.930
<i>The perfect weapon.</i>

01:08:29.270 --> 01:08:31.710
<i>When they went after him, The Mule</i>

01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:33.020
<i>counterattacked.</i>

01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:46.100
<i>A few days before The Disinfection,</i>

01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:51.160
<i>they'd detected signs of a new ability</i>
<i>that made the Agency tremble.</i>

01:08:52.330 --> 01:08:54.080
<i>The third power.</i>

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:56.380
<i>Complete subjugation.</i>

01:08:57.090 --> 01:08:58.960
<i>Being able to bend anyone's will.</i>

01:08:59.710 --> 01:09:03.430
<i>Make them do what you want,</i>
<i>how you want it, when you want it,</i>

01:09:03.930 --> 01:09:05.180
<i>wherever you want it.</i>

01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:08.680
<i>Like a puppeteer.</i>

01:09:10.850 --> 01:09:12.810
He regrouped the survivors.

01:09:13.270 --> 01:09:14.690
And created the Awareness.

01:09:15.270 --> 01:09:19.280
He gave us guidelines to go unnoticed
without having to use our powers.

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:23.490
Why "The Mule"?

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:25.990
We perceivers, like mules,

01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:28.060
<i>are sterile.</i>

01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:31.020
Governments made sure it was that way.

01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:33.650
But I'm the son of two perceivers.

01:09:33.850 --> 01:09:37.130
You are. And that's the miracle.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.300
It was impossible. Your mother and I
had been together for years.

01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:44.120
And suddenly one day,

01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:45.840
she realized she was pregnant.

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:51.270
The first natural perceiver
was going to be born.

01:09:51.850 --> 01:09:53.180
No fucking way.

01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:13.710
After me. Go to the roof. I'll cover you.

01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:16.460
I don't believe a word.

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:18.250
Stop lying to me.

01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:20.550
Where is my mother?

01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:24.120
Hey, I don't like to argue.

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:27.720
Go back to Spain.
I have a house in Madrid. She knows where.

01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:32.100
Good.

01:10:33.930 --> 01:10:35.020
Trust us.

01:11:32.910 --> 01:11:34.040
Stay here.

01:13:16.850 --> 01:13:18.430
There's no emergency ladder.

01:13:18.850 --> 01:13:19.890
There!

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:33.280
Ian, we don't have time.

01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:35.450
Ester!

01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:48.800
Come on!

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:46.140
You will all regret this.

01:14:47.150 --> 01:14:48.190
All of you!

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.810
It almost worked out for you.

01:15:06.010 --> 01:15:10.530
Letting me find the kid
so you could catch us both.

01:15:10.730 --> 01:15:12.500
It's called strategy.

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:15.380
You might have powers,

01:15:16.090 --> 01:15:19.050
but we have brain and muscle.

01:15:20.050 --> 01:15:24.060
And we'll soon know if you're The Mule
or if it's just a legend.

01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:27.340
Then you'll tell us where the kid went.

01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:29.850
And if I don't? What will you do to me?

01:15:30.270 --> 01:15:31.480
Will you kill me?

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:33.440
No.

01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:35.900
Not yet.

01:15:37.490 --> 01:15:40.820
As soon as I have the formula,
I'll strip you of your powers.

01:15:41.490 --> 01:15:42.990
And then,

01:15:43.490 --> 01:15:45.410
you'll beg me to kill you.

01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:49.150
Adriana,

01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:52.130
wasn't sterilizing me enough, you bitch?

01:15:52.630 --> 01:15:54.170
Start the tests.

01:15:55.340 --> 01:15:56.570
Listen to yourself!

01:15:56.770 --> 01:15:58.530
You talk just like Kominski!

01:15:58.730 --> 01:16:00.180
I want that formula.

01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:14.210
Doctor.

01:17:16.170 --> 01:17:17.340
Bad news.

01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:19.840
The formula...

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:23.630
It's so diluted in his body

01:17:24.970 --> 01:17:26.640
it's impossible to synthesize.

01:17:28.430 --> 01:17:29.520
I'm thirsty!

01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:32.100
Can I get some water?

01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:35.360
It's really hot in here, motherfuckers.

01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:35.000
Keep your mouth open.

01:19:27.010 --> 01:19:28.130
What are you doing, Doctor?

01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:31.370
Return the robot to its initial position.

01:19:31.570 --> 01:19:32.790
Deactivate the robot now.

01:19:32.990 --> 01:19:34.830
He's controlling my movements.

01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:38.100
Remove your hand from the joystick.
I won't say it again!

01:19:38.850 --> 01:19:40.610
Remove your hand from the joystick!

01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:46.270
This way.

01:21:53.860 --> 01:21:55.240
She likes being sung to.

01:22:34.650 --> 01:22:36.030
Mom.

01:22:36.990 --> 01:22:39.060
You must have imagined this moment

01:22:39.260 --> 01:22:40.580
a million times.

01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:44.000
And I'm sorry

01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:47.120
it's not like you imagined.

01:22:49.170 --> 01:22:51.070
But your mother isn't gone, Ian.

01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:52.880
She's still in there, somewhere.

01:22:54.590 --> 01:22:56.380
And you can reunite there.

01:23:01.850 --> 01:23:02.850
Mom.

01:23:45.810 --> 01:23:47.640
Ian, look at your mother.

01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:52.190
This is what they do to our kind.

01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:55.190
Before being caught,

01:23:55.860 --> 01:23:58.110
Urszula managed
to implant a memory in you.

01:23:58.990 --> 01:24:00.320
This memory.

01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:04.660
She knew they couldn't create
perceivers without the formula.

01:24:06.250 --> 01:24:08.410
She destroyed Kominski's only copy.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.840
And encrypted the original in your memory.

01:24:14.710 --> 01:24:15.550
Ian.

01:24:18.170 --> 01:24:22.250
With that formula,
we could create new perceivers.

01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:26.290
And put an end once and for all
to that Agency that has hurt

01:24:26.490 --> 01:24:27.670
you,

01:24:27.870 --> 01:24:29.100
me,

01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:30.940
and your mom.

01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:36.900
Ian.

01:24:41.450 --> 01:24:43.060
You can't get them yourself?

01:24:43.260 --> 01:24:45.660
There's no time, son. Give them to me.

01:24:46.580 --> 01:24:48.120
She didn't want anyone to see them.

01:24:53.460 --> 01:24:54.340
Just me.

01:25:00.550 --> 01:25:01.830
Ian, give me the blocks!

01:25:02.030 --> 01:25:04.350
So I can protect you from the Agency!

01:25:08.430 --> 01:25:09.640
Stop!

01:25:14.150 --> 01:25:15.270
Stop!

01:25:17.980 --> 01:25:19.530
Stop, you'll hurt her!

01:27:01.130 --> 01:27:02.500
Step away from the boy!

01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:43.050
There it is.

01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:45.300
The third power.

01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:47.170
I knew it.

01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:02.230
Ian!

01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:04.400
Ian!

01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:12.530
I can't move.

01:28:17.250 --> 01:28:18.080
Ian.

01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:27.300
What are you doing?

01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:07.840
Ian, stop.

01:29:13.010 --> 01:29:16.010
Stop, Ian. Don't make me do it.

01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:30.400
Open fire!

01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:32.930
Shoot!

01:29:33.130 --> 01:29:34.070
It's a direct order!

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:48.090
I just saw it.

01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:51.030
No, Ian, stop. What did you see?

01:29:51.230 --> 01:29:53.260
- Is she alive?
- Do it, son.

01:29:54.050 --> 01:29:55.970
She's responsible for this.

01:29:57.640 --> 01:29:59.870
We lost her many years ago.

01:30:00.070 --> 01:30:02.420
Whatever you saw is his doing!

01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:03.690
You're lying!

01:30:04.980 --> 01:30:07.900
You'll pay for everything
you did to my mother.

01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:09.610
For opening her head.

01:30:11.150 --> 01:30:12.550
Like a lab rat.

01:30:12.750 --> 01:30:14.360
No, Ian...

01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:16.120
Do it.

01:30:16.570 --> 01:30:18.330
- Do it!
- Ian!

01:30:21.870 --> 01:30:22.870
You.

01:30:24.620 --> 01:30:25.580
You're with them.

01:30:28.540 --> 01:30:30.460
Don't do it. You have to stop.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.380
Don't interfere.

01:30:33.970 --> 01:30:35.010
Son...

01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:38.000
He's manipulating you, look.

01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:39.960
He treats you like a puppet.

01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:42.100
- He treats you like a child.
- Shut up!

01:30:42.770 --> 01:30:43.600
Leave me alone!

01:30:56.240 --> 01:30:58.810
Make him do the same thing as the rest!

01:30:59.010 --> 01:31:01.990
Don't do it,
you'll regret it your whole life.

01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:03.410
Take a look.

01:31:11.590 --> 01:31:13.380
Look at them, they're terrified!

01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:18.890
Go.

01:31:22.180 --> 01:31:23.520
The Agency...

01:31:26.020 --> 01:31:29.150
tortured my mother
until she turned into a vegetable.

01:31:30.900 --> 01:31:32.690
Just to get the formula.

01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:35.320
And destroy us.

01:31:39.570 --> 01:31:40.740
Ian...

01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:43.950
Look around you. Is this what you want?

01:31:44.660 --> 01:31:46.710
Don't let him control you like always.

01:31:47.330 --> 01:31:50.580
Think about your life.
No family, no friends.

01:31:51.170 --> 01:31:52.840
Son, now you have the chance

01:31:53.380 --> 01:31:55.840
to do something big. Don't listen to him.

01:31:57.050 --> 01:31:59.640
He's a drunk. Listen to your father!

01:32:00.390 --> 01:32:01.510
Father...

01:32:02.510 --> 01:32:04.460
A father is the man who raises you.

01:32:04.660 --> 01:32:07.480
Who gives you everything
and makes sacrifices...

01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:18.700
What have you done?

01:32:32.630 --> 01:32:34.000
Ian!

01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:46.790
No.

01:32:46.990 --> 01:32:48.130
No, no.

01:32:48.330 --> 01:32:50.390
No, no, no.

01:32:52.810 --> 01:32:56.020
If I go in, you won't survive.

01:32:57.400 --> 01:32:59.700
No.

01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:04.280
See... See for yourself.

01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:23.220
You're not like the others.

01:33:23.890 --> 01:33:25.180
I can feel your pain.

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:27.890
- Let go, please.
- He's here.

01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:30.390
He wants to take him away.

01:33:31.180 --> 01:33:33.060
Don't let them hurt him.

01:33:33.810 --> 01:33:36.760
You have to take him. Promise me you will!

01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:40.150
Please! The child deserves a future!

01:34:02.550 --> 01:34:04.010
Forgive me.

01:34:12.270 --> 01:34:16.860
- Dad. Forgive me.
- Don't worry.

01:34:23.070 --> 01:34:25.030
I'm the one who should apologize.

01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:27.780
You gave up your life...

01:34:31.290 --> 01:34:32.660
so I could have one.

01:34:35.710 --> 01:34:37.630
<i>Yes, but I was wrong.</i>

01:34:39.420 --> 01:34:41.000
<i>I never should've lied to you.</i>

01:34:42.710 --> 01:34:43.760
<i>But you...</i>

01:34:45.050 --> 01:34:47.300
<i>You can find your own path.</i>

01:34:55.940 --> 01:34:57.630
<i>Are they not coming today?</i>

01:34:57.830 --> 01:35:01.610
You have to be patient,
like when we played hide-and-seek.

01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:05.570
- What if the fish are all gone?
- Ian.

01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:08.930
Come on! How can they all be gone?

01:35:09.130 --> 01:35:11.350
Can't you see how big the sea is?
See the end?

01:35:11.550 --> 01:35:13.870
Yeah, the line is the end.

01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:17.730
Listen. Just because
you can't see further,

01:35:17.930 --> 01:35:20.250
it doesn't mean something doesn't exist.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.760
Behind that line there's still much more.

01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:25.920
A lot more.

01:35:28.010 --> 01:35:30.430
So never give up. Okay?

01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:34.330
Who are the best fish for?

01:35:34.530 --> 01:35:37.140
- For those who keep their hopes up.
- That's right.

01:36:10.470 --> 01:36:11.760
Dad.

01:36:13.850 --> 01:36:16.140
Dad...

01:37:08.690 --> 01:37:09.900
Ian!

01:37:42.140 --> 01:37:43.730
Stop. Don't move.

01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:06.630
You're strong, son.

01:38:07.750 --> 01:38:09.130
But you haven't mastered it.

01:38:09.670 --> 01:38:11.090
I can see it in your eyes.

01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:19.510
Take it easy.

01:38:26.690 --> 01:38:27.690
Relax.

01:41:22.860 --> 01:41:24.450
One more step and I'll kill her.

01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:32.540
Do what he says, Ian.

01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:36.000
You took advantage of me.

01:41:37.050 --> 01:41:38.380
Like everybody else!

01:41:40.590 --> 01:41:42.180
You only care about the formula.

01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:43.930
Pretty much.

01:41:44.550 --> 01:41:48.180
Let me see it in your mind
and I'll go without hurting her.

01:41:48.810 --> 01:41:50.420
She has nothing to do with this!

01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:53.600
She? Don't listen to him!

01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:58.360
Whoever she is, she's a projection.
He's put a loop into your head.

01:42:00.110 --> 01:42:01.240
What are you saying?

01:42:01.780 --> 01:42:05.770
I can't see her. No one else sees her.
Only you can see her!

01:42:05.970 --> 01:42:08.560
That's a lie. She's playing tricks on you.

01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:12.540
- She said it was impossible.
- Be careful with what you decide.

01:42:13.250 --> 01:42:14.500
Whatever you do,

01:42:15.710 --> 01:42:17.090
there's no going back.

01:42:21.170 --> 01:42:23.550
Should I pull the trigger
to see if she's real?

01:42:24.590 --> 01:42:25.970
This is between you and me.

01:42:26.550 --> 01:42:28.140
Ian, try to remember.

01:42:28.890 --> 01:42:31.100
He had to plant the loop at some point.

01:43:42.300 --> 01:43:43.380
Ian.

01:43:44.090 --> 01:43:46.630
Drop your weapon.
Please, I don't want to die.

01:43:47.590 --> 01:43:48.800
Shut up!

01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:51.050
I don't want to hear you.

01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:53.220
Look at me.

01:43:54.310 --> 01:43:55.850
I know you feel the same way.

01:43:57.810 --> 01:44:00.260
- Is that not real?
- No. You're not real!

01:44:00.450 --> 01:44:02.970
No. You're just in my head.

01:44:03.170 --> 01:44:04.320
Are you sure?

01:44:04.980 --> 01:44:06.820
- Ian.
- That's a strong bet, son.

01:44:27.170 --> 01:44:28.380
I am not

01:44:29.340 --> 01:44:30.300
your son.

01:45:38.330 --> 01:45:40.120
This was just the beginning.

01:45:42.500 --> 01:45:44.040
I've already lost too much.

01:45:47.670 --> 01:45:50.010
The only people who cared about me.

01:45:57.060 --> 01:45:58.850
And 18 years I want to get back.

01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:10.990
We need the formula, Ian.

01:46:11.570 --> 01:46:13.150
We need you.

01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:17.030
The fate of a lot of people
depends on this war.

01:46:17.910 --> 01:46:19.160
Innocent people.

01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:22.330
You can't sit on the fence.

01:46:29.090 --> 01:46:31.460
You have to decide which side you're on.

01:46:36.590 --> 01:46:37.890
No man's land.

01:46:40.140 --> 01:46:41.930
Does it ring a bell, Doctor?

01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:52.940
You didn't have to do this.

01:46:53.570 --> 01:46:55.280
You just had to ask.

01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:03.620
I'll think about it.

01:47:19.050 --> 01:47:20.710
FOR IAN

01:47:20.910 --> 01:47:22.810
My dad gave it to me for my birthday.

01:47:23.770 --> 01:47:25.560
What are you waiting for?

01:47:36.820 --> 01:47:38.530
<i>The Majesty of the Ocean.</i>

01:47:42.580 --> 01:47:47.370
THE BEST FISH ARE FOR THOSE
WHO KEEP THEIR HOPES UP. I LOVE YOU.

01:47:48.170 --> 01:47:49.330
I love it.
