00:11.928 --> 00:13.888
<i>Why do people do
the things they do?</i>

00:15.557 --> 00:17.934
<i>I never thought it was that complicated.</i>

00:20.603 --> 00:22.313
<i>You do what seems right</i>

00:22.313 --> 00:23.314
<i>in the moment.</i>

00:25.650 --> 00:27.318
<i>When I first met Topper,</i>

00:27.944 --> 00:30.530
<i>I just thought he was the perfect guy.</i>

00:31.781 --> 00:32.782
<i>Polite,</i>

00:33.575 --> 00:34.576
<i>sweet,</i>

00:35.660 --> 00:37.370
<i>from a good family.</i>

00:38.788 --> 00:40.749
<i>He was everything John B wasn't.</i>

00:42.751 --> 00:47.547
<i>- But the heart wants what it wants.</i>

00:48.173 --> 00:51.259
<i>And now,
after everything that's happened,</i>

00:52.844 --> 00:54.387
<i>it doesn't seem so simple.</i>

01:04.147 --> 01:07.108
- All right, I'm starving.
- Yeah, same.

01:07.108 --> 01:09.611
Time to smother your hunger.

01:09.611 --> 01:12.322
- Who says that?
- I'm never gonna say that again.

01:12.322 --> 01:14.157
I'm sorry.

01:15.575 --> 01:18.495
I had a really good time yesterday.

01:20.455 --> 01:24.209
It was nice to have a day, a single day,

01:25.293 --> 01:27.504
without it being about...

01:28.046 --> 01:31.883
- About trying to run from the cops and...
- Yeah.

01:31.883 --> 01:33.468
Jacking your dad's truck.

01:33.468 --> 01:36.888
Oh yeah. Thanks for that.
He was super happy. It was perfect.

01:40.266 --> 01:41.768
You know what? Thank you.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.815
I was in a really rough spot.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.195
I had a really great time with you.

01:52.779 --> 01:56.825
And, uh, yeah, Sarah,
I've been thinking about you a lot.

01:56.825 --> 01:59.244
I'm sure you already know that.

01:59.994 --> 02:02.038
I just can't imagine everything

02:02.038 --> 02:04.040
you got going on with your dad,

02:04.040 --> 02:07.252
your family,
and then the other people in your life.

02:07.836 --> 02:08.711
Hey, Sally.

02:08.711 --> 02:11.589
So I understand
if you just wanna take a second

02:12.090 --> 02:13.258
to breathe.

02:13.925 --> 02:14.843
Shit.

02:16.094 --> 02:17.220
You okay?

02:18.012 --> 02:19.722
- What?
- It's... it's Kiara.

02:19.722 --> 02:21.516
Ki... Oh.

02:21.516 --> 02:23.726
Is that okay?

02:27.689 --> 02:29.816
- And she saw us.
- Yeah.

02:32.235 --> 02:35.196
Here you go. Have a good day.

02:39.576 --> 02:40.535
Kie!

02:42.370 --> 02:43.705
Kie, wait, can we...

02:43.705 --> 02:47.250
- Topper and I were getting breakfast.
-  It's none of my business.

02:47.250 --> 02:49.669
That's it. You should join if you want to.

02:50.879 --> 02:51.796
Breakfast?

02:52.422 --> 02:54.048
Yeah, breakfast.

02:54.632 --> 02:56.217
Yo, Kie!

02:56.801 --> 02:58.052
Yo, Top.

02:59.929 --> 03:01.681
I had nowhere to go last night.

03:01.681 --> 03:05.894
Cleo's at Pope's. I couldn't find JJ.
John B and I got into, like, a thing.

03:05.894 --> 03:08.813
I'm-- He found me and took me to Mase
with a group of people.

03:08.813 --> 03:12.317
Okay, so you bring him to the Middle
of the Island Restaurant on a Saturday?

03:12.317 --> 03:14.319
Kie! What's up? Random, right?

03:15.403 --> 03:16.487
Look, I'm just gonna go.

03:16.487 --> 03:18.656
- So I don't want to impose.
- Oh, perfect.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.367
Gotta help my parents
set up for their party.

03:21.367 --> 03:23.369
You know what? I'm gonna go too.

03:23.369 --> 03:26.206
Wait. Wait, what?
Our food literally just came out.

03:26.206 --> 03:29.417
- I know.
- How are you gonna smother your hunger?

03:30.752 --> 03:32.462
- Topper. Um...
- Yeah, I'm leaving.

03:32.462 --> 03:33.838
I'm going with Kie.

03:33.838 --> 03:34.923
But thank you.

03:37.300 --> 03:38.468
I'm gonna call you.

03:43.681 --> 03:44.807
All right.

03:45.934 --> 03:46.935
See you, Sarah.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.439
Sarah, what are you doing?

03:54.359 --> 03:55.360
I don't know.

03:56.361 --> 03:59.322
-  Walk me through it one more time.
- Okay, right there.

03:59.322 --> 04:02.075
That's where they're taking him.
That's the site of the idol.

04:02.575 --> 04:05.745
You pointed to just South America,
you understand that, right?

04:06.412 --> 04:07.288
Yep.

04:08.790 --> 04:11.084
That's all you know?
He's somewhere in South America?

04:11.084 --> 04:13.711
That's why we're going
to the professor's house.

04:13.711 --> 04:15.421
- Look, he was at the site.
- Okay.

04:15.421 --> 04:17.590
So happy we have the map, then.

04:17.590 --> 04:20.593
Wait. Whoa, whoa! We're going
to a house now with a dead body in it?

04:20.593 --> 04:23.179
- That... that's where we're going?
- Yeah.

04:23.179 --> 04:25.932
And if the cops show up,
you know what that makes us look like?

04:27.141 --> 04:27.976
Yes.

04:28.935 --> 04:30.937
Okay, just making sure.

04:31.813 --> 04:34.315
Can we make it quick though?
Just in and out.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.293
His body's gone.

04:54.085 --> 04:55.503
Sowell was right here.

04:56.004 --> 04:58.464
- And Sowell was the...
- The professor.

04:58.965 --> 05:02.010
Right. No, I know what happened.
They've already been here, John B.

05:02.010 --> 05:05.263
They sent in the sweepers and now probably
decontaminated this entire room.

05:05.263 --> 05:08.057
- There's nothing left. We should get out.
- Maybe there's something.

05:08.057 --> 05:09.851
Okay, what are we looking for then?

05:09.851 --> 05:12.228
Anything to do with an archaeological dig.

05:12.228 --> 05:15.356
- Oh, thanks. That really narrows it down.
-  I'm trying.

05:15.857 --> 05:19.235
- Anything. All righty. Fricking anything.

05:19.819 --> 05:20.903
Seriously, man?

05:22.280 --> 05:24.866
Wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Don't leave your fingerprints, bro.

05:24.866 --> 05:26.826
This is a live crime scene, dude.

05:28.494 --> 05:31.247
Yeah, you know, actually,
I'm just gonna look in the kitchen.

05:31.247 --> 05:34.083
- No one ever checks the fridge.
- Yeah, go for that, man.

05:39.630 --> 05:40.757
We were right here.

05:45.261 --> 05:47.388
Dad, Sowell, the idol.

05:47.889 --> 05:49.307
<i>Tommy. Hey.</i>

05:52.060 --> 05:54.687
The temalacatl,
it asks a question.

05:55.563 --> 05:56.814
<i>The idol.</i>

05:56.814 --> 05:58.399
- The gnomon--

06:00.151 --> 06:02.362
Gnomon what, Tommy?
Gnomon what?

06:02.362 --> 06:03.863
<i>Kalinago.</i>

06:04.697 --> 06:05.698
<i>Temalacatl.</i>

06:18.252 --> 06:19.295
JJ.

06:20.838 --> 06:21.672
- JJ!
- Hmm?

06:22.799 --> 06:25.009
What is it? Snack time? What are we doing?

06:25.009 --> 06:27.470
You know what?
I feel very judged right now.

06:27.470 --> 06:28.596
- Sure.
- All right?

06:28.596 --> 06:31.182
There's an entire bird in here
that'll just go to waste, okay?

06:31.182 --> 06:33.893
I'm not gonna let that happen.
It's not like I'm stealing it.

06:33.893 --> 06:36.479
No one else is gonna eat it.
I was like, "I'll take the nutrients

06:36.479 --> 06:39.649
that this beautiful bird gives me
and fill the tank," all right?

06:39.649 --> 06:41.734
- I haven't been able to eat anything--
- JJ. Hey.

06:42.443 --> 06:43.694
- Find something?
- Yeah.

06:45.822 --> 06:47.949
"Local expedition team
departs for South America."

06:48.616 --> 06:49.909
One of these guys is Sowell?

06:50.535 --> 06:51.411
Right there.

06:51.911 --> 06:52.954
All right.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.498
-  Holy shit.
-  What?

06:55.498 --> 06:56.457
Neville.

06:57.291 --> 06:58.209
- What?
- Neville.

06:58.209 --> 07:00.753
The last things Sowell said
before he died was "Neville."

07:00.753 --> 07:02.713
- Neville, meaning...
-  Right there.

07:02.713 --> 07:04.549
Neville Persaud,

07:04.549 --> 07:06.134
expedition guide.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.430
So Sowell said,
"Five people on the expedition," right?

07:10.430 --> 07:11.889
- Right.
- Three of those people died.

07:11.889 --> 07:13.141
Which leaves us with two.

07:13.724 --> 07:15.184
- Sowell.
- Mm-hmm.

07:15.184 --> 07:16.352
Neville.

07:16.352 --> 07:18.271
- Yeah.
- He's the last one alive.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.898
Yeah, I think
Sowell was telling me to warn him.

07:21.607 --> 07:22.733
We need to find Neville.

07:46.257 --> 07:47.133
Hey, bud.

07:51.095 --> 07:52.013
Dad.

07:52.013 --> 07:53.473
Mm-hmm.

07:54.682 --> 07:57.143
- What the hell are you doing here?

07:57.143 --> 08:01.230
I could see you were in over your head,
so I came back to help you.

08:01.898 --> 08:04.275
-  You wanna help?
-  Yeah.

08:04.275 --> 08:05.359
Leave.

08:05.359 --> 08:09.030
- You can't be here.
- I know you stole the cross, Rafe.

08:12.074 --> 08:14.035
Now, come on. Rafe.

08:16.871 --> 08:18.789
You were tired of living in my shadow.

08:19.832 --> 08:23.085
And you felt like I overstepped.

08:23.085 --> 08:25.963
By giving away something of mine.
Why would I think that?

08:25.963 --> 08:29.634
You were right. I should've talked to you
before I donated it. You deserve that.

08:29.634 --> 08:31.052
Yeah. You should have.

08:31.844 --> 08:32.845
You're right.

08:32.845 --> 08:35.723
That was my mistake, but here we are,
and you have it,

08:35.723 --> 08:37.934
and we gotta be smart with it, okay?

08:37.934 --> 08:40.811
- Yeah.
- This cross is special<i>.</i>

08:40.811 --> 08:42.522
- Okay?
- Listen, the deal is done.

08:44.690 --> 08:45.525
What deal?

08:45.525 --> 08:47.527
- It's done.
- You had no time to get a deal done.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.821
Well, it is done
because I'm selling some of it today.

08:51.948 --> 08:54.951
- What do you mean, some of it?
- I melted that shit down.

08:58.829 --> 09:01.958
- You're joking. You didn't melt it down.
- No, no, I'm not joking.

09:01.958 --> 09:04.835
- Shit. I mean, I can... I'll show you now.
-  Rafe, no.

09:05.628 --> 09:08.589
- I mean, listen, this is just a...
- No, no.

09:09.632 --> 09:12.009
...just a very tiny fraction of it, so...

09:14.554 --> 09:16.138
You melted it?

09:16.138 --> 09:19.225
Yeah, I melted the Cross of Santo Domingo.
Yep, melted it.

09:19.225 --> 09:22.186
- How could you do that, Rafe?
-  I'm trying to make money off this.

09:22.186 --> 09:23.229
What? Why?

09:23.229 --> 09:26.357
Because you can't trace spare parts, Dad.
What are you talking about?

09:26.357 --> 09:29.819
Spare parts? It's...
It's priceless! It's one of a kind!

09:29.819 --> 09:31.362
-  What is the issue?
- Oh my God.

09:31.362 --> 09:34.407
I don't understand.
Tell me. Can you enlighten me?

09:34.407 --> 09:38.244
Look, even if you don't care about it
at all, it's lost all its value.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.245
- It's a relic.
- Whatever.

09:39.245 --> 09:42.331
- You can't melt down the cross!
- Yes, I can. Just stop, stop!

09:43.541 --> 09:45.084
I'm talking now!

09:46.252 --> 09:48.421
All right? This isn't about you!

09:53.134 --> 09:55.928
I mean, I was...
I was held hostage at Singh's,

09:56.512 --> 09:58.764
locked up, not knowing
if I was gonna live or die,

09:58.764 --> 10:01.475
and I thought, "If I get out,
I'm not going to sit around

10:01.475 --> 10:03.519
and wait for a handout from you."

10:04.854 --> 10:07.773
- I was gonna take what's mine, okay?

10:08.274 --> 10:09.317
Rightfully mine.

10:11.068 --> 10:12.153
Do you understand?

10:12.737 --> 10:13.988
- Yes.
- You get it?

10:13.988 --> 10:15.072
- Yeah.
- Good.

10:19.702 --> 10:21.037
Okay. Okay, Rafe.

10:21.537 --> 10:23.873
- What's done is done.
- Yeah, it is done.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.875
Now we gotta move forward, okay?

10:25.875 --> 10:28.210
You gotta do the things
I sent you here to do, all right?

10:28.210 --> 10:30.921
So we can go back to Guadeloupe,
and we'll start again.

10:30.921 --> 10:32.715
- Listen.
- We'll get a brand-new life.

10:32.715 --> 10:34.634
- I wanna start again too.
- Okay, good.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.969
- Okay, but not in Guadeloupe.
- What?

10:36.969 --> 10:39.305
Why the hell would I start over there?

10:40.723 --> 10:43.893
Because we can't stay here, son.

10:43.893 --> 10:44.935
No.

10:45.603 --> 10:48.731
No, <i>you</i> can't stay here. I can.

10:50.858 --> 10:53.694
I mean, I got a crew here.
I... I got... I got my home.

10:54.570 --> 10:59.283
Okay, Dad, what I'm saying is,
I don't need you anymore.

11:02.620 --> 11:03.537
I'm good.

11:05.998 --> 11:07.875
Rafe, Rafe, Rafe, Rafe, listen to me.

11:11.170 --> 11:13.714
What are you gonna do? You gonna hit me?

11:13.714 --> 11:15.466
- Rafe.
- With your cane?

11:17.385 --> 11:19.804
I'm gonna sell my gold.

11:19.804 --> 11:21.097
Okay? My gold.

11:22.056 --> 11:23.474
I'm gonna do whatever else I want,

11:23.474 --> 11:26.268
and there's actually nothing
you can do about it, okay?

11:33.192 --> 11:34.318
Go home, Dad.

11:41.701 --> 11:44.537
All right, Sarah.
It's time to come clean.

11:44.537 --> 11:45.955
What happened?

11:45.955 --> 11:47.123
You and Topper?

11:47.123 --> 11:48.082
Oh God!

11:49.667 --> 11:51.502
It's actually so embarrassing.

11:53.337 --> 11:57.091
He caught me
slugging beer at the Tiki Bar.

11:57.091 --> 11:58.801
- You weren't.
- Yeah.

11:58.801 --> 12:00.219
Shot drinking.

12:00.928 --> 12:03.639
- I'm not judging.
- I wouldn't blame you if you were.

12:05.766 --> 12:10.187
And then a couple kids from KCD rolled up,
and they were already going to Mase.

12:10.813 --> 12:12.064
And then...

12:13.899 --> 12:14.734
I kissed him.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.610
<i>♪ Look in the mirror ♪</i>

12:17.653 --> 12:18.904
<i>♪ Who do you see? ♪</i>

12:19.488 --> 12:20.573
Do you hate me?

12:23.534 --> 12:24.869
Hate's the wrong word.

12:27.037 --> 12:28.122
<i>♪ Someone familiar... ♪</i>

12:28.122 --> 12:30.040
So you and John B are just done?

12:30.040 --> 12:33.669
No. Well, I don't know.
I don't want to be.

12:33.669 --> 12:37.465
Like since the island,
everything has felt so... abnormal,

12:37.465 --> 12:40.176
and it just felt nice
to feel something normal again.

12:40.176 --> 12:41.510
And I, like...

12:44.138 --> 12:45.097
I'm a mess.

12:46.515 --> 12:47.933
I feel like such a mess.

12:50.853 --> 12:53.063
I think we're all a little messed up.

12:54.273 --> 12:55.232
Yeah.

12:56.150 --> 12:57.151
You,

12:57.151 --> 12:58.194
me,

12:58.694 --> 12:59.653
JJ.

13:01.530 --> 13:05.117
He stole that money clip from my dad,
and I'm still pissed about it.

13:05.701 --> 13:08.746
Just pretending he doesn't care.
He won't talk to me.

13:11.373 --> 13:13.334
- I'd rather argue about it.
- Right.

13:17.630 --> 13:18.839
Wheezie?

13:18.839 --> 13:19.882
What?

13:19.882 --> 13:21.592
I texted her when we got in.

13:21.592 --> 13:24.970
<i>Sarah,
don't be mad, but I ran away.</i>

13:24.970 --> 13:27.389
<i>I'm in the OBX, and I have to see you.</i>

13:28.015 --> 13:30.518
<i>Come to our rental condo
on Greensboro Street, okay?</i>

13:31.018 --> 13:33.145
<i>But, Sarah, please don't tell anyone.</i>

13:46.742 --> 13:50.538
Okay, now, so let me get this straight.
So, because you know a guy

13:50.538 --> 13:53.457
with the same last name as Neville,
you think they've gotta be related.

13:53.457 --> 13:55.668
- That's your master plan?
- Right. Okay.

13:55.668 --> 13:58.462
How many people do you know
with the last name Persaud?

13:58.462 --> 14:00.589
I met a guy here
last summer with my cousin

14:00.589 --> 14:03.634
'cause we're doing
the growing business. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:03.634 --> 14:05.344
Last name Persaud.

14:05.344 --> 14:07.137
Or wait, was it Percett?

14:07.137 --> 14:09.181
- No, no, no. Okay, you think--
- No, no, no.

14:09.181 --> 14:13.269
- 'Cause we're talking about my dad's life.
- No, I know. I know Mr. Persaud.

14:13.269 --> 14:14.770
Trust me. It's cool.

14:14.770 --> 14:16.689
Hey, uh, Mr. P, right?

14:16.689 --> 14:18.232
- Hey!
-  Yeah. I told you.

14:18.232 --> 14:20.150
Yeah, yeah, yeah. What's going on, man?

14:20.150 --> 14:23.737
Yeah. Hey, so we're looking for...
we're looking for Neville.

14:23.737 --> 14:26.740
- Is he still here?
- Nah, nah, nah, he's out there.

14:26.740 --> 14:29.785
- Been holding up near Doe Creek.
- Doe Creek?

14:29.785 --> 14:31.996
In his houseboat. Way, way back.

14:33.706 --> 14:34.748
Why you ever doubt me?

14:34.748 --> 14:37.418
The idea was a little far-fetched
is all I'm saying.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.795
All right, so we're looking for

14:40.379 --> 14:41.630
a houseboat.

14:44.091 --> 14:47.219
-  That looks like a houseboat.
- Well, you think he's there?

14:47.219 --> 14:49.513
- I don't know. I mean--
- Only one way to find out.

14:49.513 --> 14:50.764
Neville! Hey!

14:50.764 --> 14:52.308
- Stop it!
- Dude, what?

14:52.308 --> 14:55.269
What are you talking about, what?
He thinks people are trying to kill him.

14:55.269 --> 14:56.687
He's probably packing.

14:57.396 --> 14:59.064
Ah, okay. It's a death trap.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.400
Yeah, unfortunately,
we don't have a choice.

15:01.984 --> 15:04.278
He's the only guy alive
who knows where my dad is.

15:19.501 --> 15:21.128
JJ, keep it down.

15:31.972 --> 15:34.516
The stove's warm.
He's still here.

15:41.148 --> 15:43.692
- Maybe he split when he heard us coming.
- Devils!

15:46.111 --> 15:48.989
Sir! Listen! Neville! We just wanna talk.

15:48.989 --> 15:50.991
John B! Trip line! Trip line!

15:54.203 --> 15:57.206
- No, no, no, no!
- Let him go!

15:57.206 --> 16:00.250
- Stop, stop! We know Professor Sowell.
- Who gave you that name?

16:00.250 --> 16:01.293
Let it go, dude!

16:01.293 --> 16:03.212
- Listen to me, we're friends, okay?
- Hey!

16:03.212 --> 16:07.341
You were in Orinoco last year!
With five other people. Right?

16:08.008 --> 16:10.427
- How did you know that?
- Let go, let go.

16:10.427 --> 16:11.762
Let it go!

16:11.762 --> 16:13.681
- Let it go!

16:16.100 --> 16:18.477
We're on the same team, home dog, okay?

16:18.477 --> 16:20.688
Look, we don't wanna hurt you, okay?

16:22.773 --> 16:23.857
Put it down.

16:25.484 --> 16:26.402
Jesus.

16:26.402 --> 16:28.570
Look, we were just with Sowell yesterday.

16:29.613 --> 16:30.572
He, uh...

16:32.241 --> 16:33.367
He didn't make it.

16:34.994 --> 16:35.911
He's dead?

16:37.121 --> 16:38.122
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:39.623 --> 16:40.457
I'm sorry.

16:43.168 --> 16:44.169
You good?

16:47.089 --> 16:48.424
I'm the last one left.

16:50.759 --> 16:51.927
Yeah.

16:54.096 --> 16:56.473
That's why we had to get to you
before they did.

16:58.851 --> 16:59.935
If we found you,

17:00.769 --> 17:01.687
they can too.

17:03.188 --> 17:04.857
I just have a few questions.

17:06.942 --> 17:09.236
Solana, you've been there. Yeah?

17:10.487 --> 17:11.989
That is a place of evil.

17:13.407 --> 17:14.241
Okay.

17:14.241 --> 17:16.035
That stone piece right there.

17:17.494 --> 17:20.205
Me and my dad found the thingy
that goes in the center.

17:20.205 --> 17:21.915
- The gnomon.
-  Gnomon.

17:21.915 --> 17:25.002
- What's a gnomon?
- The gnomon. Hey, I got it. I got it.

17:25.002 --> 17:25.961
Listen to me.

17:25.961 --> 17:29.548
Now, there's some bad men
who have taken my father to this place,

17:29.548 --> 17:30.966
and they're gonna kill him.

17:31.967 --> 17:34.219
So I need your help
to find this place, Neville.

17:34.219 --> 17:35.429
No, no, no, no.

17:36.597 --> 17:37.514
No?

17:39.725 --> 17:41.727
The curse has already done enough.

17:42.227 --> 17:44.313
No, no, no. Look, it's not a curse. Okay?

17:44.313 --> 17:46.648
I understand that it's dangerous,
but I need your help.

17:46.648 --> 17:48.067
- Hey.
- What? What is going on?

17:48.067 --> 17:49.651
Shut up! Shut up, shut up!

17:52.279 --> 17:55.407
Hey, Neville, how much traffic
do you get on this river?

17:55.407 --> 17:56.700
Nothing.

17:56.700 --> 17:59.244
Neville! Neville Persaud!

18:08.212 --> 18:09.922
-  Jesus!

18:12.299 --> 18:15.302
- Oh my God!

18:15.302 --> 18:16.553
Get the anchor!

18:18.138 --> 18:19.223
Go!

18:19.223 --> 18:20.307
Go.

18:36.740 --> 18:37.741
Neville?

18:41.411 --> 18:42.329
Neville?

18:47.626 --> 18:48.627
Neville?

18:49.128 --> 18:50.546
I know you're in here.

18:51.255 --> 18:52.756
Let's get this over with.

18:53.841 --> 18:55.425
Come on now.

18:55.425 --> 18:57.010
You can't hide forever.

19:07.479 --> 19:08.480
Shit.

19:27.124 --> 19:29.042
- Hey, hey. Wait, wait.

19:29.626 --> 19:32.129
Not this time, my friend. Uh-uh.

19:35.632 --> 19:36.466
Down.

19:49.146 --> 19:50.355
JJ, machete!

19:50.939 --> 19:52.482
Cut the line! Cut the line!

19:58.280 --> 19:59.615
This isn't over!

20:00.115 --> 20:01.074
Raj!

20:01.575 --> 20:03.118
-  Go, go!
-  Go, go!

20:03.118 --> 20:05.245
- You gotta go. You gotta go.
- Yeah, I'm going!

20:08.540 --> 20:11.043
Are they coming?

20:11.043 --> 20:12.085
No, we're good.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.463
You owe me an anchor.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.215
You're welcome.

20:21.678 --> 20:23.680
- And you know this guy is good too?
- Mm-hmm.

20:23.680 --> 20:26.266
I mean,
we got a lot of people to see today.

20:26.266 --> 20:28.268
<i>So here's what we're gonna do.</i>

20:29.186 --> 20:31.063
<i>We're gonna piecemeal this shit out.</i>

20:33.982 --> 20:35.317
<i>One nugget</i>

20:35.317 --> 20:36.318
<i>at a time.</i>

20:42.157 --> 20:43.450
<i>Sell a bit here.</i>

20:45.702 --> 20:47.412
<i>A little bit there.</i>

20:49.456 --> 20:50.499
<i>Under the radar.</i>

20:57.673 --> 20:58.632
Authentic.

21:02.177 --> 21:03.303
A little light.

21:07.224 --> 21:09.726
And if you would kindly follow me,
Miss Sofia.

21:09.726 --> 21:11.478
- VIP section.
- Oh yeah?

21:11.478 --> 21:14.356
Yeah, only very, very special people
are allowed here.

21:14.356 --> 21:15.565
Mm.

21:15.565 --> 21:17.651
So you can see the water.

21:18.485 --> 21:21.321
Hey, that ain't no Jim Beam bullshit.
All right?

21:21.905 --> 21:25.284
That's Pappy Van Winkle.
That's like a day's salary, bro.

21:25.284 --> 21:28.161
If you don't have a drink in your hand,
get the hell out of my house.

21:28.161 --> 21:31.498
- Get off my property.

21:31.498 --> 21:33.458
So this is the VIP life, huh?

21:33.458 --> 21:34.501
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.130
Cool.

21:39.256 --> 21:41.466
- You wanna see some more?
-  Yeah, I'm down.

21:41.466 --> 21:45.470
Great news. That's great news.
I'll give you the grand tour.

21:45.470 --> 21:46.930
Don't go running.

21:47.514 --> 21:49.850
Hey, give me like five minutes.
I'll meet you upstairs.

21:49.850 --> 21:50.851
Okay.

21:50.851 --> 21:53.312
Country Club! Come on, boy!

21:54.396 --> 21:56.606
Come on, cheers me on that right there.

21:56.606 --> 21:58.859
Whoo! Whoo!

21:59.651 --> 22:03.280
It ain't a bad plan, man.
That shit really did work, didn't it?

22:03.280 --> 22:04.573
What'd I say?

22:04.573 --> 22:08.327
Only one real way I see
this shit falling through for.

22:09.745 --> 22:10.620
How's that?

22:11.913 --> 22:13.206
With your pops, Rafe.

22:15.792 --> 22:18.045
- Yeah, see, uh...
- What do you mean, my pops?

22:18.045 --> 22:19.629
Think about this shit, bro.

22:20.756 --> 22:23.633
Your dad has confessed

22:24.509 --> 22:28.472
to killing
a whole raft full of folks, ain't he?

22:29.181 --> 22:31.725
But the only body that we have, Rafe,

22:31.725 --> 22:32.976
is Sheriff Pete.

22:36.355 --> 22:39.316
And your daddy didn't kill
Sheriff Pete, Rafe. You did.

22:39.316 --> 22:42.861
Hey. We're not talking
about this right now, okay?

22:42.861 --> 22:43.779
We're good, bro.

22:43.779 --> 22:46.156
You had to save your dad.
I respect that shit.

22:46.156 --> 22:48.241
And then he took the fall for you.

22:49.534 --> 22:51.370
But think about it from his perspective.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.706
Because the only thing standing
between the life he used to live

22:54.706 --> 22:57.042
and the life he's living now is you, Rafe.

22:58.460 --> 23:03.215
I don't give a damn how religious,
self-righteous you think your daddy is.

23:03.215 --> 23:04.758
Sooner or later,

23:04.758 --> 23:06.718
he's going to realize it's you

23:06.718 --> 23:07.803
or him.

23:09.346 --> 23:11.681
What do you think he's going to do?

23:12.516 --> 23:14.851
So if I were you,

23:15.727 --> 23:19.106
I'd move to get him off the battlefield
before he starts squawking.

23:22.025 --> 23:23.151
But that's just me.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.571
You do you, Country Club.

23:30.242 --> 23:33.495
You know something, Mr. Heyward?
I have this jerk shrimp recipe

23:33.495 --> 23:35.705
that'll have people
lining up out the door.

23:35.705 --> 23:36.748
- I like that.
- I like it.

23:36.748 --> 23:39.918
-  I like that.
- Hey, where you headed to, killer man?

23:40.419 --> 23:42.504
School. On a Saturday.

23:43.046 --> 23:44.297
Sucks, but I got no choice.

23:44.297 --> 23:47.968
Who needs school when you have
that gold making up for your scholarship?

23:47.968 --> 23:50.095
Yeah, I don't have it yet, but...

23:50.095 --> 23:53.265
Hey, thanks for last night.

23:54.182 --> 23:55.684
You know I got your back.

23:56.852 --> 23:59.271
Keep your head up, Pope. You're a Heyward.

23:59.980 --> 24:01.064
You hear me?

24:01.648 --> 24:04.067
Now, I want straight A's this semester.

24:05.861 --> 24:08.196
I think we raising him right.
What you think?

24:08.196 --> 24:11.700
- I think we raising them right too, Cleo.

24:13.160 --> 24:16.496
Okey dokey,
so if you just follow along with me.

24:17.581 --> 24:21.126
So we have a normal triangle here,

24:21.710 --> 24:23.170
and every triangle

24:23.879 --> 24:25.422
has three medians.

24:25.422 --> 24:26.548
What's a median?

24:26.548 --> 24:29.634
A median is basically a line
that goes from one vertex

24:29.634 --> 24:33.054
to the midpoint opposite that vertex.

24:33.054 --> 24:36.183
And since the triangle has three vertices,

24:36.725 --> 24:39.936
we're gonna do the same to this vertex,

24:39.936 --> 24:44.524
median line, running to the midpoint
opposite that vertex.

24:44.524 --> 24:47.486
And last but not least,
we got the last vertex here,

24:47.486 --> 24:49.738
the midpoint opposite that vertex.

24:51.490 --> 24:56.536
And what's cool about this,
the medians all intersect at the...

24:57.704 --> 24:58.622
Centroid.

24:58.622 --> 24:59.915
Pretty cool, huh?

25:01.374 --> 25:02.876
And if you wanna even go further...

25:04.711 --> 25:06.296
Each median is divided...

25:13.428 --> 25:16.723
Always Denmark Tanny.
Elaborate, Mr. Heyward.

25:17.307 --> 25:20.644
Did Denmark Tanny ever write
about the exact origins of his wealth?

25:20.644 --> 25:23.271
Denmark bought his freedom
with a bar of gold, right?

25:23.271 --> 25:25.607
And now that we know
he was on the Royal Merchant,

25:25.607 --> 25:27.651
it's safe to assume that his fortune

25:27.651 --> 25:29.945
and the Royal Merchant gold
are linked, right?

25:29.945 --> 25:32.572
That would be a fair assumption. Yes.

25:32.572 --> 25:36.743
Have you ever wondered exactly
where all that gold came from?

25:36.743 --> 25:39.079
Like, what mine produced all of that?

25:40.205 --> 25:41.831
You know, I never thought of it.

25:42.958 --> 25:46.002
I mean, that gold changed his life,

25:46.503 --> 25:48.296
and Denmark Tanny
was on a ship with the priest

25:48.296 --> 25:51.508
who was the last living person
to see the origins of that gold.

25:52.008 --> 25:53.843
Starting to see that the diary

25:53.843 --> 25:56.846
might not have been stolen
for historical reasons?

25:57.847 --> 25:59.933
Have you ever come
across anything of Denmark's

25:59.933 --> 26:02.477
that might have been
South American in origin?

26:02.477 --> 26:03.436
No.

26:04.396 --> 26:08.275
But given your heritage, Mr. Heyward,

26:09.192 --> 26:12.153
I assumed you've scoured
your own family archives.

26:14.948 --> 26:17.659
Yeah, I mean,
that's like the first thing I did.

26:18.243 --> 26:20.579
Thank you so much, Mr. Sunn.
Great to see you again.

26:20.579 --> 26:23.331
- Good to see you, Mr. Heyward.
- Thank you. Yeah.

26:43.810 --> 26:44.769
Hello?

26:47.939 --> 26:49.024
Wheezie?

26:50.734 --> 26:51.651
Wheeze?

26:59.326 --> 27:01.328
I fricking knew it. I knew it.

27:04.331 --> 27:06.207
I needed to see you, Sarah.

27:06.207 --> 27:08.585
I just needed to tell you I'm sorry
because I am so--

27:08.585 --> 27:10.503
No, you stay right there!

27:11.421 --> 27:13.423
Do you know how stupid this is?

27:14.549 --> 27:16.968
If anybody sees you, you go to jail!

27:16.968 --> 27:19.638
If I yell and the cops come,
you go to jail!

27:20.221 --> 27:23.433
- I don't think you're gonna do that.
- Try me.

27:24.684 --> 27:25.894
I already did.

27:27.437 --> 27:28.480
What?

27:32.400 --> 27:33.652
Don't worry.

27:34.235 --> 27:36.154
I called them to the unit next door.

27:37.989 --> 27:38.990
I could yell.

27:40.241 --> 27:41.117
I might.

27:42.452 --> 27:44.829
So whatever it is you're here for,
I suggest you hurry up

27:44.829 --> 27:46.581
and you don't piss me off.

27:48.124 --> 27:49.084
So angry.

27:50.126 --> 27:52.504
- So much hatred.
- Because I'm homeless!

27:52.504 --> 27:53.963
I have no money!

27:54.506 --> 27:56.216
I have no family anymore!

27:57.759 --> 28:00.512
I have nowhere to go because of you!

28:01.554 --> 28:02.806
I know.

28:02.806 --> 28:05.141
And you used my baby sister as bait

28:06.184 --> 28:07.560
to get me here.

28:08.269 --> 28:10.105
- I know.

28:10.105 --> 28:13.483
Sarah, I know everything I did,
everything that happened.

28:14.651 --> 28:15.610
All of it.

28:16.736 --> 28:18.363
It's my fault. I know.

28:19.322 --> 28:22.701
I don't know how I'll make up for it
or if I even can, but I'll try.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.911
- I'm gonna do what I can.
- Good luck.

28:24.911 --> 28:28.790
I know you won't believe me, but I'm
trying to live my life a different way.

28:29.999 --> 28:31.418
You want to make amends?

28:33.878 --> 28:35.964
You give the gold back to the Pogues.

28:39.551 --> 28:41.094
We can talk about that.

28:41.094 --> 28:42.762
- We can.

28:43.722 --> 28:47.058
- They certainly deserve some of it.
- Let's talk about it.

28:47.559 --> 28:49.185
Right now I'm here for you.

28:56.276 --> 28:58.153
This is for the condo. Um...

28:59.654 --> 29:03.366
This is some money for you.
Got all the money you'll need on it.

29:05.493 --> 29:06.411
I'll just...

29:23.219 --> 29:25.305
I know you're not gonna forgive me.

29:26.806 --> 29:27.766
How could you?

29:30.185 --> 29:32.604
I just want you to know that I love you.

29:33.313 --> 29:34.439
And that I'm sorry.

29:41.446 --> 29:42.447
Bless you, baby.

29:57.504 --> 30:00.256
Look, Neville,
they're taking my father there.

30:00.256 --> 30:02.175
You're the only person
who knows where it is.

30:02.175 --> 30:05.303
Neville, they are going to kill him
unless you help us.

30:08.056 --> 30:09.599
They're going after the gold.

30:09.599 --> 30:12.227
Yeah, what else
are they going to be going after?

30:13.061 --> 30:14.479
Then they'll die anyway.

30:15.104 --> 30:16.815
Unless they can pass the test,

30:16.815 --> 30:19.359
which they won't
if they can't translate the idol.

30:19.859 --> 30:21.110
You know the story.

30:22.654 --> 30:23.738
No.

30:24.239 --> 30:26.866
El Dorado was found by a Guajiro king,

30:27.408 --> 30:30.036
and when it came time
for him to slip his mortal coil

30:30.036 --> 30:32.413
and meet my greats on the astral plane,

30:32.413 --> 30:35.333
he wasn't just going to give
the gold to his sons.

30:36.042 --> 30:37.502
It was the source of his power.

30:38.086 --> 30:42.090
It had to go to the wisest man,
and to ensure this actually happened,

30:42.090 --> 30:44.676
he set up the test of the gnomon.

30:45.385 --> 30:48.304
- So there's, like, some test now. Okay.
- There's always a test.

30:48.304 --> 30:51.224
Whoever passes the test
gains access to the gold.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.768
You fail the test, you die.

30:54.769 --> 30:58.439
If you somehow get
to the gold without taking the test,

30:59.357 --> 31:00.233
then you die.

31:00.233 --> 31:04.571
Great. He's lying, right? 'Cause there's
no way that actually can happen, right?

31:04.571 --> 31:08.741
Tell that to the crew
of the San Jose and the Royal Merchant.

31:08.741 --> 31:10.535
We don't want the gold, Neville.

31:12.412 --> 31:13.371
Well...

31:14.414 --> 31:16.165
Just want to save my dad.

31:18.835 --> 31:19.752
Take the wheel.

31:19.752 --> 31:21.004
Yes, sir.

31:26.050 --> 31:28.511
You must go
to the port of Tres Rocas.

31:29.804 --> 31:32.348
From there, find ferry passage

31:32.932 --> 31:35.226
from a river guide called Jose.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.437
He will take you up the Orinoco

31:38.479 --> 31:39.856
to El Tesoro.

31:40.440 --> 31:43.860
It is there.
In the bush, you will find a site.

31:45.737 --> 31:47.530
Guess we back in the G-game?

31:48.197 --> 31:51.993
Make yourself pure of heart, pure of mind.

31:51.993 --> 31:54.203
You are there to save your father.

31:55.955 --> 31:57.498
The gold kills everyone.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.336
- All right.
-  Move over.

32:01.961 --> 32:02.962
Yes, sir.

32:07.091 --> 32:08.426
 How's it coming?

32:08.927 --> 32:10.637
You making it out, John?

32:12.513 --> 32:14.140
Yeah, yeah.

32:14.140 --> 32:16.225
Making some progress.

32:16.726 --> 32:18.978
Got some of the stern here sorted.

32:20.104 --> 32:24.525
Tells a story of the Sun King
and how he came to rule,

32:25.026 --> 32:27.445
the hagiography of the divine leader.

32:27.445 --> 32:29.948
He emerged, spread his light, yada yada.

32:31.324 --> 32:34.494
And what's this story exactly, John.
Tell me more now.

32:35.119 --> 32:37.205
Well, that's what I'm working out.

32:37.872 --> 32:42.168
So far, best I can tell, it starts
when the king springs fully grown

32:42.168 --> 32:44.045
from out of the earth.

32:44.045 --> 32:47.131
From the loins
of the earth, indeed.

32:48.007 --> 32:50.009
Yeah, that's... that's promising, right?

32:52.762 --> 32:54.514
To a fast translation, John.

32:56.099 --> 32:57.725
Hell, I'll drink to that.

33:02.772 --> 33:03.773
Hmm.

33:05.692 --> 33:09.112
You know, my family
came over here as indentured servants.

33:10.405 --> 33:12.156
All the way from India.

33:12.156 --> 33:16.369
That was in 1913. They came over
with the last formal expedition

33:16.369 --> 33:17.870
to search for El Dorado.

33:17.870 --> 33:19.163
Teddy Roosevelt's?

33:19.747 --> 33:22.000
Your family was on the last expedition?

33:25.253 --> 33:26.129
Teddy Roosevelt.

33:27.755 --> 33:29.090
We were tricked, you know.

33:29.799 --> 33:30.925
Humiliated.

33:32.301 --> 33:33.302
Enslaved.

33:34.220 --> 33:37.223
But on the next full moon,
on the solstice,

33:37.223 --> 33:39.726
when the moonlight shines upon Water Cat,

33:41.352 --> 33:45.273
you, John, will have solved
the meaning of the gnomon,

33:45.273 --> 33:48.192
and my family's history
will be avenged, you know.

33:50.069 --> 33:53.531
Or I'll tie you to a banyan tree
and leave you for the ants.

34:01.789 --> 34:03.124
Hi!

34:08.046 --> 34:10.298
<i>♪ I want you to want me... ♪</i>

34:10.298 --> 34:13.426
Are you kidding me, Sarah?
That doesn't even make sense.

34:13.426 --> 34:16.429
Ward's on this island?
Like, the same island we are on, Sarah?

34:16.429 --> 34:18.473
- Yes, he's back. Mm-hmm.

34:20.349 --> 34:22.810
The second I see him,
I'm turning him in, I swear.

34:23.770 --> 34:25.396
I don't know how you do it.

34:26.481 --> 34:29.776
Every time I wanna complain about my dad,
I just think about your dad.

34:29.776 --> 34:32.987
- Oh, glad to be of service.
- Works every time.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.782
- I'm glad I could help.
- It's great.

34:37.825 --> 34:38.826
Appreciate it.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.415
You didn't tell me
Topper was gonna be here.

34:44.415 --> 34:47.126
Sorry. My mom invited
like the whole island.

34:47.835 --> 34:48.795
Shit.

34:49.337 --> 34:50.463
It's not a big deal.

34:50.463 --> 34:52.340
-  Shit.
- I'll keep him away.

34:54.634 --> 34:58.387
Here's the game plan,
get the girls, go find Pope and Cleo,

34:58.387 --> 35:01.015
get down to South America
as soon as possible. Cool?

35:01.015 --> 35:04.936
Seems a bit vague, I gotta say, John B.
Also, I don't got a passport, dog.

35:04.936 --> 35:07.105
Hey, look, don't bore me
with the details, all right?

35:07.105 --> 35:09.398
We'll figure that out later.
Hey, look at me.

35:09.398 --> 35:11.234
- Yeah.
-  Gonna get Sarah.

35:11.234 --> 35:14.403
Gonna get Kie, little rendezvous mission.
Back on the boat, get out of here.

35:14.403 --> 35:17.782
The other day, Mike and I kind of got into
a little bit of a tiff, all right?

35:17.782 --> 35:21.077
And if I go over there right now
and Mike sees me,

35:21.077 --> 35:23.079
he's not gonna let Kiara
out of his sight, boom.

35:23.079 --> 35:25.414
Mission blown,
we can't go down to South America.

35:25.414 --> 35:27.041
Look. Just don't get seen.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.962
- You're right. I'll stay here.
-  No.

35:30.962 --> 35:33.256
- That's not what I was saying.
-  I got your six.

35:33.256 --> 35:35.299
-  Yep. Great.
- I'll keep her running, dog.

35:35.299 --> 35:37.426
- Chop-chop though, okay?
-  Yep, thanks.

35:40.638 --> 35:44.392
<i>♪ Oh, didn't I, didn't I
Didn't I see you crying... ♪</i>

35:44.392 --> 35:47.520
Oh, great.
Um, well, I'm gonna go over here.

35:47.520 --> 35:50.940
- Please don't. Okay.
- I won't go far. Just say the word.

35:51.816 --> 35:52.859
-  Mm.
- Hi.

35:52.859 --> 35:54.819
- Hey, how's it going?
-  Good. How are you?

35:54.819 --> 35:58.447
Good. Um, I'm-- Well, I don't wanna
blow your cover or anything,

35:58.447 --> 36:00.116
so I'll just keep it low-key.

36:00.116 --> 36:02.618
I know we're not public or anything.

36:02.618 --> 36:04.912
You know what I mean? Um...

36:05.538 --> 36:07.707
Hey, Kie! How are you?

36:07.707 --> 36:10.918
Oh, hey. I didn't even see you, bro.

36:12.003 --> 36:14.547
Uh, did you do these decorations here?

36:14.547 --> 36:17.258
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah. Party City.

36:17.800 --> 36:19.385
It's a great selection.

36:20.553 --> 36:21.971
Cool. Well, um...

36:21.971 --> 36:24.932
-  Cheers.
- Cheers.

36:24.932 --> 36:26.934
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah, see you around.

36:26.934 --> 36:29.729
- Just take it easy on those. Pace it.
- Yeah.

36:29.729 --> 36:30.813
Bye, Kie.

36:32.648 --> 36:34.275
At least he kept it short.

36:34.275 --> 36:36.777
- Hang on. Please, excuse me.

36:36.777 --> 36:38.738
Thank you. Um...

36:39.488 --> 36:44.660
I just want to say a few words,
and I'm not much into giving speeches,

36:44.660 --> 36:47.079
but I do want to say
thank you for coming out

36:47.079 --> 36:50.374
and thank you for your support
after a rough few months.

36:52.460 --> 36:55.796
I want to say thank you
to our daughter for being here.

36:56.589 --> 36:58.090
Hey, we love you.

36:58.758 --> 37:00.927
- Love you too.

37:00.927 --> 37:02.053
But most of all...

37:03.346 --> 37:05.014
- Come here.

37:06.432 --> 37:08.309
- Thank you, Anna...

37:09.060 --> 37:10.478
...for 15 years,

37:11.395 --> 37:14.315
for making this restaurant
a symbol of our life.

37:15.733 --> 37:18.194
- I love you.
- I love you.

37:18.194 --> 37:19.695
Love you, Mike and Anna!

37:20.738 --> 37:22.365
Figure Eight, the Cut.

37:23.241 --> 37:24.742
Everyone's together here.

37:24.742 --> 37:26.535
-  That's right!
- As one island.

37:27.328 --> 37:30.373
- So, thank you for putting up with us.

37:30.373 --> 37:32.750
- Cheers.
- Thank you all for coming.

37:32.750 --> 37:34.210
Cheers.

37:37.630 --> 37:39.590
- That was cute.
- Was it cute? We did good.

37:39.590 --> 37:40.925
You know we love you.

37:43.386 --> 37:44.887
Next year, next year.

37:47.223 --> 37:49.016
Psst. Sarah.

37:55.022 --> 37:57.275
-  Hi.
-  Hi.

37:58.734 --> 37:59.819
Long time no see.

38:00.820 --> 38:03.406
- Hi.
- Hey, come here. Come here, follow me.

38:03.948 --> 38:06.117
- Come on.
- What are you doing here?

38:07.201 --> 38:09.203
I have so much I have to tell you.

38:10.037 --> 38:12.373
I have so much I have to tell you.

38:12.373 --> 38:14.333
Sarah, I... I'm... I'm sorry.

38:16.002 --> 38:19.547
For the way I talked to you
at the Chateau, for lying about El Dorado,

38:19.547 --> 38:22.133
for not being there for you
when you needed me.

38:26.137 --> 38:30.099
It's fine. I'm sure your dad
probably didn't want you to say anything.

38:30.099 --> 38:31.183
No, no. Hey.

38:32.226 --> 38:33.269
I messed up.

38:37.690 --> 38:38.774
I missed you, Val.

38:45.614 --> 38:46.949
Missed you too, Vlad.

38:48.409 --> 38:51.329
Hey, look. We gotta get out of here.
We gotta go. Come on.

38:51.912 --> 38:54.290
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

38:54.790 --> 38:56.375
Sarah, what's... what's going on?

38:57.335 --> 39:01.505
Okay, before we go anywhere,
before we do anything,

39:02.381 --> 39:04.300
I have something I need to tell you.

39:06.052 --> 39:07.428
Okay. Talk to me.

39:09.263 --> 39:10.264
I made a mistake.

39:11.682 --> 39:13.476
And... and it's not something I planned,

39:13.476 --> 39:15.728
and it's definitely not something
I would ever do again.

39:16.729 --> 39:17.730
And...

39:18.814 --> 39:20.399
What's... what's going on, Sarah?

39:20.399 --> 39:22.401
I kind of hooked up with Topper.

39:27.948 --> 39:28.991
Oh.

39:33.788 --> 39:35.122
It was a mistake.

39:39.752 --> 39:43.047
And I wanna be with you,
and I don't wanna hide anything.

39:49.970 --> 39:51.430
- Please don't.
- Sarah.

39:58.145 --> 40:01.816
- Please say something.
- Sarah, Singh kidnapped my father, okay?

40:01.816 --> 40:04.568
And he's taking him
to South America to kill him.

40:06.070 --> 40:08.280
- How could you do this?
- I...

40:10.574 --> 40:12.243
Sorry.

40:12.243 --> 40:13.411
What?

40:15.788 --> 40:16.872
I trusted you.

40:20.626 --> 40:22.044
Till death do us part?

40:22.628 --> 40:23.629
Please.

40:25.631 --> 40:27.508
- John B.
- We're done.

40:28.384 --> 40:29.385
Okay?

40:46.110 --> 40:46.944
JJ.

40:47.945 --> 40:50.990
I saw John B.
I figured you couldn't be far.

40:52.241 --> 40:55.161
Just, uh, thought
I should keep my distance.

40:55.161 --> 40:58.122
Didn't really wanna spoil the party,
if you know what I'm saying.

40:58.122 --> 41:01.459
We were wondering
where you guys ran off to. You okay?

41:02.251 --> 41:03.085
No.

41:04.086 --> 41:05.546
Look, long story short,

41:05.546 --> 41:09.216
we're mounting a full search
and rescue mission right now

41:09.216 --> 41:10.968
because Big John got nabbed.

41:10.968 --> 41:13.387
- What do you mean, "got nabbed"?
- Like, actually nabbed.

41:13.387 --> 41:16.348
Uh, snatched, kidnapped, abducted,
that kind of thing.

41:16.348 --> 41:18.309
To South America by Singh.

41:18.809 --> 41:21.437
So we have to get down there
as soon as we can.

41:21.437 --> 41:23.522
- South America? Right now?
- Yeah, I know.

41:23.522 --> 41:26.192
It's a long shot,
but we're making a plan right now.

41:26.942 --> 41:29.862
I mean, you come in here
after stealing from my dad like,

41:29.862 --> 41:32.239
"We're all good.
Let's go to South America."

41:32.239 --> 41:35.618
So is that a no?
Uh, you're just gonna ghost us?

41:35.618 --> 41:39.079
JJ, I've been wanting to talk
since we got off the island.

41:39.788 --> 41:40.956
We need to talk.

41:41.665 --> 41:46.754
It's all I can think about.
I just can't do any of that right now.

41:48.672 --> 41:52.009
Okay, so you're saying
you don't wanna be a part of the plan

41:52.009 --> 41:54.678
when Big John is up for
execution right now.

41:54.678 --> 41:56.430
- Okay, cool. That's a no.
- I can't!

41:56.430 --> 41:58.557
Cool. All right.
That's all I needed to know.

41:59.934 --> 42:02.603
It's just that-- Actually, one last thing.

42:02.603 --> 42:04.772
When you see Mike,
could you just let him know

42:04.772 --> 42:07.191
that I don't feel bad
about the money clip?

42:07.191 --> 42:09.360
Okay? Just let him know
I actually needed it.

42:09.360 --> 42:12.821
So thank him for me, actually.
Appreciate that. Thank you.

42:14.782 --> 42:16.325
What is wrong with you?

42:17.618 --> 42:20.120
You're really acting like you don't care?

42:20.829 --> 42:24.416
I mean, seriously.
You're acting like I don't care.

42:24.416 --> 42:25.876
Like, I love you, dude.

42:28.420 --> 42:29.421
What?

42:31.590 --> 42:35.636
Kie, I mean, thanks.
Okay, great, no, look.

42:40.516 --> 42:42.726
It's not gonna work, okay?

42:45.312 --> 42:47.648
I'm gonna go help
my best friend save his father.

42:48.148 --> 42:50.609
Maybe I'll see you at the break
when I get back.

42:50.609 --> 42:51.694
Yeah, maybe.

42:52.486 --> 42:53.445
If I get back.

43:21.223 --> 43:23.726
Um, hey, I'll see you later. Okay?

43:25.769 --> 43:27.855
Hey, hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?

43:27.855 --> 43:29.773
- Nothing.
- Why did you chug that?

43:30.274 --> 43:32.151
- That's my drink.
- Are you crying?

43:32.151 --> 43:33.902
- Hey, what's going on?

43:33.902 --> 43:35.237
- Nothing.
- Talk to me.

43:36.113 --> 43:37.156
What happened?

43:37.156 --> 43:38.157
<i>What happened?</i>

43:38.157 --> 43:40.242
She cheated. That's what happened.

43:40.951 --> 43:44.330
After everything I've been going through,
she's off hooking up with Topper?

43:44.830 --> 43:48.250
- I mean, what the hell?
- Bro, I've been looking all over for you.

43:48.250 --> 43:51.378
And the clock's ticking. Let's just go.
We don't need them.

43:51.879 --> 43:53.672
Yo, let's get out of here.

43:56.008 --> 44:00.262
<i>♪ I fooled around and fell in love... ♪</i>

44:00.262 --> 44:03.974
John B, what are you doing?
Don't even think about it, dude.

44:03.974 --> 44:05.559
John B, get in the boat.

44:11.357 --> 44:12.191
Oh shit.

44:15.527 --> 44:17.488
- No, not right here, bro.
- No, no.

44:17.488 --> 44:18.614
- John B!
- Out of my way.

44:18.614 --> 44:20.908
- We're not doing this.
- Feel good about yourself?

44:20.908 --> 44:23.285
-  Stop!
- You need to chill out, bro.

44:23.285 --> 44:25.913
- I'm not ruining their party.
- That's what you're worried about?

44:25.913 --> 44:27.748
- I would walk away.
- Feel good about yourself?

44:27.748 --> 44:29.750
For once in your life,

44:29.750 --> 44:32.961
would you please just turn around
and walk away?

44:34.129 --> 44:35.130
Please.

44:35.881 --> 44:36.715
Look at me.

44:38.425 --> 44:39.426
Please don't.

44:41.011 --> 44:43.681
- Hey, no hard feelings, bro.
-  Topper.

44:45.557 --> 44:46.517
We good?

44:48.769 --> 44:51.188
- No. John B, no!

44:53.232 --> 44:55.442
-  You like that shit, Top?
- Jesus.

44:55.442 --> 44:57.611
-  Huh? Huh?

44:57.611 --> 45:00.072
-  Stop, John B!
-  John B.

45:00.072 --> 45:02.700
- Stop! What are you doing? No!
- You ready for this?

45:03.534 --> 45:05.786
Hey, stop! What are you doing?

45:05.786 --> 45:07.663
John B! Mr. Carrera!

45:07.663 --> 45:09.331
- John B!
- Hey! Hey, hey!

45:09.331 --> 45:11.667
- Hey! Get out of here!
-  Get him out of here.

45:11.667 --> 45:13.877
- Get out of here.
- Is that what you want, Mike?

45:13.877 --> 45:16.672
- Get off of him.
- That's what I'm talking about!

45:16.672 --> 45:19.883
- Both of you get out of here!
- You happy, Sarah?

45:20.592 --> 45:23.303
- Topper?
-  Do you need a doctor?

45:23.303 --> 45:26.390
- He wasn't defending himself.
-  We need a medic. Call 911.

45:26.390 --> 45:29.268
-  Please, back up!
- Don't move your head, Topper.

45:30.561 --> 45:31.854
Stay with me.

45:31.854 --> 45:33.230
Go and get help.

45:41.905 --> 45:44.074
<i>Why do people do the things they do?</i>

45:44.074 --> 45:46.869
She's a cheater.
That's who she is. I should've known.

45:46.869 --> 45:48.287
Any idea what you just did?

45:48.287 --> 45:52.249
<i>I guess it's not really the "why"
that I'm most interested in.</i>

45:53.000 --> 45:54.334
<i>It's another question.</i>

45:56.170 --> 45:58.505
<i>How far can you go down the wrong path...</i>

46:00.716 --> 46:03.010
<i>before it's too late
to get on the right one?</i>

46:07.765 --> 46:09.850
<i>Yeah, this was
all our old family history.</i>

46:09.850 --> 46:11.477
They kept it from me.

46:12.603 --> 46:13.562
My dad too.

46:19.026 --> 46:20.444
This is my mee-maw.

46:21.278 --> 46:23.655
She was the one who knew we were Tannys.

46:25.199 --> 46:26.283
She's sweet.

46:26.867 --> 46:28.452
Remind me of my granny.

46:29.077 --> 46:30.579
She held us all together.

46:32.998 --> 46:35.250
All right, let's keep looking.

46:43.425 --> 46:44.510
See anything?

46:50.390 --> 46:53.352
Is this that Tanny guy
who owned that lake house I lived in?

46:53.352 --> 46:55.437
Yeah, it's Denmark Tanny.
You know the story.

46:55.437 --> 46:57.731
Fugitive slave turned landowner.

46:58.482 --> 47:00.442
He had three sons who survived him.

47:06.615 --> 47:08.075
Did he have a daughter too?

47:12.079 --> 47:13.163
Let me see that.

47:14.957 --> 47:15.999
Wheat symbol.

47:17.125 --> 47:18.210
Clarice Tanny.

47:19.419 --> 47:24.633
Yeah. Yeah, this was the daughter.
She was raised in the Limbrey plantation.

47:24.633 --> 47:27.386
Wait, we have a family tree
in here somewhere.

47:28.387 --> 47:30.556
I don't even know where to start looking.

47:33.100 --> 47:34.101
Hold on.

47:39.565 --> 47:40.983
Ha! Bingo.

47:49.992 --> 47:50.993
Here she is.

47:52.494 --> 47:53.412
Clarice Tanny.

47:54.788 --> 47:56.623
He must have sent this to her.

47:56.623 --> 47:58.917
But look, it's never been opened.

47:59.918 --> 48:00.919
Should I open it?

48:01.503 --> 48:03.338
You see anyone here who can stop us?

48:03.338 --> 48:04.381
Open it.

48:16.101 --> 48:17.603
"Dearest Clarice,

48:17.603 --> 48:20.898
I apologize for writing the letter
which will most likely reach you

48:20.898 --> 48:22.566
after my death."

48:23.525 --> 48:24.610
It's from Denmark.

48:25.485 --> 48:27.112
"I also apologize,

48:27.112 --> 48:30.157
I've never met you, and I'm your father."

48:31.325 --> 48:32.951
They never let him see her.

48:34.411 --> 48:36.872
He's talking about her brothers,

48:36.872 --> 48:38.457
the family legacy,

48:39.041 --> 48:40.417
and the Royal Merchant.

48:41.293 --> 48:44.004
"The priest was often delirious,
but in a moment of clarity,

48:44.004 --> 48:47.299
he spoke of an idol and a city of gold."

48:51.303 --> 48:52.888
"I believed it to be

48:52.888 --> 48:54.640
the rantings of his fever but..."

49:04.900 --> 49:05.901
Oh my God.
