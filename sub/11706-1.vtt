{\an8}- IT'LL BE FUN.

15:45.653 --> 15:46.695
{\an8}- THEY [bleep]ED IT UP.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.030
{\an8}YEAH, THEY [bleep]ED IT UP.

15:48.113 --> 15:51.033
{\an8}SO NOW IT'S PAULY AND VINNY
AND US THREE.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.826
{\an8}- WELL, GOOD. SO THE GOOD PEOPLE
ARE DOWNSTAIRS.

15:52.910 --> 15:53.744
{\an8}- YEAH.

15:53.827 --> 15:56.205
{\an8}- AND THE [bleep]ERS
ARE UPSTAIRS.

15:56.288 --> 15:59.333
{\an8}I'M A LITTLE PISSED OFF BECAUSE
RON AND SAM GOT THAT ROOM.

15:59.416 --> 16:01.543
{\an8}BUT JENNI IS A DOLL,
AND SHE PICKED THE ROOM

16:01.627 --> 16:02.628
{\an8}WITH THREE BEDS.

16:02.711 --> 16:06.423
{\an8}OH, YEAH. OH, YEAH.
OH, YEAH.

16:06.507 --> 16:08.467
{\an8}THANK GOD, BECAUSE IF I DIDN'T
LIVE WITH ONE OF THOSE TWO,

16:08.550 --> 16:11.387
{\an8}I'D PROBABLY KILL MYSELF.

16:14.598 --> 16:15.391
{\an8}WHAT'S UP, BITCHES?

16:15.474 --> 16:16.892

16:21.772 --> 16:22.981
{\an8}- WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HER?

16:23.065 --> 16:24.483
{\an8}- SHE LOOKS LIKE A GREMLIN.

16:24.566 --> 16:26.610
{\an8}- I THOUGHT SHE WAS
GONNA BE HOT.

16:26.694 --> 16:29.905
{\an8}AND I'M A LITTLE--I'M A LITTLE
TAKEN ABACK, RIGHT?

16:29.988 --> 16:32.074
{\an8}I'M IN THIS HOUSE
WITH NOW THREE GIRLS,

16:32.157 --> 16:34.243
{\an8}AND APPARENTLY DEENA KNOWS
SNOOKI FROM HOME,

16:34.326 --> 16:35.577
{\an8}SO THEY'RE BFF.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.705
{\an8}AND NOW IT'S THREE

16:37.788 --> 16:39.415
{\an8}SNOOKI'S [bleep]ING

{\an8}IT'S ME AGAINST
THIS WHOLE HOUSE.

16:42.668 --> 16:45.754
{\an8}DO YOU GET THAT?

16:45.838 --> 16:48.090
{\an8}- WHAT ARE THE SITUATIONS

{\an8}- YOU'RE UPSTAIRS.

{\an8}- JUST LOOKING AT MIKE,

16:51.301 --> 16:54.513
{\an8}YOU SEE "MISERABLE"
TATTOOED ON HIS FOREHEAD.

16:54.596 --> 16:57.349
{\an8}THAT'S A BAD SITUATION.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.935
{\an8}HE [bleep]ED MY BEST FRIEND
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

17:00.018 --> 17:00.978

{\an8}I'M ON A TWO-MONTH DRY SPELL.

17:17.202 --> 17:17.703
{\an8}I HAVEN'T HAD SEX
IN TWO MONTHS.

17:17.786 --> 17:18.871
{\an8}THERE'S NOT A CHANCE.

17:18.954 --> 17:21.498
{\an8}THERE'S NOT A CHANCE
IT'S HAPPENING.

17:21.582 --> 17:25.794
{\an8}SO HOPEFULLY
I'LL FIND SOMEBODY.

17:25.877 --> 17:27.128
{\an8}- DO YOU WANT TO SEE MINE?
I'LL SHOW YOU MINE.

17:27.212 --> 17:27.921
{\an8}- SHOW ME IT.
DO YOU HAVE THE RABBIT?

17:28.005 --> 17:29.131
{\an8}- I CALL MY VIBRATOR
THE ELMO,

17:29.214 --> 17:32.134
{\an8}BECAUSE "TICKLE ME, ELMO,"
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

17:32.217 --> 17:33.135
{\an8}- YES.

17:33.218 --> 17:36.805
{\an8}- SHE'S GREEN.

17:36.889 --> 17:39.224
{\an8}- LISTEN, HONEY,

17:39.308 --> 17:40.392
{\an8}- [laughs]

17:40.476 --> 17:41.810
{\an8}- BUT, YOU KNOW, I HAVE VINNY
IN THE HOUSE NOW,

17:41.894 --> 17:42.561
{\an8}SO MAYBE I DON'T NEED
THE VIBRATOR.

17:42.644 --> 17:43.645
{\an8}WE'LL SEE.

17:43.729 --> 17:46.398
{\an8}I LOVE THIS ROOM.

{\an8}- I ACTUALLY FEEL
BAD FOR MIKE

{\an8}BECAUSE HE REALLY GOT
THE [bleep] END OF THE STICK.

18:35.155 --> 18:37.699
{\an8}NOBODY WANTED TO ROOM
WITH RON AND SAM.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.117
{\an8}- WHAT IS IT?
WHERE IS IT AT?

18:39.201 --> 18:40.244
{\an8}- SAM'S OLD BEDROOM.

{\an8}IT'S SAM'S OLD BED?

18:42.037 --> 18:44.373
{\an8}- UNFORTUNATELY, IT COULD HAVE
BEEN MVP IN THAT ROOM.

18:44.456 --> 18:45.874
{\an8}UH, MIKEY-VINNY-PAULY.

18:45.958 --> 18:49.044
{\an8}WHY RON AND SAM WOULD PICK
A ROOM WITH THREE BEDS,

18:49.127 --> 18:53.257

{\an8}THAT'S HOW I LIKE MY WOMEN.

19:19.199 --> 19:20.868

HIT ME!

32:34.619 --> 32:37.121
{\an8}- WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

32:37.205 --> 32:38.289
{\an8}WE'RE GONNA
WAKE THEM UP.

32:38.373 --> 32:40.541
{\an8}- UH, I'M NOT GOING UPSTAIRS.

32:40.625 --> 32:41.584
{\an8}SHE'S ON CRACK
IF SHE GOES UPSTAIRS.

32:41.668 --> 32:44.212
{\an8}- SHE'S REALLY DRUNK,
I GUESS.

32:44.295 --> 32:45.546
{\an8}I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF SHE'S DRUNK

32:45.630 --> 32:47.256
{\an8}OR IF SHE'S JUST--
- STUPID?

32:47.340 --> 32:49.175
{\an8}- WHATEVER, YEAH.
- I'M GONNA GO WITH STUPID.

32:49.258 --> 32:51.594
{\an8}- [laughs]

32:51.678 --> 32:55.932
{\an8}- NOBODY HAS EVER, EVER GOTTEN
BUTT, BUTT, BUTT NAKED.

32:56.015 --> 32:56.891
{\an8}SHE DID.

32:56.974 --> 33:00.311
{\an8}- [laughs]

33:00.395 --> 33:03.064
{\an8}- MIKE, YOU HAVE [bleep],
ALL RIGHT?

33:03.147 --> 33:03.773
{\an8}WAKE THE [bleep] UP.

33:03.856 --> 33:06.150
{\an8}- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WAKE UP?

33:06.234 --> 33:09.904
{\an8}- WAKE UP.
- FOR WHAT?

33:09.987 --> 33:10.571
{\an8}- YOU COULD TELL.
SHE'S LIKE, "MIKE,"

33:10.655 --> 33:13.199
{\an8}LIKE, ALL ON HIS BED.

33:13.282 --> 33:14.242
{\an8}LIKE--LIKE A SNOOKI.

33:14.325 --> 33:15.410
{\an8}LIKE, IT REMINDED ME
OF LIKE

33:15.493 --> 33:16.577
{\an8}HOW SNOOKI WOULD BE,

33:16.661 --> 33:17.620
{\an8}GOING INTO, LIKE,
THE GUY'S ROOM.

33:17.704 --> 33:18.913
{\an8}- UHH! YOU'RE ANNOYING.

33:18.996 --> 33:20.248
{\an8}- YEAH. YOU'RE ANNOYING.

33:20.331 --> 33:24.669
{\an8}- [laughs]

33:24.752 --> 33:26.379
{\an8}- I WAS DRUNK.
I WANTED TO SNUGGLE.

33:26.462 --> 33:27.588
{\an8}NOTHING, LIKE, CRAZY.

33:27.672 --> 33:29.757
{\an8}LIKE, I REALLY
JUST WANTED TO SNUGGLE,

33:29.841 --> 33:31.426
{\an8}AND THIS BITCH LAUGHS.

33:31.509 --> 33:33.302
{\an8}- NO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.

33:33.386 --> 33:35.304
{\an8}- NO, I'M FINE.

33:35.388 --> 33:38.099
{\an8}- GOOD NIGHT.

33:38.182 --> 33:39.225
{\an8}- COME CUDDLE WITH ME.

33:39.308 --> 33:42.437
{\an8}- [laughs]

33:42.520 --> 33:43.938
{\an8}- BITCH,

33:44.021 --> 33:45.690
{\an8}I WILL SMACK THAT [bleep]ING
GRIN RIGHT OFF YOUR FACE.

33:45.773 --> 33:46.607
{\an8}SERIOUSLY.

33:46.691 --> 33:47.734
{\an8}SHE'S LAUGHING AT ME.

33:47.817 --> 33:48.860
{\an8}- SHE'S NOT LAUGHING
AT YOU.

33:48.943 --> 33:49.652
{\an8}- SHE IS.
- NO, SHE'S NOT.

33:49.736 --> 33:51.696
{\an8}- I DEFINITELY AM.

33:51.779 --> 33:53.322
{\an8}- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
TO YOU.

33:53.406 --> 33:54.741
{\an8}- OKAY.

33:54.824 --> 33:56.576
{\an8}- I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS
WITH YOU EVER.

33:56.659 --> 33:57.618
{\an8}- OKAY.

33:57.702 --> 34:00.496
{\an8}- AND NOW I DO.

34:00.580 --> 34:02.874
{\an8}- HELLO!

34:02.957 --> 34:05.293
{\an8}- AND SO DOES
EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE HOUSE.

34:05.376 --> 34:05.752
{\an8}- COOL.

34:05.835 --> 34:06.544
{\an8}- THAT'S COOL.

34:06.627 --> 34:08.588
{\an8}- [laughs]

34:09.672 --> 34:12.632
{\an8}- THEY'RE EMBARRASSING,
AND SAMMI'S A [bleep].

34:12.717 --> 34:14.051
{\an8}- WHY?
- AND THAT'S ALL.

34:14.135 --> 34:16.012
{\an8}- [laughs]

34:16.094 --> 34:16.679
{\an8}- YOU WANT TO WALK
OUT OF MY ROOM,

34:16.763 --> 34:19.098
{\an8}CALLING ME A [bleep].

34:19.181 --> 34:21.641
{\an8}CAN'T SAY IT TO MY FACE.
HELL YEAH.

34:21.726 --> 34:22.685
{\an8}I HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH YOU NOW.

34:22.768 --> 34:24.771
{\an8}- WHAT HAPPENED?
- SHE'S LIKE A [bleep] IN A BAG.

34:24.853 --> 34:26.981
{\an8}I TRIED TO BE NICE
TO THIS GIRL.

34:27.065 --> 34:27.899
{\an8}- WHO?

34:27.982 --> 34:29.650
{\an8}- I HOPE SHE ROTS IN HELL.

34:29.734 --> 34:31.068
{\an8}I DO.

34:31.152 --> 34:32.612
{\an8}I WILL [bleep]ING
KNOCK HER OUT.

34:32.695 --> 34:33.821
{\an8}- TALK ALL YOU WANT.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.156
{\an8}- WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT'D I MISS?

34:35.239 --> 34:39.076
{\an8}- HAVE I DONE ANYTHING WRONG,
BEING IN THIS HOUSE?

34:39.159 --> 34:40.453
{\an8}- WE'VE BEEN HERE, LIKE,
FOR FIVE HOURS.

34:40.536 --> 34:41.661
{\an8}- I DON'T CARE.

34:41.746 --> 34:42.789
{\an8}- THAT WAS VERY AWKWARD,

34:42.871 --> 34:45.875
{\an8}VERY AUDACIOUS OF A ROOKIE...

34:45.958 --> 34:47.168
{\an8}- WHAT DOES AUDACIOUS MEAN?

34:47.251 --> 34:48.293
{\an8}- IN CALLING A VETERAN--

34:48.377 --> 34:50.505
{\an8}- I DON'T REALLY
[bleep]ING CARE.

34:50.588 --> 34:52.672
{\an8}- I CAN'T BELIEVE DEENA
CALLED SAMMI THE "C" WORD

34:52.757 --> 34:53.674
{\an8}ON THE FIRST NIGHT.

34:53.757 --> 34:55.009
{\an8}IT'S THE FIRST NIGHT.

34:55.092 --> 34:56.052
{\an8}THOSE ARE FIGHTING WORDS.

34:56.135 --> 34:57.428
{\an8}- YOU ARE THE BLAST
FROM THE PAST.

34:57.512 --> 34:58.596
{\an8}- DON'T TELL ME WHO I AM.

34:58.679 --> 35:00.556
{\an8}WHAT IS IT,
THE BLAST IN A CUP?

35:00.640 --> 35:03.184
{\an8}I AM PUTTING YOU UP FOR
ROOKIE OF THE YEAR AWARD.

35:03.267 --> 35:05.478
{\an8}YOU ARE GOING FOR ROOKIE
OF THE YEAR AWARD.

35:05.561 --> 35:08.231
{\an8}NOT ONLY WERE YOU BUTT NAKED
ON THE FIRST DAY--

35:08.314 --> 35:09.607
{\an8}- YOU DO NOT TALK TO ME.

35:09.690 --> 35:12.068
{\an8}LIKE, I AM A GOOD PERSON
TO EVERYBODY,

35:12.151 --> 35:12.860
{\an8}BUT IF YOU
WANT TO LAUGH AT ME

35:12.944 --> 35:14.111
{\an8}AND MAKE FUN OF ME--
- YEAH.

35:14.195 --> 35:16.072
{\an8}- I WILL [bleep]ING
MAKE YOUR LIFE MISERABLE.

35:16.155 --> 35:17.448
{\an8}- WHAT HOLIDAY IS IT?
HALLOWEEN?

35:17.532 --> 35:20.535
{\an8}- I LOVE HOW SHE'S NOT SAYING
ONE WORD TO MY FACE.

35:20.618 --> 35:23.120
{\an8}[laughs]
- SHE'S JUST LIKE SNOOKI.

35:23.204 --> 35:25.498
{\an8}- I'M SITTING IN BED, I KIND OF
WAS LIKE BRUSHING IT OFF,

35:25.581 --> 35:26.749
{\an8}AND THEN I SAY, NO.

35:26.833 --> 35:29.043
{\an8}- THIS BITCH, THIS BITCH.

35:29.126 --> 35:32.463
{\an8}GOOD, GO CUDDLE
WITH YOUR [bleep]ING BOYFRIEND.

35:32.547 --> 35:33.714
{\an8}DON'T TALK TO ME.
- LISTEN.

35:33.798 --> 35:36.676
{\an8}LISTEN, LISTEN, LISTEN,
LISTEN, LISTEN, LISTEN.

35:36.759 --> 35:38.678
{\an8}- THEN RON JUMPS UP
TO GO DOWNSTAIRS,

35:38.761 --> 35:39.554
{\an8}AND I'M LIKE, WHO DOES
THIS GIRL THINK SHE IS?

35:39.637 --> 35:42.056
{\an8}- LISTEN, LISTEN.
DON'T--NO, NO, NO.

35:42.139 --> 35:44.267
{\an8}DON'T GET ME [bleep]ING
INVOLVED, ALL RIGHT, DEENA?

35:44.350 --> 35:46.894
{\an8}YOU COME INTO THIS HOUSE,
THIS IS MY [bleep]ING HOUSE!

35:46.978 --> 35:47.979
{\an8}LISTEN, BITCH,
YOU DON'T [bleep]ING KNOW ME.

35:48.062 --> 35:49.897
{\an8}YOU'RE IN MY [bleep]ING HOUSE.

35:49.981 --> 35:51.023
{\an8}YOU JUST WALKED
THROUGH THE DOOR.

35:51.107 --> 35:51.983
{\an8}YOU EARN RESPECT
IN THIS [bleep]ING HOUSE.

35:52.066 --> 35:54.110
{\an8}YOU DON'T [bleep]ING
JUST GET IT.

35:54.193 --> 35:55.736
{\an8}NO, DON'T GET ME
[bleep]ING INVOLVED!

35:55.820 --> 35:56.821
{\an8}- I'M NOT!

35:56.904 --> 35:58.239
{\an8}- YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH
MY [bleep]ING GIRLFRIEND,

35:58.322 --> 35:59.907
{\an8}YOU DEAL WITH IT WITH HER,
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

35:59.991 --> 36:01.909
{\an8}I'M UPSTAIRS--NO, NO, NO.
I'M NOT DONE TALKING!

36:01.993 --> 36:04.662
{\an8}I'M NOT DONE TALKING!
I'M NOT DONE TALKING, OKAY?

36:04.745 --> 36:06.497
{\an8}WHEN I'M DONE, YOU CAN TALK.
THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS.

36:06.581 --> 36:08.583
{\an8}ALL RIGHT?

36:12.879 --> 36:13.754
{\an8}- WHAT HAPPENED?
- THIS BITCH.

36:13.838 --> 36:16.257
{\an8}GO CUDDLE
WITH YOUR [bleep]ING BOYFRIEND.

36:16.340 --> 36:17.925
{\an8}- LISTEN, LISTEN, LISTEN.

36:18.009 --> 36:20.136
{\an8}DON'T GET ME [bleep]ING
INVOLVED, ALL RIGHT, DEENA?

36:20.219 --> 36:22.555
{\an8}SHE JUST KEPT TALKING [bleep],
SO I GOT UP

36:22.638 --> 36:24.056
{\an8}AND I GAVE HER
A PIECE OF MY MIND.

36:24.140 --> 36:25.766
{\an8}I'M UPSTAIRS--NO, NO, NO.
I'M NOT DONE TALKING!

36:25.850 --> 36:27.518
{\an8}WHEN I'M DONE, YOU CAN TALK.
THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS.

36:27.602 --> 36:28.728
{\an8}- YEAH, GO AHEAD.

36:28.811 --> 36:29.854
{\an8}- YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH
MY [bleep]ING GIRLFRIEND,

36:29.937 --> 36:31.898
{\an8}YOU DEAL WITH IT WITH HER,
SO SHUT THE [bleep] UP!

36:31.981 --> 36:32.648
{\an8}- OKAY, BUT SHE'S NOW
LAUGHING AT ME.

36:32.732 --> 36:36.944
{\an8}- BECAUSE--

36:37.028 --> 36:40.448
{\an8}- NO, NO, NO, NO.
GET OFF OF ME!

36:40.531 --> 36:41.282
{\an8}- I THOUGHT IT WAS
SUCH A [bleep] MOVE

36:41.365 --> 36:42.533
{\an8}WHEN RONNIE CAME DOWN
FOR SAMMI.

36:42.617 --> 36:45.995
{\an8}LIKE, LET YOUR GIRLFRIEND DO HER
FIGHTING BATTLES ON HER OWN.

36:46.078 --> 36:48.748
{\an8}DON'T TALK TO ME THE WAY
YOU'RE TALKING TO ME,

36:48.831 --> 36:51.250
{\an8}FIRST OF ALL!
AND SECOND OF ALL--

36:51.334 --> 36:52.710
{\an8}- [imitates Deena's voice]
FIRST OF ALL, SECOND OF ALL.

36:52.793 --> 36:53.878
{\an8}- I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE!

36:53.961 --> 36:55.004
{\an8}- [monotone]
I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE.

36:55.087 --> 36:56.255
{\an8}- SO GO UPSTAIRS.

36:56.339 --> 36:57.965
{\an8}- I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU THINK YOU ARE.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.592
{\an8}- YOU DON'T--
JUST GO TO SLEEP.

36:59.675 --> 37:02.053
{\an8}- DEENA KIND OF REMINDED ME OF,
LIKE, A DIRTY CHIHUAHUA,

37:02.136 --> 37:04.889
{\an8}JUST BARKING,
AND, LIKE, YOU KIND OF

37:04.972 --> 37:05.848
{\an8}JUST WANT TO SMACK IT
TO THE SIDE.

37:05.932 --> 37:07.099
{\an8}- I'D RATHER HAVE
[bleep]ING ANGELINA BACK.

37:07.183 --> 37:08.392
{\an8}- HOLD ON A SECOND.

37:08.476 --> 37:10.645
{\an8}DON'T WALK OUT OF MY ROOM
CALLING ME A [bleep].

37:10.728 --> 37:13.356
{\an8}- YOU LAUGHED AT ME
FOR NO REASON!

37:13.439 --> 37:15.274
{\an8}GET REAL!

37:15.358 --> 37:17.151
{\an8}- I'M STILL LAUGHING
AT YOU.

37:17.234 --> 37:18.277
{\an8}- WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?
- I'M TALKING TO YOU.

37:18.361 --> 37:20.154
{\an8}DIANA, DEENA, WHATEVER
THE [bleep] YOUR NAME IS.

37:20.237 --> 37:22.990
{\an8}- YEAH. I DIDN'T
START WITH YOU!

37:23.074 --> 37:25.326
{\an8}- YOU'RE THE NEW GIRL.
SHUT UP, YOU STUPID [bleep].

37:25.409 --> 37:27.161
{\an8}- OOH, HERE IT COMES.
- YOU FUCKING [bleep]!

37:27.244 --> 37:31.123
{\an8}- [Bleep] YOU!
[Bleep] YOU! [Bleep] YOU!

37:31.207 --> 37:32.875
{\an8}- YOU DON'T WANT TO PISS OFF
DEENA LIKE THAT,

37:32.959 --> 37:35.169
{\an8}BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH
WE'RE TINY BITCHES,

37:35.252 --> 37:36.420
{\an8}I DON'T GIVE A [bleep].

37:36.504 --> 37:39.131
{\an8}I WILL [bleep]ING ATTACK YOU
LIKE A SQUIRREL MONKEY.

37:39.215 --> 37:41.759
{\an8}SAM, YOU WERE SUCH A BITCH.

37:41.842 --> 37:43.803
{\an8}YOU'RE A [bleep],
THE BIGGEST BITCH

37:43.886 --> 37:45.096
{\an8}I'VE EVER MET
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

37:45.179 --> 37:47.848
{\an8}YOU ARE THE BIGGEST
[bleep]ING BITCH.

37:47.932 --> 37:53.104
{\an8}I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU EVEN HAVE FRIENDS.

37:53.187 --> 37:54.855
{\an8}YOU ARE THE BIGGEST BITCH.

37:54.939 --> 37:57.191
{\an8}- I'M HERE AND I'M STAYING,

37:57.274 --> 37:58.442
{\an8}WHETHER YOU LIKE IT
OR NOT.

37:58.526 --> 38:02.238
{\an8}- YOU ARE A [bleep]ING
SLUTTY-ASSED BITCH!

38:02.321 --> 38:03.280
{\an8}- THANK YOU.

38:03.364 --> 38:04.490
{\an8}- YOU DON'T GIVE A [bleep]

38:04.573 --> 38:05.783
{\an8}ABOUT ANYBODY ELSE
BUT YOURSELF.

38:05.866 --> 38:07.076
{\an8}- I KNEW,
COMING INTO THIS HOUSE,

38:07.159 --> 38:09.412
{\an8}THAT THERE WAS UNFINISHED DRAMA
BETWEEN SAMMI AND THE GIRLS.

38:09.495 --> 38:12.289
{\an8}I JUST DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS GONNA COME OUT LIKE THIS,

38:12.373 --> 38:13.708
{\an8}AND I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS GONNA
HAPPEN ON THE FIRST DAY.

38:13.791 --> 38:16.836
{\an8}- YOU'RE NOT A TRUE FRIEND.
YOU'RE A BACKSTABBING BITCH.

38:16.919 --> 38:18.879
{\an8}YOU SHOWED IT TO ME
IN [bleep]ING MIAMI,

38:18.963 --> 38:20.089
{\an8}YOU [bleep]ING BITCH!

38:20.172 --> 38:21.924
{\an8}YOU WERE FAKE AS [bleep]!

38:22.008 --> 38:23.050
{\an8}YOU PRETENDED TO BE
MY [bleep]ING FRIEND,

38:23.134 --> 38:24.427
{\an8}AND YOU [bleep]ING WEREN'T
EVEN TELLING ME YOURSELF.

38:24.510 --> 38:25.928
{\an8}- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

38:26.012 --> 38:28.556
{\an8}- I AM DEAD SERIOUS,
YOU [bleep] FAKE BITCH!

38:28.639 --> 38:30.307
{\an8}RON, IS SHE FAKE?
DO YOU THINK SHE'S FAKE?

38:30.391 --> 38:32.560
{\an8}I'M ASKING YOU.
- YEAH, SHE'S FAKE.

38:32.643 --> 38:35.521
{\an8}- OKAY, RONNIE, YOUR MOM CALLED
ME EVERY SINGLE [bleep]ING WEEK!

38:35.604 --> 38:40.359
{\an8}"WHY THE [bleep] IS MY SON
WITH THIS BONY-ASSED BITCH?"

38:40.443 --> 38:42.403
{\an8}I MIGHT HAVE FABRICATED
A LITTLE BIT,

38:42.486 --> 38:46.532
{\an8}SAYING THAT RONNIE'S MOM SAID
THAT SAM IS A BITCH,

38:46.615 --> 38:50.453
{\an8}BUT WHEN I SAID IT,
RON DIDN'T SAY A WORD.

38:50.536 --> 38:53.998
{\an8}- LIKE, HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU THINK YOU ARE, SNOOKI,

38:54.081 --> 38:55.541
{\an8}BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU WOULD
EVEN SAY THINGS LIKE THAT.

38:55.624 --> 38:58.753
{\an8}- EVEN THOUGH I DON'T LIKE YOU,
WELL, I WILL ALWAYS LOVE RONNIE.

38:58.836 --> 38:59.879
{\an8}- HE DOESN'T EVEN
[bleep]ING LIKE YOU.

38:59.962 --> 39:00.963
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, SNOOK,
YOU NEED TO RELAX,

39:01.047 --> 39:02.798
