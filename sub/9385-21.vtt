WEBVTT

00:01.168 --> 00:02.503
Hi, I'm Brian Griffin.

00:02.586 --> 00:03.670
And I'm Stewart.

00:03.754 --> 00:05.464
Many of you have written to the show

00:05.547 --> 00:07.341
with suggestions
for episodes you'd like to see.

00:07.424 --> 00:08.884
They're mostly god-awful.

00:08.967 --> 00:11.011
( laugh track plays )

00:11.094 --> 00:12.554
Well, tonight, we took your advice

00:12.638 --> 00:14.306
and produced three
of our favorite suggestions.

00:14.389 --> 00:15.933
"Favorites." Oh, that's charitable.

00:16.016 --> 00:18.101
( plays laugh track )

00:18.185 --> 00:20.312
-What is that?
-Oh, I got this from Dharma & Greg.

00:20.395 --> 00:21.647
Oh, I'm surprised
there's anything left in it.

00:21.730 --> 00:23.524
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

00:23.607 --> 00:24.608
Enjoy.

00:24.733 --> 00:28.362
It seems today that all you see

00:28.445 --> 00:31.740
Is violence in movies and sex on TV

00:31.823 --> 00:35.118
But where are those good
old-fashioned values

00:35.202 --> 00:38.038
On which we used to rely?

00:38.121 --> 00:41.500
Lucky there's a family guy

00:41.583 --> 00:45.212
Lucky there's a man who positively can do

00:45.295 --> 00:46.713
All the things that make us

00:46.797 --> 00:48.298
Laugh and cry

00:48.382 --> 00:53.387
He's... a... fam... ily... guy!

01:03.480 --> 01:06.066
And now back to The Newlywed Game.

01:06.149 --> 01:08.569
Oh, Carol, how did Nick
answer the following:

01:08.652 --> 01:11.822
"The last thing I would ever
give my wife is 'blank.'"

01:12.030 --> 01:13.448
A little spending money?

01:13.532 --> 01:14.575
( laugh track plays )

01:14.658 --> 01:16.368
I'm sorry, that's incorrect.

01:16.451 --> 01:17.494
Nick actually said...

01:19.121 --> 01:21.456
Nick, what are you talking about?

01:21.540 --> 01:23.083
Oh, Meg, you were right.

01:25.794 --> 01:28.005
Oh, my god! A genie!

01:28.088 --> 01:30.007
I am here to grant you three wishes.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.925
Hey, uh... three wishes?!

01:32.009 --> 01:33.844
Oh, this is so exciting!

01:33.927 --> 01:34.928
I want a new hat!

01:35.012 --> 01:36.013
I want a new hat!

01:36.096 --> 01:37.264
I want them to have new hats.

01:37.347 --> 01:38.974
Kids, these are your father's wishes.

01:39.057 --> 01:40.517
Go ahead, honey, get whatever you want.

01:40.601 --> 01:41.977
Oh, that's easy.

01:42.060 --> 01:44.479
I wish I could see
what Kelly Ripa was like off the set.

01:44.563 --> 01:46.440
So it shall be.

01:48.025 --> 01:49.526
Great show today, Kelly.

01:49.610 --> 01:50.736
Thanks, Reege. You, too.

01:56.366 --> 01:58.410
REGIS:
Hey, Kelly, Gellman needs us on stage

01:58.493 --> 01:59.828
for a couple of reshoots.

01:59.912 --> 02:01.038
Be right there, Reege.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.456
I just have to put on my face.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.374
My goodness, did you see

02:04.458 --> 02:06.001
the size of that dressing room?

02:06.084 --> 02:07.628
Yes, they must really want to keep her.

02:07.711 --> 02:08.837
Your second wish?

02:08.921 --> 02:10.589
I got just the thing.

02:10.672 --> 02:12.841
I wish I had my own theme music.

02:12.925 --> 02:14.134
Done.

02:17.095 --> 02:18.555
I don't hear anything.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.098
Get up. Try it out.

02:20.182 --> 02:22.059
( harp arpeggio plays )

02:22.142 --> 02:24.561
( dramatic orchestra movements)

02:24.645 --> 02:28.607
( sprightly music playing )

02:28.732 --> 02:30.275
Swee-eet!

02:32.069 --> 02:33.445
( harp plays )

02:33.529 --> 02:35.113
( theme music playing )

02:44.915 --> 02:47.835
( dramatic music playing)

02:50.045 --> 02:52.589
( sprightly music playing )

02:57.886 --> 02:59.972
( Barry White playing )

03:00.055 --> 03:01.974
Yah-yah-yah-yah.

03:02.057 --> 03:04.309
( both giggling )

03:06.270 --> 03:08.939
( music playing )

03:09.022 --> 03:11.149
Hey, buddy, want to turn that stuff down?

03:11.233 --> 03:13.861
Aw, come on, pal, that's classic
traveling music, eh?

03:13.944 --> 03:15.237
Try to enjoy it.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.030
Riding on a bus, riding on a bus

03:17.114 --> 03:18.740
Sitting next to bums, there's an open seat

03:18.824 --> 03:19.825
Hope that isn't pee...

03:19.992 --> 03:21.493
Yeah, well, I'm sick of hearing it.

03:21.577 --> 03:23.787
Look, I'm sorry, buddy,
I can't turn it off.

03:23.871 --> 03:26.498
Well, then, I'm gonna
to break every bone in your body.

03:26.582 --> 03:27.708
I wish I had no bones.

03:27.791 --> 03:29.126
Done.

03:31.003 --> 03:32.462
That ought to show you.

03:32.546 --> 03:33.589
( laughing )

03:33.672 --> 03:34.673
( yells )

03:37.384 --> 03:38.802
Oh, no.

03:38.886 --> 03:42.097
I got to fart, but I don't know
which way to lean.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.727
Okay, now I know you guys
might be a little concerned

03:46.852 --> 03:48.270
about me not having bones and all

03:48.353 --> 03:50.606
but I got to tell you, it's not that bad.

03:50.689 --> 03:52.191
Dad's just like
Silly Putty.

03:52.274 --> 03:54.443
Look what I can do
to Mary Worth's

03:54.526 --> 03:55.861
smug sense of
self-satisfaction.

03:55.944 --> 03:57.154
( laughing )

03:57.237 --> 03:58.822
That's right, son.
Take her down a peg.

03:58.906 --> 04:01.783
Well, I guess we could
all adjust to this.

04:01.867 --> 04:04.077
Look, I'm making an angel.

04:04.161 --> 04:06.330
See, Lois, everything's
going to be fine.

04:06.413 --> 04:08.165
Now smile while I write
my name in you.

04:13.629 --> 04:15.506
( yelling )

04:16.965 --> 04:18.342
Let go!

04:21.178 --> 04:22.930
( Peter laughing )

04:23.013 --> 04:24.389
( yells )

04:26.308 --> 04:27.309
( grunts )

04:28.644 --> 04:30.812
( yelling )

04:32.981 --> 04:35.150
But, Mom, I've got to use
the bathroom now.

04:35.317 --> 04:36.985
Well, I'm sorry,
but your father

04:37.069 --> 04:39.321
gets incredibly filthy
rolling around everywhere.

04:39.404 --> 04:41.240
He just has to take
his 12 baths a day.

04:41.323 --> 04:42.908
I don't like Dad anymore.

04:42.991 --> 04:46.411
I invited some friends over
to jump on him like a trampoline

04:46.495 --> 04:48.997
but his roll of fat
sucked up Ryan's shoe

04:49.081 --> 04:51.625
and his mom yelled at him
when he got home

04:51.708 --> 04:53.961
and he beat me up at school
the next day.

04:54.044 --> 04:55.963
It's all here
in this pamphlet.

04:56.046 --> 04:58.257
Kids, we just have to learn
to accept this.

04:58.340 --> 05:00.175
Like one of those stories
on Dateline

05:00.259 --> 05:02.970
where a family member suffers
a horrible accident

05:03.053 --> 05:05.097
and becomes a burden
on everybody.

05:05.180 --> 05:08.100
Sure, they pretend to be happy,
but they're dead inside.

05:08.183 --> 05:09.351
They're dead.

05:09.434 --> 05:11.520
And that'll be
our lives, hmm?

05:11.603 --> 05:14.022
What a big boneless jerk I am.

05:14.106 --> 05:15.858
I might have screwed up my life

05:15.941 --> 05:18.777
but there's no reason I got
to keep screwing up theirs.

05:18.944 --> 05:21.655
Good-bye,
cruel, bone-filled world.

05:21.905 --> 05:24.032
( yelling )

05:28.453 --> 05:31.874
Oh, so this is where all
the waste and sewage winds up.

05:38.922 --> 05:40.591
Cut, and print.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.676
That's a wrap.
Great job, Peter.

05:42.759 --> 05:44.052
Are you coming
to the wrap party tonight?

05:44.136 --> 05:45.429
Aw, gee, I don't know.

05:45.512 --> 05:46.972
I got a stand-up
comedy class

05:47.055 --> 05:48.849
I'm taking at
The Learning Annex.

05:48.932 --> 05:51.143
Well, actually, I won't
be a stand-up comic

05:51.226 --> 05:53.312
I'll be more like an
amorphous blob comic.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.022
I gotta write
that one down!

05:55.105 --> 05:57.316
Nonsense! I'll have the studio
send a flatbed for you.

05:57.399 --> 05:58.775
See you at 8:00.

06:01.904 --> 06:03.447
( sighs )

06:08.744 --> 06:11.413
Peter, there's something I've been
wanting to say to you all evening.

06:11.496 --> 06:14.208
What's that, Mrs. Catherine
Zeta-Jones Douglas?

06:14.291 --> 06:16.168
I want to jump
your non-bones.

06:16.251 --> 06:18.170
Geez, I can't believe
I'm your type.

06:18.253 --> 06:19.671
Well, as you can
tell from my husband

06:19.755 --> 06:22.549
I've got a thing for
saggy, shapeless men.

06:22.633 --> 06:26.136
I'm married to Catherine Zeta-
Jones. Will you sleep with me?

06:26.220 --> 06:27.804
Oh, yeah, I'm going
to have to pass.

06:27.888 --> 06:30.390
But Louie Anderson's eating
the decorative soaps in the bathroom.

06:30.474 --> 06:32.309
Why don't you try him?

06:33.352 --> 06:34.520
Excuse me,
aren't you Peter

06:34.603 --> 06:35.896
the human stunt bag?

06:35.979 --> 06:37.564
Well, that all depends
on who's asking.

06:37.648 --> 06:40.067
I'm a doctor about to conduct
an experimental procedure

06:40.150 --> 06:41.485
to give bones to a jellyfish

06:41.568 --> 06:43.278
but I'd like to try it
on a human first.

06:43.362 --> 06:44.863
-Interested?
-Well, I don't know.

06:45.072 --> 06:46.073
Interested?

06:46.240 --> 06:47.282
Didn't you
just say that?

06:47.366 --> 06:48.367
-Yes.
-I'll do it!

06:49.660 --> 06:51.245
DOCTOR:
Well, Peter

06:51.328 --> 06:53.121
the operation
was a complete success.

06:53.205 --> 06:54.623
What are you going to do now?

06:54.706 --> 06:56.667
Well, the whole reason
I had the operation

06:56.750 --> 06:58.293
was so I could go
back to my family.

06:58.377 --> 06:59.461
But it's been so long.

06:59.545 --> 07:01.255
What if they don't love me
anymore?

07:01.338 --> 07:04.007
Peter, where do you think
all those bones came from?

07:04.091 --> 07:05.592
ALL:
Surprise!

07:05.676 --> 07:07.010
You mean...

07:07.094 --> 07:08.971
it's your bones
that are inside me?

07:09.054 --> 07:10.264
Well, mostly.

07:10.347 --> 07:11.932
We picked up a drifter
to fill in the torso.

07:12.015 --> 07:14.643
Well, like I always say:
"A family of freaks

07:14.726 --> 07:16.228
is better than no
family at all."

07:16.311 --> 07:17.771
Let's go home.

07:17.855 --> 07:19.606
You know what's
really weird?

07:19.690 --> 07:21.400
This was covered by my HMO.

07:34.746 --> 07:37.291
Hey, Terry, you dare
me to pop a wheelie in this thing?

07:37.374 --> 07:38.834
Well, that doesn't sound
safe at all

07:38.917 --> 07:39.918
but okay, I dare you.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.089
BOTH:
Whoo!

07:44.214 --> 07:45.382
Wow, that was great.

07:51.763 --> 07:52.764
Six.

07:52.848 --> 07:53.932
Six bats.

07:54.057 --> 07:56.310
Seven. Seven bats.

07:56.393 --> 07:58.228
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

07:58.312 --> 07:59.688
Hey, is the Count
a vampire?

07:59.771 --> 08:00.772
What's that?

08:00.856 --> 08:02.191
Well, he-he's got
those big fangs.

08:02.274 --> 08:04.067
Have-have they ever shown
him doing somebody in

08:04.151 --> 08:05.611
and then feeding
on them?

08:05.694 --> 08:08.155
You-you're asking if they've
ever done a Sesame Street

08:08.238 --> 08:09.948
in which the Count
kills somebody

08:10.073 --> 08:11.700
and then sucks their blood
for sustenance?

08:11.783 --> 08:13.452
-Yeah.
-No, they've never done that.

08:13.535 --> 08:14.536
Everybody come quick!

08:14.620 --> 08:15.829
There's something
out in the yard!

08:17.706 --> 08:19.166
It looks like the back
of a tanker truck.

08:19.249 --> 08:20.709
Wow.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.503
What do you think
is inside?

08:22.586 --> 08:24.713
-Maybe it's candy!
-Chris, no!

08:24.796 --> 08:25.923
Lo-Lo-Lois, Lois.

08:26.298 --> 08:27.382
Let him dream.

08:27.466 --> 08:29.301
( grunting )

08:29.384 --> 08:30.427
( yelling )

08:30.511 --> 08:32.012
Aah! What is this stuff?

08:32.095 --> 08:33.889
Some kind of nuclear waste.

08:33.972 --> 08:35.766
Tell me, does anyone else
feel a trifle queasy?

08:36.808 --> 08:37.851
( screaming )

08:37.935 --> 08:39.144
What? Do I have a boogie?

08:39.228 --> 08:40.229
( gasps )

08:40.312 --> 08:43.065
I say! It appears my cranium
has doubled in size.

08:47.277 --> 08:48.987
How delightful!

08:49.071 --> 08:50.822
This toxic stew seems
to have given me

08:50.906 --> 08:52.157
telekinetic abilities.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.244
( scream )

08:56.745 --> 08:58.914
Hey, I can make fire!

08:58.997 --> 09:00.707
Hey, Chris, Chris,
come here a second.

09:00.791 --> 09:02.000
This is going
to be hilarious.

09:02.084 --> 09:03.377
Okay, on the count
of three.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.921
One... two... three.

09:06.421 --> 09:07.714
( laughing )

09:07.840 --> 09:09.174
Do it again.

09:09.258 --> 09:11.677
( laughing )

09:11.844 --> 09:13.262
All right, everyone.

09:13.345 --> 09:15.389
Clearly, something very strange
has happened here.

09:15.472 --> 09:16.682
We each seem to have acquired

09:16.765 --> 09:19.017
superpowers
from that nuclear waste.

09:19.101 --> 09:20.602
We've been given a gift.

09:20.686 --> 09:23.397
And whether that gift
is Chris's fire-conjuring...

09:23.480 --> 09:24.898
Stewie's telekinesis...

09:24.982 --> 09:26.859
Brian's super speed.

09:26.942 --> 09:27.943
Ask me how
the Queen of England is.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.069
How's the Queen of...?

09:29.152 --> 09:30.195
She's great.

09:30.279 --> 09:31.530
...Peter's morphing
ability...

09:31.613 --> 09:34.491
Hey, Lois, I'm a wishing troll.

09:34.575 --> 09:35.826
( laughing )

09:35.909 --> 09:38.036
...my super strength...

09:38.120 --> 09:39.997
or Meg's, um...

09:40.080 --> 09:43.292
super amazing ability
to grow her fingernails...

09:44.334 --> 09:45.377
( sighs )

09:45.460 --> 09:46.587
...we have a responsibility

09:46.670 --> 09:48.088
to use these powers properly

09:48.172 --> 09:50.048
and not to abuse them
for personal gain.

09:50.132 --> 09:51.175
Understand?

09:51.258 --> 09:52.259
ALL:
Yes.

09:52.342 --> 09:53.343
-Mm-hmm.
-Got it.

09:57.097 --> 09:59.600
Oh, no,
I forgot the detergent.

09:59.683 --> 10:01.685
E-Excuse me, would you
watch him for a moment?

10:01.768 --> 10:03.353
Sure thing, ma'am.

10:03.562 --> 10:04.563
Whoa, there

10:04.646 --> 10:06.273
little guy, you got
to pay for that.

10:06.356 --> 10:08.525
Go suck a railroad spike,
I haven't got any money.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.152
Well, then, I'm afraid

10:10.235 --> 10:11.778
I'm going to have to
take it away from you.

10:12.863 --> 10:14.865
( screams of pain )

10:14.948 --> 10:18.035
Oh, God! Please, help me!

10:21.038 --> 10:22.122
Move it, you slowpoke!

10:22.206 --> 10:23.248
The light's green!

10:23.332 --> 10:24.499
( horn honking )

10:24.583 --> 10:26.168
What does that cloud
look like to you, honey?

10:26.251 --> 10:28.253
To me it looks like... rain.

10:28.337 --> 10:30.631
( laughs ):
I used that joke at work today.

10:30.714 --> 10:32.257
I'm the funniest guy
at the office.

10:32.341 --> 10:33.634
They say I should
do stand-up.

10:33.717 --> 10:35.219
Aah! This is insane!

10:36.303 --> 10:37.304
( grunts )

10:43.810 --> 10:45.062
( gasps )

10:45.145 --> 10:47.523
Oh, my God, Dad,
'N Sync is in town.

10:47.606 --> 10:49.441
If you can get me a lock
of Justin's hair

10:49.525 --> 10:51.318
I'll never ask you
for shopping money again.

10:51.401 --> 10:53.028
Please!

10:53.111 --> 10:56.156
Eh, we promised Lois
we'd use our powers responsibly.

10:56.240 --> 10:59.117
But I suppose doing the
exact opposite couldn't hurt.

11:04.122 --> 11:05.791
Hey, do you want to split
a Toblerone?

11:05.874 --> 11:06.959
Oh, gosh.

11:07.042 --> 11:09.169
Yeah, I think I do.

11:09.253 --> 11:10.379
Whoo-whoo!

11:10.462 --> 11:11.839
Next stop, my thighs.

11:13.882 --> 11:14.883
All right, Meg,
wait here.

11:14.967 --> 11:15.968
I'll be right back.

11:17.469 --> 11:18.971
( Peter's voice ):
Hi, there. Britney Spears.

11:19.054 --> 11:20.138
You mind if I go in?

11:20.222 --> 11:21.390
Oh, uh, not at all,
Miss Spears.

11:21.473 --> 11:22.474
Oh, call me Peter.

11:22.558 --> 11:24.184
Hey, there, fellas.

11:24.268 --> 11:25.936
Britney?
What are you doing here?

11:26.019 --> 11:27.563
Oh, you know,
I was just in the neighborhood

11:27.646 --> 11:29.565
and, uh-- I'm going
to steal one of your beers--

11:29.648 --> 11:31.859
and, uh, figured I'd stop by
and say hi.

11:31.942 --> 11:33.694
You mind if I have a seat?

11:33.777 --> 11:35.279
( moans happily )

11:35.362 --> 11:36.905
I am out of shape.

11:36.989 --> 11:38.782
Say, uh, Justin,
I got a favor to ask you.

11:38.866 --> 11:39.867
What is it?

11:39.950 --> 11:41.034
I got a hole in my car's muffler

11:41.118 --> 11:42.160
and I need something
to plug it with.

11:42.244 --> 11:43.370
Can I have some of your hair?

11:43.453 --> 11:44.580
Um, I guess so.

11:44.663 --> 11:45.789
Oh, great. Thanks.

11:45.873 --> 11:47.624
All right,
hold still now.

11:48.876 --> 11:49.877
( screams )

11:50.002 --> 11:51.003
Ah, you'll be fine.

11:51.086 --> 11:52.129
Hey, come here,
give me a kiss.

11:54.673 --> 11:57.134
( laughs ):
I'm Gene Shalit now.

11:57.259 --> 11:58.260
Bye.

12:00.470 --> 12:01.513
Here's your martini, ma'am.

12:01.597 --> 12:02.639
Thanks.

12:02.723 --> 12:03.765
Hey, it's gone!

12:03.849 --> 12:04.850
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am.

12:04.933 --> 12:05.934
Here's another one.

12:06.018 --> 12:08.020
What the hell is going on here?

12:10.856 --> 12:12.941
Hi, can I get some pretzels,
or something?

12:13.025 --> 12:14.985
I-I... 'cause, I-I gotta-
I gotta drive.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.695
Whoa, hey, did you
bring enough breasts

12:16.778 --> 12:18.155
for the rest of the class?

12:18.238 --> 12:19.323
( laughing )

12:22.784 --> 12:24.077
Hey, Hector

12:24.161 --> 12:26.038
how long have we
known each other?

12:26.121 --> 12:27.164
Since first grade.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.248
Yeah, yeah.

12:28.332 --> 12:29.833
You remember that time

12:29.917 --> 12:31.668
you called me
Chris Gristle?

12:31.752 --> 12:32.878
I think so.

12:32.961 --> 12:34.254
Well, burn for it!

12:40.344 --> 12:41.845
It's a bird, it's a plane

12:41.929 --> 12:44.014
it's a lower middle-class
Irish family.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.307
That's right, Tom.

12:45.390 --> 12:47.392
This is just one
of many public disturbances

12:47.476 --> 12:49.478
caused by the Griffin
family of Quahog

12:49.561 --> 12:51.647
who seem to have
acquired superpowers.

12:51.730 --> 12:53.190
Very strange story,
Diane.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.192
Coming up next,
can bees think?

12:55.275 --> 12:57.945
A new study confirms
that no, they cannot.

13:00.072 --> 13:01.657
Citizens of Quahog

13:01.740 --> 13:02.741
we have a problem.

13:02.824 --> 13:03.867
You're damn right we do.

13:03.951 --> 13:05.035
Peter Griffin stole my hair.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.119
Settle down, Jeffrey.

13:06.245 --> 13:07.246
Justin.

13:07.329 --> 13:08.330
Mike.

13:08.413 --> 13:09.748
Clearly, the Griffin family
is out of control.

13:09.831 --> 13:10.874
But not to fear.

13:10.958 --> 13:12.543
I've tangled
with superbeings before

13:12.626 --> 13:14.127
and they can be stopped!

13:14.211 --> 13:16.630
You can't stop us, Mayor West!

13:17.422 --> 13:19.550
We are all-powerful!

13:19.633 --> 13:22.427
Clearly, you've let yourselves
become drunk with power.

13:22.511 --> 13:23.637
Silence!

13:24.555 --> 13:26.265
We demand obedience!

13:26.348 --> 13:27.724
Or else!

13:27.808 --> 13:29.142
Is that all
you can do?

13:29.226 --> 13:30.936
Ow! That kind of hurt.

13:31.019 --> 13:32.145
Oh, is that bleeding?

13:32.229 --> 13:33.313
No, no, I guess
it's all right.

13:33.397 --> 13:34.606
Ouch, though.

13:34.690 --> 13:37.609
Anyone who opposes our demands
will be destroyed.

13:37.776 --> 13:39.194
Our first demand:

13:39.278 --> 13:41.113
You will erect a statue
in the town square.

13:41.196 --> 13:42.698
This statue will depict

13:42.781 --> 13:44.908
Blair Warner admitting
to Mrs. Garrett that the poem

13:44.992 --> 13:47.160
she submitted
for her creative writing class

13:47.244 --> 13:50.205
was actually plagiarized
from a work by Emily Dickinson.

13:50.289 --> 13:51.582
We have spoken!

13:51.874 --> 13:53.041
( groans )

13:55.294 --> 13:56.295
That's it!

13:56.378 --> 13:57.921
We have to fight fire with fire.

13:58.005 --> 14:00.549
If nuclear refuse
gave them superpowers

14:00.632 --> 14:02.342
it can do the same for me.

14:02.426 --> 14:05.554
Citizens, I'm off
to the toxic waste dump.

14:05.637 --> 14:07.014
( thunderous applause )

14:13.645 --> 14:15.022
Mayor West,
you have lymphoma.

14:15.105 --> 14:16.356
Oh, my.

14:16.440 --> 14:18.483
Probably from
rolling around in that toxic waste.

14:18.567 --> 14:20.068
I see.

14:20.152 --> 14:21.737
What in God's
name were you trying to prove?

14:22.029 --> 14:23.906
I was trying
to gain superpowers.

14:23.989 --> 14:25.324
Well, that's
just silly.

14:25.407 --> 14:26.450
Silly, yes.

14:26.575 --> 14:27.910
Idiotic, yes.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.041
No, no, that's not what

14:34.124 --> 14:35.834
Mrs. Garrett's
bosom looked like.

14:35.918 --> 14:38.045
It looked more like this...

14:38.128 --> 14:40.380
Notice the sun spots
at the top of the right can.

14:40.464 --> 14:41.882
Excuse

14:41.965 --> 14:43.717
I have a
message from the Quahog Hospital.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.888
Well, I just
feel awful about this, Mayor West.

14:47.971 --> 14:49.014
Yeah, me, too.

14:49.097 --> 14:50.390
Stewie,
fluff his pillows.

14:51.808 --> 14:53.227
I'll heat up his soup.

14:54.895 --> 14:57.397
I'll go to China to see
if there's a cure. Nope.

14:57.481 --> 14:58.649
Now, now, the doctor says

14:58.732 --> 15:00.192
I'm going to make
a full recovery.

15:00.275 --> 15:02.611
The important thing
is you learned your lesson.

15:02.694 --> 15:04.363
I can't believe we let
those superpowers

15:04.446 --> 15:06.198
go to our heads.

15:06.281 --> 15:08.158
I feel like
such a bastard.

15:08.242 --> 15:09.326
Me, too.

15:09.451 --> 15:10.953
Well, for now, we are
going to use our powers

15:11.036 --> 15:12.412
to help you get better.

15:12.496 --> 15:13.497
Thank you.

15:13.580 --> 15:14.998
But as long as I have

15:15.082 --> 15:17.125
Mrs. Garrett's giant rack
by my bedside

15:17.209 --> 15:18.252
I'll be all right.

15:18.335 --> 15:20.879
Girls! Girls! Girls!

15:20.963 --> 15:23.257
( laughing )

15:36.395 --> 15:37.729
Hear ye, hear ye!

15:37.813 --> 15:39.523
I call to order
the first meeting

15:39.606 --> 15:41.066
of the "We Hate Broads Club."

15:41.233 --> 15:42.526
ALL:
Yeah!

15:42.609 --> 15:44.111
'Cause all you
need in life

15:44.194 --> 15:45.279
is your best pals.

15:45.362 --> 15:47.030
Sure, as long as
those pals ain't dames.

15:47.114 --> 15:48.699
O-tay!

15:49.491 --> 15:50.492
( creaking )
What was that?

15:51.702 --> 15:53.078
Hey! I thought
we told you guys

15:53.161 --> 15:54.496
to quit snooping
around here.

15:54.580 --> 15:55.956
But we need
to find a story

15:56.039 --> 15:57.875
if I'm ever going
to be a big-time reporter man.

15:57.958 --> 15:58.959
All right, all right.

15:59.084 --> 16:01.378
Make like Siamese twins
and split.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.630
And-And then one of you die.

16:03.714 --> 16:05.007
When do we have
the grape juice?

16:05.132 --> 16:06.466
I came
for the grape juice.

16:10.095 --> 16:11.805
Hey, Quagmire, watch this.

16:13.432 --> 16:14.433
Hey, kick me!

16:14.516 --> 16:15.559
( yells )

16:17.269 --> 16:18.979
Boys and girls,
we have a new student

16:19.062 --> 16:20.272
joining us this morning.

16:20.564 --> 16:22.024
Her name is Lois Pewterschmidt.

16:22.107 --> 16:24.359
Ugh, just what we need--
another girl.

16:24.443 --> 16:25.485
You said it!

16:27.154 --> 16:29.489
Wow! I'd like
to play doctor with her

16:29.573 --> 16:32.117
and-and remove
her inflamed appendix

16:32.201 --> 16:34.244
before it bursts,
causing sepsis.

16:34.328 --> 16:37.372
Giggedy, giggedy, giggedy!

16:38.707 --> 16:40.125
Lois, what you reading?

16:40.209 --> 16:41.418
The Red Badge
of Courage.

16:41.710 --> 16:42.836
( sighs )

16:42.920 --> 16:44.379
I sure wish I could meet
a brave fella

16:44.463 --> 16:45.631
like the guy in this book.

16:46.006 --> 16:48.091
You know, uh,
I'm a brave guy, Lois.

16:48.175 --> 16:49.176
Oh, yeah?!

16:49.259 --> 16:50.552
I bet you're not brave enough
to laugh at death.

16:50.636 --> 16:51.637
Watch me!

16:51.803 --> 16:52.846
( laughing)

16:52.930 --> 16:53.931
Oh, thanks.

16:54.014 --> 16:56.016
Like I don't have
enough trouble fitting in.

16:56.099 --> 16:58.519
I bet you're not brave enough
to take all your clothes off.

16:58.602 --> 16:59.686
Way ahead of you. Ow!

17:00.062 --> 17:01.855
Well, I bet
you're too chicken

17:01.939 --> 17:04.149
to spend the night
at the old Selberg place.

17:05.317 --> 17:06.443
PETER:
Uh, Cleveland

17:06.527 --> 17:07.611
you mind stepping
out of the way?

17:07.736 --> 17:08.862
Oh, sorry.

17:11.490 --> 17:13.283
Well, I ain't
chicken to spend the night there!

17:13.367 --> 17:14.701
Well, I ain't neither

17:14.993 --> 17:16.912
and to prove it,
I'm going up there tonight!

17:17.037 --> 17:18.580
See you there,
pal!

17:18.664 --> 17:20.165
You can't stay
in that house.

17:20.249 --> 17:22.626
Old Man Selberg's
ghost still haunts it.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.420
Not to mention the myriad
of bacteria and allergens

17:25.504 --> 17:27.464
from years
of substandard housekeeping.

17:27.756 --> 17:29.466
It does not augur well for you.

17:29.550 --> 17:31.051
Ah, zip it, egghead--

17:31.134 --> 17:33.595
you with your big words
and your...

17:33.679 --> 17:36.139
and your-your small,
difficult words.

17:36.223 --> 17:39.434
Wow. Any boy who would spend
the night in that creepy place

17:39.518 --> 17:41.770
sure would be the bravest fella
I ever met.

17:42.771 --> 17:44.982
That Lois is
some kind of woman.

17:45.065 --> 17:48.694
Yeah. Just thinking about her
makes my testicles want to drop.

17:48.777 --> 17:50.237
Oop, speak of the devil.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.446
Oop, make that devils.

17:58.871 --> 18:01.874
All right, Quagmire's team will
take the left side of the house

18:01.957 --> 18:03.792
and Peter's team
will take the right.

18:03.876 --> 18:05.419
And whoever's alive
in the morning

18:05.502 --> 18:06.795
can bury his dead pals.

18:06.879 --> 18:08.964
Do I have a cobweb
in my hair?

18:09.131 --> 18:11.967
It feels like I have
a cobweb in my hair.

18:14.261 --> 18:16.096
( animal howl )

18:16.763 --> 18:18.223
What was that?

18:18.307 --> 18:20.851
Ah. It's just
Michael Winslow from Police Academy.

18:20.934 --> 18:23.478
( fierce animal noises )

18:23.562 --> 18:25.689
( helicopter whirring )

18:25.772 --> 18:29.610
( imitating elephant,
sheep, submarine )

18:29.776 --> 18:31.278
( all scream )

18:32.654 --> 18:34.114
This house gives me
the creeps.

18:34.448 --> 18:36.033
Yeah, let's get out of here.

18:36.116 --> 18:37.159
Wait, wait, wait.

18:37.242 --> 18:38.243
We can't let
those guys win.

18:38.327 --> 18:39.536
What we ought to do

18:39.620 --> 18:41.288
is pretend
we're ghosts, see...

18:41.371 --> 18:43.415
And then we'll scare the
other guys out of the house...

18:43.498 --> 18:44.791
-...then we can say we spent...
-The...

18:44.875 --> 18:46.376
...night, and everyone'll think
that we're...

18:46.460 --> 18:47.669
-...The...
-...bravest kids in the world.

18:47.753 --> 18:48.754
Especially Lois.

18:48.837 --> 18:49.838
( laughing)

18:49.922 --> 18:50.923
All right!

18:51.006 --> 18:53.383
( laughing)

18:55.010 --> 18:56.011
( short laugh )

18:58.388 --> 18:59.806
Hey, I got a great idea!

19:00.349 --> 19:02.518
This will really scare 'em.
Everybody set?

19:02.601 --> 19:03.644
Check.

19:03.852 --> 19:04.853
Check.

19:04.937 --> 19:06.396
( giggling ): Sock it to me!

19:07.940 --> 19:10.484
-Oh, Oh! Oh, whoa!
-Whoa!

19:11.235 --> 19:12.402
ADAM WEST:
If we only had a teacup

19:12.486 --> 19:14.988
this would be like playing
find-the-teacup-in-the-bedsheet

19:15.072 --> 19:16.615
like I do with my Aunt Sophia.

19:27.501 --> 19:29.419
( all scream )

19:31.255 --> 19:33.507
My God!
Not only are ghosts real

19:33.632 --> 19:35.467
but their innards are made of children!

19:35.551 --> 19:36.802
Peter, it's us.

19:36.885 --> 19:38.804
( ghostly howl )

19:40.597 --> 19:42.140
Say, that's
a nice effect.

19:42.224 --> 19:43.642
Yeah.
That's really scary.

19:43.725 --> 19:44.768
Wait a second.

19:44.852 --> 19:46.687
If you're there.
and I'm here

19:46.770 --> 19:49.648
and Istanbul is
somewhere in this general area

19:49.731 --> 19:50.816
then who the hell is that?

19:51.233 --> 19:53.527
( all screaming )

19:58.115 --> 19:59.700
Ha! Get used
to this sight, Diane:

19:59.783 --> 20:01.118
guys running away from you.

20:01.201 --> 20:02.661
Tom, you're so deep
in the closet

20:02.744 --> 20:04.288
you're finding
Christmas presents.

20:07.833 --> 20:09.543
All right, now
remember our story.

20:09.626 --> 20:11.461
We tell Lois that we
both stayed all night

20:11.545 --> 20:12.921
and I caught the
ghost with my lasso.

20:13.005 --> 20:14.006
Yeah, yeah

20:14.089 --> 20:15.215
and I punched him so hard

20:15.299 --> 20:16.884
he ran crying
all the way back to Hell!

20:16.967 --> 20:18.427
She'll have to believe that.

20:18.510 --> 20:19.970
It hangs together so perfectly.

20:20.053 --> 20:21.471
DIANE:
Our top story today:

20:21.555 --> 20:23.056
Cowardly Kids
Lay Down Rubber

20:23.140 --> 20:24.474
at the Old Selberg Place.

20:24.558 --> 20:25.684
Wait, wait,
turn that up.

20:25.767 --> 20:27.186
Peter Griffin and Glen Quagmire

20:27.269 --> 20:28.604
were seen bolting...

20:28.687 --> 20:29.688
( louder ):
were seen bolting

20:29.771 --> 20:31.523
out of the supposedly
haunted house

20:31.607 --> 20:34.318
after just one half-hour,
leaving only their pride

20:34.401 --> 20:36.236
and twin trails of
urine behind them.

20:36.320 --> 20:37.821
Ah, cheese and crackers!

20:37.905 --> 20:39.573
Now Lois will know everything!

20:39.656 --> 20:41.158
Not if I can help it.

20:41.241 --> 20:42.868
( imitating phone ringing )

20:43.035 --> 20:44.036
Newsroom.

20:44.119 --> 20:45.412
Hello, this is Peter Griffin.

20:45.495 --> 20:46.997
You better stop saying
that stuff

20:47.080 --> 20:48.290
or we're going to watch
something else.

20:48.373 --> 20:49.875
Today on The View...

20:49.958 --> 20:51.793
( with lisp ):
"Cooties: the silent killer."

20:54.755 --> 20:55.964
Uh, Lois?

20:56.048 --> 20:57.841
There's something
we got to tell you.

20:57.925 --> 20:59.051
Yeah.

20:59.134 --> 21:00.427
We didn't stay in
the haunted house.

21:00.511 --> 21:01.845
We're not brave.

21:01.970 --> 21:04.681
Oh, I decided
I don't care about bravery.

21:04.765 --> 21:05.766
-You don't?!
-You don't?!

21:05.849 --> 21:09.186
No. I realized
what I really like is smarts.

21:10.270 --> 21:11.730
Sorry I'm late, darling.

21:11.813 --> 21:13.941
I was checking my
stool for blood.

21:14.024 --> 21:15.275
-Mort Goldman?!
-Mort Goldman?!

21:15.359 --> 21:16.485
He's so clever.

21:16.568 --> 21:17.569
Show 'em, Morty.

21:20.405 --> 21:21.907
( ghostly howling )

21:21.990 --> 21:24.076
( both scream )

21:25.536 --> 21:27.454
( screaming continues )

21:27.913 --> 21:29.248
He got us again.

21:29.331 --> 21:30.999
Yeah, this whole thing
just shows

21:31.083 --> 21:32.417
that women are
nothing but trouble.

21:32.501 --> 21:33.627
You said it!

21:33.710 --> 21:35.754
Let's you and me
swear off 'em for good!

21:35.838 --> 21:37.256
And how!

21:40.300 --> 21:41.844
I say, Quagmire,
it seems to me

21:41.927 --> 21:44.221
we've each made
another $500 million.

21:44.304 --> 21:45.472
Good thing
we swore off women

21:45.556 --> 21:46.932
so we wouldn't
be distracted

21:47.015 --> 21:49.059
and unable to accumulate
this vast amount of wealth.

21:49.142 --> 21:50.519
Yes. Hey, you watch the ticker.

21:50.602 --> 21:51.854
I'm going to go
microwave a bagel

21:51.937 --> 21:52.938
and have sex with it.

21:53.021 --> 21:54.022
Butter's in the fridge.
