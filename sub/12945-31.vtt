[SCHOOL BELL RINGING]

00:02.834 --> 00:05.967
Oh, hey, Lizzie, thanks for getting
my back in Spanish yesterday.

00:06.033 --> 00:09.033
I had no idea that <i>"¿Cómo te llamas?"</i>
meant "What's your name?"

00:09.100 --> 00:11.033
I really thought
there was a llama at school.

00:11.100 --> 00:14.100
Oh, sure. No problemo.

00:14.367 --> 00:16.867
The only thing better
than talking to Ethan Craft,

00:16.934 --> 00:19.000
is talking to him in two languages.

00:19.166 --> 00:22.600
So, <i>cómo estás?</i>
Or as I'd like to say, what's up, yo?

00:23.633 --> 00:26.033
Actually, maybe it's best
if he didn't speak at all.

00:26.467 --> 00:27.934
You guys are never gonna guess

00:28.000 --> 00:29.467
what came in the mail
for me the other day.

00:29.533 --> 00:32.600
A new skateboard, food, CDs,
a cell phone, money?

00:32.667 --> 00:36.000
Mmm, kind of. A credit card.

00:36.066 --> 00:37.166
A credit card?

00:37.266 --> 00:39.100
What do you need a credit card for?

00:39.166 --> 00:41.967
I don't, but this one came in the mail
for me with my name on it,

00:42.033 --> 00:44.900
and I'm pre-approved
with a $5,000 line of credit.

00:45.900 --> 00:47.400
That makes you, like, a millionaire.

00:47.734 --> 00:49.934
Not to mention, in with the ladies.

00:50.033 --> 00:52.000
Why? It's not like I'm gonna keep it.

00:52.066 --> 00:53.133
Dude, you have to keep it.

00:54.166 --> 00:57.333
I would rather impress the ladies
with what's in my mind

00:57.400 --> 00:58.767
than what's in my wallet.

00:59.233 --> 01:00.333
That's deep.

01:01.233 --> 01:04.300
Besides, what could I possibly use
a credit card for, anyway?

01:04.367 --> 01:05.567
Well, for emergencies.

01:05.867 --> 01:07.700
Like when you're out of cash
at the mall,

01:07.767 --> 01:09.367
and the skirt you want is on sale.

01:09.834 --> 01:11.667
And think about
your independence, Gordo.

01:11.734 --> 01:14.266
You would never have to ask
your parents for anything ever again.

01:14.333 --> 01:16.500
But I like asking
my parents for things.

01:16.567 --> 01:18.300
It's really the only time
I ever talk to them.

01:18.433 --> 01:22.166
I don't know much, but I do know
if I had something that valuable,

01:22.233 --> 01:23.633
I wouldn't be so quick to give it up.

01:23.967 --> 01:26.300
Hmm. Maybe you guys
are onto something.

01:26.367 --> 01:28.367
I mean, I am responsible.

01:28.433 --> 01:29.900
It's not like
I'll abuse the privilege.

01:29.967 --> 01:32.300
Exactly. It's you
we're talking about, Gordo.

01:32.400 --> 01:35.633
The credit card will probably just sit
in your wallet, collecting dust.

01:36.500 --> 01:38.033
Fine, I'll keep it.

01:38.333 --> 01:40.033
What could possibly go wrong?

01:40.734 --> 01:43.800
Yeah, like I never heard
that one before.

[THEME SONG PLAYING]

02:47.934 --> 02:51.000
You are so gonna get an A
in your science fair project.

02:51.066 --> 02:54.567
Yep. A cardboard skeleton of myself
is totally original.

02:54.700 --> 02:57.300
Nobody else is going to come close.

02:58.166 --> 03:00.000
Given your project any thought yet?

03:00.066 --> 03:01.533
Nah. I've been kind of busy.

03:01.600 --> 03:04.967
Yeah, right. Doing what?
Watching cartoons?

03:05.033 --> 03:07.834
Relax. I got plenty of time.

03:08.133 --> 03:12.433
I mean, the science fair
isn't even until the end of the month.

03:14.033 --> 03:16.300
The end of the month is next week.

03:16.367 --> 03:17.433
What?

03:21.834 --> 03:25.700
Okay. That'll be $5.

03:26.200 --> 03:27.533
Hey, I got an idea.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.500
I thought that was
only for emergencies.

03:29.567 --> 03:31.333
Let's just see what happens.

03:31.400 --> 03:33.834
Just because some anonymous
credit card company sent it to me,

03:33.934 --> 03:35.934
doesn't mean I can actually use it.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.100
Look at me, I'm still a kid.

03:37.166 --> 03:38.300
There you go.

03:41.800 --> 03:44.767
Uh, sorry, no can do.

03:44.934 --> 03:45.967
Oh, well.

03:46.233 --> 03:48.567
You need to sign the back of it first
before I can run the charge.

03:48.667 --> 03:49.667
Well, do you have a pen?

03:49.834 --> 03:51.834
Actually, um, we'll use cash.

03:52.400 --> 03:53.533
We will?

03:53.600 --> 03:55.166

what would happen, Lizzie.

03:55.834 --> 03:57.000
Oh. [CHUCKLES]

So, as you see, if you melted
all the ice in the world,

partially responsible for this.

is a reflection of our parenting.

the same thing.

-Yeah. I'll make some popcorn.
-Okay.

with the bubblegum pink nail polish,

if I go with the plaid top.

he was trying to cross the road,

11:57.467 --> 12:01.834

so it had to cross the road...

12:03.166 --> 12:05.467

chasing a chicken

that knocks over the dominoes,

12:26.900 --> 12:29.400

started on the wheel,

spell it out for him.
