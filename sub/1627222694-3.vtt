00:24.315 --> 00:25.859
That's not gold.

00:27.861 --> 00:28.903
[Kie grunts]

00:28.987 --> 00:30.280
Holy shit.

00:32.240 --> 00:33.283
This is from my dad.

00:33.366 --> 00:34.200
[lighter clicks]

00:34.284 --> 00:35.994
[vehicle approaching]

00:37.370 --> 00:39.873
Code red. Code red.
Square groupers! Square groupers!

00:39.956 --> 00:42.417
-[Kie] Go.
-[JJ] It's the guys who robbed your house.

00:44.461 --> 00:46.087
-Light!
-[Pope] Light.

00:46.546 --> 00:48.256
-Turn your light off, man!
-[Kie] John B?

00:48.339 --> 00:49.382
Your light!

00:50.633 --> 00:51.843
[man] I see something!

00:52.635 --> 00:53.803
[Kie] Do you think it's them?

00:54.721 --> 00:55.889
[JJ] Homie's got a gun.

00:56.347 --> 00:57.682
-Screw this.
-[men shouting]

00:58.308 --> 00:59.976
[man] Right here!

01:04.522 --> 01:05.857
[grunting]

01:05.940 --> 01:06.983
[JJ] Hurry up!

01:07.067 --> 01:08.693
-[Kie] Go!
-[men yelling]

01:08.777 --> 01:09.903
-Guys! Guys!
-[Kie] Shit.

01:09.986 --> 01:11.863
-[Pope] Guys, I'm stuck.
-[JJ] Pope, come on!

01:11.946 --> 01:13.782
-[John B] All right, guys...
-[Kie] I got you.

01:13.865 --> 01:16.034
-No. Pope, don't move, okay?
-[Pope] You're gonna rip me.

01:16.117 --> 01:18.369
-Wait. You're gonna rip me!
-[Kie] You're fine. Come on!

01:18.453 --> 01:19.746
[John B] Pope, come on!

01:19.829 --> 01:20.997
Nice! Come on, dude.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.833
-It's a little Tootsie Roll.
-[Kie laughing] Come on!

01:24.375 --> 01:26.836
-Get in!
-Stupid!

01:28.755 --> 01:30.173
-Come on.
-[JJ] Come on.

01:32.967 --> 01:34.344
[tires screeching]

01:40.558 --> 01:41.768
[sighs]

01:41.851 --> 01:43.853
Kids are gettin' weirder every year.

01:45.980 --> 01:49.150
-That bread had mold on it three days ago.
-I'll just pull off the bad parts.

01:49.234 --> 01:52.946
Plus, mold is good for you.
It's just a natural organism.

01:53.029 --> 01:54.447
-[Kie] JJ!
-Yup, yup, yup!

01:54.531 --> 01:55.740
Hot damn! Let's do it.

01:58.743 --> 02:00.286
Mmm... [gags]

02:10.964 --> 02:11.923
[John B] Holy shit.

02:13.299 --> 02:15.260
[Pope] Oh. X marks the spot.

02:18.054 --> 02:20.056
[John B] Longitude, latitude.

02:20.557 --> 02:22.183
Wait, there's somethin' else in there.

02:28.773 --> 02:29.607
What's that?

02:29.691 --> 02:31.359
It's a tape recorder, dumbass.

02:32.944 --> 02:35.113
-[father on tape] <i>Dear Bird.</i>
-Who's Bird?

02:35.405 --> 02:36.823
That's what my dad called me.

02:36.906 --> 02:40.118
[father] <i>I hate to say, "I told you so,"</i>
<i>but I told you so.</i>

02:40.535 --> 02:41.995
<i>And you doubted your old man.</i>

02:44.038 --> 02:45.748
I suspect at this moment,

02:45.832 --> 02:49.836
you're filled with guilt and self-loathing
over our last fight,

02:49.919 --> 02:52.714
but don't kill yourself just yet, kid.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.341
I didn't expect
to find the Merchant either.

02:55.758 --> 02:57.093
[clattering sounds on tape]

03:00.138 --> 03:01.973
[father]
You were probably right to call me out.

03:02.056 --> 03:03.808
Wasn't exactly Father of the Decade.

03:03.892 --> 03:07.353
[sighs] What can I say, kid?
I could smell the barn.

03:08.980 --> 03:09.981
[sighs]

03:10.398 --> 03:12.483
And hopefully, we're listenin' to this

03:12.567 --> 03:14.652
in our brand new sugar-shack
down in Costa Rica,

03:14.736 --> 03:17.655
livin' off passive investments
and pulling on permits.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.115
[sighs]

03:19.199 --> 03:22.702
If not, and you find this
for less than optimal reasons,

03:22.785 --> 03:25.663
well, that's what the map is for.

03:25.747 --> 03:28.374
There she is, the wreck of the<i> </i>Merchant.

03:29.083 --> 03:32.170
<i>If somethin' happens to me,</i>
<i>finish what I started.</i>

03:32.754 --> 03:34.214
<i>Go for the gold, kid.</i>

03:35.381 --> 03:38.218
<i>I love you, Bird,</i>
<i>even if I didn't always act like it.</i>

03:40.345 --> 03:42.013
[vehicle approaching]

03:44.891 --> 03:46.476
I'll see you on the other side.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.064
[static crackles on tape]

03:54.692 --> 03:56.152
[tape recorder clicks off]

03:58.071 --> 03:59.280
[John B sighs]

03:59.364 --> 04:02.575
-[sobbing]
-[JJ] Holy shit, he did it!

04:02.659 --> 04:05.328
-Big John-- He found the Merchant--
-Can you... can you please?

04:05.411 --> 04:06.788
-[JJ] Sorry.
-[John B sobbing]

04:10.458 --> 04:11.918
[acoustic guitar playing]

04:13.086 --> 04:14.796
[distant thunder rumbling]

04:21.219 --> 04:22.428
How much was it again?

04:23.596 --> 04:24.639
[John B] Four hundred mil.

04:24.722 --> 04:26.599
[loon calling]

04:27.350 --> 04:29.852
[JJ sighs]
All right, let's talk the split.

04:30.687 --> 04:34.607
Now, before we say "evenly,"
may I remind you that I am the only one

04:34.691 --> 04:37.360
that can properly defend us
from those groupers who were after us.

04:37.443 --> 04:39.737
-Protection? Not cheap, okay?
-[Pope] You haven't trained.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.614
-You've done zero training.
-[JJ] YouTube, bro!

04:41.698 --> 04:43.533
That's at least
a five percent bump right there.

04:43.616 --> 04:46.327
-[Pope] You haven't--
-Any objections? Didn't think so.

04:46.828 --> 04:49.163
-[Pope] Yeah.
-[JJ] I don't hear any, so…

04:49.247 --> 04:51.374
What are you gonna do
with your 100 mil, Pope?

04:54.210 --> 04:55.670
Pay for college in advance.

04:56.754 --> 04:59.215
And also, textbooks. Those are expensive.

05:00.675 --> 05:01.676
What about you, Kie?

05:01.759 --> 05:04.095
Yeah, what does a socialist do
when she's rich?

05:04.178 --> 05:05.513
[chuckles]

05:06.764 --> 05:08.891
Just wanna make a double album.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.019
-About OBX, the Pogues.
-[Pope chuckles]

05:11.602 --> 05:14.022
You know, the way <i>Catch a Fire</i>
is about Kingston.

05:14.397 --> 05:17.191
Record it at Marley Studio,
Peter Tosh producing.

05:17.275 --> 05:19.527
-Peter Tosh is dead.
-[Kie] Peter Tosh is dead. I know.

05:19.610 --> 05:21.779
Spirit of Peter Tosh will never die.

05:21.863 --> 05:22.989
[JJ] I know what I'll do.

05:23.072 --> 05:25.825
I'm gonna get a big ass house
on Figure Eight and go full Kook.

05:25.908 --> 05:27.702
-You're gonna go full Kook?
-[JJ] Yup.

05:27.785 --> 05:30.788
Gonna get a marble statue of myself,
and then I'm gonna get a koi pond.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.957
-Put a bunch of those fish--
-[Kie] I'm never visiting.

05:33.041 --> 05:34.125
What are you gonna do, JB?

05:41.424 --> 05:42.633
To going full Kook.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.428
[all] To going full Kook!

05:45.511 --> 05:46.929
[Kie laughing]

05:58.566 --> 05:59.609
[JJ whistles]

06:01.235 --> 06:02.403
You guys see that?

06:02.487 --> 06:06.032
That's the Malibu 24-MXZ,
the world's finest wakesetter.

06:06.532 --> 06:08.993
Number one in luxury,
quality, and performance.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.704
200K, easy.

06:11.788 --> 06:14.457
-We picked the wrong parents.
-I hate to break it to you guys,

06:14.540 --> 06:16.167
but that's Topper and his girlfriend.

06:24.801 --> 06:27.136
You don't have to act like
you don't see us, bitch.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.524
[Sarah] You should've heard
how John B talked to me.

06:39.941 --> 06:41.692
That kid's got a mouth on him!

06:42.110 --> 06:44.946
-Well, he showed his true colors, Sarah.
-He was so rude!

06:45.029 --> 06:47.281
I know!
It's what I've been trying to tell you.

06:47.365 --> 06:49.575
I mean, he's lucky your dad
didn't press charges.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.953
I know! After stealing scuba from us?

06:52.453 --> 06:54.705
It's just... kind of ridiculous to me.

06:54.789 --> 06:56.749
-After everything my dad has done for him.
-Yeah.

06:56.833 --> 06:57.708
Just so generous.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.460
-You'd think he'd be more grateful.
-I know.

06:59.544 --> 07:02.130
-Then he yells at me like it's my fault!
-[chuckles] That's--

07:02.213 --> 07:04.382
It's-- He's a Pogue,
at the end of the day.

07:04.465 --> 07:07.510
I mean, you can say
we're all just people, or-- or whatever,

07:07.593 --> 07:10.346
but it's a totally different mindset
on the cut.

07:10.930 --> 07:12.557
Yo. You look thirsty!

07:12.640 --> 07:15.977
-Okay, what do we-- what do we got here?
-Have some of that, baby.

07:17.186 --> 07:19.439
-[sniffs] Oh, my God!
-[boy laughing]

07:21.524 --> 07:22.400
-Mm!
-[boy] Yeah!

07:22.483 --> 07:25.236
That's how we do it, baby!
-Oh, man. Come on, Sarah.

07:25.319 --> 07:26.904
-[boy] Come on, Sarah.
-[Topper] Let's go.

07:26.988 --> 07:29.907
-What did you do to this?
-[Topper] He's not playin' around.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.702
-[boy] Yeah!
-Mm!

07:32.785 --> 07:35.121
-[Topper] Whoa! Whoa, whoa!
-[Sarah] Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

07:35.830 --> 07:37.540
Since when did you start drinking?

07:37.623 --> 07:38.499
Since today!

07:38.583 --> 07:39.667
[boy] Wow.

07:39.750 --> 07:40.835
Great going, Kelce.

07:40.918 --> 07:42.587
You guys got it under control?

07:42.670 --> 07:44.338
Yes, sir! It's looking good, sir!

07:44.422 --> 07:46.632
-Just clearing the stretch out!
-[Sarah] Just hydrating!

07:46.716 --> 07:48.968
-Almost finished!
-Great job. Keep it up!

07:49.051 --> 07:50.511
-[Kelce] Yeah.
- Thank you! Thank you.

07:51.888 --> 07:55.308
Just a moment, friends,
to acknowledge our blessings.

07:59.187 --> 08:00.480
To the big Kahuna...

08:00.563 --> 08:01.689
-[snorts]
-Sh.

08:01.772 --> 08:04.484
Thank you for the opportunity
for us to come out here

08:04.567 --> 08:07.695
and restore Masonborough
to its virgin glory.

08:07.778 --> 08:09.071
-[both laughing]
-[man] Amen.

08:10.907 --> 08:12.158
-[boy] Yeah!
-[girl] Yay!

08:13.409 --> 08:15.495
-[laughing]
-He doesn't like us, that guy.

08:15.661 --> 08:18.664
-[Sarah] Yeah.
<i>-♪ You've got the heat for someone ♪</i>

08:18.748 --> 08:19.707
-[Sarah] Drink it.
-Stop!

08:19.790 --> 08:22.460
<i>♪ Someone caught you eye... ♪</i>

08:22.960 --> 08:24.795
[JJ] All right, keep a look out.

08:24.879 --> 08:26.547
We're behind enemy lines.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.132
Yo, come on, man. Just put it back.

08:28.216 --> 08:29.091
-What?
-JJ.

08:29.175 --> 08:30.635
You can never be too careful.

08:30.718 --> 08:34.722
Hey, I predict that bringing a weapon
to a four-star hotel

08:34.805 --> 08:36.849
will likely cause more problems
than they solve.

08:36.933 --> 08:37.850
Thank you, Pope.

08:37.934 --> 08:40.353
I swear to God, I'm gonna throw that thing
in the ocean, JJ.

08:40.436 --> 08:41.395
Put it back.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.024
-[Pope] There you go.
-You can't grab a gun like that.

08:45.107 --> 08:46.400
Can't forget my badge.

08:48.986 --> 08:50.404
Professional busboy.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.156
So, where are we going now?

08:52.240 --> 08:55.368
We're getting on the internet because only
rich people have electricity right now.

08:55.451 --> 08:56.369
This way!

08:56.452 --> 08:57.411
Andrew!

08:57.495 --> 08:58.621
[Andrew] All right?

08:58.704 --> 08:59.539
What's up, bro?

09:01.457 --> 09:03.125
-Mama L, good to see you!
-Hey, no!

09:03.209 --> 09:04.168
-JJ!
-Mm-hm.

09:04.252 --> 09:07.463
See, they got the backup generators going?
Kooks don't miss a beat.

09:12.093 --> 09:14.011
-Sweet Lord, the internet!
-[Kie] John B.

09:14.470 --> 09:16.138
-I've missed you.
-[JJ] Let me get in there.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.683
-Gotta check out my Insta models.
-[Kie] We don't have time.

09:18.766 --> 09:20.685
-Go. Nah.
-Hey. Hey! Hey!

09:20.768 --> 09:22.770
-I got the map!
-[Pope] Coordinates, please?

09:22.853 --> 09:27.984
34° 57' 30" north. 75° 55' 42" west.

09:31.445 --> 09:34.240
-Boom, continental shelf right there.
-Well, if it's off the deep end,

09:34.323 --> 09:36.367
it's not gonna be much
of a treasure hunt, is it?

09:36.492 --> 09:37.451
[sighs]

09:37.535 --> 09:38.661
[Pope] Come on, baby.

09:39.287 --> 09:40.121
Come on.

09:40.496 --> 09:42.331
[voices outside]

09:42.415 --> 09:44.417
[footsteps and laughter]

09:48.129 --> 09:50.840
Shit, it's on the high side.
It's only 900 feet.

09:50.923 --> 09:51.924
[JJ] That's not too deep.

09:52.633 --> 09:55.052
-Is that doable or something?
-Yeah, totally doable.

09:55.136 --> 09:56.887
Will we be taking your personal submarine?

09:56.971 --> 09:58.556
How do you know this, Mr. Dive Master?

09:58.639 --> 09:59.682
The salvage yard.

09:59.765 --> 10:02.977
They got a drone that can drop 1,000.
It has a 360 camera and everything.

10:03.060 --> 10:05.521
It's for, like, deep dives and stuff.
It's exactly what we need.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.440
Can your dad get
his grimy little hands on that?

10:07.523 --> 10:10.026
Well, my dad's grimy little hands
got his ass fired.

10:10.109 --> 10:13.613
I guess the salvage captain frowns
on showing up shitfaced, turns out.

10:14.322 --> 10:17.283
But the drone's there.
It's in the impound yard out back.

10:17.366 --> 10:19.619
How much did you say
was on the Royal Merchant again?

10:20.286 --> 10:21.370
-400 million.
-[JJ] 400 mil.

10:22.747 --> 10:25.166
-400 million dollars?
-Yep.

10:25.249 --> 10:27.710
-No. Absolutely not. Absolutely not. No!
-[Kie] Pope! Move.

10:27.793 --> 10:29.503
-Guys, that's too--
-[Kie] Come on.

10:30.129 --> 10:32.548
-Can't we do anything legal for money?
-[John B] Go.

10:32.632 --> 10:35.676
-[retches, coughs]
-[Sarah] Ugh... Oh, God.

10:36.260 --> 10:39.388
-[groans]
-Okay. [sighs]

10:39.472 --> 10:41.682
-Ugh.
-So, what have we learned?

10:41.766 --> 10:45.394
[sighs] Never mix vodka
with Crystal Light.

10:46.228 --> 10:47.730
-Very good.

10:57.657 --> 10:58.491
What's that?

10:58.574 --> 11:00.826
You cover for me sneaking out

Please.

Fine.

-What do you want me to say?

11:17.843 --> 11:20.262
[Ward] I don't want you to say anything!
Take care of business.

11:20.346 --> 11:21.847
-Where are the generators?
-Okay!

11:21.931 --> 11:23.557
[Ward] I gave you money

You said you would take care of it.
Did you take care of it? Where are they?

I tell you what.
You know that Pogue I just fired?

11:35.778 --> 11:37.613
Way more reliable than you.

11:38.030 --> 11:39.448
-[Rafe] Really?
-[Ward] Yeah, really!

11:39.532 --> 11:40.991
You need to get it together, Rafe,

11:41.075 --> 11:42.910
-or you can go live on the cut.

11:42.993 --> 11:44.578
-[Ward] That funny to you?
-Wow.

11:44.662 --> 11:46.914
[Ward] You can go live on the damn cut,
Rafe...

11:47.248 --> 11:48.749
as far as I'm concerned.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.419
Now get out of here.
I'm sick of lookin' at you.

11:52.128 --> 11:54.213
Make yourself useful somewhere, somehow.

11:54.630 --> 11:55.798
Sarah's not working.

11:55.881 --> 11:58.634
[Ward] This isn't about Sarah, Rafe.
You're almost 20.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.929
You don't just get to sit back
and have everything handed to you.

12:02.012 --> 12:04.223
-Yes, sir.
-[Ward] It doesn't seem you understand me.

12:04.306 --> 12:05.933
I'll take care of those generators, okay?

12:06.016 --> 12:07.560
I'll believe that when I see it.

12:10.771 --> 12:11.647
Told you.

12:12.481 --> 12:15.234
Shouldn't have bought that motorcycle
with the generator money.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.069
Hm.

[Rafe] Hey, Barry.

-What's good with you, man?

12:49.810 --> 12:50.978
Not much, man.

12:51.061 --> 12:53.105
-Should've worn a wifebeater.
-[chuckles]

12:53.189 --> 12:54.774
You couldn't beat nobody, Rafe.

12:54.857 --> 12:55.691
Come on.

12:59.069 --> 13:00.070
[Rafe] What's up?

13:01.405 --> 13:03.240

13:18.047 --> 13:19.131
[Barry] And voilà!

13:19.215 --> 13:21.175
-This what we're looking for?
-Yeah, yeah.

13:21.258 --> 13:22.635
[tuts] Um...

13:22.718 --> 13:25.304
-You got that cabbage?
-So I was hoping for a little credit.

13:25.846 --> 13:27.598
-Oh, f...
-[Rafe] Listen, man--

13:27.681 --> 13:29.350
You're hoping in the wrong place.

13:29.433 --> 13:31.393
[Rafe] You do know how fast
I'll move that, right?

13:31.894 --> 13:34.438
Who has my access?
Bro, I'll be back here in...

You want my bike as collateral?

13:44.240 --> 13:46.700
-I'll give you the bike as collateral.

13:49.119 --> 13:50.162
You stupid.

13:53.290 --> 13:54.500
Let me tell you somethin', man.

You screw me,
it's not just me that you're screwin'.

Heard, man. Loud and clear.

14:00.548 --> 14:01.590
[chuckles]

14:01.674 --> 14:04.885
[Barry] You got balls, kid.
I'll give you that. Two days.

14:04.969 --> 14:05.928
[Rafe] I got you.

14:06.011 --> 14:07.596
-Have faith in me, Barry.
-[Barry] Mm-hm.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.640
I appreciate it.
Thanks for coming through, bro!

14:10.099 --> 14:12.560
[John B] Pope, we're not stealing
the drone. We're borrowing it.

14:13.477 --> 14:16.522
"Humans are the only animal
that can't tell fantasy from reality."

14:16.605 --> 14:19.358
-[John B] Did you come up with that?
-Albert Bernstein came up with it,

14:19.441 --> 14:21.443
but it applies to this whole
treasure-hunting thing.

14:22.820 --> 14:25.322
-Oh.
-So, which is it?

14:26.073 --> 14:27.700
Fantasy or reality?

14:27.783 --> 14:29.368
Why are you so weird, Pope?

14:30.870 --> 14:33.789
It's fantasy, but possible reality.

14:35.457 --> 14:36.375
Reality.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.213
Virtual reality.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.133
Keep the signal clear.

14:48.345 --> 14:50.306
-[JJ] You know what your problem is?
-[Pope] You?

14:50.389 --> 14:53.601
[JJ] No! It's that you need to relax, man.
You're always so tense!

14:53.684 --> 14:55.019
[Pope] I'm not too tense.

14:55.102 --> 14:57.062
Hey, don't worry. You got this.

14:57.855 --> 14:59.648
It's not me that I'm worried about.

15:00.357 --> 15:01.275
[John B] Got it.

15:01.859 --> 15:03.193
Let's hope this works.

15:04.028 --> 15:04.987

I was wondering
if maybe you could help me out?

15:23.172 --> 15:24.048
Yeah.

15:24.131 --> 15:25.299
-[Kie] Yeah?
-Yeah.

It's too easy.

15:30.804 --> 15:32.348
[JJ] How's it going with Kiara?

15:32.431 --> 15:35.643
-It's not awkward, weird, or anything.
-[JJ snorts]

15:35.726 --> 15:36.560
Yeah.

15:36.644 --> 15:39.063
Honestly, I did not think
you were gonna actually listen to me.

15:39.146 --> 15:40.022
What?

15:40.439 --> 15:42.733
-I was 100 percent sure she was into you.
-[sighs]

15:42.816 --> 15:45.069
-Pope would agree.
-Ehh...

15:45.986 --> 15:49.239
So, like, Kie, she, like,
definitely gave you the Heisman?

15:49.323 --> 15:50.658
Oh, no question. Yup.

15:51.158 --> 15:51.992
Gotcha.

15:52.534 --> 15:54.745
-[chuckles]
-Maybe she's just into somebody else.

15:56.538 --> 15:58.332
It's just this back one right here.

15:58.415 --> 16:00.501

Right there is the Big Dipper.

21:50.892 --> 21:52.269
-Right-- No.
-[Topper] Right...

21:52.352 --> 21:54.271
-[Sarah] Right-- Yes. Mm-hm.
-[Topper] Okay, yup.

21:54.354 --> 21:57.816
[Sarah] And then those two stars
in the scoop point…

21:59.484 --> 22:01.361
[Topper] To the North Star, right?

22:01.445 --> 22:02.529
[Sarah] Yeah.

22:02.946 --> 22:04.865
It's the only star that doesn't move.

22:07.034 --> 22:08.952
Everything else spins around that.

22:10.829 --> 22:11.955
[chuckles]

22:12.039 --> 22:14.249
I love that you think about things
like that.

22:26.678 --> 22:29.139
You know you have
nothing to be jealous of, right?

22:29.723 --> 22:30.766
Jealous?

22:31.433 --> 22:33.268
-Topper, what?
-[laughs]

22:33.352 --> 22:36.188
Me, Topper, getting jealous?
What are you talking about?

22:40.525 --> 22:42.944
I promise not to put you in that position.

22:52.746 --> 22:54.122
[sighs]

22:58.794 --> 23:00.796
[both breathing heavily]

23:09.805 --> 23:11.139
-What?
-Yes.

23:12.307 --> 23:13.183
What?

23:17.187 --> 23:18.522
-You sure?
-Mm-hm.

23:19.481 --> 23:20.399
Positive.

23:31.993 --> 23:33.161
Okay.

23:47.509 --> 23:48.552
[Topper] I love you.

23:59.688 --> 24:01.231
Topper, no, no, no, no.

24:02.566 --> 24:03.442
What?

24:04.067 --> 24:05.569
-[Sarah] I'm sorry.
-Hey, what?

24:05.652 --> 24:06.611
[Sarah] I'm sorry.

24:07.362 --> 24:08.321
What? Did I...

24:10.323 --> 24:12.492
-Hey, did I-- did I do something?
-No.

24:12.576 --> 24:15.579
-[Topper] What's wrong?
-Just, um...

24:16.204 --> 24:18.290
I just feel a little buzzed.

24:22.544 --> 24:24.754
So what? So that was just...

24:27.466 --> 24:30.051
that was just some-- a mistake, or...

24:30.135 --> 24:32.220
-Topper, please don't get mad right now.
-What? No, no.

24:32.304 --> 24:34.681
I'm not mad. I'm just--
I'm just trying to figure you out,

24:34.764 --> 24:37.809
'cause one minute you're all over me,
and then the next minute, I'm in lockdown.

24:37.893 --> 24:40.270
So I'm just trying to figure out,
are you into this or not?

24:41.521 --> 24:44.566
Here's the thing. I guess it just happened
so fast, and I don't...

24:46.276 --> 24:48.195
It was just a-- a lot.

24:49.529 --> 24:50.572
All right, whatever.

24:55.535 --> 24:56.369
[whispers] Shit.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.458
-[girl] Forty. Here's 60.
-You got 60?

25:01.541 --> 25:03.627
You got 60? 40.

25:03.710 --> 25:07.130
You know, 40 isn't enough for the amount
of coke you've been doing tonight,

25:07.214 --> 25:08.840
but I'll let it slide this time.

25:11.218 --> 25:12.177
[Kelce] Whoo!

25:13.053 --> 25:14.137
Oh-ho!

25:14.221 --> 25:15.847
Top! Hey! Top! Top!

25:15.931 --> 25:18.600
Hey, everybody.
Hey, this is Top, all right?

25:18.683 --> 25:21.228
I call him the Shred God.
He goes Conan on overheads, right?

25:21.311 --> 25:22.270
What were you last year?

25:22.354 --> 25:24.856
-You were, like, top ten.
-Last year, uh, seventh in Nationals.

25:24.940 --> 25:26.691
-Oh!
-[Rafe] He was seventh in Nationals.

25:26.775 --> 25:27.859
-Wow.
-[Rafe] Girls, look.

25:27.943 --> 25:30.070
Take a seat. Sit down. Sit down, man!

25:30.153 --> 25:32.405
-All right, all right.
-Hey. Hey.

25:32.489 --> 25:33.406
You want a bump?

25:34.115 --> 25:35.367
A bump? Um...

25:35.450 --> 25:36.785
-It tastes like bananas.
-[laughs]

25:36.868 --> 25:37.827
Yeah?

25:39.412 --> 25:41.414
-Yeah, I don't know…
-[Rafe] Hey.

25:41.498 --> 25:43.458
If you don't hit it, then I will.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.585
-[laughter]
-It's true, man. She's been pulling, like,

25:45.669 --> 25:47.295
I don't know, half a gram tonight?

25:47.379 --> 25:49.548
-No, let's... Yeah, let's do it. Yeah.
-[girl] Yeah.

25:49.631 --> 25:51.174
-Do you want to do one?
-Yeah. Let's go.

25:51.258 --> 25:52.759
-[laughs]
-[Topper] Let's do a line.

25:57.389 --> 25:58.306
Oh!

25:58.390 --> 26:00.141
-Oh.
-[girl laughs] Uh...

26:00.225 --> 26:01.309
[coughs]

26:01.393 --> 26:03.144
Whoa, whoa. Hey, take it easy, man.

26:03.228 --> 26:05.564
-This is your first rodeo, is it?
-Hell, no, it's not!

26:05.647 --> 26:06.523
-All right!
-No, bro.

26:06.606 --> 26:09.276
-Let's do another one.
-What? What? Let's... let's do it!

26:09.359 --> 26:10.735
-[Kelce] Let's go, Top!
-Come on.

26:10.819 --> 26:12.821
[rock music playing on radio]

26:15.073 --> 26:16.741
[Kie] Stealing drones makes you hungry.

26:17.242 --> 26:19.828
What I would do to a beer
and shrimp and grits right now.

26:19.911 --> 26:21.079
[Pope] It would not be pretty.

26:21.538 --> 26:22.706
[sighs]

26:22.789 --> 26:24.165
-Hey, Dad.
-[Mr. C] Hey.

26:24.249 --> 26:25.125
How'd we do?

26:25.750 --> 26:27.085
Didn't turn it over once.

26:28.503 --> 26:31.131
It's probably just bad luck
because of the storm.

26:31.214 --> 26:33.508
Yeah, I'll be sure to tell the banks that.

26:34.968 --> 26:38.972
Guess now is not the best time to ask
for free food for me and my friends?

26:39.055 --> 26:40.599
[sighs]

26:41.349 --> 26:42.225
Look at them.

26:42.934 --> 26:44.686
-They're greedy pelicans.
-[John B] So hungry.

26:45.895 --> 26:47.397
I told you to stop
hanging around them.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.441
Well, everybody at the Kook Academy
hates me, Dad.

26:49.524 --> 26:52.360
-'Cause you never gave them a chance.
-[Kie] I did give them a chance.

26:52.444 --> 26:54.821
They got stuck up.
They care more about shoes than surfing.

26:54.904 --> 26:57.240
-What am I supposed to do with that?
-[sighs]

26:58.116 --> 27:00.368
[sighs] These are my friends.

27:03.038 --> 27:04.914
[chuckles]

27:04.998 --> 27:06.124
Look. [sighs]

27:06.541 --> 27:08.627
Well, I-- I got-- I gotta throw it out.

27:09.294 --> 27:10.795
Might as well take it.

27:12.797 --> 27:15.008
-Thank you!
-[Mr. C] You're welcome.

27:16.092 --> 27:17.886
-I'll bring it out.
-Sit down.

-All right.

in my nets.

I'm listening.

29:27.098 --> 29:28.183
[sighs]

29:30.226 --> 29:31.936
I told Topper I was ready.

-You did?
-Yeah.

29:37.484 --> 29:38.401
Then...

I don't know, I-- I couldn't do it.

-Yeah.

-He's a stomper.

29:50.830 --> 29:53.249
Well, it has to feel right.
That's what you always say.

I know, but it did feel right.

He was so sweet the entire day.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.133
Well, why didn't you, then?

30:07.263 --> 30:08.264
I don't know.

30:13.561 --> 30:15.480
-[JJ] What's this?
-[Pope] Don't touch that.

30:15.563 --> 30:16.940
I'm trying to work out this thing.

30:24.781 --> 30:27.116
God bless geeks, Pope. Truly, man.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.285
What would we do without you
to control the drones?

30:29.369 --> 30:31.579
-[Pope] It's not a drone. It's an ROV.
-Shut up. Shut up.

30:31.663 --> 30:34.916
-It's too early for that right now.
-Hey, once we get footage of the wreck,

30:34.999 --> 30:37.752
we'll bring it to a lawyer in town
and file a formal claim.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.420
It's bullshit. Why do we have to do that?

30:39.504 --> 30:41.339
Well, there is maritime salvage law.

30:41.422 --> 30:44.133
You can't just go to the ocean floor
and scoop a bunch of stuff up.

30:44.217 --> 30:46.469
I know. I know.
It's just lawyers aren't cheap, bro.

30:46.553 --> 30:48.805
As soon as they see the footage,
they'll work for a comp.

30:49.222 --> 30:50.431
How do you know all of that?

for the right weather.

31:26.050 --> 31:27.510
Uh, for what?

31:30.179 --> 31:31.681
To ask me what I'm doing here.

31:32.557 --> 31:33.600
What are you doing here?

31:33.683 --> 31:36.060
[Sarah] I didn't get a chance
to respond the other day

31:36.144 --> 31:38.855
after you spat in my face
and yelled at me,

31:38.938 --> 31:40.857
and you stormed off like a child.

31:42.650 --> 31:44.903
So, first of all, I'm not a liar.

about the scuba gear,

31:53.953 --> 31:55.622
I'm not the reason you got fired.

31:56.664 --> 31:57.624
Okay.

That's all. Good talk.

over to Figure Eight.

for you lazy sons of...

-...sons of bitches.
-[Pope] Right.

32:34.577 --> 32:36.704
Doesn't even look like
the storm hit there.

32:36.788 --> 32:39.624
That's because they got generators, bro.
Get used to it.

32:40.416 --> 32:42.877
And then they say the juice will be out
all summer at the cut.

when I did the line was…

"Bro, do we have enough?"

32:55.640 --> 32:57.225
-It was crazy!
-I know, right?

32:57.308 --> 32:58.685
-That was good shit.
-Yeah.

Hey, you, uh...
you didn't tell Sarah, did you?

Are you kidding me, man?
The way she runs her mouth?

Hell, no.

33:20.081 --> 33:21.040
Hey, what?

33:22.583 --> 33:24.002

33:24.836 --> 33:26.254
It's fine, just-- just let him go.

33:26.337 --> 33:29.674
All right, let's, uh...
let's go get your ball. Come on.

33:29.757 --> 33:33.177
-They put a gun to your head, bro.
-That's fine. It's fine. Let's go.

Hey, Rafe. Rafe! Let's get your ball, man.

33:40.935 --> 33:42.645
Hey, how much for one of those beers?

33:43.896 --> 33:44.981
They're not for sale.

33:45.398 --> 33:47.900
