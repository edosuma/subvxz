WEBVTT

00:12.233 --> 00:14.433
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:14.467 --> 00:16.600
THIS IS MARY DALTRY. SHE LOST
CONSCIOUSNESS BEHIND THE WHEEL.

00:16.633 --> 00:18.733
HOW'S SHANE--MY PARTNER?
I JUST DIDN'T
WANT HER TO SEE.

00:18.767 --> 00:22.367
I THOUGHT SHE MIGHT
TAKE OFFENSE.
CAN YOU GET MY WIFE?

00:22.400 --> 00:25.133
BABY?
YOU'RE GONNA DRILL
INTO MY SKULL?

00:25.167 --> 00:27.100
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
THE NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM IS DEAD?

00:27.133 --> 00:29.833
DAMN IT, STAN.
STAN. STAN.

00:29.867 --> 00:33.767
CAN I WATCH THE SURGERY?
CAN I--CAN YOU SNEAK ME IN?
(Izzie) YOU'RE BUSTED.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.033
(Meredith)
I'M GOING TO TELL HIM.

00:35.067 --> 00:36.567
I DON'T WANT HIM
SEEING OTHER PEOPLE.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.500
WHAT?

00:38.533 --> 00:40.433
NOTHING.
I'M... GONNA BE LATE.

00:40.467 --> 00:42.100
WE NEED TO TALK.

00:42.133 --> 00:45.500
MY WIFE GETS PANICKY IF SHE
DOESN'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
I WILL KEEP HER UPDATED.

00:45.533 --> 00:47.233
YOU SEEING ANYONE?

00:47.267 --> 00:49.133
AAH! AAH! AH!

00:51.067 --> 00:54.133
***

01:00.600 --> 01:02.500
(Meredith)
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

01:02.533 --> 01:04.433
THE EXPERIENCE
OF PRACTICING MEDICINE

01:04.467 --> 01:07.367
BEARS LITTLE RESEMBLANCE
TO THE DREAM.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.667
***

01:09.700 --> 01:11.233
HEY.

01:11.267 --> 01:13.533
ARE YOU--ARE YOU--
ARE YOU REALLY OKAY?

01:13.567 --> 01:16.067
YEAH. YEAH.

01:16.100 --> 01:18.333
ALEX, COME ON.
THAT WAS INTENSE--

01:18.367 --> 01:20.267
INTENSE AND CRAZY
AND JUST AWFUL.

01:20.300 --> 01:23.433
H-HOW CAN YOU BE OKAY
AFTER A DAY LIKE THAT?

01:23.467 --> 01:26.600
WE GO INTO MEDICINE
BECAUSE WE WANT TO SAVE LIVES.

01:26.633 --> 01:30.300
YOU DID A GOOD JOB TODAY,
AND IT WAS NOT EASY.

01:30.333 --> 01:32.667
WHAT YOU DID WAS NOT EASY.

01:32.700 --> 01:34.167
IT WAS BRAVE.

01:34.200 --> 01:37.133
WE GO INTO MEDICINE
BECAUSE WE WANT TO DO GOOD.

01:37.167 --> 01:40.833
***

01:40.867 --> 01:44.267
WE GO INTO MEDICINE
FOR THE RUSH, FOR THE HIGH,

01:44.300 --> 01:45.733
FOR THE RIDE.

01:45.767 --> 01:48.767
BUT WHAT WE REMEMBER
AT THE END OF MOST DAYS

01:48.800 --> 01:51.333
ARE THE LOSSES.

01:51.367 --> 01:53.400
WHAT WE LIE AWAKE
AT NIGHT REPLAYING

01:53.433 --> 01:55.667
IS THE PAIN WE CAUSED...

01:55.700 --> 01:57.500
***

01:57.533 --> 02:00.067
THE ILLS WE COULDN'T CURE...

02:00.100 --> 02:02.433
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO DATE OTHER PEOPLE.

02:02.467 --> 02:05.333
IT MAY NOT BE ENOUGH FOR YOU,
BUT I'M TRYING HERE.

02:05.367 --> 02:08.667
I DON'T WANT YOU TO DATE
ANYBODY BUT ME.

02:08.700 --> 02:11.167
THE LIVES WE RUINED...

02:11.200 --> 02:14.600
OR FAILED TO SAVE.

02:17.700 --> 02:19.600
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

02:19.633 --> 02:22.367
THE REALITY
IS NOTHING LIKE WE HOPE.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.200
THE REALITY IS,

02:24.233 --> 02:27.067
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
MORE OFTEN THAN NOT,

02:27.100 --> 02:30.500
TURNED INSIDE OUT
AND UPSIDE DOWN.

02:30.533 --> 02:31.600
OVER HERE!

02:31.633 --> 02:34.833
MEREDITH, GET IN THERE.
WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO LOSE.

02:34.867 --> 02:37.800
OKAY. I GOT THE SHIRT OPEN.
I'M ALMOST THERE.

02:37.833 --> 02:39.333
AAH! AAH!
STOP!

02:39.367 --> 02:42.500
STOP! STOP!
JUST HOLD STILL! OKAY.

02:42.533 --> 02:44.433
OKAY, THAT'S IT.
I GOT--I GOT IT.

02:44.467 --> 02:46.333
IT STOPPED. I GOT IT.
AH.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.833
HOLY CRAP.
MY ARTERY BLEW.

02:48.867 --> 02:51.733
YOUR ARTERY BLEW.
I DIDN'T THINK
THAT WOULD REALLY HAPPEN.

02:51.767 --> 02:53.667
I MEAN, I THOUGHT
IT WAS SOMETHING

02:53.700 --> 02:55.600
THAT THE DOCTORS SAY
MIGHT HAPPEN

02:55.633 --> 02:57.667
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO,

02:57.700 --> 03:00.567
BUT I DIDN'T THINK
THAT IT WOULD REALLY HAPPEN.
ME NEITHER.

03:00.600 --> 03:01.633
(monitor beeps)

03:04.600 --> 03:06.567
THEIR LOCAL TECH'S
IN SPOKANE.

03:06.600 --> 03:08.267
THAT'S FIVE HOURS AWAY.

03:08.300 --> 03:10.433
DID YOU TELL THEM I WAS IN
THE MIDDLE OF SOMEBODY'S BRAIN?

03:10.467 --> 03:12.800
YES. THE TECH IS STILL
IN SPOKANE.

03:12.833 --> 03:15.167
YOU CAN'T JUST
PULL THE PROBES OUT

03:15.200 --> 03:17.100
AND GO TO
A FULL CRANIOTOMY?

03:17.133 --> 03:19.600
NO. WHY NOT?
UH, THE PROBE
IS IN THE TUMORS.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.533
PULLING OUT WITHOUT
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM

03:21.567 --> 03:23.067
COULD DAMAGE THE BRAIN TISSUE.

03:23.100 --> 03:24.833
AND YOU CAN'T LEAVE
THE PROBE IN VERY LONG

03:24.867 --> 03:26.367
WITHOUT RISKING SWELLING.

03:26.400 --> 03:27.733
THAT'S GOOD.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

03:27.767 --> 03:30.133
TWO. STEVE. STEVE MOSTOW.
DR. STEVE MOSTOW, INTERN.

03:30.167 --> 03:33.233
ALL RIGHT, STEVE, I NEED YOU
TO RUN TO THE NURSES' STATION.

03:33.267 --> 03:35.467
TELL THEM TO MAKE
AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

03:35.500 --> 03:38.267
TELL THEM WE NEED COMPUTER
TECHNICIANS IN O.R. THREE.

03:38.300 --> 03:40.200
GO FAST, AND SCRUB IN
ON YOUR WAY BACK.
YES, SIR.

03:40.233 --> 03:41.733
DR. SHEPHERD.
YES.

03:41.767 --> 03:42.833
I DID THREE SEMESTERS

03:42.867 --> 03:44.833
IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
BEFORE I SWITCHED TO NURSING.

03:44.867 --> 03:46.767
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG,

03:46.800 --> 03:49.033
BUT IF IT'S SOMETHING
REASONABLY BASIC, I...

03:49.067 --> 03:50.800
I'D FEEL A LOT BETTER
ABOUT THIS

03:50.833 --> 03:53.133
IF YOUR VOICE WASN'T SHAKING.
MY VOICE SHAKES
WHEN I'M NERVOUS.

03:53.167 --> 03:54.367
I'M AN IMPERFECT PERSON,

03:54.400 --> 03:56.533
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN
I CAN'T FIX THE COMPUTER.

03:56.567 --> 03:58.467
ALL RIGHT,
ROSE HAS THREE SEMESTERS

03:58.500 --> 04:00.833
OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AT--
WHAT SCHOOL DID YOU GO TO?
SANTA CRUZ.

04:00.867 --> 04:03.733
THAT'S A PARTY SCHOOL.
YOU WANT TO INSULT MY EDUCATION,
OR DO YOU WANT ME TO TRY

04:03.767 --> 04:06.500
AND HELP YOU
SAVE YOUR PATIENT?
OKAY, WHO CAN BEAT
THREE SEMESTERS

04:06.533 --> 04:08.433
OF COMPUTER SCIENCE
AT SANTA CRUZ?

04:08.467 --> 04:11.533
ANYBODY?
OKAY, GIVE IT A SHOT.

04:11.567 --> 04:15.133
I APPRECIATE
THE VOTE OF CONFIDENCE.

04:15.167 --> 04:17.067
(Meredith)
CAN YOU SEE ANYTHING YET?

04:17.100 --> 04:19.067
UH, I SEE
THE DIAPHRAGM MOVING.

04:19.100 --> 04:21.433
MOVE IT UP A LITTLE MORE.

04:21.467 --> 04:23.367
OKAY, MEREDITH.
I'M WORKING ON IT.

04:23.400 --> 04:27.033
(strained voice) YOU'RE NOT
DOING A VERY GOOD JOB.

04:27.067 --> 04:30.200
I AM DOING A DAMN FINE JOB.
DON'T YOU WORRY.

04:30.233 --> 04:32.567
(breathes raspily)

04:32.600 --> 04:34.500
CAN YOU--CAN YOU--
CAN YOU CLOSE HIS EYES?

04:34.533 --> 04:35.467
WHAT?

04:35.500 --> 04:37.533
STAN--

04:37.567 --> 04:39.600
CAN YOU--
CAN YOU CLOSE HIS EYES?

04:41.300 --> 04:44.433
I'M SORRY... SO SORRY.

04:46.700 --> 04:48.833
MEREDITH, UM, UH, STOP.

04:48.867 --> 04:51.733
STOP RIGHT THERE.
I WANT TO FREEZE THAT FRAME.

04:51.767 --> 04:54.100
YEAH, HIS PERICARDIUM'S
FULL OF BLOOD.

04:54.133 --> 04:56.467
THAT'S NOT GOOD.
THAT'S NOT GOOD AT ALL.

04:56.500 --> 04:58.667
OXYGEN, I.V. START KITS.
ARNIE, MONITOR.

04:58.700 --> 05:00.367
UH, YOU,
PERICARDIOCENTESIS KIT.

05:00.400 --> 05:01.567
HIS ANATOMY'S ALL SCREWED UP

05:01.600 --> 05:04.300
BECAUSE HE'S HANGING
UPSIDE DOWN.

05:04.333 --> 05:06.700
GET SOMEONE FROM CARDIO. GO.

05:08.567 --> 05:11.433
I GOT TUCKER WAITING FOR ME IN
THE LOBBY, AND I'M ALREADY LATE.

05:11.467 --> 05:12.800
DO ME A FAVOR

05:12.833 --> 05:14.733
AND TAKE THE PATIENT
THROUGH THE POST-OP.

05:14.767 --> 05:16.567
WHAT?

05:16.600 --> 05:19.567
OKAY, I WANTED TO SAY
THAT WHEN YOU TOOK ME OFF

05:19.600 --> 05:21.667
OF HAHN'S SERVICE TODAY--
DR. BAILEY, THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG WITH HIM.

05:21.700 --> 05:23.700
HIS BLOOD PRESSURE'S
BOTTOMED OUT.

05:23.733 --> 05:26.167
DR. BAILEY?
O'MALLEY...

05:26.200 --> 05:27.300
(monitor beeping rapidly)

05:27.333 --> 05:29.233
OKAY, I NEED YOU
TO TALK TO TUCKER.

05:29.267 --> 05:31.367
I NEED YOU
TO ASK HIM TO WAIT.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.300
AND HE'S NOT GOING TO BE
INCLINED TO WAIT,

05:33.333 --> 05:35.233
SO I NEED YOU
TO ASK HIM NICELY.

05:35.267 --> 05:37.700
CAN YOU PLEASE GO
AND ASK HIM NICELY TO WAIT?

05:37.733 --> 05:39.233
YES, MA'AM.
I WON'T BE LONG.

05:39.267 --> 05:40.567
(Erica)
YOU SEE THIS, STEVENS?

05:40.600 --> 05:42.133
THE STERNUM'S CLEANED OUT,

05:42.167 --> 05:44.067
WHICH MEANS
WE'RE ALMOST OUTTA HERE.

05:44.100 --> 05:45.833
YOU DON'T WANT TO STAY
AND WATCH ME WORK?

05:45.867 --> 05:47.333
(scoffs) YOU KNOW,

05:47.367 --> 05:48.733
IT'S OFFENSIVE,
DR. SLOAN, FLAT-OUT.

05:48.767 --> 05:51.367
I ASKED YOU IF YOU WANTED
TO STAY AND WATCH ME WORK.

05:51.400 --> 05:54.167
HOW'S THAT OFFENSIVE?
OH, AND NOW YOU PLAY DUMB?

05:54.200 --> 05:56.700
DOES THAT WORK FOR YOU
BECAUSE OF THE WAY YOU LOOK?
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

05:56.733 --> 05:58.667
I'M SAYING,
IF YOU WERE HOMELY,

05:58.700 --> 06:01.567
YOU WOULD'VE LOST YOUR JOB
A LONG TIME AGO.
(telephone rings)

06:01.600 --> 06:03.567
DR. HAHN, THE CHIEF NEEDS YOU
IN THE AMBULANCE BAY.

06:03.600 --> 06:06.567
WE HAVE A PARAMEDIC
WITH CARDIAC TAMPONADE.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.567
ALL RIGHTY, THEN.
LET'S GO, STEVENS.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.367
OKAY. UM...

06:10.400 --> 06:11.600
NICK, CAN, UH,

06:11.633 --> 06:13.600
CAN YOU REACH
YOUR CALL BUTTON?

06:13.633 --> 06:17.300
I THINK SO.
NO, NO, NO, NO.
DON'T MOVE THAT MUCH.

06:17.333 --> 06:18.767
AH. AH.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.100
OKAY, UM, UH...

06:20.133 --> 06:21.433
JUST...

06:21.467 --> 06:23.767
CAN--CAN YOU REACH
YOUR PHONE...

06:23.800 --> 06:25.300
WITHOUT MOVING VERY MUCH?

06:25.333 --> 06:27.633
I THINK SO. I THINK SO.
I GOT IT.

06:27.667 --> 06:29.167
OKAY, GOOD.
GOOD, GOOD, GOOD.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.600
OKAY, UM, DIAL--

06:30.633 --> 06:32.333
DIAL 8, OKAY?

06:32.367 --> 06:33.433
(Nick grunts)

06:33.467 --> 06:35.367
OKAY. OKAY.
IS THAT--IS THAT 8?

06:35.400 --> 06:36.567
OKAY, OKAY.
(telephone ringing)

06:36.600 --> 06:39.233
PUT IT TO MY EAR, OKAY?
YEAH.

06:39.267 --> 06:40.467
(woman)
Hello, Nurses' station.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.300
HI. HI, UH,
THIS IS DR. GREY.

06:42.333 --> 06:45.667
UM, YEAH, MR. HANSCOMB'S
CAROTID JUST BLEW.

06:45.700 --> 06:48.633
UH, C-C-CAN YOU PAGE
DR. SLOAN FOR ME, PLEASE?

06:48.667 --> 06:50.567
A-AND ALSO DR. YANG?
AND--AH!

06:50.600 --> 06:53.567
I'M GONNA GO AHEAD
AND CALL THIS A CODE BLUE.

06:53.600 --> 06:55.767
YES, CODE BLUE.
CAN YOU ANNOUNCE THAT, PLEASE?
Right away.

06:55.800 --> 06:58.433
THANK YOU. OKAY, YOU CAN
PUT IT DOWN NOW.

06:58.467 --> 07:00.567
CODE BLUE.
THAT MEANS I'M DEAD, RIGHT?

07:00.600 --> 07:03.600
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL
WHEN PEOPLE GO, LIKE, FLATLINE?

07:03.633 --> 07:06.633
NO. I FIGURE WE CAN USE
ALL THE HELP WE CAN GET.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.367
(pager beeping,
telephone ringing)
I DON'T CARE WHO IT IS.

07:17.400 --> 07:18.667
I DON'T CARE
WHO IT IS, JOLENE.

07:18.700 --> 07:20.800
I AM LEAVING THIS HOSPITAL
WHEN I AM FINISHED HERE.

07:20.833 --> 07:22.567
I DON'T CARE IF THE PATIENT
IS ON FIRE.

07:22.600 --> 07:26.467
I'M NOT SCRUBBING IN
ANYWHERE ELSE.
IT'S DR. YANG'S. LEXIE GREY
IS PAGING YOU 9-1-1.

07:26.500 --> 07:28.400
DR. YANG, YOUR INTERN CALLED
A CODE BLUE ON A PATIENT

07:28.433 --> 07:30.400
WHO APPARENTLY
IS NOT CODE BLUE.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

07:30.433 --> 07:33.200
WHY WOULD SHE CALL
A CODE IF--
GO FIND OUT.

07:33.233 --> 07:34.800
WELL, I THOUGHT
YOU NEEDED ME HERE.

07:34.833 --> 07:37.633
YOU SAID YOU NEEDED ME HERE,
AND THAT'S WHY YOU PULLED ME

07:37.667 --> 07:39.533
OFF OF CARDIO.
NO, I'M FINE.

07:39.567 --> 07:41.600
GO KICK SOME INTERN BUTT.

07:41.633 --> 07:42.833
HOW YOU DOING,
DR. GREY?

07:42.867 --> 07:44.800
LEXIE. I'M OKAY.
YOU OKAY?

07:44.833 --> 07:46.700
WELL,
I'M A LITTLE FREAKED OUT

07:46.733 --> 07:48.400
IF I'M BEING HONEST.

07:48.433 --> 07:50.567
MOSTLY 'CAUSE YOU LOOK LIKE
CARRIE AT THE PROM.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.500
SERIOUSLY, YOU'RE WEARING,
LIKE, HALF MY BLOOD.

07:52.533 --> 07:54.633
WHICH IS WHY WE'RE HANGING
SOME MORE RIGHT NOW.

07:54.667 --> 07:56.567
I'M HAVING TROUBLE
GETTING A VEIN.
(Lexie) WHY?

07:56.600 --> 07:59.033
HE'S HYPOVOLEMIC.
HIS VEINS ARE FLACCID.

07:59.067 --> 08:00.667
THAT'S NOT
A NICE THING TO SAY.

08:00.700 --> 08:03.333
THAT--THAT'S NOT A NICE THING
TO SAY AT ALL. OW!

08:03.367 --> 08:04.433
(groans)
OH! OH, OKAY.

08:04.467 --> 08:06.800
SON OF A BITCH!
IT'S OKAY!

08:06.833 --> 08:08.767
GREY, STOP THAT BLEEDING.
IT'S OKAY.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.467
STOP THE BLEEDING.
I--MY HAND SLIPPED.

08:10.500 --> 08:13.467
I-I GOT IT.
THAT--
THAT CAN'T HAPPEN ANYMORE.

08:13.500 --> 08:16.300
THAT CAN'T HAPPEN ANYMORE,
OKAY?
JUST APPLY STEADY,
FIRM PRESSURE.

08:16.333 --> 08:18.833
I-I CALLED FOR SLOAN. SHOULD WE
JUST TAKE HIM TO AN O.R. OR--

08:18.867 --> 08:21.733
NO, THERE'S NO O.R.
I WAS JUST DOWN THERE.
OH.

08:21.767 --> 08:25.133
TYLER, UH, YOU SHOULD RUN
AND GET SOME MORE BLOOD.

08:25.167 --> 08:27.100
JUST IN CASE, OKAY?

08:27.133 --> 08:29.433
KEEP APPLYING PRESSURE.
I'M GONNA GO GET SLOAN.
WAIT, YOU'RE LEAVING?

08:29.467 --> 08:32.767
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. YOU CAN
DO THIS. YOU'RE DOING THIS.

08:34.567 --> 08:36.533
ARE YOU SEEING THIS,
KAREV?

08:36.567 --> 08:38.800
HOW I'M TIGHTENING
THE CABLE BY HAND?

08:38.833 --> 08:41.400
YEAH.

08:41.433 --> 08:44.067
THAT'S MY FACE.

08:44.100 --> 08:46.500
WHAT?
UP THERE IN THE GALLERY,
I BUILT THAT FACE.

08:46.533 --> 08:48.800
THAT'S JANE DOE.
THE ONE WITH AMNESIA.

08:48.833 --> 08:51.267
IS SHE A SURGEON?
I DON'T, UH...

08:51.300 --> 08:53.400
OH, YOU ARE--
YOU ARE SO BUSTED.

08:53.433 --> 08:55.433
DR. SLOAN, IT'S NICK HANSCOMB.
HIS CAROTID BLEW.

08:55.467 --> 08:57.167
KAREV, I NEED YOU
TO IRRIGATE THOROUGHLY,

08:57.200 --> 08:59.600
FINISH UP
AND PACK THE WOUND.
WAIT, YOU'RE LEAVING?

08:59.633 --> 09:02.400
HE CAN SURVIVE WITHOUT ME.
MY OTHER GUY CAN'T.
OH, THERE'S NO O.R.
AVAILABLE.

09:02.433 --> 09:04.067
THIS ONE WILL BE.

09:04.100 --> 09:06.267
I NEED YOU TO GET THIS ROOM
TURNED AROUND ASAP.

09:06.300 --> 09:08.633
I'M BRINGING DOWN
MY CAROTID BLEED.

09:08.667 --> 09:10.500
TUCKER.

09:10.533 --> 09:11.733
HEY.

09:11.767 --> 09:13.667
SHE'S BUSY, RIGHT?
SHE CAN'T MAKE LUNCH?

09:13.700 --> 09:15.833
NO, SHE CAN.
SHE CAN MAKE LUNCH.

09:15.867 --> 09:18.767
JUST A SLIGHTLY LATER LUNCH.
SHE'S IN SURGERY.
ALWAYS IS.

09:18.800 --> 09:22.633
YEAH, IT'S JUST TAKING
A LITTLE LONGER THAN SHE EX--
ALWAYS DOES. (clears throat)

09:22.667 --> 09:24.567
SHE'S HAVING
A REALLY BAD DAY.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.733
SHE'S SAVING THE LIFE
OF A WHITE SUPREMACIST.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.400
THIS IS NOT A GOOD DAY.

09:28.433 --> 09:31.300
SO SHE ASKED ME TO ASK YOU
IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND

09:31.333 --> 09:33.233
JUST WAITING JUST A LITTLE
WHILE LONGER, PLEASE.

09:33.267 --> 09:34.833
SHE DID SAY PLEASE,

09:34.867 --> 09:36.367
WHICH, AS YOU MAY KNOW,

09:36.400 --> 09:38.800
IS NOT A WORD SHE USES
THAT FREQUENTLY, SO...

09:38.833 --> 09:40.533
SHE REALLY IS SORRY.

09:40.567 --> 09:42.467
IT--THIS SHOULDN'T BE
MUCH LONGER.

09:42.500 --> 09:45.367
FINE. BUT TELL MIRANDA I SAID
DON'T KEEP ME WAITING LONG.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.433
PLEASE.

09:47.467 --> 09:49.067
OKAY.

09:51.067 --> 09:52.467
(Sandra) LUCY.

09:55.733 --> 09:57.633
UH, IF IT'S ALL RIGHT
WITH YOU,

09:57.667 --> 09:59.567
I'D LIKE TO UPDATE
MR. NOLSTON'S FAMILY

09:59.600 --> 10:01.500
AND MEET YOU
IN THE AMBULANCE BAY.

10:01.533 --> 10:03.467
(sighs)

10:03.500 --> 10:04.700
HE'S YOUR PATIENT.

10:04.733 --> 10:06.633
DON'T YOU WANT ME
TO KEEP THE FAMILY INFORMED?

10:06.667 --> 10:08.567
I WANT YOU TO THINK LIKE
A SURGEON.

10:08.600 --> 10:10.500
YOU'RE THINKING LIKE
A SOCIAL WORKER,

10:10.533 --> 10:12.433
AND IF YOU WANT TO BE
A SOCIAL WORKER,

10:12.467 --> 10:14.367
YOU CAN SAVE YOURSELF
A LOT OF EFFORT,

10:14.400 --> 10:16.300
BECAUSE THE TRAINING
IS 2 YEARS, NOT 12.

10:16.333 --> 10:18.600
BUT IF YOU WANT TO BE
A SURGEON,

10:18.633 --> 10:21.100
YOU CAN UPDATE THE FAMILY
WHEN THE CRISIS HAS PASSED.

10:21.133 --> 10:24.033
YOU'RE RIGHT. ABSOLUTELY.
I'M SORRY. I...

10:28.467 --> 10:30.367
STEVE.
UH, YES, SIR?

10:30.400 --> 10:32.600
DID YOU BRING ANYBODY
WITH YOU?

10:32.633 --> 10:34.533
UH, NO. THE NURSES MADE
AN ANNOUNCEMENT,

10:34.567 --> 10:36.433
AND I WAITED,
BUT NO ONE CAME.
ROSE?

10:36.467 --> 10:39.233
DAMN. DAMN IT,
DAMN IT, DAMN IT.
ROSE.

10:39.267 --> 10:41.767
I DON'T HAVE THE STEADIEST HAND.
I NEED TO RECONNECT SOME WIRES,

10:41.800 --> 10:43.567
AND I DON'T HAVE
THE STEADIEST HAND,

10:43.600 --> 10:47.033
AND WHEN YOU TALK TO ME,
IT IS LESS STEADY.
SO IT'S ABOUT THE WIRES?

10:47.067 --> 10:49.067
I THINK SO.
I'M PRETTY SURE.
ALL RIGHT. I'LL DO IT.

10:49.100 --> 10:51.433
WHAT?
I'LL DO IT. YOU SAID YOURSELF
YOU DON'T HAVE STEADY HANDS.

10:51.467 --> 10:54.667
BECAUSE I'M NERVOUS.
YEAH, NO, I GOT THAT.
LET ME TAKE CARE OF THE WIRES.

10:54.700 --> 10:58.367
I'M A NEUROSURGEON.
I HAVE STEADY HANDS.
YOU'RE HOLDING THE LEADS
IN THE PATIENT'S BRAIN.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.367
OKAY. STEVE, HOW'S YOUR HAND?
IS IT STEADY?

11:00.400 --> 11:02.067
UH, YES, SIR.

11:02.100 --> 11:04.667
GOOD. IT BETTER BE
OR YOU'LL KILL MY PATIENT.

11:04.700 --> 11:07.067
HOLD THIS VERY, VERY STILL.
YES, SIR.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.667
VERY STILL. GOOD.

11:12.100 --> 11:13.433
STERILE SLEEVES,
GLOVES, PLEASE.

11:13.467 --> 11:15.600
TELL ME
WHAT I'VE GOT TO DO.
OKAY.

11:17.500 --> 11:18.567
YOU TALKED TO TUCKER?

11:18.600 --> 11:22.233
YES. HE SAYS AS LONG
AS YOU'RE OUT SOON, HE'LL WAIT.

11:22.267 --> 11:24.300
OH, MOTHER OF...
THE HEPATIC VEIN WAS INJURED.

11:24.333 --> 11:27.800
UH, CAN YOU CHECK
FOR A NEW MURMUR?
YEAH, CHECKING NOW.

11:27.833 --> 11:30.167
O'MALLEY, I NEED YOU
TO GO TALK TO TUCKER.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.800
JUST ASK HIM
TO WAIT A LITTLE LONGER.
BUT I JUST SCRUBBED IN.

11:32.833 --> 11:35.000
O'MALLEY, ASK HIM.
YES, MA'AM.

11:46.433 --> 11:50.267
A PERSON
CAN ONLY RISE SO HIGH.

11:50.300 --> 11:52.067
NOW I'M RISING ABOVE,

11:52.100 --> 11:54.833
BUT THERE'S A CEILING,
AND I'M ABOUT TO HIT IT.

11:54.867 --> 11:56.767
(monitor beeping erratically)

11:56.800 --> 11:59.300
LET ME GUESS. AIR EMBOLUS?

11:59.333 --> 12:00.600
(sighs)

12:00.633 --> 12:02.233
(beeping continues)

12:02.267 --> 12:04.500
WE'RE ABOUT TO START
THE PERICARDIOCENTESIS.

12:04.533 --> 12:06.433
BUT WITH THE POSITION
OF HIS BODY,

12:06.467 --> 12:09.333
THE BLOOD WON'T BE POOLED
TO THE BASE OF THE HEART,

12:09.367 --> 12:12.233
SO I--
I'D STILL USE THE SUBXIPHOID
RATHER THAN THE PARASTERNAL.

12:12.267 --> 12:14.133
RIGHT. OKAY.

12:14.167 --> 12:17.200
MEREDITH, DID YOU HEAR THAT?
YEAH. IS THE KIT READY YET?

12:17.233 --> 12:20.500
YEAH, I'M GETTING IT
READY FOR YOU NOW.

12:20.533 --> 12:22.367
(Meredith)
HOW YOU DOING, RAY?

12:22.400 --> 12:24.467
GREY, YOU'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL
WITH THIS TECHNIQUE.

12:24.500 --> 12:27.600
IF YOU AIM THE NEEDLE
INCORRECTLY, YOU COULD NICK

12:27.633 --> 12:30.833
THE VERY-THIN-WALLED
RIGHT ATRIUM.
WHICH COULD CAUSE
A CARDIAC RUPTURE.

12:30.867 --> 12:32.367
A CARDIAC RUPTURE,
A TENSION PNEUMOTHORAX--

12:32.400 --> 12:34.367
BASICALLY THERE'S ABOUT
SIX DIFFERENT WAYS

12:34.400 --> 12:36.633
SHE COULD KILL HIM.
ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT ME?

12:36.667 --> 12:39.500
NO, DON'T LISTEN
TO THEM, RAY.

12:39.533 --> 12:41.800
DR. HAHN... SHUT UP.

12:44.433 --> 12:46.733
SIR, YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

12:46.767 --> 12:48.667
(siren wails)

12:48.700 --> 12:51.433
(lowers voice) STEVENS,
GO GET ME AN 18 GAUGE NEEDLE

12:51.467 --> 12:54.500
BEFORE THIS MAN'S HEART
EXPLODES IN HIS CHEST.
GOT IT.

13:02.400 --> 13:05.100
HOW YOU DOING, KAREV?

13:05.133 --> 13:07.200
YEAH, GOOD. I'M FINE.
MY NOSE ITCHES.

13:07.233 --> 13:10.467
IT ITCHES LIKE CRAZY.
YEAH, THAT'S THE ANXIETY.

13:10.500 --> 13:13.200
YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T SCRATCH IT,
SO IT ITCHES.
(chuckles)

13:13.233 --> 13:15.767
(monitor beeping erratically)
WHOA. WHAT DID YOU DO?

13:15.800 --> 13:18.633
NOTHING. I WAS IRRIGATING.
ALL RIGHT,
I NEED MORE SUCTION.

13:18.667 --> 13:22.167
LET'S GET SOME EXPOSURE HERE.
IT'S COMING
FROM INSIDE HIS CHEST.

13:22.200 --> 13:25.200
(Alex) I THINK HIS HEART'S
STARTING TO BLEED.

13:25.233 --> 13:28.100
HANG A UNIT OF BLOOD.
PAGE HAHN AND SLOAN, NOW!

13:28.133 --> 13:31.200
(beeping continues)

13:31.233 --> 13:33.667
TYLER, COULD YOU GET ME
MORE GAUZE, PLEASE?
YEAH, SURE.

13:33.700 --> 13:35.600
WHY DO YOU NEED MORE GAUZE?

13:35.633 --> 13:37.533
BECAUSE I'M BLEEDING?
I'M--I'M STILL BLEEDING?

13:37.567 --> 13:39.567
WELL, WE HAVE BLOOD
GOING IN, TOO, NICK.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.533
IS IT GOING IN AS FAST
AS IT'S GOING OUT?

13:41.567 --> 13:44.533
I'M ASKING BECAUSE I'M STARTING
TO FEEL, LIKE, QUEASY...

13:44.567 --> 13:47.167
AND WEAK, MAYBE LIKE A--

13:47.200 --> 13:50.167
A PERSON WHO'S LOSING
A LOT OF BLOOD.

13:50.200 --> 13:52.100
OKAY, I'M TRANSFERRING NOW,
NICK. YOU READY?

13:52.133 --> 13:53.000
YEAH.

13:54.467 --> 13:57.600
LEXIE...
SHOULD I BE CALLING PEOPLE?

13:57.633 --> 14:00.533
SHOULD I BE CALLING
MY FAMILY OR SOMEBODY?

14:00.567 --> 14:03.400
I THINK... I THINK
THE BLEEDING STOPPED.

14:03.433 --> 14:05.367
HOW YOU DOING, NICK?

14:05.400 --> 14:08.100
OH, DR. SLOAN.
IT'S DR. SLOAN.

14:08.133 --> 14:10.167
(Lexie) I THINK
THE BLEEDING STOPPED.
YOU OKAY?

14:10.200 --> 14:12.233
DO I--DO I LOOK OKAY?

14:12.267 --> 14:13.733
ACTUALLY, YOU DO.

14:13.767 --> 14:16.133
DR. GREY, LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT
THE BLEEDING UNDER CONTROL.

14:16.167 --> 14:19.600
(Lexie) WHY WOULD IT STOP?
IT COULD HAVE BEEN
THE HERALD BLEED, WHICH MEANS,

14:19.633 --> 14:22.567
UM, THERE'S A POSSIBILITY
OF IT BLEEDING AGAIN.
BUT IT WON'T, 'CAUSE I'M GONNA
GET IT CLOSED UP BEFORE IT DOES.

14:22.600 --> 14:25.233
(Nick and Lexie) THERE'S NO O.R.
THERE WILL BE
IN TEN MINUTES.

14:25.267 --> 14:27.167
DR. GREY, GET A PRESSURE
DRESSING ON THIS WOUND.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.400
DR. YANG, GET HIM PREPPED
FOR TRANSFER,

14:29.433 --> 14:31.200
AND STRAIGHT TO O.R. THREE.

14:31.233 --> 14:33.133
I'M GONNA MAKE SURE
IT'S CLEARED OUT.

14:33.167 --> 14:35.300
YOU DID GOOD WORK, GREY.
THANK YOU.

14:35.333 --> 14:36.667
HEY...

14:36.700 --> 14:38.600
I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU NOW.

14:38.633 --> 14:41.500
I'VE FORGOTTEN ENTIRELY
ABOUT MY EX.

14:41.533 --> 14:42.467
(sighs)

14:42.500 --> 14:44.700
(pager beeps)

14:44.733 --> 14:46.633
OH, COME ON.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

14:46.667 --> 14:49.533
WHAT?
OH, I HAVE A PATIENT
ON THE TABLE WHO'S--

14:49.567 --> 14:51.200
I GOTTA GO.
(Richard) ERICA--

14:51.233 --> 14:53.133
UH, STEVENS,
PAGE THE CARDIO FELLOW,

14:53.167 --> 14:54.367
THEN BOOK AN O.R.

14:54.400 --> 14:57.400
HAVE IT WAITING
WHEN THEY GET HIM FREE.

14:59.200 --> 15:02.467
(man) DR. TAYLOR.
PAGING DR. TAYLOR.

15:05.767 --> 15:07.667
WHY AM I NOT SURPRISED?
DR. BAILEY IS VERY SORRY.

15:07.700 --> 15:09.567
SHE'S VERY, VERY SORRY.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.500
I'M OUTTA HERE.
SHE JUST ASKED ME
TO ASK YOU

15:11.533 --> 15:14.500
IF YOU COULD WAIT JUST A--
A LITTLE WHILE LONGER.

15:14.533 --> 15:16.433
SHE'S ALMOST DONE WITH
THE SURGERY. IT TOOK A--

15:16.467 --> 15:18.367
IT'S JUST MORE COMPLICATED
THAN SHE EXPECTED,

15:18.400 --> 15:20.033
BUT SHE IS ALMOST DONE.

15:20.067 --> 15:22.267
FINE, I'LL WAIT.
BUT YOU TELL HER I AM TIRED,

15:22.300 --> 15:24.800
TIRED OF HER CHOOSING EVERYTHING
OVER ME AND OUR MARRIAGE.

15:24.833 --> 15:26.733
YOU TELL HER THIS IS
THE LAST TIME. I'M FINISHED.

15:26.767 --> 15:28.733
AND YOU TELL HER THE ONLY REASON
I'M STAYING HERE

15:28.767 --> 15:30.700
IS TO TELL HER THAT MYSELF.

15:30.733 --> 15:33.267
WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU DO, KAREV?
NOTHING.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.533
UH, I CUT THE CABLE.
THE BLEEDING--
YOU CUT THE CABLE?

15:35.567 --> 15:37.533
WHAT, YOU WERE SHOWING OFF
FOR YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

15:37.567 --> 15:39.300
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW SCREWED YOU ARE?

15:39.333 --> 15:41.500
IT'S NOT HIS FAULT.
ONE OF THE HEART GRAFT'S BLEW.

15:41.533 --> 15:43.833
I'M HOLDING THIS GUY'S
LEFT CORONARY WITH A CLAMP.
DID SOMEBODY PAGE HAHN?

15:43.867 --> 15:46.567
(Erica) I'M HERE.
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?
HIS HEART GRAFT BLEW.

15:46.600 --> 15:49.233
OH, DAMN IT.
(Alex) LOOK,
IF YOU NEED ME--

15:49.267 --> 15:51.700
(Mark) THE ONLY THING I NEED YOU
TO DO, KAREV, IS TO STAY QUIET

15:51.733 --> 15:54.567
AND GET MORE SUCTION IN HERE.
(Erica)
JUST HOLD ON TO THAT.

15:57.533 --> 15:59.200
O'MALLEY?

15:59.233 --> 16:01.600
YOUR HUSBAND IS WAITING.

16:01.633 --> 16:03.433
GOOD.

16:03.467 --> 16:04.767
HE'S WAITING AND--

16:04.800 --> 16:06.700
I HEARD YOU.
WHY AREN'T YOU SCRUBBED IN?

16:06.733 --> 16:08.733
I COULD USE A HAND.

16:08.767 --> 16:11.200
HE, UH, HE SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT YOU CHOOSING...

16:11.233 --> 16:14.433
(lowers voice)
EVERYTHING OVER YOUR MARRIAGE.

16:14.467 --> 16:16.767
HE SAID THAT?

16:16.800 --> 16:18.700
WHAT ELSE DID HE SAY?

16:18.733 --> 16:20.667
(normal voice) I THINK
THAT WAS ABOUT IT.

16:20.700 --> 16:22.733
YOU THINK OR YOU KNOW?

16:22.767 --> 16:25.633
(lowers voice) HE--HE SAID
THAT THIS WAS THE LAST TIME

16:25.667 --> 16:28.200
AND THAT HE WAS FINISHED.

16:28.233 --> 16:30.100
I'M IN SURGERY, O'MALLEY.

16:30.133 --> 16:31.300
DID YOU TELL HIM

16:31.333 --> 16:33.800
THAT I'M TRYING TO SAVE
A MAN'S LIFE HERE?

16:33.833 --> 16:34.767
YES.

16:34.800 --> 16:38.033
THAT I WANT TO BE THERE
WITH HIM RIGHT NOW,

16:38.067 --> 16:40.733
BUT IF I WERE TO LEAVE,
THIS MAN WOULD DIE,

16:40.767 --> 16:43.233
DID YOU TELL HIM THAT?
YEAH, YES.

16:43.267 --> 16:45.167
YOU NEED TO GO BACK OUT THERE
AND TELL HIM

16:45.200 --> 16:47.533
THAT I TOOK A VOW--
A VOW TO SAVE LIVES.

16:47.567 --> 16:49.300
AND HE MIGHT
WANT TO REMEMBER

16:49.333 --> 16:51.833
THAT HE ALSO TOOK A VOW--
FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE.

16:51.867 --> 16:54.200
YOU TELL HIM THAT IT'S
HIS JOB AS A HUSBAND

16:54.233 --> 16:55.700
TO UNDERSTAND THAT.

16:55.733 --> 16:58.067
YOU TELL HIM THAT
I'M STANDING BY MY VOW,

16:58.100 --> 16:59.567
FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE.

16:59.600 --> 17:02.033
YOU TELL HIM
I'M HOLDING HIM TO HIS VOW.

17:02.067 --> 17:04.767
YOU TELL HIM IF HE'S THINKING
ABOUT LEAVING RIGHT NOW,

17:04.800 --> 17:07.433
THAT HE MIGHT FIND HIMSELF
HURT AND WOUNDED

17:07.467 --> 17:08.633
AND NEEDING AN OPERATION,

17:08.667 --> 17:10.567
AND HE MAY NOT GET A SURGEON

17:10.600 --> 17:13.467
WHO IS AS MARRIED
TO HER VOWS AS I AM.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.533
YOU TELL HIM THAT.

17:15.567 --> 17:17.667
CAN'T I JUST DO SOME CHARTS?

17:17.700 --> 17:19.267
GO.

17:24.633 --> 17:26.733
(metal clicks)

17:26.767 --> 17:28.733
IT'S IN.
IT'S IN?

17:28.767 --> 17:30.567
WIRE'S IN.

17:32.533 --> 17:34.533
STEVE, ARE YOU STILL?

17:34.567 --> 17:36.400
YES, SIR. VERY STILL.

17:38.067 --> 17:41.200
STOP LOOKING AT ME
LIKE I KILLED YOUR PATIENT.

17:41.233 --> 17:44.833
I AM NOT A COMPUTER TECHNICIAN.
I DID MY BEST. I GAVE IT A SHOT.

17:44.867 --> 17:47.633
YOU DIDN'T DO YOUR BEST.
YES, I DID DO MY BEST.
IT WAS MY BEST, DAMN IT.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.800
SHH. CALM DOWN.
TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND THINK.

17:49.833 --> 17:52.467
WHAT DID YOU MISS?
WHAT ARE YOU FORGETTING?

17:57.167 --> 17:58.433
(beep)

17:58.467 --> 18:00.533
YOU FORGOT
THE RESTART BUTTON?

18:00.567 --> 18:03.500
I FORGOT TO PRESS
THE RESTART BUTTON.

18:03.533 --> 18:05.633
IT'S WORKING.
IT'S WORKING.

18:05.667 --> 18:08.233
IT'S WORKING.
IT'S WORKING. (laughs)

18:08.267 --> 18:11.533
SANTA CRUZ IS NOT
JUST A PARTY SCHOOL.
UH, DR. SHEPHERD.

18:11.567 --> 18:12.600
YES.

18:12.633 --> 18:15.000
UH, SLEEVES.
OH.

18:18.533 --> 18:21.400
THIS WAS NEVER MY PLAN, TO...

18:21.433 --> 18:23.067
TO DIE THIS WAY.

18:23.100 --> 18:25.267
YOU'RE NOT DYING, NICK.
(Cristina) YOU'RE GOING
TO THE O.R.

18:25.300 --> 18:27.200
NO, I KNOW.
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

18:27.233 --> 18:30.633
I MEAN, I THINK
WE KIND OF HAVE SOME SAY,

18:30.667 --> 18:33.267
OR AT LEAST A FEELING.

18:33.300 --> 18:35.200
BUT I NEVER HAD THAT FEELING,

18:35.233 --> 18:39.067
SO I CAN'T DIE, RIGHT?

18:41.333 --> 18:44.300
I DON'T FEEL GOOD.

18:44.333 --> 18:45.667
I FEEL...

18:45.700 --> 18:48.267
OH! NICK. NICK.
NICK. NICK, CAN YOU
SQUEEZE MY HAND?

18:48.300 --> 18:50.067
OH, MY GOD. WHAT HAPPENED?

18:50.100 --> 18:51.767
THE BLOOD TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF
HIS BRAIN IS--HE HAD A STROKE.

18:51.800 --> 18:53.267
IT LOOKS LIKE
HE HAD A STROKE.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.800
OKAY, LET'S GO.
LET'S MOVE HIM CAREFULLY.

18:55.833 --> 18:57.167
LET'S GO.

18:57.200 --> 18:58.733
YOU CAN'T CRY, LEXIE.

18:58.767 --> 19:00.733
THIS ISN'T OVER.
YOU CAN'T CRY.

19:00.767 --> 19:04.633
(monitor beeping erratically)

19:06.633 --> 19:09.467
YOU NEED TO FIND
THE XIPHOID PROCESS.

19:09.500 --> 19:10.833
CAN YOU FEEL IT?

19:10.867 --> 19:13.267
(breathing erratically)
GOT IT.

19:13.300 --> 19:15.200
OKAY, NOW GO
TWO FINGER BREADTHS

19:15.233 --> 19:18.600
TO THE LEFT OF THE XIPHOID.
I'M THERE.

19:18.633 --> 19:20.167
HERE.

19:21.800 --> 19:23.167
18 GAUGE.

19:23.200 --> 19:24.400
YEAH.

19:24.433 --> 19:26.333
THAT IS
A VERY BIG NEEDLE.

19:26.367 --> 19:29.667
I KNOW. I'M SORRY.
YOU'RE GOING TO ANGLE THE NEEDLE
TOWARD THE LEFT SHOULDER.

19:29.700 --> 19:32.433
DON'T STAB. YOU DON'T WANT
TO HIT THE VENTRICLE,

19:32.467 --> 19:35.267
AND YOU DON'T WANT
TO DROP THE LUNG.

19:35.300 --> 19:37.333
THAT WOULDN'T
HELP MATTERS EITHER.
I CHANGED MY MIND.
I WANT OUT.

19:37.367 --> 19:40.233
THIS IS GONNA HELP YOU, RAY.
I'M GONNA GO ON THREE, OKAY?

19:40.267 --> 19:42.333
ONE, TWO--

19:42.367 --> 19:44.067
WAIT.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.833
TELL--TELL STAN'S WIFE
I'M SORRY.

19:45.867 --> 19:48.667
T-TELL SARA
I'M SORRY ABOUT STAN.

19:48.700 --> 19:51.233
TELL HER YOURSELF.
ONE, TWO--

19:51.267 --> 19:52.600
WAIT. WAIT.

19:52.633 --> 19:55.533
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

19:55.567 --> 19:57.567
JUST WAIT A MINUTE.
OKAY.

19:57.600 --> 20:00.067
WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG?
HE'S NOT READY.

20:00.100 --> 20:01.733
I'M TRYING
NOT TO BE SCARED.

20:01.767 --> 20:04.633
I DON'T WANNA DIE SCARED.
I WANNA NOT BE SCARED.

20:04.667 --> 20:07.167
RAY, LISTEN TO ME.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.467
IT'S GOOD TO BE SCARED.

20:09.500 --> 20:13.267
IT MEANS YOU STILL HAVE
SOMETHING TO LOSE.

20:13.300 --> 20:15.800
YEAH?

20:15.833 --> 20:18.733
ARE YOU SCARED?

20:18.767 --> 20:22.500
ALL THE TIME.

20:23.733 --> 20:26.200
OKAY. THAT'S GOOD.

20:26.233 --> 20:29.133
OKAY. I'M READY.

20:29.167 --> 20:30.100
BUT DON'T--DON'T COUNT.
JUST DO IT.

20:30.133 --> 20:33.133
JUST DO IT SO I DON'T
KNOW IT'S... (gasps)

20:37.600 --> 20:39.567
THE INFECTION
WENT TO HIS HEART.

20:39.600 --> 20:41.500
HIS HACK OF A SURGEON
DIDN'T CHECK THE GRAFTS.

20:41.533 --> 20:44.167
I SHOULD'VE CAUGHT IT.
I SHOULD'VE CHECKED.

20:44.200 --> 20:46.633
I MISSED IT. DAMN IT.
HOW DID I MISS IT?

20:46.667 --> 20:49.033
STUPID. STUPID. STUPID.
(Mark) THAT'S FASCINATING,
DR. HAHN.

20:49.067 --> 20:53.067
WHAT?
YOU'RE AS UNKIND TO YOURSELF
AS YOU ARE TO EVERYONE ELSE.

20:53.100 --> 20:55.300
SLOAN.

20:55.333 --> 20:57.467
DR. SLOAN,
HIS ARTERY BLEW AGAIN,

20:57.500 --> 21:00.500
AND HE APPEARS TO BE HAVING
A LEFT-SIDED C.V.A.
WHERE IS HE?

21:00.533 --> 21:04.200
I--HERE. YOU TOLD ME
TO BRING HIM HERE.

21:04.233 --> 21:06.133
HAHN, ARE YOU CLOSE?
NO.

21:06.167 --> 21:09.633
YANG, GET HIM TO
A STERILE PROCEDURE ROOM. RUN!

21:09.667 --> 21:12.533
LET'S GO. THIS WAY.
OKAY, I'M DONE. I CAN HELP.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

21:12.567 --> 21:15.433
I NEED AN ANESTHESIOLOGIST, I
NEED A NURSE, I NEED EQUIPMENT.

21:15.467 --> 21:17.800
(Callie) I'M ON IT.
UH, KAREV, STAY WITH HAHN.

21:17.833 --> 21:22.533
THIS MAN HAS FOUR CHILDREN.
HE HAS FOUR CHILDREN.

21:22.567 --> 21:24.833
THIS MAN HAS FOUR CHILDREN.

21:24.867 --> 21:28.200
(emergency radio chatter)

21:28.233 --> 21:30.600
I FEEL LIKE
I'M GOING IN TOO FAR.

21:30.633 --> 21:32.300
UH, PULL BACK,
PULL BACK.

21:32.333 --> 21:34.033
PULL BACK, PULL BACK.

21:34.067 --> 21:36.267
CHIEF, WHAT AM I DOING?
YOU'RE TOO FAR IN.

21:36.300 --> 21:39.067
THERE'S SOME S.T. ELEVATION.
TRY ANGLING MORE FORWARD.

21:39.100 --> 21:39.833
(breathing erratically)

21:39.867 --> 21:42.533
YEAH.

21:42.567 --> 21:44.133
I GOT IT. I GOT IT.

21:44.167 --> 21:45.533
OH.

21:45.567 --> 21:47.600
RAY?

21:47.633 --> 21:51.200
THAT FEELS GOOD.
I CAN BREATHE.

21:51.233 --> 21:53.533
OKAY, HE'S ALMOST STABLE.
GET READY TO CUT HIM OUT.

21:53.567 --> 21:55.467
ALL RIGHT.
THAT FEELS BETTER.

21:55.500 --> 21:58.100
ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU OUTTA HERE.

21:58.133 --> 22:00.100
WE'RE GETTING YOU OUTTA HERE
RIGHT NOW.

22:00.133 --> 22:02.033
(people speaking indistinctly)

22:02.067 --> 22:04.633
OH, YOU'RE BLEEDING.
THAT'S RAY'S BLOOD.

22:04.667 --> 22:06.567
LET ME SEE THAT.

22:06.600 --> 22:09.200
(metal creaking)

22:09.233 --> 22:11.367
(man) COME ON. EVERYBODY.

22:11.400 --> 22:13.833
YOU COULD USE
A COUPLE OF STITCHES.

22:13.867 --> 22:17.200
NOW YOU STAYED CALM
AND FOCUSED AND EFFICIENT

22:17.233 --> 22:19.600
IN A VERY STRESSFUL SITUATION.

22:19.633 --> 22:22.067
THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

22:22.100 --> 22:24.233
I WAS SCARED.

22:24.267 --> 22:26.033
YOU DID IT ANYWAY.

22:26.067 --> 22:30.067
LIKE I SAID... IMPRESSIVE.

22:36.567 --> 22:39.233
DO NOT TELL ME THAT THERE
ISN'T AN O.R. AVAILABLE.

22:39.267 --> 22:41.533
THIS IS FOR
THE CHIEF OF SURGERY.

22:41.567 --> 22:44.333
THERE IS A PARAMEDIC'S LIFE
ON THE LINE.

22:44.367 --> 22:47.167
YOU NEED TO FIND ONE NOW.
I'LL SEE WHERE WE ARE.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.100
DR. STEVENS. THANK GOD.
HOW IS HE?

22:49.133 --> 22:51.033
UM, I-I BELIEVE
HE'S STILL IN SURGERY,

22:51.067 --> 22:52.833
BUT I DON'T KNOW.
YOU DON'T KNOW?

22:52.867 --> 22:54.400
WHY--WHY DON'T YOU--YOU--

22:54.433 --> 22:57.100
WELL, YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE
GONNA KEEP ME INFORMED AND--
I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

22:57.133 --> 23:00.567
I'M--I'M ON ANOTHER CASE NOW.
BUT I WAS GONNA CHECK BACK AND--
YOU'RE ON ANOTHER CASE?

23:00.600 --> 23:02.500
I'M SORRY.

23:02.533 --> 23:04.333
WELL, I-I-I HAVE
FOUR KIDS HERE.

23:04.367 --> 23:06.267
I HAVE FOUR TERRIFIED CHILDREN
WHO THINK

23:06.300 --> 23:08.200
THAT THEIR DAD'S
GONNA DIE ANY MINUTE.
I, UH--

23:08.233 --> 23:09.733
DID YOU HAVE
LOUSY INSTRUCTORS

23:09.767 --> 23:11.467
WHO DIDN'T TEACH YOU
HOW TO BE A GOOD DOCTOR,

23:11.500 --> 23:13.167
OR JUST REALLY BAD PARENTS

23:13.200 --> 23:15.233
WHO DIDN'T TEACH YOU
HOW TO BE A DECENT HUMAN BEING?

23:15.267 --> 23:17.167
(woman) STEVENS,
O.R. TWO IS CLEARING OUT NOW.

23:17.200 --> 23:19.533
THANK YOU.
UH, MY HUSBAND
IS JACOB NOLSTON,

23:19.567 --> 23:21.467
AND HE WENT
INTO SURGERY HOURS AGO.

23:21.500 --> 23:24.200
COULD YOU PLEASE JUST FIND
SOMEONE WHO CAN TELL ME

23:24.233 --> 23:26.433
WHETHER HE IS DEAD OR ALIVE?

23:26.467 --> 23:27.500
SHE SAID THAT?

23:27.533 --> 23:29.500
LOOK, IF YOU COULD JUST WAIT
A FEW MORE MINUTES,

23:29.533 --> 23:31.600
YOU GUYS COULD TALK
TO EACH OTHER BECAUSE,

23:31.633 --> 23:33.733
YOU KNOW, THINGS GET LOST
IN TRANSLATION,

23:33.767 --> 23:36.267
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THIS IS
CLEARLY NOT A WAY TO HAVE

23:36.300 --> 23:38.500
WHAT IS OBVIOUSLY A VERY,
VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION.

23:38.533 --> 23:40.433
IT IS CLEARLY
NOT VERY IMPORTANT.

23:40.467 --> 23:43.833
OUR MARRIAGE IS FALLING APART,
AND SHE SENDS YOU TO SAVE IT.

23:43.867 --> 23:45.633
TUCKER.

23:45.667 --> 23:47.800
SHE'S IN SURGERY.
SHE'S SAVING A LIFE.

23:47.833 --> 23:50.633
SHE'S LITERALLY SAVING A LIFE,
AND SHE'S GONNA BE HERE SOON.

23:50.667 --> 23:52.567
SHE'S ALWAYS SAVING
A PERSON'S LIFE.

23:52.600 --> 23:54.333
SHE'LL ALWAYS BE HERE SOON.

23:54.367 --> 23:56.267
YOU GO ASK HER,

23:56.300 --> 23:58.367
WHEN EXACTLY IS "SOON"
GONNA COME?

23:58.400 --> 24:00.167
(elevator bell dings)

24:09.667 --> 24:11.300
EXCUSE ME.

24:11.333 --> 24:12.533
YOU'RE, UM...

24:12.567 --> 24:14.633
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO CAME TO GET ME,

24:14.667 --> 24:16.533
WHO TOLD ME ABOUT STAN?

24:16.567 --> 24:18.333
YES.

24:18.367 --> 24:19.533
IS RAY, UM...

24:19.567 --> 24:21.367
HE'S IN SURGERY.

24:21.400 --> 24:23.700
OKAY. UH...

24:23.733 --> 24:25.633
I HAVE TO GO.
I HAVE TO GET--

24:25.667 --> 24:29.567
I HAVE TO
GET OUTTA HERE, SO...

24:29.600 --> 24:31.633
LOOK, CAN YOU TELL HIM
THAT, UM...

24:31.667 --> 24:34.533
THAT I'M SORRY THAT I--
THAT I CAN'T STAY HERE?

24:34.567 --> 24:37.433
BUT I JUST--I JUST CAN'T
COME BACK HERE RIGHT NOW.

24:37.467 --> 24:40.333
RAY WANTED ME TO TELL YOU
THAT HE'S SORRY, TOO.

24:40.367 --> 24:42.267
HE'S SORRY
HE COULDN'T SAVE STAN.

24:42.300 --> 24:45.167
HE WANTED ME TO TELL YOU THAT
IN CASE HE DIDN'T MAKE IT.

24:45.200 --> 24:47.200
***

24:47.233 --> 24:49.667
YOU THINK
HE'S NOT GONNA MAKE IT?

24:49.700 --> 24:51.667
I HOPE HE MAKES IT.

24:51.700 --> 24:54.600
BUT YOU WON'T BE HERE, SO...

24:54.633 --> 24:58.433
MY HUSBAND IS DEAD.

24:58.467 --> 25:03.400
HE'S DEAD...
SOMEWHERE IN THIS HOSPITAL.

25:03.433 --> 25:06.833
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO--
TO STAY HERE?

25:06.867 --> 25:09.067
***

25:09.100 --> 25:10.833
I DON'T KNOW.

25:10.867 --> 25:12.533
I DON'T KNOW.

25:12.567 --> 25:15.667
BUT I KNOW THAT
IF RAY MAKES IT,

25:15.700 --> 25:18.733
HE'S GONNA WAKE UP,
AND HE'S GONNA HAVE NO ONE.

25:18.767 --> 25:21.800
AND YOU'RE GONNA GO HOME,
AND--AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE...

25:21.833 --> 25:23.767
NO ONE.

25:23.800 --> 25:26.600
I THINK IT'S BETTER
TO HAVE SOMEONE.

25:26.633 --> 25:28.267
EVEN IF IT HURTS,

25:28.300 --> 25:31.167
EVEN IF IT'S THE MOST PAINFUL
THING YOU HAVE TO DO,

25:31.200 --> 25:33.100
EVEN IF IT'S
THE MOST PAINFUL THING

25:33.133 --> 25:35.033
YOU'VE EVER HAD TO DO,

25:35.067 --> 25:38.767
I THINK IT'S BETTER
TO HAVE SOMEONE.

25:38.800 --> 25:41.100
SEE THIS SKIN, O'MALLEY?

25:41.133 --> 25:42.533
IT LOOKS A LITTLE...

25:42.567 --> 25:44.233
JAGGED.

25:44.267 --> 25:46.367
DOES IT LOOK JAGGED
TO YOU?

25:46.400 --> 25:49.233
'CAUSE IF IT IS JAGGED,

25:49.267 --> 25:51.500
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO
REPOSITION THE INCISION

25:51.533 --> 25:54.133
SO THAT IT APPROXIMATES
MORE CORRECTLY.

25:54.167 --> 25:58.267
IF I DO THAT,
THIS MAN'S SWASTIKA TATTOO

25:58.300 --> 26:02.200
MIGHT BE UNRECOGNIZABLE.

26:03.567 --> 26:06.300
YEAH, IT'S A LITTLE JAGGED.

26:06.333 --> 26:09.733
I THOUGHT SO, TOO.

26:09.767 --> 26:12.233
HE LEFT, RIGHT?

26:12.267 --> 26:13.633
YES, HE LEFT.

FIGHT.

26:36.400 --> 26:38.300

26:38.333 --> 26:41.467
YOU WILL NOT DIE.
YOU WILL NOT DIE.

26:41.500 --> 26:43.367
YOU WILL NOT DIE.

26:43.400 --> 26:45.700
YOU WILL NOT DIE.

DON'T DO THIS, MARY.
COME ON. DON'T DO THIS.

26:57.167 --> 27:00.033
I NEED MORE LIGHT.
CAN I GET MORE LIGHT?

27:25.767 --> 27:27.800
HE LOOKS BAD.

27:27.833 --> 27:29.733
HE... HE LOOKS
REALLY BAD.

27:29.767 --> 27:32.367
WELL, HIS HEART
WAS SEVERELY DAMAGED

27:32.400 --> 27:33.833
AND HIS LUNGS WERE COMPROMISED.

27:33.867 --> 27:35.367
BUT HE'S YOUNG AND STRONG,

27:35.400 --> 27:38.533
AND OUR HOPE IS
THAT HE'LL BE JUST FINE.

27:53.233 --> 27:55.533
RAY.

27:56.333 --> 27:58.233
RAY.

28:00.233 --> 28:03.200
I'M HERE.

28:12.733 --> 28:14.633
WELL, YOUR LIVER
HAD MORE DAMAGE

28:14.667 --> 28:16.567
THAN WE SAW ON THE C.T.,

28:16.600 --> 28:19.233
AND THEN WE FOUND
A PERFORATION IN YOUR BOWEL.

28:19.267 --> 28:21.167
BUT WE TOOK CARE OF IT ALL,

28:21.200 --> 28:24.300
AND YOU SHOULD HAVE
A FULL RECOVERY.
WELL, NOT A FULL RECOVERY.

28:24.333 --> 28:26.167
DR. BAI--

28:26.200 --> 28:28.633
SHE DID THIS ON PURPOSE,
RIGHT?

28:28.667 --> 28:30.033
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

28:30.067 --> 28:31.800
UH, YOU HAVE
A BLACK PARTNER, RIGHT?

28:31.833 --> 28:33.067
YEAH.

28:33.100 --> 28:34.167
MARY?

28:34.200 --> 28:37.500
YEAH. DO YOU KNOW
HOW SHE IS?

28:37.533 --> 28:40.367
OH, YOU--
ARE YOU TWO FRIENDS?

28:40.400 --> 28:43.133
OH, LOOK,
I'M NOT THE DEVIL, OKAY?

28:43.167 --> 28:47.067
I'M JUST A GUY
WITH A BELIEF SYSTEM.

28:47.100 --> 28:49.100
MARY'S A NICE GIRL.
WE SAVE LIVES TOGETHER.

28:49.133 --> 28:50.633
THAT'S A GOOD TIME.

28:50.667 --> 28:52.567
NOW IF SHE WANTED
TO MARRY MY BROTHER,

28:52.600 --> 28:54.500
I'D HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH THAT,

28:54.533 --> 28:56.433
BUT SO WOULD
A LOT OF PEOPLE.

28:56.467 --> 28:58.133
I'M NOT THAT MUCH DIFFERENT

28:58.167 --> 29:01.567
THAN MOST OF THE PEOPLE
THAT YOU KNOW.

29:01.600 --> 29:04.700
WELL, DR. BAILEY DID
SAVE YOUR LIFE TODAY.

29:04.733 --> 29:08.067
A BLACK WOMAN SAVED YOUR LIFE
AT GREAT PERSONAL COST.

29:08.100 --> 29:10.233
SO MAYBE NEXT TIME YOU'RE
LOOKING AT YOUR TATTOO,

29:10.267 --> 29:12.167
AND YOU'RE THINKING
HOW MUCH BETTER

29:12.200 --> 29:14.633
ALL US WHITE GUYS ARE
THAN EVERYONE ELSE,

29:14.667 --> 29:15.867
YOU THINK ABOUT THAT.

29:15.900 --> 29:18.733
BECAUSE BETWEEN YOU AND ME, IF I
HAD BEEN ALONE IN THAT O.R.,

29:18.767 --> 29:21.100
YOU'D PROBABLY BE DEAD
RIGHT NOW.

29:21.133 --> 29:23.067
AND, UH, SINCE WE'RE
SHARING BELIEF SYSTEMS,

29:23.100 --> 29:24.833
I BELIEVE,
IF YOU WERE DEAD,

29:24.867 --> 29:27.500
THE WORLD WOULD BE
A BETTER PLACE.

29:37.833 --> 29:39.733
HOW'S HE DOING?

29:39.767 --> 29:42.667
OH, HE'S OKAY.
THE SURGERY WAS PRETTY HAIRY.

29:42.700 --> 29:44.567
HE BLEW A GRAFT
WHEN WE WERE CLOSING.

29:44.600 --> 29:46.433
BUT HE'S STARTING TO RALLY.

29:46.467 --> 29:47.733
GOOD. THAT'S GOOD.

29:47.767 --> 29:50.467
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

29:50.500 --> 29:52.533
I WAS JUST CHECKING--

29:52.567 --> 29:56.267
WE DID JUST FINE
WITHOUT YOUR HELP. YOU MIND?

30:10.867 --> 30:12.467
(clears throat)

30:12.500 --> 30:14.633
YOU'RE NOT HEADING HOME?

30:14.667 --> 30:17.300
JUST EASIER AT THIS POINT
TO STAY HERE

30:17.333 --> 30:20.100
TILL TUCKER'S ASLEEP.

30:21.533 --> 30:24.200
YOU KNOW,
I ROSE ABOVE, TOO, TODAY.

30:24.233 --> 30:25.700
YES, YOU DID.

30:25.733 --> 30:28.600
YOU WERE HAVING A HARD DAY,
YOU WERE BUSY RISING ABOVE,

30:28.633 --> 30:30.667
BUT SO WAS I,

30:30.700 --> 30:32.567
WHICH IS WHY
I HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING.

30:32.600 --> 30:36.233
BUT NOW THE DAY IS OVER,
AND I'M DONE.

30:36.267 --> 30:38.633
EXCUSE ME?
YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU DID,

30:38.667 --> 30:40.833
PULLING ME OFF
OF HAHN'S SURGERY,

30:40.867 --> 30:42.767
WAS AN ABUSE OF POWER.
WHAT ARE--

30:42.800 --> 30:45.033
YOU KNOW, YOU NEEDED HELP?
OKAY.

30:45.067 --> 30:47.333
BUT YOU USED ME BECAUSE OF
THE COLOR OF MY SKIN.

30:47.367 --> 30:50.167
I MEAN, YOU COMPROMISED
THE QUALITY OF MY EDUCATION

30:50.200 --> 30:51.700
BECAUSE OF MY COLOR.

30:51.733 --> 30:54.033
I RESENT IT.

30:55.533 --> 30:58.467
(mutters)

30:58.500 --> 31:00.400
(sighs)

31:00.433 --> 31:03.300
(water runs)

31:03.333 --> 31:05.100
(stops)

31:07.067 --> 31:08.533
YOU SAVED HER LIFE.

31:08.567 --> 31:11.233
NO, I FIXED HER BRAIN,
RESTORED HER MOTOR SKILLS

31:11.267 --> 31:13.400
AND DID A HIGHLY STRESSFUL,
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT PROCEDURE.

31:13.433 --> 31:17.133
BUT, NO, NO,
YOU SAVED HER LIFE.

31:44.267 --> 31:45.733
OKAY.

31:45.767 --> 31:49.067
THANKS. THAT WAS...

31:49.100 --> 31:50.700
OKAY.

31:50.733 --> 31:52.633
YOUR VOICE IS SHAKING.

31:52.667 --> 31:54.667
I'M AN IMPERFECT PERSON.

32:10.433 --> 32:12.100
ARE HIS PARENTS COMING?

32:12.133 --> 32:14.133
THEY'RE ON A PLANE
FROM CALIFORNIA.

32:14.167 --> 32:16.467
YOU GONNA WAIT?

32:16.500 --> 32:18.600
YEAH, I'M GONNA WAIT.

32:37.600 --> 32:38.533
(inhales)

32:38.567 --> 32:39.400
HEY.

32:39.433 --> 32:41.267
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO DATE OTHER PEOPLE.

32:41.300 --> 32:44.400
IT MAY NOT BE ENOUGH FOR YOU,
BUT I'M TRYING HERE.

32:44.433 --> 32:48.500
SO I DON'T WANT YOU TO DATE
ANYBODY BUT ME. THAT'S IT.

32:52.267 --> 32:53.733
EXCEPT...

32:53.767 --> 32:56.833
I'M SCARED AS HELL
TO WANT YOU.

32:56.867 --> 32:59.633
BUT HERE I AM,
WANTING YOU ANYWAY.

32:59.667 --> 33:03.800
AND FEAR MEANS I HAVE
SOMETHING TO LOSE, RIGHT?

33:03.833 --> 33:07.500
AND I DON'T WANT
TO LOSE YOU.

33:09.700 --> 33:11.233
MEREDITH--

33:11.267 --> 33:14.067
DON'T.
DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

33:14.100 --> 33:15.267
I'M GONNA LEAVE,

33:15.300 --> 33:18.033
AND YOU CAN
SAY SOMETHING TOMORROW.

33:18.067 --> 33:20.400
THAT'S PROGRESS, RIGHT?

33:31.567 --> 33:34.233
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

33:34.267 --> 33:37.133
ARE YOU--ARE YOU--
ARE YOU REALLY OKAY?

33:37.167 --> 33:39.033
YEAH. YEAH.

33:39.067 --> 33:40.400
NO, ALEX, COME ON.

33:40.433 --> 33:42.533
THAT WAS INTENSE--

33:42.567 --> 33:44.633
INTENSE AND CRAZY
AND JUST AWFUL.

33:44.667 --> 33:48.067
H-HOW CAN YOU BE OKAY
AFTER A DAY LIKE THAT?

33:48.100 --> 33:50.500
UH, ALEX. ALEX.

33:50.533 --> 33:53.633
WHY WON'T YOU TALK TO ME?

33:53.667 --> 33:56.333
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO TALK ABOUT, REBECCA?

33:56.367 --> 33:59.233
HOW A GUY ALMOST BLED OUT
WHILE I WATCHED,

33:59.267 --> 34:02.133
OR HOW I GOT SUSPENDED FOR
A WEEK 'CAUSE YOU WERE THERE?

34:02.167 --> 34:03.367
AVA. IT'S AVA,
NOT REBECCA.

34:03.400 --> 34:05.200
RIGHT.
YOU'RE PLAYING DRESS UP.

34:05.233 --> 34:07.133
YOU'RE HERE
PLAYING DRESS UP.

34:07.167 --> 34:08.733
YOU HAVE A HUSBAND,
REBECCA.

34:08.767 --> 34:10.667
YOU HAVE A BABY,
AND I HAVE A LIFE.

34:10.700 --> 34:12.600
THAT GIRL YOU WERE
TALKING TO EARLIER TODAY

34:12.633 --> 34:14.833
WHEN YOU WERE PLAYING
MED STUDENT? I'M SCREWING HER.

34:14.867 --> 34:17.367
AND SHE MIGHT BE
A BIGGER WRECK THAN I AM,

34:17.400 --> 34:19.300
BUT AT LEAST
SHE'S NOT MARRIED,

34:19.333 --> 34:21.233
AT LEAST SHE'S NOT GONNA
GET ME SUSPENDED,

34:21.267 --> 34:23.467
AT LEAST SHE'S--SHE'S NOT
TRYING TO PRETEND

34:23.500 --> 34:25.267
TO BE SOMEBODY SHE'S NOT.
ALEX--

34:25.300 --> 34:27.733
NO, YOU GOTTA ASK YOURSELF
WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE.

34:27.767 --> 34:29.667
'CAUSE I THINK
IF YOU COULD GET HONEST,

34:29.700 --> 34:32.067
IF YOU COULD JUST TELL
THE DAMN TRUTH FOR ONE MINUTE,

34:32.100 --> 34:35.100
I THINK YOU HAVE TO ADMIT
YOU'RE NOT HERE TO TALK.

34:46.200 --> 34:48.433
(door opens)

34:58.867 --> 35:01.733
YOU DID A GOOD JOB TODAY,
AND IT WAS NOT EASY.

35:01.767 --> 35:05.100
WHAT YOU DID WAS NOT EASY.

35:05.133 --> 35:08.133
IT WAS BRAVE.

35:09.233 --> 35:11.700
WE KILLED HIM.

35:11.733 --> 35:15.100
THE HOSPITAL...

35:17.067 --> 35:19.767
SLOAN, US...

35:21.467 --> 35:24.600
WE WERE NOT PREPARED.

35:27.500 --> 35:30.333
YEAH.

35:30.367 --> 35:32.567
YEAH,
THAT HAPPENS SOMETIMES.

35:32.600 --> 35:35.200
THAT'S...

35:36.367 --> 35:40.467
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW BACKWARDS THAT IS?

35:40.500 --> 35:43.233
WE HELP MORE THAN WE HURT.

35:49.700 --> 35:52.500
I HAVE NO ONE.

36:14.533 --> 36:17.300
(clears throat)

36:17.333 --> 36:20.167
THIS IS
GONNA SOUND BIZARRE.

36:20.200 --> 36:22.100
I REALIZE AT THIS POINT

36:22.133 --> 36:25.733
THAT THIS IS
GONNA SOUND BIZARRE, BUT...

36:25.767 --> 36:28.733
ANY CHANCE YOU PEOPLE
WANT TO GET A DRINK WITH ME?

36:28.767 --> 36:30.667
WHY WOULD WE WANT
TO DO THAT?

36:30.700 --> 36:33.267
SHE'S SAYING
SHE NEEDS A FRIEND.

36:33.300 --> 36:35.600
OKAY. FINE.
LET'S DRINK.

36:35.633 --> 36:37.733
YOU WON'T HIT ON ME?
I CAN'T PROMISE THAT.

36:37.767 --> 36:41.467
IF I SAY PLEASE?
HE STILL CAN'T PROMISE THAT.

36:44.167 --> 36:46.033
FINE.

36:46.067 --> 36:49.300
***

36:54.867 --> 36:57.333
(door opens)

36:57.367 --> 36:59.567
HEY, I BROUGHT SUPPLIES.

***

37:07.833 --> 37:09.267
(door closes)

37:09.300 --> 37:12.600
***

37:12.633 --> 37:15.167
SOME DAYS, THE WHOLE WORLD
SEEMS UPSIDE DOWN.

37:15.200 --> 37:19.033
SHE'S GOT NO ONE.

37:19.067 --> 37:20.567
(sighs)

37:20.600 --> 37:23.733
***

37:30.500 --> 37:32.167
(sighs)

37:32.200 --> 37:34.033
I'M DRINKING.

37:34.067 --> 37:36.767
ARE YOU DRINKING, LEXIE?

37:36.800 --> 37:40.433
YEAH,
A DRINK WOULD BE GOOD.

37:40.467 --> 37:43.133

37:44.833 --> 37:46.733

(door closes)

37:54.867 --> 37:57.233
HEY.

37:57.267 --> 38:00.767
I WAS HAHN'S
RIGHT HAND TODAY.

38:00.800 --> 38:02.700
***

38:02.733 --> 38:04.633
THAT'S--
THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?

38:04.667 --> 38:06.567
THAT'S GREAT.

38:06.600 --> 38:08.467
***

38:08.500 --> 38:10.400
I THINK
A PATIENT FEELS BETTER

38:10.433 --> 38:12.567
IF THEY KNOW
THEIR KIDS AREN'T TERRIFIED.

38:12.600 --> 38:15.467
I THINK THEY'RE MORE LIKELY
TO PULL THROUGH SURGERY

38:15.500 --> 38:18.133
IF THEY KNOW THAT
THEIR WIVES ARE NOT PANICKED.

38:18.167 --> 38:19.333
I THINK THOSE THINGS MATTER.

38:19.367 --> 38:21.033
WELL, THEY DO MATTER.

38:21.067 --> 38:23.600
I'M NEVER GONNA BE CRISTINA.

38:23.633 --> 38:25.533
IT'S JUST NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

38:25.567 --> 38:27.733
AND I AM NEVER GONNA BE
ERICA HAHN.

38:27.767 --> 38:31.633
I AM NOT... KICK-ASS.

38:31.667 --> 38:33.567
THANK GOD FOR THAT.

38:33.600 --> 38:37.500
***

38:43.100 --> 38:45.500
I LOVE YOU.

I LOVE YOU.

38:49.767 --> 38:52.633

38:52.667 --> 38:55.467
WE'RE NOT GONNA
MAKE THIS WORK, ARE WE?

38:55.500 --> 38:58.433
***

38:58.467 --> 38:59.633
MARRIAGE IS HARD.

38:59.667 --> 39:01.567
I MEAN,
EVEN WHEN IT'S RIGHT...

39:01.600 --> 39:06.633
IT'S HARD, AND...

39:08.233 --> 39:11.700
NEXT TIME I DO IT,
I JUST WANT IT TO BE FOREVER.

39:19.233 --> 39:22.367
I THINK IT'S OUR TIMING.

39:22.400 --> 39:24.467

39:24.500 --> 39:27.800

MAYBE SOMEDAY?

39:32.667 --> 39:35.800

39:35.833 --> 39:39.767
YEAH, YEAH,
WE'RE SAYING MAYBE SOMEDAY.
