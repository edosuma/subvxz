00:01.335 --> 00:03.304
NARRATOR: Tonight on
The Curse of Oak Island,

00:03.337 --> 00:05.139
a special season finale.

00:05.173 --> 00:06.640
GARY:
I took the gem

00:06.674 --> 00:09.077
to a gemologist.

00:09.110 --> 00:12.480
It's a 500-year-old stone.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.548
-Get him in the water.
-Eyes and boots.

00:14.582 --> 00:16.050
Yes!

00:16.084 --> 00:17.051
RICK:
What is down there,

00:17.085 --> 00:18.052
and can we get it out?

00:19.587 --> 00:20.721
They found something, Rick.

00:20.754 --> 00:22.656
Oak Island is for real.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.392
A lot of this
looks spendable, David.

00:24.425 --> 00:26.394
-I say we celebrate.

00:26.427 --> 00:27.795
There's treasure on Oak Island.

00:27.828 --> 00:28.729
JACK:
Yeah!

00:31.432 --> 00:34.468
NARRATOR: There is an island
in the North Atlantic

00:34.502 --> 00:38.206
where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure

00:38.239 --> 00:41.175
for more than 200 years.

00:41.209 --> 00:44.578
So far, they have found
a stone slab

00:44.612 --> 00:47.548
with strange symbols
carved into it,

00:47.581 --> 00:50.418
mysterious fragments
of human bone,

00:50.451 --> 00:54.422
and a lead cross,
whose origin may stretch back

00:54.455 --> 00:56.690
to the days
of the Knights Templar.

00:56.724 --> 01:02.430
To date, six men have died
trying to solve the mystery.

01:02.463 --> 01:07.501
And, according to legend,
one more will have to die

01:07.535 --> 01:10.771
before the treasure
can be found.

01:21.249 --> 01:23.684
With only a few days remaining

01:23.717 --> 01:26.787
before they must shut down
operations for the year...

01:26.820 --> 01:29.790
RICK: So, this is
an important war room meeting.

01:29.823 --> 01:32.560
NARRATOR: ...brothers
Rick and Marty Lagina

01:32.593 --> 01:34.495
have called a meeting
in the war room.

01:34.528 --> 01:36.597
They are eager to follow up on

01:36.630 --> 01:39.700
what could be one of
the most incredible discoveries

01:39.733 --> 01:44.405
in the 223-year-old search
for treasure on Oak Island.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.340
I think, Alex,
we need to dial up

01:46.374 --> 01:49.109
-your father and Craig.
-All right, I'll get them up.

01:51.345 --> 01:52.446
Hey, guys.

01:52.480 --> 01:53.514
-Hey, guys.
-Hey, Marty.

01:53.547 --> 01:55.416
-Hey.
-Hello.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.851
You know of the find
that Gary made,

01:57.885 --> 02:00.454
regarding the brooch
and the jewel.

02:00.488 --> 02:02.256
-Yes. -Yes.
-RICK: Okay.

02:05.526 --> 02:08.396
GARY: That was weird.
Look at this, Rick.

02:08.429 --> 02:10.331
We've got it.

02:10.364 --> 02:12.900
NARRATOR: Two days ago,
while searching on Lot 8

02:12.933 --> 02:15.503
located near the middle
of the island,

02:15.536 --> 02:18.839
Rick Lagina and metal detection
expert Gary Drayton

02:18.872 --> 02:20.808
discovered a curious object.

02:20.841 --> 02:23.911
-Look at that.
-Oh, man.

02:23.944 --> 02:25.679
NARRATOR:
Upon further investigation,

02:25.713 --> 02:28.382
it appeared they had found
an antique brooch,

02:28.416 --> 02:32.220
a brooch which featured
a large, deep red stone.

02:32.253 --> 02:33.821
Rick, we just found a jewel.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.489
That's gorgeous.

02:35.523 --> 02:37.491
Look at how many facets on that.

02:37.525 --> 02:40.494
GARY:
That is a bobby dazzler.

02:40.528 --> 02:42.896
Right, you're all sitting down,

02:42.930 --> 02:44.498
-which is good 'cause you're...

02:44.532 --> 02:45.866
you're in for a shock.

02:45.899 --> 02:49.237
I took the gem-- jewel--

02:49.270 --> 02:52.806
to a certified gemologist

02:52.840 --> 02:54.975
in Halifax

02:55.008 --> 02:58.212
and basically asked
what the stone was,

02:58.246 --> 03:00.614
'cause we was all thinking ruby.

03:00.648 --> 03:03.917
But the bad news is
it's not a ruby.

03:03.951 --> 03:08.222
But the good news is
it's a rhodolite garnet.

03:11.592 --> 03:16.664
It's a 400-
or 500-year-old stone.

03:20.934 --> 03:22.770
400 to 500 years ago

03:22.803 --> 03:26.340
-puts us into the 1500s
to 1600s. -Yep.

03:26.374 --> 03:29.610
And that's before
any searchers, too.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.479
-Yeah.
-That dates back to being

03:31.512 --> 03:33.847
-probably from
the original depositors. -Yeah.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.917
-The right era we want to be in.
-Yeah.

03:36.950 --> 03:39.720
It's a rhodolite garnet.

03:41.889 --> 03:45.926
NARRATOR: A rhodolite garnet
is a semiprecious gemstone

03:45.959 --> 03:49.397
known for its rose pink
to deep red coloring.

03:49.430 --> 03:52.733
Its use in jewelry
dates all the way back

03:52.766 --> 03:55.403
to the days
of the Egyptian pharaohs,

03:55.436 --> 03:57.371
who used them
for both decorative

03:57.405 --> 03:59.973
and ceremonial purposes.

04:00.007 --> 04:05.746
But how did such a unique stone
come to be found on Oak Island?

04:05.779 --> 04:09.550
Could it be a piece of
some kind of pirate treasure

04:09.583 --> 04:11.685
or one of the legendary
lost jewels

04:11.719 --> 04:14.522
of Queen Marie Antoinette?

04:14.555 --> 04:16.657
Honestly, I was shocked.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.058
I was shocked when Gary said,

04:18.091 --> 04:20.928
"Hey, that-that not only
is not glass,

04:20.961 --> 04:23.531
"it is at least
a semiprecious stone.

04:23.564 --> 04:26.334
And it could be very old."

04:26.367 --> 04:28.669
I'm not totally shocked,

04:28.702 --> 04:31.639
but again, it's that number.

04:31.672 --> 04:33.674
400 to 500 years old, possibly.

04:33.707 --> 04:35.676
That's-that's a huge number.

04:35.709 --> 04:38.078
And, uh, that's surprising.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.447
MARTY:
How does he date that?

04:39.480 --> 04:41.482
How do you date a stone?

04:41.515 --> 04:45.753
His opinion was
it was a really old cut.

04:45.786 --> 04:48.489
Because remember
when we turned it over

04:48.522 --> 04:52.326
-and you could see
the facets on it? -Yes, I...

04:52.360 --> 04:53.994
Well, well, these were hand-cut.

04:54.027 --> 04:57.365
These weren't maine-made,

04:57.398 --> 04:58.966
and these were done
before the days

04:58.999 --> 05:01.869
when people thought
about refraction

05:01.902 --> 05:03.904
and light
going through the stones.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.906
You know, where they used to do

05:05.939 --> 05:09.009
all the fancy cuts,
more modern cuts.

05:09.042 --> 05:11.845
This is a hand-cut gem.

05:11.879 --> 05:14.482
-GARY: Yep. -Wow.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.016
-There's one other thing.
-GARY: Yep.

05:16.049 --> 05:18.652
It is a silver setting.

05:18.686 --> 05:22.856
When people made silver jewelry
long ago,

05:22.890 --> 05:25.993
it had an high percentage
of copper in the mix,

05:26.026 --> 05:28.396
up to 73%.

05:28.429 --> 05:31.799
And there wouldn't be
that amount of copper

05:31.832 --> 05:34.435
in a modern silver jewelry mix.

05:34.468 --> 05:36.670
-Yeah.
-And this copper color

05:36.704 --> 05:39.540
is the copper leaching out.

05:39.573 --> 05:41.942
-Oxidizing.
-GARY: Yeah, out of the silver.

05:41.975 --> 05:44.545
And that's how
he was able to tell

05:44.578 --> 05:48.382
that it was really old,
because of the patina on it.

05:48.416 --> 05:50.784
-Wow. -Well, I'll pass
the gemstone around.

05:50.818 --> 05:53.521
Look at that, Charles.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.856
MARTY: David, I think,
I think you might be looking

05:55.889 --> 05:57.057
at a spendable right there.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.659
Yeah, I think so, too.

05:58.692 --> 06:02.162
Gemstones on Oak Island. Yeah!

06:03.664 --> 06:05.633
-Yeah, baby!

06:05.666 --> 06:07.868
Yeah, baby.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.803
We-we got to figure out
what it means

06:09.837 --> 06:11.905
and bring it to the next expert
and all that.

06:11.939 --> 06:15.509
I'm gonna do a little research
on rhodolite garnet.

06:15.543 --> 06:17.945
I imagine
400 or 500 years ago,

06:17.978 --> 06:19.847
there might only be
a certain amount of places

06:19.880 --> 06:21.749
where such a gem
would come from.

06:21.782 --> 06:22.850
-CRAIG: Yeah.
-Yeah, that's a...

06:22.883 --> 06:24.985
You know, so that's great stuff.

06:25.018 --> 06:26.153
Yeah.

06:26.186 --> 06:27.555
MARTY:
Amazing.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.423
A very significant find.

06:29.457 --> 06:31.859
I'm-I'm very surprised.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.994
The stone apparently is real

06:34.027 --> 06:36.497
with a, with a cut
that has not been used

06:36.530 --> 06:38.832
for a long, long time.

06:38.866 --> 06:40.568
I mean,
it certainly is a "wow" find,

06:40.601 --> 06:41.835
but what does it mean?

06:41.869 --> 06:44.004
Okay, well, we'll move on, then.

06:44.037 --> 06:45.706
Good stuff. Good stuff.

06:45.739 --> 06:46.874
Carry on.
-RICK: All right.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.442
-See you. -See you later.
-See you later.

06:48.476 --> 06:49.477
Bye, guys.

06:56.684 --> 06:59.853
NARRATOR: One day after
learning from Gary Drayton

06:59.887 --> 07:02.523
that the deep red stone
they discovered

07:02.556 --> 07:06.727
could be a genuine piece
of centuries-old jewelry,

07:06.760 --> 07:10.130
Rick Lagina and members
of the Oak Island team

07:10.163 --> 07:12.032
arrive at the Money Pit site

07:12.065 --> 07:15.035
to meet with diver Mike Huntley
and his crew.

07:15.068 --> 07:17.605
I'm just gonna spin the bow
of the van around

07:17.638 --> 07:19.206
so we can see this can here.

07:19.239 --> 07:20.941
NARRATOR:
Mike has been invited

07:20.974 --> 07:24.111
to dive the 60-inch-wide
exploratory shaft

07:24.144 --> 07:26.880
known as D.M.T.

07:26.914 --> 07:30.551
If successful, he may be able
to determine the exact nature

07:30.584 --> 07:32.686
of what is believed to be
a large object

07:32.720 --> 07:35.055
that has been blocking
the team's efforts

07:35.088 --> 07:37.691
to continue digging
at the site.

07:37.725 --> 07:39.527
ALEX:
Here's Rick.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.861
-Hey, Rick.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.195
We're debating and we're hoping.

07:42.229 --> 07:45.032
In the near term,
we're gonna get real answers

07:45.065 --> 07:47.668
from a very significant
question--

07:47.701 --> 07:51.204
i.e. what is down there,
and can we get it out?

07:51.238 --> 07:53.641
There's an obstruction there.

07:53.674 --> 07:55.509
We're good to go, guys.

07:55.543 --> 07:57.545
NARRATOR:
Several weeks ago,

07:57.578 --> 07:59.279
the Oak Island team
began digging

07:59.312 --> 08:01.882
their second 60-inch-wide shaft
of the year,

08:01.915 --> 08:04.585
which they had named D.M.T.

08:04.618 --> 08:08.188
in honor of Craig Tester's
late son, Drake.

08:08.221 --> 08:11.124
They were trying to locate
the Chappell Vault,

08:11.158 --> 08:14.027
the mysterious
seven-foot-tall wooden box

08:14.061 --> 08:16.263
that treasure hunters
William Chappell

08:16.296 --> 08:20.934
and Frederick Blair
first discovered in 1897.

08:20.968 --> 08:24.838
Although the team is convinced
that their first shaft, H-8,

08:24.872 --> 08:27.741
was successful in reaching it
several weeks ago,

08:27.775 --> 08:29.843
they believe
it may have been pushed aside

08:29.877 --> 08:31.979
by the drilling caisson.

08:32.012 --> 08:35.549
Unfortunately, two weeks ago,

08:35.583 --> 08:38.218
while the team was drilling
the D.M.T. shaft,

08:38.251 --> 08:40.854
their drilling caisson
encountered an obstruction

08:40.888 --> 08:42.956
at a depth of 77 feet.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.558
(rapid mechanical clicking,
thump)

08:47.895 --> 08:48.896
DANNY:
It's strong enough to slow

08:48.929 --> 08:51.565
that thing down on a free fall.
That's crazy.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.736
And I think it's a plate
that we've encountered,

08:55.769 --> 08:58.205
and it's not searcher.

08:58.238 --> 09:00.107
It's most likely
from the original people,

09:00.140 --> 09:03.777
'cause it seems inconceivable
that searchers would have put

09:03.811 --> 09:06.179
such a big piece of metal
down there.

09:06.213 --> 09:09.983
DOUG: I mean,
it's an unexplained anomaly...

09:10.017 --> 09:11.985
at a depth
we didn't expect to hit it at.

09:12.019 --> 09:13.687
-Yeah. -So you got to wonder
what's there

09:13.721 --> 09:15.022
that's exerting that pressure.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.057
JACK: What do we do
if it's a plate, Rick?

09:17.090 --> 09:18.959
RICK:
That I don't know, Jack.

09:18.992 --> 09:22.663
For me, it's just...
I'm not gonna multitask.

09:22.696 --> 09:24.264
We know that that doesn't work.

09:24.297 --> 09:25.999
He'll make
an initial assessment,

09:26.033 --> 09:28.936
and that's as far as I care
to go on the first dive.

09:28.969 --> 09:31.705
And then I think we have
to come up and then decide.

09:31.739 --> 09:33.974
I mean, we put flocculant
in the hole.

09:34.007 --> 09:37.611
It's fairly fast-acting.
Should get a really good look.

09:37.645 --> 09:39.246
NARRATOR:
In order to provide

09:39.279 --> 09:42.783
the best visibility possible
for the dive operation,

09:42.816 --> 09:46.153
Rick and the team have already
treated the D.M.T. shaft

09:46.186 --> 09:49.857
with a substance
known as flocculant,

09:49.890 --> 09:53.761
a chemical that causes
particles or small debris

09:53.794 --> 09:56.296
that could be floating in water
to clump together

09:56.329 --> 09:59.767
and settle at the bottom
of their environment.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.769
If it turns out to be a plate

10:01.802 --> 10:04.071
and he can get around
the edge of it,

10:04.104 --> 10:07.207
he could probably explore
a little bit under the plate.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.242
You know, it might not even be
a steel plate.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.744
It could be a box.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.683
That'd be something,
if he put his hands down

10:15.716 --> 10:17.284
along the edge
and it went down deeper

10:17.317 --> 10:19.386
-than what he could get around
the edge of. -Exactly. Exactly.

10:19.419 --> 10:21.021
-Yeah.
-There's something down there.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.664
NARRATOR: Having invited
professional diver Mike Huntley

10:30.698 --> 10:32.265
and his crew to Oak Island,

10:32.299 --> 10:35.068
Rick Lagina
is hoping to find out

10:35.102 --> 10:37.137
the exact nature
of the obstruction

10:37.170 --> 10:39.807
that lies at the bottom
of the exploratory drill shaft

10:39.840 --> 10:41.942
known as D.M.T.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.977
RICK:
We're all very interested

10:44.011 --> 10:46.279
in what may be down
in this hole.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.949
You know,
steel plate at that depth?

10:48.982 --> 10:52.019
That didn't grow
down there, so...

10:52.052 --> 10:54.121
steel plate would indicate
something of value

10:54.154 --> 10:55.188
might be below it.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.124
DOUG:
Hey, Mike.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.693
You gonna give us
some answers today?

10:59.727 --> 11:01.128
Good to see you, man.

11:01.161 --> 11:04.197
Okay, guys, come on over.

11:06.099 --> 11:09.002
Okay, guys, we're gonna start
with our first dive for today.

11:09.036 --> 11:10.704
For the most part, it's
gonna be an investigative dive

11:10.738 --> 11:12.105
to see what's actually there.

11:12.139 --> 11:14.241
It's 50 feet of water, so we got

11:14.274 --> 11:17.010
about 75 minutes
without doing decompression.

11:17.044 --> 11:18.712
There's no risk
of decompression illness

11:18.746 --> 11:20.147
or any type of embolism.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.049
NARRATOR:
Although the shallow depths

11:22.082 --> 11:24.752
will not put Mike Huntley
and his team at risk

11:24.785 --> 11:26.754
of deadly
decompression sickness--

11:26.787 --> 11:29.489
otherwise known as the bends--

11:29.522 --> 11:31.491
the Oak Island team

11:31.524 --> 11:34.094
has nevertheless arranged
for paramedics to be on site

11:34.127 --> 11:38.365
in case of any unforeseen
accidents or emergencies.

11:38.398 --> 11:41.034
-Let's get wet.
-Let's get wet. Awesome.

11:41.068 --> 11:42.936
RICK:
The dive's about to begin,

11:42.970 --> 11:44.171
and I'm-I'm always nervous.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.740
Every dive is dangerous,

11:46.774 --> 11:48.241
or potentially dangerous.

11:48.275 --> 11:50.377
Shallow water dives are
the most dangerous,

11:50.410 --> 11:53.280
because you tend
to take things for granted.

11:53.313 --> 11:56.750
So... everyone's head
needs to stay in the game.

11:58.518 --> 12:01.054
I hear you loud and clear.

12:01.088 --> 12:02.389
Eyes and boots.

12:02.422 --> 12:05.392
-Eyes, boots and suits.
-Eyes, boots and suits.

12:05.425 --> 12:08.395
NARRATOR:
Throughout the dive operation,

12:08.428 --> 12:12.099
Rick Lagina and the team
will be able to maintain

12:12.132 --> 12:14.034
constant audio contact
with Mike,

12:14.067 --> 12:16.203
as well as monitor
a live video feed

12:16.236 --> 12:20.373
of his activity
in the communications trailer.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.509
-Main air is on.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.978
He's good to go!

12:25.012 --> 12:26.113
Hey, Craig.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.216
Good, good.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.383
NARRATOR:
Although Rick's brother Marty

12:30.417 --> 12:32.252
is currently away on business,

12:32.285 --> 12:35.322
their friend and partner,
Craig Tester,

12:35.355 --> 12:37.257
is monitoring today's dive

12:37.290 --> 12:40.027
from his office
in Traverse City, Michigan.

12:40.060 --> 12:42.529
We're a few minutes away from...

12:42.562 --> 12:44.397
getting Mike down hole.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.867
75 minutes, bottom time.

12:55.575 --> 12:58.278
Get him in the water!

12:58.311 --> 13:03.851
To ensure a safe descent down
the approximately 27 feet to

13:03.884 --> 13:06.820
the water in the D.M.T. shaft,
Mike Huntley will be lowered

13:06.854 --> 13:09.890
with a device
known as a bosun's chair.

13:09.923 --> 13:13.226
From there,
he will dive down some 50 feet

13:13.260 --> 13:15.428
to investigate the obstruction

13:15.462 --> 13:18.866
at a depth
of approximately 77 feet.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.806
Faster. Go down faster.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.251
MAX:
All stop.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.259
Roger that.

13:49.229 --> 13:51.932
Roger. Keep his hose tight!

14:01.408 --> 14:03.610
NARRATOR:
Because the flocculent

14:03.643 --> 14:07.080
that was poured earlier
into the D.M.T. shaft

14:07.114 --> 14:09.416
has not been able to clear up
the large amount

14:09.449 --> 14:12.585
of clay sediment and silt
that still clouds the water,

14:12.619 --> 14:15.622
visibility is near zero.

14:21.294 --> 14:23.430
We've lost
all visibility, Craig.

14:27.400 --> 14:31.038
Mike will now have
to try and determine the nature

14:31.071 --> 14:33.640
of the obstruction
with only his sense of touch.

14:37.978 --> 14:39.179
What did he say?
Super...?

15:15.515 --> 15:17.550
NARRATOR:
While attempting to dive

15:17.584 --> 15:21.254
some 77 feet deep
in the D.M.T. shaft,

15:21.288 --> 15:25.225
diver Mike Huntley has
encountered an unusual problem.

15:30.163 --> 15:31.664
MAX:
Almost like spongy?

15:43.310 --> 15:45.712
Is there a flocculent
in there already?

15:45.745 --> 15:49.116
He can't...
can't stay on bottom.

15:49.149 --> 15:51.118
The flocc would make a slurry.

15:51.151 --> 15:52.986
ALEX:
Change in buoyancy?

15:53.020 --> 15:56.056
Unfortunately, the flocculent

15:56.089 --> 15:58.091
that the team poured
down the D.M.T. shaft

15:58.125 --> 16:01.361
to aid Mike Huntley's
visibility has not only failed

16:01.394 --> 16:04.297
to clear up the water,
but is now causing him

16:04.331 --> 16:05.999
to float upward.

16:06.033 --> 16:07.767
The flocculent has reacted

16:07.800 --> 16:10.770
with the debris at the bottom
of the D.M.T. shaft

16:10.803 --> 16:13.306
and created a thick cloud
of a gel-like substance

16:13.340 --> 16:17.244
that Mike is unable
to sink through.

16:17.277 --> 16:20.180
RICK: We introduced
a lot of flocculent.

16:20.213 --> 16:21.648
Unfortunately,
now that's counterproductive

16:21.681 --> 16:23.350
to what we want to do.

16:28.555 --> 16:30.523
RICK:
Let's see...

16:30.557 --> 16:33.460
let's see if he can address
this situation with weights.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.628
He's not able
to stand on bottom.

16:35.662 --> 16:38.565
And if he's not able
to stand on bottom,

16:38.598 --> 16:42.035
because it is a tactile dive,
he's not gonna be able to feel

16:42.069 --> 16:44.637
you know, what
this obstruction might be.

16:44.671 --> 16:47.307
Okay. Roger.
Sending down the chair.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.276
Craig, he's coming
out of the hole,

16:49.309 --> 16:51.111
'cause he just can't get
to bottom.

16:51.144 --> 16:53.380
Up on chair, up on umbilical!
He's coming out!

16:53.413 --> 16:54.781
Just make sure
it's going down slow

16:54.814 --> 16:56.749
so it doesn't hit him
on top of the head.

16:58.718 --> 17:00.620
-Flocculent. No. -I never,
never anticipated this.

17:00.653 --> 17:02.055
RICK:
Mike's been here before,

17:02.089 --> 17:04.357
he's invested in the process,

17:04.391 --> 17:06.726
he's committed,
and he wants answers.

17:06.759 --> 17:08.328
I think we're in

17:08.361 --> 17:11.198
an area that has significant...

17:11.231 --> 17:13.366
potential for discovery.

17:25.345 --> 17:26.446
Roger.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.681
There you go.

17:28.715 --> 17:31.618
Okay, I need some  weight
in this thing.

17:31.651 --> 17:33.453
Holy .

17:33.486 --> 17:35.488
NARRATOR:
Mike Huntley's dive team

17:35.522 --> 17:39.192
will now pack his dive suit
with 60 pounds of lead weights

17:39.226 --> 17:43.363
to ensure his ability to reach
the bottom of the D.M.T. shaft

17:43.396 --> 17:46.699
and to identify
what the obstruction

17:46.733 --> 17:50.503
which is preventing
further excavation actually is.

17:50.537 --> 17:52.505
I did a complete 360
with my feet.

17:52.539 --> 17:54.641
I haven't felt anything yet.
On bottom.

17:54.674 --> 17:57.310
That's when I'm thinking,
"Where the hell is it?"

17:57.344 --> 17:59.212
But I can feel hard bottom,
that's the thing.

17:59.246 --> 18:02.182
I can feel it. Like, boom,
boom, boom, just like that.

18:02.215 --> 18:03.416
RICK:
I mean, there's so much

18:03.450 --> 18:05.585
unknown about
the Money Pit area.

18:05.618 --> 18:08.455
We just simply need to know,
what is this thing?

18:21.234 --> 18:22.669
Roger. All stop!

18:25.738 --> 18:27.674
Roger that.

18:29.376 --> 18:30.610
MAX:
Roger that.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.483
MAX: Yeah, we can't see
a whole lot up here.

18:45.358 --> 18:46.893
TONY:
How much flocc

18:46.926 --> 18:49.629
-I don't know, exactly.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.664
But enough to grab
all the heavy stuff

18:51.698 --> 18:53.300
and bring it down.

18:59.539 --> 19:01.941
Perfect.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.444
NARRATOR: Now that Mike
has reached the bottom,

19:04.477 --> 19:07.480
some 77 feet deep
in the D.M.T. shaft,

19:07.514 --> 19:10.250
he will begin
a tactile examination

19:10.283 --> 19:14.621
to try to determine for sure
what the obstruction is.

19:18.558 --> 19:20.560
You want me to get Jack?

19:20.593 --> 19:23.630
Jack! Jack!

19:23.663 --> 19:24.764
-They're getting him.
-Jack!

19:24.797 --> 19:25.798
JACK:
Yeah?

19:28.868 --> 19:31.271
Yes!

19:31.304 --> 19:34.641
So, are you saying that
preemptively,

19:34.674 --> 19:36.443
you're thinking
that it's a plate?

19:38.411 --> 19:40.447
-Oh, man!

19:43.616 --> 19:45.652
NARRATOR:
Could the obstruction

19:45.685 --> 19:49.389
really be a steel plate,
as Mike Huntley suggests?

19:49.422 --> 19:51.658
And if so,
what is it protecting?

19:51.691 --> 19:54.227
RICK:
When he gives an opinion

19:54.261 --> 19:55.928
that we are indeed
on a metal plate,

19:55.962 --> 19:57.864
I mean, that's-that's
an aha moment.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.832
Really? A metal plate
at this depth?

19:59.866 --> 20:01.901
Again,
from a historical context,

20:01.934 --> 20:04.271
there should not be
a metal plate there,

20:04.304 --> 20:06.473
as part of searcher agenda.

20:06.506 --> 20:10.009
So, if it's not searcher,
it's original.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.279
How deep is it?

20:12.312 --> 20:15.515
How deep is the material
that we have to go through?

20:25.725 --> 20:28.361
NARRATOR: Because of
the near zero visibility

20:28.395 --> 20:30.330
caused by the clay and sediment

20:30.363 --> 20:32.865
stirred up
in the 60-inch shaft,

20:32.899 --> 20:35.935
Mike Huntley must rely
only on his sense of touch

20:35.968 --> 20:37.937
to examine
the size and orientation

20:37.970 --> 20:39.972
of the believed plate.

20:40.006 --> 20:41.874
You've got ten minutes.

20:50.950 --> 20:53.420
Is there a way
he could grab a sample?

20:53.453 --> 20:56.356
-If he can.

20:56.389 --> 20:58.591
Is there any way for you
to quick get a sample?

21:12.839 --> 21:15.007
We found something, Rick.

21:25.418 --> 21:27.920
Roger that.
We'll get the chair sent down.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.789
NARRATOR:
With Mike Huntley's dive time

21:29.822 --> 21:32.024
in the D.M.T. shaft
running out,

21:32.058 --> 21:33.860
it is the team's hope that,

21:33.893 --> 21:35.728
by collecting samples
from the bottom

21:35.762 --> 21:38.498
some 77 feet below ground,

21:38.531 --> 21:41.801
Mike will obtain proof
of a believed steel plate

21:41.834 --> 21:45.738
and perhaps whatever it might
have been put there to protect.

21:47.874 --> 21:50.042
MIKE: That was one of the more
frustrating dives I've done.

21:50.076 --> 21:52.612
-Yeah.
-I don't know what's there.

21:52.645 --> 21:55.648
-I stuck that knife

21:55.682 --> 21:58.751
one to 12 o'clock,
center to the edge.

21:58.785 --> 22:00.820
In some spots,
I thought I hit a plate.

22:00.853 --> 22:04.090
And the more I hit it,
it was hard.

22:04.123 --> 22:06.826
RICK: When you're in the moment,
especially on

22:06.859 --> 22:09.095
a tactile dive,
where you can't see anything,

22:09.128 --> 22:11.964
you're groping about,
he comes to surface

22:11.998 --> 22:14.967
and he says, "You're
certainly on something."

22:15.001 --> 22:18.070
We need to go look
at those sample bags.

22:18.104 --> 22:20.740
MIKE:
This is what I found.

22:20.773 --> 22:25.111
I thought I had a hard bottom,
and I could find not a thing.

22:25.144 --> 22:27.980
And the chisel
has hardened alloy steel on it,

22:28.014 --> 22:30.016
-and it broke it apart.
-Yeah. -Yeah.

22:30.049 --> 22:34.987
To do that, Mike, you're into
something very, very hard.

22:35.021 --> 22:36.789
-What you have in that bag, no.
-Wouldn't do it.

22:36.823 --> 22:38.124
-No. No.
-Yeah. No, totally.

22:38.157 --> 22:39.826
RICK:
I think we go back down

22:39.859 --> 22:41.761
and see-see what we find.

22:41.794 --> 22:43.630
Okay. Yeah.

22:43.663 --> 22:46.065
NARRATOR:
Because Mike has reached

22:46.098 --> 22:49.068
his dive time safety limit
for the day,

22:49.101 --> 22:53.573
backup diver Nick Perry will
now descend the D.M.T. shaft.

22:53.606 --> 22:57.544
He will also be equipped with
a pinpointing metal detector

22:57.577 --> 22:59.979
to determine whether or not
the obstruction is metal,

23:00.012 --> 23:02.549
and, if possible, remove it.

23:06.185 --> 23:07.854
All stop!

23:13.159 --> 23:15.595
Roger that, Nick. You can
stand on bottom, correct?

23:20.500 --> 23:21.834
How's it going down there?

23:26.773 --> 23:28.475
MIKE: See if you can dig down
with your knife

23:28.508 --> 23:30.477
or even your hand
and see if you can find it.

23:38.050 --> 23:40.186
Just turn your pinpointer on
and, uh,

23:40.219 --> 23:41.988
metal-detect
the whole hard area.

23:53.866 --> 23:55.868
Peel your glove off, um,

23:55.902 --> 23:58.605
and get a really good,
smooth feel with your hand.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.951
Which doesn't make sense,
because why wouldn't

24:11.984 --> 24:14.153
the oscillator
chew through rock?

24:14.186 --> 24:15.922
Mm.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.924
Uh, some of
the little stone chips,

24:17.957 --> 24:19.992
they might be
in the near vicinity.

24:20.026 --> 24:21.928
Just chuck 'em in your glove
and bring 'em up, just to...

24:21.961 --> 24:23.696
It might be something
of interest.

24:26.833 --> 24:28.801
RICK:
Nick has

24:28.835 --> 24:32.171
felt the rock
underneath the can.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.908
Roger that.

24:35.942 --> 24:37.844
RICK:
And I think we've excluded

24:37.877 --> 24:39.846
the possibility
that it's steel.

24:39.879 --> 24:43.750
So, what do we do?
How do we proceed?

24:43.783 --> 24:45.885
I'm dismayed.

24:45.918 --> 24:48.955
NARRATOR: Because the massive
steel caisson was designed

24:48.988 --> 24:51.257
to drill through
just about anything,

24:51.290 --> 24:53.926
the fact that it couldn't
cut through a granite rock

24:53.960 --> 24:56.028
is deeply confusing.

24:56.062 --> 24:59.065
There is definitely a granite
rock there, 'cause I felt it.

24:59.098 --> 25:01.934
Took the glove off.
You could feel the round edge.

25:01.968 --> 25:04.203
-Rubbed it.
-That's granite.

25:04.236 --> 25:07.206
Well, if it's a hard granite,

25:07.239 --> 25:10.910
there's some granite
that's as hard as steel.

25:10.943 --> 25:14.180
Both Nick and Mike,
uh, to their credit,

25:14.213 --> 25:18.618
have stated forthrightly what
they have observed and/or felt,

25:18.651 --> 25:20.653
and they believe it
to be a-a boulder.

25:20.687 --> 25:22.822
And I think there was hope
all around

25:22.855 --> 25:26.593
that this really was a find.

25:26.626 --> 25:29.662
But it's not,
and-and thus we move on.

25:36.168 --> 25:38.671
NARRATOR:
The following day,

25:38.705 --> 25:42.008
Rick Lagina and members
of the Oak Island team

25:42.041 --> 25:43.910
meet with the crew
from Irving Equipment, Limited,

25:43.943 --> 25:45.845
at the Money Pit site.

25:45.878 --> 25:48.948
Because the 60-inch-wide
drilling caisson

25:48.981 --> 25:50.950
cannot break through
the granite obstruction

25:50.983 --> 25:53.319
at the bottom
of the D.M.T. shaft,

25:53.352 --> 25:56.589
they must accept
a bitter reality:

25:56.623 --> 25:58.925
that further drilling
is out of the question,

25:58.958 --> 26:01.093
at least for now.

26:01.127 --> 26:04.296
They have run out of time
and are dangerously low

26:04.330 --> 26:07.366
on the money they budgeted
for this year.

26:07.399 --> 26:10.336
RICK: Look, it's a-a little
different feel right now

26:10.369 --> 26:13.806
than when we saw you guys come
across the causeway, you know?

26:13.840 --> 26:16.142
But-but I will say this:
it's been a pleasure

26:16.175 --> 26:18.210
working with Irving Group
and with ROC.

26:18.244 --> 26:21.814
It's been fantastic.
Uh, and, you know, you...

26:21.848 --> 26:24.350
we don't walk away
with our heads hanging low.

26:24.383 --> 26:26.318
I mean, there's-there's
something down there.

26:26.352 --> 26:27.920
I really appreciate
being part of it

26:27.954 --> 26:29.789
and hopefully we continue
to be part of it

26:29.822 --> 26:31.357
and get to the bottom
of that hole.

26:31.390 --> 26:33.726
I don't like to make promises
on Oak Island,

26:33.760 --> 26:36.796
but we have every expectation
to see you guys back here.

26:36.829 --> 26:39.031
We'll get to the bottom
of this thing.

26:39.065 --> 26:42.001
It's not "good-bye."
It's "we'll see you soon."

26:42.034 --> 26:44.036
To that end, we're not done.

26:44.070 --> 26:46.005
Scott, thank you.

26:46.038 --> 26:49.676
We've decided
to let Irving and ROC go.

26:49.709 --> 26:51.811
The bitter part of it,
of course,

26:51.844 --> 26:55.314
is that we didn't find
what we had hoped we would find,

26:55.347 --> 27:00.419
some substantial one thing
in H-8

27:00.452 --> 27:04.323
and locating the vault
in the second hole of D.M.T.

27:04.356 --> 27:07.326
But we vigorously investigated

27:07.359 --> 27:10.997
the supposed area
of the Money Pit.

27:11.030 --> 27:13.399
We've got two cans--
large diameter cans--

27:13.432 --> 27:16.435
that have
their structural integrity

27:16.468 --> 27:20.006
and that we can possibly use
for further exploration.

27:20.039 --> 27:22.775
So, we have moved the dial
on Oak Island.

27:22.809 --> 27:25.011
Unfortunately, it still is...

27:25.044 --> 27:28.280
it's still an island of
what ifs and possibilities.

27:28.314 --> 27:31.450
NARRATOR: After a summer
that saw the discovery

27:31.483 --> 27:35.054
of everything from
17th century human bones

27:35.087 --> 27:37.690
to antique jewelry

27:37.724 --> 27:39.992
and a cross
that could date back

27:40.026 --> 27:42.128
to the days
of the Knights Templar,

27:42.161 --> 27:45.798
Rick, Marty, and their team
may be closer than ever

27:45.832 --> 27:48.968
to solving the mystery
of Oak Island.

27:49.001 --> 27:53.405
But now, having invested
another hard year

27:53.439 --> 27:55.207
and millions of dollars,

27:55.241 --> 27:58.077
the time has arrived
for a critical decision.

27:58.110 --> 27:59.846
Should they continue?

27:59.879 --> 28:02.915
And if so, how?

28:07.386 --> 28:08.888
NARRATOR: One day after making
the difficult decision

28:08.921 --> 28:10.823
to end this year's
search operations

28:10.857 --> 28:12.224
at the Money Pit site...

28:12.258 --> 28:14.293
-Charles. Wow.
-Hi, guys.

28:14.326 --> 28:17.063
-That's quite a jigsaw puzzle.
-Yeah.

28:17.096 --> 28:19.298
...brothers Rick
and Marty Lagina

28:19.331 --> 28:21.934
and other members
of the Oak Island team

28:21.968 --> 28:24.170
meet in the war room
for what is likely to be

28:24.203 --> 28:26.773
their final time this year.

28:26.806 --> 28:30.376
Before we begin, I'd like
to get Craig up on the phone.

28:31.944 --> 28:33.379
Looks like we got Craig.
Hey, Craig.

28:33.412 --> 28:35.247
-Hey, Craig! -Hey!

28:35.281 --> 28:39.318
Craig, we're looking at
a display of the year's finds.

28:39.351 --> 28:42.088
We certainly have a mosaic here,

28:42.121 --> 28:45.324
and we have yet
to put it together.

28:45.357 --> 28:47.794
There's a lot of puzzle pieces.

28:47.827 --> 28:49.929
Mom would tell us

28:49.962 --> 28:52.431
get your straight edges here,
put your corner pieces there,

28:52.464 --> 28:54.100
-put your colored pieces here,
-Yeah.

28:54.133 --> 28:56.068
put the blue pieces here.

28:56.102 --> 28:58.470
And that's what we've got
laid out before us.

28:58.504 --> 29:01.173
And we have yet
to figure it out.

29:01.207 --> 29:02.942
-I don't know.

29:02.975 --> 29:05.144
I mean, I'd open it up
for a open table discussion.

29:05.177 --> 29:07.446
-Yep.
-Yeah.

29:07.479 --> 29:10.382
And then, you know, after
everyone's had their input,

29:10.416 --> 29:12.351
uh, there's but one thing
to ask,

29:12.384 --> 29:14.453
and that is:
where do we go from here?

29:14.486 --> 29:16.188
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

29:16.222 --> 29:18.490
Whatever conclusion you come to

29:18.524 --> 29:20.359
is gonna have to be
predicated on...

29:20.392 --> 29:23.062
-How much money we've got.
-Well, sure.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.397
-I agree there. -DAVE:
There's a lot of stuff here

29:25.431 --> 29:27.233
that cost a lot of money
to find.

29:27.266 --> 29:29.201
We are not getting
our money back.

29:29.235 --> 29:31.503
We still need more.
Give us your opinion.

29:31.537 --> 29:33.405
And it doesn't work for us
on Oak Island.

29:33.439 --> 29:35.975
Yeah, but-but wait a minute.
There is a certain weariness

29:36.008 --> 29:38.044
right now
at the end of all this.

29:38.077 --> 29:40.312
There's a certain excitement,
but there's a certain weariness.

29:40.346 --> 29:44.216
So I think a good starting point
would be to make sure

29:44.250 --> 29:46.552
we all understand
what's on the table here.

29:46.585 --> 29:49.922
I mean, there's a lot of stuff.
So why don't you start, Gary?

29:49.956 --> 29:52.458
Discuss what you consider the
highlights of what you found.

29:52.491 --> 29:58.430
This crucifix cross, to me,
is the find of the season.

29:58.464 --> 30:01.567
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

30:01.600 --> 30:03.069
Holy...

30:03.102 --> 30:05.537
Holy schmoly, all right.

30:05.571 --> 30:07.539
-It's a cross.
-Oh, my gosh.

30:07.573 --> 30:10.943
I mean,
that is an old, old cross.

30:10.977 --> 30:14.113
That is really, really old,

30:14.146 --> 30:16.248
and that came
from somewhere else.

30:16.282 --> 30:18.885
What did your analysis
come up with?

30:18.918 --> 30:20.987
13th century or older, Dan,

30:21.020 --> 30:22.321
-is what people are saying.
-Yeah.

30:22.354 --> 30:25.391
Yeah, because this cross
is the type of thing

30:25.424 --> 30:30.897
that's carved into prison walls
and church walls in Europe.

30:30.930 --> 30:34.500
Is this solely
a Templar construct?

30:34.533 --> 30:39.872
It is closely associated
with the crusading orders.

30:41.040 --> 30:43.943
There's a carving in France

30:43.976 --> 30:47.546
in a prison tower
where up to 70 Templar knights

30:47.579 --> 30:51.083
were imprisoned after
they were rounded up in 1307.

30:51.117 --> 30:53.385
1307. That's the tail end
of 'em.

30:53.419 --> 30:55.287
Look at the legs, the head.

30:55.321 --> 30:57.423
Everything's really similar.

30:57.456 --> 31:00.292
RICK:
I think the cross is

31:00.326 --> 31:02.061
a uniquely singular item

31:02.094 --> 31:04.630
-worthy of far more research.
-Absolutely.

31:04.663 --> 31:07.399
So, Charles, what do you think's
most significant on this table?

31:07.433 --> 31:10.069
I think another one of the,
you know, significant finds,

31:10.102 --> 31:13.105
you know, is-is the human bones
out of H-8.

31:13.139 --> 31:15.474
To me, the Money Pit
with the human bones,

31:15.507 --> 31:17.609
that's... you know, it's huge.

31:17.643 --> 31:21.113
To the limits of science, we
know that two people's remains

31:21.147 --> 31:23.515
-are in the Money Pit.
-Yeah.

31:23.549 --> 31:27.153
We have two samples,
uh, both human,

31:27.186 --> 31:30.522
and, uh, it's definitely
two different humans.

31:30.556 --> 31:33.359
We've got Western European
and East Asian.

31:33.392 --> 31:36.362
In carbon dating, 1600s.

31:36.395 --> 31:41.100
Human bones from 162 feet,
below searcher depth.

31:41.133 --> 31:44.170
That's a hell of a depth
to be burying somebody.

31:44.203 --> 31:46.538
-Yeah.
-They take on significance

31:46.572 --> 31:48.307
if they're below six feet.

31:50.676 --> 31:52.678
I agree.

31:52.711 --> 31:55.347
DOUG: What I find exciting
is that piece of parchment

31:55.381 --> 31:59.551
that you found this year in H-8

31:59.585 --> 32:02.654
that corroborates
what William Chappell found

32:02.688 --> 32:05.424
in his drilling in 1897.

32:05.457 --> 32:07.493
You know, you verify
what they found 120 years ago.

32:07.526 --> 32:09.461
You've been able to bring
a piece of a document

32:09.495 --> 32:10.496
up out of the ground.

32:10.529 --> 32:13.165
You know, finding that myself,

32:13.199 --> 32:15.434
I am a hundred percent positive

32:15.467 --> 32:19.505
that there's something very
valuable in the Money Pit area.

32:19.538 --> 32:23.109
RICK: I have always said
that what's here

32:23.142 --> 32:27.013
may be "treasure," there may be
manuscripts or books,

32:27.046 --> 32:29.281
ancient knowledge,
something, something that is

32:29.315 --> 32:31.417
far more valuable
than temporal wealth,

32:31.450 --> 32:36.322
and this substantiates
that belief.

32:36.355 --> 32:39.325
GARY: And there's a couple of
finds we're forgetting about:

32:39.358 --> 32:43.229
those two coins here
have got 1600 dates on them.

32:43.262 --> 32:46.298
One's 1673, was it?

32:46.332 --> 32:49.568
And the other's in the 1690s.

32:49.601 --> 32:51.037
When was the Money Pit
discovered?

32:51.070 --> 32:53.439
-1795.
-1795.

32:53.472 --> 32:56.142
-Right.
-MARTY: That had to be deposited

32:56.175 --> 32:58.010
well before the discovery
of the Money Pit,

32:58.044 --> 33:00.579
-a hundred years before.
-Yeah.

33:00.612 --> 33:01.747
LAIRD:
There's certainly a suggestion

33:01.780 --> 33:03.582
of an earlier occupation.

33:03.615 --> 33:05.184
Pre-Money Pit.

33:05.217 --> 33:07.019
-Yep.
-Wow.

33:10.656 --> 33:13.092
-And did you see the brooch,
the pendant? -I did, yes. Yeah.

33:13.125 --> 33:14.760
-It's-it's so, uh,

33:14.793 --> 33:16.428
it's so interesting.

33:16.462 --> 33:18.330
It's obviously handmade.

33:18.364 --> 33:20.232
It's kind of asymmetrical, too.

33:20.266 --> 33:22.734
DAVE: You said Gary,
that that was all hand-cut;

33:22.768 --> 33:24.370
-that's not machined.
-Yeah.

33:24.403 --> 33:26.272
I remember when I first
picked it up,

33:26.305 --> 33:29.775
and you turned it over, Rick,
you saw all the facets.

33:29.808 --> 33:32.811
I thought this was glass.
It apparently is not glass.

33:32.844 --> 33:36.348
It is a rhodolite garnet,
a semiprecious stone.

33:36.382 --> 33:39.385
This is about what you picture
when you open a treasure chest.

33:39.418 --> 33:42.754
-Mm-hmm. -The lock plate
came from not far off

33:42.788 --> 33:45.357
where the jewel,
the brooch was found.

33:45.391 --> 33:47.426
-MARTY: A key lock cover.
-GARY: Yeah.

33:47.459 --> 33:50.229
I mean, I-I know I'm playing
junior archeologist here,

33:50.262 --> 33:52.398
but I can't help
but draw the conclusion.

33:54.400 --> 33:57.569
RICK: Dan, you brought
this collective,

33:57.603 --> 33:59.405
if you will, together.

33:59.438 --> 34:01.240
What do you think?

34:01.273 --> 34:02.541
I don't know.

34:04.510 --> 34:07.146
Far as I'm concerned,
everything you got

34:07.179 --> 34:09.548
on the table
doesn't prove or disprove

34:09.581 --> 34:11.383
whether there's treasure
on Oak Island.

34:11.417 --> 34:15.387
I would say probably
75%, 80% of that

34:15.421 --> 34:17.556
is all from the surface.

34:17.589 --> 34:21.393
All that your surface finds
are doing

34:21.427 --> 34:24.163
is giving you a known, anyway.

34:24.196 --> 34:26.798
At sometime or another,

34:26.832 --> 34:30.569
someone has spent a lot of time
on the surface of Oak Island.

34:30.602 --> 34:34.673
It's very graphic as far as
looking at it is concerned,

34:34.706 --> 34:37.243
but, I mean, in the same token,

34:37.276 --> 34:39.745
it's time consuming
and expensive.

34:39.778 --> 34:42.814
That's no BS.
That's fact.

34:42.848 --> 34:45.151
MARTY:
Dan, let me ask you a question.

34:45.184 --> 34:47.719
Should we keep going?

34:54.493 --> 34:57.829
MARTY: Hey, Dan, let me ask you
a really tough question.

34:57.863 --> 35:00.132
You want us to quit?

35:00.166 --> 35:03.435
That's a hard question, Marty.
It really is.

35:03.469 --> 35:05.704
It's a deep question
and it's hard.

35:05.737 --> 35:08.474
NARRATOR: The Oak Island team
has gathered in the war room

35:08.507 --> 35:11.877
for what could be their most
important decision to date:

35:11.910 --> 35:14.580
whether to continue forward,

35:14.613 --> 35:18.484
or put their entire operation
on hold indefinitely.

35:18.517 --> 35:20.386
Dan, you have any thoughts?

35:20.419 --> 35:23.822
How deep is your pockets?

35:25.724 --> 35:29.195
It boils down to whether
it's worth it.

35:29.228 --> 35:31.630
That's the key question though,
Dan. How do you evaluate that?

35:31.663 --> 35:34.233
Whether it's worth it.
How do you evaluate that?

35:34.266 --> 35:37.135
What should affect it is...

35:39.738 --> 35:42.374
...the hard evidence
that has come out

35:42.408 --> 35:45.311
is substantiating
up to a certain extent,

35:45.344 --> 35:47.346
but I don't think you should put

35:47.379 --> 35:50.882
too much undue influence
on this here.

35:50.916 --> 35:53.185
DAVE: Question, Marty:
why are we grouping

35:53.219 --> 35:55.554
all the coins together
with the, with the jewel now?

35:57.789 --> 36:01.227
Well, if you opened a little box
and you found that,

36:01.260 --> 36:04.263
you might say you found a bit

36:06.265 --> 36:08.667
It kind of looks like a regular
mini treasure chest, doesn't it?

36:08.700 --> 36:10.469
GARY:
Yup.

36:10.502 --> 36:13.239
MARTY: Well, I will say this
from my own standpoint.

36:13.272 --> 36:14.840
I entered
this whole quest thinking

36:14.873 --> 36:18.210
that maybe nothing
of any consequence

36:18.244 --> 36:21.213
really happened on this island
prior to 1790.

36:21.247 --> 36:23.949
But as this year
draws to a close,

36:23.982 --> 36:28.520
I have to say
I don't believe that anymore.

36:28.554 --> 36:31.490
-There's too much here.
-Yep. -Yeah.

36:31.523 --> 36:35.827
I now believe something
did happen here prior to 1790.

36:35.861 --> 36:37.996
-Well, there you go. -DAVE:
It's quite obvious, Marty.

36:38.029 --> 36:39.498
That's getting somewhere.

36:41.900 --> 36:43.835
-You've come a long way.
-I have. I have.

36:45.904 --> 36:47.539
We can't stop now.
I mean, look what we've found

36:47.573 --> 36:49.975
-so far this year.
-Yeah. -Yeah.

36:50.008 --> 36:53.379
Okay, I know
what you want to do.

36:53.412 --> 36:57.649
Oh, yeah. I know where
I want to be next year.

36:57.683 --> 36:59.785
I'm like a kid in a candy store.
I really am.

36:59.818 --> 37:01.653
-I think you've got some of

37:01.687 --> 37:03.889
the most convincing evidence
in the last 120 years.

37:03.922 --> 37:06.725
All's I can tell you is,
if you continue,

37:06.758 --> 37:08.494
I'm here to support you
in any way I can.

37:08.527 --> 37:10.829
Well, Charles?

37:10.862 --> 37:12.831
Let's put it this way:
I don't want you to quit.

37:12.864 --> 37:14.900
Okay. All right. Fair enough.

37:14.933 --> 37:16.902
Hey, Laird, I'd love to hear
what you have to say.

37:16.935 --> 37:19.538
Well, the archaeologist,
we need, we need this stuff.

37:19.571 --> 37:21.640
We need the hard evidence.

37:21.673 --> 37:23.542
Is your excitement level
higher though? Are you...

37:23.575 --> 37:25.644
Oh, yeah. No, absolutely.

37:25.677 --> 37:27.279
Well, Dan what do you think?

37:27.313 --> 37:29.448
First thought I have

37:29.481 --> 37:32.318
is that you're pretty close
to the right location.

37:32.351 --> 37:33.752
You wouldn't quit though,
would you?

37:33.785 --> 37:35.287
Can't say I wouldn't.

37:35.321 --> 37:37.823
Just that, uh,
I wouldn't want to.

37:37.856 --> 37:40.292
All right, Dan.
Let's ask Craig.

37:40.326 --> 37:42.328
You've been listening
to all this.

37:42.361 --> 37:43.962
CRAIG: Well, the evidence
this year, Marty,

37:43.995 --> 37:45.697
you know,
we didn't find the treasure,

37:45.731 --> 37:48.066
but I think we had
a fantastic year.

37:48.099 --> 37:49.701
-Yes.
-We got a number

37:49.735 --> 37:51.870
of major things out
in Smith's Cove.

37:51.903 --> 37:54.039
The U-shaped structure.

37:54.072 --> 37:57.042
And could there be more things
like the lead cross,

37:57.075 --> 37:59.044
that could tell us who did it?

37:59.077 --> 38:00.946
Um, yeah, definitely.

38:00.979 --> 38:03.915
-Jack, I think it's your turn.
-Yep.

38:03.949 --> 38:09.655
I-I think that we still have
a lot of exploring left to do,

38:09.688 --> 38:11.857
and this year proved it.

38:11.890 --> 38:14.493
MARTY:
What say you, number one son?

38:14.526 --> 38:16.895
Year one,
I was kind of thinking,

38:16.928 --> 38:18.830
"Come on, what are we really
gonna find?"

38:18.864 --> 38:20.499
This-this year, I'm thinking,

38:20.532 --> 38:21.900
"Okay, there's a lot more
to be found."

38:21.933 --> 38:23.869
-We moved you a long way.
-Oh, yeah.

38:23.902 --> 38:26.004
You always thought
when I told you the story,

38:26.037 --> 38:28.106
you always thought, "Oh,
there goes Uncle Rick on again."

38:28.139 --> 38:29.775
-Yeah.
-I did. I did.

38:31.910 --> 38:34.413
I won't lie.
I did think that.

38:34.446 --> 38:36.014
-RICK: Mm-hmm.
-I don't think it anymore.

38:36.047 --> 38:38.817
The preponderance
of evidence here,

38:38.850 --> 38:41.920
I-I wouldn't drill this up
and then stop.

38:41.953 --> 38:43.889
That's my opinion.

38:43.922 --> 38:46.057
Depending upon how old you are.

38:46.091 --> 38:49.495
I came here over 50 years ago,

38:49.528 --> 38:52.931
and what attracted me
to Oak Island was the mystery.

38:52.964 --> 38:56.101
-That's what attracted me.
-Okay.

38:56.134 --> 38:58.504
Do you feel there's still
a mystery to solve here?

38:58.537 --> 39:01.072
Well, the answer to that
would have to be yes.

39:01.106 --> 39:05.477
Amen. And with that, I will see
what fearless leader says.

39:05.511 --> 39:07.779
What do you want to do?

39:07.813 --> 39:10.616
I-I think what we need to do,
given the amount

39:10.649 --> 39:13.752
of significant material there,
I'm gonna fall back

39:13.785 --> 39:17.589
on what Dan suggested to us
last year: take a step back.

39:17.623 --> 39:21.727
Try to, uh, ascertain
what all of this may mean.

39:21.760 --> 39:26.097
And, uh, for me, this puzzle is:

39:26.131 --> 39:28.934
who, what, when, where,
why and how.

39:28.967 --> 39:34.406
And this year in particular,
this little piece of parchment

39:34.440 --> 39:37.476
might be the "what."

39:37.509 --> 39:40.746
And this little item right here,

39:40.779 --> 39:44.683
this might be a clue
to lead us to "who."

39:44.716 --> 39:48.186
And the rest will fall into
place, but we have to follow.

39:48.219 --> 39:51.623
We speak a lot
about family here,

39:51.657 --> 39:53.692
and for Marty and I,
we always round back

39:53.725 --> 39:56.027
-to Mom and Dad.
-Yeah.

39:56.061 --> 39:58.129
So Mom would say, you know,

39:58.163 --> 40:00.632
"Sempre avanti,
always forward.

40:00.666 --> 40:02.868
Get the puzzle together."

40:02.901 --> 40:05.871
But, for me, the only way to
really put this thing together

40:05.904 --> 40:08.574
is for us to do it together.

40:08.607 --> 40:10.809
One in, all in,
once in, forever in.

40:10.842 --> 40:12.043
-Oh, yeah.
-Absolutely.

40:12.077 --> 40:13.779
-Yeah, definitely.
-Yeah.

40:13.812 --> 40:15.180
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

40:15.213 --> 40:18.584
So, I say we celebrate.

40:18.617 --> 40:20.652
-I say we declare victory.
-It's crown time.

40:20.686 --> 40:21.720
It's crown time!

40:21.753 --> 40:25.824
I say... to the fellowship.

40:25.857 --> 40:27.726
-To the fellowship of the dig.
-All right.

40:34.600 --> 40:36.868
NARRATOR: As another exciting
and emotional year

40:36.902 --> 40:38.904
on Oak Island
comes to an end...

40:38.937 --> 40:40.539
Well, guys, it's been
a good year, Dave.

40:40.572 --> 40:41.873
-Well, take care.
-Thanks a lot.

40:41.907 --> 40:43.842
-Dude. -Rick, yeah.
-We'll see you.

40:43.875 --> 40:45.611
...brothers
Rick and Marty Lagina

40:45.644 --> 40:48.046
leave the island
with no regrets.

40:48.079 --> 40:50.716
-You've turned into
a regular man hugger. -Yeah.

40:50.749 --> 40:52.150
-Rick.
-Hey.

40:52.183 --> 40:54.252
NARRATOR:
Although they have, so far,

40:54.285 --> 40:57.523
not found anything resembling
a fabled golden treasure...

40:57.556 --> 40:59.257
I'm gonna miss you, Charles.

40:59.290 --> 41:01.159
-Miss you, too, buddy.
-Dan.

41:01.192 --> 41:02.961
...they have uncovered evidence

41:02.994 --> 41:04.863
that could be
of even greater value...

41:04.896 --> 41:06.498
See you, Laird.

41:06.532 --> 41:08.133
...evidence that could change

41:08.166 --> 41:10.068
not only the history
of North America,

41:10.101 --> 41:12.237
but the world.

41:12.270 --> 41:14.773
See you all, guys.

41:14.806 --> 41:17.609
RICK:
We certainly made progress

41:17.643 --> 41:20.946
and I think that, you know,
we certainly have a...

41:20.979 --> 41:23.849
a substantial amount
of puzzle pieces.

41:23.882 --> 41:27.519
And now it's getting time

41:27.553 --> 41:29.821
where we start putting
some of these pieces together.

41:29.855 --> 41:31.923
We need connective tissue.

41:31.957 --> 41:35.060
MARTY:
To some extent,

41:35.093 --> 41:37.062
it's like
a love-hate relationship.

41:37.095 --> 41:38.930
This island is-- can be brutal.

41:40.999 --> 41:44.703
And it can be rewarding,
and it's beautiful...

41:44.736 --> 41:48.907
but it's mystical...

41:48.940 --> 41:53.712
and it's all those things,
but it's time to take a break.

41:53.745 --> 41:56.848
The search goes home
for a while.

41:56.882 --> 41:58.850
-For now.
-Yeah.
