00:04.003 --> 00:06.131
Did you kill Nia Bailey?
(gunshots)

00:06.172 --> 00:08.758
I won't let you get away
with it.

00:08.800 --> 00:11.428
It's a button
from Murphy's jacket.
MAX: They're gonna find Murphy's

00:11.469 --> 00:12.554
DNA and it's only
a matter of time

00:12.595 --> 00:14.055
before they find the bodies.

00:14.097 --> 00:15.849
It's over.

00:15.890 --> 00:17.684
Murphy, you're under arrest. You
have the right to remain silent.

00:17.726 --> 00:18.935
Anything you say can
and will be used

00:18.977 --> 00:20.270
against you in
a court of law.

00:20.311 --> 00:21.813
I promise

00:21.855 --> 00:24.315
I'm gonna help
get you out of this.

00:24.357 --> 00:27.152
Good luck.

FELIX: You don't worry, okay?

02:32.026 --> 02:34.529
I am going
to get you out of there.

02:36.281 --> 02:38.950
Felix, y-you're good
at so many things.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.702
Um...

02:40.743 --> 02:42.912
but I think I'd prefer,
uh, a lawyer

02:42.954 --> 02:44.747
who actually...

02:44.789 --> 02:46.332
well, passed the bar, you know?

02:46.374 --> 02:48.042
For this.
Okay.

02:48.084 --> 02:50.086
First of all,
the room I took it in

02:50.128 --> 02:52.547
was incredibly drafty, so it
was impossible to concentrate.

02:52.589 --> 02:53.756
Okay.

02:53.798 --> 02:56.134
And I'm talking
about my sister.

02:57.051 --> 02:58.386
For some reason,

02:58.428 --> 03:01.014
she offered
to take on your case.

03:02.473 --> 03:03.975
Really?
Yeah.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.643
She thinks
she can actually win this.

03:05.685 --> 03:06.811
She says
without a murder weapon,

03:06.853 --> 03:07.979
it'll be hard to convict.

03:10.690 --> 03:13.359
Wow. Uh...

03:13.401 --> 03:15.486
That's... Tell-tell her,
"Thank you."

03:15.528 --> 03:17.113
I will.

03:17.155 --> 03:20.200
Are you-are you sure
you're okay in there?

03:20.241 --> 03:22.911
I know Sam was...

03:22.952 --> 03:25.163
Sam's not here.

03:25.204 --> 03:27.332
They, uh...

03:27.373 --> 03:29.626
sent me straight to...

03:29.667 --> 03:31.169
prison 'cause I-I guess,

03:31.211 --> 03:33.671
apparently, the jail
wasn't accessible.

03:33.713 --> 03:35.340
Oh, thank God.

03:35.381 --> 03:38.384
How's your bed?
Is it comfortable?

03:38.426 --> 03:41.221
Who knows? I haven't even
been to my cell yet.

03:41.262 --> 03:43.305
They-they took me
straight here.

03:43.348 --> 03:45.642
GUARD: That's time.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.687
Okay, your bail hearing

03:49.728 --> 03:51.856
is only in two days, okay?

03:51.898 --> 03:55.401
I will get the money
and I will be there.

03:56.736 --> 03:58.112
Promise?

03:59.781 --> 04:01.908
I promise.

04:05.411 --> 04:07.497
I love you, Felix.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.627
I love you, Murph.

04:17.923 --> 04:19.007
(sighs)

04:19.050 --> 04:21.261
Stop. I'll be okay.

04:21.302 --> 04:24.055

Come on, Mason, let's go.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.516

04:41.447 --> 04:43.533
Thanks.

04:45.994 --> 04:48.079
(sniffles)

05:04.137 --> 05:05.888
Hi, Murphy.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.311
They told me that you...

05:11.352 --> 05:13.771
I paid off a guard
to transfer me.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.818
See, when you killed Nia,

05:18.860 --> 05:20.611
I swore I'd do the same to you.

05:20.653 --> 05:22.655
Please, please, I'm begging you.

05:22.697 --> 05:24.157
I'm begging. Please.
Relax.

05:24.198 --> 05:26.701
There are cameras
trained on every cell.

05:26.743 --> 05:29.746
I can't touch you in here.

05:29.787 --> 05:32.123
But you're gonna
have to leave eventually.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.875
No, please.
And when you do...

05:33.916 --> 05:36.252
I'm-I'm sor-sorry.

05:36.294 --> 05:38.921
...you're done.

05:38.963 --> 05:41.090
(laughs)
This is gonna be fun.

05:41.132 --> 05:43.593
Please, please, please...

05:48.723 --> 05:50.808
Oh, God!

05:58.524 --> 06:00.360
What do you mean
you can't pay her bail?

06:00.401 --> 06:01.694
You're the only one
with money around here.

06:01.736 --> 06:04.322
A defendant's lawyer
can't pay it.

06:05.281 --> 06:06.199
How much money
you got?

06:06.240 --> 06:08.326
You know I have none.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.410
Perfect!

06:09.452 --> 06:10.745
I promised her.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.413
MAX:
Hey, I don't like

06:12.455 --> 06:14.374
that she's in there, either,
but there's nothing we can do.

06:14.415 --> 06:16.751
And you said she's fine,
she's safe.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.336
No, he's acting all
tough, but she...

06:18.378 --> 06:20.380
she's terrified.

06:20.421 --> 06:22.507
I got to do something.

06:24.342 --> 06:26.803
I have 30 grand in cash here.

06:31.766 --> 06:33.558
Dad said to keep cash
around in case you need it.

06:33.601 --> 06:35.895
Yeah, I kept, like, 40 bucks.

06:35.937 --> 06:39.023
Anyway, I'm sure
I can argue

06:39.065 --> 06:41.526
her bail down under 300 grand,
and you only need to pay

06:41.567 --> 06:43.653
ten percent, so...

06:44.779 --> 06:46.239
...take it.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.325
(quiet laugh)

06:49.367 --> 06:50.618
(knocking)

07:03.005 --> 07:05.425
Here.
Her parents weren't home.

07:05.466 --> 07:08.219
What?
(Pretzel whining)

07:08.261 --> 07:10.138
Hey, buddy.
I know, buddy.

07:10.179 --> 07:11.722
Hi.
I know.

07:11.764 --> 07:13.683
JOSH:
Looking forward
to seeing you all in court.

07:17.353 --> 07:18.896
I'm gonna make sure
Murphy rots in prison

07:18.938 --> 07:22.024
for the rest of her life.

07:22.066 --> 07:23.693
Have a good one.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.408
GLENWAY:
You have Ms. Mason's

07:30.450 --> 07:32.577
DNA at the crime scene,

07:32.618 --> 07:34.078
along with the victim's, and
then she fled the country.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.580
Innocent people
don't do that.

07:35.621 --> 07:37.498
Yep, that's because
she's very, very guilty.

07:37.540 --> 07:40.418
And I don't think we'd have
any trouble convincing a jury.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.170
I'd say barring
some miracle,

07:42.211 --> 07:43.838
this case is pretty airtight.
JOSH: What kind of miracle?

07:43.880 --> 07:46.007
GLENWAY:
I don't know, she's
got Lesley Bell.

07:46.048 --> 07:48.759
She's vicious.
But like I said,

07:48.801 --> 07:50.219
a competent jury
will be able to see through

07:50.261 --> 07:52.096
whatever bogus defense
she comes up with.

07:52.138 --> 07:54.140
What defense could
she possibly come up with?
SARAH: Josh.

07:54.182 --> 07:55.391
Did you hear her?

07:55.433 --> 07:58.269
Just be happy for two seconds.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.896
Thank you, Jamie.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.027
LEO:
Chief.

08:06.068 --> 08:07.403
GENE:
Navarro. What can I do
for you, man?

08:07.445 --> 08:09.030
Sorry to bother you.
This was just called in.

08:09.071 --> 08:10.448
I thought you might
want to get down there ASAP,

08:10.490 --> 08:11.365
since the press will
be all over this one.

08:11.407 --> 08:13.409
What is it?

08:13.451 --> 08:14.869
Sorority girl found dead

08:14.911 --> 08:16.621
this morning at North Chicago U.

08:16.662 --> 08:18.164
Okay, let's get it.

08:18.206 --> 08:19.624
Wait, wait, wait--
what about Murphy?

08:19.665 --> 08:21.042
What about Murphy?
Well, I was just thinking

08:21.082 --> 08:23.169
what if we go
after Lesley?

08:23.211 --> 08:25.379
Lesley Bell?
She's representing her.

08:25.421 --> 08:27.173
She won't be able to from jail.

08:27.215 --> 08:28.966
We know she was
harboring fugitives.

08:29.008 --> 08:31.219
What's your endgame?

08:31.260 --> 08:32.929
JOSH:
We get rid of Lesley
and hopefully Murphy

08:32.970 --> 08:36.474
gets stuck with some... some
overworked public defender.

08:39.268 --> 08:41.437
Okay, okay, fine. Uh, Navarro,

08:41.479 --> 08:43.397
why don't you stay here and help
Josh with that, all right?

08:43.438 --> 08:46.817
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
didn't he start, like yesterday?

08:46.859 --> 08:48.819
Last week, actually.
Last week.

08:48.861 --> 08:50.279
Good luck.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.617
Cool, uh...

08:54.659 --> 08:56.744
let's just call the judge.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.467
GUARD:
Murphy Mason?

09:11.509 --> 09:13.928
Yes.

09:13.970 --> 09:16.305
I'm Joe. I run this cell block.

09:18.057 --> 09:19.183
Okay.

09:19.225 --> 09:20.518
I know you're new here,

09:20.560 --> 09:21.769
but meals are mandatory.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.354
Get to the cafeteria.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.730
What?

09:24.772 --> 09:26.691
No, no, I-I... I...

09:26.732 --> 09:28.276
I... don't...

09:28.317 --> 09:30.236
I can just...
gonna stay in my cell.

09:30.278 --> 09:31.737
I-I don't need to go.

09:31.779 --> 09:33.197
I'm not hu...
I'm... I don't need to eat.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.032
It's non-negotiable.

09:35.074 --> 09:37.034
Get up.
Lunch started five minutes ago.

09:37.076 --> 09:38.703
Can... Oh, my God...

09:38.744 --> 09:40.621
C-Can you...
Will you walk me there?

09:40.663 --> 09:42.206
Because I don't know
how to get there. I'm...

09:42.248 --> 09:43.958
I don't know
where it is, obviously.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.126
Please.

09:45.167 --> 09:46.877

Yeah.

09:46.919 --> 09:48.129

See, we know this girl.

26:19.369 --> 26:21.997
She's blind
and was in a bad way,

26:22.038 --> 26:24.165
so I offered her a place
to stay for a couple of nights.

26:24.207 --> 26:25.625
Mm-hmm.
I was just trying

26:25.667 --> 26:27.335
to do a good deed
for someone in need.

26:27.377 --> 26:30.589
You always taught us
to help those less fortunate.

26:31.965 --> 26:34.467
But the problem is,

26:34.509 --> 26:37.053
this girl ended up getting
into some trouble with the law.

26:37.095 --> 26:39.306
Of course,
I didn't know this.

26:39.347 --> 26:41.224
But now they're trying
to drag me into it and I...

26:41.266 --> 26:42.642
MAVIS:
You know what?

26:42.684 --> 26:45.186
Let's talk about all this
after lunch.

26:45.228 --> 26:47.439
I just want to enjoy
this meal with you.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.649
Well, actually, Gran,

26:49.691 --> 26:51.860
it's a bit time-sensitive...
Max?

26:51.901 --> 26:53.612
Tell me something
about yourself.

26:53.653 --> 26:55.322
FELIX:
Oh, my God, Gran.

26:55.363 --> 26:57.949
Lesley is asking for your help.

26:57.991 --> 27:00.285
It's nothing that can't wait
until after lunch.

27:00.327 --> 27:02.162
Actually...
Felix.

27:03.913 --> 27:06.124
I said I was going
to enjoy this meal.

27:06.166 --> 27:08.668
And that is
what I'm going to do.

27:11.338 --> 27:12.756
(Mavis exhales)

27:12.797 --> 27:15.091
How many times
have I told Lydia

27:15.133 --> 27:17.177
to clear the table
between courses?

27:17.218 --> 27:18.845
You know what,
it's fine, I'll do it.

27:18.887 --> 27:21.139
'Cause that thing we have
to be at starts very, very soon.

27:21.181 --> 27:23.933
Felix, stop with
the theatrics.

27:23.975 --> 27:26.227
I really don't mind.

27:28.563 --> 27:30.774
I'll get him.

27:33.818 --> 27:35.904
(sighing)

27:39.074 --> 27:41.034
You have to keep it together
or she's never gonna do

27:41.076 --> 27:43.161
this for us.
If we don't leave right now,

27:43.203 --> 27:44.496
we're gonna miss
her bail hearing.

27:44.537 --> 27:46.331
We can't go anywhere yet.

27:46.373 --> 27:48.583
Oh, my God!

27:50.418 --> 27:51.836
Okay, I have
a friend who still works

27:51.878 --> 27:53.421
in the public defender's office,

27:53.463 --> 27:55.131
and he's desperate
for this job at my firm.

27:55.173 --> 27:57.092
He will do literally anything
for me right now.

27:57.133 --> 27:59.427
Meaning...
Meaning I'll send him

27:59.469 --> 28:01.596
my arraignment notes, he'll
haul ass to the courthouse

28:01.638 --> 28:03.264
and make sure Murphy's bail
stays low enough.

28:03.306 --> 28:06.351
Just get back
in there.

28:06.393 --> 28:08.978
FELIX: Remember,
under 300 grand.

28:09.020 --> 28:11.064
Hi, Timothy.

28:11.106 --> 28:13.525
Next!

28:15.026 --> 28:17.112
Murphy Mason.

28:22.117 --> 28:23.952
OFFICER:
Chair's right here.

28:33.211 --> 28:35.296
Felix?

28:38.758 --> 28:40.844
Lesley?

28:43.096 --> 28:45.598
Hello?
There's no one there,
Miss Mason.

28:45.640 --> 28:47.976
Do you have
representation?

28:51.479 --> 28:53.523
Yes.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.650
I do.

28:55.692 --> 28:57.819
They're probably running late,
I-I think.

28:57.861 --> 28:59.320
Um...
TIMOTHY:
I'm her lawyer, Judge.

28:59.362 --> 29:01.364
Timothy Andrews.

29:01.406 --> 29:03.575
Nice to see you again.

29:06.119 --> 29:07.996
Who is Timothy Andrews?

29:08.037 --> 29:09.748
Lesley Bell sent me.
She got tied up.

29:09.789 --> 29:12.041
You lucked out, trust me.

29:12.959 --> 29:14.294
Where's Felix?

29:14.335 --> 29:16.421
Who's Felix?

29:22.594 --> 29:24.471
Are we ready, Counselor?

29:24.512 --> 29:26.973
Uh, yeah, actually.

29:27.015 --> 29:29.893
I just need a, uh, moment
to go over my notes.

29:29.934 --> 29:32.061
I've already given
this case its allotted time.

29:32.103 --> 29:34.272
Now how does your client plea?

29:34.314 --> 29:36.441
Uh...

29:38.860 --> 29:40.737
Uh...

29:40.779 --> 29:43.615
Not guilty, Your Honor.
I am not guilty.

29:43.656 --> 29:46.618
Yeah, yes.
Yes, not guilty, Your Honor.

29:46.659 --> 29:48.703
And considering
the fact that she is

29:48.745 --> 29:50.497
severely handicapped,

29:50.538 --> 29:53.458
I think that we could all agree
she does not pose a flight risk

29:53.500 --> 29:55.585
and can be released
on her own recognizance.

29:55.627 --> 29:57.462
Judge,
with all due respect,

29:57.504 --> 29:59.130
this is absurd.

29:59.172 --> 30:01.174
Ms. Mason fled the state,

30:01.216 --> 30:02.884
the country,
and the interrogation room

30:02.926 --> 30:05.345
after she was charged
with the murder of Nia Bailey.

30:05.386 --> 30:07.639
She's the definition
of a flight risk.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.899
But she's blind.

30:17.941 --> 30:21.069
So she's not gonna
go anywhere again.

30:27.033 --> 30:29.077
I'm setting the bail
at $2 million.

30:29.118 --> 30:31.287
(gavel bangs)
Next.

30:31.329 --> 30:33.748
What?

30:39.712 --> 30:41.130
Your friend call you?

30:41.172 --> 30:43.591
Not yet. I told you,
I'll tell you when he does.

30:45.718 --> 30:47.971
Gran, thank you so much again.

30:48.012 --> 30:49.681
Oh, of course.

30:49.722 --> 30:51.516
Mm, Lydia will get your coats.

30:51.558 --> 30:54.769
And you're all
welcome any time.

30:54.811 --> 30:56.020
That includes you, Max.

30:56.062 --> 30:57.564
Thank you.
Lunch was delicious.

30:57.605 --> 30:58.940
LESLEY:
And, listen, if you could

30:58.982 --> 31:01.442
make that call
about our situation...

31:01.484 --> 31:03.194
I would do anything for family,
you know that.

31:03.236 --> 31:05.113
Consider it done.

31:05.154 --> 31:07.240
Thank you.

31:11.202 --> 31:13.496
But, listen,
if I do this,

31:13.538 --> 31:15.915
you will be present
in my life.

31:15.957 --> 31:17.750
I won't have you
ignoring me

31:17.792 --> 31:19.794
the way you have
for the past three years.

31:19.836 --> 31:21.838
Understood?

31:21.880 --> 31:23.298
Wh... uh...
Of course.

31:23.339 --> 31:24.883
Well, can we talk
about this...

31:24.924 --> 31:27.594
Understood,
Felix?

31:27.635 --> 31:29.262
Understood.

31:29.304 --> 31:31.097
Great.

31:31.139 --> 31:33.433
I love you both
to the moon and back.

31:33.474 --> 31:36.144
And I'll see you tomorrow
for a benefit I'm hosting.

31:36.185 --> 31:38.563
Shall I send one car,
or two?

31:38.605 --> 31:40.690
One's fine.

31:43.192 --> 31:45.945
JOSH:
I wish you could
have been there.

31:45.987 --> 31:48.990
She was totally convinced
that she was getting out today.

31:49.032 --> 31:51.326
It was glorious.
Yeah?

31:51.367 --> 31:52.744
Hey, uh, sorry to interrupt.

31:52.785 --> 31:53.870
I just got a call
from Lake County.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.288
Both of the Bell siblings' cases

31:55.330 --> 31:56.414
were transferred up there,
apparently?

31:56.456 --> 31:57.916
Wait, what?

31:57.957 --> 31:59.834
I guess
it's in their jurisdiction.

31:59.876 --> 32:01.210
I'm sorry, but the day

32:01.252 --> 32:03.296
we subpoenaed her
for her door cam footage,

32:03.338 --> 32:04.964
the case gets transferred?

32:05.006 --> 32:06.591
That's extremely fishy.

32:06.633 --> 32:08.217
Cases get transferred
all the time.

32:08.259 --> 32:10.345
GENE: Yeah, don't
sweat it, man.

32:10.386 --> 32:12.180
We have a solid case
against Murphy.

32:12.221 --> 32:13.765
Can you give me the names

32:13.806 --> 32:15.642
of all the members
and pledges of the sorority?

32:15.683 --> 32:18.311
Thank you.
JOSH: Y-You have to find
this strange too, right?

32:18.353 --> 32:20.855
Honestly, Josh...

32:20.897 --> 32:23.107
I'm not sure what more you want.

32:23.149 --> 32:25.985
What?
What, you want her in the
electric chair or something?

32:26.027 --> 32:28.655
No, I...
Gene is trying to stop

32:28.696 --> 32:30.615
another Nia Bailey from
killing thousands of people

32:30.657 --> 32:32.408
and all you care
about is getting

32:32.450 --> 32:35.119
another piece of evidence on
a girl who we already arrested.

32:35.161 --> 32:37.288
Just...

32:37.330 --> 32:39.958
let it go.

32:57.892 --> 32:59.560
Mason.

32:59.602 --> 33:01.688
You're still here.

33:02.855 --> 33:04.941
Yeah.

33:05.400 --> 33:08.861
Hey, at least there's
pancakes for breakfast.

33:08.903 --> 33:10.989
Come on.

33:35.888 --> 33:37.974
Just one second.

33:39.892 --> 33:41.853
Okay.
This isn't
the cafeteria.

33:41.894 --> 33:43.688
Nope.

33:43.730 --> 33:45.690
Okay, come here.

33:45.732 --> 33:47.358
Sorry.

33:47.400 --> 33:49.569
Just sit-sit down.

33:49.610 --> 33:51.821
Okay?

33:51.863 --> 33:53.990
I run Bible study here,
so I am

33:54.032 --> 33:56.367
the only one
with access to this cabinet,

33:56.409 --> 33:58.745
and don't worry,
the guards love me.

33:58.786 --> 34:00.997
They're gonna count us
at meals tonight.

34:02.290 --> 34:04.876
Okay, here we go.
Here.

34:07.920 --> 34:10.089
Just... eat.

34:10.130 --> 34:12.341
For the love of God.

34:13.259 --> 34:14.677
(exhales)

34:16.971 --> 34:18.473
Look, at this point,
Murphy,

34:18.514 --> 34:20.224
you are gonna die
of starvation

34:20.266 --> 34:22.560
or you're gonna have
to choose to trust me

34:22.601 --> 34:24.978
and eat
the stupid cracker.

34:25.438 --> 34:28.733
It is just a cracker.
I promise.

34:28.775 --> 34:30.025
I mean...

34:30.068 --> 34:32.737
it's that
and the Body of Christ,

34:32.779 --> 34:34.697
but, you know...

34:38.618 --> 34:40.203
Come on.

34:55.635 --> 34:57.595
(crunching)

35:04.102 --> 35:06.104
(wrapper rustling)

35:09.774 --> 35:12.026
(crunching)

35:13.194 --> 35:14.654
(chuckles):
Wow.

35:14.695 --> 35:17.240
(chuckling)

35:17.281 --> 35:18.699
I mean,
I knew you were hungry,

35:18.741 --> 35:20.243
but wow.

35:20.284 --> 35:21.536
Sorry.
Don't be.

35:21.577 --> 35:23.454
Just eat.

35:26.207 --> 35:29.001
Like I said, you are gonna need
some friends in here.

35:29.919 --> 35:31.796
Okay.

35:31.838 --> 35:34.257
Don't these things
come with, um...

35:34.298 --> 35:35.550
with wine?

35:36.509 --> 35:38.636
In here? No. But...

35:39.095 --> 35:43.641
The girls and I made this
for special occasions.

35:43.683 --> 35:45.601
(chuckles) It'll do the trick.

35:47.812 --> 35:49.188
Here.

35:56.154 --> 35:57.655
Oh, my God.
Yeah.

35:57.697 --> 35:59.657
It is not good.
(groans)

35:59.699 --> 36:00.908
(chuckles)

36:00.950 --> 36:02.743
I mean, I like cheap wine.

36:02.785 --> 36:04.912
I-I drink... really cheap wine.

36:04.954 --> 36:06.497
But this is so bad.

36:06.539 --> 36:08.541
That cost us, like, a hundred
bucks for the tomatoes,

36:08.583 --> 36:10.126
so enjoy it.

36:10.168 --> 36:11.252
I'm trying.

36:11.294 --> 36:12.920
(inhales, exhales)

36:12.962 --> 36:14.505
(inhales sharply)

36:16.257 --> 36:18.217
Sorry. It's so tart.
(chuckles)

36:18.259 --> 36:19.635
Okay, come on.

36:19.677 --> 36:21.470
Give me that.

36:21.512 --> 36:22.930
Ooh.

36:26.434 --> 36:28.769
I'm impressed. Wow.

36:28.811 --> 36:32.023
(chuckles) Straight
to the back of the throat, babe.

36:32.064 --> 36:34.108
(chewing)

36:34.150 --> 36:35.318
Let me try again.

36:35.359 --> 36:36.861
Hmm?
Let me try again.

36:36.903 --> 36:38.654
Okay. Here.

36:38.696 --> 36:40.990
Let me try it with Jesus.

36:49.248 --> 36:51.334
(Murphy breathing softly)

36:52.251 --> 36:53.586
(grunts softly)

36:53.628 --> 36:54.879
(inhales)

36:56.714 --> 36:59.008
Oh, my God. What time is it?

37:02.136 --> 37:03.554
Savannah?

37:04.472 --> 37:05.890
(sighs)

37:07.725 --> 37:09.143
Hey.

37:11.187 --> 37:12.647
Savannah?

37:19.195 --> 37:20.821
(grunts)

37:22.281 --> 37:23.908
Savannah.

37:26.953 --> 37:28.371
Hey.

37:37.213 --> 37:39.298

(chatter in distance)

40:00.398 --> 40:03.067
(door opening)

40:08.823 --> 40:11.534
You said you were
gonna kill me.

40:11.575 --> 40:13.077
I went in there
to kill you.

40:13.119 --> 40:14.495
I really did.

40:14.537 --> 40:15.830
Then I thought,

40:15.871 --> 40:18.249
wouldn't it be fun
if Murphy woke up

40:18.290 --> 40:21.252
to find that nice,
innocent lady dead

40:21.293 --> 40:24.296
and know she was the reason why?

40:25.756 --> 40:28.384
Killing you
is too easy.

40:28.426 --> 40:30.594
I'm gonna
make you suffer.

40:31.095 --> 40:33.806
So, look, you can keep making
your little friends in here,

40:33.848 --> 40:36.475
and I will pick them off
one by one.

40:36.517 --> 40:38.352
And when I get bored
of that...

40:39.353 --> 40:41.105
...kill you, too.

40:42.022 --> 40:43.315
(chuckles softly)

40:44.066 --> 40:47.069
MAN (over walkie):
All channels, all channels...
(alarm wailing)

40:47.111 --> 40:49.613
...we need an emergency sweep,
all cells.

40:49.655 --> 40:50.990
GUARD: There's a dead
inmate in the chapel.
(clamoring)

40:51.031 --> 40:52.408
We need an emergency
sweep of all cells.

40:52.450 --> 40:54.452
(clamoring)

40:54.493 --> 40:56.662
(alarm continues wailing)

41:03.878 --> 41:06.005
(clamoring)

41:21.645 --> 41:23.731
(speaking indistinctly)

41:29.653 --> 41:31.822
(clamoring continues)

41:33.115 --> 41:34.617
INMATE:
Three down!

41:35.534 --> 41:37.161
Down.

41:41.999 --> 41:43.334
One.

41:47.046 --> 41:48.255
Two.

41:49.215 --> 41:50.591
Three.

41:52.092 --> 41:53.552
Can I help you?

41:55.304 --> 41:57.681
I think we can help each other.
