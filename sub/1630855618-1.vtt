WEBVTT

01:10.809 --> 01:12.115
It's Friday,

01:12.115 --> 01:15.423
and it is, of course,
the Muslim prayer day.

01:15.423 --> 01:18.513
Everyone's off,
except for the skeleton staff

01:18.513 --> 01:20.645
at the Bangladeshi Bank,

01:20.645 --> 01:24.562
including Zubair Bin Huda,
who is the duty manager.

01:27.870 --> 01:31.395
He's part of
the elite team of employees

01:31.395 --> 01:35.095
who run
the SWIFT banking system,

01:35.095 --> 01:38.663
which is a highly secure
banking system

01:38.663 --> 01:41.318
that sends money
around the world.

01:43.538 --> 01:47.281
Now, Bin Huda goes,
as he does every day,

01:47.281 --> 01:49.152
to the SWIFT printer

01:49.152 --> 01:53.374
to check up on the transactions
from the day before.

01:53.374 --> 01:56.159
There are usually printouts

01:56.159 --> 01:58.422
of transactions
that came in overnight.

01:58.422 --> 02:02.774
The SWIFT software would print
out a ledger every single day,

02:02.774 --> 02:06.952
an audit trace of every single
transaction that occurred

02:06.952 --> 02:08.693
on paper.

02:08.693 --> 02:11.392
But when they came in
on February 5th morning,

02:11.392 --> 02:12.871
as they usually do,

02:12.871 --> 02:15.744
they found there were
no SWIFT messages at all.

02:15.744 --> 02:20.009
In fact, the printer's
shut down. It won't work.

02:20.009 --> 02:21.358
They try and turn it on.

02:21.358 --> 02:25.188
Nothing will kick it
back into life.

02:25.188 --> 02:28.148
He assumes it was simply
a technical error,

02:28.148 --> 02:30.193
shrugs, goes home for the night,

02:30.193 --> 02:32.282
comes back in
on Saturday morning

02:32.282 --> 02:34.502
to check the system again.

02:35.677 --> 02:36.939
The next day,

02:36.939 --> 02:40.160
they somehow manually
get the printer to work.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.466
This deputy head manager
walks in the room,

02:42.466 --> 02:46.122
the printer starts working, and
these weird messages come out.

02:46.122 --> 02:49.560
The printer
starts spewing out

02:49.560 --> 02:51.736
all of these transactions,

02:51.736 --> 02:56.306
including individual requests
to the Fed in New York

02:56.306 --> 02:59.353
for $1 billion.

03:01.268 --> 03:04.880
At that moment,
it's panic stations.

03:44.789 --> 03:50.230
When I was growing up,
the biggest crime in Britain

03:50.230 --> 03:52.319
ever recorded
was the Great Train Robbery.

03:52.319 --> 03:56.366
It was an extraordinary thing.
They stole about £2.5 million.

03:56.366 --> 03:58.760
That's about $4 million.

03:58.760 --> 04:04.244
And that story
ran literally for 30 years.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.768
Four million dollars.

04:07.856 --> 04:10.293
What you're about to hear

04:10.293 --> 04:14.036
is the story of an attempt
to steal...

04:15.037 --> 04:17.518
a billion dollars

04:18.475 --> 04:20.434
It's told by world-leading

04:20.434 --> 04:23.959
cybersecurity and legal experts
and journalists:

04:23.959 --> 04:26.309
the very people
who uncovered the facts

04:26.309 --> 04:27.919
and threaded them together

04:27.919 --> 04:32.489
to reveal how dangerous the
world of cybercrime is today.

04:49.898 --> 04:53.336
So, there are four big threats

04:53.336 --> 04:57.471
to the world
and to the human race.

04:57.471 --> 04:59.603
One of them
we've just experienced,

04:59.603 --> 05:01.736
that's the pandemic.

05:01.736 --> 05:04.826
Then you've got weapons
of mass destruction.

05:04.826 --> 05:08.220
You've got climate change.

05:08.220 --> 05:13.965
But barrelling down towards us
before those is cyber.

05:24.498 --> 05:25.934
This is the possibility

05:25.934 --> 05:30.068
of our overdependency
on network technologies

05:30.068 --> 05:34.943
being undermined, either by
malfunctioning of the system...

05:34.943 --> 05:36.597
New problems are emerging

05:36.597 --> 05:39.164
the day after an Amazon
web service outage.

05:39.164 --> 05:42.254
Massive and mysterious,
a global outage...

05:42.254 --> 05:45.214
...or by a targeted attack.

05:45.214 --> 05:47.129
More than a thousand companies

05:47.129 --> 05:49.305
have been crippled
by this attack so far.

05:49.305 --> 05:52.264
Sounds like we're looking
at a 2022 with more hacks,

05:52.264 --> 05:53.570
more lost money.

05:59.924 --> 06:04.233
So, when I started hunting
hackers in the early 1990s...

06:05.452 --> 06:07.671
our enemy was really simple.

06:07.671 --> 06:10.152
All the malware,
all the viruses,

06:10.152 --> 06:13.111
all the attacks were
done by teenage boys.

06:13.111 --> 06:15.462
What will your parents think?

06:17.594 --> 06:20.815
I've been doing this job
for two decades now.

06:24.253 --> 06:25.472
When we first started,

06:25.472 --> 06:27.909
the people writing viruses
and malware

06:27.909 --> 06:29.476
were doing it for fun,

06:29.476 --> 06:32.392
to get their name in lights,
to say, "Look what I can do."

06:32.392 --> 06:34.655
No flash, please.

06:34.655 --> 06:37.788
When I started analysing
viruses, they looked like this.

06:37.788 --> 06:41.052
Malware was still spread
on floppy disks.

06:41.052 --> 06:44.708
They were spreading at the speed
of people travelling the world

06:44.708 --> 06:47.102
and carrying the viruses
with them.

06:47.102 --> 06:50.540
Michelangelo has
proven less harmful than feared.

06:50.540 --> 06:53.108
All the stuff you've got
in there you may really want,

06:53.108 --> 06:54.414
it's just gone?

06:54.414 --> 06:56.459
Then the internet came around,
and suddenly,

06:56.459 --> 06:59.331
malware outbreaks could
go around the world in seconds.

06:59.331 --> 07:00.942
For the last 36 hours,

07:00.942 --> 07:04.685
the ILOVEYOU virus has been
creating havoc around the world.

07:04.685 --> 07:08.166
Experts have reason to worry.
The first attack, July 19th,

07:08.166 --> 07:11.648
infected about 300,000
systems in nine hours.

07:11.648 --> 07:14.129
First of all, the guys who
make a living doing security

07:14.129 --> 07:16.044
and are trying to protect themselves

07:16.044 --> 07:19.569
are scared shitless of you,
because you can just ruin 'em.

07:19.569 --> 07:20.875
After the period of time

07:20.875 --> 07:22.529
where hackers
were just doing things for fun,

07:22.529 --> 07:26.010
some of them realised that they
could use it to make money.

07:28.535 --> 07:31.668
Prior to, like, the 2000s...

07:31.668 --> 07:35.716
cyber was primarily around
a disruption of websites...

07:36.630 --> 07:38.893
defacement of a webpage.

07:38.893 --> 07:42.505
Just as we got around 2000,
the dot-com boom, the explosion,

07:42.505 --> 07:44.376
we started into
what would become

07:44.376 --> 07:46.161
financially motivated hackers.

07:46.161 --> 07:49.033
This really flourished,
especially in Eastern European,

07:49.033 --> 07:53.124
Russia, CIS bloc countries.

07:53.124 --> 07:55.953
This was the time
of gangster capitalism,

07:55.953 --> 08:00.001
when everyone's world in Eastern
Europe was falling apart,

08:00.001 --> 08:02.612
where organised crime and...

08:02.612 --> 08:05.528
former members of
the intelligence services

08:05.528 --> 08:09.314
were taking hold
of the economy.

08:10.881 --> 08:14.276
So you had a lot of young people
in the 1990s

08:14.276 --> 08:17.932
who were very good
mathematicians, physicists,

08:17.932 --> 08:20.282
computer scientists,

08:20.282 --> 08:23.503
who simply took
the logic and the morality

08:23.503 --> 08:26.593
of gangster capitalism online.

08:30.074 --> 08:32.163
Virus writers
were writing viruses

08:32.163 --> 08:33.817
to infect Windows computers,

08:33.817 --> 08:36.951
and those computers were then
sold to email spammers,

08:36.951 --> 08:39.954
who were using those machines
to send Viagra spam

08:39.954 --> 08:42.652
or what have you,
basically making money.

08:42.652 --> 08:44.436
And that changed everything.

08:48.789 --> 08:51.574
People at that time
began to use online banking,

08:51.574 --> 08:54.621
and they began to steal people's
online banking credentials,

08:54.621 --> 08:57.275
from there, also get
credit card numbers,

08:57.275 --> 08:59.408
and use that
to basically transfer funds.

08:59.408 --> 09:02.672
Just in hundreds of dollars at
a time from these individuals.

09:02.672 --> 09:05.893
They eventually realised
that going after individuals

09:05.893 --> 09:07.198
was much more difficult

09:07.198 --> 09:10.288
than just going after
the banks themselves.

09:10.288 --> 09:11.942
Get into databases,

09:11.942 --> 09:14.423
those databases held
credit card numbers.

09:14.423 --> 09:17.600
Take those numbers and then
sell them on the black market.

09:19.341 --> 09:23.345
Originally, the internet
was set up at the Pentagon...

09:25.042 --> 09:29.003
just to be able to share
resources between computers.

09:32.136 --> 09:35.226
And it was really never
designed to have

09:35.226 --> 09:38.490
banking attached to it,

09:38.490 --> 09:41.711
critical infrastructure
attached to it.

09:41.711 --> 09:44.366
It was really designed
for availability.

09:44.366 --> 09:47.108
It was never designed
for security.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.502
Whereas in the early 1990s

09:50.502 --> 09:53.505
when there was only 30,000
people connected to it

09:53.505 --> 09:56.813
and several hundred systems,
we've moved to a system

09:56.813 --> 09:59.947
which essentially is the
backbone of global finance.

10:01.339 --> 10:04.560
The fact that
it's able to do that...

10:04.560 --> 10:07.432
the fact that it's able
to sustain currently between

10:07.432 --> 10:10.392
15 and 20 percent
of GDP globally

10:10.392 --> 10:12.742
tells us something about
just how important

10:12.742 --> 10:14.918
this infrastructure is.

10:14.918 --> 10:17.094
Why did people move
into the internet

10:17.094 --> 10:18.661
to seek economic opportunity?

10:18.661 --> 10:21.621
Because that's where the
economic opportunity was,

10:21.621 --> 10:23.579
untethered by norms,

10:23.579 --> 10:25.799
untethered
by national boundaries,

10:25.799 --> 10:28.497
and essentially limited
only by the creativity

10:28.497 --> 10:30.194
that these individuals had.

10:40.814 --> 10:43.817
The user nagged
the Federal Reserve Bank

10:43.817 --> 10:48.386
with 35 payment instructions
worth $951 million.

10:48.386 --> 10:50.867
We'd just never heard
of such a thing before.

10:50.867 --> 10:53.043
We'd been investigating cybercrime

10:53.043 --> 10:55.567
for a couple of decades
at that point.

10:55.567 --> 10:57.700
You see cyber criminals go in,

10:57.700 --> 11:01.748
and they try to transfer a few
hundred thousands of dollars,

11:01.748 --> 11:05.055
maybe a million,
a couple of million.

11:05.055 --> 11:09.059
But conducting a cyber-attack
to try to steal one billion?

11:09.059 --> 11:13.020
That was an order of magnitude
that we had never seen before.

11:13.020 --> 11:14.674
It was clear from early on

11:14.674 --> 11:18.112
that it was one of the biggest
cyber heists in the world.

11:18.112 --> 11:20.505
When we first started
hearing rumours

11:20.505 --> 11:23.813
about something affecting
SWIFT network,

11:23.813 --> 11:26.424
I didn't understand
how big it was.

11:26.424 --> 11:28.122
But when we started realising

11:28.122 --> 11:30.646
this is at a completely
different scale,

11:30.646 --> 11:32.561
it just blew my mind.

11:46.314 --> 11:47.445
Once they realised

11:47.445 --> 11:49.578
that the money actually
was really gone,

11:49.578 --> 11:51.623
then the panic began to set in.

11:51.623 --> 11:56.890
They lost $81 million instantly
to a bank in the Philippines.

11:56.890 --> 11:59.980
They see the $81 million
has already gone

11:59.980 --> 12:05.855
and that nearly $900 million
extra has been requested.

12:08.815 --> 12:13.254
They basically try to figure out
what to do next.

12:13.254 --> 12:15.865
They have no idea what to do.

12:15.865 --> 12:19.129
They hunted for ways to contact
the New York Fed.

12:20.957 --> 12:23.655
Desperate calls are made
by them.

12:27.834 --> 12:29.749
And it goes
to an answering machine.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.751
<i>You've reached
the Federal Reserve Bank...</i>

12:31.751 --> 12:33.622
Because it's Saturday
in New York,

12:33.622 --> 12:36.016
and nobody's picking
up the phone.

12:36.016 --> 12:39.106
<i>- Please call back...</i>
- It's a complete shitshow.

12:39.106 --> 12:43.153
Total disorganisation,
at both ends, I would stress.

12:45.503 --> 12:49.246
<i>The New York Times Magazine</i>
was planning a true-crime issue,

12:49.246 --> 12:50.421
and my editor came to me

12:50.421 --> 12:52.902
and asked I was interested
in doing it.

12:54.251 --> 12:55.600
I looked into it a bit.

12:55.600 --> 12:58.125
There definitely were
some intriguing elements,

12:58.125 --> 12:59.779
and made me pay attention.

13:02.129 --> 13:04.435
The Federal Reserve
has pretty much

13:04.435 --> 13:07.177
depended on the SWIFT
banking system,

13:07.177 --> 13:11.878
and since there has rarely
been a hack, if ever,

13:11.878 --> 13:14.837
of the SWIFT banking system...

13:14.837 --> 13:18.058
the Federal Reserve
has never instituted

13:18.058 --> 13:20.800
any sort of 24-7 hotline.

13:22.540 --> 13:26.501
Eventually, they get
hold of somebody at SWIFT,

13:26.501 --> 13:28.155
and SWIFT says,

13:28.155 --> 13:29.765
"Just shut the whole lot down

13:29.765 --> 13:32.507
until we know
what's going on here."

13:32.507 --> 13:36.163
Badrul Khan decides before he
can actually make that decision,

13:36.163 --> 13:39.166
he has to talk to the deputy
governor of the bank,

13:39.166 --> 13:40.820
which he does.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.823
Deputy governor doesn't want to
take the decision upon himself,

13:43.823 --> 13:47.435
so he talks to the governor.
And guess what.

13:47.435 --> 13:50.655
The governor says,
"It's probably a mistake.

13:50.655 --> 13:52.614
We won't shut it down."

13:56.009 --> 13:58.750
Work week begins
at the Bangladesh Bank

13:58.750 --> 14:00.187
on Sunday morning,

14:00.187 --> 14:02.972
and it's then that the general
manager of the bank

14:02.972 --> 14:05.845
comes in and begins to take
stock of what had happened.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.411
They're running out of options.

14:07.411 --> 14:11.111
They're not sure what to do.
Fed is still closed in New York.

14:11.111 --> 14:13.200
They go through
all the SWIFT material,

14:13.200 --> 14:16.072
discover that most of
the money has gone

14:16.072 --> 14:18.205
to the bank in Manila.

14:18.205 --> 14:21.164
And these desperate
messages are sent out:

14:21.164 --> 14:22.600
"Stop the transactions.

14:22.600 --> 14:25.168
Hold that money. Do not
allow it to be withdrawn.

14:25.168 --> 14:27.127
It's our money.
It's been stolen."

14:28.650 --> 14:30.260
But there's a problem.

14:30.260 --> 14:32.219
Five, four,

14:32.219 --> 14:35.135
three, two, one!

14:35.135 --> 14:37.920
Happy New Year!

14:41.924 --> 14:43.795
It's Chinese New Year,

14:43.795 --> 14:46.929
and the Rizal Commercial Bank
is closed.

14:51.673 --> 14:56.199
The thieves chose
a sequence of days...

14:56.199 --> 15:00.638
from Friday, Saturday,
Sunday and Monday,

15:00.638 --> 15:03.815
when one or another
of the three countries

15:03.815 --> 15:06.557
that would be communicating
with one another

15:06.557 --> 15:09.169
was shut down for a holiday.

15:15.566 --> 15:17.612
You've got to hand it
to these guys.

15:17.612 --> 15:19.005
They knew it.

15:19.005 --> 15:21.703
They knew that if they did it
over that weekend,

15:21.703 --> 15:23.966
with the Friday,
the Muslim holiday,

15:23.966 --> 15:27.187
the Sunday and the Saturday,
everything closed in New York,

15:27.187 --> 15:30.538
and the Monday,
Chinese New Year.

15:32.322 --> 15:37.110
They've got four days
to get the heist done.

15:37.110 --> 15:39.373
This is really classy planning.

15:41.375 --> 15:45.422
In that respect,
it was really an ingenious plan.

15:45.422 --> 15:49.426
It's kind of like a great film
director in a malevolent way,

15:49.426 --> 15:53.082
planning out, you know,
a very complex film.

15:56.433 --> 15:58.131
The country of Bangladesh

15:58.131 --> 16:01.873
is the 170th poorest country
in the world.

16:01.873 --> 16:04.267
One billion dollars
is huge to them.

16:04.267 --> 16:06.356
When we talk
about cyber-attacks,

16:06.356 --> 16:08.054
they're not just zeros and ones.

16:08.054 --> 16:10.186
We're not just talking
about people

16:10.186 --> 16:13.755
moving around zeros and ones,
deleting zeros and ones.

16:15.539 --> 16:18.107
One billion dollars
to Bangladesh

16:18.107 --> 16:21.545
potentially means that people
starve in the country.

16:21.545 --> 16:25.245
These things have potential
serious repercussions.

16:27.725 --> 16:30.206
The Bangladesh Bank
heist was significant

16:30.206 --> 16:34.297
because it showed how fragile
global banking was as a whole.

16:36.169 --> 16:40.260
Banks don't just operate
as single isolated entities.

16:40.260 --> 16:42.784
They're part of a system.

16:42.784 --> 16:45.482
And that system is vulnerable.

16:47.702 --> 16:52.402
The US Federal Reserve holds
trillions of dollars in accounts

16:52.402 --> 16:55.579
kept by central banks
all around the world.

16:55.579 --> 16:59.279
Its computer security systems
are state of the art, making it

16:59.279 --> 17:03.587
one of the most difficult
financial institutions to hack.

17:07.287 --> 17:10.551
The criminals realise
that it can't get into

17:10.551 --> 17:14.076
the network system of the Fed,

17:14.076 --> 17:17.906
but the Fed has to talk
to other central banks

17:17.906 --> 17:19.777
around the world,

17:19.777 --> 17:23.390
and this is
where they find a flaw.

17:25.305 --> 17:27.437
The criminals turn
their attention

17:27.437 --> 17:30.440
to the banks'
communication systems.

17:31.963 --> 17:35.402
Every day, the Fed places
thousands of transactions

17:35.402 --> 17:39.058
on behalf of the central banks
that hold US dollar reserves

17:39.058 --> 17:40.320
at the Fed.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.757
The Federal Reserve
has pretty much depended

17:42.757 --> 17:45.107
on the SWIFT banking system

17:45.107 --> 17:48.067
to get its instructions
about transfers.

17:48.067 --> 17:51.026
SWIFT sends money
around the world

17:51.026 --> 17:52.941
to thousands of member banks.

17:52.941 --> 17:57.946
It's the main way that banks
dispatch money to one another.

17:59.165 --> 18:01.602
SWIFT allows you
to transfer money

18:01.602 --> 18:02.777
from one bank to another,

18:02.777 --> 18:04.561
no matter where you are
in the world.

18:04.561 --> 18:07.347
Make international
wire transfers.

18:07.347 --> 18:11.568
The whole banking system
is integrated,

18:11.568 --> 18:15.659
and they depend
above all else on SWIFT,

18:15.659 --> 18:21.143
the international transaction
mechanisms, to work.

18:21.143 --> 18:23.319
What it means is,
all it takes

18:23.319 --> 18:28.803
is a single weak link
to bring down the whole network.

18:30.370 --> 18:33.373
So although the target
is the Fed,

18:33.373 --> 18:37.725
they are looking for a bank
with which the Fed communicates,

18:37.725 --> 18:42.338
which holds a lot
of its reserves in New York.

18:42.338 --> 18:44.123
But it's a long way away,

18:44.123 --> 18:48.562
in a distant time zone
from the Fed,

18:48.562 --> 18:51.304
and it's likely to have

18:51.304 --> 18:56.396
patchy security systems in place
in its computer network.

18:58.963 --> 19:00.791
My colleagues in Dhaka,

19:00.791 --> 19:04.012
they were chasing it
for a long time.

19:04.012 --> 19:07.450
It was a robbery of a scale
that we hadn't heard of.

19:09.235 --> 19:11.585
The first thought
that came to my mind was,

19:11.585 --> 19:14.631
because it was the
Bangladeshi Central Bank,

19:14.631 --> 19:17.243
I thought the hackers found it

19:17.243 --> 19:19.549
somehow easier to target it.

19:19.549 --> 19:21.377
Because it was Bangladesh,

19:21.377 --> 19:24.424
I suspected they would
be more vulnerable

19:24.424 --> 19:26.774
to cyber-attacks as such.

19:28.515 --> 19:31.344
"Hmm. A Bangladeshi bank.

19:31.344 --> 19:33.998
Probably doesn't have
the same level of security

19:33.998 --> 19:36.218
and if they do,
it's probably one or two people,

19:36.218 --> 19:40.222
not a team of 6,000
working on it.

19:41.136 --> 19:42.355
Let's go for it."

19:42.355 --> 19:44.661
These attackers
weren't just skilled

19:44.661 --> 19:45.923
in breaching networks,

19:45.923 --> 19:47.838
figuring out how
to get into an organisation.

19:47.838 --> 19:52.016
They had to study that
SWIFT software deeply.

19:52.016 --> 19:55.194
This attack happened
well before that February 5th,

19:55.194 --> 19:56.847
when the bank employee walked in

19:56.847 --> 19:59.894
and saw that printer hadn't
printed out the audit jobs

19:59.894 --> 20:01.939
and couldn't figure out
what was going on.

20:01.939 --> 20:04.812
This attack started more
than a year prior to that.

20:04.812 --> 20:07.293
These attackers had been
working for months

20:07.293 --> 20:09.120
in the build-up until that day.

20:09.120 --> 20:11.253
It is a mistake
for people to think

20:11.253 --> 20:13.560
that this was something
that happened overnight.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.649
It is a mistake
for people to think

20:15.649 --> 20:18.956
that this happened in a month,
or two months or three months.

20:18.956 --> 20:21.394
It is a slow,
methodical approach,

20:21.394 --> 20:25.528
because it's a business,
all right? You build it.

20:32.274 --> 20:35.146
Bank robberies used to be
something that happened

20:35.146 --> 20:37.497
in the real world.

20:37.497 --> 20:40.630
Now they only happen
in the online world.

20:42.806 --> 20:46.767
If you would try to steal
$100 million in banknotes,

20:46.767 --> 20:49.160
that would be, like,
ten trucks full of notes.

20:49.160 --> 20:51.511
If you drive ten trucks
full of notes out of the bank,

20:51.511 --> 20:54.035
someone would notice.

20:54.035 --> 20:57.299
But when you do the same thing
online, no one notices anything.

20:57.299 --> 21:01.042
Every movie you've ever seen
of them breaking into a bank

21:01.042 --> 21:03.436
is them doing it
over a bank holiday

21:03.436 --> 21:05.394
or something of that nature.

21:05.394 --> 21:07.222
Same concept here.

21:12.096 --> 21:15.361
This isn't Matthew Broderick
sitting in front of a computer,

21:15.361 --> 21:17.450
like <i>War Games</i>
back in the 1980s,

21:17.450 --> 21:19.321
some kid in their basement.

21:21.105 --> 21:24.370
These are
criminal organisations.

21:24.370 --> 21:26.023
Each person has a skill set.

21:26.023 --> 21:29.070
It's kind of like that
<i>Ocean's Eleven</i>-type thing.

21:30.593 --> 21:33.074
You know,
"This guy could crack the bank,

21:33.074 --> 21:35.337
this guy could do
the surveillance cameras,

21:35.337 --> 21:37.774
this is the getaway,
this is the conman."

21:37.774 --> 21:39.559
You all have a role to play,

21:39.559 --> 21:42.301
and you need everybody
to execute their role

21:42.301 --> 21:44.085
to the best of their abilities

21:44.085 --> 21:46.870
for you to be
successful and get it out.

21:48.742 --> 21:53.007
So how do you pull off
a heist of this magnitude?

21:53.007 --> 21:58.317
It takes the right crew of
highly skilled specialists.

21:58.317 --> 22:03.191
And it all starts not with ones
and zeros, but with people.

22:07.151 --> 22:10.590
Cybercrime is about
gaining credentials

22:10.590 --> 22:12.635
to gain access,

22:12.635 --> 22:15.421
stealing the keys.

22:15.421 --> 22:19.816
The social engineer
is critical to a hack.

22:19.816 --> 22:22.253
It's how you get in,
and you get in

22:22.253 --> 22:26.388
not through digital means,
you get in through human means.

22:26.388 --> 22:28.956
It's to do with psychology.

22:31.306 --> 22:35.528
The criminals have to ensnare
one of the employees

22:35.528 --> 22:38.052
of the Bangladeshi Bank,

22:38.052 --> 22:41.882
beginning by going through
their social media profiles

22:41.882 --> 22:44.711
and looking
for suitable targets.

22:45.929 --> 22:48.932
Our relationship
with the computer

22:48.932 --> 22:51.848
is one of perceived intimacy;

22:51.848 --> 22:54.373
that when we're using
a computer,

22:54.373 --> 22:57.767
no one else can see
what we're doing, we believe,

22:57.767 --> 23:00.379
and it's just us and the screen.

23:02.119 --> 23:05.819
And if we were to read
an email from a friend,

23:05.819 --> 23:08.909
we tend to believe it
at face value.

23:12.216 --> 23:15.219
They found
close to three dozen employees.

23:15.219 --> 23:18.832
And they constructed
a simple spear-phish email:

23:18.832 --> 23:21.748
an email message that pretended
to be from a guy

23:21.748 --> 23:24.446
named Rasal Alam.

23:24.446 --> 23:26.056
And Rasal Alam said,

23:26.056 --> 23:28.581
"Hey, I just wanna
work at your company.

23:28.581 --> 23:31.410
Here's a résumé attached.
Have a look."

23:31.410 --> 23:34.108
And it turned out
that they mailed that

23:34.108 --> 23:36.893
to about 36 different employees,
and three of them

23:36.893 --> 23:39.722
opened that attachment
connected to that email.

23:40.984 --> 23:42.333
It was a zip file,

23:42.333 --> 23:44.640
and the zip file contained
just a document inside.

23:44.640 --> 23:47.295
They opened up the document
and it was his résumé.

23:47.295 --> 23:50.733
It was a résumé for Rasel Ahlam,
who wanted to work at the bank,

23:50.733 --> 23:52.996
but unbeknownst
to those individuals,

23:52.996 --> 23:56.826
also contained
malicious code inside.

23:56.826 --> 23:58.741
We can look at any data breach,

23:58.741 --> 24:01.222
and the root cause
has either been

24:01.222 --> 24:03.311
a technical problem

24:03.311 --> 24:05.400
or a people problem.

24:05.400 --> 24:08.229
And the technical problems
can be really hard

24:08.229 --> 24:10.536
and really expensive
and really slow to fix,

24:10.536 --> 24:12.581
but at least we can fix them.

24:12.581 --> 24:16.150
But in the end, we have
no patch for human brains.

24:17.804 --> 24:22.243
There's no way to fix the people
who do stupid mistakes.

24:22.243 --> 24:23.723
When attackers try to send

24:23.723 --> 24:27.030
these spear-phishing emails,
they try to do two things.

24:27.030 --> 24:30.512
They try to look very normal.
It was just a résumé.

24:30.512 --> 24:31.818
They try to fly under the radar,

24:31.818 --> 24:33.515
to look as legitimate
as possible.

24:33.515 --> 24:37.476
And the second is they often
try to use enticing techniques.

24:43.612 --> 24:47.050
New dangers tonight from
the Love Bug computer virus,

24:47.050 --> 24:49.966
this time disguised
as a friendlier email.

24:49.966 --> 24:53.579
The first internet virus
that went around the world

24:53.579 --> 24:57.887
in less than 48 hours was
called the ILOVEYOU virus.

24:57.887 --> 25:00.499
And already,
business interruption costs

25:00.499 --> 25:03.676
are estimated at more than
a billion dollars.

25:03.676 --> 25:06.592
You would be sitting
there working away,

25:06.592 --> 25:08.507
and then suddenly,
in your inbox,

25:08.507 --> 25:12.554
you get an email which says,
"I love you."

25:12.554 --> 25:15.252
And it could well be
that this is a person

25:15.252 --> 25:17.820
who you've always
held a torch for.

25:17.820 --> 25:20.344
And so, of course,
you're very excited,

25:20.344 --> 25:24.087
and you press on the link,
and then you're doomed.

25:24.087 --> 25:26.873
What happens is,
the virus infects your machine

25:26.873 --> 25:29.963
and proceeds to email everyone
you've ever emailed.

25:29.963 --> 25:32.618
The end result of that
is the mail servers

25:32.618 --> 25:33.706
get bogged down,

25:33.706 --> 25:36.143
and the only way
to solve the problem

25:36.143 --> 25:39.276
is to shut the servers down,
hence the interruption.

25:39.276 --> 25:42.323
The ILOVEYOU virus
was one of the first viruses

25:42.323 --> 25:45.065
that had really
worldwide impact.

25:47.110 --> 25:49.722
It was still a virus
written by a guy

25:49.722 --> 25:52.594
that just wanted to get
his name in lights.

25:52.594 --> 25:53.813
He wanted to see his virus

25:53.813 --> 25:55.597
travel around the world
a little bit

25:55.597 --> 25:57.381
and maybe get
in the news somewhere,

25:57.381 --> 25:59.819
and then him be able to say,
"Oh, I wrote that."

25:59.819 --> 26:03.083
Mr de Guzman hardly
seemed to comprehend the chaos

26:03.083 --> 26:05.041
inflicted on
the world's computers.

26:05.041 --> 26:08.610
But what happened was, it
spread so quickly and so fast,

26:08.610 --> 26:11.265
it brought down email
all over the world,

26:11.265 --> 26:13.920
and having email go down
was monumental.

26:13.920 --> 26:17.358
Experts say that the ILOVEYOU
virus could end up costing

26:17.358 --> 26:21.580
the world economy $10 billion
in lost work time.

26:21.580 --> 26:25.627
It became the first sign to show
that we relied on the internet.

26:25.627 --> 26:29.196
The internet was the basis for
our financial transactions,

26:29.196 --> 26:31.154
for the way we do business.

26:32.460 --> 26:33.635
I would talk to people

26:33.635 --> 26:35.332
and remind them
and educate them and say,

26:35.332 --> 26:36.899
"Look, you can't just click

26:36.899 --> 26:39.380
on any attachment
that comes to you in an email."

26:39.380 --> 26:42.818
I remember talking to a guy
about the Anna Kournikova virus

26:42.818 --> 26:45.995
that purported to be nude
pictures of Anna Kournikova.

26:45.995 --> 26:48.955
And he told me, he said,
"Yeah, I knew it was a virus.

26:48.955 --> 26:52.088
I thought it was probably
a virus. But what if it wasn't?

26:52.088 --> 26:53.960
What if it really was
nude pictures?

26:53.960 --> 26:55.788
So I double-clicked on it."

26:56.919 --> 26:58.399
People just don't realise

26:58.399 --> 27:02.055
what clicking on that
attachment means.

27:02.055 --> 27:06.102
Cyber criminals and hackers
realised a long time ago

27:06.102 --> 27:09.018
that your username and password,

27:09.018 --> 27:11.804
particularly to
your email account,

27:11.804 --> 27:15.285
could get them into your
stock brokerage account,

27:15.285 --> 27:18.201
to your online
banking account,

27:18.201 --> 27:23.903
to send phishing emails
to other contacts.

27:23.903 --> 27:27.994
If you protect
yourself properly,

27:27.994 --> 27:31.214
the chances are
you won't be a victim

27:31.214 --> 27:35.218
of what one would call
"drive-by hacking".

27:35.218 --> 27:39.483
If, however, you're being
specifically targeted

27:39.483 --> 27:42.965
by a hacking group,
they will follow that trace.

27:43.879 --> 27:45.533
And they will get you.

27:48.449 --> 27:53.280
Now, we know that at least three
members of the Bangladeshi Bank

27:53.280 --> 27:56.587
were targeted by this after
the social engineer

27:56.587 --> 27:58.981
had scanned
all of their social media,

27:58.981 --> 28:00.722
and at least three of them

28:00.722 --> 28:04.073
opened the letter
and took the bait.

28:04.073 --> 28:06.249
Once that code
began executing

28:06.249 --> 28:08.295
on those bank employees'
computers,

28:08.295 --> 28:10.906
it would reach out back
to the attackers

28:10.906 --> 28:13.866
and tell them that
these machines are now infected

28:13.866 --> 28:15.302
and give them full control,

28:15.302 --> 28:18.044
as if they were sitting
in front of the keyboard,

28:18.044 --> 28:21.134
just like those employees.

28:21.134 --> 28:23.745
There was malware
in the system

28:23.745 --> 28:26.574
that was actually
copying screenshots,

28:28.358 --> 28:33.450
copying keystrokes of employees,
and no one knew.

28:33.450 --> 28:35.801
They've got
their foot in the door.

28:35.801 --> 28:38.760
This is the essential
first step.

28:38.760 --> 28:42.677
The first layer of security
has been breached.

28:48.639 --> 28:52.339
And the digger, the person who
is getting deeper and deeper

28:52.339 --> 28:54.558
into the computer network,

28:54.558 --> 28:58.258
has to be a very
advanced hacker.

28:58.258 --> 29:02.958
This is when you need
a real professional.

29:02.958 --> 29:05.656
They're like ghosts.
Nobody can see them,

29:05.656 --> 29:10.009
but they're mapping every
single bit of that network.

29:11.967 --> 29:13.577
In the Bank of Bangladesh,

29:13.577 --> 29:16.145
you had computers that are all
interconnected to each other,

29:16.145 --> 29:19.279
and they're connected
using what's called a switch.

29:19.279 --> 29:23.022
In your average bank, that has
a good security program,

29:23.022 --> 29:25.676
those switches are
what's called segmented.

29:25.676 --> 29:27.591
So each of those switches
only allow

29:27.591 --> 29:30.290
a certain number of computers
to talk to each other

29:30.290 --> 29:32.814
rather than every computer
to talk to each other.

29:32.814 --> 29:35.382
But in the case of
the Bank of Bangladesh,

29:35.382 --> 29:38.559
in the back-office network, they
were using these very cheap,

29:38.559 --> 29:42.084
literally $10 switches
that didn't do any segmentation.

29:42.084 --> 29:45.348
Every computer was potentially
connected to each other.

29:45.348 --> 29:48.308
Basically,
it's a cost-cutting exercise.

29:48.308 --> 29:53.530
But that cost-cutting exercise
was what the digger needed.

29:53.530 --> 29:55.489
Those attackers
began to do

29:55.489 --> 29:58.231
what we call a lateral traverse
across the network,

29:58.231 --> 30:01.147
search for other computers
to infect,

30:01.147 --> 30:03.062
look for credentials.

30:04.585 --> 30:06.848
Whenever you log
into a computer,

30:06.848 --> 30:08.676
your credentials are cached.

30:08.676 --> 30:11.331
They're put into the memory
of the computer.

30:11.331 --> 30:14.290
Attackers are able
to filter through that memory

30:14.290 --> 30:16.640
and find used usernames
and passwords.

30:16.640 --> 30:19.469
They don't always know
what they're for,

30:19.469 --> 30:22.385
so they try to collect as many
credentials as they can

30:22.385 --> 30:25.432
and see, "What computers can
I see from this computer?",

30:25.432 --> 30:27.608
and just begin to use them
over and over again

30:27.608 --> 30:28.652
and just try them.

30:31.264 --> 30:32.613
Eventually, they hop on

30:32.613 --> 30:35.050
and are able to connect
to another computer.

30:35.050 --> 30:36.312
They get onto that one.

30:36.312 --> 30:38.271
It's still not what
they're interested in,

30:38.271 --> 30:40.664
but they're able to find more
usernames and passwords

30:40.664 --> 30:42.405
and try those
on all the other computers

30:42.405 --> 30:44.190
they can see
from that advantage point.

30:44.190 --> 30:48.020
That's how they move across
the network over and over again.

30:48.020 --> 30:50.544
They would delete
all traces of themselves

30:50.544 --> 30:52.894
as they moved
across the network,

30:52.894 --> 30:55.636
ultimately jumping from
computer to computer

30:55.636 --> 30:57.681
until they found
the SWIFT terminal,

30:57.681 --> 31:00.815
their ultimate goal in order
to make wire transfers

31:00.815 --> 31:02.817
out of the Bank of Bangladesh.

31:04.993 --> 31:06.777
It takes a long time.

31:06.777 --> 31:10.172
They're there for months.
This is an ongoing process.

31:10.172 --> 31:14.220
If at any moment they're
discovered to be in there,

31:14.220 --> 31:18.137
then the whole
operation is finished.

31:22.141 --> 31:24.056
With the Bangladeshi Bank heist,

31:24.056 --> 31:27.276
you basically have two
operations running in parallel.

31:27.276 --> 31:29.670
You have an offline operation
going on,

31:29.670 --> 31:32.238
which is to do with
the money laundering.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.940
It's the fence's responsibility

31:38.940 --> 31:43.902
to set up
the recipient accounts.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.382
They're gonna end up
with cold, hard cash,

31:46.382 --> 31:48.080
and they need individuals
on the ground

31:48.080 --> 31:50.909
to pick up that cash
and move it.

31:53.172 --> 31:54.434
And so, in May of 2015,

31:54.434 --> 31:56.871
before they'd even got
into the SWIFT terminal,

31:56.871 --> 31:59.656
they were able to recruit
a Chinese individual

31:59.656 --> 32:03.312
to go to the Philippines and
open up four bank accounts there

32:03.312 --> 32:05.227
at a bank called RCBC.

32:05.227 --> 32:08.883
You have to make sure
those people inside the bank

32:08.883 --> 32:10.711
in the Philippines

32:10.711 --> 32:12.974
have been properly corrupted

32:12.974 --> 32:17.674
and properly instructed
as to what their role is.

32:17.674 --> 32:20.068
The fence opens up
these accounts,

32:20.068 --> 32:22.592
puts $500 in each of them,

32:22.592 --> 32:25.726
and then they just go to sleep
for nine months.

32:28.598 --> 32:31.950
These attackers were
inside the Bank of Bangladesh

32:31.950 --> 32:34.822
for a full year,
which is incredible.

32:41.307 --> 32:43.265
They actually got
onto that SWIFT terminal

32:43.265 --> 32:44.788
exactly one year later...

32:47.617 --> 32:50.229
on January 29th, 2016.

32:55.495 --> 32:58.019
In any bank,
you have different employees.

32:58.019 --> 33:01.414
You have back-office employees,
administrative employees,

33:01.414 --> 33:04.330
but you also have computers
that are connected

33:04.330 --> 33:07.159
directly to
financial transactions.

33:07.159 --> 33:11.076
And only users who have specific
access to those machines

33:11.076 --> 33:12.555
are allowed to use them.

33:12.555 --> 33:15.036
When we talk about the case of
the Bank of Bangladesh,

33:15.036 --> 33:18.605
there was a single computer
that had credentials

33:18.605 --> 33:20.085
from a shared employee.

33:20.085 --> 33:23.218
You had an employee that
would use that SWIFT terminal,

33:23.218 --> 33:26.830
but also had their own computer
in the normal back-office area.

33:26.830 --> 33:29.355
Once they got onto
that employee's computer,

33:29.355 --> 33:31.052
they were able to jump across.

33:31.052 --> 33:34.969
They waited. They basically
did a recon on the system.

33:34.969 --> 33:36.579
They crawled around.

33:36.579 --> 33:39.756
They looked and tried to fully
understand how this worked,

33:39.756 --> 33:43.804
how SWIFT worked, how each bank
employee would make a request

33:43.804 --> 33:47.155
into the SWIFT system,
where it would go,

33:47.155 --> 33:49.244
how to direct that to branches

33:49.244 --> 33:52.117
where they had set up
these accounts.

33:52.117 --> 33:55.729
And in this case, it was just
very simple and very clever.

33:58.166 --> 34:00.342
The thief is
not so much someone

34:00.342 --> 34:03.302
who is physically
taking out the money

34:03.302 --> 34:05.695
and stuffing it into a bag.

34:05.695 --> 34:07.610
They're making sure

34:07.610 --> 34:12.572
that every bit on the system
is coordinated.

34:12.572 --> 34:16.228
There are all sorts of things
to get right

34:16.228 --> 34:21.494
before that fatal moment
when the request is made.

34:21.494 --> 34:24.105
Everything has to be

34:24.105 --> 34:26.716
really, really
precisely coordinated

34:26.716 --> 34:29.937
to get all the timing right.
You've got four days.

34:29.937 --> 34:31.547
You can't afford a slip-up.

34:31.547 --> 34:34.333
When the attackers
got into the SWIFT terminal

34:34.333 --> 34:38.728
on January 29th of 2016,
they paused for about five days

34:38.728 --> 34:41.079
to get their malicious
software ready

34:41.079 --> 34:43.168
that allowed them
to cover their tracks

34:43.168 --> 34:45.257
when they were on
that SWIFT terminal.

34:45.257 --> 34:48.173
They decided to wait
until February 4th.

34:48.173 --> 34:49.826
And this is no accident.

34:52.960 --> 34:55.702
They have chosen
a long weekend

34:55.702 --> 34:58.574
due to holidays in different
parts of the world.

34:58.574 --> 35:01.186
That means,
instead of the usual two days

35:01.186 --> 35:02.535
they have to get away with it

35:02.535 --> 35:04.841
before alarms
start going off everywhere,

35:04.841 --> 35:07.931
they've got four days.
It's brilliant.

35:09.498 --> 35:11.935
February 4th, 2016,
was a Thursday.

35:11.935 --> 35:14.634
That's the last day of
the working week in Bangladesh.

35:14.634 --> 35:16.940
In Bangladesh, they work
from Sunday to Thursday.

35:16.940 --> 35:19.421
So, at some point late
in the afternoon,

35:19.421 --> 35:22.685
the SWIFT transaction operator
in the Bangladeshi Bank

35:22.685 --> 35:24.687
logs off his terminal.

35:28.778 --> 35:30.476
But three hours later,

35:30.476 --> 35:33.435
the thief logs into
that terminal

35:33.435 --> 35:35.829
and starts to impersonate him.

35:35.829 --> 35:38.919
They logged into that SWIFT
terminal at 8:36 p.m.,

35:38.919 --> 35:41.051
after they believed,
or really knew,

35:41.051 --> 35:44.403
that all the bank employees
had gone home for the weekend.

35:44.403 --> 35:48.233
And they put forward
35 different wire transactions

35:48.233 --> 35:52.280
from that SWIFT terminal,
totalling $951 million,

35:52.280 --> 35:55.631
almost $1 billion,
completely unheard of.

35:58.678 --> 36:02.029
Ten hours
behind Bangladesh,

36:02.029 --> 36:03.813
New York is waking up.

36:04.945 --> 36:07.252
The first thing
that the Fed sees

36:07.252 --> 36:09.297
is 35 requests

36:09.297 --> 36:13.214
for almost the entire holdings
of the Bangladeshi Bank.

36:13.214 --> 36:17.523
Usually, it's figures of sort
of $300,000, $500,000.

36:17.523 --> 36:19.525
They want almost a billion!

36:19.525 --> 36:23.746
The operator, perhaps
unsurprisingly, rejects it,

36:23.746 --> 36:26.488
sends it back to Bangladesh.

36:26.488 --> 36:28.751
But he rejects it not because

36:28.751 --> 36:32.581
this is an absolutely crazy
amount of money,

36:32.581 --> 36:36.585
but because the requests
are wrongly formatted.

36:36.585 --> 36:39.153
As much research
that they had done,

36:39.153 --> 36:41.851
they didn't really understand
how to fill out

36:41.851 --> 36:43.331
those SWIFT transfers.

36:43.331 --> 36:45.942
They were missing what's called
an intermediate bank.

36:45.942 --> 36:48.162
New York Federal Reserve
replied to them,

36:48.162 --> 36:50.469
via the SWIFT system,
back to their computer

36:50.469 --> 36:52.688
that they were sitting
in front of, virtually,

36:52.688 --> 36:56.475
saying, "Hey, these transactions
are missing information."

36:56.475 --> 36:58.520
They think on their feet.

36:58.520 --> 37:02.829
They reformat the requests,
send them back...

37:02.829 --> 37:06.006
and hold their breath
to see what happens.

37:06.006 --> 37:08.574
They ultimately corrected
34 of them.

37:08.574 --> 37:09.879
They had forgotten one.

37:09.879 --> 37:12.230
The one did have
the intermediate bank

37:12.230 --> 37:13.448
went to Deutsche Bank.

37:13.448 --> 37:15.581
That order was for $20 million

37:15.581 --> 37:19.802
to a charity called the Shalika
Foundation in Sri Lanka.

37:19.802 --> 37:22.109
But they had made
a typo as well,

37:22.109 --> 37:25.417
and they had misspelled
"foundation" as "fandation".

37:25.417 --> 37:27.680
And so Deutsche Bank
saw that typo

37:27.680 --> 37:29.856
and questioned it and, again,

37:29.856 --> 37:32.293
held that transaction
due to that typo.

37:34.643 --> 37:36.863
We use that
as the poster child

37:36.863 --> 37:40.083
for why you need
to learn how to spell.

37:40.083 --> 37:43.783
Otherwise, you can lose
$20 million.

37:43.783 --> 37:47.265
Ultimately, when
they return the other 34...

37:48.570 --> 37:50.268
Bingo.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.487
The operator approves them.

37:52.487 --> 37:55.795
Four of them went through.

37:55.795 --> 38:00.495
The green light is given.
The heist is on.

38:00.495 --> 38:03.629
Those four went through
to those bank accounts

38:03.629 --> 38:06.066
in the Philippines
that had been opened

38:06.066 --> 38:07.589
more than six months earlier.

38:07.589 --> 38:10.636
And they were able
to transfer out $81 million

38:10.636 --> 38:12.638
to the bank in the Philippines.

38:34.181 --> 38:37.837
Ultimately, they were about
to transfer $1 billion

38:37.837 --> 38:39.534
from the Bank of Bangladesh,

38:39.534 --> 38:42.494
but they didn't want
anyone to find out.

38:47.847 --> 38:51.459
They began to cover
their tracks.

38:51.459 --> 38:53.200
Normally, as a bank employee,

38:53.200 --> 38:55.071
you'll load up
the SWIFT software,

38:55.071 --> 38:57.944
you'll see on the screen
all the latest transactions,

38:57.944 --> 38:59.598
you can make transactions.

38:59.598 --> 39:04.342
And so the attackers deleted all
records of those transactions.

39:07.083 --> 39:08.563
But it's not just digital.

39:08.563 --> 39:13.002
In the world of finance,
everything must be a hard copy.

39:13.002 --> 39:16.005
And the attackers
knew that as well.

39:20.575 --> 39:23.622
Every SWIFT transaction
that takes place

39:23.622 --> 39:28.975
is immediately printed out
locally in the Bangladeshi Bank.

39:28.975 --> 39:31.978
So that printer cannot
be working

39:31.978 --> 39:34.676
when the heist is going on.

39:34.676 --> 39:37.549
The attackers hijacked
all of those print jobs,

39:37.549 --> 39:40.421
replaced all of those
print jobs with zeros

39:40.421 --> 39:43.555
so that nothing would
come out of the printer.

39:43.555 --> 39:48.516
Now, the other 30
wire transactions sat around.

39:48.516 --> 39:51.867
And, ultimately,
the attackers waited,

39:51.867 --> 39:54.261
and they waited...

39:54.261 --> 39:58.874
And they logged out at
3:59 a.m. Bangladesh time.

39:58.874 --> 40:01.442
Potentially, they thought
that in New York,

40:01.442 --> 40:03.096
the business day ended
at five p.m.,

40:03.096 --> 40:04.924
and they weren't gonna hear
any more.

40:04.924 --> 40:06.882
The New York Fed
had actually stopped

40:06.882 --> 40:08.449
the rest of the transactions,

40:08.449 --> 40:11.931
because the address for
the bank in the Philippines

40:11.931 --> 40:15.804
was on Jupiter Street.
J-U-P-I-T-E-R.

40:15.804 --> 40:20.853
Right, now this is when
the story gets really weird.

40:20.853 --> 40:24.857
In a totally unrelated incident
two years earlier,

40:24.857 --> 40:28.469
we have a Greek shipping
magnate, Dimitris Cambis,

40:28.469 --> 40:32.038
and he is buying eight tankers.

40:32.038 --> 40:35.258
What Dimitris knew,
but not many other people,

40:35.258 --> 40:39.872
was that the money
for these eight oil tankers

40:39.872 --> 40:41.917
came from Iran,

40:41.917 --> 40:45.660
and Iran was under US sanctions.

40:45.660 --> 40:48.358
Someone in the US
caught wind of the fact

40:48.358 --> 40:51.710
that the Iranians were
financing Mr Cambis.

40:51.710 --> 40:55.017
His company was put on
the sanctions watch list,

40:55.017 --> 40:58.325
and his company
was called Jupiter Seaways.

41:00.675 --> 41:02.590
It was just their bad luck

41:02.590 --> 41:05.201
that they designated
the money transfers

41:05.201 --> 41:11.338
to go to the Jupiter branch
of the Rizal Bank in Manila.

41:11.338 --> 41:15.211
As the transfers were being sent
out from the New York Reserve

41:15.211 --> 41:16.996
to the Philippines,

41:16.996 --> 41:20.956
the Jupiter name was caught
by the computer system.

41:20.956 --> 41:23.916
It halted these transactions.

41:23.916 --> 41:26.484
The Fed had to take
a second look.

41:26.484 --> 41:28.790
They stopped it
because they realised,

41:28.790 --> 41:31.184
"Wait, we have somewhere
in the order 35 transactions

41:31.184 --> 41:33.229
coming from
the Bank of Bangladesh,

41:33.229 --> 41:37.407
adding up to $1 billion?
You know, this isn't usual."

41:37.407 --> 41:40.062
So they held them
and sent a message back,

41:40.062 --> 41:41.890
asking for confirmation.

41:44.589 --> 41:47.766
Had the attackers waited
just one more hour,

41:47.766 --> 41:50.595
they could have replied to them
via the SWIFT system,

41:50.595 --> 41:53.206
saying these transactions
were not a mistake.

41:53.206 --> 41:55.295
Ultimately,
the Bank of Bangladesh

41:55.295 --> 41:57.253
might have lost
much, much more.

41:57.253 --> 42:01.344
So far, they managed
to get $81 million.

42:01.344 --> 42:05.435
But, boy, did they come close
to hitting the jackpot.

42:05.435 --> 42:07.655
Just under $1 billion

42:07.655 --> 42:11.572
was very, very nearly
stolen from this bank.

42:22.061 --> 42:25.194
The next day,
the bank employees came in,

42:25.194 --> 42:26.587
and the printer wasn't working,

42:26.587 --> 42:28.937
because they installed
their malicious code

42:28.937 --> 42:30.722
to prevent that from happening.

42:30.722 --> 42:32.637
Ultimately,
those bank employees

42:32.637 --> 42:34.900
didn't get it fixed
until February 6,

42:34.900 --> 42:36.554
which would have been a Sunday.

42:38.251 --> 42:41.297
When the printer started,
all these messages came out,

42:41.297 --> 42:42.908
messages from the Fed asking,

42:42.908 --> 42:46.041
"What are these 30 transactions?
Did you mean to make these?"

42:46.041 --> 42:48.304
That triggered
the Bank of Bangladesh

42:48.304 --> 42:51.003
to realise something
had gone wrong.

42:51.003 --> 42:53.658
It was very clear
that they were in deep,

42:53.658 --> 42:57.357
such that the bank manager...
This is the Bank of Bangladesh,

42:57.357 --> 43:00.534
the federal bank, the national
bank of the country,

43:00.534 --> 43:04.103
did not notify the leaders,

43:04.103 --> 43:07.236
the government of Bangladesh.
He kept it under wraps.

43:07.236 --> 43:10.544
He notified someone he knew
who knew about security.

43:10.544 --> 43:12.372
"Get on a plane,
get to Bangladesh.

43:12.372 --> 43:14.940
I need you to look at
these computer systems."

43:20.467 --> 43:22.948
Initially, the governor
and his whole team

43:22.948 --> 43:24.166
were quite perplexed.

43:24.166 --> 43:27.343
They didn't quite know
what had happened.

43:27.343 --> 43:30.216
So they thought that
some money had been routed

43:30.216 --> 43:33.045
to a wrong account;
it would come back.

43:36.309 --> 43:39.921
I get this strange phone call
from the governor's office

43:39.921 --> 43:42.707
asking me if I would
drop everything

43:42.707 --> 43:45.274
and come to Dhaka, Bangladesh.

43:49.061 --> 43:51.237
So I assembled a team...

43:52.107 --> 43:53.892
and we flew down.

43:57.896 --> 44:02.596
When we arrived there, we met
with the Bangladesh Bank team.

44:02.596 --> 44:06.121
And that's when I discovered
all the horrifying details

44:06.121 --> 44:08.471
of what had actually happened.

44:12.388 --> 44:15.217
They decide,
"Let's look at the CCTV.

44:15.217 --> 44:17.393
What's that going to tell us?"

44:17.393 --> 44:20.309
There were eight
hours' worth of tapes

44:20.309 --> 44:23.138
that had to be gone through.

44:23.138 --> 44:26.054
Your gut instinct is,
you have a malicious insider.

44:26.054 --> 44:27.708
A physical person had to go in,

44:27.708 --> 44:30.842
log into that machine
and try to make these transfers,

44:30.842 --> 44:34.715
because this attack
hadn't happened before.

44:34.715 --> 44:37.631
They had a SWIFT room,
which was locked.

44:37.631 --> 44:39.938
And typically when
the SWIFT operators

44:39.938 --> 44:43.724
needed to do something on SWIFT,
they had to go into the room,

44:43.724 --> 44:47.467
sit in that chair and terminal,

44:47.467 --> 44:52.037
and there was only
one shadow we could find.

44:52.037 --> 44:54.779
We eventually decided
it was the person

44:54.779 --> 44:58.391
sweeping the place after hours.

45:00.741 --> 45:04.310
They were saying, "How could
somebody process the transaction

45:04.310 --> 45:05.964
when there was nobody there?"

45:05.964 --> 45:10.577
I mean, even after the payment
instructions had been sent,

45:10.577 --> 45:15.408
they had no idea for a very long
time what was happening.

45:15.408 --> 45:19.412
They didn't think it was a hack.
They had no traces of a hack.

45:19.412 --> 45:22.632
But they watched eight hours of
that footage over that weekend

45:22.632 --> 45:25.635
and realised there was
no one at that computer.

45:25.635 --> 45:26.941
Nothing.

45:26.941 --> 45:29.248
They had no idea that
the Bank of Bangladesh

45:29.248 --> 45:31.859
had been breached by hackers.

45:31.859 --> 45:35.384
Only after we see these things
happen over and over again,

45:35.384 --> 45:39.171
we realise that cyber
has such capabilities.

45:44.045 --> 45:47.440
Bangladesh was a bit of
a bombshell for all of us.

45:49.311 --> 45:52.097
Hackers and most cybercrime,

45:52.097 --> 45:54.055
it's like smash-and-grab crime.

45:54.055 --> 45:56.492
Quickly grab something
and monetise it

45:56.492 --> 45:58.103
as swiftly as you can.

45:58.103 --> 46:01.236
You know, storm a bank
with shotguns, blow a safe,

46:01.236 --> 46:03.978
fill some bags with cash.

46:03.978 --> 46:06.024
Cybercrime...

46:06.024 --> 46:09.418
It doesn't lend itself well
to long conspiracy

46:09.418 --> 46:11.856
and lots of investigation
and investment

46:11.856 --> 46:13.596
into understanding your target.

46:13.596 --> 46:15.903
I mean, you couldn't
do Bangladesh

46:15.903 --> 46:19.037
unless you really understood
the internal workings

46:19.037 --> 46:21.909
of the central bank
and all the actors involved.

46:21.909 --> 46:24.607
That's not something
that freelance hackers

46:24.607 --> 46:26.827
really are good at.

46:26.827 --> 46:29.917
That requires a level of
investment into resources

46:29.917 --> 46:34.095
and frankly intelligence
that has to be sustained.

46:34.095 --> 46:38.012
To organise something
of that complexity

46:38.012 --> 46:40.841
and for it not to be noticed

46:40.841 --> 46:43.539
by the intelligence agencies
of the state

46:43.539 --> 46:46.020
where that is being planned

46:46.020 --> 46:50.285
would be very,
very difficult indeed.

46:50.285 --> 46:53.419
These hackers went in
and looked at the zeros and ones

46:53.419 --> 46:55.725
in the software
and reverse engineered it,

46:55.725 --> 46:58.380
turned it back into
understandable code.

46:58.380 --> 47:00.905
That's not something
that happens overnight.

47:00.905 --> 47:02.384
It was pretty clear

47:02.384 --> 47:04.865
that this isn't just
normal criminals.

47:04.865 --> 47:07.128
This has to be something bigger.

47:10.044 --> 47:13.961
Once attackers have gained
access to their target network,

47:13.961 --> 47:16.007
they want to stay undetected.

47:18.487 --> 47:20.968
And we've seen many
interesting examples

47:20.968 --> 47:23.014
of how exactly this is done.

47:26.278 --> 47:27.801
What exactly happened

47:27.801 --> 47:30.195
at the Natanz nuclear facility
last week?

47:30.195 --> 47:32.806
It's a question people in Iran
around the world

47:32.806 --> 47:35.461
have been asking
since a fire was reported

47:35.461 --> 47:38.856
at Iran's main uranium
enrichment facility on Thursday.

47:38.856 --> 47:41.902
We're used to Trojans
and viruses on the internet,

47:41.902 --> 47:43.338
but this is the first worm

47:43.338 --> 47:46.907
designed to damage
the physical world.

47:46.907 --> 47:51.042
In 2010, attackers created
a piece of malicious software

47:51.042 --> 47:55.350
that was designed to infiltrate
Iran's nuclear programme,

47:55.350 --> 47:57.004
to get into their centrifuges,

47:57.004 --> 47:59.050
in particular,
get onto computers

47:59.050 --> 48:00.921
that controlled
their centrifuges.

48:00.921 --> 48:04.142
Iran says it will
retaliate against any country

48:04.142 --> 48:06.884
that conducts cyber-attacks
on its nuclear sites.

48:06.884 --> 48:09.538
The intention
was to spin the centrifuges

48:09.538 --> 48:12.150
of Iran's nuclear capabilities
out of control,

48:12.150 --> 48:14.152
make the centrifuges explode

48:14.152 --> 48:15.414
and push them ten years back

48:15.414 --> 48:17.372
in the uranium enrichment programme.

48:17.372 --> 48:18.721
As a piece of malware,

48:18.721 --> 48:21.768
it was 40 times larger
than any piece of malware

48:21.768 --> 48:24.336
that had ever been
encountered before.

48:24.336 --> 48:28.514
It would have taken
the most advanced,

48:28.514 --> 48:30.995
brilliant computer engineers

48:30.995 --> 48:34.085
years and years of human
working hours

48:34.085 --> 48:35.956
to produce this.

48:35.956 --> 48:38.089
Why was it so big?

48:38.089 --> 48:42.310
Because it needed
to cover itself up.

48:44.834 --> 48:47.794
The attackers
were actually recording

48:47.794 --> 48:52.320
the network traffic,
the normal network traffic,

48:52.320 --> 48:55.062
and then playing it back
to the sensors

48:55.062 --> 48:58.848
when they started modifying the
operations of the centrifuges

48:58.848 --> 49:00.720
they were trying to break.

49:04.463 --> 49:06.900
This is the equivalent of,
in the real world,

49:06.900 --> 49:09.903
recording the CCTV footage
from a security camera

49:09.903 --> 49:12.166
and then playing it back
to the camera

49:12.166 --> 49:14.125
when you're doing
something bad.

49:14.125 --> 49:16.301
That's what Stuxnet was doing.

49:16.301 --> 49:18.042
And in the Bangladesh heist,

49:18.042 --> 49:20.218
they were doing
something similar.

49:20.218 --> 49:22.872
Once they made
their transactions,

49:22.872 --> 49:26.311
they wanted to make sure no one
realised they had happened.

49:26.311 --> 49:29.053
They were actually falsifying
the information

49:29.053 --> 49:30.576
about transactions.

49:30.576 --> 49:33.405
The recording of the
transactions were being done

49:33.405 --> 49:34.972
both in electronic format,

49:34.972 --> 49:38.540
but also falsifying the data
being sent to the printers,

49:38.540 --> 49:41.021
which actually looked like
everything was fine.

49:41.021 --> 49:44.242
So you find out how
you're being tracked,

49:44.242 --> 49:46.984
and then you try
to cover your tracks.

49:46.984 --> 49:48.246
Stuxnet did that.

49:48.246 --> 49:50.770
The Bangladeshi heist
did it as well.

49:53.207 --> 49:56.950
Once that money
arrived in the Philippines,

49:56.950 --> 50:00.519
they needed to change
that money into cold, hard cash.

50:00.519 --> 50:02.912
Right now, it's still in
digital ones and zeros,

50:02.912 --> 50:05.437
just a transaction that said
the money has moved

50:05.437 --> 50:06.829
from the Bank of Bangladesh

50:06.829 --> 50:10.094
to these accounts at RCBC.
Four accounts.

50:10.094 --> 50:13.532
The thieves had to
get it out of the Philippines,

50:13.532 --> 50:15.621
make it disappear.

50:15.621 --> 50:18.450
So how were they going
to do that?

50:18.450 --> 50:20.843
There is one industry
in the Philippines

50:20.843 --> 50:23.237
where there is absolutely
no oversight,

50:23.237 --> 50:27.241
where it's a cash-only business.
There are no records, no names.

50:27.241 --> 50:29.113
That is the casino industry.

50:41.125 --> 50:43.257
When we talk about
laundering funds,

50:43.257 --> 50:45.955
we're talking about
taking dirty, illicit funds,

50:45.955 --> 50:49.481
running them through
a legal business

50:49.481 --> 50:52.049
so that if I came
to you and said,

50:52.049 --> 50:55.400
"Hey, where'd you get
that $81 million?",

50:55.400 --> 51:00.318
you could have a paper trail
to show that you won it back.

51:00.318 --> 51:03.103
The hard part
is not stealing the money.

51:03.103 --> 51:06.628
The hard part is moving the
money into a form you can use

51:06.628 --> 51:08.152
without getting caught.

51:10.241 --> 51:15.202
And one method we've seen
for quite a while is gambling.

51:15.202 --> 51:17.074
It was very clear that,

51:17.074 --> 51:20.251
if, at all, there was a place
for you to do that,

51:20.251 --> 51:22.166
it would have been
the Philippines,

51:22.166 --> 51:25.038
because the casinos
are not regulated at all.

51:27.171 --> 51:30.304
It's like a lot of
high-flying gamblers

51:30.304 --> 51:33.307
who'd kind of fly to Manila,

51:33.307 --> 51:37.050
crowd these numerous casinos
in Manila,

51:37.050 --> 51:38.399
lots of money coming in.

51:38.399 --> 51:41.315
People don't question
that kind of money.

51:41.315 --> 51:42.795
I mean, you know...

51:42.795 --> 51:44.753
"Well, as long as
it's coming to us,

51:44.753 --> 51:47.887
we don't bother too much
about where it is coming from."

51:49.323 --> 51:52.283
The thieves knew
if they could get that money

51:52.283 --> 51:55.547
into the casinos,
it would essentially be lost.

51:56.809 --> 51:58.115
What happened was,

51:58.115 --> 52:00.421
the manager from
the Philippines bank,

52:00.421 --> 52:03.381
she was the one who'd opened
those four accounts

52:03.381 --> 52:05.557
using fraudulent IDs.

52:05.557 --> 52:09.952
She got the money withdrawn from
the bank in the Philippines.

52:11.563 --> 52:12.955
From there, it started to go

52:12.955 --> 52:14.566
through something
called Philrem.

52:14.566 --> 52:18.004
It's a bit like a Western Union
in the Philippines,

52:18.004 --> 52:20.180
transferred into pesos.

52:20.180 --> 52:22.487
I don't know
if you've ever used

52:22.487 --> 52:24.010
Philippine pesos before,

52:24.010 --> 52:28.057
but that's one hell
of a lot of pesos, $22 million.

52:28.057 --> 52:33.454
In fact,
it's over one million banknotes.

52:33.454 --> 52:35.630
They actually had
to request that cash

52:35.630 --> 52:38.981
to come from a sister
branch location,

52:38.981 --> 52:40.853
that arrived in boxes.

52:40.853 --> 52:44.422
The bank manager was seen by
one of the other bank employees

52:44.422 --> 52:47.599
collecting those boxes
and literally going outside

52:47.599 --> 52:49.862
and loading them up
into a Lexus.

52:50.993 --> 52:53.344
And that money
was driven away.

52:59.785 --> 53:03.702
So, we're talking stacks
of bills carried in vans

53:03.702 --> 53:07.227
to the Solaire Casino
right by the airport.

53:07.227 --> 53:10.448
It allows the Chinese gamblers
to come off the plane.

53:10.448 --> 53:13.320
Five minutes, they're on
the floor playing baccarat.

53:16.410 --> 53:19.979
The money goes to this place.
It's wheeled in wheelbarrows

53:19.979 --> 53:24.113
across the casino floor
up to this guarded escalator.

53:35.255 --> 53:38.215
There's so much
physical cash involved,

53:38.215 --> 53:41.305
they've enlisted their
own crew of gamblers

53:41.305 --> 53:44.830
to launder the stolen funds.

53:44.830 --> 53:47.093
And they just played baccarat,

53:47.093 --> 53:49.617
all day long.

53:49.617 --> 53:51.140
They had individuals,

53:51.140 --> 53:54.231
mostly appeared to be Chinese
nationals that they had,

53:54.231 --> 53:57.538
I assume, hired to take
those funds and launder them.

53:57.538 --> 54:01.499
You change that cash
into casino chips,

54:01.499 --> 54:03.152
play a few games,

54:03.152 --> 54:04.937
cash in the chips.

54:04.937 --> 54:10.595
And when you get that cash back,
that is then laundered.

54:10.595 --> 54:13.119
And this wouldn't
have been unusual.

54:13.119 --> 54:15.513
This was the Chinese lunar week.

54:15.513 --> 54:18.298
That would've been very common
for individuals,

54:18.298 --> 54:20.561
high rollers, to come
into the Philippines

54:20.561 --> 54:22.868
and play at the casinos
during that time.

54:22.868 --> 54:26.611
Spending $22 million in
a casino over a weekend,

54:26.611 --> 54:28.569
let's face it, could be fun.

54:32.878 --> 54:36.708
Doing this story
and trying to figure out

54:36.708 --> 54:40.407
where in history
to sort of place this thing.

54:40.407 --> 54:43.323
Was this the biggest
heist of all time?

54:43.323 --> 54:47.327
No, but it certainly looked
to be the biggest cyber heist

54:47.327 --> 54:50.243
of a bank in history.

54:50.243 --> 54:54.378
And over the next few days,
I just remember

54:54.378 --> 54:58.425
calling up my sources
at Symantec

54:58.425 --> 55:00.993
and a couple other
cybersecurity firms

55:00.993 --> 55:04.257
and getting in touch with
a guy named Eric Chien.

55:06.085 --> 55:09.131
We have all kinds of
sensors sitting on networks

55:09.131 --> 55:10.785
and computers
all over the world.

55:10.785 --> 55:14.136
Any time some sort of
cyber criminal, some attacker,

55:14.136 --> 55:18.053
is trying to breach a computer,
they're leaving traces behind.

55:19.577 --> 55:23.537
Every attack
has a signature.

55:23.537 --> 55:25.104
If you look at it long enough,

55:25.104 --> 55:27.454
if you study it,
if you work it long enough,

55:27.454 --> 55:29.717
you can understand
the way they do things.

55:29.717 --> 55:31.284
The way they state something,

55:31.284 --> 55:34.461
the way they code
a particular way,

55:34.461 --> 55:39.901
the methodology of the attack,
the step-by-step approaches.

55:39.901 --> 55:42.904
It might be considered
like Sherlock Holmesian

55:42.904 --> 55:44.384
to come up with this idea.

55:44.384 --> 55:46.778
"Because he walks
with a gait this way,

55:46.778 --> 55:48.954
and he does this..."
But it is true.

55:48.954 --> 55:53.262
We see those signatures.
We see those patterns.

55:54.220 --> 55:56.004
What we discovered was,

55:56.004 --> 55:59.443
by looking at the artefacts
that these attackers had used,

55:59.443 --> 56:01.880
the malicious binaries
they had used,

56:01.880 --> 56:03.185
the code inside of it,

56:03.185 --> 56:05.753
as well as the email accounts
that they used

56:05.753 --> 56:07.929
to send the initial
spear-phishing messages,

56:07.929 --> 56:12.499
we were able to map this back
to an attacker back in 2014.

56:15.415 --> 56:18.505
Sony Pictures is mainly housed
in Culver City.

56:18.505 --> 56:20.507
And in 2014,

56:20.507 --> 56:24.598
Sony Pictures went down,
which was unheard of.

56:24.598 --> 56:26.078
On that day in November,

56:26.078 --> 56:28.559
people would have come in,
tried to swipe their badge

56:28.559 --> 56:30.778
and not even be able
to get into the office.

56:30.778 --> 56:32.780
They get
into the building finally

56:32.780 --> 56:35.957
and then they discover that
nothing else is working either.

56:35.957 --> 56:40.005
Printers aren't working,
computers aren't working.

56:40.005 --> 56:43.225
People who had laptops
connected to the network

56:43.225 --> 56:44.966
would have immediately seen

56:44.966 --> 56:47.926
skulls and crossbones
show up on their screens,

56:47.926 --> 56:51.016
scrolling with scary
<i>Halloween</i>-type music

56:51.016 --> 56:52.496
playing in the background.

56:52.496 --> 56:55.716
And it said,
"Hacked by the GOP."

56:55.716 --> 56:58.980
Guardians of the Peace.

56:58.980 --> 57:02.027
A mysterious crew of hackers,

57:02.027 --> 57:05.987
also known as the Lazarus Group.

57:05.987 --> 57:08.120
We'd call them
the Lazarus Group.

57:08.120 --> 57:09.251
They've been responsible

57:09.251 --> 57:11.123
for many, many attacks
over the years.

57:11.123 --> 57:13.342
You know, political statements

57:13.342 --> 57:15.954
and bringing down some
websites in South Korea

57:15.954 --> 57:20.306
and also the White House in the
United States and the Pentagon.

57:20.306 --> 57:23.875
Now, at this point,
the penny has dropped.

57:23.875 --> 57:26.007
Sony has been hacked.

57:26.007 --> 57:28.662
The hack attack
has had a devastating effect

57:28.662 --> 57:31.491
on the entertainment company,
with an avalanche of leaks

57:31.491 --> 57:34.189
revealing personal information
of employees

57:34.189 --> 57:37.497
and salacious email exchanges
of A-list celebrities.

57:37.497 --> 57:40.500
They ultimately compromised
Sony Pictures Network,

57:40.500 --> 57:43.851
got inside
and wiped 10,000 computers.

57:43.851 --> 57:45.592
On top of that,
they actually stole

57:45.592 --> 57:48.682
all kinds of documents
and emails from Sony Pictures.

57:48.682 --> 57:50.815
The hack
on Sony Pictures

57:50.815 --> 57:53.382
is rocking Hollywood's
very foundation;

57:53.382 --> 57:56.037
the industry,
warts and all, exposed.

57:56.037 --> 57:59.258
Initially, we had no link
between the SWIFT attack

57:59.258 --> 58:01.956
and the Sony Pictures attack.

58:01.956 --> 58:04.481
But when we were looking
at the malware,

58:04.481 --> 58:06.395
we found an interesting detail.

58:06.395 --> 58:09.573
There was a component
called an indexing manager,

58:09.573 --> 58:13.011
which was saving the logs
during the SWIFT attack

58:13.011 --> 58:15.492
into an encrypted file.

58:15.492 --> 58:18.538
The file was encrypted
with a really long key,

58:18.538 --> 58:22.063
and when we just
googled for the key,

58:22.063 --> 58:25.284
we found that the same key, exactly,

58:25.284 --> 58:30.594
was used 18 months earlier
in the Sony Pictures attack.

58:31.769 --> 58:34.119
This was
the moment we realised

58:34.119 --> 58:36.077
the Bangladeshi SWIFT attack

58:36.077 --> 58:39.733
was probably perpetrated
by the Lazarus Group.

58:40.691 --> 58:42.301
So, who is Lazarus?

58:42.301 --> 58:43.781
Well, from what we know,

58:43.781 --> 58:46.740
they're a trans-global
criminal organisation

58:46.740 --> 58:51.571
that's been trained
at a nation-state level.

58:51.571 --> 58:55.444
The nation states really started
coming in on a criminal side...

58:57.055 --> 58:59.231
when sanctions started.

58:59.231 --> 59:02.277
When we start limiting
the capability of a nation

59:02.277 --> 59:05.411
to get cash, and we up
the methodology

59:05.411 --> 59:07.979
to monitor
the way they're getting cash,

59:07.979 --> 59:11.025
they turn to different approaches.

59:11.025 --> 59:13.898
So if you're a country
that's under sanction

59:13.898 --> 59:17.162
and your ability to get funds
has been compromised,

59:17.162 --> 59:20.121
you may be motivated to
go to the Lazarus Group

59:20.121 --> 59:23.429
to fix your problem.

59:23.429 --> 59:25.649
It's like a job for them.
It <i>is</i> a job for them.

59:25.649 --> 59:27.694
They get recruited.
It's a nine-to-five job.

59:27.694 --> 59:30.958
They come in, and each
of them has their specialties.

59:30.958 --> 59:32.351
They have managers,

59:32.351 --> 59:35.223
they have targets that
they're told to go after.

59:35.223 --> 59:37.356
When you talk about
nation states,

59:37.356 --> 59:39.619
obviously,
for your average nation state,

59:39.619 --> 59:42.927
most cyber offensive campaigns
are under the military.

59:42.927 --> 59:45.712
It's very similar to how
a military organisation

59:45.712 --> 59:49.020
would be organised for their
cyber offensive campaigns.

59:49.020 --> 59:51.457
There is a hotel,
for example, in China

59:51.457 --> 59:53.590
where they've taken over
multiple floors

59:53.590 --> 59:55.635
where they essentially
have dormitories.

59:55.635 --> 59:59.073
They go to sleep in that hotel,
they eat in that hotel,

59:59.073 --> 01:00:01.423
and they don't come
out of that hotel.

01:00:01.423 --> 01:00:04.078
They just move from
one room to another,

01:00:04.078 --> 01:00:05.863
hack all day and night.

01:00:08.039 --> 01:00:10.650
And the Lazarus Group
is thought to be made up

01:00:10.650 --> 01:00:13.392
of these state-trained hackers.

01:00:18.745 --> 01:00:21.226
What's amazing about cyber,

01:00:21.226 --> 01:00:23.794
when you talk about
nation states,

01:00:23.794 --> 01:00:27.319
is the cost to entry
is extremely low.

01:00:27.319 --> 01:00:29.713
We have nation states
who have been

01:00:29.713 --> 01:00:33.194
trying to create
nuclear missiles,

01:00:33.194 --> 01:00:35.066
tried to create
a nuclear programme.

01:00:35.066 --> 01:00:36.981
Places like Iran, for example.

01:00:36.981 --> 01:00:41.507
The dollars it costs to do so,
it's extraordinary.

01:00:41.507 --> 01:00:44.684
But if you want to build
a cyber offensive campaign,

01:00:44.684 --> 01:00:46.991
you get two, three,
four, five guys

01:00:46.991 --> 01:00:50.472
and potentially threaten
to disable the power grid

01:00:50.472 --> 01:00:52.039
in some country.

01:00:52.039 --> 01:00:54.476
When you talk about
trying to rob a bank

01:00:54.476 --> 01:00:57.175
or produce illicit drugs
and sell them,

01:00:57.175 --> 01:00:59.830
the amount of people
required on the ground,

01:00:59.830 --> 01:01:01.266
the amount of connections,

01:01:01.266 --> 01:01:03.442
and for the dollars
that you would receive,

01:01:03.442 --> 01:01:04.922
is nothing compared to,

01:01:04.922 --> 01:01:07.446
"Let's get three guys,
break into a bank

01:01:07.446 --> 01:01:10.667
and potentially
transfer $1 billion."

01:01:16.063 --> 01:01:20.502
Back in the VIP room
of the Solaire Casino in Manila,

01:01:20.502 --> 01:01:24.942
the money-laundering operation
is in full flight.

01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:29.729
They just spend hours
upon hours gambling away,

01:01:29.729 --> 01:01:31.296
collecting chips.

01:01:31.296 --> 01:01:33.733
They transfer those chips
back into cold, hard currency.

01:01:33.733 --> 01:01:36.693
You put a hundred
gamblers into the VIP lounge

01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:40.784
playing cash, so maybe the house
has a one or two percent margin.

01:01:40.784 --> 01:01:43.743
But all the rest is untraceable
money that they walk out with.

01:01:43.743 --> 01:01:46.006
What's interesting
about these individuals,

01:01:46.006 --> 01:01:47.704
they weren't interested
in winning.

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:50.184
They were just interested
in playing.

01:01:50.184 --> 01:01:51.620
If you lose the money,

01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:53.405
the money doesn't go
to the casino,

01:01:53.405 --> 01:01:54.928
it goes to the other players.

01:01:54.928 --> 01:01:58.410
So you can play the table
where the other players are,

01:01:58.410 --> 01:01:59.846
your partners.

01:01:59.846 --> 01:02:02.196
Then you can lose
the dirty money on purpose,

01:02:02.196 --> 01:02:04.024
moving the money
to your partners.

01:02:04.024 --> 01:02:05.678
Now it's cashed out.

01:02:05.678 --> 01:02:09.073
Now it looks like it came from a
great win in a poker tournament

01:02:09.073 --> 01:02:11.640
instead of being stolen
from somewhere.

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:14.513
So, casinos are a good way
of laundering money.

01:02:14.513 --> 01:02:17.342
Real-world criminals have
done that for decades.

01:02:17.342 --> 01:02:20.606
Online criminals
are doing it today.

01:02:20.606 --> 01:02:23.740
They played for a whole week,
that whole lunar week,

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.698
every day, like workers,

01:02:25.698 --> 01:02:28.309
nine to five, essentially,
in that casino.

01:02:33.358 --> 01:02:36.361
Finally, the Chinese
New Year celebrations

01:02:36.361 --> 01:02:37.884
have come to an end.

01:02:37.884 --> 01:02:42.280
The staff at the RCBC bank
in Manila are back at work.

01:02:44.369 --> 01:02:47.328
Now, the Bangladesh Bank
is still desperately trying

01:02:47.328 --> 01:02:49.417
to put a stop
on any further withdrawals

01:02:49.417 --> 01:02:52.159
from those accounts
in the Bank of the Philippines.

01:02:52.159 --> 01:02:54.509
They've lost
$22 million already,

01:02:54.509 --> 01:02:58.818
but there's still $59 million
left that they can save.

01:02:58.818 --> 01:03:01.865
They're firing message
after message to Manila,

01:03:01.865 --> 01:03:04.737
"Hold all transactions."

01:03:04.737 --> 01:03:07.087
In the Philippines,
they got those messages.

01:03:07.087 --> 01:03:08.567
They got those messages

01:03:08.567 --> 01:03:10.830
as part of many other
transaction messages they got

01:03:10.830 --> 01:03:12.701
that were sitting in
a printer queue

01:03:12.701 --> 01:03:14.051
at the bottom of the stack,

01:03:14.051 --> 01:03:16.357
and ultimately, they never
saw those messages.

01:03:16.357 --> 01:03:20.797
At this point, the fence
gets in touch with the manager

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:22.799
of the bank in Jupiter Street.

01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:26.672
"Can you please authorise
the transfer of $59 million?"

01:03:26.672 --> 01:03:29.849
She authorises that $59 million.

01:03:29.849 --> 01:03:34.114
It goes straight
to the Solaire Casino.

01:03:34.114 --> 01:03:36.029
More money laundering.

01:03:37.901 --> 01:03:39.424
Five hours later,

01:03:39.424 --> 01:03:44.037
after increasingly urgent calls
from the Bangladesh Bank,

01:03:44.037 --> 01:03:50.000
the manager finally puts a block
on all of the accounts.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.829
But, really, it's too late.

01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:54.831
The money's gone.

01:03:59.139 --> 01:04:02.273
It's incredible when you think
what the Lazarus Group

01:04:02.273 --> 01:04:05.885
was able to pull off with
just some ones and zeros.

01:04:05.885 --> 01:04:07.756
They guide their bespoke malware

01:04:07.756 --> 01:04:10.020
into the computer network
of a bank,

01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:11.717
and then a year later,

01:04:11.717 --> 01:04:15.025
they're literally washing
$100 million

01:04:15.025 --> 01:04:17.331
through a casino
in the Philippines.

01:04:17.331 --> 01:04:19.856
It's astonishing.

01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:22.336
But what's really, really scary

01:04:22.336 --> 01:04:25.687
is what happened
just a year later.

01:04:27.428 --> 01:04:29.561
Now back to
the major cyber-attack,

01:04:29.561 --> 01:04:34.087
the ransomware crippling 200,000
computers in 150 countries.

01:04:34.087 --> 01:04:37.699
The thousands of targets all
received this ominous message

01:04:37.699 --> 01:04:39.745
in English on their screens:

01:04:49.276 --> 01:04:54.151
Everyone was basically locked up
with this malware

01:04:54.151 --> 01:04:58.329
that we discovered had been
launched by the same attackers

01:04:58.329 --> 01:05:01.158
as the Central Bank
of Bangladesh.

01:05:01.158 --> 01:05:03.377
So they design this malware,

01:05:03.377 --> 01:05:05.989
and then they lose
control of it entirely.

01:05:05.989 --> 01:05:08.121
And that caused chaos.

01:05:08.121 --> 01:05:11.385
Ambulances were
diverted to other hospitals.

01:05:11.385 --> 01:05:14.823
Patients were turned away,
their operations cancelled.

01:05:14.823 --> 01:05:17.696
You know,
the first sign that something

01:05:17.696 --> 01:05:21.961
was seriously wrong was when
hospitals in the United Kingdom

01:05:21.961 --> 01:05:24.529
started telling patients,
"Don't come."

01:05:24.529 --> 01:05:28.533
That their systems had been
locked up with ransomware.

01:05:28.533 --> 01:05:33.625
It's unclear if it was
accidentally released too early,

01:05:33.625 --> 01:05:35.018
it appears so,

01:05:35.018 --> 01:05:37.890
or if it was
designed not to work

01:05:37.890 --> 01:05:41.241
and just begin wiping computers,
because it didn't matter.

01:05:41.241 --> 01:05:44.157
Even if you paid them, you would
not get the decryption key.

01:05:44.157 --> 01:05:45.985
They didn't have
the decryption key.

01:05:45.985 --> 01:05:48.118
They couldn't decrypt your files anymore.

01:05:48.118 --> 01:05:50.816
Japan, Turkey
and the Philippines

01:05:50.816 --> 01:05:54.733
were also affected.
In the US, FedEx was hit.

01:05:54.733 --> 01:05:59.694
That virulent virus
spiralled out of control.

01:05:59.694 --> 01:06:04.047
In Germany, it attacked the
network of the Deutsche Bahn,

01:06:04.047 --> 01:06:05.439
German Railway.

01:06:05.439 --> 01:06:09.400
In Spain,
WannaCry hit Telefonica,

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:12.359
the biggest telecommunications company.

01:06:12.359 --> 01:06:16.537
It hit the banking systems,
and ATMs didn't work.

01:06:16.537 --> 01:06:21.847
This thing was hitting companies
in something like 150 countries.

01:06:21.847 --> 01:06:23.588
Other targets in the US

01:06:23.588 --> 01:06:26.025
include Merck Pharmaceutical
in New Jersey.

01:06:26.025 --> 01:06:28.810
Even the company that makes
Oreo cookies may have been hit.

01:06:28.810 --> 01:06:32.945
So, you had the health
service, you had transport,

01:06:32.945 --> 01:06:36.470
you had communications,
you had the finance system,

01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:37.906
and you had governance

01:06:37.906 --> 01:06:42.824
all with one tiny piece
of crappy malware, WannaCry.

01:06:42.824 --> 01:06:44.130
In other attacks,

01:06:44.130 --> 01:06:46.002
they have to send you
a spear-phishing email,

01:06:46.002 --> 01:06:48.047
trick you into double-clicking
on an attachment.

01:06:48.047 --> 01:06:50.180
In this case, your computer
just had to be on,

01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:51.485
connected to the internet,

01:06:51.485 --> 01:06:54.053
and it would have got infected
by WannaCry.

01:06:54.053 --> 01:06:57.274
It succeeded because
the crappy malware

01:06:57.274 --> 01:07:00.407
was being infiltrated
into the systems

01:07:00.407 --> 01:07:03.193
on the back
of a much more powerful tool

01:07:03.193 --> 01:07:04.803
called EternalBlue,

01:07:04.803 --> 01:07:08.459
which had been developed by
the National Security Agency

01:07:08.459 --> 01:07:10.417
in the United States.

01:07:10.417 --> 01:07:12.637
The thing the NSA
never wanted to talk about

01:07:12.637 --> 01:07:15.640
was the fact that it was
travelling on a digital missile

01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:19.426
that had been built
at its own intelligence agency.

01:07:19.426 --> 01:07:22.560
They repurposed something
created by the US government,

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:24.170
leaked
by the Russian government,

01:07:24.170 --> 01:07:26.825
put it into their ransomware
that allowed it to spread

01:07:26.825 --> 01:07:30.742
all over the world,
any computer on at that time.

01:07:30.742 --> 01:07:34.006
So one crappy piece
of malware

01:07:34.006 --> 01:07:36.878
can hit every single aspect

01:07:36.878 --> 01:07:39.142
of the critical national infrastructure

01:07:39.142 --> 01:07:42.971
within the space
of about ten days

01:07:42.971 --> 01:07:44.886
in different countries.

01:07:57.508 --> 01:08:00.728
Eventually, there's a court case
after about a month.

01:08:00.728 --> 01:08:03.601
There's a court case in Manila.

01:08:03.601 --> 01:08:06.908
Ultimately, the bank manager
didn't want anyone to find out.

01:08:06.908 --> 01:08:08.388
But when he finally got in touch

01:08:08.388 --> 01:08:10.825
with the Bank
of the Philippines, they said,

01:08:10.825 --> 01:08:12.827
"If you need this money returned,

01:08:12.827 --> 01:08:15.700
you need to get a court order."
So he files a court order,

01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:18.006
but court orders are public
in the Philippines,

01:08:18.006 --> 01:08:19.573
like in many other countries.

01:08:19.573 --> 01:08:22.576
A reporter spots it and realised
that this has happened,

01:08:22.576 --> 01:08:25.101
publishes it in a newspaper,
and it all comes out.

01:08:25.101 --> 01:08:28.016
The $81 million
money-laundering scandal

01:08:28.016 --> 01:08:31.672
is now considered one of
the biggest bank heists in Asia.

01:08:31.672 --> 01:08:33.805
But how exactly
did thieves steal

01:08:33.805 --> 01:08:35.981
such a huge amount of money?

01:08:35.981 --> 01:08:37.461
Not just known
in the Philippines

01:08:37.461 --> 01:08:38.679
and the Bank of Bangladesh,

01:08:38.679 --> 01:08:40.377
when the Bangladesh
government finds out

01:08:40.377 --> 01:08:42.901
the bank manager has been
doing this behind the scenes,

01:08:42.901 --> 01:08:44.337
but the whole world finds out.

01:08:44.337 --> 01:08:46.774
And ultimately,
the Bangladesh Bank

01:08:46.774 --> 01:08:48.863
needs to get assistance
from the FBI.

01:08:48.863 --> 01:08:52.171
The New York Fed is involved.
The United States is involved.

01:08:52.171 --> 01:08:54.304
This becomes
a whole worldwide issue

01:08:54.304 --> 01:08:57.220
and begins to ripple across
the financial industry

01:08:57.220 --> 01:08:58.743
that this was even possible.

01:08:58.743 --> 01:09:00.527
Experts believe that hackers

01:09:00.527 --> 01:09:04.183
were able to break into the
New York Federal Reserve's

01:09:04.183 --> 01:09:06.403
special account for Bangladesh,

01:09:06.403 --> 01:09:09.754
getting away with $81 million.

01:09:09.754 --> 01:09:13.236
Now, Bangladesh's Central Bank
governor, Atiur Rahman,

01:09:13.236 --> 01:09:16.935
has resigned after hackers stole
tens of millions of dollars

01:09:16.935 --> 01:09:19.198
from the nation's
foreign reserves.

01:09:19.198 --> 01:09:23.159
The bank was criticised for
its handling of the breach...

01:09:23.159 --> 01:09:26.162
The governor was
an excellent central banker.

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:27.902
I have a lot of respect for him.

01:09:27.902 --> 01:09:32.298
He was deemed one of the top
bankers by the Asia <i>MoneyWeek.</i>

01:09:32.298 --> 01:09:34.126
And poor fellow, that time,

01:09:34.126 --> 01:09:36.737
he was faced with
this sort of scenario

01:09:36.737 --> 01:09:39.827
which he honestly
didn't understand.

01:09:39.827 --> 01:09:42.787
He had really pushed
the financial system

01:09:42.787 --> 01:09:45.529
in Bangladesh into
the 21st century.

01:09:45.529 --> 01:09:48.575
He had to essentially fall
on his sword and resign

01:09:48.575 --> 01:09:51.404
in disgrace,
and his career was ruined.

01:09:51.404 --> 01:09:54.190
Many others at the bank
had to resign as well.

01:09:54.190 --> 01:09:57.758
An emotional Maia Deguito,
the manager of the RCBC branch

01:09:57.758 --> 01:10:01.153
in Jupiter Street in Makati,
insists she is innocent

01:10:01.153 --> 01:10:02.763
in the face of accusations

01:10:02.763 --> 01:10:05.636
she is involved in the
money-laundering scheme.

01:10:05.636 --> 01:10:08.247
So far, only the branch manager

01:10:08.247 --> 01:10:11.468
has been charged by the
Anti-Money Laundering Council.

01:10:11.468 --> 01:10:14.384
One of the great
injustices of this whole scandal

01:10:14.384 --> 01:10:17.343
is that the only person who
got convicted of anything

01:10:17.343 --> 01:10:18.953
was Maia Deguito,

01:10:18.953 --> 01:10:22.696
and she was just the mid-level
branch manager of the RCBC,

01:10:22.696 --> 01:10:26.874
the bank in the Philippines
that received the actual funds.

01:10:26.874 --> 01:10:28.180
Typical, isn't it?

01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:30.965
A crime that was conceived
and carried out

01:10:30.965 --> 01:10:32.402
by a whole bunch of men,

01:10:32.402 --> 01:10:35.535
and the only person who
gets done for it is a woman

01:10:35.535 --> 01:10:38.538
who probably wasn't that
guilty in the first place.

01:10:38.538 --> 01:10:41.802
But she received a sentence
of 56 years in jail

01:10:41.802 --> 01:10:44.979
and a fine of $109 million,

01:10:44.979 --> 01:10:49.506
which is significantly more
than the thieves actually stole.

01:10:50.985 --> 01:10:52.291
To my mind,

01:10:52.291 --> 01:10:54.424
there's no question
that she was a scapegoat.

01:10:54.424 --> 01:10:58.297
I mean, the currency traders
who turned that $81 million

01:10:58.297 --> 01:11:01.300
into pesos got off scot-free.

01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:03.737
There are a couple of
Chinese operators

01:11:03.737 --> 01:11:06.566
who brought these gamblers
in from China.

01:11:06.566 --> 01:11:10.396
We know that they received tens
of millions of dollars in cash.

01:11:10.396 --> 01:11:15.314
They vanished back to Macau.
No trace of them was ever found.

01:11:15.314 --> 01:11:17.751
We can't say for sure,
but certainly it looks like

01:11:17.751 --> 01:11:20.798
people at the Rizal Bank headquarters

01:11:20.798 --> 01:11:23.888
buried these requests
to stop these transactions.

01:11:23.888 --> 01:11:27.239
But nobody else at the Rizal
Bank was ever accused.

01:11:27.239 --> 01:11:31.199
Oddly enough, in this giant
scheme that involved

01:11:31.199 --> 01:11:34.986
a half a dozen countries,
nearly $1 billion,

01:11:34.986 --> 01:11:40.208
only one bank employee
in a small branch in Manila

01:11:40.208 --> 01:11:42.646
was ever convicted of
doing anything wrong.

01:11:42.646 --> 01:11:46.040
It's incredible. Total impunity.

01:11:52.395 --> 01:11:54.788
I think the most
important lesson

01:11:54.788 --> 01:11:57.878
of the Bangladesh Bank

01:11:57.878 --> 01:11:59.880
is a lesson of scale.

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:01.882
The internet is
a fantastic thing.

01:12:01.882 --> 01:12:04.320
It's made our world
much, much smaller.

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:07.061
You can do all sorts of things.
It's fantastic.

01:12:07.061 --> 01:12:08.933
But that interconnectivity,

01:12:08.933 --> 01:12:11.805
where everything
is linked to everything else,

01:12:11.805 --> 01:12:15.418
means that if you get bad actors
in that system,

01:12:15.418 --> 01:12:17.245
then the damage

01:12:17.245 --> 01:12:22.076
is infinitely more immense
than it was before.

01:12:23.687 --> 01:12:25.993
When I started this job
two decades ago,

01:12:25.993 --> 01:12:29.083
you had to explain to people,
what is a virus?

01:12:29.083 --> 01:12:31.042
What is a cyber-attack?

01:12:31.042 --> 01:12:33.392
Today, we don't talk about

01:12:33.392 --> 01:12:36.439
making sure this file doesn't
get deleted any more.

01:12:36.439 --> 01:12:40.573
We literally talk about making
sure the supply chain is up,

01:12:40.573 --> 01:12:42.619
food can reach people's tables.

01:12:42.619 --> 01:12:45.665
Our job is not just to protect
people's computers.

01:12:45.665 --> 01:12:49.060
Our job is to ensure
society is up and running.

01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:52.063
Everything
that we use now,

01:12:52.063 --> 01:12:53.978
water, electricity,

01:12:53.978 --> 01:12:56.937
the financial system,
the comms system,

01:12:56.937 --> 01:12:58.548
depends on the integrity

01:12:58.548 --> 01:13:03.683
of unbelievably complex
networked computer systems.

01:13:03.683 --> 01:13:07.992
And our dependence
is becoming such

01:13:07.992 --> 01:13:10.386
that, should anything go wrong,

01:13:10.386 --> 01:13:13.171
be it a technical hitch
or be it a hack,

01:13:13.171 --> 01:13:17.131
it can actually lead
to our lives grinding to a halt

01:13:17.131 --> 01:13:19.525
in a very short space of time.

01:13:20.483 --> 01:13:22.136
We're sort of in a state

01:13:22.136 --> 01:13:24.617
where we're increasing
our vulnerability

01:13:24.617 --> 01:13:27.359
and our attack surface
every single day.

01:13:27.359 --> 01:13:29.796
And instead of pausing

01:13:29.796 --> 01:13:32.799
and thinking about
how to lock up our power grid,

01:13:32.799 --> 01:13:37.848
really, where our energy has
been focused is on escalation.

01:13:37.848 --> 01:13:41.373
Countries like the United
States, China and Russia

01:13:41.373 --> 01:13:44.550
have already arrogated
the right to themselves

01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:47.335
to attack with full force,

01:13:47.335 --> 01:13:50.034
whether cyber
or conventional weapons,

01:13:50.034 --> 01:13:51.905
against anyone who brings down

01:13:51.905 --> 01:13:56.519
a serious piece of critical
national infrastructure.

01:13:56.519 --> 01:14:01.480
We've had Stuxnet blowing
up the Natanz centrifuge plant.

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:04.962
We've had ransomware attacks,
which hit the Eastern Seaboard.

01:14:04.962 --> 01:14:07.007
There was no gas
to the Eastern Seaboard

01:14:07.007 --> 01:14:09.619
for a whole week
in the United States.

01:14:09.619 --> 01:14:11.751
We had Russia
against the Ukraine,

01:14:11.751 --> 01:14:14.537
shutting out the power
in the middle of winter.

01:14:14.537 --> 01:14:17.453
We're talking about
people losing their lives.

01:14:17.453 --> 01:14:19.019
We've also had cyber-attacks

01:14:19.019 --> 01:14:21.413
that potentially affected
US elections.

01:14:21.413 --> 01:14:23.763
We had the healthcare in the UK
brought down,

01:14:23.763 --> 01:14:25.939
dialysis machines
no longer working.

01:14:25.939 --> 01:14:29.421
This is an extremely
fragile situation,

01:14:29.421 --> 01:14:33.599
much more fragile
than the period of détente,

01:14:33.599 --> 01:14:37.255
because so many more
countries have these weapons.

01:14:37.255 --> 01:14:41.389
Malware is much more difficult
to control than nuclear weapons.

01:14:41.389 --> 01:14:44.871
People always warn me
of the cyber Pearl Harbor

01:14:44.871 --> 01:14:47.091
or the cyber 9/11,

01:14:47.091 --> 01:14:49.746
but it's almost worse than that.

01:14:49.746 --> 01:14:53.619
Every day, there are thousands
of cyber-attacks,

01:14:53.619 --> 01:14:58.232
and we're just getting more and
more and more inured to them.

01:14:59.016 --> 01:15:00.887
It's like a plague.

01:15:00.887 --> 01:15:05.152
I think we'll see much
more hostile cyber activity,

01:15:05.152 --> 01:15:07.851
much more cyber bank robberies,

01:15:07.851 --> 01:15:09.983
much more cyber espionage.

01:15:09.983 --> 01:15:13.030
We'll see much more cyber war.

01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:15.815
In many ways,
I think we've seen nothing yet.

01:15:15.815 --> 01:15:19.253
As attacks increase
in their sophistication

01:15:19.253 --> 01:15:21.386
and their range,

01:15:21.386 --> 01:15:25.346
then the impact
can be ever greater.

01:15:25.346 --> 01:15:29.873
There is a cyber-attack on
critical national infrastructure

01:15:29.873 --> 01:15:31.744
coming to a place near you

01:15:31.744 --> 01:15:35.269
within the next
five to ten years.

01:15:35.269 --> 01:15:38.708
If it's done well,
and if it's really malicious,

01:15:38.708 --> 01:15:41.232
that could be catastrophic.

01:15:43.016 --> 01:15:47.586
What's amazing about the
Bank of Bangladesh heist is...

01:15:47.586 --> 01:15:51.285
they almost walked away
with $1 billion.

01:15:54.071 --> 01:15:56.203
The mistakes that they made

01:15:56.203 --> 01:15:59.990
that led to them only walking
with $81 million

01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:02.862
were literally a typo in a name

01:16:02.862 --> 01:16:05.082
and potentially
not being patient enough,

01:16:05.082 --> 01:16:06.562
waiting just one more hour.

01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:09.913
We could be telling
a completely different story.

01:16:09.913 --> 01:16:11.828
Presumably, these guys

01:16:11.828 --> 01:16:15.309
kept perhaps 95 percent
of that cash.

01:16:15.309 --> 01:16:16.528
You could walk out

01:16:16.528 --> 01:16:18.399
with 95 percent
of what you came in with,

01:16:18.399 --> 01:16:21.838
have nobody trace that money,
no record of it whatsoever,

01:16:21.838 --> 01:16:26.233
and get on a plane with it,
and you're home free.

01:16:26.233 --> 01:16:30.760
Even if you had invested
a year's work,

01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:35.460
that you had recruited
a really decent set of hackers,

01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:39.899
that you had corrupted
bank officials,

01:16:39.899 --> 01:16:43.947
you'll be looking at a profit
of about $75 million.

01:16:43.947 --> 01:16:47.037
For a year's work,
not a bad pay-off.

01:16:49.126 --> 01:16:52.999
The Bank of Bangladesh heist
showed them what was possible.

01:16:54.392 --> 01:16:56.742
They proved that
they could do it.

01:17:01.617 --> 01:17:03.662
After that attack,
it didn't stop.

01:17:03.662 --> 01:17:07.840
We saw continued attacks
on various banks across Asia,

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:10.451
I think in
the Philippines again.

01:17:10.451 --> 01:17:14.673
And also, they started hacking
the cryptocurrency exchanges,

01:17:14.673 --> 01:17:18.546
where people store their Bitcoin
and Monero digital currency,

01:17:18.546 --> 01:17:21.724
which has proved to be
incredibly lucrative for them.

01:17:23.726 --> 01:17:25.684
In 2017,
Lazarus was thought

01:17:25.684 --> 01:17:27.338
to have successfully attacked

01:17:27.338 --> 01:17:31.995
at least five Asian
cryptocurrency exchanges.

01:17:31.995 --> 01:17:37.827
That's a total of
$571 million that was lost.

01:17:37.827 --> 01:17:41.134
Cryptocurrency exchanges
just have the bare minimum

01:17:41.134 --> 01:17:43.659
of security, we're learning now.

01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:46.923
In 2020, as the global
pandemic spiralled,

01:17:46.923 --> 01:17:50.143
AstraZeneca, makers of
one of the key vaccines,

01:17:50.143 --> 01:17:53.538
was hit by an attack,
extorting the company

01:17:53.538 --> 01:17:56.846
and stealing sensitive
information for profit.

01:17:58.064 --> 01:18:00.632
The sums involved
are astronomical,

01:18:00.632 --> 01:18:03.940
and Lazarus is still
very much at large.

01:18:06.246 --> 01:18:11.774
They have been designated
by the United States an APT;

01:18:11.774 --> 01:18:13.863
that's an
advanced persistent threat.

01:18:13.863 --> 01:18:16.692
Now, the fundamental criteria

01:18:16.692 --> 01:18:20.478
is that they represent a threat

01:18:20.478 --> 01:18:24.612
to US national security
and national infrastructure.

01:18:24.612 --> 01:18:28.486
So, just by dint of it
being called an APT

01:18:28.486 --> 01:18:33.404
means that the Lazarus Group
is serious stuff.

01:18:33.404 --> 01:18:35.623
Marvel fans,
think HYDRA.

01:18:35.623 --> 01:18:38.801
James Bond films,
think of SPECTRE.

01:18:38.801 --> 01:18:40.237
It's something like that.

01:18:43.762 --> 01:18:47.635
Now, it's tempting to
think this comparison is absurd,

01:18:47.635 --> 01:18:51.074
but this is the scale
that Lazarus operates on.

01:18:51.074 --> 01:18:54.294
Arguably, they're the most
potent cyber criminals

01:18:54.294 --> 01:18:56.427
in business today.

01:18:56.427 --> 01:19:00.300
So the nation state's
involvement in cybercrime

01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:02.955
means that cybercrime
has actually morphed

01:19:02.955 --> 01:19:05.653
into cyber warfare.

01:19:05.653 --> 01:19:08.613
You can have zero trust
in these systems.

01:19:08.613 --> 01:19:12.095
You need to assume that
everything has been broken,

01:19:12.095 --> 01:19:14.010
everything is being listened to,

01:19:14.010 --> 01:19:17.274
that everything can be captured,
and operate accordingly.

01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:22.453
If a small group
can plan something

01:19:22.453 --> 01:19:25.499
and get away with $81 million,

01:19:25.499 --> 01:19:27.937
which involved
the Fed in New York,

01:19:27.937 --> 01:19:29.765
SWIFT in Brussels,

01:19:29.765 --> 01:19:32.550
the Bangladeshi Bank in Dhaka,

01:19:32.550 --> 01:19:36.032
and then all the peripherals
in Manila,

01:19:36.032 --> 01:19:40.427
just think about what one of the
really professional operations

01:19:40.427 --> 01:19:42.560
in China, Russia,

01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:44.518
the NSA, GCHQ,

01:19:44.518 --> 01:19:48.871
just think what havoc
they could wreak.

01:19:48.871 --> 01:19:52.613
And every year, the hacks get
bigger, the damage greater,

01:19:52.613 --> 01:19:54.702
the implications graver.

01:19:56.139 --> 01:20:00.447
Armies literally have hackers
hammering at the gates.

01:20:00.447 --> 01:20:02.710
And it just takes
a simple breach,

01:20:02.710 --> 01:20:05.583
one person, one weak link,

01:20:05.583 --> 01:20:08.238
and those armies
will storm the defences

01:20:08.238 --> 01:20:12.851
and bring down a network
that our way of life depends on.

01:20:12.851 --> 01:20:15.593
It happened in Bangladesh
in 2016.

01:20:15.593 --> 01:20:21.033
And believe you me, it's going
to happen again very soon.

01:21:14.957 --> 01:21:17.916
