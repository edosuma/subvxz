00:17.400 --> 00:20.080

since the car crash</i>

00:20.080 --> 00:23.760
<i>that tragically cut short
the life of your son and Princess Diana.</i>

00:24.440 --> 00:28.040
<i>In that time, there have been
autopsies, coroner's reports,</i>

00:28.040 --> 00:31.640
not to mention a two-year investigation
led by a judge in France,

00:31.640 --> 00:34.240
all concluding that it was an accident.

00:35.120 --> 00:39.480
And yet you still refuse
to let this issue rest. Why?

00:40.320 --> 00:42.440
Because it was not an accident.

00:43.720 --> 00:44.960
It was murder.

00:44.960 --> 00:46.040
Slaughter.

00:46.920 --> 00:48.040
Committed by whom?

00:48.560 --> 00:50.800
The Dracula British royal family.

00:51.320 --> 00:53.320
These people are gangsters.

00:54.200 --> 00:55.360
Terrorists.

00:56.320 --> 01:00.680
When they discovered Princess Diana
was pregnant with a Muslim child,

01:00.680 --> 01:02.080
they killed her.

01:03.280 --> 01:04.920
So, the British royal family?

01:04.920 --> 01:06.280
Not them personally.

01:07.600 --> 01:12.160
Their intelligence services.
MI5, MI6, MI7.

01:12.160 --> 01:13.840
All the James Bonds.

They murdered
that beautiful, innocent girl and my Dodi

01:20.360 --> 01:24.480
with special military equipment
and flashing lights.

01:24.480 --> 01:27.160
I have new evidence.

01:27.960 --> 01:31.800
Expert witnesses and CCTV tapes.

01:32.840 --> 01:35.640
And I will have my justice.

In recent weeks, Mr. Al Fayed has
spoken to NBC, CNN, ITV, and the BBC.

01:46.360 --> 01:50.840
Not to mention <i>The Mirror</i>, which he has
used as a frequent forum for his views,

01:50.840 --> 01:54.400
and it seems that sympathy
for his crackpot theories

01:54.400 --> 01:55.600
has been growing.

01:55.600 --> 02:02.360
One poll alleges that 78% of Britons
now believe some element of foul play

02:02.360 --> 02:04.480
may have been involved in the crash.

02:05.240 --> 02:09.880
Another makes the claim that 89%
now think it might have been murder.

02:11.680 --> 02:14.800
So I'm afraid I don't think
we've heard the last of this.

15:32.160 --> 15:34.240
- It's not remotely the same.
- Isn't it?

15:36.320 --> 15:38.720
What she went through was far worse.

15:39.320 --> 15:41.440
I get it. It's not easy
having no responsibility

15:41.440 --> 15:44.680
and too much freedom,
but don't you think I'd enjoy the freedom

15:44.680 --> 15:48.000
of not having to be the sensible one?
The reliable one?

15:48.520 --> 15:50.880
And welcome the opportunity
to be the likable rogue.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.120
- No chance.
- Why's that?

15:52.120 --> 15:54.800
To be a likable rogue,
you first need to be likable.

17:45.280 --> 17:47.800
[Elizabeth] So, how was Texas
and President Bush?

17:49.120 --> 17:52.240
[Blair] Productive. And, uh... convivial.

17:53.400 --> 17:55.600
Top of the agenda was, of course, Iraq.

17:57.480 --> 18:01.520
The Americans believe, and we agree,
that Saddam Hussein has amassed

18:01.520 --> 18:04.720
a vast stockpile
of chemical and biological weapons.

18:04.720 --> 18:08.280
But I stressed that,
while Britain always stands ready

18:08.280 --> 18:10.080
to support her number one ally,

18:10.080 --> 18:13.760
in the case of regime change,
our involvement would be contingent

18:13.760 --> 18:17.200
on securing
a second UN Security Council Resolution.

18:17.200 --> 18:19.640
Saddam must allow
the weapons inspectors back in.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.960
Only if he fails to do that

18:21.960 --> 18:25.520
would he be forced to face
the most severe consequences.

18:28.200 --> 18:29.160
War.

18:31.320 --> 18:32.160
Yeah.

18:34.640 --> 18:37.360
The problem with telling someone
you will always back them

18:37.360 --> 18:38.920
and then making it conditional

18:38.920 --> 18:41.120
is they tend to hear
only the offer of support

18:41.120 --> 18:42.560
and not the conditions.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.200
Nevertheless, I'm pleased
the meeting went well

18:46.200 --> 18:49.480
and grateful to you
for... cutting your trip short

18:49.480 --> 18:51.560
so you could be back
in time for the funeral.

18:51.560 --> 18:53.440
It was a very moving ceremony.

18:55.240 --> 18:57.160
And in the end, a great, um...

18:57.720 --> 18:59.880
a great turnout up and down the country.

19:01.800 --> 19:03.920
People needed no encouragement

19:03.920 --> 19:07.560
to show their... their gratitude
for a remarkable public servant.

19:08.360 --> 19:11.520
It gives one great confidence
for your golden jubilee.

19:13.080 --> 19:15.000
If you felt that confident,
Prime Minister,

19:15.000 --> 19:17.760
why have your colleagues
been suggesting to local councils

19:17.760 --> 19:20.800
that they forego charging
for street parties?

19:21.560 --> 19:25.280
Presumably because the interest
in celebrating was so small.

19:25.920 --> 19:27.920
I honestly see no need for concern, but...

19:29.640 --> 19:32.160
but if one wanted to be 100% sure,

19:34.480 --> 19:35.760
there's sometimes, um...

19:36.480 --> 19:39.880
an advantage in bringing
someone charismatic off the bench,

19:40.400 --> 19:42.840
you know, a super sub to...

19:43.840 --> 19:44.760
uh...

19:46.280 --> 19:48.880
to, uh... expand your appeal.

19:50.480 --> 19:52.720
The Prince of Wales already does so much.

19:52.720 --> 19:55.160
Actually,
I was thinking about Prince William.

19:55.160 --> 19:57.640
He's young, modern, sympathetic.

19:58.520 --> 20:00.000
With enormous star quality.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.520
If I can avoid it,
I don't want to disturb him

20:02.520 --> 20:05.160
at a delicate time
in his university studies.

20:05.680 --> 20:09.360
He's already so upset by the existence
of this police investigation.

20:09.360 --> 20:11.920
I don't see
why they have to stir it all up again.

20:12.800 --> 20:13.840
My understanding is that

20:13.840 --> 20:16.840
since he was the last member
of the family to speak to the princess,

20:16.840 --> 20:19.760
he will be required
at least to give a written statement.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.520
Let's hope
they reach their conclusions quickly,

20:23.520 --> 20:25.000
and we can all move on.

[somber music playing]

20:35.840 --> 20:37.840

21:08.160 --> 21:11.240
- Commissioner Stevens, welcome.
- Your Royal Highness.

21:13.480 --> 21:14.400
Shall we go in?

21:19.520 --> 21:21.160
[Stevens] <i>Sir, I must warn you,</i>

21:21.160 --> 21:23.720
<i>some of these questions
are going to be difficult.</i>

21:24.560 --> 21:25.760
[exhales deeply]

21:26.280 --> 21:29.240
[Stevens] Did Princess Diana
ever express any fears to you

21:29.240 --> 21:32.640
that senior royals
and British intelligence services

21:32.640 --> 21:35.640
were conspiring to plan
an accident in her car?

21:38.320 --> 21:39.280
No.

21:40.560 --> 21:41.520
Never.

21:41.520 --> 21:44.200
Are you aware of a letter
written by the princess

21:44.200 --> 21:46.800
and discovered by her butler,
Paul Burrell,

21:47.360 --> 21:49.560
in which she wrote of her suspicions

21:49.560 --> 21:53.520
that you were plotting
a deliberate brake failure in her vehicle

21:53.520 --> 21:57.600
so as to remove
any obstacles to your remarriage?

21:58.480 --> 22:00.520
What?! No.

22:02.400 --> 22:06.280
[Stevens] We also have a note from
Lord Mishcon, the princess' solicitor,

22:06.280 --> 22:08.240
following a meeting with the princess

22:08.240 --> 22:10.600
and her then private secretary,
Patrick Jephson.

22:11.480 --> 22:13.000
- During the meeting...
- Sir.

22:13.600 --> 22:19.760
...she said that unnamed, reliable sources
had informed her of a conspiracy,

22:20.320 --> 22:23.520
the purpose of which
was her murder or incapacitation.

22:24.160 --> 22:25.800
[Charles] When did she say these things?

22:25.800 --> 22:29.560
[Stevens] We believe she began to
articulate these fears in October 1995.

22:30.280 --> 22:34.240
I'm sorry, but you understand
why it is my duty to ask.

22:36.120 --> 22:39.800
Did you ever contribute to any plans
to assassinate the princess?

22:40.520 --> 22:41.520
Of course not.

22:44.200 --> 22:45.920
I honestly had no idea.

22:46.640 --> 22:52.040
If I'd known things had got... that bad,
I'd have done something. Immediately.

22:52.960 --> 22:53.800
Helped.

22:55.760 --> 22:56.800
This is terrible.

22:58.760 --> 23:02.480
What a wretched state of mind she must
have been in even to imagine such things.

23:09.920 --> 23:12.080
Can you, um... close the...

23:14.520 --> 23:16.840
[Stevens] Did your sons,
William and Harry...

25:21.960 --> 25:23.600
[Elizabeth] <i>You are sweet for coming.</i>

25:25.440 --> 25:28.480
I hope I didn't drag you
all the way from Scotland.

25:28.480 --> 25:30.160
Have I come far, you mean?

25:30.160 --> 25:31.320
[chuckling] Oh yes.

25:31.320 --> 25:33.120
- Have you come far?
- [both chuckle]

25:33.120 --> 25:34.080
Granny.

25:37.800 --> 25:40.080
Well, actually, it's...
it's been reading week.

25:40.080 --> 25:43.600
- So I've been at Highgrove for a few days.
- Oh, that must be nice.

25:43.600 --> 25:44.960
It's quite nice.

25:44.960 --> 25:48.040
Though we had the police come in
to ask questions about Mummy

25:48.040 --> 25:49.800
as part of that investigation.

25:49.800 --> 25:51.240
That makes me so cross.

25:52.120 --> 25:54.880
And things aren't too great
between Harry and Pa right now.

25:55.440 --> 25:59.400
Yes, I heard that.
Something about a brawl at a local pub.

25:59.400 --> 26:01.760
More than one. And the wacky baccy.

26:02.280 --> 26:03.400
The what?

26:04.160 --> 26:05.240
The ganja, Granny.

26:07.080 --> 26:08.080
The marijuana?

26:09.880 --> 26:11.080
[Elizabeth] Oh...

26:11.080 --> 26:13.680
So now, whenever Pa goes away, he insists

26:13.680 --> 26:18.240
Harry be sent to a family friend's
to be supervised, which Harry hates.

26:18.760 --> 26:21.720
It's not easy being the number two.

26:23.840 --> 26:26.480
Especially if you have a lot of spirit.

26:26.480 --> 26:27.400
No.

26:29.280 --> 26:32.400
It's not all that easy
being number one either, is it?

26:32.400 --> 26:33.560
Well, you'd know.

26:34.680 --> 26:38.000
University should be about having fun
and growing up.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.320
But you can't have fun

26:39.320 --> 26:42.520
when you've got photographers
and police officers with you

26:42.520 --> 26:43.920
wherever you go.

26:43.920 --> 26:46.000
You certainly can't go
on a date with a girl.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.080
Ah, yes, I wanted to ask you
about all that.

26:48.080 --> 26:53.120
Or even be seen with one without someone
predicting wedding bells before long.

26:54.720 --> 26:56.080
And there's the other stuff.

26:56.960 --> 26:57.840
What other stuff?

26:57.840 --> 27:00.680
Speculation about how the monarchy,

27:00.680 --> 27:05.320
in order to stay popular and relevant,
should skip a generation in favor of me.

27:06.800 --> 27:08.240
Well, that's just nonsense.

27:08.760 --> 27:10.840
Well, I know that. You know that.

27:11.400 --> 27:14.320
But the people don't know that.
They only know what they read.

27:15.280 --> 27:17.240
And then it gets really confusing

27:17.240 --> 27:20.840
because... the more they believe
the rubbish they read,

27:20.840 --> 27:23.800
the more it affects
the way they behave with me, and the more

27:24.320 --> 27:26.280
it ends up becoming my reality somehow.

27:27.920 --> 27:28.800
Yes.

27:32.240 --> 27:35.720
I'm so pleased
you feel able to speak from the heart

27:35.720 --> 27:37.320
and tell me these things.

27:40.360 --> 27:41.920
I also wanted to...

27:43.400 --> 27:44.720
to speak from the heart

27:44.720 --> 27:47.480
and ask for your help
with my golden jubilee.

27:47.480 --> 27:50.680
Because I don't mind admitting
I'm a little apprehensive about it.

27:52.400 --> 27:53.960
Particularly the balcony.

27:55.880 --> 27:58.640
The idea I might step out to no crowds,

27:58.640 --> 28:00.360
just a big, empty space.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.720
Or worse, booing.

28:05.160 --> 28:06.720
And letting everyone down.

28:07.600 --> 28:11.320
- It's never going to happen.
- You say that, but what if it does?

28:13.000 --> 28:15.280
And I had hoped to be able to ask you

28:15.280 --> 28:18.000
as a younger
and more glamorous member of the family

28:18.000 --> 28:19.200
to come in and...

28:19.840 --> 28:20.960
and prop me up.

28:23.480 --> 28:27.040
But in the light of what you've
just told me, I'll say something else.

28:28.520 --> 28:30.040
Stay well clear.

28:31.200 --> 28:32.360
[William] Are you sure?

28:33.960 --> 28:36.080
Before I acceded to the throne,

28:36.080 --> 28:39.360
Philip and I lived in Malta
as a young married couple.

28:40.600 --> 28:42.840
Villa Guardamangia was our home.

28:43.880 --> 28:45.080
Outside Valletta.

28:48.080 --> 28:50.320
Some of the happiest years of my life.

28:52.720 --> 28:53.640
Hm.

28:56.200 --> 28:59.920
I used to go to the grocers, you know,
every day. With all the other wives.

28:59.920 --> 29:01.000
[William chuckles]

29:01.560 --> 29:04.000
And held dinner parties and picnics.

29:05.680 --> 29:07.480
And went to the local hairdresser.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.680
Out of the spotlight.
Living a perfectly normal life.

29:12.640 --> 29:14.160
I want you to have that too.

29:15.600 --> 29:19.080
As normal a life as possible.
For as long as possible.

29:19.760 --> 29:21.880
- I'm doing my best.
- Good.

29:23.440 --> 29:25.560
And on that note, since you wanted to ask...

29:25.560 --> 29:26.480
Mm-hmm.

29:27.600 --> 29:30.200
- I think I might have a girlfriend.
- Oh. [chuckles]

29:32.120 --> 29:33.800
Well, do you or don't you?

29:33.800 --> 29:35.840
I do.... I think.

29:35.840 --> 29:38.520
It's generally good if they don't feel
you're in two minds.

29:38.520 --> 29:40.040
I'm not in two minds.

29:40.960 --> 29:42.720
She might be in two minds.

29:43.240 --> 29:45.400
Why? Have you aimed high?

29:46.640 --> 29:47.720
Impossibly high.

29:48.800 --> 29:49.880
She could have anyone.

29:49.880 --> 29:52.720
Some might say
you're a bit of a catch too.

29:52.720 --> 29:54.960
- Did you meet her at university?
- Mm.

29:54.960 --> 29:58.640
- Yes. We're on the same course.
- Oh. Is she Scottish?

29:58.640 --> 30:01.440
I'm not sure there are
any real Scots at St. Andrews.

30:01.440 --> 30:03.680
- She's from Berkshire.
- Nothing wrong with that.

30:03.680 --> 30:07.320
- It's where we keep most of our horses.
- [chuckles] Her name is Catherine.

30:07.840 --> 30:11.000
- Nothing wrong with that either.
- She wants me to meet her parents.

30:11.600 --> 30:13.040
Mm. Isn't that a bit quick?

30:13.040 --> 30:15.240
Well, not as a commitment thing.

30:15.240 --> 30:17.720
Because... she likes being with them

30:17.720 --> 30:20.680
and wants me to come and... hang out.

30:22.680 --> 30:23.520
How nice.

30:24.400 --> 30:26.240
Apparently, they eat together.

30:26.880 --> 30:27.800
In the kitchen.

30:28.800 --> 30:30.360
Why? Do they not have a dining room?

30:30.360 --> 30:33.080
I think they do. They just--

30:33.080 --> 30:34.840
Prefer to behave like staff?

30:36.320 --> 30:38.160
[both chuckle]

30:38.160 --> 30:40.160
We'll try not to hold that against them.

30:40.160 --> 30:41.080
[both chuckle]

30:41.080 --> 30:42.000
Yeah.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.200
[William] <i>Well, I told her all about you.</i>

30:44.880 --> 30:45.720
Wow.

30:46.600 --> 30:48.520
So the Queen knows who I am.

30:48.520 --> 30:49.720
<i>More than that.</i>

30:49.720 --> 30:51.600
She hopes to meet you one day.

30:52.840 --> 30:53.880
<i>Amazing.</i>

30:55.280 --> 30:56.560
Doesn't that terrify you?

30:57.440 --> 30:58.280
Why?

30:59.560 --> 31:01.520
You always say how great she is.

31:01.520 --> 31:03.040
<i>Yeah, I do.</i>

31:03.600 --> 31:05.720
And how protective she is of you.

31:05.720 --> 31:07.000
<i>She really is.</i>

31:07.000 --> 31:10.080
She just gave me a pass
to skip most of the jubilee events.

31:11.760 --> 31:14.040
<i>So, you could come and watch with us?</i>

31:15.600 --> 31:17.160
What, with your family?

31:17.160 --> 31:19.160
You could give a running commentary.

31:19.160 --> 31:20.680
[both chuckle]

31:20.680 --> 31:22.560
With a unique insight. [chuckles]

31:22.560 --> 31:23.800

31:25.880 --> 31:29.800
Can we see how the next few days go first?
With the police inquiry.

31:30.440 --> 31:33.520
<i>- They're about to publish their findings.
- </i>  Of course.

31:34.360 --> 31:36.280
I didn't realize. I'm so sorry.

31:36.280 --> 31:37.280
[exhales]

31:37.280 --> 31:38.360
It's okay.

31:39.360 --> 31:40.840
<i>I'll be thinking of you.</i>

31:42.120 --> 31:44.240
- [cameras clicking]

31:46.320 --> 31:47.600
[Stevens] Good afternoon.

31:47.600 --> 31:48.920
[crowd hushes]

31:48.920 --> 31:51.360
As commissioner
of the Metropolitan Police,

31:51.360 --> 31:53.640
I was asked to conduct a new inquiry

31:53.640 --> 31:57.560
into the deaths of Diana,
Princess of Wales, and Dodi Fayed.

31:58.480 --> 32:01.200
This investigation follows
a high-profile campaign

32:01.200 --> 32:03.160
by Mohamed Al Fayed,

32:03.160 --> 32:06.280
in which he accused
members of the British royal family

32:06.280 --> 32:08.520
of deliberately causing the accident.

32:08.520 --> 32:10.200
[indistinct conversation]

32:10.200 --> 32:12.000
[Stevens] <i>Prior to publication,</i>

32:12.000 --> 32:16.760
<i>I have consulted with Princes William
and Harry about the report's conclusions.</i>

32:17.600 --> 32:21.520
<i>They were given the opportunity
to ask questions and to express concerns,</i>

32:22.040 --> 32:26.880
<i>and I assured them that the investigation
was evidence-led at all times.</i>

32:28.760 --> 32:30.920
[tense percussive music playing]

32:30.920 --> 32:32.960
[Stevens] <i>We have interviewed
over 300 witnesses...</i>

32:32.960 --> 32:35.160
- Welcome to the Ritz.
<i>- </i>  Monsieur Rocher.

32:35.160 --> 32:37.080
<i>...returned to multiple locations...</i>

32:38.920 --> 32:40.320
The Imperial Suite.

32:41.080 --> 32:45.000
<i>...to conduct re-examinations,
and using the latest forensic technology,</i>

32:45.520 --> 32:48.880
<i>we have collected and examined
over 600 pieces of evidence,</i>

32:49.560 --> 32:53.120
<i>as well as reviewing
hundreds of hours of CCTV footage</i>

32:53.120 --> 32:55.840
<i>in order to reconstruct
the events of that night.</i>

32:56.560 --> 33:00.720
I'd like to respond
to some of Mr. Al Fayed's claims.

33:01.680 --> 33:04.280
<i>From the evidence
of close friends and associates,</i>

33:04.800 --> 33:08.480
<i>we learned that the princess
was not engaged,</i>

33:09.280 --> 33:10.920
<i>nor about to get engaged,</i>

33:11.520 --> 33:13.680
<i>nor, indeed, wished to get engaged.</i>

33:14.280 --> 33:16.040
<i>We also found no evidence</i>

33:16.040 --> 33:19.200
<i>that the princess was pregnant
at the time of her death,</i>

33:19.840 --> 33:24.760
<i>and forensic tests carried out on blood
recovered from the Mercedes support this.</i>

33:26.400 --> 33:31.200
<i>Another of Mr. Al Fayed's allegations
is that British security services</i>

33:31.200 --> 33:34.640
<i>tampered with the blood sample
of the driver, Henri Paul,</i>

33:35.240 --> 33:38.800
to create a false impression
of high alcohol levels.

33:39.400 --> 33:43.320
<i>Our examination of toxicology reports
found no such evidence.</i>

33:44.000 --> 33:46.480
<i>Indeed, several witnesses
saw Monsieur Paul</i>

33:46.480 --> 33:50.800
<i>drinking in the Ritz Hotel
before electing to drive the car.</i>

33:51.600 --> 33:54.840
Mr. Al Fayed has also
made varying allegations

33:54.840 --> 33:57.160
surrounding the role of a white Fiat Uno.

33:58.360 --> 33:59.600
<i>He has alternately claimed</i>

33:59.600 --> 34:02.600
<i>that this vehicle
deliberately blocked the Mercedes' path,</i>

34:03.520 --> 34:05.240
<i>clashed with it directly,</i>

34:05.240 --> 34:07.480
<i>or forced it into pillar 13.</i>

34:08.000 --> 34:09.120
[camera clicking]

34:09.120 --> 34:13.720
<i>And while the Mercedes did have
a close encounter with the Fiat Uno,</i>

34:13.720 --> 34:17.560
<i>forensic tests have determined
that this was not the cause of the crash.</i>

34:17.560 --> 34:19.200
[engines revving]

34:20.960 --> 34:24.920
<i>Though no video footage exists
from the Pont de l'Alma tunnel,</i>

34:24.920 --> 34:28.840
<i>using the latest advances
in 3D computer modeling,</i>

34:29.360 --> 34:31.800
<i>we have been able to reconstruct
what took place.</i>

34:32.640 --> 34:36.480
Mr. Al Fayed also alleges
that a bright flash of light

34:36.480 --> 34:39.120
was seen in the tunnel
at the time of the crash,

34:39.760 --> 34:41.760
designed to blind the driver.

34:42.400 --> 34:47.000
Even if such a flash had existed,
it would have had little significance,

34:47.680 --> 34:53.320
<i>as Monsieur Paul was traveling
at approximately 100 kilometers an hour...</i>

34:56.120 --> 34:57.760
[camera clicks, whirs]

34:57.760 --> 35:01.800
<i>...and had already lost control of the car
prior to entering the tunnel.</i>

35:04.560 --> 35:07.320
The most significant factor in the crash

35:07.320 --> 35:09.880
was the assignment
of Henri Paul as driver.

35:10.920 --> 35:12.200
Not only was he drunk,

35:12.720 --> 35:14.560
but he was unqualified
to drive the vehicle

35:15.720 --> 35:18.240
<i>and driving
at twice the legal speed limit.</i>

35:18.840 --> 35:21.200
<i>And to add to the safety risk,</i>

35:22.160 --> 35:24.680
none of the passengers wore a seatbelt.

35:25.440 --> 35:28.840
<i>Mr. Al Fayed has repeatedly insisted</i>

35:28.840 --> 35:31.240
<i>that responsibility
for the princess' death</i>

35:31.240 --> 35:33.480
<i>lies with the British establishment</i>

35:34.240 --> 35:39.200
<i>and has amassed a vast legal team
to attempt to prove as much.</i>

35:39.920 --> 35:42.280
<i>But this reaction must be viewed</i>

35:42.280 --> 35:45.640
<i>in the light
of the immense personal heartbreak</i>

35:45.640 --> 35:48.200
<i>and trauma involved in the loss of a son.</i>

35:50.360 --> 35:51.600
<i>Yet the facts remain</i>

35:52.920 --> 35:55.680
that on August 31st, 1997,

35:56.200 --> 35:57.960
Princess Diana was in Paris,

35:59.080 --> 36:01.200
being driven in an Al Fayed car

36:02.080 --> 36:04.320
by a member of Mr. Al Fayed's staff

36:05.560 --> 36:08.240
with bodyguards paid for by Mr. Al Fayed

36:09.920 --> 36:15.080
and acting on a last-minute change of plan
instigated by Mr. Al Fayed's son.

36:17.400 --> 36:21.200
This was a series of unfortunate incidents

36:21.200 --> 36:23.720
leading to a tragic accident in a tunnel,

36:24.920 --> 36:27.800
and it is the recommendation
of this inquiry

36:28.400 --> 36:33.720
<i>that the princess should finally
be allowed to rest in peace.</i>

42:21.240 --> 42:22.240
<i>Thank you.</i>

42:22.240 --> 42:24.320
[crowd applauding on TV]

42:32.640 --> 42:33.920
[somber music fades out]

42:33.920 --> 42:37.480
You're naughty. You shouldn't be helping.
It should be James or Pippa!

42:37.480 --> 42:40.040
- [chuckles] It's okay.
- Come on, give these to me.

42:41.400 --> 42:42.440
[grunts softly]

42:42.440 --> 42:44.360
[fanfare playing on TV]

42:44.360 --> 42:45.280
Oh, wow.

42:46.080 --> 42:47.160
Baked it herself.

42:47.760 --> 42:49.840
- Mum!
- It smells amazing.

42:49.840 --> 42:51.760
[man speaking on TV indistinctly]

42:51.760 --> 42:54.200
- Thank you.
- I'll take the plates through.

42:55.320 --> 42:57.680
I put the cream on it
and then the strawberries,

42:57.680 --> 43:01.360
but once it's cooled down,
otherwise, it just sort of melts and...

43:04.200 --> 43:05.320
Are you all right?

43:06.160 --> 43:10.120
[William] I was just thinking,
after the lunch... she's got the parade.

43:11.520 --> 43:14.800
[sighs] And after the parade,
she's got the dreaded balcony, and...

43:14.800 --> 43:15.720
Yeah.

43:19.400 --> 43:21.920
I know she gave me a pass
to miss it all, but...

43:24.720 --> 43:25.960
I can't help feeling...

43:28.040 --> 43:29.400
that I should be with her.

43:29.400 --> 43:32.480
[somber music playing]

43:34.440 --> 43:36.440
[exhales deeply]

43:57.080 --> 43:58.160
[Philip] It's time.

43:59.960 --> 44:01.040
Are you all right?

44:03.200 --> 44:04.120
I'm fine.

44:06.520 --> 44:07.400
Come.

44:08.480 --> 44:10.480
[distant clock bell tolling]

44:26.560 --> 44:28.560
[crowd chattering]

44:30.040 --> 44:32.040
[horn honking]

44:32.640 --> 44:34.120
[whistling]

44:39.800 --> 44:41.800
[muffled cheers in distance]

44:45.360 --> 44:47.360
[cheering swells]

45:14.760 --> 45:15.760
[exclaims softly]

45:36.760 --> 45:37.840
[speaks indistinctly]

45:41.160 --> 45:43.160
[cheering grows louder]

45:47.960 --> 45:48.920
It's William!

46:05.520 --> 46:07.720
[cheering fades]

46:07.720 --> 46:10.680
[Kate] <i>Well, that was a big hit.</i>

46:10.680 --> 46:11.600
Yeah.

46:12.520 --> 46:15.600
<i>And the Queen must have been so happy
that you went after all.</i>

46:16.360 --> 46:17.360
I think so.

46:19.760 --> 46:20.760
Are you okay?

46:21.320 --> 46:22.600
<i>Yeah, it's just...</i>

46:24.000 --> 46:26.360
it makes you realize
the pressures of the job.

46:31.600 --> 46:32.800
A change of subject?

46:32.800 --> 46:33.960
Please.

46:33.960 --> 46:35.440
[both chuckling]

46:35.440 --> 46:37.560
<i>So, when are you going back?</i>

46:38.080 --> 46:39.280
Uh, to St. Andrews?

46:39.280 --> 46:40.280
<i>Yeah.</i>

46:40.280 --> 46:44.160
Uh... tomorrow. I'm looking at
a couple of houses for next year.

46:44.160 --> 46:45.240
Oh.

46:46.160 --> 46:48.120
Have you decided
who you're going to live with?

46:48.120 --> 46:50.120
- <i>Fergus.</i>
- Of course.

46:50.120 --> 46:51.720
- <i>And Olivia.
- </i>  Nice.

46:53.040 --> 46:55.320
There's this place on Hope Street
which looks good.

46:56.120 --> 46:57.120
Big windows.

46:58.680 --> 46:59.840
I like Hope Street.

47:02.200 --> 47:05.360
But it's got four bedrooms,
and there's just three of us.

47:05.360 --> 47:06.480
<i>Ah...</i>

47:06.480 --> 47:07.520
Unless

47:08.800 --> 47:10.680
you happen to know a fourth?

47:11.400 --> 47:14.440
<i>Well, were you thinking a boy or a girl?</i>

47:15.160 --> 47:18.560
[William] <i>Probably a girl. To keep things...</i>

47:18.560 --> 47:20.640
- [Kate] <i>Civilized.</i>
- [both chuckle]

47:20.640 --> 47:21.720
[William] <i>Exactly.</i>

47:21.720 --> 47:23.040
Looks very nice.

47:23.040 --> 47:26.280
- [William] <i>Would you consider it?</i>
- [Kate] <i>Is that an invitation?</i>

47:27.200 --> 47:29.560
- [William] <i>I would have to ask the others.</i>
- [Kate] <i>Of course.</i>

47:29.560 --> 47:31.800
[William] <i>But I'm sure they'll approve.</i>

47:31.800 --> 47:33.880
- [thunder rumbling]
- [rain pattering]

47:33.880 --> 47:37.120
- [indistinct conversation]
- [soft instrumental music builds]

47:37.120 --> 47:38.240
[Kate chuckles]

47:59.600 --> 48:00.440
[Kate yelps]

48:08.600 --> 48:09.640
- Evening, sir.
- Will!

48:10.520 --> 48:11.880
- Thanks, mate.
- [door shuts]

48:12.920 --> 48:14.400
- Everything all right?
- Ah.

48:14.920 --> 48:16.240
This arrived for you.

48:16.920 --> 48:18.200
[cork pops]

48:18.200 --> 48:19.920
[liquid pouring]

48:33.200 --> 48:35.200
[laughter and chattering]

48:40.040 --> 48:41.360
Cheers, guys!

48:41.880 --> 48:43.600
- To Hope Street!
- To Hope Street!

48:43.600 --> 48:46.160
[indistinct overlapping chatter]

49:05.480 --> 49:09.080
[soft instrumental music continues]

50:18.600 --> 50:20.400
[soft music fades out]
