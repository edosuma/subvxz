Who knew Eugene was
so light on his crab legs?

20:05.169 --> 20:06.735
[retches]

20:09.039 --> 20:13.042
[both giggling]

20:13.044 --> 20:14.677
- Okay.

20:17.080 --> 20:19.081
- [giggles]

20:19.083 --> 20:19.748
Eugene,

20:19.750 --> 20:22.184
I don't want there to be
any secrets between us.

20:22.186 --> 20:23.953
- What?
Oh!

20:23.955 --> 20:25.087
I'll tell you everything,

20:25.089 --> 20:26.622
no matter how embarrassing.

20:26.624 --> 20:27.590
I wet me bed
till I was 40.

20:27.592 --> 20:30.125
Me armpits sweat smells like
tartar sauce when I'm afraid.

20:30.127 --> 20:32.795
- Not those kinds
of secrets.

20:32.797 --> 20:33.529
- Ooh, okay.

20:33.531 --> 20:36.031
Whatever you want,
me sweet, just ask.

20:36.033 --> 20:37.499
- I want you to tell me...

20:37.501 --> 20:39.735
the secret Krabby Patty
formula.

20:39.737 --> 20:40.603
- The what?

20:40.605 --> 20:41.337
- The secret formula

20:41.339 --> 20:42.538
is locked away
in your heart.

20:42.540 --> 20:45.641
Unlock your heart
for me, Eugene.

20:45.643 --> 20:47.109
Let me in.

20:47.111 --> 20:48.644
- Oh. Okay.

20:48.646 --> 20:50.713
Anything for you,
baby.

20:52.749 --> 20:54.049
I'm gonna whisper it
to you,

20:54.051 --> 20:57.586
just in case there's
any prying ears out there.

20:57.588 --> 21:00.522
- Oh, boy.
Here it comes!

21:00.524 --> 21:03.959
- All right, my sweet.
Here it is.

21:03.961 --> 21:07.062
I'm getting a little
emotional here.

21:07.064 --> 21:08.097
You know,
I never told anyone

21:08.099 --> 21:11.233
the secret Krabby Patty
formula before.

21:11.235 --> 21:14.203
So...here goes.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.607
[electricity zapping]

21:20.543 --> 21:24.847
- Come on, Krabs.
Let it all out.

21:24.849 --> 21:26.282
Uh!
- Plankton?

21:26.284 --> 21:30.152
- No, no! I'm not Plankton.
I'm Cashina.

21:30.154 --> 21:31.920
[laughs]
Your blushing bride.

21:31.922 --> 21:35.190
I'm, uh, uh--
am I blushing?

21:35.192 --> 21:36.592
- You...

21:36.594 --> 21:37.893
monster!

21:37.895 --> 21:39.762
[grunting]

21:39.764 --> 21:41.764
Argh!

21:41.766 --> 21:44.967
- Y-y-you're not gonna
crush me?

21:44.969 --> 21:47.803
- Oh, I've been alone
for so long.

21:47.805 --> 21:50.272
And for the first time
in forever,

21:50.274 --> 21:52.308
I felt for someone.

21:52.310 --> 21:53.042
Well, something.

21:53.044 --> 21:54.877
Well, I mean,
a pile of cash with lips.

21:54.879 --> 21:57.680
It was all
too good to be true.

21:57.682 --> 22:00.215
Cashina may have not
been real,

22:00.217 --> 22:01.250
but me feelings were.

22:01.252 --> 22:04.320
Weren't they?
- Get ahold of yourself, Krabs.

22:04.322 --> 22:08.090
- Plankton, are you saying
it was all just a scheme to you?

22:08.092 --> 22:11.293
You felt nothing?
- You're crazy!

22:11.295 --> 22:12.027
I'm out of here!

22:12.029 --> 22:15.898
And one day, that formula
will be mine!

22:15.900 --> 22:17.232
Mark it!

22:18.802 --> 22:22.204
- [weeping]

22:23.006 --> 22:26.375
[sobbing]

22:29.179 --> 22:30.679
- Oh, hey, buddy.

22:30.681 --> 22:31.413
I want you to know,

22:31.415 --> 22:34.650
even though your wife
just ran out on you,

22:34.652 --> 22:37.186
you still have
to tip me.
