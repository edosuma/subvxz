WEBVTT

00:00.187 --> 00:01.673
Previously on "Greenleaf"...

00:01.700 --> 00:02.733
I have this old friend of mine

00:02.734 --> 00:04.535
is the head of bloomberg news now,

00:04.536 --> 00:07.271
and she keeps asking me whether
I'd be open to come up there.

00:07.272 --> 00:09.006
Good for you.

00:09.007 --> 00:10.474
What was your last church home?

00:10.475 --> 00:13.083
Greater Redeemer. I had breast cancer.

00:13.130 --> 00:15.164
That's why it's so nice
to be here at Calvary.

00:15.165 --> 00:17.833
I really feel supported.

00:17.834 --> 00:19.869
Bishop is definitely one of a kind.

00:19.870 --> 00:22.238
The only one that came
close was Pastor Skanks.

00:22.239 --> 00:24.040
Such a shameless hypocrite.

00:24.041 --> 00:25.908
- You don't know the half of it.
- Kerissa.

00:25.909 --> 00:27.743
Is that the church's
money you lost in there tonight?

00:27.744 --> 00:29.579
Give us Triumph II,
and you don't go to jail.

00:29.580 --> 00:31.781
You keep your church, and we get ours.

00:31.782 --> 00:34.016
Pastor Skanks just spoke
about the need for the church

00:34.017 --> 00:35.885
to take a firm stand against homophobia.

00:35.886 --> 00:37.787
I got a feeling you're
the one with the vision.

00:37.788 --> 00:39.789
Maybe.

00:39.790 --> 00:42.818
You know how many times
I've prayed not to go to jail?

00:43.660 --> 00:45.528
Hundreds.

00:50.434 --> 00:53.537
And to all those folks who want to say,

00:53.937 --> 00:56.272
"the Bible makes it very clear, Pastor,

00:56.273 --> 00:59.675
the Lord's position on this.
We don't need to discuss it."

00:59.676 --> 01:03.946
And I say, "well, let's find out
what else the Lord makes clear,"

01:03.947 --> 01:06.582
amen, because anybody
who wants to shut down

01:06.583 --> 01:09.986
a conversation with me by
slamming the Bible on the table

01:09.987 --> 01:12.888
without discussing what's in it
is going to have a problem...

01:12.889 --> 01:14.924
With me, at least.

01:14.925 --> 01:16.292
Let's see here.

01:16.293 --> 01:19.195
Hebrews 13 and 4 says,

01:19.196 --> 01:21.597
"marriage should be honored by all.

01:21.598 --> 01:24.433
And the marriage bed kept pure."

01:24.434 --> 01:26.602
Y'all know some of y'all
left your boyfriend's bed

01:26.603 --> 01:28.204
to get to church this morning.

01:29.873 --> 01:32.608
And have you heard
what he said about shellfish

01:32.609 --> 01:34.577
in Leviticus 11 and 9.

01:34.578 --> 01:36.879
- Right now.
- I know you have, and, yet,

01:36.880 --> 01:39.248
how many of y'all are heading
down to the shrimp boat

01:39.249 --> 01:42.351
after this to take advantage
of that allyoucaneat buffet?

01:43.587 --> 01:47.490
If we try to ban everyone
who does not follow

01:47.491 --> 01:51.127
every biblical law
from entering that church,

01:51.128 --> 01:53.529
none of us would be
sitting here right now.

01:56.300 --> 01:57.566
You got to understand,

01:57.567 --> 01:59.902
when God looks at each
and every one of you,

01:59.903 --> 02:03.272
he sees you through a prism
of the blood of Jesus.

02:03.273 --> 02:06.342
Without that blood, all our sins
would be laying before us,

02:06.343 --> 02:07.677
people of God.

02:07.678 --> 02:12.248
But through that blood,
we all can find the love of God,

02:12.249 --> 02:15.051
the acceptance of God,
and the oneness of God,

02:15.052 --> 02:19.422
a God who made us, a God who's
in us, and a God who's for us.

02:19.423 --> 02:23.259
Amen. So I say,
to the homosexual community,

02:23.260 --> 02:26.228
there is a place for you among us here

02:26.229 --> 02:28.664
for all of us that are
living under God's Grace.

02:28.665 --> 02:30.384
Amen.

02:31.201 --> 02:33.436
Okay. I see.

02:33.437 --> 02:37.807
It's not enough to say,
"who are we to condemn?

02:37.808 --> 02:39.175
Let God handle that."

02:39.176 --> 02:40.876
- Right.
- Let God handle it.

02:40.877 --> 02:42.345
It's not enough for us to say,

02:42.346 --> 02:45.081
like our brethren at Calvary fellowship,

02:45.082 --> 02:47.950
"all our welcome as long
as you hide who you really are

02:47.951 --> 02:49.752
and don't put nothing on social media."

02:49.753 --> 02:53.723
At a time when the laws of the
land that protect the rights

02:53.724 --> 02:58.161
of our gay brothers and sisters
are being rolled back every day,

02:58.829 --> 03:01.530
it's not enough to say, "God is love."

03:01.531 --> 03:03.499
It's time to get specific.

03:03.500 --> 03:06.836
It's time to say, "God loves gays."

03:06.837 --> 03:08.771
It's time to take a stand.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.074

03:58.989 --> 04:01.056
And then, after preaching for two hours,

04:01.057 --> 04:03.726
he gave an additional
twohour interview on the topic.

04:03.727 --> 04:06.595
But what is it on the front page?

04:06.596 --> 04:09.432
I assume because he called out the city

04:09.433 --> 04:12.268
after rolling back
on that, um, bathroom bill

04:12.269 --> 04:13.602
after what happened in Texas.

04:13.603 --> 04:15.337
- You're right.
- He knows how to get publicity.

04:15.338 --> 04:16.439
Mmhmm.

04:16.440 --> 04:18.808
- Who's that?
- Your new hero,

04:18.809 --> 04:20.743
Basie Skanks.

04:20.744 --> 04:22.711
He's not my hero, Daddy.

04:22.712 --> 04:25.347
I just happen to agree
with him on this one issue.

04:25.348 --> 04:27.149
You look exhausted.

04:27.150 --> 04:28.417
Thanks, mama.

04:28.418 --> 04:31.520
Hey, Charity, baby, take Nathan
for a second, please.

04:31.521 --> 04:33.489
Are you still having trouble sleeping?

04:33.490 --> 04:35.634
Yeah. It'll pass.

04:36.526 --> 04:37.860
Thank you.

04:37.861 --> 04:41.130
Did you know that Darius was
working on a piece about Basie?

04:41.131 --> 04:43.332
Yeah. I haven't read it yet.

04:43.333 --> 04:46.569
And he mentions Calvary in it by name.

04:46.570 --> 04:48.437
Who, Basie?

04:48.438 --> 04:49.738
And Darius.

04:49.739 --> 04:51.207
And he never asked me for a comment.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.641
May I have a look?

04:52.642 --> 04:57.360
He questions whether Basie
is using this whole gay tornado

04:57.361 --> 04:59.582
to spin the spotlight on to himself.

04:59.583 --> 05:03.452
Yes. At the end
of the story, on page 10,

05:03.453 --> 05:05.956
the page that nobody sees but the puppy.

05:06.423 --> 05:07.990
I don't think Darius is saying anything

05:07.991 --> 05:09.625
that's going to make him popular, Daddy.

05:09.626 --> 05:10.893
Not with churches.

05:10.894 --> 05:13.229
I just wish Basie Skanks
would keep me and Calvary

05:13.230 --> 05:14.964
out of his stump speech.

05:14.965 --> 05:17.466
I think he must've interviewed Carlton.

05:17.467 --> 05:19.268
Well, Carlton never said anything to me.

05:19.269 --> 05:21.070
You can't fire him again, mama.

05:21.071 --> 05:22.204
I'd just like to know.

05:22.205 --> 05:23.706
I'll ask him tonight.

05:23.707 --> 05:25.574
He pays when y'all go out, I hope.

05:25.575 --> 05:27.710
Yes, he pays, mama.

05:29.045 --> 05:30.279
May I keep this, Daddy?

05:30.280 --> 05:32.915
Keep it, burn it, so long
as I don't see it again.

05:32.916 --> 05:36.785
See, he doesn't inspire me
the way he inspires you.

05:36.786 --> 05:38.787
Bishop.

05:38.788 --> 05:40.456
I love you.

05:40.457 --> 05:42.491
All right. I'll see y'all at church.

05:42.492 --> 05:45.095
- Say bye.
- Bye.

05:46.663 --> 05:48.998
All right. See y'all later.

05:48.999 --> 05:52.568
Basie... he's doing it again.

05:52.569 --> 05:54.236
And don't know if it's by design

05:54.237 --> 05:56.472
or whether it's some mental fixation,

05:56.473 --> 05:58.474
but he is tugging at the threads

05:58.475 --> 06:00.509
that hold this family together.

06:00.510 --> 06:02.678
You're absolutely right, Mae.

06:02.679 --> 06:05.015
We have to do something to stop this.

06:08.885 --> 06:10.419
What are you thinking?

06:10.420 --> 06:12.688
I think it's time for me and Jesus

06:12.689 --> 06:15.192
to pay a call on Basie Skanks.

06:19.262 --> 06:21.096
All right.

06:21.097 --> 06:23.198
That should do it.

06:23.199 --> 06:24.659
Stand back.

06:32.142 --> 06:33.909
Let there be light!

06:33.910 --> 06:36.211
Do you even know what you did?

06:36.212 --> 06:37.580
Do you have any idea
why it's working now

06:37.581 --> 06:39.648
and it wasn't 10 minutes ago?

06:39.649 --> 06:41.417
I'm just focusing on gratitude.

06:41.418 --> 06:43.804
You are focusing on blasphemy.

06:44.754 --> 06:46.488
This whole house needs to be rewired.

06:46.489 --> 06:49.692
Stan said so. Every electrician
that comes over here says so.

06:49.693 --> 06:50.926
I think Tasha even mentioned it

06:50.927 --> 06:52.494
when she threw the keys at me.

06:52.495 --> 06:55.731
Look, we can't afford
to pay for it right now.

06:55.732 --> 06:57.666
Well, some trade that was.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.945
An empty field and a money pit

07:00.637 --> 07:03.172
all to keep some hypocrite's secret?

07:03.173 --> 07:05.158
Who came out on top of that deal?

07:06.509 --> 07:07.576
You done?

07:07.577 --> 07:09.178
I'll be done when this house

07:09.179 --> 07:12.791
stops twitching like a person possessed.

07:13.249 --> 07:15.544
Zora? Winkie?

07:16.720 --> 07:18.255
Coming.

07:21.257 --> 07:24.293
You know there's cash
in that "go help me" fund.

07:24.294 --> 07:26.095
Unhunh. No, no, no, no.

07:26.096 --> 07:27.663
See, that's what got Basie in trouble,

07:27.664 --> 07:29.498
robbing Peter to pay Paul.

07:29.499 --> 07:31.476
Watch that thieving spirit, baby.

07:31.868 --> 07:34.670
Okay, Pastor. You give me no alternative

07:34.671 --> 07:36.939
but to say something
you're really not going to like.

07:36.940 --> 07:37.940
Try me.

07:37.941 --> 07:39.775
Get a job.

07:39.776 --> 07:41.010
I already have a job.

07:41.361 --> 07:43.078
I'm ready.

07:43.079 --> 07:45.948
Every pastor we know with
a smaller church has a day job.

07:45.949 --> 07:49.318
Amon has his motel 6.
Jay Dalton sells shoes.

07:49.319 --> 07:51.053
Dalton shoes is a family business.

07:51.054 --> 07:53.989
All I'm saying is that,
unless you can figure out a way

07:53.990 --> 07:55.591
to get paid for collecting compliments

07:55.592 --> 07:57.826
about how holy you are right now,

07:57.827 --> 08:01.296
why not use the other six days
to rustle up some scratch?

08:01.297 --> 08:03.065
I can pay the bills,
but I can't make enough

08:03.066 --> 08:05.401
to renovate this money trap.

08:07.103 --> 08:09.004
Mama!

08:09.005 --> 08:10.706
Go see what your brother just turned on.

08:10.707 --> 08:11.850
Okay.

08:14.644 --> 08:16.278
There's nothing to be ashamed about.

08:16.279 --> 08:19.948
- Mommy!
- I'm coming.

08:19.949 --> 08:22.017
Get a job.

08:28.224 --> 08:31.927
- This is the last of them.
- Oy. Oy.

08:31.928 --> 08:33.962
I can throw it all away.

08:33.962 --> 08:36.498
Antoine recovered
most of the hard drive.

08:36.499 --> 08:37.866
No, I'll at least go through it all,

08:37.866 --> 08:39.753
see what the heck it all is.

08:40.470 --> 08:42.071
All right.

08:42.072 --> 08:44.807
Now that you are outreach director,

08:44.808 --> 08:46.875
will you still be preaching?

08:46.876 --> 08:50.279
Not in the foreseeable future.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.880
Well, that's a shame.

08:51.881 --> 08:53.549
Really?

08:53.550 --> 08:54.717
I think you're the only person

08:54.718 --> 08:56.318
in this church to think that.

08:56.319 --> 08:57.853
Wouldn't you miss it?

08:57.854 --> 09:00.022
I don't think so.

09:00.023 --> 09:01.790
Tell you the truth,
I'm still trying to figure out

09:01.791 --> 09:02.958
where I fit in now.

09:04.694 --> 09:05.861
Maybe it's outreach.

09:05.862 --> 09:08.030
Permission to speak freely, Pastor?

09:08.031 --> 09:09.965
Darlene. You don't need permission.

09:09.966 --> 09:14.737
Some folks never fit in
no matter how hard they try,

09:14.738 --> 09:16.138
and that's okay.

09:16.139 --> 09:18.540
I mean, I'm sure not one of the prophets

09:18.541 --> 09:21.836
was ever employee of the month.

09:26.349 --> 09:28.450
Look, I've been in
the hole with you for $50,000.

09:28.451 --> 09:30.052
You know you going to get the money.

09:30.053 --> 09:31.987
Just give me some time.
Tell him to give me two weeks.

09:31.988 --> 09:35.424
That's all. Bishop Greenleaf,
right on time, brother.

09:35.425 --> 09:38.360
If you could excuse us? We got
some church business to tend to.

09:38.361 --> 09:39.394
Man, just don't forget our business.

09:39.395 --> 09:40.629
I will get you those programs

09:40.630 --> 09:42.164
as soon as we get them
back from the printers.

09:42.165 --> 09:44.333
Right. Et cetera. Et cetera.

09:50.106 --> 09:52.307
What an unexpected surprise.

09:52.308 --> 09:53.809
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were on.

09:53.810 --> 09:55.787
God's angelic payroll.

09:56.379 --> 09:58.280
What can I do you for, Bishop?

09:58.281 --> 10:01.617
Stay away from my family.
Stay away from my church.

10:01.618 --> 10:03.919
Don't speak my name.
Don't even think of me.

10:03.920 --> 10:05.554
Well, when you tell a man
not to think something,

10:05.555 --> 10:06.989
it makes it hard.

10:06.990 --> 10:09.792
I don't know what you're up to
with this purple parade

10:09.793 --> 10:11.827
you're now highstepping
in the front of.

10:11.828 --> 10:13.061
I'm just seeking justice for...

10:13.062 --> 10:15.564
You don't know the meaning of the word!

10:15.565 --> 10:18.967
You tried taking me
down with Triumph II.

10:18.968 --> 10:21.103
All you did was make a fool of yourself

10:21.104 --> 10:22.971
and a scene at my son.

10:22.972 --> 10:25.774
And now you're singing this
new siren song to my daughter.

10:25.775 --> 10:27.819
I don't know precisely why,

10:28.645 --> 10:32.748
but I promise you
I won't part with her easily.

10:32.749 --> 10:34.216
I think that's up to her, isn't it?

10:34.217 --> 10:35.994
You're flailing, boy.

10:36.519 --> 10:39.414
I know it, and you know it.

10:40.456 --> 10:43.710
You said the judgment is coming.

10:44.494 --> 10:46.087
It is.

10:48.198 --> 10:50.050
It's coming for you.

10:57.661 --> 11:00.109
Well, I called the man
a fool in his own church.

11:00.110 --> 11:01.477
Told him he was flailing.

11:01.478 --> 11:03.078
And you think he heard you this time?

11:03.079 --> 11:07.082
Because you have cautioned him
before, multiple times.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.651
I couldn't be any clearer.

11:08.652 --> 11:12.188
Now, whether or not he'll heed
my call to reason this time,

11:12.189 --> 11:15.090
or anybody's, well, your guess
is as good as mine.

11:15.091 --> 11:17.660
But, Mae, you should've seen
his face when I walked in there.

11:17.661 --> 11:19.495
Did you notice the other night, James,

11:19.496 --> 11:21.664
when Kerissa and Jacob
came over for dinner...

11:21.665 --> 11:23.766
The way he shut her down
when she talked about Basie?

11:23.767 --> 11:25.267
Yes. Well, yeah. I noticed it.

11:25.268 --> 11:26.735
But do you want to hear my story or not?

11:26.736 --> 11:28.003
I've heard the broad strokes,

11:28.004 --> 11:30.606
and I'll be excited when I see results.

11:30.607 --> 11:32.208
Fine. What is it you're getting at?

11:32.209 --> 11:36.011
Well, I just have a feeling
that there's more to this story

11:36.012 --> 11:39.849
of parting ways with Basie
than they've let on.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.585
Well, let's go over there
tonight and find out.

11:42.586 --> 11:45.287
Over there? Over where?
To the parsonage?

11:45.288 --> 11:47.756
You've always been after me
to give the boy respect.

11:47.757 --> 11:49.191
Why don't we go to him for once?

11:49.192 --> 11:52.261
Maybe it'll loosen his tongue.

11:52.262 --> 11:54.263
- Bishop?
- Yes, Karine?

11:54.264 --> 11:56.065
I have Rochelle Cross on the line.

11:56.066 --> 11:57.132
Tell her I'll call her back.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.701
No. You go on and take the call.

11:58.702 --> 12:00.971
I have Dr. Butler coming over soon.

12:02.973 --> 12:05.140
What do you got going with Jacinta?

12:06.910 --> 12:08.711
Well, I'm just inviting her

12:08.712 --> 12:11.413
to be an honoree
at this year's women's day,

12:11.414 --> 12:14.717
a thank you for getting
the girls into the cotillion.

12:14.718 --> 12:17.319
Is there no ragged end of our world

12:17.320 --> 12:19.722
you're not knitting together?

12:24.127 --> 12:25.895
You give my best to Rochelle.

12:38.208 --> 12:39.642
Ms. Cross?

12:39.643 --> 12:42.578
You know, you were just on my mind.

12:42.579 --> 12:44.372
What can I do for you?

12:44.948 --> 12:48.051
Look, please call me James.

13:00.530 --> 13:03.391
- Where did you get this?
- Kevin's files.

13:03.733 --> 13:05.334
I also did some looking
through the drive

13:05.335 --> 13:07.145
that Antoine recovered.

13:08.038 --> 13:12.508
He was attending meetings,
like, doing the program.

13:12.509 --> 13:14.343
Yes, I know.

13:14.344 --> 13:16.645
They drink ipecac syrup
to make themselves throw up.

13:16.646 --> 13:17.980
For God and heaven's sake.

13:17.981 --> 13:20.516
Selfflagellation.

13:20.517 --> 13:22.918
Daddy, this is why Basie is right.

13:22.919 --> 13:24.620
I know you believe that, Gigi.

13:24.621 --> 13:27.373
- Did you watch his sermons?
- Yeah, I did. I did.

13:28.692 --> 13:30.526
And he's not wrong about the Bible.

13:30.527 --> 13:32.995
Look, there are some folk
who still look at us

13:32.996 --> 13:35.998
the way some of us look at homosexuals.

13:35.999 --> 13:38.100
And I know, just like you do,

13:38.101 --> 13:41.078
I'm sure, what it feels
like to be thought of

13:41.079 --> 13:44.239
as unworthy by another human being

13:44.240 --> 13:47.609
and how hard that can make it
to see through the fog,

13:47.610 --> 13:51.146
to the pure light
of God's total acceptance.

13:51.147 --> 13:52.781
Believe me, I know it all.

13:52.782 --> 13:56.151
Which is why we can't
support this garbage.

13:56.152 --> 13:57.820
We're not doing enough
to support the people

13:57.821 --> 14:01.199
who actually face those challenges.

14:01.958 --> 14:06.562
Kevin came to Calvary every
Sunday for the past eight years,

14:06.563 --> 14:10.599
and he heard you say,
Daddy, "God is love."

14:10.600 --> 14:12.434
But it seems like it didn't get through.

14:12.435 --> 14:14.370
Are you really so scared
that you're going to

14:14.371 --> 14:16.071
send somebody to hell
if you affirm this?

14:16.072 --> 14:17.740
You know I don't think that.

14:17.741 --> 14:19.174
I don't know what you think.

14:19.175 --> 14:22.611
That is the problem
with not taking a stand, Daddy.

14:22.612 --> 14:24.012
Okay. You want to know
what I think, Gigi?

14:24.013 --> 14:26.248
- Yeah.
- I think that only God knows

14:26.249 --> 14:27.883
when the homosexual will be

14:27.884 --> 14:30.219
as welcomed into the church
as anybody else.

14:30.220 --> 14:31.487
You're content to just wait?

14:31.488 --> 14:34.482
No, not content.

14:36.734 --> 14:37.826
Willing.

14:37.827 --> 14:39.795
We got to where we are today,
Gigi, with the help of God,

14:39.796 --> 14:43.699
but we got here slowly,
more slowly than some wanted,

14:43.700 --> 14:45.534
but that's how long it took.

14:45.535 --> 14:47.035
And I expect justice in this realm

14:47.036 --> 14:50.123
will take longer to achieve
than most want to,

14:51.408 --> 14:53.642
but I'm prepared to practice patience.

14:53.643 --> 14:56.478
Because this is a problem that
doesn't affect you specifically.

14:56.479 --> 15:00.925
No, because I know those
that fail to understand

15:01.384 --> 15:03.852
need the love of God as much as those

15:03.853 --> 15:06.889
who are waiting to be understood.

15:07.257 --> 15:09.324
Daddy, patience doesn't
mean standing still,

15:09.325 --> 15:11.519
waiting for something to change.

15:12.195 --> 15:14.930
Patience is lovingly guiding people

15:14.931 --> 15:17.599
who don't understand
into a greater understanding.

15:17.600 --> 15:20.135
You are the leader of this church.

15:20.136 --> 15:22.538
You could be the difference
between it taking 200 years

15:22.539 --> 15:24.940
or mobilizing it right now, today.

15:24.941 --> 15:26.575
- No, I can't.
- Why?

15:26.576 --> 15:28.644
Because I'm not sure.

15:31.214 --> 15:32.648
- Why, Daddy?
- Why what?

15:32.649 --> 15:34.616
Why do we always have to be the ones

15:34.617 --> 15:37.486
who have to circle back
once it's too late?

15:37.487 --> 15:41.466
Just this once, can we
get it right the first time?

15:45.161 --> 15:47.305
I just want to do the right thing.

15:47.664 --> 15:49.223
Me too.

15:53.203 --> 15:55.063
Can you leave these with me?

15:56.739 --> 15:59.609
Sure. Yeah.

16:03.179 --> 16:06.249
I'll pray on it. I promise.

16:10.186 --> 16:11.621
Thank you.

16:23.299 --> 16:24.967
Don't do that for me.

16:24.968 --> 16:26.134
I wasn't. I was just...

16:26.135 --> 16:28.437
I just mean I've never seen
a face that needed

16:28.438 --> 16:31.740
less assistance from
the powder and paint department.

16:31.741 --> 16:34.894
Well, aren't you sweet?

16:35.745 --> 16:37.546
How's it going?

16:37.547 --> 16:38.814
Good.

16:38.815 --> 16:41.650
- Good to see you.
- Nice to see you.

16:41.651 --> 16:44.486
I've had that song of yours
in my head for two weeks now,

16:44.487 --> 16:45.455
nonstop.

16:45.456 --> 16:46.622
And you couldn't make a demo?

16:46.623 --> 16:49.024
No. Nobody sounded quite right,

16:49.025 --> 16:51.360
and, if I'm giving a song
to Nicole mullen,

16:52.078 --> 16:53.295
it needs to be... You know?

16:53.296 --> 16:55.297
Yeah, yeah. I know.

16:55.298 --> 16:58.501
So let me show you what I brought you.

17:02.305 --> 17:06.217
With this bad boy here, in a quiet room,

17:06.709 --> 17:09.053
you can do all your demos here.

17:09.479 --> 17:10.878
That's great.

17:10.880 --> 17:12.247
What's the matter?

17:12.248 --> 17:14.550
It's got a builtin mic,
and a good one, too.

17:14.550 --> 17:16.084
It's not that.

17:16.085 --> 17:18.061
So what's the problem?

17:18.887 --> 17:22.190
So you don't want me to come
to Nashville to write anymore?

17:22.191 --> 17:23.759
No.

17:23.760 --> 17:24.594
You don't.

17:24.595 --> 17:25.861
No, no. I mean yes.

17:25.862 --> 17:28.262
Yes, of course I want you
to come to Nashville.

17:28.263 --> 17:29.765
I just want to make sure
you have all the tools

17:29.766 --> 17:32.834
you need to stay inspired
and that I have the best person

17:32.835 --> 17:35.137
singing the songs I'm selling.

17:35.138 --> 17:37.039
Well, this looks confusing.

17:37.040 --> 17:38.407
It's not.

17:38.408 --> 17:40.543
It's just like anything,
you'll get used to it.

17:41.010 --> 17:42.920
Watch. Let me show you.

17:44.213 --> 17:45.923
You're gonna love this.

17:49.285 --> 17:53.121
I promise all you'll have
to do is just sit there

17:53.122 --> 17:54.856
and just be magnificent.

17:54.857 --> 17:56.925
Then I will gladly accept.

17:56.926 --> 17:58.594
The revisions to this new book of mine

17:58.595 --> 18:00.829
just make additional work impossible.

18:00.830 --> 18:03.699
Well, we won't tax you in the least.

18:03.700 --> 18:05.667
And what a pleasure it will be
to have Greenleaf girls

18:05.668 --> 18:07.069
at the practice dinner tonight.

18:07.070 --> 18:09.471
So exciting.

18:09.472 --> 18:10.706
Yes.

18:10.707 --> 18:12.241
You know...

18:13.743 --> 18:17.012
about that, Rochelle Cross.

18:17.013 --> 18:19.014
She called me on your behalf.

18:19.015 --> 18:21.783
Yeah, a boon for which I am grateful.

18:21.784 --> 18:24.219
Now, how is it you know her exactly?

18:24.220 --> 18:27.789
She's been handling
my finances for, goodness,

18:27.790 --> 18:29.591
several years at this point.

18:29.592 --> 18:31.360
The woman is a wizard with money.

18:31.361 --> 18:33.962
I owe her many times over.

18:33.963 --> 18:35.530
How did you two happen to meet?

18:35.531 --> 18:37.666
She's been attending church services

18:37.667 --> 18:40.936
while she's looking for
a new church home.

18:43.539 --> 18:44.873
I was just so disheartened

18:44.874 --> 18:48.210
to hear about her experience
at Greater Redeemer.

18:49.712 --> 18:51.647
She told you about that?

18:51.648 --> 18:53.407
Yes.

18:54.183 --> 18:57.453
It was a terrible situation.

18:58.855 --> 19:00.389
Well, that's the impression I'm getting.

19:00.390 --> 19:02.290
It's just such a shame
that it's still the woman

19:02.291 --> 19:04.626
who gets blamed
for situations like that,

19:04.627 --> 19:08.930
you know, as if men
have no selfcontrol.

19:08.931 --> 19:11.509
The more things change.

19:12.101 --> 19:14.036
Do me a favor though, Mae?

19:14.037 --> 19:15.070
Anything.

19:15.071 --> 19:17.039
Rochelle doesn't know that I know.

19:17.040 --> 19:19.308
I'll be the soul of discretion.

19:19.809 --> 19:21.647
Thank you.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.814
Thank you.

19:31.189 --> 19:34.865
So the moths absorb the pollution?

19:35.994 --> 19:37.094
That doesn't make sense.

19:37.095 --> 19:38.328
It makes sense.

19:38.329 --> 19:39.579
How?

19:40.899 --> 19:45.835
Okay, so you got to think
about how the pollution

19:46.337 --> 19:49.540
affected everything else
in the environment.

19:49.541 --> 19:53.410
The soot got on the trees.
The trees got darker.

19:53.411 --> 19:56.113
So, the lighter moths, they
didn't blend in well enough,

19:56.114 --> 19:57.447
and they got eaten.

19:57.448 --> 19:58.349
Right?

19:58.350 --> 20:00.050
So the population

20:00.051 --> 20:03.420
selfselected to blend in
and not get eaten.

20:03.421 --> 20:05.354
That's how the moths got darker.

20:12.030 --> 20:14.598
Can we take a break?

20:14.599 --> 20:16.782
We just took a break.

20:18.670 --> 20:21.329
Okay. 10 minutes.

20:23.107 --> 20:24.957
- Two minutes.
- Okay.

20:30.515 --> 20:31.515
Um...

20:31.516 --> 20:33.341
- What was that?
- I'll go see.

20:34.652 --> 20:36.086
Hey. Did you know you can get

20:36.087 --> 20:39.013
two dozen doughnut holes
at glazes for $2.99?

20:39.557 --> 20:40.890
No.

20:48.766 --> 20:50.483
Hey, Pastor Greenleaf.

20:51.936 --> 20:54.862
He's helping me with biology.

20:56.908 --> 20:59.533
- Isaiah?
- Yes, sir.

20:59.844 --> 21:01.411
You want to come out here?

21:01.412 --> 21:03.120
Sure.

21:16.327 --> 21:17.728
Doughnut hole for the road?

21:17.729 --> 21:19.162
Nah, I'm okay.

21:19.163 --> 21:20.631
Now, you know you're not supposed to be

21:20.632 --> 21:22.699
in Zora's room with
the door closed, don't you?

21:22.700 --> 21:24.968
Yeah. I apologize.
I just thought that...

21:24.969 --> 21:26.970
Yeah. So let me think for you.

21:26.971 --> 21:28.438
Okay?

21:28.439 --> 21:29.940
Think about being
respectful under a roof

21:29.941 --> 21:31.141
that doesn't belong to you.

21:31.142 --> 21:32.676
Think about being mindful of the rules

21:32.677 --> 21:34.111
her mother and I set in place.

21:34.112 --> 21:37.180
Think about leaving the door open.

21:37.181 --> 21:39.699
Or think about not coming back.

21:40.451 --> 21:41.826
House rules.

21:42.453 --> 21:43.869
Yes, sir.

21:55.934 --> 21:58.001
And I know you know better.

21:58.002 --> 21:59.871
- You...
- I what?

22:02.740 --> 22:05.576
All right then.

22:12.750 --> 22:14.217
Pretty good, right?

22:14.218 --> 22:16.153
You really like it with me singing?

22:16.154 --> 22:17.903
I do.

22:18.779 --> 22:20.656
We make a great team.

22:21.259 --> 22:22.259
You want to get dinner?

22:33.738 --> 22:36.640
I told Basie, should he find
the name of my church

22:36.641 --> 22:38.575
passing his lips ever again,

22:38.576 --> 22:41.578
it had better be
in the context of praise.

22:41.579 --> 22:43.013
Otherwise, the Lord's judgment

22:43.014 --> 22:44.514
of his deliberate twisting of scripture

22:44.515 --> 22:46.583
won't be the only thing
he's got to worry about.

22:46.584 --> 22:48.585
You did not.

22:48.586 --> 22:50.053
And that wasn't half
of what I had in mind

22:50.054 --> 22:51.154
to say either.

22:51.155 --> 22:53.623
Well, I'm glad somebody
called him out on it.

22:53.624 --> 22:55.058
My girlfriend sent over

22:55.059 --> 22:56.660
the, YouTube link of that sermon.

22:56.661 --> 22:59.329
And I tell you, he went there and back.

22:59.330 --> 23:01.298
I didn't see it, but I heard about it.

23:02.867 --> 23:05.159
That just reinforces my decision.

23:05.770 --> 23:06.994
About what?

23:07.305 --> 23:08.954
What I came here to tell you.

23:09.207 --> 23:10.706
What was that?

23:11.142 --> 23:14.745
I've decided to make Calvary
my new church home.

23:14.746 --> 23:16.079
Well, jalapeño.

23:18.683 --> 23:19.750
You're too much.

23:19.751 --> 23:22.119
Stop. You are too much.

23:24.155 --> 23:26.457
It's a good day.

23:28.453 --> 23:29.993
Gigi. Hey.

23:29.994 --> 23:31.161
What's all this stuff?

23:31.162 --> 23:35.332
Outreach files
Kevin left behind.

23:35.333 --> 23:38.567
Sorry.

23:39.170 --> 23:40.737
Hey, not your fault.

23:40.738 --> 23:41.779
Yeah.

23:44.075 --> 23:45.491
Well, what's up?

23:46.611 --> 23:48.578
What time is your date tonight?

23:48.579 --> 23:50.079
Why?

23:50.481 --> 23:52.282
Just tell me when it is.

23:52.283 --> 23:54.851
It's at 6:30. What's going on?

23:54.852 --> 23:57.421
Jabari asked me to dinner,
and mom and dad can't sit

23:57.422 --> 23:59.156
because they're going to Jacob's,

23:59.157 --> 24:02.426
and Maricel is busy,
and you're busy, too, so...

24:02.427 --> 24:04.593
Hey, we'll watch Nathan.

24:05.530 --> 24:07.898
No. No, I don't want to impose.

24:07.899 --> 24:10.000
The official slogan for imposing.

24:10.001 --> 24:12.135
You know what? Bye, Gigi.

24:12.136 --> 24:13.303
Come on, Charity.

24:13.304 --> 24:14.805
Seriously. I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.

24:14.806 --> 24:16.773
Listen, the only table
I could get for two

24:16.774 --> 24:21.111
was too early for us anyway,
so, yeah, we'll watch him.

24:21.112 --> 24:22.903
Are you sure?

24:23.648 --> 24:25.649
Time with my nephew?

24:25.650 --> 24:26.850
Baby sister, come on.

24:26.851 --> 24:28.452
Yes. Absolutely.

24:28.453 --> 24:31.021
Thank you.

24:31.022 --> 24:32.989
Yeah. Anytime.

24:32.990 --> 24:34.217
Go get him.

24:34.264 --> 24:35.791
All right.

24:39.430 --> 24:41.131
So, how many jobs did you have?

24:41.132 --> 24:42.673
I had two jobs.

24:43.367 --> 24:44.768
I priest on Sunday mornings,

24:44.769 --> 24:47.303
taught Bible study on Wednesday nights.

24:48.039 --> 24:52.776
Inbetween, I sold bibles
doortodoor for southwestern,

24:52.777 --> 24:56.780
and I worked parttime
for Memphis Memorial.

24:56.781 --> 24:57.781
Doing what?

24:57.782 --> 24:59.182
Maintenance and groundskeeping.

24:59.183 --> 25:02.219
Yes. And see?
And reaching the whole time.

25:02.220 --> 25:04.121
I don't remember any of that.

25:04.122 --> 25:06.123
Well, you were a little boy.

25:06.124 --> 25:07.557
But, I tell you what,

25:07.558 --> 25:10.026
he looked very much
like you look right now.

25:10.027 --> 25:12.629
- Aw.
- Kerissa, I have to tell you.

25:12.630 --> 25:16.700
You have done a lovely, lovely
job putting this place together.

25:16.701 --> 25:19.703
I have to say. I mean, it feels homey.

25:19.704 --> 25:21.638
Well, we're just lucky
that the lights are on

25:21.639 --> 25:23.206
so you can actually see it.

25:23.207 --> 25:25.475
I ran into your old boss today.

25:25.476 --> 25:26.943
- Basie.
- Yes.

25:26.944 --> 25:28.678
I paid a visit over at Triumph.

25:28.679 --> 25:30.313
About that sermon of his?

25:30.314 --> 25:31.249
You saw it?

25:31.250 --> 25:32.682
It's been making the rounds.

25:32.683 --> 25:34.918
I don't know he thinks
he's preaching to.

25:34.919 --> 25:37.621
I think the man is hellbent
on losing that church, too.

25:37.622 --> 25:39.856
When I visited Basie's office today,

25:39.857 --> 25:42.092
I crossed paths with a man...

25:42.093 --> 25:45.195
Tall, roughhewn, bearded,

25:45.196 --> 25:48.864
the kind of man that would
hang around a pool hall.

25:49.133 --> 25:50.634
Doesn't sound like an armor bearer.

25:50.635 --> 25:52.284
- Mnhmnh.
- Didn't look like one either.

25:52.970 --> 25:55.739
Is he doing prison ministry nowadays?

25:55.740 --> 25:56.707
No.

25:56.708 --> 25:58.540
What happened between you two?

25:58.976 --> 26:02.212
Everything seemed so hunky dory.

26:02.213 --> 26:05.515
When Basie and I parted ways,
we got the land and this house.

26:05.516 --> 26:08.051
Yes, complete with demonic curse.

26:08.052 --> 26:12.689
And Basie got his privacy.
I got to keep my word.

26:12.690 --> 26:17.093
With the nebuchadnezzar?
This is family, son.

26:17.094 --> 26:18.628
And what went down between Basie and I

26:18.629 --> 26:20.813
had nothing to do with pop or Calvary.

26:21.732 --> 26:25.669
First John, 2 and 5,
"whoever keeps his word,

26:25.670 --> 26:29.321
in him truly the love
of God is protected."

26:30.441 --> 26:32.741
Well, you can't argue with that.

26:40.618 --> 26:41.586
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:41.587 --> 26:42.835
You ready?

26:43.754 --> 26:45.188
Yeah.

26:45.189 --> 26:47.691
What? What's that face about?

26:47.692 --> 26:50.260
I was going to call you, but you
were already on your way here.

26:50.261 --> 26:52.362
All right. Well, talk to me.
What's the deal?

26:52.363 --> 26:53.597
Got a later table?

26:53.598 --> 26:54.847
Tell me we did.

26:55.266 --> 26:57.267
No. My sister needs a sitter.

26:57.268 --> 26:58.602
Charity and the baby?

26:58.603 --> 26:59.852
Yeah.

27:00.871 --> 27:02.172
He'll be down by 7:00.

27:02.173 --> 27:05.009
We can pick up some food
on the way, maybe cook?

27:07.111 --> 27:09.412
I am so sorry, but she never asks,

27:09.413 --> 27:11.414
and I'm trying to prove that I care.

27:11.415 --> 27:13.283
That didn't sound right,
but you know what I mean.

27:13.284 --> 27:15.051
I think I know what you mean.

27:15.052 --> 27:16.253
Is it okay?

27:16.254 --> 27:17.911
Of course.

27:19.023 --> 27:21.291
I knew you wouldn't mind.

27:21.292 --> 27:25.196
I knew it because you're the best.

27:27.346 --> 27:29.915
So this dinner,
is it like a dinner or a class?

27:29.916 --> 27:31.583
I don't get it.

27:31.584 --> 27:33.302
Yeah.

27:34.153 --> 27:35.954
Yeah, which part?

27:36.430 --> 27:39.257
It's all that, both.

27:39.258 --> 27:42.294
Dinner with the girls, get
served with a fivecourse meal,

27:42.295 --> 27:44.863
they tell you which fork to use,

27:44.864 --> 27:49.034
and how to conduct yourself
like a good Christian lady.

27:49.035 --> 27:53.572
Gotcha.

27:54.703 --> 27:56.854
They're probably going to make you

27:56.855 --> 27:58.744
turn your phone off?

27:59.525 --> 28:02.994
You know, 'cause of, like,
manners and stuff.

28:02.995 --> 28:05.229
If I didn't have manners,
I wouldn't be texting.

28:05.230 --> 28:07.565
My dad was so harsh to him earlier.

28:07.566 --> 28:09.634
This right here is damage control.

28:15.574 --> 28:19.143
Fine. Fini. Finito.

28:19.144 --> 28:20.678
Done.

28:20.679 --> 28:24.615
I'm ready to be sophisticated.

28:32.986 --> 28:35.459
Go ahead. Answer it.

28:35.460 --> 28:37.574
- But that's it.
- Thank you.

28:38.697 --> 28:40.531
- Should I pull up here?
- No, then they'll try

28:40.532 --> 28:42.300
to park your car.
You don't want to do that.

28:42.301 --> 28:43.868
- It's no trouble.
- No, just pull over

28:43.869 --> 28:45.636
right here instead.

28:45.637 --> 28:47.506
Okay. Great.

28:55.047 --> 28:59.116
Um, I had a really nice time tonight.

28:59.117 --> 29:00.806
Yeah, me too.

29:01.854 --> 29:04.288
You were really nice to that guy.

29:04.289 --> 29:06.057
Not at all.

29:06.058 --> 29:08.025
There was a time
when I was that kid, right?

29:08.026 --> 29:10.895
Always had a demo in my pocket
ready to hand out.

29:12.297 --> 29:13.731
I don't know. Maybe it's good.

29:13.732 --> 29:15.800
Wait, so you'll actually listen to it?

29:15.801 --> 29:17.268
Yeah, sure.

29:17.614 --> 29:19.575
You have to. It's only right.

29:20.639 --> 29:21.906
Right.

29:21.907 --> 29:24.976
Um, okay, then.

29:24.977 --> 29:27.124
See you in Nashville?

29:27.746 --> 29:29.376
Yeah.

29:39.458 --> 29:41.388
Wow.

29:43.932 --> 29:45.096
Is he down?

29:45.097 --> 29:46.764
Yeah. He just needed a new diaper.

29:46.765 --> 29:49.600
He barely even moved when I changed him.

29:49.601 --> 29:51.502
So you remember how
to do all of that?

29:51.503 --> 29:54.705
Like riding a bike. Come on.

29:56.308 --> 29:57.775
This is very cute.

29:59.011 --> 30:00.949
- Geez.
- Yeah.

30:01.680 --> 30:04.682
Gosh, thank you for rolling
with the punches on this.

30:04.683 --> 30:07.051
- I owe you one.
- Not at all.

30:07.052 --> 30:11.122
It's kind of nice to see
how the other half lives.

30:11.123 --> 30:12.757
I think I'm the other half
of the other half.

30:12.758 --> 30:14.755
Yeah, this is it.

30:16.929 --> 30:18.926
You ever invite guys over?

30:19.831 --> 30:22.596
I just mean, it must be strange.

30:23.402 --> 30:25.307
I don't know. Is it?

30:27.339 --> 30:28.673
I just mean when

30:28.674 --> 30:29.954
your parents are here all night.

30:33.946 --> 30:36.147
Can I ask you a question?

30:36.568 --> 30:37.782
Shoot.

30:37.783 --> 30:39.016
Did you interview Carlton

30:39.017 --> 30:41.531
for that piece you had
in the paper today?

30:42.321 --> 30:43.825
Yeah.

30:45.057 --> 30:46.490
And you didn't tell me?

30:46.491 --> 30:48.359
I thought we had that agreement,

30:48.789 --> 30:52.668
not to mix this and the other?

30:53.799 --> 30:56.634
- Was that wrong?
- No. No.

30:56.635 --> 30:58.169
It's just, I'm trying to figure out

30:58.170 --> 31:01.405
why you didn't ask my dad
for a comment on the story.

31:01.406 --> 31:04.008
Yeah, I thought, "don't."

31:04.009 --> 31:07.179
Got it. Got it.

31:11.917 --> 31:14.418
You know, the whole Chinese
wall thing was your idea.

31:14.419 --> 31:16.120
If you want to reevaluate it, we can.

31:16.121 --> 31:19.190
No. Look, no. I just...

31:19.191 --> 31:26.831
You know, maybe we shouldn't do this.

31:26.832 --> 31:27.865
Do what?

31:27.866 --> 31:29.735
This. Us.

31:32.104 --> 31:34.042
Why would you say that?

31:34.740 --> 31:38.839
Because it's, like, look at us.

31:39.878 --> 31:41.679
I know there's been
extenuating circumstances,

31:41.680 --> 31:43.447
but every time we get close to being

31:43.448 --> 31:46.650
more than study partners,
you find a reason to pull away.

31:46.651 --> 31:49.020
- I'm not pulling away.
- No?

31:49.021 --> 31:53.157
I mean, you traded a romantic
dinner for two for babysitting.

31:53.158 --> 31:54.825
And then you picked a fight with me.

31:54.826 --> 31:56.773
I didn't realize we were fighting.

31:57.524 --> 31:59.096
You're right.

31:59.097 --> 32:00.569
We're not.

32:02.601 --> 32:04.235
You know, you pull back too, d.

32:04.236 --> 32:06.170
You do. You have your ways.

32:06.171 --> 32:08.439
- When have I pulled back?
- Let me see.

32:10.308 --> 32:12.676
I, um... I had this job...

32:12.677 --> 32:15.479
this woman in New York

32:15.480 --> 32:17.915
who really wants me to come.
I didn't need to know that.

32:17.916 --> 32:19.550
Okay. I told you that to include you.

32:19.551 --> 32:21.052
And then there's this
whole mysterious reason

32:21.053 --> 32:22.520
why you don't go to church,

32:22.521 --> 32:24.155
that you still haven't
told me about that,

32:24.156 --> 32:26.011
and I'm a pastor.

32:26.845 --> 32:28.638
I think I'm gonna go.

32:30.762 --> 32:33.852
- Come on.
- Yeah, no. I am.

32:34.499 --> 32:35.533
I'm gonna go.

32:43.041 --> 32:44.842
I don't know what it is about you.

32:44.843 --> 32:48.450
I've never gotten so little
from someone and stuck around.

32:49.181 --> 32:54.552
And you don't even seem to know
you do it, so it's my fault.

33:12.039 --> 33:13.473
Hey.

33:13.474 --> 33:15.175
- Hey.
- How's my baby?

33:15.176 --> 33:16.176
Out like a light.

33:16.177 --> 33:17.811
Ooh.

33:17.812 --> 33:19.314
Where's Darius?

33:20.882 --> 33:21.882
Mnhmnh.

33:23.818 --> 33:25.952
My night wasn't so hot either.

33:25.953 --> 33:27.621
What happened?

33:27.622 --> 33:29.623
He pecked me on the cheek.

33:31.492 --> 33:33.493
Don't laugh.

33:33.494 --> 33:34.828
You here, too.

33:34.829 --> 33:36.630
Like, I don't know what's wrong with me.

33:36.631 --> 33:37.931
Is there something wrong with me?

33:37.932 --> 33:41.628
Or do I just attract a certain type?

33:42.236 --> 33:44.214
I don't think he's gay.

33:44.839 --> 33:46.139
I don't know what he is.

33:46.140 --> 33:47.340
Is that yours?

33:47.341 --> 33:48.942
Yes.

33:48.943 --> 33:51.745
- Get you some.
- Ooh.

33:51.746 --> 33:53.413
Because, let me tell you something,

33:53.414 --> 33:54.881
I played it too cool at dinner.

33:54.882 --> 33:57.284
I'm starving.

33:57.285 --> 33:59.619
And you still didn't get any.

33:59.620 --> 34:00.821
You know what, you ain't either,

34:00.822 --> 34:03.108
so what are you talking about?

34:03.558 --> 34:04.791
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

34:04.792 --> 34:06.793
Hey, sorry we can't, you know,

34:06.794 --> 34:08.328
give you a better explanation.

34:08.329 --> 34:10.964
No. We understand discretion.

34:10.965 --> 34:13.076
And backed up by scripture.

34:13.568 --> 34:14.868
You know, that guy was probably just

34:14.869 --> 34:16.303
a member of the church
asking for rent money.

34:16.304 --> 34:17.437
There's no shortage of that over there.

34:17.438 --> 34:19.166
I tell you what.

34:19.706 --> 34:23.543
I retract the request, and it
was good to see both of you.

34:23.543 --> 34:27.090
Yes. And thank you so much for dinner.

34:28.049 --> 34:30.382
- Bishop, before you go.
- Yes, dear?

34:30.384 --> 34:32.619
Listen, do you have the car key?

34:32.620 --> 34:33.719
- Um...
- We still having trouble

34:33.721 --> 34:34.955
with that breaker box...

34:34.956 --> 34:36.933
Whoa! No.

34:38.025 --> 34:39.726
Let her finish her sentence.

34:39.726 --> 34:40.896
No!

34:41.395 --> 34:44.697
Sorry, mama, but we
discussed this earlier.

34:44.699 --> 34:46.234
Kerissa, don't do that.

34:46.934 --> 34:49.703
That's, um, my cue.

34:49.704 --> 34:51.605
- Good night.
- Good night, darling.

34:51.606 --> 34:55.577
And, son, just.

34:58.212 --> 35:01.114
- Son, take it easy.
- All right. Speak soon.

35:01.115 --> 35:04.794
- Good night.
- All right. Be careful.

35:05.319 --> 35:07.881
Let us know when you're home.

35:09.257 --> 35:10.924
What was that?

35:10.925 --> 35:12.425
A woman's attempt to care for the home

35:12.426 --> 35:14.513
she raises her children in.

35:15.997 --> 35:18.198
I asked you not to do that.

35:18.199 --> 35:20.433
I don't care about your pride, Jacob.

35:20.434 --> 35:23.003
- It's not pride.
- Then what is it?

35:23.004 --> 35:24.404
I told you to look for a job.

35:24.405 --> 35:27.274
Did you look for one today?
Did you even go online and look?

35:27.275 --> 35:28.568
No.

35:29.143 --> 35:30.077
How you know what I did?

35:30.078 --> 35:31.311
Am I wrong?

35:31.312 --> 35:33.113
I have a job.

35:33.114 --> 35:34.447
You have a hobby.

35:34.448 --> 35:36.549
You heard Bishop.

35:36.550 --> 35:39.386
When you work to pay the bills,
it keeps the preaching pure,

35:39.387 --> 35:41.922
which is what you say you want anyway.

35:41.923 --> 35:43.290
It is what I want.

35:43.291 --> 35:45.292
Then get a job.

35:45.293 --> 35:47.594
Or go down to the river and dredge up

35:47.595 --> 35:49.062
some civil war pirate ship

35:49.063 --> 35:50.797
like I heard about on the radio.

35:50.798 --> 35:52.899
Something! Anything!

35:52.900 --> 35:55.001
But to have your kids and your wife

35:55.002 --> 35:57.003
stumbling around in the dark at night

35:57.004 --> 35:58.772
because the lights don't work?

35:58.773 --> 35:59.906
Kerissa.

35:59.907 --> 36:01.207
I don't want to hear it anymore, Jacob.

36:01.208 --> 36:03.743
Okay. But you're going to.

36:03.744 --> 36:06.479
For all the years I was creeping,

36:06.480 --> 36:08.114
you treated me this way.

36:08.115 --> 36:10.483
And I just continued to take it
because I was out of line.

36:10.484 --> 36:12.529
But things are different now.

36:13.154 --> 36:15.155
And you cannot continue to do that.

36:15.156 --> 36:17.325
I'm not going to stand for it.

36:18.592 --> 36:22.295
I have the moral authority
that you wanted me to have,

36:22.296 --> 36:24.197
that you prayed for me to have.

36:24.198 --> 36:25.959
So respect it.

36:26.334 --> 36:30.005
The Lord will provide in his own time.

36:30.471 --> 36:34.134
So just wait. Just trust.

36:34.642 --> 36:38.430
Trust me, trust him, and wait.

36:38.846 --> 36:42.449
And maybe try paying some of
this attention to your daughter.

36:42.450 --> 36:43.935
She needs it.

36:44.785 --> 36:46.855
I'm getting ready for bed.

36:54.562 --> 36:57.364
- What?
- Hey, um...

36:57.365 --> 36:58.999
I've been calling you.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.300
Yeah, now.

37:00.301 --> 37:02.502
I text you a bunch earlier,
and you didn't answer.

37:02.503 --> 37:05.665
I couldn't. They took our phones.

37:06.240 --> 37:07.751
I'm sorry.

37:08.776 --> 37:10.086
Me too.

37:10.978 --> 37:12.380
I miss you.

37:14.715 --> 37:16.217
How was rehearsal?

37:17.184 --> 37:19.619
It's whatever. You had to be there.

37:40.741 --> 37:42.160
Hey, you.

37:42.476 --> 37:44.144
You still up?

37:44.145 --> 37:45.645
Yeah.

37:45.646 --> 37:46.873
Got a minute?

37:47.615 --> 37:49.249
Yeah.

37:49.250 --> 37:51.044
I'm out front.

37:56.223 --> 37:57.884
Hey.

37:59.894 --> 38:01.061
Hey.

38:01.062 --> 38:03.181
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

38:04.532 --> 38:07.634
So, here's the story.

38:07.635 --> 38:08.853
What story?

38:09.236 --> 38:11.481
Why I don't go to church anymore.

38:12.039 --> 38:13.730
You wanted to know. I'll tell you.

38:13.731 --> 38:15.842
You don't have to tell me anything.

38:15.843 --> 38:17.529
I used to be married.

38:20.047 --> 38:21.658
Why didn't you tell me?

38:23.684 --> 38:25.412
Because she's dead.

38:26.353 --> 38:28.790
My God.

38:30.157 --> 38:31.891
Yeah, we were on our way to a matinée

38:31.892 --> 38:33.792
one Sunday afternoon, and

38:35.839 --> 38:38.223
we got tboned in an intersection.

38:40.734 --> 38:42.721
I am so sorry.

38:44.071 --> 38:46.739
I asked the Pastor after the funeral

38:46.740 --> 38:48.741
if he could help me understand.

38:48.742 --> 38:53.814
He said, "it's best
we don't question God."

38:57.017 --> 39:00.029
So I haven't been back to church since.

39:03.991 --> 39:05.926
Other than as a reporter.

39:09.597 --> 39:12.133
Thank you for telling me that.

39:15.669 --> 39:20.240
You were right. I was holding
back, and that was why.

39:33.730 --> 39:35.732
Am I gonna see you again?

39:37.625 --> 39:39.277
You tell me.

39:46.767 --> 39:49.269
God, I hope so.

39:57.044 --> 39:58.880
Then yeah.

40:05.085 --> 40:09.866
So Basie lost the church's
money, not his own.

40:10.057 --> 40:13.993
- That's right.
- And you two paid it back?

40:13.994 --> 40:17.363
Yes, with our savings.

40:17.364 --> 40:22.468
We got the land and the house,
but we should've gotten Triumph.

40:22.469 --> 40:25.071
Well, that certainly would beat
that twoacre soup kitchen

40:25.072 --> 40:26.806
- you've got now.
- Amen.

40:26.807 --> 40:28.541
And Basie still owes these people

40:28.542 --> 40:30.443
over a quarter of a million dollars,

40:30.444 --> 40:31.878
even after all we did.

40:31.879 --> 40:33.373
Can you prove it?

40:34.348 --> 40:36.709
I know someone who can.

40:37.751 --> 40:40.553
Of course, you can never
tell Jacob I told you.

40:40.554 --> 40:42.222
Understood.

40:42.223 --> 40:43.690
He'd never forgive me.

40:43.691 --> 40:45.760
Don't you worry, dear.
