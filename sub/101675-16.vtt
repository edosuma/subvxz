Anything else you'd like to add?

00:11.929 --> 00:14.431
I read this magazine.

00:14.431 --> 00:16.099
Why won't you compete with me?

00:16.099 --> 00:18.685
Because it's fun
watching you get upset.

00:18.685 --> 00:19.853
What's fun about it?

00:19.853 --> 00:21.480
Everything.

00:25.317 --> 00:27.903

Come on, George. One more.

Feel the burn, big boy.

00:46.964 --> 00:49.091
Feel the burn.

00:49.091 --> 00:52.886
But when it came to academics,
the spotlight was all mine.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.097
Sheldon, having you here
has been a real boon

00:55.097 --> 00:56.849
to this university.

00:58.141 --> 01:00.269
ADULT SHELDON:I did love basking in its glow.

01:00.269 --> 01:02.312
So we could
really use your help

01:02.312 --> 01:04.815
in raising the school's
profile even higher.

01:04.815 --> 01:08.068
Of course.
My intellect is at your service.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.278
Excellent.

01:09.278 --> 01:11.154
There is another
young physics prodigy

01:11.154 --> 01:13.156
we want you to help us recruit.

01:13.156 --> 01:14.700

Why would you want
Paige to come here?

01:37.181 --> 01:38.098
You know her?

01:38.098 --> 01:39.683
Oh, I know her.

01:39.683 --> 01:40.851
Ah. Wonderful.

01:40.851 --> 01:42.102
Just tell her how much
you love the school

01:42.102 --> 01:43.979
and convince her to enroll.

01:43.979 --> 01:45.439
But you don't need
another child prodigy.

01:45.439 --> 01:46.899
You've already got me.

01:46.899 --> 01:49.276
And you have been... (scoffs)
so great.

01:49.276 --> 01:51.778
Just imagine what it'd be like
having two of you.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.614
Well, why would you want
two of me?

01:53.614 --> 01:56.033
I mean, I've heard even
one of me is a lot to handle.

01:56.033 --> 01:59.119
Well, you're not afraid of
a little competition, are you?

01:59.119 --> 02:00.579
From Paige? Hardly.

02:00.579 --> 02:03.040
But I should warn you,
she can be very difficult.

02:03.040 --> 02:07.085
Well, luckily I've had some
practice with that lately.

02:07.085 --> 02:08.086
And how do you handle it?

02:09.338 --> 02:13.133
Usually I, uh,
play to their egos.

02:13.133 --> 02:16.220
You know, make them feel like
the smartest person in the room.

02:16.220 --> 02:18.222
And they fall for that?

02:18.222 --> 02:19.556
Well... (chuckles)

02:19.556 --> 02:21.892
not everyone's as smart as you,
Sheldon.

02:23.185 --> 02:26.522
Okay, have a great day.
Love you.

02:27.314 --> 02:28.315
Love you, too.

02:28.315 --> 02:30.067
What are you doing?

02:30.067 --> 02:31.818
I learned it in baseball.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.904
When you don't want the other
team to see what you're saying.

02:33.904 --> 02:36.323
It's okay to love your mom.

02:36.323 --> 02:38.534
At home. Here, you get the hand.

02:40.369 --> 02:41.787
BRENDA:
Hey, Mary.

02:41.787 --> 02:43.789
Oh, Brenda.

02:43.789 --> 02:45.165
Love the haircut.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.250
Thank you.

02:46.250 --> 02:48.001
I was always afraid to go short,

02:48.001 --> 02:50.003
but I figured I already lost
a husband.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.672
What's a few inches off the top?

02:51.672 --> 02:54.091
Well, you look like
a new person.

02:54.091 --> 02:55.425
I feel like a new person.

02:55.425 --> 02:56.844
I just needed to do

02:56.844 --> 02:58.262
something for me.

02:58.262 --> 03:01.181
It was either this
or get a tattoo on my thigh.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.267
I think you made
the right choice.

03:03.267 --> 03:04.852
Well, I guess.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.770
I mean, who's seeing me naked
these days?

03:07.813 --> 03:09.481
Well, I wouldn't know.

03:11.275 --> 03:13.277
(dryer whirring)

03:13.277 --> 03:14.945
(door bells jingle)

03:16.738 --> 03:18.949
Hey, Mary.
What are you doing here?

03:18.949 --> 03:21.285
I don't know.
I was just out running errands

03:21.285 --> 03:23.203
and thought maybe
I'd make an appointment.

03:23.203 --> 03:26.373
Well, chair's free now.
Come on, have a seat.

03:26.373 --> 03:29.168
Oh, um, o-okay.
(chuckles)

03:29.168 --> 03:32.129
Okay. What can I do for you?

03:32.129 --> 03:35.174
Well, I guess I'm just
looking for a change.

03:35.174 --> 03:36.216
Uh-oh.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.093
What's "uh-oh"?

03:38.093 --> 03:40.304
Well, nothing, it's just,
when the women come in

03:40.304 --> 03:43.223
looking for a change, it's
usually relationship trouble.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.975
(laughs softly):
Oh...

03:44.975 --> 03:48.145
Well, not me. I'm fine.

03:48.145 --> 03:50.689
Okay, but I got a perm
and a divorce in the same week

03:50.689 --> 03:52.983
and I only regret one of them.

03:52.983 --> 03:54.318
(laughs)

03:54.318 --> 03:56.028
Maybe this is a bad idea.
I should come back.

03:56.028 --> 03:57.738
No, no, no, no.
Come on, you're already here.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.990
Either way,
there's nothing wrong

03:59.990 --> 04:01.325
in a little change.

04:01.325 --> 04:02.743
Okay. Uh...

04:02.743 --> 04:04.661
What do you think I should do?

04:04.661 --> 04:07.164
Well, when you look
at yourself in the mirror,

04:07.164 --> 04:08.248
who do you see?

04:08.248 --> 04:13.420
I see a mom and... a wife.

04:13.420 --> 04:16.131
Okay, that's the hair
you already got.

04:16.131 --> 04:18.258
Who do you want to see?

04:18.258 --> 04:20.385
Oh, um...

04:22.638 --> 04:24.473
Maybe we start with the nails.

04:24.473 --> 04:26.433
That's a great idea.
Yeah.

04:26.433 --> 04:29.770
So now I'm supposed to talk
Paige into coming to my school.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.063
Maybe it'll be nice
to have somebody

04:31.063 --> 04:32.689
your own age to hang out with.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.441
Sure, so the next time
someone says,

04:34.441 --> 04:36.360
"Hey, look what the kid
genius did," people will say,

04:36.360 --> 04:37.736
"Which one? There's so many."

04:37.736 --> 04:40.697
I thought you and that
little girl were friends.

04:40.697 --> 04:42.950
Missy's her friend.
I'm her rival.

04:42.950 --> 04:45.285
Well, I think you're getting
worked up about nothing.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.704
Maybe she won't even decide
to come to this school.

04:48.497 --> 04:51.625
Oh, I see where you're going.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.669
I should convince her
it's a terrible school.

04:53.669 --> 04:54.628
That's brilliant.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.630
That's not where I was going.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.382
Too late, I'm already there.

05:03.679 --> 05:05.055
What are you doing?

05:05.973 --> 05:08.559
Look at me
and tell me what you see.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.645
What?

05:11.645 --> 05:13.647
Did you get a haircut?
Looks great.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.315
No, I didn't get a haircut.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.442
'Cause you don't need one.
Looking good, babe.

05:17.442 --> 05:18.694
Lord.

05:18.694 --> 05:22.447
Just tell me what you see
when you look at me.

05:22.447 --> 05:24.658
(sighs, mutters)

05:24.658 --> 05:26.869
I don't know what's going on,
but this feels like a trap.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.830
I went to the salon
to get a haircut.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.957
Knew it, looking foxy.

05:31.957 --> 05:35.294
But I didn't get one because
I don't know what I want.

05:35.294 --> 05:37.254
(quietly):
Oh.

05:37.254 --> 05:40.507
You know who's got good hair?
Charlene Tilton.

05:40.507 --> 05:41.717
Who?

05:41.717 --> 05:43.218
That little blonde one
on Dallas.

05:43.218 --> 05:44.970
People make a fuss
over Victoria Principal,

05:44.970 --> 05:46.305
but Charlene Tilton...

05:46.305 --> 05:47.681
You're not helping me, George.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.810
I knew this was a trap.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.272
I must tell you
that Sheldon was very excited

05:55.272 --> 05:57.900
to hear that you might
be joining us.

05:57.900 --> 05:59.526
Well, isn't he sweet?

05:59.526 --> 06:00.903
He's a peach.

06:00.903 --> 06:03.155
All right, I'm here.
Hello, hello.

06:03.155 --> 06:04.323
Hello.

06:04.323 --> 06:06.533
Hi, Sheldon.
I'm so excited for you

06:06.533 --> 06:08.118
to show me around campus today.

06:08.118 --> 06:09.661
The only reason
I'm doing it is because...

06:09.661 --> 06:11.830
He's excited to do it,
I'm excited he's doing it.

06:11.830 --> 06:13.665
Are you excited?
Sure.

06:13.665 --> 06:15.334
Everyone's excited. Yay.

06:16.460 --> 06:18.337
(sighs)
Come on, let's go.

06:18.337 --> 06:21.423
You and me, together again.

06:21.423 --> 06:22.633
It just feels right, doesn't it?

06:22.633 --> 06:24.092
(grumbles)

06:24.843 --> 06:26.678
There's the cafeteria.

with hair in it.

06:28.805 --> 06:31.183
Over there is the quad.
It's a nice place to relax,

06:31.183 --> 06:33.393
if you like getting hit in
the head with Frisbees.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.646
I know what you're doing.
No, you don't.

06:35.646 --> 06:37.022
You have nothing
to worry about.

06:37.022 --> 06:38.774
I don't want to come
to this school.

06:38.774 --> 06:40.692
I'm just looking at it
to make my mom happy

06:40.692 --> 06:41.652
since it's close to home.

06:41.652 --> 06:43.820
Well, that's wonderful news.

06:43.820 --> 06:46.281
Besides, I've got offers
from way better universities.

06:46.281 --> 06:48.992
What do you mean?
What's wrong with this school?

06:48.992 --> 06:50.911
It's fine.
It's just nowhere near as good

06:50.911 --> 06:52.704
as Harvard or Columbia.

06:52.704 --> 06:54.373
It is too.

06:54.373 --> 06:56.750
If you like a substandard
science department

06:56.750 --> 06:58.627
and hair in your tuna.

I was settling

close to my mommy.

Well, the important thing
is you're here and you're happy.

I thought I was,
but why does Paige

08:06.653 --> 08:08.655
get to go to a better school
than me?

08:09.656 --> 08:11.658
Hey, I know
what'll solve your problem.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.452
Convince Paige to come here.

08:13.452 --> 08:15.120
Yeah. Wait.

08:15.120 --> 08:18.874
Sometimes I think George
doesn't even see me.

my boys think all I'm good for
is food and clean clothes.

You start feeling
like a ghost, right?

08:27.090 --> 08:28.050
Yes.

08:28.050 --> 08:29.384
I get it, I'm a mom.

08:29.384 --> 08:32.679
(sighs) So did that feeling
ever go away?

08:32.679 --> 08:33.764
Yeah.

08:33.764 --> 08:37.142
I realized I was doing
everything for everyone else,

08:37.142 --> 08:39.436
and I didn't have
anything left for me.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.897
So, here we are.

08:42.898 --> 08:46.485

to love making my own clothes.

Mm-hmm.
I always
thought I'd do

08:48.111 --> 08:49.363
something with that.

08:49.363 --> 08:51.365
Maybe I should get back to it.

08:51.365 --> 08:52.741
You definitely should.

08:52.741 --> 08:54.451
Okay.

08:54.451 --> 08:56.954
Okay. So, what are we thinking?

08:56.954 --> 09:01.333
Actually, I don't think
I need a haircut anymore.

09:01.333 --> 09:03.418
Thank you so much.

09:03.418 --> 09:05.254
Oh, my pleasure.

What are you doing?

09:17.307 --> 09:18.809
I'm sewing.

09:18.809 --> 09:19.977
Why?

09:19.977 --> 09:21.979
Because it's a thing
I like to do.

09:21.979 --> 09:24.064
I ain't never seen you sew.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.149
Well, you're seeing it now.

09:26.149 --> 09:27.818
What you making?

09:27.818 --> 09:29.611
A dress for Missy.

09:30.654 --> 09:32.531
Did you lose your job?

09:32.531 --> 09:33.657
No.

09:33.657 --> 09:35.158
Did Dad lose his job?

09:35.158 --> 09:38.704
It's about me doing
something for myself.

09:38.704 --> 09:40.539
All right, don't get sassy.

09:40.539 --> 09:41.540
GEORGE SR.:
Hey.

09:43.333 --> 09:44.668
What's going on in here?

09:44.668 --> 09:46.753
She's making clothes
for Missy.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.839
Uh-oh. Did you lose your job?

09:48.839 --> 09:49.756
No.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.884
She's doing something for her.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.887
(whispers):
I don't get it, either.

09:56.638 --> 09:57.764
SHELDON:Ooh, maybe I'll transfer

09:57.764 --> 09:59.683
to the University of Zurich.

09:59.683 --> 10:01.143
I thought you liked your school.

10:01.143 --> 10:03.604
I did, until Paige ruined it.

10:03.604 --> 10:05.063
Why do you care what she thinks?

10:05.063 --> 10:05.856
I don't.

10:05.856 --> 10:07.774
Sure sounds like you do.

10:07.774 --> 10:10.861
I can't help it.
She makes me crazy.

10:10.861 --> 10:12.362
Then stop thinking about her.

10:12.362 --> 10:13.572
I wish I could.

10:13.572 --> 10:15.991
Ooh, maybe you have
a crush on her.

10:16.783 --> 10:17.951
That's ridiculous.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.870
I don't know.

10:19.870 --> 10:20.913
I don't.

10:20.913 --> 10:24.124
You care what she thinks, you
can't stop talking about her.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.584
I don't have a crush on her!

10:25.584 --> 10:26.710
Are you sure?

10:26.710 --> 10:28.378
I don't know!

10:34.760 --> 10:36.595
Okay, here we go.

10:36.637 --> 10:40.098
"Is it a crush? Take this
juicy quiz and find out.

10:40.098 --> 10:42.643
Do you think about them
when they're not around?"

10:42.643 --> 10:44.019
Lately, yes.

10:44.019 --> 10:46.605
"Are you jealous when other
people give them attention?"

10:46.605 --> 10:48.232
I suppose I am.

10:48.232 --> 10:50.067
"Do you get nervous
when you're around them?"

10:50.067 --> 10:53.487
How could I not? Last time
she punched me, in the face.

10:53.487 --> 10:54.863
That was so great.

10:54.863 --> 10:56.657
"Do you talk about them
all the time?"

10:56.657 --> 10:58.617
That's a big fat yes.

10:58.617 --> 11:00.619
"Do you dream about them?"

11:00.619 --> 11:02.287
Oh, dear.

11:02.287 --> 11:04.081
Just last night I had
a nightmare that she solved

11:04.081 --> 11:06.500
the Einstein field equations
ahead of me.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.210
That's five out of five.

11:08.210 --> 11:10.754
"You're crushing harder
than Zack on Kelly Kapowski."

11:10.754 --> 11:13.465
Uh, what does that mean?

11:13.465 --> 11:15.676
Trust me, that's a big deal.

11:15.676 --> 11:18.554
ADULT SHELDON:My sister had gotten
into my head, but I needed

11:18.554 --> 11:21.682
a more reliable opinion
than a magazine that included

11:21.682 --> 11:24.351
the Hottest Tips for Pouty Lips.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.352
Georgie?

11:25.352 --> 11:26.812
What?

11:26.812 --> 11:29.106
Can I ask you a question
about girls?

11:29.106 --> 11:31.900
Go ahead, but I find them
very confusing.

11:31.900 --> 11:34.528
Missy thinks I have
a crush on Paige.

11:34.528 --> 11:35.863
Do you?

11:35.863 --> 11:38.907
I don't know,
but I know that I don't want to.

11:38.907 --> 11:41.702
Well, you don't get to choose.

11:41.702 --> 11:43.078
It's just something you feel.

11:43.078 --> 11:45.581
Did you have a crush
on your girlfriend?

11:45.581 --> 11:46.915
Yeah, I guess.

11:46.915 --> 11:48.709
How did you know when you did?

11:48.709 --> 11:51.628
Well, one day she came to school
in these soccer shorts,

11:51.628 --> 11:53.005
and that was it.

11:53.005 --> 11:55.382
What happened,
you played soccer with her?

11:55.382 --> 11:56.508
No, dummy.

11:56.508 --> 11:58.677
Then what was the
significance of the shorts?

11:59.720 --> 12:01.346
I don't think I can help you.

12:01.346 --> 12:02.598
Fine, I'll ask Dad.

12:02.598 --> 12:03.599
Good luck. The only thing

12:03.599 --> 12:05.309
he has a crush on is beer.

12:05.309 --> 12:07.186
ADULT SHELDON:I wasn't getting
the help I needed,

12:07.186 --> 12:10.689
so I turned
to the smartest resource I knew.

12:10.689 --> 12:13.108
Love is a funny thing.

12:13.108 --> 12:15.694
They say, "The heart wants
what the heart wants,"

12:15.694 --> 12:17.613
but I think it should be,

12:17.613 --> 12:21.700
"The limbic system wants
what the limbic system wants."

12:21.700 --> 12:24.494
Finally, someone's making sense.

12:24.494 --> 12:27.956
Well, not to brag, but when
it comes to unrequited love,

12:27.956 --> 12:30.125
I'm kind of an expert.

12:30.125 --> 12:33.003
Well, when I talk to Paige,
all she does is drive me crazy.

12:33.003 --> 12:37.132
There's a thin line between
affection and aggravation.

12:37.132 --> 12:39.593
The Roman poet Catullus said,

12:39.593 --> 12:44.223
"I hate and I love
and I know not why."

12:44.223 --> 12:46.308
I'm not sure
what to make of that.

12:46.308 --> 12:48.602
Perhaps it'd be
more useful in Latin.

12:48.602 --> 12:50.062
"Odi et amo..."

12:50.062 --> 12:52.564
I just want to know
if I have a crush.

12:52.564 --> 12:53.899
Well, does your
heart rate elevate

12:53.899 --> 12:55.567
when you're in her presence?

12:56.610 --> 12:57.694
I suppose.

12:57.694 --> 12:59.655
Does your stomach flutter?

12:59.655 --> 13:01.240
Yes.

13:01.240 --> 13:05.410
Sounds like your limbic system
might be doing its thing.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.412
Oh, dear.

13:09.623 --> 13:12.000
Hey.
Hey.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.836
That's a lot of fabric.

13:13.836 --> 13:15.462
Oh, it's not just fabric.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.965
I also got pattern books
and an accessory kit.

13:19.925 --> 13:21.927
Can I ask how much
that all cost?

13:21.927 --> 13:24.012
Well, it's hard to say,
because in the long run

13:24.012 --> 13:25.931
I'm gonna save us money.

13:25.931 --> 13:28.851
Well, what did it cost
in the short run?

13:28.851 --> 13:30.602
I don't know, a hundred dollars?

13:30.602 --> 13:34.690
A hundred dollars?
What is wrong with you?

13:34.690 --> 13:36.441
Why would you say that?

13:36.441 --> 13:37.860
That is a good question.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.736
I mean, what is wrong with you?

13:39.736 --> 13:41.738
Why is it okay when you say it?

13:41.738 --> 13:43.740
'Cause clearly there's
something wrong with you.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.951
So you think it's fine
that she spent

13:45.951 --> 13:48.245
a hundred dollars on thread?

13:48.245 --> 13:51.081
I think it's fine that she has
something that makes her happy.

13:52.916 --> 13:54.334
What are you looking for?

13:54.334 --> 13:55.586
Anybody but you.

13:56.378 --> 13:58.172
Look, I get it.

13:58.172 --> 14:01.383
One time, Darlene got all
into scrapbooking.

14:01.383 --> 14:04.469
Overnight, our den became
her scrapbooking room.

14:04.469 --> 14:06.054
What did you do?

14:06.054 --> 14:07.681
I said, "Whatever makes
you happy, dear,"

14:07.681 --> 14:09.850
and made love to her
in the scrapbooking room.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.018
Ha.

14:12.311 --> 14:13.979
(exhales)

14:13.979 --> 14:16.440
Maybe if you had three kids,
you'd worry more about money.

14:16.440 --> 14:18.734
Oh, we can't wait
to have babies.

14:18.734 --> 14:21.653
I just love the way
their little heads smell.

14:21.653 --> 14:25.157
Does anybody in here
want to be my friend?

14:25.157 --> 14:26.825
Anybody?

14:26.825 --> 14:30.662
Look, Sheldon, you're not gonna
convince me to come here.

14:30.662 --> 14:31.997
You're wasting your time.

14:31.997 --> 14:33.207
(sighs)

14:33.207 --> 14:35.792
I'm afraid we have
a bigger problem.

14:35.792 --> 14:37.836
What are you talking about?

14:37.836 --> 14:39.213
(sighs)

14:39.213 --> 14:41.798
I'm a scientist,
and I have to follow the data

14:41.798 --> 14:44.760
wherever it leads,
whether I like it or not.

14:44.760 --> 14:46.637
Get to the point.

14:48.013 --> 14:50.516
It seems I have a crush on you.

14:50.516 --> 14:51.892
What?

14:51.892 --> 14:53.560
I'm as surprised as you are.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.854
But I have all the symptoms
according to both Dr. Sturgis

14:55.854 --> 14:58.357
and the editors
of Sassy magazine.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.864
Uh, Sheldon,

15:05.864 --> 15:08.325
I'm really glad
that you told me this,

15:08.325 --> 15:13.705
'cause... the truth is,
I feel the same way about you.

15:13.705 --> 15:14.915
You do?

15:14.915 --> 15:16.875
I mean, I've been
trying to hide it,

15:16.875 --> 15:19.545
but now I don't have to anymore.

15:19.545 --> 15:21.004
This is such a relief.

15:21.004 --> 15:23.882
Oh, dear. This is
new information.

15:23.882 --> 15:25.342
I had been operating
under the assumption

15:25.342 --> 15:27.219
that my crush was unrequited.

15:27.219 --> 15:31.390
Oh, it's requited, Sheldon.
It's very requited.

15:31.390 --> 15:32.808
Hmm.

15:36.562 --> 15:37.980
What are you doing?

15:37.980 --> 15:39.898
We have a crush
on each other.

15:39.898 --> 15:41.066
So?

15:41.066 --> 15:43.318
Well, now we have to kiss.

15:43.318 --> 15:44.570
We do?

15:44.570 --> 15:47.865
I mean, it's where
the data has led us.

15:49.992 --> 15:52.077
I suppose.

15:52.077 --> 15:53.662
Okay.

15:53.662 --> 15:56.081
Now close your eyes
and pucker up.

16:02.004 --> 16:04.089
This might tickle.

16:07.092 --> 16:08.927
What's happening?
Are we kissing?

16:08.927 --> 16:10.387
You bet.

16:13.599 --> 16:14.766
How was that?

16:14.766 --> 16:17.019
I didn't feel anything romantic.

16:17.019 --> 16:19.605
Hmm. Me, either.

16:21.106 --> 16:23.025
I guess it wasn't
a crush after all.

16:23.025 --> 16:24.193
I guess not.

16:24.193 --> 16:27.029
Hmm. That's a relief.

16:27.029 --> 16:28.947
It is.

16:28.947 --> 16:32.075
ADULT SHELDON:I went to three classes
before I figured it out.

16:32.075 --> 16:34.745
Good thing I look spiffy
in a mustache.

16:38.999 --> 16:41.251
(door bells jingle)
Hi.

16:41.251 --> 16:43.545
Oh. Three days in a row.

16:43.545 --> 16:45.339
If you were a man, I'd think
you was in love with me.

16:45.339 --> 16:49.051
Well, this time I'm actually
gonna get a haircut.

16:49.051 --> 16:51.303
I had a little accident.

16:51.303 --> 16:53.222
Uh-oh, what happened?

16:53.222 --> 16:56.850
Well, I was sewing
and got to daydreaming...

16:59.228 --> 17:01.230
♪ ♪

17:03.106 --> 17:04.316
MISSY:
I love it.

17:04.316 --> 17:06.568
You can make all my
clothes from now on.

17:06.568 --> 17:08.070
♪ ♪

17:09.446 --> 17:11.365
I'm-a wear this to the prom.

17:11.365 --> 17:14.284
I was wrong, honey,
you really are good at this.

17:14.284 --> 17:16.453
Boy, am I dumb.

17:16.453 --> 17:18.121
(sewing machine clacking)

17:18.121 --> 17:20.290
MARY:George!

17:20.707 --> 17:22.292
George! Help!

17:22.292 --> 17:23.252
GEORGE SR.:
What?

17:23.252 --> 17:26.547
What's the matter?
My hair got tangled
in the machine.

17:26.547 --> 17:27.965
So pull it out.

17:27.965 --> 17:29.842
Don't you think
I thought of that?!

17:29.842 --> 17:31.802
Well, what do you want me to do?

17:31.802 --> 17:33.595
All right, don't move.

17:34.388 --> 17:36.056
And here we are.

17:36.056 --> 17:39.935
Okay. Let's get that hat off
and see what we're dealing with.

17:39.935 --> 17:42.145
I don't want to.
Oh, come on.

17:42.145 --> 17:43.897
I've been doing this
a long time.

17:43.897 --> 17:46.066
I promise you I've seen worse.

17:46.066 --> 17:48.026
Oh...

17:50.779 --> 17:53.156
That's not bad at all.
