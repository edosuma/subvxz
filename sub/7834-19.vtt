01:05.265 --> 01:07.199
D'oh!

01:24.617 --> 01:28.383
Ice cream at church?
I'm intrigued, yet suspicious.

01:29.956 --> 01:31.924
Wow, look at all these flavors.

01:32.025 --> 01:34.994
"Blessed Virgin Berry,
Command-mint, Bible Gum."

01:35.095 --> 01:38.326
Or if you prefer, we also have
Unitarian ice cream.

01:38.431 --> 01:41.332
- There's nothing here.
- Exactly.

01:41.434 --> 01:44.198
One Tower of Babel
and build it to heaven.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.740
To heaven!

01:47.841 --> 01:49.832
Oh.

01:51.444 --> 01:53.571
Christ be with you.

01:56.249 --> 01:57.841
D'oh!

01:57.951 --> 02:03.321
Hi. I've created
the first intra-bovine ice-cream maker.

02:03.423 --> 02:05.391
It makes use of all four stomachs.

02:05.492 --> 02:09.223
The first being filled with
rock salt, then sugar, cream...

02:09.329 --> 02:13.060
and of course,
Freon so cold it burns me.

02:13.166 --> 02:15.532
I'll have the darkety kind.

02:15.635 --> 02:18.001
Uh, one chocolate, Mootilda.

02:22.842 --> 02:25.572
Can I have a swirl
of chocolate and vanilla?

02:25.678 --> 02:28.977
- Huh? Uh-uh!
- Oh, nonsense. You can do it.

02:29.082 --> 02:31.949
Ivan Reitman!

02:32.051 --> 02:33.746
Ow!

02:33.853 --> 02:38.187
I've never seen a brain freeze this bad.

02:38.291 --> 02:40.657
Give me 50 c.c.'s of hot fudge stat!

02:40.760 --> 02:44.924
Hold still. You're gonna feel
a slight chocolaty sensation.

02:51.337 --> 02:54.033
All right, let's welcome
this evening's entertainment.

02:54.140 --> 02:56.734
They call her
the Christian Madonna...

02:56.843 --> 02:58.811
RachelJordan!

03:01.814 --> 03:04.874
#Jesus loves me, this I'm sure #

03:04.984 --> 03:07.612
# I'm a groupie on his tour #

03:07.720 --> 03:11.178
RachelJordan? Isn't that the woman
you had a crush on, Ned?

03:11.291 --> 03:15.193
I didn't have a crush on her.

03:15.295 --> 03:18.287
- Are you blushing, Mr. Flanders?
- No, I'm not-

03:18.398 --> 03:20.832
- Leave Ned alone.
- Thank you, Homer.

03:20.934 --> 03:24.335
He can't admit he likes her
till he's sure she likes him back.

03:24.437 --> 03:26.564
And there's only
one way to find out.

03:26.673 --> 03:29.301
Does Rachel like Ned?

03:29.409 --> 03:31.934
It says I have cooties.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.411
Flanders has cooties!
Flanders has cooties!

03:38.818 --> 03:42.549
That was great. I can't believe
she found a rhyme for Hezekiah.

03:42.655 --> 03:44.623
Hey, she's coming this way!

03:44.724 --> 03:47.750
I thought you didn't like her.

03:51.931 --> 03:53.990
- Oh!
- Ned Flanders?

03:54.100 --> 03:56.625
- Now, where have you been hi-diddly-hiding?
- Uh, huh?

03:56.736 --> 03:59.671
Oh, hey, Rachel.
Well, what do you know?

03:59.772 --> 04:02.263
We both like plain vanilla
with nothin' on it.

04:02.375 --> 04:04.366
Actually, all the toppings were gone.

04:06.512 --> 04:10.414
Ants are crawling in my mouth,
and I don't care.

04:10.516 --> 04:12.416
So, uh, where's your band?

04:12.518 --> 04:15.282
They switched from
Christian music to regular pop.

04:15.388 --> 04:17.583
All you do
is change "Jesus" to "baby."

04:17.690 --> 04:20.454
- Oh, how horrible.
- Uh! They'll all go to hell.

04:20.560 --> 04:25.497
- Say, how's your life going?
- Ooh, she wants to know how your life is going.

04:25.598 --> 04:30.035
Well, my wife's passing was rough.
But I think I'm finally ready to move on.

04:30.136 --> 04:33.105
That's great.
Maybe we could have coffee sometime.

04:33.206 --> 04:36.698
Oh, she wants to have
coffee sometime!

04:36.809 --> 04:40.370
- I can hear her, Homer!
- He can hear you, Rachel!

04:40.480 --> 04:44.746
I'd love to get together, but tomorrow
I've got lifeguard duty at the baptismal pool.

04:44.851 --> 04:46.876
Okay.
Well, maybe another time.

04:46.986 --> 04:48.954
You know, I'd better
go check into my hotel.

04:49.055 --> 04:51.785
Hotel?
Why don't you just stay at Ned's place?

04:51.891 --> 04:53.518
My place?
What would the neighbors think?

04:53.626 --> 04:55.457
We're the neighbors,
and we don't think.

04:55.561 --> 04:59.395
Ned, I understand if you feel uncomfortable.
You're still getting over your wife.

04:59.499 --> 05:01.626
Now, wait just
a Maude-gone minute here!

05:01.734 --> 05:04.669
I'm through livin' in the past,
and you can see for yourself.

05:09.075 --> 05:11.839
Well, you've certainly
got a theme going.

05:11.944 --> 05:15.141
All right, I'll take the couch,
and you can have my room.

05:15.248 --> 05:17.614
Oh, uh, could you sleep
on my side?

05:17.717 --> 05:19.912
I'm trying to preserve
Maude's indentation.

05:20.887 --> 05:22.855
- Sorry.
- Oh, no problem!

05:22.955 --> 05:25.014
A little starch'll fix her right up.

05:26.292 --> 05:28.317
Cold, huh?

05:28.428 --> 05:30.419
This should keep you toasty.

05:30.530 --> 05:33.431
How about that?
It says "Maude."

05:33.533 --> 05:37.060
Mmm, I love chenille. Don't you?

05:37.170 --> 05:39.138
I don't love it.
I don't hate it.

05:39.238 --> 05:41.968
Mmm, well, good night, Maude.
I mean, Maude.

05:42.075 --> 05:44.839
I mean, Rachel!
I mean, Maude.

05:44.944 --> 05:46.844
Oop!

05:55.955 --> 06:00.051
Oh, my God! You're trying to make me
look like your dead wife!

06:00.159 --> 06:03.253
No, no! L-l- I know this is,
uh, a tad unseemly.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.627
But if you just let me
even out the back-

06:05.732 --> 06:09.600
I'm calling a cab!
Good-bye, Ned!

06:09.702 --> 06:12.398
Oh, who am I kidding?

06:12.505 --> 06:14.473
I'm not over Maude at all.

06:14.574 --> 06:17.475
<i>Yeah, maybe it was too soon.</i>

06:17.577 --> 06:20.978
Well?
Aren't you gonna invite me in?

06:22.648 --> 06:25.549
I sure appreciate you folks offering
to go through Maude's things.

06:25.651 --> 06:27.915
If it were up to me,
I wouldn't throw anything away.

06:28.020 --> 06:32.184
Oh, don't you worry. We'll make all
the hard decisions so you don't have to.

06:32.291 --> 06:35.192
- We can take whatever we want, right?
- Ye-What?

06:35.294 --> 06:39.230
Don't listen to him.
You just have a good time at the eye doctor.

06:39.332 --> 06:41.232
Always do!

06:41.334 --> 06:43.199
- Say, "Bye, Mr. Flanders."
- Bye, Mr. Flanders!

06:46.706 --> 06:48.674
<i>Poor Ned.</i>

06:48.775 --> 06:51.744
<i>He can't look anywhere without</i>
<i>being reminded of Maude.</i>

06:51.844 --> 06:54.904
Yeah, a lifetime of memories.

06:55.014 --> 06:57.482
Homer, don't you have any respect?

06:57.583 --> 07:00.211
Sure. Of course I do.
But life goes on.

07:00.319 --> 07:02.287
Ashes to ashes.
Turn, turn, turn.

07:02.388 --> 07:04.356
Long live rock, and so forth.

07:06.559 --> 07:09.528
Don't throw this away.
It's Rod's first tooth.

07:09.629 --> 07:11.654
You're right.
We could use this for witchcraft.

07:11.764 --> 07:15.325
Wow.
Three pairs of shoes.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.494
Someone had a fetish.

07:20.506 --> 07:22.531
Man, this is taking forever.

07:22.642 --> 07:24.701
I know how to speed things up.

07:30.483 --> 07:33.111
Her pillow's stuck.

07:36.222 --> 07:40.318
<i>Oh, my.</i>
<i>The room looks so bare.</i>

07:40.426 --> 07:43.953
- Are you okay, Ned?
- Yeah, just a little shocked.

07:44.063 --> 07:45.997
What's that?
Some kind of sorting machine?

07:46.098 --> 07:47.998
Kinda.

07:50.736 --> 07:53.603
Now for the awkward part.
We gotta talk about money.

07:53.706 --> 07:55.901
You said we were doing this out of friendship.

07:56.008 --> 07:57.703
What?
That doesn't sound like me.

07:57.810 --> 08:00.404
Hey, Dad.
Something didn't get, um, "sorted."

08:00.513 --> 08:04.950
Maude's old sketchbook.
She was quite the little artist, you know.

08:05.051 --> 08:07.417
Oh, eh, is that a fact?
And you think you know someone.

08:07.520 --> 08:10.785
There's our house.
A rainbow.

08:10.890 --> 08:13.791
Oh, a white hand
shaking a black hand.

08:15.862 --> 08:17.830
"Praiseland"?

08:17.930 --> 08:20.364
"Rides, food"?
A"tithing pond"?

08:20.466 --> 08:24.027
- <i>It looks like an amusement park.</i>
- You're right!

08:24.136 --> 08:26.502
Maude designed
a Christian amusement park.

08:26.606 --> 08:29.632
- Oh, it must've been her final dream.
- Hey, how about that?

08:29.742 --> 08:31.710
Let's build it for her, Daddy.

08:31.811 --> 08:33.779
Oh, that's a nice thought, Toddy.

08:33.880 --> 08:39.318
But to build an amusement park, you need
lots of money and manpower and turnstiles.

08:39.418 --> 08:41.215
But Mommy wanted it.

08:52.465 --> 08:55.730
- Hmm?
- But where do you put something that big?

08:55.835 --> 08:58.133
You could fix up
the old Storytime Village.

08:58.237 --> 09:01.035
They've been out of business
ever since that kid got his head cut off.

09:01.140 --> 09:03.973
- That sounds perfect.
- Well, what the heck?

09:04.076 --> 09:07.671
- Who's ready to build an amusement park?
- Yea!

09:09.515 --> 09:11.983
Sell Storytime Village?

09:12.084 --> 09:14.416
Why, you gotta be off your tuffet!

09:14.520 --> 09:17.182
Well, it's been closed
for so long, and l-

09:17.290 --> 09:20.657
I thought I could turn it
into a Christian theme park.

09:20.760 --> 09:24.287
Christian, eh?
Well, that's different.

09:24.397 --> 09:27.093
Now, the thing is
I don't have a lot of money.

09:27.199 --> 09:30.191
And what the hell good are you?
Beat it, you hippie!

09:30.303 --> 09:32.567
- But l-
- You're right. That was harsh.

09:32.672 --> 09:36.768
Tell you what. Maybe I could donate
the park as a tax write-off.

09:36.876 --> 09:41.711
If you could do that,
I'd make this place a shining beacon for the Lord!

09:41.814 --> 09:44.248
Ah, you are so full of it!

09:44.350 --> 09:46.318
God's grace, that is.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.387
It's really sickening...

09:48.487 --> 09:50.455
there aren't more people like you.

09:50.556 --> 09:52.524
Now get out...

09:52.625 --> 09:54.752
your pen and we'll make it official.

09:54.860 --> 09:56.828
Oh, bless you, sir!

09:59.599 --> 10:04.627
Geppetto's workshop will make
a great stable for the Nativity scene.

10:06.806 --> 10:08.774
You're doing that the sucker way.

10:08.874 --> 10:11.604
Try a little vitamin "G"!

10:14.647 --> 10:16.581
Are you nuts?

10:16.682 --> 10:21.016
Relax. It's a controlled burn.
Uh-oh.

10:30.563 --> 10:32.030
Darn teenagers
with their beer bottles.

10:32.131 --> 10:33.598
Uh, yeah. Teenagers. Huh!

10:35.801 --> 10:40.363
Ned, I'm worried about you.
You've been working nonstop for the past week.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.600
Well, it's been a tad harder
than I thought.

10:42.708 --> 10:46.337
But I'm not complaining,
'cause I work for a sweet, sweet boss.

10:46.445 --> 10:48.413
You're our foreman, Maude.

10:48.514 --> 10:52.541
She's still bossing you around
from beyond the grave? Can they do that?

10:52.652 --> 10:56.349
No, I don't mind, but my greenback stack's
gettin' kind of slack.

10:56.455 --> 10:58.923
How about asking the community
for donations?

10:59.025 --> 11:01.994
I'm not very good at begging people for stuff.

11:02.094 --> 11:05.825
I am. I'd be glad to spearhead
the entire begging initiative.

11:05.931 --> 11:08.331
- Oh, thanks, Homer.
- No problem.

11:08.434 --> 11:10.402
I'll need a sack
and something sharp.

11:11.804 --> 11:14.671
Well, I guess I could
donate these costumes.

11:14.774 --> 11:17.208
They're from my Last Supper
pie-throwing sketch.

11:17.309 --> 11:21.746
<i>You can have these, uh, fireworks I confiscated.</i>

11:21.847 --> 11:25.613
Some Chinese people claimed they were
celebrating New Year's in February.

11:25.718 --> 11:29.654
Oh, yeah. Those guys and their crazy scams.

11:32.291 --> 11:34.259
Good food though.

11:35.661 --> 11:39.597
This sawdust'll soak up the puke
from the roller coaster.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.724
That's Willie's special blend.

11:43.836 --> 11:46.236
Do I detect a hint of cinnamon?

11:46.338 --> 11:48.306
Oh, I'll never tell.

11:48.407 --> 11:51.433
Praiseland amusement park
has its grand opening today.

11:51.544 --> 11:55.173
We now go live to its founder,
Mr. Nedward Flanders.

11:55.281 --> 11:58.079
Oh, morning, Kent.
Our volunteers have done an amazing job...

11:58.184 --> 12:00.152
getting the park ready here.

12:00.252 --> 12:02.743
We're gonna show Springfield
that faith and devotion...

12:02.855 --> 12:06.256
are the wildest thrill rides of all.

12:06.358 --> 12:09.452
All right. I hear the mayor's arriving
for the ribbon cutting.

12:11.864 --> 12:15.823
It is with great pride that I dedicate
this new school, sports arena or attraction.

12:28.981 --> 12:32.917
Well, Maude, your dream
has finally come true.

12:37.757 --> 12:41.193
Halt!
Who dares to disturb King David?

12:42.595 --> 12:45.223
Silence!
You have invaded the chamber...

12:45.331 --> 12:49.267
where I wrote all of my 150 psalms.

12:49.368 --> 12:53.668
I hope you enjoy hearing them all.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.435
Number one.
"Blessed is the man...

12:56.542 --> 13:00.000
who does not walk in the council of the wicked."

13:01.080 --> 13:03.048
What do you hit 'em with?

13:03.149 --> 13:06.744
- There's no mallet.
- You can stop Satan with your faith.

13:06.852 --> 13:10.788
- My face? You callin' me ugly?
- No, no, no, no. I think you're beautiful.

13:10.890 --> 13:14.053
Oh, that's it!

13:14.160 --> 13:16.822
Ooh, what can I get you,
little Christian?

13:16.929 --> 13:19.454
How about a Noah's Ark of jellies?

13:19.565 --> 13:21.590
Oh, are there two of every flavor?

13:21.700 --> 13:25.192
- Nope. They're all the same- plain.
- Oh.

13:25.304 --> 13:27.272
How about a Maude mask?

13:27.373 --> 13:30.399
I'm Maude. God is super!

13:30.509 --> 13:32.477
Can I sit in the car?

13:32.578 --> 13:34.910
- Let's both sit in the car.
- Bye-bye.

13:35.014 --> 13:38.814
A Bible park without beer?
Now I've seen everything!

13:38.918 --> 13:40.317
And this candy is subpar.

13:40.419 --> 13:42.887
Any religion that embraces carob
is, uh, not for Carl Carlson.

13:49.395 --> 13:51.363
Oh! Hey, get out of the way, pal.
You're blocking the exit.

13:51.463 --> 13:54.432
- Oh, you want me to stamp your
hand so you can get back in?
- Don't you dare!

13:54.533 --> 13:56.501
- Bye, everybody!
- What a rip-off!

13:56.602 --> 13:59.469
- It ain't even worth torching.
- Whoa! Where's everyone going? What's wrong?

13:59.572 --> 14:02.040
This place is the height of tedium.

14:02.141 --> 14:04.109
Yarr! She blows!

14:09.949 --> 14:15.080
Oh, Maude, I turned your dream of a Christian
amusement park into a <i>bemusement</i> park.

14:15.187 --> 14:17.747
- Don't say that, Ned!
- It is!

14:17.857 --> 14:20.917
It's a bemusement park!

14:23.329 --> 14:26.890
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
Oh, please, don't look at me like that!

14:36.308 --> 14:39.300
It's a miracle!

14:39.411 --> 14:43.541
It's almost like she's alive again.

14:43.649 --> 14:47.380
What's that, floating mask?
Y-You want me to shoot everyone?

14:47.486 --> 14:51.252
Nah, I'm just screwin' with ya. It's a miracle.

14:51.357 --> 14:53.848
Oh!

15:00.866 --> 15:04.165
This is fantastic.

15:04.270 --> 15:08.104
I've never been so close
to rubbing my eyes in disbelief.

15:08.207 --> 15:11.370
Oh, what the heck!
Huh? Huh?

15:11.477 --> 15:15.641
I think it's a sign from God that we
should all go nuts! Whoa-hoa!

15:15.748 --> 15:17.443
What the-

15:17.549 --> 15:19.676
Ah! What is wrong with you?

15:19.785 --> 15:22.219
- Go get that!
- Yes, ma'am.

15:25.991 --> 15:29.620
Well, looks like our phenomenon
is actually a phenome-not!

15:29.728 --> 15:32.993
Because when you look at it rationally-

15:37.569 --> 15:40.834
<i>He's speaking in tongues!</i>

15:40.940 --> 15:45.138
Oh, knock it off, Seymour!
Go find that boy with my purse!

15:45.244 --> 15:49.237
Oh! It was incredible!
I saw heaven!

15:49.348 --> 15:52.317
But it wasn't clouds and angels playing harps...

15:52.418 --> 15:54.943
like at the end of so many
Three Stooges shorts.

15:55.054 --> 15:57.022
It was a golden elementary school...

15:57.122 --> 16:00.319
with a teacher's lounge that stretched
as far as the eye could see.

16:00.426 --> 16:03.190
- And no one was ever tardy.
- Was I there?

16:03.295 --> 16:08.597
No! It was heaven- <i>my</i> vision of heaven.

16:08.701 --> 16:12.467
Oh, truly this was
the will of Maude.

16:12.571 --> 16:15.472
Hey, I want the Maude statue
to give <i>me</i> a vision!

16:15.574 --> 16:17.667
Yeah! I want to hallucinate too!

16:17.776 --> 16:20.677
I'm sorry.
The ticket price doesn't cover...

16:20.779 --> 16:24.215
visions, miracles
or other godly hoo-ha.

16:24.316 --> 16:28.252
Yeah, folks. The power of Christ compels you
to give Ned an extra 10 bucks.

16:28.354 --> 16:32.723
Homer, no! I can't exploit a divine manifestation.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.986
Oh, why not?
Everybody's doin' it.

16:35.094 --> 16:38.757
You could give the money to the orphanage.
I hear they need a new wall.

16:38.864 --> 16:41.765
Three is not enough.

16:52.711 --> 16:54.872
Maude, it's Disco Stu.

16:54.980 --> 16:58.381
Lay some heaven on me,
foxy dead chick.

16:58.484 --> 17:00.952
Ooh!

17:06.090 --> 17:09.356
Ah, Disco Stu.
Right this way.

17:09.461 --> 17:13.056
But, hey, Saint Peter, you just said,
like, you was full.

17:13.165 --> 17:15.963
- Oh, yeah!
- Ah, geez.

17:16.068 --> 17:18.935
Ah! Ooh! Ah!

17:19.038 --> 17:23.270
- Whoa, Frank Sinatra!
- For me, this is hell. You dig, pally?

17:23.375 --> 17:25.137
Ah, ah!

17:30.716 --> 17:33.549
- Who's next?
- That would be me. Thank you, sonny.

17:45.397 --> 17:49.060
My chair!
It's... got a mind of its own!

17:49.168 --> 17:52.604
- Help me, Mr. Spock!
- Shazbot! My captain is in peril.

17:56.909 --> 18:00.345
You saved the captain's life.
I want to make out with you.

18:00.446 --> 18:02.710
And so do Catwoman and Agent 99.

18:04.616 --> 18:06.709
Oh!

18:06.819 --> 18:09.413
How come everybody's
having visions, Daddy?

18:09.521 --> 18:12.081
Oh, there's no explaining
God's will, Roddy.

18:12.191 --> 18:15.092
That's like explaining
how an airplane flies.

18:15.194 --> 18:19.995
Stupid grill! Why won't you light?
The gas is on full blast.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.567
You better stick your head in
and see what's goin' on.

18:22.668 --> 18:27.105
- Good idea.
- No, Dad! I think there's a leak in the line!

18:27.206 --> 18:29.470
Leak in the line?

18:39.151 --> 18:43.645
Oh, no!
This isn't a divine miracle.

18:43.755 --> 18:46.383
Everyone's just gettin'
goofy from the gas.

18:50.129 --> 18:53.223
Uh- Uh, folks, I just discovered...

18:53.332 --> 18:57.496
eh, something about this statue that,
uh, <i>may</i> disappoint you.

18:57.603 --> 18:59.696
You see-

19:01.373 --> 19:03.671
What is it, Mr. Flanders?

19:03.775 --> 19:06.369
Is something wrong with the miracle?

19:06.478 --> 19:11.108
Will there still be money for the orphans?

19:14.019 --> 19:18.046
Hello, gas company?
How poisonous is your gas?

19:18.157 --> 19:22.890
Wow. Bu- Eh- But I'm talking about,
you know, outdoors with plenty of ventilation.

19:22.995 --> 19:26.021
That- How could that be worse?

19:26.131 --> 19:29.100
Okay, permanent brain damage
or just temporary?

19:29.201 --> 19:31.169
I see.

19:31.270 --> 19:34.433
I gotta close Praiseland down.
Someone could get hurt.

19:34.540 --> 19:36.508
"Could" get hurt.

19:36.608 --> 19:38.576
"Could."
There's a chance they won't.

19:44.616 --> 19:46.584
Ned, Praiseland has
touched an entire town...

19:46.685 --> 19:49.654
with its inspiring message
and toxic super freak-outs!

19:49.755 --> 19:52.747
Look at those smiling faces.
Rich laughing with poor.

19:52.858 --> 19:55.827
<i>Bullies breaking bread with nerds.</i>

19:55.928 --> 20:00.160
<i>Orphans lighting candles over a leaking gas line.</i>
<i>Lighting candles?</i>

20:04.703 --> 20:08.366
No-o-o!

20:08.473 --> 20:11.237
I can't feel my legs.

20:11.343 --> 20:13.243
I taste blood.

20:15.347 --> 20:17.872
Adults attacking orphans?

20:17.983 --> 20:22.113
- I don't think Maude Flanders
would approve of that.
- Absolutely not!

20:22.221 --> 20:24.189
- Never!
- No friggin' way!

20:24.289 --> 20:27.156
Yeah.
This place is more like "Crazeland."

20:27.259 --> 20:29.625
- <i>Huh?</i>
- Instead of"Praiseland."

20:29.728 --> 20:33.323
- <i>Oh!</i>
- I see.
- It's a play on words.

20:38.870 --> 20:43.830
May the Lord have mercy on your gas-sniffin',
orphan-beatin' soul!

20:43.942 --> 20:46.467
Christ be with you!

20:46.578 --> 20:50.878
Hey, Ned! I just read about your park
in that horrible triple "A" magazine.

20:50.983 --> 20:55.044
Ooh, Ned, look who's here.
It's that girl you don't like.

20:55.153 --> 20:58.350
Not!

20:58.457 --> 21:00.687
Hey, your hair's
grown back real nice.

21:00.792 --> 21:04.785
It's a wig.
And let's never speak of it again.

21:04.896 --> 21:08.957
- So what happened here?
- How about I explain it to you over a cup of coffee?

21:09.067 --> 21:11.467
That is if you're willing
to give me another shot.

21:21.813 --> 21:24.281
Are you sure you
want to do this, Ned?

21:24.383 --> 21:26.283
I'm sure.

21:32.057 --> 21:35.993
- So how about a movie tomorrow night?
- Sounds great.

21:36.094 --> 21:39.393
I think Ned is gonna be all right.

21:49.441 --> 21:52.535
<i># Get dancin', dancin', dance #</i>

21:56.214 --> 21:58.239
