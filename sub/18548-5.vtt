00:23.660 --> 00:26.139
If you're expecting a tip,
you can think again!

00:26.140 --> 00:28.380
And bring those into the
house will you?

00:30.506 --> 00:32.701
First left off the landing!

00:41.100 --> 00:43.500
I paid you to move it,
not break it!

00:44.980 --> 00:47.380
Ugh, imbeciles.

00:47.771 --> 00:49.171
God!

00:55.140 --> 00:57.060
Argh!
GLASS SHATTERS

01:34.420 --> 01:36.020
CAR HORN

01:37.180 --> 01:38.940
Silly girl!

01:38.980 --> 01:40.820
Sorry, just testing my horn.

01:42.660 --> 01:43.687
Thanks, Bunty.

01:46.860 --> 01:49.859
Lulu And Lucia... Rings a bell.

01:49.860 --> 01:52.980
From what I hear
it's nothing but filth.

01:53.020 --> 01:55.220
It's frightfully saucy.
You should give it a read.

01:55.260 --> 01:56.620
No, thank you very much.

01:56.660 --> 01:58.980
It's filled with disreputable
characters.

01:59.020 --> 02:00.939
My absolute fave is Lulu...

02:00.940 --> 02:02.739
Lucia's secret lover.

02:02.740 --> 02:04.860
Now that's more
than I need to know.

02:04.900 --> 02:07.620
Oh, maybe you'd probably prefer
Cardinal Vogel the handsome gigolo.

02:07.660 --> 02:08.859
Oh!

02:08.860 --> 02:11.619
Oh, I'm going to try and get it
signed now the author's local.

02:11.620 --> 02:13.900
Local? Just moved into the area.

02:13.940 --> 02:16.740
Finally someone in Kembleford
with a little bit of spunk.

02:16.780 --> 02:18.340
But have you not heard?

02:18.380 --> 02:20.459
Lucia Morell was attacked -

02:20.460 --> 02:21.699
blinded in one eye.

02:21.700 --> 02:23.820
Really?! Uh-huh.

02:35.020 --> 02:36.860
Lucia...

02:36.900 --> 02:38.899
Am I really that ugly?

02:38.900 --> 02:41.740
Don't go anywhere near her.

02:41.780 --> 02:43.380
I'll do as I please

02:43.420 --> 02:44.980
and you won't stop me!

02:47.140 --> 02:48.699
It's just like one of her novels -

02:48.700 --> 02:50.780
intrigue and mystery attackers...

02:50.820 --> 02:52.979
This is not some made-up story.

02:52.980 --> 02:54.779
A woman has been maimed.

02:54.780 --> 02:56.579
Quite.

02:56.580 --> 02:58.580
I wonder what the attacker
was after?

02:58.620 --> 03:00.420
Perhaps they were trying
to bump her off?

03:00.460 --> 03:02.660
Oh, now you're just getting
carried away.

03:03.900 --> 03:06.940
Lucia said in her interview
she was going to reveal

03:06.980 --> 03:09.380
who Lulu was based upon
in her next novel.

03:14.660 --> 03:18.300
Mmm. You think someone was trying
to protect the real Lulu's identity?

03:18.340 --> 03:21.140
According to this, Lulu could
be any one of 20 women.

03:27.780 --> 03:29.260
How do I look?

03:29.300 --> 03:30.300
Fine.

03:31.540 --> 03:34.340
No offence, but don't you think
she's just a little...

03:34.380 --> 03:36.580
What, out of my league?

03:36.620 --> 03:38.300
Undoubtedly.

03:38.340 --> 03:40.299
But...

03:40.300 --> 03:41.660
here goes nothing.

03:52.460 --> 03:53.860
Oh, damn!

04:04.340 --> 04:06.259
Anything?

04:06.260 --> 04:08.460
Hm?

04:08.500 --> 04:10.180
HE SIGHS

04:10.220 --> 04:11.780
Are you all right, Father?

04:11.820 --> 04:13.899
You look a little...

04:13.900 --> 04:15.540
constipated.

04:15.580 --> 04:17.418
I beg your pardon?!

04:17.420 --> 04:19.499
I meant mentally.

04:19.500 --> 04:21.540
It's staring me in the face,
I know it is...

04:22.740 --> 04:25.019
Lulu. Lu... lu?

04:25.020 --> 04:26.300
You'll never get it.

04:29.620 --> 04:31.100
Number 14.

04:33.300 --> 04:34.980
Ursula Lansford?

04:35.020 --> 04:37.100
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

04:37.140 --> 04:40.820
Lady Ursula Lansford
of Uxbridge...

04:41.940 --> 04:43.620
L-U-L-U.

04:43.660 --> 04:46.260
Lulu...
Father, you're a genius...

04:46.300 --> 04:49.660
Lady Ursula is a respected
charity worker

04:49.700 --> 04:52.740
who takes in young women
just out of prison.

04:53.900 --> 04:56.379
Well, I intend to pay a social call
on Miss Morell

04:56.380 --> 04:57.580
to get my book signed.

04:57.620 --> 04:58.820
You should come along, Father.

04:58.860 --> 05:01.060
Father has his homily to write.

05:01.100 --> 05:02.939
Isn't that right, Father?

05:02.940 --> 05:04.540
Yes.

05:04.580 --> 05:06.020
Of all people.

05:06.060 --> 05:08.220
Accusing Lady Ursula!

05:13.540 --> 05:14.860
Ursula.

05:16.100 --> 05:17.300
Darling!

05:18.660 --> 05:20.980
You look stunning...

05:21.020 --> 05:23.020
as ever.

05:24.460 --> 05:25.740
But the glasses...

05:27.100 --> 05:28.300
Migraine.

05:28.340 --> 05:30.300
Oh, poor you...

05:30.340 --> 05:31.620
Don't!

05:33.380 --> 05:35.620
I told you a long time ago
not to contact me.

05:35.660 --> 05:37.060
Mmm.

05:38.780 --> 05:41.580
But I need your help.

05:44.580 --> 05:45.740
Not this time.

05:47.380 --> 05:49.659
You helped me after the fire.

05:49.660 --> 05:51.260
Why not again?

05:51.300 --> 05:53.220
I've changed.

05:53.260 --> 05:55.500
Oh...
SHE CHUCKLES

05:57.580 --> 06:00.780
Morning, Mother. Shall I make some
tea for you and your guest?

06:00.820 --> 06:03.060
Not now, James. I'm busy with...

06:05.100 --> 06:06.100
..with my work.

06:07.540 --> 06:09.460
Always are.

06:13.620 --> 06:16.540
Brimming over with maternal
instinct, I see.

06:17.900 --> 06:19.900
Should have taken my advice.

06:19.940 --> 06:21.739
Gotten rid.

06:21.740 --> 06:23.300
He means everything to me.

06:24.780 --> 06:28.460
There was a time
when I was all you needed.

06:29.700 --> 06:31.780
Do you ever think about what we had?

06:34.260 --> 06:37.780
The nights we spent together,
our bodies aching,

06:37.820 --> 06:39.540
dripping with sweat...

06:41.660 --> 06:45.700
..but it wasn't just physical,
was it?

06:48.180 --> 06:49.940
Just say your piece and go!

06:57.300 --> 06:58.860
Very well.

07:01.860 --> 07:03.780
The thing is...

07:03.820 --> 07:08.619
I can't get a publishing deal
for my next novel.

07:08.620 --> 07:13.739
Apparently my kind of
"erotica" is old hat...

07:13.740 --> 07:15.340
You want money?

07:15.380 --> 07:18.900
I've had to move into some hovel
on the edge of the village.

07:18.940 --> 07:21.060
It just isn't me, darling.

07:21.100 --> 07:24.099
My finances are tied up in
this place. Then sell it!

07:24.100 --> 07:25.900
This is not just my home.

07:25.940 --> 07:29.779
It's a place where ex-offenders
can live and start again.

07:29.780 --> 07:31.300
How very selfless.

07:31.340 --> 07:35.020
My aim is to open up the entire
house so that others can stay.

07:35.060 --> 07:38.059
Oh, you're really starting to
bore me now, darling.

07:38.060 --> 07:42.380
You either sell this place and give
me half the profits

07:42.420 --> 07:45.900
or I'll reveal to the press

07:45.940 --> 07:50.140
that my fictional lover
was based on you.

07:51.740 --> 07:54.660
I don't care what my peers
think any more.

07:54.700 --> 07:57.700
Does your son know about your past?

08:00.260 --> 08:02.900
If you go anywhere near him, I'll...

08:02.940 --> 08:05.339
You'll what?

08:05.340 --> 08:07.740
I'm warning you.

08:07.780 --> 08:11.420
You of all people

08:11.460 --> 08:13.340
know what I'm capable of.

08:28.100 --> 08:32.100
Apologies for not having
introduced myself earlier.

08:32.140 --> 08:34.219
Lucia Morell...

08:34.220 --> 08:36.219
James...

08:36.220 --> 08:37.620
That's... Oh...

08:37.659 --> 08:40.460
Yeah, I met you briefly, years ago.

08:40.500 --> 08:44.499
Yes, yes I'm an old friend
of your mother's.

08:44.500 --> 08:47.860
Now please would you be
an absolute darling

08:47.900 --> 08:49.700
and drive me home?

08:49.740 --> 08:52.020
I don't live very far.

08:52.060 --> 08:53.420
Um, right.

08:53.460 --> 08:55.060
Um, of course...

08:55.100 --> 08:56.500
SHE GIGGLES

08:56.540 --> 08:57.940
Yeah.

09:03.940 --> 09:05.380
You know...

09:06.940 --> 09:08.780
You have your mother's eyes.

09:36.540 --> 09:39.340
Oh, I-I really should be going.

09:39.380 --> 09:40.580
James...

09:40.620 --> 09:43.220
Um, now I don't wish to be rude,

09:43.260 --> 09:47.100
but you strike me as someone not
entirely very successful

09:47.140 --> 09:49.499
with the ladies. Am I right?

09:49.500 --> 09:51.340
Well, I...

09:51.380 --> 09:54.580
And one might even endeavour
to say that, um...

09:56.300 --> 09:59.220
..that you're still a novice.

10:00.140 --> 10:01.500
Am I right?

10:02.940 --> 10:05.260
Oh, my poor darling.

10:06.820 --> 10:09.259
And the problem will only get worse.

10:09.260 --> 10:13.900
You see, women can smell
desperation on a man.

10:13.940 --> 10:16.540
And you, my poor love...

10:16.580 --> 10:20.019
you positively reek of it.

10:20.020 --> 10:25.260
Now, what you need is
a woman of the world to teach you,

10:25.300 --> 10:30.140
so that you'll have the confidence
to charm any girl you want...

10:30.180 --> 10:31.860
Hm?

10:31.900 --> 10:32.980
So...

10:34.540 --> 10:36.659
Would you like a lesson, James?

10:36.660 --> 10:38.220
Hm?

10:44.100 --> 10:45.900
I am very sorry,

10:45.940 --> 10:49.620
but I simply cannot let that woman's
daughter join the choir.

10:49.660 --> 10:52.860
But she's got such a beautiful
voice, and she's really very keen.

10:52.900 --> 10:55.099
Well, beautiful voice, or not,

10:55.100 --> 10:57.540
until she is willing to lower
the hem of her skirt and...

10:57.580 --> 11:00.220
Spot of brunch and then off to
Lucia Morell's house.

11:00.260 --> 11:01.420
Care to join me?

11:09.380 --> 11:11.939
I'm all for young people
joining the choir,

11:11.940 --> 11:14.379
but we do have our
standards to keep up.

11:14.380 --> 11:16.220
Isn't that right, Father?

11:21.980 --> 11:23.859
Sorry, it must have been nerves.

11:23.860 --> 11:28.299
I could comfort you with cliches
about how it doesn't matter

11:28.300 --> 11:30.739
and how it happens to all men.

11:30.740 --> 11:33.100
But I'm sorry, my love...

11:33.140 --> 11:35.579
it's just not true.

11:35.580 --> 11:37.940
No wonder you're still a virgin.

11:37.980 --> 11:41.219
You were absolutely pathetic...

11:41.220 --> 11:47.540
Please... I've had hundreds of men,
and never one SO inadequate.

11:47.580 --> 11:49.660
You're like a little boy, really,
aren't you?

11:49.700 --> 11:53.459
No... Did Ursula not give you
the attention you needed?

11:53.460 --> 11:57.099
Too busy with her charity work
to notice her own son.

11:57.100 --> 12:00.540
Is that why you took
comfort in eating?

12:02.500 --> 12:06.659
You will never satisfy a woman.

12:06.660 --> 12:08.460
You've got to face facts.

12:08.500 --> 12:12.499
You're just a big, fat baby

12:12.500 --> 12:15.140
who can't rise to the occasion!

12:15.180 --> 12:16.459
Shut up!

12:16.460 --> 12:18.220
HE SOBS

12:21.820 --> 12:24.700
Put your clothes on and go home!

12:32.620 --> 12:34.660
After all she's done for us.

12:34.700 --> 12:36.580
Lady Ursula doesn't deserve this.

12:36.620 --> 12:39.699
If that one-eyed crow gets her way,
we'll all end up on the street.

12:39.700 --> 12:41.460
Yeah.

12:41.500 --> 12:43.140
We should pay her a visit.

12:46.260 --> 12:47.660
One moment.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.140
Sir.

12:49.180 --> 12:51.739
Lucia Morell wants to know when
you're going to interview her

12:51.740 --> 12:54.220
about the attack, now she's
out of hospital. Give it here.

12:55.620 --> 12:57.260
Inspector Mallory speaking.

12:59.220 --> 13:01.060
Yes, I'll try and call later.

13:03.260 --> 13:04.540
I-I beg your pardon?

13:06.980 --> 13:10.820
Interview you in your negligee?

13:10.860 --> 13:14.700
Inspector, when I'm at home

13:14.740 --> 13:18.740
I like to conduct my affairs from
the comfort of my four-poster bed.

13:19.700 --> 13:21.860
SHE CHUCKLES

13:21.900 --> 13:25.020
So you'll have to take
me as you find me...

13:25.060 --> 13:26.260
DOOR OPENS

13:26.300 --> 13:27.980
Oh, one moment...

13:28.020 --> 13:29.700
Hello?

13:32.580 --> 13:35.980
Sorry about that, Inspector...

13:36.020 --> 13:38.540
SHE SCREAMS

13:44.580 --> 13:46.020
'Miss Morell...'

13:47.380 --> 13:49.220
Miss Morell?!

14:04.780 --> 14:07.060
Rather run-down
for a famous novelist.

14:07.100 --> 14:09.540
Well, her old house
was rather magnificent

14:09.580 --> 14:11.140
until it burned to the ground,

14:11.180 --> 14:13.780
and her latest place in Evesham
was repossessed.

14:16.580 --> 14:19.060
I'm afraid you can't come
any further.

14:19.100 --> 14:20.900
Murder scene...

14:20.940 --> 14:22.620
Not Lucia Morell?

14:24.860 --> 14:27.900
So the intruder was trying
to kill her...

14:27.940 --> 14:29.420
Was anything taken?

14:32.700 --> 14:35.100
Look, I shouldn't really say,
but... yes,

14:35.140 --> 14:36.940
something WAS taken
after the murder.

14:52.020 --> 14:53.779
That's why they took the hand.

14:53.780 --> 14:56.460
In her novel, Lucia had Runic
symbols on her wrist

14:56.500 --> 14:58.580
revealing Lulu's identity.

14:58.620 --> 15:02.300
And so perhaps the real life Lucia
had the same tattoo.

15:02.340 --> 15:04.219
With Lady Ursula's name on.

15:04.220 --> 15:06.779
She must be involved in some way.

15:06.780 --> 15:09.979
Found a bunch of abusive letters,
sir. All ready to be posted...

15:09.980 --> 15:12.700
To who? Well anyone and everyone.

15:12.740 --> 15:15.940
She had a warped passion
for upsetting people.

15:15.980 --> 15:18.460
If you'd read her work
then you'd already know that.

15:18.500 --> 15:19.820
She doesn't mean anything by it.

15:22.260 --> 15:24.299
I see the old gout's back.

15:24.300 --> 15:26.100
Cut the pleasantries, padre -

15:26.140 --> 15:28.340
and keep your snout
out of my business!

15:28.380 --> 15:29.740
Charmant!

15:34.060 --> 15:36.299
Father, we should pay a visit
to Lady Ursula

15:36.300 --> 15:39.060
and pretend to be interested
in her charity, or something.

15:39.100 --> 15:42.979
So you can subtly introduce into
the conversation the death of Lucia?

15:42.980 --> 15:45.180
Exactly, and observe her reaction.

15:45.220 --> 15:49.420
Or, we can tell the
Inspector what we know.

15:49.460 --> 15:50.860
You're joking.

15:50.900 --> 15:53.140
That horrid little man
will only try and stop us.

15:57.820 --> 16:00.060
Not quite right.

16:04.420 --> 16:06.300
Mm, you're right.

16:15.500 --> 16:16.940
Something smells good.

16:16.980 --> 16:19.260
Do you work here?
We're looking for Lady Ursula...

16:19.300 --> 16:20.940
Friar Victor Novak,
I'm the gamekeeper

16:20.980 --> 16:22.780
Father Brown.

16:22.820 --> 16:24.579
What order do you belong to?

16:24.580 --> 16:26.620
None. Got thrown out.

16:26.660 --> 16:29.020
There was no answer when we knocked.

16:29.060 --> 16:31.700
Oh, go straight in.
She'll be round the back.

16:31.740 --> 16:33.540
Resting.

16:33.580 --> 16:35.180
Wait!

16:36.380 --> 16:37.819
Need a second opinion.

16:37.820 --> 16:40.060
Oh, no, it's quite all right,
we've already eaten...

16:40.100 --> 16:42.060
Please, just a spoonful.

16:42.100 --> 16:43.900
I think I've forgotten something.

16:46.780 --> 16:48.100
Mmm...

16:48.140 --> 16:50.100
It's actually not bad. Oh, more?

16:50.140 --> 16:52.820
I really shouldn't. I insist.

16:52.860 --> 16:54.860
Mmm... mm.

16:54.900 --> 16:55.900
Mm!

16:55.901 --> 16:57.700
What's in it?

16:57.740 --> 16:59.140
Rabbit, mainly.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.459
Also squirrel,

17:02.460 --> 17:05.220
and the odd vole for flavour.

17:05.260 --> 17:07.460
Is that a claw?

17:07.500 --> 17:08.540
Rodents!

17:10.140 --> 17:12.140
We should have gone
through with it.

17:12.180 --> 17:14.539
A smack in the old witch's mouth
and we'd have been sorted.

17:14.540 --> 17:17.019
What, and risk going back inside,
is that what you want?

17:17.020 --> 17:18.858
Are you all right, Mildred?

17:18.859 --> 17:20.539
Gut rot...

17:20.540 --> 17:22.260
I told you not to taste his stew!

17:23.540 --> 17:24.780
Can I help?

17:27.500 --> 17:29.780
We're visiting Lady Ursula

17:29.820 --> 17:32.339
I say are you one of the ex-cons?

17:32.340 --> 17:34.499
Yeah.

17:34.500 --> 17:35.900
Bunty Windermere.

17:35.940 --> 17:37.379
And this is Father Brown...

17:37.380 --> 17:39.219
Scarlet. Finch.

17:39.220 --> 17:42.220
Gosh, I have always wondered what
it must be like to be banged up.

17:42.260 --> 17:45.060
Thieves, murderers, molesters -
all thrown together.

17:45.100 --> 17:46.140
What's your vice?

17:47.300 --> 17:48.980
Bunty...

17:49.020 --> 17:50.659
Sorry.

17:50.660 --> 17:52.140
This way.

17:54.340 --> 17:56.060
Posh cow.

18:22.220 --> 18:28.659
So, your Aunt Felicia is interested
in investing in my charity.

18:28.660 --> 18:32.299
Well, she'd certainly like to
know more about it.

18:32.300 --> 18:38.060
But I totally understand if you feel
our visit isn't convenient.

18:38.100 --> 18:40.100
Why do you say that?

18:43.020 --> 18:45.020
Oh... you haven't heard.

18:46.620 --> 18:49.540
The novelist, Lucia Morell...

18:49.580 --> 18:51.899
She's been murdered.

18:51.900 --> 18:53.539
What?

18:53.540 --> 18:55.140
I'm sorry.

18:56.380 --> 18:58.940
I-I...

18:58.980 --> 19:00.900
I only saw her this morning...

19:02.460 --> 19:04.499
It must be a terrible shock.

19:04.500 --> 19:06.100
You were obviously very close...

19:07.260 --> 19:08.940
Close?

19:08.980 --> 19:12.460
Well, it was suggested that
you were once very good friends.

19:12.500 --> 19:14.820
That woman meant nothing to me!

19:16.300 --> 19:17.580
If you say so.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.580
Now...

19:20.620 --> 19:23.340
if you'll excuse me,

19:23.380 --> 19:24.940
I need my tablets...

19:32.300 --> 19:35.420
Well, I think the Lady
doth protest too much.

19:36.980 --> 19:39.020
STOMACH GURGLES
Oh...

19:45.420 --> 19:46.900
What is it?

19:49.580 --> 19:52.620
I'm just tired of people
walking all over me.

19:54.460 --> 19:56.380
Even my own mother does it.

20:01.460 --> 20:04.059
It's just her...

20:04.060 --> 20:05.780
her way.

20:07.660 --> 20:10.420
Well, I'm not going to let people
treat me like dirt any more.

20:13.420 --> 20:14.540
What happened?

20:16.620 --> 20:17.820
Nosebleed.

20:18.940 --> 20:20.380
When I drove Lucia home.

20:21.900 --> 20:23.380
What brought that on?

20:23.420 --> 20:24.420
I don't know!

20:33.260 --> 20:35.860
I'm so sorry.
You must think me awfully rude.

20:35.900 --> 20:38.700
It is I who should apologise.

20:38.740 --> 20:42.180
I've explained you had
some of the friar's soup.

20:42.220 --> 20:45.300
You can't possibly brave
the journey home like that.

20:45.340 --> 20:48.060
Would it help if you
had a little lie down?

20:48.100 --> 20:50.700
Well... yes. Thank you.

20:50.740 --> 20:53.940
The drawing room on your right.
It's got a comfortable couch.

20:53.980 --> 20:55.260
You're so kind.

21:03.420 --> 21:05.940
SHE PANTS

21:12.580 --> 21:14.220
Father! Father Brown!

21:17.140 --> 21:19.940
INSPECTOR MALLORY:
Nobody is to leave the grounds.

21:22.620 --> 21:26.259
Cause of death is still unclear,
sir, but it looks like poison.

21:26.260 --> 21:28.500
Well, at least none of her
body parts have gone AWOL.

21:28.540 --> 21:30.339
You think the murders are connected?

21:30.340 --> 21:33.419
It's highly likely.
Lucia Morell was here this morning.

21:33.420 --> 21:35.500
And how do you know that?

21:35.540 --> 21:38.899
Don't tell me -
the Holy Ghost told you.

21:38.900 --> 21:41.819
Actually it was Lady Ursula.

21:41.820 --> 21:44.740
I need to interview Miss Windermere.
Where's she got to?

21:52.500 --> 21:55.979
Poor thing. How are you feeling now?

21:55.980 --> 21:59.659
Well, rodents for lunch
and then discovering a corpse -

21:59.660 --> 22:01.900
I've had better days.

22:01.940 --> 22:03.020
Oh!

22:06.300 --> 22:08.059
Right, listen up.

22:08.060 --> 22:10.179
I want to start with
Lucia Morell's death

22:10.180 --> 22:12.340
seeing that she was
the first to croak...

22:15.020 --> 22:17.460
Die. Pass on.

22:18.860 --> 22:22.739
Did anyone see her
after she left here?

22:22.740 --> 22:23.740
I drove her home.

22:25.580 --> 22:26.780
And then?

22:28.820 --> 22:31.660
I left straight away

22:31.700 --> 22:33.660
and went to the White Hart.

22:33.700 --> 22:36.740
You can ask the landlord...
And when you dropped her off,

22:36.780 --> 22:39.020
did you see anyone else in the area?

22:42.460 --> 22:47.739
Spit it out, lad! He saw me and
Mildred on the road to Lucia's.

22:47.740 --> 22:49.740
We were going to scare her,

22:49.780 --> 22:52.660
try and make her stop
blackmailing Lady Ursula.

22:52.700 --> 22:54.500
Blackmail?

22:54.540 --> 22:58.260
Lucia was going to reveal that the
character of Lulu was based on her -

22:58.300 --> 23:00.700
but we only got as far as the gates.

23:00.740 --> 23:03.620
I persuaded Mildred not
to go through with it...

23:03.660 --> 23:04.980
in case we ended up back inside.

23:05.020 --> 23:06.780
Ah...

23:06.820 --> 23:11.099
A couple of ex-cons.
Now we're getting somewhere.

23:11.100 --> 23:12.340
It doesn't make them murderers.

23:13.540 --> 23:15.500
You know what I think?

23:15.540 --> 23:17.140
Things got out of hand

23:17.180 --> 23:20.019
and, instead of scaring her,
you killed her.

23:20.020 --> 23:21.420
No. You're lying.

23:21.460 --> 23:23.540
I saw them turn round and leave.

23:28.060 --> 23:30.179
And where were you?

23:30.180 --> 23:31.540
I was, er...

23:31.580 --> 23:33.979
er...

23:33.980 --> 23:35.460
cutting across the fields.

23:35.500 --> 23:40.739
I was going to plead with Lucia
to leave Lady Ursula alone.

23:40.740 --> 23:43.579
Is this some kind of ruddy joke?

23:43.580 --> 23:46.419
I've never seen a case
with so many suspects.

23:46.420 --> 23:49.460
Knocked on the door
but there was no answer.

23:49.500 --> 23:50.860
So...

23:53.140 --> 23:54.340
..so I went away.

23:55.780 --> 23:59.220
Right. I want written
statements from all of you.

23:59.260 --> 24:01.020
We'll start with you.

24:01.060 --> 24:02.060
Follow me.

24:12.260 --> 24:14.860
If you ever need to talk...

24:14.900 --> 24:18.100
Thank you.
But we weren't close friends.

24:18.140 --> 24:20.540
We just watched each
other's backs inside.

24:22.500 --> 24:25.780
I hear you're a bit of
an amateur sleuth, Father.

24:25.820 --> 24:27.420
I dabble.

24:27.460 --> 24:31.300
Well, I hope you find the killer
before that copper fits me up.

24:31.340 --> 24:33.140
I've met his type before.

24:34.580 --> 24:35.580
Mm.

24:42.580 --> 24:44.660
I'm not sure they're your size.

24:44.700 --> 24:45.860
Routine search.

24:47.500 --> 24:48.980
Oh, not again.

24:50.820 --> 24:52.020
Ooh!

24:53.260 --> 24:54.299
RETCHING

24:54.300 --> 24:56.220
FLUSH

24:56.260 --> 24:57.700
Sergeant!

24:59.780 --> 25:01.300
What's happened? Look!

25:15.220 --> 25:16.460
SHE GASPS

25:34.940 --> 25:36.500
Why would someone do that?

25:38.260 --> 25:40.940
Are you all right?

25:40.980 --> 25:42.700
I think so.

25:42.740 --> 25:45.820
It'll help settle your tummy.
Oh, thank you.

25:45.860 --> 25:48.339
Is that what you said to Mildred...

25:48.340 --> 25:49.980
before you poisoned her?

25:51.380 --> 25:52.699
Sorry?

25:52.700 --> 25:55.700
Where were you at 11:20 today?

25:55.740 --> 25:58.299
I spent most of the morning
alone in my bedroom.

25:58.300 --> 26:00.140
I had a migraine.

26:00.180 --> 26:02.300
So, no alibi.

26:03.620 --> 26:06.620
Lucia's hand was found
in your cistern...

26:06.660 --> 26:08.580
in your private bathroom

26:08.620 --> 26:11.300
and, since she was blackmailing you,

26:11.340 --> 26:14.700
you have, by far,
the strongest motive.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.540
You're not serious!

26:18.180 --> 26:20.540
Lady Ursula,
I'm arresting you on suspicion...

26:20.580 --> 26:21.780
I killed Lucia!

26:23.980 --> 26:25.420
You?

26:25.460 --> 26:27.980
I lied. I climbed in through
a window and...

26:29.220 --> 26:31.140
..and...

26:31.180 --> 26:34.460
I had to protect
Lady Ursula's reputation.

26:34.500 --> 26:36.060
By cutting Lucia's hand off?

26:37.780 --> 26:40.300
The tattoo spelled out
Ursula's name.

26:41.940 --> 26:46.419
But why then put
the hand in her bathroom?

26:46.420 --> 26:48.619
I...

26:48.620 --> 26:52.339
hid it in a bag...

26:52.340 --> 26:55.100
put it in with the birds...

26:55.140 --> 26:57.620
but someone stole it.

26:59.620 --> 27:01.619
Let's try again.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.420
Friar Novak, I'm arresting you

27:03.460 --> 27:06.300
on suspicion of the murder
of Lucia Morell.

27:13.620 --> 27:14.740
This way, sir.

27:21.940 --> 27:24.099
So who killed Mildred?

27:24.100 --> 27:25.980
Friar Fruitcake.

27:26.020 --> 27:30.699
So you think he poisoned her
because she took Lucia's hand and...

27:30.700 --> 27:32.379
Back off, padre.

27:32.380 --> 27:35.340
In case you've forgotten,
I'm the detective round here.

27:35.380 --> 27:37.140
So sling your cassock.

27:41.860 --> 27:44.860
So this Lulu character
is based on you?

27:44.900 --> 27:47.700
It was a long time ago.
I don't want to talk about it.

27:56.580 --> 28:00.860
I'm sorry, Father.
It's all rather too much.

28:02.180 --> 28:04.780
I never had Father Novak
down as a killer.

28:05.820 --> 28:07.580
Well...

28:07.620 --> 28:11.460
he was always willing
to stand up for my honour.

28:11.500 --> 28:14.380
He thought I regretted
my affair with Lucia.

28:15.780 --> 28:18.140
But you didn't?

28:18.180 --> 28:21.379
I ended it because of her sadism.

28:21.380 --> 28:23.299
She genuinely...

28:23.300 --> 28:24.900
hated people.

28:26.140 --> 28:29.020
I know I should have run
a mile from her, but...

28:30.420 --> 28:32.620
..she was so...

28:32.660 --> 28:34.420
alluring back then.

28:34.460 --> 28:36.340
So...

28:36.380 --> 28:37.540
dangerous.

28:39.100 --> 28:41.220
You were in love.

28:41.260 --> 28:43.059
No.

28:43.060 --> 28:45.620
It was much stronger
than love, Father.

28:46.660 --> 28:50.060
There was a time when...

28:50.100 --> 28:51.900
when...

28:51.940 --> 28:54.340
I would have died for her.

28:59.220 --> 29:00.260
KEY TURNS IN LOCK

29:08.220 --> 29:10.580
I won't ask if you slept well.

29:13.060 --> 29:16.300
I don't need spiritual guidance,
Father.

29:16.340 --> 29:18.379
Then I won't give you any.

29:18.380 --> 29:20.140
One thing troubles me.

29:20.180 --> 29:22.659
If you took the hand
to protect Lady Ursula,

29:22.660 --> 29:26.659
why didn't you destroy it? Burn it?

29:26.660 --> 29:30.100
I didn't have time.
Now, please, just leave me alone.

29:30.140 --> 29:31.459
Odd that you confessed

29:31.460 --> 29:33.820
only when they were about
to arrest Lady Ursula.

29:36.220 --> 29:38.820
What hold does she have over you?

29:38.860 --> 29:41.860
Don't speak of her in that way!

29:41.900 --> 29:43.900
Ah...

29:43.940 --> 29:44.940
Love.

29:46.780 --> 29:51.779
It's far more complicated
than just two people...

29:51.780 --> 29:53.540
loving each other.

30:03.820 --> 30:07.619
Mrs McCarthy, I need your help.

30:07.620 --> 30:14.180
Several of the clues so far have
come from the novel Lulu and Lucia.

30:14.220 --> 30:16.019
Lulu's identity, the hand.

30:16.020 --> 30:18.460
So, Bunty's had an idea...

30:19.780 --> 30:22.459
I thought if we all read
separate chapters

30:22.460 --> 30:24.940
then perhaps more clues will pop up.

30:24.980 --> 30:28.819
Oh, I should have thought you'd
know every sordid detail by now.

30:28.820 --> 30:31.620
Well, you can't expect me
to remember all of them.

30:31.660 --> 30:33.700
Chapter six, Mrs M.

30:33.740 --> 30:35.859
Father, is this really necessary?

30:35.860 --> 30:39.419
Well, if it helps to
prevent more murders...

30:39.420 --> 30:40.660
Well, I suppose.

30:46.300 --> 30:48.980
'Lucia had the power to turn
any male sophisticate,

30:49.020 --> 30:51.620
'any male intellectual
into a savage beast.

30:52.780 --> 30:56.620
'There had never been brotherly
rivalry between them, until now.

30:58.260 --> 31:00.700
'With bloodlust running
through their veins,

31:00.740 --> 31:03.340
'they would fight to the death.
And the prize?

31:03.380 --> 31:04.940
'A night with Lucia.'

31:04.980 --> 31:07.980
'Cardinal Vogel had been
humiliated for the last time.

31:09.140 --> 31:11.460
'With fantasies of Lucia's murder

31:11.500 --> 31:14.980
'consuming his every thought,
he burnt the palace to the ground.

31:16.780 --> 31:20.019
'The side-splitting laughter
of those inside

31:20.020 --> 31:22.859
'now replaced by
skin-blistering screams!'

31:22.860 --> 31:24.660
SCREAMING

31:24.700 --> 31:29.500
'Lucia danced all night with
the Grand Duke of Luxembourg,

31:29.540 --> 31:33.180
'his viper eyes slithering
over her every curve...

31:34.860 --> 31:37.660
'..into every crevice of her body.

31:37.700 --> 31:40.900
'He had a desire to own

31:40.940 --> 31:44.940
'and, indeed, to soil all beauty.

31:44.980 --> 31:48.220
'He had to have Lucia.'

31:49.660 --> 31:52.860
Well... I think I need some air.

31:54.060 --> 31:56.340
Or a cold shower, more like!

31:56.380 --> 31:57.540
Penelope...

32:03.460 --> 32:04.580
James!

32:04.620 --> 32:07.459
The sooner I'm away
from here, the better.

32:07.460 --> 32:10.019
What's brought this on?

32:10.020 --> 32:12.659
I found that novel at the bookshop.

32:12.660 --> 32:14.780
James, please.

32:14.820 --> 32:17.619
The things you and Lucia did.

32:17.620 --> 32:19.939
How could you hurt so many people?

32:19.940 --> 32:23.340
She... had a hold on me.

32:23.380 --> 32:25.580
You know,
I wish my father was alive.

32:25.620 --> 32:28.540
At least then I'd have
one parent I wasn't ashamed of.

32:28.580 --> 32:30.060
You disgust me!

32:30.100 --> 32:31.660
Oh, don't say that.

32:31.700 --> 32:34.259
If I were you I'd get away from her.

32:34.260 --> 32:35.499
She's not like that any more.

32:35.500 --> 32:36.980
Why don't you come with me?

32:37.020 --> 32:39.980
James, I've told you
I'm not interested!

32:40.020 --> 32:41.820
Well, don't say I didn't warn you.

32:41.860 --> 32:44.060
You are a monster.

32:44.100 --> 32:46.739
But... where will you go?

32:46.740 --> 32:50.180
What do you care?
You never have before.

32:50.220 --> 32:57.460
James!

33:02.900 --> 33:04.380
Of all the named characters,

33:04.420 --> 33:08.460
Cardinal Vogel has the strongest
motive for harming Lucia.

33:08.500 --> 33:11.019
Whenever he pops up,
Lucia humiliates him.

33:11.020 --> 33:15.020
He's the only real candidate
for the killer other than Lulu.

33:15.060 --> 33:16.060
Hm.

33:17.820 --> 33:20.499
Why make him a gigolo?

33:20.500 --> 33:22.900
Gigolo...
another word for prostitute.

33:22.940 --> 33:27.379
So the character could be
based on a woman? It's possible.

33:27.380 --> 33:30.859
If Lulu was a pseudonym
for Lady Ursula,

33:30.860 --> 33:32.900
what does Cardinal Vogel mean?

33:34.500 --> 33:36.660
A cardinal is also a bird.

33:36.700 --> 33:38.939
Vogel - German for bird.

33:38.940 --> 33:41.499
Friar Novak and his birds!

33:41.500 --> 33:43.260
So he really is the killer.

33:45.060 --> 33:46.060
Not so sure.

33:47.700 --> 33:50.780
Cardinal red is also
a vivid colour.

33:52.260 --> 33:53.340
Red bird.

33:56.420 --> 33:57.420
That's it.

34:00.100 --> 34:01.899
SHE SIGHS

34:01.900 --> 34:05.300
I should have tried
to make him understand.

34:05.340 --> 34:08.980
No. He just doesn't know how
charitable you really are.

34:11.420 --> 34:14.539
You can't imagine how glad I am
you let me stay.

34:14.540 --> 34:18.259
Well, Mildred said you
looked out for her in prison.

34:18.260 --> 34:21.580
I only befriended her when
I found out she was staying here.

34:21.620 --> 34:22.620
It was a way in.

34:24.100 --> 34:25.100
A way in?

34:26.900 --> 34:29.339
Well, if it wasn't for you,

34:29.340 --> 34:31.980
I'd have never gone to prison
in the first place.

34:37.060 --> 34:38.820
Who are you?

34:38.860 --> 34:40.498
Exactly who I said I am.

34:40.500 --> 34:42.500
Scarlet Finch.

34:42.540 --> 34:44.540
But Lucia used to call me...

34:44.580 --> 34:45.940
her little red bird.

34:51.900 --> 34:54.100
You...

34:54.139 --> 34:55.699
No...

34:55.739 --> 34:56.739
No!

35:01.660 --> 35:05.260
Now, you can either die
the same way as Lucia...

35:05.300 --> 35:08.700
or be poisoned like Mildred.

35:08.740 --> 35:10.340
Your choice...

35:12.500 --> 35:17.260
Stop! Stay back.
Scarlet, don't do this.

35:17.300 --> 35:18.740
You don't understand.

35:18.780 --> 35:21.180
I know that Cardinal Vogel
is based on you.

35:21.220 --> 35:24.340
She paid me to be her plaything.

35:24.380 --> 35:27.580
In the novel,
he sets fire to the palace.

35:27.620 --> 35:30.020
I didn't burn down Lucia's mansion!

35:30.060 --> 35:31.860
But they blamed you.

35:31.900 --> 35:33.860
They shouldn't have
sent you to prison.

35:33.900 --> 35:36.299
Lucia started the fire
while she was drunk...

35:36.300 --> 35:38.579
then framed me. Three people died.

35:38.580 --> 35:41.460
Ten years, I got.
Lucia ruined my life.

35:41.500 --> 35:44.060
So then you came back here
with Mildred

35:44.100 --> 35:46.860
and then you went alone
to Lucia's place...

35:48.580 --> 35:51.980
..and you killed her
and cut off her hand.

35:54.660 --> 35:57.499
But why threaten Lady Ursula?

35:57.500 --> 36:00.579
I gave Lucia a false alibi.

36:00.580 --> 36:02.540
It put her in the clear!

36:02.580 --> 36:05.459
Everyone believed Lucia when
she pointed the finger at me.

36:05.460 --> 36:07.620
I'm sorry.

36:07.660 --> 36:10.660
I've never stopped thinking
about what I did to you.

36:10.700 --> 36:13.300
That's why I started
the prisoner charity.

36:13.340 --> 36:15.340
To make you feel better?

36:15.380 --> 36:18.740
You could have come forward
any time over the years.

36:18.780 --> 36:21.059
Now swallow them. Scarlet.

36:21.060 --> 36:22.459
Get out of my way, Father.

36:22.460 --> 36:24.020
I can't do that.

36:26.300 --> 36:27.500
She's a victim too.

36:30.820 --> 36:32.580
Lucia used you both.

36:32.620 --> 36:34.459
She could have said no.

36:34.460 --> 36:35.860
She had a choice.

36:35.900 --> 36:37.460
And so can you now.

36:37.500 --> 36:39.539
I won't tell you again, Father.

36:39.540 --> 36:40.940
Move.

36:40.980 --> 36:43.140
Lucia turned you into a killer...

36:45.020 --> 36:46.820
..but that's not who you truly are.

36:49.260 --> 36:51.900
How many more are you going to kill?

36:51.940 --> 36:53.020
Bunty?

36:53.060 --> 36:54.340
Me?

36:54.380 --> 36:56.140
Just because we know the truth?

36:58.420 --> 37:00.220
Is that why you killed your friend?

37:03.700 --> 37:05.700
Mildred?

37:05.740 --> 37:07.340
Let me explain.

37:07.380 --> 37:09.179
'I had to stop her from
going to the police.'

37:09.180 --> 37:12.700
How easy has it become
to take another person's life?

37:15.580 --> 37:17.980
Try and remember
the young girl you were

37:18.020 --> 37:19.820
before Lucia warped your mind,

37:19.860 --> 37:21.260
before you went to prison.

37:25.260 --> 37:27.940
Where is that girl?

37:27.980 --> 37:29.340
Where is that goodness?

37:31.380 --> 37:32.380
Where's her faith?

37:36.900 --> 37:38.420
God will forgive you.

37:41.180 --> 37:42.500
God still loves you.

37:46.340 --> 37:47.580
SCARLET SOBS GENTLY

38:05.460 --> 38:06.460
I won't be long.

38:08.900 --> 38:11.499
Lady Ursula...

38:11.500 --> 38:14.139
What have I done?

38:14.140 --> 38:18.299
No. You weren't to know
any of this would happen.

38:18.300 --> 38:21.380
I thought I could live with my past.
ENGINE STARTS

38:21.420 --> 38:24.059
What a fool.

38:24.060 --> 38:26.099
You're a different person now.

38:26.100 --> 38:27.779
Am I?

38:27.780 --> 38:31.020
Or am I just deluding myself.

38:36.420 --> 38:39.340
Oh...
Everyone is worthy of forgiveness.

38:42.220 --> 38:45.340
I'm not religious, Father, but...

38:45.380 --> 38:48.499
I know God cast Satan into Hell

38:48.500 --> 38:50.940
because there was
no redemption for him.

38:52.380 --> 38:54.580
It's the same for me.

38:54.620 --> 38:56.140
Do you honestly believe that?

38:58.700 --> 39:00.220
I can't hide it any more.

39:02.980 --> 39:06.580
I got immense pleasure
from hurting people,

39:06.620 --> 39:07.740
wrecking their lives.

39:09.380 --> 39:11.259
Lucia...

39:11.260 --> 39:13.260
tapped into something and...

39:14.900 --> 39:17.140
..I couldn't resist.

39:17.180 --> 39:18.180
And now?

39:19.620 --> 39:22.020
Not a day passes when I don't feel

39:22.060 --> 39:25.740
the conflict of
good and bad inside me.

39:27.900 --> 39:29.579
Mm.

39:29.580 --> 39:31.860
Then unburden yourself.

39:33.020 --> 39:34.780
Tell the police everything.

39:36.260 --> 39:38.740
You'll have to do that for me,
Father.

39:40.220 --> 39:41.220
Why?

39:42.380 --> 39:43.820
Told you.

39:45.380 --> 39:47.420
Can't live with it any longer.

39:51.300 --> 39:52.300
Poison?

39:54.340 --> 39:55.659
I knew...

39:55.660 --> 39:57.819
one day...

39:57.820 --> 39:59.140
it would become...

40:00.620 --> 40:01.900
..unbearable.

40:04.700 --> 40:06.700
This day...

40:09.820 --> 40:10.940
I need help here!

40:27.020 --> 40:28.220
THUNDER RUMBLES

40:40.460 --> 40:41.820
James.

40:41.860 --> 40:43.660
Father.

40:43.700 --> 40:46.380
Just waiting for the friar.
They're releasing him.

40:46.420 --> 40:47.540
Good.

40:49.820 --> 40:50.980
And how are you?

40:54.700 --> 40:57.460
I still can't believe
she could do such a thing.

40:57.500 --> 40:59.939
Then again,
she never confided in me.

40:59.940 --> 41:01.940
Cared more about helping others.

41:01.980 --> 41:05.420
Her charity work was
her way of making amends.

41:05.460 --> 41:07.060
But she did care about you.

41:08.460 --> 41:11.740
I've never understood
why you've always defended her.

41:13.700 --> 41:16.940
Now she's gone,
perhaps you should tell him.

41:27.380 --> 41:29.580
I left the order because...

41:29.620 --> 41:31.580
because I fathered a child. A boy.

41:37.740 --> 41:39.819
I thought my father died in the war.

41:39.820 --> 41:42.499
Your mother insisted
on keeping it a secret.

41:42.500 --> 41:45.700
She wouldn't let me
live in the house.

41:45.740 --> 41:47.020
But...

41:47.060 --> 41:48.500
I wanted to stay close.

41:50.140 --> 41:51.900
Don't.

41:51.940 --> 41:53.300
James...

41:54.620 --> 41:56.780
It will take time.

42:00.700 --> 42:02.100
James...

42:03.740 --> 42:06.100
Yet another secret of my mother's.

42:07.220 --> 42:09.460
She was only thinking about you.

42:09.500 --> 42:13.260
Deep down, she was a good person.

42:13.300 --> 42:16.300
How can you say that after all
the horrible things she did?

42:16.340 --> 42:19.059
Lucia was very controlling.

42:19.060 --> 42:20.740
She...

42:22.540 --> 42:25.299
She was a vile, poisonous individual

42:25.300 --> 42:27.660
and the world is better off
without her.

42:32.380 --> 42:34.139
Well, it was all in there.

42:34.140 --> 42:36.500
I'm surprised we didn't
work it out earlier.

42:36.540 --> 42:37.899
Now that it's over,

42:37.900 --> 42:40.500
can we throw that filth away?

42:42.060 --> 42:44.339
Mrs McCarthy...!

42:44.340 --> 42:45.779
Well...

42:45.780 --> 42:48.739
I have no idea how that got there.

42:48.740 --> 42:50.779
Unless it was you!

42:50.780 --> 42:53.660
A lady would never
do such a thing.

42:53.700 --> 42:54.900
Exactly!

42:58.260 --> 43:01.819
She's probably got a copy
stuffed under her mattress.

43:01.820 --> 43:02.820
Toodle-pip!
