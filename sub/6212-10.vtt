WEBVTT

00:02.202 --> 00:04.271
"Happy Holidays
from the York Family."

00:04.271 --> 00:06.607
Roxie:
More like the Dork Family.

00:06.607 --> 00:07.975
What's it about Christmas
that makes people

00:07.975 --> 00:09.710
want to wear
matching outfits?

00:09.710 --> 00:11.445
The Yorks dress alike
for every holiday.

00:11.445 --> 00:14.014
Last St. Patrick's Day
they were all leprechauns--

00:14.014 --> 00:16.517
cute on the baby, disturbing
on everyone else.

00:16.517 --> 00:17.818
Speaking
of disturbing...

00:17.818 --> 00:20.387
Josh can't come home
with me for Christmas.

00:20.387 --> 00:22.689
His family is dragging him
to Aruba

00:22.689 --> 00:25.759
to stay at some five-star resort
on the beach.

00:25.759 --> 00:30.397
Poor thing, he'll be pining
for me all week.

00:31.265 --> 00:33.667
Well, time for another
joyous, uplifting Hanukah

00:33.667 --> 00:34.835
with my family.

00:34.835 --> 00:36.436
Ooh, I almost forgot
my antacid.

00:36.436 --> 00:38.238
I've never been
to a Hanukah celebration.

00:38.238 --> 00:39.406
What does your family do?

00:39.406 --> 00:41.608
We light candles,
spin the dreidel

00:41.608 --> 00:44.545
and then 12 people
attack a helpless brisket.

00:44.545 --> 00:48.248
Better take
the Imodium A-D.

00:49.349 --> 00:51.018
Well, I'm off to my parents'...

00:51.018 --> 00:53.220
unless I'm abducted
by aliens on the way--

00:53.220 --> 00:55.489
God willing.

00:56.089 --> 00:58.225
So, Roxie, what's
your family doing
for Christmas?

00:58.225 --> 01:00.193
The usual--
we put up an aluminum tree

01:00.193 --> 01:01.562
get takeout from Taco Bell

01:01.562 --> 01:03.330
and then I watch
my Dad and Stepmom

01:03.330 --> 01:05.132
exchange cartons
of Winston Lights.

01:05.132 --> 01:07.367
Your family exchanges
cigarettes?

01:07.367 --> 01:09.269
Hey, it's just
not Christmas

01:09.269 --> 01:12.806
without a visit from
jolly old St. Nicotine.

01:12.973 --> 01:15.075
Oh, I guess
I should feel thankful.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.910
Next to these guys

01:16.910 --> 01:19.413
Christmas with my family
seems so normal.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.148
I wish mine did.

01:21.148 --> 01:22.883
Just once I'd like to have

01:22.883 --> 01:25.185
the perfect white Christmas
in the country--

01:25.185 --> 01:27.888
ski chalet in Vermont,
sleigh rides, roasted goose

01:27.888 --> 01:29.389
cutting down your own tree.

01:29.389 --> 01:31.124
Throw in some
homemade pfeffernuss

01:31.124 --> 01:33.627
and you just described
Christmas with my family.

01:33.627 --> 01:37.698
Wow, nothing says "Christmas"
like goose and pfeffernuss.

01:37.864 --> 01:39.299
Hey, why don't you
come with me?

01:39.299 --> 01:41.435
Oh, it would be so great
to have a friend along.

01:41.435 --> 01:42.769
Oh, I'd love to,
but I can't.

01:42.769 --> 01:44.438
I always spend Christmas
with my aunts

01:44.438 --> 01:45.973
and this year
it's our turn to host

01:45.973 --> 01:47.808
a huge celebration
for all our relatives.

01:47.808 --> 01:49.443
That sounds
like a lot of fun, too.

01:49.443 --> 01:52.679
"Fun," "insane"-- it's such
a fine line in my house.

01:52.679 --> 01:55.048
Well, if you change your mind
about Vermont

01:55.048 --> 01:57.284
you're always welcome.

02:01.188 --> 02:03.757
Merry Christmas, Sabrina!

02:03.757 --> 02:05.559
We can't wait to see you
at your house.

02:05.559 --> 02:07.094
Love, Uncle Olaf
and Aunt Dottie.

02:07.094 --> 02:08.428
( <i>chuckles</i> )

02:08.428 --> 02:11.064
Care for a
sneak preview of
my blubber mold?

02:11.064 --> 02:12.666
Oh, no, thanks.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.901
I want to have something
to look forward to.

02:14.901 --> 02:16.937
Ooh, blubber.

02:20.273 --> 02:26.747
♪ Life's changing around me,
and I'm gonna make it mine ♪

02:26.747 --> 02:33.286
♪ I'm reaching out
and living by my rules... ♪

02:33.286 --> 02:36.456
♪ Time's moving way too fast ♪

02:36.456 --> 02:40.227
♪ I wanna make it last... ♪

02:42.629 --> 02:46.133

02:46.133 --> 02:50.237

02:58.245 --> 03:01.081
Taste this.

03:01.081 --> 03:01.581
Mmm...

03:01.581 --> 03:03.483
Eggy and nutmeggy

03:03.483 --> 03:05.719
with a slight aftertaste
of... wart?

03:05.719 --> 03:06.920
It's legnog.

03:06.920 --> 03:07.954
The secret is to use

03:07.954 --> 03:09.690
fresh gremlin legs--
never frozen.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.725
No, the secret is to ask
what's on the spoon

03:11.725 --> 03:13.493
before I let you
stick it in my mouth.

03:13.493 --> 03:15.796
I think I've finally got
our sleeping arrangements

03:15.796 --> 03:16.997
while our guests
are here.

03:16.997 --> 03:18.465
Hilda, you'll be
bunking with me

03:18.465 --> 03:20.434
and Salem, you're sleeping
under the stairs

03:20.434 --> 03:21.935
with Cousin Ira.

03:21.935 --> 03:24.604
Anybody but
that creepy little elf.

03:24.604 --> 03:26.306
What do you have
against Ira?

03:26.306 --> 03:29.009
A) He stabs me
with his pointy ears

03:29.009 --> 03:32.846
and B) he likes to watch me
when I clean myself.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.715
All:
Ew!

03:34.715 --> 03:35.949
Mm-hmm.

03:35.949 --> 03:37.117
Sabrina,
you'll double up

03:37.117 --> 03:38.452
with the Sugar
Plum Fairy.

03:38.452 --> 03:39.853
Just what I need:

03:39.853 --> 03:41.588
a twinkle toes
and a sugar rush

03:41.588 --> 03:43.090
who grinds her
teeth all night.

03:43.090 --> 03:45.659
Hey, now, this
is no time to be
a gloomy Gus.

03:45.659 --> 03:47.027
The holidays
are upon us.

03:47.027 --> 03:49.396
We're going to have
a wonderful Christmas.

03:49.396 --> 03:53.834
Yeah, a wonderful Christmas.

03:53.834 --> 03:57.137
♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way ♪

03:57.137 --> 04:01.708
♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride in
a one-horse open sleigh, hey! ♪

04:01.708 --> 04:03.376
Morgan, look, baby deer.

04:03.376 --> 04:05.612
Oh, they're so cute.

04:05.612 --> 04:07.814
This is what I call
the perfect Christmas.

04:07.814 --> 04:12.285
And this is what I call
the perfect Christmas presents.

04:12.285 --> 04:14.054
Hello, ladies.

04:14.054 --> 04:15.689
Oh, apparently,
Santa got my list.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.524
We'll see you
on the slopes tomorrow

04:17.524 --> 04:18.825
right after we have

04:18.825 --> 04:20.861
our perfect
Christmas dinner

04:20.861 --> 04:23.530
with roast goose,
cranberry stuffing

04:23.530 --> 04:24.698
and eggnog.

04:24.698 --> 04:27.267
Whoo-hoo! I love eggnog.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.668
Hilda:
It's "legnog"--
try it again.

04:28.668 --> 04:30.203
I added a soupcon
of webbed feet.

04:30.203 --> 04:31.872
Oh, Aunt Hilda,
Aunt Zelda...

04:31.872 --> 04:33.673
would you guys mind
if I wasn't here

04:33.673 --> 04:35.008
for Christmas
this year?

04:35.008 --> 04:36.977
Dibs on bunking with the fairy!

04:36.977 --> 04:38.979
Sabrina, what are
you talking about?

04:38.979 --> 04:41.047
Morgan's family invited me
to go skiing with them.

04:41.047 --> 04:43.250
As much as I'd miss you guys,
I'd really like to go.

04:43.250 --> 04:44.851
Well, Sabrina,
if you want to be

04:44.851 --> 04:47.521
with Morgan's family
at Christmas,
we'll understand.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.022
We will?

04:49.022 --> 04:50.390
Well, Sabrina
shouldn't be here

04:50.390 --> 04:51.892
just because
she feels obligated.

04:51.892 --> 04:53.093
She shouldn't?

04:53.093 --> 04:54.494
That's why we're here.

04:54.494 --> 04:56.830
Thanks, Aunt Zelda.
I knew you'd understand.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.165
I got to go call Morgan.

04:58.165 --> 05:00.233
I can't
believe Sabrina

05:00.233 --> 05:02.769
doesn't want to be
with family at Christmas!

05:02.769 --> 05:05.372
Well, she's in college now,
meeting new friends.

05:05.372 --> 05:08.175
She doesn't want to be
with her boring, old aunties

05:08.175 --> 05:12.045
when she could be off
shushing down the slopes.

05:12.045 --> 05:13.480
I say our little Sabrini

05:13.480 --> 05:16.049
has forgotten
the true meaning of Christmas

05:16.049 --> 05:20.120
which reminds me, this year
I'd like sturgeon and cash.

05:20.554 --> 05:22.155
Welcome to
a Cavanaugh Christmas.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.690
We're here!

05:23.690 --> 05:24.991
Wow, it's
even more perfect

05:24.991 --> 05:26.426
than I pictured!

05:26.426 --> 05:28.128
You wouldn't have
cute baby deer

05:28.128 --> 05:29.529
running around, would you?

05:29.529 --> 05:30.564
Hi!

05:30.564 --> 05:31.698
Hi!

05:31.698 --> 05:33.133
Even better.

05:33.133 --> 05:34.601
I'm Morgan's
brother, Chip.

05:34.601 --> 05:36.036
This is Sabrina.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.704
Hello!
Hi!

05:37.704 --> 05:38.705
My Mom and Dad.

05:38.705 --> 05:39.906
-Hi.
-Hi.

05:39.906 --> 05:41.408
Wow, it's great to meet you.

05:41.408 --> 05:43.677
I hope you
don't mind me
tagging along with Morgan.

05:43.677 --> 05:46.413
I mean, she just made
your Christmas sound so perfect.

05:46.413 --> 05:46.778
Well, it will be

05:46.778 --> 05:48.181
now that you're
joining us.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.150
How about a cup
of mulled cider to warm you up?

05:50.150 --> 05:51.585
Thanks-- you don't by any chance

05:51.585 --> 05:53.687
have those little cinnamon
thingees to stir it?

05:53.687 --> 05:55.622
What do you think?

05:55.622 --> 05:56.923
Sabrina, make
yourself at home.

05:56.923 --> 05:58.625
If there's
anything you need,
just holler.

05:58.625 --> 05:59.960
I wouldn't want to do that--

05:59.960 --> 06:01.761
might wake
myself up.

06:01.761 --> 06:03.029
If anybody's interested

06:03.029 --> 06:04.798
I've got the tree
all ready to decorate.

06:04.798 --> 06:06.099
Oh, or maybe
you'd like to do

06:06.099 --> 06:08.268
something more relaxing
like roast chestnuts...?

06:08.268 --> 06:09.603
On an open fire...

06:09.603 --> 06:11.171
with Jack Frost nipping
at my nose?

06:11.171 --> 06:12.205
Pace yourself.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.273
You don't
want to peak

06:13.273 --> 06:14.441
before we
deck the halls.

06:14.441 --> 06:15.442
Dad:
Hey, Chip.

06:15.442 --> 06:16.843
Why don't you
help the girls

06:16.843 --> 06:17.878
with their luggage?

06:17.878 --> 06:18.912
With pleasure.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.280
Come on.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.849
Oh, it doesn't get
any better than this.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.655
Wow, it does get
even better.

06:28.655 --> 06:29.990
See you downstairs.

06:29.990 --> 06:30.991
I'd like that.

06:30.991 --> 06:32.792
I mean, uh...
yeah, sure.

06:33.326 --> 06:34.961
You can put your clothes
in the closet

06:34.961 --> 06:36.363
and the bathroom's
through there.

06:36.363 --> 06:38.331
Come on, I want to show you
the view from my room.

06:38.732 --> 06:39.900
Your brother's really cute.

06:39.900 --> 06:40.901
Is he dating anybody?

06:40.901 --> 06:42.402
No... for some reason

06:42.402 --> 06:45.405
he just can't seem
to find the right girl.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.575
Oh, maybe the right girl
just needs to find him.

06:53.346 --> 06:56.016
( <i>grunting</i> )

06:56.016 --> 06:58.051
It's been a long ride.

06:58.051 --> 07:00.120
I need to freshen up.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.956
I still say if we
had tied a tether
to Sabrina's back

07:02.956 --> 07:05.258
she couldn't
have abandoned
us at Christmas

07:05.258 --> 07:07.727
and we could have had
a vigorous game of tether ball.

07:07.727 --> 07:09.362
Christmas won't be
the same without her.

07:09.362 --> 07:11.464
We'll have to reconfigure
the seating arrangements.

07:11.464 --> 07:14.034
Just don't put
Blitzen near the
liquor cabinet.

07:14.034 --> 07:16.169
They don't call him
that for nothing.

07:16.169 --> 07:18.305
You know, I can't
find the dish I use

07:18.305 --> 07:19.572
for my emu casserole.

07:19.572 --> 07:20.907
I lent it
to Sabrina.

07:20.907 --> 07:22.676
I'll go get it.

07:22.676 --> 07:24.511
Even though the last thing
I want to do

07:24.511 --> 07:26.846
is get stuck
in the holiday rush.

07:26.846 --> 07:28.648
Oh... it's madness out there.

07:28.648 --> 07:30.550
All right, where is that dish?

07:30.550 --> 07:31.718
( <i>clattering</i> )

07:31.718 --> 07:35.388
Whoever you are, I'm warning
you, I have a black belt!

07:35.388 --> 07:36.423
Roxie?

07:36.423 --> 07:37.590
Okay, it's charcoal

07:37.590 --> 07:38.992
but it goes with the shoes.

07:38.992 --> 07:40.460
Hilda, what
are you doing here?

07:40.460 --> 07:41.828
And what's
with your hair?

07:41.828 --> 07:44.164
A better question is:
What are <i>you</i> doing here?

07:44.164 --> 07:46.099
Sabrina said you
were at home enjoying

07:46.099 --> 07:48.335
a delightful Christmas
involving cigarettes.

07:48.335 --> 07:49.803
I lied. I'm not going.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.471
Well, Roxie,
don't you want

07:51.471 --> 07:53.807
to spend Christmas
with your family?

07:53.807 --> 07:55.141
And eat
lukewarm chalupas

07:55.141 --> 07:57.177
while listening
to my parents
cough up a lung?

07:57.177 --> 07:58.645
Pass.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.180
Well, you can't
spend Christmas

08:00.180 --> 08:01.548
sitting here
all by yourself.

08:01.548 --> 08:03.083
I'll be fine.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.352
I don't want anyone
feeling sorry for me...

08:05.352 --> 08:06.820
Oh, you poor,
pathetic dear.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.054
Like that.

08:16.796 --> 08:20.333
Oh, if only I could
freeze this moment.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.668
Actually, I can, but that
would be kind of creepy.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.036
Mom:
Oh, Sabrina
would you

08:23.036 --> 08:24.637
like to help me
with the cookies?

08:24.637 --> 08:25.638
I can use a hand.

08:25.638 --> 08:26.639
And I've got two.

08:26.639 --> 08:27.640
Baking cookies
at Christmas time

08:27.640 --> 08:30.010
is one of my
favorite things to do.

08:30.010 --> 08:30.643
Well, isn't that nice?

08:30.643 --> 08:31.578
Of course, you're
not expected

08:31.578 --> 08:34.881
to stay in the kitchen
365 days a year...

08:34.881 --> 08:36.616
like a dutiful wife

08:36.616 --> 08:38.852
trapped behind
her apron!

08:38.852 --> 08:39.953
Uh, maybe
I'll just go see

08:39.953 --> 08:41.821
how Chip's doing
with those lights.

08:44.924 --> 08:45.959
Hey, need any help?

08:45.959 --> 08:47.527
Another one of
my favorite things

08:47.527 --> 08:50.830
to do at Christmas time
is untangle lights.

08:50.830 --> 08:52.732
Knock yourself out.

08:52.732 --> 08:54.067
Uh, so, uh...

08:54.067 --> 08:56.102
Morgan tells me
that you're pre-med
at Harvard.

08:56.102 --> 08:57.404
That's great.

08:57.404 --> 08:59.205
The truth is,
I dropped out
two years ago

08:59.205 --> 09:00.607
but I haven't
told my parents

09:00.607 --> 09:02.642
because I want those
checks to keep coming.

09:02.642 --> 09:03.843
Keep that
under your hat.

09:03.843 --> 09:06.446
No problem, as long as you
promise not to do anything

09:06.446 --> 09:08.048
ending in "-ectomy"
or "-urgery."

09:08.048 --> 09:09.916
Hey, you want to know
another secret?

09:09.916 --> 09:11.151
No. One's
enough for me.

09:11.151 --> 09:12.419
So, can I do anything?

09:12.419 --> 09:16.423
Stupid thing
won't light!

09:16.423 --> 09:17.524
Mom:
I'll tell you
what you could do.

09:17.524 --> 09:18.591
You can show iron-
deficient John over here

09:18.591 --> 09:20.393
how to split a log.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.195
Any idiot knows
you have to split a log

09:22.195 --> 09:23.263
if you want it to burn.

09:23.263 --> 09:24.864
Oh, I'll burn something for you.

09:24.864 --> 09:27.434
I'll burn this whole
house to the ground!

09:27.434 --> 09:29.936
Note to self: Check smoke
detector in my bedroom.

09:33.106 --> 09:37.844
Okay, I just have to go
talk to Zelda for a quick
minute-- stay, sit.

09:37.844 --> 09:39.079
I'm not a dog.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.681
I know-- I just don't
want you to run away...

09:41.681 --> 09:42.916
or chew anything up.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.385
"Line pan with emu mixture

09:45.385 --> 09:51.391
then top with cream of mushroom
soup and Durkee's Fried Onions."

09:51.391 --> 09:52.659
Hi.

09:52.659 --> 09:54.661
Hi. Oh, good, you brought
the casserole dish.

09:54.661 --> 09:56.262
That's not the only
thing I brought.

09:56.262 --> 09:58.498
I found Roxie hiding out
at Sabrina's house

09:58.498 --> 10:00.867
so I invited her
to spend Christmas
with us.

10:00.867 --> 10:02.635
What?! Are you mad?

10:02.635 --> 10:03.803
We have relatives coming

10:03.803 --> 10:05.271
from the other realm.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.240
And a poor, pathetic
girl from this realm

10:07.240 --> 10:09.008
who has nowhere
to go on Christmas.

10:09.008 --> 10:10.710
She's sitting out
there like a dog.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.011
You know what?

10:12.011 --> 10:13.313
We could tell
the relatives

10:13.313 --> 10:15.181
to move
the celebration
to Aunt Ruby's

10:15.181 --> 10:16.649
and you and I
could give Roxie

10:16.649 --> 10:18.218
a traditional,
mortal Christmas.

10:18.218 --> 10:22.655
Great... now we just have
to figure out what that is.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.190
Wow,
it's beautiful!

10:24.190 --> 10:26.192
Except for that
one crooked icicle--

10:26.192 --> 10:27.794
courtesy of my
inept husband.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.929
There, now it's perfect.

10:29.929 --> 10:31.865
Thanks, Sabrina.

10:31.865 --> 10:34.167
Look, I know my family's
a little nuts.

10:34.167 --> 10:35.301
Don't worry about it.

10:35.301 --> 10:36.903
You want to see
an assortment of nuts

10:36.903 --> 10:37.904
come over to my house.

10:37.904 --> 10:39.839
That's it.

10:39.839 --> 10:41.508
Why does your dad
have the extinguisher?

10:41.508 --> 10:44.611
All right, you whiny
bunch of choirboys!

10:44.611 --> 10:47.580
I'll give you
a real "Silent Night"!

10:48.615 --> 10:50.183
Okay, your family wins
first prize

10:50.183 --> 10:51.217
in the crazy contest.

10:51.217 --> 10:52.685
Well, your father's
at it again.

10:52.685 --> 10:54.020
Early New Year's
resolution--

10:54.020 --> 10:56.289
have him committed!

10:56.289 --> 10:57.891
Oh, will you excuse me?

10:57.891 --> 11:00.960
It's usually my job
to calm down the police.

11:03.429 --> 11:07.066
Okay, this is officially <i>not</i>
the perfect Christmas.

11:07.066 --> 11:08.535
Salem:
Bah humbug!

11:08.535 --> 11:10.436
Salem, what are you doing here?

11:10.436 --> 11:13.806
I couldn't stand the thought
of Cousin Ira staring at me

11:13.806 --> 11:15.842
so I stowed away
in your suitcase.

11:15.842 --> 11:17.277
By the by, you might want

11:17.277 --> 11:19.879
to run a lint brush
over your unmentionables.

11:19.879 --> 11:21.147
Salem, you can't stay here.

11:21.147 --> 11:22.148
You weren't invited.

11:22.148 --> 11:24.317
Nobody invited the wise man.

11:24.317 --> 11:25.485
( <i>gasps</i> )

11:25.485 --> 11:26.953
Rum balls!

11:26.953 --> 11:28.288
You're so out of here.

11:28.288 --> 11:29.389
Hey...

11:29.389 --> 11:31.057
where did the cat
come from?

11:31.057 --> 11:33.059
Oh, he's mine.
I'm sorry.

11:33.059 --> 11:34.527
He, uh, stowed away.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.629
I mean, he accidentally ended up
in my luggage.

11:36.629 --> 11:38.364
Don't worry,
I'm sending him home now.

11:38.364 --> 11:39.365
But it's
over 200 miles

11:39.365 --> 11:40.567
and it's freezing
out there.

11:40.567 --> 11:41.701
Oh, he'll be fine.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.269
Didn't you see
<i>The Incredible Journey?</i>

11:43.269 --> 11:45.004
Animals do that kind
of thing all the time.

11:45.004 --> 11:46.506
Let him stay.
I love cats.

11:46.506 --> 11:48.508
But what about
the rest of your family?

11:48.508 --> 11:50.877
I mean, your father can
barely tolerate the carolers

11:50.877 --> 11:53.413
let alone...

11:53.413 --> 11:57.050
Chip?

11:57.050 --> 11:59.052
Dude?

11:59.052 --> 12:02.121
These are all foods mortals love
at Christmas time.

12:02.121 --> 12:04.724
Candy cane, fruitcake
and eggnog.

12:04.724 --> 12:07.260
I still don't know why
they leave out the leg.

12:07.260 --> 12:08.595
That's what gives it
the kick.

12:11.564 --> 12:15.501
Roxie, here's your tray of
traditional Christmas goodies.

12:15.501 --> 12:16.502
For me?

12:16.502 --> 12:17.503
Thanks.

12:17.503 --> 12:19.138
They smell great.

12:19.138 --> 12:20.473
Fabulous recipe--

12:20.473 --> 12:22.308
got it from
<i>Mortal Christmas</i>
<i>for Dummies.</i>

12:22.308 --> 12:23.543
"Mortal Christmas"?

12:23.543 --> 12:24.844
"More till Christmas"

12:24.844 --> 12:26.646
and even more
till New Year's.

12:26.646 --> 12:28.514
Better take
your tray upstairs.

12:28.514 --> 12:31.351
You don't want to be awake
when Santa arrives.

12:31.351 --> 12:32.819
Wouldn't want to do that.

12:32.819 --> 12:35.221
You guys are so cute!

12:38.324 --> 12:40.126
Well, unless we want
to be up all night

12:40.126 --> 12:42.528
we'd better get those
presents under the tree.

12:44.697 --> 12:46.432
Whew, I'm exhausted.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.434
Thank goodness,
Christmas comes
just once a year.

12:48.434 --> 12:49.936
Mm-hmm.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.104
What a nightmare.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.305
If I wanted to
see a freak show

12:52.305 --> 12:53.773
I would have
stayed at home.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.208
I'll give you a nightmare:

12:55.208 --> 12:56.876
A full-grown man
staring at you

12:56.876 --> 12:58.678
for three hours
without blinking.

12:58.678 --> 13:01.547
Still, it's got
to be crazier back
at my aunt's house.

13:02.548 --> 13:04.550
♪ Deck the halls
with boughs of holly ♪

13:04.550 --> 13:05.985
♪ Fa la la la la la la la... ♪

13:05.985 --> 13:07.086
Where is everybody?

13:07.086 --> 13:08.755
There are no
drunken reindeer

13:08.755 --> 13:10.823
no... no... no
hypoglycemic fairies.

13:10.823 --> 13:12.158
No Cousin Ira!

13:12.158 --> 13:13.159
( <i>exasperated sigh</i> )

13:13.159 --> 13:14.160
I can't believe it.

13:14.160 --> 13:15.662
The one year
I decide to go away

13:15.662 --> 13:17.664
and they have a perfect,
normal Christmas.

13:17.664 --> 13:19.632
Let's blow this loony log cabin.

13:19.632 --> 13:20.967
But Morgan invited me.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.635
What excuse will I give her?

13:22.635 --> 13:23.903
We hated here.

13:23.903 --> 13:25.538
You write the note, I'll pack.

13:25.538 --> 13:26.773
Got it.

13:26.773 --> 13:29.909
( <i>knock at door</i> )

13:29.909 --> 13:33.279
Hey, Sabrina, I just
wanted to apologize
for my family.

13:33.279 --> 13:34.447
Oh, no need.

13:34.447 --> 13:37.417
You know, your family's...
no need.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.285
I thought that if I
brought a friend up here

13:39.285 --> 13:40.920
they might actually
behave themselves.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.955
Apparently,
I was... mistaken.

13:42.955 --> 13:45.325
Morgan, you won't
have to worry about
that much longer.

13:45.325 --> 13:48.928
I know, I know-- Christmas
will be over tomorrow night.

13:48.928 --> 13:51.164
Thank you for putting up
with all this.

13:51.164 --> 13:54.400
There is no way that
I could get through
the next 24 hours

13:54.400 --> 13:56.969
without a good friend like you.

14:01.808 --> 14:03.743
Well, good night.

14:03.743 --> 14:05.011
Good night.

14:06.746 --> 14:07.847
( <i>door closes</i> )

14:07.847 --> 14:09.248
You'd better start bathing now.

14:09.248 --> 14:11.017
I hear that Chip wakes up
really early.

14:11.017 --> 14:13.953
( <i>groans</i> )

14:19.325 --> 14:20.526
Merry Christmas, Hilda.

14:20.526 --> 14:23.029
Merry Christmas, Zelda.

14:23.029 --> 14:23.596
Listen to us.

14:23.596 --> 14:24.864
Both:
We sound like mortals.

14:24.864 --> 14:25.832
( <i>giggling</i> )

14:26.499 --> 14:27.734
Merry Christmas, Roxie.

14:27.734 --> 14:29.202
Merry Christmas, Roxie.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.603
Merry Christmas.

14:30.603 --> 14:33.172
Wow, I guess Santa
did show up last night.

14:33.172 --> 14:36.075
Yep, and he brought you <i>all</i>
<i>these presents.</i>

14:36.075 --> 14:37.710
Really?

14:37.710 --> 14:38.845
Well, except for that one.

14:38.845 --> 14:39.946
That one's for me.

14:39.946 --> 14:41.814
No, I'm kidding--
they're all for you.

14:41.814 --> 14:43.883
I could definitely get
into this holiday.

14:47.286 --> 14:49.188
Thank you,
Sabrina.

14:49.188 --> 14:50.590
Oh, this is
so pretty.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.058
Well, you're always
borrowing mine

14:52.058 --> 14:53.893
so I bought you
your own.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.962
Then I guess I should
give you yours back.

14:56.129 --> 14:59.665
Uh, Mom, open
the present I got you.

14:59.665 --> 15:01.234
If you're not too looped
on the rum balls.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.770
Only way to survive
Christmas with you.

15:03.770 --> 15:04.170
I hope you like it.

15:04.170 --> 15:06.572
I think it'll look
really good on you.

15:06.572 --> 15:10.510
Oh, well, this...
not exactly my color.

15:10.510 --> 15:11.711
Ooh, that fabric
is itchy, wow.

15:11.711 --> 15:13.279
Doesn't matter-- all
she ever wears to bed

15:13.279 --> 15:14.614
is sweat suits, anyway.

15:14.614 --> 15:16.482
And she's still
cold as ice.

15:16.482 --> 15:18.384
Well, I think it'll look
beautiful on you Mrs.Cavana

15:18.384 --> 15:21.921
What do you think, Chip?

15:21.921 --> 15:23.356
What is he staring at?

15:23.356 --> 15:25.725
I'm not doing anything.

15:25.725 --> 15:27.293
That guy's wacko.

15:27.293 --> 15:28.694
Where are you going,
little kitty?

15:28.694 --> 15:29.595
Uh, Dad?

15:29.595 --> 15:30.563
Yeah.

15:30.563 --> 15:32.198
This is from me.

15:32.198 --> 15:35.501
I think it's something
that you'll really enjoy.

15:35.501 --> 15:36.569
Ooh, I hope it's
a log-splitter.

15:36.569 --> 15:38.371
Or, better yet,
a real man to split them.

15:38.371 --> 15:39.639
Ha, ha!

15:40.940 --> 15:42.241
Hey!

15:42.241 --> 15:44.477
Wow, a signed Carl
Yastrzemski picture.

15:44.477 --> 15:45.578
That's so cool.

15:45.578 --> 15:47.280
I looked all
over town for it.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.515
I know what a big
Red Sox fan you are.

15:49.515 --> 15:51.484
Doesn't look like
an original signature.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.186
Of course, how would
you know you were
getting ripped off

15:53.186 --> 15:54.787
with a cheap
reproduction?

15:54.787 --> 15:56.355
Boy, they saw you coming.

15:56.856 --> 16:00.393
I guess I can't do
anything right.

16:00.393 --> 16:01.394
Of course you can.

16:01.394 --> 16:02.695
That's a very thoughtful gift

16:02.695 --> 16:04.363
and a very flattering picture
of Yaz.

16:04.363 --> 16:06.833
I hope you kept the receipt.

16:07.467 --> 16:11.404
Why does she do
that every time she
gives me a gift?

16:11.404 --> 16:13.005
Well, it might have
something to do

16:13.005 --> 16:14.474
with the way
you say thank you.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.175
I'm going to go
get some air.

16:16.175 --> 16:17.276
Come on, Salem.

16:17.276 --> 16:19.178
The cat stays here.

16:23.015 --> 16:24.517
Hey.

16:24.517 --> 16:25.885
You okay?

16:25.885 --> 16:26.886
( <i>sighs</i> )

16:26.886 --> 16:28.955
I am <i>such</i> an idiot.

16:28.955 --> 16:32.825
I keep fooling myself
into thinking
that one year

16:32.825 --> 16:36.562
I am actually
going to have
a normal Christmas.

16:36.562 --> 16:39.265
Yeah, well, normal
is relative.

16:39.265 --> 16:41.601
Yeah, too bad
my relatives aren't normal.

16:41.601 --> 16:44.003
Well, they're not
the most appreciative
bunch, but...

16:44.003 --> 16:46.372
well, you know, I
thought the nightgown
was beautiful

16:46.372 --> 16:47.540
and the autographed
picture--

16:47.540 --> 16:49.242
totally awesome.

16:49.242 --> 16:52.545
I should've given
them to you.

16:52.545 --> 16:53.679
( <i>exasperated groan</i> )

16:53.679 --> 16:56.015
No matter
how hard I try

16:56.015 --> 16:59.151
all my parents do
is criticize.

16:59.151 --> 17:00.419
Well,have you ever spoken to
them

17:00.419 --> 17:01.721
about the way
they treat you?

17:01.721 --> 17:04.323
Yeah, like that would
do a lot of good.

17:04.323 --> 17:06.526
You know, Morgan,
I don't mean to butt in

17:06.526 --> 17:08.628
but before you write
this Christmas off

17:08.628 --> 17:09.862
maybe you should
go in there

17:09.862 --> 17:11.097
and tell them
how you feel.

17:11.097 --> 17:12.131
And I'm not just
saying that

17:12.131 --> 17:14.667
because my tongue is
starting to freeze
to my teeth.

17:14.667 --> 17:16.202
What's the worst
that could happen?

17:16.202 --> 17:19.071
Dad could spray me
with the fire extinguisher.

17:19.071 --> 17:20.239
So you're wet
and foamy

17:20.239 --> 17:22.241
but you've started
a dialogue.

17:22.241 --> 17:25.845
Sabrina, I really appreciate
your trying to help

17:25.845 --> 17:28.514
but I just... I want
to get through this

17:28.514 --> 17:29.815
and get out of here

17:29.815 --> 17:32.084
with whatever dignity
I have left.

17:32.084 --> 17:36.122
( <i>squeaking</i> )

17:36.122 --> 17:38.824
You're not
the only one.

17:39.859 --> 17:42.295
<i>Dirges and Funeral Marches</i>
<i>of the Middle Ages?</i>

17:42.295 --> 17:43.930
Tell me it has "Grieg's Elegy"
on it.

17:43.930 --> 17:45.932
The original and
the remastered dance mix.

17:45.932 --> 17:47.366
You guys are the best.

17:47.366 --> 17:48.868
I've got something
for you, too.

17:48.868 --> 17:50.336
Oh, presents for us?

17:50.336 --> 17:51.437
It's nothing,
really.

17:51.437 --> 17:53.272
I didn't have
much time to shop.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.476
Lotto tickets and...

17:57.476 --> 17:59.078
Gatorade.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.746
When I snuck out at midnight

18:00.746 --> 18:02.615
7-Eleven was
the only place open.

18:02.615 --> 18:05.284
I love Gatorade.

18:05.284 --> 18:08.020
I've tried to make
my own, but it's
never smooth.

18:08.020 --> 18:10.256
Perhaps I'm using
the wrong kind of gators.

18:10.489 --> 18:13.092
Hey, you guys don't have to make
a big deal about the gifts.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.493
I... I know they're not much.

18:14.493 --> 18:16.262
It's not the gifts
that are important

18:16.262 --> 18:17.697
it's the thought
behind them.

18:17.697 --> 18:20.766
And you sneaking
into that 7-Eleven
speaks volumes.

18:22.401 --> 18:23.869
Mom:
Oh, no, no, Sabrina.

18:23.869 --> 18:25.771
We can save that.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.139
Why waste money
on gift wrap

18:27.139 --> 18:28.908
when we can use it
again and again?

18:28.908 --> 18:29.976
Oh, I'm starting
to understand

18:29.976 --> 18:32.478
how you're able
to afford this chalet.

18:32.478 --> 18:34.947
Morgan, you find
that receipt for
the Yastrzemski picture?

18:34.947 --> 18:36.282
I didn't keep it.

18:36.282 --> 18:38.150
What do you mean,
you threw it away?

18:38.150 --> 18:41.687
Dad, I thought that
was the one gift you
wouldn't return.

18:41.687 --> 18:43.689
Well, I certainly
can't now.

18:43.689 --> 18:45.558
Morgan, Morgan,
watch it!

18:45.558 --> 18:48.394
You're crinkling
perfectly good
gift wrap.

18:48.394 --> 18:49.729
Oh, great--
you've ruined it.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.864
Oh, give me a break!

18:51.864 --> 18:53.599
It is a piece
of gift wrap.

18:53.599 --> 18:56.602
You've been using it
since 1986.

18:56.602 --> 18:58.437
Morgan, what's
gotten into you?

18:58.437 --> 19:00.873
All you two do
is criticize.

19:00.873 --> 19:02.308
Well, I don't deserve it

19:02.308 --> 19:05.011
and... and... and
I don't have to
take it anymore.

19:05.011 --> 19:07.346
And I finally
realized that

19:07.346 --> 19:10.316
thanks to my good
friend, Sabrina.

19:10.316 --> 19:11.984
Got to go.

19:13.352 --> 19:14.520
Oh, but before I do

19:14.520 --> 19:15.788
I just want to say one thing.

19:15.788 --> 19:16.922
All Morgan is trying to do

19:16.922 --> 19:18.691
is have a nice Christmas
with her family

19:18.691 --> 19:20.126
but you guys treat her terribly

19:20.126 --> 19:22.294
and you don't treat each other
very nicely, either.

19:22.294 --> 19:23.729
If you can't be nice
at Christmas

19:23.729 --> 19:26.032
I don't even want to know
what goes on here at Easter.

19:26.032 --> 19:27.033
Come on, Salem.

19:27.033 --> 19:28.167
We're out of here.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.168
No!

19:29.168 --> 19:31.070
Don't take the cat.

19:31.070 --> 19:33.039
I thought we were having
a nice Christmas.

19:33.039 --> 19:34.173
Well, so did I.

19:34.840 --> 19:37.643
Aunts:
♪ Troll the ancient
yuletide carol ♪

19:37.643 --> 19:41.080
♪ Fa, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la. ♪

19:41.080 --> 19:42.081
Roxie!

19:42.081 --> 19:42.982
You're singing?

19:42.982 --> 19:43.983
No, I'm not.

19:43.983 --> 19:45.584
I was just clearing
my throat.

19:45.584 --> 19:48.454
( <i>clears throat</i> ):
Fa, la, la, la,
la, la... la.

19:48.454 --> 19:49.455
What are you doing here?

19:49.455 --> 19:50.823
I found her hiding
at your house

19:50.823 --> 19:52.692
so I invited
her to spend
Christmas with us.

19:52.692 --> 19:53.826
What are you
doing here?

19:53.826 --> 19:55.227
Yeah, we thought
you were having

19:55.227 --> 19:57.163
the perfect Christmas
with Morgan's family.

19:57.163 --> 19:58.898
Well, perfect is relative

19:58.898 --> 20:01.934
and compared to them,
my relatives are perfect.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.636
We're glad you're
home, honey.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.004
Oh, Merry Christmas,
sweetheart.

20:05.004 --> 20:07.173
I can't believe you'd want
to spend the holidays

20:07.173 --> 20:08.174
anywhere else.

20:08.174 --> 20:09.542
Your aunts knock
themselves out

20:09.542 --> 20:11.677
when it comes
to Christmas.

20:12.511 --> 20:13.846
Blitzen!

20:13.846 --> 20:16.716
Didn't you get my e-mail
about the change of plan?

20:16.716 --> 20:18.117
Wow, a real reindeer.

20:18.117 --> 20:19.518
You guys are amazing.

20:19.518 --> 20:21.620
I'm coming here
again next year.

20:21.620 --> 20:23.956
Yeah, well, if
you're looking for
the perfect Christmas

20:23.956 --> 20:27.059
everything you need is here:
friends, family, reindeer...

20:27.059 --> 20:28.060
Lotto tickets.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.929
Oh! I won.

20:29.929 --> 20:32.064
I'm going to the liquor store
to get my two dollars.

20:32.465 --> 20:34.800
Blitzen, I believe
you know the way.

20:34.800 --> 20:37.002
Don't you just
love Christmas?

20:44.477 --> 20:46.979
Sabrina, your aunts
are so generous.

20:46.979 --> 20:51.517
Yeah, that'll teach me to leave
at Christmas time.

20:51.517 --> 20:53.786
Hey, what's all this?

20:53.786 --> 20:55.588
My mother packed us
a few leftovers.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.289
We have enough potato latkes
and brisket

20:57.289 --> 21:01.527
to clog all the arteries
of everyone in New England.

21:01.527 --> 21:04.163
Sabrina, I just got off
the phone with my dad.

21:04.163 --> 21:05.831
You will be happy to know

21:05.831 --> 21:08.400
that he is <i>not</i>
returning the Yastrzemski
picture, after all.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.770
He decided to put it
on his desk at work.

21:10.770 --> 21:11.771
That's fantastic.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.139
You know,
you really made

21:13.139 --> 21:14.673
an impression
on my family.

21:14.673 --> 21:17.042
In fact, they want
you to come back
next Christmas.

21:17.042 --> 21:19.678
That is <i>so...</i>
not going to happen.

21:19.678 --> 21:21.247
I totally understand.

21:21.247 --> 21:24.116
Oh, but Chip says anytime
you need a cat-sitter...

21:24.116 --> 21:25.651
( <i>yowls</i> )

21:25.651 --> 21:28.654
Also, not going to happen.

21:28.654 --> 21:29.488
Yeah.
