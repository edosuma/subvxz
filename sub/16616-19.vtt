00:01.502 --> 00:04.755
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

00:04.838 --> 00:08.217
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.300 --> 00:11.803
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>good old-fashioned values</i>

00:11.887 --> 00:14.515
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:15.015 --> 00:17.851
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.352 --> 00:21.563
<i>Lucky there's a man who</i>
<i>positively can do</i>

00:21.647 --> 00:23.148
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.273 --> 00:24.775
<i>Laugh and cry</i>

00:24.942 --> 00:29.988
<i>He's a family guy</i>

00:35.536 --> 00:37.079
Ah, the water park.

00:37.162 --> 00:38.539
Happy anniversary, Lois.

00:38.622 --> 00:40.624
Everybody, meet back here in six hours.

00:40.707 --> 00:44.378
I can't wait to get
everyone else's body water in my mouth.

00:50.717 --> 00:53.637
- Uh, where's the slide?
- Just eat this Starburst.

00:55.472 --> 00:59.685
- Wow! Lemons, oranges, cherries. So juicy.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.106
I don't think that was a Starburst.

01:04.189 --> 01:05.774
I think that may have just been acid.

01:05.858 --> 01:08.193
Would you like to ride
the Skittles rainbow now?

01:08.277 --> 01:09.403
Is it also acid?

01:09.486 --> 01:12.281
My friend, I'm an adult
who works at a water park.

01:12.364 --> 01:14.867
If I give you something, it's acid.

01:18.078 --> 01:21.665
No going down head first,
and wait till I say "It's okay."

01:21.748 --> 01:22.749
Go.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.251
Go.

01:24.376 --> 01:25.419
- Whoo!
- Go.

01:26.003 --> 01:28.380
- Hey!
- I'm gaining on you, Brian.

01:28.463 --> 01:31.091
Meg, slow down.
You're coming way too fast.

01:34.386 --> 01:37.764
- Ew, Brian, what happened?
- I don't know.

01:37.848 --> 01:41.351
Hey, idiot.
You got to wait till the guy says, "Go."

01:44.980 --> 01:47.399
Excuse me,
do you think you can help me out?

01:47.482 --> 01:49.651
Sure. But just let me do an awkward,

01:49.735 --> 01:52.362
extremely unattractive pool walk
over to you.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.705
- Hey, what's up?
- My top came off on the slide.

02:01.788 --> 02:05.459
I think I may have seen you
put it in your shorts.

02:05.542 --> 02:09.588
Okay. Well, here's my shorts,
just fish out the one that's yours.

02:11.423 --> 02:12.716
Thank you so much.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.594
- I'm Isabella.
- I'm Chris.

02:16.094 --> 02:20.516
And listen, my aunt is waiting for me,
but it was nice to meet you, Chris.

02:20.599 --> 02:23.143
You too. Enjoy the boobs of your
morning...

02:23.227 --> 02:24.561
Afternoon.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.813
Enjoy the boobs of your afternoon.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.569
My word, Chris,
that girl was totally into you.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.613
- You should ask her out.
- Really?

02:34.696 --> 02:36.281
But what if she says no?

02:36.365 --> 02:38.408
Hey, if you want something,
you've got to go for it.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.911
Just like the fat man did
when he changed his name.

02:41.828 --> 02:44.665
I'm looking for a Peter Ferrari.

02:45.499 --> 02:48.168
- Obviously, that's me.
- Yes.

02:48.252 --> 02:52.297
There's a soiled pair of Ferrari underwear
in the mens' room trash.

02:52.381 --> 02:54.591
Who took 'em out of sink?
They were soaking!

02:54.675 --> 02:55.884
Sir, I can't park this.

02:55.968 --> 02:59.346
There's diarrhea all over the front seat
of your PT Cruiser.

03:00.138 --> 03:03.725
Isabella! Listen, I'm not great at this,
but...

03:05.018 --> 03:06.061
Yup!

03:06.562 --> 03:07.688
Told you.

03:07.771 --> 03:10.148
Also, I was wondering
if there's any chance you maybe

03:10.232 --> 03:12.025
want to go out with me sometime?

03:12.109 --> 03:14.194
Oh, Chris, that's sweet.

03:14.278 --> 03:16.613
But I don't think
you'd want to go out with me.

03:16.697 --> 03:20.576
- Why not?
- It's just that... Well, I have kids.

03:20.659 --> 03:23.203
Oh, wow. And a couple of cuties.

03:23.287 --> 03:25.372
Have we got any teeth coming in?

03:25.455 --> 03:27.875
Oh. Oh, I think I feel something.

03:27.958 --> 03:29.585
Please... Please don't do that.

03:29.668 --> 03:31.461
Hey, your aunt is Consuela?

03:31.545 --> 03:33.797
- Hi, Consuela.
- You two know each other?

03:33.881 --> 03:36.842
Oh, yeah. "Lemon Pledge, no, no."
All that stuff.

03:36.925 --> 03:39.845
It's time to go, lemon Pledge, no, no.

03:40.470 --> 03:43.515
See? But wait. Isabella,

03:43.599 --> 03:46.977
I don't care that you have kids,
I'd still like to go out with you.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.479
Wow, that's really sweet, Chris.

03:49.563 --> 03:52.024
Okay, you're on. Here's my number.

03:55.068 --> 03:59.406
Oh, boy. I haven't been this excited
since our trip to Philadelphia.

03:59.865 --> 04:00.908
<i>Ladies and Gentlemen,</i>

04:00.991 --> 04:04.077
<i>flight 427 to Philadelphia has been</i>
<i>canceled.</i>

04:04.203 --> 04:05.495
Yay!

04:14.254 --> 04:15.631
I saw a <i>Lady and the Tramp,</i>

04:15.714 --> 04:18.217
so I asked if we could
eat spaghetti in the alley,

04:18.300 --> 04:21.803
but they said "no"
because of all the homeless masturbation.

04:22.137 --> 04:24.014
Oh, I love that movie.

04:24.306 --> 04:27.267
Chris, I'm having
a really nice time with you.

04:27.351 --> 04:28.519
You are?

04:28.602 --> 04:31.021
Listen, this is probably lame, but...

04:31.104 --> 04:33.690
I learned a little bit of your language,

04:33.774 --> 04:35.442
and I just wanted to say,

04:41.949 --> 04:43.367
What language is that?

04:43.450 --> 04:46.370
- You're Korean, are you not?
- No.

04:46.453 --> 04:47.788
I'm Mexican.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.718
Hey, Chris. Where are you off to?

05:01.802 --> 05:04.721
Oh, Isabella's coming by and we're
going to take the kids to the park.

05:04.972 --> 05:08.058
Wow, you two
are spending a lot of time together.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.477
Ah, are you sure
you want to date a girl

05:11.019 --> 05:13.063
who's had so much experience?

05:13.146 --> 05:14.231
What do you mean?

05:14.314 --> 05:17.734
Like, maybe she's got some city miles
on her hoo-hoo.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.319
Not to mention,
a couple of blowouts.

05:19.403 --> 05:21.154
- Hey, Bri...
- Yup. I heard you.

05:21.238 --> 05:23.031
She's talking about her kids, Chris.

05:23.115 --> 05:25.617
Oh, I don't care about that, Mom.

05:25.701 --> 05:28.328
I just want to make sure
you're not getting in over your head.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.289
Well, I'm sure
someone's already been in there

05:30.372 --> 05:31.999
deeper than that, Lois.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.001
Brian.

05:36.879 --> 05:38.505
Oh. Hello, Isabella.

05:38.589 --> 05:40.591
Hi, Mrs. Griffin, Mr. Griffin.

05:40.674 --> 05:43.135
Mr. Griffin's up here, sweetheart.

05:43.218 --> 05:45.095
Well, I guess you two have fun.

05:45.179 --> 05:46.805
Okay, bye.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.935
Look, I can see why you're concerned
that Chris's girlfriend has kids

05:52.019 --> 05:55.397
but he's happy,
and she seems like she's into him.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.691
Plus she's... She's hot.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.484
Yeah, she is.

06:00.611 --> 06:02.237
I bit my lip off.

06:11.830 --> 06:13.707
Go away, Mr. Herbert!

06:13.832 --> 06:16.168
It's not me. I'm in your closet.

06:18.712 --> 06:19.963
Isabella?

06:21.381 --> 06:22.716
Is everything okay?

06:22.799 --> 06:25.177
Chris, I just wanted to say "Goodbye."

06:25.260 --> 06:26.720
What? What do you mean?

06:26.803 --> 06:29.056
I found out that I'm going to be deported.

06:29.139 --> 06:31.725
They're sending me back to Mexico
in the morning.

06:31.808 --> 06:34.269
So in other words,
this could have waited till the morning.

06:34.353 --> 06:36.313
I didn't want to leave
without saying "Goodbye."

06:36.396 --> 06:38.106
But they can't send you away.

06:38.190 --> 06:41.610
- There's got to be something we can do.
- Unfortunately, there's not.

06:41.693 --> 06:45.864
But don't worry, I'm planning on getting
back into the country as soon as I can.

06:45.948 --> 06:48.909
What are you going to do?
Just leave the babies with Consuela?

06:48.992 --> 06:51.745
I wish I could,
but she works seven days a week,

06:51.828 --> 06:55.666
between housekeeping
and being the new CEO of Yahoo!

06:55.749 --> 06:57.793
Maybe we should improve
our business model.

06:57.876 --> 06:59.795
No, no.

06:59.878 --> 07:03.507
- Improve our original content?
- No, no.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.968
So we have no corporate identity?

07:06.051 --> 07:10.973
We secondary email
people use to sign up for porn sites.

07:11.515 --> 07:14.184
So are you taking your boys back with you?

07:14.268 --> 07:18.188
I guess I have no choice.
But I hate having to.

07:18.272 --> 07:21.525
The whole reason I left Mexico
was to give them a better life.

07:21.608 --> 07:24.027
Well, I could take them until you
get back.

07:24.111 --> 07:26.989
I mean, I'm no expert
at this sort of thing, but...

07:28.615 --> 07:30.993
Whoa, you're getting better at that.

07:31.076 --> 07:33.203
But I can't ask you
to take care of my children.

07:33.287 --> 07:35.956
Isabella, I want to do this.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.041
Chris, stop.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.210
You would really look after my kids
for me?

07:40.294 --> 07:41.670
Of course I would.

07:41.753 --> 07:43.839
You're a wonderful man, Chris Griffin.

07:43.922 --> 07:45.257
Thank you. <i>Gracias.</i>

07:45.340 --> 07:46.800
I'll be back as soon as I can.

07:56.143 --> 07:59.021
Don't worry,
I'm going to take good care of you.

07:59.104 --> 08:02.858
I'm going to call you "One,"
and I'm going to call you "Two."

08:03.317 --> 08:05.777
Good. He's been reading the book.

08:14.995 --> 08:18.207
Uh, Dad,
you're reading the paper upside down.

08:18.290 --> 08:20.042
Wrong again, idiot.

08:23.295 --> 08:25.297
Chris, what are you doing
with Isabella's babies?

08:25.380 --> 08:27.799
Why are you holding them that way?
You'll hurt them.

08:27.883 --> 08:30.719
- Where's Isabella?
- She got deported this morning.

08:30.802 --> 08:33.889
"Deported"?
And she just left her babies with you?

08:33.972 --> 08:36.099
Well, just until she can come back.

08:36.183 --> 08:39.937
Chris, are you crazy? What makes you think
you can take care of two babies?

08:40.020 --> 08:41.897
I don't know.
I've seen her take care of them.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.524
I see you with Stewie.

08:43.607 --> 08:45.484
Frankly, it doesn't seem that hard.

08:45.567 --> 08:47.778
You just shattered her world.

08:47.861 --> 08:48.904
Shattered!

08:49.196 --> 08:52.199
Absolutely not, Chris.
I will not allow this.

08:52.282 --> 08:55.202
Look, I made a promise to Isabella
and I'm going to keep it.

08:55.285 --> 08:58.330
Now if you'll excuse me,
these two need to eat.

08:58.830 --> 09:02.042
He bought a breastfeeding book,
someone may want to pop in on him.

09:02.209 --> 09:05.295
There's no way Chris is going to be
able to take care of two babies.

09:05.379 --> 09:08.423
Well, maybe he should have thought it out
before he opened his slut legs.

09:08.507 --> 09:12.302
No. Peter, that's not...
Anyway, we got to call child services.

09:12.386 --> 09:15.556
Lois, if you do that, Chris will
resent you for the rest of his life.

09:15.639 --> 09:17.099
Then what do you suggest we do?

09:17.182 --> 09:18.642
I say you let him try.

09:18.725 --> 09:21.895
Trust me, one day of watching those kids
and he'll want 'em out of here.

09:21.979 --> 09:23.897
All right. Fine.

09:23.981 --> 09:26.733
Yes. Taking care of kids is a 24-hour job.

09:26.817 --> 09:29.528
Like when I worked at that all-night diner
from that painting.

09:30.529 --> 09:33.198
They kicked me out of the war
for kissing a guy.

09:37.744 --> 09:40.581
All right, guys,
nothing but the best for you two.

09:40.664 --> 09:45.043
So I got you, all organic, non-GMO,
no hormone food.

09:45.127 --> 09:46.587
That'll be $500.

09:46.670 --> 09:48.797
Ah, well, sorry, kids.

09:48.881 --> 09:50.632
Looks like we're going to go
to Jersey Mike's

09:50.716 --> 09:53.010
and hope that future science will save us.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.637
Yay! We're jar people.

09:56.805 --> 09:58.891
Ah! Science, help!

09:59.266 --> 10:00.350
<i>Jersey Mike's.</i>

10:00.475 --> 10:03.145
<i>Bring your girlfriend with the fat ass</i>
<i>in here.</i>

10:09.276 --> 10:10.736
Hey, guys, how about a little TV?

10:10.819 --> 10:12.863
We can watch a baby thing together.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.908
<i>Baby Einstein, Muppet Babies...</i>

10:15.991 --> 10:18.285
Ah, what's <i>CSI Babies?</i>

10:19.745 --> 10:23.040
What's this? They can't solve this crime.
They're just frightened babies.

10:23.123 --> 10:26.084
They don't even know it's a crime,
they just know their parents aren't there.

10:26.168 --> 10:27.544
They're scared, now I'm scared.

10:27.628 --> 10:29.254
- Turn this off!

10:29.338 --> 10:32.841
Ah! That's not what I want.
I'm going to go hide in my couch fort.

10:34.885 --> 10:37.095
Is <i>CSI Babies</i> over yet?

10:39.723 --> 10:42.643
Oh, hello, Consuela.
You must be here for the twins?

10:42.726 --> 10:44.937
No. No take babies.

10:45.020 --> 10:48.065
I have good news
and "ay-ay-ay" news.

10:48.148 --> 10:51.235
Okay.
Give us the "ay-ay-ay" news first.

10:51.318 --> 10:55.030
Isabella no can come back.
Stuck in Mexico.

10:55.113 --> 10:57.366
The babies, they stay here.

10:57.449 --> 10:59.243
- What?
- What's the good news?

10:59.326 --> 11:02.287
Good news is bus get new wiper blades.

11:02.371 --> 11:03.372
No more...

11:06.500 --> 11:09.920
Well, these kids are not staying here.
You got to take them.

11:10.003 --> 11:14.550
How can I take them when I was never here?

11:17.344 --> 11:20.180
Wow! She's like the Mexican David Blaine.

11:20.472 --> 11:22.432
Wait. Is David Blaine Mexican?

11:22.516 --> 11:24.268
- He's something.
- Peter, forget that.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.352
What are we going to do?

11:25.435 --> 11:27.604
Chris can't just be stuck
with these babies.

11:27.688 --> 11:30.065
Why not? I'm doing a great job.

11:30.148 --> 11:32.651
I love Isabella and I love her kids.

11:32.734 --> 11:36.530
Chris, you're living in a dream land.
How are you going to support two babies?

11:36.613 --> 11:39.491
I could just take some time off school
and get a job.

11:39.575 --> 11:41.493
No. Absolutely not.

11:41.577 --> 11:43.036
Well, hold on, Lois. Hold on.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.789
Maybe Chris getting a job
is not the worst idea.

11:45.873 --> 11:49.459
I mean, I made pretty good money
when I hosted that confusing game show.

11:49.543 --> 11:51.795
All right, Phil, come stand by me.
It's Ashley's turn.

11:51.879 --> 11:54.715
Ashley, go ahead. Pick an answer,
find the question, spin the table,

11:54.798 --> 11:57.050
and remember
the clock is ticking backwards.

11:57.426 --> 11:59.469
- I'll pass.

11:59.553 --> 12:03.390
Congrats, you win. Sorry to see you go.
And, Phil, we'll see you tomorrow.

12:03.473 --> 12:04.600
Well, that's all the time we have.

12:04.683 --> 12:08.103
For those of you playing at home,
"Why and how?"

12:08.187 --> 12:11.773
- Audience?
- "Why and how?"

12:11.857 --> 12:12.941
Stop that!

12:13.066 --> 12:14.109
Forget it.

12:14.193 --> 12:16.195
I will not allow you to drop out
of school.

12:16.320 --> 12:18.488
If Isabella can't get here
to take her kids back,

12:18.572 --> 12:20.407
we'll just have to bring them to her.

12:20.490 --> 12:22.117
What? What do you mean?

12:22.201 --> 12:26.121
I mean, we're going to Mexico, so we can
give these kids back to their mother.

12:26.205 --> 12:27.789
Peter, back me up here.

12:27.873 --> 12:30.667
<i>Let's get those kids back to their momma</i>

12:32.669 --> 12:35.172
Look how winded he is
from doing that one spin.

12:35.255 --> 12:38.759
Your mother's right, Chris.
We're going to Mexico.

12:41.011 --> 12:42.471
I got to sit.

12:47.601 --> 12:49.353
All right. We're off to Mexico.

12:49.436 --> 12:52.523
If you kids are good, we'll bring you back
a tangled marionette.

12:52.606 --> 12:54.525
Is it going to be a long trip, Dad?

12:54.608 --> 12:55.609
No, not too bad.

12:55.692 --> 12:58.320
Especially since we're going to do it
to the wrong stock footage.

13:08.789 --> 13:10.290
Boy, what a trip!

13:14.211 --> 13:17.214
Chris, are you sure this is
Isabella's village?

13:17.297 --> 13:18.882
This place looks pretty rough.

13:18.966 --> 13:21.885
Yeah, this is it. Santa Terrible.

13:22.427 --> 13:23.804
Look, there she is!

13:24.638 --> 13:27.599
Chris, what in the mind of Mencia
are you doing here?

13:28.058 --> 13:31.854
- My babies.
- Isabella, I missed you so much.

13:31.979 --> 13:34.273
<i>Ay,</i> Chris, I missed you, too.

13:34.356 --> 13:36.900
Look, Isabella, you shouldn't be
separated from your children,

13:36.984 --> 13:38.443
so we've brought them to you.

13:38.527 --> 13:41.154
We wish you all the best.
Say "Goodbye," Chris.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.240
Mom, we can't just leave them here.

13:43.323 --> 13:46.451
This is no place
for Isabella to raise a family.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.877
Oh, you're right, Chris.

13:55.002 --> 13:57.838
I didn't want you to have to
raise those babies yourself.

13:57.921 --> 14:02.551
But as a mom, I don't know if I can
in good conscience leave this family here.

14:02.634 --> 14:05.387
We'll just have to smuggle her
and her babies back in.

14:05.470 --> 14:07.806
Well, no one's better at smuggling
than El Chapo.

14:07.890 --> 14:08.974
Maybe he can help us.

14:09.057 --> 14:11.185
How are you going to get El Chapo to help?

14:11.310 --> 14:14.438
It's easy. All you got to do is say,
"Dyed, black eyebrows"

14:14.521 --> 14:16.899
into the wind and he appears.

14:17.024 --> 14:19.484
"Dyed, black eyebrows."

14:19.568 --> 14:22.321
- Can I help you?
- Peter Gallagher.

14:22.404 --> 14:24.656
- Maybe I can help.
- Mark Cuban.

14:24.740 --> 14:27.242
Now we're getting
all the wrong eyebrow guys.

14:33.498 --> 14:36.960
Mrs. Griffin, you would take the risk
of smuggling me and my children

14:37.044 --> 14:38.128
across the border?

14:38.212 --> 14:39.922
But you could be arrested.

14:40.005 --> 14:41.089
I realize that.

14:41.173 --> 14:44.301
But you have just as much right
to a decent life for your children

14:44.384 --> 14:45.469
as anyone else.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.054
Now, we just need a plan.

14:47.137 --> 14:49.431
All right. What if we run?

14:49.515 --> 14:52.893
Damn it, Peter!
What about Quagmire?

14:52.976 --> 14:54.978
He could probably get his hands
on a plane.

14:55.062 --> 14:57.105
Lois, that's actually a great idea.

14:57.189 --> 14:59.483
"Actually"? Why are you saying
it like that?

14:59.566 --> 15:01.652
And Quagmire owes me a favor anyway.
Remember?

15:01.735 --> 15:04.488
Last time he went out of town,
I sat on his eggs for him.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.324
Peter, it's time for lunch.

15:07.658 --> 15:10.327
Sorry, Lois. Can't leave the eggs
till Quagmire gets back.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.412
We're having sloppy joes.

15:12.746 --> 15:15.749
Well, I guess I haven't seen
that mongoose in a while.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.961
- We're having sloppy joes.
- Yeah, I heard.

15:19.044 --> 15:21.922
- Please say you got the onion bun.
<i>- We're having sloppy joes.</i>

15:22.005 --> 15:23.423
Mongoose!

15:25.634 --> 15:26.927
Mongeese!

15:35.561 --> 15:38.397
Hey, just a heads up.
My dad's friend, Mr. Quagmire,

15:38.480 --> 15:41.900
is going to say a lot of stuff to you
and it's all going to be disgusting.

15:41.984 --> 15:44.903
Hey, you must be Isabella.
I came as soon as I heard about you.

15:44.987 --> 15:47.489
And then I got on my plane.
All right.

15:47.573 --> 15:48.740
Hold it right there!

15:50.450 --> 15:52.077
Uh-oh. Somebody's coming.

15:52.160 --> 15:53.203
No, no. Hold on. Hold on.

15:53.287 --> 15:55.873
I put my business card in a fish bowl
at an El Torito.

15:55.956 --> 15:57.040
This could be about that.

15:58.792 --> 16:00.377
<i>Policía!</i> Put your hands up.

16:01.128 --> 16:03.172
Is this about the raffle for the free
lunch?

16:03.255 --> 16:05.632
Does it have to be during the week?
Because I...

16:05.716 --> 16:09.261
Wait a second. Are we being arrested?
We've done nothing wrong.

16:09.344 --> 16:12.097
We're not arresting you,
we're taking your plane.

16:16.185 --> 16:19.188
And Javier, get their keys
and take their SUV.

16:24.610 --> 16:27.070
Ah, that stupid fat guido.

16:27.154 --> 16:29.198
No, Peter, that's the wrong racial slur.

16:29.281 --> 16:31.408
No, I know.
I was just thinking about Snooki.

16:37.831 --> 16:41.084
Wait. I can't believe
there'd be corrupt cops in Mexico.

16:41.168 --> 16:43.337
Yeah, Donald Trump was right.

16:43.420 --> 16:45.881
His daughter is a hot piece of ass.

16:45.964 --> 16:47.966
Uh, you guys, don't panic.

16:48.050 --> 16:50.177
But there's a couple of coyotes
over there.

16:52.262 --> 16:54.681
Oh, like <i>Coyote Ugly</i> with Piper Perabo.

16:55.098 --> 17:00.103
Is that Pari... Pari-bow? Para... Para...
Para-boo.

17:00.187 --> 17:02.940
Para-boo. Say it with me. Par... Para-bow.

17:03.023 --> 17:05.108
Is that right? It's weird,
but you remember.

17:05.192 --> 17:06.193
You know, I guess...

17:06.276 --> 17:07.778
I guess that's the point.

17:07.861 --> 17:11.031
- You think she's set for life?
- Peter, we're about to die!

17:13.242 --> 17:14.826
No. My babies.

17:14.910 --> 17:17.371
Get out of here! You leave them alone.

17:18.205 --> 17:19.540
Ow!

17:19.957 --> 17:21.083
Ah, Chris!

17:28.632 --> 17:30.634
You guys, I've been bit!

17:30.717 --> 17:33.220
And he got away
with my friendship bracelet.

17:33.303 --> 17:36.849
- You are a boy.
- Chris, you saved my babies.

17:36.932 --> 17:40.727
Oh, my God, Peter, we did nothing.
We're his parents and we did nothing.

17:40.811 --> 17:44.648
I know. But, wow... Did you see
how Chris took care of those kids?

17:44.731 --> 17:48.277
Up till now the only thing he could
take care of was my traffic tickets.

17:48.360 --> 17:50.821
- Name?
- Uh, Peter Griffin.

17:50.904 --> 17:54.324
Peter Griffin's here to surrender
for his vehicular manslaughter.

17:54.408 --> 17:56.660
What? No! I'm a good boy.

17:58.287 --> 17:59.955
He is a good boy.

18:09.047 --> 18:10.507
Oh, this is awful.

18:10.591 --> 18:13.260
Chris is injured and we're completely
out of food and water.

18:13.343 --> 18:17.347
I know. I'm so thirsty,
I'll be willing to drink anyone's pee.

18:17.431 --> 18:21.268
Not yours, Chris, or Peter.
But, you know... You know, anyone.

18:21.351 --> 18:24.313
Mom, Dad, thanks for trying to help.

18:24.396 --> 18:26.940
You know, I just wanted
to do the right thing,

18:27.024 --> 18:28.734
but now we're all going to die.

18:28.817 --> 18:31.111
Did... Did you gals hear my pee thing?

18:35.365 --> 18:38.327
Time for clean getaway.

18:38.410 --> 18:39.870
- Consuela?
<i>- Tia.</i>

18:39.953 --> 18:42.706
<i>Ay.</i> Thank God. How did you find us?

18:42.789 --> 18:44.917
Babies' earring have chip.

18:48.629 --> 18:51.715
Oh, well, this is great.
Can you help us get to the border?

18:51.798 --> 18:54.134
Oh, you already in United States.

18:54.218 --> 18:56.803
- We are?
- Yes. This Texas.

18:56.887 --> 19:01.391
What? So we walked right across the border
and didn't even know it?

19:01.475 --> 19:03.810
That is a problem, right?

19:03.894 --> 19:07.606
I mean, politics aside,
we can all agree that is a problem.

19:11.944 --> 19:13.237
Thanks for the ride, Consuela.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.989
And thanks for taking us
on that little detour to Dollywood.

19:16.073 --> 19:18.158
Was I right or was I right?

19:18.242 --> 19:20.869
Yup. Totally worth the extra two days.

19:21.703 --> 19:24.081
Look, Chris. I owe you an apology.

19:24.164 --> 19:25.666
I didn't believe in you.

19:25.749 --> 19:28.168
I was wrong to say
you couldn't handle the responsibility

19:28.252 --> 19:30.170
of taking care of two kids.

19:30.254 --> 19:32.256
You risked your life for those babies.

19:32.339 --> 19:34.299
Well, I didn't want them to get hurt.

19:34.383 --> 19:38.595
That's right. Because you care about them
just like you care about Isabella.

19:39.179 --> 19:42.891
And if you want to continue to date her
and be a part of those kids' lives,

19:42.975 --> 19:45.185
I'd be just fine with that.

19:45.269 --> 19:48.814
Are you kidding? Screw that.
Looking after babies is a nightmare.

19:48.897 --> 19:50.774
Oh, you have no idea.

19:50.858 --> 19:52.776
You know how many times
I had you kids in the oven

19:52.860 --> 19:54.736
just daring myself to turn it on?

19:55.153 --> 19:58.782
Well, thanks for trusting me
to figure it out for myself.

19:58.866 --> 20:02.369
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you too, sweetheart.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.086
Isabella, being with you
has been really great.

20:11.170 --> 20:13.130
But I think I realized my mom was right.

20:13.213 --> 20:15.883
I'm too young to be taking on
this much responsibility.

20:16.300 --> 20:17.634
I understand.

20:17.718 --> 20:21.305
But I know someday
you will make an incredible father.

20:21.388 --> 20:23.557
- Goodbye, Chris.
- Goodbye, Isabella.

20:31.732 --> 20:35.194
Chris, time for dinner.
We're having sloppy joes.

20:35.277 --> 20:38.322
- Oh, boy!
- We're having sloppy joes.

20:38.405 --> 20:40.073
Yeah, I heard you.

20:41.283 --> 20:43.702
Oh, dear God. Oh, they're all dead.

20:43.785 --> 20:45.954
No! Please, no!

20:54.087 --> 20:55.923
<i>We're having sloppy joes.</i>

20:57.049 --> 20:59.218
<i>We're having sloppy joes.</i>

20:59.927 --> 21:01.762
<i>We're having sloppy joes.</i>
