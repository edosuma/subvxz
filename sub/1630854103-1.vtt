WEBVTT

03:23.939 --> 03:25.507
Eat up!

03:32.748 --> 03:35.483
One day you'll never
see me again.

03:36.719 --> 03:38.386
That's right, Charlie.

03:39.755 --> 03:41.623
The farm life may be it for you,

03:41.657 --> 03:43.357
but it sure ain't for me.

03:45.928 --> 03:47.162
I'm special.

03:47.196 --> 03:50.866
Mama's gonna feel real stupid
when she finds out, won't she?

03:59.407 --> 04:02.745
One day, the whole world's
gonna know my name.

04:03.712 --> 04:06.582
You agree, don't you, Mary?

04:07.850 --> 04:10.485
Oh. Why, thank you.

04:20.562 --> 04:23.264
I do love a good audience.

04:28.369 --> 04:30.939
Y'all see me
for who I really am.

04:37.546 --> 04:39.014
A star.

04:48.356 --> 04:50.993
What are you doing in here,
Mr. Goose?

05:38.472 --> 05:39.942
Theda!

05:44.780 --> 05:46.347
Go on, girl.

05:55.791 --> 05:57.526
Take it.

06:24.586 --> 06:27.956
You aren't to indulge
in any more such foolishness.

06:27.990 --> 06:30.125
It's just dancing, Mama.

06:30.158 --> 06:32.561
It's selfish is what it is.

06:32.594 --> 06:34.129
With all the farmhands gone,

06:34.162 --> 06:36.265
I can't do everything
around here myself.

06:40.135 --> 06:41.570
I help.

06:56.852 --> 06:58.987
Anything
for me in the post today?

06:59.021 --> 07:00.155
No.

07:05.894 --> 07:08.897
It says the Allies
have taken control of France.

07:08.931 --> 07:10.832
You can read it after supper.

07:10.866 --> 07:12.801
But, Mama, this could
mean the end of the war!

07:12.834 --> 07:15.103
Do as I ask, Pearl.

07:15.137 --> 07:18.173
I don't want to hear about any
more dead Germans tonight.

07:28.784 --> 07:30.719
Supper's ready, Daddy.

07:37.225 --> 07:38.293
<i>Bless us, O' Lord,</i>

07:38.327 --> 07:40.696
<i>and these thy gifts
which we are about</i>

07:40.729 --> 07:42.264
to receive from thy bounty

07:42.297 --> 07:45.767
through Christ
our Lord. Amen.

07:45.801 --> 07:46.902
Amen.

08:26.808 --> 08:29.044
"My precious Pearl.

08:29.077 --> 08:32.881
"It feels as if it has been
an eternity without you.

08:32.914 --> 08:34.950
"All we do is walk, it seems.

08:34.982 --> 08:38.253
"I never know if we'll get to
where they say we're going.

08:38.285 --> 08:40.822
"They have us chew
on bouillon cubes

08:40.856 --> 08:42.823
"so we don't notice
the pains in our feet.

08:42.857 --> 08:46.328
"I find it most frightening
at night in the trenches.

08:46.361 --> 08:47.596
<i>"The mortar shells
are deafening.</i>

08:47.629 --> 08:51.066
<i>"Many soldiers have
gone mad with the fear.</i>

08:51.099 --> 08:52.200
<i>"Carnage from the gas</i>

08:52.234 --> 08:54.603
<i>"has shown me things
I won't soon forget,</i>

08:54.636 --> 08:56.805
<i>"and thinking of you
has been my only reprieve.</i>

08:56.838 --> 08:59.841
"I will always be proud
to serve my country,

08:59.875 --> 09:02.044
<i>"but one thing
this war has made clear</i>

09:02.077 --> 09:04.212
<i>"is that I cannot wait
to return home</i>

09:04.246 --> 09:05.781
"and begin our life together.

09:05.814 --> 09:08.350
"I never want to be away
from you again.

09:08.383 --> 09:10.218
"Till death do us part.

09:10.252 --> 09:13.155
"Your loving husband,
Howard."

09:28.270 --> 09:30.105
I'll go to town tomorrow.

09:32.374 --> 09:34.209
Pick up more medicine.

09:39.714 --> 09:42.084
Which means I get
to stop by the pictures.

09:44.820 --> 09:47.022
Just don't tell Mama.

09:47.055 --> 09:50.225
They show all the best
dancers at the pictures.

09:55.664 --> 09:58.033
I could be on the line
with those girls one day.

10:00.235 --> 10:01.603
I know I could.

10:14.983 --> 10:16.184
Pearl.

10:17.786 --> 10:20.122
I didn't want to waste
the hot water.

10:23.391 --> 10:26.194
The money for his medicine
is on the kitchen table.

10:31.032 --> 10:33.435
Remember to cover your face.

10:33.468 --> 10:35.837
And don't linger close
to anyone.

10:35.871 --> 10:39.274
Papers are warning
of a lethal resurgence.

10:39.307 --> 10:42.344
God forbid sickness
returns to our home.

11:09.771 --> 11:11.439
The time is now...

11:18.480 --> 11:19.981
Two-bits, please.

12:58.413 --> 12:59.981
Did you enjoy the picture?

13:06.354 --> 13:07.355
Cigarette?

13:09.257 --> 13:10.392
Oh, go on.
I don't have the bug.

13:17.098 --> 13:18.233
You like the movies?

13:19.034 --> 13:20.402
I like dancing.

13:20.435 --> 13:22.605
Oh, a future Tiller Girl.

13:22.638 --> 13:24.072
I can see it now.

13:24.105 --> 13:26.074
I wish.

13:26.107 --> 13:27.409
Why not?
You're pretty enough.

13:31.346 --> 13:33.549
On account of a husband,
I gather?

13:34.382 --> 13:35.551
He's overseas,

13:37.886 --> 13:40.523
but my father's infirmed,
so I have to help at home.

13:40.556 --> 13:41.990
I'm sorry to hear that.

13:43.091 --> 13:44.959
You want to come
watch the second show?

13:46.428 --> 13:47.563
Free admission.

13:50.365 --> 13:51.966
I'm the projectionist.

13:54.969 --> 13:57.472
I need to get going.

13:57.506 --> 14:01.076
Mama's expecting me,
but I appreciate the, um...

14:01.109 --> 14:02.477
Stay there for just
one minute, would you?

14:04.647 --> 14:05.880
Okay.

14:25.200 --> 14:26.602
From what you just saw.

14:27.670 --> 14:29.404
Aren't you showing it again?

14:29.437 --> 14:31.072
Ah... Sure,
but it's only one frame.

14:31.106 --> 14:33.141
Nobody will notice once
I splice it back together.

14:33.174 --> 14:34.275
You know, caring for your family

14:34.309 --> 14:35.511
during these times is admirable.

14:35.544 --> 14:37.312
You ought to take pride in that,

14:37.345 --> 14:39.447
but don't forget to live
your life, too.

14:39.481 --> 14:40.549
I wouldn't mind seeing you

14:40.583 --> 14:43.051
up on that screen
one day, missus...

14:43.985 --> 14:44.986
Pearl.

14:47.556 --> 14:49.558
Well, if you come back,

14:49.592 --> 14:51.960
knock on this door.
I'm always here, and,

14:51.993 --> 14:54.062
well, I can run the pictures
as much as I like.

14:54.396 --> 14:55.564
Thank you.

14:56.498 --> 14:57.499
I will.

17:25.445 --> 17:27.816
May I have this dance?

18:54.268 --> 18:55.804
I'm married!

19:09.384 --> 19:10.653
Shh...

20:22.658 --> 20:24.626
What took you so long?

20:24.660 --> 20:26.327
It's a far ride, Mama.

20:28.597 --> 20:29.932
What is on your head?

20:31.967 --> 20:33.702
Found it along the road.

20:34.703 --> 20:36.672
Do not bring it inside.

20:36.705 --> 20:38.507
It may be covered in germs.

20:41.710 --> 20:43.612
Wash your hair.

20:43.645 --> 20:45.514
If you're lucky,
it's only full of lice.

20:46.915 --> 20:49.283
When you finish,
your father needs changing.

20:50.318 --> 20:51.820
Don't let him sit in his mess.

20:58.426 --> 21:00.729
I saw a new picture today.

21:00.763 --> 21:03.932
You'd have liked it.
The girls were all flawless.

21:03.966 --> 21:06.001
There's no room
for even the tiniest

21:06.034 --> 21:09.071
lack of precision
in a troupe like that.

21:09.104 --> 21:11.507
It takes absolute perfection.

21:11.540 --> 21:14.610
What a charmed life it
must be to star in the movies.

22:08.396 --> 22:10.398
Are you still in there?

22:44.633 --> 22:46.902
Bless us, O' Lord,
and these thy gifts

22:46.935 --> 22:50.005
which we are about to
receive from thy bounty

22:50.038 --> 22:53.075
through Christ
our Lord. Amen.

22:53.108 --> 22:54.375
Amen.

23:08.090 --> 23:10.092
Where is the rest of
the money I lent you?

23:12.127 --> 23:15.097
- There was none.
- I can count, Pearl.

23:16.131 --> 23:17.532
There are eight cents missing.

23:18.967 --> 23:21.803
I may have gotten some
hard candy for the trip home.

23:27.676 --> 23:28.577
That is enough, then.

23:28.610 --> 23:31.013
You ate the candy,
that was your supper.

23:31.046 --> 23:34.917
The food I worked hard
to prepare alone is not.

23:36.251 --> 23:39.154
But, Mama, I rode all
that way. I'm starving.

23:39.187 --> 23:41.556
You may have what's
left of it in the morning.

23:45.928 --> 23:48.130
- Where are you going?
- To bed!

23:48.163 --> 23:50.666
I did not excuse you
from the table.

24:29.538 --> 24:30.806
I know that.

24:30.839 --> 24:32.674
And I am careful.

24:51.727 --> 24:53.028
Good.

25:11.913 --> 25:13.582
Please, Lord,

25:13.615 --> 25:17.052
make me the biggest star
the world has ever known

25:17.085 --> 25:20.922
so that I may get far,
far away from this place.

25:24.826 --> 25:25.994
Amen.

26:36.765 --> 26:38.934
Afternoon, Pearl!

26:38.967 --> 26:41.903
Hi, Mitsy!
I like your dress.

26:42.370 --> 26:44.706
Oh, thank you.

26:44.739 --> 26:46.675
It feels wonderful
to finally be able to

26:46.708 --> 26:48.643
don something pretty again.

26:48.677 --> 26:50.679
It's the first time
we've left home in weeks.

26:50.712 --> 26:52.914
Mother is so afraid
of getting ill.

26:52.948 --> 26:54.216
Mama, too.

26:54.249 --> 26:55.684
Well, we were a bit worried

26:55.717 --> 26:57.919
about the both of you
being out here all alone,

26:57.953 --> 26:59.921
so we brought some food.

26:59.955 --> 27:01.389
That's very kind.

27:01.423 --> 27:02.958
How have you been getting on?

27:03.859 --> 27:05.894
Any new letters from Howard?

27:05.927 --> 27:07.395
- Uh-uh.
- Oh, well...

27:07.429 --> 27:10.165
Mother has been
riddled with worry.

27:10.198 --> 27:12.968
They say no news
is good news, though.

27:13.001 --> 27:14.703
If only his pride
hadn't gotten him

27:14.736 --> 27:16.838
involved in this dreadful war.

27:16.872 --> 27:17.973
You know we had a doctor

27:18.006 --> 27:19.975
willing to declare him
ineligible?

27:20.008 --> 27:22.110
Anyone would've taken
that opportunity.

27:22.144 --> 27:23.011
Not Howard.

27:23.044 --> 27:25.814
First, he runs off
to become a farmer.

27:25.847 --> 27:27.115
Now, the army.

27:27.149 --> 27:31.186
The lengths my brother will
go to just to spite his father.

27:31.219 --> 27:33.021
All this isolation
has been enough

27:33.054 --> 27:34.789
to make one mad, hasn't it?

27:35.223 --> 27:37.259
It really has.

27:37.292 --> 27:39.694
No, we don't accept charity.

27:39.728 --> 27:42.164
Oh, for God's sake, Ruth.
It's just a pig.

27:46.268 --> 27:48.170
Can I share
a secret with you, Pearl?

27:52.307 --> 27:53.975
Mother would throttle me

27:54.009 --> 27:56.244
if she knew I was
planning on attending.

27:56.278 --> 27:59.381
But there's a dance audition
this Saturday at our church

27:59.414 --> 28:01.216
for a Christmas chorus line

28:01.249 --> 28:02.150
to bring merriment to folks

28:02.184 --> 28:04.386
throughout the state
during the holidays.

28:04.419 --> 28:07.322
Word is, they're putting
together a troupe

28:07.355 --> 28:09.491
and will be touring
seven different cities

28:09.525 --> 28:10.859
before the year ends.

28:10.892 --> 28:12.761
Don't that sound exciting?

28:12.794 --> 28:15.063
I would love so much
to be a part of it.

28:15.096 --> 28:16.331
So would I.

28:16.364 --> 28:18.333
We should go together then.

28:18.366 --> 28:21.136
But you can't tell a soul.

28:21.169 --> 28:22.437
I would never.

28:22.470 --> 28:24.906
Splendid.
It'll be our secret.

28:24.940 --> 28:26.341
Mitsy!

28:27.075 --> 28:28.143
I better skedaddle.

28:28.176 --> 28:31.346
We got three more pigs
to drop off this afternoon.

28:32.881 --> 28:34.916
Saturday at 11:00.

28:34.950 --> 28:36.351
Okay.

28:36.384 --> 28:38.353
Sister-in-laws have to
stick together, right?

28:38.386 --> 28:40.388
Mitsy!

28:40.422 --> 28:42.924
- Time to go!
- See you later, Pearl.

28:44.960 --> 28:46.161
Bye, Mitsy!

28:51.266 --> 28:53.902
Charlie, this could be it.

30:08.544 --> 30:09.911
Pearl?

30:19.588 --> 30:20.989
Pearl!

32:00.689 --> 32:02.023
Well,

32:02.056 --> 32:04.192
I didn't expect to see you
again this soon.

32:24.078 --> 32:25.246
Have a seat.

32:36.057 --> 32:37.325
I can't believe you get to see

32:37.358 --> 32:39.427
the pictures every day for free.

32:39.461 --> 32:41.196
Yeah, not a bad gig, huh?

32:46.234 --> 32:48.269
Thank you.

32:50.238 --> 32:51.707
So, to what do I owe
this pleasure?

32:53.776 --> 32:55.276
I've been thinking a lot about

32:55.310 --> 32:56.712
what you said to me
the other day

32:56.745 --> 32:58.747
about not forgetting
to live my life,

32:59.414 --> 33:01.015
and, well,

33:01.049 --> 33:03.786
there's a dance audition
coming up at the church.

33:03.819 --> 33:05.420
Oh, I like the sound of that.

33:06.221 --> 33:08.456
So do I...

33:08.490 --> 33:11.326
But I've never really danced
in front of anyone before.

33:13.094 --> 33:15.230
What if I'm not perfect?

33:15.263 --> 33:17.365
You can do anything
if you want it bad enough.

33:18.834 --> 33:21.202
I want it.

33:21.236 --> 33:23.304
Then don't let anything
stand in your way.

33:25.440 --> 33:27.208
What would you like to see?

33:27.810 --> 33:29.244
<i>Palace Follies.</i>

33:29.277 --> 33:32.113
Oh, come on.
You saw that already.

33:32.146 --> 33:33.414
How about something
different tonight?

33:33.448 --> 33:34.683
How about...

33:38.386 --> 33:41.456
How about a film
nobody else has seen?

33:41.757 --> 33:42.758
Okay.

33:44.492 --> 33:45.528
I picked this one up while

33:45.561 --> 33:47.295
I was in the service in France.

33:53.468 --> 33:54.537
Do you live in here?

33:57.138 --> 34:00.509
I lay my head on that pillow
from time to time,

34:00.543 --> 34:03.378
but I wouldn't say I live
anywhere in particular.

34:03.411 --> 34:07.115
I'm what more civilized people
refer to as bohemian.

34:08.551 --> 34:09.652
I don't know what that is.

34:09.685 --> 34:13.221
It means I can pack up
and leave whenever I want to.

34:13.889 --> 34:16.090
Sounds like a dream.

34:16.123 --> 34:18.627
Just as long
as I can keep from waking up.

34:44.319 --> 34:46.219
What is this?

34:46.254 --> 34:47.590
Just watch.

35:19.688 --> 35:22.591
Never seen anything like
that before now, have you?

35:24.492 --> 35:26.494
There are all kinds of
underground stag films

35:26.528 --> 35:27.730
like this out there.

35:29.497 --> 35:30.766
Is it legal?

35:30.799 --> 35:33.535
Doing it, yeah.

35:34.637 --> 35:36.237
Filming it, no.

35:37.405 --> 35:40.475
Not here, anyway.
It will be eventually.

35:40.509 --> 35:44.178
People would pay an arm
and a leg to see this.

35:44.212 --> 35:46.615
Pictures like this are going
to revolutionize the industry

35:46.649 --> 35:49.918
and I, for one, plan on
capitalizing early.

35:51.219 --> 35:53.354
It's reality.

35:53.388 --> 35:56.391
There's no denying
we all share a fascination

35:56.424 --> 35:59.327
in seeing people
as they truly are.

36:00.294 --> 36:02.163
I don't like reality.

36:05.901 --> 36:07.435
Where I live, I mean.

36:08.336 --> 36:09.505
So leave.

36:17.478 --> 36:19.280
It's not that easy.

36:19.313 --> 36:20.415
Well, sure it is.

36:20.448 --> 36:21.449
There's a road
right out front there

36:21.482 --> 36:23.418
that'll take you all the
way to New York City.

36:25.020 --> 36:27.589
One day my mother and father
will be gone.

36:29.357 --> 36:31.325
I can do what I want then.

36:31.359 --> 36:32.728
What if that's too late?

36:34.495 --> 36:36.264
The fact and truth
of the matter is, Pearl,

36:37.298 --> 36:39.635
you only get
one take at this life.

36:39.668 --> 36:42.004
And if you don't make the
most of it when you're young,

36:42.037 --> 36:43.872
you don't get a second chance.

36:46.942 --> 36:49.277
If only they would just die.

36:53.582 --> 36:54.583
Pardon?

36:57.986 --> 36:59.220
Nothing.

37:03.659 --> 37:06.995
It's real nice to be able to
talk to someone for a change.

37:07.029 --> 37:09.531
Been cooped up
on that farm for so long

37:09.565 --> 37:11.600
sometimes I worry that maybe

37:11.633 --> 37:14.268
I'm not the same
as other people.

37:15.436 --> 37:18.406
Why would you ever want
to be like everybody else?

37:20.075 --> 37:21.409
I don't know.

37:23.612 --> 37:26.849
Sometimes it just seems
more peaceful, I guess.

37:37.826 --> 37:39.895
Did you mean what you said?

37:39.928 --> 37:42.330
About wanting to see me
up on that screen?

37:43.799 --> 37:45.000
Sure, I did.

37:45.968 --> 37:47.936
I'd do anything to be up there.

37:49.738 --> 37:51.073
Well, then,
you ought to go overseas

37:51.106 --> 37:52.808
when this pandemic ends.

37:52.841 --> 37:54.442
That's what I'm doing.

37:54.475 --> 37:56.812
The arts are so much more
alive in Europe.

37:56.845 --> 37:58.781
You can be whoever
you want to be there.

37:59.915 --> 38:01.382
Really?

38:01.415 --> 38:02.985
You could even be
in pictures like this.

38:04.385 --> 38:05.621
I know I'd watch you.

38:12.094 --> 38:13.595
I should go now.

38:17.465 --> 38:18.466
Thank you.

38:19.467 --> 38:20.969
What for?

38:21.003 --> 38:22.538
For seeing me tonight.

39:48.123 --> 39:49.591
What are you staring at?

40:32.167 --> 40:33.869
Theda!

40:43.912 --> 40:45.479
I'm leaving soon.

40:50.752 --> 40:53.088
I can't stay here any longer.

40:54.890 --> 40:56.959
Howard was supposed
to take me away.

40:59.728 --> 41:00.963
It'd be easier for me

41:00.996 --> 41:03.497
if I didn't feel like
I was abandoning you.

41:05.734 --> 41:06.802
You understand that?

41:12.941 --> 41:15.844
I love you, Daddy, but
this is no way to live.

41:19.915 --> 41:21.183
Pearl?

41:23.151 --> 41:24.619
What are you doing?

41:26.221 --> 41:28.023
Talking with Daddy.

41:31.693 --> 41:33.595
We need to get him
back to the house.

41:36.698 --> 41:38.133
Why do you hate me, Mama?

41:42.004 --> 41:43.972
I only want what's best.

41:46.842 --> 41:48.543
When do I get what I want?

41:51.947 --> 41:53.015
One day you'll understand

41:53.048 --> 41:56.051
that getting what you want
isn't what's important.

41:58.587 --> 42:00.622
Making the most
of what you have is.

42:01.857 --> 42:04.893
Life rarely turns out
how you expect.

42:04.926 --> 42:06.228
You need to be prepared for that

42:06.261 --> 42:07.996
if you ever want to be happy.

42:09.865 --> 42:11.099
Come back inside.

42:28.950 --> 42:30.652
Where are you?

43:44.793 --> 43:47.362
Stop staring at me.

44:48.957 --> 44:50.926
How'd you find that?

44:50.959 --> 44:54.095
I am not blind to
what goes on around here.

44:54.129 --> 44:56.464
Take your dinner.
Stay in the bunkhouse.

44:56.498 --> 44:58.133
But it's freezing out there!

44:58.166 --> 45:00.936
You should've thought of that
before putting me at risk.

45:00.969 --> 45:03.972
Isolate yourself until
we know you're not ill.

45:04.005 --> 45:05.273
That is what's right.

45:09.411 --> 45:12.013
There's a dance audition
in town tomorrow.

45:15.183 --> 45:16.918
I'm going to it.

45:16.952 --> 45:18.453
No, you're not.

45:18.486 --> 45:21.223
- Yes, I am.
- Why?

45:22.390 --> 45:24.292
Find out if I'm good enough.

45:25.293 --> 45:26.995
Good enough for what, Pearl?

45:32.033 --> 45:34.135
Something more than this.

45:37.806 --> 45:40.875
Where does all this
ungratefulness stem from?

45:40.909 --> 45:44.045
How is it you find our life
so beneath you?

45:44.079 --> 45:46.047
You've always had
a roof over your head,

45:46.081 --> 45:48.183
food in your belly.

45:48.216 --> 45:50.352
Do you not think that came
at great sacrifice

45:50.385 --> 45:52.320
from your father and I?

45:52.354 --> 45:55.457
Or do you think we are
beneath you, too?

45:55.490 --> 45:57.292
If I'm meant to live out
the rest of my days

45:57.325 --> 45:59.094
with you and Daddy on this farm,

45:59.127 --> 46:00.228
then so be it.

46:00.262 --> 46:02.931
But I'm only young once.

46:02.964 --> 46:05.834
If I go to this audition
and I don't get picked,

46:05.867 --> 46:07.068
then I'll come home

46:07.102 --> 46:10.338
and I'll never speak
of it again, I swear.

46:10.372 --> 46:12.073
But I have to know that I tried

46:12.107 --> 46:13.942
or I'm gonna regret it
for the rest of my life.

46:13.975 --> 46:16.811
Please, Mama. You have
no idea what I'm capable of.

46:18.581 --> 46:20.048
Oh, yes, I do.

46:21.483 --> 46:24.486
I've seen the things
you've done in private,

46:25.554 --> 46:27.222
when you believe
no one is watching.

46:28.624 --> 46:31.527
You think others won't notice?

46:31.560 --> 46:35.297
You can't keep your true
self hidden forever, Pearl.

46:35.330 --> 46:38.333
They will notice eventually,
and they will be frightened,

46:39.367 --> 46:40.802
just as I am.

46:42.304 --> 46:45.440
- You're wrong.
- Am I?

46:45.473 --> 46:49.444
Then what a
fine woman you hope to become,

46:49.477 --> 46:51.146
leaving your mother alone to rot

46:51.179 --> 46:54.215
so you can dance with
a bunch of city whores.

46:54.249 --> 46:57.085
Let alone the illness you may
contract and spread.

46:57.118 --> 46:59.020
You've seen what it does
to your father.

46:59.054 --> 47:01.056
That's what you want
for yourself and others?

47:01.089 --> 47:03.592
And maybe that is what
you wish for me.

47:03.626 --> 47:06.261
- Of course not.
- Stop lying!

47:06.294 --> 47:08.363
I can't stand
the sound of it anymore!

47:08.396 --> 47:12.000
It's almost as abhorrent
as your sinful behavior!

47:12.033 --> 47:15.236
You are not well, Pearl!

47:15.270 --> 47:17.906
It's only a matter of time
before you hurt someone else.

47:17.939 --> 47:22.210
Malevolence is festering
in you, I see it.

47:22.243 --> 47:24.379
And I will not,
in good conscious,

47:24.412 --> 47:26.281
let you leave this farm again.

47:27.449 --> 47:29.217
You can't stop me.

47:29.250 --> 47:30.919
Oh, yes, I can.

47:30.952 --> 47:33.622
You don't want to know
what I could do to you.

47:33.656 --> 47:37.660
I shoulder a burden
you will never understand,

47:37.693 --> 47:39.628
spend my days feeding
and wiping the snot

47:39.662 --> 47:41.930
off the face of the man
I married.

47:41.963 --> 47:45.266
You dare sit there and
talk to me about regret?

47:45.300 --> 47:48.370
I was supposed to be
his wife, not his mother!

47:48.403 --> 47:51.106
Don't you ever speak
that way to me again!

47:51.139 --> 47:52.474
Do you hear me?

47:53.408 --> 47:55.443
- I'm sorry.
- No! You're not!

47:55.477 --> 47:57.312
Or you would stop all this!

47:57.345 --> 47:58.947
Here! Take it!

47:58.980 --> 48:02.050
That's what you
really desire, isn't it?

48:02.083 --> 48:04.620
Perhaps I should
kill him for you?

48:04.653 --> 48:07.122
That way you don't have to
care for him any longer.

48:07.155 --> 48:10.125
Would that suit
your selfish dreams better?

48:10.158 --> 48:12.293
Then we can both
go to the dance audition!

48:12.327 --> 48:14.697
Your husband is gone.
So is mine.

48:14.730 --> 48:16.498
Why should we be saddled
with caring for them

48:16.532 --> 48:18.133
or the work of this farm?

48:18.166 --> 48:21.035
What about us
getting what we want?

48:29.077 --> 48:31.246
I won't suffer for you
any longer.

48:31.279 --> 48:34.482
You want to leave? Go.

48:34.517 --> 48:36.084
But when you fail...

48:37.485 --> 48:39.220
And you will fail...

48:40.556 --> 48:42.625
I want you to remember
what it feels like

48:44.092 --> 48:48.963
because that's how I feel
every time I look at you.

48:48.997 --> 48:53.067
Nearly everything I ever had
has been taken from me, Pearl.

48:55.303 --> 48:57.706
What more do you want?

48:57.740 --> 49:00.743
I just don't want to end up
like you, is all.

49:13.054 --> 49:15.356
I hate you!

49:17.325 --> 49:19.127
You harlot!

49:19.160 --> 49:21.463
I won't let you flaunt
your arrogance in my face!

49:21.496 --> 49:24.567
- You are not better than me!
- Yes, I am!

49:24.600 --> 49:26.735
I'm going to be a star!

49:26.769 --> 49:29.505
The whole world
is going to know my name!

52:06.595 --> 52:09.197
Where are you going?
It's not even 6:00 a.m. yet.

52:09.230 --> 52:10.833
I have to practice my routine.

52:10.866 --> 52:13.468
I need to be perfect
for my audition today.

52:16.437 --> 52:18.574
You still think
I'm pretty enough?

52:18.607 --> 52:20.909
Oh, not much has changed
in the last 24 hours.

52:20.943 --> 52:22.511
Yes, it has.

52:22.544 --> 52:25.380
Oh. You forgot this
last time.

52:26.982 --> 52:28.684
I'm glad you came back.

52:31.587 --> 52:33.522
So am I.

52:38.927 --> 52:40.663
Let me at least drive you home.

52:53.842 --> 52:55.443
Somebody you know?

52:58.614 --> 53:00.348
I'm not really sure.

53:01.016 --> 53:03.384
Well...

53:03.418 --> 53:04.920
It's hard to know
who anyone is nowadays

53:04.953 --> 53:06.822
with all these masks
people are wearing.

53:37.753 --> 53:38.854
Wait here a minute.

54:01.810 --> 54:03.946
Daddy, I'm so sorry.

54:25.399 --> 54:27.368
I'm going to get you
cleaned up real soon, okay?

54:27.401 --> 54:28.637
I just have a guest right now.

54:28.670 --> 54:30.539
Shh!

54:42.684 --> 54:44.787
Ah. Ah.

54:59.433 --> 55:00.434
Okay, come in!

55:18.821 --> 55:19.955
This is my father.

55:24.059 --> 55:25.594
Pleased to meet you, sir.

55:33.836 --> 55:35.604
Want to go up to my bedroom now?

55:42.410 --> 55:44.478
I want off this farm forever.

55:45.981 --> 55:48.083
I don't know.
It doesn't seem so bad.

55:49.718 --> 55:51.053
It is.

55:52.154 --> 55:55.123
What was that?

55:55.157 --> 55:57.626
Nothing.

55:57.659 --> 56:00.028
Tell me more about Europe.

56:00.896 --> 56:02.130
When can we go?

56:03.999 --> 56:06.001
Don't
you think you should go check?

56:07.002 --> 56:08.103
No.

56:10.606 --> 56:11.974
All right.
I'm sorry.

56:12.641 --> 56:13.675
Whatever that is,

56:13.709 --> 56:15.409
we can't just ignore it.

56:15.443 --> 56:16.912
It could be your father,
for Christ's sake.

56:16.945 --> 56:18.780
It's not my father.

56:18.814 --> 56:21.683
Please don't go.

56:23.218 --> 56:24.452
What's the matter with you?

56:25.954 --> 56:27.522
Nothing.

57:18.140 --> 57:20.075
It's our dog.

57:20.108 --> 57:21.910
She made a mess in the
kitchen while I was away,

57:21.944 --> 57:23.245
so I put her in the root cellar.

57:26.114 --> 57:27.616
I want to show you something.

57:34.656 --> 57:36.024
That's Charlie!

57:36.858 --> 57:39.127
She's always hungry.

57:39.161 --> 57:41.663
We can't afford to feed her
like we used to.

57:41.697 --> 57:44.733
And over here, this is Mary.

57:44.766 --> 57:46.034
Ain't she a dish?

57:46.568 --> 57:47.836
Mmm.

57:48.770 --> 57:50.238
This is Francis.

57:51.540 --> 57:53.241
They're my best audience.

57:53.275 --> 57:57.145
I named each of them after
my favorite picture stars.

57:57.179 --> 58:00.749
I've put on so many shows
for them over the years.

58:00.782 --> 58:02.818
It'll be sad to say goodbye,
but like they say,

58:02.851 --> 58:04.186
"If you're not moving forward
in show business,

58:04.219 --> 58:05.486
"you're moving backwards."

58:06.588 --> 58:08.590
We used to have
many more animals,

58:09.624 --> 58:10.826
but they all died.

58:11.994 --> 58:13.528
What about your dog?

58:13.562 --> 58:15.163
Huh?

58:15.197 --> 58:17.799
- What's its name?
- We don't have a dog.

58:19.568 --> 58:21.903
I thought you said you, uh, did?

58:21.937 --> 58:23.505
In the cellar?

58:24.740 --> 58:25.741
Oh.

58:26.842 --> 58:30.846
Right. Yeah.

58:30.879 --> 58:34.916
Yeah, well, um...

58:35.884 --> 58:38.553
Oh, boy.

58:38.587 --> 58:40.756
Oh, I better be getting back,
you know?

58:43.291 --> 58:44.926
- What?
- Oh, I've got to go

58:44.960 --> 58:46.094
and screen the matinee,
you know,

58:46.128 --> 58:47.729
but you gotta practice,
remember?

58:47.763 --> 58:49.264
You gotta get those
dance moves perfect.

58:50.232 --> 58:51.266
Now's not the time to be

58:51.299 --> 58:53.001
resting on your laurels, is it?

58:55.270 --> 58:56.905
Nice seeing you, Pearl.

59:00.275 --> 59:02.711
Did I do something wrong?

59:04.746 --> 59:05.747
No.

59:07.315 --> 59:09.785
Then why did you
just go cold on me?

59:12.020 --> 59:13.722
I don't know what you mean.

59:14.222 --> 59:15.891
What did you see?

59:17.092 --> 59:18.660
I didn't see anything.

59:20.862 --> 59:22.864
You're lying.

59:22.898 --> 59:25.033
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

59:26.768 --> 59:29.671
I know because I
feel things very deeply.

59:31.139 --> 59:32.808
Look, I've got to get back
to work, all right?

59:32.841 --> 59:34.242
- I'll... I'll see you later.
- When?

59:34.276 --> 59:36.711
- What?
- When will I see you?

59:36.745 --> 59:37.779
I don't know, Pearl.
It's just an expression.

59:37.813 --> 59:39.147
You're not going to take
me to Europe, are you?

59:39.181 --> 59:40.182
Tell me the truth.

59:42.818 --> 59:44.152
What did I do wrong?

59:44.186 --> 59:45.353
- Nothing. Calm down.
- No!

59:45.387 --> 59:48.123
Why are you leaving me if
I didn't do anything wrong?

59:48.156 --> 59:50.192
I don't understand!
I thought you liked me!

59:50.225 --> 59:53.328
- I do like you. I just...
- Tell me the truth!

59:53.361 --> 59:54.896
Why are you leaving me?
What did you see?

59:54.930 --> 59:55.997
Why did you change?

59:56.031 --> 59:57.866
You're scaring me, Pearl.

59:58.934 --> 01:00:00.168
Okay?

01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:04.873
I wish you the best of luck
with your audition.

01:00:04.906 --> 01:00:06.108
Sincerely.

01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:31.066
You're not gonna leave me here!

01:00:31.099 --> 01:00:34.002
I'm not staying on this farm!

01:00:36.872 --> 01:00:39.774
Nothing's going to keep me here!

01:00:47.983 --> 01:00:50.819
You hear me?

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:53.922
Nothing!

01:00:57.125 --> 01:00:59.461
Not you! Not Howard!

01:00:59.494 --> 01:01:02.297
Not Mama! Nobody!

01:01:10.906 --> 01:01:12.440
No. No.

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:34.229
I want you to remember
what it feels like.

01:01:37.065 --> 01:01:39.935
'Cause that's how I felt
every time you looked at me.

01:01:46.241 --> 01:01:48.343
Okay, Daddy.

01:01:48.376 --> 01:01:50.011
Let's get you cleaned up.

01:02:20.576 --> 01:02:23.311
I wish you wouldn't
look at me like that.

01:02:57.245 --> 01:02:58.413
What do you think?

01:03:28.644 --> 01:03:30.979
Thank you for everything.

01:03:32.447 --> 01:03:35.317
I know you'll look down
on me proudly.

01:03:42.891 --> 01:03:44.426
You are loved.

01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:08.316
<i>Au revoir,</i> poor Johnny!

01:04:50.091 --> 01:04:52.327
Oh, thank goodness you came.

01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:54.262
I was beginning to think
you weren't going to show.

01:04:54.295 --> 01:04:55.997
Sorry.

01:04:56.030 --> 01:04:58.199
I had some chores to do
around the house.

01:04:58.233 --> 01:05:00.935
Well, I've been in
such a flap all by myself.

01:05:00.969 --> 01:05:02.470
I feel worse
than I imagine I would

01:05:02.505 --> 01:05:04.607
had I contracted that awful flu.

01:05:06.307 --> 01:05:08.176
What's in the suitcases?

01:05:08.209 --> 01:05:10.412
All my things I need
for going on the road.

01:05:10.445 --> 01:05:12.648
Wow.
You're confident.

01:05:14.583 --> 01:05:18.153
Rumor has it they may only be
taking one gal per town.

01:05:20.188 --> 01:05:21.456
It has to be me.

01:05:24.993 --> 01:05:28.196
I don't think you meant
to say that out loud, Pearl.

01:05:28.229 --> 01:05:31.232
Well, if it's not me, then
I hope it's you, right?

01:05:31.767 --> 01:05:33.268
It has to be me.

01:05:38.473 --> 01:05:39.708
Next.

01:05:52.387 --> 01:05:54.022
That's Dorothy Collins.

01:05:57.225 --> 01:05:59.461
Can't say I'm too
saddened for her.

01:05:59.494 --> 01:06:03.064
Some people just think
they're God's gift, you know?

01:06:03.097 --> 01:06:05.701
But they always get what's
coming to them eventually.

01:06:09.471 --> 01:06:11.272
I feel bad saying that,
actually.

01:06:11.306 --> 01:06:13.374
She's a nurse.

01:06:13.408 --> 01:06:15.744
I don't know how to do
something like that.

01:06:15.778 --> 01:06:18.179
Oh, Pearl.
I'm so nervous.

01:06:18.213 --> 01:06:20.081
What if they laugh me
right off stage?

01:06:20.114 --> 01:06:21.717
I don't think
I could handle that.

01:06:24.285 --> 01:06:25.754
How are you not scared?

01:06:28.223 --> 01:06:30.659
I guess I'm just more
used to the feeling.

01:06:36.331 --> 01:06:37.499
Next.

01:06:53.616 --> 01:06:55.149
Oh, Lord.

01:07:04.158 --> 01:07:06.094
Switch places with me.

01:07:06.127 --> 01:07:08.229
I don't think I can do this.
I'm too frightened.

01:07:08.263 --> 01:07:10.164
- What?
- Come on, Pearl.

01:07:10.198 --> 01:07:12.668
Switch before they open
the doors again.

01:07:13.636 --> 01:07:16.070
Come on. Move.

01:07:20.676 --> 01:07:22.511
Thank you.

01:07:23.444 --> 01:07:25.046
You're a good friend.

01:07:30.184 --> 01:07:31.352
Am I?

01:07:33.722 --> 01:07:35.089
Of course you are.

01:07:41.462 --> 01:07:43.699
Sister-in-laws have to
stick together, right?

01:08:12.193 --> 01:08:13.361
Next.

01:08:14.262 --> 01:08:16.130
Your turn, Pearl.

01:08:16.163 --> 01:08:18.567
Time to show them
what you can do.

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:20.234
I'm gonna show them all.

01:08:20.935 --> 01:08:22.403
Break a leg.

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:26.935
Ready, miss?

01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:26.622
Thank you.

01:11:28.557 --> 01:11:29.958
But it's gonna be a no.

01:11:45.641 --> 01:11:47.910
Pardon?

01:11:47.943 --> 01:11:50.879
Sorry, you're just not
what we had in mind.

01:12:00.055 --> 01:12:02.524
Well, that was the best
dancing I've ever done.

01:12:03.926 --> 01:12:06.995
Yes, it was very nice.

01:12:07.029 --> 01:12:10.699
But we already have plenty
of gals like you in the troupe.

01:12:10.732 --> 01:12:13.669
We're looking for
something different today.

01:12:13.702 --> 01:12:18.140
You know?
More all-American,

01:12:18.173 --> 01:12:19.875
younger and blonde.

01:12:21.543 --> 01:12:23.411
Someone with X factor.

01:12:26.949 --> 01:12:28.050
What?

01:12:30.786 --> 01:12:31.920
Next!

01:12:37.893 --> 01:12:39.427
Come on.

01:12:40.062 --> 01:12:41.429
- Come on.
- No.

01:12:42.496 --> 01:12:45.167
I'm afraid so.

01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:47.703
Come on, miss.
Time to go.

01:12:52.708 --> 01:12:54.843
Please.

01:12:54.877 --> 01:12:56.979
You don't understand.
I need this.

01:12:57.012 --> 01:13:00.448
Next in line, please.

01:13:00.481 --> 01:13:01.950
I can make it better.

01:13:01.984 --> 01:13:03.085
Come on now, darling.

01:13:03.118 --> 01:13:06.021
You don't want to make a scene
and spoil everything.

01:13:06.054 --> 01:13:09.024
Please! Just give me
one more chance.

01:13:10.491 --> 01:13:11.994
- Come on, now.
- No.

01:13:12.928 --> 01:13:14.495
I'm a... I'm a star.

01:13:15.731 --> 01:13:18.567
Come on.
Come on, miss. I'm sorry.

01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:20.836
- It's time to go.
- No, I'm a star!

01:13:20.869 --> 01:13:21.937
Come on.

01:13:23.772 --> 01:13:28.442
Please! I'm a star!

01:13:28.476 --> 01:13:30.112
I'm sorry. It's time to go.

01:13:30.145 --> 01:13:32.547
Please, somebody help me!

01:13:32.581 --> 01:13:36.084
Please! Help me!
Help me!

01:13:37.686 --> 01:13:39.420
No!

01:14:17.192 --> 01:14:18.492
Pearl?

01:14:20.929 --> 01:14:22.064
Pearl?

01:14:26.835 --> 01:14:28.603
How about I take you home?

01:14:58.233 --> 01:14:59.868
Is that our pig?

01:15:18.587 --> 01:15:20.088
Should I go
and fetch your mother?

01:15:21.623 --> 01:15:23.058
No.

01:15:29.297 --> 01:15:31.867
How about I get you
something nice to drink?

01:15:34.836 --> 01:15:36.204
Mama was right.

01:15:38.340 --> 01:15:40.575
I'm never getting off this farm.

01:15:41.710 --> 01:15:43.078
And where would you want to go?

01:15:44.379 --> 01:15:46.214
- Europe.
- Europe?

01:15:46.248 --> 01:15:48.717
What on earth for?

01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:49.885
It'll be in ruins

01:15:49.918 --> 01:15:52.220
and you'll never get Howard
back there, I'll tell you.

01:15:54.790 --> 01:15:56.158
Oh, come on, now.

01:15:56.191 --> 01:15:57.159
I know you're disappointed,

01:15:57.192 --> 01:15:59.828
but there's no sense
in taking it this hard.

01:15:59.861 --> 01:16:02.130
It's just a lousy
old church group.

01:16:02.164 --> 01:16:04.666
Those old dolts,

01:16:04.699 --> 01:16:08.804
they don't know the first
thing about quality dancing.

01:16:09.871 --> 01:16:11.907
You don't understand.

01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:13.308
What don't I?

01:16:13.975 --> 01:16:15.110
Come on, Pearl.

01:16:15.977 --> 01:16:17.145
What's really the matter?

01:16:20.382 --> 01:16:22.117
I don't feel

01:16:23.418 --> 01:16:24.786
well.

01:16:27.656 --> 01:16:29.357
You're not coming down
with something, are you?

01:16:29.391 --> 01:16:30.926
No.

01:16:30.959 --> 01:16:32.194
It's nothing like that.

01:16:32.227 --> 01:16:33.795
Oh, thank goodness.

01:16:33.829 --> 01:16:35.130
If I snuck out of the house

01:16:35.163 --> 01:16:38.033
and ended up bringing home
nothing but the germ,

01:16:38.066 --> 01:16:40.836
my mother and father
would just kill me.

01:16:42.938 --> 01:16:44.806
I'm worried there
may be something

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:46.775
real wrong with me, Mitsy.

01:16:48.977 --> 01:16:50.011
How do you mean?

01:16:51.213 --> 01:16:53.715
Seems like there's
something missing in me

01:16:53.748 --> 01:16:55.784
that the rest of the world has.

01:16:57.319 --> 01:16:58.820
Have you told Howard?

01:17:00.689 --> 01:17:04.426
I've never spoken about it
out loud to anyone.

01:17:04.459 --> 01:17:07.362
So afraid of
what people might think.

01:17:07.395 --> 01:17:08.763
Pearl...

01:17:10.232 --> 01:17:12.134
Howard's your husband.

01:17:13.401 --> 01:17:15.170
He adores you.

01:17:15.203 --> 01:17:17.873
You shouldn't be afraid
to tell him how you feel.

01:17:19.141 --> 01:17:21.710
I'm scared of what I might say.

01:17:21.743 --> 01:17:24.112
Well, practice
on me first, then.

01:17:24.813 --> 01:17:26.281
Pretend I'm Howard,

01:17:26.314 --> 01:17:29.117
and you just say
whatever's on your mind.

01:17:29.151 --> 01:17:31.052
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:33.188
Go on. Get it all out.

01:17:35.023 --> 01:17:37.259
- Really?
- Yes.

01:17:37.959 --> 01:17:38.994
Trust me.

01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:52.774
Howard...

01:17:59.314 --> 01:18:00.448
Go ahead, Pearl.

01:18:07.289 --> 01:18:09.925
I hate you so much
for leaving me here,

01:18:09.958 --> 01:18:11.893
sometimes I hope you die.

01:18:15.096 --> 01:18:17.432
I'm sorry.

01:18:17.465 --> 01:18:20.435
I feel awful admitting that,
but it's the truth.

01:18:23.438 --> 01:18:24.806
I was curious

01:18:26.107 --> 01:18:27.309
about other men.

01:18:29.177 --> 01:18:30.812
I'm sure you don't
want to hear about

01:18:30.845 --> 01:18:32.447
a stranger satisfying your wife,

01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:34.382
and I swear it was only once.

01:18:35.050 --> 01:18:36.985
It was a mistake.

01:18:37.018 --> 01:18:39.988
It wasn't him that I
wanted. I know that now.

01:18:40.021 --> 01:18:41.756
And I wish things
could just go back

01:18:41.790 --> 01:18:43.191
to the way they were before,

01:18:43.225 --> 01:18:45.060
but I don't see how they could,

01:18:46.995 --> 01:18:48.964
not after the things I've done.

01:18:52.568 --> 01:18:55.170
What else have you done, Pearl?

01:18:55.203 --> 01:18:57.172
Oh, Howard.

01:18:57.205 --> 01:18:59.508
I realize
how this all must sound.

01:19:00.976 --> 01:19:03.078
Honestly, there was a time
I was flattered

01:19:03.111 --> 01:19:06.081
to have someone as
handsome as you pine over me.

01:19:06.114 --> 01:19:08.250
You're such a good person.
I know that.

01:19:09.552 --> 01:19:12.487
I made sure to always be
mindful with your heart.

01:19:12.521 --> 01:19:15.023
I never wanted you
to feel jealous.

01:19:16.358 --> 01:19:18.493
It's an awful feeling
like a rot,

01:19:18.527 --> 01:19:22.430
the way it just twists
and turns at your insides.

01:19:22.464 --> 01:19:24.533
I know that aching so well.

01:19:25.133 --> 01:19:27.369
I feel it.

01:19:27.402 --> 01:19:30.939
Whenever I see others
whose lives come easy

01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:35.210
because the truth is,
I'm not really a good person.

01:19:36.512 --> 01:19:37.680
Pearl, I think I should just...

01:19:37.713 --> 01:19:40.415
The reason I kept my eyes to
the ground around other men

01:19:40.448 --> 01:19:42.217
was never to avoid hurting you.

01:19:44.319 --> 01:19:46.488
It's because I understood
how lucky I was

01:19:46.522 --> 01:19:48.890
to have your attention.

01:19:48.923 --> 01:19:52.460
I may be a poor farm girl,
Howard, but I'm not stupid.

01:19:52.494 --> 01:19:56.164
I spotted you the moment
you came to live with us.

01:19:56.197 --> 01:19:58.300
You worked hard
like the other farmhands,

01:19:58.333 --> 01:20:00.068
but you were different.

01:20:00.101 --> 01:20:02.137
You're from somewhere.

01:20:02.170 --> 01:20:03.905
A nice, comfortable place

01:20:03.938 --> 01:20:06.308
that you could return to
whenever you wanted.

01:20:08.577 --> 01:20:10.912
I'm so desperate to have that.

01:20:12.881 --> 01:20:15.016
All my life,
I've wanted off this farm

01:20:15.050 --> 01:20:16.985
and you were my ticket out.

01:20:18.253 --> 01:20:19.854
So...

01:20:19.888 --> 01:20:23.258
I made sure to never let you
see who I really was.

01:20:23.291 --> 01:20:25.860
It worked like a charm, too.

01:20:25.894 --> 01:20:28.263
Then when you finally
brought me back

01:20:28.296 --> 01:20:30.065
to your home
to meet your family,

01:20:30.098 --> 01:20:31.534
it was just as I hoped.

01:20:33.335 --> 01:20:35.403
A life straight
out of the pictures.

01:20:37.272 --> 01:20:39.407
At least that's what
it felt like to me.

01:20:42.043 --> 01:20:43.211
And you didn't want it.

01:20:46.549 --> 01:20:48.316
You just wanted
to stay here on our farm,

01:20:48.350 --> 01:20:50.185
and that made me so angry.

01:20:51.319 --> 01:20:52.655
How could you?

01:20:52.688 --> 01:20:55.890
I'm certain you knew
I hated it, you must've.

01:20:55.924 --> 01:20:57.992
How could you be
so selfish and cruel

01:20:58.026 --> 01:21:00.061
after all I've done
to make you happy?

01:21:05.433 --> 01:21:08.136
I was even pregnant
with your baby.

01:21:12.941 --> 01:21:16.277
I never wanted to be a mother.

01:21:16.311 --> 01:21:19.981
I loathed the feeling of it
growing inside me.

01:21:20.014 --> 01:21:21.584
It felt like sickness.

01:21:23.652 --> 01:21:27.556
Pulling and sucking on me like
some needy animal in a barn.

01:21:29.324 --> 01:21:31.594
How could I be responsible
for another life?

01:21:32.561 --> 01:21:34.462
Life terrifies me.

01:21:34.496 --> 01:21:37.332
It's harsh, and bleak,
and draining.

01:21:39.602 --> 01:21:42.070
I was so relieved when it died.

01:21:42.103 --> 01:21:44.038
It was one less weight
keeping me trapped here,

01:21:44.072 --> 01:21:46.509
but then the war came
and you left me, too.

01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:49.645
Why did you leave me, Howard?

01:21:56.217 --> 01:21:58.052
I hate feeling like this.

01:21:58.621 --> 01:22:01.022
So pathetic.

01:22:01.055 --> 01:22:03.425
Do people like you
ever feel this way?

01:22:04.159 --> 01:22:05.293
I figure you don't.

01:22:05.326 --> 01:22:07.462
You seem so perfect
all the time.

01:22:07.495 --> 01:22:10.131
Lord must've been
generous to you.

01:22:10.165 --> 01:22:12.568
He never answers
any of my prayers.

01:22:12.601 --> 01:22:15.103
I don't know why.
What did I do?

01:22:15.136 --> 01:22:17.205
What is wrong with me?

01:22:17.238 --> 01:22:19.441
Please, just tell me
so maybe I can get better.

01:22:19.474 --> 01:22:21.042
I don't want to end up
like Mama.

01:22:21.075 --> 01:22:22.745
I want to be dancing up
on the screen

01:22:22.778 --> 01:22:24.979
like the pretty gals
in the pictures.

01:22:26.314 --> 01:22:29.017
I want what they have so badly,

01:22:29.050 --> 01:22:30.586
to be perfect,

01:22:30.619 --> 01:22:33.288
to be loved from
as many people as possible

01:22:33.321 --> 01:22:36.057
to make up for all my time
spent suffering.

01:22:38.761 --> 01:22:40.729
Sometimes I wake
in the middle of the night

01:22:40.763 --> 01:22:43.699
and the fear washes over me,
'cause what if this is it?

01:22:46.067 --> 01:22:47.703
What if this is
right where I belong?

01:22:53.441 --> 01:22:54.610
I'm a failure.

01:22:56.044 --> 01:22:57.178
I'm not pretty

01:22:58.681 --> 01:23:01.115
or naturally pleasant,
or friendly.

01:23:01.717 --> 01:23:03.184
I'm not smart,

01:23:03.819 --> 01:23:05.621
or funny, or confident.

01:23:08.056 --> 01:23:10.458
I'm exactly what Mama said
I was, weak.

01:23:11.794 --> 01:23:14.195
I don't know why.
What did I do?

01:23:14.229 --> 01:23:16.064
Why wasn't my family like yours?

01:23:16.097 --> 01:23:19.133
I hate what it feels like
to be me and not you.

01:23:19.167 --> 01:23:21.102
I'm so scared that
when you finally come home,

01:23:21.135 --> 01:23:22.403
you'll see me and be frightened

01:23:22.437 --> 01:23:24.172
like everyone else is.

01:23:27.442 --> 01:23:29.477
I know what I've done,

01:23:29.512 --> 01:23:30.713
the bad things,

01:23:31.747 --> 01:23:36.150
terrible, awful,
murderous things.

01:23:36.184 --> 01:23:38.621
I regret them now,
but I liked how they felt.

01:23:38.654 --> 01:23:40.488
I wish I didn't, but I did.

01:23:42.290 --> 01:23:45.426
At first, it was only animals
smaller than myself.

01:23:46.361 --> 01:23:47.462
Nothing with feelings.

01:23:47.495 --> 01:23:49.063
Nothing that could hurt me back.

01:23:50.298 --> 01:23:51.399
It felt good.

01:23:52.467 --> 01:23:54.269
Killing's easier than you think,

01:23:55.671 --> 01:23:57.105
till recently with Mama

01:23:57.138 --> 01:23:58.541
and the boy
from the picture house.

01:23:58.574 --> 01:23:59.642
They were different.

01:24:00.441 --> 01:24:02.277
They were more meaningful.

01:24:02.310 --> 01:24:04.145
I hurt them
so they too might know

01:24:04.178 --> 01:24:05.280
what it feels like to suffer,

01:24:05.313 --> 01:24:06.782
but poor Daddy
didn't deserve that.

01:24:06.815 --> 01:24:09.083
I wish I hadn't done what I did.

01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:13.221
Mama meant well.

01:24:14.389 --> 01:24:16.659
She had a hard life.

01:24:16.692 --> 01:24:18.493
She only wanted a home
to feel safe in.

01:24:18.527 --> 01:24:19.628
I can see that.

01:24:20.495 --> 01:24:21.564
I thought I hated her,

01:24:21.597 --> 01:24:23.364
but I just want to
feel safe, too.

01:24:28.336 --> 01:24:29.404
Lord...

01:24:30.673 --> 01:24:33.542
I made such a mess of things.

01:24:34.743 --> 01:24:36.812
I don't know how much more
I can take.

01:24:38.681 --> 01:24:40.181
I need to clean this up.

01:24:41.316 --> 01:24:43.552
All of it.

01:24:43.586 --> 01:24:46.522
I need to make things right
before you see me again.

01:24:48.222 --> 01:24:49.858
Maybe if I can turn this farm

01:24:49.892 --> 01:24:51.627
into a home for us
like you wanted,

01:24:51.660 --> 01:24:53.494
things will finally
be different.

01:24:53.529 --> 01:24:56.264
I can forgive.

01:24:57.165 --> 01:24:58.767
I can be who you want me to be

01:24:59.635 --> 01:25:01.369
if you'll just stay with me.

01:25:02.771 --> 01:25:04.506
Would you do that, please?

01:25:07.375 --> 01:25:09.344
I can't be
all by myself anymore.

01:25:09.377 --> 01:25:10.445
It's too hard.

01:25:14.917 --> 01:25:16.752
We can love each other.

01:25:16.785 --> 01:25:18.721
I'll do that for you

01:25:18.754 --> 01:25:21.890
if you really meant all that
"till death do us part."

01:25:24.192 --> 01:25:25.426
It'd be enough,

01:25:27.428 --> 01:25:30.298
just you and me
here on this farm.

01:25:36.905 --> 01:25:39.273
All I really want
is to be loved.

01:25:42.911 --> 01:25:45.614
I'm having such a hard time
without it lately.

01:26:22.518 --> 01:26:25.319
I should probably get going now.

01:26:25.353 --> 01:26:28.356
Mother will be wondering
where I am if I'm not home soon.

01:26:37.298 --> 01:26:38.767
Are you frightened of me?

01:26:40.836 --> 01:26:41.837
No.

01:26:44.973 --> 01:26:46.307
Of course not, Pearl.

01:26:49.878 --> 01:26:51.479
Do you think I'm sick?

01:26:53.582 --> 01:26:54.583
No.

01:26:56.819 --> 01:26:57.820
Thank you.

01:27:01.724 --> 01:27:03.391
I'm happy for you.

01:27:06.695 --> 01:27:08.296
What?

01:27:08.329 --> 01:27:09.497
For getting the part

01:27:10.532 --> 01:27:12.668
in the dance troupe.
You deserved it.

01:27:14.837 --> 01:27:17.606
- I didn't get the part.
- It's okay.

01:27:18.774 --> 01:27:20.008
You don't have to
pretend anymore.

01:27:20.042 --> 01:27:21.610
My feelings won't be hurt.

01:27:23.011 --> 01:27:25.246
If it wasn't me, I'm glad
it was you, right?

01:27:28.483 --> 01:27:30.552
- But, Pearl, I...
- Please...

01:27:32.020 --> 01:27:33.421
Don't lie to me.

01:27:40.095 --> 01:27:42.931
Well, yes.

01:27:45.501 --> 01:27:46.668
Thank you.

01:27:49.671 --> 01:27:51.573
It's going to be real swell,

01:27:52.641 --> 01:27:54.643
dancing around the state.

01:27:57.846 --> 01:28:01.449
I hope you can come
see the show sometime.

01:28:05.087 --> 01:28:07.321
You always get
everything you want.

01:28:09.758 --> 01:28:11.827
You're younger and more blonde.

01:28:14.029 --> 01:28:16.665
I have to go now.

01:28:20.636 --> 01:28:22.938
You're not gonna
say anything, are you?

01:28:24.673 --> 01:28:25.841
No.

01:28:32.514 --> 01:28:34.750
I really do love Howard.

01:28:37.586 --> 01:28:38.754
I know.

01:28:39.922 --> 01:28:41.489
Nobody has to know.

01:28:42.524 --> 01:28:43.792
I can fix things.

01:28:45.426 --> 01:28:47.596
It can be our secret, Mitsy.

01:29:38.647 --> 01:29:39.915
Help!

01:29:41.116 --> 01:29:42.450
Help me!

01:29:43.218 --> 01:29:45.654
Somebody, please help!

01:29:45.687 --> 01:29:47.623
No!

01:29:48.123 --> 01:29:49.591
No, please.

01:29:49.625 --> 01:29:51.727
Help! Help!

01:30:03.505 --> 01:30:05.439
Help!

01:30:08.043 --> 01:30:09.811
Help me, please!

01:30:09.845 --> 01:30:11.647
Help!

01:30:20.756 --> 01:30:22.791
Please, no! No!

01:30:23.558 --> 01:30:24.860
I won't tell anyone!

01:30:24.893 --> 01:30:26.460
Please, I swear!

01:30:26.828 --> 01:30:28.563
No!

01:30:28.597 --> 01:30:32.100
Please! I'll do anything
you want.

01:30:32.134 --> 01:30:35.203
It's not about
what I want anymore, Mitsy.

01:30:35.237 --> 01:30:36.171
Please.

01:30:36.204 --> 01:30:38.907
It's about making the best
of what I have.

01:30:38.941 --> 01:30:41.777
No! No!

01:30:42.945 --> 01:30:44.713
No!

01:33:50.398 --> 01:33:52.767
Bless us, O' Lord,

01:33:52.801 --> 01:33:55.437
and these thy gifts

01:33:55.470 --> 01:33:59.207
which we are about to receive
from thy bounty,

01:34:01.042 --> 01:34:02.944
through Christ our Lord.

01:34:04.312 --> 01:34:05.747
Amen.

01:34:45.754 --> 01:34:47.055
So long, y'all.

01:35:05.140 --> 01:35:06.274
Pearl?

01:35:12.515 --> 01:35:13.748
Pearl?

01:35:35.937 --> 01:35:36.938
Howard?

01:35:40.175 --> 01:35:42.511
I'm so happy you're home.
