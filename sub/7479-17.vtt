WEBVTT

00:22.023 --> 00:23.581
- Morning, ladies.
- Hey.

00:26.093 --> 00:27.185
Look back?

00:30.364 --> 00:31.388
There it is.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.499
God, I love L.A. Whoo.

00:36.003 --> 00:37.527
- Morning.
- Hey.

00:52.820 --> 00:55.050
Oh, Frank.

00:55.222 --> 00:56.553
Five miles today, buddy.

00:57.425 --> 01:01.191
That's a lie, I did three.
But I could have done five.

01:01.395 --> 01:04.227
This coffee just like I like it?

01:04.397 --> 01:06.525
Cold and stale?

01:15.276 --> 01:17.608
Got a question for you, Frank.

01:17.778 --> 01:19.803
What's the deal
with these Funyuns?

01:19.980 --> 01:22.540
Why are they more expensive
than Cheetos?

01:22.716 --> 01:24.445
They putting, uh, real fun in there?

01:28.622 --> 01:30.419
Turn over!

01:32.126 --> 01:33.457
Stay down!

01:33.661 --> 01:35.458
Behind you.

02:14.835 --> 02:17.998
Boom. Iceland, here I come.

02:18.172 --> 02:20.402
Why on earth would you
wanna go to Iceland?

02:20.608 --> 02:23.600
Because I'll have worked everywhere
there's been a James Bond film.

02:25.146 --> 02:27.979
You'll have worked everywhere
there has been a James Bond film?

02:28.182 --> 02:29.513
Everywhere except Iceland.

02:32.353 --> 02:34.014
Dr. No?

02:34.188 --> 02:38.522
Uh, Kingston, Crab Key, England
and Jamaica.

02:40.561 --> 02:41.994
License to Kill.

02:42.163 --> 02:48.568
Uh, Key West, Bimini Islands,
Isthmus City, The Bahamas.

02:48.736 --> 02:51.296
Now all I gotta do is convince Hetty
to send us to Iceland.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.431
To send you to Iceland.

02:55.743 --> 02:58.541
- What about Moonraker?
- What about it?

02:58.746 --> 03:00.680
Didn't they go into outer space
in Moonraker?

03:04.051 --> 03:06.042
Iceland and outer space.

03:06.253 --> 03:08.221
Good luck with that one.

03:08.455 --> 03:11.015
Oh, it never fails. Oh, it never fails.

03:11.225 --> 03:12.988
No matter how haggard you look
at the gym,

03:13.194 --> 03:16.027
some guy is gonna hit on you.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.360
What is that?

03:18.532 --> 03:21.262
- Is that a humble brag?
- A what?

03:21.502 --> 03:23.993
You feign complaining
while patting yourself on the back.

03:24.205 --> 03:25.399
No, I don't.

03:25.606 --> 03:28.769
No, what you're really saying is,
even at your worst, people hit on you.

03:29.777 --> 03:32.457
- No, that's not what I'm...
- It's like me saying, "I can't believe

03:32.613 --> 03:35.173
the referee tripped over my feet
at the Lakers game."

03:35.349 --> 03:37.249
Whoa, that is not what I was saying.

03:37.418 --> 03:38.885
Morning, Hetty.

03:41.522 --> 03:44.252
Deeks has been shot.

03:46.427 --> 03:47.917
How is he?

03:48.095 --> 03:50.996
He's in surgery
at Pacific Beach Medical.

03:51.198 --> 03:52.256
When?

03:52.433 --> 03:58.702
This morning at Sandune Convenience
Store on Culver Boulevard.

03:58.906 --> 03:59.930
Let's take my car.

04:00.441 --> 04:04.002
I said Mr. Deeks is in surgery.

04:04.211 --> 04:08.443
I think your particular skills would be
better served at the crime scene.

04:08.649 --> 04:10.048
Hetty, uh...

04:12.586 --> 04:15.749
Deeks is my second partner
to get shot.

04:16.322 --> 04:18.086
So I would really like to be there.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.592
Look, last time I wasn't there
for my partner.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.253
He was dead
the next time I saw him.

04:24.431 --> 04:25.921
So please, okay?

04:26.133 --> 04:31.230
I think your partner would want you
there when he wakes up.

04:35.909 --> 04:38.537
- Keep us posted.
- Okay.

04:39.079 --> 04:40.637
Thank you.

04:49.556 --> 04:52.457
- Agent Hanna, NCIS.
- Detective Versey.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.355
- Callen.
- What do you have so far?

04:54.595 --> 04:56.586
Well, it looks like he walked in
on a robbery.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.789
A dozen robberies like this
every week for the last month.

04:59.967 --> 05:03.596
- Not like this one.
- This time it was one of ours.

05:03.771 --> 05:05.534
Well, it looks cut and dry.

05:05.706 --> 05:09.506
But under the circumstances, I'd
be happy to let you guys run with it.

05:10.177 --> 05:13.578
Let me know what you find or
if there is anything we can do to help.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.189
Comes with the territory, right?

05:31.131 --> 05:32.621
You're the owner?

05:32.800 --> 05:36.167
I can't believe it.
Marty was such a nice guy.

05:36.370 --> 05:38.634
- Still is.
- What happened?

05:39.239 --> 05:41.332
Two guys come in.
One goes to the back.

05:41.508 --> 05:44.136
The other pulls a gun,
made me empty the register.

05:44.345 --> 05:46.210
Did you get a good look at him?

05:46.380 --> 05:48.507
I was focused on the gun
in my face.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.081
What can you tell us?

05:50.250 --> 05:52.514
They wouldn't leave
after I gave them the money.

05:52.686 --> 05:55.814
The one guy,
he kept glancing out the window.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.718
Checking to see
if it was safe to leave.

05:57.925 --> 05:59.358
That's when Marty came in.

05:59.526 --> 06:03.622
Coffee, newspaper,
always with a joke, every day.

06:04.331 --> 06:06.697
Gonna need to see
your surveillance tapes.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.858
It's a new digital system.

06:09.036 --> 06:12.267
I haven't quite figured out
how to use it.

06:14.775 --> 06:17.539
Eric, you got any cameras in the area
we can look at?

06:17.745 --> 06:19.007
On it.

06:19.179 --> 06:20.203
Any word on Deeks?

06:20.381 --> 06:22.508
Kensi still hasn't checked in
from the hospital.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.081
No news is good news, right?

06:26.253 --> 06:28.278
No word on Deeks.

06:31.425 --> 06:32.687
Why leave a witness?

06:32.893 --> 06:35.088
Why not shoot them both?

06:35.462 --> 06:36.520
Robbery is one thing

06:36.697 --> 06:39.564
but it takes a cold-hearted person
to kill someone in cold blood.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.860
Maybe Versey is right.

06:42.035 --> 06:46.734
A couple of wannabes got in
over their head, got scared and bailed.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.431
Maybe.

06:49.676 --> 06:51.268
You all right?

06:53.113 --> 06:56.082
Deeks is a pain in the ass,
but he doesn't deserve this.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.218
No one does.

07:16.804 --> 07:18.237
- How's he doing?
- Two shots.

07:18.405 --> 07:20.896
Worst was high in the chest.
Luckily, it missed his lung.

07:21.074 --> 07:23.634
Second fractured a rib,
deflected away from the heart.

07:23.811 --> 07:25.802
It was a small-caliber weapon.
He's gonna be okay.

07:25.979 --> 07:28.072
You can talk to him
when the anesthetic wears off.

07:28.248 --> 07:30.409
Uh, the nurse mentioned
there's no next of kin listed.

07:30.584 --> 07:32.609
Is there someone you can call?

07:34.588 --> 07:36.112
I don't know.

07:36.323 --> 07:39.918
The cameras were too far away
for an ID, but they do tell us

07:40.093 --> 07:43.290
that the men spent seven minutes
in the store before Deeks entered.

07:43.497 --> 07:45.089
I'm pulling up the traffic-cam footage

07:45.265 --> 07:48.291
for the nearest intersection
for the same time.

07:48.469 --> 07:49.936
Same gray Mustang.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.434
That's them.

07:52.239 --> 07:55.606
- No clear angle for an ID.
- Why so long in the store?

07:55.776 --> 07:57.607
Seven minutes?
That's an eternity for a heist.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.472
Get in, take the cash, get out.

07:59.646 --> 08:03.844
Mr. Beale, would you pull up
1894 Parkson Avenue?

08:04.051 --> 08:06.485
Traffic cam at the west end
of the street.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.484
What are we looking at here?

08:08.655 --> 08:11.385
Footage from an hour
before the shooting, please.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.753
That's Deeks' place.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.892
Just pulled that address
off the top of your head?

08:19.132 --> 08:23.000
I wouldn't be doing my job
if I didn't keep track of my agents.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.570
And by the way,
you're over-watering your lawn.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.832
I prefer a lush lawn.

08:29.409 --> 08:30.569
Eric, stop.

08:30.811 --> 08:34.144
Back up the video.
Zoom in and enhance the bottom left.

08:34.313 --> 08:35.645
Gray Mustang.

08:37.583 --> 08:39.779
Those guys in the Mustang
were waiting for him.

08:39.986 --> 08:42.352
Deeks didn't stumble on any robbery.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.924
He was ambushed.

09:20.459 --> 09:22.222
- Callen.
- How is he doing?

09:22.428 --> 09:24.521
He's out of surgery,
doctor says he's gonna be okay.

09:27.466 --> 09:28.831
Anything at your end?

09:29.735 --> 09:31.669
Same gray Mustang
that was at the crime scene

09:31.837 --> 09:35.238
was found this morning
outside of Deeks' apartment.

09:36.442 --> 09:37.807
Then it wasn't just a robbery.

09:37.977 --> 09:40.969
No, Deeks was targeted.

09:41.180 --> 09:44.638
Visitation hours are over.
You're on protection detail now.

09:44.817 --> 09:46.182
Sam and I are headed your way.

09:46.385 --> 09:47.716
Okay.

09:47.886 --> 09:51.014
Uh, Callen,
who is Deeks' next of kin?

09:51.657 --> 09:53.648
That's a good question.

10:00.466 --> 10:03.833
Eric's using Kaleidoscope
to look for that Mustang.

10:04.003 --> 10:05.493
If we're lucky, we'll get a hit.

10:05.671 --> 10:09.129
He's out of surgery.
He's gonna be okay.

10:09.808 --> 10:12.834
One never gets used to the idea
of losing an agent,

10:13.012 --> 10:14.741
on duty or off.

10:14.913 --> 10:16.676
Go make him safe.

10:18.517 --> 10:20.485
Oh, Hetty,
the hospital wanted to know

10:20.652 --> 10:22.847
who to put down
as Deeks' next of kin.

10:24.356 --> 10:25.983
Good question.

10:42.808 --> 10:44.332
Am I dead?

10:44.543 --> 10:46.534
Because I feel like I should be dead.

10:46.712 --> 10:49.681
Hey there.
You're not getting rid of me that easily.

10:51.683 --> 10:53.344
Do I know you?

10:53.519 --> 10:54.850
Deeks...

10:55.754 --> 10:58.689
- Not my nurse?
- I'm serious, Deeks.

10:59.725 --> 11:02.023
My name is Deeks?

11:02.194 --> 11:03.889
Really?

11:06.198 --> 11:09.099
I'm just kidding.
I remember you, Fern.

11:09.334 --> 11:12.269
Yeah? You're a funny guy? I'm gonna
punch you in your bullet hole.

11:12.438 --> 11:15.407
That sounds vaguely dirty.
I think I'm gonna have to tell Hetty. Ah.

11:15.574 --> 11:16.734
- Hi.
- Uh, I'm sorry.

11:16.909 --> 11:19.400
- Security. Can I see your ID, please?
- Oh.

11:23.282 --> 11:26.080
- You're awake.
- Yeah.

11:27.152 --> 11:30.883
- How do you feel?
- Oh, better and better.

11:31.056 --> 11:34.355
Pain-relief button, call button.
Okay, Mr. Deeks?

11:34.560 --> 11:35.788
You can call me Marty.

11:36.295 --> 11:38.763
If you need anything,
I'm right outside.

11:38.964 --> 11:40.295
Thank you, Nurse, uh...

11:41.667 --> 11:42.725
Debbie.

11:44.503 --> 11:46.494
Nurse Debbie.

11:48.674 --> 11:50.335
What?

11:50.509 --> 11:52.340
- What?
- What?

11:52.511 --> 11:54.445
What is it with guys and nurses?

11:54.613 --> 11:58.344
What are you talking about?
They're helpful and they're caring.

11:58.517 --> 12:00.144
You know,
they do the sponge-bath thing.

12:00.385 --> 12:02.683
Oh, come...
I should shoot you myself.

12:02.921 --> 12:05.412
Well, get in line.

12:07.793 --> 12:09.385
You guys catch my shooter yet?

12:09.595 --> 12:10.892
Working on it.

12:12.498 --> 12:14.295
And?

12:14.466 --> 12:16.127
What makes you think
there's an "and"?

12:16.335 --> 12:18.303
You heightened security,
you're checking badges.

12:18.470 --> 12:20.961
You're obviously expecting
unwanted visitors.

12:26.678 --> 12:31.138
The guys who shot you this morning,
ahem, did you recognize them?

12:31.316 --> 12:33.978
Well, it's hard to remember.

12:37.189 --> 12:40.420
I didn't walk in on a robbery.
Is that what you're telling me?

12:41.660 --> 12:43.287
- You were targeted.
- Ugh.

12:43.462 --> 12:44.520
There's footage of the car

12:44.696 --> 12:47.995
- on your block this morning.
- Why would somebody target me?

12:48.200 --> 12:50.327
Hey, I'm sure we all have
a very long list.

12:50.502 --> 12:52.197
Yeah.

12:53.705 --> 12:56.071
Is there anyone
you want me to contact?

12:56.241 --> 12:58.505
Friends, family?

12:59.144 --> 13:01.078
Girlfriend?

13:02.481 --> 13:03.948
Not dying, am I?

13:04.950 --> 13:07.714
- Not yet.
- Okay.

13:09.188 --> 13:10.314
Next of kin?

13:13.158 --> 13:15.183
Good question.

13:17.996 --> 13:20.396
He's lucky he's not dead,
because I'm gonna kill him.

13:20.566 --> 13:22.693
Oh, cut him some slack.

13:22.868 --> 13:23.994
What was he thinking?

13:24.169 --> 13:26.569
Leaving at the same time every day,
running the same route.

13:26.738 --> 13:29.332
Buying coffee from
the same store every day.

13:29.508 --> 13:31.669
Deeks is a cop.
He wasn't trained as an agent.

13:31.843 --> 13:34.209
It's easy to fall into a routine.

13:34.413 --> 13:37.382
It's bad tradecraft. As soon as he
recovers, he's gonna hear about it.

13:38.250 --> 13:41.742
It's his neighborhood, he felt safe.

13:41.920 --> 13:45.515
Look where that got him,
two shots to the chest.

13:46.258 --> 13:49.352
The last thing we need
is another Dom situation.

13:52.764 --> 13:57.030
When I run, I switch up the times.
I vary distance and directions.

13:57.202 --> 13:59.102
I belong to multiple gyms
under multiple names.

13:59.271 --> 14:01.899
It's complicated, but necessary.

14:02.808 --> 14:05.242
- Is that a humble brag?
- What?

14:05.744 --> 14:08.212
Well, you kind of went on there
about how much you work out.

14:08.380 --> 14:10.109
I was proving a point.

14:11.049 --> 14:14.780
I don't know.
Sounded like a humble brag to me.

14:15.220 --> 14:16.710
Whatever, man.

14:25.897 --> 14:28.491
Remember,
Deeks has been traumatized.

14:28.667 --> 14:30.430
- You go easy on him.
- Okay.

14:30.602 --> 14:32.433
After I give him a crash course
in tradecraft

14:32.604 --> 14:34.231
and before I rip him a new one.

14:34.406 --> 14:35.896
You're starting to sound like Hetty.

14:37.309 --> 14:39.004
- Eric.
- Kaleidoscope got a hit

14:39.177 --> 14:40.508
- on our Mustang.
- Where?

14:40.679 --> 14:43.910
Just outside Pacific Beach Medical.

14:44.116 --> 14:45.811
Callen, he's right there.

14:45.984 --> 14:49.317
Sam, gray Mustang, two suspects.

14:49.488 --> 14:50.819
They're coming to finish the job.

14:56.094 --> 14:58.062
Federal agents!

15:48.478 --> 15:50.912
A 24-hour security detail
has been assigned.

15:51.081 --> 15:52.844
Who would target Deeks?

15:53.016 --> 15:54.142
Must've been some mission

15:54.318 --> 15:56.115
for them to come back
in broad daylight.

15:56.286 --> 15:58.311
You think it's L.A.P.D. Related?

15:58.855 --> 15:59.913
Us or you guys.

16:00.090 --> 16:03.491
I mean, a guy like Deeks,
it could be anybody.

16:03.727 --> 16:06.457
I'm sure he's made plenty of friends
on both sides.

16:06.997 --> 16:09.693
Think you can put together a list
of possible suspects?

16:09.866 --> 16:11.094
Consider it done.

16:12.469 --> 16:14.664
- What do you got, Eric?
- Positive ID on the driver.

16:14.838 --> 16:16.965
Carlos Guzman,
he's a South L.A. Gang member

16:17.140 --> 16:19.267
who's been linked
to three non-gang-related murders.

16:19.443 --> 16:21.809
He usually works with a buddy
by the name of Santo Perez.

16:21.979 --> 16:23.469
I sent the file to your smartphone.

16:27.217 --> 16:29.811
It's our passenger from the Mustang.

16:31.321 --> 16:33.619
- Guns for hire?
- Sounds like it.

16:33.790 --> 16:35.280
Question is, who hired them?

16:36.860 --> 16:39.328
You know, Versey sure handed
this case over pretty easily.

16:41.198 --> 16:43.530
He's not exactly shaken up.

16:44.334 --> 16:47.770
Didn't even put a protective detail
on one of his own.

16:51.341 --> 16:52.706
- Yeah?
- Eric.

16:52.909 --> 16:55.070
Run Detective Jeff Versey
through our system.

16:55.278 --> 16:57.041
Got it.

16:58.382 --> 17:01.647
I get shot again,
you guys better be in tears.

17:01.818 --> 17:03.752
We weren't the last time.

17:03.920 --> 17:05.478
You weren't?

17:05.655 --> 17:08.317
I mean,
Eric may have teared up a little.

17:08.825 --> 17:10.554
Where is the love?

17:18.201 --> 17:19.862
It won't happen again.

17:20.037 --> 17:21.299
And you're gonna need this.

17:23.607 --> 17:26.166
They're moving you to a room
with a view.

17:26.675 --> 17:28.233
Thank you.

17:31.181 --> 17:33.376
You recognize either of these guys?

17:33.583 --> 17:35.210
Gang members.

17:35.385 --> 17:37.114
This one's deceased.

17:37.721 --> 17:40.588
Other than the one that used me
for target practice, no.

17:40.757 --> 17:42.622
Any idea who would want you dead?

17:43.427 --> 17:46.590
We're not doing our job if a few people
don't want us dead, right?

17:46.830 --> 17:48.798
Ha. Pfft. Humble brag.

17:48.965 --> 17:51.195
- We'll let him slide.
- Considering he's been shot.

17:51.401 --> 17:53.767
Humble what?

17:53.970 --> 17:55.335
One of Kensi's bad habits.

17:56.606 --> 18:00.042
You mean like when she complains
about something really positive?

18:00.243 --> 18:01.437
Exactly.

18:01.878 --> 18:05.109
Like when she says her size-two jeans
are too baggy on her?

18:05.982 --> 18:07.973
- That's not what I meant. That's...
- Ha, ha.

18:08.218 --> 18:11.244
Okay, did you see the shooter
or not?

18:11.655 --> 18:14.453
A small guy, small gun.

18:14.624 --> 18:17.889
About 5'7", wiry, pretty fast.

18:18.595 --> 18:20.085
Fits Santo's description.

18:21.364 --> 18:24.265
You know, for gang members,
that's not a lot of firepower.

18:24.434 --> 18:26.766
It looked like a.22.

18:26.937 --> 18:29.098
That's gonna get you laughed at
in the streets, right?

18:29.306 --> 18:30.739
That driver must have gunned up.

18:31.775 --> 18:34.471
Found a.45 caliber
with Rhinos on the driver.

18:35.312 --> 18:37.280
Somebody
really doesn't like you, Deeks.

18:37.447 --> 18:40.143
Yeah, why didn't he get it right
the first time?

18:41.284 --> 18:43.980
This place is crawling
with L.A.P.D. You should be safe.

18:44.187 --> 18:45.916
Yeah, who's gonna protect me
from her?

18:46.089 --> 18:47.954
Ha. Oh, I think he's feeling better.

18:48.125 --> 18:50.650
After you recover,
you and I are gonna talk.

18:54.698 --> 18:57.166
Hey, if you see Nurse Debbie
out there, will you, uh...?

18:58.135 --> 18:59.932
Will you ask her
when I get my sponge bath?

19:00.604 --> 19:01.969
Definitely feeling better.

19:03.507 --> 19:04.599
Yeah.

19:09.146 --> 19:11.444
Miss Jones?

19:11.615 --> 19:13.480
A moment.

19:18.021 --> 19:19.181
For me?

19:21.024 --> 19:24.983
Uh, release papers
for inmate Gordon John Brandel

19:25.162 --> 19:27.323
from Folsom State Prison?

19:27.497 --> 19:29.522
Parole contacts and addresses.

19:29.699 --> 19:31.462
I need you to track him down.

19:32.936 --> 19:34.699
Will do.

19:35.572 --> 19:37.733
Oh, Miss Jones?

19:40.143 --> 19:41.701
Discreetly.

19:48.552 --> 19:51.385
- Yes.
- Oh, what's all the hubbub?

19:51.555 --> 19:55.252
I tracked down our driver's partner
in crime, pun intended, Santo Perez.

19:55.458 --> 19:57.153
- That was fast.
- One way of putting it.

19:57.327 --> 19:59.158
Another way would be
"expedient," "swift,"

19:59.329 --> 20:02.025
or my personal favorite,
"greased lightning."

20:03.400 --> 20:05.493
- Too much?
- Tad bit.

20:05.669 --> 20:06.727
So how did you find him?

20:07.270 --> 20:10.068
I plugged Santo's mug shot
into the facial-rec database

20:10.240 --> 20:14.176
and cross-referenced it with all the
major social media networking sites.

20:14.344 --> 20:18.041
Now, the majority of smartphones
and digital cameras nowadays

20:18.215 --> 20:20.706
use some version
of instant upload software.

20:20.917 --> 20:25.616
So if he pops up on a Buddybook
page or a Twitpic, we'll know.

20:25.789 --> 20:27.586
- Case in point.
- Hmm.

20:27.791 --> 20:30.055
Midtown Lanes bowling alley.

20:30.227 --> 20:33.560
Friends of birthday girl
Katrina Hobbs.

20:34.731 --> 20:37.222
Girls just wanna have fun, okay.

20:37.434 --> 20:39.368
Wait for it.

20:40.103 --> 20:41.798
Santo.

20:42.772 --> 20:45.605
I accessed
their surveillance system.

20:45.775 --> 20:46.867
He's still there.

20:48.211 --> 20:50.076
And I know where he's going next.

20:50.280 --> 20:51.474
The boatshed.

20:51.648 --> 20:53.309
Calling the guys.

20:56.253 --> 20:59.245
Assault and battery, armed robbery,
attempted murder.

20:59.422 --> 21:00.889
That's quite a résumé, Santo.

21:01.958 --> 21:04.586
What can I say?
I'm an overachiever.

21:05.128 --> 21:08.461
Who hired you and your buddy
to shoot the guy in the store?

21:08.632 --> 21:10.497
I don't know
what you're talking about.

21:10.667 --> 21:14.068
Third strike, Santo.
The guy you shot was a cop.

21:15.272 --> 21:17.900
Oh. The guy who hired you
didn't tell you that, huh?

21:20.744 --> 21:23.611
Give me his name.
I may be able to help you.

21:23.813 --> 21:26.407
Maybe reduce your sentence.

21:31.488 --> 21:34.423
You think you know what's going
down, but you don't know nothing.

21:35.625 --> 21:37.422
Enjoy your vacation in Chino.

21:39.663 --> 21:42.496
- We're missing something.
- And he knows it.

21:42.666 --> 21:45.965
- No, he's taunting us.
- More like he's scared of something.

21:46.136 --> 21:47.865
You can be a little intimidating.

21:48.505 --> 21:49.699
Someone bigger than me.

21:51.675 --> 21:53.199
This is what I'm thinking.

21:53.376 --> 21:57.312
This phone is registered to Santo.
This one is burned.

21:57.514 --> 21:58.640
Check the call log.

21:58.848 --> 22:00.975
I already did,
nothing older than a week.

22:01.151 --> 22:02.516
So it was just activated.

22:02.686 --> 22:06.520
No calls going out, 13 calls coming in,
all from blocked numbers.

22:06.723 --> 22:08.156
Or maybe from one number.

22:08.358 --> 22:10.826
Exactly, if you wanna talk to the guy
doing your dirty work,

22:10.994 --> 22:12.359
you give him a clean phone.

22:12.529 --> 22:13.723
Let's call Eric.

22:13.897 --> 22:15.091
Hey, guys.

22:15.732 --> 22:19.862
Okay, either you've got impeccable
timing or you're developing ESP.

22:20.103 --> 22:21.161
I found something.

22:21.338 --> 22:22.805
Internal Affairs investigated

22:22.972 --> 22:25.907
an L.A.P.D. Officer for corruption
three years ago.

22:26.609 --> 22:28.008
How is this connected to Deeks?

22:28.178 --> 22:31.614
Deeks was the informant.
He initiated the investigation.

22:31.815 --> 22:33.112
Who were they investigating?

22:34.718 --> 22:36.913
Detective Jeff Versey.

22:52.367 --> 22:54.358
"Versey was eventually cleared
by Internal Affairs

22:54.536 --> 22:57.994
but has been passed up
for promotion three times."

22:58.173 --> 23:00.539
Looks like Versey picked a fistfight
with Deeks.

23:00.742 --> 23:03.210
Blamed him for ruining his career.

23:03.378 --> 23:06.438
Looks like Versey forgot
a few minor details.

23:17.158 --> 23:18.955
I was just on my way
to see you guys.

23:19.160 --> 23:21.958
Well, it seems you left out
a few details at our last meeting.

23:22.130 --> 23:24.394
You forgot to mention
you had a history with Deeks.

23:25.700 --> 23:28.191
Because that's exactly
what it is, history.

23:30.805 --> 23:31.897
What happened?

23:32.073 --> 23:34.200
You blame Deeks
for your career stalling out?

23:34.409 --> 23:35.967
Decided to get a little revenge?

23:36.778 --> 23:40.839
Look, Deeks' accusation
was a wake-up call.

23:41.016 --> 23:42.847
Made me take the steps
to get sober.

23:43.051 --> 23:44.780
So yeah, I may not get promoted,

23:45.420 --> 23:47.650
but I also know
that I'm lucky to still have a job.

23:50.291 --> 23:54.057
Last year, Deeks comes by,
banging on my door at 3 a.m.

23:54.229 --> 23:56.595
I'm on vacation.

23:56.798 --> 23:58.732
I almost ripped his head off
when I saw him.

23:58.933 --> 24:01.333
You're not exactly helping
your case here.

24:01.536 --> 24:05.302
When I calmed down,
I realized what he was doing.

24:07.409 --> 24:09.206
He was checking in on my sobriety.

24:10.612 --> 24:13.103
Deeks is the closest thing I have
to a sponsor.

24:15.517 --> 24:17.917
I hate to admit it, but I need him.

24:21.756 --> 24:24.623
Doesn't mean I like him,
but he's a good cop.

24:25.960 --> 24:29.088
Better off looking at those guys
before you look at me.

24:30.598 --> 24:34.591
- Lot of names.
- Like I said, good cop.

24:53.221 --> 24:54.654
I was gonna eat that.

24:57.358 --> 24:59.417
It's been sitting there for hours.

24:59.594 --> 25:01.118
I like to let my Jell-O breathe.

25:05.233 --> 25:07.667
Mm. Big baby.

25:08.636 --> 25:10.627
I got shot, all right?

25:10.805 --> 25:12.397
It's not like it is in the movies.

25:12.574 --> 25:14.974
There's no slow motion. Ouch.

25:15.143 --> 25:16.838
There's no awesome music
being played.

25:17.011 --> 25:19.070
It's just pain.

25:20.915 --> 25:22.109
Have you ever been shot?

25:23.785 --> 25:26.015
You have been shot. Where?

25:26.654 --> 25:27.882
I've never been shot.

25:28.490 --> 25:30.253
I don't believe you.

25:31.159 --> 25:32.490
Was it an embarrassing body part?

25:34.596 --> 25:35.620
It was, wasn't it?

25:35.797 --> 25:38.129
There's a lot about ourselves
we haven't told each other.

25:38.299 --> 25:40.927
So let's just respect the pace, okay?

25:41.636 --> 25:43.297
Okay.

25:44.005 --> 25:46.940
Can you give me a hint?
Was it above or below the waist?

25:47.142 --> 25:51.442
Sam faxed over a list of suspects,
and there's a lot of names here.

25:51.613 --> 25:53.604
There's gotta be about a hundred,
so let's just...

25:54.516 --> 25:56.006
I really pissed off that many people?

25:56.184 --> 25:57.845
I was thinking the list
was pretty short.

25:58.052 --> 25:59.815
Well, maybe you should add
your name to it.

25:59.988 --> 26:01.649
- Yeah, you have a pencil?
- The butt.

26:02.557 --> 26:04.320
I bet you were shot in the butt.

26:06.027 --> 26:07.654
How about we start
at the beginning?

26:07.829 --> 26:10.354
Seems like as good a place as any.

26:10.532 --> 26:11.965
"Victor Rush."

26:12.167 --> 26:13.498
Victor Rush? Victor Rush?

26:13.668 --> 26:15.499
Petty theft. Repeat offender.

26:15.670 --> 26:17.228
"Ronald Greene."

26:19.174 --> 26:23.167
Second-degree murder,
um, surrendered.

26:23.378 --> 26:24.470
"Sylvia Gray."

26:25.847 --> 26:27.314
Restraining order.

26:27.849 --> 26:30.477
Me against her because it was a...

26:30.985 --> 26:32.816
It was a bad breakup.

26:34.155 --> 26:35.986
We're gonna need more Jell-O.

26:36.191 --> 26:38.056
Uh, you wanted to see me?

26:38.226 --> 26:40.524
Any progress, Miss Jones?

26:40.728 --> 26:43.720
Well, I checked the DMV, IRS
and Social Security.

26:43.898 --> 26:48.028
And checking in with the state police
as we speak.

26:48.236 --> 26:50.067
I take that as a no.

26:51.072 --> 26:53.233
Yes, that's a no.

26:54.909 --> 26:57.173
Something I can do for you,
Mr. Callen?

26:58.713 --> 27:00.203
Is there something
you wanna tell me?

27:01.549 --> 27:03.380
No.

27:04.886 --> 27:06.410
We're on the same page here, right?

27:06.621 --> 27:08.919
Well, what would make you
think otherwise?

27:09.724 --> 27:11.555
Just seems like
you're a few pages ahead.

27:11.759 --> 27:14.387
I'm a fast reader.

27:15.797 --> 27:17.958
You will tell me
if something comes up, right?

27:18.132 --> 27:20.100
Of course, Mr. Callen.

27:24.806 --> 27:26.535
Keep looking, Miss Jones.

27:29.410 --> 27:30.638
We got something.

27:30.812 --> 27:34.077
I used the burn phone's serial number
to track down its supplier.

27:34.249 --> 27:36.649
It's a retailer in North Hollywood
to be exact.

27:36.818 --> 27:39.048
- Cash payment.
- There's no surprise there.

27:39.220 --> 27:40.380
Now, if you wanna be safe,

27:40.555 --> 27:42.455
you wouldn't use your own phone
to place calls.

27:42.624 --> 27:45.821
- You'd buy two burn phones.
- One for him, one for Santo.

27:46.060 --> 27:48.051
Which is precisely what he did.

27:48.229 --> 27:50.288
The retailer sold two burn phones

27:50.465 --> 27:53.491
and kept a record of the allocated
SIM cards for both of them.

27:53.668 --> 27:55.829
We've got the number
of the second burn phone.

27:56.404 --> 27:58.269
It's still active.

27:58.439 --> 28:00.999
We can call him, set up a meet.

28:01.175 --> 28:04.474
It's gotta be somebody
he can't ignore.

28:04.679 --> 28:07.079
With something he really needs.

28:07.915 --> 28:10.145
All right, Eric,
I need some backstopping.

28:10.318 --> 28:13.048
- Name, phone number, address.
- Occupation?

28:13.921 --> 28:15.149
Attorney.

28:15.623 --> 28:17.853
Uh, sixty more to go.

28:18.059 --> 28:21.051
I would say that's progress
in a Bizarro type of way.

28:22.764 --> 28:24.322
Bizarro?

28:24.499 --> 28:26.763
It's Superman's evil opposite.
It's nothing.

28:26.968 --> 28:28.993
I know who he is.
How do you know who he is?

28:29.570 --> 28:31.333
My dad's comic-book collection.

28:31.873 --> 28:34.842
I got my own, DC and Marvel.

28:35.376 --> 28:37.310
- You still got yours?
- Of course.

28:37.979 --> 28:39.708
Me too.

28:45.386 --> 28:46.444
All right.

28:48.956 --> 28:50.617
"Eduardo Cruz"?

28:56.531 --> 28:59.091
Yo, what's up?

29:00.001 --> 29:02.231
Nothing, I just got lazy.

29:02.737 --> 29:06.002
I didn't change my routine,
made myself an easy target.

29:09.210 --> 29:12.509
I change my routine
every single day.

29:12.680 --> 29:15.205
Never drive the same way to work.
Always security-conscious.

29:15.416 --> 29:17.179
Impossible target, I get it.

29:17.385 --> 29:20.377
No, Deeks, what I'm saying is
that it's hard.

29:20.555 --> 29:22.182
You shouldn't beat yourself up.

29:22.390 --> 29:26.121
Can't help it.
It's one of the things I'm good at.

29:36.771 --> 29:38.329
Some cop, huh?

29:41.042 --> 29:42.907
Your name is Kurt Donnerson,

29:43.077 --> 29:45.602
small-time attorney
with a questionable background.

29:45.780 --> 29:47.748
Kurt Donnerson.

29:47.915 --> 29:49.246
What if he doesn't take the bait?

29:49.450 --> 29:52.146
He'll take the bait
as long as he answers his phone.

29:53.755 --> 29:55.450
Trace is set to activate.

30:10.037 --> 30:11.527
Again.

30:16.277 --> 30:17.301
Yes?

30:17.478 --> 30:20.038
This is Kurt Donnerson,
I've got something you'll want.

30:20.214 --> 30:21.545
How did you get this number?

30:21.716 --> 30:23.911
Friendly cop.

30:24.085 --> 30:26.280
What do you want?

30:26.454 --> 30:28.922
Marty Deeks died 30 minutes ago.

30:29.090 --> 30:30.250
And how do you know this?

30:30.458 --> 30:33.791
I'm his attorney.
Well, I was his attorney.

30:33.961 --> 30:35.451
You don't have anything I need.

30:35.630 --> 30:37.564
Well, I have a lot of details.

30:38.199 --> 30:40.497
I'm sure you know
Marty liked to talk.

30:41.335 --> 30:43.530
I think maybe you and I
ought to meet, uh,

30:43.704 --> 30:45.797
come up with
a mutually beneficial deal

30:45.973 --> 30:48.601
so that Marty takes his secrets
to the grave.

30:49.744 --> 30:52.611
Or I could call my friend
at the L.A.P.D.

30:52.780 --> 30:56.272
Downtown, 4th and Anderson,
warehouse, 3:00.

30:56.451 --> 30:57.713
Yeah, I don't think so.

30:58.419 --> 31:00.614
How about the food court
at Santa Monica Place?

31:00.788 --> 31:02.415
Got a variety of dining options,

31:02.590 --> 31:06.082
plenty of shopping
and lots of people around.

31:06.260 --> 31:08.785
Warehouse, take it or leave it.

31:08.963 --> 31:10.726
I'll be there.

31:11.299 --> 31:13.096
You might wanna ditch
your burn phone.

31:13.267 --> 31:15.201
Next call is likely gonna be
from the L.A.P.D.

31:17.772 --> 31:20.002
I'll narrow the location to downtown.

31:20.174 --> 31:21.505
Close, but no prize.

31:22.977 --> 31:24.001
Play it back.

31:26.581 --> 31:29.049
- Yes?
- This is Kurt Donnerson.

31:29.250 --> 31:31.844
- I've got something you'll want.
- Eastern European, maybe.

31:32.019 --> 31:34.214
Friendly cop.

31:34.388 --> 31:36.379
What do you want?

31:36.557 --> 31:38.787
Marty Deeks died 30 minutes ago.

31:38.960 --> 31:41.292
- And how do you know this?
- I'm his attorney.

31:41.462 --> 31:44.556
Meet's in two hours.
He'll bring friends.

31:45.333 --> 31:48.302
But he's gonna wanna know what
Donnerson knows before he kills him.

31:48.503 --> 31:50.334
I'm sure you know
Marty liked to talk.

32:04.417 --> 32:06.282
How did you get this number?

32:06.452 --> 32:08.215
Friendly cop.

32:08.388 --> 32:09.946
It doesn't sound familiar.

32:11.324 --> 32:12.484
And how do you know this?

32:12.692 --> 32:15.593
- You got something?
- Ugh. I can't put my finger on it.

32:15.762 --> 32:18.560
- You recognize the voice?
- Not the voice, the accent.

32:18.731 --> 32:21.598
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
it's Eastern European, maybe Russian.

32:22.335 --> 32:24.769
That's awesome, because
I've narrowed it down to three,

32:24.938 --> 32:27.133
none of which
are Eastern European.

32:27.307 --> 32:30.299
Well, we'll know soon enough.
Callen's on his way to meet this guy.

32:30.510 --> 32:35.971
Okay, Ivan Lee
and Michael Thompson.

32:36.215 --> 32:38.683
My personal testimony
put them both away.

32:38.851 --> 32:40.443
Life sentences, non-related cases

32:40.620 --> 32:43.111
and they're both gonna hate me
until the day that I die.

32:43.323 --> 32:45.291
Possible they could have
hired someone.

32:46.592 --> 32:48.526
- Possible.
- But you highly doubt it.

32:48.728 --> 32:49.922
Yeah.

32:51.864 --> 32:54.128
There's only two names here.
You said there were three.

32:54.634 --> 32:56.864
Third guy I shot
when I was 11 years old.

33:00.974 --> 33:02.464
His name?

33:03.776 --> 33:06.142
Gordon John Brandel.

33:22.996 --> 33:24.293
Callen, do you read?

33:25.832 --> 33:28.266
Loud and clear.

33:30.269 --> 33:32.499
- Sam?
- I copy.

33:35.141 --> 33:39.475
Deeks gave me the names of three
people who may have targeted him.

33:42.515 --> 33:44.506
What did he say about Brandel?

33:44.717 --> 33:48.483
That he shot him when he was 11.

33:49.322 --> 33:52.553
- Anything else?
- That's it.

33:53.092 --> 33:56.118
- Keep looking for him, Nell.
- Mm-hm.

34:12.411 --> 34:14.039
Well, maybe after this, Sam,

34:14.679 --> 34:17.672
we can get Hetty to put us
on the next space shuttle launch.

34:17.850 --> 34:20.045
Knock it off your Bond list.

34:20.253 --> 34:23.313
Keep talking to me and the tac team
will be a little slow in saving you.

34:23.523 --> 34:25.855
Mm-hm. That's assuming
that I would need to be saved.

34:26.059 --> 34:27.321
You always need saving.

34:27.527 --> 34:28.755
That's really not true.

34:28.928 --> 34:32.694
Although, Hetty tells me I do need
to learn to include others.

34:48.214 --> 34:50.079
Why didn't he finish me off?

34:50.248 --> 34:52.717
Panic? Fired wildly?

34:52.885 --> 34:54.978
- No, he aimed.
- And missed.

34:55.154 --> 34:58.419
Okay, so why is he carrying a.22?
It's a girl's gun.

34:58.624 --> 35:01.889
- I'm a girl.
- Well, you're not a real girl.

35:02.061 --> 35:03.153
You're like...

35:03.362 --> 35:04.556
You're like Wonder Woman,

35:04.730 --> 35:07.290
and you know Wonder Woman
wouldn't carry a.22.

35:07.800 --> 35:09.859
Compliment accepted.

35:10.069 --> 35:11.593
Yeah.

35:11.771 --> 35:14.968
Also, if you're gonna kill with a.22,
you gotta shoot directly in the head.

35:15.174 --> 35:16.766
Otherwise,
it's only gonna wound you.

35:18.611 --> 35:21.011
Unless that's what they wanted.

35:23.182 --> 35:26.151
It's after 3. Where is he?

36:01.654 --> 36:03.952
Wait a minute.

36:04.123 --> 36:07.354
If I'm an easy target, that makes
you guys impossible targets, right?

36:08.728 --> 36:10.821
I mean, I'm new to this,
but you guys...

36:10.997 --> 36:14.125
You guys live your life with a regimen
that includes awareness at all times.

36:14.300 --> 36:16.029
- You said so yourself.
- I'm not...

36:16.202 --> 36:17.464
I'm sorry, I'm not following.

36:17.670 --> 36:18.694
I'm a cop, right?

36:18.871 --> 36:22.534
And like it or not, I'm the weakest link.
So, what if I'm not the target?

36:23.342 --> 36:27.039
- What if I'm the bait?
- To lure the rest of us out.

36:29.715 --> 36:32.684
- Go, Kensi.
- Eric, Callen is walking into a trap.

36:32.852 --> 36:35.844
Deeks was not the target. This was
a setup to hit the rest of the team.

36:36.022 --> 36:38.388
Callen, Sam,
Kensi says abort mission.

36:38.558 --> 36:39.752
It's a trap.

36:41.027 --> 36:44.758
- You are safe, they are not.
- Wait a minute, I'm still thinking here.

36:46.332 --> 36:48.698
Doesn't add up.

36:48.868 --> 36:53.032
If we're the targets, this is
the perfect place for an ambush.

36:53.239 --> 36:55.332
Unless we're not the target.

36:55.541 --> 36:56.565
If I'm not the target,

36:56.742 --> 37:00.508
why did Santo and his buddy
come back to the hospital?

37:00.680 --> 37:02.011
Kensi!

37:02.215 --> 37:04.183
Kensi.

37:24.103 --> 37:25.127
Sorry.

37:26.505 --> 37:27.631
- Sam?
- Kensi.

37:27.807 --> 37:29.399
- Sam?
- Kensi.

37:29.609 --> 37:30.633
Hello?

37:32.044 --> 37:33.739
Ugh, great.

37:33.913 --> 37:34.971
Lost her.

37:36.349 --> 37:39.614
Eric, call L.A.P.D. Security
and let them know what's going on.

37:39.785 --> 37:42.219
And keep trying Kensi.
Do not let her leave the hospital.

37:42.421 --> 37:44.548
She's the target.

37:47.293 --> 37:49.523
Come on, come on, come on.

37:51.631 --> 37:53.929
Oh, finally.
Sam, I'm coming to you guys.

37:54.133 --> 37:56.624
Do not leave the hospital.
We're on our way to you.

37:56.836 --> 37:59.430
Kensi, you're the target.

38:18.991 --> 38:22.256
- Okay.
- Get your hands up in the air!

38:22.461 --> 38:24.588
I need everybody back!

38:26.265 --> 38:27.755
Joshua.

38:29.435 --> 38:30.663
Joshua.

38:38.477 --> 38:39.501
Deeks.

38:39.679 --> 38:40.941
- I got him.
- Oh, God.

38:41.113 --> 38:43.343
- Get a gurney!
- Give me the weapon.

38:55.661 --> 38:56.958
All right.

38:57.129 --> 38:58.323
Okay.

39:01.200 --> 39:05.159
Our Chechen terrorist
known only as Vakar.

39:05.371 --> 39:07.703
Must have thought you could
lead him to his wife and son.

39:07.907 --> 39:11.001
Joshua Mastin
and his mother, Emma.

39:11.210 --> 39:15.738
Former Chechen Shahidka,
or in English, Black Widow.

39:15.981 --> 39:19.075
When I was relocating them
after the first attempt to kill her,

39:19.251 --> 39:20.843
she told me he'd try again.

39:21.020 --> 39:22.487
She was right.

39:22.688 --> 39:24.553
But he had to find you first.

39:27.827 --> 39:29.192
Deeks.

39:29.395 --> 39:33.354
Mr. Deeks needs to brush up
his security protocol.

39:33.532 --> 39:34.556
Mr. Hanna?

39:36.235 --> 39:38.396
With pleasure.

39:40.206 --> 39:42.674
Should be worth watching.

39:55.187 --> 39:58.281
So will you tell them?

39:59.792 --> 40:01.783
I wish I could.

40:01.961 --> 40:06.364
Three days after I relocated them
with new identities, they vanished.

40:24.750 --> 40:27.719
I've finished the research
on Gordon John Brandel.

40:28.888 --> 40:31.550
- Thank you, Miss Jones.
- Mm-hm.

40:45.104 --> 40:47.265
Thank you, Miss Jones.

41:08.727 --> 41:10.285
Hey.

41:11.664 --> 41:14.724
How long have you been there?

41:16.469 --> 41:17.766
Long enough.

41:17.970 --> 41:19.995
You should have woke me up.

41:20.239 --> 41:22.036
You need your rest.

41:30.649 --> 41:32.981
You ate my Jell-O.

41:42.194 --> 41:44.059
What can I do for you?

41:45.965 --> 41:49.332
Well, given the circumstances,

41:49.502 --> 41:55.463
I thought it would be appropriate
to update my files on your next of kin.

41:55.641 --> 41:58.337
Gordon John Brandel.

42:00.846 --> 42:02.711
Your father.

42:05.518 --> 42:08.078
I figured you always knew.

42:08.320 --> 42:10.720
You figured correctly.

42:14.193 --> 42:16.821
I was 11 when I shot him.

42:17.363 --> 42:20.696
- He was wielding a shotgun.
- Yeah.

42:20.866 --> 42:23.596
It was self-defense.

42:27.072 --> 42:31.372
He was incarcerated
in, um, Folsom State Prison.

42:31.544 --> 42:33.569
Paroled in 1996

42:34.313 --> 42:38.716
after serving five years
of a seven-year sentence.

42:42.354 --> 42:43.378
You found him?

42:44.857 --> 42:49.317
Yes, I found him.

42:57.369 --> 42:59.064
He died

42:59.238 --> 43:01.763
in 1998.

43:03.108 --> 43:05.542
Auto accident.

43:16.288 --> 43:18.085
Hospital admin asked me
for my next of kin.

43:18.257 --> 43:19.349
Who should I, uh?

43:21.594 --> 43:23.118
Who should I put down?

43:26.231 --> 43:30.167
"Lange, Henrietta."
