01:27.080 --> 01:28.308
As God is my witness...

01:28.520 --> 01:32.274
...I will never drive anyone in
this family anyplace ever again.

01:32.520 --> 01:34.192
All I get from you are complaints.

01:34.400 --> 01:37.870
I think you kids are nuts.
I didn't think it was scary.

01:49.320 --> 01:51.276
Get some glasses, Dad.

01:52.080 --> 01:55.356
For the thousandth time,
I do not need glasses.

01:55.560 --> 01:57.073
You're overreacting. Ask anyone.

01:57.720 --> 01:59.199
Fine. Buck?

02:07.360 --> 02:09.237
I'm telling you,
I do not need glasses.

02:09.440 --> 02:13.035
My vision was checked
in the fourth grade and it's perfect.

02:13.920 --> 02:15.638
Then how come you missed
that big sign?

02:15.880 --> 02:18.713
One sign. "Bridge and Zere Street."

02:18.920 --> 02:22.117
No, that was "bridge ends here," Dad.

02:23.960 --> 02:26.315
Daddy, I have never been
so scared in my life.

02:26.520 --> 02:27.748
I thought I was gonna die.

02:27.960 --> 02:30.554
Worse than that, I thought
I was gonna die with my family.

02:30.760 --> 02:32.591
How uncool is that?

02:32.840 --> 02:34.751
We didn't go all the way
into the river.

02:35.120 --> 02:37.793
Close enough to hear
the fish hacking.

02:38.280 --> 02:41.397
Come on, Daddy, why don't you just
break down and get some glasses.

02:41.640 --> 02:45.633
I mean, what are you afraid of? All it
says is that you're blind and old.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.199
Dad's not old.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.789
I mean, he can still do everything
he used to.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.274
See him sitting there?

02:52.480 --> 02:56.189
Just like when we were babies.
Way to go, Dad.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.158
And it never occurred
to anyone here...

02:58.360 --> 03:01.397
...that I read "bridge ends here"
just fine and floored it anyway?

03:01.600 --> 03:06.276
Now, I'm going to prove my prowess
by reading TV Guide.

03:12.640 --> 03:14.278
"TV Guide."

03:16.520 --> 03:19.114
There. Any more doubters?

03:19.320 --> 03:20.435
Who's on the cover?

03:25.840 --> 03:28.035
Raymond Burr.

03:28.920 --> 03:31.559
It's Delta Burke, Dad.

03:36.280 --> 03:37.508
Raymond Burr, Delta Burke.

03:37.720 --> 03:40.473
Tell me I'm the first one
to make that mistake.

03:41.120 --> 03:43.475
- Well...
- Yeah.

03:43.680 --> 03:47.593
Now, where's
my remote control?

03:54.040 --> 03:56.110
Glasses, eh?

03:59.640 --> 04:01.915
What the hell's wrong
with this thing now?

04:05.040 --> 04:08.828
You know, it doesn't seem right
making fun of Dad without Mom.

04:09.040 --> 04:12.828
Well, she was in a food coma when
we left, so she should be awake soon.

04:13.040 --> 04:15.508
I'm hungry.

04:15.960 --> 04:17.870
Yep, right on time.

04:18.079 --> 04:21.834
Well, I guess it's time
for a trip on down to Cake and Cow.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.072
Damn remote. Kids, get me
some batteries while you're out.

04:29.440 --> 04:31.749
Hey, is...

04:36.120 --> 04:38.475
Is...? Is Al busy?

04:39.000 --> 04:41.230
He's been spending a lot of time
thinking about...

04:41.440 --> 04:43.431
...man's ultimate place
in the universe.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.036
He must be on a break.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.556
Hi, Al. I'm sorry to bother you.

04:57.760 --> 05:00.115
I thought maybe we'd catch
a ball game or something.

05:00.320 --> 05:02.311
I'm not allowed to watch sports
at home.

05:02.520 --> 05:05.353
Marcie feels it's a bad influence
on the foetus.

05:05.560 --> 05:08.632
- What's she watching?
- Chippendales video.

05:12.480 --> 05:15.233
There we go, sports.
Good old American entertainment.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.431
The problem with women
is they'll watch anything.

05:17.640 --> 05:18.914
- Yeah.
- We're more selective.

05:19.120 --> 05:20.758
- Right. Who's playing?
- I don't know.

05:20.960 --> 05:22.678
All right.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.073
We'll be right back with our Cuban
Little League game of the week.

05:28.360 --> 05:29.554
This could be good.

05:29.760 --> 05:31.955
And don't forget to order
our sports bloopers...

05:32.160 --> 05:35.436
...that weren't funny enough to mak e
it on the 20 other tapes we sell.

05:35.640 --> 05:38.108
And now let's have our sports quiz
for the day.

05:38.320 --> 05:41.471
And the first caller with
the correct answer wins $100.

05:41.920 --> 05:44.593
A hundred bucks?
Hey, Al, you know a lot about sports.

05:44.800 --> 05:49.316
Maybe you could win the hundred
and buy yourself a newer Dodge.

05:51.320 --> 05:53.470
No chance.
These questions are so obscure...

05:53.680 --> 05:56.240
...you have to have no life
whatsoever to get the answer.

05:56.440 --> 05:59.034
Who played centre field
for the Chicago White Sox...

05:59.240 --> 06:00.639
...in the '59 World Series?

06:00.840 --> 06:02.717
Jim Landis. I know that.
That's Jim Landis.

06:02.920 --> 06:05.673
The number is on the bottom
of your screen.

06:07.760 --> 06:11.594
- "One-nine-oh-oh... Five-five..."
- What's the matter, Al?

06:11.800 --> 06:13.597
- Can't you see that?
- Yes, I can see it.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.916
There's too many
damn numbers there.

06:17.080 --> 06:18.957
Nine-five-five...

06:21.680 --> 06:24.035
Hello. Jim Landis.

06:24.240 --> 06:26.834
No, I'm not Jim Landis.
I'm answering the question.

06:27.040 --> 06:28.359
Jim Landis.

06:28.560 --> 06:31.472
What do you mean fish?
Fish didn't play centre field.

06:31.680 --> 06:34.148
Fish was a spin-off on Barney Miller.

06:35.640 --> 06:38.791
Oh, that's ridiculous.
Why would I call a fish store?

06:39.840 --> 06:42.070
- I think you got the wrong number.
- No, I didn't.

06:42.280 --> 06:45.795
I saw those numbers just as plain
as I see Bea Arthur's face on that TV.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.468
That's Fidel Castro.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.633
That's an honest mistake.

06:51.840 --> 06:54.673
Nobody's answered our question yet.
Someone should know this.

06:54.880 --> 06:57.838
We're gonna flash the number
one more time.

07:02.960 --> 07:04.313
- Got it.
- Jim Landis.

07:04.520 --> 07:07.637
Hold everything. We've got a winner.

07:08.120 --> 07:10.759
- My name? Jefferson D'Arcy.
- That's my money.

07:10.960 --> 07:14.748
I'm sorry, Al, you gotta be quicker.
It's a young man's world.

07:31.040 --> 07:32.758
Daddy, what happened to our door?

07:33.560 --> 07:36.074
A young man went through it.

07:41.720 --> 07:43.597
Daddy, what are you doing?

07:43.800 --> 07:46.633
What does it look like, honey?
I'm watching TV.

07:46.840 --> 07:48.876
Turn it off for a second.
I wanna talk to you.

07:49.080 --> 07:51.150
The sports question
is about to come on.

07:51.360 --> 07:53.430
This will only take a minute.

07:55.920 --> 07:58.070
Now, I wanna talk to you
about glasses.

07:58.320 --> 07:59.992
I don't need glasses.

08:00.360 --> 08:03.909
No, Daddy, you do not want glasses.
And I know why.

08:04.120 --> 08:06.350
You don't want glasses
because you're vain.

08:06.560 --> 08:09.677
Because you're feeling old and ugly.

08:11.080 --> 08:16.029
You don't want to be called
a four-eyes, a geek, an owl boy...

08:16.240 --> 08:20.631
...professor, dorko,
Poindexter, Magoo...

08:20.840 --> 08:23.673
- Let's see, what else?
- Goofus.

08:23.880 --> 08:26.713
No, that's more if your ears stick out.
You know...

08:27.720 --> 08:29.551
Go away.

08:31.520 --> 08:32.748
I'm not done yet, Dad.

08:33.240 --> 08:37.631
Now, let me tell you a little story about
a boy I used to date in the fourth grade.

08:37.840 --> 08:39.273
He was very handsome.

08:39.480 --> 08:42.392
A tight little butt,
big blue bedroom eyes.

08:42.640 --> 08:44.517
This was in the fourth grade?

08:45.080 --> 08:47.355
Well, he was left back a year.

08:48.640 --> 08:50.631
Hey, Dad, who played
for the Celtics...

08:50.840 --> 08:52.717
...called the best sixth man
in basketball?

08:52.920 --> 08:54.797
- Frank Ramsey.
- Thanks, Dad.

08:55.320 --> 08:57.390
Go ahead, pumpkin.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.071
Anyway, this guy was great.

09:00.280 --> 09:02.794
He was the most popular boy
in the school.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.072
- And then one day, he got glasses.
- And you liked him anyway.

09:06.680 --> 09:09.319
God, no, I dumped him right away.

09:09.960 --> 09:12.838
He looked like an idiot with glasses.
Everybody laughed at him.

09:13.040 --> 09:14.439
Ruined his life.

09:14.640 --> 09:17.757
I think he ended up in an institution
or something.

09:18.600 --> 09:21.751
It's a sad story, I guess.
I don't know.

09:25.960 --> 09:29.839
- Is there a point to all this?
- Yes, there is.

09:30.040 --> 09:32.759
Now, if a guy who had everything
to live for got glasses...

09:32.960 --> 09:36.157
...then there is certainly
no reason for you not to.

09:39.080 --> 09:42.311
For to see is more important
than to be.

09:51.320 --> 09:54.039
You're never leaving home, are you?

09:55.360 --> 09:57.191
I don't think so.

09:59.640 --> 10:00.868
We have a winner.

10:01.080 --> 10:02.957
The answer to our quiz
was Frank Ramsey.

10:03.160 --> 10:06.550
Congratulations today's winner,
Bud Bundy.

10:14.520 --> 10:18.957
Well, let's go out
and get old Dad some glasses.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.388
What for?

10:20.600 --> 10:24.354
So I can see the expression
on your face when I'm choking you.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.509
- I can't.
- No, you do have to.

10:41.720 --> 10:43.358
I don't wanna be a Poindexter.

10:45.480 --> 10:48.790
Relax, Dad. You know,
plenty of cool guys wear glasses.

10:49.400 --> 10:51.391
I'm Wally.

10:57.080 --> 11:00.117
Please don't want me, I'm married.

11:00.760 --> 11:03.320
Good, then there's hope
for my brother.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.753
Now, Daddy,
show him your prescription.

11:13.560 --> 11:17.109
Can you see me?

11:17.560 --> 11:19.278
Just give me some glasses.

11:20.200 --> 11:21.599
Of course, sir.

11:21.800 --> 11:27.272
You just go through our veritable
myriad of hip and trendy frames.

11:27.520 --> 11:31.433
Mine, for instance,
are from our Casanova line.

11:32.000 --> 11:37.438
You know, I get more chicks
than my friend who's a dry cleaner.

11:39.920 --> 11:42.957
Kids, listen. I need some help
picking out my frames.

11:43.160 --> 11:46.357
I'm afraid I may not know
what cool is anymore.

11:46.560 --> 11:48.915
You lie.

11:50.200 --> 11:54.990
I mean, the shirt, the pants
and those shoes.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.919
Now surely, those are no accident.

11:58.240 --> 12:03.109
No, no, on clothes I'm confident,
but I need help with the glasses.

12:03.320 --> 12:05.197
See, I'm counting on you guys
to help me...

12:05.400 --> 12:07.630
...pick out something cool
yet understated.

12:07.840 --> 12:10.229
Count on us, big guy.

13:43.240 --> 13:44.992
Buck...

13:47.840 --> 13:50.912
...may I present the man
with the goo-goo-googly eyes...

13:51.120 --> 13:53.270
...Specs Bundy.

14:00.280 --> 14:03.955
I can't believe how cool
I look, eh, kids?

14:05.920 --> 14:07.273
Pretty proud moment, eh, Kel?

14:07.480 --> 14:10.392
This is how the young Redenbachers
must feel.

14:11.440 --> 14:13.158
Hey kids, watch this.

14:13.360 --> 14:15.157
TV Guide, s'il v ous plait.

14:19.800 --> 14:23.793
There he is, big as life,
Raymond Burr.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.389
It's Delta Burke, Dad.

14:27.160 --> 14:30.755
Delta Burke, Raymond Burr,
city of Seattle. What's the difference?

14:32.520 --> 14:35.080
Now, who wants to take a ride
with Daddy in the car...

14:35.280 --> 14:38.192
...and read some billboards
from very long distance?

14:38.440 --> 14:42.399
Wow, you mean a chance to cruise
in the dad-mobile?

14:42.600 --> 14:44.556
Listen, Dad, if we pick up
on some chicks...

14:44.760 --> 14:50.039
...will you put your sunglasses on
and say, "You is one fine woman"?

14:51.640 --> 14:55.110
Yeah, I'll go too, Daddy, but only if
we can cruise by some of my friends...

14:55.320 --> 14:57.675
...and you stick out your teeth
like a horse and go:

14:57.880 --> 15:00.599
"Hi, girls, I'm Kelly's dad."

15:08.000 --> 15:11.231
So you're suddenly ashamed
to be seen with old Dad, huh?

15:11.440 --> 15:13.590
Well, I wouldn't say suddenly.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.991
You know, you people reek.

15:17.200 --> 15:20.954
What's bothering you is not that
I have glasses, but that I'm happy.

15:21.160 --> 15:22.912
Well, get ready for a life of misery...

15:23.120 --> 15:26.430
...because I shall continue to be happy
with my new twenty-twenty vision.

15:26.640 --> 15:28.790
Now, I'm about to go out...

15:29.000 --> 15:32.959
...and partake of some of the beauty
which our fair city affords us.

15:33.320 --> 15:37.438
If you need me,
I'll be at the nudie bar.

15:46.160 --> 15:48.196
Yeah, babe, well, I guess
old Grandmaster B...

15:48.400 --> 15:50.675
...can fit you into his schedule.

15:54.280 --> 15:56.794
Let's see, how's Friday at 9?

15:57.000 --> 15:59.468
Well, 10's okay too.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.474
Well, look, it doesn't
have to be Friday.

16:04.320 --> 16:08.552
Well, then it's settled.
I'll call you again.

16:08.920 --> 16:10.433
Well...

16:11.440 --> 16:14.910
Well, do you have any idea when
hell is supposed to freeze over?

16:16.200 --> 16:17.838
Hello?

16:21.680 --> 16:24.638
There, there, Cross-dresser B.

16:28.040 --> 16:31.510
Real close, Kel. It's Grandmaster B.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.151
I didn't mean to insult you,
Grandpappy B...

16:35.360 --> 16:37.635
...but I do have something
that might cheer you up.

16:38.320 --> 16:41.278
You make customer of the week
at the free clinic again?

16:45.800 --> 16:48.837
You're quite a jester, Bell-ringer B.

16:50.400 --> 16:53.073
Anyhow, I was doing
a little research...

16:53.280 --> 16:56.511
Well, actually I was talking to
the girls about how ugly you are.

16:56.720 --> 16:58.790
- And it came to light
that Mother Nature...

16:59.000 --> 17:01.514
...has yet to play
its cruellest joke on you.

17:01.720 --> 17:04.518
Now, we knew, way back when,
when you were a baby...

17:04.720 --> 17:07.996
...that you'd be like Dad
and be bald when you're 20.

17:08.200 --> 17:09.679
But guess what.

17:09.880 --> 17:13.634
Odds are you'll be blind
and need glasses too.

17:13.839 --> 17:16.229
Now, just so you're not surprised
when this happens...

17:16.440 --> 17:19.954
...we worked up a little
computer composite of you at 30.

17:27.359 --> 17:30.318
You know, Kel,
I'd draw a picture of you at 25...

17:30.520 --> 17:33.239
...but I don't have
a large enough piece of paper.

17:39.760 --> 17:42.718
Thank God, Dad's home. That should
end the cruelty in this house.

17:43.160 --> 17:45.310
How's it going, bottles?

17:48.440 --> 17:50.749
You know, kids, eyesight is a curse.

17:50.960 --> 17:52.996
You can see everything.

17:54.280 --> 17:58.193
My car, for instance. Have you ever
noticed how ugly Daddy's car is?

17:59.120 --> 18:01.350
Well, you gotta catch it
on the right day.

18:01.560 --> 18:04.028
You know, the sun
glinting off the rust...

18:04.240 --> 18:08.119
...the cloth that you use as a gas cap
flapping gently in the wind...

18:08.320 --> 18:11.437
...as it's being proudly towed
towards its destination.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.476
Yeah, well, try to explain my job.

18:16.680 --> 18:18.113
Now let me tell you something...

18:18.320 --> 18:21.357
...people who work putting shoes
on fat women who wear dresses...

18:21.560 --> 18:24.074
...should not have
twenty-twenty vision.

18:29.960 --> 18:31.871
I saw things on human legs today...

18:32.080 --> 18:35.629
...that would have put a white flag
in Schwarzkopf's hand.

18:37.520 --> 18:40.353
- And you know the worst part?
- You actually saw your paycheque?

18:43.640 --> 18:47.633
Yeah. Yeah, but I sent it back,
because it just can't be right.

18:47.840 --> 18:50.559
Anyhow, every day at 3:00...

18:50.760 --> 18:53.035
...I see this girl that works
at the aerobics shop.

18:53.240 --> 18:55.310
You know, she flirts with me,
I flirt with her.

18:55.520 --> 18:57.715
It's nothing, but it gets
you through the day.

18:58.440 --> 19:01.910
Anyway, I always thought she was
pretty, but today I saw her...

19:02.120 --> 19:04.236
...and she's 40.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.549
I mean, 40. I mean, she's old.

19:08.800 --> 19:10.472
But Dad, you're over 40.

19:10.720 --> 19:13.678
Yeah, but I'm a guy,
so it's totally different, I mean...

19:16.240 --> 19:20.677
No, I mean, I can't believe it.
She's not a girl. She's a woman.

19:20.920 --> 19:22.797
Well, did she like your new glasses?

19:23.040 --> 19:25.952
Well, what the hell do I care
what a 40-year-old woman thinks?

19:27.960 --> 19:29.996
Then I come home.

19:30.520 --> 19:34.354
Home? I mean, look at this place.

19:34.560 --> 19:38.439
Look at that furniture, look...
Look at that table.

19:42.280 --> 19:44.396
What the hell is this?

19:50.280 --> 19:51.918
That... That's Mom, Dad.

19:52.160 --> 19:54.958
Oh, this is just too much.

20:00.080 --> 20:02.275
And look at me.

20:02.840 --> 20:06.549
I got wrinkles.
Now, I never saw those before.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.511
What happened
to the top of my head?

20:14.840 --> 20:17.195
I'm an old man.

20:17.640 --> 20:20.393
My life is really over.

21:22.760 --> 21:24.830
There.

21:25.560 --> 21:27.710
I feel better already.

21:28.040 --> 21:30.315
Al Bundy's back.

21:36.920 --> 21:38.319
Where's my remote control?

21:46.840 --> 21:48.876
You know, kids, this is a lesson.

21:49.080 --> 21:50.957
Now, I may not see too well.

21:51.160 --> 21:54.948
I may kill a few people on the streets
and occasionally drive into a river...

21:55.360 --> 21:57.920
...but it's better than looking stupid.

21:58.120 --> 21:59.599
You know something?

21:59.800 --> 22:02.109
I feel younger already.

22:08.280 --> 22:11.909
I didn't think there was this much
action on Designing Women.
