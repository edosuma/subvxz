<i>[uneasy instrumental music plays]</i>

00:51.166 --> 00:53.333
<i>[young woman]</i>
I'm thinking of ending things.

00:53.875 --> 00:56.166
<i>Once this thought arrives, it stays.</i>

00:56.250 --> 00:59.166
<i>It sticks, it lingers, it dominates.</i>

00:59.875 --> 01:02.125
<i>There's not much I can do about it,</i>
<i>trust me.</i>

01:02.208 --> 01:03.250
<i>It doesn't go away.</i>

01:03.875 --> 01:05.708
<i>It's there whether I like it or not.</i>

01:05.791 --> 01:09.791
<i>It's there when I eat, when I go to bed.</i>
<i>It's there when I sleep, when I wake up.</i>

01:09.875 --> 01:11.500
<i>It's always there. Always.</i>

01:13.208 --> 01:15.375
<i>I haven't been thinking about it for long.</i>

01:15.458 --> 01:16.500
<i>The idea is new.</i>

01:17.333 --> 01:19.083
<i>But it feels old at the same time.</i>

01:19.958 --> 01:21.083
<i>When did it start?</i>

01:21.541 --> 01:23.291
<i>What if this thought</i>
<i>wasn't conceived by me,</i>

01:23.375 --> 01:25.416
<i>but planted in my mind, pre-developed.</i>

01:25.500 --> 01:26.333
<i>[inhales]</i>

01:26.416 --> 01:28.708
<i>Is an unspoken idea unoriginal?</i>

01:29.458 --> 01:31.458
<i>Maybe I've actually known all along.</i>

01:32.000 --> 01:34.333
<i>Maybe this is how</i>
<i>it was always going to end.</i>

01:36.583 --> 01:37.750
<i>Jake once said,</i>

01:38.791 --> 01:41.166
<i>"Sometimes the thought</i>
<i>is closer to the truth,</i>

01:41.625 --> 01:43.500
<i>to reality, than an action.</i>

01:44.125 --> 01:47.750
<i>You can say anything, you can do anything,</i>
<i>but you can't fake a thought."</i>

01:48.750 --> 01:50.375
<i>The road is mostly empty.</i>

01:51.666 --> 01:54.375
<i>It's quiet around here. Vacant.</i>

01:54.458 --> 01:55.958
<i>More so than anticipated.</i>

01:56.375 --> 01:58.208
<i>So much to see, but not many people.</i>

01:58.291 --> 02:00.000
<i>Not many buildings or houses.</i>

02:00.416 --> 02:01.458
<i>Sky.</i>

02:01.541 --> 02:03.500
<i>Trees, fields, fences.</i>

02:04.041 --> 02:06.500
<i>The road and its gravel shoulders.</i>

02:07.958 --> 02:10.791
<i>"You wanna stop for a coffee?"</i>
<i>"I think I'm OK I say.</i>

02:11.625 --> 02:14.458
<i>"Last chance we'll have</i>
<i>before it becomes really farm-y."</i>

02:15.750 --> 02:18.250
<i>I'm visiting Jake's parents</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

02:18.333 --> 02:20.291
<i>Or I will be when we arrive.</i>

02:20.375 --> 02:22.250
<i>Jake, my boyfriend.</i>

02:22.333 --> 02:24.500
<i>He hasn't been my boyfriend for very long.</i>

02:24.583 --> 02:25.791
<i>It's our first trip together.</i>

02:25.875 --> 02:27.875
<i>[inhales] </i>Our first long drive.

02:27.958 --> 02:30.208
<i>So it's weird that I'm feeling nostalgic,</i>

02:30.291 --> 02:32.666
<i>about our relationship,</i>
<i>about him, about us.</i>

02:32.750 --> 02:34.333
<i>[inhales deeply]</i>

02:34.416 --> 02:37.583
<i>I should be excited,</i>
<i>looking forward to the first of many.</i>

02:37.666 --> 02:39.750
<i>But I'm not. Not at all.</i>

02:41.416 --> 02:44.458
<i>I've seen more barns on this drive</i>
<i>than I've seen in years.</i>

02:44.541 --> 02:45.666
<i>Maybe in my life.</i>

02:46.125 --> 02:47.625
<i>They all look the same.</i>

02:47.708 --> 02:50.166
<i>Some cows, some horses, sheep, fields.</i>

02:50.916 --> 02:51.875
<i>And barns.</i>

02:52.541 --> 02:53.750
<i>Such a big sky.</i>

02:56.958 --> 02:59.333
<i>Feels like I've known Jake</i>
<i>longer than I have.</i>

03:00.250 --> 03:01.291
<i>What has it been?</i>

03:02.041 --> 03:03.416
<i>Oh, a month?</i>

03:03.875 --> 03:05.250
<i>Six weeks, maybe seven.</i>

03:05.333 --> 03:08.250
<i>[inhales] </i>I should know exactly.
I'll say seven weeks.

03:08.333 --> 03:10.083
<i>[man's voice speaking indistinctly]</i>

03:12.625 --> 03:16.083
<i>[man] </i>The assumptions are right.
I can feel my fear growing. Now is the--

03:16.166 --> 03:20.208
<i>[young woman] </i>We have a real connection.
A rare and intense attachment.

03:21.166 --> 03:23.250
<i>I've never experienced anything like it.</i>

03:25.125 --> 03:28.500
<i>[man] </i>…growing. Now is the time
for the answer. Just one question.

03:28.916 --> 03:30.416
<i>One question to answer.</i>

03:36.291 --> 03:37.250
<i>It's snowing!</i>

03:37.333 --> 03:38.791
<i>Winter is comin' in!</i>

03:39.750 --> 03:40.666
<i>Yep.</i>

<i>-What?</i>

04:22.250 --> 04:23.375
<i>Did you say something?</i>

04:23.708 --> 04:25.625
<i>[chuckling] No, I don't think so.</i>

04:26.708 --> 04:27.625
<i>Weird.</i>

<i>-Yeah.</i>
<i>-[Jake inhales deeply]</i>

04:29.958 --> 04:31.916
<i>[young woman]</i>
I'm thinking of ending things.

04:32.916 --> 04:35.250
<i>What's the point in carrying on like this?</i>

04:35.333 --> 04:37.291
<i>I know what it is, where it's going.</i>

04:37.791 --> 04:39.875
<i>Jake is a nice guy, but...</i>

04:40.666 --> 04:43.500
<i>it's not going anywhere.</i>
<i>I've known this for a while now.</i>

04:44.375 --> 04:47.833
<i>Maybe it's human nature to keep going</i>
<i>in the face of this knowledge.</i>

04:48.375 --> 04:50.666
<i>The alternative requires too much energy.</i>

04:50.750 --> 04:51.958
<i>Decisiveness.</i>

04:52.666 --> 04:53.500
<i>Hmm.</i>

04:53.583 --> 04:56.500
<i>People stay in unhealthy relationships</i>
<i>because it's easier.</i>

04:56.916 --> 04:58.125
<i>Basic physics.</i>

04:58.583 --> 05:00.791
<i>An object in motion</i>
<i>tends to stay in motion.</i>

05:00.875 --> 05:04.166
<i>People tend to stay in relationships</i>
<i>past their expiration date.</i>

05:04.583 --> 05:06.541
<i>It's Newton's first law of emotion.</i>

05:06.625 --> 05:09.583
<i>Do you want to stop for a coffee</i>

05:09.666 --> 05:11.666
<i>or something, a... a snack?</i>

05:11.750 --> 05:13.708
<i>It's... it's going to get pretty farm-y</i>

05:13.791 --> 05:16.000
<i>-pretty fast now.</i>
<i>-No, no, no, I'm... I'm fine.</i>

05:16.083 --> 05:17.541
<i>-You sure?</i>
<i>-[young woman] Mm-hmm.</i>

05:17.625 --> 05:20.083
<i>Don't want to spoil my appetite.</i>
<i>[slight chuckle]</i>

05:20.166 --> 05:21.083
<i>[chuckles]</i>

05:22.500 --> 05:23.375

05:49.125 --> 05:49.958
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

05:50.041 --> 05:53.333
<i>I'm just saying</i>
<i>that there might not be much of a spread,</i>

05:53.416 --> 05:56.041
<i>that she might not be up to</i>
<i>a lot of cooking.</i>

<i>it would probably be fine...</i>

06:09.708 --> 06:10.625
<i>um...</i>

06:12.041 --> 06:13.541
<i>in terms of appetite spoiling.</i>

<i>I'm really looking forward</i>

06:54.416 --> 06:57.541
<i>[young woman] </i>Maybe it's unfair of me

<i>when I'm so uncertain about our future,</i>
<i>our lack of it.</i>

07:02.375 --> 07:04.416
<i>After all, going to meet</i>
<i>your boyfriend's parents</i>

07:04.500 --> 07:06.625
<i>is the proverbial next step, isn't it?</i>

07:06.708 --> 07:09.625
<i>The truth is, I haven't even</i>
<i>told my parents I'm dating Jake.</i>

07:09.708 --> 07:12.458
<i>I've never mentioned him,</i>
<i>and I don't think I ever will.</i>

<i>[Jake] True, although...</i>

<i>with her use of the word sissy...</i>

07:23.708 --> 07:26.500
<i>-Yeah, of course. Yeah. Yes, sir.</i>
<i>-[Jake] ...as a pejorative.</i>

07:27.333 --> 07:28.583
<i>It was a different time.</i>

07:29.875 --> 07:31.875
<i>[young woman] </i>I guess it's curiosity.

07:33.416 --> 07:35.125
<i>Jake is certainly hard to figure.</i>

07:36.375 --> 07:38.500
<i>Maybe it's like a window into his origins.</i>

07:39.208 --> 07:41.333
<i>The child being father of the man and all.</i>

07:41.416 --> 07:43.250
<i>Are you a fan of Wordsworth, then?</i>

07:55.625 --> 07:57.500
<i>-[chuckles]</i>
<i>-He popped into my head.</i>

07:57.583 --> 07:58.750
<i>[exhales]</i>

07:58.833 --> 08:04.375
<i>His poem </i>Ode: Intimations of Immortality

<i>-Jesus, that's the title?</i>
<i>-[Jake chuckles]</i>

08:06.250 --> 08:08.708
<i>-[chuckles] Sounds like an entire poem.</i>
<i>-Well…</i>

08:15.166 --> 08:17.916
<i>-[young woman] </i>I'm thinking of--
<i>-Get your words' worth with Wordsworth.</i>

<i>[imitates gunshot] Fired.</i>

<i>-It's just that the--</i>
<i>-I'm not a metaphorical-type gal.</i>

08:26.791 --> 08:28.666
<i>It's just that that one speaks to me.</i>

08:30.500 --> 08:34.875
<i>Uh, incidentally, Wordsworth wrote</i>
<i>a series of poems to a woman named Lucy.</i>

08:37.291 --> 08:38.333
<i>Like me!</i>

<i>-we just passed?</i>
<i>-What swing set?</i>

09:31.291 --> 09:33.208
<i>It was weird.</i>
<i>It was this beautiful new swing set</i>

09:33.291 --> 09:34.916
<i>in front of an abandoned house.</i>

09:35.000 --> 09:37.166
<i>-No. I missed it.</i>
<i>-What?</i>

09:37.250 --> 09:38.375
<i>I didn't see it.</i>

09:38.458 --> 09:39.791
<i>Why would that be there?</i>

09:39.875 --> 09:41.958
<i>I mean, clearly no one's lived</i>
<i>in that house for years.</i>

09:42.041 --> 09:44.875
<i>Someone's moving in, and...</i>

09:45.416 --> 09:48.750
<i>they brought the swing set first?</i>
<i>That's all I can think of.</i>

09:50.875 --> 09:52.000
<i>-I--</i>
<i>-[young woman] That seems</i>

<i>like an unlikely sequence of events.</i>

09:56.208 --> 09:59.041
<i>[exhales] You know, like,</i>
<i>to have something</i>

<i>-there might be a fair amount of snow.</i>
<i>-Yeah?</i>

10:10.166 --> 10:11.666
<i>They're predicting it.</i>

10:12.250 --> 10:14.208
<i>Do you think we should maybe turn back?</i>

10:15.875 --> 10:17.291
<i>I've got a fair amount of...</i>

<i>of work to do tomorrow.</i>

<i>-Oh...</i>

10:56.500 --> 10:59.125

<i>That's a good thing.</i>
<i>It's in the pro column.</i>

11:17.583 --> 11:20.083

20:08.291 --> 20:09.666
<i>-Really?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

20:11.666 --> 20:14.333
<i>Like we're on a train</i>

<i>There's no veering off,</i>
<i>there's no side trips,</i>

20:16.583 --> 20:18.750
<i>and like Mussolini's train,</i>
<i>it runs on time.</i>

20:18.833 --> 20:21.541

20:24.875 --> 20:26.666

<i>And even still,</i>

20:29.583 --> 20:31.666
<i>I wasn't really talking</i>

21:10.791 --> 21:12.375
