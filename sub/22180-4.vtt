WEBVTT

00:03.179 --> 00:05.782
- You're ready early.
- Hey.

00:05.783 --> 00:08.016
Have you seen a report
on economic growth

00:08.018 --> 00:10.653
in Central Asia? I...

00:10.654 --> 00:12.158
Thought you fell asleep
with it last night.

00:12.159 --> 00:13.857
No, it's not up there.

00:13.858 --> 00:15.925
Call me a dummy, but I thought
the government shutdown's

00:15.926 --> 00:18.395
- supposed to slow things
down a little bit? - Ha.

00:18.396 --> 00:21.331
Well, it turns out when Congress

00:21.332 --> 00:22.932
attacks foreign aid

00:22.933 --> 00:25.335
and furloughs a third of my staff,

00:25.336 --> 00:26.903
it's not much of a vacation.

00:26.904 --> 00:28.838
Sorry, I'm not snapping at you.

00:28.839 --> 00:31.074
Ugh! It's okay there, tiger.

00:31.075 --> 00:32.308
I understand the frustration.

00:32.308 --> 00:34.310
Two weeks of one senator

00:34.311 --> 00:36.946
holding the entire government hostage

00:36.947 --> 00:38.648
over some ideological notion

00:38.649 --> 00:41.885
of eliminating the national debt?

00:41.886 --> 00:43.553
We're two days out from Paris, babe.

00:43.554 --> 00:45.221
- Smell the butter.
- Oh, sure.

00:45.222 --> 00:49.292
You can be all Zen about it...
your budget wasn't affected.

00:49.293 --> 00:52.962
"Intelligence is essential
for national security,"

00:52.963 --> 00:56.800
but international
programs that save lives...

00:56.801 --> 00:58.435
the world's most vulnerable

00:58.436 --> 01:01.304
gov... ernment... Wow.

01:01.305 --> 01:03.673
I booked us a table at
this beautiful little place

01:03.674 --> 01:05.842
- in Montmartre.
- Oh, that's good.

01:05.843 --> 01:07.644
And you're gonna get all the churches

01:07.645 --> 01:10.280
our of your system while
I'm at the conference, right,

01:10.281 --> 01:11.681
so we can have all day Sunday?

01:11.682 --> 01:14.184
Well, there is a mass
on Sunday at St. Gervais,

01:14.185 --> 01:15.251
which I'm totally skipping

01:15.252 --> 01:16.820
so that we can order room service

01:16.821 --> 01:19.189
Okay, good. We can have
croissants on the balcony.

01:19.190 --> 01:20.824
Afternoon walk in the Tuileries.

01:20.825 --> 01:23.059
Mm. And I want to get that hot chocolate

01:23.060 --> 01:25.028
from the place with
all the tourists. Oh...

01:25.029 --> 01:27.831
Oh, go deeper. Right there, even deeper.

01:27.832 --> 01:28.798
Oh, wow. Oh...

01:28.799 --> 01:30.333
- Jace.
- Hey. No.

01:30.334 --> 01:32.268
- Mom just has a few kinks.
- Come back.

01:32.269 --> 01:33.536
No, Dad...

01:33.537 --> 01:34.971
No, it's-it's worse
when you talk about it.

01:34.972 --> 01:37.974
- Don't...
- Come here. Come here.

01:37.975 --> 01:40.777
I'm gonna miss you this weekend.

01:40.778 --> 01:42.712
Listen, don't worry
because Stevie and Ali

01:42.713 --> 01:43.947
- will be here...
- No, don't say "babysit."

01:43.948 --> 01:45.682
- Hey, he's 16 years old.
- I was just

01:45.683 --> 01:50.286
going to say "to peer supervise."

01:50.287 --> 01:52.922
Oh, hey, so I'm doing a big report

01:52.923 --> 01:54.858
on U.S. history right now on the CIA,

01:54.859 --> 01:57.794
and I'm not asking you any
questions you can't answer,

01:57.795 --> 01:59.262
but if there's any help you can get me

01:59.263 --> 02:01.130
between now and next Wednesday

02:01.131 --> 02:02.232
that's not gonna compromise

02:02.233 --> 02:03.633
your security clearance,

02:03.634 --> 02:05.435
it might help me get an "A."

02:05.436 --> 02:07.537
Not that I'm begging.

02:07.538 --> 02:08.872
Sure, I'd love to sit down

02:08.872 --> 02:11.074
- and talk about it.
- Really?

02:11.075 --> 02:12.141
How's, uh...

02:12.142 --> 02:13.843
I don't know, how about tonight?

02:13.844 --> 02:14.978
Awesome. Thanks.

02:14.979 --> 02:15.987
You know what would be great for this

02:15.988 --> 02:18.014
is, uh, the Spy Museum.

02:18.015 --> 02:20.083
That is an excellent idea.

02:20.084 --> 02:21.807
I've been meaning to check it out.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.353
I'm sure I could learn
a thing or two myself.

02:23.354 --> 02:24.554
Oh, right,

02:24.555 --> 02:26.356
because you have no
experience in intelligence.

02:26.357 --> 02:28.791
I have some time this afternoon,

02:28.792 --> 02:30.660
like 4:00... you want to meet there?

02:30.661 --> 02:33.596
Yeah. Cool.

02:33.597 --> 02:35.031
All right.

02:35.032 --> 02:37.367
Look at the two of you
bonding over espionage.

02:37.368 --> 02:39.769
It's the D.C. equivalent of
building a pinewood derby car.

02:40.671 --> 02:43.439
Oh, ah... Look at that.

02:43.440 --> 02:45.575
Look at that catch.

02:46.877 --> 02:48.244
Uh-oh.

02:48.245 --> 02:50.647
Something elevator-worthy?

02:50.648 --> 02:52.515
Itinerary for the Global
Economic Conference

02:52.516 --> 02:53.750
in Paris this weekend,

02:53.751 --> 02:55.818
top five résumés for
your new chief of staff,

02:55.819 --> 02:57.887
and a latte, extra foam.

02:57.888 --> 02:59.856
Oh, that is definitely elevator-worthy.

02:59.857 --> 03:01.958
But you didn't pay for this
out of your own money, did you?

03:01.959 --> 03:05.361
There's a slush fund
for essentials, ma'am.

03:05.362 --> 03:07.964
Beginning to wonder if I
need those résumés, Blake.

03:07.965 --> 03:10.333
No, no, please don't joke.

03:10.334 --> 03:12.235
Just filling in for
Nadine during this shutdown

03:12.236 --> 03:14.604
is giving me a stress rash.

03:14.605 --> 03:16.839
Put in some years in the field

03:16.840 --> 03:19.842
or making policy, and you, too...

03:19.843 --> 03:20.977
- I mean it.
- Yeah.

03:20.978 --> 03:22.378
- You could do it.
- I've seen these résumés.

03:22.379 --> 03:24.614
But my mother thanks
you for believing in me.

03:24.615 --> 03:25.949
Morning.

03:25.950 --> 03:27.283
Morning. Morning.

03:27.284 --> 03:29.953
Wow.

03:29.954 --> 03:32.956
I am not used to how
empty it is in here.

03:32.957 --> 03:35.692
Yeah. It's like we missed

03:35.693 --> 03:37.727
the last chopper out of Saigon.

03:37.728 --> 03:39.028
Office of the Secretary of State.

03:39.029 --> 03:41.364
That's a little grim.

03:41.365 --> 03:44.267
Sorry, I was just on
with my ex-mother-in-law.

03:44.268 --> 03:45.768
Abby's at a work conference this week,

03:45.769 --> 03:47.403
which I told her she
could go to months ago,

03:47.404 --> 03:50.306
but now the state's
day care is shut down,

03:50.307 --> 03:52.609
and I'm leaning on her mom pretty hard.

03:52.610 --> 03:55.945
Well, that sounds sticky.

03:55.946 --> 03:58.448
You know what they
don't do at Diplotots?

03:58.449 --> 04:01.417
Give me passive-aggressive
guilt trips about my work hours.

04:02.853 --> 04:05.622
Well...

04:05.623 --> 04:09.292
You know what? Bring Chloe in tomorrow.

04:09.293 --> 04:11.527
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:11.528 --> 04:13.196
I mean, why not?

04:13.197 --> 04:16.798
We could use a little life around here.

04:16.800 --> 04:19.469
Hey, will you, uh, do me a favor

04:19.470 --> 04:21.571
and take a look at these
résumés, will you?

04:21.572 --> 04:23.640
Sure. New chief of staff?

04:23.641 --> 04:25.708
- Well...
- Ooh, not him.

04:25.709 --> 04:28.378
Big blur of accomplishments.

04:28.379 --> 04:30.179
I don't know.

04:30.180 --> 04:32.782
I think I have to figure out

04:32.783 --> 04:34.083
what it is I'm looking for.

04:34.084 --> 04:37.153
Okay. What are you looking for?

04:37.154 --> 04:40.690
Well, you know...

04:40.691 --> 04:43.793
a total pro who's called to serve.

04:43.794 --> 04:47.463
Team player, but also a leader.

04:47.464 --> 04:51.701
And then... something else.

04:51.702 --> 04:53.136
I don't know.

04:53.137 --> 04:54.937
My money's on the head of the
Committee for Human Rights.

04:54.938 --> 04:57.073
She's essentially Nadine 2.0.,

04:57.074 --> 05:00.143
complete with "creative
professional" styling.

05:00.144 --> 05:02.612
Senate Foreign Relations Chief of Staff?

05:02.613 --> 05:04.580
Oh, yeah, that...

05:04.581 --> 05:07.050
that came from, uh, from Russell.

05:07.051 --> 05:11.087
He thinks this guy could give
us the inside track on Congress.

05:11.088 --> 05:13.756
We could promote our
acting chief of staff.

05:13.757 --> 05:15.391
Wh-what? Really? You want the guy

05:15.392 --> 05:17.560
who does coffee and phone calls

05:17.561 --> 05:20.596
in charge of setting the
U.S. foreign policy agenda?

05:20.597 --> 05:23.166
This is like that nightmare
where I walk on stage naked

05:23.167 --> 05:24.767
in a play I've never heard of.

05:24.768 --> 05:26.969
He's getting a stress rash.

05:26.970 --> 05:29.272
Yes. Can we please just sit down?

05:29.273 --> 05:32.375
Okay, there has been a surge of protests

05:32.376 --> 05:35.645
from international students
attempting to enter the U.S.

05:35.646 --> 05:38.081
to begin their studies,
who are unable to

05:38.082 --> 05:41.250
due to the suspension
of the visa programs.

05:41.251 --> 05:42.819
Getting pressure from Commerce, too.

05:42.820 --> 05:44.020
They're asking for special visas

05:44.021 --> 05:45.321
for highly skilled workers.

05:45.322 --> 05:49.058
Well, we can tell Commerce
to put pressure on Congress.

05:49.059 --> 05:51.327
They're the ones shutting
down the government.

05:51.328 --> 05:53.863
There have been several
cases of Ebola diagnosed

05:53.864 --> 05:55.006
in Sierra Leone.

05:55.006 --> 05:56.833
That's horrifying.
Who do we have on it?

05:56.834 --> 05:59.001
Ambassador Henderson was the
Ebola Coordinator in 2014,

05:59.002 --> 06:01.404
but she's on furlough,
so we can't even reach out

06:01.405 --> 06:02.872
for a list of her international partners

06:02.873 --> 06:06.675
or we violate the rules of the shutdown.

06:09.912 --> 06:12.181
Oh...

06:12.182 --> 06:13.716
- You're not supposed to be home yet.
- Ah.

06:13.717 --> 06:15.418
Lovely to see you, too.

06:15.419 --> 06:17.253
Sorry.

06:17.254 --> 06:19.255
This was supposed to be a surprise.

06:19.256 --> 06:20.690
It's steak and kidney pie.

06:20.691 --> 06:22.925
Except, you know, with
no steak and no kidney.

06:22.926 --> 06:26.562
That is oddly adorable.
You can just say it.

06:26.563 --> 06:29.532
I... I have way too
much time on my hands.

06:29.533 --> 06:31.583
Well, I had a thought
about that, actually.

06:31.584 --> 06:32.547
Mm-hmm.

06:32.548 --> 06:36.172
So, it's my grandmother's
80th birthday next week.

06:36.173 --> 06:38.541
- Fun grandma or tough grandma?
- Imogen.

06:38.542 --> 06:40.343
Fun after a couple of glasses of sherry.

06:40.344 --> 06:42.645
Any case, she offered
to fly me out weeks ago,

06:42.646 --> 06:43.780
and I said no.

06:43.781 --> 06:45.848
But then I was thinking
you're not working...

06:45.849 --> 06:47.884
Maybe we could go together.

06:47.885 --> 06:49.485
I'd use my air miles for your flight.

06:49.486 --> 06:51.854
You want to fly to England
in less than a week?

06:51.855 --> 06:54.423
Oh, I'm sorry to impinge
on all of your pie making.

06:54.424 --> 06:56.425
It could be good for us, you know.

06:56.426 --> 06:59.729
- See the family.
- Yeah.

06:59.730 --> 07:01.364
You know, 'cause they love me so much.

07:01.365 --> 07:03.266
They haven't spent enough time with you.

07:03.267 --> 07:05.368
Jareth, I don't know.

07:05.369 --> 07:07.953
I know you're miserable in
England, so I was thinking

07:07.954 --> 07:09.839
if at any point anyone's
being horrible to you,

07:09.840 --> 07:11.106
you can just do this.

07:12.275 --> 07:13.409
Huh?

07:13.410 --> 07:15.011
I've been working on the gesture.

07:15.012 --> 07:16.579
Is it a bit much?

07:16.580 --> 07:19.715
Uh, no, I like it.

07:19.716 --> 07:20.783
More wrist.

07:20.784 --> 07:23.186
Okay.

07:23.187 --> 07:26.388
Throw up the distress signal,
I will promptly come rescue you.

07:27.790 --> 07:32.028
I mean... you know,
sure, okay, what the hell?

07:32.029 --> 07:34.130
- Let's go to England.
- Yeah!

07:36.533 --> 07:39.368
The British foreign secretary
has requested that you...

07:39.369 --> 07:42.271
Morning. Bess, could I have a word?

07:42.272 --> 07:44.707
It's like a hawk catching a field mouse.

07:46.443 --> 07:47.844
Are you gonna get that or what?

07:47.845 --> 07:49.312
I'd, uh, offer you some coffee,

07:49.313 --> 07:52.481
but, well, apparently we don't have any.

07:52.482 --> 07:55.218
I don't need any help
ratcheting up my blood pressure.

07:55.219 --> 07:56.252
Mm.

07:56.253 --> 07:58.287
No movement on the budget amendment?

07:58.288 --> 08:01.357
Senator Morejon's got his whole
party wrapped up in his web.

08:01.358 --> 08:04.894
Or maybe we're the ones wrapped
up, I get lost in the metaphors.

08:04.895 --> 08:08.331
We offered to put Conrad's
VA hospital on hold,

08:08.332 --> 08:11.334
agreed to a pay freeze for
senior civil servants...

08:11.335 --> 08:12.935
Oh, yeah, 'cause they're so overpaid.

08:12.936 --> 08:15.738
They still want to gut Medicaid
and housing, education...

08:15.739 --> 08:18.541
Well, I'm guessing this
isn't the time, then,

08:18.542 --> 08:20.443
to ask for emergency funds

08:20.444 --> 08:23.546
to stop another outbreak
of Ebola in West Africa...

08:23.547 --> 08:27.083
Not until we take care of Morejon.

08:27.084 --> 08:30.987
Research has it that the
rest of his cabal caves

08:30.988 --> 08:33.722
if we can take out their dark leader.

08:33.724 --> 08:36.025
Do I even want to ask
what you're planning?

08:36.025 --> 08:37.827
It's a multiple-front assault.

08:37.828 --> 08:39.261
Everyone's got a part to play.

08:39.263 --> 08:41.731
What's the one thing you
have and Morejon doesn't?

08:41.732 --> 08:43.065
A conscience?

08:43.066 --> 08:45.501
An approval rating.

08:45.502 --> 08:47.136
No, I don't have the instincts for this.

08:47.137 --> 08:48.671
We'd like to get you out in public...

08:48.672 --> 08:50.806
- I don't...
- ...shining a light on all the ways

08:50.807 --> 08:52.341
the shutdown hurts the American people.

08:52.342 --> 08:54.076
- Make sure you put the blame
squarely on Morejon. - I can't...

08:54.077 --> 08:56.512
- I can't talk politics, Russell.
- Why?!

08:56.513 --> 09:02.051
Because I can't... I can't, I...

09:02.052 --> 09:05.421
What about the 12% of Americans
who think I'm a murderer?

09:05.422 --> 09:07.723
79% find you likeable for some reason.

09:07.724 --> 09:10.526
I'm not asking you to
run for office... yet.

09:10.527 --> 09:11.928
Just get out there.

09:11.929 --> 09:13.429
Put some public pressure on Morejon.

09:13.430 --> 09:15.598
He wanted a shutdown. Let him own it.

09:15.599 --> 09:17.600
I don't know if you
noticed, but Matt and Daisy,

09:17.601 --> 09:18.701
they're on furlough.

09:18.702 --> 09:20.903
I don't have a
communications staff, so...

09:20.904 --> 09:22.138
It's done, it's done.

09:22.139 --> 09:24.640
I had my office set up a
press conference for 2:00.

09:24.641 --> 09:26.975
Knock 'em dead.

09:28.611 --> 09:31.513
I thought that was your job.

09:33.482 --> 09:35.450
I'm on it.

09:37.887 --> 09:39.055
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:39.056 --> 09:40.888
I hear you're headed to Paris tomorrow.

09:40.889 --> 09:42.860
Yeah, just for the weekend.
I'm joining my wife.

09:42.861 --> 09:44.028
I like a nice Bordeaux,

09:44.029 --> 09:45.296
in case you are curious.

09:45.297 --> 09:47.165
I'm not, but thanks.

09:47.166 --> 09:49.200
So, you got something on Afghanistan?

09:49.201 --> 09:51.435
Agent Nafisa thought she
was making first contact

09:51.436 --> 09:53.905
with our guy, Osip Bakunin,

09:53.906 --> 09:55.273
but it turns out he was ready to talk.

09:55.274 --> 09:57.809
- What's this?
- It's a complete list of weapons

09:57.810 --> 10:00.678
from the last three
Russian arms deliveries

10:00.679 --> 10:02.113
to the Taliban.

10:02.114 --> 10:04.148
Looks like Alexander chose
the right guy to flip.

10:04.149 --> 10:05.650
Hey, how's he doing?

10:05.651 --> 10:07.151
Alexander? He's fine.

10:07.152 --> 10:09.954
You know, he hates
getting stuck at home.

10:09.955 --> 10:11.789
I know technically we can't go to him

10:11.790 --> 10:12.824
while he's on furlough,

10:12.825 --> 10:14.692
but there's a name in the report...

10:14.693 --> 10:17.028
- the officer who delivered the weapons.
- Yeah. Woland.

10:17.029 --> 10:18.529
- Who is this guy?
- Exactly.

10:18.530 --> 10:19.964
I mean, he's high-ranking,

10:19.965 --> 10:21.532
but there's nothing on
him anywhere in the IC.

10:21.533 --> 10:23.034
It could be an alias.

10:23.035 --> 10:24.235
That's what we were thinking.

10:24.236 --> 10:27.538
You know, Alexander
might have a take on it.

10:27.539 --> 10:31.042
What if I happened to stop by,

10:31.043 --> 10:32.543
see him over the weekend?

10:32.544 --> 10:34.545
Just off the books, run the name by him.

10:34.546 --> 10:36.117
You know what, I'll take it to him.

10:36.118 --> 10:37.066
I don't want you guys

10:37.067 --> 10:39.201
taking any heat for
violating the furlough.

10:39.202 --> 10:40.269
Thanks, this is good work.

10:40.270 --> 10:41.971
Thanks.

10:41.972 --> 10:44.373
You can repay me with free wine.

10:44.374 --> 10:46.542
The shutdown of the federal government

10:46.543 --> 10:49.778
over Senator Morejon's
proposed budget amendments

10:49.779 --> 10:52.114
does far more than postpone travel plans

10:52.115 --> 10:56.118
and close public libraries
and national parks.

10:56.119 --> 10:58.654
It threatens to plunge
us all into a world

10:58.655 --> 11:02.091
further destabilized
by conflict and chaos.

11:02.092 --> 11:06.862
It is no less than a
betrayal of who we are.

11:06.863 --> 11:09.031
I'll take questions.

11:10.200 --> 11:11.867
J-Janine.

11:11.868 --> 11:13.335
Secretary McCord,

11:13.336 --> 11:15.571
how would you answer
Senator Morejon's charge

11:15.572 --> 11:17.640
that your many global trade agreements

11:17.641 --> 11:20.743
are the direct result of
lost jobs here at home?

11:20.744 --> 11:22.511
These global trade agreements

11:22.512 --> 11:25.347
were congressionally
negotiated and approved.

11:25.348 --> 11:27.750
Throwing them back at me is just...

11:27.751 --> 11:29.318
that's just campaigning.

11:29.319 --> 11:31.257
Secretary McCord, do you know a woman

11:31.258 --> 11:34.056
named Rosa Salama, who
entered the United States

11:34.057 --> 11:36.325
as a Honduran refugee?

11:36.326 --> 11:38.027
I'm...

11:38.028 --> 11:40.229
Uh, sorry, I'm not
sure; are you asking me

11:40.230 --> 11:41.931
if I know this individual?

11:41.932 --> 11:43.933
Rosa Salama was jailed
last night in Louisiana

11:43.934 --> 11:45.921
on the charges of first degree homicide

11:45.922 --> 11:48.504
for shooting and killing
an American citizen.

11:48.505 --> 11:49.602
- Can you...?
- I'm on it.

11:49.603 --> 11:51.897
How can you defend
spending U.S. tax dollars

11:51.898 --> 11:54.633
to bring a murderer with
known gang ties to the U.S.?

11:54.634 --> 11:56.235
Can I answer the question?

11:56.236 --> 11:58.504
While I don't know
the particular details

11:58.505 --> 11:59.939
of this incident,

11:59.940 --> 12:03.876
I will emphasize that all
individuals seeking refuge

12:03.877 --> 12:05.044
in the United States

12:05.045 --> 12:06.745
go through extensive vetting...

12:06.746 --> 12:08.114
The whole thing gets hijacked

12:08.115 --> 12:09.915
by some idiot blogger
who thinks he scored

12:09.916 --> 12:11.984
his big "gotcha" moment with
a bunch of made-up nonsense!

12:11.985 --> 12:15.654
Let's just get the details of the case.

12:15.655 --> 12:17.656
Blake's on with Shreveport PD right now.

12:17.657 --> 12:20.960
And if I didn't say this before,
I'm-I'm extremely sorry, ma'am.

12:20.961 --> 12:22.361
Wha...

12:22.362 --> 12:24.363
We're all doing the best that
we can without Daisy here.

12:24.364 --> 12:26.832
Let's stay on top of the story.

12:26.833 --> 12:30.469
I mean, I'm supposed to be
putting pressure on Morejon

12:30.470 --> 12:32.738
to end the shutdown, not
giving him more ammunition.

12:33.874 --> 12:37.943
Ma'am, Russell Jackson's on line one.

12:37.944 --> 12:40.779
Yeah, I'm sure he is.

12:40.780 --> 12:47.710
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#FF0000"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#FF0000"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

12:52.991 --> 12:56.760
I didn't totally fail to
change the narrative, did I?

12:56.761 --> 12:58.128
You shifted it, definitely.

12:58.129 --> 13:00.597
Yeah. From an inspiring
defense of foreign policy

13:00.598 --> 13:02.099
to right-wing refugee panic.

13:03.868 --> 13:05.169
Okay, what-what, why?

13:05.170 --> 13:07.137
Water glasses go on the
left. Which makes no sense

13:07.138 --> 13:09.235
- for right-handed people.
- I don't even know why it's a thing.

13:09.236 --> 13:10.572
- I... just...
- Russell Jackson's right.

13:10.573 --> 13:15.312
I got spun by a blogger.
This is why I hate politics.

13:15.313 --> 13:17.981
Mom, the only people retweeting
that clip are other reporters.

13:17.982 --> 13:19.450
There's a clip?

13:19.451 --> 13:20.951
Can we eat? Alison!

13:20.952 --> 13:24.221
Coming. We have veggie
sauce and non-veggie.

13:24.222 --> 13:25.823
And for what it's worth, Mom,

13:25.824 --> 13:27.891
if anyone was talking
about it at school,

13:27.892 --> 13:30.427
all they would be saying
is how obviously racist

13:30.428 --> 13:31.929
that stupid question was.

13:31.930 --> 13:33.630
I love having you home.

13:33.631 --> 13:35.299
At least you get to escape to Paris.

13:35.300 --> 13:38.368
Oh, where they know nothing
of refugee panic? Ow!

13:38.369 --> 13:40.070
Looks like I'm gonna be traveling, too.

13:40.071 --> 13:42.773
Um, Jareth invited me
to his grandmother's

13:42.774 --> 13:44.708
80th birthday celebration
in England, so...

13:44.709 --> 13:46.143
- Ooh, well, that's fun.
- Well, that's cool.

13:46.144 --> 13:47.578
When do you go?

13:47.579 --> 13:50.302
We haven't booked our flight
yet, but probably this weekend,

13:50.303 --> 13:51.515
- or maybe Monday.
- Whoa. Soon.

13:51.516 --> 13:53.617
Yeah, it's kind of a last-minute idea,

13:53.618 --> 13:55.786
'cause I'm on furlough and
everything, but honestly,

13:55.787 --> 13:57.306
I'm just really dreading
seeing his family again.

13:57.307 --> 13:59.108
Look, if your mom can
win over my family,

13:59.109 --> 14:00.276
you can win over those Brits.

14:00.277 --> 14:01.986
It's all about flatter and pivot.

14:01.987 --> 14:05.223
Say something sweet...
it has to be true...

14:05.224 --> 14:07.191
and then, boom, you're out of there.

14:07.192 --> 14:09.794
So does this mean I'll be
all on my own this weekend?

14:09.795 --> 14:11.262
- No.
- No. Ali will be here.

14:11.263 --> 14:12.330
Uh, yeah, but you're not granting her

14:12.331 --> 14:13.492
any actual authority over me.

14:13.493 --> 14:15.700
Oh, you wait and see. I'm
totally policing your game time.

14:15.701 --> 14:18.936
What? Uh, wait, no. This is
a flagrant abuse of power.

14:18.937 --> 14:21.286
Okay, stop the uprising.

14:21.287 --> 14:22.955
We'll call it mutual supervision.

14:22.956 --> 14:24.556
- How's that?
- See, Mom?

14:24.557 --> 14:25.691
You still got it.

14:27.460 --> 14:29.495
There's a new threat
to the American people.

14:30.373 --> 14:32.799
Elizabeth McCord and her
team of Washington elites

14:32.800 --> 14:34.868
- want to spend your tax dollars
- "Washington elites."

14:34.869 --> 14:37.337
bringing gangsters and
criminals across our borders.

14:37.338 --> 14:39.005
She calls it "refuge."

14:39.006 --> 14:41.074
But when they turn their weapons on us,

14:41.075 --> 14:44.211
Senator Carlos Morejon
calls it what it is: murder.

14:44.212 --> 14:47.614
It's time to send
Globalist McCord a message:

14:47.615 --> 14:49.382
this land is our land.

14:49.383 --> 14:53.153
I hate it when they give away
the whole movie in the trailer.

14:53.154 --> 14:54.888
Jay? I'm calling the FEC.

14:54.889 --> 14:56.089
That has to be a violation.

14:56.090 --> 14:57.324
It's Morejon's own PAC.

14:57.325 --> 14:59.226
It's perfectly legal.

15:00.528 --> 15:02.863
He's still trying to
justify the shutdown.

15:02.864 --> 15:04.631
All you did was defend diplomacy

15:04.632 --> 15:06.766
and humanitarian aid.

15:06.767 --> 15:09.035
We don't offer refuge to criminals.

15:09.036 --> 15:11.037
Rosa Salama fired in self-defense.

15:11.038 --> 15:13.173
Did I mention I hate politics?

15:13.174 --> 15:16.009
What about a counter ad, okay?

15:16.010 --> 15:17.410
- Hi, Dada!
- Hi.

15:17.411 --> 15:20.881
Uh, citing... citing the
crime rate for all refugees,

15:20.882 --> 15:22.215
which is virtually nonexistent.

15:22.216 --> 15:23.683
Let's get the details

15:23.684 --> 15:26.853
of the case out there. We need positive,

15:26.854 --> 15:29.122
inspiring refugee stories.

15:29.123 --> 15:30.690
I mean, that can't be hard. Okay?

15:30.691 --> 15:31.825
Your next interview's here.

15:31.826 --> 15:33.493
- We'll get into it.
- Thanks, guys.

15:33.494 --> 15:34.995
Hey, you!

15:34.996 --> 15:37.130
Come here, you little Washington elite.

15:37.131 --> 15:38.430
Daddy!

15:40.800 --> 15:42.502
This place is not so bad.

15:42.503 --> 15:44.204
Not at all.

15:44.205 --> 15:47.240
I'll admit, I... I didn't
come much with an open mind.

15:47.241 --> 15:48.875
Really?

15:48.876 --> 15:51.578
You know, Greg, my primary
counselor, says that

15:51.579 --> 15:55.015
I need to accept that there
are problems I can't fix myself.

15:55.016 --> 15:57.684
And it makes me stronger to accept help.

15:57.685 --> 15:59.185
Well, given everything
you've been through,

15:59.186 --> 16:00.887
it's not hard to understand
why that's difficult.

16:00.888 --> 16:03.557
There's so much more to
see when you lift your head

16:03.558 --> 16:06.293
from the problems right
in front of you. You know?

16:06.294 --> 16:08.028
I'm like a giraffe,

16:08.029 --> 16:10.564
putting my head above the
trees for the first time.

16:11.766 --> 16:13.567
It's beautiful.

16:13.568 --> 16:16.303
Glad it's helping.

16:16.304 --> 16:17.938
Thank you for coming to see me.

16:17.939 --> 16:19.406
Of course.

16:19.407 --> 16:20.740
I have to tell you,

16:20.741 --> 16:23.209
um...

16:23.210 --> 16:27.113
one of my steps is to make a
list of the people I've hurt.

16:27.114 --> 16:31.459
And the second name on that
list after my sister's was yours.

16:32.034 --> 16:33.501
Come on.

16:33.502 --> 16:35.737
I-I put you at great
risk with my arrogance.

16:35.738 --> 16:39.073
After all you've done for me.

16:39.074 --> 16:41.075
Let's just say that, uh...

16:41.076 --> 16:43.878
I have my share to account for as well.

16:43.879 --> 16:45.847
You gave me my life, Henry.

16:45.848 --> 16:48.850
Even if I can't get my job back,

16:48.851 --> 16:50.418
I will always be grateful to you.

16:50.419 --> 16:52.395
If you keep making such good progress,

16:52.396 --> 16:55.857
there's no reason to believe
you can't come back to work.

16:55.858 --> 16:57.592
And, uh...

16:57.593 --> 16:59.394
to that end,

16:59.395 --> 17:02.030
would you mind if I
ran something by you?

17:02.031 --> 17:05.665
Uh, a name came up with some
Intel we got from Bakunin.

17:07.402 --> 17:09.237
Uh, of course.

17:09.238 --> 17:12.406
This guy...

17:12.407 --> 17:14.576
Woland.

17:14.577 --> 17:16.144
We have no record of him anywhere

17:16.145 --> 17:18.412
in the upper Russian ranks.

17:19.948 --> 17:21.516
It's Yarmolinsky.

17:21.517 --> 17:23.484
Andrei Yarmolinsky.

17:23.486 --> 17:26.186
It's a reference to his favorite
novel The Master and Margarita

17:26.188 --> 17:28.590
by Mikhail Bulgakov.

17:28.591 --> 17:32.360
Um, Professor Woland is basically Satan.

17:32.361 --> 17:35.263
That's quite a reference.

17:35.264 --> 17:36.731
- You feel sure?
- Of course.

17:36.732 --> 17:39.267
He's a high-level operative
for G.R.U., and he happens

17:39.268 --> 17:41.836
to be General Doroshevich's cousin.

17:41.837 --> 17:43.671
Yes, I'm sure.

17:43.672 --> 17:44.839
Thanks for your help.

17:44.840 --> 17:47.475
Of course.

17:47.476 --> 17:49.978
I, uh... Come see me any time

17:49.979 --> 17:51.712
you need help. Um...

17:53.615 --> 17:55.916
I should get back.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.535
How was the interview?

18:13.536 --> 18:16.604
Another super-accomplished candidate

18:16.605 --> 18:19.374
who really wants the job.

18:19.375 --> 18:21.409
I'm sensing ambivalence.

18:21.410 --> 18:24.145
Yeah, I don't know.

18:24.146 --> 18:26.314
I just wasn't feeling it, you know?

18:26.315 --> 18:27.649
Then again, I wasn't feeling it

18:27.650 --> 18:31.586
with Nadine at first, either, so...

18:31.587 --> 18:32.987
Where's Chloe?

18:32.988 --> 18:34.055
Taking a nap.

18:34.056 --> 18:35.256
At least, in theory.

18:35.257 --> 18:36.891
Not sure she's feeling it, either.

18:36.892 --> 18:38.793
So, I found something.

18:38.794 --> 18:40.228
Ma... Mama!

18:40.229 --> 18:44.065
Uh, it's a... it's a...

18:44.066 --> 18:48.036
a toy manufacturing
plant in Peoria, Illinois.

18:48.037 --> 18:50.605
The, uh, owner employs a huge percentage

18:50.606 --> 18:52.735
of Honduran immigrants
making giggledoodles.

18:52.736 --> 18:55.205
Ooh! I had one of those.

18:55.206 --> 18:57.445
- See, those are just the kind of happy
associations that could... - Mama!

18:57.446 --> 18:59.347
...play well on camera.

18:59.348 --> 19:01.916
We could set up a tour with
a small gaggle of press.

19:01.917 --> 19:03.051
- Yeah.
- Jay.

19:03.052 --> 19:04.085
- Chloe... - Yeah.
- I'm on it. Yeah.

19:04.086 --> 19:05.186
- I'm on it. Yes? Fine.
- Yeah.

19:05.187 --> 19:06.788
- Yes? Hmm.
- Yeah. Listen,

19:06.789 --> 19:10.491
will you set up a tour of
that toy factory in Peoria?

19:10.492 --> 19:12.660
Okay? Maybe invite some press, and...

19:12.661 --> 19:15.163
We'll do it Monday, first thing.

19:15.164 --> 19:17.497
- Okay?
- Yeah.

19:20.568 --> 19:22.403
What is it?

19:22.404 --> 19:24.238
As your acting chief of staff,

19:24.239 --> 19:27.675
I feel it's my duty to suggest
this event might play better

19:27.676 --> 19:29.243
in the press than, I don't know,

19:29.244 --> 19:32.279
a global economic conference in Paris?

19:36.684 --> 19:40.755
Somewhere, Russell Jackson
just got a warm, fuzzy feeling.

19:40.756 --> 19:42.690
You're totally right.

19:42.691 --> 19:45.760
Okay. Call Deputy Secretary Cushing.

19:45.761 --> 19:47.395
Tell him that he's
going to the conference.

19:47.396 --> 19:49.464
Let's do Peoria tomorrow.

19:49.465 --> 19:52.600
And find out where Russell Jackson is.

19:52.601 --> 19:54.762
So you can ambush him
without warning, I hope?

19:55.770 --> 19:57.772
Who am I kidding? We always call first.

19:57.773 --> 19:59.130
Blake, Blake, what'd
you do with the wipeys?

19:59.131 --> 20:02.477
Uh, the bag underneath the desk?

20:06.447 --> 20:07.649
Oh, man, man, man.

20:07.650 --> 20:09.150
Yo, thank you so much.

20:09.151 --> 20:10.718
Uncle Matthew to the rescue.

20:10.719 --> 20:12.320
Hey, Chloe.

20:12.321 --> 20:13.888
Hey, what's this guy?

20:13.889 --> 20:15.256
Thanks for getting me past security.

20:15.257 --> 20:17.325
Pretty serious about the furlough.

20:17.326 --> 20:18.459
Uh, are you sure you're cool with this

20:18.460 --> 20:19.827
for the rest of the week, honestly?

20:19.828 --> 20:22.430
Dude, you're saving me
from staring at my novel.

20:22.431 --> 20:24.165
And I would much rather hang out

20:24.166 --> 20:25.400
with my favorite girl.

20:25.401 --> 20:27.101
Don't tell my niece I said that.

20:27.102 --> 20:29.370
So... nap didn't really happen.

20:29.371 --> 20:30.938
There's some leftover
squash in there for dinner,

20:30.939 --> 20:32.807
She likes to have it
with ham, if you have any.

20:32.808 --> 20:34.542
Squash and ham?

20:34.543 --> 20:36.277
That's my favorite, too.

20:36.278 --> 20:39.747
I assume you're all right if
we, uh, watch that attack ad

20:39.748 --> 20:41.349
and hash out some media strategy?

20:41.350 --> 20:43.284
Please send me ideas. Seriously.

20:43.285 --> 20:45.620
It's not like we're
talking shop or anything.

20:45.621 --> 20:47.655
All right. Fist bump?

20:47.656 --> 20:49.057
I'll see you later.

20:49.058 --> 20:50.291
Mwah.

20:50.292 --> 20:52.360
All right. 7:00 at the latest.
I got to go try and stop

20:52.361 --> 20:54.429
an Ebola outbreak
with no money or staff.

20:54.430 --> 20:55.930
- Ooh.
- All right.

20:55.931 --> 20:58.066
See you soon. Be good.

20:58.067 --> 21:00.735
Honduran refugees making toys?

21:00.736 --> 21:03.271
It reminds Americans that
we offer safe sanctuary

21:03.272 --> 21:05.573
and hope for a better life. Plus,

21:05.574 --> 21:06.574
giggledoodles.

21:06.575 --> 21:07.875
I had one of those.

21:07.876 --> 21:09.043
See?

21:09.044 --> 21:10.178
I never played with it.

21:11.914 --> 21:14.115
We already tried appealing
to America's better angels

21:14.116 --> 21:15.516
with the press conference.

21:15.517 --> 21:18.852
That got us an attack ad that's
polling disgustingly well.

21:19.654 --> 21:23.725
My Spidey-sense says
it's time to go low.

21:23.726 --> 21:25.460
Do you have something?

21:25.461 --> 21:28.963
As you know, that's not
always a requirement.

21:28.964 --> 21:31.332
So, trick Morejon into thinking

21:31.333 --> 21:35.870
we have something that we don't
and hang him on the cover-up.

21:35.871 --> 21:37.171
Worked with Craig Sterling.

21:37.172 --> 21:41.175
Not our proudest moment.

21:43.078 --> 21:45.313
Fine.

21:45.314 --> 21:46.814
Try Santa's toy factory.

21:46.815 --> 21:48.316
Plays a hell of a lot better

21:48.317 --> 21:51.519
than a trip to Paris, anyway.

21:51.520 --> 21:53.387
But if Morejon manages to throw this one

21:53.388 --> 21:55.823
back in our face, I'm taking him out.

21:55.824 --> 21:59.226
I'll bring you back a giggledoodle.

22:06.940 --> 22:09.375
Hey, you made it just in time.

22:09.376 --> 22:11.277
Oh, that looks good.

22:11.278 --> 22:13.813
Smell that. Oh, mac and cheese, baby.

22:13.814 --> 22:16.382
I was gonna make boeuf bourguignon,

22:16.383 --> 22:18.618
but I switched the menu
from Paris to Peoria.

22:18.619 --> 22:21.344
No, listen, you-you don't
have to go to this thing.

22:21.345 --> 22:22.221
Yeah?

22:22.222 --> 22:25.258
- And miss my weekend
with you? Mm-mm. - Oh.

22:25.259 --> 22:27.493
Well, we're gonna have to trade in

22:27.494 --> 22:29.328
our little table at Montmartre

22:29.329 --> 22:32.098
- for some cute pancake house.
- Mm-hmm.

22:32.099 --> 22:33.866
That's a sad change in itinerary

22:33.867 --> 22:36.369
for a globalist like yourself.

22:36.370 --> 22:38.271
- Mm, is it?
- Would you set the table, please?

22:38.272 --> 22:42.440
Mwah. Hey, how was the Spy Museum?

22:43.543 --> 22:45.745
I had to postpone.

22:45.746 --> 22:48.314
I needed to go see Alexander
at the treatment center.

22:48.315 --> 22:50.783
Mom! Do you have a carry-on

22:50.784 --> 22:52.151
I can borrow?

22:52.152 --> 22:53.319
Yeah.

22:53.320 --> 22:54.954
My zipper just broke.

22:54.955 --> 22:56.521
Let me see what I have.

23:02.628 --> 23:06.566
This place has a serious
case of the cutes.

23:06.567 --> 23:08.301
Well, wait till you see the
bed-and-breakfast we're in.

23:08.302 --> 23:10.503
That's Angelo Bianchi right here.

23:10.504 --> 23:12.438
He's the owner and operator
of Whiffle-Whaffle Toys.

23:12.439 --> 23:13.840
Okay.

23:13.841 --> 23:14.941
I'll see you at... what's it called?

23:14.942 --> 23:16.108
Kettle and Biscuit.

23:16.109 --> 23:18.277
- Good luck.
- Kettle and Biscuit.

23:18.278 --> 23:19.745
Can you stand it?

23:19.746 --> 23:21.480
Who needs the Champs-Elysées?

23:21.481 --> 23:23.115
Hi, Angelo.

23:23.116 --> 23:24.116
Madam Secretary, it's a pleasure.

23:24.117 --> 23:25.184
Thank you.

23:25.185 --> 23:26.886
On behalf of my employees and staff,

23:26.887 --> 23:29.222
welcome to Whiffle-Whaffle Toys.

23:29.223 --> 23:30.890
- I have something for you.
- Oh!

23:30.891 --> 23:32.892
A giggledoodle!

23:32.893 --> 23:34.994
Just like the one I had as a kid.

23:34.995 --> 23:36.262
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

23:36.263 --> 23:37.230
Please, come in.

23:37.231 --> 23:38.731
Okay.

23:40.734 --> 23:42.835
Come on in.

23:42.836 --> 23:45.271
Hey, baby girl. Hi.

23:45.272 --> 23:47.540
- I'm so sorry.
- No worries, man. It's cool.

23:47.541 --> 23:51.744
More time for beatboxing,
right, Li'l C? Drop it.

23:53.313 --> 23:54.947
Exactly what Abby's mom
thinks I'm doing with her.

23:54.948 --> 23:56.959
Ah, I think Grandma is
going to be very impressed

23:56.960 --> 23:58.951
- by your sick beats.
- Okay.

23:58.952 --> 24:00.386
Thank you.

24:00.387 --> 24:02.321
Is everything okay?

24:02.322 --> 24:04.690
Uh, y-you know, it's just, you know...

24:04.691 --> 24:06.125
Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone,

24:06.126 --> 24:07.593
M. Sec's doing this
press thing in Peoria,

24:07.594 --> 24:09.795
so I had to scramble to
cover Paris. It's just...

24:09.796 --> 24:11.163
So, typical day at State.

24:11.164 --> 24:12.498
Pretty much.

24:12.499 --> 24:15.101
Look, it's none of my business,

24:15.102 --> 24:16.502
but it's obvious M. Sec loves you.

24:16.503 --> 24:18.905
She gets family.

24:18.906 --> 24:21.107
And I think she can handle
you drawing the line.

24:21.108 --> 24:22.942
You think I wanted to work late?

24:22.943 --> 24:25.311
I mean, we're in the
middle of a shutdown, so...

24:25.312 --> 24:26.946
When is it not one crisis after another?

24:26.947 --> 24:28.414
I mean, that's the job.

24:28.415 --> 24:30.850
You can't be a parent in crisis mode.

24:30.851 --> 24:35.086
You got to know when to say stop.

24:35.821 --> 24:37.390
I know.

24:37.391 --> 24:39.225
You're right.

24:39.226 --> 24:41.928
Of the nearly 300 employees here

24:41.929 --> 24:43.930
at Peoria's
Whiffle-Whaffle Toy Factory,

24:43.931 --> 24:46.032
almost a third are Honduran refugees.

24:46.033 --> 24:49.468
They were hired by owner and
chief operator, Angelo Bianchi.

24:49.469 --> 24:50.903
My grandfather came here from Italy

24:50.904 --> 24:53.572
in 1943 with nothing.

24:53.573 --> 24:56.642
But thanks to a government program,

24:56.643 --> 25:00.479
he got a small loan and started
the Whiffle-Whaffle Toy Factory.

25:00.480 --> 25:03.215
So, when I heard about the
refugee program, I thought,

25:03.216 --> 25:06.118
"This is how this whole
business got started."

25:06.119 --> 25:07.753
This is great.

25:07.754 --> 25:09.789
I know, right?

25:09.790 --> 25:12.024
So, I mean, this is the way you
move into the future, you know?

25:12.025 --> 25:14.527
Secretary of State Elizabeth McCord...

25:14.528 --> 25:15.582
That's you.

25:15.583 --> 25:17.711
...to visit these Hondurans
and see how they're settling

25:17.712 --> 25:18.664
into their new town.

25:18.665 --> 25:21.867
When I was a kid, I-I
loved my giggledoodle,

25:21.868 --> 25:23.536
which I might have just

25:23.537 --> 25:24.904
permanently borrowed from my brother.

25:24.905 --> 25:27.707
I love knowing that
giggledoodles are still made

25:27.708 --> 25:28.975
right here in Peoria,

25:28.976 --> 25:31.577
first by Angelo's grandfather from Italy

25:31.578 --> 25:35.481
and now by a whole
new group of Americans.

25:35.482 --> 25:39.285
I like to think you're not just
making a classic, American toy.

25:39.286 --> 25:40.911
You're making a new America,

25:40.912 --> 25:43.756
because America was built by immigrants.

25:43.757 --> 25:48.527
And as long as we continue
to provide a safe environment

25:48.528 --> 25:52.398
for everyone to work and thrive,

25:52.399 --> 25:56.736
well, then we're building our future.

25:56.737 --> 25:58.971
Hopefully with a lot of giggledoodles.

26:00.007 --> 26:02.074
Thank you.

26:05.712 --> 26:09.715
See, this is politics I actually enjoy.

26:09.716 --> 26:11.050
Here's to changing the narrative.

26:14.220 --> 26:17.256
Blake says, "Don't check Twitter."

26:17.257 --> 26:19.992
He knows that's just gonna
make me check Twitter, right?

26:19.993 --> 26:23.529
Or you could not check Twitter.

26:23.530 --> 26:26.699
I find President Dalton
incredibly tone-deaf,

26:26.700 --> 26:28.434
that he's sending his
secretary of state out there

26:28.435 --> 26:31.765
to brag about giving away the
few manufacturing jobs left

26:31.766 --> 26:36.307
in this country to
refugees from Honduras.

26:41.981 --> 26:45.785
Well, I'll say this: he has
impressive response time.

26:45.786 --> 26:47.019
Uh, yeah, speaking of which,

26:47.020 --> 26:48.788
I am turning this off right now

26:48.789 --> 26:53.426
before Russell Jackson calls
and totally ruins our night.

26:53.427 --> 26:55.361
Not ruined at all.

26:55.362 --> 26:57.129
Here's to Peoria.

26:57.130 --> 26:58.531
So, what's it gonna be?

26:58.532 --> 27:00.366
Family steak house or barbeque?

27:00.367 --> 27:02.401
Duh.

27:02.402 --> 27:05.871
Barbeque. I'm gonna text security.

27:05.872 --> 27:08.174
Hey, can I just say
one thing so it's not

27:08.175 --> 27:09.341
hanging over me?

27:09.342 --> 27:10.609
Yeah, sure.

27:10.610 --> 27:14.046
It bothered me that
you cancelled on Jason

27:14.047 --> 27:16.549
to go see Dmitri at rehab.

27:16.550 --> 27:18.284
Alexander.

27:18.285 --> 27:21.053
I'm sure there's a
perfectly good explanation.

27:21.054 --> 27:23.389
I just thought it was crappy for Jason

27:23.390 --> 27:25.024
and I didn't want to sit on it.

27:25.025 --> 27:26.225
I didn't cancel. I postponed.

27:26.226 --> 27:29.962
And-and there was a good explanation.

27:29.963 --> 27:33.687
But good enough to let Jason down?

27:33.688 --> 27:34.934
Babe, I'm not even sure he noticed.

27:34.935 --> 27:37.136
Are you kidding? Did you see how he was

27:37.137 --> 27:38.637
when I asked him?

27:38.638 --> 27:40.539
Something came up at a briefing at work

27:40.540 --> 27:41.640
that couldn't be postponed.

27:41.641 --> 27:42.908
I'll make it up to him.

27:42.909 --> 27:44.275
Okay.

27:46.445 --> 27:47.947
"Okay" what?

27:47.948 --> 27:49.614
No, I'm gonna go get dressed.

27:50.950 --> 27:52.985
Well, it's just, this-this whole thing

27:52.986 --> 27:54.053
with Alexander. I mean, you...

27:54.054 --> 27:55.054
Could we not?

27:55.055 --> 27:57.323
You're putting him above our son.

27:57.324 --> 27:59.811
How many times have you pushed
the kids and me aside for work?

27:59.812 --> 28:01.060
And have I ever

28:01.061 --> 28:02.294
thrown it back at you once?

28:02.295 --> 28:04.396
No. Fair enough.

28:04.397 --> 28:05.798
Then can you please trust me

28:05.799 --> 28:07.266
that if I had to cancel on Jason,

28:07.267 --> 28:09.268
it must've been something
pretty damn important?

28:09.269 --> 28:12.304
Okay, I-I hear you.

28:12.305 --> 28:14.273
I'm just worried about you.

28:14.274 --> 28:16.375
I'm sorry, worried
about me or blaming me?

28:16.376 --> 28:19.078
Look at how you get
when we talk about him.

28:19.079 --> 28:21.380
You're all twisted up.

28:21.381 --> 28:26.619
I know it was terrible that
we abandoned him in Russia.

28:26.620 --> 28:28.320
How many times do you
have to rescue him?

28:28.321 --> 28:31.023
I mean, when is it
finally gonna be enough?

28:31.024 --> 28:32.291
I don't know. Maybe never.

28:32.292 --> 28:34.827
But what that kid went
through, the trauma that he...

28:34.828 --> 28:36.529
that changes you forever

28:36.530 --> 28:37.496
and I did it to him.

28:37.497 --> 28:38.631
It's not about whether or not

28:38.632 --> 28:39.732
you had a part in it.

28:39.733 --> 28:41.367
This is mine to carry.

28:41.368 --> 28:43.402
I'm not crossing any lines.

28:43.403 --> 28:45.337
I am not pushing the kids away.

28:45.338 --> 28:47.106
But I need to ask you
to let me figure out

28:47.107 --> 28:48.641
how to live with it, okay?

28:48.642 --> 28:50.775
Can you do that much?

28:55.878 --> 28:58.128
- Ma'am, ma'am.
- Yeah?

28:58.129 --> 28:59.937
Ebola. First case in
the U.S. just showed up.

28:59.938 --> 29:01.104
- Where?
- Dallas hospital.

29:01.105 --> 29:02.606
An aid worker developed symptoms

29:02.607 --> 29:04.125
shortly after she
returned from West Africa.

29:04.126 --> 29:05.475
Well, did she expose anybody?

29:05.476 --> 29:06.410
She was with her family.

29:06.411 --> 29:07.844
CDC has them all under quarantine.

29:07.845 --> 29:09.479
They've agreed not to
go to the press yet.

29:09.480 --> 29:10.781
Screw the furlough.

29:10.782 --> 29:12.182
Call Ambassador Henderson.

29:12.183 --> 29:14.051
- I want her on this.
- All right, but what if she...

29:14.052 --> 29:15.686
Yeah, I will take the heat for it.

29:15.687 --> 29:17.507
- I'm going to the White House.
- All right.

29:24.494 --> 29:26.330
I think I have a way
to end the shutdown.

29:26.331 --> 29:27.864
No, we're done playing games.

29:27.865 --> 29:30.300
Ebola. There's a woman
in Dallas in quarantine.

29:30.301 --> 29:32.302
This could be the ace
you've been looking for.

29:32.303 --> 29:33.817
I mean, they have to end it now.

29:33.818 --> 29:35.739
It's too late. I'm going with plan "A."

29:35.740 --> 29:39.776
Russell, we don't have
time to play out a scandal.

29:39.777 --> 29:41.245
People are gonna die.

29:41.246 --> 29:42.546
We could be looking at an outbreak.

29:42.547 --> 29:44.448
And let that weasel
look like a white knight

29:44.449 --> 29:45.882
who stopped Ebola? No.

29:45.883 --> 29:47.951
My plan is faster and
gets rid of him for good.

29:47.952 --> 29:49.786
For God's sakes, when
is it going to stop

29:49.787 --> 29:51.088
being about perception?

29:51.089 --> 29:53.023
You think this is a beauty contest?

29:53.024 --> 29:55.826
I am not letting that
puling ideologue dismantle

29:55.827 --> 29:59.463
Conrad's agenda piece by
piece over the next four years.

29:59.464 --> 30:01.198
What I have will be fast and painless,

30:01.199 --> 30:02.499
like putting down a sick dog.

30:02.500 --> 30:04.668
The rest of his little
faction will run for the hills.

30:04.669 --> 30:05.969
So you have something real?

30:05.970 --> 30:07.337
His wife.

30:07.338 --> 30:08.739
- Oh, God.
- Turns out she worked without a visa

30:08.740 --> 30:10.774
when she first came here in '96.

30:10.775 --> 30:13.043
As soon as we corroborate it,
we're dropping it to the press.

30:13.044 --> 30:14.111
Why not use it as leverage?

30:14.112 --> 30:16.113
Why drag the family into it?

30:16.114 --> 30:18.982
Because I want him destroyed
by the same monster he created.

30:18.983 --> 30:21.618
He wanted to whip up his base
against refugees and immigrants,

30:21.619 --> 30:23.620
let them rip him apart.

30:23.621 --> 30:27.524
Thought you'd appreciate
the poetic justice.

30:27.525 --> 30:31.028
If we were neutralizing a
foreign adversary, maybe.

30:31.029 --> 30:34.731
I guess I thought we
were all on the same team.

30:34.732 --> 30:38.302
All enemies, foreign and domestic.

30:38.303 --> 30:40.704
Ebola is not the only
virus we're fighting here.

30:40.705 --> 30:42.139
As soon as we get rid of Morejon,

30:42.140 --> 30:44.975
the rest of us can get back
to governing the nation.

30:44.976 --> 30:49.378
Meantime, I'll put in for
emergency funding for Dallas.

30:54.886 --> 30:56.753
He's gonna try and get us funding.

30:56.754 --> 30:57.988
One of the family members

30:57.989 --> 30:59.790
is sick now, too. It's out in the press.

30:59.791 --> 31:01.425
While I would normally suggest you avoid

31:01.426 --> 31:03.493
Carlos Morejon's Twitter,
you should probably

31:03.494 --> 31:05.329
see that.

31:05.330 --> 31:09.166
"Runaway spending and POTUS
still can't keep Americans safe.

31:09.167 --> 31:11.735
Ebola in the U.S. Thank
you, Mr. President."

31:11.736 --> 31:13.370
There's nothing he won't say.

31:13.371 --> 31:14.504
Both of them.

31:14.505 --> 31:15.439
They can't stop.

31:15.440 --> 31:16.973
"Both," ma'am?

31:16.974 --> 31:18.575
Russell and Morejon.

31:18.576 --> 31:21.311
They're lined up on either side.

31:21.312 --> 31:23.447
It has to stop.

31:23.448 --> 31:25.816
Well, Russell is not gonna stop.

31:25.817 --> 31:28.819
Yeah.

31:28.820 --> 31:29.986
Change of plans, Joe.

31:29.987 --> 31:33.155
Senator Morejon's office.

31:37.394 --> 31:40.830
Excuse me, Senator Morejon?

31:42.466 --> 31:44.735
Secretary McCord, I'd be
happy to schedule a meeting.

31:44.736 --> 31:47.304
Yeah, you're gonna want to
talk to me right now, Senator.

31:47.305 --> 31:48.905
I've got quite a few
colleagues waiting for me.

31:48.906 --> 31:51.208
Then I'll make this quick:
Russell Jackson has some

31:51.209 --> 31:53.477
highly personal information
about a member of your family

31:53.478 --> 31:54.878
and he's about to go to press.

31:54.879 --> 31:56.947
I'd like to work with you to stop that,

31:56.948 --> 31:58.048
but it needs to be now.

31:58.049 --> 31:59.549
I'm flattered that you took time

31:59.550 --> 32:00.717
out of your campaign schedule...

32:00.718 --> 32:03.086
...to bring me his threats in person.

32:03.087 --> 32:05.021
Russell doesn't know I'm here.

32:05.022 --> 32:06.623
And it isn't a threat.

32:06.624 --> 32:09.993
He has proof that your wife
worked illegally in the U.S.

32:09.994 --> 32:11.695
before she was a citizen.

32:11.696 --> 32:15.198
Tell Russell to call me when
he's ready to settle the budget.

32:15.199 --> 32:18.468
You ever seen somebody
die of Ebola, Senator?

32:18.469 --> 32:21.204
They call it hemorrhagic fever because

32:21.205 --> 32:23.974
you literally bleed to
death inside your body.

32:23.975 --> 32:26.710
The virus breaks down your
organs and your cells explode.

32:26.711 --> 32:29.513
Every minute that I am standing here,

32:29.514 --> 32:32.616
we are one minute closer to an outbreak.

32:32.617 --> 32:34.584
All the more reason to
have President Dalton

32:34.585 --> 32:35.752
take the deal...

32:35.753 --> 32:37.120
This is the thing about a deal.

32:37.121 --> 32:38.555
A deal is when each side

32:38.556 --> 32:40.724
gives something and meets in the middle.

32:40.725 --> 32:42.459
What you and your colleagues are doing

32:42.460 --> 32:43.894
is nothing less than extortion.

32:43.895 --> 32:45.862
Quite an accusation
coming from the woman

32:45.863 --> 32:47.330
who came here trying to blackmail me.

32:47.331 --> 32:48.636
Oy...

32:48.637 --> 32:50.145
And while you're schooling me on deals,

32:50.146 --> 32:53.837
explain to me how a $20
trillion national debt

32:53.838 --> 32:56.540
and a $500 billion trade deficit

32:56.541 --> 33:01.178
is a deal that I or any
American should want, huh?

33:01.179 --> 33:03.947
That is gonna sound great
in your stump speech.

33:03.948 --> 33:05.382
But I think you should take the deal

33:05.383 --> 33:07.793
that POTUS offered two weeks ago.

33:07.794 --> 33:12.798
You can tell your base that you
stopped balancing a spreadsheet

33:12.799 --> 33:14.099
so you could save some lives.

33:14.100 --> 33:17.369
I guarantee you it will play in Peoria.

33:17.370 --> 33:20.839
Madam Secretary, I want to remind you

33:20.840 --> 33:22.652
I'm a senator in the
United States Congress.

33:22.653 --> 33:26.022
I'm not some foreign despot
that you can strong-arm.

33:26.023 --> 33:29.693
It seems to me it's your own
strong-arming that got us here.

33:31.762 --> 33:34.330
Look, you can either
dare Russell Jackson

33:34.331 --> 33:35.832
to do his worst,

33:35.833 --> 33:39.568
or you can stand down and we can
all live to fight another day.

33:40.737 --> 33:44.973
You tell Russell Jackson that
this is how enemies are made.

33:54.728 --> 33:56.864
How'd it go?

33:56.865 --> 33:58.599
Well, we'll see.

33:58.600 --> 34:02.903
I either put out a fire or lit a fuse.

34:02.904 --> 34:05.439
Hey.

34:05.440 --> 34:08.641
Do I strong-arm foreign despots?

34:11.545 --> 34:13.947
I would describe you
as firm, but reasonable.

34:13.947 --> 34:15.882
I can live with that.

34:15.884 --> 34:17.050
What's the news from Dallas?

34:17.051 --> 34:18.552
No new cases as of yet.

34:18.553 --> 34:19.853
Not so lucky in Sierra Leone,

34:19.853 --> 34:21.388
but Ambassador Henderson
is doing what she can.

34:21.389 --> 34:22.989
Off the record, of course.

34:22.991 --> 34:24.458
Well, that means our only hope right now

34:24.458 --> 34:25.592
is an end to the shutdown.

34:25.592 --> 34:26.693
To that end, ma'am,

34:26.694 --> 34:28.161
when the State Department does resume

34:28.161 --> 34:30.429
full operations, you're
gonna need a chief of staff.

34:30.431 --> 34:32.599
- A real one.
- Yeah. I don't know.

34:32.600 --> 34:35.569
I don't know why I'm being
so indecisive about that.

34:35.570 --> 34:38.405
They're all so qualified.

34:38.406 --> 34:40.072
If I may?

34:40.074 --> 34:41.208
Russell Jackson's guy

34:41.208 --> 34:42.576
from the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee

34:42.577 --> 34:45.178
looks perfect on paper, but
I worry about his loyalties.

34:45.179 --> 34:47.447
The Human Rights CEO is
an interesting outlier,

34:47.447 --> 34:49.248
but she has no idea
what the job entails,

34:49.250 --> 34:51.284
and one of her staffers
hesitated when I asked

34:51.286 --> 34:52.552
how she does under pressure.

34:52.553 --> 34:54.353
Oh. This job is nothing but pressure.

34:54.355 --> 34:56.590
I'd put my money on Gwen from
the Office of Foreign Missions,

34:56.591 --> 34:58.659
but her peers will think
it's a demotion, so...

34:58.660 --> 34:59.993
That.

34:59.994 --> 35:01.428
- Right there.
- What?

35:01.429 --> 35:02.629
That's what I've been looking for.

35:02.630 --> 35:03.797
Gwen.

35:03.798 --> 35:04.932
No, you.

35:04.933 --> 35:07.701
You don't have divided loyalties.

35:07.702 --> 35:09.770
You won't feel like you've been demoted,

35:09.771 --> 35:12.272
and I do not have to wonder

35:12.273 --> 35:15.175
about whether or not
you'll crack under pressure.

35:15.176 --> 35:16.400
Uh, he's already been kidnapped.

35:16.401 --> 35:18.011
You've already been kidnapped.

35:18.012 --> 35:20.013
And you didn't quit.

35:20.014 --> 35:23.283
Uh... that right there, I mean,
you're either totally nuts,

35:23.284 --> 35:27.054
or the most loyal
person I will ever find.

35:27.055 --> 35:30.090
I'm not trying to talk
myself into a job here.

35:30.091 --> 35:32.192
Right there. Another
reason you're so perfect.

35:32.193 --> 35:33.493
Then I'd be honored

35:33.494 --> 35:34.962
to be considered.

35:34.963 --> 35:37.030
There's no consideration.
You are it, pal.

35:37.031 --> 35:38.999
Just hang on, okay?

35:39.000 --> 35:40.233
I'm...

35:40.234 --> 35:41.601
It... Uh...

35:41.602 --> 35:44.306
Chloe's little, and she
needs more of me, not less.

35:44.307 --> 35:45.979
- And I have to be there for Abby.
- Of course.

35:45.980 --> 35:48.118
No, really, like, I have
to leave by 6:00 on Tuesdays

35:48.119 --> 35:50.454
and Thursdays, like, out the door.

35:50.455 --> 35:51.855
We can make that work.

35:51.856 --> 35:53.223
And I can't always work on the weekends.

35:53.224 --> 35:54.224
Listen, are you forgetting?

35:54.225 --> 35:55.259
I raised three kids in this job.

35:55.260 --> 35:57.194
- I know all about it.
- With a spouse.

35:57.195 --> 35:59.996
And, due respect, ma'am,
my situation's different.

36:01.392 --> 36:05.201
Maybe I'm just not in the
right place in my life for this.

36:05.936 --> 36:07.938
We'll be fine.

36:07.939 --> 36:09.139
We'll delegate.

36:09.140 --> 36:10.199
Yeah?

36:10.200 --> 36:11.275
Do you want this job or not?

36:11.276 --> 36:12.476
Well, hell, yes I want it.

36:12.477 --> 36:14.311
- Oh, thank God.
- Let's go.

36:14.312 --> 36:17.647
Ah, just... right there, the whole time.

36:19.383 --> 36:21.285
Oh...

36:23.521 --> 36:27.925
You have no idea how
good you look right now.

36:27.926 --> 36:29.259
I might.

36:30.295 --> 36:33.931
Figured we had a weekend to make up for.

36:33.932 --> 36:35.532
I ruined that.

36:35.533 --> 36:39.002
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
gone after you about Alexander,

36:39.003 --> 36:41.337
- that...
- Oh, stop.

36:42.573 --> 36:46.777
Can I say again what a
fantastic father I think you are?

36:46.778 --> 36:47.978
For what it's worth,

36:47.979 --> 36:49.587
I'm taking Jace to the
Spy Museum tomorrow.

36:49.588 --> 36:50.848
Oh, good.

36:50.849 --> 36:52.516
We're still sort of dancing around

36:52.517 --> 36:54.451
his suspicions about my job.

36:54.452 --> 36:58.188
Uh, honestly, I'm... not quite
sure how to handle that one.

36:58.189 --> 37:01.125
Well, we're honest in
all the ways that count.

37:01.126 --> 37:04.128
And someday, his therapist
will be able to buy a boat.

37:05.997 --> 37:09.566
Here.

37:09.567 --> 37:11.135
What is that?

37:11.136 --> 37:13.170
Uh, it's a little something
I've been working on for a while.

37:13.171 --> 37:16.907
I was gonna pick it up in
Paris and give it to you there,

37:16.908 --> 37:19.443
but, uh, I found a colleague
who was flying back yesterday.

37:19.444 --> 37:21.278
He grabbed it for me.

37:21.279 --> 37:22.713
How did you get my father's watch?

37:22.714 --> 37:24.081
It was lost in the car accident.

37:24.082 --> 37:25.482
It's a recreation.

37:25.483 --> 37:28.418
I found the guy who made the original.

37:28.419 --> 37:29.453
He's in his 90s.

37:29.454 --> 37:30.721
He's still at it.

37:30.722 --> 37:33.624
Here.

37:33.625 --> 37:35.359
But how, I mean... wait...

37:35.360 --> 37:37.294
You always talked about it

37:37.295 --> 37:39.329
and pointed it out in photographs

37:39.330 --> 37:42.132
and told me he bought
it on his honeymoon.

37:42.133 --> 37:45.268
It wasn't that hard to figure out.

37:46.003 --> 37:48.672
I love this watch.

37:48.673 --> 37:50.007
Well, here's a promise.

37:50.008 --> 37:54.243
I'll always find time
for you and the kids.

37:54.978 --> 37:57.680
Thank you.

38:03.554 --> 38:05.355
- Is that Russell Jackson?
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

38:05.356 --> 38:08.025
- Mm-mm.
- Ugh. It is. He's here.

38:10.028 --> 38:12.862
Hold that thought.

38:13.897 --> 38:15.699
Russell.

38:15.700 --> 38:17.568
What an unexpected surprise.

38:17.569 --> 38:19.837
Thought I'd share the
good news in person.

38:19.838 --> 38:22.940
Senator Morejon just agreed to
the terms of our original offer

38:22.941 --> 38:24.608
on the budget amendments.

38:24.609 --> 38:26.610
Both houses are expected to sign off

38:26.611 --> 38:28.779
on the new CR in the morning.

38:28.780 --> 38:30.981
That is felicitous.

38:30.982 --> 38:32.482
It is.

38:32.483 --> 38:34.084
Just when I'm hours away

38:34.085 --> 38:36.653
from eliminating the number
one threat to our agenda,

38:36.654 --> 38:40.257
the guy caves out of nowhere.

38:40.258 --> 38:42.392
He was probably persuaded by the threat

38:42.393 --> 38:44.795
of a pandemic, or...

38:44.796 --> 38:47.264
...getting blamed for one.

38:47.265 --> 38:48.632
Speaking of,

38:48.633 --> 38:50.200
I should probably call my Africa desk.

38:50.201 --> 38:52.302
- Gonna be a busy morning.
- Stay in your lane,

38:52.303 --> 38:54.271
Bess.

38:54.272 --> 38:55.739
Understood?

38:55.740 --> 38:58.175
You asked me to help end the shutdown.

38:58.176 --> 39:01.577
So what I think you mean is "thank you."

39:02.846 --> 39:04.748
Glass of wine, Russell?

39:06.384 --> 39:08.367
- I got to get home.
- Okay.

39:08.368 --> 39:11.080
Uh, where are you on
the new chief of staff?

39:11.081 --> 39:14.250
- I sent over a good guy.
- Oh. Yeah, you did.

39:14.251 --> 39:16.753
Uh, but I'm gonna go with Jay.

39:16.754 --> 39:19.051
Who in the hell is Jay?

39:19.700 --> 39:21.050
Whitman.

39:22.509 --> 39:25.543
My policy advisor.

39:28.147 --> 39:29.515
Well, that's dumb.

39:29.516 --> 39:31.082
Good night, Russell.

39:36.983 --> 39:38.578
You have your passport, right?

39:38.579 --> 39:40.592
Okay. Twice is helpful.

39:40.593 --> 39:42.331
Three times, a bit excessive.

39:43.329 --> 39:46.732
Why is Russell Jackson
telling me to bring donuts?

39:46.733 --> 39:48.866
What?

39:50.502 --> 39:52.371
If you're calling to
warn me about donuts,

39:52.372 --> 39:54.073
that's my wife's job.

39:54.074 --> 39:56.875
I'm sorry. Is the shutdown over?

39:56.876 --> 39:58.710
Your mother didn't mention this?

39:58.711 --> 39:59.945
I haven't seen her.

39:59.946 --> 40:03.182
Also, I'm supposed to
be leaving for England

40:03.183 --> 40:04.183
in three hours.

40:04.184 --> 40:05.618
Well, I guess this means no donuts.

40:05.619 --> 40:08.153
I can come in if you need me.

40:08.154 --> 40:10.622
How long are you gonna be gone?

40:10.623 --> 40:12.057
A week.

40:12.058 --> 40:14.226
Well, I suppose we can survive.

40:14.227 --> 40:16.562
It's up to you.

40:16.563 --> 40:21.200
Okay. Uh, I guess I'll
see you in a week, then.

40:21.201 --> 40:22.501
Thanks. Bye.

40:22.502 --> 40:23.635
Thank God.

40:23.636 --> 40:24.736
Okay, right.

40:24.737 --> 40:26.904
I think this is everything.

40:27.906 --> 40:29.374
You ready?

40:29.375 --> 40:33.178
I don't know. Um...

40:33.179 --> 40:35.013
I kind of feel like I should go in.

40:35.014 --> 40:36.682
Why? What did he say?

40:36.683 --> 40:37.850
He said it's up to me.

40:37.851 --> 40:40.051
And you're going to
choose to go to work.

40:42.087 --> 40:45.257
I'm just not sure I really
want to go on this trip.

40:45.258 --> 40:46.959
I'm sorry. What?

40:46.960 --> 40:49.027
Wh... You're telling me this now? We...

40:49.028 --> 40:51.730
Uh, it's just hitting me.

40:51.731 --> 40:53.174
Well, you did agree to it.

40:53.175 --> 40:55.701
- That kind of implies consent.
- I know. I'm sorry.

40:55.702 --> 40:57.402
Is this about my family?

40:57.403 --> 40:58.670
Can I reassure you

40:58.671 --> 41:00.339
on the way, because we
really do have to go.

41:00.340 --> 41:01.907
Jareth, I feel terrible, okay?

41:01.908 --> 41:03.542
I mean, especially 'cause
you've given up so much

41:03.543 --> 41:05.811
- just to be with me.
- Okay, wait. What are you saying?

41:05.812 --> 41:10.182
I'm saying... that...

41:10.183 --> 41:13.252
I never listen to the
voice in my head, you know?

41:13.253 --> 41:16.188
I... Anytime I've done
something I don't want to do,

41:16.189 --> 41:17.789
there's always a voice telling me

41:17.790 --> 41:19.992
"Don't do it. Don't
join the lacrosse team

41:19.993 --> 41:21.727
"because you want
Gina Marek to like you.

41:21.728 --> 41:23.362
"Don't quit college
because you're freaked out

41:23.363 --> 41:24.696
- about your mom"
- Okay, no, no, no.

41:24.697 --> 41:25.898
This is just the voice of fear.

41:25.899 --> 41:27.799
- No. I don't think it is.
- It is.

41:27.800 --> 41:29.568
And you don't have to be afraid,

41:29.569 --> 41:32.571
because we're together.

41:32.572 --> 41:35.136
Are we? I mean, are we?

41:35.137 --> 41:37.110
Well, this is what this
trip is meant to be about.

41:37.111 --> 41:39.278
I just... I think I need to
think things through a little bit.

41:39.279 --> 41:40.646
Oh, my God. I can't
believe this is happening.

41:40.647 --> 41:41.847
I'm not saying anything definitive.

41:41.848 --> 41:44.682
Okay? I just... I need
a little bit of time.

41:47.920 --> 41:50.289
Sure.

41:50.290 --> 41:52.323
Jareth...

41:55.929 --> 41:58.864
I'll see you in a week, okay?

41:58.865 --> 42:01.934
We'll talk.

42:01.935 --> 42:04.303
I just wish that the voice in your head

42:04.304 --> 42:08.106
was telling you to go with me.
