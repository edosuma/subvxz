00:02.080 --> 00:03.081
Why are we here?

00:03.160 --> 00:06.164
Someone outside the Family
is carrying Royal blood.

00:06.240 --> 00:09.005
What do you suppose a Royal
offspring would be worth?

00:09.080 --> 00:11.162
You're in my way.
I said, "You're in my..."

Why didn't you tell me?

JULIETTE: You didn't know
what you were doing.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.650
You weren't yourself.
NICK: That doesn't matter.

00:17.720 --> 00:19.563
If I killed somebody,
I have to turn myself in.

00:19.640 --> 00:21.404
Now, you wanna turn
yourself in, go ahead.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.642
But you're going to do it alone.

00:23.760 --> 00:25.762
Nick! Nick!

00:25.840 --> 00:27.604
NICK: I feel fine.
You didn't look fine.

00:27.680 --> 00:29.205
I'm serious.
You're seeing a doctor.

Nick, I'm gonna
increase the speed,

your heart rate up.

01:05.960 --> 01:07.246
How do you feel?

01:10.320 --> 01:11.880
Just gonna increase
the speed some more.

01:12.120 --> 01:13.849
Really would like to
get that heart rate up.

01:30.360 --> 01:32.169
DOCTOR: No matter how fast
I had you running,

01:33.000 --> 01:35.844
your heart rate and your
blood pressure hardly moved.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.002
Okay. Either the
machine is broken,

01:38.240 --> 01:40.322
or you are in incredible shape.

01:40.440 --> 01:42.283
Either way, until we know
if it's working properly,

01:42.360 --> 01:44.360
I don't know that we can
count on the test results.

01:44.640 --> 01:45.687
Was there a problem?

01:45.800 --> 01:47.040
I don't think so.

01:47.680 --> 01:51.048
From the looks of it, if there's
an error, it's in your favor,

01:51.120 --> 01:52.804
but has there been
any change to your

01:52.880 --> 01:55.565

02:37.360 --> 02:39.124

02:40.400 --> 02:43.324
that Nick's back with Juliette,

02:43.400 --> 02:47.166
and you're still renting your
brother's old apartment,

02:47.240 --> 02:50.528
which is a great apartment.

Anyway, my house has
a lot of closet space.

03:34.880 --> 03:36.120
Yes.

03:37.720 --> 03:40.485
Which means that I
think you could totally

03:41.120 --> 03:45.125
have more room in my closets

03:45.240 --> 03:47.163
than in your apartment.

03:49.480 --> 03:53.326

about moving in together.

that I thought you were dead,

I could barely feel it.

06:16.200 --> 06:17.486
So what does that mean?

I think it means that whatever you
ingested is still affecting you.

explain that to the doctor?

killed plenty of them.

14:01.720 --> 14:03.404
That's what you
Grimms do, isn't it?

14:04.720 --> 14:07.371
Now, excuse me. I've got a
meeting with the mayor.

14:11.960 --> 14:13.803
When you have an answer,
let me know.

14:26.960 --> 14:28.610
What'd I tell you about
getting too comfortable?

14:28.800 --> 14:31.451
I'm not. Good. We got
another tree hugger.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.406
WU: This time it's female.

14:36.520 --> 14:39.205
We found her car abandoned
up on a curb down the way.

14:39.280 --> 14:41.408
Door was open, purse was inside.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.448
That's her driver's license.

14:43.920 --> 14:45.126
Stephanie Robinson.

14:45.200 --> 14:46.201
This is her work ID.

14:46.320 --> 14:49.802
She's a sales rep for Wilkes
Medical Supplies out of Seattle.

14:49.920 --> 14:51.331
We're pretty sure that's her.

14:52.320 --> 14:53.685
Same MO.

14:54.160 --> 14:55.810
We got ourselves
a serial killer here?

14:55.880 --> 14:57.723
A completely different
kind of victim.

14:58.120 --> 15:00.168
So what's the connection
between the two?

15:00.920 --> 15:02.331
Besides the tree?

15:03.040 --> 15:04.485
Anybody see her climb up there?

15:04.640 --> 15:07.883
Uh, even if they did, it's not
that unusual in Portland.

15:08.600 --> 15:09.600
Where's the car?

15:09.640 --> 15:10.801
This way.

15:12.200 --> 15:13.406
Purse is on the front seat.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.209
That's where I got
her license and work ID.

15:15.280 --> 15:18.011
Other than that,
that's how I found it.

15:23.600 --> 15:25.011
Got some receipts here.

15:27.200 --> 15:29.965
One from the Apple Store
yesterday, another from Target.

15:30.040 --> 15:31.849
Two days ago, she went to a spa.

15:32.280 --> 15:34.123
The night before last, looks
like she went to dinner

15:34.200 --> 15:35.690
at Raven & Rose.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.124
Raven & Rose? Oh.

15:38.360 --> 15:40.806
Love that place.
Chef Ostler? Genius.

15:40.880 --> 15:43.720
Which is why you can't get a reservation
unless you want to eat at 5:00.

15:45.080 --> 15:46.320
Off topic.

15:46.920 --> 15:48.126
Parking receipt.

15:48.200 --> 15:49.361
Wait a minute.

15:49.680 --> 15:52.331
Didn't Klosterman and his wife
have dinner for their anniversary?

15:53.240 --> 15:55.288
Yeah, but we didn't get the
name of the restaurant.

15:55.360 --> 15:56.407
Maybe the victims
knew each other.

15:56.480 --> 15:58.801
Well, they couldn't have gone together.
This is dated from last night.

15:58.880 --> 15:59.927
But still,
they died the same way.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.080
There might be a connection.

16:01.120 --> 16:02.485
We should call
Mrs. Klosterman.

16:10.040 --> 16:11.485
Mrs. Klosterman,
sorry to bother you.

16:11.560 --> 16:12.800
This is Detective Griffin.

16:13.360 --> 16:14.771
I just have a quick question.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.561
You went out to dinner with your
husband for your anniversary.

16:17.640 --> 16:19.768
What was the name
of the restaurant?

16:22.040 --> 16:24.168
Raven & Rose.
Thank you very much.

16:24.240 --> 16:26.368
That's all I needed.
Please do take care.

16:48.080 --> 16:50.765
Without a connection between the
victims or someone at the restaurant,

16:50.840 --> 16:52.251
we have no motive.

16:52.480 --> 16:53.811
We may not even have a murder.

16:53.880 --> 16:56.201
All we have is two
people who ate there,

16:56.280 --> 16:58.851
climbed trees, and blew up.

16:58.960 --> 17:00.644

look at their menu.

RENARD: (OVER PHONE)
Have you found Frau Pech?

17:40.560 --> 17:41.607
No.

17:42.640 --> 17:45.246
I haven't been able to find
her anywhere in Vienna.

17:45.600 --> 17:48.444
I'm in her home.
She's not here either.

17:48.600 --> 17:51.649
She could have left Austria, trying
to make a deal for the child.

17:52.960 --> 17:54.928
There'll be buyers all
over the world for that.

17:55.120 --> 17:57.441
SEBASTIEN: Frau Pech might
not have left at all.

17:58.480 --> 18:00.164
I have some notes of hers.

18:00.640 --> 18:03.689
There's one that says, "Sachem"

18:04.160 --> 18:07.687
which I assume is the hotel,

18:07.960 --> 18:12.648
and then "215," which is
probably a room number.

18:12.720 --> 18:17.089
I'm thinking it might be the
buyer, or she's making a deal.

18:17.600 --> 18:19.602
Find out who's in that room.

18:30.320 --> 18:32.721
I'm sorry, we don't open
for another half hour.

18:34.360 --> 18:35.361
Oh.

18:37.080 --> 18:38.764
We need to talk
to Graydon Ostler.

18:38.840 --> 18:40.524
Oh!
No, you don't understand.

18:40.640 --> 18:42.369

before we serve dinner, so...

OSTLER: No, no, no!
Get away from the stove!

18:45.080 --> 18:47.606
You're turning my sauce into cheese!

you the meaning of cuisine?

OSTLER: Get back to
your stations, now!

19:12.560 --> 19:14.289
What?
Wesen.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.161
What kind?

19:16.240 --> 19:17.287
Bauerschwein.

19:17.360 --> 19:18.600
Ostler?

19:18.680 --> 19:19.920
All of them.

19:25.120 --> 19:26.610
You say they
dined here recently?

19:26.680 --> 19:28.409
Yes, within
the last couple of days.

19:29.320 --> 19:30.845
Sorry, I don't
recognize either one.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.445
What is this about?

19:32.600 --> 19:34.284
Well, they both died.
What?

19:35.360 --> 19:38.040
You don't think this had something
to do with my restaurant, do you?

19:38.160 --> 19:40.401
Look, we had the county health
inspector here last month,

19:40.480 --> 19:43.211
and he gave us perfect scores.
Plus, look at my menu.

19:43.280 --> 19:46.124
We specifically ask if you
have any food allergies,

19:46.200 --> 19:47.531
and we warn against ingredients

19:47.600 --> 19:49.568
such as raw eggs
and shellfish. No.

19:49.640 --> 19:52.484
We need to know if anybody who
works for you knew the victims.

19:52.560 --> 19:53.925
We need a list
of your employees,

19:54.120 --> 19:56.282
and we need to know
what Stephanie Robinson

19:56.360 --> 19:58.283
and Ned Klosterman ordered.

19:59.560 --> 20:00.971
That shouldn't be a problem.

20:01.040 --> 20:03.088
Neither of the victims
ordered the same thing.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.050
Klosterman had osso buco,

20:05.120 --> 20:07.646
Robinson had halibut
with huckleberry sauce.

20:07.800 --> 20:09.211
They both ordered wine.

20:09.320 --> 20:12.290
He had Pinot Noir,
she had Sauvignon Blanc.

20:12.920 --> 20:16.606
No one on this list has a criminal
record, including the chef.

20:17.040 --> 20:19.725
And Klosterman's wife didn't
recognize any of these names.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.721
Got the tox screens
back on your vics.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.246
Well, I assume you've read them?

20:24.320 --> 20:25.731
Of course.
Then just tell us.

20:25.960 --> 20:27.007
No known pathogens.

20:27.120 --> 20:30.283
No known poisons or toxins.
You got nothing.

20:33.200 --> 20:35.646
Yeah, nothing except a kitchen
full of Bauerschwein.

20:35.760 --> 20:37.171
We can't arrest them for that.

20:37.640 --> 20:38.641
(SCOFFS)

20:39.160 --> 20:40.924
it kind of sounds
like an extreme form

20:41.000 --> 20:42.809
of gastric dilatation volvulus.

20:42.880 --> 20:44.120
Excuse me?

20:44.840 --> 20:46.126
Bloat.

20:46.320 --> 20:48.084
Dogs get it, cattle get it.

20:48.160 --> 20:51.084
It's breed-specific, so for
dogs it would be, you know,

20:51.160 --> 20:53.527
Irish Setters,
Great Danes, St. Bernards.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.443
What about the volvulus part?

20:55.520 --> 20:57.090
That's when
the stomach gets twisted

20:57.160 --> 20:59.925
around the longitudinal
axis of the digestive tract.

21:00.440 --> 21:01.960
I should ask you
this stuff more often.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.525
Now, you said it
was breed-specific?

21:04.320 --> 21:06.243
So I'm wondering if
the victims in this case

21:06.320 --> 21:08.641
might somehow be the same breed.

21:09.440 --> 21:11.807
The kitchen staff was
entirely Bauerschwein.

21:11.880 --> 21:13.803
Well, were
the victims Bauerschwein?

21:13.880 --> 21:15.689
I don't know, and now
that they're dead,

21:15.840 --> 21:19.526
there's no way to find out,
but if they were Blutbaden...

21:20.880 --> 21:21.881
What?

21:22.400 --> 21:23.970
You see, Blutbaden
and Bauerschwein

21:24.040 --> 21:25.451
have been feuding for centuries.

21:27.160 --> 21:28.730
No, but this is a restaurant.

21:28.880 --> 21:30.120
Anybody can eat there.

21:30.200 --> 21:31.611
Plus, how would they know
they were Blutbaden

21:31.680 --> 21:33.250
or what they were ordering?

21:33.440 --> 21:36.046
Well, why don't you think about
that on your way to Monroe's?

21:36.360 --> 21:39.364
Aren't you supposed to be
moving out tonight?

21:39.840 --> 21:42.047
Or have you changed
your mind on me?

21:42.560 --> 21:44.881
No. I'm on my way.

21:45.120 --> 21:46.121
I'll see you soon.

21:46.240 --> 21:49.164
And thank you
for the bloat info.

21:49.480 --> 21:50.720
Anytime.

21:51.160 --> 21:53.128
It's gonna be weird
not having you around.

21:53.240 --> 21:55.163
Sure, it's gonna be great
having my house back,

21:55.240 --> 21:56.960
and I did kind of like
The Odd Couple thing.

21:57.840 --> 21:59.440
Except, of course,
when Rosalee was here.

21:59.520 --> 22:00.646
Yeah.

22:01.600 --> 22:03.364
Well, I can't tell you how
much you helped me out

22:03.440 --> 22:04.646
by letting me stay here.

22:05.080 --> 22:09.210
You know what? That whole "Juliette
in a coma and not remembering you

22:09.280 --> 22:13.171
"and then kind of hating
you" thing, just a bad deal.

22:13.640 --> 22:15.005
I'm sorry,
I don't mean to rehash.

22:15.080 --> 22:16.400
It's just,
I'm glad it worked out,

22:16.840 --> 22:17.966
for both of us.

22:18.080 --> 22:19.525
I know it wasn't always easy.

22:20.280 --> 22:22.248
Well, hey, how many Blutbaden

22:22.360 --> 22:24.800
can say they had a Grimm living
with them under the same roof?

22:25.440 --> 22:26.520
And lived to tell about it?

22:26.560 --> 22:27.925
Right, probably...

22:28.280 --> 22:29.805
None.
None, actually.

22:30.280 --> 22:31.930
I mean...

22:32.920 --> 22:34.046
Yeah.

22:35.840 --> 22:37.444
Uh, toothbrush.
Right.

22:40.000 --> 22:44.289
Oh, hey, have you heard about this
new restaurant, Raven & Rose?

22:44.600 --> 22:47.001
Heard about it? Rosalee and I
just ate there the other night.

22:47.080 --> 22:48.206
It is spectacular!

22:48.280 --> 22:50.726
I had an incredible
vegan sausage cassoulet...

22:50.800 --> 22:52.962
You know it's run by
Bauerschwein, right?

22:53.280 --> 22:55.647
No, but why should that matter?

22:55.720 --> 22:57.245
Lots of Wesen own restaurants.

22:57.400 --> 23:00.165
I mean, I would never frequent a
place run by a Schneetmacher,

23:00.240 --> 23:02.527
or for that matter,
that served Schneetmacher.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.161
But...

23:05.240 --> 23:06.366
You feeling okay?

23:06.800 --> 23:08.928
Oh, man. I feel great.

23:10.920 --> 23:14.208
Well, I think this
just about does it.

23:15.200 --> 23:16.326

Yeah, I am,

23:26.640 --> 23:28.130
Hey, could you
get the door for me?

23:28.200 --> 23:31.170

It's not my birthday.

23:39.480 --> 23:41.130
It's for your leaving.
ROSALEE: Oh, yes.

23:41.200 --> 23:43.168
And we're pretty
excited about it.

23:43.240 --> 23:44.730
So my wife baked a cake!

23:44.800 --> 23:47.041
She doesn't need
much of an excuse.

23:47.560 --> 23:49.642
ROSALEE: Bud, this cake
is so gorgeous.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.324
Where's your wife?
BUD: With the kids.

23:51.400 --> 23:52.560
Somebody's got to watch them.

23:52.600 --> 23:54.648
God knows what they'll chew
up when you're not home.

23:55.280 --> 23:56.281
All right, now,

23:56.360 --> 23:59.762
I just want to say, for a
roommate who's a Grimm...

23:59.880 --> 24:01.962
And I really mean this...
(TELEPHONE RINGS)

24:02.520 --> 24:04.090
I'll get it.

24:05.680 --> 24:06.727

24:06.840 --> 24:08.365
You were about to
tell me how great I am.

24:08.440 --> 24:11.250
Actually, I was about to say how
great I was for putting up with you,

24:11.320 --> 24:12.845
but yeah, you were okay, too.

24:12.920 --> 24:14.251
Uh, can we get to
the drinking part?

24:14.320 --> 24:15.320
Yeah, let's do this.
Yeah!

24:15.360 --> 24:16.361
Cheers.
That's what I say.

Kimber's on the phone.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.451
Something's happened to Sam.

24:19.560 --> 24:21.562
She's calling
everyone looking for him.

24:21.800 --> 24:23.006
What?

24:25.720 --> 24:26.881
Hey.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.648
Who's Sam?
He's a friend of Monroe's.

24:29.720 --> 24:31.370
I just met him at a
restaurant the other night.

24:31.440 --> 24:32.441
What happened to him?

24:32.520 --> 24:34.648
He hasn't come home, and he's
not answering his phone,

24:34.720 --> 24:36.609
so she's very concerned.
MONROE: Take care.

24:38.080 --> 24:39.605
MONROE: Okay, this is weird.

24:39.800 --> 24:42.201
Kimber says Sam
snapped this morning,

24:42.280 --> 24:44.009
that he woke up and his
eyes were kind of glassy.

24:44.080 --> 24:46.003
He didn't feel well,
but he went to work anyway,

24:46.080 --> 24:47.366
and now she can't find him.

24:47.440 --> 24:48.965
And this is not like Sam.

24:49.480 --> 24:51.403
Did he eat at Raven & Rose?

24:51.600 --> 24:54.251
Yeah, that's actually
where we ran into him.

24:54.320 --> 24:56.368
I love that place. A little
pricey but worth it.

24:56.440 --> 24:57.885
All right, is he a Blutbad?

24:58.080 --> 25:00.765
Sam? Yeah, why?

25:00.960 --> 25:02.960
We're working on a case.
We've got two dead bodies,

25:03.000 --> 25:05.606
and both of them ate at the Raven
& Rose in the last few days.

25:05.760 --> 25:08.923
All right, do you know Ned
Klosterman or Stephanie Robinson?

25:09.040 --> 25:10.849
Ned, I do, yeah. Why?

25:11.120 --> 25:12.645
They were the two victims.

25:14.440 --> 25:15.680
Is Ned a Blutbad?

25:15.760 --> 25:16.761
Yeah, yeah.

25:16.840 --> 25:19.764
He's one of my old hunting
buddies, you know, from...

25:21.200 --> 25:22.725

25:25.800 --> 25:27.290
I don't know.
I don't know her.

25:27.360 --> 25:29.522
But at least two of
the three were Blutbaden.

25:29.600 --> 25:31.125
Monroe, we're gonna need
Sam's license plate.

25:31.200 --> 25:33.000

an APB out on his car.

Uh, right. Okay.

25:36.080 --> 25:37.127

25:37.200 --> 25:39.806
The restaurant is
run by Bauerschwein.

25:40.320 --> 25:43.324
And we think that they're
somehow targeting Blutbaden.

25:43.400 --> 25:45.129
Oh, God! Oh, God!
This is really bad.

25:45.640 --> 25:47.529

going after Blutbaden?

What did he eat?

25:58.240 --> 25:59.241
Uh...

I mean, should I not?

26:08.200 --> 26:09.486
How did they die?

26:09.880 --> 26:12.884
It's something similar to
gastric dilatation volvulus.

at Raven & Rose.

been in anything.

All of Vienna is in mourning.

36:15.520 --> 36:17.488
Yes?
Room service.

36:17.760 --> 36:18.966
For me?

36:19.360 --> 36:21.124
Room 215?
Yes.

36:21.760 --> 36:23.569
But I didn't order
any room service.

36:23.840 --> 36:25.126
There must be some mistake.

36:49.280 --> 36:50.281
Magnifique.

37:17.040 --> 37:18.565
(GROWLING)

37:56.080 --> 37:58.526
That's it. Run, run, run.

38:04.560 --> 38:05.561
(GROWLS)

38:13.920 --> 38:18.209
Oh. So what shall we
serve the Blutbad tonight?

38:20.720 --> 38:21.721
Wait a minute.

38:21.880 --> 38:24.042
How about the chef himself?

38:24.560 --> 38:26.289
I haven't done anything.
Stay away!

38:26.400 --> 38:27.401
Oh-ho!

38:28.080 --> 38:30.606
I like it when
dinner talks back.

38:30.920 --> 38:31.921
(GROWLS)

38:33.560 --> 38:34.891
No! No, no, please!

38:42.760 --> 38:43.921
Get back!

38:48.600 --> 38:49.601
(MONROE GROWLING)

39:04.840 --> 39:06.080
You're under arrest.

39:08.560 --> 39:10.085
OSTLER: You've got
to protect me.

39:11.920 --> 39:13.684
He killed my friends!

39:14.120 --> 39:16.407
Get down on the ground. Put
your hands behind your head!

39:16.480 --> 39:18.847
Not until we kill
every last one of them.

39:18.960 --> 39:21.645
BLUTBAD: All Bauerschwein
must die!

39:22.080 --> 39:23.080
Don't do this.

39:23.120 --> 39:25.043
OSTLER: Don't let
him get me.

39:30.880 --> 39:31.881
Don't!
No!

39:33.640 --> 39:34.641
(GROANS)

39:40.440 --> 39:41.646
(BLUTBADEN HOWLING)

39:50.480 --> 39:52.528
You killed him!
Thank God!

39:53.320 --> 39:54.810
He didn't give me a choice.

39:59.600 --> 40:01.011
Oh, my God.

40:04.600 --> 40:05.840
You shot him.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.923
BLUTBAD: Kill him now.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.810
BLUTBAD 2: Yeah, we'll shut
down his place for good!

40:15.360 --> 40:16.407
They're everywhere.

40:16.760 --> 40:17.921
BLUTBAD: Bauerschwein!

40:18.080 --> 40:19.809
Now this feud ends,

40:20.160 --> 40:21.161
and it ends now.

40:22.320 --> 40:23.606
You have to get me out of here.

40:24.600 --> 40:26.921
Not until you
confess to murdering

40:27.000 --> 40:29.287
Klosterman, Robinson and Leoni.

40:29.800 --> 40:32.849
If you don't, these Blutbaden are gonna
kill every Bauerschwein you know.

40:35.120 --> 40:36.121
(GROWLS)

40:36.360 --> 40:37.600
BLUTBAD: Kill the hog!

40:37.680 --> 40:41.207
There's nothing you
can do to stop us.

40:43.360 --> 40:44.361
(BLUTBADEN HOWLING)

40:46.120 --> 40:47.121
(BLUTBADEN GROWLING)

40:47.200 --> 40:49.202
BLUTBAD: Guess who's
on the menu tonight.

40:49.640 --> 40:51.927
Oh, man.
There's a lot of them.

40:52.720 --> 40:54.404
We have to start thinking
about ourselves here, Nick.

40:54.480 --> 40:57.006
What? No,
you can't leave me!

40:57.720 --> 40:59.051
Unless you confess...

40:59.480 --> 41:01.289
We gotta let
nature take its course.

41:01.400 --> 41:02.481
Let's go, huh?

41:02.560 --> 41:04.562
BLUTBAD: Time to die, pig!

41:05.840 --> 41:07.080
(GROWLS)
(BLUTBAD LAUGHS)

41:07.360 --> 41:09.010
You're trapped, Dig!

41:14.280 --> 41:15.884
Okay, okay, okay!
I did it! I confess!

41:15.960 --> 41:17.291
I did it! I killed them!

41:17.360 --> 41:18.725
All right,
just get me out of here!

41:47.400 --> 41:48.640
You really think
me admitting this

41:48.720 --> 41:51.963
is gonna stop something that's
been going on for centuries?

41:52.280 --> 41:53.361
No.

41:54.040 --> 41:55.690
But it's a start.

42:06.760 --> 42:09.047
You know, you connected
on a couple of those.

42:09.360 --> 42:10.885
Yeah, you, too.

42:11.240 --> 42:12.241
(SCOFFS)

42:12.720 --> 42:13.767
He signed it.

42:14.080 --> 42:15.411
He did.

42:15.760 --> 42:18.650
And this little
piggy went to jail.
