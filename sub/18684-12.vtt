00:11.259 --> 00:13.726
Don't worry, I have you.

00:13.751 --> 00:15.484
Just one step at a time.

00:17.755 --> 00:19.721
Where are you taking me?

00:19.723 --> 00:20.923
You'll see.

00:25.496 --> 00:26.929
When do I take it off?

00:26.931 --> 00:28.163
Wait, wait.

00:31.368 --> 00:32.668
Stay.

00:32.670 --> 00:34.369
One moment. Okay.

00:48.752 --> 00:53.422
Look, you... my ridiculous,
romantic husband.

00:53.424 --> 00:55.290
I love you! Ah, ah, ah, ah.

00:55.292 --> 00:56.325
That's not the present.

00:56.327 --> 00:57.993
That's to celebrate the present.

00:57.995 --> 00:59.928
What do you mean?

00:59.930 --> 01:01.664
This place.

01:01.932 --> 01:03.065
It's yours.

01:06.937 --> 01:07.736
How?

01:07.738 --> 01:09.104
It's like we talked about.

01:09.106 --> 01:10.272
It's... It's not much now,

01:10.274 --> 01:12.207
but it's what you'll make of it.

01:13.644 --> 01:15.611
The place you've always dreamed of.

01:15.613 --> 01:17.713
This is what the money was for?

01:17.715 --> 01:20.682
Will that do for an anniversary
present, Mrs. Bonnar?

01:34.698 --> 01:35.898
Christian Bonnar.

01:35.900 --> 01:38.233
Mr. Bonnar, can you come to the school?

01:38.235 --> 01:39.735
It's about Sofia.

02:01.258 --> 02:03.158
I've just got a fever and my stomach.

02:03.160 --> 02:04.493
I just want to lie down.

02:04.495 --> 02:06.133
We should take her to a doctor.

02:06.158 --> 02:07.314
I called Dr. De Luca.

02:07.339 --> 02:09.031
No, no, no, Dad, I really
don't want to see a doctor.

02:09.032 --> 02:11.300
He's at a house call.
He'll swing by after.

02:17.474 --> 02:19.441
Well, maybe you should just
go straight to bed, baby.

02:19.443 --> 02:20.842
Yeah, I'm just thirsty.

02:23.280 --> 02:24.313
Christian, did you open the...?

02:24.315 --> 02:25.514
Shut up!

02:27.084 --> 02:28.717
Whoa! Nobody move!

02:28.719 --> 02:30.219
Nobody will.

02:30.221 --> 02:31.853
Dad?

02:31.855 --> 02:33.689
It's okay, sweetheart. Stay calm.

02:35.059 --> 02:36.291
Take whatever you want.

02:36.293 --> 02:37.392
Where's the money?!

02:38.562 --> 02:40.362
I will kill her!

02:44.068 --> 02:45.834
When that guy tied
the hood over your head

02:45.836 --> 02:47.336
and drove you into the desert...

02:47.338 --> 02:49.438
how did you know you could trust them?

02:49.440 --> 02:50.939
The main guy's after-shave.

02:51.909 --> 02:53.542
High in denatured alcohol content...

02:53.544 --> 02:55.344
dipropylene, I suspect.

02:55.346 --> 02:56.612
Cheap stuff. Nasty.

02:56.614 --> 02:57.846
He really needed the money.

02:57.848 --> 02:58.981
How did you...?

03:01.619 --> 03:03.252
You're joking?

03:03.254 --> 03:04.620
Beaumont.

03:06.724 --> 03:08.523
Okay, Saunders can handle this one.

03:10.261 --> 03:11.493
How old is she?

03:12.896 --> 03:14.529
Got it.

03:14.531 --> 03:16.431
Pilot needs a new flight plan.

03:16.433 --> 03:18.667
What? Straight on to another job?

03:19.670 --> 03:21.303
Family's been kidnapped.

03:21.305 --> 03:24.339
One of them, a 14-year-old girl.

03:37.483 --> 03:45.612
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

03:56.708 --> 03:58.608
Any leads on the hostage taker?

03:58.610 --> 04:00.677
Refusing to identify himself.

04:00.679 --> 04:02.378
He's communicating through the husband.

04:02.380 --> 04:03.313
Demands?

04:03.315 --> 04:04.614
Waiting to talk to you.

04:04.616 --> 04:06.683
He expects a call in 10.

04:06.685 --> 04:08.685
Hello, by the way.

04:08.687 --> 04:09.919
Evie?

04:09.921 --> 04:11.955
She's with my mother in Paris.

04:11.957 --> 04:13.356
Okay, so we got nothing
on the kidnapper.

04:13.358 --> 04:14.757
What about the family?

04:14.759 --> 04:16.759
Your brief says Christian
Bonnar's been kidnapped before.

04:16.761 --> 04:18.595
Venezuela, three years ago.

04:18.596 --> 04:21.363
The authorities resolved the situation.

04:21.366 --> 04:22.732
His wife was killed.

04:22.734 --> 04:24.033
I take it that's why he doesn't want

04:24.035 --> 04:25.635
the police involved this time.

04:25.637 --> 04:28.138
Mr. Bonnar doesn't trust them.

04:28.140 --> 04:30.106
Kidnapped twice in three years.

04:30.108 --> 04:31.207
He's an unlucky guy.

04:31.209 --> 04:32.308
I do regard that

04:32.310 --> 04:33.476
as a point of interest.

04:33.478 --> 04:34.811
I suspected you might.

04:34.813 --> 04:36.546
Are you suggesting that he, uh,

04:36.548 --> 04:38.014
arranged his own kidnapping?

04:38.016 --> 04:40.550
Mr. Bonnar has lucrative
ransom insurance.

04:40.552 --> 04:42.986
Lightning can strike
twice in the same place,

04:42.988 --> 04:45.488
but... I don't trust coincidences.

04:45.490 --> 04:46.623
That's my girl.

04:46.625 --> 04:48.558
Was my girl.

04:50.462 --> 04:51.761
How's the job going?

04:51.763 --> 04:53.496
Uh, good. Uh...

04:53.498 --> 04:56.132
demanding, but inspiring.

04:56.134 --> 04:56.966
Do you mean Eric?

04:56.968 --> 04:58.334
I mean...

04:58.336 --> 05:00.503
Well, yeah, I guess.

05:00.505 --> 05:04.073
I agree... working with him is a joy.

05:04.075 --> 05:05.475
I'm right here, guys.

05:07.979 --> 05:11.447
Vincenzo Moretti,
president of Moretti Maritime.

05:11.449 --> 05:13.283
Eric Beaumont, negotiator.

05:13.285 --> 05:16.052
Zara Hallam, lead investigator.

05:16.054 --> 05:19.355
Thank you so much for coming over here.

05:19.357 --> 05:21.157
Christian and his family...

05:21.159 --> 05:23.059
they're my family, you understand?

05:23.061 --> 05:25.395
I do. Mr. Bonnar is your CEO?

05:25.397 --> 05:27.664
And joint owner. We were school friends.

05:27.666 --> 05:29.332
We built this business together.

05:29.334 --> 05:32.902
Are you aware of any financial
difficulties he may be having?

05:32.904 --> 05:35.438
Personal or professional?

05:36.954 --> 05:39.688
No. Christian has
no financial difficulties.

05:39.811 --> 05:41.444
And if you knew what it took him

05:41.446 --> 05:43.479
to recover from the trauma of last time,

05:43.481 --> 05:45.415
you would insinuate nothing.

05:45.417 --> 05:47.650
And who else knows
he has ransom insurance?

05:48.753 --> 05:50.153
All our employees, of course,

05:50.155 --> 05:51.688
but I'll tell you right now,
that none of them...

05:51.690 --> 05:53.990
Zara is direct because time
is of the essence.

05:53.992 --> 05:55.458
What were the circumstances

05:55.460 --> 05:57.860
of the previous kidnapping, sir?

05:57.862 --> 06:01.431
Christian and Janine,
his first wife, were in Caracas

06:01.433 --> 06:03.800
establishing an oil-shipping contract

06:03.802 --> 06:06.869
that led to considerable local tension.

06:06.871 --> 06:10.073
Christian blames the police's
impatience for Janine's death.

06:10.075 --> 06:11.608
It wasn't till he met Maria

06:11.610 --> 06:14.110
that he finally put
his tragedy behind him.

06:14.112 --> 06:17.513
And for it to happen
a second time? Come on...

06:19.484 --> 06:21.751
Mr. Moretti, one more question.

06:22.988 --> 06:25.121
Do you have a coffee machine?

06:25.123 --> 06:29.158
Okay. Live contact in 90 seconds.

06:29.160 --> 06:31.227
Tracking Christian's company cell.

06:35.100 --> 06:36.869
Static at the Bonnar house.

06:37.535 --> 06:39.168
Christian got hostage training

06:39.170 --> 06:41.064
as part of his ransom
insurance package, right?

06:41.077 --> 06:43.811
Yeah. Sit down, shut up,
and don't look 'em in the eye.

06:43.813 --> 06:45.046
If it helps him stay calm,

06:45.048 --> 06:46.447
it's good news for Christian
and his family.

06:46.449 --> 06:48.316
Where did we get with the bank records?

06:48.318 --> 06:49.817
Suspicion mounts.

06:49.819 --> 06:54.322
He withdrew a total
of 500,000 euro in cash

06:54.324 --> 06:57.558
from four separate bank
accounts three weeks ago.

06:57.560 --> 06:59.827
Who needs half-a-mill in cash?

07:00.663 --> 07:01.863
Kind of a red flag.

07:01.865 --> 07:04.232
If he's withdrawn it
from his own accounts,

07:04.234 --> 07:05.800
he's hardly trying to hide it.

07:05.802 --> 07:07.368
Oh, Eric, come on.

07:07.370 --> 07:09.871
He has zero history
of criminal activity.

07:09.873 --> 07:11.272
Ransom insurance,

07:11.274 --> 07:14.108
same man abducted twice,
large sums of cash.

07:14.110 --> 07:16.477
There must be something other
than a straightforward kidnap.

07:16.479 --> 07:18.746
Well, that I agree with, but
it takes a certain kind of man

07:18.748 --> 07:20.281
to deliberately subject his daughter

07:20.283 --> 07:21.549
to an ordeal like this.

07:21.551 --> 07:24.552
Mr. Bonnar does not fit that profile.

07:24.554 --> 07:26.154
So what is going on?

07:26.762 --> 07:27.822
Time.

07:27.824 --> 07:29.457
Mmm. Well, let's find out.

07:47.010 --> 07:48.709
Christian Bonnar.

07:48.711 --> 07:50.545
This is Eric Beaumont.

07:50.547 --> 07:52.947
I'm a negotiator hired
by your insurance company

07:52.949 --> 07:54.882
to make sure I get
your family out of there.

07:54.884 --> 07:57.819
I need to talk to the
person holding you hostage.

07:57.821 --> 07:59.353
He won't talk direct.

08:02.838 --> 08:04.125
So I understand.

08:04.127 --> 08:05.593
Christian, please tell him
that I need to talk

08:05.595 --> 08:07.595
to the man in charge of the situation.

08:09.899 --> 08:12.700
He needs to speak to the man
in charge of the situation.

08:17.574 --> 08:18.840
Who's this?

08:18.842 --> 08:21.309
I'm Eric, and I'm gonna
get you what you want

08:21.311 --> 08:24.011
so we can all go home
as quickly as possible.

08:24.013 --> 08:24.979
Good.

08:25.619 --> 08:26.781
What should I call you?

08:27.684 --> 08:30.618
No, no. No names.
Just 10 million... cash.

08:31.888 --> 08:34.155
I-It helps if I have a name

08:34.157 --> 08:35.356
so I can make sure

08:35.357 --> 08:37.991
that I'm talking to you and only to you.

08:39.796 --> 08:41.361
Okay, it's, um...

08:41.364 --> 08:42.535
It's Dede.

08:43.198 --> 08:44.409
Okay, Dede.

08:44.834 --> 08:45.933
Before moving forward,

08:45.935 --> 08:47.802
I need to make sure the family's safe.

08:48.120 --> 08:50.632
Could you please use the
video mode on the phone?

08:51.341 --> 08:53.141
Does your phone have video?

08:55.478 --> 08:56.344
I'll call you back.

08:56.346 --> 08:57.512
Mute the phone.

08:59.682 --> 09:01.883
How much is Mr. Bonnar insured for?

09:01.885 --> 09:03.551
Up to 15 million euros.

09:03.553 --> 09:06.254
But we're not ready to pay
anything close to that.

09:06.256 --> 09:08.856
And I was just gonna
go straight in at 15.

09:09.692 --> 09:11.159
You see?!

09:11.161 --> 09:13.327
You see they are all well!

09:16.199 --> 09:18.900
Thank you, Dede. I appreciate that.

09:18.902 --> 09:21.269
Now, 10 million... cash!

09:21.271 --> 09:23.471
Okay, so you're saying
you're willing to exchange

09:23.473 --> 09:26.307
the family for 10 million euros?

09:26.309 --> 09:27.575
Yeah, that's right.

09:27.577 --> 09:28.676
And if you don't get the 10 million,

09:28.678 --> 09:30.111
what will you do?

09:31.214 --> 09:32.246
I'll kill them.

09:35.251 --> 09:38.319
You'd shoot the man,
his wife, and the girl?

09:38.321 --> 09:40.521
That's what I said!
Just get me the money!

09:40.523 --> 09:42.290
Well, I want to,
but here's the thing, Dede.

09:43.205 --> 09:46.194
I will do whatever I can
to get you 10 mill...

09:46.196 --> 09:48.029
but it may take some days.

09:48.031 --> 09:50.264
No. No, no, no. I said today.

09:50.266 --> 09:52.066
Well, if getting it today is important,

09:52.068 --> 09:55.336
I can get you 750,000
euros in unmarked bills

09:55.338 --> 09:57.004
in just a matter of hours.

09:57.006 --> 09:59.373
750? Is that a joke?!

10:02.178 --> 10:04.011
If you're a man in a hurry,
I respect that,

10:04.013 --> 10:05.680
but I can only do what I can do.

10:05.682 --> 10:07.815
Heh, uh...

10:07.817 --> 10:10.518
Five. Five million.

10:10.520 --> 10:13.120
It's the same problem, Dede.

10:13.122 --> 10:16.691
No, okay, five million,
or I kill the girl!

10:16.693 --> 10:18.259
No, please don't!

10:19.696 --> 10:21.696
You're saying you would rather
shoot that innocent girl

10:21.698 --> 10:24.332
than have three-quarters of
a million euros in cash?

10:24.334 --> 10:25.900
Yes, that's what I said!

10:25.902 --> 10:28.636
I'll do it! I'll do it right now!

10:29.405 --> 10:32.573
Considerable agitation.

10:32.575 --> 10:34.008
Either a critical profile

10:34.010 --> 10:35.776
comfortable with extreme behaviors,

10:35.778 --> 10:38.279
or an amateur, way out of his depth.

10:38.281 --> 10:40.815
So we can't be certain
whether he'll shoot or not.

10:40.817 --> 10:42.650
Then have to assume he will.

10:42.652 --> 10:44.252
With a reaction like that,

10:44.254 --> 10:47.221
750 is below his baseline.

10:47.223 --> 10:48.122
Right?

10:48.124 --> 10:49.523
- What's going on?!
- Mm-hmm.

10:49.977 --> 10:51.325
What's the lowest he'll take?

10:52.095 --> 10:53.928
Excellent question, Ms. Carlson.

10:54.864 --> 10:56.697
You know what, Dede?
I'm with you on this.

10:56.699 --> 10:57.698
750 isn't enough.

10:57.700 --> 10:59.533
I just spoke to the insurance company

10:59.535 --> 11:01.802
and they've told me that you
can have another half-mill.

11:01.804 --> 11:04.939
That's 1.25 million euros.

11:05.275 --> 11:08.109
Two million. Two million, that's it!

11:08.111 --> 11:09.577
No more talk!

11:12.315 --> 11:14.181
I could probably get him down to one,

11:14.183 --> 11:15.583
but it's gonna take a few hours.

11:15.585 --> 11:17.355
She's 14... let's just
get her out of there.

11:18.087 --> 11:19.086
Close it.

11:19.088 --> 11:20.388
Dede, I'm personally gonna hand you

11:20.390 --> 11:22.556
two million euros in cash today.

11:22.558 --> 11:23.791
Do we have a deal?

11:27.297 --> 11:29.463
Yeah, okay. Deal.

11:35.071 --> 11:37.694
And that, friends...

11:38.074 --> 11:39.840
is how the magic happens.

11:44.747 --> 11:45.980
Who the hell is that?

11:45.982 --> 11:47.948
You tricked me! It's the police!

11:47.950 --> 11:49.016
You called the police!

11:49.018 --> 11:50.451
No, no, no, no!

11:50.453 --> 11:51.619
It's a doctor!

11:52.422 --> 11:53.654
Dede, we didn't have anything...

11:53.656 --> 11:55.156
No, no, listen!

11:55.158 --> 11:56.706
It's a doctor for my daughter!

12:00.129 --> 12:01.262
Ah!

12:01.264 --> 12:02.830
Please, he's a doctor! Don't hurt him!

12:02.832 --> 12:04.565
It's our company doctor, for Sofia!

12:04.567 --> 12:06.200
Information that would've
been useful before.

12:06.202 --> 12:07.468
Dede, he's a doctor.

12:07.470 --> 12:10.438
He's there for Sofia, the girl.
She's sick.

12:10.440 --> 12:12.640
Dede, we still have a deal.

12:12.642 --> 12:14.408
I'll decide that.

12:15.011 --> 12:15.943
- Yah!
- Ah!

12:20.980 --> 12:22.747
Shouldn't we re-establish contact?

12:22.749 --> 12:24.515
Mnh-mnh. He won't hurt the family.

12:24.517 --> 12:26.317
They're the only way
he's gonna get his money.

12:26.319 --> 12:27.985
He'll call us when he's ready.

12:27.987 --> 12:29.387
Well?

12:30.356 --> 12:32.123
The doctor's shaken up, but fine.

12:32.125 --> 12:33.657
Mr. Moretti asked him to hold off

12:33.659 --> 12:35.326
reporting this to the police.

12:35.328 --> 12:37.428
But Dede has taken the family somewhere.

12:37.430 --> 12:38.896
Description of Dede?

12:38.898 --> 12:41.198
Between 5'6 " and 5'8", late 20s,

12:41.200 --> 12:42.500
Middle Eastern appearance.

12:42.502 --> 12:44.935
Yeah, his accent sounded Egyptian.

12:44.937 --> 12:46.771
Huh. Profile?

12:46.773 --> 12:49.039
He presents strong, but voice patterns

12:49.041 --> 12:51.175
indicate considerable stress levels.

12:51.177 --> 12:52.843
Latency also suggests that he was...

12:52.845 --> 12:54.445
thinking about his answers.

12:54.447 --> 12:56.313
Perhaps he wasn't prepped
for a kidnapping.

12:56.315 --> 12:57.415
Mm, but the fact that

12:57.417 --> 12:59.650
he needed a specific
amount of money, fast,

12:59.652 --> 13:01.652
suggests it was planned.

13:01.654 --> 13:03.988
Maybe Dede wasn't setting the figures.

13:03.990 --> 13:05.156
A third party?

13:05.958 --> 13:07.258
If a third party is involved,

13:07.260 --> 13:09.193
we need to find out who and why

13:09.195 --> 13:11.128
before they take control
of the Bonnar family.

13:11.130 --> 13:13.097
Even if the kidnap wasn't planned,

13:13.099 --> 13:15.800
there is a reason that Dede
was in that house.

13:17.303 --> 13:19.170
Shall we, Mr. Yates?

13:29.982 --> 13:32.716
He was a doctor, like I said.

13:32.718 --> 13:34.285
I'm not...

13:34.287 --> 13:35.920
I won't lie to you.

13:37.223 --> 13:39.490
We both want out
of this situation, right?

13:43.162 --> 13:45.896
My daughter's sick. She needs a doctor.

14:05.985 --> 14:07.284
I'm really thirsty.

14:08.454 --> 14:10.688
She has a fever.

14:10.690 --> 14:12.823
She needs water, for God's sake.

14:21.033 --> 14:22.066
Where are you?

14:22.068 --> 14:23.000
On the road.

14:23.657 --> 14:26.237
Interesting time for a road trip.

14:26.239 --> 14:27.905
Someone showed up.

14:27.907 --> 14:29.340
I thought it was the police.

14:29.342 --> 14:31.475
I need somewhere to make the exchange.

14:31.477 --> 14:33.310
You agreed to two million?

14:33.312 --> 14:35.346
Yeah, just like you said.

14:35.348 --> 14:36.547
Well done.

14:36.549 --> 14:38.148
I know a place.

14:38.150 --> 14:39.350
Okay, where?

14:39.352 --> 14:41.886
It's a little out of town,
somewhere safe.

14:41.888 --> 14:43.521
We have to make this quick.

14:43.523 --> 14:45.055
Can't be long before the
neighbors report something

14:45.057 --> 14:46.390
and the cops show up.

14:46.392 --> 14:48.559
Well, I just took a quadruple
espresso to the head.

14:48.561 --> 14:50.427
Speed won't be a problem.

14:50.429 --> 14:52.596
Oh.

14:54.133 --> 14:56.433
This alarm auto-arms
when you lock the doors,

14:56.435 --> 14:57.668
but it's set to manual.

14:57.670 --> 14:59.803
Oh. Is there an entry log?

14:59.805 --> 15:02.473
No. Hasn't been armed for days.

15:02.475 --> 15:03.107
Careless?

15:03.109 --> 15:04.642
Yep. Or convenient.

15:04.644 --> 15:05.442
Hmm.

15:06.546 --> 15:08.317
Well, he didn't take...

15:08.748 --> 15:11.315
the wife's credit cards or cash.

15:11.317 --> 15:12.650
Hmm.

15:12.652 --> 15:14.084
I'm getting the data.

15:16.455 --> 15:18.322
Come on, come on, come on.

15:18.324 --> 15:20.324
Got it.

15:25.231 --> 15:28.997
But he did manage to find
the very well-hidden safe...

15:30.069 --> 15:32.770
and bring the exact
tools to bust it open.

15:32.772 --> 15:33.604
Really?

15:33.606 --> 15:34.872
Yeah. Tipped off?

15:34.874 --> 15:37.808
We know Bonnar did take out
a half-a-mill in cash

15:37.810 --> 15:39.677
in the last couple days.

15:39.679 --> 15:41.478
So Dede comes here looking for cash

15:41.480 --> 15:43.113
but finds the safe empty.

15:43.115 --> 15:44.214
The family comes home

15:44.216 --> 15:46.417
in the middle of the day, surprises him.

15:46.419 --> 15:47.418
He's cornered.

15:47.420 --> 15:48.786
Kidnap was Dede's plan "B"?

15:48.788 --> 15:50.988
Or maybe it was never
in his cards at all.

15:50.990 --> 15:52.456
He just rolled with the punches.

15:52.458 --> 15:54.325
Well, if he's an amateur,
he's even more dangerous...

15:54.327 --> 15:55.960
erratic, emotional...

15:55.962 --> 15:57.261
What's that?

16:04.470 --> 16:06.337
Looks like sulfur.

16:06.339 --> 16:08.439
Not the kind you'd find in a drugstore.

16:13.713 --> 16:15.779
I'll send this to Eric.

16:15.781 --> 16:17.481
- Got it.
- Okay. Come on, let's go.

16:20.152 --> 16:21.719
So the nearest plant

16:21.721 --> 16:24.555
processing industrial sulfur
of this kind

16:24.557 --> 16:28.359
is 70 miles away, but it all
ships through here.

16:28.361 --> 16:30.227
20 bucks says Dede works here.

16:30.229 --> 16:31.862
I'd never bet against you, boss.

16:31.864 --> 16:33.364
Is that true?

16:34.200 --> 16:36.066
But the company has no Arabic names

16:36.068 --> 16:38.002
listed on their employee records.

16:38.004 --> 16:40.304
Their official employee records.

16:42.742 --> 16:44.341
Wait here.

16:50.483 --> 16:52.316
I need to know where we're going.

16:54.220 --> 16:57.721
Because if it's any distance,
I got to tell you, we need gas.

16:59.458 --> 17:01.725
Okay. Pull over at the next station.

17:01.727 --> 17:03.661
I talked to those two gentlemen.

17:03.663 --> 17:06.896
Dede's real name is Mahmoud Farouk.

17:06.898 --> 17:10.099
He's 5'7," educated... and Egyptian.

17:10.102 --> 17:11.367
Yes!

17:17.242 --> 17:18.642
You're coming with me.

17:18.644 --> 17:20.810
You move, she dies.

17:20.813 --> 17:22.378
You do anything...

17:23.281 --> 17:24.314
...she dies.

17:24.316 --> 17:26.950
Daddy? Maria?

17:27.557 --> 17:29.486
We'll be watching, sweetheart.

17:29.488 --> 17:31.488
Go. Go!

17:37.863 --> 17:40.297
- Yes. Fill it up, please.
- Okay.

17:40.299 --> 17:42.092
Go in. Go!

17:42.668 --> 17:45.402
If we could get someone's attention,
hold up a note, maybe.

17:45.404 --> 17:46.503
No! No.

17:46.505 --> 17:47.738
I've been trained for this.

17:48.708 --> 17:50.407
We stay calm...

17:50.409 --> 17:52.810
we do as he says, we don't
antagonize, we'll be fine.

17:52.812 --> 17:53.844
We'll all be fine.

17:53.846 --> 17:56.714
You're right. Nothing to endanger Sofia.

18:03.923 --> 18:05.456
This is happening again.

18:06.759 --> 18:08.092
It must be me.

18:08.094 --> 18:09.993
As long as we're together, we're okay.

18:09.995 --> 18:12.362
Okay? We have to be.

18:12.364 --> 18:13.797
I love you so much.

18:13.799 --> 18:15.099
I love you more.

18:29.648 --> 18:31.115
Oh, no. No, no, no, no!

18:40.760 --> 18:42.326
Stay calm.

19:08.287 --> 19:09.920
Drive! Now!

19:18.130 --> 19:20.931
Mahmoud Farouk came
to Italy to do a PhD,

19:20.933 --> 19:22.332
overstayed his student visa.

19:22.334 --> 19:23.567
Both parents are dead,

19:23.569 --> 19:27.304
but... he has a famous younger brother.

19:27.306 --> 19:29.006
Court case coming up in two months.

19:29.008 --> 19:31.775
Could be looking at
something worse than life.

19:31.777 --> 19:34.378
I think Dede planned
a robbery, not a kidnapping.

19:34.380 --> 19:35.813
To help pay for
his brother's legal fees.

19:35.815 --> 19:38.215
You know a lawyer
who does discounts, holler.

19:38.217 --> 19:40.083
I could sure use one.

19:40.085 --> 19:42.986
For a PhD student, he made
a pretty good house-breaker.

19:42.988 --> 19:45.422
Lot easier when the alarm's off.

19:45.424 --> 19:48.525
You think he had help
from someone inside that house?

19:48.527 --> 19:50.627
I wonder who was last out
the front door this morning.

19:50.629 --> 19:52.596
When did he marry Maria?

19:52.598 --> 19:54.565
About 14 months ago.

19:54.567 --> 19:56.934
Two years after
his first wife was killed.

19:56.936 --> 19:59.469
Why would she set up her own husband?

19:59.471 --> 20:00.504
And wouldn't she have known

20:00.506 --> 20:02.673
that the half-mill wasn't in the safe?

20:02.675 --> 20:03.974
Both good questions,

20:03.976 --> 20:05.609
neither of which I have the answer to.

20:05.611 --> 20:07.044
Where's the car right now?

20:08.447 --> 20:10.747
Got it. Headed up the mountain.

20:10.749 --> 20:13.016
- All right. Time to call.
- Mm-hmm.

20:13.018 --> 20:14.318
Fire it up.

20:14.320 --> 20:15.586
Have something for me?

20:15.588 --> 20:18.488
- Two million euros in 50s.
- Ah.

20:19.558 --> 20:21.225
Impeccable timing, as ever, Ms. Denard,

20:21.227 --> 20:23.560
but I'm only gonna need 500,000.

20:23.562 --> 20:25.162
Renegotiation.

20:26.065 --> 20:28.465
Get our Egyptian kidnapper on the phone.

20:41.480 --> 20:42.479
Yes?

20:42.481 --> 20:44.314
This is Eric. To whom am I speaking?

20:44.316 --> 20:45.883
Dede.

20:45.885 --> 20:48.018
Ah, it's good to hear your voice, Dede.

20:48.020 --> 20:49.753
How's everybody bearing up?

20:49.755 --> 20:52.222
They're fine. Let's talk money.
The two million euros.

20:52.224 --> 20:54.424
Well, I'm looking at a big bag
of euros with your name on it.

20:54.426 --> 20:55.592
Where do you want to meet?

20:55.594 --> 20:56.860
Uh, there's a car park

20:56.862 --> 20:59.763
at the Parcourale de Colognora

20:59.765 --> 21:01.899
at the end of a small road... SP6...

21:03.035 --> 21:04.468
All right, repeat that last number.

21:04.470 --> 21:06.270
The line broke up.
I don't want to lose you.

21:06.272 --> 21:08.872
The S-P-6-5.

21:14.413 --> 21:16.713
One road in, single track.

21:16.715 --> 21:18.682
Clear sight line from the hills.

21:18.684 --> 21:19.850
Oh.

21:22.388 --> 21:23.720
What?

21:23.722 --> 21:26.256
If Dede is being
directed by a third party,

21:26.258 --> 21:28.592
he could've chosen this location.

21:28.594 --> 21:29.826
So?

21:29.828 --> 21:30.961
So whoever's calling the shots

21:30.963 --> 21:32.462
could be planning on taking the cash

21:32.464 --> 21:35.428
and getting rid of the witnesses.

21:36.101 --> 21:37.834
It's not a location for an exchange.

21:37.836 --> 21:39.369
It's a deathtrap.

21:41.840 --> 21:43.407
Hello? Can you hear me?!

21:45.311 --> 21:47.786
- What are you doing?!
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, the road's bad!

21:47.788 --> 21:49.680
If you can't hold a phone
and a gun at the same time,

21:49.682 --> 21:50.580
just put it on speaker!

21:50.582 --> 21:51.648
Why? You want to listen?!

21:51.650 --> 21:53.150
 She wants to stay alive!

21:53.538 --> 21:56.386
Please, just... listen to me.

21:56.388 --> 21:57.888
I was kidnapped before

21:57.890 --> 22:00.355
and it ended badly, very badly.

22:00.933 --> 22:03.467
I don't want this to go the same way.

22:03.762 --> 22:05.729
If we work together,

22:05.731 --> 22:07.898
we all get what we want.

22:07.900 --> 22:09.299
Please.

22:12.484 --> 22:13.517
Okay.

22:19.211 --> 22:21.745
Thank you. Thank you.

22:21.747 --> 22:23.403
Mahmoud, it's Eric.

22:24.183 --> 22:25.716
I need you to stop the car...

22:25.718 --> 22:27.384
and turn around.

22:27.386 --> 22:28.418
What is this?!

22:28.420 --> 22:29.920
I know your name is Mahmoud Farouk

22:29.922 --> 22:31.488
and that none of this is your idea.

22:32.524 --> 22:34.257
The man who told you
to ask for two million,

22:34.259 --> 22:35.492
the man who is waiting
for you in the hills,

22:35.494 --> 22:36.960
you cannot trust him.

22:36.962 --> 22:40.130
Do you understand? You can't trust him.

22:40.132 --> 22:41.531
You're a student,

22:41.533 --> 22:42.833
not a criminal.

22:42.835 --> 22:44.434
You're assuming all the risk.

22:44.436 --> 22:45.402
Now, he has told you that

22:45.404 --> 22:47.904
there was 500,000 in that safe.

22:47.906 --> 22:50.107
This is not about money,
it is about your brother,

22:50.109 --> 22:51.408
and I can help you with that.

22:52.444 --> 22:53.944
Can you hear me?

22:55.114 --> 22:57.147
You need to turn around right now.

22:59.251 --> 23:01.385
Dede, look at Sofia.

23:01.387 --> 23:03.020
She is 14 years old.

23:03.022 --> 23:04.588
I know you don't want to harm her.

23:04.590 --> 23:06.690
Dede? Can you hear me?

23:08.293 --> 23:10.630
Dede, stop the car now.

23:11.063 --> 23:13.997
If we turn back, there will be cops
and who knows what this guy will do.

23:14.867 --> 23:16.119
What did she say?!

23:16.653 --> 23:17.885
What did she say?!

23:19.338 --> 23:21.204
Dede, stop the car, now.

23:39.758 --> 23:41.091
Stop!

24:15.127 --> 24:17.527
Go back. Go back!

24:24.536 --> 24:26.937
Go! Go!

24:26.939 --> 24:28.238
Go!

24:28.240 --> 24:29.739
Drive! Drive!

24:29.741 --> 24:31.274
Go! Go!

24:34.324 --> 24:36.157
Go! Go! Go!!

24:36.159 --> 24:37.859
That's a rifle, not a pistol.

24:37.861 --> 24:40.817
And you see... these shadows?

24:40.932 --> 24:43.900
Echoes. It was fired
from outside the car.

24:44.389 --> 24:46.556
If the shooter was waiting for Dede,

24:46.558 --> 24:47.890
why would he fire at him?

24:47.892 --> 24:49.926
Clip to two seconds before that.

24:49.928 --> 24:51.194
 Stop!

24:51.196 --> 24:53.763
The car stops, then backs
up before the shots.

24:53.765 --> 24:55.565
Dede doesn't trust him.

24:55.567 --> 24:57.066
Money in a backpack, water,

24:57.068 --> 24:58.134
and boots for climbing.

24:58.136 --> 24:59.302
Where are you going?

24:59.304 --> 25:01.104
If this third party's shooting on sight,

25:01.106 --> 25:02.138
we should call the police.

25:02.140 --> 25:03.339
If Dede turning around

25:03.341 --> 25:05.308
antagonizes him enough to shoot...

25:05.310 --> 25:07.877
imagine what police sirens will do.

25:07.879 --> 25:09.979
Okay, we need to make the deal
and get the family out of there.

25:09.981 --> 25:12.215
You still got the live track
on Christian's phone?

25:13.151 --> 25:14.517
Let's go.

25:26.698 --> 25:28.631
Who the hell is shooting at us?!

25:39.277 --> 25:42.111
We need to go down, back to the
city, meet the negotiator.

25:42.113 --> 25:43.946
No! The police will be waiting.

25:43.948 --> 25:45.248
No, they won't.

25:45.658 --> 25:47.183
Eric, he's got your money...

25:47.185 --> 25:49.786
the money you need for your
brother, like he said.

25:49.788 --> 25:51.954
The car's not going to make it.

25:52.857 --> 25:55.224
A bullet must've hit the oil pan.

25:58.930 --> 26:00.830
I know a place we can go.

26:00.832 --> 26:02.365
There's an old castle.

26:02.367 --> 26:04.200
I think there's water there.

26:05.619 --> 26:07.069
Dede asked "What did she say?"

26:07.071 --> 26:08.304
a few seconds before the shots.

26:08.306 --> 26:09.939
Now, assuming
he was talking about Maria,

26:09.941 --> 26:12.241
can you isolate what she said?

26:12.243 --> 26:14.177
I believe I can.

26:15.180 --> 26:16.679
If we turn back, there will be cops

26:16.681 --> 26:18.714
and who knows what this guy will do.

26:18.716 --> 26:21.350
Why would Maria want them
to keep on driving?

26:22.520 --> 26:24.420
Scared of Dede on the face of it?

26:24.422 --> 26:27.490
Yeah, scared or concerned?

26:27.492 --> 26:29.959
It's time we took
a closer look at Maria.

26:51.950 --> 26:53.916
Are you sure this is a good idea?

26:53.918 --> 26:55.451
Sofia needs water and shelter.

26:55.453 --> 26:57.053
We'll find both up there.

26:58.156 --> 27:00.423
There's nothing else we can do.

27:00.425 --> 27:02.391
Go. Go!

27:04.696 --> 27:05.995
Get Eric.

27:07.966 --> 27:09.432
 You there?

27:09.434 --> 27:11.367
Yeah, we're just doing some sightseeing.

27:12.337 --> 27:14.470
Okay, there are two Maria Schwartzes

27:14.472 --> 27:16.610
on the birth register in Moutier.

27:17.075 --> 27:19.642
One of them is 73.

27:19.644 --> 27:22.378
The other one died in 1952.

27:25.116 --> 27:26.749
Eyes on the road.

27:39.130 --> 27:40.863
What... what is it? Are you okay?

27:40.865 --> 27:42.899
These aren't exactly made for walking.

27:42.901 --> 27:44.467
Will the girl be all right?

27:44.469 --> 27:47.003
She's sick. She needs water.

27:47.005 --> 27:48.571
Of course she's not all right.

27:49.974 --> 27:51.741
Come on.

27:55.780 --> 27:57.947
Oh, wow. Now we're talking.

27:57.949 --> 28:00.016
I think they are the same woman.

28:08.393 --> 28:10.726
We'll get some water
at the refuge, like you said.

28:10.728 --> 28:12.094
Ah!

28:12.096 --> 28:14.196
What... Maria!

28:14.198 --> 28:15.464
You're amazing!

28:15.466 --> 28:16.566
Quick, the phone!

28:16.568 --> 28:18.034
Call the negotiator.

28:18.036 --> 28:19.869
The number will be the last one
on the recent calls.

28:19.871 --> 28:21.737
Now is not the time.

28:23.775 --> 28:25.141
Maria?

28:25.143 --> 28:26.509
This is Maria?

28:26.511 --> 28:29.445
A.K.A. bereaved widow Sabrina Moreau...

28:29.447 --> 28:31.314
husband was murdered in a burglary,

28:31.316 --> 28:32.748
killer was never found.

28:32.750 --> 28:34.283
France, five years ago.

28:34.285 --> 28:36.152
And this...

28:36.154 --> 28:37.853
Linde Mertens...

28:37.855 --> 28:39.589
widow of murdered millionaire Luuk,

28:39.591 --> 28:41.991
burglary, no suspects ever ID'd.

28:41.993 --> 28:43.993
Netherlands, eight years ago.

28:43.995 --> 28:45.795
She marries men and murders them.

28:45.797 --> 28:47.530
And as they're unsolved...

28:47.532 --> 28:49.498
The inheritance goes to the wife.

28:49.500 --> 28:52.028
Yeah. She probably has a partner.

28:52.470 --> 28:53.736
- What are you doing?
- No, no, no, no.

28:53.738 --> 28:55.404
We need to go down, negotiate.

28:55.406 --> 28:57.106
Maria, please!

28:57.108 --> 28:58.674
There's water up there, right?

28:58.676 --> 29:00.776
So shut up and let's go. You, too.

29:00.778 --> 29:02.445
You're with him, aren't you?

29:02.447 --> 29:04.614
With "him"? What are you talking about?

29:04.616 --> 29:05.848
Jakob.

29:05.850 --> 29:08.084
He told me you had cash in the safe.

29:08.086 --> 29:10.086
Now I know who told him.

29:10.088 --> 29:11.988
Who the hell is Jakob?

29:11.990 --> 29:14.223
I said, "Go!"

29:41.853 --> 29:44.086
Okay, I cross ref'd where they're headed

29:44.088 --> 29:46.756
with Christian's frequently
visited locations.

29:46.758 --> 29:48.991
Him and Moretti hunt in these mountains.

29:48.993 --> 29:51.927
And they use
this hilltop ruin as a base.

29:51.929 --> 29:53.562
And the only way you
can get there by car

29:53.564 --> 29:55.931
is using the road
you're driving on right now.

29:55.933 --> 29:58.134
How long was she married
to her previous husbands?

29:58.136 --> 30:01.103
Um, six and nine months.

30:01.105 --> 30:03.739
Well, she's stayed
with Christian for 18.

30:03.741 --> 30:06.075
What's different about this one?

30:06.077 --> 30:08.477
Any of the previous husbands
have children?

30:08.479 --> 30:09.912
Negative.

30:10.915 --> 30:12.782
Ollie, what's her profile?

30:12.784 --> 30:13.783
I'm speculating...

30:13.785 --> 30:15.384
but the consummate role-player

30:15.386 --> 30:17.253
usually indicates difficulty forming

30:17.255 --> 30:19.889
real or lasting relationships.

30:19.891 --> 30:22.391
Likely from a dysfunctional family.

30:22.393 --> 30:24.026
Bottom line, tough cookie to negotiate

30:24.028 --> 30:26.128
given her lack of
self-esteem and self-worth.

30:26.130 --> 30:27.596
She feels like she has nothing to lose.

30:27.598 --> 30:29.665
Well, until now.

30:29.667 --> 30:31.267
This one's got to her.

30:31.269 --> 30:32.935
Daughters can do that.

30:34.005 --> 30:36.806
I got hold of a copy
of Christian's will.

30:36.808 --> 30:38.607
Sending now.

30:38.609 --> 30:40.042
Eric, look.

30:43.915 --> 30:45.114
Yeah.

30:54.926 --> 30:56.592
It's empty.

31:06.537 --> 31:08.804
The shooter would spot that, too.

31:13.111 --> 31:14.643
How does Maria do it?

31:14.645 --> 31:17.379
I mean, spend her entire life in a lie.

31:17.381 --> 31:19.749
Ev-Every time she looks at Christian,

31:19.751 --> 31:21.117
every time he looks at her,

31:21.119 --> 31:22.318
it's just...

31:22.320 --> 31:24.053
always an act.

31:24.055 --> 31:25.755
Well, that's marriage for you.

31:27.358 --> 31:29.925
Good liars create a convincing fiction.

31:29.927 --> 31:32.161
Great liars create a fiction

31:32.163 --> 31:33.596
that's true for them.

31:33.598 --> 31:34.864
Cognitive dissonance.

31:34.866 --> 31:36.165
Mm-hmm.

31:36.167 --> 31:37.706
That's so ingrained.

31:38.369 --> 31:39.802
How do you undo it?

31:39.804 --> 31:41.704
Well, I'm working on it.

31:52.016 --> 31:53.048
Here, baby. Cuddle up.

31:53.050 --> 31:54.250
Keep warm while I get water.

31:54.252 --> 31:55.551
Stop. On your knees.

32:07.665 --> 32:08.898
No!

32:19.443 --> 32:20.242
I'm going back.

32:20.244 --> 32:21.410
Christian.

32:21.746 --> 32:23.112
I don't know what this is...

32:23.522 --> 32:25.948
but if there's anything left
of the woman I married,

32:25.950 --> 32:27.383
you'll let me help my daughter.

32:27.385 --> 32:29.051
Christian, you don't understand!

32:29.053 --> 32:30.553
You'll have to shoot me.

32:33.357 --> 32:35.324
Daddy!

32:36.678 --> 32:39.035
What's happening? Where are they?

32:39.037 --> 32:40.761
They're in the mountains.

32:41.517 --> 32:43.250
We've lost comms.

32:47.590 --> 32:49.757
Daddy, are you okay?!

32:52.095 --> 32:54.128
Who are you?

32:54.130 --> 32:56.063
No one you know.

32:56.065 --> 32:57.131
Help him.

33:03.272 --> 33:04.872
Daddy?!

33:06.576 --> 33:07.942
Everything's okay.

33:13.116 --> 33:14.582
Who's Jakob?

33:14.584 --> 33:16.350
He's... He's some guy

33:16.352 --> 33:18.886
who could get me money for my brother.

33:18.888 --> 33:20.521
All I had to do was break your window.

33:20.523 --> 33:22.623
He told me how to get into your safe.

33:22.625 --> 33:24.391
He even gave me the tools,

33:24.393 --> 33:26.327
but it was empty.

33:26.329 --> 33:29.330
You coming home wasn't part of the plan.

33:31.734 --> 33:33.367
Who's Jakob to you?

33:35.471 --> 33:36.937
Like he said.

33:38.441 --> 33:39.974
Just some guy.

33:50.953 --> 33:53.921
- Come on.
- Eric said this place is a deathtrap.

33:53.923 --> 33:55.389
We know that man's a killer,

33:55.391 --> 33:57.391
and yet, he goes straight onto it.

33:59.362 --> 34:01.495
Another day at the office.

34:03.366 --> 34:05.900
I trusted you with my daughter.

34:05.902 --> 34:07.568
How could you do this?

34:07.570 --> 34:09.036
It's what she does.

34:10.540 --> 34:12.505
I'm Eric, the negotiator.

34:13.743 --> 34:15.179
You're Maria.

34:15.844 --> 34:18.560
And Sabrina. And Linde.

34:18.562 --> 34:20.380
Maybe more besides.

34:20.382 --> 34:21.482
You're not the only one.

34:21.484 --> 34:24.385
Marries, murders, moves on.

34:24.387 --> 34:25.819
It's quite the MO.

34:25.821 --> 34:27.855
Put your weapon where I can see it.

34:27.857 --> 34:29.255
I don't carry a gun.

34:29.257 --> 34:31.759
What about your friend
in the rocks back there?

34:33.262 --> 34:34.562
No guns.

34:34.563 --> 34:36.563
All I have is water.

34:36.565 --> 34:37.864
I'm pretty sure this isn't how anyone

34:37.867 --> 34:40.201
expected their day to go.

34:40.203 --> 34:42.002
But I promise you,

34:42.592 --> 34:44.038
everyone's gonna leave the mountain

34:44.040 --> 34:45.339
with what they need.

34:46.375 --> 34:47.908
Now, how about I start by showing you

34:47.909 --> 34:50.010
the half-million euros in this bag...

34:51.746 --> 34:53.880
...and my colleague
gets some water to the girl?

34:53.882 --> 34:55.916
Two million was the deal!

34:55.918 --> 34:58.452
500,000 is what she told you
was in the safe...

34:58.454 --> 35:00.487
right, Maria?

35:01.324 --> 35:02.590
Right?

35:03.559 --> 35:06.527
You take it and you walk away clean

35:06.529 --> 35:09.763
with the amount you
expected from the robbery,

35:09.765 --> 35:11.932
in exchange for the family
and Mr. Farouk here.

35:11.934 --> 35:14.535
I'm sure he'd be happy
to forgo his share.

35:15.371 --> 35:16.971
What do you think, baby?

35:19.141 --> 35:20.341
Why not?

35:20.840 --> 35:22.476
Go ahead.

35:38.294 --> 35:40.861
Keep pressure on that wound.

35:40.863 --> 35:42.730
That right, Maria?

35:42.732 --> 35:45.099
It is the, uh, money that you want?

35:45.433 --> 35:47.301
Why wouldn't it be?

35:47.592 --> 35:50.170
Well, why would you put a bullet
in Christian's shoulder?

35:50.172 --> 35:51.575
Why not his head?

35:52.074 --> 35:54.926
You two always run this scam
to a strict time frame.

35:55.411 --> 35:57.945
In and out in under a year.

35:57.947 --> 36:00.614
Now, you've been with
Christian 18 months,

36:00.616 --> 36:02.716
even though he put you
in his will after just 12.

36:02.718 --> 36:03.984
What did he say?

36:03.986 --> 36:05.886
Nothing important.

36:06.689 --> 36:07.688
Give me the handgun

36:07.690 --> 36:09.423
so I can make this look right.

36:10.199 --> 36:11.925
Just wait.

36:13.596 --> 36:16.117
We kill them all,
pin it on the Egyptian,

36:16.119 --> 36:17.264
and let's get out of here!

36:17.266 --> 36:18.632
I said, "Wait!"

36:22.605 --> 36:24.171
You didn't know Christian had a daughter

36:24.173 --> 36:26.007
when you met him, did you?

36:26.609 --> 36:28.042
Stealing from the safe

36:28.044 --> 36:30.277
was your way of getting
the money without killing him.

36:30.279 --> 36:32.446
I think you didn't want him to get hurt.

36:33.449 --> 36:34.848
And you still don't.

36:34.850 --> 36:37.051
Baby, take the cash and let's go.

36:37.053 --> 36:38.252
Well, you heard the man,

36:38.254 --> 36:39.586
you know the drill.

36:39.588 --> 36:40.821
Once you give him that gun,

36:40.823 --> 36:42.556
he is going to kill them both, and us,

36:42.558 --> 36:44.425
maybe even get away with it...

36:44.427 --> 36:46.760
if the police don't get here first.

36:47.530 --> 36:48.962
Is he really the family you choose?

36:48.964 --> 36:51.065
Baby, don't listen to him!

36:51.067 --> 36:52.866
I am offering you the chance

36:52.868 --> 36:54.568
to be free of him, to walk away...

36:54.570 --> 36:56.804
to just... walk away.

37:10.252 --> 37:11.652
What are you doing?

37:17.760 --> 37:19.526
I'm sorry.

37:26.669 --> 37:28.836
Jana.

37:30.406 --> 37:31.638
Jana.

37:32.742 --> 37:34.028
What are you doing?

37:34.477 --> 37:35.609
It's over.

37:35.611 --> 37:38.412
Mr. Farouk, take the rifle.

37:39.749 --> 37:41.448
Jana. Jana!

37:45.621 --> 37:47.087
Jana!

37:47.089 --> 37:49.757
Come back, Jana! Come back!

37:50.893 --> 37:52.192
I'll kill you, Jana!

37:52.194 --> 37:53.727
Jana!

37:55.664 --> 37:57.698
Steady hands, Dede.

38:09.044 --> 38:10.744
Grazie mille, Capitano.

38:10.746 --> 38:11.743
Prego.

38:20.089 --> 38:21.989
Put in a call to our man in Cairo.

38:21.991 --> 38:24.591
See if we can't find
Mr. Farouk's brother a good lawyer.

38:24.593 --> 38:26.059
Will do.

38:30.065 --> 38:31.799
How is she?

38:31.801 --> 38:32.966
Improving.

38:32.968 --> 38:34.001
Mm-hmm.

38:34.003 --> 38:35.370
Thank you.

38:35.871 --> 38:37.604
For the little that it's worth,

38:37.606 --> 38:39.373
she really did love you.

38:40.476 --> 38:42.276
Both of you.

39:00.029 --> 39:01.495
You okay?

39:02.531 --> 39:04.974
No young girl should lose her mother.

39:05.768 --> 39:07.501
She's lost two.

39:09.472 --> 39:11.171
Well, 20 bucks says she goes on

39:11.173 --> 39:12.840
to do them both proud.

39:21.383 --> 39:24.151
The company thanks you,
once again, Mr. Beaumont.

39:24.153 --> 39:25.788
Just the company?

39:26.555 --> 39:28.255
Or we could skip the country

39:28.257 --> 39:30.030
and have one hell of a weekend.

39:31.694 --> 39:33.293
Well, you can't blame a guy for trying.

39:34.497 --> 39:37.564
I thought I was gonna lose you.

39:37.566 --> 39:39.733
Me? Nah.

39:41.537 --> 39:43.237
Call for you.

39:47.376 --> 39:49.543
Well, as soon as I get on that plane,

39:49.545 --> 39:51.545
it's lights out,

39:51.547 --> 39:52.880
no one wake me up.

39:52.882 --> 39:54.781
I'm heading to
the airport right now, baby.

39:54.783 --> 39:56.550
I will be walking
in the door in 10 hours.

39:56.552 --> 39:57.885
I love you, bye.

39:57.887 --> 39:59.386
Oh. Did you guys...

39:59.388 --> 40:01.288
not hear about the change of plan?

40:01.290 --> 40:02.556
What plan?

40:02.558 --> 40:04.458
Another case?

40:04.460 --> 40:05.792
Eric...

40:05.794 --> 40:07.094
Say hi to everybody, Evie.

40:07.096 --> 40:08.829
Hey, Evie. Hi, Evie.

40:08.831 --> 40:10.998
Goodnight, Evie.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.733
Not funny.

40:12.735 --> 40:13.934
Bye, Nathalie.

40:13.936 --> 40:15.202
Bye.

40:16.205 --> 40:17.471
À bientôt.

40:17.473 --> 40:19.273
Take care.

40:20.442 --> 40:22.009
That wasn't weird at all.

40:22.011 --> 40:24.111
- Bye, Nathalie.
- I was just doing what I do.

40:24.113 --> 40:26.880
Using you to manipulate my friends.
