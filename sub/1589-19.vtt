00:01.500 --> 00:03.297
ANNOUNCER: Previously
on Pretty Little Liars...
Ballard?

00:03.330 --> 00:04.490
I thought it was Skidmore.

00:04.530 --> 00:06.361
How many schools
did you get into?

00:06.400 --> 00:08.766
There is no rule that says
you have to go to college.

00:08.800 --> 00:11.439
That belongs to Mona.
I_ know. We were
Just looking at It.

00:11.470 --> 00:13.506
Give me the book.
You can't take
everything apart

00:13.540 --> 00:14.700
like you want her
to disappear.

00:14.740 --> 00:16.048
I don't...regret

00:16.080 --> 00:17.502
being with you,
Ezra, at all.

00:17.550 --> 00:19.245
Maybe not now,
but if we stay together--

00:19.280 --> 00:20.042
What are you saying?

00:20.080 --> 00:21.775
If you take this time
for yourself,

00:21.820 --> 00:22.809
there will be no regrets.

00:22.850 --> 00:25.182
EMILY: To be alone,
to be lonely,

00:25.220 --> 00:26.380
I know what that's like.

00:26.420 --> 00:28.388
Ashley,
will you marry me?

00:28.420 --> 00:30.126
Did you tell him
about Jason?

00:30.160 --> 00:32.253
It would just cause him
unnecessary pain.

00:32.300 --> 00:35.121
This whole town is
strung together With whispers.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.593
Somebody else
has been helping Ali.

00:36.630 --> 00:38.120
Or somebody
we'd never suspect.

00:38.170 --> 00:39.592
Ali's dangerous, Mike.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.130
Even in a cage,
she's really dangerous.

00:41.170 --> 00:42.467
Don't ever go back there
again.

00:42.510 --> 00:44.432
Nobody's giving me orders
anymore.

00:54.850 --> 00:56.681
Where's your sticker?

00:56.720 --> 00:58.415
Oh, remember my summer trip
to Haiti?

00:58.450 --> 01:00.384
Turns out I can't give blood
for another year.

01:02.460 --> 01:03.688
What?

01:03.730 --> 01:04.822
No blood.
No cookie.

01:04.860 --> 01:05.827
I didn't make
the rules.

01:05.860 --> 01:08.055
You're just too lazy
to get one.

01:13.400 --> 01:14.833
Are you done studying?

01:14.870 --> 01:16.701
I'll never be done studying
for this test.

01:16.740 --> 01:18.833
I just need the numbers
to stop spinning.

01:18.870 --> 01:21.179
Hey, and the next time
we offer to help your mom,

01:21.210 --> 01:23.576
can it please
not involve needles?

01:23.610 --> 01:25.202
How's it going over here?

01:25.250 --> 01:26.842
Great.

01:26.880 --> 01:28.575
I'm so glad
you all came to the drive.

01:28.620 --> 01:30.440
I recruited a bunch of people
from the church

01:30.490 --> 01:32.583
and they canceled on me
at the last minute.

01:32.620 --> 01:34.713
We're happy to help.

01:34.760 --> 01:36.227
Brownie?

01:40.760 --> 01:42.864
Oh, someone from the church
actually showed up.

01:42.900 --> 01:45.664
I'm gonna go say hello.

01:45.700 --> 01:47.258
Seriously?

01:47.300 --> 01:48.631
Mm-hmm.

01:50.640 --> 01:52.335
Paula.

01:52.380 --> 01:54.371
Thank you so much
for coming.

01:54.410 --> 01:55.775
I'll just have you
sign in here

01:55.810 --> 01:57.346
_ and a nurse
WIII call your name.

01:57.380 --> 01:58.802
Oh, unfortunately,
I'm not gonna be able

01:58.850 --> 02:00.647
to give blood
this morning

02:00.680 --> 02:02.648
on account of this little tickle
In my throat.

02:02.690 --> 02:05.887
Oh.
But it's so nice
to see you out and about.

02:05.920 --> 02:08.753
We've missed you at the church
these last few weeks.

02:08.790 --> 02:12.897
The Pastor
looks particularly distracted.

02:12.930 --> 02:15.228
Everything okay?

02:15.260 --> 02:17.626
Of course.

02:17.670 --> 02:20.537
Things have just been,
you know, busy.

02:20.570 --> 02:23.505
Oh, I'm sure that's what's
kept the others this morning.

02:23.540 --> 02:26.179
We're all so busy
these days.

02:26.210 --> 02:28.269
I'm gonna check
on the other donors.

02:28.310 --> 02:29.299
See if they need anything.

02:29.350 --> 02:32.239
Just one quick thing
before you go.

02:32.280 --> 02:34.441
Could you ask the Pastor

02:34.480 --> 02:37.813
about putting these up
around the church?

02:37.850 --> 02:39.784
Of course.

02:39.820 --> 02:41.685
Thank you.

02:43.430 --> 02:45.819
( plate clatters )

02:45.860 --> 02:48.727
Young man,
this is a restricted zone.

02:48.760 --> 02:50.569
What are you doing
back here?
I'm sorry.

02:50.600 --> 02:52.693
I was just interested
in how it all works.

02:52.740 --> 02:55.197
Then go sign up
and see for yourself.

02:55.240 --> 02:56.309
Yeah.

02:56.340 --> 02:57.466
Okay.

03:01.780 --> 03:02.940
Mike!

03:02.980 --> 03:04.572
Okay, what was that about?

03:06.320 --> 03:09.380
Was Mike just here to steal
cookies or something else?

03:13.990 --> 03:16.686
* Got a secret,
can you keep it? *

03:16.730 --> 03:19.426
* Swear this one
you'll save *

03:19.460 --> 03:21.724
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

03:21.760 --> 03:24.422
* Taking this one
to the grave *

03:24.470 --> 03:26.358
* If I show you,
then I know *

03:26.400 --> 03:29.437
* You won't tell
what I saId *

03:29.470 --> 03:31.836
* 'Cause two can
keep a secret *

03:31.870 --> 03:34.407
* If one of them is dead

03:35.880 --> 03:37.768
You ask Mike
why he was at the blood drive.

03:37.810 --> 03:38.970
I already know
his answer.

03:39.010 --> 03:41.319
That he was there
to donate?
0.

03:41.350 --> 03:42.612
That I should mind
my own busmess.

03:42.650 --> 03:44.379
And I got that message loud
and clear at the dock.

03:44.420 --> 03:45.887
Okay,
but it is our business.

03:45.920 --> 03:47.456
We all saw _
where he was standing, rIght?

03:47.490 --> 03:48.787
By the coolers
where they keep the blood.

03:48.820 --> 03:49.787
Our blood.

03:49.830 --> 03:50.979
Really, Spencer?

03:51.030 --> 03:51.826
Well, if he's trying
to get his hands

03:51.860 --> 03:53.259
on something
that could help Alison--

03:53.300 --> 03:54.995
So that's it?
He's guilty?

03:55.030 --> 03:57.669
God, the court of public opinion
in this town really sucks.

03:57.700 --> 03:59.531
Everyone just
take a breath, okay?

03:59.570 --> 04:00.992
Well, it's hard to breathe
when someone's trying

04:01.040 --> 04:02.860
to set you up
as an accessory to murder.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.470
Look, we still don't know
why he was visiting Ali in jail

04:05.510 --> 04:06.807
or why he fought with Mona.

04:06.840 --> 04:08.478
If they had
a serious falling out--

04:08.510 --> 04:11.001
Just stop. Please.

04:11.050 --> 04:14.019
Look, I know you're all
desperate to find out
who's helping Alison.

04:14.050 --> 04:14.869
But just because
it isn't Holbrook,

04:14.920 --> 04:16.740
does not mean
that It's my brother.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.417
Okay, Mike was in love
with Mona

04:18.450 --> 04:19.678
and he would
never hurt her.

04:19.720 --> 04:21.415
And he would never team up
with someone who did.

04:21.460 --> 04:23.018
Aria--
No. I can't
talk about this right now.

04:23.060 --> 04:24.857
I have a math test.

05:07.770 --> 05:08.930
Spencer?
Yeah.

05:08.970 --> 05:10.437
I have a question.

05:10.470 --> 05:12.404
It's college related.

05:12.440 --> 05:13.532
Okay.

05:13.580 --> 05:15.104
And I know
that's a touchy subject

05:15.140 --> 05:18.405
because I got into
all these schools and you...

05:18.450 --> 05:19.417
Okay, Hanna,

05:19.450 --> 05:21.668
what's your question?

05:21.720 --> 05:24.541
No one's offering me
financial aid.

05:24.590 --> 05:26.888
Some of these schools,
they're like $45,000 a year.

05:26.920 --> 05:27.955
My mom can't afford that.

05:27.990 --> 05:29.014
She doesn't even have a job
right now.

05:29.060 --> 05:31.028
Wait, I thought she was working
for Ali's family?

05:31.060 --> 05:32.994
Well, she was,
but she left.

05:33.030 --> 05:34.850
But I thought
after Jason came back to work--

05:34.900 --> 05:37.118
Yeah,
he did and she left.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.968
Um...

05:43.010 --> 05:47.333
Okay, well, financial aid is
based on your parents' income.

05:52.050 --> 05:54.712
They don't think
that your mom can pay,

05:54.750 --> 05:57.048
but they think
that your dad can.

05:59.090 --> 06:01.058
( bell ringing )

06:03.690 --> 06:05.578
Aria.
Hey.

06:05.630 --> 06:07.359
Aria.

06:08.660 --> 06:09.729
Oh!

06:09.770 --> 06:11.522
Hey, Andrew.
What's up?

06:11.570 --> 06:14.630
What's up is I saw you
reading my answers,

06:14.670 --> 06:16.035
copying them down.

06:17.510 --> 06:19.933
My God, I'm so sorry.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.574
Look, I couldn't focus in there
at all. I froze.

06:25.810 --> 06:28.608
I got a conditional admission
into Savannah College
of Art and Design,

06:28.650 --> 06:30.641
and if I don't make
Honor Roll this semester,

06:30.690 --> 06:32.146
they could completely withdraw
my acceptance.

06:32.190 --> 06:33.748
I-- I'm so sorry.

06:33.790 --> 06:35.155
I just-- I panicked,
and I--

06:35.190 --> 06:37.181
Slow down, okay?
I'm not mad.

06:37.230 --> 06:40.893
You're not?
No. But if you need a tutor--

06:40.930 --> 06:42.625
I don't. I--

06:42.670 --> 06:44.991
I don't. There's--

06:46.540 --> 06:48.895
There's just a lot going on
right now and I--

06:48.940 --> 06:51.761
Well, if you'd rather
get caught cheating.

06:51.810 --> 06:52.970
Wait.

06:55.540 --> 06:58.100
Um...how's tomorrow?

07:02.990 --> 07:04.810
I haven't done this
In years.

07:04.850 --> 07:05.839
Having fun?

07:05.890 --> 07:07.050
Yes.

07:07.090 --> 07:08.648
You were right.

07:08.690 --> 07:11.056
Riding downhill,
standing on your pedals.

07:11.090 --> 07:13.650
It's the closest thing
you can get to flying.

07:13.700 --> 07:14.792
Okay.

07:14.830 --> 07:16.798
Here.

07:16.830 --> 07:18.058
Come on.

07:18.100 --> 07:19.897
It's this way.

07:21.970 --> 07:23.005
Here?

07:23.040 --> 07:25.099
Here.

07:25.140 --> 07:27.529
This is where you had
your first kiss?

07:27.580 --> 07:29.070
Marvin Biglioni.

07:29.110 --> 07:31.544
The summer
after fourth grade.

07:31.580 --> 07:33.571
He looked like a frog.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.212
His cheeks
were out to here.

07:35.250 --> 07:37.980
So you were trying
to turn him into a prince?

07:38.020 --> 07:39.851
Ah,
a girl can dream.

07:40.920 --> 07:44.083
So we were
standing right here

07:44.130 --> 07:47.099
and he leans in,

07:47.130 --> 07:50.224
and right as we're about
to seal the deal

07:50.270 --> 07:53.137
on my first kiss ever,

07:53.170 --> 07:54.762
he burps.

07:54.800 --> 07:55.835
And it's wet.

07:55.870 --> 07:56.837
Ew!

07:56.870 --> 07:57.962
That's gross.

07:58.010 --> 08:00.228
And all I could think was,
"Do-over.

08:00.280 --> 08:01.770
I just want a do-over."

08:01.810 --> 08:03.141
It was awful.
Ugh.

08:05.050 --> 08:06.779
Yeah.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.640
Okay, your turn.

08:08.680 --> 08:10.045
Tell me something.

08:11.750 --> 08:14.651
Uh...my first kiss?

08:14.690 --> 08:17.158
I don't know
if we can bike there from here.

08:18.230 --> 08:19.527
Um, no.

08:19.560 --> 08:23.018
Tell me your biggest fear.

08:25.300 --> 08:27.268
Um...

08:27.300 --> 08:30.007
Okay, you know what,
stupid question.

08:30.040 --> 08:31.302
No.
No, it's not.

08:31.340 --> 08:32.876
It's just...

08:32.910 --> 08:35.629
Too soon?

08:35.680 --> 08:37.204
I get that.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.878
I mean, there are things

08:39.920 --> 08:42.582
I'm not ready
to talk about either.

08:51.260 --> 08:52.557
What was that for?

08:52.600 --> 08:54.659
Do-over.

08:58.370 --> 08:59.598
( door closes )

09:05.810 --> 09:08.802
Mom, are you okay?

09:09.950 --> 09:11.303
I talked to him.

09:11.350 --> 09:13.648
Ted.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.978
I stopped by the church
after the blood drive.

09:16.020 --> 09:17.942
He deserved an answer.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.555
What did you say?

09:23.360 --> 09:25.089
I said yes.

09:25.130 --> 09:26.950
I said
I wanted to marry him.

09:29.970 --> 09:34.339
And then I told him about
what happened when he was away.

09:34.370 --> 09:35.894
You did?

09:40.040 --> 09:41.576
What did he say?

09:44.380 --> 09:46.610
He said
he needed to think.

09:48.420 --> 09:52.288
He said he would call me in
a couple of hours.

09:52.320 --> 09:54.914
He couldn't even look at me,
Hanna.

10:01.130 --> 10:02.825
I'm gonna
make us some dinner.

10:02.870 --> 10:05.623
Is there stuff
for a salad?

10:14.880 --> 10:16.700
ARIA: Yeah, and you thought
Melissa was "A".

10:16.750 --> 10:18.172
And you were wrong about that.
Remember?

10:18.210 --> 10:19.939
I know. But...

10:21.280 --> 10:23.714
Look, I promise
to keep an eye on Mike

10:23.750 --> 10:25.980
if you promise
not to jump to conclusions.

10:26.020 --> 10:28.250
Fine. Deal.

10:28.290 --> 10:29.416
Okay.

10:29.460 --> 10:32.850
So what are you and Toby
doing tonight?

10:32.900 --> 10:35.391
We're not.
SomethIng came up.

10:35.430 --> 10:37.261
What about you and Ezra?

10:37.300 --> 10:39.325
Got any Friday night plans?

10:39.370 --> 10:41.861
Uh, no.
No.

10:41.900 --> 10:45.404
I'm staying in to prepare
for a study session with Andrew.

10:45.440 --> 10:47.305
Andrew Campbell?

10:47.340 --> 10:48.898
Be careful there.

10:48.940 --> 10:49.907
Why?

10:49.950 --> 10:53.044
Um...the dimples, mostly.

10:55.180 --> 10:56.340
Okay.
I should get back to it.

10:56.380 --> 10:57.881
Talk later?

10:57.920 --> 10:59.911
Later.

11:04.930 --> 11:06.921
Hel_|o.
HI.

11:11.070 --> 11:13.766
Oh. This part
of the rental agreement?

11:13.800 --> 11:15.859
You get to raid our fridge?

11:17.210 --> 11:18.905
Thought you had plans
with Toby.

11:18.940 --> 11:20.908
Well, something came up.

11:20.940 --> 11:21.929
Duty calls.

11:23.480 --> 11:25.038
Cop stuff.

11:25.080 --> 11:27.947
Yeah, that's the technical term
for it.

11:29.120 --> 11:32.180
I'm painting a mural
at Hollis tonight.

11:32.220 --> 11:33.312
Wow!

11:33.360 --> 11:35.453
That's like a huge get.
It is.

11:35.490 --> 11:38.926
And I_could use
my IllustrIous aSSIstant

11:38.960 --> 11:40.723
if you're available.

11:40.760 --> 11:42.318
I don't know,
my mom really wants me

11:42.360 --> 11:45.329
to email a bunch
of these family contacts.

11:45.370 --> 11:47.736
Back on the college track?
Yeah.

11:47.770 --> 11:50.330
Apparently, the Hastings
are very well connected.

11:50.370 --> 11:55.376
And I have
a third cousin twice removed
who works at Colby College.

11:56.540 --> 11:58.747
I promise you a real dinner
if you come.

12:02.890 --> 12:05.245
( cell phone rings )

12:18.470 --> 12:20.768
Hello?
OPERATOR: This is a call

12:20.800 --> 12:23.166
from the Chester Women's
Correctional Facility.

12:23.210 --> 12:26.509
You have a call
from inmate Hank Mahoney.

12:26.540 --> 12:29.998
Press one
to accept thIs call.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.268
Alison?
( click)

12:32.310 --> 12:33.948
Alison!

12:41.020 --> 12:43.250
Do you usually paint
in the dark?

12:43.290 --> 12:44.086
Well, it's easier
this way.

12:44.130 --> 12:46.519
I don't bother the students,
faculty.

12:46.560 --> 12:48.255
They don't bother me.

12:48.300 --> 12:50.291
Can you help me
with this?

12:50.330 --> 12:51.297
This?

12:51.330 --> 12:53.036
Yeah.

12:53.070 --> 12:53.832
Where do you want it?

12:53.870 --> 12:56.065
Uh, just get it up first.
Okay.

12:58.310 --> 12:59.334
That way a little bit.

12:59.370 --> 13:00.530
Okay.

13:00.580 --> 13:02.172
Perfect.

13:03.310 --> 13:05.141
So what were you gonna do
ifI said no?

13:05.180 --> 13:07.546
Probably call Sophia.

13:07.580 --> 13:09.445
My girlfriend.
Ex-girlfriend.

13:09.480 --> 13:10.913
We just broke up.

13:10.950 --> 13:12.042
Sorry.

13:12.090 --> 13:13.284
Don't be.
It's a good thing.

13:13.320 --> 13:16.881
I tend to fall for women
who are unavailable.

13:16.930 --> 13:19.285
Emotionally or otherwise.

13:19.330 --> 13:21.457
But you were
just gonna call her aanays?

13:21.500 --> 13:22.489
I mean,
wouldn't that make her think

13:22.530 --> 13:23.827
that you were
still interested?

13:23.870 --> 13:24.894
Yes.

13:24.930 --> 13:26.158
Probably.

13:26.200 --> 13:28.339
Did I mention
how bad I am at relationships?

13:33.140 --> 13:34.971
I've never been
to this side of campus.

13:35.010 --> 13:37.171
There's nothing over here
but a bunch of old
research labs.

13:37.210 --> 13:39.269
_I'm here
to reVItaIIze the place.

13:40.950 --> 13:43.214
I used to come to Hollis a lot
when I was a kid.

13:43.250 --> 13:45.115
My parents would take
Melissa and me

13:45.150 --> 13:47.914
to this summer concert series.

13:47.960 --> 13:50.929
Back when I thought I was
gonna be a famous violinist.

13:50.960 --> 13:53.349
What happened?

13:53.400 --> 13:55.618
I'm more of an appreciator
of the arts.

13:55.660 --> 13:58.868
What's that supposed
to mean?

13:58.900 --> 14:01.960
It means,
in the Hastings family,

14:02.000 --> 14:04.332
if you don't excel
at something, you just,

14:04.370 --> 14:06.065
you move on
to the next thing.

14:06.110 --> 14:08.931
So you've never just done
something because you love it?

14:08.980 --> 14:11.608
Well, how can you love something
if you're bad at it?

14:11.650 --> 14:14.118
I usually manage.

14:17.920 --> 14:21.879
( rock music playing )
( knock on door)

14:21.920 --> 14:23.126
ARIA: Mike!

14:24.530 --> 14:26.998
Mike,
I know you're in there.

14:32.270 --> 14:33.237
What do you want?

14:33.270 --> 14:35.158
Why is Alison calling you?

14:35.200 --> 14:37.134
What?

14:37.170 --> 14:38.239
First you visit her,

14:38.270 --> 14:41.376
and now she's sending you
secret messages from jail?

14:41.410 --> 14:43.298
Who the hell is
Hank Mahoney?

14:45.010 --> 14:46.477
I have no idea.

14:47.550 --> 14:48.574
And next time
don't answer my phone.

14:48.620 --> 14:51.680
Why are you letting her
manipulate you like this?

14:51.720 --> 14:54.052
You know
what Ali's capable of.

14:55.590 --> 14:57.387
Mike, I know that you got
in a fight with Mona

14:57.430 --> 14:58.988
the night before she died.

14:59.030 --> 15:00.054
Something is going on

15:00.100 --> 15:02.091
and you have to tell me
what it is.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.959
I don't have to tell you
anything.

15:08.100 --> 15:10.568
No one_wa_nts to believe
that MIke Is helpIng A|I.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.259
But if Ali could take down
Holbrook,

15:12.310 --> 15:14.437
a grown-ass man
with a police badge,

15:14.480 --> 15:17.142
who knows what she could do
to Aria's brother.

15:17.180 --> 15:18.477
Hanna--

15:18.510 --> 15:21.343
Caleb, I have to go.

15:21.380 --> 15:24.417
Your father left a voicemail
about lunch tomorrow.

15:24.450 --> 15:26.008
He said
he's at the office all day,

15:26.050 --> 15:28.416
and you'll have to catch up
another time.

15:28.460 --> 15:32.021
There anything in particular
you need to catch up on?

15:32.060 --> 15:34.096
I was gonna
bring this up earlier.

15:34.130 --> 15:35.222
Bring up what?

15:37.070 --> 15:38.423
I found out
why none of the schools

15:38.470 --> 15:40.734
I got into are offering me
financial aid.

15:40.770 --> 15:44.729
Apparently, Dad had
a really good year last year.

15:44.770 --> 15:48.570
And Ijust wanted to talk to him
and ask him if--

15:48.610 --> 15:49.531
Hanna,

15:49.580 --> 15:52.208
your dad's financial obligation
was worked out

15:52.250 --> 15:54.241
in the divorce settlement
years ago.

15:54.280 --> 15:56.111
Well, it's not enough.

15:56.150 --> 15:58.618
Mom, I just want to
talk to him and--

15:58.650 --> 16:02.108
And what? Explain that I don't
have a job anymore, and--

16:02.160 --> 16:05.379
(sighs)
I would rather not share
that story WIth anyone else,

16:05.430 --> 16:06.727
thank you.

16:06.760 --> 16:08.455
If he's the reason
we're not getting help

16:08.500 --> 16:10.525
then he should
take on the extra expense.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.060
He has the money.

16:12.100 --> 16:13.328
Listen to me.

16:13.370 --> 16:16.498
Going to your father
is not gonna fix this.

16:18.240 --> 16:20.231
I will figure this out.

16:21.640 --> 16:23.107
Understood?

16:29.380 --> 16:31.348
Paperwork on a Friday?

16:32.220 --> 16:34.211
Just trying to stay
ahead of the game.

16:34.260 --> 16:36.353
Turns out I don't get
weekends off anymore.

16:36.390 --> 16:38.756
Or summers.

16:38.790 --> 16:41.350
Hey, did Talia
leave already?

16:41.400 --> 16:42.150
Yeah.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.566
Yeah,
I was just saying goodbye.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.090
You two seem to be
gettIng along

16:46.130 --> 16:47.529
a whole lot better these days.

16:50.070 --> 16:52.800
Uh, can you believe that Aria
might be in Savannah next year?

16:52.840 --> 16:55.035
We could have
our very own Southern belle.

16:56.410 --> 16:58.503
Aria got into SCAD?

16:58.550 --> 17:00.040
Oh.

17:00.080 --> 17:02.446
Um, yeah,
I thought you knew.

17:02.480 --> 17:05.142
She was really excited.

17:05.190 --> 17:06.509
( clears throat )

17:06.550 --> 17:08.552
I'll let you
get back to work.

17:11.860 --> 17:14.124
Isn't Talia's last name
Sandoval?

17:14.160 --> 17:16.128
Why does that say Mendoza
on her file?

17:16.160 --> 17:17.195
Huh.

17:17.230 --> 17:19.391
Maybe Mendoza's
her married name.

17:19.430 --> 17:21.261
Lot of people use their
maiden name professionally.

17:21.300 --> 17:23.700
Yeah.
Talia is not married.

17:25.510 --> 17:26.602
Yes, she is.

17:26.640 --> 17:30.303
She has her husband listed
under her emergency contact.

17:36.250 --> 17:37.581
( giggling )

17:40.120 --> 17:42.054
This is really great.

17:43.190 --> 17:44.623
But who's gonna see this?

17:44.660 --> 17:45.752
Those people.
Up there.

17:45.790 --> 17:47.155
The higher-ups.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.349
Catch.
What?

17:49.860 --> 17:51.418
Throwing things at people
on ladders?

17:51.470 --> 17:52.459
Not cool.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.304
I told you
I'm not an artist.

17:57.340 --> 17:58.864
We're not leaving
until you paint something.

17:58.910 --> 17:59.865
Anything.

17:59.910 --> 18:01.377
I could ruin it.

18:01.410 --> 18:03.549
That's a risk
I'm willing to take.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.518
Okay.

18:23.300 --> 18:24.460
Looks good.

18:24.500 --> 18:27.230
You cannot even see it
from down there.

18:30.240 --> 18:32.208
Okay.

18:32.240 --> 18:34.379
Picasso,
come take a look.

18:36.640 --> 18:38.471
( gasps )
Ho ho!

18:38.510 --> 18:40.239
All right.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.257
And let's see the damage.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.423
I'll clean up down here.

19:03.410 --> 19:05.401
( typing )

19:44.380 --> 19:45.677
SPENCER: Hey.

19:45.710 --> 19:48.440
What is this?

19:50.490 --> 19:51.889
You're smiling about this?

19:51.920 --> 19:52.989
You don't get to
smile about this.

19:53.020 --> 19:54.317
You told me
that you were hired

19:54.360 --> 19:55.588
to paint a mural at Hollis.

19:55.620 --> 19:57.724
I did not say "hired."
I was careful about that.

19:57.760 --> 19:59.580
You know what else
you didn't say? "Vandalism."

19:59.630 --> 20:01.222
If I told you the truth,
would you have come?

20:01.260 --> 20:02.955
No!
Of course not!

20:03.000 --> 20:04.695
Look,
I am all for protest art,

20:04.730 --> 20:05.958
but I'm not
for getting tricked

20:06.000 --> 20:07.365
into doing
something illegal.

20:07.400 --> 20:08.765
Spencer, hold on.

20:08.800 --> 20:09.767
Hold on.

20:09.800 --> 20:10.960
What?

20:11.010 --> 20:13.308
I'm sorry, okay?

20:13.340 --> 20:15.501
I-I wanted you to come.

20:15.540 --> 20:17.349
All this college
talk with your mom,

20:17.380 --> 20:20.247
I thought maybe
you'd enjoy coloring
outside the lines for once.

20:20.280 --> 20:22.441
For once?

20:22.480 --> 20:24.311
I was arrested, Jonny.

20:24.350 --> 20:25.442
For murder.

20:25.490 --> 20:27.378
And they dropped the charges,

20:27.420 --> 20:28.785
but I cannot mess up again,
okay?

20:28.820 --> 20:31.254
I can't be arrested again.

20:31.290 --> 20:32.723
I didn't know.

20:32.760 --> 20:35.297
Okay.
Well, now you do.

20:37.830 --> 20:40.833
( door opens, closes )

20:42.770 --> 20:44.465
What's next?

20:44.510 --> 20:47.729
Vectors and equilibrium,
or the French and Indian War?

20:47.780 --> 20:50.032
Aria?

20:50.080 --> 20:51.900
Oh. Sorry.

20:51.950 --> 20:54.942
I'm a little out of it.
I didn't get much sleep
last night.

20:54.980 --> 20:56.618
Is anything wrong?

20:56.650 --> 20:57.810
No. No, I'm fine.

20:57.850 --> 21:00.751
Uh...

21:00.790 --> 21:05.284
guess I should choose
what I'm worst at, right?

21:05.330 --> 21:07.696
I take it math and science
aren't Fitz's strong suit.

21:09.800 --> 21:11.028
Excuse me?

21:11.070 --> 21:13.664
I mean, you could always
ask him for help, right?

21:13.700 --> 21:15.668
Assuming you're
still together.

21:17.540 --> 21:20.429
Let's, um, let's just stick
to the books.

21:20.480 --> 21:24.041
Okay, so there are two types
of physical quantity.

21:24.080 --> 21:25.069
They are--

21:25.110 --> 21:27.977
( cell phone beeps )

21:31.090 --> 21:33.479
Vector and scalar.
That's correct.

21:34.690 --> 21:35.952
Sorry.

21:38.830 --> 21:39.956
( cell phone beeps )

21:41.960 --> 21:43.689
Which is your phone?

21:43.730 --> 21:45.095
Scalar?

21:45.130 --> 21:47.394
And if your phone were
to sail through the sky,

21:47.440 --> 21:49.692
accelerating at a rate of
3 miles per hour per second?

21:49.740 --> 21:52.300
Vector.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.744
Looks like someone's worried
about your brother.

22:05.790 --> 22:07.018
Come here.

22:07.050 --> 22:08.881
I have another table to bus.

22:08.920 --> 22:11.081
You have to try this.

22:11.130 --> 22:12.984
I'm really not hungry.

22:13.030 --> 22:15.624
Oh, come on.
There's always room for dessert.

22:17.000 --> 22:17.967
Come on, try it.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.695
No. I'm good.

22:19.730 --> 22:21.561
Emily. Hey.

22:21.600 --> 22:23.090
Are you okay?
What's wrong?

22:23.140 --> 22:26.837
You're married, Talia.
That's what's wrong.

22:26.870 --> 22:28.974
I saw your last name,
Mendoza,

22:29.010 --> 22:31.103
and it's the same
as your husband's.

22:31.150 --> 22:32.902
Were you ever gonna tell me?

22:32.950 --> 22:34.611
Yes.
VVhen?

22:36.750 --> 22:38.741
I don't understand.
Emily--

22:38.790 --> 22:40.849
I don't understand how you can
stand there all this time

22:40.890 --> 22:41.959
and not tell me this.

22:41.990 --> 22:44.049
How you can kiss me,
how you can tell me you like me

22:44.090 --> 22:45.751
and not tell me any of this.

22:45.790 --> 22:46.825
Emily--

22:51.900 --> 22:53.788
Is everything okay in here?

22:57.510 --> 23:00.604
I'll talk to Mae.
She'll set it up.

23:00.640 --> 23:01.902
Great seeing you, Alan.

23:09.180 --> 23:12.047
Hey, Dad.

23:58.970 --> 24:01.530
( laughing )
We good on time?

24:01.570 --> 24:03.458
I've got about an hour
till batting practice.

24:03.510 --> 24:04.932
Want to move on
to SpanIsh?

24:04.970 --> 24:08.929
Hmm. Baseball team,
Spanish group, decathlon--

24:08.980 --> 24:12.199
are there any school activities
you are not involved in?

24:12.250 --> 24:14.013
Well, compared
to your exciting life,

24:14.050 --> 24:15.210
mine must seem really--

24:15.250 --> 24:18.083
Functional? Healthy?

24:18.120 --> 24:20.111
Planned.

24:22.120 --> 24:24.554
( knocking on door)

24:24.590 --> 24:25.659
One sec.

24:29.160 --> 24:30.923
I need to talk to you
about Mike.

24:34.640 --> 24:35.834
Hey, Andrew.

24:35.870 --> 24:37.735
Hi, Emily.

24:37.770 --> 24:39.738
Okay.

24:41.880 --> 24:45.702
Where did Mike get
$18,000?

24:45.750 --> 24:49.618
Doesn't "A" always have access
to a ton of money?

24:49.650 --> 24:52.016
Maybe this is one of Ali's
secret accounts.

24:53.920 --> 24:55.057
Mike got a call last night

24:55.090 --> 24:56.717
from the women's
correctIonal faCIIIty.

24:56.760 --> 24:58.853
From Ali?
I think so.

24:58.890 --> 25:02.155
She called, said her name
was Hank Mahoney and hung up.

25:02.200 --> 25:03.895
I mean, it's got to be
some kind of code.

25:03.930 --> 25:06.728
And now he's got $400 burning
a hole in his pocket.

25:06.770 --> 25:10.262
( car door closes,
engine starts )

25:10.300 --> 25:11.267
Mike just took the car.

25:11.310 --> 25:12.265
We need to follow him.

25:12.310 --> 25:13.129
How?

25:13.170 --> 25:15.229
I am not riding
on your handlebars.

25:19.650 --> 25:21.277
Hey, Andrew.

25:21.320 --> 25:23.276
Can we borrow your car?

25:23.320 --> 25:25.584
Just for a little bit.

25:28.320 --> 25:30.117
Do either of you
drive a stick?

25:34.230 --> 25:37.563
Ballard, Skidmore,
and Trinity?

25:37.600 --> 25:39.795
Not bad, right?

25:39.830 --> 25:41.297
Not bad at all.

25:41.340 --> 25:43.900
You know which one
you want to go to?

25:43.940 --> 25:45.760
Not yet.

25:45.810 --> 25:48.779
I still have to figure out
how I'm gonna pay for it.

25:48.810 --> 25:52.576
That's sort of what I wanted
to talk to you about.

25:54.220 --> 25:57.314
Your mom and I
have an agreement In place.

25:57.350 --> 25:58.647
If she's got an issue--

25:58.690 --> 25:59.645
Well, she doesn't.

25:59.690 --> 26:01.988
I'm the one asking.

26:03.830 --> 26:07.049
Hanna, I'm so proud of you.

26:07.090 --> 26:09.923
I really am.

26:09.960 --> 26:13.669
But I didn't even know
that you wanted

26:13.700 --> 26:15.930
to go
to these types of schools.

26:15.970 --> 26:19.235
This is-- This kind of thing
takes planning.

26:20.710 --> 26:23.599
So what are you saying?

26:23.650 --> 26:26.676
I'm saying, $10,000 a year.

26:26.710 --> 26:28.849
That's what your mom and I
agreed on.

26:33.250 --> 26:36.708
Kate starts Dartmouth
in the fall

26:36.760 --> 26:40.218
and I cannot afford to put
two kids through private school.

26:40.260 --> 26:43.696
Hanna, it comes down
to dollars and cents,

26:43.730 --> 26:46.722
and I just don't have it.

26:47.870 --> 26:50.088
You're paying for Kate?

26:50.140 --> 26:54.236
Hanna, Kate worked hard
for this.

26:54.280 --> 26:55.304
She got early acceptance,

26:55.340 --> 26:57.103
and I have already
promised Isabel

26:57.140 --> 26:59.005
that I will take care of it.

27:00.280 --> 27:05.411
So Kate is going to Dartmouth,
and you're paying,

27:05.450 --> 27:07.918
and you didn't even ask me
where I applied.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.985
Last we talked about college,

27:10.020 --> 27:12.250
you said you'd rather spend
the money on a beach vacation

27:12.290 --> 27:13.257
and a good manicure.

27:13.290 --> 27:14.928
Last we talked about college,

27:14.960 --> 27:16.791
I was 12 years old
and obsessed with donuts.

27:16.830 --> 27:18.422
You'd never even
heard of Kate.

27:18.470 --> 27:20.859
Hanna, I want to help,
I just--

27:20.900 --> 27:24.404
You just--you don't want to
disappoint the wrong daughter.

27:24.440 --> 27:26.305
I get it.

27:42.060 --> 27:44.756
SPENCER: "I owe you much more
than an email...

27:44.790 --> 27:47.224
"especially this one.

27:47.260 --> 27:48.591
"I know it's a long shot,

27:48.630 --> 27:52.327
but any chance Wren still
has that contact at Oxford?"

27:56.840 --> 27:58.933
* There are days
when I wake up *

28:00.810 --> 28:03.199
* That I don't know
what I'm d0Ing here *

28:03.240 --> 28:05.447
( cell phone beeps )

28:05.480 --> 28:12.181
* I barely recognize the pair
of eyes staring back at me *

28:12.220 --> 28:14.211
Spencer says
she'll meet us there.

28:14.260 --> 28:15.249
Left.

28:15.290 --> 28:17.929
He's turning left.

28:17.960 --> 28:20.451
Do you often follow
your brother places?

28:20.490 --> 28:22.219
Not usually.

28:22.260 --> 28:24.262
And you have no idea
where we're going?

28:24.300 --> 28:26.860
Um, I'm sure it's close.

28:29.240 --> 28:31.834
What exactly
is going on with Mike?

28:33.510 --> 28:36.479
Drugs.
ANDREW: Drugs?

28:36.510 --> 28:40.378
You know, like stimulants,
amphetamines.

28:40.410 --> 28:42.412
Yeah, we think
he might be dabbling.

28:42.450 --> 28:43.986
Really?

28:45.120 --> 28:46.382
Yep.
( cell phone beeps )

28:46.420 --> 28:48.388
Okay, well,
no word from Hanna,

28:48.420 --> 28:49.853
but Spencer's getting
on the highway.

28:49.890 --> 28:52.256
So I'll just text her
when we get...

28:52.290 --> 28:54.099
uh...

28:54.130 --> 28:55.757
get to where we're going.

29:00.030 --> 29:01.531
Thank you so much
for the ride.

29:01.570 --> 29:02.867
Should I come in with you?

29:02.900 --> 29:04.231
No, no.
We've got it from here.

29:04.270 --> 29:05.828
How are you getting home?

29:05.870 --> 29:07.132
Spencer can give us a ride.
Yeah.

29:07.170 --> 29:08.273
And if you leave right now,

29:08.310 --> 29:10.471
you could still make the end
of your batting practice.

29:17.180 --> 29:20.479
Drugs?
Seriously, Em?

29:22.590 --> 29:25.787
( country rock
playing on jukebox)

29:26.890 --> 29:30.929
( indistinct chatter )

29:47.310 --> 29:48.572
I'm Mike.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.417
Hank.

29:50.450 --> 29:52.338
That's Hank Mahoney?

29:52.390 --> 29:55.814
No.
That's Cyrus Petrillo.

29:55.860 --> 29:57.782
Ali's fake kidnapper.

30:15.340 --> 30:17.069
Hanna?
Are you okay?

30:17.110 --> 30:18.099
Where's Emily?

30:18.150 --> 30:19.503
She left early.
What's going on?

30:19.550 --> 30:20.369
Nothing.

30:20.410 --> 30:22.310
I just left my phone
at my dad's office

30:22.350 --> 30:24.215
and I can't reach anyone.

30:24.250 --> 30:25.319
And you can't go back
and get it?

30:25.350 --> 30:28.911
No, I can't.
I cannot go back there.

30:28.960 --> 30:31.178
Okay, well, look, you don't have
to tell me anything,

30:31.230 --> 30:33.949
but...you can if you want to.

30:45.240 --> 30:47.458
My dad doesn't think
that I'm college material.

30:47.510 --> 30:50.331
He thinks Kate is, not me.

30:50.380 --> 30:53.941
And he never thought that I'd go
to a good school, and now,

30:53.980 --> 30:56.073
because of him,
I might not get to.

30:56.120 --> 30:57.075
Sorry, who is Kate?

30:57.120 --> 30:59.338
My stepsister.

30:59.390 --> 31:02.484
My stupid,
perfect stepsister.

31:02.520 --> 31:05.648
You know, I wanted him
to help pay for school,

31:05.690 --> 31:07.351
but you know
what I wanted more than that,

31:07.390 --> 31:10.553
was for him to just look
at me once and say,

31:10.600 --> 31:12.864
"I knew that you had it
in you."

31:15.140 --> 31:16.437
When I was in high school,

31:16.470 --> 31:18.506
my parents couldn't agree
on a single thing

31:18.540 --> 31:21.976
except for the fact that
I wouldn't amount to much.

31:22.010 --> 31:24.171
And what happened?

31:24.210 --> 31:25.279
Once they cut me off

31:25.310 --> 31:27.175
and I realized
that I was on my own,

31:27.210 --> 31:29.519
I took out
a bunch of loans,

31:29.550 --> 31:31.916
I applied to every job
that I could,

31:31.950 --> 31:33.417
no matter how ridiculous,

31:33.450 --> 31:37.113
and I paid my way
through school by myself.

31:37.160 --> 31:38.980
You know, those guys
that stand outside

31:39.030 --> 31:41.328
with the hot dog uniforms
in 90 degree heat?

31:41.360 --> 31:42.588
You were a hot dog?

31:42.630 --> 31:45.326
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I was
the best damn hot dog.

31:50.170 --> 31:53.003
I know this isn't the same.

31:53.040 --> 31:55.133
But I used
to be your teacher,

31:55.180 --> 31:57.432
and I always knew
that you had it in you.

32:02.380 --> 32:04.587
I'm so sorry, guys.
I got here as fast as I could.

32:08.320 --> 32:09.412
What do we know?
Anything?

32:09.460 --> 32:12.429
We think Mike brought
Cyrus money. $400.

32:12.460 --> 32:14.599
We tried to get close,
but they almost saw us.

32:14.630 --> 32:16.222
And that message
that All sent from jail,

32:16.260 --> 32:18.364
that was her way of telling
Mike Cyrus's new name?

32:18.400 --> 32:19.560
Yes, so Mike could find him.

32:19.600 --> 32:21.295
That's what we think aanay.

32:21.340 --> 32:23.296
So he's here _
on an errand from All?

32:23.340 --> 32:26.309
I mean, is it just me,
or is she even scarier
behInd bars?

32:26.340 --> 32:28.228
Look, Cyrus, Hank,
whoever this guy is,

32:28.280 --> 32:30.703
he's really dangerous
and he's talking to my brother.

32:30.740 --> 32:33.573
So I-I don't care
if Mike is working for Ali.

32:33.610 --> 32:34.713
I'm not gonna let him get hurt.

32:34.750 --> 32:35.546
So we should just--

32:35.580 --> 32:38.447
Aria, stop. Hey.
You cannot do that.

32:38.490 --> 32:40.617
Look, I know that you're
really worried about Mike,

32:40.650 --> 32:42.049
but as soon _
as they leave the dIner,

32:42.090 --> 32:43.318
we're gonna follow Cyrus
and we'll find out

32:43.360 --> 32:45.089
where he's going
and what he knows.

32:45.130 --> 32:47.451
If we go in there,
we won't know any more
than we know now.

32:47.490 --> 32:48.457
( cell phone rings )

32:48.500 --> 32:50.058
Shut it off. Shut it off.

32:50.100 --> 32:51.362
Okay.

33:01.110 --> 33:03.738
(sighs)
Straight to voicemail.

33:03.780 --> 33:06.544
Oh. Um...

33:06.580 --> 33:10.141
Well, do you want
to call somebody else?
I have Emily's number.

33:10.180 --> 33:13.411
No, it's fine.
I'm just gonna head home.
Okay.

33:13.450 --> 33:17.682
Thank you for the image of you
in a hot dog costume.

33:17.720 --> 33:19.756
And everything else
that you said.

33:19.790 --> 33:21.997
Yeah, anytime.

33:39.410 --> 33:41.241
I told Ezra about Savannah.

33:41.280 --> 33:43.578
I thought he knew.

33:43.620 --> 33:45.781
Yeah.
I should've told him already.

33:45.820 --> 33:48.812
Why didn't you?
You guys fighting?

33:48.860 --> 33:52.387
I don't know
what we are, honestly.

33:52.430 --> 33:54.057
I mean, he thinks
he's the reason

33:54.100 --> 33:56.591
that I didn't have this perfect
high school experience.

33:56.630 --> 33:58.598
Is that even a thing?
Does anyone have that?

33:58.630 --> 34:00.689
I don't know.

34:00.730 --> 34:04.131
God, Em, I know you must be
missing Paige right now,

34:04.170 --> 34:08.174
but at least your love life
isn't full-on confusing.

34:09.210 --> 34:13.146
( cell phones ring )

34:13.180 --> 34:15.410
"Thanks for donating
to my get-into—jail fund.

34:15.450 --> 34:18.112
"A. ll
ARIA:
What?

34:19.720 --> 34:21.039
Guys.

34:28.460 --> 34:31.429
The envelope.
It wasn't money.

34:31.470 --> 34:33.267
( car starts )

34:39.210 --> 34:40.563
Where's Cyrus?
Was he with Mike?

34:40.610 --> 34:42.168
I don't know.

34:42.210 --> 34:43.734
( motorcycle approaches )

34:45.880 --> 34:47.347
( rewing engine )

34:59.360 --> 35:02.249
So you here to watch
the kid or me?

35:02.300 --> 35:03.358
Hmm?

35:04.900 --> 35:07.323
'Cause to be honest,
I don't like being followed.

35:07.370 --> 35:09.497
You have something
that belongs to us.

35:11.640 --> 35:12.902
Do I?

35:12.940 --> 35:14.828
Yeah.
We just want it back.

35:15.910 --> 35:18.777
Maybe we could
work out a trade.

35:18.810 --> 35:22.348
ANDREW: Back away from them.

35:22.380 --> 35:24.382
Now.

35:28.690 --> 35:30.885
( chuckles )

35:30.920 --> 35:32.251
Hmmm.

35:36.460 --> 35:38.519
You guys okay?

35:52.680 --> 35:55.717
You went to see your dad.

35:56.980 --> 35:58.618
Did he drop it off?

36:02.560 --> 36:04.380
I'm sorry I went.

36:04.430 --> 36:06.785
Believe me, I am.

36:06.830 --> 36:10.288
And I didn't mention
anything about your job.

36:12.470 --> 36:14.392
Let me guess.

36:14.440 --> 36:17.295
He said it all comes down
to dollars and cents.

36:23.710 --> 36:27.749
I know your dad
can be...dismissive.

36:27.780 --> 36:29.543
But please tell me
you're not looking

36:29.580 --> 36:31.889
_ for validation
In a beauty pageant.

36:31.920 --> 36:33.842
I'm not.

36:33.890 --> 36:36.552
The winner gets
a $20,000 scholarship.

36:36.590 --> 36:38.854
We're gonna have to pay
for my tuition somehow.

36:40.390 --> 36:42.620
Did Ted call?

36:42.660 --> 36:43.752
No.

36:43.800 --> 36:45.392
And I don't think
he's going to.

36:46.670 --> 36:48.331
So that's it?

36:50.040 --> 36:51.359
Hanna--

36:51.410 --> 36:53.560
Mom. You love him.

36:53.610 --> 36:55.430
You can't just give up
like that.

36:55.480 --> 36:58.574
It's not just my decision.

36:58.610 --> 37:01.477
Well, he's hurt,
and you have to fight for him.

37:01.520 --> 37:02.475
I'm serious.

37:02.520 --> 37:05.444
IfI can put myself
in this beauty pageant,

37:05.490 --> 37:07.708
then you can call the man
that you love

37:07.750 --> 37:08.853
and want to spend
the rest of your life with

37:08.890 --> 37:10.983
and tell him
to take you back.

37:11.020 --> 37:14.899
Here, you can even use
my phone.

37:31.380 --> 37:32.699
( cell phone beeps )

37:44.060 --> 37:45.789
( cell phone beeps )

38:02.940 --> 38:04.271
( car door closes )

38:08.480 --> 38:09.947
Please?

38:19.490 --> 38:20.650
Hey.

38:20.690 --> 38:22.396
I'll be out of your hair
in a minute.

38:22.430 --> 38:24.819
Um, I'll--
I'll be right upstairs, okay?

38:28.840 --> 38:33.402
Okay, look, I talked to my mom
and she informed me

38:33.440 --> 38:35.670
that she would never ever buy
frozen mac 'n' cheese

38:35.710 --> 38:37.678
or anything that started
with the word "zesty".

38:37.710 --> 38:39.575
So I'm really sorry

38:39.610 --> 38:41.419
that I've been eating
all of your food.

38:41.450 --> 38:44.078
Uh, no worries.

38:44.120 --> 38:47.886
And also, you were right,
by the way.

38:47.920 --> 38:49.683
I did have fun last night.

38:49.720 --> 38:52.587
But I also have boundaries.

38:52.630 --> 38:54.951
And getting to go to college
is maybe my best chance

38:55.000 --> 38:56.422
of getting out of this town.

38:56.460 --> 38:58.098
So I really
don't want to ruin it.

38:58.130 --> 39:00.428
I get it. I do.

39:00.470 --> 39:04.634
Believe it or not,
I have boundaries, too.

39:04.670 --> 39:05.705
Really?

39:05.740 --> 39:08.903
At least I'm trying to.

39:11.610 --> 39:12.838
Good night.

39:12.880 --> 39:14.745
Okay. Good night.

39:17.680 --> 39:20.786
Eric and I started dating
in 9th grade.

39:20.820 --> 39:23.482
We were married
right after high school.

39:23.520 --> 39:24.521
We loved each other,

39:24.560 --> 39:27.723
but we barely
even knew ourselves.

39:27.760 --> 39:33.062
We still love each other,
but it's not romantic.

39:33.100 --> 39:36.035
He knows
I'm attracted to women.

39:36.070 --> 39:40.029
He knows that I have
to be true to myself.

39:41.910 --> 39:45.607
Then why stay with him?

39:45.650 --> 39:48.005
Because he's my best friend.

39:48.050 --> 39:52.510
Because he has been with me
through everything.

39:55.590 --> 39:57.387
I know this is complicated.

39:58.990 --> 40:01.049
No one wants complicated.

40:02.960 --> 40:07.693
I'm beginning to think that
there's no such thing
as simple.

40:07.730 --> 40:10.039
I shouldn't have
lied to you.

40:10.070 --> 40:12.766
I just didn't want
to scare you away.

40:12.810 --> 40:15.529
I know how it all sounds
when I say it out loud.

40:16.680 --> 40:19.103
I'm sorry, Emily.

40:21.210 --> 40:23.815
I just wanted to tell you
that in person.

40:26.990 --> 40:29.652
Remember...

40:29.690 --> 40:32.523
when you asked me
what my biggest fear was?

40:32.560 --> 40:35.529
Y-Yeah.

40:35.560 --> 40:38.825
There are things I'm not ready
to share with you either.

40:41.100 --> 40:44.467
Things that would scare you
away from me.

40:45.710 --> 40:48.975
That is very hard to believe.

41:10.130 --> 41:12.826
We just filled
my overnight bag and ran.

41:12.870 --> 41:16.237
Was the car back?
No. Not yet.

41:16.270 --> 41:19.762
Thanks.
So glad you're staying
here tonight.

41:19.810 --> 41:22.699
It was bad enough when Mike
was stealing Jenna's pottery.
Now this?

41:22.740 --> 41:24.105
This is our blood.

41:24.140 --> 41:26.040
ARIA: Well, what do we do now?

41:26.080 --> 41:29.140
We just wait until "A" paints
the town red in our DNA?

41:29.180 --> 41:31.114
I don't know.

41:31.150 --> 41:34.187
One drop here,
one spot there, and kaboom,

41:34.220 --> 41:36.609
we're all sharing
a jail cell with Ali.

41:36.660 --> 41:39.879
You are, like,
the queen of not helping.

41:39.930 --> 41:43.593
See? There's a reason
I'm afraId of needles.

41:43.630 --> 41:46.497
We should've all spent
the summer in Haiti.

41:54.780 --> 41:56.805
I'm gonna go get us
another blanket.

42:17.360 --> 42:19.123
CALEB: What are you gonna do
with all the stuff in the bin?

42:19.170 --> 42:22.162
HANNA: We'll burn the clothes
and personal items.
CALEB: And the barrel?

42:22.200 --> 42:23.462
HANNA: We'll roll it
into the woods,

42:23.500 --> 42:26.207
and then we'll call the police
from a burner phone.

42:26.240 --> 42:29.038
CALEB:
We'll never pull this off.
HANNA: Yes, we will.

42:29.080 --> 42:31.036
I found a drill bit
that can break the lock.

42:31.080 --> 42:34.174
And I already rented
a van and a dolly.

42:34.210 --> 42:35.973
CALEB: What are you gonna do
with all the stuff in the bin?

42:36.020 --> 42:38.818
HANNA: We'll burn the clothes
and personal items.
CALEB: And the barrel?

42:38.850 --> 42:40.112
HANNA: We'll roll it
into the woods,

42:40.150 --> 42:42.857
and then we'll call the police
from a burner phone.

42:42.890 --> 42:45.723
CALEB:
We'll never pull this off.
HANNA: Yes, we will....
