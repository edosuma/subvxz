♪♪

00:20.250 --> 00:21.670
Goin' somewhere?

00:21.670 --> 00:23.540
Oh, uh, ...

00:23.540 --> 00:25.670
I like to get
the flood flowing
before class.

00:25.670 --> 00:28.420
Yeah, at first I thought
you didn't want
to sit next to me.

00:28.420 --> 00:30.460
Like maybe you were embarrassed
about losing your cool

00:30.460 --> 00:32.120
and recruiting
an entire army of children

00:32.120 --> 00:33.540
to knock down
your own fence.

00:33.540 --> 00:35.540
I'm not looking
for an argument, Aidan.

00:35.540 --> 00:37.250
Let's just keep a safe distance
from each other

00:37.250 --> 00:38.380
until graduation.

00:38.380 --> 00:39.710
Graduation?!

00:39.710 --> 00:41.540
Someone's an underachiever.

00:41.540 --> 00:43.290
I'm shootin' for forever.

00:47.250 --> 00:49.460
- Pop quiz.

00:49.460 --> 00:51.960
What?! Miss Wilson
didn't tell us
we had a quiz.

00:51.960 --> 00:53.620
I believe
that's the "pop" part.

00:53.620 --> 00:57.290
But what do I know?
I'm just an underachiever.

00:57.290 --> 00:59.920
I know I'm better than this,
but I'm not gonna lie--

00:59.920 --> 01:01.670
it's fun to watch him suffer.

01:11.170 --> 01:12.460
Do you mind?

01:12.460 --> 01:14.620
Helps me concentrate.

01:14.620 --> 01:16.210
Well, it does
the opposite for me.

01:16.210 --> 01:19.460
Great. Now we know
where everyone stands.

01:24.380 --> 01:26.330
I don't know
which bugs me more--

01:26.330 --> 01:28.120
his fingers or his face.

01:28.120 --> 01:30.120
Fingers, face. Fingers, face.

01:30.120 --> 01:31.420
Fingers, face.

01:33.120 --> 01:35.120
Honestly, it's a toss-up.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.460
It's impossible
to avoid this guy.

01:37.460 --> 01:39.080
I'm an inventor, though.

01:39.080 --> 01:41.000
I should be able
to figure this out.

01:46.460 --> 01:49.170
No, a fence
is what started
all of this.

01:49.170 --> 01:50.710
Oh! How about...

01:50.710 --> 01:55.460
- Good-bye, drummer boy!

01:55.460 --> 01:58.120
Eh, he'll just come back
when the batteries die.

01:58.120 --> 02:01.580
Maybe... teleportation!
Send him to Mars!

02:01.580 --> 02:04.420
Wait. I want to be
the first person on Mars.

02:04.420 --> 02:06.120
Better send him to Venus.

02:08.540 --> 02:10.500
It's 800 degrees there--

02:10.500 --> 02:12.170
a perfect fit
for all his hot air.

02:12.170 --> 02:13.830
Hot air.

02:13.830 --> 02:16.250
Hey, Miss Wilson
said pencils down.

02:16.250 --> 02:18.540
Wilson said what?

02:18.540 --> 02:21.380
I didn't finish.
I didn't even start.

02:21.380 --> 02:23.210
You should try drumming.

02:23.210 --> 02:25.210
Helps you focus.

02:27.620 --> 02:29.620
Coming for my backyard
is bad enough,

02:29.620 --> 02:32.420
but messing with my grades?
Too far.

02:32.420 --> 02:34.920
I'm at least three years away
from inventing a teleporter,

02:34.920 --> 02:36.830
but when I do, forget Venus--

who will win the epic battle

Will you be able to sleep

03:47.250 --> 03:49.580
I know I won't.

03:49.580 --> 03:52.330
Breaking election results
right here during
Friday's announcements.

03:52.330 --> 03:54.620
This was Harley on the mic.
Thanks for listening.

03:54.620 --> 03:56.670
Not that you have a choice--

03:56.670 --> 03:58.250
I'm playing through
all the speakers in the school.

04:01.080 --> 04:04.670
Oh, hi. Thanks for waiting
until the "on air" light
went off this time.

04:04.670 --> 04:06.750
Uh, yeah. Well,
you learn fast

04:06.750 --> 04:08.540
after you've had
a mic thrown at your head.

04:08.540 --> 04:10.830
I woulda thrown these,
but it took me two days

04:10.830 --> 04:12.750
to get the bling just right.

04:12.750 --> 04:14.380
So...

04:14.380 --> 04:16.170
how about letting your BFTF

04:16.170 --> 04:17.920
get a peek at
the election results?

04:17.920 --> 04:20.170
I want to make a big bet
with the lunch lady.

04:20.170 --> 04:22.960
I'm talkin', like,
a whole week's worth
of potato tots.

04:22.960 --> 04:24.710
I'd hate to see Rosie
clean you out again.

04:24.710 --> 04:27.880
I'm sorry. The results are
kept in a sealed envelope.

04:27.880 --> 04:29.540
Ohh.

04:29.540 --> 04:31.750
Whoo! Scary doodle.

04:31.750 --> 04:35.170
- Who's the ugly dude
standing on the sun?
- It's Aidan.

04:35.170 --> 04:37.170
I'm still working
on his fangs and--

04:38.460 --> 04:40.210
Bake sale! Ohh!

04:40.210 --> 04:43.420
I'm not sure bake sale
goes with your whole
monster motif.

04:43.420 --> 04:45.830
No! I forgot to announce
the bake sale.

04:45.830 --> 04:48.620
I was too distracted
thinking about melting Aidan.

04:48.620 --> 04:50.210
He's in two of my classes.

04:50.210 --> 04:51.790
He's in my grade,

04:51.790 --> 04:54.170
and you have more classes
with him than I do.

04:54.170 --> 04:56.080
That's what you get
for being smart.

04:56.080 --> 04:58.080
I'm telling you,
this guy is so annoying,

04:58.080 --> 05:00.290
he's one drummity-drum
of the fingers away

05:00.290 --> 05:02.500
from landing on
the Dead to Diaz list.

05:02.500 --> 05:04.670
The Diaz kids have a tradition:

05:04.670 --> 05:07.670
We can each declare one person
Dead to Diaz,

05:07.670 --> 05:09.880
and then they're off-limits
to all of us.

05:09.880 --> 05:12.170
Lewie and Beast declared
their arch-rival twins,

05:12.170 --> 05:14.000
Poopie and Goon.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.040
Daphne declared her babysitter
that kept calling Daphne a doll,

05:17.040 --> 05:19.750
and Georgie declared
climate change.

05:19.750 --> 05:22.250
I'm not sure Georgie gets it.

05:22.250 --> 05:23.790
But you're the middle kid.

05:23.790 --> 05:25.750
You get along with everyone!

05:25.750 --> 05:29.040
You're the only one
who's never had
a person on the list.

05:29.040 --> 05:32.250
Ach, you're right.
I am.

05:32.250 --> 05:35.790
Plus, there are more
constructive ways
to deal with this.

05:35.790 --> 05:38.250
Baseball hat
that smooshes his head,

05:38.250 --> 05:39.790
folding umbrella
made of dynamite--

05:39.790 --> 05:41.580
Boom!
Yes, that's a good one.

05:41.580 --> 05:44.580
Is it just me,
or have your inventions
taken a dark turn?

05:45.960 --> 05:47.790
Just problem solving, Mom.

05:47.790 --> 05:49.420
♪ Ding dong! ♪

05:49.420 --> 05:50.960
I was doing some cleanup

05:50.960 --> 05:53.620

your daughter started.

05:53.620 --> 05:55.000
Kudos on being
the sort of neighbor

05:55.000 --> 05:56.750
to make me utter
that sentence.

05:56.750 --> 05:58.960
Thanks! But it's really
a nine-person effort.

05:58.960 --> 06:01.290
Well, I hope we're still on
to supervise

06:01.290 --> 06:04.040
Harley and Aiden's
replanting by the fence
this afternoon?

06:04.040 --> 06:06.120
Yes, I'll be there
with bushes, mulch,

06:06.120 --> 06:07.710
and stern mom face.

06:07.710 --> 06:10.250
Well, it's never too late
to start parenting.

06:10.250 --> 06:12.330
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm hoping I can count on you

06:12.330 --> 06:14.750
to help with
the school bake sale
this week?

06:14.750 --> 06:17.380
Ooh, sorry, I'm really busy.

06:17.380 --> 06:20.710
I won't have time to make
my world-famous brownies.

06:20.710 --> 06:23.830
I'm selling my kale-licious
healthy milkshakes.

06:23.830 --> 06:26.580
Kids' health
is important to me, so...

06:26.580 --> 06:27.960
anyhoo,
see you in a bit.

06:27.960 --> 06:29.290
Can't wait!

06:33.290 --> 06:36.540
That woman is so annoying,
telemarketers hang up on  her.

06:36.540 --> 06:39.830
- Yup.
"Yup"?

06:39.830 --> 06:41.790
She drives you crazy.

06:41.790 --> 06:42.960
Not anymore.

06:42.960 --> 06:44.710
But Ms. Peters
is your Aidan.

06:44.710 --> 06:46.540
How'd you keep your cool?

06:46.540 --> 06:48.750
Lately, I've been
trying out a new technique.

06:48.750 --> 06:50.460
It's working great, huh?

06:50.460 --> 06:53.580
Yeah. You need to teach me
so I can use it with Aidan.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.580
I know I'm way beyond you
in science,

06:55.580 --> 06:57.960
but there are
still  some things
I can learn from you.

06:57.960 --> 07:01.750
Like how to ask for a favor
without insulting
the person you're asking?

07:01.750 --> 07:04.170
Sure. We'll pencil that in
for next week.

07:06.750 --> 07:07.750
Remember,

07:07.750 --> 07:09.000
we need a new hit show.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.120
What do people
like to watch? Drama.

07:12.120 --> 07:14.920
And there's nothing
more exciting than
the life-or-death drama

07:14.920 --> 07:17.170
of the people who work
on the high seas.

07:17.170 --> 07:18.750
What is this?

07:18.750 --> 07:21.330
Dad, we need you
to take us out on a boat

07:21.330 --> 07:23.420
directly into a huge storm.

07:23.420 --> 07:25.170
And we need a crew.

07:25.170 --> 07:26.960
Is there any employees
you wouldn't miss

07:26.960 --> 07:28.750
if they fell overboard?

07:28.750 --> 07:30.330
Yeah, I'm not gonna answer that
with a camera present.

07:30.330 --> 07:31.830
So what are you guys up to?

07:31.830 --> 07:34.330
We're doing our new show--
Vicious Fish.

07:34.330 --> 07:36.620
My channel's been
losing subscribers

07:36.620 --> 07:38.750
ever since these two
bailed on  Trash Twins.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.540
You've eaten one
chocolate-dipped
tuna sandwich,

07:40.540 --> 07:41.790
you've eaten 'em all.

07:41.790 --> 07:43.580
It was time to move on.

07:43.580 --> 07:45.920
We didn't want to be seen
as garbage eaters forever.

07:45.920 --> 07:48.120
Not professionally,
anyway.

07:48.120 --> 07:49.790
Sorry, but I'm docked
here at the store.

07:49.790 --> 07:51.290
Gotta rotate the chum.

07:51.290 --> 07:54.580
- A small setback.

07:54.580 --> 07:57.380
The water isn't the only place
for a deep sea show.

07:57.380 --> 07:59.540
I'm sure there's plenty
of life-or-death drama

07:59.540 --> 08:01.170
right here at the store.

08:02.920 --> 08:04.960
Vicious Fish!

08:04.960 --> 08:07.880
Drama next to the high seas!

08:07.880 --> 08:10.880
Every day the great men
and women who take to the sea

08:10.880 --> 08:14.000
come here first to prepare
for their hard-fought battles

08:14.000 --> 08:17.290
with the ocean's
most dangerous beasts.

08:20.290 --> 08:21.790
A post card?

08:24.170 --> 08:26.830
Maybe one last correspondence
with a loved one

08:26.830 --> 08:31.420
before he's torn to shreds
by a school of barracuda!

08:31.420 --> 08:33.500
Vicious!

08:33.500 --> 08:37.710
Will that licorice
be his last meal?

08:37.710 --> 08:39.380
Vicious!

08:39.380 --> 08:41.040
Local store owner Tom Diaz

08:41.040 --> 08:43.500
has been peddling harpoons
and shark bait

08:43.500 --> 08:45.960
for 18 dangerous years.

08:45.960 --> 08:49.420
- Tom's Bait and Bite.

08:49.420 --> 08:51.080
Whoa. That's a real problem.

08:51.080 --> 08:52.710
A real problem?

08:52.710 --> 08:54.880
No doubt a weary fisherman
has found himself

08:54.880 --> 08:56.670
trapped in the eye of the storm,

08:56.670 --> 08:59.920
at the mercy of Mother Nature.

08:59.920 --> 09:03.580
Well, if you're
out of meatball,
I'll go chicken parm.

09:03.580 --> 09:07.250
Man in crisis
makes a quick decision.

09:07.250 --> 09:10.000
That was a close one.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.500
Vicious!

09:13.460 --> 09:15.580
Vicious Fish!

09:17.830 --> 09:20.750
We can all agree
this stinks, right?

09:20.750 --> 09:22.210
Mm-hmm.

09:22.210 --> 09:24.960
So here's my secret
to handling Bethany.

09:25.880 --> 09:28.750
Whatever she says,
I agree.

09:28.750 --> 09:30.960
- Yes.

09:30.960 --> 09:33.290
Turns out, the quickest way
to end an argument

09:33.290 --> 09:35.500
is just to agree
with the other person.

09:35.500 --> 09:37.790
I finally realized
that's what your dad
does to me.

09:37.790 --> 09:41.920
So, now I say yes...
for no distress.

09:41.920 --> 09:43.790
I came up with that.

09:43.790 --> 09:46.000
Pretty snappy.
I could see that
on a T-shirt.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.750
Thanks! I had
another method I tried,

09:48.750 --> 09:50.250
but it wasn't as good.

09:50.250 --> 09:52.920
Bethany! Bethany! Bethany!

09:52.920 --> 09:54.830
Ooh!

09:54.830 --> 09:58.040
That explains why
our throw pillows
are so flat.

09:58.040 --> 09:59.750
Just try using my technique
on Aidan

09:59.750 --> 10:01.670
while you're working
on the fence.

10:01.670 --> 10:04.620
I don't know. There's so many
annoying things about him.

10:04.620 --> 10:06.920
He's self-centered,
it's always "me, me, me."

10:06.920 --> 10:09.290
He always corrects
whatever I say
like he knows better.

10:09.290 --> 10:12.500
Oh, and he does this obnoxious
drumming with his fingers.

10:14.750 --> 10:16.790
It's annoying, right?
You can see how it's annoying.

10:22.120 --> 10:23.750
Yeah, I'll try
your technique.

10:28.710 --> 10:31.250
It's gonna be
a lot of work

10:31.250 --> 10:33.290
fixing this fence we ruined,
huh, neighbor?

10:33.290 --> 10:36.960
"We"? Only one of us
had a tiny army
and a bike tank.

10:38.710 --> 10:41.080
Yeah. That's true.

10:41.080 --> 10:43.710
Guess I got
a little carried away.

10:45.500 --> 10:47.460
Whatever.

10:47.460 --> 10:49.540
As long as
there are no pop quizzes,
you should be fine.

10:49.540 --> 10:50.710
Right?

10:55.750 --> 10:57.460
You better take it.

10:57.460 --> 10:59.830
I'll never get through this
if weapons are an option.

11:04.710 --> 11:08.080
I... like the placement
of those shrubs.

11:08.080 --> 11:10.920
Well, actually,
these aren't shrubs.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.080
These are flowers.

11:12.080 --> 11:14.710
You can tell
from the... flowers.

11:14.710 --> 11:18.120
Yes.
You're right.

11:18.120 --> 11:19.420
I stand corrected.

11:21.920 --> 11:24.040
It's not like
I practice lacrosse
for no reason.

11:24.040 --> 11:25.960
I scored 32 goals last year.

11:25.960 --> 11:27.380
I was interviewed
in the local paper.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.170
I make a mean grilled cheese.

11:31.170 --> 11:32.210
Hmm!

11:32.210 --> 11:34.000
I lived in Italy
for a year.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.420
I changed the spark plugs
on my dad's car.

11:36.420 --> 11:38.960
I think I got
something in my eye.

11:38.960 --> 11:40.790
I. I. I.

11:40.790 --> 11:42.000
I. I. I. I. I. I.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Cool! Amazing. Wow.

11:47.420 --> 11:50.000
...just a precautionary
fumigation.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.540
That's all I'm suggesting.

11:51.540 --> 11:53.120
Yes! Yes.

11:53.120 --> 11:55.000
Needless to say,
I was named team M.V.P.

11:56.750 --> 11:59.210
- Yes!
- One year I scored 50.

11:59.210 --> 12:00.920
That's how I got my nickname.

12:00.920 --> 12:01.920
"Ace man."

12:01.920 --> 12:04.040
Ace man.

12:04.040 --> 12:04.920
Catchy.

12:07.460 --> 12:11.710
Wow, I didn't know
you had so many interesting
things to say about yourself.

12:11.710 --> 12:15.210
Good thought. More yogurt
in my diet  would be helpful.

12:15.210 --> 12:17.120
Yes. Interesting.

12:17.120 --> 12:18.380
You're  so right.

12:18.380 --> 12:21.290
Good point.
I do sound like that.

12:21.290 --> 12:25.250
Y'know, Suzy,
this afternoon has been
surprisingly enjoyable.

12:25.250 --> 12:27.040
Yes.

12:27.040 --> 12:29.380
Y'know,
this wasn't terrible.

12:29.380 --> 12:31.580
Yes, it wasn't.

12:34.380 --> 12:36.040
That was the day

12:36.040 --> 12:39.080
the red tide brought in...
beach snakes.

12:39.080 --> 12:41.170
Guys.

12:41.170 --> 12:42.790
Is that bait
from the store?

12:43.880 --> 12:45.750
Short answer: Yes.

12:47.170 --> 12:49.830
We're faking
a giant snake infestation.

12:49.830 --> 12:52.420
There's no drama here.
This place is boring.

12:52.420 --> 12:55.120
Yeah. We've been here all day

12:55.120 --> 12:56.790
and we haven't seen
a shark attack,

12:56.790 --> 13:00.290
a tidal wave, not even
one ghost of a dead fisherman.

13:00.290 --> 13:03.000
Well, I'm sorry I run
a not-very-interesting store

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
that paid for
your video equipment.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.250
No more filming here.

13:06.250 --> 13:08.250
Tomorrow you guys
are Mom's problem.

13:10.460 --> 13:13.670
So, to recap,
we have no location,

13:13.670 --> 13:16.120
no storyline,
and a big mess to clean up.

13:16.120 --> 13:18.250
- Not "it"!
- Good luck with that.

13:18.250 --> 13:21.250
I can hear
the people unsubscribing

13:21.250 --> 13:23.120
from my channel right now.

13:23.120 --> 13:26.120
"Yes for no distress"
really worked.

13:26.120 --> 13:30.040
If I could get through
three hours of "I, I, I,
tappity-tap-tap,"

13:30.040 --> 13:32.250
I think I can handle Aidan
at school.

13:32.250 --> 13:34.290
You've inspired me.

13:34.290 --> 13:36.920
I'm gonna volunteer
at that bake sale Bethany's
been hounding me about.

13:36.920 --> 13:38.920
Ooh, are you gonna make
your famous homemade brownies?

13:38.920 --> 13:40.960
- Yes. Are you
gonna help me?
- No.

13:40.960 --> 13:43.710
Sorry, Mom, I gotta save
my yeses for tomorrow.

13:49.250 --> 13:51.830
We're Internet failures.

13:51.830 --> 13:54.710
A cake pop.
- Mm-hmm.

13:54.710 --> 13:57.330
Aw. Here's a dollar
for your pain.

13:57.330 --> 14:00.670
For both of us?
Take it.

14:00.670 --> 14:03.250
People give a discount
on damaged goods.

14:03.250 --> 14:05.830
We squeeze a few cookies,
we eat like kings!

14:05.830 --> 14:06.960
Let's go!

14:08.920 --> 14:11.290
Check it! Perfect store
on my quiz.

14:11.290 --> 14:13.750
I yessed my way
into ignoring Aidan.

14:13.750 --> 14:17.210
Look at us. I'm baking,
and you're sizzling.

14:17.210 --> 14:19.330
I'm back to
getting along
with everyone.

14:19.330 --> 14:21.500
Love to chat, but I'm gonna
have to go announce
the election results.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.040
I've been practicing.

14:23.040 --> 14:25.290
"And the winner is Steve!"

14:25.290 --> 14:28.330
"And the winner is Geneva!"

14:28.330 --> 14:30.960
I hope Geneva wins. Her name
is way more fun to say.

14:32.040 --> 14:34.040
Genevah!

14:37.920 --> 14:39.380
Hey.

14:39.380 --> 14:42.120
I de-blinged these.

14:42.120 --> 14:44.540
I know no one can see me
while I'm doing these
announcements,

14:44.540 --> 14:46.500
but they made me look dumb.

14:56.710 --> 14:58.330
I do the announcements.
This is my booth!

14:58.330 --> 14:59.750
Actually, it's the school's.

14:59.750 --> 15:01.250
No, it's--

15:02.330 --> 15:05.250
Yes.
Of course.

15:05.250 --> 15:08.080
I just meant I designed it
and put it together,

15:08.080 --> 15:10.330
so it's my thing.

15:10.330 --> 15:14.380
Well, Principal Kramer's
thing is getting
the new kid involved.

15:14.380 --> 15:17.330
And I used
to do announcements
at my old school.

15:17.330 --> 15:21.790
So here I am,
doing my thing.

15:21.790 --> 15:24.420
Aaaah!

15:24.420 --> 15:26.880
Sorry you had to see that.

15:26.880 --> 15:29.830
Look, now isn't
the best time to start.

15:29.830 --> 15:32.210
Today is the biggest
announcement of the year--

15:32.210 --> 15:33.420
class election results.

15:33.420 --> 15:35.670
I've been prepping for weeks.

15:35.670 --> 15:37.620
I've got sound effects,
trivia,

15:37.620 --> 15:40.460
and then...I hit 'em
with the big reveal.

15:40.460 --> 15:43.710
So are you saying
that I can't do
the announcements?

15:43.710 --> 15:45.420
I wouldn't say no.

15:45.420 --> 15:47.790
Yes! You can read
some of them.

15:47.790 --> 15:49.500
Ooh! Here's the lunch menu.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.380
Salisbury steak is back!

15:51.380 --> 15:53.460
Real crowd pleaser.

15:54.460 --> 15:56.670
Go on. Just go now.

15:56.670 --> 15:58.250
Move over here. Thanks.

16:02.460 --> 16:04.880
Hey! What are  you
feeling today?

16:04.880 --> 16:07.250
Peanut butter
or chocolate chip?

16:07.250 --> 16:09.290
Hmm, chocolate chip.

16:15.710 --> 16:20.330
Sir, this cookie's defective.
Here's a nickel.

16:22.500 --> 16:24.080
Healthy and delicious.

16:24.080 --> 16:25.330
Hang on.

16:25.330 --> 16:27.330
Just kale and soy milk.

16:27.330 --> 16:30.290
Mom and Ms. Peters
at a bake sale?

16:30.290 --> 16:33.460
Our search for drama
might not be dead just yet!

16:33.460 --> 16:35.290
You know, this has been
such a pleasant surprise.

16:35.290 --> 16:37.330
You actually showed up today,

16:37.330 --> 16:38.830
hooligans in tow.

16:38.830 --> 16:42.670
Yes.
Thanks for inviting me.

16:42.670 --> 16:45.710
And your kale-licious healthy
milkshakes look delicious.

16:45.710 --> 16:48.250
Oh, thanks.
So do your...

16:48.250 --> 16:50.880
Brownies. They're brownies.

16:50.880 --> 16:53.710
I'll give you
the benefit of the doubt.

16:55.920 --> 16:59.420
Get ready. They're smiling,
but their jaws are clenched.

16:59.420 --> 17:01.380
Just give it time.

17:01.380 --> 17:03.580
I'll cue you
when it's your turn.

17:03.580 --> 17:06.330
Honestly, I envy you.

17:06.330 --> 17:08.960
The lunch menu
is as important
as what I'm about to read.

17:08.960 --> 17:11.330
- And we're on the air.

17:11.330 --> 17:15.000
Hey, Marshport High,
it's Harley comin' atcha.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.960
We've got a great lineup
of announcements for you today,

17:17.960 --> 17:19.540
including the big one--

17:19.540 --> 17:22.380
the final result
of the student election.

17:22.380 --> 17:25.540
But first let's talk
about that crazy new
bus pickup schedule--

17:25.540 --> 17:28.580
Congrats, Geneva.
You won class president.

17:32.750 --> 17:34.170
We'll be right back.

17:35.380 --> 17:37.670
Why!

17:37.670 --> 17:40.290
You were going on and on.

17:40.290 --> 17:42.080
The people want the news  now.

17:43.540 --> 17:46.120
We're back,
and so is Salisbury steak.

17:46.120 --> 17:47.750
Make sure to tell
lunch lady Rosie

17:47.750 --> 17:49.580
that Ace Man sent you.

17:51.330 --> 17:53.580
What is the point
of being nice to you?!

17:53.580 --> 17:55.380
You seem mad.

17:55.380 --> 17:57.620
Wanna read
the rest of the lunch menu?

17:57.620 --> 17:59.330
Of  course I'm mad!

17:59.330 --> 18:01.920
I've been practicing
saying "Geneva!" for weeks!

18:01.920 --> 18:03.710
And I even practiced
saying "Steve,"

18:03.710 --> 18:05.790
even though we all knew
he never had a chance!

18:05.790 --> 18:08.540
You are the worst!
You are rude,

18:08.540 --> 18:09.750
self-centered,

18:09.750 --> 18:11.580
obnoxious, rude--

18:11.580 --> 18:13.210
Did I say "rude" twice?

18:13.210 --> 18:14.880
Yeah! That's because
you're twice as rude

18:14.880 --> 18:16.080
as anyone I've ever met!

18:16.080 --> 18:18.250
I can't believe my mom and I

18:18.250 --> 18:20.670
wasted time pretending
to be nice to you and your aunt

18:20.670 --> 18:22.620
so you guys would
stop driving us nuts!

18:22.620 --> 18:24.250
Do you think
she actually liked looking

18:24.250 --> 18:26.540
at Ms. Peters'
scrunched

18:26.540 --> 18:28.580
Her words, not mine!

18:28.580 --> 18:32.420
Uh, that was taken...
out of context.

18:32.420 --> 18:34.080
Kids, right?

18:34.080 --> 18:36.540
You were right.
It's paying off.

18:36.540 --> 18:38.000
Harley doesn't know
she's on air.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.960
I-I've gotta go tell her.

18:39.960 --> 18:41.620
- ...captain of
that pirate ship!

18:41.620 --> 18:44.830
Oh, but Ms. Peters
is about to flip the table!

18:44.830 --> 18:47.460
No. No, I've gotta go.
Keep filming.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.750
Everything
you do enrages me!

18:49.750 --> 18:52.040
...if I drive you so crazy,

18:52.040 --> 18:54.500
then why did you
show up here with
your way

18:54.500 --> 18:57.380
I am sick and tired
of your insults!

18:57.380 --> 19:00.330
My brownies are not dry.
They are delicious.

19:09.080 --> 19:11.420
Unhh!

19:12.380 --> 19:14.880
So good.

19:16.920 --> 19:20.120
Tears, fighting,
dry baked goods.

19:20.120 --> 19:22.750
It's  all here on
the Mad Housemoms of Marshport.

19:22.750 --> 19:25.380
...and what bugs me the most
is the drumming,

19:25.380 --> 19:27.670
the drumming on the bench,
drumming on the bench,

19:27.670 --> 19:29.540
drum, drum, drum, drum,
drum, drum, drum, drum,

19:29.540 --> 19:31.580
drum, drum, drum, drum,
drum, drum, drum, drum!

19:31.580 --> 19:33.460
You're not the only person
on the planet!

19:33.460 --> 19:37.170
Let's watch as this bake sale
turns into a bake fail.

19:37.170 --> 19:39.920
What point are you even
trying to make right now?

19:39.920 --> 19:41.710
Best. Brownies. Ever!

19:46.420 --> 19:48.420
What are you looking at?!

19:49.540 --> 19:51.540
This is what sugar does.

19:51.540 --> 19:53.670
...drum, drum, drum, drum,
drum, drum, drum, drum, drum--

19:53.670 --> 19:54.750
You're on air!

20:03.040 --> 20:04.580
And finally,

20:04.580 --> 20:06.750
the late bus will be leaving
at 4:15 today.

20:06.750 --> 20:07.880
Thank you.

20:13.460 --> 20:15.170
What are you looking at?!

20:15.170 --> 20:18.670
You want a kale-licious
milkshake? Nobody wants that.

20:18.670 --> 20:20.830
Best brownies here!

20:20.830 --> 20:23.540
The Mad Housemoms
of Marshport.

20:23.540 --> 20:26.120
- Delicious!

20:26.120 --> 20:28.790
I'm not a big fan of reality,
but  this I would watch.

20:28.790 --> 20:31.460
Wait long enough
and this family
always delivers.

20:31.460 --> 20:33.830
Executive producer Beast.

20:33.830 --> 20:35.710
I like the sound of  that.

20:35.710 --> 20:38.120
I'm sorry I lost it today.

20:38.120 --> 20:40.750
I guess I haven't quite
nailed down that technique.

20:40.750 --> 20:42.540
I know the feeling.

20:42.540 --> 20:44.750
I broadcast a total meltdown
in front of the whole school.

20:44.750 --> 20:48.750
Well, I got on the bus
at 4:15, so... win?

20:48.750 --> 20:51.250
Getting along
with difficult people
isn't easy.

20:51.250 --> 20:54.460
I guess we could both use
some more practice.

20:54.460 --> 20:56.080
You know what'll
make you feel better?

20:56.080 --> 20:59.620
Topping off those brownies
with some more pizza.

20:59.620 --> 21:02.580
Not sure it will,
but I'm willing to try.

21:06.500 --> 21:09.380
It's time to put Aidan
on the Dead To Diaz list.

21:09.380 --> 21:13.790
As much as I want to,
I've never put anyone
on that list before,

21:13.790 --> 21:16.330
and I'm not gonna start now.

21:16.330 --> 21:18.000
I don't want
to be that person.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.210
Well, I don't mind
being that person.

21:20.210 --> 21:24.210
Anyone who treats my BFTF
like that is dead to us.

21:24.210 --> 21:26.080
So, what do you say, guys?

21:26.080 --> 21:28.580
Aidan

21:28.580 --> 21:30.330
Hear, hear!

21:30.330 --> 21:32.380
- Cheers.
- Mm.

21:32.380 --> 21:34.790
Do I have an enemy
out there? Yes.

21:34.790 --> 21:37.170
Do I have my family
on my side? Yes.

21:37.170 --> 21:39.120
Can I coexist with Aidan?

21:39.120 --> 21:41.710
Not sure, but I'm going to try.

21:41.710 --> 21:43.750
After all, I'm an inventor.

21:43.750 --> 21:46.500
I should have stuck
to my strengths.

21:46.500 --> 21:48.880
Anti-Aidan ears.

21:48.880 --> 21:51.540
They cancel out
the specific frequency
of his voice

21:51.540 --> 21:54.040
so I can't hear him.

21:54.040 --> 21:56.790
...natural ability
for science.

21:56.790 --> 21:58.500
Yeah, after this semester

21:58.500 --> 22:00.500
they're gonna be calling me
the Ace Man

22:00.500 --> 22:02.120
for another reason.

22:02.120 --> 22:04.670
I always get good grades.
So good, in fact, that...

22:04.670 --> 22:06.080
With some people,

22:06.080 --> 22:08.250
hearing them out
is a solution.

22:08.250 --> 22:13.170
With Aidan, not hearing him
at all works best.
