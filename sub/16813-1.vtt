02:08.461 --> 02:10.547
No. No no!

02:14.593 --> 02:16.720
No, Trevor!

02:23.227 --> 02:25.187
Trevor, baby, no.

02:42.371 --> 02:44.373
Hello?

02:48.252 --> 02:50.254
Is someone there?

02:52.214 --> 02:54.216
Is someone in there?

02:56.718 --> 02:58.929
Is there someone
alive in there?

03:16.864 --> 03:18.907
Hey.

03:18.949 --> 03:19.950
Are you okay?

03:20.993 --> 03:23.203
Are you okay?

03:24.329 --> 03:26.373
I'm gonna get you
out of there.

03:28.959 --> 03:30.544
Hold on!

04:29.728 --> 04:32.606
What does it mean
to be happy?

04:35.025 --> 04:38.320
To be content
in the world around you?

04:42.199 --> 04:44.660
Mom used to say
it was family--

04:47.538 --> 04:51.333
That family is the heart
of everything, even existence.

04:51.375 --> 04:54.628
Without it, there's nothing.

04:58.549 --> 05:00.801
She would always have
these simple answers

05:00.843 --> 05:03.512
that somehow would sound
so brilliant.

05:07.599 --> 05:09.977
And then she died.

05:10.978 --> 05:13.939
My father died
along with her.

05:14.940 --> 05:18.026
Shortly after that, my brother David
had to sell the farm

05:18.068 --> 05:20.487
where we grew up.

05:22.614 --> 05:25.367
Now we're just trying to be
an ordinary family,

05:25.409 --> 05:29.454
trying to figure out
where we fit in in the world.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.502
And for me,

05:35.544 --> 05:37.921
I'm trying to figure out
where I belong,

05:37.963 --> 05:41.258
right now
in this exact moment.

05:41.884 --> 05:44.219
I don't know, Dad.
What do you think about the black hair?

05:47.973 --> 05:49.766
Come on, it's different.

05:49.808 --> 05:52.144
- It's different than normal.
- It's pretty, don't you think?

05:54.646 --> 05:57.065
Oh, yes.
Yes yes, definitely--

05:57.107 --> 05:58.901
right there, right there.

05:58.942 --> 06:01.028
Look at the baby,
he's part of the family.

06:01.069 --> 06:03.405
- Hey, there we go.
- Okay, Dad.

06:24.301 --> 06:26.136
I don't wanna hear that,
Darlene.

06:26.178 --> 06:28.055
The social worker
will be here tomorrow.

06:28.096 --> 06:29.973
We can't have the place
looking like this.

06:30.015 --> 06:33.727
- Whatever you say, Dad.
- That's not funny, Darlene.

06:33.769 --> 06:36.480
Okay, I'm trying to do
the best I can here.

06:36.522 --> 06:38.941
Oh, Jesus. You know, I'm not
a little girl anymore

06:38.982 --> 06:40.943
and you don't have to be
a dick about this!

06:40.984 --> 06:43.320
Just-- can you just please
clean your room

06:43.362 --> 06:46.114
and maybe not wear that mess
on your eyes tomorrow?

06:46.156 --> 06:48.116
Fuck you, David!

06:54.665 --> 06:57.417
Francis, turn it off now!

06:57.459 --> 07:00.087
Oh, come on, David,
it's a school project.

07:00.128 --> 07:02.297
- Just not our personal stuff, okay?
- It's about our family.

07:02.339 --> 07:05.008
- I need this kind of stuff.
- Turn it off now!

07:08.262 --> 07:11.390
You just get the heck
out of my face for a second.

07:15.227 --> 07:17.813
My brother David
is the oldest.

07:17.855 --> 07:21.817
He picked up all the responsibilities
after Mom and Dad died.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.279
We used to be real close,

07:26.822 --> 07:30.492
but after he sold our farm
something changed in him.

07:30.534 --> 07:34.496
He became like one of those life-sized
cardboard cutouts you see in the stores,

07:34.538 --> 07:38.959
trying to sell the idea
that everything is perfect,

07:40.210 --> 07:43.213
but really nothing
is the same anymore.

07:43.213 --> 07:45.424
We just keep moving
from town to town

07:45.465 --> 07:47.384
running from the truth,

07:47.384 --> 07:50.470
waiting for it to one day
catch up with us.

07:51.555 --> 07:54.516
This is our sixth house
in two years.

08:23.128 --> 08:25.214
Oh, yeah,
every single one of them.

08:26.256 --> 08:29.426
Wow, that's cool.

08:29.468 --> 08:31.553
Okay, guys,
I'm gonna go pee.

08:31.595 --> 08:33.931
- No, wait.
- I gotta go. No, come on.

08:33.931 --> 08:36.517
- Sam, stay.
- I'm gonna go. I'll be right back.

08:36.558 --> 08:40.270
- Don't take too long.
- I won't.

09:24.857 --> 09:29.027
Sam, get your ass in here
and smoke a joint.

09:29.069 --> 09:32.990
It's beautiful. Come on,
do the rain dance.

09:33.031 --> 09:35.492
Hell, no! Get in the car
right now, girl.

09:35.534 --> 09:37.995
Come on. No!

09:39.079 --> 09:42.624
- Yeah! Ow! Get in here.
- Come on!

09:42.666 --> 09:45.043
Back in.

09:46.879 --> 09:50.841
So, did you guys have fun?

09:50.841 --> 09:52.843
- Yeah.
- You are glowing.

09:52.843 --> 09:55.012
No, I'm not.

09:57.222 --> 10:01.059
So, Wendell,
what do you do?

10:02.853 --> 10:05.439
I work for my brother--

10:06.690 --> 10:09.318
fetch stuff for him,
things like that.

10:09.359 --> 10:13.780
- Nothing too exciting though.
- Sounds cool.

10:14.990 --> 10:18.285
So where are you guys off
to next, huh?

10:18.327 --> 10:20.787
Seattle, I think.

10:20.829 --> 10:23.457
We're just gonna keep traveling
city to city

10:23.498 --> 10:26.460
till we run all out of money.

10:27.461 --> 10:30.631
- Can't beat that kind of freedom.
- No, we just picked up and left!

10:30.672 --> 10:32.049
No one even knows
where we're at.

10:32.049 --> 10:34.301
- What?
- Hush.

10:34.343 --> 10:36.720
We don't have to worry
about Wendell, our hero.

10:36.762 --> 10:39.890
Wendell is Superman.

10:43.519 --> 10:46.813
Wow, look at that.

10:46.855 --> 10:49.149
Look at all
those pretty stars.

10:49.191 --> 10:52.861
- Where?
- I think you mean raindrops.

11:24.434 --> 11:27.062
You can at least pretend
to like it, okay?

11:30.440 --> 11:34.444
Hey, I'm sorry for yelling
at you yesterday.

11:34.486 --> 11:37.239
I didn't mean to.

11:37.281 --> 11:39.491
We're good?

11:39.533 --> 11:43.745
Yeah, we're good. But, David,
I'm really not feeling too hot today.

11:43.787 --> 11:46.456
- You're going to school, okay?
- I just don't think--

11:46.498 --> 11:48.417
I don't wanna hear it.
You're going to school.

11:48.458 --> 11:51.962
Good morning, sleepyhead.
You want some breakfast?

11:52.004 --> 11:54.631
Why do you even bother?

11:56.133 --> 11:59.678
Because that's what families do.
They have breakfast together.

11:59.720 --> 12:03.432
Cute, David. Anyway, Kitty's
spending the night tomorrow.

12:03.473 --> 12:05.809
- Who's uh--
- I am telling you in advance,

12:05.809 --> 12:08.604
- just like you asked.
- Who the heck is Kitty?

12:08.645 --> 12:11.356
I don't know,
some chick from Ohio.

12:11.398 --> 12:15.485
All right. Remember, social worker
is coming tonight at 5:00 for dinner.

12:19.156 --> 12:22.242
You should really try
giving up cooking, David.

12:25.829 --> 12:28.457
I'm off,
and you go to school.

12:28.498 --> 12:30.292
I really don't fit in there.

12:30.334 --> 12:32.294
Look,

12:34.505 --> 12:36.757
I know it's hard for you,

12:36.798 --> 12:38.926
but can you please
at least try?

12:38.967 --> 12:42.471
Why? It's not my fault
we're always moving.

12:42.513 --> 12:45.849
You're right, Francis.
It's my fault.

12:45.849 --> 12:48.602
I'm sorry, guys.

12:48.644 --> 12:52.231
I know I have a bad temper.
What do you want me to do?

12:53.482 --> 12:56.568
Some maybe say I'm bipolar.

12:56.610 --> 13:00.239
Good morning, Francis.
How are you doing there, bud, huh?

13:00.280 --> 13:02.282
What are you reading?

13:02.324 --> 13:05.994
"Gay sperm donors needed
for lesbian couple."

13:06.036 --> 13:08.997
- Knock it off.
- You're calling that today.

13:14.378 --> 13:17.297
- Have you fed Lenny?
- Don't look at me. Look at Franny.

13:17.339 --> 13:20.008
Oh, come on, I just did it
two days ago.

13:20.050 --> 13:22.177
Okay, I gotta go to work.

13:22.219 --> 13:26.473
- Will you just please do it?
- I'll do it before I go to school.

13:30.060 --> 13:33.939
Where're you going? Oh, yeah, you gotta
go do your thing. Forgot, sorry.

13:33.981 --> 13:36.692
Have fun.
Have a good day.

13:39.903 --> 13:44.408
The twins-- they've always
been distant from the family.

13:44.449 --> 13:47.744
Wendell is the main reason
why we move a lot.

13:47.786 --> 13:50.080
He just got out of jail for biting
some guy's ear off

13:50.122 --> 13:53.458
at a Cheesy Chuck's Pizza parlor
up north.

13:53.500 --> 13:57.004
Darlene is just as mean,
but more refined.

13:57.045 --> 14:00.048
Like when we were kids,
she used to lock me in the closet

14:00.090 --> 14:02.593
just to hear me scream.
Then, hours later,

14:02.634 --> 14:06.430
she would let me out pretending
she was the one who saved me.

14:06.471 --> 14:09.224
And I always fell for it.

14:58.315 --> 15:00.943
Let me out of here!

15:00.984 --> 15:04.112
Help, please!

15:33.851 --> 15:35.811
Please.

15:38.105 --> 15:42.317
Somebody please help us!

15:51.994 --> 15:55.747
Oh, heck no, we've had a lot
of social workers come here,

15:55.789 --> 15:58.041
but you're the first
for dinner.

15:58.083 --> 16:01.712
So, Francis, what's up
with you tonight, huh?

16:02.713 --> 16:05.299
- Nothing.
- Anything you wanna talk about?

16:05.340 --> 16:08.343
Anything at all? School maybe?
I don't know...

16:10.220 --> 16:13.891
Well, you know, if there is,
you just jump on in, all right?

16:13.932 --> 16:16.852
Yeah, he told me he wasn't
feeling too well this morning.

16:16.894 --> 16:19.021
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:19.062 --> 16:21.899
Oh, thank you, Darlene.

16:21.940 --> 16:24.568
That's, uh... quite a creative look

16:24.610 --> 16:27.112
you've got going there,
young lady.

16:27.154 --> 16:29.990
- What do you call that, huh?
- Death.

16:31.033 --> 16:34.661
Ah, death. That's cute.

16:35.746 --> 16:38.373
So tell me, David,
are you and Wendell

16:38.415 --> 16:42.544
still working over there
at Del Rancho?

16:42.586 --> 16:45.047
I don't know if I could work
at a slaughterhouse, huh?

16:45.088 --> 16:47.883
Yeah, well, my father
owned a farm

16:47.925 --> 16:50.552
when we were younger
and he did the same thing,

16:50.594 --> 16:53.055
so I guess it just
came naturally.

16:53.096 --> 16:55.057
Well...

16:56.099 --> 16:59.728
so, like, what do they have you
doing over there?

16:59.770 --> 17:01.730
I mean...

17:03.065 --> 17:06.944
you don't have to kill the animals
and all that stuff, do you, David?

17:06.944 --> 17:10.155
Heavens, no.
No no, I'm a carver.

17:10.196 --> 17:13.200
I take out the organs,
prep them, stuff like that.

17:13.242 --> 17:17.287
Yes, David has a real knack
for gutting the life out of things.

17:17.329 --> 17:19.414
Thank you, Darlene.

17:22.125 --> 17:24.962
So... too bad there's not--

17:25.002 --> 17:27.964
not a demand
on the black market for cow parts.

17:28.006 --> 17:31.593
You would be a rich man
by now.

17:31.635 --> 17:34.012
Not at the table,
please, Francis.

17:34.054 --> 17:38.433
I apologize. Paul, he's been
following us around with that thing

17:38.475 --> 17:41.687
for the past few days--
some sort of school project

17:41.728 --> 17:43.981
- or something or other.
- No, that's fine with me.

17:44.022 --> 17:48.026
I think it's kind of cool.
Francis, tell me about the project.

17:49.278 --> 17:52.656
Well, it's uh--

17:52.656 --> 17:57.119
I'm supposed to write
a report about my family--

17:57.160 --> 17:58.787
our family--

17:58.829 --> 18:03.417
and I just asked if I could
shoot a video instead.

18:03.458 --> 18:07.838
Good. Now, that's a good idea.
That is a great idea.

18:07.838 --> 18:09.923
- I hated doing papers. I hated it.
- Me too.

18:09.965 --> 18:11.633
I really did.

18:11.675 --> 18:13.886
- Hey, gang.
- Hey, Wendell.

18:13.927 --> 18:14.970
- Hey.
- How are you?

18:15.012 --> 18:18.140
- Good, Paul. How are you?
- Good, thanks.

18:18.182 --> 18:20.809
Am I late?

18:20.851 --> 18:23.312
What do you think,
Wendell?

18:23.353 --> 18:26.857
David,
may I please be excused?

18:26.899 --> 18:29.026
- We're not finished eating.
- No no no, let the boy go.

18:29.067 --> 18:30.819
- Mm-hmm.
- He's probably bored out of his mind.

18:30.861 --> 18:33.780
- Where are you going, Francis?
- I used to have two younger brothers,

18:33.822 --> 18:35.782
so I understand these things.

18:35.824 --> 18:38.368
They are a handful.

18:58.764 --> 19:02.226
That was great, you guys.
Thanks a lot.

19:02.267 --> 19:04.895
I know I'm not much
of a cook, but I do try.

19:04.937 --> 19:08.649
Not to worry. You probably never
tasted my wife's cooking, huh?

19:14.947 --> 19:19.076
Well, I'll be in the kitchen
cleaning.

19:26.291 --> 19:28.544
Did you hear that?

19:31.171 --> 19:34.174
Oh, it's probably cats...

19:34.216 --> 19:36.718
fucking.

19:38.762 --> 19:41.932
Yep, that's cats
fucking, all right--

19:41.974 --> 19:45.602
getting after it.
What do you think, David?

19:48.438 --> 19:51.066
Who'd have thought?

19:51.108 --> 19:53.068
- Listen, that was a great dinner.
- Thank you.

19:53.110 --> 19:54.736
- I'll talk to you soon.
- Thanks. Yeah.

19:54.778 --> 19:56.530
- Thanks, David.
- Good night, Paul.

19:56.572 --> 19:58.866
Good night.

20:24.308 --> 20:27.853
Need more padding on that south wall.
You can hear 'em upstairs.

20:28.854 --> 20:32.107
All right, so you're sure
that they're good?

20:32.149 --> 20:34.234
Positive. On a road trip,

20:34.276 --> 20:37.112
it's gonna be two, three weeks
before anyone notices.

20:37.154 --> 20:39.573
- Healthy?
- Oh, yeah.

20:39.615 --> 20:42.993
- I even took one for a test drive.
- Quit acting up, okay?

20:42.993 --> 20:46.288
I don't want their faces showing up
on the 10:00 news like last time.

20:46.330 --> 20:49.166
- This could sustain us for awhile.
- Trust me.

20:50.167 --> 20:52.586
All right.
Let's get to work.

21:01.136 --> 21:04.348
- Help.
- Room service.

21:07.643 --> 21:10.979
How are we holding up, girls?
Good?

21:14.775 --> 21:17.861
Well, you're
looking good. Hi.

21:20.822 --> 21:23.158
I hope this doesn't change
anything between us.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.577
Wendell, what did I tell you?

21:27.162 --> 21:30.082
Come on, sweetheart.

21:30.123 --> 21:32.501
- Stop it!
- Come on.

21:32.543 --> 21:35.128
Get up.
Oh, yeah!

21:35.170 --> 21:36.880
Don't worry, Sam.

21:36.922 --> 21:40.592
I still got something
right here, okay?

21:40.634 --> 21:43.262
All right, let's
get you up, huh?

21:43.303 --> 21:45.180
You're a live one,
aren't you?

21:45.222 --> 21:48.684
Let's tie you down here.
Let's get you down here.

21:57.818 --> 21:59.862
Is that too tight, sweetie?

22:15.460 --> 22:18.505
- Sounds like he's changing.
- Hey. Hey, Lenny.

22:19.798 --> 22:23.177
Poor guy's
probably hungry.

22:23.218 --> 22:27.055
We'll feed him later.
Just go keep watch.

22:28.891 --> 22:31.685
I'm gonna tuck you in
later, okay?

22:32.811 --> 22:34.354
I got you.

24:00.983 --> 24:03.151
Get in. I'll give you
a ride to school.

24:04.152 --> 24:07.573
I saw some stuff
I want to shoot, Wendell.

24:07.614 --> 24:09.616
Just get the fuck in.

24:10.701 --> 24:13.120
God damn.

24:17.875 --> 24:21.170
You gotta pop your cherry,
baby brother.

24:21.211 --> 24:23.172
Huh?

24:24.423 --> 24:28.385
So you can quit moping around,
playing with that camera.

24:30.888 --> 24:34.474
Hey! Hey.

24:34.516 --> 24:36.852
What, are you too good
to talk to me now?

24:38.854 --> 24:41.690
- Fuck you, Wendell!
- What?!

24:41.732 --> 24:43.859
- What the-- hey! Hey!
- Fuck you!

24:43.901 --> 24:45.194
- Keep it up, Francis!
- No!

24:45.235 --> 24:48.947
Keep it up! We take care
of your sorry ass, all right?

24:48.989 --> 24:51.825
We feed you, we put fucking clothes
on your back,

24:51.867 --> 24:54.786
and you do nothing in return
but complain.

24:54.828 --> 24:56.872
Let go of me!

24:59.958 --> 25:02.044
Dude, l-- look,

25:02.085 --> 25:05.088
I know it fucking seems
fucked up, all right?

25:05.088 --> 25:07.716
But we do what we do

25:07.758 --> 25:09.760
to survive.

25:10.928 --> 25:12.930
All right?

25:15.015 --> 25:18.852
You do anything to fuck up
our family-- most importantly me--

25:18.894 --> 25:21.980
I'll fucking kill you, okay?

25:22.022 --> 25:24.650
Hey! Okay?

25:25.651 --> 25:27.653
Get the fuck out of my truck.

25:54.429 --> 25:58.058
Shut the fuck up
before I gut you myself!

26:15.701 --> 26:17.703
Bye, Lenny.

27:17.721 --> 27:19.681
Hello?

27:22.017 --> 27:24.478
Anybody home?

27:33.403 --> 27:35.697
Yes, hello.
This is David Hamilton.

27:35.739 --> 27:38.242
I'm calling on behalf
of Francis Hamilton.

27:38.242 --> 27:42.079
Yes yes. Yeah,
he's not feeling too well,

27:42.120 --> 27:44.456
got a case of the flu
or something.

27:44.498 --> 27:46.166
Yeah, right right.

27:46.208 --> 27:48.168
Oh, thank you,
I appreciate it.

27:48.210 --> 27:50.337
Have a great day. Bye.

28:18.782 --> 28:22.494
Please don't hurt her
anymore.

28:24.162 --> 28:26.290
I'm not like them.

28:28.166 --> 28:31.420
Then can you help us,
please?

28:36.884 --> 28:39.052
I'm sorry, but I can't.

28:40.053 --> 28:44.224
- Please.
- I don't even have a key.

28:44.266 --> 28:47.144
Do something, please.

28:49.438 --> 28:52.608
I can give you
something to drink.

28:52.649 --> 28:54.860
Do you want
something to drink?

29:47.246 --> 29:49.998
She needs some, please.

29:51.375 --> 29:53.502
I don't have a key.

29:53.544 --> 29:56.046
She just needs water.
She's dying.

29:58.590 --> 30:01.552
I have to go.
Someone will be here soon.

30:09.852 --> 30:11.186
Please.

31:12.789 --> 31:15.417
The top drawer, eh?

31:24.301 --> 31:25.969
You need a fake ID?

31:26.011 --> 31:27.930
Where did you get all those?

31:27.971 --> 31:30.015
I know a guy in the city.

31:30.057 --> 31:32.601
You want one?
I won't charge you.

31:32.643 --> 31:35.270
Yeah.

31:35.312 --> 31:37.898
Let's see.

31:37.940 --> 31:40.609
>>DRIVER LICENSE<<
Here we go-- Dani Cummings.

31:40.651 --> 31:44.404
Oh, look she's an organ donor.
How sweet!

31:44.446 --> 31:46.448
Seems about your height...

31:46.490 --> 31:48.534
- Blonde hair.
- That's okay.

31:48.575 --> 31:51.328
What are you little girls doing?

31:51.370 --> 31:54.122
We are just getting comfortable

31:54.164 --> 31:56.166
and throwing in a flick.

31:56.208 --> 31:58.460
You wanna watch?

31:58.502 --> 32:01.839
I'd love to watch.

32:06.844 --> 32:08.303
Where were you, Francis?

32:08.345 --> 32:11.139
I was just down by the river

32:11.181 --> 32:13.141
filming some stuff.

32:13.183 --> 32:15.269
Pretty late, huh?

32:15.310 --> 32:17.479
Yeah, I guess.

32:17.521 --> 32:19.314
Well, I'm going out
for a little bit.

32:23.694 --> 32:25.988
So if you need anything...

32:27.698 --> 32:29.658
All right.

32:31.076 --> 32:33.078
All right. I'll see you later.

33:42.439 --> 33:45.234
Turn it off, turn it off!

33:46.777 --> 33:49.196
It's just a movie, sweetheart.

33:49.238 --> 33:51.240
I thought you liked
this kind of stuff.

33:51.281 --> 33:54.368
Well, I do.

33:54.409 --> 33:57.871
It's just these movies
are too real sometimes.

33:57.955 --> 34:00.207
Kitty, if monsters were real,

34:00.249 --> 34:02.751
they'd be a lot different
than they are on TV.

34:03.794 --> 34:07.005
Well, I just can't stand
being scared.

34:08.090 --> 34:11.717
Well, what do you
wanna do now?

34:11.760 --> 34:14.346
Let's play a game.

34:16.639 --> 34:19.643
What kind of game?

34:19.685 --> 34:23.105
Let's play truth or dare.

34:23.146 --> 34:25.774
What?

34:25.815 --> 34:27.818
Around here we only play

34:27.860 --> 34:31.405
dare or double dare,
if you can handle it.

34:31.446 --> 34:33.866
- What about truth?
- No truth.

34:33.907 --> 34:37.244
Dares just keep doubling
until someone gets hurt.

34:37.286 --> 34:39.705
- Play nice, Wendell.
- I am.

34:39.746 --> 34:41.665
Okay, Kitty,
you can even go first.

34:41.665 --> 34:43.667
All right.

34:45.127 --> 34:47.004
- Dare or double dare?
- Me?

34:47.045 --> 34:49.297
If you can handle it.

34:51.007 --> 34:52.467
Dare.

34:52.509 --> 34:56.013
I dare you...

34:57.973 --> 35:01.643
to finish your beer
in one drink.

35:10.903 --> 35:13.572
Okay, my turn.

35:13.614 --> 35:16.158
Kitty,

35:16.200 --> 35:17.826
dare or double dare?

35:17.868 --> 35:19.369
Double dare.

35:19.411 --> 35:21.663
Double dare?

35:23.832 --> 35:26.752
I double dare you...

35:26.793 --> 35:28.795
to...

35:29.838 --> 35:32.716
make out with Darlene.

35:37.054 --> 35:39.181
You think I won't?

35:39.223 --> 35:41.016
Well, if you don't,
you lose.

35:42.059 --> 35:45.229
I mean, we could play Scrabble
or something, if you want.

36:03.664 --> 36:06.041
Not bad.

36:06.083 --> 36:09.169
- You surprise me.
- I'm full of them.

36:09.211 --> 36:11.380
Aren't we all?

36:11.421 --> 36:14.758
Okay, Kitty.
It's your turn again.

36:14.800 --> 36:17.261
All right, Darlene...

36:17.302 --> 36:20.514
- dare or double dare?
- Triple dare.

36:20.556 --> 36:23.684
- Triple dare? Come on--
- Triple dare.

36:24.810 --> 36:27.187
Okay...

36:27.229 --> 36:31.108
I triple dare you and Wendell
to make out.

36:33.026 --> 36:35.487
Huh?

36:35.529 --> 36:37.322
Make out with her?

36:38.323 --> 36:40.033
You are a--

36:40.075 --> 36:41.910
just a kinky little thing,
aren't you?

36:41.952 --> 36:43.954
I win.

36:43.996 --> 36:45.747
I don't think so.

37:15.444 --> 37:17.738
Come on in.

37:17.779 --> 37:19.823
- Nice house.
- Thank you.

37:19.865 --> 37:22.034
- And the flowers--
- Yeah.

37:26.663 --> 37:29.458
This is the sort
of fall foliage...

37:29.499 --> 37:31.668
Oh, yeah.

37:31.710 --> 37:34.171
This is the wood--
woodland room.

37:34.171 --> 37:35.923
This is nice.
I like that frame right there.

37:35.964 --> 37:37.466
- Thank you, thank you.
- Very nice work.

37:37.508 --> 37:39.510
Thank you.
I picked it out myself.

37:39.510 --> 37:41.678
Very nicely hung.

37:41.720 --> 37:44.306
We really shouldn't be here.

37:44.348 --> 37:47.809
- Why is that?
- Just--

37:47.851 --> 37:50.646
get in trouble.

37:50.687 --> 37:53.190
We could go to your room
and be quiet.

37:53.190 --> 37:55.817
I don't know, it's kind of--

37:55.859 --> 37:58.028
Come on.

38:00.822 --> 38:02.783
- Okay.
- Okay?

38:02.824 --> 38:04.743
Okay. Just, we gotta be
really quiet, okay?

38:04.785 --> 38:07.037
Okay.

38:58.463 --> 39:01.425
No. No!

39:01.466 --> 39:03.468
No!

39:34.708 --> 39:37.169
No!

39:37.211 --> 39:40.422
Help!

39:41.798 --> 39:43.592
So, sure you
don't want some?

39:43.634 --> 39:45.093
I'm buying.

39:46.428 --> 39:48.472
Pretty good!

39:48.514 --> 39:51.016
No, I'm fine,
thank you.

39:51.058 --> 39:53.352
So...

39:53.393 --> 39:55.395
what did you want
to talk about?

39:57.147 --> 40:00.734
It uh-- you know, something
at school? Something?

40:09.326 --> 40:11.870
My fucking family, just--

40:11.912 --> 40:14.331
I'm sorry?

40:14.331 --> 40:16.959
Yeah, Paul, it's school and stuff,
you know?

40:17.000 --> 40:19.962
- Yeah.
- Teachers and stuff, you know?

40:21.171 --> 40:24.174
You know, I don't know if I ever
told you about this, but--

40:24.216 --> 40:28.971
my dad, when he was
an army captain and--

40:29.012 --> 40:31.515
we moved from base to base,
it seemed like--

40:31.557 --> 40:34.476
Christ, every--
every year or so.

40:34.518 --> 40:38.146
So I know what
it's like to be--

40:38.188 --> 40:40.649
Francis.
Hey, I'm over here, pal.

40:40.691 --> 40:44.152
Yo, Francis, I'm over here.
Francis.

40:49.157 --> 40:51.118
I'm gonna go, Paul.

40:51.159 --> 40:53.120
I have homework and stuff,
you know?

40:53.161 --> 40:56.707
- Just--
- All right.

40:56.748 --> 40:59.668
Well, I'Il--

40:59.710 --> 41:02.671
I'll stop by in a couple of days
and I'Il--

41:02.713 --> 41:05.674
I'll check up on you, all right?
Here. There you go.

41:07.217 --> 41:09.720
- Thanks.
- You're all right?

41:09.761 --> 41:11.763
Yeah.

41:11.805 --> 41:13.932
- Okay.
- Thanks for the soda.

41:13.974 --> 41:15.726
Sure.

41:15.767 --> 41:17.769
You take care, pal.

42:20.457 --> 42:22.876
Wendell, what the fuck
are you doing?

42:22.918 --> 42:25.379
Oh, hey, Francis.

42:28.340 --> 42:30.634
I didn't know you had
a girlfriend.

42:32.761 --> 42:35.764
Seems really nice, huh?

42:39.393 --> 42:41.061
I saw your little movie too--

42:41.103 --> 42:42.813
creepy.

42:44.606 --> 42:47.025
This is a lot of fun,

42:47.067 --> 42:49.528
a lot of fun.

42:49.570 --> 42:51.446
You don't mind sharing
with the family, do you?

42:54.324 --> 42:57.870
You know, I gotta hand it
to you, brother,

42:57.911 --> 43:00.956
you're a lot more like us
than I thought, aren't you?

43:03.000 --> 43:05.544
She's pretty good-Iooking too.

43:05.586 --> 43:07.421
You know, I had
this good idea though.

43:07.462 --> 43:10.632
I was thinking that we--

43:10.674 --> 43:14.052
oh, yeah, look at that.
Look at that.

43:14.094 --> 43:16.847
We could make our own porn movies
down here if we want.

43:16.889 --> 43:19.600
Bitch, huh?

43:19.641 --> 43:22.811
How do you like that?
Huh, Francis?

43:22.853 --> 43:24.646
Huh? Come on, brother,
let's see what you got.

43:24.688 --> 43:28.192
Let's see what you got--
oh, yeah! You fuck!

43:28.233 --> 43:31.195
Come on, bud. Come on, big guy.
Is that all you got?

43:31.195 --> 43:33.197
Is that all you got?
That's what I thought, bitch.

43:33.197 --> 43:35.991
Hey, Sam, how about your little hero
now, huh? Huh?

43:45.751 --> 43:47.961
- Fuck!
- No!

43:48.003 --> 43:50.756
- Get over here! Come on.
- Wendell.

43:50.797 --> 43:54.134
You fucking bitch! Huh? You wanna
show off for that fucking bitch?

43:54.176 --> 43:57.304
Huh? I'll let you.
Come on, Lenny, come and get it!

43:57.346 --> 43:59.306
Come on, Lenny.

43:59.348 --> 44:02.142
Check it out.

44:08.398 --> 44:10.859
You like that feeling, bitch?

44:10.901 --> 44:12.861
Come on.

44:12.903 --> 44:16.907
Hey. Hey, Sam, keep it up.
You keep putting shit in his head,

44:16.949 --> 44:19.409
I'm gonna skin you both
alive, all right?

44:20.452 --> 44:22.538
- Please.
- What was that?

44:23.914 --> 44:25.916
Excuse me?

44:28.418 --> 44:30.921
I'm sorry, I don't think
I heard you right.

44:30.963 --> 44:33.590
What was that? Huh?

44:33.632 --> 44:35.634
What was that?

44:36.760 --> 44:39.388
Okay, I'll tell you what,

44:39.429 --> 44:41.849
why don't you hang out here
for awhile?

44:41.890 --> 44:45.978
I'll come back down and we'll finish
what we started, okay?

44:46.019 --> 44:48.021
You can scream
all you want, Sam.

44:48.063 --> 44:49.940
Just know one thing:

44:49.982 --> 44:53.443
I am going to kill you.

44:53.485 --> 44:55.529
All right?

45:52.878 --> 45:55.339
What are you doing
here, Francis?

45:55.380 --> 45:59.134
- We need to talk.
- What happened to your hand?

45:59.176 --> 46:01.136
Wendell.

46:02.513 --> 46:05.057
I'm working here, Francis.
You know, you can't come running to me

46:05.098 --> 46:09.478
- every time you two have a fight.
- Yeah, but--

46:09.520 --> 46:12.523
I'm getting awfully tired
of your hullabaloo, okay?

46:12.564 --> 46:15.025
Wendell, school...

46:15.025 --> 46:19.029
I can't be with you
24 hours a day, bud.

46:19.071 --> 46:21.823
I have no one else
to talk to, David.

46:25.410 --> 46:27.621
I'm working a double shift
here, okay?

46:27.663 --> 46:31.917
Don't you think it's time you started
trying to handle your own problems?

46:33.460 --> 46:36.547
What would you do, huh?

46:39.383 --> 46:41.385
What do you want me to say?

46:41.426 --> 46:43.971
God.

46:44.012 --> 46:46.473
Man,

46:46.557 --> 46:48.517
I just wish Mom and Dad
were still--

46:48.559 --> 46:50.853
They're dead, Francis, okay?
When are you gonna--

46:54.898 --> 46:57.401
when are you gonna
understand that?

46:57.442 --> 47:00.863
Just go home, okay?
We'll talk about this later.

47:03.866 --> 47:06.702
No. You know what?
Fuck you, David!

47:06.743 --> 47:09.955
Fuck you!
I don't need your help.

47:09.997 --> 47:12.291
Don't even fucking worry
about it.

47:35.439 --> 47:38.317
Hey, Wendell.
Is Darlene home?

47:39.318 --> 47:41.361
She's in her room.

47:47.284 --> 47:50.454
So, what are you doing tonight?

47:53.707 --> 47:56.752
You know I'm spending
the night again.

47:58.670 --> 48:01.048
Darlene?

48:02.341 --> 48:04.343
Hey.

48:16.021 --> 48:18.857
- Is she here?
- No.

48:18.899 --> 48:22.861
I meant, she's coming back
in a bit.

48:26.198 --> 48:28.492
No one's here,
it's just you and me.

48:30.661 --> 48:35.123
Okay, well, I'll just
come back later then.

48:37.042 --> 48:40.128
Why not stay
and wait here, huh?

48:40.170 --> 48:43.966
I should probably
just come back.

48:44.007 --> 48:46.009
Really?

48:46.051 --> 48:48.220
Yeah.

48:48.262 --> 48:50.264
What's the rush?

49:02.150 --> 49:03.861
Anyone ever tell you

49:03.902 --> 49:06.530
you smell absolutely delicious?

49:06.572 --> 49:08.574
Huh?

49:12.411 --> 49:15.330
I bet you taste even better.

49:16.456 --> 49:18.750
- Hey.
- Hi, guys.

49:21.044 --> 49:23.255
I guess you're spending
the night, Kitty?

49:24.256 --> 49:26.258
Yeah.

49:27.259 --> 49:29.261
Come on.

49:32.931 --> 49:35.184
What was that?

49:36.727 --> 49:38.687
He's so weird.

50:09.593 --> 50:13.013
You keep telling yourself
that things will change...

50:14.306 --> 50:18.352
that it's all a bad dream
and one day you'll wake up.

50:18.393 --> 50:22.272
I just wish they would catch us
and then it would be all over.

50:36.119 --> 50:38.205
Stay away from me.

50:38.247 --> 50:40.916
I'm not going to hurt you.

50:40.958 --> 50:44.211
You killed my friend.

50:54.555 --> 50:57.015
I brought you some food.

50:59.101 --> 51:02.437
It's all I could afford.

51:02.479 --> 51:05.274
Is that a joke?

51:05.315 --> 51:08.151
Just go away.

51:08.193 --> 51:11.321
Just go away.

51:14.199 --> 51:15.993
Don't worry.

51:16.034 --> 51:18.036
It's just Lenny.

51:21.999 --> 51:24.084
What's Lenny?

51:24.126 --> 51:26.170
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

51:26.211 --> 51:30.382
You kill people and you feed it
to something you call Lenny?

51:30.424 --> 51:33.844
We're not like you, okay?

51:35.345 --> 51:38.140
We're sick. We have
a fucking disease.

51:38.182 --> 51:41.977
Yeah, you're sick.
You are.

51:45.522 --> 51:47.482
I should go.

51:48.525 --> 51:50.527
Wait.

51:53.488 --> 51:56.950
Can I have some
of that food, please?

52:02.331 --> 52:04.750
It's just--

52:05.751 --> 52:08.504
they'd kill me if they knew
I was here.

52:28.899 --> 52:30.901
- This is looking good.
- Which color are you using?

52:30.943 --> 52:32.569
- This one in here.
- I like it.

52:32.611 --> 52:36.073
Yeah. Okay.

52:36.114 --> 52:38.367
Okay, get you doing this.

52:39.368 --> 52:41.620
I'm just not good at it.

52:41.662 --> 52:44.998
No, just need
a little practice.

53:20.284 --> 53:22.744
Thank you.

53:26.331 --> 53:28.667
What's your name?

53:30.878 --> 53:33.088
Francis.

53:34.298 --> 53:37.634
Can I ask you
something, Francis?

53:41.597 --> 53:44.057
Why did you
bring me food?

53:45.517 --> 53:48.270
Because...

53:48.312 --> 53:51.064
I'm not one of them.

53:53.609 --> 53:56.820
They're gonna
kill me, Francis.

53:57.821 --> 53:59.823
I know.

54:03.994 --> 54:07.789
All you have to do
is call the police.

54:07.831 --> 54:09.791
Please.

54:11.126 --> 54:13.128
My family has money.

54:13.170 --> 54:15.464
They'll give you
anything you need.

54:16.632 --> 54:19.426
You don't understand.
I can't.

54:19.468 --> 54:22.054
Yes, you can.

54:22.095 --> 54:24.765
Yes, you can!

54:26.808 --> 54:29.144
Francis, I have people

54:29.186 --> 54:32.481
who love me, who need me.

54:32.523 --> 54:35.817
I just want to go home.

54:35.859 --> 54:38.070
I want to see my family.

54:38.111 --> 54:41.323
And what about my family?
They're all I have.

54:41.365 --> 54:43.992
They're killers, Francis.

54:44.034 --> 54:45.702
They're not a family.

54:45.744 --> 54:48.497
I can't survive--

54:48.539 --> 54:51.375
can't survive
without them.

56:27.971 --> 56:29.932
Shit.

56:42.194 --> 56:44.196
Hello?

56:47.199 --> 56:50.202
Wendell, are you
messing with me?

57:00.337 --> 57:02.756
Oh my God, you scared
the shit out of me!

57:02.798 --> 57:05.634
Really? What happened?
Let me see.

57:05.676 --> 57:08.679
- Oh my God.
- Can I kiss it and make it better?

57:11.223 --> 57:14.476
I'll just clean it off
in the bathroom.

57:29.032 --> 57:30.993
- Oh, that's a lot of blood.
- Yeah <i>..</i>

57:31.034 --> 57:34.288
- Let me help you.
- Darlene, come on.

57:34.329 --> 57:36.498
Hey, Wendell.

57:36.540 --> 57:39.501
Hey. That's a nasty cut.

57:39.543 --> 57:41.837
Yeah. Wendell, was that you
fucking with me out in the hall?

57:41.879 --> 57:45.048
- Not me. Must've been Darlene.
- Oh, tell the truth, Wendell.

57:45.090 --> 57:47.301
- Truth or dare?
- Ooh, you up for another game, Kitty?

57:47.342 --> 57:49.011
- Can I go first?
- Be my guest.

57:49.052 --> 57:51.638
- Okay. Darlene, dare or double dare?
- Yeah? I don't know,

57:51.680 --> 57:54.725
I'm feeling a little frisky tonight.
How about a double dare to start?

57:54.766 --> 57:56.852
- I double dare you--
- What the hell--?

57:56.894 --> 58:00.189
--to give Kitty a little
seductive dance.

58:01.231 --> 58:02.816
Darlene?

58:02.858 --> 58:05.819
You guys, stop.

58:05.903 --> 58:08.113
Darlene, why are you
doing this?

58:08.155 --> 58:10.866
Stop!
Darlene, stop!

58:13.911 --> 58:16.538
Double dare
or triple dare, Kitty?

58:16.580 --> 58:19.208
I triple dare you to let Wendell
kiss you on the lips.

58:37.226 --> 58:40.229
Here, Kitty Kitty.

58:40.270 --> 58:43.106
Come on, pussycat.

58:43.148 --> 58:45.526
Where are you going, babe?

58:48.070 --> 58:50.030
Where are you going, pussy?

58:50.113 --> 58:52.741
Here, Kitty, Kitty,
Kitty, Kitty.

58:53.784 --> 58:56.245
I don't want
to talk to you in there.

58:58.580 --> 59:00.916
We're not done
with our game yet.

59:49.214 --> 59:51.592
How long have I been out?

59:51.633 --> 59:54.469
Not long--

59:54.511 --> 59:56.555
hour or two.

59:56.597 --> 59:59.016
Somebody will be here soon.

59:59.057 --> 01:00:01.059
I should go.

01:00:08.859 --> 01:00:10.861
Francis...

01:00:13.614 --> 01:00:16.283
Thank you for talking to me.

01:00:19.369 --> 01:00:21.955
I'm sorry, but...

01:00:23.624 --> 01:00:25.292
l--

01:00:25.334 --> 01:00:28.337
I can help you out there.

01:00:30.297 --> 01:00:33.842
I can help you
without your family.

01:00:33.884 --> 01:00:37.221
You don't need them,
Francis.

01:00:39.348 --> 01:00:41.850
I'll take care of you.

01:00:46.605 --> 01:00:49.274
I'll take care of you.

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:53.362
Please, don't kill me.

01:00:57.699 --> 01:01:01.328
You're leaving me here
to die.

01:01:02.329 --> 01:01:04.331
I know.

01:01:24.893 --> 01:01:27.062
Hey, Dad, over here.

01:01:28.105 --> 01:01:30.232
Did you know your redwood
is in violation

01:01:30.274 --> 01:01:32.234
of the neighborhood safety
growth code?

01:01:32.276 --> 01:01:34.403
- No.
- Uh-huh.

01:01:34.444 --> 01:01:37.114
That's a good job, son.
Hi, I'm Larry Davies.

01:01:37.155 --> 01:01:41.076
I'm-- I'm Katherine--
Kitty's uncle.

01:01:41.118 --> 01:01:44.580
- Kitty is a friend of Darlene's.
- Yeah, sure.

01:01:44.621 --> 01:01:47.457
Yeah. This is my son, Allen.

01:01:47.499 --> 01:01:50.586
Lieutenant Commander Daniels,
private sector.

01:01:50.627 --> 01:01:52.754
David Hamilton.

01:01:52.796 --> 01:01:55.257
Just for your information,
Kitty's gonna be staying with us

01:01:55.299 --> 01:01:59.344
this college semester.
So if you see her around, that's why.

01:02:01.138 --> 01:02:02.639
Is everything all right?

01:02:02.681 --> 01:02:05.559
Yeah. Look, I'm sure
it's nothing.

01:02:05.601 --> 01:02:08.729
We're just a little worried, that's all.
We haven't heard from her all day

01:02:08.770 --> 01:02:11.690
and she isn't answering
her cell phone.

01:02:11.732 --> 01:02:13.734
Is she here, by chance?

01:02:13.775 --> 01:02:16.403
Unfortunately, no one's here.

01:02:16.445 --> 01:02:18.906
Darlene doesn't have
a cell phone--

01:02:18.989 --> 01:02:21.617
brain tumors.

01:02:24.453 --> 01:02:27.915
That's strange, you know?
It's just not like her.

01:02:27.956 --> 01:02:32.002
She said she was gonna be spending
the night here last night with Darlene,

01:02:32.044 --> 01:02:36.006
and she knew we had plans
for this morning.

01:02:36.006 --> 01:02:38.008
I put a couple of calls in

01:02:38.050 --> 01:02:41.220
to some friends of mine
down at the local sheriff's office,

01:02:41.261 --> 01:02:43.889
just in case.

01:02:43.931 --> 01:02:47.935
But if you hear from her,
please call that number.

01:02:47.976 --> 01:02:50.729
Of course, of course.

01:02:50.771 --> 01:02:53.398
Hey, look, l--

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:55.817
I know we are bothering you
and all that,

01:02:55.859 --> 01:02:57.903
but we didn't have
your number.

01:02:57.945 --> 01:03:01.448
So we just thought
we'd pop by and check.

01:03:01.490 --> 01:03:03.158
So, if something turns up--

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.202
Just let me know
if there's anything I can do.

01:03:08.914 --> 01:03:10.916
Take care.

01:03:21.134 --> 01:03:22.803
What did you do?

01:03:22.845 --> 01:03:25.514
Why, nothing, David.

01:03:25.556 --> 01:03:28.100
She left here this morning.
We really haven't seen her since.

01:03:28.141 --> 01:03:30.143
I can't believe
you two did this!

01:03:30.227 --> 01:03:32.646
Oh, and what
about the dozen homos

01:03:32.688 --> 01:03:34.982
you have buried
under the house?

01:03:35.023 --> 01:03:37.568
Yeah, Mr. Perfect,
how do you explain that?

01:03:37.609 --> 01:03:40.112
Are you that blind in your
make-believe world,

01:03:40.153 --> 01:03:41.989
you don't think we know?

01:03:42.030 --> 01:03:44.157
I use my head!

01:03:44.199 --> 01:03:46.994
I pick transients
and drifters,

01:03:47.035 --> 01:03:49.830
not some neighborhood girl
whose cousin or--

01:03:49.872 --> 01:03:52.249
or brother or whatever
is the police!

01:03:52.291 --> 01:03:55.169
You know why you hate us
so much, David?

01:03:55.210 --> 01:03:58.213
It's because
we represent everything

01:03:58.255 --> 01:04:00.048
you wish you could have,

01:04:00.090 --> 01:04:03.343
but are just too afraid
to face.

01:04:18.942 --> 01:04:21.320
You two always--

01:04:21.361 --> 01:04:23.071
fuck it up!

01:04:23.113 --> 01:04:27.201
Are you trying
to scare us, David,

01:04:27.242 --> 01:04:30.245
like when we were kids?

01:04:30.287 --> 01:04:32.581
We're not little kids anymore.

01:04:32.623 --> 01:04:34.708
So what are you
gonna do, David?

01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:36.877
When are you gonna realize
this isn't the first time

01:04:36.919 --> 01:04:40.088
and certainly not the last time
it's gonna happen?

01:04:40.130 --> 01:04:42.716
Pull it together.

01:04:42.758 --> 01:04:44.718
Hey!

01:04:47.846 --> 01:04:50.807
- Mom and Dad--
- Mom and Dad were the exception.

01:04:50.849 --> 01:04:54.561
None of us have the kind
of self-control to have what they did.

01:04:54.603 --> 01:04:56.772
The only difference
between you and us, David,

01:04:56.813 --> 01:04:59.107
is we don't look at ourselves
in the mirror and lie.

01:04:59.149 --> 01:05:01.693
We accept who we are.

01:05:01.735 --> 01:05:03.445
We don't deny it.

01:05:05.739 --> 01:05:08.075
We have to move again.

01:05:12.371 --> 01:05:15.999
All right, pack up
what we need--

01:06:28.989 --> 01:06:30.657
- Hi, this is Paul.
- Hey, Paul--

01:06:30.699 --> 01:06:32.618
Please leave your message
at the sound of the tone.

01:06:32.659 --> 01:06:35.370
Don't forget to leave
your phone number. Bye.

01:06:35.412 --> 01:06:37.414
Paul, it's Francis.

01:06:37.456 --> 01:06:40.417
There's something really important
we gotta talk about

01:06:40.459 --> 01:06:43.378
about my family
and um...

01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:46.131
I can't-- I can't do it
over the phone.

01:06:46.173 --> 01:06:48.383
If you could meet me in person,
that'd be great.

01:06:48.425 --> 01:06:50.928
l-l-I just--
fuck!

01:06:50.969 --> 01:06:52.971
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

01:07:15.452 --> 01:07:18.205
I know, Lenny.
I know.

01:07:18.247 --> 01:07:20.874
It's coming.

01:07:20.916 --> 01:07:23.919
It's coming, Lenny!
Please sit still.

01:08:08.338 --> 01:08:10.841
Actually, it's--
it's kind of funny.

01:08:10.883 --> 01:08:14.636
My father taught me
how to do this.

01:08:14.678 --> 01:08:16.721
It's kooky, I know,
I know.

01:08:16.763 --> 01:08:19.515
He just wanted to make sure
if something were to happen to him,

01:08:19.558 --> 01:08:21.852
we'd still survive.

01:08:22.895 --> 01:08:26.982
Now you gotta get it
just right, so no air gets in.

01:08:28.024 --> 01:08:30.527
It has a longer shelf life
that way.

01:08:31.528 --> 01:08:33.529
It's kind of like...

01:08:35.073 --> 01:08:37.075
frozen food.

01:08:38.368 --> 01:08:40.370
You have something
on your face there.

01:08:40.412 --> 01:08:42.163
Oh, I apologize,

01:08:42.206 --> 01:08:45.250
I don't mean to make you
self-conscious or anything.

01:08:46.877 --> 01:08:48.837
"David," he said,
"David--

01:08:48.879 --> 01:08:52.381
David, one day
you might have to be

01:08:52.424 --> 01:08:54.426
the man of this family.

01:08:57.554 --> 01:08:59.555
David...

01:08:59.555 --> 01:09:02.017
David," he said--
he said, "David,

01:09:02.059 --> 01:09:05.354
you might have to be
the one that takes care

01:09:05.395 --> 01:09:07.856
of your brothers
and your sister."

01:09:08.941 --> 01:09:11.318
And I do, I do,

01:09:11.359 --> 01:09:13.987
but they don't care.

01:09:14.029 --> 01:09:16.323
Do you think they appreciate
what I do for them?

01:09:16.365 --> 01:09:20.035
No no no no.

01:09:26.625 --> 01:09:28.877
Look, missy,

01:09:28.919 --> 01:09:31.380
I don't mean to be a rude cunt,
but it sort of seems to me

01:09:31.421 --> 01:09:34.216
that you're not listening
to me.

01:09:34.258 --> 01:09:36.385
I just want
what's best for them.

01:09:37.761 --> 01:09:39.846
I just want what's
best for them.

01:09:39.888 --> 01:09:42.975
I just want
what's best for them.

01:10:19.386 --> 01:10:21.680
Goodbye, Lenny.

01:11:05.891 --> 01:11:07.893
Francis?

01:11:10.938 --> 01:11:12.940
Hey, Francis,
I got your message.

01:11:17.611 --> 01:11:20.197
Francis?

01:11:31.375 --> 01:11:34.127
David, are you here?
Francis?

01:11:38.507 --> 01:11:40.467
Francis?

01:11:44.429 --> 01:11:46.431
Francis, is that you?

01:11:49.434 --> 01:11:51.562
Francis, you out here?

01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:30.350
Hello?

01:13:09.139 --> 01:13:11.850
David? David?

01:13:11.892 --> 01:13:13.560
Da--

01:13:15.354 --> 01:13:17.105
David?

01:13:17.147 --> 01:13:19.107
David?

01:13:22.653 --> 01:13:24.446
David?

01:13:24.488 --> 01:13:26.865
Hello?

01:13:26.907 --> 01:13:30.285
David, are you all right?
Hey, I'll try to get you out.

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:34.498
Here, listen, I'm gonna--

01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:37.167
shit.

01:13:37.209 --> 01:13:40.587
You hiding there, huh?
Are you all right?

01:13:41.839 --> 01:13:45.133
Hi. Everything's going to be okay.

01:13:45.175 --> 01:13:47.261
Stop it, stop--

01:13:47.302 --> 01:13:49.471
What are you doing?

01:13:51.557 --> 01:13:53.350
What are you doing?!

01:13:53.392 --> 01:13:55.602
- Ah, no!
- No, Lenny!

01:13:55.644 --> 01:13:57.855
No! Stop!

01:13:57.896 --> 01:14:00.607
No no!

01:14:16.373 --> 01:14:19.793
Ooh, what happened?

01:14:22.337 --> 01:14:24.965
- He's still alive. We can drain him.
- Not him.

01:14:27.050 --> 01:14:29.344
Aren't you the one who said
they're just cattle to us

01:14:29.386 --> 01:14:31.346
and nothing else?

01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:37.978
- Just do what you want.
- Look at this.

01:14:43.650 --> 01:14:46.486
So, I guess he took her
with him?

01:14:46.528 --> 01:14:48.405
Fuck!

01:14:48.447 --> 01:14:50.365
I didn't know the little fucker
had it in him.

01:14:53.911 --> 01:14:56.371
I'm actually
kind of proud of the kid.

01:14:56.413 --> 01:14:58.415
Yeah, well, he's gonna
get himself in trouble.

01:14:58.457 --> 01:15:00.959
He's right on the verge.

01:15:01.001 --> 01:15:03.212
We've gotta find him.

01:15:03.253 --> 01:15:05.923
Maybe you should
go get him.

01:15:07.174 --> 01:15:09.051
He looks up to you.

01:15:25.609 --> 01:15:28.153
Will you still help me
out there?

01:15:34.368 --> 01:15:36.620
Francis,

01:15:36.662 --> 01:15:38.664
where are we?

01:15:43.043 --> 01:15:45.045
We're hiding.

01:15:47.089 --> 01:15:49.633
Are you okay?

01:15:52.302 --> 01:15:54.847
We should get some help.

01:15:56.014 --> 01:15:59.560
Francis,
I need your help.

01:15:59.601 --> 01:16:02.563
I can't come near you.

01:16:04.982 --> 01:16:08.235
Francis, I can't hear you.
What?

01:16:08.277 --> 01:16:11.154
What did you say,
Francis?

01:16:11.196 --> 01:16:13.949
You're bleeding.

01:16:13.991 --> 01:16:17.911
Francis, you're scaring me.

01:16:19.496 --> 01:16:22.124
There's something
I need to tell you.

01:16:22.165 --> 01:16:24.418
Please-- please,

01:16:24.459 --> 01:16:27.129
just help me get up.

01:16:27.171 --> 01:16:29.798
We need to get help.

01:16:34.678 --> 01:16:37.139
We're born, not made.

01:16:40.267 --> 01:16:43.437
- Not like everybody thinks.
- I don't understand.

01:16:43.478 --> 01:16:46.356
Oh Christ,
let me go.

01:16:46.398 --> 01:16:48.150
Please, please--

01:16:49.526 --> 01:16:51.528
Not like the fucking movies.

01:16:51.570 --> 01:16:53.947
Francis, please stop.

01:16:53.989 --> 01:16:55.657
You have to go.

01:16:55.699 --> 01:16:58.702
Francis, please
don't do this.

01:17:27.231 --> 01:17:29.191
Franny.

01:17:29.233 --> 01:17:31.860
Franny.

01:17:37.074 --> 01:17:39.201
I know.

01:17:39.243 --> 01:17:41.495
We all gotta go
through it our first time.

01:17:44.373 --> 01:17:46.542
It's just the way
it is, okay?

01:17:51.964 --> 01:17:55.717
- I wish Mom and Dad were here.
- It just hurts so bad, David.

01:17:55.759 --> 01:17:58.720
I know, I know.

01:17:58.762 --> 01:18:01.265
It's just part
of growing up, okay?

01:18:03.267 --> 01:18:05.269
It's what we are.

01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:55.611
What does it mean
to be happy?

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:02.951
To be content
in the world around you?

01:19:17.591 --> 01:19:20.219
Is family the heart
of everything--

01:19:24.181 --> 01:19:26.683
even existence?

01:19:50.290 --> 01:19:52.584
So what do we do now?

01:19:54.378 --> 01:19:56.380
We have to move again.

01:19:59.091 --> 01:20:01.093
The twins are packing up
the house.

01:20:01.134 --> 01:20:03.178
We're gonna leave
in a few hours.

01:20:12.521 --> 01:20:14.606
What about Lenny?

01:20:16.316 --> 01:20:18.610
We're gonna have to bring him
out of the box early.

01:20:21.738 --> 01:20:23.740
Will he be okay?

01:20:24.867 --> 01:20:27.077
You were brought
out of the box early.

01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:31.874
I was?

01:20:31.915 --> 01:20:34.001
Yeah. See how
you turned out?

01:20:37.254 --> 01:20:40.174
- Dave?
- Yeah?

01:20:42.593 --> 01:20:44.595
I'm sorry.

01:20:47.055 --> 01:20:49.016
So am I, Francis.

01:20:55.731 --> 01:20:58.567
- Are you ready?
- Okay.

01:21:01.028 --> 01:21:03.655
You guys, I really
hate keeping him like this.

01:21:03.697 --> 01:21:05.032
You know it's the way
it's always been.

01:21:05.073 --> 01:21:06.533
He would've
killed everything in sight.

01:21:06.617 --> 01:21:08.368
- Kind of like us. You ready, David?
- Let me do this.

01:21:08.410 --> 01:21:10.329
We're gonna open the door.
We don't have time for this.

01:21:10.370 --> 01:21:11.705
- This is Lenny!
- Darlene, come on.

01:21:11.747 --> 01:21:15.125
- David, let's go!
- He is-- he is our family!

01:21:15.167 --> 01:21:17.211
I can do this.

01:21:19.922 --> 01:21:22.216
Okay.

01:21:23.717 --> 01:21:25.719
Are you sure?

01:21:27.721 --> 01:21:29.723
Fine.

01:21:34.603 --> 01:21:36.563
Lenny?

01:21:39.733 --> 01:21:41.735
Lenny?

01:21:43.862 --> 01:21:45.614
Lenny?

01:21:46.657 --> 01:21:49.243
Hey, baby.

01:21:54.665 --> 01:21:56.959
Excited?

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.211
Hey, baby.

01:22:01.713 --> 01:22:04.007
You see?

01:23:09.114 --> 01:23:11.742
We live with a disease.

01:23:13.660 --> 01:23:17.164
Mom used to say it was
the one thing that kept us close.

01:23:18.373 --> 01:23:21.460
I always thought that it was the one
thing that would keep us apart.

01:23:22.836 --> 01:23:25.047
But I was wrong,

01:23:25.088 --> 01:23:28.967
and everything you thought
you knew about us is wrong.

01:23:30.427 --> 01:23:33.055
We live in the houses
next to you,

01:23:33.096 --> 01:23:36.183
we work in the stores
you shop at.

01:23:36.225 --> 01:23:39.061
Our kids play with your kids.

01:23:41.230 --> 01:23:44.107
We're just trying to be
an ordinary family,

01:23:44.149 --> 01:23:47.945
trying to figure out
where we fit in in the world.

01:23:59.331 --> 01:24:03.335
But we do need blood,
and we need a lot of it...

01:24:08.966 --> 01:24:11.927
...preferably fresh
and not frozen.

01:24:11.969 --> 01:24:14.346
Howdy.

01:24:14.388 --> 01:24:16.640
We're the Thompsons.
