00:10.000 --> 00:22.000
You're Watching 123Movies.to

00:36.593 --> 00:37.542
Okay, go ahead.

00:37.874 --> 00:41.321
My name is Sidney Westerfeld.
I'm the owner of this antique tavern...

00:41.745 --> 00:43.468
...Monmouth Valley, New York State.

00:44.784 --> 00:47.534
I was here when
this crowd really came.

00:48.465 --> 00:51.400
We expected fifty thousand a day,
and there must have been a million!

00:52.433 --> 00:55.498
l, myself, was hungry for two days,
because I couldn't get any food in.

00:55.568 --> 00:56.649
I couldn't get out to buy any food.

00:58.225 --> 01:00.014
I was eating cornflakes for two days!

01:01.458 --> 01:04.010
And the kids were wonderful.
I have no kicks.

01:04.144 --> 01:05.933
It was "sir" this and "sir" that, and...

01:06.577 --> 01:08.170
..."thank you" this and
"thank you" that.

01:10.003 --> 01:14.224
Nobody can complain about the kids.
This thing was too big.

01:15.281 --> 01:19.175
It was too big for the world!
Nobody has ever seen a thing like this!

01:19.632 --> 01:24.367
And when they see this picture in
the news, over the moving pictures...

01:24.497 --> 01:25.706
...they'll really see something!

01:38.544 --> 01:43.018
"It's been a long time coming..."

01:46.769 --> 01:51.275
"...because it's been
a long time gone..."

01:55.698 --> 02:00.170
"...and it appears to be a long..."

02:00.687 --> 02:04.137
"...appears to be a long..."

02:05.009 --> 02:08.685
"...appears to be a long..."

02:09.168 --> 02:13.639
"...time. It's a long,
long, long, long time..."

02:14.704 --> 02:16.166
"...before the dawn."

02:24.624 --> 02:29.097
"Turn, turn any corner."

02:33.072 --> 02:36.521
"Hear, hear, you must hear..."

02:36.882 --> 02:39.402
"...what the people say."

02:42.928 --> 02:44.302
"You know that something..."

02:45.520 --> 02:48.455
"...is going on around here."

02:49.424 --> 02:53.197
"But surely, surely, surely..."

02:53.487 --> 02:56.300
"...one day I'm going to have my day."

02:57.648 --> 03:02.122
"Oh, it appears to be
a long, yes it does..."

03:03.182 --> 03:06.696
"...appears to be a long..."

03:07.407 --> 03:10.277
"...appears to be a long..."

03:11.568 --> 03:16.040
"...ah-ha, such a long, long time..."

03:17.967 --> 03:20.554
"...before the dawn."

03:27.183 --> 03:30.860
"Speak out, you've got to speak out..."

03:31.184 --> 03:33.093
"...against the madness."

03:35.023 --> 03:38.917
"You've got to speak your
mind, yes, today..."

03:44.688 --> 03:49.159
"...but don't, no, don't, don't
try to get yourself elected."

03:52.847 --> 03:57.320
"If you do, you'll have
to cut your hair..."

04:00.527 --> 04:05.001
"...and it appears to be
a long, yes, it does..."

04:05.488 --> 04:09.032
"...appears to be a long..."

04:09.903 --> 04:12.620
"...appears to be a long..."

04:13.935 --> 04:18.408
"...time, such a long,
long, long time..."

04:19.406 --> 04:21.161
"...before the dawn."

04:28.847 --> 04:33.320
"It's been a long time coming..."

04:36.527 --> 04:41.000
"...it's going to be
a long time gone..."

04:45.583 --> 04:47.242
"...but you know..."

04:49.583 --> 04:51.491
"...the darkest hour..."

04:55.181 --> 04:59.656
"...the darkest phase, is always
just before the dawn..."

05:02.798 --> 05:06.855
"...and it appears to be a long..."

05:08.077 --> 05:10.861
"...appears to be a long..."

05:11.823 --> 05:16.294
"...appears to be a long time..."

05:17.742 --> 05:21.321
"...such a long, long,
long, long time..."

05:21.647 --> 05:23.022
"...before the dawn."

05:36.206 --> 05:38.791
Hey, Mike, what's the worst part
of running one of these things?

05:40.462 --> 05:41.193
The worst part?

05:41.486 --> 05:42.915
What's the worst part of running one?

05:44.557 --> 05:45.506
I don't know.

05:46.541 --> 05:47.468
You dig it all?

05:51.502 --> 05:54.819
I guess the biggest hassle is
dealing with politics. You know.

05:55.150 --> 05:56.904
Is there a lot of politics involved?
You mean with the cities?

05:58.028 --> 05:59.010
And you got that solved?

05:59.661 --> 06:00.391
Well, it looks that way.

06:01.549 --> 06:03.656
How long did it take you to put
it together. Two, three months?

06:04.014 --> 06:06.022
Uh, been working on it
for about nine months.

06:06.351 --> 06:08.008
Nine months! Full time?

06:10.958 --> 06:13.064
Are you in charge of the whole thing?

06:13.550 --> 06:14.182
Yes.

06:14.510 --> 06:15.338
But you got backers?

06:16.623 --> 06:17.899
Partners and backers.

06:18.382 --> 06:19.243
Where are you going to go from here?

06:19.790 --> 06:20.901
I mean, are you going
to do another one?

06:21.389 --> 06:22.283
If it works.

06:28.365 --> 06:29.674
Aw, you're really good tonight!

06:30.221 --> 06:31.016
You know...

06:32.621 --> 06:35.720
...this is the most outrageous spectacle
I've ever witnessed. Ever!

06:36.269 --> 06:37.546
There's only one thing I wish.

06:38.125 --> 06:39.172
I sure have to pee!

06:41.548 --> 06:43.010
And there just is nowhere to go!

06:45.774 --> 06:48.108
I believe we're "GOING UP THE
COUNTRY" a little bit right now.

07:07.597 --> 07:11.558
"I'm going up the country,
baby, don't you want to go?"

07:13.420 --> 07:17.313
"I'm going up the country,
baby, don't you want to go?"

07:18.860 --> 07:22.854
"I'm going to someplace,
where I've never been before."

07:24.876 --> 07:27.877
"I'm going, I'm going, where
the water tastes like wine."

07:30.285 --> 07:34.758
"I'm going where the
water tastes like wine."

07:36.141 --> 07:39.819
"We can jump in the water,
stay drunk all the time."

07:58.699 --> 08:02.694
"I'm going to leave this city.
Got to get away."

08:04.460 --> 08:08.452
"I'm going to leave this city.
Got to get away."

08:10.219 --> 08:14.693
"All this fussing and fighting,
man, you know I sure can't stay."

08:15.981 --> 08:19.395
"Now, baby, pack your leaving trunk.
You know we've got to leave today."

08:19.724 --> 08:21.633
"Just exactly where
we're going, I cannot say..."

08:21.996 --> 08:25.891
"...but we might even leave the U.S.A."

08:27.564 --> 08:32.070
"Because it's a brand new
game and I want to play."

08:50.315 --> 08:54.756
"No use in your running or
screaming and crying..."

08:56.076 --> 09:00.517
"...because you've got a home
as long as I've got mine."

10:21.771 --> 10:26.278
"If you smile at me,
I will understand..."

10:27.051 --> 10:31.524
"...because that is something everybody,
everywhere does in the same way."

10:45.322 --> 10:49.794
"I can't see why you called
a friend from the other side."

10:51.081 --> 10:53.949
"There's just one thing
I've got to know..."

10:54.248 --> 10:58.080
"...can you tell me who I am?"

11:09.164 --> 11:11.584
"Say, can I have some of
your purple berries?"

11:11.945 --> 11:16.386
"Yes, I've been eating them
six or seven weeks now."

11:17.067 --> 11:21.539
"Haven't got sick once,
probably keep us both alive."

11:29.482 --> 11:32.198
"Wooden ships on the water..."

11:32.521 --> 11:35.685
"...very free, easy, easy."

11:36.712 --> 11:39.942
"You know, the way it's supposed to be."

11:41.226 --> 11:45.697
"Silver people on the
shoreline, let us be."

11:46.441 --> 11:50.272
"Talking about very free and easy."

12:10.761 --> 12:15.233
"All the ships that
watch as you die..."

12:16.681 --> 12:21.152
"...all they can do is
echo your anguished cry."

12:22.345 --> 12:26.817
"Still I go keep on feeling, why?"

12:27.528 --> 12:32.036
"We are leaving. You don't need us."

12:52.104 --> 12:52.867
What do you think?

12:53.192 --> 12:54.141
Well, what could I think?

12:55.048 --> 12:58.878
We're in the middle of the, of the
situation and we make the best of it.

12:59.113 --> 13:00.159
It's about all we can do.

13:03.622 --> 13:07.901
We were standing on the curbs
watching them come in, uh, last night.

13:07.976 --> 13:09.057
All the townspeople.

13:09.609 --> 13:13.667
It was just like a, an army invading
a town. It's hard to believe.

13:14.024 --> 13:14.722
Do you live here?

13:15.048 --> 13:16.477
No, we're here for a vacation.

13:17.289 --> 13:18.183
Are you having one?

13:19.049 --> 13:21.699
We did, up until last night.
They kept us up for a while.

13:22.023 --> 13:22.656
Who is they?

13:23.209 --> 13:24.157
Freaks.

13:25.032 --> 13:26.309
Is that what you call yourselves?

13:28.681 --> 13:29.313
Sure.

13:29.641 --> 13:30.272
Why?

13:30.600 --> 13:31.877
Well, because that's what
everybody else calls us.

13:32.041 --> 13:33.382
What do you call yourself that for?

13:33.671 --> 13:37.021
Because we admit it. Compared
to everybody else, we're freaks.

13:37.576 --> 13:40.837
I don't think you are. As long as you
behave yourself, there's nothing wrong.

13:42.120 --> 13:45.347
I'm not putting bad connotations on the
word "freak", you know. I'm just...

13:45.863 --> 13:49.126
Don't you think that the word "freak"
itself has a bad connotation?

13:49.481 --> 13:50.757
It's whatever you think about it.

13:51.304 --> 13:55.394
Last time we saw anything like this was
at the Rose Bowl Parade last New Year's.

13:55.687 --> 13:56.353
That's right.

13:59.272 --> 14:02.819
Like four ice cubes
out of the bag, you know.

14:03.721 --> 14:04.965
They wanted to buy four ice cubes?

14:05.129 --> 14:06.021
Yeah, right.

14:08.231 --> 14:11.048
I don't know, what can you charge
them for ice cubes? You know.

14:11.592 --> 14:14.854
It's a great shot in the arm to Sullivan
County, business-wise.

14:14.920 --> 14:16.032
Something we needed.

14:17.288 --> 14:22.306
As far as whether it will leave a
favorable effect later, besides money...

14:23.432 --> 14:25.472
...we'll know when the festival is over.

14:26.567 --> 14:27.941
Uh, they're beautiful people.

14:31.367 --> 14:35.198
Well is this festival
affecting you in any way?

14:36.008 --> 14:37.762
Well, it's kind of overwhelming us.
Put it this way.

14:38.054 --> 14:38.752
In what way?

14:39.591 --> 14:42.691
Just to take care of,
to try to get the people fed,

14:42.760 --> 14:44.418
I would say is one of the main
objectives here.

14:44.488 --> 14:45.568
I know all these young fellows here,

14:45.640 --> 14:47.680
they've got to be fed
and they're going to get hungry.

14:48.040 --> 14:50.690
I hope that they can bring
enough supplies in for, for...

14:50.759 --> 14:52.483
That seems to be the big trouble.

14:52.903 --> 14:55.172
And traffic, that's... well, you know
yourself without me telling you.

14:55.528 --> 14:56.324
What's it done for business?

14:56.681 --> 14:57.629
Oh, come on.

14:58.600 --> 15:01.534
What's it done?
Increased it about what?

15:02.150 --> 15:04.223
As much as you can do.
Put it this way. And more.

15:04.679 --> 15:05.955
I'll say one thing for the young people.

15:06.023 --> 15:07.616
They've been very nice.
All of them. So far.

15:11.047 --> 15:15.071
It's really amazing. Yet it looks like
some kind of Biblical, epochal...

15:15.719 --> 15:17.279
...unbelievable scene!

15:19.942 --> 15:21.851
They're all, you know, like all...
You see these cars,

15:21.927 --> 15:24.415
they're strewn on the sides of
the roads from the helicopters and...

15:25.511 --> 15:28.413
...in all different angles, you know. They
look like jackstraws and stuff like that.

15:28.743 --> 15:31.264
There is this continual flow of people
just riding the stream.

15:31.336 --> 15:32.611
They're going along and it...

15:33.990 --> 15:36.413
Jerry, it was all frozen.
So let's enjoy. It was all I could get.

15:37.064 --> 15:39.169
Well, I mean, I mean,
from a practical point of view,

15:39.240 --> 15:41.508
what do you think,
how could they limit this crowd?

15:42.566 --> 15:45.118
They didn't want this many people
here, really, I don't think.

15:46.310 --> 15:48.733
So you find the control points at
the beginning of the highways...

15:49.031 --> 15:52.707
...and those with tickets are allowed
in and those without tickets are not.

15:52.775 --> 15:53.854
You have to have some control.

15:56.198 --> 15:58.434
You know, when you
have man-eating...

15:58.502 --> 16:02.148
...Barabunda ants coming over
a hill in South America...

16:02.247 --> 16:05.028
...they want to cut them off and stop
them from coming. They make a ditch...

16:05.318 --> 16:07.205
...they put oil in the ditch and
they make a flame.

16:07.270 --> 16:09.157
Now I'm not saying they should put up
flames to stop the people...

16:10.599 --> 16:13.861
...but there has to be some way of
stopping the influx of humanity.

16:14.790 --> 16:16.514
Uh, in numbers, tell me,
how many do you expect?

16:16.807 --> 16:17.755
Two hundred thousand.

16:18.598 --> 16:20.542
Two hundred thousand people
here over the three days?

16:21.576 --> 16:22.240
Where will you put them?

16:22.695 --> 16:26.338
We have contracted for land
surrounding the area...

16:26.629 --> 16:30.242
...setting up camp grounds, water
facilities, toilets, electric, food.

16:30.599 --> 16:32.257
What does it cost to put one
of these things together?

16:32.327 --> 16:32.993
A fortune.

16:34.982 --> 16:36.672
And I suppose the returns
will also be good.

16:37.157 --> 16:40.385
Yeah, we'll probably... I don't, I don't
know what the returns will come up to...

16:41.028 --> 16:42.404
...up to what it's cost or not, but...

16:43.878 --> 16:46.148
...the point is that it's happening.
A couple of million dollars.

16:48.869 --> 16:51.869
In other words, you have to make
two million dollars to break even?

16:52.197 --> 16:55.166
Well, if we're going to break even.
Huh, you know.

16:55.783 --> 16:58.019
The point is that it's
happened and it's working...

16:59.206 --> 17:00.154
...and it's enough for now.

17:01.637 --> 17:03.973
What is it that musicians have?
Are you a musician yourself?

17:04.487 --> 17:07.170
What is it the musicians have that they
can communicate so well to the kids?

17:07.238 --> 17:07.837
Music!

17:08.423 --> 17:09.632
I mean, they've always had music.

17:09.990 --> 17:12.029
Music has always been a
major form of communication.

17:12.357 --> 17:14.626
Only now the lyrics and the type
of music is a little bit...

17:15.589 --> 17:16.834
...more involved
in society than it was.

17:18.117 --> 17:19.394
I need something now, let me tell you,

17:19.492 --> 17:22.590
to kind of run as a voice over...
when I'm showing this music on...

17:23.876 --> 17:25.250
If you could, if you could tell me...

17:25.317 --> 17:28.186
...that I can run your voice over
while this music is playing...

17:29.446 --> 17:31.997
...what the music is saying, kind
of, you know, what that's about.

17:32.516 --> 17:33.890
It's about what's happening now...

17:33.957 --> 17:36.992
...and if you listen to the lyrics
and you listen to the, to the rhythm...

17:38.150 --> 17:39.099
...and, and what's in the music...

17:39.175 --> 17:40.702
...then you'll know what's,
what's going on with the culture.

17:41.350 --> 17:42.298
I've got to split.

17:42.757 --> 17:44.994
Can we count on you?
Great, groovy. Thanks.

17:49.703 --> 17:52.418
I'd like... Mike hangs out here.

17:52.741 --> 17:53.886
I'd like to see a little bit of him.

17:53.957 --> 17:57.219
Just natural sound, while he's
getting harassed and bugged. Okay?

17:59.877 --> 18:01.437
Now, goddamnit, I was going
to call you last week!

18:02.310 --> 18:06.302
That means you've got to call me and
I've got to get that thing into the air.

18:06.660 --> 18:08.634
Now I'm going to order
a five-passenger helicopter.

18:08.708 --> 18:10.000
I'm really scared the roads
are going to get jammed up.

18:10.000 --> 18:10.945

back fifteen yards and punt!

18:22.000 --> 18:22.108
...of getting a room closer
than Middletown.

18:22.437 --> 18:24.030
There's a Holiday Inn in
Middletown, New York.

18:41.605 --> 18:43.100
Let's clear the road, please!

18:44.868 --> 18:47.072
Peel back, peel back there!
Let them through.

18:47.588 --> 18:49.496
Everything has room to flow here.

18:53.508 --> 18:54.402
Please walk...

18:55.077 --> 18:56.025
...on the grass.

19:02.340 --> 19:06.683
Walk on the sides of the road if you're
going to walk through here. Let's go.

19:11.685 --> 19:12.994
How is it out there?

19:16.869 --> 19:20.762
We apologize for the, uh, noise
of the choppity-choppy, but...

19:21.220 --> 19:24.963
...it seems there are a few cars blocking
the road, so we're flying everybody in.

19:26.148 --> 19:29.497
I almost made the worst pun in the world
about high musicians, but we'll skip that.

19:30.787 --> 19:32.215
You know Artie? Artie Kornfeld.

19:32.770 --> 19:33.818
How you doing, man?

19:35.748 --> 19:36.544
Good to see you, man.

19:36.868 --> 19:38.046
Glad you could make the party.

19:38.852 --> 19:41.568
It's going beautifully, man.
Wouldn't have it any other way.

19:41.763 --> 19:42.690
It's really together.

19:43.299 --> 19:45.372
Look at the way...
It really worked out nice, didn't it?

19:46.147 --> 19:47.008
Looks fantastic!

19:47.332 --> 19:48.642
The vibes are so beautiful.

19:48.965 --> 19:49.914
Everybody helps everybody.

19:49.989 --> 19:52.475
Today it feels so great
right here, you know?

19:54.532 --> 19:57.403
How can I ever live on the east
side of Manhattan after this scene?

19:59.812 --> 20:01.918
Yeah, man, it smells like strawberries!

20:04.164 --> 20:05.178
It's perfume! Oh, it is!

20:14.820 --> 20:15.767
"Just Like A Woman"...

20:18.819 --> 20:19.899
...and "Let's Get Stoned."

20:25.058 --> 20:26.847
We're in sync, but you can't
hear a fucking thing...

20:27.171 --> 20:31.428
...because of the fucking helicopters,
so I'm going to quit!

20:31.748 --> 20:32.926
Because of the fucking helicopters...

20:32.996 --> 20:36.158
...I can't get a fucking piece
of dialogue at all, man.

20:36.482 --> 20:38.457
I'm hanging around
blowing my brains out!

20:44.388 --> 20:45.337
We're getting it tied up.

20:46.147 --> 20:47.162
Two or three of the groups are in.

20:47.235 --> 20:49.722
We're just trying to match up two groups
and equipment and we'll be okay.

20:52.163 --> 20:55.327
Can those of you in the back hear well?

20:56.547 --> 20:59.164
Raise your hands please.
It's all right? Thank you.

21:00.897 --> 21:02.808
Marijuana! Exhibit A.

21:05.699 --> 21:07.291
Look at all those people!

21:09.763 --> 21:14.236
The Daily News, in rather large
headlines, still costing ten cents...

21:15.107 --> 21:17.497
..."TRAFFIC UP TIGHT AT HIPPIE FEST."

21:20.738 --> 21:23.227
See, if you see the,
show the picture in India...

21:23.331 --> 21:25.187
...they won't believe
this is taken in America.

21:26.788 --> 21:29.340
Because their impression
of American children...

21:29.602 --> 21:31.261
...and American ways
is completely different.

21:32.418 --> 21:36.576
All neatly dressed, put on hat
and tie and sitting on chairs.

21:36.899 --> 21:38.142
That's not like this at all.

21:39.715 --> 21:43.096
Wheat Germ, Holly has your bag
with your medicine.

21:43.425 --> 21:46.360
Please meet at the information booth
as soon as you can, please.

21:46.561 --> 21:50.785
Helen Savage, please call your father
at the Motel Glory in Woodridge.

21:56.930 --> 21:58.872
The warning that I've received
you might take it...

21:58.946 --> 22:00.856
...with however many grains
of salt you wish...

22:01.668 --> 22:06.456
...that the brown acid that is circulating
around is not specifically too good.

22:08.452 --> 22:10.655
It is suggested that you stay
away from that...

22:10.723 --> 22:12.632
...but it's your own trip, so be my guest.

22:13.185 --> 22:15.487
Please be advised there is
a warning on the one, okay?

22:19.970 --> 22:21.344
Sam, can you get the monitors on?

22:22.177 --> 22:25.559
Get some more guys over here.
This is going to be the heavy side.

22:28.065 --> 22:30.816
Richard Boch, get back to Eddie
Kramer in the sound truck.

22:35.745 --> 22:38.014
- Watch your fingers right up there!
- Hold it.

22:45.730 --> 22:47.006
Mr. Richie Havens!

24:25.184 --> 24:28.534
"Hey, look-a yonder,
tell me what's that you see..."

24:28.865 --> 24:31.581
"...marching to the fields of concord?"

24:32.384 --> 24:35.896
"Looks like Handsome Johnny, with
his flintlock in his hand..."

24:36.223 --> 24:38.459
"...marching to the Concord war."

24:39.424 --> 24:42.207
"...hey, marching to the Concord war."

24:54.208 --> 24:57.656
"Hey, look-a yonder,
tell me what's that you see..."

24:57.985 --> 25:00.538
"...marching to the fields of Dunkirk?"

25:01.730 --> 25:04.696
"Looks like Handsome Johnny
with a carbine in his hand..."

25:05.248 --> 25:07.320
"...marching to the Dunkirk war."

25:08.449 --> 25:11.645
"Hey, marching to the Dunkirk war."

25:28.607 --> 25:31.903
"Hey, look-a yonder,
tell me what's that you see..."

25:32.287 --> 25:35.485
"...marching to the fields of Korea?"

25:36.065 --> 25:39.576
"Looks like Handsome Johnny
with his M-1 in his hand..."

25:39.903 --> 25:42.140
"...marching to the Korean war."

25:43.104 --> 25:46.039
"Hey, marching to the Korean war."

25:46.368 --> 25:50.841
"Still marching, still
marching, still marching."

25:54.303 --> 25:56.857
"It's a long, hard road..."

26:05.022 --> 26:08.285
"...that he fought so we'll be free."

26:08.703 --> 26:13.175
"That he fought, we'll be free.
Yeah, free!"

26:39.583 --> 26:42.617
"Hey, look-a yonder,
tell me what's that you see..."

26:43.424 --> 26:46.455
"...marching to the
fields of Birmingham?"

26:47.166 --> 26:50.363
"Looks like Handsome Johnny with
his hand rolled in a fist..."

26:50.847 --> 26:53.400
"...marching to the Birmingham war."

26:54.142 --> 26:57.241
"Hey, marching to the Birmingham war."

27:03.423 --> 27:06.837
"Hey, what's the use
of singing this song?"

27:07.262 --> 27:09.980
"Some of you are not even listening."

27:10.783 --> 27:14.132
"Tell me what it is we've got to do?"

27:14.463 --> 27:17.244
"Wait for the bombs to start whistling?"

27:17.887 --> 27:20.920
"Wait for the blitz to start blitzing?"

27:21.727 --> 27:24.542
"Here comes a hydrogen bomb..."

27:25.086 --> 27:27.900
"...and here comes a guided missile."

27:28.926 --> 27:31.739
"Here comes a hydrogen bomb..."

27:32.220 --> 27:35.572
"...I cannot hear it whistle!"

27:36.063 --> 27:40.535
"I can almost hear its whistle,
yeah, yeah, yeah!"

28:01.439 --> 28:04.919
There are a hundred million
songs going to be sung tonight.

28:06.014 --> 28:08.566
All of them are going to be
singing about the same thing...

28:09.502 --> 28:13.494
...which I hope everybody who
came, came to hear, really.

28:14.685 --> 28:17.883
And it's all about you, actually.

28:18.526 --> 28:22.682
And me and everybody around this stage
and everybody that hasn't gotten here.

28:23.005 --> 28:25.907
And the people who are going
to read about you tomorrow.

28:30.495 --> 28:31.989
And how really groovy you were.

28:34.365 --> 28:36.919
All over the world.
If you can dig where that's at.

28:36.990 --> 28:38.846
That's really where it's really at.

29:25.885 --> 29:27.608
Guitar mike, please.

29:43.548 --> 29:45.850
"Freedom! Freedom!"

29:57.981 --> 30:04.627
"Sometimes I feel like
a motherless child..."

30:19.485 --> 30:23.761
"...a long way from home."

30:29.085 --> 30:31.931
"Yeah, yeah, Lord..."

30:34.524 --> 30:36.891
"...singing freedom! Freedom!"

30:53.339 --> 30:57.268
"Sometimes I feel like
I'm almost gone..."

31:14.843 --> 31:23.323
"...a long, long, long
way, way from home."

31:28.763 --> 31:29.843
"Clap your hands!"

31:59.162 --> 32:01.432
"I've got a telephone in my bosom..."

32:03.164 --> 32:04.953
"...and I can call
him up from my heart."

32:06.972 --> 32:08.794
"I've got a telephone in my bosom..."

32:10.331 --> 32:12.786
"...and I can call him
up from my heart..."

32:12.922 --> 32:14.330
"...when I need my brother!"

32:16.636 --> 32:18.229
"When I need my father! "

32:21.275 --> 32:22.322
"Mother!"

32:25.114 --> 32:25.845
"Sister!"

32:27.804 --> 32:29.713
"When I need my brother!"

32:30.427 --> 32:33.240
"Brother! Hey! Mother! "

33:32.282 --> 33:33.625
"Mr. Richie Havens."

33:38.490 --> 33:41.623
What better way to start than
with the beautiful "Richie Havens."

33:52.794 --> 33:53.809
It's worth it.

33:57.785 --> 34:00.305
Just to see the lights
go on last night, man!

34:01.369 --> 34:03.442
Just to see the people stand up,
man, it makes it worth it.

34:07.162 --> 34:09.364
I mean, I feel there will be people,
you know...

34:09.431 --> 34:11.636
...there are people out there
that really don't dig it.

34:12.281 --> 34:13.228
Very few of them.

34:13.304 --> 34:16.601
But you know, it really is to
the point where it's just a family, man.

34:18.585 --> 34:22.098
All box office people please
go to the main box office.

34:22.168 --> 34:23.795
We don't need it any more.

34:24.313 --> 34:27.958
Somebody unplugged the lines, man.
Let's have a hot mike.

34:29.594 --> 34:30.870
Number two, number three.

34:37.049 --> 34:40.049
You are not giving the world's
greatest three day freebee!

34:40.248 --> 34:41.393
Okay, there's only one way to do it.

34:41.880 --> 34:42.677
There's a way to do it, man.

34:43.032 --> 34:43.828
There is no way.

34:43.992 --> 34:45.583
The only way to do it is
to get into a rap with...

34:45.655 --> 34:47.795
It's okay. Come here. Come here.

34:49.369 --> 34:53.012
This is one thing I was going to wait
a while before we talked about it.

34:53.721 --> 34:56.110
But maybe we'll talk about it now so
you can think about it.

34:56.697 --> 34:58.552
It's a free concert from now on!

35:04.920 --> 35:08.151
That doesn't mean that anything goes.
What that means is...

35:08.731 --> 35:10.618
...we're going to put the
music up here for free.

35:12.026 --> 35:14.262
What it means is that the people
who are backing this thing...

35:14.329 --> 35:16.467
...who put up the money for it,
are going to take a bit of a bath.

35:17.433 --> 35:21.111
A big bath. There's no hype, that's
true. They're going to get hurt.

35:22.201 --> 35:25.680
But what it means is that these
people have it in their heads...

35:26.487 --> 35:29.520
...that your welfare is a hell
of a lot more important...

35:29.814 --> 35:31.342
...and so is the music, than a dollar.

35:33.402 --> 35:36.466
Look, when they hook the electricity up,
a great jolt runs all the way through here.

35:36.824 --> 35:39.246
If you've got the ticket,
you disconnect the circuit and...

35:39.320 --> 35:40.913
...otherwise you disintegrate.

35:42.296 --> 35:43.889
Wendy and Mayar... , Maynard...

35:43.961 --> 35:46.809
...from Fair Lawn, please meet
Jill in front of the stage.

35:48.953 --> 35:52.467
George has a slight problem.
He broke his arm.

35:53.689 --> 35:56.755
Oh, it's on Forty-second Street. Tiny Tim
used to sing there. Did you know that?

35:57.240 --> 36:00.470
Under the name of Robert, uh, Love.
Larry Love!

36:02.104 --> 36:03.315
Could I get the picture, too?

36:03.672 --> 36:07.501
Oh, yes. Toot too, too, too.
Tell me, little girl, what's your name?

36:07.991 --> 36:09.900
My name is Beth Riley, and what's yours?

36:10.199 --> 36:11.921
My name is Hugh.

36:12.886 --> 36:14.711
How do you do? My name is Sue.

36:15.352 --> 36:16.432
I'll see you around.

36:18.167 --> 36:20.174
Ah, here they come, here they come.

36:26.841 --> 36:33.037
My name is Hugh Romney. I'm with the
Hog Farm. And I'm working on a scene.

36:33.688 --> 36:37.398
Some people call it bum trips. I don't
think there is such a thing as a bum trip.

36:37.849 --> 36:40.401
We're working with hobo voyages.

36:41.240 --> 36:44.436
A half an hour after we release anybody
from our section...

36:44.503 --> 36:45.681
...we turn them into doctors...

36:46.680 --> 36:50.836
...and they care for people that were
tripping like they were when they came in.

36:52.471 --> 36:55.766
Now people have been saying that
some of this acid is poison.

36:56.086 --> 37:00.561
It's not poison, it's just bad acid.
It's manufactured poorly.

37:00.888 --> 37:02.032
If you can find out who it is, we...

37:02.390 --> 37:05.260
Anybody who thinks they've
taken some poison, forget it.

37:06.872 --> 37:10.000
And if you feel like experimenting,
only take half a tab. Okay? Thank you.

37:10.000 --> 37:10.222
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!
And if you feel like experimenting,
only take half a tab. Okay? Thank you.

37:10.222 --> 37:22.000
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

38:24.598 --> 38:28.275
You know, the Japanese
made that motorcycle.

38:29.814 --> 38:33.131
The Japanese affected that
thing over there...

38:35.479 --> 38:37.170
...with the yellow robes,
or the Indian.

38:42.615 --> 38:44.437
Really does a lot for the music
that motorcycle.

46:08.593 --> 46:09.541
Who's on?

46:09.713 --> 46:12.431
A guy named Bert Sommers.
I think Timmy Hardin is going on next.

46:13.745 --> 46:16.462
So the order of everything
just went kaplooey?

46:16.848 --> 46:17.862
You're closing tonight, honey.

46:20.303 --> 46:22.672
Maybe there'll be
a few more people here by then.

46:22.737 --> 46:24.144
I don't like a puny gathering like this.

46:28.753 --> 46:33.226
I'd like to sing you a song that is one of
my husband, David's, favorite songs.

46:34.385 --> 46:37.384
And let me just tell you
that he is fine. And...

46:48.880 --> 46:50.308
...and we're fine too.

46:54.001 --> 46:56.521
And David was just shifted
from the county jail...

46:57.201 --> 47:01.160
...which is very much of a drag,
to Federal prison...

47:01.487 --> 47:03.079
...which is kind of like
a big summer camp...

47:03.150 --> 47:05.804
...after you've been
in county jail long enough.

47:06.065 --> 47:07.439
See I just, just now got a letter.

47:07.761 --> 47:11.950
I have it with me. About the trip from the
county jail. Manacles on his legs...

47:12.272 --> 47:16.429
...and his arms manacled to his belt.
Well, I mean, it's all worth writing about.

47:16.753 --> 47:20.103
He doesn't care, you know.
And there's only one time that...

47:20.433 --> 47:23.629
...where the first time he felt afraid
in the whole thing, was a couple of...

47:25.746 --> 47:27.982
...I guess guards, or something,
they started talking very loud.

47:28.049 --> 47:29.064
And he started saying...

47:29.169 --> 47:31.339
...talking about the last draft case
that they had been through...

47:31.408 --> 47:33.547
...and "that motherfucker," and "we'll
get you, motherfucker," you know?

47:35.600 --> 47:37.029
He just prayed a little bit harder.

47:38.833 --> 47:41.549
He wouldn't do anything anyhow, but
it's not a very comfortable feeling.

47:41.616 --> 47:43.274
But nothing has happened.

47:45.712 --> 47:47.752
Anyway, this is, this
is an organizing song.

47:48.080 --> 47:49.673
And I'm, I was happy to find out that...

47:50.065 --> 47:52.104
...after David had been in jail
for two and a half weeks...

47:52.432 --> 47:54.635
...he already had a very,
very good hunger strike...

47:55.247 --> 47:56.905
...going on with forty-two
federal prisoners...

47:57.615 --> 47:59.405
...none of whom were draft people.

48:05.968 --> 48:09.799
"I dreamed I saw Joe
Hill last night..."

48:11.760 --> 48:15.055
"...alive as you and me."

48:17.167 --> 48:21.608
"Sez l, 'But Joe,
you're ten years dead!"'

48:22.192 --> 48:26.469
"'I never died, ' said he."

48:35.312 --> 48:39.752
"'The copper bosses
killed you, Joe!"'

48:40.463 --> 48:43.628
"'They shot you, Joe, ' says I."

48:45.776 --> 48:50.248
"'Takes more than guns
to kill a man'..."

48:50.798 --> 48:54.629
"Says Joe, 'I didn't die!"'

49:03.599 --> 49:08.106
"And standing there as big as life..."

49:09.071 --> 49:12.387
"...and smiling with his eyes."

49:14.831 --> 49:18.661
"Says Joe, 'What they
can never kill,"

49:19.439 --> 49:23.051
"...went on to organize."'

49:32.559 --> 49:36.751
"From San Diego up to Maine..."

49:37.520 --> 49:41.000
"...in every mine and mill..."

49:42.831 --> 49:47.304
"...where working men
defend their rights..."

49:47.759 --> 49:51.054
"...it's there you find Joe Hill!"

50:55.854 --> 50:58.406
"Swing low..."

51:00.974 --> 51:05.448
"...sweet chariot..."

51:09.197 --> 51:13.637
"...coming to carry me home."

51:21.293 --> 51:23.910
"Swing low..."

51:26.573 --> 51:30.401
"...sweet chariot..."

51:33.453 --> 51:37.927
"...coming for to carry me on home."

51:44.365 --> 51:46.953
"Well, I looked over yonder..."

51:48.174 --> 51:50.476
"...and what did I see..."

51:53.133 --> 51:57.606
"...coming to carry me home?"

52:02.412 --> 52:06.240
"Saw a band, a band of angels..."

52:11.053 --> 52:15.525
"...were a-coming for me..."

52:17.196 --> 52:21.670
"...coming for to carry me on home."

52:28.493 --> 52:31.047
"Swing low..."

52:36.493 --> 52:40.966
"...swing low, sweet chariot..."

52:44.173 --> 52:48.644
"...coming for to carry
me on home. Home!"

53:33.034 --> 53:34.311
"See me,"

53:36.812 --> 53:38.089
"feel me,"

53:40.395 --> 53:41.671
"touch me,"

53:44.395 --> 53:46.306
"heal me."

54:38.892 --> 54:43.364
"Listening to you, I get music."

54:43.852 --> 54:48.073
"Gazing at you, I get heat."

54:48.554 --> 54:53.029
"Following you, I'd climb a mountain."

54:53.515 --> 54:57.028
"I get excitement at your feet."

55:00.233 --> 55:04.708
"Right behind you, I see the millions."

55:05.516 --> 55:09.289
"On you, I see the glory."

55:09.994 --> 55:13.769
"From you, I get opinions."

55:14.475 --> 55:18.086
"From you, I get the story."

55:20.491 --> 55:24.322
"Listening to you, I get music."

55:24.651 --> 55:28.327
"Gazing at you, I get the heat."

55:28.714 --> 55:32.643
"Following you, I'd climb a mountain."

55:32.971 --> 55:36.320
"I get excitement at your feet."

55:38.794 --> 55:42.622
"From behind you, I see the millions."

55:43.272 --> 55:46.624
"On you, I see the glory."

55:47.115 --> 55:50.561
"From you, I get opinions."

55:51.210 --> 55:54.406
"From you, I get the story."

57:10.000 --> 57:22.000
You're Watching 123Movies.to

59:15.272 --> 59:19.199
"Now, I'm a-gonna raise a fuss.
Now, I'm going to raise a holler..."

59:22.312 --> 59:26.142
"...about a-working all summer,
just to try and earn a dollar."

59:29.127 --> 59:32.477
"Well, I went to the boss,
said, 'I've got a date."'

59:32.808 --> 59:36.070
"The boss said, 'No dice, son.
You've got to work-a late."'

59:36.649 --> 59:39.582
"Sometimes, I wonder
what I'm going to do."

59:40.007 --> 59:43.521
"There ain't no cure for
the summertime blues."

59:57.031 --> 01:00:00.860
"Well, my mom and poppa told me,
'Son, you've got to earn some money..."'

01:00:04.005 --> 01:00:07.836
"'... if you want to use the
car to go riding next Sunday."'

01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:13.987
"Well, I didn't go to work.
I told the boss I was sick."

01:00:14.311 --> 01:00:17.988
"Says they, 'You can't use the car,
because you didn't work a lick."'

01:00:18.311 --> 01:00:21.344
"Sometimes I wonder what
I'm a-gonna do."

01:00:21.671 --> 01:00:25.349
"There ain't no cure for
the summertime blues."

01:01:33.606 --> 01:01:37.761
"I'm going to take two weeks,
going to have a fine vacation."

01:01:40.709 --> 01:01:44.540
"Going to take my problems
to the United Nations."

01:01:47.528 --> 01:01:50.625
"Well, I went to my Congressman.
He said..."

01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:54.465
"'... l'd like to help you, son,
but you're too young to vote."'

01:01:54.888 --> 01:01:57.920
"Sometimes I wonder
what I'm going to do."

01:01:58.407 --> 01:02:02.148
"There ain't no cure for
the summertime blues."

01:03:35.525 --> 01:03:36.637
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:03:40.675 --> 01:03:41.602
...The Who!

01:03:48.964 --> 01:03:50.720
The word I get is that...

01:03:50.948 --> 01:03:52.858
...maybe the best thing
for everybody to do...

01:03:52.996 --> 01:03:55.517
...unless you have a tent
or some place specific to go to...

01:03:56.677 --> 01:03:59.545
...just carve yourself out
a piece of territory...

01:04:00.549 --> 01:04:01.825
...say goodnight to your neighbor...

01:04:04.774 --> 01:04:08.002
...and say thank you to yourself
for making this the most peaceful...

01:04:08.165 --> 01:04:11.295
...most pleasant day anybody has
ever had in this kind of music.

01:04:19.908 --> 01:04:20.704
Well, music is a thing that...

01:04:21.027 --> 01:04:22.553
Well, you're obviously
not here for the girls.

01:04:22.883 --> 01:04:24.793
Oh, that's good, that's a basic
thing, you know, like...

01:04:25.123 --> 01:04:27.066
...there are a lot of girls here
and they're probably...

01:04:27.141 --> 01:04:29.029
...a lot freer than,
you know, other places.

01:04:30.404 --> 01:04:32.029
I'm sure there's going
to be a lot of balling.

01:04:33.507 --> 01:04:35.417
Well, you bring your own coals
to Newcastle?

01:04:35.491 --> 01:04:37.980
Are you two going together
or are you just hitching together?

01:04:40.293 --> 01:04:42.713
We've lived together for about
four months, or five months.

01:04:44.292 --> 01:04:46.529
You know, with a lot of other people.
Kind of what you'd call...

01:04:46.596 --> 01:04:48.767
...a communal thing, or someone
else would call a communal thing.

01:04:49.284 --> 01:04:51.838
But it's just, we just live together...

01:04:51.973 --> 01:04:54.176
...and so we just decided to come down
together because we were coming here.

01:04:55.332 --> 01:04:58.016
And like there's nothing, I mean,
no definite thing about...

01:04:58.244 --> 01:05:00.099
We're not necessarily going to be
together throughout the whole thing.

01:05:00.516 --> 01:05:02.174
So you're not particularly
jealous of him?

01:05:04.356 --> 01:05:05.303
Are you two going together?

01:05:06.819 --> 01:05:07.833
But you two came up here together.

01:05:09.635 --> 01:05:10.267
You like that?

01:05:10.595 --> 01:05:13.890
Yeah, I like her.
I love her. I enjoy her.

01:05:14.434 --> 01:05:15.808
What do you think about all this?

01:05:16.291 --> 01:05:17.568
Well, the way I look at it...

01:05:18.275 --> 01:05:22.051
...like I've known Jerry for what?
Four or five, six months now.

01:05:22.372 --> 01:05:24.859
When he moved into the family group...

01:05:24.995 --> 01:05:26.849
...that I was alr...
that I already knew for quite a while...

01:05:28.676 --> 01:05:32.125
...in that time, I got to know him
real well and I learned to love him.

01:05:33.861 --> 01:05:35.801
Like, you know, we ball
and everything, but...

01:05:37.283 --> 01:05:40.316
...it's really a pretty good thing because
I have plenty, there's plenty of freedom.

01:05:40.643 --> 01:05:44.321
Because if we're not going together and
we're not in love or anything like that...

01:05:46.531 --> 01:05:48.156
Can you communicate
with your parents?

01:05:48.482 --> 01:05:51.930
I can communicate with
them on, on one level.

01:05:52.290 --> 01:05:54.527
Now that I've been away
from home for two years.

01:05:54.595 --> 01:05:56.122
But at first it was very rough.
Now...

01:05:57.410 --> 01:05:59.964
...they, you know, they're beginning
to mellow about it.

01:06:00.035 --> 01:06:01.890
It's not so hard on them I'm the way I am.

01:06:02.787 --> 01:06:04.478
But I can't really communicate to them...

01:06:04.579 --> 01:06:07.263
...about anything that's really important
because they just could not understand it.

01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:10.553
My mother is really, she really...

01:06:10.916 --> 01:06:11.864
...lives in a lot of pain...

01:06:12.003 --> 01:06:14.241
...because she's sure I'm going to
go to hell and there's nothing I can do...

01:06:14.821 --> 01:06:18.529
...to tell her that there is,
that it just does not exist for me.

01:06:20.163 --> 01:06:22.650
So l, there's no communication
on, on those levels.

01:06:22.978 --> 01:06:26.241
My father was asking whether I was in a
communist training camp or something...

01:06:26.724 --> 01:06:27.999
...in, in the house that I lived in.

01:06:30.082 --> 01:06:32.634
I could understand, you know, where
he came from. Because when he...

01:06:33.665 --> 01:06:34.613
...well, he's an immigrant, you know.

01:06:34.689 --> 01:06:35.966
And so he came over here
to better himself...

01:06:36.033 --> 01:06:38.107
...economically and so forth,
and all that other rot.

01:06:39.075 --> 01:06:42.685
And, to make it better for me and he can't
understand why I didn't play, you know...

01:06:43.330 --> 01:06:44.639
...saying, "Why aren't
you playing the game?"

01:06:46.210 --> 01:06:48.120
"Here's all this opportunity.
Here's, here are all these things...

01:06:48.195 --> 01:06:49.405
...which have so much value."

01:06:50.147 --> 01:06:51.293
But they only have value to him...

01:06:51.428 --> 01:06:53.696
...and he can't understand
why they don't have value to me.

01:06:54.019 --> 01:06:58.014
But he does have wisdom enough
to know, to allow me to be who I am.

01:07:00.611 --> 01:07:02.650
I guess he had some kind of
idea in his head that...

01:07:03.362 --> 01:07:07.138
...I will, by doing what I'm doing,
learn for myself how to live.

01:07:07.459 --> 01:07:09.117
And that's what he wants me to do,
anyway.

01:07:09.186 --> 01:07:11.128
So he, he can't understand
why I am the way I am...

01:07:11.458 --> 01:07:13.596
...but he, he very much wants
me to be that way.

01:07:13.697 --> 01:07:15.769
Because he knows that's
the only thing for me.

01:07:16.129 --> 01:07:18.682
He started his trip when
he was four years old.

01:07:18.979 --> 01:07:19.611
Really?

01:07:19.650 --> 01:07:21.560
Nothing to do with drugs or anything?

01:07:22.659 --> 01:07:23.673
Me, neither.

01:07:24.481 --> 01:07:25.758
Do you think that's a cop-out or...?

01:07:26.113 --> 01:07:29.081
l, I don't know. L, I used
to be into drugs and...

01:07:32.323 --> 01:07:33.533
...I was very heavy on drugs, but...

01:07:33.859 --> 01:07:35.963
...now it seems like
it's almost contrived.

01:07:36.546 --> 01:07:40.376
It's like drugs and revolution
and the united front and all.

01:07:42.338 --> 01:07:44.892
You know, I'm a human being and that's
all I want to be. And I don't...

01:07:46.626 --> 01:07:48.153
...I don't want to have a mass change...

01:07:48.257 --> 01:07:51.072
...because a mass change only brings
around mass insanity.

01:07:52.418 --> 01:07:56.127
I just want to be myself and find
out, find a place where I can...

01:07:57.762 --> 01:08:01.590
...maintain some kind of
balance within myself, you know.

01:08:01.921 --> 01:08:04.791
I'm kind of like the Hamlet trip,
you know. To be or not to be.

01:08:05.121 --> 01:08:08.349
Do you think you could ever communicate
with a guy like Nixon or Westmoreland?

01:08:08.512 --> 01:08:09.461
I hope so.

01:08:09.857 --> 01:08:11.200
They're doing their thing, aren't they?

01:08:11.937 --> 01:08:15.483
I don't know. It's like they,
they're neurotic or psychotic or...

01:08:16.194 --> 01:08:18.495
...having fun as they say in
Life Mag... I don't know.

01:08:18.817 --> 01:08:20.158
They could say the same thing of you.

01:08:20.319 --> 01:08:24.578
Yeah, right. But it's not true, because,
l, I don't need all that power, you know.

01:08:24.964 --> 01:08:27.613
Where I can just, I can just sit
here right on this roadside...

01:08:28.290 --> 01:08:30.526
...and l, I don't have to become
President of the United States.

01:08:30.593 --> 01:08:32.764
And I don't have to go all that way up.

01:08:33.663 --> 01:08:34.712
I don't have to make the climb.

01:08:35.937 --> 01:08:38.807
Because there's nothing to climb for.
It's all sitting right here.

01:08:40.224 --> 01:08:41.653
Do you have tickets to this thing?

01:08:42.015 --> 01:08:42.648
No.

01:08:43.296 --> 01:08:44.243
How are you going to get in?

01:08:47.904 --> 01:08:48.798
I don't really know.

01:08:51.425 --> 01:08:52.701
I figured, you know, once I got here...

01:08:52.768 --> 01:08:55.354
...l'd see whatever happens
and go along with it.

01:08:56.737 --> 01:08:58.625
It's like people that are nowhere
are coming here...

01:08:58.689 --> 01:09:00.095
...because there are people
they think are somewhere...

01:09:00.288 --> 01:09:03.769
...so everybody is really looking for,
you know, for some kind of answer.

01:09:04.129 --> 01:09:05.176
Where there isn't one.

01:09:07.138 --> 01:09:08.415
Why would three hundred thousand...

01:09:08.515 --> 01:09:10.107
...or a hundred and
twenty thousand sixty thousand...

01:09:10.178 --> 01:09:12.479
...seventy thousand people come
to anything just because it's music?

01:09:13.569 --> 01:09:16.732
I mean, was music all that important?
I don't really think so.

01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:21.560
People don't know, they don't know how
to live and they don't know what to do...

01:09:21.697 --> 01:09:22.841
...and they think that if they...

01:09:22.912 --> 01:09:25.018
...can come here they can find out.
You know, what it is...

01:09:25.089 --> 01:09:26.363
...or how to maintain with it.

01:09:28.319 --> 01:09:30.229
It's just like people
are very lost, I think.

01:09:33.281 --> 01:09:37.752
America leads the whole
world in several ways.

01:09:41.857 --> 01:09:43.768
Very recently, when
I was in the East...

01:09:45.441 --> 01:09:47.350
...the grandson of Mahatma Gandhi...

01:09:49.825 --> 01:09:52.607
...met me and asked me...

01:09:53.761 --> 01:09:55.189
...what's happening in America?

01:09:58.816 --> 01:09:59.765
And I said,

01:10:01.921 --> 01:10:04.223
"America is becoming a whole."

01:10:06.879 --> 01:10:10.009
"America is helping everybody..."

01:10:11.359 --> 01:10:12.789
"...in the material field..."

01:10:14.304 --> 01:10:18.775
"...but the time has come for
America to help the whole world..."

01:10:19.615 --> 01:10:21.754
"...with spirituality, also."

01:10:46.496 --> 01:10:47.128
"At the hop..."

01:10:48.127 --> 01:10:50.331
"...we can rock to and fro and
never let go, at the hop, hop, hop."

01:10:51.488 --> 01:10:53.592
"When the records are playing,
people eat a lot of chicken..."

01:10:53.662 --> 01:10:54.610
"...at the hop, hop, hop."

01:10:54.975 --> 01:10:57.594
"If you've got a little chicken, share
it with your baby, at the hop, hop, hop."

01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:01.373
"Oh, baby, hop! Let's go to the hop.
Oh, baby, let's go to the hop."

01:11:01.695 --> 01:11:06.169
"Oh, baby, let's go to the hop!
Oh, baby, let's go to the Hop!"

01:11:18.145 --> 01:11:21.919
"Well, let us go now. Let's go to the
hop. Let's go to the hop, oh, baby!"

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:24.956
"Let's go to the hop, oh, baby.
Let's go to the hop."

01:11:25.535 --> 01:11:29.113
"Go, go, let's go to the hop!
Let's go, go!"

01:11:39.135 --> 01:11:41.437
"We will go rocking and rolling
and stomping at the hop!"

01:11:42.622 --> 01:11:44.956
"When the records are playing and the
women start a-singing at the hop!"

01:11:59.296 --> 01:12:00.955
"Oh, let's go now.
Let's go to the hop! "

01:12:01.536 --> 01:12:06.008
"Let's go to the hop, oh baby.
Let's got to the hop, oh baby."

01:12:06.719 --> 01:12:09.435
"Come on, let's go to the hop.
Hop!"

01:12:33.951 --> 01:12:35.511
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Sha-Na-Na!

01:12:35.838 --> 01:12:36.952
Harold, turn up the mike.

01:12:40.415 --> 01:12:43.284
Now, very slowly, start coming back up.

01:12:43.679 --> 01:12:46.330
Lower the lock and
pull yourself back up.

01:12:54.942 --> 01:12:56.917
And then keep breathing
as fast as you can.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:22.000
