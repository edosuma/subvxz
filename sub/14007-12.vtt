00:02.790 --> 00:04.260
Patty's husband is having an affair.

00:04.270 --> 00:07.600
She's a senior financial analyst with the London branch of Phil's firm.

00:07.630 --> 00:09.400
Invest in UNR, Phil.

00:09.410 --> 00:11.170
I want to take a position in UNR.

00:11.190 --> 00:13.840
The bureau's putting together a case we'll want Patty to take.

00:13.870 --> 00:16.180
We'll use you to monitor it from the inside.

00:16.210 --> 00:19.430
Would just help so much if I could get a little extra.

00:19.470 --> 00:20.940
I think we can manage that.

00:20.960 --> 00:21.890
He's going to walk.

00:21.920 --> 00:23.840
Did you hear what happened with Tom's plaintiff?

00:23.880 --> 00:25.130
She wanted a payoff.

00:25.160 --> 00:26.220
Tom turned her down.

00:26.260 --> 00:30.310
Our firm was hired to do toxicity studies on aracite.

00:30.340 --> 00:32.049
Is it toxic?
Extremely.

00:32.060 --> 00:36.050
Did Ultima National Resources doctor the results?

00:36.080 --> 00:38.970
UNR doctored nothing. The results are clean.

00:38.980 --> 00:42.360
Whatever happened that night in your house with your wife is over.

00:42.380 --> 00:46.510
Mr. Kendrick just wanted you to know
that the first wire transfer went through.

00:46.540 --> 00:48.300
It's about Daniel Purcell.

00:48.330 --> 00:50.300
He wants to set things right.

00:50.330 --> 00:54.950
Kendrick is using an energy trader to manipulate the energy market.

00:54.980 --> 00:57.460
Someone sure has been using the navigation system a lot.

00:57.490 --> 01:03.020
Could they be transferring information to the energy trader using the gps?

01:03.050 --> 01:04.599
Parsons knows too much.

01:04.610 --> 01:05.610
Take her out.

01:05.650 --> 01:07.050
Or I call your old lieutenant.

01:07.070 --> 01:08.580
I tell him what I know.

01:08.610 --> 01:11.040
And I send you to prison for life.

01:11.050 --> 01:15.110
My buddy... he's got a cabin upstate. We could go this weekend.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.074

01:25.190 --> 01:26.640
Where are grandma and grandpa?

01:26.670 --> 01:28.480
They went out for orange juice.

01:28.500 --> 01:30.310
I'm gonna take taylor for a walk, okay?

01:30.350 --> 01:32.860
All right. But just stay in the yard. And make sure you wear a scarf.

01:32.870 --> 01:35.660
Come on.
I'll call you in for breakfast.

01:38.270 --> 01:41.130
Give me the stick. Come on!

01:41.890 --> 01:43.490
Come on!

01:49.480 --> 01:52.060
The stick. Ready?

01:54.420 --> 01:58.820
Taylor, come on! Taylor?

02:04.860 --> 02:07.110
What do you smell?

02:12.060 --> 02:14.260
Did you find something?

02:18.900 --> 02:21.260
Look what he dug up this time.

02:23.350 --> 02:25.800
What is this?

02:51.550 --> 02:53.800
You have any idea what it could be?

02:53.810 --> 02:58.240
No. Probably belonged to the people who lived here before us.

02:58.540 --> 03:01.410
Come on. Breakfast is ready.

04:09.160 --> 04:12.750
Dad, this is Walter. He came by to talk to you.

04:12.760 --> 04:14.690
Hey, there, Danny.

04:14.940 --> 04:16.890
Erica, go inside.

04:17.519 --> 04:20.079
Why?
I said go inside.

04:23.230 --> 04:25.480
Tell that joke at school. Your friends will love it.

04:33.580 --> 04:35.400
Terrific kid.

04:35.410 --> 04:38.230
What you did to Claire Maddox was unforgivable.

04:38.240 --> 04:40.430
She tried to oust me from my own company.

04:40.440 --> 04:42.590
I didn't have much of a choice.

04:44.670 --> 04:48.390
By the way, I've always wondered, how is she in bed?

04:48.420 --> 04:51.740
I have nothing to say to you, asshole. Get off my property.

04:53.490 --> 04:54.740
We had a deal, Danny.

04:54.770 --> 04:58.950
And I held up my end of it. I perjured myself. I lied to ferc. You got your merger.

04:59.490 --> 05:04.200
Yeah, but then you shot your mouth off to Claire Maddox.

05:04.210 --> 05:06.760
You're killing people in West Virginia. That water is toxic.

05:06.770 --> 05:09.580
People get killed all the time, Danny.

05:09.600 --> 05:12.150
Just look at your wife.

05:16.030 --> 05:18.520
I want you to leave.

05:19.260 --> 05:22.680
Now's not the time to start feeling guilty. You want redemption?

05:22.690 --> 05:25.210
Go to church.

05:25.490 --> 05:30.670
Otherwise, quit your whining and keep your mouth shut.

05:37.230 --> 05:40.300
It was a real pleasure to meet Erica.

05:44.520 --> 05:49.960
I should tell you, Miss Parsons, a meeting like this is rather unusual.

05:49.970 --> 05:52.470
Ms. Hewes is grateful, your honor.

05:52.500 --> 05:55.140
What exactly are you asking me for?

05:55.150 --> 05:56.540
Reassurance.

05:56.570 --> 05:58.740
What kind of reassurance?

05:58.770 --> 06:02.610
Ms. Hewes is concerned the defense may object to some of our key evidence.

06:02.640 --> 06:06.140
She'd like to avoid any admissibility issues.

06:06.150 --> 06:08.460
I see.

06:08.760 --> 06:12.150
Based on past transactions and mutual concerns,

06:12.160 --> 06:16.790
Ms. Hewes is prepared to extend herself should the need arise.

06:17.870 --> 06:23.880
I'm sure you're aware that, uh, that kind of request is highly unethical.

06:29.140 --> 06:32.470
Well, let Patty know I'm flexible.

06:33.120 --> 06:36.210
Thank you. Your honor.

06:43.810 --> 06:48.430
Here's a list of the gps coordinates from
the cadillac Kendrick and Finn Garrety used.

06:48.470 --> 06:53.680
I sent 'em to a numbers guy I know in Princeton, but so far he's hit a wall.

06:55.060 --> 06:58.150
Hold it... oh, it's Deb. I got to take this.

06:58.160 --> 07:00.650
Hey, babe! How's it going?

07:01.050 --> 07:04.150
Oh, gee. I don't know.

07:04.160 --> 07:07.650
Is it safe to eat blue cheese when you're pregnant?

07:11.020 --> 07:14.150
Babe, why don't you call Dr. Stein. Yeah.

07:15.200 --> 07:17.950
Why did you eat blue cheese?

07:17.960 --> 07:20.420
I met with judge Oliver. You were right.

07:20.430 --> 07:21.610
I think he'll play ball.

07:21.640 --> 07:23.320
Did he try to grope you?

07:23.360 --> 07:25.630
He can be a very grabby old man.

07:25.670 --> 07:30.830
No, he was a perfect gentleman, except,
of course, his willingness to be bought.

07:31.130 --> 07:34.170
I told you this case is going to get ugly.

07:34.180 --> 07:38.090
But it's the only way we're going
to get those codes into evidence.

07:38.100 --> 07:40.410
If we break them.

07:43.360 --> 07:45.990
So, how are you doing?

07:46.420 --> 07:48.960
What do you mean?

07:48.990 --> 07:51.850
Everything that happened with Phil.

07:53.400 --> 07:55.880
I'd rather not talk about that.

07:57.320 --> 08:00.120
All right. I understand.

08:02.930 --> 08:05.150
Ellen.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.880
It's about trust.

08:09.890 --> 08:13.890
You can overlook someone's flaws, but, in the end...

08:14.910 --> 08:17.960
if you can't trust them...

08:17.970 --> 08:21.030
they're worthless.

08:25.030 --> 08:28.220
Thank you for helping me with the judge.

08:29.660 --> 08:33.100
That's what I'm here for.

08:38.260 --> 08:41.500
How the hell did we lose a cadillac?

08:43.039 --> 08:46.980
Dave, the car was stolen.

08:46.990 --> 08:52.240
So even if Patty Hewes somehow manages to figure out what's on the gps,

08:52.270 --> 08:55.340
it won't be admissible in court.

08:55.700 --> 08:58.630
What about your former lead counsel?

08:58.640 --> 09:03.890
Is she looking to remove the knife you stuck
in her back and slit your throat with it?

09:05.620 --> 09:08.200
She's still bound by privilege, Dave.

09:08.220 --> 09:12.470
So anything she learned while working
for unr can't be used against us.

09:12.490 --> 09:15.820
The law is on our side.

09:17.310 --> 09:20.030
You don't look worried enough.

09:20.050 --> 09:22.370
For what?

09:22.380 --> 09:25.670
I was a kid raised on food stamps.

09:25.680 --> 09:28.560
You know how I made so much money on wall street back in the day?

09:28.570 --> 09:29.540
How?

09:29.570 --> 09:33.500
Every day I'd wake up assuming I was going to lose it all.

09:33.530 --> 09:36.120
I'd go to work and make a pile more.

09:36.150 --> 09:39.870
See that? I always assume I'm going to win.

09:41.290 --> 09:44.270
I'm concerned about Daniel Purcell.

09:44.710 --> 09:47.480
If he's been sleeping with Maddox, he knows about everything.

09:47.510 --> 09:50.870
Purcell is in no position to make a move.

09:52.340 --> 09:56.930
It's over. I am not going to see her again. I am sorry!

09:58.260 --> 10:03.290
Please stop apologizing. You're a man. You cheat. I get it.

10:03.300 --> 10:06.840
But you got caught. You compromised me.

10:06.850 --> 10:09.620
I don't know what else to say.

10:11.550 --> 10:15.000
I've told you everything.
No, you haven't.

10:16.670 --> 10:19.340
You haven't told me everything.

10:26.430 --> 10:30.670
You bought stock in Ultima National Resources.

10:39.330 --> 10:41.920
These are confidential trades.

10:41.930 --> 10:43.040
How did you get this?

10:43.050 --> 10:45.130
That's not really the point, is it?

10:45.160 --> 10:47.380
You had me investigated?

10:47.390 --> 10:48.940
Don't change the subject.

10:48.970 --> 10:51.400
Well, you're changing the subject. We were talking about our marriage,

10:51.410 --> 10:55.190
and now you want to discuss my financial transactions. You...

10:57.000 --> 10:59.290
you had me investigated?

10:59.320 --> 11:02.900
UNR may very well have killed Daniel Purcell's wife.

11:02.940 --> 11:04.310
They are the enemy.

11:04.350 --> 11:07.060
And if you can prove any part of that, they will be punished.

11:07.100 --> 11:10.420
In the meantime, their stock was at an all-time low.

11:10.450 --> 11:11.470
That's your answer?

11:11.500 --> 11:13.730
That's what I do, Patty.

11:13.770 --> 11:16.000
You and I had an agreement.

11:16.020 --> 11:22.050
I don't get in your way, and you don't get in mine!

11:22.060 --> 11:25.030
You are my husband, and you bet against me.

11:25.050 --> 11:28.170
I bet against you? I told you the stock would go up.

11:28.180 --> 11:32.710
How many times did I warn you not to pursue the shareholder's case?

11:32.740 --> 11:34.870
How many times?

11:34.900 --> 11:37.090
Who tipped you off?

11:37.610 --> 11:40.180
Who told you to buy that stock?
That's not your concern.

11:40.190 --> 11:42.330
Not my concern?

11:42.340 --> 11:48.900
Whoever tipped you off about UNR was
using you to get me to drop the case.

11:49.380 --> 11:50.950
And how would you know that?

11:50.990 --> 11:56.040
Is it the same person who told you
I was being investigated by the FBI?

12:05.980 --> 12:08.140
Yes.

12:12.630 --> 12:15.150
So...

12:17.540 --> 12:21.600
twice, someone came to you,

12:21.610 --> 12:27.970
and twice, you advised me to drop the case.

12:33.100 --> 12:36.200
Tell me who it was.

12:40.060 --> 12:42.440
Tell me.

12:47.160 --> 12:49.460
Dave Pell.

12:51.280 --> 12:55.620
The same Dave Pell who put you up for energy secretary?

12:55.880 --> 12:58.280
Yeah.

12:59.070 --> 13:02.270
Who was in this apartment?

13:02.280 --> 13:05.280
Sharing my table with my friends?

13:05.290 --> 13:07.580
Yes.

13:09.110 --> 13:12.250
Get out.
Patty.

13:12.260 --> 13:15.530
I said get out.

13:17.200 --> 13:21.600
You see enemies everywhere, but you can't
see the people who actually care about you.

13:21.610 --> 13:24.670
Get the hell out!

13:26.560 --> 13:29.300
You'll be hearing from my divorce attorney.

13:29.870 --> 13:32.670
And I'll fight you. I will fight you.

13:32.680 --> 13:35.580
You think I'm going to roll over?

13:35.590 --> 13:38.190
Good luck.

13:53.950 --> 13:56.040
What are you doing here?

13:57.060 --> 13:59.910
I want to help.

14:03.320 --> 14:06.240
Kendrick came to my house.

14:06.250 --> 14:08.980
You need protection.

14:09.150 --> 14:12.620
I agreed to lie on the stand...

14:14.700 --> 14:18.330
but only if Kendrick would clean up aracite.

14:18.750 --> 14:21.330
They killed your wife.

14:21.360 --> 14:25.650
You were scared. You made a deal.

14:33.560 --> 14:36.420
I took money from them.

14:37.180 --> 14:43.400
I knew that if I quit my job, I would need resources to take care of Erica.

14:47.690 --> 14:52.260
Well, I... I appreciate you coming here,

14:52.620 --> 14:58.800
but you swore on the stand that aracite wasn't toxic, so...

14:59.540 --> 15:03.090
you're useless as a witness now.

15:03.780 --> 15:07.010
It's not just aracite.

15:07.460 --> 15:10.950
I've studied UNR's grid.

15:10.970 --> 15:15.850
Kendrick is intermittently shutting down power plants,

15:15.860 --> 15:19.370
limiting supply to drive up prices.

15:19.420 --> 15:21.470
You know the details?

15:21.520 --> 15:26.320
Kendrick must have an energy trader helping him make a fortune

15:26.330 --> 15:29.090
with the inside information.

15:29.100 --> 15:31.240
Finn Garrety.

15:31.260 --> 15:32.960
You know his name?

15:33.000 --> 15:38.180
The problem is I can't prove how Kendrick

15:38.190 --> 15:41.330
gets the information to Garrety.

15:43.550 --> 15:46.400
Is there anything I can do?

15:48.590 --> 15:51.360
How are you with codes?

15:53.830 --> 15:56.850
I think we passed through here already.

15:56.860 --> 15:59.020
Impossible.

15:59.030 --> 16:01.740
We didn't see those trees before?

16:02.330 --> 16:04.350
Never.

16:05.360 --> 16:08.080
Are you sure you know where we are?

16:08.270 --> 16:12.410
Absolutely. We're lost.

16:12.820 --> 16:14.890
Really?

16:15.850 --> 16:19.950
A little bit.
Finally. A little honesty.

16:21.670 --> 16:24.050
Your shoe's untied.

16:26.140 --> 16:28.870
See if there's a dirt path over there.

16:52.790 --> 16:57.590
I think we're more lost than you think we are. Jesus.

16:59.370 --> 17:02.410
Let's see what you can do outside the range.

17:04.480 --> 17:06.930
Shoot to kill.

17:22.910 --> 17:27.150
Damn. You're a killer.

17:27.160 --> 17:29.560
Two in the head, one in the heart.

17:31.870 --> 17:34.650
How does that feel?

17:34.680 --> 17:37.260
I'm not sure I like it.

17:51.840 --> 17:54.090
Damn it.

18:02.370 --> 18:04.600
What were we doing at the gala tonight?

18:04.640 --> 18:08.290
I needed to get my original aracite report back from Patty Hewes.

18:08.300 --> 18:09.960
Why?

18:09.980 --> 18:12.400
Because I'm not going to blow the whistle.

18:12.410 --> 18:15.810
I was worried about Erica's safety, and I made a deal.

18:16.660 --> 18:18.480
They're going to leave us alone now.

18:18.520 --> 18:20.790
You gave in to them.

18:29.430 --> 18:30.860
You sold out.

18:30.910 --> 18:33.090
Because I have to protect us.

18:33.130 --> 18:36.200
I have to protect our daughter.

18:36.210 --> 18:38.470
Dad?

18:38.980 --> 18:41.190
Dad?

18:42.550 --> 18:44.670
Are you okay?

18:45.000 --> 18:49.050
I'm fine. I'm just working.

18:50.640 --> 18:53.370
You should be in bed.

19:02.080 --> 19:04.540
Hi, mom.
This is a surprise.

19:04.550 --> 19:06.540
I'm going to jump in the shower.

19:06.550 --> 19:10.060
You haven't slept here one night this week.

19:10.820 --> 19:14.130
Michael, Jill is irresponsible for letting you stay with her.

19:14.150 --> 19:16.980
It is not a healthy relationship.

19:21.290 --> 19:23.870
You really want to do this?

19:23.890 --> 19:25.010
Excuse me?

19:25.040 --> 19:28.640
You really want to discuss responsibility?

19:28.650 --> 19:30.430
You and phil are getting a divorce.

19:30.450 --> 19:32.330
Who's responsible for that?

19:32.370 --> 19:33.930
Go take your shower.
No.

19:33.940 --> 19:36.410
Let's hear your thoughts on relationships.

19:36.460 --> 19:39.740
Why is it that you can't sustain one?

19:39.780 --> 19:42.450
Why do you hurt every person you come into contact with?

19:42.480 --> 19:44.120
Michael, stop it.

19:44.170 --> 19:47.390
Phil, uncle Pete, Ray Fiske.

19:47.440 --> 19:50.910
People either leave you or they die.

19:50.920 --> 19:54.570
Those are the only two endings possible with you.

19:55.770 --> 19:58.660
Who are you going to hurt next?

20:03.880 --> 20:07.130
I've been thinking, and I've made up my mind.

20:08.260 --> 20:10.920
You can't be the one.

20:12.320 --> 20:14.930
The one for what?

20:16.450 --> 20:19.640
To do the job with Judge Oliver.

20:20.900 --> 20:26.670
You're young and bright, and you have a
brilliant career ahead of you. You know that.

20:30.390 --> 20:35.080
Okay. Then, why are you pulling me off this?

20:35.930 --> 20:38.680
I'd just...

20:39.310 --> 20:42.180
feel better leaving you out of it.

20:42.200 --> 20:45.460
I don't need you to leave me out of it.

20:45.470 --> 20:49.410
When I came back to work here, I knew what I was getting into.

20:52.160 --> 20:55.250
I appreciate that, but I've made up my mind.

20:59.960 --> 21:03.060
Then, who is going to do it?

21:04.790 --> 21:08.030
It's best for you not to know.

21:18.710 --> 21:20.530
Patty shut me out.

21:20.560 --> 21:21.930
What do you mean?

21:21.970 --> 21:24.670
She's not going to use me to bribe the judge.

21:25.420 --> 21:28.460
She said she's trying to protect me.

21:28.840 --> 21:30.890
Do you believe her?

21:30.900 --> 21:33.770
Maybe I'm too close to her now.

21:33.780 --> 21:36.690
She actually seems to care about me.

21:38.420 --> 21:40.980
Either that or she's suspicious of you.

21:41.010 --> 21:44.960
Yeah, well, either way, now we won't know when she's going to make the bribe.

21:45.380 --> 21:47.650
I think she's going to use Tom instead.

21:47.700 --> 21:49.510
Why tom?

21:49.570 --> 21:52.160
He's the only one she'd trust.

21:52.170 --> 21:54.730
So we're going to have to get it from him.

21:55.160 --> 21:57.420
How?

21:58.300 --> 22:00.360
Arrest him.

22:02.340 --> 22:03.230
For what?

22:03.280 --> 22:05.730
For making a payoff in the infant mortality case.

22:05.760 --> 22:09.860
He didn't make a payoff. He walked away.

22:10.940 --> 22:13.690
Only we know that.

22:15.580 --> 22:21.050
You've already got him on tape arranging the
payoff and meeting Agent Hawkins with the money.

22:21.850 --> 22:25.340
It would be the FBI's word against Tom's.

22:25.350 --> 22:27.650
It's corruption, Ellen.

22:29.610 --> 22:32.630
Do we have a choice?

22:53.470 --> 22:56.000
Son of a bitch!

22:57.450 --> 23:00.740
Each entry has three two-digit numbers.

23:00.790 --> 23:04.130
The first number is the plant location,

23:04.140 --> 23:07.790
the second number is the time of day,

23:07.840 --> 23:13.540
third number is the day... of the week. Take a look.

23:14.700 --> 23:19.840
So, "01" is the first letter of the alphabet... a: Arkansas.

23:19.850 --> 23:25.100
The only state starting in a where Kendrick has a power plant.

23:25.110 --> 23:26.620
The second set of numbers?

23:26.660 --> 23:29.860
13 is in military time.

23:29.870 --> 23:35.220
So, that's 1:00 p.m. 04... Thursday... fourth day of the week.

23:35.230 --> 23:39.210
So, each entry corresponds to a brownout.

23:39.250 --> 23:45.080
Yes, and each brownout coincides with a futures trade made by...

23:47.580 --> 23:50.140
Finn Garrety.

23:57.820 --> 24:02.060
Daniel? This is good news.

24:03.860 --> 24:06.630
What's wrong?

24:20.000 --> 24:22.610
I understand.

24:27.510 --> 24:30.220
I'm sorry.

24:46.950 --> 24:48.730
Thank you for coming.

24:49.360 --> 24:51.400
My pleasure.

24:53.450 --> 24:55.910
I'm glad we can speak personally.

24:55.920 --> 24:59.350
I feel you... misunderstand me.

24:59.650 --> 25:04.380
If we sit and talk, I think you'll realize just how much we have in common.

25:04.960 --> 25:07.170
I'm sitting. You're talking.

25:09.620 --> 25:12.640
I read that magazine piece about you and your husband.

25:12.670 --> 25:15.180
Oh, yes?
Yeah.

25:15.190 --> 25:17.810
Sorry the son of a bitch cheated on you.

25:19.900 --> 25:21.850
But it was a nice article.

25:21.870 --> 25:24.820
Learned a lot of interesting things about you.

25:25.570 --> 25:27.970
Don't believe a word of it.

25:29.480 --> 25:32.230
My daddy worked the coal mines.

25:32.260 --> 25:35.890
Died of black lung at the ripe old age of 49.

25:36.700 --> 25:38.990
I'm sorry to hear that.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.850
Or maybe it was cirrhosis of the liver. Depends who you ask.

25:45.060 --> 25:47.680
So your point is that we both had humble beginnings?

25:47.710 --> 25:49.840
And we both made it to the top.

25:49.880 --> 25:51.840
I mean, look at us.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.620
Shouldn't we be able to settle our differences amicably?

25:58.570 --> 26:01.160
Yes, we should.

26:02.680 --> 26:06.290
So why don't you begin by answering a simple question.

26:08.410 --> 26:13.380
Was it your plan to manipulate the energy market?

26:15.270 --> 26:17.350
I believe in free markets, ms. Hewes.

26:17.360 --> 26:20.680
Or did dave pell bring you the idea?

26:26.340 --> 26:28.900
What's your price? Give me a number.

26:28.910 --> 26:34.570
This isn't about a number.
This is about aracite.

26:35.830 --> 26:41.900
I want you to clean it up, and I want you to compensate the victims.

26:43.150 --> 26:47.800
And I also want you to step down from Ultima National Resources.

26:49.680 --> 26:53.330
And I want a fairy godmother to make me all nice and pretty for the ball.

26:53.370 --> 26:57.000
Maybe you'll change your tune when I put
some gps coordinates in front of a judge.

26:57.040 --> 27:01.770
That evidence was stolen. It'll be inadmissible.

27:01.780 --> 27:06.120
So tell me, why do I feel so damn confident?

27:16.770 --> 27:20.840
Kendrick started talking settlement as soon as I mentioned Dave Pell.

27:20.850 --> 27:23.680
Really?
Who is Dave Pell?

27:23.690 --> 27:26.060
Well, mostly he's a power broker. I mean, he knows people.

27:26.070 --> 27:31.560
He makes introductions, facilitates deals, and then takes a cut for himself.

27:32.800 --> 27:35.530
Hold it. Sorry.

27:37.000 --> 27:42.890
Are you serious? Um, all right, I'm on... I'm own my way. I love you.

27:44.320 --> 27:46.330
Deb's five centimeters.

27:46.350 --> 27:48.920
So, how long since the last contraction?

27:49.450 --> 27:52.820
All right, well, just breathe, relax, and I'll meet you there, all right?

27:52.830 --> 27:55.850
I know. I love you so much, too. Okay.

27:59.370 --> 28:00.740
Tom Shayes?
Yeah?

28:00.750 --> 28:02.910
Hey, mind if we speak to you?
Yeah, yeah, I mind.

28:02.920 --> 28:04.250
I'm on my way to the hospital right now.

28:04.260 --> 28:06.490
Yeah, no, you're not.
No. My wife's... my wife's having a baby.

28:06.500 --> 28:07.890
Please come with me, sir.
No, she's having...

28:07.900 --> 28:10.470
she's in labor right now.
Sir, I ask you to come with me. Get in the car, please.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.820
My wife is having a baby right now!
Watch yourself. Watch your head.

28:12.830 --> 28:15.380
Watch your head, sir.

28:15.560 --> 28:18.770
I don't know what you want me to say. I didn't give her any money.

28:18.780 --> 28:20.720
She came into my office.
Miss Bryant?

28:20.730 --> 28:24.210
Yes. Yes. Monique Bryant.

28:24.590 --> 28:29.810
She told me if I wanted to represent her, I needed to front her $60,000.

28:29.830 --> 28:33.390
I told her absolutely not.

28:33.400 --> 28:35.640
Then why did you schedule a second meeting?

28:35.660 --> 28:37.900
I wanted to talk some sense into her.

28:37.940 --> 28:39.260
People go to jail for this.

28:39.310 --> 28:43.570
Tom, Monique Bryant is a federal agent.

28:43.600 --> 28:45.730
We were at the park when you met with her.

28:54.730 --> 28:56.160
Good, good.

28:56.200 --> 29:00.410
Then you know that I didn't give her
anything, and I just got up and I walked away.

29:03.020 --> 29:05.410
Then...

29:05.420 --> 29:07.640
how do you explain this?

29:08.170 --> 29:14.830
I feel terrible asking you to do this, but $60,000 is going to save my life.

29:17.320 --> 29:23.410
Well, I'm... I'm, uh, happy to help. I'm going to give you this,

29:24.050 --> 29:28.360
but it's imperative that you understand you can never talk about this.

29:33.330 --> 29:35.400
Is that your voice?

29:38.220 --> 29:42.340
Yes. But I didn't give her a dime.

29:44.400 --> 29:46.900
Agent Hawkins?

29:53.120 --> 29:55.680
He says he didn't pay you anything.

29:55.690 --> 30:00.480
Got it right here. 60 grand. In cash.

30:00.490 --> 30:03.580
That is bullshit. I... you know that I... I
never gave that to you, you know that.

30:03.590 --> 30:05.540
All right, Tom.
I never gave that to her.

30:05.550 --> 30:06.590
Start from the beginning.

30:06.630 --> 30:08.730
No, listen to me, goddamn it.

30:08.740 --> 30:10.960
Get me a lawyer right now.

30:10.990 --> 30:16.910
You deny me this, God help you if this conversation goes a minute further.

30:19.730 --> 30:24.690
Fine. We've got an attorney for you.

30:37.830 --> 30:39.210
How long have you been lying to my face?

30:39.240 --> 30:41.090
This isn't about you; it's about Patty.

30:41.110 --> 30:43.440
Patty is me. We're partners.

30:43.450 --> 30:46.990
She goes down, the firm goes down.
She's a criminal.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.480
We know she's planning to use you to bribe Judge Oliver.

30:49.510 --> 30:52.560
Oh, Jesus Christ, I can't believe this is happening.

30:52.580 --> 30:54.650
All right, uh, uh, let me call my goddamn wife.

30:54.670 --> 30:56.170
I don't even know if she's got to the hospital.

30:56.210 --> 30:59.400
I called. She's fine.

31:01.710 --> 31:05.610
Oh, my God. How can you live with yourself?

31:05.620 --> 31:08.400
If you want this to be over, it can.

31:08.410 --> 31:10.720
They have all the information they need to send you to jail.

31:10.750 --> 31:12.800
I didn't do it, okay? I didn't make the goddamn payoff.

31:12.810 --> 31:16.250
That's irrelevant. How are you going to explain that tape in court?

31:16.530 --> 31:19.570
It's their word against yours.

31:19.580 --> 31:21.910
Screw Patty.

31:22.310 --> 31:25.700
You have some bullshit idea of loyalty. Trust me, she doesn't.

31:25.710 --> 31:28.440
Everything I have, I have because of Patty.

31:28.490 --> 31:32.680
If she were in your position, tell me
she wouldn't give you up in a heartbeat.

31:34.470 --> 31:39.140
Patty's going down anyway, Tom. Save yourself.

31:40.290 --> 31:42.860
I'm trying to help you.

31:43.790 --> 31:46.550
Just give them what they want.

31:56.630 --> 31:59.650
Nice work. You got him to wear a wire.

32:00.180 --> 32:03.150
Yeah, but he'll say anything now to see his wife.

32:04.170 --> 32:07.130
I don't think we can trust him to go through with it.

32:07.160 --> 32:09.220
Then what do you suggest?

32:09.270 --> 32:13.840
Tell him you'll make it all go away if he refuses to make the bribe.

32:14.300 --> 32:17.330
Then Patty will be forced to use me.

32:22.950 --> 32:26.220
It's important to me that the two of you meet.

32:27.360 --> 32:32.090
I'm excited. All these years, I never knew I had a half-sister.

32:33.540 --> 32:37.340
I want you to know I did try to be in your life, Michael.

32:40.100 --> 32:41.640
What do you mean?

32:41.670 --> 32:45.110
When you were seven, your mother told me about you.

32:48.500 --> 32:54.010
We fought... over custody, and we went to court.

32:54.020 --> 32:56.440
It got ugly...

32:58.370 --> 33:01.390
and eventually, I backed down.

33:01.400 --> 33:05.190
I'm sure my mom was pretty vicious.

33:05.200 --> 33:10.160
She was fiercely protective of you.

33:15.310 --> 33:18.140
I'm sorry I never met your wife.

33:19.780 --> 33:23.550
Do you really think that company had her killed?

33:25.840 --> 33:27.330
You sold out.

33:27.360 --> 33:31.340
Because I have to protect us.
I have to protect our daughter.

33:31.350 --> 33:36.930
Bullshit! For years you have been
telling me that you don't want this life.

33:36.940 --> 33:41.590
Well, you know something? That is bullshit because you do want it!

33:42.170 --> 33:46.060
You want your houses and you want that lawyer you're screwing.

33:46.070 --> 33:49.530
I don't give a shit about any of it.
Shut up!

33:49.990 --> 33:54.300
If you don't stop them, I will.

33:54.310 --> 33:55.650
I can't let you do that.

33:55.690 --> 33:57.910
I'm going to call the EPA.

33:58.720 --> 34:01.650
No, you won't.
Oh, yes, I will.

34:06.330 --> 34:09.590
Stop. Don't come any closer.

34:09.600 --> 34:12.820
Stay right where you are. I swear to god.

34:20.120 --> 34:23.449
Wayne, I need to talk to you.

34:23.480 --> 34:26.130
We made an arrangement. You'd better not be backing out.

34:26.139 --> 34:29.949
I'm not. I need...

34:33.480 --> 34:35.670
What, Mr. Purcell?

34:36.179 --> 34:38.900
We're in trouble.

34:40.230 --> 34:42.250
Dad.

34:46.610 --> 34:49.280
Erica. This is Michael.

34:49.290 --> 34:51.560
Hi, my dad's told me all about you.

34:51.570 --> 34:54.060
It's great to meet you.

34:54.820 --> 34:58.200
I told Michael I have to go into the city for some business.

34:58.950 --> 35:01.860
He thought it might be nice for the two of you to hang out while I'm gone.

35:01.870 --> 35:03.750
Sure.

35:04.230 --> 35:07.620
Why don't you introduce him to grandma and grandpa?
Okay.

35:13.140 --> 35:15.460
So do you have any plans for the afternoon?

35:15.490 --> 35:17.880
I have to finish my geometry.

35:17.890 --> 35:20.250
Need some help?
Sure.

35:22.070 --> 35:26.980
Meet Charles Kurtwood Shayes.

35:31.320 --> 35:35.290
I'm so thrilled for you. Congratulations.
Thank you.

35:37.350 --> 35:40.660
Uh, Patty, w... we have to talk about something.

35:40.670 --> 35:43.040
Okay.

35:43.920 --> 35:48.610
Uh, this thing with Judge Oliver...

35:49.670 --> 35:51.860
Yeah?

35:52.380 --> 35:54.860
I can't do it.

35:54.870 --> 35:57.160
Excuse me?

35:57.170 --> 36:00.220
I'm sure... I'm sure you can understand why.

36:03.740 --> 36:08.420
You've been a father for ten years,
and it's never stopped you before.

36:08.430 --> 36:12.850
But this time... it's different.

36:13.870 --> 36:18.180
I can't do it, and I don't think you should either.

36:19.430 --> 36:22.020
Really?

36:31.090 --> 36:34.160
I'm sorry, but I've made my decision.

36:35.640 --> 36:38.030
I should have seen this coming.
Patty.

36:38.040 --> 36:40.660
I've always known that you would let me down.

36:41.230 --> 36:44.020
Don't pull that bullshit on me, Patty.

36:44.050 --> 36:47.090
Why did I trust you? You're not cut out for this.

36:47.100 --> 36:51.190
I can't do it, okay? Please, I just... I... just this once,

36:51.200 --> 36:55.580
I... I cannot do it.
I understand! I understand!

36:59.840 --> 37:01.650
So...

37:04.930 --> 37:07.630
leave.

37:09.190 --> 37:12.420
You're fired.

37:50.970 --> 37:53.290
Where are you?
Heading home.

37:53.790 --> 37:55.270
Is it done?

37:55.310 --> 37:57.800
I'm going to have to try again.

37:57.810 --> 38:00.820
You'd better.
I'll keep you posted.

38:14.840 --> 38:16.440
Ellen.

38:16.450 --> 38:19.040
Wes. What's going on?

38:19.050 --> 38:21.880
Ah, they're doing some work at my building. It's...

38:21.890 --> 38:24.000
do you mind if I crash here a night?

38:24.830 --> 38:28.560
Sure.
Or two? Maybe three.

38:29.230 --> 38:31.370
Well, let's just see how the first one goes.

38:31.410 --> 38:33.920
I can live with that.
Okay.

38:44.360 --> 38:46.260
Yeah, you got Kendrick.

38:47.110 --> 38:48.590
This is Daniel Purcell.

38:48.620 --> 38:51.640
Hey, Danny, good to hear from you.

38:52.210 --> 38:56.100
I've been thinking a lot about god.

38:56.930 --> 39:00.340
Heaven and hell.
Yeah? Don't waste your time.

39:00.710 --> 39:03.780
God gave up on both of us a long time ago.

39:05.200 --> 39:10.050
The nine circles of hell are for the unrepentant

39:10.070 --> 39:12.580
who try to justify their sins.

39:12.610 --> 39:16.820
I'm a businessman, Daniel. I don't give a shit about fire and brimstone.

39:16.830 --> 39:22.550
Everyone in hell has knowledge of the past and the future,

39:23.340 --> 39:25.600
but not of the present.

39:25.640 --> 39:31.080
It's a twisted joke because after the final judgment, time ends...

39:32.490 --> 39:38.280
and all of us... burning in hell...

39:40.030 --> 39:42.680
will know nothing...

39:43.870 --> 39:46.380
for all eternity.

39:47.230 --> 39:50.180
You're out of your mind.

40:14.270 --> 40:16.620
Detective Victor Huntley, please.

40:16.630 --> 40:19.060
What is this in regard to?

40:19.070 --> 40:23.800
The murder of Christine Purcell.

40:37.160 --> 40:40.410
No...

40:40.420 --> 40:46.670
no... no, no! No!

40:51.650 --> 40:54.740
Christine?

40:55.400 --> 40:57.640
Christine?

40:57.650 --> 41:01.780
No, no! No!

41:01.790 --> 41:07.820
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

41:13.850 --> 41:16.830
Homicide.
You'd better get down here.

41:17.900 --> 41:20.800
I think we may have a problem on our hands.

41:21.760 --> 41:25.060
Does he know what really happened that night?

41:30.370 --> 41:32.220
What is it?

41:32.240 --> 41:35.830
We have a situation, Mr. Kendrick. Daniel Purcell just killed his wife.

41:36.180 --> 41:38.900
What?
Yeah, and he's asking for help.

41:38.910 --> 41:41.480
I'm worried we'll lose him if we don't clean this up.

41:42.840 --> 41:46.010
All right, you know who to call.

41:46.040 --> 41:48.740
Make it look like a robbery.

41:55.430 --> 41:58.810
Do you want my help?
Yes.

42:19.510 --> 42:21.340
Mr. Kendrick.

42:21.370 --> 42:24.580
Is everything taken care of?
Not yet.

42:24.590 --> 42:26.500
Why not?

42:28.580 --> 42:31.410
She's still alive.

42:32.960 --> 42:36.590
Jesus christ. What a goddamn mess.

42:36.960 --> 42:39.740
What do you want me to do?

42:42.060 --> 42:45.180
Finish it.
Okay.

43:14.700 --> 43:16.950
Help me.

43:18.790 --> 43:21.310
Sure.

43:28.710 --> 43:31.250
Tell him I killed my wife.

43:33.050 --> 43:35.390
I killed my wife.

43:36.305 --> 43:42.613
