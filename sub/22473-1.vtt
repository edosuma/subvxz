The song So-yool just sang...

03:26.011 --> 03:29.288

03:29.982 --> 03:31.689
It's difficult to sing.

03:32.117 --> 03:35.394
And demands the listener
to have noble ears.

03:35.888 --> 03:39.700
Historically, those with tasteful ears...

It's an important performance.

19:46.291 --> 19:47.827
What time is it at?

19:48.226 --> 19:49.226
6 o'clock.

19:50.795 --> 19:54.299
I'll bring you back here by 5 PM!

19:56.134 --> 19:57.134
Okay?

19:58.369 --> 20:01.350
- Whose car is this?
- A friend's.

20:01.606 --> 20:03.882
- Where are we going?
- To meet a friend.

20:04.442 --> 20:06.388
- Where?
- A friend's house.

20:07.412 --> 20:08.823
Hey!

20:16.855 --> 20:19.699
- Where is this?
- A friend's house.

20:27.866 --> 20:30.608
Madam LEE Nan-young?

20:35.440 --> 20:36.907
Uncomfortable with me?

20:36.908 --> 20:37.978
No!

20:38.576 --> 20:40.522
Of course not!

20:41.079 --> 20:44.822
I really respect you, madam.

20:49.921 --> 20:50.921
So-yool?

20:50.955 --> 20:53.629
I'm just a pop music singer.

20:53.925 --> 20:58.135
I should respect you.
You're a master traditional singer.

20:58.363 --> 21:02.072
Oh no! Please...

21:02.967 --> 21:04.412
My singing is still...

21:04.969 --> 21:07.142
What a pretty darling?

21:07.238 --> 21:08.649
Like peach blossom?

21:08.706 --> 21:11.744
Right! Peach blossom.

21:11.910 --> 21:14.083
Title, 'Peach Blossom'!

21:14.679 --> 21:17.159
The song will be about you.

21:17.382 --> 21:20.920
His muse was you, So-yool?
I'm not surprised.

21:20.985 --> 21:23.693
I love all the songs he made.

21:25.156 --> 21:26.156
Songs?

21:26.457 --> 21:27.663
You didn't know?

21:28.126 --> 21:31.505
He was famous even while in Japan.

21:32.697 --> 21:34.643
Don't tell my mom.

21:35.133 --> 21:38.171
He wrote one of my songs
too, 'Spring Dream'.

21:40.171 --> 21:42.515
'Spring Dream'?

21:43.207 --> 21:46.176
- That's made by CHOI Chi-rim.
- Right!

21:46.177 --> 21:48.919
That's Mr. KIM's alias.

21:54.652 --> 21:58.532
If I tell you who I'm with,
you'll be shocked!

21:58.823 --> 22:00.166
Can you come now?

22:00.458 --> 22:01.458
Now?

22:06.431 --> 22:10.267
Thank you for agreeing to
my sudden request.

22:10.268 --> 22:14.876
Why of course! I always welcome my fans.

22:14.939 --> 22:18.944
Will you do me a favor in return?

22:19.477 --> 22:21.678
Of course! Anything.

22:21.679 --> 22:23.818
Sing me a traditional song?

22:24.082 --> 22:26.153
Oh please.

22:26.217 --> 22:28.163
I love traditional songs.

22:28.219 --> 22:30.995
Could you sing for me?

22:32.323 --> 22:37.323

22:49.507 --> 22:55.185

22:56.614 --> 22:58.218
How can you be so senseless?

22:58.282 --> 23:00.283
Have you lost your mind?

23:00.284 --> 23:04.232
I thought you were quietly
getting ready in your room!

23:04.288 --> 23:08.065
You have to get your hair and makeup done!

23:08.159 --> 23:09.194
What time is it?

23:09.260 --> 23:12.173
Damn! I forgot my watch.

23:18.236 --> 23:19.579
You stay here.

23:19.904 --> 23:22.748
What? I don't want to stay alone.

23:22.807 --> 23:25.686
Take care of Yeon-hee.

23:26.210 --> 23:27.210
Sure.

23:29.380 --> 23:30.415
Let's.

23:32.016 --> 23:33.016
Take care!

23:42.527 --> 23:44.905
- Go inside.
- What?

23:45.163 --> 23:47.370
You're a fan, right? Go in.

24:10.521 --> 24:13.297
Japanese police commissioner,
Hirata Kiyoshi.

24:13.925 --> 24:18.999
He's famous for being cruel,
but has an appreciation for the arts.

24:22.200 --> 24:25.374
You must gain his heart.

25:53.891 --> 25:55.370
Did you enjoy it, sir?

25:56.627 --> 25:57.627
Yes.

25:58.095 --> 26:01.440
Her mother was a famous master singer too.

26:16.514 --> 26:18.994
Joseon's traditional song?

26:19.584 --> 26:21.757
It's called, 'Ujo Pyeonggeo', sir.

26:22.787 --> 26:24.767
Do you know Japan's 'Joruri'?

26:25.623 --> 26:28.570
I've heard the 'Yokyoku'...

26:29.260 --> 26:30.933
But 'Joruri' is uncommon.

26:31.429 --> 26:36.139
It'd be an honor to hear it some day.

26:43.374 --> 26:44.375
This way.

26:53.050 --> 26:56.429
After your bath, change into this.

27:00.391 --> 27:03.133
You have an appreciation for the arts.

27:03.794 --> 27:06.741
And you think dearly of artists.

27:07.865 --> 27:13.315
So I humbly performed for you.

27:16.941 --> 27:19.444
That is all I have to offer, sir.

27:20.444 --> 27:22.720
I didn't prepare for anything else.

27:40.498 --> 27:46.744
You said artists are flowers
that can't be plucked.

27:46.837 --> 27:52.287
Do you know why artists are called flowers?

27:54.845 --> 27:57.849
Flowers get plucked and put in vases.

27:58.215 --> 28:01.253
They are for getting plucked
by men who want them.

28:02.086 --> 28:04.066
That is an artist!

28:06.324 --> 28:12.900
Then I'm basically a prostitute?

28:15.499 --> 28:20.107
How dare you say that!

28:32.350 --> 28:33.988
What are you doing here?

28:35.619 --> 28:36.757
Honey!

28:37.988 --> 28:41.993
I waited all last night.
What took you so long?

28:43.094 --> 28:44.198
It's nothing.

28:45.830 --> 28:47.241
I'm hungry.

28:51.702 --> 28:55.514
What about school?
You're really going to quit?

28:56.474 --> 28:58.954
I already quit a long time ago.

28:59.510 --> 29:02.787
Your mother will be disappointed.

29:03.914 --> 29:06.292
There's no end to Mom's greed.

29:06.784 --> 29:10.527
She wouldn't be satisfied even
if I become Governor-General.

29:15.659 --> 29:16.659
So-yool.

29:17.361 --> 29:22.333
In a world like this,
being successful is a sin.

29:23.100 --> 29:27.640
As you go up the ladder,
you trample on our people.

29:28.239 --> 29:35.453
Isn't it better to make songs
that comfort this country?

29:41.552 --> 29:45.295
Promise you'll sing my song?

29:46.257 --> 29:48.794
I can't be a pop singer.

29:48.959 --> 29:51.795
Think pop music is lowly?

29:51.796 --> 29:55.073
Of course I don't.

29:56.634 --> 29:59.240
I just love traditional songs.

29:59.537 --> 30:01.039
But So-yool...

30:01.672 --> 30:08.112
Think even one person there
will ever get to hear you sing?

30:08.212 --> 30:11.557
They don't have the right
or the ears to hear it?

30:11.882 --> 30:12.883
Fine.

30:13.317 --> 30:16.093
Maybe your Mother is right.

30:17.221 --> 30:22.068
But they don't need songs
to idly appreciate.

30:22.193 --> 30:26.972
What they need
are tears and laughter.

30:27.498 --> 30:31.469
I'm going to make
a national song of our time.

30:32.636 --> 30:35.845
A song for the tired
and weary hearts of Joseon.

30:36.674 --> 30:41.680
A song made complete
when sung by the people.

30:48.252 --> 30:49.253
I forgot.

31:05.169 --> 31:07.615
Madam LEE Nan-young's concert?

31:08.606 --> 31:11.450
She especially invited you.

31:12.977 --> 31:15.048
I'll go with Yeon-hee.

31:15.613 --> 31:17.183
Thank you so much!

31:22.219 --> 31:23.254
I'll go.

31:28.526 --> 31:29.698
Yoon-woo!

31:33.130 --> 31:36.373
I love traditional songs.

31:37.101 --> 31:40.275
But I really want to sing your song.

31:43.240 --> 31:47.689
And if I could...

31:52.216 --> 31:55.891
I want to be Joseon's heart.

32:48.439 --> 32:52.945
And I'm so happy to share my songs
with my special guests.

32:53.277 --> 32:57.817
A few days ago,
I happened to hear a lady sing.

32:58.415 --> 33:01.225
It was literally music to my ears.

33:01.585 --> 33:03.319
It was so good...

33:03.320 --> 33:05.266
I couldn't sleep all night.

33:05.689 --> 33:10.035
Music can touch and stir people's souls.

33:11.595 --> 33:14.838
She made me realize
the joy of singing again.

33:16.367 --> 33:18.210
And she's here tonight.

33:20.671 --> 33:22.480
Will you sing for us?

33:23.707 --> 33:25.618
Let's give her a big welcome!

Yeon-hee!

36:23.053 --> 36:24.259
Did you go somewhere?

36:24.655 --> 36:25.895
Yes.

36:28.959 --> 36:31.599
About your boyfriend...

36:32.629 --> 36:33.869
Yoon-woo?

36:33.964 --> 36:34.964
Yes.

36:35.699 --> 36:38.873
He's a bit strange.

36:39.369 --> 36:41.280
He asked me to make an album.

36:42.806 --> 36:45.650
- He asked you?
- Yes.

36:45.809 --> 36:49.382
He said he's CHOI Chi-rim,
who wrote 'Spring Dream'.

36:51.281 --> 36:52.624
What did you say?

36:53.750 --> 36:54.421
What?

36:54.484 --> 36:57.465
Did you say you'll do it?

37:01.825 --> 37:03.827
It's true?

37:05.028 --> 37:07.975
I found an amazing singer.

37:08.765 --> 37:10.867
But she won't make an album.

37:10.868 --> 37:14.441
Why? Who doesn't want to?
Did you say I'll produce it?

37:14.504 --> 37:18.646
She said no before I could explain.

37:19.443 --> 37:22.185
She is so stubborn.

37:22.880 --> 37:23.881
Man...

37:24.047 --> 37:27.153
Women are all the same. They only see me!

But I'm the top songwriter in Joseon!

39:26.103 --> 39:28.310
KIM Yoon-woo! No, CHOI Chi-rim!

39:28.672 --> 39:31.653
To make an album,
I'll have to leave Daesung.

39:31.808 --> 39:33.082
That's the reason?

39:33.143 --> 39:37.091
You'll make more money with the album.

39:37.314 --> 39:40.818
It's not that.
So-yool and I made a promise.

39:41.385 --> 39:44.628
To keep the honor
and live as artists for life.

39:45.055 --> 39:47.501
What damn honor of artists?

39:47.824 --> 39:49.826
So-yool and I are artists.

39:51.428 --> 39:53.101
Don't insult us.

39:55.298 --> 39:57.141
Look, Ms. SEO.

40:01.671 --> 40:04.311
How can an artist's son insult an artist?

40:06.543 --> 40:08.250
I'm not slighting artists.

40:09.613 --> 40:11.559
But artists' performances...

40:12.349 --> 40:16.024
are for gluttons who waste
money on a night of drinks.

40:17.854 --> 40:20.232
Whether you like it or not...

40:21.992 --> 40:24.302
your voice belongs to...

40:25.829 --> 40:29.504
the merchants, rickshaw drivers,
and even beggars.

40:31.868 --> 40:35.839
A voice that should belong to everyone!

40:38.775 --> 40:41.187
That's what must be Joseon's heart.

40:44.648 --> 40:46.559
Should it not?

41:17.714 --> 41:22.857
I must become a singer.

41:28.225 --> 41:30.205
Mr. KIM explained.

41:32.095 --> 41:37.067
That my voice must be Joseon's heart.

41:42.339 --> 41:43.477
So-yool!

41:44.207 --> 41:45.481
So-yool!

42:13.737 --> 42:14.738
So-yool?

42:14.804 --> 42:17.307
Why is it Yeon-hee and not me?

42:20.110 --> 42:20.781
Come inside.

42:20.844 --> 42:22.790
Why Yeon-hee?

42:23.380 --> 42:24.450
I'm sorry.

42:26.349 --> 42:31.059
But I need Yeon-hee for my song.

42:33.490 --> 42:34.992
Come in.

42:37.127 --> 42:38.128
So-yool.

42:43.900 --> 42:45.470
It's because...

42:45.702 --> 42:48.649
you didn't hear me sing.

42:49.005 --> 42:50.985
I only sang traditional songs.

42:51.141 --> 42:54.088

I've never had anyone in my heart but you.

44:02.345 --> 44:03.983
It'll always be you.

44:06.283 --> 44:09.389
My love won't change. Okay?

44:12.322 --> 44:13.665
I know.

44:13.723 --> 44:15.930
Then why are you crying?

44:17.060 --> 44:22.009
Because... I want to sing your song too.

44:27.737 --> 44:34.313

45:20.023 --> 45:24.995
Because they fade away in time.

45:27.597 --> 45:33.013
Remember that once you leave,
you cannot come back.

46:49.712 --> 46:53.319
Why don't you try writing the lyrics?

46:53.783 --> 46:55.729

46:57.153 --> 46:59.224

I think the second one

Yeon-hee?

48:06.623 --> 48:11.623
I liked the last one.
I felt most comfortable.

48:11.728 --> 48:15.301
It sounds a bit heavy.

48:15.932 --> 48:19.744
Like the song demands to feel something.

48:20.470 --> 48:22.882

49:50.526 --> 49:52.301
They won't take us either?

49:53.262 --> 49:55.640
I'm doomed.

49:55.698 --> 49:58.645

01:12:23.812 --> 01:12:25.587
We're done.

01:12:27.015 --> 01:12:29.655
Hey!

01:12:30.185 --> 01:12:31.596
Stop!

01:12:31.653 --> 01:12:33.454
What's with you?

01:12:33.455 --> 01:12:35.756
You really don't know?

01:12:35.757 --> 01:12:37.358
Snap out of it!

01:12:37.359 --> 01:12:38.804
How many did we make?

01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:44.403
Minus what the commissioner bought,
we sold just 200 albums!

01:12:44.499 --> 01:12:50.211
But she's the commissioner's girl.
We have to do it.

01:12:50.705 --> 01:12:53.686
I'm sorry, Ms. JUNG,
but this is not for you.

01:12:53.742 --> 01:12:57.690
Just sing traditional songs!

01:13:03.251 --> 01:13:04.251
So-yool...

01:13:04.386 --> 01:13:06.832
I hope you understand.

01:13:06.888 --> 01:13:09.767
He's good, but quite stubborn.

01:13:10.759 --> 01:13:12.739
Find a new songwriter.

01:13:12.827 --> 01:13:15.603
His songs didn't suit me from the start.

01:13:15.663 --> 01:13:17.643
But we don't have time.

01:13:18.033 --> 01:13:23.033
Could you change your singing method a bit?

01:13:23.138 --> 01:13:24.549
Singing method?

01:13:26.708 --> 01:13:30.417
How should I change my singing method?

01:13:30.478 --> 01:13:33.425
For instance...

01:13:34.349 --> 01:13:38.229
Like SEO Yeon-hee! You should know her.

01:13:38.286 --> 01:13:41.388
Her album is selling like crazy
in the black market.

01:13:41.389 --> 01:13:44.358
People love the way SEO Yeon-hee sings!

01:13:44.359 --> 01:13:49.809
But her album was rejected
due to poor singing method.

01:13:54.102 --> 01:13:56.139
Bring me KIM Yoon-woo.

Don't mind him. Let's drink!

KIM Yoon-woo, the songwriter...

01:18:30.745 --> 01:18:33.954
He's in a predicament.

01:18:34.382 --> 01:18:39.195
He beat a Japanese soldier.
He'll rot in jail for years.

01:19:13.788 --> 01:19:15.734
Wait just a bit.

01:19:16.557 --> 01:19:17.558
I promise...

01:19:18.226 --> 01:19:20.228
I'll find you a way out.

01:19:25.099 --> 01:19:26.544
Yeon-hee...

01:19:28.803 --> 01:19:30.783
How is she?

01:19:37.512 --> 01:19:40.493
I have something to tell you.

01:19:42.083 --> 01:19:44.063
There's no time for this.

01:19:44.385 --> 01:19:45.193
So-yool...

01:19:45.253 --> 01:19:46.527
First...

01:19:47.555 --> 01:19:50.001
We have to get you out.

01:20:09.877 --> 01:20:11.220
So-yool!

01:20:12.213 --> 01:20:14.022
Good thing we met.

01:20:14.081 --> 01:20:16.118
Come with me.

01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:19.821
This way.

01:20:23.891 --> 01:20:26.895
Give this to Yoon-woo or Yeon-hee?

01:20:27.261 --> 01:20:28.035
What's this?

01:20:28.095 --> 01:20:30.837
Their passports and visas to Italy.

01:20:30.898 --> 01:20:35.001
He said he'll take Yeon-hee
to study in Italy, so I got them.

01:20:35.002 --> 01:20:37.710
But they're both nowhere to be found.

01:20:39.273 --> 01:20:41.378
They're leaving?

01:20:41.776 --> 01:20:44.313
You didn't know?

01:20:45.413 --> 01:20:49.449
Anyway, tell Yoon-woo
that I'm hiding from creditors.

01:20:49.450 --> 01:20:50.450
Okay?

01:20:50.585 --> 01:20:52.565
Thanks, So-yool! Bye!

01:20:57.258 --> 01:20:58.737
Don't come anymore.

01:21:00.461 --> 01:21:04.739
Tell Hong-seok what
happened, and stop coming.

01:21:07.468 --> 01:21:08.606
Why?

01:21:13.841 --> 01:21:16.321
Because I'm nothing to you?

01:21:17.378 --> 01:21:21.724
Because you're planning
to leave with Yeon-hee?

01:21:23.551 --> 01:21:24.551
Yes.

01:21:30.024 --> 01:21:31.526
What about me?

01:21:34.529 --> 01:21:35.906
You promised.

01:21:38.299 --> 01:21:39.903
You swore...

01:21:42.169 --> 01:21:43.477
Please don't do this.

01:21:51.612 --> 01:21:53.614
Change your mind.

01:21:54.549 --> 01:21:56.392
Since it's so easy.

01:21:57.118 --> 01:21:59.997
You can change your heart again.

01:22:36.057 --> 01:22:38.128
JUNG SO-YOOL
SPRING ROMANCE

01:22:45.633 --> 01:22:47.237
I have a favor to ask.

01:22:48.135 --> 01:22:51.446
He insulted the Imperial army.

01:22:52.573 --> 01:22:55.611
He must fill his sentence.

01:22:58.846 --> 01:23:00.291
Please...

01:23:01.749 --> 01:23:03.729
Lock him up for good.

01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:08.163
So he can't meet anyone.

01:23:39.186 --> 01:23:40.290
Yeon-hee.

01:23:41.155 --> 01:23:43.726
Sorry. Did you wait long?

01:23:43.791 --> 01:23:44.326
No.

01:23:44.625 --> 01:23:46.332
The recording took long.

01:23:47.995 --> 01:23:49.474
I heard your songs.

01:23:49.630 --> 01:23:51.337
Congratulations. Really.

01:23:51.599 --> 01:23:52.600
Thanks.

01:23:55.803 --> 01:23:57.077
So-yool.

01:23:59.073 --> 01:24:01.849
Have you heard from Yoon-woo?

01:24:05.312 --> 01:24:07.485
You call him Yoon-woo now?

01:24:11.819 --> 01:24:12.820
Silly.

01:24:13.921 --> 01:24:17.528
Who is he that you couldn't come to me?

01:24:18.826 --> 01:24:20.134
So-yool...

01:24:21.595 --> 01:24:23.802
I'm sure he's doing fine.

01:24:25.733 --> 01:24:27.644
I'm more worried about you.

01:24:31.505 --> 01:24:32.848
Yeon-hee.

01:24:33.641 --> 01:24:34.984
Yoon-woo...

01:24:36.310 --> 01:24:37.812
Don't trust him too much.

01:24:40.514 --> 01:24:42.460
But I trust him.

01:24:44.151 --> 01:24:48.725
He said he'll find a way
for us to be together.

01:24:50.157 --> 01:24:52.398
He must be still searching.

01:24:55.563 --> 01:24:57.634
If you hear anything, let me know.

01:24:58.532 --> 01:24:59.943
Of course.

01:25:02.703 --> 01:25:06.082
You can still make an album without him.

01:25:06.273 --> 01:25:07.479
I'll help you.

01:25:09.643 --> 01:25:11.623
Thank you.

01:25:12.646 --> 01:25:16.719
But I can't. I don't have a permit.

01:25:17.718 --> 01:25:18.718
Really?

01:25:19.453 --> 01:25:21.330
So-yool...

01:25:22.089 --> 01:25:25.901
Is there anywhere I can sing?

01:25:27.094 --> 01:25:29.096
I'm dying to sing.

01:25:39.273 --> 01:25:42.447
How do you know JUNG So-yool?

01:25:43.544 --> 01:25:45.820
We're best friends.

01:25:46.313 --> 01:25:48.623
Best friends, huh?

01:25:49.283 --> 01:25:51.889
It makes sense.

01:25:53.387 --> 01:25:56.493
At least you get paid a lot.

01:25:58.425 --> 01:26:00.371
Thumb print here.

01:26:00.728 --> 01:26:01.729
But...

01:26:02.663 --> 01:26:05.769
What is a 'Government
General special singer'?

01:26:05.866 --> 01:26:07.607
You came without knowing?

01:26:08.169 --> 01:26:10.672
Literally, a 'special' singer.

01:26:13.073 --> 01:26:14.450
Go on.

01:26:52.713 --> 01:26:53.987
You're pretty.

01:26:54.081 --> 01:26:55.856
She suits you!

01:26:56.417 --> 01:26:58.055
Drink up!

01:27:27.381 --> 01:27:28.451
Why?

01:27:29.483 --> 01:27:31.929
I can't do that?

01:27:35.422 --> 01:27:37.493
Because I'm a whore...

01:27:37.558 --> 01:27:41.165
I must do anything you want?

01:29:04.578 --> 01:29:05.578
Who is it?

01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:07.480
So-yool.

01:29:07.648 --> 01:29:08.648
Who's there?

01:29:09.583 --> 01:29:10.755
So-yool...

01:29:11.819 --> 01:29:13.059
So-yool.

01:29:15.422 --> 01:29:17.459
Yeon-hee! Yeon-hee!

01:29:18.359 --> 01:29:19.360
Help!

01:29:19.626 --> 01:29:23.472
Wake up, Yeon-hee!

01:29:25.399 --> 01:29:28.403
Oh no!

01:29:44.318 --> 01:29:45.318
Open up!

01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:47.921
"OPE" up now!

01:29:51.191 --> 01:29:52.465
Open the gate now!

01:29:59.466 --> 01:30:02.447
Thank you for coming but...

01:30:02.503 --> 01:30:04.414
Wait! Please!

01:30:06.006 --> 01:30:07.383
Wait!

01:30:07.408 --> 01:30:09.786
Please listen to me!

01:30:09.843 --> 01:30:12.756
Wait!

01:30:13.313 --> 01:30:16.692
Listen to me. Wait!

01:30:18.218 --> 01:30:19.492
Please!

01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:21.222
She's not here!

01:30:21.288 --> 01:30:23.461
Yeon-hee left here long ago!

01:30:23.524 --> 01:30:25.128
She's not here!

01:30:34.468 --> 01:30:35.811
What is it?

01:30:35.936 --> 01:30:37.745
We're searching for a killer.

01:30:38.172 --> 01:30:40.015
A killer?

01:30:41.241 --> 01:30:42.743
Then why search here?

01:30:46.346 --> 01:30:48.121
Out of my way.

01:30:51.485 --> 01:30:52.555
Hirata Kiyoshi!

01:30:56.457 --> 01:30:57.902
I am...

01:30:58.425 --> 01:31:01.668
the police commissioner's woman.

01:31:02.729 --> 01:31:05.676
If you don't find what
you want in my room...

01:31:06.767 --> 01:31:09.577
the commissioner...

01:31:09.636 --> 01:31:12.480
will see to this rudeness.

01:31:15.342 --> 01:31:16.342
Let's.

01:31:33.794 --> 01:31:36.400
I heard about the commotion today.

01:31:38.132 --> 01:31:39.907
Have you been to the zoo?

01:31:40.667 --> 01:31:45.514
If anyone challenges
the leader's authority...

01:31:46.473 --> 01:31:48.214
animals kill without mercy.

01:31:51.645 --> 01:31:52.817
SEO Yeon-hee...

01:31:53.147 --> 01:31:57.994
She'll never make you cry again.

01:32:06.627 --> 01:32:08.607
Everything that happened...

01:32:10.664 --> 01:32:12.371
it was you?

01:32:21.542 --> 01:32:23.180
You can't go now.

01:32:23.911 --> 01:32:25.788
Listen to me, Yeon-hee!

01:32:42.229 --> 01:32:43.230
Yeon-hee!

01:32:44.765 --> 01:32:45.766
Yeon-hee!

01:32:50.604 --> 01:32:51.605
You can't!

01:32:51.972 --> 01:32:52.972
Let go!

01:32:55.442 --> 01:32:56.614
Don't go!

01:32:56.677 --> 01:32:58.679
Don't go outside!

01:33:04.585 --> 01:33:06.064
Let go!

01:33:11.925 --> 01:33:15.896
Why? Why'd you do that to me!

01:33:19.199 --> 01:33:21.770
You gave me no choice.

01:33:26.607 --> 01:33:27.915
My everything...

01:33:29.209 --> 01:33:30.882
You stole it from me.

01:33:32.312 --> 01:33:34.314
When I gave you everything.

01:33:37.084 --> 01:33:39.086
Why'd you do that to me?

01:33:41.755 --> 01:33:46.329
I didn't steal anything.

01:33:54.468 --> 01:33:55.640
Look!

01:33:58.505 --> 01:34:00.644
Then why do I have nothing?

01:34:02.476 --> 01:34:03.750
You...

01:34:04.011 --> 01:34:05.684
Yoon-woo...

01:34:06.813 --> 01:34:08.292
No song...

01:34:15.756 --> 01:34:18.737
I wish you'd disappear.

01:34:22.262 --> 01:34:24.264
If it wasn't for you...

01:34:27.367 --> 01:34:29.404
I wouldn't be like this.

01:34:39.813 --> 01:34:40.814
No.

01:34:43.417 --> 01:34:45.124
You made yourself like that!

01:34:45.852 --> 01:34:48.162
You're nothing to me now.

01:34:49.856 --> 01:34:51.494
Not even a friend.

01:34:52.659 --> 01:34:54.730
You're just a filthy whore!

01:34:54.895 --> 01:34:56.465
The slut of a dirty bastard!

01:34:56.530 --> 01:34:57.530
No!

01:34:58.699 --> 01:34:59.699
No!

01:35:00.300 --> 01:35:01.870
Where's Yoon-woo?

01:35:02.669 --> 01:35:04.114
Tell me where he is!

01:35:04.171 --> 01:35:05.171
No!

01:35:05.272 --> 01:35:06.342
No!

01:35:17.484 --> 01:35:18.484
SEO Yeon-hee!

01:35:19.219 --> 01:35:22.325
I arrest you for killing
Lt. Maza Hidekki!

01:35:22.956 --> 01:35:25.459
If you resist, we'll shoot!

01:35:32.165 --> 01:35:33.165
Shoot!

01:36:09.469 --> 01:36:11.073
Do you resent me?

01:36:23.116 --> 01:36:25.653
Isn't it what you wanted?

01:36:55.515 --> 01:36:56.926
Mr. KIM Yoon-woo?

01:36:58.518 --> 01:37:00.395
Let's make a song together.

01:37:01.221 --> 01:37:03.201
<i>I can't write songs now.</i>

01:37:03.390 --> 01:37:05.199
<i>My songs are prohibited.</i>

01:37:05.258 --> 01:37:09.138
No problem. So-yool will sing your song.

01:37:10.363 --> 01:37:13.537
What she says goes around here.

01:37:15.035 --> 01:37:17.015
What do you mean?

01:37:18.638 --> 01:37:21.209
She's the commissioner's mistress.

01:37:25.378 --> 01:37:27.051
JUNG So-yool!

01:37:28.348 --> 01:37:31.261
Come out now!

01:37:41.127 --> 01:37:42.435
Where's Yeon-hee?

01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:45.774
Don't be so cold.

01:37:48.101 --> 01:37:50.911
There's a song I want you to hear.

01:37:58.078 --> 01:37:59.078
<i>♪ Love ♪</i>

01:38:06.152 --> 01:38:07.152
<i>♪ Lies ♪</i>

01:38:21.535 --> 01:38:22.535
<i>♪ My dear ♪</i>

01:38:27.073 --> 01:38:35.073
<i>♪ You love me ♪</i>

01:38:38.351 --> 01:38:39.351
<i>♪ All lies ♪</i>

01:38:50.630 --> 01:38:52.667
Love is all lies.

01:38:55.835 --> 01:38:56.836
Right?

01:39:03.810 --> 01:39:04.845
Listen.

01:39:07.714 --> 01:39:09.193
Until now...

01:39:09.849 --> 01:39:13.422
I've never had anyone in my heart but you.

01:39:14.921 --> 01:39:16.594
It'll always be you.

01:39:24.130 --> 01:39:26.440
My love won't change.

01:39:27.901 --> 01:39:29.312
Where's Yeon-hee?

01:39:36.276 --> 01:39:37.983
Yeon-hee is dead.

01:39:52.626 --> 01:39:54.264
I didn't do it.

01:39:55.428 --> 01:39:57.601
She just had bad luck.

01:40:03.737 --> 01:40:06.115
What did you do!

01:40:06.339 --> 01:40:08.945
What did you do to her!

01:40:09.609 --> 01:40:11.020
Yoon-woo...

01:40:13.580 --> 01:40:16.288
Shouldn't you ask why I'm here?

01:40:17.651 --> 01:40:23.897
And why I became a whore?

01:40:24.124 --> 01:40:26.365
Why?

01:40:27.594 --> 01:40:29.596
I don't care what you've become!

01:40:29.663 --> 01:40:32.041
Just tell me what you did!

01:40:34.267 --> 01:40:35.267
Let go!

01:40:36.136 --> 01:40:38.116
Don't touch him!

01:40:39.172 --> 01:40:40.981
He's my songwriter.

01:40:52.585 --> 01:40:56.897
Write a song just for me?

01:40:58.625 --> 01:40:59.626
Please?

01:41:04.030 --> 01:41:05.668
You promised.

01:41:08.702 --> 01:41:10.181
Right?

01:41:12.806 --> 01:41:14.183
So-yool...

01:41:18.311 --> 01:41:21.849
You swore! You promised!

01:41:35.128 --> 01:41:41.010
<i>Hurrah for Korean independence!</i>

01:41:44.771 --> 01:41:48.014
<i>Hurrah for independence!</i>

01:43:14.093 --> 01:43:17.666
You whore! Come here!

01:43:48.628 --> 01:43:51.108
There's a whore!

01:43:51.164 --> 01:43:54.634
The commissioner's mistress is here!

01:44:33.539 --> 01:44:37.851
<i>The album by SEO Yeon-hee
has been restored.</i>

01:44:38.144 --> 01:44:40.488
<i>After all these years...</i>

01:44:40.546 --> 01:44:44.961
<i>we'll be able to play,
'Joseon's Heart', tomorrow.</i>

01:44:45.251 --> 01:44:49.222
<i>If anyone out there knows

01:44:49.289 --> 01:44:56.002
<i>please call in to our station.
You're listening to Classic Oldies.</i>

01:45:06.940 --> 01:45:08.681
You know SEO Yeon-hee?

01:45:10.410 --> 01:45:13.584
What is your relationship to her?

01:45:16.316 --> 01:45:17.693
It's me.

01:45:17.917 --> 01:45:19.919
I'm SEO Yeon-hee.

01:45:25.325 --> 01:45:29.432
There are a few things I have to confirm.

01:45:30.830 --> 01:45:34.334
It was found at the site of Daesung Agency.

01:45:35.168 --> 01:45:38.149
The press doesn't know yet.

01:45:39.005 --> 01:45:43.977
Could you tell me about
the unreleased song?

01:45:49.649 --> 01:45:57.295
<i>♪ Alone on a barren field ♪</i>

01:45:57.957 --> 01:46:02.804

01:46:45.571 --> 01:46:47.278
SEO Yeon-hee...

01:47:15.001 --> 01:47:18.813
I was curious. I had to come.

01:47:20.006 --> 01:47:21.314
It's you!

01:47:26.345 --> 01:47:30.350
You don't recognize me
or are you pretending not to?

01:47:30.850 --> 01:47:33.228
I recognized you right away.

01:47:41.260 --> 01:47:44.673
That old man died and I got remarried.

01:47:44.831 --> 01:47:49.837
My husband and son
don't know how I lived.

01:47:52.839 --> 01:47:56.810
The Ok-hyang you knew died a long time ago.

01:47:57.877 --> 01:48:01.848
The So-yool I knew must've died too.

01:48:02.915 --> 01:48:06.328
Am I right?

01:48:10.590 --> 01:48:12.433
Don't forget.

01:48:12.959 --> 01:48:18.204
No matter what, just be a good singer.

01:48:29.175 --> 01:48:33.146
I enjoyed the song, Ms. SEO Yeon-hee.

01:49:01.207 --> 01:49:02.207
Madam!

01:49:03.576 --> 01:49:04.577
Madam!

01:49:12.218 --> 01:49:14.220
I have something for you.

01:49:40.246 --> 01:49:42.021
Wait here, madam.

01:50:06.939 --> 01:50:09.283
I think you'll be thrilled.

01:50:11.277 --> 01:50:14.554
<i>JUNG SO-YOOL
LOVE, LIES</i>

01:50:17.450 --> 01:50:19.623
'To my best friend in the world...'

01:50:19.719 --> 01:50:21.255
'JUNG So-yool'.

01:50:21.821 --> 01:50:24.461
This is the same person, right?

01:50:26.959 --> 01:50:29.337
You two must've been very close.

01:50:29.862 --> 01:50:32.138
Have you ever heard this song?

01:50:33.966 --> 01:50:36.503
It's been so long...

01:50:36.736 --> 01:50:38.044
That's true.

01:50:38.237 --> 01:50:42.708
Well, her songs all seem
like your imitations.

01:50:45.044 --> 01:50:47.251
But isn't it odd?

01:50:48.781 --> 01:50:50.761
'Love, Lies'.

01:50:51.951 --> 01:50:54.625
This song is completely different.

01:50:55.688 --> 01:50:59.295
Traditional singing method in a ballad.

01:50:59.358 --> 01:51:00.735
It's sounds so...

01:51:01.327 --> 01:51:02.863
I mean, her voice...

01:51:03.863 --> 01:51:09.108
Every note and every beat
is absolutely perfect.

01:51:10.870 --> 01:51:12.850
But it's so terribly sad.

01:51:13.205 --> 01:51:15.378
Something must've happened to her.

01:51:16.375 --> 01:51:19.618
I can feel her sadness completely.

01:51:20.313 --> 01:51:22.725
It's making me sad again.

01:51:23.716 --> 01:51:27.061
Anyway, it's the best of the best!

01:51:30.723 --> 01:51:36.264
You're much better, of course.

01:51:42.535 --> 01:51:44.845
Why didn't I know...

01:51:46.639 --> 01:51:48.676
How great it was?

01:51:51.811 --> 01:51:54.792
Why didn't I know then?

01:51:57.650 --> 01:51:59.652
Please, madam.

01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:03.826
You'll know when you hear it.

01:52:16.902 --> 01:52:18.677
I'll play the song.
