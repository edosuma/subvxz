[Kit Cloudkicker] Wow, all this nothing
is really something.

01:18.792 --> 01:22.166
[groans] I wouldn't want
to break down around here.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.750
[Baloo] That's why we brought Wildcat.

01:24.834 --> 01:26.250
Better see what he's up to.

01:28.875 --> 01:30.542
[Wildcat] Bombs away!

01:32.583 --> 01:34.000
What are you doing?

01:34.250 --> 01:37.625
These Carnubian kumquats
are worth do-re-mi.

01:38.166 --> 01:39.875
I'm getting rid of rotten ones.

01:40.417 --> 01:42.667
The only reason we're flying this shortcut

01:42.750 --> 01:45.208
so there won't be any rotten ones.

01:45.291 --> 01:47.625
It doesn't look like it's short enough.

01:47.709 --> 01:51.000
This smells worse
than colonel spigot's after-shave.

01:51.083 --> 01:56.250
Whoo-ee. We have to move our tail
or this deal will turn sour.

01:57.917 --> 02:00.500
-[siren]
-[Kit Cloudkicker] Sounds like the police.

02:00.583 --> 02:03.667
[Baloo] What police?
We're in the middle of nowhere.

02:04.041 --> 02:05.709
There aren't any police here.

02:06.709 --> 02:08.875
[Wendell] Pull over.

02:09.041 --> 02:13.542
Those kumquats and I don't have time
for cowboys and Indians.

02:22.375 --> 02:24.083
[Gomer] Let them have it, Wendell.

02:24.709 --> 02:26.375
[horse neighing]

02:34.375 --> 02:37.667
Whoa! They shot my baby.

02:38.083 --> 02:41.917
[Kit Cloudkicker] Guess we have
time for cowboys and Indians after all.

02:47.750 --> 02:50.500
[Gomer] This court is now in session.

02:50.583 --> 02:53.542
The prisoners are charged
with speeding, littering,

02:53.625 --> 02:56.583
and resisting arrest
over boomstone city limits.

02:56.917 --> 02:59.542
Six months' hard labor

02:59.625 --> 03:02.333
and confiscation of the offending vehicle.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.875
What? You can't do that.

03:04.959 --> 03:06.917
The <i>Sea Duck </i> is private property.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.667
Not anymore.

03:08.792 --> 03:11.500
Gomer, you've got to stop this.
you're not the sheriff.

03:11.583 --> 03:15.834
You are not a judge. You're just
an employee of Khan enterprises, like us.

03:16.208 --> 03:20.875
Clementine, why are you
making such a big deal?

03:20.959 --> 03:25.125
You're forcing people to work
in that horrible mine.

03:25.375 --> 03:29.041
Until Khan says different,
we run things my way.

03:29.208 --> 03:30.542
How can he?

03:30.667 --> 03:33.750
You've got the only phone and it's broken.

03:33.834 --> 03:39.750
Just keep writing those reports and keep
mailing them till we hear different.

03:39.834 --> 03:41.166
Take them away.

03:41.166 --> 03:43.792
What's Khan got to do with this?

03:43.875 --> 03:47.417
[Wendell] He owns
the town and the silver mine.

03:47.542 --> 03:52.166
We just happen to be pals
of Mr. Shere Khan.

03:53.208 --> 03:55.917
You better let us go
if you know what's good for ya.

03:56.041 --> 03:59.083
Mr. Khan owns this town,
but he don't run it.

03:59.500 --> 04:05.000
I do. Now put these pals
of Mr. Khan to work.

04:08.208 --> 04:10.750
[Baloo] When Khan hears about this,

04:10.834 --> 04:13.166
you won't be dogcatcher of a mud puddle.

04:13.250 --> 04:15.000
How's he going to find out?

04:15.125 --> 04:18.333
He'll read Clementine's reports.

04:18.416 --> 04:21.083
What reports are those, Wendell?

04:21.416 --> 04:24.583
Heh, heh. Not a thing, Sheriff.

04:24.667 --> 04:27.917
What Khan doesn't know won't hurt me.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.417
What's this stuff? It's not silver.

04:31.500 --> 04:33.959
It's urgonium, son.

04:34.041 --> 04:36.709
We ran out of silver
quite a while ago.

04:36.917 --> 04:41.583
Then our machines came across this stuff.

04:41.917 --> 04:43.875
[Baloo] Looks like it
didn't agree with them.

04:43.959 --> 04:48.542
[Gomer] Urgonium has a peculiarity
that's hard on machines...

04:49.125 --> 04:50.458
And miners.

04:50.542 --> 04:53.959
That's why we have to arrange
for special volunteers

04:54.041 --> 04:57.166
to work the mine, like you are.

04:57.750 --> 05:01.250
What kind of peculiarity
are we talking about?

05:01.417 --> 05:03.834
One that will have armies
and demolition companies

05:03.917 --> 05:07.291
paying through the nose for it.

05:07.667 --> 05:10.208
It's kind of pretty.

05:10.458 --> 05:13.166
Put that back, fuzz-for-brains.

05:13.250 --> 05:14.959
Anything you say.

05:15.417 --> 05:17.250
[explosion]

05:21.834 --> 05:25.834
That's a pretty peculiar peculiarity,
all right.

05:27.834 --> 05:29.792
You guys seen my cap?

05:32.250 --> 05:34.291
I don't believe it.

05:34.375 --> 05:37.166
What's the matter?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

05:37.250 --> 05:41.417
Baloo, look, Wildcat looks just like Khan.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.208
Well, uh...

05:43.291 --> 05:47.250
I guess there's no use pretending anymore.

05:47.333 --> 05:50.083
No. No use pretending.

05:50.458 --> 05:51.583
Pretending what?

05:52.583 --> 05:56.959
Ahem. They've discovered your
secret, Mr. Khan.

05:57.375 --> 05:59.417
Oh, yeah. Sure.

06:00.208 --> 06:02.750
My friends would call me Shere,

06:02.834 --> 06:04.709
but don't have any.

06:05.709 --> 06:09.542
Mr. Khan, what are you doing
dressed like that?

06:09.625 --> 06:12.041
I always dress this way,

06:12.125 --> 06:13.208
except for my birthday.

06:13.542 --> 06:15.208
I have a special suit for that.

06:15.291 --> 06:18.291
What he means is he dresses this way

06:18.375 --> 06:22.333
when investigating things
like missing reports.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.750
Wendell, get the plane ready to fly
them back to town.

06:26.834 --> 06:31.667
When he's rested, we'll have
his explanation.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.750
[Kit Cloudkicker] Aren't you going
to lock the door?

06:34.542 --> 06:39.625
The only way out is by plane,
and they like it here.

06:39.709 --> 06:42.625
So that's the great, powerful Khan.

06:43.041 --> 06:46.959
And he has a plane-- our ticket home.

06:48.959 --> 06:53.792
[Gomer] You'll be winging home
from this surprise visit soon.

06:53.875 --> 06:57.458
It seems our surprise
caught you by surprise.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.583
Your surprise ruined our surprise.

06:59.750 --> 07:02.917
You had a surprise? That's a surprise.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.417
We knew Mr. Khan had given up on our mine
when we discovered urgonium.

07:07.500 --> 07:09.333
We wanted it to be a surprise.

07:09.417 --> 07:11.125
Sure, you did.

07:11.208 --> 07:14.792
And you saved every piece just for him.

07:14.875 --> 07:20.667
Every trunk mined is on our getaway--
patrol plane for safe keeping.

07:20.917 --> 07:24.083
[Baloo] So it won't fall into
the wrong hands.

07:24.166 --> 07:25.500
That's it, exactly.

07:25.709 --> 07:28.667
Just been a big misunderstanding.

07:28.834 --> 07:30.125
Right, Mr. Khan?

07:30.500 --> 07:31.667
Mr. Khan?

07:31.750 --> 07:35.250
That would hold better
with some bubble gum.

07:36.333 --> 07:38.458
Planes are the boss' hobby.

07:38.542 --> 07:43.542
I figured that when I saw the antique
he was flying in.

07:44.542 --> 07:48.375
Make yourselves comfortable
till takeoff time.

07:48.458 --> 07:50.542
It's your town, after all.

07:50.625 --> 07:52.834
[Kit Cloudkicker]
I don't trust that sheriff.

07:53.291 --> 07:57.250
That's why we're making propwash
as soon as possible.

07:57.333 --> 07:59.542
We can't keep up this charade.

08:00.291 --> 08:02.625
Khan gets home and we're through.

08:02.709 --> 08:04.792
He's not getting home.

08:04.875 --> 08:07.000
Here's what you'll do.

08:08.208 --> 08:10.667
[Wildcat] I'm worried about
the <i>Sea Duck, </i> Baloo.

08:10.750 --> 08:14.542
Mmm... Relax, Mr. Khan.

08:14.875 --> 08:18.417
We'll sneak a look later
when things are a little less tense.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.500
Hello, Mr. Khan. Remember me?

08:22.583 --> 08:24.083
I'm Clementine Clevenger.

08:24.166 --> 08:26.166
You certainly had us fooled.

08:27.625 --> 08:30.709
Oh. Charmed, I'm sure.

08:31.041 --> 08:34.500
I thought we should go
over the books while you're here.

08:34.582 --> 08:36.792
It's been such a long time
since we heard from you.

08:37.041 --> 08:41.000
OK, but what are these numbers for?

08:41.082 --> 08:45.000
Why, Clementine,
what are you doing around here?

08:45.333 --> 08:48.709
I wanted to inform Mr. Khan on the mine.

08:48.792 --> 08:52.500
He doesn't want to spoil
his meal with work.

08:52.917 --> 08:56.041
How about a nice game of pool?

08:56.542 --> 08:57.375
My treat.

08:57.458 --> 09:01.417
I love pool, but I didn't bring my suit.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.500
Mr. Khan...

09:03.583 --> 09:05.125
[whispering]

09:05.208 --> 09:09.083
Uh, I mean, billiards would be divine.

09:09.250 --> 09:10.667
Come, my dear.

09:11.083 --> 09:12.250
Uh, but...

09:12.333 --> 09:15.208
If you'll excuse me,
I have to get my teeth cleaned.

09:17.375 --> 09:19.041
What about Clementine?

09:19.125 --> 09:23.208
Keeping her in the dark
while we stole the urgonium was a pain.

09:23.792 --> 09:25.458
[humming a tune]

09:25.542 --> 09:27.875
You're not at all what I expected

09:27.959 --> 09:31.041
a ruthless financial genius to be,
Mr. Khan.

09:31.417 --> 09:34.166
Oh? Ha ha ha. I've been sick.

09:39.166 --> 09:40.417
Stand back.

09:40.500 --> 09:42.458
I'm going to blast them.

09:47.500 --> 09:48.792
[Wildcat] I missed one.

09:50.709 --> 09:52.375
Uh, Mr. Khan.

09:52.542 --> 09:55.291
Why don't we give her
a tour of the <i>Sea Duck?</i>

09:55.500 --> 09:57.250
Before the sheriff comes back.

09:57.792 --> 09:59.291
Yeah! The <i>Sea Duck.</i>

09:59.375 --> 10:00.834
Come on, Clem.

10:04.125 --> 10:06.000
What are they doing?

10:06.166 --> 10:08.792
I don't care as long
as it's not done to me.

10:10.625 --> 10:12.375
Sheriff, they're gone!

10:12.458 --> 10:15.709
[Gomer] Get in there before
something happens to that ball.

10:15.792 --> 10:17.417
Uh, right.

10:24.125 --> 10:28.291
If it was raining soup,
you'd fetch a fork.

10:33.250 --> 10:35.834
[Wildcat] The <i>Sea Duck's</i>
over here, miss Clem.

10:36.875 --> 10:39.375
Where did that mechanic go?

10:39.458 --> 10:43.458
Why don't you look
at the engine, Mr. Khan?

10:43.542 --> 10:46.583
Is there anything he can't do?

10:46.667 --> 10:50.166
Yeah. Find his head with both hands.

10:50.250 --> 10:54.000
Can you determine the problem, Mr. Khan?

10:54.500 --> 10:56.417
Yeah. I've read this one already.

10:56.834 --> 10:59.417
I was referring to the engine, boss.

10:59.667 --> 11:01.417
Easy as pie.

11:01.500 --> 11:05.750
Great. Fix it while we distract--
entertain the sheriff.

11:05.834 --> 11:07.750
Got any bubble gum, Clem?

11:09.458 --> 11:13.917
I'm convinced nothing
is too difficult for you.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.750
I draw the line at Brussels sprouts.

11:17.125 --> 11:22.750
Right now, Brussels sprouts aren't
your most serious problem, Mr. Khan.

11:27.083 --> 11:30.750
[wolf howling]

11:32.875 --> 11:37.125
Now we'll see how you like it
down here, Khan.

11:37.208 --> 11:39.208
Yeah. You'll love it.

11:39.291 --> 11:41.458
There must be some mistake.

11:41.542 --> 11:44.792
What mistake?
We starve so you can get fat.

11:44.875 --> 11:47.625
I thought I was gaining weight.

11:47.709 --> 11:49.291
What will you do?

11:49.375 --> 11:53.375
It's not what we're going to do,
it's what you'll do.

11:57.583 --> 11:58.709
[Baloo] Lost?

11:58.792 --> 12:03.000
How could he be?
The town's only a block long.

12:03.083 --> 12:08.667
Maybe he wanted to get lost.
Miss Clevenger's a lot of woman.

12:09.709 --> 12:11.375
[Clementine Clevenger]
The miners took him!

12:11.458 --> 12:12.417
Huh?

12:12.500 --> 12:14.333
They've kidnapped Mr. Khan.

12:14.417 --> 12:16.750
Oh, it was terrible.

12:16.834 --> 12:20.250
[sighs] They gave me this to deliver.

12:22.625 --> 12:24.625
"We have Khan.

12:24.709 --> 12:28.709
We demand safe passage
out of this smelly place...

12:28.792 --> 12:31.417
"In the oppressor's own aircraft.

12:31.500 --> 12:34.125
Refuse us and Khan's history."

12:34.458 --> 12:36.917
We've got room. Let's get them!

12:37.000 --> 12:40.417
Not so fast. Nobody's going nowhere.

12:40.500 --> 12:42.417
We have to rescue Mr. Khan.

12:42.500 --> 12:46.125
I'm not going to succumb
to some hooligans.

12:46.208 --> 12:47.875
Mr. Khan would want it that way.

12:49.500 --> 12:52.125
You've been through a horrible experience.

12:52.208 --> 12:55.834
You go take a nap while I handle it.

12:56.750 --> 12:59.250
I'll show him a horrible experience.

12:59.375 --> 13:00.500
[both grunting]

13:01.166 --> 13:05.000
[Gomer] That will hold these two
till the miners are out of our hair

13:05.083 --> 13:08.792
and we can fly off into the sunset
with our urgonium.

13:14.333 --> 13:17.542
I should have known the sheriff
lied about the phone.

13:19.125 --> 13:20.875
Come on. Somebody pick it up.

13:22.250 --> 13:23.875
[telephone rings]

13:26.500 --> 13:29.542
[Shere Khan] This will teach me
to let my employees leave

13:29.625 --> 13:32.291
after a 16-hour workday.

13:32.709 --> 13:33.583
Yes.

13:33.917 --> 13:36.250
I need to speak with somebody.

13:36.500 --> 13:39.125
It's a matter of life and death
for Mr. Khan.

13:39.208 --> 13:40.792
Is that so?

13:40.875 --> 13:44.291
The miners in his Boomstone mine
snatched him.

13:44.375 --> 13:48.959
Really? Somehow I find
that hard to believe.

13:49.125 --> 13:51.709
Hurry, before it's too late.

13:51.834 --> 13:53.041
[Gomer] Clementine.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.667
Oh, no.

13:54.750 --> 13:57.917
You shouldn't be wandering around alone.

13:58.458 --> 14:00.500
Let me take you to your room

14:00.583 --> 14:05.625
and make sure you're not
disturbed till this Khan business is over.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.500
I guess I should investigate
my untimely abduction.

14:12.375 --> 14:14.500
[groaning] That darn sheriff.

14:14.583 --> 14:16.959
Mr. Khan shouldn't have trusted him.

14:17.917 --> 14:18.750
Oh, dear.

14:19.458 --> 14:21.041
What are they up to?

14:21.250 --> 14:24.083
We'll take care of Khan's boys
as soon as they open that door

14:24.166 --> 14:26.375
and try to rescue their boss.

14:26.458 --> 14:27.375
Where are they?

14:27.500 --> 14:31.250
I don't know.
I did everything you told me to.

14:31.333 --> 14:35.959
We'll say they were transporting
urgonium and had an accident.

14:36.792 --> 14:40.250
[Baloo] We've got to get out of here
and rescue Wildcat.

14:40.333 --> 14:44.709
[groaning] I don't think this
is going to do it.

14:47.417 --> 14:49.750
Mmm. Let me give it a try.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.917
[panting] Well, this works in the movies.

15:01.458 --> 15:03.291
So much for the movies.

15:04.166 --> 15:08.500
[screaming]

15:11.000 --> 15:13.125
[sighs] After her bath,

15:13.208 --> 15:14.875
a girl's ready for anything.

15:15.458 --> 15:17.792
Baloo, I'm stuck.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.750
Hang on, Little Britches.

15:25.041 --> 15:26.875
Go down and see what's the matter.

15:27.542 --> 15:28.750
[stammering] Sure, Sheriff.

15:29.583 --> 15:31.625
[Baloo] It's starting to give.

15:34.250 --> 15:35.500
Don't say it.

15:35.583 --> 15:37.709
Well, what now, Papa Bear?

15:38.375 --> 15:41.083
We've tried everything I can think of.

15:44.917 --> 15:47.917
Come on, Little Britches, let's vamoose.

15:48.375 --> 15:50.834
They're as slow as Wendell.

15:52.625 --> 15:54.834
Wait. What's this?

15:55.125 --> 15:58.083
[Gomer] All right, boys, come to papa.

16:02.041 --> 16:03.041
[Clementine Clevenger] Stop!

16:03.333 --> 16:06.208
Huh? What happened to you?

16:06.375 --> 16:09.667
Never mind. Just follow me out the back.

16:11.750 --> 16:14.625
I better tell the sheriff
they snucked off.

16:18.667 --> 16:20.667
Come on, come on.

16:22.083 --> 16:23.166
Aha!

16:26.083 --> 16:28.041
Oh, Wendell.

16:30.875 --> 16:32.583
They're headed for the mine.

16:33.875 --> 16:34.834
Come on.

16:34.917 --> 16:37.083
Yeah. Got to stop them.

16:37.417 --> 16:40.542
We must save Mr. Khan
and rescue those poor miners.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.750
We intend to save them,

16:42.834 --> 16:46.500
but about this "Mr. Khan" business...

16:48.542 --> 16:51.166
No wonder he wasn't what I expected.

16:51.375 --> 16:54.667
Let's hope the miners weren't too rough.

16:54.750 --> 16:55.792
[Kit Cloudkicker] Uh-oh.

16:55.875 --> 16:57.083
[Clementine Clevenger] The sheriff.

16:57.667 --> 16:58.750
Come on!

17:00.083 --> 17:02.125
They're going in the mine.

17:02.208 --> 17:03.959
But they ain't coming out.

17:04.290 --> 17:06.125
[Clementine panting]

17:06.208 --> 17:07.458
Are they coming?

17:07.541 --> 17:10.290
Not yet, but they're up to something.

17:13.709 --> 17:16.875
All right, Wendell,
break out the heavy artillery.

17:17.290 --> 17:19.083
Right away, sheriff.

17:26.416 --> 17:30.375
And now it's time
to live happily ever after.

17:31.250 --> 17:32.667
They blew up the tunnel.

17:32.750 --> 17:34.917
We'll take another way out.

17:35.250 --> 17:37.208
There is no other way out.

17:37.583 --> 17:38.417
Wildcat!

17:38.500 --> 17:40.417
Wildcat?

17:40.500 --> 17:43.333
That's my name. Don't wear it out.

17:43.417 --> 17:45.375
We should have known this wasn't Khan.

17:45.500 --> 17:50.208
If brains was perfume, you couldn't
smell him from the barbwire fence.

17:50.750 --> 17:53.458
If you want to work the real Khan over,

17:53.542 --> 17:55.375
you will have to wait
till we get you out of here.

17:55.709 --> 17:57.792
How are we supposed to do that?

17:57.875 --> 17:59.709
We are buried alive.

18:03.709 --> 18:06.125
We'll be OK. Just give me a hand.

18:06.458 --> 18:08.291
Wildcat, are you sure?

18:08.375 --> 18:12.166
Well, anybody got any bubble gum?

18:13.417 --> 18:16.417
Just think of it. A plane full of urgonium

18:16.750 --> 18:18.750
and no more Khan to fool with.

18:34.166 --> 18:37.333
I thought you was down with the miners.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.500
So I've been told.

18:39.583 --> 18:43.583
Hey, boss. Maybe the one
we got ain't the--

18:44.208 --> 18:45.458
Mr. Khan!

18:45.542 --> 18:46.667
What a surprise.

18:46.750 --> 18:49.667
We were just about to
call you to let you know

18:49.750 --> 18:52.625
about some problems with an impostor.

18:52.709 --> 18:55.792
I would enjoy meeting myself.

18:56.333 --> 18:57.625
Can you arrange it?

18:57.709 --> 19:01.500
I'm not sure we can get him right now--

19:02.083 --> 19:03.959
[rumbling]

19:04.125 --> 19:05.333
What's that?

19:12.917 --> 19:15.000
Last stop. Everybody out.

19:17.542 --> 19:20.041
How nice of you all to drop by.

19:20.125 --> 19:22.458
There he is Mr. Khan, the impostor,

19:22.542 --> 19:26.166
the low-down varmint who was trying
to steal your mine.

19:27.625 --> 19:31.834
You mistook him for me?

19:32.375 --> 19:35.542
And who are these?

19:35.709 --> 19:37.583
We mine your urgonium.

19:37.667 --> 19:41.125
Urgonium? How interesting.

19:41.208 --> 19:43.917
Why haven't I heard about this?

19:44.166 --> 19:45.667
Well, you see--

19:46.375 --> 19:47.417
Run!

19:51.250 --> 19:53.041
[neighing]

19:57.250 --> 19:59.917
Don't worry. We'll get them.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.417
You never told the sheriff
to mistreat the miners?

20:04.500 --> 20:09.083
My dear, I desire only money and power.

20:09.417 --> 20:13.792
Unpresentable employees
provide me with neither.

20:22.041 --> 20:23.250
That was close.

20:23.333 --> 20:24.500
[explosion]

20:24.583 --> 20:27.500
How will we fight against that?

20:27.583 --> 20:29.583
I've got an idea.

20:29.834 --> 20:31.792
[Gomer] Get ready, Wendell.

20:32.291 --> 20:35.542
This is going to be like shooting cans
with a scatter gun.

20:37.875 --> 20:40.291
These kumquats are so rotten,

20:41.041 --> 20:43.083
they're only good for ammunition.

20:43.333 --> 20:44.792
Load it, Baloo!

20:45.625 --> 20:47.166
Hold on!

20:51.834 --> 20:53.291
What's the fool doing?

20:53.375 --> 20:54.959
[Baloo] Let him have it.

20:55.041 --> 20:56.667
Bombs away.

20:59.291 --> 21:00.667
[Gomer] What was that?

21:00.959 --> 21:02.542
Great shooting, kid.

21:12.792 --> 21:14.375
Uh-oh.

21:22.083 --> 21:25.542
How do you like my new mine foreman?

21:25.625 --> 21:28.250
Why don't we ask the new miners?

21:30.917 --> 21:35.125
You probably don't like me now
that you've met the real Khan.

21:35.417 --> 21:39.125
Actually, Wildcat, since I've
met the real khan,

21:39.583 --> 21:41.375
I like you even better.

21:43.333 --> 21:48.417
[sighs] In gratitude for uncovering
this subterfuge,

21:48.500 --> 21:53.208
I suppose I can reimburse
you for your kumquats.

21:53.333 --> 21:54.875
That's real decent of you.

21:54.959 --> 21:57.875
I promise I won't tell a soul.

21:58.291 --> 22:01.709
Where's that mechanic fellow?

22:02.291 --> 22:04.875
I want to thank him, too.

22:05.208 --> 22:07.125
Well, Mr. Khan,

22:07.542 --> 22:10.709
I think you better ask your new foreman.
