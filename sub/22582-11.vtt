00:31.767 --> 00:34.679
- Archer to Commander Tucker.
- Go ahead.

00:34.807 --> 00:38.004
I know you're off duty,
but we've got visitors.

00:38.127 --> 00:41.563
- I can see that.
- Are you up for a little repair work?

00:41.687 --> 00:42.881
Sir?

00:43.007 --> 00:46.283
- Meet me at Docking Port 2.
- On my way.

00:52.367 --> 00:54.881
It's been a long road

00:57.647 --> 00:59.683
Gettin' from there to here

00:59.807 --> 01:02.685
It's been a long time

01:03.407 --> 01:06.922
But my time is finally near

01:07.327 --> 01:10.683
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

01:11.447 --> 01:14.359
I will touch the sky

01:14.847 --> 01:18.442
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

01:18.567 --> 01:21.400
No, they're not gonna change my mind

01:21.527 --> 01:25.679
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

01:26.207 --> 01:29.119
I'm going where my heart will take me

01:29.247 --> 01:33.160
I've got faith to believe

01:33.567 --> 01:36.525
I can do anything

01:36.647 --> 01:40.276
I've got strength of the soul

01:41.007 --> 01:43.919
And no one's gonna bend or break me

01:44.047 --> 01:47.403
I can reach any star

01:49.567 --> 01:51.364
I've got faith

01:53.287 --> 01:56.245
I've got faith

01:57.047 --> 02:00.403
Faith of the heart

02:16.967 --> 02:18.366
Anything serious?

02:18.487 --> 02:21.923
They said they were having trouble
with one of their life-support systems.

02:22.047 --> 02:23.685
- Who's they?
- Retellian cargo pilots.

02:28.287 --> 02:29.959
The seal is secure.

02:34.927 --> 02:36.360
Welcome aboard.

02:38.687 --> 02:40.803
Gracious of you to help us, Captain.

02:40.927 --> 02:42.121
We were beginning to think...

02:42.247 --> 02:44.761
our distress call
would never be answered.

02:44.887 --> 02:48.641
This is Subcommander T'Pol and
my chief engineer, Commander Tucker.

02:48.767 --> 02:50.246
Our salvation.

02:50.367 --> 02:53.040
The Captain said something
about life support.

02:53.167 --> 02:56.637
We were hired to return a young woman
to her homeworld.

02:56.767 --> 03:00.396
A few days ago,
her stasis pod began to malfunction.

03:00.527 --> 03:04.122
- Stasis? Is she injured?
- No.

03:04.247 --> 03:08.160
She's a passenger,
but our ship is designed to haul cargo...

03:08.287 --> 03:11.438
not people, and it's a very long journey.

03:11.567 --> 03:15.082
Putting her in suspended animation
was our only choice.

03:15.207 --> 03:17.277
We have another five months
ahead of us.

03:17.407 --> 03:20.399
If she wakes up, there won't be enough
food or air to breathe.

03:20.527 --> 03:24.042
If we're forced to abort the mission,
we won't get paid.

03:24.167 --> 03:26.522
Cdr. Tucker is resourceful.

03:26.647 --> 03:29.241
I'm sure he'll be able to assist you.

03:30.167 --> 03:32.806
- Mind if I have a look?
- Please.

03:37.927 --> 03:40.077
You've been very accommodating.

03:40.207 --> 03:43.722
If it's not too much trouble,
I'd like to make another request.

03:43.847 --> 03:47.442
It's been a long time
since we've enjoyed the luxury...

03:47.847 --> 03:49.519
of a bath.

03:50.567 --> 03:54.003
I understand.
T'Pol will show you to guest quarters.

03:54.527 --> 03:56.807
When you're done,
I'll have my chef prepare you a meal.

03:56.807 --> 03:58.081
When you're done,
I'll have my chef prepare you a meal.

04:12.407 --> 04:15.285
This regulates power flow to the biopod.

04:16.807 --> 04:18.445
Looks very creative.

04:18.567 --> 04:21.639
These relays
are from an old Ardanan shuttle.

04:21.767 --> 04:24.600
They weren't designed
to carry this much current.

04:24.727 --> 04:28.037
I've got some EPS conduits
that might do the trick.

04:36.047 --> 04:38.925
This would be a lot easier
if I could read your language.

04:39.047 --> 04:42.722
If you don't mind, I'd like to ask our
communications officer to help me.

04:42.847 --> 04:44.439
By all means.

04:55.887 --> 04:57.639
Is there a problem?

04:59.127 --> 05:01.800
No. No problem.

05:02.807 --> 05:05.401
I'm going to need some tools
from Enterprise.

05:05.527 --> 05:06.926
With a little luck...

05:07.047 --> 05:10.756
Sleeping Beauty here
will never know there was a problem.

05:19.887 --> 05:21.400
Come in.

05:25.247 --> 05:27.761
I hope I didn't deplete your water supply.

05:27.887 --> 05:30.117
I'm sure we'll manage. Please.

05:33.647 --> 05:37.117
T'Pol tells me your vessel
can't do much better than warp 2.

05:37.247 --> 05:38.805
Warp 2.2.

05:40.287 --> 05:42.721
I've been making some calculations.

05:42.847 --> 05:45.520
If I'm not mistaken, at warp 4.5...

05:45.647 --> 05:49.162
Enterprise can have you at
your destination in less than four days.

05:49.287 --> 05:50.766
That's a generous offer...

05:50.887 --> 05:53.799
but I've already inconvenienced you
far too much.

05:53.927 --> 05:55.440
It's no inconvenience.

05:55.567 --> 05:57.558
We're out here to meet new people.

05:57.687 --> 06:01.316
You're heading toward
an inhabited world we've never seen.

06:01.447 --> 06:03.961
First contacts
tend to go more smoothly...

06:04.087 --> 06:07.045
when a familiar face
is making the introductions.

06:07.167 --> 06:09.727
I'm sure you'll do fine on your own.

06:10.327 --> 06:12.602
You could dock in our launch bay.

06:12.727 --> 06:15.400
You wouldn't have to worry
about that stasis pod.

06:15.527 --> 06:18.121
We have plenty of room for you
and your passenger.

06:18.247 --> 06:20.477
It's not that simple, Captain.

06:20.607 --> 06:23.405
This has all been carefully prearranged.

06:23.527 --> 06:26.325
Her family's not expecting her
for another five months.

06:26.447 --> 06:29.325
They're not even
on her homeworld at the moment.

06:29.447 --> 06:32.245
But I will accept your offer of a meal...

06:32.807 --> 06:34.684
if it's not too late.

06:50.047 --> 06:51.480
Commander?

06:58.287 --> 07:01.120
- Hello?
- Is that the translation?

07:02.287 --> 07:04.926
- Give or take an adverb.
- Thanks.

07:05.887 --> 07:08.526
At least you don't have to work alone.

07:08.927 --> 07:11.282
Hell of a way to travel, isn't it?

07:11.407 --> 07:12.681
Who is she? Any idea?

07:12.807 --> 07:15.321
I asked Plinn, but he doesn't know
too much about her.

07:15.447 --> 07:18.200
Said something about
studying medicine in a research colony.

07:18.327 --> 07:20.682
- A doctor?
- I suppose so.

07:21.007 --> 07:25.603
She must have a real passion for it
if she's willing to go through all this.

07:26.007 --> 07:28.362
Shame we'll never get to meet her.

07:28.487 --> 07:31.001
It's not polite to stare, Commander.

07:32.207 --> 07:33.720
What's that supposed to mean?

07:33.847 --> 07:37.556
Let me know if you have any problems
with that translation.

07:37.687 --> 07:39.359
I wasn't staring.

07:45.647 --> 07:47.080
Hoshi?

07:53.767 --> 07:55.439
Are you all right?

08:00.047 --> 08:02.322
- Problem?
- The stasis pod.

08:02.447 --> 08:04.756
- What about it?
- It's malfunctioning.

08:04.887 --> 08:07.196
If you'll excuse me, Captain.

08:07.327 --> 08:09.921
- I'll show you to the docking port.
- I know the way.

08:15.167 --> 08:17.362
- What are you doing?
- Help me open this thing.

08:17.487 --> 08:20.763
- We can't bring her out of stasis.
- She's suffocating.

08:21.127 --> 08:23.641
The release is jammed. Don't bother.

08:26.687 --> 08:30.043
I'm sorry about this.
The O-2 recycler went off-line.

08:30.487 --> 08:32.717
You're going to be all right.

08:37.927 --> 08:38.916
Yes?

08:39.047 --> 08:41.765
There's a minor problem.
I'm going to need your assistance.

08:41.886 --> 08:43.206
What kind of problem?

08:43.327 --> 08:46.205
The malfunction is more complicated
than I expected.

08:46.327 --> 08:48.557
I'll be there in a moment.

08:48.687 --> 08:51.326
- I don't mean to be rude.
- Not at all.

08:57.927 --> 09:00.122
Archer to Commander Tucker.

09:01.447 --> 09:03.324
Trip, can you hear me?

09:09.247 --> 09:11.158
Archer to Lieutenant Reed.

09:13.487 --> 09:15.045
- Mr Plinn?
- That's right.

09:15.167 --> 09:18.079
Lieutenant Reed. The Captain asked me
to escort you back to your ship.

09:18.207 --> 09:21.404
- That won't be necessary.
- I'm afraid I'm under orders.

09:21.527 --> 09:24.678
- Have I done something wrong?
- It's just a precaution.

09:25.207 --> 09:29.598
I didn't realise leaving the Captain's
table would cause so much concern.

09:59.647 --> 10:03.162
- He's trying to break loose.
- Secure the docking clamps.

10:18.687 --> 10:21.724
- Report.
- He hasn't gotten far at warp 2, sir.

10:21.847 --> 10:24.600
- Hail him.
- No response.

10:26.767 --> 10:29.406
Phase-cannons. Target his engines.

10:32.327 --> 10:35.842
Direct hit to the port nacelle.
He's dropping out of warp.

10:42.007 --> 10:45.158
Bring us into grappling range.
Hail him again.

10:47.087 --> 10:48.315
Captain.

10:53.367 --> 10:54.720
T'Pol?

10:54.847 --> 10:57.680
Dilithium hydroxyls.
Ionised pyrosulfates.

10:57.807 --> 10:59.479
He's moving off.

11:00.567 --> 11:01.966
Stay with him.

11:09.247 --> 11:11.203
I thought
you took out one of his nacelles.

11:11.327 --> 11:13.477
- So did I.
- Our warp drive won't engage.

11:13.607 --> 11:16.485
That cloud he released,
it got into the plasma vents.

11:16.607 --> 11:18.165
They'll have to be purged.

11:18.287 --> 11:20.596
He's moving out of sensor range.

11:22.127 --> 11:23.685
I've lost him.

11:36.127 --> 11:38.561
What the hell did you do that for?

11:39.007 --> 11:41.157
Hold on.

11:41.607 --> 11:43.643
I'm not working with them.

11:46.807 --> 11:49.367
Calm down. I'm not going to hurt you.

11:50.047 --> 11:52.800
I'm from a starship called Enterprise.

11:53.727 --> 11:55.206
Enterprise.

11:56.167 --> 12:00.001
Now put that thing down,
and I'll untie you.

12:01.367 --> 12:03.927
Your hands. I'll free your hands.

12:05.727 --> 12:07.524
Let me help you.

12:12.927 --> 12:16.203
- What the hell's going on?
- Is it repaired?

12:16.647 --> 12:18.603
- What?
- The stasis pod.

12:18.927 --> 12:20.406
Where's Captain Archer?

12:20.527 --> 12:23.200
Your ship is a long way from here.

12:25.607 --> 12:28.838
Repair the pod
so we can put her back in stasis.

12:28.967 --> 12:31.083
It's going to take a few hours.

12:31.207 --> 12:32.879
Work quickly.

12:48.127 --> 12:49.799
You're welcome?

12:53.967 --> 12:56.435
Have you seen a little device?

12:56.807 --> 12:59.765
It's about this big, has a keypad on it.

13:01.207 --> 13:03.562
It's my Universal Translator.

13:04.407 --> 13:07.080
It'll help us understand each other.

13:12.687 --> 13:14.006
That's it.

13:14.687 --> 13:16.882
It's just so we can talk.

13:25.447 --> 13:28.917
I need you to say something.
You got to keep talking.

13:35.127 --> 13:36.685
A little more.

13:43.807 --> 13:45.763
Can you understand me?

13:47.047 --> 13:48.526
Where's Hoshi when you need her?

13:48.647 --> 13:50.956
- Who is Hoshi?
- That's better.

13:52.527 --> 13:55.439
Would you mind telling me
what's going on here?

13:55.567 --> 13:58.161
How long have I been in stasis?

13:58.287 --> 14:00.437
You'd have to ask them.

14:01.447 --> 14:03.438
Commander Tucker to Enterprise.

14:04.447 --> 14:06.517
Enterprise, do you hear me?

14:07.127 --> 14:10.164
- You are an officer?
- Chief Engineer.

14:12.767 --> 14:14.962
Feels like we've gone to warp.

14:15.087 --> 14:18.602
Explain yourself.
What do you know about my abductors?

14:18.727 --> 14:20.763
We thought they were cargo pilots.

14:20.887 --> 14:23.242
They claimed you were their passenger.

14:23.367 --> 14:24.846
I am their prisoner.

14:24.967 --> 14:27.117
I was returning
from a diplomatic mission...

14:27.247 --> 14:30.557
when they attacked my transport,
murdered my guards.

14:32.807 --> 14:35.196
You don't know who I am, do you?

14:35.887 --> 14:36.922
Should I?

14:37.047 --> 14:39.880
My family is known
on hundreds of worlds.

14:41.007 --> 14:43.919
I'm afraid Earth isn't one of them.

14:44.287 --> 14:46.403
So I take it you're not a doctor.

14:46.527 --> 14:50.725
I am First Monarch of
the Sovereign Dynasty of Krios Prime.

14:53.487 --> 14:56.763
Charles Tucker III. Pleased to meet you.

14:57.887 --> 15:00.481
- So what do these guys want?
- Ransom.

15:00.607 --> 15:03.644
No doubt they'll demand a high price
for my safe return.

15:03.767 --> 15:06.076
Listen, my captain will be looking
for me.

15:06.207 --> 15:09.597
All we have to do is get off this ship
and let them know where we are.

15:09.727 --> 15:12.082
And how do you propose we do that?

15:12.207 --> 15:15.279
I saw a shuttlebay earlier.
There were a couple of escape pods.

15:15.407 --> 15:18.479
- You're not going anywhere.
- I beg your pardon?

15:18.607 --> 15:21.679
We'll remain here until they contact
the Sovereign Guard.

15:21.807 --> 15:24.401
Once the ransom has been paid,
we'll be released.

15:24.527 --> 15:26.165
If it's all the same to you...

15:26.287 --> 15:28.039
I'd rather take my chances
in open space.

15:28.167 --> 15:31.762
It's too dangerous.
If you leave, it would provoke them.

15:31.887 --> 15:33.036
If I remember right...

15:33.167 --> 15:35.806
this access tube leads to a junction
near the shuttlebay.

15:35.927 --> 15:38.395
You are not to leave this chamber.

15:38.527 --> 15:41.803
With all due respect,
I'm not one of your subjects.

15:50.767 --> 15:52.405
He's your partner.

15:53.287 --> 15:55.881
You must have some idea
where he's going.

15:56.007 --> 16:00.717
Obviously I'm his victim as well.
Why else would he leave me here?

16:00.847 --> 16:03.441
Where were you taking your passenger?

16:03.567 --> 16:04.920
Goff had the coordinates.

16:05.047 --> 16:07.481
You don't even know what system
you were heading for.

16:07.607 --> 16:11.520
It wasn't my responsibility.
He was piloting the ship, not me.

16:11.847 --> 16:14.202
I spent most of my time
looking after the cargo.

16:14.327 --> 16:16.318
Believe me, Captain...

16:16.447 --> 16:19.405
I'm as eager to find my partner
as you are.

16:23.927 --> 16:25.565
If that's true...

16:26.527 --> 16:29.724
then we could work together
to track him down.

16:30.127 --> 16:31.879
I don't see how.

16:32.007 --> 16:34.202
We've got pretty good
long-range sensors...

16:34.327 --> 16:37.603
but your ship could be anywhere
within a half-dozen light-years.

16:37.727 --> 16:41.083
It'd be a lot easier
if we knew your warp frequency.

16:41.207 --> 16:44.085
I'm afraid I can't help you with that.

16:44.207 --> 16:46.846
I know very little about warp engines.

16:47.727 --> 16:50.241
Take him back to Docking Port 2.

16:51.407 --> 16:53.875
Put him in the airlock
and post a security detail.

16:54.007 --> 16:55.963
I'm telling you the truth.

16:56.087 --> 16:57.884
We'll keep the outer hatch unlocked.

16:58.007 --> 17:00.726
If you decide to leave,
you know the way out.

17:07.047 --> 17:11.119
Could you hand me that circuit probe?
The one with the green handle?

17:16.727 --> 17:18.718
You must be one hell of a diplomat.

17:18.847 --> 17:21.645
Is your entire species so ill-mannered?

17:21.767 --> 17:23.916
No. Just me.

17:24.446 --> 17:26.403
You know,
if you were thinking rationally...

17:26.527 --> 17:28.882
you'd be repairing that stasis pod.

17:29.007 --> 17:31.157
He did threaten to kill you.

17:31.287 --> 17:33.562
That's precisely why
I'm getting out of here.

17:33.687 --> 17:38.317
I really doubt they'll keep me around
once I've fixed their problem.

17:38.567 --> 17:40.603
You know,
I realise someone in your position...

17:40.727 --> 17:43.082
isn't used to taking advice
from a guy like me...

17:43.207 --> 17:45.277
but I strongly suggest you come along.

17:45.407 --> 17:48.046
He'd never harm me.
I'm too valuable to them.

17:48.167 --> 17:51.204
I've been involved
in a few hostage situations.

17:51.327 --> 17:54.205
They rarely turn out
the way you'd expect.

17:55.527 --> 17:57.518
You're correct, Mr Tucker.

17:57.647 --> 18:00.400
I don't take advice from people like you.

18:03.687 --> 18:06.963
You know,
that stasis pod won't fix itself.

18:09.367 --> 18:12.040
Chances are you're going to spend
the next five months...

18:12.167 --> 18:14.123
tied up in this grimy little cargo hold.

18:14.247 --> 18:16.397
Not exactly my idea of a royal voyage.

18:16.527 --> 18:18.040
I'll be fine.

18:18.367 --> 18:20.085
When I get back to Enterprise...

18:20.207 --> 18:22.641
I'll make sure we get a message
to your homeworld.

18:22.767 --> 18:25.486
- Krios?
- Krios Prime.

18:26.447 --> 18:27.880
Take care.

18:29.167 --> 18:31.123
Once you've launched an escape pod...

18:31.247 --> 18:33.238
what makes you think
they won't destroy it?

18:33.367 --> 18:35.483
I'm going to reroute
their internal sensors.

18:35.607 --> 18:39.566
I'll be a million kilometres away
before they know I'm gone.

18:39.687 --> 18:41.527
I'm much better company.

18:43.727 --> 18:46.878
- How much further?
- Just a few more metres.

18:47.007 --> 18:49.362
Are you sure this is the right direction?

18:49.487 --> 18:51.239
Keep your voice down.

18:51.807 --> 18:54.401
What am I supposed
to call you, anyway?

18:54.767 --> 18:56.246
First Monarch?

18:58.007 --> 19:00.680
- Your Highness?
- Kaitaama.

19:02.167 --> 19:05.364
- What is that, some kind of title?
- It's my name.

19:08.167 --> 19:10.237
What are you doing?

19:10.367 --> 19:12.642
These lead to internal sensors.

19:24.607 --> 19:26.643
We don't have all day.

19:40.527 --> 19:42.677
This is meant for one person.

19:43.487 --> 19:45.284
We'll have to make do.

19:45.887 --> 19:48.959
Unless you know
how to fly one of these things.

20:37.127 --> 20:38.765
What was that?

20:38.887 --> 20:41.481
We're crossing the subspace threshold.

20:45.087 --> 20:46.884
That wasn't so bad.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.522
What do you propose we do next?

20:50.647 --> 20:53.480
To be honest,
I hadn't really thought about it.

20:53.607 --> 20:55.837
I assumed you had a plan.

20:55.967 --> 20:57.719
I was only joking.

20:57.967 --> 21:00.322
They do have a sense of humour
where you come from?

21:00.447 --> 21:02.199
Among the commoners.

21:03.407 --> 21:04.999
Only joking.

21:06.767 --> 21:09.679
It's only a matter of time
before they realise we're gone.

21:09.807 --> 21:12.162
No doubt they'll come about
and look for us.

21:12.287 --> 21:14.721
- We need a place to hide.
- Where?

21:16.047 --> 21:18.322
If I'm translating this right...

21:18.447 --> 21:21.007
there's a system
about 90 million kilometres from here.

21:21.127 --> 21:23.721
We should be able to reach it
in a day or so.

21:23.847 --> 21:26.600
What makes you think
any of those planets are habitable?

21:26.727 --> 21:28.718
Only one way to find out.

21:29.527 --> 21:32.599
Permission to set a course,
Your Sovereignty?

21:33.087 --> 21:34.918
Proceed.

21:49.807 --> 21:52.446
This'd be a whole lot easier
if you'd stop moving around.

21:52.567 --> 21:55.718
- You are touching me.
- I'm afraid I don't have much choice.

21:55.847 --> 21:58.805
It's inappropriate
to touch the First Monarch.

21:58.927 --> 22:01.885
You're welcome to step outside
until I'm done.

22:03.007 --> 22:04.599
Excuse me.

22:04.727 --> 22:07.241
Here we go. Landing thrusters.

22:08.767 --> 22:10.485
No, wait, they're stabilisers.

22:10.607 --> 22:13.041
You have no idea
how to control this vehicle.

22:13.167 --> 22:14.486
I'm working on it.

22:14.607 --> 22:16.757
Even if we do find
a breathable atmosphere...

22:16.887 --> 22:19.276
and you manage
to land without killing us...

22:19.407 --> 22:21.841
what will we do about food? Water?

22:21.967 --> 22:24.117
There could be hostile life forms
on the surface.

22:24.247 --> 22:25.760
How will we protect ourselves?

22:25.887 --> 22:29.197
I've got less than 24 hours to figure out
how to scan a star system...

22:29.327 --> 22:32.319
and program a descent sequence
in a language I don't understand.

22:32.447 --> 22:35.519
And I'm not going to get it done
if you interrupt me every five seconds.

22:35.647 --> 22:39.356
So I'd appreciate it
if you'd keep quiet until I'm finished.

22:40.287 --> 22:43.165
- Now, lift your butt.
- My what?

22:43.287 --> 22:45.164
Your behind, your rear end.

22:45.287 --> 22:47.721
I haven't checked that panel yet.

22:51.167 --> 22:52.566
Quickly.

22:53.527 --> 22:56.758
You know,
you were a lot more pleasant in stasis.

23:01.127 --> 23:03.721
I think I found the landing thrusters.

23:07.607 --> 23:11.805
I understand how difficult this must be
for someone of your upbringing.

23:11.927 --> 23:14.282
But we could be stuck out here
for a while.

23:14.407 --> 23:16.875
We should find a way to get along.

23:19.087 --> 23:22.921
- I'm willing to give it a try if you are.
- My hand.

23:23.967 --> 23:26.162
You're sitting on my hand.

23:29.527 --> 23:31.199
I'll try.

23:47.567 --> 23:50.320
The prisoner, sir. As ordered.

23:57.407 --> 23:58.726
Thank you.

23:58.847 --> 24:01.236
Will there be anything else, Captain?

24:01.367 --> 24:04.040
Not right now, Lieutenant. Dismissed.

24:09.127 --> 24:10.719
Have a seat.

24:12.287 --> 24:14.755
Why have I been brought here?

24:14.887 --> 24:16.525
Sit down.

24:20.127 --> 24:22.687
I already told you everything I know.

24:22.807 --> 24:25.275
We're not here
to talk about your partner.

24:25.407 --> 24:27.762
We're here to talk about you.

24:27.887 --> 24:29.798
What about me?

24:29.927 --> 24:33.556
You're facing
some very serious charges, Mr Plinn.

24:33.687 --> 24:35.359
Where we come from...

24:35.487 --> 24:37.876
criminals are held accountable
for their actions.

24:38.007 --> 24:40.885
If they're found guilty, they're punished.

24:41.927 --> 24:45.124
This is where your tribunal
is going to take place.

24:45.247 --> 24:48.922
Tribunal! I am not subject to your laws.

24:49.287 --> 24:51.676
That's not for me to decide.

24:56.047 --> 24:59.596
Starfleet asked
the Vulcan High Command...

25:00.607 --> 25:03.679
to assign a judicial administrator
to Enterprise.

25:03.807 --> 25:06.116
Someone who wouldn't be swayed
by human emotion.

25:06.247 --> 25:08.317
Someone objective, logical.

25:08.447 --> 25:09.766
From what I understand...

25:09.887 --> 25:12.685
Subcommander T'Pol
has already reviewed the evidence.

25:12.807 --> 25:15.002
This tribunal...

25:16.247 --> 25:18.636
is nothing more than a formality.

25:18.967 --> 25:21.481
I thought you should be prepared.

25:24.007 --> 25:25.998
Her punishments can be...

25:27.607 --> 25:29.086
severe.

25:29.407 --> 25:31.125
How severe?

25:31.247 --> 25:35.001
If you're late for your shift,
you might receive a beating.

25:35.687 --> 25:38.121
But for more grievous offences...

25:38.767 --> 25:42.157
dereliction of duty,
conduct unbecoming an officer...

25:45.967 --> 25:49.243
We started out with 83 crewmen
on board.

25:52.567 --> 25:54.603
We're down to 76.

25:54.727 --> 25:56.718
But I haven't done anything wrong.

25:56.847 --> 26:00.044
Accessory to kidnapping,
resisting arrest...

26:00.167 --> 26:02.044
obstruction of an investigation...

26:02.167 --> 26:04.556
causing damage to a Starfleet vessel.

26:04.687 --> 26:05.881
What damage?

26:06.007 --> 26:09.124
When your partner fled he released
a cloud of dilithium hydroxyls...

26:09.247 --> 26:12.125
- that clogged our plasma vents.
- I had nothing to do with that.

26:12.247 --> 26:15.364
As I said, I'm not the one
you have to convince.

26:23.287 --> 26:25.005
Subcommander.

26:26.247 --> 26:29.045
Has the accused been informed
of the charges?

26:29.167 --> 26:30.646
Yes, ma'am.

26:34.287 --> 26:36.960
- How much do you weigh?
- What?

26:39.287 --> 26:42.324
- Your weight.
- 72 kilograms.

26:45.087 --> 26:47.920
- Height?
- 1.8 metres.

26:48.047 --> 26:50.163
Why are you asking these questions?

26:50.287 --> 26:53.597
Does your culture observe
any postmortem rituals?

26:53.727 --> 26:55.877
This is not fair.

26:56.007 --> 26:59.204
I demand to speak with someone
from my government.

26:59.607 --> 27:01.245
He's got a point.

27:01.687 --> 27:04.076
We've never tried an alien before.

27:04.447 --> 27:07.280
Maybe we should contact
the High Command.

27:07.887 --> 27:10.447
They've granted me complete autonomy
in these matters.

27:10.567 --> 27:14.480
If I had to consult my superiors
every time I made a ruling...

27:14.607 --> 27:16.916
it would defeat my purpose here.

27:17.367 --> 27:20.359
- We'll convene at 1800 hours.
- As you wish.

27:26.647 --> 27:28.558
You can't allow this.

27:28.967 --> 27:32.243
- There's nothing I can do.
- But you're the captain.

27:35.647 --> 27:37.956
She owes me a few favours.

27:40.247 --> 27:42.283
I can't promise anything, but I...

27:44.447 --> 27:47.166
...I'd be willing to ask for leniency.

27:47.847 --> 27:50.805
Of course, I'd want something in return.

27:51.647 --> 27:55.003
We still haven't found a way
to locate your vessel.

27:57.447 --> 28:00.405
If you could remember
that warp frequency...

28:11.247 --> 28:14.284
Are there any provisions? I'm hungry.

28:14.607 --> 28:17.280
You might check that
storage compartment above your head.

28:17.407 --> 28:19.921
- You do it.
- I'm busy.

28:26.487 --> 28:29.638
If you find any water up there,
I could use some.

28:31.687 --> 28:33.405
Thanks.

28:40.767 --> 28:42.359
Allow me.

28:46.607 --> 28:48.802
I'm not contagious.

28:55.967 --> 28:57.605
Is it edible?

29:02.167 --> 29:05.000
Depends how hungry you are.

29:09.967 --> 29:13.084
- It reminds me of my first car.
- Car?

29:14.647 --> 29:17.036
A four-wheeled vehicle.

29:17.167 --> 29:19.601
It wasn't much bigger than this.

29:20.607 --> 29:24.282
All we're missing is the ocean breeze
coming off the gulf.

29:24.407 --> 29:27.956
I used to drive out to a place
called Chatkin Point.

29:28.927 --> 29:31.122
Park along the shoreline...

29:32.487 --> 29:35.320
and stare at the moon with my girlfriend.

29:37.007 --> 29:39.919
Don't worry, I won't make a pass at you.

29:40.687 --> 29:43.997
The Sovereign Guard would cut off one
of your hands.

29:44.447 --> 29:46.722
You must be a fun date.

29:47.407 --> 29:51.286
The First Monarch doesn't socialise
with the opposite sex.

29:51.887 --> 29:54.162
You've never been on a date?

29:55.207 --> 29:59.325
Four years ago, before I was selected
to ascend to First Monarch...

29:59.447 --> 30:02.883
I was courted by young men
from many noble families.

30:04.647 --> 30:09.004
Now I spend my personal time
in the company of my father's advisors.

30:10.767 --> 30:12.678
Sounds kind of lonely.

30:14.367 --> 30:16.881
You haven't finished your work.

30:31.727 --> 30:33.206
It's all water.

30:33.327 --> 30:35.397
There's a chain of islands
near the equator.

30:35.527 --> 30:37.563
Will we be able to breathe?

30:37.687 --> 30:40.520
Oxygen, nitrogen,
with a trace of methane.

30:40.647 --> 30:44.003
- Nothing we can't handle.
- Do you detect any life forms?

30:44.127 --> 30:46.436
If I could figure out how to use
the biosensors.

30:46.567 --> 30:48.922
Are you certain
we have the correct planet?

30:49.047 --> 30:51.845
It's the only one with an atmosphere.

30:53.807 --> 30:55.957
You may begin our descent.

30:56.087 --> 30:58.681
Let's hope I get this right.

31:07.487 --> 31:09.796
We're entering the thermosphere.

31:10.847 --> 31:12.200
The port stabiliser is down.

31:12.327 --> 31:13.840
- Can you repair it?
- No.

31:13.967 --> 31:17.004
But the starboard one
should keep us on course.

31:23.327 --> 31:25.716
- Mr Tucker!
- So far, so good.

31:27.047 --> 31:29.880
8,000 metres. I think they're metres.

31:30.007 --> 31:31.520
7,000.

31:33.327 --> 31:37.081
I'm pretty sure the braking thrusters
are firing. 5,000 metres.

31:37.727 --> 31:40.560
You might want to grab hold
of something.

31:46.767 --> 31:48.280
2,000 metres.

31:49.207 --> 31:50.435
1,000.

31:53.207 --> 31:54.481
Hold on!

31:57.487 --> 31:58.920
You all right?

31:59.047 --> 32:01.800
- What is that?
- Damned if I know.

32:35.487 --> 32:37.398
This heat is unbearable.

32:37.527 --> 32:41.076
It's nothing compared to a summer
in the Everglades.

32:41.207 --> 32:43.880
At least there aren't any mosquitoes.

32:46.647 --> 32:49.081
- Where are we going?
- Over there.

32:49.407 --> 32:51.796
Looks like a good place to set up camp.

32:51.927 --> 32:54.566
Your vessel will never find us here.

32:54.687 --> 32:57.247
Don't underestimate Captain Archer.

33:09.967 --> 33:12.845
- You're bleeding.
- It's just a scratch.

33:12.967 --> 33:16.084
- Remove your uniform.
- I'll take care of it later.

33:16.207 --> 33:19.005
We have no idea what microbes live
in this environment.

33:19.127 --> 33:21.846
- It could become infected.
- I said later.

33:21.967 --> 33:24.686
You're my only hope
of surviving here, Mr Tucker.

33:24.807 --> 33:27.082
I don't intend to let you die.

33:56.767 --> 33:58.246
This one.

34:05.527 --> 34:07.085
Hold still.

34:08.047 --> 34:10.447
The provisions won't last
for more than a day.

34:10.447 --> 34:11.243
The provisions won't last
for more than a day.

34:11.887 --> 34:14.481
It sounds like there's plenty of wildlife.

34:14.607 --> 34:17.201
I grew up in a place kind of like this.

34:17.327 --> 34:19.966
I don't think we're going to starve.

34:20.087 --> 34:23.762
And I can use a thruster assembly
from the pod to start a fire...

34:23.887 --> 34:25.605
boil some water.

34:29.167 --> 34:31.681
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

34:44.847 --> 34:46.724
That's the best you could do?

34:46.847 --> 34:49.360
There's very little dry wood.

34:49.487 --> 34:51.045
Keep looking.

34:55.246 --> 34:58.523
- What are you waiting for?
- I'm not your servant.

34:58.647 --> 35:01.605
You're the one who was raised
in a primitive environment.

35:01.727 --> 35:03.718
You find the wood.

35:03.847 --> 35:05.280
What's that supposed to mean?

35:05.407 --> 35:08.285
You're obviously better suited
to physical labour.

35:08.407 --> 35:10.921
In case you haven't noticed,
we're not in a palace.

35:11.047 --> 35:13.800
You said it yourself.
You won't survive without my help.

35:13.927 --> 35:15.883
So it seems to me
I'm the one in charge.

35:16.007 --> 35:18.282
The king of the swamp.
Now get your ass out there...

35:18.407 --> 35:20.204
and don't come back without dry wood.

35:20.327 --> 35:23.080
I should have you imprisoned
for speaking to me that way.

35:23.207 --> 35:26.438
You should give me a medal.
You'd be dead if it weren't for me.

35:26.567 --> 35:28.842
I'm beginning to think
that would be preferable.

35:28.967 --> 35:32.084
I doubt the commoners back home
would complain.

35:36.807 --> 35:38.286
How dare you!

35:38.407 --> 35:40.284
You're the one who took a swing at me.

35:40.407 --> 35:42.398
You insulted the First Monarch.

35:42.527 --> 35:46.076
I'm just a petty commoner, remember?
Raised on a...

36:44.487 --> 36:46.876
- What's wrong?
- A homing beacon.

36:47.007 --> 36:49.999
Unless I'm way off,
someone just locked onto it.

36:50.127 --> 36:52.482
- Your vessel?
- No way to tell.

38:10.807 --> 38:12.240
Leave him.

38:28.127 --> 38:30.038
Let's find his weapon.

38:34.967 --> 38:37.162
There's someone else here.

38:55.127 --> 38:56.446
Trip?

39:00.327 --> 39:02.204
Is this a bad time?

39:08.607 --> 39:12.077
Captain's Starlog, September 12, 2152.

39:12.687 --> 39:15.326
We've rendezvoused
with a Krios battle cruiser...

39:15.447 --> 39:18.359
which has taken the kidnappers
into custody.

39:18.967 --> 39:22.516
- So, when do you ascend?
- 246 days.

39:24.127 --> 39:25.276
It's a long shot...

39:25.407 --> 39:27.238
but maybe Enterprise
will get the chance...

39:27.367 --> 39:29.881
to visit Krios Prime before then.

39:30.007 --> 39:31.918
Of course, from what you told me...

39:32.047 --> 39:34.083
I doubt your family
would let me see you.

39:34.207 --> 39:36.118
I doubt they would.

39:36.247 --> 39:38.761
But once
I've been made First Monarch...

39:38.887 --> 39:41.959
I'll have the authority
to change the rules.

39:43.567 --> 39:45.683
What kind of changes?

39:46.007 --> 39:47.599
Come visit me.

39:48.567 --> 39:50.683
Perhaps you'll find out.
