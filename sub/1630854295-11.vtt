WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:03.170
Tonight, Tony Xu,

00:03.270 --> 00:04.571
founder of the largest food
delivery platform in America,

00:04.671 --> 00:06.573
DoorDash, joins the Tank.

00:06.673 --> 00:08.242
My entire
entrepreneurial career

00:08.342 --> 00:11.211
is figuring out how
to get mass distribution.

00:11.311 --> 00:13.914
We like to say that
the mosquito is our state bird.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.950
Reimagines the ancient wisdom
of my heritage.

00:17.084 --> 00:18.485
We're looking for somebody
that might want to show the world

00:18.585 --> 00:19.987
how Metric Mate works.

00:20.087 --> 00:21.488
That would be Mark.

00:21.588 --> 00:23.724
We actually have
700,000 customers to date.

00:23.824 --> 00:24.725
700,000?

00:24.825 --> 00:26.293
I didn't expect that.

00:26.393 --> 00:28.529
We're positioned to change
this industry entirely.

00:28.629 --> 00:30.664
Let's reinvest back in
the business and let's go for.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.833
No way. Okay, I gotta call
a little bit of BS there.

00:32.933 --> 00:34.801
You're the biggest blood
- sucking thing up here.

00:34.902 --> 00:37.638
I'm gonna DoorDash
up to you guys right now.

00:37.738 --> 00:39.606
Damn!

00:46.280 --> 00:47.948
First in the Tank

00:48.048 --> 00:52.085
is a product line to protect
you in the great outdoors.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.461
Hey.
My name is Nichole Powell,

01:01.562 --> 01:05.632
and I am seeking $250,000
for 5% of my company.

01:05.732 --> 01:07.968
Sharks, I grew
up in Minnesota,

01:08.068 --> 01:11.371
where we like to say that
the mosquito is our state bird.

01:11.471 --> 01:12.940
So...

01:13.040 --> 01:15.309
you can say I know a thing
or two about bug spray.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.843
Every time we
would go outside,

01:16.944 --> 01:19.212
my parents would cover
me and my brother

01:19.313 --> 01:21.782
with icky, sticky bug spray

01:21.882 --> 01:24.518
and coat us
in greasy chemical sunscreens.

01:24.618 --> 01:26.119
Ew.

01:26.219 --> 01:29.990
Years later, I realized I was
still using those same gross,

01:30.090 --> 01:32.893
artificial and environmentally
unfriendly products.

01:32.993 --> 01:35.629
And that is why
I created Kinfield,

01:35.729 --> 01:38.465
the modern outdoor brand
that is leading the revolution

01:38.565 --> 01:40.434
with clean bug
sprays that work

01:40.534 --> 01:42.369
and sun care the whole family
will love.

01:42.469 --> 01:44.738
Our first product
was Golden Hour.

01:44.838 --> 01:46.607
It's a DEET-free bug repellent

01:46.707 --> 01:49.509
made with citronella,
lemongrass, and vanilla

01:49.610 --> 01:53.146
to keep those pesky mosquitoes
away and smell amazing.

01:53.246 --> 01:56.483
Since then, we've launched
a biodegradable repellent wipe,

01:56.583 --> 01:57.951
recovery products,

01:58.051 --> 02:00.921
and a line of innovative
mineral sunscreens.

02:01.021 --> 02:03.890
So, Sharks, who's ready
to build a bug-free

02:03.991 --> 02:05.792
and sun-protected future
with me?

02:05.892 --> 02:09.429
In front of you are some
of our best-selling products,

02:09.529 --> 02:11.732
including our full bug
and sun line.

02:11.832 --> 02:14.201
This is an entire line,
you said,

02:14.301 --> 02:17.404
of sunscreen
mixed with bug repellent?

02:17.504 --> 02:19.172
No,
they're separate products.

02:19.272 --> 02:21.475
Okay.
So the orange products
that are in front of you

02:21.575 --> 02:22.843
are part of our bug line.

02:22.943 --> 02:24.945
Your bug repellent
smells so good.

02:25.045 --> 02:27.614
I'm surprised you don't
attract the mosquitoes.
Yeah, it doesn't smell
like bug repellant.

02:27.714 --> 02:29.583
And how does it
compare against DEET,

02:29.683 --> 02:32.219
in terms of preventing
the mosquitoes from biting us?

02:32.319 --> 02:35.756
So we had the protectiveness
of our repellent

02:35.856 --> 02:37.391
verified by
an independent lab.

02:37.491 --> 02:39.693
The test results showed us
that our bug repellent

02:39.793 --> 02:42.262
has an average of 3 hours
of protection time.

02:42.362 --> 02:43.864
How did you come up
with this idea?

02:43.964 --> 02:45.098
I went to Indonesia.

02:45.198 --> 02:47.200
It's an absolutely
beautiful country.

02:47.300 --> 02:49.870
But the combination of
the heat plus the rice paddies

02:49.970 --> 02:52.272
means that it is
an absolute mosquito paradise.

02:52.372 --> 02:55.308
And it was while I was there
that I actually came across

02:55.409 --> 02:57.177
this strain of citronella
that we now use

02:57.277 --> 02:58.612
for our bug repellent.

02:58.712 --> 03:01.982
Okay, so,
$250,000 for 5%

03:02.082 --> 03:06.053
Imputes.
...imputes a $5 million valuation.

03:06.153 --> 03:08.055
So you better have some sales.

03:08.155 --> 03:10.357
So I launched the brand
in the summer of 2019.

03:10.457 --> 03:11.792
We did $45,000 sales.

03:11.892 --> 03:12.793
Okay.

03:12.893 --> 03:15.295
2020,
we did $187,000 in sales.

03:15.395 --> 03:17.397
All direct to consumer?
Was all that through retail or...

03:17.497 --> 03:20.967
Almost all of that was online.
2021, we did $565,000 sales.

03:20.967 --> 03:22.869
- Yeah.
- There we go.
- All right.

03:22.969 --> 03:24.504
Did you make any money
in any of these years?

03:24.604 --> 03:26.840
Not quite yet.
'22?

03:26.940 --> 03:28.742
So, 2022, thus far this year,

03:28.842 --> 03:30.210
we've done $1.5 million
in sales,

03:30.310 --> 03:32.045
- Good for you.
- Good for you.
- And we are on track

03:32.145 --> 03:35.582
to do $2.1 million this year.
Do you think you'll make money
on the $1.5 million?

03:35.682 --> 03:36.883
We will not make money yet.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.251
We're positioned
to be profitable

03:38.351 --> 03:39.853
in about a year and a half.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.822
H-How much are you spending
on marketing?

03:41.922 --> 03:44.591
So our customer acquisition
cost right now is about $26.

03:44.691 --> 03:45.992
Oosh.
Okay.

03:46.093 --> 03:47.894
What I'm trying to figure out,
on every sale,

03:47.994 --> 03:49.296
are you losing
or making money?

03:49.396 --> 03:51.832
You told me $26
for customer acquisition costs.

03:51.932 --> 03:53.800
I don't know your average
margin across the product line.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.435
What is it?
The products
in front of you now

03:55.535 --> 03:58.605
are between
79% and 85% margins.

03:58.705 --> 04:02.309
Golden Hour costs us
about $4.53 to produce

04:02.409 --> 04:03.844
and we retail that for $22.

04:03.944 --> 04:05.579
Cloud Cover,
our body sunscreen,

04:05.679 --> 04:10.150
this one we pay $5.04,
and we retail it for $34.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.885
What's the average sale, then?

04:11.985 --> 04:15.088
Our average order value
on our website is $45.

04:15.188 --> 04:16.857
So $45.
Nichole, where are you
selling your product?

04:16.957 --> 04:20.794
So about 80% of our customers
buy directly with us online.

04:20.894 --> 04:24.965
But I still believe that being
in both dot-com and in retail

04:25.065 --> 04:27.033
is important to building
a healthy business.

04:27.134 --> 04:29.169
Why-- Why do you feel that
way? But-- But it seems like
you're growing so quickly.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.971
I mean, Nichole,
do you need to do that?

04:31.071 --> 04:33.740
I mean, you're controlling
your own destiny right now.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.609
We absolutely do.
And here's why.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.244
You need to have
the convenience.

04:37.344 --> 04:39.212
There are things that you need
because you're going outside.

04:39.312 --> 04:41.348
You have a park picnic
this weekend.

04:41.448 --> 04:44.117
And so retail has to be
a part of our journey.

04:44.217 --> 04:46.219
You're gonna be losing money
in retail, won't you?

04:46.319 --> 04:47.788
Not necessarily,
because w--

04:47.888 --> 04:49.923
Not necessarily is
a whole lot different than no.

04:51.424 --> 04:52.692
You still have
the distribution cost.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.261
You have the marketing
support cost.

04:54.361 --> 04:56.396
You have to advertise more,
not less.

04:56.496 --> 04:58.932
It's the fact that you're
gonna have to raise a lot more money

04:59.032 --> 05:02.369
for your R&D, for inventory,
for scaling, for advertising.

05:02.469 --> 05:03.770
Based off the deal
you're offering,

05:03.870 --> 05:06.006
we get diluted
to nothing, right?

05:06.106 --> 05:07.374
Not necessarily,

05:07.474 --> 05:09.376
because alongside
raising investor capital,

05:09.476 --> 05:11.511
we're also doing
lines of credit.

05:11.611 --> 05:13.280
How much debt
do you have right now?

05:13.380 --> 05:15.115
Less than half a million.
Half a million.

05:15.215 --> 05:17.317
Okay, well, that's real.
It varies by month
depending on what we're
paying.

05:17.417 --> 05:19.319
Look, you're very, very,
very impressive.

05:19.419 --> 05:20.821
But when it's
all said and done,

05:20.921 --> 05:23.290
where we'd start
versus where we'd end up--

05:23.390 --> 05:24.291
I just don't see it.

05:24.391 --> 05:26.526
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

05:26.626 --> 05:28.361
Nichole,
I'll make you an offer.

05:28.461 --> 05:29.930
Thank you.

05:30.030 --> 05:32.599
I'll give you $250,000
for 10%.

05:32.699 --> 05:35.802
And I hate to say it, but I
want a $2 royalty per product sold.

05:35.902 --> 05:37.804
Oh!
Mm.

05:37.904 --> 05:41.775
Oh. Savage.
Until it's paid back, only.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.643
Thank you for your offer.

05:43.743 --> 05:45.345
Well, now that we're throwing
royalties around...

05:45.445 --> 05:48.215
Oh, Mr. Royalty.
Yes, exactly.

05:48.315 --> 05:52.919
I'll do the $250,000 for 5%,
but it can never be diluted.

05:53.019 --> 05:56.456
In other words, Mr. Wonderful
always gets his 5%.

05:56.556 --> 05:58.992
And I will also
put a royalty on it.

05:59.092 --> 06:00.260
But not as greedy
as Barbara.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.996
I'll do $1.50 per unit

06:03.096 --> 06:05.799
until I get back $750,000.

06:05.899 --> 06:08.568
I'm tempted by your sales

06:08.668 --> 06:11.872
and your spectacular presentation.
That's like a double ratchet, Kevin.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.740
I mean,
if there's anybody up here

06:13.840 --> 06:16.910
that knows how to sell
a mosquito product,

06:17.010 --> 06:18.645
it's me.
Thank you, Lori.
It's me.

06:18.745 --> 06:22.315
Well, you're the
biggest blood-sucking
thing up here, but...

06:22.415 --> 06:23.750
He has more in common
with the mosquitoes, right?

06:23.850 --> 06:25.986
That's why I know
this product line.

06:26.086 --> 06:28.121
We're trying to
get rid of bloodsuckers.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.824
Okay.
I did Bug Bite Thing.

06:30.924 --> 06:33.126
Within a couple of years,
we did $25 million in sales

06:33.226 --> 06:35.262
and we're in 30,000 stores. Wow.

06:35.362 --> 06:36.963
And we've had offers
to sell already.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.632
So, here's my offer.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.201
I'm gonna give you
the $250,000.

06:41.301 --> 06:45.171
I'm only gonna take 5%, but
I am going to want a royalty.

06:45.272 --> 06:49.075
I'm going to want $4
per the item sold

06:49.175 --> 06:50.510
until I get--
Damn!

06:50.610 --> 06:51.945
- Wow!
- Wait. Wait. Listen.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.980
Whoa!
Until I get my money back.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.249
Just till you get
the money back?
That's almost as blood-sucking
as Kevin's offer.

06:56.349 --> 06:59.319
Until I get--
It's not. It's not.
Let me rephrase
how a royalty--

06:59.419 --> 07:02.889
When someone asks for a
royalty only until I'm paid back,

07:02.989 --> 07:04.291
that is the equivalent saying,

07:04.391 --> 07:05.892
"I don't really
want to give you any money."

07:05.992 --> 07:07.928
No, it's not.
Of course it.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.663
It's just, "Here's my money,
you give it right back."
No, I'm gonna--
Mark. Mark.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.531
You're not giving an offer,
so you should just...

07:11.631 --> 07:13.166
I'm just telling you
how royalties work.
...you know,
sit there and be quiet.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.901
Alright, Lori, why don't you
finish the offer?
So let me explain to you

07:15.001 --> 07:16.703
why I would do that.

07:16.803 --> 07:19.406
I don't want to work for free
for the next three years,

07:19.506 --> 07:21.775
for maybe down the road
when we sell it,

07:21.875 --> 07:23.343
I'm more than worth it.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.344
O'Leary: Well,
congratulations, Nichole.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.879
You have three offers.
Thank you.

07:25.979 --> 07:27.180
They're all commensurate
with the risk. Nichole.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.581
Nichole, I'm gonna add
one more offer

07:28.682 --> 07:29.849
into the-- into the mix
just because...

07:29.950 --> 07:31.651
Oh, wow.
Oh, Tony.

07:43.530 --> 07:44.965
One Shark is out.

07:45.065 --> 07:46.967
Nichole has three offers
on the table

07:47.067 --> 07:50.870
for her clean bug repellent
and sunscreen line Kinfield,

07:50.971 --> 07:52.706
but they all
involve a royalty.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.041
And Tony may also
be interested.

07:55.141 --> 07:57.077
Nichole, I'm gonna add
one more offer

07:57.177 --> 07:58.712
into the-- into the mix
just because...

07:58.812 --> 08:00.213
Oh, wow.
Oh, Tony.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.015
...while there are obviously
gonna be challenges

08:02.115 --> 08:04.317
heading into retail,
especially as we think about

08:04.417 --> 08:06.186
how to grow
this business,

08:06.286 --> 08:08.121
I actually think that
this business is gonna be

08:08.221 --> 08:09.389
worth quite a bit.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.792
So I actually want to be
with you more for the equity

08:12.892 --> 08:16.129
and not really try
to take money away from you.

08:16.229 --> 08:18.965
My offer is $250,000,
10%.

08:20.700 --> 08:21.735
No royalty?

08:21.835 --> 08:23.570
Straight equity,
clean deal,

08:23.670 --> 08:26.106
no ratchets,
no royalty.

08:26.206 --> 08:28.975
Let's reinvest back in the
business and let's go for it.

08:29.075 --> 08:30.310
Thank you for your offer.

08:30.410 --> 08:32.645
Four offers. Congratulations.

08:32.746 --> 08:35.615
Oh, my gosh.
Well, I would match his offer
if you prefer it.

08:35.715 --> 08:37.484
So Barbara's matching
him at 250,000 at 10%.

08:37.584 --> 08:39.686
So what is your offer now?
$250,000 at 10%.

08:39.786 --> 08:41.521
Flat equity deal.

08:41.621 --> 08:44.157
So, Tony did you
a big favor. Wow.

08:44.257 --> 08:46.760
I...am a bit overwhelmed.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.928
Well,
can you make a decision?

08:49.029 --> 08:51.731
So, the hard thing about
royalties right now

08:51.831 --> 08:55.168
is that we already
take a reduced margin

08:55.268 --> 08:56.536
when we go into retail.

08:56.636 --> 08:58.638
Nichole, this is exactly
why I gave you

08:58.738 --> 08:59.973
a straight equity deal.

09:00.073 --> 09:02.642
No loans, no interest,
no royalty,

09:02.742 --> 09:05.011
especially as we head
into a lower margin channel,

09:05.111 --> 09:07.580
that allows us
to get mass distribution.

09:07.680 --> 09:12.285
Tony and Barbara, would you
consider joining forces?

09:13.420 --> 09:15.255
Why not?
Let's do it.

09:15.355 --> 09:16.689
You're willing to give up
10%?

09:16.790 --> 09:20.226
For 10%, you could each do
$125,000

09:20.326 --> 09:21.661
and take 5%.
For 5%?

09:24.097 --> 09:25.598
You know what, Nichole?

09:25.698 --> 09:28.068
I'm sorry to say it.
I'm out.

09:30.003 --> 09:31.538
I've been there as well.

09:31.638 --> 09:33.473
I know exactly how
to help you scale,

09:33.573 --> 09:35.675
especially in
the operating side.
Mm-hmm.

09:35.775 --> 09:40.046
We'd be willing to do the
deal. $250,000, both of us,
10%.

09:43.349 --> 09:44.684
It's what
you just offered.

09:44.784 --> 09:46.152
Do we have a deal?

09:47.253 --> 09:48.555
You have a deal.
Yes!

09:48.655 --> 09:50.723
Deal.
Hallelujah.

09:51.624 --> 09:52.959
Good.
Congrats.

09:53.059 --> 09:55.328
I'm also a midwesterner.

09:55.428 --> 09:58.064
Illinois.
Oh, I'm in Minnesota.

09:58.164 --> 09:59.732
We're kin.
Thank you so much. Yes.

09:59.833 --> 10:02.168
You have my outfit on.
I have the same one.

10:02.268 --> 10:03.703
Congratulations.
You did a great job.

10:03.803 --> 10:04.971
Thank you, Nichole.
Thank you all.

10:05.071 --> 10:06.506
Truly, sincerely.

10:10.076 --> 10:12.479
I got an offer
from four Sharks.

10:12.579 --> 10:14.147
Oh, my gosh.

10:14.247 --> 10:15.982
I chose Barbara
and I chose Tony

10:16.082 --> 10:18.818
because their offer of equity

10:18.918 --> 10:21.354
really told me that they were
in it for the long haul

10:21.454 --> 10:22.789
and that they were
just as excited

10:22.889 --> 10:24.924
about where Kinfield is going
as I am.

10:25.024 --> 10:26.359
You know what, Tony?

10:26.459 --> 10:28.828
I've never gotten into bed
with a man I don't know before.

10:28.928 --> 10:30.363
This is exciting.
Yes, you have.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.699
Yes, you have, Barbara.
That's just not true.

10:32.799 --> 10:34.267
I'm insulted.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.304
I was born in China

10:38.404 --> 10:41.441
and my family immigrated
to the U. S. when I was 4.

10:41.541 --> 10:43.176
My parents wanted to come
to the U. S.

10:43.276 --> 10:44.944
to create a better life
for our family.

10:45.044 --> 10:46.913
My mom was a doctor in China,

10:47.013 --> 10:48.915
but the U. S. didn't
recognize her license.

10:49.015 --> 10:50.283
She had to give up
her entire career,

10:50.383 --> 10:51.684
work three jobs a day,

10:51.784 --> 10:53.720
including as a waitress
at a restaurant.

10:53.820 --> 10:56.256
My parents pretty much
had to sacrifice everything.

10:57.223 --> 10:59.125
I've had a very
non-linear career.

10:59.225 --> 11:01.494
I started by studying
cancer research at Berkeley,

11:01.594 --> 11:04.297
and then I decided to go
to Stanford to pursue my MBA.

11:04.397 --> 11:06.900
Stanford gave me the
opportunity to think about

11:07.000 --> 11:09.602
how technology can come
together with business.

11:09.702 --> 11:11.471
That's actually how I met
my co-founders,

11:11.571 --> 11:13.606
and we weren't necessarily
looking to start a company,

11:13.706 --> 11:16.409
but we were very excited to
help local business owners,

11:16.509 --> 11:18.378
a group that all of us
were passionate about.

11:18.478 --> 11:20.647
That's how DoorDash
came to be.

11:20.747 --> 11:23.883
One of the things we had heard
from many local business owners

11:23.983 --> 11:26.119
was that they could
not offer delivery.

11:26.219 --> 11:28.755
In fact, they would refuse.
To us, this was crazy.

11:28.855 --> 11:31.624
We were certainly not the
first company to launch delivery,

11:31.724 --> 11:34.827
but in many cases in business,
the goal isn't to be first.

11:34.928 --> 11:37.297
The goal is to be
the last person standing.

11:37.397 --> 11:39.332
Technology has always been
a great way

11:39.432 --> 11:40.667
to level the playing field,

11:40.767 --> 11:43.236
but usually the access
isn't evenly distributed.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.038
It usually starts with
the big companies.

11:45.138 --> 11:48.041
To us, DoorDash is about
democratizing access

11:48.141 --> 11:51.177
to technology and to empower
local economies.

11:52.478 --> 11:54.881
This pandemic hit,
our business plummeted,

11:54.981 --> 11:57.817
and all the business
came back through DoorDash.

11:57.917 --> 11:59.319
Local businesses
really represent

11:59.419 --> 12:01.654
the best of what America
has to offer.

12:01.754 --> 12:03.656
Businesses like
Honey's Kettle Kitchen.

12:03.756 --> 12:06.826
It's not just the business,
but the amazing community

12:06.926 --> 12:09.062
that that company has created
over the years.

12:09.162 --> 12:10.263
Dump it into our batter.

12:10.363 --> 12:12.232
Especially as DoorDash
gets bigger,

12:12.332 --> 12:13.466
I think it's even
more important

12:13.566 --> 12:15.235
that I stay closer
to our front lines.

12:15.335 --> 12:18.504
Every employee at DoorDash
does deliveries once a month.

12:18.605 --> 12:19.906
Even me.

12:20.006 --> 12:21.975
Today, DoorDash is the largest

12:22.075 --> 12:24.377
local delivery platform
in the United States.

12:24.477 --> 12:26.846
We serve
over 25 million customers,

12:26.946 --> 12:29.215
over 500,000 local businesses.

12:29.315 --> 12:31.017
There are over
a million drivers,

12:31.117 --> 12:33.553
and we've contributed
almost $70 billion

12:33.653 --> 12:36.556
of economic impact
in 2021 alone.

12:36.656 --> 12:38.858
The odds of someone
coming to this country

12:38.958 --> 12:40.426
with $200 in the bank,

12:40.526 --> 12:42.729
to them building
a multi-billion dollar company

12:42.829 --> 12:45.498
and, more importantly,
a positive change for the future

12:45.598 --> 12:48.101
is only something
that can happen in this country.

12:48.201 --> 12:49.869
And it is my American dream.

12:50.870 --> 12:53.306
"Shark Tank" is one of
the greatest platforms

12:53.406 --> 12:55.675
to level the playing field
for the underdogs.

12:55.775 --> 12:58.444
It gives equal access
to talent everywhere,

12:58.544 --> 13:00.580
and I'm so excited
to be a part of it.

13:00.680 --> 13:02.849
Part of my drive
is how I grew up,

13:02.949 --> 13:06.452
not having very much and
trying to make something out
of the lot

13:06.552 --> 13:07.887
that I was given in life.

13:07.987 --> 13:10.857
A lot of that drive comes from
wanting to see success in others

13:10.957 --> 13:12.592
and making sure
that I can give back

13:12.692 --> 13:15.295
so that collectively
we can all be successful.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.609
Next up is an accessory

13:29.709 --> 13:33.346
designed to help you
maximize your workouts.

13:42.221 --> 13:44.157
Hey, Sharks. I'm MT.

13:44.257 --> 13:45.458
And these are
my business partners,

13:45.558 --> 13:46.859
Braxton and Ecleamus.

13:46.959 --> 13:49.295
And we're here seeking
$100,000

13:49.395 --> 13:52.298
for 5% of our company
Metric Mate.

13:52.398 --> 13:54.100
Hey, guys,
this is pretty tense.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.635
Think I'm gonna go get
some reps in and get pumped.

13:55.735 --> 13:56.636
Whoo!

13:56.736 --> 13:58.271
Let's go.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.206
We're gonna flash back
a few years ago

14:00.306 --> 14:04.077
to watch Braxton do this
workout before Metric Mate.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.178
All right,
he's in the gym.

14:05.278 --> 14:06.679
He's got a pen
and paper in hand.

14:06.779 --> 14:09.749
Looks like he's gonna write
down his exercises and his reps.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.952
Great idea,
if it was 1962.

14:13.052 --> 14:14.687
Come on.
Pen and paper?

14:14.787 --> 14:16.022
Strike one for that,

14:16.122 --> 14:18.091
and throw in another strike
for the tight T-shirt.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.759
Okay, moving on.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.562
It looks like he didn't even
bring the paper from last time.

14:22.662 --> 14:25.431
He's guessing about
everything. What is he doing
today?

14:25.531 --> 14:27.667
Is he
even making progress?

14:27.767 --> 14:29.268
Sorry, Braxton.
Strike three.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.737
You're out.

14:32.205 --> 14:35.641
Sharks, let me introduce you
to your new best friend--

14:35.742 --> 14:37.143
Metric Mate,

14:37.243 --> 14:40.780
a patented platform that
allows you to turn any gym equipment

14:40.880 --> 14:42.548
into smart equipment.

14:42.648 --> 14:46.552
Not only does it seamlessly
track your reps and your sets,

14:46.652 --> 14:49.422
the platform analyzes your
workout to provide more useful,

14:49.522 --> 14:51.691
here we go, metrics

14:51.791 --> 14:54.861
like calorie burn,
intensity, force, fatigue,

14:54.961 --> 14:57.530
even if you're at risk
for injury.

14:57.630 --> 14:59.132
All of this information
can be shared

14:59.232 --> 15:00.633
with your personal trainer,

15:00.733 --> 15:02.702
your coach,
your physical therapist,

15:02.802 --> 15:05.705
even millions of your
social media followers.

15:05.805 --> 15:07.540
All to increase accountability,

15:07.640 --> 15:10.576
but more importantly,
to promote healthier lifestyles.

15:10.676 --> 15:14.814
Sharks, invest in Metric Mate
so we can make sure your bottom

15:14.914 --> 15:17.250
and your bottom line
get in shape.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.685
Now, we've got the Metric Mate
technology set up,

15:19.786 --> 15:21.087
and we're looking
for somebody

15:21.187 --> 15:23.189
that might want to show
the world how Metric Mate works.

15:23.289 --> 15:24.824
- That would be Mark.
- You got it, big guy.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.593
So go ahead, join us at
the shoulder press machine.

15:27.693 --> 15:30.630
Now, two of the things that
Metric Mate takes into account

15:30.730 --> 15:31.998
is, one, you're tempo.

15:32.098 --> 15:34.066
And two, we're looking
for a full range of motion.

15:34.167 --> 15:36.302
All right, Mark,
all you have to do

15:36.402 --> 15:37.937
is follow the prompts
as you hear it.

15:38.037 --> 15:40.306
Okay.
It's gonna automatically
connect to the device

15:40.406 --> 15:42.041
and all that after that.

15:42.141 --> 15:44.143
<i>Mark, begin your workout.</i>

15:44.243 --> 15:46.579
One.
So if you're not doing
the rep correctly,

15:46.679 --> 15:48.581
you don't get
your rep count, right?
Got two.

15:48.681 --> 15:51.384
So you got to burst on that
up. Oh. Got it.

15:51.484 --> 15:52.418
And then...
<i>Just one more.</i>

15:52.518 --> 15:54.020
That's cool.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.489
<i>Mark's set complete.
But that was lackluster.</i>

15:56.589 --> 15:58.324
<i>Are you really a Shark?</i>

16:01.194 --> 16:02.228
Machine's working.

16:03.362 --> 16:04.630
I love it.
Thanks so much.

16:04.730 --> 16:06.299
So there's a device that goes
on the machine,

16:06.399 --> 16:08.067
and there's an app
that you guys are building?

16:08.167 --> 16:11.037
That's correct. So the
device is what we use
to collect the data...

16:11.137 --> 16:13.806
Yeah.
...that no other type
of equipment has.

16:13.906 --> 16:15.508
But in particular,
if you're traveling

16:15.608 --> 16:17.076
or if you're at
a different gym,

16:17.176 --> 16:20.179
putting your pin in and
letting it connect to Bluetooth

16:20.279 --> 16:21.547
was actually pretty slick.

16:21.647 --> 16:24.717
Now, the question I have is,
can I do it on a phone?

16:24.817 --> 16:26.619
Because being able to see it
is important.

16:26.719 --> 16:28.554
Absolutely.
So, most of the time

16:28.654 --> 16:30.089
you're using it
on your mobile phone.

16:30.189 --> 16:32.425
But also, you could have it
in your pocket.

16:32.525 --> 16:33.526
You have
your headphones in.

16:33.626 --> 16:34.927
And it's talking to you, right?

16:35.027 --> 16:36.329
You're trying to--
You're using
our guided workout.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.898
So our Metric Mate assistant
is giving you the instructions.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.767
Right.
Besides being maybe
health enthusiasts,

16:41.868 --> 16:44.270
are you engineers
or how'd you get into this?

16:44.370 --> 16:46.405
Between the three of us,
we have eight degrees.

16:46.506 --> 16:47.773
Eight?
Eight?

16:47.874 --> 16:50.376
Wow.
Yeah, we have 15-plus
years experience

16:50.476 --> 16:53.212
in terms of software,
manufacturing, supply chain.

16:53.312 --> 16:55.081
And we got a patent lawyer
over here.

16:55.181 --> 16:58.150
So you guys are real slouches.
No question about it. Yeah.

16:58.251 --> 17:00.520
So, have you tested
how accurate the device is,

17:00.620 --> 17:03.456
or is it mostly
a recording product?

17:03.556 --> 17:05.825
Most of the data that we get
is unique data

17:05.925 --> 17:07.727
because everything else
is a wearable.

17:07.827 --> 17:09.028
You're getting
the biometrics,

17:09.128 --> 17:10.630
but you're not getting what
you're actually doing

17:10.730 --> 17:11.631
on the machine.

17:11.731 --> 17:13.065
We're collecting
all of it

17:13.165 --> 17:15.668
and using that information,
along with the biometrics,

17:15.768 --> 17:18.037
to bring together
a full, holistic picture.

17:18.137 --> 17:19.872
Okay, well, that's
an interesting
statement right there.

17:19.972 --> 17:21.641
So you say "along
with the biometrics."

17:21.741 --> 17:25.177
So you're integrating to
iwatches and what other
devices?

17:25.278 --> 17:26.879
'Cause that's where
the biometrics are coming from.

17:26.979 --> 17:28.814
Yeah, we've built
the technology to allow that.

17:28.915 --> 17:32.051
Right now, our focus is
working with personal trainers

17:32.151 --> 17:34.387
to provide a service
that is unparalleled.

17:34.487 --> 17:36.188
Like, I-I work the gym
in every station.

17:36.289 --> 17:37.356
I want this thing.

17:37.456 --> 17:38.758
Why do I have to have
a trainer involved?

17:38.858 --> 17:40.126
That's why
we're here today.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.762
So, our funding
right now is limited.

17:42.862 --> 17:44.864
So our focus has been
on personal trainers

17:44.964 --> 17:47.166
because they work
with multiple clients.

17:47.266 --> 17:49.502
That means the client has to
go to the gym with the trainer

17:49.602 --> 17:50.736
'cause he's got the device.

17:50.836 --> 17:53.072
At this point.
Now, once we get the funding,

17:53.172 --> 17:55.241
we're able to proliferate
the hardware

17:55.341 --> 17:57.443
to now we're able to make
that available to our users.

17:57.543 --> 17:59.145
So what does it cost you
to make right now?

17:59.245 --> 18:00.947
It costs us $99 to produce

18:01.047 --> 18:02.848
at a quantity
of 1,000 units.

18:02.949 --> 18:04.750
And so we can retail it
for $199,

18:04.850 --> 18:06.285
which is
what we plan to do.

18:06.385 --> 18:08.888
Now that we're moving towards
being able to put the device

18:08.988 --> 18:10.323
in the hands of the trainers,

18:10.423 --> 18:12.625
we've got 10 devices
that we're looking to sell.

18:12.725 --> 18:14.393
We've sold five
before we got on here.

18:14.493 --> 18:16.228
And the only reason
we didn't sell the other five

18:16.329 --> 18:17.997
is 'cause they're sitting
over here on the stage.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.865
So as soon as we
get back to Atlanta,

18:19.966 --> 18:22.101
those will be packaged
and sent off to trainers

18:22.201 --> 18:24.503
to start the revenue
- generation process.

18:24.604 --> 18:27.873
So if I'm looking at this
as just a consumer product,

18:27.974 --> 18:31.944
I can just purchase it
for $199 online at your
website?

18:32.044 --> 18:33.245
So, as of right now,

18:33.346 --> 18:35.615
we have preorders available
for the end consumer.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.183
What if I don't want any--
But what about
the biggest barriers of entry

18:37.283 --> 18:39.051
for going directly
to the consumer

18:39.151 --> 18:40.853
is government certification.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.989
So we have about
five government certifications

18:43.089 --> 18:45.758
that are between
$150,000 and $200,000

18:45.858 --> 18:48.928
that are preventing us
from being able to send
this direct to consumer,

18:49.028 --> 18:51.230
which is why that
B2B2C model

18:51.330 --> 18:53.165
that we're doing with the gyms
and the personal trainers

18:53.265 --> 18:54.166
makes sense.

18:54.266 --> 18:55.801
What if I don't want
any of that?

18:55.901 --> 18:57.403
You know,
the cool part to me is,

18:57.503 --> 19:00.473
I just want to use this as my
pin and it just tracks my reps.

19:00.573 --> 19:01.907
Mark, I think what
you're asking is,

19:02.008 --> 19:03.843
is there a way for just you
to use it on your own?
Yeah.

19:03.943 --> 19:05.177
That's what I want it for.

19:05.277 --> 19:07.113
I think that's the business
here, guys. Yes.

19:07.213 --> 19:10.216
I mean, I think you have
a big business in consumers,

19:10.316 --> 19:11.784
but a small business
with trainers.

19:11.884 --> 19:14.186
Look, guys,
I think it's a great idea

19:14.286 --> 19:16.022
as a consumer product first.

19:16.122 --> 19:18.891
I'm really, really afraid
of all the analytics.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.460
Basic analytics are okay--
here's how many reps you did.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.396
This was the machine
you were on, right?

19:23.496 --> 19:25.464
But when you start
getting into real analytics

19:25.564 --> 19:27.533
where you have to use
the biometrics,

19:27.633 --> 19:31.237
the engineering and analytics
behind that are hard.

19:31.337 --> 19:32.571
Really, really hard.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.374
To me, that makes
the business worse, not better.

19:35.474 --> 19:37.276
And so for those reasons,
I'm out.

19:37.376 --> 19:38.711
You guys, listen,

19:38.811 --> 19:42.014
I understand your first model
is to go with the trainers,

19:42.114 --> 19:44.183
and I respect that
you know your business.

19:44.283 --> 19:45.885
But I think
that this would be

19:45.985 --> 19:47.753
just really great
if you simplified it

19:47.853 --> 19:49.822
and just made it
for consumers.

19:49.922 --> 19:51.991
Well, help us to do that,
Lori. T-That's why we're here.

19:52.091 --> 19:54.460
Well, I actually
am not a huge workout queen.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.929
I wish you good luck,
but I'm out.

19:57.029 --> 20:00.700
Our roadblock for the consumer
is the funding.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.268
So we're not opposed
to it.

20:02.368 --> 20:04.170
The personal trainer
is where we have access to.

20:04.270 --> 20:05.738
What bothers me
about the deal is,

20:05.838 --> 20:08.374
I don't know if the consumer
is gonna like it.

20:08.474 --> 20:10.543
You really haven't given us
any evidence.

20:10.643 --> 20:12.678
They may. They may not.
I don't know.

20:12.778 --> 20:14.780
It's early.
So I'm out.

20:14.880 --> 20:18.718
Yeah, look, guys, I can see
myself trying a product

20:18.818 --> 20:21.053
that actually does that,
but my strong advice is

20:21.153 --> 20:22.722
get it into the hands
of consumers.

20:22.822 --> 20:24.156
Let them tell you
what's working.

20:24.256 --> 20:26.425
Maybe all they want
is just instant gratification

20:26.525 --> 20:28.294
to know how many reps
they've done, right?
Understood.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.896
But for now,
I think it's a bit early for me,

20:30.996 --> 20:33.232
and for those reasons,
I'm out.

20:33.332 --> 20:34.867
O'Leary: So I have a company
called PRx.

20:34.967 --> 20:37.036
PRx has sold millions
and millions of dollars

20:37.136 --> 20:38.604
of gym equipment.
We've heard of it.

20:38.704 --> 20:40.039
We've been very successful.

20:40.139 --> 20:42.374
We're building our own plant
to manufacture now... Wow.

20:42.475 --> 20:44.744
...because supply chain
is so broken.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.812
So here's the offer
I'm gonna make you.

20:46.912 --> 20:49.882
I'll give you
the $100,000 you asked for.

20:49.982 --> 20:53.652
However, I want to take
advantage of my PRx investment.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.254
So, we're gonna manufacture.

20:55.354 --> 20:57.223
That's the contingency
right here.

20:57.323 --> 21:00.893
And I want--
Are you ready for it?

21:00.993 --> 21:02.027
25%.

21:02.128 --> 21:04.130
What?!
Oof.

21:04.897 --> 21:07.967
You guys--
You guys need me so badly...
Kevin, you savage.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.435
...and I know
I have leverage here.

21:09.535 --> 21:11.904
You should counter.
Lori, you didn't
make an offer.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.741
I'm the fourth partner.
I get a quarter.

21:15.841 --> 21:17.276
Unfortunately,
for 25%,

21:17.376 --> 21:19.512
that's just too high for us
because we put in too much.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.547
We have the patents, we have
the intellectual property,

21:21.647 --> 21:22.915
we have
the software guy.

21:23.015 --> 21:24.350
Is our counteroffer?

21:24.450 --> 21:25.918
We want to do $100,000,

21:26.018 --> 21:29.955
but we also want to add
in $150,000 line of credit

21:30.055 --> 21:31.657
that we can
take advantage of.

21:31.757 --> 21:34.193
And we want to come back
at 12.5%.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.661
No,
I'm not doing that deal.

21:35.761 --> 21:39.231
If this needs more capital,
like all of my companies,

21:39.331 --> 21:40.633
I'll figure it out.

21:40.733 --> 21:42.234
But if you want to scale
this thing,

21:42.334 --> 21:44.737
we got to sell
100,000 units in a year.

21:44.837 --> 21:48.674
For $100,000,
the highest we could go is
7.5%.

21:50.509 --> 21:51.977
Would you be
willing to increase?

21:52.077 --> 21:54.380
No. What I want to get is
a quarter of the business

21:54.480 --> 21:57.216
'cause I'm now getting
on a journey.
Guys, look.
Kevin's very direct.

21:57.316 --> 21:58.884
If there was wiggle room,
he'd be wiggling.

21:58.984 --> 22:00.019
Yeah.
And he's not.

22:00.119 --> 22:01.520
So you guys
have got to make a decision.

22:03.255 --> 22:04.557
I'll give you one quick
piece of advice

22:04.657 --> 22:06.058
then you have to make
a decision.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.660
Where are you gonna be
a year from now

22:07.760 --> 22:10.529
if you do get the money
or if you don't?

22:10.629 --> 22:12.298
Even though
it may feel painful

22:12.398 --> 22:15.034
because of all you've done
to get this far,

22:15.134 --> 22:18.838
75% of a watermelon is a whole
lot better than 100% of a grape.

22:18.938 --> 22:20.840
Definitely
appreciate your offer.

22:20.940 --> 22:24.210
We're gonna counter
if you could do 200K for 20%.

22:24.310 --> 22:26.712
And we would love to work with
PRx to be able to make sure

22:26.812 --> 22:28.981
that we can get this
thing distributed as
quickly as possible.

22:29.081 --> 22:32.618
The offer I made
was $100,000 for 25%.

22:32.718 --> 22:34.186
You either accept it
or you don't.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.459
We thank you for
the opportunity.

22:40.559 --> 22:41.594
I appreciate.
Thank you.

22:41.694 --> 22:44.129
Damn, guys. Wow.

22:44.230 --> 22:45.798
Sometimes
it doesn't work out.

22:45.898 --> 22:47.299
God.

22:48.334 --> 22:49.435
Indeed.
Good luck, guys.

22:49.535 --> 22:50.636
Thanks, guys.
Best of luck.

22:50.736 --> 22:52.404
Good luck, guys.

22:55.941 --> 22:58.310
You good?
Let's go do this thing.

22:58.410 --> 23:00.813
We have no regrets walking out
without a deal today.

23:00.913 --> 23:01.881
We know what we're worth.

23:01.981 --> 23:03.582
We can find investors
in those areas

23:03.682 --> 23:05.150
that can service us
the same way.

23:05.251 --> 23:07.353
But the one thing
that we won't be able to do

23:07.453 --> 23:08.554
if we went out
with that deal

23:08.654 --> 23:10.222
is say that we stood
on our values

23:10.322 --> 23:11.891
and what we came here for.

23:11.991 --> 23:13.259
Honestly,
it was on them.

23:13.359 --> 23:15.194
No, it really wasn't.
They've worked really hard.

23:15.294 --> 23:17.129
They have three utility
patents. That doesn't count.

23:17.229 --> 23:19.398
How hard-- Everybody
that comes here--
It's probable cost them
a lot of money.

23:19.498 --> 23:21.100
There's no b--
They didn't want to
give away 25%.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.102
I get it. Nobody does.
They went to 20%.

23:23.202 --> 23:25.404
Well, I'll tell you, the good
news is I'm gonna buy one.

23:25.504 --> 23:27.806
I don't have to buy the
company to buy the product.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.786
Next up, a modern twist

23:40.886 --> 23:43.756
on a traditional beverage
with health benefits.

23:52.464 --> 23:54.566
Hi, Sharks.
My name's Rosa.

23:54.667 --> 23:57.202
I'm from San Francisco, California.

23:57.303 --> 23:59.405
Growing up as a little girl
in China,

23:59.505 --> 24:01.941
Grandma taught me the
philosophy of food as medicine

24:02.041 --> 24:03.242
from an early age.

24:03.342 --> 24:05.311
She always brewed
these healing tonics

24:05.411 --> 24:07.780
with a symphony of wild herbs
and botanicals

24:07.880 --> 24:09.315
that were great for my health.

24:09.415 --> 24:11.050
They worked wonders for me,

24:11.150 --> 24:13.819
soothing my stomach
and lifting my spirit.

24:13.919 --> 24:18.257
Fast-forward to grown-up me,
I worked a lot of stressful jobs

24:18.357 --> 24:20.492
and started to feel
the effect on my body,

24:20.592 --> 24:22.561
mostly in my gut.

24:22.661 --> 24:24.897
So I returned to Grandma's
homemade tonics,

24:24.997 --> 24:28.467
and, Sharks, I became
a true believer in gut health

24:28.567 --> 24:30.669
and had to share her wisdom
with the world.

24:30.769 --> 24:33.205
And that's when I brewed up wildwonder,

24:33.305 --> 24:35.341
a sparkling drink
that reimagines

24:35.441 --> 24:37.643
the healing tonics
of my heritage

24:37.743 --> 24:41.347
by combining herbal wisdom
with whimsical flavors.

24:41.447 --> 24:43.749
Our drinks have all the
gut-supporting superfoods

24:43.849 --> 24:47.286
your body craves,
50% less sugar than kombucha,

24:47.386 --> 24:49.488
and best of all,
is the first drink

24:49.588 --> 24:52.358
that combines both probiotics
and prebiotics.

24:52.458 --> 24:54.426
Why?
Because better gut health

24:54.526 --> 24:57.396
should be as easy
as popping over a can.

24:58.964 --> 25:00.599
Sip on our Strawberry Passion

25:00.699 --> 25:03.235
for a perfectly sweet
and tart refresher.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.537
Dip into our dreamy
pink drink Guava Rose

25:05.637 --> 25:07.473
for both floral and fruity.

25:07.573 --> 25:10.242
Try our Peach Ginger that
gives you all the peachy vibes

25:10.342 --> 25:11.577
with a zesty kick.

25:11.677 --> 25:13.746
Or indulge your senses
with Mango Gold

25:13.846 --> 25:16.181
for a tropical
and refreshing taste.

25:16.281 --> 25:18.050
Sharks, food is
my love language

25:18.150 --> 25:20.953
and I don't believe
in giving up taste for health.

25:21.053 --> 25:24.289
I am seeking
$500,000 for 5%...

25:24.390 --> 25:25.657
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

25:25.758 --> 25:27.960
...of this gut-supporting
and immune-boosting
superdrink.

25:28.060 --> 25:31.263
So who's ready to put
a modern twist on ancient wisdom

25:31.363 --> 25:34.633
and join me in drinking
our way to better gut health?

25:34.733 --> 25:37.669
Sharks, in front of you
are wildwonder drinks

25:37.770 --> 25:39.772
to sip on and enjoy.

25:39.872 --> 25:41.907
We fresh-brew all the herbs
and botanicals

25:42.007 --> 25:43.542
and pair that with fruit.

25:43.642 --> 25:46.145
I just drank the Guava Rose,
which tasted to me like

25:46.245 --> 25:49.214
rose water with a little bit
of bitterness, right?

25:49.314 --> 25:51.417
But we're talking probiotics. Yup.

25:51.517 --> 25:54.753
Every can has five grams
of prebiotic fiber.

25:54.853 --> 25:56.255
That's unusual
in a drink.

25:56.355 --> 25:58.957
We're a more holistic way
to approach gut health.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.426
Most companies out there,

26:00.526 --> 26:02.194
like kombucha,
drinking vinegar,

26:02.294 --> 26:05.097
first of all, they have that
really acquired fermented taste,

26:05.197 --> 26:07.366
and that's not serving
the average customer.

26:07.466 --> 26:09.401
I agree with that.
And we're here to really
expand the market

26:09.501 --> 26:11.103
with no fermented taste

26:11.203 --> 26:13.372
and is a healthy alternative
to soda as well.

26:13.472 --> 26:17.309
So as you can notice,
every can has 35 calories only.

26:17.409 --> 26:21.447
It's incredible.
90% less sugar than soda and
50% less sugar than kombucha.

26:21.547 --> 26:23.315
And there's nothing
artificial in it.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.451
Everything is organic
certified as well.

26:25.551 --> 26:27.486
It's very clean ingredients.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.221
Rosa, didn't we go
to school together?

26:29.321 --> 26:31.256
Yeah, we did.
Thank you for remembering.

26:31.356 --> 26:33.125
To tell me your background
a bit more.

26:33.225 --> 26:36.161
So, um, yes, we both
went to business school,

26:36.261 --> 26:37.596
not the same class.

26:37.696 --> 26:40.232
So let me tell you a little
more about my personal background.

26:40.332 --> 26:42.134
I grew up in China.

26:42.234 --> 26:43.669
My grandparents
actually raised me

26:43.769 --> 26:45.437
for the first 12 years
of my life...

26:45.537 --> 26:48.240
Wow.
...while my parents immigrated
to the U. S.

26:48.340 --> 26:50.275
I came to the States at age 12

26:50.375 --> 26:52.945
with zero knowledge
of the English language.

26:53.045 --> 26:55.814
Within three years, I joined
my high school's debate team. Wow.

26:55.914 --> 26:58.183
So then I was only a sophomore
from my college

26:58.283 --> 27:01.954
to secure a finance internship
from Goldman Sachs

27:02.054 --> 27:03.489
in their New York headquarters.

27:03.589 --> 27:05.891
After I graduated,
I worked in

27:05.991 --> 27:07.326
private equity
and venture investing,

27:07.426 --> 27:09.728
so I know a lot
about scaling businesses

27:09.828 --> 27:11.296
with capital efficiency

27:11.396 --> 27:13.298
and making a return
on your dollar.

27:14.633 --> 27:16.735
I launched wildwonder
in 2020.

27:16.835 --> 27:19.838
I actually had large POs going
out to offices like Facebook

27:19.938 --> 27:21.974
and Google,
and COVID happened.

27:22.074 --> 27:25.043
So that actually wiped out
my entire revenue stream.

27:25.144 --> 27:28.947
It was really a hard time,
but I basically got to work.

27:29.047 --> 27:33.218
Within three months, I knocked
on 200 grocery store doors,

27:33.318 --> 27:35.487
got my website up and running. Wow.

27:35.587 --> 27:36.855
And by the end of year one,

27:36.955 --> 27:38.991
I was carried
by over 100 stores,

27:39.091 --> 27:40.459
including our regional
Whole Foods.

27:40.559 --> 27:41.960
Wow.
Good for you.

27:42.060 --> 27:43.228
O'Leary:
I'm always fascinated

27:43.328 --> 27:45.097
when someone comes into
"Shark Tank"

27:45.197 --> 27:49.701
with a beverage deal with a
valuation of 10 million bucks.

27:49.801 --> 27:52.538
Because I know how hard it is
to get distribution,

27:52.638 --> 27:55.374
and 100 stores,
with all due respect,

27:55.474 --> 27:57.809
is nothing in terms
of what you have to achieve.

27:57.910 --> 27:58.911
But that was last year, right?

27:59.011 --> 28:00.412
That was 2020.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.014
Okay.
O'Leary: What do you have now?
How many stores?

28:02.114 --> 28:05.651
So, year-to-date,
we've generated over
$1.4 million revenue.

28:05.751 --> 28:07.920
We're at a run rate
of $2.5 million right now.

28:08.020 --> 28:09.788
We also have some
really exciting launches

28:09.888 --> 28:11.356
coming up
in the next 30 days.

28:11.456 --> 28:12.891
So are you gonna make
any money this year?

28:12.991 --> 28:15.994
At this scale,
we're not net profitable.

28:16.094 --> 28:18.330
Food and beverage
is a gross margin game.

28:18.430 --> 28:21.466
I'm very focused on increasing
our gross margins.

28:21.567 --> 28:22.868
Rosa,
what do you sell them for,

28:22.968 --> 28:24.570
and what does it cost you
to make them?

28:24.670 --> 28:26.505
It cost 90 cents to make.

28:26.605 --> 28:30.709
I retail for $3.49,
and within a year's time

28:30.809 --> 28:33.145
we can get
that cost down to 70 cents.

28:33.245 --> 28:35.180
How much money have you
put into the business?

28:35.280 --> 28:37.583
We raised, last year,
$2.1 million.

28:37.683 --> 28:39.151
That's all you've
raised so far?

28:39.251 --> 28:42.154
So we also have investors
putting in money right now.

28:42.254 --> 28:43.922
What-- What valuation
are these raises at?

28:44.022 --> 28:46.425
Last year we raised on a SAFE,

28:46.525 --> 28:50.028
is a pre-money SAFE
$6 million cap. Mm.

28:50.128 --> 28:53.031
Look, I admire you.
Your story's incredible.

28:53.131 --> 28:54.433
The product's fantastic.

28:54.533 --> 28:57.202
One of the best, I must say,
I've ever tried in the Tank,

28:57.302 --> 29:00.939
but at 5%, I don't even get
out of bed for 5%.

29:01.039 --> 29:02.441
For me, I'm out.

29:02.541 --> 29:03.742
Sorry to hear that.

29:03.842 --> 29:07.112
For me, the risk
isn't matching the reward.

29:07.212 --> 29:10.482
I think you're in a very,
very, very big market.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.784
So I'm sorry.
I'm out.

29:12.884 --> 29:14.920
I'm sorry to hear that.
I can't stand kombucha.

29:15.020 --> 29:16.255
I can drink this
all day long.

29:16.355 --> 29:19.191
And the utility of it,
right, with the fiber

29:19.291 --> 29:20.726
and drinkability.

29:20.826 --> 29:22.160
Which one is it that I just
drink the whole thing of?

29:22.261 --> 29:23.562
The Strawberry Passion?
Yeah.

29:23.662 --> 29:25.297
I'll order it.
It was really, really good.

29:25.397 --> 29:26.665
Thank you.
But the amount of money

29:26.765 --> 29:28.967
that you're gonna have
to continue to raise--

29:28.967 --> 29:32.137
Entrepreneurs tend to kind of
try to find an equilibrium

29:32.237 --> 29:33.405
of how much
they want to keep

29:33.505 --> 29:35.340
versus how much they can
raise. That's right. Yeah.

29:35.440 --> 29:36.575
And it's very,
very difficult.

29:36.675 --> 29:40.212
It makes it for
a small investor, just 5%?

29:40.312 --> 29:42.414
It makes it really,
really hard for us

29:42.514 --> 29:44.249
to participate
in all the upside.

29:44.349 --> 29:45.684
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.185
Thank you, Mark.
You're welcome.

29:47.286 --> 29:50.822
I think your product presents
as well as you did today.

29:50.922 --> 29:52.190
Flawless, really.

29:52.291 --> 29:54.359
I know you invest--
You invested in some beverages.

29:54.459 --> 29:56.528
I did. Twice.
There could be some synergies, Barbara.

29:56.628 --> 30:00.565
Listen, the first time
I cried when I lost some money,

30:00.666 --> 30:04.403
the second time I put in more
money to follow my bad money

30:04.503 --> 30:05.771
and lost that, too.

30:05.871 --> 30:09.041
And then I wrote
a note to my attorney,

30:09.141 --> 30:10.609
signed it,
had it notarized,

30:10.709 --> 30:13.745
saying, "Kill me if I ever go
into another beverage
company."

30:15.047 --> 30:16.748
And I'm afraid he would kill
me, actually.

30:16.848 --> 30:18.116
I'm out.

30:18.216 --> 30:19.184
Thank you.

30:19.284 --> 30:20.852
Well, Tony.

30:23.422 --> 30:25.157
I do think, like
some of the other Sharks,

30:25.257 --> 30:27.659
I think this is a category
where you kind of

30:27.759 --> 30:30.295
have to achieve
a minimum scale...
Mm-hmm.

30:30.395 --> 30:32.764
...before it actually
has a chance. Yeah.

30:32.864 --> 30:35.634
Your ask was $500,000
at 5%.
Yeah.

30:35.734 --> 30:40.505
My-- My counter to you
is the $500,000 at 9%.

30:40.605 --> 30:42.641
And that's
my final offer.

30:42.741 --> 30:45.210
You know,
I'm not a beverage guy,

30:45.310 --> 30:49.815
but I do understand scaling
capital efficient businesses...

30:49.915 --> 30:53.518
Mm-hmm.
...in a very sequential way to
have a chance at that success.

30:53.618 --> 30:55.487
And I think
that's what you need.

30:55.587 --> 30:59.224
So the last round we raised,
pre-money SAFE,

30:59.324 --> 31:00.926
so $6 million cap.

31:01.026 --> 31:03.395
I'm happy
to meet you somewhere

31:03.495 --> 31:05.931
just so that I don't
go under that.

31:07.933 --> 31:12.904
Would you be able to do
$500,000, 6%,

31:13.004 --> 31:14.973
but I'll give you
a 3% advisory shares?

31:15.073 --> 31:17.876
Just so it doesn't hurt
my-- my valuation as much.

31:17.976 --> 31:19.745
But you'll get
the same amount.

31:22.981 --> 31:23.949
Done.
All right!

31:24.049 --> 31:25.217
We got a deal!
Good job, guys.

31:25.317 --> 31:27.219
Awesome.
Oh, my gosh.

31:27.319 --> 31:28.487
I love it.

31:28.587 --> 31:29.921
Oh, we made it happen.

31:30.021 --> 31:31.256
We made it happen.
Yeah, yeah.

31:31.356 --> 31:32.691
Congratulations
on everything.
Thank you. Thank you.

31:32.791 --> 31:34.126
Yeah, congrats
on all the success.

31:34.226 --> 31:35.360
Congrats, Rosa.

31:36.595 --> 31:39.531
Yay! So glad.

31:39.631 --> 31:43.802
This is validation for
my product and for my company.

31:43.902 --> 31:47.739
I worked really hard to get
wildwonder to where it is today.

31:47.839 --> 31:50.008
We've gone through
a lot of challenges,

31:50.108 --> 31:53.979
and it's clear that Tony
really appreciates that

31:54.079 --> 31:56.782
and he believes in me
and he believes in the company.

31:56.882 --> 31:59.117
So we're gonna take it
to the next level.

32:08.727 --> 32:10.796
Let's do it, buddy.
Let's go, man.

32:10.896 --> 32:13.932
Next up is
a company hoping to make a dent

32:14.032 --> 32:16.701
in the growing
plastic-waste problem.

32:24.743 --> 32:26.545
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Achal.

32:26.645 --> 32:29.114
And I'm Russ.
And we're Cabinet Health,

32:29.214 --> 32:31.283
the sustainable
healthcare company.

32:31.383 --> 32:35.720
Did you know that the medicine
industry produces 190 billion

32:35.821 --> 32:39.524
single-use plastic medicine
bottles every single year?

32:39.624 --> 32:42.427
That's enough to make a line
from here in Los Angeles

32:42.527 --> 32:43.995
to Australia... Mm.

32:44.095 --> 32:46.932
...325 times!

32:47.032 --> 32:51.736
And of all of those bottles,
only 3% to 7% are recycled.

32:51.837 --> 32:53.572
The rest
end up in our oceans,

32:53.672 --> 32:56.341
our landfills,
and eventually our bodies.

32:56.441 --> 33:00.111
Sharks, in my hand
is the amount of microplastics

33:00.212 --> 33:04.149
that you unknowingly ingest
every single year.

33:04.249 --> 33:07.619
Whoa.
That's 260 grams
of microplastics,

33:07.719 --> 33:10.555
which is like consuming
a credit card

33:10.655 --> 33:12.958
every single week!
Wow.

33:13.058 --> 33:16.027
Cabinet Health is a
sustainable healthcare company

33:16.127 --> 33:17.863
that's invented
the world's first

33:17.963 --> 33:20.131
compostable
and refillable system.

33:20.232 --> 33:22.167
Today,
we sell and manufacture

33:22.267 --> 33:25.570
high-quality over-the-counter
medicines and supplements.

33:25.670 --> 33:29.007
And we're on a mission
to eliminate single-use
plastic

33:29.107 --> 33:30.842
one cabinet at a time.

33:30.942 --> 33:33.612
We're positioned to change
this industry entirely.

33:33.712 --> 33:37.182
And we're here today to ask
for a $500,000 investment

33:37.282 --> 33:39.084
for a 2.5% stake
in Cabinet.

33:39.184 --> 33:40.085
Wow.

33:40.185 --> 33:41.720
So, Sharks...

33:41.820 --> 33:44.756
Are you ready to un-plastic
the healthcare industry?

33:44.856 --> 33:48.827
Sharks, in front of you
is a sample of our products.

33:48.927 --> 33:51.930
It starts with
our refillable, stackable

33:52.030 --> 33:54.966
and super space-efficient
bottles.

33:55.066 --> 33:58.803
Also, right next to that is
our compostable refillable pouches

33:58.904 --> 34:00.939
that meet FDA standards.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.941
And while they might
look like plastic,

34:03.041 --> 34:05.877
are made out of backyard
compostable materials.

34:05.977 --> 34:08.413
So I see you opening them.
It's a child-resistant cap.

34:08.513 --> 34:11.316
And then you hear that...
satisfying snap.

34:11.416 --> 34:12.884
That's the closure system.

34:13.018 --> 34:16.555
Cabinet promises customers
that we'll provide our products

34:16.655 --> 34:19.391
less than the brand price
with more pills.

34:19.491 --> 34:21.560
And customers
continually save

34:21.660 --> 34:24.162
by staying sustainable
using our plastic-free
refills.

34:24.262 --> 34:26.765
So they save about
20% to 30% on pricing.

34:26.865 --> 34:29.768
So the refills come in
these packages, these packs?

34:29.868 --> 34:31.303
Is this the idea?
Absolutely.

34:31.403 --> 34:33.438
So the way that
our product system works

34:33.538 --> 34:35.040
is when you buy
a starter set,

34:35.140 --> 34:36.908
to customers,
that's around $10 to $20,

34:37.008 --> 34:38.677
that glass bottle
that you have in front of you

34:38.777 --> 34:40.512
is a forever bottle.

34:40.612 --> 34:42.347
When you purchase it,
you get that once,

34:42.447 --> 34:44.382
we make a 60% to 80%
product margin on it.

34:44.482 --> 34:46.685
So,
you're selling a commodity.

34:46.785 --> 34:49.988
You're appealing to me because
I care about sustainability.

34:50.088 --> 34:51.189
Is that the story?

34:51.289 --> 34:53.191
That's a really important
part of it.

34:53.291 --> 34:56.161
Kevin, we actually have
700,000 customers to date.

34:56.261 --> 34:57.796
Wow.
700,000?

34:57.896 --> 34:59.230
And the reason that they buy
from us is,

34:59.331 --> 35:01.733
number one,
we have a better value

35:01.833 --> 35:04.536
and customers can save
sustainably on refills.

35:04.636 --> 35:07.706
So the first refill becomes
where the savings start

35:07.806 --> 35:09.741
because you're not--
This is an expensive package.

35:09.841 --> 35:10.976
Kevin, it's even better.

35:11.076 --> 35:13.511
So our products are priced
less than the brand name.

35:13.612 --> 35:14.746
The reason we can do that,

35:14.846 --> 35:17.415
I'll let Achal share about
our supply chain advantage.

35:17.515 --> 35:19.417
But customers save
on the first purchase.

35:19.517 --> 35:22.120
So I'm happy to share
how we got started, as well.

35:22.220 --> 35:24.055
I think that'll start to
answer some of your questions here.

35:24.155 --> 35:26.658
Yes. Tell us about you
and your story.

35:26.758 --> 35:29.094
I'm a third generation
healthcare entrepreneur.

35:29.194 --> 35:30.595
My grandfather built
one of world's first

35:30.695 --> 35:33.064
acetaminophen factories
60 years ago.

35:33.164 --> 35:34.099
- Wow.
- Wow.

35:34.199 --> 35:35.300
So when most kids
were at summer camp,

35:35.400 --> 35:37.268
I was literally in
a medicine factory

35:37.369 --> 35:38.937
learning the ins and outs
of this world.

35:39.037 --> 35:41.673
And as weird as it sounds,
I loved it.

35:41.773 --> 35:43.441
Along the way,
I started my professional career

35:43.541 --> 35:47.045
in healthcare strategy
and supply chain consulting.

35:47.145 --> 35:49.948
And, quite frankly, I was born
to build this business.

35:50.048 --> 35:53.184
And while I have a deep
personal background in healthcare,

35:53.284 --> 35:55.220
my good friend Russ'
background in sustainability

35:55.320 --> 35:57.489
is really what makes
our partnership special.

35:57.589 --> 36:00.458
My personal background is I'm
a sustainable product specialist

36:00.558 --> 36:03.328
and a U. S. Army officer in the
Connecticut Army National Guard.

36:03.428 --> 36:06.464
And I-I started my career in
state and federal legislatures

36:06.564 --> 36:08.299
building
environmental policies.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.135
From there, I moved over
to the private sector,

36:10.235 --> 36:11.569
where I worked at
Deloitte Consulting,

36:11.670 --> 36:14.873
that's where I met Ach,
and I led and started a program

36:14.973 --> 36:17.042
that helps scale
social businesses.

36:17.142 --> 36:21.012
It would be an appropriate
time at this point to say
$500,000

36:21.112 --> 36:25.316
for 2.5% imputes
a $20 million valuation.

36:25.417 --> 36:28.319
So I've been waiting
quietly in the weeds

36:28.420 --> 36:29.988
to hear about--
What are the sales?

36:30.088 --> 36:31.489
Happy to share.
Happy to share. Absolutely.

36:31.589 --> 36:33.992
So to answer that directly,
we'll do $14 million

36:34.092 --> 36:35.293
in sales this year.
There we go.

36:35.393 --> 36:36.528
What?!
$16 million run.

36:36.628 --> 36:37.529
I didn't expect that.

36:37.629 --> 36:39.130
How much you making on that?

36:39.230 --> 36:41.433
Right now, we're profitable
on a unit basis.

36:41.533 --> 36:43.935
We're investing heavily
in research and development

36:44.035 --> 36:46.337
to be able to bring additional
sustainable products to market.

36:46.438 --> 36:47.872
When I hear $14 million
in sales,

36:47.972 --> 36:51.109
what I really want to
know is how much cash
flow is it spinning off?

36:51.209 --> 36:53.278
Got it. So if I understand
that question correctly--

36:53.378 --> 36:54.279
It's very simple.

36:54.379 --> 36:55.980
Cash flow is cash flow. Yeah.

36:56.081 --> 36:58.016
This year we'll do $8 million
in inbound cash receipts.

36:58.116 --> 37:00.118
Is that your net profit
is $8 million

37:00.218 --> 37:01.753
that you're taking home?
It is not.

37:01.853 --> 37:04.255
So net profit this year
will be negative 20%.

37:04.355 --> 37:06.424
We'll be break even
Q3 of next year.

37:06.524 --> 37:08.460
Now, why negative 20%?

37:08.560 --> 37:09.761
What's the problem?
Great question.

37:09.861 --> 37:11.996
So we're investing
about $2.5 million this year

37:12.097 --> 37:13.298
into research
and development.

37:13.398 --> 37:15.300
No way. Okay, I gotta call
a little bit of BS there.

37:15.400 --> 37:16.568
What?
Okay.

37:16.668 --> 37:18.603
You've got your
sustainable packaging.
Mm-hmm.

37:18.703 --> 37:21.206
You're using
OEM medications.

37:21.306 --> 37:22.774
You're not inventing
any medications

37:22.874 --> 37:25.009
that are gonna
go through FDA approval.

37:25.110 --> 37:26.478
The products do have to
go through... Right.

37:26.578 --> 37:29.180
...rigorous stability testing
by drug molecule...

37:29.280 --> 37:31.216
Every single drug.
...because we're completely
changing the packaging.

37:31.316 --> 37:33.485
So every single medicine--
That's where your research
and development money

37:33.585 --> 37:34.819
is going right now?
Yes, correct.

37:34.919 --> 37:35.987
We need to invest heavily

37:36.087 --> 37:38.590
that the packaging
that we've made is safe.

37:38.690 --> 37:41.292
You have to get FDA approval
for different packaging?

37:41.392 --> 37:42.894
Absolutely.
Every time you release this?

37:42.994 --> 37:46.631
Every single pill count
and every single packaging.

37:46.731 --> 37:48.399
Let me save you
a little time. Yeah.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.068
It feels to me
like the kind of business

37:50.168 --> 37:52.637
that I'd wait forever
to get my money out.

37:52.737 --> 37:54.172
There's too much risk
in this.

37:54.272 --> 37:56.407
There's always something else
to spend money on.

37:56.508 --> 37:58.176
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

37:59.844 --> 38:01.813
The next 12 months,
what do you project

38:01.913 --> 38:03.448
your revenues
and your profits to be?

38:03.548 --> 38:06.451
Yeah, next 12 months we're
projecting around $25 million.

38:06.551 --> 38:08.853
We'll do about
a negative 10% net income

38:08.953 --> 38:11.756
and then we'll have a break
even point of October 2023.

38:11.856 --> 38:14.425
Can you tell us about
the fundraising history?

38:14.526 --> 38:16.895
Absolutely.
So we've raised $13 million...

38:16.995 --> 38:18.863
Oh!
...from mission-focused
investors

38:18.963 --> 38:21.833
that believe in eliminating
single-use plastic for medicine.

38:21.933 --> 38:23.468
What was
the latest valuation?

38:23.568 --> 38:25.436
$81 million post-money.

38:25.537 --> 38:26.938
So we're here
offering you a deal... Wow.

38:27.038 --> 38:28.506
...that's four times
better than that,

38:28.606 --> 38:30.108
because we believe
in the valuation.
O'Leary: $81 million?

38:30.208 --> 38:31.776
Guys, look,
I-I'll clear the deck.

38:31.876 --> 38:35.046
I appreciate what you're
trying to do on sustainability,

38:35.146 --> 38:38.049
but a lot of what you're doing
does not add up to me.

38:38.149 --> 38:40.185
It's just not a fit
for me.

38:40.285 --> 38:42.821
I appreciate what you're
doing, but for those reasons,
I'm out.

38:44.322 --> 38:45.356
O'Leary:
Um, I'm in this space,

38:45.456 --> 38:47.125
and I believe in the power
of sustainability

38:47.225 --> 38:48.426
being a motivator
for consumers.

38:48.526 --> 38:50.061
I've seen it happen
with Blueland,

38:50.161 --> 38:53.698
but I can't do this deal at
your valuation-- it's insane.

38:53.798 --> 38:55.633
Even now that you say
it's a discount from

38:55.733 --> 38:58.903
when you did it at $81
million, if that was the number.

38:59.003 --> 39:02.006
I'll give you the $500,000.
I want 12.5%.

39:02.106 --> 39:05.543
Kevin, first of all,
really appreciate the offer.
Yeah, thank you so much.

39:05.643 --> 39:07.111
Let me get to the punch line
for you, guys.

39:07.212 --> 39:09.147
I-I think the packaging
is great.

39:09.247 --> 39:10.582
You're playing in a space

39:10.682 --> 39:13.318
with highly recurring
business activity.

39:13.418 --> 39:16.354
I'm a big believer
in sustainability in general.

39:16.454 --> 39:18.523
That said, here's my offer.

39:32.003 --> 39:33.504
Two Sharks are out.

39:33.605 --> 39:36.207
Russ and Achal have an offer
on the table from Kevin

39:36.307 --> 39:39.644
for their sustainable medicine
company Cabinet Health,

39:39.744 --> 39:41.679
but Tony is also interested.

39:41.779 --> 39:43.081
Here's my offer.

39:43.181 --> 39:45.783
I'll do $500,000,

39:45.884 --> 39:47.552
and I'll do it at 10%.

39:48.620 --> 39:49.921
Yeah.

39:50.021 --> 39:51.623
I think where you're really
gonna need help

39:51.723 --> 39:53.992
is in the operational
excellence of scaling up.

39:54.092 --> 39:55.860
And that's really what,
you know,

39:55.960 --> 39:57.795
the business at DoorDash,
we're all about.

39:57.896 --> 39:59.330
Yeah.
And in terms of
what I've done,

39:59.430 --> 40:01.933
you know, in terms of my
entire entrepreneurial career

40:02.033 --> 40:05.236
is figuring out
every single way

40:05.336 --> 40:07.572
to actually optimize
that process.

40:07.672 --> 40:10.942
So that's what I actually
think, you know, we can do together.

40:11.042 --> 40:12.443
And I think it'd be
a huge business.

40:12.543 --> 40:14.112
We think that your investment
and your investment,

40:14.212 --> 40:16.014
Mr. Wonderful,
could be worth a lot more

40:16.114 --> 40:17.315
if we partnered together

40:17.415 --> 40:19.317
and so wanted to get
a sense if you'd being open

40:19.417 --> 40:20.618
to doing a deal together

40:20.718 --> 40:22.987
or, Lori, if you'd want
to come in on that.

40:23.087 --> 40:25.456
I think what you've done
is really brilliant.

40:25.556 --> 40:28.826
You can get rid of
so many plastic bottles.

40:28.927 --> 40:30.762
You did a beautiful job of it.

40:30.862 --> 40:32.630
So I really,
really like that.

40:32.730 --> 40:36.701
But I think the valuation
is... out of this world.

40:36.801 --> 40:38.002
Um, I hate it.

40:38.102 --> 40:40.438
So I wish you guys
both good luck.

40:40.538 --> 40:42.206
I'm sorry. I'm out.

40:44.242 --> 40:46.210
Guys, it's time
to make a decision, guys.

40:46.311 --> 40:47.745
You can counter,
say yes, say no.

40:47.845 --> 40:49.580
It's up to you.

40:49.681 --> 40:51.616
Tony and Kevin, we'd be
curious if you'd be open

40:51.716 --> 40:53.284
to a creative deal structure

40:53.384 --> 40:54.919
where we can give you
an opportunity

40:55.019 --> 40:56.988
to earn that
equity investment back

40:57.088 --> 40:58.423
and you guys
come in together.

40:58.523 --> 41:00.191
Go ahead and make your
counter. Let's see what they say.

41:00.291 --> 41:03.261
How about a deal
where you do 3.5% each

41:03.361 --> 41:06.264
in terms of equity,
but we give you a royalty

41:06.364 --> 41:08.266
where you actually earn
your initial investment back.

41:08.366 --> 41:10.601
What's the royalty
on each unit sale?

41:10.702 --> 41:12.971
We can do up to 2%
of top line revenue

41:13.071 --> 41:14.572
until you have that
initial investment repaid.

41:14.672 --> 41:15.707
I'll tell you
what we would do,

41:15.807 --> 41:17.108
and I'm speaking
on Tony's behalf,

41:17.208 --> 41:20.044
if you let us
double our money, okay,

41:20.144 --> 41:21.846
and this is not being
a savage at all.

41:21.946 --> 41:24.549
So 500K each,
then the royalty stops.

41:24.649 --> 41:26.584
Does that work for you, Tony?
I think it works.

41:26.684 --> 41:28.486
Although the equity
feels light.

41:28.586 --> 41:30.221
It is light,
except now you've got 2%.

41:30.321 --> 41:31.422
But you put the 2X--

41:31.522 --> 41:33.424
You put the 2X
return threshold. Exactly.

41:33.524 --> 41:35.126
Yeah.
I can get behind that.

41:35.226 --> 41:37.662
You got a deal.
That's the lowest I go.

41:40.431 --> 41:41.699
Works for me.
Works for you?

41:41.799 --> 41:42.900
Let's do it.
All right.

41:42.900 --> 41:44.502
You guys got a deal.
Done!

41:44.602 --> 41:45.703
Deal!

41:45.803 --> 41:48.106
I'm gonna DoorDash up
to you guys right now.

41:48.206 --> 41:50.341
It's so nice to meet you.
Mr. Wonderful.

41:50.441 --> 41:51.342
Pleasure to meet you.
Thank you. You too.

41:51.442 --> 41:53.211
Congrats, guys. Congrats.

41:53.311 --> 41:54.612
We'll blow it up for you,
that's for sure.

41:54.712 --> 41:55.913
Congrats, guys.

41:56.014 --> 41:57.448
Thank you all. Take care.
Thank you very much.

41:57.548 --> 41:58.616
Congrats.
O'Leary: Love it.

41:58.716 --> 42:00.852
You know, every time
I get a royalty,

42:00.952 --> 42:03.354
I feel warm and fuzzy.

42:03.454 --> 42:06.290
Sometimes you are
actually wonderful.

42:06.391 --> 42:08.626
Never. Never.

42:08.726 --> 42:09.927
With Kevin and Tony
on board,

42:10.028 --> 42:11.629
we can bring
sustainable packaging

42:11.729 --> 42:13.164
to so many more
medicine cabinets

42:13.264 --> 42:14.532
and learn from the best.

42:14.632 --> 42:16.134
We took
a slight valuation hit,

42:16.234 --> 42:18.036
but what's really important
is we're on a mission

42:18.136 --> 42:20.104
to eliminate single-use
plastics from medicine.

42:20.204 --> 42:22.073
To have two Sharks
on our side,

42:22.173 --> 42:24.409
to be able to do that,
is exactly what we need

42:24.509 --> 42:25.710
to be able
to solve the problem.
