02:24.336 --> 02:25.872
Good morning Sydney.

02:25.905 --> 02:27.807
It's 15 past the hour
with Gary Butterview

02:27.840 --> 02:29.008
for your morning drive time.

02:29.041 --> 02:31.443
We've got all the best local
music for your morning commute.

02:31.476 --> 02:33.378
We got some traffic news now.

02:33.411 --> 02:36.348
Delays on the Harbor
Bridge: nothing new there.

02:36.381 --> 02:38.851
But all other city approaches
are clear, imagine that.

02:38.885 --> 02:41.020
Trains, buses and ferries,
you won't believe it,

02:41.053 --> 02:42.855
they are running on time.

02:42.889 --> 02:44.556
Weather-wise, Sydney right now,

02:44.589 --> 02:46.092
a beautiful glorious spring day.

02:46.125 --> 02:49.996
A sunny 23 degrees in the most
beautiful city in the world.

02:50.029 --> 02:53.099
But now here it is, the new
track from Aussie band Loretta,

02:53.132 --> 02:54.634
sit back, relax and enjoy.

02:54.667 --> 02:57.402
This is Rock FM 91.5.

03:26.464 --> 03:27.365
Hi, Adam?

03:28.067 --> 03:29.501
I'm Adam.

03:29.534 --> 03:30.736
- Mrs. Barring?
- Yes.

03:30.770 --> 03:31.971
I'm just here to
fix your toilet.

03:32.004 --> 03:33.572
- Come on through.
- Through here?

03:42.447 --> 03:43.481
Alrighty.

04:09.008 --> 04:11.110
Well, found your problem.

04:13.646 --> 04:14.479
Tap was turned off.

04:15.815 --> 04:16.882
Oh, how embarrassing.

04:18.084 --> 04:20.086
It's all right, it happens.

04:20.119 --> 04:22.587
Sorry, I didn't know,
I just moved in here.

04:23.555 --> 04:25.624
You haven't got any
other shower heads or taps,

04:25.658 --> 04:26.959
toilets you want me to
look at while I'm here?

04:26.993 --> 04:28.694
No, everything
works just fine.

04:31.097 --> 04:33.498
Did you want a
drink or something?

04:33.531 --> 04:35.134
Well, that would
be lovely, thanks.

04:35.167 --> 04:36.202
Oh, actually, you haven't
got any soft drink

04:36.235 --> 04:37.637
by any chance, do you?

04:38.838 --> 04:39.739
Yeah, I do.

04:41.707 --> 04:42.507
Too easy.

05:38.563 --> 05:40.666
I have no soft
drink, only water.

05:40.700 --> 05:41.599
Oh, that's fine.

05:46.639 --> 05:48.140
Thank you.

05:48.174 --> 05:51.043
I normally carry some in
the van, but some days no.

05:53.779 --> 05:55.915
How long have you been out?

05:55.948 --> 05:57.116
I know you're an ex con.

05:58.150 --> 05:58.985
That's okay.

05:59.852 --> 06:01.087
I knew when I booked you.

06:03.289 --> 06:07.026
I didn't go to prison, so
technically I'm not an ex con.

06:09.762 --> 06:11.764
I was in a rehabilitation
unit for...

06:12.665 --> 06:14.566
You know what, I really
need to get going.

06:14.599 --> 06:15.167
I've got more job.

06:15.201 --> 06:16.035
So how about I...

06:22.074 --> 06:25.144
You went to rehab for six
months for molesting children.

06:26.178 --> 06:27.880
I was sick, I got help.

06:29.181 --> 06:31.884
I have a new business
now, I'm a changed man.

06:33.819 --> 06:35.121
So not even kiddie porn?

06:35.154 --> 06:35.988
No, no.

06:38.090 --> 06:38.891
No.

06:38.924 --> 06:39.759
No.

06:41.827 --> 06:44.030
How many were there,
the little boys?

06:45.597 --> 06:47.599
Eight, nine.

06:47.633 --> 06:49.201
I don't know.

06:49.235 --> 06:50.069
Eight?

06:51.871 --> 06:54.273
And they sent you to a
clinic to get some meds

06:54.306 --> 06:56.574
and talk to a doctor
about your feelings?

06:58.778 --> 06:59.577
Now you're out.

07:00.679 --> 07:03.115
New start, shiny new business.

07:04.650 --> 07:08.254
Access to family's homes
and their children.

07:11.323 --> 07:12.691
Take off your clothes.

07:14.727 --> 07:15.560
Why?

07:19.165 --> 07:20.266
Okay, okay.

07:34.113 --> 07:35.580
Drop your pants.

07:42.154 --> 07:43.022
Get on all fours.

07:45.191 --> 07:46.792
What are you gonna do?

07:51.864 --> 07:53.833
Please don't, don't hurt me.

07:54.834 --> 07:56.601
Please don't hurt me.

07:57.970 --> 07:59.972
I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.

08:01.173 --> 08:03.342
I'll do anything,
I'll do anything.

08:03.375 --> 08:05.945
I promise I'll get
into the clinic.

08:05.978 --> 08:06.879
I promise.

08:06.912 --> 08:08.180
I promise I'll do anything.

08:13.085 --> 08:15.788
It was nine boys by the way.

08:19.925 --> 08:20.893
Christopher.

08:20.926 --> 08:22.661
Sebastian.

11:58.177 --> 12:00.212
This is my life.

12:02.414 --> 12:06.118
I just wonder if
every day is gonna be

12:06.151 --> 12:08.153
like this for the
rest of my life.

12:16.962 --> 12:19.898
Did you know that when
I do exercise now,

12:19.932 --> 12:23.636
when I do pushups, if I'm
exerting a lot of energy

12:23.670 --> 12:25.104
I start having an orgasm.

12:26.271 --> 12:27.674
Some might think
that that makes me

12:27.707 --> 12:31.210
wanna do more exercise, but
I get fucking exhausted.

12:36.982 --> 12:38.617
You know, I've always
thought of studying.

12:41.453 --> 12:43.188
Dunno if it's worth it.

12:43.222 --> 12:45.624
I could probably do
psychology actually.

12:45.658 --> 12:49.161
You know, they say most
psychologists are nuts anyway.

12:52.498 --> 12:54.166
Probably fit right in.

12:57.403 --> 12:58.437
Well.

12:59.204 --> 13:01.708
That's our session
done for today.

13:01.741 --> 13:03.108
That felt like a bit,

13:03.142 --> 13:05.411
I think we're like
another half hour yet.

13:05.444 --> 13:08.113
If and when you're ready,
we can continue next week.

13:10.482 --> 13:13.051
Just make the
appointment with Helen.

13:13.085 --> 13:14.319
You know, it wasn't
very much to ask

13:14.353 --> 13:15.655
but they couldn't
handle the job.

13:17.022 --> 13:18.357
It sounds a bit silly
but I compare myself

13:18.390 --> 13:20.559
to Queen Elizabeth, you know?

13:20.592 --> 13:23.195
The reigning monarch,
all those prime ministers

13:23.228 --> 13:24.664
who came and went so quickly.

13:24.697 --> 13:25.597
Really?

13:25.632 --> 13:27.099
They couldn't handle the job.

13:27.132 --> 13:29.168
But still, she remained.

13:29.201 --> 13:31.503
Oh, Jessie, did you
get yourself some cake?

13:32.639 --> 13:33.706
There's cake out the back.

13:33.740 --> 13:35.541
Dr. Hamilton's birthday today.

13:35.574 --> 13:38.110
I mentioned it a few
times throughout the week.

13:39.611 --> 13:41.613
I'm always the one buying
cake for birthdays,

13:41.648 --> 13:44.349
I can't help it,
it's in my blood.

16:30.783 --> 16:32.785
Hey, Swan.

16:32.819 --> 16:34.887
We're heading off down
the pub, you coming?

16:34.921 --> 16:36.823
Thanks, I'm gonna stay
here a little longer.

16:36.856 --> 16:37.890
Oh, come on.

16:37.924 --> 16:39.792
Give the books a
rest, all right?

16:39.826 --> 16:40.827
Take some time off.

16:41.828 --> 16:44.229
This is doing my head in.

16:44.262 --> 16:45.765
It just doesn't make any sense.

16:45.798 --> 16:47.165
These pedophiles,
they get released

16:47.199 --> 16:49.802
and then within
months they vanish.

16:50.903 --> 16:51.738
This again.

16:53.706 --> 16:56.341
Look, Swan, you're
investing way too much

16:56.375 --> 16:58.645
time in these
scumbags, all right?

16:58.678 --> 16:59.812
The department doesn't
have the resources

16:59.846 --> 17:02.749
to follow them around 24 hours
a day, seven days a week.

17:02.782 --> 17:04.751
We'd love to, but we can't.

17:04.784 --> 17:06.752
So what are we
supposed to do, huh?

17:08.319 --> 17:09.821
Come on.

17:09.856 --> 17:12.659
Top button's undone,
ties loosened.

17:12.692 --> 17:14.694
One drink, first
round's on me, come on.

17:17.396 --> 17:18.163
Okay.

17:19.898 --> 17:22.166
One drink and then
I'm going home.

17:24.904 --> 17:25.905
One drink.

19:55.788 --> 19:56.621
Hi, Charlie.

19:57.890 --> 19:59.424
Hey.

19:59.457 --> 20:00.325
Dinner.

20:02.460 --> 20:04.697
No, no, I won't
forget, I'll be there.

20:04.730 --> 20:06.132
I'm at work, I gotta go.

20:06.165 --> 20:07.399
All right, bye.

22:04.582 --> 22:07.585
Grace O'Connell was a victim

22:07.619 --> 22:10.756
of domestic violence
who's manipulated

22:10.790 --> 22:14.927
into carrying out certain
acts in order to survive.

22:14.961 --> 22:19.865
She is not a bad person and
she is not a danger to society.

22:21.033 --> 22:23.669
We believe that victims
of domestic violence

22:23.703 --> 22:27.640
deserve the chance
to start a new life.

22:27.673 --> 22:31.243
And we have every faith that
Grace will do just that.

22:31.277 --> 22:32.577
Thank you.

23:24.697 --> 23:26.332
Oh my God, I
forgot to tell you.

23:26.365 --> 23:28.634
We got a new patient in.

23:28.667 --> 23:30.069
Mr. Reynolds.

23:30.102 --> 23:31.303
Mister?

23:31.337 --> 23:33.072
- Mr. Reynolds?
- Yeah.

23:33.105 --> 23:34.040
Our Vice Principal,

23:34.073 --> 23:35.741
- Mr. Reynolds?
- Yup.

23:35.775 --> 23:37.176
What's he doing there?

23:37.209 --> 23:38.844
Needs aged care.

23:38.878 --> 23:42.181
- Aw, wait, how old is he?
- 87.

23:42.214 --> 23:43.615
What?

23:43.649 --> 23:45.251
He was 87 when we
were at school.

23:45.284 --> 23:47.286
I know, his nose hair
now is out of control.

23:47.319 --> 23:48.387
Charlie.

23:48.421 --> 23:52.091
First thing I have to do,
go in, give him an enema.

23:52.124 --> 23:53.759
- No, no.
- Yeah.

23:53.793 --> 23:55.094
Yes.

23:55.127 --> 23:57.663
Mr. Reynolds who I haven't
seen since I was a kid,

23:57.696 --> 23:59.865
I've gotta go in and
give him an enema.

23:59.899 --> 24:01.167
Does he recognize you?

24:01.200 --> 24:02.368
No, thank God.

24:02.401 --> 24:04.270
Poor Mr. Reynolds.

24:04.303 --> 24:05.638
- Poor you.
- Thank you.

24:06.772 --> 24:08.674
Well, you're very
good with poop.

24:13.245 --> 24:16.248
Hey, what happened?

24:18.250 --> 24:19.785
I just love seeing you laugh.

24:21.954 --> 24:23.155
I love seeing you happy.

24:26.158 --> 24:28.861
You were always such a
happy kid even when...

24:36.135 --> 24:37.803
I wish I was there.

24:37.837 --> 24:39.839
You were a kid too.

24:39.872 --> 24:41.273
We were both kids.

24:42.274 --> 24:43.109
Hey.

24:48.347 --> 24:51.217
You were the best big
sister I could ask for.

24:53.886 --> 24:54.820
You make me laugh.

24:56.989 --> 24:58.891
I'm so proud of you,
did you know that?

24:58.924 --> 25:01.293
The work that you do,
Jess, it's so important

25:01.327 --> 25:02.895
and you do so much.

25:10.836 --> 25:12.304
I have to do more.

25:56.815 --> 25:58.250
Yeah, hi, it's me.

26:01.921 --> 26:04.023
Could you pass on my message?

26:07.126 --> 26:09.495
I don't have a contact number
yet for him to call me,

26:09.528 --> 26:11.997
so why didn't you
pass on the message?

26:14.900 --> 26:16.035
Thanks for nothing.

26:47.499 --> 26:49.468
- Hey, how you doing?
- Good.

26:49.501 --> 26:52.004
What would you like?

26:52.037 --> 26:54.373
- Long black, please.
- Sure.

27:09.355 --> 27:11.223
Excuse me, are those
chocolate muffins?

27:12.558 --> 27:13.559
What?

27:13.592 --> 27:15.461
Are those chocolate muffins?

27:15.494 --> 27:17.129
Yeah, three of them.

27:17.896 --> 27:19.531
I'm so sorry, I
know this is strange

27:19.565 --> 27:21.200
but they've actually
run out of them

27:21.233 --> 27:23.168
and I was wondering if I
could have one of yours.

27:23.202 --> 27:25.170
I'll pay you for it.

27:25.204 --> 27:26.305
Five dollars for a muffin?

27:39.852 --> 27:40.486
Thank you.

27:45.524 --> 27:47.459
Why not go somewhere
else and buy one?

27:47.493 --> 27:50.296
Oh, they make
it the best here.

27:52.064 --> 27:53.198
True.

27:53.232 --> 27:55.234
Mmm.

27:55.267 --> 27:59.138
Hmm.

27:59.171 --> 28:01.373
Mm.

28:05.244 --> 28:06.478
You're like Meg Ryan.

28:08.514 --> 28:09.348
Like what?

28:10.916 --> 28:13.585
From that movie where she's
getting off in the cafe.

28:13.619 --> 28:14.553
Oh.

28:18.991 --> 28:20.859
Don't ask me to
do the whole scene.

28:22.027 --> 28:23.562
Not while you're
sitting next to me.

28:25.464 --> 28:28.067
- How's your coffee?
- Pretty good.

28:28.100 --> 28:29.201
I've put like five
sugars in mine.

28:29.234 --> 28:30.069
Jessie.

28:34.206 --> 28:37.476
You haven't been answering
my calls or returning them.

28:37.509 --> 28:40.346
Kristina, I told you, I
can't see your son anymore.

28:40.379 --> 28:42.214
I don't take appointments
with children.

28:42.247 --> 28:43.949
You're the only
one he can talk to.

28:43.982 --> 28:46.051
It took him months to open up.

28:46.085 --> 28:48.420
And then you just
dumped him, Jessie.

28:49.388 --> 28:52.157
It's been years since
I saw Jack, Kristina.

28:52.191 --> 28:53.559
You need to find someone else.

28:53.592 --> 28:56.128
Someone else won't do.

28:58.364 --> 28:59.398
Please.

29:00.566 --> 29:02.134
They're not like you.

29:03.969 --> 29:04.671
We tried.

29:04.704 --> 29:06.105
He won't tell them anything.

29:06.138 --> 29:08.273
- Please, please, Jessie.
- I'm sorry, I can't.

29:08.307 --> 29:11.076
But just him, just him,
nobody else needs to know.

29:11.110 --> 29:14.246
If I see him, I'll have
to see the rest of them.

29:14.279 --> 29:16.115
But he needs you.

29:16.148 --> 29:19.318
He needs his mother,
not his psychologist.

29:19.351 --> 29:21.186
This mother isn't
enough, is she?

29:23.021 --> 29:23.889
Okay.

29:25.290 --> 29:28.260
I'm sorry, I can't
help you, okay?

29:29.228 --> 29:30.396
- Please leave me alone.
- Okay.

29:30.429 --> 29:32.331
Look, look, I can pay you.

29:33.465 --> 29:34.533
I can pay you, I'll
get another job

29:34.566 --> 29:36.135
and I'll give you all the wages

29:36.168 --> 29:37.403
and it'll go straight to you.

29:37.436 --> 29:39.304
- Get...
- It can be...

29:40.339 --> 29:41.974
Get away from me.

29:49.581 --> 29:54.420
Dammit.

30:30.622 --> 30:32.024
Dammit, Grace.

31:01.220 --> 31:03.055
And now in local news.

31:03.088 --> 31:05.123
Following the discovery
that convicted

31:05.157 --> 31:07.559
child molester Kit
Richardson has moved

31:07.593 --> 31:09.729
into their local
suburb of Harlington,

31:09.762 --> 31:12.699
community groups are up in arms.

31:12.732 --> 31:16.368
Kit was tried and convicted
when he was 17 years old

31:16.401 --> 31:18.771
for molesting two
10-year-old boys.

31:18.805 --> 31:21.173
Now it was an
incredibly vicious crime

31:21.206 --> 31:22.574
so he was tried as an adult

31:22.608 --> 31:26.378
and subsequently served six
years of time in prison.

31:26.411 --> 31:27.714
Given the viciousness
of the crime,

31:27.747 --> 31:30.048
community groups believe
that he should be

31:30.082 --> 31:31.517
pushed out of the suburb.

31:31.550 --> 31:33.653
But Freedom For All
activists believe

31:33.686 --> 31:37.422
having served his time, he
deserves a second chance.

31:37.456 --> 31:39.626
Lucy Collins reports.

31:39.659 --> 31:41.527
I'm joined now by
Dan Leung who heads up

31:41.560 --> 31:42.629
the community group.

31:42.662 --> 31:44.296
Thanks so much for
joining me, Dan.

31:44.329 --> 31:45.497
Did you wanna start by
telling us about the group

31:45.531 --> 31:47.466
and what you hope to achieve?

31:47.499 --> 31:48.600
Thank you, Lucy.

31:48.635 --> 31:51.370
So the group was formed by
few of us concerned residents

31:51.403 --> 31:53.505
after we discovered that
this child molester,

31:53.539 --> 31:56.475
Kit Richardson, is living
in our neighborhood.

31:56.508 --> 31:59.378
Now the school is
just down the road

31:59.411 --> 32:02.147
and Richardson is only
a few streets away.

32:02.180 --> 32:04.651
So we are just appalled
that this monster

32:04.684 --> 32:06.618
is allowed to roam freely.

32:06.653 --> 32:08.353
I understand
your concerns, Dan.

32:08.387 --> 32:10.556
However, some of your
neighbors believe that

32:10.589 --> 32:13.660
he deserves a second chance
and that he's served his time.

32:13.693 --> 32:14.861
What are your thoughts on this?

32:14.894 --> 32:17.529
No, I don't believe
that for one second.

32:17.563 --> 32:19.431
Richardson is a dangerous man

32:19.464 --> 32:22.735
and he is a real threat
to the community.

32:22.769 --> 32:24.536
And we're not gonna
put up with it anymore.

32:24.570 --> 32:26.138
So we're gonna do
something about it.

32:26.171 --> 32:29.207
So if you'd like to attend,
we hold evening meetings

32:29.241 --> 32:30.743
at the Harlington
Community Center

32:30.777 --> 32:32.779
and we plan to
protest to the council

32:32.812 --> 32:34.714
or to anywhere else that
will hear our voice.

32:34.747 --> 32:37.750
And if we're not listened to,
we're gonna speak even louder.

32:39.518 --> 32:40.787
As you've heard here today,

32:40.820 --> 32:42.655
the residents of Harlington
are quite distraught

32:42.689 --> 32:44.791
that Kit Richardson
has moved into town.

32:44.824 --> 32:46.258
I'd love it if you could
make a comment, please,

32:46.291 --> 32:47.559
to the parents of Harlington.

32:47.593 --> 32:49.194
They'd like to know, are
their children safe...

32:51.496 --> 32:52.765
Move.

32:52.799 --> 32:54.667
Get off.

32:54.701 --> 32:55.768
Get that fucking
Camera out of my face.

32:55.802 --> 32:57.502
Just one comment.

32:57.536 --> 32:59.204
Jimmy, Jimmy!

32:59.237 --> 33:02.240
I'm Lucy Collins
from Channel 42 news.

33:02.274 --> 33:04.811
Now joining us from
our West Coast studio,

33:04.844 --> 33:07.814
Gerry O'Brien represents
the Freedom for All group

33:07.847 --> 33:10.616
regarding the controversy
around Kit Richardson

33:10.650 --> 33:12.785
moving into the
suburb of Harlington.

33:12.819 --> 33:14.754
Gerry, what are your thoughts?

33:14.787 --> 33:16.723
Look, as a group
we've always stated that

33:16.756 --> 33:19.291
we believe in people getting
a second chance at life

33:19.324 --> 33:23.161
and that with the right support,
they can be rehabilitated.

33:23.195 --> 33:25.932
He's someone who was 17 when
he committed that crime.

33:25.965 --> 33:27.499
He was still
considered a juvenile

33:27.532 --> 33:28.835
but he was tried as an adult.

33:28.868 --> 33:30.435
Gerry,
you have to admit though,

33:30.469 --> 33:33.405
it was an incredibly
vicious premeditated crime.

33:33.438 --> 33:36.676
We're not denying
that, but he was a child.

33:36.709 --> 33:39.578
Who knows that he was
pushed on by peer pressure

33:39.611 --> 33:41.914
or what kind of
upbringing this, you know,

33:41.948 --> 33:43.783
now young man has had.

33:43.816 --> 33:46.719
So how do you know he
can't be pressured again?

33:46.753 --> 33:49.722
Is that really a risk
we're willing to take?

33:49.756 --> 33:53.225
This is his chance to come
back and be rehabilitated

33:53.258 --> 33:55.762
and have the support
he needs to have

33:55.795 --> 33:56.729
a second chance at life.

33:56.763 --> 33:58.698
Thank you
for your time, Gerry.

33:58.731 --> 34:00.933
Now over to Peter
with the weather.

35:47.606 --> 35:49.041
Excuse me.

35:49.075 --> 35:51.010
- Hi there, I'm Dan.
- Nancy.

35:51.043 --> 35:52.078
Are you here for the meeting?

35:52.111 --> 35:53.345
Yeah.

35:54.446 --> 35:56.615
Good to see some
new faces to the team.

35:56.649 --> 35:58.751
Yeah, I'm new to the area.

35:58.785 --> 36:00.485
I have a three-year-old.

36:00.519 --> 36:01.854
Oh, I hear ya.

36:01.888 --> 36:02.989
My boys are five and four.

36:04.123 --> 36:06.959
I'm absolutely ropable that
this guy is in our neighborhood.

36:06.993 --> 36:10.096
Yeah, yeah, I'm scared.

36:10.129 --> 36:11.530
That's okay.

36:11.563 --> 36:13.465
We have a full force
here in this community

36:13.498 --> 36:15.400
and we won't be going
down without a fight.

36:15.433 --> 36:16.669
No.

36:16.702 --> 36:18.704
Well, grab yourself a
coffee and take a seat.

36:18.738 --> 36:20.572
Meeting's about to start.

36:20.605 --> 36:21.439
Okay.

36:22.541 --> 36:23.375
Shall we?

36:28.080 --> 36:30.683
We have not been listened to.

36:31.616 --> 36:33.119
No.

36:33.152 --> 36:35.955
Even though we have voiced
our concerns countless times

36:35.988 --> 36:37.690
at the council meetings.

36:37.723 --> 36:39.725
Yeah, right.

36:39.759 --> 36:42.061
And still not listened to.

36:42.094 --> 36:43.495
That's outrageous.

36:43.528 --> 36:47.133
So here we are, a
determined bloody bunch

36:47.166 --> 36:49.467
to get this sicko out
of our neighborhood.

36:50.870 --> 36:55.875
Kit Richardson was
imprisoned for only six years

36:56.909 --> 36:59.912
for taking those two little
boys out into the bush that day.

37:00.913 --> 37:02.982
We know what happened.

37:03.015 --> 37:07.485
And now this sick piece of shit,

37:09.487 --> 37:12.357
excuse my language folks,
but that's what he is.

37:14.126 --> 37:17.129
He's in our neighborhood,
down the road,

37:17.163 --> 37:20.365
near the same school
that my boys go to.

37:21.433 --> 37:22.467
Yeah.

37:23.236 --> 37:27.405
Now, we have signs,
we have placards,

37:27.439 --> 37:30.475
and we have people power
and a clear message.

37:30.508 --> 37:34.479
And we will not give up until
this guy is out of here.

37:34.512 --> 37:36.414
- Yeah!
- That's right.

40:40.166 --> 40:41.000
Hey.

40:42.401 --> 40:44.870
My car is not working, would
you mind helping me out?

40:44.904 --> 40:46.705
Fuck off, you slut.

40:58.317 --> 40:59.118
Hey.

42:04.917 --> 42:05.918
Fuck!

42:06.986 --> 42:08.787
Fucking whore!

42:13.959 --> 42:15.161
Fuck you, fuck!

42:16.996 --> 42:18.430
You fucking whore.

42:18.464 --> 42:21.834
Get me out of here,
I'll fucking kill you.

42:31.911 --> 42:32.745
Yeah?

42:37.049 --> 42:37.883
Fuck!

42:41.220 --> 42:42.054
Fuck.

42:44.056 --> 42:44.890
Stop.

42:54.500 --> 42:58.404
It was their hair,
their soft skin.

43:00.472 --> 43:01.307
Their lips.

43:05.010 --> 43:06.111
They begged me for it.

45:36.295 --> 45:38.430
Morning, Jessie.

45:38.464 --> 45:39.298
Morning, Helen.

45:40.999 --> 45:43.535
Actually it's, oh,
yes, it is still morning.

45:43.569 --> 45:45.604
Good morning, Jessie.

45:45.638 --> 45:47.206
My mother was always telling me

45:47.239 --> 45:49.108
to get my greetings
accurate because a greeting

45:49.141 --> 45:51.678
is the first impression
you make on a person.

45:51.711 --> 45:54.279
Now, Jessie, I wanted to
check a few things with you

45:54.313 --> 45:56.115
before you start your day.

45:56.148 --> 45:57.916
We have four of the
psychologists here

45:57.950 --> 45:59.485
at the center doing
pro bono on Saturdays.

45:59.518 --> 46:01.286
Did you want me to
add you to the list?

46:01.320 --> 46:02.154
No.

46:03.222 --> 46:04.056
Really?

46:06.158 --> 46:07.292
Morning.

46:07.326 --> 46:08.527
Yeah, hi.

46:08.560 --> 46:11.163
I wanna know how much it
costs to see somebody.

46:11.196 --> 46:13.399
Well, the first
session is $200 dear,

46:13.432 --> 46:16.135
and do you have
private healthcare?

46:18.036 --> 46:19.438
Well, they do pro
bono on Saturday

46:19.471 --> 46:20.973
so you can come in
for a free session

46:21.006 --> 46:22.709
if you don't have
much money, dear.

46:22.742 --> 46:25.577
Yeah, I called, the chick at
the refuge center might help.

46:25.611 --> 46:26.612
Can indeed.

46:28.280 --> 46:30.482
Why don't you give me your
name and I'll book you in?

46:30.516 --> 46:31.450
Grace O'Connell.

46:33.352 --> 46:35.287
10 o'clock on Saturday.

46:35.320 --> 46:36.321
This Saturday.

46:38.323 --> 46:39.958
We'll see you then.

47:16.361 --> 47:18.363
- Mr. Leung?
- That's right.

47:18.397 --> 47:19.364
I'm Detective Swan.

47:19.398 --> 47:21.433
I'm sorry to call so late.

47:21.467 --> 47:24.369
I just like to ask you some
questions about Kit Richardson.

47:24.403 --> 47:26.138
Kit Richardson?

47:26.171 --> 47:26.972
What about him?

47:27.740 --> 47:30.075
He seems to have gone missing.

47:30.108 --> 47:32.679
Look, I'm not sure what
it is you're suggesting here

47:32.712 --> 47:34.513
but I didn't do anything to him.

47:34.546 --> 47:36.548
I'm not suggesting anything.

47:36.582 --> 47:38.283
You're on the
neighborhood watch group.

47:38.317 --> 47:39.686
You hold weekly
meetings and protests

47:39.719 --> 47:42.354
to have Mr. Richardson
removed from the area.

47:42.387 --> 47:44.389
Yes, that's right.

47:44.423 --> 47:47.326
The people that attend these
meetings, do you know them?

47:48.260 --> 47:49.094
Are they local?

47:50.162 --> 47:52.397
Yes, they're members
of my community.

47:52.431 --> 47:54.166
We go to the same
church and our kids

47:54.199 --> 47:55.601
go to school together.

47:55.635 --> 47:57.035
You don't feel as though
some of your members

47:57.069 --> 47:59.238
might ever get a little
bit carried away,

47:59.271 --> 48:01.139
approach Mr. Richardson
on their own?

48:02.107 --> 48:04.476
Look, we're all law
abiding citizens, okay?

48:04.510 --> 48:06.512
It's our right to protest.

48:08.648 --> 48:10.582
I've got two kids
ready for their baths.

48:10.616 --> 48:13.452
I'm sorry I can't be
of any further help.

48:13.485 --> 48:14.620
Thank you for your time.

48:14.654 --> 48:17.389
If you do think of
anything, here's my card.

48:17.422 --> 48:19.424
Please don't hesitate
to contact me.

48:19.458 --> 48:20.259
Sure.

48:23.395 --> 48:27.065
Hang on, there was this woman.

48:27.099 --> 48:28.400
A woman?

48:28.433 --> 48:29.368
Yeah.

48:31.603 --> 48:33.472
She was new.

48:33.505 --> 48:37.543
Dark hair, tall,
she wore glasses.

48:37.576 --> 48:40.780
She attended one meeting
but haven't seen her since.

48:40.813 --> 48:42.147
Did you get her name?

48:43.382 --> 48:44.684
Nancy, that's it.

48:44.717 --> 48:46.418
Her name was Nancy.

48:46.451 --> 48:47.419
Anything else?

48:49.521 --> 48:51.123
No.

48:51.156 --> 48:54.459
Well, if you think of anything
else, you've got my card.

48:54.493 --> 48:55.828
Thank you.

48:55.862 --> 48:56.696
No worries.

50:12.337 --> 50:14.807
Oh, shoot, I'm so sorry.

50:17.844 --> 50:19.679
I'm so sorry, please let
me buy you another meal.

50:19.712 --> 50:21.580
It's all good, I'm clumsy too.

50:22.514 --> 50:23.850
Hey, it's you.

50:23.883 --> 50:25.217
Yeah?

50:25.250 --> 50:27.687
You gave me a muffin,
chocolate muffin.

50:27.720 --> 50:29.187
I don't have
any other muffins.

50:29.221 --> 50:32.224
Yeah, I know but you
also don't have a meal.

50:32.257 --> 50:34.159
Let me buy you another
burger, please.

50:36.629 --> 50:37.462
I'm so sorry.

50:38.698 --> 50:39.832
Okay, sure.

50:39.866 --> 50:41.734
- Okay, good.
- Thanks.

50:47.840 --> 50:50.442
Do you always
have a late dinner?

50:50.475 --> 50:52.310
Mostly when I'm bored.

50:52.344 --> 50:53.913
I prefer it when it's quiet.

50:53.946 --> 50:55.915
People tend to
leave me alone then.

50:56.816 --> 50:58.183
Should I be going?

50:59.819 --> 51:01.688
No, no.

51:01.721 --> 51:03.455
People come up and talk to you

51:03.488 --> 51:05.758
without having knocked
over your dinner first.

51:11.463 --> 51:13.365
I'm sorry about that.

51:14.299 --> 51:15.600
So do you have a boyfriend?

51:17.770 --> 51:19.672
- No, you?
- No.

51:20.505 --> 51:21.741
I don't trust men.

51:22.842 --> 51:27.814
I've been cheated on a lot
and, you know, hit a few times.

51:30.950 --> 51:32.417
Oh, okay.

51:32.451 --> 51:34.319
Sorry, too much information?

51:36.521 --> 51:38.658
I just like to be an open book.

51:39.659 --> 51:41.694
- Do you know me?
- No.

51:44.396 --> 51:46.231
I guess I'm getting to know you.

51:47.166 --> 51:48.968
I was involved in something
a couple of years ago

51:49.001 --> 51:50.803
and it was on the news.

51:50.837 --> 51:52.471
Oh, is everything okay?

51:52.504 --> 51:54.606
Yeah, yeah, just
some shit with the ex.

51:55.808 --> 51:56.976
He used to beat me and...

51:57.009 --> 51:58.945
Oh God, I'm so sorry.

51:58.978 --> 52:01.346
No, no, it's cool,
it's cool, all good.

52:02.715 --> 52:05.417
He's in prison now, so I
haven't really made any friends

52:05.450 --> 52:06.618
or shit since, you know?

52:07.820 --> 52:10.857
When I'd get calls it was from
the journalists harassing me.

52:13.726 --> 52:15.560
Well, the good
news is I don't pry.

52:16.996 --> 52:19.866
And I believe in giving
people a second chance,

52:19.899 --> 52:20.733
a fresh start.

52:27.707 --> 52:29.441
- It's quiet.
- Yeah.

52:29.474 --> 52:30.777
They got pretty good food.

52:30.810 --> 52:33.311
Yeah, the burgers
are pretty nice, eh?

52:33.345 --> 52:35.347
Oh, that was good.

52:35.380 --> 52:36.548
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

52:37.516 --> 52:39.652
It's cold, I should head back.

52:39.685 --> 52:40.920
Oh, my car is just over there.

52:40.953 --> 52:42.855
I can give you a
lift if you like.

52:43.790 --> 52:45.958
No, I'll get the bus.

52:45.992 --> 52:48.293
Do you wanna grab
a drink or something?

52:49.662 --> 52:51.664
Are you a lesbian 'cause
I've got a boyfriend?

52:52.698 --> 52:54.000
A boyfriend?

52:54.033 --> 52:55.333
I thought he was your ex.

52:55.367 --> 52:57.036
Whatever, he's my boyfriend.

52:57.069 --> 52:58.037
He was then and he still is now

52:58.070 --> 53:00.039
just 'cause he's locked up.

53:00.072 --> 53:03.042
I know what you're
thinking, I'm weak.

53:03.075 --> 53:04.744
Stay with the guy
who beat me up.

53:05.410 --> 53:07.312
That's not what I'm thinking.

53:11.117 --> 53:12.852
You avoided jail time by playing

53:12.885 --> 53:14.452
the domestic violence victim.

53:15.655 --> 53:17.322
But you're still in
contact with him.

53:18.090 --> 53:19.591
You do know who I am.

53:20.827 --> 53:22.862
Long before we met, Grace.

54:04.036 --> 54:05.104
What are you doing?

54:13.511 --> 54:16.514
I remember that story you
told in your court case,

54:16.548 --> 54:17.750
about how you and your boyfriend

54:17.783 --> 54:19.517
kept those children
you kidnapped.

54:21.486 --> 54:22.520
Fed them stale bread.

54:25.624 --> 54:27.425
You'd take off little pieces.

54:28.861 --> 54:31.998
You'd tell the kids that
they could only eat it

54:32.031 --> 54:34.066
if they caught it
in their mouth.

54:35.768 --> 54:37.569
It's all a game to you.

54:39.071 --> 54:41.140
Some light hearted fun.

54:41.173 --> 54:42.407
Fuck off!

54:44.010 --> 54:45.443
I said fuck off!

54:53.085 --> 54:55.988
You were never punished.

54:56.022 --> 54:56.956
You should've been.

54:59.225 --> 55:01.193
You were sentenced to what?

55:01.227 --> 55:02.061
Five years?

55:06.265 --> 55:08.067
But you were granted a retrial.

55:08.100 --> 55:11.137
I was a victim myself.

55:11.170 --> 55:14.240
My boyfriend, he used to
beat me every single day

55:14.273 --> 55:16.742
until I had no choice.

55:16.776 --> 55:18.510
I remember your testimony.

55:19.979 --> 55:23.481
He beat you into submission,
made you fear for your life.

55:23.515 --> 55:24.817
So you did what he said.

55:28.620 --> 55:30.890
In your re-trial, the
judge took pity on you.

55:32.692 --> 55:34.459
Believed your sob story.

55:36.662 --> 55:38.097
I don't buy it.

55:42.534 --> 55:44.170
So, you will stay here

55:48.274 --> 55:49.742
and you will serve your time.

55:51.811 --> 55:54.647
Until I see fit to release you.

55:58.050 --> 55:59.517
However I may release you.

56:05.291 --> 56:06.058
Help!

56:06.092 --> 56:07.693
Help me!

56:07.727 --> 56:08.560
Help!

56:09.996 --> 56:12.231
You can call out for help,
by the way, I don't mind.

56:12.264 --> 56:14.767
Scream all you want, you're
in the middle of nowhere.

56:16.168 --> 56:20.505
Plus what did you do when
the children called for help?

56:22.708 --> 56:24.677
Put your cigarette
out on their skin?

58:26.699 --> 58:30.269
I don't take photos of my
victims the way you used to.

58:32.438 --> 58:34.373
But then again you
were in the business

58:34.406 --> 58:35.941
of selling children.

58:37.877 --> 58:40.346
So you needed it for
advertising, right?

58:43.482 --> 58:44.817
I draw pictures.

58:49.221 --> 58:52.158
It's not very good I know,
but you get the idea.

58:56.829 --> 59:00.032
The good news is your
day of punishment

59:00.065 --> 59:01.901
has not yet arrived.

59:03.235 --> 59:07.806
The bad news is you have
to sit in your filth

59:07.840 --> 59:08.874
for a bit longer.

59:14.213 --> 59:15.047
Why?

59:16.215 --> 59:18.417
Don't be so stupid
as to ask why.

59:20.286 --> 59:21.754
You know why.

01:00:20.879 --> 01:00:23.782
Hello, Mitchell.

01:00:23.816 --> 01:00:25.451
Little Mitchell Douglas.

01:00:25.484 --> 01:00:27.152
Look at you all grown up.

01:00:28.287 --> 01:00:30.022
Hey, Dr. Fuller.

01:00:30.055 --> 01:00:32.024
Jessie, you can call
me Jessie, remember?

01:00:34.026 --> 01:00:34.893
What a lovely surprise.

01:00:34.927 --> 01:00:36.996
How long has it been
since I last saw you?

01:00:38.530 --> 01:00:40.032
Five years?

01:00:42.167 --> 01:00:43.202
Five years?

01:00:43.235 --> 01:00:44.336
That's a long time.

01:00:46.171 --> 01:00:47.906
Yeah, well, you
stopped seeing kids.

01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:49.808
Yes, I did.

01:00:49.842 --> 01:00:51.443
And my math isn't
too good but I think

01:00:51.477 --> 01:00:53.279
that would make you 17?

01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:56.315
Still a little bit too
young at this point.

01:00:56.348 --> 01:00:57.983
You'd have to wait another year,

01:00:58.017 --> 01:00:59.585
but I can recommend a youth
counselor if you like.

01:00:59.618 --> 01:01:01.387
It's okay, Jessie,
I can take this.

01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:02.888
Can I help you, young man?

01:01:04.056 --> 01:01:06.392
I'm not here as a patient.

01:01:09.228 --> 01:01:11.230
We can go to my office
and have a chat if you like?

01:01:13.899 --> 01:01:14.500
Yes.

01:01:23.242 --> 01:01:25.844
Okay, come on in, take a seat.

01:01:25.878 --> 01:01:27.112
Tell me what's happening.

01:01:29.515 --> 01:01:31.383
Are you still doing
the gaming stuff?

01:01:33.352 --> 01:01:34.219
I lied.

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:36.221
About gaming?

01:01:37.956 --> 01:01:40.125
No, about what happened with...

01:01:40.926 --> 01:01:43.195
Was it War of the
Worlds or something?

01:01:44.096 --> 01:01:45.197
Geoffrey Callaghan.

01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:49.234
How's your little sister?

01:01:49.968 --> 01:01:51.537
I lied about
everything I said.

01:01:51.570 --> 01:01:53.405
What I told you never happened.

01:01:56.108 --> 01:01:57.242
Stop, Mitchell,
and think about

01:01:57.276 --> 01:01:59.144
the words that you're saying.

01:01:59.178 --> 01:02:01.180
Please, think carefully.

01:02:02.214 --> 01:02:06.185
But Dr. Fuller, he never
did those things, okay?

01:02:06.218 --> 01:02:07.286
I lied.

01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:11.056
He took my footy and he
wouldn't give it back

01:02:11.090 --> 01:02:12.524
and then I just wanted
him to, you know?

01:02:12.558 --> 01:02:14.159
And then he died.

01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:16.261
He was murdered.

01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:19.365
I knew it was my fault.

01:02:19.398 --> 01:02:20.566
I knew he was murdered
because of me.

01:02:22.935 --> 01:02:24.303
But you gave such
detailed accounts

01:02:24.336 --> 01:02:26.238
of what he did to you.

01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:31.143
I watch movies, okay?

01:02:31.176 --> 01:02:33.312
I lied, I made it all up.

01:02:33.345 --> 01:02:35.948
That's all, I lied,
that's all I do, okay?

01:02:35.981 --> 01:02:38.050
But I can't do it
anymore, I'm sick of it.

01:02:38.083 --> 01:02:39.151
This is it, this is the truth.

01:02:39.184 --> 01:02:41.086
This is what happened, what
I'm telling you right now,

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:42.388
- this is what happened.
- No.

01:02:44.189 --> 01:02:45.991
Mitchell, this is not the truth.

01:02:47.593 --> 01:02:51.363
This isn't the truth,
please, tell me this isn't.

01:02:51.397 --> 01:02:54.566
I'm only telling you
'cause you were there for me.

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:57.569
And you were patient
and you listened to me.

01:02:57.603 --> 01:02:59.037
Mitchell, hold on.

01:02:59.071 --> 01:03:01.240
No, look, this is
confidential, okay?

01:03:01.273 --> 01:03:03.475
So just don't tell
anyone, just let me do it.

01:05:38.297 --> 01:05:39.632
Who are you?

01:05:39.666 --> 01:05:40.599
I'm with the police.

01:05:44.336 --> 01:05:46.138
I heard there was a
disturbance in the area

01:05:46.171 --> 01:05:48.140
so I thought I'd come
and check on you.

01:05:49.074 --> 01:05:51.243
And by the way your
backdoor was left open.

01:05:53.713 --> 01:05:55.648
Well, can I see some ID?

01:05:56.749 --> 01:05:57.583
Sure.

01:06:00.252 --> 01:06:02.187
I can leave if you'd like.

01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:03.522
No, no, no, sorry.

01:06:03.555 --> 01:06:04.623
No, wait.

01:06:04.657 --> 01:06:05.658
Wait, please.

01:06:08.628 --> 01:06:12.564
My wife, Maggie, has had
to go and stay in a hotel

01:06:12.598 --> 01:06:14.667
things have got so bad.

01:06:16.301 --> 01:06:18.503
My daughter took her
there two days ago.

01:06:18.537 --> 01:06:23.208
It's just been me on
my own ever since.

01:06:25.344 --> 01:06:27.446
You know, I never
touched that boy.

01:06:28.681 --> 01:06:30.449
I don't care what the jury says.

01:06:31.751 --> 01:06:33.720
I did not lay a hand on him.

01:06:34.586 --> 01:06:35.822
But you were convicted.

01:06:38.725 --> 01:06:41.828
Every single member of
the jury found you guilty.

01:06:42.895 --> 01:06:45.665
Got off pretty
lightly if you ask me.

01:06:45.698 --> 01:06:47.700
I've been accused.

01:06:47.734 --> 01:06:51.303
I've been painted
as a child molester,

01:06:51.336 --> 01:06:53.305
accused of a crime
I did not commit.

01:06:55.775 --> 01:06:58.210
The most hideous
crime imaginable.

01:06:59.411 --> 01:07:01.346
Don't think that's
getting off easy.

01:07:02.514 --> 01:07:04.182
You get to wake
up in your own bed.

01:07:06.786 --> 01:07:10.288
You can watch TV,
eat what you like,

01:07:10.322 --> 01:07:12.157
go outside, do some gardening.

01:07:13.458 --> 01:07:15.260
I don't go out there.

01:07:15.293 --> 01:07:16.829
They throw rocks at me.

01:07:16.863 --> 01:07:19.899
They call me a...

01:07:24.671 --> 01:07:27.774
If you knew me, you would know

01:07:27.807 --> 01:07:29.408
that I could never hurt a child.

01:07:31.978 --> 01:07:34.847
I never even
smacked my own kids.

01:07:36.849 --> 01:07:37.850
I do know you.

01:07:39.284 --> 01:07:40.585
I know people like you.

01:07:46.324 --> 01:07:48.661
You can lie to
yourself, old man.

01:07:49.729 --> 01:07:51.731
But I don't believe you.

01:08:46.585 --> 01:08:48.988
May I please have some water?

01:08:55.327 --> 01:08:57.964
Your boyfriend put you in
a hospital several times.

01:09:00.564 --> 01:09:02.267
But you never pressed charges.

01:09:03.736 --> 01:09:05.370
I was really scared of him.

01:09:07.774 --> 01:09:09.975
What's the worst thing
he ever did to you?

01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:13.045
I've had a really tough life.

01:09:13.078 --> 01:09:14.981
Heaps of bad shit's
happened to me.

01:09:16.515 --> 01:09:18.751
What is the worst
thing he ever did to you?

01:09:20.417 --> 01:09:24.356
He held knives to my throat,
to different parts of my body

01:09:24.389 --> 01:09:26.424
threatened to cut
my breasts off.

01:09:26.457 --> 01:09:28.828
Said he'd cut me up in my sleep.

01:09:32.363 --> 01:09:33.966
So I should pity you, Grace?

01:09:35.835 --> 01:09:39.337
You should have some
empathy for me, yeah.

01:09:40.106 --> 01:09:41.339
I should.

01:09:44.376 --> 01:09:45.377
Can you let me go?

01:09:47.145 --> 01:09:48.479
I'm not a bad person.

01:09:48.513 --> 01:09:51.515
And maybe if you
talk, we talk enough,

01:09:51.550 --> 01:09:52.752
I tell you about my life,

01:09:52.785 --> 01:09:53.685
you'll see that I'm
not a bad person...

01:09:53.719 --> 01:09:55.121
Don't try to influence me.

01:09:55.154 --> 01:09:57.522
Just answer my questions
when I ask them

01:09:57.556 --> 01:09:59.025
and I'll figure out the rest.

01:10:08.835 --> 01:10:10.335
That drawing you did.

01:10:11.904 --> 01:10:13.706
When's that gonna happen to me?

01:10:19.645 --> 01:10:21.681
I don't know.

01:10:21.714 --> 01:10:25.051
I don't know what I'm
gonna do with you.

01:11:36.521 --> 01:11:37.522
Hello?

01:11:39.191 --> 01:11:40.760
Hello, Helen.

01:11:40.793 --> 01:11:41.994
Are you free to speak?

01:11:43.763 --> 01:11:46.498
50 minutes is $200.

01:11:46.531 --> 01:11:48.901
Please take a seat and
tell me your problems.

01:11:48.935 --> 01:11:50.803
Start with your childhood.

01:11:50.836 --> 01:11:52.570
No, nothing like that.

01:11:54.206 --> 01:11:56.541
The job can be a
lot for us, I know.

01:11:56.574 --> 01:11:58.543
It can really take its toll.

01:11:58.576 --> 01:12:01.047
While I have not been
in this room myself,

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:03.683
I have worked at clinics
like this for 15 years

01:12:03.716 --> 01:12:05.184
and I have seen
the impact it has

01:12:05.217 --> 01:12:08.453
on the mental well-being of
our marvelous professionals.

01:12:09.521 --> 01:12:11.190
You take a lot on.

01:12:11.223 --> 01:12:12.825
Some of it is really heavy,

01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:15.661
especially someone like yourself

01:12:15.695 --> 01:12:18.264
who's come out of working
with children's issues.

01:12:18.297 --> 01:12:20.498
I can only imagine the
horrors you have heard

01:12:20.532 --> 01:12:21.934
about on a daily basis.

01:12:21.968 --> 01:12:23.535
Is this a therapy
session, Helen?

01:12:23.568 --> 01:12:24.937
Because you're not qualified.

01:12:26.305 --> 01:12:28.274
No, no, no, it's
not professional,

01:12:28.307 --> 01:12:31.210
it's on a personal
level, a friendly level.

01:12:33.679 --> 01:12:35.047
There was a psychologist
who worked here

01:12:35.081 --> 01:12:36.282
long before you came along.

01:12:36.315 --> 01:12:39.885
And he, the job got too much.

01:12:41.921 --> 01:12:43.621
We don't have
to do this, Helen.

01:12:44.957 --> 01:12:46.826
He took his own
life one evening.

01:12:48.094 --> 01:12:50.629
Went home after seeing
10 patients that day.

01:12:51.664 --> 01:12:52.698
Hung himself.

01:12:54.767 --> 01:12:56.168
I'm not gonna kill myself.

01:12:57.770 --> 01:13:00.538
Well, you do
display some traits

01:13:00.572 --> 01:13:01.774
if you don't mind me saying.

01:13:06.112 --> 01:13:08.814
Humor is always a good way
of covering up our pain.

01:13:12.617 --> 01:13:14.954
The pain in people's
lives is not your problem

01:13:14.987 --> 01:13:16.222
nor your responsibility.

01:13:16.255 --> 01:13:18.057
You can only do so much.

01:13:19.258 --> 01:13:21.127
I'm aware of this,
Helen, thank you.

01:13:22.261 --> 01:13:25.631
And I know that
Mitchell was a patient

01:13:25.664 --> 01:13:26.899
of yours for a while.

01:13:26.932 --> 01:13:29.735
And you had a soft spot
for the children you saw.

01:13:31.237 --> 01:13:32.972
Why are you
bringing up Mitchell?

01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:37.609
He spoke out against a man
named Geoffrey Callaghan.

01:13:38.610 --> 01:13:41.347
Accused him of the unspeakable.

01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:44.083
And the man was murdered
during his house arrest.

01:13:44.116 --> 01:13:47.585
And now Mitchell has come
out confessing he lied.

01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:52.291
It's not your fault the boy
lied and you believed him.

01:13:52.324 --> 01:13:54.326
It's not your fault you cared.

01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:55.895
I would've done the same thing.

01:13:58.197 --> 01:13:59.765
How do you know this?

01:13:59.799 --> 01:14:01.033
How do you know anything?

01:14:02.701 --> 01:14:04.236
Have you been
eavesdropping, Helen?

01:14:05.371 --> 01:14:08.774
Because it was all over the
news this morning, Jessie.

01:14:10.242 --> 01:14:12.178
He confessed to lying.

01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:15.848
Mitchell was on the news?

01:14:17.883 --> 01:14:18.684
No dear.

01:14:20.052 --> 01:14:21.087
His mother was.

01:14:23.122 --> 01:14:25.057
She read out his suicide note.

01:14:39.371 --> 01:14:40.873
I'm sorry, Jessie.

01:16:53.038 --> 01:16:54.740
What the hell
do I do with you?

01:16:58.077 --> 01:16:59.845
What do I do with you?

01:17:27.873 --> 01:17:28.507
Grace.

01:18:08.247 --> 01:18:10.816
It was so easy to get you here.

01:18:12.184 --> 01:18:16.088
Tie you up, starve you,
deprive you of dignity.

01:18:20.426 --> 01:18:23.595
But then I discovered something.

01:18:23.630 --> 01:18:28.834
Something from my old life
and it put me off my game.

01:18:31.638 --> 01:18:33.605
That never happens.

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:36.208
I assure you, it never happens.

01:18:40.245 --> 01:18:42.581
So it seems that there is

01:18:46.185 --> 01:18:47.453
a different side to a story.

01:18:50.456 --> 01:18:53.258
That you were this
victim of circumstances.

01:18:55.127 --> 01:18:57.296
But you kept pleading
to the court.

01:18:57.329 --> 01:18:59.565
I promise I didn't
hurt those kids.

01:18:59.598 --> 01:19:03.268
It was like you said, a
victim of the circumstances.

01:19:05.037 --> 01:19:06.372
My boyfriend took
them off the street.

01:19:06.405 --> 01:19:07.406
He did the bad shit.

01:19:08.307 --> 01:19:09.341
Bad shit?

01:19:10.609 --> 01:19:14.313
Yeah, the trafficking.

01:19:18.083 --> 01:19:20.085
You sold those
children to pedophiles.

01:19:24.657 --> 01:19:26.659
I was a victim myself.

01:19:26.693 --> 01:19:29.027
The court saw that,
everybody did.

01:19:29.061 --> 01:19:31.296
That's why they gave me
a retrial, let me go,

01:19:31.330 --> 01:19:32.331
took mercy on me.

01:19:34.366 --> 01:19:36.101
You know, you're more
likely to get killed

01:19:36.135 --> 01:19:37.236
by your partner after you leave

01:19:37.269 --> 01:19:38.604
not while you're with them.

01:19:40.105 --> 01:19:42.074
So you know that's why I stayed.

01:19:44.243 --> 01:19:46.278
You could have
everybody on your street

01:19:46.311 --> 01:19:48.180
be your friend and offer
you a couch to sleep on.

01:19:48.213 --> 01:19:52.050
But that's not gonna
change the stats.

01:19:52.084 --> 01:19:54.153
And that's not gonna
change the odds.

01:19:54.186 --> 01:19:55.354
They're against you.

01:19:57.256 --> 01:19:58.924
You leave, you're dead.

01:20:01.226 --> 01:20:02.294
That's interesting.

01:20:06.565 --> 01:20:07.433
Stand up.

01:20:10.335 --> 01:20:12.438
Walk over there.

01:20:12.471 --> 01:20:15.107
Open up the first drawer.

01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:16.141
- Why?
- Go.

01:20:33.025 --> 01:20:34.326
Take out what's in the drawer.

01:20:45.437 --> 01:20:47.005
Put it around your neck.

01:20:53.512 --> 01:20:54.346
Go on.

01:20:56.415 --> 01:20:57.449
Go on.

01:21:03.723 --> 01:21:05.224
How do you feel?

01:21:11.530 --> 01:21:12.498
I feel sick.

01:21:13.398 --> 01:21:14.399
Keep going.

01:21:15.501 --> 01:21:18.403
I'm scared and
I wanna go home.

01:21:24.209 --> 01:21:25.043
Tighten it.

01:21:39.626 --> 01:21:40.693
Keep going.

01:21:51.503 --> 01:21:54.774
So going back to
what you were saying,

01:21:56.408 --> 01:21:58.610
as long as you stayed you
were pretty much assured

01:21:58.645 --> 01:22:00.212
that he would not kill you.

01:22:01.179 --> 01:22:03.081
I stayed because I was afraid

01:22:03.115 --> 01:22:04.483
if that's what you're asking.

01:22:04.516 --> 01:22:08.320
What I'm telling
you is, if you had not

01:22:08.353 --> 01:22:09.722
helped him with his
little business,

01:22:09.756 --> 01:22:12.692
he would not have killed you
as long as you stayed put.

01:22:15.294 --> 01:22:16.228
He beat me.

01:22:16.261 --> 01:22:17.496
I was afraid that he might.

01:22:17.529 --> 01:22:19.766
I did what he said
because I was afraid.

01:22:21.133 --> 01:22:22.267
Not for your life.

01:22:23.569 --> 01:22:26.271
Your life was fine as long
as you did not leave him.

01:22:26.305 --> 01:22:28.273
You said so yourself.

01:22:28.307 --> 01:22:29.308
Stats show.

01:22:31.209 --> 01:22:32.144
But you helped him.

01:22:33.278 --> 01:22:34.681
You helped him steal
those children.

01:22:34.714 --> 01:22:37.583
So surely there was nothing
to warrant a beating

01:22:37.616 --> 01:22:39.618
because there was
no disobedience.

01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:43.188
He trafficked 87 children
and you helped him

01:22:43.221 --> 01:22:47.694
with each and every single
one of those 87 children.

01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:49.629
You did as he told you.

01:22:50.930 --> 01:22:52.632
So what was his reasoning
for beating you?

01:22:53.866 --> 01:22:55.835
I don't know, he
just beat me anyway.

01:22:57.202 --> 01:22:57.837
Exactly.

01:23:01.239 --> 01:23:04.109
He was violent to you whether
you helped him or not.

01:23:04.911 --> 01:23:06.612
Yet you chose to help him.

01:23:06.646 --> 01:23:08.648
You chose to lure
those children in

01:23:09.649 --> 01:23:11.550
and rip them from
their childhood.

01:23:15.755 --> 01:23:17.589
He beat me, I was afraid.

01:23:22.829 --> 01:23:27.332
You did not help him because
you were afraid of his fist.

01:23:29.669 --> 01:23:34.674
You helped him because he
loved you when you did.

01:23:41.346 --> 01:23:44.416
You had their small hands in
yours and you betrayed them.

01:23:49.588 --> 01:23:51.891
All for the love of a monster.

01:27:01.047 --> 01:27:03.683
First I thought it
was your workbook.

01:27:03.716 --> 01:27:05.517
Notes from sessions
with clients,

01:27:05.550 --> 01:27:06.986
a description of their thoughts.

01:27:07.019 --> 01:27:11.456
But what have you been doing
when nobody is watching?

01:27:11.489 --> 01:27:12.992
I need my diary back, Helen.

01:27:24.103 --> 01:27:28.074
Shh.

01:27:28.107 --> 01:27:33.112
I'm not gonna hurt you, Helen.

01:27:59.504 --> 01:28:00.973
I need the police.

01:28:58.230 --> 01:29:00.766
She's quite the decorator.

01:29:16.315 --> 01:29:17.549
Hancock?

01:29:35.634 --> 01:29:37.602
That's Grace O'Connell.

01:29:37.636 --> 01:29:39.005
She's the convicted
child trafficker

01:29:39.038 --> 01:29:41.207
that got recently released.

01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:42.074
Yeah.

01:29:44.243 --> 01:29:47.213
She's supposed to check in with
her case worker once a day.

01:29:48.613 --> 01:29:49.915
Let's see if she's checked in.

01:30:01.694 --> 01:30:03.763
Yes, Jane Simmons, please.

01:30:03.796 --> 01:30:05.164
Detective Hancock.

01:30:21.747 --> 01:30:24.616
They're all pedophiles.

01:30:24.650 --> 01:30:25.251
Hello, Jane?

01:30:25.284 --> 01:30:26.652
Yeah, Detective Hancock.

01:30:26.685 --> 01:30:29.055
Look, I'm calling
about Grace O'Connell.

01:30:29.088 --> 01:30:31.857
Yes, I believe she's supposed
to check in once a day.

01:30:33.759 --> 01:30:35.161
I knew there was
a link, I knew it.

01:30:37.997 --> 01:30:40.733
They're all linked, I knew it.

01:30:43.202 --> 01:30:44.370
Can you do me a
favor, can you give me

01:30:44.403 --> 01:30:46.072
a call back on this
number if she checks in?

01:30:47.406 --> 01:30:50.276
Yeah, thanks, I appreciate that.

01:30:50.309 --> 01:30:53.679
Thanks, talk to you
soon, bye bye now.

01:30:56.682 --> 01:30:57.983
Has she checked in?

01:30:58.017 --> 01:30:59.185
No, and the
refuge hasn't seen her

01:30:59.218 --> 01:31:00.820
for the last couple of days.

01:31:03.289 --> 01:31:04.824
These are all pedophiles.

01:31:10.062 --> 01:31:11.697
We have to find this place.

01:31:13.899 --> 01:31:14.667
Now.

01:31:45.064 --> 01:31:45.898
Hi, Charlie.

01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:49.034
I'm well.

01:31:50.269 --> 01:31:51.670
I had a bit of a rough day

01:31:51.704 --> 01:31:53.105
so I just want to
hear your voice.

01:31:54.206 --> 01:31:55.741
No, no, nothing serious.

01:31:56.842 --> 01:31:58.244
Just counseling stuff.

01:32:00.012 --> 01:32:02.781
Taking on too much of my
patients' issues, I guess.

01:32:03.816 --> 01:32:06.118
So just distract me, talk to me.

01:32:06.152 --> 01:32:07.786
Tell me about your day.

01:32:13.225 --> 01:32:14.793
It's good, Charlie.

01:32:16.462 --> 01:32:17.263
It's good.

01:32:26.038 --> 01:32:26.872
Hmm.

01:32:28.340 --> 01:32:30.776
Yeah, I told you, I'm fine.

01:32:32.144 --> 01:32:33.779
Charlie, I need to get going.

01:32:36.815 --> 01:32:38.784
I just want to tell
you I love you.

01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:45.925
You have been my sanity
and my best friend.

01:32:47.993 --> 01:32:49.428
I just love you so much.

01:33:05.844 --> 01:33:08.247
Hey, lost you
there for a moment.

01:33:11.250 --> 01:33:12.952
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:33:12.985 --> 01:33:16.956
I told you, I'm just having
a proud older sister moment.

01:33:20.859 --> 01:33:21.894
I have to go, Charlie.

01:33:24.997 --> 01:33:26.398
You take care, sis, okay?

01:33:30.069 --> 01:33:30.970
I love you.

01:35:51.944 --> 01:35:53.145
What's the situation?

01:35:53.178 --> 01:35:54.647
Looks like we're too late.

01:35:54.681 --> 01:35:56.548
No one's home.

01:36:09.428 --> 01:36:12.297
Detectives, thanks for coming.

01:36:13.733 --> 01:36:15.567
What
have you got for us?

01:36:15.601 --> 01:36:16.602
The house was already vacated

01:36:16.636 --> 01:36:18.337
by the time our team got here.

01:36:18.370 --> 01:36:20.172
Jessie Fuller was long gone.

01:36:20.205 --> 01:36:21.373
Come through.

01:36:27.246 --> 01:36:29.581
This is a really strange
place, I have to say.

01:36:29.615 --> 01:36:31.583
Yeah, why is that?

01:36:32.985 --> 01:36:35.487
Place is connected
by underground tunnels.

01:36:35.521 --> 01:36:37.122
It's a bunker full of supplies.

01:36:37.156 --> 01:36:40.526
It's got canned vegetables
and beans, beers.

01:36:40.559 --> 01:36:43.395
It's like some kind
of doomsday shit.

01:36:43.429 --> 01:36:44.396
Yeah, right.

01:36:45.297 --> 01:36:48.300
This place isn't in
Fuller's name either.

01:36:48.333 --> 01:36:50.402
You won't believe
who it belongs to.

01:36:50.436 --> 01:36:51.570
Who?

01:36:51.603 --> 01:36:53.138
Ever heard of Harry Holmes?

01:36:53.172 --> 01:36:54.540
Pedophile rapist?

01:36:55.642 --> 01:36:57.476
Yeah, I know him.

01:36:58.177 --> 01:37:00.045
He was sentenced for 15 years.

01:37:00.078 --> 01:37:02.715
But soon after his release
he was off our radar.

01:37:02.749 --> 01:37:04.149
Not surprising.

01:37:04.183 --> 01:37:05.317
I'm sure we'll find
his mugshot somewhere

01:37:05.350 --> 01:37:06.452
in Fuller's apartment.

01:37:08.287 --> 01:37:11.223
Tell me, what do you know
about about Fuller's character?

01:37:12.391 --> 01:37:15.127
I did a bit of digging
on the way up here.

01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:19.465
Jessie Fuller, age
32, PhD in psychology.

01:37:20.466 --> 01:37:24.236
Served in the military, front
lines in the psych unit.

01:37:24.269 --> 01:37:28.040
Did one tour in Iraq and
two tours at Afghanistan.

01:37:28.073 --> 01:37:29.208
Right.

01:37:29.241 --> 01:37:31.343
Then she moved into private
practice several years ago.

01:37:31.376 --> 01:37:33.445
She's a practicing psychologist

01:37:33.479 --> 01:37:35.748
and had been there ever since.

01:37:35.782 --> 01:37:37.449
One, she does have
a younger sister

01:37:37.483 --> 01:37:40.486
who works as a nurse at
a retirement village.

01:37:40.519 --> 01:37:44.423
Now she states that
she has no idea

01:37:44.456 --> 01:37:48.126
how any of the things got
into Jessie's apartment.

01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:49.495
Our team's still
interviewing her.

01:37:49.528 --> 01:37:50.395
The diary.

01:37:51.798 --> 01:37:54.433
The one the receptionist
called in about.

01:37:54.466 --> 01:37:55.735
It's all in here.

01:37:55.768 --> 01:37:58.638
Descriptions of the
killings, drawings.

01:38:00.472 --> 01:38:01.674
She knew we were coming.

01:38:03.609 --> 01:38:05.377
She wanted us to find her.

01:38:09.515 --> 01:38:10.449
Bag and tag that.

01:38:17.657 --> 01:38:20.559
You guys finished now with the
photos and prints, et cetera?

01:38:20.592 --> 01:38:21.761
Absolutely.

01:38:31.603 --> 01:38:33.372
Where are you, Jessie Fuller?
