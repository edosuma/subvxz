00:09.210 --> 00:12.211
(horn honking outside)

00:19.687 --> 00:21.687
(echoing):
<i> Where are you going?</i>

00:21.689 --> 00:23.722
<i> I'm gonna go see some friends.</i>

00:23.724 --> 00:25.524
<i> No, those guys</i>
<i> are not your friends.</i>

00:25.526 --> 00:26.592
<i> You're just business to them.</i>

00:26.594 --> 00:27.760
Just let go.
No.

00:27.762 --> 00:29.728
<i> I am not going to let them</i>

00:29.730 --> 00:30.662
suck the life out of you.

00:30.664 --> 00:32.031
Come on, Jimmy.

00:32.033 --> 00:33.332
<i> Jimmy.</i>

00:33.334 --> 00:35.034
<i> Help me save him!</i>

00:35.036 --> 00:37.336
He's my brother.
Come on, Jimmy.
It's too late.

00:48.783 --> 00:50.783
Uh, excuse me.

00:50.785 --> 00:52.551
I heard you threw Donnie
out of here last night.

00:52.553 --> 00:53.685
Is that true?

00:53.687 --> 00:54.686
Is it true?

00:54.688 --> 00:56.188
This is my place.

00:56.190 --> 00:58.090
I get to decide who
comes in, who doesn't.

00:58.092 --> 00:59.591
What have you got
against our friend Donnie?

00:59.593 --> 01:01.160
I mean, what's wrong
with a guy who wants

01:01.162 --> 01:03.695
to sit at a bar,
have a quiet conversation?

01:03.697 --> 01:05.798
I don't like him doing
business in my place.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.633
He's welcome to do
it someplace else.

01:07.635 --> 01:08.834
You're messing
with our business.

01:08.836 --> 01:10.636
And when you mess
with our business,

01:10.638 --> 01:12.704
we mess with yours.
What are you doing?

01:13.674 --> 01:15.140
(concerned voices)

01:15.142 --> 01:16.809
Hey.

01:16.811 --> 01:20.079
No, don't. Please!

01:20.081 --> 01:21.647
Oh, you sons of bitches.

01:21.649 --> 01:22.648
Language.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.249
This is a family establishment.

01:24.251 --> 01:25.717
Come on, guys.

01:25.719 --> 01:26.852
Let's talk this over.

01:26.854 --> 01:28.187
Please.

01:28.189 --> 01:29.788
He's a local dealer.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.557
(glass shattering)

01:31.559 --> 01:32.825
Stop!

01:32.827 --> 01:35.527
You have
to get down here.
Come on, guys.

01:35.529 --> 01:37.229
The Gatto Nero, College Street.

01:38.265 --> 01:39.665
Stop!

01:39.667 --> 01:41.533
You don't need
to do that, guys.

01:41.535 --> 01:42.668
Stop!

01:42.670 --> 01:43.836
Bastards.

01:43.838 --> 01:45.204
(glass breaking)

01:45.206 --> 01:46.371
(liquid pouring)

01:46.373 --> 01:48.240
Don't touch that.

01:48.242 --> 01:49.508
Don't touch that.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.176
No.

01:51.178 --> 01:52.611
That belonged to my wife.

01:52.613 --> 01:53.846
What do you think, Vince?

01:53.848 --> 01:55.481
Nice.
Crystal.

01:55.482 --> 01:57.115
You know I bought something
like this for my mom once.

01:57.118 --> 01:58.283
Cost a couple stacks.

01:58.285 --> 01:59.451
What's this cost?

01:59.453 --> 02:00.819
It's not about
what it costs.

02:00.821 --> 02:03.122
Please.

02:03.124 --> 02:04.156
Please.

02:07.728 --> 02:10.162
(coughing)
Back off!

02:11.265 --> 02:12.798
Your call.

02:14.435 --> 02:15.901
Oh, my God.
(groaning)

02:15.903 --> 02:17.302
He has a gun.

02:17.304 --> 02:18.670
Please hurry.

02:18.672 --> 02:20.739
(groaning)

02:22.376 --> 02:24.376
You all right?

02:24.378 --> 02:25.644
Yeah, yeah.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.913
Watch it!

02:27.915 --> 02:29.848
What-What are you doing?
Let it go.

02:29.850 --> 02:32.751
I'm not letting it go.

02:37.858 --> 02:41.293
WORDY:
Oh, Shelley,
one more thing.

02:41.295 --> 02:43.295
Um, you want to go
to Eddie's tonight?

02:43.297 --> 02:44.496
Barbecue, kids.

02:44.498 --> 02:45.664
What time?

02:45.666 --> 02:46.899
I don't know.
Like, 6:00?

02:46.901 --> 02:47.866
WINNIE:
Team one. Hot call.

02:47.868 --> 02:50.235
12 Clouster Street. Shots fired.

02:50.237 --> 02:51.170
Better make it 8:00.

02:51.172 --> 02:53.305
8:00. Love ya. Got to go.

02:53.307 --> 02:54.840
Team one,
seconds away.
Copy.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.675
(siren blaring)
SPIKE:
Copy.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.744
Copy. Command truck's
on its way.

03:00.548 --> 03:02.648
(siren blaring)

03:04.485 --> 03:06.818
(sirens blaring)

03:16.664 --> 03:19.431
First responder.
Talk to me fast, Officer.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.600
We got two males, baseball
bats and a handgun,

03:21.602 --> 03:22.935
start tearing
the place apart.

03:22.937 --> 03:25.437
Patron jumps in, the gun
discharges, everybody runs.

03:25.439 --> 03:26.672
Whose gun?

03:26.674 --> 03:27.839
The guys wrecking the bar.

03:27.841 --> 03:28.807
You get a description?

03:28.809 --> 03:31.243
Yup. Mid-20s, long coats.

03:31.245 --> 03:32.811
One's six-four
with dreadlocks.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.580
Injury on the right arm.

03:34.581 --> 03:36.348
The other's a small build,
jeans, black T-shirt.

03:36.350 --> 03:37.883
No word on the good Samaritan.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.251
Good Samaritan?

03:39.253 --> 03:40.419
That's what the
owner called him.

03:40.421 --> 03:41.820
Thanks, Officer.
Sam, you get

03:41.822 --> 03:43.288
those
descriptions?
Yeah.

03:43.290 --> 03:44.923
Well, we're right behind
'em. We move fast...

03:44.925 --> 03:45.891
We can bring them in.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.259
Okay, we work a grid.

03:47.261 --> 03:48.427
Wordy, you are Alpha with me.

03:48.429 --> 03:49.595
We will work north and south.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.296
Sam, Leah, Bravo, east and west.

03:51.298 --> 03:52.531
Let's move it.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.700
Jules, let's see
what we can find out.

03:55.803 --> 03:58.937
Do you know why these men
would be targeting your place?

03:58.939 --> 04:00.472
They're drug dealers.

04:00.473 --> 04:02.006
I threw out one of their friends
last night.

04:02.009 --> 04:02.975
You stood up to them.

04:02.977 --> 04:04.776
This is what it got me.

04:04.778 --> 04:06.612
You know the men
who did this?

04:06.613 --> 04:08.447
Leon is the little one,
Vince is the big one.

04:08.449 --> 04:09.615
That's all I know.

04:09.617 --> 04:10.816
And who's the man

04:10.818 --> 04:12.618
who attacked them?
He didn't
attack them.

04:12.620 --> 04:13.919
He chased them out.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.687
I didn't get a look at him.

04:15.689 --> 04:16.922
Did he take his handgun?

04:16.924 --> 04:18.557
Two against one.

04:18.559 --> 04:21.026
I'm just wondering how
he managed to chase them out.

04:25.466 --> 04:27.666
Yeah, he had the gun.

04:35.909 --> 04:38.410
It's sick.

04:38.412 --> 04:40.412
What are you
talking about?

04:40.414 --> 04:41.647
I grew up here.

04:41.649 --> 04:42.881
I didn't
know that.
Yeah.

04:42.883 --> 04:45.384
Used to be kids in
the streets all hours,

04:45.386 --> 04:47.786
hide and seek,
people outside on their patios.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.855
You sitting on the
back of a pickup,

04:49.857 --> 04:51.923
strumming your first guitar.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.959
I just hate
to see what's happened.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.994
I hear you, Wordy, but you
got to talk to city hall.

04:55.996 --> 04:58.797
There were a lot more cops
on the street back then.

04:58.799 --> 04:59.965
PARKER:
Team One, turns out,

04:59.967 --> 05:01.333
our good Samaritan is armed.

05:01.335 --> 05:02.501
Got ID?

05:02.503 --> 05:03.669
Not yet,
but he may be going after

05:03.671 --> 05:04.970
the same target as you.

05:04.972 --> 05:05.937
So, what, we got
some citizen

05:05.939 --> 05:06.938
trying to be
a vigilante?

05:06.940 --> 05:08.040
Looks that way.

05:08.042 --> 05:09.408
Vigilante?

05:09.410 --> 05:10.776
What would
you call him?

05:10.778 --> 05:13.745
Some guys try to intimidate
a local businessman,

05:13.747 --> 05:15.914
this guy steps up, fights back,

05:15.916 --> 05:17.983
I'd call him a good citizen.

05:17.985 --> 05:21.053
A good citizen in
pursuit with a firearm.

05:30.331 --> 05:31.963
Hey.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.398
It's okay.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.067
It's o... It's okay.

05:35.069 --> 05:36.968
How you doing, Leon?
I'm good.
How about you?

05:36.970 --> 05:39.404
Proud of yourself? You get a
rush out of what you did?

05:39.406 --> 05:42.507
Huh? Takes a big man to
bust up someone's place.

05:42.509 --> 05:43.926
Someone's treasures.

05:43.927 --> 05:45.344
Pieces of a life
that they actually worked for.

05:45.346 --> 05:46.511
Takes a real big man.

05:46.513 --> 05:47.679
What do you want?

05:47.681 --> 05:49.114
You just tell me what you want.

05:52.986 --> 05:55.354
So you got no idea
what he looks like?

05:55.356 --> 05:56.855
Tall, short, heavyset,
blonde, brunette?

05:56.857 --> 05:58.023
Stop me here.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.191
No, nothing's coming to you?

05:59.192 --> 06:00.358
Everything happened
really fast.

06:00.361 --> 06:01.727
JULES:
You got a
pretty good look

06:01.729 --> 06:03.028
of the other two guys.

06:04.631 --> 06:07.032
Alphonse, look, I realize
he did you a favor,

06:07.034 --> 06:10.001
but he chased two men out
of here with a loaded weapon,

06:10.003 --> 06:11.770
and we'd like to help him

06:11.772 --> 06:13.405
before he gets in
too deep.

06:13.407 --> 06:15.440
I never saw him before.

06:15.442 --> 06:16.441
You sure about that?

06:16.443 --> 06:17.709
Absolutely.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.478
What about you, ma'am?

06:19.480 --> 06:20.979
Do you remember
anything?

06:20.981 --> 06:22.147
I just...

06:22.149 --> 06:24.082
I was in the
back here.

06:24.084 --> 06:25.984
I didn't see
the guy at all.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.519
Mm-hmm.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.063
Ed, uniforms called in a man

06:38.065 --> 06:39.531
in dreads and a long coat
running south

06:39.533 --> 06:40.699
on Parliament Street.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.033
Dreadlocks, 3:00 o'clock.

06:44.772 --> 06:47.706
(tires squealing)

06:49.109 --> 06:52.043
In pursuit on foot,
corner of Montrose and College.

07:23.177 --> 07:25.076
¶ ¶

07:42.629 --> 07:44.463
Ed. Right there.
Right there!

07:44.465 --> 07:45.630
Stay there!
Right now!

07:45.632 --> 07:46.832
Right there!
Do not move!

07:46.834 --> 07:48.099
WORDY:
Do not move!

07:48.101 --> 07:50.101
Give me your hands!
Let me see your hands!

07:50.103 --> 07:51.069
Let me see your hands!

07:51.071 --> 07:52.604
You got any
weapons?

07:52.606 --> 07:53.772
Get up!
(groans)

07:53.774 --> 07:54.940
It's dislocated.

07:54.942 --> 07:56.107
What's your name?

07:56.109 --> 07:57.242
What's your name?!

07:58.111 --> 07:59.077
What's up, Eddie?

07:59.079 --> 08:01.046
ED:
Boss, we got one

08:01.047 --> 08:03.014
of the dealers-- the name
he gave is Vince Packer.

08:03.016 --> 08:06.017
Okay, Spike, see if you can get
anything on a Vince Packer.

08:06.019 --> 08:08.403
On it, boss.

08:08.404 --> 08:10.788
Look for any connections
to someone named Leon.

08:10.791 --> 08:13.191
Our friend Vince denies
vandalizing the Gatto Nero,

08:13.193 --> 08:14.693
or knowing anybody
named Leon.

08:14.695 --> 08:15.994
Apparently,
he dislocated his shoulder

08:15.996 --> 08:17.913
playing hockey
this morning.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.831
In a neighborhood that lost
its rink five years ago.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.167
SPIKE:
Ed,

08:22.168 --> 08:24.502
your guy, Vince-- he gets busted
a lot for such a good athlete.

08:24.505 --> 08:25.737
Possession, assault.

08:25.739 --> 08:26.938
And look at this.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.206
Last time he went down,

08:28.208 --> 08:30.775
he went down
with fellow athlete Leon Weeks.

08:30.777 --> 08:31.977
Where can we
find Mr. Weeks?

08:31.979 --> 08:33.144
If he's headed home,

08:33.146 --> 08:34.663
he's right in the neighborhood.

08:34.664 --> 08:36.181
211 Watson.
That's Clouster and Watson.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.582
Two blocks from us.

08:37.584 --> 08:38.917
We're on it.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.755
(two gunshots)

08:43.757 --> 08:45.190
Shots fired!

08:45.192 --> 08:47.792
Alley west of Clouster.

08:47.794 --> 08:49.861
On it.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.965
(man screaming)

08:56.136 --> 08:59.938
Sam, this guy's
really a mess.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.172
(screaming continues)

09:01.174 --> 09:03.275
Winnie, we need
an ambulance.

09:03.277 --> 09:04.843
Bad news, boss.

09:04.845 --> 09:07.913
Vigilante has kicked it up
a notch.

09:07.915 --> 09:13.251
  Captioning sponsored by
  CBS

09:44.985 --> 09:46.251
(screaming)

09:46.253 --> 09:48.286
Winnie, where's that ambulance?

09:48.288 --> 09:50.789
Sending EMTs
to your GPS location now.

09:50.791 --> 09:51.856
Talk to me, Sam.

09:51.858 --> 09:53.925
Subject from the bar
has been shot.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.694
Bullet wounds in both legs.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.329
It's nasty,
but it's not life-threatening.

09:57.331 --> 09:58.997
Looks like he was carrying

09:58.999 --> 09:59.965
some cocaine.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.800
This is circumstantial!

10:01.802 --> 10:03.935
You're Leon Weeks, right?

10:03.937 --> 10:05.036
I want a lawyer.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.671
I know my rights.

10:06.673 --> 10:08.607
We're not here
about the drugs.
Oh, yeah, right.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.292
I know how this works.

10:10.293 --> 10:11.976
You're gonna plant some drugs,
then you're gonna try

10:11.979 --> 10:13.479
and pin it on me.

10:13.480 --> 10:14.980
Leon, we just want to know
who shot you, that's all.

10:14.982 --> 10:17.782
Cooper. Robert Cooper.

10:17.784 --> 10:20.385
C-O-O...
Thanks, Leon. We
got the spelling.

10:20.387 --> 10:21.786
Spike, you copy that?

10:21.788 --> 10:23.021
P-E-R.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.789
Get right back to you.

10:24.791 --> 10:25.957
Robert Cooper.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.325
Oh, what, do
you know him?

10:27.327 --> 10:28.693
Not well.

10:28.695 --> 10:30.695
My dad and I used to hang out

10:30.697 --> 10:32.831
at his dad's hardware store
all the time.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.434
(siren blaring)

10:35.435 --> 10:38.036
Robert Cooper's taking this
pretty personally, Leon.

10:38.038 --> 10:40.038
Now, is there something
here you want to tell me?

10:40.040 --> 10:41.206
Like why he'd want
to shoot you?

10:41.208 --> 10:42.941
The guy's a wacko.
He's out of control.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.042
You got to stop him, okay?

10:44.044 --> 10:45.210
WORDY:
Maybe Cooper's

10:45.212 --> 10:47.078
not fond of people
in your line of work.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.647
I said
this is circumstantial.

10:48.649 --> 10:49.814
Uh-huh.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.049
(groaning):
Oh!

10:51.051 --> 10:52.851
(panting)

10:52.853 --> 10:54.603
Guys, listen to this.

10:54.604 --> 10:56.354
"The West End Neighborhood
Sentinel Association

10:56.356 --> 10:58.256
"won a court battle
which would have

10:58.258 --> 11:00.725
"the Imperial Arms Apartments
torn down.

11:00.727 --> 11:02.360
"The president
and local businessman

11:02.362 --> 11:04.362
"Robert Cooper said
the association has

11:04.364 --> 11:06.798
"dealt a body blow
to the drug dealers

11:06.800 --> 11:08.733
trying to take over
our neighborhood."

11:08.735 --> 11:10.435
From community activist
to vigilante.

11:10.437 --> 11:11.970
SPIKE (over headset):
Sending you a picture of him

11:11.972 --> 11:13.338
right now.

11:14.875 --> 11:18.777
Alphonse, you know it's illegal
to lie to the police.

11:18.779 --> 11:20.111
Right?

11:20.113 --> 11:22.947
Robert Cooper was
your Good Samaritan.

11:22.949 --> 11:25.050
Now, how do you not

11:25.052 --> 11:27.218
recognize the president
of your Neighborhood Sentinel.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.987
I didn't want
to get him in trouble.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.155
He just shot a man.

11:30.157 --> 11:31.856
Oh, my God.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.158
PARKER:
Yeah, it might not
have happened if you'd

11:33.160 --> 11:34.959
given us a straight answer.

11:34.961 --> 11:36.327
JULES:
Alphonse, we need
to bring him in here

11:36.329 --> 11:37.862
before he hurts any body else.

11:37.863 --> 11:39.396
You got an address, a phone
number-- anything you got?

11:39.399 --> 11:40.331
I don't know
where he's living.

11:40.333 --> 11:41.966
You'll have
to ask his wife.

11:41.968 --> 11:43.935
What's her name?
Patty Cooper.

11:43.937 --> 11:45.270
Let's get her
down here, Jules.

11:48.241 --> 11:51.109
Leon, we need to talk to you
about your crew, buddy.

11:51.111 --> 11:53.111
I don't know. What crew?

11:53.112 --> 11:55.112
Cooper's declared war.
You think he's going
to stop with you?

11:55.115 --> 11:57.248
He wanted me to give up
names and addresses

11:57.250 --> 11:59.350
for the guys I work with--
the top guys.

11:59.352 --> 12:01.252
Did you tell him?
I don't know the top guys.

12:01.254 --> 12:02.754
I only talk to Torres.

12:02.756 --> 12:03.988
Torres?
John Torres.

12:03.990 --> 12:05.757
He's a middle guy.

12:05.759 --> 12:08.059
That's all I know.
That's all I told him.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.862
All right, let's see
what we can find out
about this Torres.

12:10.864 --> 12:12.897
You think he's going to go after
every dealer in the area?

12:12.899 --> 12:14.199
Could take a while
in this neighborhood.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.335
Sorry, Leah, what about
this neighborhood?

12:17.337 --> 12:18.803
When I was
a firefighter,

12:18.805 --> 12:20.271
I took a lot
of drug-related calls,

12:20.273 --> 12:22.207
especially in this
neighborhood.

12:31.017 --> 12:32.784
But Bobby doesn't own a gun.

12:32.786 --> 12:34.352
It appears he took it

12:34.353 --> 12:35.919
from one of the men
that he assaulted this morning.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.021
We believe Robert's
been hunting down

12:37.023 --> 12:38.823
a local gang of drug dealers.

12:38.825 --> 12:41.092
Did you know that
he was planning on doing
something like that?

12:41.094 --> 12:44.162
No. No, God, no.

12:44.164 --> 12:45.530
I would've called
the police immediately.

12:45.532 --> 12:47.165
Well, we need to know
what made him do this.

12:47.167 --> 12:49.134
Can you tell us about
his state of mind lately?

12:49.136 --> 12:50.935
He's angry.

12:50.937 --> 12:52.437
About what happened
to the neighborhood,

12:52.439 --> 12:53.905
about what happened
to his brother.

12:53.907 --> 12:56.407
His brother?
Jimmy. He's...

12:56.409 --> 12:58.409
He's younger.

12:58.411 --> 13:01.045
They never really
had an easy time.
Their mom died

13:01.047 --> 13:04.315
a long time ago, so it was just
Bobby and Jimmy and their dad.

13:04.317 --> 13:06.151
They were close, and then me.

13:06.153 --> 13:08.887
For a few years,
we ran the store together.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.557
We were happy.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.094
We were good.

13:16.096 --> 13:17.829
What happened?
Their dad died

13:17.831 --> 13:22.000
and... and Jimmy started using.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.234
Jimmy became an addict?

13:23.236 --> 13:24.402
Not overnight.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.237
It was a long slide down.

13:26.239 --> 13:28.940
We lost the Jimmy that we loved.

13:28.942 --> 13:31.142
We tried to help him.
We did the best we could.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.250
Jimmy.
Hey.

13:39.252 --> 13:40.819
How're you guys doing?

13:40.821 --> 13:42.320
What can I get you?
I just got a call from Gordie.

13:42.322 --> 13:43.488
Where the hell were you?

13:43.490 --> 13:46.224
Ah, jeez. Man, 3:30.

13:46.226 --> 13:47.525
You told me
you wanted to work

13:47.527 --> 13:49.127
in the dealership.
I put my neck on the line.

13:49.129 --> 13:50.929
I get the job for you...
Okay, enough.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.864
I get the message.

13:52.866 --> 13:54.265
Loud and clear.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.868
I let you down... again.

13:57.871 --> 13:59.103
Where are you going?

13:59.105 --> 14:01.506
I'm going to go meet
some friends.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.943
Hey!

14:04.945 --> 14:08.313
I know who you mean,
and those guys are
not your friends.

14:08.315 --> 14:09.547
Now, you're going to tell me
who my friends are?

14:09.549 --> 14:10.915
Get the hell off me.

14:10.917 --> 14:12.984
You're not their
friend, Jimmy, okay?

14:12.986 --> 14:14.252
You're just business to them.

14:14.254 --> 14:16.120
You son of a bitch,
just... let go.

14:16.122 --> 14:18.223
No. No. Hey, listen
to me, all right?

14:18.225 --> 14:19.490
I am not going
to let them suck

14:19.492 --> 14:21.492
the life out of you.
Let me go.

14:21.494 --> 14:23.962
Just let go!

14:32.005 --> 14:35.073
If you walk out of that door,
I am done with you.

14:46.152 --> 14:47.919
I didn't mean that.
I know.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.324
I'm going to go. No.
Bobby. Bobby...

14:54.661 --> 14:56.928
Jimmy!

15:01.968 --> 15:04.235
<i> He's not going to give up</i>
<i> looking for him.</i>

15:04.237 --> 15:06.070
When was the last time
you two spoke?

15:06.072 --> 15:08.640
When he ran after Jimmy

15:08.642 --> 15:11.309
about two days ago.
Do you mind me asking

15:11.311 --> 15:12.343
why he left?

15:15.515 --> 15:18.483
Losing the store,
losing Jimmy...

15:18.485 --> 15:20.485
I mean, he's a good guy.
He's lost it.

15:20.487 --> 15:22.320
It's just eating him up.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.956
Just, uh,
hold on a second.

15:26.293 --> 15:28.359
Okay, team, new deal.

15:28.361 --> 15:30.361
Robert Cooper's got
a little brother, Jimmy.

15:30.363 --> 15:33.031
Jimmy got hooked
with the local dealers.

15:33.033 --> 15:35.033
And now, Robert's trying
to track them down.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.267
ED (over headset):
So it's personal.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.002
Yeah, it's starting
to look that way.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.105
Boss, I did a credit card

15:41.107 --> 15:42.273
search on Cooper.

15:42.275 --> 15:43.641
Good work, Spike.
What'd you get?

15:43.643 --> 15:45.276
I got Cooper's address.
He just moved

15:45.278 --> 15:46.511
into a by-the-week
rooming house.

15:46.513 --> 15:48.046
112 McArthur.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.014
Team One, seconds away.
(siren wails)

15:50.016 --> 15:51.449
I'm going
to apologize to Wordy.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.685
He's got a real
connection to this place.

15:53.687 --> 15:56.054
I didn't need to push.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.589
Word of advice for the
rookie from the last one.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.591
When I joined
the team, I made

16:00.593 --> 16:03.127
a lot of mistakes,
I did my share of apologizing,

16:03.129 --> 16:04.595
but the one thing I never had

16:04.597 --> 16:06.331
to apologize for
was speaking my mind.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.499
You see something
you think

16:08.501 --> 16:10.368
affects the call,
like your general impression

16:10.370 --> 16:12.403
of a neighborhood based
on professional experience,

16:12.405 --> 16:13.638
you say it.

16:23.049 --> 16:24.549
What's up?

16:24.551 --> 16:27.118
You tell me.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.252
Uh, I don't know.

16:28.254 --> 16:30.989
You know, busy working.

16:30.991 --> 16:32.256
I'm coming out of my house
this morning

16:32.258 --> 16:33.992
and two high-ranking
security agents

16:33.994 --> 16:36.060
want to take me out for coffee.

16:36.062 --> 16:37.395
Oh, that.

16:37.397 --> 16:38.563
Yeah, that.

16:38.565 --> 16:40.465
They want to talk to me
about you.

16:40.467 --> 16:42.100
It's not
what you think.
No?
No.

16:42.102 --> 16:44.168
Okay.

16:45.638 --> 16:47.572
We'll pick this up later,
all right?

16:56.649 --> 16:59.484
Second floor, end of the hall.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.386
Wordy, you're Alpha with me.

17:01.388 --> 17:03.454
Sam, Leah-- Bravo.

17:03.456 --> 17:05.089
Let's do it.

17:10.330 --> 17:12.063
¶ ¶

17:40.360 --> 17:42.527
Police! Police!
Police!

17:42.529 --> 17:44.395
Police!

17:45.365 --> 17:46.531
Clear.

17:46.533 --> 17:48.699
Boss, Cooper's not here.

17:48.701 --> 17:50.468
PARKER:
Thanks, Eddie.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.771
All right, the
Neighborhood Sentinel

17:53.773 --> 17:55.540
seemed like
they were getting somewhere,

17:55.542 --> 17:57.408
so why would Robert
do something like this?

17:57.410 --> 17:58.876
Things started turning

17:58.877 --> 18:00.343
bad when the family business
burned down.

18:00.346 --> 18:01.679
The hardware store?

18:01.681 --> 18:04.148
When was that?
A few weeks ago.
Bobby was sure

18:04.150 --> 18:06.484
it was the drug dealers
out to get him.

18:06.486 --> 18:07.852
What, because the Sentinel

18:07.853 --> 18:09.219
had closed down
one of their buildings?

18:09.222 --> 18:10.855
Yeah, retaliation.

18:10.857 --> 18:12.857
The family store
meant a lot to him.

18:12.859 --> 18:15.326
But you know, he didn't talk
about his feelings.

18:15.328 --> 18:17.462
But he was taking it
pretty hard.
He hated feeling

18:17.464 --> 18:19.381
helpless.

18:19.382 --> 18:21.299
He became obsessed
with fixing things like his dad.

18:21.301 --> 18:22.800
It was all about fixing things.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.702
But this wasn't
something that he could fix

18:24.704 --> 18:27.138
and he wouldn't talk about it,
not even with Patty.

18:28.174 --> 18:30.541
After a few weeks, he just...

18:31.377 --> 18:33.144
He lost it.

18:34.380 --> 18:35.513
ED:
<i> So he left his wife</i>

18:35.515 --> 18:37.515
moved in here.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.450
Pictures of his family.

18:39.452 --> 18:40.651
That's a good sign.

18:42.555 --> 18:45.356
Used to go to that store
every Halloween.

18:45.358 --> 18:47.558
Old Man Cooper
really went all out.

18:48.728 --> 18:50.461
It's a shame that place is gone.

18:56.903 --> 18:58.803
Boss, I found Cooper's brother.
That's good.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.438
How soon can we get him here?
He's not going anywhere.

19:00.440 --> 19:01.806
Why not?

19:01.808 --> 19:03.174
He's in the morgue.

19:03.176 --> 19:05.810
Jimmy Cooper OD'd
early this morning.

19:14.354 --> 19:15.620
ED:
Who found Jimmy Cooper's body?

19:15.622 --> 19:16.888
SPIKE (over headset):
Dispatch said it was

19:16.890 --> 19:18.422
an anonymous 911 call.

19:18.424 --> 19:19.657
Someone saw him having a seizure

19:19.659 --> 19:21.142
right in the middle
of the street.

19:21.143 --> 19:22.626
WORDY:
At least someone
cared enough to call it in.

19:22.629 --> 19:23.828
Think Cooper knows
his brother died?

19:23.830 --> 19:25.663
If he does, could've
been his trigger.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.899
I'm going to talk
to the paramedics involved.

19:27.901 --> 19:29.367
I guess I go tell Patty.

19:29.369 --> 19:30.601
ED:
Spike, I've got some friends

19:30.603 --> 19:32.120
at Guns and Gangs.

19:32.121 --> 19:33.638
See if you can get some
intel on John Torres.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.373
The middle man, copy.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.708
All right, we find Torres,
maybe we'll find Cooper.

19:37.710 --> 19:40.178
So, Michelangelo,

19:40.180 --> 19:41.612
International Man of Mystery.

19:41.614 --> 19:43.314
He told you.
Yeah.

19:43.316 --> 19:44.615
He's not happy.

19:44.617 --> 19:47.185
He doesn't like to see
the family break up.

19:47.187 --> 19:49.287
Tell me about it.
But he's proud of you.

19:49.289 --> 19:50.655
Really?

19:50.657 --> 19:52.723
Federal agency seeks you out?
That's a big deal.

19:52.725 --> 19:54.458
Yeah?
Yeah.

19:54.460 --> 19:55.693
Yeah.

19:55.695 --> 19:56.961
Thanks, Jules.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.734
So, is this the guy
from last night?

20:05.672 --> 20:07.322
Yeah, that was him.

20:07.323 --> 20:08.973
Came running over when he saw us
working on his brother.

20:08.975 --> 20:10.741
He totally freaked out.

20:10.743 --> 20:12.610
Was the brother still alive
when Cooper got to him?

20:12.612 --> 20:13.711
He was circling
the drain,

20:13.713 --> 20:16.514
but Cooper wouldn't
give up on him.

20:16.516 --> 20:18.583
(defibrillator whirring)
Clear!

20:19.652 --> 20:21.252
Charge to 360.

20:21.254 --> 20:22.753
And clear!

20:23.723 --> 20:25.856
Come on, Jimmy.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.793
Come on, Jimmy,
stay with me.

20:28.795 --> 20:31.829
Stay with me,
buddy, come on.

20:31.831 --> 20:33.531
Come on.

20:33.533 --> 20:34.832
I'm sorry, he's gone.

20:34.834 --> 20:35.933
No, no, he's not.

20:35.935 --> 20:36.968
Keep trying.

20:36.970 --> 20:38.269
I'm sorry.

20:38.271 --> 20:39.770
No!

20:40.740 --> 20:42.740
Come on, Jimmy.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.842
I'm sorry, sir, you
have to let him go.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.677
No! Come on, Jimmy.

20:46.679 --> 20:48.679
Jimmy, Jimmy, please.

20:48.681 --> 20:50.681
No!

20:50.683 --> 20:51.849
No! He's not some junkie!

20:51.851 --> 20:53.017
He's my brother!

20:53.019 --> 20:54.652
It's...
He's my brother!

20:54.654 --> 20:56.420
It's too late.
I'm sorry.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.422
(crying):
No.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.491
Jimmy...

21:02.762 --> 21:04.829
(sobbing)

21:12.505 --> 21:13.871
Thanks, guys.

21:16.676 --> 21:18.342
Seeing your kid brother die
right in front of you.

21:18.344 --> 21:20.394
So, he's upset about
his brother's death,

21:20.395 --> 21:22.445
and he blames it on the people
who sold him drugs.

21:22.448 --> 21:23.981
Guys,
And now he's out for blood.

21:23.983 --> 21:25.983
that middle man Leon mentioned,
John Torres--

21:25.985 --> 21:28.486
his name comes up in connection
with the Steele brothers.

21:28.488 --> 21:30.354
ED: The Steele brothers.
I've heard that name before.

21:30.356 --> 21:31.822
Yeah, real up-and-comers.

21:31.824 --> 21:34.558
They allegedly run the coke
trade this end of town.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.327
PARKER: Why allegedly?
Drug squad's been
building a file.

21:36.329 --> 21:37.795
The Steele brothers,
they come from money.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.463
Mom and Dad disowned them,

21:39.465 --> 21:40.998
but not before Grady
used daddy's money

21:41.000 --> 21:42.767
to buy into the trade big time.

21:42.769 --> 21:45.870
Looks like his kid brother
Drew got into the business, too.

21:45.872 --> 21:47.171
They got money.

21:47.172 --> 21:48.471
Yeah.
They move around.

21:48.474 --> 21:50.374
And the cops have never
been able to touch 'em.

21:50.376 --> 21:51.842
I guess they keep
a pretty low profile.

21:51.844 --> 21:53.711
They're most likely Cooper's
number one target.

21:53.713 --> 21:55.813
So, we'd better find them
before Cooper does.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.548
We got an address
on the Steele brothers?

21:57.550 --> 21:59.050
No last known. Like I said,

21:59.051 --> 22:00.551
they move around,
but what I do have is a lead

22:00.553 --> 22:01.886
on their middle man,
John Torres.

22:01.888 --> 22:03.871
I'm sending you photos.

22:03.872 --> 22:05.855
Torres does business
out of a blue panel van

22:05.858 --> 22:07.925
with spoke rims.

22:07.927 --> 22:09.493
Normally trolls
Perfect mobile office.

22:09.495 --> 22:11.062
the area between
Bloor and Gerrard.

22:11.064 --> 22:12.463
Spike, let's access

22:12.465 --> 22:13.731
city traffic cameras.

22:13.733 --> 22:15.066
Help us narrow down the search.

22:15.068 --> 22:16.600
On it.

22:16.602 --> 22:17.635
ED:
Okay, guys,

22:17.637 --> 22:18.869
let's work the grid. Let's go.

22:18.871 --> 22:19.804
Problem?

22:19.806 --> 22:22.606
No problem.

22:33.419 --> 22:34.785
Anyone have eyes?

22:34.787 --> 22:36.053
Negative.

22:36.055 --> 22:37.955
Still looking.

22:43.529 --> 22:46.063
Wordy, you got something to say,
spit it out.

22:46.065 --> 22:48.432
We protect drug dealers now?

22:48.434 --> 22:49.633
We keep the peace.

22:49.635 --> 22:51.102
If that includes
stopping some guy

22:51.104 --> 22:52.937
from shooting up a bunch
of drug dealers--

22:52.939 --> 22:54.805
then yeah, that's what we do.

22:54.807 --> 22:56.407
WORDY:
Great.

22:56.409 --> 22:57.808
So, when we catch up to him,

22:57.810 --> 22:59.810
and he doesn't share our
feelings about civic order...

22:59.812 --> 23:00.945
We make him listen.

23:00.947 --> 23:02.480
And if he doesn't listen,

23:02.482 --> 23:04.482
and it's down to him
or the drug dealer?

23:04.484 --> 23:06.517
Wordy.
Yeah, Leah?

23:06.519 --> 23:09.820
When bullets start flying, they
don't just hit drug dealers.

23:09.822 --> 23:12.690
ED:
Wordy, we protect everybody.

23:12.692 --> 23:13.958
All right? We protect
the families,

23:13.960 --> 23:15.760
and, yeah, we protect
the dealers.

23:15.762 --> 23:17.111
And we protect Cooper.

23:17.112 --> 23:18.461
I mean, who do you think's
gonna be more familiar

23:18.464 --> 23:19.697
with the use of firearms?

23:19.699 --> 23:21.832
All right, we got three vans

23:21.834 --> 23:23.167
matching the description
in your vicinity.

23:23.169 --> 23:25.035
Someone reported music

23:25.037 --> 23:28.572
blaring from a blue panel van
parked behind Wayne's Tavern.

23:28.574 --> 23:29.907
Uni in the area confirmed

23:29.909 --> 23:31.742
the van had spoke rims.

23:31.744 --> 23:33.677
I'm betting that's our guy.
Team one, move in!

23:34.814 --> 23:36.847
(sirens wailing)

23:45.858 --> 23:47.725
(muffled music blaring)
The cab's empty.

23:47.727 --> 23:49.627
Check the back.
I can't see in.

23:54.200 --> 23:56.467
The door's locked.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.870
Mr. Torres, this is the police.

23:59.872 --> 24:01.806
Please exit your
vehicle.

24:01.808 --> 24:03.974
Can't hear anything
over that music, Eddie.

24:03.976 --> 24:05.743
Wordy, let's go, let's go.

24:11.484 --> 24:12.883
Stack it up.

24:15.221 --> 24:17.054
Police!

24:17.056 --> 24:18.222
¶ ¶

24:18.224 --> 24:21.125
Looks like Cooper beat us here.

24:21.127 --> 24:23.127
(music stops)

24:23.129 --> 24:24.695
(man groans)

24:24.697 --> 24:25.930
He's been shot him
in the stomach.

24:25.932 --> 24:27.898
Winnie, we need an
EMT here immediately.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.066
Copy that.

24:29.068 --> 24:31.302
(panting)

24:31.303 --> 24:33.537
Never thought I'd be so happy
to see the cops.

24:33.539 --> 24:35.673
Did Cooper do this to you?
(groans)

24:35.675 --> 24:36.974
How long ago?
Don't know.

24:36.976 --> 24:39.043
(groans)

24:39.045 --> 24:40.044
Half hour maybe.

24:40.046 --> 24:41.979
Let me guess.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.581
He was looking for
the Steele brothers.

24:43.583 --> 24:44.882
SAM:
Did you tell him
where they're at?

24:44.884 --> 24:46.250
No choice.

24:46.252 --> 24:47.985
What's the address?

24:47.987 --> 24:49.787
(muffled groans)

24:49.789 --> 24:51.722
Mr. Torres, I know you don't
want to give up your bosses,

24:51.724 --> 24:53.190
but unless you tell us
where they are,

24:53.192 --> 24:54.925
Robert Cooper is going
to kill them.

24:54.927 --> 24:58.162
The Steele brothers
can handle Cooper.

24:58.164 --> 24:59.964
He got the drop on you,
didn't he?

24:59.966 --> 25:01.866
The EMTs are here,

25:01.868 --> 25:03.868
but they won't treat you
till we give 'em the all clear.

25:03.870 --> 25:05.936
(groans)

25:08.107 --> 25:11.141
24 Aynes Road.

25:11.143 --> 25:13.143
Aynes. Thank you.

25:13.145 --> 25:15.145
We got an address. Let's go!

25:15.147 --> 25:17.214
Let the EMTs through.

25:19.151 --> 25:22.219
(phone rings)

25:24.156 --> 25:25.689
COOPER:
Patty, it's me.

25:25.691 --> 25:27.408
Oh, Bobby, thank, God.

25:27.409 --> 25:29.126
Are you okay?
Winnie, put a trace on Patty
Cooper's cell phone.

25:29.128 --> 25:31.095
I'm on it.

25:33.065 --> 25:35.065
Listen, I heard about Jimmy.

25:35.067 --> 25:36.534
I am so sorry.

25:36.536 --> 25:38.102
Please, Bobby,
just come home.

25:38.104 --> 25:40.004
Bobby, you're scaring me.
Patty, listen to me...

25:40.006 --> 25:41.972
Please, come home!

25:41.974 --> 25:43.641
There's something
I've got to do.

25:43.643 --> 25:46.043
(crying): Bobby,
It's... it's nearly over.

25:46.045 --> 25:47.244
you're scaring me, okay.

25:47.246 --> 25:48.812
Just come home.

25:48.814 --> 25:51.882
No matter what happens,
I need...

25:54.854 --> 25:57.321
No matter what happens I need
you to know that I love you.

25:57.323 --> 25:58.756
(sobbing)

25:58.758 --> 26:00.090
Where are you?

26:00.092 --> 26:02.126
I'll come get you.

26:02.128 --> 26:03.994
(line disconnects)

26:03.996 --> 26:06.997
Bobby?

26:06.999 --> 26:08.999
Bobby?

26:09.001 --> 26:10.701
He's gone.

26:10.703 --> 26:12.703
Sorry, Jules, I didn't get it.

26:12.705 --> 26:14.638
Sarge, Cooper contacted
his wife.

26:14.640 --> 26:15.673
Get a lock

26:15.675 --> 26:16.707
on his location?

26:16.709 --> 26:18.409
No, it was too quick.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.110
But he said that he needed
to do something,

26:20.112 --> 26:21.912
and that he loves her.

26:21.914 --> 26:25.649
Either way, he knows
it's not going to end well.

26:36.362 --> 26:38.696
What the hell's going on here?

26:38.698 --> 26:39.930
Cops are all over Torres,

26:39.932 --> 26:41.031
and not just regular cops--

26:41.033 --> 26:42.032
SWAT.

26:42.034 --> 26:43.100
Torres is not going to talk.

26:43.102 --> 26:44.234
I don't want to go to jail, man.

26:44.236 --> 26:45.836
No one is going
to jail.

26:45.838 --> 26:47.805
We need to clear the supply
and lay low a while.

26:47.807 --> 26:48.973
Just... just till
the dust settles.

26:48.975 --> 26:50.575
Hey, listen.

26:50.576 --> 26:52.176
The cops are always gonna
be looking after us, Dru.

26:52.178 --> 26:54.244
The trick is not to panic.

26:54.246 --> 26:56.213
When you panic,
you make mistakes.

26:56.215 --> 26:57.815
I don't know, man.
Okay,

26:57.817 --> 26:59.049
this is why...
Come on, Grady.

26:59.051 --> 27:00.918
You freak out over everything.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.453
That's not true.

27:02.454 --> 27:03.987
If you don't have the stomach
for this...
I do.

27:03.990 --> 27:05.656
I swear.
Really?

27:05.658 --> 27:07.057
Yeah.

27:07.059 --> 27:08.926
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

27:08.928 --> 27:10.861
Now put this back
where it belongs.

27:16.168 --> 27:19.069
Hey, I got tickets
to the game tonight.

27:19.071 --> 27:21.739
I don't think
you're gonna make it.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.750
¶ ¶

27:36.122 --> 27:37.988
That's a lot of money
you got there.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.790
Who the hell are you?

27:43.129 --> 27:44.662
You want it?

27:44.664 --> 27:46.030
It's yours.

27:46.032 --> 27:47.097
Just let him go.

27:47.099 --> 27:49.099
You must make a good living.

27:49.101 --> 27:51.001
$50,000,

27:51.003 --> 27:52.136
all yours.

27:52.138 --> 27:53.937
Just let him go
and walk out that door.

27:53.939 --> 27:56.240
Is that all your brother's life
is worth to you, hmm?

27:56.242 --> 27:58.075
50 grand?

27:58.077 --> 27:59.076
I can give you
whatever you want.

27:59.078 --> 28:01.211
Whatever I want, huh?
Name it.

28:04.183 --> 28:06.116
I want my brother back.

28:06.118 --> 28:08.152
You killed him.

28:08.154 --> 28:09.920
You killed Jimmy.

28:09.922 --> 28:11.922
I don't even know
anyone named Jimmy.

28:11.924 --> 28:13.157
He was one of your
best customers.

28:13.159 --> 28:14.692
We don't know
our customers.

28:14.694 --> 28:15.793
You don't know your--

28:15.795 --> 28:17.795
He died early this morning.

28:17.797 --> 28:19.329
Overdose.
Okay, man.

28:19.331 --> 28:21.098
I'm sorry, that's-that's rough.

28:21.100 --> 28:23.767
I tried to help him,
but I couldn't.

28:26.205 --> 28:28.472
Does that seem
right to you?

28:28.474 --> 28:30.841
ED:
<i> Cooper's armed.</i>

28:30.842 --> 28:33.209
We have every reason to believe
the Steele brothers are armed.

28:33.212 --> 28:36.246
We go in aggressive, we could
trigger a firefight.

28:36.248 --> 28:37.448
Can't go in
without intel.

28:37.450 --> 28:39.883
ED:
Wordy, Leah, eyes.
Got it.

28:39.885 --> 28:40.751
Sam...

28:40.753 --> 28:43.220
I'll find a perch.

29:01.774 --> 29:03.841
Transmitting.

29:05.177 --> 29:07.244
Boss, we're good.

29:09.515 --> 29:11.248
All right, he's got them.

29:11.250 --> 29:12.282
Look at him.

29:12.284 --> 29:13.484
His arm's shaking.

29:13.486 --> 29:14.785
He's breathing hard.

29:14.787 --> 29:16.019
He's working up the courage

29:16.021 --> 29:17.921
to kill them.
We're running out of time.

29:17.923 --> 29:19.823
Sam, you have
the solution?

29:19.825 --> 29:21.391
Negative.

29:22.528 --> 29:24.528
Jules, Cooper's got
himself barricaded

29:24.530 --> 29:26.096
inside the house with
the Steele brothers.

29:26.098 --> 29:27.648
Let's bring Patty down here,

29:27.649 --> 29:29.199
maybe she can help us get
through to her husband.

29:29.201 --> 29:30.400
Copy that.

29:30.402 --> 29:32.236
Come with me.
Yeah.
They find Bobby?

29:32.238 --> 29:34.538
I'm going to take you
to him. Come on.

29:34.540 --> 29:36.173
Please don't.

29:36.175 --> 29:37.207
Okay, easy,

29:37.209 --> 29:38.308
easy, easy.

29:38.310 --> 29:40.310
Open that bag of coke

29:40.312 --> 29:42.179
and pour it on the table.

29:42.181 --> 29:44.248
Yeah, no problem.

29:45.918 --> 29:47.951
How much you want?

29:47.953 --> 29:49.253
The whole bag.
Okay.

29:49.255 --> 29:51.555
All right.

29:51.557 --> 29:53.157
SPIKE:
They're breaking out the drugs.

29:53.159 --> 29:54.091
ED:
I didn't think

29:54.093 --> 29:55.325
Cooper was a user.

29:55.327 --> 29:56.393
As far as we know, he isn't.

29:56.395 --> 29:58.796
COOPER:
You know,
my brother

29:58.798 --> 30:01.098
was so high once, he ran right
through a plate glass window.

30:01.100 --> 30:03.333
There was blood everywhere,
but Jimmy-- he didn't even know

30:03.335 --> 30:04.501
he was hurt.

30:04.503 --> 30:06.370
That's what
this stuff did to him.

30:06.372 --> 30:07.404
Do you want me
to cut it for you?

30:07.406 --> 30:08.872
It's not for me.
It's for him.

30:08.874 --> 30:11.041
I don't touch that crap.

30:11.043 --> 30:12.810
Okay, we-we just sell.
We don't use.

30:12.812 --> 30:14.244
Hey, if it's good enough
for my brother,

30:14.246 --> 30:15.879
it's good enough
for yours. Get down.

30:15.881 --> 30:17.047
Okay, okay,
all right, all right.

30:17.049 --> 30:19.049
All right. You want him
to do a line,

30:19.051 --> 30:20.484
that's cool, man.

30:20.486 --> 30:21.852
No, not a line.

30:21.854 --> 30:23.120
All of it.

30:24.089 --> 30:26.089
That'll kill him.

30:26.091 --> 30:27.257
Okay.
No!

30:27.259 --> 30:28.392
Shut up.
Let him go,
man.

30:28.394 --> 30:29.226
Let him go, man.

30:29.228 --> 30:31.261
You let him go!

30:31.263 --> 30:33.931
PARKER (over bullhorn):
Robert Cooper.

30:33.933 --> 30:35.332
This is Sergeant
Gregory Parker

30:35.334 --> 30:37.201
with the Police
Strategic Response Unit.

30:37.203 --> 30:40.237
I need you to put
down your weapon

30:40.239 --> 30:42.539
and exit from the front door
of the house

30:42.541 --> 30:44.107
immediately.

30:44.109 --> 30:46.143
Come on, do it!

30:48.547 --> 30:50.981
Robert Cooper...

30:50.983 --> 30:52.616
There are cops
all around us, man. You're done.

30:52.618 --> 30:54.351
Now, let him go
and give yourself up.

30:54.353 --> 30:55.319
Shut up!

30:55.321 --> 30:57.238
Mr. Cooper,

30:57.239 --> 30:59.156
I need you to stay away
from the front windows.

30:59.158 --> 31:01.058
We'll be breaking the glass
and sending a phone in.

31:01.060 --> 31:02.226
I need you

31:02.228 --> 31:04.228
to pick it up
and talk to me,

31:04.230 --> 31:05.362
all right?

31:05.364 --> 31:07.364
Just a little privacy,
just you and me.

31:23.148 --> 31:25.916
(rhythmic beeping)

31:45.938 --> 31:49.439
(phone ringing)

31:49.441 --> 31:52.075
I think they want you
to answer it.

31:52.077 --> 31:54.645
I said, shut up!
Answer the damn phone!

31:54.647 --> 31:57.214
Well, he's not picking up,
but at least we got ears.

31:57.216 --> 31:59.216
(ringing continues)

31:59.218 --> 32:01.318
GRADY:
Come on, Cooper.

32:01.320 --> 32:04.054
You were gonna shoot us,
you'd have done it by now.

32:04.056 --> 32:05.322
Grady!

32:05.324 --> 32:08.191
We didn't... We didn't
kill your brother, man.

32:08.193 --> 32:09.293
Yes, you did!

32:09.295 --> 32:10.460
He did it to himself.

32:10.462 --> 32:11.628
He's escalating him.

32:11.630 --> 32:13.163
GRADY:
We didn't force him

32:13.165 --> 32:14.164
to take drugs.

32:14.166 --> 32:15.532
That was all on him.

32:15.534 --> 32:17.634
He's trying to distract him,
throw him off his game.

32:17.636 --> 32:19.169
You say you loved your brother.

32:19.171 --> 32:21.471
Why didn't you stop him
from using?

32:21.473 --> 32:23.307
Shut up!
Maybe
an intervention.

32:23.309 --> 32:24.574
You better shut your mouth!

32:24.576 --> 32:26.243
(grunting)

32:26.245 --> 32:27.644
Immediate action--
white door.

32:27.646 --> 32:29.012
Go in now, now!

32:29.014 --> 32:32.115
(grunts)

32:33.385 --> 32:34.318
(yelling, gunfire)

32:34.320 --> 32:36.053
ED:
Everyone, fall back!

32:36.055 --> 32:39.189
(yelling, gunfire)

32:39.191 --> 32:40.424
Fall back! Fall back!
(yelling)

32:44.596 --> 32:47.264
Status? Status!

32:47.266 --> 32:49.366
No harm.

32:50.035 --> 32:53.170
I'm good. Coming to you.

32:53.172 --> 32:54.371
I'm done listening.

32:54.372 --> 32:55.571
We're going in.
Immediate action.

32:55.574 --> 32:57.107
I think he's trying
to force our hand,

32:57.109 --> 32:58.475
get us to storm in
and end this.

32:58.477 --> 32:59.643
Okay, that makes sense.

32:59.645 --> 33:01.011
That makes sense.

33:01.013 --> 33:02.245
He's never shot
to kill before.

33:02.247 --> 33:04.114
WORDY:
He wants us to do it

33:04.116 --> 33:05.082
for him.

33:05.084 --> 33:06.249
PARKER:
No one's dying today.

33:06.251 --> 33:08.318
Sam, what do you got?

33:09.688 --> 33:11.021
Two entrances.

33:11.023 --> 33:12.489
Living room.

33:12.491 --> 33:13.991
Two bedrooms upstairs.

33:13.993 --> 33:15.025
You have a
basement?

33:15.027 --> 33:16.226
Yeah.

33:16.228 --> 33:18.061
Okay, where do
the stairs lead?

33:18.063 --> 33:19.696
Back entrance goes straight
into the basement.

33:19.698 --> 33:21.098
Basement stairs go right up

33:21.100 --> 33:22.599
through the kitchen
into the living room.

33:22.601 --> 33:24.101
Right to the target.

33:24.103 --> 33:25.068
SAM:
Looks like it.

33:25.070 --> 33:26.370
All right.

33:26.372 --> 33:28.638
Let's stack it up.
Watch the windows.

33:56.068 --> 33:58.135
Got it.

33:59.071 --> 34:00.270
ED:
Wordy, you're on point.

34:00.272 --> 34:02.339
Alpha Team, move in.

34:07.279 --> 34:09.713
Don't speak!
Do not speak!

34:09.715 --> 34:10.814
ED:
Robert Cooper.

34:12.251 --> 34:13.383
Shoot him!
ED:
We're not here

34:13.385 --> 34:15.285
to hurt anyone
No, shoot him.

34:15.287 --> 34:16.486
He's gonna kill my brother.

34:16.488 --> 34:17.654
ED:
Nobody's gonna get shot

34:17.656 --> 34:19.189
today, Robert.
COOPER:
Oh.

34:19.191 --> 34:20.490
So now you
show up?

34:20.492 --> 34:22.659
All these years,
begging for your help

34:22.661 --> 34:24.161
while these guys take over.

34:24.163 --> 34:26.129
I hear you, buddy. I hear you.

34:26.131 --> 34:28.398
I just need you
to put that gun down.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.267
They destroyed everything
that my father ever built.

34:30.269 --> 34:32.269
We know what you lost, Robert.

34:36.675 --> 34:38.708
(sighs)

34:38.710 --> 34:40.277
They killed my brother.

34:40.279 --> 34:44.147
I'm going to put my weapon down
so we can talk, okay?

34:44.149 --> 34:46.450
Robert, my name is
Kevin Wordsworth.

34:46.452 --> 34:49.186
My friends call me Wordy.

34:49.188 --> 34:51.354
I loved your dad's store.

34:51.356 --> 34:52.722
What?

34:52.724 --> 34:54.191
Yeah.

34:54.193 --> 34:56.226
Yeah. He-He had a rack

34:56.228 --> 34:58.862
of those old
dime-store westerns.

34:58.864 --> 35:00.330
Nobody ever bought 'em.

35:00.332 --> 35:03.333
Yeah. He let me just
hang out and read 'em.

35:03.335 --> 35:06.369
Never kicked me out
for not buying.

35:08.173 --> 35:09.773
That's the kind of man he was.

35:09.775 --> 35:12.476
What, you think that I don't
know that he was a good man?

35:12.478 --> 35:14.111
He worked his hands to the bone.

35:14.113 --> 35:15.278
And then these

35:15.280 --> 35:18.448
lowlifes-- they
come along, and...

35:20.452 --> 35:23.420
Wordy, we've got Cooper's
wife, Patty, here with us.

35:23.422 --> 35:25.622
She's going
to help us out.

35:25.624 --> 35:27.190
Your wife is here, Robert.

35:27.192 --> 35:29.292
She's real worried about you.

35:29.294 --> 35:31.495
No, no, I have
to do this, all right.

35:31.497 --> 35:33.363
I have to do this
for my brother Jimmy.

35:33.365 --> 35:35.298
Listen, I loved Jimmy,
too, but I know

35:35.300 --> 35:37.267
that he wouldn't want
Bobby to do this.

35:37.269 --> 35:39.336
She's telling me that Jimmy

35:39.338 --> 35:40.804
wouldn't want you
to throw your life away.

35:40.806 --> 35:43.874
There is no life!
There is no life.

35:43.876 --> 35:46.476
They took away anything
that ever mattered to me.
What about Patty?

35:46.478 --> 35:48.845
She's right here
and she loves you.

35:48.847 --> 35:50.780
She's better off without me.

35:50.782 --> 35:53.617
No! That's not true.

35:53.619 --> 35:55.485
We were going
to start a family.

35:55.487 --> 35:57.354
Patty is all about your future.

35:57.356 --> 35:59.289
You were going to have kids.

36:01.260 --> 36:03.560
Robert...

36:03.562 --> 36:06.229
you want to honor
your brother's memory?

36:06.231 --> 36:08.298
Start living again.

36:10.269 --> 36:12.369
No one is better off
without you.

36:12.371 --> 36:13.954
It's not right.

36:13.955 --> 36:15.538
It's not right! They should pay
for what they did.

36:15.541 --> 36:16.740
I know.

36:16.742 --> 36:19.309
Okay, that's why I became a cop

36:19.311 --> 36:20.377
and not a cowboy.

36:23.315 --> 36:25.649
I'll make sure...

36:25.651 --> 36:27.884
I'll make sure they get
what's coming to them.

36:29.721 --> 36:31.788
But not like this.

36:33.192 --> 36:34.824
Look, put the gun down.

36:34.826 --> 36:37.227
Come on, man,
we've got to do this

36:37.229 --> 36:38.962
the right way, Coop.

36:40.332 --> 36:42.332
Put the gun down.

36:42.334 --> 36:45.268
Come on, please.

36:45.270 --> 36:46.703
Let's do this together.

36:46.705 --> 36:49.873
Huh? You and me.

36:51.843 --> 36:53.910
Come on.

36:54.980 --> 36:57.314
Good. All the way down.
All the way down

36:57.316 --> 36:58.415
on the ground.
Drop it. Drop it.

36:58.417 --> 36:59.749
Now, get down on your knees.

36:59.751 --> 37:01.618
That's it. That's it.
Hands behind your head.

37:01.620 --> 37:02.953
Good job.

37:04.923 --> 37:07.424
(breathlessly):
Thank you.

37:07.426 --> 37:08.892
Thank you.

37:24.243 --> 37:27.410
¶ You act like ¶

37:27.412 --> 37:30.313
¶ You wonder ¶

37:30.315 --> 37:33.316
¶ If I know ¶

37:33.318 --> 37:35.452
¶ Right from wrong ¶

37:35.454 --> 37:38.455
¶ Believe me ¶

37:38.457 --> 37:42.025
¶ I understand... ¶

37:45.998 --> 37:48.465
I've been thinking.

37:48.467 --> 37:50.634
You know, it's not like
by the middle of next month

37:50.636 --> 37:52.736
they'll have found all
the international bad guys

37:52.738 --> 37:54.504
and I'll have
missed my chance.

37:55.641 --> 37:56.973
A guy can stay pretty busy

37:56.975 --> 37:58.842
keeping the peace
in his own backyard.

37:58.844 --> 38:00.977
¶ But I am ¶

38:00.979 --> 38:04.381
¶ Who I am ¶

38:06.351 --> 38:10.453
¶ And I am haunted
by the things... ¶

38:10.455 --> 38:12.289
You did good in there.

38:12.291 --> 38:13.757
Thanks.

38:13.759 --> 38:15.392
One good thing came
out of all this.

38:15.394 --> 38:16.826
Cooper kept
them so busy...

38:16.828 --> 38:18.828
Never had time to get
rid of the goods.

38:18.830 --> 38:21.731
Looks like they're
going away for a long time.

38:21.733 --> 38:23.066
So, tonight
at 8:00 or what?

38:23.068 --> 38:25.468
Can I get a rain check
on the barbecue?

38:25.470 --> 38:27.904
I, uh, have some phone calls
I have to make.

38:27.906 --> 38:29.639
No problem.
Yeah?

38:32.344 --> 38:35.345
¶ I get so ¶

38:35.347 --> 38:37.781
¶ Defensive ¶

38:37.783 --> 38:39.749
¶ Because I... ¶
<i> I told them:</i>

38:39.751 --> 38:42.485
Michelangelo Scarlatti,
code name Spike,

38:42.487 --> 38:44.020
is a disgrace to the force.

38:44.022 --> 38:45.955
I mean, he cracks
under pressure.

38:45.957 --> 38:49.025
Can't shoot his way
out of a paper bag.
He can't be trusted

38:49.027 --> 38:50.927
with sensitive information
on a surprise party,

38:50.929 --> 38:53.363
let alone national security.
He can't type

38:53.365 --> 38:55.398
if his life
depended on it.

38:55.400 --> 38:57.500
No, wait.

38:57.502 --> 38:59.336
That's what I<i> wanted</i> to say.

38:59.338 --> 39:01.104
Boss, they were
headhunting<i> me.</i>

39:01.106 --> 39:02.539
Okay, no, it's not like I was...

39:02.541 --> 39:03.840
I mean, you get
to see the world.

39:03.842 --> 39:07.043
International intrigue,
young guy like you. Right?

39:07.045 --> 39:09.779
Just when you make
the choice, Spike,

39:09.781 --> 39:11.514
I will support it.

39:11.516 --> 39:12.982
Okay?

39:12.984 --> 39:14.484
(over headset):
Boss, need you outside.

39:14.486 --> 39:16.553
I'm coming.

39:16.555 --> 39:18.655
<i> Tienimi informato.</i>

39:20.625 --> 39:21.858
Keep you posted, boss.

39:21.860 --> 39:25.795
¶ Smile into the faces
of our enemies ¶

39:25.797 --> 39:30.700

our lives ¶

39:35.774 --> 39:40.043

39:40.045 --> 39:43.780

39:46.752 --> 39:50.153
¶ Hey... ¶

39:54.426 --> 39:55.925
Want to help me out?

39:55.927 --> 39:59.462

39:59.464 --> 40:01.030
¶ That you're saying to me ¶

40:01.032 --> 40:06.403
¶ And I'll try
to defend our lives ¶

40:06.405 --> 40:09.939

40:12.177 --> 40:14.477
