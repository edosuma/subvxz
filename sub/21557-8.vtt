00:03.070 --> 00:05.004
You know, my friends say
I have boundary issues.

00:05.005 --> 00:08.039
I like to think that I'm
just very close to people.

00:08.041 --> 00:11.077
Let's ask my friend Stevie.

00:11.078 --> 00:12.311
Do I have boundary issues?

00:12.312 --> 00:14.046
- Marlon! Get outta here!
- What?

00:14.047 --> 00:15.781
I need your take on this.

00:15.782 --> 00:17.984
Yes, you have boundary issues!

00:17.985 --> 00:20.018
Stevie thinks so.

00:20.019 --> 00:23.588
But you know, he didn't
tell me why he thinks that.

00:23.589 --> 00:24.990
Could you elaborate?

00:24.991 --> 00:26.725
Close the curtain!

00:26.726 --> 00:28.226
I'm just gonna do your back.

00:28.227 --> 00:30.529
Come on, man. This is what friends do.

Come on, guys.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.915
We really gotta get going to the game.

00:48.916 --> 00:50.350
Your father's running late.

00:50.351 --> 00:52.085
Oh, uh, Mom, he's actu...

00:52.086 --> 00:54.153
He really should have
been here an hour ago.

00:54.155 --> 00:55.989
- Mom, he's...
- I know he's gonna

00:55.990 --> 00:59.259
walk in the door any minute
with some silly little excuse.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.427
What the hell?

01:01.428 --> 01:03.730
When did y'all switch
to natural toothpaste?

01:04.864 --> 01:07.033
This tastes like bad breath.

01:07.034 --> 01:09.068
Like, what's the flavor?
[exhales] Haaaah!

01:09.069 --> 01:11.071
Marlon, what are you doing here?

01:11.072 --> 01:12.495
I was getting ready to call your house.

01:12.496 --> 01:14.176
Dad slept over... That's what we were

01:14.177 --> 01:15.942
- trying to tell you.
- Oh, really?

01:15.943 --> 01:17.977
You slept over?

01:19.613 --> 01:20.947
Technically, no.

01:20.948 --> 01:22.715
I mean, we barely slept at all.

01:22.716 --> 01:24.818
[laughs] We had pillow fights.

01:24.819 --> 01:27.020
We ate junk food
at 2:00 in the morning.

01:27.021 --> 01:30.089
And then we recorded you snoring
and put that on YouTube.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.691
[laughing]

01:31.692 --> 01:33.459
Look, Mom, you're trending. Look, Dad!

01:33.460 --> 01:35.128
Oh, wow, look at all those likes!

01:35.129 --> 01:36.863
Uh, time out!

01:36.864 --> 01:38.464
Can you excuse us, kids?

01:38.465 --> 01:40.733
Mommy's gotta talk to Daddy.

01:40.734 --> 01:44.771
But Daddy don't like it when
Mommy has to talk to him.

01:44.772 --> 01:47.407
Marlon, you can't just sleep over here.

01:47.408 --> 01:49.742
What's the big deal?
Zack asked me to stay.

01:49.743 --> 01:51.878
Zack also asked you to shave his head,

01:51.879 --> 01:55.515
and now his fourth-grade picture
looks like a smiling Milk Dud.

01:57.251 --> 02:00.787
The point is, this divorce
is new for all of us.

02:00.788 --> 02:03.456
And I don't wanna send
the kids the wrong message.

02:03.457 --> 02:06.392
Ash, I slept in my clothes
on top of Batman sheets.

02:06.393 --> 02:10.330
Now, if I slept in no clothes
on top of you...

02:10.330 --> 02:13.499
that may be sending the wrong message.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.568
Dad, get dressed. You're
coming to the game, right?

02:15.569 --> 02:17.604
Of course I'm coming
to the game. Come on.

02:17.605 --> 02:19.873
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

02:19.874 --> 02:21.474
Now, listen, win or lose,

02:21.475 --> 02:23.877
I'm still gonna be
the loudest, proudest daddy

02:23.878 --> 02:25.211
up in there. I'ma be like,

02:25.212 --> 02:26.446
"That's my son!

02:26.447 --> 02:28.281
"In your face!

02:28.282 --> 02:30.483
In your face's face!"

02:30.484 --> 02:32.085
I love how loud you are, Dad.

02:32.086 --> 02:33.820
I just wish you could
cheer us to a win.

02:33.821 --> 02:37.790
Son, ain't that much
cheering in the world.

02:37.791 --> 02:40.193
Listen, Coach Doug is terrible.

02:40.194 --> 02:42.896
He's so bad, I wrote a rap about it,

02:42.897 --> 02:44.931
and I'ma do it at halftime.

02:46.634 --> 02:49.068

02:49.069 --> 02:51.704
you could sit with the
adults in the bleachers

02:51.705 --> 02:54.774
and try being a little
bit more subdued.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.509
[calmly] You want subdued?

02:56.510 --> 02:58.144
I'll give you subdued.

02:58.145 --> 02:59.879
Let's go! Let's go!

02:59.880 --> 03:02.782
Let's get this one!
Are you ready to win?

03:02.783 --> 03:04.684
Way to be subdued, Marlon.

03:04.685 --> 03:07.053
Thanks. I been workin' on it.

03:07.054 --> 03:09.789
Let's go, baby! Let's do this!

03:09.790 --> 03:13.893
And <i>that's</i> why I quit track and field.

03:15.429 --> 03:18.865
Oh! Well, look who
finally made it to a game.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.566
Couldn't let another season go by

03:20.567 --> 03:22.101
without supporting Zack.

03:22.102 --> 03:24.470
I have a deep affection
for that little guy.

03:24.471 --> 03:27.607
I told him there's pizza
after every game.

03:27.608 --> 03:31.010
I also have a deep
affection for free pizza.

03:31.011 --> 03:34.047
You have a deep affection for free.

03:35.582 --> 03:37.350
Yvette!

03:37.351 --> 03:39.152
Are you here for free pizza too?

03:39.153 --> 03:41.220
[laughs] Does this body

03:41.221 --> 03:44.123
<i>look</i> like it eats pizza?

03:44.124 --> 03:46.659
I came to see my baby boy ball!

03:48.862 --> 03:52.432
I told <i>her</i> a lot of kids on
the team have divorced dads.

03:52.433 --> 03:54.934
That is not why I'm here.

03:54.935 --> 03:58.404
But where they at, though?

04:01.208 --> 04:03.109
[sighs] Hey, Ashley.

04:03.110 --> 04:04.777
- Hey, Vickie.
- You think the boys

04:04.778 --> 04:06.279
might finally win one?

04:06.280 --> 04:08.581
Well, I don't know,
but Marlon's over there

04:08.582 --> 04:10.984
giving Coach Doug a pep talk right now.

04:10.985 --> 04:13.853
You 'bout to lose this game, Doug.

04:13.854 --> 04:16.956
Now... did you get the
playbook I emailed you?

04:16.957 --> 04:18.124
- No.
- No?

04:18.125 --> 04:19.826
Well, bam!

04:19.827 --> 04:22.562
Wow. Your ex-husband
has a lot of energy.

04:22.563 --> 04:24.864
And <i>that's</i> why I quit violin.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.535
Yeah, well, he can be
a little... unplugged.

04:29.536 --> 04:31.971
But he was up all night

04:31.972 --> 04:33.873
eating sugar with my son and...

04:33.874 --> 04:35.575
Whoa! Whoa, wait.

04:35.576 --> 04:38.411
Your ex-husband sleeps at your house?

04:38.412 --> 04:40.746
Mm... hmm!

04:40.748 --> 04:42.215
No! Not...

04:42.216 --> 04:43.449
really.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.651
I mean, you know, he did last night,

04:45.652 --> 04:47.453
but it was more of like
a slumber party.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.814
You know what, can you just
check my Facebook status?

04:49.815 --> 04:51.657
It's complicated!

04:51.658 --> 04:53.993
Girl, he's still got a key.

04:53.994 --> 04:56.629
My ex was the same way,
and I set boundaries,

04:56.630 --> 04:58.498
and now he respects my space

04:58.499 --> 05:00.366
and we have no problems whatsoever.

05:00.367 --> 05:02.335
I know! Like when Demetrius

05:02.336 --> 05:04.570
got that restraining order against me,

05:04.571 --> 05:08.107
I was like, all you got to do
is call the cops on me twice...

05:08.108 --> 05:10.209
and I'm out!

05:10.210 --> 05:13.146
Crowd: Three, two, one...

05:13.147 --> 05:14.414
[buzzer] [crowd whooping]

05:14.415 --> 05:17.316
Yay! Way to be nice!

05:21.822 --> 05:23.456
Hey, Doug,

05:23.457 --> 05:25.992
I got a defensive suggestion for you.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.127
Yeah... play some.

05:28.128 --> 05:30.063
Marlon, I have to be honest.

05:30.064 --> 05:31.764
You're beginning to frustrate me.

05:31.765 --> 05:34.000
Oh, really? You have
a pretty high tolerance for me,

05:34.001 --> 05:36.702
'cause I've been screaming
in your face for six weeks.

05:36.703 --> 05:38.671
You really think you can
do a better job than me?

05:38.672 --> 05:40.807
Doug, you are 0 and 6.

05:40.808 --> 05:42.642
I can't do no worse!

05:42.643 --> 05:44.744
You win, Marlon.
I can't take any more of this.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.079
You're the coach now.

05:46.080 --> 05:47.747
- Really?
- Yes.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.449
Because if I don't
hand you this whistle,

05:49.450 --> 05:50.883
I'm gonna lose my temper,

05:50.884 --> 05:52.552
my eyes will roll back in my head,

05:52.553 --> 05:55.822
and things will go black.

05:55.823 --> 05:58.524
Oh, oh, calm down, Wreck-It Ralph.

05:59.693 --> 06:03.196
All right, gather around, Camels.

06:03.197 --> 06:04.664
I got some good news.

06:04.665 --> 06:07.934
Coach Doug is out,
and Coach Marlon is in.

06:07.935 --> 06:09.635
Are you ready to win, Camels?

06:09.636 --> 06:10.803
Boys: Yeah!

06:10.804 --> 06:12.271
Then let's go do this!

06:12.272 --> 06:15.208
I will not lead you astray, Camels!

06:15.209 --> 06:17.243
This will not end well.

06:17.244 --> 06:19.479
Eew. That's the ladies' room.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.746
Oh.

06:24.859 --> 06:26.005
Gentlemen...

06:26.006 --> 06:27.760
most teams win games

06:27.761 --> 06:30.230
relying on their fundamentals.

06:30.231 --> 06:32.599
Now... I seen you all play.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.434
We ain't got that luxury.

06:34.435 --> 06:38.671
Assistant Coach Stevie, the board.

06:38.672 --> 06:40.472
If ya wanna win games,

06:40.473 --> 06:44.309
we can't rely on fundamentals.

06:44.310 --> 06:47.279
We gotta take the fun out

06:47.280 --> 06:48.613
and focus on

06:48.615 --> 06:52.184
da... mentals!

06:52.185 --> 06:54.086
The mentals!

06:54.087 --> 06:55.754
What kinda basketball is that?

06:55.755 --> 06:57.556
Street ball, little homey!

07:04.297 --> 07:06.998
Now, first thing we have to do

07:07.000 --> 07:09.067
is we have to up our fouls.

07:09.068 --> 07:10.402
But fouls are illegal.

07:10.403 --> 07:12.104
Only if you get caught.

07:12.105 --> 07:13.305
See,

07:13.306 --> 07:16.275
and the quintessential "sneaky" foul,

07:16.276 --> 07:17.909
is what I like to call

07:17.910 --> 07:19.511
the "Junk Thump."

07:19.512 --> 07:21.146
- [whack]
- Oof!

07:23.082 --> 07:24.383
You see that?

07:24.384 --> 07:26.151
He's debilitated,

07:26.152 --> 07:29.121
and you didn't even see nothin', right?

07:29.122 --> 07:31.723
The Junk Thump.
It's a very simple move.

07:31.724 --> 07:33.421
These two knuckles.
You take 'em like this.

07:33.422 --> 07:34.726
Bow!

07:36.029 --> 07:37.262
[whistle sounds]

07:37.263 --> 07:39.264
Camels, on your feet.

07:40.867 --> 07:42.401
Our second lesson:

07:42.402 --> 07:45.070
Trash talkin'. Trash talkin'.

07:45.071 --> 07:47.739
You have to look your
opponent up and down

07:47.740 --> 07:49.574
and you gotta hit him where it hurts.

07:49.575 --> 07:52.644
You, come here.

07:52.645 --> 07:54.179
You be like, "Your daddy's so poor,

07:54.180 --> 07:57.516
he calls the food stuck
in his teeth leftovers."

07:57.517 --> 08:00.185
Oh! Ho!

08:00.186 --> 08:02.187
My dad manages a hedge fund.

08:02.188 --> 08:04.823
It don't have to be true.
It just gotta hurt.

08:04.824 --> 08:06.558
Now, go sit down, Drake.

08:07.827 --> 08:09.828
I don't know if I can say this stuff.

08:09.829 --> 08:11.997
I go to Temple with some of these guys.

08:11.998 --> 08:14.032
That's good! Let's go with that.

08:14.033 --> 08:16.701
Let's work on our Jewish material.

08:18.471 --> 08:20.939
[whistle blows] All right, next!

08:20.940 --> 08:23.442
Oh!

08:23.443 --> 08:24.676
More knuckle!

08:24.677 --> 08:26.478
What is going on in here?

08:26.479 --> 08:27.946
Oh!

08:27.947 --> 08:29.781
We're just having our first practice.

08:29.782 --> 08:32.851
We have a basketball
court in the driveway.

08:32.852 --> 08:35.386
You can't really get that
sneakers squeak on concrete.

08:35.388 --> 08:37.289
You know, that... [sneakers squeaking]

08:37.289 --> 08:38.323
Hey, stop!

08:38.325 --> 08:39.658
Stop!

08:41.626 --> 08:44.463
May I speak to you in the kitchen?

08:44.464 --> 08:46.298
Get him!

08:48.401 --> 08:50.335
Fill that cheap-ass
Michael Jackson jacket

08:50.336 --> 08:53.104
and beat it!

08:58.978 --> 09:01.012
What's up?

09:01.013 --> 09:04.216
Marlon, I've been thinking
a lot about our divorce lately,

09:04.217 --> 09:07.886
and I believe it's time to
establish some boundaries.

09:07.887 --> 09:10.255
'Bout time!

09:10.256 --> 09:12.924
Boundaries? Why?
We have a cool divorce.

09:12.925 --> 09:15.460
Well, it's about to get less cool!

09:15.461 --> 09:17.095
Uh, 'scuse me, that's enough

09:17.096 --> 09:19.898
from the whole Pinot gallery, okay?

09:19.899 --> 09:21.800
You talk mer-lot!

09:23.836 --> 09:26.938
So why don't you Cabernet
sauvig-the-hell on?

09:31.711 --> 09:33.812
- What's the problem?
- The problem

09:33.813 --> 09:35.947
is I come home from work

09:35.948 --> 09:39.017
and I find ten Camels in my living room

09:39.018 --> 09:41.720
smacking Stevie in the genitals.

09:43.823 --> 09:45.991
Marlon, I'd like my key back.

09:45.992 --> 09:48.426
Ashley, are you serious?

09:52.098 --> 09:54.599
Okay, fine.

09:54.600 --> 09:56.468
It's cool.

09:56.469 --> 09:57.569
Take 'em.

09:57.570 --> 09:59.104
That's how you wanna play,

09:59.105 --> 10:00.805
I'm cool with that.

10:00.807 --> 10:01.940
Stevie!

10:02.909 --> 10:04.910
Let's get outta here.

10:04.911 --> 10:06.511
Hmph!

10:29.702 --> 10:31.570
Camels!

10:31.571 --> 10:32.804
We out!

10:39.011 --> 10:40.712
And just for the record,

10:40.713 --> 10:43.415
if you had junk,
I woulda made them thump it.

Boundaries!

10:49.288 --> 10:51.156
Talkin' boundaries!

10:51.157 --> 10:55.227
You know, I thought us not doing
it was boundaries enough.

10:55.228 --> 10:57.963
I don't get it. We had a cool divorce.

10:57.964 --> 11:00.232
And now she wants to mess things up.

11:00.233 --> 11:02.033
Can you believe this?

11:02.034 --> 11:04.302
Ashley has a valid point.

11:04.303 --> 11:07.506
Anytime somebody comes in and
they take advantage of you,

11:07.507 --> 11:08.874
violate your privacy,

11:08.875 --> 11:11.343
have no respect for
your personal space,

11:11.344 --> 11:13.745
it can be very frustrating.

11:13.746 --> 11:16.948

11:16.949 --> 11:19.451
Let me rephrase that.

11:21.921 --> 11:23.722
All right, Camels!

11:23.723 --> 11:26.024
[blowing whistle]

11:27.860 --> 11:29.894
All right, Camels,
I know what you're thinking.

11:29.896 --> 11:31.663
Damn, Coach looks good in a suit.

11:31.664 --> 11:35.166
And I do.

11:35.167 --> 11:37.102
Do you know why I'm wearing this suit?

11:37.103 --> 11:38.937
Not just because I got a good discount,

11:38.938 --> 11:41.640
three for one over at the outlet.

11:41.641 --> 11:44.910
I'm wearing this suit because
if you dress like a winner,

11:44.911 --> 11:46.611
then you feel like a winner,

11:46.612 --> 11:47.946
and if you feel like a winner,

11:47.947 --> 11:49.814
then you <i>are</i> a winner!

11:49.815 --> 11:52.484
Now, are you ready, Camels?

11:52.485 --> 11:53.785
Boys: Yeah!

11:53.786 --> 11:55.687
On three! One, two, three!

11:55.688 --> 11:57.822
Boys: Yo' mama's ugly!

11:57.823 --> 11:59.691
Yes! Now let's go out there

11:59.692 --> 12:01.793
and show 'em that we're winners!

12:01.794 --> 12:03.628
Crowd: Two, one...

12:03.629 --> 12:05.964
[buzzer] [crowd cheering]

12:05.965 --> 12:08.600
I feel like such a loser.

12:08.601 --> 12:11.503
Loser? It's only halftime.

12:11.504 --> 12:14.573
And y'all didn't play hard
enough to break a sweat.

12:14.574 --> 12:17.242
Lookit, this boy is dry as hell.

12:17.243 --> 12:20.879
You could go to church after this.

12:20.880 --> 12:22.113
Dad!

12:22.114 --> 12:24.115
We're down by 20 points!

12:24.116 --> 12:25.784
We can see where this is going.

12:27.486 --> 12:29.788
Coach, I don't think we're cut out

12:29.789 --> 12:31.590
for this type of basketball.

12:31.591 --> 12:34.359
And Gabe is really beating himself up

12:34.360 --> 12:37.329
over some of the things
he's saying out there.

12:37.330 --> 12:40.665
I'm ashamed of myself!

12:40.666 --> 12:45.537
Gabe, you stop it with all
your little white guilt.

12:45.538 --> 12:46.938
We can win this.

12:46.939 --> 12:48.232
If you guys just go out there

12:48.233 --> 12:50.248
and you play the street ball
that I been teaching you,

12:50.249 --> 12:53.518
I guarantee you,
I will coach you to victory.

12:53.519 --> 12:57.121
You couldn't coach
a black man into a rib joint!

12:58.123 --> 13:01.926
Gabe, I am both very hurt...

13:01.927 --> 13:04.262
yet proud...

13:04.263 --> 13:05.430
of you for that.

13:05.431 --> 13:07.331
Like, I wanna punch you

13:07.332 --> 13:10.902
and hug you at the same time.

13:10.903 --> 13:13.044
You know, what I want you to do?
I want you to bottle that

13:13.045 --> 13:15.339
and save it for the court, okay?

13:15.340 --> 13:17.008
Sorry, Coach.

13:17.009 --> 13:20.244
I think you pushed us too far.

13:22.614 --> 13:24.282
Hey,

13:24.283 --> 13:26.217
Zack...

13:26.218 --> 13:27.819
you too?

13:27.820 --> 13:29.220
Sorry, Dad.

13:29.221 --> 13:31.689
It's just not us.

Girl, and when she got home,

13:50.554 --> 13:52.055
he had wrecked her floors.

13:52.056 --> 13:53.577
- [gasps]
- So you know what she did?

13:53.578 --> 13:55.058
She took away his key.

13:55.059 --> 13:56.426
Mm-hmm-hmm!

13:56.427 --> 13:58.228
That is such a great first step.

13:58.229 --> 14:01.398
You are on your way
to a perfect divorce.

14:01.399 --> 14:03.900
Ashley, are you listening to this?

14:03.901 --> 14:06.001
You know what, the team's
been gone a long time.

14:06.002 --> 14:08.637
Something's going on.
I'm gonna go talk to Marlon.

14:08.638 --> 14:10.472
You don't have to talk to him.

14:10.473 --> 14:14.009
I haven't spoken to my
ex-husband in three years,

14:14.010 --> 14:16.211
trust me.

14:18.281 --> 14:20.482
Why don't you talk to him?

14:20.483 --> 14:22.651
Why would I need to?

14:22.652 --> 14:25.154
When you drop off the kids?

14:25.155 --> 14:27.656
I pull into a parking lot.
I flash my lights twice.

14:27.657 --> 14:30.192
They get out of my car, they
hop into his, and that's it.

14:30.193 --> 14:32.261
That is how you do divorce.

14:32.262 --> 14:35.631
That is also how you do a drug deal.

14:35.632 --> 14:37.333
What's wrong with you?

14:37.334 --> 14:39.168
You know what, I've heard enough.

14:39.169 --> 14:41.870
I'm gonna go and speak to Marlon.

14:41.871 --> 14:43.950
Yeah, you go do that,
and I'm gonna stay here

14:43.951 --> 14:46.075
and chop it up with "El Chapo."

14:52.849 --> 14:54.717
Everything okay, Coach?

14:54.718 --> 14:56.385
Hmm. I'd tell you,

14:56.386 --> 14:59.221
but I don't wanna violate
your boundaries.

14:59.222 --> 15:00.923
Where's the team, Marlon?

15:00.924 --> 15:02.524
- Them little bastards quit.
- What?

15:02.525 --> 15:04.326
Nobody's talking to me.

15:04.327 --> 15:06.929
Gabe done lost his mind.

15:06.930 --> 15:08.521
I got all these little white
kids running around here

15:08.522 --> 15:09.652
talking about people's mamas.

15:09.653 --> 15:11.066
And little black kids too.

15:11.067 --> 15:12.414
Zack's about to get popped.

15:12.415 --> 15:14.736
He said some outrageous
stuff out there.

15:16.806 --> 15:19.575
All right. I'll admit...

15:19.576 --> 15:20.776
I got boundary issues.

15:23.046 --> 15:25.747
I just push people until
they kick me to the curb.

15:29.586 --> 15:31.387
Okay.

15:31.388 --> 15:33.055
Yes, you're right.

15:33.056 --> 15:34.890
Your lack of boundaries
is one of the reasons

15:34.891 --> 15:36.458
our marriage didn't work.

15:36.459 --> 15:38.394
And I got scared it would be a reason

15:38.395 --> 15:40.262
that our divorce wouldn't work.

15:40.263 --> 15:43.399
But Marlon, your biggest weakness...

15:43.400 --> 15:45.634
is also your strength.

15:45.635 --> 15:47.536
So you know what?

15:47.537 --> 15:50.072
Use that strength.

15:50.073 --> 15:51.707
Give Zack the win.

15:53.443 --> 15:55.444
You know...

15:55.445 --> 15:58.747
sometimes I wonder why
I ever divorced you.

15:59.649 --> 16:02.451
[laughing]

16:02.452 --> 16:04.553
Oh, don't get it twisted, Negro.

16:04.554 --> 16:06.422
I divorced <i>you.</i>

16:06.423 --> 16:08.457
Okay, well, let's just
agree to disagree.

16:08.458 --> 16:10.192
- Okay.
- 'Cause them kids

16:10.193 --> 16:12.421
been missing for 20 minutes,
and I got a sneaking suspicion

16:12.422 --> 16:14.596
that lunatic Gabe is keying my car.

16:14.597 --> 16:16.398
Oh, God.

16:19.235 --> 16:22.438
All right, Camels, gather around.

16:22.439 --> 16:25.074
Tanner, you were right.

16:25.075 --> 16:26.575
I pushed you guys too far.

16:26.576 --> 16:29.111
I-I tend to go overboard.

16:29.112 --> 16:31.280
That's my weakness.

16:31.281 --> 16:33.315
But, see, when I played basketball,

16:33.316 --> 16:35.651
I made that my strength.

16:35.652 --> 16:37.586
I'd take things too far.

16:37.587 --> 16:40.689
There's nothing I wouldn't do to win!

16:40.690 --> 16:43.092
And you guys have to
take your weaknesses

16:43.093 --> 16:44.793
and you have to turn
them into strengths.

16:44.794 --> 16:47.663
Come here, light skin.

16:47.664 --> 16:49.498
You... you're a three-point threat.

16:49.499 --> 16:51.300
I can't shoot three-pointers.

16:51.301 --> 16:53.469
You damn sure can't.
I didn't say you could.

16:53.470 --> 16:55.637
I said you're a three-point
threat... you know why?

16:55.638 --> 16:57.539
'Cause those players,
they're gonna look at you

16:57.540 --> 17:00.976
and go, "Hey, look at little
Steph Curry baby.

17:00.977 --> 17:02.678
"I bet you that eggshell
colored brother

17:02.679 --> 17:05.114
can shoot three-pointers."

17:05.115 --> 17:07.648
And that's what you do,
you use that to your advantage.

17:07.650 --> 17:09.451
You fake the three-pointer,
you dribble in,

17:09.452 --> 17:10.786
you take a two-pointer.

17:10.787 --> 17:12.688
You gonna be hitting
those all day long,

17:12.689 --> 17:14.690
open shots. You got me?

17:14.691 --> 17:16.157
You. Come here, Gabe.

17:16.159 --> 17:17.826
What's your weakness?

17:17.827 --> 17:20.162
I'm just a nerd.

17:20.163 --> 17:22.164
Yes, you are.

But you know what? So is Jeremy Lin.

17:24.334 --> 17:26.868
NBA ball player.
You know he graduated Harvard

17:26.869 --> 17:29.671
with a degree in math and science?

17:29.672 --> 17:31.507
So while all the brothers is playing

17:31.508 --> 17:33.242
athletic basketball on him,

17:33.243 --> 17:35.344
oh, he's doing mathematic equations.

17:35.345 --> 17:37.679
He's like, "I cross over
using the Pythagorean theorem,

17:37.680 --> 17:39.715
A square plus B square equals C square,

17:39.716 --> 17:41.383
and I spin around the defender

17:41.384 --> 17:43.285
with the circumference of radius of Pi.

17:43.286 --> 17:45.554
And I shoot a protracted

52 rotations per second,

17:48.525 --> 17:49.691
and swish!

all of you guys have strengths,

I guarantee you,

18:04.374 --> 18:05.641
you're gonna go out there

18:05.642 --> 18:07.276
and you're gonna win this game, okay?

My key.

Okay, so here's the deal.

You ain't got that. Watch out, shorty.

20:05.612 --> 20:09.014
- Look at that, look at that!
- Just stop poking...

20:09.015 --> 20:10.349
You know what?

20:10.350 --> 20:11.583
I don't want the key back

20:11.584 --> 20:14.052
because I made
a stupid basketball shot.

20:14.053 --> 20:16.421
I only want the key back

20:16.422 --> 20:19.024
if you want me to have it back.

20:29.269 --> 20:31.170
Thank God...

20:31.171 --> 20:34.173
'Cause I didn't think I
could make it from here.

20:34.174 --> 20:37.142
Oh, I know, Coach.

20:37.143 --> 20:39.344
So...

20:39.345 --> 20:42.414
we back to having a cool divorce?

20:42.415 --> 20:45.150
Let's try the...

20:45.151 --> 20:47.419
almost cool divorce.

20:48.488 --> 20:51.256
I'm almost cool with that.

20:57.997 --> 20:59.431
Hey, Zack,

20:59.432 --> 21:02.100
you can close your bedroom window.

21:02.101 --> 21:05.437
Mommy gave me the key back.

21:05.438 --> 21:09.458
