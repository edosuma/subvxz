WEBVTT

00:34.541 --> 00:36.791
- Mr. Tillerson.

00:38.541 --> 00:40.375
We found something.

00:40.458 --> 00:45.166
and I jump...

00:45.250 --> 00:47.416
That's a rock.

00:49.833 --> 00:52.875
- Look...

00:52.958 --> 00:55.833
it must be him...

00:55.916 --> 00:58.000
Where'd you find this?

00:58.083 --> 00:59.833
A mile or so out...

01:00.916 --> 01:04.625
...near the Abbotts'
west pasture.

01:04.750 --> 01:06.500
- Have you seen it before?

01:07.958 --> 01:09.291
Once...

01:11.166 --> 01:13.208
as a kid...

01:20.583 --> 01:23.208
You find any more of this...

01:23.291 --> 01:26.958
...I want you to
bring it right to me.

01:27.041 --> 01:30.625
- Understand?

01:30.708 --> 01:33.916
- Leave it there.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.750
- Get outta here.

02:41.375 --> 02:43.291
- Matt?

02:43.375 --> 02:45.000
Yeah. I'm here.

02:45.083 --> 02:46.958
Did you take Trevor's
belt buckle out of my desk?

02:47.041 --> 02:49.625
No. Why? Is it missing?

02:49.708 --> 02:52.541
Um... let me ask you.

02:52.625 --> 02:54.291
How long you think
Royal was hanging around

02:54.375 --> 02:56.000
- my office last night?
- I don't know.

02:56.083 --> 02:57.750
Ten minutes. Wait.

02:57.833 --> 02:59.750
You think he took it?

03:01.291 --> 03:03.375
You know, you probably...

03:03.458 --> 03:05.291
shouldn't leave evidence...

03:05.375 --> 03:07.625
I know that, Matt! I know that!

03:44.291 --> 03:46.541
Gate back there was
pretty busted.

03:47.791 --> 03:49.833
That the one Luke drove through?

03:49.916 --> 03:52.250
Yeah, I ought to send him
a bill.

03:54.375 --> 03:56.708
Maybe wait
until after the funeral.

03:57.708 --> 04:00.000
"The Big Rock Candy Mountain"]

04:48.416 --> 04:51.083
The way you brought us,
is that the only way up?

04:51.166 --> 04:53.375
It's the only way I know.

04:53.458 --> 04:55.208
Rigor mortis
come and gone,

04:55.291 --> 04:56.791
so he's probably
been here awhile.

04:56.875 --> 04:59.458
No stink though.

04:59.541 --> 05:01.875
It's a serious shot
to the throat.

05:01.958 --> 05:04.625
Animal maybe?

05:04.708 --> 05:07.333
Grizzly, maybe a mountain lion?

05:07.416 --> 05:10.000
No, he'd a been breakfast.

05:11.333 --> 05:13.583
Maybe he fell?

05:13.666 --> 05:15.166
Onto his throat?

05:15.250 --> 05:16.791
And from where?

05:16.875 --> 05:18.625
Well...

05:18.708 --> 05:20.250
no sign of Trevor,

05:20.333 --> 05:23.291
or... anyone else
coming from anywhere.

05:23.375 --> 05:25.666
Royal, this your land,
where we are now?

05:25.750 --> 05:27.666
No. It's BLM.

05:27.750 --> 05:30.625
Our property ends at the tree
line, down by the trailhead.

05:37.083 --> 05:39.083
So what do you think?

05:42.458 --> 05:45.416
I think we got
some figuring out to do, Royal.

05:55.125 --> 05:56.500
Where's Rhett?

05:56.583 --> 05:58.500
Oh, in town at Taylor's.
Running an errand.

05:58.583 --> 06:00.083
Oh.

06:04.166 --> 06:06.375
Okay.

06:08.583 --> 06:10.875
Bet you didn't think
you'd be a hero today, huh?

06:13.041 --> 06:15.041
Well, you are one in my book.

06:16.083 --> 06:17.458
Now...

06:17.541 --> 06:19.291
I just have to...

06:19.375 --> 06:22.208
ask you a few things,
make sure we got all the info

06:22.291 --> 06:24.375
- we need-- I'm good.
- Sorry, did you want coffee?

06:24.458 --> 06:26.166
I just made a pot
and we also got-- didn't you...?

06:26.250 --> 06:27.791
- What did you make?
- Banana bread-- you want

06:27.875 --> 06:29.166
- some banana bread?
- Yeah, you want
some banana bread?

06:29.250 --> 06:30.666
I'm allergic to bananas.

06:31.708 --> 06:33.750
You're allergic to bananas?

06:33.833 --> 06:35.750
- Yeah.
- What happens if you eat one?

06:35.833 --> 06:37.291
Anaphylactic shock.

06:38.750 --> 06:40.083
Huh.

06:40.166 --> 06:42.375
So, Amy.

06:42.458 --> 06:44.458
You were on your hike,
found Trevor,

06:44.541 --> 06:47.000
ran home, told your grandpa,
your grandpa called me.

06:47.083 --> 06:48.208
Do I got that right?

06:48.291 --> 06:49.958
Yeah, I guess so.

06:50.041 --> 06:51.666
When's the last time
you hiked that trail?

06:51.750 --> 06:53.500
Um...

06:53.583 --> 06:55.791
- a few days ago.
- She walks it all the time...

06:55.875 --> 06:59.416
Sorry, Per, if you don't mind I,
I just have to hear it from her.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.750
Did you...

07:01.833 --> 07:03.750
notice anything
out of the ordinary

07:03.833 --> 07:05.083
when you were up there last?

07:05.166 --> 07:06.375
What do you mean, like what?

07:06.458 --> 07:09.000
Tracks. People.

07:09.083 --> 07:10.375
Trash.

07:10.458 --> 07:12.291
Are those "out of the ordinary"?

07:13.625 --> 07:15.291
Sorry.

07:15.375 --> 07:17.458
No.

07:17.541 --> 07:20.000
I didn't see anything.

07:22.500 --> 07:25.083
Let me ask you this then.

07:25.166 --> 07:27.291
Do you remember a few nights ago

07:27.375 --> 07:30.291
when Luke and Billy Tillerson
came by?

07:31.791 --> 07:33.333
Yeah.

07:34.375 --> 07:37.041
Did you see... Luke and Billy?

07:37.125 --> 07:39.541
They were being weird.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.375
They were drunk.

07:41.458 --> 07:42.791
Yeah.

07:44.708 --> 07:46.583
And, um...

07:46.666 --> 07:48.708
who else was at the house then,
you remember?

07:48.791 --> 07:51.500
Uh... my dad.

07:51.583 --> 07:55.541
And my grandma was asleep, but
then she came down to get me.

07:55.625 --> 07:58.208
Was your grandpa here, too?

08:07.000 --> 08:08.416
Yeah.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.541
He was in bed. It was late.

08:10.625 --> 08:12.416
Asleep?

08:12.500 --> 08:14.833
Yeah, I'm pretty much dead
at30.

08:14.916 --> 08:18.000
- Man could sleep
through a tornado.

08:22.958 --> 08:24.791
What about your Uncle Rhett?

08:24.875 --> 08:26.791
Was he here?

08:30.750 --> 08:32.166
No.

08:33.666 --> 08:35.250
No, he wasn't here.

08:35.291 --> 08:37.833
Do you know where he was?

08:37.916 --> 08:40.083
No.

08:40.166 --> 08:42.583
I don't know where he was.

08:53.791 --> 08:55.625
Okay.

08:58.041 --> 09:00.250
Well, thanks so much.

09:01.666 --> 09:04.500
I'll tell you, Amy, I think you
could probably convince your dad

09:04.583 --> 09:06.583
to let you skip chores today,
do something fun.

09:06.666 --> 09:09.041
Can we watch
a movie with Grandma?

09:09.125 --> 09:11.291
- Fine by me.
- Sure, honey.

09:19.875 --> 09:22.166
Hey, um, you know...

09:22.250 --> 09:25.083
I didn't want to...

09:25.166 --> 09:28.208
say it with Amy around,
but, um...

09:30.000 --> 09:32.416
...Rhett was with a girl
that night.

09:32.500 --> 09:35.041
Oh. Do you know who?

09:35.125 --> 09:37.916
Uh... no.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.291
I don't know.

09:40.375 --> 09:42.583
Okay.

09:42.666 --> 09:44.708
- All right.

09:44.791 --> 09:46.958
Well, good to know.

09:48.250 --> 09:50.083
Does he know about the body?

09:50.166 --> 09:51.333
Why?

09:51.416 --> 09:52.750
Just wondering.

09:52.833 --> 09:55.000
We haven't been able
to reach him.

09:56.875 --> 09:58.916
Royal, you mind
walking to my truck?

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
No, sure thing.

10:11.708 --> 10:13.583
Well, thanks for calling it in.

10:13.666 --> 10:15.375
Yeah, why wouldn't I?

10:15.458 --> 10:17.583
Right.

10:17.666 --> 10:19.833
You know,
funniest thing happened.

10:19.916 --> 10:22.041
We got 12 different calls
from folks saying

10:22.125 --> 10:24.416
they saw that mountain right
there disappear in plain sight.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.333
No, you serious?

10:26.416 --> 10:28.666
- Crazy, right?
- Yeah.

10:28.750 --> 10:30.583
Reminded me of when there were
all those folks talking

10:30.666 --> 10:33.875
about a flying saucer up
in Montana, you remember that?

10:33.958 --> 10:35.625
No.

10:38.750 --> 10:41.250
You take anything
out of my office?

10:41.333 --> 10:43.250
What?

10:43.333 --> 10:45.625
Did you take something
from my office?

10:45.708 --> 10:47.708
- When, last night?
- Last night.

10:47.791 --> 10:50.458
No.

10:51.750 --> 10:54.083
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.

10:54.166 --> 10:56.833
Why, you missing something?

10:56.916 --> 10:58.958
Yeah.

11:01.500 --> 11:03.333
Oh.

11:05.541 --> 11:08.125
Well, I hope you find it.

11:08.208 --> 11:10.041
Okay.

11:10.125 --> 11:12.666
I'll be seeing you, Royal.

11:12.750 --> 11:14.750
Yep.

11:19.583 --> 11:22.041
Matt, you there?

11:22.125 --> 11:23.458
- Found Rhett.
- I need you

11:23.541 --> 11:25.416
to go ask him what he did
after the fight with Trevor.

11:25.500 --> 11:27.041
But look, this is important:
don't let him

11:27.125 --> 11:28.500
answer his phone, okay?

11:28.583 --> 11:31.125
He doesn't know about the body.

11:34.375 --> 11:36.291
- Call your brother.
- I'm on it.

12:15.166 --> 12:18.041
Choose enter.

12:18.125 --> 12:20.125
Cancel.

12:20.208 --> 12:21.958
Cancel again.

12:23.666 --> 12:26.208
And that's how you
open an account.

13:05.750 --> 13:07.750
Hey, Rhett!

13:11.416 --> 13:13.208
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:13.291 --> 13:15.500
Wow. Hey, you two.

13:15.583 --> 13:16.833
Rhett, can we chat?

13:18.000 --> 13:19.250
Uh...

13:22.041 --> 13:23.833
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

13:23.916 --> 13:25.083
I, uh...

13:25.166 --> 13:27.041
Matt, hold on a sec.
My brother's been trying...

13:27.125 --> 13:28.958
Rhett, I'm gonna ask that you
don't answer that telephone.

13:29.041 --> 13:30.333
- What? Why?
- What's going on?

13:30.416 --> 13:31.541
Talk to me for one sec.

13:31.625 --> 13:33.000
Don't answer that phone,
all right?

13:33.083 --> 13:34.583
- The guy can use his phone.
- No, I got this. It's fine.

13:34.666 --> 13:36.208
- Matt...
- I just got to ask him
one thing.

13:36.291 --> 13:37.333
I'm sorry, my brother's
been trying to get me...

13:37.416 --> 13:39.166
Where'd you go after the
fight with Trevor?

13:39.250 --> 13:42.416
What? Why?

13:42.500 --> 13:45.500
Where were you
after the fight with Trevor?

13:45.583 --> 13:46.875
Don't answer that phone.

13:51.250 --> 13:53.333
I'm sorry, I got to...

13:53.416 --> 13:55.750
- Hey.
- They found Trevor.

13:55.833 --> 13:57.125
- Rhett.
- You got to tell them

13:57.208 --> 13:58.958
you were with a girl that night.

13:59.041 --> 14:00.583
Rhett?

14:00.666 --> 14:03.166
Rhett, I'm not
gonna ask you again.

14:03.250 --> 14:07.708
Where'd you go after you got
into a fight with Trevor?

14:11.166 --> 14:13.333
I was with a girl.

14:13.416 --> 14:15.041
You were with a girl?

14:15.125 --> 14:16.666
Yeah.

14:17.875 --> 14:19.708
Who were you with?

14:22.166 --> 14:23.250
Rhett?

14:24.583 --> 14:26.500
He was with me.

14:28.833 --> 14:31.291
Rhett, is that true?

14:33.500 --> 14:34.750
Yeah.

14:37.958 --> 14:39.166
All right.

14:41.166 --> 14:43.208
Well, thanks.

14:43.291 --> 14:45.291
That's all I had for you.

14:48.833 --> 14:50.833
You're on
the clock here, honey.

15:26.500 --> 15:27.583
Billy!

15:31.458 --> 15:33.833
Please, can you quit it?

15:34.833 --> 15:37.375
Sorry.

15:37.458 --> 15:39.041
"Angel of the Morning"]

15:41.041 --> 15:42.875
I made an extra sandwich.

15:44.875 --> 15:46.791
It's for you.

15:58.416 --> 16:02.458
can't bind your heart...

16:04.458 --> 16:06.791
What?

17:06.250 --> 17:08.500
Jesus Christ.

17:08.583 --> 17:10.416
You scared me.

17:12.916 --> 17:15.375
Why are you out here?

17:15.458 --> 17:17.583
I was looking for you.

17:23.250 --> 17:26.666
They found a body
on the hillside there.

17:26.750 --> 17:28.750
Our neighbor.

17:30.375 --> 17:32.250
God.

17:33.583 --> 17:35.291
Do you know anything about that?

17:36.958 --> 17:38.333
No.

17:39.791 --> 17:41.541
You sure?

17:42.875 --> 17:44.708
Yeah.

17:45.958 --> 17:48.625
Is that hillside west pasture?

17:48.708 --> 17:50.708
Why?

17:50.791 --> 17:52.666
My camp's west pasture.

17:52.750 --> 17:54.125
It is.

17:54.208 --> 17:56.333
Okay.

17:58.333 --> 18:00.708
Is there anything
you need from us?

18:02.125 --> 18:05.166
How about a picture
of your wife?

18:07.208 --> 18:09.541
What?

18:09.625 --> 18:11.166
Well, I've been
all around this area.

18:11.250 --> 18:14.125
Maybe I've seen her.

18:14.208 --> 18:16.208
Stranger things happen.

18:52.541 --> 18:54.291
Hello?

18:54.375 --> 18:56.333
Hi, Todd.

18:57.416 --> 18:59.250
Sorry, today is a bad day to...

19:01.250 --> 19:03.208
Why that soon?

19:03.291 --> 19:05.125
All right.

19:05.208 --> 19:06.875
I'll see what I can do.

19:06.958 --> 19:09.208
- Okay. Bye.

19:13.375 --> 19:15.208
I'm gonna grab a drink.
You want something?

19:27.375 --> 19:29.666
What was that? About Trevor?

19:29.750 --> 19:33.500
No. Lawyer calling about
the Tillerson land situation.

19:37.291 --> 19:38.791
You doing all right?

19:42.833 --> 19:45.166
He didn't have to call
that in right away.

19:45.250 --> 19:48.166
Yes, he absolutely did.

19:48.250 --> 19:49.666
What else would you have him do?

19:49.750 --> 19:50.875
You want to explain
to your daughter

19:50.958 --> 19:52.333
why her family
isn't reporting...

19:52.416 --> 19:53.916
Why the hell did he put
the body up there

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
in the first place?

19:55.083 --> 19:57.291
He said he didn't.

19:57.375 --> 19:59.500
Then how'd it get there?

20:11.958 --> 20:14.500
County assessor set
the west pasture hearing

20:14.583 --> 20:17.541
for the end of the month.

20:17.625 --> 20:20.750
Yeah, well, that can't happen.

20:20.833 --> 20:22.791
So what do you want to do?

20:22.875 --> 20:24.750
I'll pay him a visit.

20:32.541 --> 20:36.125
If, uh, you didn't do it,

20:36.208 --> 20:38.500
then how did that body
get up there?

20:38.583 --> 20:42.208
Trust me, I wish I knew.

20:42.291 --> 20:44.541
You think that girl had
something to do with it?

20:44.625 --> 20:48.416
I mean, she saw you
that night, right?

20:48.500 --> 20:49.625
It'd have to be her.

20:49.708 --> 20:52.083
Yeah, I don't, I don't think so.

20:52.166 --> 20:54.000
Why not?

20:57.500 --> 21:00.375
- Royal.
- What?

21:02.125 --> 21:04.083
Please don't make me
draw this out of you.

21:04.166 --> 21:06.791
I'm-I'm tired of pushing you.

21:06.875 --> 21:09.541
I can't tell you
what I don't know, Ceci.

21:11.500 --> 21:13.125
This-this is not
the same kind of quiet

21:13.208 --> 21:15.208
that I've put up with
for 30 years.

21:15.291 --> 21:19.125
Okay, you have no idea what
I did for our boys that night.

21:19.208 --> 21:21.250
I'm not talking about that.
T-This is different.

21:21.333 --> 21:23.416
This is something more.

21:23.500 --> 21:25.750
I see it. The boys see it.

21:25.833 --> 21:27.750
Okay, there's a lot
I can't explain.

21:27.833 --> 21:30.000
- Well, try!
- I am trying.

21:30.083 --> 21:31.958
That's all I do, is try!

21:32.041 --> 21:34.375
And if you'd just trust me...

21:34.458 --> 21:38.166
I have stood by you
at every turn!

21:38.250 --> 21:41.041
Every single injury,
every drought, every fire,

21:41.125 --> 21:45.000
every time you fucking
couldn't pay the goddamn bills.

21:45.083 --> 21:46.958
Through Rebecca. Through this.

21:47.041 --> 21:50.250
And-and, holy shit,
we made it, we stuck together,

21:50.333 --> 21:51.708
because we had to.

21:51.791 --> 21:53.416
And all a sudden,
you're telling me

21:53.500 --> 21:55.000
you want to go it alone?

21:55.083 --> 21:57.333
Do you know
what that feels like?

23:39.416 --> 23:40.666
- Thank you.
- Yep.

23:45.166 --> 23:48.375
Hi, Maria. You got a minute?

23:48.458 --> 23:50.958
Sure. I'm on a break in ten.

23:51.041 --> 23:53.250
How about you take
your break now?

23:54.458 --> 23:56.000
How long you been
working at the bank?

23:56.083 --> 23:58.250
A few weeks.

23:58.333 --> 24:01.583
- You like it?
- It's all right.

24:05.708 --> 24:08.291
You were with Rhett
the night Trevor disappeared,

24:08.375 --> 24:09.500
is that right?

24:09.583 --> 24:11.291
Yeah.

24:11.375 --> 24:12.541
You go to school with Rhett?

24:12.625 --> 24:14.833
- High school.
- High school.

24:16.041 --> 24:17.625
So did Rhett drive you home
that night?

24:19.458 --> 24:21.083
Yeah.

24:21.166 --> 24:22.958
What time was that?

24:23.041 --> 24:25.083
- 00,- 30.

24:25.166 --> 24:27.125
Great.

24:28.208 --> 24:30.000
Great.

24:30.083 --> 24:33.125
Now, if I call your parents,
can they confirm that?

24:34.666 --> 24:36.541
Well, they were asleep
when I got home,

24:36.625 --> 24:39.458
so I doubt they can.

24:41.791 --> 24:45.375
Maria, Trevor Tillerson
was found this morning

24:45.458 --> 24:47.458
near the Abbotts' ranch.

24:50.750 --> 24:52.041
He's dead.

24:53.916 --> 24:58.416
Look, it's completely normal
to want to protect a friend.

24:58.500 --> 25:01.750
But this is likely a homicide.

25:01.833 --> 25:06.000
And believe me when I tell you,
the best thing for anyone to do

25:06.083 --> 25:09.375
when being questioned
in conjunction with a homicide

25:09.458 --> 25:11.958
is to tell the truth.

25:12.041 --> 25:13.750
'Cause when you don't
tell the truth,

25:13.833 --> 25:19.416
even for what can seem
like the right reasons, well,

25:19.500 --> 25:23.000
there are really bad
consequences.

25:23.083 --> 25:25.208
Not nine times out of ten.

25:25.291 --> 25:28.625
Ten times out of ten.

25:28.708 --> 25:31.458
You understand
what I'm telling you?

25:33.333 --> 25:34.750
Yeah.

25:36.500 --> 25:37.916
So...

25:39.916 --> 25:42.541
...was there anyone else
behind the bar

25:42.625 --> 25:44.958
when Rhett and Trevor
got in the fight?

26:27.791 --> 26:28.958
Hello?

27:00.166 --> 27:01.916
Let's start with

27:02.000 --> 27:03.708
what happened after
the fight with Trevor.

27:03.791 --> 27:05.791
I grabbed Perry and we left.

27:05.875 --> 27:08.291
Did you drive home
in your truck or Rhett's truck?

27:08.375 --> 27:10.291
Rhett's.

27:10.375 --> 27:13.708
He dropped me off,
and I guess he went back out.

27:14.916 --> 27:16.625
You know where?

27:16.708 --> 27:18.875
To see Maria, I think.

27:18.958 --> 27:20.666
To see Maria, yeah.

27:20.750 --> 27:22.625
And what'd you and Maria do?

27:22.708 --> 27:25.500
Look, I don't really remember...

27:25.583 --> 27:28.166
Maria confessed to me
that she lied.

27:28.250 --> 27:30.166
That you guys didn't go
back out that night.

27:31.875 --> 27:33.750
Do you know why
she would lie about that?

27:33.833 --> 27:36.416
I-I don't know
why she'd lie to you.

27:36.500 --> 27:38.083
Ask Rhett.

27:38.166 --> 27:40.125
- Ask Rhett what?
- What happened.

27:40.208 --> 27:41.750
- He told me what happened.

27:44.041 --> 27:45.666
Is there something you're not
telling me about Perry?

27:47.750 --> 27:49.291
What about your dad?

27:50.541 --> 27:52.791
Do you think your dad's
hiding something from me?

27:56.833 --> 27:59.833
If you weren't with Maria,
then where were you?

27:59.916 --> 28:01.541
With Perry?

28:01.625 --> 28:04.125
I know he's your brother,
but be smart.

28:04.208 --> 28:05.458
Think about that rodeo career.

28:05.541 --> 28:07.500
Look...

28:07.583 --> 28:09.666
I assume Rhett
was telling me the truth.

28:09.750 --> 28:12.750
Maria said the last person
she saw in that parking lot

28:12.833 --> 28:14.791
was you.

28:14.875 --> 28:18.416
Perry, you and I been
through a lot.

28:18.500 --> 28:20.208
Last thing I want to do
is drag you and your family

28:20.291 --> 28:21.625
through another tragedy.

28:21.708 --> 28:24.666
Especially Amy.
This is important, okay?

28:24.750 --> 28:29.208
Do you know where Rhett went
after you got home?

28:38.083 --> 28:41.708
No. I don't know.

28:43.125 --> 28:45.083
You told Matt
you were with a girl.

28:45.166 --> 28:46.500
Yes.

28:46.583 --> 28:48.416
But you weren't,
so where were you?

28:48.500 --> 28:51.125
Maria says she doesn't know.

28:51.208 --> 28:52.875
Your brother says
he doesn't know.

28:52.958 --> 28:54.958
That's what Perry said?

28:55.041 --> 28:57.375
He verified exactly
what Maria told me.

28:57.458 --> 28:59.375
Nobody knows where you were

28:59.458 --> 29:01.333
for two very important hours,
Rhett.

29:01.416 --> 29:03.125
Your brother's blood

29:03.208 --> 29:06.083
was on Trevor's belt buckle,
not yours.

29:06.166 --> 29:10.416
Perry was the last one
seen with Trevor, not you.

29:10.500 --> 29:13.250
So I'll ask you one last time.

29:14.291 --> 29:17.750
Is there something you want
to tell me about your brother?

29:29.625 --> 29:32.708
All right, boys!
Let's get you home.

29:36.166 --> 29:38.916
- What happened?
- We're okay.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.541
- What the fuck
did you say about me?
- What?

29:41.625 --> 29:44.333
- Nothing. Why?
- Rhett, let's do this at home.

29:45.958 --> 29:48.583
Think twice before
you throw me under the bus, Per.

29:48.666 --> 29:50.083
All right?

29:54.458 --> 29:56.000
I swear to God,
if you're throwing this

29:56.083 --> 29:58.708
- towards your brother...
- Course I'm not. I'm...

29:58.791 --> 30:01.125
What am I supposed to do?

30:01.208 --> 30:02.583
Dad, you want me to go
back in there and confess?

30:02.666 --> 30:04.708
I want you to keep
your fucking mouth shut.

30:04.791 --> 30:10.458
I want you to buck up
and be smart for once.

30:10.541 --> 30:13.333
Goddamn it.

30:21.833 --> 30:23.833
What do you need me to do?

30:26.583 --> 30:28.208
I don't know.

30:30.500 --> 30:32.791
Turn back time?

31:46.375 --> 31:47.791
Billy.

31:49.166 --> 31:51.541
How could you not push them
to investigate sooner?

31:51.625 --> 31:52.958
I'd like to mourn my son

31:53.041 --> 31:54.541
without you breaking
my balls, Patricia.

31:54.625 --> 31:56.166
Wayne, he was missing
for five days.

31:56.250 --> 31:58.500
Well, if you cared so much,
you should've stuck around.

31:58.583 --> 32:00.375
Oh, please, don't you dare.

32:00.458 --> 32:03.708
You're the one who wouldn't
let me take them with me.

32:03.791 --> 32:07.500
Because this is their home.

32:07.583 --> 32:10.708
Wyoming is their home.

32:10.791 --> 32:12.708
Not Aspen.

32:13.750 --> 32:14.750
Wyoming!

32:15.750 --> 32:17.166
Wyoming!

32:21.166 --> 32:22.583
Jesus.

32:24.708 --> 32:26.291
Oh...

32:28.875 --> 32:30.875
Fuck.

32:34.041 --> 32:35.875
Have you thought
about a funeral?

32:35.958 --> 32:37.375
Something small.
I don't want to be speaking

32:37.458 --> 32:38.916
to a bunch of glad-handers.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.833
Luke thinks the Abbott boys
killed him.

32:41.916 --> 32:43.791
You think that's true?

32:45.500 --> 32:48.166
They're hiding something.

32:48.250 --> 32:49.708
Always have.

32:49.791 --> 32:51.458
Something about Trevor?

32:53.458 --> 32:55.208
About the land.

32:56.250 --> 32:57.416
It'll be mine.

32:58.875 --> 33:02.458
County assessor's
got it covered.

33:02.541 --> 33:04.416
Oh, my God,

33:04.500 --> 33:07.083
if this is that west pasture
nonsense Luke told me about...

33:07.166 --> 33:09.708
- It's not nonsense,
it's valuable.

33:09.791 --> 33:12.625
And if you're still concerned
with your lousy 10% stake...

33:12.708 --> 33:14.250
'Cause you are
certi-fucking-fiably insane.

33:14.333 --> 33:15.958
No! Do us all a favor,
cut the superstitious bullshit!

33:16.041 --> 33:18.750
I got news for you,
there's more, there's more,

33:18.833 --> 33:20.750
there's more than money

33:20.833 --> 33:23.000
at play here, toots.

33:23.083 --> 33:25.833
Going after a few lousy acres
is a waste of everyone's time.

33:25.916 --> 33:27.125
Stop!

33:33.125 --> 33:35.125
Pick up that rock.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
What is it?

33:52.083 --> 33:55.083
That, Patty...

33:57.083 --> 34:01.791
...is what we've all
been looking for.

34:03.416 --> 34:06.666
What do you mean? It's valuable?

34:47.666 --> 34:49.333
There's something out there.

34:52.125 --> 34:53.750
All right.

34:55.750 --> 34:58.166
You know what?

34:58.250 --> 35:01.875
Here's how this is gonna work.

35:01.958 --> 35:04.916
I'm gonna plan this funeral,

35:05.000 --> 35:08.583
and then I'm gonna find out
who murdered my son.

35:08.666 --> 35:10.958
And then I'm gonna make sure
Luke saves this ranch

35:11.041 --> 35:14.083
while you slowly lose
your mind and die.

35:20.666 --> 35:22.291
It's good to have a list.

35:27.916 --> 35:30.125
Still got a fine nutcracker,
Patty.

35:40.375 --> 35:42.500
- Yeah?

35:42.583 --> 35:43.708
Hi, there. Karl Cleaver?

35:43.791 --> 35:45.125
Yeah, our lawyer mentioned

35:45.208 --> 35:46.666
that you chatted about
the Tillerson dispute.

35:46.750 --> 35:48.166
I was already in town,
so I thought I'd just...

35:48.250 --> 35:50.125
Oh, right, right, right,
come on in, Roy-boy.

35:50.208 --> 35:51.541
- Thank you.

35:51.625 --> 35:54.166
How's the first few months been?

35:54.250 --> 35:55.916
- Shelley's not riding you
too hard, is he?
- Ha!

35:56.000 --> 35:57.583
Old Softy Shelley?

35:57.666 --> 35:59.958
Man's as weak as a whisker.

36:00.041 --> 36:03.083
So, what can I do you for?

36:03.166 --> 36:04.250
Well, I was hoping
we could clear up

36:04.333 --> 36:06.083
this west pasture issue.

36:06.166 --> 36:08.666
You know, that land's belonged
to my family for over...

36:08.750 --> 36:10.541
Well, the hearing will be
at the end of the month.

36:11.583 --> 36:14.041
We'll just have to see
how it goes.

36:14.125 --> 36:16.041
Mm-hmm.

36:16.125 --> 36:19.500
Karl, you and I both know
that that claim's not legit.

36:19.583 --> 36:22.375
- The Tillersons...
- Hearing will be
end of the month.

36:26.875 --> 36:28.875
Huh.

36:28.958 --> 36:31.666
So, I heard you had
quite some commotion

36:31.750 --> 36:33.500
up at the ranch there.

36:33.583 --> 36:35.500
Angry neighbors, dead bodies.

36:38.125 --> 36:39.458
Where you from, Karl?

36:39.541 --> 36:41.041
Texas, born and bred.

36:43.041 --> 36:44.125
What you think of Wyoming?

36:44.208 --> 36:46.416
Well, I'll tell you...

36:48.083 --> 36:49.708
I don't know why you folks

36:49.791 --> 36:51.416
put up with all the oddities
coming through here.

36:51.500 --> 36:55.208
Y'all got buffalo and immigrants
and Indians running around.

36:55.291 --> 36:57.750
Heck, somebody told me
that, um--

36:57.833 --> 36:59.583
was it-- Kanye West
and Kimmie Kardashian,

36:59.666 --> 37:01.541
they're buying up whole towns.

37:01.625 --> 37:03.291
Yeah, well, live and let live.

37:03.375 --> 37:05.416
You know, we stay out
of people's business around here

37:05.500 --> 37:06.833
if you catch my drift,
which is why...

37:06.916 --> 37:08.458
Hell in a handbasket,
you ask me.

37:08.541 --> 37:11.458
Why I wanted to chat
about this west pasture.

37:17.958 --> 37:20.666
Put down the Fritos, pal.

37:20.750 --> 37:22.750
Now you listen to me,
you slack-jawed tub of guts,

37:22.833 --> 37:24.791
I know the Tillersons
are paying you off,

37:24.875 --> 37:26.583
but hear me when I say
my west pasture

37:26.666 --> 37:28.666
is my west pasture, and if you
don't call off that hearing,

37:28.750 --> 37:31.708
I might just have to show you
a nice big hole in the earth

37:31.791 --> 37:33.875
that you do not want
to be acquainted with.

37:33.958 --> 37:36.833
'Cause guess what you're not
gonna find in that hole, Karl.

37:38.791 --> 37:41.875
- Fritos?
- There are no Fritos
in that hole, Karl.

37:41.958 --> 37:44.125
So munch up while you can,
big boy,

37:44.208 --> 37:45.500
'cause I got plans for you.

37:51.791 --> 37:53.833
Shelley. Nice hat.

38:00.958 --> 38:03.333
- Joy, this is Trevor's...
- Oh, no, we know each other.

38:03.416 --> 38:04.958
From when you started.

38:05.041 --> 38:06.250
Under Burt.

38:07.250 --> 38:09.083
I'm glad you finally made it.

38:10.208 --> 38:11.833
Welcome back.

38:12.833 --> 38:15.333
I'm sorry for your loss.

38:16.666 --> 38:18.583
I know this can't be easy.

38:18.666 --> 38:21.083
It'll be a lot easier
when you all make an arrest.

38:25.333 --> 38:28.000
Well, why don't I, um,
get started?

38:29.500 --> 38:31.583
I don't blame you
for being frustrated.

38:31.666 --> 38:33.041
We're doing our best.

38:33.125 --> 38:35.125
I know that.

38:35.208 --> 38:38.583
No, we're all just
so eager to move on.

38:38.666 --> 38:42.500
I had Gary speed things up here
so we could bury Trevor Friday.

38:42.583 --> 38:43.916
I hope you'll come.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.250
Hell, you might even snag
a few votes.

38:49.416 --> 38:50.666
I'm sorry.

38:50.750 --> 38:53.166
Gary, you've been so patient.

38:57.208 --> 38:58.541
All right, well...

38:58.625 --> 39:00.416
Hold on, Ms. Tillerson,
you can't be in here

39:00.500 --> 39:02.416
for the coroner's report,
it's against the law.

39:02.500 --> 39:04.500
Well, can you make an exception?

39:04.583 --> 39:06.500
I'd really rather be here.

39:06.583 --> 39:08.625
Why is that?

39:08.708 --> 39:13.000
It took five days
to find my son's body,

39:13.083 --> 39:16.625
four days for your office
to even show any concern,

39:16.708 --> 39:18.375
and you've never
handled a murder,

39:18.458 --> 39:21.041
so I don't actually trust
that you know what you're doing.

39:21.125 --> 39:24.041
There's a lot of folks
around here that feel the same.

39:24.125 --> 39:27.000
They're all pretty reticent
to vote for someone like you,

39:27.083 --> 39:30.458
and after all this, well,
I can't say I blame them.

39:30.541 --> 39:32.208
If you want to win that
election, you'd do well

39:32.291 --> 39:34.875
to remember who it is you serve.

39:36.500 --> 39:39.000
I serve the people
of Amelia County.

39:39.083 --> 39:41.791
And I do that by upholding
the law, and like I said...

39:43.666 --> 39:45.291
Well.

39:50.875 --> 39:52.291
Please be quick.

40:05.666 --> 40:07.958
Died from blunt force trauma
to his windpipe.

40:08.041 --> 40:11.041
The big question we ran into
is how come it's so clean?

40:11.125 --> 40:14.083
- Clean how?
- Aside for some
metal lacerations

40:14.166 --> 40:17.000
on his torso, there's no
residue, no drag marks, nothing.

40:17.083 --> 40:19.791
For showing up on a mountain,
that's what I'd call an anomaly.

40:19.875 --> 40:22.166
But here's the hardest part:

40:22.250 --> 40:25.541
He was dead less than ten hours
from when he was found.

40:25.625 --> 40:27.041
Are you sure?

40:27.125 --> 40:29.916
Ran it three times.
Surprised us, too.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.666
When was he last seen?

40:32.750 --> 40:34.416
Eight days ago.

41:47.375 --> 41:51.041
A time to mourn
and a time to dance.

41:51.125 --> 41:53.083
A time to scatter stones

41:53.166 --> 41:55.375
and a time
to gather stones together.

41:55.458 --> 41:58.708
A time to embrace
and a time to...

42:04.416 --> 42:05.916
Nobody told you to stop.

42:10.916 --> 42:13.458
...and a time to refrain
from embracing.

42:13.541 --> 42:17.583
A time to get
and a time to lose.

42:17.666 --> 42:22.166
A time to keep
and a time to cast away.

42:22.250 --> 42:26.125
A time to rend
and a time to sow.

42:26.208 --> 42:31.083
A time to keep silence
and a time to speak.

42:31.166 --> 42:33.000
It was Perry.

42:42.125 --> 42:44.333
Beautiful singing.

42:47.958 --> 42:49.708
Who are you?

42:49.791 --> 42:52.083
I'm Autumn.

42:54.583 --> 42:56.125
Where's Rose?

42:56.208 --> 42:58.750
Playing with Matt.

42:58.833 --> 43:01.125
Pretty ballsy showing up here.

43:01.208 --> 43:03.708
Maybe they're telling the truth?

43:03.791 --> 43:07.791
Either that or Royal Abbott
is a damn good con man.

43:21.708 --> 43:23.791
Thank you
so much for coming.

43:23.875 --> 43:26.416
I know, it is tragic.

43:47.083 --> 43:49.375
Hey, can we talk?

43:49.458 --> 43:51.458
I never should have let you say
that you were with me.

43:51.541 --> 43:54.125
I-I froze. I'm sorry.

43:54.208 --> 43:56.125
Maria, this isn't me.

43:56.208 --> 43:58.833
- I promise.
- Look, I like you.

43:58.916 --> 44:00.916
But whatever you're wrapped up
in with your family,

44:01.000 --> 44:02.333
I don't want any part of it.

44:02.416 --> 44:04.416
I'm sorry, I just can't.

44:28.875 --> 44:31.000
Quite a service.

44:31.083 --> 44:34.500
Yeah, quite a family.

44:34.583 --> 44:37.666
You find what you were
looking for?

44:37.750 --> 44:40.000
No, actually.

44:40.083 --> 44:41.833
Mm.

44:41.916 --> 44:45.416
Well, retrace your steps.

44:45.500 --> 44:47.250
That's just the thing.

44:47.333 --> 44:50.666
It doesn't feel like
there's any steps to retrace.

44:50.750 --> 44:53.500
Everything's just kind of
disappearing.

44:53.583 --> 44:55.791
- Hmm.
- You know?

44:55.875 --> 44:59.125
Yeah, it's a crazy world.

44:59.208 --> 45:02.708
Strange times. What can you do?

45:04.125 --> 45:07.500
Same as I've always done.

45:07.583 --> 45:11.083
- Be patient, keep looking.
- Mm.

45:11.166 --> 45:14.083
Something will show up.

45:14.166 --> 45:16.333
World is not that crazy.

45:21.916 --> 45:25.291
You ever wonder if the world's
not what you think it is?

45:30.083 --> 45:32.375
What are you talking about?

45:34.500 --> 45:39.166
No law, no order.

45:39.250 --> 45:42.583
Just chaos all the way down.

45:45.250 --> 45:47.166
Heck, look around.

45:48.250 --> 45:50.416
We just put a man
into the earth,

45:50.500 --> 45:53.291
and it's all folks can do
but drink themselves silly...

45:54.708 --> 45:57.250
...fending off the dark.

45:59.791 --> 46:02.375
Fending off the end.

46:09.833 --> 46:11.583
I'm gonna hit the jakes.

46:26.416 --> 46:30.208
Mrs. Abbott? Karl P. Cleaver,
county assessor.

46:30.291 --> 46:32.416
Your husband paid me
a visit this week.

46:32.500 --> 46:34.541
Yes, well, I've been meaning
to pay you a visit myself.

46:34.625 --> 46:37.166
No need. Your hearing's
been moved up to next week.

46:37.250 --> 46:39.208
What? Why?

46:39.291 --> 46:41.833
You tell your husband
I don't take well to threats.

46:41.916 --> 46:43.041
Right.

46:43.125 --> 46:45.583
You much prefer bribes,
don't you?

46:45.666 --> 46:47.875
You got some sauce
on your tie, Karl.

46:55.875 --> 46:57.583
Read 'em
and weep, boys.

47:00.333 --> 47:02.375
- Goddamn.
- Yeah!

47:02.458 --> 47:04.458
"State Trooper"]

47:33.625 --> 47:34.958
a clear conscience...

47:35.041 --> 47:37.166
You cheat these guys
out of their paychecks?

47:38.791 --> 47:40.541
Oh, hey, Royal.

47:40.625 --> 47:42.208
Hey, yourself.

47:46.375 --> 47:48.708
Mind if I sit down?

47:50.291 --> 47:51.791
Sure.

47:54.791 --> 47:57.625
How about five-card?

48:01.875 --> 48:03.083
I'll deal.

48:07.750 --> 48:10.083
What's your ante? Ten? 20?

48:10.166 --> 48:12.500
- Oh, it's whatever you...
- Let's do 20.

48:13.875 --> 48:15.708
Feeling lucky or something?

48:15.791 --> 48:18.166
I'm feeling something.

48:27.708 --> 48:32.416
Before we start, though,
you mind showing me your feet?

48:33.458 --> 48:35.583
- What?
- Your feet.

48:35.666 --> 48:38.458
You got to show me your feet.
It's a custom around here.

48:39.666 --> 48:41.208
What the fuck
are you talking about?

48:41.291 --> 48:45.583
Well, while back,
some guys were playing cards.

48:45.666 --> 48:48.791
They were sitting at a table
just like this,

48:48.875 --> 48:50.416
in a place not too far
from here,

48:50.500 --> 48:52.916
in some dark
kind of night and...

48:54.000 --> 48:55.291
...bang.

48:55.375 --> 48:57.333
What-something comes
knocking through the door

48:57.416 --> 48:59.541
was a tall pale man
in a long coat,

48:59.625 --> 49:01.541
says he wants to play.

49:01.625 --> 49:03.166
Tall pale man
sits down at the table,

49:03.250 --> 49:04.791
and they get
into a couple three-hands

49:04.875 --> 49:07.666
and one of them drops
a card on the floor.

49:07.750 --> 49:10.833
Guy grabs a lantern,

49:10.916 --> 49:13.166
goes to pick it up, shines
the lantern under the table

49:13.250 --> 49:14.791
and you know what he sees?

49:16.875 --> 49:20.625
The pale man's feet are hooves.

49:20.708 --> 49:23.333
They knew right then they
were playing with the devil.

49:25.375 --> 49:26.708
He grabbed the card,
looked back up.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.083
Devil was gone.

49:45.625 --> 49:48.291
You're the tall pale one, buddy.

49:48.375 --> 49:50.333
Why don't you show me yours?

49:52.000 --> 49:55.083
Nah, I'm square.

49:55.166 --> 49:56.791
You thirsty?

49:56.875 --> 49:57.916
You look like you need a beer.

49:58.000 --> 49:59.250
Yeah, I want a beer. Yeah.

49:59.333 --> 50:00.416
Can we get a couple of beers?

50:00.500 --> 50:02.250
- And a whiskey.
- Christ.

50:02.333 --> 50:05.500
You're like a walking cliché,
Royal.

50:05.583 --> 50:07.875
You want a pack
of Marlboros, too?

50:07.958 --> 50:12.166
Aw, you're still angry,
aren't you?

50:12.250 --> 50:15.208
I thought we said all that
was water under the bridge.

50:15.291 --> 50:17.708
Everyone, Royal Abbott is angry

50:17.791 --> 50:19.708
because I pushed him
into a goddamn hole.

50:21.458 --> 50:25.750
Now, ain't that some
schoolyard shit?

50:28.916 --> 50:30.041
I'm sorry...

50:30.125 --> 50:31.458
Let's play.

50:49.125 --> 50:51.541
What are we playing for?

50:53.791 --> 50:56.166
How about you let me stay
on your land forever?

50:58.625 --> 51:00.125
What?

51:00.208 --> 51:02.375
All right.

51:02.458 --> 51:05.083
I lose, you get to stay
as long as you want.

51:06.791 --> 51:09.458
You lose, I get the whole story

51:09.541 --> 51:11.833
behind that rock
around your neck.

51:15.166 --> 51:17.166
Fine.

51:43.583 --> 51:45.208
You want to up it?

51:46.583 --> 51:48.916
Yeah, I want to up it.

51:50.875 --> 51:52.791
How about the thing itself?

51:54.916 --> 51:56.958
I want that doodad
around your neck.

52:00.041 --> 52:02.250
What do you want
with my necklace?

52:02.333 --> 52:05.500
Well, I'm guessing same as you.

52:05.583 --> 52:09.041
Maybe it's like
you've been saying.

52:09.125 --> 52:11.625
Something's been happening
around here.

52:14.458 --> 52:17.208
Something more than we can know.

52:20.625 --> 52:23.833
So what do you say?

53:03.583 --> 53:05.000
I tell you what.

53:09.458 --> 53:11.250
You put up that rock
around your neck

53:11.333 --> 53:13.125
and I'll put up my west pasture.

53:14.416 --> 53:16.458
- What?
- You heard me.

53:18.333 --> 53:20.791
Your entire west pasture?

53:20.875 --> 53:23.333
All 1,200 acres.

53:25.333 --> 53:27.000
Are you serious?

53:27.083 --> 53:30.750
You wager that rock...

53:30.833 --> 53:35.750
and I'll put up all that land
you seem to be so fond of.

53:46.791 --> 53:48.166
All right.

53:49.208 --> 53:50.333
All right.

55:10.833 --> 55:12.791
Gunsmoke
starring James Arness

55:12.875 --> 55:15.166
as Matt Dillon.

55:33.791 --> 55:35.666
Oh, goddamn it!

55:37.166 --> 55:39.125
Hey!

56:19.375 --> 56:22.083
Come on, motherfucker,
show me something!

56:24.833 --> 56:26.458
I'm gonna find you.

56:29.916 --> 56:31.833
Come on, motherfucker!

56:31.916 --> 56:34.125
Show me something!

56:49.208 --> 56:50.833
Oh, me, oh, my.

56:52.833 --> 56:54.625
Who could you be?

57:00.208 --> 57:01.791
I got you. No!

57:01.875 --> 57:03.916
Where you headed?
No, do not!
