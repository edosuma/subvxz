WEBVTT

01:54.906 --> 01:57.200
Your flesh is mortal,

01:57.283 --> 02:02.831
and in the end, all mortal flesh must die.

02:23.184 --> 02:24.519
Ms. Wardwell!

02:24.602 --> 02:27.480
I'm so sorry, I didn't mean
to startle you. It's just I...

02:28.273 --> 02:31.609
It's just I saw you fleeing
Principal Hawthorne's office, and...

02:32.235 --> 02:35.280
Oh, that man, that man,
that man, that man.

02:36.322 --> 02:38.783
Did he say something
just hideous to you?

02:38.867 --> 02:42.120
-He-- He-- Um--
-Want me to call your aunts?

02:42.203 --> 02:44.330
See if they can come pick you up,
take you home?

02:44.414 --> 02:47.500
No. No. No, no, I'm fine.
I just got light-headed, is all.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.294
Thank you, Ms. Wardwell.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.687
Here's a question, Aunties.

03:07.979 --> 03:11.232
How can one witch get
another witch's familiar to talk?

03:11.316 --> 03:14.569
You're not allowed a familiar,
per the rules of your house arrest.

03:14.652 --> 03:17.697
I found it perched
on the Kemper boy's casket.

03:18.281 --> 03:22.452
I thought if I could get it to speak,
maybe I could find out how Connor died.

03:22.535 --> 03:26.539
You won't be able to.
Familiars are bound to their witches.

03:26.623 --> 03:27.790
It'll be dead soon.

03:27.874 --> 03:31.127
The greatest agony it can know
is a life without its master.

03:31.753 --> 03:34.672
Give it here. I'll make it quick.
Hilda can fashion it into a purse.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.841
-No, it's mine. For now.
-Yeah.

03:36.925 --> 03:40.303
I'll, uh, try bribing it with some food,
see if that works.

03:42.347 --> 03:44.265
Would you like a little tomato?

03:56.486 --> 03:58.613
Hey, you okay?

03:59.656 --> 04:01.074
You're, like, a million miles away.

04:01.157 --> 04:06.704
Yeah. Sorry, I'm fine. I was just having
an out-of-body experience, but I'm back.

04:07.872 --> 04:09.791
Great! There you guys are.

04:09.874 --> 04:13.503
You will not believe
the fascism afoot at Baxter High.

04:13.586 --> 04:16.547
So, I go to get my book assignment
approved from Mr. Garland,

04:16.631 --> 04:17.966
and you know what he says?

04:18.049 --> 04:19.884
No. Rejected.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.303
Because my book has been deemed
problematic.

04:22.387 --> 04:24.889
-Wait, but The Bluest Eye is a classic.
-Exactly!

04:24.973 --> 04:29.018
No one should get to decide
what we can and can't read.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.061
Agreed.

04:30.144 --> 04:33.439
How can we help, Roz

04:33.523 --> 04:36.442
I mean, that's why our club exists.

04:36.693 --> 04:39.279
We'll take the fight to Hawthorne.
Right, Sabrina?

04:40.655 --> 04:43.992
Um... yeah. Absolutely, if that's what Roz wants.

04:46.160 --> 04:47.245
Yeah.

04:47.954 --> 04:48.788
Yeah.

04:51.874 --> 04:55.670
Firstly, let me say very clearly
and for the record,

04:55.753 --> 04:58.589
we do not ban books at Baxter High.

04:59.716 --> 05:02.677
Miss Spellman, have I grown a second head?

05:03.761 --> 05:05.888
No. No, no, no, sir.

05:05.972 --> 05:08.975
Okay. Then why are you looking at me
as if I had?

05:11.185 --> 05:15.398
Principal Hawthorne, why did Mr. Garland
say no to The Bluest Eye,

05:15.481 --> 05:16.774
and call it controversial?

05:16.858 --> 05:21.612
The book that you proposed
has very graphic passages.

05:21.696 --> 05:24.866
I'm certain that Mr. Garland
would've raised the same objections

05:24.949 --> 05:28.870
had you proposed
A Clockwork Orange or Lolita.

05:28.953 --> 05:31.039
So you're saying
those books are banned as well?

05:31.122 --> 05:33.624
I'm saying that this is a public school,

05:34.042 --> 05:37.628
and certain topics and titles

05:37.837 --> 05:41.924
have no place in the hands
of impressionable youths.

05:50.808 --> 05:54.896
Wait, Roz, what are you doing

05:54.979 --> 05:58.733
I just-- I don't believe Hawthorne
for one second.

05:58.816 --> 06:02.820
He may not officially ban books,
but here, Susie, look this up.

06:02.904 --> 06:04.447
Sabrina, see if you can find this one.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.675
Ms. Curtis, we have a problem.

06:24.759 --> 06:27.720
Uh, this stack of cards.
None of these books are on the shelves.

06:29.222 --> 06:32.392
Yes, I believe these books
have been checked out.

06:32.934 --> 06:34.143
For a while.

06:34.602 --> 06:35.728
What do you mean?

06:37.271 --> 06:40.858
Well, you didn't hear this from me,
but a few years back,

06:40.942 --> 06:45.154
there was a...
a soft purge of bad books.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.452
Aunt Zelda?

06:51.536 --> 06:55.039
Hilda? You're not gonna believe
what happened at school today.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.707
Oh, we can imagine.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.501
Do you know what this is?

06:59.752 --> 07:03.089
I'll tell you. It's an Infernal Summons.

07:03.172 --> 07:04.006
A what now?

07:04.090 --> 07:08.845
Well, you've been charged
with a rather antiquated offense, dearest.

07:09.178 --> 07:10.096
Breach of Promise.

07:10.179 --> 07:13.474
You made a promise to sign the Dark Lord's
Book of the Beast and then,

07:13.558 --> 07:16.018
when you ran in horror
from your dark baptism,

07:16.102 --> 07:17.186
you broke it.

07:17.645 --> 07:20.481
You humiliated our master
in front of the entire coven,

07:20.565 --> 07:25.361
and now, you will be judged and tried
in front of the entire coven.

07:26.237 --> 07:30.241
Never, in all my years,
has a Spellman been summoned

07:30.324 --> 07:31.409
to the Court of Witches.

07:31.492 --> 07:34.036
I don't understand. Someone is suing me?

07:34.787 --> 07:35.788
The Dark Lord.

07:36.497 --> 07:39.625
He's determined
to get you on the Path of Night.

07:39.709 --> 07:42.587
I saw him today, the Dark Lord.

07:42.670 --> 07:46.090
He took possession of Principal Hawthorne
and threatened me.

07:48.384 --> 07:49.802
Did you hear that, sister?

07:50.386 --> 07:52.680
Can you imagine how enraged he must be?

07:52.763 --> 07:55.892
Well, it doesn't matter.
I don't want to be a part of his coven,

07:55.975 --> 07:58.686
I don't want to step foot
in the Academy of Unseen Arts,

07:58.769 --> 08:02.148
and I am certainly not gonna stand trial.

08:02.231 --> 08:05.693
Oh, you most certainly are, Sabrina.
You've been summoned.

08:05.776 --> 08:08.237
And not only you. Hilda and I as well.

08:10.198 --> 08:11.574
We're on trial too.

08:13.117 --> 08:14.827
That doesn't make any sense.

08:14.911 --> 08:17.163
Well, we're your legal guardians, lamb.

08:17.246 --> 08:19.624
So, in the eyes
of the Court of the Witches,

08:19.707 --> 08:21.584
your actions are our actions.

08:22.001 --> 08:24.545
-We're as guilty as you.
-Don't you mean innocent?

08:24.629 --> 08:27.256
-Innocent until proven guilty?
-That's mortal law.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.676
Witch law is the complete opposite.
Guilty until proven innocent.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.011
Do you know what this is?

08:33.095 --> 08:35.306
It's your Aunt Hilda's tooth.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.725
We have been stripped of our powers.

08:37.808 --> 08:42.605
Which means that we will age and rot,
rapidly, until a verdict is reached.

08:43.981 --> 08:46.692
Your trial begins at midnight.

08:54.659 --> 08:57.078
I didn't promise the Dark Lord anything.

08:57.161 --> 08:59.163
I didn't sign the Book of the Beast.

09:00.081 --> 09:02.792
And yet, I still have to go to court
and be punished.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.544
Can't I fight this somehow?

09:04.627 --> 09:06.254
You can, but you'll need help.

09:06.337 --> 09:08.548
Have you ever heard of a man
named Daniel Webster?

09:09.298 --> 09:10.299
I don't think so.

09:10.383 --> 09:13.511
He's a lawyer and occultist
who specializes in witch law.

09:13.928 --> 09:15.471
Total legend.

09:15.888 --> 09:17.765
He's mortal, but, uh...

09:18.683 --> 09:21.686
he's rumored to have once
beaten the Devil himself.

09:22.103 --> 09:23.479
-I'm in.
-Mmm-hmm.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.815
-Where does he live?
-That's the kismet part.

09:25.898 --> 09:28.568
He lives right here. In Greendale.

09:29.110 --> 09:30.278
Willingly?

09:30.361 --> 09:31.696
-Why?
-Don't know.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.156
Bit reclusive, maybe?

09:35.741 --> 09:38.327
You're going to be
the Dark Lord's prosecutor, I imagine.

09:38.411 --> 09:41.789
I don't relish it, but that is
one of my duties as High Priest, yes.

09:41.872 --> 09:46.877
Please, Faustus,
Sabrina made a foolish, impetuous mistake.

09:47.545 --> 09:50.673
Couldn't we settle this between ourselves?

09:50.756 --> 09:52.967
You, me, the Dark Lord...

09:54.010 --> 09:56.971
without the embarrassing spectacle
of a public trial?

09:57.763 --> 10:00.766
The wheels of justice
are already turning,Â Zelda.

10:06.480 --> 10:07.481
However...

10:08.149 --> 10:11.152
come tonight... with Sabrina...

10:12.361 --> 10:16.115
have her admit her wrongdoing
and beg for forgiveness, immediately.

10:16.532 --> 10:18.367
The Dark Lord is not without mercy.

10:18.993 --> 10:21.829
But he'll require
total submission from the girl.

10:21.912 --> 10:23.164
And he shall have it.

10:25.207 --> 10:26.375
I promise you.

10:28.169 --> 10:29.503
Poor Zelda.

10:31.589 --> 10:34.300
Already, I see
the ravages of age upon you.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.734
Thank you for your time, Faustus.

10:58.074 --> 10:59.241
See you in court.

11:06.707 --> 11:08.376
I don't enjoy being watched.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.925
The girl is my charge.

11:20.554 --> 11:23.641
I can't risk leaving her fate in...

11:24.809 --> 11:26.727
lesser hands.

11:27.812 --> 11:29.980
And yet it is your own incompetence

11:30.147 --> 11:32.149
that has brought us to this moment.

11:35.736 --> 11:38.072
I eased her to the altar,

11:38.280 --> 11:39.657
as is my way.

11:39.740 --> 11:42.076
A hand on her shoulder,

11:42.159 --> 11:43.703
a whisper in her ear.

11:44.620 --> 11:48.332
But she was at the altar, Blackwood.

11:48.457 --> 11:50.835
You failed to get the signature.

11:51.043 --> 11:53.045
My dear demoness...

11:54.505 --> 11:56.507
your methods are weak,

11:56.882 --> 11:58.467
your will is womanly.

11:58.592 --> 12:00.594
Now I will be the hammer...

12:01.178 --> 12:03.180
that drives this nail home.

12:03.347 --> 12:06.267
As you're blunt, like a hammer,
that's true.

12:06.350 --> 12:10.020
But don't underestimate her, warlock.

12:11.230 --> 12:13.983
And don't disrespect me.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.445
High Priest or not...

12:18.904 --> 12:20.030
you're still a man.

12:25.244 --> 12:26.704
And I feast...

12:27.997 --> 12:30.416
on male flesh.

12:48.142 --> 12:49.935
Are you Daniel Webster?

12:50.895 --> 12:51.771
No.

12:52.980 --> 12:54.148
Why

12:55.274 --> 12:57.318
My name is Sabrina Spellman.

12:58.235 --> 12:59.278
Spellman?

12:59.528 --> 13:02.281
And I need a lawyer... to fight the Devil.

13:04.325 --> 13:07.745
I'd offer you a seat, but that would
encourage you to stay, so...

13:07.828 --> 13:10.790
Mr. Webster,
I'm being charged with Breach of Promise.

13:11.874 --> 13:13.417
I ran from my Dark Baptism.

13:15.836 --> 13:17.296
You know what that is, right?

13:18.339 --> 13:19.924
Oh, yeah. I'm familiar.

13:21.175 --> 13:24.053
So what

13:24.804 --> 13:25.888
Renounced Satan?

13:25.971 --> 13:28.933
No. No, I-- I'm a half-witch.

13:31.268 --> 13:35.189
They lied and coerced me,
but I didn't sign the Book of the Beast.

13:35.272 --> 13:37.983
And now my family is being punished.

13:38.400 --> 13:41.445
I have to be in court tonight,
in a few hours, and...

13:42.822 --> 13:44.573
and I heard you might be able
to help me.

13:50.704 --> 13:51.580
No.

13:51.872 --> 13:52.790
Sorry.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.167
I don't practice anymore.

13:58.337 --> 14:00.130
Breach of Promise, that's tricky.

14:07.388 --> 14:08.722
Well, good luck to you.

14:37.668 --> 14:39.587
Hell and damnation.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.348
Hey, these are good, Harv.

14:51.807 --> 14:53.684
I mean, they're messed up.

14:54.935 --> 14:56.520
You're a twisted little weirdo.

14:57.146 --> 14:57.980
Thanks, Tommy.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.527
I showed them to the guy
that runs the bookstore.

15:03.777 --> 15:05.988
The vampire guy, you mean?

15:06.530 --> 15:08.657
Dr. Cerberus, yeah.

15:09.033 --> 15:11.201
He said I could do some posters
for his store.

15:11.827 --> 15:13.871
Maybe even work there weekends,
if I wanted.

15:14.079 --> 15:15.623
That your idea of a joke?

15:16.165 --> 15:18.334
You want to hang out
in the back of a comic book shop

15:18.417 --> 15:20.294
with some pervert who plays dress-up?

15:20.502 --> 15:22.004
Dad, jeez, relax.

15:22.504 --> 15:24.131
You want a job, Harvey?

15:24.506 --> 15:27.134
I've got a job for you. In the mines.

15:27.426 --> 15:30.346
-You'll start with a shift this week.
-Dad, we can manage fine without--

15:30.638 --> 15:31.680
You heard him, Tom.

15:32.264 --> 15:35.726
Your brother's ready to work,
and I'm giving him work. End of story.

15:47.363 --> 15:48.405
Remember, ladies,

15:48.489 --> 15:51.617
we carry ourselves
with aplomb and dignity.

15:51.700 --> 15:54.536
We admit our wrongs,
accept our punishment,

15:54.870 --> 15:57.539
and try to put this whole sordid mess
behind us.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.708
-Isn't that right, Sabrina?

15:59.875 --> 16:01.251
Do I have a choice?

16:01.335 --> 16:02.586
Not really, no.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.554
We, the profane...

16:13.514 --> 16:16.016
gather here tonight
in this sacrilegious Court

16:16.100 --> 16:17.851
to serve the Dark Lord's justice.

16:18.560 --> 16:21.647
A deplorable crime has been committed
against our master and savior.

16:21.730 --> 16:24.525
-Hail Satan! Praise him!
-Praise Satan.

16:24.608 --> 16:29.238
Sabrina Spellman stands accused
before The Infernal Three,

16:29.571 --> 16:35.619
guilty of breaking her promise,
her pledge, to the Dark Lord.

16:36.120 --> 16:41.250
Sabrina Spellman, stand.

16:46.547 --> 16:48.632
When the accused is confirmed guilty,

16:48.716 --> 16:53.220
not only will she abandon
her mortal life immediately,

16:53.554 --> 16:59.393
but, upon her death,
she shall burn for 333 years in the Pit,

16:59.476 --> 17:01.311
as his pleasure demands.

17:06.191 --> 17:09.403
Accused, how plead you?

17:09.820 --> 17:12.072
I... I...

17:16.285 --> 17:18.287
She pleads not guilty.

17:25.711 --> 17:26.795
Mr. Webster.

17:30.674 --> 17:35.471
You are not unknown to this court,
but you are unwelcome, sir, and uninvited.

17:35.554 --> 17:36.764
Untrue, sir.

17:38.140 --> 17:42.644
-Where my client goes... I follow.
-Client?

17:44.063 --> 17:47.733
-Sabrina?
-He's my lawyer, Aunt Zelda.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.322
As if things weren't dire enough,

17:53.405 --> 17:57.493
you go and hire this mortal pettifogger
behind our backs.

17:57.576 --> 18:01.622
With all due respect, madam,
I am well-versed in witch law.

18:01.705 --> 18:04.291
Oh, I know exactly who you are,
Mr. Webster.

18:04.958 --> 18:08.003
I remember you sniffing around my brother
years ago.

18:08.378 --> 18:10.172
A hanger-on, a dilettante.

18:10.255 --> 18:12.466
Wait. You knew my father?

18:13.383 --> 18:15.219
He's the reason I came to Greendale.

18:16.178 --> 18:18.514
Your father taught me witch law...

18:19.556 --> 18:21.517
offered me comfort when there was none.

18:21.892 --> 18:22.976
He helped me out.

18:24.520 --> 18:25.979
I'd like to return the favor.

18:29.858 --> 18:33.862
Do you know what Breach of Promise means,
Miss Spellman?

18:33.946 --> 18:37.157
It's when you make a promise,
and then break it.

18:37.699 --> 18:40.661
Which I, categorically, did not do.

18:40.744 --> 18:41.995
It is most commonly invoked

18:42.079 --> 18:45.249
when a groom runs out on a bride
he's promised to wed.

18:45.332 --> 18:47.042
I only mention that, because...

18:47.126 --> 18:50.337
...well, were you and the Dark Lord
not courting

18:50.420 --> 18:52.506
in advance of your Dark Baptism?

18:53.340 --> 18:55.509
"Courting"

18:55.592 --> 18:58.137
Did you not willingly go into the woods
that night?

18:58.720 --> 19:01.890
Wearing, of all things, a wedding dress?

19:03.433 --> 19:05.018
Fact is, you gave every indication

19:05.102 --> 19:07.521
that it was your intention
to fulfill a promise made.

19:07.604 --> 19:09.982
You showed up for a ceremony
you'd committed to

19:10.065 --> 19:13.360
and then, at the moment
of consummation, you fled.

19:16.029 --> 19:17.322
You broke your promise.

19:20.701 --> 19:21.618
That's all.

19:22.411 --> 19:23.245
Guilty!

19:24.371 --> 19:26.874
-Tramp!

19:30.127 --> 19:33.505
Sabrina, members of the court,

19:33.589 --> 19:35.883
where is the tangible proof?

19:36.300 --> 19:40.220
If this baptism is to be considered
a wedding,

19:40.304 --> 19:42.306
where is the marriage license?

19:42.890 --> 19:45.517
The blood tests
this great township demands?

19:46.059 --> 19:47.811
Show me the signatures!

19:48.604 --> 19:50.522
Hell, show me the groom!

19:53.567 --> 19:54.526
No contract.

19:55.152 --> 19:56.278
No promise.

19:57.738 --> 19:58.655
No case.

20:01.450 --> 20:02.576
Your Dishonors...

20:03.619 --> 20:07.789
I'd like to submit into evidence
our most unholy grimoire,

20:08.415 --> 20:09.666
the Book of the Beast.

20:11.293 --> 20:15.130
Miss Spellman, would you be so kind
as to open it to the page I've indicated?

20:20.969 --> 20:25.724
Would you please read the name
that's been written... there?

20:26.850 --> 20:28.268
Nice and loud, child.

20:28.352 --> 20:31.355
It says, "Sabrina Spellman."

20:32.064 --> 20:33.607
-But...

20:34.107 --> 20:35.567
I don't understand this.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.819
This is dated
only a few days after I was--

20:37.903 --> 20:43.951
Your Dishonors, are we to believe that
a baby signed the Book of the Beast

20:44.034 --> 20:45.702
three days after she was born?

20:45.786 --> 20:49.331
This is obviously a fraud,
a blatant forgery.

20:49.414 --> 20:51.541
I call to the stand Zelda Phiona Spellman.

20:54.044 --> 20:55.712
What? Impossible!

20:58.382 --> 21:00.425
Aunt Zelda, what's happening?

21:07.224 --> 21:09.351
Ms. Spellman. Zelda.

21:10.936 --> 21:14.147
Take us back to this date written here.

21:17.567 --> 21:19.361
Of course, Your Excellency.

21:20.529 --> 21:21.363
I...

21:22.531 --> 21:25.951
I accompanied my brother
into the Greendale Wood.

21:27.244 --> 21:33.000
In his arms, he carried
his newborn daughter... Sabrina.

21:34.001 --> 21:39.256
When we reached a clearing,
he placed the babe on an altar, and...

21:41.049 --> 21:42.718
signed her name
in the Book of the Beast.

21:45.387 --> 21:47.264
Promising her soul to the Dark Lord.

21:49.433 --> 21:50.434
What?

21:53.395 --> 21:54.813
Now it makes sense!

21:54.896 --> 21:57.941
All your strong-arming trying
to get me to sign.

21:58.025 --> 21:59.735
You were just trying to cover up the fact

21:59.818 --> 22:03.113
that you had already pawned me off
to the Dark Lord like a used car.

22:03.196 --> 22:05.324
You were never meant to find out.

22:05.907 --> 22:08.493
You were meant to choose the Path of Night

22:08.577 --> 22:10.704
and sign your name willingly. That way--

22:10.787 --> 22:15.792
That way, I never would've found out
about my father's betrayal and yours?

22:17.919 --> 22:19.504
Edward needed a witness.

22:20.047 --> 22:22.424
Why would he do that to me?

22:25.344 --> 22:27.387
A certain bargain had been struck,

22:27.471 --> 22:32.017
and the price your father paid for it
was your name in that book.

22:32.267 --> 22:33.852
What could've been worth it?

22:36.355 --> 22:38.065
Permission to marry your mother.

22:38.315 --> 22:40.859
The Dark Lord granted it in exchange for--

22:40.942 --> 22:43.403
For me... his daughter.

22:44.029 --> 22:48.200
And you stood there,
and you watched him do it, Aunt Zelda!

22:48.283 --> 22:50.160
You helped him do it!

23:02.255 --> 23:03.507
Daddy?

23:05.342 --> 23:07.469
Why did you let me die, Daddy?

23:08.095 --> 23:10.138
It hurt so much.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.098
Stop.

23:11.890 --> 23:15.602
You should be spending your time
getting ready to join me down here, Daddy.

23:17.104 --> 23:21.108
Not defending a useless,
backwoods, half-breed witch.

23:24.861 --> 23:28.240
Tick-tock, Daniel Webster.

23:29.449 --> 23:32.077
Tick-tock.

23:32.994 --> 23:35.372
Tick-tock.

23:36.331 --> 23:38.875
Tick-tock.

23:55.058 --> 23:56.476
Caffeine not kicking in yet?

23:57.185 --> 23:58.603
I didn't sleep very well.

23:59.146 --> 24:01.481
My Aunt Zelda and I
got into a fight, and...

24:03.191 --> 24:06.069
Is it okay if we don't talk about it?
I'm sorry.

24:06.486 --> 24:07.529
Of course.

24:09.531 --> 24:11.783
I got into it with my old man
last night, too.

24:13.577 --> 24:17.831
He's, uh...
making me start work at the mines.

24:18.331 --> 24:21.751
What You hate the mines.

24:21.835 --> 24:24.629
I don't just... ...hate them, Sabrina, I--

24:25.088 --> 24:26.173
What

24:28.258 --> 24:29.217
What is it?

24:33.472 --> 24:36.641
Eight years ago,
I was playing hide-and-seek

24:37.100 --> 24:39.102
with Tommy and a couple of his buddies.

24:40.020 --> 24:44.149
And I, like an idiot,
decided to go hide in the mines.

24:45.901 --> 24:47.986
And I'm in there, alone.

24:49.237 --> 24:52.824
Half-an-hour goes by, and then an hour...

24:54.159 --> 24:55.577
and no one finds me.

24:56.870 --> 24:59.247
And I'm trying to get back
to the mine entrance.

25:02.375 --> 25:03.418
And then I...

25:07.047 --> 25:08.882
And then I saw it, Sabrina.

25:10.300 --> 25:11.134
What?

25:11.801 --> 25:14.012
It's gonna sound crazy,
but I swear to God it...

25:16.097 --> 25:17.349
It looked like a goat.

25:17.933 --> 25:21.394
Only bigger, and standing upright
on its hind legs, and it...

25:21.978 --> 25:25.232
it smelled like a...
a book of matches had been struck.

25:25.815 --> 25:26.775
Brimstone.

25:27.317 --> 25:28.610
And it terrified me.

25:29.236 --> 25:31.696
I couldn't move. I couldn't breathe.

25:32.405 --> 25:33.657
I started to cry.

25:36.368 --> 25:39.204
I was still crying when Tommy found me
five hours later.

25:41.331 --> 25:42.457
It's been years.

25:42.749 --> 25:44.459
No one else has seen the goat guy.

25:46.378 --> 25:47.671
But I keep thinking...

25:48.630 --> 25:50.715
Sabrina, what if it's still down there...

25:51.591 --> 25:52.717
waiting for me?

25:58.515 --> 26:02.477
Take one. It's required reading.
There you go. Here, take it.

26:03.728 --> 26:06.773
-You'll never guess, Sabrina.
-What's happening, Ms. Wardwell?

26:06.856 --> 26:10.610
Well, the young ladies of W-I-C-C-A,
that's WICCA to you, Mr. Kinkle,

26:11.444 --> 26:12.988
are making their voices heard.

26:13.613 --> 26:15.073
Thank you. Thank you.

26:15.156 --> 26:21.121
Here's a list of books
Baxter High doesn't want you to read!

26:21.329 --> 26:24.916
And they also happen to be
great works of literature.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.710
You guys, when did you do this?

26:26.793 --> 26:29.838
-Last night.
-I mean, they're just books, you know.

26:29.921 --> 26:33.091
What are people so afraid of?
That Principal Hawthorne's gonna--

26:36.261 --> 26:39.306
Ladies, about your claims.

26:39.389 --> 26:43.018
You can't punish someone for handing out
flyers, Principal Hawthorne.

26:43.101 --> 26:45.270
On the contrary, MissÂ Spellman,

26:45.353 --> 26:50.650
I just wanted Miss Walker to know
that I called the PTA and the school board

26:50.734 --> 26:52.777
about The Bluest Eye.

26:53.028 --> 26:54.779
They are reviewing the matter,

26:54.863 --> 26:57.574
and will come back to me tomorrow
with their thoughts.

26:59.242 --> 27:01.661
You're welcome, Miss Walker.

27:45.580 --> 27:46.831
Did you know him well?

27:47.540 --> 27:48.416
Connor?

27:49.417 --> 27:50.919
We dated a few times, but...

27:51.544 --> 27:52.962
I'm sorry for your loss.

27:55.048 --> 27:57.717
-My name's Ambrose, by the way.
-Luke.

27:58.426 --> 27:59.260
I, uh...

27:59.803 --> 28:01.763
I'm just gonna miss him, that's all.

28:03.056 --> 28:04.766
Him and that stupid lizard of his.

28:06.976 --> 28:08.770
-He took it everywhere.
-Hmm.

28:09.104 --> 28:10.522
Yeah, or it followed him.

28:11.940 --> 28:13.817
They never stray far, do they?

28:15.568 --> 28:20.365
Are you saying you're familiar...
with iguanas like that?

28:22.617 --> 28:25.120
I'm saying that I know Connor was very...

28:25.662 --> 28:26.496
attached to it.

28:27.539 --> 28:30.333
-They had a bond.
-Because I have him.

28:31.126 --> 28:32.127
Upstairs.

28:33.336 --> 28:34.421
In my room.

28:36.506 --> 28:38.591
If you wanted to say hi.

28:46.641 --> 28:47.642
I should go.

28:48.226 --> 28:51.229
But... another time maybe.

29:01.448 --> 29:03.324
By the autumn of 1805,

29:03.408 --> 29:07.287
the men of the Lewis and Clark Expedition
were starving, desperate,

29:07.370 --> 29:08.580
and running out of time.

29:08.663 --> 29:11.249
Just before them
lay the Continental Divide,

29:11.332 --> 29:13.126
and just beyond that...

30:51.140 --> 30:52.517
Why are you helping me?

30:52.851 --> 30:57.063
What do you want out of this,
Defender of the Damned?

30:57.188 --> 30:58.022
Oh.

30:59.148 --> 31:00.525
Okay. So you know.

31:00.608 --> 31:05.113
The people you've helped set free,
murderers and monsters.

31:05.196 --> 31:07.156
The kinds of crimes they've committed.

31:07.240 --> 31:11.035
-Everyone's entitled to a defense.
-Not you. You're fired.

31:11.786 --> 31:13.705
Wait! Sabrina, stop.

31:15.373 --> 31:19.210
I've been where you are right now,
trapped by the Devil.

31:19.961 --> 31:23.298
I made a deal, a long time ago,

31:23.548 --> 31:26.634
to be the greatest lawyer in the world.

31:28.177 --> 31:29.804
I was young and ambitious.

31:30.346 --> 31:32.640
And I signed my name away.

31:32.807 --> 31:33.850
A different book...

31:34.809 --> 31:35.852
but the same beast.

31:37.520 --> 31:40.356
And what do you know?
I started winning cases.

31:41.357 --> 31:45.737
And by the time I realized the only cases
I got were the most depraved,

31:45.820 --> 31:49.324
the most obscene, it was too late.

31:49.782 --> 31:53.536
And that was his little trick, you see.
And there's always a trick.

31:55.872 --> 31:56.915
And a price.

32:01.085 --> 32:02.712
I set a man free...

32:03.379 --> 32:07.508
who had done unspeakable things
to a number of women.

32:09.218 --> 32:10.929
And after I freed him,

32:11.554 --> 32:14.140
when I wasn't home, he broke in...

32:17.018 --> 32:18.519
and he did those things...

32:19.687 --> 32:20.647
to my daughter.

32:21.564 --> 32:22.523
Oh, no.

32:22.690 --> 32:27.654
Now I know that I have done
more than my share of bad in the past.

32:30.782 --> 32:35.328
But I think...
that I might be able to save you.

32:36.996 --> 32:38.122
If you'll let me.

32:38.873 --> 32:40.041
It's a long shot...

32:41.417 --> 32:42.502
but maybe.

32:50.301 --> 32:54.681
Ms. Spellman, both you and your sister
are certified midwives.

32:54.764 --> 32:55.932
-Yes.
-Yes.

32:56.683 --> 33:00.186
You have delivered many babies
in the witch community,

33:00.269 --> 33:02.522
including your own niece, Sabrina.

33:02.855 --> 33:03.690
-Yes.
-Yes.

33:03.773 --> 33:05.900
Can you verify for the court, then...

33:06.859 --> 33:09.904
was Sabrina born of mortal woman?

33:09.988 --> 33:11.906
-She was, yes.
-Absolutely, yes.

33:12.115 --> 33:16.911
Making her half-witch,
half-mortal and, therefore,

33:16.995 --> 33:19.706
only half-subject
to the laws of this court!

33:19.789 --> 33:21.874
This is absurd, Your Dishonors.

33:21.958 --> 33:24.043
No, sir, it is her right!

33:24.544 --> 33:27.046
I demand a jury of mortals!

33:27.130 --> 33:30.341
And a change of venue!

33:30.425 --> 33:33.469
I reject the authority of this court
over my client!

33:33.803 --> 33:37.015
Disorder in the court!

33:54.782 --> 33:57.618
-"Psst! Open the window, Mark."
-Judas Priest!

33:59.454 --> 34:00.288
Luke.

34:03.082 --> 34:04.208
How did you get in here?

34:04.292 --> 34:07.295
You invited me earlier, remember?

34:07.920 --> 34:10.965
-So what, you're a vampire?
-No, I'm a warlock.

34:11.466 --> 34:13.301
Like Connor was. Like you are.

34:15.928 --> 34:16.888
Aren't you?

34:29.400 --> 34:30.735
The prosecution

34:30.818 --> 34:34.030
and witching community are familiar
with human law, Mr. Webster.

34:34.614 --> 34:38.534
If Sabrina's true, dominant nature
is to be determined mortal or witch,

34:38.618 --> 34:39.660
so be it.

34:39.744 --> 34:42.121
We shall invoke human laws to test her.

34:43.998 --> 34:46.292
We may subject Sabrina to trial by water.

34:46.375 --> 34:49.212
She will be bound
and dropped into the river.

34:49.295 --> 34:51.380
-If she floats, she's a witch.

34:51.756 --> 34:54.842
If she drowns, she's human.
And free to go.

34:57.386 --> 35:00.098
The accused will submit
to being stripped and examined,

35:00.181 --> 35:03.559
in full view of the coven,
for a witch's mark upon her body.

35:03.643 --> 35:07.855
Should a mark be identified,
this trial continues, uninterrupted.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.774
Should no mark be found,

35:10.149 --> 35:13.945
this court will be forced to recognize
her so-called "humanity."

35:15.905 --> 35:16.739
Yes!

35:18.282 --> 35:20.159
Absolutely not, I forbid it!

35:20.243 --> 35:22.912
Sit down, Zelda, before you collapse.
You're skin and bone.

35:22.995 --> 35:24.789
Sabrina, I have to ask.

35:25.164 --> 35:27.875
Do you even know if you have a mark?

35:27.959 --> 35:29.669
Let's start there.

35:30.128 --> 35:32.004
Perhaps there's another way.

35:35.216 --> 35:39.387
You'll excuse my unannounced visitation,
but I come bearing felicitous tidings.

35:39.637 --> 35:41.931
I've pleaded on your behalf
to the Dark Lord,

35:42.014 --> 35:45.434
and he has offered a path

35:45.935 --> 35:47.645
-through this thicket.

35:47.979 --> 35:49.063
Praise Satan!

35:49.480 --> 35:52.108
The Dark Lord will waive
your punishment in the Pit.

35:52.191 --> 35:55.778
He will even allow you yearly visitations
with your mortal friends,

35:55.862 --> 36:00.199
but... you must ratify your signature
in the Book of the Beast,

36:00.283 --> 36:02.326
and you must withdraw from Baxter High,

36:02.410 --> 36:06.414
and begin your studies
at the Academy of Unseen Arts immediately.

36:06.914 --> 36:08.833
But this is perfect! Sabrina!

36:09.167 --> 36:12.044
We'll await your answer
tomorrow night in court.

36:12.295 --> 36:13.129
Ladies.

36:14.130 --> 36:15.047
Sir.

36:24.223 --> 36:26.434
We will not take this deal.

36:26.517 --> 36:30.521
But the Dark Lord has been moved
by our plight to show mercy.

36:31.189 --> 36:35.526
-Do you know how rare that is?
-She's right. So think about that.

36:36.110 --> 36:39.739
Why offer a deal? It's a trick.

36:39.822 --> 36:41.532
Remember whom you're dealing with!

37:10.811 --> 37:11.771
Uh-huh.

37:15.858 --> 37:17.568
Still got it, Spellman.

37:30.206 --> 37:33.167
I guess you couldn't live
without Connor, little one.

37:38.047 --> 37:40.549
What are you smiling at Nothing.

37:41.050 --> 37:43.052
It's just...

37:43.636 --> 37:46.722
You get this look on your face
when you're thinking stuff over...

37:47.473 --> 37:50.309
and I always wonder what it is,
because you look so serious.

37:50.977 --> 37:53.229
Harvey, can I talk to you
about something...

37:56.023 --> 37:57.608
that is serious?

37:58.651 --> 37:59.610
Always.

37:59.694 --> 38:02.405
I... have to ask you for a favor,

38:02.488 --> 38:04.991
and it's gonna sound crazy...

38:05.783 --> 38:07.201
but it's important.

38:08.411 --> 38:09.537
I can do crazy.

38:10.162 --> 38:11.122
And important.

38:20.548 --> 38:22.550
My aunts say
every Spellman has a birthmark,

38:22.633 --> 38:25.469
but I can't find one
and I have to be sure,

38:25.553 --> 38:26.721
one way or the other.

38:36.063 --> 38:36.981
Will you look?

38:38.316 --> 38:39.191
For a birthmark?

38:40.776 --> 38:46.282
-I'm so confused right now.
-Me too. I'm super confused about, well...

38:47.950 --> 38:49.410
everything, except you.

38:49.994 --> 38:51.996
-I'm not confused about you.
-Me neither.

38:52.079 --> 38:55.333
Because I love you,
and I trust you to do the right thing,

38:55.416 --> 38:56.709
and to tell me the truth.

38:56.792 --> 38:59.670
In fact, I trust you more than I do
anyone else right now.

39:26.822 --> 39:27.782
Fair is fair, right?

40:01.732 --> 40:03.150
Before you keep looking...

40:16.455 --> 40:17.498
Hey.

40:21.168 --> 40:22.128
What's wrong?

40:22.878 --> 40:25.214
We got called
into Principal Hawthorne's office

40:25.297 --> 40:27.508
because he had some news
about the book banning--

40:27.591 --> 40:29.385
The PTA said they'd hold
a town hall meeting,

40:29.718 --> 40:33.639
where we could present our case
to the school board. In three months.

40:35.766 --> 40:39.603
Okay, well, three weeks, three months,

40:39.687 --> 40:43.023
even if it takes three whole years, Roz,
we're gonna make them understand.

40:43.107 --> 40:44.525
That's what I said. Yeah.

40:44.775 --> 40:47.236
Yeah. Yeah, no.

40:47.319 --> 40:48.696
I know.

40:49.697 --> 40:51.198
Three months is not that long.

40:51.782 --> 40:53.200
Roz, what's going on?

41:01.917 --> 41:03.794
I'm sorry.

41:04.170 --> 41:06.464
I'm always trying to do what my dad said,

41:07.298 --> 41:10.134
"Pray and face it bravely."

41:11.385 --> 41:13.179
That's his solution for everything.

41:14.930 --> 41:16.891
But prayer's not gonna stop it.

41:17.433 --> 41:18.434
Stop what?

41:25.774 --> 41:27.526
Myopic atrophy.

41:30.571 --> 41:32.823
Dr. Spector says that, uh...

41:34.116 --> 41:35.618
in about three months...

41:37.244 --> 41:38.454
maybe less,

41:38.996 --> 41:42.875
the ugliest, thickest glasses
in the world aren't gonna stop me

41:42.958 --> 41:44.877
from going totally blind.

41:51.217 --> 41:54.637
You know, I even counted how many books...

41:55.262 --> 41:59.141
I could realistically read
before it's too late.

42:00.434 --> 42:04.480
That's why every single one is important.

42:18.494 --> 42:21.038
It's a short shift.
Couple hours' hard work,

42:21.413 --> 42:23.624
back up topside
with some dirt on your face.

42:24.166 --> 42:25.417
It'll shut Dad up.

42:26.168 --> 42:28.754
You'll be on my crew, and I promise,

42:28.837 --> 42:31.006
I won't let you outta my... sight.

42:31.799 --> 42:32.633
Harv?

42:38.055 --> 42:39.181
Harvey?

42:40.266 --> 42:41.100
Harv?

42:42.101 --> 42:43.602
It's okay.

42:43.686 --> 42:47.231
Just... take a breath.

42:49.567 --> 42:52.611
Tommy... I can't.

42:53.153 --> 42:54.947
-It's okay. It's okay.
-I can't. I just--

42:56.156 --> 42:56.991
I know.

42:58.617 --> 42:59.702
I remember.

43:00.786 --> 43:03.205
Look, for today, why don't you head home?

43:03.914 --> 43:05.082
We'll try again later.

43:06.458 --> 43:09.086
-But Dad said--
-I'll see you at the house when I'm done.

43:11.171 --> 43:13.632
It's okay, Harv, I promise.

43:25.477 --> 43:28.731
Aunties, Mr. Webster,
I've made my decision.

43:32.151 --> 43:36.196
I'm not taking the deal.
I'll submit to Blackwood's exam.

43:37.114 --> 43:39.867
I don't have a witch's mark,
so there's nothing to lose.

43:39.950 --> 43:41.035
Except your dignity.

43:42.119 --> 43:44.913
-Aunt Zelda.
-Back into the fray, then, eh, cousin?

43:46.081 --> 43:49.501
When they find out I don't have a mark,
Mr. Webster, what happens then?

43:49.585 --> 43:50.919
We demand a retrial...

43:52.630 --> 43:56.300
in human court,
where you're innocent until proven guilty.

43:56.383 --> 43:59.386
And we demand that my aunties' powers
and youth are restored.

43:59.470 --> 44:00.971
It's non-negotiable.

44:01.055 --> 44:05.893
Thank you for that, sweetheart,
but to be stripped and pawed--

44:05.976 --> 44:07.561
I've had worse done to me.

44:09.229 --> 44:12.399
Besides, there are a lot of people facing
their fears right now,

44:12.483 --> 44:15.069
fighting battles they know
they're not gonna win.

44:15.152 --> 44:18.656
So, if this is mine, well,
then let's get it over with.

44:20.324 --> 44:22.868
But no tricks, no plea bargains.

44:26.455 --> 44:28.123
We should go. I'll be outside.

44:35.589 --> 44:38.175
It keeps getting worse and worse for her.

44:39.885 --> 44:42.262
-Where do you think you're going?
-Upstairs.

44:42.346 --> 44:45.349
Don't follow me. Don't wait for me.

44:45.432 --> 44:47.017
Just get her to the court.

44:47.851 --> 44:50.562
You're not the only one with secrets,
Zelda Spellman.

45:24.430 --> 45:26.724
Harvey!

45:29.143 --> 45:30.018
Harvey!

45:30.853 --> 45:32.771
Boy, when I tell you to do something,

45:32.855 --> 45:34.815
-you do it!
-Hey, Dad, get the hell off me!

45:34.898 --> 45:37.192
-Dad, stop it!

45:39.069 --> 45:40.446
You better watch yourself.

45:40.863 --> 45:42.823
And you, you're gonna get
in that damn mine,

45:42.906 --> 45:44.324
and work an honest-to-God shift.

45:45.075 --> 45:47.578
-He's gonna start pulling his weight.
-I'll get more guys.

45:48.162 --> 45:51.749
Push comes to shove, I'll take his shifts,
but Harvey's done, Dad.

45:52.374 --> 45:54.626
I'm not gonna let him
waste his life like...

46:11.894 --> 46:15.981
Sabrina, am I to understand
that you come now before this court

46:16.064 --> 46:18.108
to endure the test of the witch's mark,

46:18.192 --> 46:21.695
as described and demanded
by your mortal laws?

46:23.697 --> 46:25.657
Yes, Father Blackwood.

46:26.241 --> 46:29.369
We request the examination be held
in closed chambers.

46:29.453 --> 46:30.579
-Denied.
-Stop.

46:31.538 --> 46:32.498
Stop! Stop!

46:38.754 --> 46:43.175
If this is some feeble attempt to delay
the agreed-upon course of action--

46:43.258 --> 46:44.176
You're sure?

46:45.636 --> 46:48.806
Your Dishonors, I callÂ Hildegard
Antoinette Spellman to the stand!

46:48.889 --> 46:51.433
This is unacceptable!
The test is about to begin!

46:51.517 --> 46:56.230
-I demand that--
-Hilda Spellman, approach us.

47:01.944 --> 47:04.279
I have new evidence
to submit to the court.

47:06.198 --> 47:11.161
Ms. Spellman, please read
the name printed here on this document.

47:11.411 --> 47:14.164
Yes. It reads, um, "Sabrina Spellman."

47:14.456 --> 47:16.250
Witnessed by...

47:16.333 --> 47:19.545
Witnessed by her mother, Diana Spellman...

47:20.045 --> 47:23.382
and, well, me, Hilda Spellman.

47:25.759 --> 47:29.513
I offer in evidence
a baptismal certificate...

47:30.305 --> 47:32.724
from the Holy Mother Church of Greendale.

47:39.731 --> 47:42.901
Your Dishonors,
if this certificate is authentic...

47:43.694 --> 47:47.573
it would seem we have competing claims
upon the soul of Sabrina Spellman.

47:47.656 --> 47:51.451
No, sir, what we have
is a binding contract,

47:51.535 --> 47:53.328
witnessed by her mother...

47:54.204 --> 47:59.167
notarized and dated
one day before Edward Spellman inscribed

47:59.251 --> 48:01.587
his daughter's name
in the Book of the Beast...

48:02.212 --> 48:04.756
thereby rendering
the aforementioned inscription...

48:05.549 --> 48:11.471
the agreed-upon promise,
null and void, QED!

48:18.562 --> 48:22.065
These last-minute theatrics
make a mockery of thisÂ court!

48:22.566 --> 48:27.195
This... is spurious, this is outrageous!

48:27.279 --> 48:31.116
No, I'll tell you what's outrageous,
Father Blackwood.

48:31.950 --> 48:33.744
-The Dark Lord's behavior!

48:44.379 --> 48:45.464
Well, now.

48:45.964 --> 48:49.343
I'd say you just forced the Devil
to the bargaining table.

48:51.720 --> 48:55.891
And I've been summoned
to the court's private chambers.

49:26.880 --> 49:28.131
How could you, Hilda?

49:28.799 --> 49:30.926
How's it any different
to your secret with Edward?

49:31.009 --> 49:33.553
It's completely different! And appalling!

49:34.179 --> 49:35.389
A Christian church?

49:35.472 --> 49:37.516
Have you no shame

49:37.599 --> 49:41.186
So, Dad didn't know
that Mom had me baptized?

49:41.269 --> 49:42.312
In secret?

49:43.605 --> 49:46.566
-Why?
-She said not to tell him.

49:46.650 --> 49:50.070
I just assumed
it was Diana being sentimental.

49:50.362 --> 49:52.990
Perhaps she suspected
what Edward had planned.

49:54.324 --> 49:56.326
-So they were both deceivers.
-Sabrina!

49:56.785 --> 49:58.328
Honor Thy Father and Mother!

50:01.540 --> 50:03.583
No more secrets, Aunties.

50:04.584 --> 50:05.711
Do you understand?

50:06.586 --> 50:09.256
No more lying to me about my own family...

50:10.257 --> 50:11.842
ever again.

50:22.811 --> 50:26.982
Due to conflicts of contract,
baptism, and breeding,

50:27.607 --> 50:31.486
the Hellbound Court of Greendale decrees
that Sabrina Spellman...

50:32.988 --> 50:34.865
shall retain her mortal life...

50:37.451 --> 50:42.330
...on the condition that she also attend
the Academy of Unseen Arts...

50:43.165 --> 50:45.333
as well as weekly Black Mass.

50:48.128 --> 50:50.213
Think of it as dual-citizenship.

50:54.301 --> 50:55.343
Your Dishonors...

50:57.220 --> 50:58.263
I accept.

50:59.973 --> 51:00.891
So be it.

51:01.641 --> 51:03.643
This court is adjourned to the shadows.

51:04.186 --> 51:07.022
Full powers are restored
to the Spellman family.

51:12.235 --> 51:15.155
Praise Satan!Â I'm young again!

51:31.338 --> 51:32.547
Mr. Webster?

51:35.425 --> 51:37.677
Won't you come over to our house
to celebrate?

51:39.096 --> 51:41.723
It's late and I'm old.

51:42.557 --> 51:43.558
Another time.

51:45.310 --> 51:48.271
Well... thank you.

51:50.315 --> 51:51.525
For helping me win.

52:00.659 --> 52:01.785
Some advice.

52:02.994 --> 52:06.289
Take advantage of this qualified victory.

52:06.706 --> 52:10.627
Learn everything you can
about your adversary.

52:10.710 --> 52:13.588
And fight... for what's yours.

52:16.842 --> 52:18.593
Nobody's ever beaten the Devil...

52:20.428 --> 52:21.555
but you just might.

52:45.704 --> 52:47.414
That was Father Blackwood calling.

52:48.874 --> 52:54.045
It seems, Hilda, that you've been
excommunicated from the Church of Night.

52:55.297 --> 52:57.174
What?

52:59.342 --> 53:02.095
-They can't do that, can they?
-They most certainly can.

53:02.637 --> 53:03.597
And should.

53:04.848 --> 53:07.475
You took part in a Catholic baptism.

53:08.852 --> 53:11.730
You've cast doubt on our devotion
to the Church of Night.

53:11.813 --> 53:14.608
And our Dark Lord is a vengeful lord.

53:17.861 --> 53:19.571
What do I do now, then?

53:20.989 --> 53:21.823
Sister?

53:23.867 --> 53:26.328
Be grateful excommunication
is all that's being done to you.

53:44.221 --> 53:45.805
Did you come to congratulate me?

53:48.016 --> 53:48.850
No.

53:49.893 --> 53:51.561
And congratulate you on what?

53:52.562 --> 53:54.648
A half-victory is no victory at all.

53:54.731 --> 53:57.400
I delivered on my promise
to get her into the academy.

53:59.903 --> 54:03.114
And now that she's under my watch
and authority...

54:04.407 --> 54:05.951
I'll bend her to my will.

54:06.618 --> 54:08.245
-Or break her.
-Hmm.

54:08.328 --> 54:11.456
It's always brute force with you men,
isn't it?

54:15.335 --> 54:16.544
But real corruption...

54:17.420 --> 54:20.257
is a thin, subtle blade.

54:21.383 --> 54:22.467
Sabrina's strength,

54:22.968 --> 54:28.098
the bonds that must be severed,
are those to the mortals around her.

54:30.558 --> 54:32.060
The people she loves.

54:32.811 --> 54:36.606
But not to worry.
I'm quite good at tearing souls apart.

54:36.940 --> 54:39.859
One piece at a time.

54:45.573 --> 54:48.201
There you are!
We've been looking all over for you!

54:48.535 --> 54:49.369
Come with me.

54:55.834 --> 54:57.419
What is this?

55:00.422 --> 55:01.548
What's going on?

55:01.631 --> 55:03.341
Sabrina. Rosalind.

55:03.591 --> 55:07.137
Welcome to Baxter High's new,
secret book club.

55:07.846 --> 55:10.181
Sponsored by W-I-C-C-A.

55:10.432 --> 55:12.851
Banned titles only.

55:13.393 --> 55:15.312
With you leading the group, of course.

55:19.399 --> 55:20.692
Aw!

55:21.484 --> 55:23.069
I'm so proud of you girls.

55:23.653 --> 55:28.199
We're gonna have such great fun
reading all those juicy,

55:28.283 --> 55:30.910
forbidden novels that
they don't want us to.

55:32.037 --> 55:33.455
I've got quite a list.

55:34.831 --> 55:36.958
A little something for each of you.

56:46.569 --> 56:47.987
Brett, move your head.
