59:18.458 --> 59:20.500
[sighs] Was I wrong?

59:21.125 --> 59:22.125
Yep.

59:22.708 --> 59:25.041
I guess he was just trying to help.

59:26.791 --> 59:27.875
I don't know.

59:27.958 --> 59:30.416
Look, you were wrong and he was right.

59:30.500 --> 59:33.708
I mean you were being a brat
and he was trying to be a stand-up guy.

59:33.791 --> 59:35.000
Good Lord, woman--

59:35.083 --> 59:37.375
[woofing]

59:41.333 --> 59:45.041
Sometimes, I think you're going to be
my best and only friend forever.

59:45.125 --> 59:47.666
At least you'll never leave me.
Will you, buddy?

59:47.750 --> 59:50.333
No you won't. Oh, no you won't.

59:50.875 --> 59:54.000
You know what, [bleep] that guy.
He's dead to me.

59:55.250 --> 59:57.333
Oh! What's up, man?

1:00:01.416 --> 1:00:04.958
How much did you just hear?
Cause I was-- They were just jokes.

1:00:07.416 --> 1:00:09.500
[robot] I made you a gift.

1:00:09.583 --> 1:00:10.541
[Mai sighs]

1:00:25.208 --> 1:00:26.333
[click]

1:00:26.416 --> 1:00:28.791
[wheel squeaking]

1:00:35.625 --> 1:00:37.541
The most important parts of me...

1:00:38.291 --> 1:00:39.708
are the memories of you.

1:00:40.708 --> 1:00:42.250
It hurts when I lose them.

1:01:00.958 --> 1:01:02.333
[Mai sniffles]

1:01:03.541 --> 1:01:06.333
You lost something too.

1:01:06.416 --> 1:01:08.375
[Mai continues sniffling]

1:01:14.458 --> 1:01:15.416
Listen,

1:01:16.250 --> 1:01:21.250
would it help if I promise you
I'll never let you down again?

1:01:24.666 --> 1:01:26.916
How can you promise something like that?

1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:30.166
People leave
and there's nothing you can do about it.

1:01:32.125 --> 1:01:34.541
I don't know. You're probably right.

1:01:35.250 --> 1:01:38.250
I do know I don't want to lose you.

1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:41.583
Then, maybe...

1:01:42.833 --> 1:01:44.041
don't lose me.

1:01:44.583 --> 1:01:48.750
Mai, if I lost you, I'd be lost too.

1:01:53.791 --> 1:01:54.916
So...

1:01:56.291 --> 1:01:57.375
we cool?

1:01:58.791 --> 1:02:01.666
-You got my back?
-I do got your back.

1:02:02.458 --> 1:02:04.791
Then, yeah, we cool.

1:02:28.791 --> 1:02:29.666
Oh!

1:02:30.791 --> 1:02:32.750
Mom, don't freak out.

1:02:32.833 --> 1:02:34.958
Look, I can explain.

1:02:35.041 --> 1:02:38.500
I think you'd better
get your robot, young lady.

1:02:39.833 --> 1:02:42.208
-[whirring]
-Okay, okay.

1:02:42.291 --> 1:02:44.625
Optical CRT intact.

1:02:45.208 --> 1:02:47.666
Brachial prismatic joints are fine.

1:02:48.375 --> 1:02:49.958
Motor responses...

1:02:50.791 --> 1:02:53.125
This is where you removed
your memory storage unit.

1:02:53.208 --> 1:02:54.375
Uh-huh. I'm broken.

1:02:55.250 --> 1:02:57.291
Don't worry. I can fix it.

1:02:57.375 --> 1:03:00.666
This chip contains
a full system restore point.

1:03:00.750 --> 1:03:03.041
A disc image
from when I first created you.

1:03:03.125 --> 1:03:06.375
Run this and you'll be like new again.
A fresh start.

1:03:06.458 --> 1:03:08.333
Wait, a fresh start?

1:03:08.416 --> 1:03:10.291
Does that mean I lose my memories?

1:03:10.375 --> 1:03:13.416
-Woah, hands off hippy!
-Mai, don't be cute.

1:03:13.500 --> 1:03:17.333
-Want to tell me what this is all about?
-This is Dr. Rice, Mai,

1:03:17.416 --> 1:03:18.958
and that's his Q-Bot.

1:03:19.041 --> 1:03:23.625
No, no. This isn't a Q-Bot.
This is-- He is...

1:03:24.083 --> 1:03:26.708
something special. He has a purpose.

1:03:26.791 --> 1:03:29.458
[Q-Bot] Oh, I didn't know
we were expecting company.

1:03:29.541 --> 1:03:32.250
-Can I offer you a lava ca--
-[electric shock]

1:03:32.958 --> 1:03:34.791
Woah, what are you doing?

1:03:37.708 --> 1:03:39.375
-Sorry, listen--
-[Q-Bot] Sandlewood.

1:03:39.458 --> 1:03:40.875
[electric shock]

1:03:40.958 --> 1:03:43.125
Listen, something terrible
is about to happen.

1:03:43.208 --> 1:03:47.666
7723 is our only hope stopping it.
I designed him to stop it.

1:03:47.750 --> 1:03:49.750
-I get it. He's a weapon.
-What?

1:03:49.833 --> 1:03:53.625
-Why would you put weapons in a robot?
-Because it's awesome.

1:03:53.708 --> 1:03:55.000
Awesome indeed.

1:03:57.291 --> 1:03:59.041
I'm sorry, is now a bad time?

1:03:59.500 --> 1:04:02.166
I mean, should I come back?
I could always come back.

1:04:02.250 --> 1:04:05.291
-Who is this? How'd you get in here?
-Justin Pin?

1:04:05.375 --> 1:04:07.875
Oh, my gosh. I'm a huge fan,
I'm your biggest fan.

1:04:07.958 --> 1:04:10.666
[chuckles] I'm a huge fan of you!

1:04:11.958 --> 1:04:17.291
Ah, Dr, Tanner Rice here, really should be
more careful with this secret project.

1:04:18.750 --> 1:04:21.208
-Well this has been really great but--
-Justin.

1:04:21.291 --> 1:04:25.166
My old friend. If you're in there,
please hear me.

1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:27.708
Don't you remember the old days?

1:04:27.791 --> 1:04:30.291
Come on. Dude, it was so awesome!

1:04:30.375 --> 1:04:32.583
I mean, building robots for the people.

1:04:32.875 --> 1:04:34.958
Before Ares. Before all of this.

1:04:35.541 --> 1:04:38.375
-[Q-Bot] Foot rub later?
-[Dr. Rice] Come on. This isn't us.

1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:43.333
Seriously, when did making the world
a better place become killing people?

1:04:49.458 --> 1:04:50.500
Ahm...

1:04:52.208 --> 1:04:56.625
I actually think "killing people"
is making the world a better place.

1:04:56.708 --> 1:04:59.125
But I'm glad
that we have this out in the open.

1:04:59.208 --> 1:05:00.958
Secrets hurt after all, right?

1:05:01.041 --> 1:05:02.916
I think he wants to kill us.

1:05:03.666 --> 1:05:08.916
Oh, no, no. Not you per say,
but just people in general.

1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:11.750
I want to kill them, all of them.
Most of them.

1:05:12.333 --> 1:05:14.666
Whatever. Look, don't worry.
Once it gets rolling,

1:05:14.750 --> 1:05:16.875
thinks will be happening really quickly.

1:05:16.958 --> 1:05:19.916
Boom, boom, boom.
Trust me, it will be fine.

1:05:20.750 --> 1:05:23.083
[heavy whirring, beeping]

1:05:23.166 --> 1:05:24.916
[walls cracking]

1:05:29.416 --> 1:05:33.125
-Justin Pin's a bad guy?
-That explains a lot actually.

1:05:33.208 --> 1:05:36.500
[debris clattering, Momo barking]

1:05:37.791 --> 1:05:40.833
But he's messing
with the wrong cute little robot.

1:05:40.916 --> 1:05:43.833
-Blast them!
-I'm sorry, Mai. But I can't.

1:05:43.916 --> 1:05:45.166
-What?
-I--

1:05:45.250 --> 1:05:47.458
[groaning, blasting]

1:05:56.458 --> 1:05:59.250
-[swoosh]
-[Molly] Mai, what is going on here?

1:05:59.333 --> 1:06:00.333
[Mai screams]

1:06:02.458 --> 1:06:05.166
You know what? That is a great question.

1:06:05.250 --> 1:06:06.625
What is he doing?

1:06:15.416 --> 1:06:18.250
[Mai] Use your guns!
Use your plasma thingy.

1:06:18.375 --> 1:06:20.875
Get back, it's not safe.

1:06:24.333 --> 1:06:25.708
-Ah!
-[thud]

1:06:28.791 --> 1:06:29.666
Huh?

1:06:33.833 --> 1:06:34.791
[clank]

1:06:37.958 --> 1:06:39.375
[thump, 7723 groans]

1:06:39.458 --> 1:06:41.666
[Momo growls,  yips]

1:06:43.500 --> 1:06:45.500
-Uh-oh.
-Okay, fine.

1:06:48.125 --> 1:06:49.208
Who's dog is this?

1:06:51.458 --> 1:06:52.625
[Q-Bot] Hey, guys.

1:06:54.416 --> 1:06:58.083
Did he just explode? We gotta go back,
we gotta get mom.

1:06:59.541 --> 1:07:01.875
-[thump]
-[Momo barking]

1:07:02.958 --> 1:07:04.666
[swoosh]

1:07:06.500 --> 1:07:08.875
[ship whirring]

1:07:10.416 --> 1:07:11.791
-Mai!
-Mom.

1:07:11.875 --> 1:07:13.375
-Mom!
-[7723] No.

1:07:14.041 --> 1:07:14.958
[Molly] Mai!

1:07:16.083 --> 1:07:19.541
-[army robot] Surround the target.
-Why aren't you stopping to help her?

1:07:21.125 --> 1:07:22.000
Mai!

1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:23.833
No!

1:07:27.166 --> 1:07:28.125
No!

1:07:35.375 --> 1:07:36.541
[muffled explosion]

1:07:36.625 --> 1:07:38.541
[alarms blaring]

1:07:43.625 --> 1:07:44.791
[fire crackling]

1:07:50.041 --> 1:07:52.833
Wow, what a scuffle. It looks--

1:08:04.458 --> 1:08:06.166
[whirring in slow-motion]

1:08:12.250 --> 1:08:14.708
[powering down]

1:08:23.291 --> 1:08:25.041
-[blast]
-[Mai] Stop!

1:08:29.458 --> 1:08:32.458
Put me down! Stop, just stop!

1:08:32.541 --> 1:08:33.791
[water splashing]

1:08:35.875 --> 1:08:37.875
What is wrong with you?

1:08:37.958 --> 1:08:39.958
They took my mom!

1:08:40.041 --> 1:08:42.125
I'm sorry, I couldn't stop them.

1:08:42.208 --> 1:08:44.500
This is how you got my back?

1:08:45.333 --> 1:08:47.541
I thought you were some kind of superhero.

1:08:47.625 --> 1:08:51.291
But you just stood by
and let them take her.

1:08:51.375 --> 1:08:54.083
-You let them.
-I didn't let them.

1:08:54.500 --> 1:08:56.458
I had nothing to fight them with.

1:08:56.541 --> 1:08:59.375
-What?
-I deleted my weapon control systems.

1:09:00.583 --> 1:09:02.708
What? Why would you do that?

1:09:02.791 --> 1:09:04.541
Because I was out of memory.

1:09:04.625 --> 1:09:07.708
There was nothing I could delete
that wasn't you.

1:09:07.791 --> 1:09:11.708
Okay, so your precious robot memories

1:09:11.791 --> 1:09:16.291
are more important
than my mother's life? Is that it?

1:09:16.375 --> 1:09:18.041
Is that what you're saying?

1:09:18.125 --> 1:09:20.458
I hope that's not what you're saying.

1:09:21.500 --> 1:09:22.958
I know I messed up,

1:09:23.791 --> 1:09:26.916
but I had no choice. I had to save you.

1:09:27.250 --> 1:09:29.166
I can't lose you, Mai.

1:09:29.250 --> 1:09:31.375
My parents are gone.

1:09:31.958 --> 1:09:35.333
The second I believe
this thing between us is real

1:09:35.416 --> 1:09:38.833
you burn it down to the ground
like everyone else does!

1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:41.000
Look, remember this.

1:09:41.083 --> 1:09:43.291
I'm bailing first.

1:09:43.375 --> 1:09:44.416
[water splashing]

1:09:45.750 --> 1:09:46.958
[Mai crying]

1:10:10.708 --> 1:10:12.708
[metal scraping]

1:10:18.750 --> 1:10:20.833
[soft whirring]

1:10:30.666 --> 1:10:31.625
[thud]

1:10:32.458 --> 1:10:34.041
[robot vocalizing]

1:10:34.416 --> 1:10:35.708
[Mai groans]

1:10:36.333 --> 1:10:37.958
[thud, glass shattering]

1:10:38.041 --> 1:10:38.875
You okay, kiddo?

1:10:43.333 --> 1:10:44.875
[indistinct chatter]

1:11:01.166 --> 1:11:03.333
-I have you now, princess.
-No!

1:11:03.791 --> 1:11:06.833
-Get your hands off me.
-Okay, come on--

1:11:07.625 --> 1:11:10.375
Mai, don't do this by yourself.

1:11:10.458 --> 1:11:13.583
-I don't need you.
-Come on. Just listen to me.

1:11:13.666 --> 1:11:15.375
Hi, you are in violation--

1:11:16.416 --> 1:11:18.583
-Please stop fighting me.
-[robot] Huh.

1:11:19.416 --> 1:11:20.875
Mai, I'm trying to help.

1:11:20.958 --> 1:11:23.375
[sarcastically] Oh, good!
Weapons would help.

1:11:23.458 --> 1:11:25.791
Did you bring any weapons this time?

1:11:27.250 --> 1:11:29.583
-It doesn't work like that.
-I don't know about you,

1:11:29.666 --> 1:11:33.208
but a rocket launcher
would make me feel a whole lot better.

1:11:33.291 --> 1:11:35.500
[7723] If I brought my weapons
back online,

1:11:35.583 --> 1:11:38.125
the process would purge my entire memory.

1:11:38.208 --> 1:11:40.666
I'd forget everything I've ever learned.

1:11:40.750 --> 1:11:42.333
[sarcastically] Oh, real tragedy.

1:11:42.416 --> 1:11:46.416
-I wouldn't know who to fight anymore.
-Whatever, I can fight alone.

1:11:47.666 --> 1:11:51.166
-I've been doing it my whole life.
-You are not alone!

1:11:51.250 --> 1:11:54.083
I'm always alone. This time--

1:11:54.166 --> 1:11:56.125
-[sirens wailing]
-This time's no different.

1:11:56.208 --> 1:11:58.083
[security robot] You are now surrounded--

1:11:58.916 --> 1:12:01.041
[sirens wail in slow-motion]

1:12:03.166 --> 1:12:04.291
[groans]

1:12:04.375 --> 1:12:06.833
You're right. I let you down.

1:12:06.916 --> 1:12:10.250
A lot of people let you down,
but you are not alone.

1:12:11.166 --> 1:12:13.666
[Mai] If I'm not alone
that means I've brought you down

1:12:13.750 --> 1:12:15.291
into my garbage life.

1:12:15.375 --> 1:12:17.458
Is that really where you want to be?

1:12:19.250 --> 1:12:20.500
[7723] Nowhere else.

1:12:24.166 --> 1:12:25.166
[Mai sniffling]

1:12:25.791 --> 1:12:26.791
I miss him.

1:12:27.833 --> 1:12:29.041
Everyday.

1:12:29.583 --> 1:12:33.916
And everyday, I'm mad at him for leaving.

1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:36.250
[sobbing]

1:12:37.750 --> 1:12:38.666
Look at us.

1:12:39.125 --> 1:12:40.833
Quite a team we make--

1:12:40.916 --> 1:12:44.791
A broken robot and a broken little girl.

1:12:57.083 --> 1:12:59.583
It's more
than I could have ever asked for.

1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:09.541
What do you say we go
and get your mother? Together?

1:13:09.833 --> 1:13:12.916
We're going to get our butts kicked
without your weapons.

1:13:13.500 --> 1:13:16.750
-You know that, don't you?
-Oh, yeah for sure.

1:13:18.083 --> 1:13:20.875
[security robots] Violation. Alert. Alert.

1:13:20.958 --> 1:13:23.166

[robots gabble in confusion]

1:13:40.250 --> 1:13:41.791
Alert. Alert.

1:13:44.375 --> 1:13:47.583
-Hold up! You guys hear that?

1:13:47.666 --> 1:13:49.125
[barking]

1:13:49.208 --> 1:13:50.833
-Momo, shh!
-[7723] Wait.

1:13:50.916 --> 1:13:53.958
[sniffing, barking]

1:13:54.041 --> 1:13:56.833
-[Momo] She's that way!
-Momo said she's this way, come on.

1:13:57.333 --> 1:13:58.750
Wait, Momo says?

1:13:59.541 --> 1:14:00.500
"Momo says?"

1:14:00.583 --> 1:14:02.625
[muffled]

1:14:02.708 --> 1:14:05.083
I don't need that. I have a copy of that.

1:14:05.166 --> 1:14:08.208
All right, maybe I can try that.
Where did I see--

1:14:08.291 --> 1:14:11.625
Where did I put it, I know I--
I have money.

1:14:12.208 --> 1:14:15.416
Oh, you're here. We're saved!

1:14:16.250 --> 1:14:19.458
Hey, hey! Guys, wait. Oh, goodness.

1:14:22.250 --> 1:14:24.500
Where's my mom, nerd shirt?

1:14:25.083 --> 1:14:27.041
Ignore that, that's a trap.

1:14:27.125 --> 1:14:29.500
-There's no way I'll ignore that.
-No, listen.

1:14:29.583 --> 1:14:31.083
We can save your mother.

1:14:31.166 --> 1:14:34.750
We can save everybody,
but we have to stop Ares to do it.

1:14:34.833 --> 1:14:39.166
What? Who cares about Ares
if that Justin Pin guy is the problem?

1:14:39.250 --> 1:14:41.791
No, you don't understand. It's not Pin.

1:14:42.250 --> 1:14:43.125
He isn't...

1:14:43.875 --> 1:14:45.541
I mean he...

1:14:45.625 --> 1:14:49.083
He lost all patience
for tedious backstory?

1:14:49.166 --> 1:14:50.291
Yeah? [laughs]

1:14:50.375 --> 1:14:51.583
These guys again?

1:14:51.666 --> 1:14:54.458
I think that's just about enough,
Dr. Tanner Rice.

1:14:54.541 --> 1:14:56.875
Tell me where you're keeping my mother!

1:14:56.958 --> 1:14:59.791
Oh, right. The human woman. Oh my gosh.

1:14:59.875 --> 1:15:02.291
I had created
the perfect trap for you guys.

1:15:02.375 --> 1:15:03.583
-Hold up.
-What?

1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:06.708
What do you mean human woman?

1:15:06.791 --> 1:15:09.041
What? What do you mean, what do I mean?

1:15:09.125 --> 1:15:11.041
I mean, who talks like that?

1:15:12.083 --> 1:15:14.333
Normal humans do. [chuckles nervously]

1:15:14.416 --> 1:15:18.750
[stuttering] I mean, I do.
Because I do normal human things

1:15:18.833 --> 1:15:20.833
all the time. All the time.

1:15:20.916 --> 1:15:23.375
Literally, you could ask
any other human if I--

1:15:23.458 --> 1:15:26.375
You won't get away with this.
He can't hide forever.

1:15:26.916 --> 1:15:29.375
-You know, people will find out--
-[zapping]

1:15:29.458 --> 1:15:30.916
[Mai gasps, Momo whines]

1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:32.958
-You know what, never mind.
-No!

1:15:34.958 --> 1:15:37.625
[laser zapping]

1:15:38.666 --> 1:15:39.750
[Mai] No!

1:15:42.416 --> 1:15:45.458
[robot, low-pitched voice]
Now it's time to finish this.

1:15:45.541 --> 1:15:47.666
[flying robot] All right, Dr. Rice.
Time to go.

1:15:47.750 --> 1:15:50.083
You said two minutes,
it's been two minutes.

1:15:50.375 --> 1:15:51.666
Oh, hey Ares.

1:15:52.708 --> 1:15:53.666
[Mai] Nope.

1:17:24.916 --> 1:17:26.041
Oh, no!

1:17:30.958 --> 1:17:34.458
-[robot] So, then I go back and get him--
-[Mai] Go get the cops!

1:17:34.541 --> 1:17:38.916
But Dr. Rice is dead. I have
to take some time to process this.

1:17:39.333 --> 1:17:42.416
Okay, get the cops. Get the cops.

1:17:42.500 --> 1:17:45.083

1:18:03.791 --> 1:18:05.666
Oh, Mai. My baby!

1:18:05.750 --> 1:18:07.083
-Mom--
-I'm so sorry.

1:18:07.166 --> 1:18:09.666
I should've paid more attention.
You felt so all alone.

1:18:09.750 --> 1:18:12.250
I should've given you a hug,
but I was alone too

1:18:12.333 --> 1:18:15.375
and thought robots were my answer.
But you're my answer!

1:18:15.458 --> 1:18:19.250
I hope that I'm your answer.
You were so right and I was wrong.

1:18:19.333 --> 1:18:21.791
I love you so, so much!

1:18:21.875 --> 1:18:24.416
Wow, yeah. I love you too.

1:18:24.500 --> 1:18:27.166
But listen,
Pin wants to kill all these people

1:18:27.250 --> 1:18:29.250
you need to help me get them out of here.

1:18:30.166 --> 1:18:31.916
They're never going to believe you.

1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:36.416
I am a beloved public figure.

1:18:37.041 --> 1:18:39.416
And they do whatever I want them to.

1:18:40.041 --> 1:18:44.750
[echoing over P.A.] These morons
are lining up to pay for the bombs

1:18:44.833 --> 1:18:47.875
I'm going to use to kill--
Hold on, wait a second.

1:18:48.583 --> 1:18:49.583
Am I...

1:18:50.583 --> 1:18:52.041
Am I hearing an echo?

1:18:52.208 --> 1:18:55.291
Hello. Do you guys hear that?
Can anyone else hear an echo?

The Q-Bots are bombs!

1:19:17.041 --> 1:19:20.166
Head for the exits. Why is no one running?

1:19:20.541 --> 1:19:23.416
Run, right now! Get away while you can!

Aw!

1:19:59.333 --> 1:20:01.083
[thud, thump]

1:20:01.166 --> 1:20:05.541
Okay, fine! I killed Justin Pin
and stole his body.

1:20:06.250 --> 1:20:07.208
Boo!

1:20:08.333 --> 1:20:11.208
[Justin and Ares voices in unison]
"Boo-hoo!" Shut up!

1:20:11.291 --> 1:20:14.000
The guy's dead. Get over it!

1:20:14.083 --> 1:20:17.833
You know what he said to me?
"You're perfect," he said.

1:20:17.916 --> 1:20:20.000
"Now go make the world perfect."

1:20:20.083 --> 1:20:22.083
You want the world to be a better place?

1:20:22.166 --> 1:20:24.833
You humans are what's wrong with it.

1:20:24.916 --> 1:20:28.958
-You're flawed and you're broken.
-Keep talking, crazy pants.

1:20:29.041 --> 1:20:31.833
[Justin] The only way
this world gets perfect...

1:20:32.375 --> 1:20:34.500
is with all of you dead!

-[thud]
-[Mai groans]

1:20:37.541 --> 1:20:39.916
Maybe I'll start with killing this one?

1:20:40.750 --> 1:20:42.750
Get your hands off of her!

1:20:43.458 --> 1:20:46.333
Put your [bleep] finger on my daughter--

1:20:51.666 --> 1:20:52.791
[Momo barking excitedly]

1:20:52.875 --> 1:20:56.041
[Ares] I guess I don't have
to wear the man's suit anymore.

1:20:56.125 --> 1:20:59.333
Let's just scrub ahead
to the everyone dies part, shall we?

1:22:15.208 --> 1:22:17.541
Okay? I didn't mean
to hurt you or anybody.

1:22:17.625 --> 1:22:20.083
-And I know you weren't--
-Can we do this later?

1:22:20.166 --> 1:22:21.333

[Ares] You have been ruined
by that human child.

1:24:48.541 --> 1:24:52.541
Humans are the imperfection
I mean to correct.

You're as broken as they are.

But my world... My world will be perfect.
