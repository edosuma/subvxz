01:35.813 --> 01:37.021
Time?

01:37.023 --> 01:39.024
Ten past eleven.

01:49.911 --> 01:51.619
Excellent.

01:51.621 --> 01:56.456
Okay, Frank, can you tell me
what animal this is?

01:56.458 --> 01:57.834
It's a lion.

01:57.836 --> 01:59.626
Great. The next one?

01:59.628 --> 02:02.546
That is a hippopotamus.

02:02.548 --> 02:03.798
And the last one?

02:03.800 --> 02:05.674
That's a dog.

02:05.676 --> 02:07.595
Good.

02:08.762 --> 02:11.054
Frank, now I'm gonna read you
a list of five words.

02:11.056 --> 02:12.890
I want you to repeat them
back to me.

02:12.892 --> 02:15.059
In about five minutes,
I'll ask you to repeat

02:15.061 --> 02:18.186
the same five words,
as many as you can remember.

02:18.188 --> 02:20.273
Okay?

02:20.275 --> 02:21.606
Face.

02:21.608 --> 02:22.899
Velvet.

02:22.901 --> 02:24.444
Church.

02:24.446 --> 02:25.862
Daisy.

02:25.864 --> 02:27.529
Red.

02:27.531 --> 02:29.533
Can you repeat those for me?

02:32.704 --> 02:35.579
Face.

02:35.581 --> 02:37.500
Umm...

02:41.003 --> 02:42.670
I'm gonna read
you a list of numbers.

02:42.672 --> 02:44.589
I'd like you to repeat them.

02:44.591 --> 02:46.673
- Two.
- Two.

02:46.675 --> 02:50.470
That's a little quick there,
Frank, let me finish.

02:50.472 --> 02:52.804
Now, I'm gonna give you
one minute,

02:52.806 --> 02:54.140
to name all the words
you can think of

02:54.142 --> 02:56.017
that start with the letter F.

02:56.019 --> 02:57.309
But no names,

02:57.311 --> 03:00.438
so Frank, for example,
would be off limits.

03:00.440 --> 03:02.856
Ready?

03:02.858 --> 03:04.024
Go.

03:16.455 --> 03:19.874
Jesus,
why can't I think of anything?

03:19.876 --> 03:24.796
You still have lots of
time, just stay focused.

03:24.798 --> 03:28.259
Fish, fun, you said focused.

03:31.096 --> 03:32.928
Try not to get
frustrated, Frank.

03:32.930 --> 03:35.475
Frustrated Frank,
there's two more!

03:40.312 --> 03:42.357
Christ, I can't think
of anything!

03:44.775 --> 03:45.941
Fuck, fucking.

03:45.943 --> 03:47.487
Fucker!

03:52.116 --> 03:53.116
I'm sorry.

03:53.118 --> 03:55.284
I know that was difficult.

03:55.286 --> 03:58.997
It wasn't difficult,
I just couldn't think.

04:01.418 --> 04:02.958
Do you remember
when I asked you to remember

04:02.960 --> 04:04.668
those five words?

04:04.670 --> 04:06.879
The first one was a body part.

04:06.881 --> 04:11.551
Ironically it started
with the letter F.

04:11.553 --> 04:13.469
It was "face."

04:13.471 --> 04:15.723
Do you think
you might remember any others?

04:18.935 --> 04:20.687
No.

04:28.445 --> 04:30.321
Shit.

04:31.489 --> 04:32.989
Sorry,
caught with another patient.

04:32.991 --> 04:34.323
Nice to see you again Richie.

04:34.325 --> 04:35.365
You too.

04:35.367 --> 04:37.326
Everything okay over there?

04:37.328 --> 04:38.410
Yeah.

04:38.412 --> 04:39.538
Yeah, fine.

04:41.833 --> 04:46.376
So, how's your dad?

04:46.378 --> 04:47.627
You tell me.

04:47.629 --> 04:49.463
Well, if you recall
when you first brought him

04:49.465 --> 04:52.008
to me,
he was quite disoriented.

04:52.010 --> 04:53.843
At the time,
because of his condition,

04:53.845 --> 04:57.220
we were unable to adequately
assess Frank's cognition.

04:57.222 --> 04:59.766
But today, no delirium,
so I was able to conduct

04:59.768 --> 05:03.727
a more thorough assessment.

05:03.729 --> 05:05.021
It's a screening tool.

05:05.023 --> 05:09.400
Your father scored 18
out of 30.

05:09.402 --> 05:12.028
Okay, what does this all mean?

05:12.030 --> 05:15.198
Well, it very likely means
that your father

05:15.200 --> 05:18.033
has some mild
cognitive impairment.

05:18.035 --> 05:21.287
You might know it better
as dementia.

05:21.289 --> 05:24.040
Have you recognized
any of the symptoms at home?

05:24.042 --> 05:25.833
On examination
his short-term memory

05:25.835 --> 05:28.251
was particularly impaired.

05:28.253 --> 05:33.215
Yeah, no, I've noticed that,
but it's weird though...

05:33.217 --> 05:35.218
you know,
like he remembers old shit,

05:35.220 --> 05:38.095
like really old shit
from like 30 years ago,

05:38.097 --> 05:40.641
but then half the time
he doesn't recognize me.

05:45.938 --> 05:49.816
It's never easy watching time
take our parents away.

05:49.818 --> 05:52.193
Yeah.

05:52.195 --> 05:54.612
And it certainly doesn't
help that we don't know exactly

05:54.614 --> 05:57.075
when all this started.

05:59.869 --> 06:04.247
The prison, they still haven't
sent you any files?

06:04.249 --> 06:06.706
Quite frankly,
I'm not sure they kept any.

06:06.708 --> 06:09.251
Regardless, I wanna give you
some pamphlets,

06:09.253 --> 06:11.711
some tips and tricks
to keep his memory active.

06:11.713 --> 06:13.547
And there is some medication
we can try?

06:13.549 --> 06:15.090
Is it expensive?

06:15.092 --> 06:16.550
We can work out a plan.

06:16.552 --> 06:19.761
Also, you should know,
I have a legal obligation

06:19.763 --> 06:22.264
to report Frank to the DMV.

06:22.266 --> 06:24.307
With his impairment,
they won't let him reapply

06:24.309 --> 06:26.059
for a driver's license.

06:26.061 --> 06:28.228
Yeah.

06:28.230 --> 06:31.107
He won't be driving
any time soon.

06:38.825 --> 06:41.244
Who are you?

06:43.787 --> 06:45.831
I'm your son, Dad.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.137
Where'd you get that?

09:07.139 --> 09:09.766
Convenience store.

09:09.768 --> 09:11.601
How much?

09:11.603 --> 09:13.560
Barely enough
to keep the power on.

09:13.562 --> 09:15.896
They didn't have any cash.

09:15.898 --> 09:18.107
What do you mean
they didn't have any cash?

09:18.109 --> 09:19.567
It's a convenience store.

09:19.569 --> 09:22.152
Yeah, well apparently
everyone's paying with Visa now.

09:22.154 --> 09:24.738
What about the safe?

09:24.740 --> 09:25.573
What safe?

09:25.575 --> 09:27.449
Every store has a safe.

09:27.451 --> 09:28.617
So how come when I asked,

09:28.619 --> 09:30.118
you didn't tell me to look
for no safe?

09:30.120 --> 09:31.953
I got memory problems.

09:31.955 --> 09:33.580
Oh, memory problems?

09:33.582 --> 09:35.333
I guess that's also
why you forgot to mention

09:35.335 --> 09:37.459
these assholes
carry fuckin' shotguns?

09:38.963 --> 09:40.378
Jesus Christ.

09:40.380 --> 09:42.548
You wanna hear a hard truth?

09:42.550 --> 09:44.467
I take it I've heard it before?

09:44.469 --> 09:46.343
Many times.

09:46.345 --> 09:50.598
Maybe this one will sink in.

09:50.600 --> 09:53.601
The only reason I'm here,
is 'cause you've got 50 years

09:53.603 --> 09:55.310
of serious experience
floating around

09:55.312 --> 09:57.521
in that dyin' brain of yours...

09:57.523 --> 10:01.317
I need to use it
before you lose it.

10:01.319 --> 10:02.987
Why do you need it so badly?

10:05.657 --> 10:09.449
I'm in a hole.

10:09.451 --> 10:11.828
Well, how'd you get there?

10:11.830 --> 10:14.541
I'm pretty sure
I have a mental illness.

10:19.838 --> 10:21.128
How much?

10:21.130 --> 10:22.505
50.

10:22.507 --> 10:23.798
That's a decent hole.

10:23.800 --> 10:25.718
Yeah, no shit.

10:29.806 --> 10:31.597
When I was kid,
you would tell me

10:31.599 --> 10:35.559
about all this artwork you
and your partner stole.

10:35.561 --> 10:38.729
What happened to it?

10:38.731 --> 10:40.939
I moved it.

10:40.941 --> 10:42.357
All of it?

10:42.359 --> 10:45.113
Yeah.

10:53.955 --> 10:55.704
Scratch those for me.

10:55.706 --> 10:57.165
Why can't you scratch 'em?

10:57.167 --> 10:58.542
Just do it, okay?

11:06.341 --> 11:08.968
Maybe I'll try the bank.

11:08.970 --> 11:11.386
Well don't be a moron,
you can't rob a bank.

11:11.388 --> 11:12.554
They do it in the movies.

11:12.556 --> 11:13.848
They do it in the movies,

11:13.850 --> 11:15.766
they make video phone calls
in the movies,

11:15.768 --> 11:17.977
they... they pull casino heists
in the movies.

11:17.979 --> 11:20.898
Don't watch movies,
they're full of shit.

11:24.402 --> 11:26.569
Maybe I'll rob a bank.

11:26.571 --> 11:27.737
I've been in the joint
20 years,

11:27.739 --> 11:29.613
even I know that banks
have cameras

11:29.615 --> 11:32.492
and trackers and witnesses.

11:32.494 --> 11:34.285
And believe me,
you ain't outrunnin' the cops

11:34.287 --> 11:36.411
with that...
that shitbox you drive.

11:36.413 --> 11:37.747
You know that shitbox
is your car.

11:37.749 --> 11:38.790
Yeah, and there's a reason

11:38.792 --> 11:42.501
I never tried to rob a bank
with it!

11:42.503 --> 11:44.087
Get yourself
a decent getaway car

11:44.089 --> 11:46.338
and we'll talk.

11:46.340 --> 11:48.381
We?

11:48.383 --> 11:52.929
Like you said,
my brain is dying.

11:52.931 --> 11:55.892
Maybe I should use it
before I lose it.

11:59.019 --> 12:01.353
Were you packin' today?

12:11.490 --> 12:15.450
Jeez.

12:15.452 --> 12:16.912
Christ.

12:19.706 --> 12:23.710
You know maybe you should invest
in a real gun.

12:25.003 --> 12:26.712
I don't like guns.

12:26.714 --> 12:29.924
You know when my partner
and me were strapped,

12:29.926 --> 12:32.551
we'd look around at what
we had to work with,

12:32.553 --> 12:35.847
and we'd find
a creative solution.

12:35.849 --> 12:39.308
So find a creative solution.

12:39.310 --> 12:41.894
You won five bucks.

12:59.873 --> 13:02.832
Uhh... yeah, no, I've got
a headlight restoration,

13:02.834 --> 13:05.168
uhh, can you just hold on
a second?

13:05.170 --> 13:06.126
Hey.

13:06.128 --> 13:07.878
Hey!

13:08.797 --> 13:10.673
You're gonna ruin the thread.

13:10.675 --> 13:11.841
Look, I got
a headlight restoration

13:11.843 --> 13:13.425
and two interior shampoos
comin' in.

13:13.427 --> 13:15.303
You good for it?

13:15.305 --> 13:17.012
Questions?

13:17.014 --> 13:18.514
Can I get a raise?

13:18.516 --> 13:19.515
Would if I could.

13:19.517 --> 13:21.184
Lunch is on me
when you're done.

13:21.186 --> 13:22.559
Yeah, sorry.

13:22.561 --> 13:24.688
Tuesday, I can do Tuesday,
that's all.

13:33.406 --> 13:36.156
I wasn't joking by the way.

13:36.158 --> 13:40.745
I'd pay you more if I could,
I just, I can't.

13:40.747 --> 13:43.249
Ellie, don't worry about it.

13:45.710 --> 13:47.961
You in trouble again?

13:55.803 --> 13:58.679
See that kid over there?

13:58.681 --> 14:02.268
Everyday he just sits there,
waiting for his dealer.

14:04.186 --> 14:06.396
Buys those patches now,
you heard about this?

14:06.398 --> 14:07.688
Yeah, the painkiller stuff,
right?

14:07.690 --> 14:09.607
Oh man, it's nasty.

14:09.609 --> 14:11.317
Just roll 'em up, smoke 'em.

14:11.319 --> 14:14.237
Used to be needles,
now it's opium patches,

14:14.239 --> 14:16.155
God only knows what's next.

14:16.157 --> 14:19.282
I hear they're trying
to crack down on it in the city.

14:19.284 --> 14:20.910
Good for them.

14:20.912 --> 14:25.832
If it's not drugs it's booze,
if it's not booze it's cards,

14:25.834 --> 14:26.915
if it's not cards,

14:26.917 --> 14:30.877
well, then I guess
you're really screwed.

14:30.879 --> 14:32.796
Why don't the cops stop it?

14:36.510 --> 14:39.138
I haven't seen a cop
stop a crime out here in years.

14:40.348 --> 14:41.264
If you haven't figured out

14:41.266 --> 14:44.224
that this is a lawless,
Godless place yet,

14:44.226 --> 14:47.395
you're a lot slower
than I thought.

14:47.397 --> 14:49.023
Hey...

14:52.652 --> 14:53.693
I'm not slow.

15:00.744 --> 15:02.662
You sleepin' with anyone yet?

15:07.542 --> 15:09.835
Offer's still on the table,
baby.

16:11.439 --> 16:13.856
I bought
a scratch card last week.

16:13.858 --> 16:15.732
It was the first one
in three years.

16:17.070 --> 16:19.277
I know I should feel bad
about that,

16:19.279 --> 16:24.742
and I do, but I gotta tell you,
it felt pretty good.

16:24.744 --> 16:29.122
At least before I lost,
of course.

16:29.124 --> 16:32.083
But really...

16:32.085 --> 16:33.543
and you know
they don't make them

16:33.545 --> 16:34.584
the way they used to.

16:34.586 --> 16:35.795
You know
how you could scratch 'em

16:35.797 --> 16:38.881
on the bottom and find
the double triangles?

16:38.883 --> 16:40.882
God, I could go through 20
of those in an hour

16:40.884 --> 16:42.426
without having to find a bingo.

16:43.595 --> 16:44.679
So why do you think

16:44.681 --> 16:47.390
you might have purchased
the ticket?

16:47.392 --> 16:51.184
I mean, you've been in recovery
for a long time now, Gary.

16:51.186 --> 16:54.896
So what changed?

16:54.898 --> 17:00.152
I was just, you know,
I was in a store,

17:00.154 --> 17:04.656
I saw the card,
I got an itch.

17:04.657 --> 17:06.031
Hmm.

17:06.034 --> 17:08.117
And do you still
have that itch?

17:08.119 --> 17:09.369
Oh, no.

17:09.372 --> 17:10.663
I scratched that thing.

17:15.712 --> 17:19.880
Oh, wow, Silent Sam,
is tonight the night

17:19.882 --> 17:22.760
you finally open up to us?

17:29.266 --> 17:31.184
Okay.

17:31.186 --> 17:33.394
Moving on.

17:33.396 --> 17:35.982
Marjorie, welcome back.

17:43.947 --> 17:45.405
Can I get one of those?

17:45.407 --> 17:48.408
Sure.

17:48.410 --> 17:51.703
I'm Winona, by the way.

17:51.705 --> 17:54.331
Richie.

17:54.333 --> 17:56.501
I haven't seen you here before,
have I?

17:56.503 --> 17:59.753
No, but I look familiar, right?

17:59.755 --> 18:02.380
Casino.

18:02.382 --> 18:04.466
- Bartender.
- Bingo.

18:04.468 --> 18:05.760
So, where you been?

18:05.762 --> 18:08.553
Here.
I've been here.

18:08.555 --> 18:10.389
Three months sober.

18:10.391 --> 18:13.267
Oh wow, good for you.

18:13.269 --> 18:16.272
Does your sobriety apply
to alcohol too.

18:21.528 --> 18:23.319
I know what you're thinking.

18:23.321 --> 18:27.030
Indian with a gambling problem,
oldest story in the book.

18:27.032 --> 18:29.075
I wasn't thinking that.

18:29.077 --> 18:32.330
Most people who meet me are.

18:33.747 --> 18:35.039
Would you believe me
if I told you

18:35.041 --> 18:36.415
that I've been working there
for seven years,

18:36.417 --> 18:39.292
and I've never even played
a single hand of blackjack?

18:39.294 --> 18:40.711
Get out.

18:40.713 --> 18:41.921
Never even been tempted.

18:41.923 --> 18:44.965
So why go to the meetings?

18:44.967 --> 18:47.635
Starting to get tempted.

18:47.637 --> 18:51.055
Money's tight,
slots are bright.

18:51.057 --> 18:54.015
I figured I should stop
before I start.

18:54.017 --> 18:56.853
Why'd you go
to your first meeting?

18:56.855 --> 19:00.522
Money's tight,
slots are bright.

19:00.524 --> 19:03.443
Can't even ask for help
either, you know?

19:03.445 --> 19:06.529
Too embarrassing.

19:06.531 --> 19:08.740
You ever try?

19:08.742 --> 19:11.367
Father?
Mother?

19:11.369 --> 19:14.703
I have a very complicated
relationship with my father.

19:14.705 --> 19:16.541
That makes two of us.

19:19.711 --> 19:20.835
Hi.

19:20.837 --> 19:22.336
Hi.

19:22.338 --> 19:25.464
I saw you from across the bar,
and I needed to tell you,

19:25.466 --> 19:29.050
you have the most
beautiful eyes I've ever seen.

19:29.052 --> 19:31.678
- Thanks...
- No seriously...

19:31.680 --> 19:32.597
breathtaking.

19:32.599 --> 19:34.014
Hey, buddy.

19:34.016 --> 19:35.515
One sec, pal, we're talking.

19:35.517 --> 19:38.603
Look, I'm only in town
for a few more hours,

19:38.605 --> 19:44.733
and I was thinking,
I've never gone native before...

19:44.735 --> 19:45.902
What do you say?

19:45.904 --> 19:47.989
Pocahontas...

19:52.243 --> 19:55.161
If you don't fuck off
in the next five seconds,

19:55.163 --> 19:57.582
I'll cut off your scalp.

20:10.177 --> 20:13.178
Do you have to deal
with that a lot?

20:13.180 --> 20:14.931
Oh.

20:14.933 --> 20:18.184
More than anyone
probably should.

20:18.186 --> 20:20.811
Sorry, by the way,
just work stuff.

20:20.813 --> 20:24.440
Is uhh, is that the new one?

20:24.442 --> 20:25.774
This?

20:25.776 --> 20:30.488
No, I got it online,
got a pretty good deal actually.

20:30.490 --> 20:32.450
Nice.

20:34.535 --> 20:36.661
Tell you what,
why don't you give me

20:36.663 --> 20:40.580
your phone number,
maybe I'll call you sometime.

20:40.582 --> 20:43.000
I don't have one.

20:43.002 --> 20:44.126
You don't have a phone number?

20:44.128 --> 20:47.463
I don't have a phone.

20:47.465 --> 20:49.048
Wow.

20:49.050 --> 20:53.094
I'd saw the 21st century called,
but...

20:53.096 --> 20:55.137
But... I don't have a phone?

20:55.139 --> 20:56.305
You don't have a phone.

20:58.976 --> 21:01.144
Man, you should definitely
get one.

21:01.146 --> 21:02.603
Can't afford it.

21:02.605 --> 21:04.688
Hmm.

21:04.690 --> 21:06.982
So steal one.

21:13.824 --> 21:15.282
What the fuck is that thing?

21:15.284 --> 21:18.118
That, is a video
telephone call device.

21:18.120 --> 21:19.745
From the movies.

21:19.747 --> 21:22.080
Go ahead, flip it open.

21:22.082 --> 21:23.750
Where'd you get it?

21:23.752 --> 21:25.917
Stole it from some prick.

21:25.919 --> 21:27.377
You lifted this?

21:27.379 --> 21:28.212
Pretty much.

21:28.214 --> 21:31.382
What's with the red
fuckin' mask?

21:31.384 --> 21:33.467
Chad Sanders.

21:33.469 --> 21:36.136
It's like his parents knew
he'd be a douchebag.

21:36.138 --> 21:39.014
Lives in the suburbs,
40 minutes from here.

21:39.016 --> 21:40.558
It's talking to me.

21:40.560 --> 21:41.725
What is?

21:41.727 --> 21:47.022
It has words, no signal,
location services now disabled.

21:47.024 --> 21:49.024
- Oh, shit.
- What's wrong?

21:49.026 --> 21:50.526
- I forgot about GPS.
- What's GPS?

21:50.528 --> 21:51.735
I don't know
what it stands for,

21:51.737 --> 21:53.654
it's like satellites,
it tracks your location.

21:53.656 --> 21:54.530
And you brought it here?!

21:54.532 --> 21:56.156
I just need to stop it
from connecting.

21:56.158 --> 21:57.241
Well take the battery out.

21:57.243 --> 21:58.867
- You can't.
- What do you mean you can't?

21:58.869 --> 22:00.118
You can't,
they build it that way.

22:00.120 --> 22:01.203
They build it that way?!

22:01.205 --> 22:02.914
What did I just say?

22:02.916 --> 22:04.706
This stuff is beyond me.

22:04.708 --> 22:07.376
Well you better start learning,
because this...

22:07.378 --> 22:09.087
is our creative solution.

22:09.089 --> 22:10.171
These things?

22:10.173 --> 22:11.713
Think about it,
used electronics,

22:11.715 --> 22:13.174
it's a huge market.

22:13.176 --> 22:14.509
We scope out a house,

22:14.511 --> 22:16.969
you make sure
we have an entrance, an exit,

22:16.971 --> 22:18.303
you get in, you get out,
no trackers,

22:18.305 --> 22:20.306
no securities, nothing.

22:20.308 --> 22:22.099
Only one condition though.

22:22.101 --> 22:23.893
We only take from assholes.

22:23.895 --> 22:24.851
No convenience stores.

22:24.853 --> 22:26.145
No banks.

22:26.147 --> 22:27.730
We hit these privileged
motherfuckers

22:27.732 --> 22:31.149
and we make 'em pay.

22:31.151 --> 22:34.820
Okay, Robin Hood.

22:34.822 --> 22:37.072
Which asshole is first?

22:45.041 --> 22:47.750
Who are you?

22:47.752 --> 22:49.585
I'm your son.

22:49.587 --> 22:52.171
What do you want?

22:52.173 --> 22:55.135
I want you to help me
steal something.

23:01.850 --> 23:03.098
How do you get in?

23:03.100 --> 23:05.143
He leaves a spare key
under the doormat,

23:05.145 --> 23:07.310
I checked last night,
it's still there.

23:07.312 --> 23:08.771
And how do you get out?

23:08.773 --> 23:10.313
Back through the front door.

23:10.315 --> 23:11.523
And what are you grabbing?

23:11.525 --> 23:14.026
Laptops, tablets, cell phones.

23:14.028 --> 23:15.027
What else?

23:15.029 --> 23:16.111
Earrings.

23:16.113 --> 23:17.780
- What else?
- Jewelry.

23:17.782 --> 23:19.615
No, be specific.

23:19.617 --> 23:21.701
Umm...

23:21.703 --> 23:23.034
Come on, what else?

23:23.036 --> 23:24.619
Fuck, I don't remember, Frank.

23:24.621 --> 23:25.663
You know.

23:25.665 --> 23:26.664
Cash.

23:26.666 --> 23:27.790
Spare cash, right?

23:27.792 --> 23:28.790
Sorry.

23:28.792 --> 23:29.876
Cash.

23:29.878 --> 23:31.168
It's okay, it's okay.

23:31.170 --> 23:32.669
You'll be fine.

23:32.671 --> 23:34.463
Just focus.

23:34.465 --> 23:38.216
Get in, get out,
he'll never know you were there.

23:38.218 --> 23:39.801
Okay, I can do this.

23:39.803 --> 23:40.970
You can do this.

23:40.972 --> 23:44.057
Now put your mask on.

23:44.059 --> 23:45.640
Set your timer.

23:45.642 --> 23:49.020
You got five minutes
before my mind starts to go.

23:49.022 --> 23:52.231
Use it before we lose it.

23:52.233 --> 23:57.360
Hey, don't forget
your water gun.

23:57.362 --> 23:59.696
Frank, don't forget...

23:59.698 --> 24:01.824
just don't forget.

24:01.826 --> 24:03.701
Go.

24:03.703 --> 24:04.952
Go!

24:27.101 --> 24:29.018
Laptops, tablets, cell phones.

24:51.876 --> 24:53.792
Shh.

26:13.707 --> 26:15.082
Laptops, tablets, cell phones.

26:15.084 --> 26:17.042
Laptops, tablets, cell phones.

26:17.044 --> 26:18.712
Laptops, tablets, cell phones.

26:23.676 --> 26:25.092
Jesus Christ.

26:38.649 --> 26:40.066
Fuck.

26:40.068 --> 26:41.567
Laptops, tablets, cell phones.

26:41.569 --> 26:43.444
Laptops, tablets, cell phones.

26:53.872 --> 26:55.580
No, I'm telling you,
the people,

26:55.582 --> 26:57.502
it's fuckin' Hicksville
out there.

27:00.964 --> 27:05.174
Yeah, I called the cops,
they didn't do jack shit.

27:05.176 --> 27:08.301
Yeah, I bought a new one.

27:08.303 --> 27:10.013
Yep.

27:17.563 --> 27:21.482
Yeah, so there's this one chick,
she's like a six out here,

27:21.484 --> 27:25.861
easily a nine out there.

27:25.863 --> 27:28.196
Obviously.

27:28.198 --> 27:30.784
Wait you're telling me
you don't use a relative scale?

27:34.621 --> 27:36.791
Okay, cool, talk to you later.

27:50.722 --> 27:55.058
Babe, you left your hair dryer
in the kitchen again.

27:55.060 --> 27:58.226
Yeah, I don't know,
just get off this juice cleanse,

27:58.228 --> 27:59.980
it's making you nuts.

28:14.036 --> 28:15.869
Jesus!

28:25.590 --> 28:27.591
Sorry, I forgot.

28:32.847 --> 28:36.890
So, how much cash did we get?

28:36.892 --> 28:38.267
Oh, for fu...

28:49.488 --> 28:50.613
Next time leave it
in the bathroom

28:50.615 --> 28:52.322
where it belongs.

28:52.324 --> 28:53.866
Also, you bought
conventional mangos,

28:53.868 --> 28:55.742
we're an organic household.

28:55.744 --> 28:57.328
I can't deal
with Mexican pesticides,

28:57.330 --> 28:58.453
they make me nauseated.

28:58.455 --> 28:59.873
I hate...

29:06.004 --> 29:08.088
I'll call you back.

29:19.310 --> 29:21.394
Can I ask you a question?

29:21.396 --> 29:25.021
Why do we have to keep eating
the same shit for dinner?

29:25.023 --> 29:28.734
Oh, that you remember?

29:28.736 --> 29:30.819
I steal them, okay?

29:30.821 --> 29:32.821
Every day, I shove two of these
down my pants

29:32.823 --> 29:34.449
and I bruise the hell
out of my balls

29:34.451 --> 29:36.075
so we don't starve.

29:36.077 --> 29:40.829
You should be
a little more grateful.

29:44.334 --> 29:46.293
You shove 'em down...

29:49.090 --> 29:50.380
Where do you get 'em?

29:50.382 --> 29:51.799
I work at a garage.

29:51.801 --> 29:54.719
The owner, she has dogs
who guard the place at night,

29:54.721 --> 29:57.472
she feeds 'em this.

29:57.474 --> 30:01.099
I'll pay her back.

30:01.101 --> 30:03.854
Do you feel guilty
about taking them?

30:07.817 --> 30:10.233
Why don't you stop?

30:20.871 --> 30:23.039
Yo.

30:23.041 --> 30:26.000
Yo!

30:32.675 --> 30:35.550
The gun that won the West.

30:35.552 --> 30:39.513
1873 Winchester,
38-40 caliber.

30:40.641 --> 30:42.683
Lever action.

30:42.685 --> 30:47.105
Manufactured about 1905.

30:47.107 --> 30:48.108
Pow!

30:51.610 --> 30:53.569
And this baby.

30:53.571 --> 30:56.696
Single action army,
Colt 45.

31:04.623 --> 31:07.582
Now they're both
a little beat up,

31:07.584 --> 31:10.586
not priceless originals,

31:10.588 --> 31:12.879
but if you found
the right buyer,

31:12.881 --> 31:15.508
they'd be worth a few grand.

31:15.510 --> 31:18.263
Lord knows
I don't need 'em anymore.

31:19.347 --> 31:21.681
Where were these?

31:21.683 --> 31:24.015
I kept 'em under my bed.

31:24.017 --> 31:27.478
You been hiding anything else
from me?

31:27.480 --> 31:30.106
I'm not hiding anything
from you?

31:30.108 --> 31:31.609
No?

31:43.329 --> 31:45.579
Do they still work?

31:45.581 --> 31:47.708
Last time I used 'em they did.

31:48.834 --> 31:51.253
I don't have much ammo left.

31:53.298 --> 31:54.880
Alright.

31:54.882 --> 31:57.384
Keep these around
as a last resort.

31:59.471 --> 32:01.306
You're the boss.

32:17.155 --> 32:18.239
Psst.

32:19.491 --> 32:21.240
Hey, Darryl?

32:21.242 --> 32:23.158
Got the stuff?

32:23.160 --> 32:26.287
Stuff?

32:26.289 --> 32:27.288
This isn't a drug deal.

32:27.290 --> 32:28.748
Oh, come on, man.

32:28.750 --> 32:30.832
Two laptops, a tablet,
and a brand-new phone?

32:30.834 --> 32:32.001
You wanna know
the number one reason

32:32.003 --> 32:33.502
most people get caught
post-robbery?

32:33.504 --> 32:34.503
Huh?

32:34.505 --> 32:35.838
Stupidity.

32:35.840 --> 32:37.757
Let me ask you something,
how do you know I'm not a cop?

32:37.759 --> 32:40.425
Huh?
How do you know I'm not a cop?

32:40.427 --> 32:44.012
Oh, hello, Mr. Officer,
somebody just broke into my home

32:44.014 --> 32:47.183
and stole all this stuff,
this, this, and this.

32:47.185 --> 32:49.810
Oh, well, ma'am, let me just
check the internet for...

32:49.812 --> 32:51.104
well, what do you know?

32:51.106 --> 32:54.022
A brand-new ad for this, this,
and this.

32:54.024 --> 32:55.066
We'll have him arrested

32:55.068 --> 32:58.944
and brought in right away,
Stupid.

32:58.946 --> 33:00.695
For the record, I'm not a cop.

33:00.697 --> 33:01.864
I hate 'em, hate cops.

33:01.866 --> 33:03.532
But you're lucky
I found that ad when I did,

33:03.534 --> 33:05.201
I deleted it for you.

33:05.203 --> 33:07.703
How?

33:07.705 --> 33:11.581
Next time you make an account,

33:11.583 --> 33:13.667
don't make the password
"password".

33:13.669 --> 33:14.876
And don't use
the library computers, man,

33:14.878 --> 33:17.088
they're so easy to track.

33:17.090 --> 33:19.714
Hey, everyone starts somewhere,

33:19.716 --> 33:23.095
and like I said
you're a lucky guy.

33:29.601 --> 33:31.186
I panicked a little.

33:34.064 --> 33:35.690
Okay.

33:35.692 --> 33:37.567
Oh.

33:37.569 --> 33:41.570
Panicked a lot...

33:44.908 --> 33:47.117
Ah.

33:47.119 --> 33:48.118
Here we go.

33:48.120 --> 33:49.995
This is by far the most
valuable thing you took.

33:49.997 --> 33:51.748
This is worth a lot of money
today, you know that?

33:51.750 --> 33:53.249
I'd rather not.

33:53.251 --> 33:54.709
Oh, you'd rather not contribute
to the county's drug problem?

33:54.711 --> 33:56.210
Aww.

33:56.212 --> 33:58.128
That's great, man,
sounds great on paper,

33:58.130 --> 34:00.589
but you wouldn't have taken
these otherwise, right?

34:00.591 --> 34:04.469
You know, sometimes the price
of poverty is a conscience.

34:04.471 --> 34:06.848
Lose the guilt, lose the debt,
simple as that.

34:08.099 --> 34:09.264
Anyway,
this is a pretty good take,

34:09.266 --> 34:12.350
I'd say around three,
four grand.

34:12.351 --> 34:13.268
You serious?

34:13.271 --> 34:15.145
I'll tell you
what I can do for you.

34:15.147 --> 34:17.190
I'll wipe everything,
factory reset everything,

34:17.192 --> 34:20.442
I've got an electronics guy,
a jewelry guy, many drugs guys.

34:20.444 --> 34:21.277
Why don't we meet back here

34:21.279 --> 34:22.737
after you find another prick
to rob

34:22.739 --> 34:23.862
and then you bring
the new batch,

34:23.864 --> 34:24.947
I'll give you the cash,

34:24.949 --> 34:28.659
and we'll get the ball rolling,
huh?

34:28.661 --> 34:30.453
- How do I-uhh...
- 10%.

34:30.455 --> 34:33.038
Yeah, 10%, I'll give you
the same as everybody else.

34:33.040 --> 34:34.331
I don't ask questions,
I don't name names,

34:34.333 --> 34:38.585
whatever the job is,
if there's money, I'm in.

34:38.587 --> 34:40.630
Fair?

34:40.632 --> 34:42.380
Alrighty then.

34:42.382 --> 34:43.551
Put 'er there partner.

34:45.636 --> 34:47.427
Yeah.

34:47.429 --> 34:48.429
Nice.

34:48.431 --> 34:49.931
Can I keep the bag?

34:56.438 --> 34:58.855
I'm gonna read
you a list of five words,

34:58.857 --> 35:01.442
and I want you to repeat them
back to me.

35:01.444 --> 35:02.485
Ready?

35:02.487 --> 35:03.652
Face.

35:03.654 --> 35:04.820
Velvet.

35:04.822 --> 35:06.322
Church.

35:06.324 --> 35:07.489
Daisy.

35:07.491 --> 35:08.907
Red.

35:08.909 --> 35:10.534
Now I'm gonna ask you
to repeat those words again

35:10.536 --> 35:11.494
to me in five minutes,

35:11.496 --> 35:14.496
and we'll see
how many you can remember.

35:14.498 --> 35:15.915
Okay?

35:15.917 --> 35:16.998
What are you grabbing?

35:17.000 --> 35:18.708
Laptops, tablets, cell phones.

35:18.710 --> 35:20.168
Jewelry, drugs.

35:20.170 --> 35:21.839
- What else?
- Cash.

35:23.757 --> 35:25.007
Thatta boy.

35:25.009 --> 35:27.175
Five minutes on the clock.

35:27.177 --> 35:28.761
Face, Velvet,
Church Daisy, Red?

35:28.763 --> 35:31.516
Face, Velvet,
Church, Daisy, Red!

35:32.641 --> 35:34.516
Hi, everyone.

35:34.518 --> 35:36.936
I'm Winona.

35:36.938 --> 35:41.023
Some of you might recognize me
from the casino bar.

35:41.025 --> 35:44.028
Don't worry,
I won't rat any of you out.

35:48.532 --> 35:50.157
What do you think?

35:50.159 --> 35:51.284
I'm thinkin'
I'm gonna have to start

35:51.286 --> 35:53.371
charging you a whole lot more
than 10%.

35:57.833 --> 36:02.210
I played my first slot machine
last night.

36:02.212 --> 36:07.382
I sat there for three hours,
just couldn't stop.

36:07.384 --> 36:10.177
You know after all these years
of watching gamblers,

36:10.179 --> 36:13.973
I think I finally understand
the appeal.

36:13.975 --> 36:16.726
It's the rush, right?

36:16.728 --> 36:18.603
It's almost like...

36:18.605 --> 36:21.313
committing a crime.

36:21.315 --> 36:23.565
Remember those five words
we talked about?

36:23.567 --> 36:26.652
First one starts with an F.

36:26.654 --> 36:28.820
Face.

36:28.822 --> 36:31.239
Velvet.

36:31.241 --> 36:33.284
Church.

36:33.286 --> 36:34.744
Daisy.

36:42.878 --> 36:44.380
Red.

36:52.846 --> 36:55.973
So, you still playing
those slots?

36:55.975 --> 36:57.599
Maybe.

36:57.601 --> 36:59.768
You should know better.

36:59.770 --> 37:01.770
You're one to talk.

37:01.772 --> 37:03.438
I'm clean.

37:03.440 --> 37:05.400
Are you?

37:05.402 --> 37:08.277
Have you seen me at the casino?

37:08.279 --> 37:09.570
Not going to the casino
doesn't mean

37:09.572 --> 37:11.157
you're not in trouble.

37:16.538 --> 37:18.286
I'm clean, Winona.

37:18.288 --> 37:19.663
I swear.

37:24.628 --> 37:25.795
Okay, fine.

37:25.797 --> 37:27.424
I believe you.

37:28.715 --> 37:30.757
How's your dad?

37:30.759 --> 37:32.634
Better actually.

37:32.636 --> 37:34.177
I don't know,
it might just be the meds,

37:34.179 --> 37:37.098
but I've been keeping him
more active.

37:37.100 --> 37:38.516
Doing stuff he loves to do.

37:41.813 --> 37:43.103
Wee!

37:43.105 --> 37:46.190
All he used to do was eat,
sleep, and shit all day.

37:46.192 --> 37:48.442
Sounds like Winston.

37:48.444 --> 37:49.694
Winston?

37:49.696 --> 37:52.070
My German Shepherd.

37:52.072 --> 37:54.824
You ever have a dog?

37:54.826 --> 37:57.159
It's like having a kid.

37:57.161 --> 37:58.703
I'm telling you, I care more
about that animal

37:58.705 --> 38:01.079
than I do most people.

38:01.081 --> 38:03.623
I would do anything
for that guy.

38:03.625 --> 38:06.126
You should come meet him.

38:06.128 --> 38:12.215
Yeah, umm, I work a lot,
I never know my schedule.

38:12.217 --> 38:15.011
I never lock my door.

38:19.433 --> 38:22.018
Can I tell you something crazy?

38:22.020 --> 38:24.436
I hit the jackpot
the other night.

38:24.438 --> 38:27.023
Five grand.

38:27.025 --> 38:28.733
Slots?

38:28.735 --> 38:29.692
You're kidding.

38:29.694 --> 38:30.692
Uh-Uh.

38:30.694 --> 38:33.070
Holy shit.

38:33.072 --> 38:34.279
Pretty wild, huh?

38:34.281 --> 38:35.822
You play slot machines
for a month,

38:35.824 --> 38:38.366
and you win the $5,000 jackpot?

38:38.368 --> 38:41.036
Beginner's luck, I guess.

38:41.038 --> 38:43.373
Next round's on me.

38:57.846 --> 39:01.224
I have an opening at 03:30,
and then another one at 05:00.

39:01.226 --> 39:03.311
Yeah, no,
we're closed after that.

39:09.567 --> 39:12.360
Uhh, tomorrow, yeah,
just let me have a look.

39:12.362 --> 39:16.154
I have a 02:00, 02:30...

39:16.156 --> 39:17.699
you know what,
I'm gonna have to call you back.

39:24.248 --> 39:25.542
Can you hold this for me?

39:33.174 --> 39:35.217
Can I help you gentlemen?

39:38.346 --> 39:40.846
That's Little Red.

39:40.848 --> 39:43.349
He's not so little anymore.

39:43.351 --> 39:45.311
You remember Little Red,
don't you?

39:48.188 --> 39:49.355
And what about me?

39:49.357 --> 39:50.859
Do you remember me?

39:52.902 --> 39:56.070
Hmm?

39:56.072 --> 39:58.072
And what's my name?

39:58.074 --> 40:00.449
Your name is Jim.

40:00.451 --> 40:01.453
Good.

40:08.585 --> 40:13.087
Would you hold that for me,
sweetheart?

40:13.089 --> 40:14.797
No.

40:14.799 --> 40:16.965
I just thought it might
make you a bit more comfortable.

40:16.967 --> 40:21.094
I'd be more comfortable
if you left my property.

40:21.096 --> 40:23.514
Fair enough.

40:23.516 --> 40:25.724
We're not gonna be here long.

40:37.489 --> 40:41.909
Please be aware that
these are her words, not mine.

40:44.913 --> 40:46.790
"Dear Robbie...

40:50.293 --> 40:51.666
It warms my heart to see you

40:51.668 --> 40:54.587
attempting to make
an honest living.

40:54.589 --> 40:56.672
I take no issue with you
stocking shelves

40:56.674 --> 41:01.636
or changing tires,
I do, however, have a problem

41:01.638 --> 41:06.349
with some of your new
extracurricular activities.

41:06.351 --> 41:08.183
As I'm sure you know,

41:08.185 --> 41:12.231
I'm involved in a variety
of different fis..."

41:14.275 --> 41:16.400
- Fiscal.
- Fiscal.

41:16.402 --> 41:18.527
"Different fiscal ventures.

41:18.529 --> 41:20.237
And over the last few weeks

41:20.239 --> 41:24.491
you have begun to cannibalize
one of them."

41:24.493 --> 41:27.619
She has such a way
with words, huh?

41:27.621 --> 41:30.956
Cannibalize.

41:30.958 --> 41:33.793
"I have no doubt that your heart
is in the right place,

41:33.795 --> 41:36.212
but I can no longer allow this
to happen,

41:36.214 --> 41:39.674
and it's time for us
to talk again...

41:39.676 --> 41:41.344
in person.

41:43.804 --> 41:47.139
I look forward
to seeing you shortly.

41:47.141 --> 41:51.686
Lots of love, hugs and kisses"

41:54.065 --> 41:58.233
"XOXO, Roxanne."

42:04.909 --> 42:08.705
You got a car, is that correct,
shitbird?

42:13.042 --> 42:14.833
Good.

42:25.764 --> 42:28.308
This is a real fuckin'
piece of shit.

42:31.310 --> 42:33.353
This must be killing you, huh?

42:34.605 --> 42:37.357
It's like an alcoholic,
going to an open bar.

42:40.402 --> 42:41.360
Can you hear 'em yet?

42:41.362 --> 42:43.820
The bells, the slots.

42:43.822 --> 42:47.282
Ping, ping, ping, ping,
ping, ping...

42:47.284 --> 42:49.326
Yeah, you can taste it.

42:49.328 --> 42:51.955
Ping, ping, ping,
ping, ping, ping...

42:55.043 --> 42:57.751
You are a fuckin' junkie.

43:27.157 --> 43:28.909
Sorry for the noise.

43:31.161 --> 43:32.955
I'm remodeling.

43:40.087 --> 43:42.005
Robbie.

43:44.801 --> 43:47.717
How are you?

43:47.719 --> 43:50.012
I'm okay.

43:50.014 --> 43:52.849
Just okay?

43:52.851 --> 43:54.349
From what I hear,
you're doing pretty well

43:54.351 --> 43:58.020
for yourself these days.

43:58.022 --> 44:02.190
Two jobs, a car...

44:02.192 --> 44:05.527
I take it you're not living
on the street anymore?

44:05.529 --> 44:08.530
I found some place to stay.

44:08.532 --> 44:12.659
Good for you.

44:12.661 --> 44:16.538
Though I have to say,
you never struck me as someone

44:16.540 --> 44:18.959
to get involved
in the drug trade.

44:20.335 --> 44:22.712
Yeah, well, I didn't intend to.

44:25.257 --> 44:28.134
Nobody ever intends to.

44:28.136 --> 44:31.887
We go where the money flows.

44:31.889 --> 44:36.935
And right now, my river
is running a little dry.

44:42.567 --> 44:44.733
I have no reason to give a shit
about the electronics,

44:44.735 --> 44:48.404
or the jewelry,
but I have every reason

44:48.406 --> 44:51.407
to give a shit about the drugs.

44:51.409 --> 44:56.329
Out here,
drugs are my territory.

44:56.331 --> 44:59.831
Just like every money grab
on the other side of that door.

45:08.592 --> 45:10.134
What?
Did you think that this shithole

45:10.136 --> 45:12.969
was government approved?

45:12.971 --> 45:14.596
No.

45:14.598 --> 45:18.934
No, this is my world.

45:18.936 --> 45:20.436
I run the game,
I make the rules,

45:20.438 --> 45:22.980
and as far as I'm concerned...

45:22.982 --> 45:25.148
Any drug money
you put in your pocket

45:25.150 --> 45:29.195
was stolen directly from mine.

45:29.197 --> 45:33.991
I will not allow you to pay me
back with my own cash.

45:33.993 --> 45:37.954
You've already tried that
before.

45:37.956 --> 45:42.125
I suppose in another world,
it would be a privilege

45:42.127 --> 45:46.753
to watch a young man grow up,
but in our case,

45:46.755 --> 45:49.634
it's been more of a tragedy,
wouldn't you say?

45:52.052 --> 45:55.554
Look at me.

45:55.556 --> 45:57.306
I want you to know,
I don't blame you

45:57.308 --> 46:00.183
for coming here all these years.

46:00.185 --> 46:02.978
Sweetie, when I look at you,
I see a little boy,

46:02.980 --> 46:06.773
grew up in a cesspool
of addicts.

46:06.775 --> 46:11.572
Addiction writes cheques
we cannot cash.

46:14.324 --> 46:16.953
You have an awful disease.

46:19.538 --> 46:22.165
But a very profitable one.

46:29.674 --> 46:33.425
I've been working
on my will lately.

46:33.427 --> 46:35.636
I wouldn't expect you
to empathize,

46:35.638 --> 46:37.721
you have nothing
to leave behind,

46:37.723 --> 46:42.684
but for somebody like me...

46:42.686 --> 46:45.980
I've been experiencing
something called

46:45.982 --> 46:51.819
recurrent malignant
pleural effusions.

46:51.821 --> 46:53.862
Fluid builds up
inside my lungs,

46:53.864 --> 46:58.701
essentially suffocating me
from the inside.

46:58.703 --> 47:00.953
Incredible, isn't it?

47:00.955 --> 47:04.873
The human body reduced
to a clog toilet

47:04.875 --> 47:07.043
in need of some plumbing.

47:11.049 --> 47:14.717
This is what happens to us
when we get old, Robbie.

47:14.719 --> 47:16.384
I don't care
if you're a billionaire

47:16.386 --> 47:18.637
or a bum...

47:18.639 --> 47:24.228
Time steals everything,
leaves you with nothing.

47:27.690 --> 47:30.565
It's a scary thing though,
you know?

47:30.567 --> 47:33.571
Realizing that my bones
aren't worth shit.

47:38.243 --> 47:41.744
Honey...

47:41.746 --> 47:47.416
You have sticky fingers.

47:47.418 --> 47:49.920
I need to take them.

47:52.714 --> 47:56.007
What?

47:56.009 --> 47:57.009
No, Roxanne.

47:57.011 --> 47:58.427
No, no...

48:16.864 --> 48:20.366
The mechanic is first.

48:20.368 --> 48:23.578
Then the support group.

48:23.580 --> 48:26.329
Then you.

48:26.331 --> 48:28.083
Okay, sweetie?

48:30.127 --> 48:33.046
Ahh!

48:54.277 --> 48:56.485
You have one week.

49:38.529 --> 49:41.279
So this is where you been?

49:41.281 --> 49:44.282
Hiding out in the woods?

49:44.284 --> 49:46.119
I guess that makes sense.

49:46.121 --> 49:48.329
You can't hear the slots
out here.

49:48.331 --> 49:50.873
Ping, ping, ping...

49:50.875 --> 49:53.041
You're not too bright,
are you?

49:53.043 --> 49:56.045
You could've brought me
into town,

49:56.047 --> 49:58.297
somewhere public,
lots of witnesses...

50:11.645 --> 50:13.061
Ahh!

50:13.063 --> 50:14.813
Jimmy told me to
leave you alone this week,

50:14.815 --> 50:18.483
but you know me,
I can't help kicking a dog

50:18.485 --> 50:19.444
when he's down.

50:21.656 --> 50:24.449
Roxy took it easy on you.

50:25.743 --> 50:29.328
Lots of people survive
with only eight fingers.

50:29.330 --> 50:31.288
I'm gonna take something
a little more permanent.

51:23.426 --> 51:27.094
You know, my partner never
got used to it.

51:27.096 --> 51:29.514
Every Sunday
he'd go to Church,

51:29.516 --> 51:32.143
even if we hadn't pulled a job
in months...

51:33.853 --> 51:36.815
And he'd beg for forgiveness.

51:39.817 --> 51:42.485
Kentucky Straight.

51:42.487 --> 51:44.197
That's my church.

51:50.744 --> 51:52.830
What happened to your partner?

51:56.625 --> 51:59.043
I killed him.

51:59.045 --> 52:01.628
Why?

52:01.630 --> 52:02.630
We don't need to talk about...

52:02.632 --> 52:03.505
Yes, we do.

52:03.507 --> 52:05.007
Why?

52:05.009 --> 52:07.634
Why'd you kill him?

52:07.636 --> 52:10.096
He got reckless.

52:10.098 --> 52:12.181
It was a liability
to let him live.

52:12.183 --> 52:14.641
Yeah, well,
you went to jail anyway.

52:14.643 --> 52:17.978
For theft, nothing more.

52:17.980 --> 52:22.650
20 years in a cell
versus 20 seconds in the chair,

52:22.652 --> 52:25.071
that choice was real simple.

52:29.951 --> 52:34.704
Do you regret it?

52:34.706 --> 52:38.416
All my life...

52:38.418 --> 52:41.918
All I ever did was take.

52:41.920 --> 52:46.465
Now all I've got left
is the past.

52:46.467 --> 52:48.592
Funny how that works.

53:03.150 --> 53:05.400
What was he like?

53:05.402 --> 53:07.110
Who?

53:07.112 --> 53:09.614
Your partner.

53:18.165 --> 53:20.583
Who are you?

53:31.386 --> 53:32.929
I just
wish someone could tell me

53:32.931 --> 53:35.764
why I keep coming back.

53:35.766 --> 53:37.308
I know I shouldn't.

53:37.310 --> 53:39.436
I know it only causes me pain.

53:43.817 --> 53:47.362
But I just,
I just can't let go.

53:51.449 --> 53:55.826
Gary, every gambler
who has ever lived

53:55.828 --> 53:58.579
has been exactly
where you are right now.

53:58.581 --> 54:00.956
And it is crucial for you
to remember

54:00.958 --> 54:03.083
that you are not alone...

54:03.085 --> 54:04.876
Hey, you're not alone,

54:04.878 --> 54:08.549
and you are worthy
of forgiveness.

54:13.513 --> 54:15.762
Can I say something?

54:15.764 --> 54:17.058
Of course.

54:21.603 --> 54:25.148
I used to play blackjack.

54:25.150 --> 54:30.069
I haven't played
in over 100 days now.

54:30.071 --> 54:31.904
That's great.

54:31.906 --> 54:35.324
Is it?

54:35.326 --> 54:40.496
I have this goal, you know...

54:40.498 --> 54:47.545
It's the reason
why I do everything, and, but...

54:47.547 --> 54:53.050
If I achieve it...

54:53.052 --> 54:57.724
If I achieve it,
what do I have left?

55:04.480 --> 55:07.607
Do you ever wonder
why gold medal athletes

55:07.609 --> 55:10.192
return to the Olympics?

55:10.194 --> 55:12.737
I mean they're not paid well
to be there,

55:12.739 --> 55:17.282
and they certainly already
achieved their goal.

55:17.284 --> 55:21.411
Sometimes accomplishments
can leave us feeling empty,

55:21.413 --> 55:24.290
when we should be feeling proud,

55:24.292 --> 55:27.460
and if you think that
that might happen to you,

55:27.462 --> 55:31.755
then I advise you
to set another goal.

55:31.757 --> 55:34.092
You know, even if it's just
something small.

55:34.094 --> 55:39.429
Just find it, set it,
achieve it.

55:39.431 --> 55:44.059
And you just do it again,
and again,

55:44.061 --> 55:46.813
and before you know it,

55:46.815 --> 55:50.483
you're not setting goals
anymore,

55:50.485 --> 55:54.904
you're just living your life.

55:54.906 --> 55:56.824
Yeah.

56:01.413 --> 56:04.663
I need you to
help me kidnap a dog.

56:04.665 --> 56:06.623
Excuse me?

56:06.625 --> 56:09.543
I have a friend,
and she just won a lot of money,

56:09.545 --> 56:13.005
and I know for a fact
she would pay a ransom.

56:13.007 --> 56:14.674
You would do that to a friend?

56:14.676 --> 56:16.550
I'm not gonna hurt the
dog, alright?

56:16.552 --> 56:19.719
And I'll pay her back,
every penny.

56:19.721 --> 56:21.596
You need to take a
deep breath and think about

56:21.598 --> 56:24.766
what you're asking yourself
to do.

56:24.768 --> 56:26.184
I mean have you got a plan?

56:26.186 --> 56:29.105
A strategy?

56:29.107 --> 56:31.398
I'm not in this hole alone
anymore, Frank.

56:31.400 --> 56:33.275
And they're gonna kill them.

56:33.277 --> 56:36.654
You gonna help me or not?

56:36.656 --> 56:39.741
You know, this kind of behavior
is not gonna save any lives,

56:39.743 --> 56:41.828
it's gonna end them.

56:47.792 --> 56:49.335
You finished it.

56:54.339 --> 56:56.382
Yeah, what do you think?

56:56.384 --> 56:58.469
Does it remind you of anything?

57:01.806 --> 57:03.723
Should it?

57:15.612 --> 57:17.487
You should come meet him.

57:17.489 --> 57:20.864
I work a lot,
I never know my schedule.

57:20.866 --> 57:22.616
I never lock my door.

59:28.578 --> 59:32.998
I wanted to run,
but I didn't know where to go.

59:37.170 --> 59:40.212
I never knew where he lived.

59:40.214 --> 59:43.800
I didn't even know he was out.

59:43.802 --> 59:47.427
I wanted to kill him
right there.

59:47.429 --> 59:50.306
But then...

59:50.308 --> 59:52.433
He called me "Richie."

01:00:01.319 --> 01:00:04.570
I thought
maybe he could help me,

01:00:04.572 --> 01:00:08.074
so I played along.

01:00:08.076 --> 01:00:10.453
I pretended to be his son.

01:00:15.125 --> 01:00:18.375
I didn't know
he had a daughter.

01:00:18.377 --> 01:00:19.962
Neither does he.

01:00:21.755 --> 01:00:24.674
You know, after Frank got out,

01:00:24.676 --> 01:00:26.634
it took me three months
to muster up the courage

01:00:26.636 --> 01:00:29.512
to finally go and meet him.

01:00:29.514 --> 01:00:33.349
Only he wasn't there.

01:00:33.351 --> 01:00:39.020
Imagine my surprise,
to find this instead.

01:00:39.022 --> 01:00:43.942
This doesn't really look like
my little half-brother.

01:00:43.944 --> 01:00:47.362
You've been planning this
for a while.

01:00:47.364 --> 01:00:50.032
I take it you don't have
a gambling problem?

01:00:50.034 --> 01:00:53.161
Or a dog?

01:00:53.163 --> 01:00:55.329
Why the act?

01:00:55.331 --> 01:00:57.706
Why not just invite me
over here day one?

01:00:57.708 --> 01:01:03.128
I wanted to get to know
who I was dealing with.

01:01:03.130 --> 01:01:05.884
Luckily, he turned out to be
a bit of an idiot.

01:01:15.185 --> 01:01:19.561
That goal you were talking
about at the meeting...

01:01:19.563 --> 01:01:22.648
You really do plan to kill him.

01:01:22.650 --> 01:01:25.108
Why?

01:01:25.110 --> 01:01:29.489
He murdered my dad.

01:01:29.491 --> 01:01:31.574
I'm sorry.

01:01:31.576 --> 01:01:37.788
Yeah, well he probably
deserved it, but still.

01:01:37.790 --> 01:01:42.293
How can you live with him?

01:01:42.295 --> 01:01:45.295
You talk to him,
you take care of him.

01:01:45.297 --> 01:01:48.590
Like I said, I need his help.

01:01:56.893 --> 01:02:01.270
Did she do that?

01:02:01.272 --> 01:02:02.940
To your fingers?

01:02:05.025 --> 01:02:07.821
Do you know
what she did to Richie?

01:02:09.822 --> 01:02:14.491
What she made him do to himself?

01:02:14.493 --> 01:02:17.036
Do you have any idea
how much her family

01:02:17.038 --> 01:02:20.958
has taken from my people?

01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:33.344
Robbie, I know...
I know revenge.

01:02:33.346 --> 01:02:37.389
I'm addicted to it,
just like you.

01:02:37.391 --> 01:02:38.641
And that's why
I don't believe you

01:02:38.643 --> 01:02:41.309
when you tell me
that you let Frank live

01:02:41.311 --> 01:02:44.813
because you needed his help.

01:02:44.815 --> 01:02:49.152
There's a reason
you tolerate his existence.

01:02:49.154 --> 01:02:53.864
Otherwise, you would've killed
that first day you found him.

01:02:53.866 --> 01:02:56.118
I would've.

01:02:59.621 --> 01:03:03.877
Where did you get that?

01:03:07.505 --> 01:03:09.838
My mom left it to me
with the house.

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:10.882
Why?

01:03:10.884 --> 01:03:13.675
Do you know where she got it?

01:03:13.677 --> 01:03:17.679
She got it from Frank.

01:03:17.681 --> 01:03:22.226
How do you know that?

01:03:22.228 --> 01:03:25.145
Because it's mine.

01:03:25.147 --> 01:03:28.148
He took it from my house
the night he shot my dad

01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:31.111
in front of me.

01:03:38.453 --> 01:03:41.246
Why do you tolerate
Roxanne's existence?

01:03:43.290 --> 01:03:45.667
Can I answer your
question with a question?

01:03:49.255 --> 01:03:51.925
Will you help me
steal something?

01:04:04.228 --> 01:04:08.355
I'm gonna tell you story
that has a beginning and a middle,

01:04:08.357 --> 01:04:11.733
and I'd like to see
if we can figure out the end.

01:04:11.735 --> 01:04:15.362
Seven years ago, I was hired
to tend the casino bar.

01:04:15.364 --> 01:04:19.491
Five years ago, I was promoted
to managing the bar.

01:04:19.493 --> 01:04:26.040
And four years, 364 days ago,
I started stealing from the bar.

01:04:26.042 --> 01:04:31.170
Every week,
I'd sneak about 500 bucks.

01:04:31.172 --> 01:04:36.092
Sometimes a little less,
sometimes a little more.

01:04:36.094 --> 01:04:39.179
But I never exceed
2,000 a month.

01:04:41.850 --> 01:04:44.349
Two grand a month,
times 12 months,

01:04:44.351 --> 01:04:46.811
times five years.

01:04:46.813 --> 01:04:50.773
You guys do the math.

01:04:50.775 --> 01:04:53.775
Stealing the money
was the easy part.

01:04:53.777 --> 01:04:56.154
Now I need to get it out.

01:04:56.156 --> 01:04:57.822
Every time we enter,
they search us.

01:04:57.824 --> 01:04:59.824
Every time we exit,
they search us.

01:04:59.826 --> 01:05:02.201
We can't bring any cash in
with us,

01:05:02.203 --> 01:05:04.746
and we can't take
any of our tips home.

01:05:04.748 --> 01:05:06.998
If only she watched the bar
this closely,

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.791
we wouldn't even be having
this conversation.

01:05:09.793 --> 01:05:12.920
But here we are.

01:05:12.922 --> 01:05:17.215
There is $120,000
waiting for us to rescue it.

01:05:17.217 --> 01:05:19.844
And if you guys
can help me do that,

01:05:19.846 --> 01:05:22.429
you can take half.

01:05:28.228 --> 01:05:29.645
Why now?

01:05:29.647 --> 01:05:32.648
Why do you wanna get
the money out now?

01:05:32.650 --> 01:05:34.608
Roxanne is dying.

01:05:34.610 --> 01:05:36.694
And she isn't taking it
very well.

01:05:36.696 --> 01:05:38.612
And I need to get out
while I still can.

01:05:38.614 --> 01:05:40.864
Does anyone else
know you've been doing this?

01:05:40.866 --> 01:05:42.449
Friend?
Co-worker?

01:05:42.451 --> 01:05:44.284
The new bartender looks
at me funny sometimes,

01:05:44.286 --> 01:05:47.329
but I'm pretty sure
he's just staring.

01:05:47.331 --> 01:05:49.998
Well, if they're as
thorough as you say they are,

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.293
then distraction is the way
we gotta do this.

01:05:52.295 --> 01:05:56.588
Get their eyes off of you
and onto somebody else.

01:05:56.590 --> 01:05:59.592
Are they watching anyone
right now?

01:05:59.594 --> 01:06:03.804
As a matter of fact, they are.

01:06:03.806 --> 01:06:05.348
Blackjack switch.

01:06:05.350 --> 01:06:08.183
Basically, the same game,
but the player plays two hands,

01:06:08.185 --> 01:06:10.353
and they have the opportunity
to switch out the top cards

01:06:10.355 --> 01:06:11.436
if they want.

01:06:11.438 --> 01:06:12.521
What's the catch?

01:06:12.523 --> 01:06:14.815
The dealer no longer busts
at 22.

01:06:14.817 --> 01:06:16.275
Instead, it's a push.

01:06:16.277 --> 01:06:18.527
22 comes up more often
than you'd think,

01:06:18.529 --> 01:06:19.904
and we have
one particular dealer

01:06:19.906 --> 01:06:22.532
who likes to bend the rules
a little when that happens.

01:06:22.534 --> 01:06:23.532
He pays out?

01:06:23.534 --> 01:06:25.659
She pays out.

01:06:25.661 --> 01:06:28.579
I guess you should've switched
to switch.

01:06:28.581 --> 01:06:29.746
What time do you enter?

01:06:29.748 --> 01:06:31.165
- 05:30.
- Where do you go?

01:06:31.167 --> 01:06:33.543
Straight through the entrance,
past the stage,

01:06:33.545 --> 01:06:35.795
and I sit down
at blackjack switch.

01:06:35.797 --> 01:06:37.712
And who do you
see when you sit down?

01:06:37.714 --> 01:06:39.257
I see our dealer.

01:06:39.259 --> 01:06:40.550
Hopefully under
heavy surveillance

01:06:40.552 --> 01:06:44.387
by her pit boss.

01:06:44.389 --> 01:06:46.931
As soon as I enter,
I go straight to the bar.

01:06:46.933 --> 01:06:48.099
And what are you wearing?

01:06:48.101 --> 01:06:50.058
I'm wearing your
backpack under my coat.

01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:52.770
I order a drink,
then I go to the cashier,

01:06:52.772 --> 01:06:55.273
and I attempt to change
the counterfeit chips.

01:06:55.275 --> 01:06:57.190
If my memory's still working
at that point,

01:06:57.192 --> 01:06:59.235
I continue the act,
if it isn't...

01:06:59.237 --> 01:07:02.279
You'll probably be
even more distracting.

01:07:02.281 --> 01:07:04.532
Probably.

01:07:04.534 --> 01:07:07.784
Now I don't know about you
guys, but as far as I'm concerned,

01:07:07.786 --> 01:07:10.579
bad things come in threes.

01:07:10.581 --> 01:07:13.833
We already
have our rogue dealer,

01:07:13.835 --> 01:07:15.753
who are you two gonna be?

01:07:35.315 --> 01:07:39.942
I uh, I found these.

01:07:39.944 --> 01:07:44.991
My partner and I
used to wear 'em on jobs.

01:07:57.087 --> 01:07:59.003
What happens to us?

01:07:59.005 --> 01:08:01.380
When this is over?

01:08:01.382 --> 01:08:04.509
We both get 60 grand richer.

01:08:04.511 --> 01:08:07.929
You get your painting.

01:08:07.931 --> 01:08:13.851
Maybe we meet up again someday
in a casino somewhere.

01:08:13.853 --> 01:08:16.520
I'm getting
the fuck out of there,

01:08:16.522 --> 01:08:20.817
and I'm not looking back.

01:08:20.819 --> 01:08:25.569
Are you gonna tell him?

01:08:25.572 --> 01:08:28.783
I've made peace with
my lack of father figure.

01:08:28.785 --> 01:08:31.786
Have you?

01:08:31.787 --> 01:08:32.828
If things start to go bad,

01:08:32.830 --> 01:08:36.165
can I count on you
to keep your cool?

01:08:36.167 --> 01:08:39.002
Can I count on you
to stick to the plan?

01:08:40.671 --> 01:08:42.505
What are you asking me?

01:08:42.506 --> 01:08:46.094
I'm asking you not to freak out
and shoot Frank in the head.

01:08:49.513 --> 01:08:51.430
I don't have a gun.

Excuse me?

01:11:15.826 --> 01:11:18.702
Is this blackjack switch?

01:11:18.704 --> 01:11:21.831
Doesn't it look like it?

01:11:21.833 --> 01:11:24.002
Well...

01:11:28.005 --> 01:11:30.256
Changing 100.

01:11:36.263 --> 01:11:37.764
Sir, before we start,

01:11:37.766 --> 01:11:40.015
I'd just like to be
totally honest with you here,

01:11:40.017 --> 01:11:43.435
umm, I've never...

01:11:43.437 --> 01:11:46.980
You've never dealt
a blind man before.

01:11:46.982 --> 01:11:48.858
No.

01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:50.193
That's alright.

01:11:50.195 --> 01:11:54.488
I just need you to narrate
for me, if you don't mind.

01:11:54.490 --> 01:11:56.032
No, no problem.

01:11:56.034 --> 01:11:59.577
And if you feel like it,
maybe slide me some extra chips

01:11:59.579 --> 01:12:01.953
when your pit boss
isn't looking.

01:12:01.955 --> 01:12:03.163
If they ask me
if I saw anything,

01:12:03.165 --> 01:12:05.043
I can legally deny it.

01:12:12.549 --> 01:12:14.091
How we doin'?

01:12:14.093 --> 01:12:16.135
Looks like our pit boss
is buying it.

01:12:16.137 --> 01:12:18.679
Can't take his eyes off him.

01:12:18.681 --> 01:12:20.055
Good.

01:12:20.057 --> 01:12:22.058
Where's the other bartender?

01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:24.226
In the back,
grabbing some bottles.

01:12:24.228 --> 01:12:26.397
Is he gonna be a problem?

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:30.190
Alright.

01:12:30.192 --> 01:12:32.109
Ready for phase two?

01:12:32.111 --> 01:12:33.570
You're up.

01:12:41.538 --> 01:12:45.163
I'm showing King Two,
that's 12.

01:12:45.165 --> 01:12:48.376
I'm taking a card.

01:12:48.378 --> 01:12:49.918
Queen.

01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:51.170
22.

01:12:51.172 --> 01:12:55.341
That's... another push.

01:12:55.343 --> 01:12:56.967
That comes up a lot, huh?

01:12:56.969 --> 01:12:59.136
More than people think.

01:12:59.138 --> 01:13:01.889
Sir, you still have 50
on the table.

01:13:01.891 --> 01:13:04.850
Would you like another hand?

01:13:04.852 --> 01:13:11.107
You know what, let me buy in
just a little more.

01:13:21.119 --> 01:13:22.702
Well, count it.

01:13:29.878 --> 01:13:31.961
Changing 1,900.

01:13:40.429 --> 01:13:42.305
I found these earlier.

01:13:42.307 --> 01:13:44.601
I just want you to tell me
how rich I am.

01:13:49.355 --> 01:13:50.979
Need me to grab anything else?

01:13:50.981 --> 01:13:53.940
No, I think we're good.

01:13:53.942 --> 01:13:56.610
I'm just gonna go
to the bathroom.

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:04.618
What do you mean
they're not real?

01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:06.412
Sir, I need you
to calm down, please.

01:14:06.414 --> 01:14:07.662
Oh, would you calm down

01:14:07.664 --> 01:14:09.665
if I was trying to steal
your money?

01:14:09.667 --> 01:14:11.375
No one is trying to cheat you
out of anything,

01:14:11.377 --> 01:14:13.502
I can assure you,
these are counterfeit chips.

01:14:13.504 --> 01:14:16.380
I get it, it's because I'm old,
isn't it, huh?

01:14:16.382 --> 01:14:17.840
You think you can pull
a fast one

01:14:17.842 --> 01:14:19.926
on the demented old dude.

01:14:19.928 --> 01:14:21.551
That is absolutely not the case.

01:14:21.553 --> 01:14:23.054
Well. I don't want to talk
to you,

01:14:23.056 --> 01:14:25.348
I want to talk
to your supervisor!

01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:27.809
Sir, I am the supervisor.

01:14:27.811 --> 01:14:31.356
Well then, I don't fucking
want to talk to you!

01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:34.692
That doesn't sound good.

01:14:38.362 --> 01:14:40.529
Sir, we have a problem
at the cashier,

01:14:40.531 --> 01:14:42.030
so I'm gonna temporarily close
this table

01:14:42.032 --> 01:14:43.949
till we get it resolved.

01:14:43.951 --> 01:14:44.867
Hey, it's fine, I can still...

01:14:44.869 --> 01:14:46.538
Let's go.

01:14:51.209 --> 01:14:54.418
Sir, if you'd just give me
your glass.

01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:55.920
You think I'm a drunk?

01:14:55.922 --> 01:15:00.216
No, but if you don't calm down,
I will call security.

01:15:00.218 --> 01:15:02.051
You know what you are?

01:15:02.053 --> 01:15:03.927
You are an ageist.

01:15:03.929 --> 01:15:06.680
And a racist!

01:15:14.982 --> 01:15:16.440
What can I get you?

01:15:16.442 --> 01:15:18.360
What the fuck
are you doing here?

01:15:23.282 --> 01:15:27.493
Excuse me, do I...
do I know you?

01:15:27.495 --> 01:15:29.369
Oh.

01:15:29.371 --> 01:15:32.247
I don't give a shit
if you forgot your Viagra,

01:15:32.249 --> 01:15:34.876
prune juice, and Depends.

01:15:34.878 --> 01:15:37.502
You're gonna abide
by our fuckin' rules.

01:15:37.504 --> 01:15:39.257
Hey!

01:15:43.093 --> 01:15:45.471
Who are you?

01:15:47.432 --> 01:15:48.765
What's in the bag, Darryl?

01:15:48.767 --> 01:15:50.224
Why do I feel
you know the answer

01:15:50.226 --> 01:15:51.768
to that question, huh?

01:15:51.770 --> 01:15:54.103
And why do I feel like
you're here with Winona?

01:15:54.105 --> 01:15:56.146
I told you the first time
we met that if there's money,

01:15:56.148 --> 01:15:57.398
I'm in.

01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:58.524
Sometimes you just gotta screw
some people over,

01:15:58.526 --> 01:16:00.150
that's just the way it goes.

01:16:00.152 --> 01:16:02.987
What's in the fucking bag?

01:16:15.627 --> 01:16:17.462
Jesus, go get him some water.

01:16:19.129 --> 01:16:21.756
Should I call 9-1-1?

01:16:21.758 --> 01:16:24.966
Not if you wanna keep
your job, Tina.

01:16:24.968 --> 01:16:25.969
What is this?

01:16:31.392 --> 01:16:34.018
It was you.

01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:36.311
You ratted me out.

01:16:36.313 --> 01:16:37.771
You told her about the drugs.

01:16:37.773 --> 01:16:39.940
Look, he's at the cash
right now,

01:16:39.942 --> 01:16:42.318
he's not even paying attention
to the exit, okay?

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:43.568
This is our only chance.

01:16:43.570 --> 01:16:45.904
I don't know...

01:16:45.906 --> 01:16:47.448
I don't know where I am.

01:16:47.450 --> 01:16:51.661
Let me see
the old geezer's chips.

01:16:51.663 --> 01:16:53.578
If you let me go,
I promise you,

01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:57.291
I will give you half.

01:16:57.293 --> 01:16:59.670
You have something
that belongs to me.

01:17:01.213 --> 01:17:02.755
Go, I got this.

01:17:02.757 --> 01:17:05.006
Where'd you get these, old man?

01:17:05.008 --> 01:17:06.300
Huh?

01:17:06.302 --> 01:17:07.846
- Oh!
- Hey!

01:17:11.975 --> 01:17:13.349
Hey, blind man.

01:17:13.351 --> 01:17:14.768
Catch.

01:17:17.896 --> 01:17:20.480
Go to the bathroom,
lock yourself in,

01:17:20.482 --> 01:17:22.442
and I'll let you keep
your balls.

01:17:22.444 --> 01:17:25.278
Yeah, umm, that seems fair.

01:17:34.079 --> 01:17:35.704
Robbie.

01:17:35.706 --> 01:17:38.916
Why don't we just take
these glasses off, huh?

01:17:38.918 --> 01:17:40.333
Where's Red?

01:17:56.393 --> 01:17:58.062
Winona.

01:18:03.817 --> 01:18:05.027
I quit.

01:18:07.362 --> 01:18:08.653
Roxanne...

01:18:08.655 --> 01:18:09.488
Go!

01:18:09.490 --> 01:18:10.530
Hey!

01:18:10.532 --> 01:18:11.868
Ahh!

01:18:14.620 --> 01:18:16.369
Frank...

01:18:16.371 --> 01:18:18.288
I thought I lost you there
for a second.

01:18:18.290 --> 01:18:20.207
My brain's not dead yet.

01:19:06.839 --> 01:19:13.176
Bring the hammer back,
take a deep breath, don't panic.

01:19:39.539 --> 01:19:42.081
You go
east, I'll go west.

01:19:42.083 --> 01:19:44.500
Whatever happens...

01:19:44.502 --> 01:19:47.252
Remember,
you only have six shots...

01:19:47.254 --> 01:19:49.132
So make 'em count, son.

01:19:51.468 --> 01:19:54.469
Hey.

01:19:54.471 --> 01:19:55.470
Face.

01:19:55.472 --> 01:19:56.470
Velvet.

01:19:56.472 --> 01:19:57.430
Church.

01:19:57.432 --> 01:19:58.473
Daisy.

01:19:58.475 --> 01:19:59.806
Red.

01:19:59.808 --> 01:20:01.143
Right?

01:20:04.271 --> 01:20:06.189
Right.

01:20:06.191 --> 01:20:09.067
Okay.

01:20:10.111 --> 01:20:11.527
Let's do this.

01:21:30.191 --> 01:21:33.192
Are you okay?

01:21:33.194 --> 01:21:34.652
Good.

01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:49.293
Ahh!

01:21:55.258 --> 01:21:57.385
Nice shooting.

01:22:12.566 --> 01:22:14.817
Hey.

01:22:14.819 --> 01:22:16.946
We still have a job
to finish, huh?

01:23:12.794 --> 01:23:15.463
I killed your father
with that gun.

01:23:19.676 --> 01:23:24.010
I know who you are.

01:23:24.012 --> 01:23:27.808
How?

01:23:32.981 --> 01:23:37.567
Did you know I painted it?

01:23:37.569 --> 01:23:40.403
I made it when I was five.

01:23:40.405 --> 01:23:42.738
Robert never told me that.

01:23:42.740 --> 01:23:45.241
Then why'd you take it?

01:23:45.243 --> 01:23:48.869
You must have known
it was worthless.

01:23:48.871 --> 01:23:51.329
I always liked it.

01:23:55.378 --> 01:24:01.134
If I'm remembering correctly,
you have one bullet left.

01:24:07.807 --> 01:24:09.265
I've thought about putting
this bullet

01:24:09.267 --> 01:24:12.100
through your skull every day
since the day

01:24:12.102 --> 01:24:14.770
you stole my life from me.

01:24:14.772 --> 01:24:17.275
Can I give you some advice?

01:24:20.445 --> 01:24:22.030
Don't.

01:24:27.118 --> 01:24:29.743
I've never been good
at anything, Frank.

01:24:29.745 --> 01:24:33.956
I do nothing, I have no one.

01:24:33.958 --> 01:24:36.501
I used to blame you for that.

01:24:36.503 --> 01:24:42.631
I thought maybe the one thing
I could be good at was revenge.

01:24:42.633 --> 01:24:44.634
I fucked that up too.

01:24:56.021 --> 01:24:59.524
Do you know
where I fucked up the most?

01:24:59.526 --> 01:25:02.902
I've hated you for 20 years.

01:25:02.904 --> 01:25:05.490
It only took you a month
to get me to like you.

01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:21.338
I'm gonna tell you something,
nobody ever told me.

01:25:23.258 --> 01:25:27.342
Something I never even told
my own son.

01:25:27.344 --> 01:25:32.640
You've got something
to offer the world.

01:25:32.642 --> 01:25:35.353
Use it before you lose it.

01:25:40.107 --> 01:25:44.904
Robbie, what happened to my boy.

01:25:48.031 --> 01:25:50.200
He killed himself.

01:25:51.870 --> 01:25:54.122
I'm sorry, Frank.

01:25:55.330 --> 01:25:58.959
Would you sit
over here with me?

01:26:00.294 --> 01:26:04.214
Just take my mind off dying.

01:26:14.683 --> 01:26:17.435
Frank...

01:26:17.437 --> 01:26:21.605
I'm gonna give you
a list of five words.

01:26:21.607 --> 01:26:25.070
In five minutes, let's see
how many you can remember.

01:26:26.780 --> 01:26:29.404
Face.

01:26:29.406 --> 01:26:31.616
Velvet.

01:26:31.618 --> 01:26:33.951
Church.

01:26:33.953 --> 01:26:35.912
Daisy.

01:26:35.914 --> 01:26:39.334
Red.

01:26:44.004 --> 01:26:46.132
Has it been five minutes yet?

01:26:48.509 --> 01:26:50.219
I'm not sure.

01:26:51.471 --> 01:26:55.515
My watch died.

01:29:02.310 --> 01:29:04.103
Hi.

01:29:10.567 --> 01:29:12.234
You guys take donations?

01:29:12.236 --> 01:29:15.238
Uhh, every $10 gets you
a raffle ticket,

01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:19.411
and it's all for a great cause,
so it's a win-win.

01:29:24.081 --> 01:29:25.997
The real one's a lot bigger.

01:29:25.999 --> 01:29:27.459
I promise.

01:29:31.755 --> 01:29:33.672
I'd like to donate.

01:29:33.674 --> 01:29:37.177
Uh great, umm,
what can we put you down for?

01:29:38.053 --> 01:29:40.470
60,000.

01:29:40.472 --> 01:29:42.765
6,000?

01:29:42.767 --> 01:29:44.477
No, umm...

01:29:47.146 --> 01:29:50.648
60,000.

01:29:57.115 --> 01:29:58.407
Name?

01:30:09.838 --> 01:30:14.838
