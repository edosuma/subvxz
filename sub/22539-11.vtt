Must we die?</i>

00:16.558 --> 00:20.608
<i>Are there beings in the cosmos
who live forever...</i>

00:21.897 --> 00:26.619
<i>...afloat on an endless journey
down the river of time?</i>

02:05.709 --> 02:11.011
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font> Our ancestors marked the passage
of time by the moon and stars.</i>

02:39.618 --> 02:43.464
But it was the people who once
lived here, around 5000 years ago...

02:43.622 --> 02:47.752
...who first started chopping up time into
smaller bite-sized portions of hours...

02:47.918 --> 02:54.346
...and minutes. They call
this place Uruk. We call it Iraq.

02:54.925 --> 02:56.347
It's a part of Mesopotamia...

02:56.510 --> 03:00.390
...the land between the Tigris
and the Euphrates rivers.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.194
The city was invented here.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.889
And one of humanity's
greatest victories was

03:07.901 --> 03:10.449
won in the ceaseless
battle against time.

03:10.607 --> 03:13.611
It was here that we learned
how to write.

03:13.777 --> 03:15.779
Death could no longer silence us.

03:15.946 --> 03:19.450
And writing gave us the power
to reach across the millennia...

03:19.616 --> 03:22.415
...and speak inside
the heads of the living.

03:23.036 --> 03:26.666
<i>No one had ever spoken across
a longer stretch of time's river...</i>

03:26.832 --> 03:30.962
<i>...than this Akkadian princess,
daughter of the first emperor in history...</i>

03:31.128 --> 03:34.428
<i>...and priestess of the moon. Enheduanna.</i>

03:34.589 --> 03:36.591
<i>For not only did she write poetry...</i>

03:36.758 --> 03:40.513
<i>...but Enheduanna did something
no one before her had ever done.</i>

03:40.679 --> 03:43.478
<i>She signed her name to her work.</i>

03:43.640 --> 03:49.397
<i>She's the first person for whom we can say
we know who she was and what she dreamed.</i>

03:49.563 --> 03:54.194
<i>She dreamt of stepping through
the Gate of Wonder.</i>

03:54.359 --> 03:59.536
<i>Here's a thought Enheduanna
sent across more than 4000 years to you.</i>

03:59.698 --> 04:03.828
<i>It's from her work entitled
Lady oi the Largest Heart.</i>

04:17.548 --> 04:19.971
<i>Throughout the entire universe.</i>

04:20.135 --> 04:22.939
And Uruk is also the place
where the epic tale

04:22.951 --> 04:25.767
of the hero's journey
was first written down.

04:25.932 --> 04:30.859
Before Batman, Luke Skywalker,
Odysseus, before them all...

04:31.021 --> 04:36.653
...there was a man named Gilgamesh
who left home on a quest to vanquish time.

04:37.569 --> 04:40.698
<i>Gilgamesh was searching for immortality.</i>

04:40.864 --> 04:44.539
<i>He looked everywhere,
gained complete wisdom...</i>

04:45.285 --> 04:47.253
<i>...uncovered what was hidden.</i>

04:47.412 --> 04:51.007
<i>He brought back a tale of times
before the Great Flood.</i>

04:51.166 --> 04:52.213
<font color="#D900D9">(ROARING)</font>

04:52.709 --> 04:57.715
<i>He built the wall of Uruk,
which no future king will ever match.</i>

04:57.881 --> 05:02.762
<i>Read the story of that man, Gilgamesh,
a hero born of Uruk...</i>

05:02.928 --> 05:05.556
<i>...who went through all
kinds of sufferings...</i>

05:05.722 --> 05:08.066
<i>...who crossed the ocean, the broad seas...</i>

05:08.225 --> 05:10.193
<i>...as far as the sunrise...</i>

05:10.352 --> 05:14.482
<i>...who inspected the edges of the world,
searching for eternal life.</i>

05:14.648 --> 05:19.404
<i>On his travels, Gilgamesh encountered
a wise man named Utnapishtim...</i>

05:19.569 --> 05:22.914
<i>...who told him the story of a flood
that destroyed the world...</i>

05:23.073 --> 05:26.077
<i>...and how one of the gods
instructed Utnapishtim...</i>

05:26.243 --> 05:30.794
<i>...to build an ark
to rescue his family and the animals.</i>

06:03.321 --> 06:08.418
The earliest surviving account of the flood
legend was written down in Mesopotamia...

06:08.577 --> 06:13.925
...a thousand years before it was retold
as the story of Noah in the Old Testament.

06:14.082 --> 06:18.383
So you could say Gilgamesh
fulfilled his quest for immortality.

06:18.545 --> 06:22.675
<i>We still read the Epic of Gilgamesh,
and with every reader...</i>

06:22.841 --> 06:24.138
...he lives again.

06:24.301 --> 06:29.478
And all those heroes and superheroes who
have come since follow in the footsteps...

06:29.639 --> 06:31.812
...of the first hero's journey...

06:31.975 --> 06:34.478
...another kind of immortality.

06:34.644 --> 06:40.151
A story sent from one civilization
to another across thousands of years.

06:40.317 --> 06:44.663
But life itself sends its own stories
across billions of years.

06:48.825 --> 06:52.170
It's a message that every one of us
carries inside...

06:52.329 --> 06:55.469
...inscribed in all the
cells of our bodies in

06:55.481 --> 06:58.632
a language that all
life on Earth can read.

06:58.793 --> 07:03.549
The genetic code is written in an alphabet
consisting of only four letters.

07:03.715 --> 07:09.813
Each letter is a molecule made of atoms.
Each word is three letters long.

07:09.971 --> 07:13.191
Every living thing
is a masterpiece...

07:13.350 --> 07:16.650
...written by nature
and edited by evolution.

07:16.811 --> 07:18.358
The instructions for running...

07:18.521 --> 07:21.525
...and reproducing
the intricate machinery of life.

07:22.150 --> 07:24.619
The essential message of life
has been copied...

07:24.778 --> 07:28.203
...and recopied
for more than 3 billion years.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.743
But where did that message
come from?

07:30.909 --> 07:32.627
Nobody knows.

07:42.170 --> 07:44.423
Perhaps it began in a shallow,
sunlit pool...

07:44.589 --> 07:46.057
...just like this.

07:46.216 --> 07:52.394
Somehow, carbon-rich molecules began using
energy to make crude copies of themselves.

07:52.555 --> 07:56.685
Some varieties were better
at making copies, and left more offspring.

07:56.851 --> 08:00.230
The competing molecules
became more elaborate.

08:00.397 --> 08:03.742
Evolution and life itself
was underway.

08:07.070 --> 08:10.460
<i>Or life could've started
in the searing heat</i>

08:10.472 --> 08:13.874
<i>of a volcanic vent on
the deep sea floor.</i>

08:17.789 --> 08:22.010
<i>Or is it possible that life came to Earth
as a hitchhiker?</i>

08:22.544 --> 08:27.641
<i>Let me tell you a story about a traveler
from another world.</i>

08:32.595 --> 08:36.600
<i>The peace of the Egyptian village
of Nakhla, near Alexandria...</i>

08:36.765 --> 08:40.816
<i>...was abruptly shattered
on a June morning in 1911.</i>

08:54.784 --> 08:58.914
<i>Written in this meteorite
was a message from another planet.</i>

08:59.080 --> 09:03.711
<i>But 70 years would pass
before anyone could read it.</i>

09:06.546 --> 09:12.644
<i>In 1976, NASA landed two Viking
spacecraft on Mars.</i>

09:12.802 --> 09:17.933
<i>Carl Sagan took us there on our original
journey through the cosmos.</i>

09:18.099 --> 09:22.149
<i><font color="#808080">SAGAN :</font> We found that the Martian air
was less than 1 percent as dense as ours...</i>

09:22.312 --> 09:25.156
<i>...and made mostly of carbon dioxide.</i>

09:25.315 --> 09:30.492
<i>There were smaller amounts of nitrogen,
argon, water vapor and oxygen.</i>

09:31.321 --> 09:34.666
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font> A few years later, when scientists
thought to analyze the gasses...</i>

09:34.824 --> 09:38.749
<i>...trapped inside the Nakhia meteorite,
and other members of its class...</i>

09:38.912 --> 09:42.007
<i>...they found a striking similarity.</i>

09:42.165 --> 09:45.760
<i>The vast majority of meteorites
are fragments of asteroids.</i>

09:45.919 --> 09:51.517
<i>But the kind that hit Nakhla on Earth
could only have come from one place.</i>

10:02.811 --> 10:04.233
Mars.

10:09.025 --> 10:11.869
<font color="#808080">TYSON :</font>
Welcome to Mars.

10:16.574 --> 10:19.498
Over a billion years ago,
a volcano erupted here...

10:19.661 --> 10:22.540
...and its lava cooled into solid rock.

10:22.705 --> 10:27.131
Hundreds of millions of years later,
this area was flooded with water.

10:27.293 --> 10:31.389
And long after that flood, an asteroid
the size of the Rock of Gibraltar...

10:31.548 --> 10:36.349
...crashed into the Martian surface,
blasting out a huge crater.

10:39.264 --> 10:42.689
Much of the debris
was ejected back out into space...

10:42.851 --> 10:45.012
...where it orbited
the sun until a

10:45.024 --> 10:47.197
gravitational tug from
its home planet, Mars...

10:47.355 --> 10:52.987
...diverted one of the boulders into a
collision course with Earth. Its arrival...

10:53.153 --> 10:56.407
...shook up the little village
of Nakhla. Meteorites...

10:56.573 --> 10:58.325
...of the type that hit Nakhla...

10:58.491 --> 11:02.371
...are the vehicles of a natural
interplanetary transit system...

11:02.537 --> 11:04.881
...that sends rocks between the planets.

11:05.832 --> 11:09.507
<i>Such a meteorite can safely shelter
microscopic cargo...</i>

11:09.669 --> 11:14.266
...the seeds of life,
an interplanetary ark.

11:14.424 --> 11:17.803
Most rocks are porous,
full of tiny nooks and crannies...

11:17.969 --> 11:20.267
...where life can stow away.

11:24.184 --> 11:28.940
<i>We know that some microbes can survive
the hostile environment of space.</i>

11:29.105 --> 11:31.608
<i>Take these guys, for instance.</i>

11:31.774 --> 11:35.574
<i>These microbes spent a year and a half
riding on the outside...</i>

11:35.737 --> 11:40.243
<i>...of the International Space Station,
exposed to the extreme temperatures...</i>

11:40.408 --> 11:43.127
<i>...vacuum, and radiation of space.</i>

11:43.286 --> 11:45.948
<i>And some of them were
still alive and kicking</i>

11:45.960 --> 11:48.634
<i>when they were brought
back to Earth.</i>

11:48.791 --> 11:51.510
<i>Even more astonishing
are these creatures...</i>

11:51.669 --> 11:56.266
<i>...awakened from a death-like sleep
of 8 million years.</i>

11:56.424 --> 11:59.479
<i>They were frozen in the
Antarctic ice millions</i>

11:59.491 --> 12:02.557
<i>of years before our
species even existed.</i>

12:02.722 --> 12:04.315
And they're still alive.

12:06.434 --> 12:11.235
If life can withstand the hardships
of space and endure for millennia...

12:11.397 --> 12:13.849
...then it could ride the
natural interplanetary

12:13.861 --> 12:16.324
transit system from
world to world.

12:16.486 --> 12:20.832
It's a good bet that our microbial
ancestors spent some time in space.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.537
Why do we think so?

12:22.700 --> 12:26.000
The Earth is 4 and a half billion
years old.

12:28.665 --> 12:30.667
<i>For the first half of its lifetime...</i>

12:30.833 --> 12:35.634
<i>...large asteroids were bombarding
the planet every few million years.</i>

12:36.506 --> 12:42.684
<i>The most violent impacts vaporized the
oceans and even melted the surface rock.</i>

12:42.845 --> 12:46.025
<i>Each such collision
would have completely</i>

12:46.037 --> 12:49.228
<i>sterilized the planet
for thousands of years.</i>

12:50.853 --> 12:55.324
<i>But we know from fossils in the rocks
that bacteria were evolving on Earth...</i>

12:55.483 --> 12:57.861
<i>...during this formative period.</i>

12:59.362 --> 13:04.619
<i>So how could life have survived
such a lethal series of blows?</i>

13:05.702 --> 13:08.171
Whenever one of those big asteroids
hit the Earth...

13:08.329 --> 13:13.506
...the explosion would blast out a crater,
launching millions of boulders into space.

13:14.168 --> 13:17.342
Many of those rocks
carried living bacteria inside.

13:17.505 --> 13:19.883
Some of the bugs
would have survived in space...

13:20.049 --> 13:23.644
...while all those left behind on Earth
would have been fried.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.226
<i>A few thousand years after each impact...</i>

13:26.389 --> 13:31.361
<i>...the Earth would have cooled down enough
for water to condense into oceans.</i>

13:32.186 --> 13:35.065
<i>The planet would again be habitable.</i>

13:35.231 --> 13:41.910
Meanwhile, most of the rocks launched into
space would have been orbiting the sun.

13:42.572 --> 13:45.701
<i>Some of them would encounter
the Earth again...</i>

13:45.867 --> 13:47.869
<i>...reenter the atmosphere as meteorites...</i>

13:48.036 --> 13:52.917
<i>...and deliver their precious cargo of life
to re-seed the planet...</i>

13:54.917 --> 13:56.840
<i>...like Noah's ark.</i>

13:57.003 --> 14:00.257
<i>What this means is that life
doesn't have to start over again...</i>

14:00.423 --> 14:03.597
<i>...from scratch after each catastrophe.</i>

14:03.760 --> 14:06.764
<i>It can pick up where it left off.</i>

14:06.929 --> 14:08.977
When the solar system
was young...

14:09.140 --> 14:14.738
...Venus was probably more like Earth,
with oceans and maybe even life.

14:14.896 --> 14:18.116
Venus, Earth, and Mars were all
exchanging rocks with each other...

14:18.274 --> 14:20.072
...due to asteroid impacts.

14:20.234 --> 14:24.114
Does life on Earth carry any traces
of interplanetary voyages...

14:24.280 --> 14:25.953
...made in the distant past?

14:26.115 --> 14:32.122
Why is it that some microbes can survive
the intense radiation and vacuum of space?

14:32.288 --> 14:35.462
These conditions don't naturally exist
on Earth.

14:35.625 --> 14:39.425
Maybe those bugs are telling us
that their ancestors survived...

14:39.587 --> 14:43.967
...those same conditions in space,
a few billion years ago.

14:45.093 --> 14:48.768
So we know that microbes can stow away
in rocks and survive the voyage...

14:48.930 --> 14:50.557
...from planet to planet.

14:50.723 --> 14:55.820
But what about a trip from star to star,
an interstellar odyssey?

15:03.820 --> 15:05.663
The dandelion.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.408
Around 30 million years ago...

15:08.574 --> 15:14.957
...it evolved another way to send its
own message of life through space and time.

15:22.130 --> 15:26.351
<i>Each seedling is a little paratrooper,
floating on the wind...</i>

15:26.509 --> 15:30.013
<i>...risking everything for
a safe place to land.</i>

15:30.972 --> 15:34.567
<i>Updrafts can carry them
higher into the air.</i>

15:34.725 --> 15:36.648
<i>A dandelion can travel dozens...</i>

15:36.811 --> 15:38.859
<i>...possibly hundreds of kilometers...</i>

15:39.021 --> 15:41.365
<i>...even crossing over mountain ranges.</i>

15:42.650 --> 15:46.780
<i>Evolution has shaped it
into an exquisite flying machine.</i>

15:48.114 --> 15:50.583
The seed is another kind of ark...

15:50.741 --> 15:53.215
...ensuring the survival
of its species by riding

15:53.227 --> 15:55.713
the currents of the
atmosphere to safe harbors.

15:55.872 --> 15:59.718
Each seed, in its DNA,
carries a story...

15:59.876 --> 16:02.720
...the character and destiny
of the next dandelion.

16:02.879 --> 16:07.225
Life propagates by retelling its story.

16:08.551 --> 16:13.398
<i>Is it possible that life could survive
the journey from star to star?</i>

16:13.556 --> 16:19.154
The stars are about a million times farther
apart from each other than are the planets.

16:19.312 --> 16:22.537
Space is so vast that
it would take billions

16:22.549 --> 16:25.786
of years for a rock
ejected from the Earth...

16:25.943 --> 16:29.413
<i>...to collide with a planet
circling another star.</i>

16:29.572 --> 16:35.124
Any stowaway microbes would never survive
the cosmic radiation for that long.

16:35.286 --> 16:37.925
But there's a plausible
scenario for how life

16:37.937 --> 16:40.588
could spread from one
solar system to another.

16:46.464 --> 16:49.513
<i>The stars of the Milky Way are drawn
by gravity...</i>

16:49.675 --> 16:53.054
<i>...in their own enormous orbits
around its center.</i>

16:53.221 --> 16:54.564
<i>Our sun, for example...</i>

16:54.722 --> 17:00.229
<i>...takes some 225 million years
to complete a single orbit.</i>

17:00.394 --> 17:02.738
<i>During each revolution around the galaxy...</i>

17:02.897 --> 17:08.154
<i>...our solar system will pass through two
or three gigantic interstellar clouds...</i>

17:08.319 --> 17:11.868
<i>...each of them many light-years across.</i>

17:15.367 --> 17:19.544
<i>Galaxies are world-making machines.</i>

17:19.704 --> 17:23.255
<i>Our Milky Way has more than 100
of these vast clouds...</i>

17:23.416 --> 17:28.969
<i>...places where gas and dust condense
to form new stars and planets.</i>

17:32.009 --> 17:34.137
<i>In its travels through the Milky Way...</i>

17:34.303 --> 17:37.557
<i>...our sun is accompanied
not only by its planets...</i>

17:37.723 --> 17:41.478
<i>...but also by a trillion distant comets.</i>

17:42.520 --> 17:46.491
<i>When our solar system
passes through an interstellar cloud...</i>

17:46.649 --> 17:51.621

of Mesopotamia...

26:37.721 --> 26:40.520

26:40.682 --> 26:44.528

26:49.024 --> 26:50.822

<i>...that was the basis for the great

<i>...had an unintended consequence.</i>

27:02.538 --> 27:05.462
<i>The water channeled
into their farmlands every year...</i>

27:05.624 --> 27:08.924
<i>...evaporated and left its salt behind.</i>

27:09.086 --> 27:13.592
<i>Over generations, the salt accumulated
and began to kill the crops.</i>

27:29.898 --> 27:31.366
<i>Barbarians invaded.</i>

27:31.525 --> 27:34.495
<i>The streets of many cities
were littered with dead.</i>

<i>There could be only one explanation.</i>

27:37.030 --> 27:39.749

27:49.751 --> 27:53.051
<i>...Greece, India, Pakistan and China.</i>

27:53.213 --> 27:57.434

<i>There are so many ways
for a civilization to die.</i>

28:41.428 --> 28:44.648
Let's start with the ones that
we wouldn't be able to do much about.

28:47.142 --> 28:50.772

28:50.938 --> 28:54.988
<i>If it were much closer,
say less than 30 light-years from Earth...</i>

28:55.150 --> 28:59.576
<i>...its cosmic radiation would shred
the atmosphere's protective ozone layer...</i>

28:59.738 --> 29:02.116
...and destroy our civilization.

29:02.282 --> 29:05.331
Lucky for us, none of the
stars close enough to harm us...

29:05.494 --> 29:09.499
...are likely to go supernova any time
in the next few hundred million years.

29:15.462 --> 29:19.968
<i>Every million years or so,
a supervolcano erupts somewhere on Earth.</i>

29:21.009 --> 29:24.684
<i>The last time it happened
was 74,000 years ago...</i>

29:24.846 --> 29:28.976
<i>...on the island of Sumatra
in what is now Indonesia.</i>

29:29.142 --> 29:33.648
<i>It spewed hundreds of times more
rock, ash and toxic gas...</i>

29:33.814 --> 29:37.444
<i>...than any single volcano
in recorded history.</i>

29:37.609 --> 29:41.955
<i>The molten rock that erupted from
Earth's crust left this caldera...</i>

29:42.114 --> 29:46.711
<i>100 kilometers long, now
filled with a lake.</i>

29:49.079 --> 29:53.585
<i>The Toba volcano sent
more than 600 cubic miles...</i>

29:53.750 --> 29:56.799
<i>...of pulverized rock soaring skyward.</i>

29:56.962 --> 30:00.557
<i>The westward wind
carried the volcanic ash over India...</i>

30:00.716 --> 30:05.267
<i>...where it fell out in a smothering
blanket over the subcontinent.</i>

30:05.595 --> 30:09.441
<i>The eruption loaded the upper atmosphere
with sulfur gases.</i>

30:09.599 --> 30:13.103
<i>The result was a global haze
that blocked most of the sunlight...</i>

30:13.270 --> 30:16.194
<i>...from reaching the surface
for at least five years.</i>

30:16.356 --> 30:20.361
<i>It was like one five-year-long cloudy day.</i>

30:21.486 --> 30:25.161
<i>This so-called volcanic winter
resembled a nuclear winter...</i>

30:25.324 --> 30:27.702
<i>...but without the radiation.</i>

30:28.910 --> 30:30.912
Temperatures fell everywhere.

30:31.079 --> 30:33.753
Plants and animals froze,
even in the tropics...

30:33.915 --> 30:36.043
...dying in enormous numbers.

30:36.209 --> 30:40.089
But life is hardy. Only a few species
were driven to extinction.

30:40.255 --> 30:43.850
One of our ancestors in central India
sharpened this stone blade...

30:44.009 --> 30:46.603
...in the years before the Toba eruption.

30:47.262 --> 30:51.108
And this blade was one of dozens
that were found in the soil layer...

30:51.266 --> 30:53.394
...above the volcanic fallout.

30:53.560 --> 30:55.403
This tells us that some toolmakers...

30:55.562 --> 30:58.281
...even in the area
directly affected by the volcano...

30:58.440 --> 31:00.238
...managed to survive the cataclysm.

31:01.026 --> 31:05.452
But the global human population
must have plummeted before rebounding.

31:05.614 --> 31:08.117
If an eruption like this
were to happen tomorrow...

31:08.283 --> 31:10.706
...our civilization would be
brought to its knees...

31:10.869 --> 31:14.248
...although the human species
would survive.

31:16.833 --> 31:20.178
I can imagine that our technology
of a few hundred years from now...

31:20.337 --> 31:23.967
...would allow us to siphon off the energy
of a threatening supervolcano...

31:24.132 --> 31:25.475
...before it explodes.

31:25.634 --> 31:28.478
We could then use that energy
for our own purposes.

31:28.637 --> 31:32.312
About once every million years,
a small asteroid collides with the Earth...

31:32.474 --> 31:35.318
<i>...causing a similar amount of devastation.</i>

31:35.685 --> 31:37.483
<i>With our science and technology...</i>

31:37.646 --> 31:40.320
<i>...we already know how
to prevent an asteroid impact.</i>

31:40.482 --> 31:42.484
<i>We would see it coming years in advance...</i>

31:42.651 --> 31:46.076
<i>...and could send a spacecraft there
to deflect it into a harmless orbit.</i>

31:46.238 --> 31:48.661
With the technology
of a thousand years from now...

31:48.824 --> 31:52.579
...we might even be able to mitigate
the deadly effects of a nearby supernova...

31:52.744 --> 31:54.462
...on Earth's atmosphere.

31:54.621 --> 31:58.592
But what happens when
the danger to a civilization is invisible?

31:58.750 --> 32:00.673
When no one can see it coming?

the European invaders of the Americas...

32:13.181 --> 32:17.277
...had a secret weapon
that even they knew nothing about.

32:17.436 --> 32:21.987
<i>They were carrying bacteria and viruses
for deadly diseases, such as smallpox...</i>

32:22.149 --> 32:26.325
<i>...that the original Americans
had never been exposed to.</i>

32:26.486 --> 32:28.625
<i>The Europeans like to
believe that it was their</i>

32:28.637 --> 32:30.787
<i>valor and superior
weapons and culture...</i>

32:30.949 --> 32:32.792
<i>...that won them the New World.</i>

32:32.951 --> 32:36.296
<i>The real conquistadors
were the armies of the pathogens...</i>

32:36.455 --> 32:39.880
<i>...that raced on ahead
to infect and kill nine out of 10...</i>

32:40.041 --> 32:44.296
<i>...of all the Indians of North,
Central and South America.</i>

32:45.589 --> 32:48.263
<i>The great civilizations of the New World
crumbled...</i>

32:48.425 --> 32:51.224
<i>...under the onslaught
of invading microbes.</i>

32:51.386 --> 32:52.979
<i>Without his invisible army...</i>

32:53.138 --> 32:57.939
<i>...Cortez and those who followed
might never have stood a chance.</i>

32:59.019 --> 33:02.398
But what about civilizations
that self-destruct?

33:10.739 --> 33:14.869
<i>Our economic systems were formed
when the planet and its air...</i>

33:15.035 --> 33:19.711
<i>...rivers, oceans, lands,
all seemed infinite.</i>

33:19.873 --> 33:22.968
<i>They evolved
long before we first saw the Earth...</i>

33:23.126 --> 33:26.505
<i>...as the tiny organism
that it actually is.</i>

33:26.671 --> 33:28.218
<i>They're all alike in one respect.</i>

33:28.381 --> 33:32.261
<i>They're profit-driven, and therefore,
focused on short-term gain.</i>

34:00.247 --> 34:04.468
<i>The prevailing economic systems,
no matter what their ideologies...</i>

34:04.626 --> 34:08.301
<i>...have no built-in mechanisms
for protecting our descendants...</i>

34:08.463 --> 34:13.514
<i>...of even 100 years from now,
let alone 100,000.</i>

34:17.931 --> 34:22.152
In one respect, we're ahead
of the people of Ancient Mesopotamia.

34:22.310 --> 34:26.110
Unlike them, we understand
what's happening to our world.

34:26.565 --> 34:29.819
For example, we're pumping
greenhouse gases into our atmosphere...

34:29.985 --> 34:32.487
...at a rate not seen on Earth
for a million years.

34:33.112 --> 34:36.458
And the scientific consensus
that we're destabilizing our climate.

34:37.158 --> 34:40.331
Yet, our civilization seems to be
in the grip of denial...

34:41.204 --> 34:42.831
...a kind of paralysis.

34:42.998 --> 34:47.003
There's a disconnect between
what we know and what we do.

34:50.714 --> 34:53.638
Being able to adapt our behavior
to challenges...

34:53.800 --> 34:57.771
...is as good a definition
of intelligence as any I know.

35:02.100 --> 35:05.946
<i>If our greater intelligence
is the hallmark of our species...</i>

35:06.104 --> 35:09.529
<i>...then we should use it,
as all other beings use their advantages...</i>

35:09.691 --> 35:14.197
<i>...to help ensure that their offspring
prosper, and their heredity is passed on...</i>

35:14.362 --> 35:18.868
<i>...and that the fabric of nature
that sustains us is protected.</i>

35:19.034 --> 35:23.835
<i>Human intelligence is imperfect, surely,
and newly arisen.</i>

35:23.997 --> 35:27.422
<i>The ease with which it can be sweet-talked,
overwhelmed, or subverted...</i>

35:27.584 --> 35:29.302
<i>...by other hard-wired tendencies...</i>

35:29.461 --> 35:34.137
<i>...sometimes themselves disguised
as the light of reason, is worrisome.</i>

35:35.008 --> 35:39.229
<i>But if our intelligence is the only edge,
we must learn to use it better.</i>

35:39.387 --> 35:42.891
<i>To sharpen it. To understand
its limitations and deficiencies.</i>

35:43.642 --> 35:46.816
<i>To use it, as cats use
stealth before pouncing.</i>

35:46.978 --> 35:49.401
<i>As walking sticks use camouflage.</i>

35:50.106 --> 35:53.155
<i>To make it the tool of our survival.</i>

35:53.318 --> 35:54.365
<i>If we do this...</i>

35:54.527 --> 35:57.497
<i>...we can solve almost any problem
we are likely to confront...</i>

35:57.656 --> 36:00.830
<i>...in the next 100,000 years.</i>

36:06.998 --> 36:11.094
<i>And now we've arrived at the place
where our ancient dreams of immortality...</i>

36:11.252 --> 36:16.850
...and modern astrophysics converge.
Giant elliptical galaxies...

36:17.008 --> 36:19.682
...are something like Florida...

36:19.844 --> 36:23.098
...where the oldest stars
in the universe may be found.

36:28.728 --> 36:33.609
<i>This is a red dwarf star,
smaller and fainter than our sun.</i>

36:33.775 --> 36:37.951
<i>Red dwarfs are by far
the most plentiful stars in the cosmos.</i>

36:38.113 --> 36:42.289
<i>Unlike the sun, which is halfway through
its 10-billion-year lifetime...</i>

36:42.450 --> 36:46.421
<i>...red dwarfs will continue to provide
light and warmth to their planets...</i>

36:46.579 --> 36:48.297
<i>...for trillions of years.</i>

36:48.456 --> 36:52.802
<i>That's hundreds of times longer
than the present age of the universe.</i>

36:52.961 --> 36:54.884
<i>What would intelligent beings do...</i>

36:55.046 --> 37:00.018
<i>...if they had an eternity to develop
their understanding of the universe?</i>

37:00.176 --> 37:04.306
<i>Perhaps they would learn how to open
shortcuts in the fabric of space-time...</i>

37:04.472 --> 37:08.318
<i>...to travel between galaxies
faster than the speed of light.</i>

37:08.476 --> 37:10.979
<i>Maybe they would create
whole new universes...</i>

37:11.146 --> 37:14.241
<i>...as artistic or scientific experiments.</i>

37:14.399 --> 37:17.573
Of course no one,
or at least nobody on Earth...

37:17.736 --> 37:20.865
...knows what the immortals
might do.

37:21.030 --> 37:24.910
<i>If one allows the imagination free rein...</i>

37:25.410 --> 37:26.832
But what about us?

37:29.998 --> 37:32.672
What is our own future?

37:33.001 --> 37:38.508
What would the cosmic calendar
of the next 14 billion years look like?

37:52.353 --> 37:55.698
<font color="#808080">TYSON :</font> If the original cosmic calendar
includes all of the time...

37:55.857 --> 37:59.031
...from the birth of the universe
until this very moment...

37:59.194 --> 38:04.997
...what would the cosmic calendar look like
for the next 14 billion years?

38:05.366 --> 38:07.869
Just as with the cosmic calendar
of the past...

38:08.036 --> 38:12.291
<i>...every month on the future calendar
equals about a billion years...</i>

38:12.457 --> 38:16.007
<i>...every day, some 40 million.</i>

38:16.503 --> 38:19.382
<i>Science makes it possible
for us to foretell...</i>

38:19.547 --> 38:24.474
<i>...certain astronomical events
in the unimaginably distant future.</i>

38:24.636 --> 38:26.559
<i>The death of the sun, for example.</i>

38:27.013 --> 38:28.936
<i>In some 5 billion years...</i>

38:29.098 --> 38:31.777
<i>...our star will have
exhausted its hydrogen,</i>

38:31.789 --> 38:34.480
<i>the nuclear fuel
that powers it...</i>

38:34.646 --> 38:36.944
<i>...becoming a red giant.</i>

38:37.106 --> 38:40.986
<i>I know that sounds depressing,
but if we apply our intelligence...</i>

38:41.152 --> 38:43.246
<i>...our descendants of
that distant future...</i>

38:43.404 --> 38:47.534
<i>...will have long departed
from the lost worlds of the sun.</i>

38:47.909 --> 38:49.252
<i>Who knows?</i>

38:49.410 --> 38:52.914
Human events entail too many variables,
too many uncertainties...

38:53.081 --> 38:56.051
...to make scientific statements
about our future.

38:56.209 --> 38:58.132
But we can still dream.

38:58.294 --> 39:02.720
The next golden age of human achievement
begins here and now.

39:03.675 --> 39:06.679
<i>New Year's Day of the next cosmic year.</i>

39:06.845 --> 39:08.688
<i>In the first tenth of a second...</i>

39:08.847 --> 39:11.817
<i>...we take the vision
of the pale blue dot to heart...</i>

39:11.975 --> 39:15.696
<i>...and learn how to share this tiny world
with each other.</i>

39:15.854 --> 39:19.404
The last internal combustion engine
is placed in a museum...

39:19.566 --> 39:22.285
...as the effects of climate change
reverse and diminish.

39:23.695 --> 39:26.118
<i>A fifth of a second into this future...</i>

39:26.281 --> 39:29.911
<i>...people will stop dying
from the effects of poverty.</i>

39:30.076 --> 39:32.505
<i>The planet is now a completely</i>

39:32.517 --> 39:34.957
<i>self-sustaining,
intercommunicating organism.</i>

39:35.123 --> 39:36.750
<i>A half-second from now...</i>

39:36.916 --> 39:40.762
...the polar ice caps are restored
to the way they were in the 19th century...

39:40.920 --> 39:45.972
<i>...and the forecast is mild and pleasant
for the next cosmic minute and a half...</i>

39:46.134 --> 39:48.887
<i>...40,000 years.</i>

39:49.721 --> 39:54.022
<i>By the time we are ready to settle
even the nearest other planetary systems...</i>

39:54.183 --> 39:56.652
<i>...we will have changed.</i>

39:57.353 --> 40:01.654
<i>The simple passage of so many generations
will have changed us.</i>

40:01.816 --> 40:04.990
<i>Necessity will have changed us.</i>

40:05.153 --> 40:08.748
<i>We are an adaptable species.</i>

40:09.949 --> 40:12.247
<i>It will not be we who
reach Alpha Centauri...</i>

40:12.410 --> 40:15.505
<i>...and the other nearby star systems
on our interstellar arks.</i>

40:16.581 --> 40:19.084
<i>It will be a species very like us...</i>

40:19.250 --> 40:22.971
<i>...but with more of our strengths
and fewer of our weaknesses.</i>

40:23.129 --> 40:27.680
<i>More confident, far-seeing,
capable and wise.</i>

40:27.842 --> 40:31.688
<i>For all our failings,
despite our flaws and limitations...</i>

40:31.846 --> 40:35.476
<i>...we humans are capable of greatness.</i>

40:36.267 --> 40:39.146
<i>What new wonders, undreamt
of in our time...</i>

40:39.312 --> 40:42.942
<i>...will we have accomplished
in another generation...</i>

40:43.107 --> 40:44.825
<i>...and another?</i>

40:45.860 --> 40:48.830
<i>How far will our nomadic species
have wandered...</i>

40:48.988 --> 40:53.915
<i>...by the end of the next century
and the next millennium?</i>

40:54.786 --> 40:56.504
<i>Our remote descendants...</i>

40:56.663 --> 41:01.339
<i>...safely arrayed on many worlds
throughout the solar system and beyond...</i>

41:01.501 --> 41:04.630
<i>...will be unified by
their common heritage...</i>

41:05.588 --> 41:08.057
<i>...by their regard for their home planet...</i>

41:08.216 --> 41:12.062
<i>...and by the knowledge that
whatever other life there may be...</i>

41:12.220 --> 41:17.226
<i>...the only humans in all the universe
came from Earth.</i>

41:17.850 --> 41:22.902
<i>They will gaze up and strain
to find the blue dot in their skies.</i>

41:23.064 --> 41:28.821
<i>They will marvel at how vulnerable the
repository of all our potential once was...</i>

41:28.987 --> 41:34.539
<i>...how perilous our infancy,
how humble our beginnings.</i>

41:35.576 --> 41:39.501
<i>How many rivers we had to cross...</i>

41:41.541 --> 41:44.841
<i>...before we found our way.</i>
