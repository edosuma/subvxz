WEBVTT

01:42.310 --> 01:46.439
Lundt, sir.
He's back. Do we pick him up?

01:46.523 --> 01:48.858
<i>There'll be a contact. I want both.</i>

01:48.983 --> 01:50.026
Very good, sir.

02:07.836 --> 02:09.169
What now?

02:09.713 --> 02:11.006
We wait.

02:12.048 --> 02:13.675
For his contact.

02:17.012 --> 02:18.179
Christ!

02:18.722 --> 02:20.140
There is no contact.

02:36.072 --> 02:38.408
-Lundt! Mi5!
-Don't move!

02:47.584 --> 02:49.377
If it reaches the coast,

02:50.086 --> 02:52.047
we've lost the bloody war.

03:21.451 --> 03:22.869
-Ah! Oh.
-Oh.

03:24.287 --> 03:26.748
Blimey, Joe.
How'd you do that, then?

03:26.873 --> 03:29.626
Oh, you know me.
Charm the birds from the trees.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.295
Nice shot, boys.

03:32.962 --> 03:34.631
-How many?
-Six.

03:35.882 --> 03:38.218
Two Bob the lot. Now hop it.

03:41.596 --> 03:42.639
Ugh!

03:42.722 --> 03:43.807
-What's the matter with you?
-Oh.

03:43.932 --> 03:45.975
Finest British protein, that is.

03:46.101 --> 03:47.477
Off-rations for jonesy.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.231
Come on, daph.
Give us a cuddle.

03:51.314 --> 03:53.441
- Joe! Joe!
- Oh, blimey!

03:53.483 --> 03:55.819
Can't you see
I'm in the middle of something?

03:55.944 --> 03:57.821
You're wanted in barton's field!

03:57.904 --> 03:59.572
They've found him!

04:17.007 --> 04:18.841
I'm too young to die.

04:18.966 --> 04:20.301
Do be quiet, frank.

04:20.343 --> 04:21.511
And I'm too old.

04:21.636 --> 04:23.096
Hold your nerve, men.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.640
Keep low.

04:28.977 --> 04:31.646
Godfrey, can't you go any lower?

04:31.688 --> 04:35.483
I'll try to, sir,
but I'm not sure I'll be able to get up again.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.867
I glimpsed him, sir,
just up ahead.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.201
Good work, Jones.

04:45.326 --> 04:47.871
He's been on the run.
He'll be tired and hungry.

04:48.788 --> 04:51.958
Try and take him alive,
but if he won't come quietly,

04:52.709 --> 04:54.377
you know what to do.

04:54.502 --> 04:55.670
They don't like it, sir.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.047
- They don't like it.
- Quiet, Jones!

04:58.048 --> 04:59.382
Uh...

05:00.884 --> 05:02.218
Follow me.

05:41.049 --> 05:42.759
Wait for my command.

05:51.726 --> 05:53.269
There he is, sir.

05:54.062 --> 05:55.772
Stand your ground, men.

06:01.236 --> 06:02.404
Jones.

06:02.821 --> 06:06.658
Very slowly,
pass me the halter.

06:09.619 --> 06:10.787
Jones?

06:11.746 --> 06:13.998
Very slowly... Jones.

06:14.124 --> 06:15.291
Jones?

06:22.799 --> 06:25.635
There's a good bull.
Eh. Good bull.

06:33.268 --> 06:34.853
Wilson, do something!

06:35.645 --> 06:37.147
Do what, sir?

06:37.272 --> 06:39.524
Anything!
Just do something!

06:41.985 --> 06:43.028
Godfrey!

06:43.153 --> 06:45.280
<i>Ole. Ole.
</i> Follow me.

06:49.117 --> 06:50.493
Okay, now. Sit. Sit.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.163
He's licking his lips.

06:53.538 --> 06:55.498
He's licking his lips!
Uncle Arthur!

06:55.540 --> 06:57.500
Frank,
pull yourself together!

06:59.461 --> 07:01.379
Behind you, sir,
behind you!

07:01.504 --> 07:02.964
Yes. Help!

07:21.816 --> 07:22.859
Go on, Cedric!

07:22.901 --> 07:23.985
Thank you!

07:25.820 --> 07:27.530
Another successful operation.

07:27.572 --> 07:29.199
Are you out of your tiny, wee mind?

07:29.240 --> 07:31.868
We're supposed to be
locking horns with the hun,

07:31.910 --> 07:33.536
not bertie the bull.

07:34.037 --> 07:37.040
Yes, well, until that day comes, frazer,
we must remain sharp.

07:37.248 --> 07:39.209
- Ah!
- What, like you, for instance?

07:39.542 --> 07:41.169
I thought he was
gonna eat me, uncle Arthur.

07:41.211 --> 07:42.253
Men.

07:42.379 --> 07:43.713
My whole life just
flashed before my eyes.

07:44.339 --> 07:45.382
Men.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.592
Let's get you home.

07:48.259 --> 07:50.220
You never know
when Jerry might strike.

08:31.261 --> 08:34.639
Who do you
think you are kidding, Mr. Churchill?

08:56.661 --> 08:59.289
Attention to detail, ladies!

08:59.414 --> 09:02.083
The sooner we get the wounded
back on their feet,

09:02.125 --> 09:04.294
the sooner
we shall win this war.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.797
How's that, George?

09:08.089 --> 09:09.591
It's really rather painful, dear.

09:09.632 --> 09:12.260
It's your own fault.
You stood on a land mine.

09:13.303 --> 09:14.637
Up a bit.

09:14.763 --> 09:16.431
You've been shot
in the leg, Joe.

09:16.473 --> 09:18.016
I know, but it goes
all the way up to my...

09:19.517 --> 09:21.311
Hold still, you big baby!

09:21.436 --> 09:23.146
I'll not take much more of this.

09:23.188 --> 09:26.191
First, I'm bull bait,
now I'm long John silver!

09:26.316 --> 09:28.610
-Lift your arm, Mr. Godfrey.
-All right.

09:29.110 --> 09:30.528
You've been
shot in the chest.

09:30.653 --> 09:32.364
Have I? Oh, dear.

09:32.489 --> 09:34.491
-Will I be all right?
-Yes.

09:35.950 --> 09:37.535
Wonderful sights.

09:38.161 --> 09:41.831
Man and woman
united in common cause.

09:41.873 --> 09:43.333
Thanks to us.

09:44.125 --> 09:46.336
I don't know
what we'd do without them.

09:46.961 --> 09:48.171
- Captain mainwaring.
- Mmm?

09:48.672 --> 09:49.714
Ah!

09:49.839 --> 09:51.007
Morning, vicar.

09:51.132 --> 09:52.550
Telephone for you.

09:53.009 --> 09:56.554
And the Morris dancers
have booked the hall for 1:00.

09:56.680 --> 09:58.348
I do hope
you're not going to run over.

09:58.473 --> 10:00.558
There is a war on,
you know, vicar.

10:00.684 --> 10:03.520
If we're not finished,
they'll just have to prance about outside.

10:12.529 --> 10:13.822
Mainwaring.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.368
You'll have to speak up.

10:31.381 --> 10:33.216
Colonel theakes, here.

10:34.843 --> 10:35.885
Morning, sir.

10:35.927 --> 10:37.887
<i>Not another bull, is it?</i>

10:40.098 --> 10:43.393
Just had brigadier pritchard
on the blower from hq.

10:45.520 --> 10:47.397
It's all hands on deck.

10:47.522 --> 10:49.524
And how are you today,
Mr. Godfrey?

10:49.566 --> 10:51.401
I've been shot
in the chest, you know.

10:51.443 --> 10:53.403
Have you really?

10:53.445 --> 10:55.905
Well, a nice spot of tea
will do you the world of good.

10:55.947 --> 10:57.032
Oh.

10:57.741 --> 10:59.534
This is a waste of time.

10:59.576 --> 11:02.037
I should be going to France
with the rest of them.

11:02.287 --> 11:04.956
Oh, it's not your fault
you've got flat feet.

11:05.373 --> 11:08.918
People think I'm a boy.
I'm not. I'm a man.

11:09.127 --> 11:10.378
Tea's up.

11:10.420 --> 11:12.297
Ooh, cake!
Bagsy the pink one!

11:12.422 --> 11:13.631
And you know
what he's like.

11:13.757 --> 11:16.551
If he don't get
three square meals a day in him, he cries.

11:16.926 --> 11:17.969
Mainwaring?

11:18.094 --> 11:19.888
Frank. You're not listening, Arthur.

11:20.430 --> 11:23.099
He's taking Vera
to the pictures again tonight.

11:23.224 --> 11:24.309
He's quite smitten with her, he is.

11:24.434 --> 11:25.602
You want some?

11:25.643 --> 11:26.728
Oh.

11:27.103 --> 11:28.938
You might pop around.

11:29.272 --> 11:32.650
I've got a rather
nice pigeon off-rations from Walker.

11:32.776 --> 11:33.985
Oh, it's your favorite bird.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.779
I don't know about that.

11:36.112 --> 11:38.281
Oh, stop it, Arthur.

11:39.324 --> 11:41.451
Listen, men. Listen.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.495
I have excellent news.

11:45.288 --> 11:47.415
Colonel theakes has
given us a new mission.

11:47.457 --> 11:50.168
What is it this time?
Wash his car? Feed his horses?

11:50.293 --> 11:52.629
There's a line in the sand, mainwaring,
and you've crossed it.

11:53.004 --> 11:56.341
He's asked us to patrol
the allied invasion base at Dover.

11:58.259 --> 11:59.678
- Good heavens.
- Blimey.

11:59.803 --> 12:01.429
This is it, men.

12:01.971 --> 12:05.141
Our chance to play
a real part in this war.

12:05.266 --> 12:10.146
At last, captain.
We're champing at our bits, aren't we, lads?

12:10.188 --> 12:11.940
In the meantime,
we shall get back on the downs

12:11.981 --> 12:13.817
for camouflage practice.

12:13.858 --> 12:15.652
Into the Van, men,
at the double.

12:16.486 --> 12:17.570
Did he say cauliflower?

12:17.654 --> 12:18.988
-No, no, camouflage.
-Camouflage.

12:19.030 --> 12:20.990
-Camouflage. Okay.
-Try to listen.

12:34.838 --> 12:37.007
Now, this is just what
the men need, Wilson.

12:38.508 --> 12:41.553
Yes, yes, thank you, Jones.
Thank you, thank you.

12:41.678 --> 12:43.763
Yes, they've been
dragging their feet a bit lately.

12:43.847 --> 12:46.182
Yes, they have been a bit lax.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.727
There's no need
for Latin, Wilson.

12:48.852 --> 12:51.730
If the king's English is good enough
for him, it's good enough for you.

12:51.855 --> 12:53.023
You're not at
Cambridge now, you know.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.025
Oxford, actually, sir.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.235
In the light of
the forthcoming mission,

12:57.360 --> 12:59.738
we shall adapt
today's exercise.

12:59.863 --> 13:01.865
One of the men
shall be a Nazi spy.

13:01.948 --> 13:04.117
We'll drop him off
at the crossroads.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.910
Are you sure that's wise, sir?

13:06.036 --> 13:09.205
Meanwhile, we shall lie in wait
and attempt to intercept him.

13:09.247 --> 13:12.792
Lying in wait
sounds awfully damp, don't you think, sir?

13:15.545 --> 13:17.088
Pull over, Jones.
Pull over, Jones.

13:17.213 --> 13:18.590
Pulling over, sir.

13:18.715 --> 13:20.133
I want
a word with you, Wilson.

13:26.890 --> 13:29.434
How dare you question
my authority in front of the men?

13:29.559 --> 13:31.478
Well, I just don't want
anyone catching a cold.

13:31.561 --> 13:32.729
You know what frank's like.

13:32.896 --> 13:33.897
Are we nearly there yet?

13:33.980 --> 13:35.607
As you were, pike.

13:35.732 --> 13:37.776
You're trying to undermine me,
usurp my position.

13:37.901 --> 13:39.819
I'm really doing
nothing of the kind.

13:40.403 --> 13:42.614
Hurry up.
Godfrey's gotta go.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.158
Yes, well,
it won't work, you know.

13:45.575 --> 13:46.910
These pips say it all.

13:46.993 --> 13:50.163
You waft along with that
superior look on your face.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.790
No backbone,
that's your trouble.

13:51.915 --> 13:53.792
Well, I'm not sure
that's entirely fair.

13:53.917 --> 13:56.586
Really? Well, here's
your chance to prove it.

13:58.755 --> 14:00.423
You're our Nazi for the day.

14:02.092 --> 14:04.260
- Really?
<i>- Auf wiedersehen,</i> Mr. Wilson.

14:23.279 --> 14:25.990
Very good, men.
Breaking up the outline.

14:30.328 --> 14:32.997
You're not taking this seriously,
are you, Walker?

14:33.623 --> 14:34.874
How'd you know it was me?

14:36.793 --> 14:38.628
No, thank you, pike.

14:40.296 --> 14:41.339
Ah!

14:41.464 --> 14:43.008
You put some
thought into this, Jones.

14:43.133 --> 14:44.968
Thank you, captain.

14:45.051 --> 14:48.680
Mrs. fox lent it me
from last year's production of <i>Robin hood.</i>

14:48.805 --> 14:51.057
I'm a tiny bit
of Sherwood forest.

14:51.141 --> 14:52.183
Ah...

14:55.812 --> 14:56.980
Godfrey?

14:58.314 --> 15:01.026
You look like
you're on a cruise to the south seas.

15:01.151 --> 15:03.236
Thank you so much, sir.
That's very kind of you.

15:03.319 --> 15:08.241
I got the idea from a picture
i saw last week, <i>south of pago pago.</i>

15:08.324 --> 15:10.368
I thought it was
rather open air.

15:10.493 --> 15:11.995
Take it off.

15:12.078 --> 15:14.372
Captain, might I be excused, please?

15:14.497 --> 15:15.874
Certainly not.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.501
Now, listen, men.

15:18.585 --> 15:22.839
Sergeant Wilson's mission
is to reach our flag undetected.

15:24.257 --> 15:27.344
So, we all need
to keep our eyes peeled at all times.

15:27.719 --> 15:30.513
Listen! Something's coming.

15:31.765 --> 15:35.602
If I know Wilson,
he'll have charmed his way into a lift.

15:36.519 --> 15:39.773
Conceal yourselves, men.
Wait for my signal.

15:44.903 --> 15:45.945
Oh.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.205
What's up, Mr. Godfrey?

15:56.414 --> 15:57.457
Ah...

15:59.209 --> 16:00.251
Oh...

16:04.381 --> 16:06.883
Good lord.
At the double, men!

16:10.053 --> 16:12.889
Halt, Nazi spy, or get all shot.

16:15.558 --> 16:17.811
Madam, I'm most terribly sorry.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.563
I thought I saw a tree move.

16:20.647 --> 16:21.981
I had to, captain.

16:22.399 --> 16:25.402
Mr. Godfrey wanted to
use me as a convenience.

16:25.443 --> 16:28.738
I'm afraid my call of nature
called rather loudly.

16:30.073 --> 16:32.242
I fear we mistook you
for a Nazi spy.

16:33.827 --> 16:35.453
Yes, thank you, Walker.

16:36.913 --> 16:39.416
Miss winters,
associated press.

16:39.457 --> 16:42.168
Captain mainwaring,
walmington home guard.

16:42.252 --> 16:43.753
What a coincidence.

16:44.129 --> 16:46.756
I'm doing an article
on the home guard of walmington-on-sea.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.425
For <i>the lady</i> magazine.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.510
Us? In a real magazine?

16:50.593 --> 16:52.262
We're going up
in the world, lads.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.139
Well, you come
highly recommended.

16:54.764 --> 16:56.474
Yes, well,
i certainly like to think

16:56.599 --> 16:58.476
we'd give Jerry
a run for his money.

16:59.269 --> 17:00.603
You've joined us in mid-operation.

17:00.937 --> 17:02.188
We're on the lookout for a spy.

17:02.272 --> 17:04.190
But don't worry,
we'll catch him.

17:04.273 --> 17:06.608
Not much gets past us,
i can tell you.

17:07.944 --> 17:08.987
Uh...

17:09.279 --> 17:10.613
You're nasty.

17:11.948 --> 17:13.450
Would you like a stab?

17:18.288 --> 17:19.955
Permission to speak, sir.

17:20.123 --> 17:21.790
-What is it, Jones?
-Well, this bag.

17:22.125 --> 17:24.877
It doesn't exactly
bring my blood to the boil.

17:24.961 --> 17:28.840
Well, I could stand
behind if you like. I speak a little German.

17:28.965 --> 17:31.801
Is that true, Godfrey?
Shall have to keep an eye on him.

17:31.885 --> 17:34.304
Yes, one of my
nannies was from leipzig.

17:34.346 --> 17:35.972
Beautiful woman.
Greta, her name was.

17:36.014 --> 17:38.475
All right, all right,
get behind the sack!

17:38.808 --> 17:42.395
Now, incense me
in the Nazi tongue.

17:44.647 --> 17:48.651
You Nazi pig dog, you!
I strike you thusly!

17:49.903 --> 17:50.987
And thusly!

17:52.405 --> 17:53.907
Excellent, Jones.

17:53.990 --> 17:55.492
Hey,
don't put your back out, mind.

17:55.533 --> 17:56.576
What did you say, Godfrey?

17:56.659 --> 17:58.078
What? What, sir?

17:58.161 --> 18:01.164
I said,
"have you brushed your teeth, my angel?"

18:01.247 --> 18:03.833
You see, I never used to
like brushing my own teeth.

18:03.875 --> 18:05.335
All right, Godfrey.
All right, all right.

18:05.377 --> 18:06.836
She would do it
for me, sometimes.

18:06.878 --> 18:08.088
Yes, all right.
Thank you, Godfrey.

18:08.171 --> 18:09.839
Carry on, corporal.
Very good, Godfrey.

18:09.881 --> 18:11.925
All right, men.
Assume position!

18:12.008 --> 18:13.051
First group, ready!

18:13.259 --> 18:14.511
And charge!

18:18.348 --> 18:19.432
Second group, ready!

18:19.516 --> 18:21.851
It's a privilege
to watch you all.

18:21.893 --> 18:22.936
Ah...

18:23.520 --> 18:26.022
They're a decent bunch.
We do what we can.

18:26.690 --> 18:28.900
They'd clearly do
anything for you.

18:30.527 --> 18:32.028
Must be that smile.

18:36.866 --> 18:39.411
Where on earth has
my sergeant got to?

18:39.536 --> 18:40.787
Anyone for honey?

18:42.706 --> 18:44.958
-Wilson?
-It is, actually, sir.

18:45.041 --> 18:46.376
How the dickens
did you evade that...

18:46.418 --> 18:48.420
I do believe I won
the exercise, sir.

18:48.545 --> 18:50.630
You did nothing
of the sort, not dressed like that.

18:50.714 --> 18:51.756
You're disqualified.

18:51.881 --> 18:53.425
I thought I was
being resourceful.

18:53.550 --> 18:55.218
You were being
devious and underhand.

18:55.260 --> 18:56.928
It's no way for
a spy to behave.

18:57.595 --> 18:58.722
Rose?

19:00.432 --> 19:01.558
It can't be!

19:03.810 --> 19:05.228
Arthur?

19:06.896 --> 19:08.481
What a remarkable thing.

19:09.983 --> 19:11.484
I'm sorry, captain.

19:12.068 --> 19:14.571
Mr. Wilson was my tutor at Oxford.

19:15.071 --> 19:16.406
Remarkable.

19:16.740 --> 19:17.782
Uh...

19:17.907 --> 19:19.451
Wilson, take the men home.

19:19.576 --> 19:22.454
I shall be driving
miss winters up to Sully point.

19:22.579 --> 19:23.913
Oh, might I, sir?

19:23.997 --> 19:26.666
-We have such a great deal to catch up on.
-Certainly not.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.337
Oh, captain, please, I insist.

19:30.420 --> 19:32.839
I've taken up far
too much of your time.

19:32.922 --> 19:35.258
Well, if that's what you'd prefer.

19:35.342 --> 19:36.593
Wilson.

19:37.385 --> 19:39.512
-Shall we?
-My earring.

19:39.596 --> 19:41.848
My earring,
I've dropped it. It's very precious.

19:41.931 --> 19:43.850
-Fan out, men. Fan out.
-Oh, no.

19:43.933 --> 19:45.018
Earring alert.
Earring alert.

19:45.101 --> 19:46.186
I absolutely must find it.

19:46.269 --> 19:48.104
Earring!
Fan out! Earring!

19:48.188 --> 19:49.397
What are we
looking for exactly?

19:49.481 --> 19:50.648
Earring! Earring!

19:50.732 --> 19:52.192
Earring alert.
Fan out, men.

19:52.275 --> 19:53.943
Oh, I've got it.
Here it is. Here it is.

19:54.652 --> 19:55.695
- I'm frank.
- Well done, pike.

19:55.779 --> 19:58.281
-Frank pike.
-Oh, my knight in shining armor.

19:58.365 --> 19:59.407
Ooh.

20:00.450 --> 20:04.788
Well, I look forward to getting to know
you more in the coming days.

20:05.455 --> 20:09.668
England can sleep soundly
knowing that you're watching over her.

20:10.126 --> 20:12.128
-Sir.
-Thank you.

20:17.467 --> 20:19.010
Bye-bye.

20:19.094 --> 20:20.428
- Cheerio.
- Bye.

20:42.659 --> 20:43.702
Is that everything?

20:43.827 --> 20:45.954
-Ah. Allow me.
-Oh, no, it's...

20:46.037 --> 20:47.163
-No, it's...
-It's my, it's my...

20:47.247 --> 20:49.249
-No, I'll, I'll...
-It's my typewriter.

20:49.332 --> 20:51.835
-Oh.
-I want to get a start on the article.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.545
First impressions,
you understand.

20:54.754 --> 20:55.797
Hmm.

20:56.172 --> 20:58.675
Might we have tea tomorrow?
Say 5:00?

20:58.758 --> 20:59.843
Well, that would be...

20:59.926 --> 21:03.263
Oh, no, there's a briefing
on some patrol thingy.

21:03.346 --> 21:06.099
-Patrol?
-Yes, of the Dover base.

21:06.850 --> 21:08.435
Dinner afterwards, then?

21:08.518 --> 21:09.894
There must be
somewhere in town.

21:10.520 --> 21:13.398
Well, yes,
there's the oak hotel, but...

21:13.481 --> 21:15.900
7:00. I insist.

21:16.359 --> 21:18.153
Right. Yes.

21:18.570 --> 21:21.281
How nice. Thank you, rose.

21:22.407 --> 21:23.450
Goodbye.

21:23.533 --> 21:24.576
Goodbye.

21:25.368 --> 21:26.411
Oh.

21:39.507 --> 21:41.676
I want you to have
a word with frank.

21:41.760 --> 21:44.429
He's got it into his head
he wants to be a spitfire pilot.

21:44.512 --> 21:46.556
He gets dizzy
standing on a chair.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.725
Well, he lives in his head,
that's his trouble.

21:49.768 --> 21:50.810
Ah.

21:51.728 --> 21:53.229
Must have been a racer.

21:54.022 --> 21:55.523
Where do you keep your...

21:59.110 --> 22:01.821
He told me about
that journalist woman.

22:03.490 --> 22:04.699
Arthur?

22:05.700 --> 22:07.827
Shall I roll out the pastry?

22:08.244 --> 22:09.371
Frank said
you drove her home.

22:09.454 --> 22:10.580
Did I?

22:10.663 --> 22:12.499
Oh, yes, that's right,
i believe I did.

22:12.582 --> 22:13.667
Ever so glamorous, frank said.

22:13.750 --> 22:16.294
Really? I hadn't noticed.

22:16.836 --> 22:19.756
Just you remember
which side your bread's buttered.

22:21.174 --> 22:22.217
Pass me that bird.

22:22.300 --> 22:23.593
Here you go.

22:29.140 --> 22:31.976
Thank you for taking me
to the pictures again, frank. It was...

22:32.060 --> 22:33.395
It was ever so romantic.

22:33.478 --> 22:34.521
Thanks for
walking me home.

22:34.604 --> 22:37.023
Mum doesn't like me
being out after dark.

22:39.734 --> 22:40.777
Ooh.

22:42.946 --> 22:44.239
What're you doing?

22:44.322 --> 22:46.282
Kissing you.
What's wrong with that?

22:46.991 --> 22:49.411
People only kiss
like that in the films!

22:49.494 --> 22:51.287
That's what you think.

23:43.882 --> 23:46.760
Morning, miss winters.
Corporal Jones.

23:46.843 --> 23:48.386
A butcher by trade.

23:48.470 --> 23:49.512
But a soldier by nature, ma'am.

23:50.764 --> 23:53.683
More notches on my rifle
than you've had hot dinners.

23:54.392 --> 23:56.144
Not that you've had
too many hot dinners.

23:56.227 --> 23:58.897
You've a fine fettle
of a figure, if I may say.

23:59.356 --> 24:00.482
Here.

24:01.191 --> 24:02.484
Welcome to walmington.

24:02.567 --> 24:03.860
Thank you, Mr. Jones.

24:04.069 --> 24:05.195
Good day.

24:07.572 --> 24:08.948
I saw that, Jack Jones.

24:09.032 --> 24:10.742
You just slipped her a sausage.

24:10.825 --> 24:11.993
I didn't mean nothing by it.

24:12.077 --> 24:13.578
And you never stamped
her book, neither.

24:14.371 --> 24:15.622
Good morning.

24:15.705 --> 24:17.248
Lovely morning.

24:17.874 --> 24:19.959
Quite, quite lovely.

24:20.210 --> 24:22.337
Daphne longfoot.
Charmed, I'm sure.

24:22.420 --> 24:24.422
Rose. Rose winters.

24:25.131 --> 24:26.758
You look busy, mister...

24:26.841 --> 24:28.218
Frazer. Frazer.

24:28.301 --> 24:31.179
Yes, well,
with the invasion any day now,

24:31.262 --> 24:33.306
I expect business
to be brisk.

24:33.390 --> 24:34.557
Yes.

24:38.353 --> 24:40.522
Private Walker.
Call me Joe.

24:40.772 --> 24:44.275
Very young for the home guard, Joe.
Didn't you enlist?

24:44.359 --> 24:45.527
Color blind.

24:45.694 --> 24:47.904
-Oh.
-Thought it was an allergy to corned beef.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.447
Yeah, that and all.

24:52.909 --> 24:53.952
All right, lads?

24:56.705 --> 24:58.998
You need anything
for that article of yours, miss winters,

24:59.082 --> 25:01.418
foolscap, ribbons,
you just let me know.

25:01.501 --> 25:02.752
Will do.

25:03.211 --> 25:05.005
Bonny, bonny lass.

25:05.422 --> 25:07.590
William Hodges, ma'am,
air-raid warden.

25:08.133 --> 25:11.636
Of course, it's me you
should be talking to, not the home guard.

25:11.720 --> 25:13.722
I'm the one who gets
things done around here.

25:13.805 --> 25:16.016
-Gas masks, air-raid warnings...
-We are in your debt.

25:16.474 --> 25:17.600
I'm rushed off me feet.

25:17.684 --> 25:19.227
-Cheerio.
-Ta-ta.

25:21.354 --> 25:23.940
Look at the color, the cut.

25:26.234 --> 25:28.111
I'm telling you, it's Chanel.

25:28.194 --> 25:29.529
I'd know it anywhere.

25:29.612 --> 25:31.197
Chanel in walmington?

25:31.281 --> 25:33.408
She seems
ever so interested in hearing about

25:33.491 --> 25:35.910
your brother's cabbages,
miss Godfrey.

25:35.994 --> 25:38.705
She seems most civilized.

25:39.080 --> 25:41.207
They said that about the ripper.

25:42.167 --> 25:44.252
I won the war
against snails this year.

25:44.419 --> 25:45.962
Salt, that's the answer.

25:46.046 --> 25:47.172
Salt?

25:47.756 --> 25:48.965
Carry on.

25:51.009 --> 25:52.469
She'll be taking our men next.

25:53.970 --> 25:57.599
Mr. sponge said she
kissed your frank, and not on the cheek.

25:57.849 --> 25:59.726
I'd look closer to home
if I was you, Mrs. fox.

25:59.809 --> 26:00.852
She had a big smile
on her face

26:00.935 --> 26:02.479
when she came out
that butcher's just now.

26:02.562 --> 26:03.938
What's that
supposed to mean?

26:14.616 --> 26:16.368
Handsome woman.

26:16.785 --> 26:18.453
Is she?

26:18.536 --> 26:20.080
Wouldn't know.

26:20.538 --> 26:22.040
Seems a good sort.

26:22.749 --> 26:25.043
To be writing about us, I mean.

26:26.044 --> 26:30.548
Seeing her again after
so long is really rather discombobulating.

26:32.008 --> 26:34.010
Well, you know, confusing.

26:34.177 --> 26:37.555
Yes, I know what discombob...
Discombobu...

26:38.264 --> 26:39.724
I know what it means, Wilson.

26:42.852 --> 26:44.604
So, you knew her at Oxford.

26:45.271 --> 26:47.273
I was her tutor for a while.

26:47.524 --> 26:49.401
But you two weren't...

26:50.652 --> 26:51.903
Weren't...

26:52.654 --> 26:55.490
Well, it looked
like maybe you were...

26:56.157 --> 26:57.492
Were...

26:57.575 --> 27:00.078
Or had been, you know.

27:01.162 --> 27:02.205
Hmm?

27:02.372 --> 27:03.415
Oh.

27:03.540 --> 27:06.251
That? No! No, no, no.

27:06.751 --> 27:08.837
-Good lord, no.
-Jolly good.

27:09.462 --> 27:10.922
Important we're clear.

27:11.923 --> 27:13.842
Parade at 6:00. Don't be late.

27:14.676 --> 27:16.302
- Morning.
- Good morning.

27:16.386 --> 27:18.221
Take these
through to the cashier, would you, Wilson?

27:18.304 --> 27:19.848
Certainly, sir.

27:34.237 --> 27:37.824
What are you doing, pike?
Stupid...

27:39.451 --> 27:41.619
Platoon, fall in!

27:43.955 --> 27:47.334
Platoon, right turn!

27:47.959 --> 27:51.004
Two, three, one!
By the left.

27:51.796 --> 27:53.715
Quick march!

27:55.383 --> 27:56.426
Uh...

27:57.177 --> 28:00.764
Mr. frazer,
Mr. Godfrey, about turn!

28:00.847 --> 28:01.973
Sorry, everyone.

28:02.140 --> 28:05.643
Platoon, right turn!

28:07.812 --> 28:09.898
Now, miss winters,

28:11.441 --> 28:12.776
may I say,

28:13.735 --> 28:15.820
you do look lovely tonight.

28:16.154 --> 28:17.447
I beg your pardon.

28:18.448 --> 28:19.491
Ah!

28:19.574 --> 28:20.909
Colonel.

28:20.992 --> 28:22.911
I didn't mean you look lovely.

28:22.994 --> 28:25.580
No, no, no,
of course not. Far from it.

28:25.663 --> 28:29.751
Not that you look unlovely.
I'm sure to many you are lovely.

28:29.876 --> 28:31.961
Not really my area.

28:32.045 --> 28:33.296
About the patrol.

28:33.380 --> 28:35.423
Ah. Yes, a great honor.

28:35.507 --> 28:37.967
Sergeant Wilson
will be here any moment for your briefing.

28:38.385 --> 28:41.930
We'll crack on without him.
Golf club do. Wife in the car.

28:42.013 --> 28:43.223
Your orders are simple, mainwaring.

28:43.306 --> 28:45.392
You're to stick
to the coastal path at all times.

28:45.475 --> 28:47.519
Do not approach
the base in any way. Understood?

28:47.602 --> 28:49.437
Not approach the base?
But surely we need...

28:49.521 --> 28:51.314
Are you questioning
an order, mainwaring?

28:52.565 --> 28:54.943
As you know,
the home guard have been asked for cuts

28:55.026 --> 28:56.611
to help with
the big push into France.

28:56.695 --> 28:57.737
Has it?

28:57.821 --> 28:59.364
We'll be reviewing the troops.

28:59.447 --> 29:01.866
Sorting the wheat from
the chaff, as it were.

29:02.367 --> 29:04.119
I won't beat about the bush.

29:04.619 --> 29:06.579
Walmington feels chaffy.

29:07.205 --> 29:09.833
My men are as
keen as mustard, sir.

29:11.668 --> 29:13.461
Your sergeant
doesn't seem to be.

29:14.587 --> 29:19.050
First patrol,
this Saturday, 0900. Put on a good show.

29:19.134 --> 29:22.053
There's no better way
of saving the platoon.

29:22.595 --> 29:23.680
Must dash.

29:26.891 --> 29:31.146
We should get together
sometime, play a round with the wives.

29:33.523 --> 29:35.275
Barbara loves a four-ball.

29:37.777 --> 29:39.070
Carry on, old man.

29:43.033 --> 29:44.409
Chaffy.

29:44.784 --> 29:47.287
Platoon, fall in!

29:48.455 --> 29:50.165
Attention!

29:52.709 --> 29:54.252
Where is sergeant Wilson?

29:54.669 --> 29:55.837
In bed,
i shouldn't wonder.

29:55.920 --> 29:57.130
Caught a chill
up on the downs.

29:57.547 --> 29:58.882
Poppycock.

29:58.965 --> 30:00.508
Saw him coming out
of the gent's outfitters

30:00.592 --> 30:02.385
on the high street
just an hour ago

30:02.469 --> 30:05.430
looking happier
than a kitten on a cow's udder.

30:08.224 --> 30:10.226
-I like your tie.
-What?

30:10.727 --> 30:12.354
Oh, really? This? Do you?

30:12.437 --> 30:13.563
Well, it's just a...
Pfft.

30:14.939 --> 30:17.859
I often thought of you
over the years, Arthur.

30:18.443 --> 30:22.614
Teaching, whitehall, perhaps,
but never in walmington-on-sea.

30:23.156 --> 30:24.449
Well, it has its charms.

30:25.325 --> 30:27.118
You were such
a good teacher, Arthur.

30:27.202 --> 30:29.496
Well, I don't remember
teaching you anything.

30:29.579 --> 30:31.039
You seemed to
know it all already.

30:31.664 --> 30:34.042
You were so handsome,
dashing...

30:34.125 --> 30:36.086
I haven't dashed
anywhere for years.

30:38.088 --> 30:40.382
Age has only
improved you, Arthur.

30:40.674 --> 30:42.050
Well...

30:51.893 --> 30:55.021
Well, I better be off.

30:55.105 --> 30:58.191
That night
at the summer ball, do you remember?

31:07.450 --> 31:09.452
I so wanted you to kiss me.

31:13.081 --> 31:14.833
Didn't you want to kiss me?

31:15.458 --> 31:17.293
Well, I suppose.

31:17.377 --> 31:19.129
Well, I was your tutor,

31:19.212 --> 31:21.089
and there were rules.

31:21.172 --> 31:23.133
Oh. Rules.

31:23.842 --> 31:26.553
Strangled the life
out of this country.

31:28.888 --> 31:31.391
Tell me about your briefing
with colonel theakes.

31:31.516 --> 31:32.892
I didn't go.

31:32.976 --> 31:34.019
Oh.

31:34.519 --> 31:36.730
But I want to write about
your patrol in my article.

31:36.813 --> 31:38.732
Don't worry.
Mainwaring will tell you everything tomorrow.

31:38.815 --> 31:40.525
You'll have a job stopping him.

31:46.865 --> 31:48.199
Chaffy.

31:48.742 --> 31:49.951
Chaffy.

31:51.202 --> 31:53.997
My platoon is not chaffy.

31:54.748 --> 31:56.416
Public school boy.

31:56.541 --> 31:57.584
Mmm?

31:58.918 --> 32:02.505
Yeah, theakes has
met his match with me.

32:03.757 --> 32:08.678
I shall make sure
miss winters' article is so glowing about us,

32:08.762 --> 32:11.181
they'll have to pin
medals on the lot of us.

32:12.515 --> 32:13.933
Come to bed.

32:15.935 --> 32:17.687
I'm on top tonight.

32:22.692 --> 32:24.944
I'm asleep, George.

32:38.375 --> 32:40.085
Sleep well, dear.

32:40.210 --> 32:41.711
I'll be lucky.

32:43.588 --> 32:45.298
Trapped wind again.

33:03.149 --> 33:04.484
Arthur.

33:05.110 --> 33:06.152
Oh.

33:09.114 --> 33:10.156
Good morning.

33:10.240 --> 33:11.783
Ah. Good morning.

33:12.992 --> 33:14.452
Where was you last night?

33:14.536 --> 33:17.706
Oh. Last night
as in last night?

33:17.789 --> 33:18.998
You was at the oak
with miss winters.

33:19.082 --> 33:20.250
Was I?

33:20.333 --> 33:22.293
Oh, yes,
that's right, I was, yeah.

33:22.836 --> 33:24.921
Catching up on old times.

33:25.005 --> 33:26.047
Oh...

33:27.215 --> 33:28.591
-You look dreadful.
-Well.

33:28.675 --> 33:30.301
You didn't come
for your breakfast.

33:31.344 --> 33:35.056
Good lord,
I'm late for work.

33:35.140 --> 33:37.976
Mrs. Todd said
you proper pushed the boat out.

33:38.059 --> 33:39.853
Woolton pie, jam roly-poly.

33:39.936 --> 33:41.980
Mavis, you have
nothing to worry about.

33:42.063 --> 33:43.690
I promise you.

33:44.524 --> 33:47.360
If you want roly-poly, Arthur,
I'll give you roly-poly.

33:48.403 --> 33:52.157
And my roly-poly
will knock her roly-poly into a cocked hat.

33:52.949 --> 33:55.201
8:00, after parade,
roly-poly.

33:55.952 --> 33:57.037
Mmm.

33:58.038 --> 33:59.372
Don't be late.

34:02.792 --> 34:04.627
Roly-poly.

34:13.303 --> 34:14.471
Oh, miss winters.

34:14.596 --> 34:16.306
I say, miss winters.

34:17.223 --> 34:20.268
We're so confused,
aren't we, cissy?

34:20.560 --> 34:24.147
Our brother, Charles,
told us that you're writing an article

34:24.272 --> 34:28.068
on the home guard
for <i>the lady</i> magazine.

34:28.150 --> 34:30.152
-Yes.
-But they just did one.

34:30.235 --> 34:32.155
We subscribe, you see.

34:32.405 --> 34:35.158
-And they never do two of anything.
-No.

34:36.076 --> 34:38.161
It's a follow-up article.

34:38.244 --> 34:40.330
The first was so well received,
they commissioned another.

34:40.580 --> 34:41.623
Oh.

34:42.916 --> 34:45.168
Well,
that would explain it.

34:45.335 --> 34:47.003
Excuse me, ladies.

34:47.253 --> 34:48.463
Captain mainwaring.

34:49.089 --> 34:50.130
Ah!

34:50.172 --> 34:53.259
Miss winters.
What a pleasant surprise.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.594
I was on my way to see you.
Are you busy?

34:55.844 --> 34:58.515
My little break.
Perhaps you'd join me.

34:58.973 --> 35:01.267
They do a very
passable Chelsea bun.

35:01.351 --> 35:02.602
I'd be delighted.

35:03.353 --> 35:04.938
Better before the war,
of course.

35:05.021 --> 35:07.607
These days, it's a case
of "spot the currant."

35:08.692 --> 35:10.527
But one mustn't grumble.

35:24.207 --> 35:25.291
Mmm...

35:25.709 --> 35:27.210
I do like your dress,
miss winters.

35:27.335 --> 35:29.212
Oh, thank you, Vera.

35:29.337 --> 35:31.172
You can have the
pattern if you like.

35:31.506 --> 35:32.716
Oh.

35:33.049 --> 35:35.385
Well, I don't know what to say.

35:37.178 --> 35:38.221
Oh.

35:38.346 --> 35:39.472
Good of you.

35:39.556 --> 35:41.391
Well, a woman should
always look her best,

35:41.474 --> 35:44.060
especially at wartime,
don't you agree?

35:44.185 --> 35:46.312
I think you do, splendidly.

35:49.024 --> 35:53.194
I'm keen for you to
get to know the platoon,

35:53.236 --> 35:56.072
-not just as soldiers but as men.
-Mmm.

35:56.322 --> 35:59.743
Brave, dedicated,
honest to a fault.

36:00.160 --> 36:01.536
Nylons, miss winters?

36:01.578 --> 36:03.329
Fresh off the back of a lorry,
if you know what I mean.

36:03.413 --> 36:06.374
Walker, miss winters
and I are discussing military matters.

36:06.666 --> 36:08.168
Of course you are!

36:08.501 --> 36:09.753
Life in the old dog yet, ey?

36:10.420 --> 36:11.546
Yeah.

36:15.383 --> 36:16.593
Arms to the shoulder line!

36:17.510 --> 36:19.596
Left, right, left, right.

36:20.597 --> 36:23.933
In short, I shall do
everything in my power

36:24.059 --> 36:28.188
to make your article
as informative and positive as possible.

36:29.606 --> 36:30.774
Are you?

36:30.899 --> 36:32.067
Oh, yes.

36:32.942 --> 36:33.943
Thank you.

36:34.069 --> 36:38.365
Well, I expect nothing less
from a natural leader like yourself.

36:38.615 --> 36:39.783
Well, I...

36:39.866 --> 36:44.079
Would you mind
just taking off your spectacles for me?

36:45.080 --> 36:46.581
Whatever for?

36:47.874 --> 36:49.209
Very well.

36:50.293 --> 36:51.378
Ah.

36:52.420 --> 36:54.130
I knew it.

36:54.255 --> 36:55.465
There's a glint.

36:57.300 --> 36:59.427
A certain fire in the eyes.

37:01.971 --> 37:03.306
You remind me of someone.

37:03.390 --> 37:04.474
Really?

37:04.599 --> 37:05.642
I wonder who that could be.

37:05.767 --> 37:07.394
Churchill.

37:07.477 --> 37:09.396
Winston Churchill.

37:09.479 --> 37:11.981
-Really?
-You have so many of his qualities.

37:12.482 --> 37:14.609
Never given it much thought,

37:15.902 --> 37:17.153
but I suppose I do.

37:17.237 --> 37:18.446
It's uncanny!

37:20.156 --> 37:23.660
I like to think
that if we met,

37:23.785 --> 37:25.995
we'd both be
the richer for it.

37:26.121 --> 37:27.288
Oh, yes.

37:28.456 --> 37:30.792
Why don't you join us
at parade tonight?

37:30.959 --> 37:35.130
I shall be briefing the platoon
on the patrol, stiffening their resolve,

37:36.256 --> 37:40.301
and endeavoring
to inspire them in some small way, perhaps.

37:44.639 --> 37:47.142
Well. Until tonight, then.

37:58.111 --> 37:59.362
Good god.

38:00.196 --> 38:01.614
Eyes front!

38:24.846 --> 38:25.972
What's that, Wilson?

38:26.139 --> 38:27.182
Oh.

38:27.515 --> 38:29.851
Nothing. What's that, sir?

38:31.811 --> 38:32.854
Nothing.

38:38.318 --> 38:39.527
Fall the men in, Jones.

38:39.569 --> 38:43.406
Platoon, fall in!

38:47.869 --> 38:50.205
Attention!

38:55.585 --> 38:59.089
Sorry I'm late.
I was writing up my notes, captain.

38:59.214 --> 39:00.924
I quite understand.

39:01.508 --> 39:04.219
As Julius Caesar
himself once said,

39:04.844 --> 39:07.263
"preparation is all."

39:08.014 --> 39:09.683
One of my inspirations,
you know.

39:09.766 --> 39:11.393
Murdered by his own men.

39:12.602 --> 39:15.522
-Thank you.
-Conquered all before him.

39:15.605 --> 39:19.526
You know, <i>veni, vidi...</i>

39:20.276 --> 39:21.361
Eh...

39:21.903 --> 39:23.029
Gather around.

39:26.032 --> 39:27.909
-Evening, miss winters.
-Good evening.

39:31.371 --> 39:33.456
Now, listen, men.

39:34.541 --> 39:36.960
You all know,
you can ask me...

39:47.387 --> 39:50.306
You all know that you
can ask me anything,

39:50.432 --> 39:54.394
be it of a professional,
pastoral, or indeed,

39:55.645 --> 39:57.731
a philosophical nature.

39:58.106 --> 40:00.233
I have a question, captain.

40:01.317 --> 40:04.320
What if life is
really a dream?

40:04.988 --> 40:07.407
When I said philosophical,
what I meant was...

40:07.490 --> 40:09.409
I worry about
that sometimes, sir,

40:09.492 --> 40:13.329
that we're all of us,
nothing but the dancing spirits of the night.

40:13.455 --> 40:15.165
-Jones.
-I'm not sure I like that idea.

40:15.290 --> 40:16.624
What, the spirits or the dancing?

40:16.666 --> 40:18.835
Just thinking about it
is giving me goosebumps. Look.

40:18.918 --> 40:20.170
When you're dead, you're dead.

40:20.253 --> 40:24.966
I've never buried anybody yet who
wasn't. Well, maybe, just the once.

40:25.467 --> 40:28.762
Wouldn't it be terrible, sir,
if none of us really existed?

40:28.845 --> 40:30.513
I mean, who would I sell
my sausages to?

40:30.638 --> 40:32.932
If life's a dream, jonesy,
you'd still have to be alive,

40:33.016 --> 40:34.517
so you could fall asleep
and dream they're buying them.

40:34.642 --> 40:36.353
Yes, thank you, Walker.

40:36.478 --> 40:38.646
Walker! Settle down.
Settle down, men.

40:38.688 --> 40:39.981
Settle down.

40:40.440 --> 40:42.275
Now, men.

40:42.609 --> 40:43.818
Uh, Wilson.

40:45.862 --> 40:48.281
Now, men, I have...

40:50.200 --> 40:51.201
Oh.

40:56.664 --> 40:58.041
What's up with his face?

40:58.166 --> 40:59.834
Rigor mortis, with a bit of luck.

41:05.048 --> 41:09.886
Now, men, I have decided
after due and diligent deliberation,

41:10.053 --> 41:14.557
to pinpoint
our preliminary patrol position, here.

41:14.641 --> 41:17.018
In the middle
of the channel. That's interesting.

41:17.060 --> 41:19.062
You need some
new specs, captain?

41:19.145 --> 41:20.313
I've got some lovely ones
just come in.

41:20.563 --> 41:21.564
Uh...

41:22.524 --> 41:25.735
Here, and end it...

41:26.194 --> 41:27.237
Ah!

41:27.320 --> 41:28.988
Here.

41:32.033 --> 41:33.326
- Wilson!
- All right, sir?

41:48.508 --> 41:52.095
We shall patrol in pairs.

41:52.220 --> 41:56.016
So, it would be awfully nice
if you could stay on the lookout

41:56.099 --> 41:58.518
for enemy agents
and that sort of thing.

41:58.601 --> 42:02.355
Yes, my sergeant and i
will now demonstrate.

42:02.939 --> 42:04.190
Wilson.

42:08.903 --> 42:14.117
Observe how keenly
we scan the land, the sea, and the sky.

42:14.868 --> 42:18.913
Alert to attack
from every quarter, like coiled Springs.

42:19.372 --> 42:20.957
All Springs are coiled, Wilson.

42:21.624 --> 42:23.710
Look! I see something.

42:23.793 --> 42:25.795
- Almost had my eye out.
- A parachutist.

42:25.879 --> 42:27.464
Well, I saw him at
the same time as you, sir.

42:27.547 --> 42:29.466
You don't need to point,
i was doing the pointing.

42:29.549 --> 42:30.967
Two dogs, one bone.

42:31.092 --> 42:32.218
In one jock.

42:32.302 --> 42:33.887
When I'm already pointing.

42:33.970 --> 42:35.805
One moment, men.

42:36.306 --> 42:37.640
Come along.

42:42.479 --> 42:43.938
What on earth is the matter?

42:43.980 --> 42:45.732
I'm not sure
what you mean, sir.

42:45.815 --> 42:48.943
You're all puffed up.
Trying to impress miss winters?

42:49.652 --> 42:51.654
I thought that
was what you wanted.

42:51.821 --> 42:53.323
Copying everything I do?

42:53.448 --> 42:56.493
Stop it this instant.
That's an order.

43:00.663 --> 43:01.998
-Any questions?
-Any questions?

43:04.167 --> 43:05.752
We need a pose.

43:05.835 --> 43:06.961
Beg your pardon?

43:07.170 --> 43:09.005
Well, we're going
to be in a magazine.

43:09.089 --> 43:11.925
We need a pose,
something heroic but menacing,

43:12.133 --> 43:14.344
like errol Flynn
in <i>the sea hawk.</i>

43:21.601 --> 43:22.852
Stupid boy.

43:23.269 --> 43:24.354
How about this?

43:25.021 --> 43:26.690
There won't be
any need for poses.

43:26.815 --> 43:28.858
Miss winters won't be
joining us on patrol.

43:29.025 --> 43:31.111
- What?
- Order, order.

43:31.194 --> 43:32.529
Men, men. Order, please.

43:32.654 --> 43:37.367
Only authorized personnel
will be joining us on the coastal path.

43:37.701 --> 43:41.204
Platoon is the
subject of her article, not the patrol.

43:41.705 --> 43:45.375
I understand one or two of you have brought
along some personal items

43:45.500 --> 43:47.043
you'd like to share with her.

43:48.169 --> 43:49.379
Who'd like to go first?

44:10.734 --> 44:11.985
Evening, mavis.

44:12.068 --> 44:14.654
I'm just stretching my legs.

44:14.738 --> 44:16.740
Likewise, I'm sure.

44:32.922 --> 44:34.257
Thank you, frazer.

44:35.467 --> 44:36.885
Frazer.

44:38.053 --> 44:39.220
George!

44:44.642 --> 44:46.227
Where are your glasses?

44:46.269 --> 44:47.312
Hello, dear.

44:48.438 --> 44:50.065
Just resting my eyes.

44:50.106 --> 44:52.275
Don't! It makes
you look piggy.

44:53.443 --> 44:54.486
Come along.

44:54.611 --> 44:56.279
Come on, Joe.
Darts night.

44:56.321 --> 44:58.281
-I don't play darts.
-You do now.

44:58.823 --> 44:59.991
Frank.

45:00.617 --> 45:01.826
<i>Lifeboat's</i> on in eastgate.

45:01.951 --> 45:03.745
Can't you see I'm busy?

45:07.207 --> 45:08.500
Frank, where's Arthur?

45:18.510 --> 45:20.470
Mavis.
What a...

45:20.512 --> 45:22.639
What a lovely surprise.

45:22.764 --> 45:23.932
New suit, Arthur?

45:24.307 --> 45:25.850
Uh, what?
No, no, no. It's...

45:25.975 --> 45:27.977
You can wear it for
what's left of your dinner.

45:29.979 --> 45:33.316
Elizabeth mainwaring, ats.
Officer, first class.

45:33.441 --> 45:35.985
Rose winters.
You do a marvelous job.

45:36.111 --> 45:38.196
I believe in fighting
for what's ours

45:38.321 --> 45:39.823
and crushing
the enemy underfoot.

45:39.948 --> 45:41.282
Don't you?

45:41.491 --> 45:44.160
I'll say good night,
Mrs. mainwaring.

45:45.120 --> 45:46.329
George.

45:54.629 --> 45:56.047
Night, frank.

45:57.173 --> 45:59.384
Time and tide, George.

46:02.012 --> 46:03.805
"Cottage,
4:00 P.M. please come."

46:04.347 --> 46:05.515
George!

46:06.474 --> 46:07.851
Coming, dear.

46:27.871 --> 46:30.707
-Hello, Joe.
-Oh. Strike a light!

46:31.249 --> 46:33.043
I thought you was old bill.

46:33.835 --> 46:36.004
Quite a hoard
you have here.

46:36.546 --> 46:38.840
I take it you don't
believe in rationing.

46:40.216 --> 46:42.427
Well, keep your head down
and earn a few Bob,

46:42.552 --> 46:44.512
that's what I believe in.

46:45.555 --> 46:48.725
Since they shut
off the army base, I've got a right backlog.

46:48.850 --> 46:50.185
I'm making up for lost time.

46:50.226 --> 46:52.562
Captain mainwaring
said you're not going near the base.

46:52.687 --> 46:54.898
Once I'm inside the compound,

46:54.939 --> 46:56.358
there'll be no stopping me.

46:58.360 --> 47:01.738
You know,
i should really report this.

47:07.744 --> 47:09.245
Come on, then.

47:11.081 --> 47:13.208
We all have our price,
miss winters.

47:14.250 --> 47:15.710
What's yours?

47:15.752 --> 47:18.755
Petrol? Navy cut?
Bootleg French perfume?

47:21.591 --> 47:22.759
Chanel no. 5?

47:22.884 --> 47:25.637
When you go to the base,
take me with you.

47:25.762 --> 47:27.639
You're not coming on the patrol.

47:27.889 --> 47:30.934
You're not the only one
who knows how to get what they want, Joe.

47:32.811 --> 47:35.605
Of course, this will be
quilted for extra comfort

47:35.647 --> 47:37.899
on your eternal slumber.

47:37.941 --> 47:40.235
Yes, I'd be quite happy
to decompose in this.

47:41.444 --> 47:43.571
We'll take two, Mr. frazer.

47:43.780 --> 47:46.157
I don't suppose
you would consider a discount.

47:46.282 --> 47:47.742
Well, to avail
yourself of that,

47:47.784 --> 47:50.578
you would both
have to pass on before the end of the month.

47:50.662 --> 47:54.124
Oh. We're not ready
to go quite yet, are we, cissy?

47:54.457 --> 47:56.459
Mother lived to 101.

47:56.960 --> 47:58.753
Miss winters, one moment!

47:58.795 --> 48:00.505
Miss winters.

48:01.965 --> 48:05.427
Cissy rang <i>the lady
</i> magazine in London

48:05.635 --> 48:09.431
to inquire about
your follow-up article.

48:09.639 --> 48:12.475
And they know
nothing about it, or you.

48:13.268 --> 48:14.811
You're on the run from the police.

48:14.936 --> 48:16.813
You killed a man
with your umbrella.

48:17.147 --> 48:18.982
Oh, I do apologize,
miss winters.

48:19.441 --> 48:22.485
She is cursed with
a romantic spirit.

48:22.527 --> 48:23.820
I know.

48:24.696 --> 48:26.531
You're a secret agent.

48:27.449 --> 48:28.783
A German spy

48:28.825 --> 48:31.161
sent here to discover
the invasion plans

48:31.202 --> 48:33.496
and bring
the allies to their knees.

48:34.164 --> 48:38.001
I'm afraid the truth
is far less colorful than that, ladies.

48:38.376 --> 48:40.128
I work for
the associated press.

48:40.503 --> 48:43.298
They place all their
articles uncredited.

48:43.548 --> 48:46.676
I hope that's cleared up
the confusion for you.

48:46.718 --> 48:48.011
Good day.

48:58.355 --> 49:00.315
Hello, captain. Welcome.

49:01.858 --> 49:03.151
I do like your hat.

49:03.234 --> 49:05.403
Oh. This old thing?

49:05.528 --> 49:07.489
-Please, come on in.
-Yeah.

49:08.698 --> 49:10.658
Sorry about the manner
of my invitation.

49:10.700 --> 49:12.535
No, no.

49:12.994 --> 49:15.538
No. Not at all.

49:17.165 --> 49:19.334
<i>I was hoping
you'd tell me more</i>

49:19.376 --> 49:22.420
about your unique
leadership style.

49:24.589 --> 49:25.715
Well,

49:26.049 --> 49:28.718
I'm not one to
blow my own trumpet,

49:29.219 --> 49:31.179
but I lead by example.

49:31.763 --> 49:35.392
There's nothing I would ask
my men to do that I would not do myself.

49:35.517 --> 49:36.559
Hmm.

49:37.227 --> 49:38.395
Cake?

49:39.020 --> 49:40.897
It's rather small, I'm afraid.

49:42.107 --> 49:43.358
We eat

49:44.567 --> 49:47.779
as a free people,
not under the Nazi heel.

49:48.405 --> 49:50.740
One thing my
men know for sure,

49:52.784 --> 49:55.954
the jackboot will not tread
upon this hallowed land

49:56.079 --> 49:57.539
while there is breath in this...

50:00.291 --> 50:01.376
Are you all right?

50:01.418 --> 50:02.794
Gone down the wrong way.

50:06.256 --> 50:08.591
You speak so
eloquently, captain.

50:08.717 --> 50:10.552
Have you never committed
your thoughts to paper?

50:10.593 --> 50:15.265
No, there's not enough
hours in the day, I'm afraid.

50:16.433 --> 50:19.894
Leadership is many things,
miss winters.

50:20.061 --> 50:22.272
Rose, I insist.

50:23.732 --> 50:26.943
Leadership is
many things, rose.

50:27.777 --> 50:30.405
But most of all,
it's about vision.

50:30.447 --> 50:31.489
Oh.

50:31.614 --> 50:33.074
Oh.

50:33.283 --> 50:37.620
-Cake on the floor. Cake on the...
-You're quite right, though.

50:37.746 --> 50:39.456
So sorry.

50:39.581 --> 50:44.127
Europe is crying out
for a man of vision, clarity,

50:44.169 --> 50:45.295
even ruthlessness.

50:45.420 --> 50:46.463
Quite.

50:46.588 --> 50:48.089
Get the trains
running on time.

50:48.131 --> 50:52.802
I believe you're destined to play
a huge part in this war, George.

50:53.636 --> 50:54.804
Really?

50:55.638 --> 50:57.098
I do hope so.

50:58.933 --> 51:01.144
I'm only sorry
i won't be able to write about it.

51:02.520 --> 51:03.646
But you must.

51:06.316 --> 51:07.525
What is the matter?

51:07.650 --> 51:09.110
It's my editor.

51:09.819 --> 51:13.656
He said if I don't write
about your patrol in my article,

51:14.366 --> 51:16.659
then he won't publish it.

51:18.119 --> 51:19.996
Come, now. Here.

51:23.375 --> 51:27.837
Maybe if your
editor insists upon it,

51:28.963 --> 51:30.298
then...

51:30.340 --> 51:31.633
What?

51:32.217 --> 51:34.803
Maybe you should...

51:34.844 --> 51:35.970
Rose?

51:37.347 --> 51:39.057
- Wilson.
- Hello?

51:39.182 --> 51:40.183
What's he doing here?

51:40.308 --> 51:41.559
I have no idea.

51:41.685 --> 51:43.561
- One moment.
- Hello?

51:44.187 --> 51:45.230
No, no.

51:45.689 --> 51:48.650
I'm not here.
I'm in eastbourne with my area manager.

51:49.192 --> 51:52.487
"A thing of beauty
is a joy forever.

51:52.529 --> 51:53.571
"Its loveliness increases..."

51:53.697 --> 51:55.240
Arthur, this is not the time.

51:55.365 --> 51:57.367
Sorry. I'll come back.

51:59.369 --> 52:00.745
No, I won't!

52:03.373 --> 52:04.916
I've been doing
that all my life,

52:05.041 --> 52:07.752
saying I'll come back
when I wanted to stay,

52:07.877 --> 52:10.046
staying when I wanted to go.

52:10.171 --> 52:11.715
Rose, that night
at the summer ball,

52:11.840 --> 52:16.219
I wanted to kiss
you very, very much.

52:16.261 --> 52:19.389
I should have
kissed you, like this.

52:24.602 --> 52:25.854
Sorry.

52:25.895 --> 52:28.398
I had feelings for you
then, rose. I still do.

52:28.440 --> 52:30.900
Perhaps I haven't been
everything I could have been,

52:30.942 --> 52:32.736
but perhaps
it's not too late.

52:32.861 --> 52:37.615
Perhaps I still could be,
with a little help from someone,

52:38.074 --> 52:39.701
someone like you.

52:39.743 --> 52:42.746
Rose, guess who!

52:43.246 --> 52:45.582
-Frank? What's he doing here?
-I have no idea.

52:45.623 --> 52:47.042
One moment.

52:49.794 --> 52:51.755
I've come to find you.

52:53.465 --> 52:55.550
"Here's looking at you, kid."

52:55.592 --> 52:57.594
Frank, you've been drinking.

52:57.635 --> 52:59.596
Mum's ginger wine.
It don't half make you squiffy.

53:01.264 --> 53:04.559
I got your note.
I can read between the lines.

53:05.143 --> 53:06.936
I know what
you're really saying.

53:07.896 --> 53:10.815
See, you're a woman
and I'm a man.

53:10.940 --> 53:12.317
With a drawn on moustache.

53:12.442 --> 53:13.610
I'm errol Flynn.

53:15.945 --> 53:17.614
- Kiss me.
- Frank!

53:17.947 --> 53:19.282
Mum?

53:19.324 --> 53:20.575
I know you're in there.

53:21.659 --> 53:24.496
-Frank?
-I got this licked, sugar.

53:24.621 --> 53:26.164
Can you hear me?

53:27.415 --> 53:28.667
Mum?

53:28.792 --> 53:30.794
You get
yourself out here, now.

53:30.919 --> 53:32.962
I've got an
announcement to make.

53:33.088 --> 53:34.464
Look at the state of you.

53:34.506 --> 53:37.008
Me and miss winters
are in love.

53:37.133 --> 53:38.468
Don't be ridiculous.

53:38.510 --> 53:39.761
Good afternoon, sir.

53:39.803 --> 53:40.970
Wilson.

53:41.471 --> 53:42.639
Out. Now.

53:43.139 --> 53:45.475
The window. Quickly.

53:51.981 --> 53:53.441
George. George.

53:53.483 --> 53:54.943
The patrol.

53:55.819 --> 53:56.986
Can I come?

53:58.613 --> 53:59.989
Yes, of course.

54:00.323 --> 54:01.658
There you...

54:06.287 --> 54:09.499
How dare you lead
my little boy astray.

54:10.125 --> 54:12.168
You stay away from him.

54:17.841 --> 54:19.509
From both of 'em.

54:26.516 --> 54:27.809
Wilson.

55:07.432 --> 55:08.725
Get in.

55:17.233 --> 55:18.777
Taking in the air,
mainwaring?

55:19.861 --> 55:21.905
Recceing an exercise
for the men, sir.

55:21.946 --> 55:23.406
Yes,
well, we're all busy.

55:23.907 --> 55:26.284
I've got a ten-footer
on the eighth for a half.

55:27.619 --> 55:28.912
-Cunningham.
-Meeks.

55:28.953 --> 55:32.415
From mi5. Captain,
we have a situation.

55:32.457 --> 55:36.461
We've picked up
an enemy radio signal sent from this area.

55:36.586 --> 55:38.797
To the abwehr in Berlin.

55:38.922 --> 55:43.385
An enemy spy is operating
somewhere near here.

55:43.468 --> 55:45.762
Codename cobra,
no less.

55:46.805 --> 55:49.808
He'll be after
information on the Dover base.

55:49.933 --> 55:52.602
Operation bodyguard
was set up a year ago

55:52.644 --> 55:55.105
to keep Hitler guessing
about the invasion.

55:55.230 --> 55:57.774
Decoys, deception,
that sort of thing.

55:58.608 --> 56:00.318
This could cost us
the war, captain.

56:00.443 --> 56:03.613
If you see anything in
the least suspicious,

56:04.656 --> 56:05.907
call us.

56:07.450 --> 56:08.785
We're counting on you.

56:08.827 --> 56:10.161
It could be
anyone, mainwaring.

56:15.458 --> 56:17.002
<i>Enemy radio signal...</i>

56:17.127 --> 56:20.505
<i>Enemy spy is operating
somewhere near here.</i>

56:20.630 --> 56:21.798
<i>It could be
anyone, mainwaring.</i>

56:21.923 --> 56:23.466
<i>Anyone.</i>

56:29.139 --> 56:30.807
She's old enough
to be your mother.

56:30.932 --> 56:33.435
Creeping around there,
declaring undying love.

56:33.476 --> 56:35.020
Honestly, frank,
what were you thinking?

56:35.145 --> 56:37.188
Who'd do a stupid,
brainless thing like that?

56:37.313 --> 56:38.356
Exactly. I mean...

56:38.481 --> 56:40.316
Not your uncle Arthur,
that's for sure.

56:48.616 --> 56:49.784
Frank.

56:57.709 --> 56:59.836
Are you just gonna
throw our life away?

57:03.673 --> 57:04.716
Frank.

57:04.841 --> 57:06.801
How have I upset you?

57:08.678 --> 57:09.679
Uh.

57:10.013 --> 57:12.515
I don't wanna lose you, frank.

57:13.892 --> 57:15.393
We're finished, Vera.

57:16.186 --> 57:19.981
"You and I don't
amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world."

57:21.149 --> 57:22.192
Bye.

57:23.693 --> 57:24.861
Bye.

57:28.031 --> 57:29.324
I must go.

57:30.408 --> 57:32.202
I may not be
educated like her.

57:34.162 --> 57:37.207
I may not be rich
like her, or beautiful.

57:37.665 --> 57:39.042
But god help me,
Arthur Wilson,

57:39.084 --> 57:41.336
I love you,
and I'm not giving you up without a fight.

57:41.378 --> 57:42.420
Oh...

57:50.011 --> 57:51.221
Night, uncle Arthur.

57:51.346 --> 57:52.597
Good night, son.

57:55.517 --> 57:57.352
How was Mr. gribbins?

57:59.187 --> 58:00.230
Hmm?

58:00.438 --> 58:02.273
He's your area manager.

58:02.399 --> 58:06.361
You met him today
in eastbourne, apparently.

58:06.903 --> 58:08.279
Oh, uh...

58:09.197 --> 58:11.241
Fine. Fine.

58:11.366 --> 58:13.284
I saw your trousers.

58:14.244 --> 58:16.246
Tried to bite you, did he?

58:19.290 --> 58:22.919
What's the matter?
Have you seen a ghost?

58:26.297 --> 58:27.424
Sorry, dear.

58:29.968 --> 58:31.636
Rather a long day.

58:58.413 --> 59:00.957
Evening, mainwaring.

59:01.082 --> 59:02.625
Evening.

59:13.261 --> 59:14.304
Put that light out.

59:14.429 --> 59:15.472
No.

59:36.117 --> 59:37.827
Captain mainwaring.

59:37.869 --> 59:41.039
Mrs. fox and I are
doing a Jigsaw puzzle, sir.

59:41.164 --> 59:43.500
Bit of sky fell
down the sofa.

59:43.541 --> 59:45.168
We need to talk.

59:45.293 --> 59:47.295
I'll say good night,
then.

59:48.797 --> 59:51.508
Unless you're going to
burst in on me later,

59:51.633 --> 59:55.053
and have your wicked way.

59:58.181 --> 59:59.516
Night, Mrs. fox.

01:00:01.142 --> 01:00:04.229
Jones, I want you to remain calm.

01:00:04.354 --> 01:00:06.981
What I have to tell you
is highly confidential.

01:00:07.982 --> 01:00:10.735
-What, a spy? A real one?
-Quiet, Jones.

01:00:11.152 --> 01:00:12.529
You're the only person I've told.

01:00:12.570 --> 01:00:14.322
How do you know, sir?

01:00:14.364 --> 01:00:16.533
I've had a visit from mi5.

01:00:16.658 --> 01:00:19.202
Mi5? Why are you telling me?

01:00:19.327 --> 01:00:21.663
You think it's me, don't you?
You think I'm the spy.

01:00:21.705 --> 01:00:23.039
You've come here
to arrest me.

01:00:23.081 --> 01:00:24.249
Of course not, Jones.

01:00:24.374 --> 01:00:25.834
Sit down.

01:00:27.669 --> 01:00:32.215
I've come here because
i intend to catch him.

01:00:32.674 --> 01:00:34.384
But things could get nasty,

01:00:34.509 --> 01:00:37.762
and you're the only
one of us who's ever actually, you know...

01:00:39.431 --> 01:00:41.391
-Thusly.
-Aye, sir.

01:00:41.516 --> 01:00:43.018
-Thusly.
-Quite.

01:00:43.685 --> 01:00:46.229
I may need you to
dispatch him, Jones.

01:00:47.439 --> 01:00:50.567
Sit tight for now.
I shall be in touch.

01:00:52.068 --> 01:00:53.445
Meantime,

01:00:55.363 --> 01:00:57.032
put an edge on that.

01:00:58.908 --> 01:01:00.076
Very good, sir.

01:01:06.041 --> 01:01:08.710
Don't panic, Jack.
Don't panic.

01:01:09.586 --> 01:01:10.962
It's easy.

01:01:17.719 --> 01:01:19.387
-Arthur.
-Rose.

01:01:21.431 --> 01:01:23.266
I apologize about earlier.

01:01:23.391 --> 01:01:24.726
Oh, no, don't.

01:01:25.977 --> 01:01:27.812
I have feelings for you, too.

01:01:29.647 --> 01:01:32.317
Seeing you again has
brought them all back.

01:01:35.111 --> 01:01:37.322
I'm leaving tomorrow
night after the patrol.

01:01:38.615 --> 01:01:40.075
I want you to come with me.

01:01:41.409 --> 01:01:42.911
Tomorrow night?

01:01:45.121 --> 01:01:47.290
Tomorrow night's bridge night.

01:01:47.791 --> 01:01:49.459
I need your answer.

01:01:53.672 --> 01:01:54.964
After the patrol.

01:02:09.521 --> 01:02:11.606
-Oh. Captain mainwaring.
-Morning, ladies.

01:02:11.648 --> 01:02:15.527
Captain mainwaring, we have
discovered something terribly exciting

01:02:15.652 --> 01:02:17.362
about miss winters.

01:02:17.487 --> 01:02:18.697
Straight out of <i>greenmantle.</i>

01:02:18.822 --> 01:02:20.824
I can't stop.
My country needs me.

01:02:20.949 --> 01:02:23.493
Well, please yourself,
Mr. mainwaring.

01:02:25.995 --> 01:02:27.372
Off to win the war, Napoleon?

01:02:27.497 --> 01:02:29.499
Just you wait, Hodges.

01:02:29.541 --> 01:02:32.168
Today is going to be
the pinnacle of my military career.

01:02:32.293 --> 01:02:35.338
Don't tell me, you're gonna
collect colonel theakes's laundry?

01:02:37.382 --> 01:02:39.009
-Wilson.
-Morning, sir.

01:02:39.884 --> 01:02:43.513
About yesterday,
we're both men of the world.

01:02:43.638 --> 01:02:44.723
Are we, sir?

01:02:44.848 --> 01:02:46.349
Well, yes.

01:02:46.391 --> 01:02:47.642
I suggest that we...

01:02:47.684 --> 01:02:48.852
Draw a veil.

01:02:49.728 --> 01:02:50.854
Precisely.

01:02:50.895 --> 01:02:51.980
Consider it drawn.

01:02:54.065 --> 01:02:56.693
Colonel, we're just
about to set off.

01:02:56.735 --> 01:02:59.863
<i>Mi5 have picked up
another signal from the spy.</i>

01:03:00.697 --> 01:03:02.699
They've narrowed down
his location, mainwaring.

01:03:03.199 --> 01:03:04.659
<i>He's in walmington.</i>

01:03:06.202 --> 01:03:08.204
Walmington? Good lord.

01:03:08.329 --> 01:03:10.874
They're putting a cordon
round the town to flush him out.

01:03:10.999 --> 01:03:12.667
I want your platoon
at their disposal

01:03:12.709 --> 01:03:13.835
<i>as soon as you've
finished patrol.</i>

01:03:13.877 --> 01:03:15.378
<i>You'd better let your men know.</i>

01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:16.588
Of course, colonel.

01:03:16.713 --> 01:03:18.548
<i>It's imperative that
he's caught, mainwaring.</i>

01:03:18.673 --> 01:03:21.426
The allies cross
into France in 48 hours.

01:03:26.431 --> 01:03:27.891
- A spy?
- In walmington?

01:03:28.016 --> 01:03:29.934
-I can feel it in my bones.
-Walmington?

01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:32.228
I'll catch him, sir.
What does he look like?

01:03:32.354 --> 01:03:33.563
We don't know, frank.

01:03:33.605 --> 01:03:35.065
That's rather
the point with spies.

01:03:36.024 --> 01:03:38.109
His target is
the army base at Dover.

01:03:39.736 --> 01:03:41.905
We need to keep
a close watch on those cliffs.

01:03:44.783 --> 01:03:46.368
I want to catch him.

01:03:47.744 --> 01:03:52.624
And make today
the proudest in our history.

01:04:15.814 --> 01:04:18.316
He's close by.
I can feel him.

01:04:19.484 --> 01:04:20.985
Uncle Arthur!

01:04:21.403 --> 01:04:22.737
Uncle Arthur!

01:04:23.279 --> 01:04:25.115
Do be quiet, frank.

01:04:26.741 --> 01:04:27.784
Ah.

01:04:27.826 --> 01:04:29.494
I can see something, sir.

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:31.788
- Where?
- Look.

01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:33.331
Don't panic,
Mr. Godfrey. Keep pointing.

01:04:33.456 --> 01:04:35.000
-I'll alert my commanding officer.
-What is it?

01:04:35.125 --> 01:04:36.960
It's over there.
Look. Can you see?

01:04:37.669 --> 01:04:39.462
What is it, Godfrey?

01:04:39.504 --> 01:04:43.675
It's a spy.
A spy over there. See? There.

01:04:44.676 --> 01:04:46.803
He's sending a signal.

01:04:46.845 --> 01:04:47.971
What?

01:04:48.013 --> 01:04:49.097
The spy.

01:04:50.974 --> 01:04:55.145
Yes. White.
White, brown. White, brown.

01:04:55.270 --> 01:04:58.314
White, brown. White, brown.
White, brown. White, brown.

01:04:58.356 --> 01:05:00.650
White, brown.
White... god.

01:05:01.985 --> 01:05:04.154
As you were, men.

01:05:05.488 --> 01:05:06.948
It's a rabbit.

01:05:07.615 --> 01:05:11.995
Sir. Sir, are you sure it's not
a tiny spy dressed as a rabbit?

01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:14.330
These Nazi spies
are a devious lot, sir.

01:05:14.372 --> 01:05:17.000
What a fanciful notion, Jones.

01:05:19.294 --> 01:05:20.795
This weighs a ton.

01:05:21.296 --> 01:05:23.381
The base is
just over the rise.

01:05:24.299 --> 01:05:26.009
Carry this for me,
would you, jonesy?

01:05:26.134 --> 01:05:27.177
Righto.

01:05:27.218 --> 01:05:29.346
I'm just gonna
take some samples over.

01:05:29.846 --> 01:05:31.389
Here you go.

01:05:33.892 --> 01:05:35.560
It's now or never.

01:05:37.145 --> 01:05:38.355
It ain't half
heavy, Mr. Jones.

01:05:38.396 --> 01:05:39.898
No, light as a feather.

01:05:41.316 --> 01:05:42.567
Are you all right,
Mr. Jones?

01:05:42.692 --> 01:05:44.152
Yeah, yeah, I'll be fine.

01:05:44.569 --> 01:05:46.321
-Come on, rose.
-Thank you.

01:05:52.494 --> 01:05:53.703
Blimey.

01:05:54.579 --> 01:05:56.081
They've been busy.

01:06:01.878 --> 01:06:03.505
What are you doing?

01:06:04.214 --> 01:06:06.257
Well, a girl has
to look her best.

01:06:13.556 --> 01:06:15.517
Look,
Mr. Jones, a kittiwake.

01:06:16.226 --> 01:06:17.435
Whoa, whoa.

01:06:17.686 --> 01:06:19.229
All right, Mr. Jones.

01:06:19.688 --> 01:06:22.524
Don't you worry about me,
Mr. Godfrey.

01:06:23.066 --> 01:06:25.276
I'm strong as an ox
and twice as hairy.

01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:29.406
If I see the spy,
I'm going to throw pepper in his eyes.

01:06:29.447 --> 01:06:30.573
Whoa...

01:06:30.615 --> 01:06:33.910
I might have to ask him
to stand downwind of me, mind you, but...

01:06:35.245 --> 01:06:36.413
Mr. Jones?

01:06:36.538 --> 01:06:37.789
Mr. Jones?

01:06:38.248 --> 01:06:39.457
Mr. Jones?

01:06:41.251 --> 01:06:44.295
Captain mainwaring!
Mr. Jones has gone over!

01:06:46.089 --> 01:06:47.090
Oh, no.

01:06:55.432 --> 01:06:57.100
He can't be.

01:06:57.892 --> 01:07:00.061
To the beach, men,
at the double.

01:07:01.229 --> 01:07:02.272
Captain!

01:07:02.397 --> 01:07:03.773
Jones?

01:07:06.609 --> 01:07:08.111
- Jones!
- He's alive.

01:07:08.236 --> 01:07:09.571
- Thank heavens.
- Hold on tight.

01:07:09.612 --> 01:07:10.947
Don't panic.

01:07:11.614 --> 01:07:14.617
I am panicking, sir.
I can't help it.

01:07:14.743 --> 01:07:16.911
Rope. We need rope, men.

01:07:16.953 --> 01:07:18.079
Where's Walker?

01:07:18.121 --> 01:07:19.622
He's gone to
the base to get help.

01:07:19.664 --> 01:07:21.291
-Well, fetch him, pike.
-Yeah.

01:07:21.416 --> 01:07:22.459
Hold on, Jones.

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:23.835
Jones.

01:07:24.502 --> 01:07:27.630
Joe! Joe,
Mr. Jones has gone over. We need rope.

01:07:28.631 --> 01:07:30.258
Hold on tight! We're coming.

01:07:31.009 --> 01:07:33.762
Can you come
fairly quickly, sir?

01:07:33.803 --> 01:07:36.806
Terrible. I never
got his measurements.

01:07:38.308 --> 01:07:39.351
Yeah, that'll do.

01:07:40.101 --> 01:07:41.144
Come on.

01:07:49.152 --> 01:07:51.613
Tie it off, Jones!
Tie it off.

01:07:51.654 --> 01:07:55.283
Yeah, yeah, it's tied off.
Chain's tied off, yeah.

01:07:55.325 --> 01:07:57.535
- Hold on tight, jonesy.
- Pull him up, men.

01:07:57.660 --> 01:07:59.996
- One, two, three.
- Jonesy, you're safe as houses.

01:08:00.038 --> 01:08:02.624
- Pull!
- Hold on, Jones!

01:08:03.708 --> 01:08:04.793
You okay?

01:08:08.546 --> 01:08:09.631
Hold on, Jones!

01:08:09.673 --> 01:08:13.009
I'm rotating, sir.
I'm rotating.

01:08:13.134 --> 01:08:14.177
- Give me your hand, Jones!
- That's it.

01:08:14.219 --> 01:08:16.638
- Pull!
- Pull! Pull, men!

01:08:19.515 --> 01:08:21.309
- Jones, pull.
- That's it, well done.

01:08:21.350 --> 01:08:23.060
- Grab his arse.
- Well done.

01:08:26.022 --> 01:08:28.858
Thank you, sir.
I thought I was a goner.

01:08:29.859 --> 01:08:32.696
My whole life
flashed before my eyes.

01:08:33.863 --> 01:08:35.865
At least I think it was my life.

01:08:36.908 --> 01:08:40.328
Right, let's get this chain
back to the base.

01:08:40.370 --> 01:08:41.830
You gave me
a real fright, Mr. Jones.

01:08:41.871 --> 01:08:43.707
Right, up you come,
jonesy.

01:08:48.877 --> 01:08:51.756
There's a sight
for sore eyes, Walker?

01:08:52.674 --> 01:08:55.010
Makes you proud to be British.

01:09:00.223 --> 01:09:01.599
Stone the crows.

01:09:02.725 --> 01:09:04.894
Here, the whole place is a fake!

01:09:38.970 --> 01:09:40.971
Miss winters.

01:09:45.143 --> 01:09:46.435
Vera.

01:09:47.312 --> 01:09:49.229
What brings you out here?

01:09:49.272 --> 01:09:51.274
I saw you
out on the sands.

01:09:54.109 --> 01:09:55.278
It's frank.

01:09:55.945 --> 01:09:59.783
I know he's a silly boy,
but he'll make a fine man one day.

01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:04.162
I love him, miss winters.

01:10:05.747 --> 01:10:08.291
Trouble is, he loves you.

01:10:09.334 --> 01:10:12.337
Just a little crush, perhaps.
Nothing to worry about.

01:10:13.797 --> 01:10:15.632
Besides, I leave tonight.

01:10:15.965 --> 01:10:16.966
Oh.

01:10:18.593 --> 01:10:19.636
Oh.

01:10:20.595 --> 01:10:22.097
Where are you off to next?

01:10:22.138 --> 01:10:24.307
Paris? New York?

01:10:24.933 --> 01:10:27.143
You life's so glamorous
compared to mine.

01:10:31.272 --> 01:10:33.650
What's that?
You hear that?

01:10:41.199 --> 01:10:42.826
Stay where you are.

01:10:57.549 --> 01:10:59.884
I'm going home to Berlin.

01:11:05.348 --> 01:11:08.852
It's a complete and utter balls-up.

01:11:08.977 --> 01:11:12.897
Operation bodyguard took yonks
to put into place and you...

01:11:13.023 --> 01:11:16.651
You have destroyed it
in seconds, you imbecile.

01:11:17.694 --> 01:11:21.197
The entire invasion plan will have to
be put back now because of you

01:11:21.322 --> 01:11:23.199
until, I don't know, June.

01:11:23.742 --> 01:11:26.202
And I'm meant to be
going sailing in June.

01:11:27.037 --> 01:11:31.541
My men have now
secured all but one of the tanks, brigadier.

01:11:32.334 --> 01:11:37.255
It is quite possible
that the spy saw absolutely nothing.

01:11:42.677 --> 01:11:45.055
Captain mainwaring!
Captain mainwaring!

01:11:50.226 --> 01:11:54.022
Oh, yes, Napoleon.
This is the pinnacle of your career, all right.

01:12:00.403 --> 01:12:02.739
You are stripped
of your rank with immediate effect.

01:12:03.615 --> 01:12:06.242
Wilson, you have the command.

01:12:07.911 --> 01:12:09.037
Oxford man, sir.

01:12:09.079 --> 01:12:10.205
Good show.

01:12:11.247 --> 01:12:15.418
The future of this
platoon is under review.

01:12:15.794 --> 01:12:17.754
-Brigadier.
-Dismissed.

01:12:21.925 --> 01:12:25.637
I'm sorry, sir.
It's all my fault,

01:12:25.762 --> 01:12:27.639
falling off the cliff like that.

01:12:29.099 --> 01:12:30.433
No, Jones.

01:12:34.437 --> 01:12:35.438
Men,

01:12:37.607 --> 01:12:39.609
it's been a privilege.

01:12:47.117 --> 01:12:48.451
Upsy-Daisy.

01:12:49.452 --> 01:12:52.455
Arthur, I need your answer.

01:12:56.668 --> 01:12:58.461
I'm not coming, rose.

01:13:00.505 --> 01:13:01.965
It's a dream

01:13:02.632 --> 01:13:04.300
of another life.

01:13:04.426 --> 01:13:05.635
Didn't you hear him?

01:13:05.677 --> 01:13:08.638
That mi5 are gonna question us
all, first thing they get here.

01:13:08.763 --> 01:13:09.806
But I don't know nothing.

01:13:09.848 --> 01:13:12.017
They'll use
the thumbscrews.

01:13:12.642 --> 01:13:14.477
My train leaves in an hour.

01:13:15.645 --> 01:13:17.480
Will you come
and see me off?

01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:20.358
For old times' sake?

01:13:20.483 --> 01:13:21.818
Of course.

01:13:34.998 --> 01:13:36.541
That's decided then.

01:13:36.833 --> 01:13:39.336
Thank you, vicar.
Goodbye.

01:13:41.838 --> 01:13:44.132
George, I thought
you were on patrol.

01:13:44.674 --> 01:13:46.426
So, it's been agreed.

01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:48.678
The choir will form
the head of the parade

01:13:48.762 --> 01:13:50.597
while the platoon
brings up the rear.

01:13:51.181 --> 01:13:52.349
Whatever you say, dear.

01:13:52.432 --> 01:13:55.101
There's no point
arguing about it.

01:13:55.852 --> 01:13:58.229
George, you're white as a sheet.

01:13:59.189 --> 01:14:01.024
I shan't be on parade.

01:14:01.858 --> 01:14:04.194
I'm no longer
a serving officer in the home guard.

01:14:04.277 --> 01:14:05.528
I've been let go.

01:14:05.612 --> 01:14:07.280
I beg your pardon?

01:14:11.034 --> 01:14:14.412
They're thinking of disbanding
the platoon 'cause of me.

01:14:18.625 --> 01:14:21.711
All I ever wanted
in this war was to do my bit.

01:14:40.313 --> 01:14:42.399
Mainwaring residence.

01:14:49.114 --> 01:14:51.658
Two nights ago,
he invited me for a drink

01:14:51.741 --> 01:14:53.076
to talk about old times.

01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:56.955
It was so awkward.
He tried to kiss me.

01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:58.957
Oh, the cad.

01:14:59.082 --> 01:15:01.918
So I came in here
and I heard a sound,

01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:05.755
like static or
a transmitter or something.

01:15:06.423 --> 01:15:10.427
He told me it was
his wireless, but...

01:15:10.510 --> 01:15:12.095
Good lord.

01:15:27.318 --> 01:15:29.029
Captain pigeon ring!

01:15:29.112 --> 01:15:32.032
The incriminalizing evidentials!

01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:38.830
Some sort of code.

01:15:54.804 --> 01:15:56.806
What sort of
language is that?

01:15:57.807 --> 01:15:59.309
German, perhaps.

01:16:01.644 --> 01:16:03.146
Captain, look.

01:16:04.898 --> 01:16:05.982
Oh, no.

01:16:08.651 --> 01:16:10.320
1:24.

01:16:13.198 --> 01:16:14.532
Still time.

01:16:15.867 --> 01:16:17.243
Jones.

01:16:27.253 --> 01:16:30.674
Sir, I want to tell you
something in complete continence.

01:16:30.715 --> 01:16:32.217
I've never killed a man.

01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:34.886
What?

01:16:35.011 --> 01:16:37.389
Fine time to tell me, Jones.

01:16:37.514 --> 01:16:39.349
All those stories
about the Sudan?

01:16:39.432 --> 01:16:43.269
Well, I was there
all right, sir. Army catering corps.

01:16:43.353 --> 01:16:45.689
When I come back,
i sort of emblemished the truth.

01:16:45.772 --> 01:16:49.359
Who wants to know
he went all the way to the Sudan to make tea?

01:16:50.110 --> 01:16:52.529
Well, you know what they say.

01:16:59.369 --> 01:17:02.706
"Cometh the hour,
cometh the man."

01:17:14.801 --> 01:17:17.470
<i>Guten</i> evening,
<i>herr</i> Wilson. <i>Handies hoch.</i>

01:17:17.554 --> 01:17:19.222
I beg your pardon?

01:17:21.141 --> 01:17:23.560
About to abscond, are we?

01:17:23.643 --> 01:17:25.228
Sir, I'm not a spy.

01:17:25.895 --> 01:17:27.105
Well, I shouldn't be surprised.

01:17:29.065 --> 01:17:32.402
Your class has always
had a talent for treachery.

01:17:33.737 --> 01:17:36.781
This war will sweep
your kind away, Wilson,

01:17:36.906 --> 01:17:39.743
and I for one will not
mourn its passing.

01:17:41.077 --> 01:17:42.829
You turn my stomach.

01:17:43.913 --> 01:17:45.498
Coward!

01:17:50.670 --> 01:17:53.131
I don't know
what I'll do if they disband us.

01:17:53.256 --> 01:17:56.593
My sisters like to play
canasta in the evenings.

01:17:56.676 --> 01:17:58.762
I find it all
rather complicated.

01:17:58.803 --> 01:18:00.347
I'm joining the ats.

01:18:00.972 --> 01:18:02.432
Darn sight prettier than you lot.

01:18:03.808 --> 01:18:06.019
Well, look who's here.

01:18:06.436 --> 01:18:08.104
Men who lost us the war.

01:18:08.188 --> 01:18:10.607
That's most unkind, Mr. Hodges.

01:18:10.648 --> 01:18:13.276
Who needs the enemy
when we've got the home guard?

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:15.612
You're a shambles,
the lot of you.

01:18:15.862 --> 01:18:17.447
How dare you say that?

01:18:18.031 --> 01:18:20.617
Mr. frazer and Mr. Jones
fought in the first war.

01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:22.535
Mr. Godfrey was
a stretcher bearer.

01:18:22.619 --> 01:18:24.037
You're not fit to lick their boots.

01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:25.455
And you wanna watch
your lip, sunshine.

01:18:25.538 --> 01:18:27.123
All you do
is whistle at people.

01:18:27.165 --> 01:18:28.708
"Put that light out!
Put that light out!"

01:18:28.792 --> 01:18:30.627
Shut your mouth,
you little mummy's boy.

01:18:30.710 --> 01:18:32.379
I'll have your guts for garters.

01:18:32.671 --> 01:18:33.713
Behave yourself.

01:18:33.797 --> 01:18:35.632
I have grave news, men.

01:18:36.007 --> 01:18:37.634
Grave news indeed.

01:18:37.676 --> 01:18:39.135
Well, look who it is.

01:18:39.219 --> 01:18:41.304
The failure-in-chief.

01:18:44.974 --> 01:18:48.520
Evidence has been found
indicating sergeant Wilson is the spy.

01:18:48.645 --> 01:18:51.314
Sergeant Wilson?
No, he's not good-looking enough.

01:18:51.398 --> 01:18:54.150
He can't be the spy.
He'd have told us.

01:18:54.192 --> 01:18:56.486
It's over, mainwaring.
Go home, man.

01:18:56.528 --> 01:18:57.904
You've been stripped
of your command,

01:18:57.987 --> 01:18:59.739
stripped naked
in the eyes of the world,

01:18:59.823 --> 01:19:01.491
and it's a terrible sight.

01:19:01.574 --> 01:19:04.077
Corporal Jones and I have
discovered a crystal radio set

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:05.995
hidden under his desk

01:19:06.037 --> 01:19:09.708
and top-secret documents
written in German.

01:19:09.833 --> 01:19:11.209
-No way.
-God, German.

01:19:19.259 --> 01:19:23.179
I've locked him
into the church hall until mi5 arrive.

01:19:23.221 --> 01:19:24.848
I'm telling mum.

01:19:25.598 --> 01:19:28.852
In the meantime, I shall be
reassuming command of the platoon.

01:19:28.935 --> 01:19:32.188
I knew it, captain.
I never liked Wilson, anyway.

01:19:33.106 --> 01:19:37.777
Well, I take no pleasure in this,
frazer, but a spy is a spy.

01:19:38.111 --> 01:19:39.779
Oh, you've solved it,
have you?

01:19:39.904 --> 01:19:44.034
Oh, we had our suspicions
from the start, didn't we, cissy?

01:19:44.117 --> 01:19:46.202
We just couldn't
put our finger on it.

01:19:46.244 --> 01:19:49.039
Turns out it was
staring us in the face.

01:19:49.789 --> 01:19:53.084
Miss winters is a foreign agent.

01:19:53.209 --> 01:19:56.296
Miss winters, a spy?
She can't be. She's a woman.

01:19:58.590 --> 01:20:01.301
I shall go and break the news
to her at Sully point.

01:20:01.384 --> 01:20:02.594
I'm coming with you.

01:20:03.595 --> 01:20:07.223
Good of you, Walker,
but I think I should go alone.

01:20:07.265 --> 01:20:09.100
Meet me at the
church hall in an hour,

01:20:09.225 --> 01:20:11.811
and we shall discuss
a guard rota for the traitor Wilson.

01:20:12.437 --> 01:20:17.067
Dolly dear, what did you mean it
was staring you in the face?

01:20:17.108 --> 01:20:19.402
Miss winters' clothes, of course.

01:20:19.444 --> 01:20:21.988
That Chanel dress in particular.

01:20:22.072 --> 01:20:25.450
So, we phoned
the fashion house in Paris

01:20:25.575 --> 01:20:27.660
to ask if anyone there knew her.

01:20:27.744 --> 01:20:30.747
A very nice young man
in records confirmed

01:20:30.789 --> 01:20:34.417
that she bought regularly
from their collections,

01:20:34.501 --> 01:20:38.588
and they sent them
directly to her home.

01:20:39.422 --> 01:20:42.258
That was the missing
piece of the Jigsaw, wasn't it, cissy?

01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:43.593
But what was it?

01:20:43.843 --> 01:20:46.096
Ooh. The address,
silly Billy.

01:20:46.179 --> 01:20:48.765
Miss winters lives in Berlin.

01:20:49.099 --> 01:20:50.308
Berlin.

01:20:52.936 --> 01:20:54.646
Well, come on, look lively.

01:20:55.689 --> 01:20:56.773
Godfrey, let's go.

01:20:56.815 --> 01:20:57.857
Berlin.

01:20:58.191 --> 01:21:00.443
Berlin, yeah. Lovely.

01:21:00.485 --> 01:21:02.362
Why were you there, Arthur?

01:21:03.697 --> 01:21:06.157
Were you really leaving me

01:21:06.282 --> 01:21:07.450
and frank?

01:21:10.370 --> 01:21:12.789
I've been standing
at a crossroads, mavis.

01:21:13.957 --> 01:21:16.334
Staring down a road I never took.

01:21:18.878 --> 01:21:22.632
I wasn't leaving you.
I went to say goodbye to her.

01:21:25.051 --> 01:21:29.472
My life is here
with you, dearest,

01:21:29.931 --> 01:21:31.474
and with frank.

01:21:31.599 --> 01:21:33.143
I know that now.

01:21:35.645 --> 01:21:37.022
Release him, jonesy.

01:21:37.981 --> 01:21:41.484
I've always said it,
the man's as innocent as a newborn babe.

01:21:41.526 --> 01:21:43.153
He's a Nazi spy.

01:21:43.194 --> 01:21:46.156
We caught him at the station
about to abscons.

01:21:46.281 --> 01:21:48.283
Abscond, jonesy.

01:21:48.658 --> 01:21:50.994
Rose winters asked me
to see her off.

01:21:51.036 --> 01:21:55.957
She's the spy or my name's
not James Donald nathrachean frazer.

01:21:55.999 --> 01:21:59.711
Yes, you see,
my sisters found out, she lives in Berlin.

01:22:01.004 --> 01:22:02.547
They're frightfully clever,
those two.

01:22:02.672 --> 01:22:04.841
Later, if you wouldn't mind,
Mr. Godfrey.

01:22:04.883 --> 01:22:06.176
Yes.

01:22:06.968 --> 01:22:08.970
-Jones, untie me.
-Give it here, Jack.

01:22:12.557 --> 01:22:14.851
No hard feelings,
i hope, sergeant?

01:22:14.893 --> 01:22:17.812
Even when you
was a Nazi pig dog,

01:22:17.854 --> 01:22:20.023
I still felt warmly towards you.

01:22:38.708 --> 01:22:42.420
Uncle Arthur, the coast guard just
spotted a u-boat off Sully point.

01:22:42.545 --> 01:22:45.382
Real Germans.
Permission to panic, sergeant.

01:22:45.423 --> 01:22:47.092
Permission denied.
It'll be her escape route.

01:22:47.217 --> 01:22:48.218
Where's mainwaring?

01:22:48.343 --> 01:22:49.886
Blimey. I forgot.

01:22:50.011 --> 01:22:51.054
He's gone after her.

01:22:51.096 --> 01:22:52.222
He's in danger.
Jones, the rifles.

01:22:52.347 --> 01:22:53.598
Very good, sir.

01:22:53.723 --> 01:22:56.351
We can't just go
storming down there mob-handed.

01:22:56.393 --> 01:22:57.435
They'll see us
coming a mile off.

01:22:57.560 --> 01:22:58.603
Not if we go in camouflage.

01:22:58.728 --> 01:23:01.731
We'd give a lovely
marran grass effect with all this hay.

01:23:01.856 --> 01:23:03.358
Excellent! Men, the hay.

01:23:03.942 --> 01:23:06.695
No, Arthur. I won't let you.

01:23:06.736 --> 01:23:08.446
I have no choice.

01:23:10.407 --> 01:23:11.950
Stop messing about.

01:23:12.075 --> 01:23:13.576
At the double, Mr. Godfrey.

01:23:15.036 --> 01:23:16.705
If you'd be so kind.

01:23:19.749 --> 01:23:21.251
Miss winters.

01:23:23.086 --> 01:23:24.546
Miss winters.

01:23:28.383 --> 01:23:30.051
We've caught him.

01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:32.554
Wilson, I mean.

01:23:36.474 --> 01:23:37.934
Huge shock, I know.

01:23:39.436 --> 01:23:43.064
Who knows
what lurks in the hearts of men, etcetera?

01:23:46.276 --> 01:23:49.070
I'm here if you need me.

01:23:50.947 --> 01:23:52.782
A shoulder to cry on.

01:23:58.288 --> 01:24:00.915
Good lord.
U-boat. U-boat!

01:24:02.459 --> 01:24:05.420
You will play a big role
in this war, mainwaring,

01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:08.089
as the fool who
lost england the war.

01:24:11.426 --> 01:24:13.136
Churchill?

01:24:27.442 --> 01:24:29.486
They don't like it up 'em.

01:24:33.782 --> 01:24:35.950
Mrs. pike,
what's the matter?

01:24:36.326 --> 01:24:37.827
Miss winters is a spy.

01:24:39.329 --> 01:24:42.540
The men have gone to
Sully point after her, and there's a u-boat!

01:24:42.665 --> 01:24:44.000
They've got no backup.

01:24:44.959 --> 01:24:49.214
Daphne, would you be kind enough to
rustle us up some hardware?

01:24:52.801 --> 01:24:54.344
Thanks to you, George,

01:24:54.386 --> 01:24:58.390
they'll be waiting in normandy to
drive the allies back into the sea.

01:24:58.515 --> 01:24:59.683
Help!

01:25:00.517 --> 01:25:01.851
Help!

01:25:02.477 --> 01:25:03.728
Help!

01:25:04.145 --> 01:25:05.188
Vera.

01:25:05.313 --> 01:25:06.690
Help!

01:25:06.815 --> 01:25:08.066
Have you no heart?

01:25:08.191 --> 01:25:12.529
I burn with passion
to see my <i>fuhrer</i> walk up whitehall.

01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:21.371
We will never surrender.

01:25:26.334 --> 01:25:27.836
Coming, Vera!

01:25:30.672 --> 01:25:32.007
Vera!

01:25:36.177 --> 01:25:37.387
Cometh the hour.

01:25:37.512 --> 01:25:38.722
Well done, jonesy.

01:25:41.516 --> 01:25:45.020
Next time,
i won't be so kind-hearted!

01:25:48.398 --> 01:25:49.566
Take cover, men!

01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:53.153
Run, captain!
Come on.

01:25:54.654 --> 01:25:55.697
Oh, sir.

01:25:57.032 --> 01:25:58.199
Wilson.

01:25:59.409 --> 01:26:01.911
Your command, sir.
Welcome back.

01:26:02.871 --> 01:26:05.415
Thank you, Wilson. Men!

01:26:07.042 --> 01:26:09.210
We must prevent miss winters
from escaping.

01:26:11.087 --> 01:26:15.383
But first, we must rescue
Vera shilton from the incoming tide.

01:26:17.761 --> 01:26:21.598
"It's a far better thing I do now
than I have ever done."

01:26:21.681 --> 01:26:23.767
Don't be silly, frank.

01:26:23.933 --> 01:26:25.435
Please don't!

01:26:25.518 --> 01:26:27.228
Ronald colman,
<i>a tale of two cities.</i>

01:26:27.270 --> 01:26:30.273
I saw that.
Basil rathbone was frightfully good in that.

01:26:31.441 --> 01:26:33.360
- I'm coming, Vera!
- Frank, no!

01:26:33.443 --> 01:26:34.611
Pike, get back here!

01:26:34.736 --> 01:26:35.904
He'll never make it.

01:26:36.446 --> 01:26:37.614
He's got flat feet.

01:26:39.366 --> 01:26:40.408
I'm going after him.

01:26:40.450 --> 01:26:41.868
No, you'll be cut to pieces.

01:26:43.411 --> 01:26:44.454
I must.

01:26:45.038 --> 01:26:46.081
We shall create a diversion.

01:26:46.122 --> 01:26:47.582
Let me try something.

01:26:55.882 --> 01:26:57.801
What did you say,
Mr. Godfrey?

01:26:58.301 --> 01:27:01.763
I said, "where is my
good-night snuggle, sweetheart?"

01:27:06.893 --> 01:27:08.061
Frank!

01:27:09.562 --> 01:27:12.982
Uncle Arthur, I'm scared.

01:27:13.066 --> 01:27:15.819
Frank, it's not Betty grable.

01:27:15.944 --> 01:27:19.739
It's not Rita...
What's the one with the red hair?

01:27:19.823 --> 01:27:21.574
-Hayworth.
-That's the one.

01:27:21.658 --> 01:27:22.992
It's Vera.

01:27:23.076 --> 01:27:26.287
Your real, live Vera.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.084
Frank!

01:27:36.297 --> 01:27:37.507
Need another diversion.

01:27:37.632 --> 01:27:41.094
I'll give them something that'll
put the fear of god into them.

01:27:43.763 --> 01:27:44.848
Hey!

01:27:52.188 --> 01:27:53.273
Run!

01:27:54.357 --> 01:27:55.358
Vera!

01:28:00.780 --> 01:28:02.198
Frank.

01:28:02.615 --> 01:28:03.700
Excellent, frazer.

01:28:03.825 --> 01:28:05.201
I haven't finished yet, sir.

01:28:05.285 --> 01:28:06.369
Quite enough, thank you.

01:28:08.705 --> 01:28:10.540
Sod this for
a game of soldiers.

01:28:11.291 --> 01:28:13.043
Walker. Walker!

01:28:13.126 --> 01:28:15.712
Walker, return to
your position at once!

01:28:18.548 --> 01:28:20.884
You're a
yellow-bellied deserter!

01:28:28.391 --> 01:28:32.395
We're doomed. Doomed!

01:28:33.646 --> 01:28:35.023
Men...

01:28:36.733 --> 01:28:39.027
I am a man of few words, but...

01:28:41.488 --> 01:28:42.906
There comes a time
in a soldier's life,

01:28:43.031 --> 01:28:44.824
when one must confront...

01:28:44.908 --> 01:28:48.870
For god's sake, man, we're in enough
trouble without you making a speech.

01:28:55.418 --> 01:28:57.087
It's changing direction!

01:29:00.173 --> 01:29:01.424
Look.

01:29:01.758 --> 01:29:03.051
It can't be.

01:29:06.304 --> 01:29:08.264
On my command, ladies.

01:29:10.308 --> 01:29:11.434
Fire!

01:29:13.436 --> 01:29:14.479
Ah!

01:29:28.243 --> 01:29:29.452
She's getting away!

01:29:33.164 --> 01:29:35.333
Captain, no!

01:29:48.638 --> 01:29:52.183
Joseph Walker,
you must be crazy.

01:30:10.285 --> 01:30:13.163
<i>Looks like you split your lederhosen</i>

01:30:17.250 --> 01:30:21.171
<i>auf wiedersehen to you!</i>

01:30:27.510 --> 01:30:28.636
Joe.

01:30:41.483 --> 01:30:43.443
Well, I'll be damned.

01:30:43.526 --> 01:30:45.570
Meeks, alert the Navy.

01:30:45.653 --> 01:30:47.947
That u-boat does
not leave the bay.

01:30:48.031 --> 01:30:49.407
Very good, sir.

01:30:51.451 --> 01:30:53.286
I fear
we may be too late.

01:31:03.463 --> 01:31:04.714
Oh, my...

01:31:05.382 --> 01:31:07.133
He was a great captain.

01:31:11.137 --> 01:31:12.305
The best.

01:31:13.139 --> 01:31:14.182
Oh.

01:31:20.522 --> 01:31:21.690
Look.

01:31:24.484 --> 01:31:26.736
And the sea delivereth him.

01:31:57.392 --> 01:31:59.436
Yours, I believe, gentlemen.

01:32:09.946 --> 01:32:11.740
They've sealed off the bay.

01:32:14.659 --> 01:32:16.244
Good show, mainwaring.

01:32:26.629 --> 01:32:28.423
Joe. Joe.

01:32:29.132 --> 01:32:30.258
You're my hero.

01:32:30.342 --> 01:32:31.426
Oh, leave it out, daph.

01:32:32.635 --> 01:32:34.262
Come on, then.

01:32:34.346 --> 01:32:37.098
Mr. Jones, I'm in awe.

01:32:37.807 --> 01:32:39.809
How can I possibly
thank you?

01:32:39.893 --> 01:32:41.811
You'll think of something.

01:32:42.062 --> 01:32:45.482
I already have.
Let's finish that puzzle, shall we?

01:32:46.816 --> 01:32:50.236
Oh, Arthur, you saved him,
our little boy.

01:32:50.945 --> 01:32:53.073
Well, he's a man now, mavis.

01:32:57.911 --> 01:32:59.579
Good god.

01:33:00.163 --> 01:33:01.623
Mavis, look away.

01:33:03.124 --> 01:33:05.502
Shouldn't do that
in front of people.

01:33:09.464 --> 01:33:12.884
So, Jerry met his match.

01:33:15.679 --> 01:33:17.389
Excellent work, captain.

01:33:19.808 --> 01:33:21.601
We couldn't have done it
without you, officer.

01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:28.358
-Elizabeth...
-Enough tosh, George.

01:33:29.401 --> 01:33:31.486
You have a parade to lead.

01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:08.314
Had my suspicions
about miss winters from the start.

01:34:09.274 --> 01:34:11.109
I couldn't tell anyone,
of course.

01:34:11.192 --> 01:34:13.319
Price of leadership.

01:34:15.780 --> 01:34:18.408
Not bad for a shambles,
Mr. Hodges?

01:34:22.245 --> 01:34:24.873
Bravo, mainwaring.
I never doubted you.

01:34:27.542 --> 01:34:30.420
Touch and go for a while,
old friend, but we got there in the end.

01:34:32.464 --> 01:34:33.882
Friend, sir?

01:34:34.924 --> 01:34:36.676
Eyes front, shoulders back.

01:34:37.302 --> 01:34:39.763
Sergeant in the home guard,
not a sack of potatoes.

01:34:39.846 --> 01:34:42.766
Thank you, sir.
You really are most awfully kind.

01:37:36.606 --> 01:37:38.942
Attention!

01:37:41.611 --> 01:37:43.530
Where is sergeant Wilson?

01:37:43.613 --> 01:37:45.949
In bed, I shouldn't wonder.
Caught a chill up on the downs.

01:37:46.032 --> 01:37:47.117
Poppycock.

01:37:47.158 --> 01:37:48.368
Saw him coming
out of the...

01:37:48.451 --> 01:37:49.536
Whose phone is that?

01:37:49.619 --> 01:37:50.704
Sorry, sir. Mine.

01:37:50.787 --> 01:37:52.455
Godfrey,
take that phone out!

01:37:52.539 --> 01:37:53.665
-Sorry, sir.
-Turn it off immediately!

01:37:53.790 --> 01:37:55.458
Sorry, sir. Sorry.

01:37:55.542 --> 01:37:56.626
Take it out!

01:37:56.668 --> 01:37:58.044
I can't get it out, sir.

01:37:58.128 --> 01:37:59.337
I've told him.

01:37:59.462 --> 01:38:00.630
Take the...

01:38:00.672 --> 01:38:02.132
Walker, help him with his phone.

01:38:02.215 --> 01:38:03.466
Walker,
get a job...

01:38:03.508 --> 01:38:05.635
Frazer,
stop talking and help him with his phone.

01:38:05.677 --> 01:38:07.345
I've got it now.
I got it, sir.

01:38:07.470 --> 01:38:09.222
Would you hold it?

01:38:09.305 --> 01:38:10.974
I don't think that's period.

01:38:12.183 --> 01:38:15.729
Corporal Jones
and I have discovered a crystal radio set in...

01:38:15.812 --> 01:38:17.022
Under his desk

01:38:17.147 --> 01:38:20.734
and top-secret documents
written in German.

01:38:32.495 --> 01:38:35.165
I've locked him into
the church hall until...

01:38:37.834 --> 01:38:40.003
Perhaps I should start

01:38:40.754 --> 01:38:45.008
on the less
celebrated achievements of the platoon.

01:38:46.718 --> 01:38:50.096
Now, affected by
a plague of hedgehogs,

01:38:50.180 --> 01:38:55.018
several of us undertook to clear the
farm using only a hosepipe

01:38:55.894 --> 01:38:58.355
and two strands of lead piping.
