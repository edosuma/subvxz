WEBVTT

00:08.580 --> 00:10.879
JOE. HOW DO I LOOK?

00:10.880 --> 00:12.080
YOU LOOK ZIPPER-POPPING
GOOD, BABY.

00:13.420 --> 00:16.079
I WAS ANGLING FOR A SIMPLE
"LOVELY," BUT I'LL TAKE IT.

00:16.080 --> 00:18.209
SO IS ALL THIS FOR
ME, OR IS THIS, UH,

00:18.210 --> 00:20.039
TO MAKE YOUR OLD COLLEGE
BOYFRIEND JEALOUS?

00:20.040 --> 00:21.169
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

00:21.170 --> 00:23.290
BUT YOU WANT TO BRING YOUR A-GAME
WHEN YOU'RE HAVING DINNER WITH AN EX.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.209
I ONLY HAVE AN A-GAME, SWEETIE.

00:26.210 --> 00:28.999
SO HOW DID YOU AND
DOUG RECONNECT AGAIN?

00:29.000 --> 00:31.919
HE JUST FRIENDED ME OUT OF THE BLUE. BUT
IT'S BEEN GREAT SEEING HIS PICTURES.

00:31.920 --> 00:34.290
HIS WIFE, HIS KIDS, HIS
BREAKFAST, HIS LUNCH, HIS DINNER.

00:35.790 --> 00:37.999
OH, HE'S ONE OF THOSE GUYS WHO POSTS
ALL THE PICTURES OF HIS FOOD?

00:38.000 --> 00:39.079
I HATE THAT.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.209
IT'S CUTE.

00:40.210 --> 00:41.749
NO, IT'S REALLY NOT CUTE.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.289
SO HOW LONG DID YOU AND, UM...

00:44.290 --> 00:46.169
FOOD POSTER BOY GO OUT?

00:46.170 --> 00:48.119
OH, WE SPENT A SEMESTER
TOGETHER IN MEXICO,

00:48.120 --> 00:51.120
AND AFTER SIX MONTHS, I WAS
COMPLETELY FLUENT IN TEQUILA.

00:53.120 --> 00:53.960
WHY'D YOU BREAK UP?

00:53.961 --> 00:56.039
WELL, SOMETIMES THINGS ARE
JUST TOO HOT TO LAST.

00:56.040 --> 00:58.709
I MEAN, UNLESS YOU'RE MARRIED.

00:58.710 --> 01:01.039
AND THEN THEY'RE JUST SO HOT...

01:01.040 --> 01:02.960
YOU JUST...

01:05.830 --> 01:06.959
HELP ME OUT HERE, JOE?

01:06.960 --> 01:07.960
NO, THIS IS FUN FOR ME.

AMAZING 10TH BIRTHDAY PARTY.

01:35.750 --> 01:37.459
HERE'S THE PIZZA,

01:37.460 --> 01:38.919
HERE'S THE HOT DOGS,

01:38.920 --> 01:40.080
HERE'S THE CAKE.

01:41.620 --> 01:42.999
ANY PICTURES OF STEVIE?

01:43.000 --> 01:44.169
UM...

01:44.170 --> 01:46.580
DON'T BE SILLY, MEL.
YOU CAN'T EAT THE KID.

01:47.960 --> 01:49.209
PLUS, YOU KNOW,

01:49.210 --> 01:52.209
THE FOOD DOESN'T SAY "OH, DAD, DON'T
TAKE MY PICTURE" AREN'T I RIGHT, DOUG?

01:52.210 --> 01:54.079
EXACTLY.

01:54.080 --> 01:54.960
WANT SOME MORE COFFEE?

01:54.961 --> 01:57.999
OH, NO THANKS. HALF A CUP IS ALL
MY BODY CAN HANDLE THESE DAYS.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
REALLY? I REMEMBER WHEN YOUR
BODY COULD HANDLE HALF A KEG.

02:02.580 --> 02:04.789
OH, MAN. I MISS BEING
YOUNG AND DUMB.

02:04.790 --> 02:06.999
WELL, I'VE GOT TO GET
BACK TO THE HOTEL.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.829
THE INSURANCE CONFERENCE STARTS TOMORROW,
AND I SIGNED UP FOR A 7:00 AM SEMINAR.

02:09.830 --> 02:10.879
7:00 AM?

02:10.880 --> 02:13.619
WOW, YOU'RE STILL A
WILD MAN, DIABLO.

02:13.620 --> 02:15.119
DIABLO.

02:15.120 --> 02:17.999
NO ONE'S CALLED ME
THAT IN A LONG TIME.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.919
HEY, SPEAKING OF DIABLO,

02:19.920 --> 02:22.959
DO YOU STILL HAVE THAT LITTLE
PRESENT I GAVE YOU DOWN IN CABO?

02:22.960 --> 02:25.959
CABO, WHOO, THOSE
WERE CRAZY TIMES.

02:25.960 --> 02:27.920
WELL, YOU TELL DEB AND
THE KIDS WE SAY HI.

02:28.920 --> 02:30.879
GREAT MEETING YOU, JOE.
THANKS AGAIN FOR DINNER.

02:30.880 --> 02:32.539
I'LL BE POSTING PICTURES
OF YOUR SIRLOIN.

02:32.540 --> 02:34.080
I'M HONORED.

02:35.880 --> 02:37.039
BYE.

02:37.040 --> 02:38.999
DIABLO?

02:39.000 --> 02:41.919
DOUG WAS KIND OF A BAD BOY.
THAT WAS WHAT WE CALLED HIM.

02:41.920 --> 02:44.540
BACK IN THOSE DAYS, HE COULD
DOWN AN ENTIRE CUP OF COFFEE.

02:45.540 --> 02:47.920
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NOTICED, MEL, BUT
I'VE BEEN WORKING ON MY THIRD CUP HERE.

02:49.620 --> 02:51.419
- HEY.
- HEY.

02:51.420 --> 02:53.539
IT IS SO COOL WATCHING
THESE AUDITIONS

02:53.540 --> 02:54.829
FOR "CASSANDRA."

02:54.830 --> 02:57.289
IF WE GET THE RIGHT ACTRESS, THIS
COULD BE A GREAT LITTLE FILM.

02:57.290 --> 02:59.710
OH. THEN THIS FILM'S GONNA SUCK.

03:01.460 --> 03:03.209
A CERTAIN GRAD STUDENT PRODUCER,

03:03.210 --> 03:05.879
IVANA, HAS ALREADY MADE
THE CHOICE FOR US.

03:05.880 --> 03:07.879
OH, MCKENNA CEDERSTROM.

03:07.880 --> 03:10.880
APPARENTLY CEDERSTROM IS
SWEDISH FOR "RUIN YOUR FILM."

03:12.540 --> 03:15.669
HOLD ON. I SAW HER
AUDITION, SHE WAS AWFUL.

03:15.670 --> 03:16.829
TOTALLY WRONG.

03:16.830 --> 03:19.079
YOU KNOW, CASSANDRA
IS SNARKY AND EDGY.

03:19.080 --> 03:20.880
THIS GIRL READ THE PART LIKE
SHE WAS SOME SORT OF...

03:21.880 --> 03:23.210
(groans) CHEERLEADER.

03:24.620 --> 03:26.209
(laughs)

03:26.210 --> 03:27.960
"SPECIAL SKILLS: CHEERLEADER."

03:29.330 --> 03:30.959
OUR MOVIE'S DOOMED. IT'S DOOMED.

03:30.960 --> 03:33.619
NO, I'LL JUST EXPLAIN THINGS TO IVANA.
SHE'LL UNDERSTAND.

03:33.620 --> 03:35.789
I'M SORRY, WHERE DO YOU THINK
I'VE BEEN THE LAST 90 MINUTES?

03:35.790 --> 03:37.249
TRYING TO TALK
IVANA OUT OF THIS.

03:37.250 --> 03:38.579
I BET YOU WERE BEING WHINY.

03:38.580 --> 03:40.419
WHEN YOU ARGUE WITH PEOPLE
YOU ALWAYS GET WHINY.

03:40.420 --> 03:41.830
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

03:43.580 --> 03:44.580
YEAH, I JUST HEARD THAT.

03:45.790 --> 03:47.789
SO WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
THAT WHEN WE WERE DATING?

03:47.790 --> 03:49.379
WELL, I DIDN'T WANT TO
HURT YOUR FEELINGS,

03:49.380 --> 03:51.000
BUT NOW I DON'T CARE
IF YOU GET ALL POUTY.

03:52.540 --> 03:53.540
OKAY.

03:56.750 --> 03:58.000
YEAH, SEE? I DON'T CARE.

04:00.750 --> 04:02.919
IVANA, HEY. IT'S LENNOX SCANLON.

04:02.920 --> 04:05.709
I WAS WONDERING IF WE COULD TALK
ABOUT THE CHOICE FOR CASSANDRA?

04:05.710 --> 04:07.829
LOOK, MCKENNA IS A
PEPPY LITTLE ACTRESS,

04:07.830 --> 04:10.290
BUT SHE'S NOT RIGHT FOR THIS.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.209
YES, EXACTLY.

04:13.210 --> 04:16.380
WE ALL WANT TO MAKE THE
BEST MOVIE WE CAN.

04:17.500 --> 04:19.829
YES, YES. WE DO HAVE TO
BE ON THE SAME TEAM.

04:19.830 --> 04:21.460
GOOD, GREAT. THANK YOU.

04:22.710 --> 04:24.500
IT'S MCKENNA OR SHE'S
PULLING THE PLUG.

04:25.880 --> 04:28.249
TURNS OUT MCKENNA IS HER LITTLE
SISTER IN KAPPA NU GAMMA.

04:28.250 --> 04:30.670
THAT MUST BE GREEK FOR
"RUIN YOUR FILM."

04:33.000 --> 04:34.419
SO, UM...

04:34.420 --> 04:35.919
MELLY, JUST CURIOUS.

04:35.920 --> 04:37.169
WHAT WAS THE, UM,

04:37.170 --> 04:39.379
PRESENT THING THAT DIABLO
WAS TALKING ABOUT?

04:39.380 --> 04:41.789
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
HE GOES BY DOUG NOW,

04:41.790 --> 04:43.789
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:43.790 --> 04:45.999
- I CAN'T REMEMBER.
- REALLY?

04:46.000 --> 04:47.709
WELL, DIABLO SEEMED TO REMEMBER.

04:47.710 --> 04:49.789
AND THEN THINGS GOT AWKWARD AND
YOU TRIED TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.789
I DON'T DO THAT.

04:51.790 --> 04:54.920
HEY, DID YOU KNOW THAT BENJAMIN FRANKLIN
WAS OUR FIRST POSTMASTER GENERAL?

04:56.250 --> 04:57.749
HE DISCOVERED ELECTRICITY,

04:57.750 --> 04:59.880
HE'S ON THE 100 DOLLAR BILL.
THAT IS SOME RESUME.

05:01.330 --> 05:02.920
WOW. WHAT WAS THE GIFT?

05:03.960 --> 05:05.169
PUKA SHELLS.

05:05.170 --> 05:08.039
YEAH, IT WAS A NECKLACE. I DIDN'T
WANT TO TELL HIM I THREW IT OUT.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.879
PUKA SHELLS, SERIOUSLY?

05:09.880 --> 05:11.919
THAT WAS HIS IDEA OF
A SPECIAL PRESENT?

05:11.920 --> 05:14.120
NO WONDER I DUMPED HIM, HUH?

05:15.120 --> 05:18.209
COME ON, EVERYONE WHO WANTS
TO HAVE SEX, FOLLOW ME.

05:18.210 --> 05:19.750
OOH!

05:25.710 --> 05:27.879
OH, MR. LONGO.

05:27.880 --> 05:30.039
I HAVE A DELIVERY FOR YOU.

05:30.040 --> 05:32.879
WELL, PUT IT RIGHT
OVER HERE, PLEASE.

05:32.880 --> 05:34.119
OH, I FORGOT TO LIGHT A CANDLE.

05:34.120 --> 05:36.420
OH, NO NO, MR. LONGO.
STAY RIGHT THERE.

05:42.880 --> 05:45.079
YOU'RE STILL A WILD MAN, DIABLO.

05:45.080 --> 05:46.619
SPEAKING OF DIABLO...

05:46.620 --> 05:48.999
DO YOU STILL HAVE THAT
LITTLE PRESENT I GAVE YOU?

05:49.000 --> 05:51.499
OH, BOY. THOSE WERE CRAZY TIMES.

05:51.500 --> 05:52.749
CRAZY TIMES.

05:52.750 --> 05:54.960
(echoing) GAVE YOU.

05:55.960 --> 05:56.960
DIABLO.

05:57.920 --> 05:59.669
YOUR TATTOO.

05:59.670 --> 06:00.879
THAT'S WHAT HE GAVE YOU.

06:00.880 --> 06:03.499
NOBODY FONDLY REMEMBERS
PUKA SHELLS.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.289
YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:05.290 --> 06:07.879
I NOW RECALL THIS IS
WHAT DOUG GAVE ME.

06:07.880 --> 06:09.789
THANK YOU FOR JOGGING MY MEMORY.

06:09.790 --> 06:12.749
ANYWAY, WHERE WERE WE, MR.
LONGO.

06:12.750 --> 06:15.459
WE'RE NOWHERE. DIABLO'S THE
NAME OF YOUR EX-BOYFRIEND.

06:15.460 --> 06:17.079
AND THERE HE IS RIGHT THERE.

06:17.080 --> 06:18.669
YOU ALWAYS LIKED
THE LITTLE DEVIL.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.619
YEAH, BEFORE I FOUND OUT IT
WAS SOME OTHER GUY'S LOGO.

06:20.620 --> 06:22.169
- ARE YOU JEALOUS?
- NO.

06:22.170 --> 06:23.379
NO, I AM NOT JEALOUS.

06:23.380 --> 06:25.879
I AM VERY AWARE I'M NOT THE ONLY GUY
YOU'VE EVER BEEN WITH, ALL RIGHT?

06:25.880 --> 06:27.829
BUT I DIDN'T THINK ANY
OF YOUR EX-BOYFRIENDS

06:27.830 --> 06:29.789
WOULD BE HERE WITH
US IN OUR BEDROOM.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.709
WAVING THE LITTLE
PITCHFORK AT ME.

06:31.710 --> 06:33.209
IT'S PART OF MY PAST.

06:33.210 --> 06:34.249
IT'S BEHIND ME.

06:34.250 --> 06:36.960
MAY BE BEHIND YOU, BUT IT'S
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME, BABY.

06:38.620 --> 06:41.119
JOE, WHY ARE WE TALKING?
WHY AREN'T WE...

06:41.120 --> 06:43.619
BECAUSE THERE'S ANOTHER GUY
IN THE ROOM WITH US NOW.

06:43.620 --> 06:46.379
IF IT'S BOTHERING YOU THAT MUCH,
LET'S JUST TURN OUT THE LIGHTS.

06:46.380 --> 06:47.789
EW, TURN OUT THE LIGHTS?

06:47.790 --> 06:48.919
WHO AM I, MY GRANDPA?

06:48.920 --> 06:50.249
COME ON!

06:50.250 --> 06:52.669
I LIKE LOOKING. LOOKING IS
PART OF THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE.

06:52.670 --> 06:54.579
OKAY, HERE'S A BETTER IDEA.

06:54.580 --> 06:55.920
STOP THINKING ABOUT IT.

06:57.710 --> 06:59.120
ALL RIGHT. I'LL GIVE IT A TRY.

07:01.750 --> 07:02.919
NOPE. I CAN'T DO IT.
I CAN'T DO IT.

07:02.920 --> 07:04.499
BECAUSE I'M EITHER GONNA
BE LOOKING AT IT,

07:04.500 --> 07:06.499
OR I'M GONNA BE HOLDING ONTO IT.

07:06.500 --> 07:08.999
WELL, ENOUGH OF THE SWEET TALK.
I AM NO LONGER IN THE MOOD.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.380
YOU THINK?

07:24.670 --> 07:29.579
AND EVEN THOUGH IVANA HAS FORCED US
TO CAST HER FELLOW SORORITY AIRHEAD

07:29.580 --> 07:31.499
AS CASSANDRA, I WILL
CONTINUE TO FIGHT.

07:31.500 --> 07:33.169
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT ARTISTS DO.

07:33.170 --> 07:34.750
UH-HUH, UH-HUH.

07:36.540 --> 07:38.789
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GONNA SIT
THIS MCKENNA PERSON DOWN

07:38.790 --> 07:41.499
AND TELL HER EVERYTHING SHE DID
IN THE AUDITION WAS WRONG.

07:41.500 --> 07:42.620
YEAH, PEOPLE LOVE TO HEAR THAT.

07:45.170 --> 07:46.749
I MEAN, IN A NICE WAY.

07:46.750 --> 07:48.919
AND I WILL EXPLAIN TO
HER WHO CASSANDRA IS.

07:48.920 --> 07:50.669
WHAT DRIVES HER.

07:50.670 --> 07:53.120
I TRULY BELIEVE I
CAN SAVE THIS FILM.

07:54.290 --> 07:56.460
AND PROVE ZANDER WRONG
WHICH IS ALWAYS A PLUS.

08:00.040 --> 08:02.579
SERIOUSLY? CAN YOU NOT SEE ME
BANGING POTS AND PANS UP HERE?

08:02.580 --> 08:05.329
HOPING YOU'LL ASK
ME WHAT'S WRONG.

08:05.330 --> 08:07.379
OH, I THOUGHT YOU WERE
MAD ON MY BEHALF.

08:07.380 --> 08:10.039
NO. WHEN DID YOU
STOP TAKING HINTS?

08:10.040 --> 08:11.500
DID YOU SUDDENLY BECOME A MAN?

08:12.830 --> 08:14.499
YOU AND JOE HAD A FIGHT.

08:14.500 --> 08:16.379
OH, IS THIS ABOUT YOUR OLD
BOYFRIEND WHO CAME OVER?

08:16.380 --> 08:18.499
IT WASN'T REALLY ABOUT DOUG,

08:18.500 --> 08:19.919
IT WAS ABOUT ANOTHER GUY.

08:19.920 --> 08:21.620
- WHO?
- SATAN.

08:23.120 --> 08:24.789
YOU KNOW MY LITTLE DEVIL TATTOO?

08:24.790 --> 08:27.039
I TRY NOT TO THINK
ABOUT IT, BUT YES.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.289
WELL, I GOT IT AS
A TRIBUTE TO DOUG

08:29.290 --> 08:30.919
ON THE SPUR OF THE
ALCOHOL SOAKED MOMENT.

08:30.920 --> 08:32.749
IT'S A GOOD THING I RAN OUT
OF PESOS, OTHERWISE I'D HAVE

08:32.750 --> 08:33.920
A SNAKE DOWN THE
SIDE OF MY NECK.

08:35.040 --> 08:37.579
ANYWAY, NOW THAT JOE
KNOWS DIABLO IS DOUG,

08:37.580 --> 08:39.379
TO HIM IT'S LIKE HAVING
ANOTHER MAN IN THE BEDROOM.

08:39.380 --> 08:40.540
AND NOT IN A GOOD WAY.

08:41.500 --> 08:43.120
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT
HUSBAND OF MINE?

08:44.120 --> 08:45.329
COMPLETELY.

08:45.330 --> 08:47.039
I KNOW, RIGHT?
IT'S COMPLETELY...

08:47.040 --> 08:48.579
WAIT, WHAT? YOU AGREE WITH HIM?

08:48.580 --> 08:50.419
WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON?

08:50.420 --> 08:51.999
UH, THE SIDE OF YOUR MARRIAGE.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.619
TRY TO SEE IT FROM
JOE'S POINT OF VIEW.

08:53.620 --> 08:54.999
FROM JOE'S POINT OF VIEW?

08:55.000 --> 08:56.420
IT LOOKS FANTASTIC.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.119
AUNT MEL, BE SERIOUS.

09:00.120 --> 09:02.619
TO JOE IT'S LIKE YOU TOOK
DOUG'S OLD LOVE LETTERS

09:02.620 --> 09:04.289
AND GLUED THEM TO YOUR ASS.

09:04.290 --> 09:06.620
WELL, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
SHRED MY BUTT?

09:07.960 --> 09:09.829
WELL, YOU CAN GET
RID OF THE PROBLEM.

09:09.830 --> 09:11.620
I JUST MARRIED HIM.

09:13.880 --> 09:16.669
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT
LASER TATTOO REMOVAL?

09:16.670 --> 09:19.499
WHAT MAKES MORE SENSE HERE?
HAVING AGONIZING BUTT SURGERY,

09:19.500 --> 09:22.460
OR HAVING MY HUSBAND GET OVER IT SO
HE CAN HAVE SEX WITH HIS HOT WIFE?

09:23.920 --> 09:24.920
ME!

09:26.330 --> 09:28.289
OKAY, AUNT MEL, THEY
DON'T CUT YOU OPEN.

09:28.290 --> 09:30.329
IT'S...

09:30.330 --> 09:32.580
IT'S LIKE A FACIAL
FOR YOUR TUSH.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.040
THANK YOU. YOU'VE JUST
RUINED FACIALS FOR ME.

09:39.420 --> 09:41.669
I AM SO, SO HAPPY TO
BE IN YOUR MOVIE.

09:41.670 --> 09:44.249
THE MOMENT IVANA TOLD ME ABOUT
THE PART OF CASSANDRA...

09:44.250 --> 09:45.459
CASSANDRA.

09:45.460 --> 09:46.499
THAT'S WHAT I SAID, CASSANDRA.

09:46.500 --> 09:47.539
CASSANDRA.

09:47.540 --> 09:48.670
RIGHT, CASSANDRA.

09:49.670 --> 09:51.419
OH, BOY.

09:51.420 --> 09:54.169
WHY DON'T WE JUST TALK
ABOUT THE CHARACTER?

09:54.170 --> 09:56.420
OF CASSANDRA?

09:57.960 --> 09:59.420
SHE'S BASICALLY...

10:00.710 --> 10:02.789
THE SMARTEST PERSON
IN THE WORLD.

10:02.790 --> 10:04.419
SHE'S VERY PERCEPTIVE.

10:04.420 --> 10:07.709
SHE'S ABLE TO SEE THE ABUNDANCE
OF MEDIOCRITY IN HUMANKIND.

10:07.710 --> 10:10.079
SHE TRIES TO BE AMUSED,

10:10.080 --> 10:12.330
BUT IT'S ALWAYS A STRUGGLE.

10:14.420 --> 10:15.620
I CAN DO MY OWN MAKEUP.

10:17.710 --> 10:20.079
YOU KNOW WHAT? WHY DON'T WE
JUST START WITH THE SCRIPT.

10:20.080 --> 10:22.919
HERE, CASSANDRA HAS JUST FOUND
OUT THAT HER OLD BOYFRIEND

10:22.920 --> 10:25.330
HAS TURNED INTO AN ANNOYING HIPSTER.
SO READ THE FIRST LINE.

10:26.620 --> 10:28.290
"I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN."

10:30.540 --> 10:33.329
THAT WAS SO...

10:33.330 --> 10:34.499
BUBBLY.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.209
BUBBLY'S ONE OF MY
SPECIAL SKILLS.

10:36.210 --> 10:37.539
IT'S WHAT PEOPLE LIKE ABOUT ME.

10:37.540 --> 10:39.379
THAT'S WHY I WANTED
TO TRY ACTING,

10:39.380 --> 10:40.829
SO MORE PEOPLE WOULD LIKE ME.

10:40.830 --> 10:42.959
AND IT'S KIND OF
LIKE CHEERLEADING,

10:42.960 --> 10:45.379
EXCEPT YOU GET TO SAY MORE THAN
"HEY, HEY, DON'T GET DOWN,

10:45.380 --> 10:47.419
"YOU CAN STILL TURN IT AROUND."

10:47.420 --> 10:49.460
WE'VE BEEN SAYING
THAT A LOT THIS YEAR.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.879
TRY THE LINE AGAIN,
AND THIS TIME,

10:52.880 --> 10:55.210
BE VERY, VERY JUDGMENTAL.

10:58.580 --> 11:00.290
"I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN."

11:01.790 --> 11:03.289
OH, BOY.

11:03.290 --> 11:05.210
I CAN SUPPLY MY OWN WARDROBE.

11:06.380 --> 11:08.079
I CAN'T IMAGINE
YOU'D HAVE ANYTHING

11:08.080 --> 11:09.999
THAT CASSANDRA WOULD WEAR.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.419
SHE DOESN'T DRESS LIKE YOU.

11:11.420 --> 11:13.169
SHE DRESSES...

11:13.170 --> 11:15.459
WELL, LIKE ME.

11:15.460 --> 11:17.379
YOU KNOW WHAT, MAYBE
IF YOU WORE THIS,

11:17.380 --> 11:18.709
YOU WOULD FEEL MORE LIKE HER.

11:18.710 --> 11:21.289
OH, YEAH. I DIDN'T FEEL
LIKE A CHEERLEADER

11:21.290 --> 11:23.039
UNTIL THE FIRST TIME
I PUT ON MY OUTFIT.

11:23.040 --> 11:24.460
- FUNNY STORY...
- I DOUBT IT.

11:26.420 --> 11:28.379
OKAY, NOW.

11:28.380 --> 11:29.789
SLOUCH.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.959
KEEP YOUR VOICE LOW.

11:31.960 --> 11:33.459
AND THINK.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.379
I KNOW IT'S HARD.

11:35.380 --> 11:38.460
BUT THINK ABOUT HOW
ROTTEN THE WORLD IS.

11:43.670 --> 11:45.459
"I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN."

11:45.460 --> 11:46.460
AGAIN.

11:47.460 --> 11:48.619
"I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN."

11:48.620 --> 11:49.620
KEEP GOING.

11:51.170 --> 11:52.499
"LOOK AT YOU, SERGIO.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.539
"WHERE'D YOU GET THOSE
SKINNY HIPSTER JEANS?

11:54.540 --> 11:56.290
"FROM SOME ORGAN
GRINDER'S MONKEY?"

11:57.540 --> 11:59.170
SHE'S GOT IT. I
THINK SHE'S GOT IT.

12:01.580 --> 12:03.289
WHAT UPSET ME THE MOST, NATE,

12:03.290 --> 12:05.329
WAS THAT MEL DIDN'T
UNDERSTAND WHY I WAS UPSET.

12:05.330 --> 12:07.169
SHE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
THAT I DON'T WANT TO SEE

12:07.170 --> 12:09.499
A REMINDER OF SOME OTHER GUY
WHEN I'M IN BED WITH MY WIFE.

12:09.500 --> 12:10.709
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
IT KEEPS...

12:10.710 --> 12:12.959
IT KEEPS MY MORALE...

12:12.960 --> 12:14.669
LOW, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

12:14.670 --> 12:16.539
JOE, YOU LOVE MEL, RIGHT?

12:16.540 --> 12:17.919
YEAH, I'M CRAZY ABOUT HER.

12:17.920 --> 12:20.079
AND SHE MAKES YOU
HAPPY IN THE BEDROOM?

12:20.080 --> 12:21.249
YEAH.

12:21.250 --> 12:23.079
MANY, MANY TIMES A WEEK.

12:23.080 --> 12:26.169
THEN YOU, MY FRIEND, ARE OUT
OF YOUR HOT TEMPERED MIND.

12:26.170 --> 12:28.169
YOU SHOULD BE HIGH-FIVING
THAT LITTLE DEVIL.

12:28.170 --> 12:30.329
AND EVERY OTHER LITTLE DEVIL
THAT'S MADE MEL WHO SHE IS.

12:30.330 --> 12:32.119
YOU'RE GETTING THE BENEFIT.

12:32.120 --> 12:34.329
- NATE, LISTEN...
- SHUT UP FOR ONE SECOND.

12:34.330 --> 12:37.789
IMAGINE THERE'S AN
AMAZING RESTAURANT

12:37.790 --> 12:39.119
THAT SERVES WHATEVER YOU WANT.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.789
AND IT'S OPEN 24 HOURS
EVERY DAY, EVEN CHRISTMAS.

12:41.790 --> 12:44.999
BUT SUDDENLY YOU DECIDE YOU DON'T
WANT TO PATRONIZE THE PLACE

12:45.000 --> 12:46.959
BECAUSE SOMEBODY
CARVED THEIR NAME

12:46.960 --> 12:48.380
ON A STALL IN THE BATHROOM.

12:50.920 --> 12:53.209
BUT IT'S MY FAVORITE
STALL, NATE.

12:53.210 --> 12:57.079
I MEAN, IT'S THE ONLY STALL I CAN RELAX IN.
HOW AM I GOING TO RELAX?

12:57.080 --> 12:58.749
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW
GOOD YOU HAVE IT.

12:58.750 --> 13:00.749
YOU KNOW THE MOST FUN I GET
TO HAVE IN MY BEDROOM?

13:00.750 --> 13:02.249
PRETENDING TO BE ASLEEP

13:02.250 --> 13:03.750
WHEN THE BABY CRIES.

13:06.380 --> 13:09.749
"SERGIO, YOU THINK I LIKE KNOWING
MORE THAN EVERYBODY ELSE?

13:09.750 --> 13:11.079
"ACTUALLY, I DO.

13:11.080 --> 13:13.080
"IT'S THE ONLY THING THAT
MAKES ME THIS CHEERFUL."

13:14.540 --> 13:15.829
IT'S UNCANNY.

13:15.830 --> 13:17.080
SHE'S PERFECT.

13:18.380 --> 13:21.209
WELL, WE'RE GONNA NEED ANOTHER
WORK SESSION TOMORROW.

13:21.210 --> 13:23.209
YOU KNOW, THERE'S STILL
A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

13:23.210 --> 13:26.579
I CAN'T WAIT. I AM SO,
SO HAPPY ABOUT THIS.

13:26.580 --> 13:28.790
- STAY IN CHARACTER.
- OR WHATEVER.

13:30.960 --> 13:32.120
THAT'S GOOD.

13:34.330 --> 13:37.119
I HAVE TO SAY, I AM DELIGHTED
THAT YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND.

13:37.120 --> 13:40.379
YEAH, HONEY, I REALIZED
I WAS OVERREACTING,

13:40.380 --> 13:42.119
SO I'M OVER IT.

13:42.120 --> 13:44.210
GOOD FOR YOU, AMIGO.

13:46.330 --> 13:47.500
SO, WHAT MADE YOU COME AROUND?

13:48.500 --> 13:50.289
YOU KNOW.

13:50.290 --> 13:52.209
I JUST HAD TO DO SOME THINKING.

13:52.210 --> 13:54.669
WELL NOW, LET'S DO SOME KISSING.

13:54.670 --> 13:56.710
OH, OKAY. KISSING IT IS. YEAH.

13:58.580 --> 14:01.380
HEY, GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF ME.

14:04.830 --> 14:06.119
MM.

14:06.120 --> 14:07.829
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.

14:07.830 --> 14:10.079
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY
GUYS SHE SAID THAT TO?

14:10.080 --> 14:14.709
- JOE, JOE.
- (Devil listing names)

14:14.710 --> 14:17.210
- JOE.
- MEL!

14:18.210 --> 14:19.669
DON'T TALK.

14:19.670 --> 14:23.119
OOH. BOSS ME AROUND.

14:23.120 --> 14:26.250
SHE'S ON TOP OF ME.
I CAN'T BREATHE.

14:28.670 --> 14:29.709
I CAN'T DO IT.

14:29.710 --> 14:31.789
I'M SORRY. I CAN'T CONCENTRATE.

14:31.790 --> 14:33.039
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

14:33.040 --> 14:34.669
DIABLO, ALL RIGHT?
HE'S IN MY HEAD.

14:34.670 --> 14:36.289
I DON'T WANT HIM IN
THERE, BUT HE'S IN THERE.

14:36.290 --> 14:38.789
GOD, IT'S LIKE I NEED A
SEXORCIST OR SOMETHING.

14:38.790 --> 14:42.209
REALLY, JOE? IS THIS THE WAY IT'S
GONNA BE THE REST OF OUR LIVES?

14:42.210 --> 14:44.790
I'M STAYING RIGHT HERE.

14:52.170 --> 14:54.329
- HEY. -OH, HONEY. I'VE
BEEN DOING SOME RESEARCH

14:54.330 --> 14:55.499
ON TATTOO REMOVAL,

14:55.500 --> 14:58.169
EVEN THOUGH IT'S PAINFUL
AND TAKES HOURS

14:58.170 --> 15:01.169
AND HOURS, AND IN MOST
CASES LEAVES SCARS,

15:01.170 --> 15:02.749
I HAVE DECIDED THAT FOR YOU,

15:02.750 --> 15:04.170
I AM WILLING TO GO
THROUGH WITH IT.

15:05.290 --> 15:06.749
OH, HONEY.

15:06.750 --> 15:08.499
THAT IS SUCH AN
AMAZING SACRIFICE.

15:08.500 --> 15:09.539
I KNOW.

15:09.540 --> 15:11.120
THANK YOU FOR DOING IT.

15:12.500 --> 15:13.540
WHAT?

15:14.710 --> 15:17.079
YOU ACTUALLY WANT ME TO GO
THROUGH SOME CRAZY PROCEDURE

15:17.080 --> 15:19.249
WHERE THEY SHOOT HOT
LASERS AT MY BUTT?

15:19.250 --> 15:22.120
THEY COULD TURN IT UP TOO HIGH
AND TAKE OFF A WHOLE CHEEK.

15:23.790 --> 15:25.119
YOU JUST OFFERED TO DO IT?

15:25.120 --> 15:26.619
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO SAY NO.

15:26.620 --> 15:28.789
DON'T YOU KNOW AN EMPTY
GESTURE WHEN YOU HEAR ONE?

15:28.790 --> 15:30.579
YOU KNOW, LIKE "DO YOU
NEED HELP MOVING?"

15:30.580 --> 15:32.119
OR "I'D BE HAPPY
TO WALK YOUR DOG."

15:32.120 --> 15:33.580
NOBODY ACTUALLY WANTS YOU
TO TAKE THEM UP ON IT.

15:34.580 --> 15:36.119
YEAH, I DON'T THINK I'M
BEING UNREASONABLE.

15:36.120 --> 15:38.829
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF I HAD AN EX-GIRLFRIEND'S
NAME TATTOOED ON MY PRIVATE PARTS?

15:38.830 --> 15:40.459
BE MY GUEST! FROM
WHAT I REMEMBER,

15:40.460 --> 15:41.499
IT HURTS LIKE HELL.

15:41.500 --> 15:44.079
GO AHEAD. HAVE ALL YOUR
EX-GIRLFRIENDS NAMES PUT DOWN THERE.

15:44.080 --> 15:45.080
AND THEIR PHONE NUMBERS TOO.

15:46.500 --> 15:48.170
I'VE GOT PLENTY OF ROOM FOR IT.

15:54.170 --> 15:57.879
OKAY, REMEMBER, ALL OF YOUR
WARDROBE BELONGS TO ME.

15:57.880 --> 15:59.380
SO TAKE GOOD CARE OF MY CLOTHES.

16:00.580 --> 16:03.249
DO YOU WANT ME TO SALUTE YOU
OR IS A SIMPLE BOW OKAY?

16:03.250 --> 16:05.330
(laughing)

16:07.210 --> 16:08.790
SHE'S SO GREAT.

16:10.250 --> 16:12.119
OKAY, WHY DON'T YOU TWO
REVIEW THE FINAL SCENE.

16:12.120 --> 16:13.669
I'M STILL LOOKING
FOR SOME PROPS.

16:13.670 --> 16:15.119
OKAY.

16:15.120 --> 16:18.169
SO LAST SCENE, I'LL READ SERGIO.

16:18.170 --> 16:19.999
SO LET ME JUST SET
THE SCENE FOR YOU.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.039
SO SERGIO IS CASSANDRA'S ON
AGAIN OFF AGAIN BOYFRIEND.

16:23.040 --> 16:25.170
A VERY, VERY TALENTED ARTIST.

16:26.790 --> 16:28.079
IT'S NOT BASED ON
ANYBODY BY THE WAY.

16:28.080 --> 16:29.999
(clears throat)

16:30.000 --> 16:32.210
"CASSANDRA, I THINK WE
SHOULD GET BACK TOGETHER."

16:33.210 --> 16:36.379
"SERGIO, IF WE GET BACK TOGETHER,
WE'RE JUST GONNA BREAK UP AGAIN.

16:36.380 --> 16:39.330
"FACE IT. YOU AND ME ARE
NEVER EVER GONNA WORK."

16:41.210 --> 16:44.539
YOU KNOW WHAT? SOMETHING'S
NOT QUITE RIGHT.

16:44.540 --> 16:45.959
I COULD BE GRUMPIER?

16:45.960 --> 16:47.959
- MORE NEGATIVE?
- NO, NO.

16:47.960 --> 16:49.209
NO, IT'S NOT YOU.

16:49.210 --> 16:50.170
IT'S THE SCRIPT.

16:52.120 --> 16:53.669
YEAH, IT'S JUST...

16:53.670 --> 16:54.670
JUST NEEDS A LITTLE TWEAK.

16:56.290 --> 16:59.119
OKAY. START IT FROM THERE.

16:59.120 --> 17:00.120
SURE.

17:01.290 --> 17:02.619
IF WE GET BACK TOGETHER,

17:02.620 --> 17:04.170
WE'RE JUST GONNA BREAK UP AGAIN.

17:05.250 --> 17:06.420
ARE YOU SURE, CASSANDRA?

17:08.960 --> 17:10.959
NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT, SERGIO,

17:10.960 --> 17:12.959
I WAS WRONG TO EVER LEAVE YOU.

17:12.960 --> 17:14.920
IT'S SO OBVIOUS WE
SHOULD BE TOGETHER.

17:15.920 --> 17:18.000
WE HAVE ALWAYS
BELONGED TOGETHER.

17:19.420 --> 17:20.500
OH, GOD.

17:21.750 --> 17:22.960
I WOULD TOTALLY SEE THIS FILM.

17:31.250 --> 17:32.540
(knocks on door)

17:33.540 --> 17:35.999
HEY, AUNT MEL. CAN I BORROW
THE FONDUE SET FOR THE MOVIE?

17:36.000 --> 17:38.169
WHY AM I JUST NOW LEARNING
THAT I HAVE A FONDUE SET?

17:38.170 --> 17:40.040
I MEAN, SURE.

17:42.620 --> 17:44.079
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:44.080 --> 17:46.249
TRYING TO REMOVE MY
TATTOO THE NATURAL WAY.

17:46.250 --> 17:48.959
BROWN SUGAR AND OLIVE OIL
ARE AN EXCELLENT EXFOLIANT.

17:48.960 --> 17:50.619
I FIGURE IF I SCRUB IT
SEVERAL TIMES A DAY,

17:50.620 --> 17:52.999
THE LITTLE DEVIL SHOULD
BE GONE IN ABOUT

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
24 YEARS.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.209
YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK?

17:56.210 --> 17:57.999
YEAH, BUT I WANT JOE
TO THINK I'M TRYING.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.039
I OFFERED TO HAVE IT
REMOVED PROFESSIONALLY,

18:00.040 --> 18:01.669
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN
HOW HAPPY HE WAS.

18:01.670 --> 18:03.499
OKAY, AUNT MEL, GIVE ME THAT.

18:03.500 --> 18:04.500
WE CAN BAKE COOKIES LATER.

18:05.500 --> 18:07.379
THE SOONER YOU GET THIS
TAKEN CARE OF FOR REAL,

18:07.380 --> 18:09.419
THE HAPPIER YOU AND JOE
ARE GONNA BE, OKAY?

18:09.420 --> 18:10.920
IT'S SO IRRITATING
WHEN YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:11.920 --> 18:14.579
WELL, I GUESS I GOTTA HAVE
IT REMOVED PROFESSIONALLY.

18:14.580 --> 18:15.709
NO MATTER HOW MUCH IT HURTS.

18:15.710 --> 18:17.959
HEY, SOMETIMES LOVE IS
JUST A PAIN IN THE ASS.

18:17.960 --> 18:19.920
REALLY? YOU WENT THERE?

18:22.920 --> 18:23.959
HEY, WHERE'S YOUR AUNT?

18:23.960 --> 18:25.749
I THOUGHT SHE DIDN'T HAVE
ANY APPOINTMENTS TODAY?

18:25.750 --> 18:26.879
WELL, SHE JUST MADE ONE.

18:26.880 --> 18:28.670
AT A PLACE THAT DOES
TATTOO REMOVAL.

18:29.670 --> 18:30.709
WHAT?

18:30.710 --> 18:33.999
YEAH, SHE SAID "I GOTTA
DO THIS FOR JOE,

18:34.000 --> 18:36.039
"EVEN IF IT HURTS." THEN
SHE RAN OUT OF HERE.

18:36.040 --> 18:38.710
AND THEN SHE RAN BACK IN, TOOK THREE
SHOTS OF TEQUILA, AND CALLED A CAB.

18:40.580 --> 18:42.209
WOW, SHE...

18:42.210 --> 18:43.330
SHE WOULD DO THAT FOR ME?

18:44.750 --> 18:45.750
SHE'D DO ANYTHING FOR YOU.

18:50.790 --> 18:54.789
ALL RIGHT, SO WE'VE DECIDED THAT
MCKENNA SHOULD STAY IN CHARACTER 24/7

18:54.790 --> 18:55.999
UNTIL AFTER WE
FINISH THE SHOOTING.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.539
OH, I LIKE YOUR COMMITMENT.

18:57.540 --> 18:58.960
THANKS. YOU GONNA
THROW ME A FISH?

19:00.580 --> 19:02.170
NICE. I MIGHT USE
THAT ONE FOR MYSELF.

19:04.080 --> 19:05.709
OH, WAIT. WHAT IS THIS?

19:05.710 --> 19:08.830
OH, I JUST MADE A COUPLE LITTLE
TWEAKS TO THE FINAL SCENE.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.379
WAIT, SERGIO AND CASSANDRA
CAN'T GET BACK TOGETHER.

19:12.380 --> 19:14.879
YOU MISSED THE WHOLE
POINT OF THE FILM.

19:14.880 --> 19:17.079
HER ENTIRE JOURNEY IS
TOWARDS INDEPENDENCE.

19:17.080 --> 19:19.539
SHE DOESN'T NEED A MAN TO COMPLETE
HER, AND THEY CERTAINLY DON'T

19:19.540 --> 19:21.250
"BELONG TOGETHER."

19:23.000 --> 19:23.920
I THOUGHT IT WORKED.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.460
- ZANDER.
- FINE, WE'LL CHANGE IT BACK.

19:31.670 --> 19:33.999
YOUR EX IS A WEE BIT CRANKY.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.459
YEAH, I MEAN...

19:35.460 --> 19:36.879
YOU THOUGHT THE CHANGES
WORKED, DIDN'T YOU?

19:36.880 --> 19:37.919
OF COURSE.

19:37.920 --> 19:40.459
AND I AM CASSANDRA.

19:40.460 --> 19:42.460
THE SMARTEST PERSON
IN THE WORLD.

19:47.830 --> 19:49.000
YEAH, THAT WORKS TOO.

19:53.580 --> 19:55.329
OW! WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME?

19:55.330 --> 19:57.290
WIPING THE AREA
WITH A COTTON BALL.

19:58.580 --> 20:00.500
DIAL BACK THE PRESSURE
A LITTLE, WILL YOU?

20:01.670 --> 20:02.879
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANNA DO THIS?

20:02.880 --> 20:05.330
YES, AND I'M DOING THIS FOR LOVE, SO
CAN YOU PICK UP THE PACE AND ZAP ME?

20:09.960 --> 20:12.419
MEL! DON'T.

20:12.420 --> 20:14.380
HERE WE GO. THIRD TIME TODAY.

20:15.710 --> 20:18.039
LISTEN, LENNOX TOLD ME WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT
TO DO, AND YOU DON'T NEED TO DO IT.

20:18.040 --> 20:19.749
NO, JOE, I'VE ALREADY
MADE UP MY MIND, OKAY?

20:19.750 --> 20:21.249
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING
TO COME BETWEEN US.

20:21.250 --> 20:22.829
AND NOTHING WILL. I'M
GONNA GET OVER IT.

20:22.830 --> 20:24.789
NO, YOU TRIED THAT,
AND IT DIDN'T WORK.

20:24.790 --> 20:26.959
LOOK, WE'LL FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT, ALL RIGHT?

20:26.960 --> 20:27.960
I PROMISE.

20:30.460 --> 20:31.539
OOH.

20:31.540 --> 20:32.919
HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

20:32.920 --> 20:34.499
THAT'S A VERY GOOD START.

20:34.500 --> 20:35.959
WHO DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING?

20:35.960 --> 20:36.960
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

20:38.620 --> 20:41.039
THIS IS ALL SO VERY SWEET.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.830
BUT YOU'VE STILL GOT TO
PAY FOR THE SESSION.

20:47.040 --> 20:48.879
- WOW.
- (sighs)

20:48.880 --> 20:50.669
YOU SURE GOT OVER IT.

20:50.670 --> 20:51.750
TWO TIMES.

20:53.040 --> 20:54.380
YEAH, I'M READY
TO MAKE IT THREE.

20:55.460 --> 20:57.209
WELL, USUALLY,

20:57.210 --> 20:59.289
SLAPPING A BAND-AID ON A PROBLEM

20:59.290 --> 21:00.920
DOESN'T WORK.

21:01.920 --> 21:02.830
THE THING IS THOUGH, HONEY,

21:02.831 --> 21:06.209
YOU NEED TO HAVE A BAND-AID THAT'S LARGE
ENOUGH TO COVER THE ENTIRE PROBLEM.

21:06.210 --> 21:08.669
WELL, IF YOU'RE READY TO GO
AGAIN, GENTLEMAN'S CHOICE.

21:08.670 --> 21:10.249
GENTLEMAN'S CHOICE.
OH MY GOODNESS.

21:10.250 --> 21:13.169
WELL, LET'S SEE. WHAT
DO WE HAVE HERE?

21:13.170 --> 21:15.879
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GOOD WITH
EITHER SPIDER-MAN OR BACON.

21:15.880 --> 21:17.330
EITHER ONE OF THOSE
IS COOL WITH ME.

21:18.330 --> 21:19.499
MAKE IT ONE OF EACH.

21:19.500 --> 21:20.920
- LET'S DO THIS.
- LET'S DO IT!
