WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.831
What happened to you yesterday?

00:04.000 --> 00:07.197
- I waited for you. You never came.
- Oh, I'm sorry. I got really busy.

00:07.360 --> 00:09.828
- How long did you wait?
- Five minutes.

00:10.760 --> 00:14.230
- Five minutes? That's it?
- No difference. You never showed up.

00:14.400 --> 00:15.958
Well, I could have.

00:16.120 --> 00:20.033
I mean, last week we waited for that
friend of Kramer's for like 40 minutes.

00:20.200 --> 00:21.633
We barely knew the guy.

00:21.800 --> 00:24.314
The longer you know someone,
the shorter you wait?

00:24.480 --> 00:27.472
- That's the way it works.
- When did you tell George to be here?

00:27.640 --> 00:29.915
I told him 10 minutes.
How long has it been?

00:30.080 --> 00:31.752
- About five.
- That's enough.

00:31.920 --> 00:33.239
Yeah.

00:40.680 --> 00:43.240
Early. All right.

00:45.960 --> 00:47.359
Cold.

00:52.680 --> 00:55.353
So I noticed you bounced
a cheque at the bodega.

00:55.520 --> 00:57.351
- How did you know about that?
- Marcelino.

00:57.520 --> 01:01.354
He taped it up on his cash register
with all of the other bad cheques.

01:01.520 --> 01:02.999
He can't do that.

01:03.160 --> 01:05.116
It's the only way you'll learn.

01:08.600 --> 01:11.160
Oh, these eggs are disgusting.

01:11.520 --> 01:14.557
Boy, this chicken should be
ashamed of himself.

01:14.720 --> 01:18.235
- Fantastic day, fantastic.
- What happened?

01:18.400 --> 01:21.551
Well, first, I'm brushing my teeth
and this piece of apple skin...

01:21.720 --> 01:25.030
...that must have been lodged
in there for days comes loose.

01:25.200 --> 01:27.839
- Fantastic.
- Then I'm at the foundation...

01:28.000 --> 01:30.036
- You're still doing that?
- Once in a while.

01:30.200 --> 01:31.189
When you feel guilty.

01:31.360 --> 01:33.749
No, occasionally I forget
to let the machine pick up.

01:33.920 --> 01:36.798
Anyway, they made this large donation
to a women's prison...

01:36.960 --> 01:39.520
...and I get to go down there
and check it out.

01:39.680 --> 01:41.113
- That's caged heat.
- Yeah.

01:41.720 --> 01:43.472
- What are you gonna do there?
- Nothing.

01:43.640 --> 01:47.792
Just stroll around the cellblocks,
maybe take in a shower fight.

01:49.600 --> 01:52.114
You got a bounced cheque
hanging up in the market...

01:52.280 --> 01:54.475
...over on Columbus.
- Yes, I know. I know.

01:54.640 --> 01:59.031
I noticed you chose
the clowns-with-balloon cheque design.

01:59.200 --> 02:01.350
It was a mistake.
The bank sent the wrong ones.

02:01.920 --> 02:03.876
Hey, look who's here.

02:04.040 --> 02:06.713
Hey, Kurt, this is Jerry
and George and Kramer.

02:06.880 --> 02:10.156
- Hey.
- Hey, Kurt, taste these eggs.

02:10.320 --> 02:12.959
No, I only eat cage-free, farm-fresh.

02:13.120 --> 02:17.159
Yes. These are sweatshop eggs.

02:24.680 --> 02:27.877
I gotta call the office, honey.
Will you order for me?

02:28.440 --> 02:30.271
I'm a honey.

02:30.680 --> 02:32.079
He's pretty great, huh?

02:32.240 --> 02:34.390
Is he from the future?

02:36.160 --> 02:39.835
No, he just shaves his head.
I think it's pretty gutsy.

02:41.280 --> 02:44.078
Sweetheart, let me tell you
a little something about guts.

02:44.240 --> 02:46.515
This is guts.

02:48.160 --> 02:51.311
What? Clinging to some scraps?

02:52.720 --> 02:54.312
These are not scraps.

02:54.480 --> 02:58.951
These are historic remains
of a once-great society of hair.

02:59.560 --> 03:01.278
Did you guys stop
at the bodega today?

03:01.440 --> 03:05.513
Some moron bounced
a clown cheque.

03:11.840 --> 03:13.796
I'm sorry about the cheque,
Marcelino.

03:14.240 --> 03:16.629
People seem to like the clowns.

03:17.600 --> 03:20.990
Look, let me just give you the 40,
plus another 20 for your trouble.

03:21.160 --> 03:22.639
Okay.

03:26.520 --> 03:30.559
- Are you gonna take the cheque down?
- Sorry, no. Store policy.

03:30.720 --> 03:34.395
- But it's your bodega.
- Even I am not above the policy.

03:37.720 --> 03:40.712
- And those are our tennis courts.
- Tennis courts?

03:40.880 --> 03:44.156
What about the yard?
Where do they have the gang fights?

03:44.320 --> 03:48.393
There's no fights here, Mr. Costanza.
This is a minimum-security facility.

03:48.960 --> 03:50.916
What about a hole?

03:51.080 --> 03:54.436
- Do you ever put anybody in the box?
- No.

03:55.120 --> 03:56.792
This prison stinks.

03:57.440 --> 03:59.954
And finally the library,
which has been refurbished...

04:00.120 --> 04:01.792
...thanks to your generous donation.

04:01.960 --> 04:04.679
- This is Celia Morgan, our librarian.
- Nice to meet you.

04:04.840 --> 04:07.274
- I'll be in my office if you need me.
- Thanks, warden.

04:07.440 --> 04:08.793
Betsy.

04:10.280 --> 04:11.838
Betsy.

04:14.440 --> 04:16.031
Are you the head of the foundation?

04:16.200 --> 04:19.555
Well, let's just say
it wouldn't exist without me.

04:21.760 --> 04:24.832
So you two shop at the same store?

04:25.000 --> 04:26.911
No, it's standard issue.

04:27.440 --> 04:30.273
Oh, my God. You're in jail?

04:31.480 --> 04:33.914
That is so cool.

04:37.680 --> 04:39.193
You asked her out?

04:39.360 --> 04:44.036
Well, not out. She's a prisoner.

04:45.400 --> 04:48.153
- How could you ask her out?
- Why not?

04:48.320 --> 04:50.231
You wouldn't date
that girl from Queens...

04:50.400 --> 04:52.436
...because you didn't wanna
cross the bridge.

04:52.600 --> 04:54.431
- It was different.
- I'll say.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.591
Jerry, I like being with her.

04:56.760 --> 04:59.832
Plus, I know where she is
all the time.

05:01.120 --> 05:03.031
I have relatively no competition.

05:03.920 --> 05:06.036
You know how you live in fear
of the pop-in?

05:06.200 --> 05:07.474
- The pop-in.
- No pop-in...

05:07.640 --> 05:10.712
...no, "In the neighbourhood."
No, "I saw your light was on."

05:10.880 --> 05:13.269
And the best part is,
if things go really well...

05:13.440 --> 05:16.113
- Conjugal visit?
- Don't jinx it. Don't.

05:17.200 --> 05:18.838
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

05:19.000 --> 05:20.877
George is dating a convict.

05:21.040 --> 05:22.871
- What's she in for?
- Embezzlement.

05:23.040 --> 05:25.076
Sounds like a nice girl.

05:25.360 --> 05:28.272
Is it all right if I put some stuff
in your fridge? Mine's full.

05:28.440 --> 05:30.715
Yeah, sure.
You don't even have a fridge, do you?

05:30.880 --> 05:32.438
Well, not here.

05:34.320 --> 05:35.912
- Okay.
- Kramer...

05:36.080 --> 05:38.071
Wait a minute. Wait.
What the hell is that?

05:38.240 --> 05:39.992
Well, it's chicken feed.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.116
I sense something is afoot.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.277
Yeah, I bought a chicken.

05:49.280 --> 05:50.759
Allow me.

05:51.680 --> 05:52.908
Why?

05:53.760 --> 05:56.194
Cage-free, farm-fresh eggs.

05:56.560 --> 05:58.357
Allow me.

05:58.520 --> 06:00.636
- What are you? An idiot?
- No.

06:01.760 --> 06:03.716
Hold it. Hold it.
Here. I got it. Catch.

06:07.840 --> 06:09.671
Hey, driver's license.

06:11.400 --> 06:13.994
Oh, my God.

06:14.160 --> 06:17.197
- What?
- Your hair.

06:17.360 --> 06:19.669
It's so thick and lustrous.

06:21.080 --> 06:22.877
I mean, it was.

06:23.040 --> 06:24.314
Well, it still is.

06:24.480 --> 06:26.471
I shaved my head for my swim team.

06:26.640 --> 06:29.108
I just liked the way it looked,
so I kept it.

06:29.280 --> 06:32.716
Are you saying
that I could be dating this hair?

06:33.040 --> 06:35.349
I mean, with you under it?

06:37.000 --> 06:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:51.800 --> 06:52.994
Hey.

06:53.160 --> 06:55.310
Is that your chicken
making all that noise?

06:55.480 --> 06:57.710
Oh, Jerry loves the morning.

06:58.480 --> 07:00.789
- Who?
- Little Jerry Seinfeld.

07:02.480 --> 07:05.119
- I named my chicken after you.
- Thanks. That's very sweet.

07:05.280 --> 07:06.918
But that is not a chicken.

07:07.080 --> 07:09.878
Of course it is.
I picked it out myself.

07:10.040 --> 07:11.678
Well, you picked out a rooster.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.990
Well, that would explain
Little Jerry's poor egg production.

07:24.600 --> 07:27.273
- This was fun.
- Yeah, I had a great time.

07:27.440 --> 07:29.032
Five minutes, Mr. Costanza.

07:29.200 --> 07:31.555
The whole hour just flew by.

07:31.720 --> 07:34.792
- I'll get that.
- Thanks, Bobby.

07:35.400 --> 07:38.073
Well, I guess
I'll see you in four days.

07:38.240 --> 07:40.310
Yeah. Go out
and have a ball with the guys.

07:40.480 --> 07:42.436
I'll be waiting right here for you.

07:42.600 --> 07:44.716
Of course you will.

07:44.880 --> 07:46.279
You're the best.

07:49.680 --> 07:51.591
- Hello.
- Jerry...

07:51.760 --> 07:53.671
...Leo told us
he saw your bounced cheque.

07:53.840 --> 07:57.230
- Are you having money problems?
- I'm not having money problems.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.311
Enough with the comedy.
You're very clever.

07:59.480 --> 08:01.152
You should look into advertising.

08:01.320 --> 08:04.676
He never even called Ed Roydlick.
They were looking for someone.

08:04.840 --> 08:07.400
I'm not calling Ed Roydlick.
I'm doing fine.

08:07.560 --> 08:10.074
That's it. I'm gonna send you $50.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.992
You are not sending me $50.

08:12.160 --> 08:14.628
We're sending you $50.
Morty, get me an envelope.

08:14.800 --> 08:18.952
I swear to God, if you send me $50,
you are gonna be so sorry.

08:19.120 --> 08:21.793
- I don't see envelopes.
- They're right in front of you.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.554
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
Let me show you.

08:24.720 --> 08:28.474
Ma, Ma, Ma!

08:31.320 --> 08:34.073
- How are the folks?
- Good.

08:34.240 --> 08:37.277
- So movie tonight?
- I thought you were going with Celia.

08:37.440 --> 08:38.873
I did. I'm back.

08:39.039 --> 08:41.508
I love this relationship.
I feel so liberated.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.832
Having her in jail?

08:44.000 --> 08:47.356
Yeah, the only thing that bothers me
is I'm just coming up with this now.

08:48.480 --> 08:51.916
Yeah, dating a convicted felon.
I don't know how you missed it.

08:52.440 --> 08:54.954
Here. Take a look at that.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.194
Kurt's an organ donor.

08:58.040 --> 09:00.315
No, he's not bald.

09:00.480 --> 09:02.357
Look, he's got a full head of hair.

09:02.520 --> 09:04.636
So he just shaves his head
for no reason?

09:04.800 --> 09:07.439
That's like using a wheelchair
for the fun of it.

09:08.560 --> 09:10.471
And he's growing it in just for me.

09:10.640 --> 09:13.473
It's mine. It's all mine.

09:13.640 --> 09:17.599
- It's just hair.
- No, it's not just hair. Look.

09:17.760 --> 09:22.880
- It's brown.
- It's chestnut with auburn highlights.

09:23.200 --> 09:25.589
- So?
- You know, you're not around women.

09:25.760 --> 09:30.072
You don't know how important
a man's hair is.

09:34.720 --> 09:36.790
I'm sorry, George, but it's true.

09:36.960 --> 09:38.552
I knew it.

09:44.080 --> 09:45.069
Hey.

09:45.560 --> 09:48.632
- Hey, Kramer, nice rooster.
- Yeah.

09:48.800 --> 09:51.314
- What's his name?
- Well, this is Little Jerry Seinfeld.

09:51.480 --> 09:56.190
Little Jerry Seinfeld.
Does he bounce cheques?

09:56.840 --> 09:58.751
Look, can't you take
Jerry's cheque down?

09:58.920 --> 10:00.194
Sorry, Kramer, can't help.

10:01.280 --> 10:03.350
Hey, hey, Jerry. Come on.

10:03.520 --> 10:04.794
Oh, sorry.

10:04.960 --> 10:08.396
- I like the way he handles himself.
- Oh, yeah.

10:15.680 --> 10:18.831
- Oh, it's coming in already.
- Yeah.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.551
Wow, you have some
very nice little seedlings here.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.073
- What?
- Well, it doesn't seem...

10:28.240 --> 10:33.268
...to be coming in
so good over here or here.

10:34.080 --> 10:37.595
- What do you mean?
- Well, I don't know.

10:37.760 --> 10:39.910
How long have you been shaving
your head for?

10:40.080 --> 10:41.798
About three years.

10:43.200 --> 10:44.679
Oh, my God.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.113
I'm going bald.

10:49.880 --> 10:52.474
George, I'm so glad to see you.

10:52.640 --> 10:54.756
Hey, I brought you some cigarettes.

10:54.920 --> 10:56.876
You buy
yourself something nice.

10:57.040 --> 10:59.679
Good news. I'm up for parole.

11:02.720 --> 11:07.157
Parole? That's dynamite.

11:09.120 --> 11:10.712
Marcelino's taking down the cheque?

11:10.880 --> 11:14.236
Yeah, well, it comes down if Little
Jerry Seinfeld wins the cockfight.

11:14.400 --> 11:15.674
Great.

11:16.280 --> 11:17.508
What?

11:17.680 --> 11:20.797
Well, Marcelino, he has cockfights
in the back of his store.

11:20.960 --> 11:23.269
Yeah, so he says
if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins...

11:23.440 --> 11:25.078
...the cheque comes down.

11:25.240 --> 11:26.753
Kramer, cockfighting is illegal.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.717
Only in the United States.

11:28.880 --> 11:31.440
- It's inhumane.
- Jerry, it's not what you think it is.

11:31.600 --> 11:33.989
It's two roosters pecking
at each other.

11:35.040 --> 11:36.393
- What?
- Yeah.

11:37.440 --> 11:40.352
Well, I thought
they wore gloves and helmets.

11:40.520 --> 11:42.875
You know,
like American Gladiators.

11:43.040 --> 11:45.110
No, Kramer,
Little Jerry could get hurt.

11:45.280 --> 11:46.679
I left him with Marcelino.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.437
My Little Jerry.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.911
Hey, did you get Little Jerry?
Is he okay?

11:58.080 --> 12:00.548
Oh, well, he's more than okay.
He won.

12:01.280 --> 12:03.748
- You let him fight?
- I couldn't get there in time.

12:03.920 --> 12:05.876
But you should've seen
Little Jerry, Jerry.

12:06.040 --> 12:09.077
Flapping his wings
and strutting his stuff.

12:09.240 --> 12:13.518
He was pecking and weaving
and bobbing and talking trash.

12:13.680 --> 12:16.990
He didn't even have to touch him.
The other rooster ran out of the ring.

12:18.200 --> 12:19.952
The whole fight lasted two seconds.

12:20.120 --> 12:22.588
- How long do they usually last?
- Five seconds.

12:22.760 --> 12:25.035
Marcelino says he's taking
your cheque down today.

12:25.200 --> 12:27.350
- Great.
- Hey.

12:27.520 --> 12:30.398
- Celia is up for parole.
- Hey, Little Jerry won his cockfight.

12:30.560 --> 12:32.869
- What?
- Who?

12:34.200 --> 12:35.758
I'm too tired.

12:36.200 --> 12:38.395
Listen. I want you to come by later,
all right?

12:38.560 --> 12:40.312
- We're having a victory party.
- Okay.

12:42.760 --> 12:45.752
It's over, Jerry. She's getting out.

12:45.920 --> 12:47.353
I'm so sorry.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.152
She's been locked up for two years.

12:50.320 --> 12:53.118
She's gonna want to make up
for lost time.

12:53.280 --> 12:56.750
Dinners, movies, talking.

12:58.200 --> 12:59.918
In other words,
a normal relationship.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.391
That's no good.

13:03.600 --> 13:06.876
I've tried it straight, Jerry.
We've all seen the results.

13:07.040 --> 13:08.473
I think for me...

13:09.280 --> 13:11.635
...sick is the only way to go.

13:11.800 --> 13:13.756
Well, she'll still be an ex-con.

13:13.920 --> 13:15.672
It's not the same.

13:15.840 --> 13:18.434
Hey, if you two
were meant to be together...

13:18.600 --> 13:20.909
...l'm sure the cops
will pick her up on something.

13:24.360 --> 13:25.918
Kurt?

13:27.520 --> 13:30.796
What's with the sweats?
Aren't we going out?

13:30.960 --> 13:32.951
I don't care.

13:34.440 --> 13:37.557
You got a big stain on your shirt.

13:37.720 --> 13:40.314
Oh, yeah, a meatball
fell out of my sandwich.

13:40.480 --> 13:42.038
You already ate?

13:42.200 --> 13:43.997
It's from yesterday.

13:47.680 --> 13:50.240
Jerry, you missed a hell
of a cockfight last night.

13:50.400 --> 13:53.073
Then what is my cheque still doing up?
We had a deal.

13:53.240 --> 13:55.390
- Now we have a new deal.
- New deal?

13:55.560 --> 13:59.189
When Little Jerry Seinfeld is mine,
the cheque will be yours.

13:59.360 --> 14:01.351
This is outrageous.

14:01.520 --> 14:02.714
Pack of Juicy Fruit.

14:03.840 --> 14:05.910
- Eighty-five cents.
- Eighty-five cents?

14:06.160 --> 14:08.116
That is outrageous.

14:10.120 --> 14:12.839
Marcelino wants us
to sell him Little Jerry Seinfeld.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.433
That's out of the question.

14:14.600 --> 14:17.068
But cockfighting is
an illegal and immoral activity.

14:17.240 --> 14:21.870
Yeah, if you've got a loser.
But Little Jerry was born to cockfight.

14:22.040 --> 14:23.473
No, no more cockfighting.

14:23.640 --> 14:26.438
Let's just sell him to Marcelino
and be done with it.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.158
- I think you're jealous.
- Of what?

14:30.040 --> 14:34.397
Yeah, you see in Little Jerry Seinfeld
the unlimited future you once had.

14:34.560 --> 14:37.233
Now, just because
Jerry Seinfeld is a has-been...

14:37.400 --> 14:39.789
...don't make
Little Jerry Seinfeld a never-was.

14:39.960 --> 14:41.837
- Kramer, give me that rooster.
- Never!

14:42.000 --> 14:45.436
You hate him because he's doing more
with your name than you ever will!

14:50.080 --> 14:53.595
George, Celia has listed you
as a character reference.

14:53.760 --> 14:58.038
Whatever you can tell us would be
helpful in her getting parole.

14:59.520 --> 15:02.080
Well, anything I could do to help.

15:02.240 --> 15:07.189
She's a wonderful girl.
Very smart, very crafty.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.910
Does she have any plans
after she's released?

15:10.080 --> 15:11.911
Plans. Schemes.

15:12.080 --> 15:15.197
She keeps talking about getting
back together with her old friends.

15:15.360 --> 15:18.158
You know, "the gang,"
she likes to call them.

15:18.320 --> 15:21.596
Yeah, they're hatching something.
You can count on that.

15:24.840 --> 15:28.799
Jerry, tomorrow night is fight night.
Where's my rooster?

15:28.960 --> 15:31.155
- Kramer won't sell.
- Tell you what I'm gonna do.

15:31.320 --> 15:33.072
I'm gonna take down
your cheque anyway.

15:33.240 --> 15:34.514
Well, thank you, Marcelino.

15:34.680 --> 15:37.433
Well, perhaps some day
you will do me a favour.

15:37.600 --> 15:38.828
And that day is today.

15:40.280 --> 15:41.998
Little Jerry Seinfeld must go down...

15:42.160 --> 15:44.390
...in the third round
of tomorrow's main event.

15:44.560 --> 15:47.199
- You want Little Jerry to take a dive?
- Not so loud.

15:47.360 --> 15:50.238
First of all, I don't think
you can make a rooster take a dive.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.470
- Can too.
- Second of all...

15:52.640 --> 15:54.232
...Jerry Seinfeld, big or little...

15:54.400 --> 15:56.789
...doesn't go down for anyone,
anywhere, at any time.

15:56.960 --> 15:59.030
Now, I'd appreciate it
if you'd please leave.

15:59.200 --> 16:02.590
Big Jerry is making
a big mistake, Jerry.

16:02.760 --> 16:04.591
We'll see about that.

16:07.920 --> 16:10.195
Kramer, I'm coming up.
We got a cockfight to win.

16:10.360 --> 16:11.634
Okay.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.754
Elaine said you would be
the best person I could talk to.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.834
Yeah, classic horseshoe pattern.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.911
- I've seen a lot of this.
- Oh, God.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.150
No, no, Kurt, wrong attitude.

16:24.320 --> 16:26.595
- You should be happy.
- Why should I be happy?

16:26.760 --> 16:28.671
You've still got
pretty good coverage.

16:28.840 --> 16:32.719
Once the enemy advances
beyond this perimeter...

16:34.120 --> 16:35.838
...then you won't be Kurt anymore.

16:36.560 --> 16:37.549
What will I be?

16:43.200 --> 16:48.035
- How long do I have?
- Fourteen months, maybe 10.

16:48.200 --> 16:50.760
- Is there anything I can do?
- Yes...

16:51.520 --> 16:52.714
...live, damn it.

16:52.880 --> 16:57.749
Live every precious moment as
if this was the last year of your life...

16:57.920 --> 16:59.512
...because in many ways...

17:00.520 --> 17:01.589
...it is.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.279
Excuse me.

17:09.119 --> 17:11.111
Celia, what are you doing here?

17:11.280 --> 17:13.748
Well, I didn't get my parole,
so I busted out.

17:13.920 --> 17:15.955
And you just decided to pop in?

17:23.400 --> 17:26.198
- Kurt.
- Elaine, will you marry me?

17:28.319 --> 17:30.436
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

17:32.080 --> 17:33.911
- He's looking good, huh, Jerry?
- Yeah.

17:34.480 --> 17:36.516
All right.
I think that's enough for today.

17:39.840 --> 17:42.513
Little Jerry is a lean, mean,
pecking machine.

17:43.560 --> 17:46.597
- What are you doing with that?
- I'm just gonna heat this up.

17:46.760 --> 17:48.796
Make a little hot tub for Little Jerry.

17:49.440 --> 17:51.078
Hey, Kramer...

17:51.760 --> 17:53.273
...be careful.
- Yeah.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.354
- Hey.
- Hey, guess what.

17:55.520 --> 17:58.557
Little Jerry ran from here
to Newman's in under 30 seconds.

17:58.720 --> 18:01.075
- Is that good?
- I don't know.

18:02.080 --> 18:04.640
- Where have you been?
- Celia broke out of prison.

18:05.360 --> 18:07.351
I'm at home,
she shows up at the door.

18:07.520 --> 18:11.069
- Oh, my God, the break out pop-in.
- Yeah.

18:11.240 --> 18:12.468
And, Jerry, listen to this.

18:12.640 --> 18:15.393
I've discovered something better
than conjugal-visit sex.

18:15.560 --> 18:17.596
Fugitive sex.

18:17.760 --> 18:19.432
- It's like every time...
- George.

18:19.600 --> 18:22.433
This is a little too much.
Escape convicts, fugitive sex...

18:22.600 --> 18:24.033
I got a cockfight to focus on.

18:29.360 --> 18:31.669
Hey, hey, Kurt, slow down.

18:31.840 --> 18:34.229
I can't just marry you.

18:34.400 --> 18:37.119
I mean, I need some fiancée time.

18:37.280 --> 18:40.352
I need some
make-my-girlfriends-jealous time.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.078
Plus, you want to get to know me.

18:42.240 --> 18:45.118
Yeah, yeah, that too.

18:45.280 --> 18:48.716
- Well, how much time?
- I don't know. A year?

18:48.880 --> 18:50.438
No, no, no, it has to be now.

18:52.480 --> 18:54.869
Could I see the ring again?

18:59.640 --> 19:01.232
So you're actually considering it?

19:01.400 --> 19:04.551
Well, it will be a couple of years
before he's completely bald.

19:04.720 --> 19:06.119
Those will be good times.

19:06.280 --> 19:09.113
Marriage is a big step, Elaine.
Your life will totally change.

19:09.280 --> 19:12.113
Jerry, it's 3:30 in the morning.
I'm at a cockfight.

19:12.280 --> 19:13.872
What am I clinging to?

19:16.160 --> 19:17.149
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:17.320 --> 19:18.878
- Sorry I'm late.
- Where's Celia?

19:19.040 --> 19:22.237
She didn't wanna come.
She's not really into sports.

19:22.520 --> 19:25.353
- Hey, how's he doing?
- Well, he's got a big sweat going.

19:25.520 --> 19:28.990
Oh, this came for you Express Mail.
It's from your parents.

19:29.160 --> 19:30.275
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:30.960 --> 19:33.918
"Fifty dollars."
I don't believe this.

19:34.520 --> 19:36.511
There's Marcelino.

19:37.600 --> 19:40.160
Look at the size of his bird.

19:40.320 --> 19:43.676
That looks like a dog
with a glove on his head.

19:47.160 --> 19:48.912
Hi, is George back
from the cockfight?

19:49.080 --> 19:51.116
I've got to thank him.
He changed my life.

19:51.280 --> 19:53.111
Must've been a good fight.
He's not back.

19:53.280 --> 19:54.269
Damn.

19:54.680 --> 19:56.875
Sorry to bother you, Mr. Costanza.

19:57.040 --> 19:59.110
Well, well, well, look who's here.

19:59.280 --> 20:00.474
Oh, man.

20:00.640 --> 20:02.312
Mr. Costanza, you're under arrest...

20:02.480 --> 20:04.755
...for aiding and abetting
a known fugitive.

20:04.920 --> 20:07.036
- I'm not George Costanza.
- Save it.

20:07.200 --> 20:10.829
We know you're bald.
We know it's you. Let's go.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.193
Okay. I got the whole scoop.

20:15.360 --> 20:17.669
Marcelino flew the bird in
from Ecuador.

20:17.840 --> 20:20.274
- He's 68-0.
- He's a ringer.

20:20.440 --> 20:21.873
Where's the tamale guy?

20:24.200 --> 20:26.270
Little Jerry's gonna get
his clock cleaned.

20:26.440 --> 20:28.476
I've gotta get him out of there.

20:30.680 --> 20:33.274
Little Jerry!

20:33.440 --> 20:36.352
Kramer!

20:37.600 --> 20:42.071
Stop the fight!

20:43.160 --> 20:46.357
Tamale!

21:07.040 --> 21:09.110
Why did you get into
a fistfight with the cop?

21:09.280 --> 21:11.555
- You were innocent.
- They thought I was George.

21:11.720 --> 21:13.631
I'm not that bald.

21:13.800 --> 21:17.349
And I have too little time left
to take that crap, so I slugged him.

21:17.800 --> 21:19.756
How long are you
gonna be in here for?

21:19.920 --> 21:24.357
Well, my lawyer says 14 months,
but with good behaviour maybe 10.

21:26.440 --> 21:29.671
- So 10 to 14 months?
- Yeah.
