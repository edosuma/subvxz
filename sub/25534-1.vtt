00:03.840 --> 00:05.638
<i>I still think
about the night</i>

00:05.720 --> 00:07.473
<i>your mother and I
had to leave you.</i>

00:12.440 --> 00:14.318
Hopefully,
it's not for long,

00:14.400 --> 00:16.312
but I'll call you
when we get settled.

00:16.480 --> 00:18.456
When I have a better
indication of what's going on.

00:18.480 --> 00:19.480
Mommy?

00:22.480 --> 00:24.073
Jellybean.

00:26.040 --> 00:28.635
Daddy and I have
a last-minute business trip...

00:28.840 --> 00:31.071
so Rose is gonna stay with you
for a few days.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.357
No. I don't want you to go.

00:33.760 --> 00:36.559
Ugh. It's gonna be so boring.

00:36.760 --> 00:38.240
I won't be able to keep my...

00:38.720 --> 00:39.836
eyes...

00:43.200 --> 00:46.079
Goodbye, sweetheart.
All right, we'll see you soon.

00:46.840 --> 00:47.840
Okay.

00:48.240 --> 00:49.390
Janet, we gotta go.

00:52.480 --> 00:54.756
<i>I wish we could have
put down our bags...</i>

00:54.920 --> 00:56.991
<i>tucked you back
into your bed...</i>

00:57.440 --> 01:00.433
<i>but too many lives
were at stake.</i>

01:04.239 --> 01:05.640
Oh, my God.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.439
They've already launched.

01:07.600 --> 01:08.716
We have to stop it.

01:08.920 --> 01:09.920
Come on.

01:18.720 --> 01:21.872
<i>To disarm the missile,
we had to get inside it...</i>

01:22.040 --> 01:24.839
<i>but the plating was too thick.</i>

01:25.000 --> 01:27.913
<i>The only way in was to shrink
between the molecules.</i>

01:31.360 --> 01:32.840
I can't get through.

01:34.120 --> 01:35.156
Hank.

01:35.920 --> 01:39.357
<i>We both knew
that if you go that small...</i>

01:39.520 --> 01:40.590
<i>there is no coming back.</i>

01:41.880 --> 01:45.669
<i>It should have been me,
but my regulator was damaged.</i>

01:46.680 --> 01:48.831
<i>Your mother's wasn't.</i>

01:50.040 --> 01:51.997
Tell Hope I love her.

01:52.440 --> 01:53.440
<i>She turned it off.</i>

01:53.840 --> 01:54.956
Janet. No!

01:55.520 --> 01:57.512
<i>She went subatomic
to deactivate the bomb.</i>

02:02.600 --> 02:06.389
<i>Your mother saved
thousands of lives that day</i>

02:06.600 --> 02:10.037
<i>knowing she'd be lost
in the quantum realm.</i>

02:11.280 --> 02:12.280
<i>Alone.</i>

02:12.800 --> 02:13.800
<i>Afraid.</i>

02:14.720 --> 02:16.439
<i>Gone forever.</i>

02:31.520 --> 02:34.160
<i>Telling you that she wasn't
coming home...</i>

02:34.920 --> 02:37.594
<i>was the hardest thing
that I ever had to do.</i>

02:41.800 --> 02:43.234
But then Scott showed up.

02:43.920 --> 02:46.879
Or should I say,
broke into our house.

02:48.040 --> 02:49.918
<i>And when he went
to the quantum realm...</i>

02:53.560 --> 02:54.596
<i>and came back.</i>

02:55.480 --> 02:56.994
<i>Everything changed.</i>

02:59.000 --> 03:00.878
I started to wonder...

03:01.440 --> 03:03.636
could your mother
still be alive?

03:05.360 --> 03:08.273
So, I dusted off
some old plans.

03:17.960 --> 03:19.997
Dad, what are you saying?

03:21.000 --> 03:24.676
I think it's possible
to bring her back.

04:03.720 --> 04:05.677
Okay. We're in.

04:08.840 --> 04:10.957
Oh, this place is a maze.

04:11.120 --> 04:12.998
Where's that map?

04:16.040 --> 04:17.599
We're definitely close.

04:17.760 --> 04:19.558
- You ready?
- I'm ready, Daddy.

04:19.720 --> 04:21.439
Are you sure?
'Cause once we're inside,

04:21.519 --> 04:23.716
you show any hesitation
or fear, we're done.

04:23.880 --> 04:25.837
I eat fear for breakfast.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.469
Wow. That is super cool.

04:28.640 --> 04:29.710
Come on.

04:34.040 --> 04:37.158
Look! It's Anton.
He'll show us the way.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.198
Anton, which way do we go?

04:42.040 --> 04:43.872
Anton, which way do we go?

04:51.840 --> 04:52.990
Thanks, Anton!

04:54.760 --> 04:57.639
Look, the ants have burrowed
into the tech facility.

04:57.800 --> 04:59.519
Oh no, lasers!

05:01.560 --> 05:03.677
Oh! I think I got lased!

05:05.960 --> 05:08.156
The secret vault.

05:09.160 --> 05:11.117
Tell me you brought
the contact lens.

05:11.280 --> 05:12.919
Yup.

05:14.520 --> 05:16.989
Perfect! Right there.

05:21.040 --> 05:23.350
There!
It's the micro-treasure!

05:23.520 --> 05:25.159
My trophy?

05:25.720 --> 05:26.836
It looks like treasure.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.275
Oh, it is to me.

05:28.440 --> 05:29.840
I want to take it
to show-and-tell.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.040
Oh, no, you can't do that.

05:31.200 --> 05:34.318
You can't. It never leaves
the house. It's too important.

05:34.520 --> 05:36.557
This is the best birthday
present you ever got me.

05:36.720 --> 05:37.720
I'm so touched you think

05:37.800 --> 05:39.632
I'm the world's
greatest grandma.

05:39.800 --> 05:41.120
It was the only one they had.

05:41.280 --> 05:42.999
It makes me want
to knit you a sweater.

05:45.320 --> 05:46.470
Oh, no, the fuzz!

05:46.640 --> 05:47.471
Hey, Scotty...

05:47.640 --> 05:48.736
I was looking
at the schematics

05:48.760 --> 05:50.194
for the
Karapetyan buildings...

05:50.360 --> 05:51.430
and I think we have

05:51.520 --> 05:52.936
way too many security cameras,
don't we?

05:52.960 --> 05:54.189
No, no, not at all.

05:54.360 --> 05:55.896
I mean, 'cause it's a lot of
security cameras.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.070
I know what he needs.

05:57.160 --> 05:58.958
Who's the security expert
in our business?

05:59.120 --> 05:59.917
You are, but I'm running
the company, right?

06:00.000 --> 06:01.040
And if we overquote him...

06:01.120 --> 06:02.176
he's gonna go somewhere else.

06:02.200 --> 06:02.917
I mean,
we gotta land this bird.

06:03.080 --> 06:04.275
He ain't goin' anywhere.

06:04.360 --> 06:05.656
And the expression is
"land this fish."

06:05.680 --> 06:07.114
No, it's "land the bird."

06:07.280 --> 06:08.416
Just like you land the plane.

06:08.440 --> 06:09.696
You gotta land the plane
to be in business.

06:09.720 --> 06:10.995
I know it's silly
to get hung up

06:11.080 --> 06:12.594
on these kinds of things,
but I do.

06:12.760 --> 06:13.910
How am I gonna land a fish?

06:14.080 --> 06:15.958
It can't walk.
And if it swam up on shore...

06:16.080 --> 06:18.276
and it battled a hawk,
who's gonna win?

06:18.880 --> 06:21.475
You've really turned me around
on this thing.

06:21.640 --> 06:23.552
It's okay.
We're gonna land Karapetyan.

06:23.720 --> 06:24.949
Now, if you just excuse me...

06:25.120 --> 06:25.712
I'm in the middle of trying to

06:25.800 --> 06:26.472
steal something
with my daughter.

06:26.640 --> 06:27.676
I'm gonna go recheck it.

06:27.960 --> 06:30.395
To the escape ant!

06:31.480 --> 06:34.314
Let's bounce
before the po-po come back!

06:34.480 --> 06:37.393
The po-po?
How do you even know that?

06:37.560 --> 06:39.552
Let's fly, Antoinette!
Let's fly!

06:50.680 --> 06:51.796
Crash landing!

06:52.160 --> 06:53.480
Whoo!

06:55.800 --> 06:57.234
I wish we could shrink
for real.

06:57.360 --> 06:58.919
Oh. That is pretty cool.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.000
Hey, I'm headed
to the office, Scotty.

07:01.280 --> 07:02.536
And sorry about freaking out
earlier, you know.

07:02.560 --> 07:03.760
But I feel
like I'm way better.

07:03.880 --> 07:06.000
My heart is definitely beating
way too hard and stuff.

07:06.160 --> 07:07.196
And my hands are shaking.

07:07.320 --> 07:08.696
But I think it's unrelated,
you know?

07:08.720 --> 07:09.836
It's gonna be great, Luis!

07:09.920 --> 07:11.120
You got nothing
to worry about!

07:11.240 --> 07:13.709
Yeah, yeah. I'm the boss.
I'm the boss.

07:13.880 --> 07:15.176
I'm the boss.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:15.200 --> 07:16.634
Daddy!

07:22.200 --> 07:24.840
Come on, Woo!
I've got three days left.

07:24.920 --> 07:26.115
Why would I try to escape?

07:26.280 --> 07:27.999
Sorry, Scott,
but rules are rules.

07:28.160 --> 07:29.816
You trip the perimeter alarm,
we search the place.

07:29.840 --> 07:31.479
Keel to stern, soup to nuts.

07:31.720 --> 07:33.234
Thank you.

07:33.400 --> 07:35.471
It was an accident. My foot
went through the fence.

07:35.680 --> 07:36.955
Our flying ant crashed.

07:37.840 --> 07:39.376
Hey, you try and entertain
a 10-year-old

07:39.400 --> 07:40.600
when you can't leave
the house.

07:40.640 --> 07:42.871
You know the lengths
that I've gone to?

07:44.080 --> 07:45.719
Close-up magic.

07:48.640 --> 07:49.790
I learned that.

07:50.480 --> 07:52.358
Why can't you just leave
my daddy alone?

07:53.800 --> 07:55.519
Oh, Cassie.

07:55.680 --> 07:57.876
This must all seem like
a bunch of confusing

07:57.960 --> 07:59.474
grown-up stuff to you, huh?

07:59.640 --> 08:01.313
Well, think of it this way.

08:01.480 --> 08:03.199
Your school has rules, right?

08:03.280 --> 08:05.192
Like, you can't draw
on the walls.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.272
Well, your daddy
went to Germany

08:07.360 --> 08:09.317
and drew on the walls
with Captain America.

08:09.480 --> 08:11.836
And that was a violation
of Article 16,

08:11.920 --> 08:14.037
Paragraph Three
of the Sokovia Accords.

08:14.200 --> 08:15.953
Now, as a part of
his joint plea deal...

08:16.120 --> 08:18.351
with Homeland Security
and the German government...

08:18.560 --> 08:20.233
he was allowed to return
to the U.S...

08:20.400 --> 08:22.710
provided he serve two years
under house arrest...

08:22.880 --> 08:24.599
followed by three years
of probation.

08:24.760 --> 08:27.559
And avoid any unauthorized
activities, technology...

08:27.720 --> 08:29.837
or contact with any
former associates who were...

08:30.000 --> 08:33.232
or currently are
in violation of said Accords.

08:33.400 --> 08:34.799
Or any related statutes.

08:34.960 --> 08:36.235
Okay, sweetie?

08:37.320 --> 08:39.710
Wow. You're really great
with kids.

08:39.880 --> 08:41.758
Thanks.
I'm also a youth pastor.

08:42.360 --> 08:44.511
Anyway, not to be
a Johnny ask-a-lot...

08:44.680 --> 08:46.000
but you haven't had
any contact

08:46.080 --> 08:47.719
with Hank Pym
or Hope Van Dyne, have you?

08:47.920 --> 08:49.354
- No.
- You sure?

08:49.520 --> 08:51.536
Because it's only a matter
of time before we get 'em.

08:51.560 --> 08:54.075
It was their tech, so they
violated the Accords, too.

08:54.240 --> 08:57.074
And associating with them
breaks your deal.

08:57.240 --> 08:59.357
And, uh, I don't need
to remind you...

08:59.520 --> 09:01.239
that any violation
of your agreement

09:01.320 --> 09:03.039
means 20 years in prison.
Minimum.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.669
I haven't talked to Hank
or Hope in forever.

09:05.840 --> 09:06.956
They hate his guts.

09:07.120 --> 09:08.120
Thanks, peanut.

09:09.640 --> 09:10.960
How'd you do it, Scott?

09:11.680 --> 09:12.716
Do what?

09:13.920 --> 09:15.832
The card trick.

09:16.320 --> 09:17.470
Seriously?

09:17.880 --> 09:19.633
Oh, my God!

09:19.800 --> 09:22.110
You people
can't just show up here

09:22.200 --> 09:23.759
whenever you want
and search the place.

09:23.920 --> 09:24.956
Actually, they can.

09:25.120 --> 09:25.871
You need a warrant.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.116
Actually, they don't.

09:27.280 --> 09:28.760
Really? Wow.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.039
Did you pack
your soccer shoes?

09:31.200 --> 09:33.317
- Yeah.
- All right.

09:33.880 --> 09:36.190
Next time I see you will be
on the outside.

09:36.360 --> 09:37.953
All right.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.039
Oh, get on the inside of this.

09:41.320 --> 09:42.834
Hey, three days.
Seriously...

09:43.000 --> 09:44.256
- I'm proud of you, bud.
- Thank you.

09:44.280 --> 09:45.776
You know what?
Give me another one.

09:45.800 --> 09:47.871
Me too!
Gosh! Freedom!

09:48.040 --> 09:50.635
New business!
I am sensing greatness.

09:50.800 --> 09:52.393
I had a fun weekend, Daddy.

09:52.560 --> 09:54.472
Me too, peanut. But just wait
till next weekend.

09:54.640 --> 09:55.640
Once I'm outta here,

09:55.720 --> 09:57.056
you and I are
gonna go paint this town red.

09:57.080 --> 10:00.357
We'll have so much ice cream,
we'll never stop puking.

10:08.080 --> 10:09.230
You're gettin' good at that.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.436
How'd you do that?

10:10.600 --> 10:11.840
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.039
- Bye.
- Bye.

10:18.800 --> 10:20.154
Three days.

10:20.760 --> 10:22.080
Easy-peasy.

10:30.280 --> 10:33.159
<i>Snap your fingers. That gets
them to look over there.</i>

10:33.360 --> 10:35.158
<i>And that is misdirection.</i>

10:38.880 --> 10:40.280
<i>We had a dream</i>

10:40.360 --> 10:41.953
<i>We'd go travelin' together</i>

10:42.160 --> 10:45.198
<i>We'd spread a little lovin'
then we'd keep movin' on</i>

11:14.360 --> 11:17.319
Easy-peasy.

11:24.320 --> 11:25.834
<i>Where are you?</i>

11:34.160 --> 11:36.516
<i>Everything
that you know...</i>

11:40.240 --> 11:41.515
<i>Lost...</i>

11:41.720 --> 11:44.076
<i>in the quantum realm.</i>

11:51.280 --> 11:52.794
<i>What?</i>

11:53.080 --> 11:55.231
I'm gonna find you,
Jellybean.

12:01.040 --> 12:02.394
I found you!

12:02.520 --> 12:04.989
You always find me, Mommy.

12:05.480 --> 12:07.392
<i>What the hell?</i>

12:22.160 --> 12:24.436
Hey, Hank!
It's been a while.

12:25.360 --> 12:29.070
Um, I don't even know if
this is your number anymore.

12:29.240 --> 12:30.594
And I'm probably
the last person

12:30.680 --> 12:32.239
you wanna hear from.

12:33.360 --> 12:35.556
But I just had
a really weird dream.

12:35.720 --> 12:36.836
And I know that doesn't

12:36.920 --> 12:38.216
sound like an emergency
or anything...

12:38.240 --> 12:42.393
but it just felt very real.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.038
I was back
in the quantum realm...

12:46.240 --> 12:49.233
and I think I saw your wife.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.357
And then I was your wife.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.354
I mean, not in a weird way
or anything.

12:56.560 --> 12:58.870
You know,
hearing this out loud,

12:58.960 --> 13:01.316
I'm thinking, uh,
it's not an emergency.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.472
I'm sorry to bother you.

13:04.760 --> 13:07.116
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

13:16.120 --> 13:19.397
<i>That means, one tiny atom
in my fingernail could be...</i>

13:20.560 --> 13:24.793
<i>Could be one,
little, tiny universe.</i>

13:58.720 --> 13:59.720
Hope?

14:01.960 --> 14:03.360
Is this another dream?

14:03.520 --> 14:04.696
Do you think it was a dream...

14:04.720 --> 14:07.315
or is it possible that you
really saw my mom down there?

14:08.000 --> 14:09.480
I'm not sure.

14:12.960 --> 14:14.280
I can't be here!

14:14.360 --> 14:16.079
I can't be here!
I'm under house arrest!

14:16.240 --> 14:19.074
They won't open while
the system's engaged, Scott.

14:38.840 --> 14:41.674
You have to take me home.
They could show up any second!

14:41.840 --> 14:43.016
Relax. As far as your
nanny cops know,

14:43.040 --> 14:44.156
you're still at home.

14:50.960 --> 14:52.314
Whoa!

14:58.160 --> 14:59.160
Scotty?

14:59.320 --> 15:01.296
<i>He's programmed to
replicate your daily routine.</i>

15:01.320 --> 15:02.674
Nine hours in bed.

15:02.880 --> 15:04.080
Five hours in front of the TV.

15:04.160 --> 15:06.277
Two hours in the bathroom,
whatever that's about.

15:06.440 --> 15:07.874
That's totally inaccurate.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.720
And how do you know
about my daily routine?

15:09.760 --> 15:10.796
Are you spying on me?

15:10.960 --> 15:12.776
We keep tabs on all
security threats, all right?

15:12.800 --> 15:14.837
And so far the biggest one
we've had is you.

15:17.880 --> 15:20.270
I'm sorry about Germany.
They just showed up.

15:20.480 --> 15:22.320
They said it was
a matter of national security.

15:22.440 --> 15:23.669
That Cap needed help, so...

15:23.840 --> 15:25.069
Cap?

15:25.960 --> 15:28.953
Tain America.
Captain. Cap.

15:29.120 --> 15:30.918
It's what we call him.

15:31.400 --> 15:32.550
If you're a friend.

15:32.720 --> 15:33.976
I'm not saying I'm a friend
of... A little, I know him.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.036
He's nice. Whatever.

15:35.680 --> 15:38.195
I'm sorry! All right?
I didn't think I'd get caught.

15:38.360 --> 15:39.880
You didn't think
about a lot of things.

15:41.320 --> 15:42.470
How's Hank?

15:42.640 --> 15:44.776
We're still running. The house
is gone, so is our freedom.

15:44.800 --> 15:46.029
How do you think he is?

15:46.200 --> 15:48.032
I'm sorry. I know you're mad.

15:48.200 --> 15:49.680
I'm not looking
for an apology, Scott.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.560
The only reason
why we're even talking is...

15:51.600 --> 15:53.193
because we need
what's in your head.

16:32.040 --> 16:33.952
Is this where you're living?

16:34.600 --> 16:38.355
If you need help or money
or something, maybe I can...

16:38.520 --> 16:39.874
We're fine.

17:37.040 --> 17:39.191
Hey, Hank.
Look, I just wanna...

17:39.760 --> 17:41.194
Save it!

17:44.560 --> 17:45.710
- Can we start?
- Yeah.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.231
So, while you were relaxing
at home...

17:49.400 --> 17:51.756
we were building this.

17:52.720 --> 17:54.757
It's a tunnel.
To the quantum realm.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.029
To my mom.

17:57.200 --> 17:58.376
We think she might still
be down there.

17:58.400 --> 17:59.400
We just don't know where.

17:59.560 --> 18:00.560
What?

18:01.080 --> 18:03.072
If we can pinpoint
my mom's location...

18:03.240 --> 18:05.152
then the pod can take me down
to get her.

18:05.320 --> 18:06.656
You built all this
and you don't even know

18:06.680 --> 18:07.875
if she's alive?

18:08.040 --> 18:09.952
It's called a hypothesis.

18:10.120 --> 18:12.840
Last night, we powered up
the tunnel for the first time.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.117
It was overloaded
and it shut down.

18:15.320 --> 18:16.879
But for a split second,

18:16.960 --> 18:19.919
the doorway to the
quantum realm was opened.

18:20.800 --> 18:21.870
And?

18:22.040 --> 18:25.158
And five minutes later,
you called, talking about Mom.

18:26.080 --> 18:27.136
We think
when you were down there,

18:27.160 --> 18:28.514
you may have entangled
with her.

18:28.680 --> 18:30.720
Hank, I would never do that.
I respect you too much.

18:30.920 --> 18:33.071
Quantum entanglement, Scott.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.475
We think she might have put

18:34.560 --> 18:35.936
some kind of a message
in your head.

18:35.960 --> 18:37.758
Hopefully, a location.

18:37.920 --> 18:39.513
And opening the tunnel
triggered it.

18:39.720 --> 18:41.279
Your mom put a message
in my head?

18:41.360 --> 18:42.999
Come on. That's insane.

18:43.160 --> 18:44.196
No, Scott.

18:44.360 --> 18:46.716
Insane is going to Germany

18:46.800 --> 18:49.156
without telling us,
and fighting the Avengers.

18:49.320 --> 18:52.438
Just tell me you weren't lying
about the suit you took.

18:52.600 --> 18:55.399
Tell me
you really destroyed it.

18:55.560 --> 18:57.756
I did, I destroyed it,
I swear.

18:57.920 --> 18:59.798
I can't believe
you destroyed my suit!

19:00.760 --> 19:02.319
That was my life's work!

19:02.480 --> 19:03.709
What was I supposed to do?

19:03.880 --> 19:06.634
You were supposed to not
take my suit!

19:06.800 --> 19:07.800
I'm sorry, Hank!

19:08.000 --> 19:09.354
I'm sorry I took the suit.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.636
I'm sorry
that I called last night.

19:11.800 --> 19:13.816
I don't remember
seeing Janet down there.

19:13.840 --> 19:15.035
I wish that I did.

19:15.200 --> 19:16.111
I just had a dream about her

19:16.200 --> 19:17.800
playing hide-and-seek
with a little girl.

19:21.200 --> 19:22.200
What?

19:24.840 --> 19:26.274
I had a dream.

19:26.440 --> 19:29.080
She was playing hide-and-seek
with a little girl.

19:29.240 --> 19:31.038
Cassie and I do it
all the time.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.395
Doesn't mean anything.

19:32.560 --> 19:34.517
But was it Cassie
in the dream?

19:34.680 --> 19:35.750
No.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.036
Where was she hiding?

19:37.200 --> 19:38.554
- What?
- The little girl.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.757
Where was she hiding?
Was it in a wardrobe?

19:41.520 --> 19:44.035
No, it was in a tall dresser.

19:44.240 --> 19:45.356
You mean a wardrobe.

19:45.520 --> 19:46.636
Is that what that's called?

19:47.000 --> 19:48.480
What color was it?

19:49.240 --> 19:50.240
Red.

19:52.320 --> 19:53.800
Were there horses on it?

19:54.360 --> 19:55.476
Oh, boy.

19:56.600 --> 19:59.513
It's where I hid
every time that we played.

20:00.080 --> 20:01.196
It doesn't sound like

20:01.280 --> 20:03.317
you really got the gist
of the game.

20:05.080 --> 20:06.514
She's alive.

20:08.280 --> 20:09.919
I knew it.

20:10.840 --> 20:12.194
I knew it!

20:13.760 --> 20:15.114
We need to get that part.

20:15.280 --> 20:16.475
Okay.

20:18.520 --> 20:19.896
The sooner we get
the tunnel working...

20:19.920 --> 20:21.536
the sooner we can get
this message out of his head.

20:21.560 --> 20:22.560
Does Burch have it?

20:22.720 --> 20:24.216
- Yeah. Let's go.
- What part?

20:24.240 --> 20:26.357
Who's Burch?
Wait. What's happening?

20:27.760 --> 20:29.319
We need a component
to stop the tunnel

20:29.400 --> 20:30.914
from overloading again.

20:31.160 --> 20:33.675
I grabbed your clothes.
You might want to change.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.112
Look, I'd really like
to help you...

20:46.200 --> 20:47.336
but if I'm not at home
when they come

20:47.360 --> 20:48.560
to take off
my ankle monitor...

20:48.600 --> 20:50.034
then I'm going away forever.

20:50.200 --> 20:52.240
Once we get the component
and power up the tunnel...

20:52.320 --> 20:54.280
we'll get the message,
and have you home by lunch.

20:54.320 --> 20:56.516
We have to hurry.
The entanglement won't last.

20:56.680 --> 20:57.680
You owe us.

20:58.360 --> 21:00.158
All right, fine.
But can I just wait inside?

21:00.360 --> 21:01.920
Because I'm not supposed
to be out here.

21:11.960 --> 21:13.314
Let's go.

21:30.800 --> 21:32.314
- We good?
- Yeah.

21:32.520 --> 21:34.034
I'll be right back.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.676
- Can I have one of these?
- No.

21:57.920 --> 22:01.118
Ah. Susan! Welcome to <i>Oui!</i>

22:01.280 --> 22:02.919
Sonny!

22:03.080 --> 22:04.912
<i>Oui</i> is French
for "yes."

22:05.080 --> 22:07.320
As in "yes" to farm-to-table,
"yes" to locally sourced...

22:07.400 --> 22:09.995
and "yes" to planet
before profit.

22:11.160 --> 22:12.753
Well, let's hope
it also means "yes"

22:12.840 --> 22:14.440
to "Do you have the component
I ordered?"

22:16.880 --> 22:19.120
You know, I have always loved
your sense of humor, Susan.

22:19.200 --> 22:20.316
Have a seat.

22:20.520 --> 22:21.520
No, I'm good. Thank you.

22:21.560 --> 22:22.835
Who is this guy?

22:23.000 --> 22:26.038
Sonny Burch. He traffics
in black market technology.

22:26.640 --> 22:28.760
He's been getting us what
we need to build the tunnel.

22:31.120 --> 22:32.395
Could I just have one...

22:32.560 --> 22:33.560
No.

22:34.400 --> 22:37.632
You know, I have
a special friend at the FBI.

22:37.720 --> 22:38.870
And I say "special"...

22:39.080 --> 22:41.879
because, well,
he tells me things

22:41.960 --> 22:43.599
that I didn't previously know.

22:44.240 --> 22:45.879
For example...

22:46.040 --> 22:47.838
your name isn't Susan.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.231
It's Hope Van Dyne.

22:50.760 --> 22:53.673
And your unseen associate,
that's your father, Hank Pym.

22:53.840 --> 22:55.957
- That's not good, Hank.
- No shit.

23:03.760 --> 23:05.558
What do you want?

23:05.720 --> 23:07.871
Relationships
are built on trust, Hope.

23:08.040 --> 23:10.475
And I want our relationship
to have a strong foundation.

23:10.640 --> 23:11.710
Our relationship?

23:11.880 --> 23:14.634
My business landscape
has been shifting, Hope.

23:14.800 --> 23:16.736
Hell, S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA
don't even exist anymore...

23:16.760 --> 23:18.672
but now, Hank Pym...

23:18.840 --> 23:21.196
Hank Pym
is a real opportunity.

23:21.360 --> 23:22.430
Do you have a point?

23:22.600 --> 23:23.800
Oh, you think
that I don't know

23:23.880 --> 23:26.236
what you've been building
with all this?

23:26.400 --> 23:28.392
Quantum technology.

23:28.920 --> 23:31.435
Now, you can forget nanotech,
forget AI,

23:31.520 --> 23:32.715
forget cryptocurrency.

23:32.880 --> 23:34.439
Quantum energy is the future.

23:34.640 --> 23:36.313
It's the next gold rush.

23:36.480 --> 23:37.480
Is that so?

23:37.640 --> 23:39.040
I want in, Hope.

23:39.200 --> 23:41.669
So, as a gesture of good will,
I have taken the liberty...

23:41.840 --> 23:43.911
of arranging some buyers
for your lab.

23:44.560 --> 23:45.676
Starting bid...

23:46.360 --> 23:49.432
one billion dollars.

23:49.600 --> 23:51.193
Thank you, Sonny, really.

23:51.360 --> 23:52.616
But my father and I
have something

23:52.640 --> 23:55.030
slightly more pressing
than starting a business.

23:55.240 --> 23:58.358
So I'll just take
the component as arranged.

23:58.520 --> 24:00.716
My buyers don't take no
for an answer.

24:02.160 --> 24:03.760
So, we are
either in business together...

24:04.120 --> 24:06.589
or we aren't
in business together.

24:09.480 --> 24:11.437
Then I guess we aren't.

24:11.600 --> 24:13.432
You can go.

24:13.920 --> 24:16.355
But I'm afraid your money's
gonna have to remain.

24:16.720 --> 24:19.440
Let's call it compensation
for my injured feelings.

24:20.080 --> 24:21.594
Listen, Sonny.

24:21.760 --> 24:24.514
This is gonna be
so much easier on everybody

24:24.600 --> 24:26.114
if you just give me
that component.

24:26.280 --> 24:28.240
Darlin', the only thing
you're takin' from here...

24:28.360 --> 24:31.956
is my heart,
but it will mend in time.

24:33.600 --> 24:34.750
Okay.

24:43.240 --> 24:44.674
So, now what?

24:44.840 --> 24:45.956
You'll see.

24:46.880 --> 24:48.736
She said her and her daddy
had something pressing.

24:48.760 --> 24:49.936
- Mmm-hmm.
- I want to know what it is

24:49.960 --> 24:51.176
because if they're not working
with us...

24:51.200 --> 24:52.816
they're working with somebody.
So find out.

24:52.840 --> 24:53.956
I want some names...

24:58.640 --> 25:00.393
Hold on, you gave her wings?

25:06.800 --> 25:07.800
Get her.

25:23.840 --> 25:25.559
Not my turn-of-the-century
chandelier!

25:30.040 --> 25:31.713
Stop firing! Stop!

25:36.320 --> 25:37.834
All right, take this.
Go. Go, go, go!

25:38.280 --> 25:39.430
Go!

26:41.960 --> 26:43.599
Wings and blasters.

26:43.760 --> 26:45.776
So I take it you didn't have
that tech available for me.

26:45.800 --> 26:46.800
No, I did.

26:48.720 --> 26:51.076
It was a pleasure doing
business with you, Sonny.

26:51.240 --> 26:53.709
Oh, our business
isn't finished yet, Hope.

26:53.960 --> 26:55.553
I can assure you of that!

27:03.000 --> 27:04.878
What in the hell is that?

27:18.760 --> 27:20.194
Dad,
are you seeing this?

27:20.320 --> 27:21.320
Hope, get out of there!

27:29.960 --> 27:31.553
- I gotta do something.
- Wait!

27:37.200 --> 27:40.193
It is still
a work in progress.

27:58.840 --> 28:00.096
You taught me
that kick. Remember?

28:00.120 --> 28:01.315
Yeah, great form.

28:01.520 --> 28:03.416
Those were the days.
Whatever happened to us?

28:03.440 --> 28:04.640
Not the time, Scott.

28:05.040 --> 28:06.076
Damn it, where'd it go?

28:09.080 --> 28:10.080
I've lost it.

28:10.200 --> 28:12.000
<i>I'm not seeing anything
on the ant cams.</i>

28:12.080 --> 28:13.799
<i>Try looking...</i>

28:14.200 --> 28:15.200
Dad?

28:23.480 --> 28:25.278
Give me that.

28:25.360 --> 28:26.360
Now.

28:30.600 --> 28:32.080
- Are you okay?
- No!

28:32.280 --> 28:33.280
He got the lab.

28:33.480 --> 28:34.197
No.

28:34.440 --> 28:35.440
Come on!

28:37.840 --> 28:38.956
What was that?

28:39.160 --> 28:40.435
I don't know.

28:40.600 --> 28:42.432
But we need to find somewhere
to regroup

28:42.520 --> 28:44.352
and figure out
where the lab is.

28:45.080 --> 28:46.309
So, where to now?

28:46.680 --> 28:48.319
How about my house? Hmm?

28:48.480 --> 28:49.616
I'm supposed
to be there anyway,

28:49.640 --> 28:50.816
and Woo could walk in
any second.

28:50.840 --> 28:53.071
Exactly why we're not going
to your house.

28:53.240 --> 28:54.435
What about your house?

28:55.600 --> 28:57.319
Sorry.

28:57.480 --> 29:00.200
Well, there is one place
I can think of.

29:01.120 --> 29:02.120
No.

29:02.560 --> 29:04.995
No, no, no, no!

29:06.720 --> 29:07.720
No!

29:11.120 --> 29:12.315
Wow, Dr. Pym...

29:12.520 --> 29:13.840
who would've thought that,

29:13.920 --> 29:15.280
once again,
in your hour of need...

29:15.360 --> 29:17.397
that you would turn to us,
you know?

29:17.600 --> 29:18.600
Not me.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.878
Mmm. Help yourself.

29:21.040 --> 29:22.296
Hey, what's up
with the fancy pastry?

29:22.320 --> 29:23.680
We gotta keep
the food budget down.

29:23.800 --> 29:25.720
Well, what are we supposed
to have for breakfast?

29:25.760 --> 29:26.796
The oatmeal packets.

29:26.920 --> 29:28.513
Oatmeal packets.

29:28.680 --> 29:30.273
- It's insult.
- Why is it an insult?

29:30.440 --> 29:31.560
Because it tastes like sand.

29:31.600 --> 29:33.096
You know why?
'Cause it's organic.

29:33.120 --> 29:34.315
It's not organic, it's sand.

29:34.400 --> 29:35.736
It's the most important meal
of the day.

29:35.760 --> 29:36.557
You know what,
you can get creative with it.

29:36.640 --> 29:37.676
Break teeth.

29:37.760 --> 29:39.136
Put a little brown sugar on
it. You can put some cinnamon.

29:39.160 --> 29:40.336
Put a little honey.
Whatever you want...

29:40.360 --> 29:43.239
Guys, guys, guys.
Come on, man.

29:43.400 --> 29:45.039
We got bigger fish to fry.

29:45.240 --> 29:46.674
Is that my desk?

29:46.800 --> 29:48.393
- Yeah.
- What?

29:48.640 --> 29:49.994
Why do I have
such a small desk?

29:50.160 --> 29:51.776
Because you weren't there
when we were choosing desks.

29:51.800 --> 29:52.800
You snooze, you lose.

29:53.000 --> 29:53.797
Well, I was
under house arrest.

29:53.880 --> 29:54.631
Yeah.

29:54.720 --> 29:56.016
You know what,
this isn't even a desk.

29:56.040 --> 29:56.871
This is garbage.

29:57.040 --> 29:59.680
You found this outside
amongst garbage.

29:59.800 --> 30:00.995
I got it at a rummage sale.

30:01.160 --> 30:02.640
So, you save money
on my desk?

30:02.800 --> 30:03.800
Guys.

30:03.880 --> 30:05.917
Hope, please,
we need to focus, all right?

30:06.040 --> 30:08.271
We gotta find
that lab already. Jeez.

30:09.440 --> 30:10.800
Oh, you know what?
I heard stories,

30:10.880 --> 30:11.920
like what happened to you.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.176
This crazy, creepy cat, who
walks through walls and stuff.

30:14.200 --> 30:15.873
Like a ghost.

30:16.080 --> 30:17.560
Like Baba Yaga.

30:20.640 --> 30:23.200
Baba Yaga, the witch.

30:23.320 --> 30:26.074
They tell stories to children
to frighten them.

30:27.320 --> 30:28.674
You know Baba Yaga?

30:29.720 --> 30:31.074
Whoever stole it...

30:31.280 --> 30:32.680
we need to find it.

30:32.840 --> 30:36.277
Oh, you don't find someone
like that. They find you.

30:36.600 --> 30:38.193
Like Baba Yaga.

30:38.720 --> 30:41.076
Dr. Pym, you're the smartest
genius I know.

30:41.200 --> 30:43.590
Didn't you put some kind of
LoJack on your lab?

30:43.800 --> 30:44.870
Because if you didn't,

30:44.960 --> 30:46.917
we have a variety
of affordable options.

30:47.080 --> 30:50.471
Of course I did, Luis.
It was disabled.

30:50.600 --> 30:53.115
Whoever stole the lab knew
exactly what they were doing.

30:53.320 --> 30:55.232
They also looked like
they were phasing.

30:55.440 --> 30:56.440
Phasing?

30:56.600 --> 30:58.159
Quantum phasing.
When an object moves

30:58.240 --> 30:59.600
through different states
of matter.

30:59.800 --> 31:01.473
Oh, yeah,
that's what I was thinking.

31:01.600 --> 31:02.670
The lab emits radiation.

31:02.880 --> 31:05.440
Can we modify a quantum
spectrometer and track it?

31:05.600 --> 31:08.195
That could work, yes, but all
my equipment is in the lab.

31:08.360 --> 31:10.317
Where else can we find
that equipment?

31:12.320 --> 31:14.073
Well, there is one person.

31:15.240 --> 31:16.435
Bill Foster.

31:16.640 --> 31:17.640
Great!

31:17.840 --> 31:19.194
Who's Bill Foster?

31:19.360 --> 31:21.477
He's an old colleague of
my dad's, from S.H.I.E.L.D.

31:21.640 --> 31:23.359
They had a falling out
years ago.

31:23.520 --> 31:25.376
You seem to have a lot of
falling outs with people.

31:25.400 --> 31:27.392
It's probably
just a waste of time.

31:27.520 --> 31:29.512
Hey, I'm risking everything
by being here.

31:29.640 --> 31:30.880
Don't you think
we should check?

31:31.080 --> 31:33.356
We need to find out
who took the lab.

32:25.960 --> 32:27.360
Guys,
it's not a good idea

32:27.440 --> 32:28.874
to be out in the open
like this.

32:29.040 --> 32:31.874
Relax,
no one's gonna recognize us.

32:32.200 --> 32:34.396
What, because of hats
and sunglasses?

32:34.560 --> 32:36.040
That's not a disguise, Hank.

32:36.120 --> 32:38.316
We look like ourselves
at a baseball game.

32:38.480 --> 32:40.358
<i>In an isolated system...</i>

32:40.560 --> 32:45.077
particles co-exist in
a stable phase relationship.

32:45.280 --> 32:47.431
If the system
is interfered with,

32:47.520 --> 32:50.718
that stability becomes chaos.

32:50.840 --> 32:52.672
Unpredictable.

32:52.840 --> 32:55.230
Dangerous.
Beautiful.

32:55.840 --> 32:57.752
Isolated completely,
a quantum system

32:57.840 --> 33:00.196
would revert back to
separate states of matter...

33:00.360 --> 33:03.990
each entangled with a distinct
state of its environment.

33:04.120 --> 33:06.680
In other words,
the object in question

33:06.760 --> 33:08.433
would be both
in and out of phase...

33:08.600 --> 33:11.832
with multiple
parallel realities.

33:16.640 --> 33:20.350
Speaking of being out of phase
with reality.

33:20.480 --> 33:23.279
I am noticing
an unusually high number

33:23.360 --> 33:25.670
of glazed eyes out there
among you.

33:26.880 --> 33:29.714
So, why don't we call it
a few minutes early?

33:29.880 --> 33:31.030
That'll be enough for today.

33:31.120 --> 33:32.873
Thank you, ladies
and gentlemen, you may go.

33:34.880 --> 33:37.634
It's incredible.
You're linked to Janet.

33:38.400 --> 33:40.756
It's quantum entanglement
between the quantum states of

33:40.840 --> 33:42.638
Posner molecules
in your brains.

33:42.840 --> 33:44.240
Yeah, that's what
I was thinking.

33:45.560 --> 33:46.391
Do you guys
just put the word "quantum"

33:46.480 --> 33:47.480
in front of everything?

33:47.520 --> 33:49.239
Doctor, we need to
find our lab.

33:49.400 --> 33:50.754
Hope, I'd love to help you...

33:51.000 --> 33:51.558
but I don't have anything

33:51.640 --> 33:52.391
like the equipment
you're describing.

33:52.560 --> 33:54.680
I told you this is a waste
of time. Come on, let's go.

33:54.800 --> 33:55.960
Don't condescend, Hank.

33:56.120 --> 33:58.112
You're the one who's
on the run from the FBI.

33:58.280 --> 34:00.112
All because
you had to grow to a size

34:00.200 --> 34:01.919
that finally fit your ego.

34:02.080 --> 34:05.391
That wasn't me in Germany.
It was this idiot.

34:05.600 --> 34:06.600
Really?

34:08.080 --> 34:10.150
Going that big,
it must've been exhausting.

34:10.360 --> 34:12.591
I slept for three days
straight. You have no idea.

34:12.719 --> 34:13.835
Actually, I do.

34:13.960 --> 34:15.713
Back in the day,
I was Hank's partner

34:15.800 --> 34:17.553
on a project called Goliath.

34:17.719 --> 34:19.074
Excuse me?
You were my partner?

34:19.239 --> 34:21.197
The only thing more tiring
than going that big

34:21.280 --> 34:23.192
is putting up
with Hank's bullshit.

34:23.360 --> 34:24.719
Right...

34:26.239 --> 34:28.960
I don't know.
How big did you get?

34:29.239 --> 34:31.880
My record? 21 feet.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.434
- Not bad.
- You?

34:33.679 --> 34:34.431
I don't...

34:34.600 --> 34:35.600
No, really, I'm curious.

34:36.560 --> 34:38.233
- 65 feet. Yeah.
- Whoa!

34:38.440 --> 34:40.079
- Huge.
- 65.

34:40.239 --> 34:42.630
If you two are finished
comparing sizes...

34:42.760 --> 34:44.956
we need to figure out a way
to track down the lab.

34:45.120 --> 34:48.112
And the great Hank Pym hasn't
figured that one out yet?

34:48.239 --> 34:49.958
Strange.

34:50.120 --> 34:51.873
You had all the answers
back in the day.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.400
That's why I left the project.

34:53.600 --> 34:55.512
Left? I fired you.

34:55.639 --> 34:56.880
Best decision
I ever made.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.117
Hank was a terrible partner.
Temperamental...

34:59.280 --> 35:01.351
stubborn, impatient.

35:01.520 --> 35:03.477
Sooner or later,
he just pushed everyone away.

35:03.640 --> 35:05.040
Just the mediocrities.

35:05.160 --> 35:07.231
Janet was the only one
who could endure him

35:07.320 --> 35:08.390
and chose to stick it out.

35:08.520 --> 35:09.520
Watch it, Bill.

35:09.640 --> 35:11.160
She paid the price,
though, didn't she?

35:11.240 --> 35:12.356
You son of a bitch.

35:12.480 --> 35:14.676
I didn't come here
to listen to you two squabble.

35:14.880 --> 35:16.280
I'm trying to save my mother.

35:17.880 --> 35:19.280
Now, which office
would you say?

35:19.480 --> 35:20.480
Oh, it's Woo.

35:21.160 --> 35:22.674
Someone must have seen me.

35:22.800 --> 35:24.029
Relax. If this is about you,

35:24.120 --> 35:25.918
they'd be in your house
by now.

35:28.520 --> 35:29.520
What are you, 15?

35:29.680 --> 35:30.776
Come on.
We gotta go right now.

35:30.800 --> 35:33.872
Wait. You might be able to
improvise that tracker...

35:34.360 --> 35:35.536
if you modify
the diffraction units

35:35.560 --> 35:36.630
on one of your regulators.

35:37.080 --> 35:39.072
- That could work.
- I don't know what that means.

35:39.280 --> 35:41.272
Thank you. Thank you.

35:52.520 --> 35:54.159
But, Doctor,
campus police says

35:54.240 --> 35:56.038
they ID'd both Pym
and Van Dyne.

35:56.160 --> 35:57.536
I don't know
what to tell you, Agent.

35:57.560 --> 35:59.517
I haven't talked to Hank
in 30 years.

35:59.640 --> 36:00.816
I can assure you
I'm the last person

36:00.840 --> 36:01.876
he would want to visit.

36:02.040 --> 36:03.176
Oh, come on,
you expect us to...

36:03.200 --> 36:04.200
Hey, hey.

36:04.520 --> 36:05.520
Why is that?

36:06.160 --> 36:08.880
Simple.
We hate each other's guts.

36:09.880 --> 36:11.360
So I'm a terrible partner?

36:11.560 --> 36:13.916
Foster, he hasn't had
one good idea

36:14.000 --> 36:15.150
in his unremarkable career.

36:15.400 --> 36:17.480
But his idea about the
diffractors could work, right?

36:17.520 --> 36:19.273
Fine, one decent idea.

36:19.440 --> 36:21.318
Except, I eliminated
the diffractors

36:21.400 --> 36:23.278
when I upgraded the suits.

36:25.760 --> 36:27.877
So, if we had an old suit,

36:27.960 --> 36:30.077
we might be able
to track down the lab?

36:30.240 --> 36:31.560
Yes, but we don't.

36:33.960 --> 36:35.679
- What if we did?
- What do you mean?

36:37.080 --> 36:38.196
I mean...

36:39.400 --> 36:40.436
life's funny.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.552
Oh, my God.
You didn't destroy the suit.

36:42.720 --> 36:43.551
What?

36:43.720 --> 36:45.951
Well, it was
your life's work, Hank.

36:46.160 --> 36:47.594
I couldn't destroy that.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.150
Before I turned myself in,

36:50.240 --> 36:51.576
I shrunk it down
and mailed it to Luis.

36:51.600 --> 36:53.910
You sent my suit
through the mail?

36:54.320 --> 36:56.073
Hey, the postal service
is very reliable.

36:56.200 --> 36:59.477
You know, they do tracking
numbers now. Like UPS.

36:59.680 --> 37:00.680
Where is it?

37:00.840 --> 37:03.230
It's in a very safe place,
all right? Don't worry.

37:03.440 --> 37:06.080
What, the trophy?
No, it's not here.

37:06.240 --> 37:07.776
What do you mean it's not
there? Where could it be?

37:07.800 --> 37:09.200
I looked everywhere.
It's not here.

37:09.280 --> 37:10.696
Hey, get away from the plant.

37:10.720 --> 37:12.680
But I put it back
after Cassie and I...

37:13.840 --> 37:15.354
Show-and-tell.

37:15.480 --> 37:16.480
Scotty?

37:18.600 --> 37:19.600
No, stop!

37:20.240 --> 37:22.471
Well, the good news is
I know where it is.

37:28.960 --> 37:30.296
Whenever you go
back to school...

37:30.320 --> 37:32.176
isn't everything supposed to
look so much smaller?

37:32.200 --> 37:33.634
This place seems huge.

37:33.720 --> 37:34.840
<i>What is it?</i>

37:34.920 --> 37:36.096
It's the new regulator.

37:36.120 --> 37:38.032
Hank, what's going on
with this suit?

37:38.120 --> 37:39.759
How much of
a work in progress is this?

37:41.240 --> 37:44.392
Uh-oh.
No, no, no.

37:52.760 --> 37:53.760
Oh.

37:56.640 --> 37:58.597
What are you, laughing?
Please, could you just...

37:58.760 --> 38:00.240
Okay, okay.

38:03.640 --> 38:04.640
<i>What do you see?</i>

38:04.800 --> 38:06.917
The sizing coils
are malfunctioning.

38:07.040 --> 38:08.394
Just let me...

38:08.520 --> 38:10.273
Ow!

38:12.160 --> 38:13.230
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

38:15.880 --> 38:18.236
Okay.
All right.

38:18.800 --> 38:20.154
Try that.

38:24.160 --> 38:25.310
Sorry.

38:26.440 --> 38:27.440
What?

38:31.200 --> 38:32.200
Awesome.

38:32.320 --> 38:34.277
If only Cap could see you now.

38:34.440 --> 38:36.432
Hilarious.
What are we gonna do?

38:47.280 --> 38:48.680
Hey!

38:48.840 --> 38:49.956
Where's your hall pass?

38:51.960 --> 38:53.440
Hey, I'm talking to you.

38:55.160 --> 38:56.160
Hey!

38:57.560 --> 38:59.153
Hey. Eh...

39:23.760 --> 39:25.672
You can do it.

39:25.880 --> 39:27.951
You almost got it.

39:40.120 --> 39:41.873
Oh, peanut.

39:54.400 --> 39:55.834
Okay, let's go.

40:11.840 --> 40:14.036
Hiya, champ,
how was school today?

40:15.280 --> 40:17.556
All right, get your jokes out
now. Can you fix the suit?

40:17.760 --> 40:19.160
So cranky.

40:19.360 --> 40:21.920
You want a juice box
and some string cheese?

40:22.000 --> 40:24.037
Do you really have that?

40:33.600 --> 40:35.273
Let's see
if Foster was right.

40:48.640 --> 40:50.233
This has gotta be the lab.

40:54.120 --> 40:55.190
Let's go get it.

40:55.400 --> 40:56.400
Yeah.

41:05.840 --> 41:07.274
This seems right.

41:08.760 --> 41:11.673
Look at us, teaming up twice
in one day.

41:11.840 --> 41:13.320
Makes you think, huh?

41:13.480 --> 41:14.516
About what?

41:14.680 --> 41:16.353
Germany.

41:16.520 --> 41:17.520
What do you mean?

41:17.560 --> 41:20.234
We were working together,
training together...

41:20.400 --> 41:22.835
and other stuffing together.

41:23.400 --> 41:25.357
If I had asked you,
would you have come?

41:25.520 --> 41:27.079
I guess we'll never know.

41:27.240 --> 41:28.754
But I do know one thing.

41:28.960 --> 41:29.960
What?

41:30.040 --> 41:32.794
If I had,
you'd have never been caught.

41:40.480 --> 41:41.960
Hey, Scott.

41:42.120 --> 41:44.351
You think you can stop
daydreaming about my daughter

41:44.480 --> 41:45.960
long enough to get my lab?

41:46.120 --> 41:47.952
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

41:53.400 --> 41:55.119
Okay, you're transmitting.

41:55.320 --> 41:56.536
What took you so long?

41:56.560 --> 41:58.916
Sorry, I had to come
up with a name for my ant.

41:59.120 --> 42:01.396
I'm thinking
Ulysses S. Gr-Ant.

42:01.840 --> 42:02.840
You like it?

42:03.040 --> 42:04.190
Hilarious.

42:05.360 --> 42:07.136
<i>I'm not getting anything
on the monitors.</i>

42:07.160 --> 42:09.311
There's some kind of
electronic disturbance.

42:09.600 --> 42:10.431
<i>Be careful.</i>

42:10.600 --> 42:12.760
You know me, Hank.
I'm always careful... Whoa!

42:13.600 --> 42:15.136
It's okay.
It's just the suit.

42:15.160 --> 42:16.760
- How do you know?
- Look.

42:20.280 --> 42:21.714
That's Ghost?

42:21.880 --> 42:23.155
What is she doing?

42:23.320 --> 42:24.496
Do you think
that suit is how

42:24.520 --> 42:26.273
she goes through walls
and stuff?

42:26.640 --> 42:28.496
Let's just get outta
here before she wakes up.

42:28.520 --> 42:30.671
Hope,
look! There's the lab.

42:36.360 --> 42:38.352
Now, we're sure
this is our shrunken building

42:38.440 --> 42:39.536
and not
somebody else's, right?

42:39.560 --> 42:41.800
Just take it, Scott.
Come on, we gotta be fast.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
I'll get it.

42:45.520 --> 42:47.000
Oh, shit...

42:59.560 --> 43:02.029
Hope. Hope! Hank.

43:02.440 --> 43:03.954
Guys.

43:04.120 --> 43:06.316
I don't think
they can hear you.

43:08.880 --> 43:10.155
Hi.

43:10.800 --> 43:12.234
I'm Ava.

43:12.640 --> 43:13.915
Scott.

43:16.320 --> 43:17.913
So, you don't need the suit...

43:19.960 --> 43:21.792
to go through things.

43:22.440 --> 43:23.590
No.

43:23.920 --> 43:27.470
It just helps me control it.

43:29.000 --> 43:32.710
And the pain, supposedly.

43:37.200 --> 43:38.576
You're not gonna reach
into my chest

43:38.600 --> 43:39.954
and crush my heart, are you?

43:43.640 --> 43:45.154
You're funny.

43:48.080 --> 43:51.039
I'm not gonna hurt you, Scott,
unless I have to.

43:53.720 --> 43:55.473
I need...

43:56.640 --> 43:58.632
what's in your head.

44:12.720 --> 44:14.040
Let's wake up
the rest of the gang

44:14.080 --> 44:15.360
and get this over with,
shall we?

44:18.320 --> 44:19.356
Get up!

44:20.160 --> 44:21.160
Come on!

44:23.960 --> 44:25.030
Dad?

44:27.320 --> 44:29.277
Don't ever touch him again.

44:29.440 --> 44:30.840
Now, now, Hope...

44:31.880 --> 44:33.496
I think I'm being rather
gentle with your father,

44:33.520 --> 44:34.715
all things considered.

44:35.800 --> 44:37.439
What the hell
are you talking about?

44:38.360 --> 44:41.637
Another casualty
of Hank Pym's ego.

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
Bill.

44:45.560 --> 44:47.199
What have you done?

44:47.480 --> 44:50.200
It's what you've done,
Dr. Pym.

44:50.640 --> 44:52.074
You're with her?

44:52.240 --> 44:54.471
Oh, man.
I thought you were cool.

44:54.640 --> 44:56.233
What the hell
is going on here?

44:56.640 --> 44:58.871
I doubt Hank has
ever mentioned my father.

45:00.040 --> 45:01.315
Why would he?

45:01.480 --> 45:03.551
Elihas Starr.

45:04.480 --> 45:06.915
They were colleagues
at S.H.I.E.L.D.

45:07.080 --> 45:08.400
Quantum research.

45:09.240 --> 45:13.154
Until my father dare disagree
with the great Hank Pym.

45:13.600 --> 45:15.000
You had him fired.

45:15.160 --> 45:17.231
Oh, and discredited
for good measure.

45:20.600 --> 45:24.719
My father tried to continue
his research on his own.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.959
Desperate to restore his name,
so he took risks.

45:29.160 --> 45:30.160
No, no, no!

45:31.200 --> 45:32.200
Too many.

45:33.400 --> 45:35.357
<i>Until something went wrong.</i>

45:36.360 --> 45:37.874
He told us to run.

45:38.040 --> 45:38.871
Elihas, what's happening?

45:39.040 --> 45:40.440
Just go. Go!

45:40.600 --> 45:42.831
Daddy! Daddy!

45:43.000 --> 45:44.275
<i>I could tell
he was scared.</i>

45:49.880 --> 45:50.711
Daddy!

45:50.880 --> 45:51.950
Ava, no!

45:55.200 --> 45:56.998
<i>I didn't want him
to be alone.</i>

45:58.480 --> 45:59.755
No! No!

46:07.520 --> 46:09.751
<i>When I woke up,
my parents were dead.</i>

46:12.440 --> 46:14.238
<i>I wasn't so lucky.</i>

46:19.040 --> 46:22.033
<i>They call it
"molecular disequilibrium."</i>

46:23.120 --> 46:25.077
<i>A rather dull name, I think.</i>

46:25.240 --> 46:28.119
<i>Doesn't quite do justice
to what it means.</i>

46:28.680 --> 46:32.356
Every cell in my body
is torn apart...

46:32.560 --> 46:34.074
and stitched back together.

46:35.000 --> 46:36.593
Over and over.

46:36.760 --> 46:38.353
Every day.

46:39.880 --> 46:41.792
I was still at S.H.I.E.L.D.
when I got the call

46:41.880 --> 46:44.600
about a quantum anomaly
in Argentina.

46:47.840 --> 46:48.840
Hello, Ava.

46:50.400 --> 46:51.516
My name's Bill.

46:52.280 --> 46:54.158
I was a friend
of your father's.

46:56.320 --> 46:57.595
I brought you something.

47:02.120 --> 47:04.271
It's all right.
Try again.

47:05.840 --> 47:07.069
That's it.

47:07.440 --> 47:10.114
<i>Dr. Foster did his best
to keep me safe.</i>

47:10.800 --> 47:12.280
But others at S.H.I.E.L.D.

47:12.360 --> 47:15.000
saw an opportunity
in my affliction.

47:18.240 --> 47:19.833
<i>They built me
a containment suit,</i>

47:19.920 --> 47:21.479
<i>so I could control my phasing.</i>

47:22.240 --> 47:23.959
<i>And trained me
to be a stealth operative.</i>

47:25.400 --> 47:26.400
<i>They weaponized me.</i>

47:27.720 --> 47:29.279
<i>I stole for them.
Spied for them.</i>

47:30.960 --> 47:32.394
<i>Killed for them.</i>

47:32.880 --> 47:34.951
And in exchange for my soul...

47:35.280 --> 47:37.033
they were going to cure me.

47:40.360 --> 47:42.113
They lied.

47:43.080 --> 47:45.640
When S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed,
I took Ava in.

47:46.040 --> 47:47.838
I built the chamber
to slow her decay,

47:47.920 --> 47:49.216
but her condition
was progressive.

47:49.240 --> 47:51.360
I didn't know how to cure it.

47:52.040 --> 47:54.714
She wanted to kill you, Hank,
but I told her no...

47:54.880 --> 47:56.216
and that she should
watch you instead.

47:56.240 --> 47:57.720
And sure enough,
she discovered

47:57.800 --> 47:59.120
that you were
building the tunnel.

48:01.440 --> 48:03.159
Then, she told me about Lang.

48:03.320 --> 48:05.789
And the message from Janet
inside his head,

48:05.880 --> 48:07.416
that's when I...

48:07.440 --> 48:08.440
Christ's sake!

48:08.600 --> 48:09.954
That's me. I'm sorry.

48:10.040 --> 48:11.633
Look, can you tell me
who's texting me?

48:12.720 --> 48:14.393
"Cassie, 911."

48:14.560 --> 48:16.472
That's my daughter.
I need to text her back.

48:16.640 --> 48:17.869
No, that's not happening.

48:18.080 --> 48:19.912
What, it's 911.
That means it's an emergency.

48:20.120 --> 48:21.759
You're not making
demands here, Lang.

48:21.960 --> 48:23.917
You're not appreciating
the gravity of the...

48:25.160 --> 48:26.856
Okay, look, she's trying
to video chat me now.

48:26.880 --> 48:29.634
Something might be wrong.
Let me talk to her. Please.

48:32.240 --> 48:34.038
Cassie, are you okay?
What's the emergency?

48:34.200 --> 48:35.919
<i>I can't find my soccer shoes.</i>

48:36.200 --> 48:37.031
What?

48:37.200 --> 48:38.270
<i>I have a game tomorrow.</i>

48:38.440 --> 48:39.656
<i>Hey, Scott,
I know that they're there.</i>

48:39.680 --> 48:41.176
<i>Can you just walk the phone
around the house?</i>

48:41.200 --> 48:42.600
No, I can't do that right now.

48:42.760 --> 48:44.513
<i>- Why not?</i>
- Because I'm sick.

48:44.680 --> 48:45.776
<i>Hey, can you just
maybe look around</i>

48:45.800 --> 48:46.856
<i>later then and call me back?</i>

48:46.880 --> 48:48.200
<i>Please? Thank you.</i>

48:48.400 --> 48:49.595
<i>Bye, Daddy!</i>

48:49.760 --> 48:51.513
- Bye, peanut!
<i>- Feel better!</i>

48:51.680 --> 48:52.680
<i>Feel better, buddy!</i>

48:53.040 --> 48:55.555
I'm sorry.
It said emergency.

48:55.880 --> 48:57.553
Ava, I want to help you.

48:57.720 --> 48:59.720
She doesn't need your help.
I know how to save her.

48:59.880 --> 49:01.109
Oh, really? How?

49:01.280 --> 49:02.280
Janet.

49:02.480 --> 49:03.976
For the last 30 years,
she's been down there

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
absorbing quantum energy.

49:05.160 --> 49:06.514
We can extract that energy.

49:06.680 --> 49:08.990
We can use it to repair
Ava's molecular structure...

49:09.160 --> 49:09.991
Extract it?

49:10.160 --> 49:11.230
- Yes.
- Are you insane?

49:11.400 --> 49:12.993
That would rip Janet apart.

49:13.160 --> 49:15.994
You don't know that.
I'm gonna fire up your tunnel.

49:16.160 --> 49:17.435
When Janet's location

49:17.520 --> 49:19.016
pops into Lang's head,
he's gonna give it to me...

49:19.040 --> 49:20.838
or I'm gonna turn him over
to the FBI.

49:21.000 --> 49:21.672
What?

49:21.840 --> 49:23.593
You are gonna
stay here...

49:23.760 --> 49:25.752
just in case I need your help.

49:26.720 --> 49:28.074
Like hell I would help you!

49:28.240 --> 49:29.435
You'll do whatever I say.

49:29.600 --> 49:30.776
You're gonna kill Janet!

49:30.800 --> 49:32.632
I'd be more worried
about yourself, Hank.

49:32.800 --> 49:35.269
Goddamn it, Bill!

49:35.720 --> 49:37.200
- Dad?
- Calm down, Hank.

49:37.800 --> 49:39.075
So help me God...

49:40.080 --> 49:40.752
The pills.

49:40.920 --> 49:42.434
It's his heart!
He needs his pills.

49:42.600 --> 49:45.479
Please, Dr. Foster.
They're in the tin. Please.

49:46.760 --> 49:48.240
He could die!

49:48.400 --> 49:49.436
Come on!

49:49.600 --> 49:50.600
Help him!

49:50.880 --> 49:52.240
Dad, just hang on,
all right?

49:52.280 --> 49:53.555
Just keep breathing.
Stay calm.

49:53.760 --> 49:55.035
Help him, man! Come on!

49:55.200 --> 49:56.200
The Altoid tin!

49:58.360 --> 49:59.360
Wait!

50:03.520 --> 50:04.520
Thanks, guys.

50:05.400 --> 50:06.470
Hank!

50:18.360 --> 50:20.955
Bill is filling
that girl's head with lies.

50:21.160 --> 50:24.358
Elihas Starr was a traitor.
He stole my plans.

50:24.600 --> 50:26.876
Now, bring it down.
All right, lock it in.

50:27.080 --> 50:29.595
No, no, no.
The bolt is on the other side.

50:29.760 --> 50:32.514
Tighten that one down,
then bring it down one notch.

50:32.680 --> 50:33.680
Good job.

50:34.080 --> 50:35.080
It'll work.

50:35.240 --> 50:37.232
Foster, he could have fried
the entire system.

50:37.400 --> 50:38.560
Look, we'll adjust the relays

50:38.680 --> 50:40.520
while you go reprogram
the settings, all right?

50:40.640 --> 50:42.233
It's going to be fine.

50:48.280 --> 50:49.111
So, this is it.

50:49.280 --> 50:51.237
Yeah. You'd think
with all this time

50:51.360 --> 50:52.874
to prepare I'd be more ready.

50:53.040 --> 50:55.953
Oh, going subatomic isn't
something you can prepare for.

50:56.120 --> 50:58.510
It kind of melts your mind.

50:58.680 --> 51:00.512
I mean seeing my mom again.

51:00.760 --> 51:01.830
Oh.

51:03.480 --> 51:05.711
What if she's a completely
different person?

51:05.880 --> 51:08.315
Yeah, like, uh,
George Washington.

51:08.480 --> 51:09.834
I'm serious, Scott.

51:10.400 --> 51:12.073
Or George Jefferson.

51:13.920 --> 51:15.957
What if she's forgotten
about me?

51:17.200 --> 51:19.157
When I was in prison...

51:19.320 --> 51:21.880
the only thing that got me
through was Cassie.

51:22.040 --> 51:23.416
I could have been locked up
for 100 years...

51:23.440 --> 51:24.794
I never would have
forgotten her.

51:27.080 --> 51:29.072
I know your mom
is counting the minutes

51:29.160 --> 51:31.117
until she can see you again.

51:32.720 --> 51:33.870
Thank you.

51:41.440 --> 51:42.237
Hey.

51:42.400 --> 51:43.720
We got a big problem.

51:43.880 --> 51:44.791
You forgot
the motion sensor lights

51:44.880 --> 51:45.677
on the back of the building.

51:45.840 --> 51:47.320
Oh, no.

51:47.480 --> 51:48.994
And they're on the proposal,

51:49.080 --> 51:50.696
and Karapetyan
asked for them specifically.

51:50.720 --> 51:54.111
Uh, yeah, look,
it's been a little crazy.

51:55.080 --> 51:56.976
Look, maybe I could stop by
tomorrow, take a look at it.

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
No. No, no, no, no.

51:58.040 --> 51:59.256
The meeting is first thing
in the morning.

51:59.280 --> 52:00.680
You gotta come right now
and fix it.

52:00.880 --> 52:02.872
I can't. I wish I could,
but I can't leave.

52:03.040 --> 52:04.176
You know what,
I'm coming to you.

52:04.200 --> 52:06.635
I'll just bring the plans.
They're on the laptop.

52:06.800 --> 52:08.075
And you can fix them there.

52:08.160 --> 52:09.480
Just tell me
where you are, okay?

52:09.640 --> 52:10.640
It's complicated.

52:10.720 --> 52:12.040
What do you mean
it's complicated?

52:16.080 --> 52:18.117
As you can see, sir,

52:18.200 --> 52:20.271
this system
is state of the art.

52:20.440 --> 52:22.671
Security of tomorrow, today.

52:22.840 --> 52:23.990
Oh, that's so good!

52:24.080 --> 52:25.816
And I love the lean-in, bro.
Keep practicin'.

52:25.840 --> 52:26.856
Hey, I just gotta
drive up to Scotty's,

52:26.880 --> 52:27.880
so we can fix the plans.

52:27.960 --> 52:29.536
But don't worry, I'll be back
in plenty of time.

52:29.560 --> 52:31.836
- As you can see...
- Oh, oh, oh!

52:32.640 --> 52:34.456
Tell me you got the van washed
for tomorrow morning.

52:34.480 --> 52:36.039
Down to the undercarriage,
baby.

52:36.200 --> 52:37.656
You sprung
for the undercarriage wash?

52:37.680 --> 52:38.909
Well, you said get the works.

52:39.080 --> 52:41.296
That's a scam, bro. We live
in California, not Minnesota.

52:41.320 --> 52:42.470
He's right.

52:43.240 --> 52:45.357
The undercarriage wash,

52:45.440 --> 52:46.954
that's for cleaning
off road salt...

52:47.120 --> 52:50.318
laid down in our
more snow-laden sister states.

52:50.520 --> 52:51.736
Who are you,
and why do you know so much

52:51.760 --> 52:52.955
about car wash protocol?

52:53.880 --> 52:55.473
Well, my name is Sonny Burch.

52:55.640 --> 52:58.109
And I do my research, Luis.

52:59.400 --> 53:02.677
To wit, I have learned
from a friend of mine...

53:02.840 --> 53:04.479
at the FBI that you are

53:04.560 --> 53:06.199
a known associate
of Scott Lang...

53:06.360 --> 53:09.319
a known associate of Hank Pym,
who I've also learned...

53:09.480 --> 53:12.120
has a portable
shrinking laboratory...

53:12.280 --> 53:14.636
filled with
all kinds of juicy tech.

53:14.800 --> 53:17.474
And you're gonna tell me
where it is.

53:17.760 --> 53:19.160
Well, I hate to
break it to you,

53:19.240 --> 53:21.357
but I don't know
what you're talking about.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.435
Well, I sense a resistance
in you, Luis.

53:24.600 --> 53:27.479
And I have promised results
to some dangerous people.

53:27.680 --> 53:31.515
So, I'm gonna introduce you
to my good friend, Uzman.

53:32.560 --> 53:34.040
Now...

53:34.200 --> 53:36.032
Uzman is a master

53:36.120 --> 53:38.157
at extracting information
from the unwilling...

53:38.360 --> 53:39.794
through psychoactive means.

53:41.800 --> 53:43.120
Oh, is that truth serum?

53:43.720 --> 53:45.712
There's no such thing
as truth serum.

53:45.880 --> 53:47.234
That's just nonsense from TV.

53:47.400 --> 53:48.993
Well, what is it then?

53:49.200 --> 53:50.759
It's a little concoction

53:50.840 --> 53:53.560
that he's been perfecting
since his days with the S.I.S.

53:53.720 --> 53:56.599
It makes you suggestible
and highly responsive.

53:56.760 --> 53:57.896
Well, dude,
that's truth serum.

53:57.920 --> 53:58.637
No, it's not.

53:58.800 --> 54:01.838
No offensing, but they sound
like truth serum to me.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.037
- Right?
- It's not a truth serum.

54:04.200 --> 54:05.520
Okay. Hey, I believe you.

54:05.720 --> 54:07.000
It's not a truth serum.

54:07.080 --> 54:10.357
I mean, if it walk like duck
and talk like ducks...

54:10.520 --> 54:11.590
The truth serum.

54:11.760 --> 54:13.513
Well, I have
a lot of allergies...

54:13.680 --> 54:15.512
so you might wanna think
about that.

54:18.520 --> 54:20.113
We've got to get
that lab back.

54:21.480 --> 54:22.480
What?

54:23.400 --> 54:25.710
The chamber and the suit
are barely helping anymore.

54:27.360 --> 54:29.079
How long have I got?

54:32.400 --> 54:33.959
A couple of weeks, maybe.

54:36.320 --> 54:38.551
Well, then we'll make them
bring the lab back.

54:38.720 --> 54:39.720
How?

54:40.880 --> 54:43.111
Lang. He has
a daughter, right?

54:43.280 --> 54:44.316
You can't mean that.

54:44.480 --> 54:45.880
Ava!

54:47.800 --> 54:49.760
I tolerate a lot of the things
you do out there...

54:49.840 --> 54:51.672
but I won't be a part
of anything like that.

54:52.320 --> 54:53.416
You're not the one who's about

54:53.440 --> 54:55.193
to fade away
into nothing, Bill.

54:55.360 --> 54:56.396
I am!

54:57.120 --> 54:59.077
You said you could fix me!

55:01.680 --> 55:03.433
You promised.

55:03.600 --> 55:05.432
I know. I will.

55:05.600 --> 55:06.875
But not like that.

55:09.440 --> 55:11.477
You lay one finger
on that little girl...

55:11.960 --> 55:14.429
I won't help you.
And we're done.

55:19.920 --> 55:21.673
Fine.

55:22.560 --> 55:24.631
There are other options.

55:38.400 --> 55:40.676
You know what? You're right.
This isn't truth serum.

55:40.840 --> 55:42.040
Because I don't feel anything.

55:42.200 --> 55:43.919
That was a lie.
I do feel something.

55:44.080 --> 55:45.080
This is truth serum!

55:45.120 --> 55:46.120
There's no such thing!

55:46.280 --> 55:47.794
Okay.

55:47.960 --> 55:50.111
Okay, okay.

55:50.320 --> 55:52.596
Now, I'm gonna make this
real easy for you, Luis.

55:52.760 --> 55:54.194
Okay.

55:56.240 --> 55:59.312
Where is Scott Lang?

55:59.720 --> 56:00.920
Well, see, that's complicated.

56:01.040 --> 56:02.976
Because when I first met
Scotty, he was in a bad place.

56:03.000 --> 56:04.520
<i>And I'm not talkin'
about cell block D.</i>

56:04.600 --> 56:06.256
<i>His wife had just filed for
divorce, and I was, like...</i>

56:06.280 --> 56:08.320
<i>"Damn, homie. She dumped you
when you're on lockup?"</i>

56:08.360 --> 56:09.376
<i>And he was, like,
"Yeah, I know.</i>

56:09.400 --> 56:10.496
<i>"I thought I was gonna be
with her forever...</i>

56:10.520 --> 56:11.520
<i>"but now I'm all alone."</i>

56:11.600 --> 56:12.816
<i>And I was, like, "Damn, homie.
You know what?</i>

56:12.840 --> 56:14.216
<i>"You gotta chin up, because
you'll find a new partner.</i>

56:14.240 --> 56:15.469
<i>"But you know what? I'm Luis."</i>

56:15.680 --> 56:16.816
<i>And he says,
"You know what? I'm Scotty,</i>

56:16.840 --> 56:18.016
<i>"and we're gonna be
best friends."</i>

56:18.040 --> 56:19.056
Okay, hold on, hold on.

56:19.080 --> 56:20.776
I like a good story
as much as the next person...

56:20.800 --> 56:22.016
but what in the hell
does this have to do

56:22.040 --> 56:23.190
with where Scott Lang is?

56:23.400 --> 56:24.197
I'm getting there.
I'm getting there.

56:24.400 --> 56:25.629
You put a dime in him,

56:25.720 --> 56:27.056
you gotta let the whole song
play out.

56:27.080 --> 56:28.799
He like human jukebox.

56:28.960 --> 56:30.776
Oh, my <i>abuelita</i> had a jukebox
in the restaurant!

56:30.800 --> 56:32.996
<i>Yeah, only played Morrissey.</i>

56:33.200 --> 56:34.696
<i>And if anybody ever
complained, she'd be like...</i>

56:35.840 --> 56:37.320
<i>You know, Chicanos,
we call him "Moz."</i>

56:37.480 --> 56:38.480
<i>Then</i>, iadios!

56:38.600 --> 56:40.000
What can I say?
We relate to his

56:40.080 --> 56:41.400
melancholy ballads,
you know?

56:41.560 --> 56:42.789
- Lang!
- Right, right, right.

56:43.000 --> 56:44.096
So, anyway,
Scotty gets out of jail,

56:44.120 --> 56:45.216
and he starts working
for Hank.

56:45.240 --> 56:46.536
<i>That's when he met Hope.
And Hope's all, like...</i>

56:46.560 --> 56:47.914
<i>"I want nothing to do
with you.</i>

56:48.000 --> 56:49.593
<i>"Look at my hairdo,
I'm all business."</i>

56:49.800 --> 56:50.800
<i>And then Scotty's, like,</i>

56:50.840 --> 56:51.976
<i>"You know what, girl?
My heart is all broken.</i>

56:52.000 --> 56:53.096
<i>"And I'll probably
never find love again,</i>

56:53.120 --> 56:54.376
<i>"but damn
if I want to kiss you!"</i>

56:54.400 --> 56:55.400
<i>But then you fast forward</i>

56:55.440 --> 56:56.576
<i>and they're all
into each other, right?</i>

56:56.600 --> 56:57.431
<i>And then Scotty's, like,</i>

56:57.520 --> 56:58.936
<i>"You know what?
I can't tell you this...</i>

56:58.960 --> 57:01.016
<i>"but I'm gonna go trash an
airport with Captain America."</i>

57:01.040 --> 57:02.776
<i>And then she said, "I can't
believe you split like that!</i>

57:02.800 --> 57:04.234
<i>"Smell you later, dummy."</i>

57:04.440 --> 57:05.616
So, Scotty goes
on house arrest.

57:05.640 --> 57:07.256
<i>And he won't admit it,
but his heart is all, like...</i>

57:07.280 --> 57:08.714
<i>"Damn! I thought
Hope coulda been</i>

57:08.800 --> 57:10.553
<i>"my new true partner,
but I blew it!"</i>

57:10.720 --> 57:11.856
<i>But fate brought 'em
back together.</i>

57:11.880 --> 57:12.976
And then Hope's heart
is all...

57:13.000 --> 57:14.593
<i>"I'm worried
that I can't trust him...</i>

57:14.760 --> 57:16.496
<i>"and he's gonna screw up
again, and ruin everything!"</i>

57:16.520 --> 57:17.800
And then
my heart is all, like...

57:17.880 --> 57:19.776
<i>"That fancy raspberry filling
represents the company's red</i>

57:19.800 --> 57:21.656
<i>"and we're days away from
going out of business. Oh!"</i>

57:21.680 --> 57:22.511
"Out of business"?

57:22.680 --> 57:23.680
"Days away"?

57:23.720 --> 57:24.720
Damn truth serum!

57:24.840 --> 57:26.911
I was trying to protect
you guys. I swear to God.

57:27.080 --> 57:28.960
I was trying to be
a good boss, but we're broke!

57:29.120 --> 57:29.951
And the Karapetyan's
our last hope.

57:30.040 --> 57:31.096
And if we don't show up,
we're done!

57:31.120 --> 57:32.236
That's terrible bossing!

57:32.400 --> 57:33.400
Damn, bro!

57:33.440 --> 57:35.120
- That's on me! That's on me!
- Hey!

57:35.560 --> 57:37.199
Enough.

57:39.480 --> 57:41.358
I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

57:42.600 --> 57:44.034
Where is Scott Lang?

57:44.200 --> 57:45.216
I've been trying to tell you,

57:45.240 --> 57:46.376
he's in a tricky spot,
emotionally speaking.

57:46.400 --> 57:47.720
Emotionally speaking.

57:47.880 --> 57:50.918
Well, where is Scott Lang,
literally speaking!

57:51.080 --> 57:52.355
Oh!
The woods.

57:52.520 --> 57:53.680
The woods?

57:53.960 --> 57:55.280
Baba Yaga!

57:56.320 --> 57:57.959
What do you mean, "the woods"?

57:58.160 --> 57:59.296
The Muir Woods,
the second fire road

57:59.320 --> 58:00.436
off the Panoramic Highway!

58:00.600 --> 58:01.716
For God's sake!

58:03.680 --> 58:05.399
<i>Baba Yaga, come at night</i>

58:05.560 --> 58:07.791
<i>Little children, sleepy tight</i>

58:10.120 --> 58:11.713
Damn it!

58:13.400 --> 58:14.800
If that freak
gets Pym's tech...

58:14.960 --> 58:16.474
I'm never gonna see it.

58:16.680 --> 58:17.716
So, what do we do now?

58:19.120 --> 58:20.759
It's easier to steal it
from the Feds

58:20.840 --> 58:22.160
than from the boogeyman.

58:24.680 --> 58:27.752
Hey, it's me. How'd you like
to get a promotion?

58:27.920 --> 58:31.630
I got the location on Pym,
Van Dyne and Lang.

58:31.800 --> 58:33.096
But you gonna
have to take 'em down now,

58:33.120 --> 58:34.873
because they ain't gonna
be there for long.

58:35.040 --> 58:37.077
And when you do,
you gonna get me that lab.

58:37.800 --> 58:39.393
Understood.

58:40.600 --> 58:42.193
Good news, gentlemen.

58:42.360 --> 58:44.556
Feds are gonna do
the hard work for us.

58:45.240 --> 58:47.118
What are you lookin' at?
Change my tires!

58:47.280 --> 58:48.280
Right.

58:50.320 --> 58:52.676
- Sir.
- Can you knock?

58:53.400 --> 58:55.915
Sorry, sir.
Uh, but I just got a lead.

58:57.160 --> 58:58.879
Ooh, I love leads.

59:05.680 --> 59:06.830
System's in the green.

59:07.000 --> 59:08.593
Priming the coils.

59:10.960 --> 59:11.996
Full charge.

59:12.160 --> 59:13.336
As soon
as the tunnel's open...

59:13.360 --> 59:14.496
let us know
if you get anything

59:14.520 --> 59:15.616
that could be a part of
her message.

59:15.640 --> 59:16.960
Yeah, yeah. I will.

59:19.120 --> 59:20.634
Okay, then.

59:23.280 --> 59:24.280
Here it goes.

59:38.160 --> 59:39.753
We did it!

59:40.280 --> 59:41.794
You got anything?

59:45.000 --> 59:46.000
Nothin'.

59:46.400 --> 59:48.790
Well, just give it a minute,
because it could...

59:50.120 --> 59:51.474
No.

59:51.640 --> 59:53.199
No, no, no, no!

59:53.400 --> 59:54.400
What's happening?

59:54.440 --> 59:56.240
It's shutting down.
Maybe our vectors are off.

59:56.320 --> 59:58.640
We've gone over them a million
times, I know they're right!

59:58.760 --> 59:59.816
Then what else
could it be?

59:59.840 --> 01:00:01.638
I don't know!

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:09.216
- Scott, what are you doing?
- Scott, get away from that!

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:10.240
Scott, you can't...

01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:12.040
I'm sorry, I don't know
how much time I have.

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:13.315
I need to fix the algorithm.

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:17.870
Trust me,
after 30 years down here...

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:19.713
I've thought about it a lot.

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:25.196
Janet?

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:29.440
Hi, honey.

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:34.400
Jellybean.

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:36.155
Mom?

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:38.799
It's not the reunion
I'd imagined.

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:40.713
It's all so rushed.

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:43.190
You two have done
such great work.

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:45.317
You just need a little...

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:46.995
nudge.

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.755
Janet,
how is this possible?

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:07.714
It wasn't a message you put

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:09.160
in Scott's head.
It was an antenna.

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:10.839
Clever girl.

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:13.317
I'm so proud of you.

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:15.193
Honey, tell us where you are.

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:16.959
Tell us how to find you.

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:18.952
No, the probability fields
are too complex.

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:20.480
That's why I needed
to talk to you.

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:22.040
You have to follow my voice.

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:23.550
Of course!

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:25.598
Like tracing a call
back to its source!

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:33.678
I'm tracking your signal
using subatomic frequencies...

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:36.116
between point two
and point nine.

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:37.794
I'd narrow it to four and six.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.256
That's too tight.
We could miss you.

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:40.873
Look at us squabbling again.

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:44.435
Fine. All right,
between three and seven.

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:47.997
Our first fight in decades,
and it's over just like that.

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:04.113
Bullseye.

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:05.875
Source lock.

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:07.554
It's you.

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:09.757
We got it!

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:12.471
You have to meet me
at these exact coordinates.

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:15.155
In the wasteland,
beyond the quantum void.

01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:16.470
It's very dangerous,

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:18.597
especially on the human mind,
so be careful.

01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:21.320
Time and space work very
differently down here.

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:22.880
You have two hours.

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.856
After that, the probability
fields will shift...

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:25.896
and it'll be another century

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.354
before they align
like this again.

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:29.512
We'll find you.

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:38.395
I know you will, Jellybean.

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:44.440
Nope.

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.432
Nothing. I got nothing.
No sign of Janet.

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:47.636
Perfect.

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:51.120
How did we get up here?

01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:57.816
All right, first you're gonna
see all kinds of lights...

01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:59.136
and it's gonna get
really trippy...

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:01.880
but then it's gonna turn black
and silent. Really silent.

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:03.480
Scott, I'll be fine.

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:05.296
I'm just saying
because I've been down there.

01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:06.640
Yeah, so you've mentioned.

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:11.712
Um, sorry.
I have to take this.

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:14.280
<i>Hey, man, you coming?</i>

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:16.040
No, I'm not,
but you know what? Ghost is.

01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:18.280
And you know what? The Feds,
they know where you are.

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:19.709
- What?
<i>- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</i>

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:21.256
Uh, they gave me
some truth serum.

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:22.077
And then all of a sudden

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:23.360
I started talkin'
all honestly.

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:25.176
Like, I hate the way
that you load the dishwasher.

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:26.429
<i>I hate it, I hate it.</i>

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:27.576
- Uh...
<i>- But you need to go home...</i>

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.216
because the Feds
are probably going there now!

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:30.240
And by the way...

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:32.875
who puts the plates on the top
rack? They don't go there!

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:43.920
I feel like such a jerk.

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:46.390
You're gonna be really mad.
We gotta go now.

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:47.560
What?

01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:49.711
Ghost knows where we are.
So does the FBI.

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:50.950
How?

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:53.032
- I told Luis where we are.
- You what?

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:54.256
I told him to come here
so I could help him

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:55.440
with the Karapetyan proposal.

01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:56.670
Oh, my God!

01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.834
Look, we need
to land that account.

01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:00.160
Otherwise,
we lose the business!

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:01.157
Do you know hard it is
for ex-cons

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:02.071
to find work these days?

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:03.640
Jesus, Scott!

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:14.760
90 seconds to close
the aperture!

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:16.673
You have to depolarize
the coils first!

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:17.557
I know!

01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:19.200
I'm really sorry...

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.515
but the, um, FBI
is coming to my place so...

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:24.160
I have to go.

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:27.599
Can I borrow the suit?

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.560
<i>Gyroscopic stabilizers.</i>

01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:32.354
<i>Powering on.</i>

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:34.438
I'm just gonna borrow
the suit.

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:36.877
I'll come back.
Just tell me where you'll be.

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.599
- Don't bother.
- What?

01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:39.896
We'll come
and get the suit from you,

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:41.120
as soon as we've found my mom.

01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:43.311
- Hope...
- Scott, just go!

01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:02.518
- Scott?
- Daddy?

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:03.750
It's us, buddy!

01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:06.156
We're here for Cassie's shoes!

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:07.676
He must be resting.

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:09.016
Honey, why don't you
go upstairs

01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:10.110
and look under your bed?

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:12.431
Daddy, you upstairs?

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:15.033
Daddy?

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:17.240
What the...

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:20.995
He really lives
like a pig these days.

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:25.395
Daddy?

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:34.633
Spread out!

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Again?

01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:37.360
You people have no shame!

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:39.496
The monitor says
that he's in the bathroom.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:40.520
Yeah, I'm not buying it!

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:45.192
Cassie, let the man get by!

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:46.919
But Daddy's super sick!

01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:48.275
I'll see about that!

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:50.320
He says he doesn't want
anyone else to get sick!

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:51.755
I'll take my chances, sweetie.

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:54.111
He barfed. Like, a lot.

01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:55.760
Young lady,
I'm a federal agent.

01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:57.912
I've seen worse things
than vomit.

01:05:58.720 --> 01:05:59.720
Like, "a lot" a lot?

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:01.599
- Yes!
- Forget it, move aside!

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:03.040
No!

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:08.511
Woo!

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:12.271
- What are you doing here?
- Scott.

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:16.440
I'm sorry,
I'm just really sick.

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:17.710
I told you.

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:19.197
Excuse me.

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:21.829
Sometimes you gotta just
get it out. You know?

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:23.315
Sorry.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.514
I'll start the van.

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:33.876
You get the lab.

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:38.198
Freeze!
You're surrounded!

01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:53.714
Hank Pym...

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:55.314
Hope Van Dyne...

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:56.630
you're under arrest.

01:06:58.640 --> 01:06:59.640
This is harassment!

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:00.796
Actually, it's not.

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:02.440
What does the FBI
even stand for...

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:04.956
"Forever
Bothering Individuals"?

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:08.477
- His monitor check out?
- Of course it does.

01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:10.349
Damn it!

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:12.910
Looks like I just got fed
a bowl of malarkey.

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:15.151
We got 'em sir. Pym
and Van Dyne are in custody.

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:17.474
Seriously? Yes!

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:20.520
Oh, I'm sorry, Scott.

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:22.313
They're your friends.
That's insensitive.

01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:24.754
I just really needed a win,
you know?

01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:26.400
Anyway, I'll be back later

01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:28.000
for the official end
of your sentence!

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:29.879
Sorry for misjudging you, pal!

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:32.077
You should feel great
about yourself!

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:56.960
What is it?

01:07:57.120 --> 01:07:58.216
We have a man down.

01:07:58.240 --> 01:07:59.993
And Pym's lab is gone.

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:09.240
Hey.

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:12.839
Thanks for covering for me.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.036
Sure.

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:18.075
So...

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:21.359
how long
have you been Ant-Man again?

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:26.594
Not long.

01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:28.433
It just sort of happened.

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:30.273
I'm sorry for lying to you...

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:32.158
and I'm sorry
for risking everything.

01:08:32.319 --> 01:08:33.319
Daddy, it's okay.

01:08:33.399 --> 01:08:34.515
It's not.

01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:36.960
I do some dumb things...

01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:39.395
and the people that I love
the most pay the price.

01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:40.560
Mainly you.

01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:42.991
Trying to help people
isn't dumb.

01:08:45.319 --> 01:08:47.437
I screw it up
just about every time.

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:50.837
So, maybe you just need
someone watching your back...

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.229
like a partner.

01:08:52.439 --> 01:08:53.317
Well, she's made it clear

01:08:53.439 --> 01:08:54.895
that's about the last thing
she wants.

01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:56.036
Who?

01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:57.520
Hope.

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:01.274
Wait, who did you think?

01:09:01.439 --> 01:09:02.439
Me.

01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:03.876
You?

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:05.554
Don't laugh.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.399
I'd be a great partner.

01:09:07.479 --> 01:09:09.278
Aw, peanut.

01:09:09.359 --> 01:09:13.639
Aw. You would be awesome.
And if I let you...

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:16.031
I would be a terrible dad.

01:09:16.359 --> 01:09:17.680
Fine.

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:20.560
Then have Hope be
your partner. She's smart.

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:23.799
She reminds me of you.

01:09:24.479 --> 01:09:26.437
You gonna go help her?

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:28.638
I think you should help her.

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:30.792
I wish I could...

01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:34.519
but I don't know how I could
help her without hurting you.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:39.399
You can do it.

01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:41.796
You can do anything.

01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:44.993
You are the world's
greatest grandma.

01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:54.518
Agent Woo will see you
in an hour.

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:56.637
An hour?
We don't have an hour.

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:59.076
Oh, you got
somewhere else to be?

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:08.956
Oh, now, that's my girl.

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:17.511
All right, what's our plan?

01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:20.879
To shrink that wall.

01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:22.276
It looks load-bearing.

01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:23.590
The ceiling could collapse.

01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:25.274
Then we run like hell.

01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:27.591
Now, I estimate 15-20 agents
on the floor.

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:29.680
Roughly five times that
in the building at large.

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:31.080
They're all heavily armed.

01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:32.356
Not great odds.

01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:34.196
You got any better ideas?

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:35.360
Nope.

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:38.112
And I'm not giving up on Mom.

01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:40.233
She'd be so proud of you.

01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:46.640
Okay.

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:48.960
One...

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:50.680
two...

01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:56.840
Scott?

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.736
What're you two
just standing around for?

01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:00.194
We gotta go find that lab.

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:02.155
What about me?

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:04.715
Perfect.

01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:06.840
Hurry up and get dressed.
We don't have much time.

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:21.434
Okay, now what?

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:23.159
You're asking me?

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:26.950
Get in!

01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:33.400
Hi.

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:34.920
Hi.

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:40.673
Uh, excuse me. Are we planning
on leaving soon...

01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:42.736
or are you two gonna keep
staring at each other...

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:44.672
until they start shooting
at us?

01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:46.594
Yeah.

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:52.680
- Hey, Burch.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:53.840
Yeah, they're out.

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:55.274
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:01.600
Her suit is missing,
and so is the van.

01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:02.790
How could this happen?

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.673
I mean, what the dickens?

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.480
Thank you.

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:10.476
You're welcome.

01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:14.595
So, uh, how do we find
the lab?

01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:16.080
After we lost it
the first time...

01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:18.959
I put on a new tracker...

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:20.793
of sorts.

01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:31.240
That'll work.

01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:59.759
Is it ready or not?

01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:02.795
We can begin
the extraction process.

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:04.880
Listen, Ava.

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:06.759
This whole thing
could be very dangerous.

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:08.750
Maybe we should...

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:11.480
Maybe we should what? Wait?

01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:13.757
I've got days until I'm dead.

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:17.430
We're doing this, Bill. Now.

01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:23.592
Energy readings show they
have not used the tunnel yet.

01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:24.960
We don't have much time before

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:26.296
Mom's location shifts,
and we lose her.

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:28.152
Yeah, and we have
a lot to do before then.

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:30.296
You know,
my pep-pep always said,

01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:32.296
"If you want to do something
right, you make a list."

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:33.470
So, we should do that.

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:35.791
One, we have to break
into that lab.

01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:38.395
Two, we have to kick out
Foster and Ghost.

01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:40.717
Three, we're gonna
have to fight Ghost.

01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:43.270
That seems like it should be
part of two. 2-A, all right?

01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:44.994
Let's call it 2-A.

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:46.514
Fight Ghost. 2-A.

01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:48.256
Oh, also, we have to make sure
that the lab

01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:49.680
is fully grown
for you to come back.

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:50.760
Otherwise, we're screwed.

01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:51.637
Scott!

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:52.816
You want me to start again?
I'll start again...

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:54.559
I'm going to dive.

01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:58.560
The only chance we got is if
the two of you are out here...

01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:01.758
together,
protecting the tunnel.

01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:04.750
Let me do this, Hope. Please.

01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:08.311
Let me get her.

01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:11.597
I think he's right.

01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:20.911
"Whassup?"

01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:25.630
You don't remember, uh,
that beloved commercial?

01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:27.714
"Whassup?"

01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:30.553
I had him follow us.

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:33.599
I thought we could use
some help.

01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:36.400
All right.
I'm in position.

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:37.596
The ants are headed in.

01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:38.955
<i>Copy that.</i>

01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:40.440
<i>Keep your eyes peeled,
Scotty.</i>

01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:43.236
- Do you want Pez?
- No.

01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:45.479
Cassie gave me this
for my birthday.

01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:48.077
By the way, I love that suit!

01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:50.193
Thanks, man.

01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:53.275
I wish I had a suit.

01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:57.559
I would even like a suit
with minimal powers, you know?

01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:01.390
Or maybe even just a suit,
with no powers.

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:17.360
What is it?

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:20.037
Don't know.

01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:25.076
It's them!

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.070
They can't be far.

01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:52.839
All right, Hank. Hank?

01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:56.674
Dad, what's your status?

01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:58.752
Foster's taken care of.

01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:00.479
Suiting up now.

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:06.633
I just wanted to save Ava.

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:09.440
She's facing death or
something far more terrible.

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:10.636
She's afraid.

01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:14.553
I'll help you find a cure
when I get back.

01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:16.319
I promise.

01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:18.995
Together, we'll figure
something out.

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:22.713
Good luck, Hank.

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:24.839
Thanks, Bill.

01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:28.194
Now, I'm gonna need you
to step back.

01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:48.711
<i>Time remaining, 15 minutes.</i>

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:51.680
<i>Hank's in, Scott.</i>

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:52.840
<i>Any sign of her?</i>

01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:54.076
No, nothing yet.

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:01.230
Ava!

01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:06.117
Call off the ants, Scott.

01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:07.430
Oh, boy!

01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:32.296
Can I get a status report?

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:34.120
'Cause I got some
serious Ghost problems here!

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:38.430
Ready to dive.

01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:47.192
- In case I don't make it...
<i>- Don't.</i>

01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:48.954
Don't say that.

01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:51.312
<i>I can't lose you, too.</i>

01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:52.795
I love you, Hope.

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:56.631
Guys,
everything's bad over here.

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:13.840
Now.

01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:24.989
Misdirection.

01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:26.736
One of the first things
they teach you

01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:29.116
at Online Close-up
Magic University.

01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:32.080
No!

01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:36.954
Plan worked.
We got it, Scotty!

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.216
Meet us
at the rendezvous point.

01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:40.560
Okay, on my way!

01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:41.720
Oh, no.

01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:47.830
Really?
This guy again?

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.116
Who?

01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:51.272
I told you
our business wasn't over.

01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:54.549
Change of plans.

01:18:58.200 --> 01:18:59.200
Hang on.

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:10.352
I want that lab, boys,
whatever it takes.

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:21.240
Hold on.

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:36.633
That undercarriage is filthy!

01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:38.234
Oh, they got bigger problems.

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:44.816
Hope, what're you doing?

01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:46.216
You're heading away
from the rendezvous point!

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:47.310
<i>Don't worry,</i>

01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:48.616
<i>I'm taking these guys
on the scenic route.</i>

01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:50.711
Wait, what're you... Oh.

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:12.357
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
We're gonna die!

01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:14.634
We're gonna die!

01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:28.557
<i>Signal lost.</i>

01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:31.070
What the hell
are they doing up there?

01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:35.074
<i>Recalibrating.</i>

01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:52.198
<i>Recalibrating.</i>

01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:57.156
You never said
it was so beautiful, Scott.

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:03.913
<i>Recalibrating.</i>

01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:09.757
Okay, any time now.

01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:12.157
<i>Recalibrating.</i>

01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:16.679
<i>- Recalibrating.</i>
- Come on.

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:19.790
<i>Signal restored.</i>

01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:34.114
Bikes, it's all you.

01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:39.473
- Take the wheel.
- What? Wait! Whoa.

01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:52.600
Well, the 60's were fun,
but now I'm paying for it.

01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:54.234
Be careful up there!

01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:56.471
Hey, give me a break!
I haven't driven in two years!

01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:27.674
Oh, you got pezed!

01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:31.080
Up here!

01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:35.280
Oh, that's not good.

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:40.393
Hope!

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:46.920
- No!
- No!

01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:53.536
There it is, right there.
Get the lab!

01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:54.596
Get the lab!

01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:05.911
I've got her.
Westbound on Fremont.

01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:10.751
Hope! Wait!

01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:12.440
Hey, what about me?

01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:22.515
We got you now, Ava!

01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:25.231
Whoa! Oh!

01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:50.314
Not again!

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.400
Piece of junk!

01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:58.280
Ah! Yes!

01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:02.233
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:06.117
Burch got the lab.

01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:08.399
I'm going after him.

01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:19.120
No, no, no,
no, no, no!

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.639
Work in progress, my ass...

01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:40.216
<i>Scott, where are you?</i>

01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:41.754
<i>I've got Burch in my sights.
Hurry!</i>

01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:43.136
I'm coming,
I'm coming, I'm coming!

01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:44.719
<i>We're running
out of time.</i>

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:50.515
<i>Warning,
approaching quantum void.</i>

01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:17.952
I'm coming to you, honey.

01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:06.069
Guys.

01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:09.233
Don't you need the remote
to the lab? I just found it.

01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:10.656
We can't grow
the lab without it.

01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:11.830
Get it to us fast.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.120
Yeah, but the van is busted.

01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:14.760
Use the Hot Wheels Rally case.

01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:18.600
What?

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.957
I love you, Dr. Pym.

01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:27.496
The remote!
We're missing the remote!

01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:28.520
<i>You gotta check the van!</i>

01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:33.076
Huh?

01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:38.080
Awesome!

01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:06.336
Hey, I'm going down Pacific.

01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:07.555
<i>Burch's boys are all over me.</i>

01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:08.790
I'm on my way.

01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:10.997
Right. I'll get the lab.

01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:15.480
Hi.

01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:18.156
Oh, that's badass!

01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:28.195
Nice.

01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:38.480
Doink!

01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:45.714
Come here, you little weasel!

01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:47.599
No, you don't!

01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:52.631
I guess maybe you do.

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:54.871
Come on!

01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:09.352
Anyone see a Southern
gentleman carrying a building?

01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:15.996
How'd he even have time
to buy a ticket?

01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:19.120
Would you just one time,

01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:20.600
please work!

01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:22.680
Yes!

01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:24.156
All right, I need help.

01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:26.430
Yes!

01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:29.670
Oh. Sorry. Ah...

01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:31.640
Somebody!

01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:33.194
Hey! Come on, man!

01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:35.720
Not cool!

01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:37.075
Murderers!

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.720
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:44.919
I'm gonna call you
Ant-onio Banderas!

01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:46.400
You're a badass!

01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:48.360
Yes!

01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:51.875
No, no, no!

01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:53.633
Ant-onio!

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:57.656
<i>Our friends, the humpbacks,</i>

01:28:57.680 --> 01:28:59.558
<i>dip in here
to the San Francisco Bay...</i>

01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:01.757
<i>for a little leisure
and a little breeding.</i>

01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:03.115
Listen, Uzman...

01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:05.640
<i>And perhaps they're down below
as we speak, doing the nasty.</i>

01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:07.239
Just meet me
at the waterfront.

01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:08.476
In three hours.

01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:09.936
<i>Oh, folks.
We've barely left the dock...</i>

01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:11.758
<i>but it looks like
we got some company.</i>

01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:16.016
<i>Look. Right there.
Do you see it, folks?</i>

01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:18.236
<i>There it is.
There's a breach.</i>

01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:20.755
What the...?

01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:28.600
Hi. Sorry. Hi.

01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:30.996
It's okay. It's okay!

01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:33.755
Sorry, I know I'm not a whale.
This will just take a second.

01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:35.991
Hey! That doesn't belong
to you!

01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:37.640
No, no! No, no!

01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:38.896
You're embarrassing
yourself now.

01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:41.833
Come on. Let go.

01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:42.920
Thank you.

01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:47.119
I'll take this now.

01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:04.319
<i>It melts your mind.</i>

01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:07.680
<i>A message in your head.</i>

01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:11.190
<i>I had a dream.</i>

01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:13.033
<i>Daddy?
Where's Mommy?</i>

01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:14.776
<i>It's where I hid
every time that we played.</i>

01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:15.836
<i>I love you, Hank.</i>

01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:33.635
Daddy?

01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:39.435
Daddy?

01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:45.279
Dad?
What's going on?

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:46.590
Why haven't you found Mom?

01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:51.520
You look lost, Hank.
Are you all right?

01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:55.910
Still think you have
all the answers, Hank?

01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:53.598
It's me.

01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:09.037
I'm so sorry...

01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:12.549
it took so long.

01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:13.995
No.

01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:16.796
No.

01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:19.034
You're here now.

01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:21.800
Let's go home.

01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:25.480
I thought I was gone.

01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:29.239
But that energy
from your hands...

01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:30.834
how did you do that?

01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:36.639
I'm not the same woman I was
30 years ago, Henry.

01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:38.280
This place...

01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:41.277
it changes you.

01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:46.272
Adaptation is part of it,
but some of it is...

01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:47.635
evolution.

01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:52.191
<i>Lab coordinates not found.</i>

01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:53.715
<i>Do not ascend.</i>

01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:56.120
I should probably tell you

01:32:56.200 --> 01:32:58.112
what we're dealing with
up there.

01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:02.600
I got the lab. I got the lab.

01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:05.076
Move.
Move.

01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:07.712
Move!

01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:10.032
Get out of the way.

01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:16.790
Let's go.

01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:22.070
<i>No one here appears
to be sure what this is.</i>

01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:25.114
<i>It's gotta be 80-85 feet tall.</i>

01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:32.032
Get out of the way!

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:36.072
I got the lab.

01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:39.155
The air feels chunky.

01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:40.879
Oh, no. He's too big.

01:33:44.840 --> 01:33:45.840
Scotty!

01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:46.960
Scott!

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:48.832
I'm gonna go to sleep.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.879
I'm just gonna go to sleep now
for five minutes.

01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:53.554
I just need five minutes.

01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:56.036
Five minutes!

01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:04.435
You get the lab
somewhere safe.

01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:07.195
- Scott's air won't last.
- Okay.

01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:22.951
Move!

01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:25.919
Move! Move!

01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:28.880
No, wait!

01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:41.959
<i>Lab at full scale.</i>

01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:43.280
They did it.

01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:44.680
<i>Ready to ascend.</i>

01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:46.439
Let's go see our daughter.

01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:09.916
Scott!

01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:12.794
Scott!

01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:14.997
Scott, come on, wake up!

01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:31.635
Come on.
Come on, where are you, Scott?

01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:35.114
Gotcha.

01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:40.430
Scott?

01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:48.718
Hey.

01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:53.629
Hey, Scotty!
Hope, come in.

01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:55.632
Did you get crushed
by the building?

01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:00.240
Where's the remote, Luis?

01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:02.553
It's probably in there.

01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:04.680
I don't have it.
I don't have it.

01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:06.639
I guess
this is where we say...

01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:08.754
<i>Adiós, amigo.</i>

01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:10.920
No, no, no, no!

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Thanks, guys.

01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:22.720
Ava?

01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:24.880
Ava!

01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:29.240
Ava!

01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:30.754
Almost ready for extraction.

01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:33.151
Please, stop!
People are getting hurt!

01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:35.835
Everything hurts.
Don't talk to me about pain!

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.593
What if Hank is right?

01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:39.399
What if this process
kills Janet?

01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:40.829
What, you're worried
about her?

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.040
All I'm saying is that she is
a brilliant scientist.

01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:44.275
She may be able to help.

01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:46.915
Oh, she will help. Right now!

01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:48.912
And if she dies, she dies!

01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:51.800
No, no. I'm sorry,
we can't do this.

01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:53.952
We have to find another way.

01:36:57.120 --> 01:36:59.112
This is the way.

01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:21.515
Janet!

01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:33.760
She started
the extraction.

01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:35.792
She's gonna tear Mom apart.

01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:45.960
No!

01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:21.480
Hope!

01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:39.510
Are you okay?

01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:56.238
Mom?

01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:05.760
Oh, my God.

01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:12.273
We found you.

01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:17.873
I missed you so much.

01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:20.796
I missed you too, Jellybean.

01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:24.516
It's okay.

01:39:24.680 --> 01:39:27.673
I'm here now.
We have time.

01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:31.711
No more last-minute
business trips, okay?

01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:34.112
I promise.

01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:35.320
No, it's okay!

01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:37.233
It's all right.
Just don't worry about me.

01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:39.153
- I'll be fine.
- Dad.

01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:45.879
Scott.

01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:47.719
Miss Van Dyne.

01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:50.913
It's nice to...

01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:52.514
Well, I guess
we've already met.

01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:55.070
Yeah. I guess we have.

01:39:58.280 --> 01:39:59.280
Wait.

01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:08.994
Your pain.

01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:12.200
I can feel it.

01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:16.035
It hurts.

01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:20.038
It always hurts.

01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:24.474
I'm sorry.

01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:29.671
I think I can help you.

01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:05.917
Did you know
she could do that?

01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:10.759
It's okay.

01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:14.600
Guys, the cops are coming!

01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:15.960
Whoa.

01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:20.874
The cops are coming.
Like, all of 'em!

01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:23.152
- I gotta go.
- We gotta go!

01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:25.509
What about them?

01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:30.317
Hands in the air!

01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:32.716
- No! We are going to our jobs.
- No.

01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:35.056
You see, we see these guys.
They trying to shoot people.

01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:38.312
So we apprehended them.
For you. You're welcome.

01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:40.472
We traffic
in stolen technology.

01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:42.518
And we have killed many,
many people.

01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:44.160
Uh, he's in charge.

01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:45.320
That's true, I am.

01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:47.230
I've also committed

01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:49.516
numerous health code
violations in my restaurant.

01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:51.876
Some of them would shock you.

01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:57.190
It is truth serum.

01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:02.793
We gotta get outta here.

01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:04.519
Fast.

01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:07.200
I have an idea.

01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:09.016
<i>Giant figure, now spotted</i>

01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:10.496
<i>at the intersection of
Broadway and Laguna.</i>

01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:11.556
<i>All units move in.</i>

01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:13.080
Go, go!

01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:17.594
There he is!

01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:24.280
It's over, Scotty!

01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:26.557
I'm sorry,
but we got you, man!

01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:29.232
Come on.
It's the end of the line, pal.

01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:30.720
There's nowhere to hide.

01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:35.638
Just pull off that Band-Aid!
You lost! It's okay!

01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:39.829
Damn it, Scotty,
reduce yourself!

01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:47.519
Magic.

01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:50.720
Damn it!

01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:52.633
Get to Lang's, now!

01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:00.992
Well done, honey.

01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:02.639
Let's go!

01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:11.760
Leave me here.

01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:13.036
We can make it.

01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:14.270
You said it yourself.

01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:17.672
I've hurt people.

01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:19.513
But you haven't.

01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:21.239
Go. Please!

01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:22.675
We can make it, Ava.

01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:24.600
Bill...

01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:26.839
I'm not leaving you.

01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:12.074
Oh, hey, guys.

01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:14.352
Are my two years up already?

01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:23.038
What's it like out there?

01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:26.272
Huh? I mean,
do people still dance?

01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:28.511
Are food trucks still a thing?

01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:30.480
Well, you got away with it
this time, Scott...

01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:33.838
but, uh,
I'll be seeing you again.

01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:35.280
Where?

01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:37.031
Huh?

01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:38.713
Where will you be
seeing me again?

01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:43.031
Like, in general...

01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:45.032
The next time
you do something bad,

01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:46.560
- I'll be there to catch you...
- Oh.

01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:48.632
You'll be watching...

01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:51.230
I thought you were
inviting me somewhere.

01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:53.633
Why would I do that?

01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:56.276
That's what I was wondering,
why would you do that?

01:44:56.440 --> 01:44:58.096
Like a party, or like,
dinner or something?

01:44:58.120 --> 01:45:00.032
I don't know. I thought you
planned the evening.

01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:01.536
I meant, "I'll arrest you
later, again."

01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:02.840
Of course,
that would be strange.

01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:04.718
- Take it easy, Jimmy.
- Okay.

01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:07.336
Did you want to grab dinner,
or something?

01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:09.511
I mean, because I'm free...

01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:11.000
Yeah. Come on.

01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:21.351
You ready?

01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:22.520
Yeah!

01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:26.198
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi.

01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:28.595
Oh!

01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:31.750
Yes, that was us.
How can I help you?

01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:33.400
X-Con Security.

01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:35.960
Mr. Karapetyan?

01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:37.760
Yeah, you saw that?

01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:42.714
It would be an honor to be
in business with you as well.

01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:44.394
I'll see you Thursday,
9:00 AM. Okay.

01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:46.200
Yeah!

01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:49.280
That's how you close a deal!

01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:19.119
This is awesome.

01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:21.240
So, Cassie...

01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:22.993
what do you want to be
when you grow up?

01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:25.232
I wanna help people...

01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:26.556
like my dad.

01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:28.560
Really?

01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:31.559
I wanted to be his partner.

01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:33.319
But he said he wants you.

01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:35.515
Is that so?

01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:41.554
Daddy!

01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:44.073
Whoa! Hold on.

01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:46.158
Move, get outta here!

01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:48.160
Scott, don't, don't, don't!

01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:50.511
Ow.

01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:52.393
Oh, gross!

01:46:52.520 --> 01:46:54.796
Ugh. I hate that moth dust!

01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:58.915
Go! Shoo! Shoo!

01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:08.157
I used to be
a respected scientist.

01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:11.273
I had my name
on the sides of buildings.

01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:12.836
Now, I got this.

01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:16.559
Well, you wanted
a smaller quantum tunnel.

01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:19.315
This is... smaller.

01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:23.997
Oh. Sorry. My bad.

01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:25.992
Ah, I think it has flair.

01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:29.438
All right. Control's online.

01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:34.951
The collection unit activates
when you decouple it.

01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:36.958
It should automatically
start absorbing

01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:38.315
quantum healing particles.

01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:41.440
Also, make sure you stay
out of the tardigrade fields.

01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:42.960
They're cute,
but they'll eat you.

01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:45.072
And don't get sucked
into a time vortex.

01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:46.320
We won't be able to save you.

01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:50.720
Okay.

01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:53.154
Going subatomic in five...

01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:55.480
four...

01:49:56.040 --> 01:49:57.040
three...

01:49:57.480 --> 01:49:58.480
two...

01:49:58.720 --> 01:49:59.720
one.

01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:05.800
All right, Scott,
this is a mic check.

01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:12.792
<i>Mic check, one, two.
One, two.</i>

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.469
<i>How's everybody doing tonight
in the quantum realm?</i>

01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:16.756
Scott, we read you.

01:50:16.960 --> 01:50:18.519
I just wanna
make sure.

01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:25.156
Okay.

01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:28.074
Healing particles secured
for our new Ghost friend.

01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:29.240
<i>Great.</i>

01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:30.999
<i>Preparing for re-entry in...</i>

01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:33.760
<i>five, four, three...</i>

01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:38.640
Hello?

01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:41.717
Ha, ha. Very funny.

01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:43.234
Hank, quit screwing around.

01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:45.756
You told me yourself
not to screw around.

01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:47.600
<i>Hank?</i>

01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:50.276
<i>Hope?</i>

01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:51.880
<i>Janet.</i>

01:50:53.120 --> 01:50:54.120
<i>Guys.</i>

01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:56.919
<i>Guys.</i>

01:50:57.520 --> 01:50:59.000
<i>Okay, seriously,
don't joke around.</i>

01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:00.275
<i>Bring me up, let's go.</i>

01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:01.720
<i>Guys!</i>
