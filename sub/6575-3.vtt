00:12.590 --> 00:14.958
Ohh!

00:21.800 --> 00:23.000
- You again!

00:23.068 --> 00:24.968
I'm startin' to get insulted
Green Arrow's

00:25.036 --> 00:28.072
Not messin' up
my operations personally.

00:34.846 --> 00:37.614
Uhh!

00:37.682 --> 00:41.018
Do you know what I pay
for a suit in my size?!

00:41.086 --> 00:43.253
Scorch the Earth, boys.

00:43.321 --> 00:44.721
- Uhh!
- Unh!

00:44.789 --> 00:47.157
Ohh!

01:00.805 --> 01:01.738
- Hyah!

01:03.341 --> 01:04.608
- The cave is perfect.

01:04.676 --> 01:06.944
It has everything
the team will need.

01:07.011 --> 01:09.279
- For covert missions,
you know, spy stuff.

01:09.347 --> 01:11.548
- And wait till you see Superboy
and Miss Martian.

01:11.616 --> 01:12.816
But I saw her first.

01:16.754 --> 01:17.921
- Hahh!

01:22.393 --> 01:23.594
- Heh heh.

01:23.661 --> 01:27.631
Tell Arrow he shouldn't
send boys to do a man's job.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.702
Go ahead.

01:39.244 --> 01:43.113
- High-density
polyurethane foam. Nice.

01:43.181 --> 01:45.649
- So, Speedy, you in?

01:46.651 --> 01:47.851
- Pass.

01:47.919 --> 01:51.088
I'm done letting Arrow and
the League tell me what to do.

01:51.156 --> 01:53.590
I don't need a baby sitter
or a clubhouse

01:53.658 --> 01:55.626
To hang out
with the other kids.

01:55.693 --> 01:57.794
Your Junior Justice League
is a joke,

01:57.862 --> 02:02.199
Something to keep you busy
and in your place.

02:02.267 --> 02:04.334
I don't want any part of it.

02:32.964 --> 02:37.167
Robin, b01;

02:37.235 --> 02:41.538
Kid Flash, b03.

02:50.615 --> 02:52.449
- Did you ask him?
What did he say?

02:52.517 --> 02:54.051
- He's arriving now.

02:54.118 --> 02:56.086
- Then what are we waiting for?

03:16.641 --> 03:18.709
- Red Tornado!

03:19.711 --> 03:20.844
- Greetings.

03:20.912 --> 03:23.814
Is there a reason you
intercept me outside the cave?

03:23.881 --> 03:26.049
- We hoped you had
a mission for us.

03:26.117 --> 03:28.852
- Mission assignments are
the Batman's responsibility.

03:28.920 --> 03:31.088
- But it's been over a week,
and nothing--

03:31.155 --> 03:32.522
- You'll be tested soon enough.

03:32.590 --> 03:35.525
For the time being, simply enjoy
each other's company.

03:35.593 --> 03:37.861
- This team is not
a social club.

03:37.929 --> 03:41.064
- No, but I am told
social interaction

03:41.132 --> 03:43.767
Is an important
team-building exercise.

03:43.835 --> 03:48.972
Perhaps you can keep busy by
familiarizing yourself with the cave.

03:50.108 --> 03:51.174
- "Keep busy."

03:51.242 --> 03:53.043
- Does he think
we're falling for this?

03:53.111 --> 03:54.411
- Oh, I'll find out.

03:58.349 --> 04:01.451
Red Tornado, 1-6.

04:01.519 --> 04:03.787
I'm sorry.

04:03.855 --> 04:06.323
I forgot he's a machine,
inorganic.

04:06.391 --> 04:08.692
I cannot read his mind.

04:08.760 --> 04:09.926
- Nice try, though.

04:09.994 --> 04:13.297
So, uh, you know what
I'm thinkin' right now?

04:13.364 --> 04:15.432
- We all know
what you're thinkin' now.

04:15.500 --> 04:16.666
- Ow.

04:17.869 --> 04:20.570
- And now we tour the clubhouse.

04:20.637 --> 04:22.572
- Well, Superboy and I
live here.

04:22.640 --> 04:24.174
We can play tour guides.

04:24.242 --> 04:25.475
- Don't look at me.

04:25.543 --> 04:28.612
- We won't. A private tour
sounds much more fun.

04:28.680 --> 04:30.380
- Sh-she never said private.

04:30.448 --> 04:33.450
- Team building. We'll all go.

04:35.520 --> 04:36.453
- Unh!

04:36.521 --> 04:39.456
- So this would be
our front door...

04:39.524 --> 04:41.491
And this would be the back.

04:41.559 --> 04:44.127
The cave is actually
the entire mountain.

04:44.195 --> 04:45.529
- It was hollowed out
and reinforced

04:45.596 --> 04:48.298
By Superman and Green Lantern
in the early days of the League.

04:48.366 --> 04:51.201
- Then why abandon it
for the hall of justice?

04:51.269 --> 04:54.137
- The cave's secret location
was compromised.

04:54.205 --> 04:57.140
- So they traded it in
for a tourist trap?

04:57.208 --> 04:58.475
Yeah. That makes sense.

04:58.543 --> 05:00.477
- If villains know of the cave,

05:00.545 --> 05:02.045
We must be on constant alert.

05:02.113 --> 05:04.848
- The bad guys know we know
they know about the place,

05:04.916 --> 05:06.416
So they'd never think
to look here.

05:06.484 --> 05:09.086
- Uh, he means
we're hiding in plain sight.

05:09.153 --> 05:11.154
- Ah, that's much clearer.

05:12.523 --> 05:13.590
I smell smoke.

05:13.658 --> 05:15.859
My cookies!

05:26.003 --> 05:29.439
I was trying out grammy Jones
recipe from episode 17 of--

05:29.507 --> 05:30.374
Heh. Never mind.

05:30.441 --> 05:32.342
- I bet they'd have
tasted great.

05:32.410 --> 05:34.111
He doesn't seem to mind.

05:36.114 --> 05:39.182
I have a serious metabolism.

05:39.250 --> 05:41.618
- I'll make more?

05:41.686 --> 05:43.787
- It was sweet of you
to make any.

05:43.855 --> 05:44.721
- Thanks, Aqualad.

05:44.789 --> 05:46.056
- We're off duty.

05:46.124 --> 05:47.124
Call me Kaldur'ahm.

05:47.191 --> 05:49.826
Actually, my friends
call me Kaldur.

05:49.894 --> 05:53.663
- I'm Wally. See? I already
trust you with my secret I.D.,

05:53.731 --> 05:55.899
Unlike Mr. Dark Glasses
over here.

05:55.967 --> 05:59.336
Batman's forbidden Boy Wonder
from telling anyone his real name.

05:59.404 --> 06:00.704
- Mine's no secret.

06:00.772 --> 06:02.439
It's M'gann M'orzz.

06:02.507 --> 06:04.307
Like, you can call me Megan.

06:04.375 --> 06:07.677
It's an Earth name,
and I'm on Earth now.

06:09.414 --> 06:10.647
Don't worry, Superboy.

06:12.750 --> 06:15.085
- We'll find you
an Earth name, too.

06:15.153 --> 06:17.087
- Get out of my head!

06:18.089 --> 06:20.290
- What's wrong?
I don't understand.

06:20.358 --> 06:22.993
Everyone on Mars
communicates telepathically.

06:23.060 --> 06:24.828
- M'gann, stop.

06:26.063 --> 06:28.131
Things are different on Earth.

06:28.199 --> 06:31.067
Here, your powers are
an extreme invasion of privacy.

06:31.135 --> 06:33.336
- Besides, cadmus' creepy
little psychic genomes

06:33.404 --> 06:35.605
Left a bad taste in his brain.

06:35.673 --> 06:37.107
- I--I didn't mean to--

06:37.175 --> 06:40.043
- Just stay out.

06:44.348 --> 06:45.315
- Hello, Megan.

06:45.383 --> 06:47.551
I know what we can do.

06:55.293 --> 06:57.427
Superboy, please.

06:57.495 --> 06:59.296
- Don't talk to me.

07:10.741 --> 07:12.909
- It's my martian bioship.

07:16.948 --> 07:17.881
- Cute.

07:17.949 --> 07:20.116
Not aerodynamic, but cute.

07:20.184 --> 07:22.352
- It's at rest, silly.

07:22.420 --> 07:23.653
I'll wake it.

07:33.531 --> 07:35.732
Well, are you coming?

07:41.606 --> 07:43.740
Strap in for launch.

07:43.808 --> 07:46.142
- Whoa.

07:46.210 --> 07:48.011
- Cool.

07:48.079 --> 07:51.681
- Red Tornado,
please open the bay doors.

08:03.160 --> 08:04.694
- Incredible.

08:04.762 --> 08:07.197
She sure is.

08:07.265 --> 08:08.532
I--I mean the ship,

08:08.599 --> 08:10.867
Which, like all ships, is a she.

08:10.935 --> 08:13.703
- Fast with his feet,
not so much with his mouth.

08:13.771 --> 08:15.505
- Dude!

08:15.573 --> 08:17.407
- I may not have psychic powers,

08:17.475 --> 08:19.709
But I can guess
what you're thinking.

08:19.777 --> 08:22.746
You overreacted, and you
don't know how to apologize.

08:22.813 --> 08:24.748
Just say sorry.

08:28.819 --> 08:29.786
- He'll come around.

08:29.854 --> 08:32.155
- He doesn't seem
to like me much.

08:32.222 --> 08:35.592
- You guys remember he
has super hearing, right?

08:37.761 --> 08:40.897
- Hey, how 'bout showing us
a little martian shape-shifting?

08:49.707 --> 08:52.208
- Is it wrong
that I think I'm hot?

08:52.276 --> 08:53.610
- Impressive,

08:53.678 --> 08:57.314
But you know you're not exactly
gonna fool anyone with those.

08:57.381 --> 09:00.016
- Mimicking boys
is a lot harder.

09:00.084 --> 09:01.651
- And your clothes?

09:01.719 --> 09:03.587
- They're organic,
like the ship.

09:03.654 --> 09:05.789
They respond
to my mental commands.

09:05.856 --> 09:08.358
- As long as they're
the only ones.

09:08.426 --> 09:12.095
- Can you do that ghosting through
walls thing that manhunter does?

09:12.163 --> 09:14.364
- Density shifting?

09:14.432 --> 09:17.601
No. I-it's a very
advanced technique.

09:17.668 --> 09:20.604
- Flash can vibrate his
molecules right through a wall.

09:20.671 --> 09:23.540
Heh heh heh. When he tries it,
bloody nose.

09:23.608 --> 09:24.674
- Dude!

09:24.742 --> 09:26.643
- Here's something I can do.

09:28.212 --> 09:30.814
Camouflage mode.

09:30.881 --> 09:32.482
- Red Tornado to Miss Martian.

09:32.550 --> 09:34.451
An emergency alert
has been triggered

09:34.518 --> 09:36.386
At the Happy Harbor power plant.

09:36.454 --> 09:39.022
I suggest
you investigate covertly.

09:39.090 --> 09:40.790
I'm sending coordinates.

09:40.858 --> 09:43.193
- Received. Adjusting course.

09:43.260 --> 09:45.795
- Tornado's
keeping us busy again.

09:45.863 --> 09:48.765
- Well, a simple fire
led you to Superboy.

09:48.833 --> 09:51.635
We should find out
what caused the alert.

09:51.702 --> 09:53.937
- I think I know the cause.

10:23.800 --> 10:27.136
- Robin, are tornadoes
common to New England?

10:27.204 --> 10:28.137
Robin?

10:29.739 --> 10:31.941
- He was just here.

10:36.613 --> 10:38.380
- Unh!

10:41.151 --> 10:42.451
- Who's your new friend?

10:42.519 --> 10:45.788
- Didn't catch his name,
but he plays kinda rough.

10:46.890 --> 10:49.258
- My apologies.

10:49.326 --> 10:52.261
You may address me
as Mr. Twister.

10:57.100 --> 10:58.801
- Uhh! Whoa!

11:16.119 --> 11:17.253
- Whaah!

11:17.320 --> 11:19.288
Uhh! Unh!

11:25.629 --> 11:28.697
- I was prepared to be
challenged by a superhero.

11:28.765 --> 11:31.367
I was not, however,
expecting children.

11:31.434 --> 11:34.436
- We're not children!

11:37.374 --> 11:39.842
- Objectively, you are.

11:39.910 --> 11:41.977
Have you no adult supervision?

11:42.045 --> 11:46.282
I find your presence here
quite disturbing.

11:46.349 --> 11:48.184
- Well, we hate
to see you disturbed.

11:48.251 --> 11:52.087
Let's see if you're more turbed
once we kick your can.

11:55.692 --> 11:56.926
- Yaah!

12:10.574 --> 12:11.974
- Indeed.

12:12.042 --> 12:14.143
That was quite turbing.

12:14.211 --> 12:15.678
Thank you.

12:24.955 --> 12:26.322
- What have you done to my team?

12:26.389 --> 12:29.358
- Embarrassed them, largely.

12:29.426 --> 12:30.593
- Ahh!

12:33.730 --> 12:35.464
- I got you, Wally.

12:35.532 --> 12:38.000
- Ohh. Thanks.

12:38.068 --> 12:41.737
- I would have thought you had all
learned your limitations by now.

12:41.805 --> 12:43.672
- What do you want?!

12:43.740 --> 12:45.341
- Isn't it obvious?

12:45.408 --> 12:48.177
I'm waiting for a real hero.

12:48.245 --> 12:49.912
- Read his mind.
Find a weakness.

12:49.980 --> 12:52.381
- I thought I wasn't
supposed to do that.

12:52.449 --> 12:54.450
- It's ok with the bad guys.

12:57.520 --> 12:59.722
- Nothing. I'm getting nothing.

12:59.789 --> 13:01.390
Hello, Megan.

13:01.458 --> 13:04.493
Mr. Twister is Red Tornado
in disguise.

13:04.561 --> 13:07.162
He's inorganic, an android.

13:07.230 --> 13:10.833
And how many androids do you
know that can generate tornados?

13:10.900 --> 13:13.102
- Red Tornado sent us here.

13:13.169 --> 13:15.337
- After saying we'd be tested
soon enough.

13:15.405 --> 13:18.207
This is his test,
something to keep us busy.

13:18.275 --> 13:20.242
- Speedy called it.
We're a joke.

13:20.310 --> 13:21.910
- Unh!

13:22.779 --> 13:26.248
- This game, so over.

13:28.618 --> 13:31.453
- We know who you are
and what you want.

13:31.521 --> 13:33.122
- So let's end this.

13:33.189 --> 13:35.324
- Consider it ended.

13:40.530 --> 13:42.031
- An impressive show,

13:42.098 --> 13:44.066
But we will not indulge you.

13:44.134 --> 13:46.001
We will not engage.

13:47.971 --> 13:51.006
- Uh, can Red Tornado do that?

13:51.074 --> 13:54.243
- You think I'm Tornado? Ironic.

14:04.487 --> 14:07.189
- Aah!

14:32.200 --> 14:33.467
- Fine, then.

14:33.534 --> 14:35.869
I won't deny
you children have power,

14:35.937 --> 14:38.138
But playing hide-and-seek
with you

14:38.206 --> 14:39.806
Would not help me
achieve my objectives,

14:39.874 --> 14:41.808
So stay concealed.

14:41.876 --> 14:46.680
If you confront me again,
I will show no mercy.

14:52.887 --> 14:53.954
- What happened?

14:54.021 --> 14:56.022
- I placed the bioship
between us.

14:56.090 --> 14:57.090
- Unh! Unh!

14:57.158 --> 14:59.059
And that's supposed
to make it right?

14:59.127 --> 15:01.962
You tricked us into thinking
Twister was Red Tornado.

15:02.029 --> 15:04.030
- She didn't do it on purpose.

15:04.098 --> 15:05.632
- I-it was a rookie mistake.

15:05.700 --> 15:07.067
We shouldn't have listened.

15:07.135 --> 15:08.535
- You are pretty inexperienced.

15:08.603 --> 15:10.303
Hit the showers.

15:10.371 --> 15:12.072
We'll take it from here.

15:12.140 --> 15:14.174
- Stay out of our way.

15:21.048 --> 15:24.718
- I was just trying
to be part of the team.

15:24.786 --> 15:29.356
- To be honest, I'm not sure
we really have a team.

15:48.543 --> 15:51.278
- Certainly this will get
the required attention.

15:51.345 --> 15:52.279
- You got ours,

15:52.346 --> 15:54.281
Full and undivided!

15:56.150 --> 15:58.018
- Immaterial and insufficient!

15:58.085 --> 16:02.088
You are a distraction
I can no longer tolerate.

16:02.156 --> 16:04.558
- Hraah!

16:10.698 --> 16:12.632
- The team really
needs your help.

16:12.700 --> 16:15.969
- If I intervened,
it would not be to help.

16:16.037 --> 16:18.772
Still, it is an odd coincidence

16:18.840 --> 16:21.975
That this Twister
shares my elemental abilities

16:22.043 --> 16:25.345
And my immunity to telepathy.

16:25.413 --> 16:27.781
- Hello, Megan.

16:34.088 --> 16:35.255
- Ahh!

16:46.200 --> 16:48.034
- Aah!

16:49.504 --> 16:51.271
- Whoa. Whoa.

16:51.339 --> 16:53.173
Ahh!

16:58.546 --> 17:00.380
Whaah!

17:11.659 --> 17:13.260
- You brought your utility belt?

17:13.327 --> 17:16.128
- Never leave home without it--
first thing Batman taught me.

17:16.196 --> 17:18.932
- Yeah, right after never
go to the bathroom without it.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.267
Listen to me...

17:20.334 --> 17:22.202
- Unh!
- All of you.

17:22.270 --> 17:23.603
- What did we tell you?

17:23.671 --> 17:25.771
- I know,
and I know I messed up,

17:25.839 --> 17:28.842
But now I'm very clear
on what we need to do.

17:28.910 --> 17:30.076
Please trust me.

17:31.312 --> 17:33.880
- Get back!
Everyone clear the area!

17:41.389 --> 17:43.423
- Hit the showers, boys.

17:43.491 --> 17:45.892
I was hoping
you could handle this.

17:45.960 --> 17:47.561
Clearly you cannot.

17:47.628 --> 17:49.563
- But we've got a plan now.

17:49.630 --> 17:52.365
- The subject
is not up for debate.

17:53.568 --> 17:57.103
- I was beginning to believe
you'd never show up.

17:57.171 --> 17:59.105
- I'm here now.

18:09.650 --> 18:12.419
We are evenly matched, Twister.

18:13.654 --> 18:17.123
- No, Tornado, we are not.

18:28.836 --> 18:32.305
Remain still, android.

18:37.211 --> 18:41.047
The reprogramming
won't take long.

18:42.550 --> 18:44.584
- Longer than you might think.

18:44.652 --> 18:46.252
- No.

19:25.593 --> 19:28.461
Foul. I--I call foul.

19:31.632 --> 19:33.299
- M'gann, no!

19:38.572 --> 19:41.141
- Don't know how things
are done on Mars,

19:41.208 --> 19:44.077
But on Earth, we don't
execute our captives!

19:44.145 --> 19:46.179
- You said you trust me.

19:50.551 --> 19:53.687
That's why
I couldn't read his mind.

19:55.322 --> 19:57.824
- Cool. Souvenir.

19:58.859 --> 20:00.794
- We should have had
more faith in you.

20:00.861 --> 20:04.030
- Yeah. You rocked this mission.

20:04.098 --> 20:05.031
Get it?

20:05.099 --> 20:06.433
Rocked. Heh.

20:06.500 --> 20:07.467
- Ignore him.

20:07.535 --> 20:10.503
We're all just turbed
you're on the team.

20:11.372 --> 20:14.407
- Heh. Thanks. Me, too.

20:16.077 --> 20:18.945
- Heh. Now, brom,
aren't you relieved

20:19.013 --> 20:21.314
I didn't let you
wear the armor?

20:21.382 --> 20:23.483
- Extremely, professor,
but you're not upset?

20:23.551 --> 20:26.553
- I'm convinced our tracking
program was operational

20:26.620 --> 20:29.889
And that the real Tornado
was somewhere in the vicinity.

20:29.957 --> 20:34.260
Besides, you know science
advances in fits and starts.

20:34.328 --> 20:36.663
Even failure can be instructive,

20:36.731 --> 20:40.500
And I'd say we learned
quite a lot today.

20:45.406 --> 20:48.942
- It was clearly created
to sabotage or destroy you.

20:49.009 --> 20:49.876
- Agreed.

20:49.944 --> 20:51.678
- Is that why
you wouldn't help us?

20:51.746 --> 20:53.179
- No. This was your battle.

20:53.247 --> 20:57.317
I do not believe it is my role
to solve your problems for you.

20:57.384 --> 20:59.285
Nor should you solve mine
for me.

20:59.353 --> 21:02.355
- But if you're in danger...

21:02.423 --> 21:04.924
- Consider this matter closed.

21:06.761 --> 21:07.961
- Batman, Aquaman, and Flash,

21:08.028 --> 21:10.363
They'd have jumped right in
to fix things.

21:10.431 --> 21:12.866
- Guess if we're gonna have
a baby sitter,

21:12.933 --> 21:15.301
A heartless machine
is exactly what we need.

21:15.369 --> 21:16.302
- Dude! Harsh.

21:16.370 --> 21:17.303
- And inaccurate.

21:17.371 --> 21:18.671
I have a heart,

21:18.739 --> 21:20.373
Carbon-steel alloy.

21:20.441 --> 21:22.709
I also have excellent hearing.

21:22.777 --> 21:24.377
- Heh. Right.

21:24.445 --> 21:28.114
Sorry. I'll strive
to be more accurate.

21:28.182 --> 21:30.016
- And more respectful.

21:34.722 --> 21:38.024
- Speedy was so wrong.
This team thing...

21:38.092 --> 21:40.193
- Might just work out.

21:44.165 --> 21:45.498
- Sorry.
