WEBVTT

00:01.842 --> 00:03.844
We're basically done,
I mean we're just doing tweaks,

00:03.878 --> 00:05.646
but I'm actually really happy
with how it's going.

00:05.680 --> 00:07.515
Hey, is that Dr. Greenblatt?

00:07.548 --> 00:11.177
Oh, yeah, yeah, that is.

00:11.686 --> 00:13.854
Wow... wow, wow!

00:13.888 --> 00:15.356
Oh, my God.

00:15.390 --> 00:17.257
- I thought he was married.
- Yeah, for like, 20 years.

00:17.291 --> 00:19.626
Well, he's either divorced
or having an affair,

00:19.659 --> 00:21.896
which isn't that pretty
much everyone these days?

00:21.929 --> 00:23.463
No, we're not.

00:23.497 --> 00:25.565
- You don't know me.
- I know we're not divorced.

00:25.599 --> 00:28.502
- Well, do you?
- Yeah, just keep looking left.

00:28.535 --> 00:31.205
All right, all about the left,
all about the left.

00:31.238 --> 00:34.141
Oh, I'm in a situation on the left,
I'm going to have to swing right.

00:34.174 --> 00:36.143
Andrea, Mike, hey, hi.

00:36.176 --> 00:38.045
Oh, my God! Dr. Greenblatt!

00:38.078 --> 00:39.947
- Hey, I thought it was you two.
- I didn't recognize you

00:39.980 --> 00:42.416
without you jamming
your fingers in my mouth.

00:42.449 --> 00:44.418
Oh, sorry, I can do that
now if you'd like.

00:44.451 --> 00:45.986
Hi!

00:46.020 --> 00:49.189
We're patients of your...

00:49.223 --> 00:50.757
This is my wife, Vicki.

00:50.790 --> 00:52.726
I'm sure I've gushed about
her to you over the years.

00:52.759 --> 00:54.561
It's nice to finally meet
Vicki the wife.

00:54.594 --> 00:56.030
- Nice to meet you.
- Are you guys celebrating

00:56.063 --> 00:57.364
like an anniversary or something?

00:57.397 --> 01:00.234
No, no, we're just out for a quick bite.

01:00.267 --> 01:01.735
- Tuesday.
- Oh.

01:01.768 --> 01:03.270
- You want to sit?
- Oh, no, no.

01:03.303 --> 01:04.538
- We'll let you get back to your dinner.
- You're finished. Yeah, yeah.

01:04.571 --> 01:05.705
Okay.

01:05.739 --> 01:08.008
So nice to meet you,
and so nice to see you.

01:08.042 --> 01:09.776
I recommend the creme brulee,

01:09.809 --> 01:11.745
mostly because I want to
see you two more often.

01:11.778 --> 01:14.148
Ah... ah-ha, okay.

01:14.185 --> 01:18.318
- Keep flossing.
- Oh, we will keep flossing.

01:19.553 --> 01:22.856
That is his wife.

01:22.889 --> 01:25.759
Oh, fuck you.

01:42.342 --> 01:44.644
I can't make up my mind if it
was weird they were making out,

01:44.678 --> 01:46.413
or weird that it was in public.

01:46.446 --> 01:48.582
Oh, it was weird that it was in public.

01:48.615 --> 01:50.384
We've never been those people.

01:50.417 --> 01:51.952
And we're, like, happily married

01:51.986 --> 01:54.488
and we're still totes horns
for each other, right?

01:54.521 --> 01:55.490
We are totes horns.

01:55.523 --> 01:58.192
Even my therapist says,
by the way, very rare.

01:58.225 --> 02:00.127
We have sex, like, three times
a week, that's a lot.

02:00.160 --> 02:02.696
- We have sex two times a week.
- You don't know what I do.

02:02.729 --> 02:04.531
I know exactly how many
times we've had sex.

02:04.564 --> 02:06.333
It does bring up
an interesting point, though.

02:06.366 --> 02:09.036
When was the last time we just,
like, we made out?

02:09.068 --> 02:10.836
We made out three days ago.

02:10.871 --> 02:13.473
That was for, like, five seconds
and led right into sex,

02:13.507 --> 02:14.808
that's not making out.

02:14.841 --> 02:16.210
What do you mean by "just make out"?

02:16.243 --> 02:17.711
I'm talking about make out.

02:17.744 --> 02:20.080
I'm talking about, like,
there's no goal in mind,

02:20.114 --> 02:25.185
we take our time, and it's just
being in each other's mouths.

02:25.219 --> 02:26.853
Oof, that makes me sick.

02:26.887 --> 02:30.057
It's like our tongues are
resting on each other's tongues

02:30.090 --> 02:33.060
and we settle into
just tongue on tongue.

02:33.093 --> 02:34.428
Just, like, a real good make out.

02:34.461 --> 02:36.730
This is ruining kissing for me forever.

02:36.763 --> 02:39.099
I feel like you just need
to experience it anew.

02:39.133 --> 02:40.767
Do you want to be make out people?

02:40.800 --> 02:42.769
No, I'm not saying I want
to be make out people.

02:42.802 --> 02:45.339
I just want to know if other
people are, like, going around,

02:45.372 --> 02:48.909
behind closed doors,
doing stuff like this.

02:48.943 --> 02:51.245
Stuff like being
affectionate and intimate?

02:51.278 --> 02:53.213
Yeah, exactly, because
I'll get pitchforks

02:53.247 --> 02:55.082
and I will run them out of their homes.

02:55.115 --> 02:56.583
They can't act like that.

02:56.616 --> 02:58.919
I will say, though, I feel
like old Dr. Greenblatt

02:58.953 --> 03:02.189
was really just kind of, like,
showing off in front of us.

03:02.222 --> 03:05.425
I don't know if I'd go back to him
after his behavior tonight.

03:05.459 --> 03:07.427
It does kind of make him
seem kind of like a pervert.

03:07.461 --> 03:08.919
Do you think so?

03:08.929 --> 03:11.365
Huh, now I kinda want to go back to him.

03:11.398 --> 03:14.301
Like "Sophie's Choice,"
I choose pervert.

03:14.334 --> 03:15.337
That's clear.

03:16.937 --> 03:18.872
Okay, so it's a first date,
they're having a good time,

03:18.905 --> 03:21.708
I mean, Lori's suspicious,
but she's into him.

03:21.741 --> 03:23.944
Christopher walks her to her
car, you think it's going to be

03:23.978 --> 03:26.446
the big first kiss moment,
he leans in and he says,

03:26.480 --> 03:27.982
"Can I get a blowjob?"

03:28.015 --> 03:29.416
Yeah, I like it, I like it.

03:29.449 --> 03:31.585
But we should have him ask
for a handjob.

03:31.618 --> 03:33.120
Why would he ask for a handjob?

03:33.153 --> 03:35.589
Because asking for
a handjob is just creepier.

03:35.622 --> 03:37.324
Yeah, but it's so much easier to do.

03:37.357 --> 03:39.126
A blowjob would be a bigger ask.

03:39.159 --> 03:40.627
But that's the common ask.

03:40.660 --> 03:42.963
A handjob, you can
give yourself a handjob,

03:42.997 --> 03:44.798
so to be asking someone
to give it to you...

03:44.831 --> 03:47.267
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, no, you can't.

03:47.301 --> 03:49.003
You can't give yourself a handjob?

03:49.036 --> 03:50.470
No, you can jerk yourself off,

03:50.504 --> 03:52.339
you can't give yourself a handjob.

03:52.372 --> 03:54.341
A handjob is a job for another person.

03:54.374 --> 03:55.642
- Why?
- It's the same reason

03:55.675 --> 03:57.344
you can't tickle yourself.

03:57.377 --> 03:58.678
Some people sit on their hand,

03:58.712 --> 04:00.514
wait for it to go numb
and then jerk off.

04:00.547 --> 04:02.582
You didn't say,
"some people sit on their hand,

04:02.616 --> 04:05.585
take their hand out and
give themselves a handjob."

04:05.619 --> 04:07.787
Okay, regardless, though,
if I was on a first date,

04:07.821 --> 04:11.125
and a guy asks for a blowjob,
I'd be like, ugh, annoyed.

04:11.158 --> 04:12.759
But if he asked for a handjob?

04:12.792 --> 04:15.662
But if it's a first date,
a blowjob is so intimate.

04:15.695 --> 04:19.333
Intimacy isn't what's funny,
it's that it's the stranger request.

04:19.366 --> 04:21.135
Let's table this for now.

04:21.168 --> 04:22.602
Oh, shit, I gotta go.

04:22.636 --> 04:25.005
I got that kindergarten
admissions interview.

04:25.039 --> 04:27.207
I can't believe you're going
from blowjobs to kindergarten.

04:27.241 --> 04:30.044
Oh, no, I'm not, I'm going
from handjobs to kindergarten.

04:30.077 --> 04:32.612
- It's weird you're a mother.
- I know, right?

04:32.646 --> 04:34.548
Actually, she's very cute,
so I keep her.

04:34.581 --> 04:37.351
She was doing this pirate girl
thing the other day.

04:37.384 --> 04:39.353
- You want to see pics?
- Sure, I love pirates.

04:39.386 --> 04:40.854
Okay, scroll through quickly.

04:40.887 --> 04:42.189
Oh, that's great!

04:42.222 --> 04:44.658
Right?

04:44.691 --> 04:48.295
Very good... amazing.

04:50.897 --> 04:51.965
God damn it!

04:51.998 --> 04:54.201
I can't believe I fell for this again.

04:54.234 --> 04:56.570
It's my favorite bit.

04:56.603 --> 04:59.373
It's so crazy, it's like
she's biting down on, like,

04:59.406 --> 05:02.042
a fleshy animal's tail.

05:02.076 --> 05:04.211
But it's like she's getting
a real kick out of it.

05:04.244 --> 05:07.881
Her eyes say...
she's kind of delighted by it.

05:07.914 --> 05:09.749
What? Have you looked at her eyes?

05:09.783 --> 05:12.752
Her eyes say, "I'm capable
of biting this dick off."

05:12.786 --> 05:15.389
All right, I gotta go.
I will email you the changes,

05:15.422 --> 05:16.990
obviously I'll change that handjob.

05:17.023 --> 05:19.226
Blow... job.

05:19.259 --> 05:21.928
You know what, you're right,
it is weird that I'm going

05:21.961 --> 05:23.730
from blowjobs to a meeting
where I have to say,

05:23.763 --> 05:25.765
"I appreciate how
your school fosters..."

05:25.799 --> 05:27.901
... a sense of independence
and self-worth,

05:27.934 --> 05:32.572
which is what we want her school to do.

05:32.606 --> 05:34.741
Good, well, we are very
proud of our program here

05:34.774 --> 05:35.842
and we really believe in what we do.

05:35.875 --> 05:37.577
- You should.
- Thank you.

05:37.611 --> 05:39.513
So, tell me a little bit
about yourselves

05:39.546 --> 05:41.248
and what is it that you two do?

05:41.281 --> 05:42.749
- Well...
- I'm a lawyer,

05:42.782 --> 05:44.418
mostly entertainment law.

05:44.451 --> 05:46.386
And I am a writer.

05:46.420 --> 05:47.887
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

05:47.921 --> 05:49.389
What kind of stuff do you write?

05:49.423 --> 05:55.229
Uh... it's a lot
of different... mediums,

05:55.262 --> 05:56.730
- sort of that I could go...
- Such as?

05:56.763 --> 05:58.932
... slightly in the comedy space.

05:58.965 --> 06:03.237
There's some web, you know,
just different sort of like,

06:03.270 --> 06:04.604
podcast-y things.

06:04.638 --> 06:07.641
- Oh, like NPR?
- Yeah, like NPR.

06:07.674 --> 06:11.145
The thing that I always
look back at is that

06:11.178 --> 06:12.946
it's the teachers that I had

06:12.979 --> 06:14.281
that instilled the confidence
in me in the first place

06:14.314 --> 06:15.615
to become a writer.

06:15.649 --> 06:17.617
I feel the same way about
my teachers, I mean,

06:17.651 --> 06:20.620
that's probably how I ended up here.

06:20.654 --> 06:21.988
I think that went well.

06:22.021 --> 06:23.390
That went very well.

06:23.423 --> 06:25.125
I really liked old Joan Joan.

06:25.159 --> 06:27.294
Nice job dodging the
"what do you write?" question.

06:27.327 --> 06:30.164
Oh, my God, what if she
asks me for that podcast?

06:30.197 --> 06:32.132
She's going to be looking
for your podcast.

06:32.166 --> 06:35.068
Oh, "Joansies loves Chachies"
is not gonna like that podcast.

06:35.101 --> 06:37.837
- Nope, you nailed that one.
- Thank you.

06:37.871 --> 06:39.839
But we're still not telling
her your last name, right?

06:39.873 --> 06:42.942
Oh, God, no, we can't have
Joansies Googling me.

06:42.976 --> 06:44.644
- No, no good will come of that.
- No.

06:44.678 --> 06:46.846
Unless she thinks
I'm the other Andrea Warren

06:46.880 --> 06:49.749
whose that head nun at the
Stanbrook Abby in Devonshire,

06:49.783 --> 06:53.153
England, because she does
very, very important things.

06:53.187 --> 06:55.155
So you're the one googling
yourself, let's be honest.

06:55.189 --> 06:57.291
Hey, just be lucky you're not married

06:57.324 --> 06:59.593
to the other Andrea Warren
who burned her house down

06:59.626 --> 07:01.895
- with her entire family inside.
- She sounds nice.

07:01.928 --> 07:03.430
- Okay.
- All right.

07:03.463 --> 07:05.132
I gotta go pick up Amelia,
I'll see you later.

07:05.165 --> 07:07.301
Wait.

07:07.334 --> 07:08.635
You think this is one of those moments

07:08.668 --> 07:10.304
where we're supposed to like make out?

07:10.337 --> 07:11.471
- Make out?
- Yeah.

07:11.505 --> 07:12.906
Why would we make out now?

07:12.939 --> 07:14.341
I don't know, bro!

07:14.374 --> 07:16.143
I'm just trying to be
open to new things.

07:16.176 --> 07:17.611
Uh-huh, this is what you're open to?

07:17.644 --> 07:19.346
Making out in the potential
school parking lot.

07:19.379 --> 07:23.417
Listen, we're just all spinning
on the same big, blue marble.

07:23.450 --> 07:25.952
- Cool, bro.
- So, bye, bro.

07:25.986 --> 07:27.521
Get on the marble.

07:28.088 --> 07:30.558
I haven't gone to the bathroom
alone in five years.

07:30.591 --> 07:32.727
Aww, but then Max,
you're going to miss him

07:32.760 --> 07:34.395
when he doesn't want to do that anymore.

07:34.429 --> 07:36.797
Okay, I have a question for your
guys... it's less about pooping.

07:36.831 --> 07:38.265
Sorry, Brian.

07:38.299 --> 07:40.167
All right, I know we don't
know each other that well,

07:40.200 --> 07:42.069
but I need a group of married
people for this poll.

07:42.102 --> 07:46.474
Do you guys ever just, like, make out?

07:46.507 --> 07:48.242
- Like with my husband?
- Yeah.

07:48.275 --> 07:49.910
Mike and I were out the other
night, we saw this, like,

07:49.944 --> 07:52.647
longtime couple just going
at it, and I was like,

07:52.680 --> 07:55.916
is everyone else just
going around, making out?

07:55.950 --> 07:58.285
Making out is what you do
when you can't have sex.

07:58.319 --> 07:59.954
- Right?
- Right, yeah.

07:59.987 --> 08:03.358
Well, I feel like Brendon
and I something just make out.

08:03.391 --> 08:04.925
- Really?
- I mean, not out in public.

08:04.959 --> 08:06.927
Sometimes it's nice to have affection

08:06.961 --> 08:08.763
that doesn't have to end in sex.

08:08.796 --> 08:10.631
You know what, that's
actually a good way to put it.

08:10.665 --> 08:13.000
I agree with that,
and I feel like Mike and I do,

08:13.033 --> 08:14.201
but I don't know.

08:14.234 --> 08:17.271
Laura, Affection may be
your Love Language.

08:17.304 --> 08:20.341
What are the words coming
out of your mouth right now?

08:20.375 --> 08:21.609
Your Love Language... Oh, see,

08:21.642 --> 08:22.843
Gail and I have been
reading this book...

08:22.877 --> 08:24.278
Really?

08:24.311 --> 08:26.146
... called "The Five Love
Languages," and it's all about

08:26.180 --> 08:30.284
how people are springing
different expressions of love

08:30.317 --> 08:31.652
in very different ways.

08:31.686 --> 08:33.120
Do you have to do this with it?

08:33.153 --> 08:35.322
It makes you want to do this
if you read that book.

08:35.356 --> 08:36.857
It does, yeah, my husband and I read it.

08:36.890 --> 08:39.460
It just kind of tweaks the way
you think about your relationship.

08:39.494 --> 08:40.995
Can I borrow your copy?

08:41.028 --> 08:42.363
No, no.

08:42.397 --> 08:45.500
What do you mean, "No, no"?
Why can't I borrow your copy?

08:45.533 --> 08:46.667
Just download it.

08:46.701 --> 08:48.202
No, I'm not going to download it!

08:48.235 --> 08:50.905
I like a book in my hand,
I'm not a monster, Brian.

08:50.938 --> 08:53.741
If anyone knows monsters,
it's this monster.

08:53.774 --> 08:56.243
- How dare you?
- Oh, he likes you, he is such a flirt.

08:56.276 --> 08:58.145
Oh, he is going to be
such a heartbreaker,

08:58.178 --> 08:59.480
you better watch out.

08:59.514 --> 09:01.482
Oh, what about this smiling little girl?

09:01.516 --> 09:03.918
She's going to be a little cock tease.

09:03.951 --> 09:06.320
You watch out.

09:06.353 --> 09:08.155
Wow.

09:08.188 --> 09:10.491
Oh... no, I'm not...

09:10.525 --> 09:15.763
obviously calling her an actual
blank-tease, I was...

09:15.796 --> 09:18.399
You said he was a flirt, he's a baby.

09:18.433 --> 09:20.901
I was doing the same thing.

09:20.935 --> 09:24.872
I... I was just flipping it
for the girls' side, you know.

09:24.905 --> 09:28.843
By the way, it's kind of
a poignant joke,

09:28.876 --> 09:30.511
if you think about it,
talking about that

09:30.545 --> 09:32.513
the way we talk
about different genders...

09:32.547 --> 09:35.716
Oh, my God, here are the kids! Yay!

09:37.952 --> 09:40.621
It just seems like everyone
at school is, you know,

09:40.655 --> 09:42.890
joking around,
they're seemingly very cool,

09:42.923 --> 09:46.026
and then suddenly I say something
that clearly crosses a line.

09:46.060 --> 09:48.195
I forget that other people
have a much closer line

09:48.228 --> 09:50.297
than the hilarious,
disgusting, broken people

09:50.330 --> 09:52.867
that I consider to be some of
my closest friends.

09:52.900 --> 09:55.069
Yeah, as a lawyer I got to
go to work and be serious

09:55.102 --> 09:57.371
in front of my clients,
but then I get to come home

09:57.404 --> 09:59.774
and relax and be funny.

10:01.141 --> 10:02.577
You are the worst.

10:02.610 --> 10:04.445
The point is, everyone
has to wear a two hats.

10:04.479 --> 10:07.748
I know, but for me, it's like
two very different hats.

10:07.782 --> 10:10.885
It's like, one is a hat
and one is a blouse.

10:10.918 --> 10:11.965
Well, you gotta make a blouse

10:11.967 --> 10:13.420
- look good on top of your head.
- Done.

10:13.476 --> 10:15.122
'Cause you're going to have to
pull back a little at school

10:15.155 --> 10:17.057
unless you want "cock tease"
to define your daughter.

10:17.091 --> 10:19.426
Mike, that baby was the cock tease.

10:19.460 --> 10:20.728
Amelia is more a prude.

10:20.761 --> 10:22.396
Feel free to pull back at home too.

10:22.429 --> 10:24.765
Obviously I don't want to
negatively affect her life,

10:24.799 --> 10:27.668
and these people are her world,
farts, farts, farts.

10:27.702 --> 10:29.269
I guess this is
one of those shitty times

10:29.303 --> 10:31.906
where I have to suck it up
and pretend to be grown up.

10:31.939 --> 10:34.642
I've kind of been
waiting for this moment.

10:34.675 --> 10:38.946
- Oh, fuck your face, Mike.
- Really?

10:38.979 --> 10:40.915
Yeah.

10:40.948 --> 10:42.583
<i>I don't think that's the one.</i>

10:42.617 --> 10:44.585
I think they recommended
"The Four Agreements"

10:44.619 --> 10:45.786
and "Way of the Peaceful Warrior".

10:45.820 --> 10:47.922
I already read "Peaceful Warrior".

10:47.955 --> 10:49.423
Oh, what about "The Power of Now"?

10:49.456 --> 10:51.158
If you guys are looking for
"The Four Agreements"...

10:51.191 --> 10:52.927
Sorry, didn't mean to eavesdrop, but...

10:52.960 --> 10:54.194
- No.
- ... I think that's your guy.

10:54.228 --> 10:55.530
Thank you.

10:55.563 --> 10:57.798
You guys really are working
through this section.

10:57.832 --> 10:59.366
I'm impressed.

10:59.399 --> 11:00.935
I'm just going through some stuff.

11:00.968 --> 11:02.937
- He's working on himself.
- I like your honesty.

11:02.970 --> 11:05.806
Is that like a pre-requisite
to even step into this area?

11:05.840 --> 11:07.508
- How about you?
- Why are you in this section?

11:07.542 --> 11:09.109
I guess we are being honest.

11:09.143 --> 11:10.678
Nothing, really, I'm just
picking up this book,

11:10.711 --> 11:11.812
a friend of mine recommended it.

11:11.846 --> 11:12.880
- I read that book.
- Really?

11:12.913 --> 11:14.181
Gary Chapman is the shit.

11:14.214 --> 11:16.216
I feel like that should be on the cover.

11:16.250 --> 11:18.886
- Acts of Service.
- I don't know what that means.

11:18.919 --> 11:21.121
That's my Love Language,
how to accept love.

11:21.155 --> 11:23.357
Okay, okay, he said
a little bit about, okay.

11:23.390 --> 11:25.993
Dude, remember we thought yours
was "Word of Affirmation"?

11:26.026 --> 11:30.030
Oh, yeah, "Acts of Service"
is my main, because of my mom,

11:30.064 --> 11:31.331
she was never really super huggy-kissy.

11:31.365 --> 11:32.633
Mine, the same thing.

11:32.667 --> 11:34.134
My mom is not like an,
"I love you" person.

11:34.168 --> 11:36.070
But mine, she was always there,
helping me out.

11:36.103 --> 11:37.905
I'm might be the same thing,
Acts of Service,

11:37.938 --> 11:40.007
that's what she does for me.

11:40.040 --> 11:41.508
I'm very excited to read this now.

11:41.542 --> 11:43.878
Thank you guys for the rec.

11:43.911 --> 11:45.646
Physical touch is my love language.

11:45.680 --> 11:47.347
Oh, okay, cool, cool.

11:49.717 --> 11:50.918
I'm sorry.

11:50.951 --> 11:52.720
Are you waiting for me to touch you?

11:52.753 --> 11:54.488
Whatever you want.

11:54.521 --> 11:56.691
Okay, sure.

11:58.593 --> 12:01.061
There you go, how did that feel?

12:01.095 --> 12:02.830
Thanks, man.

12:02.863 --> 12:04.599
You know what?
I don't think I'm Physical Touch.

12:04.632 --> 12:06.834
I'm going with vest, Acts of Service.

12:06.867 --> 12:08.836
- All day, every day.
- All day, every day.

12:12.039 --> 12:13.841
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi, Grampy!

12:13.874 --> 12:17.177
<i>Hey, sunshine! I'm sending you kisses...</i>

12:17.211 --> 12:19.747
- Okay, it's just me now.
- Oh, okay.

12:19.780 --> 12:22.416
So you know how I'm dating my allergist?

12:22.449 --> 12:24.351
No, I didn't even know
you had allergies.

12:24.384 --> 12:26.120
Yeah, she's that good.

12:26.153 --> 12:27.788
<i>Yeah, Bonnie's wonderful,
I've never been so happy.</i>

12:27.822 --> 12:29.189
Oh, that's fabulous.

12:29.223 --> 12:31.191
How long have you been
seeing this Bon-bon?

12:31.225 --> 12:34.028
About a month now,
and I'm excited about it.

12:34.061 --> 12:36.196
- In fact, she's here now.
- <i>Oh, good, good, good.</i>

12:36.230 --> 12:38.599
Honey, could I get another Merlot?

12:38.633 --> 12:40.735
Merlot? Dad, it's nine a.m.

12:40.768 --> 12:42.202
Where do we have to be, sweetheart?

12:42.236 --> 12:44.204
- Apparently nowhere sober.
- <i>So listen,</i>

12:44.238 --> 12:46.273
we spend a lot of time with her kids.

12:46.306 --> 12:49.076
- You do?
- <i>Yeah, and I was thinking that</i>

12:49.109 --> 12:50.645
I would like her
to get to meet you guys.

12:50.678 --> 12:52.279
I would love to meet Bonnie.

12:52.312 --> 12:55.716
How about you come over
for drinks next Saturday?

12:55.750 --> 12:57.084
Okay, so like at nine a.m.?

12:57.117 --> 12:58.919
Whenever you want to start.

12:58.953 --> 13:01.288
All right, let me talk to Mike,
and we'll figure out

13:01.321 --> 13:03.090
when a good time is for us to come.

13:03.123 --> 13:05.092
Enjoy your morning Merlot, dad.

13:05.125 --> 13:07.061
And it's casual, wear anything you want.

13:07.094 --> 13:09.664
- <i>I wasn't going to dress up.</i>
- Okay.

13:09.697 --> 13:10.998
- <i>Bye.</i>
- Bye.

13:11.031 --> 13:14.068
Big news... Thank you, by the way...

13:14.101 --> 13:17.905
My dad has allergies,
and also a new girlfriend.

13:17.938 --> 13:19.439
Well, at least he moved off your mom.

13:19.473 --> 13:22.109
Please, he's biding his time
until Leon dies.

13:22.142 --> 13:23.644
But we're going to head over to my dad's

13:23.678 --> 13:26.246
and meet Bonnie next
weekend for a drink.

13:26.280 --> 13:27.581
Very cool.

13:27.614 --> 13:28.816
Oh, what's happening?

13:28.849 --> 13:29.917
You like that?

13:29.950 --> 13:32.419
Yeah sure, I think.

13:32.452 --> 13:34.088
Okay... wow.

13:34.121 --> 13:35.489
According to this book
that I've been reading,

13:35.522 --> 13:37.825
everybody takes in love in,
like, a different way,

13:37.858 --> 13:41.161
and those are called their Love
Languages, and I think for you,

13:41.195 --> 13:44.164
your Love Language is Physical Touch.

13:44.198 --> 13:45.532
- Okay.
- With a little bit of

13:45.565 --> 13:47.434
Words of Affirmation.

13:47.467 --> 13:50.604
You are great.

13:50.637 --> 13:52.039
That probably should creep me out,

13:52.072 --> 13:53.307
but that was actually very nice.

13:53.340 --> 13:54.641
- Right?
- Thank you.

13:54.675 --> 13:55.943
And it actually makes a lot of sense.

13:55.976 --> 13:57.611
What other languages are there?

13:57.644 --> 13:59.947
Well, we got your Physical
Touch, Words of Affirmation,

13:59.980 --> 14:02.516
you got Gift Giving, Acts of
Service, and Quality Time.

14:02.549 --> 14:04.318
Doesn't everyone love
all those things, or... ?

14:04.351 --> 14:05.385
If you think about it,

14:05.419 --> 14:07.955
one of them will
particularly speak to you.

14:07.988 --> 14:09.656
Like in my case,
it's all Acts of Service.

14:09.690 --> 14:12.459
You could say nice things to me
all day, it wouldn't mean shit.

14:12.492 --> 14:13.627
- Oh.
- But if you, like,

14:13.660 --> 14:15.229
make a dinner reservation,

14:15.262 --> 14:17.865
then I get a giant lady boner, bing.

14:17.898 --> 14:19.533
Is it hard to make a dinner reservation?

14:19.566 --> 14:21.301
No, but that's not the point.

14:21.335 --> 14:24.138
It's like you did something for
me and so then I don't have to.

14:24.171 --> 14:26.673
I think it's sweet that you're
thinking about our relationship.

14:26.707 --> 14:28.308
I always think about our relationship.

14:28.342 --> 14:30.010
I know you do,
but I know that this is...

14:30.044 --> 14:31.211
I don't always think about
our relationship.

14:31.245 --> 14:32.913
... I appreciate never, and...

14:32.947 --> 14:35.149
Just to be clear, but I am
thinking about it now.

14:35.182 --> 14:36.984
- Would you like me to read the book?
- Go for it.

14:37.017 --> 14:38.152
- Nice.
- Yeah.

14:38.185 --> 14:39.653
How about I make dinner tonight?

14:39.686 --> 14:42.322
Mmm... bing.

14:42.356 --> 14:45.059
- You got that was my clitoris, right?
- Yep, I read.

14:45.460 --> 14:47.662
And putting together that desk
from Ikea was impossible.

14:47.695 --> 14:49.097
Oh, yeah, it's the worst.

14:49.130 --> 14:50.832
By the end, Jeff is on top,
I'm on the bottom,

14:50.866 --> 14:53.835
and we still can't
shove the thing in the hole.

14:53.869 --> 14:55.370
That's what she said.

14:55.403 --> 14:57.305
Okay, I wasn't going
to say it, for the record.

14:57.338 --> 15:00.708
By the way, Acts of Service with
a little touch of Gift Giving.

15:00.807 --> 15:01.809
I read the book.

15:01.843 --> 15:04.279
Oh, same but different...
A little touch of Gift Giving,

15:04.312 --> 15:06.181
with a skosh of Acts of Service.

15:06.214 --> 15:07.615
Oh, I see you.

15:07.648 --> 15:09.184
Yeah, I'm looking at you as well.

15:09.217 --> 15:11.887
Acts of Service, that was
my nickname in college.

15:11.920 --> 15:14.155
Oh, no, that's what we call you now.

15:14.189 --> 15:18.693
Oh, coming in strong! I like it!

15:18.726 --> 15:20.862
Hey, what do you have in there?
It looks really heavy.

15:20.896 --> 15:23.865
Oh, that's just heroin,
I sell it to the kids.

15:23.899 --> 15:25.400
It's important to get them hooked young.

15:25.433 --> 15:27.502
I mean, the good news is
their skin melts back so fast

15:27.535 --> 15:30.171
you never see the track marks.

15:30.205 --> 15:31.907
Oh, come on!

15:31.940 --> 15:33.841
Everyone's on board
for the slutty nickname

15:33.875 --> 15:35.376
and jamming things in Callie's hole?

15:35.410 --> 15:38.379
This, this is the thing
that crosses the line?

15:38.413 --> 15:42.717
I think you... I'm not
carrying heroin in my bag!

15:42.750 --> 15:44.085
I got books in here,

15:44.119 --> 15:46.254
used books that I am
donating to the school.

15:46.287 --> 15:48.723
Okay, I get it, it was a funny joke.

15:48.756 --> 15:50.558
Okay, thank you.

15:50.591 --> 15:53.228
Plus, I mean, guys, this is
a pretty nice bag.

15:53.261 --> 15:55.830
I'm not going to put heroin in here.

15:55.863 --> 15:59.167
It's obviously made more for cocaine.

15:59.200 --> 16:02.437
Oh, my God. Okay, you know what?

16:02.470 --> 16:05.240
Let's talk about carpool.

16:05.273 --> 16:07.042
I was actually married
to Martin's lawyer.

16:07.075 --> 16:10.011
- Oh, well, well.
- And we were all friends,

16:10.045 --> 16:12.247
but then I realized
he wasn't the one for me,

16:12.280 --> 16:13.915
and I turned around
and there was Martin.

16:13.949 --> 16:15.283
Oh, my God, Bonnie, I'm sorry,

16:15.316 --> 16:16.751
that must have been very startling.

16:16.784 --> 16:18.586
- Well...
- Like at your window,

16:18.619 --> 16:19.887
plastered up against it.

16:19.921 --> 16:21.556
One month in,

16:21.589 --> 16:23.925
I still can't shake him,
that's what's startling.

16:23.959 --> 16:25.760
Should we be alarmed, Bonnie?

16:25.793 --> 16:27.762
Maybe we should establish a safe word.

16:27.795 --> 16:32.033
I have met my match.

16:32.067 --> 16:33.868
I'm going to get
another drink... anybody else?

16:33.901 --> 16:35.403
I'm good... I'll help you
get more chips, though.

16:35.436 --> 16:36.437
I'll have another Rose, sweetie.

16:36.471 --> 16:38.439
Honey, you want me to get you anything?

16:38.473 --> 16:39.941
Yeah, yeah, I'll have another
glass of wine, that'll be great.

16:39.975 --> 16:41.943
- Okay, great.
- No, no, no, but I'll... I'll get it.

16:41.977 --> 16:44.112
- No, I got it.
- No, uh, seriously.

16:44.145 --> 16:44.746
- Seriously, I don't mind.
- I will get it. I will get it.

16:44.748 --> 16:47.815
I don't want you to do it,
I want to get it.

16:47.848 --> 16:48.916
- No.
- All right.

16:48.950 --> 16:51.319
This guy.

16:52.687 --> 16:54.222
It looks to me like she's gonna get it.

16:54.255 --> 16:55.991
- She's gettin' it.
- Mm-hmm.

16:58.159 --> 17:00.962
Dad, I love Bonnie, she is awesome.

17:00.996 --> 17:02.630
Yep, she's a keeper, huh?

17:02.663 --> 17:05.300
I have to say, it's refreshing
to be around new love.

17:05.333 --> 17:06.968
Why? Are you and Mike having problems?

17:07.002 --> 17:08.236
Dad, it's an expression.

17:08.269 --> 17:09.569
Because I know how hard it is

17:09.604 --> 17:12.307
to keep a lasting relationship alive.

17:12.339 --> 17:14.342
Trust me, I've been through two of them.

17:14.375 --> 17:16.777
You've been through
more than that, I think.

17:16.810 --> 17:19.814
Actually, Mike and I are kind
of zhuzhin our relationship

17:19.847 --> 17:22.150
a little bit these days,
keeping it fresh.

17:22.183 --> 17:24.285
I think there are really
two fundamental truths

17:24.319 --> 17:26.753
you have to keep in mind
for a happy relationship.

17:26.787 --> 17:30.925
Number one, above all, it's
about honesty and communication.

17:30.958 --> 17:33.528
And number two, I don't think one person

17:33.561 --> 17:36.297
is ever going to fulfill
everything you need,

17:36.331 --> 17:38.866
and I think it's wrong
to expect that of someone.

17:38.899 --> 17:41.536
That's actually very smart,
that makes sense.

17:41.569 --> 17:45.540
That's why you need
to have an open relationship.

17:45.573 --> 17:46.707
What?

17:46.741 --> 17:49.177
It's what Bonnie and I have.

17:49.210 --> 17:51.646
Wow!

17:51.679 --> 17:53.014
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:53.048 --> 17:54.482
Cool, cool, cool.

17:54.515 --> 17:57.152
I'm going to head outside
with all this stuff,

17:57.185 --> 18:00.955
but thank you for all that advice, cool.

18:00.988 --> 18:02.357
Again, cool, cool, cool.

18:02.390 --> 18:04.025
Speaking of which, how's your mother?

18:04.059 --> 18:05.160
Still with Leon.

18:05.193 --> 18:07.362
- And he is... ?
- Very healthy.

18:07.795 --> 18:09.196
<i>Wait, wait, wait, an open relationship?</i>

18:09.229 --> 18:10.765
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

18:10.798 --> 18:12.800
It was crazy, okay, he was
acting like he was making

18:12.833 --> 18:15.603
complete sense and he understood
how hard a relationship

18:15.636 --> 18:18.405
is to maintain, and then
suddenly I'm picturing my dad

18:18.439 --> 18:19.907
in an "Eyes Wide Shut" situation.

18:19.940 --> 18:21.241
Oh, I don't want to picture any of that.

18:21.275 --> 18:22.577
Yeah, you know what I know?

18:22.610 --> 18:24.244
We need to keep this marriage amazing,

18:24.278 --> 18:26.146
because otherwise it's just
morning Merlot and orgies

18:26.180 --> 18:27.882
in my future, okay?

18:27.915 --> 18:29.917
Which is normally something
I would pretend sounds amazing

18:29.950 --> 18:31.786
just to bother you, but I can't
even joke right now.

18:31.819 --> 18:33.120
I understand.

18:33.153 --> 18:34.655
I don't want to be
those people that are like,

18:34.689 --> 18:37.792
"Oh, we've been together for so long,
we need to spice things up."

18:37.825 --> 18:39.393
Are we? Are we those people?

18:39.426 --> 18:40.961
- Maybe?
- Because I don't think a little

18:40.995 --> 18:44.465
nice gesture and fickle touch
is gonna cut it, my friend.

18:44.499 --> 18:46.601
I knew that that shoulder rub
wasn't random.

18:46.634 --> 18:48.102
Were you really jumping out of your seat

18:48.135 --> 18:49.436
to get that glass of wine?

18:49.470 --> 18:51.005
No, see, everything I do
feels calculated.

18:51.038 --> 18:52.640
That book got in my head.

18:52.673 --> 18:54.408
Yeah, well, this is why
we don't rely on ourselves

18:54.441 --> 18:56.443
to work on ourselves, okay, number one.

18:56.477 --> 18:57.945
You know who I blame?

18:57.978 --> 19:00.648
Fucking Brian, and fucking Gail.

19:00.681 --> 19:02.850
- Who's Gail?
- Brian's wife, Gail.

19:02.883 --> 19:04.351
- Oh, right.
- We've gone to dinner with them.

19:04.384 --> 19:05.853
Yeah, fuck those guys.

19:05.886 --> 19:07.822
You know what? This should
be our Love Language,

19:07.855 --> 19:09.490
telling people to go fuck themselves.

19:09.524 --> 19:10.991
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, my God!

19:11.025 --> 19:12.827
He's just, like, so casual about it.

19:12.860 --> 19:14.595
Maybe we should go talk to Jim?

19:14.629 --> 19:16.497
Yeah, a therapy session
probably wouldn't hurt.

19:16.531 --> 19:18.332
You want me to make the appointment?

19:18.365 --> 19:22.036
Fuck you and your nice gesture,
I will make the appointment.

19:24.972 --> 19:26.841
So, I mean, it's just
everything's starting to feel

19:26.874 --> 19:29.544
really contrived with the
Love Languages and then my dad

19:29.577 --> 19:31.211
is saying we should have
sex with other people.

19:31.245 --> 19:33.047
There's a lot of...

19:33.080 --> 19:34.982
a lot of stuff being
thrown at us at once.

19:35.015 --> 19:37.852
- We are very confused.
- Yes, very confused.

19:37.885 --> 19:42.690
Andrea, your dad is a whole
separate therapy session.

19:42.723 --> 19:44.625
- We should start saving up for that.
- Yeah.

19:44.659 --> 19:46.226
Guys, you are not falling apart, okay?

19:46.260 --> 19:48.963
You've been together for
ten years and you're in a rut.

19:48.996 --> 19:52.332
This is what's amusing is I feel
like we are genuinely happy.

19:52.366 --> 19:53.868
- Yeah.
- And then suddenly, all of a sudden,

19:53.901 --> 19:56.904
- it's just stuff was feeling weird.
- Right.

19:56.937 --> 19:59.339
You can be happy and still need to work

19:59.373 --> 20:01.308
on your romantic relationship.

20:01.341 --> 20:03.544
But we have sex twice a week.

20:03.578 --> 20:06.547
Some of us have it three times a week.

20:06.581 --> 20:08.148
Listen, it's not about quantity,

20:08.182 --> 20:10.250
okay, it's about quality.

20:10.284 --> 20:13.387
Do you feel like you
still try new things

20:13.420 --> 20:15.422
and still surprise each other?

20:15.455 --> 20:17.658
- Yeah, I don't know.
- Maybe.

20:17.692 --> 20:19.827
- There might be room for improvement.
- Yeah.

20:19.860 --> 20:21.395
- I guess so.
- Yeah.

20:21.428 --> 20:23.063
What you're going through
is totally normal.

20:23.097 --> 20:24.732
- That makes me feel better. Good.
- Yeah.

20:24.765 --> 20:26.400
You guys are great together, right?

20:26.433 --> 20:28.335
It's... It's been some years.

20:28.368 --> 20:31.005
And so you might need to make

20:31.038 --> 20:33.007
a little bit more of a conscious effort.

20:33.040 --> 20:35.342
Why don't we talk about some tools?

20:35.375 --> 20:37.745
I'm so sorry, I just
keep getting texted.

20:37.778 --> 20:40.581
Someone's saying it's urgent, I'm sorry,

20:40.615 --> 20:41.916
honey, I'll be right back.

20:41.949 --> 20:43.450
No problem.

20:44.652 --> 20:46.253
Hi, is everything all right?

20:46.286 --> 20:48.222
What's happening? Are you okay?
What's going on?

20:48.255 --> 20:50.758
You were right. Handjob is funnier.

20:50.791 --> 20:52.559
That's why you were calling me?

20:52.593 --> 20:54.061
Suck my dick, Kyle!

20:54.094 --> 20:55.730
But it is funnier, I told you so.

20:55.763 --> 20:58.098
I have to go, bye.

20:58.132 --> 20:59.700
Sorry, sorry.

20:59.734 --> 21:02.569
My friend Kyle was
in a small car accident.

21:02.603 --> 21:05.773
He's shaken, but totally fine.

21:05.806 --> 21:07.975
Okay, so where are we?

21:08.008 --> 21:12.880
We're going to get some
tools to spicy our life up?

21:12.913 --> 21:14.214
I think we start with this, right?

21:14.248 --> 21:15.683
Too much shoulders, right?

21:16.417 --> 21:18.019
We're actually almost
done with the outline.

21:18.053 --> 21:19.821
I think we're going to be
ready to pitch next week.

21:19.855 --> 21:21.322
Okay, good.

21:21.356 --> 21:22.590
I'm very happy with how it's coming out.

21:22.623 --> 21:25.026
It's like really like...

21:25.060 --> 21:26.427
Oh, my God. Jeez...

21:26.461 --> 21:28.563
What is happening? What?

21:28.596 --> 21:30.999
Mike, that doesn't go like that!

21:31.032 --> 21:33.601
Stop, I have lotion on!

21:33.634 --> 21:36.371
What... Stop, stop, stop!

21:36.404 --> 21:39.074
Sorry... sorry.

21:39.076 --> 21:40.476
What?

21:41.376 --> 21:45.513
I'm going to need you to explain

21:45.546 --> 21:48.383
what just happened here.

21:48.416 --> 21:50.418
Well...

21:50.451 --> 21:53.721
- Jim, our therapist...
- Uh-huh.

21:53.755 --> 21:55.556
He said that maybe because
you're an alpha woman,

21:55.590 --> 21:59.727
maybe you would enjoy being dominated.

21:59.761 --> 22:01.362
What?

22:01.396 --> 22:04.032
He said a lot of women
have rape fantasies.

22:04.065 --> 22:06.434
Our therapist told you to rape me?

22:06.467 --> 22:08.970
Yes, that's exactly
the word he used, yeah.

22:09.004 --> 22:11.807
I stepped out of the room
for two seconds and he was like,

22:11.840 --> 22:14.409
"Hey, Mike, rape Andrea later?"

22:14.442 --> 22:15.977
I wanted to run it by you,

22:16.011 --> 22:20.548
but apparently the element of
surprise is a crucial element.

22:20.581 --> 22:21.817
I don't think you could have rape

22:21.850 --> 22:24.219
without the element of surprise,

22:24.252 --> 22:25.821
- I guess.
- Listen...

22:25.854 --> 22:27.388
- I know you think this is funny.
- I...

22:27.422 --> 22:28.957
Just give me a second, please.

22:28.990 --> 22:31.392
We talked about spicing up
things in the bedroom.

22:31.426 --> 22:35.230
- You said, "Hey, what can we do?"
- I did.

22:35.263 --> 22:39.300
And you did the shimmy thing, so...

22:39.334 --> 22:41.903
Are you saying that I asked for it?

22:41.937 --> 22:44.906
No... no, no, no, no,
I would never say that.

22:44.940 --> 22:46.141
I'm kidding.

22:46.174 --> 22:49.577
I honestly... and this is
something that unfortunately

22:49.610 --> 22:51.746
I feel like people don't
get to say very often...

22:51.779 --> 22:55.083
I think it's very sweet
that you tried to rape me.

22:55.116 --> 22:56.852
Wow, that sounds horrible.

22:56.885 --> 22:58.186
No, I'm serious.

22:58.219 --> 23:00.088
You, you put yourself out
there and did something

23:00.121 --> 23:02.590
that's very contrary to
your nature just because

23:02.623 --> 23:03.925
you thought I would like it,

23:03.959 --> 23:06.761
and that's actually very touching.

23:06.794 --> 23:09.965
Thank you for trying to rape me.

23:09.998 --> 23:11.332
What?

23:11.366 --> 23:13.201
- Stop saying that word.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

23:13.234 --> 23:15.270
Thank you for trying to...

23:15.303 --> 23:19.007
violate me... violently?

23:19.040 --> 23:21.676
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Do you need me to hold you?

23:21.709 --> 23:24.112
- Come here.
- Please, please.

23:24.145 --> 23:27.482
I mean, you came in hot.

23:27.515 --> 23:29.450
I don't think I'm ready
to talk about this yet.

23:29.484 --> 23:31.953
That's fair, I get that.

23:31.987 --> 23:33.788
But remember when you
came in from the bathroom

23:33.821 --> 23:35.690
and threw me on the bed
and then tried to rape me?

23:35.723 --> 23:38.359
I was like, "What's happening?"

23:38.393 --> 23:39.460
I'm going to take a shower.

23:39.494 --> 23:41.362
Ooh, like a "Silkwood" shower?

23:41.396 --> 23:42.697
Oh, my God.

23:42.730 --> 23:43.831
You know what, don't worry about it.

23:43.865 --> 23:45.333
I'll get in there with you.

23:45.366 --> 23:46.834
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:46.868 --> 23:49.304
Oh, maybe this worked out after all.

23:49.337 --> 23:52.840
Well, you haven't seen the way
I'm going to give you a shower.

23:52.874 --> 23:54.709
"We ask that all parents
please abstain from using

23:54.742 --> 23:57.412
any objectionable language
while on school premises

23:57.445 --> 23:59.915
just in case little ears are listening."

23:59.948 --> 24:02.317
Do you think someone
complained about my jokes?

24:02.350 --> 24:03.551
No, but the timing is conspicuous.

24:03.584 --> 24:05.320
Okay, you know what, this is so stupid.

24:05.353 --> 24:08.489
I'm not hiding, okay, I'm a mom
and I do comedy, okay?

24:08.523 --> 24:10.591
Nothing I am doing is hurting Amelia.

24:10.625 --> 24:13.494
Mommy, I just saw the funniest picture.

24:13.528 --> 24:15.063
What was it, Bugs?

24:15.096 --> 24:18.166
It was a weird lady
biting the tail of some animal.

24:18.199 --> 24:20.435
Oh, my gosh, um...

24:20.468 --> 24:23.939
That was a weird lady.

24:23.972 --> 24:27.708
Okay, maybe I can pull back a little.

24:28.342 --> 24:29.410
Sorry.

24:29.483 --> 24:34.483
