01:54.680 --> 01:56.680
Miss Emerson?

01:57.760 --> 01:59.000
Are you prepared?

02:01.480 --> 02:03.040
I brought this.

02:35.360 --> 02:38.080
Just get it ready. Get it ready.

02:56.560 --> 02:59.240
Life given. Life returned.

03:00.639 --> 03:03.200
Life given. Death lifted.

03:05.759 --> 03:09.280
Take this life force,
consume its flesh.

03:11.280 --> 03:13.200
Open our eyes to what is lost.

03:19.439 --> 03:22.000
<i>Memento mori. Memento mori.</i>

03:22.680 --> 03:26.040
<i>Memento mori. Memento mori.</i>

03:26.120 --> 03:29.280
<i>Memento mori. Memento mori.</i>

03:29.360 --> 03:33.600
<i>Memento mori.
Memento mori. Memento mori.</i>

03:39.759 --> 03:42.040
Who? Whose loss?

03:48.120 --> 03:50.040
This woman?

03:50.120 --> 03:52.600
This grieving woman?

04:04.039 --> 04:05.400
- Darling?
- Oh, God!

04:05.479 --> 04:08.400
Don't look away. You mustn't look away.

04:08.479 --> 04:11.760
Rose? Rose, darling.

04:13.719 --> 04:15.880
I can see you.

04:16.439 --> 04:17.920
I can see you.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.720
Life given. Death lifted.
Life given. Death...

04:22.800 --> 04:24.920
Get off me!

04:25.000 --> 04:27.440
Sergeant Evans, the curtains.

04:28.560 --> 04:29.880
The door! The door!

04:30.240 --> 04:32.160
- Stay there, Captain.
- Get off me!

04:32.240 --> 04:33.480
If you're a captain at all.

04:33.560 --> 04:35.240
Sergeant Evans, fetch the others.

04:39.720 --> 04:42.040
You bastard. You'll kill him!

04:42.439 --> 04:43.680
I’ll fetch a doctor.

04:43.759 --> 04:45.240
I’ll manage.

04:47.319 --> 04:49.640
- Ah! Ow!
- Another miracle.

04:49.720 --> 04:51.760
Miss Cathcart,
you shouldn't do that.

04:52.519 --> 04:55.400
Cathcart. Florence Cathcart.

04:55.480 --> 04:57.240
How dare you come here
under false pretences?

04:57.319 --> 04:59.200
Ls your soldier boy even dead?

05:02.480 --> 05:06.320
And this grotesque charade
won't bring him back.

05:06.399 --> 05:09.800
Neither will your blood capsules
which you slipped from your cup

05:09.879 --> 05:13.160
and your handkerchief as we started.

05:13.240 --> 05:17.200
Nor your free hand pulling the wick
from this woman's candle.

05:17.279 --> 05:19.960
As if the dead had
something against naked flames.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.920
You're charlatans.

05:23.519 --> 05:24.840
And poor ones at that.

05:27.040 --> 05:28.440
Get them out of here, Evans.

05:31.439 --> 05:33.720
Get off! You bastard.

05:52.519 --> 05:55.000
- I’ve got your brooch.
- Oh, thank you, Evans.

06:03.199 --> 06:04.800
Miss Cathcart, when you do these things

06:04.879 --> 06:07.160
you've taken to
ordering me around a little.

06:07.279 --> 06:08.600
I just think with you being...

06:08.680 --> 06:12.120
What, you don't want your colleagues
seeing you bossed by a civilian woman?

06:12.199 --> 06:15.640
Uh, I mean, if anyone was going to
order me around, it'd be...

06:15.720 --> 06:18.720
I mean, if Mrs Evans wasn't Mrs Evans...

06:18.800 --> 06:19.880
But she is.

06:19.959 --> 06:22.960
And she's very lucky, she is.

06:23.040 --> 06:25.560
I won't bully you any more. Promise.

06:28.759 --> 06:30.880
You've never had a child, have you?

06:33.000 --> 06:36.160
No, of course you haven't.

07:23.639 --> 07:25.880
- Allow me, miss.
- Thank you, Katie.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.680
It's all right.

07:38.360 --> 07:40.440
Oh, for heaven's sake. Um...

07:41.959 --> 07:43.720
- Who shall I make it out to?
- I'm sorry?

07:43.800 --> 07:45.640
- Please, Mr...
- Mallory.

07:45.720 --> 07:49.360
Mr Mallory, you'll excuse my brevity,
but this is my home.

07:49.800 --> 07:52.120
- Very glad you enjoyed the book.
- I didn't.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
- Excuse me?
- I didn't much like your book.

07:56.079 --> 07:58.320
I found it too certain.

07:59.519 --> 08:02.000
Perhaps that's only fitting
for someone so rude to strangers.

08:03.120 --> 08:07.000
I’m a history master
at a boy's prep school.

08:07.079 --> 08:09.160
Forgive my daughter, Mr Mallory.

08:09.759 --> 08:11.840
She's not taking on any more work.
She's quite exhausted.

08:11.920 --> 08:16.000
Um, let him speak, Harry. Please.

08:16.279 --> 08:20.480
Um, I’m afraid Harry's right.
I’m really not taking on any more work.

08:21.839 --> 08:25.080
But you are a ghost hunter
as well as an author?

08:25.160 --> 08:27.520
Well, you can't hunt
what doesn't exist.

08:28.279 --> 08:30.200
Ah, well, that's just it.

08:32.279 --> 08:34.039
We think we have one that does.

08:39.320 --> 08:41.080
I need to change.

08:41.159 --> 08:43.200
Katie, will you show
Mr Mallory to my study.

08:43.279 --> 08:45.280
- Yes, miss.
- I’ll be fine.

08:53.799 --> 08:55.480
You're fine?

08:56.080 --> 08:57.520
Mmm.

09:06.399 --> 09:10.400
We always know
why you throw yourself into this.

09:10.480 --> 09:14.720
And we don't blame you
for thinking that it will help.

09:15.639 --> 09:20.080
But every time now, all we can see
is the pain it causes you.

09:28.960 --> 09:30.480
Yes.

09:31.440 --> 09:34.160
I know. I'm sorry I keep
doing this to you.

09:35.279 --> 09:37.040
It's not fair.

09:56.480 --> 09:58.080
"May your skin be flayed from your body"

09:58.159 --> 10:01.080
"in the hell you so arrogantly claim
does not exist.'"

10:01.200 --> 10:05.080
An elderly woman in Dorset,
I seem to remember.

10:05.600 --> 10:09.160
Our school matron
is a devotee of your book

10:09.240 --> 10:12.240
and has told the headmaster
about the work you do.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.720
She assures him you're quite respected

10:14.799 --> 10:18.880
and your book sits alongside the Bible
on many bookshelves.

10:18.960 --> 10:23.040
Miss Cathcart,
rumour is a dangerous thing.

10:24.320 --> 10:28.680
Conversations in this room
are confidential, Mr Mallory.

10:28.759 --> 10:30.280
Especially if I don't take the case.

10:34.240 --> 10:36.480
Our school is called Rookford
in Cumbria.

10:36.559 --> 10:40.080
Some years ago, a child
was said to have been murdered there.

10:40.159 --> 10:42.800
Not a pupil.
It was a private house then.

10:42.879 --> 10:44.920
Well, who? Did they catch the killer?

10:45.000 --> 10:48.160
There's no record. It was
an important family. All hushed up.

10:48.240 --> 10:50.040
Still, it's perfectly possible
someone died there.

10:50.120 --> 10:52.960
So you're here about a death
that may or may not have happened

10:53.039 --> 10:54.520
however many years ago?

10:54.600 --> 10:55.880
No.

10:56.879 --> 10:58.960
I’m here about another death.

11:01.799 --> 11:05.480
A pupil. Three weeks ago.

11:06.120 --> 11:09.000
His name was Walter. Walter Portman.

11:10.159 --> 11:13.320
The day before he died,
Walter went to see the headmaster,

11:13.399 --> 11:16.360
quaking with fear,
convinced he'd seen a ghost.

11:16.440 --> 11:18.320
The ghost of the murdered child.

11:18.399 --> 11:20.680
Well, how did he know
what the murdered child looked like?

11:22.120 --> 11:23.920
This was taken 18 years ago.

11:29.360 --> 11:32.040
Mr Mallory, this is...
This is an old school prank.

11:32.120 --> 11:33.680
As the camera sweeps across
to expose the plate...

11:33.759 --> 11:36.200
One of the boys runs behind the row
to appear at both sides.

11:36.279 --> 11:38.520
He was still moving
when it reached him.

11:38.639 --> 11:40.360
I know. That was 1902.

11:42.960 --> 11:44.920
This was '03.

11:47.639 --> 11:49.200
'04.

11:50.200 --> 11:51.960
1905.

11:52.039 --> 11:53.960
And, lastly, '06.

11:54.759 --> 11:57.200
All the boys in the school
are accounted for.

11:57.279 --> 11:59.160
All of them. In all the photographs.

12:00.080 --> 12:03.600
Including this one,
taken just one month ago.

12:04.039 --> 12:06.440
Miss Cathcart, I can understand a child
running the length of the line

12:06.519 --> 12:09.560
in the 15 seconds it takes
for the camera to make its sweep.

12:10.399 --> 12:13.600
What I can't explain is
how he could get there.

12:24.360 --> 12:25.920
The Millford woman.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.240
Either a batch of partially exposed
photographic plates

12:29.320 --> 12:31.680
or the same ghost was
in my mother's potting shed.

12:31.759 --> 12:33.160
It's half-term in two days.

12:33.240 --> 12:34.960
We'll be lucky to get any of
the children back unless...

12:35.039 --> 12:37.440
I’m not interested in the
commercial fortunes of your school.

12:37.519 --> 12:40.000
There have been other sightings.
The boys believe...

12:40.080 --> 12:43.120
Boys believe in Santa Claus
and the Tooth Fairy.

12:43.200 --> 12:44.880
I’m sure some of them
even believe in God.

12:46.759 --> 12:49.040
You don't need me
to tell you what happened

12:49.120 --> 12:51.360
to that generation of boys, Mr Mallory,

12:51.440 --> 12:54.040
and yet you don't see their ghosts
stalking the halls of your school.

12:54.120 --> 12:57.560
Rookford is a boarding school,
Miss Cathcart.

12:58.440 --> 13:00.920
Most of the boys
are as good as orphans.

13:02.720 --> 13:05.240
I don't say that
just because of your circumstances.

13:05.320 --> 13:07.400
Well, then, why say it?

13:11.799 --> 13:14.120
"Fear is all I remember of my childhood."

13:14.559 --> 13:16.160
"I have glimpses of my parents' death"

13:16.240 --> 13:19.080
"but nothing of our life in Kenya,
nor coming to London."

13:19.159 --> 13:22.120
"Nothing but a feeling
of perpetual black terror.'"

13:23.759 --> 13:24.880
Your tactics are despicable.

13:24.960 --> 13:28.000
"Fear swallows children
and the adults we become.'"

13:29.440 --> 13:32.280
These boys aren't worried
about bumps in the night.

13:32.840 --> 13:35.520
They are frightened to death.

13:42.799 --> 13:44.440
Please leave.

13:48.639 --> 13:51.040
I was sent to request your help
and I've done that.

13:52.440 --> 13:54.720
You strike me as a woman who won't
do anything she doesn't want to.

13:57.399 --> 14:00.640
I’m at the Wellington Hotel.
Thank you for your time.

14:44.919 --> 14:47.120
<i>Semper veritas.</i>

14:47.240 --> 14:50.640
Latin gives a new school
an air of respectability.

14:50.720 --> 14:52.600
Means they can add a pound to the fees.

14:52.679 --> 14:55.360
And I should imagine a boney fide ghost
knocks it right off again.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.760
Latin puns. What fun.

14:58.840 --> 15:00.520
"Always the truth."

15:01.240 --> 15:03.200
Let's see, shall we?

15:03.279 --> 15:04.600
You can't wait.

15:04.679 --> 15:06.720
You're that keen that
people believe in nothing?

15:06.799 --> 15:08.640
No, without science
people don't believe in nothing.

15:08.720 --> 15:11.520
They believe in anything,
including spirits.

15:11.600 --> 15:14.400
So we need them. But you don't.

15:14.480 --> 15:17.640
I believe in evidence.
Need has nothing to do with it.

15:17.720 --> 15:19.720
And yet you carry
someone else's cigarette case.

15:21.519 --> 15:23.160
Touché.

15:26.200 --> 15:27.480
I’m sorry.

15:34.320 --> 15:35.920
Mr Mallory, am I...

15:43.559 --> 15:45.480
Go on.

15:46.960 --> 15:47.920
Judd.

16:12.960 --> 16:16.320
Hey! Knees, boys!

16:57.879 --> 17:01.440
Miss Cathcart, this is Miss Hill
the school matron. Maud to you and! me.

17:01.519 --> 17:03.720
- How do you do?
- Maud?

17:07.440 --> 17:09.560
She's taken this very hard.

17:10.680 --> 17:13.480
She's an odd fish at the best of times.

17:14.920 --> 17:17.440
For a start, she liked your book.

17:25.960 --> 17:27.319
I feel like I know you.

17:27.559 --> 17:29.320
I’ve read your book
a dozen times at least.

17:29.440 --> 17:31.800
It's on my bookshelf next to the Bible.

17:33.480 --> 17:35.600
I’ve never met an educated lady before.

17:36.079 --> 17:37.960
Not Cambridge and everything.

17:38.039 --> 17:40.320
Never mind someone famous.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.680
Oh, the Kaiser was famous, Miss Hill.

17:42.759 --> 17:44.120
I... I just wrote a book.

17:44.200 --> 17:45.720
Maud.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.480
Mr Mallory told you to call me Maud.

17:48.559 --> 17:50.120
Maud.

17:50.640 --> 17:52.440
- Hello.
- Hello.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.520
Did Mr McNair not say
all boys inside, Thomas?

17:57.599 --> 17:59.000
Tom.

18:01.880 --> 18:04.440
Everyone's nerves are shot to pieces.

18:08.039 --> 18:11.240
I’ve been here 14 years.
I know this place.

18:11.319 --> 18:14.240
And I don't hold with
any ghostly nonsense.

18:15.599 --> 18:18.480
I just wanted you to know

18:19.559 --> 18:21.360
I’m at your service.

18:29.079 --> 18:30.680
Hello.

18:32.279 --> 18:34.200
Stop it. Go on.

18:34.279 --> 18:37.080
Howell, stick up for yourself.
And get that hair cut.

18:37.160 --> 18:38.960
All of you, downstairs.

18:39.880 --> 18:42.040
Thank you, Maud. I’ll take
Miss Cathcart to the headmaster.

18:44.960 --> 18:47.360
Came with the building.
It's the boys' favourite.

18:47.440 --> 18:50.840
John the Baptist, I think. This way.

18:50.920 --> 18:53.440
It's actually Judith
slaying Holofernes.

18:54.519 --> 18:56.720
Story of a woman
who stole into the enemy camp

18:56.799 --> 19:00.320
and seduced then beheaded
their highest general.

19:00.680 --> 19:03.440
Hmm. Those were the days, eh, Maud?

19:06.599 --> 19:09.160
I’m not in, I’m out.

19:10.079 --> 19:12.720
At least I was out. Now I'm in.

19:13.480 --> 19:15.840
You must be the ghost lady.
Come through.

19:15.920 --> 19:18.440
Reverend Purslow,
this is Miss Florence Cathcart.

19:18.519 --> 19:21.560
An educated woman.
Well, well, well. Glad you're here.

19:21.640 --> 19:23.440
Presume you know
you've a matron to thank.

19:23.519 --> 19:25.640
So I believe. Glad I can be of service.

19:25.720 --> 19:28.200
Child dying before a parent.
Dreadful thing.

19:28.799 --> 19:30.280
I lost three of them.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.120
I imagine you don't believe
in the afterlife, Miss Cathcart.

19:34.279 --> 19:35.760
No, I don't.

19:36.519 --> 19:37.840
Terrible, isn't it?

19:39.480 --> 19:42.240
Mr Mallory will give
you a tour of the school.

19:42.480 --> 19:45.960
I’m on my way to the dining room
should you wish to see it.

19:55.640 --> 19:57.320
Mr Mallory.

19:59.079 --> 20:00.560
So I’m the guide now?

20:00.640 --> 20:03.080
He's coming. He's coming.

20:03.160 --> 20:06.920
After supper there's an hour of scrubs,
that's compulsory reading to you.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.480
OO.

20:10.079 --> 20:12.400
I’ll show you where Walter was found.

20:12.480 --> 20:15.960
I’d like to see everywhere
the boys claim to have seen the ghost.

20:16.039 --> 20:19.000
And perhaps you'd ask Maud to join us?

20:23.319 --> 20:26.720
Most of the sightings
were in here, including Walter's.

20:26.799 --> 20:30.960
Ln fact, he was found outside
here on the terrace.

20:33.279 --> 20:35.360
Many of the boys are now
too frightened to come in here.

20:35.440 --> 20:36.520
Mr Mallory.

20:37.119 --> 20:40.960
She doesn't like any superfluous sound.

20:44.720 --> 20:49.000
<i>"Ego contemno Latin."</i> I hate Latin.

20:49.559 --> 20:50.960
That you, Mallory?

20:56.720 --> 20:58.560
Walter was found there.

20:58.640 --> 21:01.120
Mr Broad found him
just before breakfast.

21:01.240 --> 21:03.520
- And these doors were locked?
- Mmm-hmm.

21:14.200 --> 21:16.680
Did he have a bear or a toy animal?

21:16.759 --> 21:19.320
- It's in the front office, yes.
- Could you?

21:27.960 --> 21:29.320
You don't like him.

21:30.960 --> 21:33.960
I have my reasons.
It would be indiscreet.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.440
Where are his glasses?
He used to keep up the pretence.

21:42.200 --> 21:45.960
Used to have a limp, too.
Kept him out of the trenches.

21:47.640 --> 21:50.680
- His mother couldn't bear to keep it.
- Thank you.

21:51.960 --> 21:54.320
And this was still on his bed
the morning he was found?

21:54.400 --> 21:55.880
Yes.

21:56.400 --> 21:58.520
You said there were other sightings
elsewhere in the house?

21:58.640 --> 22:00.640
Yes. Mostly in the west dormitory.

22:00.720 --> 22:02.880
Maud, perhaps I could
leave this to you?

22:10.440 --> 22:12.760
- Why aren't you at scrubs?
- My book, sir.

22:13.319 --> 22:15.160
Are you all right?

22:49.799 --> 22:51.400
And it's half-term tomorrow?

22:51.480 --> 22:54.880
Boys with parents in
far-flung places stay behind.

22:54.960 --> 22:57.840
Apart from that,
we have the place to ourselves.

23:06.920 --> 23:08.280
Was he bullied?

23:08.599 --> 23:11.600
They called him "Wheezy Walter".
He was asthmatic.

23:11.680 --> 23:13.200
Who were his friends?

23:14.640 --> 23:16.080
Did he have any friends?

23:16.160 --> 23:18.560
Miss Cathcart, this is a good school.

23:18.640 --> 23:21.840
But if you're different,
the wrong kind of different...

23:22.599 --> 23:25.200
His isn't the only mattress like this.

23:26.440 --> 23:29.000
"Then spake King Arthur
to Sir Bedivere."

23:30.240 --> 23:32.840
"The sequel of today unsolders all"

23:32.920 --> 23:35.640
"The goodliest fellowship
of famous knights."

23:36.359 --> 23:37.880
"'Whereof this world hold record."

23:37.960 --> 23:40.360
"Such a sleep they sleep,
the men I loved."

23:41.200 --> 23:43.120
"I think that we shall...

23:43.799 --> 23:46.240
"We shall never more, at..."

23:46.680 --> 23:49.360
"I think that we shall never more,
at any future time,

23:49.440 --> 23:52.880
"Delight our souls
with talk of knightly deeds."

24:02.400 --> 24:03.760
Dowden!

24:11.920 --> 24:13.440
Now.

24:18.079 --> 24:21.520
Matron, I presume you've brought this
young lady to my classroom for a purpose

24:21.599 --> 24:24.600
besides subjecting her to the
outrageous behaviour of Mr Dowden?

24:25.200 --> 24:27.640
Mr McNair. Boys,

24:27.720 --> 24:30.840
I know you're all upset and
frightened at the moment.

24:30.920 --> 24:34.280
Well, Miss Cathcart is here
to put your fears to bed.

24:34.359 --> 24:38.880
She's one of the cleverest people
in England. Miss Cathcart.

24:39.519 --> 24:41.200
Stand.

24:45.759 --> 24:48.520
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

24:49.559 --> 24:51.040
Sit. Please sit.

24:53.160 --> 24:57.560
How many of you did
Walter Portman talk to about this ghost?

25:00.720 --> 25:05.800
Well, did any of you
see this ghost boy for yourselves?

25:07.400 --> 25:10.440
I did, miss. I saw it.

25:10.519 --> 25:12.040
Stand, boy.

25:12.119 --> 25:13.600
Would you like to come with me
and describe...

25:13.680 --> 25:15.680
It was horrible.
It was on the upper corridor.

25:15.799 --> 25:17.240
- Wouldn't you rather...
- His face was twisted.

25:17.319 --> 25:19.160
Blurred and sort of twisted.

25:19.240 --> 25:20.440
Like in the photographs.

25:20.519 --> 25:23.600
But he was in pain. Crying out.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.440
It was him. Please kill it, miss.

25:26.559 --> 25:29.760
Yes, please. Kill it, miss.

25:29.839 --> 25:31.480
Silence.

25:32.880 --> 25:36.240
Pocket Premo,
12 exposure pack with meniscus lens.

25:36.319 --> 25:38.800
Sound recorder, part Bell-Tainter.

25:38.920 --> 25:41.480
Fumigator for measuring contact traces.

25:41.559 --> 25:43.880
Can Walter's dormitory sleep
elsewhere in the house?

25:43.960 --> 25:45.720
We could move their mattresses
to the dining room.

25:46.480 --> 25:49.000
Marconi magnetic field detector.

25:51.400 --> 25:56.120
Third of an ounce of magnesium
and potassium chlorate per tray.

25:56.519 --> 25:59.840
As the wire is tripped the aperture
opens for a thirtieth of a second,

25:59.920 --> 26:02.960
and an electrical charge
ignites the powder.

26:09.319 --> 26:12.320
- What about these?
- Those are footprint catchers.

26:13.200 --> 26:14.680
Ghosts have footprints?

26:14.799 --> 26:16.880
No, people pretending to be ghosts do.

26:16.960 --> 26:18.360
They must hate you.

26:18.480 --> 26:20.760
Who? The spiritualists?

26:20.880 --> 26:22.040
No, the ghosts.

26:39.920 --> 26:41.640
Be quiet.

26:42.519 --> 26:45.240
You'll be quiet or so help me!

27:21.359 --> 27:23.560
Victor, you did the run today.

27:24.759 --> 27:27.160
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

27:38.480 --> 27:40.000
What's this mess?

27:40.079 --> 27:43.080
Will she do what they say? The lady?

27:44.079 --> 27:46.000
And what do they say?

27:46.680 --> 27:48.080
That she'll kill the ghost.

27:48.519 --> 27:52.360
And that one boy a night will die
until she does.

27:52.440 --> 27:54.640
She's not here to catch ghosts.

27:54.720 --> 27:56.760
She's here to catch
naughty boys up to mischief.

28:06.119 --> 28:09.160
Silence now. Eyes closed.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.880
It'll be dark soon.

28:16.559 --> 28:18.080
Pary.

28:20.400 --> 28:21.720
Parry.

28:27.079 --> 28:28.560
Nobody...

28:28.640 --> 28:29.720
Likes...

28:29.799 --> 28:31.000
You!

29:00.240 --> 29:01.920
Be quiet.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.280
You'll be quiet or so help me!

34:20.000 --> 34:21.920
Shh! Keep still.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.520
Hello?

36:45.480 --> 36:48.000
I heard bells. Are you all right?

36:53.320 --> 36:55.560
First bell!

36:56.519 --> 36:58.320
First bell!

37:00.400 --> 37:03.960
Next three boys, please.
Quieten down.

37:07.159 --> 37:08.240
Next.

37:08.559 --> 37:10.920
Boys who have been seen
can go to their classrooms at once.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.560
They couldn't have
been made with socks?

37:12.639 --> 37:15.960
The prints I followed
were definitely barefoot.

37:16.360 --> 37:18.640
- Get back!
- Come on. Come on.

37:18.920 --> 37:20.520
Why are we here, sir?

37:21.159 --> 37:23.800
All right, turn around,
stick your feet up.

37:32.079 --> 37:33.400
Headmaster.

37:34.159 --> 37:35.520
Parry.

37:36.159 --> 37:38.320
- Sir.
- Parry.

37:38.480 --> 37:39.840
What would your father have thought?

37:39.920 --> 37:43.320
The night Walter died,
he got up to use the latrine.

37:43.400 --> 37:45.040
He wasn't wearing his spectacles.

37:45.119 --> 37:48.640
Mr Parry here frightened him,
using this to blur his face.

37:48.719 --> 37:50.920
I didn't. I didn't do it to Walter.

37:51.039 --> 37:54.160
And last night he tried to do
the same thing to me. Didn't you?

37:56.199 --> 37:57.600
Victor.

38:01.880 --> 38:03.920
They said if I did it

38:05.119 --> 38:06.520
then they'd be nice.

38:06.639 --> 38:09.320
- Stop snivelling.
- Malcolm, please.

38:10.679 --> 38:11.960
Who?

38:13.199 --> 38:14.440
- Them.
- Scab!

38:14.519 --> 38:15.960
- Quiet!
- But I didn't do it before.

38:16.039 --> 38:18.480
Not to Walter.
I liked Walter. We shared grots.

38:18.559 --> 38:19.800
- Victor.
- I didn't scare him.

38:19.880 --> 38:21.560
- No one knows who did.
- A boy is dead.

38:21.639 --> 38:24.360
- Wasn't me!
- All right, it wasn't just him.

38:24.719 --> 38:26.200
There was another boy last night.

38:26.800 --> 38:28.320
I saw him down in the stairwell.

38:28.400 --> 38:29.640
What?

38:29.719 --> 38:31.080
Dowden?

38:31.440 --> 38:33.320
- There wasn't another boy.
- Ah-ah-ah. You're behind this.

38:33.400 --> 38:35.160
- Honestly, sir.
- You will name this other boy now.

38:35.239 --> 38:36.960
There wasn't another boy. Please!

38:37.039 --> 38:40.200
You will name this boy or you'll be
thrashed where you stand. Mr McNair.

38:40.280 --> 38:42.480
Honestly. No, there wasn't
another boy, sir.

38:42.559 --> 38:45.720
Please, I tell you, sir.
There wasn't another boy!

38:45.800 --> 38:47.360
Please, sir, I promise,
it was only me!

38:47.440 --> 38:48.720
Wait, stop!

38:48.800 --> 38:50.400
Honestly,
I’m telling you the truth.

38:50.480 --> 38:54.120
For God's sakes. You've done quite
enough damage, you will not do this.

38:56.719 --> 38:58.360
What did you say?

39:00.440 --> 39:02.200
You use a balsam for your chest.

39:04.039 --> 39:05.680
I just smelled it on you.

39:05.880 --> 39:09.240
I also found it smeared on the glass of
the French doors and on the handles

39:09.320 --> 39:10.600
and on Walter's bear.

39:11.920 --> 39:14.680
You were... You were there
the night he died.

39:15.360 --> 39:16.640
I protest. This is...

39:16.719 --> 39:19.840
And did he protest
when you found him downstairs,

39:19.920 --> 39:22.240
ripped the bear from him
and left him out in the dark?

39:23.199 --> 39:26.600
I came here to protect children
from fear and you...

39:27.280 --> 39:29.120
You are hell-bent
on making them live in it.

39:29.199 --> 39:31.440
- You can't die of fear.
- No.

39:31.599 --> 39:35.440
But you can die of an asthma attack
brought on by it.

39:51.079 --> 39:53.960
- He was alive when I left him.
- Malcolm.

39:55.280 --> 39:56.880
He was crying,

39:57.840 --> 39:59.720
insisting he'd seen a ghost.

40:01.760 --> 40:03.240
I thought...

40:04.480 --> 40:06.480
I thought I'd toughen him up.

40:14.599 --> 40:17.600
It's not enough
to be mollycoddled, Robert.

40:19.639 --> 40:21.600
These boys must be strong.

40:24.559 --> 40:26.120
Stronger than us.

40:34.559 --> 40:38.080
Malcolm, there's not
a man on earth I’d rather protect.

40:38.840 --> 40:43.480
But the parents arrive shortly,
and I must ask you to leave this school

40:43.559 --> 40:44.880
at once.

41:17.519 --> 41:20.880
♫ Be still, my soul ♫

41:21.239 --> 41:25.520
♫ Though dearest friends depart ♫

41:36.599 --> 41:39.680
There was a chap in a trench
not far from ours.

41:39.800 --> 41:42.720
He used to sing this hymn most sunsets.

41:45.960 --> 41:48.320
It's odd separating the past
from the present.

41:54.159 --> 41:57.080
The boys are transformed.
You should be pleased.

42:02.639 --> 42:04.480
<i>Semper veritas.</i>

42:04.960 --> 42:07.080
- Mmm.
- Truth comes at a price.

42:08.840 --> 42:10.800
Ruined a damaged man.

42:10.880 --> 42:13.120
Oh, I’m not thinking about Malcolm.

42:14.039 --> 42:15.400
Nor are you.

42:17.199 --> 42:18.560
I saw you.

42:19.639 --> 42:21.920
As soon as you proved the ghost was
a fraud, something happened to you.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.400
- You were suddenly...
- Please, Robert.

42:27.840 --> 42:30.000
I’ve done what was asked of me.

42:31.199 --> 42:32.920
Proved there's nothing to fear.

42:36.800 --> 42:38.240
Nothing.

43:01.599 --> 43:03.200
You left church early.

43:05.039 --> 43:06.400
Mr Judd.

43:06.599 --> 43:07.960
You going home?

43:09.199 --> 43:10.600
Found your ghost?

43:13.000 --> 43:17.120
Another case to write up
while McNair's thrown to the dogs.

43:17.519 --> 43:18.880
After all he's been through.

43:21.920 --> 43:24.400
You know, I wonder
whether any of us really know

43:24.480 --> 43:26.120
what he went through, Mr Judd.

43:26.559 --> 43:28.880
- You shouldn't talk to me like that.
- Excuse me?

43:35.119 --> 43:38.240
- I’m sorry. I didn't mean to...
- You think I don't know?

43:38.960 --> 43:40.960
Staying at home was wrong?

43:42.719 --> 43:44.320
Come down here

43:45.119 --> 43:46.600
and tell me that?

43:46.679 --> 43:49.560
Let me tell you something, ghost lady.

43:49.840 --> 43:52.600
It's the living you wanna watch out for.

43:53.920 --> 43:55.320
Not the dead.

44:05.679 --> 44:09.200
There she is. Now try to forget
all about it. The headmaster will.

44:10.679 --> 44:13.880
Getting to go home. Cakes and puddings.

44:14.599 --> 44:16.040
Lucky beggars.

44:16.760 --> 44:19.000
Still, we'll have a nice time.

44:20.039 --> 44:21.480
You always say that.

44:22.400 --> 44:25.280
Lucky beggars. You always say that.

45:07.079 --> 45:08.280
No!

45:26.440 --> 45:28.080
There's nothing.

45:34.159 --> 45:36.120
There's nothing.

46:06.800 --> 46:09.360
Goodbye. See you in a week.

46:09.440 --> 46:12.400
Check the out buildings
before you go, Mr Baxter.

46:12.480 --> 46:14.320
There are gypsies on the Tarrow farm.

46:24.719 --> 46:26.720
Your ma and pa overseas, Tom?

46:27.119 --> 46:28.880
They live in India.

46:28.960 --> 46:33.080
Takes three weeks to travel to India.
They have tigers there.

46:34.320 --> 46:35.840
Goodbye, Matron.

46:36.239 --> 46:37.640
Mary.

46:38.840 --> 46:40.280
Have you been?

46:40.719 --> 46:42.080
No.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.520
No, but I’ve seen the lions in Africa.

46:46.639 --> 46:49.000
One of them even attacked me.

46:50.159 --> 46:52.880
How come you're not dead?

46:52.960 --> 46:55.800
Apparently I was rescued
by one of the villagers.

46:55.880 --> 46:58.000
Actually, a tribal chieftain.

46:58.519 --> 46:59.880
Did he kill the lion?

46:59.960 --> 47:01.960
I was very young. I think so.

47:03.239 --> 47:06.880
The villagers took me in
and looked after me until help came.

47:07.800 --> 47:10.160
They called me their "Mowa-Zee".

47:11.280 --> 47:12.680
White doll.

47:16.440 --> 47:18.920
I wonder what they'd think of me today,
seeing me in such a silly state.

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
- Tom, can you leave us now?
- Were your mother and father with you?

47:23.440 --> 47:24.800
Were they killed?

47:25.440 --> 47:26.760
Afraid they were.

47:26.840 --> 47:29.000
Tom, Miss Cathcart and I
want a grown-up conversation.

47:29.079 --> 47:30.520
I like grown-up conversations.

47:30.639 --> 47:32.000
Now.

47:34.840 --> 47:37.240
Goodbye, Mowa-Zee.

47:43.920 --> 47:47.120
Maud, it was an accident.

47:47.639 --> 47:49.120
I lost my cigarette case.

47:49.199 --> 47:51.040
How could someone like you
want to do such a thing?

47:51.119 --> 47:52.400
I don't want to talk about it.

47:52.480 --> 47:54.840
Don't go. Miss,
something has happened to you.

47:54.920 --> 47:56.400
You can't leave this house now.

47:56.480 --> 47:59.400
Please stop calling me miss.
It's Florence.

48:00.360 --> 48:02.080
And I can't stay here.

48:03.440 --> 48:05.000
I’m sorry.

48:21.400 --> 48:22.840
Thank you.

48:25.559 --> 48:27.160
I’ll be gone in an hour.

48:35.119 --> 48:36.480
I fell.

48:38.599 --> 48:39.960
I fell.

51:01.559 --> 51:03.320
I know you're there, Robert.

51:06.639 --> 51:08.200
Please don't go away.

51:21.679 --> 51:23.200
Don't go.

52:23.880 --> 52:25.760
<i>You must be the ghost lady.</i>

52:27.519 --> 52:28.920
<i>Come through.</i>

52:35.000 --> 52:36.520
Good evening.

52:36.599 --> 52:38.160
Good evening.

53:36.320 --> 53:38.200
<i>Be quiet.</i>

53:38.280 --> 53:40.200
<i>You'll be quiet or so help me!</i>

53:50.440 --> 53:52.000
Mr Mallory, I need your help.

53:52.079 --> 53:53.320
You're not going?

53:53.400 --> 53:55.120
Some of the equipment needs resetting.

53:55.199 --> 53:56.520
- Can I...
- I don't understand.

53:56.679 --> 53:58.800
You have your culprit.
You're doing more?

53:59.400 --> 54:01.200
- Oh, would you...
- No, thank you.

54:01.280 --> 54:03.080
Don't you like sherry?

54:03.159 --> 54:05.160
I need to keep my wits about me.

54:06.199 --> 54:08.320
I don't think
I shall ever drink alcohol.

54:08.400 --> 54:10.720
- It makes you cross and sick.
- Mr Judd,

54:11.360 --> 54:13.080
you're welcome to join us.

54:13.360 --> 54:15.480
Things to do, Matron.

54:16.159 --> 54:17.520
Mallory.

54:19.599 --> 54:20.960
Mr Mallory.

54:22.559 --> 54:23.920
Florence, what are you doing?

54:24.000 --> 54:26.240
I was brought here to explain
a phenomenon in this house,

54:26.320 --> 54:29.480
and whatever everyone else may believe,
I have yet to do that.

54:29.639 --> 54:32.920
A collective delusion
has been experienced here,

54:33.000 --> 54:36.560
a child moving through the house
as if there were no walls or floors.

54:37.840 --> 54:39.960
You said that a child was murdered here.

54:40.039 --> 54:41.680
What if that was also caused by...

54:41.760 --> 54:43.680
You're doing this because of a feeling?

54:43.760 --> 54:46.000
- This morning, you were...
- This is not a feeling!

54:46.679 --> 54:49.000
This is a thesis. It's science.

54:49.679 --> 54:52.680
- Tell me about the original murder.
- One can't even be sure there was one.

54:52.920 --> 54:56.280
- Something is causing this.
- Two hours ago, you...

54:58.079 --> 54:59.800
- Florence, why are you doing this?
- Florence.

55:05.159 --> 55:07.680
- What is it?
- A differential thermometer.

55:07.800 --> 55:10.920
It means this side of the corridor
has suddenly become

55:11.079 --> 55:13.160
much colder than that side.

55:13.280 --> 55:16.600
You said this was a private house.

55:18.199 --> 55:21.240
Housemaids often had hidden cupboards

55:21.320 --> 55:25.040
for mops and brooms and so forth.

55:30.599 --> 55:34.000
May even be stairs to the upper levels.

56:15.800 --> 56:18.000
I know this.

56:18.400 --> 56:19.760
It's an old nursery rhyme.

56:22.960 --> 56:25.520
Ladybird, ladybird,

56:25.599 --> 56:27.680
fly away home.

56:29.840 --> 56:31.600
Your house is on fire.

56:33.639 --> 56:35.360
Your children are gone.

56:39.800 --> 56:41.280
All except one.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.040
We need to work. Lock the house.

56:47.119 --> 56:49.360
- Florence, you don't need...
- Robert, lock the house.

56:53.760 --> 56:56.000
This is nothing,
it's a silly nursery rhyme.

56:56.079 --> 56:57.760
I’m frightened.

56:57.840 --> 56:58.840
Tom.

56:58.920 --> 57:01.240
- Tom.
- He wants to get me.

57:02.760 --> 57:05.000
Tom, nothing is going
to happen to you. Nothing.

57:05.840 --> 57:07.240
I promise you that.

57:08.599 --> 57:11.280
Now I must work.
I'll be upstairs if you need me.

57:51.360 --> 57:53.320
Can I sit with you? I won't talk.

57:53.719 --> 57:55.120
Of course.

58:03.760 --> 58:05.480
I get in trouble for talking.

58:08.280 --> 58:10.200
But I don't talk much.

58:12.079 --> 58:13.720
Did you have any friends at school?

58:15.280 --> 58:17.080
You can talk to me.

58:20.320 --> 58:23.400
I have make-believe friends. Sometimes.

58:23.519 --> 58:27.120
There's nothing wrong with that.
Many children do. I know I did.

58:28.079 --> 58:29.680
What was his name?

58:33.119 --> 58:34.840
I’m not sure he had a name.

58:36.320 --> 58:39.120
- Do yours have names?
- You're still lonely.

58:39.199 --> 58:40.560
Aren't you?

58:44.079 --> 58:45.440
I can tell.

58:45.920 --> 58:47.640
With the boys at school, too,

58:48.039 --> 58:49.680
I can tell.

58:52.400 --> 58:54.280
You had a real friend once.

58:55.159 --> 58:56.600
And you don't any more.

58:58.119 --> 58:59.920
Did you love him or something?

59:04.840 --> 59:06.400
Yes, I loved him.

59:08.239 --> 59:10.280
He was a very kind man,
a very good man.

59:17.480 --> 59:18.920
But I was...

59:20.679 --> 59:23.440
I did something
very silly and very cruel.

59:26.400 --> 59:29.560
I think I was frightened of losing him,
I loved him so much.

59:32.400 --> 59:33.920
He was in the war.

59:35.000 --> 59:36.520
What did you do?

59:37.840 --> 59:39.200
I wrote to him and told him

59:39.280 --> 59:41.640
I couldn't marry him
and I didn't love him any more.

59:43.280 --> 59:44.800
What did he say?

59:47.960 --> 59:49.480
He died.

59:51.320 --> 59:52.840
Not long after he got the letter.

59:53.039 --> 59:54.680
But you did love him.

59:55.920 --> 59:57.480
That's why you want him back.

01:00:11.719 --> 01:00:13.840
Thank you. Mowa-Zee.

01:00:23.039 --> 01:00:24.440
I don't think there's a place on earth

01:00:24.519 --> 01:00:27.440
people understand loneliness
better than here.

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:48.040
You're torturing yourself.
Is that what you're doing here?

01:00:48.159 --> 01:00:50.200
Proving again and again
that he's really gone?

01:00:50.719 --> 01:00:52.920
- Twisting the blade in deeper?
- You tell me.

01:00:53.079 --> 01:00:54.120
Why? Is it guilt?

01:00:54.199 --> 01:00:55.640
Preaching to me while
you rip your leg to shreds

01:00:55.719 --> 01:00:58.080
as if that'll make you feel better
for having survived!

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:05.800
You don't know what
you're talking about.

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:13.320
Robert.

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:16.160
I’m frightened.

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:18.240
And I can't live with that.

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:20.320
And yes, you're right,
what I do comes at a price.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:23.880
I hate myself more and more,
but I can't live with fear.

01:01:25.639 --> 01:01:27.280
I’d sooner be dead myself.

01:02:37.079 --> 01:02:40.000
Red four goes on the black five.

01:02:40.679 --> 01:02:43.480
Every card has its place.

01:02:43.559 --> 01:02:46.160
When they're back where they should be,
you win the game.

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:48.720
And that goes there.

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:52.280
That one there.

01:02:53.559 --> 01:02:56.360
Black eight can go on red nine.

01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:59.360
It takes time.

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:02.320
That's why they call it "patience".

01:03:10.119 --> 01:03:11.800
She's downstairs.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.840
- Mowa-Zee.
- Tom. Tom!

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:28.760
Tom!

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:36.200
I know it's you, Tom.

01:04:37.119 --> 01:04:38.680
I won't chase you.

01:04:39.239 --> 01:04:40.600
Keep playing.

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:21.840
Florence.

01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:31.800
Why are you doing this? You!

01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:33.520
I heard you giggle.

01:05:33.599 --> 01:05:34.960
- I heard him giggle.
- Florence!

01:05:35.039 --> 01:05:37.560
You took me to a man.
Who was he? Who was he?

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:40.680
There was a... There was a man!
There was... There was a man!

01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:41.800
Stop this!

01:05:42.599 --> 01:05:44.360
It's... It's all of you!

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:46.280
You're all doing this!

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:47.800
You, you...

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:49.920
You cruel and horrid little boy.

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:52.760
Florence!

01:05:53.719 --> 01:05:55.320
I hate you.

01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:00.600
Thomas Hill, you will come back here
at once and apologise.

01:06:00.679 --> 01:06:03.880
Stop bossing me around.
I haven't done anything wrong.

01:06:07.119 --> 01:06:08.960
I don't recognise you.

01:06:09.039 --> 01:06:12.320
I thought you were a kind,
loving girl but there's...

01:06:13.559 --> 01:06:15.240
There's nothing left.

01:06:20.599 --> 01:06:22.240
You're a shell.

01:06:37.079 --> 01:06:38.760
She's very troubled.

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:46.240
You have to understand that.

01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:53.600
She likes you very, very much.

01:07:01.639 --> 01:07:03.360
She doesn't care about me.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.040
I may as well be dead like Walter.

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:10.320
I hate her.

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:39.560
Robert, I need your help.

01:07:42.679 --> 01:07:45.800
He had a shotgun, and he was there,

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:48.440
and one of these will prove it.

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:57.160
I can leave an amber light on,
but are you...

01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:00.400
I’ll be fine.

01:08:12.519 --> 01:08:14.560
If you could just lift them.

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:18.720
That's good.

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:22.640
The dark used to bother me.

01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:26.800
Later, of course, it came to mean
safety, no sniper fire, or...

01:08:27.118 --> 01:08:29.399
- Thank you.
- ...shells, but

01:08:31.359 --> 01:08:33.640
as a lad I’d huddle into my bed,

01:08:35.359 --> 01:08:39.359
wanting to see what was there
but too frightened to open my eyes.

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:43.200
Thank you.

01:08:44.359 --> 01:08:47.800
It's never darker than when we close
our eyes and yet we keep them shut.

01:08:51.359 --> 01:08:52.760
Why is that?

01:08:55.118 --> 01:08:56.800
Thank you.

01:09:06.439 --> 01:09:10.000
The motion's not blurred,
so even if he's moving

01:09:10.078 --> 01:09:12.560
one of these will have him clearly.

01:09:13.158 --> 01:09:15.080
Why do you keep
your eyes closed, Florence?

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:22.160
Where is he?

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:27.880
Oh, God.

01:09:36.198 --> 01:09:37.680
No.

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:25.240
You're real.

01:11:29.479 --> 01:11:30.880
I am.

01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:40.400
Why are these things here?
What do they want with me?

01:11:50.039 --> 01:11:51.920
Maybe they aren't here for you.

01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:07.760
Tom, stay here. Do not leave this room.

01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:07.240
No! No! No!

01:13:56.039 --> 01:13:57.480
Open the door.

01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:20.080
Have you left this room?
Something's happened to Florence.

01:14:22.039 --> 01:14:23.640
- Promise me you'll stay here.
- All right.

01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:25.080
Tom!

01:14:25.159 --> 01:14:26.520
I promise.

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:31.880
Maud! Florence!

01:14:38.439 --> 01:14:39.800
I saw you.

01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:43.240
I saw you with him.

01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:45.200
The war hero.

01:14:45.439 --> 01:14:46.840
I don't know what you...

01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:51.080
I’ve seen plenty through these windows
making my rounds, but never that.

01:14:53.399 --> 01:14:57.120
Women. Just lap up
the sob stories, don't you?

01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:59.560
They were sent, you know.
They didn't sign up.

01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:01.600
Suddenly they're heroes.

01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:08.040
How dare you!

01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:11.360
You did nothing,

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:13.480
and you think you can mock men like him?

01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:15.200
You take care of what you're saying.

01:15:16.319 --> 01:15:19.400
You did... You did nothing
when men gave every...

01:15:52.439 --> 01:15:54.240
No!

01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:18.600
Robert! Robert!

01:17:19.239 --> 01:17:21.280
Whatever happened?
What's happened, Florence?

01:17:21.359 --> 01:17:23.680
- Florence, what is it? My darling girl!
- Florence!

01:17:25.239 --> 01:17:26.800
Judd attacked me.

01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:31.920
He tried to... He tried to...
I think I killed him.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.360
- I think I killed him.
- Maud, get a blanket.

01:17:34.439 --> 01:17:35.920
And run a bath. Now, please.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.760
Where? Where's Judd?

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:40.240
By the trees at the end of the driveway.

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:44.240
No, go inside. Get to Maud
and stay there. You hear?

01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:52.520
Robert. Robert, don't tell Tom.

01:17:53.239 --> 01:17:54.240
Tom?

01:17:54.359 --> 01:17:57.000
Little Tom. He's frightened enough.
He's the only child here.

01:17:57.079 --> 01:18:00.080
Florence, there are no children here.
It's just us three!

01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:03.280
What?

01:18:36.039 --> 01:18:37.520
<i>Mowa-Zee.</i>

01:18:39.239 --> 01:18:40.920
<i>Mowa-Zee.</i>

01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:48.160
<i>Mowa-Zee.</i>

01:19:05.119 --> 01:19:06.880
<i>Mowa-Zee.</i>

01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:41.160
<i>I didn't mean to
scare Walter that night.</i>

01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:46.240
I know.

01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:51.040
I believe you.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.640
You can control that?

01:20:21.319 --> 01:20:22.960
Sometimes I can.

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:26.400
But I don't know why he could see me.

01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:29.440
No one sees me.

01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:32.160
I can't make them.

01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:35.400
We see what we need to.

01:20:37.159 --> 01:20:38.720
He needed a friend.

01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:42.000
So did I.

01:20:42.079 --> 01:20:45.240
But you were frightened. When you
heard the music from that rabbit doll

01:20:45.319 --> 01:20:47.440
you said someone was going to get you.

01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:49.440
- Who were you frightened of?
- I can't tell you.

01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:52.040
Please. Tell me, please.

01:20:52.119 --> 01:20:53.760
You have to see for yourself.

01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:57.080
It's the only way we can be together.

01:20:58.439 --> 01:20:59.960
Again.

01:21:02.119 --> 01:21:03.560
What?

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:05.840
Promise you won't go away again.

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:08.160
Mousie.

01:21:08.359 --> 01:21:09.920
Mow-zee?

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:14.000
Look at the doll's house. Look at it.

01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:18.080
- No.
- You started to remember,

01:21:18.159 --> 01:21:19.320
- I know you did.
- No.

01:21:19.399 --> 01:21:20.720
Look at it. You'll remember the rest.

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:21.920
- Look at it.
- I don't want to look.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.280
You started to remember, I know you did.
Look at the house.

01:21:24.399 --> 01:21:27.160
- I don't want to look! Get away from me!
- Look at the house.

01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:41.160
<i>Mousie.</i>

01:21:41.239 --> 01:21:43.240
<i>You started to remember!
</i> You started!

01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:48.560
<i>You started to remember!
I know you did!</i>

01:21:49.279 --> 01:21:52.160
<i>But you go on and on!</i>

01:21:52.239 --> 01:21:55.600
<i>I don't even wanna look at you!
I can't live like this!</i>

01:21:56.039 --> 01:21:58.280
<i>Look at it.
You'll remember the rest.</i>

01:22:02.439 --> 01:22:06.520
<i>You don't know! You scheme
and you laugh at me and plot!</i>

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:09.920
<i>No one is plotting.
It's just that we can't care any more.</i>

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.920
<i>You make it impossible to care.
You don't speak for days.</i>

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.320
<i>You don't speak to me.
You won't even look at her.</i>

01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:19.960
Be quiet. You will be quiet,
or so help me!

01:22:23.159 --> 01:22:25.720
Your own child?
You despise her.

01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:28.280
- You're a monster!
- She's not a boy!

01:22:28.359 --> 01:22:30.640
She's bright,
and she's sweet, and she's...

01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:34.000
- Give me a son! Stay here!
- You have one!

01:22:39.239 --> 01:22:41.760
How do you think that makes me feel
watching your bastard boy

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:44.200
running around with... Your bastard boy
running around with Florence!

01:22:44.399 --> 01:22:46.440
Leave Tom out of this!

01:22:50.439 --> 01:22:52.680
Making us pay because you...

01:22:53.479 --> 01:22:54.760
Mummy! Mummy!

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:02.680
Stay back, Florence.
You can't help Mummy now.

01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:05.440
Move out of the way!

01:23:09.159 --> 01:23:12.680
You can't help Mummy now.
Move out of the way!

01:23:19.039 --> 01:23:22.320
You can't help Mummy now.
Move out of the way!

01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:33.360
I need you to move out of the way.

01:23:34.439 --> 01:23:36.120
Please, Daddy.

01:23:36.399 --> 01:23:39.600
Mousie, Mousie, run! Run!

01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:52.720
Think I don't know
your little hiding places?

01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:58.560
Know where my little mouse
hides herself for hours on end?

01:24:22.039 --> 01:24:23.680
Little Mousie.

01:24:34.479 --> 01:24:36.520
Little Mousie.

01:24:43.239 --> 01:24:45.280
I really am sorry, Little Mousie.

01:24:55.359 --> 01:24:57.400
I will find you, darling.

01:25:03.199 --> 01:25:05.520
You have to go with Mummy now.

01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:50.000
Mousie.

01:25:52.239 --> 01:25:53.600
Mousie.

01:25:56.279 --> 01:25:57.560
Little Mousie.

01:26:39.119 --> 01:26:41.000
You never said school.

01:26:46.159 --> 01:26:49.120
From the moment you arrived,
you called this place a house.

01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:53.560
You, nanny.

01:26:55.279 --> 01:26:56.640
Tom's mother.

01:26:56.720 --> 01:26:58.720
I thought bringing you here
would be enough.

01:26:59.399 --> 01:27:01.880
But you didn't remember me,
let alone the terrible things.

01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:05.280
I knew your little mind had
blacked it all out.

01:27:05.359 --> 01:27:07.640
But one thing kept me certain.

01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:10.160
You saw him.

01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:13.000
You saw my...

01:27:14.279 --> 01:27:15.640
My

01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:18.160
darling

01:27:19.319 --> 01:27:20.760
murdered child,

01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:26.840
who's lived here all these years
with friends he could never have.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:30.360
I was his friend.

01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:34.120
We shared everything.

01:27:35.119 --> 01:27:36.480
A father,

01:27:37.079 --> 01:27:38.440
everything.

01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:40.320
But you needed to see.

01:27:41.159 --> 01:27:44.560
That's why I sent Tom
to frighten you those times.

01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:48.520
To make you stay.

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:50.840
Because I know what's best for you.

01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:52.480
I always did.

01:27:54.039 --> 01:27:55.840
Because I raised you.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.480
I wet-nursed you.

01:27:59.159 --> 01:28:01.360
I watched you

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.320
taken away,

01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:06.520
adopted.

01:28:07.479 --> 01:28:11.600
You were ripped from me
like my boy had been.

01:28:15.319 --> 01:28:17.640
I never asked anything of the world.

01:28:19.119 --> 01:28:21.560
And it's a perfect hell on earth

01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:27.600
to give a woman children to love

01:28:28.479 --> 01:28:30.320
and to rob her of them.

01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:49.040
Little Tom.

01:28:50.439 --> 01:28:52.000
Little Tom.

01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:20.920
I’d forgotten everything.

01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:26.160
Well, perhaps not everything.

01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:29.720
"Eaten by lions."

01:29:32.239 --> 01:29:34.600
Well, all memories are
a hoax of some sort.

01:29:35.279 --> 01:29:38.040
You can't blame anyone
for letting you believe that one.

01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:40.440
Mmm.

01:29:45.439 --> 01:29:46.800
You needn't worry.

01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:50.840
No one will find Judd's body.

01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:56.040
I’ve buried better men than him.

01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:01.880
You see your own ghosts, too?

01:30:10.039 --> 01:30:13.480
Are they with us now?

01:30:23.239 --> 01:30:24.440
Your friends.

01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:30.880
They look like my friends.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.240
They don't have the right.

01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:36.720
No amount of guilt deserves
the pain you inflict on yourself.

01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:39.560
- They died. I lived.
- No, you didn't.

01:30:40.439 --> 01:30:42.040
A life haunted

01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:45.440
isn't a life at all.

01:30:47.039 --> 01:30:48.280
We may as well

01:30:50.319 --> 01:30:52.040
be ghosts ourselves.

01:30:58.039 --> 01:31:00.280
Light a fire, get some glasses.

01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:22.640
Someone once told me
it makes one cross and sick.

01:31:39.199 --> 01:31:42.040
Tom, what... What is it? What's wrong?

01:31:42.119 --> 01:31:43.960
Mother said it would be all right.

01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:48.240
She said that you would want us to.

01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:52.000
The loneliest boys are
starting to see Tom now,

01:31:52.079 --> 01:31:55.480
but will he listen to me?
Will he hide? He needs you.

01:31:57.960 --> 01:32:00.200
Maud, I’m going home.

01:32:00.279 --> 01:32:02.240
Imagine what a fright you gave me
going in the lake like that

01:32:02.319 --> 01:32:04.000
before you saw the truth.

01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:07.360
But it's all right now.

01:32:09.159 --> 01:32:10.960
Because he can have you forever.

01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:13.040
Everything in its place.

01:32:15.039 --> 01:32:16.400
Maud

01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:19.320
knows best.

01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:24.440
Robert!

01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:26.080
Florence?

01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:30.080
- Florence?
- Mr Mallory!

01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:33.760
Florence and I will be leaving now.

01:32:34.199 --> 01:32:36.680
Tom needs his family with him.

01:32:37.479 --> 01:32:39.440
Florence? Florence?

01:32:40.119 --> 01:32:43.320
Robert, the medicine cabinet
in Maud's room. Quickly.

01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:46.080
Something to make me sick.
Something to make me sick.

01:32:46.159 --> 01:32:49.120
Oh, God! No! No!

01:32:53.199 --> 01:32:54.560
Tom?

01:32:56.680 --> 01:32:58.320
Tom?

01:33:01.359 --> 01:33:05.720
Don't be angry,
I just miss you.

01:33:06.159 --> 01:33:07.920
All the time.

01:33:10.239 --> 01:33:13.680
My whole life I’ve never been happy,
not one second since you left me.

01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:18.720
But I can't... I can't... I can't come.

01:33:19.199 --> 01:33:20.560
You know that, don't you?

01:33:23.239 --> 01:33:25.200
You're the only friend I’ve ever had.

01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:31.000
But if I go with you now,
my soul will never be happy, and I...

01:33:32.239 --> 01:33:34.560
I can be, thanks to you.

01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:37.080
But you won't need me.

01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:39.440
No one will need me.

01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:42.880
Tom, you must be brave.

01:33:43.439 --> 01:33:47.160
Can you move through the house
like there are no walls?

01:33:47.279 --> 01:33:49.320
No walls and no floors.

01:33:49.399 --> 01:33:51.000
Help her, help her, help her!

01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:53.440
Then fly, little Tom.

01:33:55.399 --> 01:33:56.760
Fly.

01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:17.640
Are you dead?

01:34:19.119 --> 01:34:20.480
Are you dying?

01:34:21.199 --> 01:34:22.560
I don't know.

01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:25.280
I need to sleep.

01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:29.440
I need to close my eyes.

01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:32.160
I’ll stay with you.

01:34:33.119 --> 01:34:34.480
I promise.

01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:37.600
Even if you can't see me.

01:34:40.359 --> 01:34:41.720
I can...

01:34:42.199 --> 01:34:44.600
I can feel you now.

01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:42.880
I’ll tell the boys
it was an accident, of course.

01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:45.160
They'll be devastated. They adored her.

01:35:45.399 --> 01:35:47.520
We all did. Uh-uh-uh.

01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:51.840
I can only think the Walter incident
hit her harder than we thought.

01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:54.800
Mind you,
the Cathcart girl didn't help.

01:35:55.119 --> 01:35:57.320
I suspect she wasn't
altogether well herself.

01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:00.600
You know, I read a study last term.

01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:03.840
Ladies minds often can't cope
with further education.

01:36:18.319 --> 01:36:20.000
I know you're there.

01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:23.000
That's more than your headmaster does.

01:36:30.319 --> 01:36:31.960
I used to play here.

01:36:32.159 --> 01:36:33.560
Hide and seek.

01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:35.160
She would...

01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:38.840
Maud would sit over there.

01:36:48.079 --> 01:36:49.640
I’m thinking of writing another book.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.120
<i>The Interpretation of Ghosts.</i>

01:36:54.119 --> 01:36:56.120
Oh, God help us.

01:36:58.600 --> 01:36:59.960
Victor, do your laces.

01:37:04.359 --> 01:37:06.720
- Hello.
- Hello, again.

01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:11.400
Actually, Robert,
can you tell the driver to wait for me

01:37:11.479 --> 01:37:12.840
at the end of drive?

01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:14.280
I like the walk.

01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:16.280
I always have.

01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:18.880
Till Saturday week.

01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:30.160
Not seeing them...

01:37:32.119 --> 01:37:34.200
It's not the same as forgetting.

01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:39.440
It isn't.

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:54.360
- Hello.
- Hello.
