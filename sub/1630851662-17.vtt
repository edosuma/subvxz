WEBVTT

00:23.356 --> 00:25.608
What are you
playing at, brother?

00:25.692 --> 00:27.193
You are not my brother.

00:27.277 --> 00:29.529
What is
Vandal Savage up to this time?

00:29.529 --> 00:32.449
You are babbling.

00:32.449 --> 00:34.492
I am not a clone.

00:35.452 --> 00:37.120
Well?

00:37.120 --> 00:39.497
He is telling the truth...

00:39.581 --> 00:41.624
Or at least believes he is.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.209
Stay out my head, Martian!

00:43.293 --> 00:45.253
- You are certain?
- It was a cursory read.

00:45.253 --> 00:49.632
I didn't invade his
mind, but he has no
guards up. So. yes,

00:49.716 --> 00:53.136
- I am fairly confident.
- You poor bastard.

00:53.136 --> 00:55.180
You really do not
know what you are.

00:55.180 --> 00:57.307
You call <i>me</i> a bastard?
That is rich.

00:57.307 --> 01:00.977
<i>Think.</i>
Your memories of your
previous incarceration...

01:00.977 --> 01:02.854
Do they seem complete?

01:02.854 --> 01:04.355
Do they even seem real?

01:04.439 --> 01:06.816
You say you remember
the times I visited you here?

01:06.900 --> 01:08.067
Of course I do.

01:08.151 --> 01:09.778
Except I never did.

01:09.778 --> 01:11.988
I visited the prison,
a matter of public record, but

01:11.988 --> 01:15.158
I never came
to your cell to see you.
I was still too angry.

01:15.158 --> 01:17.577
That... That's a lie.

01:17.577 --> 01:19.704
It is not.

01:19.788 --> 01:23.082
- Your mind is not your own.
- I can help you

01:23.166 --> 01:24.751
if you'll let me.

01:26.044 --> 01:27.712
No.

01:27.796 --> 01:31.382
No. I don't know what game
you are playing, but
it will not work.

01:31.466 --> 01:33.718
Let us know when you are
ready to face the truth.

01:33.802 --> 01:37.472
I am not
a cl--

02:13.508 --> 02:15.468
Arion! Arion!

02:15.552 --> 02:18.263
Arion!

02:18.263 --> 02:20.723
Only the True King
can save Xebel!

02:20.807 --> 02:24.686
- Only the True King can save Atlantis!
- Give us our One True King!

02:24.686 --> 02:26.604
Give us Arion!

02:26.688 --> 02:28.898
- Arion at all costs!
- It has been weeks and still they chant his name.

02:28.982 --> 02:33.736
- I should have this so called Arion arrested for treason!
- Stop it, father!

02:33.820 --> 02:38.241
You must know such an
action could turn this unrest
into a full-blown revolution.

02:38.241 --> 02:41.369
And not just in Xebel,
but in every city-state
in the kingdom.

02:41.369 --> 02:45.498
Aye.
Even in Nanauve, the
people call for Arion.

02:45.582 --> 02:48.042
We had hoped to salvage
the situation here,

02:48.126 --> 02:50.545
but, I fear we may
already be too late.

02:50.545 --> 02:55.300
Now, finally, when your entire
kingdom is under threat,

02:55.300 --> 02:58.970
you deign to leave your
little bubble in Poseidonis.

02:58.970 --> 03:00.471
That is not fair--

03:00.555 --> 03:01.973
You are no better girl.

03:01.973 --> 03:04.434
When was the last time
the first daughter of Xebel

03:04.434 --> 03:06.769
set foot or fin in
the city of her birth?

03:06.853 --> 03:10.899
I hold you both responsible for
allowing this Arion to take--

03:10.899 --> 03:16.696
And what of your responsibility
Ryus Nereus? You have plotted
my overthrow for years,

03:16.696 --> 03:20.533
sowing the seeds of
this current crisis to
<i>both</i> our rules!

03:20.617 --> 03:23.870
- You dare speak to me that way in my own palace?
- Good!

03:23.870 --> 03:26.623
Settle it! I thought
I smelled royal blood

03:26.623 --> 03:27.999
- in the water.
- Enough!

03:27.999 --> 03:30.084
Fighting among ourselves
will not solve anything.

03:30.168 --> 03:33.546
And despite our suspicions,
Arion has done nothing wrong.

03:33.630 --> 03:37.133
In fact, he may very well be
the One True King that
fulfills the Prophecy.

03:37.133 --> 03:40.720
That prophecy cannot
be fulfilled without
Arion's lost crown.

03:40.720 --> 03:44.849
A definitive answer
to the question
of rule is impossible.

03:53.358 --> 03:55.485
Hear that?

03:55.485 --> 03:56.861
Locate.

03:59.197 --> 04:01.157
- On your right.
- Got it.

04:06.579 --> 04:08.831
Good.
Our response time improves.

04:08.915 --> 04:13.127
It should. We've been down here
ducking and dodging these
thermal vents for weeks.

04:13.211 --> 04:16.422
To be honest, I did
not expect the search to go on

04:16.506 --> 04:18.341
- for so long.
- None of us did.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.176
Neptune's beard.

04:20.176 --> 04:22.553
Coral is due to give
birth soon, assuming
she hasn't already.

04:22.637 --> 04:25.056
- If we don't find the damn crown soon--
- La'gaan,

04:25.056 --> 04:27.100
no one forced you to
accept this assignment.

04:27.100 --> 04:31.354
Either you are here one
hundred percent, or you need
to swim away.

04:31.354 --> 04:32.522
Right.

04:32.522 --> 04:33.982
Sorry.

04:33.982 --> 04:35.233
I'm here, Kaldur.

04:35.233 --> 04:37.860
- One hundred percent.
- Then we press on

04:37.944 --> 04:40.697
by foot or by fin,
till the job is done.

04:47.453 --> 04:49.539
Do not take it too
hard, my friend.

04:49.539 --> 04:53.126
- His words are harsh, but...
- I know I just wish I had his strength sometimes.

04:53.126 --> 04:57.880
He is strong... But he is
also exhausted, and has
been for some time.

04:57.964 --> 05:00.717
Plus, the death of Conner Kent
has hit him particularly hard.

05:00.717 --> 05:03.052
Of course.

05:03.136 --> 05:07.390
For years I held a grudge
against Conner, a petty,
immature grudge.

05:07.390 --> 05:11.227
I never made amends,
and it hurts, knowing
I'll never get the chance.

05:11.227 --> 05:15.231
I can't imagine Kaldur's
pain... Or M'gann's.

05:15.231 --> 05:17.233
I just wish I knew
how to help.

05:17.233 --> 05:18.860
So do I.

05:18.860 --> 05:21.237
Kaldur holds so much inside.

05:21.237 --> 05:23.114
I'm afraid it is only
a matter of time

05:23.114 --> 05:26.576
before all that he
keeps buried, rises
up to overtake him.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.203
Hear that?

05:29.287 --> 05:30.413
Locate.

05:44.761 --> 05:51.100
Arion!
Arion! Arion! Arion!

05:51.184 --> 05:55.271
Though I wish
it were under different circumstances,

05:55.271 --> 05:58.941
this Conference of Delegates
will now come to order.

05:59.025 --> 06:02.278
Emissary Coral of Neptunos
is not in attendance?

06:02.278 --> 06:04.530
She is
in labor, Your Highness.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.407
How wonderful.

06:06.491 --> 06:11.079
Indeed. And in her absence,
she has granted me her proxy.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.498
Her proxy? To what end?

06:13.498 --> 06:16.542
Well, we all presumed this
meeting would end with a vote.

06:16.626 --> 06:18.294
A vote for what?

06:18.294 --> 06:21.255
For High King of Atlantis

06:30.473 --> 06:32.016
Relax into my current!

06:38.606 --> 06:40.733
I cannot overcome it!

06:40.817 --> 06:42.235
Keep fighting!

06:54.330 --> 06:55.665
La'gaan!

07:05.883 --> 07:08.678
Neptune's beard!
That's how it's done.

07:08.678 --> 07:11.430
- Good work.
- Kaldur, look.

07:20.523 --> 07:23.109
- I can't see a thing.
- Allow me

07:28.865 --> 07:32.243
This is why we
haven't found the crown.
Over the millennia...

07:32.243 --> 07:33.744
The ocean floor shifted.

07:33.828 --> 07:36.539
Atlantis' original
capital sank even deeper.

07:36.539 --> 07:39.167
By the Gods...

07:39.167 --> 07:40.501
Whoa.

07:40.585 --> 07:42.753
Someone was in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

07:42.837 --> 07:45.715
Huh. I wonder who
she or he was?

07:47.175 --> 07:50.428
There is powerful magic
in these ruins. This way.

07:51.846 --> 07:53.598
It's getting stronger.

07:53.598 --> 07:56.517
Yeah. I think I'm feeling
what you're feeling.

07:56.601 --> 08:00.897
As am I.
Together, we should be
able to triangulate the source.

08:10.656 --> 08:11.991
There!

08:16.621 --> 08:17.914
Is that it?

08:17.914 --> 08:20.374
That <i>must</i> be it. Arion's Crown!

08:20.458 --> 08:22.168
The Crown of Prophecy.

08:29.425 --> 08:31.552
Oh, man, not another one!

08:37.683 --> 08:40.770
Orin! Orin, are you there?

08:40.770 --> 08:42.605
Do you hear me?

08:42.605 --> 08:45.024
Answer me!

08:45.024 --> 08:47.944
The High King is
otherwise occupied.

08:47.944 --> 08:49.445
That is fine.

08:49.445 --> 08:51.489
You are the one I sought.

08:52.573 --> 08:53.574
I--

08:54.617 --> 08:55.993
I want the truth.

08:56.077 --> 08:59.288
That is all any of us wants.

08:59.372 --> 09:02.500
Now relax, and open
your mind to me.

09:05.127 --> 09:06.170
Hmm.

09:06.254 --> 09:08.923
<i>I recognize Psimon's mindtouch.</i>

09:08.923 --> 09:13.094
<i>In fact, his fingerprints are
all over your psyche.</i>

09:13.094 --> 09:15.263
<i>He's masked his work from you-</i>

09:15.263 --> 09:17.390
<i>but not from me.</i>

09:17.390 --> 09:19.517
<i>I can take you back</i>

09:19.517 --> 09:23.813
<i>to your first, true memory.</i>

09:26.482 --> 09:29.777
The force-growth is almost complete?

09:29.777 --> 09:32.738
I assume now he'll fade in
and out of consciousness

09:32.822 --> 09:35.283
until activated?

09:35.283 --> 09:37.702
Fine. But he's seen us.

09:37.702 --> 09:41.789
Make certain Psimon erases this memory.

09:44.500 --> 09:47.295
Arion!
Arion! Arion! Arion!

09:47.295 --> 09:49.338
I never wanted this.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.841
But perhaps, for the
sake of Atlantis,

09:51.841 --> 09:54.844
I must once again take up
the mantle of leadership.

09:54.844 --> 09:57.388
With all due respect,
Lord Arion,

09:57.388 --> 09:59.765
Atlantis already has a leader.

09:59.849 --> 10:03.853
I am sorry, my queen,
but the people disagree.

10:03.853 --> 10:08.149
King Orin is a great hero, but
Atlantis has never taken to him

10:08.149 --> 10:10.484
as Annax, except in Poseidonis.

10:10.568 --> 10:12.361
Lord Arion, on the other hand,

10:12.445 --> 10:16.032
has rallied everyone around him
by twice saving Atlantis,

10:16.032 --> 10:18.367
and he seems to
fulfill the prophecy.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.702
That is secondary.

10:19.702 --> 10:21.078
Let us face the truth.

10:21.162 --> 10:23.831
The people are on the
verge of open rebellion.

10:23.831 --> 10:25.708
If we are each to
maintain control

10:25.708 --> 10:28.085
over our own City-State,
we must

10:28.169 --> 10:31.047
elect Arion High King.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.674
Both subjects have received the
Psy-Back transfer,

10:33.758 --> 10:35.926
with Ocean-Master's
memory engrams,

10:36.010 --> 10:39.388
recorded just before
his incarceration?

10:39.472 --> 10:40.723
Excellent.

10:40.723 --> 10:44.185
Then Project <i>Thrinos</i>
may proceed.

10:44.185 --> 10:46.103
Release Ocean-Master.

10:51.150 --> 10:52.526
So,

10:52.610 --> 10:55.071
in order to protect
your positions of power,

10:55.071 --> 10:58.032
you would hand our Kingdom
to someone you know almost

10:58.032 --> 11:01.869
- nothing about?
- I appreciate all Arion has done,

11:01.869 --> 11:04.747
but to even contemplate
giving him the Crown...

11:04.747 --> 11:07.750
Orin, you do not
have to do this.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.211
I am a king, not a dictator.

11:10.211 --> 11:12.963
And serve at the
behest of the people.

11:13.047 --> 11:15.716
All those in favor of
Arion as Annax

11:15.800 --> 11:17.134
say, "Aye."

11:17.218 --> 11:18.427
Aye.

11:18.511 --> 11:21.472
Aye.

11:21.472 --> 11:25.393
And as Emissary Coral's
proxy, I say "Aye" on her

11:25.393 --> 11:27.770
- behalf, as well.
- Aye.

11:27.770 --> 11:30.356
Well... At least he's powerful.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.108
- Aye.
- Nay!

11:32.108 --> 11:33.609
Father!

11:33.609 --> 11:37.238
This is... Unexpected.
Thank you for your support.

11:37.238 --> 11:40.616
I am not supporting Orin!
I am voting for myself!

11:40.616 --> 11:43.994
Six votes for Arion.
One for Nereus.

11:44.078 --> 11:47.331
Even without my vote,
the result is forgone.

11:47.415 --> 11:50.000
Arion is High King.

11:52.336 --> 11:54.547
I pray your decision
is the right one...

11:54.547 --> 11:56.382
For all our sakes.

12:00.386 --> 12:04.932
Amazing that my
grandson's flute contained a
recoverable sample of his DNA.

12:04.932 --> 12:08.811
Being the first of the Homo
Magi and an immortal,

12:08.811 --> 12:12.314
his body will have a
substantial affinity to magic.

12:12.398 --> 12:16.986
Considerably more substantial
than your previous body, Orm.

12:16.986 --> 12:19.363
For that, you have my undying,

12:19.447 --> 12:22.450
<i>literally</i> undying, gratitude.

12:22.450 --> 12:25.369
You understand why
we had to kill you?

12:25.453 --> 12:29.582
Yes. I was out
of control. Apologies.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.584
Accepted, tentatively.

12:31.584 --> 12:35.004
This is your chance to redeem
yourself before the Light

12:35.004 --> 12:39.175
and achieve everything I have
ever dreamt of. Thank you.

12:39.175 --> 12:42.595
You will need to memorize
everything I know about
Arion's life.

12:42.595 --> 12:46.015
In addition, your training
with Wotan is paramount.

12:46.015 --> 12:49.185
In the past, you were too
reliant on Neptune's Trident.

12:49.185 --> 12:52.855
From now on, you shall
wield Arion's power
without such trinkets.

12:52.855 --> 12:56.942
- Understood.
- Psimon will soon begin to edit this one's memories,

12:57.026 --> 12:59.695
creating a false history
to cover his incarceration,

12:59.695 --> 13:03.908
and the time since. He will be
pre-programmed to lose to you

13:03.908 --> 13:05.493
and draw suspicion his way.

13:05.493 --> 13:08.829
The puppet will end up in
prison or dead,

13:08.913 --> 13:11.957
no longer of any
use or concern.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.961
I'm sorry.

13:16.045 --> 13:18.881
What they did to you...
It's unforgivable.

13:18.881 --> 13:22.051
I must inform the King
before it's too late

13:22.051 --> 13:25.763
- Arion! Arion! Arion! Arion!
- The people

13:25.763 --> 13:29.767
will wish to hear from the
new High King of Atlantis,

13:29.767 --> 13:32.311
Annax Arion.

13:42.071 --> 13:44.281
- Delphis! Douse your light.
- Right.

13:47.201 --> 13:48.786
Come to me, beast.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.876
Everyone aboard!

13:55.960 --> 13:59.046
Guess it can't eat us
if we're riding it, right?

13:59.630 --> 14:00.923
Right?

14:14.103 --> 14:15.396
Hold on!

14:21.777 --> 14:22.987
Now!

14:32.204 --> 14:33.664
Go! Go!

14:39.837 --> 14:42.673
Whew. I thought
we'd never exit those depths.

14:42.673 --> 14:44.967
Do we radio King
Orin we have the Crown?

14:44.967 --> 14:48.429
- He commanded radio silence.
- Hear me.

14:48.429 --> 14:51.140
Hear me, my children.

14:51.140 --> 14:54.852
Hear your new, old High King...

14:55.561 --> 14:57.146
With reluctance,

14:57.146 --> 15:01.442
I have accepted your call
to lead our people...

15:01.442 --> 15:04.987
And return
Atlantis to the glory of

15:04.987 --> 15:06.614
its forebears.

15:06.614 --> 15:08.699
I'm sorry we didn't
get the intel sooner. But.

15:08.699 --> 15:12.786
- if you outed him--
- Were I to reveal all now, no one would believe me.

15:12.870 --> 15:15.205
This is a responsibility
I assume

15:15.289 --> 15:18.083
with the full support
of your former Annax

15:18.167 --> 15:21.295
and the leaders of all...

15:21.962 --> 15:22.838
Ah.

15:22.838 --> 15:24.465
Kaldur'ahm.

15:24.465 --> 15:29.053
I believe you have
something that
belongs to me.

15:34.516 --> 15:35.809
This is hybris.

15:35.893 --> 15:37.061
Do not put it on, brother.

15:37.061 --> 15:38.729
We are not brothers.

15:38.729 --> 15:41.273
We were never brothers.

15:41.357 --> 15:44.109
My lost crown!

15:44.193 --> 15:47.363
The Prophecy fulfilled!

16:06.131 --> 16:07.341
Yes...

16:07.341 --> 16:08.509
Orm!

16:08.509 --> 16:10.594
No, no!

16:42.835 --> 16:45.295
It has been drained of power.

16:45.379 --> 16:50.217
Here is all the proof
you need that this
'Lord Arion' was false.

16:50.217 --> 16:54.054
False to the Prophecy. False
to the Kingdom of Atlantis.

16:54.138 --> 16:56.557
False to all of us.

16:56.557 --> 16:59.768
Let this be the moment
that we as a people,

16:59.852 --> 17:03.105
trust in ourselves and not in
false prophets.

17:03.105 --> 17:07.651
Annax Orin, my husband,
is your true High King!

17:16.368 --> 17:19.788
No, my love. This is not right.

17:19.872 --> 17:23.625
I am not the king
that was foretold.

17:23.709 --> 17:27.546
It is Queen Mera who
fulfills the Prophecy!

17:27.546 --> 17:29.173
Arion may have
been the stranger

17:29.173 --> 17:31.717
and herald, the conqueror
of Neptune's Trident.

17:31.717 --> 17:37.139
But it was Arion, Orm and
Mera together who faced
down the Red Death.

17:37.139 --> 17:42.936
And the Prophecy
clearly states: "When best
of these gains Arion's Crown,

17:43.020 --> 17:46.064
our one True King
revives renown."

17:46.148 --> 17:51.653
Can anyone doubt
that Mera Nereus is
the best of those three?

17:51.737 --> 17:56.658
Can anyone doubt
that Mera Nereus is
the best of us all?

17:56.742 --> 17:58.994
It is Mera Nereus,

17:58.994 --> 18:02.915
Princess, Queen and Sorceress,

18:02.915 --> 18:06.418
who must be our High King.

18:06.502 --> 18:12.216
Mera! Mera! Mera! Mera!

18:14.051 --> 18:15.344
What say you?

18:15.344 --> 18:18.680
- Aye!
- Now, she's an Annax

18:18.764 --> 18:21.016
- I can respect.
- Aye.

18:21.016 --> 18:23.185
It is unanimous.

18:23.185 --> 18:24.728
No, Orin, no.

18:24.812 --> 18:26.563
Let us be honest.

18:26.647 --> 18:30.317
The Crown, any crown,
never sat easily upon
my head.

18:30.317 --> 18:34.488
You were raised in a Palace,
taught what it meant to rule.

18:34.488 --> 18:38.826
I was raised in a lighthouse
to a very different destiny.

18:38.826 --> 18:42.704
It is as it must be, my love.

18:54.800 --> 18:58.387
It is time for our long
cataclysm to end.

18:58.387 --> 19:03.892
Atlanteans, all Atlanteans,
must be reunited as one people.

19:03.976 --> 19:07.855
And our Seven Seas
as one World Ocean,

19:07.855 --> 19:13.026
and all eight city states
will feel the benefits
of our rule.

19:13.110 --> 19:16.071
All hail High King Mera!

19:21.285 --> 19:25.414
Annax Mera! Annax Mera!

19:25.414 --> 19:28.083
Annax Mera!
Annax Mera!

19:28.083 --> 19:32.087
Annax Mera! Annax Mera!

19:42.306 --> 19:45.976
Looks like you you didn't need
to worry about Kaldur.
I mean, the way he took

19:45.976 --> 19:48.770
on that Leviathan!
He was a total bad ass!

19:48.854 --> 19:51.106
Kaldur has training, talent
and natural instincts.

19:51.106 --> 19:53.192
Of course, he's a
bad-ass when necessary,

19:53.192 --> 19:57.446
but I fear he will use
this success as another
excuse not to rest.

19:57.446 --> 20:01.450
What will you do next,
Annax... Lord Orin?

20:01.450 --> 20:04.286
Raise my son.
Support my wife and her rule.

20:04.286 --> 20:06.955
And, I believe I will also
rejoin the Justice League.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.625
I will, of course, relinquish
the title of Aquaman.

20:09.625 --> 20:13.378
If the League can include four
Green Lanterns and two Flashes,

20:13.462 --> 20:16.632
I believe it can embrace
two Aquamen...

20:16.632 --> 20:18.383
Or three.

20:18.467 --> 20:20.010
Wait. Really?

20:20.010 --> 20:21.803
It is time.

20:21.887 --> 20:25.307
Congratulations, my friend.
And it is a relief
it happens now.

20:25.307 --> 20:28.560
as I have decided I must
take a leave of absence.

20:29.227 --> 20:30.687
It is time.

20:46.787 --> 20:49.039
Come to gloat, my son?

20:49.039 --> 20:52.834
You should hardly be surprised
at the result, Father.

20:52.918 --> 20:58.090
The Lords of Order would
never have allowed their
Crown to be used by your agent.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.300
Then they are fools.

21:00.384 --> 21:03.345
My Project <i>Thrinos</i> would
have brought order to
three-fourths of the globe.

21:03.345 --> 21:04.972
We will not argue.

21:04.972 --> 21:09.351
The Book of Chaos you opened
upon Atlantis millennia ago

21:09.351 --> 21:11.520
has reached its final chapter.

21:11.520 --> 21:14.189
Now a new story begins,

21:14.189 --> 21:17.567
one without Vandal Savage.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.707
It's done.

21:31.707 --> 21:35.544
Your mind is now clear
of all programming,
and outside influence

21:35.544 --> 21:36.962
Thank you.

21:37.921 --> 21:40.257
Here. You are free to go.

21:40.257 --> 21:42.175
- I don't understand.
- You cannot be held

21:42.259 --> 21:44.553
responsible for the crimes
of the original Orm,

21:44.553 --> 21:48.056
nor for crimes committed
while your mind was
enslaved by the Light.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.725
Your slate is clean,

21:49.725 --> 21:53.020
and I would love nothing more
than to give you a second...

21:53.020 --> 21:56.064
Or, really, a first chance.

21:56.148 --> 22:00.068
If you want one, you know
where to find me, brother.

22:09.077 --> 22:12.205
<i>The first time I took
a breath of air on the surface,</i>

22:12.289 --> 22:15.917
<i>I thought I would choke.
Yet despite my fears,</i>

22:16.001 --> 22:17.294
<i>when my moment came,</i>

22:17.294 --> 22:19.254
<i>my gills relaxed,</i>

22:19.254 --> 22:21.590
<i>my lungs expanded,</i>

22:21.590 --> 22:25.260
<i>and I realized I would never
need to hold my breath.</i>

22:26.595 --> 22:28.555
<i>But truthfully,</i>

22:28.555 --> 22:32.726
<i>I find I have been holding
a great deal inside for
a very long time.</i>

22:39.649 --> 22:41.693
I know, Ghosty.

22:43.236 --> 22:44.321
I know.

22:46.656 --> 22:48.158
I failed you.

22:48.158 --> 22:49.618
Be careful, Connor.

22:49.618 --> 22:51.078
Always.

22:55.082 --> 22:57.459
<i>I failed M'gann...</i>

22:57.459 --> 22:59.294
<i>I'm out of control...</i>

23:00.170 --> 23:02.631
<i>An animal, a beast...</i>

23:02.631 --> 23:03.840
<i>It's who I am...</i>

23:03.924 --> 23:05.634
We are
trying to help you...

23:07.719 --> 23:11.139
<i>Who I've always been.
Superman knew.</i>

23:11.223 --> 23:13.016
<i>He always knew.</i>

23:13.100 --> 23:14.226
Stop it.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.853
Stop! <i>- And now I've killed him.</i>

23:18.480 --> 23:19.981
I've killed my brother!

23:27.656 --> 23:28.782
Hey. Wait.

23:28.782 --> 23:32.786
Wait!
Help me...

23:32.786 --> 23:34.162
Please...

23:35.705 --> 23:37.082
There was a bus.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.919
The bus from the bridge...

23:42.212 --> 23:44.172
Oh, god!

23:44.256 --> 23:45.674
I'm losing my mind...

23:49.302 --> 23:50.971
Red Sun.

24:02.816 --> 24:05.152
It was
ten years ago today.

24:05.777 --> 24:07.863
Of course.

24:07.863 --> 24:11.366
Robin and Kid Flash
and I did something

24:11.366 --> 24:12.784
rather stupid.

24:14.119 --> 24:16.121
Something that nevertheless,

24:16.121 --> 24:20.709
I have spent a decade regarding
with over-weening pride.

24:20.709 --> 24:24.004
We rescued Superboy
from Cadmus,

24:24.004 --> 24:28.383
created something that became
a turning point in my life.

24:28.383 --> 24:29.676
The Team.

24:31.303 --> 24:32.971
And now,

24:32.971 --> 24:35.515
ten years later,

24:35.599 --> 24:39.644
So many of my teammates
have paid the price
of my hybris.

24:41.021 --> 24:42.397
Tula is dead.

24:43.106 --> 24:44.733
Jason is dead.

24:44.733 --> 24:46.568
Wally is dead.

24:47.777 --> 24:49.070
Conner is dead.

24:49.863 --> 24:51.865
These are sorrows,

24:51.865 --> 24:53.825
I must come to terms with...

24:55.827 --> 24:58.288
if I am ever to return
to the life I have led.
