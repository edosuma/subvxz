WEBVTT

00:00.757 --> 00:03.217
My name is Elena Gilbert.
I'm a vampire.

00:03.750 --> 00:06.819
â™ª

00:06.820 --> 00:08.720
You're sired to me, Elena.
Everything you think you fell,

00:08.721 --> 00:09.971
might not even be real.

00:09.972 --> 00:11.589
But there's
hope now.

00:11.590 --> 00:12.873
Tell them what the hunter
told you the tattoo leads to.

00:12.874 --> 00:14.475
He said there was
a cure.

00:14.476 --> 00:16.678
Everyone wants it
for a different reason.

00:16.679 --> 00:17.896
For revenge...

00:17.897 --> 00:19.186
Ohh!

00:19.649 --> 00:22.183
To be human
an in love...

00:22.184 --> 00:23.284
For the truth...

00:23.285 --> 00:24.775
I'm setting you
free, Elena.

00:25.322 --> 00:27.156
And some will
stop at nothing to get it.

00:27.157 --> 00:28.740
Do it!

00:34.730 --> 00:39.167
Carol Lockwood
always said that togetherness,

00:39.168 --> 00:40.952
in times of tragedy,

00:40.953 --> 00:43.738
leads to healing.

00:43.739 --> 00:49.076
That one community is stronger
than a thousand of its members.

00:49.077 --> 00:51.679
But how does a community
stay strong

00:51.680 --> 00:53.914
after losing its leader?

00:53.915 --> 00:57.518
And Carol was so much
more than just a mayor.

00:57.519 --> 01:00.471
She was...

01:00.472 --> 01:03.324
An open-minded friend...

01:04.643 --> 01:07.278
And a concerned mother,

01:07.279 --> 01:09.647
taken from us too soon

01:09.648 --> 01:12.951
by a terrible accident.

01:14.486 --> 01:16.537
Screw this.

01:16.538 --> 01:18.286
Tyler.

01:18.287 --> 01:20.291
Tyler.

01:23.829 --> 01:26.113
Please join me in observing

01:26.114 --> 01:28.213
a minute of silence
in her memory.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:45.985 --> 01:48.186
You ok?

01:48.187 --> 01:50.805
I'll be right back.

01:50.806 --> 01:54.125
Thank you very much.

01:54.126 --> 01:57.578
In the wake of this tragedy, the
town has selected an interim mayor.

01:57.579 --> 02:00.031
Many of you already know him.

02:00.032 --> 02:02.039
Please welcome Mr. Rudy Hopkins.

02:07.790 --> 02:10.714
Thank you, sheriff.

02:10.715 --> 02:14.312
Carol Lockwood put
this town first,

02:14.313 --> 02:16.848
and that's why I'm here
to talk to you guys.

02:16.849 --> 02:19.389
You folks...

02:35.367 --> 02:37.324
April?

02:38.871 --> 02:40.538
What's wrong?

02:40.539 --> 02:43.374
Nothing. I'm fine.

02:43.375 --> 02:45.248
But you're crying.

02:46.462 --> 02:48.046
It's just the whole
mayor thing.

02:48.047 --> 02:50.128
You know,
it's bringing up stuff with my dad.

02:51.917 --> 02:53.799
And I know you're
a vampire.

02:55.504 --> 02:57.719
Wait. What?

03:03.312 --> 03:04.979
Oh, was that
necessary?

03:04.980 --> 03:07.565
No, but it was fun.

03:08.351 --> 03:13.250

03:14.440 --> 03:16.056
Hey, you just missed

03:16.057 --> 03:17.658
the mandatory
all-school assembly.

03:17.659 --> 03:18.893
Well, that's because I'm

03:18.894 --> 03:21.299
at a mandatory all-alone
drinking party.

03:21.300 --> 03:22.933
Seriously?
You decided to go

03:22.934 --> 03:24.918
on a ripper
bender now?

03:24.919 --> 03:26.720
My brother slept with Elena.

03:26.721 --> 03:28.755
Kind of puts a little bit
of a damper on things.

03:28.756 --> 03:31.024
First of all,
you are not supposed to know that.

03:31.025 --> 03:34.928
Second of all, Tyler is already
spiraling, and he gets priority.

03:34.929 --> 03:37.397
His mother just died.
What do you expect?

03:37.398 --> 03:39.733
I'm his girlfriend.
I expect him to talk to me.

03:39.734 --> 03:41.935
But instead he's all angry,
and it doesn't help that

03:41.936 --> 03:43.937
everyone keeps referring to his
mother's death as an accident,

03:43.938 --> 03:47.574
which is really just a polite
way of saying that she was drunk.

03:47.575 --> 03:49.209
You think Klaus
killed her?

03:49.210 --> 03:52.245
Well, I don't think
she drowned in a Martini glass.

03:52.246 --> 03:56.449
Just get it together.
I can't do it alone.

04:10.181 --> 04:11.515
The assembly's over.

04:11.516 --> 04:13.350
What the hell's going on?

04:13.351 --> 04:14.796
The school will
be empty soon.

04:15.937 --> 04:18.688
How many times
did you compel me?

04:18.689 --> 04:21.274
Don't...
Just don't lie.

04:21.274 --> 04:23.160
Rebekah says
you lie.

04:23.161 --> 04:24.828
Rebekah's not who you
think she is, April.

04:25.389 --> 04:27.767
What, she's not a thousand-year-old
original vampire?

04:27.768 --> 04:30.951
Listen, we can
figure this out, ok,

04:30.952 --> 04:32.669
but we have
to get out of here.

04:34.154 --> 04:37.027
Sorry.
Not allowed.

04:39.510 --> 04:40.994
Why don't you
take a seat?

04:40.995 --> 04:42.879
The rest of the class
will be here shortly.

04:47.351 --> 04:48.835
First saved message.

04:48.836 --> 04:50.854
Hey, it's me.

04:50.855 --> 04:53.857
Look, I know
why you sent me away.

04:53.858 --> 04:56.843
You think that what I'm feeling for
you is because of the sire bond,

04:56.844 --> 05:00.280
but I hate not being
near you.

05:07.572 --> 05:10.123
Go ahead.
Make a move.

05:10.124 --> 05:13.146
I drove up here to be your wingman,
not kick your ass.

05:19.417 --> 05:20.487
Aah! Ok.

05:21.053 --> 05:22.869
I get it.
I get it.

05:22.870 --> 05:25.204
You're a badass.

05:29.477 --> 05:30.760
You see that?

05:30.761 --> 05:33.597
Couldn't miss it.
It was in slow motion.

05:33.598 --> 05:35.398
Then teach me
something useful.

05:35.399 --> 05:37.050
We've been here
for days, and so far

05:37.051 --> 05:38.755
all you've done
is bark orders.

05:42.823 --> 05:44.511
Ok.

05:45.928 --> 05:47.727
Take a seat at
the bench, quarterback.

05:47.728 --> 05:49.562
Karate kid wts
a anot at the title.

05:49.563 --> 05:52.102
Jeremy, you're
not ready for this.

05:54.568 --> 05:55.814
Well?

05:57.672 --> 06:01.945
Now, all I have to do is apply
a little pressure under your jaw.

06:05.763 --> 06:07.931
Really? Again?

06:10.584 --> 06:11.830
Ok.

06:13.387 --> 06:15.388
Double pepperoni
3 days in a row.

06:15.389 --> 06:17.307
You guys eat
anything else?

06:17.308 --> 06:19.129
Why?
Are you offering?

06:20.394 --> 06:21.978
A little something
extra, cut off

06:21.979 --> 06:23.697
the pizza pipeline
for a couple days.

06:23.698 --> 06:25.802
No matter how much they beg,
don't come back.

06:27.652 --> 06:29.152
Sorry, guys.

06:29.153 --> 06:30.453
You're gonna
starve us now?

06:30.454 --> 06:31.705
If that's what it takes

06:31.706 --> 06:32.939
to make you a hunter.

06:32.940 --> 06:35.992
Now run around
the lake, twice.

06:38.796 --> 06:40.580
Keep him company.

06:40.581 --> 06:42.465
I don't have
to listen to you.

06:42.466 --> 06:44.070
You do
if you want to eat.

06:52.426 --> 06:55.128
Being
near you, and I miss you, Damon.

06:55.129 --> 06:57.167
I wish you would just
let me come to you.

07:01.969 --> 07:03.403
What?

07:03.404 --> 07:04.854
Guess who.

07:04.855 --> 07:06.639
I'm back, dagger-free,

07:06.640 --> 07:07.974
and I'm holding Elena
hostage at the High School.

07:07.975 --> 07:09.359
Just thought you should know.

07:09.360 --> 07:10.610
Who the hell was
dumb enough

07:10.611 --> 07:11.811
to pull that dagger
out of you?

07:11.812 --> 07:13.830
I'll be asking
the questions today.

07:13.831 --> 07:15.332
See ya soon.

07:26.043 --> 07:28.044
I'm only ready to talk to you

07:28.045 --> 07:30.575
if you're ready
to rejoin civilization.

07:30.576 --> 07:34.517
How would you like to drive the white
oak stake through Rebekah's heart?

07:34.518 --> 07:39.606
If it means you're not drinking your
way through the mystic grill, sure.

07:39.607 --> 07:41.358
So...

07:41.359 --> 07:43.393
First speech
under your belt.

07:43.394 --> 07:45.895
Now for the fun part.

07:45.896 --> 07:48.531
Welcome to the world
of careful cover-ups.

07:48.532 --> 07:51.350
We've ruled Carol's death
as head trauma from a fall.

07:51.351 --> 07:53.236
That's the official
autopsy.

07:53.237 --> 07:55.688
She did not go
gently, did she?

07:55.689 --> 07:57.240
Any leads?

07:57.241 --> 07:58.908
We have ideas.

07:58.909 --> 08:00.076
Let me guess.

08:00.077 --> 08:01.878
Sharp teeth and bad
table manners?

08:01.879 --> 08:03.997
You sure you want this?

08:03.998 --> 08:06.666
I mean, 6 people were
offered this job before you.

08:06.667 --> 08:08.385
They all said no
for a reason.

08:08.386 --> 08:10.236
I'm saying yes
for a reason,

08:10.237 --> 08:12.889
and my reason
just walked in.

08:14.341 --> 08:16.760
I'll let you know what we find.
Thank you, sheriff.

08:16.761 --> 08:19.345
Hey, sheriff.
Hey, dad.

08:19.346 --> 08:21.898
- Hey.
- So...

08:21.899 --> 08:24.717
Far cry from being
a traveling pharmaceutical rep.

08:24.718 --> 08:27.737
I noticed a few of your friends
missing from the assembly.

08:27.738 --> 08:29.939
So much for mandatorat
I guess, huh?

08:29.940 --> 08:31.908
Dad, stop it.

08:31.909 --> 08:34.861
You can't come in here
and start making rules.

08:34.861 --> 08:37.363
I think this town could
use a few more rules.

08:37.364 --> 08:39.948
You're forgetting I can
help protect the town.

08:39.950 --> 08:43.787
I am well aware
of your gifts, Bonnie...

08:43.788 --> 08:45.939
But don't forget
I'm your father.

08:45.940 --> 08:48.758
That means that I get
to protect you.

09:36.507 --> 09:37.952
Hello, Stefan.

09:39.426 --> 09:42.095
I'm here.
What do you want?

09:42.096 --> 09:45.181
The same thing I wanted when
you helped make Klaus stab me.

09:45.182 --> 09:46.850
The cure.

09:49.904 --> 09:52.634
I hope you're not waiting for
Caroline to show up and stake me...

09:54.658 --> 09:56.971
Because I already
found her.

10:07.568 --> 10:08.818
Stefan.

10:08.819 --> 10:10.443
Did I say
you could move?

10:12.739 --> 10:14.707
Class is in session.

10:14.708 --> 10:17.076
You've all been compelled.
You know the rules.

10:17.077 --> 10:19.745
Answer my questions
honestly,

10:19.746 --> 10:21.581
no disobedience,

10:21.582 --> 10:22.865
no one leaves.

10:22.866 --> 10:24.867
April, my sweet,
take notes.

10:24.868 --> 10:26.793
This is how you get
answers in this town.

10:26.794 --> 10:29.138
Let's start with
a little quiz.

10:29.139 --> 10:32.708
In the year 1114, my brother
learned... thanks to yours truly...

10:32.709 --> 10:35.377
About a brotherhood of
vampire hunters with tattoos

10:35.378 --> 10:37.346
that grew with each kill.

10:37.347 --> 10:40.733
And these tattoos
reveal what? Elena?

10:40.734 --> 10:42.234
A map.

10:42.235 --> 10:45.154
Which led to,
Caroline?

10:45.155 --> 10:46.689
A cure for vampirism.

10:46.690 --> 10:48.724
Perfect.
We're all caught up.

10:48.725 --> 10:51.727
Stefan Salvatore, the last time
we saw each other,

10:51.728 --> 10:54.730
you had a vampire hunter,
but in order to decode the map,

10:54.731 --> 10:57.066
you needed the location
of the hunter's sword,

10:57.067 --> 11:01.454
which you got out of me
using some very dirty tricks.

11:01.455 --> 11:04.090
Assuming you found the sword,
you must have found the cure,

11:04.091 --> 11:06.542
and yet you're all
still vampires,

11:06.543 --> 11:08.260
which means something
went wrong.

11:08.261 --> 11:09.545
What are you doing?

11:09.546 --> 11:12.598
You asked me
to take notes.

11:12.599 --> 11:14.266
I wasn't being
literal, darling.

11:14.267 --> 11:16.302
But now that you mention it,
a flow chart would be nice,

11:16.303 --> 11:19.053
which means index cards
and push pins. Go fetch.

11:20.807 --> 11:22.475
You're wasting
your time.

11:22.476 --> 11:24.426
We don't know
anything.

11:24.427 --> 11:26.445
So you just gave up?

11:26.446 --> 11:29.148
I thought you'd do
anything to save Elena,

11:29.149 --> 11:31.784
even if it meant taking
the cure yourself

11:31.785 --> 11:33.693
so you could grow old
and die with her.

11:37.290 --> 11:39.616
Why do you look
so surprised?

11:44.998 --> 11:46.706
I'm missing something.
What is it?

11:48.835 --> 11:50.752
They broke up, ok?

11:52.556 --> 11:53.889
Now let us go.

11:53.890 --> 11:55.465
Broke up?

11:57.010 --> 11:58.811
Wait. I'm confused.

11:58.812 --> 12:02.430
I thought Elena was
your epic love, Stefan.

12:04.685 --> 12:06.736
I asked you what happened,

12:06.737 --> 12:08.738
and you have to tell me.

12:08.739 --> 12:10.980
She slept with Damon.

12:28.341 --> 12:29.666
Good.

12:30.994 --> 12:32.661
Now...

12:34.131 --> 12:36.966
Now do it like your life
depends on it 'cause it does.

12:36.967 --> 12:38.500
Don't act like you care
about my life.

12:38.501 --> 12:40.335
You care about the hunter's
mark and curing Elena

12:40.336 --> 12:42.304
so she's not sired
to your ass.

12:42.305 --> 12:44.673
Both require you
to be alive,

12:44.674 --> 12:49.344
which is why I've updated our relationship
status to "it's complicated."

12:51.648 --> 12:53.532
You talked
to her at all?

12:53.533 --> 12:55.184
Elena?

12:55.185 --> 12:56.902
Maybe.

12:56.903 --> 12:59.872
Why? Run out of
voicemails to listen to?

12:59.873 --> 13:02.992
I'm sorry.
Did I interrupt play time?

13:02.993 --> 13:04.160
What the hell are
you doing here?

13:04.161 --> 13:05.327
I'm simply
appreciating

13:05.328 --> 13:07.329
the sights and
smells of nature,

13:07.330 --> 13:09.165
neither of which
presently include

13:09.166 --> 13:10.549
rotting
vampire flesh,

13:10.550 --> 13:12.918
so I'm a bit
concerned.

13:12.919 --> 13:14.970
How many vampires
has he killed?

13:14.971 --> 13:18.374
If we throw Jeremy out into
the world right now, he's chum.

13:18.375 --> 13:20.760
Now, see,
that's not a number.

13:20.761 --> 13:22.762
12... that's
a number.

13:22.763 --> 13:24.013
That's how many
of my hybrids

13:24.014 --> 13:26.015
I slaughtered
with my sword.

13:26.016 --> 13:28.184
3... that's how many
days it took

13:28.185 --> 13:29.885
to quell the urge to
kill your brother, after

13:29.886 --> 13:32.905
he knowingly watched
as I walked into a death trap.

13:32.906 --> 13:34.240
One...

13:34.241 --> 13:37.243
That's the number of
purposes you serve.

13:37.244 --> 13:41.113
You are here to
grow Jeremy's mark,

13:41.114 --> 13:44.083
so I ask again...

13:44.084 --> 13:47.586
How many vampires has
he killed since he's been here?

13:47.587 --> 13:49.738
Zero.

13:49.739 --> 13:52.081
Hmm. That's a pity.

13:53.460 --> 13:55.427
I'm going to need
that cure

13:55.428 --> 13:57.746
sooner rather
than later,

13:57.747 --> 14:00.766
hybrid shortage
and all.

14:00.767 --> 14:02.935
How can I help?

14:02.936 --> 14:05.137
You know...

14:05.138 --> 14:08.107
Now that you mention it,

14:08.108 --> 14:10.309
Jeremy...
Watch and learn.

14:15.482 --> 14:17.774
That's for Carol Lockwood.

14:22.622 --> 14:26.325
So, vampire Elena is
a trollop who likes bad boys,

14:26.326 --> 14:28.443
which explains why Stefan
reeks of alcohol.

14:28.444 --> 14:33.632
But what it doesn't explain
is why sweet, loving,

14:33.633 --> 14:38.888
innocent Elena could be
so heartless towards Stefan.

14:42.676 --> 14:45.635
How could she hurt you
like that? Answer, please.

14:46.930 --> 14:48.364
She didn't know it
at the time,

14:48.365 --> 14:49.972
but she was sired to Damon.

14:52.903 --> 14:55.971
A sire bond. Fascinating.

14:56.436 --> 14:58.140
And what do you think
about that, Elena?

14:58.141 --> 15:01.493
I think you're sad
and bored

15:01.494 --> 15:04.146
and in desperate need
of a hobby.

15:04.147 --> 15:07.482
You're hiding something.
'Fess up.

15:07.483 --> 15:10.870
I didn't sleep with Damon
because of his sire bond.

15:10.871 --> 15:13.204
I slept with Damon because
I'm in love with him.

15:25.719 --> 15:28.553
What does any of this have
to do with the stupid cure?

15:30.223 --> 15:32.725
You're right.
We got off the point.

15:32.726 --> 15:35.694
Stefan, how do I
find the cure?

15:35.695 --> 15:39.031
Unless you'd rather talk
about Damon and Elena all day.

15:39.032 --> 15:41.317
There's a Professor.
He knows where the cure is.

15:41.318 --> 15:45.287
Thank you. And, uh,
where do I find this Professor?

15:45.288 --> 15:48.958
Oh, and so now I'm "gifted"?
He hates my witch heritage.

15:48.959 --> 15:50.859
That's why he travels all the time.
He can't handle it.

15:50.860 --> 15:53.579
And suddenly he wants to
be a protective father?

15:53.580 --> 15:55.547
No. Not like this.

15:55.548 --> 15:57.700
Come on. Distract me.

15:57.701 --> 15:59.668
Isn't there some...

15:59.669 --> 16:03.172
Magic therapy thing you
haven't shown me yet?

16:03.173 --> 16:04.924
Listen, Bonnie, I hate
to tell you this...

16:04.925 --> 16:06.508
Actually, you know what?
I take that back.

16:06.509 --> 16:08.877
I'm proud
to tell you this.

16:08.878 --> 16:10.312
You don't need
my help anymore.

16:10.313 --> 16:12.263
In fact...

16:17.237 --> 16:20.062
I was hoping to present this
with a cupcake or something.

16:23.660 --> 16:25.067
Happy graduation.

16:30.250 --> 16:31.417
It's beautiful.

16:31.418 --> 16:33.669
It's human bone.
Oh.

16:33.670 --> 16:35.921
Legend says it was worn

16:35.922 --> 16:38.257
by the 2,000-year-old
witch Qetsiyah,

16:38.258 --> 16:40.125
who drew on it...

16:40.126 --> 16:41.743
For strength.

16:41.744 --> 16:45.747
Bonnie, you have come
so far so fast.

16:45.748 --> 16:47.749
If you trust
my opinion,

16:47.750 --> 16:49.717
your magic is exactly
where it needs to be.

16:50.971 --> 16:52.938
Does this mean
I have to go home?

16:52.939 --> 16:55.806
It means I got a stack of papers
I got to grade by tomorrow.

16:55.807 --> 16:57.016
I can take a hint.

16:59.929 --> 17:01.646
Thanks, Shane.

17:16.713 --> 17:18.630
Oh, my God.

17:18.631 --> 17:20.115
Kol.

17:21.835 --> 17:23.584
Shane?

17:46.825 --> 17:48.525
I told you I don't
want to talk.

17:48.526 --> 17:50.844
I heard. You're
keeping all that rage

17:50.845 --> 17:52.830
bottled up inside.

17:52.831 --> 17:54.615
Caroline's worried
sick about you.

17:54.616 --> 17:55.833
Rebekah?

17:55.834 --> 17:57.418
Hello, Tyler.

17:57.419 --> 18:00.421
I heard my brother made
a real mess of your life.

18:00.422 --> 18:04.174
Believe me, I can relate.
You have my condolences.

18:04.175 --> 18:07.878
In fact, why don't you come down to the high
school so you can accept them in person?

18:07.879 --> 18:09.079
And why would I
do that?

18:09.080 --> 18:11.131
Because I have
your girlfriend.

18:11.132 --> 18:14.427
Maybe you have a better shot at
saving her than you did your mother.

18:21.860 --> 18:24.528
Sister...

18:24.529 --> 18:25.879
Look at this.

18:25.880 --> 18:27.881
You're even worse
than Klaus.

18:27.882 --> 18:29.683
Kol. Finally.

18:29.684 --> 18:31.485
Did you bring me
what I asked for?

18:37.659 --> 18:39.243
You must be Shane.

18:49.036 --> 18:51.388
If you're here
for payback, go for it.

18:51.389 --> 18:54.558
But you'll be stuck baby-sitting
the little hunter that could.

18:54.559 --> 18:56.877
You know...

18:56.878 --> 19:00.765
If you adjust your angle a little
bit, you'll find a sharper edge.

19:02.434 --> 19:05.602
I know how
to whittle. Thanks.

19:05.603 --> 19:07.571
Now I know why those
hybrids hated you.

19:07.572 --> 19:08.906
You are annoying.

19:08.907 --> 19:11.075
Actually,
I'm just perplexed

19:11.076 --> 19:13.761
as to why Jeremy hasn't
killed any vampires.

19:13.762 --> 19:15.312
Darwinism, Klaus.

19:15.313 --> 19:16.914
He needs to be able
to protect himself

19:16.915 --> 19:19.566
before we hunt down
his first vampire nest.

19:19.567 --> 19:21.752
And here was I, thinking
you were the fun brother.

19:21.753 --> 19:23.737
Well, let's play
a little game, shall we?

19:23.738 --> 19:25.706
Jeremy needs more victims,
and there's a whole town of people

19:25.707 --> 19:29.843
down the road just waiting to be
turned into vampires for the slaughter.

19:29.844 --> 19:31.879
You don't think that
occurred to me, Klaus?

19:31.880 --> 19:33.914
The tragedy is, Damon,

19:33.915 --> 19:36.767
it did occur to you,
yet you chose to ignore it.

19:36.768 --> 19:39.770
And my guess is you did it
to impress Elena.

19:39.771 --> 19:43.807
Somehow, to honor her, you'll
find a way to spare innocent lives

19:43.808 --> 19:46.268
and walk Jeremy down
the moral high road.

19:48.363 --> 19:51.482
That's why I've already made
the necessary corrections.

19:53.635 --> 19:55.528
What did you do?

20:01.826 --> 20:03.744
Don't tell me he ordered
another pizza.

20:03.745 --> 20:05.329
No, I'm just an idiot.

20:05.330 --> 20:07.714
I ran out of gas
and my phone's dead.

20:07.715 --> 20:09.550
Think I could use yours?
Yeah, come on in.

20:09.551 --> 20:11.502
I'll run upstairs
and grab my cell.

20:15.557 --> 20:17.925
What the hell?

20:17.926 --> 20:19.810
What are you doing here?

20:19.811 --> 20:21.395
Car drama.

20:21.396 --> 20:23.296
Your friend just went
to go get his phone.

20:23.297 --> 20:24.681
Well, I'm about
to go take a shower,

20:24.682 --> 20:26.892
but you're more than
welcome to wait inside.

20:34.025 --> 20:35.909
Thanks.

20:41.749 --> 20:43.149
Kol...

20:43.150 --> 20:45.485
And Rebekah Mikaelson,
two members of

20:45.486 --> 20:48.122
the original vampire family.
This is such a trip.

20:49.440 --> 20:51.291
Where's the cure?

20:51.292 --> 20:54.044
Compulsion won't work.

20:54.045 --> 20:56.630
It's a little trick
I picked up in Tibet.

20:56.631 --> 21:01.001
Right. Well, we'll just have to
do this the old-fashioned way.

21:01.002 --> 21:04.021
Beat him until he tells
you where to find it.

21:08.443 --> 21:11.061
Still glued
to your seats?

21:11.062 --> 21:13.189
Ooh, it's thick
with tension in here.

21:14.449 --> 21:16.483
Let's spice things
up a bit.

21:16.484 --> 21:18.869
Elena, truth or dare?

21:18.870 --> 21:21.021
We're done playing your
stupid games, Rebekah.

21:21.022 --> 21:23.123
Truth or dare,
Elena?

21:23.124 --> 21:25.142
You're compelled.
Answer.

21:25.143 --> 21:26.452
Dare.

21:27.745 --> 21:29.580
I dare you
to tell Stefan

21:29.581 --> 21:31.048
the truth
about Damon.

21:31.049 --> 21:32.458
Seriously?

21:38.056 --> 21:41.308
Being with Damon
makes me happy.

21:41.309 --> 21:43.560
Clowns make you happy,
Elena.

21:43.561 --> 21:45.178
Dig a little deeper.

21:45.179 --> 21:47.981
When I'm with him...

21:49.400 --> 21:53.437
It feels
unpredictable, like...

21:53.438 --> 21:55.397
Like I'm free.

21:57.659 --> 22:00.027
And how do you feel
when you're with Stefan?

22:00.028 --> 22:01.795
Stop.

22:01.796 --> 22:03.780
She can't.
She's compelled.

22:03.781 --> 22:07.618
Lately, I feel
like I'm a project,

22:07.619 --> 22:11.705
like I'm a problem
that needs to be fixed.

22:13.041 --> 22:15.442
I think I make him sad,

22:15.443 --> 22:17.544
and I can't be with
someone like that

22:17.545 --> 22:20.097
because...

22:20.098 --> 22:24.093
When he looks at me, all
he sees is a broken toy.

22:31.025 --> 22:32.977
Do you still love
Stefan?

22:34.729 --> 22:36.146
Yes.

22:38.116 --> 22:40.818
Are you still
in love with Stefan?

22:42.370 --> 22:43.529
No.

22:49.794 --> 22:52.129
Did that hurt,

22:52.130 --> 22:54.581
having someone you love drive
a dagger through your heart?

22:54.582 --> 22:55.882
Go to hell.

22:55.883 --> 22:59.253
Did... that... hurt?

23:04.142 --> 23:05.467
Yes.

23:08.896 --> 23:12.808
Welcome to the last
900 years of my life.

23:17.989 --> 23:21.491
Ah, good, you're here.
It was just getting depressing.

23:21.492 --> 23:22.993
What the hell is going on?

23:22.994 --> 23:25.362
Listen to the rules
carefully.

23:25.363 --> 23:28.481
Stay in the building.
No vamp-running in the hallways.

23:28.482 --> 23:30.200
Vamp-running
from what?

23:34.372 --> 23:36.173
- Turn.
- What?

23:36.174 --> 23:38.091
You can't.
He'll lose control.

23:38.092 --> 23:39.509
That's the whole point.

23:39.510 --> 23:41.128
I've exhausted all
your knowledge.

23:41.129 --> 23:43.380
Now I have the Professor
to help me find the cure,

23:43.381 --> 23:44.998
you're just competition.

23:44.999 --> 23:47.884
Whoever finds it first gets
to decide what to do with it:

23:47.885 --> 23:51.722
Use it, share it,
destroy it, save it...

23:51.723 --> 23:53.357
I want that to be me.

23:53.358 --> 23:55.142
But if I turn,
I'll kill them.

23:56.694 --> 23:58.312
Yes, you will.

24:00.148 --> 24:01.899
Turn.

24:21.883 --> 24:24.084
Did you find
your phone?

24:28.343 --> 24:29.673
Get off!

24:29.674 --> 24:30.719
Get off!

24:52.780 --> 24:58.779
Bonnie?

25:01.390 --> 25:03.390
Rebekah told me that
you're a witch.

25:03.391 --> 25:05.587
Rebekah? What the hell
is going on?

25:05.588 --> 25:08.211
Rebekah has Stefan, Elena,
and Caroline compelled.

25:08.212 --> 25:10.592
She's getting them to actually
tell the truth for a change.

25:11.066 --> 25:13.066
What?

25:13.067 --> 25:14.651
Shane can't be compelled.

25:14.652 --> 25:17.771
She'll have him torture him
to find out what he knows.

25:17.772 --> 25:20.207
What are you looking for?
I need salt.

25:20.208 --> 25:22.576
I think I just
saw some.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.784
What are you doing?

25:30.785 --> 25:32.402
If this pendant will
connect me to Shane,

25:32.403 --> 25:34.158
then I can do
a protection spell.

25:53.524 --> 25:55.692
Where is the cure?!

25:58.813 --> 26:00.030
Ohh!

26:00.031 --> 26:01.727
Where is the cure?

26:14.489 --> 26:16.880
You're human.
Why do you want it anyway?

26:16.881 --> 26:18.114
That's the beauty
of this.

26:18.115 --> 26:19.549
You can have it.
I just want Silas.

26:19.550 --> 26:22.135
No.

26:23.638 --> 26:25.788
What do you know
about Silas?

26:25.789 --> 26:27.757
He's the world's first
immortal being,

26:27.758 --> 26:30.393
who just happens to be
imprisoned with the cure.

26:30.394 --> 26:32.466
And I want to free him.

26:32.467 --> 26:33.800
No!

26:39.103 --> 26:40.603
April?

26:42.773 --> 26:44.240
What's happening?

26:52.616 --> 26:54.417
Stop!

27:02.626 --> 27:03.877
He's of no use dead.

27:03.878 --> 27:05.161
Did you not hear
what he said?

27:05.162 --> 27:06.625
Silas will kill us
all, sister.

27:07.049 --> 27:10.300
Silas does not exist.
He is a fairy tale

27:10.301 --> 27:12.852
made up to scare children
into eating their vegetables.

27:12.853 --> 27:14.883
Silas is very real.

27:16.857 --> 27:18.841
I know where he's buried,

27:18.842 --> 27:21.061
and soon I'll have
the spell that wakes him.

27:21.062 --> 27:22.896
Wait a second.
You're lying.

27:22.897 --> 27:24.731
You can't get to him
without his...

27:24.732 --> 27:25.852
Tombstone?

27:26.284 --> 27:28.818
Dozens to die in
a blood sacrifice?

27:28.819 --> 27:30.537
Believe me, I know.

27:30.538 --> 27:32.288
I've done it.

27:32.289 --> 27:35.525
Those massacres are
a pain to engineer.

27:35.526 --> 27:38.962
You're the one who got
the council blown up.

27:38.963 --> 27:41.748
It was
a noble sacrifice...

27:41.749 --> 27:44.584
And temporary

27:44.585 --> 27:47.053
because once
I raise Silas...

27:47.054 --> 27:49.472
Silas will raise the dead.

27:49.473 --> 27:53.176
He will bring back
every last soul...

27:53.177 --> 27:55.895
Who died on his behalf.

27:55.896 --> 27:57.313
No!

28:03.104 --> 28:05.100
April, oh, my God!

28:22.506 --> 28:24.624
Wait.
I can fight it.

28:42.693 --> 28:45.228
Aah! Get out of here!

28:45.229 --> 28:47.225
Go.

28:49.483 --> 28:52.702
That door's
not gonna hold him.

29:50.329 --> 29:51.987
You should be
thanking me.

29:51.988 --> 29:53.873
You killed my only chance
at finding the cure.

29:53.874 --> 29:56.408
Silas on the loose would
be hell on earth.

29:56.409 --> 29:59.194
And frankly, sister...

29:59.195 --> 30:01.747
I don't think you
could handle it.

30:01.748 --> 30:03.049
How did you
get that?

30:03.050 --> 30:04.967
Way too easily.

30:41.505 --> 30:43.455
Bonnie.

30:43.456 --> 30:46.091
Help! Someone help!

30:47.878 --> 30:49.011
Bonnie, what's going on?

30:49.012 --> 30:50.012
She needs help.

30:50.013 --> 30:51.514
What happened?

30:51.515 --> 30:53.215
I did a protection spell,
but it accidentally linked

30:53.216 --> 30:54.517
Shane to April.

30:54.518 --> 30:55.935
And you
couldn't control it?

30:55.936 --> 30:57.469
I didn't even know
I was doing it.

30:57.470 --> 30:59.104
Usually I feel pain or I
bleed, but this time I just

30:59.105 --> 31:01.359
felt more power.

31:04.027 --> 31:05.427
It's ok. It's ok.

31:05.905 --> 31:09.097
You're ok. You're ok.
You're ok. Ok.

31:09.659 --> 31:11.266
Bonnie, get her out of
the school.

31:11.267 --> 31:14.486
Just be careful.
Tyler is out there, and he turned.

31:14.487 --> 31:15.988
What about you?

31:15.989 --> 31:17.918
No, we can't leave.
Rebekah's compelled us.

31:17.919 --> 31:21.243
Just go.
We'll deal with her later.

31:28.635 --> 31:29.668
Stefan...

31:29.669 --> 31:30.722
No.

31:31.138 --> 31:33.308
Stefan, we have to
talk about this. Please.

31:33.309 --> 31:35.257
Talk about what,
huh?

31:35.258 --> 31:38.344
How many more ways are there
for you to rip my heart out?

31:38.345 --> 31:39.397
I'm sorry.

31:39.847 --> 31:41.630
Sorry that it happened,
or sorry that I found out?

31:41.631 --> 31:44.033
I'm sorry
about all of it.

31:44.034 --> 31:45.634
I'm really sorry, Stefan.

31:45.635 --> 31:50.072
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I didn't want that.

31:52.826 --> 31:56.623
Why are my least favorite
people always the most durable?

32:03.286 --> 32:05.754
Tyler...

32:26.364 --> 32:29.449
I'm so sorry.

32:29.450 --> 32:32.035
It wasn't your fault.

32:34.038 --> 32:37.240
Yes, it was.

32:37.241 --> 32:39.793
This whole thing.

32:39.794 --> 32:42.128
It's all my fault.

32:43.581 --> 32:46.449
No, Tyler.

32:46.450 --> 32:48.885
I should have
saved her.

32:58.979 --> 33:00.180
Leave her out of this.

33:00.181 --> 33:01.815
This is between
me and you.

33:01.816 --> 33:04.768
You're still
protecting her?

33:04.769 --> 33:07.984
Must I rip your bleeding
heart from your chest

33:07.985 --> 33:11.324
and show you the scar tissue
that is Elena Gilbert?

33:14.301 --> 33:15.467
There's
a solution

33:15.468 --> 33:17.269
to all your
problems, you know.

33:17.270 --> 33:18.872
I could compel him...

33:19.357 --> 33:24.002
Erase every memory
he has of you.

33:24.003 --> 33:25.754
Every day you've
spent together,

33:25.755 --> 33:31.051
every kiss, every lie,
every ounce of pain.

33:31.052 --> 33:36.038
I can take away every bit
of love he has for you,

33:36.039 --> 33:37.990
give you both
a clean slate.

33:37.991 --> 33:40.442
Just say the word,
and I'll make you

33:40.443 --> 33:44.046
and all that misery you've
caused him disappear.

33:44.047 --> 33:45.046
Do it.

33:47.751 --> 33:50.219
Excuse me?

33:50.220 --> 33:52.405
Erase it all.
Every memory.

33:52.406 --> 33:53.806
Stefan, no.

33:53.807 --> 33:56.091
I said do it.

34:04.235 --> 34:08.971
No. That would be
far too easy.

34:08.972 --> 34:11.806
I refuse to make
you forget her

34:11.808 --> 34:14.693
the way Klaus made you
forget me.

34:17.246 --> 34:19.949
But at least you know
how he really feels.

34:24.371 --> 34:29.592
Consider your eternity of
pain my revenge, Stefan.

34:29.592 --> 34:31.010
I've used you for
all you're worth.

34:31.011 --> 34:34.129
So now you're free to go.

34:50.397 --> 34:52.731
Stefan, wait.

35:20.686 --> 35:21.801
Turns out I miscalculated.

35:21.802 --> 35:24.002
Kol's gonna be a problem.

35:24.973 --> 35:27.891
I almost killed someone,

35:27.892 --> 35:29.059
and that's what
you miscalculated?

35:29.060 --> 35:31.127
April could've
died today.

35:31.128 --> 35:33.662
That's only because you didn't
know the extent of your abilities.

35:33.663 --> 35:35.131
My father just
became mayor.

35:35.132 --> 35:37.788
I can't be out
doing black magic.

35:37.789 --> 35:40.070
That's not what
expression is.

35:42.740 --> 35:44.174
Then what is it?

35:44.175 --> 35:45.475
It's a way of doing magic

35:45.476 --> 35:46.910
that isn't monitored by
nature or the spirits.

35:46.911 --> 35:48.480
It isn't good nor bad.

35:49.080 --> 35:52.248
But it also has
no limits,

35:52.249 --> 35:54.317
so how you use it is
up to you.

35:54.318 --> 35:57.704
That's what
I'm here for...

35:57.705 --> 36:00.540
To help you.

36:00.541 --> 36:04.662
Bonnie, listen to me.
You are the key to everything.

36:06.881 --> 36:10.100
I'm not going to let
anything bad happen to you.

36:27.568 --> 36:29.686
Hope your day is going
better than mine.

36:29.687 --> 36:32.372
Got to say,
I'm liking the odds.

36:32.373 --> 36:34.692
Stefan knows about us.

36:35.493 --> 36:38.461
Ooh.

36:38.462 --> 36:39.906
How'd he take it?

36:40.415 --> 36:42.158
How do you think?

36:43.701 --> 36:45.635
I'm thinking,
for the first time all week,

36:45.636 --> 36:49.723
I'm happy to be
at camp nowhere.

36:49.724 --> 36:50.834
How's Jeremy?

36:50.835 --> 36:54.177
That depends on
how much you trust me.

36:54.178 --> 36:56.879
You know that I trust you.

36:56.880 --> 37:01.251
Then I think he's gonna get
through this thing just fine.

37:01.252 --> 37:03.603
Thanks for looking
out for him.

37:03.604 --> 37:05.388
Yeah, well,
I told them if they were good,

37:05.389 --> 37:10.160
I'd buy them both ice cream,
so I got to go.

37:10.161 --> 37:11.855
Not yet.

37:13.347 --> 37:16.282
Something happened today.

37:16.283 --> 37:21.371
I realized something
about you, about us.

37:21.372 --> 37:23.790
And you can say
that it's the sire bond,

37:23.791 --> 37:26.376
and you know what?
Maybe... maybe it is,

37:26.377 --> 37:30.580
but I'm telling you
it's the most real thing

37:36.470 --> 37:39.215
I love you, Damon.

37:45.896 --> 37:49.365
I love you.

37:49.366 --> 37:52.452
Look.

37:52.453 --> 37:54.856
I'm going to get
this cure for you.

37:58.108 --> 38:01.494
And I'm gonna have to
do things you don't like.

38:01.495 --> 38:02.662
Damon...

38:02.663 --> 38:04.824
But listen carefully.

38:06.167 --> 38:11.387
Get in your car
right now.

38:11.388 --> 38:13.124
Come to me.

38:15.142 --> 38:17.060
I'll be there soon.

38:32.409 --> 38:33.770
You let yourself in.

38:33.771 --> 38:35.328
You called me.

38:35.329 --> 38:38.648
Should I be checking
for hidden daggers?

38:38.649 --> 38:40.010
Do you still want
to find the cure?

38:40.401 --> 38:42.035
More than anything.

38:42.036 --> 38:43.803
I want to ram it down
Niklaus' throat

38:43.804 --> 38:47.590
and look into his eyes
as he realizes he's mortal again.

38:47.991 --> 38:50.260
But Shane's dead
and you are useless,

38:50.261 --> 38:52.962
so I'm right back
where I started.

38:52.963 --> 38:55.500
Shane's not dead.

38:55.501 --> 38:58.184
But I watched
Kol impale him.

38:58.185 --> 39:00.687
Well, you probably shouldn't
have left him alone.

39:00.688 --> 39:02.522
Bonnie did a little spell.

39:02.523 --> 39:04.357
He's perfectly fine.

39:07.511 --> 39:09.612
You didn't have
to tell me that.

39:09.613 --> 39:12.315
Why am I really
here?

39:12.316 --> 39:14.167
You were right.

39:14.168 --> 39:15.785
I'm gonna be here
for an eternity,

39:15.786 --> 39:18.037
and I will go insane
if I don't know

39:18.038 --> 39:20.733
how Elena truly feels
about my brother.

39:23.794 --> 39:26.212
If you really
want the cure,

39:26.213 --> 39:27.630
you should know that
Shane has an agenda,

39:27.631 --> 39:29.699
and it's a dark one.

39:29.700 --> 39:32.585
He said he organized dozens
of people to die in sacrifice.

39:32.586 --> 39:35.588
He admitted to the council
explosion where 12 people died,

39:35.589 --> 39:37.206
and I'm guessing
it's not a coincidence

39:37.207 --> 39:40.844
that 12 hybrids died at
the hand of my brother.

39:40.845 --> 39:43.897
12...

39:43.898 --> 39:45.815
Channeling the energy
from a mass death is used

39:45.816 --> 39:48.985
in witchcraft to
perform dark spells.

39:48.986 --> 39:51.487
It's called expression.

39:51.488 --> 39:54.100
Shane admitted
all this to you?

39:54.101 --> 39:55.859
Proudly.

39:55.860 --> 39:57.460
Well, then I guess we'll have
to figure out how to manage him

39:57.461 --> 39:59.605
while we find the cure
for ourselves.

40:01.455 --> 40:03.355
"We"?

40:03.356 --> 40:05.194
There's no "we,"
Stefan.

40:05.195 --> 40:08.911
Listen, I hate my brother,
and you hate yours.

40:08.912 --> 40:11.497
But Damon's got Jeremy,
and Klaus has the sword,

40:11.498 --> 40:12.915
and Shane has Bonnie.

40:12.916 --> 40:14.954
You and I are the only ones
left with nothing.

40:14.955 --> 40:16.873
You said it yourself,
right?

40:16.874 --> 40:18.387
Whoever finds
the cure first

40:18.388 --> 40:20.923
gets to decide
what to do with it.

40:20.924 --> 40:25.394
What do you say?
You want to be partners?

40:27.047 --> 40:30.216
My father had no reason
to kill 11 people.

40:30.217 --> 40:32.768
He had no reason
to kill himself.

40:32.769 --> 40:34.820
He loved me.

40:34.821 --> 40:38.908
He loved Mystic Falls.

40:38.909 --> 40:41.827
He was brainwashed into
sparking that fire.

40:41.828 --> 40:44.163
Professor Shane
organized his death

40:44.164 --> 40:46.069
and the 11 others
who died with him.

40:49.655 --> 40:53.456
It's time this entire town
started telling the truth.

41:13.199 --> 41:14.332
I was beginning to worry

41:14.333 --> 41:16.140
you boys wouldn't find
the place.

41:16.141 --> 41:18.753
What the hell...?

41:18.754 --> 41:20.789
Did you kill all
these people?

41:20.790 --> 41:23.041
Not exactly.

41:23.042 --> 41:26.234
They're
in transition.

41:26.235 --> 41:28.778
Killing them is your job.

41:32.435 --> 41:33.718
You said you were
going to convince Klaus

41:33.719 --> 41:35.326
to do this
another way.

41:39.108 --> 41:40.608
I thought about it.

41:40.609 --> 41:45.169
And then I realized
his idea was better.
