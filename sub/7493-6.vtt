WEBVTT

00:05.417 --> 00:07.250
You can do this, Milton. Push it!

00:11.917 --> 00:12.834
That's...

00:14.583 --> 00:15.625
Two!

00:18.000 --> 00:20.291
- Thanks for sharing, Tina.
- You're welcome.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
Ah!

00:22.417 --> 00:23.667
Are you done, playing?

00:23.750 --> 00:25.625
I've been waiting to use that bench
for like an hour.

00:25.709 --> 00:27.000
I don't know what's more depressing.

00:27.083 --> 00:29.333
Watching you lift weights
or watching Jerry read.

00:32.166 --> 00:33.083
That's...

00:34.166 --> 00:36.041
Two.

00:36.750 --> 00:37.583
Whoo!

00:38.041 --> 00:39.834
- Thanks for sharing, Tina.
- You're welcome.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.625
Hey, anyone want to guess how I made $100
in 15 minutes going "he-yup"?

00:47.709 --> 00:48.917
He-nope!

00:50.709 --> 00:52.041
100 bucks? I'm listening.

00:52.583 --> 00:55.625
I bid on one of those abandoned
storage units at an auction,

00:55.709 --> 00:58.625
sold everything, and doubled my money.

00:59.250 --> 01:03.458
But, I held onto this classy treasure.

01:04.875 --> 01:06.333
What's the big deal? It's just a donkey.

01:06.625 --> 01:09.375
A jelly bean pooping donkey.

01:13.375 --> 01:14.291
Jackpot!

01:16.500 --> 01:18.500
That may be the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen.

01:21.959 --> 01:22.917
What're you doing?

01:23.000 --> 01:25.792
Clearing your stuff out of my locker.

01:26.166 --> 01:29.125
Hair care products, zit cream,

01:29.208 --> 01:30.583
picture of Kim...

01:30.667 --> 01:32.166
with a well-worn lip area.

01:32.250 --> 01:33.291
Give me that!

01:34.375 --> 01:35.917
Why don't you go find your own locker?

01:36.000 --> 01:38.875
No way! This is the biggest one in
the dojo, and I was here first.

01:38.959 --> 01:40.458
Holy Christmas nuts!

01:40.542 --> 01:42.959
Jack stole my locker. Gah!

01:43.667 --> 01:47.291
Oh, you probably shouldn't have done that.

01:47.375 --> 01:49.250
You know what? That is it!
I am so done with you!

01:49.375 --> 01:50.500
- I'm done with you!
- Oh!

01:50.583 --> 01:51.583
All right! All right!

01:51.667 --> 01:52.750
That is enough! Get up!

01:53.500 --> 01:54.333
Look,

01:54.417 --> 01:57.542
you two have been
at each other's throats for weeks.

01:58.500 --> 02:00.250
I know exactly what you two need.

02:00.542 --> 02:03.083
- Me too. Time apart.
- Fine with me.

02:03.583 --> 02:06.208
Actually, I was thinking of something
a little different.

02:06.667 --> 02:07.959
Road trip!

02:09.375 --> 02:10.500
Yup.

02:10.583 --> 02:11.792
Nothing brings friends together

02:11.875 --> 02:15.166
like 16 hours crammed inside
the back of an old RV.

02:16.291 --> 02:17.792
- This is all your fault.
- My fault?

02:17.875 --> 02:19.417
- How's it my fault?
- You tried to steal...

02:19.500 --> 02:20.375
Forgot the parking brake.

02:20.458 --> 02:22.250
- Mine! Mine!
- My locker first!

02:22.291 --> 02:24.417

It has been eight hours.

03:20.208 --> 03:21.583
I can't take anymore singing.

03:22.834 --> 03:24.417
You know what you two need?

03:24.500 --> 03:25.834
A little fresh country air.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.875
Uh... Oh, yeah.

03:32.917 --> 03:34.500
Nothing like that fresh country air.

03:40.792 --> 03:43.709
Just four more hours and we're gonna be
camping on the edge of the gorge.

03:44.250 --> 03:45.291
Four hours?

03:45.375 --> 03:47.709
Rudy, I'm getting hungry. And look,
there's a Waffle Hut up ahead.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.500
They only serve breakfast.

03:49.583 --> 03:51.458
I don't do breakfast for dinner.

03:51.542 --> 03:52.542
Here we go!

03:52.625 --> 03:55.333
My digestive system plays
by the rules, Jack.

03:55.417 --> 03:58.250
Unlike you and your renegade bowels!

03:59.583 --> 04:01.083
Okay, Milton, you pick a spot.

04:01.542 --> 04:03.333
What about the Garden Patch up in Pahrump?

04:03.417 --> 04:05.583
I've heard really good things
about their pickled jicama.

04:05.667 --> 04:07.417
Uh, I don't eat pickled jicama.

04:07.500 --> 04:09.250
You know why? Because I'm a dude!

04:09.750 --> 04:12.250
Oh, really? Tell that to your hair!

04:12.375 --> 04:15.834
- What? You're just jealous!
- Yeah, you look like a girl!

04:15.917 --> 04:19.375
So help me, if you keep this up,
I will turn this RV around!

04:19.959 --> 04:21.458
- Good!
- Do it!

04:21.917 --> 04:24.291
Oh! Oh, yeah.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

04:24.542 --> 04:26.500
Well, I am not turning this RV around

04:26.583 --> 04:28.041
and we are going to have fun!

If we pool our money, we'll have enough
to make a winning bid

04:55.625 --> 04:57.208
on storage locker 258.

04:58.417 --> 04:59.834
Why do we want 258?

04:59.917 --> 05:02.583
Oh, unit 258...

05:02.667 --> 05:06.500
was owned by a sports memorabilia fanatic.

05:06.667 --> 05:08.917
Now bidding on locker 258.

05:09.583 --> 05:11.208
Let's start the bid at $50.

05:11.291 --> 05:13.333
- Do I hear 50?
- He-yup!

05:13.417 --> 05:15.333
50, I got. Do I hear 75?

05:17.917 --> 05:20.000
75, I got. Do I hear 100?

05:20.083 --> 05:21.917
Cripes, someone's bidding
against me. What?

05:23.166 --> 05:24.709
Oh, just hang tough, Joan. You'll get it.

05:25.208 --> 05:26.333
Mama's going to 100.

05:26.417 --> 05:27.709
100, I got. Do I have 150?

05:29.291 --> 05:31.208
150, I got. Do I hear 200.

05:31.834 --> 05:34.166
- He-yup!
- That's 250 to you, sir.

05:34.291 --> 05:35.291
- Who, sir?
- You, sir.

05:35.375 --> 05:36.250
- Me, sir?
- Yes, sir.

05:36.333 --> 05:37.792
- No, sir!
- Aah!

05:38.750 --> 05:43.041
Going once, going twice, sold to the
woman wrestling the boy to the ground.

05:48.291 --> 05:50.417
Would have been nice to have stopped
at the supermarket...

05:50.667 --> 05:51.792
since we didn't have lunch.

05:51.875 --> 05:54.709
When you're out camping,
nature is your supermarket.

05:55.583 --> 05:57.667
Does anyone want another
helping of gravel stew?

05:59.875 --> 06:03.041
I'm good. Still trying to
digest my pinecone calzone.

06:04.583 --> 06:06.291
Rudy, come on. Can we just go home?

06:06.375 --> 06:07.375
Let's go home.

06:07.458 --> 06:08.625
I can't wait to be away from you.

06:08.709 --> 06:10.208
- Oh, seriously?
- Yeah, you drive me nuts!

06:10.291 --> 06:11.750
- Nag! That's all you do!
- Enough!

06:12.125 --> 06:13.458
I've had it with you two.

06:13.750 --> 06:16.208
I am going to go into the RV
and get a good night's sleep.

06:16.333 --> 06:17.542
You two can stay out here.

06:21.875 --> 06:23.959
Tomorrow morning we are going home.

06:34.792 --> 06:37.291
- You happy?
- Yeah, I kinda am.

06:39.417 --> 06:40.709
It's kind of rocky out here.

06:40.917 --> 06:42.375
It's called camping out, Jack.

06:42.458 --> 06:44.625
Why don't you just man
up and rough it like me?

06:53.667 --> 06:54.834
What is that?

06:54.917 --> 06:58.500
It's the latest in camping comfort.
The "Nature Napper 5000."

06:58.583 --> 07:00.125
It's made of a space-age polymer.

07:00.208 --> 07:02.291
The salesman said
it's 100 percent indestructible.

07:02.375 --> 07:04.208
<i>-</i>

07:07.041 --> 07:08.875

07:16.083 --> 07:17.125
Okay, Joan.

07:17.208 --> 07:20.667
When this locker makes us rich, let's
never lose sight of where we came from.

07:20.750 --> 07:22.750
I hear that, brother. Don't worry.

07:23.125 --> 07:25.375
I'll always just be Joan-y from the block.

07:34.291 --> 07:35.166
Okay.

07:35.875 --> 07:37.000
Here we go.

07:39.917 --> 07:40.875
Nothing!

07:44.041 --> 07:45.083
Nothing!

07:47.083 --> 07:48.041
Oh, ah ah ah!

07:48.125 --> 07:49.375
There's something in this one.

07:51.250 --> 07:53.041
Aww, it's just another box.

07:53.583 --> 07:55.709
What kind of sicko puts a box in a box?

07:56.917 --> 07:58.000
Look, Jerry.

07:58.083 --> 08:01.125
This box says, "Property
of the New York Yankees."

08:09.709 --> 08:13.500
Is that what I think it is?

08:17.208 --> 08:18.333
Yep.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.375
And look whose name's on it.

08:25.125 --> 08:27.041
Babe Ruth!

08:27.458 --> 08:30.500
Babe Ruth! Babe Ruth! Babe Ruth!

08:30.583 --> 08:32.208
- Babe...
- Who's babe Ruth?

08:33.959 --> 08:35.083
Oh, my!

08:35.500 --> 08:37.750
This is 100 percent authentic.

08:37.959 --> 08:40.166
You don't see this kind
of craftsmanship today.

08:44.917 --> 08:46.250
It's so beautiful.

08:47.792 --> 08:48.917
Hear that, Joan?

08:49.000 --> 08:51.709
We're the proud owners
of babe Ruth's jockstrap.

08:52.250 --> 08:54.500
It's not just any jock.
It's his lucky jock.

08:55.375 --> 08:57.166
Lucky jock? Really?

08:57.458 --> 08:59.375
He went from a chunky vacuum salesman

08:59.458 --> 09:01.542
to a baseball legend the day he slipped on

09:01.625 --> 09:04.041
that glorious guardian
of the nether regions.

09:06.458 --> 09:10.625
Hmm, so how many hundies for the undies?

09:12.000 --> 09:13.625
My jock museum...

09:14.083 --> 09:15.917
will pay $50,000 for it.

09:16.625 --> 09:18.291
I'll be back tomorrow with the money.

09:22.291 --> 09:23.291
Fifty...

09:24.208 --> 09:25.834
$50,000?

09:27.250 --> 09:28.333
Jerry?

09:28.792 --> 09:29.875
Don't worry.

09:30.583 --> 09:31.792
I got you, Joan.

09:46.959 --> 09:48.458
You have got to stop doing that!

09:48.542 --> 09:50.625
You kept me up all night.

09:50.709 --> 09:52.166
You think I like this?

09:52.625 --> 09:54.917
Do you know how many kids
suffer in silence

09:55.000 --> 09:57.250
from the heartbreak of honking rhinitosis?

09:58.000 --> 10:00.250
There is nothing silent about it.

10:02.166 --> 10:05.917
Well, maybe the great outdoors isn't
big enough for the two of us.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.625
Come on, Rudy! Let's go home!

10:08.709 --> 10:10.417
Yeah, Rudy, it's time to get out of here!

10:12.208 --> 10:14.291
I can't believe I was ever
friends with someone like you.

10:14.375 --> 10:16.542
You're nothing more
than a troglodyte.

10:19.291 --> 10:21.333
Oh, no, no. Rudy!

10:21.417 --> 10:22.417
No, Rudy!

10:22.500 --> 10:23.583
No, no, no.

10:36.917 --> 10:39.000
<i>There must be some real food
around here somewhere.</i>

10:42.417 --> 10:43.417
Nothing.

10:44.125 --> 10:45.250
Nothing.

10:46.709 --> 10:47.834
Skunk butt.

10:49.291 --> 10:50.417
Nothing.

10:51.792 --> 10:53.041
Skunk butt?

10:59.959 --> 11:02.125
-
- Rudy, don't move.

11:02.709 --> 11:04.458
I got skunk in the mouth.

11:06.250 --> 11:08.458
Rudy, you have a bigger
problem than skunk mouth.

11:08.917 --> 11:11.208
Oh, nothing can be worse than... aah!

11:12.875 --> 11:14.709
It's worse. It's so much worse!

11:20.458 --> 11:24.542
That guy from the jock museum was right
about the babe's jock being lucky.

11:24.959 --> 11:29.667
When he forks over that $50,000,
it'll be our lucky day.

11:33.083 --> 11:36.000
Lucky jock.

11:54.542 --> 11:55.542
Hello?

11:56.917 --> 11:58.166
Jeanie.

12:00.417 --> 12:03.000
Oh no, yeah, I'd love to come to
your party with all your sisters.

12:05.375 --> 12:08.542
No, it wouldn't be weird at all
that I'm the only guy there.

12:13.375 --> 12:14.458
The legend is true.

12:39.750 --> 12:41.125
There you are, you little thief.

12:41.208 --> 12:42.750
What kind of jerk jacks a jock?

12:43.583 --> 12:44.792
Joan, Joan, Joan.

12:44.875 --> 12:46.792
Look, the legend is true.
This thing is really lucky.

12:46.875 --> 12:50.458
Oh, please, I'm putting it back
in its case where it belongs.

12:56.709 --> 12:57.709
Hello.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.500
Oh, hi, Donnie.

13:00.667 --> 13:04.375
Yeah, I'd love to have dinner
at the fire house with all the firemen.

13:05.917 --> 13:09.166
No, it wouldn't be weird at
all that I'm the only girl!

13:46.917 --> 13:49.667
I called the park rangers, but they
can't get here for another half-hour.

13:49.750 --> 13:53.083
Forget that. I'm going to slowly
walk to the back of the RV.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.625
-
- Okay! Not walking! Not walking!

13:58.041 --> 13:59.417
It's too unstable, we can't wait.

14:01.500 --> 14:02.500
I got an idea.

14:02.583 --> 14:04.291
I'll run five Miles down
to the interstate,

14:04.417 --> 14:06.291
flag down an 18-Wheeler.
He'll back up here.

14:06.417 --> 14:08.667
We hook it up to the RV.
We pull Rudy to safety.

14:08.959 --> 14:11.291
That's my Jack, always
there when I need you.

14:12.959 --> 14:14.750
By the time you get back,
Rudy'll be splattered

14:14.834 --> 14:16.083
all over the bottom of the canyon.

14:16.166 --> 14:17.875
Worst plan ever, Jack!

14:17.959 --> 14:19.166
Never there when I need you!

14:20.083 --> 14:22.542
With all that stuff you packed,
why didn't you bother to pack a rope

14:22.625 --> 14:24.083
instead of the stupid "Nature Napper"?

14:26.041 --> 14:27.917
Well, that's it. The Nature Napper!

14:28.000 --> 14:31.208
What are we gonna do? Patch it, inflate
it, put it an the bottom of the canyon

14:31.291 --> 14:33.792
so Rudy has something
nice and soft to land on?

14:34.583 --> 14:36.375
Finally, a plan that'll work!

14:37.375 --> 14:39.917
No, the Nature Napper is made
from really strong rubber.

14:40.250 --> 14:42.125
We can cut it into strips
and make a rope out of it.

14:42.625 --> 14:45.917
Is that the same rubber that Jack
popped when he poked it with his stick?

14:46.291 --> 14:47.792
Fine, Rudy. What's your idea?

14:48.083 --> 14:48.959
Oh, I don't know.

14:49.041 --> 14:50.583
Maybe let's just take a minute.

14:50.667 --> 14:53.208
We'll use our heads
and come up with a better plan.

14:53.291 --> 14:55.250
-
- W... We're going Nature Napper!

14:55.583 --> 14:57.000
All right, let's go!

15:07.166 --> 15:08.291
Where have you been, Joan?

15:08.959 --> 15:09.875
Nowhere.

15:10.375 --> 15:11.834
Don't lie to me, sister.

15:12.750 --> 15:13.959
We both know you've been out there

15:14.041 --> 15:16.458
living la vida lucky
with a dead man's jock.

15:17.291 --> 15:19.750
So what if I was? It's half mine!

15:19.834 --> 15:21.125
And it's half mine.

15:21.208 --> 15:23.125
And I've decided I don't want to sell it.

15:23.208 --> 15:25.709
Well, I don't want to sell it either.
That thing changed my life!

15:26.583 --> 15:29.041
Oh, good. Well, then we'll keep it.

15:29.500 --> 15:31.750
Now ,if you hand it over, I need it
for a science test tomorrow

15:31.834 --> 15:33.625
that I plan to not study for.

15:35.041 --> 15:38.000
But I entered myself in
a beauty pageant tomorrow

15:38.083 --> 15:41.583
where I shall be named the most beautiful
teenage girl in all of Seaford.

15:42.542 --> 15:46.458
What? That kind of miracle would squeeze
every last drop of luck out of it.

15:48.083 --> 15:52.291
<i>Please! You said you were gonna
use it to pass a science test.</i>

15:54.166 --> 15:55.125
Give me that.

15:55.208 --> 15:56.333
Oh, give me that.

15:56.417 --> 15:58.333
Oh, I'm Jerry. I really want the jock.

15:58.417 --> 16:00.291
- Don't...
-

16:10.834 --> 16:12.000
Excuse me.

16:13.625 --> 16:14.709
Hello.

16:15.959 --> 16:17.458
I'm here with your money.

16:18.834 --> 16:21.083
Uh, Babe's jock, where is it?

16:21.750 --> 16:22.875
Uh...

16:32.333 --> 16:34.709
It was great doing business with you.
Thank you so much.

16:35.542 --> 16:37.041
Oh, no, no, no.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.375
Deal's off!

16:41.959 --> 16:43.208
You've ruined it!

16:46.458 --> 16:47.625
I can't believe it.

16:48.041 --> 16:49.750
We don't have the money.
We don't have the jock.

16:49.834 --> 16:50.750
We don't have anything.

16:51.208 --> 16:52.375
Oh, no.

16:53.208 --> 16:54.291
You're wrong, Jerry.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
We have something that they
can never take away from us.

16:59.250 --> 17:00.125
Our friendship?

17:00.750 --> 17:01.792
Forget that.

17:01.875 --> 17:03.250
My jelly bean pooping donkey.

17:09.291 --> 17:10.583
-
- Uh, Joan,

17:10.667 --> 17:11.709
that doesn't sound too good.

17:14.875 --> 17:16.458
Oh, get down. That thing's gonna blow!

17:30.458 --> 17:31.875
Hang on, Rudy. We're almost there.

17:33.208 --> 17:35.625
All right, Jack, I'm lowering
you down nice and easy.

17:35.709 --> 17:37.041
Just let me know when you're there.

17:41.250 --> 17:42.125
I'm there.

17:45.500 --> 17:46.625
Whoa!

17:58.375 --> 17:59.458
Whoa!

18:03.709 --> 18:04.583
All right.

18:05.625 --> 18:07.375
Rudy, give me your hand.

18:14.750 --> 18:15.834
I can't reach, Jack.

18:15.917 --> 18:17.250
Rudy, you're gonna have to jump.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.208
I can't do it, Jack. I'm scared.

18:20.709 --> 18:22.291
Rudy, it's Jack.

18:22.792 --> 18:24.709
If there's anybody
you should trust, it's him.

18:25.166 --> 18:27.500
Easy for you to say,
Mr. Not-hanging-over-a-gorge.

18:29.208 --> 18:31.250
-
- Rudy, it's going! Jump!

18:43.500 --> 18:46.417
Oh, great, there goes that deposit.

18:47.125 --> 18:49.000
-
- What was that?

18:49.875 --> 18:51.291
The branch... It's breaking!

18:54.000 --> 18:55.166
Oh! No!

18:57.750 --> 18:58.834
Rudy!

19:00.625 --> 19:01.625
Jack!

19:03.417 --> 19:04.417
Why?

19:04.834 --> 19:07.917
My best friend
and incompetent sensei are gone.

19:10.166 --> 19:12.041
No, we're not gone. We're here.

19:13.375 --> 19:14.208
I know,

19:14.709 --> 19:16.166
but you're angels now.

19:17.375 --> 19:19.250
Oh, Jack. Why, Jack?

19:19.542 --> 19:23.083
You were so brave, loyal and trustworthy,

19:23.959 --> 19:26.125
like a golden retriever with better hair.

19:27.291 --> 19:28.375
Milton.

19:30.875 --> 19:31.792
Jack!

19:31.875 --> 19:32.875
You're alive!

19:33.625 --> 19:35.375
Hello, I'm here too.

19:36.542 --> 19:37.875
Oh, Rudy!

19:38.834 --> 19:40.041
Look, Jack's alive!

19:40.125 --> 19:40.959
Hey! Oh.

19:43.083 --> 19:44.083
How'd you make it?

19:44.375 --> 19:47.917
Well, <i>we</i> made it when the rope slammed us
into the side of the canyon

19:48.000 --> 19:49.750
and we grabbed some roots
and climbed our way out.

19:50.375 --> 19:52.500
Those are some pretty nice things
you said about me, Milton.

19:52.583 --> 19:54.834
Well, when I thought I had lost you, I...

19:55.417 --> 19:58.291
felt like I had a hole in my heart
the size of this canyon.

19:58.875 --> 20:00.875
How... how'd you feel
when you thought you lost me?

20:03.583 --> 20:04.917
I was very torn up.

20:07.041 --> 20:09.250
Jack, you're like a brother to me.

20:09.333 --> 20:12.208
And just because brothers fight doesn't
mean they don't care about each other.

20:13.709 --> 20:15.625
I told you two this road trip
would bring you together.

20:17.291 --> 20:18.792
There's just one thing I feel bad about.

20:19.542 --> 20:21.208
My little skunk friend didn't make it.

20:22.834 --> 20:24.375
Hopefully he's in a better place

20:24.458 --> 20:27.083
and his soul will live
forever in this canyon.

20:30.291 --> 20:31.291
Guys?

20:31.709 --> 20:32.875
Guys, why are you running?

20:35.750 --> 20:38.250
-
- Oh. Oh, no!

20:43.875 --> 20:45.792
I'm glad we decided to stay the night.

20:46.166 --> 20:48.417
I can't believe you caught
all this delicious salmon.

20:48.500 --> 20:49.417
Didn't catch it.

20:49.750 --> 20:51.417
No, no, no. I...
I went down to the stream,

20:51.500 --> 20:54.667
and the friendliest grizzly bear
was just slapping fish up onto the shore.

20:55.917 --> 20:57.583
Yeah, I just grabbed a
couple, said thank you,

20:57.667 --> 20:59.875
and he growled this big,
hearty, "you're welcome."

21:03.875 --> 21:05.000
Yeah, it sounded just like that.

21:07.542 --> 21:08.583
Is that the bear?

21:11.083 --> 21:13.291
We should probably get out of here.

21:14.417 --> 21:16.750
-
- Jack? Milton?

21:27.417 --> 21:29.458
You should know
that I am a black belt in Karate.

21:57.166 --> 21:58.208
<i>Poor soul.</i>

22:02.000 --> 22:02.875
<i>Yes!</i>
