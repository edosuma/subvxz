WEBVTT

00:02.153 --> 00:03.494
Previously on "Nashville"...

00:03.495 --> 00:06.985
Rayna James wants to talk
about signing us. Aah!

00:06.996 --> 00:08.637
You said you wanted to start over clean.

00:09.541 --> 00:11.886
You owe me a life's supposed to be mine.

00:12.060 --> 00:13.640
What happened?
It's Jason.

00:13.972 --> 00:15.182
It's not your fault.

00:15.930 --> 00:18.391
Mom, is any of this true
about Deacon and Liam?

00:18.449 --> 00:19.235
Not a word.

00:19.747 --> 00:21.301
This producer out of Atlanta,

00:21.309 --> 00:22.753
I'm not sure it's what I should be doing.

00:22.875 --> 00:24.077
What the hell happened?

00:24.078 --> 00:25.604
Can you call her addiction counselor?

00:25.605 --> 00:27.852
You really think you can help us?
I do.

00:28.033 --> 00:29.466
I'd like you to be my deputy mayor.

00:29.823 --> 00:30.504
What do you say?

00:32.028 --> 00:34.625
♪ I might stay up, drunk on wine ♪

00:34.626 --> 00:36.587
♪ Hurtin' like hell, ugly cryin' ♪

00:36.588 --> 00:39.928
♪ Black mascara tears ♪

00:40.290 --> 00:42.781
♪ I might lock my door, sleep with my phone ♪

00:42.782 --> 00:44.745
♪ Miss you bad for a month or so ♪

00:44.746 --> 00:48.236
♪ But let me tell you something, my dear ♪

00:48.975 --> 00:49.545
Wait.

00:50.614 --> 00:51.897
Come on. Are you kidding me?

00:52.222 --> 00:54.136
That's every damn song I know, okay?

00:54.137 --> 00:54.685
Get back...

00:56.168 --> 00:56.691
look...

00:58.040 --> 00:59.209
I don't know what it is, okay?

00:59.210 --> 01:01.525
I fed you. You peed all
over the damn house,

01:01.526 --> 01:02.764
so I know it's not that.

01:03.194 --> 01:03.732
Where...

01:07.651 --> 01:08.531
Animal hospital.

01:08.967 --> 01:10.139
Yeah. Y'all open now?

01:10.372 --> 01:11.850
Yes, we are. Stop it.

01:12.082 --> 01:13.471
Well, good. I need your next appointment.

01:13.472 --> 01:15.015
Somebody gave me a defective dog.

01:15.016 --> 01:15.876
Stop it.

01:20.233 --> 01:21.368
Are you awake?

01:22.214 --> 01:22.820
Yeah.

01:23.728 --> 01:24.821
You want some breakfast?

01:26.770 --> 01:27.449
No, I'm fine.

01:30.141 --> 01:31.514
I don't see how you could be.

01:32.488 --> 01:33.594
I'm gonna call Bucky dawes

01:33.595 --> 01:36.128
and reschedule the thing with
Rayna and the record guy.

01:36.304 --> 01:37.336
Why would you do that?

01:39.173 --> 01:40.837
That's not something you should
have to deal with today.

01:40.838 --> 01:41.995
I told you, I'm fine.

01:44.507 --> 01:46.464
I just got a couple of things
I need to take care of.

01:46.986 --> 01:48.270
If you need any help or...

01:48.271 --> 01:50.220
Look, Scarlett, we slept together.

01:51.349 --> 01:52.258
It doesn't mean...

01:54.615 --> 01:55.797
It doesn't have to mean anything.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:04.369 --> 02:06.458
- Your sweater.
- Oh, thank you, honey.

02:06.459 --> 02:07.530
You need to put your clothes on.

02:07.531 --> 02:08.872
We need to leave for school in 15 minutes.

02:08.874 --> 02:09.966
- Will you tell Maddie?
- Yep.

02:09.967 --> 02:11.733
Thank you, darling. Hello, Miss Daphne.

02:11.796 --> 02:12.853
Morning, Mr. Bucky.

02:13.271 --> 02:14.791
Now what am I gonna do with these?

02:14.792 --> 02:15.823
Well, you asked for 'em.

02:15.824 --> 02:17.049
I know. I've been through 30 of 'em.

02:17.050 --> 02:20.222
Haven't had anybody we could
start a new label with.

02:20.298 --> 02:21.691
We're showcasing Scarlett and Gunnar today.

02:21.692 --> 02:23.653
They're good. They're great.

02:24.201 --> 02:25.501
But we need another great one,

02:25.502 --> 02:27.004
otherwise, Marshall's not gonna let us

02:27.219 --> 02:29.135
pull off this whole label, you know?

02:29.240 --> 02:30.592
Are you okay? You seem a little...

02:30.729 --> 02:33.429
Busy? You know I've been
up since 4:00 A.M.,

02:33.912 --> 02:35.616
running around in ten different directions.

02:35.617 --> 02:37.109
Oh, man.

02:38.290 --> 02:42.485
I feel like I'm in quicksand
on one leg, blindfolded.

02:42.486 --> 02:43.884
But, you know, nothing I can't handle.

02:44.189 --> 02:45.950
Talked to our crisis management friend.

02:45.951 --> 02:48.121
Ugh. Your crisis management friend.

02:48.122 --> 02:49.678
Well, she thinks people
wanna know the real story

02:49.679 --> 02:51.094
behind the divorce, the new label,

02:51.095 --> 02:52.493
the tour, the whole whirlwind.

02:52.494 --> 02:54.468
Katie Couric wants you
on her show this Friday.

02:54.810 --> 02:57.863
I am not going and spilling
my guts on Katie Couric.

02:57.864 --> 03:00.082
Well, Karen thinks it would
be a classy, exclusive way

03:00.083 --> 03:01.563
for you to address your fans' concerns

03:01.564 --> 03:04.194
and to tell it like it is, and
your manager thinks so, too.

03:05.440 --> 03:06.895
Can I find out what the
questions are first?

03:06.896 --> 03:08.215
Good morning, sunshine.

03:08.216 --> 03:08.998
Hey, Maddie.

03:15.891 --> 03:17.725
Can you excuse me for a moment, please?

03:17.754 --> 03:18.441
Yeah.

03:21.840 --> 03:22.431
Hey.

03:24.540 --> 03:25.956
I know today's a hard day,

03:26.294 --> 03:27.813
and it's a lot of change for all of us.

03:28.314 --> 03:30.846
But I just... I don't
think that's an excuse

03:30.847 --> 03:33.161
for you to be rude to anybody,

03:33.162 --> 03:34.652
especially not to Bucky or to me.

03:34.653 --> 03:36.806
Can I go to the mall with
Talia after school today?

03:37.925 --> 03:39.709
No, because you've got homework,

03:39.710 --> 03:41.731
and 'cause your dad's
taking over tonight...

03:41.732 --> 03:42.826
give me one good reason.

03:42.827 --> 03:45.876
I just gave you two. But
I'll give you two more,

03:45.877 --> 03:47.228
'cause I'm the mother, and I said so.

03:47.231 --> 03:48.895
You're such a bitch sometimes.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.396
I beg your pardon.

03:50.397 --> 03:51.844
No wonder dad left.

03:51.889 --> 03:52.826
What?

03:55.307 --> 03:57.215
You are not going anywhere anytime soon.

03:59.469 --> 04:00.191
Churchill said,

04:00.192 --> 04:02.705
"there's only one thing worse
than fighting with allies,

04:02.706 --> 04:04.206
and that's fighting without them."

04:04.655 --> 04:07.265
It's in that spirit that I'd
like to introduce you all

04:07.266 --> 04:08.548
to the newest member of my team.

04:08.712 --> 04:10.475
He's been a friend of mine for 20 years

04:11.074 --> 04:14.222
and an advocate for this
city his entire career...

04:14.330 --> 04:15.373
Coleman Carlisle.

04:16.450 --> 04:17.339
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

04:19.378 --> 04:21.776
I gotta admit, when the
mayor first called me,

04:21.815 --> 04:23.865
I was hoping he was gonna
tell me he decided to resign.

04:25.651 --> 04:27.683
But seriously, mayor Teddy Conrad

04:27.785 --> 04:29.283
believes that this city's challenges

04:29.284 --> 04:31.651
require an all-hands-on-deck approach.

04:32.040 --> 04:34.228
And although we may
disagree on some things,

04:34.229 --> 04:37.528
we do agree on that, and
it's in that spirit, sir,

04:37.829 --> 04:40.456
that I'm pleased to serve
as your deputy mayor.

04:40.482 --> 04:41.703
Thank you very much, Mr. Mayor.

04:41.713 --> 04:42.531
Welcome aboard.

04:42.808 --> 04:43.480
Thank you.

04:49.177 --> 04:50.344
Juliette. Marshall.

04:50.557 --> 04:52.868
Thought by now maybe I'd
be meeting a new manager.

04:53.327 --> 04:56.324
Oh, well, I haven't found the need.

04:56.560 --> 04:57.669
And besides, I think it's time

04:57.670 --> 04:59.654
for me to sit at the
adult table, don't you?

05:00.294 --> 05:02.524
So tell me about our launch plan.

05:02.525 --> 05:03.953
Well, Lindsay and our marketing group

05:03.954 --> 05:05.695
have come up with a solid roll-out plan

05:05.696 --> 05:07.069
for next month's release.

05:07.348 --> 05:09.649
We'll be doing Kimmel,
"G.M.A.",  radio, print,

05:09.650 --> 05:12.296
and we've booked several
private, intimate fan club shows

05:12.297 --> 05:13.680
like the one this afternoon.

05:13.681 --> 05:15.409
Those have always generated a lot of buzz.

05:15.621 --> 05:18.442
And let me guess... with your
usual boring web sites.

05:18.895 --> 05:21.122
Basically, you're planning
a traditional roll-out,

05:21.123 --> 05:23.489
which works for somebody like Rayna,

05:23.490 --> 05:25.969
but we're not exactly
of the same generation.

05:25.970 --> 05:27.711
It's exactly what we did successfully

05:27.712 --> 05:28.783
for your previous album.

05:28.784 --> 05:31.340
Right. But this one is different.

05:31.989 --> 05:33.366
And I'm different as an artist,

05:33.367 --> 05:35.996
and I want my fans to be excited
about what I'm doing now.

05:35.997 --> 05:36.831
Tell you what, Juliette.

05:36.851 --> 05:38.992
How about you let us do
what we know how to do,

05:38.993 --> 05:40.916
and you do what you know how to do?

05:42.557 --> 05:45.729
Superstar Avery Barkley! My man.

05:45.941 --> 05:48.235
Come meet my dream team.

05:48.336 --> 05:50.076
I want them to feel you, look at you.

05:50.077 --> 05:51.130
Catch your vibe.

05:51.356 --> 05:53.487
We love the new tracks, Avery. Huge fans.

05:53.721 --> 05:54.972
Oh, wow, you heard 'em already?

05:54.973 --> 05:56.784
Haven't even finished mixing 'em, right?

05:56.785 --> 05:58.413
Domino sent out roughs last week.

05:58.414 --> 06:01.093
Yep, and I have some y'all
ain't even hear yet.

06:01.418 --> 06:03.845
You gon' flip out. I'm-a take
you to another level, man.

06:05.472 --> 06:05.986
Play it.

06:08.237 --> 06:10.201
♪ I know I've seen an angel ♪

06:10.466 --> 06:12.493
♪ I know it made me cry 

06:12.720 --> 06:15.310
♪ So when I look in heaven, 

06:17.262 --> 06:19.225
Killer, killer, killer.

06:19.469 --> 06:20.039
You sound killer.

06:20.040 --> 06:21.908
You never heard yourself
sound like that before.

06:22.266 --> 06:23.146
No, I haven't.

06:23.147 --> 06:25.487
Oh, yeah, and this ain't electronic.

06:25.751 --> 06:27.277
This what I call innovation.

06:27.278 --> 06:28.673
Oh, y'all know what I'm-a call this.

06:28.796 --> 06:31.997
"East Nashville meets dubstep."

06:32.109 --> 06:33.952
They're gonna love this in Europe.
You know, I don't know

06:33.953 --> 06:36.837
if dubstep's the way to go
with this particular song.

06:38.120 --> 06:38.974
I think it is.

06:45.053 --> 06:46.719
That man is infuriating.

06:46.880 --> 06:48.851
He has no imagination, no vision.

06:49.534 --> 06:52.063
He's a talking corporation,
and that roll-out plan?

06:52.317 --> 06:53.552
Well, the event today seems nice.

06:53.553 --> 06:55.342
The venue's exclusive and intimate.

06:55.373 --> 06:57.108
"Intimate" is code for "small."

06:57.727 --> 06:59.028
What time is that show again?

06:59.082 --> 07:00.555
04:00. Why?

07:01.153 --> 07:03.167
Because it's not just for the fan club.

07:03.812 --> 07:05.243
I just invited the world.

07:09.147 --> 07:14.047
<font color="#40bfff">Sync by YYeTS</font>
<font color="#40bfff">Corrections by <font color="#FFA500">wilson0804</font></font>
<font color="#40bfff">www.Addic7ed.com</font>

07:28.488 --> 07:29.911
No, he's gonna settle in fine.

07:29.912 --> 07:31.617
He just needs to get used
to his surroundings.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.916
You sure? 'Cause he was just,
like, moaning and whining,

07:33.917 --> 07:35.191
just carrying on all night.

07:35.193 --> 07:36.716
Yeah. It's called a puppy.

07:38.079 --> 07:40.146
So have you thought about
microchipping him?

07:40.387 --> 07:42.655
I mean, isn't that what dog tags are for?

07:43.225 --> 07:44.221
Old school. Nice. I like it.

07:44.222 --> 07:45.779
Could you hold him for a sec? Sure.

07:45.788 --> 07:47.186
So what would those dog tags say?

07:47.187 --> 07:49.407
'Cause it's, uh, left blank here.

07:49.408 --> 07:51.181
Uh, just got 'em the other day.

07:51.182 --> 07:53.393
I barely decided to keep
him, let alone name him.

07:53.394 --> 07:54.920
You're kidding. Right?

07:55.148 --> 07:56.348
I mean, how could you not keep...

07:56.349 --> 07:57.631
This little mush face?

07:58.572 --> 07:59.430
I'll probably keep him.

07:59.950 --> 08:01.652
You think he, uh, would travel all right,

08:01.653 --> 08:02.452
like on the road?

08:02.507 --> 08:03.800
Why? Are you a truck driver?

08:04.325 --> 08:07.393
Uh... no. I'm a musician.

08:07.776 --> 08:10.058
Oh. Yeah. Of course you are.
Everyone here is.

08:10.059 --> 08:11.903
So are you famous or something or...

08:13.726 --> 08:14.557
Or something.

08:14.809 --> 08:16.684
Ah, well, I apologize for not knowing.

08:16.685 --> 08:19.304
I just, to be honest with you,
don't really like country...

08:19.305 --> 08:21.435
I kind of hate country music. Really?

08:21.436 --> 08:22.426
Yeah. Pretty much. Oh. Oh.

08:22.427 --> 08:24.003
Well, how do you know I play country music?

08:24.004 --> 08:25.910
Huh? Bit of an assumption, isn't it?

08:25.911 --> 08:27.485
The cowboy boots, flannel shirt.

08:27.486 --> 08:29.661
If you are not country,
you are lost, my friend.

08:29.662 --> 08:31.348
Well, I could say the same thing about you.

08:31.623 --> 08:33.995
I'm thinking... San Francisco

08:33.996 --> 08:35.154
by way of...

08:36.385 --> 08:37.433
Colorado.

08:38.729 --> 08:40.179
Oh, nailed it.

08:41.246 --> 08:42.155
I've been here five weeks.

08:42.155 --> 08:43.936
I haven't found any dim sum yet.

08:43.943 --> 08:45.203
Tell you what. Why don't let me, uh,

08:45.403 --> 08:46.775
drop my anonymous dog off at home,

08:46.776 --> 08:48.044
and I'll take you out to lunch?

08:48.425 --> 08:50.483
I know the area. I'll
give you the nickel tour.

08:53.031 --> 08:55.241
Detective. Gunnar Scott.

08:55.924 --> 08:57.737
I wanna know if you're any
closer to identifying

08:57.738 --> 08:59.298
who was involved in Jason's death.

08:59.299 --> 09:00.347
Somebody from Texas or...

09:00.348 --> 09:01.763
well, from what we've gathered,

09:01.764 --> 09:04.569
it seems your brother was in
a local drug deal gone bad.

09:05.154 --> 09:06.694
Nah, nah, Jason didn't do drugs.

09:07.042 --> 09:08.416
Well, maybe he sold them, then.

09:08.991 --> 09:10.673
Either way, it was an altercation

09:10.674 --> 09:13.304
in an area of town we know
has criminal activity.

09:13.347 --> 09:15.729
It's known for it. We're working on it.

09:16.500 --> 09:17.664
Well, like you are now?

09:18.293 --> 09:20.910
Look... you seem like a nice enough kid.

09:20.911 --> 09:22.170
So let me share something with you.

09:22.371 --> 09:24.301
Right here... these are four files

09:24.302 --> 09:25.998
of innocent individuals who were murdered.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.614
Your brother, with all due respect,

09:27.751 --> 09:29.879
was a felon who had violated his parole.

09:29.880 --> 09:31.845
Look, he was trying to get
his life back on track.

09:32.184 --> 09:33.752
I'm sorry for your loss.

09:34.121 --> 09:35.780
But the fact is, if he were trying

09:35.781 --> 09:37.080
to get his life back together,

09:37.359 --> 09:39.211
I don't think he would
have been at a bar like

09:39.418 --> 09:40.520
the last time around.

09:43.240 --> 09:46.470
So I just wanted to let you know
that I am leaving the house.

09:46.471 --> 09:47.443
Okay, thanks.

09:47.444 --> 09:49.738
Oh, and by the way, Maddie
called today at lunch.

09:49.866 --> 09:52.157
Oh, I bet she did. Well, look, she's upset.

09:52.158 --> 09:52.894
She doesn't understand why

09:52.895 --> 09:54.183
we're going through with this divorce

09:54.184 --> 09:55.802
if we're gonna be taking
turns at the house.

09:55.803 --> 09:57.388
Well, she's also grounded.

09:57.725 --> 09:58.277
For what?

09:58.477 --> 10:01.428
For being rude to me and to Bucky.

10:01.429 --> 10:03.275
Is that it? Yeah. You know,
I just wanna make sure

10:03.276 --> 10:05.105
you can be here at 6:00 tonight.

10:05.106 --> 10:06.301
Yeah. Uh-huh.

10:06.718 --> 10:07.905
You're gonna be here at 6:00? Yeah.

10:08.437 --> 10:10.441
Right. Right. I'll be there 6:00 P.M.

10:10.637 --> 10:12.367
Okay, 'cause if you can't, I can do it.

10:12.368 --> 10:14.019
I can take 'em to dinner. I'm here.

10:14.056 --> 10:16.111
Look, this may come as a shock to you...

10:16.444 --> 10:18.320
But I actually know what I'm
doing with our daughters.

10:18.321 --> 10:19.323
Now is there anything else?

10:19.375 --> 10:22.076
Um... yeah.

10:22.433 --> 10:26.236
With Peggy... you know, I know
she's your new special...

10:26.237 --> 10:29.068
Financial consultant to special projects.

10:29.122 --> 10:30.041
Mm-hmm.

10:30.264 --> 10:32.501
Well, if you could keep
your special project-ing

10:32.502 --> 10:33.827
out of the family home,

10:34.745 --> 10:36.403
I would really appreciate that.

10:40.020 --> 10:40.654
Hello?

11:13.252 --> 11:14.982
Your first tour when you came to mobile...

11:16.009 --> 11:17.790
I waited outside that entrance for you,

11:17.791 --> 11:18.450
and I saw you,

11:18.451 --> 11:19.450
and you looked so pretty,

11:19.451 --> 11:22.040
and everybody was out there
hollering your name,

11:22.041 --> 11:23.010
and I was, too.

11:23.011 --> 11:26.046
And you saw me, and I put
my arms out to hug you,

11:26.047 --> 11:27.700
and you just walked right by me.

11:27.701 --> 11:30.019
What are you ta... that is not true, okay?

11:30.020 --> 11:32.293
You must have hallucinated that
during one of your binges.

11:32.294 --> 11:33.800
No, I was sober by then.

11:33.801 --> 11:35.306
I mean, it was only a week or so, but...

11:35.307 --> 11:36.577
I didn't see you. Yes,

11:36.578 --> 11:38.322
you are remember it wrong. You... no...

11:38.435 --> 11:40.361
don't... don't say that.
It's dismissive and...

11:40.362 --> 11:42.516
and unfair, okay? Your mother's
entitled to her own memories,

11:42.517 --> 11:44.691
and if you think she's
mistaken, then say that.

11:44.692 --> 11:47.119
She's mistaken. Juliette, I am not.

11:47.365 --> 11:48.712
You know what? It... it feels like

11:48.713 --> 11:50.061
we've been talking about this for days,

11:50.062 --> 11:51.841
and all I'm hearing about are sad stories,

11:51.842 --> 11:53.534
most of which aren't even true. Hey...

11:53.535 --> 11:56.758
jolene, would you excuse us for a moment?

12:02.604 --> 12:04.140
What are you, my third grade teacher?

12:04.877 --> 12:06.200
You said you'd participate.

12:06.201 --> 12:08.836
I am participating, and
if you can't see that,

12:08.844 --> 12:11.205
then I need to seriously
question your credentials.

12:11.555 --> 12:13.823
I mean, what are your qualifications?

12:13.979 --> 12:15.358
Are you a therapist?

12:15.359 --> 12:17.411
Did you read some self-help book? What?

12:17.412 --> 12:18.497
You know what qualifies me?

12:19.447 --> 12:21.603
Having a hundred falls worse
than any of your mom's,

12:21.621 --> 12:22.718
and from a hell of a lot higher,

12:22.719 --> 12:24.208
and I came out on the other side.

12:24.549 --> 12:25.739
You're not the only survivor here.

12:31.338 --> 12:33.320
That was, uh... some tour.

12:33.873 --> 12:34.906
Well, thank you.

12:35.756 --> 12:37.016
What can I say? I love the area.

12:37.742 --> 12:39.459
I think we hit all the important spots.

12:40.483 --> 12:41.473
You know, I don't do this.

12:42.547 --> 12:43.440
Oh, me either.

12:43.636 --> 12:46.223
No, I mean, I actually
really don't do this,

12:46.363 --> 12:47.065
like, ever.

12:48.299 --> 12:48.906
Okay.

12:53.673 --> 12:54.506
Hey, why don't we, uh,

12:54.552 --> 12:56.232
go get that lunch we were talking about?

12:56.233 --> 12:58.394
No, it's fine. We don't
have to do that... lunch.

12:58.395 --> 13:01.100
I know we don't have to. I'm
just saying I'd like to.

13:01.101 --> 13:01.815
I'm hungry.

13:04.713 --> 13:05.478
Except I can't.

13:05.479 --> 13:07.907
I'm... I'm so sorry.

13:07.908 --> 13:09.859
I just... I realized I gotta
meet Juliette for a gig

13:09.860 --> 13:11.650
in, like, less than an hour.

13:12.463 --> 13:13.326
No. You know what? It's fine.

13:13.584 --> 13:15.180
It's a real thing. I mean, I...
no, you know what? It's okay.

13:15.411 --> 13:18.472
Um... I have an akita at 4:00.

13:18.495 --> 13:21.809
Well, we could... I mean, a
surgery on an akita at 4:00.

13:22.012 --> 13:23.036
Do me a favor.

13:23.341 --> 13:24.396
Name your dog.

13:29.494 --> 13:30.393
What are you looking at?

13:32.611 --> 13:34.228
Hi, Gunnar. Um, I thought we were gonna

13:34.229 --> 13:37.578
head into showcase together, but
I-I guess I'll see you there,

13:37.814 --> 13:40.149
so, um, give me a call.

13:49.883 --> 13:51.932
I am trying to hear your concerns, Avery,

13:51.933 --> 13:54.146
but frankly... frankly,
you should be honored

13:54.147 --> 13:55.215
to defer to Dominic.

13:55.216 --> 13:57.071
He has a great track record,

13:57.072 --> 13:58.361
years of experience. There is no...

13:58.362 --> 14:00.449
look, I respect the man. I do.

14:00.644 --> 14:01.453
But what he played in there

14:01.454 --> 14:04.350
doesn't sound like anything I'd
listen to, let alone perform.

14:04.869 --> 14:05.700
You don't like it?

14:07.947 --> 14:08.571
He didn't mean that.

14:08.572 --> 14:10.928
Please understand. My music's all I got.

14:10.929 --> 14:12.001
Well, correction...

14:12.250 --> 14:14.460
your music's all I got.
You signed a contract.

14:14.461 --> 14:16.394
Just give me a shot at remixing
those tracks a little.

14:16.395 --> 14:18.029
Maybe we can find some
kind of happy medium.

14:18.030 --> 14:19.485
Bro, I ain't trying to compromise.

14:19.486 --> 14:21.040
Dominic, this isn't me.

14:21.427 --> 14:23.043
You wanted success.

14:23.044 --> 14:24.836
You sign onto the label,
and I give it to you.

14:24.982 --> 14:27.194
If I like it, that's what it is,

14:27.358 --> 14:28.435
and that's who you are.

14:42.618 --> 14:44.343
Gentlemen. Sir, I tried to stop him, but...

14:44.344 --> 14:45.462
uh, it's all right.

14:46.451 --> 14:48.111
Never thought I'd see this.

14:48.977 --> 14:50.985
That was quite a press
conference you two threw.

14:50.986 --> 14:52.650
Was that supposed to send a message?

14:52.651 --> 14:54.985
No. No. Just a pragmatic appointment.

14:55.477 --> 14:56.977
Coleman's an experienced councilman.

14:56.978 --> 14:58.342
He knows this city inside and out.

14:58.343 --> 15:00.317
Yeah, one that has no intention

15:00.971 --> 15:04.079
of supporting my stadium, so
the larger question becomes

15:04.248 --> 15:05.771
if you share in that philosophy

15:05.772 --> 15:07.397
or if you're a man of your word.

15:07.816 --> 15:10.309
I'm building a stadium,
just not on your land.

15:11.122 --> 15:12.127
Excuse me?

15:12.807 --> 15:15.078
We, uh, we're made aware
of a parcel of land, uh...

15:15.214 --> 15:16.631
easier access, cheaper.

15:17.033 --> 15:18.214
Better locale for the city.

15:18.374 --> 15:19.466
That's what's important, right?

15:21.481 --> 15:22.435
AAA

15:22.436 --> 15:23.997
Subway park.

15:23.998 --> 15:25.818
They've expressed interest
in the naming rights.

15:28.533 --> 15:30.088
You need to have a seat, Teddy.

15:30.286 --> 15:32.280
I'd like very much to remind both of you

15:32.281 --> 15:33.584
just who got you here.

15:35.879 --> 15:36.859
Sorry to disturb you, sir,

15:36.860 --> 15:38.300
but your daughter Maddie's on the line.

15:38.301 --> 15:38.938
Thank you.

15:45.001 --> 15:46.150
Hi, honey. Everything okay?

15:46.284 --> 15:47.902
Okay, so I know mom said I'm grounded,

15:48.148 --> 15:49.673
but she also said I have to do my homework.

15:49.674 --> 15:51.324
And it's this group
history project... right.

15:51.489 --> 15:53.645
That I can only do at Talia's.

15:54.224 --> 15:56.253
That's fine. Are her
parents gonna be there?

15:56.782 --> 15:57.848
Yes, dad, of course.

15:58.581 --> 16:00.490
Okay. Just be home in time for dinner.

16:00.679 --> 16:01.545
All right.

16:02.415 --> 16:04.124
I told you it'd be easy. Come on.

16:04.125 --> 16:05.511
AAA

16:05.512 --> 16:06.779
Aah! Juliette!

16:07.002 --> 16:08.743
Hey, Gunnar, it's me... again.

16:08.843 --> 16:10.019
Surprise. Um...

16:11.326 --> 16:13.304
Can you just give me a call,

16:13.305 --> 16:14.407
tell me you're all right?

16:15.197 --> 16:16.731
Or get here... would be good. Um...

16:18.788 --> 16:19.624
Pick up your phone.

16:21.167 --> 16:22.486
If I had a nickel for every time

16:22.487 --> 16:24.692
I've had to wait for a
damn guitar player...

16:24.769 --> 16:27.172
Whoa. You'd think you
were the one auditioning.

16:27.173 --> 16:28.052
I kind of am.

16:28.539 --> 16:29.572
Rayna. Bucky.

16:29.573 --> 16:30.997
Hey, Marshall. Marshall. Good to see you.

16:30.998 --> 16:33.671
How are you? It's great to see you, too.

16:34.091 --> 16:36.672
Good. Yeah. This is gonna be fun.

16:36.673 --> 16:39.865
Yeah. I'm so excited for
you to hear these kids,

16:39.866 --> 16:41.922
and I just think this'll be
the start of something great.

16:41.999 --> 16:43.073
Well, just bring me

16:43.074 --> 16:44.733
another Rayna Jaymes and Juliette Barnes,

16:44.734 --> 16:45.511
and I'll be happy.

16:45.585 --> 16:46.887
Or two Rayna Jaymes.

16:48.155 --> 16:48.782
Yeah.

16:52.338 --> 16:54.770
Do you wanna go see if...
if they're here, and...

16:54.801 --> 16:55.643
Yes. Yeah.

16:55.900 --> 16:57.224
Great. Okay. Good.

16:57.718 --> 16:59.401
Good, good. Okay, well...

16:59.469 --> 17:02.075
Shall we? Sure. How's the...
how's the family? How's...

17:02.076 --> 17:03.913
Good. Good. Everything's good. Oh.

17:10.964 --> 17:12.801
How y'all doin'?!

17:15.627 --> 17:16.470
Isn't this awesome?!

17:16.471 --> 17:18.019
This is way more than 50 people!

17:18.020 --> 17:20.396
Yeah, but it's exciting!

Stop!

You okay?

18:37.660 --> 18:39.222
Just don't tell my mom.

18:48.054 --> 18:49.876
Xxx

18:49.877 --> 18:52.335
Look, Rayna, I don't know
if these two characters

18:52.336 --> 18:54.048
aren't taking you seriously,

18:54.049 --> 18:56.807
or if you just made the wrong
choice in selecting them,

18:56.808 --> 18:59.002
but I've got another meeting.

18:59.003 --> 19:00.391
I gotta get going. Hey, Marshall...

19:00.392 --> 19:01.854
Uh, guys, I'm afraid we're
gonna have to make do

19:01.855 --> 19:03.574
with just one today.

19:05.492 --> 19:08.603
Ms. Jaymes, Mr. Evans,
I'm so terribly sorry.

19:08.604 --> 19:10.179
I cannot imagine what
has happened to Gunnar,

19:10.180 --> 19:11.820
but I'm sure he'll be here any second.

19:11.821 --> 19:13.031
Well, I hope he's all right,

19:13.032 --> 19:15.490
but, Rayna, we're gonna have
to do this another time.

19:16.057 --> 19:19.564
Uh, Scarlett, how would you feel
about playing one of your songs

19:19.565 --> 19:20.783
to kind of give us a taste?

19:20.784 --> 19:23.418
If that would be okay with you, Marshall?

19:24.817 --> 19:26.939
Yeah. Yeah. All right.

19:28.321 --> 19:30.315
All right. Great. Great.

19:31.825 --> 19:32.443
Thanks, Scarlett.

19:32.444 --> 19:35.798
Just make yourself
comfortable, and... great.

So sorry, Scarlett.

20:51.076 --> 20:53.935
Excuse me. Can you tell me
where Maddie Conrad is?

20:53.936 --> 20:56.070
Ms. Jaymes. I didn't...
let me check for ya.

20:56.071 --> 20:57.687
Rayna. How is she?

20:57.688 --> 20:59.315
I-I don't know. I just got here.
Right this way.

20:59.316 --> 21:01.303
She was hit in the head, I guess.
Hit in the head?

21:01.304 --> 21:03.024
Yeah, what happened? I have no idea.

21:03.025 --> 21:05.163
How can you not know what happened?

21:07.217 --> 21:08.779
Hey, baby. Mom. Baby.

21:08.780 --> 21:09.803
I got knocked.

21:09.804 --> 21:11.014
She's fine.

21:11.513 --> 21:12.697
I'm sorry.

21:12.698 --> 21:13.707
Oh, we're just glad you're okay.

21:13.708 --> 21:16.211
We're gonna take her for a C.T.
just to rule out any concussion.

21:16.212 --> 21:18.302
Can we go with her? It'll
just take a minute.

21:18.613 --> 21:20.494
Honey, we'll wait right here, all right?

21:29.844 --> 21:31.310
Hey. How's she doing?

21:31.796 --> 21:33.407
She's... she's gonna be fine.

21:34.867 --> 21:36.894
Uh, I need to make a phone call. Excuse me.

21:39.315 --> 21:40.925
He didn't even know where she was.

21:41.396 --> 21:42.159
Yeah, well, I think you slipped out

21:42.160 --> 21:43.801
once or twice at her age.

21:43.802 --> 21:44.647
Yeah.

21:44.648 --> 21:46.115
Long as she's okay, right?

21:46.426 --> 21:49.219
Yeah. Thank you. I'm really grateful.

21:49.714 --> 21:51.389
All right, come on. She's like family.

21:51.458 --> 21:52.429
Yeah.

21:53.138 --> 21:54.875
Let me know how she's
doing, all right? Yeah.

21:55.584 --> 21:56.778
Okay. Oh.

21:58.704 --> 21:59.418
For her.

21:59.419 --> 22:00.518
Thank you.

22:01.571 --> 22:02.798
What the hell happened? No, wait...

22:02.799 --> 22:03.755
Any liability lies with the venue.

22:03.756 --> 22:05.771
Hello? I understand, but...

22:05.772 --> 22:06.931
Why were there so many people there?

22:06.932 --> 22:08.423
All you had to do was handle the details

22:08.424 --> 22:09.348
of one little show.

22:09.349 --> 22:11.089
Is somebody gonna answer the damn door?!

22:11.090 --> 22:12.921
I can't do this, okay?
I'm just an assistant.

22:12.922 --> 22:14.204
My last job was at the mall.

22:14.205 --> 22:15.513
Okay, your job is not that difficult.

22:15.514 --> 22:17.380
Okay, I-I know. My mother is an
addict, and she could do it.

22:17.381 --> 22:19.195
Well, I can't, not by myself.

22:19.196 --> 22:22.063
Oh. My assistant needs an assistant.
Unbelievable.

22:22.064 --> 22:23.043
Weren't you just here?

22:23.044 --> 22:24.571
We have an afternoon session, too.

22:24.572 --> 22:26.486
We've got yoga and then
we've got therapy, and...

22:26.487 --> 22:27.555
Not too late to join.

22:27.556 --> 22:30.091
Uh, I'm kind of in the middle of
handling a major crisis here,

22:30.092 --> 22:31.355
if you haven't noticed.

22:31.356 --> 22:32.566
Oh, I noticed.

22:37.861 --> 22:38.927
You're early.

22:39.766 --> 22:42.496
Yeah, well, Dominic says on time is late.

22:42.997 --> 22:44.352
Yes, he does.

22:44.856 --> 22:47.658
I gotta grab some mics. Back in a bit.

22:47.659 --> 22:48.631
All right.

23:07.692 --> 23:09.228
What happened to you this afternoon?

23:09.229 --> 23:10.390
Things came up.

23:12.540 --> 23:13.974
You been drinkin' all day?

23:15.229 --> 23:16.742
Guilty as charged.

23:25.616 --> 23:27.690
I respect that you are grieving,

23:28.544 --> 23:30.937
and I know that you're blaming
all this on yourself,

23:31.722 --> 23:32.226
and... you shouldn't,

23:32.227 --> 23:34.114
but you are treating me like absolute dirt,

23:34.115 --> 23:35.396
and I wish you would stop.

23:35.397 --> 23:36.795
Well, I'm sorry if your feelings are hurt,

23:36.796 --> 23:37.972
but you have no idea
what I'm going through.

23:37.973 --> 23:39.128
Oh, you're right! I'm so stupid!

23:39.129 --> 23:40.516
I should have canceled that thing today,

23:40.517 --> 23:41.968
but I didn't, and you could have just

23:41.969 --> 23:42.859
picked up the phone... seriously?

23:42.860 --> 23:44.949
So I knew you were all right!
Seriously?! Seriously?!

23:45.724 --> 23:48.182
My brother cannot play
music anymore, Scarlett.

23:48.683 --> 23:50.484
Not... not for you, not for me,

23:50.485 --> 23:53.183
not for Rayna. That's 'cause
he's dead, all right?

23:54.083 --> 23:55.214
I know.

23:56.026 --> 23:57.591
The police are gonna help us find out why.

23:57.592 --> 23:59.802
They are not. They think he's
just some piece of trash

23:59.803 --> 24:01.555
lying in an alley behind
the last time around.

24:01.556 --> 24:03.243
Whoever killed him is still out there!

24:05.842 --> 24:07.580
I know. I'm sorry.

24:07.603 --> 24:10.172
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

24:19.042 --> 24:20.652
You need to stop doing that.

24:22.562 --> 24:23.997
I don't need your pity.

25:09.689 --> 25:12.141
Can you shed some light
on what she was doing

25:12.142 --> 25:14.523
at that Juliette Barnes
show in the first place?

25:14.524 --> 25:16.489
She told me that she was
going over to Talia's

25:16.490 --> 25:19.068
to work on a history project
with some of her friends

25:19.069 --> 25:20.749
and that Talia's parents
were gonna be there.

25:20.750 --> 25:22.217
But I told you she was grounded.

25:22.218 --> 25:23.491
I understand that.

25:23.825 --> 25:25.992
You know what? I'm gonna
cancel this trip to New York.

25:25.993 --> 25:27.850
I wanna be home with the girls this week.

25:27.851 --> 25:30.379
Okay, look. Do whatever
you want about your trip,

25:30.380 --> 25:32.364
but you're not coming
to the house this week.

25:32.365 --> 25:33.169
That's our agreement,

25:33.170 --> 25:35.291
and we're gonna stick to it. We need to.

25:36.130 --> 25:39.066
I think these are extenuating
circumstances, Teddy.

25:39.105 --> 25:40.079
She needs her mom.

25:40.080 --> 25:42.011
Frankly, she needs a parent
who's gonna take care of her.

25:42.012 --> 25:43.903
If memory serves, you missed your share

25:43.904 --> 25:45.412
of stitches and sprains over the years.

25:45.413 --> 25:47.919
So I'm sorry, Rayna, but you
don't get to run this one.

25:48.116 --> 25:50.056
Hey. There she is. You all set?

25:50.057 --> 25:51.941
All clear. She's good to go.

25:51.942 --> 25:53.907
Hi, sweetie. How you feeling?

25:53.912 --> 25:55.284
Tell your mom good-bye.

25:57.432 --> 25:58.948
This is from Uncle Deacon.

25:58.949 --> 25:59.999
Thanks.

26:00.404 --> 26:03.940
I need to... stay and do some paperwork.

26:03.941 --> 26:07.140
But, um, you call me anytime
you want to, all right?

26:07.141 --> 26:08.856
I'm gonna see you this weekend.

26:08.857 --> 26:09.859
Okay.

26:09.870 --> 26:11.048
I love you.

26:15.824 --> 26:16.810
Ready?

26:28.054 --> 26:29.378
Melee in the gulch...

26:29.379 --> 26:31.827
as reported earlier, singer Juliette Barnes

26:31.828 --> 26:34.915
sparked the frenzy with her
tweet about a surprise show,

26:34.916 --> 26:37.792
which left six young people
with minor injuries.

26:37.793 --> 26:39.257
The injured, who range in age

26:39.258 --> 26:41.772
from 12 to 19... baby, that
had to have been awful.

26:41.773 --> 26:44.007
Can't we sue them for trying
to blame this all on me?

26:44.008 --> 26:45.430
They didn't exactly say that.

26:45.431 --> 26:46.851
Well, they implied it.

26:51.033 --> 26:52.675
Oh, great.

26:54.120 --> 26:55.444
I've been meaning to call you.

26:55.445 --> 26:56.730
Yeah, well, you didn't, you know,

26:56.731 --> 26:59.301
and I've just been at the E.R.
with my child

26:59.931 --> 27:02.844
and a bunch of other kids
who got hurt at your show.

27:02.845 --> 27:04.011
Why is everybody trying to act

27:04.012 --> 27:05.558
like this is completely my fault?

27:05.559 --> 27:08.147
Because it is completely your fault!

27:08.148 --> 27:10.887
Man, girl, you don't take
responsibility for anything!

27:10.888 --> 27:12.119
I don't know what you're doin',

27:12.120 --> 27:15.474
but you hurt people
around you all the time.

27:16.168 --> 27:17.426
Wake up!

27:18.456 --> 27:19.602
God.

27:21.032 --> 27:22.066
Tell you what.

27:22.377 --> 27:24.203
Whole thing could have gone a
lot more sideways than it did,

27:24.204 --> 27:25.270
we're just lucky.

27:27.419 --> 27:29.926
Don't eat that. Don't eat that. Come on.

27:30.208 --> 27:32.488
Man, that's... that's not a
practical birthday gift, man.

27:32.489 --> 27:33.456
Yeah, tell me about it.

27:33.457 --> 27:35.163
Damn thing kept me up all night.

27:36.001 --> 27:37.105
You know, you gotta get him shots,

27:37.106 --> 27:38.023
and you gotta fix your place up...

27:38.024 --> 27:40.328
I know what they need, Cole.
I got his shots.

27:40.329 --> 27:41.908
I already took it to the vet.

27:42.291 --> 27:44.923
You should see this vet, too. Pretty girl.

27:45.585 --> 27:47.003
Don't sleep with her.

27:47.474 --> 27:48.428
What?

27:51.409 --> 27:52.544
You already slept with her.

27:52.545 --> 27:54.010
Just shut up, man.

27:55.777 --> 27:56.778
What?

27:57.233 --> 27:58.709
I'm-a call you Mr. One-and-done.

27:58.710 --> 28:00.865
What are you talking about, "one-and-done"?

28:01.846 --> 28:05.076
I don't know. You just...
seems like you're just

28:05.077 --> 28:07.359
trying to keep yourself available.

28:07.360 --> 28:08.409
I don't know.

28:09.217 --> 28:10.070
You sure you're not drinkin'?

28:10.071 --> 28:11.583
That's the dumbest damn
thing I've ever heard.

28:11.584 --> 28:12.631
No, but here's my point...

28:12.632 --> 28:14.263
what's your point? My point is,

28:14.264 --> 28:15.730
when was the last time

28:16.476 --> 28:18.206
you got dressed up, made a reservation,

28:18.207 --> 28:19.556
picked a girl up at the door and...

28:19.557 --> 28:21.583
what, you mean, like, a date?
Like a proper date, yeah.

28:21.584 --> 28:23.402
A proper date? A proper date.

28:27.233 --> 28:28.234
All right?

28:28.944 --> 28:30.839
You ain't just hooked on booze and pills.

28:30.840 --> 28:32.922
You strung out on Rayna Jaymes.

28:35.424 --> 28:37.338
Maybe it's that whole damn family, huh?

28:37.504 --> 28:38.851
God only knows why you'd partner up

28:38.852 --> 28:40.539
with the man that tried to destroy you.

28:40.540 --> 28:42.311
Wanna talk about addiction, Cole?

28:42.957 --> 28:44.038
Let's talk.

28:58.588 --> 29:00.006
Where the hell have you been?

29:00.220 --> 29:02.262
Your music ain't where it's supposed to be.

29:02.624 --> 29:03.890
That's what I've been trying to tell you,

29:03.891 --> 29:05.122
but you didn't wanna listen.

29:05.123 --> 29:06.957
I'm talking about the masters.

29:07.427 --> 29:08.367
I burned 'em.

29:08.368 --> 29:10.202
Tell me your boy's joking right now!

29:10.203 --> 29:12.323
Do you have any idea how
much Dominic has billed us

29:12.324 --> 29:13.564
in producing fees?

29:13.565 --> 29:16.315
Here's $75k, the rest of
my publishing advance,

29:16.316 --> 29:18.342
minus a bus ticket to Nashville.

29:19.020 --> 29:20.502
Here are the keys to your car.

29:21.500 --> 29:22.838
You think it's that easy?

29:23.772 --> 29:24.796
And you.

29:24.797 --> 29:26.518
Good luck with your next big thing.

29:26.988 --> 29:27.903
It sure ain't me.

29:27.904 --> 29:30.986
Boy! You dead in this business!

29:31.233 --> 29:33.539
D.O.A.! Before you even started breathing!

29:33.540 --> 29:37.550
I don't know, man. I feel more
alive than I have in months.

29:42.788 --> 29:45.070
I made over $50 million.

29:45.780 --> 29:47.271
Man, that's even hard to imagine.

29:47.272 --> 29:50.034
Yeah, it didn't seem real, not even then.

29:50.489 --> 29:52.259
All of it gone in three years.

29:52.328 --> 29:55.111
Drugs, sex, cars.

29:55.112 --> 29:56.263
I bought a painting once that cost me

29:56.264 --> 29:58.311
more than my dad made in
his whole entire life.

29:58.312 --> 29:59.960
You had an addiction to money, too?

29:59.961 --> 30:01.490
Power. I...

30:01.832 --> 30:03.395
I think because at the root of it

30:03.396 --> 30:04.974
in a sense of weakness.

30:06.228 --> 30:07.533
I think the...

30:08.372 --> 30:11.374
The root of my addiction is
probably a feeling of, um...

30:12.405 --> 30:13.683
You know, I've pretty much failed
at everything

30:13.684 --> 30:14.958
I've ever done.

30:15.110 --> 30:17.882
I know that what happened
at Deacon's birthday party

30:17.883 --> 30:18.664
is my fault.

30:18.665 --> 30:19.954
I know that.

30:19.992 --> 30:23.211
But I... I keep telling myself stories

30:23.212 --> 30:26.294
and trying to... to take my mind off of it.

30:27.340 --> 30:28.535
But it's the truth.

30:29.036 --> 30:30.326
I know that.

30:30.752 --> 30:32.870
Being able to admit that is the first step.

30:34.268 --> 30:35.591
Get you a tissue.

30:49.276 --> 30:50.003
Deacon!

30:50.004 --> 30:51.358
I'm comin'!

30:52.936 --> 30:54.381
What's the matter? It's Gunnar.
He took off.

30:54.382 --> 30:56.074
He's gone all wild about what
happened to his brother.

30:56.075 --> 30:57.103
I think he's gonna do
something real stupid... oh,

30:57.104 --> 30:58.423
sweetie, that's just his pain talking.

30:58.424 --> 31:00.229
No, no, no, he's saying the
police aren't doing enough.

31:00.230 --> 31:01.698
I think he's gonna try do it himself.

31:01.699 --> 31:02.347
What'd he say?

31:02.348 --> 31:04.388
He was talking about the
bar Jason got killed at,

31:04.389 --> 31:05.316
and I know he's gonna be there.

31:05.317 --> 31:06.467
What's the name of the bar?

31:06.468 --> 31:08.637
Uh, the... last time around.

31:11.108 --> 31:12.735
Damn it. All right, you stay here.

31:12.736 --> 31:14.170
Like hell I'm staying here.

31:31.584 --> 31:32.575
Gunnar!

31:32.576 --> 31:33.488
What are you doing here?! Go home!

31:33.489 --> 31:35.199
Not without you. You go home!

31:35.200 --> 31:37.791
Gunnar! You go in there, I
am going in there with you!

31:37.792 --> 31:39.955
Somebody in there knows exactly
what's happened to Jason.

31:39.956 --> 31:41.304
And the police will find them.

31:41.305 --> 31:43.115
They won't! They think
he's just another felon!

31:43.116 --> 31:44.598
So what are you gonna do, Gunnar?

31:44.604 --> 31:46.294
When you go in there, what you gonna do?

31:49.084 --> 31:50.118
I don't know.

31:50.827 --> 31:53.670
All right. Let's go.

31:53.741 --> 31:55.864
No, you don't understand. Neither
of you... I do understand!

31:55.865 --> 31:58.402
I know what's it's like to lose
someone like that, all right?

31:58.872 --> 32:01.602
Difference between you and
me is I was responsible.

32:02.935 --> 32:05.335
My best friend Vince... I
made him drive drunk.

32:05.336 --> 32:07.314
He hit a tree. He's gone.

32:08.424 --> 32:09.458
I know...

32:10.552 --> 32:12.115
What you're feeling, man,
'cause I've felt it,

32:12.116 --> 32:14.435
and I hung on to it for years and years.

32:14.436 --> 32:16.303
I wouldn't let it go, and it made me dark,

32:16.304 --> 32:17.959
and it made me lose anything
I ever cared about.

32:17.960 --> 32:20.146
Made me lose the only woman I ever loved.

32:20.568 --> 32:22.642
There ain't nothing for
you inside there, Gunnar.

32:23.591 --> 32:24.314
Let it go, man.

32:24.315 --> 32:25.546
It is some dark crap,

32:25.547 --> 32:26.696
and there's nothing there for you.

32:26.697 --> 32:28.179
You wanna hang on to something?

32:31.466 --> 32:32.692
Hang on her.

32:38.329 --> 32:39.396
Come on.

33:03.354 --> 33:05.996
What are you doing here? I...
know it's your week.

33:05.997 --> 33:08.508
I was just hoping to get a
few moments with Maddie.

33:08.509 --> 33:10.651
She's fine, Rayna. I know she's fine.

33:10.652 --> 33:13.702
I know you're taking
good care of her. Right.

33:13.723 --> 33:15.094
I do, really.

33:15.196 --> 33:18.052
You know, honestly, when we were
in that hospital room today,

33:18.053 --> 33:20.387
I kept remembering back to that room

33:20.388 --> 33:22.510
that we were in when she was born.

33:23.077 --> 33:24.878
It was just us, you know?

33:25.732 --> 33:28.547
You and me and her and us.

33:28.809 --> 33:30.243
She has two parents,

33:32.232 --> 33:33.586
and she needs us.

33:33.593 --> 33:35.354
I wish you'd just let me talk to her.

33:35.355 --> 33:37.540
Just do it for her, if not for me.

33:42.458 --> 33:43.461
Okay.

33:46.010 --> 33:47.060
Thanks.

34:04.794 --> 34:05.876
I'm sorry.

34:06.970 --> 34:09.076
Sorry for blowing the showcase and...

34:10.585 --> 34:12.924
For scaring you. I'll make it up to you.

34:12.925 --> 34:14.279
N-no. It's...

34:16.842 --> 34:18.359
Last night was a mistake.

34:19.659 --> 34:20.710
Sorry.

34:25.920 --> 34:26.922
Yeah.

34:47.840 --> 34:49.148
I thought it was dad's week.

34:49.149 --> 34:51.792
Just wanted to make sure you
know I'm here for you, too.

34:51.893 --> 34:54.225
And... I brought you something.

34:59.093 --> 35:00.544
It's pretty banged up.

35:00.549 --> 35:05.504
This is the first guitar
I ever tried to play.

35:07.408 --> 35:08.783
My mom gave it to me,

35:08.784 --> 35:10.154
and now it's yours.

35:12.896 --> 35:14.651
Honey, I know you're hurtin'.

35:15.713 --> 35:17.493
But the one thing you have
to know through all this

35:17.494 --> 35:20.484
is that I love you, and your dad loves you.

35:20.485 --> 35:22.815
And you have to always know that.

35:24.324 --> 35:25.896
And I know you're gonna need an outlet

35:25.897 --> 35:28.035
for all you're going through.

35:28.889 --> 35:31.667
So I thought maybe you could
channel that through your music.

35:37.050 --> 35:38.259
Thank you.

35:44.857 --> 35:47.907
Oh, and, honey, you're probably
grounded for life. Mm.

35:50.582 --> 35:51.495
Xxx

35:51.496 --> 35:52.447
All right, folks,

35:52.448 --> 35:55.276
we got one final songwriter
for you guys tonight.

35:55.277 --> 35:58.566
Uh, please welcome to the

You've been reading a lot lately

38:29.352 --> 38:30.708
about my next guest.

38:30.709 --> 38:34.172
Please welcome to our
show... Ms. Rayna James.

38:40.858 --> 38:43.117
Xx

38:46.209 --> 38:48.967
- So great to see you. How are you, Rayna?
- Oh, so great to be here.

38:48.968 --> 38:50.968
Oh, so great to be here.

38:48.968 --> 38:50.389
I'm wonderful. Thank you.

38:50.390 --> 38:52.632
You look beautiful as always, and I know...
and so do you.

38:52.633 --> 38:55.242
You have been so busy. You've
been working on a new album.

38:55.243 --> 38:58.521
You've been on a-a major
tour with Juliette Barnes.

38:58.522 --> 39:02.758
Xx

38:58.522 --> 38:59.405
Are you having fun?

38:59.406 --> 39:00.979
Are you completely exhausted?

39:00.980 --> 39:02.783
Oh, it... it is a lot.

39:02.784 --> 39:04.791
I mean, we've been really busy,
but, boy, we've been having

39:04.792 --> 39:06.440
such a good time with this tour,

39:06.441 --> 39:08.311
and it's a great one, and, you know,

39:08.312 --> 39:10.411
since we're in New York, we're
gonna be here next month,

39:10.412 --> 39:12.247
so y'all need to come check us out.

39:13.981 --> 39:17.127
Probably have a lot of
takers with that invitation.

39:18.281 --> 39:21.420
All right, so meanwhile, you
have been doing all of this

39:21.421 --> 39:25.179
in the midst of getting a divorce
from your husband, Teddy Conrad.

39:25.180 --> 39:26.876
That must be very stressful.

39:26.877 --> 39:28.504
Well, you know, it is.

39:28.505 --> 39:29.505
When it comes down

39:29.506 --> 39:31.559
to having something like
that happen in your life,

39:31.560 --> 39:34.302
my experience is no different
from anybody else's.

39:34.303 --> 39:36.081
Xx

39:34.303 --> 39:35.582
You know, the only difference for me

39:35.583 --> 39:38.043
is that I'm having to do it publicly.

39:38.048 --> 39:39.835
Mama, you were right.

39:40.240 --> 39:42.171
You were wearing a green sweater...

39:43.680 --> 39:44.371
With polka dots...

39:44.372 --> 39:46.926
the one I got you for
Christmas when I was 12.

39:48.628 --> 39:50.030
I did see you,

39:50.900 --> 39:52.702
and I was embarrassed.

39:54.436 --> 39:55.998
So I ignored you.

39:57.620 --> 39:58.927
And I'm sorry.

40:01.461 --> 40:03.123
Uh, I was thinking that

40:03.124 --> 40:05.230
I'm going back out on the road soon,

40:06.436 --> 40:08.606
and... you might consider coming with?

40:09.651 --> 40:10.766
Both of you.

40:11.732 --> 40:13.981
You could be her sober companion

40:14.564 --> 40:16.622
or traveling shrink, whatever.

40:18.709 --> 40:20.062
Maybe mine, too.

40:24.484 --> 40:25.517
Deal.

40:26.403 --> 40:27.421
Good.

40:29.652 --> 40:30.894
Baby, where you goin'?

40:31.860 --> 40:33.038
Hospital.

40:33.796 --> 40:34.824
I wanna pay the medical bills

40:34.825 --> 40:37.060
for everybody who got hurt at my show.

40:47.354 --> 40:49.155
Hey. Oh, hey.

40:49.997 --> 40:53.755
Is everything okay with your...
nameless dog?

40:53.756 --> 40:55.143
Yeah, yeah, he's, uh...

40:55.852 --> 40:56.467
He's doing good.

40:56.468 --> 40:58.127
He's a puppy.

40:58.564 --> 41:00.558
So, uh, oh, sue.

41:01.189 --> 41:03.684
What? Uh, sue. I named him sue.

41:03.685 --> 41:04.878
But he's a boy.

41:05.828 --> 41:06.973
Named sue.

41:08.676 --> 41:09.982
You know, like the song.

41:10.548 --> 41:11.534
Johnny...

41:12.260 --> 41:14.647
Wow, you really don't like
country music, do you?

41:14.648 --> 41:16.803
No, yeah, kinda hate it, remember?

41:16.804 --> 41:18.871
Yeah. It's just beer and
broken hearts, so...

41:18.872 --> 41:20.724
You came all the way here just to tell me

41:20.725 --> 41:22.990
that you named your dog?

41:24.244 --> 41:26.191
Yep. Nope.

41:26.505 --> 41:27.428
No.

41:27.800 --> 41:29.251
Um, I just...

41:29.322 --> 41:31.208
I wanted to ask you out on another date.

41:31.209 --> 41:32.819
Not another... a date.

41:32.820 --> 41:35.107
Like a real date. Proper date.

41:35.108 --> 41:37.224
You know, like a dinner, movie.

41:37.225 --> 41:39.466
We can go to a concert, anything you want.

41:40.554 --> 41:41.667
Dog park.

41:46.154 --> 41:47.188
What do you say?

41:47.530 --> 41:49.364
I think I'd like that.

41:49.514 --> 41:50.692
Yeah? Mm-hmm.

41:51.545 --> 41:52.468
Okay.

41:54.297 --> 41:55.300
When?

42:18.538 --> 42:19.184
Hello?

42:19.185 --> 42:20.768
Scarlett? Yeah.

42:20.769 --> 42:22.183
Bucky Dawes. Wanted to tell you

42:22.184 --> 42:24.387
how impressed Rayna was
with your performance.

42:25.064 --> 42:26.019
Really?

42:26.056 --> 42:29.122
She'd like to sign you as a
solo artist to her label.

42:30.520 --> 42:31.322
What?

42:31.323 --> 42:32.863
We're gonna circle back
to you with the details,

42:32.864 --> 42:34.170
but in the meantime,

42:34.480 --> 42:36.090
welcome to the family.

42:36.176 --> 42:38.091
You just got yourself a record deal.
