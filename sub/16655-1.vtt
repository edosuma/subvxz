31:52.125 --> 31:54.298
you were doing your whole

31:54.417 --> 31:56.135
and that's fine - we all make
mistakes.

31:56.250 --> 31:59.459
But here's where we learn
from that mistake.

31:59.583 --> 32:03.338
Country and western music is
about loss.

32:03.458 --> 32:06.302
Soul music is also about loss.

32:06.417 --> 32:09.170
But the difference is,
in country and western music,

32:09.292 --> 32:13.422
they've lost, they've given up and they're
just at home whining about it.

32:13.542 --> 32:15.169
In soul music,

32:15.292 --> 32:16.760
they're struggling to get it back

32:16.875 --> 32:18.343
and they haven't given up,

32:18.458 --> 32:20.881
so every note
that passes through your lips

32:21.000 --> 32:23.549
should have the tone of a woman
who's grasping and fighting

32:23.667 --> 32:26.295
and desperate to retrieve
what's been taken from her.

32:26.417 --> 32:28.260

Myron Ritchie. Your promoter.

40:33.333 --> 40:35.802
Welcome, Sapphires.
Welcome to Saigon.

40:35.917 --> 40:39.376
I'm trusting you'll regard the La Parisian
as your home away from home

40:39.500 --> 40:40.797
all the while you're here in Vietnam.

40:40.917 --> 40:42.339
Is this where we're staying?

40:42.458 --> 40:44.426
Nothing but the best for our stars,
baby.

40:44.542 --> 40:48.718
OK, uh, Myron, um,
are you the man we talk to about money

40:48.833 --> 40:52.133
because, um, if we don't get
the bucks, these stars don't shine.

40:52.250 --> 40:53.627
- Gail.
- Hey!

40:53.750 --> 40:56.503
Myron. Dave Lovelace.

40:56.625 --> 40:58.878
Great to meet you.
I'm the manager of the Sapphires.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.174
These girls are ball-busting good.
Man, this is going to be great.

41:02.292 --> 41:04.090
Food and accommodation
have all been taken care of, ma'am.

41:04.208 --> 41:06.802
And I think you'll find you gals
won't need much cash on the road.

41:06.917 --> 41:10.876
But in the meantime, why don't you
girls check in - have a look around

41:11.000 --> 41:14.584
while I talk turkey with Ringo Starr
and big sister here.

41:14.708 --> 41:16.005
Plenty to see.

41:16.125 --> 41:17.843
- Ladies.
- Plenty.

41:22.250 --> 41:23.718
It goes without saying,

41:23.833 --> 41:25.961
reports on the Sapphires
have been excellent.

41:27.292 --> 41:28.839
And I've got to tell you,
I'm really looking forward

41:28.958 --> 41:32.007
to seeing you sweethearts showcase
your talent on stage tonight.

41:32.125 --> 41:33.422
Tonight?

41:33.542 --> 41:34.919
Well, listen up, honey.

41:35.042 --> 41:36.919
I got 32 acts.

41:37.042 --> 41:38.635
Five of them are soul sisters.

41:38.750 --> 41:41.424
If you can't shake your money maker
for the brothers tonight,

41:41.542 --> 41:44.011
you're all on the first plane
back to Austria tomorrow.

41:44.125 --> 41:45.468
Australia.

41:45.583 --> 41:46.960
The first plane.

41:47.083 --> 41:49.552
Fear not, brother Myron.

41:49.667 --> 41:52.386
I know my girls can lay it down.

41:54.375 --> 41:57.379
And, sister, the singing -
it ain't the half of it.

41:57.500 --> 42:00.925
The show - it better be right on.

42:03.250 --> 42:06.299
If the pool's gonna be on the roof,
it's gonna be up this way.

42:06.417 --> 42:08.966
Are you sure we're allowed up here?
Isn't it just for the soldiers?

42:09.083 --> 42:10.300
Yes, Julie.

42:10.417 --> 42:13.216
I can smell where the good-looking
men are from a mile away.

42:13.333 --> 42:15.176
You're over Jimmy Middleton now'?

42:15.292 --> 42:18.136
Don't mention his name.
He's had his go.

42:18.250 --> 42:21.049
He's not getting a second serve
of this coffee-coloured Koori.

42:23.542 --> 42:26.967
He's in Cummeragunja, I'm in Saigon.
I can do what I like.

We're looking for the pool.

42:57.375 --> 42:59.753
You'll find the pool thataways.

43:00.750 --> 43:02.468
OK.

43:04.583 --> 43:06.176

You've been singing with them
right there, sister.

Hey, sis, if you want something,
you've got to go get it.

it was going to be like this.

They let her come home for the

01:16:25.625 --> 01:16:27.377
Maybe you should just
pull it back a bit.

01:16:29.042 --> 01:16:31.795
Nuh. Not with her.

01:16:31.917 --> 01:16:35.217
You've been drinking, Cyn,
and there's too much at stake tonight.

01:16:36.583 --> 01:16:39.086
What are you doing? Sacking me?

<i>- Dave?
- I'll decide.</i>

01:16:43.667 --> 01:16:45.920
I think we should all decide.

01:16:48.125 --> 01:16:51.925
Cyn, we're doing it without ya.

01:16:52.042 --> 01:16:54.465
Right? Decision made.

01:16:57.667 --> 01:16:59.044

01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:06.128
I'll make you proud of me, bub.

Gail? Gail? Hold on one sec.

01:17:15.458 --> 01:17:17.381
I just wanted to say I, uh...

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:19.468
I thought you dealt with that
really well.

01:17:19.583 --> 01:17:22.006
No, I mean it -
you know, it was a tough call

01:17:22.125 --> 01:17:25.174
and you're obviously
getting really good at this.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.254
Gail, the whole marriage thing,
it's probably not as bad as it sounds.

01:17:31.375 --> 01:17:32.752

- I mean it.

like, a house and a wife</i>

01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:43.006
and me not yet 21 and her no lover of
the rock'n'roll and I'm out on the rip.

01:17:43.125 --> 01:17:49.633
It was an unholy alliance but I
probably should have mentioned it.

01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:53.505
<i>- Yeah, you should have.
- Wait, wait, Gail, before you go.</i>

01:17:54.708 --> 01:17:59.384
I wanted to talk to you about
something

01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:01.423
so I wrote it down.

01:18:02.917 --> 01:18:06.751
No, uh, the thing is, Gail...

01:18:09.208 --> 01:18:11.461
I was never good enough.

01:18:13.333 --> 01:18:18.260
I was never good enough
at music and certainly not at life

01:18:18.375 --> 01:18:22.585
and that's a...
that's a hard thing to take...

01:18:25.458 --> 01:18:26.960
because I didn't have a place

01:18:27.083 --> 01:18:31.714
and then I met
these crazy Aboriginal girls

01:18:31.833 --> 01:18:33.801
and one amazing woman

01:18:33.917 --> 01:18:37.296
and I had a place and I liked it.

then I'm an idiot.

with, and often against.

be the same again.
