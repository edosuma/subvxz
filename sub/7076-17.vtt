00:02.965 --> 00:05.083
yet equally important
types of people:

00:05.084 --> 00:07.168
The goofballs that run around
stirring up trouble,

00:07.169 --> 00:10.420
and the eggheads that
make a big deal out of it.

00:10.421 --> 00:12.273
These are their stories.

00:12.274 --> 00:13.625
You'll be better off
without her.

00:13.626 --> 00:16.378
She was perfect.
Warm, smart, beautiful.

00:16.379 --> 00:19.848
I'm never gonna find another
dental hygienist like that.

00:19.849 --> 00:20.949
Well, you should
stop hitting on her.

00:20.950 --> 00:24.052
Hey, she's the one putting
her hands in my mouth.

00:24.053 --> 00:25.053
Hey!

00:25.054 --> 00:27.033
Over here.

00:29.592 --> 00:31.760
Move along,
nothing to see here.

00:31.761 --> 00:33.728
That's the first time those
words have actually been true.

00:33.729 --> 00:35.647
Ms. Edison, when you called me
down here at midnight,

00:35.648 --> 00:37.682
I expected more than a yam.

00:37.683 --> 00:39.317
Specifically since you said,
"There's been a murder."

00:39.318 --> 00:40.568
Our yam was murdered.

00:40.569 --> 00:42.153
If it's any consolation,
she got me here

00:42.154 --> 00:43.738
on a very misleading
text message.

00:43.739 --> 00:45.106
Jeff, technically,
you are about to be screwed

00:45.107 --> 00:46.574
in the biology room
because our final project

00:46.575 --> 00:47.742
has been destroyed.

00:47.743 --> 00:49.527
All right, look,
I'm sorry for your loss.

00:49.528 --> 00:52.330
I know you guys put the work in,
so you'll get a passing grade.

00:52.331 --> 00:53.581
A passing grade?

00:53.582 --> 00:54.999
Like a "C"?

00:55.000 --> 00:57.285
Why don't I just get pregnant
at a bus station?

00:57.286 --> 00:59.403
That was going to be
an A-plus yam.

00:59.404 --> 01:01.072
I can't give an A-plus
to everyone

01:01.073 --> 01:02.740
whose yam falls of a counter.

01:02.741 --> 01:04.592
Somebody did this to us.

01:04.593 --> 01:06.845
In science,
we call that a hypothesis.

01:06.846 --> 01:09.214
You find something
to back it up and we can talk.

01:09.215 --> 01:13.435
<i>Now if you'll excuse me,
I was watching Mama's Family.</i>

01:13.436 --> 01:14.636
What happened?

01:14.637 --> 01:15.937
Our yam was killed.

01:15.938 --> 01:17.255
But Professor Kane says
we can still get an "A"

01:17.256 --> 01:19.140
- if we figure out who did it.
- He did not say that.

01:19.141 --> 01:20.225
He basically did.

01:20.226 --> 01:21.476
You let me handle
the nitty gritty.

01:21.477 --> 01:23.645
In the meantime, I need somebody
to drum up suspects.

01:23.646 --> 01:24.729
I can help you with that.

01:24.730 --> 01:26.698
I watch crime shows
when I'm bored.

01:26.699 --> 01:28.733
You boys, canvas for witnesses,
establish a time frame

01:28.734 --> 01:30.285
and motive and bring
me a suspect.

01:30.286 --> 01:32.120
You've got 48 hours before
the trail runs cold,

01:32.121 --> 01:33.738
so start with the last person
to see that yam alive.

01:33.739 --> 01:36.274
- Yes, ma'am.
- Understood.

01:36.275 --> 01:37.942
It's been a long 15 years.

01:37.943 --> 01:40.462
Looks like it's gonna
be a late night.

01:40.463 --> 01:41.796
How'd we manage
to pull the short straw?

01:41.797 --> 01:43.414
It's not a short straw.

01:43.415 --> 01:45.467
It's a hot potato.

01:45.468 --> 01:49.554
Yeah, well,
looks pretty cold to me.

01:49.555 --> 01:53.124
Cold?
Or dead?

01:53.125 --> 01:55.810
- Survey says...
- We can't both do the zinger.

01:55.811 --> 01:57.295
Sorry.

Okay, okay, five-to-one
on the black guy.

02:38.020 --> 02:39.020
That's offensive.

02:39.021 --> 02:40.021
Fine, six-to-one.

02:40.022 --> 02:41.022
Hello, boys.

02:41.023 --> 02:44.342
Youth! Scatter!

02:44.343 --> 02:47.445
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
slow down, Pierce.

02:47.446 --> 02:49.513
Mind if we ask you
a couple of questions?

02:49.514 --> 02:51.449
Sure, I always say you guys
should ask me more questions.

02:51.450 --> 02:53.117
Did you water our
biology yam last night?

02:53.118 --> 02:54.285
Of course I watered it.

02:54.286 --> 02:55.519
It was my turn, wasn't it?

02:55.520 --> 02:56.821
I hold up my end.

02:56.822 --> 02:59.657
Did you hold it or drop it?

02:59.658 --> 03:01.826
Okay, whoa, I had
nothing to do with that.

03:01.827 --> 03:03.628
I-I couldn't even
get in the room.

03:03.629 --> 03:04.879
Make up your mind, Pierce.

03:04.880 --> 03:05.880
Did you water the yam
or weren't you there?

03:05.881 --> 03:09.500
Okay, I lied about watering it.

03:09.501 --> 03:11.002
I got there too late,
the doors were already locked.

03:11.003 --> 03:12.703
Why were you late?

03:12.704 --> 03:15.206
I... fell asleep
in a sunbeam.

03:15.207 --> 03:16.707
- Likely story.
- Actually it is.

03:16.708 --> 03:18.176
I used to live with him,
it's kind of adorable.

03:18.177 --> 03:19.894
Look, why are you
looking at me for this?

03:19.895 --> 03:21.813
It was my yam too.

03:21.814 --> 03:22.931
You should be talking
to somebody

03:22.932 --> 03:23.932
who would wanna hurt us.

03:23.933 --> 03:25.733
- And who's that?
- Duh-doy!

03:25.734 --> 03:26.911
Todd.

03:28.687 --> 03:31.105
Last night,
I was home by 9:15,

03:31.106 --> 03:33.691
helped Elly with her geography
and then went straight to bed.

03:33.692 --> 03:35.577
Sounds like you keep
a pretty tight schedule.

03:35.578 --> 03:38.079
A valuable side effect
of military service.

03:38.080 --> 03:41.666
In Iraq, keeping
a tight schedule saved lives.

03:41.667 --> 03:43.167
Ah, what happened, Todd?

03:43.168 --> 03:45.286
Cut yourself on an extra sharp
Oscar Wilde play?

03:45.287 --> 03:46.421
Oh, this?
It's a burn.

03:46.422 --> 03:48.089
Home ec class. Muffin.

03:48.090 --> 03:49.123
What kind of muffin?

03:49.124 --> 03:50.408
- Blueberry.
- Why not raisin?

03:50.409 --> 03:52.043
That wasn't the assignment.

03:52.044 --> 03:53.344
You can dance all day, Todd,

03:53.345 --> 03:54.762
but sooner or later,
the music's gonna change.

03:54.763 --> 03:58.516
Look, even if I wanted to hurt
your yam, I couldn't.

03:58.517 --> 04:01.252
I went by the bio room at 8:10
to chart my yam's growth.

04:01.253 --> 04:02.586
The door was already locked.

04:02.587 --> 04:03.771
There's a lot
of that going around.

04:03.772 --> 04:05.356
- Oh, yeah.
- It's true.

04:05.357 --> 04:07.725
I had to take a picture of my
yam through the door.

04:07.726 --> 04:08.776
See?

04:08.777 --> 04:11.646
Your yam was fine when I left.

04:13.682 --> 04:15.450
I transferred or "downloaded"

04:15.451 --> 04:17.267
Todd's photograph
to this computer

04:17.269 --> 04:19.786
and as you'll see, with
a few adjustments, I can make

04:19.788 --> 04:22.624
the entire image...

04:22.625 --> 04:26.044
old west color.

04:26.045 --> 04:27.495
I don't know.
I thought it was cool.

04:27.496 --> 04:28.963
Britta, zoom in there.

04:28.964 --> 04:30.715
There's a clock on the wall.

04:30.716 --> 04:33.084
- Eight plus two times five...
- Ten after 8:00.

04:33.085 --> 04:34.618
I'm gifted in other ways.

04:34.619 --> 04:36.254
That jibes with everyone
else we talked to.

04:36.255 --> 04:38.089
It seems like the classroom door
gets locked at 8:00.

04:38.090 --> 04:39.424
Which means whoever
did the crime...

04:39.425 --> 04:40.975
Got in there before
the doors were locked

04:40.976 --> 04:42.644
and stayed there for hours.

04:42.645 --> 04:43.978
I was gonna say,
"Had a key".

04:43.979 --> 04:45.480
Last year, I came in
after hours a couple of times

04:45.481 --> 04:47.965
to finish a piÃ±ata
for advanced Spanish.

04:47.966 --> 04:50.034
I had to borrow a key
from the front office.

04:50.035 --> 04:51.686
And sign a log.

04:51.687 --> 04:52.770
I can also help.

04:52.771 --> 04:54.355
As a psych major,
I could pr...

04:56.458 --> 04:58.076
Any student can check out
a key as long as they're

04:58.077 --> 05:00.411
currently taking classes
and show school I.D.

05:00.412 --> 05:01.529
The guy we're looking
for had a key

05:01.530 --> 05:02.747
to the bio room Monday night.

05:02.748 --> 05:04.982
Monday night?
Rings a bell.

05:04.983 --> 05:06.868
I'll check the log.

05:06.869 --> 05:09.320
Sorry, this place is a mess.

05:09.321 --> 05:10.922
Is this about your yam?

05:10.923 --> 05:13.324
I heard about that.
It's a damn shame.

05:13.325 --> 05:17.211
- Mine just bloomed yesterday.
- Congratulations.

05:17.212 --> 05:21.632
Ooh, there she is.

05:21.633 --> 05:27.105
Monday night, one biology room
key checked out by...

05:27.106 --> 05:29.107
Magnitude.

05:31.076 --> 05:32.393
So you're saying you
did check out a key,

05:32.394 --> 05:34.228
but it was inside your backpack
when someone stole it

05:34.229 --> 05:36.447
off a table in the library while
you were using the bathroom

05:36.448 --> 05:37.815
and you haven't seen it since.

05:37.816 --> 05:41.352
Pop pop!

05:41.353 --> 05:43.521
Perfect, so now we gotta solve
a robbery too.

05:43.522 --> 05:45.123
Well, whoever did it
likes to steal backpacks

05:45.124 --> 05:46.324
off tables in the library.

05:46.325 --> 05:49.127
Only one way to catch
a dirtbag like that.

05:53.916 --> 05:56.918
Well, time to visit
the restroom.

06:18.390 --> 06:20.724
I found that backpack.

06:20.725 --> 06:23.727
Hey, idiot, guess what.

06:23.728 --> 06:26.364
We don't care about
the backpack.

06:26.365 --> 06:29.333
Dead yam, big deal.

06:29.334 --> 06:30.734
Order some ketchup.

06:30.735 --> 06:32.420
That doesn't make sense.
You don't order ketchup.

06:32.421 --> 06:33.421
It's a condiment!

06:33.422 --> 06:34.905
Troy, Troy, hey, walk it off!

06:34.906 --> 06:36.791
Troy, walk it off!

06:36.792 --> 06:37.959
Sorry, my friend,
he's a bad cop.

06:37.960 --> 06:39.210
- Yeah.
- I'm a good cop.

06:39.211 --> 06:40.428
- Oh, good.
- You can trust me.

06:40.429 --> 06:42.430
Okay, well... hey!

06:42.431 --> 06:43.965
I'm not falling for that.

06:43.966 --> 06:45.933
And you got nothing on me.

06:45.934 --> 06:48.219
And I don't have to stay here,
'cause you're not cops.

06:53.108 --> 06:54.776
He's right.
You're not cops.

06:54.777 --> 06:57.028
I'd say our hands are tied,
but we basically have no hands.

06:57.029 --> 06:58.229
But he's our man though, right?

06:58.230 --> 07:00.198
Well he ain't innocent.

07:00.199 --> 07:01.983
Look, I'll try
to keep him busy.

07:01.984 --> 07:04.402
You guys go to the lab,
see if they figured out

07:04.403 --> 07:05.987
how our yam met its masher.

07:05.988 --> 07:08.656
I can both see and hear you.

07:10.692 --> 07:13.444
The yam's vascular cylinder
is completely disintegrated.

07:13.445 --> 07:15.079
Any possibility
it happened naturally?

07:15.080 --> 07:17.131
Sure, if the gardener's
Joseph Mengele.

07:17.132 --> 07:18.216
Look at the root system.

07:18.217 --> 07:20.134
This level of smushing
is consistent

07:20.135 --> 07:22.786
with someone stepping on the yam
after it was dropped.

07:22.787 --> 07:24.455
So whoever did this was angry.

07:24.456 --> 07:25.623
Hey, I just cut 'em open.

07:25.624 --> 07:27.291
You want motive,
talk to a shrink.

07:27.292 --> 07:31.012
What I can tell you is that for
a raw yam to get it this bad,

07:31.013 --> 07:32.963
you need more than gravity.

07:32.964 --> 07:34.265
You need a boot.

07:37.736 --> 07:39.136
We have to tell Professor Kane.

07:39.137 --> 07:40.488
There's nothing here
to connect to Star-Burns.

07:40.489 --> 07:41.489
He'd have to confess.

07:41.490 --> 07:42.490
Oh, yeah, sure.

07:42.491 --> 07:43.608
Maybe if we ask him nice,

07:43.609 --> 07:44.909
he'll write us
a love letter too.

07:44.910 --> 07:48.646
Well, whoever did do this does
owe you guys a letter.

07:48.647 --> 07:50.648
An "A."

07:52.584 --> 07:56.320
This yam was about to bloom.

07:56.321 --> 07:57.672
Damn.

07:57.673 --> 08:01.292
We named the yam "Pam."

08:01.293 --> 08:02.293
It rhymed.

08:04.624 --> 08:05.711
Even if we could prove

08:05.712 --> 08:07.212
that Star-Burns stole
Magnitude's key,

08:07.213 --> 08:08.213
it's not enough.

08:08.214 --> 08:09.214
But we know Star-Burns
did it.

08:09.215 --> 08:11.550
Keep the change, Garret.

08:11.551 --> 08:13.117
You know what?
Keep the hot dog.

08:13.118 --> 08:14.136
You're telling me
after all this,

08:14.137 --> 08:15.387
our suspect's gonna slip away

08:15.388 --> 08:16.721
on the technicality
that we're not police?

08:16.722 --> 08:18.039
Okay, look,
you don't need authority

08:18.040 --> 08:19.274
to get a confession.

08:19.275 --> 08:21.209
You need leverage.
Something to hold over his head.

08:21.210 --> 08:22.644
- Like what?
- He's Star-Burns.

08:22.645 --> 08:23.728
Break into his locker.

08:23.729 --> 08:25.013
You'll find enough dirt
to bury him.

08:25.014 --> 08:26.765
Jeff, that's not ethical.

08:26.766 --> 08:29.801
Oh, so now you're
finding your softness?

08:29.802 --> 08:30.936
I say do what you have to do.

08:30.937 --> 08:32.303
It's too late
to get compassionate.

08:32.304 --> 08:35.106
We only have time
to get justice.

08:35.107 --> 08:36.775
I really shouldn't
be doing this.

08:36.775 --> 08:38.827
And you're sure you heard
a kitten meowing in here?

08:38.828 --> 08:41.363
Not anymore, so hurry up.

08:42.414 --> 08:44.416
Whoa, Nelly!

08:48.504 --> 08:51.506
Clean up on aisle "busted."

08:54.594 --> 08:56.127
Why do they always r...

08:56.128 --> 08:57.128
Why do they always...

08:57.129 --> 08:58.463
- You go ahead.
- Why do they always run?

08:58.464 --> 09:01.666
There you go.

09:01.667 --> 09:02.684
Move!

09:02.685 --> 09:04.519
Not police business!

09:04.520 --> 09:08.006
Hey, knock much?

09:08.007 --> 09:09.007
- Kiss me!
- What?

09:09.008 --> 09:10.008
I'll explain later.

09:10.009 --> 09:11.175
- No.
- I'll explain later.

09:11.176 --> 09:12.861
The explanation
isn't the issue.

09:12.862 --> 09:14.512
Aah!

09:14.513 --> 09:16.147
Oh, all right, all right.

09:16.148 --> 09:19.317
Look, I-I swiped some
beakers for the meth lab

09:19.318 --> 09:21.319
that I'm building
in the trunk of my car.

09:21.320 --> 09:22.704
But that's it.

09:22.705 --> 09:24.289
I didn't kill any yam.

09:24.290 --> 09:25.707
Tell it
to the biology Professor.

09:25.708 --> 09:26.908
Oh, now wait!

09:26.909 --> 09:28.243
I know who did it.

09:28.244 --> 09:30.361
I left the door open
and someone came in.

09:30.362 --> 09:32.047
He dropped your yam.

09:32.048 --> 09:33.865
Will you tell
our teacher who it was?

09:33.866 --> 09:35.333
If you promise
I won't get in trouble

09:35.334 --> 09:36.885
for stealing that
meth lab stuff.

09:36.886 --> 09:38.369
- Sure, whatever.
- Fine.

09:38.370 --> 09:40.371
Pinky swear?

09:42.642 --> 09:44.709
It was the guy with
the weird head.

09:44.710 --> 09:45.727
The army guy.

09:45.728 --> 09:47.062
I heard the jar break and then

09:47.063 --> 09:49.731
I saw him running out
of the room holding his hand.

09:49.732 --> 09:54.736
Looked like he cut himself.

09:54.737 --> 09:56.938
Well, well, well.

09:56.939 --> 09:57.989
Look at this, Abed.

09:57.990 --> 10:00.058
He weaves baskets and lies.

10:00.059 --> 10:01.059
What's this about?

10:01.060 --> 10:03.061
It's about the killing
of our biology yam.

10:03.062 --> 10:04.246
Will you please come with us?

10:04.247 --> 10:05.697
But I'm in the middle
of making a handle.

10:05.698 --> 10:07.899
He wants it the hard way.
Tell him what Shirley said.

10:07.900 --> 10:10.068
Todd Jacobson, you have the
right to do whatever you want.

10:10.069 --> 10:12.570
Nothing you say or do can be
used against you by anyone,

10:12.571 --> 10:14.039
but we'd really like it
if you came with us.

10:14.040 --> 10:16.141
Please and thank you.

10:17.226 --> 10:18.226
Make it quick, folks.

10:18.227 --> 10:20.912
I have a class in five minutes
and none of you guys are in it.

10:20.913 --> 10:23.081
After conducting
a full investigation,

10:23.082 --> 10:26.184
my study group now has
definitive proof that Todd,

10:26.185 --> 10:28.803
with malice of forethought,
smashed our yam.

10:28.804 --> 10:31.189
That's a serious allegation.
I hope you can back it up.

10:31.190 --> 10:32.924
We can place him
in the building Monday night.

10:32.925 --> 10:35.560
He has a mysterious
bandage on his hand,

10:35.561 --> 10:37.762
and we have and eyewitness who
saw Todd drop the jar and flee.

10:37.763 --> 10:39.263
Well, Todd, what do you
have to say?

10:39.264 --> 10:42.484
- I just wanna...
- Don't answer that, soldier!

10:42.485 --> 10:45.036
- This man is an American hero.
- And who are you?

10:45.037 --> 10:47.739
I'm Lieutenant Colonel Archwood,
United States Army.

10:47.740 --> 10:50.274
I had the pleasure of commanding
this young man in Iraq.

10:50.275 --> 10:51.660
I'm staying on his couch
this weekend

10:51.661 --> 10:53.161
while I'm in town
for a wedding.

10:53.162 --> 10:56.247
I am a licensed attorney,
a veteran of two wars,

10:56.248 --> 11:00.468
and I'd like to know why in hell
he's being harassed.

11:00.469 --> 11:02.787
Mr. Winger,
what is the intention here?

11:02.788 --> 11:06.257
Simple. When Todd smashed our
yam, he stole an "A" from us.

11:06.258 --> 11:07.392
We want it back.

11:07.393 --> 11:09.344
<i>You mean if he smashed the yam.</i>

11:09.345 --> 11:11.646
All you have is the word
of this Mr. Star-Burns,

11:11.647 --> 11:14.432
who offers up no explanation
as to why he was at the scene.

11:14.433 --> 11:15.633
How about it, Jeffrey?

11:15.634 --> 11:17.802
What was Star-Burns
doing there?

11:17.803 --> 11:19.187
We agreed to withhold
that information

11:19.188 --> 11:21.639
as part of a pinky swear
with the witness.

11:21.640 --> 11:22.991
A pinky swear?

11:22.992 --> 11:25.694
This is ludicrous.
This whole school is ludicrous.

11:25.695 --> 11:27.979
Who honors the pinky swear
of a degenerate

11:27.980 --> 11:29.531
over the word
of a decorated soldier?

11:29.532 --> 11:32.167
I'm inclined to agree
with the man in uniform.

11:32.168 --> 11:33.702
- Shocker.
- Jeffrey.

11:33.703 --> 11:36.671
Tell us what Star-Burns
was doing in that classroom,

11:36.672 --> 11:38.823
or your group can take an "F."

11:38.824 --> 11:40.491
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

11:40.492 --> 11:42.127
I grade my students.

11:42.128 --> 11:44.462
Now, what Star-Face was doing
there is irrelevant.

11:44.463 --> 11:46.297
What matters is what he saw.

11:46.298 --> 11:47.799
I'm upholding the pinky swear.

11:47.800 --> 11:49.000
What?

11:49.001 --> 11:51.269
Yo, man, you spent
your life in the army.

11:51.270 --> 11:52.887
I spent mine in prison.

11:52.888 --> 11:56.274
Two places where a man's word
is only as good as his uniform.

11:56.275 --> 11:58.443
Now out here,
it's supposed to be different.

11:58.444 --> 12:00.862
And in my class, it will be.

12:00.863 --> 12:02.447
You two can plead
your case to the class

12:02.448 --> 12:05.784
and let them
decide your grades.

12:05.785 --> 12:08.570
Professor...
Thank you.

12:08.571 --> 12:10.955
It's not a favor,
Mr. Winger.

12:10.956 --> 12:12.240
A man's gotta have a code.

12:12.241 --> 12:14.025
Awesome.

12:14.026 --> 12:16.411
See you in class.

12:20.833 --> 12:22.250
- Uniform.
- Oh!

12:22.251 --> 12:23.251
Jeez.

12:23.252 --> 12:25.253
Yeah.

12:25.254 --> 12:26.588
Shirley did some more digging.

12:26.589 --> 12:28.740
Turns out Todd's yam
never even sprouted.

12:28.741 --> 12:30.058
Goes to motive.

12:30.059 --> 12:32.927
And Star-Burns puts Todd
in the classroom at 8:10.

12:32.928 --> 12:33.928
Opportunity.

12:33.929 --> 12:35.230
Add to that a cut on the hand

12:35.231 --> 12:38.099
and the Winger charm,
we might get an A-plus-plus.

12:38.100 --> 12:39.350
We still have
a lot of work to do.

12:39.351 --> 12:40.935
Oh, I think you've done enough.

12:40.936 --> 12:42.720
Colonel Archwood
got to Star-Burns.

12:42.721 --> 12:44.222
Threatened to involve
the real cops.

12:44.223 --> 12:46.891
Now Star-Burns is in the wind.

12:46.892 --> 12:48.493
He's our only witness.

12:48.494 --> 12:49.494
That what you guys do in here?

12:49.495 --> 12:50.495
You push your little papers

12:50.496 --> 12:51.830
and you make your
little speeches,

12:51.831 --> 12:53.564
and in the end another
dirtbag walks?

12:53.565 --> 12:55.867
Huh?
Huh?!

12:55.868 --> 12:58.002
Abed! Abed!

12:58.003 --> 12:59.904
Abed! Walk it off!

12:59.905 --> 13:02.507
Walk it off!

13:02.508 --> 13:04.292
I'm sorry about my partner.

13:04.293 --> 13:09.914
He... he's been on edge
ever since we switched.

13:09.915 --> 13:12.100
You.

13:12.101 --> 13:14.418
Annie, that class
already hates us.

13:14.419 --> 13:16.521
If we go in there without
a case, they'll fail us.

13:16.522 --> 13:18.189
We have proof
our yam was murdered

13:18.190 --> 13:19.941
and now you find your softness?

13:19.942 --> 13:22.093
It's eat or be eaten
when that's convenient,

13:22.094 --> 13:24.446
but when the going gets tough,
Winger gets nervous, huh?

13:24.447 --> 13:26.114
We have no case, Annie.

13:26.115 --> 13:27.949
It's too late to get one, Jeff.

13:27.950 --> 13:30.682
We only have time
to get justice.

13:35.166 --> 13:37.265
Tell us what happened next,
Todd.

13:37.266 --> 13:39.568
I disarmed the I.E.D.

13:39.569 --> 13:41.820
and returned the child
to his mother.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.990
She offered to give me her only
possession... a wooden chair...

13:44.991 --> 13:46.208
but I refused.

13:46.209 --> 13:49.277
I was only doing my duty
and we had

13:49.278 --> 13:50.996
plenty of chairs at the base.

13:50.997 --> 13:53.164
And for your valor,
you were awarded a bronze star.

13:53.165 --> 13:55.717
In fact, you have an absolutely
glowing service record.

13:55.718 --> 13:57.586
- Don't you, private?
- I do my best.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.921
You do more than that, soldier.

13:59.922 --> 14:02.224
Certainly more
than this witness

14:02.225 --> 14:03.791
who supposedly saw you
kill the yam.

14:03.792 --> 14:06.177
A man who for all we know

14:06.178 --> 14:08.430
is a holocaust-denying,
9/11 pedophile.

14:08.431 --> 14:10.982
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

14:10.983 --> 14:12.267
One last question.

14:12.268 --> 14:14.102
Did you intentionally
break into

14:14.103 --> 14:16.571
the biology room
with the express purpose

14:16.572 --> 14:18.973
of killing
the study group's yam?

14:18.974 --> 14:21.243
- No, sir, I did not.
- Thank you, soldier.

14:21.244 --> 14:25.030
And God bless your testimony.

14:25.031 --> 14:27.032
Your witness.

14:29.585 --> 14:33.421
Tell me, Todd, do you
consider yourself a hero?

14:33.422 --> 14:34.456
Oh, no.

14:34.457 --> 14:35.507
Of course not.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.742
A hero doesn't call
himself a hero.

14:37.743 --> 14:40.128
A hero gets called a hero
because of what he does.

14:40.129 --> 14:41.379
And with your
impressive record,

14:41.380 --> 14:42.797
not even I could
deny you the title.

14:42.798 --> 14:45.133
Objection, she's clearly
ramping up to something.

14:45.134 --> 14:46.718
Objection, that's not
a real objection.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.520
Objection, I hate
the both of you.

14:48.521 --> 14:50.956
You may proceed, Ms. Edison,
but do so with caution.

14:50.957 --> 14:53.441
Need I remind you
this is not a courtroom?

14:53.442 --> 14:55.143
I spent the majority
of last night

14:55.144 --> 14:56.561
going over your records
with Mr. Winger,

14:56.562 --> 15:01.032
scouring them for the slightest
mistake, the tiniest slip up.

15:01.033 --> 15:04.452
And I gotta tell you, Todd.
Couldn't find a thing.

15:04.453 --> 15:07.405
Not one little smudge.

15:07.406 --> 15:12.193
Except, of course, for one pesky
yam that just wouldn't grow.

15:12.194 --> 15:14.079
That had to weigh on your soul,
didn't it, Todd?

15:14.080 --> 15:16.197
- Maybe a little.
- A little?

15:16.198 --> 15:19.968
A big orange splotch
on your perfect record?

15:19.969 --> 15:22.337
I bet that pissed you
right off, didn't it?

15:22.338 --> 15:23.922
Is that why you hit your wife?

15:23.923 --> 15:25.390
Withdrawn.

15:25.391 --> 15:26.841
Is that why you drink
and pop pills?

15:26.842 --> 15:27.842
Withdrawn.

15:27.843 --> 15:29.427
Are you a virgin?
Withdrawn.

15:29.428 --> 15:30.726
Did you...

15:32.348 --> 15:35.900
kill our yam to settle
the score, huh?

15:35.901 --> 15:38.886
Did stomping on its roots
make you feel like a big man?

15:38.887 --> 15:40.071
No, it didn't.

15:40.072 --> 15:41.556
I mean, I didn't...

15:41.557 --> 15:43.224
Todd, zip it.

15:43.225 --> 15:45.777
No, you zip it,
Uncle Knobby.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.696
I'm not fighting
your wars anymore.

15:47.697 --> 15:49.030
Listen to me, Todd.

15:49.031 --> 15:52.367
I know how scary
a failing grade can be,

15:52.368 --> 15:55.236
but this one dead yam
won't tarnish your record.

15:55.237 --> 15:59.574
What will tarnish it
is lying to your class,

15:59.575 --> 16:01.292
to your teacher, and to me.

16:01.293 --> 16:04.078
The American citizen
you've sworn to protect.

16:04.079 --> 16:06.748
Come on, Todd.

16:06.749 --> 16:08.800
Stop disappointing me.

16:08.801 --> 16:12.587
Defuse the I.E.D.
of dishonesty.

16:15.018 --> 16:16.307
It was an accident.

16:17.360 --> 16:19.060
I just wanted
to look at your yam,

16:19.061 --> 16:22.697
but when I picked up the jar,
it burnt me and I dropped it.

16:22.698 --> 16:24.649
Booyah!

16:24.650 --> 16:27.736
That's how it's done!

16:27.737 --> 16:31.239
âª Ooh, ooh, ooh,
ah, ah, ah, ah âª

16:31.240 --> 16:34.125
- Todd...
- Woo-hoo!

16:34.126 --> 16:35.377
I'm telling your mother.

16:35.378 --> 16:36.461
That's right.

16:36.462 --> 16:39.781
Always have an exit strategy.

16:42.051 --> 16:44.452
I think I've heard enough.

16:44.453 --> 16:47.455
Professor Kane, may we have
a sidebar in your office?

16:51.343 --> 16:52.627
I want a mistrial.

16:52.628 --> 16:54.429
Just give us a "C,"
give Todd a "C."

16:54.430 --> 16:56.130
- Excuse me?
- What?

16:56.131 --> 16:59.067
Can we take a sidebar
in this sidebar?

16:59.068 --> 17:01.352
Jeff, we're about
to get our "A."

17:01.353 --> 17:03.971
- Todd didn't do it.
- Um, he just confessed, dummy.

17:03.972 --> 17:05.940
He said the jar burned him?

17:05.941 --> 17:07.075
It doesn't make any sense.

17:07.076 --> 17:08.742
People don't half-confess
to crimes.

17:08.743 --> 17:11.813
Look, when we started this,
you were after the truth.

17:11.814 --> 17:15.316
And then I convinced you
it was more important to win.

17:15.317 --> 17:17.252
Don't be like me.

17:17.252 --> 17:19.153
A man's got to have a code.

17:19.154 --> 17:22.507
I can only assume there is
a female equivalent to that.

17:22.508 --> 17:24.592
- A "codette" or something.
- But...

17:24.593 --> 17:26.211
It's not worth getting an "A"

17:26.212 --> 17:29.214
if an innocent man
might get an "F."

17:31.217 --> 17:33.268
Okay, I heard
all of that and I accept.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.138
All right.

17:37.139 --> 17:40.859
After speaking to the wronged
parties, I've decided to...

17:40.860 --> 17:43.394
Uh, if it pleases
the bio class,

17:43.395 --> 17:44.896
I have closing arguments.

17:44.897 --> 17:47.315
Of course you do.

17:47.316 --> 17:52.954
Why was it so hard
for all of us to grow a yam?

17:52.955 --> 17:57.242
It's just a stupid yam
in a stupid jar.

17:57.243 --> 18:01.696
We're all fully-grown adults
failing a kindergarten project.

18:01.697 --> 18:03.531
- Can I object?
- I'll allow it.

18:03.532 --> 18:04.549
Sustained.

18:04.550 --> 18:07.535
And all this time we assumed
our yam was targeted,

18:07.536 --> 18:10.755
that someone had stomped
its roots maliciously.

18:10.756 --> 18:13.708
But what if...
what if our yam's roots

18:13.709 --> 18:16.544
were dead before
they hit the ground?

18:18.264 --> 18:19.597
- Hey, that's mine!
- Look at it.

18:19.598 --> 18:20.932
Everyone look.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.601
Smushed without
being stepped on.

18:24.820 --> 18:26.321
Because it didn't
have to be stepped on.

18:26.322 --> 18:29.023
Because it was boiled.

18:29.024 --> 18:33.611
Someone has been pouring boiling
water into our jars at night.

18:33.612 --> 18:36.564
No one noticed because the water
cooled off by morning.

18:36.565 --> 18:40.285
Boiling water is the icicle
stabbing of yam killing.

18:42.204 --> 18:43.621
Ooh, but that didn't...

18:43.622 --> 18:45.623
Hmm.

18:45.624 --> 18:47.909
This yam isn't boiled.

18:47.910 --> 18:49.043
Vicki?

18:49.044 --> 18:51.296
I don't... I didn't
do it, I swear!

18:51.297 --> 18:52.297
I boiled the yams.

18:52.298 --> 18:54.182
Vicki's yam never sprouted

18:54.183 --> 18:56.217
and I didn't want her to fail,
so I threw off the grading curve

18:56.218 --> 18:57.635
so she wouldn't have
to go to summer school

18:57.636 --> 19:00.755
and we can finally have
sex in my parents' cabin.

19:00.756 --> 19:02.056
God forgive me,
I did it for love!

19:02.057 --> 19:05.927
Holy crap.

19:05.928 --> 19:09.230
We are definitely dissecting
pine cones next year.

19:09.231 --> 19:12.600
Neil has agreed to retake
biology over the summer

19:12.601 --> 19:15.269
and his status as
keymaster has been revoked.

19:15.270 --> 19:17.939
After all the politics
and procedure, in the end,

19:17.940 --> 19:20.074
the case really
was about biology.

19:20.075 --> 19:22.377
Told you it was
an important subject.

19:24.713 --> 19:26.714
Hello?

19:31.554 --> 19:36.474
I understand.

19:36.475 --> 19:38.426
Star-Burns got rear-ended

19:38.427 --> 19:42.146
and the meth lab
in his trunk exploded.

19:42.147 --> 19:44.148
He's dead.

19:50.538 --> 19:53.189
- Abed?
- Yeah?

19:53.190 --> 19:55.141
Why don't we have
bunk bed conversations?

19:55.142 --> 19:56.809
I don't know.

19:56.810 --> 19:58.911
We're best friends,
we share a bunk bed.

19:58.912 --> 20:00.613
Seems like we should be
having them all the time.

20:00.614 --> 20:01.914
You start.

20:01.915 --> 20:05.134
Okay. Why do you think
they call them "bunk beds"?

20:05.135 --> 20:06.903
Where's the word "bunk"
come from?

20:06.904 --> 20:07.937
I don't know.

20:07.938 --> 20:10.238
I think it comes
from the word "bunker."

20:10.239 --> 20:13.676
So when is your apartment
done being fumigated?

20:13.677 --> 20:15.111
Oh, it was done
about a week ago.

20:15.112 --> 20:16.496
Then why are you still here?

20:16.497 --> 20:19.849
- I brought you some warm milk.
- Oh.

20:19.850 --> 20:21.298
There you go.

20:21.299 --> 20:25.154
âª Troy and Abed,
off to Dreamland âª

20:25.155 --> 20:29.225
âª catching the train
to Sleepytown âª

20:29.226 --> 20:30.259
âª and when they wake up âª

20:30.260 --> 20:32.161
âª the Dean'll be here âª

20:32.162 --> 20:34.797
âª staring at you âª

20:34.798 --> 20:36.616
Sweet deans.

20:36.617 --> 20:39.402
That's nice... I guess.

20:40.305 --> 20:46.301
