[indistinct snoring]

01:20.291 --> 01:22.877
[McCullough] Let's go, Diaz.
It's time.

01:22.960 --> 01:24.920
Party bus is leaving.

01:28.633 --> 01:31.927
[Aleida] I left you my nail polish kit.

01:32.011 --> 01:33.471
Twelve colors...

01:33.554 --> 01:36.391
and none of them
got melted Skittles mixed in.

01:36.474 --> 01:38.017
Nails are more your thing.

01:38.100 --> 01:40.436
So? You ain't gotta do nails.

01:40.520 --> 01:42.021
Paint little pictures...

01:42.104 --> 01:44.524
or decorate a vase or some shit.
I don't know.

01:44.607 --> 01:46.526
Aren't you supposed
to be the creative one?

01:46.609 --> 01:48.403
All right. Thanks.

01:49.404 --> 01:51.697
And for you,
I left all my thermals and my good hat.

01:52.782 --> 01:55.993
You don't want to take that?
It gets cold in the Bronx too.

01:57.245 --> 01:59.914
It's itchy.
Plus it got bird shit on it.

02:00.373 --> 02:02.082
[door rattling]

02:03.083 --> 02:05.461
Can I get someone down to processing?
Door's locked.

02:05.545 --> 02:06.879
[Gloria] Seriously?

02:10.966 --> 02:16.222
Last week, we released
this other Hispanic girl at midnight.

02:16.306 --> 02:19.767
She didn't have a ride, so she was just
walking on the side of the road.

02:19.850 --> 02:21.227
I guess she was trying to hitchhike,

02:21.311 --> 02:24.189
but a townie thought she was a prostitute
and called the cops.

02:25.231 --> 02:26.274
And?

02:26.357 --> 02:28.651
She got picked up.
Brought right back to prison.

02:28.734 --> 02:30.236
Or jail, actually.

02:30.320 --> 02:33.448
-[Aleida sighs]
-Started in prison, ended in jail.

02:33.531 --> 02:34.990
[chuckles]

02:35.074 --> 02:37.618
[Gloria] You don't got another story
you could tell her today?

02:37.702 --> 02:40.496
-[indistinct walkie-talkie chatter]
-[footsteps approaching]

02:43.916 --> 02:46.669
Shit. This is it.

02:48.213 --> 02:49.214
Come on.

02:50.215 --> 02:51.257
Stay focused.

02:52.300 --> 02:55.595
Buy yourself a good pair of shoes,
and get to work.

02:55.678 --> 02:56.887
You got this.

02:56.971 --> 02:58.348
[blows kisses]

03:01.309 --> 03:02.810
Okay.
[laughs]

03:02.893 --> 03:07.022
All right, I'm not dying.
Come on, dry it up.

03:07.106 --> 03:09.275
Come on, come on.
[sniffles]

03:09.359 --> 03:13.153
This is how you want me to remember you?
Huh? Hmm?

03:17.157 --> 03:18.826
Shit, I got something for you.

03:18.909 --> 03:21.120
It's back in my bunk.
Is there time to go get it?

03:21.203 --> 03:24.081
Oh, you can put it in the mail.
Everyone likes getting mail.

03:24.164 --> 03:26.208
I have a pen pal in Guam.

03:26.959 --> 03:29.545
-You have an address, right?
-'Course I do.

03:35.968 --> 03:39.472
All right, bitches.
I'm out.

03:39.555 --> 03:40.556
[Gloria chuckles]

03:42.016 --> 03:43.142
[Aleida blows kiss]

[door closes]

03:45.686 --> 03:47.438
[indistinct chatter]

04:02.495 --> 04:04.455
Eyes open, inmate.

04:04.539 --> 04:06.040
This look like a bed to you?

04:06.123 --> 04:08.293
I'm up, ogre man.

04:08.376 --> 04:11.629
You are on this table
till you physically cannot stand.

04:11.712 --> 04:13.172
Good.

04:13.256 --> 04:15.925
I'm going for the world record
so I can be in that book.

04:16.926 --> 04:20.220
Usually, it's the short ones
that need to act like that.

04:20.305 --> 04:21.514
Piscatella!

04:21.596 --> 04:23.683
He's practically a building.

04:23.766 --> 04:26.769
So you tell me
what he's compensating for.

04:26.852 --> 04:28.438
Must be a button down there.

04:30.523 --> 04:32.442
I thought she'd buckle
after a couple hours,

04:32.525 --> 04:33.693
not two whole days.

04:33.776 --> 04:35.611
Don't apologize.

04:35.695 --> 04:37.988
You made a tough call,
and now we all got your back.

04:38.072 --> 04:39.615
That's how the brotherhood works.

04:39.699 --> 04:42.535
We can't take her down?
She pissed herself twice already.

04:42.618 --> 04:44.620
It's a game of chicken, she'll break.

04:44.704 --> 04:46.664
And Caputo's cool with all this, right?

04:46.747 --> 04:48.248
Don't worry about Caputo.

04:48.333 --> 04:51.294
If he wants to leave that oak desk of his
and join us here in the trenches,

04:51.377 --> 04:52.670
he knows where to find us.

04:53.588 --> 04:56.006
Back to it. [clears throat]

04:56.090 --> 04:58.258
You got this, Flores.

04:58.343 --> 05:01.387
Just like that poster kitten
or Jesus on the cross.

05:01.471 --> 05:02.805
You hang in there.

05:04.139 --> 05:07.768
Like Jesus ever went around slinging drugs
and rubbing fish sauce on himself.

05:07.852 --> 05:09.937
-[inmate laughs]
-And he was white.

05:10.020 --> 05:11.271
Wasn't he Middle Eastern?

05:11.356 --> 05:13.566
No... he was just really tan.

05:18.863 --> 05:21.031
[all exclaiming and laughing]

05:23.576 --> 05:26.036
-[inmates snickering]
-[chuckling] Gross.

05:26.120 --> 05:27.788
Enjoy. [laughs]

05:30.165 --> 05:31.709
I've created a monster.

05:31.792 --> 05:33.878
You didn't create white hate.

05:33.961 --> 05:35.630
But I gathered the haters together.

05:35.713 --> 05:38.549
And then I angled them towards
the Dominicans.

05:38.633 --> 05:39.884
This Flores shit is medieval,

05:39.967 --> 05:41.927
and she's right,
they are targeting Dominicans.

05:42.011 --> 05:44.221
Oh, you mean the people
who branded you?

05:46.641 --> 05:47.642
Ugh.

05:49.309 --> 05:51.729
-Now that it's a window, I kinda like it.
-It's not a window.

05:52.938 --> 05:55.065
It's a reminder to stay out
of other people's shit.

05:55.149 --> 05:59.319
This is not other people's shit.
This is all of our shit.

05:59.404 --> 06:02.615
This prison is turning into some kind of
grotesque social experiment.

06:02.698 --> 06:04.617
I'm gonna talk to Piscatella.

06:04.700 --> 06:05.826
He likes me.

06:07.870 --> 06:08.871
He's semi-reasonable.

06:08.954 --> 06:14.585
Next person who hands Flores a beverage
is crawling back to her bunk.

06:14.669 --> 06:16.629
Let this be a lesson.

06:17.171 --> 06:20.215
Flores is not a martyr, people.

06:20.299 --> 06:23.343
She is a regular, normal, criminal.

06:24.554 --> 06:26.263
[inmate] Like the rest of us, right?

06:26.346 --> 06:29.141
Yeah, that's... so reasonable.

06:32.269 --> 06:33.854
[car approaching]

06:51.246 --> 06:52.247
You're late.

06:53.207 --> 06:55.000
Uh, you're welcome.

06:56.126 --> 06:57.336
[CO] Diaz, right?

06:58.378 --> 06:59.755
Yeah, why?

07:00.756 --> 07:02.216
From your kid.

07:02.299 --> 07:04.384
[indistinct chatter on car radio]

07:04.469 --> 07:05.470
Thanks.

07:05.553 --> 07:07.096
[woman 1 on radio]
<i>...wrong with those Republicans?</i>

07:07.179 --> 07:09.223
[woman 2 on radio] <i>Your nearby</i>

07:09.306 --> 07:11.391

07:14.854 --> 07:16.313

[pop song playing on radio]

07:17.940 --> 07:21.527
Cesar says to tell you hi.
And to not act like a bitch.

07:27.908 --> 07:30.119
Let's go, it's exercise time.

07:34.331 --> 07:36.667
[indistinct walkie-talkie chatter]

07:41.547 --> 07:43.466
-Sophia?
-[inmates shouting faintly]

07:44.675 --> 07:46.552
Sophia?

07:47.512 --> 07:49.138
It's a nervous tick.

07:50.973 --> 07:52.307
[CO sighs]

07:52.391 --> 07:53.433
Sophia.

07:53.518 --> 07:54.769
Come on, speed it up, inmate.

07:54.852 --> 07:56.896
I'm sorry, I have plantar fasciitis.

08:00.315 --> 08:02.568
[Sophia knocks on cell] Sister...
is that you?

08:02.652 --> 08:06.238
-[gasps] Oh...
-[Sophia coughs] Sister...

08:06.321 --> 08:07.907
[knocking continues]

08:09.199 --> 08:12.119
[indistinct PA chatter]

08:13.538 --> 08:14.539
[Nicky sighs]

08:15.623 --> 08:16.999
I'm here to help.

08:17.917 --> 08:22.046
I even have rubber bands to put
into your big hair for when you puke.

08:22.129 --> 08:25.049
Actually, Red, I got this.

08:25.841 --> 08:28.427
"You got this."
What does that mean?

08:28.511 --> 08:31.221
It means that after our talk,

08:31.305 --> 08:34.517
I took a hard look at how pathetic
my life had become,

08:34.600 --> 08:36.519
and decided to just go cold turkey.

08:37.602 --> 08:40.940
With the help of my friends
Advil and Imodium, of course.

08:41.023 --> 08:44.652
And candy, and, uh, crossword puzzles.

08:44.735 --> 08:49.364
My... my guts and my asshole
are like raw meat.

08:49.448 --> 08:54.203
Uh, my veins are pulsing.
But other than that, man, so far so good.

08:54.286 --> 08:57.372
Oh, and lucky you,
you missed the puke phase,

08:57.456 --> 08:59.333
so you can save those elastics.

08:59.416 --> 09:02.211
What about cravings? Triggers?

09:02.294 --> 09:05.798
This is my seventh time
getting clean intentionally,

09:05.881 --> 09:08.968
and I find that the best way
to avoid shit, is to avoid shit.

09:09.051 --> 09:13.388
So, I'm gonna go to work
and just distract myself with...

09:13.472 --> 09:15.891
good old-fashioned manual labor.

09:15.975 --> 09:17.977
You know, thank you, though.

09:18.853 --> 09:20.270
It means a lot to me.

09:22.815 --> 09:23.816
[clicks tongue]

09:24.734 --> 09:27.236
See? Heigh-ho, heigh-ho.

09:30.447 --> 09:31.949
So your mom got out today?

09:32.950 --> 09:35.369
She's probably sunbathing
on the stoop already, or...

09:35.452 --> 09:36.746
having oysters at Cosenza's.

09:37.371 --> 09:41.792
Well... for what it's worth, I liked her.
Even though she's a bitch.

09:41.876 --> 09:43.335
[both chuckle]

09:43.418 --> 09:47.131
My dad, he's that way too.
He sucks up all the oxygen in the room.

09:47.214 --> 09:49.299
How do you deal with that,
the oxygen thing?

09:49.383 --> 09:50.509
Ran away.

09:50.593 --> 09:51.927
And I got my nipple pierced.

09:52.887 --> 09:56.515
Hmm, I was thinking of shaving my head,
or dying my hair crazy colors.

09:56.599 --> 09:59.393
That's a better idea.
My nipple got infected. [scoffs]

09:59.476 --> 10:00.603
Oh.

10:01.604 --> 10:03.981
[sighs] Feels like
the first day in prison.

10:04.064 --> 10:06.651
Or, like, before doesn't count,
'cause my mom was here.

10:07.818 --> 10:09.612
Now, I'm actually... alone.

10:09.695 --> 10:11.405
[smacks lips] You don't gotta be alone.

10:11.488 --> 10:13.198
You can come hang out
with me and my girls.

10:13.282 --> 10:15.200
[Dayanara] You're in the salon, right?
My mom said.

10:15.284 --> 10:18.328
Oh, yeah. It smells like burnt hair,
but those chairs are comfy.

10:19.413 --> 10:20.580
[Gloria] Hey, Daya.

10:20.665 --> 10:23.167
You wanna come over here and help me
with some bags in the fridge?

10:25.335 --> 10:26.879
Comfy chair sounds nice.

10:26.962 --> 10:28.881
[indistinct PA chatter]

10:32.718 --> 10:34.845
-[indistinct chatter]
-[man laughing]

10:44.229 --> 10:45.648
[bell dinging]

10:45.731 --> 10:47.316
We could still go for oysters.

10:47.399 --> 10:48.818
No, this is fine.

10:48.901 --> 10:51.320
We're close to the highway,
so we'll get back faster.

10:51.403 --> 10:53.530
-Some coffee to start?
-Huh?

10:53.613 --> 10:57.117
-Some coffee?
-Uh, sure.

11:01.872 --> 11:04.750
So... what's the first thing
you're gonna do?

11:04.834 --> 11:06.418
Probably take a shower.

11:06.501 --> 11:08.921
Oh... 'cause y'all had to shower together.

11:09.004 --> 11:12.049
No... we had curtains and stuff.

11:12.925 --> 11:16.887
But you worried you got TB germs,
or, like, Hep C on you?

11:16.971 --> 11:19.890
No, I just... [sighs]

11:20.933 --> 11:23.227
I wanna take a shower.
Feel like myself again.

11:24.061 --> 11:27.773
And then tomorrow, I'm gonna wake up
and try to see all my kids.

11:27.857 --> 11:29.984
Walk across all five boroughs
if I have to.

11:30.776 --> 11:34.529
I'm gonna tell them I'm gonna get them
the fuck out of foster care.

11:34.613 --> 11:36.198
Once I figure out how.

11:40.660 --> 11:43.831
I heard that in prison,
if you got big tits,

11:43.914 --> 11:45.750
you can hide stuff under there.

11:45.833 --> 11:50.004
Like, Botox needles.
Pills that don't melt too easy.

11:50.087 --> 11:52.631
You get some kind of big tit newsletter?

11:52.714 --> 11:55.926
My cousin Trina got let out last month.

11:56.010 --> 11:58.262
We took her to City Island
and then clubbing.

11:58.345 --> 12:00.931
She kept asking for Big Red.

12:01.015 --> 12:03.308
'Cause they don't even got gum in there.

12:03.392 --> 12:05.811
You wanna know what prison is like?

12:05.895 --> 12:09.356
It's hard, and it smells like old farts.

12:09.439 --> 12:11.066
But I got people in there.

12:11.150 --> 12:13.485
I got nobody out here.

12:13.568 --> 12:16.530
I got $40 and an old bus map.

12:17.907 --> 12:19.408
[sighs] You don't gotta make this weird.

12:19.491 --> 12:22.577
It's not weird.
Why would it be weird?

12:22.661 --> 12:25.705
Maybe 'cause we fucked the same guy
and he put a baby in me?

12:26.623 --> 12:28.458
You had a baby from that motherfucker?

12:28.542 --> 12:30.085
Not on purpose.

12:31.628 --> 12:33.005
But, yeah.

12:33.672 --> 12:36.091
She's got his ass.
[chuckles] But, like, little.

12:40.137 --> 12:43.307
What, you think I'm gonna steal
your stupid-ass waffles?

12:45.810 --> 12:47.602
Sorry.

12:47.686 --> 12:49.646
I just feel like I got a sign on me.

12:51.982 --> 12:53.733
It's these stupid clothes.

12:55.986 --> 12:57.905
[indistinct PA chatter]

13:04.036 --> 13:05.245
Hey.

13:06.788 --> 13:08.540
You got any of that special shampoo?

13:09.541 --> 13:10.625
You Nichols?

13:10.709 --> 13:11.710
Yeah.

13:11.793 --> 13:13.003
Why, we got friends?

13:13.087 --> 13:15.547
Been told not to do business with you.

13:15.630 --> 13:17.216
What the fuck?

13:17.299 --> 13:18.926
Just sell me some fuckin' heroin.

13:20.970 --> 13:23.805
I was referencing the Lou Reed hit single,
obviously.

13:23.889 --> 13:24.890
Come on.

13:25.975 --> 13:27.935
Look, this isn't right.

13:28.018 --> 13:29.644
I wanna talk to the boss lady.

13:29.728 --> 13:30.855
She's busy.

13:41.740 --> 13:43.367
What's going on?

13:43.450 --> 13:46.161
What, some kind of discrimination
against people with frizzy hair?

13:46.954 --> 13:48.497
Something like that.

13:48.580 --> 13:51.166
Man, who the fuck is blackballing me?

13:53.502 --> 13:54.794
[gasps]

13:56.046 --> 13:59.049
I don't know what poison you and your
hillbilly friends are peddling,

13:59.674 --> 14:02.469
but if you sell any of it to Nichols...

14:02.552 --> 14:05.139
you will never know
what's really in your food,

14:05.222 --> 14:06.848
and I assure you...

14:06.932 --> 14:09.768
I can slip in untold horrors.

14:09.851 --> 14:12.521
I'm not doing that no more.

14:12.604 --> 14:16.233
Morello and the bug-eyed black girl
found out about the poop thing.

14:16.816 --> 14:17.817
Um...

14:17.902 --> 14:21.738
[laughs] Truthfully, I was really starting
to gross myself out anyway.

14:21.821 --> 14:22.822
Not to get too graphic--

14:22.907 --> 14:25.325
Yes, spare me the details.

14:29.454 --> 14:31.081
Oh, then again.

14:31.165 --> 14:33.500
Once a business woman,
always a business woman.

14:33.583 --> 14:36.461
So, what...
What are you gonna give me in return...

14:36.545 --> 14:38.047
for my cooperation?

14:40.925 --> 14:42.384
Right, she's dead to me.

15:00.819 --> 15:02.196
[Sister Ingalls exhales]

15:08.577 --> 15:09.578
[sighs]

15:21.506 --> 15:22.549
[sighs]

15:26.261 --> 15:27.596
Yoo-hoo?

15:31.683 --> 15:33.060
[sighs]

15:35.395 --> 15:37.106
[gasps] Yes!

16:19.189 --> 16:20.690
[chuckles softly]

16:30.742 --> 16:32.286
Autograph time, Mr. C.

16:32.369 --> 16:33.870
[inhales sharply]

16:36.206 --> 16:37.457
[sighs]

16:38.750 --> 16:40.835
Why does this week's menu say...

16:40.919 --> 16:43.547
"truffle cheesesteak"
and "surf and turf"?

16:43.630 --> 16:48.552
[laughs] I thought I'd pimp up the words
to boost morale. It's still slop.

16:48.635 --> 16:51.471
Change it back.
What's next?

16:51.555 --> 16:54.058
Uh... tonight's movie night pick.

16:55.809 --> 16:57.936
<i>-The Wiz?</i>
-How'd that get in there?

16:58.020 --> 17:01.106
Isn't that the one where Diana Ross
plays a 12-year-old?

17:01.190 --> 17:03.817
Well, Tom Hanks
plays a 12-year-old in <i>Big.</i>

17:03.900 --> 17:05.944
Yeah, well, that was part of the premise.

17:06.028 --> 17:08.113
But, man...

17:08.196 --> 17:09.656
the costumes?

17:09.739 --> 17:12.159
People in the '70s
were just more creative.

17:12.242 --> 17:14.453
And not to get all political with you,

17:14.536 --> 17:17.705
but the past 11 movies
have all been romantic comedies

17:17.789 --> 17:19.333
starring white people.

17:19.415 --> 17:22.919
Because the past 11 movies
came from a box of VHS tapes

17:23.002 --> 17:25.089
that Fig pulled out of her basement.

17:25.172 --> 17:27.465
Do we even have a copy of <i>The Wiz?</i>

17:27.549 --> 17:30.552
Yeah, I found one in the library,
under "Ethnic."

17:30.635 --> 17:32.762
People need positive role models
around here.

17:32.846 --> 17:35.682
Take Dorothy, for example,

17:35.765 --> 17:40.604
an inner-city school teacher who learns
how to ease on down the road,

17:40.687 --> 17:42.647
makes friends with lions and robots,

17:42.731 --> 17:46.360
and frees a bunch of slaves using...

17:46.443 --> 17:48.653
peaceful resistance, i.e...

17:49.654 --> 17:51.365
dance!

17:51.448 --> 17:54.493
If you can live with the fact
that everyone is gonna blame you

17:54.576 --> 17:56.578
when they're miserable tonight...

17:56.661 --> 17:58.372
-you can have <i>The Wiz.</i>
-Thank you.

17:58.455 --> 18:00.082
Now, ease on out of here.

18:00.165 --> 18:01.875
Yes, sir, I'm out of this bitch.

18:01.958 --> 18:04.043
[Maritza coughing]

18:04.128 --> 18:05.337
[retching]

18:06.255 --> 18:08.423
[indistinct walkie-talkie chatter]

18:14.304 --> 18:15.722
[sniffles]

18:20.935 --> 18:24.356
You know, I saw Humps taking her
to the guard house yesterday. Alone.

18:26.566 --> 18:28.943
It's too soon to be pregnant puking.

18:29.027 --> 18:30.654
I didn't say he fucked her.

18:30.737 --> 18:32.114
Well, why else?

18:32.197 --> 18:33.490
Dude's weird.

18:35.492 --> 18:38.162
He came over to my place last week,
we have a couple of drinks,

18:38.245 --> 18:39.413
and this cockroach crawls out.

18:39.496 --> 18:41.956
But instead of stepping on it, he...

18:42.040 --> 18:43.041
put it in the blender.

18:45.127 --> 18:46.711
He's probably fucking Ramos, though.

18:48.213 --> 18:51.133
-You boys are all teenagers.
-Hey, I didn't do anything!

18:51.216 --> 18:54.428
It's like when a dude date rapes a girl
at a frat house.

18:54.511 --> 18:56.888
-It's everyone's fault.
-Exactly.

18:56.971 --> 18:59.308
'Cause we're in a brotherhood.
Even you, McCullough.

18:59.391 --> 19:02.227
And Humps, he's just our weirdo
roach-liquefying kid brother.

19:03.061 --> 19:05.522
Maybe Ramos was causing trouble, right?

19:05.605 --> 19:08.733
Or... or Humps was having a bad day.
We don't know.

19:08.817 --> 19:09.901
What we do know is,

19:09.984 --> 19:13.822
we're the ones on the ground
making the tough calls every day.

19:18.243 --> 19:20.662
-I mean, it's not like we have any proof.
-Yeah.

19:20.745 --> 19:22.622
He could have been making her
a sandwich for all we know.

19:23.332 --> 19:24.541
[softly] Yeah.

19:27.919 --> 19:29.838
[indistinct PA chatter]

19:32.799 --> 19:36.511
I don't know about this time machine,
but in my experience,

19:36.595 --> 19:38.763
people travel through wormholes.

19:39.973 --> 19:42.058
I thought your book was fictional.

19:42.141 --> 19:43.142
No.

19:43.227 --> 19:47.731
Uh, the emotions were fictional,
but the science was real.

19:47.814 --> 19:50.024
Well, I know where I'd wormhole back to.

19:51.193 --> 19:52.361
My wedding day.

19:53.069 --> 19:56.490
Oh, I would live that over and over again.

19:57.782 --> 20:00.034
Especially the lovemaking part.

20:01.453 --> 20:04.706
Oh, we were so connected for that hour.

20:04.789 --> 20:06.750
Our skin was touching.

20:07.626 --> 20:11.463
And our brains weren't distracted
or suspicious...

20:11.546 --> 20:13.089
nothing.

20:16.050 --> 20:18.762
Did I tell you that he's been
spending time with my sister?

20:18.845 --> 20:20.889
-[stammers] I told you that already? No?
-[chuckles] Uh-uh...

20:20.972 --> 20:23.099
Oh, yeah, they're friends now.

20:23.182 --> 20:25.310
-Yeah. Yeah, that's a thing.
-[mop banging]

20:25.394 --> 20:29.231
[angrily] You know, just them...
hanging out together, all the time.

20:29.314 --> 20:32.317
-[mop banging continues]
-[grunts loudly]

20:32.401 --> 20:34.319
[coughing]

20:34.403 --> 20:35.945
[breathes deeply]

20:36.029 --> 20:38.323
Oh, my, I'm sorry.
[laughs]

20:38.407 --> 20:40.325
What about you?

20:40.409 --> 20:43.119
[stammers] When would you go back to?

20:44.203 --> 20:47.332
I think I'd go back to that night
outside the broom closet.

20:47.416 --> 20:50.544
Oh... with the ex?

20:50.627 --> 20:52.296
Yeah... Yo.

20:53.380 --> 20:57.509
We were supposed to do the dance
with no pants, but...

20:57.592 --> 20:59.093
[clicks tongue] chickened out.

20:59.177 --> 21:02.431
Oh, well, you weren't ready.
That's okay.

21:02.514 --> 21:05.267
[inhales sharply]
Turns out, she's crazier than me.

21:05.350 --> 21:06.393
[chuckles]

21:07.436 --> 21:10.188
I... Than I...

21:10.272 --> 21:12.190
Yeah.

21:12.274 --> 21:15.068
I caught her once making
a portrait of me out of hair.

21:15.151 --> 21:17.779
And I'm pretty sure it was my hair.

21:17.862 --> 21:21.366
Like, she stole... my hair.

21:21.450 --> 21:24.202
Isn't that kind of flattering, though?

21:26.120 --> 21:30.792
What if I missed my only chance
to get physical with another person?

21:31.209 --> 21:34.754
You don't need a time machine for that.

21:34.838 --> 21:37.674
That closet is right where you left it.

21:47.601 --> 21:50.186
I forgot what my hips look like.
[chuckles]

21:51.355 --> 21:53.272
You could borrow my wedges
when we get home.

21:54.316 --> 21:57.777
I'm not staying with you.
I only wrote that for the paperwork.

21:57.861 --> 21:58.987
Oh.

22:00.279 --> 22:01.531
Okay.

22:09.914 --> 22:10.915
[sighs]

22:18.214 --> 22:21.718
You can't send clothes in care packages.
CO will send them back.

22:21.801 --> 22:25.346
[scoffs] Please, like I would
ever shop for Cesar.

22:25.430 --> 22:26.723
He's so picky.

22:27.724 --> 22:29.058
You got a brother or something?

22:29.142 --> 22:30.435
No.

22:31.853 --> 22:33.104
[speaking Spanish] Loose as a shoelace.

22:35.148 --> 22:37.191
[speaking English] Cesar got,
like, ten years.

22:37.275 --> 22:38.359
I'm supposed to be a nun?

22:38.443 --> 22:42.321
[scoffs] That's fucked up.
That man did good by you.

22:42.406 --> 22:44.449
Why you so mad?

22:44.533 --> 22:46.618
It's not like Cesar was ever
straight with you,

22:46.701 --> 22:48.703
even before you went away.

22:48.787 --> 22:50.539
But suddenly you his big defender?

22:50.622 --> 22:52.248
Men are stupid.

22:52.331 --> 22:55.084
And their peckers all got ADD, what?

22:55.168 --> 22:59.255
For the record, if you hadn't gone down,
I probably wouldn't be in the picture.

22:59.338 --> 23:01.425
I went away because
I took the heat for him!

23:01.508 --> 23:04.886
Because that's what you do
when you love somebody.

23:04.969 --> 23:06.345
But I guess you wouldn't get that.

23:06.430 --> 23:11.017
Hey! I love Cesar,
but I also love myself,

23:11.100 --> 23:15.021
and I love my baby,
and it don't do me nor her no damn good

23:15.104 --> 23:16.690
if my ass is in prison.

23:16.773 --> 23:18.357
You're a fucking bitch!

23:18.442 --> 23:21.194
A fucking bitch who borrowed a car

23:21.277 --> 23:23.029
to come and get your ungrateful,

23:23.112 --> 23:26.157
old-school,
low self-esteem ass from upstate

23:26.240 --> 23:27.408
and bring her to my home?

23:27.492 --> 23:28.868
You know what? [sighs]

23:30.454 --> 23:31.830
I'm out of here.

23:33.832 --> 23:36.626
Miss, you gotta pay for that.

23:53.893 --> 23:56.187
[sighs] Shit.

23:57.438 --> 23:58.439
[exhales]

24:00.942 --> 24:02.276
-It's a musical?
-Mmm-hmm.

24:02.360 --> 24:03.361
-Yeah!
-[all laugh]

24:03.444 --> 24:06.447
That's why I don't know it,
'cause it's gay.

24:06.531 --> 24:09.117
You gay now... with Judy.

24:09.200 --> 24:10.952
-[Taystee exclaims]
-[imitates kissing]

24:11.035 --> 24:13.913
Correction, I'm fake gay...

24:13.997 --> 24:17.166
with a beautiful human
who's making it rain for all of us.

24:17.250 --> 24:19.252
Mmm-mmm.
Ain't raining in my world...

24:19.335 --> 24:21.254
[chewing] until I see money
in my commissary account.

24:21.337 --> 24:24.591
-[Taystee] Mmm.
-Janae, it's coming.

24:24.674 --> 24:27.135
In the meantime, feel it.

24:27.218 --> 24:30.597
Wealth is a state of mind,
not some number in a bank account.

24:30.680 --> 24:33.642
Money talk.
Ah, it's so boring. [giggles]

24:33.725 --> 24:35.727
-[Judy chuckles]
-[Taystee] Mmm-hmm.

24:36.728 --> 24:38.980
Oh, no, it's cool, ain't nobody looking.

24:39.063 --> 24:40.857
Oh, no, this is not for the guards.

24:40.940 --> 24:42.942
It's about my chocolate love.

24:43.026 --> 24:44.694
[Black Cindy purring]

24:46.279 --> 24:48.447
Oh, come on, y'all, I was just kidding.

24:48.532 --> 24:50.617
[scoffs] Lord.

24:50.700 --> 24:52.702
All right, so what are we
all talking about?

24:52.786 --> 24:56.831
How Caputo did me a solid,
and let me pick movie night tonight!

24:56.915 --> 24:58.542
-[Judy] No!
-I hate <i>The Wiz.</i>

24:58.625 --> 25:00.334
Sorry, am I allowed to say that?

25:00.418 --> 25:01.920
Mmm, it's cool.

25:02.003 --> 25:03.504
-Me, too.
-[Brook] Oh, my gosh.

25:03.588 --> 25:05.799
Come on, the beginning is so boring.

25:05.882 --> 25:08.593
Like, when they're all eating ham,
and Diana Ross is just complaining

25:08.677 --> 25:10.887
about how she's never been
below 125th Street.

25:10.970 --> 25:12.388
Hold up, hold up.

25:12.471 --> 25:14.933
You telling me, the premise of <i>The Wiz</i> is

25:15.016 --> 25:17.185
some bitch ain't never gone
below 125th Street?

25:17.268 --> 25:19.145
Diana Ross, not "some bitch."

25:19.228 --> 25:20.271
-Right?
-Respect!

25:20.354 --> 25:22.566
[Poussey] I mean, ain't there, like,
dancing subway pillars,

25:22.649 --> 25:24.734
and weird glow-in-the-dark
graffiti everywhere?

25:24.818 --> 25:26.736
[Brook] I mean, the production values
are so cheesy.

25:26.820 --> 25:30.073
Look, I'm sorry, T, I'm gonna have
to side with my girl on this.

25:30.156 --> 25:31.365
<i>-The Wiz</i> is kinda lame.
-[Brook winces]

25:31.449 --> 25:32.909
I like <i>The Wiz.</i>

25:32.992 --> 25:36.537
See? Somebody's on my side.

25:36.621 --> 25:38.707
What about that part
when Glinda the Good Witch

25:38.790 --> 25:43.002
comes floating in on her magic bubble,
and her skin's all white and sparkly?

25:43.086 --> 25:45.922
[inhales deeply]
That's the white people version.

25:46.005 --> 25:48.007
<i>The Wizard of Oz!</i>

25:48.758 --> 25:50.051
Oh.

25:50.134 --> 25:51.886
Well, I like that one.

25:57.391 --> 25:59.060
[Sister Ingalls exhaling]

26:00.103 --> 26:01.896
Damn this arthritis.

26:01.980 --> 26:03.940
It helps if I take little steps.

26:08.612 --> 26:09.654
[groans]

26:12.115 --> 26:14.200
[indistinct walkie-talkie chatter]

26:18.705 --> 26:20.206
[exaggerated groaning]

26:23.668 --> 26:25.503
Don't I get some privacy?

26:26.295 --> 26:27.588
Gotta cuff you first.

26:27.672 --> 26:29.465
Oh, of course.

26:29.548 --> 26:30.967
[sighs] Shackle away.

26:31.926 --> 26:34.428
-[sneezes loudly]
-[phone clatters]

26:41.853 --> 26:43.647
Our poop is gonna go down there?

26:43.730 --> 26:45.273
Beats me.

26:45.356 --> 26:48.234
Everything I know about plumbing,
I learned from playing <i>Mario Brothers.</i>

26:49.277 --> 26:51.696
It was that black girl who works
in Caputo's office.

26:51.780 --> 26:53.657
The terrorist one with the turban?

26:53.740 --> 26:55.033
-No.
-Cocoa puffs?

26:55.116 --> 26:56.660
No, no, the one with the fancy watch.

26:56.743 --> 26:58.745
I heard her bragging
about it in the cafeteria.

26:58.828 --> 27:02.916
First the Dominicans take the TV room,
now the blacks are controlling the movies.

27:02.999 --> 27:05.001
We should host our own film festival,

27:05.084 --> 27:07.712
that celebrates the accomplishments
of white people.

27:07.796 --> 27:08.838
But that'll be hard, though,

27:08.922 --> 27:11.424
because Morgan Freeman's in,
like, everything.

27:11.507 --> 27:12.759
Fuckin' Morgan Freeman.

27:15.136 --> 27:16.763
[Piper] I think I owe you an apology.

27:17.931 --> 27:20.016
For enabling you out in the corn.

27:20.099 --> 27:22.351
[Nicky] What happens in the corn
stays in the corn, right?

27:23.394 --> 27:24.938
[Piper] I can't stop thinking about it.

27:25.021 --> 27:26.981
[scoffs] Oh, that's what
you can't stop thinking about?

27:27.065 --> 27:28.775
How about Vause chop suey-ing a guy?

27:28.858 --> 27:31.736
It seems like that's a much bigger
headline than my short fall off the wagon.

27:31.820 --> 27:33.446
-I'm trying to say I'm worried about you.
-Are you?

27:33.529 --> 27:36.532
Or are you attempting to assuage some
of that guilt you've been carrying around?

27:36.615 --> 27:38.159
Can it be both?

27:39.535 --> 27:40.954
[sighs] Man...

27:41.955 --> 27:45.083
I screwed up long before our time
in the corn, Chapman, all right?

27:45.166 --> 27:47.251
It's not on you. [sighs]

27:47.335 --> 27:50.671
The really fucked up thing is
I had three years clean before that,

27:50.755 --> 27:52.381
and now I'm back to zero.

27:52.465 --> 27:54.633
Like, whoosh,
the whole thing never happened.

27:54.718 --> 27:57.095
No, three years clean is something.
That's not nothing.

27:57.178 --> 27:59.222
[stammers] How do I forgive myself
for doing that?

27:59.305 --> 28:01.390
That's my million dollar fucking
question, right?

28:02.641 --> 28:03.642
[sighs]

28:09.315 --> 28:11.943
Back it up, you know you're
not allowed to be in here.

28:12.026 --> 28:15.947
You're not allowed to eat soba noodles
without a little scallion.

28:16.030 --> 28:19.658
Fresh from the garden.
Added a little ginger, too.

28:20.869 --> 28:21.953
Thanks.

28:22.036 --> 28:24.288
I've noticed you always bring
home-cooked lunches.

28:24.372 --> 28:29.878
Good for you. Most of the guards
eat Hot Pockets or S'mores Pop Tarts,

28:29.961 --> 28:31.670
but you're a gourmet.

28:31.755 --> 28:33.381
Yeah, I used to eat like them.

28:33.464 --> 28:34.632
[clears throat]
But then I started watching

28:34.715 --> 28:37.510
those cooking competition shows
and got obsessed.

28:37.593 --> 28:38.970
Now, I can't stomach that crap.

28:39.053 --> 28:40.263
Me neither.

28:40.346 --> 28:43.182
Something else I can't stomach...

28:43.266 --> 28:47.020
watching friends of mine
succumb to certain temptations.

28:48.021 --> 28:49.688
Chemical temptations.

28:49.773 --> 28:51.357
[indistinct radio chatter]

28:52.608 --> 28:54.485
I wouldn't know what
inmates do in private.

28:54.568 --> 28:55.820
Of course.

28:55.904 --> 28:57.822
Neither does Piscatella.

28:57.906 --> 29:02.660
In fact, he has no idea about this
curious cycle of redistribution

29:02.744 --> 29:04.453
going on behind his back.

29:04.537 --> 29:06.705
One little baggie frisked
from this inmate,

29:06.790 --> 29:08.958
resold to that inmate.

29:11.169 --> 29:12.837
Out against the fence.

29:12.921 --> 29:14.338
Now!

29:14.422 --> 29:16.007
-[stammers]
-Let's go!

29:17.967 --> 29:20.553
-Who the fuck you think you are, old lady?
-[grunts]

29:20.636 --> 29:24.849
Walkin' around here like you own
the place, threatenin' me.

29:24.933 --> 29:27.393
[Red] Well, I know you can't threaten me,

29:27.476 --> 29:29.103
at least not with the SHU.

29:29.187 --> 29:31.397
I've been tryin' to get reservations
down there for weeks,

29:31.480 --> 29:34.025
but it's all booked up.

29:34.108 --> 29:35.734
Who told you that?

29:35.819 --> 29:37.278
Old ladies, you know.

29:37.361 --> 29:41.532
We have bad hearing,
and yet we know all the gossip.

29:42.366 --> 29:43.492
What is this?

29:45.286 --> 29:46.996
-Are you lookin' to buy?
-No.

29:47.080 --> 29:49.748
I don't want to buy.
I want to embargo.

29:57.173 --> 29:58.257
[blows]

30:03.930 --> 30:05.056
I was thinking.

30:05.139 --> 30:07.725
There are certain physical experiences
on this planet

30:07.809 --> 30:10.144
that every living person should have.

30:10.228 --> 30:13.564
And I know I freaked out in the woods,

30:13.647 --> 30:17.360
but real dinner is better than
fake gingerbread and wood rot.

30:17.443 --> 30:20.571
That said, I will admit
that sometimes at night,

30:20.654 --> 30:24.533
I do touch the inside of my arm
and the soft part of my earlobe,

30:24.617 --> 30:25.869
and I get this...

30:27.245 --> 30:28.287
tingly feeling.

30:28.371 --> 30:33.042
And, okay, I did suspect you
of pooping in the shower

30:33.126 --> 30:36.629
which is way worse than peeing
outside a bunk, for the record,

30:36.712 --> 30:38.923
but you didn't leave me poop...

30:41.550 --> 30:43.094
You left me gifts.

30:44.220 --> 30:46.680
Like hair portraits.

30:47.640 --> 30:48.641
[sighs]

30:48.724 --> 30:53.855
Anyhow, I'm... really confused
about all this, but...

30:55.940 --> 30:59.818
if you might, maybe, perhaps...

30:59.903 --> 31:03.697
want to try
the broom closet thing again...

31:04.365 --> 31:06.409
I...

31:06.492 --> 31:07.535
might...

31:08.577 --> 31:09.913
maybe...

31:11.080 --> 31:12.373
perhaps...

31:13.666 --> 31:14.667
be open to it.

31:18.587 --> 31:20.131
That's it.
Okay, bye.

31:22.926 --> 31:25.344
I was thinking during movie night.
Okay, bye.

31:26.595 --> 31:29.473
Hey! I've been meaning to ask you
about your wormhole theory.

31:29.557 --> 31:32.351
See, on paper...

31:32.435 --> 31:34.437
it's sound, right?

31:34.520 --> 31:36.981
But in real life, that is flawed.

31:37.065 --> 31:41.069
You might be using too much
tin foil on the time machine.

31:41.152 --> 31:43.071
Messes with the electromagnetic radiation.

31:43.988 --> 31:46.157
Next time, try wax paper.

31:46.240 --> 31:48.701
[gasps] Oh, thanks for the tip.

31:50.494 --> 31:51.495
[softly] Wow.

31:54.832 --> 31:58.044
-Can I have a seat?
-No, you can talk to me while standing.

31:58.127 --> 32:01.547
Okay, well, speaking of standing, um...

32:01.630 --> 32:03.549
I feel obligated to voice...

32:04.800 --> 32:06.052
to voice my concern...

32:07.178 --> 32:10.556
over some of the practices that have
been happening around here lately.

32:11.140 --> 32:13.017
Uh, you know, not my concern...

32:14.018 --> 32:15.937
my outrage.

32:16.020 --> 32:18.606
My moral outrage,
to be honest with you.

32:19.523 --> 32:22.318
Okay, uh...
Please, be honest.

32:23.402 --> 32:25.363
This Flores thing, for example.

32:26.905 --> 32:31.160
It is cruel and gross and humiliating.

32:31.244 --> 32:33.204
It's like putting somebody in the stocks.

32:33.287 --> 32:35.999
Plus, standing
for prolonged periods of time

32:36.082 --> 32:39.418
causes irreversible joint and back pain.

32:39.502 --> 32:44.090
Well, maybe her noble heritage
gives her extra strong joints.

32:45.133 --> 32:47.051
I get the irony of the situation.

32:47.551 --> 32:51.180
Next, you're gonna tell me that gangs
help provide order and safety?

32:51.264 --> 32:53.682
Look, I know what it's like to fuck up.

32:53.766 --> 32:56.602
I know what it's like to cross a line
and then wish, retroactively,

32:56.685 --> 32:57.686
that you hadn't.

32:57.770 --> 33:02.984
And it's a shitty, shitty feeling.

33:03.067 --> 33:05.361
And I wish that somebody had told me
a very long time ago

33:05.444 --> 33:07.571
that it's okay to just...

33:07.655 --> 33:09.240
stop.

33:09.323 --> 33:10.992
To just back down.

33:12.910 --> 33:15.913
To not be so stubborn or worried
about appearing weak.

33:16.664 --> 33:18.916
You're right, I did mess up.

33:20.126 --> 33:24.338
I allowed you to think you have some sort
of special privilege around here...

33:24.422 --> 33:25.464
which you don't.

33:25.548 --> 33:29.593
In fact, the next time
you care to express something to me...

33:30.428 --> 33:32.055
you can write me a letter...

33:33.722 --> 33:35.891
and then shove it up your tight,
little heinie.

33:40.771 --> 33:42.023
Get out of my office.

33:44.567 --> 33:45.568
Out!

33:48.279 --> 33:51.199
And after you got the camera to Burset,

33:51.282 --> 33:54.452
how were you gonna get the photo out?

33:54.535 --> 33:57.288
That ten-year-old Motorola
didn't even have Internet.

33:58.914 --> 34:00.708
I have my ways.

34:00.791 --> 34:01.792
Oh.

34:01.875 --> 34:03.627
Well, don't ever become a spy.

34:03.711 --> 34:05.963
Sophia is falling apart down here.

34:07.131 --> 34:08.882
At least I didn't stand by idly.

34:08.966 --> 34:10.967
So, if you want to punish me
for having a...

34:11.052 --> 34:13.554
a conscience, then, fine.

34:13.637 --> 34:16.181
I am not punishing you
for your conscience.

34:16.264 --> 34:20.643
I am punishing you because
you assaulted another inmate,

34:20.728 --> 34:23.438
you smuggled contraband,

34:23.522 --> 34:27.068
and you conspired
to leak private information.

34:27.150 --> 34:28.610
You made your bed, Sister.

34:29.987 --> 34:31.322
Now you're gonna lie in it.

34:32.822 --> 34:35.534
Any idea how long, exactly?

34:58.056 --> 34:59.267
Burset!

35:03.396 --> 35:04.397
[phone clicks]

35:05.856 --> 35:07.650
-[Ouija] Yep.
-[Maria laughing]

35:07.733 --> 35:09.610
[Ouija] Oh, that is so true, yo.
[Maria] But, right?

35:09.693 --> 35:13.197
[Ouija] My moms is in love with him,
like, in love.

35:13.281 --> 35:14.323
-[Dayanara] Hey.
-[laughing] Hey.

35:14.407 --> 35:18.161
Hey, we were just talking about how
all Latinas love Morrissey.

35:18.244 --> 35:19.537
[chuckles] Yeah, that's funny.

35:19.620 --> 35:21.079
-[all laugh]
-Maybe it's the hair.

35:21.164 --> 35:23.457
-Totally! That pompadour.
-Yeah, the... Yeah. [laughs]

35:23.541 --> 35:25.668
-[Maria] Wow.
-Oh, shit. You do nails?

35:26.001 --> 35:27.002
My mom did.

35:27.085 --> 35:28.587
I think I do more, like, designs,

35:28.671 --> 35:30.964
patterns, little bunnies,
things like that.

35:31.048 --> 35:32.800
Oh, could you do mine, but, like,

35:32.883 --> 35:35.636
alternate it with, like,
bunnies and skulls, so, like,

35:35.719 --> 35:38.306
every other finger's, like,
bunny, skull, bunny, skull?

35:38.389 --> 35:40.474
Yeah, that should be cool.

35:48.316 --> 35:50.318
Sorry. Should I just come back later?

35:51.319 --> 35:52.945
You can stay.

35:53.028 --> 35:54.363
Unless it's gonna be a problem.

35:57.533 --> 35:59.285
Nah, it's fine.

36:00.328 --> 36:01.454
[Dayanara clicks tongue]

36:01.537 --> 36:03.414
[sighs contentedly]

36:04.623 --> 36:06.584
So, what do you want first,
like, a bunny or a skull?

36:06.667 --> 36:08.419
[scoffs] Skull, obviously.

36:12.965 --> 36:14.383
[buzzing]

36:17.470 --> 36:19.054
[siren wailing faintly]

36:20.848 --> 36:22.015
Yo, Jazmina!

36:23.058 --> 36:24.810
Open up, it's me!

36:30.233 --> 36:31.692
You a ghost all of a sudden?

36:33.486 --> 36:36.364
I had to get Cesar's baby mama
to pick me up,

36:36.447 --> 36:39.575
'cause my own damn cousin
is too busy to pick up her phone?

36:39.658 --> 36:42.995
I've been callin' you for weeks.
Where the fuck you been at?

36:43.078 --> 36:45.163
[Jazmina in Spanish]
Ever since we switched to the family plan,

36:45.248 --> 36:47.208
my phone's been acting weird.

36:48.209 --> 36:49.627
Wow, so you out now?

36:49.710 --> 36:51.712
No, I escaped like Houdini.

36:54.923 --> 36:56.884
Now tell me what's up.

36:56.967 --> 36:58.594
You know Domingo?

36:59.637 --> 37:01.096
That midget from the bodega?

37:01.179 --> 37:02.265
Uh-huh.

37:02.348 --> 37:05.226
Yeah, he's getting scuba certified
all month,

37:05.309 --> 37:08.771
so he gave me these VCRs to unload.

37:08.854 --> 37:13.901
This whole planned obsolescence thing
is really screwing me up.

37:13.984 --> 37:16.279
[speaking English] Yo, Jazmina,
what the hell you talkin' about?

37:16.362 --> 37:18.906
You ain't even making any sense.

37:18.989 --> 37:20.157
I'm just happy to see you.

37:22.285 --> 37:24.662
Yo, we should get
some of that champagne soda!

37:24.745 --> 37:25.871
Right? Celebrate!

37:25.954 --> 37:28.457
Yeah, no, I ain't got no time
to celebrate right now.

37:28.541 --> 37:29.625
Where's my sock?

37:29.708 --> 37:31.627
I already used up
all the cash they gave me.

37:31.710 --> 37:34.880
[sighs] All right, here's the thing.

37:34.963 --> 37:39.968
My asthma been acting up.
I had to go to the ER, which wasn't cheap.

37:41.053 --> 37:43.013
And then last month, KK got arrested.

37:44.139 --> 37:47.017
Some stupid DUI, but they took him
all the way up to Rikers

37:47.100 --> 37:49.603
and claimed that he had, like,
all these other charges.

37:49.687 --> 37:51.855
Bail was real expensive, you know?

37:53.691 --> 37:56.109
We weren't expecting you
for another few more months.

37:57.611 --> 38:00.781
-You spent it.
-Borrowed. I borrowed it.

38:00.864 --> 38:03.992
-You stupid, selfish cunt!
-Hey! We family.

38:04.076 --> 38:05.619
Yeah, we family!

38:05.703 --> 38:08.205
That's why I gave you
everything I fucking had!

38:09.247 --> 38:10.248
[sighs]

38:12.668 --> 38:16.589
What about my clothes? My shoes?
You sell those, too?

38:16.672 --> 38:17.715
No.

38:19.174 --> 38:20.468
Not your shoes.

38:20.551 --> 38:22.511
How fuckin' stupid can you be?

38:24.513 --> 38:26.599
I'm getting out of prison.

38:26.682 --> 38:28.601
You think I wouldn't need any cash?

38:28.684 --> 38:30.143
You think I wouldn't need clothes?

38:30.227 --> 38:32.730
I'm gonna pay you back for everything,
I swear.

38:32.813 --> 38:34.106
[scoffs]

38:35.983 --> 38:38.235
Yo, if you want, I could
hook you up with Domingo.

38:39.152 --> 38:40.779
You know, get you back on your feet?

38:42.072 --> 38:44.992
Meantime, you know you can crash here
as long as you need.

38:45.075 --> 38:46.785
Come on, we can share the bed.

38:47.786 --> 38:49.538
You know, like old times.

38:55.378 --> 38:56.587
So, when are we gonna make a move

38:56.670 --> 38:58.714
on the water fountains
between B and C dorms?

38:58.797 --> 39:00.841
I mean, if we wait too long,
the Dominicans are gonna grab it.

39:01.425 --> 39:03.927
Also, we need to talk about
where to stand in the yard.

39:04.011 --> 39:05.388
I found this spot over by the dumpsters,

39:05.471 --> 39:07.890
but I know Sankey thinks we should
stand somewhere with more visibility.

39:07.973 --> 39:09.850
Sankey is so driven.

39:09.933 --> 39:10.976
[Angie] I know, right?

39:11.059 --> 39:12.310
-[chuckles]
-[Pennsatucky] Sankey?

39:12.936 --> 39:14.563
-She on construction?
-[Brandy] Yeah.

39:14.647 --> 39:17.816
She's actually a lot like you used to be,
all in charge and stuff,

39:17.900 --> 39:20.486
but also really, um...

39:20.569 --> 39:21.570
charisma.

39:21.654 --> 39:23.406
[Brandy] And she has amazing hair,
like gold.

39:23.489 --> 39:26.158
And she's, like, the funniest person
you've ever met. [chuckles]

39:26.241 --> 39:27.493
[overlapping chatter]

39:27.576 --> 39:28.911
[all laughing]

39:29.953 --> 39:32.415
[Angie] Wait a minute,
did we talk about this?

39:32.498 --> 39:34.750
I used to collect troll dolls...

39:47.220 --> 39:49.765
[Luschek] Hey, schnookums.

39:49.848 --> 39:52.100
-Looking for somethin'?
-Uh, yeah, man.

39:52.184 --> 39:53.561
I'm lookin' for those letters I wrote you.

39:53.644 --> 39:56.063
I'm hopin' to recycle them
into "fuck you" origami.

39:56.146 --> 39:59.942
Oh, you can't fool me.
Origami doesn't have words.

40:00.025 --> 40:01.694
Hi, by the way.

40:01.777 --> 40:04.279
[sighs] Come on, man, just...

40:05.489 --> 40:08.576
don't make this any more humiliating
than it has to be, all right?

40:08.659 --> 40:10.578
My blood sugar's crashing.

40:10.661 --> 40:11.954
I need some sweet relief.

40:12.621 --> 40:14.915
I thought you were sober.

40:14.998 --> 40:17.418
Yeah, well, things change.

40:18.210 --> 40:19.795
Jesus Christ!

40:19.878 --> 40:21.755
I brought you back here
like two minutes ago.

40:21.839 --> 40:25.008
[stammers] What do you mean,
you brought me back up here?

40:25.092 --> 40:28.011
What does that mean?
You had a hand in me comin' up the hill?

40:28.095 --> 40:33.308
[chuckles] Uh, well, not a hand
so much as...

40:33.391 --> 40:36.228
uh, other body parts.

40:37.020 --> 40:38.564
<i>No comprende.</i>

40:40.232 --> 40:42.150
I, uh...

40:42.234 --> 40:44.319
I fucked Judy King.

40:45.488 --> 40:48.824
-The old chef lady?
-Yeah, it was very <i>Harold and Maude.</i>

40:48.907 --> 40:52.495
[scoffs] Except you're 30 and broke.
I mean, has she killed herself yet?

40:52.578 --> 40:53.746
[breathing heavily]

40:53.829 --> 40:57.082
Uh, we are talkin' about, uh,
Judy King, the celebrity, right?

40:57.165 --> 40:59.543
Not some scabby, toothless crack whore
by the same name?

40:59.627 --> 41:02.087
Celebrity chef.
My lover.

41:03.046 --> 41:04.632
And afterwards, uh...

41:04.715 --> 41:08.719
she paid off some fancy lawyer
who called Caputo...

41:08.802 --> 41:13.140
and some other backdoor politics thing
that I don't fully understand.

41:14.141 --> 41:15.601
What'd you do that for?

41:17.185 --> 41:19.312
You in love with me or something?

41:20.981 --> 41:22.190
No. [chuckles]

41:23.776 --> 41:25.486
Uh, you could say "thank you."

41:25.569 --> 41:26.779
For what?

41:27.821 --> 41:30.282
Ruining my life, then un-ruining it?

41:31.867 --> 41:34.452
Why do you think I'm back on this shit?

41:34.537 --> 41:36.997
Well, if I'd never gone to Max...

41:37.080 --> 41:38.874
[laughs] I'd still be sober.

41:38.957 --> 41:43.629
I wouldn't have to crawl back here
searching for crumbs.

41:43.712 --> 41:46.339
Oh, and by the way...

41:46.423 --> 41:51.595
only a shit-for-brains, fucktard alcoholic
falls for a card-carrying lesbo.

41:51.679 --> 41:53.180
[scoffs]

41:53.263 --> 41:56.224
If you... you wanna get high so badly...

41:56.308 --> 41:59.311
admit that it's your fault
that you went back down to Max.

41:59.394 --> 42:00.771
All right? Own your shit.

42:01.479 --> 42:03.774
[laughs] Fine.

42:05.609 --> 42:07.820
It was my fault.

42:08.987 --> 42:10.030
[smacks lips]

42:10.113 --> 42:13.283
Yeah, and we'll revisit this
if you decide to ever get sober again.

42:13.366 --> 42:15.160
Can't wait.

42:15.243 --> 42:16.954
[scoffs] Please.

42:20.958 --> 42:22.042
[shudders]

42:23.544 --> 42:24.920
[sighs]

42:31.552 --> 42:33.596
[scoffs] I didn't ask for weed.

42:34.387 --> 42:36.807
[scoffs] Right.

42:36.890 --> 42:38.726
[sniffs] Thanks.

42:39.852 --> 42:40.853
You're welcome.

42:40.936 --> 42:42.229
Psst!

42:42.312 --> 42:43.731
[whispers] Fuck you.

42:54.950 --> 42:57.494
Hey, it's movie night.
Let's go.

42:57.578 --> 43:00.372
I'm gonna skip it.
I'm too bloated.

43:01.414 --> 43:03.416
We're on the same cycle, dummy.

43:03.500 --> 43:05.085
Come on.

43:05.168 --> 43:08.463
Why you sittin' there like you got a call
from your boyfriend's wife, eh?

43:09.632 --> 43:12.593
I can't tell you.
It's too humiliating.

43:13.886 --> 43:16.554
You pee your pants or something? What?

43:19.600 --> 43:21.769
You know that new guard?

43:21.852 --> 43:23.604
White dude, looks like a mailman?

43:23.687 --> 43:25.856
Yeah, I think so.

43:27.775 --> 43:30.778
Okay. [sniffles]

43:30.861 --> 43:34.698
Yesterday, he took me
into his little house...

43:35.741 --> 43:37.785
[sniffling] and he gave me...

43:38.786 --> 43:41.371
a cup with, um...

43:43.874 --> 43:46.584
[sobbing] With, um...

43:46.669 --> 43:47.795
What?

43:48.712 --> 43:50.338
What did he bring you?

43:52.299 --> 43:53.383
Did he slip you a roofie?

43:55.468 --> 43:56.887
What? Tell me.

43:56.970 --> 43:58.430
[whispers] A mouse.

44:01.850 --> 44:03.476
Like, from the ground? Um...

44:04.853 --> 44:06.313
I don't know.

44:07.272 --> 44:08.941
[sniffles] It was a baby...

44:11.484 --> 44:15.155
[trembling]
And it was small and slippery...

44:15.238 --> 44:17.658
and not like a jelly bean at all, Flaca.

44:18.241 --> 44:19.451
[exclaims]

44:21.411 --> 44:26.709
And when I swallowed it,
I felt its little feet, with toes.

44:26.792 --> 44:28.794
[sobbing]

44:28.877 --> 44:30.587
-Oh, my God.
-[sniffles]

44:33.506 --> 44:35.300
-That's so fucked up.
-[sighs heavily]

44:36.259 --> 44:38.136
That's like some Hannibal Lecter shit.

44:40.055 --> 44:41.431
We gotta tell somebody.

44:41.514 --> 44:43.641
I don't wanna have to tell nobody.

44:43.726 --> 44:46.519
-Please don't tell nobody.
-God damn it!

44:47.730 --> 44:49.732
These guards, they think they can get...

44:49.815 --> 44:52.025
Can do whatever the fuck they want.

44:52.109 --> 44:54.152
[sniffles]

44:54.236 --> 44:56.363
Oh, God, I feel so gross.

44:56.446 --> 44:58.406
No, you're okay.
You're not gross.

44:58.490 --> 45:00.367
-Yeah.
-Come here.

45:01.326 --> 45:03.411
You probably don't even have
the plague or nothing.

45:06.123 --> 45:07.833
[indistinct chatter on headphones]

45:18.927 --> 45:21.179
[woman on headphones]
<i>...never killed nothin' in my life!</i>

45:21.263 --> 45:23.015
Save it for the judge!

45:23.098 --> 45:25.392
Killed this movie.
This movie sucks!

45:25.475 --> 45:26.643
-Can you be quiet, please?
-[inmates murmuring]

45:26.726 --> 45:28.812
Isn't that what you do?
Call and response?

45:28.896 --> 45:31.064
That's a Christian thing.
It ain't a black thing.

45:31.148 --> 45:33.025
-You sure about that, darkie?
-[Alison] Seriously.

45:33.108 --> 45:35.068
-What?
-You're ruining the film.

45:36.653 --> 45:38.030
I thought you didn't even like it.

45:38.113 --> 45:39.865
Well, I love it now.

45:52.585 --> 45:54.880
Is it okay if I stand here?

45:56.048 --> 45:57.549
Yeah.

45:58.842 --> 46:00.427
Yeah, of course.

46:01.136 --> 46:04.306
Do you ever feel like
a person without a country?

46:05.307 --> 46:06.809
[whispers] All the time.

46:19.487 --> 46:20.572
[whispers] Have you seen Nicky?

46:20.655 --> 46:22.991
We invited her, but she's not here.

46:31.541 --> 46:35.337
Piscatella told me to shove
my moral outrage up my ass.

46:36.754 --> 46:39.007
I thought you were gonna stay out
of other people's business.

46:41.801 --> 46:43.053
[inmate coughing]

46:46.806 --> 46:48.308
[clears throat]

46:50.310 --> 46:51.478
[sniffing]

46:51.561 --> 46:53.646
You smell like reefer.

47:00.653 --> 47:03.073
Who the fuck sold to her?

47:04.867 --> 47:05.951
[sniffs]

47:46.033 --> 47:47.117
I, um...

47:48.576 --> 47:49.912
Do...

47:51.079 --> 47:52.122
you...

47:52.205 --> 47:54.499
-Or should I--
-[laughs softly]

47:55.959 --> 47:57.502
Shh.
[chuckles]

47:58.921 --> 48:00.130
Relax.

48:05.385 --> 48:07.054
[Suzanne exhales]

48:10.307 --> 48:11.891
[exhales deeply]

48:13.810 --> 48:15.145
[Maureen] Mmm.
[Suzanne inhales sharply] Oh...

48:15.228 --> 48:16.813
[Maureen chuckles softly]

48:18.023 --> 48:19.316
Do you like that?

48:20.233 --> 48:21.443
[stammers] Yeah.

48:23.278 --> 48:24.487
Describe it.

48:25.655 --> 48:27.574
[breathing heavily]

48:29.909 --> 48:31.661
[stammers] A glow worm.

48:31.744 --> 48:32.996
[Maureen] Mmm.

48:35.873 --> 48:37.960
-[stammers] Glitter dots.
-Mmm.

48:38.876 --> 48:41.046
[Suzanne gasps]

48:41.129 --> 48:42.755
Lightning bolts.

48:43.966 --> 48:47.677
[moans deeply] Oh, more...
More lightning bolts.

48:49.762 --> 48:52.015
[moans] Warm squiggles.

48:52.099 --> 48:54.351
[chuckles] Are you getting close?

48:55.102 --> 48:56.311
Uh, to what?

48:56.394 --> 48:57.980
Uh, climax.

48:58.981 --> 48:59.982
Maybe?

49:01.691 --> 49:02.734
[exhales]

49:02.817 --> 49:07.322
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

49:08.198 --> 49:10.908
Oh, sweet troll.

49:10.993 --> 49:12.869
[gasping]

49:12.952 --> 49:17.457
I'm close. I'm close. I'm...

49:25.423 --> 49:26.424
Why'd you stop?

49:27.092 --> 49:30.637
So you know what it feels like to be
abandoned in the middle of the woods.

49:30.720 --> 49:32.680
[Suzanne exhales]

49:32.764 --> 49:34.641
You hurt my feelings, Suzanne.

49:36.059 --> 49:38.061
[softly] What?

49:38.145 --> 49:39.312
[sighs]

49:40.105 --> 49:43.275
News flash, Dorothy was from Kansas,
not Harlem.

49:43.358 --> 49:46.028
[Brook] News flash,
Judy Garland was from Minnesota,

49:46.111 --> 49:48.863
and Diana Ross was from Michigan,
so nobody is from Kansas.

49:48.946 --> 49:49.989
-[Poussey laughs]
-It's a movie.

49:50.073 --> 49:51.533
No one asked you, nigger-lover.

49:51.616 --> 49:54.036
-What did you say?
-[inmate] What the fuck?

49:54.119 --> 49:55.870
Yo, can you shut the fuck up?

49:55.953 --> 49:58.581
Hey, guys!
Quiet down, please.

49:58.665 --> 49:59.666
Okay?

49:59.749 --> 50:01.126
[inmates muttering]

50:02.752 --> 50:04.337
[Janae] Hmm.
Your boo?

50:04.421 --> 50:07.006
She's not only fair-skinned,
but she's fair-weathered.

50:09.342 --> 50:11.053
Yeah, she not my boo.

50:12.512 --> 50:14.306
It's all for show.

50:14.889 --> 50:18.393
It's called appropriation,
black people stealin' white people's art.

50:18.476 --> 50:20.770
I think the black girls and
the white girls are havin' a thing.

50:20.853 --> 50:22.439
No, you dumb cracker.

50:22.522 --> 50:24.899
-Who you callin' a cracker?
-[inmates gasping]

50:24.982 --> 50:27.777
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Back it up, Nazi.

50:27.860 --> 50:30.572
Or what? You'll tap dance on over here
and beat us up?

50:30.655 --> 50:31.948
[laughing]

50:32.031 --> 50:34.242
Everyone chill out, all right?
It's a movie.

50:34.326 --> 50:36.619
Man, if this escalates, we're screwed.

50:36.703 --> 50:38.496
Remember, the SHU is full.

50:38.580 --> 50:39.956
-Whatever.
-I'm ready.

50:40.039 --> 50:41.666
-You wanna go?
-Shit.

50:41.749 --> 50:43.042
[sighs]

50:45.878 --> 50:46.921
[inmates grumbling]

50:47.004 --> 50:48.673
[Coates] Everybody back to your bunks.

50:48.756 --> 50:50.049
Movie night is over.

50:50.133 --> 50:51.468
[inmate] Oh, man!

50:51.551 --> 50:53.386
It's for your own safety, let's go.

50:53.470 --> 50:56.264
Man, are you kidding me?
They didn't even meet The Wiz!

50:56.348 --> 50:57.932
The titular character!

50:58.015 --> 51:01.103
He's played by Richard Pryor, people!

51:02.437 --> 51:04.106
[laughing]

51:04.189 --> 51:06.149
Bald, white, racist fucking bitches
ruined it for everyone.

51:06.233 --> 51:07.317
Hell, yeah.

51:08.526 --> 51:10.362
[muttering]

51:11.779 --> 51:13.156
You think that's a job?

51:13.240 --> 51:15.367
Like painting pictures
for scenery and stuff?

51:15.450 --> 51:17.034
Sure, why not?

51:17.119 --> 51:18.911
Hey, can I talk to you?

51:18.995 --> 51:20.788
Sure, I'll catch up with you guys later.

51:21.956 --> 51:23.166
Honey.

51:24.167 --> 51:25.710
-You gotta be careful.
-[chuckles]

51:25.793 --> 51:28.087
Ruiz is playing a dangerous game.

51:28.171 --> 51:29.714
It's fine, she's my roommate.

51:29.797 --> 51:32.008
You don't think Al Capone had
a roommate when he was in prison?

51:32.091 --> 51:35.178
Oh, my God. I'm not stupid.
I know she's getting into other stuff.

51:35.262 --> 51:36.554
I'm not gonna get involved in any of that.

51:36.638 --> 51:39.849
You hang out with that crew,
in that salon, you involved.

51:41.518 --> 51:44.437
You wanna rebel against your mother?
That's fine.

51:44.521 --> 51:46.981
That's fine, because I'm the first person
to admit she wasn't perfect,

51:47.064 --> 51:50.277
but that don't mean that you gotta go
and screw up your own life.

51:50.360 --> 51:53.488
I wanna have friends.
I wanna hang out with people my own age,

51:53.571 --> 51:55.282
not people tryin' to be my mom
all the time.

51:56.574 --> 51:58.326
I'll see you around.

52:22.016 --> 52:23.268
Yeah?

52:24.811 --> 52:26.188
I got no place else to go.

52:27.272 --> 52:29.732
[inhales] I already set up the couch.

52:39.701 --> 52:40.952
[sirens wailing faintly]

52:41.035 --> 52:43.371
[breathes deeply]

52:49.794 --> 52:50.962
[baby crying]

53:00.263 --> 53:02.014
-[crying continues]
-[sighs]

53:09.939 --> 53:11.358
-Shh...
-[crying stops]

53:12.650 --> 53:13.818
Come on.

53:13.901 --> 53:15.403
Okay, okay.

53:15.487 --> 53:17.822
[shushing]

53:18.823 --> 53:20.032
Okay.

53:30.042 --> 53:31.294
[baby cooing]

53:37.550 --> 53:38.551
Look!

53:55.610 --> 53:58.280
Sorry, I forgot to set an alarm.

53:59.364 --> 54:02.784
First, you make me meet you in Oneonta,
then you're 45 minutes late?

54:02.867 --> 54:04.869
You know, one of us has an actual job.

54:04.952 --> 54:05.953
Oh, I see.

54:06.037 --> 54:08.331
You think I run a 501c3 out of my bed?

54:08.415 --> 54:10.166
-[sighs]
-I have three employees.

54:10.249 --> 54:12.919
Now, let's see this
Pulitzer-winning photo.

54:16.714 --> 54:17.882
You wrapped it in a T-shirt?

54:17.965 --> 54:20.134
Yeah, it was up a nun's vagina.

54:20.885 --> 54:22.804
You didn't... You didn't rinse it?

54:22.887 --> 54:24.347
Yeah, I sprayed it with Windex,

54:24.431 --> 54:27.809
especially the microchip part
with all the information on it.

54:29.602 --> 54:31.187
Get in touch with Crystal Burset.

54:31.270 --> 54:33.398
She's got an open case against MCC.

54:34.566 --> 54:36.943
Danny, do not mention my name to anyone.

54:37.610 --> 54:40.488
Big J finally joined the Resistance.

54:40.572 --> 54:41.781
I've done no such thing.

54:41.864 --> 54:45.785
In fact, this meeting
never fuckin' happened, okay?

54:45.868 --> 54:47.537
It's a cool shirt. Can I, uh--

54:47.620 --> 54:48.746
No.

54:51.248 --> 54:54.043
Tell Linda the Sea Witch I said hi.

54:54.126 --> 54:55.294
Sorry.

55:02.051 --> 55:03.177
[indistinct chatter]

55:15.189 --> 55:17.066
You think I'm blind?

55:17.149 --> 55:18.651
It's a granola bar.

55:19.235 --> 55:20.612
You heard Piscatella, no food.

55:20.695 --> 55:24.115
I am not gonna stand by
while somebody starves to death.

55:25.867 --> 55:28.202
So give me four shots, or whatever,
make me crawl back to my bunk.

55:30.580 --> 55:31.789
Fuck the shots.

55:32.957 --> 55:34.083
Get up on the table.

55:34.166 --> 55:35.502
Excuse me?

55:35.585 --> 55:38.505
You heard me.
Up there with her.

55:38.588 --> 55:39.756
[laughs]

55:55.271 --> 55:56.814
What do you do when you have
to go to the bathroom?

55:58.816 --> 55:59.984
You go.

56:05.197 --> 56:08.993
Your scent is... strong.

56:11.954 --> 56:13.122
Breathe through your mouth.

56:17.627 --> 56:19.003
[clears throat]

56:24.383 --> 56:27.637
Sir, we, uh, got a situation here.

56:27.720 --> 56:29.639
I have a situation myself.

56:29.722 --> 56:32.475
You're gonna have to hold down
the fort, big man. Out.

56:34.310 --> 56:35.562
I'm sorry, what snag?

56:35.645 --> 56:39.023
Oh, we wanted to run the sewer line
straight out to the street,

56:39.106 --> 56:41.776
but there's a massive shelf of bedrock
sittin' in the way.

56:41.859 --> 56:43.402
So, what does that mean?

56:43.486 --> 56:45.279
Well, we could dynamite the whole thing.

56:47.449 --> 56:49.701
Or we could run the line
the other way around

56:49.784 --> 56:51.410
and connect it to the outtake over here.

56:51.494 --> 56:54.664
Of course, that means going straight
through the garden and the greenhouse,

56:54.747 --> 56:56.165
which we've been tryin' to avoid.

56:57.333 --> 56:58.501
What did Caputo say?

56:58.585 --> 57:00.712
He hasn't picked up his phone all morning.

57:01.504 --> 57:02.547
Okay.

57:05.467 --> 57:07.343
All right, I'm calling it, then.

57:07.426 --> 57:09.053
No more garden and greenhouse.

57:09.136 --> 57:10.346
Do it.

57:11.473 --> 57:12.682
[sighs]

57:40.292 --> 57:43.295
Hold up! Hold up!
There's something there!

57:47.258 --> 57:49.135
Oh, this ain't gonna be pretty.

57:52.639 --> 57:54.348
[coughs]

58:07.612 --> 58:08.863
[exclaims]

58:10.532 --> 58:13.117
[vomits]

58:13.200 --> 58:14.410
[coughing]

58:14.494 --> 58:16.245
[upbeat music playing]
