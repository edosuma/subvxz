01:23.390 --> 01:24.598
Hey, hey.

01:25.140 --> 01:26.182
Hello.

01:26.557 --> 01:28.182
<i>So, you didn't even bother to call.</i>

01:29.640 --> 01:32.015
<i>You gonna come tomorrow, or not?</i>

01:33.140 --> 01:35.348
I'm sorry, it's been a busy week.

01:36.640 --> 01:38.765
Fired Sambi, and Esther's...

01:39.265 --> 01:41.765
I have a vet coming tomorrow, so it's...

01:41.848 --> 01:44.807
<i>Baby, go to your room.</i>
<i>I'll be there in two minutes.</i>

01:45.723 --> 01:48.140
<i>Well, I didn't tell Lucas</i>
<i>you were coming anyway,</i>

01:48.223 --> 01:51.932
<i>but if you change your mind,</i>
<i>you can take the train down.</i>

01:52.223 --> 01:55.640
<i>You don't have to drive.</i>
<i>I can pick you up, and you can stay here.</i>

01:56.265 --> 01:58.348
<i>You know, he doesn't have school</i>
<i>on Monday.</i>

01:58.432 --> 02:00.973
- I'll try to get there tomorrow night.
<i>- All right.</i>

02:01.890 --> 02:03.223
<i>Good night, Dad.</i>

03:45.348 --> 03:46.390
Hey, Howie.

03:46.848 --> 03:48.265
What's the matter, boy?

03:51.182 --> 03:52.515
I know how you feel.

03:52.848 --> 03:55.223
But I had to get up today, too,
and so do you.

03:56.015 --> 03:57.057
Yeah.

03:59.265 --> 04:01.557
Now, you're gonna be all right, baby.

04:04.640 --> 04:06.932
Howie, come on, baby. All right.

04:07.015 --> 04:08.390
Spread those cheeks, okay?

04:09.390 --> 04:10.432
Yeah.

04:18.223 --> 04:19.265
Come on.

04:22.557 --> 04:23.598
Yeah, boy.

04:24.557 --> 04:28.557
<i>In the news,</i>
<i>in Moreno Valley and San Bernardino...</i>

04:35.557 --> 04:36.598
Shit.

04:51.098 --> 04:52.932
All right, buddy.

04:59.890 --> 05:00.932
Mr. Eubanks.

05:02.807 --> 05:04.973
- Yeah.
- I'm Theodore Lindon

05:07.682 --> 05:09.557
from US Southern Bank and Trust.
Remember me?

05:09.640 --> 05:10.932
Yeah, of course, of course.

05:12.723 --> 05:14.390
I know we said 11:00 a.m.,

05:14.473 --> 05:17.348
but my GPS thinks I'm an old lady,
it told me three hours,

05:17.432 --> 05:18.932
- it only took me one.
- Yeah.

05:19.682 --> 05:21.265
I gotta get my boy to the vet.

05:21.598 --> 05:23.015
I'll be back before 10:00.

05:23.098 --> 05:27.432
Mr. Eubanks, nobody at US Southern
wants this to go to court.

05:29.390 --> 05:30.432
Wait for me.

05:31.182 --> 05:32.223
All right?

05:33.182 --> 05:35.283
- Less than an hour. I'll be right back.
- Mr. Eubanks, please...

05:35.307 --> 05:37.432
We can talk then, okay?

06:35.515 --> 06:36.640
All right, okay.

06:36.973 --> 06:40.057
We'll stop as soon as we cross the border,
okay, boy?

06:52.557 --> 06:54.140
We're in Mexico, boy.

07:02.640 --> 07:03.682
Shit.

07:05.015 --> 07:06.057
Goddamn.

07:20.057 --> 07:22.723
Remember, never get old, buddy.

07:23.557 --> 07:26.098
Your dick shrinks to
miniscule proportions,

07:26.182 --> 07:30.098
and you can't even pee standing up
without making a mess.

07:53.765 --> 07:54.890
<i>Pull over.</i>

07:56.057 --> 07:57.223
<i>Pull over.</i>

08:11.932 --> 08:12.973
Shit.

08:15.723 --> 08:17.223
They're California plates.

08:20.723 --> 08:22.563
- Good morning, Officer.
- Your registration...

08:24.682 --> 08:26.057
What's that smell?

08:27.723 --> 08:29.557
I'm delivering a hog.

08:30.348 --> 08:31.390
In a minivan?

08:32.307 --> 08:33.640
That's correct, yes.

08:33.722 --> 08:34.932
And where are you taking him?

08:35.597 --> 08:37.640
- Jalisco.
- Jalisco?

08:37.722 --> 08:38.765
Yeah, <i>sí.</i>

08:39.390 --> 08:40.557
Show me your permit.

08:42.057 --> 08:43.557
- My what?
- Step out, please.

08:48.890 --> 08:50.723
Show me your A19, please.

08:51.057 --> 08:52.265
I'm sorry.

08:52.723 --> 08:55.890
Your A19, your permit to transport
livestock on Mexican highway.

08:56.848 --> 08:58.390
- That... Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:00.223 --> 09:01.557
Sure, I have that.

09:05.223 --> 09:06.890
I must have left it at home.

09:07.390 --> 09:09.723
Is there any way we can work this out?

09:19.057 --> 09:20.765
- Let me help you.
- What's that mean?

09:22.015 --> 09:24.557
It's a commission they charge
for taking out cash.

09:25.598 --> 09:27.390
Fucking banks, they're such crooks.

09:27.473 --> 09:28.890
You don't have to tell me that.

09:29.390 --> 09:32.307
So, Mr. Eubanks,
the charge is 6,000 pesos.

09:32.807 --> 09:35.057
This is the maximum. Do you agree?

09:35.765 --> 09:37.390
- Take what you need, man.
- Okay.

09:39.015 --> 09:40.057
There you go.

09:44.598 --> 09:47.223
- Let's go back to your pig.
- All right. Thank you.

09:51.848 --> 09:55.140
Look, here you have a little town
with a stream,

09:55.223 --> 09:57.557
it's all made of adobe.
You're gonna love it.

09:58.182 --> 10:00.723
Thanks, man, but I don't think
I'll have the time to visit.

10:01.682 --> 10:03.223
Okay, well, keep the map.

10:03.307 --> 10:04.640
- Maybe next time.
- Yeah.

10:06.598 --> 10:07.640
Nice meeting you.

10:08.223 --> 10:09.303
- You're all set.
<i>- Gracias.</i>

10:09.557 --> 10:10.807
- Drive safe.
- All right.

10:11.932 --> 10:12.973
Let's go.

10:15.223 --> 10:17.932
- Did the pig behave?
- Better than my kids.

10:18.432 --> 10:20.473
I'm gonna send them to him,
so they learn to behave.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.015
Come on, boy, go to sleep.

10:43.932 --> 10:46.973
We've got a lot of driving to do.

10:47.057 --> 10:48.390
Come on, go to sleep.

11:44.057 --> 11:46.473
Come on, here's a drink. Okay?

11:49.640 --> 11:50.682
It's good for you.

11:52.348 --> 11:54.473
Good for you, yeah.

11:56.890 --> 11:58.890
You don't wanna drink alone?

12:00.223 --> 12:01.265
Okay.

12:02.098 --> 12:03.640
I'll join you.

12:05.057 --> 12:06.557
You don't have to twist my arm.

12:40.682 --> 12:41.932
The card was declined.

12:42.015 --> 12:43.640
- What?
- Refused.

13:08.598 --> 13:09.640
Okay.

13:13.182 --> 13:16.432
Come here. I know you don't like it.
I didn't like it either.

13:16.890 --> 13:19.390
My momma had to chase me
around the farm to get it done.

13:19.807 --> 13:20.848
Put me in the bucket.

13:22.307 --> 13:23.390
Look how good you look.

13:26.557 --> 13:27.598
Man.

13:30.348 --> 13:34.265
I'll tell you, down here, they don't waste
one single part of the pig.

13:35.057 --> 13:37.640
This is a <i>gordita de moronga.</i>

13:39.098 --> 13:40.140
Pig's blood.

13:42.015 --> 13:43.640
I would give you a taste,

13:44.390 --> 13:47.890
but I don't want you
turning into a vampire, or something.

14:31.348 --> 14:32.390
Shit.

14:33.390 --> 14:34.432
Yeah.

15:29.973 --> 15:31.015
<i>Hello.</i>

15:32.223 --> 15:33.265
<i>Dad?</i>

15:35.598 --> 15:36.640
<i>Are you okay?</i>

16:11.890 --> 16:12.932
<i>Dad?</i>

16:17.390 --> 16:18.890
<i>Dad, I can hear you.</i>

16:21.390 --> 16:22.473
<i>Ambrose...</i>

16:24.473 --> 16:26.557
<i>What the hell is going on, Dad?</i>

16:27.223 --> 16:28.265
<i>Dad?</i>

16:58.348 --> 17:01.557
This is the La Leano Farm, right?

17:02.473 --> 17:04.223
<i>- Señor</i> Ambrose?
- Yes.

17:05.015 --> 17:07.182
Come in. Let him through!

17:19.015 --> 17:20.432
Come on, we're here, boy.

17:21.057 --> 17:22.557
Get you some fresh air here.

17:25.223 --> 17:27.057
Yeah.

17:34.890 --> 17:35.932
Ambrose.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.265
My, you look the same.

17:40.057 --> 17:42.098
Changed a little bit, here and there.

17:42.223 --> 17:43.348
It's so good to see you.

17:44.098 --> 17:46.015
- Good, good, good, good.
- Hey.

17:46.390 --> 17:48.015
So, where is he?

17:48.182 --> 17:50.098
Yeah, here he is, right here.

17:52.432 --> 17:54.515
- Where's your staff?
- I'm by myself.

17:54.890 --> 17:55.932
You drove here...

17:56.307 --> 17:57.807
I told you he was a little crazy.

17:57.890 --> 18:00.182
Look how gorgeous you are.

18:00.682 --> 18:02.015
Hey, how is Eunice?

18:02.098 --> 18:03.598
- She's good. Good.
- Yeah?

18:03.682 --> 18:05.265
She's all grown up like you, Payo.

18:05.890 --> 18:08.807
Payo, it's been years
since anybody called me like that.

18:08.890 --> 18:10.848
You know, they call me "Mr. Calayo" now.

18:12.973 --> 18:14.182
Good.

18:15.057 --> 18:16.098
- You're hungry?
- Yeah.

18:19.557 --> 18:21.723
You remember
what my father hated the most?

18:22.557 --> 18:24.640
Yeah. Mariachis.

18:24.723 --> 18:25.765
Well, yeah, that, too.

18:26.223 --> 18:27.265
But no, no, no.

18:28.223 --> 18:30.307
You know, sending his animals
to the slaughterhouse,

18:30.390 --> 18:32.057
and the way they were treated over there.

18:32.265 --> 18:34.140
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well...

18:35.473 --> 18:37.140
We finally built our own.

18:37.765 --> 18:40.723
We can kill 1,000 hogs
in an eight-hour shift,

18:40.807 --> 18:42.807
and we can manage two shifts a day.

18:43.390 --> 18:46.057
So, we're very happy about that.

18:47.223 --> 18:50.848
We're the only facility
that has a certificate to export.

18:51.515 --> 18:53.723
These ones, for example.

18:55.557 --> 18:57.223
These ones are going to China.

19:01.057 --> 19:02.223
Are you okay?

19:05.682 --> 19:07.223
Man, I'm sorry. What am I thinking?

19:07.307 --> 19:09.015
You must be starving. Let's...

19:09.098 --> 19:11.848
Why don't we go back to the ranch,
get you something to eat?

19:14.182 --> 19:17.140
To tell you the truth,
I'd rather have something to drink.

19:17.598 --> 19:19.265
Okay, we can manage that.

19:19.557 --> 19:20.598
- All right.
- Let's go.

19:33.140 --> 19:36.015
...to get it to the house
to get it slaughtered, you know?

19:36.515 --> 19:38.682
Boy, I'll never forget that. I can't...

19:38.807 --> 19:40.557
It's always the same.

19:41.015 --> 19:43.057
You were hugging them...

19:43.307 --> 19:44.723
That's so sweet.

19:44.807 --> 19:46.348
I became a drunk because of it.

19:47.515 --> 19:48.557
Cheers to that.

19:51.515 --> 19:52.848
My dad was the same.

19:53.390 --> 19:55.807
I mean, not a drunk. He... No, no.

19:55.890 --> 19:59.390
He just couldn't sleep the night before
we sent the hogs to the slaughterhouse.

20:00.473 --> 20:03.932
I mean, these guys were different.
They were creators of life.

20:05.307 --> 20:07.140
Your dad was a good man, Payo.

20:10.473 --> 20:13.515
It's sad to see that he's no longer here.

20:13.598 --> 20:14.640
- Yeah, well...
- Yeah.

20:14.723 --> 20:16.640
- He's gone, but not forgotten.
- Yeah.

20:16.973 --> 20:18.307
You're gonna love this.

20:18.432 --> 20:20.390
These guys were geniuses.

20:20.473 --> 20:22.473
You know,
they basically invented a new breed?

20:22.557 --> 20:23.890
Yeah, yeah.

20:23.973 --> 20:25.848
A very special <i>duro,</i> hybrid.

20:27.598 --> 20:29.348
And you're gonna love this, Ambrose.

20:29.432 --> 20:30.848
This is Marvin.

20:30.932 --> 20:33.682
Marvin won all the ribbons a hog can win.

20:34.140 --> 20:38.307
And yesterday, this guy left California
in a van, by himself,

20:38.390 --> 20:40.848
with the last direct descendent of Marvin.

20:44.057 --> 20:45.098
Marvin.

20:46.348 --> 20:47.390
Old fella.

20:48.057 --> 20:49.390
Good memories.

20:50.223 --> 20:52.723
Man. Good memories.

20:52.807 --> 20:54.932
How old were you guys there?
What, you were 25?

20:55.015 --> 20:57.140
Well, we were somewhere... Maturing.

21:03.473 --> 21:04.973
My friend.

21:06.598 --> 21:08.598
You didn't change the office one bit.

21:09.223 --> 21:10.265
Not one bit.

21:11.557 --> 21:13.265
Even the spider webs are the same.

21:17.890 --> 21:21.390
I still think it's very crazy
to drive around with this kind of cash.

21:21.723 --> 21:23.015
- Let me write you a check.
- No.

21:23.098 --> 21:24.140
Come on, please.

21:24.765 --> 21:27.390
I prefer the bank stay out of this, okay?

21:28.223 --> 21:29.598
- Okay.
- Yeah.

21:30.723 --> 21:31.765
Just be extra careful.

21:32.557 --> 21:33.973
It's a different Mexico than you...

21:34.057 --> 21:36.307
Yeah, don't worry.

21:37.765 --> 21:38.932
I know my ways.

21:41.390 --> 21:42.765
I forgot to tell you.

21:43.307 --> 21:45.057
He's not good with baths.

21:45.140 --> 21:47.473
You're gonna have to tie him down.
He's a runner.

21:49.223 --> 21:53.057
Give him a cereal bar. He loves treats.

21:53.598 --> 21:54.949
- All right?
- Good, man. Yeah, sure.

21:54.973 --> 21:57.515
Look, you're not
leaving right now, are you?

21:58.182 --> 22:00.262
No, no. You just got here.
You're spending the night.

22:02.557 --> 22:03.598
Easy, friend.

22:04.682 --> 22:07.557
I mean, it's white tequila, but it's pink.

22:08.015 --> 22:09.057
Isn't it cool?

22:09.765 --> 22:10.932
Real cool.

22:12.473 --> 22:14.182
- Pour me another one.
- No, no!

22:15.307 --> 22:17.515
- That's for women.
- All right.

22:17.598 --> 22:19.890
Okay, I'm gonna give you
a taste of the real stuff.

22:21.557 --> 22:23.307
Ambrose, a quick question.

22:24.390 --> 22:28.973
Is it true that, "Once you go black,
you never go back"?

22:41.640 --> 22:43.973
Now, this is the real stuff.

22:44.057 --> 22:48.015
This is from the Calayo family
secret stash, my friend.

22:48.390 --> 22:50.765
And you know
we keep the best for ourselves.

22:54.682 --> 22:55.723
Cheers.

22:59.973 --> 23:01.015
How's that?

23:11.307 --> 23:14.723
That's classic, Mr. Pig.
That's classic, Mr. Pig.

23:15.723 --> 23:16.765
Why, "Mr. Pig"?

23:16.848 --> 23:18.390
That's how we call him, Mr. Pig.

23:18.557 --> 23:21.515
- Yeah, it was Chila, right?
- Yeah, damn Chila.

23:22.682 --> 23:25.223
There was an Aujeszky epidemic
at the hog fair, so...

23:26.057 --> 23:29.223
I mean, nobody knew which hog
was the patient zero, as they say,

23:29.307 --> 23:31.432
so they were going to
sacrifice all of them

23:31.515 --> 23:36.307
until my friend here came,
and he checked every single hog

23:36.390 --> 23:37.473
until he found the one.

23:37.765 --> 23:39.848
- How did you do it?
- He talked to them.

23:40.057 --> 23:41.390
- No.
- Yeah, he talked to them.

23:42.265 --> 23:44.932
No, no. No, it wasn't the talking.

23:45.515 --> 23:46.557
It's listening.

23:47.557 --> 23:48.598
I was listening to them.

23:48.932 --> 23:50.432
He became the hero of the fair.

23:50.515 --> 23:54.307
I mean, all the farmers were
offering their animals to him,

23:54.390 --> 23:55.848
and some, even their daughters.

23:55.932 --> 23:56.973
Remember?

23:57.557 --> 23:59.140
Not a good breed.

23:59.765 --> 24:01.557
- I like that.
- And when in Rome.

24:01.640 --> 24:03.640
You had your eye on Brianda, remember?

24:04.140 --> 24:06.973
Yeah, no, Brianda, I mean,
she was this young singer.

24:07.723 --> 24:10.515
Brianda was flirting with him
in front of the whole <i>palenque.</i>

24:10.598 --> 24:12.057
I mean, everybody was there.

24:12.182 --> 24:15.057
And my dad,
he was trying to save his ass, right?

24:15.682 --> 24:17.265
So, he keeps telling Ambrose,

24:17.348 --> 24:21.390
"Hey, no, Brianda is the mistress of

24:21.848 --> 24:24.015
- "the <i>presidente municipal..."</i>
- No, no.

24:24.932 --> 24:27.723
Brianda was your father's mistress.

24:28.390 --> 24:32.723
But because your mother,
God rest her soul, was there,

24:33.098 --> 24:38.973
he came up with
this <i>presidente</i> mistress story.

24:45.848 --> 24:47.848
What did you do? What happened?

24:49.473 --> 24:51.390
She came back to the hotel with me.

24:52.640 --> 24:53.973
Did you know about this?

24:54.057 --> 24:56.390
Calayo was really mad at me.

24:56.473 --> 24:58.265
We didn't talk for a year.

25:00.348 --> 25:01.390
Eventually, we made up.

25:02.348 --> 25:03.390
I'm going to sleep.

25:03.723 --> 25:04.765
Good night.

25:04.973 --> 25:06.973
You make yourself at home.

25:20.182 --> 25:21.640
- I gotta go.
- Night-night.

25:21.723 --> 25:22.807
Good night, Ambrose.

25:23.390 --> 25:25.182
Night-night.

25:29.932 --> 25:30.973
<i>Chila.</i>

25:31.390 --> 25:34.557
<i>It's done. I got the money.</i>

25:35.723 --> 25:38.390
Yeah, this kid held his word.

25:39.598 --> 25:41.098
I'll get there on Thursday.

25:41.223 --> 25:44.432
Call Brianda, and Ermilo, and everybody.

25:45.890 --> 25:49.557
We're gonna have one last party
like in the day.

26:05.932 --> 26:09.390
Before I leave,
can I say goodbye to my hog?

26:11.390 --> 26:12.432
Of course.

27:30.807 --> 27:32.473
These are the big boys.

27:38.557 --> 27:40.390
This is where Howie is gonna live.

27:41.473 --> 27:42.515
Antibiotics?

27:42.890 --> 27:44.890
Without them,
they will get sick in a minute.

27:45.765 --> 27:48.223
Because this is not
the right way to raise them!

27:48.307 --> 27:49.890
- This is the future...
- No, it's not!

27:51.223 --> 27:52.265
Ambrose.

27:53.390 --> 27:54.432
Ambrose!

27:56.223 --> 27:57.473
Calm down, Ambrose.

28:07.723 --> 28:09.515
Come on, Ambrose!

28:17.682 --> 28:23.598
PROPER
WORK ATTIRE REQUIRED

28:24.057 --> 28:26.857
He says they can't get it out of
the truck. The pig is being difficult.

28:26.932 --> 28:29.140
Tell him to use the stick, damn it.
They aren't rookies.

28:29.307 --> 28:31.283
Use the stick. You are acting
like rookies, dumbasses.

28:31.307 --> 28:32.366
I told them to quarantine it.

28:32.390 --> 28:35.473
The old man wants to see it,
and we have to give him the truck back.

28:35.557 --> 28:37.640
It's urgent that you quarantine it.

28:39.390 --> 28:40.640
Hello.

28:40.723 --> 28:42.473
Where's my hog?

28:43.432 --> 28:44.598
Is Payo here?

28:45.182 --> 28:46.723
Hey, Ambrose, my friend.

28:47.307 --> 28:49.027
How was your shower?
Are you feeling better?

28:49.223 --> 28:50.265
I need to see my hog.

28:51.140 --> 28:52.182
Your hog?

28:53.723 --> 28:54.765
Where is he?

29:00.432 --> 29:01.473
Give me a second.

29:02.682 --> 29:03.932
Hey, hey, hey, stop it!

29:04.390 --> 29:05.432
Hey, stop it!

29:06.640 --> 29:08.182
Stop it, hey, give me this.

29:09.182 --> 29:10.557
Come here. Come on.

29:11.848 --> 29:14.348
It's all right, Howie.
It's my fault. Come on.

29:16.223 --> 29:17.265
So...

29:18.473 --> 29:19.848
You wanna know how it feels?

29:22.223 --> 29:24.348
- You like it?
- Calm down.

29:24.432 --> 29:25.473
You like it?

29:25.557 --> 29:28.033
Calm down. Get away or I will fuck you up!
I am going to fuck you up! Help me, man!

29:28.057 --> 29:29.640
You want some of it, too?

29:29.723 --> 29:31.098
You wanna feel how it feels?

29:31.932 --> 29:33.348
Hey, you want some of this?

29:36.057 --> 29:37.640
Calm down, man. Let's talk about this.

29:37.723 --> 29:39.140
No, no, this is wrong!

29:39.557 --> 29:41.765
Ambrose, that's the way it's done now.

29:41.890 --> 29:43.390
Okay? Just, let's talk about it.

29:43.473 --> 29:45.557
That's bullshit, man! It's bullshit!

29:46.307 --> 29:47.348
The deal is off.

29:47.723 --> 29:49.283
- What?
- Yeah, the fucking deal is off.

29:49.307 --> 29:50.307
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

29:50.390 --> 29:53.557
'Cause nobody here is gonna pay you
$50,000 for that hog, okay?

29:53.848 --> 29:55.574
I was just doing you a favor
because of my dad!

29:55.598 --> 29:58.807
Yeah. I don't need your damn money.

29:59.098 --> 30:02.057
And I don't need any favors
from a cock-ass like you.

30:02.307 --> 30:03.366
Why don't you go fuck yourself?

30:03.390 --> 30:04.432
No, no, fuck you, then!

30:04.515 --> 30:06.033
- Go fuck yourself!
- Why don't you fuck yourself?

30:06.057 --> 30:07.557
- Go fuck yourself!
- Fuck yourself!

30:07.723 --> 30:08.890
- Fuck yourself!
- Fuck you!

30:08.973 --> 30:11.140
You don't fucking know shit
about raising pigs.

30:11.223 --> 30:12.307
Don't know shit.

30:12.390 --> 30:14.140
Your father would be damn ashamed of you.

30:14.390 --> 30:15.598
Fucking shit!

30:15.682 --> 30:16.723
Come on, boy.

30:17.432 --> 30:19.057
Fuck it. Fuck!

30:47.057 --> 30:48.223
Another gringo, I see.

30:52.973 --> 30:55.682
I'd offer you a smoke,
but all I got is this thing.

30:56.848 --> 30:57.890
It's okay.

30:59.557 --> 31:00.598
It works.

31:03.265 --> 31:05.432
- That yours?
- Yep.

31:09.182 --> 31:12.057
- You're a farmer?
- Hog farmer.

31:24.223 --> 31:27.473
I'm a physicist. I build clean rooms.

31:29.223 --> 31:30.890
Put one together here for a factory.

31:33.348 --> 31:34.515
Clean room?

31:34.598 --> 31:39.307
Yeah. A room with minimal dust,
microbes, aerosol...

31:39.432 --> 31:41.515
You know, all the stuff that's everywhere.

31:43.932 --> 31:45.640
You want a beer?

31:45.723 --> 31:47.098
Brought my own.

31:56.598 --> 32:00.057
You gonna be sticking around a while?
I'm here for another 21 days.

32:03.223 --> 32:04.640
Lucky you.

32:08.932 --> 32:10.223
I don't know.

32:13.765 --> 32:15.057
That's a big one.

32:24.223 --> 32:25.390
I'm through.

32:28.723 --> 32:29.807
I'm...

32:33.265 --> 32:37.015
Imagine spending all of your life

32:38.057 --> 32:43.765
in a little four-by-six-foot pen,

32:46.598 --> 32:49.432
and not even get...
Being able to see the sun.

32:53.723 --> 32:54.932
That's our life.

32:55.890 --> 33:01.473
Getting fatter in a bigger pen,
and dying a little later.

33:13.890 --> 33:15.848
<i>You have to be honest with me, all right?</i>

33:16.348 --> 33:18.848
<i>Why didn't you tell me you lost the farm?</i>

33:19.057 --> 33:20.515
I don't wanna be a burden.

33:21.057 --> 33:25.015
<i>Come, stay with us for a while.</i>
<i>We'll try to figure all of this out.</i>

33:25.098 --> 33:30.723
I just... Wanna just
get things straight, okay?

33:31.057 --> 33:33.057
<i>How long have you been living like that?</i>

33:34.223 --> 33:37.973
<i>Why didn't you tell me about it?</i>
<i>Why do you keep lying to me?</i>

33:38.848 --> 33:40.307
I don't wanna hurt you.

33:40.973 --> 33:42.598
<i>Payo told me about your little trip.</i>

33:42.723 --> 33:44.473
What? What did that prick tell you?

33:44.723 --> 33:46.432
<i>He told me you're going crazy.</i>

33:47.223 --> 33:50.307
I'm okay! I'm okay!

33:50.390 --> 33:52.223
I want you to be okay.

33:53.348 --> 33:55.307
I want everybody to be okay.

33:55.390 --> 33:57.390
<i>I want you to stop drinking.</i>

34:01.015 --> 34:02.199
- All right. I don't...
<i>- Dad...</i>

34:02.223 --> 34:05.973
<i>Dad, there's no way you can</i>
<i>drive yourself back like that, okay?</i>

34:06.057 --> 34:07.682
<i>Just wait for me in San Miguel,</i>

34:07.765 --> 34:10.389
<i>and we will drive back together,</i>
<i>all right? Dad...</i>

34:33.973 --> 34:37.056
Hey! I'll give you twenty for your hog.

34:38.348 --> 34:40.181
Twenty for the pig.

34:51.264 --> 34:53.806
- How much for your cow?
- Fourteen thousand.

34:54.681 --> 34:56.764
Fourteen thousand pesos
for this mangy old cow?

34:56.848 --> 34:58.348
No, kid, I'll give you ten.

34:58.557 --> 35:00.057
My uncle says 14.

35:00.640 --> 35:02.000
Tell your uncle it's going to die.

35:02.765 --> 35:03.807
There you go.

35:04.557 --> 35:06.057
Get your hide all soft.

35:08.390 --> 35:10.057
How much for the hog?

35:11.848 --> 35:12.890
Come again?

35:13.890 --> 35:15.432
How much for the pig?

35:16.723 --> 35:17.890
50,000.

35:18.723 --> 35:19.890
50,000 pesos?

35:21.223 --> 35:23.182
Dollars. American dollars.

35:29.348 --> 35:32.557
Never mind him, Howard.
He doesn't know shit from Shinola.

35:32.890 --> 35:33.932
Moron.

35:34.557 --> 35:35.765
Fucking old moron.

36:00.307 --> 36:01.348
Howard!

36:03.348 --> 36:04.390
Boy.

36:05.598 --> 36:06.640
Shit.

36:06.723 --> 36:07.807
Get away.

36:11.057 --> 36:13.015
You didn't even try your food, Howard.

36:13.098 --> 36:14.223
Hey, bless you.

36:19.265 --> 36:21.973
Come on, boy.
Come on, it's all right, boy.

36:22.598 --> 36:24.890
It's all right. It's all right.

36:30.348 --> 36:33.932
Shit, it's that rain and all that damn...
That damn farm!

36:34.057 --> 36:37.432
I'm sorry, Howie. I'm sorry. Come on, boy.

36:39.057 --> 36:40.098
I'm sorry.

36:41.557 --> 36:43.390
I'm sorry, pig. Come on.

36:47.265 --> 36:48.307
Okay.

36:57.557 --> 37:00.057
My friend is sick. I just...

37:02.682 --> 37:03.848
Nice talking to you.

37:05.557 --> 37:07.223
Come on. Come on.

37:11.098 --> 37:12.223
Just a minute.

37:19.390 --> 37:21.390
Howard, not here, boy.

37:25.640 --> 37:26.682
Shit.

37:27.640 --> 37:28.682
Come on.

37:35.765 --> 37:40.598
I may not have a vet degree,
but I got your back.

37:41.723 --> 37:44.432
I've done this plenty of times.
Plenty of times.

37:47.807 --> 37:48.848
Good.

37:50.348 --> 37:51.390
Okay, Howie.

37:52.307 --> 37:57.098
You may see some weird stuff,
but don't be afraid. All right?

37:58.140 --> 37:59.182
Here you go.

37:59.932 --> 38:02.723
Okay. All right, just relax. Just breathe.

38:02.890 --> 38:04.557
Howard... Yeah, like that.

38:06.098 --> 38:10.348
Okay. Okay, boy. Okay. Yeah. Okay.

38:10.557 --> 38:11.598
There you go.

38:26.098 --> 38:27.140
Dad?

38:31.848 --> 38:33.432
Dad, it's me, Eunice. Open up.

38:40.890 --> 38:42.932
Dad, it's me, Eunice. Open up.

38:46.557 --> 38:47.640
Door's open.

38:53.973 --> 38:55.098
What the hell?

38:57.682 --> 38:59.682
Why is there a hog in your motel room?

39:01.265 --> 39:02.348
What are you doing here?

39:04.848 --> 39:06.057
I'm looking for you.

39:08.223 --> 39:09.307
Close the door.

39:17.140 --> 39:18.182
Is he sick?

39:18.557 --> 39:19.682
He'll be just fine.

39:22.557 --> 39:24.140
What's the matter with you?

39:27.140 --> 39:28.182
How could you just...

39:30.390 --> 39:33.057
- Look...
- How could you just take off like that?

39:36.473 --> 39:38.223
I'm busy, okay?

39:38.890 --> 39:43.182
Look, so if you wanna help, help me.

39:44.390 --> 39:45.848
If not, quit bothering me.

39:50.223 --> 39:51.307
Well...

39:58.098 --> 40:00.723
Steady. Yeah, right, that's right.

40:01.182 --> 40:02.265
Right there.

40:06.890 --> 40:07.932
Give me that.

40:10.182 --> 40:11.223
Let me help you.

40:11.515 --> 40:15.390
Howie, now, it's all right, boy.
It's all right.

40:17.640 --> 40:18.723
No, no, no, no.

40:18.807 --> 40:19.949
- Right there. Right there.
- I know. I know.

40:19.973 --> 40:21.848
I've drained water from lungs before.

40:22.557 --> 40:24.432
You better hurry up.

40:26.682 --> 40:27.723
Good boy.

40:29.515 --> 40:30.557
Good boy.

40:30.723 --> 40:32.783
I'll take it. I'll take it from here.
I'll take it from here.

40:32.807 --> 40:33.807
Okay.

40:33.890 --> 40:35.890
Okay. Yeah.

40:36.640 --> 40:38.932
Hey, get that vase, okay?

40:39.973 --> 40:41.890
- Get that vase over there.
- Got it.

40:43.473 --> 40:46.015
Yeah. Yeah.

40:48.223 --> 40:50.557
Good boy. Good boy.

40:51.265 --> 40:52.807
You're gonna be fine.

40:54.015 --> 40:58.182
Howie, you're gonna be fine, boy.
You're gonna be fine. Good boy.

41:15.015 --> 41:16.057
Hey.

41:17.098 --> 41:18.223
Hey, boy.

41:20.515 --> 41:21.598
Look at you.

41:23.432 --> 41:25.807
Come on, like a champ.

41:27.015 --> 41:29.098
Boy, it all finished.

41:39.057 --> 41:40.515
You like that TV show?

41:41.890 --> 41:43.473
I'll get this in you, yeah?

41:44.223 --> 41:46.973
Yeah. We do this,

41:47.057 --> 41:50.515
and you're gonna be like brand-new, baby.

41:51.557 --> 41:53.765
Yeah. Here.

42:05.265 --> 42:06.890
All right, come on, boy.

42:08.265 --> 42:11.515
Come on. I know you had a rough night.
Come on. Come on.

42:12.932 --> 42:14.640
There you go. Okay.

42:16.098 --> 42:19.473
You're all right. Come on, boy.
You just relax.

42:19.848 --> 42:21.057
There you go.

42:21.723 --> 42:22.973
Good morning!

42:37.765 --> 42:41.390
You know, most normal people
can rely on their parents for support.

42:42.432 --> 42:43.973
- You know...
- There we go.

42:44.557 --> 42:47.223
Things like money, or advice, or help.

42:48.640 --> 42:49.765
Not me.

42:51.515 --> 42:57.057
I have a parent who acts
more like a child than a parent.

42:58.723 --> 43:00.265
A parent that I have to support.

43:01.890 --> 43:03.557
I can take care of myself. Thanks.

43:06.098 --> 43:07.265
How is that?

43:09.557 --> 43:15.557
Ambrose, you are a penniless,
homeless, unemployed 75-year-old man.

43:16.223 --> 43:19.140
You're only focusing on my strong points.

43:20.182 --> 43:21.598
I'm glad you think this is funny.

43:22.265 --> 43:23.598
That's not fair.

43:31.348 --> 43:33.807
What is it? Are you okay?

43:54.890 --> 43:56.098
What was that? What happened?

43:56.848 --> 43:57.890
It was nothing.

43:58.557 --> 44:00.265
You just threw up, that wasn't nothing.

44:01.973 --> 44:03.515
- Yeah.
- Ambrose, are you all right?

44:03.932 --> 44:07.682
Yeah, like I said,
I can take care of myself.

44:07.848 --> 44:09.168
You don't have to worry about me.

44:09.307 --> 44:10.557
Let me help you with that.

44:11.057 --> 44:12.098
Come on.

44:12.390 --> 44:13.723
I'm worried about you.

44:16.515 --> 44:17.557
I'm okay, okay?

44:17.723 --> 44:18.973
No, you're not okay.

44:19.098 --> 44:20.866
I have to worry about you
because no one else will...

44:20.890 --> 44:22.973
Well, I don't need anyone.

44:23.057 --> 44:26.057
I didn't ask you to come here,
and I'm not asking you to stay.

44:26.223 --> 44:28.973
So, I'm fine. You can go, okay?

44:33.640 --> 44:36.640
- I can go?
- Yeah, please, get out!

44:37.723 --> 44:40.140
Okay? Get the fuck out of here!

44:46.223 --> 44:47.307
Bye.

44:53.682 --> 44:56.223
Fine. Just, fuck it.

44:57.723 --> 45:00.598
I can't stand the fucking smell in here
anymore, anyway.

45:05.557 --> 45:07.973
Now you can be alone
with your little fucking pig.

45:11.390 --> 45:13.390
Get the fuck out of my way, pig.

45:46.723 --> 45:48.515
Fucking shit-ass truck!

46:58.223 --> 46:59.265
Dad?

46:59.890 --> 47:00.973
Dad?

47:01.515 --> 47:02.557
Help!

47:39.848 --> 47:41.057
Dad, no!

47:41.182 --> 47:42.491
What are they trying to do to me?

47:42.515 --> 47:43.640
They're trying to help you.

47:44.473 --> 47:45.598
No, no!

47:46.432 --> 47:47.658
Sir! Please! You're going
to hurt yourself.

47:47.682 --> 47:48.723
Be gentle, please.

47:49.432 --> 47:50.640
Be careful, please.

47:50.932 --> 47:53.057
Okay, leave him alone. Leave him alone!

47:53.140 --> 47:54.949
- Leave me alone. Let me get out of here!
- Leave him alone.

47:54.973 --> 47:56.473
Alone. Alone.

47:56.557 --> 47:58.637
- Please?
- Eunice, what are they trying to do to me?

48:01.807 --> 48:02.848
I want to...

48:04.807 --> 48:05.848
Can you help him?

48:09.973 --> 48:13.265
Grab my shoes. Grab my shoes.
What am I doing here?

48:16.015 --> 48:18.098
No, no, I'm all right! I'm all right!
I'm all right!

48:18.432 --> 48:20.098
Leave me alone.

48:20.265 --> 48:21.557
Can you help him, please?

48:27.640 --> 48:29.265
- All right.
- Come on, Dad.

48:30.557 --> 48:32.140
- I got you. I got you.
- Okay.

48:55.223 --> 48:56.390
Let me get this.

48:57.557 --> 48:59.390
Thank you, no, here, let me help you.

49:07.223 --> 49:08.557
Why didn't you tell me?

49:09.390 --> 49:11.140
Because there's nothing to be done.

49:11.223 --> 49:13.140
Dad, that's not true.
The doctor said it was...

49:13.223 --> 49:17.890
Doctors tell you what you wanna hear.
It's their job to give you false hope.

49:23.390 --> 49:24.848
Dad, don't drink that.

49:24.932 --> 49:27.973
- Why not?
- Because you're dying.

49:28.265 --> 49:29.473
That's why I need a beer.

49:40.807 --> 49:41.848
You all right?

49:42.640 --> 49:44.360
See, Dad, you're supposed
to use this thing.

49:46.557 --> 49:49.348
What is that? Oxygen machine?

49:50.973 --> 49:52.057
Does it even work?

49:53.515 --> 49:55.515
Yeah, it works. See, look.

49:56.557 --> 49:58.640
I attached a car battery to it,

49:58.723 --> 50:00.483
so we can take it back
to the States with us.

50:01.348 --> 50:02.390
Nonsense.

50:03.223 --> 50:05.366
You know, the doctor said that
if you don't start using it,

50:05.390 --> 50:07.640
you're gonna start organ failure
much sooner.

50:07.723 --> 50:10.140
See, look at your fingers. God.

50:20.348 --> 50:21.515
Hey, Howie?

50:22.348 --> 50:24.057
- Howie?
- Shit.

50:31.015 --> 50:34.432
Damn it, Eunice! You should've
put the "do not disturb" sign.

50:34.515 --> 50:36.435
Come on, come on, come on.
You've gotta sit down.

50:37.098 --> 50:38.932
Come on. I'm bringing you to the bed.

50:39.848 --> 50:40.973
Well, I'm sorry, okay?

50:41.057 --> 50:43.973
'Cause I thought you were dead,

50:44.057 --> 50:46.640
so your hog was the furthest thing
from my mind.

50:46.723 --> 50:50.390
We're gonna breathe now, okay?
We're gonna breathe.

50:51.223 --> 50:52.703
You're just gonna need a little help.

50:53.265 --> 50:55.723
Put this in your nose,
and I want you to hold it.

50:56.307 --> 50:59.015
That's it. All you gotta do is hold it.
Let me do the rest.

51:01.223 --> 51:02.890
Don't talk, just breathe.

51:04.515 --> 51:06.223
That's it. How's that?

51:08.307 --> 51:09.307
A little less.

51:09.390 --> 51:10.598
- Little less?
- Okay.

51:10.723 --> 51:12.890
- Okay. All right, that's it. That's it.
- Okay. Okay.

51:12.973 --> 51:14.574
Okay, that's enough. Let's go get Howard.

51:14.598 --> 51:18.640
All right. Wait. We're gonna wait.
We can take two minutes.

51:21.057 --> 51:22.223
Just breathe.

51:23.432 --> 51:24.598
Okay. Okay.

51:26.432 --> 51:27.557
Maybe he is in the kitchen.

51:28.223 --> 51:29.973
Hey, Howie! Howie!

51:30.598 --> 51:32.265
Go to the back.

51:32.557 --> 51:34.598
Howie! No, no, no, let's go to reception.

51:34.682 --> 51:36.557
- Howard!
- Let's go to reception.

51:37.265 --> 51:38.473
I'll go to reception.

51:38.557 --> 51:40.957
- You need to go to the room and rest.
- No, no, no! Come on!

51:41.473 --> 51:42.640
Where's my hog?

51:43.390 --> 51:44.432
I'm sorry?

51:45.890 --> 51:48.265
My hog. The one I left in my room.

51:48.598 --> 51:49.640
Your hog, pig?

51:49.723 --> 51:50.848
Excuse me, is there a...

51:50.932 --> 51:53.807
Yeah, the one that was in my room!
Where is it?

51:53.973 --> 51:55.723
I'm sorry, you have
an animal in the hotel?

51:55.807 --> 51:57.557
- It's a very big...
- Let's go. Come on.

51:57.640 --> 51:59.449
No, you're not allowed
to have animals in the hotel.

51:59.473 --> 52:00.932
- I have a pig.
- Huge...

52:01.015 --> 52:02.491
You cannot have animals in the hotel.

52:02.515 --> 52:04.557
- Thank you.
- It's not allowed.

52:05.265 --> 52:06.348
She was watching me.

52:07.473 --> 52:09.723
Okay. Right here. All right.

52:09.807 --> 52:12.140
- Are you sure?
- Right here. Right here.

52:12.223 --> 52:13.723
Jesus.

52:14.223 --> 52:15.390
This is crazy.

52:18.223 --> 52:19.890
I don't think anybody's here.

52:21.682 --> 52:23.057
Hi, where is my hog?

52:25.182 --> 52:26.223
Dad...

52:28.973 --> 52:31.973
Howie? Where are you hiding him?

52:32.057 --> 52:35.348
- Dad. Dad, you can't do this.
- Howie... Where are you hiding him?

52:35.598 --> 52:36.949
- Dad, you can't do this.
- Okay, okay.

52:36.973 --> 52:38.158
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

52:38.182 --> 52:39.848
- What's going on here?
- I'm so sorry.

52:39.932 --> 52:41.449
- We're gonna leave. We're gonna leave.
- I lost him.

52:41.473 --> 52:43.908
- Let's go into town. You didn't lose him.
- He's not here. Oh, God.

52:43.932 --> 52:45.366
- We're gonna find him.
- You need to leave right now.

52:45.390 --> 52:47.223
Yes, we're leaving right now.
I'm very sorry.

52:47.557 --> 52:48.682
Hey, Howard!

52:50.140 --> 52:51.390
Howard! Howard!

52:51.473 --> 52:54.265
He's fine. He's just...
He's just going crazy for the hog.

52:54.348 --> 52:55.348
Howard!

52:55.432 --> 52:57.390
Yes, thank you, Payo.

52:58.432 --> 53:01.682
Hey, don't thank him!
I bet he's the one who stole him!

53:01.848 --> 53:03.848
He's helping us.
He's the reason I found you.

53:03.932 --> 53:05.015
Howard!

53:06.390 --> 53:08.182
- Howard!
- Howard!

53:09.098 --> 53:10.182
Howard!

53:18.015 --> 53:19.973
Hey, hey, stop! Stop. Stop.

53:25.473 --> 53:26.515
Dad.

53:49.390 --> 53:50.598
Is that Howard?

53:58.598 --> 53:59.640
It was for you.

54:02.057 --> 54:03.182
What?

54:06.140 --> 54:07.515
The money was for you.

54:10.057 --> 54:11.682
I wanted to leave you something.

54:16.057 --> 54:17.223
I lost him.

54:27.015 --> 54:28.182
Come on, Dad.

54:29.348 --> 54:30.473
It's time to go. Come on.

54:31.807 --> 54:32.848
Sorry, Dad.

54:48.390 --> 54:49.432
Yes, hello?

54:51.390 --> 54:52.432
Yes?

54:53.348 --> 54:54.390
Payo?

54:56.390 --> 54:57.432
Really?

54:57.848 --> 54:59.015
They found Howard.

55:00.557 --> 55:02.682
You're kidding. Where?

55:05.557 --> 55:06.598
Okay.

55:18.140 --> 55:19.182
Okay.

55:19.265 --> 55:21.848
- Fill this in and sign, please.
- Yes.

55:22.140 --> 55:24.432
I'll need your information, please.
And your signature.

55:24.515 --> 55:26.848
- My signature?
- Yes.

55:27.390 --> 55:28.432
Okay.

55:29.307 --> 55:31.557
Hey, hey, Howie.

55:31.682 --> 55:34.973
There you are, boy.
I got a treat for you. Come here, Howard.

55:35.890 --> 55:37.807
Hi, boy. Hi.

55:41.890 --> 55:44.848
You didn't join any gangs
while you were in there, did you, champ?

55:47.765 --> 55:49.015
Come here, boy.

55:49.390 --> 55:50.990
Why are you in such a hurry to get back?

55:51.015 --> 55:54.057
I know it's hard for you to understand,

55:54.140 --> 55:57.015
but some people actually enjoy
spending time with their family.

55:57.098 --> 56:00.390
And I really...
I'd really like you to come with me.

56:00.473 --> 56:05.140
Look here, Eunice, Howard can't
go back into the States, okay?

56:05.223 --> 56:08.932
It's a disease control thing.
They'll stop him at the border, okay?

56:09.015 --> 56:12.807
We need to find him a good home here
and hopefully get paid.

56:12.890 --> 56:13.890
No.

56:13.973 --> 56:15.557
Okay, okay. All right.

56:15.682 --> 56:18.098
You want to go back, okay, I understand.

56:18.223 --> 56:20.265
I'll take you to the airport.

56:20.348 --> 56:22.390
You know, I signed up
for a bunch of credit cards.

56:22.473 --> 56:25.682
I've been withdrawing all the cash.
It's yours. You take it. Here.

56:25.765 --> 56:29.057
No, I don't need money.

56:29.140 --> 56:31.390
Well, you're gonna need it
a lot more than I do.

56:31.473 --> 56:33.515
It's a lot cheaper being dead
than being alive.

56:33.598 --> 56:36.932
Dad, don't say that. Come on.

56:37.390 --> 56:38.557
Okay, okay, okay.

56:38.640 --> 56:42.098
Think of it as all the child support
payments I missed, okay?

56:42.223 --> 56:45.640
I don't need money, all right?
It's not the money.

56:45.765 --> 56:50.807
Lookit. Let's go to Guadalajara.
It's a big city.

56:50.890 --> 56:53.140
There's a better chance
to sell him there, okay?

56:53.223 --> 56:55.890
After that, we'll go back. Promise.

56:58.098 --> 56:59.223
Okay?

57:10.682 --> 57:11.723
Okay. Okay.

57:18.182 --> 57:19.973
Let's go find you a home, Howard.

57:20.640 --> 57:22.265
We're going to Guadalajara.

57:50.723 --> 57:53.807
We have to stay here.
It's a safe place for Howard.

57:54.390 --> 57:55.890
- This place?
- Yeah.

57:59.348 --> 58:00.390
Stop.

58:00.682 --> 58:01.723
Here?

58:02.390 --> 58:03.515
<i>Welcome.</i>

58:04.348 --> 58:07.807
Hello? We'd like a room, please.

58:09.348 --> 58:12.682
<i>Yes. 105 is free, go to the left.</i>

58:14.098 --> 58:15.890
- Thank you.
<i>- Welcome to the Caesars.</i>

58:16.265 --> 58:18.973
See? There, 105.

58:20.223 --> 58:22.723
Yeah, you know
your way around, Dad? Really?

58:23.348 --> 58:24.390
A little bit.

58:34.223 --> 58:36.515
- All right, Howard. All right, buddy.
- Home sweet home.

58:42.015 --> 58:43.515
- This it?
- Yeah.

58:48.223 --> 58:49.973
I'm gonna take a shower.

58:50.140 --> 58:51.182
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

58:51.598 --> 58:53.057
Okay, let me help you.

58:53.223 --> 58:55.723
No, no. Over my dead body.

58:55.848 --> 58:58.265
My mama was
the first and last woman to bathe me.

58:59.348 --> 59:00.557
Wait, you gotta leave that in.

59:01.640 --> 59:03.265
It's gonna be real quick.

59:04.057 --> 59:05.348
Ten minutes, tops.

59:07.890 --> 59:09.057
All right.

59:31.390 --> 59:32.432
I miss you, too.

59:32.807 --> 59:34.967
But I'm down here with
your grandpa for a little while.

59:36.557 --> 59:37.723
What? I don't know.

59:38.723 --> 59:43.348
I don't know. But I love you. Okay?
Put Daddy back on, all right?

59:45.432 --> 59:46.473
Hi.

59:47.890 --> 59:49.348
God. Wait...

59:50.682 --> 59:52.723
What? No.

59:53.932 --> 59:56.265
I don't know. I just... I feel like it...

59:57.223 --> 01:00:01.432
God! I'm sorry. No. God, not you.

01:00:05.057 --> 01:00:07.937
It's the middle of the school year,
you know, you should stay with Lucas.

01:00:10.848 --> 01:00:13.348
Yeah. I gotta do this by myself.

01:00:17.598 --> 01:00:19.598
<i>Uno</i> club sandwich.

01:00:21.473 --> 01:00:23.557
<i>Si,</i> club sandwich.

01:00:36.265 --> 01:00:39.390
Man. Ambrose,
you gotta take a look at this.

01:00:39.557 --> 01:00:41.390
It's like Jerry Springer on crack.

01:00:44.432 --> 01:00:45.515
Really?

01:00:46.348 --> 01:00:47.348
Fuck.

01:00:47.432 --> 01:00:48.574
Apparently, we're not that bad.

01:00:48.598 --> 01:00:50.890
That guy right there
is in love with his daughter.

01:00:52.307 --> 01:00:53.640
Put it on speaker phone for me.

01:00:54.557 --> 01:00:56.015
- Here.
- All right.

01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:57.848
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hello.

01:00:58.682 --> 01:01:01.265
This is Chila, a dear friend.

01:01:01.515 --> 01:01:04.182
She was my interpreter
on my first trip here.

01:01:04.307 --> 01:01:06.057
Nice to meet you, Chila.

01:01:07.557 --> 01:01:11.640
<i>Hello, I was telling Ambrose</i>
<i>that some old friends and me,</i>

01:01:11.932 --> 01:01:16.098
<i>we've decided to chip in and buy Howard.</i>

01:01:16.848 --> 01:01:18.640
No way, really? That's great!

01:01:18.807 --> 01:01:21.116
They're just doing that because
they're feeling sorry for me,

01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:23.223
because I'm dying and all that.
You know, whatever.

01:01:23.307 --> 01:01:25.140
It's fine to me.

01:01:25.848 --> 01:01:27.932
<i>Shut up, or the deal is off, Ambrose.</i>

01:01:28.723 --> 01:01:31.473
Chila, how far away are we
from you right now?

01:01:32.182 --> 01:01:36.098
<i>About four hours by car,</i>
<i>and then half an hour by boat.</i>

01:01:37.098 --> 01:01:38.223
By boat? Really?

01:01:39.057 --> 01:01:40.217
Howard's not gonna like that.

01:01:40.265 --> 01:01:42.140
<i>Don't worry, we will send for you both.</i>

01:01:42.223 --> 01:01:45.432
<i>Just get to Boca de Tomatlan,</i>
<i>and we'll take care of it from there.</i>

01:01:45.515 --> 01:01:48.223
<i>Ermilo will be waiting,</i>
<i>and I can ask Brianda...</i>

01:01:48.307 --> 01:01:51.973
Okay. Okay. Chila, I know. I know.

01:01:52.057 --> 01:01:55.557
Okay. Goodbye.
Okay, see you tomorrow. Okay.

01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:57.807
<i>Drive safe, bye!</i>

01:02:00.890 --> 01:02:03.807
- So we'll go first thing in the morning.
- Okay.

01:02:03.890 --> 01:02:06.640
Yeah. Yeah. Good.

01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:11.182
Don't forget to call Lucas, okay?

01:02:11.265 --> 01:02:14.098
I did when we got here.

01:02:14.182 --> 01:02:16.765
But thank you, Dad. That's...

01:02:16.848 --> 01:02:18.640
Okay.

01:02:18.723 --> 01:02:21.348
Tell him Grandpa said hello, next time.

01:02:22.557 --> 01:02:24.140
I'll do that.

01:02:28.765 --> 01:02:31.682
This beach we're headed to, it's nice?

01:02:32.598 --> 01:02:34.348
You gonna love it.

01:02:36.057 --> 01:02:39.265
Best place on the whole planet.

01:02:39.682 --> 01:02:42.598
Playa Majahuitas.

01:02:42.682 --> 01:02:46.807
I used to go there every year,
to the hog fair.

01:02:46.890 --> 01:02:51.265
Just as an excuse
to spend some time there.

01:02:51.348 --> 01:02:54.848
Great food, the nicest people.

01:03:01.973 --> 01:03:05.057
I can't believe
this is only the second night I've spent

01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:07.515
in the same room as my father.

01:03:08.307 --> 01:03:10.515
What are you talking about?

01:03:10.598 --> 01:03:16.307
Your mom and I slept with you
till you were five years old.

01:03:17.348 --> 01:03:18.890
Really?

01:03:20.182 --> 01:03:21.182
Yeah.

01:03:21.265 --> 01:03:25.473
You were afraid of the shark in <i>Jaws.</i>

01:03:25.557 --> 01:03:29.140
Cursed the day we let you watch the movie.

01:03:29.223 --> 01:03:33.098
You used to crawl in our bed
in the middle of the night

01:03:33.182 --> 01:03:39.182
and claim that you could hear
the sea getting closer and closer.

01:03:42.765 --> 01:03:44.057
Yeah.

01:03:46.557 --> 01:03:47.598
Good night.

01:03:48.557 --> 01:03:49.598
Good night.

01:03:57.723 --> 01:03:59.973
I think it's funny

01:04:00.057 --> 01:04:03.682
that all your memories of me
are from when I was five.

01:04:05.182 --> 01:04:06.765
That's not true.

01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:23.473
Gonna be fine, Howard.

01:04:25.515 --> 01:04:27.307
Yeah.

01:05:04.890 --> 01:05:08.057
No need to worry about the future

01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:10.765
'cause the future already happened.

01:05:16.598 --> 01:05:18.557
I'm already dead.

01:05:19.848 --> 01:05:22.515
The universe is already dead.

01:05:25.515 --> 01:05:27.515
It's just our perception.

01:05:32.307 --> 01:05:36.765
Keeps us stuck in slow motion.
Meanwhile...

01:05:38.723 --> 01:05:40.723
It's just our perception.

01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:45.723
Good night.

01:05:47.557 --> 01:05:48.807
Good night, boy.

01:06:24.307 --> 01:06:28.098
For a second I didn't know
who I was or where I was.

01:06:33.723 --> 01:06:38.890
Well, you're my dad,
and we are in Guadalajara.

01:06:57.557 --> 01:06:58.723
Yeah.

01:06:59.182 --> 01:07:02.515
You know,
I would die for a cigarette right now.

01:07:04.348 --> 01:07:06.723
Interesting choice of words.

01:07:10.265 --> 01:07:11.640
Look over there.

01:07:11.723 --> 01:07:13.848
I think I got a pack over there.

01:07:16.307 --> 01:07:18.640
You're kidding me.

01:07:18.723 --> 01:07:20.265
No, I'm not.

01:07:21.890 --> 01:07:24.807
What, you're afraid I'm gonna get cancer?

01:07:29.765 --> 01:07:32.973
Come on, Eunice. Look over there.
See if I got a cigarette.

01:07:36.848 --> 01:07:39.682
This is unbelievable. You're unbelievable.

01:07:40.223 --> 01:07:41.640
Yeah, you have one left.

01:07:41.723 --> 01:07:44.140
One last cigarette.

01:07:44.223 --> 01:07:45.307
Thank you.

01:08:14.723 --> 01:08:15.765
Look at that.

01:08:27.098 --> 01:08:30.807
- So long.
- Bye.

01:08:56.682 --> 01:08:59.265
You hungry, too? Here you go. Howard.

01:09:01.598 --> 01:09:03.390
Good boy.

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:12.723
Hey, Mexican junk food
is the <i>Mona Lisa</i> of junk food.

01:09:12.807 --> 01:09:15.307
I'm sure Lucas would love this stuff.

01:09:15.390 --> 01:09:17.682
Be sure to bring him some
when you go back home, okay?

01:09:17.765 --> 01:09:20.015
Dad, have a seat.
You were in there for a while.

01:09:20.098 --> 01:09:23.098
- Okay.
- All right? We gotta get you hooked up.

01:09:32.890 --> 01:09:35.223
Hey! Hey!

01:10:04.723 --> 01:10:06.432
Give me a beer, Dad.

01:10:09.098 --> 01:10:10.140
Yeah.

01:10:16.598 --> 01:10:18.432
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

01:10:28.890 --> 01:10:33.890
You know, I used to think you kept that
picture because of the pig and not me.

01:10:33.973 --> 01:10:36.473
What kind of person you think I am?

01:10:38.890 --> 01:10:41.432
Why don't you tell me?

01:10:43.015 --> 01:10:44.848
What, Eunice?

01:10:45.557 --> 01:10:49.098
You want the two of us
to have one of those touching

01:10:49.182 --> 01:10:52.223
father-daughter moments, like on TV?

01:10:54.598 --> 01:10:57.682
Yeah. Okay. I do.

01:10:59.432 --> 01:11:01.348
Why force this, Eunice?

01:11:02.348 --> 01:11:06.640
I did what I did,
and nothing can change that,

01:11:06.723 --> 01:11:08.223
so why bother?

01:11:15.348 --> 01:11:18.057
You know,
everybody takes death so seriously.

01:11:18.182 --> 01:11:23.390
Everyone feels the need to find
some meaning in every goddamn thing.

01:11:25.473 --> 01:11:30.973
They all wanna have
some meaningful conversation.

01:11:33.598 --> 01:11:35.223
Let me tell you something.

01:11:38.557 --> 01:11:41.015
There's no meaning, Eunice.

01:11:43.307 --> 01:11:46.765
I just want to know what you're feeling.

01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:53.057
I can't cry,
if that's what you're getting at.

01:12:00.057 --> 01:12:02.640
Look, I have feelings.

01:12:04.307 --> 01:12:05.765
It's just that

01:12:07.682 --> 01:12:09.890
they aren't nice right now.

01:12:11.057 --> 01:12:13.098
I'd rather not share them.

01:12:36.348 --> 01:12:37.598
Pull over.

01:12:37.682 --> 01:12:39.973
What's the matter? What is it?

01:12:40.807 --> 01:12:42.807
- You gonna be sick?
- Pull over.

01:12:42.890 --> 01:12:44.973
- Oh, my God. Right here?
- Yeah, right here.

01:12:46.098 --> 01:12:47.807
Dad, this isn't the best spot.

01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:51.223
All right. All right.

01:13:04.807 --> 01:13:06.015
It's all right.

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:12.265
It's the winding road. It's too much?

01:13:13.057 --> 01:13:14.057
No.

01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:15.640
- Too winding?
- No, no.

01:13:15.723 --> 01:13:18.390
- Be careful. Be careful.
- All right.

01:13:23.098 --> 01:13:25.932
- You sure you're good?
- I'm good.

01:13:39.932 --> 01:13:41.223
No.

01:13:41.723 --> 01:13:43.890
No, no, no, no.

01:13:47.807 --> 01:13:49.390
It's the battery.

01:13:50.598 --> 01:13:51.723
Shit.

01:13:58.432 --> 01:13:59.890
I'm getting nothing.

01:14:07.557 --> 01:14:09.098
How about...

01:14:09.182 --> 01:14:11.848
- See, we got another battery here. Okay?
- No.

01:14:11.932 --> 01:14:13.473
Let's get out of here.

01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:17.473
You need that, Dad.
You need that for breathing.

01:14:19.932 --> 01:14:21.140
Hold on.

01:14:23.682 --> 01:14:27.432
Hey! Hey! Please!

01:14:31.765 --> 01:14:32.807
Howard!

01:14:35.223 --> 01:14:36.723
Howard!

01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:38.557
Dad!

01:14:39.098 --> 01:14:40.140
Boy!

01:14:41.182 --> 01:14:42.782
- Come on.
- Come on, what are you doing?

01:14:42.807 --> 01:14:44.098
Where are we going out here?

01:14:44.182 --> 01:14:46.765
- I've gotta get there. Get the battery.
- Dad, we're gonna...

01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:49.557
I can do without it. Hey, Howard.

01:14:49.890 --> 01:14:51.533
- Howard's fine.
- Okay, I need some of that...

01:14:51.557 --> 01:14:53.658
- Come on, let's get out of here. Okay?
- Please sit down.

01:14:53.682 --> 01:14:55.348
- Go get the battery, okay?
- I will.

01:14:55.432 --> 01:14:56.991
You need to sit. We'll get your tank back.

01:14:57.015 --> 01:14:59.640
- No, no. You just get the battery.
- All right.

01:14:59.723 --> 01:15:01.265
- Okay. All right.
- All right.

01:15:01.348 --> 01:15:02.783
What'll you do with the battery, Dad?

01:15:02.807 --> 01:15:05.307
No, no, I don't need the battery.
I can deal without it.

01:15:05.390 --> 01:15:07.491
- Go get it.
- Don't be crazy, you need it to breathe.

01:15:07.515 --> 01:15:09.908
- No, no, I can deal without it here.
- What are you talking about?

01:15:09.932 --> 01:15:11.699
We don't even know how far away
it is that we're going.

01:15:11.723 --> 01:15:13.973
- Go check your phone.
- I don't have any reception.

01:15:14.057 --> 01:15:15.949
Well, that's why we need to
get the hell out of here.

01:15:15.973 --> 01:15:18.932
- Wait, let me get your tank.
- Okay. All right.

01:15:20.348 --> 01:15:23.890
- Okay, and hurry up. Just bring it here.
- I got it! I got it!

01:15:23.973 --> 01:15:27.390
I'll be fine.
Get us all killed here. Shit.

01:15:31.515 --> 01:15:32.598
Okay.

01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:35.765
You're all right, boy.

01:16:01.057 --> 01:16:02.098
Okay.

01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:09.182
Please.

01:16:20.432 --> 01:16:23.848
Dad, please don't die.
Put your seat belt on.

01:16:25.057 --> 01:16:27.140
It's easy for you to say.

01:16:32.223 --> 01:16:33.682
Put your seat belt on.

01:17:03.765 --> 01:17:05.890
I'm sorry, Eunice.

01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:09.557
I brought you into the world,

01:17:10.682 --> 01:17:12.890
but maybe you didn't wanna come.

01:17:15.307 --> 01:17:16.932
What do you mean?

01:17:21.390 --> 01:17:23.390
I wish it were nicer.

01:17:25.932 --> 01:17:27.932
You wish what were nicer?

01:17:30.973 --> 01:17:33.307
This world.

01:17:37.432 --> 01:17:39.390
You having fun?

01:17:43.598 --> 01:17:46.390
It was all about having fun, isn't it?

01:17:49.098 --> 01:17:53.140
That's what you always said,
the whole point of being alive

01:17:55.890 --> 01:17:58.265
is having fun.

01:18:00.890 --> 01:18:03.015
I don't think I'm having fun anymore.

01:18:08.057 --> 01:18:10.015
I wanna have fun.

01:18:29.265 --> 01:18:33.098
How you holding up, Dad?
You want some music?

01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:36.182
Yeah.

01:18:45.682 --> 01:18:46.890
Is that nice?

01:18:51.973 --> 01:18:53.557
What?

01:18:54.890 --> 01:18:56.765
I like your eyes.

01:19:51.515 --> 01:19:53.598
Oh, my God, we made it.

01:19:57.223 --> 01:19:58.348
Okay.

01:20:00.015 --> 01:20:02.182
- Let's get you inside, all right?
- Yeah.

01:20:06.223 --> 01:20:08.223
I'll get the stuff, Dad.

01:20:24.807 --> 01:20:25.890
Dad?

01:20:27.015 --> 01:20:33.015
Dad! Help! Please. Help, please. Dad?
Oh, my God.

01:20:33.307 --> 01:20:34.307
Help! Sir?

01:20:34.390 --> 01:20:35.515
What's happening?

01:20:36.557 --> 01:20:39.348
I need the tank in the back of my truck.

01:20:39.432 --> 01:20:42.057
Oxygen. Oxygen.

01:20:43.557 --> 01:20:47.557
I need to get him...
I need to take him inside, all right?

01:20:54.598 --> 01:20:55.890
Yep, there we go.

01:20:55.973 --> 01:20:57.432
I see a chair, right there.

01:20:57.515 --> 01:20:59.848
I wanna put you in that chair
right over there, okay?

01:21:00.723 --> 01:21:03.057
All right. All right.

01:21:04.265 --> 01:21:06.848
Put him in the chair. That's it. Okay.

01:21:07.723 --> 01:21:09.390
Please...

01:21:11.182 --> 01:21:12.890
I have electric...

01:21:15.223 --> 01:21:17.932
We're gonna breathe now, okay?

01:21:18.015 --> 01:21:19.640
We're gonna take a breath, right now.

01:21:19.723 --> 01:21:23.015
Gonna drink that water, okay?

01:21:23.098 --> 01:21:27.307
There we go. There we go.
Just breathe, Dad.

01:21:27.390 --> 01:21:30.515
Take a breath. We're here now, all right?

01:21:30.807 --> 01:21:33.473
Take a breath. Take a breath.

01:21:33.557 --> 01:21:37.723
All right. Okay. Okay.

01:21:37.807 --> 01:21:41.640
All right. We made it. We made it, okay?

01:21:41.723 --> 01:21:46.515
You're here with me.
That was scary. That was scary.

01:21:46.598 --> 01:21:48.807
But we're here now. <i>Gracias.</i>

01:21:48.890 --> 01:21:52.057
Okay. Okay. All right.

01:21:53.057 --> 01:21:54.598
All right, just breathe.

01:21:56.557 --> 01:21:59.932
That's it. That's it. That's it.

01:22:01.348 --> 01:22:04.807
You got stuck taking care of me.

01:22:09.390 --> 01:22:12.765
Yeah, it's just my luck, right?

01:22:14.557 --> 01:22:16.723
I was never there for you.

01:22:26.807 --> 01:22:29.265
Your mother found a good man

01:22:30.973 --> 01:22:35.057
who loved her, who loved you.

01:22:38.223 --> 01:22:40.182
I know

01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:44.557
the best was for me to fuck off.

01:23:00.723 --> 01:23:03.473
We're here now, Dad. Okay?

01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:32.807
That shirt looks very nice on you.

01:23:34.432 --> 01:23:36.723
Very smart.

01:23:39.723 --> 01:23:41.932
You should eat something.

01:23:43.557 --> 01:23:46.140
No, we should be going.

01:23:46.223 --> 01:23:50.057
You know, the van is hot. For Howard.

01:23:51.473 --> 01:23:54.807
We gotta find Ermilo, okay?

01:23:56.432 --> 01:23:59.574
Are you sure you don't want to rest, Dad?
There's a hotel right around the corner.

01:23:59.598 --> 01:24:01.057
I could use a shower.

01:24:02.223 --> 01:24:03.598
I don't want to stop.

01:24:03.682 --> 01:24:07.557
I'd rather sleep on the boat than in here.

01:24:09.390 --> 01:24:11.265
Right. Okay.

01:24:14.015 --> 01:24:15.515
Then I'll go get Howard,

01:24:17.932 --> 01:24:20.057
and I'll go look for your friend.

01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:22.223
You wait here.

01:24:41.515 --> 01:24:43.598
- Come on, Howard.
<i>- Ándale.</i>

01:24:43.682 --> 01:24:44.765
Go ahead, Howard.

01:24:44.848 --> 01:24:47.307
Okay, come on. <i>Ándale.</i>

01:24:47.390 --> 01:24:48.765
Good boy, Howard.

01:24:48.848 --> 01:24:49.848
- Hey, Manuel.
- What?

01:24:49.932 --> 01:24:53.390
Go get the old black man over there
and bring him to the dock.

01:24:55.515 --> 01:24:58.140
- What about my father?
- We're gonna get your father.

01:24:58.223 --> 01:25:00.765
He's gone to get your father,
and we're gonna pick it up.

01:25:00.848 --> 01:25:02.140
- Yes? In the boat?
- Yes. Yes.

01:25:02.223 --> 01:25:03.390
- Okay.
- Yes.

01:25:11.890 --> 01:25:14.932
- Ambrose.
- Hey, Ermilo.

01:25:16.390 --> 01:25:19.140
- How are you?
- Good. Good.

01:25:19.223 --> 01:25:23.557
- Let me help you with this.
- Okay. Okay.

01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:25.223
How are you? How do you feel?

01:25:26.723 --> 01:25:30.057
What can I say? We ain't young anymore.

01:25:32.015 --> 01:25:35.015
Why didn't you bring her before?
She's cute.

01:25:40.473 --> 01:25:41.890
Okay.

01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:49.348
You got your pig, you got your oxygen.
What else do you need, <i>pinche huevón?</i>

01:25:50.182 --> 01:25:52.390
You should've raised chickens instead.

01:25:52.473 --> 01:25:54.140
They're too stupid,

01:25:54.223 --> 01:25:55.723
and they're not family.

01:26:32.973 --> 01:26:34.890
Did you see that?

01:26:36.390 --> 01:26:37.640
See what?

01:26:44.557 --> 01:26:46.140
I saw it.

01:26:47.807 --> 01:26:49.557
You saw what, Dad?

01:27:35.932 --> 01:27:37.432
Is it here, Dad?

01:27:44.140 --> 01:27:45.473
You were right.

01:28:02.723 --> 01:28:04.015
Hello.

01:28:06.765 --> 01:28:08.682
- Hi.
- Welcome!

01:28:09.140 --> 01:28:10.682
This is amazing.

01:28:10.765 --> 01:28:12.557
Is it okay to jump?

01:28:14.265 --> 01:28:15.432
Help her, guys!

01:28:17.057 --> 01:28:19.640
- Now I'm all wet.
- It's okay.

01:28:19.723 --> 01:28:23.265
Your dad was right. You're beautiful!

01:28:23.348 --> 01:28:24.973
It's so nice to finally meet you.

01:28:25.057 --> 01:28:26.640
Where's Lucas? You didn't bring him?

01:28:26.723 --> 01:28:29.223
- No...
- Look, this is Brianda.

01:28:29.307 --> 01:28:30.807
- She's your dad's...
- Hi.

01:28:30.890 --> 01:28:33.057
Well, your dad can tell you about Brianda.

01:28:33.557 --> 01:28:35.932
- Hello.
- Hi, Eunice.

01:28:36.015 --> 01:28:38.473
- I've heard a lot about you.
- Ambrose!

01:28:39.807 --> 01:28:41.390
Ambrose!

01:28:45.432 --> 01:28:46.515
Dad?

01:28:48.932 --> 01:28:50.057
Dad!

01:28:50.140 --> 01:28:51.723
Ambrose?

01:32:59.890 --> 01:33:05.890
