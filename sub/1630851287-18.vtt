Dad, did you remember
to ask the boat mechanic

00:36.704 --> 00:38.095
if we could add armored plating

00:38.113 --> 00:40.372
in case a vengeful Triton
rises from the deep?

00:40.599 --> 00:42.190
Oh, and did you ask him
if we can add

00:42.284 --> 00:43.709
-a photo booth to the boat?
-Yeah, with fun props,

00:43.936 --> 00:46.528
like a little top hat
and a giant mustache on a stick.

00:46.622 --> 00:49.289
No, I forgot to ask them
about those things.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.291
And, also, I don't want to.

00:51.443 --> 00:53.868
All right.
Looks like the water pump broke.

00:53.962 --> 00:55.036
Should be about a week to fix.

00:55.130 --> 00:56.797
-I'll call you when it's ready.
-A week?

00:56.891 --> 00:58.390
I haven't been off the water
that long

00:58.542 --> 01:01.134
since I was accidentally stabbed
at Vera's birthday party.

01:01.287 --> 01:04.212
That woman does not
like surprises. Or me.

01:04.231 --> 01:06.732
A week off the boat
is gonna be hard for you, Dad.

01:06.959 --> 01:08.308
Ooh, you could take up a hobby.

01:08.460 --> 01:09.884
What about a mime workshop?

01:09.978 --> 01:12.905
I think you'll find, once you
start miming, it really...

01:13.056 --> 01:14.389
pulls you in.

01:14.558 --> 01:16.075
Hey there, Beef.
Couldn't help overhearing.

01:16.302 --> 01:17.576
I've got the ears of a gazelle.

01:17.653 --> 01:20.061
I hear my neighbor Daxon's
pleasure moans

01:20.081 --> 01:21.638
every time he eats.

01:21.657 --> 01:22.730
I'll have what he's having.

01:22.825 --> 01:24.232
Since your boat's
gonna be out of service,

01:24.251 --> 01:26.643
I'd love to have you aboard
my boat for the week.

01:26.736 --> 01:27.586
I could use the help.

01:27.663 --> 01:28.645
No. I mean,

01:28.664 --> 01:29.663
that's a kind offer,

01:29.815 --> 01:30.905
but I have a lot
of little things

01:30.925 --> 01:32.574
I've been meaning to do at home.

01:32.668 --> 01:33.759
The mitten bin is a disgrace,

01:33.928 --> 01:36.095
and I need to reorganize
the cereals.

01:36.246 --> 01:38.655
I saw a Cap'n Crunch
in with the Cheerios

01:38.674 --> 01:40.099
and it gave me a cold chill.

01:40.175 --> 01:43.009
Well, if you change your mind,
just give me a holler.

01:43.162 --> 01:44.586
Or even a loud whisper.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.179
I'll hear you either way.

01:46.332 --> 01:47.606
<i> JUDY:</i>
<i> Hey, Dad, why didn't</i>
<i> you take Londra</i>

01:47.833 --> 01:50.033
up on her offer?
I know your life, your lover,

01:50.093 --> 01:51.668
your lady is the sea.

01:51.687 --> 01:53.170
Yeah, remember when
we went to Anchorage

01:53.263 --> 01:55.763
and you were medically diagnosed
with land sickness?

01:55.783 --> 01:58.099
In my opinion,
a captain shouldn't work aboard

01:58.119 --> 01:59.359
another captain's ship.

01:59.511 --> 02:00.786
Putting two captains on one boat

02:01.013 --> 02:03.771
is like putting two cobras
in one sack--

02:03.866 --> 02:05.015
they might kill each other

02:05.184 --> 02:07.108
and they'll definitely
ruin the sack.

02:07.128 --> 02:08.685
No. Not the sack.

02:08.704 --> 02:12.189
Dad, couldn't you let go of
your captain-ness for one day?

02:12.207 --> 02:13.465
I wish I could, Judy,

02:13.692 --> 02:15.709
but I once worked a day aboard
my friend Gordon's boat.

02:15.803 --> 02:18.211
His captaining style
was an absolute nightmare.

02:18.364 --> 02:20.806
He left a bucket on the deck
and I stumbled on it.

02:20.957 --> 02:22.457
Then I called him
"slightly reckless"

02:22.476 --> 02:24.309
and he called me
"overly worried."

02:24.461 --> 02:26.052
-Whoa.
-I wouldn't want to get into

02:26.129 --> 02:28.981
a vicious exchange of words
like that with Londra.

02:29.132 --> 02:30.891
If I need to feel
the motion of the sea,

02:31.043 --> 02:32.985
I can try standing
on Ham's beanbag chair.

02:33.136 --> 02:36.137
Oh, yeah. And I could throw a
glass of salt water in your face

02:36.157 --> 02:37.990
and make dolphin noises,
if that would help.

02:38.141 --> 02:40.550
Thank you, Ham.
I believe it would.

02:40.569 --> 02:42.386

02:43.980 --> 02:45.238
-What do you think?
-I like it.

02:45.391 --> 02:46.556
I want to try a new look,

02:46.575 --> 02:48.149
but I'm just not sure
I can pull it off.

02:48.169 --> 02:49.817
The guy who wears this hat
is a total maverick.

02:49.912 --> 02:52.987
He's the guy that leans
against the wall in group photos

02:53.007 --> 02:54.748
and tells Brenda
to hold his calls.

02:54.900 --> 02:56.324
You can be that guy, babe.

02:56.402 --> 02:57.417
Tell me to hold your calls.

02:57.569 --> 02:59.011
-Calls my hold!
-You'll get there.

02:59.162 --> 03:01.571

Honeybee, this is not a drill.

03:01.590 --> 03:05.100

He's an Elite.
No, an Elite Plus.

03:11.174 --> 03:13.099
No, he's a Star Elite.

03:13.194 --> 03:14.584
Are you sure, Wolf?

03:14.603 --> 03:16.511
We've never ranked a Star Elite
in person before.

03:16.647 --> 03:18.864
I mean, what's a guy like this
even doing in Lone Moose?

03:19.033 --> 03:21.942
Probably filming a movie called
<i>Hunk City: The Mayor's a Hunk.</i>

03:22.094 --> 03:23.944
You know what,
I am gonna buy a hat.

03:24.096 --> 03:26.112
But the one
that touched his head.

03:26.207 --> 03:27.372
Maybe hotness is contagious.

03:27.524 --> 03:29.023
The science
isn't settled on that yet.

03:29.192 --> 03:30.542
You get the hat
and snap a pic real quick,

03:30.694 --> 03:32.436
and then we need to enter
this guy into the system.

03:32.529 --> 03:33.879
I'm gonna delete
some of our wedding photos

03:34.030 --> 03:35.363

we have enough storage.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.031

and face the truth: I'm just

07:46.950 --> 07:48.041
not the kind of guy
who can pull off

07:48.193 --> 07:49.450
a style like this. Look!

07:49.544 --> 07:51.027
No. No, no, no, don't look.
Play it cool.

07:51.120 --> 07:52.362
Uh, pretend to be asleep.

07:52.455 --> 07:53.454
(whispering):
I'm sorry. I'm freaking out.

07:53.623 --> 07:54.380
Oh, my God. It's him.

07:54.533 --> 07:55.790
The Lone Moose mystery hottie.

07:55.884 --> 07:58.551
<i> FEMALE VOICE:</i>
<i> Star Elite.</i>

07:58.704 --> 08:00.020
We got to talk to him.

08:00.797 --> 08:02.481
(chuckling awkwardly)

08:02.632 --> 08:03.815
Um... hello?

08:04.042 --> 08:06.726
Hey! I haven't sexy you
around before.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.728
-I'm sorry?
-Oh, uh, begorgeous.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.322
A-Are you, uh, stunning in town?

08:10.473 --> 08:11.881
(groans, whimpers)
Oh, no.

08:11.900 --> 08:14.384
Do you need some help
with something?

08:14.402 --> 08:16.386
Oh. Um, okay.

08:16.479 --> 08:17.721
Hi. I'm Wade.

08:17.814 --> 08:18.830
Nice to meet you. I'm Honeybee,

08:18.982 --> 08:20.481
and this is my husband, Wolf.

08:20.501 --> 08:24.060
And I'm Wolf. Uh, uh,
what brings you to Lone Moose?

08:24.153 --> 08:25.562
A high-end modeling job?

08:25.731 --> 08:28.656
(chuckles) No. I'm actually
here visiting my aunt.

08:28.675 --> 08:31.234
And I wanted to come check out
the Lone Moose Mall.

08:31.253 --> 08:32.660
I just really like shops.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.904
And it's always interesting
to see a new parking lot.

08:34.906 --> 08:37.407
Yeah, Lone Moose
rips so hard, brother.

08:37.467 --> 08:40.093
Hey, Wade, we would be
terrible Lone-Moosers

08:40.262 --> 08:41.411
if we didn't offer to buy you

08:41.504 --> 08:44.505
a Welcome to Lone Moose
welcome lunch.

08:44.599 --> 08:45.506
Huh?

08:45.600 --> 08:46.507
I love lunch.

08:46.585 --> 08:47.842
I tend to eat it
after breakfast.

08:47.936 --> 08:49.602
Not right after,
but a few hours after.

08:49.738 --> 08:52.197
Great. And we have a hookup
at the Point & Shoot.

08:52.348 --> 08:55.108
We can get you five percent off
any family portrait set.

08:55.260 --> 08:56.442
Oh... my... God.

08:56.595 --> 08:58.444
Should we all go get
a group photo right now?

08:58.597 --> 09:00.263
-Should we just do it?
-Uh, actually,

09:00.282 --> 09:01.873
I still have
some shopping to do.

09:02.066 --> 09:04.042
I need to get one dozen pairs
of white socks.

09:04.119 --> 09:05.769
But I guess lunch
would be okay afterwards.

09:05.862 --> 09:08.213
Yeah, totally. Let's just see
where the day takes us.

09:08.364 --> 09:11.608
Okay. I'll, uh, meet you
at the food court in two hours?

09:11.626 --> 09:13.459
(chuckles):
Not if we meet you first.

09:13.612 --> 09:15.278
I'm sorry,
did you want to meet sooner?

09:15.371 --> 09:16.629
Two hours is perfect.
See you then.

09:16.706 --> 09:19.373
Not if we see him then first.
(laughing)

09:19.467 --> 09:23.136
Brunhelga, I'm so glad you
could join us on our journey.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.804
Pietr is my first mate.

09:24.956 --> 09:26.547
You can be my second mate.

09:26.608 --> 09:27.624
What do I do,

09:27.642 --> 09:29.234
spread mustard on the deck?

09:29.461 --> 09:30.960
Dip the ropes in mustard?

09:31.054 --> 09:33.129
Don't worry.
I'm here to help you.

09:33.148 --> 09:34.314
I'm the captain.

09:34.466 --> 09:35.982
<i> Ja,</i> we just listen to him

09:36.134 --> 09:37.483
<i> und</i> everything will be fine.

09:37.578 --> 09:40.078
It's a big responsibility
to be the captain.

09:40.229 --> 09:43.582
So big, in fact, that
I can't express it in words.

09:43.809 --> 09:45.566
I can only express it in...

09:45.735 --> 09:47.902
I hope he says "a sea shanty."

Okay, so what's the plan?

10:26.609 --> 10:28.627
Obviously, we become
best friends with Wade,

10:28.854 --> 10:30.687
probably go on a life-changing
road trip together.

10:30.780 --> 10:31.963
-But then what?
-I don't know.

10:32.115 --> 10:34.115
But this guy should be acting
in movies.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.449
That's it. That's it!

10:35.543 --> 10:37.360
Oh, we already have
a videography company,

10:37.453 --> 10:40.287
so why not branch out
into celebrity management, too?

10:40.340 --> 10:41.956
So we'd sign Wade as a client?

10:41.975 --> 10:44.200
Okay, but what does
a manager do?

10:44.219 --> 10:46.202
We get him jobs in Hollywood.

10:46.221 --> 10:47.795
He could be the new the Rock.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.314
U-Uh, no offense
to the old the Rock.

10:49.465 --> 10:50.982
Yeah, but how do we do that?

10:51.209 --> 10:53.209
Uh, we'd probably make
some-some phone calls?

10:53.302 --> 10:55.136
You know? To the people
who give out the Hollywood jobs.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.638
A-And emails, of course.
Can't forget that part.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.065
And we should probably
get an assistant.

10:59.217 --> 11:01.308
I'm gonna be nice to her,
but every once in a while,

11:01.328 --> 11:02.568
I'm gonna have to be firm.

11:02.663 --> 11:04.070
Ooh, maybe this can help us.

11:04.147 --> 11:06.164
<i> There Will Be Mud:</i>
<i> A Hollywood Survival Guide</i>

11:06.391 --> 11:08.816
<i>to Get You Winkin' Like Lincoln</i>

11:08.835 --> 11:11.060
Ooh, or maybe this one:

11:11.154 --> 11:12.412
by the guy who played Urkel.

11:12.506 --> 11:14.673
Comrades, we have
made good time,

11:14.900 --> 11:16.749
and our voyage nears its end.

11:16.902 --> 11:19.085
Should we sing the song
praising the captain again?

11:19.179 --> 11:22.238

11:26.094 --> 11:27.018
(regular accent):
I wa...

11:27.170 --> 11:29.354
I wasn't playing with toys.

11:29.431 --> 11:32.506
I was just organizing
this boat on the carpet

11:32.526 --> 11:33.983
and-and now I'm done.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.605
So, you built
our little figurines a ship?

11:39.774 --> 11:41.366
-It seems that way.
-And you're acting out a scene

11:41.593 --> 11:44.369
pretending to be a captain
on an imaginary boat?

11:44.520 --> 11:47.597
-Yes, I guess I was.
-Dad, this is very weird,

11:47.615 --> 11:49.207
but also fun
that you're doing this?

11:49.358 --> 11:51.042
I'm all in. Can I be Pietr?

11:51.269 --> 11:53.044
I've always wondered what it's
like to be trapped in a cup.

11:53.196 --> 11:55.605
Remember? That's how I broke
Mom's oversized wineglass.

11:55.698 --> 11:58.124
Oh, right, that's when she
started drinking from a vase.

11:58.293 --> 11:59.384
So, what's the story?

11:59.611 --> 12:01.720
Well, Rolf
is a competent captain

12:01.796 --> 12:03.129
with the respect of the crew.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.206
And Pietr wanted
to be a captain,

12:05.300 --> 12:07.225
but he got trapped in a stein.

12:07.452 --> 12:08.876
-Hmm.
-What do you mean, "hmm"?

12:08.895 --> 12:10.286
Maybe we should shake things up

12:10.379 --> 12:11.730
and, uh, I'll be
the captain for a while.

12:11.881 --> 12:14.807
(scoffs) There are two things
you don't shake up, Judy:

12:14.901 --> 12:16.976
sodas and the chain of command.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.404
And now, let us
resume our voyage.

12:19.555 --> 12:23.633
(German accent):
Well, Pietr, we should be at
Fireplace Island very shortly.

12:23.726 --> 12:25.392
JUDY (German accent):
Hmm, I feel like we'd miss out

12:25.561 --> 12:27.653
if we didn't visit
Coffee Table Cove.

12:27.806 --> 12:30.640
Some say there's treasure
buried beneath it.

12:30.733 --> 12:33.901
But as the captain, I wouldn't
want to risk our voyage

12:33.979 --> 12:35.569
when we're so close
to being done.

12:35.663 --> 12:39.591
Okay, mm-hmm, but what if I took
over as captain for a while

12:39.818 --> 12:43.503
and you could just sit back
and enjoy the fun voyage?

12:43.597 --> 12:46.823
No, my beer-bottomed boy,
we have been over this.

12:46.841 --> 12:48.749
I can't just stop
being a captain.

12:48.876 --> 12:51.936
It's who I am deep down
to my little porcelain bones.

12:52.088 --> 12:54.588
But maybe I have
captain bones, too.

12:54.682 --> 12:56.015
You have beer bones, Pietr.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.443
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
you two are just cranky

12:58.594 --> 13:01.279
because your systems
are low on mustard.

13:01.506 --> 13:03.782
Everyone, open up for a scoop.

13:03.933 --> 13:06.433
Feeling flustered,
eat some mustard.

13:06.528 --> 13:08.102
(laughter)

13:09.347 --> 13:11.939
Do you guys want to share
some of my plain white rice?

13:11.958 --> 13:13.533
It's finally cooled
to room temperature.

13:13.685 --> 13:15.442
I could put some salt on it
if you want to go there.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.870
Actually, Wade,
why don't you share

13:17.947 --> 13:19.280
-some things about yourself?
-Yeah.

13:19.374 --> 13:20.781
And don't leave out anything.

13:20.801 --> 13:23.301
Give us all 50 shades of Wade.

13:23.452 --> 13:27.030
Okay, uh...
well, I was born in Anchorage.

13:27.123 --> 13:29.140
Mm. Fascinating. Go on.

13:29.367 --> 13:31.551
Uh, I love to laugh.

13:31.627 --> 13:33.553
(cackles)

13:33.647 --> 13:35.146
Oh, same, buddy.

13:35.298 --> 13:37.482
-And a special skill I have...
-Here comes the boom.

13:37.633 --> 13:39.300
is that if there are
two forks on a table,

13:39.394 --> 13:42.028
I can always tell which one is
bigger just by looking at them.

13:42.138 --> 13:44.138
Wow, looking forward
to seeing that, Wade.

13:44.215 --> 13:45.565
So what kind of work do you do?

13:45.717 --> 13:47.050
Oh, I'm a temp.

13:47.068 --> 13:48.551
I guess I haven't
really found my calling,

13:48.570 --> 13:51.329
but I'm pretty good at Excel,
so it's working out fine.

13:51.556 --> 13:54.815
Well, ring, ring, Wade. Your
calling has maybe just arrived.

13:54.835 --> 13:56.000
What do you know about the biz,

13:56.152 --> 13:58.986
aka Hollyweird,
aka Tinsel Township?

13:59.080 --> 14:00.746
Um, not much.

14:00.899 --> 14:03.157
My friend Wendy
used to have Cinemax.

14:03.326 --> 14:05.159
Well, it's all about
who you know.

14:05.253 --> 14:06.344
Uh, do you know Tom Cruise?

14:06.495 --> 14:07.846
Babe, he doesn't know
Tom Cruise.

14:07.997 --> 14:09.906
Listen, Wade, you ever
watch a movie and think,

14:09.999 --> 14:12.075
-"I could do that"?
-Nope, nuh-uh.

14:12.168 --> 14:13.259
I get terrible stage fright.

14:13.336 --> 14:15.002
Yeah, stages
are very scary to me.

14:15.021 --> 14:17.263
I got trapped inside one
once at a magic show.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.082
Not a deal breaker.
We're talking more

14:19.100 --> 14:20.249
about screen than stage.

14:20.343 --> 14:21.860
Would you consider
nudity for the right role?

14:22.087 --> 14:24.103
Nudity?
Guys, what's going on here?

14:24.255 --> 14:27.348
-Is this...
-A huge career opportunity? Yes.

14:27.442 --> 14:29.592
You just relax
and have some more rice.

14:29.761 --> 14:31.761
We got it all covered.

14:31.779 --> 14:33.705
Have what covered? Are you guys
from the temp agency?

14:33.856 --> 14:34.873
Is this because I changed

14:35.100 --> 14:36.690
my computer background
to Winnie the Pooh?

14:36.768 --> 14:38.692
Serena said it was okay.
I can change it back.

14:38.786 --> 14:40.770
Everything's fine, Wade.
Just excuse us for a sec.

14:40.788 --> 14:43.289
Wolf, could you join me
as I refill my Mr. Pibb?

14:43.383 --> 14:46.442
Hey, who's this Mr. Pibb guy?
Should I be jealous? (chuckles)

14:46.461 --> 14:48.202
Just a little marriage
humor there, Wade.

14:48.296 --> 14:49.295
Nothing to worry about.

14:49.389 --> 14:50.704
All right, I grabbed a boat

14:50.798 --> 14:52.390
from the toy chest for myself

14:52.541 --> 14:54.541
and I am ready to play
whatever this is.

14:54.594 --> 14:56.619
Oh, no need to have
your own boat, son.

14:56.712 --> 14:59.213
Just, uh, join our crew.
We've got plenty of mustard.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.957
Ham, why don't
you go grab Helmut

15:01.050 --> 15:02.959
and then just jump right in?
You'll pick it up fast.

15:03.052 --> 15:05.461
Helmut? More like, hell<i> yes.</i>

15:05.630 --> 15:07.980
(German accent):
Pietr, stop staring longingly

15:08.099 --> 15:09.465
at Coffee Table Cove.

15:09.576 --> 15:13.152
Come join us. We are going to
roll this barrel back and forth.

15:13.304 --> 15:14.637
HAM (German accent):
Oh, that sounds fun!

15:14.656 --> 15:15.580
I'll be right down.

15:15.807 --> 15:17.248
(all screaming)

15:17.400 --> 15:18.583
Why, God, why?!

15:18.660 --> 15:19.900
(regular accent):
(gaps) Sorry, I just lotioned,

15:19.920 --> 15:21.568
and now he's dead.

15:21.737 --> 15:23.496
(regular accent):
It's all right. We'll just
sweep his shattered body

15:23.590 --> 15:24.756
off the deck, and I guess

15:24.907 --> 15:26.499
-you can be Brunhelga.
-Great.

15:26.593 --> 15:29.502
So, Pietr, you want
to go to Coffee Table Cove?

15:29.596 --> 15:32.004
Yes, but Captain Rolf
won't allow it,

15:32.157 --> 15:34.415
even though I am practically
a captain myself.

15:34.434 --> 15:35.675
(regular accent):
Well, there can only be

15:35.827 --> 15:37.602
one true captain on a ship,

15:37.753 --> 15:40.104
and on this ship,
the captain is Rolf.

15:40.256 --> 15:42.682
(German accent):
Well, on this one, it's Pietr.

15:42.834 --> 15:45.276
I am off to seek treasure
in Coffee Table Cove!

15:45.428 --> 15:48.988
Captain of my own ship,
chooser of my own destiny!

15:49.098 --> 15:51.174
Make way for Brunhelga.

15:51.267 --> 15:53.359
See you later, pretzel man.

15:53.511 --> 15:55.344
(sighs)

15:55.438 --> 15:56.621
<i> HONEYBEE:</i>
<i> Babe, I hate to say it,</i>

15:56.698 --> 15:58.181
but Wade will never
make it in Hollywood.

15:58.349 --> 15:59.457
He's too nice.

15:59.608 --> 16:00.959
That town will break his heart
and throw it back

16:01.186 --> 16:02.627
in his
perfectly-proportioned face.

16:02.778 --> 16:03.944
We... we can protect him.

16:04.038 --> 16:06.205
Uh, we'll just get him
strong, silent-guy roles.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.207
Wolf, you're not thinking
straight. You're hunk drunk.

16:08.359 --> 16:10.468
We can't be responsible for
putting that sweet, simple man

16:10.619 --> 16:12.211
into the jaws
of the Hollywood machine.

16:12.363 --> 16:14.455
-Damn it, you're right.
-We got to face facts.

16:14.532 --> 16:16.975
We're running a business here.
We have to drop him as a client.

16:17.160 --> 16:20.311
This is the bigger one!
I'm sure of it.

16:20.463 --> 16:22.647
-Ooh, Coffee Table Cove.
-We made it!

MOON (robotic voice):
Permission to board.

16:31.140 --> 16:33.232
Hello, large space robot.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.401
What brings you
to the sea today?

16:35.495 --> 16:38.404
Well, I got home from school,
I mean, space,

16:38.556 --> 16:40.814
and I couldn't find anyone
and here you are,

16:40.834 --> 16:43.059
all alone on this
beautiful ship,

16:43.077 --> 16:45.411
just as I am all alone
on my spaceship.

16:45.563 --> 16:47.654
Was everyone else
of your kind destroyed

16:47.674 --> 16:50.991
in a space-pocalypse
at the hands of Blaba-bork

16:51.085 --> 16:52.235
from the Bork System?

16:52.328 --> 16:55.496
Oh, no, I had some friends
aboard my vessel.

16:55.590 --> 16:58.516
But they departed
and now I'm all alone.

16:58.743 --> 17:00.167
Holy crap, what's that?

17:00.186 --> 17:02.245
-(growling)
-Scream sound.

17:02.263 --> 17:04.647
Scream sound. Scream sound.

17:08.028 --> 17:10.586
Coffee Table Cove
is everything I dreamed of.

17:10.605 --> 17:14.014
Ah, a rare treasure.
I spot a very, very old pretzel

17:14.034 --> 17:15.533
with peanut butter floating by.
(chuckles)

17:15.760 --> 17:19.370
Aw, this reminds me
of Rolf<i> und</i> his pretzels.

17:19.597 --> 17:21.614
Were we too hard
on that son of a bitch?

17:21.708 --> 17:23.857
-ROLF and SPACE ROBOT: Help!
-What is that sound?

17:23.951 --> 17:27.787
Is that Rolf?
And a space robot?

17:27.939 --> 17:30.289
Hey, champ, how you holding up?

17:30.383 --> 17:31.716
Uh, I'm good.

17:31.943 --> 17:34.034
No changes, really, since
you guys went to get sodas.

17:34.128 --> 17:36.703
Hey, buddy, you want to go
pick out a frozen treat

17:36.798 --> 17:38.038
from I Dream Of Creamy?

17:38.132 --> 17:40.283
-It's on us, big guy.
-No, thanks,

17:40.301 --> 17:42.060
If I eat anything cold,
I throw up.

17:42.136 --> 17:44.303
Drinks, too. Everything's
got to be room temp.

17:44.455 --> 17:47.881
Wade, listen, you strike me as
a no-nonsense kind of guy, huh?

17:47.975 --> 17:50.476
You give it to 'em straight,
no BS, no sugarcoating it.

17:50.628 --> 17:53.129
We don't always get
what we want in life, Wade.

17:53.147 --> 17:55.406
I wanted a tortoise once,
but did I get it? Yes.

17:55.558 --> 17:57.075
But it turns out
they're a lot of responsibility

17:57.226 --> 17:58.818
and they can open some cages
with their noses,

17:58.912 --> 18:00.745
so he crawled out,
never to be seen again.

18:00.896 --> 18:01.987
Is that what you want?

18:02.082 --> 18:03.897
Are you asking me
if I want a tortoise?

18:03.917 --> 18:05.917
The important thing
is to take things day by day,

18:06.086 --> 18:07.752
just keep showing up,
and in the end,

18:07.903 --> 18:10.496
you'll have taught this world
a thing or two, believe me.

18:10.648 --> 18:12.648
Just promise me you'll stay away
from Hollywood.

18:12.667 --> 18:15.242
I have a brother in Irvine
I might visit...

18:15.261 --> 18:16.594
-Promise me!
-I promise!

18:16.745 --> 18:18.154
-Now get out of here.
-What?

18:18.172 --> 18:20.656
Let's not make this any harder
than it has to be, Wade.

18:20.749 --> 18:23.267
Just go!
Go and live your normal life!

18:23.419 --> 18:24.994
(crying):
Get out of here!

18:25.012 --> 18:26.345
So you guys aren't
from the temp agency?

18:26.514 --> 18:28.773
Go, Wade, go.
You'll thank us some day.

18:28.924 --> 18:31.167
-Okay.
-And take your rice, Wade.

18:31.185 --> 18:33.093
It'll only remind us of you.

18:33.113 --> 18:34.503
I'm-I'm actually done with it.

18:34.672 --> 18:35.762
Take it. Take the rice!

18:35.857 --> 18:38.449
You're right.
I might be hungry later.

18:39.360 --> 18:40.601
I'm going
to the hand towel store.

18:40.620 --> 18:41.935
Do you guys need
anything from there?

18:42.029 --> 18:45.197
No, but thank you, Wade.
That's a very kind offer.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.125
Well, we dropped
our first client.

18:47.352 --> 18:49.443
Welcome to Hollywood.
We're in the game now.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.703
Now, what do you think
of the blond

18:50.797 --> 18:52.188
in the sweatband near the ferns?

18:52.281 --> 18:53.539
Is he golden god material?

18:53.633 --> 18:55.691
Eh, he's more
of an Everyday Evan to me.

18:55.710 --> 18:57.969
And the quest continues.

18:58.196 --> 19:01.121
I can't save you.
I'm made of electronics.

19:01.141 --> 19:02.306
I can't get wet.

19:02.383 --> 19:04.033
Rolf! Rolf!

19:04.051 --> 19:07.979
Help! My pretzel jar
is pulling me under.

19:08.130 --> 19:11.040
My sensors detect
it hates the mustard.

19:11.133 --> 19:12.466
Keep flinging.

19:12.635 --> 19:14.694
-(grunting)
-(growls)

19:16.063 --> 19:17.638
Brunhelga? Pietr?

19:17.657 --> 19:20.807
You came back, even though
you were very angry with me?

19:20.827 --> 19:23.068
Yes, Rolf,
we like you very much.

19:23.163 --> 19:27.481
But it would be more fun
to play on the boat

19:27.500 --> 19:30.168
if you let us
take turns being captain.

19:30.395 --> 19:32.395
(regular accent):
Sorry. It's just genuinely hard

19:32.413 --> 19:33.838
for me to let go.

19:33.989 --> 19:35.489
(regular accent): I know, Dad.
But when you're the captain

19:35.508 --> 19:37.175
all the time,
you might miss out on things,

19:37.402 --> 19:40.344
like hanging out
with Pietr and Brunhelga.

19:40.496 --> 19:41.712
Or Londra.

19:41.939 --> 19:43.163
I see what you're getting at.

19:43.257 --> 19:45.183
Maybe if you let someone else
lead once in a while,

19:45.410 --> 19:47.259
you would actually enjoy it.

19:47.353 --> 19:48.686
I guess it's worth a shot.

19:48.837 --> 19:52.523
Maybe Brunhelga
could be captain.

19:52.675 --> 19:53.916
Or the space guy.

19:53.918 --> 19:57.753
My name is actually...
(robot noises)

19:57.772 --> 19:59.588
...but Space Guy is fine.

19:59.607 --> 20:02.775
Do you guys want me to turn the
boat over with my space lasers?

20:02.927 --> 20:06.278
BEEF (German accent):
Wait, you have space lasers?

20:06.372 --> 20:08.855
Why didn't you just
kill the bear?

20:08.875 --> 20:12.601
Oh, yeah.
Well, you live and you learn.

20:12.620 --> 20:14.453
You certainly do.

20:14.605 --> 20:16.714
All right, Brunhelga.

20:16.941 --> 20:19.199
You've got the wheel. Where to?

20:19.293 --> 20:23.387
Space Guy,
set a course for the disco.

20:23.614 --> 20:24.797
Hey there, Beef.

20:24.949 --> 20:26.449
Come to check
on<i> The Mighty Kathleen?</i>

20:26.617 --> 20:28.875
Actually, Londra,
if it's not too late,

20:28.895 --> 20:30.228
I'd like to take you up
on your offer

20:30.396 --> 20:32.563
to go fishing with you
on your boat.

20:32.715 --> 20:33.973
Oh, great. Climb aboard.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.791
You want to take the wheel
for a bit?

20:35.884 --> 20:38.127
Yes. Wait, I mean, no.

20:38.296 --> 20:39.553
This is your boat.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.130
I'm just gonna
sit back and enjoy

20:41.148 --> 20:43.241
this journey with my friend.

20:43.392 --> 20:44.800
Maybe I could be
in charge of the mustard.

20:44.819 --> 20:47.561
-Do you have any mustard?
-Of course I have mustard.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.747
It's in the galley
right next to my cat's ashes.

20:49.898 --> 20:51.565
Rest in peace, Dr. Dumbass.

20:51.659 --> 20:54.735
He was a rescue, I couldn't
bring myself to change the name.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.312
Then I believe we're all packed.

20:56.405 --> 20:58.831
