WEBVTT

00:01.811 --> 00:04.830
Well, I didn't use breast
milk for obvious reasons.

00:05.512 --> 00:08.447
But if you just hold the bottle like
this, it won't upset his stomach.

00:08.498 --> 00:09.532
It's all in the wrist.

00:09.583 --> 00:11.884
You are a lifesaver.

00:11.969 --> 00:14.487
I thank you, Hunter thanks you,

00:14.538 --> 00:15.805
and the guy across the hall thanks you.

00:15.839 --> 00:17.423
This kid's got some lungs.

00:18.825 --> 00:20.760
Hi, Zoey. Bye, Zoey.

00:21.895 --> 00:23.696
So... (clears throat)

00:24.715 --> 00:26.682
how's your new girlfriend?

00:26.717 --> 00:28.684
Uh, Zoey is not my girlfriend.

00:28.719 --> 00:30.603
She is a friend who just
happens to be a girl.

00:30.637 --> 00:33.589
Much like you, only
with a lot less baggage.

00:33.591 --> 00:36.442
Uh, you delivered her
child on your first date,

00:36.476 --> 00:38.477
so I'd say our baggage is
a carry-on compared to hers.

00:39.896 --> 00:41.514
I thought you really liked her.

00:41.548 --> 00:44.834
I did, you know, until I saw
a human being crawl out of her.

00:46.486 --> 00:48.738
But we talked about it, we're
cool. We're just friends.

00:48.772 --> 00:50.006
It's all good.

00:50.057 --> 00:52.792
I don't know, I think Emma might
really like a little brother.

00:52.826 --> 00:54.777
Emma and I discussed it. She's fine.

00:54.811 --> 00:56.579
(elevator bell dings)

00:56.630 --> 00:58.581
Hey, sorry. One more question.

00:58.615 --> 00:59.682
Mommy.

01:01.518 --> 01:02.601
(whispers) Emma lied to you.

Ben: Just go to yoga already.

01:16.701 --> 01:18.534
- Zoey and I...
- I'm up!

01:19.536 --> 01:21.537
Oh, my god! I'm late for practice.

01:21.539 --> 01:23.506
You haven't seen me.

01:24.675 --> 01:26.542
What was that?

01:26.544 --> 01:27.710
He's been having trouble sleeping.

01:27.712 --> 01:31.547
I need pants, shoes, my gym bag. So late!

01:32.716 --> 01:35.551
One of the coaches is
giving him a bad time.

01:35.553 --> 01:37.636
Maybe the coach just likes
his players to wear pants.

01:39.556 --> 01:41.640
No, he thinks that Danny's not
playing up to his potential,

01:41.692 --> 01:43.559
which is a nice way of
saying that he sucks,

01:43.561 --> 01:45.695
which means Danny stays up all night
worrying, which means he doesn't sleep.

01:45.729 --> 01:47.646
Which means the next day
at practice he does suck,

01:47.698 --> 01:50.483
which means, his coach has a
point. It's a vicious cycle.

01:51.568 --> 01:52.735
Whoo! If anybody calls,

01:52.737 --> 01:54.620
I left a half an hour ago.

01:54.654 --> 01:56.655
No! Wait, tell them an
hour. That way I'll be early.

01:59.626 --> 02:01.043
You know, when we were dating,

02:01.078 --> 02:03.546
I never left for work without
kissing you goodbye. I'm just saying.

Advertise your product or brand here

02:13.673 --> 02:16.592
Like I said, I was just saying.

02:16.594 --> 02:18.728
Okay, say "buh-bye," it's
time for your nap. Let's go.

02:18.762 --> 02:20.596
Mama.

02:22.566 --> 02:24.600
See? It sounds to me

02:24.602 --> 02:28.571
like Emma is really feeling the need for
more of a female role model in her life.

02:28.605 --> 02:30.489
Emma has plenty of female role models.

02:30.524 --> 02:31.741
First of all, there's you. And my mom.

02:31.775 --> 02:33.609
Hey, who's got some pot?

02:34.778 --> 02:37.580
'Cause Bonnie Wheeler needs a dealer.

02:40.550 --> 02:42.568
Well, one female role model is good enough.

02:43.937 --> 02:45.888
I threw my back out at Pilates.

02:45.922 --> 02:47.490
It's killing me.

02:47.524 --> 02:50.426
I was trying to get extra bendy
for my honeymoon with Brad,

02:50.477 --> 02:51.861
if you know what I mean. Huh?

02:54.831 --> 02:56.866
Well, you got a guy 15
years younger than you,

02:56.868 --> 02:58.851
so I think Bendy Bonnie
knows what she's doing.

02:58.885 --> 03:00.603
Yeah, she does.

03:00.605 --> 03:01.654
Give it up. Pssh!

03:03.757 --> 03:05.624
Come on, Ben.

03:05.659 --> 03:06.742
You're my bad son.

03:06.777 --> 03:09.595
I know you're holdin'.

03:09.646 --> 03:12.414
Actually, I haven't been holding any
of that since I started holding this.

03:13.550 --> 03:15.451
Ri... Oh,
never mind.

03:15.485 --> 03:17.553
It's like asking a nun if
you can borrow a condom.

03:19.873 --> 03:22.424
You know what, I'm just gonna
call my high school hook-up.

03:22.459 --> 03:23.776
I hope he still has the same beeper number.

03:25.462 --> 03:27.763
Hey, Mom. Could you not plan
a drug deal in front of my kid?

03:27.814 --> 03:29.648
It's a question I shouldn't have to ask.

03:33.854 --> 03:36.672
Hey, so maybe you were right after all.

03:36.706 --> 03:39.525
Emma hasn't stopped saying
"Mama" since this morning.

03:39.576 --> 03:40.743
She even said it to the lady at the deli.

03:40.745 --> 03:43.562
Oh, well, to be fair, her name is Mama.

03:45.582 --> 03:46.899
Well, the point is,

03:46.933 --> 03:50.536
I think it's time I found a baby
mama for her and a hot mama for me.

03:50.587 --> 03:52.555
Ideally, it should be the same person

03:52.606 --> 03:54.824
but that's not set in stone.
That's where you come in.

03:55.926 --> 03:57.910
You want me to help you
find the perfect woman?

03:57.944 --> 04:00.796
Pfft. Well, as fun and awkward as
that sounds, I think I'm gonna pass.

04:00.798 --> 04:02.865
Uh, no, no, no, no, no. No, no.

04:02.899 --> 04:05.601
You broke it, you fix it.

04:06.620 --> 04:07.620
Come on!

04:07.654 --> 04:10.606
Riley, I need you to pick someone smart

04:10.657 --> 04:12.658
and sophisticated, nurturing.

04:12.709 --> 04:15.511
Really? That's what you're looking for now?

04:15.513 --> 04:17.880
Well, if she has all those
things, plus a few curves...

04:17.914 --> 04:20.866
Ahh, there it is. I knew the real
Ben was still in there somewhere.

04:20.916 --> 04:23.786
Riley, I'm placing my future in
your hands. Don't let me down.

04:25.822 --> 04:26.889
Okay, um...

04:28.425 --> 04:29.825
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

04:29.860 --> 04:31.794
Penny Paulsen! She would be perfect.

04:31.828 --> 04:33.762
I work with her. She's an amazing lawyer,

04:33.764 --> 04:35.814
went to Yale, volunteers
at an animal shelter,

04:35.866 --> 04:37.716
and I don't totally hate her.

04:37.751 --> 04:39.602
Great! But
does she have...

04:39.636 --> 04:41.737
Yeah, she has two of them,
and that better be enough.

04:41.771 --> 04:43.689
Yup, two is good.

04:43.723 --> 04:45.541
I mean, three would be overkill.

04:46.560 --> 04:47.643
Wait, would it?

04:50.914 --> 04:52.481
Oh, you know what, just set me up.

04:54.918 --> 04:57.486
♪ I got the best weed, yeah,
my green is the finest ♪

04:57.520 --> 04:59.788
♪ I'm the queen of smoking
pot so call me your highness ♪

04:59.839 --> 05:01.724
Ha-ha! Snap, y'all.

05:01.726 --> 05:02.825
- Hey, Ma.
- Oh, god, no!

05:02.859 --> 05:04.627
Oh, damn it!

05:04.629 --> 05:05.678
Ugh!

05:05.729 --> 05:06.762
You're welcome!

05:08.698 --> 05:10.666
Mom, what do you do when someone hates you?

05:10.668 --> 05:13.702
Well, in my case, I
apparently have their children.

05:15.522 --> 05:16.872
I just had the worst practice of my life.

05:16.907 --> 05:19.558
Coach keeps saying if I don't get
it together, I'm gonna be traded.

05:19.593 --> 05:21.610
But I can't get it together
without a good night's sleep.

05:21.612 --> 05:24.480
I just need to find a way to relax.

05:24.514 --> 05:26.865
Well, I might have a
friend who can help you.

05:26.917 --> 05:28.717
Let me call her.

05:28.768 --> 05:30.819
Boop, beep, boop, boop, beep, boop, boop.

05:32.756 --> 05:33.889
Hello, Mary Jane?

05:36.760 --> 05:39.612
Yes, I'd like you to meet my son, Danny.

05:40.814 --> 05:42.548
Ahh!

05:43.600 --> 05:44.733
Oh, my god. Is that what I think it is?

05:44.768 --> 05:46.669
Well, I don't know. Do you think it's dope?

05:46.703 --> 05:49.521
You don't have to call me stupid.
I just thought it was marijuana.

05:51.508 --> 05:52.841
Oh, god. Okay, listen.

05:52.892 --> 05:54.576
Honey, yes, it is.

05:54.611 --> 05:56.879
And I think you should smoke it.

05:56.881 --> 05:59.431
Mom, you know I've never done drugs.

05:59.466 --> 06:01.817
I'm a professional athlete.
My body is a temple.

06:02.852 --> 06:04.820
Yeah, well my body is a temple too.

06:04.854 --> 06:06.789
But if you see smoke
coming out of my steeple,

06:06.840 --> 06:08.691
it doesn't mean a new pope's been elected.

06:09.809 --> 06:11.660
I'll be here all week.

06:13.647 --> 06:15.581
Mom, you're not being very motherly.

06:15.615 --> 06:17.633
Honey, I'm just trying to help you.

06:17.667 --> 06:19.735
This is your career we're talking about.

06:19.769 --> 06:22.471
You have to take this seriously.

06:22.505 --> 06:23.605
Now take this.

06:23.640 --> 06:26.458
Seriously.

06:26.509 --> 06:28.861
Thanks, but no thanks. I'm just
gonna find another way to relax.

06:30.513 --> 06:31.613
Hey.

06:31.615 --> 06:34.483
And that way may have just
walked in the front door.

06:34.517 --> 06:36.852
Hey! What you doing with my stuff?

06:36.903 --> 06:41.774
Look, Danny, I feel so bad that you've
been awake all night pacing and worrying,

06:41.825 --> 06:43.676
and I really want to be there for you.

06:43.710 --> 06:45.644
But while I'm being there for you,

06:45.695 --> 06:46.812
I need you to be sleeping here for me.

06:49.683 --> 06:50.733
Ma!

06:50.735 --> 06:52.651
Will you call your friend Mary Jane?

06:54.721 --> 06:56.522
Danny: I got it, I got it. Okay.

06:56.573 --> 06:58.640
Okay, okay, listen. Ready? I'm you. Okay.

06:58.675 --> 07:00.542
If it wasn't for you kids,

07:00.577 --> 07:02.611
I could be a supermodel.
Now get me some wine.

07:02.645 --> 07:06.415
(both laughing)

07:06.449 --> 07:09.418
This is good, right? Okay,
okay, do me. You do me. Do me.

07:09.452 --> 07:10.469
Okay, okay. Okay, okay, okay, yeah!

07:10.503 --> 07:11.837
All right, all right.

07:11.871 --> 07:13.756
(sniffling)

07:14.758 --> 07:17.376
I've been in love with Riley my whole life,

07:17.410 --> 07:18.794
even when she was fat.

07:20.730 --> 07:24.717
Oh, my god, it's like
listening to a mirror.

07:24.768 --> 07:27.619
Wait, wait, but Mom, wait,
how do we know if we're high?

07:27.654 --> 07:29.671
- Mm-hmm.
- Because I don't feel high.

07:29.673 --> 07:31.590
I'm just relaxed, you know?

07:31.624 --> 07:35.561
I feel like scales on a cosmic
lizard gliding through the universe.

07:37.580 --> 07:38.814
- Shh!
- Oh.

07:38.848 --> 07:41.417
Perfect. I didn't think either
of you were going to be here.

07:41.451 --> 07:42.885
Now I don't have to drop
Emma off at the babysitter.

07:44.904 --> 07:46.839
(muffled laughter)

07:46.890 --> 07:48.807
Why would you want somebody
to sit on your baby?

07:50.877 --> 07:52.778
Is he always like that?

07:52.812 --> 07:54.613
What are you, Peter Pan?

07:54.664 --> 07:56.598
(stammering)

07:56.649 --> 07:57.649
He's like...
like...

07:58.701 --> 08:00.569
He's like a robot, like a Benbot.

08:00.603 --> 08:01.637
(babbles)

08:03.406 --> 08:04.540
- I'm Ben Wheeler.
- Say something else.

08:04.542 --> 08:06.475
I'm so mad, I'm gonna
put my hands on my hips.

08:06.526 --> 08:08.527
Rawr!

08:08.561 --> 08:11.463
Okay, looks like someone's
back is feeling better.

08:11.498 --> 08:13.382
Danny, you can watch Emma, right?

08:14.384 --> 08:16.368
And sit on your baby!

08:16.402 --> 08:18.670
I just got that!

08:20.723 --> 08:22.658
Emma, pack your bag! We're
getting the hell out of here!

08:28.631 --> 08:29.765
Hey, sorry I'm late.

08:29.799 --> 08:31.567
I went to go pick up Penny some flowers,

08:31.601 --> 08:33.534
but they were ten bucks,
so I ditched that idea.

08:34.671 --> 08:36.554
Well, Penny's not coming, Ben.

08:36.589 --> 08:37.623
What? Why not?

08:37.657 --> 08:39.625
Because you're not ready for Penny.

08:39.659 --> 08:41.477
Well, then why am I here?

08:41.510 --> 08:43.544
Okay, I did an analysis,
and I found that there's

08:43.580 --> 08:46.515
one thing every failed relationship
you've ever had has in common.

08:46.566 --> 08:47.833
- What's that?
- You.

08:49.419 --> 08:50.803
You have to face the facts.

08:50.854 --> 08:52.654
I mean, when it comes to meeting women,

08:52.705 --> 08:53.889
you're all look and no listen.

08:53.923 --> 08:55.641
Thank you.

08:56.726 --> 08:58.660
It's... not a compliment.

08:59.813 --> 09:02.664
This just proves that we
need to build a better Ben.

09:02.699 --> 09:05.601
All right, so, let's do a little test.

09:05.603 --> 09:07.619
Hi. I'm Brie.

09:07.654 --> 09:10.489
I'm from Alaska, and I love skiing

09:10.523 --> 09:11.707
and archeology.

09:11.741 --> 09:15.477
Okay, now ask me a question
about something I just said.

09:15.512 --> 09:17.846
Whoa.

09:17.881 --> 09:20.833
"Seven days of sexy bras."
Riley, go to page 92 real quick.

09:23.403 --> 09:26.622
It's like trying to train
a dog to use a typewriter.

09:26.673 --> 09:27.806
Only harder.

09:31.628 --> 09:32.644
Oh, my god, no!

09:37.381 --> 09:38.481
Grab it, and...

09:38.532 --> 09:40.249
(groans)

09:41.435 --> 09:43.369
Do not take being young for granted.

09:43.371 --> 09:46.606
Some mornings, my boobs
touch my toes before I do.

09:47.625 --> 09:49.258
Good morning, ladies.

09:49.293 --> 09:51.561
Now, who is ready for a beautiful day?

09:51.612 --> 09:52.645
Answer: me.

09:52.647 --> 09:54.163
Because I slept
like a guy who...

09:54.214 --> 09:55.632
Smoked two joints, ate four pizzas,

09:55.683 --> 09:58.651
and told the guy in 2C that
culottes are making a comeback?

09:58.686 --> 10:01.487
I should not have bought ten
pairs of those online last night.

10:01.489 --> 10:03.423
But I feel great.

10:03.457 --> 10:04.624
I can't wait to get to
practice. Thanks a lot, Mom.

10:04.626 --> 10:06.476
- Bye, honey.
- Bye.

10:06.527 --> 10:07.543
(door closes)

10:07.578 --> 10:11.397
Now remember, Emma, drugs
are never the answer.

10:12.416 --> 10:14.250
Unless the question is,

10:14.301 --> 10:17.203
"How come Grandma went to Mexico on
her honeymoon and didn't get a tan?"

10:18.389 --> 10:19.639
It's a thinker, it's okay.

10:21.275 --> 10:22.625
Hey, Mom, how do I look?

10:22.660 --> 10:25.228
I'm about to go meet the future
Mrs. Ben Wheeler for lunch.

10:25.262 --> 10:27.246
Riley stayed up all night
building a better me.

10:27.297 --> 10:28.581
And I know what you're thinking,

10:28.583 --> 10:29.682
"How do you improve upon this?"

10:29.717 --> 10:31.567
Hm. Not what I was thinking.

10:32.636 --> 10:34.587
But she did, and now I'm ready to meet her.

10:34.589 --> 10:35.688
Okay?

10:35.739 --> 10:37.523
All right, Emma. I'll see
you later. Wish me luck.

10:37.525 --> 10:39.492
Oh, one more thing.

10:39.526 --> 10:41.444
I know you're the one
who wrote "Bonnie Rules"

10:41.478 --> 10:43.429
in spray cheese in the
hallway. Clean it up.

10:46.316 --> 10:47.350
Well, Bonnie does rule.

10:48.385 --> 10:50.236
All right, come on. (groans)

10:50.287 --> 10:52.255
Oh, god. Emma.

10:52.289 --> 10:53.306
Oh, my god, my back.

10:53.357 --> 10:55.324
All right, I'm going down. I'm going down.

10:55.359 --> 10:56.659
I'm going down. Emma, clear.

10:56.694 --> 10:58.211
I'm going down, I'm going down.

10:58.262 --> 10:59.579
(grunts)

10:59.613 --> 11:00.646
Oh, Emma.

11:00.648 --> 11:03.549
Emma, do you know how
to open the refrigerator?

11:04.568 --> 11:06.619
The Chardonnay's on the top shelf, run.

11:06.670 --> 11:07.603
Run!

11:08.605 --> 11:10.456
Which is why owning a bar is great.

11:10.491 --> 11:13.393
I mean, of course it's nowhere near
as impressive as being a lawyer.

11:13.395 --> 11:14.394
What's your specialty?

11:14.445 --> 11:16.396
Oh, my god, did you hear that?

11:16.430 --> 11:19.282
He brought the conversation back to her.

11:19.316 --> 11:20.400
My heart is so full right now.

11:24.271 --> 11:26.372
Is it me or is it really hot in here?

11:29.243 --> 11:30.243
So, um...

11:31.261 --> 11:33.246
you were saying something about... the law?

11:33.280 --> 11:34.230
Yeah.

11:34.281 --> 11:35.832
I loved law school.

11:35.866 --> 11:37.683
<i>- I went to the University of Rhode Island...
- (Thinking) Don't look down.</i>

11:37.718 --> 11:39.469
<i>- (continues talking)
- Don't look down.</i>

11:39.503 --> 11:40.536
<i>Dude, come on.</i>

11:40.571 --> 11:42.438
family program for their law school.

11:42.473 --> 11:43.723
<i>Oh, no, what did she say?</i>

11:43.774 --> 11:46.375
<i>Something about Rhode Island?
Say something about Rhode Island!</i>

11:46.410 --> 11:47.477
I love Rhode Island!

11:49.530 --> 11:51.264
<i>(thinking) Nailed it.</i>

11:51.298 --> 11:52.398
<i>I wonder if those are real.</i>

11:52.433 --> 11:54.383
He's out, Riley.

11:54.418 --> 11:55.685
I lost him.

11:55.719 --> 11:57.353
What? No, no, no. Penny, come on!

11:57.387 --> 11:59.372
No! I was just momentarily distracted.

11:59.406 --> 12:01.240
God!

12:01.275 --> 12:02.308
I can't believe I blew it.

12:02.342 --> 12:03.609
It's okay.

12:03.644 --> 12:05.278
You know, I knew you would.

12:05.280 --> 12:06.629
So, that was a practice Penny.

12:08.182 --> 12:10.216
What? You expected me to fail?

12:10.250 --> 12:12.635
Oh, come on. Even you expected you to fail.

12:12.669 --> 12:15.571
Okay, well if you think you know me
so well, what am I thinking right now?

12:15.606 --> 12:17.457
You're wondering if they're real or not.

12:17.459 --> 12:18.508
Okay, well what am I thinking right now?

12:18.559 --> 12:19.592
- Same thing.
- Damn it.

12:22.379 --> 12:23.412
Hey, Mom.

12:23.447 --> 12:24.430
Hey, honey.

12:24.432 --> 12:27.366
Mom, I just had my best
practice of the season.

12:27.401 --> 12:28.417
Even the coach noticed.

12:28.469 --> 12:29.852
Yeah, really? What'd he say?

12:29.887 --> 12:33.339
Nothing. But he usually says I suck,
so "nothing" is a huge improvement.

12:33.341 --> 12:35.274
Oh, and get this,

12:35.276 --> 12:37.376
I found out that we're gonna have
a drug test before the game tonight,

12:37.378 --> 12:40.229
so how lucky is it that we smoked
last night, not this morning?

12:41.281 --> 12:42.615
What? Danny!

12:42.666 --> 12:45.635
Marijuana stays in your
system for like two weeks.

12:45.686 --> 12:48.654
If it didn't, I would be an air
traffic controller right now.

12:48.705 --> 12:50.556
What?

12:50.591 --> 12:52.441
No, no, no. This isn't happening!

12:52.493 --> 12:55.378
The first time I do the pot,
I totally ruin my career?

12:55.429 --> 12:56.462
This is all your fault.

12:56.464 --> 12:57.563
Okay, all right, Danny, just relax.

12:57.598 --> 12:59.499
Okay, you hardly smoked any, all right?

12:59.533 --> 13:02.468
Hey, although a puff or two right
now might calm you right down.

13:02.503 --> 13:04.237
Mom! Drug test!

13:04.288 --> 13:05.505
All right, you're right, you're right.

13:05.539 --> 13:08.257
You know what, people outsmart
these tests all the time.

13:08.308 --> 13:09.358
We just have to find out how they do it.

13:09.409 --> 13:11.210
Okay.

13:11.245 --> 13:13.179
"How to pass a drug test."

13:13.213 --> 13:14.330
No, not rug test.

13:14.364 --> 13:17.216
Oh, my gosh, these are some nice rugs.

13:17.267 --> 13:19.152
I should probably just totally
rearrange my living room.

13:19.203 --> 13:20.253
$400,
are you...

13:20.255 --> 13:21.637
Mom! Come on, focus!

13:21.672 --> 13:23.523
Yeah, yeah, yeah, honey.
I'm sorry, I might have had

13:23.574 --> 13:24.624
one too many of those cookies earlier.

13:25.659 --> 13:27.476
Wait, these cookies?

13:28.545 --> 13:30.546
Danny! No! Oh, god!

13:30.581 --> 13:32.431
What is wrong with you?

13:32.482 --> 13:34.400
Those cookies are full of pot.

13:34.402 --> 13:35.585
What?

13:35.619 --> 13:38.254
Who would bake pot into
perfectly innocent cookies?

13:39.473 --> 13:42.308
It was probably that awful Mary Jane.

13:44.661 --> 13:46.679
I am gonna go find her,

13:46.713 --> 13:49.615
and when I do, I am gonna
give her a piece of my mind.

13:54.713 --> 13:57.765
Pulled a lot of strings with my boss
to get us into the firm's skybox,

13:57.800 --> 13:59.367
so do not let me down, Wheeler.

13:59.401 --> 14:00.752
Otherwise, the next box that I get you into

14:00.786 --> 14:02.637
will have handles on the side.

14:02.671 --> 14:04.739
Oh, she of little faith, I got this.

14:04.773 --> 14:07.558
And if I don't, I got the popcorn
girl's number just in case.

14:07.626 --> 14:09.560
(chuckles) I'm just... totally kidding.

14:11.630 --> 14:12.597
Penny!

14:12.631 --> 14:14.465
Find a Penny, pick her up.

14:14.516 --> 14:15.516
Don't say that.

14:15.518 --> 14:17.452
Penny, hi. Uh, this is Ben.

14:17.503 --> 14:18.586
Hi, pleasure to meet you.

14:18.620 --> 14:21.356
Hi, Ben. Riley's told me a lot about you.

14:21.358 --> 14:23.358
Oh, well you know, she's
a notorious liar, so...

14:23.392 --> 14:24.459
Don't worry, it was all good.

14:24.493 --> 14:26.361
Like I said, she's a notorious liar.

14:26.363 --> 14:27.762
(chuckles) I can't wait to hear about you.

14:29.348 --> 14:30.365
<i>(thinking) Wow.</i>

14:30.399 --> 14:31.783
<i>She has beautiful eyes.</i>

14:31.834 --> 14:33.735
<i>There's something you don't see everyday.</i>

14:33.769 --> 14:35.319
<i>Quick, do something nice.</i>

14:35.371 --> 14:36.671
Let me hang that up for you.

14:37.689 --> 14:39.574
Oh, you know what, hey, why don't I do it?

14:39.608 --> 14:41.592
I mean, I seem to be
standing in the way anyway.

14:41.627 --> 14:43.628
And now I'm just standing
here talking to myself.

14:43.662 --> 14:45.646
So, might as well go drink by myself.

14:47.549 --> 14:48.583
Up high,

14:48.634 --> 14:51.469
down low, real slow.

14:51.537 --> 14:52.587
(chuckles)

14:52.621 --> 14:54.389
Yeah.

14:54.440 --> 14:55.473
- Danny.
- What?

14:55.524 --> 14:57.325
- Danny.
- Huh? What?

14:57.376 --> 14:59.427
I G-O-T the pee.

15:01.313 --> 15:02.413
You got goat pee?

15:02.448 --> 15:03.748
Oh, god!

15:03.782 --> 15:06.434
No! Just regular pee, you big stoner.

15:06.468 --> 15:08.736
Okay. All right, this is Emma's.

15:08.787 --> 15:11.305
And unless she's sparking
up behind our backs,

15:11.340 --> 15:12.340
it's clean.

15:12.342 --> 15:13.608
So, um...

15:13.610 --> 15:14.742
just sneak this into your drug test, okay?

15:14.777 --> 15:16.627
Oh, my god, Mom, thank you so much!

15:16.678 --> 15:17.762
I couldn't have done it without you.

15:17.796 --> 15:19.647
Oh, wait, wait.

15:19.649 --> 15:20.715
Someone else is hugging you.

15:20.749 --> 15:21.716
Oh.

15:21.718 --> 15:24.652
Oh, never mind, it was just my other hand.

15:26.655 --> 15:28.506
Ah, you're the best Mom ever.

15:28.557 --> 15:30.491
Well, actually, the best Mom
would be the one who didn't

15:30.526 --> 15:31.476
tell you to smoke a bunch of weed.

15:32.561 --> 15:33.594
Wait.

15:33.596 --> 15:36.397
- Where's the bottle?
- What bottle?

15:36.432 --> 15:39.434
The bottle! The bottle that
is gonna save your career.

15:39.485 --> 15:40.768
Stop that!

15:40.770 --> 15:41.786
All right.

15:41.820 --> 15:43.721
Oh, my god, Danny, do
you know how hard it is

15:43.755 --> 15:46.324
to get a baby to pee into a funnel?

15:46.358 --> 15:48.376
Okay, don't worry, I will
find it. Just stay here and...

15:48.410 --> 15:49.760
(whispers) try not to act high. Okay?

15:57.753 --> 15:59.554
I'm not high.

16:02.458 --> 16:03.558
Quit looking at me.

16:05.544 --> 16:08.396
You know what, I'm really glad we met.

16:08.398 --> 16:10.281
You're a great listener

16:10.315 --> 16:12.467
and might I add, definitely
one of the good guys.

16:12.501 --> 16:15.753
Mm, thanks. It's not easy for us nice
guys to get the recognition we deserve.

16:16.805 --> 16:17.755
Oh, no.

16:17.806 --> 16:19.690
Is everything okay?

16:19.725 --> 16:21.659
Ben, I am so glad I found you.

16:21.693 --> 16:23.628
Uh, Mom, this is Penny. Penny, Mom.

16:23.679 --> 16:25.563
Also, Mom, that's the door.

16:25.597 --> 16:27.648
Door, Mom. Mom, door!

16:27.683 --> 16:30.501
Your brother is high as a kite
right now and he needs your help.

16:30.536 --> 16:31.569
(snorts)

16:31.620 --> 16:32.653
Could you excuse us for just two seconds?

16:35.557 --> 16:36.641
Mom,

16:36.692 --> 16:39.510
I did not spend the last
48 hours de-Ben-ing myself

16:39.545 --> 16:41.395
so you could Wheeler me back in.

16:41.430 --> 16:44.465
Just whiz into this bottle so your
brother will pass his drug test

16:44.467 --> 16:45.466
and he can stay on the team.

16:45.517 --> 16:46.801
All right, and then I'll be on my way.

16:46.835 --> 16:48.753
- I just went, I'm all tapped out.
- (scoffs)

16:48.787 --> 16:49.754
What am I supposed to do?

16:49.805 --> 16:51.372
Just walk up to some random stranger

16:51.406 --> 16:52.773
and ask if I can borrow a cup of pee?

16:52.775 --> 16:54.375
I already tried that.

16:55.394 --> 16:56.694
Is everything okay?

16:57.746 --> 16:58.713
What about her?

16:58.747 --> 16:59.730
No.

17:03.635 --> 17:05.486
(grunts) Fine.

17:05.521 --> 17:06.654
(chuckles)

17:06.688 --> 17:08.589
Hey, um, Penny,

17:08.624 --> 17:10.473
this is actually pretty funny.

17:10.559 --> 17:13.361
Uh, but I was wondering if I could ask
you just a quick teensy, weensy favor

17:13.412 --> 17:15.463
that isn't weird at all.

17:15.513 --> 17:18.449
Will you mind, uh, filling
this bottle with your urine

17:18.483 --> 17:20.468
so my brother doesn't fail his drug test?

17:23.372 --> 17:24.405
I'll hold your wine.

17:31.380 --> 17:32.713
Hey. Hey.

17:32.715 --> 17:33.714
Have you seen Danny Wheeler?

17:33.765 --> 17:35.650
Yeah. He's passed out in the training room.

17:35.701 --> 17:38.669
If he doesn't turn his cup in in
five minutes, he'll get suspended.

17:39.805 --> 17:41.572
Oh, my god. What am I gonna do?

17:48.680 --> 17:50.464
Game on.

17:53.418 --> 17:54.502
(deep voice) Wheeler.

17:55.537 --> 17:56.571
All right, time to go.

17:56.605 --> 17:58.406
Let's hit the ice!

17:58.440 --> 18:00.458
(all cheering)

18:00.509 --> 18:03.361
Bonnie: Wait a second, I
forgot to put on my cup!

18:07.432 --> 18:09.734
I'm sorry. I screwed up.

18:09.768 --> 18:11.702
Any way that was also a fake Penny?

18:11.737 --> 18:13.271
Nope.

18:13.322 --> 18:16.557
You asked the actual girl
to pee in a water bottle.

18:16.559 --> 18:17.725
But you know what,

18:17.776 --> 18:19.660
you aren't the only one
that screwed this up.

18:19.711 --> 18:23.481
I can't believe I forgot to
factor in the whole Wheeler family.

18:23.515 --> 18:24.749
I can change you as much as I want,

18:24.800 --> 18:28.536
but it takes a pretty special
person to love all the Wheelers.

18:28.587 --> 18:31.422
You should know. You kind of
have loved all the Wheelers.

18:31.456 --> 18:32.757
Shut it.

18:35.344 --> 18:36.360
Look,

18:36.395 --> 18:38.746
Riley, I may be all look and no listen,

18:38.780 --> 18:41.415
but I'm also all love and no judgment.

18:41.450 --> 18:44.669
And that is the kind of person I
need to find for Emma and for me.

18:44.703 --> 18:46.520
The bottom line is

18:46.555 --> 18:49.624
if you don't find a guy asking you to
pee in a bottle on the first date funny,

18:49.675 --> 18:50.791
then I'm not the guy for you.

18:50.793 --> 18:54.745
I need a girl who likes me for me.

18:54.796 --> 18:57.665
I'm sure she's out there somewhere
and when the time's right,

18:57.699 --> 18:59.533
we'll find each other.

18:59.584 --> 19:01.419
Wow.

19:01.470 --> 19:03.437
That was really deep.

19:03.439 --> 19:05.356
Honey, um, hi.

19:05.390 --> 19:06.540
What... What are you doing?
What are you doing up here?

19:06.542 --> 19:08.342
Aren't you supposed to be down there?

19:08.377 --> 19:09.443
Wait, isn't that you?

19:09.478 --> 19:10.528
Wow.

19:10.562 --> 19:12.330
I'm playing great.

19:12.381 --> 19:13.381
- (crashing)
- (Crowd groans)

19:14.433 --> 19:16.450
Get up, Danny! Get up!

19:18.754 --> 19:20.438
(Zoey laughs)

19:20.472 --> 19:23.357
I can't believe you asked your date
to pee in a cup. That's hilarious.

19:23.359 --> 19:24.675
Right? Thank you.

19:27.696 --> 19:29.580
Oh, I, um... I
almost forgot. Um...

19:30.666 --> 19:32.316
Here's that bottle you wanted to borrow.

19:32.351 --> 19:35.569
Thanks. I'm completely out, I don't
know where they keep disappearing to.

19:35.604 --> 19:37.705
Just be glad you don't have
roommates that steal them for beer.

19:37.739 --> 19:38.723
(both chuckle)

19:39.758 --> 19:41.609
Anything else I can do for you?

19:44.646 --> 19:47.481
Uh, no. That was it.

19:47.532 --> 19:48.666
I'll see you around.

19:48.700 --> 19:49.650
Okay.

19:53.655 --> 19:55.539
So much for that idea.

19:59.745 --> 20:01.545
Mommy!

20:01.580 --> 20:03.581
Yeah, I'm sorry, baby. That's not Mama.

20:03.632 --> 20:04.715
That's just a friend.

20:04.750 --> 20:06.667
I don't think she sees me that way.

20:06.718 --> 20:08.636
Hey, where you going, huh?

20:13.924 --> 20:15.175
Oh, there you are.

20:15.209 --> 20:17.043
I've been meaning to thank you
for helping me out last night.

20:17.094 --> 20:18.128
But I am done.

20:18.212 --> 20:19.929
I've learned my lesson.

20:19.964 --> 20:21.931
I am not using mind-altering
substances anymore.

20:24.935 --> 20:26.102
Well, that's nice, honey.

20:26.137 --> 20:28.888
But you know what would really
help you learn your lesson?

20:28.890 --> 20:30.890
Being suspended for three games.

20:30.941 --> 20:32.025
- What?
- Yeah, it turns out

20:32.059 --> 20:34.027
that Penny Paulsen was
a bit of a pothead, so...

20:34.061 --> 20:37.063
Oh, god, my back. It's still killing me.

20:37.114 --> 20:39.032
(sighs deeply) Ow.

20:39.066 --> 20:40.984
Take two of these and
call me in the morning.

20:49.555 --> 20:51.690
And the student becomes the master.
