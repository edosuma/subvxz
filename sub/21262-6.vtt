Mommy, did you get a present
for Oscar's birthday?

00:06.106 --> 00:08.508
No, you know, his mommies told
me not to get a present,

00:08.575 --> 00:10.176
so, lovely, we're just
going to get a book

00:10.243 --> 00:11.911
and they're gonna
donate it to the library.

00:11.978 --> 00:13.880
One of my books?

00:11.978 --> 00:13.880
No, don't worry.

00:13.947 --> 00:17.784
Your 3,000 books for one small
human are completely safe.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.926
Yes, mom, they are
a lesbian couple

00:26.993 --> 00:28.828
and their son Oscar
is in Amelia's class.

00:28.895 --> 00:32.232
Remember when we had gay dogs?

00:28.895 --> 00:32.232
Wow!

00:32.298 --> 00:33.600
Just so you know--

00:32.298 --> 00:33.600
What?

00:33.666 --> 00:35.001
just if you're out
in mixed company--

00:35.068 --> 00:37.237
Yeah?

00:35.068 --> 00:37.237
Going from a lesbian couple to

00:37.303 --> 00:41.941
"remember we had gay dogs"--
not necessarily the best leap.

00:42.008 --> 00:44.043
Do you remember when Abe
used to shove his stuff

00:44.110 --> 00:47.046
into Silver's face
and force him to do things?

00:47.113 --> 00:48.948
Yeah, do you remember
how poor Silver

00:49.015 --> 00:51.751
had to stick his little head
in the rails of the banister

00:51.818 --> 00:53.119
just to get a moment's peace?

00:53.186 --> 00:54.954
It was very
traumatizing to me.

00:55.021 --> 00:58.091
Abe was on his last legs when
we got him, and then what?

00:58.158 --> 01:00.994
He lived five more years.

00:58.158 --> 01:00.994
Yeah, 'cause he was gettin'...

01:02.829 --> 01:05.432

you know.

01:05.498 --> 01:08.001
Either way.

01:05.498 --> 01:08.001
And I'm not sure
that has the same effect.

01:08.067 --> 01:10.336
Come to think of it,
was Silver really gay?

01:10.403 --> 01:11.604
You know what, he wasn't,

01:11.671 --> 01:12.806
because he had
no choice in the matter.

01:12.872 --> 01:14.607
He was more "gay for stay".

01:14.674 --> 01:15.975

01:29.189 --> 01:30.190
Why isn't she dancing?

01:30.256 --> 01:32.992
Because after begging me
to take dance class,

01:33.059 --> 01:34.861
Amelia decided
she just wanted to watch.

01:34.928 --> 01:37.330
So, you just sit here
every week for 45 minutes?

01:37.397 --> 01:39.065
Yeah, that's what happens
because when we make

01:39.132 --> 01:41.334

we stick to it, right?

hasn't come out,

that doesn't really help.

Nick his roommate, right?

04:17.557 --> 04:19.592

07:47.934 --> 07:50.736
I just don't have that many gay
people in my everyday life

07:50.803 --> 07:54.073
so that I can understand
all the nuances, you know?

07:54.140 --> 07:55.474
Well, you got one person.

07:55.541 --> 07:57.243
No, no, no, no,
cousin June isn't gay,

07:57.310 --> 07:58.845
she just runs a juice bar.

07:58.911 --> 08:00.980
Mom, no one thinks
cousin June's gay,

08:01.047 --> 08:02.982
especially not because
she runs a juice bar.

08:03.049 --> 08:04.784
That's what I said,
she's not gay.

08:04.851 --> 08:06.419
Who, who were
you thinking of?

08:06.485 --> 08:08.888
Come on.

08:08.955 --> 08:11.190
Do you really not know?

08:08.955 --> 08:11.190
What?

08:11.257 --> 08:13.826
David.

08:11.257 --> 08:13.826
My son, David?

08:13.893 --> 08:16.195
And my brother David?
Yeah.

08:16.262 --> 08:18.231
What makes you
think David is gay?

08:18.297 --> 08:20.867
He's so... masculine.

08:20.933 --> 08:23.002
Masculine people can be gay.

08:23.069 --> 08:25.404
Well, not David,
David's not gay.

08:25.471 --> 08:27.840
Mom, he's in his 30's,
he's never had a girlfriend.

08:27.907 --> 08:30.042
He's a computer engineer.

08:30.109 --> 08:31.711
You can't use
that excuse forever.

08:31.777 --> 08:34.013
He's always going on
about Nick

08:34.080 --> 08:35.381
and how much fun
they have together,

08:35.448 --> 08:37.416
and they're spending
weekends together.

08:37.483 --> 08:41.120
Mom, come on.

08:37.483 --> 08:41.120
Oh, my gosh, Nick.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.722
He loves Nick.

08:42.788 --> 08:45.658
I think Nick
is his boyfriend.

08:45.725 --> 08:48.094
Oh, I hope he's not gay.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.263
Mom!
Why would you say that?

08:50.329 --> 08:52.565
I don't have a problem
with gay people, you know that.

08:52.632 --> 08:56.802
I know that!

08:52.632 --> 08:56.802
It's just that it's a harder
life, and he's my son.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.170
I get that.

08:58.237 --> 09:00.006
Mommy, aren't you
going to draw?

09:00.072 --> 09:03.876
Sorry! We are drawing
stuff in nature.

09:03.943 --> 09:05.511
Here.

09:05.578 --> 09:09.682
Mom, it's 2017, it's not
as hard as it used to be.

09:09.749 --> 09:11.450
Yes, it is.

09:11.517 --> 09:13.319
It's harder to get married,
it's harder to have kids.

09:13.386 --> 09:16.489
And you know what, it's harder
to get a wedding cake.

09:16.555 --> 09:18.291
What are you talking about?

09:18.357 --> 09:19.525
I'm not joking,
I saw it on the news.

09:19.592 --> 09:21.460
There are very
homophobic bakeries,

09:21.527 --> 09:23.429
and you know how much
David loves cake.

09:23.496 --> 09:26.565
But mom, if he's gay,
don't you want to do it now

09:26.632 --> 09:28.301
and not waste
any more time?

09:28.367 --> 09:30.236
I don't know.

09:30.303 --> 09:32.271
If anything, it's gonna
work out the best for you

09:32.338 --> 09:33.873
because then you don't
just have to rely on me

09:33.940 --> 09:36.309
when you're old and decrepit,
like a year from now.

09:36.375 --> 09:38.911
He'll make sure
your hair looks good,

09:38.978 --> 09:40.713
he'll take you on
some cruises.

09:40.780 --> 09:43.015
No, no, no, I don't
think he's cruise gay.

09:43.082 --> 09:45.918
He'd probably make me go on
a tour of the Boeing factory.

09:45.985 --> 09:47.420
That's true.

09:47.486 --> 09:49.522
But you'll also have
someone to fix your scanner.

09:49.588 --> 09:52.725
Oh, I do hate that
fucking scanner.

09:52.792 --> 09:54.727
Mom, what are you drawing?

09:54.794 --> 09:57.296
What? It's the lemon tree that
you and David used to climb.

09:57.363 --> 09:58.497
It's something in nature.

09:58.564 --> 10:01.300
What are those
things at the trunk?

10:01.367 --> 10:03.035
Those are lemons
that fell off the tree.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.404
Those are... large lemons.

10:05.471 --> 10:07.239
Why? What do you think it is?

10:07.306 --> 10:09.875
David, Nick.

10:07.306 --> 10:09.875
What?

10:09.942 --> 10:11.744
Boom!

10:09.942 --> 10:11.744
Oh, my God.

10:11.811 --> 10:14.947
Maybe this is your subconscious
becoming okay with this.

10:15.014 --> 10:17.550
If it is, could we at least
say that this is David

10:17.616 --> 10:21.053
and this is Nick, because David
was always such a go-getter.

10:21.120 --> 10:24.090
If that makes you feel better,
mom, you can definitely say

10:24.156 --> 10:27.426
that David is jamming
himself into Nick.

10:27.493 --> 10:30.563
I am done drawing.
What are we doing next?

10:30.629 --> 10:33.332
Come on, monkey, off the bed.

10:30.629 --> 10:33.332
Get off the bed.

10:33.399 --> 10:35.368
Are you excited to have your
play date with Oscar today?

10:35.434 --> 10:37.103
I don't play with Oscar much.

10:37.169 --> 10:38.337
You don't have to play
with him much,

10:38.404 --> 10:39.705
you just have to play
with him today.

10:39.772 --> 10:41.340
Yeah, you'll have
fun when you get there.

10:41.407 --> 10:44.043
By the way, Oscar's mommies
told me the Coop is...

10:44.110 --> 10:46.779
[singsong]
...amazing!

10:46.846 --> 10:49.782
Do Oscar's mommies
sleep in the same bed?

10:49.849 --> 10:52.618
Uh, of course.

10:52.685 --> 10:54.954
They love each other, so I'm
sure that they like to snuggle

10:55.021 --> 10:56.322
just like me and daddy do.

10:56.389 --> 10:58.457
That's funny.

10:58.524 --> 11:00.059
Well, I don't think
it's funny, I just think

11:00.126 --> 11:01.794
it's a little different.

11:01.861 --> 11:04.397
I agree, and I also agree that
I'm totally going to tickle you

11:04.463 --> 11:06.399
if you don't get ready to go!

11:06.465 --> 11:07.933
I have to say, I'm glad
we have this play date.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.268
Yeah, me too.

11:09.335 --> 11:10.536
I mean, I feel
like good role models

11:10.603 --> 11:12.004
is the way this
is gonna sink in.

11:12.071 --> 11:13.739
I hope so.

11:13.806 --> 11:17.076
You know, I actually wouldn't
mind if Amelia was a lesbian.

11:17.143 --> 11:18.677
Really?

11:17.143 --> 11:18.677
Yeah.

11:18.744 --> 11:21.380
Okay, nah, don't act
so cool and open-minded.

11:21.447 --> 11:22.548
I know what you're doing.

11:22.615 --> 11:24.083
Typical dad with a daughter.

11:24.150 --> 11:28.220
You don't want a boy putting
a penis inside her.

11:28.287 --> 11:31.023
Wow, that was really tough to
hear out loud, but totally true.

11:31.090 --> 11:32.992
Well, just so you know,
even if she is a lesbian,

11:33.059 --> 11:35.094
there's still toys,
so there's still going to be

11:35.161 --> 11:36.395
something inside her.

11:36.462 --> 11:38.831
Something to think about.

11:38.898 --> 11:41.367
Oh, man.
She can be asexual.

11:41.434 --> 11:43.869
Bubs, just make sure
you buckle up.

11:43.936 --> 11:45.504
Hey!

11:43.936 --> 11:45.504
Oh, hey!

11:45.571 --> 11:47.139
How are you?

11:45.571 --> 11:47.139
I'm good, how you doing?

11:47.206 --> 11:49.008
I got my shorts on again.

11:49.075 --> 11:50.676
Ah, yeah, you do-- shorts!

11:50.743 --> 11:53.879
Yeah, shorts!

11:50.743 --> 11:53.879
Have a good day.

11:53.946 --> 11:56.215
Hey!

11:53.946 --> 11:56.215
Hey, there.

11:56.282 --> 11:58.651
Bye!

11:56.282 --> 11:58.651
Bye-bye.

11:58.717 --> 12:00.086
I'm just got an email
saying our insurance premium

12:00.152 --> 12:02.254
might go up because of
the whole Pink Mom incident.

12:02.321 --> 12:04.590
Why? I thought you said
there was barely a dent.

12:04.657 --> 12:07.493
She's now claiming
she has medical costs.

12:07.560 --> 12:10.696
Who? Pink Mom?

12:07.560 --> 12:10.696
No, again, Pink Mom fled
the scene-- the woman I hit.

12:10.763 --> 12:12.231
Although, let's be honest,

12:12.298 --> 12:15.067
Pink Mom probably has
some medical costs herself,

12:15.134 --> 12:16.635
mostly psychiatric.

12:16.702 --> 12:18.170
What's this other
woman claiming?

12:18.237 --> 12:20.306
Supposedly she has breast
implants and when I hit her,

12:20.372 --> 12:23.843
the seatbelt, like, jammed in
and caused some sort of damage

12:23.909 --> 12:25.778
that now the insurance
has to cover.

12:25.845 --> 12:27.780
It seems crazy.
How does that even happen?

12:27.847 --> 12:29.915
She didn't seem particularly...
[vocalizing]

12:29.982 --> 12:32.651
...when we exchanged
information, so,

12:32.718 --> 12:34.687
how do we even know she had
implants in the first place?

12:34.753 --> 12:36.689
It doesn't really matter--
it's why we have insurance.

12:36.755 --> 12:38.591
In matters to me if
our deductible goes up

12:38.657 --> 12:40.726
because of her fake
banged-up boobies.

12:40.793 --> 12:44.797
Well, it's not worth
fighting over, I mean, fine.

12:44.864 --> 12:47.433
Oh, okay...

12:44.864 --> 12:47.433
[indistinct voice on phone]

12:47.500 --> 12:48.934
You need to hear this.

12:49.001 --> 12:51.337
<i>Hey, it's your brother,</i>
<i>listen, um...</i>

12:51.403 --> 12:53.405
<i>I really need to talk</i>
<i>to you about something--</i>

12:53.472 --> 12:55.341
<i>it's not bad or anything,</i>
<i>but it's just the other day</i>

12:55.407 --> 12:58.210
<i>you said how you really</i>
<i>liked Nick and, uh, anyway,</i>

12:58.277 --> 13:01.013
<i>are you free to meet up</i>
<i>later and talk about this?</i>

13:01.080 --> 13:02.715
<i>Just let me know.</i>
<i>Bye.</i>

13:02.781 --> 13:05.417
Okay, he sounds weird, right?

13:05.484 --> 13:07.386
I think this
might be the moment.

13:07.453 --> 13:08.954
What moment?

13:09.021 --> 13:13.192
The moment he reveals himself
to me as a homosexual.

13:13.259 --> 13:16.162
What makes you think that if he
does come out, you'd be the one?

13:16.228 --> 13:18.764
Because I'm his sister and he
feels comfortable around me,

13:18.831 --> 13:20.833
and this is the face
of no judgement.

13:20.900 --> 13:23.235
Mm-hmm.

13:20.900 --> 13:23.235
This is the face of judgement.

13:23.302 --> 13:24.436
<i>Nyah!</i>

13:24.503 --> 13:25.538
And this is the face
of surprise.

13:25.604 --> 13:27.239
[gasping]

13:27.306 --> 13:29.408
And this is my pretty face.

13:29.475 --> 13:30.943
Mommy, that is not pretty.

13:31.010 --> 13:36.048
What, is it too pretty?

13:31.010 --> 13:36.048
Yes, it's too pretty.

13:36.115 --> 13:37.049
Did you hear that?

13:37.116 --> 13:40.486
That was sarcasm.
Oh, my God!

13:40.553 --> 13:41.921
This is the best day
of my life.

13:44.456 --> 13:48.360
[kids laughing and playing]

13:48.427 --> 13:50.563
Whoa, look at that dolphin!

13:50.629 --> 13:52.198
Hey!

13:52.264 --> 13:53.799
You made it!

13:52.264 --> 13:53.799
Amelia...

13:53.866 --> 13:55.935
Have you been practicing?

13:56.001 --> 13:57.102
Up high.

13:57.169 --> 13:58.504
Down low-- oh!

13:58.571 --> 14:02.441
We trained for this!
You blew it!

14:02.508 --> 14:05.177
But we didn't come with nothing.
We brought socks.

14:05.244 --> 14:07.346
Oh, we look very cool.

14:07.413 --> 14:09.915
Someone forgot ours
and we had to buy them.

14:09.982 --> 14:11.417
Oh!

14:09.982 --> 14:11.417
Me!

14:11.483 --> 14:13.252
Ah.

14:11.483 --> 14:13.252
It's me, I'm the one that

14:13.319 --> 14:15.120
forgot the socks
and then we had to buy them.

14:15.187 --> 14:16.522
I've had--
I've done it before.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.057
It does,
happens all the time.

14:18.123 --> 14:19.625
Amelia, Oscar's in
the ball pit.

14:19.692 --> 14:20.993
He wants to know
if you'll join him.

14:21.060 --> 14:22.828
That sounds fun.

14:22.895 --> 14:26.932
But Mommy, you're not allow to
throw the balls out like that.

14:26.999 --> 14:28.434
That's true.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.469
Why don't you see
if Oscar wants to meet you

14:30.536 --> 14:33.138
in that super cool teepee?

14:33.205 --> 14:34.673
Yeah.

14:33.205 --> 14:34.673
By the way,

14:34.740 --> 14:37.376
I have to make
a reservation for my time.

14:37.443 --> 14:40.546
You don't want to get in that
teepee-- fresh buff.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.381
Yeah?
That's sort of what happens

14:42.448 --> 14:44.650
when you take...
[mouthing words]

14:42.448 --> 14:44.650
You're right.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.820
One of the kids right now
is having crazy visions.

14:47.886 --> 14:49.722
I'm pretty sure it's that girl,
right behind you.

14:49.788 --> 14:52.625
Yeah.

14:49.788 --> 14:52.625
Yeah, she's been acting crazy.

14:56.128 --> 14:58.564
So finally, I hand the menu back
to the waiter and he says--

14:58.631 --> 15:01.367
That-- that's not--
she's telling it wrong.

15:01.433 --> 15:02.968
You had the menu.

15:03.035 --> 15:05.037
Do you want to tell it?

15:03.035 --> 15:05.037
No, I don't want to--

15:05.104 --> 15:07.573
You go ahead, you tell it,
it's your story.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.742
Tell it wrong,
but go ahead.

15:09.808 --> 15:13.245
No, after you,
you tell the story.

15:13.312 --> 15:16.515
You know what, we actually
went to that same restaurant

15:16.582 --> 15:18.784
and didn't we have
a strange waiter too?

15:18.851 --> 15:21.387
Yeah, right.

15:18.851 --> 15:21.387
I think they just have
a strange staff of--

15:21.453 --> 15:23.689
Mommy...

15:21.453 --> 15:23.689
Oh, hi, Bubs.

15:23.756 --> 15:24.957
What happened?
Are you okay?

15:25.024 --> 15:26.992
Oscar hit me.

15:27.059 --> 15:29.528
Oh, well, I'm sure that
that was an accident.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.797
I'm sure that
Oscar is very sorry.

15:31.864 --> 15:33.699
No.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.368
"No..." [laughing]

15:33.766 --> 15:36.368
"No."

15:36.435 --> 15:38.070
He loves hitting.

15:38.137 --> 15:41.106
I mean, he loves hitting,
it's like his favorite thing.

15:41.173 --> 15:43.342
Oh!

15:41.173 --> 15:43.342
There he goes.

15:43.409 --> 15:44.777
He's so strong.

15:44.843 --> 15:47.713
It kind of hurts, buddy,
do you want to stop that?

15:47.780 --> 15:49.481
It doesn't look
like he wants to.

15:49.548 --> 15:51.250
You know what,
why don't we have a snack?

15:51.317 --> 15:52.685
Do you want a snack?
Great!

15:52.751 --> 15:54.086
Yeah, you want
some snack, big guy?

15:54.153 --> 15:57.189
You want a fruit bar?

15:57.256 --> 15:59.458
Oh, I forgot them.

15:59.525 --> 16:00.993
So the two things that
you were in charge of,

16:01.060 --> 16:02.795
socks and fruit, you just
decided not to bring?

16:02.861 --> 16:05.798
No, I didn't decide not
to bring-- what I decide,

16:05.864 --> 16:07.333
it was an accident,
people make mistakes.

16:07.399 --> 16:08.901
Tell me what
the difference is.

16:08.967 --> 16:10.903
The difference between
an accident and a decision.

16:10.969 --> 16:12.671
Not here.

16:12.738 --> 16:14.106
We have lots of stuff.

16:14.173 --> 16:16.108
Seriously, have--
we've over-snacked.

16:16.175 --> 16:18.911
Here.

16:16.175 --> 16:18.911
Get in there,
have some pretzels.

16:18.977 --> 16:21.580
Help yourself.

16:21.647 --> 16:24.983
Oscar, why do you have
to take so many pretzels?

16:25.050 --> 16:26.485
That's against the rule.

16:26.552 --> 16:31.557
Well, if Oscar wants
two fistfuls of pretzels,

16:31.623 --> 16:32.791
that's fine, you know,

16:32.858 --> 16:34.393
different families,
different rules.

16:34.460 --> 16:37.062
Yeah, we don't really
have any rules around food.

16:37.129 --> 16:39.331
We don't want to
give him a complex.

16:39.398 --> 16:41.333
Oh, uh-huh.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.602
Hey, little buddy, you actually
need to keep your food

16:43.669 --> 16:45.003
on this side of the rail.

16:45.070 --> 16:46.338
But when you're
done with your snack

16:46.405 --> 16:47.506
you can come back and play.

16:47.573 --> 16:50.342
Excuse me, hey, excuse me.
Problem?

16:50.409 --> 16:52.344
Um, no problem,
we just can't have any food

16:52.411 --> 16:54.713
on this side of the rail.

16:52.411 --> 16:54.713
They have a sign there.

16:54.780 --> 16:56.482
Well, if you have an
issue with something,

16:56.548 --> 16:57.816
why don't you
bring it up to me

16:57.883 --> 16:59.618
instead of talking
to my small kid?

16:59.685 --> 17:01.253
Oh, yeah, of course.

17:01.320 --> 17:03.889
Could we maybe talk to somebody
who's gone through puberty?

17:03.956 --> 17:05.891
I can bring my manager.

17:05.958 --> 17:09.395
Yeah, your manager, yeah, why
don't you go get me the manager?

17:09.461 --> 17:11.130
Yeah, we would love to know
why not letting a child

17:11.196 --> 17:13.298
bring a few pretzels
past an imaginary line

17:13.365 --> 17:14.800
is that big of a deal, okay?

17:14.867 --> 17:16.635
You don't have be
a fucking Nazi about it.

17:16.702 --> 17:20.506
Oh, okay, yeah, I'll...

17:20.572 --> 17:22.941
It's okay, honey.

17:20.572 --> 17:22.941
You're perfect.

17:23.008 --> 17:24.843
[both whispering]
I hate this place.

17:24.910 --> 17:28.447
So the one lesbian couple in our
class turns out to be dickheads?

17:28.514 --> 17:30.149
The way they were
screaming at that guy.

17:30.215 --> 17:32.084
That guy!

17:30.215 --> 17:32.084
I didn't know what to do.

17:32.151 --> 17:33.252
I gave him 20 bucks.

17:33.318 --> 17:35.387
These are the people
that Amelia's looking to

17:35.454 --> 17:37.723
to define a lesbian family?

17:37.790 --> 17:40.726
She's going to think
all lesbians are monsters.

17:40.793 --> 17:42.961
I know, and Jessica
wouldn't let up

17:43.028 --> 17:44.163
on the high five thing
with Amelia.

17:44.229 --> 17:45.998
Right?

17:44.229 --> 17:45.998
Just give her the down low.

17:46.064 --> 17:48.500
Does she think we're walking
away like, ooh, look at Jessica,

17:48.567 --> 17:50.335
cheetah-like reflexes.

17:50.402 --> 17:52.504
Congratulations!
You beat a five-year-old!

17:52.571 --> 17:54.273
Let me have a shot at
her "down low".

17:54.339 --> 17:56.642
Oh, there's a real
fire behind your eyes.

17:56.708 --> 17:58.677
I like it.

17:56.708 --> 17:58.677
Really?

17:58.744 --> 18:00.312
No, it's gone now.

18:00.379 --> 18:03.215
But seriously, how are we
going to keep Amelia from now

18:03.282 --> 18:06.084
just associating
lesbian with asshole

18:06.151 --> 18:08.020
for the rest of her life?

18:08.086 --> 18:10.022
Is it okay that
we're calling them assholes?

18:10.088 --> 18:11.623
I feel like we shouldn't.

18:10.088 --> 18:11.623
Listen...

18:11.690 --> 18:13.926
If that was a straight couple
that we hung out with

18:13.992 --> 18:16.762
and they acted like that
and spoke to people like that,

18:16.829 --> 18:18.697
we would call them assholes.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.265
That's true.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.265
If you think about it,

18:20.332 --> 18:23.469
it's actually more prejudiced
to not call them out

18:23.535 --> 18:24.837
just because they're gay.

18:24.903 --> 18:26.371
If anything,
we're being less prejudiced

18:26.438 --> 18:29.508
by being comfortable enough
to call them assholes.

18:29.575 --> 18:31.043
That oddly makes sense.

18:29.575 --> 18:31.043
Right?

18:31.109 --> 18:32.978
But it still feels
weird calling les--

18:33.045 --> 18:35.981
Mommy, can I have some yogurt?

18:36.048 --> 18:39.785
Uh, yeah, uh, sure, Bubs.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.487
Did you have fun
at your play date today?

18:41.553 --> 18:47.593
Not really-- Oscar hit me and
the two mommies were fighting.

18:47.659 --> 18:48.994
Yeah, well, you know what,

18:49.061 --> 18:50.929
everybody argues
sometimes, right?

18:50.996 --> 18:53.866
I don't think it's
because he's got two mommies.

18:53.932 --> 18:56.935
I know, you and daddy
fight sometimes.

18:57.002 --> 18:59.838
That's true, but we love
each other, and we love you.

18:59.905 --> 19:03.942
Just like Oscar's
mommies love him.

19:04.009 --> 19:07.012
Can I have my yogurt now?

19:07.079 --> 19:10.415
Yeah, sure,
one<i> yogles</i> coming up.

19:10.482 --> 19:11.550
"Yogles"?

19:11.617 --> 19:13.285
Yeah, sorry, actually,

19:13.352 --> 19:15.888
the yogurt industry officially
switched it to "yogles".

19:15.954 --> 19:18.190
People are not happy,
but, uh,

19:18.257 --> 19:21.226
sorry, it's just
there's nothing I can do.

19:21.293 --> 19:23.228
Just when I thought this day
was getting better.

19:27.099 --> 19:29.201
The graphite gets charged
with electricity, okay,

19:29.268 --> 19:30.869
and that generates
its own energy

19:30.936 --> 19:32.437
in the form of heat
and light...

19:32.504 --> 19:34.439
Mm-hmm.

19:32.504 --> 19:34.439
...and that's a lightbulb.

19:34.506 --> 19:36.642
Can you just do me a favor?
I can't do it myself,

19:36.708 --> 19:39.111
but I'm going to close my eyes
and you just hit it real hard.

19:39.177 --> 19:40.212
Yeah, you know,
I wonder why you keep asking me

19:40.279 --> 19:41.980
to explain what
a lightbulb is.

19:42.047 --> 19:43.282
Because it sounds like it's
going to be interesting,

19:43.348 --> 19:45.984
but then somehow
you make it less so.

19:46.051 --> 19:47.853
Thank you very much.

19:46.051 --> 19:47.853
You're welcome.

19:47.920 --> 19:51.323
Okay, so, uh...

19:51.390 --> 19:53.425
There's something I have to
talk to you about, obviously.

19:53.492 --> 19:55.460
And I'm here for you.

19:55.527 --> 19:58.797
Whatever it is, I'm here.

19:55.527 --> 19:58.797
Thank you.

19:58.864 --> 20:02.034
You know my friend Nick, right?

19:58.864 --> 20:02.034
I was saying, I love Nick,

20:02.100 --> 20:03.936
you know that.

20:02.100 --> 20:03.936
Well, Nick and I have gotten

20:04.002 --> 20:06.338
pretty close over
the last year and a half...

20:06.405 --> 20:09.107
Mm-hmm.

20:06.405 --> 20:09.107
...and, um, did you know he was
dating someone named Briana?

20:09.174 --> 20:11.009
Yeah.

20:09.174 --> 20:11.009
Well, they broke up recently.

20:11.076 --> 20:14.713
Okay.

20:11.076 --> 20:14.713
And it has to do with me.

20:14.780 --> 20:17.416
Oh, okay.

20:14.780 --> 20:17.416
Yeah, so now,

20:17.482 --> 20:22.487
I, uh, am dating Briana.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.089
What?

20:22.554 --> 20:24.089
Yeah, I know.

20:24.156 --> 20:26.658
So, I just want to know,
should I be the one to tell him

20:26.725 --> 20:28.093
or should she tell him,
you know,

20:28.160 --> 20:29.361
because I really
like this girl--

20:29.428 --> 20:31.863
I thought you were gay!

20:29.428 --> 20:31.863
What? What?

20:31.930 --> 20:34.132
You thought-- why,
why did you think I was gay?

20:34.199 --> 20:37.069
So... so many reasons!

20:34.199 --> 20:37.069
So many reasons?

20:37.135 --> 20:38.570
First of all,
what's wrong with being gay?

20:38.637 --> 20:40.405
Well, there's nothing,
I just-- because it's--

20:40.472 --> 20:41.940
You've never had a girlfriend,
you're over 30.

20:42.007 --> 20:43.375
That's exactly--
that's all you got?

20:43.442 --> 20:45.344
I'm a computer engineer.

20:43.442 --> 20:45.344
You know what,

20:45.410 --> 20:47.346
that's what mom said, okay,
he's a computer engineer.

20:47.412 --> 20:48.580
I don't think just saying
someone's a computer engineer--

20:48.647 --> 20:50.215
Could you stop a second?
You told mom...

20:50.282 --> 20:51.817
Yeah.

20:50.282 --> 20:51.817
...that I'm gay.

20:51.883 --> 20:56.188
I may have been preparing her
for the possibility.

20:56.254 --> 20:57.589
Okay, what did mom say?

20:57.656 --> 20:59.324
She had some concerns,
I'll be honest.

20:59.391 --> 21:03.495
Um, some bakery concerns
and whatnot, but then,

21:03.562 --> 21:05.530
after a little convincing
I got her on board.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.232
This is insane!
You have to undo this!

21:07.299 --> 21:08.900
I don't-- obviously
I'm gonna tell her,

21:08.967 --> 21:10.168
I'm not just gonna let her
still think you're gay.

21:10.235 --> 21:11.603
Wait, wait,
stop for a second.

21:11.670 --> 21:13.372
How many people know?
How many people did you tell?

21:13.438 --> 21:15.207
Nobody! I'm not going
around like, "He's gay!"

21:15.273 --> 21:18.243
I just-- people assume, Mike
obviously thinks your gay.

21:18.310 --> 21:21.513
Obviously?

21:18.310 --> 21:21.513
Yeah, how do you for sure know,

21:21.580 --> 21:23.715
by the way,
that you're not gay?

21:23.782 --> 21:26.151
Because I'm-- how do you know
you're not gay?

21:26.218 --> 21:27.953
Well, because I've been
there a couple of times

21:28.020 --> 21:29.655
and it's not for me.

21:29.721 --> 21:31.323
You don't mean that--
you've been there?

21:31.390 --> 21:32.691
You've "been there"?
What does that mean?

21:32.758 --> 21:34.393
Where have you been?

21:32.758 --> 21:34.393
Vaginas.

21:34.459 --> 21:36.862
You've been to vagina.

21:34.459 --> 21:36.862
I've been to the vagina store,

21:36.928 --> 21:39.297
and I didn't find anything
I wanted to purchase.

21:39.364 --> 21:40.866
Look, what do I tell Nick,
seriously, though?

21:40.932 --> 21:41.933
Because I don't
want hurt feelings.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.402
I don't give a fuck,

21:43.468 --> 21:45.737
tell him, don't tell him,
who cares?

21:45.804 --> 21:48.273
Obviously I came to
the right person for advice.

21:50.809 --> 21:52.678
I don't think I'm
overstating it when I say

21:52.744 --> 21:54.479
it was the Chernobyl
of play dates.

21:54.546 --> 21:55.847
I think there was
a mass sterilization

21:55.914 --> 21:57.449
that went across the Coop.

21:57.516 --> 22:00.218
Well, I feel it's
worth saying, they're awful.

22:00.285 --> 22:01.553
Seriously?

22:01.620 --> 22:03.155
Brian, why wouldn't
you tell us that

22:03.221 --> 22:04.956
before we made
plans with them?

22:05.023 --> 22:08.293
What, I'm gonna talk shit about
the only gay couple in class?

22:08.360 --> 22:10.362
Yeah, it doesn't feel great.

22:10.429 --> 22:12.164
Now I'm sure they're gonna
want to get together.

22:12.230 --> 22:15.500
I just-- honestly, I don't have
it in me, I cannot do it again.

22:15.567 --> 22:17.169
I don't think you
have to worry about that.

22:17.235 --> 22:18.670
Why? What do you mean?

22:18.737 --> 22:20.672
According to William's mom,
who talked to Jessica,

22:20.739 --> 22:22.774
they don't want to have another
play date with you guys,

22:22.841 --> 22:24.109
so you're in the clear.

22:24.176 --> 22:25.644
Excuse me?

22:25.711 --> 22:28.447
What problem could
they probably have with us?

22:28.513 --> 22:30.115
Well, apparently they
thought that you guys

22:30.182 --> 22:31.783
are a little bit uptight.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.785
We're uptight? Why?
Because we don't let our kids

22:33.852 --> 22:35.987
punch us in the face
and we don't just like,

22:36.054 --> 22:38.156
scream at innocent employees?

22:38.223 --> 22:39.791
Wait a minute,
that's good news.

22:39.858 --> 22:42.160
We don't want to have
more play dates with them.

22:42.227 --> 22:46.465
Right, but... if you could
just let William's mom know

22:46.531 --> 22:47.699
that we are not uptight.

22:47.766 --> 22:49.935
No, she doesn't
care about that.

22:50.001 --> 22:51.470
That's fair.

22:51.536 --> 22:52.804
Still tell her, though.

22:52.871 --> 22:55.607
Hey, William's mom,
she's not uptight.

22:55.674 --> 22:57.409
That's not William's mom,
that's a tree.

22:57.476 --> 22:59.377
I know,
I just wanted to practice.

23:02.214 --> 23:04.416
I know it doesn't
sound great to say it,

23:04.483 --> 23:06.384
but I'm really
relieved he's not gay.

23:06.451 --> 23:08.253
I thought you'd actually
gotten on board with it.

23:08.320 --> 23:10.055
That's when I thought
I had to be.

23:10.122 --> 23:12.157
And besides, I really don't
like Boeing airplanes.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.792
Well, he's going
to be taking you

23:13.859 --> 23:15.427
to that factory either way,
mom, get bored.

23:15.494 --> 23:17.462
I have to say,
I'm a little surprised that

23:17.529 --> 23:20.132
you're back to watching Amelia
watch her dance class again.

23:20.198 --> 23:22.000
Well, if you're going
to be my sole caretaker,

23:22.067 --> 23:23.802
I want to be sure that
I'm on your good side.

23:23.869 --> 23:26.138
Oh, I like where
this is going.

23:26.204 --> 23:27.973
Which reminds me,
I need you to drive me

23:28.039 --> 23:29.775
to the dermatologist
on Thursday.

23:29.841 --> 23:31.476
I'm liking this part less.

23:29.841 --> 23:31.476
What?

23:31.543 --> 23:34.079
I have a little something on my
back, I want them to look at it.

23:34.146 --> 23:36.114
You know that you
still drive, right, mom?

23:36.181 --> 23:37.749
What if they put me under?

23:37.816 --> 23:39.551
To look at something
on your back?

23:39.618 --> 23:40.819
Well, you never know.

23:40.886 --> 23:43.121
I know in this case,
very confident that

23:43.188 --> 23:45.757
they're not going to remove
something from your back

23:45.824 --> 23:47.459
where they have
to put you under--

23:47.526 --> 23:49.060
Oh, now you're a doctor?

23:49.127 --> 23:51.830
If you're a dermatologist
who just immediately goes

23:51.897 --> 23:53.365
from consultation to surgery

23:53.431 --> 23:55.834
and needs you to go under,
call Leon.

23:55.901 --> 23:57.302
Leon's not going
to be around forever.

23:57.369 --> 23:59.871
He'll be around Thursday,
though, right?

23:59.938 --> 24:01.506
Well...

24:01.573 --> 24:04.109
Is Leon okay?

24:01.573 --> 24:04.109
Oh, yeah, Leon's fine.

24:04.176 --> 24:07.179
[woman]
All right, ladies, you are done.

24:07.245 --> 24:10.315
Everyone reach up and...
curtsey.

24:12.751 --> 24:15.687
Here's your snack.

24:15.754 --> 24:18.290
How was class?

24:15.754 --> 24:18.290
It was good.

24:18.356 --> 24:20.926
Great.

24:20.992 --> 24:22.661
Oh, my God,
our deductible's going up.

24:22.727 --> 24:24.329
That is bullshit.

24:22.727 --> 24:24.329
Seriously?

24:24.396 --> 24:26.998
Look, "Please see attachment
for further clarification."

24:27.065 --> 24:28.834
What does that mean?

24:28.900 --> 24:30.168
Oh, my God.

24:28.900 --> 24:30.168
Jesus.

24:30.235 --> 24:31.703
Okay, you know what,
we pay for everything,

24:31.770 --> 24:33.104
we give her everything
she wants.

24:33.171 --> 24:35.540
Is that a nipple?

24:33.171 --> 24:35.540
That is a nipple, right?

24:35.607 --> 24:36.808
Why is it so close
to her armpit?

24:35.607 --> 24:36.808
I'm not sure.
