WEBVTT

00:17.951 --> 00:20.154
Welcome to Smigus-Dyngus!

00:20.188 --> 00:21.255
(laughs)

00:21.289 --> 00:22.390
It's my favorite Polish
family holiday.

00:22.423 --> 00:23.824
As you know,

00:23.857 --> 00:25.726
this is a bittersweet
Dyngus for me.

00:25.759 --> 00:27.828
Uh, it's my first one
without my mom or my pop.

00:27.861 --> 00:28.929
But I am happy

00:28.962 --> 00:30.231
to be reunited

00:30.264 --> 00:31.065
with Stosh,
Mmm.

00:31.099 --> 00:32.666
my kuzyn,

00:32.700 --> 00:34.868
and now I have two
wonderful new friends.

00:34.902 --> 00:37.105
So it is the dawn
of a new Dyngus.

00:37.138 --> 00:38.839
Let's get our
Dyngus on, people.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.874
Oh, uh, first a toast.

00:40.908 --> 00:42.743
Uh, as our Grandma Tekla

00:42.776 --> 00:44.178
used to say...

00:44.212 --> 00:46.747
(speaks Polish)

00:48.216 --> 00:50.784
(continues speaking Polish)

00:55.956 --> 00:59.727
(shouting in Polish)

00:59.760 --> 01:01.429
(Caryn and Zara gasp)

01:01.462 --> 01:03.197
Guys, stop.

01:03.231 --> 01:04.298
(shouting in Polish)

01:04.332 --> 01:06.134
(Caryn and Zara scream)

01:07.335 --> 01:09.270
And scene.
(laughs)

01:09.303 --> 01:10.738
(gasps)
What?!

01:10.771 --> 01:13.307
Welcome to our
reenactment

01:13.341 --> 01:15.976
of every Lewandoski
family gathering ever.

01:16.009 --> 01:18.579
(Polish polka music playing)

01:24.152 --> 01:27.155
(toasts in Polish)

01:30.624 --> 01:33.894
It's-it's a heavy wall.
She can't get out.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.796
(indistinct chatter)

01:36.830 --> 01:38.132
* He's leaving

01:38.166 --> 01:39.733
* Leaving *
(giggles)

01:39.767 --> 01:42.303
* On that midnight train
to Georgia *

01:42.336 --> 01:43.671
* Leaving on
that midnight train *

01:43.704 --> 01:46.607
* To Georgia *
* Hey...

01:46.640 --> 01:47.808
(imitates train whistle)

01:47.841 --> 01:49.009
* Let it all out

01:49.042 --> 01:50.244
* Shake, shout

01:50.278 --> 01:52.913
* Shake, shake, shake, shout

01:52.946 --> 01:55.516
* Turn up now
before you pop... *

01:59.453 --> 02:01.422
(singing in Polish)

02:01.455 --> 02:04.592
(singing nonsense)

02:04.625 --> 02:05.626
That's not Polish.

02:05.659 --> 02:08.128
It's Pole...ish.

02:08.162 --> 02:09.297
Look at us, guys.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.031
We're like
a family now.

02:11.064 --> 02:13.133
I mean, maybe someday
when we all have children,

02:13.167 --> 02:15.135
I can share my Dyngus
with them, too.

02:15.169 --> 02:17.938
Zara, can we borrow the
van for a couple hours?

02:17.971 --> 02:19.840
Sure thing, butch.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.175
(shouts)

02:21.209 --> 02:22.443
(loud crash)
Oh!

02:22.476 --> 02:23.511
Got 'em.

02:23.544 --> 02:25.979
Hmm.
Good-bye.

02:26.013 --> 02:27.348
And what's my Oscar
the Grouch puppet doing

02:27.381 --> 02:28.449
in this trash can?
Come on.

02:28.482 --> 02:29.817
* Night...
Let's get in the van.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.525
Uh-oh.

02:37.558 --> 02:40.394
Someone broke in and added
more stairs to our house.

02:40.428 --> 02:42.330
Hey, which one of us
should be the "drover"?

02:42.363 --> 02:45.366
The sober one should
be the "drover."

02:45.399 --> 02:47.235
Where are we heading?

02:47.268 --> 02:48.636
To see my son.

02:48.669 --> 02:49.570
Awesome.

02:49.603 --> 02:51.639
Let's do it.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.341
Wait, you have a son?

02:53.374 --> 02:54.342
Get in!

02:54.375 --> 02:56.076
(shouting)

02:56.109 --> 02:57.811
(laughing)

02:57.845 --> 03:00.180
Get up!

03:00.214 --> 03:01.415
What happened?

03:01.449 --> 03:03.351
(laughing):
You made me laugh.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.719
I pierogied my pants.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.989
(both sigh)

03:09.022 --> 03:10.424
I just can't
get over it.

03:10.458 --> 03:12.226
You have an actual son?

03:12.260 --> 03:15.195
Which means I have an actual
first cousin once-removed.

03:15.229 --> 03:16.997
Huh! Where does this end?

03:17.030 --> 03:18.266
Probably right there.

03:18.299 --> 03:19.867
Tell me all about him.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.769
Like, everything--
I want to know every detail.

03:21.802 --> 03:24.572
I knocked up a cocktail waitress
when I was 23.

03:24.605 --> 03:26.507
She had the kid but said
I couldn't see him

03:26.540 --> 03:28.609
because I was
an irresponsible douche bag.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.244
Which I was.

03:30.278 --> 03:32.246
And so I didn't.

03:32.280 --> 03:33.414
That's every detail.

03:33.447 --> 03:34.882
Wow.

03:36.384 --> 03:38.151
Tell it again.

03:39.453 --> 03:41.855
I knocked up a cocktail
waitress when I was 23.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.891
She had the kid but
said I couldn't see him

03:43.924 --> 03:45.526
because I was an
irresponsible douche bag.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.295
(laughs)
Love that part.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.431
So I always wanted a cat,
but it turned out

03:50.464 --> 03:51.799
that my father was
allergic to cats.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.467
So they got me a turtle instead.

03:53.501 --> 03:54.868
But then it turned out
that the turtle was allergic

03:54.902 --> 03:56.404
to my father, and it died.
Weird, right?

03:56.437 --> 03:57.905
Did you ever have a cat?

03:57.938 --> 04:01.041
I wanted one, but the
sultan forbade felines

04:01.074 --> 04:02.943
within the palace walls,

04:02.976 --> 04:05.346
so I had to play
with the slaves.

04:07.114 --> 04:09.116
I actually have no idea
if you're kidding.

04:09.149 --> 04:10.384
(chuckles)

04:10.418 --> 04:11.619
I am,

04:11.652 --> 04:14.422
but your story's still
weirder, nutcase.

04:14.455 --> 04:19.393
(laughs) Oh, I am so glad we
became Dyngus sisters tonight.

04:19.427 --> 04:20.628
Mmm.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.396
The Dyng bring us
together.

04:22.430 --> 04:23.397
(snorts)

04:23.431 --> 04:24.632
(laughs)

04:24.665 --> 04:27.134
Ow.
Ooh, "ow" can be our safeword.

04:27.167 --> 04:28.402
Ow.

04:28.436 --> 04:29.603
Yep.

04:32.205 --> 04:33.741
Wake up.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.175
Clear history!
Shh-shh-shh.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.777
This is his school.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.946
Oh, man.

04:40.180 --> 04:41.749
He's in there somewhere.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.150
Mm-hmm.

04:43.183 --> 04:44.184
You excited?

04:44.217 --> 04:45.353
Yeah, I am.

04:45.386 --> 04:46.954
(laughs)

04:46.987 --> 04:48.756
You know, the Dyngus party
really got me thinking.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.658
I got a son, Eric.

04:50.691 --> 04:53.527
He should know that his own
father cares about him, right?

04:53.561 --> 04:55.329
Well, definitely,
he should know.

04:55.363 --> 04:56.530
And he will know.

04:56.564 --> 04:57.531
Here, go give
him this 50.

04:57.565 --> 04:59.800
What, you don't want
to meet him?

04:59.833 --> 05:01.134
I told you-- I
can't, all right?

05:01.168 --> 05:02.336
Just go on,
give him the 50.

05:02.370 --> 05:03.437
Actually, you
know what?

05:03.471 --> 05:04.772
Make it a hundred.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.173
I only got one
kid, right?

05:06.206 --> 05:09.377
Actually, that
might not be right.

05:09.410 --> 05:11.545
How do I find him?
Like, what's he look like?

05:11.579 --> 05:13.447
I don't know.

05:13.481 --> 05:14.815
Cavelli-- last
name's Cavelli.

05:14.848 --> 05:17.050
I'll do the old
fake cough routine.

05:18.386 --> 05:20.354
(laughs)

05:22.390 --> 05:25.459
(coughing):
Cavelli? Cavelli?

05:25.493 --> 05:26.527
Damn it.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.396
It sounds like
I'm actually coughing.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.564
Does it?

05:32.032 --> 05:34.267
ERIC (coughing):
Cavelli.

05:37.871 --> 05:40.574
Oh, hey.

05:40.608 --> 05:42.209
Regina, hey,
how are you this morning?

05:42.242 --> 05:43.644
What the hell are
you doing here?

05:43.677 --> 05:45.379
Look, I'm not trying
to see the kid, all right?

05:45.413 --> 05:47.247
I'm just dropping off
an anonymous gift.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.982
Don't make a big stink
about it-- I've done it before.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.418
Uh, yeah, I
know, Stosh.

05:50.451 --> 05:51.819
And I know it's you
who throws a brick

05:51.852 --> 05:52.986
through our window
every Christmas.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.221
With a gift attached, yeah.

05:54.254 --> 05:55.723
(scoffs)
And a second brick

05:55.756 --> 05:57.558
with a receipt
in case he doesn't like it.

05:59.527 --> 06:00.561
(coughing):
Cavelli.
Can I help you?

06:00.594 --> 06:02.596
Indeed, you
can, Officer.

06:02.630 --> 06:05.566
I am looking for one
beautiful young boy

06:05.599 --> 06:09.503
who might want to go home
with a hundred dollars.

06:09.537 --> 06:11.004
Look, just knock it off with
the drive-by gifting, huh?

06:11.038 --> 06:12.873
It's stupid.
What else you want me to do?

06:12.906 --> 06:14.074
You won't let me see him.

06:14.107 --> 06:15.443
Oh, like you even
want to see him.

06:15.476 --> 06:16.410
I do want to see him.
Yeah, right.

06:16.444 --> 06:17.578
Yeah, right.
Okay, fine.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.447
Okay, fine. What?

06:19.480 --> 06:21.181
Take him, go ahead.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.617
Try to be an actual parent
for a couple of days.

06:23.651 --> 06:24.418
Meet me here at 3:00.

06:24.452 --> 06:25.886
ERIC:
Stosh!
3:00.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.455
Stosh, help me!
(Taser crackling)

06:32.059 --> 06:34.962
So, Frank.

06:34.995 --> 06:38.031
Sorry we haven't done this
sooner, but you know how it is.

06:38.065 --> 06:41.602
I've been busy, I'm sure
you've been slammed.

06:41.635 --> 06:45.405
The important thing
is... we're here now.

06:45.439 --> 06:49.109
You know, we got two whole days
to get to know each other.

06:50.277 --> 06:51.479
Wh-Why don't you
kick it off, huh?

06:51.512 --> 06:52.613
Tell me about yourself.

06:52.646 --> 06:53.814
You got any hobbies?

06:53.847 --> 06:56.584
Yeah, I'm
a frickin' ballerina.

06:56.617 --> 06:58.051
Okay, I'll kick it off.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.987
I'm in the dental
sales field.

07:00.020 --> 07:02.122
I was a sales rep for
a dental products firm

07:02.155 --> 07:03.657
called Sunny Smile.

07:03.691 --> 07:05.826
We sold, uh, non-acrylic
teeth-whitening products

07:05.859 --> 07:07.728
to dentists and
commercial retailers.

07:07.761 --> 07:12.132
Currently, I'm exploring
opportunities in other fields.

07:12.165 --> 07:15.803
Wow, that was worth
the 12-year wait.

07:15.836 --> 07:18.271
Okay.

07:18.305 --> 07:22.943
Okay, I think we need to address
the elephant in the room.

07:22.976 --> 07:25.112
You're angry with me.

07:25.145 --> 07:28.516
I'm your father, and I wasn't
a part of your life.

07:30.317 --> 07:31.619
I left you high and dry.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.821
And you probably see
other kids out there

07:33.854 --> 07:35.255
playing with
their dads,

07:35.288 --> 07:38.158
you know, maybe playing
a game of catch

07:38.191 --> 07:40.994
or getting an ice cream cone.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.832
And it hurts like a bitch,
doesn't it?

07:44.865 --> 07:46.634
I know. Believe me,

07:46.667 --> 07:48.869
I get it.

07:51.071 --> 07:53.607
I get it.

07:53.641 --> 07:56.376
(sighs)

08:00.313 --> 08:02.550
So, we good?

08:03.984 --> 08:05.352
(door opens)

08:05.385 --> 08:07.287
CARYN:
Hey.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.289
I am so glad you're home.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.291
I pierogied, and I can't get up.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.694
I... got you something.

08:13.727 --> 08:15.796
What is it?
It's a card.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.197
A greeting card.

08:17.230 --> 08:18.666
Here, let me.

08:18.699 --> 08:20.333
I mean, I know
how they work,

08:20.367 --> 08:21.802
but what's
the occasion?

08:21.835 --> 08:23.571
Nothing, really.

08:23.604 --> 08:27.575
I just had a few thoughts on you
and me and our friendship.

08:27.608 --> 08:28.508
Oh.
Here.

08:28.542 --> 08:30.010
Oh.
You can read it.

08:31.745 --> 08:33.747
Holy crap.

08:33.781 --> 08:37.017
I had taken an Adderall,
but it is all from the heart.

08:37.050 --> 08:38.351
Wow.

08:38.385 --> 08:41.221
Caryn, do you mind
if I read this later

08:41.254 --> 08:43.190
so that I can really...

08:43.223 --> 08:45.025
not read it right now?

08:45.058 --> 08:46.193
Oh, yeah, totally,
absolutely.

08:46.226 --> 08:47.460
Great.

08:49.462 --> 08:51.364
So can I just tell you
what it says?

08:51.398 --> 08:52.733
Yeah.
Okay.

08:52.766 --> 08:54.334
Here's the thing--

08:54.367 --> 08:56.570
I have always had terrible luck
with friendships.

08:56.604 --> 08:59.607
A lot of my female friends
have either gotten married

08:59.640 --> 09:01.775
or hated me.

09:01.809 --> 09:03.243
Terrible luck.

09:03.276 --> 09:05.613
And last night,
when we were on the stairs,

09:05.646 --> 09:08.448
I just felt like
we had a real connection.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.018
We did, right?
Yeah.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.453
Fourth stair club...!
Oh...

09:13.821 --> 09:14.922
Oh.

09:14.955 --> 09:16.857
So, anyway,
here's the thing.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.627
I just wanted to tell you
that I'm really happy

09:19.660 --> 09:22.796
you're in my life,
and last night was a lot of fun,

09:22.830 --> 09:24.932
and I can't wait
to do it again soon.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.366
Yeah, me, too.
When?

09:26.399 --> 09:28.068
When what?
When can we do
it again?

09:28.101 --> 09:30.470
Um...
Because I was
thinking, tonight,

09:30.503 --> 09:33.440
you and me can hang out
and I can make tacos.

09:33.473 --> 09:35.609
I just got a coupon
for shells.

09:35.643 --> 09:37.144
That sounds great.

09:37.177 --> 09:38.779
Great, okay.
I'm gonna go shopping.

09:38.812 --> 09:41.148
I have such a good feeling
about our friendship.

09:41.181 --> 09:42.816
Just don't go
getting married on me.

09:42.850 --> 09:44.451
Okay.

09:44.484 --> 09:45.653
Seriously, don't.

09:45.686 --> 09:46.654
Okay.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.588
Okay.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.665
Hey, is your mom still dancing

09:57.698 --> 09:59.066
down at the...?

09:59.099 --> 10:00.467
Never mind.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.235
Here we go.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.837
Found some items
in the basement a young fellow

10:03.871 --> 10:05.272
like you might find
entertaining.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.308
We got Trouble.

10:09.677 --> 10:11.278
The game, that is.

10:11.311 --> 10:12.680
(laughs)

10:12.713 --> 10:13.914
Ah, you know what?

10:13.947 --> 10:16.249
I think the Pop-O-Matic
bubble's gone.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.919
I used it in a lung transplant
when I was playing Operation.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.520
He didn't make it.

10:20.553 --> 10:21.855
Ooh!

10:21.889 --> 10:23.691
Movies.

10:23.724 --> 10:26.493
Bambi-- hmm,
sad and scary but good.

10:26.526 --> 10:27.828
Thumbelina--

10:27.861 --> 10:29.863
oh, off the charts, scary-wise.

10:29.897 --> 10:31.198
Memphis Belle,
Godfather...

10:31.231 --> 10:32.700
You know what?
Let's do The Godfather.

10:32.733 --> 10:33.767
Have you seen The Godfather?

10:33.801 --> 10:35.302
No.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.838
Where's it rank scary-wise,
compared to Thumbelina?

10:37.871 --> 10:39.472
Not even close.

10:39.506 --> 10:42.009
CARLO (over TV):
We lost enough money
last week on the game.

10:42.042 --> 10:44.111
(children shout, tires screech)

10:44.144 --> 10:46.947
Carlo, come here, come here,
come here, come here.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.983
(crowd clamoring)

10:56.690 --> 10:59.727
So, what do you think?

10:59.760 --> 11:01.661
If I could go back in time,

11:01.695 --> 11:03.731
I would re-enter
my mother's womb,

11:03.764 --> 11:05.899
pop out again,
spend every second

11:05.933 --> 11:07.735
of my life watching
this movie.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.169
I respect that choice.

11:09.202 --> 11:11.872
I take it back.

11:11.905 --> 11:14.141
I don't want
to watch the movie.

11:14.174 --> 11:15.876
I want to live in it.

11:15.909 --> 11:18.545
I want to be
Sonny Corleone.

11:18.578 --> 11:20.748
There's a scene coming up that
might make you change your mind.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.149
ERIC:
Stosh?

11:22.182 --> 11:23.751
I really think this is
a little too scary

11:23.784 --> 11:25.719
for Frank to be watching.

11:27.855 --> 11:31.224
You touch my sister again,
I'll kill you.

11:34.227 --> 11:35.362
Oh, my God!

11:35.395 --> 11:36.563
Again?

11:36.596 --> 11:38.031
Crank her up!

11:39.967 --> 11:41.534
Oh, God.

11:47.975 --> 11:50.243
*

12:18.005 --> 12:19.739
(gasping)

12:21.674 --> 12:22.976
CARYN:
Hi!

12:23.010 --> 12:24.411
I have

12:24.444 --> 12:27.948
such a big surprise for you!

12:27.981 --> 12:29.883
Something's happening.

12:29.917 --> 12:31.651
Remember how yesterday on
the stairs we were talking about

12:31.684 --> 12:34.321
how we both always wanted cats
when we were growing up?

12:34.354 --> 12:36.456
Well... ta-da!

12:36.489 --> 12:38.158
Outside the grocery store
was this

12:38.191 --> 12:39.592
pet adoption thing,
which was kismet,

12:39.626 --> 12:41.761
so I got us a cat
and named it...

12:41.795 --> 12:43.130
Kismet!

12:43.163 --> 12:44.664
Kismet,

12:44.697 --> 12:45.933
meet Zara.

12:45.966 --> 12:48.435
Now, the guy said
to let him out very slowly

12:48.468 --> 12:50.570
and let him sniff out
his environment.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.639
Yeah. Oh! Oh! Wait! No!

12:52.672 --> 12:54.607
Ooh.

12:54.641 --> 12:57.244
I guess Kismet
wasn't meant to be.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.279
(man speaking Italian)

13:04.517 --> 13:06.920
Hey, Luca Brasi's
about to get whacked.

13:06.954 --> 13:08.889
You're gonna miss it.

13:17.397 --> 13:18.999
All right.
You know what?

13:19.032 --> 13:20.700
I think it's time
we called it a night.

13:20.733 --> 13:21.701
No, no. Not yet.

13:21.734 --> 13:22.970
I want to see Apollonia get

13:23.003 --> 13:24.204
blown to bits one more time.

13:24.237 --> 13:26.006
You said that three
car bombs ago.

13:26.039 --> 13:27.040
Now, come on.
Don't work me.

13:27.074 --> 13:28.108
You got school tomorrow.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.210
Lay down.

13:30.243 --> 13:32.179
School bites.

13:32.212 --> 13:34.514
Can you take me to
Kiddie World instead?

13:34.547 --> 13:37.017
The strip club? It's fully nude.
There's no booze.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.719
Not Kitty World.
Kiddie World.

13:39.752 --> 13:41.821
It's an amusement park.

13:41.855 --> 13:42.890
Why the hell would
you want to go there?

13:42.923 --> 13:44.324
I'm 12, you ass.

13:44.357 --> 13:47.094
Okay. I'll take you
to Kiddie World.

13:48.761 --> 13:51.031
All right, now, come on.

13:51.064 --> 13:53.000
Try to get some sleep, huh?

13:53.033 --> 13:54.902
Good night, kid.
Good night, Dad.

14:02.943 --> 14:04.344
How long you been
standing there?

14:04.377 --> 14:05.345
Long enough

14:05.378 --> 14:06.713
to hear a boy and his father

14:06.746 --> 14:08.715
have a very special moment.

14:08.748 --> 14:09.749
He called you Dad.

14:09.782 --> 14:10.750
No, no. No, no, no.

14:10.783 --> 14:12.685
He called me dude.

14:12.719 --> 14:14.721
It's like all my Dyngus dreams
are coming true.

14:14.754 --> 14:16.756
All right, you know what?
Now you're bugging me.

14:16.789 --> 14:18.091
I'm gonna get some fresh air.

14:18.125 --> 14:20.393
Next year, we're gonna have
a huge Dyngus.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.108
Why are you sitting in there?

14:35.142 --> 14:36.543
It's Taco Tuesday.

14:36.576 --> 14:37.877
Oh, yeah?

14:37.911 --> 14:40.013
Am I very early or very late?

14:40.047 --> 14:42.082
You don't know what's
going on in that house.

14:42.115 --> 14:44.117
There's a Jewish woman
cooking Mexican food,

14:44.151 --> 14:46.086
singing "Mambo Italiano."

14:46.119 --> 14:47.354
I had to run away.

14:47.387 --> 14:48.888
I hear you.

14:48.922 --> 14:50.958
I got two people up there
acting like we're family

14:50.991 --> 14:52.892
just 'cause we're related
to each other.

14:52.926 --> 14:54.561
(groans)
What is with people?

14:54.594 --> 14:56.196
You share one nice
moment with them,

14:56.229 --> 14:58.031
and then suddenly
they want to have

14:58.065 --> 15:00.767
more nice moments,
like, all the time.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.535
It's a sickness.
Yes.

15:02.569 --> 15:03.971
Thank you.
It is a sickness.

15:04.004 --> 15:05.705
And it's a trap.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.207
'Cause if you have
more nice moments with them,

15:07.240 --> 15:08.942
eventually they'll figure out
what a worthless

15:08.976 --> 15:11.979
piece of crap you are,
and then what do you got, right?

15:12.012 --> 15:13.746
Emotional commitment
to other human beings.

15:13.780 --> 15:15.215
(groans)

15:15.248 --> 15:17.384
My number one pet peeve.

15:17.417 --> 15:18.818
Well, that and
Capri pants.

15:18.851 --> 15:20.153
Really?

15:20.187 --> 15:22.722
I think they're
a breezy summer look.

15:22.755 --> 15:23.957
You would.

15:23.991 --> 15:25.425
(cell phone chiming)

15:25.458 --> 15:28.028
Caryn video-calling me.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.965
Guess I got to do
what I got to do.

15:31.999 --> 15:33.133
Hi!

15:33.166 --> 15:34.001
Hi! Whoa!

15:34.034 --> 15:35.935
Where are you?

15:35.969 --> 15:37.637
Craziest thing!
I went to visit

15:37.670 --> 15:40.307
a friend of mine on his boat,
and we were out on the river,

15:40.340 --> 15:42.142
and then the fog rolled in.

15:42.175 --> 15:44.844
Now we're 20 klicks off course
and the river patrol...

15:44.877 --> 15:47.147
Oh, my God!
He's calling a code 12!

15:47.180 --> 15:48.415
What?! Oh, my goodness!

15:48.448 --> 15:50.183
Well, the most important thing

15:50.217 --> 15:52.019
is that you stay safe.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.620
Yeah.

15:53.653 --> 15:55.622
And that you make it back
for Taco Tuesday.

15:55.655 --> 15:58.025
(imitates foghorn)

15:58.058 --> 15:59.526
Oh! The wind's picking up.

15:59.559 --> 16:01.094
Lower the mizzen mast!

16:01.128 --> 16:04.097
Oh, shoot. I got to go
lower the mizzen mast.

16:04.131 --> 16:05.999
Bye.

16:06.033 --> 16:07.600
Iceberg right ahead!

16:07.634 --> 16:09.136
I hung up.
Oh.

16:13.173 --> 16:14.641
Okay! Anyone who's excited to go

16:14.674 --> 16:16.143
to go to Kiddie Land
with their dad today,

16:16.176 --> 16:17.977
raise his hand.
(whoops)

16:18.011 --> 16:19.912
Who are you?

16:20.513 --> 16:21.881
Oh, yeah.

16:21.914 --> 16:23.650
(ringtone playing)

16:23.683 --> 16:25.218
Oh, it's Stosh.

16:25.252 --> 16:26.986
I thought he was
down here with you.

16:28.255 --> 16:30.157
Hey!

16:30.190 --> 16:32.192
Aw, hey, Frank.
Damnedest thing.

16:32.225 --> 16:33.993
I got a phone call
late last night

16:34.027 --> 16:36.663
to come down here to Philly
for a job interview.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.898
I would've told you,
but I didn't want to wake you.

16:38.931 --> 16:40.467
I won't be home
till late tonight

16:40.500 --> 16:42.035
after your mom picks you up.

16:42.069 --> 16:43.836
But I bet there's someone there

16:43.870 --> 16:46.239
who would love to take you
to Kiddie World!

16:46.273 --> 16:49.042
First cousin once removed
Eric Lewandoski at your service.

16:49.076 --> 16:50.243
Sure.

16:50.277 --> 16:51.511
All right, have fun.

16:51.544 --> 16:53.746
See you when I see you.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.926
ERIC: So this is
what I was thinking.

17:06.959 --> 17:09.096
Before we get on any rides,
we grab a couple churros,

17:09.129 --> 17:12.399
and we take the Kiddie World
Choo-Choo around the park.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.867
You know, just to get
the lay of the land.

17:14.901 --> 17:17.670
You think my dad was lying
about that job interview?

17:17.704 --> 17:20.440
You know, to avoid
hanging out with me?

17:20.473 --> 17:23.042
What? No!
No, he wouldn't do that.

17:23.076 --> 17:24.944
Anyway, after that
choo-choo,

17:24.977 --> 17:28.281
Alpine Thunder, Death Plunge,
Spinning Sisters,

17:28.315 --> 17:31.718
Goliath's Chariot
and then Satan's Revenge.

17:31.751 --> 17:33.320
Awesome!

17:34.554 --> 17:36.623
Awesome!

17:36.656 --> 17:38.491
Gonna be so awesome.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.129
(gasps)
Hey!

17:42.162 --> 17:43.630
You made it.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.298
Oh, yeah.

17:45.332 --> 17:47.934
Ooh, that was really scary.

17:47.967 --> 17:49.969
That boat experience...

17:50.002 --> 17:51.371
Do you think I'm an idiot?

17:51.404 --> 17:53.140
I called river patrol.

17:53.173 --> 17:54.874
There was no fog.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.110
You went on a boat with
all your friends without me.

17:57.144 --> 17:58.645
I love boats.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.280
I would've made tacos
for everyone. Your loss.

18:00.313 --> 18:03.583
Caryn...
I wasn't on a boat at all.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.552
I slept in my van.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.287
Right outside.
What?

18:07.320 --> 18:10.290
I didn't want to do
Taco Tuesday with you.

18:10.323 --> 18:11.724
Why not?

18:11.758 --> 18:13.326
Do you not like tacos?

18:13.360 --> 18:14.794
Do you not
like Tuesdays?

18:14.827 --> 18:17.130
Do you not like me?

18:17.164 --> 18:18.331
(stammers)

18:18.365 --> 18:20.133
Oh.

18:20.167 --> 18:22.135
Wow!

18:22.169 --> 18:23.903
Ouch!

18:23.936 --> 18:25.138
You know what?

18:25.172 --> 18:28.007
Maybe I should
just get my stuff and go.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.176
Fine. Go.

18:29.209 --> 18:32.145
I don't care. Go!

18:32.179 --> 18:34.214
Why are you still
standing there? Go!

18:36.649 --> 18:39.919
Are you actually gonna go?

18:39.952 --> 18:42.955
Sorry we had to leave
after only 20 minutes.

18:42.989 --> 18:44.191
Yeah, I've never seen
anyone freak out

18:44.224 --> 18:46.426
on the Kiddie World
Choo-Choo before.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.528
How bad was it?

18:48.561 --> 18:50.197
You puked on a baby.

18:50.230 --> 18:51.998
(laughs)
Well, he's young.

18:52.031 --> 18:54.501
He won't remember.

18:54.534 --> 18:57.270
Okay, seriously, you are
actually moving out?

18:57.304 --> 18:59.772
Yes. I said I'm moving out.
You said, "Fine. Go."

18:59.806 --> 19:01.941
I said it,
but I didn't mean it!

19:01.974 --> 19:04.611
That's just how Jews fight!
Zara?

19:04.644 --> 19:06.979
What is going on?
Why are you doing this?

19:07.013 --> 19:08.815
Because I don't want to
keep hurting your feelings!

19:08.848 --> 19:11.150
I cannot be the kind of friend
that you want me to be.

19:11.184 --> 19:13.220
I just want the friend
that I had

19:13.253 --> 19:14.721
on the stairs the other night.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.323
Well, I can't do it on command!

19:16.356 --> 19:17.824
I didn't command you.

19:17.857 --> 19:20.460
I just suggested
that we have Taco Tuesday.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.861
Tuesdays! Tuesdays!

19:21.894 --> 19:23.196
You had us eating tacos

19:23.230 --> 19:25.031
every Tuesday
until the sun burns out.

19:25.064 --> 19:26.366
This is mine.

19:26.399 --> 19:28.368
I just wanted
a nice scheduled event,

19:28.401 --> 19:30.370
because that's what friends do.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.071
That's what
community centers do.

19:32.104 --> 19:34.207
Real moments between
real human beings

19:34.241 --> 19:37.744
only happen organically
and spontaneously.

19:37.777 --> 19:39.045
Well, I disagree.

19:39.078 --> 19:40.413
But you know what? Fine.

19:40.447 --> 19:41.814
We've had our real moment,

19:41.848 --> 19:44.417
so now you can just run away
like that stupid cat.

19:44.451 --> 19:46.085
You probably terrified
him on the ride home.

19:46.118 --> 19:49.188
He was fleeing a lifetime
of Meow Chow Mondays.

19:49.222 --> 19:51.224
(laughs):
Oh, yeah.

19:51.258 --> 19:53.426
It was Frisky Feast Fridays!

19:53.460 --> 19:54.894
(door slams)

19:54.927 --> 19:57.264
Oh, I hear it now.

19:57.297 --> 20:00.199
I don't know. It's been
a tough week, you know?

20:00.233 --> 20:02.269
I ain't betting
the Yankees anymore.

20:02.302 --> 20:03.370
What the hell?!

20:03.403 --> 20:05.204
Son of a bitch was lying!

20:05.238 --> 20:07.240
I knew it! Pull over!

20:07.274 --> 20:09.309
(tires screech)

20:10.477 --> 20:12.712
Hey...
Come here!

20:12.745 --> 20:14.247
Hey, kid, take it easy.

20:14.281 --> 20:14.914
Come here! Come here!
Would you take it easy?

20:14.947 --> 20:17.250
Aah! God, kid!

20:17.284 --> 20:19.352
Hey! Come on!

20:19.386 --> 20:21.321
Whoa! Whoa! Aah!

20:24.891 --> 20:27.294
(grunting)

20:27.327 --> 20:29.729
Um, who's that kid
beating the crap out of Stosh?

20:29.762 --> 20:31.130
His son.

20:31.163 --> 20:32.231
Oh.

20:32.265 --> 20:34.367
ERIC:
Poor Stosh.

20:34.401 --> 20:35.468
He's one of those
people that are

20:35.502 --> 20:37.537
terrified of
emotional commitment.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.038
They run away at the first
feeling of closeness,

20:39.071 --> 20:40.239
and they wind up hurting

20:40.273 --> 20:42.442
the people that need
them the most.

20:42.475 --> 20:45.312
Anyhooski, what's
going on with you?

20:47.480 --> 20:49.816
Um, is that how
I made you feel?

20:49.849 --> 20:51.551
(screaming)

20:51.584 --> 20:53.119
Kind of.

20:53.152 --> 20:55.121
I'm sorry.

20:55.154 --> 20:56.756
Oh, I'm sorry, too!

20:56.789 --> 20:59.091
(grunting)

21:02.094 --> 21:03.663
If you ever lie

21:03.696 --> 21:07.166
about not being able to take me
to Kiddie World again,

21:07.199 --> 21:09.336
I'll kill you.

21:09.369 --> 21:10.570
Okay, so we're good, right?

21:10.603 --> 21:12.972
We're good... Dad.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.310
(groans)

21:17.344 --> 21:19.412
That's my boy!

21:19.446 --> 21:22.214
Oh, thank God
we didn't watch Scarface.

21:25.184 --> 21:26.853
ERIC:
You all right?

21:26.886 --> 21:29.088
You know,
you don't look that bad.
Thanks.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.924
Yeah, I got this and, um,
a couple of broken ribs

21:31.958 --> 21:34.126
from Thunderfoot over there.

21:34.160 --> 21:35.362
ZARA: Getting beat up's
a good look for you.

21:35.395 --> 21:36.696
Nice work, Frank.

21:36.729 --> 21:38.931
So, Frank,

21:38.965 --> 21:41.334
how are you enjoying school?

21:41.368 --> 21:42.702
I told you.

21:42.735 --> 21:45.505
Don't ever ask me
about my business.

21:45.538 --> 21:47.474
He never told me that.

21:47.507 --> 21:49.509
I just met him.

21:49.542 --> 21:52.111
Frank, where'd
that cat come from?

21:52.144 --> 21:53.513
Good night.

21:53.546 --> 21:55.314
Hmm.

21:55.348 --> 21:57.584
