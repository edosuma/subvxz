JANE: This is the glamorous
world of fashion.

00:11.579 --> 00:15.316
A place where
making it to the top
is nearly impossible.

00:17.418 --> 00:21.555
And this is me.
Jane Quimby.

00:21.589 --> 00:23.591
Career girl in high fashion,

00:23.624 --> 00:26.127

Wait?

00:39.573 --> 00:41.342
For what?

00:41.375 --> 00:42.476
Oh, I don't know.

00:42.510 --> 00:44.245
For the humiliation
to fade?

00:45.246 --> 00:46.514
Just a little?

00:47.248 --> 00:48.416
Okay.

to step your game up, man.

(MOCKINGLY)
Oh, yeah...

01:25.286 --> 01:27.521
He's beautiful, okay?

01:27.555 --> 01:29.290
You can't blame me
for looking.

01:29.323 --> 01:30.624
Whatever.

01:30.658 --> 01:34.195
Maybe I'd be
less invisible if
I tried out for cheerleading?

01:34.228 --> 01:35.263
Hmm.

01:35.296 --> 01:37.531
I'm just thinking
out loud here.

01:37.565 --> 01:41.602
The guy hasn't made
eye contact with me
since the seventh grade.

01:41.635 --> 01:44.438
Yeah, well,
I warned you not to
let him touch your boobs.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.140

02:00.454 --> 02:04.625
Now, we're gonna review
Cervantes' Don Quixote,
chapter two.

Psst. Plain Jane.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.163
Yes, Lulu?

Where'd you get that outfit?

02:10.431 --> 02:11.665

02:16.604 --> 02:18.639
Don't you ever wonder
what it would be like?

02:18.672 --> 02:21.342
Of course. I'm a guy.
Studies show
we think about it, like,

02:21.375 --> 02:23.177
every seven seconds
or something.

02:23.211 --> 02:25.746
No. I didn't mean...
Ew. I'm not talking
about that.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.616
I mean them.

02:28.649 --> 02:32.620
It all looks so,
I don't know,
easy for them.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.188
They look like tools.

02:35.323 --> 02:36.424
I think they look...

02:36.690 --> 02:38.692
Happy.

02:38.726 --> 02:41.395
I'm happy, all right?

02:41.429 --> 02:43.697
Of course you're happy.
You have me as a best friend.

02:43.731 --> 02:45.533

possibly want?

Hey, Ben.

What's that?

03:04.252 --> 03:05.686
What's on it?

03:05.719 --> 03:08.622
Not entirely sure.
Various plant life, I think.

03:08.656 --> 03:11.259
It's a vegetarian pizza.

I ordered and you said,

03:14.762 --> 03:16.664
"Why would something
like this ever exist?"

03:16.697 --> 03:19.433
I've decided
to try new things.

03:19.467 --> 03:21.702
Is one of those
new things a job?

03:21.735 --> 03:22.736
How was your interview?

03:22.770 --> 03:25.639
Not great.
Wasn't a good match.

Okay?

Can't wait for that.

It's a good one.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.382
Mmm.

04:08.416 --> 04:10.751
All right, no!
Why would something
like this ever exist?

04:37.578 --> 04:39.146
But it's perfect.

04:39.179 --> 04:42.850
I don't know, Jane.
You'd have to sign up for
the career internship program,

04:42.883 --> 04:45.319
which means leaving
the school at 11:30
every day,

04:45.353 --> 04:47.455
which I'm sure
has a silver lining,

04:47.488 --> 04:49.323
but look,
you'd be sacrificing

04:49.357 --> 04:51.559
a huge part of your
high school experience.

04:51.592 --> 04:53.627
I get it. I do.

04:53.661 --> 04:55.496
But, you know,
it's not like

04:55.529 --> 04:57.865
I'm at the center of
the social universe
around here as it is.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.867
Is this about your brother?
If it's a money thing...

04:59.900 --> 05:04.104
No. Yeah.

05:04.137 --> 05:07.508
I mean, you know,
I could help out,
which is good.

05:07.541 --> 05:10.110
Ben's been
carrying everything
since our dad died.

05:10.143 --> 05:13.347
I mean, he had
to leave college just
to take care of me.

05:13.381 --> 05:15.749
What about your mom?
Maybe she could help out.

05:15.783 --> 05:17.551
Well...
You know, I mean...

05:17.585 --> 05:19.387
If you can find her,
let me know.

05:20.588 --> 05:23.357
Look, I want to
take care of Ben. I do.

05:23.391 --> 05:25.759
But this is about
my future, too.

Not if you need a full ride.

05:28.429 --> 05:29.663

It could be
my ticket to Parsons.

can't believe
she said yes.

the internship first.

drive into the city.

Are you kidding?

06:01.629 --> 06:04.665

into the city.

to be incredible.

around here are saying.

11:19.479 --> 11:20.881

11:21.849 --> 11:23.150
Oh! Right.

to kill the fabric
pendants for spring?

11:33.794 --> 11:35.763
Yeah. Yeah, I did. Yeah.

11:35.796 --> 11:36.663
Why would
you do that?

11:36.696 --> 11:38.165
I mean, they were
ruining the jacket.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.734
It was completely wrong.
Had to be done.

11:40.768 --> 11:42.002
Without talking
to me first?

11:42.035 --> 11:45.172
Oh, I'm sorry.
Really, I am.

11:45.205 --> 11:50.010
But the jacket looks
so much better without it.

11:50.978 --> 11:52.212

You seem really nice. Jane.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.320
But Gray... I mean,

12:33.353 --> 12:36.556
she didn't get to the top
without crushing
a few souls on the way up.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.859
I spent four hours
talking her last
sobbing assistant

12:38.892 --> 12:40.327
out of a bathroom stall.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.229
My advice?
Don't take it personally.

12:43.964 --> 12:45.799
I'll see yOkay.ter, okay?

12:45.833 --> 12:47.234
I've got to work
through lunch. Again.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.911
Oh, yeah, it's...

12:59.379 --> 13:00.881
Gross.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.349
What?

13:02.382 --> 13:06.153
Does that actually
work for you?

13:06.186 --> 13:08.088
Most of the time.
Yeah.

13:08.121 --> 13:11.091
Really? That's...
Wow, shocking.

13:11.124 --> 13:14.862
It's the accent.
Pretty much say anything
and get away with it.

13:14.895 --> 13:18.966
(CHUCKLES) Well,
at least you can
admit it.

13:18.999 --> 13:21.101
You know, I haven't
seen you around before.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.903
That's because
it's my first day.

13:22.936 --> 13:24.237
Oh, Jeremy Jones.

13:24.271 --> 13:25.338
Jane Quimby.

13:27.941 --> 13:29.943
Well, back to work.

13:29.977 --> 13:32.579
You should come by
sometime. I'm in design.

13:32.612 --> 13:33.981
I'm always around,
working late,

13:34.014 --> 13:35.983
so I can give you
some advice

13:36.016 --> 13:37.017
on being the new kid.

13:37.050 --> 13:38.886
Right.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.020
Nice to meet you, Jane.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.137
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

13:57.170 --> 13:59.306
Hey. Just wanted
to get you started
on some paperwork.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.874
Photo identification,
home address,

14:00.908 --> 14:02.910
W-2, I-9,
bank account information.

14:02.943 --> 14:05.979
Oh! We have a really great
retirement plan.

14:06.013 --> 14:07.014
Are you okay?

14:07.915 --> 14:09.649
Yeah. I just...

14:09.682 --> 14:13.887
Um, I'll need to bring
this stuff in on Monday
if that's okay?

14:13.921 --> 14:15.388
Sure. But Monday
at the latest.

14:15.422 --> 14:17.891
'Cause I can't get you
started working until
I have all the paperwork.

14:17.925 --> 14:19.259
You know,

14:19.292 --> 14:21.194
Right. Of course.

14:21.228 --> 14:22.329
Okay, thanks.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.952
Hello? Yeah,
hold on a second.

Uh, Ben?

14:47.487 --> 14:48.922
Ben?

14:50.290 --> 14:52.325
He's not available.
Can I take a message?

14:55.362 --> 14:59.032
Look, I know
we're a little late
on the payments, but...

15:00.433 --> 15:02.369
Wait. How many behind are we?

15:03.971 --> 15:05.105
That many?

15:11.478 --> 15:15.382
I'll take over the payments.
Yeah, we'll be caught up in...

15:15.415 --> 15:18.986
Three months.
That's all I need.

15:19.019 --> 15:23.156
No, I'm not his wife.
I'm his sister.

BILLY: You'll never
get away with it.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.093
Not without you, I won't.

15:26.126 --> 15:28.028
You're the only one
that can help.

15:28.061 --> 15:31.364
Help you forge
illegal documents?
That's, like, a felony.

15:31.398 --> 15:34.367
Don't be so dramatic.
I mean, you made all of
your brother's fake IDs.

15:34.401 --> 15:37.737
Yeah, he was
going to dive bars,
not taking someone's job.

15:37.770 --> 15:42.042
I understand the risk, Billy.
But I have to do something.

15:42.075 --> 15:45.012
They're going
to take our house.

15:46.513 --> 15:48.248
No, don't, don't cry.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.283
You know
I don't like it
when the ladies cry.

15:52.152 --> 15:53.953
So, you'll help me?

15:56.089 --> 16:00.027
You don't have to do this.
Ben, he wouldn't
want you to do this.

16:00.060 --> 16:05.198
Ben won't know.
And it's not just for him.

16:06.133 --> 16:07.367
I need this, Billy.

16:12.105 --> 16:13.340
Fine. IYes!do it.

Now what?

I don't know.

16:52.279 --> 16:53.413
Just go get a drink
or something,
I'll be right back.

to the bathroom. Relax.

how you been, Janey?

17:16.169 --> 17:18.405
Good, good.

You know how it is.

looking at? (CHUCKLES)

18:06.553 --> 18:10.623
I can come to a party
if I want, Lulu.
You can't stop me.

18:10.657 --> 18:13.626
All right?
And you need to stop
being mean to Jane. Okay?

anything to you,

You've forbidden me
from telling a soul.

speak at school.

18:54.201 --> 18:58.705
I don't know.
I just do.

18:59.672 --> 19:01.441

I gotta be honest,
it's a little strange
walking these halls again.

Maybe you'd remember me
by the nickname you gave me
back in the day.

25:31.598 --> 25:33.833
Shaw the Jaw?

25:33.866 --> 25:36.636
Come on.
Giant headgear?
20 extra pounds?

25:36.669 --> 25:38.004
Ring a bell?

25:38.037 --> 25:41.641
Yeah. I'm pretty sure
I never would've called
you Shaw the Jaw.

25:41.674 --> 25:43.976
Well, you did.
Maybe you've just
matured since high school.

25:44.010 --> 25:45.712
No, I mean,
I would've come up with

25:45.745 --> 25:47.046
something way better
than that.

25:47.079 --> 25:48.080
Well, you didn't.

25:50.617 --> 25:54.987
Sorry.
Really, I'm sorry.

25:55.021 --> 25:56.856
You know how
teenage boys can be.

25:56.889 --> 26:02.028
Yes. Yes, I do.
I actually wanted to discuss
Jane and her internship.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.863
What internship?

26:03.896 --> 26:05.665
The one you
authorized her to take

26:05.698 --> 26:07.033
by signing this
permission form.

26:12.071 --> 26:15.908
Wow. She does a better
Ben Quimby than I do.

26:15.942 --> 26:17.744
How'd she get the "B"
to loop like that?

26:17.777 --> 26:20.079
I'm gonna pretend
I didn't hear that.

26:20.112 --> 26:21.948
Look, I just
want to make sure

26:21.981 --> 26:24.183
Jane is doing
the internship for
all the right reasons.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.788
Of course.
I'll talk to her.

26:29.722 --> 26:31.090
She's my kid sister.

26:31.123 --> 26:33.893
Last thing I want
in the world is for
Janey to grow up too fast.

26:38.865 --> 26:42.101
I've been seeing him
for a year. Married.

26:42.134 --> 26:43.035
Totally
married.

26:43.069 --> 26:45.037
I know it's a total
disaster in waiting.

26:45.071 --> 26:47.940
But there's just
something about him.

26:47.974 --> 26:50.677
I mean, the man
really knows
how to make a girl...

26:50.710 --> 26:51.978
You know?

26:52.011 --> 26:54.046
Yeah, can't say
that I do.

26:54.080 --> 26:55.114
You know what
I mean, right, Jane?

26:56.683 --> 26:58.818
Yeah. Totally.

26:59.786 --> 27:01.854
I do know that thing.

27:03.790 --> 27:05.758
JEREMY: CUh...steal you?

27:05.792 --> 27:06.793
For a bit?

27:07.794 --> 27:08.795
(MOUTHING)

27:15.067 --> 27:17.036
Okay, that's what
I'm saying.

27:17.069 --> 27:18.104
Get it, girl.

27:18.137 --> 27:19.839
See Jane run.

27:19.872 --> 27:22.074
(CHUCKLES)
It's a matter of pride.

27:22.108 --> 27:23.042
It's soccer.

27:23.075 --> 27:25.077
No, it's not.
It's football!

27:25.111 --> 27:27.413
And this country
can't just go and make up
its own name for it.

27:27.446 --> 27:29.081
It's a disgrace.

27:29.115 --> 27:30.983
No, it's America.

27:32.985 --> 27:35.121
You have pretty eyes.

27:35.154 --> 27:37.223
You totally need
new material.

27:38.224 --> 27:40.226
I'm deadly serious,
Jane Quimby.

27:40.259 --> 27:42.929
You have very,
very pretty eyes.

27:42.962 --> 27:46.165
And you, Jeremy Jones,
have a very,

27:46.198 --> 27:48.835
very bad reputation.

27:49.168 --> 27:51.137
Me? A reputation?

27:53.005 --> 27:54.741
Well, I think that's
completely unwarranted.

27:54.774 --> 27:56.175
Oh, really?

27:56.208 --> 27:59.078
Okay, maybe a little
bit warranted. But...

28:00.747 --> 28:02.114
I really like you, Jane.

28:05.017 --> 28:06.185
I should go.

28:06.218 --> 28:08.220
Don't.

28:08.254 --> 28:09.688
No, I should
definitely go.

28:12.058 --> 28:13.960
And...

28:13.993 --> 28:15.161
I like you, too.

28:28.307 --> 28:30.009
You're out late.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.043
Uh...

28:32.211 --> 28:34.947
Since when do you
wait up for me?

28:34.981 --> 28:37.216
Since when do you
tiptoe in late?

28:38.284 --> 28:39.285
I, uh...

28:40.920 --> 28:43.289
I was out studying.

28:43.322 --> 28:46.158
'Cause I have
midterms coming up,
so I was studying late...

28:46.192 --> 28:47.827
I talked to
Miss Shaw today

28:47.860 --> 28:49.161
about your
new internship.

28:49.195 --> 28:51.197
The one I gave
my permission for.

28:51.230 --> 28:53.065

28:53.099 --> 28:54.266
I'm sorry.

28:54.300 --> 28:55.201

just tell me?

28:56.969 --> 28:58.237
I don't know, I...

29:00.006 --> 29:03.009
I guess I didn't want you
to think that I was

29:03.042 --> 29:04.944
doing it because...

29:04.977 --> 29:06.278
I can't find a job?

29:08.280 --> 29:10.049
Is that why
you're doing this?

29:10.082 --> 29:12.184
No. It's not

29:13.219 --> 29:15.888
entirely about that.

29:18.190 --> 29:23.129
Look, Jane,
the real world isn't
going anywhere. It'll wait.

29:23.162 --> 29:25.865
You should be out there
enjoying high school,
like I did.

29:26.833 --> 29:28.034
Like you did?

29:28.067 --> 29:31.303
High school isn't
a four year party
for everyone, Ben.

29:31.337 --> 29:34.974
I know it's different for you.
But there's no reason
to try and escape it.

29:35.007 --> 29:39.245
I'm not. Look, this job,

29:39.278 --> 29:44.350
it's something
I've always dreamed about
and now it's here.

29:44.383 --> 29:46.218
I really want this, Ben.

29:50.356 --> 29:51.390
Then I'll support it.

29:53.259 --> 29:55.361
But I do have one
very serious question.

29:56.362 --> 29:59.866
When you sign my name,

29:59.899 --> 30:02.034
how do you get the "B"
to loop like that?

30:02.068 --> 30:05.972
Is it one continuous
or is it several
random strokes?

30:06.005 --> 30:07.239
It's the strokes.

30:07.273 --> 30:09.041
ItIt's the strokes.s.

30:09.075 --> 30:10.309
It's like three
random, little...

This is a very
important shipment, Jane.

to call and see
if they can bring it here?

31:15.007 --> 31:16.375
No. I do not.

whole thing up.

37:37.456 --> 37:39.591
I don't know what
you're referring to.

37:40.759 --> 37:43.795
But I do know
that eventually

37:43.829 --> 37:45.764
you're gonna have
to take sides, Jane.

37:48.867 --> 37:50.436
Make sure you pick
the right one.

37:55.374 --> 37:56.542
GRAY: You did what?

37:56.575 --> 37:58.544
JANE: I presented your idea.

37:58.577 --> 38:00.579
Or, at least,
what I think
was your idea.

38:00.612 --> 38:01.547
Why would you do that?

38:01.580 --> 38:04.550
Because you were right.
India made her move.

38:04.583 --> 38:06.518
She is after your job, Gray.

38:06.552 --> 38:08.587
The meeting change,
it was her.

38:08.620 --> 38:12.391
But your stuff,
the shipment,
it's brilliant. It's...

38:12.424 --> 38:13.525
(SPEAKS FRENCH)

38:14.726 --> 38:15.861
I'm halfway
around the world.

38:15.894 --> 38:17.563
How do you expect me
to fix this?

38:19.431 --> 38:20.432
But...

38:21.633 --> 38:22.868
I think Michael liked it.

38:22.901 --> 38:24.636
You think
or you know?

38:25.637 --> 38:27.773
Well, he...

38:27.806 --> 38:28.807
Forget it.

38:31.510 --> 38:32.511
(SIGHS)

38:46.792 --> 38:49.895
* Heaven is a great idea

38:49.928 --> 38:52.664
* When we need it
it's always near

38:52.698 --> 38:56.802
* But we're protecting God
in bulletproof cars

38:59.838 --> 39:03.509
* Living on the Earth
and my head's in the sky

39:03.542 --> 39:06.545
* Living on the Earth
and I don't know why

39:06.578 --> 39:10.949
* We take ourselves
so seriously

39:20.191 --> 39:21.927
* All right

39:21.960 --> 39:24.696
* All in my mind

39:33.939 --> 39:35.707
* All right

39:35.741 --> 39:39.745
* All in my mind

39:39.778 --> 39:43.482
* Oh, my God,
you're serious... *

39:43.515 --> 39:45.717
Hard day
at the office, dear?

39:45.751 --> 39:47.719
You have no idea.

39:48.954 --> 39:51.690
This week, Billy,

39:51.723 --> 39:56.962
it was the first time
I've ever felt like
I wasn't invisible.

39:58.497 --> 40:02.668
Like I could see
the other side, you know?

40:03.935 --> 40:05.737
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

40:08.740 --> 40:10.642
(SIGHING) Well,

40:10.676 --> 40:11.910
it was nice
while it lasted.

40:15.647 --> 40:16.782
Hello?

40:18.950 --> 40:20.686
Yes, I understand.

40:22.588 --> 40:23.922
No, I understand.

40:26.257 --> 40:27.726
Of course.

40:29.227 --> 40:30.962
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)

40:32.931 --> 40:34.666
Sorry, Janey.

40:36.668 --> 40:37.903
You okay?

40:38.737 --> 40:40.438
What did she say?

40:42.841 --> 40:44.042
"See you Monday."
