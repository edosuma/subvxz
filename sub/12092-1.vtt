05:14.375 --> 05:15.749
Hey.

05:18.083 --> 05:20.083
Do you remember my name?

05:21.916 --> 05:25.540
Romina.
I like to call you Ro.

05:28.749 --> 05:31.083
What are you doing now?
You got plans?

05:32.582 --> 05:34.083
I gotta go home.

05:34.749 --> 05:36.249
Want me to give you a ride?

06:13.415 --> 06:14.916
Thanks.

06:22.957 --> 06:25.083
You don't wanna
talk or anything?

06:26.415 --> 06:28.374
You know, I leave town
tomorrow after we pack up.

06:28.457 --> 06:30.916
I'm not gonna be
around for another year.

06:31.916 --> 06:33.540
Another year?

06:36.624 --> 06:40.291
Yeah, you wanna get
a beer or something?

06:44.290 --> 06:48.582
I got someone, so no.

06:52.415 --> 06:54.249
Just wanted to see you again.

06:54.916 --> 06:55.999
Thanks.

Hey.

07:56.582 --> 07:58.166
Is Romina here?

07:58.248 --> 08:00.290
No. Hold on.

08:05.248 --> 08:06.791
She's working.

08:06.874 --> 08:10.165
Okay. Do you remember me?

08:12.374 --> 08:13.999
Yes, I remember you.

08:16.499 --> 08:18.041
Who's that guy?

08:24.207 --> 08:25.666
He's yours.

08:29.041 --> 08:30.666
You wanna hold him?

08:42.916 --> 08:44.415
There you go.

08:59.415 --> 09:01.082
His name's Jason.

09:27.999 --> 09:29.999
Hey. There you go.

09:30.999 --> 09:32.332
Thanks.

09:32.415 --> 09:33.874
Good? Great.

09:37.415 --> 09:39.666
Hey.
What are you doing here?

09:40.207 --> 09:42.040
Anything you wanna tell me?

09:44.916 --> 09:48.374
Anything you think I might
wanna know before I leave here

09:50.082 --> 09:52.207
forever and I never come back?

09:53.082 --> 09:55.832
Let's go outside. Come on.

10:09.415 --> 10:11.332
You weren't gonna tell me?

10:12.749 --> 10:14.374
It was just a fling, right?

10:19.248 --> 10:21.332
That means you
don't gotta tell me?

10:24.082 --> 10:26.540
Just as, like,
a common courtesy or...

10:30.248 --> 10:31.499
There might even be
a law, you know,

10:31.582 --> 10:33.707
you gotta fucking
tell somebody.

10:34.165 --> 10:35.998
I haven't heard
from you in over a year.

10:37.749 --> 10:40.707
You just took off.
Never called me.

10:46.415 --> 10:49.374
I gotta leave in four hours.
I don't know what to do.

10:52.165 --> 10:54.248
You do whatever you need to do.

10:55.374 --> 10:57.082
What are you gonna do?

10:59.582 --> 11:01.499
I'm gonna do what I have to do.

11:01.582 --> 11:03.374
I'm going to school.

11:06.248 --> 11:08.415
I take care of Jason.
I work here.

11:09.415 --> 11:11.082
And I have a man.

11:12.415 --> 11:14.998
So that's what I'm doing.
That's my life.

11:15.915 --> 11:17.374
You're busy.

11:18.165 --> 11:20.749
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm real busy.

11:24.749 --> 11:26.207
Well...

11:28.832 --> 11:30.415
I don't wanna keep you.

11:31.499 --> 11:32.915
Okay.

11:33.374 --> 11:34.540
All right.

11:54.707 --> 11:57.624
<i>When does this pay
period end, Jack? On Friday?</i>

11:57.873 --> 11:59.248
Why?

11:59.374 --> 12:00.831
Because I gotta get paid.

12:00.915 --> 12:02.998
Just pay me for
half the week, all right?

12:03.082 --> 12:05.332
I don't give advances out.

12:05.415 --> 12:07.749
I'm not asking
for an advance, Jack.

12:08.831 --> 12:10.248
I'm quitting.

12:11.082 --> 12:13.165
You can't quit.
I just did.

12:31.082 --> 12:32.540
Hey.
Hey.

12:33.707 --> 12:36.831
Wow. You look
like a princess.

12:39.707 --> 12:41.582
What are you still doing here?

12:43.248 --> 12:45.082
I stuck around.

12:45.207 --> 12:46.406
This is really not a good time.

12:46.415 --> 12:47.831
No?
No.

12:47.915 --> 12:49.998
I was just gonna
take him to the park

12:50.082 --> 12:53.165
or maybe see if I could just sit
on the porch, just say hi to him.

12:53.248 --> 12:54.831
We're on our way to church.

12:54.915 --> 12:56.374
Going to church?

12:56.790 --> 12:58.207
Um...

12:59.499 --> 13:00.915
This is Kofi.

13:00.998 --> 13:02.582
- We need to go.
- Yeah.

13:03.748 --> 13:05.915
You should call. You can't
just show up, you know?

13:06.040 --> 13:07.873
- You ready?
- Yeah.

13:09.998 --> 13:11.165
Okay.

13:11.248 --> 13:12.748
- Hey.
- Hi.

13:16.415 --> 13:17.831
You live here?

13:17.915 --> 13:19.873
Yup. This is my house.

13:21.248 --> 13:22.915
How long you in town?

13:26.915 --> 13:28.332
I'm gonna stick around.

13:32.915 --> 13:34.374
What are you looking at?

13:35.499 --> 13:37.748
Really, you gonna
do this shit today?

13:39.248 --> 13:40.706
Do what?

13:53.040 --> 13:55.415
<i>Is it your will that
Jason should be baptized</i>

13:55.540 --> 13:56.915
<i>in the faith of the Church,</i>

13:57.040 --> 14:00.040
<i>- which we all have professed with you?
- Yes.</i>

14:00.582 --> 14:03.831
By God's gift, through
water and the Holy Spirit,

14:04.332 --> 14:07.248
we are reborn into
everlasting life.

14:07.374 --> 14:11.165
In His goodness, may He continue
to pour out His blessings

14:11.248 --> 14:13.207
upon these sons
and daughters of His.

14:13.581 --> 14:17.706
May He make them faithful
members of His holy people.

14:22.248 --> 14:25.248
Jason, I baptize you
in the name of the Father,

14:25.374 --> 14:28.706
and of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit.

14:30.165 --> 14:33.831
This child of yours has
been enlightened by Christ.

14:33.915 --> 14:36.873
He is to walk always
as a child of the light.

14:37.581 --> 14:40.831
God, the father of our Lord, Jesus
Christ, has freed you from sin.

14:40.915 --> 14:43.415
We now anoint you
with the Chrism of Salvation

14:43.499 --> 14:46.831
as Christ was anointed
priest, prophet and king.

14:46.915 --> 14:49.748
So may you always live
as a member of His body,

14:49.831 --> 14:52.581
sharing everlasting life.
Amen.

14:56.706 --> 15:00.665
In the name of this child and the
spirit of our common friendship,

15:00.748 --> 15:04.415
let us pray together in the
words our Lord has given us.

15:04.915 --> 15:09.332
Our Father who art
in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name.

15:09.581 --> 15:12.332
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done

15:12.748 --> 15:14.831
on Earth as it is in Heaven.

15:14.915 --> 15:17.415
Give us this day
our daily bread

15:17.498 --> 15:19.748
and forgive us our trespasses

15:19.873 --> 15:22.998
as we forgive
those who trespass against us.

15:23.415 --> 15:27.998
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

15:28.581 --> 15:31.665
The Almighty God,
the Father, the Son

15:31.748 --> 15:35.706
and the Holy Spirit
bless you. Amen.

15:36.498 --> 15:38.998
Now, as we receive
our new member

15:39.581 --> 15:43.998
into our parish, let us all
welcome him with great joy.

17:22.414 --> 17:25.915
Ride that thing really good!
Really good!

17:38.539 --> 17:40.082
You ride good, man.

17:40.665 --> 17:44.873
Would you like a ride into town?
Save you some gas, man.

17:56.207 --> 17:57.915
Just passing through?

17:58.040 --> 17:59.748
I'm just settling in.

17:59.831 --> 18:02.581
Where you staying?
Some fucking motel.

18:02.706 --> 18:04.748
Yeah. They are
no good around here.

18:04.873 --> 18:06.998
Whole town's gone to shit, man.

18:07.414 --> 18:09.082
So you got a job?

18:09.915 --> 18:10.998
No.

18:12.082 --> 18:13.998
You know your way
around an engine?

18:14.082 --> 18:15.498
Yeah.

18:15.831 --> 18:20.247
'Cause I got a shop,
repair shop, on Washout Road.

18:20.748 --> 18:21.956
You should come
check it out, man.

18:22.040 --> 18:24.498
I could always
use a good worker.

18:25.082 --> 18:26.414
All right.

18:27.165 --> 18:28.790
It ain't much.

18:30.082 --> 18:32.247
It's what it is,
you know, but it's mine.

18:33.247 --> 18:35.748
No one can kick me out of it.

18:37.123 --> 18:39.831
So,
that's the workshop in there.

18:40.581 --> 18:42.040
This is Tula.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.414
I don't get a whole lot
of work here, you know?

18:46.498 --> 18:49.748
But if you want, you can look for
other jobs or whatever, you know.

18:49.831 --> 18:51.498
If it's not enough for you.

18:53.873 --> 18:54.998
I do everything.

18:55.082 --> 18:58.082
Everything there is to do
to a car, I know how to do.

18:59.040 --> 19:02.082
Anything you don't know,
I can teach you, you know?

19:02.164 --> 19:05.748
And I got a trailer down here.
Stay there if you want.

19:11.665 --> 19:13.456
Yeah, see? She's shy.

19:15.623 --> 19:17.706
She can't see so good anymore.

19:18.082 --> 19:20.414
Where is it?
Where's the ball?

19:20.498 --> 19:22.247
There's the trailer.

19:23.373 --> 19:25.956
She get it? No, she ain't
gonna get it, man.

19:26.247 --> 19:28.748
You live out here all alone?
Yeah, I live alone.

19:29.998 --> 19:33.040
Sometimes people come
stay for a while, you know.

19:34.164 --> 19:37.164
That's it. It's not
much, but, you know,

19:37.831 --> 19:40.247
it's got whatever
you need in there.

19:48.956 --> 19:50.873
It must get lonely.

20:15.706 --> 20:17.464
<i>Look, Rob,
I don't wanna be ungrateful.</i>

20:17.498 --> 20:19.373
<i>I really appreciate what
you're doing for me and shit,</i>

20:19.456 --> 20:21.331
<i>but I gotta make
more fucking money.</i>

20:22.373 --> 20:24.831
<i>Hey, man, if I could
pay you more, I would.</i>

20:24.915 --> 20:27.831
<i>You know, you're good at what you do, man.
Really good.</i>

20:29.206 --> 20:30.806
<i>I could fix up
that ol' Mack truck</i>

20:30.831 --> 20:32.665
that's sitting there like a goddamn...
Well, that's good.

20:32.748 --> 20:33.986
You can go ahead and fix it up,

20:34.039 --> 20:36.081
but I don't have
the money to pay you.

20:37.081 --> 20:40.081
You know, there are other things
that could be done, you know.

20:41.581 --> 20:42.997
Like what?

20:44.164 --> 20:46.498
Well, you could rob a bank.

20:48.539 --> 20:50.748
You're full of shit.
I'm not full of shit.

20:52.039 --> 20:53.748
I've done it four times myself.

20:53.831 --> 20:57.122
I stopped 12 years ago because
it was getting too hot.

20:58.456 --> 21:02.081
As long as you don't do it
too many times, you're fine.

21:03.373 --> 21:06.331
You got a kid, you wanna
provide for that kid?

21:07.164 --> 21:10.081
You wanna maybe edge out
your competition?

21:11.997 --> 21:14.289
You gotta do that
using your skill set,

21:14.915 --> 21:17.706
and your skill set...

21:18.665 --> 21:20.081
Very unique.

21:23.039 --> 21:24.623
What do you say?

21:25.623 --> 21:27.539
Go fuck yourself.
Okay.

21:27.831 --> 21:32.081
Well, good luck supporting
your family on minimum wage.

21:37.623 --> 21:39.706
<i>He's my son
and I should be around him.</i>

21:39.955 --> 21:42.997
<i>I wasn't around my dad, look at
the fucking way I turned out.</i>

21:44.289 --> 21:46.498
Look, I wanna take care of you.

21:48.748 --> 21:51.331
I wanna take care of my son.
That's my job.

21:52.414 --> 21:54.831
Let me do my job. How are
you gonna take care of us?

21:56.581 --> 21:58.498
Don't say it like that.

21:59.164 --> 22:01.790
But how are you gonna take care of me?
Don't...

22:09.122 --> 22:10.955
Don't talk down to me.

22:12.539 --> 22:15.498
It's a question. I'm not
talking down to you.

22:15.830 --> 22:18.623
It's just a question.
I will find a way to do it.

22:20.456 --> 22:23.247
You want a house,
I'll get you a house.

22:24.289 --> 22:27.331
You wanna get the fuck out of
here, we'll get out of here.

22:27.414 --> 22:31.665
I got that trailer. I'll get
a truck, we'll hit the road.

22:34.373 --> 22:35.997
You pick a place
you like, we'll stop.

22:36.081 --> 22:38.914
You don't wanna be there?
"Fuck you," we're outta there.

22:41.122 --> 22:43.373
What about my mom?
She can come.

22:43.456 --> 22:45.706
And what about Kofi?
He can stay.

22:46.997 --> 22:50.414
He can get his own girl and his own kid.
That's every man's right.

22:57.914 --> 23:00.706
That sounds like a nice dream.
Ro...

23:38.164 --> 23:40.955
You can, uh, use this.
If you wanna.

23:41.039 --> 23:44.039
But keep in mind, man,
I did four banks with a note.

23:44.122 --> 23:45.830
In other words,
you don't need the gun.

23:46.331 --> 23:49.498
I never liked guns, man.
They're vulgar, you know.

23:49.581 --> 23:52.206
But you may wanna take it. I don't know.
Whatever you wanna do.

23:52.289 --> 23:53.789
How do we do it?

23:53.872 --> 23:57.414
Okay. First thing is, we're gonna
go in there nice and early.

23:57.498 --> 23:59.164
<i>Just when the doors open, okay?</i>

23:59.247 --> 24:00.965
<i>You're gonna take
a look at all the tellers.</i>

24:00.997 --> 24:04.414
<i>Go for the oldest
woman you can, right?</i>

24:04.498 --> 24:06.747
<i>Failing that,
go to the most meek.</i>

24:06.830 --> 24:09.955
You get her to put the money
out on the table. Why?

24:10.539 --> 24:13.122
So, that way, you can see
if there's a dye pack.

24:13.206 --> 24:15.830
You put it in your pocket. You
don't hand anything over to them.

24:15.914 --> 24:17.498
You don't show them the gun.

24:17.581 --> 24:18.997
<i>And you go.</i>

24:20.872 --> 24:23.539
<i>Get on your bike. I'll be
about four blocks away.</i>

24:23.622 --> 24:27.373
<i>Ride it into the truck. Bam, we're
home, we're done, we're rich.</i>

24:32.373 --> 24:33.830
<i>What happens if you get stopped</i>

24:33.914 --> 24:35.914
<i>sitting by the side of the
road with an open cube truck?</i>

24:35.997 --> 24:37.289
What are you gonna say?

24:37.373 --> 24:39.498
What do you mean, what am I gonna do?
I'm an officer.

24:39.581 --> 24:41.498
"Excuse me, sir, what are you
doing with an open cube truck?"

24:41.581 --> 24:43.539
"What are you doing? Why are
you sitting here like this?"

24:43.622 --> 24:47.206
Oh, I'm broken down. I'm waiting
for the, you know, repairs.

24:48.289 --> 24:50.664
Thank you for asking, Officer.

24:50.747 --> 24:52.164
That's a nice touch.
Right?

24:52.247 --> 24:53.885
What are you gonna do
if you get jock itch

24:53.914 --> 24:56.705
and, you know, you're riding 90
miles an hour down the street?

24:56.789 --> 24:58.705
You're gonna
keep riding, right?

24:58.789 --> 25:01.206
Yeah? I mean,
we do what we do.

25:02.081 --> 25:03.664
But when we do it together...

25:04.789 --> 25:06.622
Shazam.

25:07.414 --> 25:08.997
I'm just sayin'.

25:09.914 --> 25:11.952
Not since Hall and Oates
has there been such a team.

25:13.622 --> 25:15.164
Which one are you?
Oh, I know.

25:15.247 --> 25:17.289
So I gotta be the dark,
curly-haired guy?

25:17.373 --> 25:20.331
You gotta be the good-looking one?
I guess that's about right.

25:20.914 --> 25:23.705
<i>This is gonna be good, man.
You're gonna like doing this.</i>

25:23.789 --> 25:25.997
<i>It's the biggest
rush of your life.</i>

26:48.497 --> 26:49.664
Oh!

26:51.455 --> 26:54.206
All right!
Everybody who wants to live,

26:54.289 --> 26:56.039
put your hands
in the fucking air!

26:56.830 --> 26:58.331
Get over here!

26:58.538 --> 27:00.206
Get over here now!

27:00.664 --> 27:04.039
Get the fuck over here!
Get on your knees!

27:04.538 --> 27:06.664
All right.
What's your name?

27:06.747 --> 27:09.331
Max.
Max is my little fucking dog.

27:09.413 --> 27:11.997
Everybody get your fucking
money and he's gonna go fetch.

27:12.081 --> 27:13.839
Get it out and put it
on the table right now!

27:13.872 --> 27:16.206
Get it out! Pray!

27:16.789 --> 27:19.914
Pray! Let me hear
you fucking pray!

27:20.747 --> 27:24.497
Got that money out, boy?
Go fucking fetch. Fast!

27:28.455 --> 27:30.830
Get it out.
Put it in that bag.

28:58.455 --> 29:00.372
They're not turning!

29:03.413 --> 29:05.413
How much d'you get?

29:12.747 --> 29:14.205
On, baby.

29:14.789 --> 29:18.081
Oh! Beautiful
fucking baby boy!

29:20.664 --> 29:23.081
Are you okay, man?
You good?

29:25.081 --> 29:27.747
You did it, man!
You did it!

29:31.497 --> 29:33.622
Yes!

29:34.455 --> 29:35.747
God damn it, we fucking did it!

29:35.830 --> 29:37.497
We fucking did it!

29:55.997 --> 29:57.497
Yeah!

29:59.288 --> 30:00.705
Yeah!

30:32.121 --> 30:33.789
<i>Tell me about him.</i>

30:36.121 --> 30:37.955
<i>What's he like to eat?</i>

30:39.622 --> 30:42.580
He, like, really likes apples.

30:42.664 --> 30:44.955
But I have to kind of
chew it up for him.

30:45.038 --> 30:47.622
You chew up his apples?
Yeah.

30:48.246 --> 30:51.163
It sounds gross, but it's
not when I'm doing it.

31:01.747 --> 31:03.789
Has he ever had ice cream?

31:05.830 --> 31:07.246
Not yet.

31:07.747 --> 31:09.789
You're fucking kidding me.

31:09.996 --> 31:11.413
He's still a baby.

31:11.497 --> 31:12.996
Bullshit.

31:13.080 --> 31:15.038
What kind of house
are you running?

31:15.121 --> 31:17.080
No ice cream?

31:19.580 --> 31:21.497
Why can't he have that?

31:21.996 --> 31:24.830
It's not like he can't have
it, he just hasn't had it.

31:24.914 --> 31:26.705
Can I give it to him?

31:27.580 --> 31:29.830
You wanna give him ice cream?
Yeah.

31:30.538 --> 31:33.246
I wanna do something with him
that's his first time.

31:35.163 --> 31:37.081
I wanna look in his face
when he tries ice cream.

31:37.121 --> 31:39.199
Every time he has ice cream
for the rest of his life,

31:39.246 --> 31:41.580
he's gonna see my fucking face.

31:48.413 --> 31:50.580
Yeah.

31:55.872 --> 31:58.789
Okay, come on. Come on.
No, he's funny.

31:59.996 --> 32:01.622
Come on.

32:17.288 --> 32:18.913
Wanna hear it on?

32:26.163 --> 32:27.747
Oh!

32:28.954 --> 32:30.455
I'm sorry.

32:32.954 --> 32:34.996
Here. It's okay.

32:35.080 --> 32:36.497
He cries a lot.
I'm sorry.

32:36.830 --> 32:38.830
Oh, so you want
the bike in it, too?

32:38.913 --> 32:42.372
Yeah, just all... You know, so that...
Just capture the mood.

32:43.080 --> 32:44.830
It's a nice bike.

32:44.954 --> 32:47.205
The bike's part of the family.

32:52.080 --> 32:54.121
You want another one?

32:54.205 --> 32:56.913
You sure I should take
it when she's crying?

32:58.246 --> 32:59.664
Okay.

33:01.789 --> 33:03.789
That's a good trick.

33:10.580 --> 33:11.580
Shh!

33:11.747 --> 33:13.788
Five, six, seven... Put that
fucking money on the counter.

33:13.871 --> 33:15.788
Give me the real stuff. Don't
give me the fucking fake stuff.

33:15.871 --> 33:18.829
- I know what it is.
- Ten, 11, 12.

33:20.788 --> 33:23.205
Let me see you...
Come here. Come here.

33:41.497 --> 33:43.538
<i>- Hola, Mami.
- Hola.</i>

33:53.205 --> 33:55.664
What is this?

33:56.080 --> 33:57.996
What is...

33:59.746 --> 34:01.996
What is this?
It's presents.

34:06.996 --> 34:10.455
Oh, my God. What is that?
It's a crib.

34:11.913 --> 34:13.580
Easy, easy, easy.

34:13.664 --> 34:17.538
Hey, boss, you gotta stay...
You're gonna fall off this bed.

34:21.913 --> 34:23.413
There you go.

34:37.538 --> 34:39.246
Your mom's home.

34:40.746 --> 34:43.080
<i>Hi, Mami.
Think she's gonna be mad?</i>

34:54.621 --> 34:56.121
Hey.
Hey.

34:56.496 --> 34:58.080
What are you doing?

34:59.372 --> 35:01.954
I got him a crib and some toys.

35:03.996 --> 35:05.871
You know,
this is really nice and all,

35:05.954 --> 35:07.788
but you gotta
get this outta here.

35:08.663 --> 35:11.205
- You can't just show up like this.
- Why?

35:11.288 --> 35:13.788
'Cause this is
Kofi's fucking house.

35:13.871 --> 35:15.372
What?
Just get it out, please.

35:15.455 --> 35:17.038
He can't be sleeping in a bed.

35:17.121 --> 35:19.829
He's gonna roll out and bust his head open.
He needs a crib.

35:19.913 --> 35:21.580
What's going on?

35:24.330 --> 35:25.996
You okay with this?

35:28.996 --> 35:31.704
I'm talking to you. You okay with this?
Kofi, it's his father.

35:31.788 --> 35:34.829
In our house? You okay
with him in our house?

35:36.746 --> 35:38.871
What are you doing here, man? Shh-shh.
You're making him cry.

35:38.954 --> 35:40.829
Don't shush me.
You in my house, man.

35:40.913 --> 35:43.455
You need to pack all this shit
up and get out the house, man.

35:43.538 --> 35:45.871
I don't know who you think you
are, just coming up in our life

35:45.954 --> 35:47.996
and changing shit around,
but this ain't gonna work.

35:48.080 --> 35:50.205
You gotta lower your voice, man.
Excuse me?

35:50.330 --> 35:53.413
Lower your voice. Romina, can
you step outside, please?

35:54.246 --> 35:56.996
Pack all this shit up
and take it out, man.

35:58.413 --> 36:01.413
You're making the baby cry.
You're making the baby cry.

36:02.746 --> 36:04.784
Pick this shit up and get
it out the house now, man.

36:04.788 --> 36:07.038
I'm not fucking with you.

36:11.246 --> 36:13.788
Pick up all this shit, man.
Fuck you, man.

36:20.246 --> 36:22.372
<i>Mami, el niño! El niño!</i>

36:23.330 --> 36:26.537
Kofi. Kofi. Baby!

36:27.579 --> 36:29.163
<i>- Mami!
- Kofi!</i>

36:29.246 --> 36:30.746
Oh, God, baby!

36:30.829 --> 36:32.246
Baby.

36:36.246 --> 36:38.038
Kofi, baby.

36:38.579 --> 36:40.413
Baby.
Get off him.

36:41.246 --> 36:44.829
You're crazy!
You're fucking crazy!

36:44.913 --> 36:48.871
Get out! Get out! Get out!

36:53.163 --> 36:54.746
Please, please, please,
no, no, no.

36:54.871 --> 36:56.579
Okay. Call an ambulance.

36:56.704 --> 36:58.413
Oh, my God. Okay.

37:06.996 --> 37:08.496
It's okay.

37:12.579 --> 37:14.038
It's okay.

37:25.579 --> 37:26.996
It's okay.

37:29.954 --> 37:31.621
It's over.

37:35.579 --> 37:37.412
It's over.

37:41.704 --> 37:43.246
It's okay.

37:43.913 --> 37:45.412
It's okay.

37:50.330 --> 37:51.829
It's over.

37:56.163 --> 37:57.579
Right here.

38:04.579 --> 38:06.579
<i>Is your name Luke Glanton?</i>

38:06.663 --> 38:08.080
<i>Yes.</i>

38:08.163 --> 38:10.913
<i>Mr. Glanton,
a complaint has been filed.</i>

38:10.996 --> 38:12.913
<i>It alleges assault
in the second degree,</i>

38:12.996 --> 38:15.496
<i>which is a felony
in the state of New York.</i>

38:15.579 --> 38:17.163
<i>When such a complaint is filed,</i>

38:17.246 --> 38:20.329
<i>you have the right to an
adjournment to obtain a lawyer.</i>

38:20.829 --> 38:22.068
Counselor, do you wish to waive

38:22.080 --> 38:24.038
any further reading
of the arraignment?

38:24.121 --> 38:25.788
We would, Your Honor,
and on behalf of my client,

38:25.913 --> 38:27.829
I'd enter a Not Guilty plea.

38:28.246 --> 38:31.205
Given the history that I
am aware of, of this defendant,

38:31.287 --> 38:33.621
and, as well, the allegations,

38:33.746 --> 38:36.412
I'm going to set bail
in the amount of $2,500.

38:36.746 --> 38:39.913
Bail may be posted either in
cash or by bail bondsman.

38:39.996 --> 38:42.621
In the meantime, I will issue the
temporary order of protection

38:42.746 --> 38:46.329
requiring this defendant to
refrain from violent, offensive,

38:46.412 --> 38:48.329
<i>assaultive or harassing conduct</i>

38:48.412 --> 38:50.205
<i>and to remain away
from the complainant</i>

38:50.287 --> 38:51.913
<i>until further ordered...</i>

39:00.829 --> 39:03.788
There's your money.
Thanks for bailing me out.

39:09.579 --> 39:11.329
I wanna do two in one day.

39:12.954 --> 39:15.412
I wanna do
the Trustco on Brandywine.

39:16.412 --> 39:18.704
And when all those fucking
pigs are coming after me,

39:18.788 --> 39:21.829
I wanna split out the back,
I wanna go down to Rotterdam

39:21.913 --> 39:23.996
and I wanna do
that First National.

39:27.412 --> 39:29.204
You know something, Luke?

39:29.287 --> 39:31.496
If you ride like lightning,

39:32.746 --> 39:34.954
you're gonna
crash like thunder.

39:35.663 --> 39:38.038
And I'm not gonna let you
bring us both down.

39:38.121 --> 39:40.287
Fuck that. Don't be
such a fucking pussy.

39:40.412 --> 39:42.080
No, man. It's over.

39:42.996 --> 39:44.996
Can't do it. Won't do it.

39:48.080 --> 39:50.913
You made your fucking choice.
Fuck you.

39:52.245 --> 39:55.080
Hey, you know what?
If you go out tonight...

39:57.913 --> 40:00.746
Take the truck.
You'll be less visible.

40:00.829 --> 40:02.746
Last favor I'll do you.

40:03.121 --> 40:04.579
I'm done.

40:05.329 --> 40:07.412
You're fucking done?
Yeah.

40:07.746 --> 40:09.162
You're done?

40:10.245 --> 40:11.621
It's over.

41:18.579 --> 41:19.746
Ro.

41:24.120 --> 41:25.913
Just take this.
Just take it.

41:26.496 --> 41:30.496
Ro, I'm sorry.
I'm a fucking maniac.

41:30.913 --> 41:33.079
Ro, just take it. Ro.

41:36.412 --> 41:38.162
Can I get in the car, please?

41:38.245 --> 41:39.788
Just take this.

41:45.287 --> 41:46.746
<i>You don't love me,
you don't like me.</i>

41:46.829 --> 41:48.412
<i>I fucking get it.
I'm a piece of shit.</i>

41:48.788 --> 41:52.454
Okay? I'm still his father.
I can give him stuff.

41:52.954 --> 41:56.621
I got this for him. Just give it to him.
Tell him it's from me.

42:15.079 --> 42:16.746
<i>You're never
gonna see him again.</i>

42:24.245 --> 42:26.037
Please give that to him.

43:33.412 --> 43:34.788
Hey.

43:34.912 --> 43:37.329
Hey, it's okay.
It's all right.

43:37.621 --> 43:38.912
Open your mouth.

43:39.663 --> 43:41.120
Wider.

43:51.245 --> 43:53.162
You owe me a new bike.

43:53.828 --> 43:55.287
Right?

43:55.412 --> 43:57.120
Yeah.

43:57.204 --> 44:00.454
Where's that bail money?
Give it to me.

44:05.245 --> 44:06.746
I'm sorry.

44:25.995 --> 44:27.579
Fuck.

44:28.579 --> 44:29.745
Fuckin' Christ.

44:35.079 --> 44:36.579
Shit!

44:36.912 --> 44:38.329
Fucking idiot.

44:40.079 --> 44:42.245
Jesus fucking Christ.

44:42.745 --> 44:45.579
Everybody get down
on the fucking floor!

44:48.496 --> 44:51.454
You, get up!
Get the fuck up!

44:52.663 --> 44:54.181
Fill up that fucking bag
full of money.

44:55.496 --> 44:57.912
Don't look at me!
Put your... No faces!

44:57.995 --> 45:01.663
You! Get up!
Get up. Get up!

45:03.245 --> 45:05.745
Get the fuck up!
Get that fucking money!

45:05.828 --> 45:08.245
Put that fucking money in there!
Fuck! Okay, here it comes.

45:08.662 --> 45:10.953
What are you doing!
Throw it over!

45:12.287 --> 45:13.745
- Fuck.
- I'm sorry.

45:13.828 --> 45:15.537
I was...
Throw it over!

45:15.621 --> 45:18.287
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

45:18.412 --> 45:20.454
Where's that guy back there,
your fucking guy?

45:20.579 --> 45:23.245
Hey, guy! Get up!

45:23.662 --> 45:26.412
Throw that over, and you
better not fuck this up.

45:27.995 --> 45:29.662
Jesus Christ.

45:31.245 --> 45:32.621
This is fucking shit.

45:33.620 --> 45:35.245
Get the fuck down!

45:51.745 --> 45:53.454
Shit. Shit.

45:53.579 --> 45:55.496
Fuck you. Fuck you.

46:07.912 --> 46:11.662
Adam-5 in pursuit of robbery suspect.
North on Brandywine.

46:12.162 --> 46:14.454
Black jumpsuit, black helmet.

46:17.412 --> 46:20.412
Adam-5, suspect making turn
into Vale Cemetery.

46:25.787 --> 46:29.745
In Vale Cemetery, in pursuit
of suspect on motorcycle.

46:31.745 --> 46:33.620
Going towards Moyerson.

46:47.329 --> 46:49.828
Appears to have
a flat on rear tire.

46:49.912 --> 46:52.329
He's headed on to Moyerson,
he's heading towards State.

46:52.412 --> 46:53.912
Cut him off at State.

46:56.120 --> 46:58.912
Down the block at barricade
to State Street.

47:03.578 --> 47:05.745
Suspect is down.

47:06.412 --> 47:08.536
Suspect is going down
State Street!

47:08.620 --> 47:10.454
He got around
the barriers at Moyerson.

47:11.287 --> 47:13.162
<i>Heading south on Moyerson,</i>

47:13.245 --> 47:15.536
<i>heading towards State Street.</i>

47:15.620 --> 47:17.287
<i>Get cars to Plymouth.</i>

47:19.245 --> 47:22.120
<i>Suspect does have
a flat tire on rear.</i>

47:23.412 --> 47:26.536
104, I got a visual of motorcycle
heading south on Elmer.

47:30.079 --> 47:32.287
Heading west on Stanford.

47:35.745 --> 47:37.995
He is heading
north on Plymouth.

47:50.995 --> 47:52.620
Stay down!

47:52.745 --> 47:54.411
In foot pursuit.

48:08.411 --> 48:10.079
What are you doing?

48:10.329 --> 48:12.287
Come here. Come here!
Are you the only ones here?

48:12.411 --> 48:13.953
Yeah.
Come here.

48:14.079 --> 48:15.745
Okay. Okay.
Get the fuck over here.

48:15.828 --> 48:17.662
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Just get upstairs.

48:17.745 --> 48:19.162
Get upstairs!

48:19.912 --> 48:21.620
Go! Go! Go!

48:35.870 --> 48:36.995
I'm at 702 Plymouth.

48:37.079 --> 48:38.828
I need a backup unit for the
southeast corner of the house.

48:38.912 --> 48:40.311
I have
the northwest corner secured.

48:40.578 --> 48:42.204
Get down over there!

48:44.245 --> 48:45.620
Fuck.

48:55.912 --> 48:57.578
Fuck. Fuck.

49:16.328 --> 49:17.912
Get outta here.

49:41.620 --> 49:44.912
Get down! Get down on the ground!
Get down on the ground!

49:45.079 --> 49:47.745
- Is anybody else inside?
- Yes! He's upstairs!

49:57.828 --> 49:59.745
- Police!
- Ro?

49:59.828 --> 50:01.453
Ro, don't hang up.

50:08.079 --> 50:09.578
I'm in trouble.

50:11.787 --> 50:14.578
I'm...
I'm in some lady's house.

50:25.411 --> 50:27.912
Ro, would you do
a favor for me, please?

50:29.620 --> 50:32.120
Just one thing. I'll never
ask for anything again.

50:32.787 --> 50:33.787
Police!

50:42.578 --> 50:44.995
Look, don't tell him
about me, okay?

50:46.578 --> 50:48.912
Police!
Put your gun down!

50:49.953 --> 50:53.912
Ro, just don't
tell him about me.

50:55.453 --> 50:57.787
Ro.

50:57.912 --> 51:00.119
Okay? Police! Lay
down on your stomach

51:00.244 --> 51:01.328
with your hands spread apart!
Ro?

51:01.411 --> 51:03.453
Face away from the door!
Ro, please.

51:03.578 --> 51:05.161
Police! Drop your...

51:06.912 --> 51:09.453
Oh, fuck.

51:26.745 --> 51:30.244
104, I'm at 702 Plymouth.
Shots fired. Perp's down.

51:30.328 --> 51:33.078
I've been shot. Send a box
and a bus to 702 Plymouth.

51:40.078 --> 51:41.495
Let's see your fucking hands!

51:41.578 --> 51:42.662
Get those fucking hands up now!

51:42.745 --> 51:44.453
Get your fucking hands up, now!

51:44.578 --> 51:45.995
Get the fucking
hands up right now!

51:46.078 --> 51:47.161
Clyde, you all right?

51:47.286 --> 51:49.578
- I got him. I got him.
- Okay? Do not move!

51:49.662 --> 51:50.995
Get me another cop back here!

52:06.453 --> 52:08.078
Baby?

52:11.286 --> 52:12.745
Hey.
Hey.

52:20.912 --> 52:22.411
Hi.

52:24.411 --> 52:25.912
Hi.

52:26.370 --> 52:29.828
Uh-oh.
What's my dad doing here?

52:29.912 --> 52:31.578
We're all here.

52:32.745 --> 52:35.745
Do you remember
what happened? Any of it?

52:38.328 --> 52:40.912
Hey, honey, don't... Don't... It's all right.
It's all right.

52:41.952 --> 52:43.787
Don't do that. Leave it.

52:43.912 --> 52:45.536
Hey, hey, hey, honey, just...
Not... AL: Avery.

52:45.620 --> 52:47.912
Hey, honey. Avery!

52:47.994 --> 52:51.244
Avery, you got a bad injury.

52:51.328 --> 52:53.328
You gotta take it easy.

52:53.411 --> 52:55.203
It's okay, honey.
Just gotta relax, okay?

52:55.286 --> 52:56.328
ALI All right?

52:56.411 --> 52:57.828
We're all here.
Okay, okay, yeah.

52:57.912 --> 53:00.495
You understand?
Yeah.

53:02.244 --> 53:04.411
I'm sorry.

53:05.286 --> 53:08.286
I'm sorry. JENNIFER: It's okay.
Hey, baby.

53:08.994 --> 53:11.119
We're all here.
It's okay. It's okay.

53:14.578 --> 53:15.994
It's okay. It's okay.
You just gotta rest...

53:16.078 --> 53:18.119
You're gonna be in here
a couple of days. All right?

53:18.203 --> 53:20.244
That's it.
A couple of days.

53:24.078 --> 53:26.119
Good morning, Mr. Cross.

53:26.203 --> 53:27.722
You feeling up to
a couple of visitors?

53:27.787 --> 53:29.828
There's a couple men
who wanna speak to you.

53:29.911 --> 53:31.328
Avery.

53:31.828 --> 53:33.620
Hey.
How's our hero?

53:33.745 --> 53:35.223
Chief. How you feeling?
You all right?

53:35.286 --> 53:36.703
I'm good, yeah, yeah. They
taking good care of you?

53:36.787 --> 53:37.828
Yes, sir. Thank you.

53:37.911 --> 53:39.328
Sausage and pepper.
Thanks for coming out.

53:39.411 --> 53:40.828
From Sabatiello's.
Oh, how are you?

53:40.911 --> 53:42.949
Bill Killcullen, DA. Avery Cross.
Nice to meet you.

53:42.994 --> 53:44.578
Nice to meet you. Oh, of course.
I know who you are.

53:44.662 --> 53:46.536
I know your father, you know.
Long time now.

53:46.662 --> 53:48.952
I apologize. No, not at all.
He's a great guy.

53:49.078 --> 53:50.578
I wouldn't have expected
anything less from his son,

53:50.662 --> 53:52.745
but this was above and beyond.

53:52.828 --> 53:54.578
I just did what
anybody would do, right?

53:54.662 --> 53:56.411
That's right. And better.

53:56.495 --> 53:57.536
I don't know about that...

53:57.620 --> 53:59.536
The whole force is pulling for you, man.
Don't you forget that.

53:59.620 --> 54:01.244
They're all outside.
Banners, everything.

54:01.286 --> 54:04.578
What happened to that guy? That guy's gone.
He's dead. It's over.

54:05.745 --> 54:07.911
That's the way it happens.
Right?

54:07.994 --> 54:09.662
Yeah, but did he
leave anybody behind?

54:09.745 --> 54:12.370
That's not... It's not for you
to worry about right now.

54:12.453 --> 54:14.536
We got people who are
gonna talk to you about that.

54:14.620 --> 54:16.411
There's people
talking to his family.

54:16.495 --> 54:19.703
Got rid of another bad guy.
And you're a hero.

54:20.328 --> 54:21.703
All right?
Yeah.

54:21.787 --> 54:23.536
Bill wants to ask you a few questions.
Is that all right?

54:23.620 --> 54:25.453
It's just your first
impressions, that kind of thing.

54:25.578 --> 54:27.036
- Just what...
- Formality, you know?

54:27.078 --> 54:28.517
Yeah, it's pretty simple.
Yeah. Sure.

54:28.578 --> 54:30.495
All right, I'll leave you two
to get to know each other.

54:30.578 --> 54:31.911
Oh. All right.

54:32.578 --> 54:36.286
So what happened when you
were just outside the door?

54:36.745 --> 54:39.453
Um, I said,
"Police, drop your weapon."

54:40.495 --> 54:43.578
Um, "Face down on the ground
with your hands spread."

54:44.536 --> 54:46.203
And, uh, nothing.

54:46.286 --> 54:47.994
Nothing, right.
Nothing.

54:48.078 --> 54:49.411
Did you announce
yourself again, or not?

54:49.495 --> 54:53.495
No. No, that's all we need to do
is make ourselves known, right?

54:54.536 --> 54:57.328
Yeah, but it's sometimes
not easy to tell

54:57.411 --> 55:00.203
whether they've heard you
making yourself known.

55:01.578 --> 55:03.370
You know what I mean?

55:03.453 --> 55:05.370
Anyway, you were yelling.
Is that right?

55:05.453 --> 55:07.662
I was making myself known
as we were trained, correct.

55:07.744 --> 55:09.244
Okay. All right.

55:10.620 --> 55:13.078
Okay. Then what?

55:14.119 --> 55:17.578
At that point, I knew that I had to
make entry, and I kicked the door down.

55:18.203 --> 55:20.161
Was then. Was the door locked?
Correct.

55:20.244 --> 55:21.536
And you knew that because...

55:22.328 --> 55:23.453
What do you mean?

55:23.536 --> 55:25.174
You just assumed that
the door was locked?

55:25.244 --> 55:27.328
How did I know it was locked?
Yeah.

55:28.744 --> 55:30.286
Is that a trick question?

55:30.370 --> 55:32.453
No. No. I'm just wondering
why you didn't turn the thing.

55:32.536 --> 55:34.370
That's how I knew
it was locked.

55:34.911 --> 55:36.495
Did you tell me that?

55:36.578 --> 55:38.078
No.
Okay.

55:40.411 --> 55:41.827
All right, so you kick it in.
Right.

55:41.911 --> 55:44.453
Why are you...
Why'd you come down here?

55:44.536 --> 55:45.934
I'm sorry, why did
I come down here?

55:45.952 --> 55:47.286
Yeah.
Why wasn't somebody else...

55:47.370 --> 55:49.244
A slow day at the office or...

55:52.370 --> 55:53.411
No.

55:56.952 --> 55:59.994
What happened after that? What
would you like me to tell you?

56:00.661 --> 56:02.078
I just need you to
tell me what happened.

56:02.161 --> 56:03.244
You do?

56:03.328 --> 56:05.827
I don't want you to
misremember so, tomorrow,

56:05.911 --> 56:08.203
you're trying to match
what you half-thought today.

56:08.661 --> 56:12.661
I only want you to tell me what
you saw and what you remember.

56:13.078 --> 56:15.328
I shot the perpetrator,
he fell out the window.

56:16.578 --> 56:19.036
I know that.
When did he pull his gun?

56:20.994 --> 56:23.786
Did you shoot him first,
or did he shoot first?

56:26.827 --> 56:28.328
Don't fuck with me.

56:28.411 --> 56:31.244
Do the right thing, tell
me what the fuck happened.

56:32.411 --> 56:34.036
It was pretty quick.

56:36.244 --> 56:37.744
Who shot first?

56:39.619 --> 56:41.994
His hand comes up, you fire?

56:43.078 --> 56:45.495
His hand comes up,
he fires, you fire?

56:45.744 --> 56:47.453
Right.
Like that?

56:49.036 --> 56:50.744
Yeah.
Like pop-pop.

56:52.744 --> 56:54.661
That sounds like he shot first.

56:55.119 --> 56:56.577
Yeah.

56:56.952 --> 56:59.911
<i>Well, it's just a
triumphant day for Officer Avery Cross.</i>

56:59.994 --> 57:04.161
<i>He left Ellis Hospital well enough
to go home and happy to be alive,</i>

57:04.286 --> 57:07.869
<i>with supporters from his Schenectady
PD family cheering him on.</i>

57:07.952 --> 57:10.370
<i>His father, State Supreme
Court Judge AI Cross,</i>

57:10.453 --> 57:13.119
<i>says he's very happy
his son is alive today.</i>

57:13.203 --> 57:15.203
<i>There's the life of a cop,</i>

57:15.911 --> 57:17.786
<i>the life my son chose.</i>

57:18.286 --> 57:21.523
<i>Twenty-nine-year-old Cross hadn't
even been on the force for a full year</i>

57:21.535 --> 57:24.994
<i>before he ran head-on
into the alleged Moto Bandit.</i>

57:25.078 --> 57:27.577
<i>Pursuing Luke Glanton through
the streets of Schenectady</i>

57:27.661 --> 57:31.286
<i>after a bank robbery, Glanton
ran into a home, then he came</i>

57:31.411 --> 57:33.494
<i>face-to-face with Officer Cross.
You okay?</i>

57:33.577 --> 57:36.203
<i>Glanton fired at Cross,
hitting him in the knee.</i>

57:36.286 --> 57:39.911
<i>Cross fired back, killing Glanton
and saving the hostages.</i>

57:39.994 --> 57:43.619
<i>Glanton was a drifter and, at
times, a motorcycle stunt rider,</i>

57:43.702 --> 57:46.119
<i>and police say he had
a very violent past.</i>

57:46.494 --> 57:48.494
<i>The guy had
a long track record, you know?</i>

57:48.577 --> 57:50.078
<i>He was a professional criminal.</i>

57:50.161 --> 57:51.599
<i>He moved here last spring,</i>

57:51.661 --> 57:53.244
<i>and he hadn't even been here
for a full month</i>

57:53.328 --> 57:55.911
<i>before he started
robbing banks here.</i>

57:56.411 --> 57:58.702
<i>He leaves behind an infant son.</i>

57:58.994 --> 58:00.994
<i>Coming up, Dallas and Denver...</i>

58:04.452 --> 58:06.452
Was it scary, honey?

58:07.411 --> 58:09.203
Happened so fast.

58:09.619 --> 58:12.119
I don't think there was
time to be scared.

58:13.203 --> 58:14.952
Scary for me.

58:17.078 --> 58:20.744
I just don't understand why
you're doing this. Nobody does.

58:22.827 --> 58:25.286
Doing what?
What am I doing?

58:28.286 --> 58:31.078
I was speaking
with your father and we...

58:33.328 --> 58:36.702
We both agree...
Of course he does.

58:36.786 --> 58:38.494
I'm sorry.
I just thought that...

58:38.577 --> 58:40.452
I'm a cop, Jen. I'm a cop.
That's it. There's no...

58:40.535 --> 58:42.494
I just thought maybe after this,
maybe you would've had enough.

58:42.577 --> 58:43.702
Hey, there's no more
to discuss.

58:43.786 --> 58:46.911
That's all. I just thought
maybe you would've had enough.

58:46.994 --> 58:48.494
That's it. Okay?

58:50.410 --> 58:53.702
Baby, you can't expect me not to think that.
You guys just don't get it.

58:53.786 --> 58:55.328
You guys just don't get it.

58:57.911 --> 59:00.269
I'm sorry. We're just worried.
We're just worried about you.

59:00.328 --> 59:01.786
Stop saying that.
That's all.

59:01.869 --> 59:05.078
Stop fucking saying that.

59:14.911 --> 59:18.286
<i>Have you been replaying
the incident in your mind?</i>

59:19.161 --> 59:20.952
Not really.
Mmm-hmm.

59:21.619 --> 59:24.744
No, I'm trying to put it
out of my mind, I think.

59:25.827 --> 59:27.577
Does that work?

59:27.661 --> 59:29.078
Yeah.

59:31.244 --> 59:34.619
You think you're ready
to go back to duty?

59:34.702 --> 59:36.286
Yes.

59:37.286 --> 59:39.994
Would you want
yourself as a partner?

59:40.078 --> 59:41.619
Absolutely.

59:43.535 --> 59:46.203
What have you been thinking
about since the shooting?

59:46.285 --> 59:47.452
Not much, um...

59:49.869 --> 59:56.452
Everything's been so crazy,
you know, with the rehabilitation

59:58.661 --> 01:00:00.827
and work
and everything at home.

01:00:01.535 --> 01:00:04.161
Mmm-hmm. Everything at home?
What's happening at home?

01:00:05.203 --> 01:00:09.911
Well, I'm there
now, which is much different.

01:00:09.994 --> 01:00:12.036
Who's at home with you?
Um...

01:00:12.119 --> 01:00:16.078
Well, uh, my mother-in-law,
uh, my wife and my boy.

01:00:16.702 --> 01:00:18.285
So there's, um...

01:00:19.161 --> 01:00:21.994
You know, it's been hard on my wife.
It's a shock.

01:00:22.911 --> 01:00:25.327
And then, um,
it doesn't help that

01:00:25.410 --> 01:00:27.078
there's a...
You know, a baby around.

01:00:27.203 --> 01:00:29.327
But it's okay.
I mean, it's okay.

01:00:31.119 --> 01:00:34.661
What do you mean, "it doesn't
help that there's a baby around?"

01:00:35.535 --> 01:00:38.577
Well, I just mean, with everything that's...
That's going on...

01:00:40.036 --> 01:00:44.327
Just trying to... To get
all this in order, uh...

01:00:44.410 --> 01:00:46.410
Before I can take care of that.

01:00:46.494 --> 01:00:47.952
It's been...

01:00:50.702 --> 01:00:56.161
I've just been so busy
that it's been hard to, uh...

01:01:04.869 --> 01:01:06.952
I have a...
I have a hard time

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:15.369
looking at my son.

01:01:15.452 --> 01:01:16.661
Mmm-hmm.

01:01:16.744 --> 01:01:19.285
And that's something new,
since the shooting?

01:01:19.452 --> 01:01:21.285
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.

01:01:22.827 --> 01:01:25.036
You know,
I saw in the police record

01:01:25.119 --> 01:01:28.327
that this perp also
had a 1-year-old son.

01:01:29.827 --> 01:01:33.535
His name is Jason. Have you
been thinking about this?

01:01:40.078 --> 01:01:41.577
This? You mean...

01:01:43.410 --> 01:01:46.786
The fact that he had a boy?

01:01:46.869 --> 01:01:51.160
Yeah. Do you think you're having
a hard time looking at your son

01:01:51.243 --> 01:01:53.661
because you're thinking
about this other little boy

01:01:53.744 --> 01:01:55.494
that won't have his father?

01:02:31.952 --> 01:02:34.243
You expecting someone?
No. You?

01:02:34.327 --> 01:02:35.994
Hey!
Hi.

01:02:36.410 --> 01:02:38.452
Hi.
How you doing?

01:02:38.535 --> 01:02:40.452
Hey.
Hey, how's the gimp doing?

01:02:40.535 --> 01:02:42.243
Hey, come on in, guys.

01:02:42.327 --> 01:02:43.661
No, we're just coming in here

01:02:43.744 --> 01:02:45.118
to check up on you and see
how you're doing.

01:02:45.202 --> 01:02:47.240
Hi, how are you, Jen? I'm good.
How are you, Scotty?

01:02:47.243 --> 01:02:48.952
Oh, I'm all right, doing
good, better than this guy.

01:02:49.035 --> 01:02:50.327
Oh, he's okay.

01:02:50.410 --> 01:02:52.827
Come on in. How you doing?
Hey, Pete, how are you?

01:02:52.911 --> 01:02:54.327
Good.
Good to see you.

01:02:54.410 --> 01:02:56.160
Good to see you, too. Did you
ever meet my wife, Jennifer?

01:02:56.243 --> 01:02:57.619
No. Hi. It's a real
pleasure to meet you.

01:02:57.702 --> 01:02:58.993
Hello.
Hey, how are you?

01:02:59.077 --> 01:03:00.494
Know Doc?
Yeah, we've never met,

01:03:00.577 --> 01:03:01.786
but Avery Cross.
How you doing?

01:03:01.869 --> 01:03:03.285
Good. How you doing, pal?
That's my wife, Jennifer.

01:03:03.369 --> 01:03:05.369
Hey, how are you?
Nice to meet you. Hi.

01:03:05.452 --> 01:03:06.869
You guys hungry?

01:03:07.494 --> 01:03:10.035
No, we're... We'll just
leave you to it.

01:03:10.118 --> 01:03:11.202
No, come on in,
have some dinner.

01:03:11.285 --> 01:03:12.911
No, we didn't
come here for dinner.

01:03:12.951 --> 01:03:16.160
We got plenty of food. Come on in.
Well, I...

01:03:16.410 --> 01:03:18.369
There you go.
Oh, yeah.

01:03:19.869 --> 01:03:21.410
Glad we decided to do this.

01:03:21.494 --> 01:03:23.619
Oh, good.
I'm glad you guys came.

01:03:24.494 --> 01:03:25.661
Here you go.
Thanks.

01:03:26.243 --> 01:03:27.827
So how's it feel
to have the hero home?

01:03:27.911 --> 01:03:30.911
Probably can't wait for him to
get back to work, huh?

01:03:30.993 --> 01:03:32.577
No, it's great having him home.

01:03:32.661 --> 01:03:35.702
I just thank God
he's okay, you know?

01:03:35.786 --> 01:03:38.494
God bless that. I think
we should toast on that.

01:03:38.577 --> 01:03:40.869
- To our hero.
- To hero boy.

01:03:40.951 --> 01:03:42.702
- Hero boy.
- There you go.

01:03:42.786 --> 01:03:44.452
Glad you're okay.

01:03:44.869 --> 01:03:46.619
I've been on
the force for 22 years,

01:03:46.702 --> 01:03:48.786
pulled a trigger
maybe three, four times.

01:03:48.869 --> 01:03:51.993
You're on for six months, you
already got one in the bag.

01:03:52.077 --> 01:03:54.285
And he was white.

01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:57.118
That's an extra 50.

01:03:57.577 --> 01:03:58.910
Oh, better him than me, right?

01:03:58.951 --> 01:04:00.369
- Hey, you got that right.
- Absolutely.

01:04:00.452 --> 01:04:02.535
You guys have any
plans for tonight?

01:04:03.452 --> 01:04:04.452
Um...

01:04:04.577 --> 01:04:07.910
No, we're just... This is it.
Yeah?

01:04:07.993 --> 01:04:10.577
This is the big plan, having
you guys here for dinner.

01:04:10.702 --> 01:04:14.160
Aw! Would you mind
if we stole the hero

01:04:14.243 --> 01:04:16.619
for a little police work
after this?

01:04:18.077 --> 01:04:19.285
Uh...

01:04:19.410 --> 01:04:21.910
Tonight? And we'll have
him back by curfew.

01:04:24.910 --> 01:04:28.327
I don't know, honey, you
should probably rest tonight.

01:04:28.410 --> 01:04:29.702
Maybe tomorrow night.

01:04:29.786 --> 01:04:33.035
Yeah, we kind of need him tonight.
Is there a problem?

01:04:33.118 --> 01:04:35.494
What about your leg, or...

01:04:35.577 --> 01:04:37.868
Well, we're not gonna be running.
We'll carry him.

01:04:37.951 --> 01:04:39.993
What are you gonna do?

01:04:40.077 --> 01:04:41.955
We just wanna introduce
him to a bunch of people

01:04:42.035 --> 01:04:44.535
who really admire him
for what he did.

01:04:44.619 --> 01:04:46.786
They just wanna
congratulate him in person.

01:04:47.619 --> 01:04:49.410
Good, yeah, that sounds good.

01:04:49.494 --> 01:04:51.744
Leave in about 20 minutes?

01:04:51.826 --> 01:04:55.243
Not that we wanna eat and
run, but we are on duty.

01:04:55.327 --> 01:04:57.118
No, you should go.
That's a great idea.

01:04:57.202 --> 01:04:58.910
I'm sure everybody
would love to meet you.

01:04:59.035 --> 01:05:02.243
Yeah, there you have it.
You're a hero.

01:05:03.661 --> 01:05:05.702
I hear a little
sarcasm in your voice.

01:05:05.785 --> 01:05:06.993
Me?
Yeah.

01:05:07.077 --> 01:05:08.327
He is a hero.
Yeah.

01:05:08.410 --> 01:05:09.785
He's a hero around here,
that's for sure.

01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:11.535
You don't mind if we take him
then, do you? Not at all.

01:05:11.577 --> 01:05:14.494
I think it's a great idea. Yeah,
all right, there you have it.

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:17.285
You're released.
Release the hounds!

01:05:17.369 --> 01:05:19.077
Yeah.

01:05:26.619 --> 01:05:28.035
Hey, Avery,

01:05:28.118 --> 01:05:31.327
does she sometimes, like, tuck
her balls up, at least at night?

01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:37.118
Hey, Pete? Pete?
What?

01:05:37.243 --> 01:05:40.160
- Can you pop the trunk?
- Sure it's okay with her?

01:05:44.910 --> 01:05:47.452
Scott, you know I'm not
on active duty, right?

01:05:47.535 --> 01:05:50.577
Yeah, we're aware. It's a little
gift we got going for you.

01:05:52.327 --> 01:05:54.077
Let's go!

01:05:58.619 --> 01:06:00.077
Police.

01:06:00.327 --> 01:06:02.910
Yes?
Hi. Romina Gutierrez, please.

01:06:02.993 --> 01:06:04.951
That's the woman, right there.
Romina.

01:06:05.035 --> 01:06:06.452
Yeah.

01:06:08.494 --> 01:06:11.577
Hi. Hi, I'm Officer Deluca.
Romina Gutierrez?

01:06:11.661 --> 01:06:14.327
Yeah. Yeah, we're here
to search your house.

01:06:14.743 --> 01:06:16.577
What for?
For evidence.

01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:18.660
Evidence for what?
We're looking for the money

01:06:18.743 --> 01:06:21.035
that Luke Glanton may or
may not have given to you.

01:06:21.118 --> 01:06:23.494
Yeah, well, we don't have
anything that...

01:06:24.701 --> 01:06:26.535
You can't just walk in here.

01:06:26.619 --> 01:06:27.951
Yeah, I can.
No, you can't.

01:06:28.035 --> 01:06:30.452
Why's that?
'Cause it's my house.

01:06:31.077 --> 01:06:34.118
Look, you assume
that I have a warrant,

01:06:34.202 --> 01:06:36.701
and I'll assume that
your mother has papers, okay?

01:06:38.243 --> 01:06:40.160
This won't take long.

01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:42.369
- Come on.
- Kofi.

01:06:43.118 --> 01:06:45.118
- We're just gonna start upstairs, okay?
- No, no, no, no.

01:06:45.202 --> 01:06:46.618
No, no, my baby's upstairs.

01:06:46.701 --> 01:06:48.243
My baby's upstairs sleeping.
Your baby's...

01:06:48.327 --> 01:06:49.646
Yeah, my baby's
upstairs sleeping,

01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:51.618
so, no, we're not
gonna start up there.

01:06:51.701 --> 01:06:53.118
No, no, no, don't go up there.

01:06:53.243 --> 01:06:55.993
Romina, hey, relax, relax, relax.
He can't go up there.

01:06:56.077 --> 01:06:58.452
Yeah, he can. You can
go up there if you want.

01:06:58.535 --> 01:06:59.993
But if we find evidence
while you're up there,

01:07:00.077 --> 01:07:01.785
you're under arrest.
For what?

01:07:01.868 --> 01:07:05.202
We've done this a lot of times, okay?
It'll be quiet.

01:07:06.077 --> 01:07:08.077
Go on, Scotty. Be quiet.

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:12.993
How about a cup of coffee?

01:07:13.077 --> 01:07:14.785
Yes, yes, yes.
That'd be great.

01:07:16.285 --> 01:07:18.535
Is it all right if I go
into your living room here?

01:07:18.618 --> 01:07:20.285
Yeah, go ahead.
Thanks.

01:07:26.993 --> 01:07:28.494
I'm sorry for your loss.

01:07:34.910 --> 01:07:37.285
Romina, let's go. Come on.

01:07:55.243 --> 01:07:57.285
What are we doing?
What are we doing here?

01:07:57.369 --> 01:07:59.285
Hey, this is crazy.

01:08:00.534 --> 01:08:02.202
Wait outside. I don't want...
No, we gotta go.

01:08:02.285 --> 01:08:03.868
This is fucked-up.

01:08:03.951 --> 01:08:05.829
Why the fuck are we here?
Let go of my arm, man.

01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:08.327
What the fuck are we doing here?
Let go of my arm.

01:08:08.410 --> 01:08:11.035
Scott, what the fuck are we doing here?
Shut up.

01:08:16.576 --> 01:08:19.077
- How long did you know Luke?
- A couple years.

01:08:19.576 --> 01:08:22.618
Did you know he was robbing banks?
No.

01:08:22.743 --> 01:08:24.826
You didn't know that at all? No.

01:08:24.910 --> 01:08:28.743
Let me just ask you one more time,
because this is what we do.

01:08:29.243 --> 01:08:32.743
You have no knowledge
to this money? No.

01:08:32.826 --> 01:08:34.202
Officer, I swear to God.

01:08:34.285 --> 01:08:36.035
It's not here?
No.

01:08:36.118 --> 01:08:37.243
It's not outside?

01:08:38.451 --> 01:08:40.160
If I was gonna hide something,

01:08:40.243 --> 01:08:42.910
I would hide it
closest to my heart.

01:08:49.410 --> 01:08:50.576
Scott.

01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:58.368
Pick him up.

01:08:59.243 --> 01:09:00.493
Pick up the baby.

01:09:00.576 --> 01:09:01.826
I don't think
we should do this.

01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:03.618
I don't wanna wake him.
I don't wanna pick him up.

01:09:03.701 --> 01:09:04.785
Pick him up.

01:09:44.576 --> 01:09:45.993
I'm good.

01:09:48.118 --> 01:09:50.202
Put him back and let's go.

01:10:22.118 --> 01:10:23.951
What's up?
Yeah, they're clean.

01:10:26.284 --> 01:10:29.409
All right-y.
We'll get out of your hair.

01:10:31.826 --> 01:10:33.493
What do you
got there, Scotty? Come on.

01:10:33.576 --> 01:10:35.077
Help him out, will you?

01:10:35.202 --> 01:10:37.519
Scotty, stop. Stop. You gotta
give me a chance to count it.

01:10:37.534 --> 01:10:39.910
You gonna count like that, we're gonna
be here till 5:00 in the morning.

01:10:39.993 --> 01:10:41.073
How are you gonna count it?

01:10:41.077 --> 01:10:43.202
Got a money counter in your asshole?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:10:43.284 --> 01:10:45.826
Fourteen grand.
$14,000.

01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:48.035
Well, it's not gonna be
an even split

01:10:48.118 --> 01:10:51.035
because the lion's share's
going to our hero.

01:10:51.118 --> 01:10:53.785
Consider it
unofficial hazard pay.

01:10:56.409 --> 01:10:58.618
From us to you.

01:10:59.910 --> 01:11:01.451
Enjoy it.

01:11:01.534 --> 01:11:04.202
'Cause you're not gonna
get it from the department.

01:11:04.284 --> 01:11:07.368
Don't spend it
all in one place.

01:11:07.451 --> 01:11:10.160
Fucking earned that.
Don't forget that.

01:11:10.242 --> 01:11:11.660
Not bad, huh?

01:11:11.743 --> 01:11:13.868
Not bad for a night's work.

01:11:37.326 --> 01:11:41.826
<i>We're gathered here to
celebrate a cop who makes other cops proud.</i>

01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:43.660
<i>We can all rest
a little easier at night</i>

01:11:43.743 --> 01:11:46.201
<i>now that he's on
the path to recovery.</i>

01:11:46.284 --> 01:11:48.826
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Officer Avery Cross.</i>

01:11:54.576 --> 01:11:57.743
Thank you. Thank you, Chief.
Thank you for your support.

01:11:59.077 --> 01:12:03.618
<i>When I was in law school, we used
to always talk about justice.</i>

01:12:03.701 --> 01:12:05.576
<i>We'd have
discussions about justice.</i>

01:12:07.868 --> 01:12:09.910
<i>That's just what they were...</i>

01:12:10.826 --> 01:12:12.077
<i>Discussions.</i>

01:12:12.159 --> 01:12:13.743
<i>I joined the police force</i>

01:12:13.826 --> 01:12:16.242
<i>because I wanted to work alongside
the brave men and women</i>

01:12:16.326 --> 01:12:20.077
<i>who know that some problems
can't be solved by talking.</i>

01:12:20.159 --> 01:12:21.719
<i>Now, no one wants
to be in the situation</i>

01:12:21.743 --> 01:12:23.993
<i>I found myself in
a couple weeks ago.</i>

01:12:24.576 --> 01:12:27.159
<i>I certainly wish that
it turned out differently.</i>

01:12:28.076 --> 01:12:32.284
<i>I'm not gonna lie. Sometimes
I even wish that</i>

01:12:32.368 --> 01:12:36.201
<i>maybe it wasn't me that was
called upon that house that day.</i>

01:12:36.951 --> 01:12:38.660
<i>But that's the job.</i>

01:12:39.284 --> 01:12:42.368
<i>And I can't think of another line
of work that I'd rather be in.</i>

01:12:42.451 --> 01:12:44.409
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:13:02.284 --> 01:13:03.785
How's it feel?

01:13:05.993 --> 01:13:08.117
I'm not sure
it's doing much good.

01:13:09.242 --> 01:13:10.660
How's the spotlight?

01:13:11.368 --> 01:13:13.409
I'm ready for it to end.

01:13:14.242 --> 01:13:16.409
Look, don't worry, it will.

01:13:17.618 --> 01:13:19.576
You know, the police
always put on a big show

01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:21.576
when something
like this happens

01:13:21.951 --> 01:13:24.743
'cause the hero card's the
only one they have to play.

01:13:24.826 --> 01:13:25.992
I'm not really
thinking about that, Dad.

01:13:26.076 --> 01:13:28.159
I'm just trying
to get back to work.

01:13:28.242 --> 01:13:29.681
You know, Avery,
if you planned this,

01:13:29.701 --> 01:13:31.576
it couldn't have
turned out any better.

01:13:32.326 --> 01:13:35.368
But you're not gonna make it work
for you in the police department.

01:13:35.451 --> 01:13:36.992
I promise you that.

01:13:37.493 --> 01:13:40.576
I didn't come here to be lectured, Dad.
You tricked me.

01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:42.618
You said the pool
would be good for my knee.

01:13:43.743 --> 01:13:44.951
Sorry.

01:13:45.034 --> 01:13:46.826
You know, I'm not
as calculated as you.

01:13:47.326 --> 01:13:49.368
You know,
my life's not a campaign.

01:13:49.451 --> 01:13:51.451
It's much simpler.
Yeah.

01:13:51.950 --> 01:13:53.743
Well, for somebody
not campaigning,

01:13:53.826 --> 01:13:55.950
you gave a hell of
a speech yesterday.

01:13:56.076 --> 01:13:58.076
You certainly had my vote.

01:13:59.743 --> 01:14:01.910
Plus, that knee's a goldmine.

01:14:04.076 --> 01:14:07.743
No, I mean, a limp goes
a long way in politics.

01:14:10.576 --> 01:14:12.242
Look at Roosevelt.

01:14:30.451 --> 01:14:33.284
Pull out the red carpet!
Get the flowers out!

01:14:33.409 --> 01:14:36.785
Get all the flowers out!
Here she comes. Come here.

01:14:46.117 --> 01:14:47.743
I gotta go see the chief.
I gotta go see the chief.

01:14:47.785 --> 01:14:49.618
Why? I don't know. I don't know.

01:14:49.743 --> 01:14:51.909
Is it bad news?
Think it'll be bad news?

01:14:55.159 --> 01:14:57.785
Say hi to the chief for me.

01:14:57.909 --> 01:15:00.701
Gonna be goin' back down up there.
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:15:00.785 --> 01:15:04.242
Stay off your knee. Don't
mess your hair up, pretty boy.

01:15:11.825 --> 01:15:14.159
<i>Got a call today
from DA Killcullen.</i>

01:15:15.493 --> 01:15:17.159
Close the door.

01:15:20.576 --> 01:15:23.368
The state internal investigation
into the shooting of Luke Glanton

01:15:23.451 --> 01:15:25.660
has been deemed lawful.

01:15:25.743 --> 01:15:27.326
Congratulations, Officer.

01:15:27.409 --> 01:15:30.618
You can put it behind you,
get back to police work.

01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:33.992
The question is, can you go back
out on patrol anytime soon,

01:15:34.076 --> 01:15:36.493
and if you could,
can you be effective?

01:15:37.409 --> 01:15:40.451
I don't think that I can.
That's okay.

01:15:40.534 --> 01:15:43.326
You know what? There's a lot
of jobs to be done around here

01:15:43.409 --> 01:15:44.784
that, in ways,
and you know that,

01:15:44.909 --> 01:15:46.159
in ways,
are much more important

01:15:46.242 --> 01:15:47.493
than what happens
out on the street.

01:15:47.576 --> 01:15:50.242
I'm so glad you said that because,
Chief, I've thought a lot about this

01:15:50.326 --> 01:15:55.825
and I think that I could be
best utilized as a lieutenant

01:15:55.909 --> 01:15:58.326
in charge of
special investigations.

01:15:58.409 --> 01:16:00.534
There's a lot of restructuring
within the division

01:16:00.618 --> 01:16:01.856
that I've actually
formulated...

01:16:01.909 --> 01:16:03.784
I can't fucking do that.

01:16:03.867 --> 01:16:06.909
Well, yeah, of course
you could. I mean...

01:16:08.159 --> 01:16:09.368
Cross! Come on.

01:16:09.451 --> 01:16:11.825
You paid too much for your
education to act so stupid, kid.

01:16:11.909 --> 01:16:14.201
Well, I think it's the very fact that
I do have an education like this

01:16:14.284 --> 01:16:15.784
that perhaps is the reason
why I've thought about

01:16:15.867 --> 01:16:18.576
how restructuring the unit,
the division,

01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:19.898
can actually benefit you, me...

01:16:19.909 --> 01:16:22.992
Cross, I appreciate
your ambition, I really do.

01:16:23.076 --> 01:16:26.159
And I think... You know, I think
you're gonna be a great cop.

01:16:26.242 --> 01:16:28.159
You are a great cop.
You're a hero.

01:16:28.242 --> 01:16:31.867
But at this point, right now, you
gotta get back to real life,

01:16:31.992 --> 01:16:34.493
and in real life, you got two choices.
Which are?

01:16:34.576 --> 01:16:37.117
You can retire on disability...

01:16:37.201 --> 01:16:38.867
I don't wanna do that.
All right, good.

01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:40.076
I don't want you
to do that either.

01:16:40.159 --> 01:16:43.493
Or you could be reassigned
at your current rank.

01:16:45.242 --> 01:16:48.909
<i>That's it. You gotta
work your way up, man.</i>

01:16:54.409 --> 01:16:56.326
Hey, man,
heard you were down here.

01:16:56.409 --> 01:16:57.825
Hey.

01:16:57.909 --> 01:16:59.534
What are you doing?

01:17:01.451 --> 01:17:04.909
What are you doing in plain clothes?
You didn't hear? I made Vice.

01:17:05.409 --> 01:17:07.159
Get the fuck outta here.

01:17:07.242 --> 01:17:09.493
Yeah, man, I'm actually
paired up with Deluca.

01:17:10.242 --> 01:17:11.992
That's good.
What do you got for me?

01:17:12.076 --> 01:17:15.409
Oh, yeah, couple mutts left this
in the back seat of their car.

01:17:15.493 --> 01:17:17.409
A leaky substance.
All right.

01:17:18.076 --> 01:17:20.617
So when are we gonna get
together, grab a little bite,

01:17:20.992 --> 01:17:22.368
you know,
talk about some things?

01:17:22.451 --> 01:17:24.617
Sounds great.
All right, man. Page me.

01:17:24.742 --> 01:17:26.117
Okay.
Thanks.

01:17:28.034 --> 01:17:30.451
What I'm about
to ask you is very sensitive.

01:17:30.534 --> 01:17:33.076
The only reason why I'm asking
is 'cause you're my friend.

01:17:33.159 --> 01:17:34.519
I don't know what
I can do to help,

01:17:34.534 --> 01:17:36.576
but, yeah, what do you need?
All right. Right on.

01:17:36.659 --> 01:17:39.326
Deluca and I have been working
on this case, all right?

01:17:39.409 --> 01:17:42.825
And I want you to
keep this to yourself.

01:17:42.909 --> 01:17:44.493
It's a little private.

01:17:44.576 --> 01:17:48.659
And I don't want anybody
to know about it, okay?

01:17:48.742 --> 01:17:50.034
Okay.

01:17:50.117 --> 01:17:52.992
Okay, Deluca and I are working
with this fucking hooker.

01:17:53.076 --> 01:17:55.284
We gotta fucking head
her off with some coke.

01:17:55.784 --> 01:17:58.409
So Deluca and I thought
that, you know, if...

01:17:58.867 --> 01:18:00.950
We need some temporary
access to the evidence room.

01:18:01.034 --> 01:18:02.154
We need you to get some shit.

01:18:02.159 --> 01:18:04.617
We gotta hit this bitch off.
That's what we need.

01:18:05.242 --> 01:18:08.242
I really tried to look out for
you with that seven grand.

01:18:08.326 --> 01:18:10.617
Now I need you to
look out for me.

01:18:11.409 --> 01:18:14.284
I'm serious, bro.
This is how it works.

01:20:04.575 --> 01:20:08.159
Hey.
Hey, don't worry, it's okay.

01:20:11.159 --> 01:20:13.034
I didn't mean to startle you.

01:20:13.117 --> 01:20:17.201
It's okay. I just wanna
give you something. All right?

01:20:17.284 --> 01:20:20.284
Listen, this is the money that we
recovered from your house, okay?

01:20:20.367 --> 01:20:21.784
I want you to have it.

01:20:21.867 --> 01:20:23.742
I don't know what that is.

01:20:24.825 --> 01:20:26.117
You don't have to
ever even see me again,

01:20:26.201 --> 01:20:27.992
just take the money.

01:20:28.076 --> 01:20:31.076
I'm not here as a police officer,
I'm here as a regular guy.

01:20:31.201 --> 01:20:33.825
Listen, listen, listen. Listen to me.
Get the fuck away.

01:20:33.909 --> 01:20:36.659
You fucked up my son's life,

01:20:36.742 --> 01:20:38.201
therefore you
fucked up my life!

01:20:38.284 --> 01:20:40.367
Get the fuck away from me.

01:20:54.325 --> 01:20:57.575
I should have brought this
to you sooner, and I apologize.

01:20:57.659 --> 01:21:01.034
This was recovered
from a house during a search.

01:21:01.117 --> 01:21:02.659
No, wait a minute, Cross.

01:21:02.742 --> 01:21:05.742
It's just a small fraction
of what's going on.

01:21:06.659 --> 01:21:08.450
Wait a minute, Cross.

01:21:09.992 --> 01:21:11.784
Don't say another word.

01:21:11.909 --> 01:21:14.575
What do you mean? No, no, no,
don't say another word.

01:21:22.241 --> 01:21:25.159
What do you expect
me to do with this?

01:21:25.241 --> 01:21:26.909
You're joking, right?
This is shit.

01:21:26.992 --> 01:21:28.034
Chief.

01:21:28.117 --> 01:21:32.325
This ain't my problem, all right?
This is your problem.

01:21:32.408 --> 01:21:34.825
This is our problem of the
fucking police department,

01:21:34.909 --> 01:21:36.492
and I'm bringing it
to your attention

01:21:36.575 --> 01:21:38.325
because that's what
I should fucking do!

01:21:38.408 --> 01:21:40.159
Oh, yeah, is that right?
Yeah!

01:21:40.241 --> 01:21:41.992
Is that what you should do?

01:21:42.076 --> 01:21:43.659
Rat out other fucking cops?
Chief...

01:21:43.742 --> 01:21:45.992
This is un-fucking-believable,
all right?

01:21:46.076 --> 01:21:48.076
Get this shit out of here!

01:23:13.241 --> 01:23:14.617
Fuck.

01:23:26.784 --> 01:23:28.325
Fuck.

01:23:33.742 --> 01:23:35.241
Hey.

01:23:41.825 --> 01:23:43.408
Where you going?

01:23:47.909 --> 01:23:49.492
I was going home.

01:23:52.492 --> 01:23:57.241
You know that thing you and
Scotty been talking about?

01:24:01.075 --> 01:24:02.450
Yeah.

01:24:03.909 --> 01:24:05.408
Sure.

01:24:05.492 --> 01:24:07.909
Well, you and I
have to talk about it.

01:24:09.742 --> 01:24:11.241
Follow me.

01:25:13.408 --> 01:25:15.241
What the fuck?

01:25:19.075 --> 01:25:20.241
Fucking...

01:25:45.116 --> 01:25:46.533
Oh, fuck.

01:26:02.408 --> 01:26:03.784
Hey!

01:26:32.575 --> 01:26:34.241
Hey, Pop.

01:26:37.408 --> 01:26:38.824
Avery.

01:26:45.241 --> 01:26:47.241
There's a way out of this.

01:26:49.741 --> 01:26:51.741
You're not gonna like it.

01:26:53.991 --> 01:26:55.575
You wanna hear?

01:27:01.741 --> 01:27:03.824
Yeah, I wanna hear it.

01:27:05.241 --> 01:27:07.241
Let's start with the precinct.

01:27:07.325 --> 01:27:09.450
Anybody there still trust you?

01:27:10.450 --> 01:27:11.908
Scott.

01:27:13.075 --> 01:27:14.783
We'll start with Scott.

01:27:23.450 --> 01:27:25.116
Playing shortstop.

01:27:26.075 --> 01:27:28.741
Looks good. He's getting bigger.
Jesus Christ.

01:27:30.575 --> 01:27:32.866
You really gave
Deluca quite a scare.

01:27:32.949 --> 01:27:35.283
He's ready to dump you,
the whole thing.

01:27:35.367 --> 01:27:36.824
Enough with these
fucking tests, all right?

01:27:36.908 --> 01:27:39.200
Either ask me to help you or
just leave me the fuck alone.

01:27:43.158 --> 01:27:44.437
I need you to go
into the locker,

01:27:44.492 --> 01:27:45.908
I need you to take
the McKillen case out.

01:27:45.991 --> 01:27:49.075
It's a kilo, it's a big brick, it
says "McKillen" across it, okay?

01:27:49.158 --> 01:27:51.635
I need you to break off a chunk,
I need you to put it in a bag.

01:27:51.658 --> 01:27:53.658
I'm gonna come by, I'm gonna
pick it up tomorrow morning.

01:27:53.741 --> 01:27:55.699
If somebody asks you,
"Hey, why is this lighter?"

01:27:55.783 --> 01:27:56.824
You say,
"Hey, you know what?"

01:27:56.908 --> 01:27:58.658
"I'm a rookie.
I made a mistake."

01:27:58.741 --> 01:28:01.241
You're a squeaky-clean fucking
lawyer with a medal of honor.

01:28:01.325 --> 01:28:03.616
Nobody's gonna
question you, okay?

01:28:04.783 --> 01:28:08.075
You gotta do this for me.
I'm in a jam with these guys.

01:28:09.908 --> 01:28:11.283
No problem.

01:28:13.116 --> 01:28:15.241
I knew I could
count on you, man.

01:28:15.824 --> 01:28:17.283
Yeah.

01:28:18.241 --> 01:28:19.991
Tell Mike I love him.
I gotta go.

01:28:20.075 --> 01:28:21.408
All right.

01:28:25.033 --> 01:28:26.312
<i>I need you

01:28:26.325 --> 01:28:27.824

01:28:27.908 --> 01:28:30.908
<i>It's a kilo, it's a big brick, it

01:28:30.991 --> 01:28:33.469

01:28:33.492 --> 01:28:35.824

pick it up tomorrow morning.</i>

01:28:35.908 --> 01:28:36.991
<i>All right?</i>

01:28:37.075 --> 01:28:38.658
<i>If somebody asks you,
"Hey, why is this lighter?"</i>

01:28:38.741 --> 01:28:39.699
<i>You say,
"Hey, you know what?"</i>

01:28:39.783 --> 01:28:42.367
<i>"I'm a rookie.
I made a mistake."</i>

01:28:42.450 --> 01:28:44.908
<i>You're a squeaky-clean fucking
lawyer with a medal of honor.</i>

01:28:44.991 --> 01:28:46.908

01:28:48.033 --> 01:28:51.532
<i>You gotta do this for me.

01:28:52.241 --> 01:28:53.699
<i>No problem.</i>

01:28:58.991 --> 01:29:00.908
You shown this to IA?

01:29:01.325 --> 01:29:02.949
'Course not.

01:29:03.033 --> 01:29:05.075
Handing it to you
on a silver platter.

01:29:08.908 --> 01:29:10.741
Got any idea what this means?

01:29:11.450 --> 01:29:13.408
Are you ready to do it?

01:29:13.908 --> 01:29:16.532
Are you, son?
Are you really ready?

01:29:16.616 --> 01:29:19.283
'Cause they're gonna
fuckin' tear you in half.

01:29:20.075 --> 01:29:23.241
I'm gonna need your assurance you're
gonna follow through with it.

01:29:24.741 --> 01:29:26.200
Really?

01:29:27.616 --> 01:29:30.574
And I'm gonna want full
immunity when you do.

01:29:31.075 --> 01:29:32.593
You can't just walk
in here and tell me

01:29:32.658 --> 01:29:34.241
what the fuck to do.
You understand?

01:29:34.325 --> 01:29:35.991
And when you do,

01:29:36.574 --> 01:29:38.158
I wanna be made
Assistant District Attorney.

01:29:38.241 --> 01:29:40.741
I have a law degree
and I passed the bar.

01:29:41.783 --> 01:29:44.449
I don't have a spot for you right now.
Make a spot.

01:29:44.949 --> 01:29:46.033
I won't do that.

01:29:46.116 --> 01:29:48.283
I can't just snap my fingers
and make you Assistant DA.

01:29:48.367 --> 01:29:49.491
You can say no.

01:29:49.574 --> 01:29:51.325
You can say no,
I'll walk out this door,

01:29:51.408 --> 01:29:52.658
<i>I'll walk over to the Gazette,</i>

01:29:52.741 --> 01:29:54.866
I'll tell 'em everything I know,
including this conversation.

01:29:54.949 --> 01:29:56.947
Listen, you're not going anywhere.
Don't... Listen.

01:29:57.408 --> 01:30:00.075
Put it back on the table,
I'll fucking do it.

01:30:02.741 --> 01:30:04.241
All three things?

01:30:04.325 --> 01:30:05.908
All right.

01:30:06.616 --> 01:30:09.325
I'm not gonna promise you how
long you're gonna stay there.

01:30:09.407 --> 01:30:12.075
You're not gonna shake
my fucking hand, pal.

01:30:13.574 --> 01:30:16.699
I'll make you Assistant DA. I'm never
gonna shake your fucking hand.

01:30:19.075 --> 01:30:21.574
You're too smart
for your own good.

01:30:22.866 --> 01:30:24.283
Come down, come here.

01:30:24.367 --> 01:30:26.241
Get right in there
for a good shot.

01:30:26.949 --> 01:30:29.491
Detective, how do you respond
to these allegations?

01:30:33.658 --> 01:30:35.491
<i>Drugs, corruption and gangs.</i>

01:30:35.574 --> 01:30:38.824
<i>It's not an investigation by the
Schenectady Police Department,</i>

01:30:38.908 --> 01:30:42.824
<i>it's an investigation into the
Schenectady Police Department.</i>

01:30:42.908 --> 01:30:44.741
<i>Earlier today,
DA William Killcullen</i>

01:30:44.824 --> 01:30:46.200
<i>announced that his office,</i>

01:30:46.283 --> 01:30:47.824
<i>along with the FBI,</i>

01:30:47.908 --> 01:30:49.449
<i>would be handing
down indictments</i>

01:30:49.574 --> 01:30:52.783
<i>that would lead to the arrest of
these Schenectady police officers.</i>

01:30:52.866 --> 01:30:55.824
<i>The DA is making allegations
today that the Vice officers</i>

01:30:55.908 --> 01:30:59.116
<i>were acting like the gangs that
they were supposed to be busting.</i>

01:30:59.491 --> 01:31:02.200
<i>Officers allegedly
stole drugs and money,</i>

01:31:02.283 --> 01:31:05.241
<i>even guns from inside
the evidence room here.</i>

01:31:05.908 --> 01:31:07.991
<i>Officials say that,
with that stolen evidence,</i>

01:31:08.075 --> 01:31:11.491
<i>the cops paid criminals
to help set up their rivals,</i>

01:31:11.574 --> 01:31:15.200
<i>which then led to those
headline-grabbing arrests.</i>

01:31:15.283 --> 01:31:17.949
<i>The DA announced its star
witness in the case today,</i>

01:31:18.033 --> 01:31:19.741
<i>hero cop Avery Cross,</i>

01:31:19.824 --> 01:31:22.616
<i>who, less than a year ago,
was shot in the line of duty</i>

01:31:22.699 --> 01:31:25.075
<i>while trying to save
two Schenectady residents</i>

01:31:25.158 --> 01:31:26.991
<i>from the alleged Moto Bandit.</i>

01:31:27.075 --> 01:31:29.282
<i>In Schenectady, I'm Jessica
Layton, News Channel 13.</i>

01:31:29.407 --> 01:31:30.908
<i>- It's gonna be all right.
- Thanks, Jess.</i>

01:31:30.991 --> 01:31:34.116
<i>It's the largest case of fraud
this region has seen...</i>

01:32:24.075 --> 01:32:25.574
<i>You know, when I was a kid,</i>

01:32:25.699 --> 01:32:28.741
<i>I used to look at my dad
dressed in judge's robes</i>

01:32:28.866 --> 01:32:32.366
<i>and I used to think that
my father was a superhero.</i>

01:32:33.699 --> 01:32:35.366
<i>And I don't think
I was far off.</i>

01:32:36.574 --> 01:32:38.866
He had that quality
that judges have

01:32:38.949 --> 01:32:42.075
where they have
tremendous compassion,

01:32:42.199 --> 01:32:45.366
but they're also
ferocious at the same time.

01:32:45.449 --> 01:32:47.449
He wasn't afraid
of making enemies.

01:32:47.532 --> 01:32:50.991
I think that's probably
why he had so many friends.

01:32:51.075 --> 01:32:53.366
I had the chance, right before he
fell into the coma, to tell him

01:32:53.449 --> 01:32:56.824
that I was dedicating my run
for Attorney General to him.

01:32:56.908 --> 01:32:58.908
And...

01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:03.574
He shook his head, "No,"
and I didn't understand why.

01:33:05.532 --> 01:33:07.991
So I leaned in close, and...
He could whisper.

01:33:08.075 --> 01:33:09.949
And he said to me,

01:33:10.033 --> 01:33:12.449
"I'll take the win, not the
run."

01:33:15.699 --> 01:33:17.908
That was my dad, that was AI.

01:33:23.741 --> 01:33:25.741
Son, you wanna come with me?
Sure.

01:33:35.866 --> 01:33:37.157
Avery?
Yeah.

01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:38.783
Can I talk to you for a minute?

01:33:38.866 --> 01:33:40.282
Sure.

01:33:41.532 --> 01:33:43.115
Close the door.

01:33:46.741 --> 01:33:48.157
What's wrong?

01:33:48.449 --> 01:33:50.824
We have to talk about AJ.

01:33:51.407 --> 01:33:52.824
He wants to come
and live with you.

01:33:52.908 --> 01:33:55.324
He won't stop
asking me about it.

01:33:57.074 --> 01:33:58.491
Really?

01:34:00.074 --> 01:34:04.407
I guess that's
a good idea at some point.

01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:07.658
I think he needs you. I think, if
he doesn't come and live with you,

01:34:07.741 --> 01:34:10.574
he's gonna completely
go off the rails.

01:34:11.741 --> 01:34:13.157
It's just right now, you know,

01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:16.240
with the campaign and everything,
it's just not an ideal time.

01:34:16.366 --> 01:34:19.032
I mean, what am I gonna do with him?
I don't know what he likes.

01:34:20.699 --> 01:34:22.949
I just don't think it would
be good for him or anybody.

01:34:23.866 --> 01:34:26.199
I mean, come on, you know that.
Okay.

01:34:26.282 --> 01:34:28.407
No, well,
you can tell him that.

01:34:29.157 --> 01:34:30.990
Jennifer... What am I
supposed to tell him?

01:34:31.074 --> 01:34:34.115
I just don't... Why are
you doing this right now?

01:34:35.741 --> 01:34:37.240
You can tell him now.

01:34:38.574 --> 01:34:40.949
Tomorrow we're gonna
head to Buffalo in the morning.

01:34:41.032 --> 01:34:42.658
Wednesday is outer boroughs
in New York City,

01:34:42.741 --> 01:34:43.908
and then the
AI Smith dinner at night.

01:34:43.990 --> 01:34:45.869
Do we have time to get there?
We do, absolutely.

01:34:45.908 --> 01:34:47.866
We'll have our last event
close in Queens,

01:34:47.949 --> 01:34:48.949
we'll hit the Upper West Side

01:34:49.032 --> 01:34:50.199
and then we have to
be at the Waldorf.

01:34:50.282 --> 01:34:52.324
How about Yusef, the driver we had for my dad?
Can we get Yusef?

01:34:52.407 --> 01:34:53.783
Yeah, totally.
What's going on in Queens?

01:34:53.866 --> 01:34:55.532
In Queens,
he's gonna do an event

01:34:55.616 --> 01:34:57.574
on environmental issues.
Yeah.

01:34:57.658 --> 01:35:00.074
Talking about some of the...
Protecting the Sound,

01:35:00.157 --> 01:35:01.990
and some of
the environmental stuff.

01:35:02.074 --> 01:35:04.324
And then Thursday
head to Rochester for lunch.

01:35:04.407 --> 01:35:05.658
You're gonna go to a place

01:35:05.741 --> 01:35:07.616
where you're gonna order something
called the Garbage Plate.

01:35:07.699 --> 01:35:09.990
Just want you to be prepared for it.
That's the picture.

01:35:10.074 --> 01:35:11.199
We're gonna do that...
Did you see?

01:35:11.282 --> 01:35:12.532
Yeah, no, I've seen it.

01:35:12.616 --> 01:35:14.282
And then Sunday morning,
black churches.

01:35:14.366 --> 01:35:15.783
Oh, perfect.

01:35:23.407 --> 01:35:24.948
<i>Avery Cross?</i>

01:35:25.032 --> 01:35:27.157
<i>Yeah. AJ.</i>

01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:29.115
<i>AJ? Hi, AJ.
Yeah.</i>

01:35:30.032 --> 01:35:31.616
So what high school
are you coming from?

01:35:31.699 --> 01:35:33.658
Troy High School. Yeah.
You're coming from Troy? Okay.

01:35:33.741 --> 01:35:36.658
So not too far away. What
brings you to Schenectady?

01:35:36.741 --> 01:35:38.407
Uh, my dad wanted me here.

01:35:38.491 --> 01:35:39.532
Your dad wanted you here?

01:35:39.616 --> 01:35:42.491
Yeah, for my senior year,
he wanted me to move here.

01:35:42.574 --> 01:35:45.032
What about you? Did you wanna
come here for your senior year?

01:35:45.115 --> 01:35:47.282
I don't know. Yeah. I...

01:35:48.407 --> 01:35:50.491
I guess not, not really.

01:35:50.574 --> 01:35:52.074
Do you know anybody here?

01:35:52.157 --> 01:35:53.449
At the high school?
No.

01:35:53.532 --> 01:35:54.699
No. Don't know anybody?

01:36:20.741 --> 01:36:23.115
Just...
Just peek over your shoulder.

01:36:23.199 --> 01:36:25.240
Peek over your
fucking shoulder.

01:36:25.324 --> 01:36:28.658
There. Hello. Hello. Hello.

01:36:33.407 --> 01:36:34.823
You don't like them girls?

01:36:37.115 --> 01:36:38.699
I don't know,
maybe you're just used to it.

01:36:38.783 --> 01:36:42.032
They ain't got girls like that
where I come from. You feel me?

01:36:42.115 --> 01:36:43.616
Where are you from?

01:36:43.699 --> 01:36:45.115
Troy.

01:36:45.907 --> 01:36:48.449
Troy?
Yeah, you heard of Troy?

01:36:48.532 --> 01:36:50.823
Yeah, I've heard of Troy.
Where's Troy at?

01:36:50.907 --> 01:36:52.532
It's fucking
right next door, dude.

01:36:52.616 --> 01:36:54.032
Right next door?

01:36:54.115 --> 01:36:56.240
I would've guessed
you were from Long Island.

01:36:56.782 --> 01:36:58.324
Where's that?

01:37:01.699 --> 01:37:04.032
It's where people
that talk like you come from.

01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:08.199
B, I'm bored as a motherfucker
around here, dude.

01:37:08.282 --> 01:37:09.948
I've been here for, like,
fucking three days,

01:37:10.032 --> 01:37:11.782
I'm bored out of
my fucking mind.

01:37:11.865 --> 01:37:13.658
Welcome to Schenectady.

01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:16.491
What do you dudes
do for fun, nothing?

01:37:16.574 --> 01:37:18.990
This is it? This is
what I got, for a year?

01:37:19.074 --> 01:37:20.199
No, we got some things.

01:37:20.282 --> 01:37:21.740
What?

01:37:22.491 --> 01:37:23.865
Don't say, like, a mall.

01:37:23.948 --> 01:37:27.282
If you say a fucking mall, B,
like, I swear to God...

01:37:30.990 --> 01:37:32.616
What do you do?

01:37:32.699 --> 01:37:34.282
I get high.

01:37:36.658 --> 01:37:38.532
We do some of that around here.

01:37:38.616 --> 01:37:41.366
I could tell you smoked.
I seen you from back there.

01:37:41.449 --> 01:37:45.240
You one of them loner...
Loner-stoners is what I call 'em, right?

01:37:45.324 --> 01:37:46.574
You like to get high and, like,

01:37:46.658 --> 01:37:49.407
chill in your room
and draw and shit.

01:37:52.032 --> 01:37:54.115
So what you trying to do with
the rest of this day, then?

01:37:54.199 --> 01:37:55.907
You trying to go to math class?

01:37:57.157 --> 01:37:58.782
You wanna go get high?

01:38:03.115 --> 01:38:05.032
Let's go.
All right, let's go.

01:38:12.990 --> 01:38:15.532
You know what this remind me of?
The Goonies.

01:38:15.616 --> 01:38:18.574
You know that movie? Where
they're, like, all in a cave?

01:38:20.074 --> 01:38:22.282
You want a cigarette,
just ask, don't worry.

01:38:23.324 --> 01:38:24.907
I'll take a cigarette.

01:38:25.407 --> 01:38:28.324
I like smoking cigarettes
when I'm high.

01:38:28.698 --> 01:38:30.657
You like smoking
when you're smoking?

01:38:33.698 --> 01:38:37.115
You smoke menthols, man?
Like a breath of fresh air.

01:38:37.199 --> 01:38:39.990
Like a breath of fresh air.
But you don't care.

01:38:40.074 --> 01:38:44.532
You got the smoke puff
blowing everywhere, I swear.

01:38:44.615 --> 01:38:47.740
Yo, here we go,
I said my spit is my MO.

01:38:47.823 --> 01:38:50.532
My mouth is my gun, I shoot
up your whole squadron

01:38:50.615 --> 01:38:53.449
with one flip of my tongue.
And you done.

01:38:53.532 --> 01:38:55.074
When did you write that?

01:38:55.157 --> 01:38:57.449
No, I'm not trying to lie.
I wrote that.

01:38:59.740 --> 01:39:01.657
<i>Fucking quiet around here.</i>

01:39:02.032 --> 01:39:03.511
<i>Shit, though, when I was a kid,</i>

01:39:03.532 --> 01:39:05.573
<i>there were always kids
playing here, you know?</i>

01:39:05.657 --> 01:39:07.948
<i>Oh, you came here
when you was a kid?</i>

01:39:08.032 --> 01:39:10.740
<i>Yeah, man, I'd come
here with my parents sometimes.</i>

01:39:11.782 --> 01:39:13.990
<i>Are your parents
still together?</i>

01:39:14.074 --> 01:39:15.573
Yeah.

01:39:16.199 --> 01:39:19.449
That's cool,
they're still together.

01:39:19.532 --> 01:39:21.240
Yeah, it's all right.

01:39:22.074 --> 01:39:23.948
It's not my real dad, though.

01:39:24.782 --> 01:39:26.823
Where's your real dad at?

01:39:28.366 --> 01:39:32.907
Oh, he died, actually, like in
a car accident or something.

01:39:33.324 --> 01:39:34.782
Shit.

01:39:37.282 --> 01:39:39.449
Yeah, this is kind bud, dude.

01:39:40.573 --> 01:39:43.324
But you know where
I could score some X?

01:39:49.740 --> 01:39:50.823
Yeah.

01:39:51.865 --> 01:39:53.282
For tonight?

01:39:53.366 --> 01:39:55.615
Well, we just did our
downer, we gotta get up.

01:40:03.531 --> 01:40:05.573
Remember, come back
by yourself. All right?

01:40:05.657 --> 01:40:07.115
Yeah, man, you got it.

01:40:13.490 --> 01:40:14.531
All right.

01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:17.032
Let's go.

01:40:20.531 --> 01:40:22.448
Let me see it.
What?

01:40:22.531 --> 01:40:25.865
Let me see the fucking drugs.
You fucking crazy, man?

01:40:27.074 --> 01:40:29.157
Let me see my fucking drugs.

01:40:32.698 --> 01:40:34.282
Fucking nuts, man.

01:40:35.115 --> 01:40:37.865
What the fuck?
I gave you $500.

01:40:37.948 --> 01:40:39.366
Yeah, that's 20 hits.

01:40:39.448 --> 01:40:41.240
Yo, that's inflation
in Scheneck, right?

01:40:45.865 --> 01:40:47.990
Oh, yo, what the fuck, son?

01:40:48.074 --> 01:40:51.282
Dead ass, the fucking 5-0.
Don't worry about it, man.

01:40:51.782 --> 01:40:54.199
Oh, fuck! Fuck!
Police.

01:40:54.282 --> 01:40:56.324
Let me see your hands.
Police! Get on the ground!

01:40:56.448 --> 01:40:59.115
Get on the ground! Get on the ground!
All right! Fuck!

01:40:59.199 --> 01:41:01.573
Interlace your fingers.

01:41:07.782 --> 01:41:10.907
<i>He was buying
ecstasy from a Schenectady kid.</i>

01:41:11.032 --> 01:41:12.324
And who arrested him?

01:41:12.406 --> 01:41:15.115
A couple of beat cops.
McCracken and Potter.

01:41:15.199 --> 01:41:16.865
You know these guys?
Mmm-hmm.

01:41:16.948 --> 01:41:19.199
They'll sit on it
if I ask them to.

01:41:20.657 --> 01:41:22.074
Did anybody
else see him come in?

01:41:22.157 --> 01:41:24.324
No. I made sure of that.

01:41:30.573 --> 01:41:32.907
Did you get any
sense that he knew this kid or...

01:41:32.990 --> 01:41:34.698
Yeah, friends.

01:41:34.823 --> 01:41:37.062
- Just the two of 'em?
- Yeah.

01:41:37.115 --> 01:41:38.531
Okay.

01:41:38.615 --> 01:41:40.323
What's this other kid's name?

01:41:40.406 --> 01:41:43.907
Jason Kancam. Got busted a few
years ago for shoplifting.

01:41:43.990 --> 01:41:46.199
- What's his name?
- Jason Kancam.

01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:49.782
An aimless youth.

01:41:56.657 --> 01:41:58.323
Gordon, can we kill
the mic on Room 3?

01:41:58.406 --> 01:41:59.907
Yeah.

01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:11.948
Dad, I fucked up. I know...

01:42:12.990 --> 01:42:15.448
And I know you don't have time to
deal with this stuff right now.

01:42:15.531 --> 01:42:16.948
Not him, okay?

01:42:17.990 --> 01:42:20.657
What? I want you to
leave him alone.

01:42:21.907 --> 01:42:23.448
All right?

01:42:24.406 --> 01:42:26.115
Okay?
Why?

01:42:27.490 --> 01:42:30.573
Wipe that fucking smirk off your face!
You hear me?

01:42:31.907 --> 01:42:33.823
I want you to leave that
fucking kid alone, all right?

01:42:33.907 --> 01:42:36.199
Look at me. Look at me.

01:42:36.990 --> 01:42:38.990
You wanted to come
live with me, right?

01:42:42.239 --> 01:42:46.157
You think this is easy for me,
during this time, huh?

01:42:47.323 --> 01:42:51.239
I'm trying to make this work.
I'm doing it for you.

01:42:52.365 --> 01:42:54.032
You can have anything you want,

01:42:54.115 --> 01:42:56.157
but I don't want you
to touch that kid.

01:42:56.948 --> 01:43:00.074
You leave him alone.
Do you under-fucking-stand me?

01:43:00.157 --> 01:43:02.323
Say yes.
Yes.

01:43:03.657 --> 01:43:06.448
Look at me and say yes.
Yes.

01:43:25.531 --> 01:43:27.365
<i>Can you state
your name for the record?</i>

01:43:27.448 --> 01:43:28.907
<i>Jason Kancam.</i>

01:43:28.990 --> 01:43:31.657
<i>Jason, how old are you?
Seventeen.</i>

01:43:32.074 --> 01:43:33.698
Are your parents here today?

01:43:34.657 --> 01:43:35.865
Yes. Yes.

01:43:35.948 --> 01:43:37.406
Can you come up, please?

01:43:43.948 --> 01:43:45.448
You're Jason's parents?
Yes.

01:43:45.531 --> 01:43:47.239
Jason, you've been charged
with criminal possession

01:43:47.323 --> 01:43:49.365
of a controlled substance
in the third degree.

01:43:49.448 --> 01:43:51.365
Counselor, do you waive a
formal reading of the charges?

01:43:51.448 --> 01:43:52.448
Yes, please, Your Honor.

01:43:52.531 --> 01:43:53.531
In regards
to my client's status,

01:43:53.615 --> 01:43:55.323
there has been a discussion
with the District Attorney.

01:43:55.406 --> 01:43:57.740
Your Honor, I may be able to have
this case potentially resolved today.

01:43:57.823 --> 01:43:59.990
So I'd ask that the court
put it on for second call.

01:44:00.074 --> 01:44:01.114
Second call.

01:44:01.198 --> 01:44:02.448
This is a C felony,

01:44:02.531 --> 01:44:05.573
so Jason could do anywhere
between five and 15 years.

01:44:05.657 --> 01:44:08.114
But I'm getting the impression
from the prosecutor

01:44:08.198 --> 01:44:10.990
that they may be willing to
reduce it today to a misdemeanor.

01:44:11.074 --> 01:44:14.698
The offer on his particular
case would be time served,

01:44:14.782 --> 01:44:16.101
which is the day
he spent in jail,

01:44:16.114 --> 01:44:17.823
and a fine,
and that would be it.

01:44:17.948 --> 01:44:20.032
Can he come home with us today?
He can.

01:44:20.114 --> 01:44:22.393
Guess it's your lucky day.
Somebody's looking out for you.

01:44:52.239 --> 01:44:55.406
Look, I didn't mean to get you
busted the other night, all right?

01:44:58.073 --> 01:44:59.573
I'm sorry.

01:45:00.073 --> 01:45:02.531
Yeah, it was a pretty
shitty fucking night.

01:45:03.657 --> 01:45:05.490
But don't worry about it.

01:45:06.615 --> 01:45:09.073
I was out of there
in five fucking minutes, dude.

01:45:10.698 --> 01:45:14.156
You think I'm gonna sit there and
get fucked up the ass all night?

01:45:17.156 --> 01:45:20.073
And what happened
when you got home? Huh?

01:45:22.406 --> 01:45:24.239
Went upstairs.

01:45:25.406 --> 01:45:28.573
Tried to go to sleep, but I was
still trippin' like a mo'fucker.

01:45:29.989 --> 01:45:32.531
Why, what happened to you
when you got home?

01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:36.281
I'm cool, man.

01:45:36.365 --> 01:45:38.782
Your moms was all
worried and shit?

01:45:39.365 --> 01:45:40.989
Oh, man, my mom's...

01:45:43.865 --> 01:45:45.281
I'm cool, man.

01:45:45.615 --> 01:45:47.073
Really?

01:45:48.406 --> 01:45:50.490
'Cause I saw that guy today.

01:45:52.531 --> 01:45:53.947
What guy?

01:45:54.531 --> 01:45:55.947
Your dad.

01:45:57.698 --> 01:45:59.615
That's your fucking dad.

01:46:01.073 --> 01:46:02.490
When did he move in?

01:46:07.323 --> 01:46:09.740
What the fuck you
talking about, AJ?

01:46:10.448 --> 01:46:13.740
Just wanna know. I figured out...
What the fuck's your problem?

01:46:18.114 --> 01:46:19.657
What the fuck's your problem?

01:46:19.740 --> 01:46:22.365
Chill, dude. Chill.
What's your problem, AJ?

01:46:23.573 --> 01:46:25.448
Just fucking around.

01:46:26.906 --> 01:46:28.740
Don't be so serious.

01:46:32.490 --> 01:46:34.573
You got a fucking temper, B.

01:46:34.989 --> 01:46:39.114
You need to watch that shit. It's
gonna get you into fucking trouble.

01:46:42.740 --> 01:46:46.657
How was school, Vanessa? It was okay.
I had trouble with math.

01:46:47.782 --> 01:46:49.864
Hey, what's the deal
with my dad?

01:46:55.073 --> 01:46:56.490
What?

01:47:00.615 --> 01:47:03.156
What, did you like really
hate him or something?

01:47:06.073 --> 01:47:07.698
What was his name?

01:47:08.323 --> 01:47:10.156
I'm not doing this.
What was his first name?

01:47:10.239 --> 01:47:11.782
I'm not doing this.

01:47:19.490 --> 01:47:22.406
How come Mom never
talks to me about my dad?

01:47:23.989 --> 01:47:25.906
I'm your father.

01:47:26.406 --> 01:47:29.573
Search your feelings.
You know it to be true.

01:47:35.365 --> 01:47:38.531
It's her business to talk about
it, not talk about it, you know?

01:47:40.531 --> 01:47:42.698
Grandma used to tell me some.

01:47:43.114 --> 01:47:45.073
Yeah?
What did she used to say?

01:47:45.739 --> 01:47:47.406
She said, like...

01:47:48.864 --> 01:47:51.531
Just that he was,
like, an outlaw.

01:47:52.365 --> 01:47:53.739
You know?

01:47:53.989 --> 01:47:55.947
Sound cool to you?

01:47:57.657 --> 01:47:58.947
I don't know.

01:48:00.239 --> 01:48:03.281
He's not your father.
Not really.

01:48:04.031 --> 01:48:05.864
Just some guy with a baby.

01:48:07.573 --> 01:48:09.198
I'm your father.

01:48:12.406 --> 01:48:15.822
Been there since you were born.
I will always love you.

01:48:16.448 --> 01:48:18.822
Can you at least
tell me his name?

01:49:52.323 --> 01:49:53.781
Hello?

01:50:02.656 --> 01:50:04.073
Yeah?

01:50:06.073 --> 01:50:07.864
I'm looking for Robin.

01:50:08.906 --> 01:50:11.406
Yeah, I'm Robin.
What can I do for you?

01:50:11.906 --> 01:50:13.073
Um...

01:50:13.739 --> 01:50:16.864
I was hoping to talk with
you about Luke Glanton.

01:50:18.490 --> 01:50:19.906
I'm his son.

01:50:24.114 --> 01:50:26.114
You're Luke Glanton's son?

01:50:27.156 --> 01:50:28.739
Yeah.

01:50:32.656 --> 01:50:35.365
Well, come on back, get a beer.

01:50:37.031 --> 01:50:39.448
Bet it's down here in this box,

01:50:41.198 --> 01:50:43.239
if I remember rightly.

01:50:45.906 --> 01:50:47.572
God.

01:50:58.822 --> 01:51:01.989
That guy's your dad.
That's him there.

01:51:02.073 --> 01:51:05.822
And that's the pig there,
the one that bagged him.

01:51:06.906 --> 01:51:08.822
What happened to him?

01:51:08.906 --> 01:51:10.406
Who, the cop?

01:51:10.489 --> 01:51:13.781
Oh, forget about him, man.
Don't... Don't start there.

01:51:14.572 --> 01:51:18.614
I'll show you good things. I'll
show you good things. Come on.

01:51:21.614 --> 01:51:23.489
You are standing
right where your dad

01:51:23.572 --> 01:51:25.405
used to stand
and we used to talk.

01:51:26.822 --> 01:51:28.947
He was a good guy, your dad.

01:51:30.405 --> 01:51:32.864
Oh, wow.
Yeah, those glasses.

01:51:32.947 --> 01:51:34.346
I haven't seen those
in a long time.

01:51:34.405 --> 01:51:37.156
They're his,
those goofy glasses.

01:51:37.239 --> 01:51:38.656
These were his?
Yeah.

01:51:38.739 --> 01:51:41.572
You can keep those. He would've
wanted you to have them.

01:51:42.405 --> 01:51:43.781
Was he good at anything?

01:51:43.864 --> 01:51:47.114
Yeah, he was the best motorcycle
rider I've ever seen in my life.

01:51:47.947 --> 01:51:49.281
The best.
Yeah?

01:51:49.364 --> 01:51:52.822
Best. Never seen
another one like him. Best.

01:51:53.739 --> 01:51:57.073
He was like nothing. Rare.

01:51:58.405 --> 01:52:00.073
Were you guys good friends?

01:52:02.614 --> 01:52:04.405
Yeah, I think we were.

01:52:05.906 --> 01:52:07.697
You still got his bike?

01:52:11.947 --> 01:52:14.281
No, his bike's gone. Yeah.

01:52:16.322 --> 01:52:18.073
Police took it.

01:52:18.864 --> 01:52:20.947
I think they cut it up,
you know.

01:52:22.073 --> 01:52:24.530
They were angry with him.
I know that.

01:52:24.614 --> 01:52:26.073
They were real mad with him.

01:52:27.572 --> 01:52:30.822
I can show you some other things,
too, if you want to see more.

01:52:30.906 --> 01:52:32.322
Yeah?
Yeah.

01:52:37.947 --> 01:52:39.614
Why don't you put
the glasses on?

01:52:40.364 --> 01:52:43.989
For sure, he would've said
they were left there for you.

01:52:44.614 --> 01:52:46.073
No doubt.

01:52:48.739 --> 01:52:51.572
Put 'em on, if you want.
Go on, put 'em on.

01:52:51.656 --> 01:52:53.947
Yeah?
Come on, I'll tell you.

01:52:55.073 --> 01:52:57.405
Yeah. Yeah!

01:52:57.947 --> 01:53:00.364
Yeah?
Yeah. You're calling him back.

01:53:20.947 --> 01:53:23.947
Jason! Jason.

01:53:27.073 --> 01:53:28.739
Let me talk to you.

01:53:29.073 --> 01:53:32.739
Look, man, I wanted to say I'm sorry
about what happened earlier, all right?

01:53:32.822 --> 01:53:34.656
I was a dick.
I won't deny it.

01:53:36.614 --> 01:53:38.989
You lost my money, all right?

01:53:39.073 --> 01:53:40.238
Like, that's...
I think that's all

01:53:40.322 --> 01:53:42.322
I need to really
fucking say, all right?

01:53:42.405 --> 01:53:44.781
But I'm willing to
fucking squash it, okay?

01:53:44.906 --> 01:53:47.280
If you do the squashing,
I'll be the squasher.

01:53:48.405 --> 01:53:50.906
I said I'm sorry, brother.
I meant that shit.

01:53:52.156 --> 01:53:54.489
What you thinking?
Okay.

01:53:54.572 --> 01:53:56.822
You dig?
Okay.

01:53:57.822 --> 01:53:59.447
We good?
All right.

01:54:00.073 --> 01:54:01.739
Dude, dude, yo, listen.

01:54:01.822 --> 01:54:04.697
I'm having a fucking party
at my pop's place tonight.

01:54:04.781 --> 01:54:07.280
Dude, my pop's is fuckin'
off-the-chain, B. Come along.

01:54:07.405 --> 01:54:09.781
I can't do that, man, I'm sorry.
Why?

01:54:09.906 --> 01:54:11.989
Can't make it tonight. You got
family stuff you gotta do?

01:54:12.114 --> 01:54:13.656
No, but I got stuff I gotta do.

01:54:13.739 --> 01:54:15.114
Nah.

01:54:17.572 --> 01:54:18.989
You wanna squash it, right?

01:54:19.906 --> 01:54:22.614
We squashed it, man.
So then come tonight.

01:54:25.447 --> 01:54:26.906
You want me to come
to your party tonight?

01:54:26.947 --> 01:54:28.614
I want you to come to my party.
Is that what you want?

01:54:28.739 --> 01:54:30.489
All right, cool, I'll see you tonight.
All right. Hold up.

01:54:30.572 --> 01:54:32.530
I'll see you tonight.
Another one. Hold up.

01:54:32.614 --> 01:54:34.073
Do me a favor, B.

01:54:34.155 --> 01:54:36.155
Bring some Oxys, all right?
Then we straight.

01:54:36.238 --> 01:54:37.530
No, man.
What you mean, no?

01:54:37.739 --> 01:54:38.864
You gotta make it correct.
I'll see you, man.

01:54:38.947 --> 01:54:40.322
Nah, nah. You're not...
I'll see you, okay?

01:54:40.405 --> 01:54:42.656
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
We ain't seeing shit.

01:54:42.739 --> 01:54:44.530
You coming tonight? Yes.

01:54:44.614 --> 01:54:47.364
You copping my Oxys?
Yes. You got it?

01:54:47.489 --> 01:54:50.364
All right, sounds good. All right,
sounds like a fucking plan.

01:54:51.739 --> 01:54:54.614
It don't gotta be
$500 worth, you know.

01:54:55.489 --> 01:54:58.405
Yo, J!
Keep your head up, bro.

01:55:33.614 --> 01:55:37.155
Same insurance and
everything else with all that stuff?

01:55:37.238 --> 01:55:38.864
- Yes.
- All right.

01:55:38.947 --> 01:55:41.614
All right, I'll get to work
on this for you right away.

01:55:46.489 --> 01:55:47.947
Be right back.

01:56:08.614 --> 01:56:10.155
How'd you make out
with the weather?

01:56:10.238 --> 01:56:12.781
We did all right. A
little water in the basement.

01:56:12.906 --> 01:56:15.572
- Made out pretty good.
- Yeah.

01:56:16.739 --> 01:56:19.030
So much water in
my basement from that flood

01:56:19.113 --> 01:56:22.155
that the whole house
is gonna have mold in it.

01:56:22.238 --> 01:56:25.530
Okay, looks like I've got
everything I need on that.

01:56:25.614 --> 01:56:27.988
Couple more things
I wanna check in here.

01:56:28.614 --> 01:56:30.113
Okay.

01:56:32.946 --> 01:56:34.905
Processed here for you.

01:56:37.946 --> 01:56:40.946
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

01:56:43.405 --> 01:56:45.072
What the fuck are you doing?

01:56:52.072 --> 01:56:53.946
You little motherfucker,
get back here!

01:56:54.072 --> 01:56:55.447
Get fucking...

01:57:29.946 --> 01:57:31.405
You made it.

01:57:40.322 --> 01:57:43.113
Hey, Oxys! Hey!

01:57:47.405 --> 01:57:49.781
All right, I got one fucking question.
One question.

01:57:50.113 --> 01:57:51.322
Ho-ho-ho!

01:57:51.405 --> 01:57:53.322
Who wants some fuckin' Oxys?

01:57:57.946 --> 01:58:01.821
Hello. There we go, there
we go, there we go. Hello.

01:58:05.238 --> 01:58:06.364
Who ain't got 'em?

01:58:06.447 --> 01:58:08.614
Who ain't got 'em,
hold your fucking hands out!

01:58:15.405 --> 01:58:16.821
Take it.

01:58:43.905 --> 01:58:45.322
Everything's slowing down.

01:58:45.489 --> 01:58:46.946
You lost?

01:58:52.738 --> 01:58:54.238
They're looking at you.

01:59:52.738 --> 01:59:54.489
Who... Who is that?

01:59:57.572 --> 01:59:59.072
Is that AJ's dad?

01:59:59.155 --> 02:00:00.572
I think so.

02:00:14.072 --> 02:00:16.072
Is everything all right?

02:00:26.322 --> 02:00:27.780
You okay?

02:00:49.072 --> 02:00:50.988
You got something you need to tell me?
Yo, what are you...

02:00:51.072 --> 02:00:54.113
What do you gotta tell me? Huh?
You think I'm fucking stupid?

02:00:55.072 --> 02:00:56.780
Yo, get the fuck outta here.

02:00:56.905 --> 02:00:58.780
You think I'm fucking stupid?
Get the fuck outta here!

02:00:58.905 --> 02:00:59.946
Think I'm stupid?

02:01:00.072 --> 02:01:02.280
Get the fuck out...
What, you can't fucking hear?

02:01:02.405 --> 02:01:03.863
What's your pop do?

02:01:03.946 --> 02:01:06.696
Fuck's your problem, man?
Fuck off.

02:01:06.780 --> 02:01:10.280
Here's the fucking door.
There, you motherfucker!

02:01:10.405 --> 02:01:12.280
Get the fuck out.
Fuck you, man.

02:01:12.738 --> 02:01:14.405
Fuck you and your
old fuckin' pig!

02:01:14.488 --> 02:01:15.946
Get the fuck outta here!

02:01:17.946 --> 02:01:19.405
What's your problem?

02:01:21.571 --> 02:01:23.738
Fuck him up.
Fuck him up.

02:01:24.738 --> 02:01:26.364
Calm down!

02:01:52.613 --> 02:01:55.780
Jason.
Can you hear me, baby?

02:01:58.613 --> 02:02:00.113
Vanessa, get your father.

02:02:04.113 --> 02:02:05.571
Baby.

02:02:10.571 --> 02:02:12.113
You're a liar.

02:02:20.738 --> 02:02:22.113
He woke up?

02:02:24.613 --> 02:02:26.072
He say something?

02:02:29.404 --> 02:02:30.780
Hey, Jason.

02:02:36.780 --> 02:02:40.280
Why don't you sit down and wait.
I'm gonna get the car. Okay?

02:03:33.946 --> 02:03:35.571
What the hell happened to you?

02:03:35.655 --> 02:03:37.197
Yo, I need your help,
all right?

02:03:37.279 --> 02:03:40.155
Yeah, man, all right. What
you need my help for, man?

02:03:40.237 --> 02:03:41.821
I need a gun.

02:03:41.905 --> 02:03:43.072
You need a gun?

02:03:43.946 --> 02:03:45.404
Come on, man.

02:04:41.780 --> 02:04:44.905
What the fuck? What the
fuck are you doing?

02:04:45.404 --> 02:04:47.404
Wait, wait, what are you...
Get on the floor!

02:04:47.905 --> 02:04:51.072
Get on the fucking floor!
Oh, my God! Fuck!

02:04:57.072 --> 02:05:00.613
All right. All right, I'll
see you tomorrow. All right.

02:05:51.696 --> 02:05:53.404
Are you alone?

02:05:53.488 --> 02:05:54.696
What's going on?

02:05:55.237 --> 02:05:57.404
Don't look at me.
Turn around.

02:06:00.863 --> 02:06:02.154
We're gonna get in your car

02:06:03.905 --> 02:06:05.780
and you're just
gonna keep driving.

02:06:07.696 --> 02:06:10.821
Don't talk to me, or I'll shoot
you in the back of your head.

02:06:12.112 --> 02:06:13.529
Go.

02:06:51.821 --> 02:06:53.279
Turn around.

02:06:58.112 --> 02:06:59.571
Turn around.

02:07:23.780 --> 02:07:25.571
How did you get into my house?

02:07:31.029 --> 02:07:32.488
AJ let me in.

02:07:35.863 --> 02:07:37.321
Is he okay?

02:07:43.904 --> 02:07:45.363
Is he?

02:07:54.112 --> 02:07:55.613
Give me your wallet.

02:07:56.112 --> 02:07:57.529
Where's your wallet?

02:07:58.780 --> 02:08:00.488
It's in my jacket.
Give me your jacket.

02:08:01.279 --> 02:08:04.112
You want my wallet?
Here, take my wallet.

02:08:04.488 --> 02:08:07.404
Want my jacket? My jacket.

02:08:11.738 --> 02:08:13.154
Get on your knees.

02:08:14.363 --> 02:08:15.945
What did you do to my son?

02:08:16.029 --> 02:08:18.154
Get on your fucking knees!

02:08:29.655 --> 02:08:32.446
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes.

02:08:33.321 --> 02:08:35.321
Please, just tell me
my son's all right.

02:08:37.613 --> 02:08:39.446
This isn't about
your fucking son.

02:09:11.154 --> 02:09:12.820
I'm sorry, Jason.

02:09:16.279 --> 02:09:17.696
I'm sorry.

02:10:54.862 --> 02:10:57.029
<i>It was
a tight race for over a year</i>

02:10:57.112 --> 02:10:58.820
<i>between Cross and Kellerman,</i>

02:10:58.904 --> 02:11:01.612
<i>and then unprecedented events
over the last month</i>

02:11:01.695 --> 02:11:04.029
<i>made to threaten
Cross' election bid.</i>

02:11:04.112 --> 02:11:06.904
<i>First, allegations of underage
drinking at his house,</i>

02:11:06.987 --> 02:11:10.112
<i>and then a violent robbery from
a yet-unidentified intruder</i>

02:11:10.196 --> 02:11:13.570
<i>that left his son hospitalized
with a concussion.</i>

02:11:13.654 --> 02:11:17.112
<i>Remarkably, Cross has managed
to right his campaign,</i>

02:11:17.196 --> 02:11:19.446
<i>and now, as you see,
the District Attorney</i>

02:11:19.528 --> 02:11:22.237
<i>has just won the election
for Attorney General.</i>

02:11:22.321 --> 02:11:24.654
<i>We will go live now
as Senator McFarley prepares</i>

02:11:24.737 --> 02:11:26.321
<i>to address
the crowd of supporters.</i>

02:11:28.154 --> 02:11:32.363
<i>I've had the honor of knowing
Avery Cross since he was a boy.</i>

02:11:40.363 --> 02:11:44.862
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, it's my
pleasure and my greatest honor</i>

02:11:44.945 --> 02:11:47.279
<i>to introduce
the next Attorney General</i>

02:11:47.363 --> 02:11:50.321
<i>of the state of New York, Avery Cross!
Go. Curtain.</i>

02:11:50.404 --> 02:11:53.570
All right, AJ, you gotta go.
You gotta go out there.

02:11:53.654 --> 02:11:56.154
There's a flag.
Go. Go where the kid is. Go.

02:12:14.904 --> 02:12:16.321
<i>Thank you!</i>

02:12:16.779 --> 02:12:17.987
<i>Thank you.</i>

02:12:20.363 --> 02:12:21.779
<i>Thank you.</i>

02:12:24.112 --> 02:12:25.570
<i>Thank you.</i>

02:12:28.987 --> 02:12:30.445
<i>Thank you.</i>

02:12:32.363 --> 02:12:34.279
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

02:12:36.363 --> 02:12:39.695
Avery! Avery! Avery!

02:13:55.987 --> 02:13:57.445
Yeah?

02:13:57.528 --> 02:13:58.987
Mr. Anthony?

02:13:59.071 --> 02:14:00.112
Yeah.

02:14:00.196 --> 02:14:04.695
Hey, I, uh... I called you, said
I was gonna be out here today.

02:14:05.570 --> 02:14:08.779
Oh, right, of course.
Yeah. Well, you're early.

02:14:09.320 --> 02:14:12.904
Yeah. There's only, like,
one bus headed out here.

02:14:14.196 --> 02:14:15.320
So...

02:14:15.403 --> 02:14:17.236
You're not from
around here, huh?

02:14:18.112 --> 02:14:20.196
No. I'm headed out west.

02:14:20.654 --> 02:14:23.154
So you ready?
Wanna go take a look at it?

02:14:23.236 --> 02:14:24.316
Yeah.
I'll just get my coat.

02:14:24.362 --> 02:14:25.820
All right.
All right.

02:14:34.987 --> 02:14:36.445
It runs great.

02:14:37.779 --> 02:14:41.112
It's got a lot of miles on it, but
I kept up with the maintenance.

02:14:43.278 --> 02:14:44.695
How much you want for it?

02:14:46.445 --> 02:14:48.945
Well, I was thinking
I need five.

02:14:50.528 --> 02:14:51.945
All right.

02:15:05.654 --> 02:15:07.654
You ever ridden
one of these before?
