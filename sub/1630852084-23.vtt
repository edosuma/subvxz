- You can be moved.
- Well, move me.

07:41.047 --> 07:45.018
- Move, Mister--come on, Leah!
Move! Come on, Leah.

07:45.118 --> 07:47.420
- Cora, you ain't got
to be so hostility!

07:47.520 --> 07:48.888
- [bell rings]

07:48.988 --> 07:51.224
- MR. BROWN: Tagged me in
my chest and everything.

07:51.324 --> 07:52.592
Do it look caved in?

07:52.692 --> 07:53.660
- VINNY: That sure looked
caved in.

07:53.760 --> 07:55.094
- What do you think
they about to go?

07:55.194 --> 07:56.996
- I think she's going up
there to try to stop him.

07:57.096 --> 07:59.532
- Well, we need to go too.
- Go up there for what?

07:59.599 --> 08:00.733
- Just in case
they need our help.

08:00.833 --> 08:01.934
- Let me tell you something.

08:02.035 --> 08:03.536
If Jeremy go up
to that man's house,

08:03.603 --> 08:05.338
he need to get his ass whooped.

08:05.438 --> 08:07.340
- I'm going to go help--
- Go right ahead!

08:07.473 --> 08:09.275
You know everybody in
this town got a gun!

08:09.375 --> 08:11.611
- Oh!
- That's right.

08:11.711 --> 08:12.979
You don't wanna go up
there dressed like that.

08:13.079 --> 08:14.981
You look like a
moose in the bushes.

08:15.081 --> 08:17.250
Those colors on you will
definitely stand out.

08:17.350 --> 08:18.885
- [unintelligible]

08:18.985 --> 08:20.787
- Talkin' about two
deers in the woods.

08:20.887 --> 08:22.956
You--they will shoot you quick.
- Yeah, and I don't wanna--

08:23.056 --> 08:24.757
ain't no need of
both of us getting shot.

08:24.857 --> 08:26.626
- The both of us ain't
gonna get shot 'cause, ah,

08:26.726 --> 08:28.728
Vinny ain't going.

08:28.828 --> 08:31.030
- I ain't got to be last.
I just gotta be faster--

08:31.130 --> 08:34.600
- When guns come out, you ain't
gonna be faster than Vinny.

08:34.701 --> 08:35.702
- You can outrun me, then?

08:35.802 --> 08:38.504
- I can outrun
somebody with a gun.

08:38.571 --> 08:39.973
- You can outrun me?
- Outrun you.

08:40.073 --> 08:41.841
They'd be like, what Brown?
He gone.

08:41.941 --> 08:43.276
- Listen, I can't--
let's do this.

08:43.376 --> 08:44.611
- I'll be like a blur.

08:44.711 --> 08:46.813
- Line it up right here.
- Anytime. Let's do it.

08:46.913 --> 08:48.181
Let's do it.
Let's do it.

08:48.281 --> 08:50.550
- We about to shut this down.
- Ready, set, go!

08:53.219 --> 08:54.854
- You ain't running!
That's walk racing!

08:54.954 --> 08:56.022
That's...

08:59.959 --> 09:02.695
- BOTH: [panting]
- Vinny--

09:02.795 --> 09:04.631
- Whew. Let's don't do that
no more.

09:04.731 --> 09:07.266
- Let's just wait.

09:07.367 --> 09:08.668
- Ah, my head.

09:08.768 --> 09:10.770
We didn't even make it to
the other side of the house.

09:10.870 --> 09:13.006
- Them blood pressure
pills is kicking in, man.

09:14.707 --> 09:17.644
- I need to get my
prostate checked.

09:17.744 --> 09:19.879
- I think I'mma check my
own when I get to my room.

09:22.482 --> 09:26.019
Not yours, mine.

09:26.119 --> 09:30.189
I need a joint and
a prostate check.

09:30.290 --> 09:31.357
- Is that the stuff you into?

09:31.491 --> 09:32.825
- Oh my god, some
freaky stuff.

09:32.925 --> 09:35.828
Don't ever come in my room
when the door closed, please.

09:35.928 --> 09:37.563
And if I die, don't
look under my bed.

09:37.664 --> 09:39.499
You will be shocked.

09:39.532 --> 09:41.701
- ♪

09:44.271 --> 09:45.539
- ♪

09:45.639 --> 09:49.509
- Well, stay naked, girl.
I'mma catch the bus over there.

09:49.609 --> 09:51.444
Yes. I got a transfer.

09:51.545 --> 09:53.113
See you in about two hours.

09:53.213 --> 09:56.149
- Hey! Vinny!

09:56.249 --> 09:58.685
Did they come back yet?
- No, I ain't heard nothin'.

09:58.785 --> 10:00.787
Nobody back.
- Really?

10:00.887 --> 10:02.656
- Yo, where's my mom and dad?

10:02.756 --> 10:04.024
- You know about nipple clips?

10:04.124 --> 10:06.560
- Hey!
- What?

10:06.660 --> 10:08.628
- He need to know
what's going on.

10:08.728 --> 10:09.830
- Hush!

10:09.930 --> 10:12.132
Uh, your momma--
your parents went out.

10:12.232 --> 10:13.834
- Okay, well, I just
finished my homework.

10:15.802 --> 10:19.573
- Okay, that's good.
- Yeah.

10:19.673 --> 10:23.109
- Well?
- Well what?

10:23.210 --> 10:27.147
- This is usually when I eat.
- Oh, well, go on and eat.

10:27.247 --> 10:29.449
- That's your job, right?
- Spoonfeed him?

10:29.549 --> 10:30.617
- Yeah.

10:30.717 --> 10:31.885
- You need me to
make you something?

10:31.985 --> 10:34.621
- Porridge and just
feed him in the mouth?

10:34.721 --> 10:36.189
- We're supposed to fix
him something to eat.

10:36.289 --> 10:38.124
- Hey, there's nothing
in here to eat.

10:38.225 --> 10:39.359
- Well, fine.
You've been eating

10:39.459 --> 10:42.429
your momma's cooking,
you might need a detox.

10:42.529 --> 10:44.264
- Good idea.

10:44.364 --> 10:45.499
- What?
- Nothin'.

10:45.599 --> 10:47.167
I said, uh,
something Goldilocks.

10:47.267 --> 10:49.503
I don't know. I ain't...

10:49.603 --> 10:51.505
- Where are they?
- They--they went out.

10:51.605 --> 10:52.973
- Where?

10:53.073 --> 10:55.909
- Boy, what do I look like?
A GPP tracking device to you?

10:58.378 --> 10:59.746
- [chuckles] You kind of
look like an ankle bracelet

10:59.846 --> 11:01.248
with that outfit on.

11:01.381 --> 11:06.686
- [laughter]

11:06.786 --> 11:08.255
- We ain't finished
laughing, Brown!

11:08.388 --> 11:11.224
- [laughter]

11:11.391 --> 11:13.393
- Don't put your hands on me.
Don't put your hands on me.

11:13.493 --> 11:15.896
- That boy got jokes.
- Yeah, you got jokes, don't ya?

11:15.996 --> 11:17.864
- VINNY: That boy's funny.
He's funny.

11:17.964 --> 11:19.733
- He about to come up missing.

11:19.833 --> 11:22.102
- VINNY: [laughs]

11:22.202 --> 11:23.570
- Is dinner ready?

11:23.670 --> 11:25.172
- No.
- What?

11:25.272 --> 11:28.275
- Yeah, Mom and Dad aren't here.
- Okay, well, where are they?

11:28.408 --> 11:30.410
- Well, your mom's tied up right
now with clothesline wire--

11:30.477 --> 11:32.245
- MR. BROWN: Not now! Not--

11:32.412 --> 11:35.448
Ah, your momma went out.
She goin' out.

11:35.549 --> 11:37.818
- She needs to know what's
breaking up their happy home.

11:37.918 --> 11:39.553
She needs to know.

11:39.653 --> 11:41.721
- What?
- What about our home?

11:41.822 --> 11:44.224
- Grandpa, did you
take your meds today?

11:44.357 --> 11:46.459
- Not all of them.
- Don't--don't worry about him.

11:46.560 --> 11:48.762
He ain't saying nothin'.
He ain't talkin' about nothin'.

11:48.862 --> 11:49.963
Let's--let's--
okay, everybody, let's eat.

11:50.063 --> 11:52.365
Let me get y'all something.

11:52.432 --> 11:53.533
Uh, what y'all want?

11:53.633 --> 11:56.169
Okay, let me get y'all...
I know what kids like.

11:58.738 --> 12:00.474
Right here.
Bam, look at that!

12:00.574 --> 12:01.541
Gourmet meal.

12:01.641 --> 12:05.212
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam!

12:10.484 --> 12:12.686
There you go.

12:12.786 --> 12:15.789
- Uh...this is
not--this is not dinner.

12:15.889 --> 12:17.257
- Girl, when I was your age--

12:17.390 --> 12:19.526
I wish I had some vio--
violin music.

12:21.828 --> 12:25.265
- How long ago exactly was that?
- A long time ago.

12:25.398 --> 12:28.635
All we had was porridge.

12:28.735 --> 12:30.470
In the forest. Eat, girl!

12:33.073 --> 12:35.008
- Next he's gonna tell us he's
one of the Three Little Bears.

12:35.108 --> 12:37.477
- [laughs] He does look
like one of 'em, don't he?

12:37.577 --> 12:39.045
- [laughter]

12:39.146 --> 12:40.514
- Like, how old does
he think we are?

12:40.614 --> 12:43.250
Twelve?

12:43.350 --> 12:45.152
- Wait a minute. We?

12:45.252 --> 12:46.720
You are 15.

12:46.820 --> 12:50.857
We're not on the same level.
- She don't stop.

12:50.957 --> 12:53.827
- Hey, y'all gotta eat them dry.
We don't have no milk.

12:53.927 --> 12:54.995
- Do you know what?

12:55.095 --> 12:56.496
I'll just wait till
Mom and Dad get home.

12:56.596 --> 12:57.731
- Yeah, good idea.

12:57.831 --> 12:59.466
- Or better yet,
is Miss Cora here?

12:59.566 --> 13:01.268
- No, she went out too.

13:01.368 --> 13:02.802
- Darn.

13:02.903 --> 13:05.172
- Stop that cussing.

13:05.272 --> 13:06.373
- I said darn.

13:06.439 --> 13:09.943
- Well, you was too close
to the other D-word.

13:10.043 --> 13:12.112
- I was just hoping
she would've cooked.

13:12.212 --> 13:14.548
- Cora ain't the only one
around here that can cook.

13:14.648 --> 13:15.982
I cook too.

13:16.082 --> 13:17.684
- Wait, you can cook?

13:17.784 --> 13:19.386
- What, can I cook?

13:19.419 --> 13:22.222
Leroy L. Brown.

13:22.389 --> 13:24.825
The L is for Leave A
Delicious Taste In Your Mouth

13:24.925 --> 13:26.893
After You Bite My Food
And Everything.

13:28.528 --> 13:29.996
- That's a long middle name.

13:30.096 --> 13:32.165
- It's more like
Lose Your Lunch.

13:32.265 --> 13:34.134
- [laughter]

13:34.234 --> 13:36.136
- Y'all want me to cook, then?
Y'all want something?

13:36.236 --> 13:37.571
- Well, I'll have a salad.

13:37.671 --> 13:39.406
- So wait a minute.
Oh, let me get y'all something.

13:39.439 --> 13:41.608
I'mma cook y'all--
you don't even know.

13:41.708 --> 13:45.812
Y'all better know I come
from a long line of cookers.

13:45.912 --> 13:48.215
We're the most diabolical
cookers in the America.

13:48.348 --> 13:51.051
- Where did he
just get that from?

13:51.151 --> 13:55.522
- Okay. How can I help you?

13:55.622 --> 13:56.823
- Where did he get the gum from?

13:56.923 --> 13:58.658
- Are you chewing imaginary gum?

13:58.758 --> 14:00.760
- Yeah. What do you need, baby?

14:00.861 --> 14:02.529
- Okay, well, I'll have a salad.

14:02.629 --> 14:04.130
- MR. BROWN: Just one salad.
- With caesar dressing.

14:04.231 --> 14:06.766
Something light.
- Something light, okay.

14:06.867 --> 14:08.101
You--you, sir?

14:08.201 --> 14:09.469
- And I can get whatever I want?

14:09.569 --> 14:11.805
- Anything you want.

14:11.905 --> 14:13.039
- Okay, well, let
me get a burger.

14:13.140 --> 14:14.374
- Burger.
One burger coming up.

14:14.407 --> 14:16.510
- Well hell,
since you taking orders,

14:16.610 --> 14:18.111
I'll have a steak!

14:18.211 --> 14:19.813
- You want one steak?
- Mm-hmm.

14:19.913 --> 14:20.947
- A steak?
What kind of steak?

14:21.047 --> 14:24.217
- I'd like a...filet mignon.

14:24.384 --> 14:27.621
- Uh, I thought you
wanted steak, not fish.

14:27.721 --> 14:29.589
- Fish filet, fool.

14:29.689 --> 14:30.991
- Fish filet?

14:31.091 --> 14:33.093
You--you--okay, how
you want it prepared?

14:33.193 --> 14:35.095
- I'd like it well done.
- Well done, okay.

14:35.195 --> 14:37.164
Let me get this right for you.
- Mm-hmm.

14:37.264 --> 14:40.033
- You wanted, uh, one salad.
- Uh, yeah.

14:40.133 --> 14:42.235
- Caesar dressing, light.
- SANDRA: Light.

14:42.402 --> 14:43.503
- And you'll have a burger.

14:43.603 --> 14:45.906
- No, no, no.
A cheeseburger with bacon.

14:46.006 --> 14:47.140
- Cheeseburger with bacon?
- Yeah.

14:47.240 --> 14:48.742
- Extra cheese?
- Yeah, extra cheese.

14:48.842 --> 14:51.211
- Right, okay.
And you want one steak.

14:51.344 --> 14:53.847
- Mm-hmm.
- A Filet McNog.

14:53.947 --> 14:55.782
- McNog. Filet McNog.

14:55.882 --> 14:57.584
- And would you like
a potato with that?

14:57.684 --> 14:58.852
- Curly fries.
- Curly fries?

14:58.952 --> 15:00.420
- Can you do curly fries?
- Yes!

15:00.520 --> 15:02.956
- Get out of here!
- I can curl 'em myself!

15:03.056 --> 15:05.125
Take them back and curl them.

15:05.225 --> 15:07.027
- Brown, you know what?
This is really nice of you.

15:07.127 --> 15:08.929
- I--I--that's 'cause I'm nice.
- No, I'm serious.

15:09.029 --> 15:10.363
You don't normally do
nice stuff,

15:10.463 --> 15:12.766
but this right here is nice.
- Yeah, I mean, really, yeah.

15:12.866 --> 15:13.934
- VINNY: You never
do nuttin' nice.

15:14.034 --> 15:15.769
- Yo, I got ya.
- You ain't dress nice.

15:15.869 --> 15:19.172
- [laughter]

15:19.272 --> 15:23.510
- We got two bowls of
porridge coming right up!

15:23.610 --> 15:24.945
- What the hell?

15:25.045 --> 15:26.613
- I don't know what y'all think
this here--what y'all think?

15:26.713 --> 15:28.849
I'm some kind of restaurant
worker or something?

15:28.949 --> 15:31.585
I'm not gonna fix nothin'!

15:31.685 --> 15:34.521
- Mr. Brown, that's not right.
- Well, I'm sorry.

15:34.621 --> 15:36.289
- Well, can you even cook?

15:36.389 --> 15:38.992
- Yes, but I'm not gonna cook
all that steak, potatoes,

15:39.092 --> 15:41.761
caesar salad, dressing light,
cheeseburger, bacon.

15:41.862 --> 15:43.930
I got a good memory, though.

15:44.030 --> 15:45.332
- You don't even have
to cook the salad.

15:45.398 --> 15:47.968
You just...
- I cook what I wanna cook.

15:48.068 --> 15:49.035
- You know what? It's fine.

15:49.135 --> 15:50.337
I'll just go and
finish my homework.

15:50.437 --> 15:53.840
- Sorry, kid!
And remember, be nice.

15:53.940 --> 15:56.042
- I'll just starve.

15:56.143 --> 15:58.044
- Boy, you ate
when you got home.

15:58.145 --> 15:59.079
- That was a snack.

15:59.179 --> 16:00.547
It was, like, one
little applesauce.

16:00.647 --> 16:02.516
- Well, can't you wait
till your momma get back?

16:02.616 --> 16:04.985
- I can't believe this.
- What happened?

16:05.085 --> 16:08.822
- Boy, shut up.
She found the love letters.

16:08.922 --> 16:10.790
- How could they do this to me?

16:10.891 --> 16:13.693
- Do what?
- They have my phone cloned.

16:13.793 --> 16:16.997
- They put a clown
in your phone?

16:17.097 --> 16:18.465
- Like a ice cream clone?

16:21.001 --> 16:22.802
- No--
- BOTH: Clone!

16:22.903 --> 16:24.004
- Like chocolate,
vanilla, strawberry,

16:24.104 --> 16:25.572
or something like that?

16:25.672 --> 16:28.141
- BOTH: No, cloned!
- What y'all talking about?

16:28.241 --> 16:29.509
- Old people don't
know what that means.

16:29.609 --> 16:30.777
- Obviously.

16:30.877 --> 16:32.379
- Y'all young people
explain it to the old people.

16:32.479 --> 16:33.680
- VINNY: Yeah.

16:33.780 --> 16:35.148
- It's when somebody can see
everything on your phone.

16:35.248 --> 16:36.383
- VINNY: Well, why
didn't you say that?

16:36.483 --> 16:38.718
- If you said "copy,"
like "copy something."

16:38.819 --> 16:40.854
You trying to be all difficult--

16:40.954 --> 16:42.155
- I mean, we're old,
but we ain't stupid.

16:42.255 --> 16:43.523
- That's right.

16:43.623 --> 16:45.926
We know the difference
between "clone" and "cone."

16:46.026 --> 16:47.327
- Yeah.
- And--

16:47.394 --> 16:48.895
- An ice cream cone
and a clone clone.

16:48.995 --> 16:50.997
- Ice cream cone!

16:51.097 --> 16:52.365
- Well, that's what it is.
It's a copy.

16:52.465 --> 16:53.867
You trying to be all difficult.

16:53.967 --> 16:55.368
Copy, clone.

16:55.468 --> 16:56.937
Copy sound quicker.
Copy.

16:57.037 --> 16:59.973
- Okay, fine, it's copy!
That's what it is, copy.

17:00.073 --> 17:01.508
- So they got a
copy of your phone.

17:01.608 --> 17:02.976
- Yes, and mine too.

17:03.076 --> 17:05.378
- Wait, what?
You knew about this?

17:05.479 --> 17:07.681
- Yeah.
- And you didn't tell me?

17:07.781 --> 17:09.249
- I--I don't like you like that.

17:09.349 --> 17:11.051
- Y'all better get along.

17:12.519 --> 17:14.087
- You know what?
This is such a violation.

17:14.187 --> 17:16.022
I'm so mad.

17:16.122 --> 17:17.858
- Then what y'all
been talkin' about?

17:17.958 --> 17:18.959
- Well, nothing bad.

17:19.059 --> 17:20.827
But they shouldn't
be spying on me.

17:20.927 --> 17:21.928
- Well, if there's
nothing on there,

17:22.028 --> 17:23.563
there's nothing for
you to be mad about.

17:23.663 --> 17:25.365
- Okay, well,
it's the principle.

17:25.432 --> 17:26.666
You're old.
You wouldn't get it.

17:26.766 --> 17:27.968
- Wait, wait, you--

17:28.068 --> 17:29.703
you was trying to make
some of them tick tick videos?

17:29.803 --> 17:30.737
- VINNY: Yeah.

17:33.540 --> 17:34.708
- [bell rings]

17:37.677 --> 17:40.013
- Hey, everybody.

17:40.113 --> 17:41.748
- Have you and Dad
been reading my texts?

17:41.848 --> 17:43.550
- Honey, we'll talk
about this later, okay?

17:43.650 --> 17:46.720
- No, we need to
talk about this now.

17:46.820 --> 17:49.089
- Ooh.
- Now is not the time.

17:49.189 --> 17:50.557
- No, that is just wrong.

17:50.657 --> 17:53.593
- Sandra, not now!

17:53.693 --> 17:55.328
- You know what?
You make this so hard to like--

17:55.428 --> 17:58.865
- I said not now!
Go to your room!

17:58.965 --> 18:00.066
- But I--

18:00.167 --> 18:01.501
- Didn't your momma just
say go to your room?

18:01.601 --> 18:03.170
That's what she meant.
Go in your room.

18:03.336 --> 18:04.738
Phillip, you can
go in your room too.

18:04.838 --> 18:06.206
Thank you.

18:07.741 --> 18:09.743
- Look, I'm not with her.
I'm just trying to eat.

18:11.044 --> 18:12.245
- Boy, if you don't
go to your room...

18:12.345 --> 18:13.413
You gonna eat soon.

18:13.513 --> 18:14.915
- When is soon?
He had us eating--

18:15.015 --> 18:16.616
- I said go to your
room right now!

18:16.716 --> 18:18.018
- Boy, you better go!

18:18.118 --> 18:20.921
- She loud. She gets mad.

18:21.021 --> 18:23.123
- I can see that.
That's scary.

18:23.223 --> 18:25.025
- Yeah, I'd bounce up
out of here if I was you.

18:25.125 --> 18:26.459
- Yeah, go.

- Yeah, raise your hand up.

18:37.537 --> 18:39.773

right now is some money!

19:09.369 --> 19:10.704

put Jeremy in jail.

You ask us.
We didn't ask you.

so we picked "or not."

there, helping her cheat?
