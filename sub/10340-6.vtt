01:58.076 --> 02:00.869
Diane, it is 4:28 a.m.

02:01.037 --> 02:03.247
I have just been woken up
by the most God-awful racket,

02:03.414 --> 02:06.834
which you can probably hear
over the sound of my voice.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.920
Can you hear that?

02:10.088 --> 02:13.006
Up until this moment, I've experienced
nothing at the Great Northern Hotel

02:13.174 --> 02:15.676
but the most pleasant,
courteous service imaginable.

02:15.844 --> 02:18.887
However, it just goes to prove the point
that once a traveler leaves his home,

02:19.055 --> 02:23.851
he loses almost 100 percent
of his ability to control his environment.

02:24.018 --> 02:26.353
Diane, I was wondering if you could
overnight express to me

02:26.521 --> 02:28.355
two pair of those
Ear-Pillow silicone earplugs

02:28.523 --> 02:30.399
which I used on my last trip
to New York.

02:30.567 --> 02:32.568
Naturally, I didn't bring them with me
on this trip,

02:32.735 --> 02:34.444
because I didn't feel
it would be necessary.

02:34.612 --> 02:36.155
However...

02:51.838 --> 02:52.880
Coffee?

02:53.047 --> 02:55.257
Please.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.718
- What's with the choir practice?
- Heh.

02:57.886 --> 03:00.429
Business junket. From Iceland.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.598
Got in about 3 this morning.

03:02.765 --> 03:04.016
Ohh.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.810
- They're on my floor.
- Lucky you.

03:06.978 --> 03:09.396
It'll take them a day or two
to reset their biological clocks.

03:09.564 --> 03:12.733
- Heh. Hope the herring holds out.
- Mm.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.114
How are you?

03:19.616 --> 03:23.202
Well, Audrey, to be perfectly honest,
I'm tired and a little on edge.

03:23.369 --> 03:24.578
Oh.

03:29.125 --> 03:30.209
I got a job.

03:30.376 --> 03:31.793
Good for you.

03:31.961 --> 03:34.546
And I thought maybe now
I could help you with your case.

03:34.714 --> 03:35.964
Guess where I'm going...

03:36.132 --> 03:38.050
Audrey, you'll have to excuse me
this morning.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.302
I'm running late.
I only have time for coffee.

03:40.470 --> 03:42.304
Well, maybe I could go with you.

03:42.472 --> 03:45.140
Wednesdays were traditionally
a school day when I was your age.

03:48.728 --> 03:51.313
I can't believe
you were ever my age.

03:51.481 --> 03:53.857
I've got the pictures to prove it.

03:54.692 --> 03:57.653
- How old are you?
- Eighteen.

03:58.655 --> 04:00.781
We'll see you later, Audrey.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.866
See you later.

04:06.496 --> 04:07.537
Bye.

04:07.705 --> 04:10.415
Ha, ha.
I'll see you later, Sons of Olden!

04:10.583 --> 04:11.625
How do you say that?

04:16.339 --> 04:19.174
My brother will love you guys.

04:28.476 --> 04:30.227
Brother Ben, I bring you greetings

04:30.395 --> 04:33.939
from the fertile treeless tundra
of Iceland.

04:34.107 --> 04:38.694
We have had complaints
from nearly every guest in the hotel.

04:38.861 --> 04:40.404
What are they on, nitrous oxide?

04:40.571 --> 04:43.865
They are insane
for the Ghostwood Estates project.

04:44.033 --> 04:47.869
I have had more serious fun
in two days with these Nordic animals.

04:48.037 --> 04:50.205
And, Ben, I'm in love.

04:50.373 --> 04:53.041
Her name is Heba.
She's a giant snow queen

04:53.209 --> 04:55.877
with a smile
like a sunrise on an ice floe.

04:56.045 --> 04:58.547
You could go blind looking at this girl.
Look at this.

04:59.465 --> 05:02.384
You see what she gave me?
An entire leg of lamb.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.177
- Jerry, come on.
- Is that beautiful?

05:04.345 --> 05:06.722
Come on, look, you crush some garlic,
some fresh mint,

05:06.889 --> 05:08.015
that's rotisserie heaven.

05:08.182 --> 05:09.391
Come on, you gotta meet her.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.435
Jerry, just grab some downtime,
will you?

05:12.812 --> 05:17.983
We've laid in a gala reception
for your fair-haired boys tonight.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.277
All of Twin Peaks'
best and brightest.

05:20.445 --> 05:21.778
We're holding it in a phone booth?

05:21.946 --> 05:24.323
And if we still need a kicker

05:24.490 --> 05:28.577
to nail the sale, I'm thinking
that maybe they might enjoy

05:28.745 --> 05:33.498
a little road trip up to, uh,
you-know-where. Ah?

05:33.666 --> 05:38.086
Jack's. I am honored to know you.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.091
Ben?

05:43.926 --> 05:45.427
Leland, what are you doing here?

05:45.595 --> 05:49.931
Well, I know there's a new
investment group arriving today.

05:50.099 --> 05:51.892
If there's anything I can do...

05:52.352 --> 05:56.605
Leland, the best thing that
you can do is follow doctor's orders.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.607
Go home. You need your rest.

05:58.775 --> 06:00.984
I just feel...

06:02.153 --> 06:05.781
I just feel I need something
to occupy my mind.

06:08.951 --> 06:11.828
Leland, will you take some time off,
for God's sakes?

06:11.996 --> 06:14.289
Fly somewhere. Uh, take Sarah.

06:14.457 --> 06:18.085
I'm afraid to go. I'm afraid.

06:21.923 --> 06:23.340
Hawk, we're here

06:23.508 --> 06:24.716
at Jacques Renault's apartment.

06:24.884 --> 06:27.302
Get over here as soon as you can.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.971
- Morning.
- Morning.

06:30.139 --> 06:31.139
What do you got, Harry?

06:31.307 --> 06:32.808
Jacques Renault's
a Canadian national.

06:32.975 --> 06:35.435
He worked the lumber fields
this side of the border

06:35.603 --> 06:39.314
until he put on a little excess tonnage
a couple of seasons ago.

06:39.482 --> 06:41.608
That's when he started bartending
at the Roadhouse.

06:41.776 --> 06:43.151
Harry,
are there any more doughnuts?

06:43.319 --> 06:45.654
Sure. Andy.

06:45.822 --> 06:46.822
Thank you.

06:46.989 --> 06:48.490
Better wash that down
with a cup a joe.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.659
I didn't get too much sleep last night.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.369
Yeah, you do look a little peaked.

06:52.537 --> 06:56.206
There's a large group of insane men
staying on my floor.

06:56.374 --> 06:57.999
Jacques Renault turn up?

06:58.167 --> 06:59.584
No one's seen him for two days.

06:59.752 --> 07:01.586
We've canvassed the building
and the Roadhouse.

07:01.754 --> 07:04.214
- I sent Hawk to roust his brother.
- I'll get back to you.

07:04.382 --> 07:06.758
But it looks like Bernie's jumped bail.
There's no sign.

07:06.926 --> 07:09.219
- Morning, Agent Cooper.
- Morning, doc.

07:09.387 --> 07:13.849
The blood on the shirt you found here
is AB negative.

07:14.016 --> 07:15.016
It's not Laura's blood.

07:15.184 --> 07:19.521
So it was Jacques Renault's blood
on Leo Johnson's shirt. Hmm.

07:21.899 --> 07:23.150
Hmm.

07:23.985 --> 07:26.987
Oh. Thank you, Andy.

07:32.410 --> 07:33.618
Mm.

07:33.786 --> 07:35.537
What about Leo Johnson?
Could you hold this?

07:35.705 --> 07:37.497
The APB went out last night.
Nothing yet.

07:37.665 --> 07:40.625
- I need you to find out something.
- Could you give me a leg up here?

07:40.793 --> 07:41.793
Sure.

07:41.961 --> 07:44.379
What's Jacques Renault's blood type?

07:44.547 --> 07:46.089
- Alley-oop.
- Unh.

07:49.010 --> 07:51.303
Jacques Renault's blood
is AB negative.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.721
Thanks, doc.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.723
My pleasure.

07:56.559 --> 07:59.561
Holy smoke. Flesh World again.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.229
Yeah.

08:02.231 --> 08:05.066
Harry, remember that ad
with the picture of Ronette Pulaski?

08:05.234 --> 08:06.735
We traced that ad.

08:06.903 --> 08:09.571
It came into the magazine
in a plain envelope, no name.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.615
Well, the magazine's
a clearing-house.

08:11.782 --> 08:13.783
Readers write letters
in response to the ads

08:13.951 --> 08:15.911
and mail them in to the magazine.

08:16.078 --> 08:19.080
The magazine forwards them on
to the advertisers.

08:19.248 --> 08:21.583
No direct contact.

08:23.044 --> 08:25.670
Ronette received her letters
at this post office box.

08:25.838 --> 08:26.922
That's a local ZIP code.

08:27.089 --> 08:28.715
Now, my guess is
that this post office box

08:28.883 --> 08:31.968
will be registered
under the name of Jacques Renault.

08:33.054 --> 08:35.180
Let's see
who was writing to Ronette.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.307
Postmarked Georgia.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.230
Good night.

08:43.397 --> 08:44.814
I don't know.

08:44.982 --> 08:47.108
The beard sort of ruins
the effect of the lingerie.

08:47.276 --> 08:49.110
What do you think?

08:50.947 --> 08:52.906
The guy's no Georgia peach.

08:53.074 --> 08:54.699
Poor bastard.

08:54.867 --> 08:56.201
By the way, Harry, did you notice

08:56.369 --> 08:59.204
the picture of Leo Johnson's truck
on that page?

09:09.632 --> 09:11.049
I love it when you cook for me.

09:11.217 --> 09:13.218
Leo hates my cooking.

09:13.386 --> 09:17.472
Leo missed the boat with you, baby.

09:17.640 --> 09:18.890
The biggest mistake of your life

09:19.058 --> 09:22.269
was dropping out of the 11th grade
and marrying that road hog.

09:24.814 --> 09:27.649
What would you do
if he walked in right now?

09:28.109 --> 09:35.240
Come here.

09:41.163 --> 09:44.791
Hey, Leo. How's it going, man?

09:44.959 --> 09:46.751
What a surprise.

09:46.919 --> 09:51.590
Now, Leo, Shelly tells me
that you don't like her cooking.

09:51.757 --> 09:55.719
Tell you what, she and I,
we're gonna sit here

09:55.886 --> 09:59.222
while you cook breakfast for us,
you hump.

09:59.390 --> 10:03.143
And if you so much as utter
one harsh syllable

10:03.311 --> 10:08.148
to this beautiful girl,

10:08.316 --> 10:11.693
I'm gonna shoot your ugly face off,
okay, man?

10:15.865 --> 10:16.865
Sheriff's deputy.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.034
Now, Shelly,
you do exactly what we said,

10:19.201 --> 10:20.535
and everything's gonna be fine.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.787
Okay? Come here. Mm.

10:35.134 --> 10:36.384
Oh, hi, Andy. Come on in.

10:36.552 --> 10:37.886
Hi, Shelly.

10:38.054 --> 10:40.305
Do you know
when Leo might be back?

10:40.473 --> 10:41.723
Is he in some kind of trouble?

10:41.891 --> 10:43.642
No, we just wanna talk to him.

10:43.809 --> 10:45.644
This wouldn't be about Laura, would it?

10:45.811 --> 10:46.853
Why do you say that?

10:47.021 --> 10:50.565
Well, I heard him talking
to this guy, Jacques, the night he left.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.233
Jacques Renault?

10:52.401 --> 10:54.235
Yeah. They were outside arguing.

10:54.403 --> 10:57.572
I couldn't hear exactly, but they did
seem to be arguing about her,

10:57.740 --> 10:59.074
and then they drove off together.

10:59.241 --> 11:01.868
Shelly, you call us
the minute he gets in touch with you.

11:02.036 --> 11:05.121
Okay, I will. Thanks for stopping by.

11:12.588 --> 11:15.090
- How'd I do?
- You did great. Oh.

11:19.261 --> 11:21.429
You drive me crazy.

11:30.314 --> 11:32.273
- Hello?
- Hi.

11:32.441 --> 11:34.275
Hi, Leo. Where you calling from?

11:34.443 --> 11:36.361
Has anybody come by?

11:36.529 --> 11:39.322
What's that?
Is anybody looking for you?

11:39.782 --> 11:41.282
Why would anybody
be looking for you?

11:41.450 --> 11:43.034
Are you sure?

11:43.202 --> 11:44.369
You know how paranoid you get

11:44.537 --> 11:46.955
when you've been popping bennies
on the road a couple of days.

11:47.123 --> 11:48.248
So when are you coming home?

11:48.416 --> 11:49.958
Soon. Everything okay?

11:50.126 --> 11:52.627
Yeah, everything's fine, Leo.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.214
Come on home.

11:56.382 --> 11:58.466
I miss you, Shelly.

12:00.469 --> 12:01.970
I miss you too.

12:19.655 --> 12:21.364
Hey, good-looking.

12:21.532 --> 12:22.907
Hope you don't mind my coming.

12:23.075 --> 12:24.659
Oh, no.

12:24.827 --> 12:26.661
Nadine won't be back
from that patent attorney

12:26.829 --> 12:28.913
over there in Fairvale
for a couple of hours.

12:29.081 --> 12:31.833
Ah. The famous
silent drape runners.

12:32.001 --> 12:34.335
She's already spending the millions.

12:34.503 --> 12:36.921
Well, I have to put gas in my car
like everyone else, right?

12:37.089 --> 12:38.798
You bet.

12:40.092 --> 12:45.013
I didn't wanna tell you on the phone,
but Hank got his parole.

12:46.891 --> 12:48.600
Okay.

12:49.143 --> 12:52.520
He'll be coming home. I mean, back.

12:52.688 --> 12:55.607
I only saw him
a minute before the hearing.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.984
He seemed so hopeful.

12:58.152 --> 13:00.528
I didn't wanna say anything.

13:00.696 --> 13:01.863
You don't have to explain.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.865
Have you said anything
to Nadine yet?

13:05.284 --> 13:06.326
Haven't yet.

13:08.078 --> 13:09.329
Waiting for me to go first?

13:09.497 --> 13:10.872
No.

13:11.040 --> 13:15.376
It's just that, uh, Nadine's not well.

13:17.838 --> 13:19.172
What are you saying?

13:20.216 --> 13:21.216
I don't know.

13:23.552 --> 13:25.512
I think I do.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.306
I don't ever wanna hurt you, babe.

13:28.474 --> 13:31.142
Maybe that's our trouble, Ed.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.645
We never wanna hurt anyone.

13:33.813 --> 13:36.231
We never just take what we want.

13:37.274 --> 13:39.067
There's a part of me
that's beginning to think

13:39.235 --> 13:42.403
that this is how it is
when you get to the end of your life

13:42.571 --> 13:44.531
and that you don't have anything
to show for it.

13:45.324 --> 13:46.991
Norma.

13:49.954 --> 13:53.915
Don't call me.
I mean, not for a while, okay?

13:56.168 --> 13:57.168
Okay.

13:59.255 --> 14:00.713
I love you, Ed.

14:18.941 --> 14:22.068
I can remember
when you were just a little girl.

14:22.236 --> 14:23.903
So did my father speak to you?

14:24.071 --> 14:25.572
Yes, yes, he did.

14:25.739 --> 14:30.118
And I can't tell you how excited we are
to have you come onboard

14:30.286 --> 14:32.787
and put in a hitch with us
down here at our flagship.

14:32.955 --> 14:34.914
So, what did you have in mind
for me?

14:35.082 --> 14:37.667
Well, Audrey,
as per your father's suggestion,

14:37.835 --> 14:40.128
starting low, aiming high, et cetera,

14:40.296 --> 14:43.214
we thought perhaps
the Wrapping Department,

14:43.382 --> 14:46.217
gifts, et cetera.
Part-time, after school.

14:46.385 --> 14:49.470
No, no, no.

14:49.638 --> 14:53.641
Emory, may I speak frankly?

14:53.809 --> 14:56.144
Oh, please do.

14:57.229 --> 15:02.066
Let's talk retail.

15:02.234 --> 15:03.484
Sales?

15:03.652 --> 15:05.320
Perfume.

15:06.071 --> 15:08.323
One of our more, uh,
sensitive areas.

15:08.490 --> 15:11.034
Expensive items,
delicate customer relations.

15:11.201 --> 15:13.036
I'm afraid I've got my heart
set on it, Emory.

15:13.203 --> 15:15.955
Heh. I'd have to talk to your father.

15:16.123 --> 15:18.166
Emory, here's what we're gonna do.

15:18.334 --> 15:19.959
You're gonna tell my father

15:20.127 --> 15:22.754
that I'm busy as a bee
wrapping boxes with the drones.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.839
Then you're gonna put me to work
this afternoon

15:25.007 --> 15:26.466
behind the perfume counter,

15:26.634 --> 15:29.552
because if you don't,
I'm gonna rip my dress in half

15:29.720 --> 15:31.262
and scream at the top of my lungs

15:31.430 --> 15:34.599
and tell my father
that you made a pass at me.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.226
Does that help
to clear things up for you?

15:39.021 --> 15:40.480
Yes.

15:41.690 --> 15:43.191
Yes, what?

15:46.195 --> 15:47.612
Yes, Miss Horne.

15:57.665 --> 15:59.666
Shall we get started
on the paperwork?

16:07.049 --> 16:10.468
James. I got your note.

16:12.388 --> 16:13.596
Are you all right?

16:13.764 --> 16:16.557
Donna,
there's some things I gotta say.

16:16.725 --> 16:19.352
I told you
that my dad died when I was 10.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.521
He didn't die.

16:23.899 --> 16:26.401
He was a musician.
We were living on the West Coast.

16:26.568 --> 16:28.361
He was a bum,
and he ran off on me and my mom.

16:28.529 --> 16:30.405
I'm sorry.

16:30.572 --> 16:31.739
My mom was a writer.

16:31.907 --> 16:35.410
She was really good.
Poems and short stories.

16:36.704 --> 16:39.038
She's an alcoholic.

16:39.748 --> 16:42.333
If you have a problem with this,
I know you didn't ask to hear it.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.919
I don't have a problem. You tell me.

16:46.714 --> 16:52.135
It's true she was out of town this week,
but she wasn't traveling.

16:53.595 --> 16:56.764
What she does
is she goes to another town,

16:56.932 --> 16:59.517
shacks up in some cheap hotel
with a couple of bottles

16:59.685 --> 17:03.771
and picks up guys and...

17:12.906 --> 17:14.741
It's all right.

17:16.368 --> 17:19.454
I'm telling you this because I don't
wanna have any secrets from you.

17:19.621 --> 17:22.623
I don't want there to be any lies
between us.

17:22.958 --> 17:24.083
It's the secrets people keep

17:24.251 --> 17:26.085
that destroy any chance they have
of happiness,

17:26.253 --> 17:27.670
and I don't want us to be like that.

17:27.838 --> 17:30.298
We won't. We won't be.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.972
We have to do what's right.

17:39.141 --> 17:41.517
What you said yesterday was true.

17:41.685 --> 17:44.645
If we don't do everything we can
to figure out what happened to Laura,

17:44.813 --> 17:46.647
it'll never go away our whole lives.

17:46.815 --> 17:49.192
We will, James.

17:51.820 --> 17:54.238
She's out there,
wandering like a restless spirit.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.491
I feel it too.

17:56.658 --> 17:57.825
We owe it to her.

17:57.993 --> 18:00.495
At least they're fresh.
Here you go, Gary.

18:00.662 --> 18:02.455
Oh, thanks.

18:03.248 --> 18:06.000
- Here you go, Scott.
- Thank you.

18:09.421 --> 18:11.047
There you are.

18:11.423 --> 18:12.965
What do you wanna mark this?

18:13.133 --> 18:15.551
Mark it duplicate.
Do we have one like it?

18:15.719 --> 18:18.304
Yeah, the same stain.
We had it before.

18:18.472 --> 18:20.181
Mark it duplicate.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.811
Hmm. Red drapes.

18:24.978 --> 18:28.940
That PO Box was registered
to Jacques Renault.

18:29.108 --> 18:32.568
Those are the letters responding
to Ronette's ad in the magazine.

18:32.736 --> 18:35.571
Let's see if there's something
from someone we know.

18:36.448 --> 18:38.241
Hawk, hand me that magazine,
would you?

18:38.408 --> 18:39.450
What is it?

18:39.618 --> 18:42.954
Two different ad numbers mailed
to the same post office address.

18:43.122 --> 18:46.499
Ronette's and one other.

18:48.085 --> 18:50.545
Yeah, here it is.

18:51.004 --> 18:53.131
"Young student requires education
in the ways of love.

18:53.298 --> 18:56.300
Only generous mature men
need apply."

18:57.136 --> 18:58.886
It's Laura.

19:00.472 --> 19:02.974
You see some identifying mark?

19:03.142 --> 19:06.561
- The drapes.
- Drapes?

19:10.315 --> 19:12.233
Red drapes, Harry, from my dream.

19:18.073 --> 19:19.949
Now, why would an apartment dweller
like Jacques

19:20.117 --> 19:22.076
buy 50 gallons of heating oil?

19:22.244 --> 19:23.619
Yeah, yeah, I already got it.

19:23.787 --> 19:24.996
To heat a log cabin.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.414
Harry, you're all right.

19:26.582 --> 19:29.750
Jacques' brother said something
about a place up near the state line.

19:29.918 --> 19:33.546
Fellas, let's pack a lunch.
We're taking a walk in the woods.

19:42.347 --> 19:43.890
Madeleine.

19:44.057 --> 19:46.100
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.769
Hi. I'm Madeleine Ferguson.

19:48.937 --> 19:51.355
My friends call me Maddy.

19:51.523 --> 19:53.733
This is really nice of you guys.

19:53.901 --> 19:58.529
I don't really know anybody in town
except Aunt Sarah and Uncle Leland.

19:58.697 --> 20:01.282
And the mood at the house,
you can probably guess,

20:01.450 --> 20:03.284
isn't that great right now.

20:03.452 --> 20:04.952
Would you like something to drink?

20:05.120 --> 20:06.746
A cherry Coke would be great.

20:06.914 --> 20:08.581
You got it.

20:11.293 --> 20:12.752
Madeleine.

20:13.378 --> 20:17.173
If I said that you can't really say
a word of this to anyone, not a soul,

20:17.341 --> 20:19.759
not even your aunt or uncle,
would that be okay with you?

20:19.927 --> 20:21.761
It sounds like some big secret.

20:21.929 --> 20:22.929
It is.

20:23.096 --> 20:26.015
James and I knew Laura
better than anyone did.

20:26.183 --> 20:28.559
She was in some kind
of terrible trouble before she died,

20:28.727 --> 20:30.311
worse than any of us could imagine.

20:30.479 --> 20:32.188
What?

20:32.356 --> 20:35.566
Well, I'd rather not say too much
about things we can't prove yet.

20:37.569 --> 20:40.321
You said you can't prove it yet.

20:40.489 --> 20:42.156
We loved Laura.

20:42.324 --> 20:44.325
We're afraid that the truth
might never come out

20:44.493 --> 20:47.578
or that the person who killed her
might never be caught.

20:47.746 --> 20:49.914
We've sworn on her memory
not to let that happen.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.166
My God. You know who did it?

20:52.334 --> 20:53.459
We have some ideas.

20:53.627 --> 20:56.087
We wanted to talk to you about this
because we need your help.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.838
What do you want me to do?

20:58.674 --> 21:01.550
Laura used to talk about
a secret hiding place she had

21:01.718 --> 21:03.594
somewhere in her house,
maybe in her room.

21:03.762 --> 21:06.847
I'm not really sure.
But nobody else knew about it.

21:07.015 --> 21:08.724
We think she might have
left something there

21:08.892 --> 21:10.268
that could lead us to the killer.

21:13.146 --> 21:14.146
I'll help you.

21:14.314 --> 21:16.107
You will?

21:16.692 --> 21:18.025
The day before she died,

21:18.735 --> 21:22.196
I had a feeling
that Laura was in trouble.

21:23.532 --> 21:26.117
I've always felt close to her.
That's why I came here.

21:27.953 --> 21:32.123
You know,
I didn't really know Laura that well,

21:32.291 --> 21:34.041
but I feel like I do.

21:34.209 --> 21:37.712
Our folks were always telling us
how much alike we were.

21:37.879 --> 21:40.840
Will you call me
if there's anything I can do?

21:41.008 --> 21:43.301
I don't think there'll be any problem.

21:43.468 --> 21:46.512
This is really great.

21:46.680 --> 21:48.639
Call me Maddy.

21:54.771 --> 21:56.605
- Hi.
- Hi, Norma.

21:56.773 --> 21:59.400
We look like a couple
of refugee beauty queens.

21:59.568 --> 22:01.402
You don't know how really
good-looking you are.

22:01.570 --> 22:02.611
I never felt so glamorous.

22:02.779 --> 22:04.905
Hope I don't chip a nail
slinging plates around.

22:05.073 --> 22:06.073
Hi, Norma.

22:06.241 --> 22:07.325
Hello, Hank.

22:07.492 --> 22:08.743
Surprised to see me, huh?

22:09.828 --> 22:11.078
Yes.

22:15.751 --> 22:16.751
Is that Leo's girlfriend?

22:17.961 --> 22:19.086
Wife.

22:19.254 --> 22:21.672
That Leo. So impulsive.

22:21.840 --> 22:24.258
Not much meat on her, though.

22:25.218 --> 22:27.928
Hey, I don't expect a kiss
or anything.

22:28.096 --> 22:31.432
I figure I gotta earn my way
back into your heart.

22:32.142 --> 22:36.771
But, Norma, I intend to try.

22:37.522 --> 22:40.191
So where do I start?

22:41.109 --> 22:43.027
Washing dishes will be fine.

22:43.779 --> 22:49.116
Can I finish my coffee first, boss?

22:53.955 --> 22:57.625
Oh, no. Oh, no. No.

22:57.793 --> 23:00.044
You little Froot Loop.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.797
You're done! Done!

23:03.423 --> 23:05.132
Don't ever cross me.

23:09.721 --> 23:13.557
Tune in tomorrow for Invitation to Love.

23:20.023 --> 23:23.150
He's been spending more and more
of his time alone in his room.

23:23.318 --> 23:26.320
It's become much more difficult
to engage him in conversation.

23:26.488 --> 23:27.947
Terrible mood swings.

23:28.115 --> 23:31.367
We've been told by the school that his
attendance has become erratic at best.

23:31.535 --> 23:33.369
And then there's the matter
of public fighting,

23:33.537 --> 23:35.663
both at the Roadhouse
and at the funeral.

23:35.831 --> 23:37.415
Are you using drugs, Bobby?

23:37.582 --> 23:38.582
Nope.

23:38.750 --> 23:40.042
- Alcohol.
- Alcohol's a drug.

23:40.210 --> 23:42.586
- Well, that's not what he meant.
- Alcohol doesn't count?

23:42.754 --> 23:44.463
Everybody drinks.

23:44.631 --> 23:45.840
Are you unhappy, Bobby?

23:46.007 --> 23:47.174
Shouldn't I be?

23:48.051 --> 23:50.094
Well, that's not for me to say.

23:50.262 --> 23:52.513
Have you ever killed anybody?

23:52.681 --> 23:54.598
- Have you?
- My father has.

23:54.766 --> 23:56.600
- During wartime.
- That's different.

23:56.768 --> 23:58.352
Different from what?

23:58.520 --> 24:01.522
Perhaps I should spend
a few minutes with Bobby alone.

24:01.690 --> 24:03.524
This is supposed to be
family counseling.

24:04.651 --> 24:07.736
Well, and I'll need to spend some time
with each member of the family alone,

24:07.904 --> 24:10.364
but Bobby first.

24:10.532 --> 24:12.366
- Fair enough.
- Whatever you say.

24:29.426 --> 24:31.927
Bobby, let's just cut the crap, huh?

24:32.095 --> 24:33.554
Okay, so your parents
don't understand

24:33.722 --> 24:35.222
what you're going through right now.

24:35.390 --> 24:38.517
Heh. That's a good one.

24:38.685 --> 24:40.728
Let's talk about Laura.

24:40.896 --> 24:42.771
Okay. Let's talk about Laura.

24:42.939 --> 24:45.483
Bobby, what happened the first time

24:45.650 --> 24:48.402
that you and Laura made love?

24:50.322 --> 24:53.032
What the hell kind of question
is that?

24:54.242 --> 24:57.453
Bobby, did you cry?

24:58.747 --> 25:00.748
Did I what?

25:02.501 --> 25:05.836
And then what did Laura do?
Did she laugh at you?

25:19.893 --> 25:22.603
Were you very sad
when Laura died?

25:24.314 --> 25:27.858
- Laura wanted to die.
- How do you know that?

25:34.574 --> 25:37.284
Because she told me.

25:38.787 --> 25:40.955
What else did she tell you?

25:43.291 --> 25:46.835
Did she tell you
there was no goodness in the world?

25:48.964 --> 25:54.134
She said people tried to be good,

25:54.302 --> 25:59.306
but they were really sick and rotten,
her most of all.

25:59.474 --> 26:04.395
And every time she tried to make
the world a better place,

26:05.146 --> 26:07.147
something terrible came up
inside her

26:07.315 --> 26:11.277
and pulled her back down into hell.

26:11.444 --> 26:16.699
It took her deeper and deeper
into the blackest nightmare.

26:17.117 --> 26:20.160
And every time, it got harder
to go back up to the light.

26:20.328 --> 26:22.121
Did you sometimes have the feeling

26:22.289 --> 26:26.667
that Laura was harboring
some awful secret?

26:26.835 --> 26:28.335
Yeah.

26:28.503 --> 26:31.589
Bad enough that she wanted to die
because of it?

26:31.756 --> 26:32.756
Yes.

26:32.924 --> 26:35.092
Bad enough that it drove her
to consciously try to find

26:35.260 --> 26:36.844
people's weaknesses
and prey on them,

26:37.012 --> 26:39.847
tempt them, break them down,

26:40.015 --> 26:43.017
make them do terrible,
degrading things?

26:43.184 --> 26:45.603
- Yes.
- Laura wanted to corrupt people.

26:45.770 --> 26:48.188
Because that's how she felt
about herself.

26:48.356 --> 26:49.773
Yes.

26:49.941 --> 26:52.276
Is that what happened to you,
Bobby?

26:54.571 --> 26:55.779
Is that what Laura did to you?

26:57.532 --> 27:00.618
She wanted so much.

27:01.494 --> 27:04.872
She made me sell drugs
so she could have them.

27:36.821 --> 27:39.156
This way. Through here.

27:39.324 --> 27:40.908
Watch your step there, city boy.

27:41.076 --> 27:42.951
Thanks, Harry.

27:54.756 --> 27:56.590
What is it, Hawk?

28:10.522 --> 28:12.231
Is that the cabin we're looking for?

28:12.399 --> 28:15.401
Maybe, maybe not.

28:16.778 --> 28:18.821
You might wanna
hang back a step, doc.

28:18.988 --> 28:21.740
Huh. Might want to, anyway.

28:42.679 --> 28:44.638
About time you got here.

28:46.057 --> 28:49.560
They move so slowly
when they're not afraid.

28:50.478 --> 28:54.815
Come on, then.
My log does not judge.

29:07.996 --> 29:09.496
I've got tea.

29:09.664 --> 29:12.249
I've got cookies. No cake.

29:12.417 --> 29:15.878
Well, that's very kind of you, ma'am,
but I don't believe that...

29:16.504 --> 29:17.504
What kind of cookies?

29:18.715 --> 29:20.507
Sugar.

29:20.675 --> 29:23.552
The owls won't see us in here.

29:25.680 --> 29:28.432
A cup of tea would be very nice.

29:29.851 --> 29:33.479
Shut your eyes
and you'll burst into flames.

29:33.646 --> 29:35.564
Thanks, Margaret.

29:36.316 --> 29:38.650
We'll let it steep.

29:45.700 --> 29:48.494
Wait for the tea.
The fish aren't running.

29:49.871 --> 29:51.747
You've been expecting us,
Margaret?

29:51.915 --> 29:53.373
You're two days late.

29:54.125 --> 29:55.375
But that's your concern.

29:57.921 --> 30:00.297
My log saw something.

30:00.465 --> 30:01.882
Something significant.

30:02.717 --> 30:03.842
What did your log see?

30:05.220 --> 30:08.889
Tea first. Then be ready.

30:13.353 --> 30:14.895
Thank you.

30:16.231 --> 30:19.483
- My husband was a logging man.
- Oh?

30:19.651 --> 30:20.818
He met the devil.

30:21.736 --> 30:25.572
Fire is the devil
hiding like a coward in the smoke.

30:25.740 --> 30:28.534
It was the day after the wedding,
wasn't it, Margaret?

30:30.328 --> 30:33.080
The wood holds many spirits,
doesn't it, Margaret?

30:39.504 --> 30:40.671
You can ask it now.

30:48.429 --> 30:50.806
What did you see that night?

30:50.974 --> 30:52.891
The night Laura Palmer was killed?

30:53.977 --> 30:55.477
Shh.

30:55.645 --> 30:57.813
I'll do the talking.

31:00.275 --> 31:01.900
Dark.

31:02.777 --> 31:04.278
Laughing.

31:04.445 --> 31:06.780
The owls were flying.

31:07.156 --> 31:09.032
Many things were blocked.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.577
Laughing. Two men.

31:12.245 --> 31:14.121
Two girls.

31:14.289 --> 31:19.459
Flashlights pass by in the woods
over the ridge.

31:19.627 --> 31:21.795
The owls were near.

31:21.963 --> 31:25.299
The dark was pressing in on her.

31:26.676 --> 31:28.218
Quiet then.

31:28.386 --> 31:30.470
Later, footsteps.

31:30.638 --> 31:32.556
One man passed by.

31:32.724 --> 31:36.560
Screams far away.

31:37.228 --> 31:41.356
Terrible. Terrible.

31:41.816 --> 31:42.983
One voice.

31:43.151 --> 31:46.236
- Man or girl?
- Girl.

31:47.572 --> 31:50.782
Further up. Over the ridge.

31:51.451 --> 31:53.493
The owls were silent.

32:03.922 --> 32:07.215
The two girls
were Laura and Ronette.

32:07.383 --> 32:11.929
The two men, Jacques, maybe Leo.

32:12.096 --> 32:13.639
Maybe.

32:14.599 --> 32:16.224
Who's the third man?

32:19.270 --> 32:20.896
Do you hear it?

32:22.899 --> 32:24.441
This way.

33:35.888 --> 33:38.265
And there's always music in the air.

33:40.852 --> 33:42.602
Waldo.

33:43.354 --> 33:45.355
There's film in here.

33:50.945 --> 33:52.988
Blood.

34:14.802 --> 34:16.970
One-Eyed Jack's.

34:38.618 --> 34:40.243
Evening, Mr. and Mrs. Showel.

34:40.411 --> 34:42.329
- Okay. Go right ahead.
- Thank you.

34:42.497 --> 34:43.747
Good evening.

34:43.915 --> 34:47.417
- Catherine Martell and spouse.
- Mm-hm.

34:50.546 --> 34:54.591
Go easy on the sauce tonight,
okay, Cathy?

34:59.138 --> 35:02.849
Couple of belts and even you
might start to look good to me.

35:18.032 --> 35:20.158
Of course,
the modern age has changed forever

35:20.326 --> 35:21.785
the way your people live,
Mr. Thorson.

35:21.953 --> 35:23.870
But it would be my guess
that there still remains

35:24.038 --> 35:25.622
a tremendous vestigial interest

35:25.790 --> 35:28.041
in the legends and folklore
of ancient Iceland.

35:28.209 --> 35:30.710
Vestigial. Absolutely.

35:30.878 --> 35:33.505
Heba, did you know that was
an American figure of speech?

35:33.673 --> 35:35.006
No, Jerry. Ha, ha.

35:35.174 --> 35:38.385
Heba, Heba.
You never heard that before?

35:38.553 --> 35:40.303
No, Jerry. Ha-ha-ha.

35:50.731 --> 35:53.775
Do you realize the incredible potential
that could result

35:53.943 --> 35:59.281
from our taking a mutual dip
in each other's respective gene pools?

36:01.200 --> 36:04.744
Heba, I wanna cook for you.

36:06.122 --> 36:08.832
Very, very good. That's funny.

36:09.000 --> 36:14.880
So he says, "What do you get when
you cross a Norwegian with a Swede?

36:15.047 --> 36:17.007
A socialist who wants to be king."

36:19.343 --> 36:21.845
Well, I can remember it was,
I think, oh, somewhere in the '50s,

36:23.181 --> 36:26.183
I came through your country.
Beautiful, beautiful.

36:26.350 --> 36:29.269
Not many trees, though,
you know, but...

36:33.107 --> 36:34.357
Hmm.

36:37.028 --> 36:38.361
Would you excuse me?

36:38.529 --> 36:40.697
Of course.

36:40.865 --> 36:44.326
Meet me in my office.
Give me two minutes to break away.

36:44.493 --> 36:47.621
- Hell hath no fury.
- What?

36:48.789 --> 36:50.457
Two minutes.

36:50.625 --> 36:54.336
Ah, Thor,
I've been meaning to ask you,

36:54.503 --> 36:57.464
are you familiar
with the word luhamsta?

37:18.736 --> 37:23.490
Catherine, we agreed,
no scenes in front of the guests.

37:23.658 --> 37:26.243
Let's keep the melodrama
to a minimum.

37:26.410 --> 37:30.247
The next thing I know, you're polishing
my shoes with Dom Pérignon.

37:30.414 --> 37:33.500
Fill me in. What's eating you?

37:36.754 --> 37:38.797
Why did you have this
thousand-dollar poker chip

37:38.965 --> 37:41.716
from you-know-where
in your pants yesterday?

37:41.884 --> 37:44.844
I thought you preferred women
with certain experience.

37:45.012 --> 37:46.846
Hmm.

37:47.014 --> 37:49.099
Jerry gave me that.

37:50.685 --> 37:51.685
It's a good-luck charm.

37:51.852 --> 37:55.855
I thought I'd lost it.
I'm so relieved that you found it.

37:59.443 --> 38:00.485
Are you quite finished?

38:05.366 --> 38:06.992
Yes.

38:07.368 --> 38:09.160
In that case...

38:16.377 --> 38:19.212
Oh. Let's burn the mill.

38:19.380 --> 38:20.755
Let's do it tonight.

38:20.923 --> 38:22.549
No, my love.

38:22.717 --> 38:24.926
We'll give Josie
one last chance to sell.

38:25.094 --> 38:26.094
Tomorrow.

38:26.262 --> 38:31.474
Failing that,
I have retained the services

38:31.642 --> 38:33.977
of a qualified professional.

38:35.730 --> 38:36.730
Breath mint?

38:52.288 --> 38:55.832
Now, let me get this straight.

38:57.251 --> 39:03.048
Your entire country
is above the timberline?

39:03.215 --> 39:06.009
Folks, ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention, please?

39:06.177 --> 39:07.177
Can I have your attention?

39:08.929 --> 39:12.265
Heh. First off, I wanna thank you all
for turning out

39:12.433 --> 39:16.478
to welcome our neighbors
from the magical isle of Iceland.

39:21.233 --> 39:23.526
We are all Icelanders.

39:27.281 --> 39:28.990
The Ghostwood Estates project

39:29.158 --> 39:31.284
is an important part of our future
here in Twin Peaks,

39:31.452 --> 39:34.162
and there's no one we'd rather have
as partners in our future than...

39:36.665 --> 39:38.249
What...?

39:54.725 --> 39:56.267
Dance with him.

39:56.435 --> 39:58.478
It is serious. Dance with him.

40:08.614 --> 40:09.614
All right.

40:12.910 --> 40:15.662
Jerry, what's going on?

40:16.831 --> 40:20.834
Get Jacoby, get a net,
but get him out of my life.

40:31.178 --> 40:32.720
What are they doing?

40:34.640 --> 40:36.516
Jerry. Jerry.

40:41.355 --> 40:43.148
Gather round.

41:34.325 --> 41:36.075
Donna? It's Maddy.

41:36.243 --> 41:38.036
I was looking in Laura's room
and I remembered

41:38.204 --> 41:41.581
when we were younger, she used
to hide cigarettes in her bedpost.

41:41.749 --> 41:45.001
The top of one of the posts
screws off.

41:45.669 --> 41:47.754
I found a tape in her hiding place.

41:47.922 --> 41:49.547
Leland? Where did you go?

41:49.715 --> 41:52.300
I'll meet you and James tomorrow.

41:52.468 --> 41:55.929
- Okay. And bring a tape recorder.
- Leland?

42:32.216 --> 42:35.176
Did anyone see you come in here?

42:35.344 --> 42:36.719
No.

42:37.346 --> 42:42.767
You do realize the risk
if anyone sees us.

42:43.644 --> 42:47.647
This was hidden in her desk
where you said it would be.

42:52.111 --> 42:55.321
- Then we can proceed.
- When?

42:58.826 --> 43:00.827
Tomorrow night.

43:50.711 --> 43:54.172
Over here. Told you to mind the store,
Leo, not open your own franchise.

43:54.340 --> 43:57.050
- Hank, I...
- Do as you're told, Leo.

43:57.217 --> 44:01.220
Next time, you'll watch me take
your little chippy apart before I kill you.

44:07.811 --> 44:08.811
Get me a beer, Shelly.

44:08.979 --> 44:10.647
Honey, what happened?
Are you okay?

44:10.814 --> 44:12.732
- Just get me a damn beer!
- Aah!

44:15.152 --> 44:17.236
Get up and...

44:18.405 --> 44:19.906
What the hell are you doing
with that?

44:20.074 --> 44:22.033
You're not gonna hurt me again.

44:22.201 --> 44:24.911
Don't touch me.
Don't come near me, Leo.

44:25.079 --> 44:27.246
You stupid little slut.

44:28.582 --> 44:30.249
You haven't got the guts.

45:14.753 --> 45:16.796
Reach over and turn on the light.

45:22.886 --> 45:24.804
Don't make me leave.

45:26.181 --> 46:26.949
Please, don't make me leave.
