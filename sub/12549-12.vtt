WEBVTT

00:01.632 --> 00:03.104
(Rico) PEOPLE USED TO DESCRIBE
GREEN GROVE

00:03.104 --> 00:04.405
AS A GREAT PLACE TO GROW UP.

00:04.405 --> 00:06.337
(Jo and Lacey giggling)

00:06.337 --> 00:08.539
BUT THAT WAS BEFORE DANNY DESAI
WAS SENT AWAY FOR MURDER...

00:08.539 --> 00:09.740
DUDE!

00:09.740 --> 00:12.413
I HAD TO.
I DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE.

00:12.413 --> 00:13.684
AND MESSED UP
HIS TWO BEST FRIENDS

00:13.684 --> 00:15.046
IN THE PROCESS.

00:15.046 --> 00:17.048
PLEASE, DON'T HATE ME.

00:20.051 --> 00:21.352
(gasps)

00:21.352 --> 00:23.124
FIVE YEARS LATER,
HE CAME BACK...

00:23.124 --> 00:24.795
(woman on TV) DESAI'S RETURN
TO GREEN GROVE HIGH

00:24.795 --> 00:26.227
HAS BEEN MET WITH CONTROVERSY.

00:26.227 --> 00:27.698
BOO.

00:27.698 --> 00:30.030
(Rico) TO A PLACE
THAT DIDN'T WANT HIM.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.703
I WOULDN'T LET THAT SOCIO
ANYWHERE NEAR MY SCHOOL.

00:32.703 --> 00:34.765
SOCIO.
SOCIO.

00:34.765 --> 00:37.508
"SOCIO"--IT'S, UH,
IT'S KINDA CATCHY, ACTUALLY.

00:37.508 --> 00:40.571
PAGING DR. LECTER,
YOUR SPAWN IS LOOSE ON AISLE 4.

00:40.571 --> 00:42.713
I'D LET HIM LOOSE
ON

00:42.713 --> 00:45.446
(Rico) BUT WHEN TROUBLE
FOLLOWED HIM HOME...

00:45.446 --> 00:47.218
(woman) AAH!

00:47.218 --> 00:48.579
(Kyle) WE WILL USE
EVERY RESOURCE AT OUR DISPOSAL,

00:48.579 --> 00:50.421
BUT WE HAVE NO SUSPECTS
AT THIS TIME.

00:50.421 --> 00:52.483
(Rico) DANNY'S HISTORY
LEFT HIM OPEN TO SUSPICION.

00:52.483 --> 00:53.684
(Kyle) WE'D LIKE YOU TO
COME WITH US, DANNY.

00:53.684 --> 00:55.186
WE NEED TO ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS.

00:55.186 --> 00:57.088
MY GUT'S TELLING ME
HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

00:57.088 --> 00:59.160
SOMEONE HAS TO GIVE HIM
THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.531
(students) OOH!

01:00.531 --> 01:02.393
LIFELONG FRIENDSHIPS
WERE TESTED...

01:02.393 --> 01:04.465
IF YOU WANT OUR HELP, YOU HAVE
TO STOP HIDING THINGS FROM US.

01:04.465 --> 01:06.066
AND PRESENT-DAY MYSTERIES...

01:06.066 --> 01:07.838
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHO SENT THIS.

01:07.838 --> 01:09.600
REVEALED SECRETS FROM THE PAST.

01:09.600 --> 01:11.602
OH, MY GOD.

01:11.602 --> 01:13.344
WHAT IF HIS REASON
FOR KILLING HIS AUNT

01:13.344 --> 01:15.776
IS SOMEHOW CONNECTED
TO WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?

01:15.776 --> 01:18.449
AND NOW WHAT EVERYBODY WANTS
TO KNOW IS...

01:18.449 --> 01:20.251
YOU'RE WONDERING IF
I'M MIMICKING HUMAN EMOTION,

01:20.251 --> 01:21.652
AREN'T YOU?
NO.

01:21.652 --> 01:23.754
WHO IS DANNY DESAI?

01:23.754 --> 01:25.216
WHY DO YOU TRUST HIM?
A SINNER...

01:25.216 --> 01:26.657
ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANNA HELP ME?

01:26.657 --> 01:27.788
OR A SAINT?

01:27.788 --> 01:29.620
I THINK
I'M IN LOVE WITH HIM.

01:29.620 --> 01:32.092
A VICTIM...
GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!

01:32.092 --> 01:34.495
OR EVERYTHING
WE ALL THOUGHT HE WAS?

01:35.526 --> 01:37.168
OH, MY GOD!
THAT WAS TENSE.

01:37.168 --> 01:44.805
I FEEL LIKE I JUST LIVED THROUGH
A HITCHCOCK MOVIE.

01:44.805 --> 01:49.340
♪♪♪

01:49.340 --> 01:50.811
EVERYTHING I'VE LEARNED
ABOUT DANNY

01:50.811 --> 01:52.183
STARTED ON THAT
SUPER INTENSE DAY AT SCHOOL.

01:52.183 --> 01:53.544
HEY, JO!

01:53.544 --> 01:55.286
THAT'S ME THERE.

01:55.286 --> 01:57.688
HEY, YOU READY FOR TODAY?
IT'S GONNA BE A TOUGH ONE.

01:57.688 --> 01:59.550
YEAH. WELL AWARE, RICO.
TRUST ME.

01:59.550 --> 02:01.121
YEAH, I PREPPED ALL NIGHT.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.524
MY MOM HAD TO MAKE ME, LIKE,
THREE ESPRESSO SHOTS.

02:03.524 --> 02:05.756
OKAY, WHAT ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT?

02:05.756 --> 02:07.558
OUR PRECALCULUS QUIZ.

02:07.558 --> 02:09.300
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

02:09.300 --> 02:10.901
DANNY DESAI.

02:10.901 --> 02:13.464
THE MURDERER. JUMP ROPE.

02:13.464 --> 02:15.406
DEAD AUNT. TOWN SCANDAL.

02:15.406 --> 02:17.608
UH, YEAH, I'M NOT--
I'M NOT FAMILIAR.

02:17.608 --> 02:21.842
AND THAT BRINGS US
TO LESSON 1--

02:21.842 --> 02:25.476
"KNOW YOUR SOCIO."

02:25.476 --> 02:27.578
IT ALL BEGAN FIVE YEARS AGO
WITH THREE FRIENDS...

02:27.578 --> 02:30.181
HE'S BEEN ACTING SO STRANGE
LATELY.

02:30.181 --> 02:31.722
AND A RED JUMP ROPE...

02:31.722 --> 02:33.724
THAT WASN'T USED FOR JUMPING.

02:33.724 --> 02:34.855
LACEY.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.527
DUDE!

02:36.527 --> 02:38.329
WHAT WAS THAT?

02:38.329 --> 02:41.492
DANNY, ARE YOU OKAY?

02:41.492 --> 02:43.764
I DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE.

02:45.866 --> 02:49.300
PLEASE, DON'T HATE ME.

02:49.300 --> 02:52.643
FIVE YEARS LATER,
DANNY WAS COMING BACK HOME.

02:52.643 --> 02:54.205
(woman on TV)
HE WAS RELEASED YESTERDAY

02:54.205 --> 02:56.377
FROM THE JUVENILE DETENTION
FACILITY

02:56.377 --> 02:58.509
THAT HAS HELD HIM
FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS

02:58.509 --> 02:59.950
SINCE HE STRANGLED HIS AUNT.

02:59.950 --> 03:02.182
(Rico) EVERYONE WAS ON EDGE,

03:02.182 --> 03:04.255
ESPECIALLY HIS OLD FRIENDS.

03:04.255 --> 03:06.186
I'LL FEEL LESS TENSE
ONCE I SEE THAT LUNATIC FREAK

03:06.186 --> 03:07.788
AND TELL HIM I HATE HIS GUTS.

03:07.788 --> 03:10.591
(Lacey) THAT MOMENT I FIRST
SAW HER JUST LYING THERE

03:10.591 --> 03:13.193
IS ETCHED IN MY BRAIN.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.865
I DON'T LIKE THINKING
ABOUT THAT DAY.

03:14.865 --> 03:18.299
MAYBE IT'S TIME
YOU REACH OUT TO HER AGAIN.

03:18.299 --> 03:20.501
THIS IS SOMETHING ONLY
THE TWO OF YOU HAVE IN COMMON.

03:20.501 --> 03:23.274
LACEY AND I HAVE NOTHING
IN COMMON.

03:23.274 --> 03:25.536
(Rico) THEY REALLY DIDN'T.

03:25.536 --> 03:27.238
AFTER
THE DANNY DE-PSYCHO INCIDENT,

03:27.238 --> 03:29.209
THEY TOOK WAY DIFFERENT PATHS.

03:29.209 --> 03:33.944
JO BECAME THIS AWESOME, FUNNY,
SUPER AMAZING, SMART GIRL,

03:33.944 --> 03:35.946
MY STUDY BUDDY AND BEST FRIEND,

03:35.946 --> 03:37.648
AND LACEY JUST GOT POPULAR

03:37.648 --> 03:40.291
AND, YOU KNOW,
PARTIED WITH OTHER POPULAR KIDS

03:40.291 --> 03:41.822
AND DATED A POPULAR JOCK

03:41.822 --> 03:43.994
AND DID ALL SORTS
OF OTHER POPULAR-Y THINGS.

03:43.994 --> 03:46.557
BUT THE RETURN OF DANNY DESAI

03:46.557 --> 03:49.260
FORCED THE EX-B.F.F.s
BACK TOGETHER...

03:49.260 --> 03:49.960
HEY.

03:49.960 --> 03:52.703
LIKE IT OR NOT.

03:52.703 --> 03:53.934
HOW YOU HOLDING UP?

03:53.934 --> 03:55.636
UH, OKAY.

03:55.636 --> 03:57.237
ME AND MY FRIENDS ARE HAVING
A PARTY TONIGHT.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.639
WE THOUGHT
WE'D THROW A LITTLE

03:58.639 --> 03:59.940
"MICHAEL MYERS
GOES TO OUR SCHOOL NOW,

03:59.940 --> 04:02.973
LET'S BLOW OFF SOME STEAM"
SORT OF... SHINDIG.

04:02.973 --> 04:04.715
IF YOU WANNA GO, YOU CAN.

04:04.715 --> 04:07.318
DON'T DO ME ANY FAVORS.
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

04:07.318 --> 04:08.479
LOOK, IT'S NOT LIKE
I LIE AROUND,

04:08.479 --> 04:09.850
WISHING I CAN HANG WITH YOU

04:09.850 --> 04:11.952
AND YOUR LAME,
SUPERFICIAL FRIENDS ANYWAY.

04:11.952 --> 04:13.654
SO THAT WENT WELL.

04:13.654 --> 04:15.886
(boy) THERE'S DANNY.
(girl) WHERE?

04:17.958 --> 04:21.031
AND THEN, JUST LIKE THAT,

04:21.031 --> 04:22.963
THERE HE WAS.

04:26.597 --> 04:29.300
BOO.

04:29.300 --> 04:31.972
I'M SORRY. (chuckles) I'M SORRY.
I WAS--I WAS JUST JOKING.

04:31.972 --> 04:34.044
HOW ARE YOU GUYS?

04:35.045 --> 04:38.649
MR. DESAI?
COME WITH ME, PLEASE.

04:38.649 --> 04:40.851
DANNY'S MOM KAREN DESAI,

04:40.851 --> 04:43.314
A RECENT WIDOW AFTER
DANNY'S DAD VIKRAM DIED...

04:43.314 --> 04:44.655
(woman on TV) ...FELL OFF
A COMPANY YACHT

04:44.655 --> 04:46.016
WHILE INTOXICATED.

04:46.016 --> 04:47.658
(Rico) WAS DOING
EVERYTHING SHE COULD

04:47.658 --> 04:49.059
TO HELP DANNY BLEND BACK IN.

04:49.059 --> 04:52.523
PRINCIPAL TANG, MY DANNY'S
A VERY SOCIAL BOY.

04:52.523 --> 04:54.525
ONCE EVERYONE GETS USED TO
HAVING HIM BACK,

04:54.525 --> 04:56.527
THINGS WILL RETURN
BACK TO NORMAL.

04:56.527 --> 04:59.770
(Mrs. Fisk) DANNY DESAI, YOU'VE
BEEN IN MY CLASSROOM TEN MINUTES

04:59.770 --> 05:01.031
AND YOU ALREADY APPEAR TO BE

05:01.031 --> 05:03.734
THE MOST INTERESTING THING
ABOUT IT.

05:03.734 --> 05:05.976
NONE OF US HAVE SEEN
A REAL PSYCHO BEFORE, SO...

05:05.976 --> 05:07.678
SO MUCH FOR NORMAL.

05:07.678 --> 05:10.581
MR. DESAI,
I HEAR FROM MY SOURCES

05:10.581 --> 05:13.013
THAT YOUR NICKNAME
ON THE TWITTER

05:13.013 --> 05:13.984
IS "THE SOCIO."

05:13.984 --> 05:15.886
IS IT?

05:15.886 --> 05:18.989
MRS. FISK, HOW CAN YOU TELL
IF SOMEONE'S A SOCIOPATH?

05:18.989 --> 05:20.821
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T...

05:20.821 --> 05:22.092
YOU CAN'T READ SOMEONE'S MIND.

05:22.092 --> 05:25.996
ALTHOUGH SOCIOPATHS LACK
A REAL HUMAN EMOTION,

05:25.996 --> 05:28.799
THEY ARE DAMN CLEVER
AT MIMICKING THEM.

05:28.799 --> 05:31.101
(Danny) CAN WE CHAT?

05:31.101 --> 05:32.703
FINE, DANNY, LET'S CHAT.

05:32.703 --> 05:34.905
WHAT SHOULD WE--WHAT SHOULD
WE CHAT ABOUT FIRST?

05:34.905 --> 05:37.368
I KNOW. HOW ABOUT
MY LOST CHILDHOOD?

05:37.368 --> 05:40.340
JO, PLEASE. IT'S ME.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.112
I'M STILL THE SAME BOY
YOU GREW UP WITH,

05:42.112 --> 05:43.814
NOT SOME PSYCHO.

05:43.814 --> 05:46.076
LOOK, I KNOW YOU WERE NEVER
A BIG AUNT TARA FAN...

05:46.076 --> 05:48.018
SO WHAT, DID SHE DO SOMETHING
TO YOU?

05:48.018 --> 05:49.079
IF YOU HAD AN ACTUAL REASON,

05:49.079 --> 05:50.881
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL IT
TO THE POLICE?

05:50.881 --> 05:52.082
BECAUSE I COULDN'T.

05:52.082 --> 05:54.925
I CAN'T TELL THAT
TO ANYONE, EVER.

05:54.925 --> 05:56.126
(school bell rings)

05:56.126 --> 05:57.758
LESSON 2--

05:57.758 --> 06:00.791
"AVOID GIRLS
WITH MYSTERIOUS JEWELRY."

06:00.791 --> 06:02.032
(Lacey) PLEASE TELL ME

06:02.032 --> 06:04.094
YOU DON'T ACTUALLY WANNA
HAVE SEX WITH A KILLER.

06:04.094 --> 06:07.037
I KNOW YOU'RE STILL TRAUMATIZED,
BUT HE WAS 11 WHEN HE DID THAT.

06:07.037 --> 06:08.368
REGINA CRANE WAS THE ONE PERSON

06:08.368 --> 06:11.101
WHO WASN'T FREAKED OUT
BY DANNY.

06:11.101 --> 06:13.404
SOCIO!
THE TOTAL OPPOSITE, ACTUALLY.

06:13.404 --> 06:15.005
COME OVER HERE.

06:15.005 --> 06:18.048
I'M NOT SURE I SHOULD START
RESPONDING TO THAT NICKNAME.

06:18.048 --> 06:21.952
LACEY. I, UH,
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.

06:21.952 --> 06:25.155
I'M REGINA, LACEY'S B.F.F.

06:25.155 --> 06:27.418
I AM THROWING A PARTY

06:28.759 --> 06:29.890
WELL, UH...

06:31.822 --> 06:33.694
WHERE'D YOU GET
THAT NECKLACE?

06:33.694 --> 06:36.767
OH! PAY ATTENTION. THE NECKLACE
IS KIND OF IMPORTANT.

06:36.767 --> 06:39.069
WHY? YOU LIKE IT?

06:41.131 --> 06:42.803
UH, THANKS FOR THE INVITE.

06:42.803 --> 06:44.675
MM.
MAYBE I'LL POP BY.

06:46.977 --> 06:48.078
(whispers) OH!

06:48.078 --> 06:50.140
♪♪♪

06:50.140 --> 06:52.142
OKAY, SO AT REGINA'S PARTY...

06:52.142 --> 06:54.685
SOCIO, YOU CAME!

06:54.685 --> 06:56.447
(chuckles) AND...

06:56.447 --> 06:58.118
LOOK WHO YOU BROUGHT.

06:58.118 --> 07:00.821
DANNY HAD TO FIGHT OFF
THE HOSTESS.

07:00.821 --> 07:02.092
SOCIO.

07:02.092 --> 07:03.153
OKAY.

07:03.153 --> 07:05.926
FINALLY, I'VE GOT YOU
ALL TO MYSELF.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.459
COME WITH ME. THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANNA SHOW YOU.

07:08.459 --> 07:09.930
WANT A HINT?

07:09.930 --> 07:11.462
(whispers) IT'S MY BED.

07:11.462 --> 07:13.864
AND JO LEARNED FIRSTHAND

07:13.864 --> 07:14.434
THAT PARTYING
WITH THE COOL KIDS...
(all chanting) DO IT! DO IT!

07:14.434 --> 07:16.006
(cheering)

07:16.006 --> 07:17.137
ISN'T REALLY ALL THAT COOL.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.068
GET THE HELL OFF OF ME!

07:18.068 --> 07:20.040
HEY! HEY! HEY!
(boy) YEAH! HEY!

07:20.040 --> 07:22.172
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS,
FREAK.

07:22.172 --> 07:24.114
FREAK?

07:25.946 --> 07:27.818
(girl gasps)

07:27.818 --> 07:29.820
(whispers indistinctly)

07:29.820 --> 07:30.981
WHATEVER DANNY WHISPERED
TO SCOTT

07:30.981 --> 07:33.123
MUST'VE BEEN PRETTY HARD-CORE.

07:38.829 --> 07:40.230
(horn honks)

07:40.230 --> 07:42.032
LACEY FELT KINDA BAD
FOR HER EX-FRIENDS

07:42.032 --> 07:43.964
AND OFFERED UP A RIDE...

07:43.964 --> 07:45.536
THEY DIDN'T TEACH YOU HOW TO
DRIVE IN PRISON, DID THEY?

07:45.536 --> 07:47.237
JUST GET IN.

07:47.237 --> 07:51.542
AND IT LED HER BACK TO
LITERAL THE SCENE OF THE CRIME.

07:51.542 --> 07:54.044
THANKS. YOU SAVED ME AN HOUR
OF TEDIOUS DRUNK WALKING.

07:54.044 --> 07:55.175
DON'T MENTION IT.

07:55.175 --> 07:57.978
SERIOUSLY, TO ANYONE EVER.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.179
GOT IT.

07:59.179 --> 08:02.182
SO... SINCE ALL THIS
APPARENTLY NEVER HAPPENED,

08:02.182 --> 08:04.785
DO YOU WANNA COME IN,
HANG OUT?

08:04.785 --> 08:06.917
(sighs)

08:06.917 --> 08:08.118
POOR JO.

08:08.118 --> 08:10.060
OKAY, WHAT'D SHE SAY?

08:10.060 --> 08:11.992
I DITCHED HER,
ABANDONED HER?

08:11.992 --> 08:14.124
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

08:14.124 --> 08:17.267
WHY?
THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED?

08:17.267 --> 08:19.029
DO YOU THINK IT WAS EASY

08:19.029 --> 08:20.631
BEING THE BEST FRIENDS
OF A CHILD MURDERER?

08:20.631 --> 08:23.203
MIDDLE SCHOOL'S ROUGH ENOUGH
WITHOUT ALL THAT CRAP. SO...

08:23.203 --> 08:26.937
EXCUSE ME FOR DOING WHAT
I HAD TO DO TO SURVIVE.

08:26.937 --> 08:28.178
LOOK,

08:28.178 --> 08:30.881
I REGRET...

08:30.881 --> 08:33.113
NOT GROWING UP
WITH YOU AND JO.

08:34.184 --> 08:36.116
I MISS THAT.

08:36.116 --> 08:38.218
I THINK YOU MISS IT, TOO.

08:39.850 --> 08:41.822
LESSON 3--

08:41.822 --> 08:44.855
"BEWARE THE BOOTY CALL TEXT."

08:48.028 --> 08:51.161
OKAY, SO HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW
FOR SURE ABOUT THAT NIGHT.

08:51.161 --> 08:52.302
(cell phone alert chimes)

08:52.302 --> 08:55.165
REGINA CONTINUED TO BE...

08:55.165 --> 08:56.567
AGGRESSIVE.

09:04.144 --> 09:07.047
AND MAY BE THERE WAS
MORE THAN JUST...

09:07.047 --> 09:08.278
FRISKINESS BEHIND IT.

09:08.278 --> 09:10.080
(alert chimes)

09:19.660 --> 09:24.294
THE NEXT MORNING, JO WOKE UP
HUNGOVER AND NOSTALGIC.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.599
LACEY WOKE UP AT DANNY'S,

09:28.599 --> 09:33.173
A LITTLE GROSSED OUT
AND REALLY CONFUSED.

09:33.173 --> 09:34.104
(woman) REGINA!

09:34.104 --> 09:36.176
(speaks Spanish)

09:36.176 --> 09:37.047
AND REGINA CRANE?

09:37.047 --> 09:39.209
(door closes)
(mutters)

09:39.209 --> 09:42.582
REGINA DIDN'T WAKE UP AT ALL.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.184
AAH!

09:53.323 --> 09:57.197
REGINA WAS A LOVING,
POSITIVE FORCE IN OUR COMMUNITY.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.329
HERE'S SOMETHING
I PICKED UP FROM DANNY...

09:59.329 --> 10:01.331
WE MUST COME TOGETHER
IN OUR GRIEF

10:01.331 --> 10:02.773
AND SUPPORT EACH OTHER.

10:02.773 --> 10:04.635
SOCIO.

10:04.635 --> 10:06.236
SOCIO.

10:06.236 --> 10:08.208
A LITTLE SOMETHING
CALLED LESSON 4--

10:09.680 --> 10:11.611
"THERE WILL BE HATERS."

10:11.611 --> 10:14.614
PLEASE STOP SPREADING UNFOUNDED
ACCUSATIONS AGAINST YOUR PEERS.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.246
SORRY TO INTERRUPT,
PRINCIPAL.

10:16.246 --> 10:17.387
(door closes)

10:17.387 --> 10:18.889
DANNY DESAI?

10:18.889 --> 10:20.250
UH, WE'D LIKE YOU TO
COME WITH US, DANNY.

10:20.250 --> 10:22.392
WE NEED TO ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS.

10:22.392 --> 10:24.254
DAD.
IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE SCHOOL?

10:24.254 --> 10:26.196
SORRY, HONEY.

10:26.196 --> 10:28.158
OH, DID I MENTION JO'S DAD IS
CHIEF OF POLICE?

10:28.158 --> 10:29.730
(murmuring)

10:29.730 --> 10:31.361
I KNOW THAT WE'RE ALL SCARED.

10:31.361 --> 10:34.334
WHICH MADE THIS
A LITTLE AWKWARD.

10:34.334 --> 10:38.168
IT'S EASY TO FOCUS ALL OF THAT
ON THE OBVIOUS PERSON.

10:38.168 --> 10:39.409
BUT IS THAT REALLY FAIR?

10:39.409 --> 10:43.213
I DON'T KNOW
IF DANNY DID THIS OR NOT,

10:43.213 --> 10:45.275
BUT DO YOU?

10:45.275 --> 10:47.217
DO ANY OF US?

10:48.919 --> 10:51.221
I KNOW YOU AGREE WITH ME. I SAW
YOUR FACE WHILE I WAS TALKING.

10:51.221 --> 10:52.683
THAT WASN'T MY AGREEMENT FACE.

10:52.683 --> 10:54.855
THAT WAS MY "WHAT THE HELL
IS SHE THINKING?" FACE.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.887
SOMEONE HAS TO GIVE HIM
THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT.

10:56.887 --> 10:58.288
AND THAT SOMEONE
HAS TO BE YOU?

10:58.288 --> 11:01.331
NO. US.
WHO ELSE IS GONNA DO IT?

11:01.331 --> 11:03.764
DEFINITELY NOT JO'S DAD.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.265
I SWEAR I-I GOT THE TEXT,

11:05.265 --> 11:06.767
I TURNED OFF MY PHONE,
AND WENT TO BED.

11:06.767 --> 11:07.968
AND YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO TALK TO HER,

11:07.968 --> 11:09.700
JUST TO FIND OUT
WHAT THE HELL SHE MEANT?

11:09.700 --> 11:12.402
I KNEW WHAT SHE MEANT.
SHE WANTED TO GET ME INTO BED.

11:12.402 --> 11:16.877
DANNY, THE PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN
DON'T CARE ABOUT THE TRUTH.

11:16.877 --> 11:19.349
ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS
YOUR HEAD ON A STICK.

11:19.349 --> 11:20.310
TELL ME WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

11:20.310 --> 11:21.812
NOTHING.

11:21.812 --> 11:23.814
NOTHING HAPPENED.

11:23.814 --> 11:25.756
I DIDN'T LEAVE MY ROOM
AFTER 12:30.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.861
THAT NECKLACE LOOK FAMILIAR?

11:32.763 --> 11:34.294
TOLD YOU IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT.

11:34.294 --> 11:36.466
NOPE. NOT AT ALL.

11:36.466 --> 11:38.729
WHY?

11:38.729 --> 11:41.331
HOUSEKEEPER CLAIMS
THAT REGINA NEVER TOOK IT OFF,

11:41.331 --> 11:43.874
YET IT WAS THE ONLY THING THAT
WAS MISSING IN THE ENTIRE HOUSE.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.778
LESSON 5--

11:47.778 --> 11:50.410
"FIGURE IT OUT YOURSELF."

11:50.410 --> 11:52.312
I MYSELF LIKE A GOOD MYSTERY.

11:52.312 --> 11:53.844
THE TEXT WAS THE ONLY REASON
HE BROUGHT YOU IN, RIGHT?

11:53.844 --> 11:55.345
YEAH, THAT'S IT.

11:55.345 --> 11:57.487
SO I WAS PRETTY PUMPED
TO DROP SOME KNOWLEDGE.

11:57.487 --> 11:59.389
WELL, THEN IT'S A WEAK CASE.
THEY HAVE NOTHING

11:59.389 --> 12:01.421
UNLESS THEY CAN CONNECT DANNY
TO THE CRIME SCENE.

12:01.421 --> 12:04.394
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHO ELSE
HAD A REASON TO HURT REGINA.

12:04.394 --> 12:06.426
(Kyle) JO.

12:06.426 --> 12:07.858
DAD.

12:07.858 --> 12:09.299
DANNY AND I WERE JUST--
GET IN THE CAR.

12:09.299 --> 12:11.461
OKAY, CALM DOWN.

12:11.461 --> 12:13.804
CAR NOW.

12:13.804 --> 12:15.435
CHIEF MASTERSON. HELLO, SIR.

12:15.435 --> 12:17.808
STAY AWAY FROM MY DAUGHTER.

12:19.810 --> 12:21.371
I KNOW HE'S AN EASY TARGET.

12:21.371 --> 12:23.013
DON'T RUIN HIS LIFE NOW

12:23.013 --> 12:24.975
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE STILL
HOLDING A GRUDGE.

12:24.975 --> 12:26.516
THERE IS ACTUAL EVIDENCE.

12:26.516 --> 12:28.348
ONE TEXT FROM A DRUNK GIRL,

12:28.348 --> 12:31.982
CLAIMING TO KNOW ABOUT SOMETHING
THAT HAPPENED FIVE YEARS AGO?

12:31.982 --> 12:34.524
THIS NECKLACE LOOK FAMILIAR?

12:38.258 --> 12:40.330
I'VE NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.334
THIS OKAY?

12:44.334 --> 12:47.437
YOUR DAD DOESN'T HAVE, LIKE,
PSYCHO CAMS EVERYWHERE, DOES HE?

12:47.437 --> 12:49.339
I HAVE A PLAN.

12:49.339 --> 12:50.500
DOES IT INVOLVE BRAINWASHING?

12:50.500 --> 12:53.003
UH, SORT OF ACTUALLY--MY MOM.

12:53.003 --> 12:54.875
OKAY, SO I SAY

12:54.875 --> 12:56.977
WE DO, LIKE, A FUN,
LOW-KEY DINNER,

12:56.977 --> 12:58.879
JUST US AND OUR MOMS.

12:58.879 --> 13:01.081
IF WE JUST SHOW MY MOM
HOW NORMAL YOU ARE,

13:01.081 --> 13:02.452
SHE CAN CONVINCE MY DAD
TO TONE IT DOWN.

13:02.452 --> 13:03.914
HE LISTENS TO HER.

13:03.914 --> 13:05.515
OH, DON'T WORRY, JO.

13:05.515 --> 13:06.786
KILLER BOY TOY HERE WILL GET
CONJUGAL VISITS

13:06.786 --> 13:08.418
ONCE HE'S BACK IN PRISON.

13:08.418 --> 13:11.862
OH, LACEY'S BOYFRIEND ARCHIE?
NOT A BIG DANNY FAN.

13:11.862 --> 13:13.393
MAYBE WE CAN BE ROOMIES.

13:13.393 --> 13:14.324
WHAT'D YOU SAY?
DANNY.

13:14.324 --> 13:16.026
YOU HEARD ME.

13:16.026 --> 13:17.427
WHY WOULD I END UP THERE?

13:17.427 --> 13:19.299
EITHER YOU'RE GOING TO PRISON,

13:19.299 --> 13:21.431
OR YOU'RE PUMPING GAS
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

13:21.431 --> 13:23.433
UHH!
(girl gasps)

13:25.405 --> 13:26.806
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.078
(murmuring)

13:28.078 --> 13:31.011
YOU DON'T KNOW ME EITHER.

13:33.813 --> 13:36.246
LESSON 6--

13:36.246 --> 13:37.547
"DON'T FORGET YOUR MANNERS."

13:37.547 --> 13:39.319
(doorbell rings)

13:39.319 --> 13:42.322
SO REMEMBER
JO'S CRAZY DINNER PARTY IDEA?

13:42.322 --> 13:45.025
WELL, IT BEGAN
WITH A SURPRISE GUEST.

13:45.025 --> 13:47.057
DINNER SMELLS GREAT.

13:47.057 --> 13:48.458
I BROUGHT PINOT.

13:48.458 --> 13:50.060
OH, I-I DON'T MEAN ME.
I WAS INVITED.

13:51.361 --> 13:53.833
WOW, THIS PLACE
HASN'T CHANGED AT ALL.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.106
YEAH, MY MOTHER ISN'T BIG
ON CHANGE.

13:56.106 --> 13:57.607
OH, I GET IT.
CHANGE IS HARD.

13:57.607 --> 13:59.369
I AGREE, DAD,

13:59.369 --> 14:01.041
BUT IF YOU SPEND TOO MUCH TIME
OBSESSING OVER THE PAST

14:01.041 --> 14:02.873
OR SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED
IN THE PAST,

14:02.873 --> 14:05.445
YOU CAN LOSE FOCUS
ON THE PRESENT SITUATION.

14:05.445 --> 14:07.177
CHIEF MASTERSON'S
PARTY CRASHING

14:07.177 --> 14:09.849
KIND OF TURNED
DANNY'S OWN HOME AGAINST HIM.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.421
REFILL ON THE WINE, SIR?

14:11.421 --> 14:13.083
SURE.

14:13.083 --> 14:16.626
UH, I NEED TO USE THE RESTROOM.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

14:16.626 --> 14:19.189
I'LL GET HIM HIS WINE.

14:24.264 --> 14:28.868
THE CHIEF'S BATHROOM TRIP
TOOK A LITTLE DETOUR.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.971
PROBABLY GOT LOST.
IT'S A BIG HOUSE.

14:34.004 --> 14:36.106
GET LOST FINDING THE BATHROOM?

14:36.106 --> 14:37.877
SORRY. I, UH...

14:37.877 --> 14:41.151
PASSED YOUR ROOM
AND, UH, SAW THIS PHOTO.

14:41.151 --> 14:42.612
I THINK TOOK THIS ONE.

14:43.653 --> 14:46.416
WHEN WE FINALLY
SAT DOWN TO EAT,

14:46.416 --> 14:48.088
THINGS WERE GOING WELL.

14:48.088 --> 14:50.320
DANNY, HAVE YOU EVEN SEEN
THE NEW McNALLY PARK?

14:50.320 --> 14:52.322
UH, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THERE WAS
A NEW McNALLY PARK.

14:52.322 --> 14:53.493
WE SHOULD CHECK IT OUT.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.025
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

14:55.025 --> 14:56.566
AND WHY IS THAT?

14:56.566 --> 14:58.568
I'M NOT SURE
IT WOULD BE SAFE.

14:58.568 --> 15:01.631
YOU MEAN IT WOULDN'T BE SAFE
WITH MY SON THERE.

15:01.631 --> 15:04.434
YOU THINK MY SON'S
A PSYCHOPATHIC MURDERER.

15:04.434 --> 15:07.337
I MEAN, MAYBE IT WAS
A TEENY BIT UNCOMFORTABLE.

15:07.337 --> 15:10.941
KAREN, EVERYONE'S TRYING TO DEAL
WITH A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION.

15:10.941 --> 15:13.313
YEAH, WELL, A SITUATION
YOU BLAME ON ME.

15:13.313 --> 15:15.045
I DON'T BLAME YOU FOR ANYTHING.

15:15.045 --> 15:16.616
THEN WHY DID YOU CALL ME
A BAD MOTHER?

15:16.616 --> 15:18.918
THAT WAS FIVE YEARS AGO.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.521
AND WHAT YOU WERE ASKING OF US
WAS COMPLETELY UNREASONABLE.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.153
WAIT. WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT?

15:24.354 --> 15:26.056
MY LATE HUSBAND AND I WANTED
YOUR PARENTS TO LET YOU

15:26.056 --> 15:28.598
BE A CHARACTER WITNESS
AT DANNY'S SENTENCING.

15:28.598 --> 15:30.930
WE WERE JUST TRYING TO PROTECT
OUR DAUGHTER.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.662
HER TESTIMONY MIGHT'VE MADE
A DIFFERENCE!

15:32.662 --> 15:34.334
IT WOULD'VE MADE
NO DIFFERENCE!

15:34.334 --> 15:36.466
I LOST MY SON FOR FIVE YEARS!

15:36.466 --> 15:38.468
AND HE'S LUCKY
HE GOT FIVE YEARS!

15:40.240 --> 15:43.073
OKAY, IT WAS PRETTY MUCH
A DISASTER.

15:43.073 --> 15:44.714
AT LEAST THE FOOD WAS GOOD.

15:46.476 --> 15:48.078
THAT DINNER PARTY WAS
FUN, NUH?

15:48.078 --> 15:50.650
UGH. (sighs) JUST LIKE
THE GOOD OLD DAYS.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.352
DID YOU SEE THAT PHOTO?

15:52.352 --> 15:55.625
WHEN WE GOT THERE, I NOTICED
A SHELF OF FAMILY PHOTOS,

15:55.625 --> 15:57.357
AND THERE WAS ONE
WITH TARA DESAI IN IT.

15:57.357 --> 15:59.329
REALLY?
YEAH.

15:59.329 --> 16:00.660
THE WEIRDEST PART WAS,

16:00.660 --> 16:02.092
WHEN WE LEFT,
I PASSED THE SHELF AGAIN,

16:02.092 --> 16:04.134
AND THE PHOTO WITH TARA
WAS GONE.

16:05.295 --> 16:08.538
MAYBE KAREN OR DANNY
MOVED IT.

16:08.538 --> 16:10.240
MAYBE THEY SAW IT

16:10.240 --> 16:13.703
AND WERE EMBARRASSED
IT WAS SITTING OUT LIKE THAT.

16:13.703 --> 16:18.378
YEAH, OR MAYBE DANNY WAS
KEEPING SOME MAJOR SECRETS.

16:24.414 --> 16:26.016
WOW!

16:26.016 --> 16:27.987
DANNY HAD THE NECKLACE
ALL ALONG!

16:36.726 --> 16:38.528
AND, I MEAN,
WHO ASKS A GIRL FOR A RIDE

16:38.528 --> 16:40.600
WHEN THEY ALREADY HAVE A CAR
IF THEY DON'T ACTUALLY LIKE HER?

16:40.600 --> 16:42.472
HELLO, MIXED SIGNALS!
HOW ARE YOU?

16:42.472 --> 16:45.075
THANKS TO MY NEW LAB PARTNER'S
GIFT FOR OVERSHARING,

16:45.075 --> 16:47.207
I FOUND OUT THAT
ON THE NIGHT REGINA DIED...
(coughs)

16:47.207 --> 16:48.678
JANA HOOKED UP WITH
ARCHIE'S BEST FRIEND SCOTT,

16:48.678 --> 16:50.610
WHO HAD LOANED ARCHIE HIS CAR
WHEN...

16:50.610 --> 16:52.412
WAIT. WHAT ARE--YOU KNOW WHAT?
D--I'M SORRY.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.514
ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW IS,
ARCHIE'S ALIBI SUCKED.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.646
I'M GOING OUT,
BLOW OFF SOME STEAM.

16:56.646 --> 16:58.418
BIG GAME TOMORROW.

16:58.418 --> 17:01.551
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED TO STAY IN
THE NIGHT BEFORE A BIG GAME.

17:01.551 --> 17:04.394
ISN'T THAT WHY YOU DIDN'T GO
TO REGINA'S PARTY?

17:04.394 --> 17:07.157
THAT WAS--THAT WAS A...
AWAY GAME.

17:07.157 --> 17:09.059
THIS IS A HOME GAME.
DIFFERENT RULES.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.402
LESSON 7--

17:12.402 --> 17:15.365
"DON'T TRUST THE POPULAR JOCK."

17:15.365 --> 17:16.706
WAIT. I THOUGHT YOU SAID
ARCHIE WAS HOME

17:16.706 --> 17:18.738
THE NIGHT OF REGINA'S PARTY.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.240
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.172
RESTING UP FOR THE BIG GAME
THE NEXT DAY.

17:22.172 --> 17:23.573
IF HE WAS HOME RESTING,

17:23.573 --> 17:25.475
WHY DID HE NEED TO BORROW
SCOTT'S CAR ALL NIGHT?

17:25.475 --> 17:26.816
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP!

17:26.816 --> 17:29.779
WE GOT A NEW PLAYER--
DANNY DESAI.

17:29.779 --> 17:31.681
WHEN DANNY JOINED
THE SOCCER TEAM...

17:31.681 --> 17:32.722
WE'RE GONNA GIVE HIM A SHOT.

17:32.722 --> 17:34.754
I THINK HE CAN REALLY HELP US.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.826
(lowered voice) YEAH,
IF HE DOESN'T KILL US FIRST.
(stifles laugh)

17:36.826 --> 17:39.489
IT GAVE HIM A CHANCE
TO WATCH ARCHIE UP CLOSE.

17:39.489 --> 17:41.461
HEY, FREAK!

17:41.461 --> 17:43.133
LET'S WARM UP.

17:43.133 --> 17:45.064
WE'RE, UH, WE'RE BACK
TO "FREAK," HUH?

17:45.064 --> 17:46.566
I KINDA MISSED IT.

17:46.566 --> 17:49.239
HEY, GIRLS. LOOK WHO'S HERE.

17:49.239 --> 17:51.341
THEN JO CRASHED
LACEY'S SLEEPOVER

17:51.341 --> 17:53.773
TO SEE WHAT SHE COULD LEARN
FROM REGINA'S FRIENDS.

17:53.773 --> 17:54.844
WHAT IS THIS?

17:54.844 --> 17:56.706
REGINA'S MOM GAVE IT TO ME.

17:56.706 --> 17:58.408
IT'S JUST SOME OF
REGINA'S PERSONAL STUFF,

17:58.408 --> 18:00.110
MOSTLY FROM SCHOOL.

18:05.715 --> 18:09.859
WHAT JO FOUND IN REGINA'S STUFF

18:09.859 --> 18:11.861
MADE IT SEEM LIKE
ARCHIE AND REGINA

18:11.861 --> 18:14.424
MIGHT'VE HAD A LITTLE...

18:14.424 --> 18:16.766
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING GOING ON.

18:16.766 --> 18:19.229
AND WHEN LACEY FOUND OUT,

18:19.229 --> 18:21.231
SHE WAS NOT COOL WITH IT.

18:21.231 --> 18:22.532
YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT

18:22.532 --> 18:24.334
MY BOYFRIEND WAS SLEEPING WITH
MY BEST FRIEND,

18:24.334 --> 18:26.236
AND THAT LED TO
HIM MURDERING HER?

18:26.236 --> 18:28.138
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED. I'M JUST L--

18:28.138 --> 18:30.280
SAVE IT.

18:30.280 --> 18:32.111
DANNY CALLED OUT ARCHIE...

18:32.111 --> 18:34.744
YOUR ALIBI
THE NIGHT OF THE PARTY?

18:34.744 --> 18:37.217
(scoffs) IT SUCKS.

18:37.217 --> 18:39.189
I WAS HOME.

18:39.189 --> 18:40.520
THE TRUTH WAS REVEALED...

18:40.520 --> 18:43.593
IS THAT RIGHT, SCOTT?

18:43.593 --> 18:46.826
JUST TELL HIM, ARCHIE.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LEAVE ANYWAY.

18:46.826 --> 18:50.160
BUT NOT EXACTLY
THE ONE WE EXPECTED.

18:50.160 --> 18:52.862
YEAH, OKAY. UH...

18:52.862 --> 18:55.265
I BORROWED SCOTT'S CAR.

18:55.265 --> 18:57.867
I HAD A MEETING WITH THE COACH
AT MERCY PREP.

18:57.867 --> 18:59.839
WHAT, WERE YOU GONNA--
YOU GONNA DITCH US

18:59.839 --> 19:01.341
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SEASON?

19:01.341 --> 19:02.612
IT WAS JUST A MEETING.
NOTHING CAME OF IT.

19:06.376 --> 19:08.248
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY.

19:12.622 --> 19:14.554
LESSON 8--

19:14.554 --> 19:16.586
"EXPECT SOME GRUDGES."

19:16.586 --> 19:19.429
(Karen) I CAN'T BELIEVE
I LET YOU TALK ME INTO THIS.

19:19.429 --> 19:22.432
KAREN DESAI'S ATTEMPTS
TO FIT IN

19:22.432 --> 19:23.533
WENT ABOUT AS WELL AS DANNY'S.

19:23.533 --> 19:25.435
GLORIA.

19:25.435 --> 19:28.167
I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT
I'M REALLY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.469
I DIDN'T KNOW REGINA,

19:29.469 --> 19:31.301
BUT I HEARD SHE WAS
A REALLY LOVELY GIRL.

19:31.301 --> 19:32.572
AND SHE'D STILL BE HERE

19:32.572 --> 19:35.575
IF IT WEREN'T FOR
YOUR DERANGED MONSTER OF A SON.

19:35.575 --> 19:37.577
I'VE ALREADY TALKED
TO THE SCHOOL BOARD

19:37.577 --> 19:39.949
ABOUT HAVING HIM KICKED OUT
OF GREEN GROVE HIGH.

19:39.949 --> 19:42.452
I--
AND THEN I'LL MAKE IT
MY PERSONAL MISSION

19:42.452 --> 19:44.484
TO ENSURE THAT HE SPENDS
THE REST OF HIS NATURAL LIFE

19:44.484 --> 19:46.356
EXACTLY WHERE HE BELONGS--

19:46.356 --> 19:47.917
IN PRISON.

19:47.917 --> 19:50.560
GLORIA CRANE WASN'T
THE ONLY ONE GUNNING FOR DANNY.

19:50.560 --> 19:52.492
KAREN DESAI,

19:52.492 --> 19:54.193
I HAVE A WARRANT
TO SEARCH THE PREMISES,

19:54.193 --> 19:56.195
IN CONNECTION WITH THE MURDER
OF REGINA CRANE.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.867
THERE'S AN ITEM MISSING
FROM THE CRIME SCENE.

20:01.271 --> 20:04.604
CHIEF MASTERSON DIDN'T FIND
ANYTHING,

20:04.604 --> 20:07.677
BUT DANNY FINALLY LET JO AND ME
IN ON A SECRET.

20:07.677 --> 20:09.509
I KNOW WHAT HE WAS
LOOKING FOR.

20:09.509 --> 20:12.211
WHEN REGINA DIED,
SHE WAS, UH,

20:12.211 --> 20:14.544
SHE WAS WEARING
MY AUNT TARA'S NECKLACE.

20:15.915 --> 20:17.547
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US THAT?

20:17.547 --> 20:19.589
I KNOW THIS DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

20:19.589 --> 20:23.293
OKAY, BUT HE DIDN'T FIND
ANYTHING, OBVIOUSLY.

20:23.293 --> 20:25.655
I CAN'T HELP YOU IF YOU DON'T
TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW.

20:27.657 --> 20:31.561
I GUESS WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
HOW REGINA GOT THAT NECKLACE,

20:31.561 --> 20:33.633
AND WHO HAS IT NOW.

20:35.305 --> 20:37.707
(Lacey) MRS. CRANE, DO YOU KNOW
WHERE REGINA GOT THAT NECKLACE?

20:37.707 --> 20:40.640
SHE STARTED WEARING IT
SIX OR SEVEN MONTHS AGO.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.612
SHE TOLD ME IT WAS A GIFT.

20:42.612 --> 20:44.374
SHE NEVER SAID
WHO GAVE IT TO HER?

20:44.374 --> 20:45.615
WELL, LACEY,
IF YOU DON'T MIND,

20:45.615 --> 20:47.477
I HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

20:47.477 --> 20:49.549
I'M FINALLY GETTING TO ALL THESE
CONDOLENCE LETTERS.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.281
DO YOU WANT SOME HELP?

20:51.281 --> 20:54.624
LACEY, THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL.
THANK YOU.

20:54.624 --> 20:56.686
LESSON 9--

20:56.686 --> 20:58.958
"BUILD YOUR SOCIO NETWORK."

20:58.958 --> 21:00.330
FALL FEST IS
A CHERISHED TRADITION.

21:00.330 --> 21:01.561
IT'S A FAMILY EVENT.

21:01.561 --> 21:03.363
THE LAST THING WE NEED IS
A KILLER COMING

21:03.363 --> 21:04.434
AND FREAKING EVERYONE OUT.

21:04.434 --> 21:05.995
WOW. TELL US HOW
YOU REALLY FEEL,

21:05.995 --> 21:08.538
TIM CALVERT, LOCAL RESIDENT.

21:08.538 --> 21:10.600
COME ON, BUY WARM PI PIES.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.271
THEY PUN AND THEY TASTE GREAT.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.543
BUY A FRESH PI PIE!

21:13.543 --> 21:15.405
(Rico) WHEN JO BROUGHT DANNY
TO FALL FEST

21:15.405 --> 21:17.377
TO HELP WITH
THE MATHLETE PI PIE BOOTH...

21:17.377 --> 21:18.978
CAN YOU CARRY THESE PIES
OVER TO THE TABLE?
YEAH.

21:18.978 --> 21:20.510
I WASN'T THRILLED.

21:20.510 --> 21:21.651
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
MY HELP.

21:21.651 --> 21:23.453
YEAH, YOUR HELP.

21:23.453 --> 21:24.614
OKAY.

21:25.685 --> 21:27.657
SIR, WOULD YOU LIKE TO BUY
A PI PIE?

NOT FROM YOU.

21:28.988 --> 21:30.660
NEITHER WAS TIM CALVERT.

21:30.660 --> 21:32.422
WHERE DO YOU GET OFF,

21:32.422 --> 21:35.024
BEING HERE, ACTING LIKE
EVERYTHING'S OKAY?

21:35.024 --> 21:36.496
LEAVE HIM ALONE.

21:36.496 --> 21:37.667
JUST BACK THE HELL OFF.

21:37.667 --> 21:39.569
HE HAS AS MUCH OF A RIGHT
TO BE HERE AS YOU.

21:39.569 --> 21:41.401
IT'S COOL. I CAN JUST LEAVE.

21:41.401 --> 21:42.702
HOW CAN YOU DEFEND HIM?
HE'S A FREAKIN' MURDERER!

21:42.702 --> 21:43.703
YOU'RE A RIGHT-WING NUT!

21:43.703 --> 21:45.034
SIR--
(grunts)

TIM! TIM!

21:50.440 --> 21:52.582
KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF HIM, TIM,
OKAY?

21:53.613 --> 21:56.546
I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU PROMISED
TO DO ALL THIS.

21:56.546 --> 21:58.548
GUILTY IS
A POWERFUL MOTIVATOR.

21:58.548 --> 22:02.021
SO YOU ASKED ABOUT
SOME STUPID NECKLACE. SO WHAT?

22:02.021 --> 22:03.693
HELPING OUT MRS. CRANE

22:03.693 --> 22:07.697
TURNED UP AN INTERESTING TIDBIT
ABOUT REGINA'S PAST.

22:18.438 --> 22:19.839
♪ I CAN'T LIVE ♪

22:19.839 --> 22:22.672
THE FALL FEST FORMAL WAS
A CLINIC IN HEART CRUSHING.

22:22.672 --> 22:23.743
ONE SLOW DANCE.

22:23.743 --> 22:25.645
ON THE PLUS SIDE, I DID LEARN

22:25.645 --> 22:27.677
THAT JO LOOKS
FREAKING INCREDIBLE IN A DRESS.

22:27.677 --> 22:29.749
♪♪♪

22:29.749 --> 22:32.552
BUT IT ALSO TAUGHT ME...

22:32.552 --> 22:34.554
UH... AHEM.

22:34.554 --> 22:36.556
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S JUST MOVE ON.

22:36.556 --> 22:40.430
ANYWAY, LACEY LET DANNY IN
ON THE LETTER TO REGINA.

22:40.430 --> 22:42.692
IT'S POSTMARKED TWO DAYS
BEFORE SHE DIED.

22:42.692 --> 22:44.694
WE HAVE TO TAKE THIS
TO THE POLICE.

22:44.694 --> 22:47.697
I OWE IT TO HER TO FIND OUT
WHAT THIS MEANS FIRST.

22:47.697 --> 22:49.569
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHO SENT THIS.

22:49.569 --> 22:51.701
BUT BEFORE THEY GOT TO THAT...

22:51.701 --> 22:53.643
WHY DO YOU WANNA MEET
LIKE THIS?

22:53.643 --> 22:55.775
UNLESS YOU WANNA
GET ME ALONE.

22:55.775 --> 22:57.777
THEY GOT TO THIS.

23:02.582 --> 23:04.484
SPEAKING OF UNEXPECTED,

23:04.484 --> 23:08.658
KAREN DESAI UNCOVERED EVIDENCE
THAT DANNY HAD BEEN...

23:08.658 --> 23:10.820
SURPRISE! LESS THAN HONEST.

23:13.162 --> 23:15.465
AND THAT'S WHEN
DANNY'S MOM TAUGHT ME

23:15.465 --> 23:17.467
A LITTLE SOMETHING
OF HER OWN...

23:18.798 --> 23:21.771
HOW TO DISPOSE OF EVIDENCE.

23:21.771 --> 23:25.705
THAT'S RIGHT.
I SAW HER WITH MY OWN EYES.

23:36.846 --> 23:38.688
MOTHER?

23:38.688 --> 23:40.019
GETTING RID OF THE NECKLACE

23:40.019 --> 23:42.051
DID NOT GO OVER WELL
WITH DANNY.

23:42.051 --> 23:43.753
WHERE IS IT?

23:43.753 --> 23:45.595
I GOT RID OF IT.

23:45.595 --> 23:47.797
(cupholder thuds)
I NEEDED THAT NECKLACE.

23:47.797 --> 23:49.629
WHY DID YOU HAVE IT?

23:49.629 --> 23:51.060
IT WAS IN MY LOCKER, OKAY?

23:51.060 --> 23:52.832
THE DAY AFTER REGINA DIED,

23:52.832 --> 23:54.033
SOMEONE JUST LEFT IT THERE
FOR ME.

23:54.033 --> 23:56.606
WHOEVER KILLED HER
MUST HAVE KNOWN THAT

23:56.606 --> 23:59.709
THAT NECKLACE
BELONGED TO AUNT TARA.

23:59.709 --> 24:02.772
THEY KNEW THAT IT WOULD
MAKE ME LOOK GUILTY.

24:02.772 --> 24:03.813
WELL, THE NECKLACE
IS GONE NOW.

24:05.815 --> 24:07.747
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS
NAGGING ME, TOO.

24:07.747 --> 24:08.778
HE'S JUST A FRIEND.

24:08.778 --> 24:10.880
YEAH, A FRIEND YOU WANNA
MATE WITH.

24:10.880 --> 24:12.782
"MATE"?

24:12.782 --> 24:13.983
WELL, YOU LOOK LIKE SOMEONE
WHO HAS A CRUSH.

24:13.983 --> 24:16.526
I'M JUST HELPING HIM PROVE
HE DIDN'T KILL REGINA.

24:17.787 --> 24:19.829
JO, LET'S SAY SOMEONE
FINDS SOMETHING

24:19.829 --> 24:21.030
OR SEES SOMETHING

24:21.030 --> 24:23.733
THAT DOESN'T CLEAR HIS NAME.

24:23.733 --> 24:25.665
OR UNCLEARS IT WORSE.

24:25.665 --> 24:28.668
IF YOU'RE ASKING ME
HOW I'D REACT IF DANNY DID IT,

24:28.668 --> 24:30.069
I MEAN, I'D BE DEVASTATED.

24:30.069 --> 24:32.702
BUT TRUST ME,
SOMEONE ELSE KILLED REGINA.

24:33.903 --> 24:36.045
LESSON 10--

24:36.045 --> 24:38.548
"NEVER GO TO CONNECTICUT."

24:38.548 --> 24:39.679
WELL, REGINA NEVER TALKED
ABOUT ANYONE

24:39.679 --> 24:41.781
WHO WOULD SEND
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

24:41.781 --> 24:43.913
NOBODY WAS SURE WHAT TO DO
WITH THE MYSTERIOUS LETTER.

24:43.913 --> 24:46.656
I STILL THINK WE SHOULD JUST
TELL MY DAD ABOUT IT.

24:46.656 --> 24:47.757
I DON'T WANNA TELL ANYONE

24:47.757 --> 24:49.118
UNTIL WE KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON.

24:49.118 --> 24:50.920
DANNY'S LIFE IS AT STAKE HERE.

24:50.920 --> 24:52.662
OKAY, YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO INSISTED ON MEETING HERE,

24:52.662 --> 24:54.564
AND YOU BROUGHT ALL OF THIS
TO US.

24:54.564 --> 24:55.695
I BROUGHT IT TO DANNY.

24:55.695 --> 24:57.126
OKAY, DON'T TURN
ON EACH OTHER.

24:57.126 --> 25:00.099
THE PLAN WAS TO GO TO
THE ADDRESS ON THE LETTER,

25:00.099 --> 25:02.972
BUT THE ROAD TRIP STARTED OFF
A LITTLE BIT...

25:02.972 --> 25:04.203
HEY.
BUMPY.

25:04.203 --> 25:05.635
THANKS FOR WAITING.

25:05.635 --> 25:06.906
YOU DECIDED TO COME?

25:06.906 --> 25:09.839
IT WAS TENSE
ALL THE WAY TO CONNECTICUT.

25:09.839 --> 25:11.911
WHEN THEY FINALLY GOT THERE...

25:11.911 --> 25:14.984
THIS CAME TO US
FROM APARTMENT 413.

25:14.984 --> 25:16.115
WHO LIVES THERE?

25:16.115 --> 25:17.847
THEIR PLAN DIDN'T GO AS...

25:17.847 --> 25:19.789
413?
YOU KNOW...

25:19.789 --> 25:21.621
REALLY?
PLANNED.

25:21.621 --> 25:22.822
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF GAME
YOU KIDS HAVE PLANNED,

25:22.822 --> 25:23.953
BUT GO ON.

25:23.953 --> 25:25.795
AND THE WHOLE
JO AND LACEY THING

25:25.795 --> 25:26.926
FINALLY BLEW UP.

25:26.926 --> 25:28.127
THIS TRIP WAS
SUCH A STUPID IDEA.

25:28.127 --> 25:30.059
YEAH, WELL,
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO COME.

25:30.059 --> 25:33.062
NOT WANTING TO INVITE ME ALONG?
WHAT A LACEY PORTER ORIGINAL.

25:33.062 --> 25:34.163
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

25:34.163 --> 25:36.135
AMBER KLEIN'S
13th BIRTHDAY PARTY.

25:36.135 --> 25:38.908
WHEN THE ENTIRE CLASS
IS INVITED,

25:38.908 --> 25:41.771
AND YOU AREN'T,
IT'S KIND OF SUSPICIOUS.

25:41.771 --> 25:43.843
SO I CONFRONTED AMBER,
AND SHE SAID

25:43.843 --> 25:47.046
LACEY PORTER ASKED HER
NOT TO INVITE ME.

25:47.046 --> 25:49.749
YOU MADE EVERYONE AROUND YOU
MISERABLE, OKAY?

25:49.749 --> 25:51.751
EXCUSE ME
FOR BEING TRAUMATIZED.

25:51.751 --> 25:52.682
THERE YOU GO AGAIN.

25:52.682 --> 25:54.854
JO MASTERSON--
ALWAYS THE VICTIM.

25:54.854 --> 25:57.727
LACEY PORTER--
ALWAYS POPULAR, PERFECT, FUN.

25:57.727 --> 25:59.989
YOU COULDN'T LET ANYONE GET
IN THE WAY OF THAT, COULD YOU?

25:59.989 --> 26:04.293
T EVEN THE ONE PERSON WHO IS
PPOSED TO BE YOUR BEST FRIEND.

26:10.840 --> 26:12.802
BUT DANNY REFUSED
TO LEAVE EMPTY-HANDED,

26:12.802 --> 26:15.705
SO HE HE DID A LITTLE B&E--

26:15.705 --> 26:17.807
THAT'S, UH,
BREAKING AND ENTERING, F.Y.I.--

26:17.807 --> 26:21.781
ONLY TO FIND
AN EMPTY APARTMENT...

26:21.781 --> 26:22.982
AND THE SECURITY GUARD.

26:22.982 --> 26:24.854
(flashlight clicks)

26:24.854 --> 26:26.185
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING
UP HERE?

26:27.216 --> 26:30.189
THE GIRLS PUT THEIR ISSUES
ASIDE LONG ENOUGH

26:30.189 --> 26:31.861
TO FINALLY UNCOVER...

26:31.861 --> 26:33.963
(lowered voice) JO, COME ON.
HE MIGHT COME BACK.

26:33.963 --> 26:35.865
(lowered voice) I FOUND
A BUILDING DIRECTORY.

26:35.865 --> 26:37.296
WHO LIVED IN THE APARTMENT.

26:37.296 --> 26:38.768
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE IT.

26:38.768 --> 26:42.231
OH, MY GOD.

26:42.231 --> 26:44.133
DANNY'S DEAD DAD.

26:47.707 --> 26:49.038
(laughs) I CAN'T BELIEVE

26:49.038 --> 26:51.711
I ALMOST WENT BACK TO JUVIE
TONIGHT.

26:51.711 --> 26:54.714
FOR WHAT? FOR NOTHING. WE DIDN'T
FIGURE OUT ONE FREAKIN' THING.

26:54.714 --> 26:56.686
THE GIRLS AGREED...
I KNOW.

26:56.686 --> 26:58.788
TOTALLY SUCKS.

26:58.788 --> 27:01.190
DANNY DIDN'T NEED TO KNOW ABOUT
HIS DAD AND THE APARTMENT.

27:01.190 --> 27:02.251
YET.

27:02.251 --> 27:03.793
(clears throat)

27:03.793 --> 27:05.324
I, ON THE OTHER HAND,

27:05.324 --> 27:08.027
I'M NOT SO GOOD
AT KEEPING SECRETS.

27:08.027 --> 27:09.759
I SAW SOMETHING.

27:09.759 --> 27:11.831
IT WAS DANNY'S MOM.

27:11.831 --> 27:14.203
I SAW HER THROW SOMETHING
INTO THE WATER.

27:14.203 --> 27:18.908
AND I THINK IT MIGHT'VE BEEN
A NECKLACE.

27:18.908 --> 27:22.772
JO NEEDED TO FIND OUT MORE
ABOUT VIKRAM DESAI...

27:22.772 --> 27:24.744
WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER ABOUT
DANNY'S DAD?

27:24.744 --> 27:27.777
VIK WAS... COMPLEX,

27:27.777 --> 27:30.279
BUT FUN. VERY OUTGOING.

27:30.279 --> 27:34.023
WHAT ABOUT BEFORE HE DIED?
WAS HE DIFFERENT?

27:34.023 --> 27:36.786
HE AND I DIDN'T TALK MUCH
THE LAST FEW YEARS OF HIS LIFE.

27:37.957 --> 27:40.329
(Lacey) MY FRIENDS
WERE USELESS ABOUT REGINA.

27:40.329 --> 27:42.061
YOUR MOM TELL YOU ANYTHING
ABOUT VIKRAM?

27:42.061 --> 27:44.293
"CHARISMATIC" WAS ABOUT ALL
THAT I COULD GET OUT OF HER,

27:44.293 --> 27:46.065
SO...

27:46.065 --> 27:48.167
IT SEEMS LIKELY HE GAVE REGINA
THAT NECKLACE THOUGH, RIGHT?

27:48.167 --> 27:49.969
WHAT WERE THEY DOING
TOGETHER?

27:49.969 --> 27:52.241
YOU REALLY NEED ME TO ANSWER
THAT ONE, LACE?

27:52.241 --> 27:54.073
OKAY, BUT IF IT WAS JUST
SOME GROSS FLING,

27:54.073 --> 27:55.875
THEN WHO SENT
THE CASH AND NOTE?

27:55.875 --> 27:57.146
VIKRAM'S ACCIDENT WAS--

27:57.146 --> 27:59.378
MAYBE WHAT HAPPENED TO VIKRAM
WASN'T AN ACCIDENT.

27:59.378 --> 28:02.211
WHAT IF REGINA KNEW
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?

28:02.211 --> 28:04.683
WHOEVER SENT THAT CASH
COULD'VE BEEN...

28:04.683 --> 28:06.816
PAYING HER TO KEEP QUIET
ABOUT IT.

28:06.816 --> 28:09.819
MAYBE ALL THESE THINGS
ARE SOMEHOW CONNECTED.

28:11.090 --> 28:13.222
YOU GUYS TOLD ME REGINA
SENT HIM THAT TEXT, RIGHT,

28:13.222 --> 28:15.224
SAYING THAT SHE KNEW
WHY HE KILLED TARA?

28:15.224 --> 28:16.866
YEAH. SO YOU'RE SAYING...

28:16.866 --> 28:18.197
WHAT IF HIS REASON
FOR KILLING HIS AUNT

28:18.197 --> 28:20.830
IS SOMEHOW CONNECTED TO
WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?

28:20.830 --> 28:22.701
WHAT WAS FOR SURE
HAPPENING WAS

28:22.701 --> 28:24.834
THE CHIEF WAS FOLLOWING UP
ON MY LEAD.

28:24.834 --> 28:26.175
WHERE ARE WE ON McNALLY PARK?

28:26.175 --> 28:28.137
STILL CLOSED
FOR RENOVATION.

28:28.137 --> 28:29.378
WE'VE COMBED THAT POND
TWO, THREE T--
COMB IT AGAIN.

28:29.378 --> 28:31.110
THAT NECKLACE IS IN THERE.

28:31.110 --> 28:33.883
WHILE THE CHIEF WAS TRACKING
THE NECKLACE,

28:33.883 --> 28:35.314
KIDS PARTIED AT THE CEMETERY--

28:35.314 --> 28:38.347
A BIRTHDAY BASH
FOR TYLER LEWIS.

28:38.347 --> 28:39.849
WHAT?! A PARTY FOR MOI?!

28:39.849 --> 28:41.350
(cheering)
(laughs)

28:41.350 --> 28:43.322
NOW TYLER'S JUST ANOTHER
PRETTY BOY--

28:43.322 --> 28:46.155
ONE WHO, UNFORTUNATELY,
HAS A THING FOR JO.

28:46.155 --> 28:48.858
YOU'RE AN ENIGMA,
JO MASTERSON.

28:48.858 --> 28:50.329
AN ENIGMA I PLAN TO CRACK.

28:50.329 --> 28:52.131
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

28:52.131 --> 28:54.764
THE GIRLS CORNERED DANNY
AND DEMANDED ANSWERS.

28:54.764 --> 28:57.406
WE THINK YOU'VE BEEN KEEPING
TOO MANY SECRETS FROM US.

28:57.406 --> 28:58.737
THERE ARE ALL THESE THINGS
WE DON'T KNOW.

28:58.737 --> 29:00.009
I CAN'T TELL YOU ABOUT TARA.

29:00.009 --> 29:01.140
YES, YOU CAN.
YOU CAN TRUST US.

29:01.140 --> 29:02.741
IT'S NOT ABOUT TRUST, LACEY.

29:02.741 --> 29:04.143
REGINA KNEW YOUR DAD.

29:04.143 --> 29:06.415
BUT THEY GAVE UP
MORE THAN THEY GOT.

29:06.415 --> 29:07.376
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

29:07.376 --> 29:08.918
THAT APARTMENT?

29:08.918 --> 29:11.981
YOUR DAD WAS RENTING IT
BEFORE HE DIED.

29:11.981 --> 29:13.923
WE THINK THAT MAYBE

29:13.923 --> 29:15.424
HE AND REGINA
HAD SOMETHING GOING ON,

29:15.424 --> 29:18.027
THAT MAYBE--
MAYBE HIS DEATH WASN'T
AN ACCIDENT.

29:18.027 --> 29:20.089
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO HIM
COULD BE CONNECTED

29:20.089 --> 29:21.861
TO REGINA'S MURDER.

29:21.861 --> 29:23.762
NOW WHO'S KEEPING SECRETS?

29:26.065 --> 29:27.837
LESSON 11-

29:27.837 --> 29:29.999
"SOCIOS GET THE GIRLS"

29:29.999 --> 29:32.101
(Sarita) I KNOW
YOU WERE WITH THEM.

29:32.101 --> 29:34.503
LACEY WAS FORCED
TO MAKE A CHOICE.

29:34.503 --> 29:36.305
IT'S OBVIOUS YOU'RE
HANGING OUT WITH THEM AGAIN.

29:36.305 --> 29:38.077
SARITA, NO, I'M NOT. (scoffs)

29:38.077 --> 29:40.980
I'M NOT GONNA TELL ANYONE,
BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.

29:40.980 --> 29:42.411
US OR THEM.

29:42.411 --> 29:46.055
(knock on door)

29:46.055 --> 29:48.087
I BROKE UP WITH HIM.

29:52.221 --> 29:54.123
NO ONE CAN KNOW, OKAY?

29:55.464 --> 29:58.127
"NO ONE" ALSO INCLUDED JO.

29:58.127 --> 30:00.199
IT'S JUST...

30:00.199 --> 30:02.201
IT'S DANNY.

30:02.201 --> 30:03.973
I LIKE HIM, MOM.

30:03.973 --> 30:05.835
JO, THAT'S--IT'S NATURAL

30:05.835 --> 30:08.807
THAT YOU MIGHT START TO DEVELOP
A LITTLE CRUSH.

30:08.807 --> 30:11.480
IT'S NOT A CRUSH.

30:11.480 --> 30:13.812
I THINK THAT
I'M IN LOVE WITH HIM.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.945
AND I THINK I HATE HIM.

30:15.945 --> 30:17.316
(knock on door)

30:17.316 --> 30:19.318
HERE'S A LESSON
YOU'VE HEARD BEFORE--

30:19.318 --> 30:20.920
"ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES."

30:20.920 --> 30:22.051
EDDIE.

30:22.051 --> 30:23.352
SORRY TO BUG YOU AT HOME.

30:23.352 --> 30:24.523
EVERYTHING OKAY?

30:24.523 --> 30:25.955
WE FOUND IT.

30:25.955 --> 30:30.259
AND IN MY CASE,
BIG CONSEQUENCES.

30:39.068 --> 30:41.610
MORNING.

30:41.610 --> 30:43.212
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT

30:43.212 --> 30:45.144
HOW REGINA CRANE GOT AHOLD
OF THAT NECKLACE?

30:45.144 --> 30:47.476
DANNY HOPED HIS MOM WOULD
GIVE UP HIS DAD'S SECRET.

30:47.476 --> 30:49.078
COULD IT HAVE BEEN DAD?

30:49.078 --> 30:50.549
NO.

30:50.549 --> 30:52.481
DID DAD KNOW HER--REGINA?
DID THEY EVER MEET?

30:52.481 --> 30:54.453
WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING?

30:54.453 --> 30:57.626
COULD HE HAVE BEEN SEEING
SOMEONE ELSE--

30:57.626 --> 30:59.228
DANNY, STOP IT, PLEASE.
OKAY?

30:59.228 --> 31:01.560
WHAT YOU'RE IMPLYING
IS DISGUSTING.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.092
SHE WOULDN'T PLAY ALONG.

31:03.092 --> 31:05.264
LET'S NOT FOCUS ON THE PAST,
OKAY?

31:05.264 --> 31:09.038
BUT OTHERS HAD NO PROBLEM
DREDGING UP THE PAST.

31:09.038 --> 31:10.299
(Karen) AAH!

31:13.973 --> 31:16.645
AND THE PRANKSTERS WERE JUST
GETTING STARTED.

31:16.645 --> 31:18.647
LESSON 12--

31:18.647 --> 31:21.210
"MASKS ARE CREEPY."

31:21.210 --> 31:22.982
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TODAY,

31:22.982 --> 31:24.984
IF YOU EVER WANNA TALK TO ME
ABOUT IT...

31:24.984 --> 31:26.115
IT'S FINE.

31:26.115 --> 31:28.417
AND RIGHT NOW,
I'M HERE WITH YOU.

31:31.290 --> 31:32.421
(branch snaps)

31:32.421 --> 31:34.523
HELLO?

31:36.265 --> 31:38.397
FUNNY. I GET IT.

31:38.397 --> 31:41.000
HILARIOUS.
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ME.

31:44.333 --> 31:47.676
GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE! GO!

31:47.676 --> 31:49.278
(bottle shatters)

31:52.681 --> 31:55.514
DANNY, BUDDY.

31:55.514 --> 31:58.247
TYLER HAD A PROPOSAL FOR DANNY.

31:58.247 --> 32:00.249
IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT
YOU'D LET ME INTERVIEW YOU

32:00.249 --> 32:01.390
FOR MY DOCUMENTARY?

32:01.390 --> 32:03.392
A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT WHAT?

32:03.392 --> 32:05.394
HOW EVERYONE'S DEALING
WITH YOU COMING BACK.

32:05.394 --> 32:06.996
THE FEAR, THE EMOTION.

32:06.996 --> 32:09.028
GET YOUR SIDE OF THE STORY,
YOU KNOW.

32:09.028 --> 32:10.199
THANKS, BUT I'D KINDA RATHER

32:10.199 --> 32:12.331
NOT DRAW ANY MORE ATTENTION
TO MYSELF.

32:12.331 --> 32:14.163
SUIT YOURSELF.

32:14.163 --> 32:16.265
HE ALSO HAD AN OFFER FOR JO.

32:16.265 --> 32:19.068
HOW ABOUT WE GRAB DINNER THEN?
YOU AND ME. I'M BUYING.

32:21.010 --> 32:22.141
YOU TWO HOOKING UP
OR SOMETHING?

32:22.141 --> 32:23.442
(chuckles)
NO.

32:23.442 --> 32:24.713
NO, SHE'S LIKE, UH,
SHE'S LIKE MY SISTER.

32:24.713 --> 32:28.017
OUCH.

32:28.017 --> 32:30.079
I TRIED TO CONSOLE HER
WITH SOME PRETTY SOLID ADVICE.

32:30.079 --> 32:32.481
HEY, THERE'S ANOTHER GUY
OUT THERE FOR YOU.

32:32.481 --> 32:34.283
I KNOW IT.

32:34.283 --> 32:37.726
BUT, OF COURSE, IT PUSHED HER
STRAIGHT TO TYLER.

32:37.726 --> 32:39.688
SO YOU REMEMBER YESTERDAY,
RIGHT?

32:39.688 --> 32:41.030
WE TALKED ABOUT DINNER.

32:41.030 --> 32:42.361
WE DID?

32:42.361 --> 32:43.962
UH... (sighs)

32:43.962 --> 32:45.694
JO, I'M K--I'M KIDDING.
HOW COULD I EVER FORGET?

32:45.694 --> 32:46.695
(laughs)

32:46.695 --> 32:48.237
I ASSUME
YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND?

32:48.237 --> 32:49.698
I DON'T TRUST THAT GUY,

32:49.698 --> 32:52.441
WITH HIS, LIKE, GLOWING SKIN
AND HIS, LIKE, SMILING.

32:52.441 --> 32:54.043
HE'S JUST ONE OF
THOSE CHEESY GUYS

32:54.043 --> 32:55.644
THAT GIRLS ALWAYS GO FOR.

32:55.644 --> 32:57.246
(clears throat)

32:57.246 --> 32:59.248
HEY, RICO. (clears throat)
YOU HAVE PLANS TONIGHT?

32:59.248 --> 33:01.510
PLANS? NO. WHY?

33:01.510 --> 33:03.982
YOU'RE INVITED.

33:03.982 --> 33:06.285
TO THE PARTY I'M THROWING.

33:06.285 --> 33:07.616
A PARTY AT DANNY'S--

33:07.616 --> 33:10.019
PROBABLY NOT THE GREATEST IDEA.

33:10.019 --> 33:12.991
I JUST DON'T THINK THROWING
A PARTY IS GONNA SOLVE ANYTHING.

33:12.991 --> 33:14.663
BUT IT'S A START.

33:14.663 --> 33:16.025
IT'S BETTER THAN WHAT
I'VE BEEN DOING.

33:16.025 --> 33:17.296
BLENDING IN?

33:17.296 --> 33:18.997
HOPING THAT THINGS
ARE GONNA GET BETTER?

33:18.997 --> 33:22.401
I THINK WE CAN BOTH AGREE
THAT'S--THAT'S NOT WORKING.

33:22.401 --> 33:24.433
WHAT DO YOU THINK'S
GONNA HAPPEN, DANNY?

33:24.433 --> 33:25.704
ONE PARTY AND SUDDENLY

33:25.704 --> 33:28.437
EVERYONE'S GONNA, WHAT,
FORGET ABOUT YOUR PAST?

33:30.379 --> 33:33.642
CHIEF MASTERSON TRIED
TO GET KAREN TO TALK.

33:33.642 --> 33:35.414
I HAVE AN ACTUAL WITNESS.

33:35.414 --> 33:38.187
THIS WITNESS SAW YOU WALK OUT
ONTO THE DOCK

33:38.187 --> 33:40.018
AND THROW SOMETHING
INTO THE POND.

33:40.018 --> 33:42.521
WE SEARCHED THE POND
NEAR THE DOCK

33:42.521 --> 33:44.753
AND FOUND THIS.

33:44.753 --> 33:47.256
THE ITEM MISSING
FROM THE CRIME SCENE.

33:48.697 --> 33:51.630
LESSON 13--

33:51.630 --> 33:53.732
"TYLER LEWIS IS LAME."

33:53.732 --> 33:55.664
JO AND TYLER
SHOWED UP AT DANNY'S

33:55.664 --> 33:58.667
AFTER WHAT I GUESS WAS
A SUCCESSFUL DATE.

33:58.667 --> 34:01.770
JO MARIE MASTERSON,
ARE YOU SMITTEN WITH THIS GUY?

34:01.770 --> 34:03.812
I GUESS WE'LL SEE.

34:03.812 --> 34:06.745
SEEING THAT MADE ME REALLY...

34:06.745 --> 34:08.547
UM, THIRSTY.

34:08.547 --> 34:11.480
WHEN TYLER INTERVIEW DANNY...

34:11.480 --> 34:13.822
YEAH, IT'S BEEN A STRUGGLE
COMING BACK. SURE.

34:13.822 --> 34:17.356
IT'S, UH, DEFINITELY A...
AN ADJUSTMENT.

34:17.356 --> 34:18.787
MORE WAS REVEALED
ABOUT THE INTERVIEWER

34:18.787 --> 34:20.489
THAN HIS SUBJECT.

34:20.489 --> 34:21.790
A-AND HOW--
HOW ARE YOU DEALING

34:21.790 --> 34:23.392
WITH ALL THESE VICIOUS PRANKS
LATELY?

34:23.392 --> 34:25.564
"PRANKS" AS IN PLURAL?

34:25.564 --> 34:28.397
UH, NO. SORRY, MAN.
I-I MEANT "PRANK."

34:29.738 --> 34:31.800
SKETCHY.

34:31.800 --> 34:33.642
THAT WAS GREAT, MAN.

34:33.642 --> 34:36.475
(Phoebe) LET'S JUST GO FOR
A LITTLE BIT. EVERYONE'S GOING.

34:36.475 --> 34:39.348
WHY WOULD I WANT TO GO TO
A PARTY AT DANNY DESAI'S HOUSE?

34:39.348 --> 34:40.649
MY BROTHER SAID THE PARTY
IS GOING TO BE EPIC.

34:40.649 --> 34:43.652
APPARENTLY, SOMETHING HUGE
IS GONNA HAPPEN.

34:43.652 --> 34:45.384
SAID WE'D ALL BE TALKING
ABOUT IT TOMORROW,

34:45.384 --> 34:48.617
AND THAT IT WOULD BE A NIGHT
THE SOCIO WOULD NEVER FORGET.

34:48.617 --> 34:49.858
OH! (gasps)

34:51.460 --> 34:53.692
AAH!

34:53.692 --> 34:55.764
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
THE WOMAN

34:55.764 --> 34:56.825
THAT DANNY...

35:08.407 --> 35:12.581
(Karen) THAT'S IT! OUT!
YOU GUYS, GET OUT!

35:12.581 --> 35:13.842
NOW!

35:15.844 --> 35:17.486
TURNS OUT TYLER...

35:17.486 --> 35:18.787
THAT WAS NUTS.

35:18.787 --> 35:20.749
WAS EXACTLY WHAT
I THOUGHT HE WAS.

35:20.749 --> 35:22.551
YOU ORGANIZED THIS,
DIDN'T YOU?

35:22.551 --> 35:25.394
NO, JO.
JO, OF COURSE I DIDN'T.
DON'T LIE TO ME.

35:25.394 --> 35:28.457
I SAW YOU FILMING IT.
YOU WERE SMILING.

35:28.457 --> 35:31.860
AND THE JUMP ROPES.
THAT WAS YOU, TOO, WASN'T IT?

35:31.860 --> 35:33.832
LOOK...

35:33.832 --> 35:35.764
WHEN PEOPLE SEE MY MOVIE,

35:35.764 --> 35:37.906
IT'S GONNA MAKE PEOPLE
SYMPATHIZE WITH HIM.

35:37.906 --> 35:39.708
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

35:39.708 --> 35:41.470
I WANT YOU TO LEAVE.

35:41.470 --> 35:43.342
I THINK WE HAVE
A LOT OF POTENTIAL.

35:43.342 --> 35:45.844
WE DID.
TOO BAD YOU BLEW IT.

35:48.347 --> 35:50.679
LESSON 14--

35:50.679 --> 35:53.752
"NEVER HOOK UP
IN FRONT OF A WINDOW."

35:53.752 --> 35:55.354
HOW YOU DOIN' THERE, WINO?

35:55.354 --> 35:57.856
(groans) GROSS.
ALCOHOL'S EVIL.

35:57.856 --> 36:00.789
RIGHT. I'M GONNA TAKE
THIS DRUNK GUY HOME.

36:00.789 --> 36:03.492
I'LL STAY, HELP YOU CLEAN UP.

36:03.492 --> 36:06.435
AFTER I STUMBLED OUT WITH JO...

36:07.696 --> 36:11.500
LACEY AND DANNY ENJOYED
SOME ALONE TIME.

36:13.542 --> 36:17.406
BUT THEY WEREN'T ACTUALLY
ALONE.

36:17.406 --> 36:21.850
THINGS GOT WEIRD
AND SUPER CREEPY.

36:23.552 --> 36:26.385
CHIEF MASTERSON FINALLY GOT
KAREN DESAI TO TALK.

36:26.385 --> 36:28.717
IT'S LATE, KAREN.

36:28.717 --> 36:32.561
I KNOW. THIS COULDN'T WAIT
TILL MORNING.

36:32.561 --> 36:34.793
OKAY.

36:34.793 --> 36:37.966
BUT IT WASN'T WHAT
HE EXPECTED TO HEAR.

36:37.966 --> 36:41.470
I KILLED REGINA CRANE.

36:52.811 --> 36:55.284
DANNY'S MOM HAD CONFESSED
TO KILLING REGINA.

36:55.284 --> 36:57.586
BUT NOBODY BELIEVED HER.

36:57.586 --> 37:00.589
ALL RIGHT, DANNY. WE'RE HOLDING
YOUR MOM FOR 48 HOURS.

37:00.589 --> 37:01.950
THEN WHAT?
AND THEN WE HAVE TO DECIDE

37:01.950 --> 37:03.592
IF WE'RE GONNA
FORMALLY CHARGE HER OR NOT.

37:03.592 --> 37:04.853
SO YOU THINK SHE WAS LYING?

37:04.853 --> 37:06.655
ANYTHING YOU CAN TELL ME

37:06.655 --> 37:08.697
ABOUT YOUR MOTHER
AND REGINA CRANE, DANNY?

37:08.697 --> 37:09.928
ANYTHING AT ALL?

37:09.928 --> 37:12.261
OH, THERE WAS PLENTY TO TELL.

37:12.261 --> 37:14.303
LESSON 15--

37:14.303 --> 37:16.735
"ALWAYS TELL THE TRUTH

37:16.735 --> 37:18.367
(AT SOME POINT)."

37:18.367 --> 37:20.869
(Danny) LOOK, YOU TOLD ME TO
TELL YOU EVERYTHING THAT I KNOW.

37:20.869 --> 37:22.010
WELL, THIS IS EVERYTHING.

37:22.010 --> 37:23.772
SO THIS WAS POSTMARKED...

37:23.772 --> 37:24.943
TWO DAYS BEFORE REGINA DIED.
YEAH.

37:24.943 --> 37:26.915
I DON'T BELIEVE KAREN WOULD
DO ALL THIS.

37:26.915 --> 37:29.618
SEND REGINA THREATENING LETTERS?
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

37:29.618 --> 37:31.680
WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT MY MOTHER
DID ANY OF THIS.

37:31.680 --> 37:32.981
BUT SOMEONE DID.

37:32.981 --> 37:34.723
SOMEONE OTHER THAN DANNY.

37:34.723 --> 37:37.386
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GUYS KEPT
ALL THIS FROM ME.

37:37.386 --> 37:39.788
AFTER AN APPEAL FROM DANNY...

37:39.788 --> 37:42.861
CHIEF MASTERSON'S CASE,
IT'S NOT...

37:42.861 --> 37:44.893
ALL ABOUT ME ANYMORE.

37:44.893 --> 37:46.995
PLEASE.

37:46.995 --> 37:48.867
DON'T GO. I NEED MY MOM.

37:49.968 --> 37:53.802
MRS. DESAI RETRACTED
HER CONFESSION.

37:53.802 --> 37:55.644
CHIEF MASTERSON
FINALLY CONSIDERED

37:55.644 --> 37:58.647
THAT SOMEBODY OTHER THAN DANNY
KILLED REGINA CRANE.

37:58.647 --> 38:01.910
I'M GONNA FIGURE OUT WHO KILLED
REGINA, NO MATTER WHO IT IS.

38:01.910 --> 38:04.683
JO'S STUCK BY YOU
THROUGH A LOT.

38:04.683 --> 38:06.885
SO HAS LACEY.

38:06.885 --> 38:08.717
GIVE THEM BOTH A CHANCE.

38:08.717 --> 38:10.058
BE HONEST WITH THEM.

38:11.790 --> 38:13.692
DANNY TOOK THE CHIEF'S WORDS
TO HEART.

38:13.692 --> 38:15.894
(Jo) HOW DID YOUR MOM GET
THE NECKLACE?

38:15.894 --> 38:17.966
FROM ME.

38:17.966 --> 38:19.468
(scoffs)

38:19.468 --> 38:21.870
I DID NOT TAKE THAT NECKLACE
FROM REGINA. I SWEAR.

38:21.870 --> 38:24.333
THE DAY AFTER SHE DIED, I JUST
FOUND IT. IT WAS IN MY LOCKER.

38:24.333 --> 38:25.474
YOUR LOCKER?!

38:25.474 --> 38:26.935
LACEY, I'M TELLING YOU
THE TRUTH.

38:26.935 --> 38:28.407
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO BELIEVE THAT?

38:28.407 --> 38:31.840
YOU LIED TO US
OVER AND OVER AGAIN, DANNY!

38:31.840 --> 38:33.912
WE'RE DONE.

38:33.912 --> 38:35.844
LACEY.

38:35.844 --> 38:37.946
JO, JUST LISTEN TO ME.
OKAY?

38:37.946 --> 38:39.087
CAN YOU JUST LISTEN TO ME,
PLEASE?

38:39.087 --> 38:41.420
CAN YOU LISTEN TO ME?!

38:41.420 --> 38:44.423
DANNY'S ISSUES
WERE JUST GETTING STARTED.

38:44.423 --> 38:46.395
REMEMBER WHEN
THE MASKED CREEPY GUY

38:46.395 --> 38:48.056
WAS RECORDING
DANNY AND LACEY'S HOOK UP?

38:48.056 --> 38:50.759
THAT VIDEO?

38:50.759 --> 38:52.931
THAT SHOWED UP IN MY IN BOX.

38:52.931 --> 38:55.404
THIS MATHLETE DOUG FILMED
YOU AND DANNY

38:55.404 --> 38:56.865
AFTER THE PARTY
AT DANNY'S HOUSE

38:56.865 --> 38:59.007
THROUGH A WINDOW...

38:59.007 --> 39:02.070
LIKE, BEING...
INTIMATE PHYSICALLY.
YEAH, OKAY. I GET IT.

39:02.070 --> 39:04.973
I SHAMED HIM,
BUT CLEARLY IT--IT DIDN'T TAKE.

39:04.973 --> 39:06.475
YOU SHOULD TRY
CONFRONTING HIM

39:06.475 --> 39:08.076
BECAUSE HE'S EXTREMELY
INTIMIDATED BY WOMEN.

39:08.076 --> 39:11.420
AND THEN THERE WAS
THE WHOLE SOCCER POISON THING.

39:11.420 --> 39:12.851
FOOD POISONING?

39:12.851 --> 39:15.083
INTENSE FOOD POISONING.

39:15.083 --> 39:16.755
NOW COLE'S PARENTS ARE
KEEPING ME UPDATED.

39:16.755 --> 39:18.857
IT LOOKS LIKE
HE'S GONNA BE OKAY.

39:18.857 --> 39:21.430
WELL, DESAI, WEREN'T YOU WORKING
OUT WITH HIM THIS MORNING?

39:21.430 --> 39:24.963
I ONLY ASK BECAUSE, UH,
I'M CURIOUS HOW HE SEEMED.

39:26.094 --> 39:28.066
YOU THINK SOMEONE DID THIS
TO HIM ON PURPOSE?

39:28.066 --> 39:29.768
(plastic bag crinkles)

39:29.768 --> 39:31.400
I FOUND THIS
IN THE WEIGHT ROOM TRASH.

39:31.400 --> 39:34.873
APPARENTLY, A SMALL DOSE OF THIS
CRAP CAN MIMIC FOOD POISONING.

39:34.873 --> 39:37.876
YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE IN THERE
WITH COLE THIS MORNING.

39:37.876 --> 39:40.008
I'M GONNA NEED YOU TO
TURN IN YOUR JERSEY.

39:40.008 --> 39:44.382
DANNY'S FUTURE AT GREEN GROVE
DIDN'T LOOK GOOD,

39:44.382 --> 39:47.155
THANKS TO REGINA CRANE'S MOM
AND THE SCHOOL BOARD.

39:47.155 --> 39:48.987
I DIDN'T POISON COLE.

39:48.987 --> 39:51.059
PLEASE, YOU GOTTA BELIEVE ME.

39:51.059 --> 39:54.392
COACH CHANDLER AND COACH LARSON
TELL A VERY DIFFERENT STORY.

39:54.392 --> 39:56.064
YOU CAN'T JUST EXPEL DANNY.

39:56.064 --> 39:58.827
I MEAN, THERE MUST BE
SOME SORT OF RECOURSE HERE.

39:58.827 --> 40:00.929
WE COULD HAVE A HEARING.

40:00.929 --> 40:04.933
FINE. WE'LL HAVE THE HEARING
QUICKLY TOMORROW AFTERNOON.

40:04.933 --> 40:06.875
DOES THAT WORK FOR YOU,
MRS. DESAI?

40:06.875 --> 40:08.406
I GUESS IT HAS TO.

40:09.838 --> 40:13.411
CHIEF MASTERSONS' INVESTIGATION
TURNED UP SOME NEW LEADS.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.984
(Eddie) THE APARTMENT WAS
IN VIKRAM DESAI'S NAME,

40:15.984 --> 40:17.586
BUT THE RENT WAS BEING PAID
OUT OF A LOCAL BUSINESS ACCOUNT

40:17.586 --> 40:19.948
FOR A COMPANY CALLED
MARNA INC.

40:19.948 --> 40:22.050
TWO DAYS BEFORE REGINA CRANE
WAS MURDERED,

40:22.050 --> 40:24.893
$2,000 WAS WITHDRAWN
FROM THAT ACCOUNT.

40:24.893 --> 40:26.895
THE EXACT AMOUNT
THAT WAS SENT TO REGINA.

40:26.895 --> 40:28.997
WELL, WELL. LOOK AT THAT.

40:28.997 --> 40:30.929
BUT WHEN HE ASKED
THE MAYOR OF GREEN GROVE

40:30.929 --> 40:32.661
FOR A LITTLE HELP,

40:32.661 --> 40:34.002
HE DIDN'T GET ANY.

40:34.002 --> 40:35.063
THE PRIME SUSPECT

40:35.063 --> 40:38.006
IS OUT THERE POISONING
OTHER STUDENTS.

40:38.006 --> 40:39.568
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
ABOUT HIM?

40:39.568 --> 40:41.209
I'M JUST TRYING
TO SOLVE THIS CASE.

40:41.209 --> 40:43.011
WELL, YOU'RE NOT DOING
A VERY GOOD JOB.

40:44.973 --> 40:46.875
DANNY'S FATE ULTIMATELY
CAME DOWN TO THE TESTIMONY

40:46.875 --> 40:49.548
OF SUPPORTERS VERSUS HATERS.

40:49.548 --> 40:52.020
TO BE HONEST, I DIDN'T REALLY
HAVE ANYTHING AGAINST THE GUY.

40:52.951 --> 40:55.524
YOU HAD A PHYSICAL CONFRONTATION
WITH MR. DESAI.

40:55.524 --> 40:56.985
TELL US ABOUT THAT.

40:56.985 --> 40:58.527
IT WAS PRETTY SCARY.

40:58.527 --> 41:02.090
THE LOOK IN HIS EYES
WHEN HE PUNCHED ME WAS INTENSE.

41:02.090 --> 41:04.693
I STILL THINK ABOUT IT
SOMETIMES.

41:04.693 --> 41:06.034
OKAY.

41:07.235 --> 41:09.067
THANK YOU, MR. YATES.

41:09.067 --> 41:11.199
EVEN AFTER ALL THE LIES,

41:11.199 --> 41:14.002
JO FELT SOMEONE
HAD TO SPEAK UP FOR DANNY.

41:14.002 --> 41:16.875
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
A LOT SINCE HE GOT BACK.

41:16.875 --> 41:18.677
IT HASN'T ALL BEEN EASY.

41:18.677 --> 41:20.609
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
IT HASN'T ALL BEEN EASY?

41:20.609 --> 41:22.250
TO BELIEVE IN.

41:22.250 --> 41:25.113
TO TRUST HIM.

41:25.113 --> 41:27.586
BUT IN THE END,
I CAN'T TURN AWAY FROM HIM.

41:27.586 --> 41:31.019
HE'S JUST
THE MOST AMAZING PERSON.

41:31.019 --> 41:33.622
I MEAN, HOW COULD HE BE
THIS BAD PERSON

41:33.622 --> 41:35.624
IF I'M FALLING--

41:35.624 --> 41:37.696
(murmuring)

41:37.696 --> 41:40.929
THANK YOU SO MUCH, JO.
YOU MAY SIT DOWN NOW.

41:42.701 --> 41:45.033
JO WAS PUBLICLY EMBARRASSED,

41:45.033 --> 41:48.076
BUT LACEY TRIED TO KEEP
HER EMBARRASSMENT PRIVATE.

41:48.076 --> 41:50.008
LET ME EXPLAIN EXACTLY WHAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN HERE.

41:50.008 --> 41:51.980
YOU'RE GONNA DELETE THAT VIDEO
FROM YOUR PHONE,

41:51.980 --> 41:52.981
AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA
MAKE A LIST

41:52.981 --> 41:54.713
OF EVERYONE THAT YOU SENT IT TO,

41:54.713 --> 41:56.244
AND YOU'RE GONNA DELETE IT
FROM THEIR PHONES.

41:56.244 --> 41:57.946
AND IF YOU DON'T,
IT'LL BE MY MISSION

41:57.946 --> 42:00.989
TO MAKE THE REST OF
YOUR HIGH SCHOOL HURT BADLY.

42:00.989 --> 42:01.920
GOT IT?

42:01.920 --> 42:03.892
YEAH.

42:03.892 --> 42:06.224
HEY! CHIEF MASTERSON.

42:06.224 --> 42:07.726
AND THE CHIEF'S CASE
TOOK ANOTHER TURN.

42:07.726 --> 42:09.527
THIS IS MARILYN ROSSI.

42:09.527 --> 42:12.601
MARILYN, I WANT YOU TO MEET
CHIEF OF POLICE KYLE MASTERSON.

42:12.601 --> 42:14.062
GREAT TO MEET YOU, CHIEF.
ROSSI.

42:14.062 --> 42:16.264
SHE'S A TOP-NOTCH INVESTIGATOR
CURRENTLY WORKING

42:16.264 --> 42:18.767
FOR A WELL-RESPECTED
PRIVATE FIRM.

42:18.767 --> 42:21.209
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE
THE AUTHORITY--
ACTUALLY, I DO.

42:21.209 --> 42:24.212
I SPOKE TO ALBANY, AND THEY
WANNA SEE THIS CASE SOLVED,

42:24.212 --> 42:26.074
ALONG WITH EVERYONE ELSE.

42:26.074 --> 42:27.576
START AT THE BEGINNING.

42:27.576 --> 42:29.077
WALK ME THROUGH
THE NIGHT OF THE CRIME

42:29.077 --> 42:31.980
AND SHOW ME EVERYTHING YOU HAVE
ON DANNY DESAI.

42:33.081 --> 42:35.123
SO NOW
THINGS ARE WORSE FOR DANNY

42:35.123 --> 42:36.925
THAN EVER BEFORE.

42:36.925 --> 42:38.987
FINAL LESSON--

42:38.987 --> 42:41.029
"EVENTUALLY, STUFF GETS REAL."

42:41.029 --> 42:42.791
(Danny) PUT IT RIGHT THERE.
PARK IT.

42:42.791 --> 42:44.192
UH... (laughs)
HERE'S WHAT KNOWING DANNY
HAS TAUGHT ME.

42:44.192 --> 42:46.034
ALL RIGHT!

42:46.034 --> 42:48.336
WHEN YOU MAKE MORE ENEMIES
THAN FRIENDS...

42:48.336 --> 42:50.238
DANNY, I'M--I'M SO SORRY.

42:50.238 --> 42:51.900
THINGS DON'T TURN OUT WELL.

42:51.900 --> 42:54.643
THE SCHOOL BOARD HAS DECIDED
TO UPHOLD THE EXPULSION.

42:54.643 --> 42:56.745
AND SECRETS

42:56.745 --> 42:59.147
ARE TOUGH TO KEEP,
UM... SECRET.

42:59.147 --> 43:00.949
(boys laugh)

43:03.081 --> 43:07.686
AND WHEN YOU LIE TO FRIENDS
OVER AND OVER AGAIN,

43:07.686 --> 43:08.917
PEOPLE GET HURT.

43:08.917 --> 43:10.959
JO? WHAT'S WRONG?

43:10.959 --> 43:13.992
ESPECIALLY THE ONES
YOU CARE ABOUT.

43:16.164 --> 43:19.027
THERE'S STILL A LOT
I HAVEN'T LEARNED ABOUT DANNY,

43:19.027 --> 43:21.830
LIKE WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH HIS DAD?

43:23.071 --> 43:25.073
DID DANNY ACTUALLY KILL REGINA?

43:25.073 --> 43:27.175
(Kyle on TV) THIS UNTHINKABLE
CRIME WILL NOT GO UNPUNISHED.

43:27.175 --> 43:30.338
(Rico) HOW DOES IT ALL CONNECT
TO HIS PAST?

43:31.780 --> 43:37.345
SO IF YOU ASK ME NOW,
"WHO IS DANNY DESAI?"

43:37.345 --> 43:40.949
HONESTLY, I'M STILL NOT SURE.

43:40.949 --> 43:43.291
MAYBE THAT'S COVERED
IN THE NEXT LESSON.
