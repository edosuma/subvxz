00:32.100 --> 00:35.140
(winding)
(metallic tapping)

00:36.770 --> 00:38.770
(slow music)

00:40.274 --> 00:42.314
(light music)

01:12.506 --> 01:14.176
(ding!)

01:15.809 --> 01:17.679
(music)

01:36.664 --> 01:38.534
(whinnying)

01:44.538 --> 01:46.708
(ding!)

01:50.010 --> 01:52.210
(music fading)

01:53.181 --> 01:56.121
- Hands above the covers!
- Oh!

01:59.820 --> 02:03.460
- Was I...? It wasn't you.
It was the dreaming you.

02:03.524 --> 02:05.094
Keep your "yous" separate

02:05.159 --> 02:08.729
and you'll never have anything
to apologize for, possum.

02:10.198 --> 02:12.798
So what shall we girls
tackle today?

02:12.866 --> 02:15.296
- I wanna make muffins.

02:15.369 --> 02:17.869
- Well, wash up and we'll see.

02:18.872 --> 02:20.742
- Oh!

02:23.377 --> 02:25.877
(sighing in contentment)

02:26.947 --> 02:28.747
(soft music)

02:35.656 --> 02:37.426
(birdsong)

02:39.760 --> 02:41.660
(soft music)

02:47.401 --> 02:52.111
Oh... We don't have any vanilla,
do we?

02:52.172 --> 02:54.612
- No. Make them without.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.505
- Uh... but...

02:56.577 --> 02:58.777
the book says we need it.

02:58.846 --> 03:01.216
They won't turn out
the way they're supposed to.

03:01.282 --> 03:04.752
- Most things in life don't turn
out the way they're supposed to.

03:04.818 --> 03:07.718
In fact, that will be today's
lesson:

03:07.788 --> 03:09.588
Anticipointment.

03:09.657 --> 03:11.827
- Oh! Fun!

03:11.892 --> 03:15.302
- When we expect too much
out of life,

03:15.363 --> 03:17.733
we get smacked
by disappointment.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.228
- Oh.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.470
- Words to live by.

03:25.239 --> 03:27.309
(soft music)

03:39.853 --> 03:41.493
(ding!)

03:45.793 --> 03:47.233
(sighing)

03:47.295 --> 03:50.755
Why can't you leave them at
the back of the church on Sunday

03:50.831 --> 03:53.071
and people can grab them
when they leave?

03:53.133 --> 03:55.243
- Because they're warm now.

03:55.303 --> 03:58.073
People have been so kind to us.

03:58.138 --> 04:00.708
It's time we repay them.

04:00.774 --> 04:03.244
- But so many of them haven't.

04:03.311 --> 04:05.781
- But so many of them have.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.676
I won't be long.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.853
I won't be long.

04:14.154 --> 04:16.423
- Fine.

04:16.490 --> 04:18.390
But head down at all times,

04:18.459 --> 04:20.988
and whatever words
come out of their mouths

04:21.060 --> 04:22.931
are not to be listened to.

04:22.996 --> 04:24.866
- Yes, Mum.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.602
I'm 24.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.597
- Well, if you want to see 25,

04:28.669 --> 04:32.269
you'll come back as soon
as they snatch that last muffin.

04:32.340 --> 04:34.940
(young woman sighing)
- Deal.

04:35.008 --> 04:36.878
There and back.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.548
Mwah!

04:40.348 --> 04:42.378
(giggling)

04:56.364 --> 04:58.404
(winding)

04:59.733 --> 05:01.103
(ticking)

05:01.168 --> 05:02.968
(soft music)

05:03.036 --> 05:04.966
(birdsong)

05:05.038 --> 05:07.408
(light, upbeat music)

05:41.875 --> 05:45.005
- Oh, Claire!
What a treat seeing you.

05:45.078 --> 05:47.008
I'm surprised you're out.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.920
- I couldn't keep these
to myself.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.921
- Oh.

05:52.986 --> 05:55.016
They smell amazing!

05:55.088 --> 05:57.018
Thank you, Claire.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.690
- Anytime!

05:58.759 --> 06:01.029
- Oh, so she's okay,
your mother?

06:01.094 --> 06:02.764
- Better than ever.

06:02.830 --> 06:06.170
- Oh, she's very lucky
to have you, you know.

06:06.233 --> 06:08.843
- I'd do anything for her.

06:08.902 --> 06:12.542
- I wish my children were here
to take care of me.

06:12.606 --> 06:15.436
Too busy complicating
their own lives

06:15.509 --> 06:17.809
to realize where they're needed.

06:17.878 --> 06:22.278
When my husband died,
I was at his bedside,

06:22.349 --> 06:25.219
holding a picture
of our children.

06:25.285 --> 06:27.755
Oh, well,
she's just lucky, is all.

06:27.821 --> 06:30.221
Thank you for the muffin,
Claire.

06:30.290 --> 06:32.430
- My pleasure!
- Oh!

06:34.428 --> 06:36.128
Have a great day.

06:36.196 --> 06:37.796
- You, too.

06:37.865 --> 06:40.795
(giggling)
- Off I go!

06:40.868 --> 06:42.838
(chuckling)

06:51.011 --> 06:52.411
- Yes?
- Hi.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.650
Are your parents home?

06:54.715 --> 06:56.545
(woman): Who is it, baby?

06:56.617 --> 06:59.047
- It's that girl
from down the street.

06:59.119 --> 07:01.249
- Shhh.
Stay quiet and she'll leave.

07:01.321 --> 07:04.961
- I don't like her.
How could you? She's crazy.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.685
Now shhh.

07:09.963 --> 07:12.603
- Mom?
(muffled screaming)

07:12.666 --> 07:15.796
(crying)
- Stay off my damn porch!!

07:18.138 --> 07:20.768
(brakes screeching)
(exclaiming)

07:20.841 --> 07:24.041
- Stay home, freak show!
(Claire crying)

07:33.186 --> 07:35.056
- Are you okay?

07:37.858 --> 07:40.628
Oh, my... give me your arm.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.304
- Oh...
(grunting)

07:42.362 --> 07:44.202
Oh...

07:46.534 --> 07:48.904
- Come on, let's get you inside.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.310
- Hey...

07:58.378 --> 08:00.648
it's 14108 Pinewood.

08:00.714 --> 08:04.284
- Well, yeah.
- I have a muffin for here.

08:04.351 --> 08:06.221
- I'm sure you do.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.860
Oh, crap.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.392
Here.

08:11.191 --> 08:14.361
Hold your nose like this.
- Oh.

08:14.427 --> 08:16.657
- Go sit inside.
- Okay.

08:21.201 --> 08:25.111
- Well, it looks like you've got
everything under control here.

08:26.239 --> 08:28.039
- Who's that?

08:28.108 --> 08:29.938
She's gorgeous.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.409
- No one.

08:34.481 --> 08:37.621
You should still
probably ice that.

08:37.684 --> 08:41.044
- Okay. May I see your room?

08:41.121 --> 08:43.160
- Uh... I guess.

08:43.222 --> 08:46.893
Just don't bleed on shit.
- I have a tampon up my nose.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.600
- Yeah, I can see that.

08:49.663 --> 08:52.133
(funky music)
(woman moaning)

08:53.200 --> 08:54.530
(moaning)

08:54.602 --> 08:56.372
Oh...

08:56.436 --> 08:58.636
Churn me like butter.

08:58.706 --> 09:03.076
You're my favourite cousin!

09:03.143 --> 09:05.713
Ah!! Ah!!

09:05.779 --> 09:07.919
(exclaiming)

09:10.283 --> 09:12.093
- Wow!

09:12.152 --> 09:14.152
I love this.

09:14.955 --> 09:18.185
I'm only allowed
to put up things that I create.

09:18.258 --> 09:21.798
- That's cool.
That's really cool.

09:21.862 --> 09:24.702
- I want a map like that.

09:24.765 --> 09:28.235
Have you been
to all those places?

09:29.369 --> 09:32.469
- My uncle's been
to all the pins that are red.

09:33.440 --> 09:37.310
All the blue pins are the places
I'm gonna get to someday.

09:41.882 --> 09:44.252
- Do you have anymore ice?

09:44.317 --> 09:46.187
- Yeah, sure, one second.

09:56.129 --> 09:58.599
(door opening)
(man): I'm home!

09:58.666 --> 10:01.266
- In the kitchen.
I have someone over.

10:01.334 --> 10:03.674
- Oh?

10:03.737 --> 10:06.267
Oh, it's you. Hello, Claire.

10:06.339 --> 10:08.509
- Hello, Pastor Paul.

10:08.575 --> 10:10.275
- You... you okay there?

10:11.679 --> 10:13.779
- Oh, I... I ran into a tree.

10:13.847 --> 10:16.277
- Well, I hope
you taught it a lesson.

10:16.349 --> 10:18.349
(laughing)

10:21.321 --> 10:23.961
You know, Claire, your mom's
probably worried sick.

10:24.024 --> 10:26.494
Let me drive you home.
- That would be swell.

10:26.559 --> 10:30.029
- Danielle, I'm gonna
give your friend a ride home!

10:30.097 --> 10:31.967
You wanna come with?!
- Nah.

10:32.032 --> 10:35.302
- We can stop and get
some chicken on the way home!

10:35.368 --> 10:37.638
- No, Paul.
- Oh...

10:37.705 --> 10:40.065
(chuckling)
Let's go Claire.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.080
- Okay. Ah...

10:45.879 --> 10:48.649
What's your favourite bird?

10:48.716 --> 10:51.916
- My favourite bird?
I've, uh...

10:52.886 --> 10:54.986
...never really given it
much thought.

10:55.055 --> 10:57.185
(chuckling)
Ugh, pigeon.

10:57.257 --> 10:58.987
No.

10:59.059 --> 11:00.389
Seagull.

11:00.460 --> 11:01.930
- Why?

11:01.995 --> 11:04.525
- I don't know. You?

11:05.365 --> 11:08.865
- I don't have one.
Birds scare me.

11:08.936 --> 11:11.966
- Birds scare your mom, Claire.

11:14.574 --> 11:16.584
Listen, um...

11:16.643 --> 11:18.883
Okay - ahem - how would you...

11:18.946 --> 11:23.346
like to represent the parish
at the annual...

11:23.416 --> 11:26.886
Pump Up the Jamboree
Youth Ministry Conference?

11:28.922 --> 11:31.592
- Why me?
= Because you'd be perfect.

11:31.658 --> 11:34.688
And - ahem - it would be a sin

11:34.762 --> 11:37.502
to turn something like this
down.

11:37.564 --> 11:39.434
- Oh, wow.

11:42.435 --> 11:44.635
I... I... couldn't.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.874
- Yes, you could. And you will.

11:46.940 --> 11:49.340
Even if your mother
doesn't agree.

11:49.409 --> 11:50.839
- Can she come?

11:50.911 --> 11:53.451
- No, Claire, she can't.

11:53.513 --> 11:55.723
- Oh.

11:55.783 --> 11:58.023
Will you be there?

11:58.786 --> 12:01.886
- Definitely.
- Then yes.

12:01.955 --> 12:05.455
Yes, I'm going to come.

12:05.525 --> 12:06.985
- Excellent.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.160
Well, then it's settled.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.470
You still live
at your grandparents' house?

12:12.532 --> 12:15.702
- It's ours now.
- Oh?

12:15.769 --> 12:18.939
- They signed everything over.

12:19.006 --> 12:22.236
- You ever go visit them?
- It's too far.

12:22.309 --> 12:25.049
- Fifty miles is not far,
Claire.

12:25.112 --> 12:27.752
- That's a world away.

12:27.815 --> 12:29.875
- Well...

12:29.950 --> 12:32.950
here... we... are.

12:38.125 --> 12:40.355
- Thank you, Pastor Paul.

12:41.128 --> 12:42.658
- You're welcome, Claire.
And, um...

12:42.729 --> 12:45.029
would you do me a favour?
Would you...

12:45.098 --> 12:47.868
say hello to your mom for me?

12:47.935 --> 12:49.795
- I always do.
- Thanks.

12:51.004 --> 12:53.374
- Okay, bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

12:58.678 --> 13:01.078
(knocking)
Jesus Christ!

13:04.517 --> 13:05.917
Yes?

13:05.986 --> 13:08.516
- I forgot to offer you
my muffin.

13:08.588 --> 13:11.258
I made it nice and moist
for you.

13:11.324 --> 13:14.494
I even got
the neighbour's zucchini in it.

13:15.195 --> 13:17.595
- Thank you, Claire. That's...

13:17.664 --> 13:19.904
Thank you.

13:21.701 --> 13:22.941
- Okay.
- Okay.

13:23.003 --> 13:26.673
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye. Oh, uh, Claire?

13:26.739 --> 13:29.139
I think, uh, the bleeding has...

13:29.209 --> 13:30.639
stopped.

13:30.710 --> 13:33.180
- Thanks.

13:33.246 --> 13:34.506
Bye-bye.

13:34.581 --> 13:36.421
- Bye-bye.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.417
(soft music)

13:54.067 --> 13:55.837
(sniffling)

13:55.903 --> 13:57.843
(soft music)

13:57.905 --> 13:59.665
(sighing)

13:59.739 --> 14:01.569
(sniffling)

14:04.912 --> 14:06.852
(sniffling)

14:24.497 --> 14:26.297
- Oh...

14:27.767 --> 14:30.337
Oh! They loved them!

14:30.403 --> 14:32.313
They loved them!

14:37.744 --> 14:39.984
(soft music)

15:19.519 --> 15:21.749
Oh! Hey!!
(honking)

15:21.821 --> 15:24.661
(screaming)
(gasping)

15:24.724 --> 15:26.564
- No! No!!

15:26.626 --> 15:29.856
No! Look what you did,
you idiot!

15:29.929 --> 15:32.399
- Uh, is it okay?

15:32.465 --> 15:35.765
- No, it's not okay! You're
gonna have to replace this!

15:35.835 --> 15:38.005
It's a fucking vintage camera!

15:38.071 --> 15:39.671
- I have glue.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.681
- Go. Just go!

15:43.743 --> 15:45.613
- Uh...

15:45.678 --> 15:47.108
I feel bad.

15:47.180 --> 15:50.480
- You should.
- Well, I... I do.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.120
- Good.

15:52.185 --> 15:54.385
- It was a mistake.

15:54.454 --> 15:55.724
- Just like you!

15:58.391 --> 16:00.391
(crying)

16:02.996 --> 16:05.026
(sobbing)

16:06.299 --> 16:09.199
(birdsong)
- ...and with that...

16:09.269 --> 16:13.269
comes a huge degree
of responsibility.

16:13.340 --> 16:18.510
Now, we often think of ourselves
are scions of free will,

16:18.578 --> 16:20.078
of...

16:20.147 --> 16:21.807
choice, of...

16:21.881 --> 16:23.681
personal desire.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.990
Now, that simply isn't the case.

16:26.053 --> 16:28.123
Every moment we experience

16:28.188 --> 16:31.818
contains not only a series
of consequences,

16:31.891 --> 16:36.401
but is also the product
of a predetermined blueprint

16:36.463 --> 16:39.603
set out for us by our Good Lord.

16:39.666 --> 16:43.266
Now, as much
as we want to fight the notion,

16:43.336 --> 16:46.036
nothing in this life is random.

16:46.106 --> 16:47.666
Each situation we encounter

16:47.740 --> 16:51.980
brings us closer to the truth
of our existence.

16:52.045 --> 16:54.075
And it is our responsibility

16:54.147 --> 16:57.347
to suffer the consequences
of our actions.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.015
Now thank you.

17:00.087 --> 17:03.017
Thank you for coming
and God bless.

17:03.756 --> 17:06.126
(doorbell ringing)

17:09.262 --> 17:11.531
- So how do I get you
a new one?

17:11.598 --> 17:13.028
- What, my camera?

17:13.099 --> 17:14.670
It's no use.

17:14.733 --> 17:17.844
- No.
I have a responsibility to you,

17:17.904 --> 17:20.114
and to fixing your camera.

17:20.173 --> 17:22.042
- Yeah, yeah, you do.

17:22.108 --> 17:24.479
- So what do I do?

17:25.278 --> 17:26.678
- The store's closed today.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.776
I'll meet you at your place
tomorrow.

17:28.848 --> 17:30.448
You can hook me up then.

17:30.517 --> 17:32.117
- What time?
- Say 10:00?

17:32.185 --> 17:34.285
- And how much money do I need?

17:34.354 --> 17:36.394
- Fifty bucks,
but bring more to be safe.

17:36.456 --> 17:38.786
- Deal.
- Deal.

17:38.858 --> 17:42.628
And hey. Your muffin
was freakin' delicious.

17:42.695 --> 17:46.325
- That was for your dad.
- I'll see ya tomorrow.

17:51.070 --> 17:54.970
- I said hello, Mum! Mum?

17:55.041 --> 17:57.511
- Not now, Claire.

17:58.811 --> 18:01.211
This is pointless.

18:01.281 --> 18:03.121
- Do you need a hand?

18:03.983 --> 18:05.753
Mum?

18:05.818 --> 18:07.718
- Do you call this clean?

18:07.787 --> 18:09.387
- It looks clean.

18:09.456 --> 18:12.086
- Well, it isn't.
- Mum...

18:12.159 --> 18:15.229
tomorrow I have to fix
something I broke.

18:15.295 --> 18:17.325
- What did you break, honey?

18:17.397 --> 18:19.297
- Someone's camera.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.639
It's my responsibility.

18:22.702 --> 18:24.572
- Your responsibility...

18:24.637 --> 18:28.067
is to our family and this home.

18:28.141 --> 18:31.641
Anything else is self-serving...

18:32.812 --> 18:35.822
...and I won't allow it
under this roof.

18:38.185 --> 18:40.215
- Are you okay, Mum?

18:40.287 --> 18:42.217
- It's disgusting.

18:43.190 --> 18:44.920
It's filthy.

18:44.991 --> 18:47.731
- The sermon was great, Mum.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.404
- Not now, Claire.

19:02.875 --> 19:04.875
(celestial music)

19:09.682 --> 19:13.322
- It is our responsibility
to suffer the consequences

19:13.386 --> 19:15.416
of our actions.

19:19.392 --> 19:21.162
(engine stalling)

19:21.228 --> 19:22.798
(sighing)

19:22.862 --> 19:26.172
- When was the last time
you used this thing?

19:26.233 --> 19:28.343
(engine stalling)

19:28.401 --> 19:30.171
Did you hear that?

19:30.237 --> 19:31.897
- No.

19:33.240 --> 19:36.080
(engine stalling, then starting)

19:36.876 --> 19:40.306
I don't know about this.
- This was your idea.

19:40.380 --> 19:43.850
I thought you wanted
to do the right thing.

19:43.916 --> 19:46.646
- I do. I do.

19:46.719 --> 19:50.619
I just... I've... I've...
never taken her car before.

19:52.425 --> 19:54.555
- We'll be back in no time.

19:54.627 --> 19:55.757
- Okay.

19:55.828 --> 19:58.998
I have to be back
before the timer goes off.

19:59.065 --> 20:00.695
- Uh...

20:00.767 --> 20:02.537
alright.

20:04.237 --> 20:06.237
(radio): Residents are asked
to keep an eye out

20:06.306 --> 20:07.836
for the alleged sex offender
whom,

20:07.907 --> 20:09.877
as a result of last Wednesday,
some are now calling

20:09.942 --> 20:13.152
the Diddler on the Roof.
The man is described as--

20:13.212 --> 20:14.652
- Gross.

20:14.714 --> 20:17.284
- So how long
is this gonna take?

20:17.350 --> 20:19.090
- Not long.

20:19.151 --> 20:20.891
- Stop.

20:22.121 --> 20:24.661
Stop!
- What?

20:36.135 --> 20:38.165
(seatbelt clicking)

20:38.237 --> 20:40.307
- Okay. Drive...

20:40.373 --> 20:42.073
Jeeves!

20:42.141 --> 20:44.281
- Okay, freak.

20:44.344 --> 20:47.214
- Gas levels acceptable,
Captain?

20:47.280 --> 20:51.080
- Assuming the gauge works,
we're at a quarter of a tank.

20:51.150 --> 20:53.490
- Attagirl! Eyes on the road.

20:53.953 --> 20:56.123
(radio): Another casualty
of the power outages

20:56.188 --> 20:58.828
from last month
was the local sperm bank.

20:58.891 --> 21:02.761
Due to their freezers not being
able to run at full efficiency,

21:02.829 --> 21:05.729
there was an estimated loss
of four-quadrillion sperm.

21:05.798 --> 21:07.928
We were able to find...
- This is weird.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.440
Can we listen to something else?

21:10.503 --> 21:13.213
- What do you wanna listen to?

21:13.272 --> 21:14.812
- Sound of the wind.

21:14.874 --> 21:17.814
- He's asking all male locals
to donate today.

21:17.877 --> 21:19.547
- Yay!

21:23.182 --> 21:25.722
(light music)
Ah...!

21:25.785 --> 21:27.385
Ah...

21:35.227 --> 21:37.297
(music)

22:00.387 --> 22:02.417
(ticking)

22:18.771 --> 22:20.611
(ding!)

22:27.947 --> 22:29.617
(knocking)

22:30.750 --> 22:33.420
- Hey, I gotta step out
for a moment

22:33.486 --> 22:35.186
to finalize
some Jamboree planning.

22:35.254 --> 22:37.364
Um... Tsk.

22:37.424 --> 22:40.164
Look... Danielle, uh...

22:40.226 --> 22:44.196
I would really like to sit down
and talk with you tonight.

22:44.263 --> 22:46.633
I... I found another bottle.

22:53.072 --> 22:55.782
Okay, well,
if you're ignoring me,

22:55.842 --> 22:58.012
then you probably won't hear

22:58.077 --> 23:01.977
that I left some money for food
on the fridge.

23:03.315 --> 23:05.815
- O...kay.

23:06.819 --> 23:08.559
Uh...

23:12.258 --> 23:13.458
- What's wrong?

23:13.526 --> 23:16.256
- I don't like this.

23:16.328 --> 23:18.258
- We're almost there.

23:18.330 --> 23:20.070
- Pull over.

23:20.132 --> 23:21.702
Pull over!

23:21.768 --> 23:24.898
Pull over. Pull... pull over.
Pull over.

23:24.971 --> 23:26.511
- Okay.

23:29.141 --> 23:31.141
Pull over. Pull over.

23:32.144 --> 23:33.614
Pull over.

23:33.680 --> 23:36.420
(Claire panting)
- Oh, my God, what?!

23:36.483 --> 23:38.853
(exclaiming)

23:40.186 --> 23:42.956
(exclaiming)

23:51.498 --> 23:53.428
(groaning)

24:04.511 --> 24:07.051
(Claire taking deep breaths)

24:08.180 --> 24:10.420
Are you okay?

24:10.483 --> 24:12.453
- Oh...

24:12.519 --> 24:15.189
Oh... I don't know.

24:17.189 --> 24:19.529
- Well... are you hungry?

24:19.592 --> 24:22.632
Did you eat anything today?

24:22.695 --> 24:25.055
- I'm always hungry.

24:47.386 --> 24:50.156
Mmm... good sandwich.

24:50.222 --> 24:52.222
Thanks. It's lettuce.

24:52.291 --> 24:54.331
- It's really good.

24:54.393 --> 24:56.103
- Good.

24:57.564 --> 24:59.234
- Mmm.

25:03.736 --> 25:06.336
- Hey, so, like...

25:06.405 --> 25:08.605
what's the deal with your mom?

25:08.675 --> 25:11.105
You know, like,
what's her thing?

25:12.545 --> 25:14.505
- What do you mean?

25:14.581 --> 25:16.781
She's... wonderful.

25:17.917 --> 25:20.187
- Dude, she keeps you locked up.

25:20.252 --> 25:22.222
- No, she doesn't.

25:23.255 --> 25:25.725
I chose to be home-schooled.

25:26.926 --> 25:29.596
- Let me at least
sit on your face

25:29.662 --> 25:32.362
if you're gonna go
all Pinocchio on me.

25:32.431 --> 25:34.471
(laughing)
- Gross.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.073
- I'm not judging.

25:36.135 --> 25:38.965
I'm just observing
with intense criticism.

25:40.607 --> 25:42.337
Like...

25:42.408 --> 25:44.538
like, what do you think
she's feeling right now,

25:44.611 --> 25:46.381
the fact
that you just took her car?

25:46.445 --> 25:48.145
Seriously?

25:50.082 --> 25:52.992
- I'm sure she's fine.
- Claire.

25:54.987 --> 25:56.457
- She is.

25:57.256 --> 26:00.656
- If you haven't noticed,
I'm not a fan of lying.

26:03.295 --> 26:04.995
- Okay, okay.

26:06.966 --> 26:09.896
She's probably
balling her face off.

26:09.969 --> 26:12.299
(sighing)
- Claire, that's insane.

26:12.371 --> 26:15.911
You are just taking your friend
to the next town over

26:15.975 --> 26:20.005
to buy her a new camera
from the one that you broke.

26:20.813 --> 26:23.583
What?
- You said friend!

26:23.650 --> 26:25.420
(Danielle snorting)
- Okay, okay,

26:25.484 --> 26:27.654
we're not going all that.

26:27.720 --> 26:30.420
Let's go.
We're almost to Deersmith.

26:30.489 --> 26:32.059
- Deersmith?

26:32.124 --> 26:34.094
That's where
my grandparents live.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.630
- No shit. Your mom won't be
mad at us for visiting them.

26:36.696 --> 26:38.326
Let's go.
- Oh!

26:38.397 --> 26:40.127
We can visit them?!

26:40.199 --> 26:42.599
- Yeah! Let's go!

26:42.669 --> 26:46.009
- Oh, my goodness,
that would be swell!

26:46.839 --> 26:49.809
- Were you dropped on your head
as a child?

26:50.509 --> 26:52.779
- No. Why?

26:52.845 --> 26:55.405
- Just saying,
the way you talk is so--

26:55.481 --> 26:57.751
- Refined?

26:57.817 --> 26:59.317
- Annoying.

26:59.385 --> 27:01.045
- Oh.

27:02.154 --> 27:07.234
- Hey, we're gonna make
a grandparent pit stop, okay?

27:08.227 --> 27:09.897
- Okay.

27:09.962 --> 27:12.362
- But first the camera.

27:12.431 --> 27:14.501
- Okay.

27:14.566 --> 27:16.466
- Claire...!

27:16.535 --> 27:18.365
(sobbing)

27:24.711 --> 27:27.381
Claire, don't do this to me!

27:32.251 --> 27:33.921
Please...

27:37.256 --> 27:39.386
I'm sorry!!

27:43.095 --> 27:45.255
I'm sorry!

27:45.932 --> 27:49.502
- Okay, now just follow my lead.

27:49.568 --> 27:52.198
- Roger that.

27:52.271 --> 27:54.211
- Yeah.

27:55.574 --> 27:57.014
- Hey.

27:57.076 --> 27:59.046
- Hey. Huh...
- Hey, I called this morning,

27:59.111 --> 28:03.381
and they said that they had
a Canon 310 XL on hold for me.

28:03.449 --> 28:05.319
- Oh, yeah, perfect.

28:05.384 --> 28:06.994
Huh, you're perfect.

28:07.053 --> 28:09.393
That's perfect, that's perfect.

28:09.455 --> 28:11.685
Perfect.

28:11.758 --> 28:13.688
- So can I get it?

28:13.760 --> 28:16.600
- Get what?
- The camera.

28:16.662 --> 28:20.232
- Oh, yeah, we have
a large variety of cameras.

28:20.299 --> 28:22.739
Do you know the brand?
- Canon.

28:22.802 --> 28:25.702
- Okay, Canon. And the model?

28:25.772 --> 28:29.212
- She told you, weirdo.
The 310 XL.

28:29.275 --> 28:33.305
- Oh, yeah, yeah, of course,
of course. One sex.

28:33.379 --> 28:35.109
Second, uh... Sex,

28:35.181 --> 28:37.881
I don't... Wah, if... if only.

28:37.950 --> 28:41.290
I mean, uh...
- Oh, oh... He's bizarro.

28:41.353 --> 28:43.363
- I know. He likes me.

28:43.422 --> 28:45.962
- Well, he shouldn't ignore you,
then.

28:47.593 --> 28:50.503
- Remind me to get you
a personal massager.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.662
- Mom has one of those.

28:52.731 --> 28:53.731
(chuckling)
- No doubt.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.900
- Oh, that's so nice of you.

28:55.968 --> 28:57.738
(sighing)
- Nope.

28:57.804 --> 28:59.344
Uh, sorry.

28:59.405 --> 29:02.975
- What? Uh, she said
they had it this morning.

29:03.042 --> 29:05.242
- Well, sorry, we don't.

29:05.311 --> 29:07.081
- Shit.

29:07.146 --> 29:10.516
- We do have this Beaulieu R8.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.222
- Yeah, how much is that?

29:12.284 --> 29:14.754
- Um, I can give it to you
for 65.

29:14.821 --> 29:17.821
- Fifty.
- I can't. My mom won't let me.

29:17.890 --> 29:19.390
- Aw.

29:19.458 --> 29:22.488
Look, pumpkin,
another home-schooler.

29:23.562 --> 29:26.072
- Okay, fine. Fifty. Cash.

29:26.132 --> 29:28.502
- Great. Fork it over, sister.

29:32.839 --> 29:35.609
And a roll of film. Both: 50.

29:35.674 --> 29:37.544
- I can't. I can't.

29:42.314 --> 29:45.784
Okay. You know, okay, here.
Uh...

29:45.852 --> 29:48.492
(laughing)
- Great. Have a nice day.

29:48.554 --> 29:49.894
- Okay. Two?

29:49.956 --> 29:51.586
I... No?
- Oh! No...

29:51.657 --> 29:53.387
(laughter)

29:54.861 --> 29:56.961
Aren't you gonna ask
for his number?

29:57.029 --> 29:59.869
- Pfft. Man,
I have so much to teach you.

29:59.932 --> 30:02.302
- No, you don't.
Mum's done a great job.

30:02.368 --> 30:04.468
- Yeah.
Let's hit the Raisin Ranch.

30:04.536 --> 30:06.306
- Okay.

30:23.890 --> 30:25.820
Hi.

30:28.861 --> 30:31.101
Uh... hello?

30:33.232 --> 30:36.172
- Greetings,
and welcome to Grasswinds.

30:36.235 --> 30:38.295
- When are your visiting hours?

30:38.370 --> 30:39.840
- 5 to 7.

30:39.906 --> 30:41.636
- Uh, a.m. or p.m.?

30:41.707 --> 30:44.907
- Either way, you're either
too late or too early.

30:44.977 --> 30:48.147
- Uh... we can wait.
- Wait, what?

30:48.214 --> 30:50.384
- You'll wait. We all wait.

30:50.449 --> 30:52.279
- Thank you.

30:54.453 --> 30:55.993
- Hmm.

30:57.924 --> 31:00.034
- We can't wait here that long.

31:00.092 --> 31:02.132
- We're here now.

31:03.930 --> 31:06.230
- Exactly.

31:06.298 --> 31:08.068
Excuse me?

31:10.302 --> 31:11.802
Yo!

31:11.870 --> 31:14.510
- Yes, my darling.

31:14.573 --> 31:16.283
- Do you have a restroom?

31:16.342 --> 31:18.042
- Grasswinds is a place of rest.

31:18.110 --> 31:20.080
We don't isolate it
to one room.

31:20.146 --> 31:23.276
But if you need
to filter your kidneys or...

31:23.349 --> 31:26.589
expunge your bowels,
down the hall, first left.

31:36.128 --> 31:37.628
(sighing contentedly)

31:37.696 --> 31:40.726
- I don't have to go.
- Neither do I.

31:40.799 --> 31:42.729
(music playing)
Look.

31:42.801 --> 31:45.241
- Oh!!

31:45.304 --> 31:48.774
I've never taken
a dance class before.

31:48.840 --> 31:51.610
- Do you see your grandparents?

31:53.579 --> 31:55.249
- No.

31:55.314 --> 31:58.354
I haven't seen them
since I was 12.

31:59.151 --> 32:01.921
- But you'd recognize them,
right?

32:01.988 --> 32:04.088
- Of course.

32:04.156 --> 32:06.826
I send them a picture of me
every birthday

32:06.892 --> 32:09.162
to keep me fresh in their minds.

32:10.462 --> 32:13.732
- Claire? Claire!
- Nana!

32:13.799 --> 32:15.829
- Oh...
- Nana!

32:15.901 --> 32:17.671
Oh!

32:18.604 --> 32:20.914
- Come here, Claire bear!
Come here!

32:20.973 --> 32:24.013
- Pop-Pop!
- Ah...!!

32:25.744 --> 32:29.054
Ah! Oh, look at you!

32:29.115 --> 32:31.275
(laughing)
- But...

32:31.350 --> 32:34.790
Mum said you had dementia
and that you could barely move.

32:34.853 --> 32:36.423
- Really?
- Catherine.

32:36.488 --> 32:39.558
- She has some nerve.
- Remember your exercises.

32:39.625 --> 32:41.155
- Mmm...

32:41.227 --> 32:42.687
Ah!
- What?

32:42.761 --> 32:46.171
- Your mother and I
have entirely different ways

32:46.232 --> 32:49.202
of moving through our journey
of existence.

32:49.268 --> 32:52.398
- Why would she say that
about you?

32:53.239 --> 32:55.709
- It's... complicated.

32:56.508 --> 33:00.078
But... look! Look at you!
I am so glad to see you!

33:00.146 --> 33:02.146
We have so much to talk about.

33:02.214 --> 33:04.954
Honey, there is a beautiful
garden in the back.

33:05.017 --> 33:07.117
Let's talk!
- Oh, that's a great idea.

33:07.186 --> 33:09.356
- Okay, okay!
(laughing)

33:09.421 --> 33:11.161
Oh!

33:11.223 --> 33:12.923
This is my friend,

33:12.991 --> 33:14.631
Danielle.
- Hey.

33:14.693 --> 33:16.703
Listen, I'll let you guys
do your thing.

33:16.762 --> 33:19.602
It sounds like you have a lot
to catch up on.

33:19.665 --> 33:22.465
Plus I need to take footage
of this place.

33:22.534 --> 33:24.844
- Well, thank you, dear,
but be careful.

33:24.903 --> 33:27.543
They don't allow cameras here.

33:27.606 --> 33:29.206
- Oh. Shhh.

33:29.275 --> 33:31.835
(giggling)
- Come on.

33:31.910 --> 33:34.280
- That's my friend.

33:34.346 --> 33:36.946
- She's very nice.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.575
- Danielle, I'm home! Finally.

33:38.650 --> 33:41.890
Sorry, it took longer
than I thought.

33:41.953 --> 33:44.123
(knocking)
Danielle?

33:53.765 --> 33:55.625
(soft music)

33:57.603 --> 33:59.313
(soft music)

34:08.480 --> 34:09.850
(sighing)

34:09.915 --> 34:12.315
(phone chiming)

34:14.886 --> 34:16.886
(soft music)

34:16.955 --> 34:19.155
(birdsong)

34:36.608 --> 34:38.737
- You get this
when you get older.

34:38.810 --> 34:41.080
(sniffling)
Oh, gosh.

34:41.147 --> 34:42.907
Ah...
(sniffling)

34:42.981 --> 34:45.021
Oh...

34:45.083 --> 34:47.092
- Hey.

34:47.152 --> 34:50.523
- Hey.
- You ready to go?

34:51.822 --> 34:53.833
(soft music)

34:58.464 --> 35:01.474
Everything okay?
- She's gonna be just fine.

35:01.533 --> 35:05.303
- You can visit us anytime.
- Anytime.

35:05.371 --> 35:08.741
- I will.
(grandmother chuckling)

35:10.176 --> 35:13.146
(sighing)
- Love to your mother.

35:13.212 --> 35:16.552
- Can we not talk about her,
please?

35:17.416 --> 35:20.546
- Oh, dinner... is on us.

35:21.187 --> 35:23.017
(Claire giggling)

35:23.088 --> 35:25.218
- Thanks, Pop-Pop.

35:27.359 --> 35:28.989
I don't wanna go.

35:29.060 --> 35:31.000
- Oh...
- Honey, we have to go.

35:31.062 --> 35:34.732
They're gonna wonder
where we are at karaoke class.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.570
- Awesome.

35:38.570 --> 35:43.240
- Oh, sunshine...
everything will be just fine.

35:46.212 --> 35:47.952
You keep an eye on her.

35:48.013 --> 35:49.783
- I will.
- Okay.

35:53.219 --> 35:55.589
- Uh, what she said.

36:03.061 --> 36:04.901
- You ready?

36:10.769 --> 36:12.599
(sighing)

36:13.772 --> 36:15.442
(sighing)

36:16.908 --> 36:19.008
(sighing)

36:19.077 --> 36:21.607
So what'd you guys talk about?

36:24.583 --> 36:27.453
- Can we just get out of here,
please?

36:28.787 --> 36:30.457
- Yeah, totally.

36:32.791 --> 36:34.631
Um... where?

36:37.429 --> 36:39.299
- I don't care.

36:40.432 --> 36:42.932
I just can't go home right now.

36:45.103 --> 36:46.813
- Okay.

36:54.280 --> 36:56.380
(sighing)

36:56.448 --> 36:58.478
- Give me strength.

37:28.980 --> 37:31.250
- Yes?
- It's me.

37:31.317 --> 37:33.247
It's Paul.

37:33.319 --> 37:35.849
Is, uh, is Claire home?

37:36.855 --> 37:38.415
- No.

37:38.490 --> 37:41.730
Someone stole my Claire
and my car.

37:41.793 --> 37:44.433
- What are you talking about?

37:44.496 --> 37:46.526
Open the door!

37:52.338 --> 37:54.008
- Ah...

37:56.875 --> 37:58.735
You've aged.

37:58.810 --> 38:00.950
- We both have.

38:03.315 --> 38:05.045
Can I come in?

38:10.989 --> 38:13.489
- I've lost her, haven't I?
- No.

38:13.559 --> 38:15.959
- Then why would she just leave
like that?

38:16.027 --> 38:19.127
- I think that you know
the answer to that.

38:19.197 --> 38:21.767
What did she say when she left?

38:21.833 --> 38:23.773
- She didn't tell me anything.

38:23.835 --> 38:27.135
She just said that she had
a responsibility

38:27.205 --> 38:29.475
to fix some broken camera.

38:29.541 --> 38:31.481
- Danielle.

38:31.543 --> 38:34.683
Look, I am sure
that they'll be back tonight.

38:34.746 --> 38:37.846
And I'll wait with you
until they are.

38:37.916 --> 38:39.746
(kettle whistling)

38:42.053 --> 38:44.123
Let me get that.

38:44.189 --> 38:46.789
- All... all... all we have
is English Breakfast.

38:46.858 --> 38:49.998
- It's... it's good to see you
and I am not here for the tea,

38:50.061 --> 38:51.661
Henrietta.
- Ah...

38:51.730 --> 38:54.200
we have a splash of milk,
thank God.

38:54.265 --> 38:57.665
Claire used all the milk
when she made her muffins--

38:57.736 --> 38:59.636
- Henrietta.
- And, um, sugar.

38:59.705 --> 39:02.235
You still take sugar, right?

39:02.307 --> 39:04.137
- Henrietta. Henrietta.

39:04.209 --> 39:06.749
Everything is gonna be okay.

39:07.946 --> 39:09.776
(soft music)

39:19.591 --> 39:22.231
- So, uh, what'd
your grandparents tell you?

39:22.293 --> 39:24.163
- Enough to make this feel

39:24.229 --> 39:27.469
like this is the best decision
I've ever made.

39:27.533 --> 39:31.843
- Amen, sister.
Anywhere in particular?

39:31.903 --> 39:33.843
- Like I said...

39:33.905 --> 39:35.835
I don't care.
(laughing)

39:35.907 --> 39:39.547
- We'll just go to the next gas
station and take it from there.

39:39.611 --> 39:41.911
- Sounds like a plan.

39:46.117 --> 39:48.117
(crickets chirring)

39:50.622 --> 39:52.062
(bell tinkling)

39:52.123 --> 39:53.863
- Restroom?

39:53.925 --> 39:55.325
- Back there.

39:55.393 --> 39:58.933
- Hey, hey, will you get me
chips, beef jerky and water?

39:58.997 --> 40:01.567
And coffee.
Two creams, no sugar.

40:01.633 --> 40:04.443
- Okay. Oh!

40:04.503 --> 40:06.613
- I might be a while.

40:14.312 --> 40:16.012
Hi.

40:17.483 --> 40:19.153
- Hi.

40:20.486 --> 40:23.886
- You know where you are?
- Now I do.

40:23.955 --> 40:27.055
- Well, that makes one of us.
(laughing)

40:27.125 --> 40:29.955
- There isn't anyone in there,
by the way.

40:30.028 --> 40:32.028
- Oh. Thanks.

40:41.840 --> 40:44.440
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

40:44.510 --> 40:47.480
- Do you have
any white "Zenvendel"?

40:47.546 --> 40:50.146
- Are you old enough?
- I sure am.

40:50.215 --> 40:52.045
I bought some earlier this week.

40:52.117 --> 40:55.247
- Oh, good for you.
It's in the back left.

40:55.320 --> 40:57.720
- Neato!
(laughing)

41:09.200 --> 41:10.970
- Hey, um...

41:11.036 --> 41:13.636
I'll throw in a couple
of free jerkies

41:13.705 --> 41:15.605
if you eat one real slow.

41:15.674 --> 41:18.044
- Oh, that's so sweet of you.

41:37.028 --> 41:39.768
- How far back can you put it?

41:43.101 --> 41:44.671
(gagging)

41:44.736 --> 41:46.496
Okay, that's enough.

41:46.572 --> 41:49.512
Um, that'll be... 15.75.

41:49.575 --> 41:51.235
- Okay.

41:56.247 --> 41:58.247
One, two,

41:58.316 --> 42:02.516
three, four, five, 15.

42:03.955 --> 42:05.255
Fifty...

42:06.257 --> 42:08.187
Sixty... 85.

42:08.259 --> 42:10.159
You owe me a dime.

42:13.832 --> 42:16.942
Oh.
(giggling)

42:18.269 --> 42:19.769
- Here ya go.

42:19.838 --> 42:22.438
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

42:22.507 --> 42:24.737
- Have a good day.
- You, too.

42:39.457 --> 42:41.157
- Hello.

42:41.226 --> 42:42.826
- Hi.

42:44.596 --> 42:48.196
I'm just waiting for my friend,
but I should probably pee too.

42:48.266 --> 42:51.166
(laughing)
- Yes, you probably should.

42:52.470 --> 42:54.210
- I like your guitar.

42:54.272 --> 42:56.612
- Thank you.
It's a ukulele, actually.

42:56.675 --> 42:59.905
- Oh, it's so cute.
Are you in a band?

42:59.978 --> 43:03.048
- No.
Nah, I'm just doing my thing.

43:03.114 --> 43:07.194
- Me too. Just doing my thing.
(laughing)

43:08.319 --> 43:10.589
Are you lost?

43:10.656 --> 43:12.586
- Sometimes.

43:12.658 --> 43:14.058
- Where you going?

43:14.125 --> 43:16.825
We're going
to the Pump Up the Jamboree.

43:17.663 --> 43:20.803
- No way.
That's where I'm going.

43:20.866 --> 43:22.296
Wh-where is it exactly?

43:22.367 --> 43:23.897
- Ah.

43:23.969 --> 43:25.339
Oh...

43:27.505 --> 43:29.205
It's right here.

43:35.513 --> 43:37.283
- Yeah.

43:37.348 --> 43:39.618
- Do you need a lift?

43:39.685 --> 43:41.685
- That would be great, yeah.

43:42.487 --> 43:45.457
- Ours is the station wagon
out front.

43:45.523 --> 43:46.963
Here, make yourself comfy.

43:47.025 --> 43:49.255
- This is amazing. Thank you.

43:49.327 --> 43:53.157
- I think she's pooing,
but I'll be real quick.

43:53.231 --> 43:55.071
- Excellent news.

43:58.870 --> 44:00.910
(toilet flushing)

44:10.515 --> 44:14.485
- Where'd that guy go?
- Outside. He's coming with us.

44:14.552 --> 44:17.092
- What?
- I gave him the keys.

44:17.155 --> 44:20.825
He's heading to the Jamboree!
- My dad's thing?

44:20.892 --> 44:23.492
- Yeah. He asked me to go
the other day.

44:23.561 --> 44:26.001
- And so now we're going?
- Yep.

44:26.064 --> 44:28.404
- Okay, FYI, it's kinda lame.

44:28.466 --> 44:30.966
- FYI, it's kinda perfect.

44:32.070 --> 44:34.440
- Do you even know
what FYI means?

44:34.505 --> 44:37.275
- Yes. Forgive your intentions.

44:37.976 --> 44:41.206
- Wow. Yeah, let's go with that.
So where is he?

44:41.279 --> 44:44.019
- In the car.
- You gave him the keys?!

44:44.082 --> 44:46.682
- Why not?
He's heading to the Jamboree!

44:46.752 --> 44:48.752
- Who does that?

44:50.822 --> 44:52.822
(phone ringing)

44:54.292 --> 44:56.062
- Claire!

44:56.127 --> 44:57.497
Oh...

44:57.562 --> 45:01.432
I don't need to explain anything
to you, Mother.

45:03.134 --> 45:04.874
Where?

45:04.936 --> 45:06.806
Is she safe?

45:09.107 --> 45:11.537
Is she safe?!
Is she still there?!

45:11.609 --> 45:13.439
Is she safe?!

45:14.780 --> 45:18.450
I do not need
to get into this with you!

45:20.451 --> 45:23.091
Ah!
(sighing)

45:23.154 --> 45:24.824
Ah.

45:32.964 --> 45:35.174
- You know any lyrics?

45:36.634 --> 45:38.474
- Of course I do.

45:41.807 --> 45:44.777
* And then the ship *

45:44.843 --> 45:47.053
* Came sailing to *

45:47.112 --> 45:49.612
* The course of long begotten **

45:49.680 --> 45:53.920
- Whoa, you're ridiculous.
- Uh, I think you mean fabulous.

45:53.985 --> 45:56.185
(Claire giggling)

45:57.055 --> 45:58.915
- You know,
I never got your names.

45:58.990 --> 46:00.460
- I'm Danielle.
And she's Claire.

46:00.525 --> 46:02.085
- Trevor.

46:02.160 --> 46:06.160
I really appreciate this.
- Oh, it's no problem at all.

46:06.231 --> 46:08.371
We're all going
to the same place, apparently.

46:08.433 --> 46:10.373
- Lucky me.

46:10.435 --> 46:11.835
- Lucky me.

46:11.903 --> 46:13.943
- Lucky us!
(laughing)

46:17.375 --> 46:19.105
- I'll drive.

46:24.850 --> 46:28.050
- There ya go.
- Oh, thank you.

46:35.626 --> 46:39.326
- Don't be ridiculous.
You'd be saving her.

46:39.397 --> 46:40.727
- From what?

46:40.798 --> 46:43.328
- From everything
that could harm her.

46:43.401 --> 46:44.801
(Paul sighing)

46:44.870 --> 46:48.110
- I can't go collect her
by myself, okay?

46:48.173 --> 46:50.743
She's 24 years old,
for godssake!

46:50.808 --> 46:52.278
- What are you saying?

46:52.343 --> 46:54.983
- You know exactly
what I'm saying.

46:55.046 --> 46:57.716
- Uh, uh. I can't. I can't.

46:58.516 --> 47:02.346
- Fine. Fine. Then you'll just
have to wait this out, then.

47:02.420 --> 47:05.990
- We'll call the cops.
- Call the cops?! And say what?

47:06.057 --> 47:08.027
- I don't know.
Whatever it takes.

47:08.093 --> 47:11.063
You're the pastor,
you know what to tell the...

47:11.129 --> 47:13.829
- How about looking you
right in the eye

47:13.899 --> 47:16.129
and telling you
that the only thing

47:16.201 --> 47:18.441
that makes a cat an indoor cat,

47:18.503 --> 47:20.743
is a lazy, self- centered,
obstinate owner.

47:20.805 --> 47:23.975
An owner who doesn't wanna deal
with the responsibility

47:24.042 --> 47:26.542
that that innocent cat
might just find out

47:26.611 --> 47:30.021
that the backyard
is not all that scary after all,

47:30.081 --> 47:32.551
but, instead,
is filled with beautiful,

47:32.617 --> 47:36.117
wonderful moments
that are ripe for exploration.

47:37.588 --> 47:39.318
If they're not back tonight.

47:39.390 --> 47:43.030
I will be in your driveway
at 9 a.m. sharp.

47:43.094 --> 47:45.534
Meet me there. Or don't.
Good night.

47:45.596 --> 47:47.596
- Use the back door.

47:51.602 --> 47:56.012
* Amazing grace *

47:56.074 --> 48:00.584
* How sweet the sound *

48:00.645 --> 48:05.015
* That saved a wretch *

48:05.083 --> 48:08.253
* Like me... *

48:08.319 --> 48:09.689
(laughter)

48:09.754 --> 48:13.764
* I once was lost *

48:13.824 --> 48:18.434
* But now am found *

48:18.496 --> 48:21.066
* Was blind *

48:21.132 --> 48:26.172
* But now I see... *

48:26.237 --> 48:28.437
- And now from the front seat!

48:28.506 --> 48:31.506
* A... grace... *

48:32.577 --> 48:34.147
* Was... *

48:34.212 --> 48:36.252
* Born... **

48:42.520 --> 48:44.360
(turning engine off)

48:45.156 --> 48:48.256
Okay, guys, seriously,
what is the plan?

48:48.326 --> 48:50.056
Where are we sleeping tonight?

48:50.128 --> 48:52.628
- I'm good with pitching a tent.
- Ah!

48:52.697 --> 48:54.097
- I bet you are.

48:54.165 --> 48:57.095
- I'm good with outside!
Let's sleep under the stars!

48:57.168 --> 48:58.568
- Well, I'm not.

48:58.636 --> 49:02.266
How much money do we have
between the three of us?

49:02.340 --> 49:05.280
- I've got, like, 30 bucks.
- Oh, it's okay.

49:05.343 --> 49:08.013
We can cover you.
- Claire?

49:08.079 --> 49:10.619
Can I have a word with you
outside, please?

49:10.681 --> 49:13.381
- You know what?
I gotta find a tree anyway,

49:13.451 --> 49:15.951
so I'll just leave you two
to talk.

49:16.021 --> 49:17.591
- Oh, you should take this

49:17.655 --> 49:20.425
in case you get more
than you bargained for.

49:20.491 --> 49:23.491
- I'm good. Really.
(chuckling)

49:23.561 --> 49:25.061
- Okay.

49:29.734 --> 49:33.104
(door closing)
- What are you doing?

49:33.171 --> 49:34.911
- Helping out.

49:34.972 --> 49:36.512
- I don't know about this.

49:36.574 --> 49:38.614
- Are you okay?
(Danielle sighing)

49:38.676 --> 49:40.546
- What are we doing here?

49:40.611 --> 49:42.951
- Having an adventure!

49:43.681 --> 49:46.621
- Seriously, how much money
do we have?

49:46.684 --> 49:49.094
- Hmm...
Well, with what I took from home

49:49.154 --> 49:51.794
and what's left
of what Pop-Pop gave me,

49:51.856 --> 49:53.456
70 bucks, around?

49:53.524 --> 49:55.694
- That's not gonna be enough
for two rooms.

49:55.760 --> 49:58.500
- Why do you want to be
in another room?

49:58.563 --> 50:02.803
- For you.
He clearly wants to be with me.

50:02.867 --> 50:05.167
- But we know songs.

50:05.236 --> 50:08.036
- Well, I know
how to make music.

50:08.106 --> 50:10.036
- But you were way off-key.

50:11.076 --> 50:12.906
- I can hum.

50:12.977 --> 50:14.747
- I...

50:18.749 --> 50:21.019
Oh, do you like him?

50:21.086 --> 50:22.916
- Obviously.
- Oh!

50:22.987 --> 50:25.787
- Why? Do you?

50:25.856 --> 50:28.686
- No.
(knocking)

50:28.759 --> 50:30.699
- Good.

50:34.865 --> 50:37.635
(whispering): Great. Fantastic.

50:47.778 --> 50:49.778
(music playing)

50:55.453 --> 50:57.793
- Hello.
- I don't want watermelon.

50:58.589 --> 51:01.189
Oh, hey, sorry.
Must've dozed off.

51:01.259 --> 51:03.329
How can I help you?

51:03.394 --> 51:05.704
- We'd like a room
for the night.

51:05.763 --> 51:09.073
- Uh-huh. You guys going
to the full-moon party

51:09.134 --> 51:11.304
down in the woods?
- What? Full-moon party?

51:11.369 --> 51:14.639
- Oh, no, sir, we're here
for the Pump Up the Jamboree.

51:14.705 --> 51:16.765
- Oh, the Jesus thing?

51:16.841 --> 51:19.341
So three rooms, I'm guessing?

51:19.410 --> 51:22.610
- Two rooms. How much are they?

51:22.680 --> 51:24.620
- Sixty. Each.

51:24.682 --> 51:27.722
- Really? 'Cause the sign
outside says from 35.

51:27.785 --> 51:29.815
- Yeah, well,
those are all taken.

51:29.887 --> 51:34.017
- Shit. I mean, can't you just,
like, move the books around?

51:34.091 --> 51:35.731
The owner will never know.

51:35.793 --> 51:38.503
- Hmm.
Yeah, well, I'm the owner,

51:38.563 --> 51:41.573
so the owner will know.
Sorry, can't go under 60.

51:41.632 --> 51:44.202
I got horrible, unspeakable
vices that need fuelling.

51:44.269 --> 51:45.939
- It's a Monday.

51:46.003 --> 51:47.713
Are you really expecting
a crowd?

51:47.772 --> 51:51.382
- Full-moon party. Sorry.
Can I go back to sleep now?

51:52.177 --> 51:54.847
- Well, if we say no
to one room,

51:54.912 --> 51:56.582
you'll have lost 60.

51:56.647 --> 52:01.647
I know you offer two for 120,
but say you gave us two for 70,

52:01.719 --> 52:03.089
that's 35 each,

52:03.154 --> 52:05.894
then you're only 50 dollars shy
of what you're asking for,

52:05.956 --> 52:10.296
and losing 50 is way easier
to process than losing 60.

52:10.361 --> 52:12.561
Think of your horrible vices.

52:12.630 --> 52:15.200
- Okay, that just hurt my brain,

52:15.266 --> 52:17.666
but... you do have a point.

52:17.735 --> 52:21.465
I'm pretty sure
I could get a BJ for 70 bucks.

52:21.539 --> 52:23.969
Fine, 70 bucks, two rooms.

52:24.041 --> 52:25.811
- Sixty!
- Don't push it.

52:25.876 --> 52:27.606
- Guys, this is kind of you,

52:27.678 --> 52:30.518
but I can't justify staying
in a room all by myself.

52:30.581 --> 52:33.021
- No, you'll be with me.
- Sir, let's just take

52:33.083 --> 52:35.423
the one room, please.
- Huh?

52:35.486 --> 52:38.056
- I-I'll sleep on the floor.
- You guys are confusing

52:38.122 --> 52:40.292
the shit out of me.
What do you want?

52:40.358 --> 52:44.088
- One room, two beds, 50 bucks.
Deal?

52:44.161 --> 52:47.061
- Yeah. Fine. Whatever.

52:47.131 --> 52:50.771
Room 3. No smoking.

52:50.835 --> 52:52.335
- Oh, we're clean-living.

52:52.403 --> 52:54.513
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's what they all say.

52:54.572 --> 52:57.612
Then I find a condom
lodged in my neighbour's cat.

53:01.045 --> 53:03.645
It was so deep in there...

53:05.716 --> 53:10.146
- Oh!
Oh, wow, what a big bed!

53:10.221 --> 53:13.521
- Uh,
I'll get to the bottom of this.

53:22.733 --> 53:25.573
- Has anyone ever told you
how pretty you are?

53:26.937 --> 53:29.437
- My mum.
- Well...

53:29.507 --> 53:32.307
has a man ever told you
how pretty you are?

53:33.010 --> 53:36.580
- Yes.
Just before he was convicted.

53:36.647 --> 53:39.877
- You're not gonna make this
easy for me.

53:39.950 --> 53:41.890
- Sorry...?

53:41.952 --> 53:43.992
- You're very pretty.

53:47.292 --> 53:49.362
- Thanks.

53:49.427 --> 53:51.797
So are you.

53:54.432 --> 53:58.072
- Well... apparently
this is the last room, so...

53:58.135 --> 53:59.695
- Oh!
- Don't worry,

53:59.770 --> 54:02.540
you're not sleeping
on the floor, mister.

54:02.607 --> 54:05.707
- As long as it's hands
above covers, folks!

54:05.776 --> 54:09.876
- That's what my mum says
when I touch my no-no garden.

54:09.947 --> 54:11.677
(Claire laughing)

54:13.083 --> 54:15.323
- So, girl, boy, girl?

54:15.386 --> 54:16.786
- Works for me.

54:16.854 --> 54:19.824
- Oh!
We don't have any jammies.

54:20.858 --> 54:23.958
- No, no, we don't.

54:24.028 --> 54:26.498
- How about a couple of these?

54:29.033 --> 54:30.903
Huh?

54:32.370 --> 54:35.170
- Cool. Oh!

54:35.239 --> 54:37.379
(snorting)

54:38.476 --> 54:40.876
(slow rock music)

55:12.477 --> 55:14.577
(muffled screaming)

55:18.048 --> 55:20.148
(slow rock music)

55:20.217 --> 55:22.047
(screaming)

55:38.369 --> 55:40.969
(Danielle screaming)

55:42.006 --> 55:46.476
(slow instrumental rock version
of Amazing Grace)

55:50.415 --> 55:52.475
(music fading)

55:59.590 --> 56:01.630
(light music)

56:54.144 --> 56:55.884
Ow.

57:07.658 --> 57:09.758
Dear Lord,

57:09.827 --> 57:11.897
this adventure is confusing,

57:11.962 --> 57:15.102
but I know it's part
of your plan for me.

57:15.165 --> 57:17.535
(yipping in distance)

57:23.508 --> 57:25.608
Please help Mum.

57:25.676 --> 57:29.176
I love her...
but I'm frustrated.

57:29.980 --> 57:33.050
I do know I have to go
to the jamboree.

57:34.151 --> 57:36.751
Also, thank you so much
for Danielle.

57:36.821 --> 57:41.091
I had asked for a friend
for so long and she's perfect.

57:41.158 --> 57:44.258
Oh, and aren't we supposed
to celebrate your creations?

57:44.328 --> 57:47.128
I mean, if families traveled
thousands of miles

57:47.197 --> 57:48.797
to see Mount Rushmore,

57:48.866 --> 57:51.796
then certainly it's okay
to show my jelly jams.

57:51.869 --> 57:54.469
I'll take that as a yes.
It's hot in here.

57:54.539 --> 57:56.569
Thanks, God.

58:04.214 --> 58:06.084
Good night, Mum.

58:12.089 --> 58:13.919
(honking)

58:16.393 --> 58:18.103
(honking)

58:25.302 --> 58:27.612
(nervous breathing)

58:33.911 --> 58:36.611
- Oh. Oh, no. Oh, no.

58:36.681 --> 58:38.681
No... No, that's...

58:38.749 --> 58:40.689
No, that's... No, that's...

58:40.751 --> 58:43.191
(knocking)
No, that's different. No.

58:43.253 --> 58:44.993
(insistent knocking)

58:45.055 --> 58:46.515
No...

58:46.591 --> 58:48.531
- Argh! Enough! Henrietta?

58:48.593 --> 58:50.163
Henrietta!

58:50.227 --> 58:53.757
Fine! But if you don't get out
here right now and join me,

58:53.831 --> 58:55.531
I'm taking that car back
immediately.

58:55.600 --> 58:57.070
- I-I... I have a condition.

58:57.134 --> 58:59.004
- Argh!
Keep telling yourself that.

58:59.069 --> 59:02.669
And you find me one doctor
in town to support that myth.

59:02.740 --> 59:05.010
- Why are you being so mean
to me?

59:05.075 --> 59:07.745
- Mean?
Oh, you want me to be mean?

59:07.812 --> 59:11.282
I can be mean. Let's have
a little mean, shall we?

59:11.348 --> 59:13.478
Ahem. No one cares anymore,
Henrietta.

59:13.550 --> 59:15.290
People's lives have moved on.
Alright?

59:15.352 --> 59:18.292
Now you're just that weird lady
who stopped living

59:18.355 --> 59:20.755
to ensure that her daughter
doesn't live.

59:20.825 --> 59:23.755
Best you stay locked up
in your parents' house!

59:23.828 --> 59:26.028
That'll teach them a lesson!
(Henrietta moaning)

59:26.096 --> 59:28.526
- How dare you?! No!!!
- Come on.

59:28.599 --> 59:30.899
No, just... We're good.
You're fine.

59:30.968 --> 59:33.398
- No!! No!
- Here we go.

59:33.470 --> 59:35.710
- Ah...!!! No!!
- Prove me wrong.

59:35.773 --> 59:38.983
- Ah!!
- Prove me wrong! Here we go.

59:39.043 --> 59:42.713
(groaning)
Prove me wrong. Prove me wrong.

59:56.193 --> 59:57.863
- Trevor?

01:00:03.033 --> 01:00:04.333
Hello?

01:00:25.089 --> 01:00:27.289
Hey, what the hell happened?!

01:00:27.357 --> 01:00:30.287
- What? Wh-what happened?

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:32.360
- What happened last night?!

01:00:33.864 --> 01:00:36.334
- Where's Trevor?
- Yeah, where's Trevor?!

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:39.300
Your fucking tits come out
and he bolts!

01:00:39.369 --> 01:00:40.639
- Don't call them that.

01:00:40.705 --> 01:00:42.335
- What did you do?

01:00:42.406 --> 01:00:44.236
- Nothing.
- Nothing?!

01:00:44.308 --> 01:00:47.878
God, that's bullshit. You know,
he really liked me, okay?

01:00:47.945 --> 01:00:52.075
- Oh, wouldn't he have paid you
more attention, then?

01:00:52.149 --> 01:00:55.319
(scoffing)
- And I saw him first.

01:00:55.385 --> 01:00:58.485
I can't believe that you would
box-block me like that!

01:00:58.555 --> 01:01:00.615
- What does that even mean?

01:01:00.691 --> 01:01:03.091
Danielle, why are you so mad?

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.760
- Why are you
so fucking clueless?!

01:01:05.830 --> 01:01:07.730
- I'm not, though.

01:01:07.798 --> 01:01:10.068
He was really different
around you.

01:01:10.134 --> 01:01:13.844
And you weren't you around him.
It was weird.

01:01:13.904 --> 01:01:16.814
- He liked me, okay?!

01:01:18.075 --> 01:01:20.375
- Bu...
(door slamming)

01:01:25.482 --> 01:01:28.492
(radio): ...by the association
of men with women's names,

01:01:28.552 --> 01:01:31.562
and it hopes to draw attention
to these difficulties.

01:01:31.621 --> 01:01:34.861
- Do you want to listen
to anything in particular?

01:01:34.925 --> 01:01:36.755
- Uh, anything
to calm my nerves.

01:01:36.827 --> 01:01:39.227
(laughing)
- Okay, Blanche.

01:01:39.296 --> 01:01:41.526
(scanning stations)

01:01:41.598 --> 01:01:44.268
(soft music playing)

01:01:46.203 --> 01:01:48.143
- Better.

01:01:51.408 --> 01:01:53.438
(soft guitar music)

01:02:01.952 --> 01:02:04.392
* You might be desperate *

01:02:04.454 --> 01:02:07.194
* And on your last legs *

01:02:07.257 --> 01:02:11.997
* But you're not falling out *

01:02:14.799 --> 01:02:17.699
* I don't know how *

01:02:17.768 --> 01:02:19.898
* You always manage *

01:02:19.970 --> 01:02:24.340
* To fight another round *

01:02:27.812 --> 01:02:32.752
* You always ride it out *

01:02:32.817 --> 01:02:37.817
* You always
ride it out somehow *

01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:43.860
* You always ride it out *

01:02:43.928 --> 01:02:48.628
* You always
ride it out somehow *

01:02:48.698 --> 01:02:50.498
(siren wailing)

01:02:52.970 --> 01:02:54.870
* I come to see you *

01:02:54.939 --> 01:02:58.839
* And all
that you've been through *

01:02:58.909 --> 01:03:02.679
* Never shows up on your face *

01:03:03.814 --> 01:03:09.124
* You go on and on
and you smile so warm *

01:03:09.186 --> 01:03:11.016
* Though the world *

01:03:11.088 --> 01:03:15.228
* Can be such a cold place *

01:03:17.694 --> 01:03:22.974
* You always ride it out *

01:03:23.033 --> 01:03:27.543
* You always
ride it out somehow *

01:03:30.207 --> 01:03:34.437
* You always ride it out *

01:03:35.345 --> 01:03:40.075
* You always
ride it out somehow **

01:03:41.551 --> 01:03:43.921
(soft guitar music)

01:03:54.865 --> 01:03:56.995
(woman moaning)

01:03:57.067 --> 01:03:59.097
(crying out)

01:04:06.010 --> 01:04:07.480
(moaning)

01:04:07.544 --> 01:04:11.224
- Ugh, I'm really sorry
for being such a dick.

01:04:11.281 --> 01:04:12.681
(moaning)

01:04:12.749 --> 01:04:14.819
I really thought he liked me.

01:04:14.885 --> 01:04:17.585
- I don't even know what I did.

01:04:19.089 --> 01:04:21.629
You're, like, my best friend.

01:04:24.461 --> 01:04:26.231
- Oh, Claire.

01:04:26.296 --> 01:04:29.396
- Oh, Hal, spread me like jelly!

01:04:29.466 --> 01:04:31.396
- What are you watching?

01:04:31.468 --> 01:04:33.598
- Oh... this is amazing.

01:04:34.604 --> 01:04:36.414
(woman moaning)

01:04:36.473 --> 01:04:37.773
- Gross.

01:04:37.841 --> 01:04:40.481
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...

01:04:40.544 --> 01:04:42.384
- What?

01:04:42.446 --> 01:04:45.346
- This is vintage.
Look at her nails.

01:04:45.415 --> 01:04:49.215
- Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho!
- Look at his back.

01:04:49.286 --> 01:04:51.556
- He loves her, doesn't he?

01:04:51.621 --> 01:04:53.991
(woman crying out)

01:04:54.959 --> 01:04:56.729
- Uh, no.

01:04:56.793 --> 01:04:59.003
No, he doesn't.

01:05:00.497 --> 01:05:01.897
- But...

01:05:01.966 --> 01:05:04.066
(indistinct dialogue)

01:05:04.134 --> 01:05:07.904
But...
look what she's letting him do.

01:05:07.972 --> 01:05:10.212
(woman crying out)

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:12.580
Especially there.

01:05:12.642 --> 01:05:14.582
(woman): Ouch!

01:05:14.644 --> 01:05:17.254
Ah! Oh!

01:05:17.314 --> 01:05:20.584
Are you going to...

01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:23.590
Ah! ...the reunion?!

01:05:23.653 --> 01:05:25.763
Ah! Ooh!

01:05:25.822 --> 01:05:29.562
- Have... you ever done that?

01:05:30.327 --> 01:05:32.457
- Totally.
(man): Oh, yeah.

01:05:32.529 --> 01:05:35.729
* Row row row your boat... **

01:05:35.799 --> 01:05:39.139
- You know, we should probably
think of a plan.

01:05:39.203 --> 01:05:40.973
We're running low on funds.

01:05:41.038 --> 01:05:43.138
Do you have an ATM card?

01:05:43.207 --> 01:05:45.477
- Is that like
a pregnancy thing?

01:05:45.542 --> 01:05:49.882
- No, a bank card.
- No, we're cash only at home.

01:05:49.946 --> 01:05:51.976
Mum doesn't believe
in electronic--

01:05:52.049 --> 01:05:53.779
- Unless they're inside her?

01:05:53.850 --> 01:05:55.250
- What?
- Never mind.

01:05:55.319 --> 01:05:57.349
Seriously, though,
we need a plan.

01:05:57.421 --> 01:06:01.561
- Well... I think
I need to go to Jamboree.

01:06:01.625 --> 01:06:06.095
I mean, I really wanna go
to the Jamboree.

01:06:06.163 --> 01:06:08.503
- Really?
- Yeah!

01:06:12.502 --> 01:06:15.342
- We'll barely make it there,
though,

01:06:15.405 --> 01:06:18.305
and we'll be skimping for food.

01:06:18.375 --> 01:06:21.875
- Well, if the Jews
spent 40 years in a desert,

01:06:21.945 --> 01:06:23.475
I think we'll be fine.

01:06:23.547 --> 01:06:26.317
- Okay, well, what about me?
- What about you?

01:06:26.383 --> 01:06:29.993
- I just get the pleasure
of dropping you off at Jamboree?

01:06:30.054 --> 01:06:31.824
- You can come!

01:06:31.888 --> 01:06:33.618
- Uh...

01:06:33.690 --> 01:06:37.890
- Besides, look how many pins
you'll get to put on your map.

01:06:37.961 --> 01:06:41.901
- That was the map of the world.
We're on Highway 6.

01:06:41.965 --> 01:06:45.635
- But we're more along Highway 6
than we were yesterday.

01:06:45.702 --> 01:06:48.942
- That's a good point. Okay.
Shit, I gotta pay.

01:06:49.005 --> 01:06:51.775
- Oh, suck on a beef jerky
real slow

01:06:51.841 --> 01:06:54.181
and they'll give you a free one.

01:06:54.244 --> 01:06:56.354
- We're at a different station.

01:06:56.413 --> 01:06:58.823
- Oh, I'm pretty sure
it's a universal truth.

01:06:58.882 --> 01:07:02.222
- I'm pretty sure it's not.
- Well, you...

01:07:02.286 --> 01:07:05.286
You should just try it anyway!

01:07:07.657 --> 01:07:09.727
- Okay, alright.

01:07:09.793 --> 01:07:11.663
(Claire laughing)

01:07:11.728 --> 01:07:15.868
Yeah, you're doing it right.
Look through the viewfinder.

01:07:15.932 --> 01:07:19.302
And then focus on your feet.

01:07:20.104 --> 01:07:21.674
And then you'll notice

01:07:21.738 --> 01:07:24.538
that the focus
on the horizon softens.

01:07:24.608 --> 01:07:26.478
- Cool...!

01:07:28.078 --> 01:07:30.648
So what's all this filming for?

01:07:34.784 --> 01:07:36.354
- Oh, nothing.

01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:39.090
- It's not nothing.

01:07:39.156 --> 01:07:41.326
- It's nothing.

01:07:42.892 --> 01:07:46.662
-= My mum says that when truth
is replaced by silence,

01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:48.700
the silence is a lie.

01:07:51.135 --> 01:07:53.335
- Okay, it's for my mom.

01:07:53.403 --> 01:07:55.713
- Oh, that's so nice.

01:07:55.772 --> 01:07:58.112
Where does she live?

01:08:01.678 --> 01:08:03.578
Oh...

01:08:03.647 --> 01:08:08.417
- No, it's okay. I mean,
she died when I was six, y'know?

01:08:08.485 --> 01:08:11.355
She was
in a really bad accident.

01:08:13.157 --> 01:08:14.887
You know, she never...

01:08:14.958 --> 01:08:18.928
got to finish the film
she was making, so...

01:08:18.995 --> 01:08:21.265
I don't know, it's stupid.

01:08:24.167 --> 01:08:26.138
- It's not stupid.

01:08:26.203 --> 01:08:29.542
- I have no idea what I'm doing.

01:08:31.006 --> 01:08:32.837
- Makes two of us.

01:08:42.852 --> 01:08:44.551
- Thanks.

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:51.529
You wanna check that out?

01:08:51.595 --> 01:08:54.854
- Oh! Uh... yes!
- Yeah?

01:08:58.167 --> 01:09:01.638
- Hey, Henrietta, don't
your folks live around here?

01:09:01.705 --> 01:09:04.765
- Uh... yes.

01:09:04.841 --> 01:09:06.810
- Quick pop-in?

01:09:06.876 --> 01:09:10.145
- Uh... no, thank you.

01:09:10.214 --> 01:09:12.254
- Okay.

01:09:27.397 --> 01:09:29.767
- Hello?
- Hello?!

01:09:31.901 --> 01:09:33.770
Hello?!

01:09:35.071 --> 01:09:37.241
- Can I help you girls?

01:09:37.307 --> 01:09:40.037
- Oh. I'm here for the contest.

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:43.209
- Are you now?
- Sure am, sir.

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:48.290
- Well, we don't have karaoke
contest this early on a weekday,

01:09:48.352 --> 01:09:50.452
but that's unfortunate,
'cause, girls,

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.790
I'd love to hear you sing.

01:09:52.856 --> 01:09:56.626
- We should go.
- The stage is all yours.

01:09:57.427 --> 01:10:00.597
I could hum for ya.

01:10:00.664 --> 01:10:02.934
Hmmmmmmm...

01:10:07.271 --> 01:10:09.811
Heeeeh....

01:10:11.641 --> 01:10:13.641
Mm-hmm...

01:10:14.444 --> 01:10:16.884
Hmm-hmm-hmm...
(door closing)

01:10:16.946 --> 01:10:19.246
Hmm... hmm...

01:10:19.316 --> 01:10:21.646
Heeeh...

01:10:27.090 --> 01:10:29.960
- Could you roll the window down
for me, please?

01:10:30.026 --> 01:10:32.896
- Uh, could...
could we keep it up, please?

01:10:32.962 --> 01:10:34.862
- Window down!

01:10:37.634 --> 01:10:39.844
License and registration.

01:10:41.137 --> 01:10:43.237
Everything okay there, ma'am?

01:10:43.307 --> 01:10:44.637
- Oh, yes, she's, uh...
agoraphobic.

01:10:44.708 --> 01:10:47.178
- I won't pretend to know
what that means.

01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:49.513
- I have a great fear
of being in--

01:10:49.579 --> 01:10:52.049
- And I won't pretend to care.

01:10:52.115 --> 01:10:53.715
- Okay...

01:10:53.783 --> 01:10:55.793
- You rolled through that stop,
mister.

01:10:55.852 --> 01:10:58.392
- I did, didn't I?
- You certainly did.

01:10:58.455 --> 01:10:59.885
Bad boy.
- Well, I'm...

01:10:59.956 --> 01:11:03.186
I'm very sorry, Officer.
I'm a man of the cloth and--

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:05.599
- So why the rolling stop,
Paul?

01:11:05.662 --> 01:11:07.702
- Well, we...
we were preoccupied.

01:11:07.764 --> 01:11:11.944
Our daughters just up and left
this morning and so--

01:11:12.001 --> 01:11:14.241
- Your daughters?
- Uh, well... daughters.

01:11:14.304 --> 01:11:17.614
He has a daughter,
I have a daughter.

01:11:17.674 --> 01:11:19.244
They're separate daughters.

01:11:19.309 --> 01:11:24.309
And... and I have a sense
of where they're heading, uh,

01:11:24.381 --> 01:11:26.221
but, you know,
they could be anywhere.

01:11:26.282 --> 01:11:27.752
- Whose vehicle are they in?

01:11:27.817 --> 01:11:31.047
- They are in mine, Officer.
- Yeah, this is a rental.

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:33.190
- Oh, there goes my crush.

01:11:34.157 --> 01:11:37.427
Look, give me the license plate
number and I'll put out a call.

01:11:37.494 --> 01:11:42.204
I know some of the motel owners
around here.

01:11:42.265 --> 01:11:44.925
- Oh, okay it's, uh, S4326...

01:11:45.001 --> 01:11:47.671
(engine stalling)

01:11:47.737 --> 01:11:49.307
- Shit.

01:11:49.373 --> 01:11:52.443
Shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit!

01:11:52.509 --> 01:11:55.179
- What?
- Car's dead.

01:11:55.244 --> 01:11:58.984
- Uh... everything will be okay.

01:12:02.386 --> 01:12:03.746
What?

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:08.060
- I skip town and my dad
only calls me three times?

01:12:09.526 --> 01:12:12.756
I bet your mom's going berserk.

01:12:13.930 --> 01:12:15.870
- Yeah...

01:12:17.401 --> 01:12:19.071
Let her.

01:12:20.737 --> 01:12:24.337
- Okay, according to my phone,
there's a gas station...

01:12:24.408 --> 01:12:26.938
that way a little ways.

01:12:27.944 --> 01:12:29.514
- Should we walk?

01:12:29.579 --> 01:12:32.719
- I'm not going back in there.

01:12:32.782 --> 01:12:34.182
- Okay!

01:12:34.250 --> 01:12:36.590
Wait here one second.

01:12:36.653 --> 01:12:38.793
- Well, it looks
like a Danielle Logan

01:12:38.855 --> 01:12:42.025
checked into the Shady Pines
on Highway 8 last night.

01:12:42.091 --> 01:12:45.261
- That's my girl.
- So let's go check it out.

01:12:45.328 --> 01:12:47.358
Follow me.
- Thank you, thank you.

01:12:47.431 --> 01:12:49.701
Thank you very much.
You see?

01:12:53.102 --> 01:12:55.642
- Oh, cool!

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:58.210
Look at these!

01:12:58.274 --> 01:13:00.484
(Danielle laughing)

01:13:01.611 --> 01:13:03.551
- Henrietta!

01:13:07.451 --> 01:13:09.751
Oh!
- Oh.

01:13:13.122 --> 01:13:15.592
(giggling)
- What?

01:13:17.827 --> 01:13:19.097
- Here.

01:13:19.162 --> 01:13:21.002
As a thanks.

01:13:36.813 --> 01:13:39.183
Did I do something wrong?

01:13:41.017 --> 01:13:42.517
- No.

01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:45.250
No.

01:13:45.321 --> 01:13:48.891
That was really, really sweet.

01:13:48.958 --> 01:13:50.658
Thank you.

01:13:50.727 --> 01:13:53.527
- That's your favourite, right?

01:13:55.164 --> 01:13:57.174
- My mom used to drink it.

01:13:58.835 --> 01:14:02.105
The smell of the cork
reminds me of her.

01:14:07.410 --> 01:14:09.180
- Well...

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:13.320
We're finishing her film,

01:14:13.382 --> 01:14:16.122
we should drink it
in her honour.

01:14:16.185 --> 01:14:18.885
- I'm not gonna argue with that.

01:14:21.525 --> 01:14:23.285
This looks good on you.

01:14:23.359 --> 01:14:25.899
- Thanks! I like yours, too.

01:14:28.364 --> 01:14:30.134
(music)

01:14:30.199 --> 01:14:32.569
(indistinct chatter)

01:14:42.912 --> 01:14:46.352
- Yeah, the boy left
around 6 a.m. this morning.

01:14:46.415 --> 01:14:47.915
He seemed kind of stressed.

01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:49.994
Also,
someone owes me some money.

01:14:50.053 --> 01:14:53.323
There's an outstanding charge
for, uh, a "blue" movie.

01:14:53.389 --> 01:14:55.659
- Blue?

01:14:55.725 --> 01:14:58.485
- Pfft. Good girls, I see.
- Yeah.

01:14:58.562 --> 01:15:01.132
- The best. Well, mine is.

01:15:01.197 --> 01:15:03.567
- Which flick?
- Oh, it's a good one.

01:15:03.633 --> 01:15:05.303
Uh, Second Cousin
Twice Removed.

01:15:05.368 --> 01:15:07.998
Classic.

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:12.639
- What? What?

01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:17.149
There was definitely something
in that look.

01:15:17.213 --> 01:15:19.553
(music)

01:15:19.616 --> 01:15:21.746
(indistinct chatter)

01:15:21.818 --> 01:15:25.118
- Best friends!
(laughter)

01:15:27.323 --> 01:15:29.793
(...music...)

01:15:39.769 --> 01:15:41.969
(...music...)

01:15:59.689 --> 01:16:01.789
(...music...)

01:16:03.459 --> 01:16:05.289
- Whoo!

01:16:11.801 --> 01:16:13.571
(music fading)

01:16:13.637 --> 01:16:15.667
(howling)

01:16:18.174 --> 01:16:19.914
This is...

01:16:19.976 --> 01:16:21.406
(gasping)

01:16:21.477 --> 01:16:24.147
This is so...

01:16:24.213 --> 01:16:25.923
cool!

01:16:25.982 --> 01:16:30.552
- Are you little girls out here
in the forest all by yourselves?

01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:33.020
- Oh, we sure are.

01:16:33.089 --> 01:16:36.129
- Welcome
to the full-moon party.

01:16:36.192 --> 01:16:38.032
(phone ringing)

01:16:39.996 --> 01:16:41.966
Hello?

01:16:42.031 --> 01:16:43.301
So sorry.

01:16:43.366 --> 01:16:45.126
Yeah?

01:16:45.201 --> 01:16:46.941
No, no.

01:16:48.004 --> 01:16:50.674
It's like my one big night.

01:16:51.641 --> 01:16:55.611
We can get whatever's
in the basement out tomorrow.

01:16:55.679 --> 01:16:58.049
Yeah, look, I gotta go.

01:16:59.348 --> 01:17:01.148
So sorry.
(chuckling)

01:17:01.217 --> 01:17:02.747
You guys tripping?

01:17:02.819 --> 01:17:06.959
You have to try
my super-spicy space cakes.

01:17:07.023 --> 01:17:09.993
(music playing)
What's the matter?

01:17:10.059 --> 01:17:12.429
- We're lost
and our car broke down.

01:17:12.495 --> 01:17:13.925
- Claire!

01:17:13.997 --> 01:17:17.197
- That is such a bummer. Where?

01:17:17.266 --> 01:17:18.966
- On our way here, yeah.

01:17:19.035 --> 01:17:21.705
- Look...
here's what needs to happen.

01:17:21.771 --> 01:17:24.441
You need to eat some cake,

01:17:24.507 --> 01:17:26.637
you need to get silly,

01:17:26.710 --> 01:17:28.380
and you need to dance.

01:17:28.444 --> 01:17:31.554
You're totally safe with me.

01:17:32.315 --> 01:17:36.815
Trust me. Seriously,
you girls are in for a treat.

01:17:36.886 --> 01:17:39.386
- Ah... ah...

01:17:40.289 --> 01:17:43.829
Whoa...
(speaking with mouth full)

01:17:43.893 --> 01:17:45.493
That's great.

01:17:45.561 --> 01:17:47.501
- Let's go.
- It is so good.

01:17:47.563 --> 01:17:49.903
- Yeah.
(laughter)

01:17:49.966 --> 01:17:52.996
(beat-heavy music)

01:18:15.324 --> 01:18:18.464
(demonic voice)
(techno music)

01:19:25.829 --> 01:19:28.099
- Now don't freak out.
Don't fall.

01:19:28.164 --> 01:19:30.104
- Ah.
- Okay?

01:19:30.166 --> 01:19:33.436
- Yeah.
- But imagine that wall gone.

01:19:33.502 --> 01:19:35.912
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

01:19:35.972 --> 01:19:38.742
Bedroom - bang.

01:19:38.808 --> 01:19:40.978
Upstairs fireplace,

01:19:41.044 --> 01:19:43.414
second bedroom.

01:19:43.479 --> 01:19:45.979
Oh, my fuck,

01:19:46.049 --> 01:19:48.479
his croissants are to die for.

01:19:48.551 --> 01:19:49.991
Must have one now.

01:19:50.053 --> 01:19:52.063
Oh, you're up.

01:19:58.327 --> 01:19:59.727
- 'Morning.

01:19:59.795 --> 01:20:02.465
- Hi.

01:20:02.531 --> 01:20:04.671
- Hello. You're handsome.

01:20:04.733 --> 01:20:07.043
(chuckling)
- I'm Hal.

01:20:07.103 --> 01:20:10.343
- I'm Danielle. This is Claire.

01:20:10.406 --> 01:20:11.976
- We're girls.

01:20:12.041 --> 01:20:15.211
- I can tell. Hungry?

01:20:15.278 --> 01:20:18.208
- Starved.
- Follow me.

01:20:19.148 --> 01:20:21.918
- Mmm...
- We have more if you want.

01:20:21.985 --> 01:20:25.445
- Only if you have more
of this insane jam.

01:20:25.521 --> 01:20:28.821
- Jelly jams!
These are my jelly jams.

01:20:28.892 --> 01:20:30.462
(laughter)

01:20:30.526 --> 01:20:32.596
- Yes! Those are
your little jelly jams.

01:20:32.661 --> 01:20:35.661
- These are my jelly--
- I really like your jelly jams.

01:20:35.731 --> 01:20:38.471
- You like my jelly jams?
- They're really nice ones.

01:20:38.534 --> 01:20:41.504
- I really like your jelly jams.
- Thanks. You do?

01:20:41.570 --> 01:20:43.370
- Mm-hmm.
- Aw...!

01:20:43.439 --> 01:20:45.269
(laughter)

01:20:47.911 --> 01:20:49.581
- The car's been spotted.

01:20:49.645 --> 01:20:52.415
- Oh, wonderful.
- Uh, so we'll follow you, then?

01:20:52.481 --> 01:20:54.651
- No, no, no, we'll take my car.
Leave yours here.

01:20:54.717 --> 01:20:56.287
- Oh, that's very kind of you.

01:20:56.352 --> 01:20:59.522
- It is. But I'm not going
to drive you anywhere

01:20:59.588 --> 01:21:02.758
until you tell me
what's really going on here.

01:21:02.825 --> 01:21:04.625
- Here?

01:21:09.365 --> 01:21:11.195
(water running)
(groaning softly)

01:21:11.267 --> 01:21:13.437
(man): Ahem.
(Claire giggling)

01:21:15.604 --> 01:21:17.214
- Where's Artemis?

01:21:17.273 --> 01:21:19.713
- He's gone
to get your car fixed.

01:21:19.775 --> 01:21:22.145
- Oh, that's wonderful.

01:21:23.279 --> 01:21:25.349
Can I help with anything?

01:21:25.414 --> 01:21:29.054
- Well, uh, you can crack
some eggs over there.

01:21:29.118 --> 01:21:31.588
- Oh, I don't know
how to do that.

01:21:31.654 --> 01:21:33.324
- Seriously?

01:21:34.123 --> 01:21:36.433
- We buy the yolks
in the carton.

01:21:36.492 --> 01:21:39.362
(laughing)
- That is so suburban.

01:21:39.428 --> 01:21:42.568
Uh, come here, let me show you.

01:21:42.631 --> 01:21:44.571
Here we go.

01:21:44.633 --> 01:21:46.643
Okay, grab an egg.

01:21:47.436 --> 01:21:50.666
Okay, bump it just hard enough
to crack the shell,

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:53.909
but gentle enough
not to damage the egg inside.

01:21:53.977 --> 01:21:56.807
Ready? Okay, now...
(Claire exclaiming)

01:21:57.613 --> 01:22:01.753
There you go. Look at that,
look at that, look at that!

01:22:01.817 --> 01:22:03.587
There we go.
- Oh!

01:22:03.652 --> 01:22:06.362
- Not bad, babe.
- Wow...

01:22:07.656 --> 01:22:09.926
Our house used to get egged.

01:22:09.993 --> 01:22:11.763
- That's awful.

01:22:11.827 --> 01:22:13.527
- Yeah.

01:22:17.466 --> 01:22:19.736
- There you go.
- How am I doing?

01:22:19.802 --> 01:22:23.042
- I'd hire ya.
When you drop a little shell,

01:22:23.106 --> 01:22:25.366
you just scrape it out
like that.

01:22:25.441 --> 01:22:28.211
There ya go.
Nothing to it. Keep going.

01:22:28.277 --> 01:22:31.247
- Uh... that's my car!

01:22:31.314 --> 01:22:32.684
- The wagon?
- Uh-huh.

01:22:32.748 --> 01:22:35.048
- Who's the long-haired guy
under the hood?

01:22:35.118 --> 01:22:37.088
- Did you see my Claire?!

01:22:37.153 --> 01:22:39.223
(siren wailing)

01:22:41.190 --> 01:22:43.230
(brakes squealing)

01:22:56.705 --> 01:22:59.075
(humming happily)

01:23:00.043 --> 01:23:02.313
- Oh! Mmm!

01:23:02.378 --> 01:23:04.508
Ah, they smell amazing!

01:23:04.580 --> 01:23:07.580
- It's all that vanilla
you added.

01:23:07.650 --> 01:23:10.420
- Uh, we have guests.
- More guests.

01:23:15.891 --> 01:23:17.161
- Smells great in here.
- Thanks.

01:23:17.226 --> 01:23:20.396
- Should we get the coffee
flowing here?

01:23:20.463 --> 01:23:21.863
- Hal?

01:23:21.930 --> 01:23:24.630
- Henrietta?
- Hello, Hal.

01:23:24.700 --> 01:23:28.470
- Mum? You know each other?
How do you know each other?

01:23:28.537 --> 01:23:31.607
- Oh, Jesus. Screw the coffee.
You have anything stronger?

01:23:31.674 --> 01:23:33.814
- How do you know each other?
- Officer Lori,

01:23:33.876 --> 01:23:36.646
Danielle, I think
we should leave them alone.

01:23:36.712 --> 01:23:39.622
Oh, dear God.
(Danielle groaning)

01:23:39.682 --> 01:23:41.752
- Oh, Jesus. Here.

01:23:41.817 --> 01:23:43.647
- I'm sorry.

01:23:43.719 --> 01:23:46.689
- Danielle, let's... let's...
let's... let's go.

01:23:46.755 --> 01:23:48.315
- Um, okay.

01:23:48.391 --> 01:23:51.661
Hal... Claire's your daughter.

01:23:51.727 --> 01:23:53.627
- What?!

01:23:56.932 --> 01:23:58.702
(child giggling)

01:24:05.674 --> 01:24:07.084
- Excuse me?

01:24:08.977 --> 01:24:11.777
I'm really sorry, Claire.

01:24:11.847 --> 01:24:13.317
I had no idea.
- Oh!

01:24:13.382 --> 01:24:16.692
- Artemis, grab a towel,
grab a towel. I got her hair.

01:24:16.752 --> 01:24:19.692
- Sweetheart?
- Oh, baby. Towel. Oh, baby.

01:24:19.755 --> 01:24:22.485
Oof. I'm really sorry
about this, people.

01:24:22.558 --> 01:24:24.758
- Hal, would you like
to tell your daughter

01:24:24.827 --> 01:24:26.257
what line of work you're in?

01:24:26.329 --> 01:24:29.699
- Um, was in.
And you're being inappropriate.

01:24:29.765 --> 01:24:33.835
- And-and I'm very sorry,
who are you exactly?

01:24:33.902 --> 01:24:36.542
- Hal's lover.

01:24:37.606 --> 01:24:41.636
- What? Tell me.
- Tell her, Hal.

01:24:41.710 --> 01:24:43.410
- You're Hal Spreadum!

01:24:43.479 --> 01:24:45.679
That's an impressive
body of work.

01:24:45.748 --> 01:24:50.948
- Oh... he was in that movie
we saw, Claire.

01:24:51.019 --> 01:24:53.359
(soft music)

01:24:54.490 --> 01:24:57.760
- That woman didn't love you.

01:24:57.826 --> 01:25:00.196
- I know.

01:25:02.998 --> 01:25:05.228
(soft piano music)

01:25:44.207 --> 01:25:46.237
- Great jam.

01:25:53.816 --> 01:25:56.246
(...soft piano music...)

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:14.600
- Alright, you've had enough.
You're done.

01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:19.440
(soft piano music)

01:26:21.610 --> 01:26:24.850
So here's what's gonna
go down next, okay?

01:26:24.913 --> 01:26:26.983
Your car needs attention,

01:26:27.049 --> 01:26:29.749
so I can take the both of you
in the cruiser.

01:26:29.818 --> 01:26:32.488
Paul and Danielle
can take the rental car.

01:26:32.555 --> 01:26:34.785
- No.

01:26:34.857 --> 01:26:37.587
I'm sorry, but no.

01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:43.200
Mum...I love you
with every core of my being.

01:26:43.266 --> 01:26:45.526
I do.

01:26:45.601 --> 01:26:48.201
But I'm going
to Pump Up the Jamboree,

01:26:48.271 --> 01:26:50.471
with Danielle.

01:26:51.374 --> 01:26:54.384
You guys can do
whatever you wanna do.

01:26:54.443 --> 01:26:56.253
But that's what I'm doing,

01:26:57.746 --> 01:26:59.346
Okay?

01:27:30.313 --> 01:27:32.353
- You don't need that.

01:27:35.851 --> 01:27:37.051
(Danielle sighing)

01:27:37.119 --> 01:27:40.259
- You... you just don't get it,
do you, Paul?

01:27:40.323 --> 01:27:43.363
- I hate it
when you call me that.

01:27:44.159 --> 01:27:46.699
Why can't you call me Dad?

01:27:50.165 --> 01:27:51.865
Hey...

01:27:53.502 --> 01:27:56.442
I'm trying to love you here,
Danielle.

01:27:58.341 --> 01:28:00.941
- Well,
then that makes two of us.

01:28:08.517 --> 01:28:10.617
- You okay?

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:13.890
- Define okay.

01:28:16.024 --> 01:28:17.934
- Okay, look...

01:28:17.993 --> 01:28:21.233
I am very worried
about your drinking.

01:28:21.296 --> 01:28:23.466
I find bottles all the time.

01:28:23.532 --> 01:28:25.902
- Oh, she doesn't drink them.

01:28:27.770 --> 01:28:30.670
The smell of the cork
reminds her of her mom.

01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:33.740
I think it's nice.

01:28:49.057 --> 01:28:50.787
How is it in there?

01:28:50.859 --> 01:28:53.599
- Oh, it's weird
and heavy and awkward.

01:28:53.662 --> 01:28:57.272
Kind of like how I was
in high school.

01:28:57.332 --> 01:28:59.802
They're having
a long-overdue chat.

01:28:59.868 --> 01:29:03.568
It's a good thing.
- Man, you guys are awesome.

01:29:03.639 --> 01:29:06.479
- Ah, tell me something
I don't already know.

01:29:06.542 --> 01:29:09.952
(laughter)
- Thank you for everything.

01:29:11.079 --> 01:29:13.279
- It's my pleasure.

01:29:13.348 --> 01:29:14.978
You know what?

01:29:15.050 --> 01:29:18.050
We could kind of use a hand
around here

01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:20.020
until things get up and running.

01:29:20.088 --> 01:29:22.088
Just putting it out there.

01:29:25.961 --> 01:29:27.961
- Awesome.

01:29:29.398 --> 01:29:31.398
(Claire): Ah...

01:29:36.605 --> 01:29:38.165
- Thank you.

01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:40.510
- You're welcome.

01:29:41.276 --> 01:29:43.806
- Uh, girls? We, uh...

01:29:45.448 --> 01:29:47.748
- Behave yourselves!
- Okay.

01:29:47.816 --> 01:29:49.116
(laughter)

01:29:50.118 --> 01:29:52.918
- That's your dad.

01:29:52.988 --> 01:29:54.388
(soft music)

01:29:54.457 --> 01:29:55.857
- We could help.
- I wanna go.

01:29:55.924 --> 01:29:57.534
- We'll get you home
soon enough.

01:29:57.593 --> 01:29:59.433
- No, I wanna go
to the jamboree.

01:29:59.495 --> 01:30:00.725
I wanna support my baby.

01:30:00.796 --> 01:30:05.096
- Wait, I want to support
my baby, too.

01:30:05.167 --> 01:30:07.237
- To the jamboree, then.

01:30:07.302 --> 01:30:09.242
(chuckling)

01:30:09.304 --> 01:30:12.244
- Here we go, doll.
- Okay.

01:30:12.307 --> 01:30:14.137
Okay.

01:30:15.811 --> 01:30:18.011
- So glad you could come.

01:30:19.648 --> 01:30:23.018
Okay, it's almost speech time.
(woman): ...our saviour!

01:30:24.487 --> 01:30:26.517
(Claire giggling)

01:30:28.957 --> 01:30:33.627
I felt good about the way
I looked in my bathing suit,

01:30:33.696 --> 01:30:37.866
and I found the courage
to go down the water slide.

01:30:37.933 --> 01:30:40.703
I found the courage
through his love.

01:30:40.769 --> 01:30:42.769
I love you, Christ Jesus!

01:30:42.838 --> 01:30:45.408
I love you with every pore!

01:30:45.474 --> 01:30:47.544
(crowd cheering)

01:30:49.578 --> 01:30:53.248
- Thank you so much, so much,
Maxine. How bout that, huh?

01:30:53.315 --> 01:30:55.715
That was some beautiful,
beautiful, heartfelt testimony.

01:30:55.784 --> 01:30:58.524
Thank you, thank you.
He's everywhere, isn't he?

01:30:58.587 --> 01:31:00.457
(laughing)
Alright, now this is...

01:31:00.523 --> 01:31:02.093
this is very exciting.

01:31:02.157 --> 01:31:06.497
Please, ladies and gentlemen,
welcome for the very first time,

01:31:06.562 --> 01:31:10.472
representing Penderson County,
our very own Claire Woods.

01:31:10.533 --> 01:31:13.873
Let's pump it up for Claire!
Huh?

01:31:13.936 --> 01:31:15.766
Ha-ha-ha!

01:31:15.838 --> 01:31:17.268
Yeah.

01:31:17.339 --> 01:31:19.209
Watch your step.

01:31:27.382 --> 01:31:30.492
- Thank you... Pastor Paul...

01:31:30.553 --> 01:31:32.453
for inviting me...

01:31:32.521 --> 01:31:34.491
to speak here.

01:31:34.557 --> 01:31:37.227
I've...

01:31:37.292 --> 01:31:39.632
been asked to speak...

01:31:39.695 --> 01:31:42.225
about how my... spirituality

01:31:42.297 --> 01:31:47.237
has lead me to where I am now.

01:31:49.204 --> 01:31:51.274
Or... something.

01:32:08.757 --> 01:32:11.427
All I know is that...

01:32:11.493 --> 01:32:14.163
you have to treat spirituality

01:32:14.229 --> 01:32:16.359
like a breakfast buffet.

01:32:16.431 --> 01:32:18.531
Only eat what you crave.

01:32:18.601 --> 01:32:20.571
There's a reason you crave it.

01:32:20.636 --> 01:32:22.296
And I have a new friend.

01:32:22.370 --> 01:32:24.670
(laughing)

01:32:25.608 --> 01:32:28.278
And she's making
all the difference.

01:32:29.077 --> 01:32:33.217
And I just found out
that my dad's gay.

01:32:33.281 --> 01:32:36.821
And we made amazing croissants
this morning.

01:32:36.885 --> 01:32:40.085
And...
and he and his boyfriend are...

01:32:40.155 --> 01:32:45.255
creating a home away from home
for lost travellers.

01:32:45.327 --> 01:32:47.157
Isn't that all of us?

01:32:47.963 --> 01:32:50.673
We need to step away...

01:32:52.635 --> 01:32:54.835
...run away...
(laughing)

01:32:55.638 --> 01:32:57.638
...knowing that...

01:32:57.706 --> 01:33:00.736
along the way...

01:33:00.809 --> 01:33:03.409
there will be amazing...

01:33:03.478 --> 01:33:06.008
and terrifying surprises

01:33:06.081 --> 01:33:07.921
at every turn.

01:33:07.983 --> 01:33:13.093
And guys that make you suck
on beef jerky for a discount.

01:33:14.990 --> 01:33:17.930
But all of that doesn't matter,

01:33:17.993 --> 01:33:21.433
because we're all just trying
to do the best we can

01:33:21.496 --> 01:33:23.496
with what we're given.

01:33:23.565 --> 01:33:27.265
And, Pastor Paul,
you have it wrong.

01:33:27.335 --> 01:33:31.765
It's not our responsibility
to suffer the consequences

01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:34.610
of our actions...

01:33:34.677 --> 01:33:36.437
but...

01:33:36.511 --> 01:33:38.611
rather celebrate them!

01:33:39.882 --> 01:33:41.982
(whistling)
- Whoo-hoo!!

01:33:43.618 --> 01:33:45.718
(music)

01:33:49.925 --> 01:33:54.055
* We're all traveling
down this lonely road *

01:33:55.163 --> 01:33:59.073
* We're all tumbling
in the tides *

01:34:00.502 --> 01:34:04.812
* But I am here
to simply let you know *

01:34:04.873 --> 01:34:09.243
* I'll be right by your side *

01:34:11.513 --> 01:34:15.423
* We all hear
that voice inside our souls *

01:34:16.351 --> 01:34:20.091
* A wind that whispers
in the night *

01:34:22.057 --> 01:34:26.127
* Whatever lies
down this old winding road *

01:34:26.194 --> 01:34:31.274
* I'll be right by your side *

01:34:32.735 --> 01:34:34.465
* Oh oh oh oh *

01:34:34.536 --> 01:34:37.836
* Don't have to face
this world alone *

01:34:37.906 --> 01:34:40.006
* Oh oh oh *

01:34:40.075 --> 01:34:43.205
* I'll be the place
that you call home *

01:34:43.278 --> 01:34:44.708
* Oh oh oh *

01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:49.620
* The pages turn
and years go by *

01:34:50.552 --> 01:34:53.922
* And I'll be
right by your side *

01:34:56.558 --> 01:35:00.428
* A hundred books
can't tell you what to do *

01:35:02.097 --> 01:35:05.427
* A thousand songs
that still don't rhyme *

01:35:07.402 --> 01:35:11.712
* Be yourself
and keep your heart true *

01:35:11.774 --> 01:35:17.714
* I'll be right by your side *

01:35:17.780 --> 01:35:20.050
* Oh oh oh oh *

01:35:20.115 --> 01:35:23.385
* Don't have to face
this world alone *

01:35:23.451 --> 01:35:25.351
* Oh oh oh *

01:35:25.420 --> 01:35:28.560
* I'll be the place
that you call home *

01:35:28.623 --> 01:35:30.863
* Oh oh oh *

01:35:30.926 --> 01:35:34.656
* The pages turn
and years go by *

01:35:35.597 --> 01:35:40.167
* And I'll be
right by your side *

01:35:41.603 --> 01:35:46.983
* It doesn't matter where
we choose to plant our roots *

01:35:47.042 --> 01:35:51.012
* We'll always blossom
in each other's light *

01:35:52.447 --> 01:35:56.887
* And from the shelter
of your open arms *

01:35:56.952 --> 01:36:01.592
* You look into my eyes *

01:36:01.656 --> 01:36:05.226
* And say oh oh oh oh *

01:36:05.293 --> 01:36:08.603
* Don't have to face
this world alone *

01:36:08.663 --> 01:36:10.933
* Oh oh oh *

01:36:10.999 --> 01:36:13.599
* I'll be the place
that you call home *

01:36:13.668 --> 01:36:16.398
* Oh oh oh *

01:36:16.471 --> 01:36:20.211
* The pages turn
and years go by *

01:36:21.009 --> 01:36:25.379
* And I'll be
right by your side *

01:36:26.314 --> 01:36:31.054
* And I'll be
right by your side *

01:36:35.690 --> 01:36:37.530
